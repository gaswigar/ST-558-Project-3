chapter
i
the
myth
of
osiris
in
ancient
egypt
the
god
whose
death
and
resurrection
were
annually
celebrated
with
alternate
sorrow
and
joy
was
osiris
the
most
popular
of
all
egyptian
deities
and
there
are
good
grounds
for
classing
him
in
one
of
his
aspects
with
adonis
and
attis
as
a
personification
of
the
great
yearly
vicissitudes
of
nature
especially
of
the
corn
but
the
immense
vogue
which
he
enjoyed
for
many
ages
induced
his
devoted
worshippers
to
heap
upon
him
the
attributes
and
powers
of
many
other
gods
so
that
it
is
not
always
easy
to
strip
him
so
to
say
of
his
borrowed
plumes
and
to
restore
them
to
their
proper
owners
in
the
following
pages
i
do
not
pretend
to
enumerate
and
analyse
all
the
alien
elements
which
thus
gathered
round
the
popular
deity
all
that
i
shall
attempt
to
do
is
to
peel
off
these
accretions
and
to
exhibit
the
god
as
far
as
possible
in
his
primitive
simplicity
the
discoveries
of
recent
years
in
egypt
enable
us
to
do
so
with
more
confidence
now
than
when
i
first
addressed
myself
to
the
problem
many
years
ago
the
story
of
osiris
is
told
in
a
connected
form
only
by
plutarch
whose
narrative
has
been
confirmed
and
to
some
extent
amplified
in
modern
times
by
the
evidence
of
the
monuments
of
the
monuments
which
illustrate
the
myth
or
legend
of
osiris
the
oldest
are
a
long
series
of
hymns
prayers
incantations
and
liturgies
which
have
been
found
engraved
in
hieroglyphics
on
the
walls
passages
and
galleries
of
five
pyramids
at
sakkara
from
the
place
where
they
were
discovered
these
ancient
religious
records
are
known
as
the
pyramid
texts
they
date
from
the
fifth
and
sixth
dynasties
and
the
period
of
time
during
which
they
were
carved
on
the
pyramids
is
believed
to
have
been
roughly
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
from
about
the
year
onward
but
from
their
contents
it
appears
that
many
of
these
documents
were
drawn
up
much
earlier
for
in
some
of
them
there
are
references
to
works
which
have
perished
and
in
others
there
are
political
allusions
which
seem
to
show
that
the
passages
containing
them
must
have
been
composed
at
a
time
when
the
northern
and
southern
kingdoms
were
still
independent
and
hostile
states
and
had
not
yet
coalesced
into
a
single
realm
under
the
sway
of
one
powerful
monarch
as
the
union
of
the
kingdoms
appears
to
have
taken
place
about
three
thousand
four
hundred
years
before
our
era
the
whole
period
covered
by
the
composition
of
the
pyramid
texts
probably
did
not
fall
short
of
a
thousand
years
thus
the
documents
form
the
oldest
body
of
religious
literature
surviving
to
us
from
the
ancient
world
and
occupy
a
place
in
the
history
of
egyptian
language
and
civilization
like
that
which
the
vedic
hymns
and
incantations
occupy
in
the
history
of
aryan
speech
and
culture
the
special
purpose
for
which
these
texts
were
engraved
on
the
pyramids
was
to
ensure
the
eternal
life
and
felicity
of
the
dead
kings
who
slept
beneath
these
colossal
monuments
hence
the
dominant
note
that
sounds
through
them
all
is
an
insistent
a
passionate
protest
against
the
reality
of
death
indeed
the
word
death
never
occurs
in
the
pyramid
texts
except
to
be
scornfully
denied
or
to
be
applied
to
an
enemy
again
and
again
the
indomitable
assurance
is
repeated
that
the
dead
man
did
not
die
but
lives
king
teti
has
not
died
the
death
he
has
become
a
glorious
one
in
the
ho
king
unis
thou
didst
not
depart
dead
thou
didst
depart
thou
hast
departed
that
thou
mightest
live
thou
hast
not
departed
that
thou
mightest
thou
diest
this
king
pepi
dies
have
ye
said
that
he
would
die
he
dies
not
this
king
pepi
lives
for
live
thou
shalt
not
thou
livest
thou
livest
raise
thee
thou
diest
not
stand
up
raise
thee
o
lofty
one
among
the
imperishable
stars
thou
perishest
not
thus
for
egyptian
kings
death
was
swallowed
up
in
victory
and
through
their
tears
egyptian
mourners
might
ask
like
christian
mourners
thousands
of
years
afterwards
o
death
where
is
thy
sting
o
grave
where
is
thy
victory
now
it
is
significant
that
in
these
ancient
documents
though
the
myth
or
legend
of
osiris
is
not
set
forth
at
length
it
is
often
alluded
to
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
hence
we
may
legitimately
infer
the
great
antiquity
of
the
osirian
tradition
in
egypt
indeed
so
numerous
are
the
allusions
to
it
in
the
pyramid
texts
that
by
their
help
we
could
reconstruct
the
story
in
its
main
outlines
even
without
the
narrative
of
plutarch
thus
the
discovery
of
these
texts
has
confirmed
our
belief
in
the
accuracy
and
fidelity
of
the
greek
writer
and
we
may
accept
his
account
with
confidence
even
when
it
records
incidents
or
details
which
have
not
yet
been
verified
by
a
comparison
with
original
egyptian
sources
the
tragic
tale
runs
thus
osiris
was
the
offspring
of
an
intrigue
between
the
seb
keb
or
geb
as
the
name
is
sometimes
transliterated
and
the
nut
the
greeks
identified
his
parents
with
their
own
deities
cronus
and
rhea
when
the
ra
perceived
that
his
wife
nut
had
been
unfaithful
to
him
he
declared
with
a
curse
that
she
should
be
delivered
of
the
child
in
no
month
and
no
year
but
the
goddess
had
another
lover
the
god
thoth
or
hermes
as
the
greeks
called
him
and
he
playing
at
draughts
with
the
moon
won
from
her
a
part
of
every
day
and
having
compounded
five
whole
days
out
of
these
parts
he
added
them
to
the
egyptian
year
of
three
hundred
and
sixty
days
this
was
the
mythical
origin
of
the
five
supplementary
days
which
the
egyptians
annually
inserted
at
the
end
of
every
year
in
order
to
establish
a
harmony
between
lunar
and
solar
time
on
these
five
days
regarded
as
outside
the
year
of
twelve
months
the
curse
of
the
did
not
rest
and
accordingly
osiris
was
born
on
the
first
of
them
at
his
nativity
a
voice
rang
out
proclaiming
that
the
lord
of
all
had
come
into
the
world
some
say
that
a
certain
pamyles
heard
a
voice
from
the
temple
at
thebes
bidding
him
announce
with
a
shout
that
a
great
king
the
beneficent
osiris
was
born
but
osiris
was
not
the
only
child
of
his
mother
on
the
second
of
the
supplementary
days
she
gave
birth
to
the
elder
horus
on
the
third
to
the
god
set
whom
the
greeks
called
typhon
on
the
fourth
to
the
goddess
isis
and
on
the
fifth
to
the
goddess
nephthys
afterwards
set
married
his
sister
nephthys
and
osiris
married
his
sister
isis
reigning
as
a
king
on
earth
osiris
reclaimed
the
egyptians
from
savagery
gave
them
laws
and
taught
them
to
worship
the
gods
before
his
time
the
egyptians
had
been
cannibals
but
isis
the
sister
and
wife
of
osiris
discovered
wheat
and
barley
growing
wild
and
osiris
introduced
the
cultivation
of
these
grains
amongst
his
people
who
forthwith
abandoned
cannibalism
and
took
kindly
to
a
corn
diet
moreover
osiris
is
said
to
have
been
the
first
to
gather
fruit
from
trees
to
train
the
vine
to
poles
and
to
tread
the
grapes
eager
to
communicate
these
beneficent
discoveries
to
all
mankind
he
committed
the
whole
government
of
egypt
to
his
wife
isis
and
travelled
over
the
world
diffusing
the
blessings
of
civilization
and
agriculture
wherever
he
went
in
countries
where
a
harsh
climate
or
niggardly
soil
forbade
the
cultivation
of
the
vine
he
taught
the
inhabitants
to
console
themselves
for
the
want
of
wine
by
brewing
beer
from
barley
loaded
with
the
wealth
that
had
been
showered
upon
him
by
grateful
nations
he
returned
to
egypt
and
on
account
of
the
benefits
he
had
conferred
on
mankind
he
was
unanimously
hailed
and
worshipped
as
a
deity
but
his
brother
set
whom
the
greeks
called
typhon
with
others
plotted
against
him
having
taken
the
measure
of
his
good
brother
s
body
by
stealth
the
bad
brother
typhon
fashioned
and
highly
decorated
a
coffer
of
the
same
size
and
once
when
they
were
all
drinking
and
making
merry
he
brought
in
the
coffer
and
jestingly
promised
to
give
it
to
the
one
whom
it
should
fit
exactly
well
they
all
tried
one
after
the
other
but
it
fitted
none
of
them
last
of
all
osiris
stepped
into
it
and
lay
down
on
that
the
conspirators
ran
and
slammed
the
lid
down
on
him
nailed
it
fast
soldered
it
with
molten
lead
and
flung
the
coffer
into
the
nile
this
happened
on
the
seventeenth
day
of
the
month
athyr
when
the
sun
is
in
the
sign
of
the
scorpion
and
in
the
year
of
the
reign
or
the
life
of
osiris
when
isis
heard
of
it
she
sheared
off
a
lock
of
her
hair
put
on
mourning
attire
and
wandered
disconsolately
up
and
down
seeking
the
body
by
the
advice
of
the
god
of
wisdom
she
took
refuge
in
the
papyrus
swamps
of
the
delta
seven
scorpions
accompanied
her
in
her
flight
one
evening
when
she
was
weary
she
came
to
the
house
of
a
woman
who
alarmed
at
the
sight
of
the
scorpions
shut
the
door
in
her
face
then
one
of
the
scorpions
crept
under
the
door
and
stung
the
child
of
the
woman
that
he
died
but
when
isis
heard
the
mother
s
lamentation
her
heart
was
touched
and
she
laid
her
hands
on
the
child
and
uttered
her
powerful
spells
so
the
poison
was
driven
out
of
the
child
and
he
lived
afterwards
isis
herself
gave
birth
to
a
son
in
the
swamps
she
had
conceived
him
while
she
fluttered
in
the
form
of
a
hawk
over
the
corpse
of
her
dead
husband
the
infant
was
the
younger
horus
who
in
his
youth
bore
the
name
of
harpocrates
that
is
the
child
horus
him
buto
the
goddess
of
the
north
hid
from
the
wrath
of
his
wicked
uncle
set
yet
she
could
not
guard
him
from
all
mishap
for
one
day
when
isis
came
to
her
little
son
s
she
found
him
stretched
lifeless
and
rigid
on
the
ground
a
scorpion
had
stung
him
then
isis
prayed
to
the
ra
for
help
the
god
hearkened
to
her
and
staid
his
bark
in
the
sky
and
sent
down
thoth
to
teach
her
the
spell
by
which
she
might
restore
her
son
to
life
she
uttered
the
words
of
power
and
straightway
the
poison
flowed
from
the
body
of
horus
air
passed
into
him
and
he
lived
then
thoth
ascended
up
into
the
sky
and
took
his
place
once
more
in
the
bark
of
the
sun
and
the
bright
pomp
passed
onward
jubilant
meantime
the
coffer
containing
the
body
of
osiris
had
floated
down
the
river
and
away
out
to
sea
till
at
last
it
drifted
ashore
at
byblus
on
the
coast
of
syria
here
a
fine
shot
up
suddenly
and
enclosed
the
chest
in
its
trunk
the
king
of
the
country
admiring
the
growth
of
the
tree
had
it
cut
down
and
made
into
a
pillar
of
his
house
but
he
did
not
know
that
the
coffer
with
the
dead
osiris
was
in
it
word
of
this
came
to
isis
and
she
journeyed
to
byblus
and
sat
down
by
the
well
in
humble
guise
her
face
wet
with
tears
to
none
would
she
speak
till
the
king
s
handmaidens
came
and
them
she
greeted
kindly
and
braided
their
hair
and
breathed
on
them
from
her
own
divine
body
a
wondrous
perfume
but
when
the
queen
beheld
the
braids
of
her
handmaidens
hair
and
smelt
the
sweet
smell
that
emanated
from
them
she
sent
for
the
stranger
woman
and
took
her
into
her
house
and
made
her
the
nurse
of
her
child
but
isis
gave
the
babe
her
finger
instead
of
her
breast
to
suck
and
at
night
she
began
to
burn
all
that
was
mortal
of
him
away
while
she
herself
in
the
likeness
of
a
swallow
fluttered
round
the
pillar
that
contained
her
dead
brother
twittering
mournfully
but
the
queen
spied
what
she
was
doing
and
shrieked
out
when
she
saw
her
child
in
flames
and
thereby
she
hindered
him
from
becoming
immortal
then
the
goddess
revealed
herself
and
begged
for
the
pillar
of
the
roof
and
they
gave
it
her
and
she
cut
the
coffer
out
of
it
and
fell
upon
it
and
embraced
it
and
lamented
so
loud
that
the
younger
of
the
king
s
children
died
of
fright
on
the
spot
but
the
trunk
of
the
tree
she
wrapped
in
fine
linen
and
poured
ointment
on
it
and
gave
it
to
the
king
and
queen
and
the
wood
stands
in
a
temple
of
isis
and
is
worshipped
by
the
people
of
byblus
to
this
day
and
isis
put
the
coffer
in
a
boat
and
took
the
eldest
of
the
king
s
children
with
her
and
sailed
away
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
she
opened
the
chest
and
laying
her
face
on
the
face
of
her
brother
she
kissed
him
and
wept
but
the
child
came
behind
her
softly
and
saw
what
she
was
about
and
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
in
anger
and
the
child
could
not
bear
her
look
and
died
but
some
say
that
it
was
not
so
but
that
he
fell
into
the
sea
and
was
drowned
it
is
he
whom
the
egyptians
sing
of
at
their
banquets
under
the
name
of
maneros
but
isis
put
the
coffer
by
and
went
to
see
her
son
horus
at
the
city
of
buto
and
typhon
found
the
coffer
as
he
was
hunting
a
boar
one
night
by
the
light
of
a
full
moon
and
he
knew
the
body
and
rent
it
into
fourteen
pieces
and
scattered
them
abroad
but
isis
sailed
up
and
down
the
marshes
in
a
shallop
made
of
papyrus
looking
for
the
pieces
and
that
is
why
when
people
sail
in
shallops
made
of
papyrus
the
crocodiles
do
not
hurt
them
for
they
fear
or
respect
the
goddess
and
that
is
the
reason
too
why
there
are
many
graves
of
osiris
in
egypt
for
she
buried
each
limb
as
she
found
it
but
others
will
have
it
that
she
buried
an
image
of
him
in
every
city
pretending
it
was
his
body
in
order
that
osiris
might
be
worshipped
in
many
places
and
that
if
typhon
searched
for
the
real
grave
he
might
not
be
able
to
find
it
however
the
genital
member
of
osiris
had
been
eaten
by
the
fishes
so
isis
made
an
image
of
it
instead
and
the
image
is
used
by
the
egyptians
at
their
festivals
to
this
day
isis
writes
the
historian
diodorus
siculus
recovered
all
the
parts
of
the
body
except
the
genitals
and
because
she
wished
that
her
husband
s
grave
should
be
unknown
and
honoured
by
all
who
dwell
in
the
land
of
egypt
she
resorted
to
the
following
device
she
moulded
human
images
out
of
wax
and
spices
corresponding
to
the
stature
of
osiris
round
each
one
of
the
parts
of
his
body
then
she
called
in
the
priests
according
to
their
families
and
took
an
oath
of
them
all
that
they
would
reveal
to
no
man
the
trust
she
was
about
to
repose
in
them
so
to
each
of
them
privately
she
said
that
to
them
alone
she
entrusted
the
burial
of
the
body
and
reminding
them
of
the
benefits
they
had
received
she
exhorted
them
to
bury
the
body
in
their
own
land
and
to
honour
osiris
as
a
god
she
also
besought
them
to
dedicate
one
of
the
animals
of
their
country
whichever
they
chose
and
to
honour
it
in
life
as
they
had
formerly
honoured
osiris
and
when
it
died
to
grant
it
obsequies
like
his
and
because
she
would
encourage
the
priests
in
their
own
interest
to
bestow
the
aforesaid
honours
she
gave
them
a
third
part
of
the
land
to
be
used
by
them
in
the
service
and
worship
of
the
gods
accordingly
it
is
said
that
the
priests
mindful
of
the
benefits
of
osiris
desirous
of
gratifying
the
queen
and
moved
by
the
prospect
of
gain
carried
out
all
the
injunctions
of
isis
wherefore
to
this
day
each
of
the
priests
imagines
that
osiris
is
buried
in
his
country
and
they
honour
the
beasts
that
were
consecrated
in
the
beginning
and
when
the
animals
die
the
priests
renew
at
their
burial
the
mourning
for
osiris
but
the
sacred
bulls
the
one
called
apis
and
the
other
mnevis
were
dedicated
to
osiris
and
it
was
ordained
that
they
should
be
worshipped
as
gods
in
common
by
all
the
egyptians
since
these
animals
above
all
others
had
helped
the
discoverers
of
corn
in
sowing
the
seed
and
procuring
the
universal
benefits
of
such
is
the
myth
or
legend
of
osiris
as
told
by
greek
writers
and
eked
out
by
more
or
less
fragmentary
notices
or
allusions
in
native
egyptian
literature
a
long
inscription
in
the
temple
at
denderah
has
preserved
a
list
of
the
god
s
graves
and
other
texts
mention
the
parts
of
his
body
which
were
treasured
as
holy
relics
in
each
of
the
sanctuaries
thus
his
heart
was
at
athribis
his
backbone
at
busiris
his
neck
at
letopolis
and
his
head
at
memphis
as
often
happens
in
such
cases
some
of
his
divine
limbs
were
miraculously
multiplied
his
head
for
example
was
at
abydos
as
well
as
at
memphis
and
his
legs
which
were
remarkably
numerous
would
have
sufficed
for
several
ordinary
mortals
in
this
respect
however
osiris
was
nothing
to
denys
of
whom
no
less
than
seven
heads
all
equally
genuine
are
extant
according
to
native
egyptian
accounts
which
supplement
that
of
plutarch
when
isis
had
found
the
corpse
of
her
husband
osiris
she
and
her
sister
nephthys
sat
down
beside
it
and
uttered
a
lament
which
in
after
ages
became
the
type
of
all
egyptian
lamentations
for
the
dead
come
to
thy
house
they
wailed
come
to
thy
house
o
god
on
come
to
thy
house
thou
who
hast
no
foes
o
fair
youth
come
to
thy
house
that
thou
mayest

turned
their

and
weep
for

i
call
after

and

i
thy
sister
whom
thou
didst

on
earth
thou
didst
love
none
but
me
my
brother
my
brother
this
lament
for
the
fair
youth
cut
off
in
his
prime
reminds
us
of
the
laments
for
adonis
the
title
of
unnefer
or
the
good
being
bestowed
on
him
marks
the
beneficence
which
tradition
universally
ascribed
to
osiris
it
was
at
once
his
commonest
title
and
one
of
his
names
as
king
the
lamentations
of
the
two
sad
sisters
were
not
in
vain
in
pity
for
her
sorrow
the
ra
sent
down
from
heaven
the
god
anubis
who
with
the
aid
of
isis
and
nephthys
of
thoth
and
horus
pieced
together
the
broken
body
of
the
murdered
god
swathed
it
in
linen
bandages
and
observed
all
the
other
rites
which
the
egyptians
were
wont
to
perform
over
the
bodies
of
the
departed
then
isis
fanned
the
cold
clay
with
her
wings
osiris
revived
and
thenceforth
reigned
as
king
over
the
dead
in
the
other
world
there
he
bore
the
titles
of
lord
of
the
underworld
lord
of
eternity
ruler
of
the
dead
there
too
in
the
great
hall
of
the
two
truths
assisted
by
assessors
one
from
each
of
the
principal
districts
of
egypt
he
presided
as
judge
at
the
trial
of
the
souls
of
the
departed
who
made
their
solemn
confession
before
him
and
their
heart
having
been
weighed
in
the
balance
of
justice
received
the
reward
of
virtue
in
a
life
eternal
or
the
appropriate
punishment
of
their
sins
the
confession
or
rather
profession
which
the
of
the
puts
in
the
mouth
of
the
deceased
at
the
of
osiris
sets
the
morality
of
the
ancient
egyptians
in
a
very
favourable
light
in
rendering
an
account
of
his
life
the
deceased
solemnly
protested
that
he
had
not
oppressed
his
that
he
had
made
none
to
weep
that
he
had
done
no
murder
neither
committed
fornication
nor
borne
false
witness
that
he
had
not
falsified
the
balance
that
he
had
not
taken
the
milk
from
the
mouths
of
babes
that
he
had
given
bread
to
the
hungry
and
water
to
the
thirsty
and
had
clothed
the
naked
in
harmony
with
these
professions
are
the
epitaphs
on
egyptian
graves
which
reveal
if
not
the
moral
practice
at
least
the
moral
ideals
of
those
who
slept
beneath
them
thus
for
example
a
man
says
in
his
epitaph
i
gave
bread
to
the
hungry
and
clothes
to
the
naked
and
ferried
across
in
my
own
boat
him
who
could
not
pass
the
water
i
was
a
father
to
the
orphan
a
husband
to
the
widow
a
shelter
from
the
wind
to
them
that
were
cold
i
am
one
that
spake
good
and
told
good
i
earned
my
substance
in
those
who
had
done
thus
in
their
mortal
life
and
had
been
acquitted
at
the
great
assize
were
believed
to
dwell
thenceforth
at
ease
in
a
land
where
the
corn
grew
higher
than
on
earth
where
harvests
never
failed
where
trees
were
always
green
and
wives
for
ever
young
and
fair
we
are
not
clearly
informed
as
to
the
fate
which
the
egyptians
supposed
to
befall
the
wicked
after
death
in
the
scenes
which
represent
the
last
judgment
there
is
seen
crouching
beside
the
scales
in
which
the
heart
of
the
dead
is
being
weighed
a
monstrous
animal
known
as
the
eater
of
the
it
has
the
head
of
a
crocodile
the
trunk
of
a
lion
and
the
hinder
parts
of
a
hippopotamus
some
think
that
the
souls
of
those
whose
hearts
had
been
weighed
in
the
balance
and
found
wanting
were
delivered
over
to
this
grim
monster
to
be
devoured
but
this
view
appears
to
be
conjectural
generally
the
animal
seems
to
have
been
placed
there
simply
as
guardian
of
the
entrance
to
the
fields
of
the
blessed
but
sometimes
it
is
likened
to
set
elsewhere
it
is
said
that
the
judges
of
the
dead
slay
the
wicked
and
drink
their
blood
in
brief
here
also
we
have
conflicting
statements
and
can
only
gather
that
there
seems
to
have
been
no
general
agreement
among
the
dwellers
in
the
valley
of
the
nile
as
to
the
ultimate
lot
of
the
in
the
resurrection
of
osiris
the
egyptians
saw
the
pledge
of
a
life
everlasting
for
themselves
beyond
the
grave
they
believed
that
every
man
would
live
eternally
in
the
other
world
if
only
his
surviving
friends
did
for
his
body
what
the
gods
had
done
for
the
body
of
osiris
hence
the
ceremonies
observed
by
the
egyptians
over
the
human
dead
were
an
exact
copy
of
those
which
anubis
horus
and
the
rest
had
performed
over
the
dead
god
at
every
burial
there
was
enacted
a
representation
of
the
divine
mystery
which
had
been
performed
of
old
over
osiris
when
his
son
his
sisters
his
friends
were
gathered
round
his
mangled
remains
and
succeeded
by
their
spells
and
manipulations
in
converting
his
broken
body
into
the
first
mummy
which
they
afterwards
reanimated
and
furnished
with
the
means
of
entering
on
a
new
individual
life
beyond
the
grave
the
mummy
of
the
deceased
was
osiris
the
professional
female
mourners
were
his
two
sisters
isis
and
nephthys
anubis
horus
all
the
gods
of
the
osirian
legend
gathered
about
the
in
this
solemn
drama
of
death
and
resurrection
the
principal
part
was
played
by
the
celebrant
who
represented
horus
the
son
of
the
dead
and
resuscitated
osiris
he
formally
opened
the
eyes
and
mouth
of
the
dead
man
by
rubbing
or
pretending
to
rub
them
four
times
with
the
bleeding
heart
and
thigh
of
a
sacrificed
bull
after
which
a
pretence
was
made
of
actually
opening
the
mouth
of
the
mummy
or
of
the
statue
with
certain
instruments
specially
reserved
for
the
purpose
geese
and
gazelles
were
also
sacrificed
by
being
decapitated
they
were
supposed
to
represent
the
enemies
of
osiris
who
after
the
murder
of
the
divine
man
had
sought
to
evade
the
righteous
punishment
of
their
crime
but
had
been
detected
and
beheaded
thus
every
dead
egyptian
was
identified
with
osiris
and
bore
his
name
from
the
middle
kingdom
onwards
it
was
the
regular
practice
to
address
the
deceased
as
osiris
as
if
he
were
the
god
himself
and
to
add
the
standing
epithet
true
of
speech
because
true
speech
was
characteristic
of
osiris
the
thousands
of
inscribed
and
pictured
tombs
that
have
been
opened
in
the
valley
of
the
nile
prove
that
the
mystery
of
the
resurrection
was
performed
for
the
benefit
of
every
dead
egyptian
as
osiris
died
and
rose
again
from
the
dead
so
all
men
hoped
to
arise
like
him
from
death
to
life
eternal
in
an
egyptian
text
it
is
said
of
the
departed
that
as
surely
as
osiris
lives
so
shall
he
live
also
as
surely
as
osiris
did
not
die
so
shall
he
not
die
as
surely
as
osiris
is
not
annihilated
so
shall
he
too
not
be
the
dead
man
conceived
to
be
lying
like
osiris
with
mangled
body
was
comforted
by
being
told
that
the
heavenly
goddess
nut
the
mother
of
osiris
was
coming
to
gather
up
his
poor
scattered
limbs
and
mould
them
with
her
own
hands
into
a
form
immortal
and
divine
she
gives
thee
thy
head
she
brings
thee
thy
bones
she
sets
thy
limbs
together
and
puts
thy
heart
in
thy
thus
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
was
conceived
like
that
of
osiris
not
merely
as
spiritual
but
also
as
bodily
they
possess
their
heart
they
possess
their
senses
they
possess
their
mouth
they
possess
their
feet
they
possess
their
arms
they
possess
all
their
if
we
may
trust
egyptian
legend
the
trials
and
contests
of
the
royal
house
did
not
cease
with
the
restoration
of
osiris
to
life
and
his
elevation
to
the
rank
of
presiding
deity
in
the
world
of
the
dead
when
horus
the
younger
the
son
of
osiris
and
isis
was
grown
to
man
s
estate
the
ghost
of
his
royal
and
murdered
father
appeared
to
him
and
urged
him
like
another
hamlet
to
avenge
the
foul
unnatural
murder
upon
his
wicked
uncle
thus
encouraged
the
youth
attacked
the
miscreant
the
combat
was
terrific
and
lasted
many
days
horus
lost
an
eye
in
the
conflict
and
set
suffered
a
still
more
serious
mutilation
at
last
thoth
parted
the
combatants
and
healed
their
wounds
the
eye
of
horus
he
restored
by
spitting
on
it
according
to
one
account
the
great
battle
was
fought
on
the
day
of
the
month
of
thoth
foiled
in
open
war
the
artful
uncle
now
took
the
law
of
his
virtuous
nephew
he
brought
a
suit
of
bastardy
against
horus
hoping
thus
to
rob
him
of
his
inheritance
and
to
get
possession
of
it
himself
nay
not
content
with
having
murdered
his
good
brother
the
unnatural
set
carried
his
rancour
even
beyond
the
grave
by
accusing
the
dead
osiris
of
certain
high
crimes
and
misdemeanours
the
case
was
tried
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
gods
in
the
great
hall
at
heliopolis
thoth
the
god
of
wisdom
pleaded
the
cause
of
osiris
and
the
august
judges
decided
that
the
word
of
osiris
was
moreover
they
pronounced
horus
to
be
the
son
of
his
father
so
that
prince
assumed
the
crown
and
mounted
the
throne
of
the
lamented
osiris
however
according
to
another
and
perhaps
later
version
of
the
story
the
victory
of
horus
over
his
uncle
was
by
no
means
so
decisive
and
their
struggles
ended
in
a
compromise
by
which
horus
reigned
over
the
delta
while
set
became
king
of
the
upper
valley
of
the
nile
from
near
memphis
to
the
first
cataract
be
that
as
it
may
with
the
accession
of
horus
began
for
the
egyptians
the
modern
period
of
the
world
for
on
his
throne
all
the
kings
of
egypt
sat
as
his
successors
these
legends
of
a
contest
for
the
throne
of
egypt
may
perhaps
contain
a
reminiscence
of
real
dynastical
struggles
which
attended
an
attempt
to
change
the
right
of
succession
from
the
female
to
the
male
line
for
under
a
rule
of
female
kinship
the
heir
to
the
throne
is
either
the
late
king
s
brother
or
the
son
of
the
late
king
s
sister
while
under
a
rule
of
male
kinship
the
heir
to
the
throne
is
the
late
king
s
son
in
the
legend
of
osiris
the
rival
heirs
are
set
and
horus
set
being
the
late
king
s
brother
and
horus
the
late
king
s
son
though
horus
indeed
united
both
claims
to
the
crown
being
the
son
of
the
king
s
sister
as
well
as
of
the
king
a
similar
attempt
to
shift
the
line
of
succession
seems
to
have
given
rise
to
similar
contests
at
rome
thus
according
to
what
seems
to
have
been
the
general
native
tradition
osiris
was
a
good
and
beloved
king
of
egypt
who
suffered
a
violent
death
but
rose
from
the
dead
and
was
henceforth
worshipped
as
a
deity
in
harmony
with
this
tradition
he
was
regularly
represented
by
sculptors
and
painters
in
human
and
regal
form
as
a
dead
king
swathed
in
the
wrappings
of
a
mummy
but
wearing
on
his
head
a
kingly
crown
and
grasping
in
one
of
his
hands
which
were
left
free
from
the
bandages
a
kingly
sceptre
two
cities
above
all
others
were
associated
with
his
myth
or
memory
one
of
them
was
busiris
in
lower
egypt
which
claimed
to
possess
his
backbone
the
other
was
abydos
in

the
possession

living
god
abydos
originally
an
obscure
place
became
from
the
end
of
the
old
kingdom
the
holiest
spot
in
egypt
his
tomb
there
would
seem
to
have
been
to
the
egyptians
what
the
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
at
jerusalem
is
to
christians
it
was
the
wish
of
every
pious
man
that
his
dead
body
should
rest
in
hallowed
earth
near
the
grave
of
the
glorified
osiris
few
indeed
were
rich
enough
to
enjoy
this
inestimable
privilege
for
apart
from
the
cost
of
a
tomb
in
the
sacred
city
the
mere
transport
of
mummies
from
great
distances
was
both
difficult
and
expensive
yet
so
eager
were
many
to
absorb
in
death
the
blessed
influence
which
radiated
from
the
holy
sepulchre
that
they
caused
their
surviving
friends
to
convey
their
mortal
remains
to
abydos
there
to
tarry
for
a
short
time
and
then
to
be
brought
back
by
river
and
interred
in
the
tombs
which
had
been
made
ready
for
them
in
their
native
land
others
had
cenotaphs
built
or
memorial
tablets
erected
for
themselves
near
the
tomb
of
their
dead

risen
lord
that
they
might
share
with
him
the
bliss
of
a
joyful
resurrection
hence
from
the
earliest
ages
of
egyptian
history
abydos
would
seem
to
have
been
a
city
of
the
dead
rather
than
of
the
living
certainly
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
place
was
ever
of
any
political
importance
no
less
than
nine
of
the
most
ancient
kings
of
egypt
known
to
us
were
buried
here
for
their
tombs
have
been
discovered
and
explored
within
recent
years
the
royal
necropolis
lies
on
the
edge
of
the
desert
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
temple
of
osiris
of
the
graves
the
oldest
is
that
of
king
khent
the
second
or
third
king
of
the
first
dynasty
his
reign
which
fell
somewhere
between
three
thousand
four
hundred
and
three
thousand
two
hundred
years
before
our
era
seems
to
have
marked
an
epoch
in
the
history
of
egypt
for
under
him
the
costume
the
figure
drawing
and
the
hieroglyphics
all
assumed
the
character
which
they
thenceforth
preserved
to
the
very
end
of
egyptian
nationality
later
ages
identified
him
with
osiris
in
a
more
intimate
sense
than
that
in
which
the
divine
title
was
lavished
on
every
dead
king
and
indeed
on
every
dead
man
for
his
tomb
was
actually
converted
into
the
tomb
of
osiris
and
as
such
received
in
great
profusion
the
offerings
of
the
faithful
somewhere
between
the
and
the
dynasty
a
massive
bier
of
grey
granite
was
placed
in
the
sepulchral
chamber
on
it
cut
in
high
relief
reposes
a
shrouded
figure
of
the
dead
osiris
he
lies
at
full
length
with
bare
and
upturned
face
on
his
head
is
the
white
crown
of
upper
egypt
in
his
hands
which
issue
from
the
shroud
he
holds
the
characteristic
emblems
of
the
god
the
sceptre
and
the
scourge
at
the
four
corners
of
the
bier
are
perched
four
hawks
representing
the
four
children
of
horus
each
with
their
father
s
banner
keeping
watch
over
the
dead
god
as
they
kept
watch
over
the
four
quarters
of
the
world
a
fifth
hawk
seems
to
have
been
perched
on
the
middle
of
the
body
of
osiris
but
it
had
been
broken
off
before
the
tomb
was
discovered
in
recent
years
for
only
the
bird
s
claws
remain
in
position
finely
carved
heads
of
lions
one
at
each
corner
of
the
bier
with
the
claws
to
match
below
complete
the
impressive
monument
the
scene
represented
is
unquestionably
the
impregnation
of
isis
in
the
form
of
a
hawk
by
the
dead
osiris
the
copts
who
dismantled
the
shrine
appear
to
have
vented
their
pious
rage
on
the
figure
of
the
hawk
isis
by
carrying
it
off
or
smashing
it
if
any
doubt
could
exist
as
to
the
meaning
of
these
sculptured
figures
it
would
be
set
at
rest
by
the
ancient
inscriptions
attached
to
them
over
against
the
right
shoulder
of
the
shrouded
figure
who
lies
stretched
on

bier

carved
in
hieroglyphics

words

where
the
missing

perched
on
the

of

is
carved

symbol
of

two
relics
of
the
ancient
human
occupants
of
the
tomb
escaped
alike
the
fury
of
the
fanatics
and
the
avarice
of
the
plunderers
who
pillaged
and
destroyed
it
one
of
the
relics
is
a
human
skull
from
which
the
lower
jawbone
is
missing
the
other
is
an
arm
encircled
by
gorgeous
jewelled
bracelets
of
gold
turquoises
amethysts
and
dark
purple
lapis
lazuli
the
former
may
be
the
head
of
king
khent
himself
the
latter
is
almost
certainly
the
arm
of
his
queen
one
of
the
bracelets
is
composed
of
alternate
plaques
of
gold
and
turquoise
each
ornamented
with
the
figure
of
a
hawk
perched
on
the
top
of
it
the
hawk
was
the
sacred
bird
or
crest
of
the
earliest
dynasties
of
egyptian
kings
the
figure
of
a
hawk
was
borne
before
the
king
as
a
standard
on
solemn
occasions
the
oldest
capital
of
the
country
known
to
us
was
called
there
the
kings
of
the
first
dynasty
built
a
temple
to
the
hawk
there
in
modern
times
has
been
found
a
splendid
golden
head
of
a
hawk
dating
from
the
ancient
empire
and
on
the
statue
of
king
chephren
of
the
third
dynasty
we
see
a
hawk
with
wings
protecting
the
back
of
the
monarch
s
head
from
the
earliest
to
the
latest
times
of
egyptian
civilization
the
hawk
was
the
epithet
of
the
king
of
egypt
and
of
the
king
alone
it
took
the
first
place
in
the
list
of
his
titles
the
sanctity
of
the
bird
may
help
us
to
understand
why
isis
took
the
form
of
a
hawk
in
order
to
mate
with
her
dead
husband
why
the
queen
of
egypt
wore
on
her
arm
a
bracelet
adorned
with
golden
hawks
and
why
in
the
holy
sepulchre
the
four
sons
of
horus
were
represented
in
the
likeness
of
hawks
keeping
watch
over
the
effigy
of
their
divine
grandfather
the
legend
recorded
by
plutarch
which
associated
the
dead
osiris
with
byblus
in
phoenicia
is
doubtless
late
and
probably
untrustworthy
it
may
have
been
suggested
by
the
resemblance
which
the
worship
of
the
egyptian
osiris
bore
to
the
worship
of
the
phoenician
adonis
in
that
city
but
it
is
possible
that
the
story
has
no
deeper
foundation
than
a
verbal
misunderstanding
for
byblus
is
not
only
the
name
of
a
city
it
is
the
greek
word
for
papyrus
and
as
isis
is
said
after
the
death
of
osiris
to
have
taken
refuge
in
the
papyrus
swamps
of
the
delta
where
she
gave
birth
to
and
reared
her
son
horus
a
greek
writer
may
perhaps
have
confused
the
plant
with
the
city
of
the
same
name
however
that
may
have
been
the
association
of
osiris
with
adonis
at
byblus
gave
rise
to
a
curious
tale
it
is
said
that
every
year
the
people
beyond
the
rivers
of
ethiopia
used
to
write
a
letter
to
the
women
of
byblus
informing
them
that
the
lost
and
lamented
adonis
was
found
this
letter
they
enclosed
in
an
earthen
pot
which
they
sealed
and
sent
floating
down
the
river
to
the
sea
the
waves
carried
the
pot
to
byblus
where
every
year
it
arrived
at
the
time
when
the
syrian
women
were
weeping
for
their
dead
lord
the
pot
was
taken
up
from
the
water
and
opened
the
letter
was
read
and
the
weeping
women
dried
their
tears
because
the
lost
adonis
was
found
chapter
ii
the
official
egyptian
calendar
a
useful
clue
to
the
original
nature
of
a
god
or
goddess
is
often
furnished
by
the
season
at
which
his
or
her
festival
is
celebrated
thus
if
the
festival
falls
at
the
new
or
the
full
moon
there
is
a
certain
presumption
that
the
deity
thus
honoured
either
is
the
moon
or
at
least
has
lunar
affinities
if
the
festival
is
held
at
the
winter
or
summer
solstice
we
naturally
surmise
that
the
god
is
the
sun
or
at
all
events
that
he
stands
in
some
close
relation
to
that
luminary
again
if
the
festival
coincides
with
the
time
of
sowing
or
harvest
we
are
inclined
to
infer
that
the
divinity
is
an
embodiment
of
the
earth
or
of
the
corn
these
presumptions
or
inferences
taken
by
themselves
are
by
no
means
conclusive
but
if
they
happen
to
be
confirmed
by
other
indications
the
evidence
may
be
regarded
as
fairly
strong
unfortunately
in
dealing
with
the
egyptian
gods
we
are
in
a
great
measure
precluded
from
making
use
of
this
clue
the
reason
is
not
that
the
dates
of
the
festivals
are
always
unknown
but
that
they
shifted
from
year
to
year
until
after
a
long
interval
they
had
revolved
through
the
whole
course
of
the
seasons
this
gradual
revolution
of
the
festal
egyptian
cycle
resulted
from
the
employment
of
a
calendar
year
which
neither
corresponded
exactly
to
the
solar
year
nor
was
periodically
corrected
by
intercalation
the
solar
year
is
equivalent
to
about
three
hundred
and
and
a
quarter
days
but
the
ancient
egyptians
ignoring
the
quarter
of
a
day
reckoned
the
year
at
three
hundred
and
days
only
thus
each
of
their
calendar
years
was
shorter
than
the
true
solar
year
by
about
a
quarter
of
a
day
in
four
years
the
deficiency
amounted
to
one
whole
day
in
forty
years
it
amounted
to
ten
days
in
four
hundred
years
it
amounted
to
a
hundred
days
and
so
it
went
on
increasing
until
after
a
lapse
of
four
times
three
hundred
and
or
one
thousand
four
hundred
and
sixty
solar
years
the
deficiency
amounted
to
three
hundred
and
days
or
a
whole
egyptian
year
hence
one
thousand
four
hundred
and
sixty
solar
years
or
their
equivalent
one
thousand
four
hundred
and
egyptian
years
formed
a
period
or
cycle
at
the
end
of
which
the
egyptian
festivals
returned
to
those
points
of
the
solar
year
at
which
they
had
been
celebrated
in
the
beginning
in
the
meantime
they
had
been
held
successively
on
every
day
of
the
solar
year
though
always
on
the
same
day
of
the
calendar
thus
the
official
calendar
was
completely
divorced
except
at
rare
and
long
intervals
from
what
may
be
called
the
natural
calendar
of
the
shepherd
the
husbandman
and
the
is
from
the
course
of
the
seasons
in
which
the
times
for
the
various
labours
of
tillage
and
navigation
are
marked
by
the
position
of
the
sun
in
the
sky
the
rising
or
setting
of
the
stars
the
fall
of
rain
the
growth
of
pasture
the
ripening
of
the
corn
the
blowing
of
certain
winds
and
so
forth
nowhere
perhaps
are
the
events
of
this
natural
calendar
better
marked
or
more
regular
in
their
recurrence
than
in
egypt
nowhere
accordingly
could
their
divergence
from
the
corresponding
dates
of
the
official
calendar
be
more
readily
observed
the
divergence
certainly
did
not
escape
the
notice
of
the
egyptians
themselves
and
some
of
them
apparently
attempted
successfully
to
correct
it
thus
we
are
told
that
the
theban
priests
who
particularly
excelled
in
astronomy
were
acquainted
with
the
true
length
of
the
solar
year
and
harmonized
the
calendar
with
it
by
intercalating
a
day
every
few
probably
every
four
years
but
this
scientific
improvement
was
too
deeply
opposed
to
the
religious
conservatism
of
the
egyptian
nature
to
win
general
acceptance
the
egyptians
said
geminus
a
greek
astronomer
writing
about
are
of
an
opposite
opinion
and
purpose
from
the
greeks
for
they
neither
reckon
the
years
by
the
sun
nor
the
months
and
days
by
the
moon
but
they
observe
a
peculiar
system
of
their
own
they
wish
in
fact
that
the
sacrifices
should
not
always
be
offered
to
the
gods
at
the
same
time
of
the
year
but
that
they
should
pass
through
all
the
seasons
of
the
year
so
that
the
summer
festival
should
in
time
be
celebrated
in
winter
in
autumn
and
in
spring
for
that
purpose
they
employ
a
year
of
three
hundred
and
days
composed
of
twelve
months
of
thirty
days
each
with
five
supplementary
days
added
but
they
do
not
add
the
quarter
of
a
day
for
the
reason
i
have
in
order
that
their
festivals
may
so
attached
indeed
were
the
egyptians
to
their
old
calendar
that
the
kings
at
their
consecration
were
led
by
the
priest
of
isis
at
memphis
into
the
holy
of
holies
and
there
made
to
swear
that
they
would
maintain
the
year
of
three
hundred
and
days
without
intercalation
the
practical
inconvenience
of
a
calendar
which
marked
true
time
only
once
in
about
fifteen
hundred
years
might
be
calmly
borne
by
a
submissive
oriental
race
like
the
ancient
egyptians
but
it
naturally
proved
a
to
the
less
patient
temperament
of
their
european
conquerors
accordingly
in
the
reign
of
king
ptolemy
iii
euergetes
a
decree
was
passed
that
henceforth
the
movable
egyptian
year
should
be
converted
into
a
fixed
solar
year
by
the
intercalation
of
one
day
at
the
end
of
every
four
years
in
order
that
the
seasons
may
do
their
duty
perpetually
according
to
the
present
constitution
of
the
world
and
that
it
may
not
happen
through
the
shifting
of
the
star
by
one
day
in
four
years
that
some
of
the
public
festivals
which
are
now
held
in
the
winter
should
ever
be
celebrated
in
the
summer
and
that
other
festivals
now
held
in
the
summer
should
hereafter
be
celebrated
in
the
winter
as
has
happened
before
and
must
happen
again
if
the
year
of
three
hundred
and
days
be
the
decree
was
passed
in
the
year
or
by
the
high
priests
scribes
and
other
dignitaries
of
the
egyptian
church
assembled
in
convocation
at
canopus
but
we
can
not
doubt
that
the
measure
though
it
embodied
native
egyptian
science
was
prompted
by
the
king
or
his
macedonian
advisers
this
sage
attempt
to
reform
the
erratic
calendar
was
not
permanently
successful
the
change
may
indeed
have
been
carried
out
during
the
reign
of
the
king
who
instituted
it
but
it
was
abandoned
by
the
year
at
latest
as
we
learn
from
the
celebrated
inscription
known
as
the
rosetta
stone
in
which
a
month
of
the
macedonian
calendar
is
equated
to
the
corresponding
month
of
the
movable
egyptian
year
and
the
testimony
of
geminus
which
i
have
cited
proves
that
in
the
following
century
the
festivals
were
still
revolving
in
the
old
style
the
reform
which
the
macedonian
king
had
vainly
attempted
to
impose
upon
his
people
was
accomplished
by
the
practical
romans
when
they
took
over
the
administration
of
the
country
the
expedient
by
which
they
effected
the
change
was
a
simple
one
indeed
it
was
no
other
than
that
to
which
ptolemy
euergetes
had
resorted
for
the
same
purpose
they
merely
intercalated
one
day
at
the
end
of
every
four
years
thus
equalizing
within
a
small
fraction
four
calendar
years
to
four
solar
years
henceforth
the
official
and
the
natural
calendars
were
in
practical
agreement
the
movable
egyptian
year
had
been
converted
into
the
fixed
alexandrian
year
as
it
was
called
which
agreed
with
the
julian
year
in
length
and
in
its
system
of
intercalation
though
it
differed
from
that
year
in
retaining
the
twelve
equal
egyptian
months
and
five
supplementary
days
but
while
the
new
calendar
received
the
sanction
of
law
and
regulated
the
business
of
government
the
ancient
calendar
was
too
firmly
established
in
popular
usage
to
be
at
once
displaced
accordingly
it
survived
for
ages
side
by
side
with
its
modern
rival
the
spread
of
christianity
which
required
a
fixed
year
for
the
due
observance
of
its
festivals
did
much
to
promote
the
adoption
of
the
new
alexandrian
style
and
by
the
beginning
of
the
fifth
century
the
ancient
movable
year
of
egypt
appears
to
have
been
not
only
dead
but
forgotten

fall
of
the
nile
if
the
egyptian
farmer
of
the
olden
time
could
thus
get
no
help
except
at
the
rarest
intervals
from
the
official
or
sacerdotal
calendar
he
must
have
been
compelled
to
observe
for
himself
those
natural
signals
which
marked
the
times
for
the
various
operations
of
husbandry
in
all
ages
of
which
we
possess
any
records
the
egyptians
have
been
an
agricultural
people
dependent
for
their
subsistence
on
the
growth
of
the
corn
the
cereals
which
they
cultivated
were
wheat
barley
and
apparently
sorghum
linnaeus
the
of
the
modern
fellaheen
then
as
now
the
whole
country
with
the
exception
of
a
fringe
on
the
coast
of
the
mediterranean
was
almost
rainless
and
owed
its
immense
fertility
entirely
to
the
annual
inundation
of
the
nile
which
regulated
by
an
elaborate
system
of
dams
and
canals
was
distributed
over
the
fields
renewing
the
soil
year
by
year
with
a
fresh
deposit
of
mud
washed
down
from
the
great
equatorial
lakes
and
the
mountains
of
abyssinia
hence
the
rise
of
the
river
has
always
been
watched
by
the
inhabitants
with
the
utmost
anxiety
for
if
it
either
falls
short
of
or
exceeds
a
certain
height
dearth
and
famine
are
the
inevitable
consequences
the
water
begins
to
rise
early
in
june
but
it
is
not
until
the
latter
half
of
july
that
it
swells
to
a
mighty
tide
by
the
end
of
september
the
inundation
is
at
its
greatest
height
the
country
is
now
submerged
and
presents
the
appearance
of
a
sea
of
turbid
water
from
which
the
towns
and
villages
built
on
higher
ground
rise
like
islands
for
about
a
month
the
flood
remains
nearly
stationary
then
sinks
more
and
more
rapidly
till
by
december
or
january
the
river
has
returned
to
its
ordinary
bed
with
the
approach
of
summer
the
level
of
the
water
continues
to
fall
in
the
early
days
of
june
the
nile
is
reduced
to
half
its
ordinary
breadth
and
egypt
scorched
by
the
sun
blasted
by
the
wind
that
has
blown
from
the
sahara
for
many
days
seems
a
mere
continuation
of
the
desert
the
trees
are
choked
with
a
thick
layer
of
grey
dust
a
few
meagre
patches
of
vegetables
watered
with
difficulty
struggle
painfully
for
existence
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
villages
some
appearance
of
verdure
lingers
beside
the
canals
and
in
the
hollows
from
which
the
moisture
has
not
wholly
evaporated
the
plain
appears
to
pant
in
the
pitiless
sunshine
bare
dusty
cracked
and
seamed
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see
with
a
network
of
fissures
from
the
middle
of
april
till
the
middle
of
june
the
land
of
egypt
is
but
half
alive
waiting
for
the
new
nile
for
countless
ages
this
cycle
of
natural
events
has
determined
the
annual
labours
of
the
egyptian
husbandman
the
first
work
of
the
agricultural
year
is
the
cutting
of
the
dams
which
have
hitherto
prevented
the
swollen
river
from
flooding
the
canals
and
the
fields
this
is
done
and
the
waters
released
on
their
beneficent
mission
in
the
first
half
of
august
in
november
when
the
inundation
has
subsided
wheat
barley
and
sorghum
are
sown
the
time
of
harvest
varies
with
the
district
falling
about
a
month
later
in
the
north
than
in
the
south
in
upper
or
southern
egypt
barley
is
reaped
at
the
beginning
of
march
wheat
at
the
beginning
of
april
and
sorghum
about
the
end
of
that
month
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
these
various
events
of
the
agricultural
year
were
celebrated
by
the
egyptian
farmer
with
some
simple
religious
rites
designed
to
secure
the
blessing
of
the
gods
upon
his
labours
these
rustic
ceremonies
he
would
continue
to
perform
year
after
year
at
the
same
season
while
the
solemn
festivals
of
the
priests
continued
to
shift
with
the
shifting
calendar
from
summer
through
spring
to
winter
and
so
backward
through
autumn
to
summer
the
rites
of
the
husbandman
were
stable
because
they
rested
on
direct
observation
of
nature
the
rites
of
the
priest
were
unstable
because
they
were
based
on
a
false
calculation
yet
many
of
the
priestly
festivals
may
have
been
nothing
but
the
old
rural
festivals
disguised
in
the
course
of
ages
by
the
pomp
of
sacerdotalism
and
severed
by
the
error
of
the
calendar
from
their
roots
in
the
natural
cycle
of
the
seasons
rites
of
irrigation
these
conjectures
are
confirmed
by
the
little
we
know
both
of
the
popular
and
of
the
official
egyptian
religion
thus
we
are
told
that
the
egyptians
held
a
festival
of
isis
at
the
time
when
the
nile
began
to
rise
they
believed
that
the
goddess
was
then
mourning
for
the
lost
osiris
and
that
the
tears
which
dropped
from
her
eyes
swelled
the
impetuous
tide
of
the
river
hence
in
egyptian
inscriptions
isis
is
spoken
of
as
she
who
maketh
the
nile
to
swell
and
overflow
who
maketh
the
nile
to
swell
in
his
similarly
the
toradjas
of
central
celebes
imagine
that
showers
of
rain
are
the
tears
shed
by
the
compassionate
gods
in
weeping
for
somebody
who
is
about
to
die
a
shower
in
the
morning
is
to
them
an
infallible
omen
of
death
however
an
uneasy
suspicion
would
seem
to
have
occurred
to
the
egyptians
that
perhaps
after
all
the
tears
of
the
goddess
might
not
suffice
of
themselves
to
raise
the
water
to
the
proper
level
so
in
the
time
of
rameses
ii
the
king
used
on
the
first
day
of
the
flood
to
throw
into
the
nile
a
written
order
commanding
the
river
to
do
its
duty
and
the
submissive
stream
never
failed
to
obey
the
royal
mandate
yet
the
ancient
belief
survives
in
a
modified
form
to
this
day
for
the
nile
as
we
saw
begins
to
rise
in
june
about
the
time
of
the
summer
solstice
and
the
people
still
attribute
its
increased
volume
to
a
miraculous
drop
which
falls
into
the
river
on
the
night
of
the
seventeenth
of
the
month
the
charms
and
divinations
which
they
practise
on
that
mystic
night
in
order
to
ascertain
the
length
of
their
own
life
and
to
rid
the
houses
of
bugs
may
well
date
from
a
remote
antiquity
now
if
osiris
was
in
one
of
his
aspects
a
god
of
the
corn
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
that
he
should
be
mourned
at
midsummer
for
by
that
time
the
harvest
was
past
the
fields
were
bare
the
river
ran
low
life
seemed
to
be
suspended
the
was
dead
at
such
a
moment
people
who
saw
the
handiwork
of
divine
beings
in
all
the
operations
of
nature
might
well
trace
the
swelling
of
the
sacred
stream
to
the
tears
shed
by
the
goddess
at
the
death
of
the
beneficent
her
husband
and
the
sign
of
the
rising
waters
on
earth
was
accompanied
by
a
sign
in
heaven
for
in
the
early
days
of
egyptian
history
some
three
or
four
thousand
years
before
the
beginning
of
our
era
the
splendid
star
of
sirius
the
brightest
of
all
the
fixed
stars
appeared
at
dawn
in
the
east
just
before
sunrise
about
the
time
of
the
summer
solstice
when
the
nile
begins
to
rise
the
egyptians
called
it
sothis
and
regarded
it
as
the
star
of
isis
just
as
the
babylonians
deemed
the
planet
venus
the
star
of
astarte
to
both
peoples
apparently
the
brilliant
luminary
in
the
morning
sky
seemed
the
goddess
of
life
and
love
come
to
mourn
her
departed
lover
or
spouse
and
to
wake
him
from
the
dead
hence
the
rising
of
sirius
marked
the
beginning
of
the
sacred
egyptian
year
and
was
regularly
celebrated
by
a
festival
which
did
not
shift
with
the
shifting
official
year
the
first
day
of
the
first
month
thoth
was
theoretically
supposed
to
date
from
the
heliacal
rising
of
the
bright
star
and
in
all
probability
it
really
did
so
when
the
official
or
civil
year
of
three
hundred
and
days
was
first
instituted
but
the
miscalculation
which
has
been
already
explained
had
the
effect
of
making
the
star
to
shift
its
place
in
the
calendar
by
one
day
in
four
years
thus
if
sirius
rose
on
the
first
of
thoth
in
one
year
it
would
rise
on
the
second
of
thoth
four
years
afterwards
on
the
third
of
thoth
eight
years
afterwards
and
so
on
until
after
the
lapse
of
a
siriac
or
sothic
period
of
fourteen
hundred
and
sixty
solar
years
the
first
of
thoth
again
coincided
with
the
heliacal
rising
of
sirius
this
observation
of
the
gradual
displacement
of
the
star
in
the
calendar
has
been
of
the
utmost
importance
for
the
progress
of
astronomy
since
it
led
the
egyptians
directly
to
the
determination
of
the
approximately
true
length
of
the
solar
year
and
thus
laid
the
basis
of
our
modern
calendar
for
the
julian
calendar
which
we
owe
to
caesar
was
founded
on
the
egyptian
theory
though
not
on
the
egyptian
practice
it
was
therefore
a
fortunate
moment
for
the
world
when
some
pious
egyptian
thousands
of
years
ago
identified
for
the
first
time
the
bright
star
of
sirius
with
his
goddess
for
the
identification
induced
his
countrymen
to
regard
the
heavenly
body
with
an
attention
which
they
would
never
have
paid
to
it
if
they
had
known
it
to
be
nothing
but
a
world
vastly
greater
than
our
own
and
separated
from
it
by
an
inconceivable
if
not
immeasurable
abyss
of
space
the
cutting
of
the
dams
and
the
admission
of
the
water
into
the
canals
and
fields
is
a
great
event
in
the
egyptian
year
at
cairo
the
operation
generally
takes
place
between
the
sixth
and
the
sixteenth
of
august
and
till
lately
was
attended
by
ceremonies
which
deserve
to
be
noticed
because
they
were
probably
handed
down
from
antiquity
an
ancient
canal
known
by
the
name
of
the
khalíj
formerly
passed
through
the
native
town
of
cairo
near
its
entrance
the
canal
was
crossed
by
a
dam
of
earth
very
broad
at
the
bottom
and
diminishing
in
breadth
upwards
which
used
to
be
constructed
before
or
soon
after
the
nile
began
to
rise
in
front
of
the
dam
on
the
side
of
the
river
was
reared
a
truncated
cone
of
earth
called
the
or
bride
on
the
top
of
which
a
little
maize
or
millet
was
generally
sown
this
bride
was
commonly
washed
down
by
the
rising
tide
a
week
or
a
fortnight
before
the
cutting
of
the
dam
tradition
runs
that
the
old
custom
was
to
deck
a
young
virgin
in
gay
apparel
and
throw
her
into
the
river
as
a
sacrifice
to
obtain
a
plentiful
inundation
certainly
human
sacrifices
were
offered
for
a
similar
purpose
by
the
wajagga
of
german
east
africa
down
to
recent
years
these
people
irrigate
their
fields
by
means
of
skilfully
constructed
channels
through
which
they
conduct
the
water
of
the
mountain
brooks
and
rivers
to
the
thirsty
land
they
imagine
that
the
spirits
of
their
forefathers
dwell
in
the
rocky
basins
of
these
rushing
streams
and
that
they
would
resent
the
withdrawal
of
the
water
to
irrigate
the
fields
if
compensation
were
not
offered
to
them
the
paid
to
them
consisted
of
a
child
uncircumcised
and
of
unblemished
body
who
was
decked
with
ornaments
and
bells
and
thrown
into
the
river
to
drown
before
they
ventured
to
draw
off
the
water
into
the
irrigation
channel
having
thrown
him
in
his
executioners
shewed
a
clean
pair
of
heels
because
they
expected
the
river
to
rise
in
flood
at
once
on
receipt
of
the
in
similar
circumstances
the
njamus
of
british
east
africa
sacrifice
a
sheep
before
they
let
the
water
of
the
stream
flow
into
the
ditch
or
artificial
channel
the
fat
dung
and
blood
of
the
animal
are
sprinkled
at
the
mouth
of
the
ditch
and
in
the
water
thereupon
the
dam
is
broken
down
and
the
stream
pours
into
the
ditch
the
sacrifice
may
only
be
offered
by
a
man
of
the
il
mayek
clan
and
for
two
days
afterwards
he
wears
the
skin
of
the
beast
tied
round
his
head
no
one
may
quarrel
with
this
man
while
the
water
is
irrigating
the
crops
else
the
people
believe
that
the
water
would
cease
to
flow
in
the
ditch
more
than
that
if
the
men
of
the
il
mayek
clan
were
angry
and
sulked
for
ten
days
the
water
would
dry
up
permanently
for
that
season
hence
the
il
mayek
clan
enjoys
great
consideration
in
the
tribe
since
the
crops
are
thought
to
depend
on
their
good
will
and
good
offices
ten
elders
assist
at
the
sacrifice
of
the
sheep
though
they
may
take
no
part
in
it
they
must
all
be
of
a
particular
age
and
after
the
ceremony
they
may
not
cohabit
with
their
wives
until
harvest
and
they
are
obliged
to
sleep
at
night
in
their
granaries
curiously
enough
too
while
the
water
is
irrigating
the
fields
nobody
may
kill
waterbuck
eland
oryx
zebra
rhinoceros
or
hippopotamus
anybody
caught
in
the
act
of
breaking
this
would
at
once
be
cast
out
of
the
village
whether
the
bride
who
used
to
figure
at
the
ceremony
of
cutting
the
dam
in
cairo
was
ever
a
live
woman
or
not
the
intention
of
the
practice
appears
to
have
been
to
marry
the
river
conceived
as
a
male
power
to
his
bride
the
which
was
soon
to
be
fertilized
by
his
water
the
ceremony
was
therefore
a
charm
to
ensure
the
growth
of
the
crops
as
such
it
probably
dated
in
one
form
or
another
from
ancient
times
dense
crowds
assembled
to
witness
the
cutting
of
the
dam
the
operation
was
performed
before
sunrise
and
many
people
spent
the
preceding
night
on
the
banks
of
the
canal
or
in
boats
lit
with
lamps
on
the
river
while
fireworks
were
displayed
and
guns
discharged
at
frequent
intervals
before
sunrise
a
great
number
of
workmen
began
to
cut
the
dam
and
the
task
was
accomplished
about
an
hour
before
the
sun
appeared
on
the
horizon
when
only
a
thin
ridge
of
earth
remained
a
boat
with
an
officer
on
board
was
propelled
against
it
and
breaking
through
the
slight
barrier
descended
with
the
rush
of
water
into
the
canal
the
governor
of
cairo
flung
a
purse
of
gold
into
the
boat
as
it
passed
formerly
the
custom
was
to
throw
money
into
the
canal
the
populace
used
to
dive
after
it
and
several
lives
were
generally
lost
in
the
scramble
this
practice
also
would
seem
to
have
been
ancient
for
seneca
tells
us
that
at
a
place
called
the
veins
of
the
nile
not
far
from
philae
the
priests
used
to
cast
money
and
offerings
of
gold
into
the
river
at
a
festival
which
apparently
took
place
at
the
rising
of
the
water
at
cairo
the
ceremony
came
to
an
end
in
when
the
old
canal
was
filled
up
an
electric
tramway
now
runs
over
the
spot
where
for
countless
ages
crowds
of
worshippers
or
had
annually
assembled
to
witness
the
marriage
of
the
nile
rites
of
sowing
the
next
great
operation
of
the
agricultural
year
in
egypt
is
the
sowing
of
the
seed
in
november
when
the
water
of
the
inundation
has
retreated
from
the
fields
with
the
egyptians
as
with
many
peoples
of
antiquity
the
committing
of
the
seed
to
the
earth
assumed
the
character
of
a
solemn
and
mournful
rite
on
this
subject
i
will
let
plutarch
speak
for
himself
what
he
asks
are
we
to
make
of
the
gloomy
joyless
and
mournful
sacrifices
if
it
is
wrong
either
to
omit
the
established
rites
or
to
confuse
and
disturb
our
conceptions
of
the
gods
by
absurd
suspicions
for
the
greeks
also
perform
many
rites
which
resemble
those
of
the
egyptians
and
are
observed
about
the
same
time
thus
at
the
festival
of
the
thesmophoria
in
athens
women
sit
on
the
ground
and
fast
and
the
boeotians
open
the
vaults
of
the
sorrowful
one
naming
that
festival
sorrowful
because
demeter
is
sorrowing
for
the
descent
of
the
maiden
the
month
is
the
month
of
sowing
about
the
setting
of
the
pleiades
the
egyptians
call
it
athyr
the
athenians
pyanepsion
the
boeotians
the
month
of
demeter
theopompus
informs
us
that
the
western
peoples
consider
and
call
the
winter
cronus
the
summer
aphrodite
and
the
spring
persephone
and
they
believe
that
all
things
are
brought
into
being
by
cronus
and
aphrodite
the
phrygians
imagine
that
the
god
sleeps
in
winter
and
wakes
in
summer
and
accordingly
they
celebrate
with
bacchic
rites
the
putting
him
to
bed
in
winter
and
his
awakening
in
summer
the
paphlagonians
allege
that
he
is
bound
fast
and
shut
up
in
winter
but
that
he
stirs
and
is
set
free
in
spring
and
the
season
furnishes
a
hint
that
the
sadness
is
for
the
hiding
of
those
fruits
of
the
earth
which
the
ancients
esteemed
not
indeed
gods
but
great
and
necessary
gifts
bestowed
by
the
gods
in
order
that
men
might
not
lead
the
life
of
savages
and
of
wild
beasts
for
it
was
that
time
of
year
when
they
saw
some
of
the
fruits
vanishing
and
falling
from
the
trees
while
they
sowed
others
grudgingly
and
with
difficulty
scraping
the
earth
with
their
hands
and
huddling
it
up
again
on
the
uncertain
chance
that
what
they
deposited
in
the
ground
would
ever
ripen
and
come
to
maturity
thus
they
did
in
many
respects
like
those
who
bury
and
mourn
their
dead
and
just
as
we
say
that
a
purchaser
of
plato
s
books
purchases
plato
or
that
an
actor
who
plays
the
comedies
of
menander
plays
menander
so
the
men
of
old
did
not
hesitate
to
call
the
gifts
and
products
of
the
gods
by
the
names
of
the
gods
themselves
thereby
honouring
and
glorifying
the
things
on
account
of
their
utility
but
in
after
ages
simple
folk
in
their
ignorance
applied
to
the
gods
statements
which
only
held
true
of
the
fruits
of
the
earth
and
so
they
came
not
merely
to
say
but
actually
to
believe
that
the
growth
and
decay
of
plants
on
which
they
subsisted
were
the
birth
and
the
death
of
gods
thus
they
fell
into
absurd
immoral
and
confused
ways
of
thinking
though
all
the
while
the
absurdity
of
the
fallacy
was
manifest
hence
xenophanes
of
colophon
declared
that
if
the
egyptians
deemed
their
gods
divine
they
should
not
weep
for
them
and
that
if
they
wept
for
them
they
should
not
deem
them
divine
for
it
is
ridiculous
said
he
to
lament
and
pray
that
the
fruits
would
be
good
enough
to
grow
and
ripen
again
in
order
that
they
may
again
be
eaten
and
but
he
was
wrong
for
though
the
lamentations
are
for
the
fruits
the
prayers
are
addressed
to
the
gods
as
the
causes
and
givers
of
them
that
they
would
be
pleased
to
make
fresh
fruits
to
spring
up
instead
of
those
that
in
this
interesting
passage
plutarch
expresses
his
belief
that
the
worship
of
the
fruits
of
the
earth
was
the
result
of
a
verbal
misapprehension
or
disease
of
language
as
it
has
been
called
by
a
modern
school
of
mythologists
who
explain
the
origin
of
myths
in
general
on
the
same
easy
principle
of
metaphors
misunderstood
primitive
man
on
plutarch
s
theory
firmly
believed
that
the
fruits
of
the
earth
on
which
he
subsisted
were
not
themselves
gods
but
merely
the
gifts
of
the
gods
who
were
the
real
givers
of
all
good
things
yet
at
the
same
time
men
were
in
the
habit
of
bestowing
on
these
divine
products
the
names
of
their
divine
creators
either
out
of
gratitude
or
merely
for
the
sake
of
brevity
as
when
we
say
that
a
man
has
bought
a
shakespeare
or
acted
molière
when
we
mean
that
he
has
bought
the
works
of
shakespeare
or
acted
the
plays
of
molière
this
abbreviated
mode
of
expression
was
misunderstood
in
later
times
and
so
people
came
to
look
upon
the
fruits
of
the
earth
as
themselves
divine
instead
of
as
being
the
work
of
divinities
in
short
they
mistook
the
creature
for
the
creator
in
like
manner
plutarch
would
explain
the
egyptian
worship
of
animals
as
reverence
done
not
so
much
to
the
beasts
themselves
as
to
the
great
god
who
displays
the
divine
handiwork
in
sentient
organisms
even
more
than
in
the
most
beautiful
and
wonderful
works
of
inanimate
nature
the
comparative
study
of
religion
has
proved
that
these
theories
of
plutarch
are
an
inversion
of
the
truth
fetishism
or
the
view
that
the
fruits
of
the
earth
and
things
in
general
are
divine
or
animated
by
powerful
spirits
is
not
as
plutarch
imagined
a
late
corruption
of
a
pure
and
primitive
theism
which
regarded
the
gods
as
the
creators
and
givers
of
all
good
things
on
the
contrary
fetishism
is
early
and
theism
is
late
in
the
history
of
mankind
in
this
respect
xenophanes
whom
plutarch
attempts
to
correct
displayed
a
much
truer
insight
into
the
mind
of
the
savage
to
weep
crocodile
tears
over
the
animals
and
plants
which
he
kills
and
eats
and
to
pray
them
to
come
again
in
order
that
they
may
be
again
eaten
and
again
may
seem
absurd
to
us
but
it
is
precisely
what
the
savage
does
and
from
his
point
of
view
the
proceeding
is
not
at
all
absurd
but
perfectly
rational
and
well
calculated
to
answer
his
ends
for
he
sincerely
believes
that
animals
and
fruits
are
tenanted
by
spirits
who
can
harm
him
if
they
please
and
who
can
not
but
be
put
to
considerable
inconvenience
by
that
destruction
of
their
bodies
which
is
unfortunately
inseparable
from
the
processes
of
mastication
and
digestion
what
more
natural
therefore
than
that
the
savage
should
offer
excuses
to
the
beasts
and
the
fruits
for
the
painful
necessity
he
is
under
of
consuming
them
and
that
he
should
endeavour
to
alleviate
their
pangs
by
soft
words
and
an
air
of
respectful
sympathy
in
order
that
they
may
bear
him
no
grudge
and
may
in
due
time
come
again
to
be
again
eaten
and
again
lamented
judged
by
the
standard
of
primitive
manners
the
attitude
of
the
walrus
to
the
oysters
was
strictly
correct
weep
for
you
the
walrus
said
deeply
sobs
and
tears
he
sorted
of
the
largest
size
his
his
streaming
many
examples
of
such
hypocritical
lamentations
for
animals
drawn
not
from
the
fancy
of
a
playful
writer
but
from
the
facts
of
savage
life
could
be
cited
here
i
shall
quote
the
general
statement
of
a
writer
on
the
indians
of
british
columbia
because
it
covers
the
case
of
vegetable
as
well
as
of
animal
food
after
describing
the
respectful
welcome
accorded
by
the
stlatlum
indians
to
the
first
salmon
which
they
have
caught
in
the
season
he
goes
on
the
significance
of
these
ceremonies
is
easy
to
perceive
when
we
remember
the
attitude
of
the
indians
towards
nature
generally
and
recall
their
myths
relating
to
the
salmon
and
their
coming
to
their
rivers
and
streams
nothing
that
the
indian
of
this
region
eats
is
regarded
by
him
as
mere
food
and
nothing
more
not
a
single
plant
animal
or
fish
or
other
object
upon
which
he
feeds
is
looked
upon
in
this
light
or
as
something
he
has
secured
for
himself
by
his
own
wit
and
skill
he
regards
it
rather
as
something
which
has
been
voluntarily
and
compassionately
placed
in
his
hands
by
the
goodwill
and
consent
of
the
spirit
of
the
object
itself
or
by
the
intercession
and
magic
of
his
to
be
retained
and
used
by
him
only
upon
the
fulfilment
of
certain
conditions
these
conditions
include
respect
and
reverent
care
in
the
killing
or
plucking
of
the
animal
or
plant
and
proper
treatment
of
the
parts
he
has
no
use
for
such
as
the
bones
blood
and
offal
and
the
depositing
of
the
same
in
some
stream
or
lake
so
that
the
object
may
by
that
means
renew
its
life
and
physical
form
the
practices
in
connection
with
the
killing
of
animals
and
the
gathering
of
plants
and
fruits
all
make
this
quite
clear
and
it
is
only
when
we
bear
this
attitude
of
the
savage
towards
nature
in
mind
that
we
can
hope
to
rightly
understand
the
motives
and
purposes
of
many
of
his
strange
customs
and
we
can
now
understand
why
among
many
peoples
of
antiquity
as
plutarch
tells
us
the
time
of
sowing
was
a
time
of
sorrow
the
laying
of
the
seed
in
the
earth
was
a
burial
of
the
divine
element
and
it
was
fitting
that
like
a
human
burial
it
should
be
performed
with
gravity
and
the
semblance
if
not
the
reality
of
sorrow
yet
they
sorrowed
not
without
hope
perhaps
a
sure
and
certain
hope
that
the
seed
which
they
thus
committed
with
sighs
and
tears
to
the
ground
would
yet
rise
from
the
dust
and
yield
fruit
a
hundredfold
to
the
reaper
they
that
sow
in
tears
shall
reap
in
joy
he
that
goeth
forth
and
weepeth
bearing
precious
seed
shall
doubtless
come
again
with
rejoicing
bringing
his
sheaves
with
rites
of
harvest
the
egyptian
harvest
as
we
have
seen
falls
not
in
autumn
but
in
spring
in
the
months
of
march
april
and
may
to
the
husbandman
the
time
of
harvest
at
least
in
a
good
year
must
necessarily
be
a
season
of
joy
in
bringing
home
his
sheaves
he
is
requited
for
his
long
and
anxious
labours
yet
if
the
old
egyptian
farmer
felt
a
secret
joy
at
reaping
and
garnering
the
grain
it
was
essential
that
he
should
conceal
the
natural
emotion
under
an
air
of
profound
dejection
for
was
he
not
severing
the
body
of
the
with
his
sickle
and
trampling
it
to
pieces
under
the
hoofs
of
his
cattle
on
the
accordingly
we
are
told
that
it
was
an
ancient
custom
of
the
egyptian
to
beat
their
breasts
and
lament
over
the
first
sheaf
cut
while
at
the
same
time
they
called
upon
isis
the
invocation
seems
to
have
taken
the
form
of
a
melancholy
chant
to
which
the
greeks
gave
the
name
of
maneros
similar
plaintive
strains
were
chanted
by
in
phoenicia
and
other
parts
of
western
asia
probably
all
these
doleful
ditties
were
lamentations
for
the
killed
by
the
sickles
of
the
reapers
in
egypt
the
slain
deity
was
osiris
and
the
name
applied
to
the
dirge
appears
to
be
derived
from
certain
words
meaning
come
to
thy
house
which
often
occur
in
the
lamentations
for
the
dead
god
ceremonies
of
the
same
sort
have
been
observed
by
other
peoples
probably
for
the
same
purpose
thus
we
are
told
that
among
all
vegetables
corn
by
which
is
apparently
meant
maize
holds
the
first
place
in
the
household
economy
and
the
ceremonial
observance
of
the
cherokee
indians
who
invoke
it
under
the
name
of
the
old
woman
in
allusion
to
a
myth
that
it
sprang
from
the
blood
of
an
old
woman
killed
by
her
disobedient
sons
much
ceremony
accompanied
the
planting
and
tending
of
the
crop
seven
grains
the
sacred
number
were
put
into
each
hill
and
these
were
not
afterwards
thinned
out
after
the
last
working
of
the
crop
the
priest
and
an
the
owner
of
the
into
the
field
and
built
a
small
enclosure
in
the
centre
then
entering
it
they
seated
themselves
upon
the
ground
with
heads
bent
down
and
while
the
assistant
kept
perfect
silence
the
priest
with
rattle
in
hand
sang
songs
of
invocation
to
the
spirit
of
the
corn
soon
according
to
the
orthodox
belief
a
loud
rustling
would
be
heard
outside
which
they
would
know
was
caused
by
the
old
woman
bringing
the
corn
into
the
field
but
neither
must
look
up
until
the
song
was
finished
this
ceremony
was
repeated
on
four
successive
nights
after
which
no
one
entered
the
field
for
seven
other
nights
when
the
priest
himself
went
in
and
if
all
the
sacred
regulations
had
been
properly
observed
was
rewarded
by
finding
young
ears
upon
the
stalks
the
corn
ceremonies
could
be
performed
by
the
owner
of
the
field
himself
provided
he
was
willing
to
pay
a
sufficient
fee
to
the
priest
in
order
to
learn
the
songs
and
ritual
care
was
always
taken
to
keep
a
clean
trail
from
the
field
to
the
house
so
that
the
corn
might
be
encouraged
to
stay
at
home
and
not
go
wandering
elsewhere
most
of
these
customs
have
now
fallen
into
disuse
excepting
among
the
old
people
by
many
of
whom
they
are
still
religiously
observed
another
curious
ceremony
of
which
even
the
memory
is
now
almost
forgotten
was
enacted
after
the
first
working
of
the
corn
when
the
owner
or
priest
stood
in
succession
at
each
of
the
four
corners
of
the
field
and
wept
and
wailed
loudly
even
the
priests
are
now
unable
to
give
a
reason
for
this
performance
which
may
have
been
a
lament
for
the
bloody
death
of
selu
the
old
woman
of
the
corn
in
these
cherokee
practices
the
lamentations
and
the
invocations
of
the
old
woman
of
the
corn
resemble
the
ancient
egyptian
customs
of
lamenting
over
the
first
corn
cut
and
calling
upon
isis
herself
probably
in
one
of
her
aspects
an
old
woman
of
the
corn
further
the
cherokee
precaution
of
leaving
a
clear
path
from
the
field
to
the
house
resembles
the
egyptian
invitation
to
osiris
come
to
thy
so
in
the
east
indies
to
this
day
people
observe
elaborate
ceremonies
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
back
the
soul
of
the
rice
from
the
fields
to
the
barn
the
nandi
of
british
east
africa
perform
a
ceremony
in
september
when
the
eleusine
grain
is
ripening
every
woman
who
owns
a
plantation
goes
out
with
her
daughters
into
the
cornfields
and
makes
a
bonfire
of
the
branches
and
leaves
of
certain
trees
the
and
after
that
they
pluck
some
of
the
eleusine
and
each
of
them
puts
one
grain
in
her
necklace
chews
another
and
rubs
it
on
her
forehead
throat
and
breast
no
joy
is
shown
by
the
womenfolk
on
this
occasion
and
they
sorrowfully
cut
a
basketful
of
the
corn
which
they
take
home
with
them
and
place
in
the
loft
to
just
as
the
egyptians
lamented
at
cutting
the
corn
so
the
karok
indians
of
california
lament
at
hewing
the
sacred
wood
for
the
fire
in
the
the
wood
must
be
cut
from
a
tree
on
the
top
of
the
highest
hill
in
lopping
off
the
boughs
the
indian
weeps
and
sobs
piteously
shedding
real
tears
and
at
the
top
of
the
tree
he
leaves
two
branches
and
a
resembling
a
man
s
head
and
outstretched
arms
having
descended
from
the
tree
he
binds
the
wood
in
a
faggot
and
carries
it
back
to
the
blubbering
all
the
way
if
he
is
asked
why
he
thus
weeps
at
cutting
and
fetching
the
sacred
fuel
he
will
either
give
no
answer
or
say
simply
that
he
does
it
for
luck
we
may
suspect
that
his
real
motive
is
to
appease
the
wrath
of
the
many
of
whose
limbs
he
has
amputated
though
he
took
care
to
leave
him
two
arms
and
a
head
the
conception
of
the
as
old
and
dead
at
harvest
is
very
clearly
embodied
in
a
custom
observed
by
the
arabs
of
moab
when
the
harvesters
have
nearly
finished
their
task
and
only
a
small
corner
of
the
field
remains
to
be
reaped
the
owner
takes
a
handful
of
wheat
tied
up
in
a
sheaf
a
hole
is
dug
in
the
form
of
a
grave
and
two
stones
are
set
upright
one
at
the
head
and
the
other
at
the
foot
just
as
in
an
ordinary
burial
then
the
sheaf
of
wheat
is
laid
at
the
bottom
of
the
grave
and
the
sheikh
pronounces
these
words
the
old
man
is
earth
is
afterwards
thrown
in
to
cover
the
sheaf
with
a
prayer
may
allah
bring
us
back
the
wheat
of
the
chapter
iv
the
official
festivals
of
osiris
the
festival
at
sais
such
then
were
the
principal
events
of
the
farmer
s
calendar
in
ancient
egypt
and
such
the
simple
religious
rites
by
which
he
celebrated
them
but
we
have
still
to
consider
the
osirian
festivals
of
the
official
calendar
so
far
as
these
are
described
by
greek
writers
or
recorded
on
the
monuments
in
examining
them
it
is
necessary
to
bear
in
mind
that
on
account
of
the
movable
year
of
the
old
egyptian
calendar
the
true
or
astronomical
dates
of
the
official
festivals
must
have
varied
from
year
to
year
at
least
until
the
adoption
of
the
fixed
alexandrian
year
in
from
that
time
onward
apparently
the
dates
of
the
festivals
were
determined
by
the
new
calendar
and
so
ceased
to
rotate
throughout
the
length
of
the
solar
year
at
all
events
plutarch
writing
about
the
end
of
the
first
century
implies
that
they
were
then
fixed
not
movable
for
though
he
does
not
mention
the
alexandrian
calendar
he
clearly
dates
the
festivals
by
it
moreover
the
long
festal
calendar
of
esne
an
important
document
of
the
imperial
age
is
obviously
based
on
the
fixed
alexandrian
year
for
it
assigns
the
mark
for
new
year
s
day
to
the
day
which
corresponds
to
the
of
august
which
was
the
first
day
of
the
alexandrian
year
and
its
references
to
the
rising
of
the
nile
the
position
of
the
sun
and
the
operations
of
agriculture
are
all
in
harmony
with
this
supposition
thus
we
may
take
it
as
fairly
certain
that
from
onwards
the
egyptian
festivals
were
stationary
in
the
solar
year
herodotus
tells
us
that
the
grave
of
osiris
was
at
sais
in
lower
egypt
and
that
there
was
a
lake
there
upon
which
the
sufferings
of
the
god
were
displayed
as
a
mystery
by
night
this
commemoration
of
the
divine
passion
was
held
once
a
year
the
people
mourned
and
beat
their
breasts
at
it
to
testify
their
sorrow
for
the
death
of
the
god
and
an
image
of
a
cow
made
of
gilt
wood
with
a
golden
sun
between
its
horns
was
carried
out
of
the
chamber
in
which
it
stood
the
rest
of
the
year
the
cow
no
doubt
represented
isis
herself
for
cows
were
sacred
to
her
and
she
was
regularly
depicted
with
the
horns
of
a
cow
on
her
head
or
even
as
a
woman
with
the
head
of
a
cow
it
is
probable
that
the
carrying
out
of
her
image
symbolized
the
goddess
searching
for
the
dead
body
of
osiris
for
this
was
the
native
egyptian
interpretation
of
a
similar
ceremony
observed
in
plutarch
s
time
about
the
winter
solstice
when
the
gilt
cow
was
carried
seven
times
round
the
temple
a
great
feature
of
the
festival
was
the
nocturnal
illumination
people
fastened
rows
of
to
the
outside
of
their
houses
and
the
lamps
burned
all
night
long
the
custom
was
not
confined
to
sais
but
was
observed
throughout
the
whole
of
egypt
this
universal
illumination
of
the
houses
on
one
night
of
the
year
suggests
that
the
festival
may
have
been
a
commemoration
not
merely
of
the
dead
osiris
but
of
the
dead
in
general
in
other
words
that
it
may
have
been
a
night
of
all
souls
for
it
is
a
widespread
belief
that
the
souls
of
the
dead
revisit
their
old
homes
on
one
night
of
the
year
and
on
that
solemn
occasion
people
prepare
for
the
reception
of
the
ghosts
by
laying
out
food
for
them
to
eat
and
lighting
lamps
to
guide
them
on
their
dark
road
from
and
to
the
grave
the
following
instances
will
illustrate
the
custom
feasts
of
all
souls
the
esquimaux
of
michael
and
the
lower
yukon
river
in
alaska
hold
a
festival
of
the
dead
every
year
at
the
end
of
november
or
the
beginning
of
december
as
well
as
a
greater
festival
at
intervals
of
several
years
at
these
seasons
food
drink
and
clothes
are
provided
for
the
returning
ghosts
in
the
or
clubhouse
of
the
village
which
is
illuminated
with
oil
lamps
every
man
or
woman
who
wishes
to
honour
a
dead
friend
sets
up
a
lamp
on
a
stand
in
front
of
the
place
which
the
deceased
used
to
occupy
in
the
clubhouse
these
lamps
filled
with
seal
oil
are
kept
burning
day
and
night
till
the
festival
is
over
they
are
believed
to
light
the
shades
on
their
return
to
their
old
home
and
back
again
to
the
land
of
the
dead
if
any
one
fails
to
put
up
a
lamp
in
the
clubhouse
and
to
keep
it
burning
the
shade
whom
he
or
she
desires
to
honour
could
not
find
its
way
to
the
place
and
so
would
miss
the
feast
on
the
eve
of
the
festival
the
nearest
male
relation
goes
to
the
grave
and
summons
the
ghost
by
planting
there
a
small
model
of
a
seal
spear
or
of
a
wooden
dish
according
as
the
deceased
was
a
man
or
a
woman
the
badges
of
the
dead
are
marked
on
these
implements
when
all
is
ready
the
ghosts
gather
in
the
under
the
clubhouse
and
ascending
through
the
floor
at
the
proper
moment
take
possession
of
the
bodies
of
their
namesakes
to
whom
the
offerings
of
food
drink
and
clothing
are
made
for
the
benefit
of
the
dead
thus
each
shade
obtains
the
supplies
he
needs
in
the
other
world
the
dead
who
have
none
to
make
offerings
to
them
are
believed
to
suffer
great
destitution
hence
the
esquimaux
fear
to
die
without
leaving
behind
them
some
one
who
will
sacrifice
to
their
spirits
and
childless
people
generally
adopt
children
lest
their
shades
should
be
forgotten
at
the
festivals
when
a
person
has
been
much
disliked
his
ghost
is
sometimes
purposely
ignored
and
that
is
deemed
the
severest
punishment
that
could
be
inflicted
upon
him
after
the
songs
of
invitation
to
the
dead
have
been
sung
the
givers
of
the
feast
take
a
small
portion
of
food
from
every
dish
and
cast
it
down
as
an
offering
to
the
shades
then
each
pours
a
little
water
on
the
floor
so
that
it
runs
through
the
cracks
in
this
way
they
believe
that
the
spiritual
essence
of
all
the
food
and
water
is
conveyed
to
the
souls
the
remainder
of
the
food
is
afterwards
distributed
among
the
people
present
who
eat
of
it
heartily
then
with
songs
and
dances
the
feast
comes
to
an
end
and
the
ghosts
are
dismissed
to
their
own
place
dances
form
a
conspicuous
feature
of
the
great
festival
of
the
dead
which
is
held
every
few
years
the
dancers
dance
not
only
in
the
clubhouse
but
also
at
the
graves
and
on
the
ice
if
the
deceased
met
their
death
by
drowning
the
indians
of
california
used
to
observe
annual
ceremonies
of
mourning
for
the
dead
at
some
of
which
the
souls
of
the
departed
were
represented
by
living
persons
ten
or
more
men
would
prepare
themselves
to
play
the
part
of
the
ghosts
by
fasting
for
several
days
especially
by
abstaining
from
flesh
disguised
with
paint
and
soot
adorned
with
feathers
and
grasses
they
danced
and
sang
in
the
village
or
rushed
about
in
the
forest
by
night
with
burning
torches
in
their
hands
after
a
time
they
presented
themselves
to
the
relations
of
the
deceased
who
looked
upon
these
maskers
as
in
very
truth
their
departed
friends
and
received
them
accordingly
with
an
outburst
of
lamentation
the
old
women
scratching
their
own
faces
and
smiting
their
breasts
with
stones
in
token
of
mourning
these
masquerades
were
generally
held
in
february
during
their
continuance
a
strict
fast
was
observed
in
the
village
among
the
konkaus
of
california
the
dance
of
the
dead
is
always
held
about
the
end
of
august
and
marks
their
new
year
s
day
they
collect
a
large
quantity
of
food
clothing
baskets
ornaments
and
whatever
else
the
spirits
are
supposed
to
need
in
the
other
world
these
they
hang
on
a
semicircle
of
boughs
or
small
trees
cut
and
set
in
the
ground
leafless
in
the
centre
burns
a
great
fire
and
hard
by
are
the
graves
the
ceremony
begins
at
evening
and
lasts
till
daybreak
as
darkness
falls
men
and
women
sit
on
the
graves
and
wail
for
the
dead
of
the
year
then
they
dance
round
the
fire
with
frenzied
yells
and
whoops
casting
from
time
to
time
the
offerings
into
the
flames
all
must
be
consumed
before
the
first
faint
streaks
of
dawn
glimmer
in
the
east
the
choctaws
used
to
have
a
great
respect
for
their
dead
they
did
not
bury
their
bodies
but
laid
them
on
biers
made
of
bark
and
supported
by
forked
sticks
about
fifteen
feet
high
when
the
worms
had
consumed
the
flesh
the
skeleton
was
dismembered
any
remains
of
muscles
and
sinews
were
buried
and
the
bones
were
deposited
in
a
box
the
skull
being
reddened
with
ochre
the
box
containing
the
bones
was
then
carried
to
the
common
burial
ground
in
the
early
days
of
november
the
tribe
celebrated
a
great
festival
which
they
called
the
festival
of
the
dead
or
of
the
souls
every
family
then
gathered
in
the
common
burial
ground
and
there
with
weeping
and
lamentation
visited
the
boxes
which
contained
the
mouldering
relics
of
their
dead
on
returning
from
the
graveyard
they
held
a
great
banquet
which
ended
the
festival
some
of
the
pueblo
indians
of
new
mexico
believe
that
on
a
certain
day
in
august
i
think
the
dead
rise
from
their
graves
and
flit
about
the
neighbouring
hills
and
on
that
day
all
who
have
lost
friends
carry
out
quantities
of
corn
bread
meat
and
such
other
good
things
of
this
life
as
they
can
obtain
and
place
them
in
the
haunts
frequented
by
the
dead
in
order
that
the
departed
spirits
may
once
more
enjoy
the
comforts
of
this
nether
world
they
have
been
encouraged
in
this
belief
by
the
priests
who
were
in
the
habit
of
sending
out
and
appropriating
to
themselves
all
these
things
and
then
making
the
poor
simple
indians

that
the
dead
had
eaten

miztecs
of
mexico
believed
that
the
souls
of
the
dead
came
back

twelfth
month
of
every
year
which
corresponded
to
our
november
on
this
day
of
all
souls
the
houses
were
decked
out
to
welcome
the
spirits
jars
of
food
and
drink
were
set
on
a
table
in
the
principal
room
and
the
family
went
forth
with
torches
to
meet
the
ghosts
and
invite
them
to
enter
then
returning
themselves
to
the
house
they
knelt
around
the
table
and
with
eyes
bent
on
the
ground
prayed
the
souls
to
accept
of
the
offerings
and
to
procure
the
blessings
of
the
gods
upon
the
family
thus
they
remained
on
bended
knees
and
with
downcast
eyes
till
the
morning
not
daring
to
look
at
the
table
lest
they
should
offend
the
spirits
by
spying
on
them
at
their
meal
with
the
first
beams
of
the
sun
they
rose
glad
at
heart
the
jars
of
food
which
had
been
presented
to
the
dead
were
given
to
the
poor
or
deposited
in

of
the
village
and
at
a
given
moment
all
the
people
repair
to
them
and
raise
a
loud
weeping
and
wailing

after
indulging
for
a
short
time

song
to

and

at

it

after

all
who

since
the

feast
was
held
and
have
not

been
honoured
by
such
a

are
remembered
at

service
the
preparations
last
many
weeks
food
and
drink
and
all

are

in
plenty
and
the
whole
neighbourhood
for
miles
round
is
invited
to
attend
on
the
eve
of
the
feast
the
women
take
bamboo
splints
and
fashion
out
of
them
little
models
of
various
useful
articles
and
these
models
are
hung
over
the

for
the
use

and
if
it

for
whom
the
rite
is
performed
toys
of
various
kinds
will
be
made
ready
for

finally
to
stay
the
appetite
of
ghosts
who
may
be
too
to
wait
for
the
formal
banquet
in
the
house
a
supply
of
victuals
is
very
considerately
placed
outside
the
house

may
fall
to

from
the

travel
by

necessarily
follows
that

ghosts
do
so
likewise
the

in
which
the
ghostly
visitors
voyage
to

land
of
the
living
is
not
much
to
look
at
being
in
appearance
nothing
but
a
tiny
boat
made
out
of
a
bamboo
which
has
been
used
to
cook
rice
even
this
is
not
set
floating
on
the
river
but
is
simply
thrown
away
under
the
house
yet
through
the
incantations
uttered
by
the
professional
the
bark
is
wafted
away
to
the
spirit
world
and
is
there
converted
into
a
large
gladly
the
ghosts
embark
and
sail
away
as
soon
as
the
final
summons
comes
it
always
comes
in
the
evening
for
it
is
then
that
the
wailer
begins
to
croon
her
mournful
ditties
but
the
way
is
so
long
that
the
spirits
do
not
arrive
in
the
house
till
the
day
is
breaking
to
refresh
them
after
their
weary
journey
a
bamboo
full
of
awaits
them
and
this
they
partake
of
by
deputy
for
a
brave
old
man
who
does
not
fear
the
face
of
ghosts
quaffs
the
beverage
in
their
stead
amid
the
joyful
shouts
of
the
spectators
on
the
morning
after
the
feast
the
living
pay
the
last
offices
of
respect
to
the
dead
monuments
made
of
ironwood
the
little
bamboo
articles
and
food
of
all
kinds
are
set
upon
the
graves
in
consideration
of
these
gifts
the
ghosts
now
relinquish
all
claims
on
their
surviving
relatives
and
henceforth
earn
their
own
living
by
the
sweat
of
their
brow
before
they
take
their
final
departure
they
come
to
eat
and
drink
in
the
house
for
the
last
time
thus
the
dyak
festival
of
the
dead
is
not
an
annual
welcome
accorded
to
all
the
souls
of
ancestors
it
is
a
propitiatory
ceremony
designed
to
secure
once
for
all
the
eternal
welfare
of
the
recently
departed
or
at
least
to
prevent
their
ghosts
from
returning
to
infest
and
importune
the
living
the
same
is
perhaps
the
intention
of
the
soul
departure
festival
which
the
tangkul
nagas
of
manipur
in
assam
celebrate
every
year
about
the
end
of
january
at
this
great
feast
the
dead
are
represented
by
living
men
chosen
on
the
ground
of
their
likeness
to
the
departed
who
are
decked
with
ornaments
and
treated
as
if
they
were
in
truth
the
deceased
persons
come
to
life
again
in
that
character
they
dance
together
in
the
large
open
space
of
the
village
they
are
fed
by
the
female
relations
and
they
go
from
house
to
house
receiving
presents
of
cloth
the
festival
lasts
ten
days
but
the
great
day
is
the
ninth
huge
torches
of
pinewood
are
made
ready
to
be
used
that
evening
when
darkness
has
fallen
the
time
of
departure
of
the
dead
is
at
hand
their
living
representatives
are
treated
to
a
last
meal
in
the
houses
and
they
distribute
farewell
presents
to
the
sorrowing
kinsfolk
who
have
come
to
bid
them
when
the
sun
has
set
a
procession
is
formed
at
the
head
of
it
march
men
holding
aloft
the
flaring
sputtering
torches
then
follow
the
elders
armed
and
in
martial
array
and
behind
them
stalk
the
representatives
of
the
dead
with
the
relations
of
the
departed
crowding
and
trooping
about
them
slowly
and
mournfully
the
sad
procession
moves
with
loud
lamentations
through
the
darkness
to
a
spot
at
the
north
end
of
the
village
which
is
overshadowed
by
a
great
tree
the
light
of
the
torches
is
to
guide
the
souls
of
the
dead
to
their
place
of
rest
the
warlike
array
of
the
elders
is
to
guard
them
from
the
perils
and
dangers
of
the
way
at
the
village
boundary
the
procession
stops
and
the
throw
down
their
torches
at
the
same
moment
the
spirits
of
the
dead
are
believed
to
pass
into
the
dying
flambeaux
and
in
that
guise
to
depart
to
the
far
country
there
is
therefore
no
further
need
for
their
living
representatives
who
are
accordingly
stripped
of
all
their
finery
on
the
spot
when
the
people
return
home
each
family
is
careful
to
light
a
pine
torch
and
set
it
burning
on
a
stone
in
the
house
just
inside
the
front
door
this
they
do
as
a
precaution
to
prevent
their
own
souls
from
following
the
spirits
of
the
dead
to
the
other
world
the
expense
of
thus
despatching
the
dead
to
their
long
home
is
very
great
when
the
head
of
a
family
dies
debts
may
be
incurred
and
and
houses
sold
to
defray
the
cost
of
carriage
thus
the
living
impoverish
themselves
in
order
to
enrich
the
dead
the
oraons
or
uraons
of
bengal
feast
their
dead
every
year
on
a
day
in
january
this
ceremony
is
called
the
great
marriage
because
by
it
the
bones
of
the
deceased
are
believed
to
be
mysteriously
reunited
to
each
other
the
oraons
treat
the
bones
of
the
dead
differently
according
to
the
dates
of
their
death
in
the
agricultural
year
the
bones
of
those
who
died
before
the
seeds
have
sprouted
in
the
fields
are
burnt
and
the
few
charred
bones
which
have
not
been
reduced
to
ashes
are
gathered
in
an
earthen
pot
with
the
bones
in
the
pot
are
placed
offerings
of
rice
native
gin
and
money
and
then
they
carry
the
urn
to
the
river
where
the
bones
of
their
forefathers
repose
but
the
bones
of
all
who
die
after
the
seeds
have
sprung
up
and
before
the
end
of
harvest
may
not
be
taken
to
the
river
because
the
people
believe
that
were
that
to
be
done
the
crops
would
suffer
these
bones
are
therefore
put
away
in
a
pot
under
a
stone
near
the
house
till
the
harvest
is
over
then
on
the
appointed
day
in
january
they
are
all
collected
a
banquet
is
given
in
honour
of
the
dead
and
then
both
men
and
women
form
a
procession
to
accompany
the
bones
to
their
last
in
the
sands
of
the
river
but
first
the
relics
of
mortality
are
carried
from
house
to
house
in
the
village
and
each
family
pours
rice
and
gin
into
the
urn
which
contains
the
bones
of
its
dead
then
the
procession
sets
out
for
the
river
men
and
women
dancing
singing
beating
drums
and
weeping
while
the
earthen
pots
containing
the
bones
are
passed
from
hand
to
hand
and
dance
with
the
jigging
steps
of
the
dancers
when
they
are
yet
some
way
from
the
spot
the
bearers
of
the
urns
run
forward
and
bury
them
in
the
sand
of
the
river
when
the
rest
come
up
they
all
bathe
and
the
great
marriage
is
over
in
the
bilaspore
district
of
the
central
provinces
india
the
festival
known
as
the
fortnight
of
the
about
september
it
is
believed
that
during
this
fortnight
it
is
the
practice
of
all
the
departed
to
come
and
visit
their
relatives
the
homes
are
therefore
cleaned
and
the
spaces
in
front
of
the
house
are
plastered
and
painted
in
order
to
be
pleasing
to
those
who
are
expected
it
is
believed
that
the
departed
will
return
on
the
very
date
on
which
they
went
away
a
father
who
left
on
the
fourth
be
it
the
fourth
of
the
dark
half
or
the
light
half
of
the
moon
will
return
to
visit
his
family
on
the
fourth
of
the
fortnight
of
the
manes
on
that
day
cakes
are
prepared
and
with
certain
ceremony
these
are
offered
to
the
unseen
hovering
spirit
their
implicit
belief
is
that
the
spirit
will
partake
of
the
essence
of
the
food
and
that
which
material
be
eaten
by
members
of
the
family
the
souls
of
women
it
is
said
will
all
come
on
the
ninth
of
the
fortnight
on
the
thirteenth
come
those
who
have
met
with
a
violent
death
and
who
lost
their
lives
by
a
fall
by
or
any
other
unusual
cause
during
the
fortnight
of
the
manes
a
woman
is
not
supposed
to
put
on
new
bangles
and
a
man
is
not
permitted
to
shave
in
short
this
is
a
season
of
sad
remembrances
an
annual
festival
for
the
the
bghais
a
karen
tribe
of
burma

an
annual

and
placed
in
a
small
house
in
the
forest
together
with
his
spear
or
gun
which
has
first
been
broken
these
little
huts
are
generally
arranged
in
groups
near
a
village
and
are
sometimes
large
enough
to
be
mistaken
for
one
after
harvest
all
the
relations
of
the
deceased
cook
various
kinds
of
food
and
take
them
with
pots
of
liquor
distilled
from

to
the
village
of
the
dead
there
they
open
the
doors
of
the
houses
and
having
placed
the
food
and
drink
inside
they
shut
them
again
after
that
they
weep

drink
and
return
home
the
great
festival
of
the
dead
in
cambodia
takes
place
on
the
last
day
of
the

but
ever
since
the

began
to
wane
everybody
has
been
busy
preparing
for
it
in
every
house
cakes
and
sweetmeats
are
set
out
candles
burn
incense
sticks
smoke
and
the
whole
is
offered
to
the
ancestral
shades
with
an
invocation
which
is
thrice
repeated
o
all
you
our
ancestors
who
are
departed
deign
to
come
and
eat
what
we
have
prepared
for
you
and
to
bless

little
boats
are
made
of
bark
and
filled
with
rice
cakes
small
coins
smoking
incense
sticks
and
lighted
candles
at
evening
these
are
set
floating
on
the
river
and
the
souls
of
the
dead
embark
in
them
to
return
to
their
own
place
the
living
now
bid
them
farewell
go
to
the
lands

will
return

will
return
you
will
the
river
is
now
covered
with
twinkling
points
of
fire
but
the
current
soon
bears
them
away
and
as
they
vanish
one
by
one
in
the
darkness
the
souls
depart
with
them
to
the
far
country
in
tonquin
as
in
sumba
the
dead
revisit
their
kinsfolk
and
their
old
homes
at
the
new
year
from
the
hour
of
midnight
when
the
new
year
begins
no
one
dares
to
shut
the
door
of
his
house
for
fear
of
excluding
the
ghosts
who
begin
to
arrive
at
that
time
preparations
have
been
made
to
welcome
and
refresh
them
after
their
long
journey
beds
and
mats
are
ready
for
their
weary
bodies
to
repose
upon
water
to
wash
their
dusty
feet
slippers
to
comfort
them
and
canes
to
support
their
feeble
steps
candles
burn
on
the
domestic
altar
and
pastilles
diffuse
a
fragrant
odour
the
people
bow
before
the
unseen
visitors
and
beseech
them
to
remember
and
bless
their
descendants
in
the
coming
year
having
discharged
this
pious
duty
they
abstain
from
sweeping
the
houses
for
three
days
lest
the
dust
should
incommode
the
ghosts
in
annam
one
of
the
most
important
festivals
of
the
year
is
the
festival
of
têt
which
falls
on
the
first
three
days
of
the
new
year
it
is
devoted
to
the
worship
of
ancestors
everybody
even
the
poorest
must
provide
a
good
meal
for
the
souls
of
his
dead
at
this
time
and
must
himself
eat
and
drink
heartily
some
families
in
order
to
discharge
this
pious
duty
run
into
debt
for
the
whole
year
in
the
houses
everything
is
put
in
order
washed
and
scoured
for
the
reception
of
the
dear
and
distinguished
guests
a
tall
bamboo
pole
is
set
up
in
the
front
of
every
house
and
allowed
to
stand
there
for
seven
days
a
small
basket
containing
areca
betel
and
leaves
of
gilt
paper
is
fastened
to
the
pole
the
erection
of
the
pole
is
a
sacred
rite
which
no
family
omits
to
perform
though
why
they
do
so
few
people
can
say
some
however
allege
that
the
posts
are
intended
to
guide
the
ancestral
spirits
to
their
old
homes
the
ceremony
of
the
reception
of
the
shades
takes
place
at
nightfall
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
the
house
of
the
head
of
the
family
is
then
decked
with
flowers
and
in
the
room
which
serves
as
a
domestic
chapel
the
altar
of
the
ancestors
is
surrounded
with
flowers
among
which
the
lotus
the
emblem
of
immortality
is
most
conspicuous
on
a
table
are
set
red
candles
perfumes
incense
and
plates
full
of
bananas
oranges
and
other
fruits
the
relations
crouch
before
the
altar
and
kneeling
at
the
foot
of
it
the
head
of
the
house
invokes
the
name
of
the
family
which
he
represents
then
in
solemn
tones
he
recites
an
incantation
mentioning
the
names
of
his
most
illustrious
ancestors
and
marking
time
with
the
strokes
of
a
hammer
upon
a
gong
while
crackers
are
exploded
outside
the
room
after
that
he
implores
the
ancestral
shades
to
protect
their
descendants
and
invites
them
to
a
repast
which
is
spread
for
them
on
a
table
round
this
table
he
walks
serving
the
invisible
guests
with
his
own
hands
he
distributes
to
them
smoking
balls
of
rice
in
little
china
saucers
and
pours
tea
or
spirits
into
each
little
cup
while
he
murmurs
words
of
invitation
and
compliment
when
the
ghosts
have
eaten
and
drunk
their
fill
the
head
of
the
family
returns
to
the
altar
and
salutes
them
for
the
last
time
finally
he
takes
leaves
of
yellow
paper
covered
with
gold
and
silver
spangles
and
throws
them
into
a
brazier
placed
at
the
foot
of
the
ancestral
tablets
these
papers
represent
imaginary
bars
of
gold
and
silver
which
the
living
send
to
the
dead
cardboard
models
of
houses
furniture
jewels
clothes
of
everything
in
short
that
the
ghosts
can
need
in
the
other
world
are
despatched
to
them
in
like
manner
in
the
flames
then
the
family
sits
down
to
table
and
feasts
on
the
remains
of
the
ghostly
banquet
but
in
annam
it
is
not
merely
the
spirits
of
ancestors
who
are
thus
feasted
and
supplied
with
all
the
necessaries
of
life
the
poor
ghosts
of
those
who
died
without
leaving
descendants
or
whose
bodies
were
left
unburied
are
not
forgotten
by
the
pious
annamites
but
these
spirits
come
round
at
a
different
time
of
year
from
the
others
the
seventh
month
of
the
year
is
set
apart
for
expiatory
sacrifices
destined
to
benefit
these
unhappy
beings
and
that
is
why
in
annam
nobody
should
marry
or
be
betrothed
in
that
month
the
great
day
of
the
month
is
the
fifteenth
which
is
called
the
festival
of
the
souls
on
that
day
the
ghosts
in
question
are
set
free
by
the
lord
of
the
underworld
and
they
come
prowling
about
among
the
living
they
are
exceedingly
dangerous
especially
to
children
hence
in
order
to
appease
their
wrath
and
prevent
them
from
entering
the
houses
every
family
takes
care
to
put
out
offerings
for
them
in
the
street
before
every
house
on
that
night
you
may
see
candles
lighted
paper
garments
of
many
colours
paper
hats
paper
boots
paper
furniture
ingots
of
gold
and
silver
paper
all
hanging
in
tempting
array
from
a
string
while
plates
of
food
and
cups
of
tea
and
stand
ready
for
the
use
of
hungry
and
thirsty
souls
the
theory
is
that
the
ghosts
will
be
so
busy
consuming
the
victuals
appropriating
the
deceitful
riches
and
trying
on
the
paper
coats
hats
and
boots
that
they
will
have
neither
the
leisure
nor
the
inclination
to
intrude
upon
the
domestic
circle
indoors
at
seven
o
clock
in
the
evening
fire
is
put
to
the
offerings
and
the
paper
wardrobe
furniture
and
money
soon
vanish
crackling
in
the
flames
at
the
same
moment
peeping
in
at
a
door
or
window
you
may
see
the
domestic
ancestral
altar
brilliantly
illuminated
as
for
the
food
it
is
supposed
to
be
thrown
on
the
fire
or
on
the
ground
for
the
use
of
the
ghosts
but
practically
it
is
eaten
by
vagabonds
and
beggars
who
scuffle
for
the
booty
in
cochinchina
the
ancestral
spirits
are
similarly
propitiated
and
fed
on
the
first
day
of
the
new
year
the
tablets
which
represent
them
are
placed
on
the
domestic
altar
and
the
family
prostrate
themselves
before
these
emblems
of
the
departed
the
head
of
the
family
lights
sticks
of
incense
on
the
altar
and
prays
the
shades
of
his
forefathers
to
accept
the
offerings
and
be
favourable
to
their
descendants
with
great
gravity
he
waits
upon
the
ghosts
passing
dishes
of
food
before
the
ancestral
tablets
and
pouring
out
wine
and
tea
to
slake
the
thirst
of
the
spirits
when
the
dead
are
supposed
to
be
satisfied
with
the
shadowy
essence
of
the
food
the
living
partake
of
its
gross
material
substance
in
siam
and
japan
also
the
souls
of
the
dead
revisit
their
families
for
three
days
in
every
year
and
the
lamps
which
the
japanese
kindle
in
multitudes
on
that
occasion
to
light
the
spirits
on
their
way
have
procured
for
the
festival
the
name
of
the
feast
of
lanterns
it
is
to
be
observed
that
in
siam
as
in
tonquin
and
sumba
the
return
of
the
ghosts
takes
place
at
the
new
year
the
chewsurs
of
the
caucasus
believe
that
the
souls
of
the
departed
revisit
their
old
homes
on
the
saturday
night
of
the
second
week
in
lent
this
gathering
of
the
dead
is
called
the
assembly
of
the
people
spare
no
expense
to
treat
the
unseen
guests
handsomely
beer
is
brewed
and
loaves
of
various
shapes
baked
specially
for
the
occasion
the
armenians
celebrate
the
memory
of
the
dead
on
many
days
of
the
year
burning
incense
and
lighting
tapers
in
their
honour
one
of
their
customs
is
to
keep
a
light
of
the
dead
burning
all
night
in
the
house
in
order
that
the
ghosts
may
be
able
to
enter
for
if
the
spirits
find
the
house
dark
they
spit
down
the
chimney
and
depart
cursing
the
churlish
inmates
early
in
april
every
year
the
dahomans
of
west
africa
set
a
table
as
they
term
it
and
invite
friends
to
eat
with
the
deceased
relatives
whose
spirits
are
supposed
to
move
round
and
partake
of
the
good
things
of
this
life
even
my
interpreter
lemon
who
pretends
to
despise
the
belief
in
fetish
sets
a
table
to
his
ancestors
and
will
tell
you
that
his
or
corporal
lemon
makes
a
meal
on
this
occasion
which
will
last
him
till
the
next
annual
the
barea
and
apparently
the
kunama
two
heathen
tribes
who
lead
a
settled
agricultural
life
to
the
north
of
abyssinia
celebrate
every
year
a
festival
in
the
month
of
november
it
is
a
festival
of
thanksgiving
for
the
completion
of
the
harvest
and
at
the
same
time
a
commemoration
and
propitiation
of
the
dead
every
house
prepares
much
beer
for
the
occasion
and
a
small
pot
of
beer
is
set
out
for
each
deceased
member
of
the
household
after
standing
for
two
days
in
the
house
the
beer
which
was
devoted
to
the
dead
is
drunk
by
the
living
at
these
festivals
all
the
people
of
a
district
meet
in
a
special
place
and
there
pass
the
time
in
games
and
dances
among
the
barea
the
festive
gatherings
are
held
in
a
sacred
grove
we
are
told
that
he
who
owes
another
a
drubbing
on
this
day
can
pay
his
debt
with
impunity
for
it
is
a
day
of
peace
when
all
feuds
are
in
wild
honey
may
not
be
gathered
till
the
festival
has
been
held
apparently
the
festival
is
a
sort
of
saturnalia
such
as
is
celebrated
elsewhere
at
the
end
of
harvest
at
that
season
there
is
food
and
to
spare
for
the
dead
as
well
as
the
living
among
peoples
of
the
aryan
stock
so
far
back
as
we
can
trace
their
history
the
worship
and
propitiation
of
the
dead
seem
to
have
formed
a
principal
element
of
the
popular
religion
and
like
so
many
other
races
they
appear
to
have
believed
that
once
a
year
the
souls
of
their
departed
kinsfolk
revisited
their
old
homes
and
expected
to
be
refreshed
with
abundance
of
good
cheer
by
their
surviving
relations
this
belief
gave
rise
to
the
custom
of
celebrating
an
annual
feast
of
all
souls
which
has
come
down
to
us
from
a
dateless
antiquity
and
is
still
observed
year
by
year
with
rites
of
primitive
simplicity
in
some
parts
of
europe
such
a
festival
was
held
every
year
in
spring
by
the
old
iranians
the
celebration
fell
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
lasted
ten
days
namely
the
last
five
days
of
the
last
month
and
the
five
following
supplementary
days
which
were
regularly
inserted
to
make
up
a
year
of
three
hundred
and
days
for
the
old
iranian
like
the
old
egyptian
year
was
a
vague
year
of
twelve
months
of
thirty
days
each
with
five
supplementary
days
added
at
the
end
for
the
sake
of
bringing
it
into
apparent
though
not
real
harmony
with
the
sun
s
annual
course
in
the
sky
according
to
one
calculation
the
ten
days
of
the
festival
corresponded
to
the
last
days
of
february
but
according
to
another
they
fell
in
march
in
later
ages
the
parsees
assigned
them
to
the
time
of
the
spring
equinox
the
name
of
the
festival
was
hamaspathmaedaya
from
a
passage
in
the
the
ancient
sacred
book
of
the
iranians
we
learn
that
on
the
ten
nights
of
the
festival
the
souls
of
the
dead
the
fravashis
were
believed
to
go
about
the
village
asking
the
people
to
do
them
reverence
to
pray
to
them
to
meditate
on
them
and
to
furnish
them
with
meat
and
clothes
while
at
the
same
time
they
promised
that
blessings
should
rest
on
the
pious
householder
who
complied
with
their
request
the
arab
geographer
albiruni
who
flourished
about
the
year
one
thousand
of
our
era
tells
us
that
among
the
persians
of
his
time
the
last
five
days
of
the
month
aban
were
called
farwardajan
during
this
time
he
says
people
put
food
in
the
halls
of
the
dead
and
drink
on
the
roofs
of
the
houses
believing
that
the
spirits
of
their
dead
during
these
days
come
out
from
the
places
of
their
reward
or
their
punishment
that
they
go
to
the
dishes
laid
out
for
them
imbibe
their
strength
and
suck
their
taste
they
fumigate
their
houses
with
juniper
that
the
dead
may
enjoy
its
smell
the
spirits
of
the
pious
men
dwell
among
their
families
children
and
relations
and
occupy
themselves
with
their
affairs
although
invisible
to
he
adds
that
there
was
a
controversy
among
the
persians
as
to
the
date
of
this
festival
of
the
dead
some
maintaining
that
the
five
days
during
which
it
lasted
were
the
last
five
days
of
the
month
aban
whereas
others
held
that
they
were
the
five
supplementary
days
which
were
inserted
between
the
months
aban
and
adhar
the
dispute
he
continues
was
settled
by
the
adoption
of
all
ten
days
for
the
celebration
of
the
feast
similar
beliefs
as
to
the
annual
return
of
the
dead
survive
to
this
day
in
many
parts
of
europe
and
find
expression
in
similar
customs
the
day
of
the
dead
or
of
all
souls
as
we
call
it
is
commonly
the
second
of
november
thus
in
lower
brittany
the
souls
of
the
departed
come
to
visit
the
living
on
the
eve
of
that
day
after
vespers
are
over
the
priests
and
choir
walk
in
procession
the
procession
of
the
chanting
a
weird
dirge
in
the
breton
tongue
then
the
people
go
home
gather
round
the
fire
and
talk
of
the
departed
the
housewife
covers
the
kitchen
table
with
a
white
cloth
sets
out
cider
curds
and
hot
pancakes
on
it
and
retires
with
the
family
to
rest
the
fire
on
the
hearth
is
kept
up
by
a
huge
log
known
as
the
log
of
the
dead
ann
soon
doleful
voices
outside
in
the
darkness
break
the
stillness
of
night
it
is
the
singers
of
death
who
go
about
the
streets
waking
the
sleepers
by
a
wild
and
melancholy
song
in
which
they
remind
the
living
in
their
comfortable
beds
to
pray
for
the
poor
souls
in
pain
all
that
night
the
dead
warm
themselves
at
the
hearth
and
feast
on
the
viands
prepared
for
them
sometimes
the
listeners
hear
the
stools
creaking
in
the
kitchen
or
the
dead
leaves
outside
rustling
under
the
ghostly
footsteps
in
the
vosges
mountains
on
all
souls
eve
the
solemn
sound
of
the
church
bells
invites
good
christians
to
pray
for
the
repose
of
the
dead
while
the
bells
are
ringing
it
is
customary
in
some
families
to
uncover
the
beds
and
open
the
windows
doubtless
in
order
to
let
the
poor
souls
enter
and
rest
no
one
that
evening
would
dare
to
remain
deaf
to
the
appeal
of
the
bells
the
prayers
are
prolonged
to
a
late
hour
of
the
night
when
the
last
has
been
uttered
the
head
of
the
family
gently
covers
up
the
beds
sprinkles
them
with
holy
water
and
shuts
the
windows
in
some
villages
fire
is
kept
up
on
the
hearth
and
a
basket
of
nuts
is
placed
beside
it
for
the
use
of
the
ghosts
again
in
some
parts
of
saintonge
and
aunis
a
candlemas
candle
used
to
be
lit
before
the
domestic
crucifix
on
all
souls
day
at
the
very
hour
when
the
last
member
of
the
family
departed
this
life
and
some
people
just
as
in
tonquin
refrained
from
sweeping
the
house
that
day
lest
they
should
thereby
disturb
the
ghostly
visitors
in
bruges
dinant
and
other
towns
of
belgium
holy
candles
burn
all
night
in
the
houses
on
the
eve
of
all
souls
and
the
bells
toll
till
midnight
or
even
till
morning
people
too
often
set
lighted
candles
on
the
graves
at
scherpenheuvel
the
houses
are
illuminated
and
the
people
walk
in
procession
carrying
lighted
candles
in
their
hands
a
very
common
custom
in
belgium
is
to
eat
or
on
the
eve
or
the
day
of
all
souls
the
eating
of
them
is
believed
to
benefit
the
dead
in
some
way
perhaps
originally
as
among
the
esquimaux
of
alaska
to
this
day
the
ghosts
were
thought
to
enter
into
the
bodies
of
their
relatives
and
so
to
share
the
victuals
which
the
survivors
consumed
similarly
at
festivals
in
honour
of
the
dead
in
northern
india
it
is
customary
to
feed
brahmans
and
the
food
which
these
holy
men
partake
of
is
believed
to
pass
to
the
deceased
and
to
refresh
their
languid
spirits
the
same
idea
of
eating
and
drinking
by
proxy
may
perhaps
partly
explain
many
other
funeral
feasts
be
that
as
it
may
at
dixmude
and
elsewhere
in
belgium
they
say
that
you
deliver
a
soul
from
purgatory
for
every
cake
you
eat
at
antwerp
they
give
a
local
colour
to
the
by
baking
them
with
plenty
of
saffron
the
deep
yellow
tinge
being
suggestive
of
the
flames
of
purgatory
people
in
antwerp
at
the
same
season
are
careful
not
to
slam
doors
or
windows
for
fear
of
hurting
the
ghosts
in
lechrain
a
district
of
southern
bavaria
which
extends
along
the
valley
of
the
lech
from
its
source
to
near
the
point
where
the
river
flows
into
the
danube
the
two
festivals
of
all
saints
and
all
souls
on
the
first
and
second
of
november
have
significantly
fused
in
popular
usage
into
a
single
festival
of
the
dead
in
fact
the
people
pay
little
or
no
heed
to
the
saints
and
give
all
their
thoughts
to
the
souls
of
their
departed
kinsfolk
the
feast
of
all
souls
begins
immediately
after
vespers
on
all
saints
day
even
on
the
eve
of
all
saints
day
that
is
on
the
of
october
which
we
call
hallowe
en
the
graveyard
is
cleaned
and
every
grave
adorned
the
decoration
consists
in
weeding
the
mounds
sprinkling
a
layer
of
charcoal
on
the
bare
earth
and
marking
out
patterns
on
it
in
red
the
marigold
too
is
still
in
bloom
at
that
season
in
cottage
gardens
and
garlands
of
its
orange
blooms
mingled
with
other
late
flowers
left
by
the
departing
summer
are
twined
about
the
grey
mossgrown
tombstones
the
basin
of
holy
water
is
filled
with
fresh
water
and
a
branch
of
put
into
it
for
in
the
popular
mind
is
associated
with
death
and
the
dead
on
the
eve
of
all
souls
day
the
people
begin
to
visit
the
graves
and
to
offer
the
to
the
hungry
souls
next
morning
before
eight
o
clock
commence
the
vigil
the
requiem
and
the
solemn
visitation
of
the
graves
on
that
day
every
household
offers
a
plate
of
meal
oats
and
spelt
on
a
in
the
church
while
in
the
middle
of
the
sacred
edifice
a
bier
is
set
covered
with
a
pall
and
surrounded
by
lighted
tapers
and
vessels
of
holy
water
the
tapers
burnt
on
that
day
and
indeed
generally
in
services
for
the
departed
are
red
in
the
evening
people
go
whenever
they
can
do
so
to
their
native
village
where
their
dear
ones
lie
in
the
churchyard
and
there
at
the
graves
they
pray
for
the
poor
souls
and
leave
an
offering
of
also
on
a
in
the
church
the
are
baked
of
dough
in
the
shape
of
a
coil
of
hair
and
are
made
of
all
sizes
up
to
three
feet
long
they
form
a
perquisite
of
the
sexton
the
custom
of
baking
sometimes
called
simply
souls
on
all
souls
day
is
widespread
in
southern
germany
and
austria
everywhere
we
may
assume
the
cakes
were
originally
intended
for
the
benefit
of
the
hungry
dead
though
they
are
often
eaten
by
the
living
in
the
upper
palatinate
people
throw
food
into
the
fire
on
all
souls
day
for
the
poor
souls
set
lights
on
the
table
for
them
and
pray
on
bended
knees
for
their
repose
on
the
graves
too
lights
are
kindled
vessels
of
holy
water
placed
and
food
deposited
for
the
refreshment
of
the
souls
all
over
the
upper
palatinate
on
all
souls
day
it
is
also
customary
to
bake
special
cakes
of
fine
bread
and
distribute
them
to
the
poor
who
eat
them
perhaps
as
the
deputies
of
the
dead
the
germans
of
bohemia
observe
all
souls
day
with
much
solemnity
each
family
celebrates
the
memory
of
its
dead
on
the
eve
of
the
day
it
is
customary
to
eat
cakes
and
to
drink
cold
milk
for
the
purpose
of
cooling
the
poor
souls
who
are
roasting
in
purgatory
from
which
it
appears
that
spirits
feel
the
soothing
effect
of
victuals
consumed
vicariously
by
their
friends
on
earth
the
ringing
of
the
church
bells
to
prayer
on
that
evening
is
believed
to
be
the
signal
at
which
the
ghosts
released
from
the
infernal
gaol
come
trooping
to
the
old
familiar
there
to
rest
from
their
pangs
for
a
single
night
so
in
many
places
people
fill
a
lamp
with
butter
light
it
and
set
it
on
the
hearth
that
with
the
butter
the
poor
ghosts
may
anoint
the
burns
they
have
received
from
the
sulphureous
and
tormenting
flames
of
purgatory
next
morning
the
chime
of
the
church
bells
ringing
to
early
mass
is
the
knell
that
bids
the
souls
return
to
their
place
of
pain
but
such
as
have
completed
their
penance
take
flight
to
heaven
so
on
the
eve
of
all
saints
day
each
family
gathers
in
the
parlour
or
the
kitchen
speaks
softly
of
those
they
have
lost
recalls
what
they
said
and
did
in
life
and
prays
for
the
repose
of
their
souls
while
the
prayer
is
being
said
the
children
kindle
little
wax
lights
which
have
been
specially
bought
for
the
purpose
that
day
next
morning
the
families
go
to
church
where
mass
is
celebrated
for
the
dead
then
they
wend
their

they
deck
the
graves
of
their
kinsfolk

lights
upon
them

custom
of

of
a
special
sort

of
white
wheaten

with
milk
are

great
quantity
of
corn
against

and
to
bake
it
into
five
or
six
hundred
little

he
gave

all

day
is
celebrated
with
similar
rites
by
the
germans
of
moravia
the
festival
of
the
farewell
to
summer
says
a
german
writer
on
this
subject
was
held
by
our
heathen
forefathers
in
the
beginning
of
november
and
with
the
memory
of
the
departed
summer
they
united
the
memory
of
the
departed
souls
and
this
last
has
survived
in
the
feast
of
all
souls
which
is
everywhere
observed
with
great
piety
on
the
evening
of
all
souls
the
relations
of
the
departed
assemble
in
the
churchyards
and
adorn
the
graves
of
their
dear
ones
with
flowers
and
lights
while
the
children
kindle
little
wax
tapers
which
have
been
bought
for
them
to
light
the
poor
according
to
the
popular
belief
the
dead
go
in
procession
to
the
church
about
midnight
and
any
young
man
can
there
see
all
the
living
men
who
will
die
within
the
in
the
tyrol
the
beliefs
and
customs
are
similar
there
too
that
is
lamps
filled
with
lard
or
butter
are
lighted
and
placed
on
the
hearth
on
all
souls
eve
in
order
that
poor
souls
escaped
from
the
fires
of
purgatory
may
smear
the
melted
grease
on
their
burns
and
so
alleviate
their
pangs
some
people
also
leave
milk
and
for
them
on
the
table
all
night
the
graves
also
are
illuminated
with
wax
candles
and
decked
with
such
a
profusion
of
flowers
that
you
might
think
it
was
springtime
in
the
italian
tyrol
it
is
customary
to
give
bread
or
money
to
the
poor
on
all
souls
day
in
the
val
di
ledro
children
threaten
to
dirty
the
doors
of
houses
if
they
do
not
get
the
usual
dole
some
rich
people
treat
the
poor
to
on
that
day
others
put
pitchers
full
of
water
in
the
kitchen
on
all
souls
night
that
the
poor
souls
may
slake
their
thirst
in
baden
it
is
still
customary
to
deck
the
graves
with
flowers
and
lights
on
all
saints
day
and
all
souls
day
the
lights
are
sometimes
kindled
in
hollow
turnips
on
the
sides
of
which
inscriptions
are
carved
and
shine
out
in
the
darkness
if
any
child
steals
a
or
anything
else
from
a
grave
the
indignant
ghost
who
has
been
robbed
appears
to
the
thief
the
same
night
and
reclaims
his
stolen
property
a
relic
of
the
old
custom
of
feeding
the
dead
survives
in
the
practice
of
giving
to
godchildren
the
letts
used
to
entertain
and
feed
the
souls
of
the
dead
for
four
weeks
from
michaelmas
september
to
the
day
of
simon
and
jude
october
they
called
the
season
or
and
regarded
it
as
so
holy
that
while
it
lasted
they
would
not
willingly
thresh
the
corn
alleging
that
grain
threshed
at
that
time
would
be
useless
for
sowing
since
the
souls
of
the
dead
would
not
allow
it
to
sprout
but
we
may
suspect
that
the
original
motive
of
the
abstinence
was
a
fear
lest
the
blows
of
the
flails
should
fall
upon
the
poor
ghosts
swarming
in
the
air
at
this
season
the
people
were
wont
to
prepare
food
of
all
sorts
for
the
spirits
and
set
it
on
the
floor
of
a
room
which
had
been
well
heated
and
swept
for
the
purpose
late
in
the
evening
the
master
of
the
house
went
into
the
room
tended
the
fire
and
called
upon
his
dead
kinsfolk
by
their
names
to
come
and
eat
and
drink
if
he
saw
the
ghosts
he
would
die
within
the
year
but
if
he
did
not
see
them
he
would
outlive
it
when
he
thought
the
souls
had
eaten
and
drunk
enough
he
took
the
staff
which
served
as
a
poker
and
laying
it
on
the
threshold
cut
it
in
two
with
an
axe
at
the
same
time
he
bade
the
spirits
go
their
way
charging
them
to
keep
to
the
roads
and
paths
and
not
to
tread
upon
the
rye
if
the
crops
turned
out
ill
next
year
the
people
laid
the
failure
at
the
door
of
the
ghosts
who
fancied
themselves
scurvily
treated
and
had
taken
their
revenge
by
trampling
down
the
corn
the
samagitians
annually
invited
the
dead
to
come
from
their
graves
and
enjoy
a
bath
and
a
feast
for
their
entertainment
they
prepared
a
special
hut
in
which
they
set
out
food
and
drink
together
with
a
seat
and
a
napkin
for
every
soul
who
had
been
invited
they
left
the
souls
to
revel
by
themselves
for
three
days
in
the
hut
then
they
deposited
the
remains
of
the
banquet
on
the
graves
and
bade
the
ghosts
farewell
the
good
things
however
were
usually
consumed
by
charcoal
burners
in
the
forest
this
feast
of
the
dead
fell
early
in
november
the
esthonians
prepare
a
meal
for
their
dead
on
all
souls
day
the
second
of
november
and
invite
them
by
their
names
to
come
and
partake
of
it
the
ghosts
arrive
in
the
early
morning
at
the
first
and
depart
at
the
second
being
ceremoniously
lighted
out
of
the
house
by
the
head
of
the
family
who
waves
a
white
cloth
after
them
and
bids
them
come
again
next
year
in
some
parts
of
the
russian
government
of
olonets
the
inhabitants
of
a
village
sometimes
celebrate
a
joint
festival
in
honour
of
all
their
dead
having
chosen
a
house
for
the
purpose
they
spread
three
tables
one
outside
the
front
door
one
in
the
passage
and
one
in
the
room
which
is
heated
by
a
stove
then
they
go
out
to
meet
their
unseen
guests
and
usher
them
into
the
house
with
these
words
ye
are
tired
our
own
ones
take
something
to
the
ghosts
accordingly
refresh
themselves
at
each
table
in
succession
then
the
master
of
the
house
bids
them
warm
themselves
at
the
stove
remarking
that
they
must
have
grown
cold
in
the
damp
earth
after
that
the
living
guests
sit
down
to
eat
at
the
tables
towards
the
end
of
the
meal
the
host
opens
the
window
and
lets
the
ghosts
gently
out
of
it
by
means
of
the
shroud
in
which
they
were
lowered
into
the
grave
as
they
slide
down
it
from
the
warm
room
into
the
outer
air
the
people
tell
them
now
it
is
time
for
you
to
go
home
and
your
feet
must
be
tired
the
way
is
not
a
little
one
for
you
to
travel
here
it
is
softer
for
you
now
in
god
s
name
farewell
among
the
votiaks
of
russia
every
family
sacrifices
to
its
dead
once
a
year
in
the
week
before
palm
sunday
the
sacrifice
is
offered
in
the
house
about
midnight
flesh
bread
or
cakes
and
beer
are
set
on
the

and
on
the
floor
beside
the
table
stands
a
trough
of
bark
with
a
lighted
wax
candle
stuck
on
the
rim
the
master
of
the
house
having
covered
his
head
with
his
hat
takes
a
piece
of
meat
in
his
hand
and
says
ye
spirits
of
the
long
departed
guard
and
preserve
us
well
make
none
of
us
cripples
send
no
plagues
upon
us
cause
the
corn
the
wine
and
the
food
to
prosper
with
the
votiaks
of
the
governments
of
wjatka
and
kasan
celebrate
two
memorial
festivals
of
the
dead
every
year
one
in
autumn
and
the
other
in
spring
on
a
certain
day
koumiss
is
distilled
beer
brewed
and
potato
scones
baked
in
every
house
all
the
members
of
a
clan
who
trace
their
descent
through
women
from
one
mythical
ancestress
assemble
in
a
single
house
generally
in
one
which
lies
at
the
boundary
of
the
clan
land
here
an
old
man
moulds
wax
candles
and
when
the
requisite
number
is
made
he
sticks
them
on
the
shelf
of
the
stove
and
begins
to
mention
the
dead
relations
of
the
master
of
the
house
by
name
for
each
of
them
he
crumbles
a
piece
of
bread
gives
each
of
them
a
piece
of
pancake
pours
koumiss
and
beer
and
puts
a
spoonful
of
soup
into
a
trough
made
for
the
purpose
all
persons
present
whose
parents
are
dead
follow
his
example
the
dogs
are
then
allowed
to
eat
out
of
the
trough
if
they
eat
quietly
it
is
a
sign
that
the
dead
live
at
peace
if
they
do
not
eat
quietly
it
argues
the
contrary
then
the
company
sit
down
to
table
and
partake
of
the
meal
next
morning
both
the
dead
and
the
living
refresh
themselves
with
a
drink
and
a
fowl
is
boiled
the
proceedings
are
the
same
as
on
the
evening
before
but
now
they
treat
the
souls
for
the
last
time
as
a
preparation
for
their
journey
saying
eat
drink
and
go
home
to
your
companions
live
at
peace
be
gracious
to
us
keep
our
children
guard
our
corn
our
beasts
and
then
the
people
banquet
and
indulge
in
all
sorts
of
improprieties
the
women
refrain
from
feasting
until
the
dead
have
taken
their
departure
but
when
the
souls
are
gone
there
is
no
longer
any
motive
for
abstinence
the
koumiss
circulates
freely
among
the
women
and
they
grow
wanton
yet
at
this
as
at
every
other
festival
the
men
and
women
eat
in
different
parts
of
the
room
on
all
saints
day
the
first
of
november
shops
and
streets
in
the
abruzzi
are
filled
with
candles
which
people
buy
in
order
to
kindle
them
in
the
evening
on
the
graves
of
their
relations
for
all
the
dead
come
to
visit
their
homes
that
night
the
eve
of
all
souls
and
they
need
lights
to
show
them
the
way
for
their
use
too
lights
are
kept
burning
in
the
houses
all
night
before
people
go
to
sleep
they
place
on
the
table
a
lighted
lamp
or
candle
and
a
frugal
meal
of
bread
and
water
the
dead
issue
from
their
graves
and
stalk
in
procession
through
every
street
of
the
village
you
can
see
them
if
you
stand
at
a
with
your
chin
resting
on
a
forked
stick
first
pass
the
souls
of
the
good
and
then
the
souls
of
the
murdered
and
the
damned
once
they
say
a
man
was
thus
peeping
at
the
ghastly
procession
the
good
souls
told
him
he
had
better
go
home
he
did
not
and
when
he
saw
the
tail
of
the
procession
he
died
of
fright
in
our
own
country
the
old
belief
in
the
annual
return
of
the
dead
long
lingered
in
the
custom
of
baking
and
eating
them
or
distributing
them
to
the
poor
on
all
souls
day
peasant
girls
used
to
go
from
farmhouse
to
farmhouse
on
that
day
singing
soul
for
a
soul
cake
you
good
mistress
a
soul
in
shropshire
down
to
the
seventeenth
century
it
was
customary
on
all
souls
day
to
set
on
the
table
a
high
heap
of
and
most
visitors
to
the
house
took
one
of
them
the
antiquary
john
aubrey
who
records
the
custom
mentions
also
the
appropriate
verses
a
mercy
on
all
christen
soules
for
a
indeed
the
custom
of
survived
in
shropshire
down
to
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
may
not
be
extinct
even
now
with
us
all
saints
day
is
known
as
souling
day
and
up
to
the
present
time
in
many
places
poor
children
and
sometimes
men
go
out
souling
which
means
that
they
go
round
to
the
houses
of
all
the
more
people
within
reach
reciting
a
ditty
peculiar
to
the
day
and
looking
for
a
dole
of
cakes
broken
victuals
ale
apples
or
money
the
two
latter
are
now
the
usual
rewards
but
there
are
few
old
north
salopians
who
can
not
remember
when
were
made
at
all
the
farms
and
bettermost
houses
in
readiness
for
the
day
and
were
given
to
all
who
came
for
them
we
are
told
of
liberal
housewives
who
would
provide
as
many
as
a
the
same
custom
of
going
out
on
all
saints
day
or
all
souls
day
used
to
be
observed
in
the
neighbouring
counties
of
staffordshire
cheshire
lancashire
herefordshire
and
monmouthshire
in
herefordshire
the
were
made
of
oatmeal
and
he
or
she
who
received
one
of
them
was
bound
to
say
to
the
giver
have
your
saul
and
thus
the
practice
of
souling
appears
to
have
prevailed
especially
in
the
english
counties
which
border
on
wales
in
many
parts
of
wales
itself
down
to
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
poor
peasants
used
to
go
about
begging
for
bread
on
all
souls
day
the
bread
bestowed
on
them
was
called
or
this
custom
was
a
survival
of
the
middle
ages
when
the
poor
begged
bread
for
the
souls
of
their
departed
relatives
and
however
the
custom
was
not
confined
to
the
west
of
england
for
at
whitby
in
yorkshire
down
to
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
it
was
usual
to
make
soul
mass
loaves
on
or
about
all
souls
day
they
were
small
round
loaves
sold
by
bakers
at
a
farthing
apiece
chiefly
for
presents
to
children
in
former
times
people
used
to
keep
one
or
two
of
them
for
good
luck
in
aberdeenshire
also
on
all
souls
day
baked
cakes
of
a
particular
sort
are
given
away
to
those
who
may
chance
to
visit
the
house
where
they
are
made
the
cakes
are
called
even
in
the
remote
island
of
kilda
it
was
customary
on
all
saints
day
to
bake
a
large
cake
in
the
form
of
a
triangle
furrowed
round
the
cake
must
be
all
eaten
that
night
the
same
mode
of
celebrating
all
souls
day
has
been
transported
by
catholicism
to
the
new
world
and
imparted
to
the
aborigines
of
that
continent
thus
in
carchi
a
province
of
ecuador
the
indians
prepare
foods
of
various
sorts
against
all
souls
day
and
when
the
day
has
come
they
take
some
of
the
provisions
to
the
church
and
there
deposit
them
on
tables
set
out
for
the
purpose
these
good
things
are
the
perquisite
of
the
priest
who
celebrates
mass
for
the
dead
after
the
service
the
indians
repair
to
the
cemetery
where
with
burning
candles
and
pots
of
holy
water
they
prostrate
themselves
before
the
tombs
of
their
relations
while
the
priest
or
the
sacristan
recites
prayers
for
the
souls
of
the
departed
in
the
evening
the
indians
return
to
their
houses
a
table
with
four
lights
on
it
is
spread
with
food
and
drink
especially
with
such
things
as
the
dead
loved
in
their
life
the
door
is
left
open
all
night
no
doubt
to
let
the
spirits
of
the
dead
enter
and
the
family
sits
up
keeping
the
invisible
guests
company
through
the
long
hours
of
darkness
from
seven
o
clock
and
onwards
troops
of
children
traverse
the
village
and
its
neighbourhood
they
go
from
house
to
house
ringing
a
bell
and
crying
we
are
angels
we
descend
from
the
sky
we
ask
for
the
people
go
to
their
doors
and
beg
the
children
to
recite
a
or
an
for
the
dead
whom
they
name
when
the
prayer
has
been
duly
said
they
give
the
children
a
little
of
the
food
from
the
table
all
night
long
this
goes
on
band
succeeding
band
of
children
at
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
family
consumes
the
remainder
of
the
food
of
the
souls
here
the
children
going
from
door
to
door
during
the
night
of
all
souls
appear
to
personate
the
souls
of
the
dead
who
are
also
abroad
at
that
time
hence
to
give
bread
to
the
children
is
the
same
thing
as
to
give
bread
to
the
poor
hungry
souls
probably
the
same
explanation
applies
to
the
giving
of
to
children
and
the
poor
on
all
souls
day
in
europe
a
comparison
of
these
european
customs
with
the
similar
heathen
rites
can
leave
no
room
for
doubt
that
the
nominally
christian
feast
of
all
souls
is
nothing
but
an
old
pagan
festival
of
the
dead
which
the
church
unable
or
unwilling
to
suppress
resolved
from
motives
of
policy
to
connive
at
but
whence
did
it
borrow
the
practice
of
solemnizing
the
festival
on
that
particular
day
the
second
of
november
in
order
to
answer
this
question
we
should
observe
first
that
celebrations
of
this
sort
are
often
held
at
the
beginning
of
a
new
year
and
second
that
the
peoples
of
europe
the
celts
and
the
teutons
appear
to
have
dated
the
beginning
of
their
year
from
the
beginning
of
winter
the
celts
reckoning
it
from
the
first
of
november
and
the
teutons
from
the
first
of
october
the
difference
of
reckoning
may
be
due
to
a
difference
of
climate
the
home
of
the
teutons
in
central
and
northern
europe
being
a
region
where
winter
sets
in
earlier
than
on
the
more
temperate
and
humid
coasts
of
the
atlantic
the
home
of
the
celts
these
considerations
suggest
that
the
festival
of
all
souls
on
the
second
of
november
originated
with
the
celts
and
spread
from
them
to
the
rest
of
the
european
peoples
who
while
they
preserved
their
old
feasts
of
the
dead
practically
unchanged
may
have
transferred
them
to
the
second
of
november
this
conjecture
is
supported
by
what
we
know
of
the
ecclesiastical
institution
or
rather
recognition
of
the
festival
for
that
recognition
was
first
accorded
at
the
end
of
the
tenth
century
in
france
a
celtic
country
from
which
the
church
festival
gradually
spread
over
europe
it
was
odilo
abbot
of
the
great
benedictine
monastery
of
clugny
who
initiated
the
change
in
by
ordering
that
in
all
the
monasteries
over
which
he
ruled
a
solemn
mass
should
be
celebrated
on
the
second
of
november
for
all
the
dead
who
sleep
in
christ
the
example
thus
set
was
followed
by
other
religious
houses
and
the
bishops
one
after
another
introduced
the
new
celebration
into
their
dioceses
thus
the
festival
of
all
souls
gradually
established
itself
throughout
christendom
though
in
fact
the
church
has
never
formally
sanctioned
it
by
a
general
edict
nor
attached
much
weight
to
its
observance
indeed
when
objections
were
raised
to
the
festival
at
the
reformation
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
seemed
ready
to
abandon
it
these
facts
are
explained
very
simply
by
the
theory
that
an
old
celtic
commemoration
of
the
dead
lingered
in
france
down
to
the
end
of
the
tenth
century
and
was
then
as
a
measure
of
policy
and
a
concession
to
ineradicable
paganism
at
last
incorporated
in
the
catholic
ritual
the
consciousness
of
the
heathen
origin
of
the
practice
would
naturally
prevent
the
supreme
authorities
from
insisting
strongly
on
its
observance
they
appear
rightly
to
have
regarded
it
as
an
outpost
which
they
could
surrender
to
the
forces
of
rationalism
without
endangering
the
citadel
of
the
faith
perhaps
we
may
go
a
step
further
and
explain
in
like
manner
the
origin
of
the
feast
of
all
saints
on
the
first
of
november
for
the
analogy
of
similar
customs
elsewhere
would
lead
us
to
suppose
that
the
old
celtic
festival
of
the
dead
was
held
on
the
celtic
new
year
s
day
that
is
on
the
first
not
the
second
of
november
may
not
then
the
institution
of
the
feast
of
all
saints
on
that
day
have
been
the
first
attempt
of
the
church
to
give
a
colour
of
christianity
to
the
ancient
heathen
rite
by
substituting
the
saints
for
the
souls
of
the
dead
as
the
true
object
of
worship
the
facts
of
history
seem
to
countenance
this
hypothesis
for
the
feast
of
all
saints
was
instituted
in
france
and
germany
by
order
of
the
emperor
lewis
the
pious
in
that
is
about
a
hundred
and
sixty
years
before
the
introduction
of
the
feast
of
all
souls
the
innovation
was
made
by
the
advice
of
the
pope
gregory
whose
motive
may
well
have
been
that
of
suppressing
an
old
pagan
custom
which
was
still
notoriously
practised
in
france
and
germany
the
idea
however
was
not
a
novel
one
for
the
testimony
of
bede
proves
that
in
britain
another
celtic
country
the
feast
of
all
saints
on
the
first
of
november
was
already
celebrated
in
the
eighth
century
we
may
conjecture
that
this
attempt
to
divert
the
devotion
of
the
faithful
from
the
souls
of
the
dead
to
the
saints
proved
a
failure
and
that
finally
the
church
reluctantly
decided
to
sanction
the
popular
superstition
by
frankly
admitting
a
feast
of
all
souls
into
the
calendar
but
it
could
not
assign
the
new
or
rather
the
old
festival
to
the
old
day
the
first
of
november
since
that
was
already
occupied
by
the
feast
of
all
saints
accordingly
it
placed
the
mass
for
the
dead
on
the
next
day
the
second
of
november
on
this
theory
the
feasts
of
all
saints
and
of
all
souls
mark
two
successive
efforts
of
the
catholic
church
to
eradicate
an
old
heathen
festival
of
the
dead
both
efforts
failed
in
all
catholic
countries
the
day
of
all
souls
has
preserved
the
serious
character
of
a
festival
of
the
dead
which
no
worldly
gaieties
are
allowed
to
disturb
it
is
then
the
sacred
duty
of
the
survivors
to
visit
the
graves
of
their
loved
ones
in
the
churchyard
to
deck
them
with
flowers
and
lights
and
to
utter
a
devout
pious
custom
with
which
in
cities
like
paris
and
vienna
even
the
gay
and
frivolous
comply
for
the
sake
of
appearance
if
not
to
satisfy
an
impulse
of
the
the
festival
in
the
month
of
athyr
the
foregoing
evidence
lends
some
support
to
the
it
is
only
a
the
great
festival
of
osiris
at
sais
with
its
accompanying
illumination
of
the
houses
was
a
night
of
all
souls
when
the
ghosts
of
the
dead
swarmed
in
the
streets
and
revisited
their
old
homes
which
were
lit
up
to
welcome
them
back
again
herodotus
who
briefly
describes
the
festival
omits
to
mention
its
date
but
we
can
determine
it
with
some
probability
from
other
sources
thus
plutarch
tells
us
that
osiris
was
murdered
on
the
seventeenth
of
the
month
athyr
and
that
the
egyptians
accordingly
observed
mournful
rites
for
four
days
from
the
seventeenth
of
athyr
now
in
the
alexandrian
calendar
which
plutarch
used
these
four
days
corresponded
to
the
thirteenth
fourteenth
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
of
november
and
this
date
answers
exactly
to
the
other
indications
given
by
plutarch
who
says
that
at
the
time
of
the
festival
the
nile
was
sinking
the
north
winds
dying
away
the
nights
lengthening
and
the
leaves
falling
from
the
trees
during
these
four
days
a
gilt
cow
swathed
in
a
black
pall
was
exhibited
as
an
image
of
isis
this
no
doubt
was
the
image
mentioned
by
herodotus
in
his
account
of
the
festival
on
the
nineteenth
day
of
the
month
the
people
went
down
to
the
sea
the
priests
carrying
a
shrine
which
contained
a
golden
casket
into
this
casket
they
poured
fresh
water
and
thereupon
the
spectators
raised
a
shout
that
osiris
was
found
after
that
they
took
some
vegetable
mould
moistened
it
with
water
mixed
it
with
precious
spices
and
incense
and
moulded
the
paste
into
a
small
image
which
was
then
robed
and
ornamented
thus
it
appears
that
the
purpose
of
the
ceremonies
described
by
plutarch
was
to
represent
dramatically
first
the
search
for
the
dead
body
of
osiris
and
second
its
joyful
discovery
followed
by
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
god
who
came
to
life
again
in
the
new
image
of
vegetable
mould
and
spices
lactantius
tells
us
how
on
these
occasions
the
priests
with
their
shaven
bodies
beat
their
breasts
and
lamented
imitating
the
sorrowful
search
of
isis
for
her
lost
son
osiris
and
how
afterwards
their
sorrow
was
turned
to
joy
when
the
god
anubis
or
rather
a
mummer
in
his
stead
produced
a
small
boy
the
living
representative
of
the
god
who
was
lost
and
was
found
thus
lactantius
regarded
osiris
as
the
son
instead
of
the
husband
of
isis
and
he
makes
no
mention
of
the
image
of
vegetable
mould
it
is
probable
that
the
boy
who
figured
in
the
sacred
drama
played
the
part
not
of
osiris
but
of
his
son
horus
but
as
the
death
and
resurrection
of
the
god
were
celebrated
in
many
cities
of
egypt
it
is
also
possible
that
in
some
places
the
part
of
the
god
come
to
life
was
played
by
a
living
actor
instead
of
by
an
image
another
christian
writer
describes
how
the
egyptians
with
shorn
heads
annually
lamented
over
a
buried
idol
of
osiris
smiting
their
breasts
slashing
their
shoulders
ripping
open
their
old
wounds
until
after
several
days
of
mourning
they
professed
to
find
the
mangled
remains
of
the
god
at
which
they
rejoiced
however
the
details
of
the
ceremony
may
have
varied
in
different
places
the
pretence
of
finding
the
god
s
body
and
probably
of
restoring
it
to
life
was
a
great
event
in
the
festal
year
of
the
egyptians
the
shouts
of
joy
which
greeted
it
are
described
or
alluded
to
by
many
ancient
writers
the
festival
in
the
month
of
khoiak
the
funeral
rites
of
osiris
as
they
were
observed
at
his
great
festival
in
the
sixteen
provinces
of
egypt
are
described
in
a
long
inscription
of
the
ptolemaic
period
which
is
engraved
on
the
walls
of
the
god
s
temple
at
denderah
the
tentyra
of
the
greeks
a
town
of
upper
egypt
situated
on
the
western
bank
of
the
nile
about
forty
miles
north
of
thebes
unfortunately
while
the
information
thus
furnished
is
remarkably
full
and
minute
on
many
points
the
arrangement
adopted
in
the
inscription
is
so
confused
and
the
expression
often
so
obscure
that
a
clear
and
consistent
account
of
the
ceremonies
as
a
whole
can
hardly
be
extracted
from
it
moreover
we
learn
from
the
document
that
the
ceremonies
varied
somewhat
in
the
several
cities
the
ritual
of
abydos
for
example
differing
from
that
of
busiris
without
attempting
to
trace
all
the
particularities
of
local
usage
i
shall
briefly
indicate
what
seem
to
have
been
the
leading
features
of
the
festival
so
far
as
these
can
be
ascertained
with
tolerable
certainty
the
rites
lasted
eighteen
days
from
the
twelfth
to
the
thirtieth
of
the
month
khoiak
and
set
forth
the
nature
of
osiris
in
his
triple
aspect
as
dead
dismembered
and
finally
reconstituted
by
the
union
of
his
scattered
limbs
in
the
first
of
these
aspects
he
was
called
in
the
second
and
in
the
third
sokari
seker
small
images
of
the
god
were
moulded
of
sand
or
vegetable
earth
and
corn
to
which
incense
was
sometimes
added
his
face
was
painted
yellow
and
his
green
these
images
were
cast
in
a
mould
of
pure
gold
which
represented
the
god
in
the
form
of
a
mummy
with
the
white
crown
of
egypt
on
his
head
the
festival
opened
on
the
twelfth
day
of
khoiak
with
a
ceremony
of
ploughing
and
sowing
two
black
cows
were
yoked
to
the
plough
which
was
made
of
tamarisk
wood
while
the
share
was
of
black
copper
a
boy
scattered
the
seed
one
end
of
the
field
was
sown
with
barley
the
other
with
spelt
and
the
middle
with
flax
during
the
operation
the
chief
celebrant
recited
the
ritual
chapter
of
the
sowing
of
the
at
busiris
on
the
twentieth
of
khoiak
sand
and
barley
were
put
in
the
god
s
garden
which
appears
to
have
been
a
sort
of
large
this
was
done
in
the
presence
of
the
shenty
represented
seemingly
by
the
image
of
a
cow
made
of
gilt
sycamore
wood
with
a
headless
human
image
in
its
inside
then
fresh
inundation
water
was
poured
out
of
a
golden
vase
over
both
the
goddess
and
the
garden
and
the
barley
was
allowed
to
grow
as
the
emblem
of
the
resurrection
of
the
god
after
his
burial
in
the
earth
for
the
growth
of
the
garden
is
the
growth
of
the
divine
on
the
of
khoiak
at
the
eighth
hour
the
images
of
osiris
attended
by
images
of
deities
performed
a
mysterious
voyage
in
tiny
boats
made
of
papyrus
which
were
illuminated
by
three
hundred
and
lights
on
the
of
khoiak
after
sunset
the
effigy
of
osiris
in
a
coffin
of
mulberry
wood
was
laid
in
the
grave
and
at
the
ninth
hour
of
the
night
the
effigy
which
had
been
made
and
deposited
the
year
before
was
removed
and
placed
upon
boughs
of
sycamore
lastly
on
the
thirtieth
day
of
khoiak
they
repaired
to
the
holy
sepulchre
a
subterranean
chamber
over
which
appears
to
have
grown
a
clump
of
entering
the
vault
by
the
western
door
they
laid
the
coffined
effigy
of
the
dead
god
reverently
on
a
bed
of
sand
in
the
chamber
so
they
left
him
to
his
rest
and
departed
from
the
sepulchre
by
the
eastern
door
thus
ended
the
ceremonies
in
the
month
of
khoiak
the
resurrection
of
osiris
in
the
foregoing
account
of
the
festival
drawn
from
the
great
inscription
of
denderah
the
burial
of
osiris
figures
prominently
while
his
resurrection
is
implied
rather
than
expressed
this
defect
of
the
document
however
is
amply
compensated
by
a
remarkable
series
of
which
accompany
and
illustrate
the
inscription
these
exhibit
in
a
series
of
scenes
the
dead
god
lying
swathed
as
a
mummy
on
his
bier
then
gradually
raising
himself
up
higher
and
higher
until
at
last
he
has
entirely
quitted
the
bier
and
is
seen
erect
between
the
guardian
wings
of
the
faithful
isis
who
stands
behind
him
while
a
male
figure
holds
up
before
his
eyes
the
the
egyptian
symbol
of
life
the
resurrection
of
the
god
could
hardly
be
portrayed
more
graphically
even
more
instructive
however
is
another
representation
of
the
same
event
in
a
chamber
dedicated
to
osiris
in
the
great
temple
of
isis
at
philae
here
we
see
the
dead
body
of
osiris
with
stalks
of
corn
springing
from
it
while
a
priest
waters
the
stalks
from
a
pitcher
which
he
holds
in
his
hand
the
accompanying
inscription
sets
forth
that
this
is
the
form
of
him
whom
one
may
not
name
osiris
of
the
mysteries
who
springs
from
the
returning
taken
together
the
picture
and
the
words
seem
to
leave
no
doubt
that
osiris
was
here
conceived
and
represented
as
a
personification
of
the
corn
which
springs
from
the
fields
after
they
have
been
fertilized
by
the
inundation
this
according
to
the
inscription
was
the
kernel
of
the
mysteries
the
innermost
secret
revealed
to
the
initiated
so
in
the
rites
of
demeter
at
eleusis
a
reaped
ear
of
corn
was
exhibited
to
the
worshippers
as
the
central
mystery
of
their
religion
we
can
now
fully
understand
why
at
the
great
festival
of
sowing
in
the
month
of
khoiak
the
priests
used
to
bury
effigies
of
osiris
made
of
earth
and
corn
when
these
effigies
were
taken
up
again
at
the
end
of
a
year
or
of
a
shorter
interval
the
corn
would
be
found
to
have
sprouted
from
the
body
of
osiris
and
this
sprouting
of
the
grain
would
be
hailed
as
an
omen
or
rather
as
the
cause
of
the
growth
of
the
crops
the
produced
the
corn
from
himself
he
gave
his
own
body
to
feed
the
people
he
died
that
they
might
live
and
from
the
death
and
resurrection
of
their
great
god
the
egyptians
drew
not
only
their
support
and
sustenance
in
this
life
but
also
their
hope
of
a
life
eternal
beyond
the
grave
this
hope
is
indicated
in
the
clearest
manner
by
the
very
remarkable
effigies
of
osiris
which
have
come
to
light
in
egyptian
cemeteries
thus
in
the
valley
of
the
kings
at
thebes
there
was
found
the
tomb
of
a
royal
who
lived
about
among
the
rich
contents
of
the
tomb
there
was
a
bier
on
which
rested
a
mattress
of
reeds
covered
with
three
layers
of
linen
on
the
upper
side
of
the
linen
was
painted
a
figure
of
osiris
and
the
interior
of
the
figure
which
was
waterproof
contained
a
mixture
of
vegetable
mould
barley
and
a
sticky
fluid
the
barley
had
sprouted
and
sent
out
shoots
two
or
three
inches
long
again
in
the
cemetery
at
cynopolis
were
numerous
burials
of
osiris
figures
these
were
made
of
grain
wrapped
up
in
cloth
and
roughly
shaped
like
an
osiris
and
placed
inside
a
recess
at
the
side
of
the
tomb
sometimes
in
small
pottery
coffins
sometimes
in
wooden
coffins
in
the
form
of
a
sometimes
without
any
coffins
at
these
figures
were
bandaged
like
mummies
with
patches
of
gilding
here
and
there
as
if
in
imitation
of
the
golden
mould
in
which
the
similar
figures
of
osiris
were
cast
at
the
festival
of
sowing
again
effigies
of
osiris
with
faces
of
green
wax
and
their
interior
full
of
grain
were
found
buried
near
the
necropolis
of
thebes
finally
we
are
told
by
professor
erman
that
between
the
legs
of
mummies
there
sometimes
lies
a
figure
of
osiris
made
of
slime
it
is
filled
with
grains
of
corn
the
sprouting
of
which
is
intended
to
signify
the
resurrection
of
the
we
can
not
doubt
that
just
as
the
burial
of
images
of
osiris
in
the
earth
at
the
festival
of
sowing
was
designed
to
quicken
the
seed
so
the
burial
of
similar
images
in
the
grave
was
meant
to
quicken
the
dead
in
other
words
to
ensure
their
spiritual
immortality
readjustment
of
egyptian
festivals
the
festival
of
osiris
which
plutarch
assigns
to
the
month
of
athyr
would
seem
to
be
identical
in
substance
with
the
one
which
the
inscription
of
denderah
assigns
to
the
following
month
namely
to
khoiak
apparently
the
essence
of
both
festivals
was
a
dramatic
representation
of
the
death
and
resurrection
of
the
god
in
both
of
them
isis
was
figured
by
a
gilt
cow
and
osiris
by
an
image
moulded
of
moist
vegetable
earth
but
if
the
festivals
were
the
same
why
were
they
held
in
different
months
it
is
easy
to
suggest
that
different
towns
in
egypt
celebrated
the
festival
at
different
dates
but
when
we
remember
that
according
to
the
great
inscription
of
denderah
the
authority
of
which
is
indisputable
the
festival
fell
in
the
month
of
khoiak
in
every
province
of
egypt
we
shall
be
reluctant
to
suppose
that
at
some
one
place
or
even
at
a
few
places
it
was
exceptionally
held
in
the
preceding
month
of
athyr
and
that
the
usually
plutarch
described
the
exception
as
if
it
had
been
the
rule
of
which
on
this
supposition
he
must
have
been
wholly
ignorant
more
probably
the
discrepancy
is
to
be
explained
by
the
great
change
which
came
over
the
egyptian
calendar
between
the
date
of
the
inscription
and
the
lifetime
of
plutarch
for
when
the
inscription
was
drawn
up
in
the
ptolemaic
age
the
festivals
were
dated
by
the
old
vague
or
movable
year
and
therefore
rotated
gradually
through
the
whole
circle
of
the
seasons
whereas
at
the
time
when
plutarch
wrote
about
the
end
of
the
first
century
they
were
seemingly
dated
by
the
fixed
alexandrian
year
and
accordingly
had
ceased
to
rotate
but
even
if
we
grant
that
in
plutarch
s
day
the
festivals
had
become
stationary
still
this
would
not
explain
why
the
old
festival
of
khoiak
had
been
transferred
to
athyr
in
order
to
understand
that
transference
it
seems
necessary
to
suppose
that
when
the
egyptians
gave
to
their
months
fixed
places
in
the
solar
year
by
accepting
the
alexandrian
system
of
intercalation
they
at
the
same
time
transferred
the
festivals
from
what
may
be
called
their
artificial
to
their
natural
dates
under
the
old
system
a
summer
festival
was
sometimes
held
in
winter
and
a
winter
festival
in
summer
a
harvest
celebration
sometimes
fell
at
the
season
of
sowing
and
a
sowing
celebration
at
the
season
of
harvest
people
might
reconcile
themselves
to
such
anomalies
so
long
as
they
knew
that
they
were
only
temporary
and
that
in
the
course
of
time
the
festivals
would
necessarily
return
to
their
proper
seasons
but
it
must
have
been
otherwise
when
they
adopted
a
fixed
instead
of
a
movable
year
and
so
arrested
the
rotation
of
the
festivals
for
ever
for
they
could
not
but
be
aware
that
every
festival
would
thenceforth
continue
to
occupy
for
all
time
that
particular
place
in
the
solar
year
which
it
chanced
to
occupy
in
the
year
when
the
calendar
became
fixed
if
in
that
particular
year
it
happened
as
it
might
have
happened
that
the
summer
festivals
were
held
in
winter
and
the
winter
festivals
in
summer
they
would
always
be
so
held
in
future
the
absurdity
and
anomaly
would
never
again
be
rectified
as
it
had
been
before
this
consideration
which
could
not
have
escaped
intelligent
men
must
have
suggested
the
advisability
of
transferring
the
festivals
from
the
dates
at
which
they
chanced
to
be
celebrated
in
to
the
dates
at
which
they
ought
properly
to
be
celebrated
in
the
course
of
nature
now
what
in
the
year
was
the
actual
amount
of
discrepancy
between
the
accidental
and
the
natural
dates
of
the
festivals
it
was
a
little
more
than
a
month
in
that
year
thoth
the
first
month
of
the
egyptian
calendar
happened
to
begin
on
the
of
august
whereas
according
to
theory
it
should
have
begun
with
the
heliacal
rising
of
sirius
on
the
twentieth
of
july
that
is
forty
days
or
roughly
speaking
a
month
earlier
from
this
it
follows
that
in
the
year
all
the
egyptian
festivals
fell
about
a
month
later
than
their
natural
dates
and
they
must
have
continued
to
fall
a
month
late
for
ever
if
they
were
allowed
to
retain
those
places
in
the
calendar
which
they
chanced
to
occupy
in
that
particular
year
in
these
circumstances
it
would
be
a
natural
and
sensible
thing
to
restore
the
festivals
to
their
proper
places
in
the
solar
year
by
celebrating
them
one
calendar
month
earlier
than
before
if
this
measure
were
adopted
the
festivals
which
had
hitherto
been
held
for
example
in
the
third
month
athyr
would
henceforth
be
held
in
the
second
month
phaophi
the
festivals
which
had
hitherto
fallen
in
the
fourth
month
khoiak
would
thenceforth
fall
in
the
third
month
athyr
and
so
on
thus
the
festal
calendar
would
be
reduced
to
harmony
with
the
seasons
instead
of
being
in
more
or
less
flagrant
discord
with
them
as
it
had
generally
been
before
and
must
always
have
been
afterwards
if
the
change
which
i
have
indicated
had
not
been
introduced
it
is
only
to
credit
the
native
astronomers
and
the
roman
rulers
of
egypt
with
common
sense
to
suppose
that
they
actually
adopted
the
measure
on
that
supposition
we
can
perfectly
understand
why
the
festival
of
sowing
which
had
formerly
belonged
to
the
month
of
khoiak
was
transferred
to
athyr
for
in
the
alexandrian
calendar
khoiak
corresponds
very
nearly
to
december
and
athyr
to
november
but
in
egypt
the
month
of
november
not
the
month
of
december
is
the
season
of
sowing
there
was
therefore
every
reason
why
the
great
sowing
festival
of
the
osiris
should
be
held
in
athyr
and
not
khoiak
in
november
and
not
in
december
in
like
manner
we
may
suppose
that
all
the
egyptian
festivals
were
restored
to
their
true
places
in
the
solar
year
and
that
when
plutarch
dates
a
festival
both
by
its
calendar
month
and
by
its
relation
to
the
cycle
of
the
seasons
he
is
perfectly
right
in
doing
so
and
we
may
accept
his
evidence
with
confidence
instead
of
having
to
accuse
him
of
ignorantly
confounding
the
movable
egyptian
with
the
fixed
alexandrian
year
accusations
of
ignorance
levelled
at
the
best
writers
of
antiquity
are
apt
to
recoil
on
those
who
make
them
chapter
the
nature
of
osiris
osiris
a
the
foregoing
survey
of
the
myth
and
ritual
of
osiris
may
suffice
to
prove
that
in
one
of
his
aspects
the
god
was
a
personification
of
the
corn
which
may
be
said
to
die
and
come
to
life
again
every
year
through
all
the
pomp
and
glamour
with
which
in
later
times
the
priests
had
invested
his
worship
the
conception
of
him
as
the
comes
clearly
out
in
the
festival
of
his
death
and
resurrection
which
was
celebrated
in
the
month
of
khoiak
and
at
a
later
period
in
the
month
of
athyr
that
festival
appears
to
have
been
essentially
a
festival
of
sowing
which
properly
fell
at
the
time
when
the
husbandman
actually
committed
the
seed
to
the
earth
on
that
occasion
an
effigy
of
the
moulded
of
earth
and
corn
was
buried
with
funeral
rites
in
the
ground
in
order
that
dying
there
he
might
come
to
life
again
with
the
new
crops
the
ceremony
was
in
fact
a
charm
to
ensure
the
growth
of
the
corn
by
sympathetic
magic
and
we
may
conjecture
that
as
such
it
was
practised
in
a
simple
form
by
every
egyptian
farmer
on
his
fields
long
before
it
was
adopted
and
transfigured
by
the
priests
in
the
stately
ritual
of
the
temple
in
the
modern
but
doubtless
ancient
arab
custom
of
burying
the
old
man
namely
a
sheaf
of
wheat
in
the
and
praying
that
he
may
return
from
the
dead
we
see
the
germ
out
of
which
the
worship
of
the
osiris
was
probably
developed
earth
what
more
appropriate
parentage
could
be
invented
for
the
corn
which
springs
from
the
ground
that
has
been
fertilized
by
the
water
of
heaven
it
is
true
that
the
land
of
egypt
owed
its
fertility
directly
to
the
nile
and
not
to
showers
but
the
inhabitants
must
have
known
or
guessed
that
the
great
river
in
its
turn
was
fed
by
the
rains
which
fell
in
the
far
interior
again
the
legend
that
osiris
was
the
first
to
teach
men
the
use
of
corn
would
be
most
naturally
told
of
the
himself
further
the
story
that
his
mangled
remains
were
scattered
up
and
down
the
land
and
buried
in
different
places
may
be
a
mythical
way
of
expressing
either
the
sowing
or
the
winnowing
of
the
grain
the
latter
interpretation
is
supported
by
the
tale
that
isis
placed
the
severed
limbs
of
osiris
on
a
or
more
probably
the
legend
may
be
a
reminiscence
of
a
custom
of
slaying
a
human
victim
perhaps
a
representative
of
the
and
distributing
his
flesh
or
scattering
his
ashes
over
the
fields
to
fertilize
them
in
modern
europe
the
figure
of
death
is
sometimes
torn
in
pieces
and
the
fragments
are
then
buried
in
the
ground
to
make
the
crops
grow
well
and
in
other
parts
of
the
world
human
victims
are
treated
in
the
same
way
with
regard
to
the
ancient
egyptians
we
have
it
on
the
authority
of
manetho
that
they
used
to
burn
men
and
scatter
their
ashes
with
winnowing
fans
and
it
is
highly
significant
that
this
barbarous
sacrifice
was
offered
by
the
kings
at
the
grave
of
osiris
we
may
conjecture
that
the
victims
represented
osiris
himself
who
was
annually
slain
dismembered
and
buried
in
their
persons
that
he
might
quicken
the
seed
in
the
earth
possibly
in
prehistoric
times
the
kings
themselves
played
the
part
of
the
god
and
were
slain
and
dismembered
in
that
character
set
as
well
as
osiris
is
said
to
have
been
torn
in
pieces
after
a
reign
of
eighteen
days
which
was
commemorated
by
an
annual
festival
of
the
same
length
according
to
one
story
romulus
the
first
king
of
rome
was
cut
in
pieces
by
the
senators
who
buried
the
fragments
of
him
in
the
ground
and
the
traditional
day
of
his
death
the
seventh
of
july
was
celebrated
with
certain
curious
rites
which
were
apparently
connected
with
the
artificial
fertilization
of
the
fig
again
greek
legend
told
how
pentheus
king
of
thebes
and
lycurgus
king
of
the
thracian
edonians
opposed
the
dionysus
and
how
the
impious
monarchs
were
rent
in
pieces
the
one
by
the
frenzied
bacchanals
the
other
by
horses
these
greek
traditions
may
well
be
distorted
reminiscences
of
a
custom
of
sacrificing
human
beings
and
especially
divine
kings
in
the
character
of
dionysus
a
god
who
resembled
osiris
in
many
points
and
was
said
like
him
to
have
been
torn
limb
from
limb
we
are
told
that
in
chios
men
were
rent
in
pieces
as
a
sacrifice
to
dionysus
and
since
they
died
the
same
death
as
their
god
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
they
personated
him
the
story
that
the
thracian
orpheus
was
similarly
torn
limb
from
limb
by
the
bacchanals
seems
to
indicate
that
he
too
perished
in
the
character
of
the
god
whose
death
he
died
it
is
significant
that
the
thracian
lycurgus
king
of
the
edonians
is
said
to
have
been
put
to
death
in
order
that
the
ground
which
had
ceased
to
be
fruitful
might
regain
its
fertility
in
some
thracian
villages
at
carnival
time
a
custom
is
still
annually
observed
which
may
well
be
a
mitigation
of
an
ancient
practice
of
putting
a
man
perhaps
a
king
to
death
in
the
character
of
dionysus
for
the
sake
of
the
crops
a
man
disguised
in
goatskins
and
fawnskins
the
livery
of
dionysus
is
shot
at
and
falls
down
as
dead
a
pretence
is
made
of
flaying
his
body
and
of
mourning
over
him
but
afterwards
he
comes
to
life
again
further
a
plough
is
dragged
about
the
village
and
seed
is
scattered
while
prayers
are
said
that
the
wheat
rye
and
barley
may
be
plentiful
one
town
viza
where
these
customs
are
observed
was
the
capital
of
the
old
thracian
kings
in
another
town
kosti
near
the
black
sea
the
principal
masker
is
called
the
king
he
wears
goatskins
or
sheepskins
and
is
attended
by
a
boy
who
dispenses
wine
to
the
people
the
king
himself
carries
seed
which
he
casts
on
the
ground
before
the
church
after
being
invited
to
throw
it
on
two
bands
of
married
and
unmarried
men
respectively
finally
he
is
stripped
of
the
skins
and
thrown
into
the
river
further
we
read
of
a
norwegian
king
halfdan
the
black
whose
body
was
cut
up
and
buried
in
different
parts
of
his
kingdom
for
the
sake
of
ensuring
the
fruitfulness
of
the
earth
he
is
said
to
have
been
drowned
at
the
age
of
forty
through
the
breaking
of
the
ice
in
spring
what
followed
his
death
is
thus
related
by
the
old
norse
historian
snorri
sturluson
he
had
been
the
most
prosperous
literally
blessed
with
abundance
of
all
kings
so
greatly
did
men
value
him
that
when
the
news
came
that
he
was
dead
and
his
body
removed
to
hringariki
and
intended
for
burial
there
the
chief
men
from
raumariki
and
westfold
and
heithmörk
came
and
all
requested
that
they
might
take
his
body
with
them
and
bury
it
in
their
various
provinces
they
thought
that
it
would
bring
abundance
to
those
who
obtained
it
eventually
it
was
settled
that
the
body
was
distributed
in
four
places
the
head
was
laid
in
a
barrow
at
steinn
in
hringariki
and
each
party
took
away
their
own
share
and
buried
it
all
these
barrows
are
called
halfdan
s
it
should
be
remembered
that
this
halfdan
belonged
to
the
family
of
the
ynglings
who
traced
their
descent
from
frey
the
great
scandinavian
god
of
fertility
frey
himself
is
said
to
have
reigned
as
king
of
sweden
at
upsala
the
years
of
his
reign
were
plenteous
and
the
people
laid
the
plenty
to
his
account
so
when
he
died
they
would
not
burn
him
as
it
had
been
customary
to
do
with
the
dead
before
his
time
but
they
resolved
to
preserve
his
body
believing
that
so
long
as
it
remained
in
sweden
the
land
would
have
abundance
and
peace
therefore
they
reared
a
great
mound
and
put
him
in
it
and
sacrificed
to
him
for
plenty
and
peace
ever
afterwards
and
for
three
years
after
his
death
they
poured
the
tribute
to
him
into
the
mound
as
if
he
were
alive
the
gold
they
poured
in
by
one
window
the
silver

the
copper

a
third
the
natives
of
kiwai
an
island
lying
off
the
mouth
of
the
fly
river
in
british
new
guinea
tell
of
a
certain
magician
named
segera
who
had
sago
for
his
totem
when
his
son
died
the
death
was
set
down
to
the
magic
of
an
enemy
and
the
bereaved
father
was
so
angry
that
by
his
spells
he
caused
the
whole
crop
of
sago
in
the
country
to
fail
only
in
his
own
garden
the
sago
grew
as
luxuriantly
as
ever
when
many
had
died
of
famine
the
people
went
to
him
and
begged
him
to
remove
the
spells
which
he
had
cast
on
the
sago
palms
so
that
they
might
eat
food
and
live
the
magician
touched
with
remorse
and
pity
went
round
planting
a
sago
shoot
in
every
garden
and
the
shoots
flourished
sago
was
plentiful
once
more
and
the
famine
came
to
an
end
when
segera
was
old
and
ill
he
told
the
people
that
he
would
soon
die
but
that
nevertheless
he
would
cause
their
gardens
to
thrive
accordingly
he
instructed
them
that
when
he
was
dead
they
should
cut
him
up
and
place
pieces
of
his
flesh
in
their
gardens
but
his
head
was
to
be
buried
in
his
own
garden
of
him
it
is
said
that
he
outlived
the
ordinary
age
and
that
no
man
knew
his
father
but
that
he
made
the
sago
good
and
no
one
was
hungry
any
more
old
men
who
were
alive
a
few
years
ago
affirmed
that
they
had
known
segera
in
their
youth
and
the
general
opinion
of
the
kiwai
people
seems
to
be
that
segera
died
not
more
than
two
generations
ago
taken
all
together
these
legends
point
to
a
widespread
practice
of
dismembering
the
body
of
a
king
or
magician
and
burying
the
pieces
in
different
parts
of
the
country
in
order
to
ensure
the
fertility
of
the
ground
and
probably
also
the
fecundity
of
man
and
beast
whether
regarded
as
the
descendant
of
a
god
as
himself
divine
or
simply
as
a
mighty
enchanter
the
king
was
believed
to
radiate
magical
virtue
for
the
good
of
his
subjects
quickening
the
seed
in
the
earth
and
in
the
womb
this
radiation
of
reproductive
energy
did
not
cease
with
his
life
hence
the
people
deemed
it
essential
to
preserve
his
body
as
a
pledge
of
the
continued
prosperity
of
the
country
it
would
be
natural
to
imagine
that
the
spot
where
the
dead
king
was
buried
would
enjoy
a
more
than
ordinary
share
of
his
blessed
influence
and
accordingly
disputes
would
almost
inevitably
arise
between
different
districts
for
the
exclusive
possession
of
so
powerful
a
talisman
these
disputes
could
be
settled
and
local
jealousies
appeased
by
dividing
the
precious
body
between
the
rival
claimants
in
order
that
all
should
benefit
in
equal
measure
by
its
properties
this
was
certainly
done
in
norway
with
the
body
of
halfdan
the
black
the
descendant
of
the
frey
it
appears
to
have
been
done
with
the
body
of
segera
the
of
kiwai
and
we
may
conjecture
that
in
prehistoric
times
it
was
done
with
the
bodies
of
egyptian
kings
who
personated
osiris
the
god
of
fertility
in
general
and
of
the
corn
in
particular
at
least
such
a
practice
would
account
for
the
legend
of
the
mangling
of
the
god
s
body
and
the
distribution
of
the
pieces
throughout
egypt
in
this
connexion
the
story
that
the
genital
member
of
osiris
was
missing
when
isis
pieced
together
his
mutilated
body
may
not
be
without
significance
when
a
zulu
wishes
to
make
the
crops
grow
well
he
will
take
the
body
of
a
man
who
has
died
in
full
vigour
and
cut
minute
portions
of
tissue
from
the
foot
the
leg
the
arm
the
face
and
the
nail
of
a
single
finger
in
order
to
compound
a
fertilizing
medicine
out
of
them
but
the
most
important
part
of
the
medicine
consists
of
the
dead
man
s
generative
organs
which
are
removed
entire
all
these
pieces
of
the
corpse
are
fried
with
herbs
on
a
slow
fire
then
ground
to
powder
and
sown
over
the
fields
we
have
seen
that
similarly
the
egyptians
scattered
the
ashes
of
human
victims
by
means
of
and
if
my
explanation
of
the
practice
is
correct
it
may
well
have
been
that
they
like
the
zulus
attributed
a
special
power
of
reproduction
to
the
genital
organs
and
therefore
carefully
excised
them
from
the
body
of
the
victim
in
order
to
impart
their
virtue
to
the
fields
i
have
conjectured
that
a
similar
use
was
made
of
the
severed
portions
of
the
priests
of
attis
to
an
ancient
egyptian
with
his
firm
belief
in
a
personal
immortality
dependent
on
the
integrity
of
the
body
the
prospect
of
mutilation
after
death
must
have
been
very
repugnant
and
we
may
suppose
that
the
kings
offered
a
strenuous
resistance
to
the
custom
and
finally
succeeded
in
abolishing
it
they
may
have
represented
to
the
people
that
they
would
attain
their
object
better
by
keeping
the
royal
corpse
intact
than
by
frittering
it
away
in
small
pieces
their
subjects
apparently
acquiesced
in
the
argument
or
at
all
events
in
the
conclusion
yet
the
mountains
of
masonry
beneath
which
the
old
egyptian
kings
lay
buried
may
have
been
intended
to
guard
them
from
the
superstitious
devotion
of
their
friends
quite
as
much
as
from
the
hostile
designs
of
their
enemies
since
both
alike
must
have
been
under
a
strong
temptation
to
violate
the
sanctity
of
the
grave
in
order
to
possess
themselves
of
bodies
which
were
believed
to
be
endowed
with
magical
virtue
of
the
most
tremendous
potency
in
antiquity
the
safety
of
the
state
was
often
believed
to
depend
on
the
possession
of
a
talisman
which
sometimes
consisted
of
the
bones
of
a
king
or
hero
hence
the
graves
of
such
persons
were
sometimes
kept
secret
the
violation
of
royal
tombs
by
a
conqueror
was
not
a
mere
insult
it
was
a
deadly
blow
struck
at
the
prosperity
of
the
kingdom
hence
ashurbanipal
carried
off
to
assyria
the
bones
of
the
kings
of
elam
believing
that
thus
he
gave
their
shades
no
repose
and
deprived
them
of
food
and
drink
the
moabites
burned
the
bones
of
the
king
of
edom
into
lime
lysimachus
is
said
to
have
opened
the
graves
of
the
kings
of
epirus
and
scattered
the
bones
of
the
dead
with
savage
and
barbarous
tribes
in
like
manner
it
is
not
unusual
to
violate
the
sanctity
of
the
tomb
either
for
the
purpose
of
wreaking
vengeance
on
the
dead
or
more
commonly
perhaps
for
the
sake
of
gaining
possession
of
the
bones
and
converting
them
to
magical
uses
hence
the
mpongwe
kings
of
the
gaboon
region
in
west
africa
are
buried
secretly
lest
their
heads
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
men
of
another
tribe
who
would
make
a
powerful
fetish
out
of
the
brains
again
in
togoland
west
africa
the
kings
of
the
ho
tribe
are
buried
with
great
secrecy
in
the
forest
and
a
false
grave
is
made
ostentatiously
in
the
king
s
house
none
but
his
personal
retainers
and
a
single
daughter
know
where
the
king
s
real
grave
is
the
intention
of
this
secret
burial
is
to
prevent
enemies
from
digging
up
the
corpse
and
cutting
off
the
head
the
heads
of
important
chiefs
in
the
calabar
districts
are
usually
cut
off
from
the
body
on
burial
and
kept
secretly
for
fear
the
head
and
thereby
the
spirit
of
the
dead
chief
should
be
stolen
from
the
town
if
it
were
stolen
it
would
be
not
only
a
great
advantage
to
its
new
possessor
but
a
great
danger
to
the
chief
s
old
town
because
he
would
know
all
the
peculiar
relating
to
it
for
each
town
has
a
peculiar
one
kept
exceedingly
secret
in
addition
to
the
general
and
this
secret
one
would
then
be
in
the
hands
of
the
new
owners
of
the
the
graves
of
basuto
chiefs
are
kept
secret
lest
certain
more
or
less
imaginary
witches
and
wizards
called
who
haunt
tombs
should
get
possession
of
the
bones
and
work
evil
magic
with
them
in
the
thonga
tribe
of
south
africa
when
a
chief
dies
he
is
buried
secretly
by
night
in
a
sacred
wood
and
few
people
know
the
place
of
the
grave
with
some
clans
of
the
tribe
it
is
customary
to
level
the
mound
over
the
grave
so
that
no
sign
whatever
remains
to
show
where
the
body
has
been
buried
this
is
said
to
be
done
lest
enemies
should
exhume
the
corpse
and
cut
off
the
ears
the
diaphragm
and
other
parts
in
order
to
make
powerful
out
of
them
by
many
tribes
in
fiji
the
of
their
chief
is
kept
a
profound
secret
lest
those
whom
he
injured
during
his
lifetime
should
revenge
themselves
by
digging
up
and
insulting
or
even
eating
his
body
in
some
places
the
dead
chief
is
buried
in
his
own
house
and
armed
warriors
of
his
mother
s
kin
keep
watch
night
and
day
over
his
grave
after
a
time
his
bones
are
taken
up
and
carried
by
night
to
some
inaccessible
cave
in
the
mountains
whose
position
is
known
only
to
a
few
trustworthy
men
ladders
are
constructed
to
enable
them
to
reach
the
cave
and
are
taken
down
when
the
bones
have
been
deposited
there
many
frightful
stories
are
told
in
connection
with
this
custom
and
it
is
certain
that
not
even
decomposition
itself
avails
to
baulk
the
last
revenge
of
cannibals
if
they
can
find
the
grave
the
very
bones
of
the
dead
chief
are
not
secure
from
the
revenge
of
those
whose
friends
he
killed
during
his
lifetime
or
whom
he
otherwise
so
exasperated
by
the
tyrannous
exercise
of
his
power
as
to
fill
their
hearts
with
a
deadly
hate
in
one
instance
within
my
own
knowledge
when
the
was
discovered
the
bones
were
taken
away
scraped
and
stewed
down
into
a
horrible
when
a
melanesian
dies
who
enjoyed
a
reputation
for
magical
powers
in
his
lifetime
his
friends
will
sometimes
hold
a
sham
burial
and
keep
the
real
grave
secret
for
fear
that
men
might
come
and
dig
up
the
skull
and
bones
to
make
charms
with
them
beliefs
and
practices
of
this
sort
are
by
no
means
confined
to
agricultural
peoples
among
the
koniags
of
alaska
in
ancient
times
the
pursuit
of
the
whale
was
accompanied
by
numerous
superstitious
observances
kept
a
secret
by
the
hunters
lieutenant
davidof
states
that
the
whalers
preserved
the
bodies
of
brave
or
distinguished
men
in
secluded
caves
and
before
proceeding
upon
a
would
carry
these
dead
bodies
into
a
stream
and
then
drink
of
the
water
thus
tainted
one
famous
whaler
of
kadiak
who
desired
to
flatter
baranof
the
first
chief
manager
of
the
russian
colonies
said
to
him
when
you
die
i
shall
try
to
steal
your
body
intending
thus
to
express
his
great
respect
for
baranof
on
the
occasion
of
the
death
of
a
whaler
his
fellows
would
cut
the
body
into
pieces
each
man
taking
one
of
them
for
the
purpose
of
rubbing
his
therewith
these
pieces
were
dried
or
otherwise
preserved
and
were
frequently
taken
into
the
canoes
as
to
return
to
the
human
victims
whose
ashes
the
egyptians
scattered
with
the
red
hair
of
these
unfortunates
was
probably
significant
if
i
am
right
the
custom
of
sacrificing
such
persons
was
not
a
mere
way
of
wreaking
a
national
spite
on
foreigners
whom
the
egyptians
of
old
like
the
chinese
of
modern
times
may
have
regarded
as
devils
for
in
egypt
the
oxen
which
were
sacrificed
had
also
to
be
red
a
single
black
or
white
hair
found
on
the
beast
would
have
disqualified
it
for
the
sacrifice
if
as
i
conjecture
these
human
sacrifices
were
intended
to
promote
the
growth
of
the
the
winnowing
of
their
ashes
seems
to
support
this
victims
were
perhaps
selected
as
best
fitted
to
personate
the
spirit
of
the
ruddy
grain
for
when
a
god
is
represented
by
a
living
person
it
is
natural
that
the
human
representative
should
be
chosen
on
the
ground
of
his
supposed
resemblance
to
the
divine
original
hence
the
ancient
mexicans
conceiving
the
maize
as
a
personal
being
who
went
through
the
whole
course
of
life
between
and
harvest
sacrificed
babes
when
the
maize
was
sown
older
children
when
it
had
sprouted
and
so
on
till
it
was
fully
ripe
when
they
sacrificed
old
men
a
name
for
osiris
was
the
crop
or
harvest
and
the
ancients
sometimes
explained
him
as
a
personification
of
the
corn
osiris
a
but
osiris
was
more
than
a
spirit
of
the
corn
he
was
also
a
and
this
may
perhaps
have
been
his
primitive
character
since
the
worship
of
trees
is
naturally
older
in
the
history
of
religion
than
the
worship
of
the
cereals
however
that
may
have
been
to
an
agricultural
people
like
the
egyptians
who
depended
almost
wholly
on
their
crops
the
was
naturally
a
far
more
important
personage
than
the
and
attracted
a
larger
share
of
their
devotion
the
character
of
osiris
as
a
was
represented
very
graphically
in
a
ceremony
described
by
firmicus
maternus
a
having
been
cut
down
the
centre
was
hollowed
out
and
with
the
wood
thus
excavated
an
image
of
osiris
was
made
which
was
then
buried
like
a
corpse
in
the
hollow
of
the
tree
it
is
hard
to
imagine
how
the
conception
of
a
tree
as
tenanted
by
a
personal
being
could
be
more
plainly
expressed
the
image
of
osiris
thus
made
was
kept
for
a
year
and
then
burned
exactly
as
was
done
with
the
image
of
attis
which
was
attached
to
the
the
ceremony
of
cutting
the
tree
as
described
by
firmicus
maternus
appears
to
be
alluded
to
by
plutarch
it
was
probably
the
ritual
counterpart
of
the
mythical
discovery
of
the
body
of
osiris
enclosed
in
the
now
we
know
from
the
monuments
that
at
busiris
memphis
and
elsewhere
the
great
festival
of
osiris
closed
on
the
thirtieth
of
khoiak
with
the
setting
up
of
a
remarkable
pillar
known
as
the
or
this
was
a
column
with
four
or
five
like
superposed
capitals
at
the
top
the
whole
roughly
resembled
a
with
the
which
support
the
wires
sometimes
on
the
monuments
a
human
form
is
given
to
the
pillar
by
carving
a
grotesque
face
on
it
robing
the
lower
part
crowning
the
top
with
the
symbols
of
osiris
and
adding
two
arms
which
hold
two
other
characteristic
emblems
of
the
god
the
crook
and
the
scourge
or
flail
on
a
theban
tomb
the
king
himself
assisted
by
his
relations
and
a
priest
is
represented
hauling
at
the
ropes
by
which
the
pillar
is
being
raised
while
the
queen
looks
on
and
her
sixteen
daughters
accompany
the
ceremony
with
the
music
of
rattles
and
sistrums
again
in
the
hall
of
the
osirian
mysteries
at
abydos
the
king
sety
and
the
goddess
isis
are
depicted
raising
the
column
between
them
in
egyptian
theology
the
pillar
was
interpreted
as
the
backbone
of
osiris
and
whatever
its
meaning
may
have
been
it
was
one
of
the
holiest
symbols
of
the
national
religion
it
might
very
well
be
a
conventional
way
of
representing
a
tree
stripped
of
its
leaves
and
if
osiris
was
a
the
bare
trunk
and
branches
might
naturally
be
described
as
his
backbone
the
setting
up
of
the
column
would
thus
as
several
modern
scholars
believe
shadow
forth
the
resurrection
of
the
god
and
the
importance
of
the
occasion
would
explain
and
justify
the
prominent
part
which
the
king
appears
to
have
taken
in
the
ceremony
it
is
to
be
noted
that
in
the
myth
of
osiris
the
which
shot
up
and
enclosed
his
dead
body
was
cut
down
by
a
king
and
turned
by
him
into
a
pillar
of
his
house
we
can
hardly
doubt
therefore
that
this
incident
of
the
legend
was
supposed
to
be
dramatically
set
forth
in
the
erection
of
the
column
by
the
king
like
the
similar
custom
of
cutting
a
and
fastening
an
image
to
it
in
the
rites
of
attis
the
ceremony
may
have
belonged
to
that
class
of
customs
of
which
the
bringing
in
of
the
is
among
the
most
familiar
the
association
of
the
king
and
queen
of
egypt
with
the
pillar
reminds
us
of
the
association
of
a
king
and
queen
of
may
with
the
the
resemblance
may
be
more
than
superficial
in
the
hall
of
osiris
at
denderah
the
coffin
containing
the
mummy
of
the
god
is
clearly
depicted
as
enclosed
within
a
tree
apparently
a
conifer
the
trunk
and
branches
of
which
are
seen
above
and
below
the
coffin
the
scene
thus
corresponds
closely
both
to
the
myth
and
to
the
ceremony
described
by
firmicus
maternus
in
another
scene
at
denderah
a
tree
of
the
same
sort
is
represented
growing
between
the
dead
and
the
reviving
osiris
as
if
on
purpose
to
indicate
that
the
tree
was
the
symbol
of
the
divine
resurrection
a
often
appears
on
the
monuments
as
an
offering
presented
to
osiris
and
a
manuscript
of
the
louvre
speaks
of
the
cedar
as
sprung
from
him
the
sycamore
and
the
tamarisk
were
also
his
trees
in
inscriptions
he
is
spoken
of
as
residing
in
them
and
in
tombs
his
mother
nut
is
often
portrayed
standing
in
the
midst
of
a
and
pouring
a
libation
for
the
benefit
of
the
dead
in
one
of
the
pyramid
texts
we
read
hail
to
thee
sycamore
which
enclosest
the
god
and
in
certain
temples
the
statue
of
osiris
used
to
be
placed
for
seven
days
upon
branches
of
sycamores
the
explanation
appended
in
the
sacred
texts
declares
that
the
placing
of
the
image
on
the
tree
was
intended
to
recall
the
seven
months
passed
by
osiris
in
the
womb
of
his
mother
nut
the
goddess
of
the
sycamore
the
rite
recalls
the
story
that
adonis
was
born
after
ten
months
gestation
from
a
further
in
a
sepulchre
at
how
diospolis
parva
a
tamarisk
is
depicted
overshadowing
the
tomb
of
osiris
while
a
bird
is
perched
among
the
branches
with
the
significant
legend
the
soul
of
osiris
showing
that
the
spirit
of
the
dead
god
was
believed
to
haunt
his
sacred
tree
again
in
the
series
of
sculptures
which
illustrate
the
mystic
history
of
osiris
in
the
great
temple
of
isis
at
philae
a
tamarisk
is
figured
with
two
men
pouring
water
on
it
the
accompanying
inscription
leaves
no
doubt
says
brugsch
that
the
verdure
of
the
earth
was
believed
to
be
connected
with
the
verdure
of
the
tree
and
that
the
sculpture
refers
to
the
grave
of
osiris
at
philae
of
which
plutarch
tells
us
that
it
was
overshadowed
by
a
plant
taller
than
any
this
sculpture
it
may
be
observed
occurs
in
the
same
chamber
in
which
the
god
is
represented
as
a
corpse
with
ears
of
corn
springing
from
him
in
inscriptions
he
is
referred
to
as
the
one
in
the
tree
the
solitary
one
in
the
acacia
and
so
forth
on
the
monuments
he
sometimes
appears
as
a
mummy
covered
with
a
tree
or
with
plants
and
trees
are
represented
growing
from
his
grave
it
accords
with
the
character
of
osiris
as
a
that
his
worshippers
were
forbidden
to
injure
and
with
his
character
as
a
god
of
vegetation
in
general
that
they
were
not
allowed
to
stop
up
wells
of
water
which
are
so
important
for
the
irrigation
of
hot
southern
lands
according
to
one
legend
he
taught
men
to
train
the
vine
to
poles
to
prune
its
superfluous
foliage
and
to
extract
the
juice
of
the
grape
in
the
papyrus
of
nebseni
written
about
osiris
is
depicted
sitting
in
a
shrine
from
the
roof
of
which
hang
clusters
of
grapes
and
in
the
papyrus
of
the
royal
scribe
nekht
we
see
the
god
enthroned
in
front
of
a
pool
from
the
banks
of
which
a
luxuriant
vine
with
many
bunches
of
grapes
grows
towards
the
green
face
of
the
seated
deity
the
ivy
was
sacred
to
him
and
was
called
his
plant
because
it
is
always
green
osiris
a
god
of
fertility
as
a
god
of
vegetation
osiris
was
naturally
conceived
as
a
god
of
creative
energy
in
general
since
men
at
a
certain
stage
of
evolution
fail
to
distinguish
between
the
reproductive
powers
of
animals
and
of
plants
hence
a
striking
feature
in
his
worship
was
the
coarse
but
expressive
symbolism
by
which
this
aspect
of
his
nature
was
presented
to
the
eye
not
merely
of
the
initiated
but
of
the
multitude
at
his
festival
women
used
to
go
about
the
villages
singing
songs
in
his
praise
and
carrying
obscene
images
of
him
which
they
set
in
motion
by
means
of
strings
the
custom
was
probably
a
charm
to
ensure
the
growth
of
the
crops
a
similar
image
of
him
decked
with
all
the
fruits
of
the
earth
is
said
to
have
stood
in
a
temple
before
a
figure
of
isis
and
in
the
chambers
dedicated
to
him
at
philae
the
dead
god
is
portrayed
lying
on
his
bier
in
an
attitude
which
indicates
in
the
plainest
way
that
even
in
death
his
generative
virtue
was
not
extinct
but
only
suspended
ready
to
prove
a
source
of
life
and
fertility
to
the
world
when
the
opportunity
should
offer
hymns
addressed
to
osiris
contain
allusions
to
this
important
side
of
his
nature
in
one
of
them
it
is
said
that
the
world
waxes
green
in
triumph
through
him
and
another
declares
thou
art
the
father
and
mother
of
mankind
they
live
on
thy
breath
they
subsist
on
the
flesh
of
thy
we
may
conjecture
that
in
this
paternal
aspect
he
was
supposed
like
other
gods
of
fertility
to
bless
men
and
women
with
offspring
and
that
the
processions
at
his
festival
were
intended
to
promote
this
object
as
well
as
to
quicken
the
seed
in
the
ground
it
would
be
to
misjudge
ancient
religion
to
denounce
as
lewd
and
profligate
the
emblems
and
the
ceremonies
which
the
egyptians
employed
for
the
purpose
of
giving
effect
to
this
conception
of
the
divine
power
the
ends
which
they
proposed
to
themselves
in
these
rites
were
natural
and
laudable
only
the
means
they
adopted
to
compass
them
were
mistaken
a
similar
fallacy
induced
the
greeks
to
adopt
a
like
symbolism
in
their
dionysiac
festivals
and
the
superficial
but
striking
resemblance
thus
produced
between
the
two
religions
has
perhaps
more
than
anything
else
misled
inquirers
both
ancient
and
modern
into
identifying
worships
which
though
certainly
akin
in
nature
are
perfectly
distinct
and
independent
in
origin
osiris
a
god
of
the
dead
we
have
seen
that
in
one
of
his
aspects
osiris
was
the
ruler
and
judge
of
the
dead
to
a
people
like
the
egyptians
who
not
only
believed
in
a
life
beyond
the
grave
but
actually
spent
much
of
their
time
labour
and
money
in
preparing
for
it
this
office
of
the
god
must
have
appeared
hardly
if
at
all
less
important
than
his
function
of
making
the
earth
to
bring
forth
its
fruits
in
due
season
we
may
assume
that
in
the
faith
of
his
worshippers
the
two
provinces
of
the
god
were
intimately
connected
in
laying
their
dead
in
the
grave
they
committed
them
to
his
keeping
who
could
raise
them
from
the
dust
to
life
eternal
even
as
he
caused
the
seed
to
spring
from
the
ground
of
that
faith
the
effigies
of
osiris
found
in
egyptian
tombs
furnish
an
eloquent
and
unequivocal
testimony
they
were
at
once
an
emblem
and
an
instrument
of
resurrection
thus
from
the
sprouting
of
the
grain
the
ancient
egyptians
drew
an
augury
of
human
immortality
they
are
not
the
only
people
who
have
built
the
same
hopes
on
the
same
slender
foundation
thou
fool
that
which
thou
sowest
thou
sowest
not
that
body
that
shall
be
but
bare
grain
it
may
chance
of
wheat
or
of
some
other
grain
but
god
giveth
it
a
body
as
it
hath
pleased
him
and
to
every
seed
his
own
body
so
also
is
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
it
is
sown
in
corruption
it
is
raised
in
incorruption
it
is
sown
in
weakness
it
is
raised
in
power
it
is
sown
a
natural
body
it
is
raised
a
spiritual
a
god
who
thus
fed
his
people
with
his
own
broken
body
in
this
life
and
who
held
out
to
them
a
promise
of
a
blissful
eternity
in
a
better
world
hereafter
naturally
reigned
supreme
in
their
affections
we
need
not
wonder
therefore
that
in
egypt
the
worship
of
the
other
gods
was
overshadowed
by
that
of
osiris
and
that
while
they
were
revered
each
in
his
own
district
he
and
his
divine
partner
isis
were
adored
in
all
chapter
vi
isis
the
original
meaning
of
the
goddess
isis
is
still
more
difficult
to
determine
than
that
of
her
brother
and
husband
osiris
her
attributes
and
epithets
were
so
numerous
that
in
the
hieroglyphics
she
is
called
the
the
and
in
greek
inscriptions
the
the
late
eminent
dutch
scholar
tiele
confessed
candidly
that
it
is
now
impossible
to
tell
precisely
to
what
natural
phenomena
the
character
of
isis
at
first
yet
he
adds
originally
she
was
a
goddess
of
similarly
budge
writes
that
isis
was
the
great
and
beneficent
goddess
and
mother
whose
influence
and
love
pervaded
all
heaven
and
earth
and
the
abode
of
the
dead
and
she
was
the
personification
of
the
great
feminine
creative
power
which
conceived
and
brought
forth
every
living
creature
and
thing
from
the
gods
in
heaven
to
man
on
the
earth
and
to
the
insect
on
the
ground
what
she
brought
forth
she
protected
and
cared
for
and
fed
and
nourished
and
she
employed
her
life
in
using
her
power
graciously
and
successfully
not
only
in
creating
new
beings
but
in
restoring
those
that
were
dead
she
was
besides
these
things
the
highest
type
of
a
faithful
and
loving
wife
and
mother
and
it
was
in
this
capacity
that
the
egyptians
honoured
and
worshipped
her
thus
in
her
character
of
a
goddess
of
fecundity
isis
answered
to
the
great
mother
goddesses
of
asia
though
she
differed
from
them
in
the
chastity
and
fidelity
of
her
conjugal
life
for
while
they
were
unmarried
and
dissolute
she
had
a
husband
and
was
a
true
wife
to
him
as
well
as
an
affectionate
mother
to
their
son
hence
her
beautiful
figure
reflects
a
more
refined
state
of
society
and
of
morals
than
the
coarse
sensual
cruel
figures
of
astarte
anaitis
cybele
and
the
rest
of
that
crew
a
clear
trace
indeed
of
an
ethical
standard
very
different
from
our
own
lingers
in
her
double
relation
of
sister
and
wife
to
osiris
but
in
most
other
respects
she
is
rather
late
than
primitive
the
flower
rather
than
the
seed
of
a
long
religious
development
the
attributes
ascribed
to
her
were
too
various
to
be
all
her
own
they
were
graces
borrowed
from
many
lesser
deities
sweets
rifled
from
a
thousand
humbler
plants
to
feed
the
honey
of
her
superb
efflorescence
yet
in
her
complex
nature
it
is
perhaps
still
possible
to
detect
the
original
nucleus
round
which
by
a
slow
process
of
accretion
the
other
elements
gathered
for
if
her
brother
and
husband
osiris
was
in
one
of
his
aspects
the
as
we
have
seen
reason
to
believe
she
must
surely
have
been
the
there
are
at
least
some
grounds
for
thinking
so
for
if
we
may
trust
diodorus
siculus
whose
authority
appears
to
have
been
the
egyptian
historian
manetho
the
discovery
of
wheat
and
barley
was
attributed
to
isis
and
at
her
festivals
stalks
of
these
grains
were
carried
in
procession
to
commemorate
the
boon
she
had
conferred
on
men
a
further
detail
is
added
by
augustine
he
says
that
isis
made
the
discovery
of
barley
at
the
moment
when
she
was
sacrificing
to
the
common
ancestors
of
her
husband
and
herself
all
of
whom
had
been
kings
and
that
she
showed
the
newly
discovered
ears
of
barley
to
osiris
and
his
councillor
thoth
or
mercury
as
roman
writers
called
him
that
is
why
adds
augustine
they
identify
isis
with
ceres
further
at
when
the
egyptian
reapers
had
cut
the
first
stalks
they
laid
them
down
and
beat
their
breasts
wailing
and
calling
upon
isis
the
custom
has
been
already
explained
as
a
lament
for
the
slain
under
the
sickle
amongst
the
epithets
by
which
isis
is
designated
in
the
inscriptions
are
creatress
of
green
things
green
goddess
whose
green
colour
is
like
unto
the
greenness
of
the
earth
lady
of
bread
lady
of
beer
lady
of
according
to
brugsch
she
is
not
only
the
creatress
of
the
fresh
verdure
of
vegetation
which
covers
the
earth
but
is
actually
the
green
itself
which
is
personified
as
a
this
is
confirmed
by
her
epithet
or
meaning
a
a
sense
which
the
word
still
retains
in
coptic
the
greeks
conceived
of
isis
as
a
for
they
identified
her
with
demeter
in
a
greek
epigram
she
is
described
as
she
who
has
given
birth
to
the
fruits
of
the
earth
and
the
mother
of
the
ears
of
corn
and
in
a
hymn
composed
in
her
honour
she
speaks
of
herself
as
queen
of
the
and
is
described
as
charged
with
the
care
of
the
fruitful
furrow
s
accordingly
greek
or
roman
artists
often
represented
her
with
ears
of
corn
on
her
head
or
in
her
hand
such
we
may
suppose
was
isis
in
the
olden
time
a
rustic
adored
with
uncouth
rites
by
egyptian
swains
but
the
homely
features
of
the
clownish
goddess
could
hardly
be
traced
in
the
refined
the
saintly
form
which
spiritualized
by
ages
of
religious
evolution
she
presented
to
her
worshippers
of
after
days
as
the
true
wife
the
tender
mother
the
beneficent
queen
of
nature
encircled
with
the
nimbus
of
moral
purity
of
immemorial
and
mysterious
sanctity
thus
chastened
and
transfigured
she
won
many
hearts
far
beyond
the
boundaries
of
her
native
land
in
that
welter
of
religions
which
accompanied
the
decline
of
national
life
in
antiquity
her
worship
was
one
of
the
most
popular
at
rome
and
throughout
the
empire
some
of
the
roman
emperors
themselves
were
openly
addicted
to
it
and
however
the
religion
of
isis
may
like
any
other
have
been
often
worn
as
a
cloak
by
men
and
women
of
loose
life
her
rites
appear
on
the
whole
to
have
been
honourably
distinguished
by
a
dignity
and
composure
a
solemnity
and
decorum
well
fitted
to
soothe
the
troubled
mind
to
ease
the
burdened
heart
they
appealed
therefore
to
gentle
spirits
and
above
all
to
women
whom
the
bloody
and
licentious
rites
of
other
oriental
goddesses
only
shocked
and
repelled
we
need
not
wonder
then
that
in
a
period
of
decadence
when
traditional
faiths
were
shaken
when
systems
clashed
when
men
s
minds
were
disquieted
when
the
fabric
of
empire
itself
once
deemed
eternal
began
to
show
ominous
rents
and
fissures
the
serene
figure
of
isis
with
her
spiritual
calm
her
gracious
promise
of
immortality
should
have
appeared
to
many
like
a
star
in
a
stormy
sky
and
should
have
roused
in
their
breasts
a
rapture
of
devotion
not
unlike
that
which
was
paid
in
the
middle
ages
to
the
virgin
mary
indeed
her
stately
ritual
with
its
shaven
and
tonsured
priests
its
matins
and
vespers
its
tinkling
music
its
baptism
and
aspersions
of
holy
water
its
solemn
processions
its
jewelled
images
of
the
mother
of
god
presented
many
points
of
similarity
to
the
pomps
and
ceremonies
of
catholicism
the
resemblance
need
not
be
purely
accidental
ancient
egypt
may
have
contributed
its
share
to
the
gorgeous
symbolism
of
the
catholic
church
as
well
as
to
the
pale
abstractions
of
her
theology
certainly
in
art
the
figure
of
isis
suckling
the
infant
horus
is
so
like
that
of
the
madonna
and
child
that
it
has
sometimes
received
the
adoration
of
ignorant
christians
and
to
isis
in
her
later
character
of
patroness
of
mariners
the
virgin
mary
perhaps
owes
her
beautiful
epithet
of
star
of
the
sea
under
which
she
is
adored
by
sailors
the
attributes
of
a
marine
deity
may
have
been
bestowed
on
isis
by
the
greeks
of
alexandria
they
are
quite
foreign
to
her
original
character
and
to
the
habits
of
the
egyptians
who
had
no
love
of
the
sea
on
this
hypothesis
sirius
the
bright
star
of
isis
which
on
july
mornings
rises
from
the
glassy
waves
of
the
eastern
mediterranean
a
harbinger
of
halcyon
weather
to
mariners
was
the
true
the
star
of
the
chapter
vii
osiris
and
the
sun
osiris
has
been
sometimes
interpreted
as
the
and
in
modern
times
this
view
has
been
held
by
so
many
distinguished
writers
that
it
deserves
a
brief
examination
if
we
inquire
on
what
evidence
osiris
has
been
identified
with
the
sun
or
the
it
will
be
found
on
analysis
to
be
minute
in
quantity
and
dubious
where
it
is
not
absolutely
worthless
in
quality
the
diligent
jablonski
the
first
modern
scholar
to
collect
and
sift
the
testimony
of
classical
writers
on
egyptian
religion
says
that
it
can
be
shown
in
many
ways
that
osiris
is
the
sun
and
that
he
could
produce
a
cloud
of
witnesses
to
prove
it
but
that
it
is
needless
to
do
so
since
no
learned
man
is
ignorant
of
the
fact
of
the
writers
whom
he
condescends
to
quote
the
only
two
who
expressly
identify
osiris
with
the
sun
are
diodorus
and
macrobius
the
passage
in
diodorus
runs
thus
it
is
said
that
the
aboriginal
inhabitants
of
egypt
looking
up
to
the
sky
and
smitten
with
awe
and
wonder
at
the
nature
of
the
universe
supposed
that
there
were
two
gods
eternal
and
primaeval
the
sun
and
the
moon
of
whom
they
named
the
sun
osiris
and
the
moon
even
if
diodorus
s
authority
for
this
statement
is
manetho
as
there
is
some
ground
for
believing
little
or
no
weight
can
be
attached
to
it
for
it
is
plainly
a
philosophical
and
therefore
a
late
explanation
of
the
first
beginnings
of
egyptian
religion
reminding
us
of
kant
s
familiar
saying
about
the
starry
heavens
and
the
moral
law
rather
than
of
the
rude
traditions
of
a
primitive
people
jablonski
s
second
authority
macrobius
is
no
better
but
rather
worse
for
macrobius
was
the
father
of
that
large
family
of
mythologists
who
resolve
all
or
most
gods
into
the
sun
according
to
him
mercury
was
the
sun
mars
was
the
sun
janus
was
the
sun
saturn
was
the
sun
so
was
jupiter
also
nemesis
likewise
pan
and
so
on
through
a
great
part
of
the
pantheon
it
was
natural
therefore
that
he
should
identify
osiris
with
the
sun
but
his
reasons
for
doing
so
are
exceedingly
slight
he
refers
to
the
ceremonies
of
alternate
lamentation
and
joy
as
if
they
reflected
the
vicissitudes
of
the
great
luminary
in
his
course
through
the
sky
further
he
argues
that
osiris
must
be
the
sun
because
an
eye
was
one
of
his
symbols
it
is
true
that
an
eye
was
a
symbol
of
osiris
and
it
is
also
true
that
the
sun
was
often
called
the
eye
of
horus
yet
the
coincidence
hardly
suffices
to
establish
the
identity
of
the
two
deities
the
opinion
that
osiris
was
the
sun
is
also
mentioned
but
not
accepted
by
plutarch
and
it
is
referred
to
by
firmicus
maternus
amongst
modern
scholars
lepsius
in
identifying
osiris
with
the
sun
appears
to
rely
mainly
on
the
passage
of
diodorus
already
quoted
but
the
monuments
he
adds
also
show
that
down
to
a
late
time
osiris
was
sometimes
conceived
as
in
this
quality
he
is
named
even
in
the
book
of
the
dead
and
isis
is
often
called
the
royal
consort
of
that
ra
was
both
the
physical
sun
and
the
is
undisputed
but
with
every
deference
for
the
authority
of
so
great
a
scholar
as
lepsius
we
may
doubt
whether
the
identification
of
osiris
with
ra
can
be
accepted
as
proof
that
osiris
was
originally
the
sun
for
the
religion
of
ancient
egypt
may
be
described
as
a
confederacy
of
local
cults
which
while
maintaining
against
each
other
a
certain
measure
of
jealous
and
even
hostile
independence
were
yet
constantly
subjected
to
the
fusing
and
amalgamating
influence
of
political
centralization
and
philosophic
thought
the
history
of
the
religion
appears
to
have
largely
consisted
of
a
struggle
between
these
opposite
forces
or
tendencies
on
the
one
side
there
was
the
conservative
tendency
to
preserve
the
local
cults
with
all
their
distinctive
features
fresh
sharp
and
crisp
as
they
had
been
handed
down
from
an
immemorial
past
on
the
other
side
there
was
the
progressive
tendency
favoured
by
the
gradual
fusion
of
the
people
under
a
powerful
central
government
first
to
dull
the
edge
of
these
provincial
distinctions
and
finally
to
break
them
down
completely
and
merge
them
in
a
single
national
religion
the
conservative
party
probably
mustered
in
its
ranks
the
great
bulk
of
the
people
their
prejudices
and
affections
being
warmly
enlisted
in
favour
of
the
local
deity
with
whose
temple
and
rites
they
had
been
familiar
from
childhood
and
the
popular
dislike
of
change
based
on
the
endearing
effect
of
old
association
must
have
been
strongly
reinforced
by
the
less
disinterested
opposition
of
the
local
clergy
whose
material
interests
would
necessarily
suffer
with
any
decay
of
their
shrines
on
the
other
hand
the
kings
whose
power
and
glory
rose
with
the
political
and
ecclesiastical
consolidation
of
the
realm
were
the
natural
champions
of
religious
unity
and
their
efforts
would
be
seconded
by
the
refined
and
thoughtful
minority
who
could
hardly
fail
to
be
shocked
by
the
many
barbarous
and
revolting
elements
in
the
local
rites
as
usually
happens
in
such
cases
the
process
of
religious
unification
appears
to
have
been
largely
effected
by
discovering
points
of
similarity
real
or
imaginary
between
the
provincial
deities
which
were
thereupon
declared
to
be
only
different
names
or
manifestations
of
the
same
god
of
the
deities
who
thus
acted
as
centres
of
attraction
absorbing
in
themselves
a
multitude
of
minor
divinities
by
far
the
most
important
was
the
ra
there
appear
to
have
been
few
gods
in
egypt
who
were
not
at
one
time

horus

the
east

were
regarded
as
one

even
the
sobk
in
spite
of
his
crocodile
shape
did
not
escape
the
same
fate
indeed
one
king
amenophis
undertook
to
sweep
away
all
the
old
gods
at
a
stroke
and
replace
them
by
a
single
god
the
great
living
disc

composed
in
his
honour

deity
is
referred
to
as
the
living

is
said
to
have
made
the
far

when
he
showeth

at

and
are
drunken
at
his
sight
all

that
are
in

marsh
flutter
for
it
is
he
who
bringeth
the
years
createth
the
months
maketh

the
lord
of
time
by
whom
men
in
his
zeal
for
the
unity
of
god
the
king
commanded
to
erase
the
names
of
all
other
gods
from
the
monuments
and
to
destroy
their
images
his
rage
was
particularly
directed
against
the
god
ammon
whose
name
and
likeness
were
effaced
wherever
they
were
found
even
the
sanctity
of
the
tomb
was
violated
in
order
to
destroy
the
memorials
of
the
hated
deity
in
some
of
the
halls
of
the
great
temples
at
carnac
luxor
and
other
places
all
the
names
of
the
gods
with
a
few
chance
exceptions
were
scratched
out
the
monarch
even
changed
his
own
name
amenophis
because
it
was
compounded
of
ammon
and
took
instead
the
name
of
gleam
of
the
sun
s
thebes
itself
the
ancient
capital
of
his
glorious
ancestors
full
of
the
monuments
of
their
piety
and
idolatry
was
no
longer
a
fit
home
for
the
puritan
king
he
deserted
it
and
built
for
himself
a
new
capital
in
middle
egypt
at
the
place
now
known
as
here
in
a
few
years
a
city
of
palaces
and
gardens
rose
like
an
exhalation
at
his
command
and
here
the
king
his
dearly
loved
wife
and
children
and
his
complaisant
courtiers
led
a
merry
life
the
grave
and
sombre
ritual
of
thebes
was
discarded
the
was
worshipped
with
songs
and
hymns
with
the
music
of
harps
and
flutes
with
offerings
of
cakes
and
fruits
and
flowers
blood
seldom
stained
his
kindly
altars
the
king
himself
celebrated
the
offices
of
religion
he
preached
with
unction
and
we
may
be
sure
that
his
courtiers
listened
with
at
least
an
outward
semblance
of
devotion
from
the
portraits
of
himself
which
he
has
bequeathed
to
us
we
can
still
picture
to
ourselves
the
heretic
king
in
the
pulpit
with
his
tall
lanky
figure
his
bandy
legs
his
his
long
lean
haggard
face
aglow
with
the
fever
of
religious
fanaticism
yet
the
doctrine
as
he
loved
to
call
it
which
he
proclaimed
to
his
hearers
was
apparently
no
stern
message
of
renunciation
in
this
world
of
terrors
in
the
world
to
come
the
thoughts
of
death
of
judgment
and
of
a
life
beyond
the
grave
which
weighed
like
a
nightmare
on
the
minds
of
the
egyptians
seem
to
have
been
banished
for
a
time
even
the
name
of
osiris
the
awful
judge
of
the
dead
is
not
once
mentioned
in
the
graves
at
all
this
lasted
only
during
the
life
of
the
reformer
his
death
was
followed
by
a
violent
reaction
the
old
gods
were
reinstated
in
their
rank
and
privileges
their
names
and
images
were
restored
and
new
temples
were
built
but
all
the
shrines
and
palaces
reared
by
the
late
king
were
thrown
down
even
the
sculptures
that
referred
to
him
and
to
his
god
in
and
on
the
sides
of
hills
were
erased
or
filled
up
with
stucco
his
name
appears
on
no
later
monument
and
was
carefully
omitted
from
all
official
lists
the
new
capital
was
abandoned
never
to
be
inhabited
again
its
plan
can
still
be
traced
in
the
sands
of
the
desert
this
attempt
of
king
amenophis
iv
is
only
an
extreme
example
of
a
tendency
which
appears
to
have
affected
the
religion
of
egypt
as
far
back
as
we
can
trace
it
therefore
to
come
back
to
our
point
in
attempting
to
discover
the
original
character
of
any
egyptian
god
no
weight
can
be
given
to
the
identification
of
him
with
other
gods
least
of
all
with
the
ra
far
from
helping
to
follow
up
the
trail
these
identifications
only
cross
and
confuse
it
the
best
evidence
for
the
original
character
of
the
egyptian
gods
is
to
be
found
in
their
ritual
and
myths
so
far
as
these
are
known
and
in
the
manner
in
which
they
are
portrayed
on
the
monuments
it
is
mainly
on
evidence
drawn
from
these
sources
that
i
rest
my
interpretation
of
osiris
the
ground
upon
which
some
modern
writers
seem
chiefly
to
rely
for
the
identification
of
osiris
with
the
sun
is
that
the
story
of
his
death
fits
better
with
the
solar
phenomena
than
with
any
other
in
nature
it
may
readily
be
admitted
that
the
daily
appearance
and
disappearance
of
the
sun
might
very
naturally
be
expressed
by
a
myth
of
his
death
and
resurrection
and
writers
who
regard
osiris
as
the
sun
are
careful
to
indicate
that
it
is
the
diurnal
and
not
the
annual
course
of
the
sun
to
which
they
understand
the
myth
to
apply
thus
renouf
who
identified
osiris
with
the
sun
admitted
that
the
egyptian
sun
could
not
with
any
show
of
reason
be
described
as
dead
in
winter
but
if
his
daily
death
was
the
theme
of
the
legend
why
was
it
celebrated
by
an
annual
ceremony
this
fact
alone
seems
fatal
to
the
interpretation
of
the
myth
as
descriptive
of
sunset
and
sunrise
again
though
the
sun
may
be
said
to
die
daily
in
what
sense
can
he
be
said
to
be
torn
in
pieces
in
the
course
of
our
inquiry
it
has
i
trust
been
made
clear
that
there
is
another
natural
phenomenon
to
which
the
conception
of
death
and
resurrection
is
as
applicable
as
to
sunset
and
sunrise
and
which
as
a
matter
of
fact
has
been
so
conceived
and
represented
in
that
phenomenon
is
the
annual
growth
and
decay
of
vegetation
a
strong
reason
for
interpreting
the
death
of
osiris
as
the
decay
of
vegetation
rather
than
as
the
sunset
is
to
be
found
in
the
general
though
not
unanimous
voice
of
antiquity
which
classed
together
the
worship
and
myths
of
osiris
adonis
attis
dionysus
and
demeter
as
religions
of
essentially
the
same
type
the
consensus
of
ancient
opinion
on
this
subject
seems
too
great
to
be
rejected
as
a
mere
fancy
so
closely
did
the
rites
of
osiris
resemble
those
of
adonis
at
byblus
that
some
of
the
people
of
byblus
themselves
maintained
that
it
was
osiris
and
not
adonis
whose
death
was
mourned
by
them
such
a
view
could
certainly
not
have
been
held
if
the
rituals
of
the
two
gods
had
not
been
so
alike
as
to
be
almost
indistinguishable
herodotus
found
the
similarity
between
the
rites
of
osiris
and
dionysus
so
great
that
he
thought
it
impossible
the
latter
could
have
arisen
independently
they
must
he
supposed
have
been
recently
borrowed
with
slight
alterations
by
the
greeks
from
the
egyptians
again
plutarch
a
very
keen
student
of
comparative
religion
insists
upon
the
detailed
resemblance
of
the
rites
of
osiris
to
those
of
dionysus
we
can
not
reject
the
evidence
of
such
intelligent
and
trustworthy
witnesses
on
plain
matters
of
fact
which
fell
under
their
own
cognizance
their
explanations
of
the
worships
it
is
indeed
possible
to
reject
for
the
meaning
of
religious
cults
is
often
open
to
question
but
resemblances
of
ritual
are
matters
of
observation
therefore
those
who
explain
osiris
as
the
sun
are
driven
to
the
alternative
of
either
dismissing
as
mistaken
the
testimony
of
antiquity
to
the
similarity
of
the
rites
of
osiris
adonis
attis
dionysus
and
demeter
or
of
interpreting
all
these
rites
as
no
modern
scholar
has
fairly
faced
and
accepted
either
side
of
this
alternative
to
accept
the
former
would
be
to
affirm
that
we
know
the
rites
of
these
deities
better
than
the
men
who
practised
or
at
least
who
witnessed
them
to
accept
the
latter
would
involve
a
wrenching
clipping
mangling
and
distorting
of
myth
and
ritual
from
which
even
macrobius
shrank
on
the
other
hand
the
view
that
the
essence
of
all
these
rites
was
the
mimic
death
and
revival
of
vegetation
explains
them
separately
and
collectively
in
an
easy
and
natural
way
and
harmonizes
with
the
general
testimony
borne
by
the
ancients
to
their
substantial
similarity
chapter
viii
osiris
and
the
moon
before
we
conclude
this
study
of
osiris
it
will
be
worth
while
to
consider
an
ancient
view
of
his
nature
which
deserves
more
attention
than
it
has
received
in
modern
times
we
are
told
by
plutarch
that
among
the
philosophers
who
saw
in
the
gods
of
egypt
personifications
of
natural
objects
and
forces
there
were
some
who
interpreted
osiris
as
the
moon
and
his
enemy
typhon
as
the
sun
because
the
moon
with
her
humid
and
generative
light
is
favourable
to
the
propagation
of
animals
and
the
growth
of
plants
while
the
sun
with
his
fierce
fire
scorches
and
burns
up
all
growing
things
renders
the
greater
part
of
the
earth
uninhabitable
by
reason
of
his

and
often
overpowers
the

whatever
may
be
thought
of
the
physical
qualities
here
attributed
to
the
moon
the
arguments
adduced
by
the
ancients
to
prove
the
identity
of
osiris
with
that
luminary
carry
with
them
a
weight
which
has
at
least
not
been
lightened
by
the
results
of
modern
research
an
examination
of
them
and
of
other
evidence
pointing
in
the
same
direction
will
perhaps
help
to
set
the
original
character
of
the
egyptian
deity
in
a
clearer
light
osiris
was
said
to
have
lived
or
reigned
years
this
might
fairly
be
taken
as
a
mythical
expression
for
a
lunar
month
his
body
was
reported
to
have
been
rent
into
fourteen
pieces
this
might
be
interpreted
of
the
waning
moon
which
appears
to
lose
a
portion
of
itself
on
each
of
the
fourteen
days
that
make
up
the
second
half
of
a
lunar
month
it
is
expressly
said
that
his
enemy
typhon
found
the
body
of
osiris
at
the
full
moon
thus
the
dismemberment
of
the
god
would
begin
with
the
waning
of
the
moon
to
primitive
man
it
seems
manifest
that
the
waning
moon
is
actually
dwindling
and
he
naturally
enough
explains
its
diminution
by
supposing
that
the
planet
is
being
rent
or
broken
in
pieces
or
eaten
away
the
klamath
indians
of
oregon
speak
of
the
moon
as
the
one
broken
to
pieces
with
reference
to
its
changing
aspect
they
never
apply
such
a
term
to
the
sun
whose
apparent
change
of
bulk
at
different
seasons
of
the
year
is
far
too
insignificant
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
savage
or
at
least
to
be
described
by
him
in
such
forcible
language
the
dacotas
believe
that
when
the
moon
is
full
a
great
many
little
mice
begin
to
nibble
at
one
side
of
it
and
do
not
cease
till
they
have
eaten
it
all
up
after
which
a
new
moon
is
born
and
grows
to
maturity
only
to
share
the
fate
of
its
countless
predecessors
a
similar
belief
is
held
by
the
huzuls
of
the
carpathians
except
that
they
ascribe
the
destruction
of
the
old
moon
to
wolves
instead
of
to
mice
at
the
new
moon
of
the
month
phamenoth
which
was
the
beginning
of
spring
the
egyptians
celebrated
what
they
called
the
entry
of
osiris
into
the
at
the
ceremony
called
the
burial
of
osiris
the
egyptians
made
a
chest
because
the
moon
when
it
approaches
the
sun
assumes
the
form
of
a
crescent
and
the
bull
apis
held
to
be
an
image
of
the
soul
of
osiris
was
born
of
a
cow
which
was
believed
to
have
been
impregnated
not
in
the
vulgar
way
by
a
bull
but
by
a
divine
influence
emanating
from
the
moon
once
a
year
at
the
full
moon
pigs
were
sacrificed
simultaneously
to
the
moon
and
osiris
in
a
hymn
supposed
to
be
addressed
by
isis
to
osiris
it
is
said
that
thy
soul
in
the
bark
that
name
which
is
thine
of
and
again
who
comest
to
us
as
a
child
each
month
do
not
cease
to
contemplate
emanation
heightens
the
the
stars
of
orion
in
the
here
then
osiris
is
identified
with
the
moon
in
set
terms
if
in
the
same
hymn
he
is
said
to
illuminate
us
like
ra
the
sun
that
is
obviously
no
reason
for
identifying
him
with
the
sun
but
quite
the
contrary
for
though
the
moon
may
reasonably
be
compared
to
the
sun
neither
the
sun
nor
anything
else
can
reasonably
be
compared
to
itself
in
art
osiris
is
sometimes
represented
as
a
mummy
grasping
in
his
hands
his
characteristic
emblems
and
wearing
on
his
head
instead
of
the
usual
crown
a
full
moon
within
a
crescent
now
if
in
one
of
his
aspects
osiris
was
originally
a
deity
of
vegetation
we
can
easily
enough
understand
why
in
a
later
and
more
philosophic
age
he
should
come
to
be
thus
identified
or
confounded
with
the
moon
for
as
soon
as
he
begins
to
meditate
upon
the
causes
of
things
the
early
philosopher
is
led
by
certain
obvious
though
fallacious
appearances
to
regard
the
moon
as
the
ultimate
cause
of
the
growth
of
plants
in
the
first
place
he
associates
its
apparent
growth
and
decay
with
the
growth
and
decay
of
sublunary
things
and
imagines
that
in
virtue
of
a
secret
sympathy
the
celestial
phenomena
really
produce
those
terrestrial
changes
which
in
point
of
fact
they
merely
resemble
thus
pliny
says
that
the
moon
may
fairly
be
considered
the
planet
of
breath
because
it
saturates
the
earth
and
by
its
approach
fills
bodies
while
by
its
departure
it
empties
them
hence
it
is
he
goes
on
that
increase
with
the
increase
of
the
moon
and
that
bloodless
creatures
especially
feel
breath
at
that
time
even
the
blood
of
men
grows
and
diminishes
with
the
light
of
the
moon
and
leaves
and
herbage
also
feel
the
same
influence
since
the
lunar
energy
penetrates
all
there
is
no
doubt
writes
macrobius
that
the
moon
is
the
author
and
framer
of
mortal
bodies
so
much
so
that
some
things
expand
or
shrink
as
it
waxes
or
again
aulus
gellius
puts
in
the
mouth
of
a
friend
the
remark
that
the
same
things
which
grow
with
the
waxing
do
dwindle
with
the
waning
moon
and
he
quotes
from
a
commentary
of
plutarch
s
on
hesiod
a
statement
that
the
onion
is
the
only
vegetable
which
violates
this
great
law
of
nature
by
sprouting
in
the
wane
and
withering
in
the
increase
of
the
moon
scottish
highlanders
allege
that
in
the
increase
of
the
moon
everything
has
a
tendency
to
grow
or
stick
together
and
they
call
the
second
moon
of
autumn
the
ripening
moon
an
because
they
imagine
that
crops
ripen
as
much
by
its
light
as
by
day
from
this
supposed
influence
of
the
moon
on
the
life
of
plants
and
animals
men
in
ancient
and
modern
times
have
deduced
a
whole
code
of
rules
for
the
guidance
of
the
husbandman
the
shepherd
and
others
in
the
conduct
of
their
affairs
thus
an
ancient
writer
on
agriculture
lays
it
down
as
a
maxim
that
whatever
is
to
be
sown
should
be
sown
while
the
moon
is
waxing
and
that
whatever
is
to
be
cut
or
gathered
should
be
cut
or
gathered
while
it
is
waning
a
modern
treatise
on
superstition
describes
how
the
superstitious
man
regulates
all
his
conduct
by
the
moon
whatever
he
would
have
to
grow
he
sets
about
it
when
she
is
in
her
increase
but
for
what
he
would
have
made
less
he
chooses
her
in
germany
the
phases
of
the
moon
are
observed
by
superstitious
people
at
all
the
more
or
even
less
important
actions
of
life
such
as
tilling
the
fields
building
or
changing
houses
marriages
bleeding
cupping
and
so
forth
the
particular
rules
vary
in
different
places
but
the
principle
generally
followed
is
that
whatever
is
done
to
increase
anything
should
be
done
while
the
moon
is
waxing
whatever
is
done
to
diminish
anything
should
be
done
while
the
moon
is
waning
for
example
sowing
planting
and
grafting
should
be
done
in
the
first
half
of
the
moon
but
the
felling
of
timber
and
mowing
should
be
done
in
the
second
half
in
various
parts
of
europe
it
is
believed
that
plants
nails
hair
and
corns
cut
while
the
moon
is
on
the
increase
will
grow
again
fast
but
that
if
cut
while
it
is
on
the
decrease
they
will
grow
slowly
or
waste
away
hence
persons
who
wish
their
hair
to
grow
thick
and
long
should
cut
it
in
the
first
half
of
the
moon
on
the
same
principle
sheep
are
shorn
when
the
moon
is
waxing
because
it
is
supposed
that
the
wool
will
then
be
longest
and
most
enduring
some
negroes
of
the
gaboon
think
that
taro
and
other
vegetables
never
thrive
if
they
are
planted
after
full
moon
but
that
they
grow
fast
and
strong
if
they
are
planted
in
the
first
quarter
the
highlanders
of
scotland
used
to
expect
better
crops
of
grain
by
sowing
their
seed
in
the
moon
s
increase
on
the
other
hand
they
thought
that
garden
vegetables
such
as
onions
and
kail
run
to
seed
if
they
are
sown
in
the
increase
but
that
they
grow
to
if
they
are
sown
in
the
wane
so
thomas
tusser
advised
the
peasant
to
sow
peas
and
beans
in
the
wane
of
the
moon
that
they
with
the
planet
may
rest
and
the
zulus
welcome
the
first
appearance
of
the
new
moon
with
beating
of
drums
and
other
demonstrations
of
joy
but
next
day
they
abstain
from
all
labour
thinking
that
if
anything
is
sown
on
those
days
they
can
never
reap
the
benefit
but
in
this
matter
of
sowing
and
planting
a
refined
distinction
is
sometimes
drawn
by
french
german
and
esthonian
peasants
plants
which
bear
fruit
above
ground
are
sown
by
them
when
the
moon
is
waxing
but
plants
which
are
cultivated
for
the
sake
of
their
roots
such
as
potatoes
and
turnips
are
sown
when
the
moon
is
waning
the
reason
for
this
distinction
seems
to
be
a
vague
idea
that
the
waxing
moon
is
coming
up
and
the
waning
moon
going
down
and
that
accordingly
fruits
which
grow
upwards
should
be
sown
in
the
former
period
and
fruits
which
grow
downwards
in
the
latter
before
beginning
to
plant
their
cacao
the
pipiles
of
central
america
exposed
the
finest
seeds
for
four
nights
to
the
moonlight
but
whether
they
did
so
at
the
waxing
or
waning
of
the
moon
is
not
said
even
pots
it
would
seem
are
not
exempt
from
this
great
law
of
nature
in
uganda
potters
waited
for
the
new
moon
to
appear
before
baking
their
pots
when
it
was
some
days
old
they
prepared
their
fires
and
baked
the
vessels
no
potter
would
bake
pots
when
the
moon
was
past
the
full
for
he
believed
that
they
would
be
a
failure
and
would
be
sure
to
crack
or
break
in
the
burning
if
he
did
so
and
that
his
labour
accordingly
would
go
for
again
the
waning
of
the
moon
has
been
commonly
recommended
both
in
ancient
and
modern
times
as
the
proper
time
for
felling
trees
apparently
because
it
was
thought
fit
and
natural
that
the
operation
of
cutting
down
should
be
performed
on
earth
at
the
time
when
the
lunar
orb
was
so
to
say
being
cut
down
in
the
sky
in
france
before
the
revolution
the
forestry
laws
enjoined
that
trees
should
only
be
felled
after
the
moon
had
passed
the
full
and
in
french
bills
announcing
the
sale
of
timber
you
may
still
read
a
notice
that
the
wood
was
cut
in
the
waning
of
the
moon
so
among
the
shans
of
burma
when
a
house
is
to
be
built
it
is
a
rule
that
a
lucky
day
should
be
chosen
to
commence
the
cutting
of
the
bamboos
the
day
must
not
only
be
a
fortunate
one
for
the
builder
but
it
must
also
be
in
the
second
half
of
the
month
when
the
moon
is
waning
shans
believe
that
if
bamboos
are
cut
during
the
first
half
of
the
month
when
the
moon
is
waxing
they
do
not
last
well
as
boring
insects
attack
them
and
they
will
soon
become
rotten
this
belief
is
prevalent
all
over
the
a
like
belief
obtains
in
various
parts
of
mexico
no
mexican
will
cut
timber
while
the
moon
is
increasing
they
say
it
must
be
cut
while
the
moon
is
waning
or
the
wood
will
certainly
rot
in
colombia
south
america
people
think
that
corn
should
only
be
sown
and
timber
felled
when
the
moon
is
on
the
wane
they
say
that
the
waxing
moon
draws
the
sap
up
through
the
trunk
and
branches
whereas
the
sap
flows
down
and
leaves
the
wood
dry
during
the
wane
of
the
moon
but
sometimes
the
opposite
rule
is
adopted
and
equally
forcible
arguments
are
urged
in
its
defence
thus
when
the
wabondei
of
eastern
africa
are
about
to
build
a
house
they
take
care
to
cut
the
posts
for
it
when
the
moon
is
on
the
increase
for
they
say
that
posts
cut
when
the
moon
is
wasting
away
would
soon
rot
whereas
posts
cut
while
the
moon
is
waxing
are
very
durable
the
same
rule
is
observed
for
the
same
reason
in
some
parts
of
germany
but
the
partisans
of
the
ordinarily
received
opinion
have
sometimes
supported
it
by
another
reason
which
introduces
us
to
the
second
of
those
fallacious
appearances
by
which
men
have
been
led
to
regard
the
moon
as
the
cause
of
growth
in
plants
from
observing
rightly
that
dew
falls
most
thickly
on
cloudless
nights
they
inferred
wrongly
that
it
was
caused
by
the
moon
a
theory
which
the
poet
alcman
expressed
in
mythical
form
by
saying
that
dew
was
a
daughter
of
zeus
and
the
moon
hence
the
ancients
concluded
that
the
moon
is
the
great
source
of
moisture
as
the
sun
is
the
great
source
of
heat
and
as
the
humid
power
of
the
moon
was
assumed
to
be
greater
when
the
planet
was
waxing
than
when
it
was
waning
they
thought
that
timber
cut
during
the
increase
of
the
luminary
would
be
saturated
with
moisture
whereas
timber
cut
in
the
wane
would
be
comparatively
dry
hence
we
are
told
that
in
antiquity
carpenters
would
reject
timber
felled
when
the
moon
was
growing
or
full
because
they
believed
that
such
timber
teemed
with
sap
and
in
the
vosges
at
the
present
day
people
allege
that
wood
cut
at
the
new
moon
does
not
dry
we
have
seen
that
the
same
reason
is
assigned
for
the
same
practice
in
colombia
in
the
hebrides
peasants
give
the
same
reason
for
cutting
their
peats
when
the
moon
is
on
the
wane
for
they
observe
that
if
they
are
cut
in
the
increase
they
continue
still
moist
and
never
burn
clear
nor
are
they
without
smoke
but
the
contrary
is
daily
observed
of
peats
cut
in
the
thus
misled
by
a
double
fallacy
primitive
philosophy
comes
to
view
the
moon
as
the
great
cause
of
vegetable
growth
first
because
the
planet
seems
itself
to
grow
and
second
because
it
is
supposed
to
be
the
source
of
dew
and
moisture
it
is
no
wonder
therefore
that
agricultural
peoples
should
adore
the
planet
which
they
believe
to
influence
so
profoundly
the
crops
on
which
they
depend
for
subsistence
accordingly
we
find
that
in
the
hotter
regions
of
america
where
maize
is
cultivated
and
manioc
is
the
staple
food
the
moon
was
recognized
as
the
principal
object
of
worship
and
plantations
of
manioc
were
assigned
to
it
as
a
return
for
the
service
it
rendered
in
the
production
of
the
crops
the
worship
of
the
moon
in
preference
to
the
sun
was
general
among
the
caribs
and
perhaps
also
among
most
of
the
other
indian
tribes
who
cultivated
maize
in
the
tropical
forests
to
the
east
of
the
andes
and
the
same
thing
has
been
observed
under
the
same
physical
conditions
among
the
aborigines
of
the
hottest
region
of
peru
the
northern
valleys
of
yuncapata
here
the
indians
of
pacasmayu
and
the
neighbouring
valleys
revered
the
moon
as
their
principal
divinity
the
house
of
the
moon
at
pacasmayu
was
the
chief
temple
of
the
district
and
the
same
sacrifices
of
of
wine
and
of
children
which
were
offered
by
the
mountaineers
of
the
andes
to
the
were
offered
by
the
lowlanders
to
the
in
order
that
he
might
cause
their
crops
to
thrive
in
ancient
babylonia
where
the
population
was
essentially
agricultural
the
took
precedence
of
the
and
was
indeed
reckoned
his
father
hence
it
would
be
no
matter
for
surprise
if
after
worshipping
the
crops
which
furnished
them
with
the
means
of
subsistence
the
ancient
egyptians
should
in
later
times
have
identified
the
spirit
of
the
corn
with
the
moon
which
a
false
philosophy
had
taught
them
to
regard
as
the
ultimate
cause
of
the
growth
of
vegetation
in
this
way
we
can
understand
why
in
their
most
recent
forms
the
myth
and
ritual
of
osiris
the
old
god
of
trees
and
corn
should
bear
many
traces
of
efforts
made
to
bring
them
into
a
superficial
conformity
with
the
new
doctrine
of
his
lunar
affinity
chapter
ix
the
doctrine
of
lunar
sympathy
in
the
preceding
chapter
some
evidence
was
adduced
of
the
sympathetic
influence
which
the
waxing
or
waning
moon
is
popularly
supposed
to
exert
on
growth
especially
on
the
growth
of
vegetation
but
the
doctrine
of
lunar
sympathy
does
not
stop
there
it
is
applied
also
to
the
affairs
of
man
and
various
customs
and
rules
have
been
deduced
from
it
which
aim
at
the
amelioration
and
even
the
indefinite
extension
of
human
life
to
illustrate
this
application
of
the
popular
theory
at
length
would
be
out
of
place
here
but
a
few
cases
may
be
mentioned
by
way
of
specimen
the
natural
fact
on
which
all
the
customs
in
question
seem
to
rest
is
the
apparent
monthly
increase
and
decrease
of
the
moon
from
this
observation
men
have
inferred
that
all
things
simultaneously
wax
or
wane
in
sympathy
with
it
thus
the
mentras
or
mantras
of
the
malay
peninsula
have
a
tradition
that
in
the
beginning
men
did
not
die
but
grew
thin
with
the
waning
of
the
moon
and
waxed
fat
as
she
neared
the
full
of
the
scottish
highlanders
we
are
told
that
the
moon
in
her
increase
full
growth
and
in
her
wane
are
with
them
the
emblems
of
a
rising
flourishing
and
declining
fortune
at
the
last
period
of
her
revolution
they
carefully
avoid
to
engage
in
any
business
of
importance
but
the
first
and
middle
they
seize
with
avidity
presaging
the
most
auspicious
issue
to
their
similarly
in
some
parts
of
germany
it
is
commonly
believed
that
whatever
is
undertaken
when
the
moon
is
on
the
increase
succeeds
well
and
that
the
full
moon
brings
everything
to
perfection
whereas
business
undertaken
in
the
wane
of
the
moon
is
doomed
to
failure
this
german
belief
has
come
down
as
we
might
have
anticipated
from
barbaric
times
for
tacitus
tells
us
that
the
germans
considered
the
new
or
the
full
moon
the
most
auspicious
time
for
business
and
caesar
informs
us
that
the
germans
despaired
of
victory
if
they
joined
battle
before
the
new
moon
the
spartans
seem
to
have
been
of
the
same
opinion
for
it
was
a
rule
with
them
never
to
march
out
to
war
except
when
the
moon
was
full
the
rule
prevented
them
from
sending
troops
in
time
to
fight
the
persians
at
marathon
and
but
for
athenian
valour
this
paltry
superstition
might
have
turned
the
scale
of
battle
and
decided
the
destiny
of
greece
if
not
of
europe
for
centuries
the
athenians
themselves
paid
dear
for
a
similar
scruple
an
eclipse
of
the
moon
cost
them
the
loss
of
a
gallant
fleet
and
army
before
syracuse
and
practically
sealed
the
fate
of
athens
for
she
never
recovered
from
the
blow
so
heavy
is
the
sacrifice
which
superstition
demands
of
its
votaries
in
this
respect
the
greeks
were
on
a
level
with
the
negroes
of
the
sudan
among
whom
if
a
march
has
been
decided
upon
during
the
last
quarter
of
the
moon
the
departure
is
always
deferred
until
the
first
day
of
the
new
moon
no
chief
would
dare
to
undertake
an
expedition
and
lead
out
his
warriors
before
the
appearance
of
the
crescent
merchants
and
private
persons
observe
the
same
rule
on
their
journeys
in
like
manner
the
mandingoes
of
senegambia
pay
great
attention
to
the
changes
of
the
moon
and
think
it
very
unlucky
to
begin
a
journey
or
any
other
work
of
consequence
in
the
last
quarter
it
is
especially
the
appearance
of
the
new
moon
with
its
promise
of
growth
and
increase
which
is
greeted
with
ceremonies
intended
to
renew
and
invigorate
by
means
of
sympathetic
magic
the
life
of
man
observers
ignorant
of
savage
superstition
have
commonly
misinterpreted
such
customs
as
worship
or
adoration
paid
to
the
moon
in
point
of
fact
the
ceremonies
of
new
moon
are
probably
in
many
cases
rather
magical
than
religious
the
indians
of
the
ucayali
river
in
peru
hail
the
appearance
of
the
new
moon
with
great
joy
they
make
long
speeches
to
her
accompanied
with
vehement
gesticulations
imploring
her
protection
and
begging
that
she
will
be
so
good
as
to
invigorate
their
bodies
on
the
day
when
the
new
moon
first
appeared
it
was
a
custom
with
the
indians
of
san
juan
capistrano
in
california
to
call
together
all
the
young
men
for
the
purpose
of
its
celebration
la
luna
shouted
one
of
the
old
men
come
my
boys
the
moon
the
moon
immediately
the
young
men
began
to
run
about
in
a
disorderly
fashion
as
if
they
were
distracted
while
the
old
men
danced
in
a
circle
saying
as
the
moon
dieth
and
cometh
to
life
again
so
we
also
having
to
die
will
again
an
old
traveller
tells
us
that
at
the
appearance
of
every
new
moon
the
negroes
of
the
congo
clapped
their
hands
and
cried
out
sometimes
falling
on
their
knees
so
may
i
renew
my
life
as
thou
art
but
if
the
sky
happened
to
be
clouded
they
did
nothing
alleging
that
the
planet
had
lost
its
virtue
a
somewhat
similar
custom
prevails
among
the
ovambo
of
africa
on
the
first
moonlight
night
of
the
new
moon
young
and
old
their
bodies
smeared
with
white
earth
perhaps
in
imitation
of
the
planet
s
silvery
light
dance
to
the
moon
and
address
to
it
wishes
which
they
feel
sure
will
be
granted
we
may
conjecture
that
among
these
wishes
is
a
prayer
for
a
renewal
of
life
when
a
masai
sees
the
new
moon
he
throws
a
twig
or
stone
at
it
with
his
left
hand
and
says
give
me
long
life
or
give
me
strength
and
when
a
pregnant
woman
sees
the
new
moon
she
milks
some
milk
into
a
small
gourd
which
she
covers
with
green
grass
then
she
pours
the
milk
away
in
the
direction
of
the
moon
and
says
moon
give
me
my
child
among
the
wagogo
of
german
east
africa
at
sight
of
the
new
moon
some
people
break
a
stick
in
pieces
spit
on
the
pieces
and
throw
them
towards
the
moon
saying
let
all
illness
go
to
the
west
where
the
sun
among
the
boloki
of
the
upper
congo
there
is
much
shouting
and
gesticulation
on
the
appearance
of
a
new
moon
those
who
have
enjoyed
good
health
pray
that
it
may
be
continued
and
those
who
have
been
sick
ascribe
their
illness
to
the
coming
of
the
luminary
and
beg
her
to
take
away
bad
health
and
give
them
good
health
instead
the
esthonians
think
that
all
the
misfortunes
which
might
befall
a
man
in
the
course
of
a
month
may
be
forestalled
and
shifted
to
the
moon
if
a
man
will
only
say
to
the
new
moon
good
morrow
new
moon
i
must
grow
young
you
must
grow
old
my
eyes
must
grow
bright
yours
must
grow
dark
i
must
grow
light
as
a
bird
you
must
grow
heavy
as
on
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
moon
that
is
at
the
time
when
the
luminary
has
begun
to
wane
the
coreans
take
round
pieces
of
paper
either
red
or
white
which
represent
the
moon
and
having
fixed
them
perpendicularly
on
split
sticks
they
place
them
on
the
tops
of
the
houses
then
persons
who
have
been
forewarned
by
of
impending
evil
pray
to
the
moon
to
remove
it
from
them
in
india
people
attempt
to
absorb
the
vital
influence
of
the
moon
by
drinking
water
in
which
the
luminary
is
reflected
thus
the
mohammedans
of
oude
fill
a
silver
basin
with
water
and
hold
it
so
that
the
orb
of
the
full
moon
is
mirrored
in
it
the
person
to
be
benefited
must
look
steadfastly
at
the
moon
in
the
basin
then
shut
his
eyes
and
drink
the
water
at
one
gulp
doctors
recommend
the
draught
as
a
remedy
for
nervous
disorders
and
palpitation
of
the
heart
somewhat
similar
customs
prevail
among
the
hindoos
of
northern
india
at
the
full
moon
of
the
month
of
kuar
people
lay
out
food
on
the
and
when
it
has
absorbed
the
rays
of
the
moon
they
distribute
it
among
their
relations
who
are
supposed
to
lengthen
their
life
by
eating
of
the
food
which
has
thus
been
saturated
with
moonshine
patients
are
often
made
to
look
at
the
moon
reflected
in
melted
butter
oil
or
milk
as
a
cure
for
leprosy
and
the
like
diseases
naturally
enough
the
genial
influence
of
moonshine
is
often
supposed
to
be
particularly
beneficial
to
children
for
will
not
the
waxing
moon
help
them
to
wax
in
strength
and
stature
hence
in
the
island
of
kiriwina
one
of
the
trobriands
group
to
the
east
of
new
guinea
a
mother
always
lifts
up
or
presents
her
child
to
the
first
full
moon
after
its
birth
in
order
that
it
may
grow
fast
and
talk
soon
so
among
the
baganda
of
central
africa
it
was
customary
for
each
mother
to
take
her
child
out
at
the
first
new
moon
after
its
birth
and
to
point
out
the
moon
to
the
infant
this
was
thought
to
make
the
child
grow
healthy
and
strong
among
the
thonga
of
south
africa
the
presentation
of
the
baby
to
the
moon
does
not
take
place
until
the
mother
has
resumed
her
monthly
periods
which
usually
happens
in
the
third
month
after
the
birth
when
the
new
moon
appears
the
mother
takes
a
torch
or
a
burning
brand
from
the
fire
and
goes
to
the
behind
the
hut
she
is
followed
by
the
grandmother
carrying
the
child
at
the
the
mother
throws
the
burning
stick
towards
the
moon
while
the
grandmother
tosses
the
baby
into
the
air
saying
this
is
your
moon
the
child
squalls
and
rolls
over
on
the
then
the
mother
snatches
up
the
infant
and
nurses
it
so
they
go
home
the
guarayos
indians
who
inhabit
the
gloomy
tropical
forests
of
eastern
bolivia
lift
up
their
children
in
the
air
at
new
moon
in
order
that
they
may
grow
among
the
apinagos
indians
on
the
tocantins
river
in
brazil
the
french
traveller
castelnau
witnessed
a
remarkable
dance
by
moonlight
the
indians
danced
in
two
long
ranks
which
faced
each
other
the
women
on
one
side
the
men
on
the
other
between
the
two
ranks
of
dancers
blazed
a
great
fire
the
men
were
painted
in
brilliant
colours
and
for
the
most
part
wore
white
or
red
made
of
and
resin
their
dancing
was
very
monotonous
and
consisted
of
a
jerky
movement
of
the
body
while
the
dancer
advanced
first
one
leg
and
then
the
other
this
dance
they
accompanied
with
a
melancholy
song
striking
the
ground
with
their
weapons
opposite
them
the
women
naked
and
unpainted
stood
in
a
single
rank
their
bodies
bent
slightly
forward
their
knees
pressed
together
their
arms
swinging
in
measured
time
now
forward
now
backward
so
as
to
join
hands
a
remarkable
figure
in
the
dance
was
a
personage
painted
scarlet
all
over
who
held
in
his
hand
a
rattle
composed
of
a
gourd
full
of
pebbles
from
time
to
time
he
leaped
across
the
great
fire
which
burned
between
the
men
and
the
women
then
he
would
run
rapidly
in
front
of
the
women
stopping
now
and
then
before
one
or
other
and
performing
a
series
of
strange
gambols
while
he
shook
his
rattle
violently
sometimes
he
would
sink
with
one
knee
to
the
ground
and
then
suddenly
throw
himself
backward
altogether
the
agility
and
endurance
which
he
displayed
were
remarkable
this
dance
lasted
for
hours
when
a
woman
was
tired
out
she
withdrew
and
her
place
was
taken
by
another
but
the
same
men
danced
the
monotonous
dance
all
night
towards
midnight
the
moon
attained
the
zenith
and
flooded
the
scene
with
her
bright
rays
a
change
now
took
place
in
the
dance
a
long
line
of
men
and
women
advanced
to
the
fire
between
the
ranks
of
the
dancers
each
of
them
held
one
end
of
a
hammock
in
which
lay
a
infant
whose
squalls
could
be
heard
these
babes
were
now
to
be
presented
by
their
parents
to
the
moon
on
reaching
the
end
of
the
line
each
couple
swung
the
hammock
accompanying
the
movement
by
a
chant
which
all
the
indians
sang
in
chorus
the
song
seemed
to
consist
of
three
words
repeated
over
and
over
again
soon
a
shrill
voice
was
heard
and
a
hideous
old
hag
like
a
skeleton
appeared
with
her
arms
raised
above
her
head
she
went
round
and
round
the
assembly
several
times
then
disappeared
in
silence
while
she
was
present
the
scarlet
dancer
with
the
rattle
bounded
about
more
furiously
than
ever
stopping
only
for
a
moment
while
he
passed
in
front
of
the
line
of
women
his
body
was
contracted
and
bent
towards
them
and
described
an
undulatory
movement
like
that
of
a
worm
writhing
he
shook
his
rattle
violently
as
if
he
would
fain
kindle
in
the
women
the
fire
which
burned
in
himself
then
rising
abruptly
he
would
resume
his
wild
career
during
this
time
the
loud
voice
of
an
orator
was
heard
from
the
village
repeating
a
curious
name
without
cessation
then
the
speaker
approached
slowly
carrying
on
his
back
some
gorgeous
bunches
of
brilliant
feathers
and
under
his
arm
a
stone
axe
behind
him
walked
a
young
woman
bearing
an
infant
in
a
loose
girdle
at
her
waist
the
child
was
wrapped
in
a
mat
which
protected
it
against
the
chill
night
air
the
couple
paced
slowly
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
vanished
without
speaking
a
word
at
the
same
moment
the
curious
name
which
the
orator
had
shouted
was
taken
up
by
the
whole
assembly
and
repeated
by
them
again
and
again
this
scene
in
its
turn
lasted
a
long
time
but
ceased
suddenly
with
the
setting
of
the
moon
the
french
traveller
who
witnessed
it
fell
asleep
and
when
he
awoke
all
was
calm
once
more
there
was
nothing
to
recall
the
infernal
dances
of
the
night
in
explanation
of
these
dances
castelnau
merely
observes
that
the
apinagos
like
many
other
south
american
indians
pay
a
superstitious
respect
to
the
moon
we
may
suppose
that
the
ceremonious
presentation
of
the
infants
to
the
moon
was
intended
to
ensure
their
life
and
growth
the
names
solemnly
chanted
by
the
whole
assembly
were
probably
those
which
the
parents
publicly
bestowed
on
their
children
as
to
the
scarlet
dancer
who
leaped
across
the
fire
we
may
conjecture
that
he
personated
the
moon
and
that
his
strange
antics
in
front
of
the
women
were
designed
to
impart
to
them
the
fertilizing
virtue
of
the
luminary
and
perhaps
to
facilitate
their
delivery
among
the
baganda
of
central
africa
there
is
general
rejoicing
when
the
new
moon
appears
and
no
work
is
done
for
seven
days
when
the
crescent
is
first
visible
at
evening
mothers
take
out
their
babies
and
hold
them
at
arms
length
saying
i
want
my
child
to
keep
in
health
till
the
moon
at
the
same
time
a
ceremony
is
performed
which
may
be
intended
to
ensure
the
king
s
life
and
health
throughout
the
ensuing
month
it
is
a
custom
with
the
baganda
to
preserve
the
king
s
with
great
care
during
his
life
the
precious
object
is
called
the
twin
of
the
king
as
if
it
were
his
double
and
the
ghost
of
the
royal
afterbirth
is
believed
to
be
attached
to
it
enclosed
in
a
pot
which
is
wrapt
in
bark
cloths
the
is
kept
in
a
temple
specially
built
for
it
near
the
king
s
enclosure
and
a
great
minister
of
state
acts
as
its
guardian
and
priest
every
new
moon
at
evening
he
carries
it
in
state
wrapped
in
bark
cloths
to
the
king
who
takes
it
into
his
hands
examines
it
and
returns
it
to
the
minister
the
keeper
of
the
then
goes
back
with
it
to
the
house
and
sets
it
in
the
doorway
where
it
remains
all
night
next
morning
it
is
taken
from
its
wrappings
and
again
placed
in
the
doorway
until
the
evening
when
it
is
once
more
swathed
in
bark
cloths
and
restored
to
its
usual
place
apparently
the
is
conceived
as
a
vital
portion
a
sort
of
external
soul
of
the
king
and
the
attentions
bestowed
on
it
at
the
new
moon
may
be
supposed
to
refresh
and
invigorate
it
thereby
refreshing
and
invigorating
the
king
s
life
the
armenians
appear
to
think
that
the
moon
exercises
a
baleful
influence
on
little
children
to
avert
that
influence
a
mother
will
show
the
moon
to
her
child
and
say
thine
uncle
thine
for
the
same
purpose
the
father
and
mother
will
mount
to
the
roof
of
the
house
at
new
moon
on
a
wednesday
or
friday
the
father
then
puts
the
child
on
a
shovel
and
gives
it
to
the
mother
saying
if
it
is
thine
take
it
to
thee
but
if
it
is
mine
rear
it
and
give
it
to
me
the
mother
then
takes
the
child
and
the
shovel
and
returns
them
to
the
father
in
like
manner
a
similar
opinion
as
to
the
noxious
influence
of
moonshine
on
children
was
apparently
held
by
the
ancient
greeks
for
greek
nurses
took
great
care
never
to
show
their
infants
to
the
moon
some
brazilian
indians
in
like
manner
guard
babies
against
the
moon
believing
that
it
would
make
them
ill
immediately
after
delivery
mothers
will
hide
themselves
and
their
infants
in
the
thickest
parts
of
the
forest
in
order
that
the
moonlight
may
not
fall
on
them
it
would
be
easy
to
understand
why
the
waning
moon
should
be
deemed
injurious
to
children
they
might
be
supposed
to
peak
and
pine
with
its
dwindling
light
thus
in
angus
it
is
thought
that
if
a
child
be
weaned
during
the
waning
of
the
moon
it
will
decay
all
the
time
that
the
moon
continues
to
wane
but
it
is
less
easy
to
see
why
the
same
deleterious
influence
on
children
should
be
ascribed
to
moonlight
in
general
there
are
many
other
ways
in
which
people
have
sought
to
turn
lunar
sympathy
to
practical
account
clearly
the
increase
of
the
moon
is
the
time
to
increase
your
goods
and
the
decrease
of
the
moon
is
the
time
to
diminish
your
ills
acting
on
this
imaginary
law
of
nature
many
persons
in
europe
show
their
money
to
the
new
moon
or
turn
it
in
their
pockets
at
that
season
in
the
belief
that
the
money
will
grow
with
the
growth
of
the
planet
sometimes
by
way
of
additional
precaution
they
spit
on
the
coin
at
the
same
time
both
christians
and
moslems
in
syria
turn
their
silver
money
in
their
pockets
at
the
new
moon
for
luck
and
two
persons
meeting
under
the
new
moon
will
each
take
out
a
silver
coin
and
embrace
saying
may
you
begin
and
end
and
may
it
be
a
good
month
to
conversely
the
waning
of
the
moon
is
the
most
natural
time
to
get
rid
of
bodily
ailments
in
brittany
they
think
that
warts
vary
with
the
phases
of
the
moon
growing
as
it
waxes
and
vanishing
away
as
it
wanes
accordingly
they
say
in
germany
that
if
you
would
rid
yourself
of
warts
you
should
treat
them
when
the
moon
is
on
the
decrease
and
a
german
cure
for
toothache
earache
headache
and
so
forth
is
to
look
towards
the
waning
moon
and
say
as
the
moon
decreases
so
may
my
pains
decrease
however
some
germans
reverse
the
rule
they
say
for
example
that
if
you
are
afflicted
with
a
wen
you
should
face
the
waxing
moon
lay
your
finger
on
the
wen
and
say
thrice
what
i
see
waxes
what
i
touch
let
it
vanish
after
each
of
these
two
sentences
you
should
cross
yourself
thrice
then
go
home
without
speaking
to
any
one
and
repeat
three
paternosters
behind
the
kitchen
door
the
huzuls
of
the
carpathians
recommend
a
somewhat
similar
and
no
doubt
equally
efficacious
cure
for
waterbrash
they
say
that
at
new
moon
the
patient
should
run
thrice
round
the
house
and
then
say
to
the
moon
moon
moon
where
wast
thou
behind
the
what
hast
thou
eaten
there
horse
why
hast
thou
brought
me
nothing
because
i
may
the
waterbrash
forget
to
burn
me
thus
a
curative
virtue
appears
to
be
attributed
by
some
people
to
the
waning
and
by
others
to
the
waxing
moon
there
is
perhaps
just
as
much
or
as
little
to
be
said
for
the
one
attribution
as
for
the
other
chapter
x
the
king
as
osiris
in
the
foregoing
discussion
we
found
reason
to
believe
that
the
semitic
adonis
and
the
phrygian
attis
were
at
one
time
personated
in
the
flesh
by
kings
princes
or
priests
who
played
the
part
of
the
god
for
a
time
and
then
either
died
a
violent
death
in
the
divine
character
or
had
to
redeem
their
life
in
one
way
or
another
whether
by
performing
a
sacrifice
at
some
expense
of
pain
and
danger
to
themselves
or
by
delegating
the
duty
to
a
substitute
further
we
conjectured
that
in
egypt
the
part
of
osiris
may
have
been
played
by
the
king
himself
it
remains
to
adduce
some
positive
evidence
of
this
personation
a
great
festival
called
the
sed
was
celebrated
by
the
egyptians
with
much
solemnity
at
intervals
of
thirty
years
various
portions
of
the
ritual
are
represented
on
the
ancient
monuments
of
hieraconpolis
and
abydos
and
in
the
oldest
decorated
temple
of
egypt
known
to
us
that
of
usirniri
at
busiris
which
dates
from
the
fifth
dynasty
it
appears
that
the
ceremonies
were
as
old
as
the
egyptian
civilization
and
that
they
continued
to
be
observed
till
the
end
of
the
roman
period
the
reason
for
holding
them
at
intervals
of
thirty
years
is
uncertain
but
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
the
period
was
determined
by
astronomical
considerations
according
to
one
view
it
was
based
on
the
observation
of
saturn
s
period
of
revolution
round
the
sun
which
is
roughly
speaking
thirty
years
or
more
exactly
years
and
one
hundred
and
days
according
to
another
view
the
thirty
years
period
had
reference
to
sirius
the
star
of
isis
we
have
seen
that
on
account
of
the
vague
character
of
the
old
egyptian
year
the
heliacal
rising
of
sirius
shifted
its
place
gradually
through
every
month
of
the
calendar
in
one
hundred
and
twenty
years
the
star
thus
passed
through
one
whole
month
of
thirty
days
to
speak
more
precisely
it
rose
on
the
first
of
the
month
during
the
first
four
years
of
the
period
it
rose
on
the
second
of
the
month
in
the
second
four
years
on
the
third
of
the
month
in
the
third
four
years
and
so
on
successively
till
in
the
last
four
years
of
the
hundred
and
twenty
years
it
rose
on
the
last
day
of
the
month
as
the
egyptians
watched
the
annual
summer
rising
of
the
star
with
attention
and
associated
it
with
the
most
popular
of
their
goddesses
it
would
be
natural
that
its
passage
from
one
month
to
another
at
intervals
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
years
should
be
the
occasion
of
a
great
festival
and
that
the
long
period
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
years
should
be
divided
into
four
minor
periods
of
thirty
years
respectively
each
celebrated
by
a
minor
festival
if
this
theory
of
the
sed
festivals
is
correct
we
should
expect
to
find
that
every
fourth
celebration
was
distinguished
from
the
rest
by
a
higher
degree
of
solemnity
since
it
marked
the
completion
of
a
twelfth
part
of
the
star
s
journey
through
the
twelve
months
now
it
appears
that
in
point
of
fact
every
fourth
sed
festival
was
marked
off
from
its
fellows
by
the
adjective
or
chief
and
that
these
chief
celebrations
fell
as
a
rule
in
the
years
when
sirius
rose
on
the
first
of
the
month
these
facts
confirm
the
view
that
the
sed
festival
was
closely
connected
with
the
star
sirius
and
through
it
with
isis
however
we
are
here
concerned
rather
with
the
meaning
and
the
rites
of
the
festival
than
with
the
reasons
for
holding
it
once
every
thirty
years
the
intention
of
the
festival
seems
to
have
been
to
procure
for
the
king
a
new
lease
of
life
a
renovation
of
his
divine
energies
a
rejuvenescence
in
the
inscriptions
of
abydos
we
read
after
an
account
of
the
rites
the
following
address
to
the
king
thou
dost
recommence
thy
renewal
thou
art
granted
to
flourish
again
like
the
infant
god
moon
thou
dost
grow
young
again
and
that
from
season
to
season
like
nun
at
the
beginning
of
time
thou
art
born
again
in
renewing
the
sed
festivals
all
life
comes
to
thy
nostril
and
thou
art
king
of
the
whole
earth
for
in
short
on
these
occasions
it
appears
to
have
been
supposed
that
the
king
was
in
a
manner
born
again
but
how
was
the
new
birth
effected
apparently
the
essence
of
the
rites
consisted
in
identifying
the
king
with
osiris
for
just
as
osiris
had
died
and
risen
again
from
the
dead
so
the
king
might
be
thought
to
die
and
to
live
again
with
the
god
whom
he
personated
the
ceremony
would
thus
be
for
the
king
a
death
as
well
as
a
rebirth
accordingly
in
pictures
of
the
sed
festival
on
the
monuments
we
see
the
king
posing
as
the
dead
osiris
he
sits
in
a
shrine
like
a
god
holding
in
his
hands
the
crook
and
flail
of
osiris
he
is
wrapped
in
tight
bandages
like
the
mummified
osiris
indeed
there
is
nothing
but
his
name
to
prove
that
he
is
not
osiris
himself
this
enthronement
of
the
king
in
the
attitude
of
the
dead
god
seems
to
have
been
the
principal
event
of
the
festival
further
the
queen
and
the
king
s
daughters
figured
prominently
in
the
ceremonies
a
discharge
of
arrows
formed
part
of
the
rites
and
in
some
sculptures
at
carnac
the
queen
is
portrayed
shooting
arrows
towards
the
four
quarters
of
the
world
while
the
king
does
the
same
with
rings
the
oldest
illustration
of
the
festival
is
on
the
mace
of
narmer
which
is
believed
to
date
from
here
we
see
the
king
seated
as
osiris
in
a
shrine
at
the
top
of
nine
steps
beside
the
shrine
stand
and
in
front
of
it
is
a
figure
in
a
palanquin
which
according
to
an
inscription
in
another
representation
of
the
scene
appears
to
be
the
royal
child
an
enclosure
of
curtains
hung
on
poles
surrounds
the
where
three
men
are
performing
a
sacred
dance
a
procession
of
standards
is
depicted
beside
the
enclosure
it
is
headed
by
the
standard
of
the
the
opener
of
ways
for
the
dead
similarly
on
a
seal
of
king
zer
or
rather
khent
one
of
the
early
kings
of
the
first
dynasty
the
monarch
appears
as
osiris
with
the
standard
of
the
before
him
in
front
of
him
too
is
the
ostrich
feather
on
which
the
dead
king
was
supposed
to
ascend
into
heaven
here
then
the
king
identified
with
osiris
king
of
the
dead
has
before
him
the
who
leads
the
dead
and
the
ostrich
feather
which
symbolizes
his
reception
into
the
there
are
even
grounds
for
thinking
that
in
order
to
complete
the
mimic
death
of
the
king
at
the
sed
festival
an
effigy
of
him
clad
in
the
costume
of
osiris
was
solemnly
buried
in
a
cenotaph
according
to
professor
flinders
petrie
the
conclusion
may
be
drawn
thus
in
the
savage
age
of
prehistoric
times
the
egyptians
like
many
other
african
and
indian
peoples
killed
their
at
stated
intervals
in
order
that
the
ruler
should
with
unimpaired
life
and
health
be
enabled
to
maintain
the
kingdom
in
its
highest
condition
the
royal
daughters
were
present
in
order
that
they
might
be
married
to
his
successor
the
went
before
him
to
open
the
way
to
the
unseen
world
and
the
ostrich
feather
received
and
bore
away
the
king
s
soul
in
the
breeze
that
blew
it
out
of
sight
this
was
the
celebration
of
the
end
the
feast
the
king
thus
became
the
dead
king
patron
of
all
those
who
had
died
in
his
reign
who
were
his
subjects
here
and
hereafter
he
was
thus
one
with
osiris
the
king
of
the
dead
this
fierce
custom
became
changed
as
in
other
lands
by
appointing
a
deputy
king
to
die
in
his
stead
which
idea
survived
in
the
coptic
abu
nerūs
with
his
tall
crown
of
upper
egypt
false
beard
and
sceptre
after
the
death
of
the
deputy
the
real
king
renewed
his
life
and
reign
henceforward
this
became
the
greatest
of
the
royal
festivals
the
apotheosis
of
the
king
during
his
life
after
which
he
became
osiris
upon
earth
and
the
patron
of
the
dead
in
the
a
similar
theory
of
the
sed
festival
is
maintained
by
another
eminent
egyptologist
alexandre
moret
he
says
in
most
of
the
temples
of
egypt
of
all
periods
pictures
set
forth
for
us
the
principal
scenes
of
a
solemn
festival
called
festival
of
the
tail
the
sed
festival
it
consisted
essentially
in
a
representation
of
the
ritual
death
of
the
king
followed
by
his
rebirth
in
this
case
the
king
is
identified
with
osiris
the
god
who
in
historical
times
is
the
hero
of
the
sacred
drama
of
humanity
he
who
guides
us
through
the
three
stages
of
life
death
and
rebirth
in
the
other
world
hence
clad
in
the
funeral
costume
of
osiris
with
the
garment
clinging
to
him
like
a
shroud
pharaoh
is
conducted
to
the
tomb
and
from
it
he
returns
rejuvenated
and
reborn
like
osiris
emerging
from
the
dead
how
was
this
fiction
carried
out
how
was
this
miracle
performed
by
the
sacrifice
of
human
or
animal
victims
on
behalf
of
the
king
a
priest
lay
down
in
the
skin
of
the
animal
victim
he
assumed
the
posture
characteristic
of
an
embryo
in
its
mother
s
womb
when
he
came
forth
from
the
skin
he
was
deemed
to
be
reborn
and
pharaoh
for
whom
this
rite
was
celebrated
was
himself
reborn
or
to
adopt
the
egyptian
expression
he
renewed
his
and
in
testimony
of
the
due
performance
of
the
rites
the
king
girt
his
loins
with
the
tail
a
compendious
representative
of
the
skin
of
the
sacrificed
beast
whence
the
name
of
the
festival
of
the
how
are
we
to
explain
the
rule
that
at
a
certain
point
of
his
reign
every
pharaoh
must
undergo
this
ritual
death
followed
by
fictitious
rebirth
is
it
simply
a
renewal
of
the
initiation
into
the
osirian
mysteries
or
does
the
festival
present
some
more
special
features
the
part
played
by
the
royal
children
in
these
rites
seems
to
me
to
indicate
that
the
sed
festival
represents
other
episodes
which
refer
to
the
transmission
of
the
regal
office
at
the
dawn
of
civilization
in
egypt
the
people
were
perhaps
familiar
with
the
alternative
either
of
putting
their
king
to
death
in
his
full
vigour
in
order
that
his
power
should
be
transmitted
intact
to
his
successor
or
of
attempting
to
rejuvenate
him
and
to
renew
his
the
latter
measure
was
an
invention
of
the
pharaohs
how
could
it
be
carried
out
more
effectively
than
by
identifying
themselves
with
osiris
by
applying
to
themselves
the
process
of
resurrection
the
funeral
rites
by
which
isis
according
to
the
priests
had
magically
saved
her
husband
from
death
perhaps
the
fictitious
death
of
the
king
may
be
regarded
as
a
mitigation
of
the
primitive
murder
of
the
divine
king
a
transition
from
a
barbarous
reality
to
whether
this
interpretation
of
the
sed
festival
be
accepted
in
all
its
details
or
not
one
thing
seems
quite
certain
on
these
solemn
occasions
the
god
osiris
was
personated
by
the
king
of
egypt
himself
that
is
the
point
with
which
we
are
here
chiefly
concerned
chapter
xi
the
origin
of
osiris
thus
far
we
have
discussed
the
character
of
osiris
as
he
is
presented
to
us
in
the
art
and
literature
of
egypt
and
in
the
testimonies
of
greek
writers
and
we
have
found
that
judged
by
these
indications
he
was
in
the
main
a
god
of
vegetation
and
of
the
dead
but
we
have
still
to
ask
how
did
the
conception
of
such
a
composite
deity
originate
did
it
arise
simply
through
observation
of
the
great
annual
fluctuations
of
the
seasons
and
a
desire
to
explain
them
was
it
a
result
of
brooding
over
the
mystery
of
external
nature
was
it
the
attempt
of
a
rude
philosophy
to
lift
the
veil
and
explore
the
hidden
springs
that
set
the
vast
machine
in
motion
that
man
at
a
very
early
stage
of
his
long
history
meditated
on
these
things
and
evolved
certain
crude
theories
which
partially
satisfied
his
craving
after
knowledge
is
certain
from
such
meditations
of
babylonian
and
phrygian
sages
appear
to
have
sprung
the
pathetic
figures
of
adonis
and
attis
and
from
such
meditations
of
egyptian
sages
may
have
sprung
the
tragic
figure
of
osiris
yet
a
broad
distinction
seems
to
sever
the
myth
and
worship
of
osiris
from
the
kindred
myths
and
worships
of
adonis
and
attis
for
while
adonis
and
attis
were
minor
divinities
in
the
religion
of
western
asia
completely
overshadowed
by
the
greater
deities
of
their
respective
pantheons
the
solemn
figure
of
osiris
towered
in
solitary
grandeur
over
all
the
welter
of
egyptian
gods
like
a
pyramid
of
his
native
land
lit
up
by
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
when
all
below
it
is
in
shadow
and
whereas
legend
generally
represented
adonis
and
attis
as
simple
swains
mere
herdsmen
or
hunters
whom
the
fatal
love
of
a
goddess
had
elevated
above
their
homely
sphere
into
a
brief
and
melancholy
osiris
uniformly
appears
in
tradition
as
a
great
and
beneficent
king
in
life
he
ruled
over
his
people
beloved
and
revered
for
the
benefits
he
conferred
on
them
and
on
the
world
in
death
he
reigned
in
their
hearts
and
memories
as
lord
of
the
dead
the
awful
judge
at
whose
bar
every
man
must
one
day
stand
to
give
an
account
of
the
deeds
done
in
the
body
and
to
receive
the
final
award
in
the
faith
of
the
egyptians
the
cruel
death
and
blessed
resurrection
of
osiris
occupied
the
same
place
as
the
death
and
resurrection
of
christ
hold
in
the
faith
of
christians
as
osiris
died
and
rose
again
from
the
dead
so
they
hoped
through
him
and
in
his
dear
name
to
wake
triumphant
from
the
sleep
of
death
to
a
blissful
eternity
that
was
their
in
life
s
stormy
sea
that
was
the
hope
which
supported
and
consoled
millions
of
egyptian
men
and
women
for
a
period
of
time
far
longer
than
that
during
which
christianity
has
now
existed
on
earth
in
the
long
history
of
religion
no
two
divine
figures
resemble
each
other
more
closely
in
the
fervour
of
personal
devotion
which
they
have
kindled
and
in
the
high
hopes
which
they
have
inspired
than
osiris
and
christ
the
sad
figure
of
buddha
indeed
has
been
as
deeply
loved
and
revered
by
countless
millions
but
he
had
no
glad
tidings
of
immortality
for
men
nothing
but
the
promise
of
a
final
release
from
the
burden
of
mortality
and
if
osiris
and
christ
have
been
the
centres
of
the
like
enthusiastic
devotion
may
not
the
secret
of
their
influence
have
been
similar
if
christ
lived
the
life
and
died
the
death
of
a
man
on
earth
may
not
osiris
have
done
so
likewise
the
immense
and
enduring
popularity
of
his
worship
speaks
in
favour
of
the
supposition
for
all
the
other
great
religious
or
systems
which
have
won
for
themselves
a
permanent
place
in
the
affections
of
mankind
have
been
founded
by
individual
great
men
who
by
their
personal
life
and
example
exerted
a
power
of
attraction
such
as
no
cold
abstractions
no
pale
products
of
the
collective
wisdom
or
folly
could
ever
exert
on
the
minds
and
hearts
of
humanity
thus
it
was
with
buddhism
with
confucianism
with
christianity
and
with
mohammedanism
and
thus
it
may
well
have
been
with
the
religion
of
osiris
certainly
we
shall
do
less
violence
to
the
evidence
if
we
accept
the
unanimous
tradition
of
ancient
egypt
on
this
point
than
if
we
resolve
the
figure
of
osiris
into
a
myth
pure
and
simple
and
when
we
consider
that
from
the
earliest
to
the
latest
times
egyptian
kings
were
worshipped
as
gods
both
in
life
and
in
death
there
appears
to
be
nothing
extravagant
or
improbable
in
the
view
that
one
of
them
by
his
personal
qualities
excited
a
larger
measure
of
devotion
than
usual
during
his
life
and
was
remembered
with
fonder
affection
and
deeper
reverence
after
his
death
till
in
time
his
beloved
memory
dimmed
transfigured
and
encircled
with
a
halo
of
glory
by
the
mists
of
time
grew
into
the
dominant
religion
of
his
people
at
least
this
theory
is
reasonable
enough
to
deserve
a
serious
consideration
if
we
accept
it
we
may
suppose
that
the
mythical
elements
which
legend
undoubtedly
ascribed
to
osiris
were
later
accretions
which
gathered
about
his
memory
like
ivy
about
a
ruin
there
is
no
improbability
in
such
a
supposition
on
the
contrary
all
analogy
is
in
its
favour
for
nothing
is
more
certain
than
that
myths
grow
like
weeds
round
the
great
historical
figures
of
the
past
in
recent
years
the
historical
reality
of
osiris
as
a
king
who
once
lived
and
reigned
in
egypt
has
been
maintained
by
more
than
one
learned
scholar
and
without
venturing
to
pronounce
a
decided
opinion
on
so
obscure
and
difficult
a
question
i
think
it
worth
while
following
the
example
of
wallis
budge
to
indicate
certain
modern
african
analogies
which
tend
to
confirm
the
view
that
beneath
the
mythical
wrappings
of
osiris
there
lay
the
mummy
of
a
dead
man
at
all
events
the
analogies
which
i
shall
cite
suffice
to
prove
that
the
custom
of
worshipping
dead
kings
has
not
been
confined
to
egypt
but
has
been
apparently
widespread
throughout
africa
though
the
evidence
now
at
our
disposal
only
enables
us
to
detect
the
observance
of
the
custom
at
a
few
points
of
the
great
continent
but
even
if
the
resemblance
in
this
respect
between
ancient
egypt
and
modern
africa
should
be
regarded
as
established
it
would
not
justify
us
in
inferring
an
ethnical
affinity
between
the
fair
or
ruddy
egyptians
and
the
black
aboriginal
races
who
occupy
almost
the
whole
of
africa
except
a
comparatively
narrow
fringe
on
the
northern
scholars
are
still
divided
on
the
question
of
the
original
home
and
racial
relationship
of
the
ancient
egyptians
it
has
been
held
on
the
one
hand
that
they
belong
to
an
indigenous
white
race
which
has
been
always
in
possession
of
the
mediterranean
coasts
of
africa
and
on
the
other
hand
it
has
been
supposed
that
they
are
akin
to
the
semites
in
blood
as
well
as
in
language
and
that
they
entered
africa
from
the
east
whether
by
gradual
infiltration
or
on
a
sudden
wave
of
conquest
like
the
arabs
in
the
decline
of
the
roman
empire
on
either
view
a
great
gulf
divided
them
from
the
swarthy
natives
of
the
sudan
with
whom
they
were
always
in
contact
on
their
southern
border
and
though
a
certain
admixture
may
have
taken
place
through
marriage
between
the
two
races
it
seems
unsafe
to
assume
that
the
religious
and
political
resemblances
which
can
be
traced
between
them
are
based
on
any
closer
relationship
than
the
general
similarity
in
structure
and
functions
of
the
human
mind
in
a
former
part
of
this
work
we
saw
that
the
shilluks
a
pastoral
and
partially
agricultural
people
of
the
white
nile
worship
the
spirits
of
their
dead
kings
the
graves
of
the
deceased
monarchs
form
indeed
the
national
or
tribal
temples
and
as
each
king
is
interred
at
the
village
where
he
was
born
and
where
his
afterbirth
is
buried
these
are
scattered
over
the
country
each
of
them
usually
comprises
a
small
group
of
round
huts
resembling
the
common
houses
of
the
people
the
whole
being
enclosed
by
a
fence
one
of
the
huts
is
built
over
the
grave
the
others
are
occupied
by
the
guardians
of
the
shrine
who
at
first
are
generally
the
widows
or
old
of
the
deceased
king
when
these
women
or
retainers
die
they
are
succeeded
in
office
by
their
descendants
for
the
tombs
are
maintained
in
perpetuity
so
that
the
number
of
temples
and
of
gods
is
always
on
the
increase
cattle
are
dedicated
to
these
royal
shrines
and
animals
sacrificed
at
them
for
example
when
the
millet
crop
threatens
to
fail
or
a
murrain
breaks
out
among
the
beasts
one
of
the
dead
kings
will
appear
to
somebody
in
a
dream
and
demand
a
sacrifice
the
dream
is
reported
to
the
king
and
he
immediately
orders
a
bullock
and
a
cow
to
be
sent
to
the
grave
of
the
dead
king
who
appeared
in
a
vision
of
the
night
to
the
sleeper
this
is
done
the
bullock
is
killed
and
the
cow
added
to
the
sacred
herd
of
the
shrine
it
is
customary
also
though
not
necessary
at
harvest
to
offer
some
of
the
new
millet
at
the
of
the
kings
and
sick
people
send
animals
to
be
sacrificed
there
on
their
behalf
special
regard
is
paid
to
trees
that
grow
near
the
graves
of
the
kings
and
the
spirits
of
the
departed
monarchs
are
believed
to
appear
from
time
to
time
in
the
form
of
certain
animals
one
of
them
for
example
always
takes
the
shape
of
a
certain
insect
which
seems
to
be
the
larva
of
the
when
a
shilluk
finds
one
of
these
insects
he
will
take
it
up
in
his
hands
and
deposit
it
reverentially
at
the
shrine
other
kings
manifest
themselves
as
a
certain
species
of
white
birds
others
assume
the
form
of
giraffes
when
one
of
these
and
creatures
comes
stalking
up
fearlessly
to
a
village
where
there
is
a
king
s
grave
the
people
know
that
the
king
s
soul
is
in
the
animal
and
the
attendants
at
the
royal
tomb
testify
their
joy
at
the
appearance
of
their
master
by
sacrificing
a
sheep
or
even
a
bullock
but
of
all
the
dead
kings
none
is
revered
so
deeply
or
occupies
so
large
a
place
in
the
minds
of
the
people
as
nyakang
the
traditional
founder
of
the
dynasty
and
the
ancestor
of
all
the
kings
who
have
reigned
after
him
to
the
present
day
of
these
kings
the
shilluks
have
preserved
the
memory
and
the
genealogy
seem
to
have
sat
on
the
throne
since
nyakang
but
the
period
of
time
covered
by
their
reigns
is
much
shorter
than
it
would
have
been
under
conditions
such
as
now
prevail
in
europe
for
down
to
the
time
when
their
country
came
under
british
rule
it
was
the
regular
custom
of
the
shilluks
to
put
their
kings
to
death
as
soon
as
they
showed
serious
symptoms
of
bodily
or
mental
decay
the
custom
was
based
on
the
conviction
that
the
king
must
not
be
allowed
to
become
ill
or
senile
lest
with
his
diminishing
vigour
the
cattle
should
sicken
and
fail
to
bear
their
increase
the
crops
should
rot
in
the
fields
and
man
stricken
with
disease
should
die
in
it
is
said
that
nyakang
like
romulus
disappeared
in
a
great
storm
which
scattered
all
the
people
about
him
in
their
absence
the
king
took
a
cloth
tied
it
tightly
round
his
neck
and
strangled
himself
according
to
one
account
that
is
the
death
which
all
his
successors
on
the
throne
have
died
but
while
tradition
appears
to
be
unanimous
as
to
the
custom
of
regicide
it
varies
as
to
the
precise
mode
in
which
the
kings
were
relieved
of
their
office
and
of
life
but
still
the
people
are
convinced
that
nyakang
did
not
really
die
but
only
vanished
mysteriously
away
like
the
wind
when
a
missionary
asked
the
shilluks
as
to
the
manner
of
nyakang
s
death
they
were
filled
with
amazement
at
his
ignorance
and
stoutly
maintained
that
he
never
died
for
were
he
to
die
all
the
shilluks
would
die
also
the
graves
of
this
deified
king
are
shown
in
various
parts
of
the
country
from
time
to
time
the
spirit
of
nyakang
manifests
itself
to
his
people
in
the
form
of
an
animal
any
creature
of
regal
port
or
surpassing
beauty
may
serve
as
his
temporary
incarnation
such
among
wild
animals
are
lions
crocodiles
little
yellow
snakes
that
crawl
about
men
s
houses
the
finest
sorts
of
antelopes
flamingoes
with
their
and
scarlet
plumage
and
butterflies
of
all
sorts
with
their
brilliant
and
varied
hues
an
unusually
fine
head
of
cattle
is
also
recognized
as
the
abode
of
the
great
king
s
soul
for
example
he
once
appeared
in
the
shape
of
a
white
bull
whereupon
the
living
king
commanded
special
sacrifices
to
be
offered
in
honour
of
his
deified
predecessor
when
a
bird
in
which
the
royal
spirit
is
known
to
be
lodged
lights
on
a
tree
that
tree
becomes
sacred
to
nyakang
beads
and
cloths
are
hung
on
its
boughs
sacrifices
and
prayers
are
offered
below
it
once
when
the
turks
unknowingly
felled
such
a
tree
fear
and
horror
fell
on
the
shilluks
who
beheld
the
sacrilege
they
filled
the
air
with
lamentations
and
killed
an
ox
to
appease
their
insulted
ancestor
particular
regard
is
also
paid
to
trees
that
grow
near
the
graves
of
nyakang
though
they
are
not
regularly
worshipped
in
one
place
two
gigantic
baobab
trees
are
pointed
out
as
marking
the
spot
where
nyakang
once
stood
and
sacrifices
are
now
offered
under
their
spreading
shade
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
in
spite
of
the
mythical
elements
which
have
gathered
round
his
memory
nyakang
was
a
real
man
who
led
the
shilluks
to
their
present
home
on
the
nile
either
from
the
west
or
from
the
south
for
on
this
point
tradition
varies
the
first
and
most
important
ancestor
who
is
everywhere
revered
is
nyakang
the
first
shilluk
king
he
always
receives
the
honourable
titles
of
father
ancestor
king
or
kings
ancestors
and
great
man
above
duong
to
distinguish
him
from
the
other
great
men
on
earth
nyakang
as
we
know
was
an
historical
personage
he
led
the
shilluks
to
the
land
which
they
now
occupy
he
helped
them
to
victory
made
them
great
and
warlike
regulated
marriage
and
law
distributed
the
country
among
them
divided
it
into
districts
and
in
order
to
increase
the
dependence
of
the
people
on
him
and
to
show
them
his
power
became
their
greatest
benefactor
by
giving
himself
out
as
the
bestower
of
yet
nyakang
is
now
universally
revered
by
the
people
as
a
indeed
for
all
practical
purposes
his
worship
quite
eclipses
that
of
the
supreme
god
juok
the
creator
who
having
ordered
the
world
committed
it
to
the
care
of
ancestral
spirits
and
demons
and
now
dwelling
aloft
concerns
himself
no
further
with
human
affairs
hence
men
pay
little
heed
to
their
creator
and
seldom
take
his
name
into
their
lips
except
in
a
few
conventional
forms
of
salutation
at
meeting
and
parting
like
our
far
otherwise
is
it
with
nyakang
he
is
the
ancestor
of
the
shilluk
nation
and
the
founder
of
the
shilluk
dynasty
he
is
worshipped
sacrifices
and
prayers
are
offered
to
him
he
may
be
said
to
be
lifted
to
the
rank
of
a
though
they
never
forget
that
he
has
been
a
real
man
he
is
expressly
designated
as
little
in
comparison
with
yet
in
the
political
religious
and
personal
life
nyakang
takes
a
far
more
important
place
than
juok
nyakang
is
the
national
hero
of
whom
each
shilluk
feels
proud
who
is
praised
in
innumerable
popular
songs
and
sayings
he
is
not
only
a
superior
being
but
also
a
man
he
is
the
sublime
model
for
every
true
shilluk
everything
they
value
most
in
their
national
and
private
life
has
its
origin
in
him
their
kingdom
and
their
fighting
as
well
as
and
farming
while
nyakang
is
their
good
father
who
only
does
them
good
juok
is
the
great
uncontrollable
power
which
is
to
be
propitiated
in
order
to
avoid
his
inflictions
of
indeed
the
whole
working
religion
of
the
shilluk
is
a
cult
of
nyakang
the
ancestor
of
their
kings
in
each
of
whom
his
spirit
is
the
transmission
of
the
divine
or
spirit
of
nyakang
to
the
reigning
monarch
appears
to
take
place
at
the
king
s
installation
and
to
be
effected
by
means
of
a
rude
wooden
effigy
of
nyakang
in
which
the
spirit
of
that
deified
man
is
perhaps
supposed
to
be
immanent
but
however
the
spiritual
transmission
may
be
carried
out
the
fundamental
idea
of
the
cult
of
the
shilluk
divine
kings
is
the
immanence
in
each
of
the
spirit
of
thus
the
shilluk
kings
are
encircled
with
a
certain
halo
of
divinity
because
they
are
thought
to
be
animated
by
the
divine
spirit
of
their
ancestor
the
founder
of
the
dynasty
the
universal
belief
of
the
shilluks
in
the
former
humanity
of
nyakang
is
strongly
confirmed
by
the
exact
parallelism
which
prevails
between
his
worship
and
that
of
the
dead
kings
his
successors
like
them
he
is
worshipped
at
his
tomb
but
unlike
them
he
has
not
one
tomb
only
but
ten
scattered
over
the
country
each
of
these
tombs
is
called
the
grave
of
nyakang
though
the
people
well
know
that
nobody
is
buried
there
like
the
of
the
other
kings
those
of
nyakang
consist
of
a
small
group
of
circular
huts
of
the
ordinary
pattern
enclosed
by
a
fence
only
children
under
puberty
and
the
few
old
people
whose
duty
it
is
to
take
care
of
the
shrines
may
enter
these
sacred
enclosures
the
rites
performed
at
them
resemble
those
observed
at
the
shrines
of
the
kings
two
great
ceremonies
are
annually
performed
at
the
shrines
of
nyakang
one
is
observed
before
the
beginning
of
the
rainy
season
in
order
to
ensure
a
due
supply
of
rain
the
other
is
a
thanksgiving
at
harvest
when
porridge
made
from
the
new
grain
is
poured
out
on
the
threshold
of
nyakang
s
hut
and
smeared
on
the
outer
walls
of
the
building
even
before
the
millet
is
reaped
the
people
cut
some
of
the
ripening
ears
and
thrust
them
into
the
thatch
of
the
sacred
hut
thus
it
would
seem
that
the
shilluks
believe
themselves
to
be
dependent
on
the
favour
of
nyakang
for
the
rain
and
the
crops
as
the
giver
of
rain
nyakang
is
the
first
and
greatest
benefactor
of
the
people
in
that
country
rain
is
everything
without
rain
there
is
nothing
the
shilluk
does
not
trouble
his
head
about
artificial
irrigation
he
waits
for
the
rain
if
the
rain
falls
then
the
millet
grows
the
cows
thrive
man
has
food
and
can
dance
and
marry
for
that
is
the
ideal
of
the
sick
people
also
bring
or
send
sheep
as
an
offering
to
the
nearest
shrine
of
nyakang
in
order
that
they
may
be
healed
of
their
sickness
the
attendants
of
the
sanctuary
slaughter
the
animal
consume
its
flesh
and
give
the
sufferer
the
benefit
of
their
prayers
the
example
of
nyakang
seems
to
show
that
under
favourable
circumstances
the
worship
of
a
dead
king
may
develop
into
the
dominant
religion
of
a
people
there
is
therefore
no
intrinsic
improbability
in
the
view
that
in
ancient
egypt
the
religion
of
osiris
originated
in
that
way
certainly
some
curious
resemblances
can
be
traced
between
the
dead
nyakang
and
the
dead
osiris
both
died
violent
and
mysterious
deaths
the
graves
of
both
were
pointed
out
in
many
parts
of
the
country
both
were
deemed
the
great
sources
of
fertility
for
the
whole
land
and
both
were
associated
with
certain
sacred
trees
and
animals
particularly
with
bulls
and
just
as
egyptian
kings
identified
themselves
both
in
life
and
in
death
with
their
deified
predecessor
osiris
so
shilluk
kings
are
still
believed
to
be
animated
by
the
spirit
of
their
deified
predecessor
nyakang
and
to
share
his
divinity
another
african
people
who
regularly
worship
or
rather
used
to
worship
the
spirits
of
their
dead
kings
are
the
baganda
their
country
uganda
lies
at
the
very
source
of
the
nile
where
the
great
river
issues
from
lake
victoria
nyanza
among
them
the
ghosts
of
dead
kings
were
placed
on
an
equality
with
the
gods
and
received
the
same
honour
and
worship
they
foretold
events
which
concerned
the
state
and
they
advised
the
living
king
warning
him
when
war
was
likely
to
break
out
the
king
consulted
them
periodically
visiting
first
one
and
then
another
of
the
temples
in
which
the
mortal
remains
of
his
predecessors
were
preserved
with
religious
care
but
the
temple
of
a
king
contained
only
his
lower
jawbone
and
his
his
body
was
buried
elsewhere
for
curiously
enough
the
baganda
believed
that
the
part
of
the
body
to
which
the
ghost
of
a
dead
man
adheres
above
all
others
is
the
lower
jawbone
wherever
that
portion
of
his
person
may
be
carried
the
ghost
in
the
opinion
of
these
people
will
follow
it
even
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
will
be
perfectly
content
to
remain
with
it
so
long
as
the
jawbone
is
honoured
hence
the
jawbones
of
all
the
kings
of
uganda
from
the
earliest
times
to
the
present
day
have
been
preserved
with
the
utmost
care
each
of
them
being
deposited
along
with
the
stump
of
the
monarch
s
in
a
temple
specially
dedicated
to
the
worship
of
the
king
s
ghost
for
it
is
believed
that
the
ghosts
of
the
deceased
monarchs
would
quarrel
if
they
shared
the
same
temple
the
question
of
precedence
being
one
which
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
them
to
adjust
to
their
mutual
satisfaction
all
the
temples
of
the
dead
kings
stand
in
the
district
called
busiro
which
means
the
place
of
the
graves
because
the
tombs
as
well
as
the
temples
of
the
departed
potentates
are
situated
within
its
boundaries
the
supervision
of
the
temples
and
of
the
estates
attached
to
them
was
a
duty
incumbent
on
the
or
earl
of
busiro
one
of
the
few
hereditary
chiefs
in
the
country
his
principal
office
was
that
of
prime
minister
to
the
dead
kings
when
a
king
dies
his
body
is
sent
to
busiro
and
there
embalmed
then
it
is
laid
to
rest
in
a
large
round
house
which
has
been
built
for
its
reception
on
the
top
of
a
hill
this
is
the
king
s
tomb
it
is
a
conical
structure
supported
by
a
central
post
with
a
thatched
roof
reaching
down
to
the
ground
round
the
hut
a
high
strong
fence
of
reeds
is
erected
and
an
outer
fence
encircles
the
whole
at
some
distance
lower
down
the
hill
here
the
body
is
placed
on
a
bedstead
the
sepulchral
chamber
is
filled
with
bark
cloths
till
it
can
hold
no
more
the
mainpost
is
cut
down
and
the
door
of
the
tomb
closed
so
that
no
one
can
enter
it
again
when
that
was
done
the
wives
of
the
late
king
used
to
be
brought
with
their
arms
pinioned
and
placed
at
intervals
round
the
outer
wall
of
the
tomb
where
they
were
clubbed
to
death
hundreds
of
men
were
also
killed
in
the
space
between
the
two
fences
that
their
ghosts
might
wait
on
the
ghost
of
the
dead
king
in
the
other
world
none
of
their
bodies
were
buried
they
were
left
to
rot
where
they
fell
then
the
gates
in
the
fences
were
closed
and
three
chiefs
with
their
men
guarded
the
dead
bodies
from
the
wild
beasts
and
the
vultures
but
the
hut
in
which
the
king
s
body
reposed
was
never
repaired
it
was
allowed
to
moulder
and
fall
into
decay
five
months
later
the
jawbone
of
the
royal
corpse
was
removed
in
order
to
be
fashioned
into
an
effigy
or
representative
of
the
dead
king
for
this
purpose
three
chiefs
entered
the
tomb
not
through
the
door
but
by
cutting
a
hole
through
the
wall
and
having
severed
the
head
from
the
body
they
brought
it
out
carefully
filling
up
the
hole
in
the
wall
behind
them
replacing
the
thatch
and
securing
the
gates
in
the
fence
when
the
jawbone
had
been
removed
by
a
chief
of
the
civet
clan
the
skull
was
sent
back
to
busiro
and
buried
with
honour
near
the
mouldering
tomb
in
contrast
to
the
neglect
of
the
tomb
where
the
royal
body
lay
the
place
where
the
skull
was
buried
was
kept
in
good
repair
and
guarded
by
some
of
the
old
princesses
and
widows
as
for
the
jawbone
it
was
put
in
an
and
left
there
till
the
ants
had
eaten
away
all
the
flesh
then
after
it
had
been
washed
in
beer
and
milk
it
was
decorated
with
and
placed
in
a
wooden
vessel
this
vessel
was
next
wrapt
in
bark
cloths
till
it
assumed
a
conical
shape
about
two
and
a
half
feet
high
by
a
foot
and
a
half
broad
at
the
base
this
conical
packet
decorated
on
the
outside
with
beads
was
treated
as
an
image
of
the
deceased
king
or
rather
as
if
it
were
the
king
himself
in
life
for
it
was
called
simply
the
beside
it
was
placed
the
stump
of
the
king
s
similarly
wrapt
in
bark
cloths
and
decorated
though
not
made
up
into
a
conical
shape
the
reason
for
preserving
both
the
jawbone
and
the
was
that
the
ghost
of
the
king
was
supposed
to
attach
itself
to
his
jawbone
and
the
ghost
of
his
double
to
his
for
in
the
belief
of
the
baganda
every
person
has
a
double
namely
the
afterbirth
or
placenta
which
is
born
immediately
after
him
and
is
regarded
by
the
people
as
a
second
child
now
that
double
has
a
ghost
of
its
own
which
adheres
to
the
and
if
the
person
is
to
remain
healthy
it
is
essential
that
the
ghost
of
his
double
should
be
carefully
preserved
hence
every
baganda
man
and
woman
keeps
his
or
her
wrapt
up
in
bark
cloth
as
a
treasure
of
great
price
on
which
his
health
and
prosperity
are
dependent
the
precious
little
bundle
is
called
his
twin
because
it
contains
the
ghost
of
his
double
the
afterbirth
if
that
is
deemed
necessary
for
everybody
much
more
is
it
deemed
essential
for
the
welfare
of
the
king
hence
during
his
life
the
stump
of
his
is
kept
as
we
saw
by
one
of
the
principal
ministers
of
state
and
is
inspected
by
the
king
himself
every
month
and
when
his
majesty
has
departed
this
life
the
unity
of
his
spirit
imperatively
demands
that
his
own
ghost
and
the
ghost
of
his
double
should
be
kept
together
in
the
same
place
that
is
why
the
jawbone
and
the
of
every
dead
king
are
carefully
preserved
in
the
same
temple
because
the
two
ghosts
adhere
respectively
to
these
two
parts
of
his
person
and
it
would
be
unreasonable
and
indeed
cruel
to
divide
them
the
two
ghosts
having
been
thus
safely
lodged
in
the
two
precious
parcels
the
next
thing
was
to
install
them
in
the
temple
where
they
were
to
enter
on
their
career
of
beneficent
activity
a
site
having
been
chosen
the
whole
country
supplied
the
labour
necessary
for
building
the
temple
and
ministers
were
appointed
to
wait
upon
the
dead
king
the
officers
of
state
who
had
held
important
posts
during
his
life
retained
their
titles
and
continued
to
discharge
their
duties
towards
their
old
master
in
death
accordingly
houses
were
built
for
them
near
the
temple
the
dowager
queen
also
took
up
her
residence
at
the
entrance
to
the
temple
enclosure
and
became
its
principal
guardian
many
also
of
the
king
s
widows
of
lower
rank
were
drafted
off
to
live
inside
the
enclosure
and
keep
watch
over
it
when
the
queen
or
any
of
these
widows
died
her
place
was
supplied
by
another
princess
or
a
woman
of
the
same
clan
for
the
temple
was
maintained
in
perpetuity
however
when
the
reigning
king
died
the
temple
of
his
predecessor
lost
much
of
its
importance
though
it
was
still
kept
up
in
a
less
magnificent
style
indeed
no
temple
of
a
dead
king
was
allowed
to
disappear
altogether
of
all
the
attendants
at
the
temple
the
most
important
probably
was
the
prophet
or
medium
whose
business
it
was
from
time
to
time
to
be
inspired
by
the
ghost
of
the
deceased
monarch
and
to
give
oracles
in
his
name
to
this
holy
office
he
dedicated
himself
by
drinking
a
draught
of
beer
and
a
draught
of
milk
out
of
the
dead
king
s
skull
the
temple
consecrated
to
the
worship
of
a
king
regularly
stood
on
a
hill
the
site
was
generally
chosen
by
the
king
in
his
life
but
sometimes
his
choice
was
set
aside
by
his
successor
who
gave
orders
to
build
the
temple
in
another
place
the
structure
was
a
large
conical
or
hut
of
the
ordinary
pattern
divided
internally
into
two
chambers
an
outer
and
an
inner
any
person
might
enter
the
outer
chamber
but
the
inner
was
sacred
and
no
profane
person
might
set
foot
in
it
for
there
the
holy
relics
of
the
dead
king
his
jawbone
and
his
were
kept
for
safety
in
a
cell
dug
in
the
floor
and
there
in
close
attendance
on
them
the
king
s
ghost
was
believed
to
dwell
in
front
of
the
partition
which
screened
this
holy
of
holies
from
the
gaze
of
the
multitude
there
stood
a
throne
covered
with
lion
and
leopard
skins
and
fenced
off
from
the
rest
of
the
sacred
edifice
by
a
glittering
rail
of
brass
spears
shields
and
knives
a
forest
of
poles
supporting
the
roof
formed
a
series
of
aisles
in
perfect
line
and
at
the
end
of
the
central
nave
appeared
like
the
altar
of
a
christian
church
the
throne
in
all
its
glory
when
the
king
s
ghost
held
a
reception
the
holy
relics
the
jawbone
and
the
each
in
its
decorated
wrappings
were
brought
forth
and
set
on
the
throne
and
every
person
who
entered
the
temple
bowed
to
the
ground
and
greeted
the
jawbone
in
an
awestruck
voice
for
he
regarded
it
as
the
king
in
person
solemn
music
played
during
the
reception
the
drums
rolling
and
the
women
chanting
while
they
clapped
their
hands
to
the
rhythm
of
the
songs
sometimes
the
dead
king
spoke
to
the
congregation
by
the
voice
of
his
prophet
that
was
a
great
event
when
the
oracle
was
about
to
be
given
to
the
expectant
throng
the
prophet
stepped
up
to
the
throne
and
addressing
the
spirit
informed
him
of
the
business
in
hand
then
he
smoked
one
or
two
pipes
and
the
fumes
bringing
on
the
prophetic
fit
he
began
to
rave
and
to
speak
in
the
very
voice
and
with
the
characteristic
turns
of
speech
of
the
departed
monarch
for
the
king
s
spirit
was
now
in
him
this
message
from
the
world
beyond
the
grave
was
naturally
received
with
rapt
attention
gradually
the
fit
of
inspiration
passed
the
voice
of
the
prophet
resumed
its
natural
tones
the
spirit
had
departed
from
him
and
returned
to
its
abode
in
the
inner
room
such
a
solemn
audience
used
to
be
announced
beforehand
by
the
beating
of
the
drums
in
the
early
morning
and
the
worshippers
brought
with
them
to
the
temple
offerings
of
food
for
the
dead
king
as
if
he
were
still
alive
but
the
greatest
day
of
all
was
when
the
reigning
king
visited
the
temple
of
his
father
this
he
did
as
a
rule
only
once
during
his
reign
nor
did
the
people
approve
of
the
visits
being
repeated
for
each
visit
was
the
signal
for
the
death
of
many
yet
attracted
by
a
painful
curiosity
crowds
assembled
followed
the
monarch
to
the
temple
and
thronged
to
see
the
great
ceremony
of
the
meeting
between
the
king
and
the
ghost
of
his
royal
father
the
sacred
relics
were
displayed
an
old
man
explained
them
to
the
monarch
and
placed
them
in
his
hands
the
prophet
inspired
by
the
dead
king
s
spirit
revealed
to
the
living
king
his
destiny
the
interview
over
the
king
was
carried
back
to
his
house
it
was
on
the
return
journey
that
he
always
gave
suddenly
and
without
warning
the
signal
of
death
obedient
to
his
orders
the
guards
rushed
upon
the
crowd
captured
hundreds
of
spectators
pinioned
them
marched
them
back
to
the
temple
and
slaughtered
them
within
the
precincts
that
their
ghosts
might
wait
on
the
ghost
of
the
dead
king
but
though
the
king
rarely
visited
his
father
s
ghost
at
the
temple
he
had
a
private
chapel
for
the
ghost
within
the
vast
enclosure
of
the
royal
residence
and
here
he
often
paid
his
devotions
to
the
august
spirit
of
whom
he
stood
greatly
in
awe
he
took
his
wives
with
him
to
sing
the
departed
monarch
s
praise
and
he
constantly
made
offerings
at
the
shrine
thither
too
would
come
the
prophet
to
suck
words
of
wisdom
from
the
venerable
ghost
and
to
impart
them
to
the
king
who
thus
walked
in
the
counsel
of
his
glorified
father
in
kiziba
a
district
of
central
africa
on
the
western
side
of
lake
victoria
nyanza
the
souls
of
dead
kings
become
ruling
spirits
temples
are
built
in
their
honour
and
priests
appointed
to
serve
them
the
people
are
composed
of
two
different
races
the
bairu
who
are
aboriginals
and
the
bahima
who
are
immigrants
from
the
north
the
royal
family
belongs
to
the
bahima
stock
in
his
lifetime
the
king
s
person
is
sacred
and
all
his
actions
property
and
so
forth
are
described
by
special
terms
appropriated
to
that
purpose
the
people
are
divided
into
totemic
clans
the
totems
are
mostly
animals
or
parts
of
animals
no
man
may
kill
or
eat
his
totem
animal
nor
marry
a
woman
who
has
the
same
totem
as
himself
the
royal
family
seems
to
have
serpents
for
their
totem
after
death
the
king
s
soul
lives
in
a
serpent
while
his
body
is
buried
in
the
hut
where
he
died
the
people
revere
a
supreme
god
named
rugaba
who
is
believed
to
have
created
man
and
cattle
but
they
know
little
about
him
and
though
they
occasionally
pray
to
him
particularly
in
the
case
of
a
difficult
birth
he
has
no
priests
and
receives
no
sacrifices
the
business
of
the
priests
is
to
act
as
intermediaries
not
between
god
and
man
but
between
men
and
the
spirits
the
spirits
are
believed
to
have
been
formerly
kings
of
the
world
the
highest
of
them
is
a
certain
wamara
who
rules
over
the
souls
of
the
dead
and
who
would
seem
to
have
been
a
great
king
in
his
life
temples
are
built
for
him
they
are
like
the
houses
of
men
but
only
half
as
large
a
perpetual
holy
fire
is
kept
up
in
each
temple
and
the
priest
passes
the
night
in
it
he
receives
white
sheep
or
goats
as
victims
and
generally
acts
also
as
a
diviner
or
physician
when
a
man
is
very
ill
he
thinks
that
wamara
the
lord
of
the
spirits
of
the
dead
is
summoning
him
to
the
far
country
so
he
sends
a
sacrifice
to
wamara
s
priest
who
prays
to
the
spirit
to
let
the
sick
man
live
yet
a
while
this
great
spirit
of
an
ancient
king
who
now
rules
over
the
dead
resembles
the
egyptian
osiris
the
bantu
tribes
who
inhabit
the
great
tableland
of
northern
rhodesia
revere
a
supreme
being
whom
they
call
leza
but
their
ideas
about
him
are
hazy
thunder
lightning
earthquakes
rain
and
other
natural
phenomena
are
grouped
together
under
his
name
as
manifestations
of
his
power
among
the
more
progressive
tribes
such
as
the
awemba
and
the
wabisa
the
great
god
is
thought
to
take
some
interest
in
human
affairs
and
though
they
do
not
pray
to
him
they
nevertheless
invoke
him
by
his
names
of
praise
which
set
forth
his
attributes
as
the
protector
and
judge
of
mankind
it
is
he
too
who
receives
the
souls
of
the
departed
yet
as
far
as
the
dominant
wemba
tribe
is
concerned
the
cult
of
leza
is
outside
their
ordinary
religion
there
is
no
direct
access
to
him
by
prayer
or
by
sacrifices
which
are
made
to
mulenga
and
the
other
great
tribal
and
ancestral
spirits
instead
for
upon
such
animism
is
founded
the
whole
fabric
of
wemba
the
ancestral
spirits
whom
the
awemba
and
all
other
tribes
of
this
region
worship
may
be
divided
into
two
main
classes
first
come
the
spirits
of
departed
chiefs
who
are
publicly
worshipped
by
the
whole
tribe
and
second
come
the
spirits
of
near
relations
who
are
worshipped
privately
by
each
head
of
a
family
among
the
awemba
there
is
no
special
shrine
for
these
purely
family
spirits
who
are
worshipped
inside
the
hut
and
to
whom
family
sacrifice
of
a
sheep
a
goat
or
a
fowl
is
made
the
spirit
receiving
the
blood
spilt
on
the
ground
while
all
the
members
of
the
family
partake
of
the
flesh
together
for
a
religious
wemba
man
the
cult
of
the
spirit
of
his
nearest
relations
of
his
grandparents
or
of
his
deceased
father
mother
elder
brother
or
maternal
uncle
is
considered
quite
sufficient
out
of
these
spirit
relatives
a
man
will
worship
one
whom
he
considers
as
his
special
familiar
for
various
reasons
for
instance
the
diviner
may
have
told
him
that
his
last
illness
was
caused
because
he
had
not
respected
the
spirit
of
his
uncle
accordingly
he
will
be
careful
in
future
to
adopt
his
uncle
as
his
tutelary
spirit
as
a
mark
of
such
respect
he
may
devote
a
cow
or
a
goat
to
one
of
the
spirits
of
his
ancestors
holding
the
fowl
for
instance
in
his
hands
he
will
dedicate
it
asking
the
spirit
to
come
and
abide
in
it
upon
which
the
fowl
is
let
go
and
is
afterwards
called
by
the
name
of
the
spirit
if
the
necessities
however
of
the
larder
demand
that
it
should
be
killed
another
animal
is
taken
and
the
spirit
is
asked
to
accept
it
as
a
substitute
before
beginning
any
special
task
such
as
hoeing
a
new
garden
or
going
on
a
journey
wemba
men
invoke
their
tutelary
spirits
to
be
with
them
and
to
assist
their
efforts
in
short
ejaculatory
prayers
usually
couched
in
a
set
formula
among
many
of
the
tribes
in
the
north
luangwa
district
longer
formal
prayers
are
still
made
to
all
the
deceased
ancestors
of
the
clan
at
the
time
of
harvest
asking
them
to
protect
the
crops
and
to
drive
away
illnesses
and
evil
spirits
from
the
family
which
honours
them
with
libations
of
beer
and
offerings
of
the
thus
among
these
tribes
who
all
belong
to
the
great
bantu
family
the
public
worship
which
a
whole
tribe
pays
to
the
souls
of
its
dead
chiefs
is
probably
nothing
but
an
extension
of
the
private
worship
which
every
family
pays
privately
to
the
souls
of
its
dead
members
and
just
as
the
members
of
his
family
whom
a
man
worships
privately
are
not
mythical
beings
conjured
up
by
imagination
out
of
a
distant
past
but
were
once
real
men
like
himself
whom
he
knew
in
life
it
may
be
his
father
or
uncle
or
elder
brother
so
we
may
be
sure
that
in
like
manner
the
dead
chiefs
revered
by
the
whole
tribe
are
not
creations
of
the
mythical
fancy
but
were
once
real
men
of
flesh
and
blood
who
ruled
over
the
tribe
and
whose
memory
has
been
more
or
less
faithfully
preserved
by
tradition
in
this
respect
the
tribes
of
northern
rhodesia
are
typical
of
all
the
tribes
of
that
great
bantu
family
which
occupies
nearly
the
whole
southern
half
of
africa
from
the
great
equatorial
lakes
to
the
cape
of
good
hope
the
main
practical
religion
of
all
these
numerous
and
widespread
peoples
appears
to
be
the
worship
of
their
ancestors
to
adduce
in
full
the
evidence
which
points
to
this
conclusion
would
lead
us
too
far
from
our
present
subject
it
must
suffice
to
cite
a
few
typical
statements
of
competent
authorities
which
refer
to
different
tribes
of
the
bantu
stock
speaking
with
special
reference
to
the
tribes
of
africa
the
rev
james
macdonald
tells
us
that
the
religion
of
the
bantu
which
they
not
only
profess
but
really
regulate
their
conduct
by
is
based
on
the
belief
that
the
spirits
of
their
ancestors
interfere
constantly
in
their
affairs
every
man
worships
his
own
ancestors
and
offers
sacrifices
to
avert
their
wrath
the
clan
worships
the
spirits
of
the
ancestors
of
its
chiefs
and
the
tribe
worships
the
spirits
of
the
ancestors
of
the
paramount
the
religion
of
the
bantu
was
based
upon
the
supposition
of
the
existence
of
spirits
that
could
interfere
with
the
affairs
of
this
world
these
spirits
were
those
of
their
ancestors
and
their
deceased
chiefs
the
greatest
of
whom
had
control
over
lightning
when
the
spirits
became
offended
or
hungry
they
sent
a
plague
or
disaster
until
sacrifices
were
offered
and
their
wrath
or
hunger
was
appeased
the
head
of
a
family
of
commoners
on
such
an
occasion
killed
an
animal
and
all
ate
of
the
meat
as
the
hungry
ghost
was
supposed
to
be
satisfied
with
the
for
example
in
the
year
the
son
of
a
chief
of
the
pondomisi
tribe
was
arrested
for
an
assault
and
sent
for
trial
before
a
colonial
court
it
chanced
to
be
a
season
of
intense
heat
and
severe
drought
and
the
pondomisi
tribe
attributed
these
calamities
to
the
wrath
of
a
dead
chief
named
gwanya
very
famous
in
his
lifetime
whose
body
fastened
to
a
log
had
been
buried
under
a
heap
of
stones
in
a
deep
pool
of
the
lina
river
this
redoubtable
chieftain
was
the
seventh
ancestor
in
the
direct
line
of
the
man
who
had
committed
the
assault
and
he
warmly
resented
the
indignity
which
the
whites
had
done
to
a
noble
scion
of
his
house
by
consigning
him
to
durance
vile
to
appease
the
natural
indignation
of
the
ghost
the
tribesmen
killed
cattle
on
the
banks
of
the
pool
which
contained
his
grave
and
threw
the
flesh
into
the
water
along
with
new
dishes
full
of
beer
the
prisoner
however
was
convicted
of
the
assault
and
sentenced
by
the
ruthless
magistrate
who
was
no
respecter
of
ghosts
to
pay
a
fine
but
the
tribe
clubbed
together
and
paid
the
fine
for
him
and
a
few
days
later
rain
fell
in
plenty
the
mollified
ghost
had
opened
the
celestial
sluices
another
writer
describing
the
religion
of
the
south
african
bantus
tells
us
that
the
ancestral
spirits
love
the
very
things
they
loved
before
they
passed
through
the
flesh
they
cherish
the
same
desires
and
have
the
same
antipathies
the
living
can
not
add
to
the
number
of
the
wives
of
ancestral
spirits
but
they
can
kill
cattle
in
their
honour
and
keep
their
praise
and
memory
alive
on
earth
above
all
things
they
can
give
them
beef
and
beer
and
if
the
living
do
not
give
them
sufficient
of
these
things
the
spirits
are
supposed
to
give
the
people
a
bad
time
they
send
drought
and
sickness
and
famine
until
people
kill
cattle
in
their
honour
when
men
are
alive
they
love
to
be
praised
and
flattered
fed
and
attended
to
after
death
they
want
the
very
same
things
for
death
does
not
change
personality
in
time
of
drought
or
sickness
or
great
trouble
there
would
be
great
searchings
of
heart
as
to
which
ancestor
had
been
neglected
for
the
trouble
would
be
supposed
to
be
caused
by
the
neglected
ancestor
most
of
the
people
would
get
the
subject
on
their
nerves
at
least
as
far
as
a
kafir
could
get
anything
on
the
leather
strings
which
do
duty
for
nerves
and
some
one
would
be
sure
to
have
a
vivid
dream
in
which
an
ancestor
would
complain
that
the
people
had
not
praised
him
half
enough
of
late
so
an
ox
would
be
killed
either
by
the
of
the
kraal
or
by
a
diviner
then
the
man
would
say
over
the
ox
as
it
was
being
killed
cry
out
ox
of
listen
to
us
this
is
your
ox
we
praise
you
by
all
your
names
and
tell
of
all
your
deeds
do
not
be
angry
with
us
any
more
do
you
not
see
that
this
is
your
ox
do
not
accuse
us
of
neglecting
you
when
forsooth
have
we
ceased
to
praise
you
and
offer
you
meat
and
beer
take
note
then
that
here
is
another
ox
we
are
offering
to
when
the
ox
is
dead
some
of
the
meat
is
mixed
with
herbs
and
medicines
and
placed
in
a
hut
with
a
bowlful
of
blood
this
meat
is
placed
in
the
part
of
the
hut
where
the
man
loved
to
sit
while
he
was
alive
and
some
one
is
told
off
to
guard
the
sacrifice
the
meat
is
left
for
a
night
or
longer
and
the
spirits
are
supposed
to
come
and
enjoy
the
smell
or
drink
the
serum
which
oozes
from
the
meat
and
to
inhale
the
smell
of
the
beer
the
priest
or
diviner
will
then
sprinkle
the
people
and
the
huts
with
medicine
made
from
the
contents
of
the
stomach
of
the
ox
he
places
a
little
on
a
sherd
when
this
is
dry
he
burns
it
and
calls
on
the
spirits
to
smell
the
incense
after
the
meat
has
been
left
for
a
certain
time
it
is
taken
out
and
cooked
and
eaten
by
the
men
near
the
cattle
kraal
in
public
if
the
trouble
does
not
vanish
after
this
ceremony
the
people
get
angry
and
say
to
the
spirits
when
have
we
ceased
to
kill
cattle
for
you
and
when
have
we
ever
refused
to
praise
you
by
your
why
then
do
you
treat
us
so
shabbily
if
you
do
not
behave
better
we
shall
utterly
forget
your
names
and
then
what
will
you
do
when
there
is
no
one
to
praise
you
you
will
have
to
go
and
live
on
grasshoppers
if
you
do
not
mend
your
ways
we
shall
forget
you
what
use
is
it
that
we
kill
oxen
for
you
and
praise
you
you
do
not
give
us
rain
or
crops
or
cause
our
cattle
to
bear
well
you
show
no
gratitude
in
return
for
all
we
do
for
you
we
shall
utterly
disown
you
we
shall
tell
the
people
that
as
for
us
we
have
no
ancestral
spirits
and
this
will
be
to
your
shame
we
are
disgusted
with
thus
the
sweet
savour
of
beef
and
beer
does
not
suffice
to
content
caffre
ghosts
they
share
the
love
of
praise
and
flattery
with
many
gods
of
higher
rank
among
the
basutos
an
important
bantu
people
of
south
africa
each
family
is
supposed
to
be
under
the
direct
influence
and
protection
of
its
ancestors
but
the
tribe
taken
as
a
whole
acknowledges
for
its
national
gods
the
ancestors
of
the
reigning
sovereign
thus
the
basutos
address
their
prayers
to
monaheng
and
motlumi
from
whom
their
chiefs
are
descended
the
baharutsis
and
the
barolongs
invoke
tobege
and
his
wife
mampa
mampa
makes
known
the
will
of
her
husband
announcing
each
of
her
revelations
by
these
words
re
o
re
he
has
said
he
has
said
they
make
a
distinction
between
the
ancient
and
modern
divinities
the
latter
are
considered
inferior
in
power
but
more
accessible
hence
this
formula
which
is
often
used
new
gods
entreat
the
ancient
gods
for
us
in
all
countries
spirits
are
more
the
objects
of
fear
than
of
love
a
deep
feeling
of
terror
generally
accompanies
the
idea
that
the
dead
dispose
of
the
lot
of
the
living
the
ancients
spoke
much
of
incensed
shades
if
they
sacrificed
to
the
manes
it
was
generally
in
order
to
appease
them
these
ideas
perfectly
correspond
to
those
of
the
basutos
they
conjure
rather
than
pray
although
they
seek
to
gain
favours
they
think
more
of
averting
chastisement
their
predominating
idea
as
to
their
ancestors
is
that
they
are
continually
endeavouring
to
draw
them
to
themselves
every
disease
is
attributed
to
them
thus
medicine
among
these
people
is
almost
entirely
a
religious
affair
the
first
thing
is
to
discover
by
means

will

he

gods
his

are

an

immolated
over

this

us
tranquil
similarly
among
the
thonga
another
bantu
tribe
of
south
africa
any
man
who
has
departed
this
earthly
life
becomes
a
a
god
when
an
old
decrepit
man
or
woman
dies
he
at
once
becomes
a
god
he
has
entered
the
domain
of
in
this
tribe
the
spirits
of
the
ancestors
are
the
main
objects
of
religious
worship
they
form
the
principal
category
of
on
the
one
hand
the
are
truly
gods
endowed
with
the
attributes
of
divinity
whilst
on
the
other
they
seem
to
be
nothing
but
mere
human
beings
exactly
on
the
same
level
as
their
there
are
two
great
classes
of
these
to
wit
those
of
the
family
and
those
of
the
country
the
latter
being
those
of
the
reigning
family
they
do
not
differ
as
regards
their
nature
in
national
calamities
those
of
the
country
are
invoked
whilst
for
purely
family
matters
those
of
the
family
are
called
upon
moreover
each
family
has
two
sets
of
gods
those
on
the
father
s
side
and
those
on
the
mother
s
those
of
and
those
of
they
are
equal
in
dignity
both
can
be
invoked
and
the
divinatory
bones
are
always
asked
to
which
the
offering
must
be
made
it
seems
however
as
if
the
gods
on
the
mother
s
side
were
more
and
more
popular
than
those
on
the
father
s
the
reason
for
this
is
perhaps
that
relations
are
easier
with
the
family
of
the
mother
than
with
that
of
the
father
it
is
also
just
possible
that
it
is
a
relic
of
the
matriarchal
period
when
the
ancestors
of
the
mother
only
were
known
and
consequently
invoked
at
any
rate
the
part
played
by
uterine
nephews
in
the
offerings
shows
that
they
are
the
true
representatives
of
the
gods
not
of
those
of
their
father
but
of
their
among
the
thonga
the
belief
in
the
continuation
of
life
after
death
is
universal
being
at
the
base
of
the
ancestrolatry
which
is
the
religion
of
the
how
real
is
the
ancestrolatry
the
religion
of
the
thonga
of
in
fact
all
the
south
african
bantus
how
frequent
and
manifold
are
its
manifestations
this
is
the
first
and
the
most
perceptible
set
of
their
religious
intuitions
and
any
european
who
has
stayed
in
their
villages
learnt
their
language
and
tried
to
understand
their
customs
has
had
the
opportunity
of
familiarizing
himself
with
this
among
the
basutos
and
bechuanas
who
also
belong
to
the
great
bantu
family
the
sacrificial
ritual
is
not
highly
developed
only
in
great
misfortunes
which
affect
the
whole
people
or
the
royal
family
a
black
ox
is
slaughtered
for
in
such
cases
they
always
think
that
the
angry
spirits
of
the

are
the
cause
of
all
the
suffering

its

eaten

the

and
the

are
poured

there
the
bones
of

animal
are
also

zulus
another
great
bantu
tribe
of
south
africa
believe
in
the
existence
of
a
being
whom
they
call
unkulunkulu
which
means
the
the
most
ancient
they
say
that
it
is
he
who
was
the
first
man
he
broke
off
in
the
beginning
we
do
not
know
his

the

do
not
tell
us
that
he
had
a

made
all
cattle
water

mountains
and
whatever
else
is

he
is
also
said
to

reed
when
the
first
man

other
things
issued
from

the
zulus
and
other
caffre
tribes
of
natal
believe
that
when
a
person
dies
his
or
survives
these
words
are
translated
spirit
and
there
seems
no
objection
to
the
rendering
they
refer
to
something
manifestly
distinguished
from
the
body
and
the
nature
of
which
the
prophets
endeavour
to
explain
by
saying
that
it
is
identical
with
the
shadow
the
residence
of
the
or
spirits
seems
to
be
beneath
the
practice
of
breaking
a
man
s
assagais
before
they
are
buried
with
him
shows
that
he
is
believed
to
return
to
earth
through
the
grave
while
it
appears
to
be
generally
thought
that
if
the
earth
were
removed
from
the
grave
the
ghost
would
return
and
frighten
his
descendants
when
spirits
have
entered
the
future
state
they
are
believed
to
possess
great
power
prosperity
is
ascribed
to
their
favour

misfortune
to
their
anger
they
are
elevated
in
fact
to
the
rank
of
deities
and
except
where
the
is
worshipped
concurrently
with
them
they
are
the
only
objects
of
a
kafir
s
adoration
their
attention
or
providence
is
limited
to
their
own
father
caring
for
the
family
and
a
chief
for
the
tribe
which
they
respectively
left
behind
them
they
are
believed
to
occupy
the
same
relative
position
as
they
did
in
the
body
the
departed
spirit
of
a
chief
being
sometimes
invoked
to
compel
a
man
s
ancestors
to
bless
to
these
shades
of
the
dead
especially
to
the
ghosts
of
their
great
men
as
jama
senzangakona
and
chaka
their
former
kings
they
look
for
help
and
offer
sacrifices
that
is
slaughter
cattle
to
them
and
offer
a
sort
of
prayer
in
time
of
danger
and
distress
when
they
are
sick
they
slaughter
cattle
to
the
shades
and
say
father
look
on
me
that
this
disease
may
cease
from
me
let
me
have
health
on
the
earth
and
live
a
long
they
carry
the
meat
into
the
house
and
shut
it
up
there
saying
let
the
paternal
shades
eat
so
shall
they
know
that
the
offering
was
made
for
them
and
grant
us
great
wealth
so
that
both
we
and
our
children
may
in
the
they
talk
a
long
time
praising
the
ghosts
they
take
the
contents
of
the
stomach
and
strew
it
upon
all
the
fold
again
they
take
it
and
strew
it
within
the
houses
saying
hail
friend
thou
of
such
a
place
grant
us
a
blessing
beholding
what
we
have
done
you
see
this
distress
may
you
remove
it
since
we
have
given
you
our
animal
we
know
not
what
more
you
want
whether
you
still
require
anything
more
or
they
say
may
you
grant
us
grain
that
it
may
be
abundant
that
we
may
eat
of
course
and
not
be
in
need
of
anything
since
now
we
have
given
you
what
you
they
say
yes
for
a
long
time
have
you
preserved
me
in
all
my
going
behold
you
see
i
have
just
come
to
have
a
kraal
this
kraal
was
built
by
yourself
father
and
now
why
do
you
consent
to
diminish
your
own
kraal
build
on
us
as
you
have
begun
let
it
be
large
that
your
offspring
still
here
above
may
increase
increasing
in
knowledge
of
you
whence
cometh
great
sometimes
they
make
beer
for
the
ghosts
and
leave
a
little
in
the
pot
saying
it
will
be
eaten
by
the
ghosts
that
they
may
grant
an
abundant
harvest
again
that
we
may
not
have
a
if
one
is
on
the
point
of
being
injured
by
anything
he
says
i
was
preserved
by
our
divinity
which
was
still
watching
over
perhaps
he
slaughters
a
goat
in
honour
of
the
same
and
puts
the
gall
on
his
head
and
when
the
goat
cries
out
for
pain
of
being
killed
he
says
yes
then
there
is
your
animal
let
it
cry
that
ye
may
hear
ye
our
gods
who
have
preserved
me
i
myself
am
desirous
of
living
on
thus
a
long
time
here
on
the
earth
why
then
do
you
call
me
to
account
since
i
think
i
am
all
right
in
respect
to
you
and
while
i
live
i
put
my
trust
in
you
our
paternal
and
maternal
black
people
say
the
zulus
do
not
worship
all
amatongo
indifferently
that
is
all
the
dead
of
their
tribe
speaking
generally
the
head
of
each
house
is
worshipped
by
the
children
of
that
house
for
they
do
not
know
the
ancients
who
are
dead
nor
their
names
nor
their
names
but
their
father
whom
they
knew
is
the
head
by
whom
they
begin
and
end
in
their
prayer
for
they
know
him
best
and
his
love
for
his
children
they
remember
his
kindness
to
them
whilst
he
was
living
they
compare
his
treatment
of
them
whilst
he
was
living
support
themselves
by
it
and
say
he
will
still
treat
us
in
the
same
way
now
he
is
dead
we
do
not
know
why
he
should
regard
others
besides
us
he
will
regard
us
so
it
is
then
although
they
worship
the
many
amatongo
of
their
tribe
making
a
great
fence
around
them
for
their
protection
yet
their
father
is
far
before
all
others
when
they
worship
the
amatongo
their
father
is
a
great
treasure
to
them
even
when
he
is
dead
and
those
of
his
children
who
are
already
grown
up
know
him
thoroughly
his
gentleness
and
his
bravery
and
if
there
is
illness
in
the
village
the
eldest
son
lauds
him
with
the
names
which
he
gained
when
fighting
with
the
enemy
and
at
the
same
time
lauds
all
the
other
amatongo
the
son
reproves
the
father
saying
we
for
our
parts
may
just
die
who
are
you
looking
after
let
us
die
all
of
us
that
we
may
see
into
whose
house
you
will
enter
you
will
eat
grasshoppers
you
will
no
longer
be
invited
to
go
anywhere
if
you
destroy
your
own
after
that
because
they
have
worshipped
him
they
take
courage
saying
he
has
heard
he
will
come
and
treat
our
diseases
and
they
will
such
then
is
the
faith
which
children
have
in
the
itongo
ancestral
spirit
which
is
their
father
and
if
there
is
a
chief
wife
of
a
village
who
has
given
birth
to
children
and
if
her
husband
is
not
dead
her
itongo
is
much
reverenced
by
her
husband
and
all
the
children
and
that
chief
wife
becomes
an
itongo
which
takes
great
care
of
the
village
but
it
is
the
father
especially
that
is
the
head
of
the
thus
among
the
zulus
it
is
the
spirits
of
those
who
have
just
died
especially
the
spirits
of
fathers
and
mothers
who
are
most
revered
and
worshipped
the
spirits
of
the
more
remote
dead
are
forgotten
when
the
missionaries
inquired
into
the
religious
ideas
of
the
herero
a
bantu
tribe
of
german
africa
they
heard
much
of
a
certain
mukuru
whom
at
first
they
took
to
be
the
great
god
of
heaven
and
earth
accordingly
they
adopted
mukuru
as
the
native
name
for
the
christian
god
and
set
out
on
their
mission
to
preach
the
glad
tidings
of
mukuru
and
his
divine
son
to
the
poor
benighted
heathen
but
their
first
experiences
were
disconcerting
again
and
again
when
they
arrived
in
a
village
and
announced
their
intention
to
the
chief
they
were
brought
up
very
short
by
that
great
man
who
told
them
with
an
air
of
astonishment
that
he
himself
was
mukuru
for
example
büttner
and
irle
paid
a
visit
to
an
old
chief
named
tjenda
and
remonstrated
with
him
on
the
impropriety
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
in
giving
a
baptized
girl
in
marriage
to
a
native
gentleman
whose
domestic
arrangements
were
framed
on
the
polygamous
patriarchal
pattern
mukuru
will
punish
you
for
that
said
büttner
what
roared
the
chief
who
s
mukuru
why
i
am
mukuru
in
my
own
tribe
and
he
bundled
the
two
missionaries
out
of
the
village
a
repetition
of
these
painful
incidents
at
last
impressed
on
the
minds
of
the
missionaries
the
conviction
that
mukuru
was
not
god
at
all
but
merely
the
head
of
a
family
an
ancestor
whether
alive
or
dead
they
ascertained
at
the
same
time
that
the
herero
recognize
a
good
god
who
dwells
in
heaven
and
bears
the
name
of
ndjambi
karunga
but
they
do
not
worship
him
nor
bring
him
offerings
because
he
is
so
kind
that
he
hurts
nobody
and
therefore
they
need
not
fear
him
rather
they
share
the
opinion
of
the
other
bantu
tribes
that
ndjambi
the
good
creator
has
withdrawn
to
heaven
and
left
the
government
on
earth
to
the
it
is
true
that
the
herero
are
acquainted
with
punishment
for
what
is
bad
but
that
punishment
they
ascribe
to
mukuru
or
their
ancestors
it
is
their
ancestors
whom
they
must
fear
it
is
they
who
are
angry
and
can
bring
danger
and
misfortune
on
a
man
so
it
is
intelligible
that
the
whole
of
their
worship
turns
not
on
ndjambi
karunga
but
on
their
ancestors
it
is
in
order
to
win
and
keep
their
favour
to
avert
their
displeasure
and
wrath
in
short
to
propitiate
them
that
the
herero
bring
their
many
offerings
they
do
so
not
out
of
gratitude
but
out
of
fear
not
out
of
love
but
out
of
terror
their
religion
is
a
worship
of
ancestors
with
here
and
there
touches
of
thus
among
the
herero
as
among
all
bantu
tribes
there
exists
a
religious
dualism
they
know
the
highest
the
true
god
but
they
worship
their
and
among
the
worshipful
ancestors
the
old
dead
chiefs
of
every
tribe
take
the
first
place
the
son
of
a
great
dead
chief
and
the
whole
tribe
worship
that
old
father
as
their
god
but
the
remote
ancestors
of
that
chief
they
do
not
worship
indeed
they
hardly
know
them
by
name
and
can
no
longer
point
to
their
thus
with
the
herero
as
with
the
zulus
it
is
the
recent
and
dead
who
are
chiefly
or
exclusively
worshipped
as
the
souls
of
the
departed
recede
further
and
further
into
the
past
their
memory
perishes
and
the
nimbus
of
supernatural
glory
which
encircled
it
for
a
time
fades
gradually
away
the
religion
of
the
ovambo
another
bantu
tribe
of
german
africa
is
similar
they
also
recognize
a
great
being
named
kalunga
who
created
the
world
and
man
but
they
neither
fear
nor
worship
him
a
far
greater
part
is
played
in
the
religion
of
the
ovambo
by
their
belief
in
spirits
and
amongst
the
worshipful
spirits
a
conspicuous
place
is
assigned
to
the
souls
of
the
dead
every
man
leaves
behind
him
at
death
a
spirit
which
continues
to
exist
on
earth
and
can
influence
the
living
for
example
it
may
enter
into
their
bodies
and
thereby
cause
all
sorts
of
sickness
however
the
souls
of
ordinary
dead
men
can
exert
their
influence
only
on
members
of
their
own
families
the
souls
of
dead
chiefs
on
the
other
hand
have
power
over
the
rain
which
they
can
either
give
or
withhold
to
these
powerful
spirits
a
portion
of
the
new
corn
is
offered
at
harvest
as
a
for
their
forbearance
in
not
visiting
the
people
with
sickness
and
above
all
for
their
bounty
in
sending
down
the
fertilizing
showers
on
the
crops
the
souls
of
dead
magicians
are
particularly
dreaded
and
to
prevent
the
multiplication
of
these
dangerous
spirits
it
is
customary
to
dismember
their
bodies
severing
the
arms
and
legs
from
the
trunk
and
cutting
the
tongue
out
of
the
mouth
if
these
precautions
are
taken
immediately
after
death
the
soul
of
the
dead
man
can
not
become
a
dangerous
ghost
the
mutilation
of
his
body
has
practically
disarmed
his
spirit
the
wahehe
a
bantu
tribe
of
german
east
africa
believe
in
a
great
invisible
spirit
named
nguruhi
who
created
the
world
and
rules
both
human
destiny
and
the
elements
he
it
is
who
makes
the
rain
to
fall
the
sun
to
shine
the
wind
to
blow
the
thunder
to
roll
and
the
crops
to
grow
this
god
is
accordingly
conceived
as
yet
with
the
limitation
that
he
only
exercises
a
general
power
of
direction
over
the
world
especially
human
fate
while
the
the
spirits
of
the
dead
wield
a
permanent
and
very
considerable
influence
on
the
course
of
particular
events
nguruhi
is
lord
also
of
all
the
spirits
of
the
dead
but
his
relation
to
them
has
not
been
further
thought
out
with
this
supreme
being
the
people
hold
no
intercourse
by
means
of
prayer
sacrifice
or
in
any
other
way
he
stands
remote
from
the
religious
life
of
the
wahehe
and
really
serves
only
as
an
explanation
of
all
those
things
and
events
which
are
otherwise
inexplicable
all
religious
intercourse
all
worship
centres
alone
on
the
spirits
of
the
dead
hence
if
we
speak
of
a
religion
of
the
wahehe
it
must
be
described
as
a
pure
worship
of
the
human
soul
quits
the
body
at
death
and
at
once
becomes
an
ancestral
spirit
invisible
and
endowed
with
complete
liberty
of
motion
even
the
youngest
children
have
souls
which
rank
among
the
ancestral
spirits
at
death
hence
the
great
multitude
of
the
dead
comprises
spirits
of
all
ages
from
the
infant
one
day
old
to
the
patriarch
they
are
good
or
bad
according
as
they
were
good
or
bad
in
life
and
their
social
position
also
is
unchanged
he
who
was
powerful
in
life
is
powerful
also
in
death
he
who
was
a
nobody
among
men
is
a
nobody
also
among
the
spirits
hence
the
ghost
of
a
great
man
can
do
more
for
the
living
than
the
ghost
of
a
common
man
and
the
ghost
of
a
man
can
do
more
than
the
ghost
of
a
woman
yet
even
the
meanest
ghost
has
power
over
the
greatest
living
man
who
can
only
defend
himself
by
appealing
for
help
to
stronger
ancestral
spirits
thus
while
the
supreme
being
exercises
a
general
superintendence
over
affairs
the
real
administration
is
in
the
hands
of
the
ancestral
spirits
while
he
for
example
regulates
the
weather
as
a
whole
it
is
the
ghosts
who
cause
each
particular
shower
to
fall
or
the
sun
to
break
out
in
glory
from
the
clouds
if
he
sends
plagues
on
the
whole
people
or
stays
the
ravages
of
disease
it
is
the
ghosts
who
make
each
individual
sick
or
sound
these
powerful
spirits
exert
themselves
especially
to
help
their
descendants
though
they
do
not
hesitate
to
plague
their
own
kith
and
kin
if
they
think
themselves
neglected
they
flit
freely
through
the
air
and
perch
on
trees
mountains
and
so
forth
but
they
lodge
by
preference
at
their
graves
and
you
are
always
sure
of
finding
them
there
if
you
wish
to
consult
them
that
is
why
in
the
country
of
the
wahehe
the
only
places
of
sacrifice
are
the
graves
temples
and
altars
are
unknown
however
it
is
only
the
bodies
of
considerable
persons
that
are
buried
the
corpses
of
common
folk
are
simply
thrown
away
in
the
bush
so
that
the
number
of
graves
and
consequently
of
sacrificial
places
is
strictly
limited
the
spirits
of
the
dead
appear
to
the
living
most
commonly
in
dreams
to
give
them
information
or
warning
but
oftener
to
chide
and
torment
them
so
the
sleeper
wakes
in
a
fright
and
consults
a
diviner
who
directs
him
what
he
must
do
in
order
to
appease
the
angry
ghost
following
the
directions
of
his
spiritual
adviser
the
man
sacrifices
an
ox
or
it
may
be
only
a
sheep
or
a
fowl
at
the
tomb
of
one
of
his
ancestors
prays
to
the
ghost
and
having
scattered
a
few
morsels
of
the
victim
s
flesh
on
the
grave
and
spat
a
mouthful
of
beer
upon
it
retires
with
his
family
to
feast
on
the
remainder
of
the
carcase
such
sacrifices
to
the
dead
are
offered
on
occasion
of
sickness
the
lack
of
male
heirs
a
threatened
war
an
intended
journey
in
short
before
any
important
undertaking
of
which
the
issue
is
doubtful
and
they
are
accompanied
by
prayers
for
health
victory
good
harvests
and
so
forth
once
more
the
bahima
a
bantu
people
of
ankole
in
central
africa
believe
in
a
supreme
god
lugaba
who
dwells
in
the
sky
and
created
man
and
beast
but
this
supreme
being
is
not
worshipped
nor
are
offerings
made
to
him
he
has
no
sacred
place
although
they
talk
freely
about
him
and
acknowledge
him
to
be
their
great
benefactor
they
accept
all
his
gifts
as
a
matter
of
course
and
make
him
no
offering
in
return
one
must
not
therefore
conclude
that
the
bahima
are
an
irreligious
people
like
most
of
the
bantu
tribes
their
religion
consists
chiefly
in
dealing
with
ghosts
of
departed
relatives
and
in
standing
well
with
them
from
the
king
to
the
humblest
peasant
the
ghosts
call
for
daily
consideration
and
constant
offerings
whilst
the
deities
are
only
sought
in
case
of
great
trials
or
national
to
return
now
to
the
worship
of
dead
chiefs
or
kings
among
the
bantu
tribes
of
northern
rhodesia
the
spirits
of
dead
chiefs
had
priestesses
to
wait
upon
them
who
were
called
the
wives
of
the
these
were
elderly
women
who
led
a
celibate
life
and
swept
the
huts
dedicated
to
the
ghosts
of
the
chiefs
the
aid
of
these
dead
potentates
was
invoked
in
time
of
war
and
in
seasons
of
drought
and
special
offerings
were
brought
to
their
shrines
at
harvest
among
the
awemba
who
form
the
aristocracy
of
the
country
when
a
diviner
announced
that
a
drought
was
caused
by
the
spirits
of
dead
chiefs
or
kings
buried
at
mwaruli
a
bull
would
be
sent
to
be
sacrificed
to
the
souls
of
the
deceased
rulers
or
if
the
drought
was
severe
a
human
victim
would
be
despatched
and
the
high
priest
would
keep
him
caged
in
a
stoutly
woven
until
the
preparations
for
the
sacrifice
were
complete
among
the
yombe
no
one
might
eat
of
the
of
the
crops
until
the
living
chief
had
sacrificed
a
bull
before
the
tomb
of
his
grandfather
and
had
deposited
pots
of
fresh
beer
and
porridge
made
from
the
in
front
of
the
shrine
the
ground
about
the
tomb
was
then
carefully
weeded
and
the
blood
of
the
sacrificial
victim
sprinkled
on
the
freshly
turned
up
soil
and
on
the
rafters
of
the
little
hut
after
thanking
the
ghost
of
his
grandfather
for
the
harvest
and
begging
him
to
partake
of
the
the
chief
and
his
train
withdrew
to
feast
on
the
carcase
and
the
fresh
porridge
and
beer
at
the
village
when
the
head
chief
or
king
of
the
awemba
had
resolved
to
make
war
on
a
distant
enemy
he
and
the
older
men
of
the
tribe
would
pray
daily
for
victory
to
the
spirits
of
the
dead
kings
his
predecessors
the
day
before
the
army
was
to
set
forth
the
great
boomed
out
and
the
warriors
flocked
together
from
the
outlying
districts
under
their
respective
captains
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
the
king
and
the
elderly
women
who
passed
for
the
wives
of
the
dead
kings
and
tended
their
shrines
at
the
capital
went
and
prayed
at
these
shrines
that
the
souls
of
the
departed
monarchs
would
keep
the
free
from
foes
and
lead
the
king
in
a
straight
course
to
the
enemy
s
stockade
these
solemn
prayers
the
king
led
in
person
and
the
women
beat
their
bare
breasts
as
they
joined
in
the
earnest
appeal
next
morning
the
whole
army
was
marshalled
in
front
of
the
of
the
dead
kings
the
living
king
danced
a
before
his
ancestors
while
his
chief
wife
sprinkled
him
with
holy
flour
and
all
prostrated
themselves
in
supplication
before
the
shrines
among
these
tribes
of
northern
rhodesia
the
spirits
of
dead
chiefs
or
kings
sometimes
take
possession
of
the
bodies
of
live
men
or
women
and
prophesy
through
their
mouths
when
the
spirit
of
a
dead
chief
comes
over
a
man
he
begins
to
roar
like
a
lion
whereupon
the
women
gather
together
and
beat
the
drums
shouting
that
the
chief
has
come
to
visit
the
village
the
man
thus
temporarily
inspired
will
prophesy
of
future
wars
or
impending
attacks
by
lions
while
the
inspiration
lasts
he
may
eat
nothing
cooked
by
fire
but
only
unfermented
dough
however
the
spirit
of
a
departed
chief
takes
possession
of
women
oftener
than
of
men
these
women
assert
that
they
are
possessed
by
the
soul
of
some
dead
chief
and
when
they
feel
the
divine
afflatus
whiten
their
faces
to
attract
attention
and
anoint
themselves
with
flour
which
has
a
religious
and
sanctifying
potency
one
of
their
number
beats
a
drum
and
the
others
dance
singing
at
the
same
time
a
weird
song
with
curious
intervals
finally
when
they
have
arrived
at
the
requisite
pitch
of
religious
exaltation
the
possessed
woman
falls
to
the
ground
and
bursts
forth
into
a
low
and
almost
inarticulate
chant
which
has
a
most
uncanny
effect
all
are
silent
at
once
and
the
gather
round
to
interpret
the
voice
of
the
sometimes
the
spirits
of
departed
chiefs
are
reincarnated
in
animals
which
are
then
revered
as
the
abodes
of
the
dead
rulers
thus
the
paramount
chief
of
the
amambwe
is
incarnated
after
death
in
the
form
of
a
young
lion
while
bisa
and
wiwa
chiefs
come
back
in
the
shape
of
pythons
in
one
of
the
near
fife
a
tame
python
waxed
fat
on
the
offerings
of
fowls
and
sour
beer
which
the
winamwanga
presented
to
it
in
the
fond
belief
that
it
housed
the
spirit
of
one
of
their
dead
chiefs
one
day
unfortunately
for
himself
the
reptile
deity
ventured
to
dispute
the
possession
of
the
with
a
german
who
was
passing
by
a
discharge
of
shot
settled
the
dispute
in
favour
of
the
and
the
worshippers
of
the
deity
beheld
him
no
more
another
bantu
people
who
worship
the
spirits
of
their
dead
kings
are
the
barotse
or
marotse
of
the
upper
zambesi
the
barotse
believe
in
a
supreme
god
the
creator
of
all
things
whom
they
call
niambe
he
lives
in
the
sun
and
by
his
marriage
with
the
moon
begat
the
world
the
animals
and
last
of
all
men
but
the
cunning
and
ferocity
of
his
creature
man
terrified
the
beneficent
creator
so
that
he
fled
from
earth
and
escaped
up
the
thread
of
a
spider
s
web
to
heaven
there
he
still
retains
a
certain
power
to
interfere
in
human
affairs
and
that
is
why
men
sometimes
pray
and
sacrifice
to
him
for
example
the
worshipper
salutes
the
rising
sun
and
offers
him
a
vessel
of
water
no
doubt
to
quench
the
thirst
of
the
deity
on
his
hot
journey
across
the
sky
again
when
a
long
drought
has
prevailed
a
black
ox
is
sacrificed
to
niambe
as
a
symbol
of
the
clouds
big
with
the
and
before
they
sow
the
fields
the
women
pile
the
seeds
and
their
digging
hoes
in
a
heap
and
pray
to
the
god
that
he
would
render
their
labour
fruitful
yet
while
they
acknowledge
the
divine
supremacy
of
niambe
the
barotse
address
their
prayers
most
frequently
to
the
inferior
deities
the
who
are
the
deified
kings
of
the
country
the
tombs
of
the
departed
monarchs
may
be
seen
near
the
villages
which
they
inhabited
in
life
each
tomb
stands
in
a
grove
of
beautiful
trees
and
is
encircled
by
a
tall
palisade
of
pointed
stakes
covered
with
fine
mats
like
the
palisade
which
surrounds
the
royal
residence
of
a
living
king
such
an
enclosure
is
sacred
the
people
are
forbidden
to
enter
it
lest
they
should
disturb
the
ghost
of
him
who
sleeps
below
but
the
inhabitants
of
the
nearest
village
are
charged
with
the
duty
of
keeping
the
tomb
and
the
enclosure
in
good
order
repairing
the
palisade
and
replacing
the
mats
when
they
are
worn
out
once
a
month
at
the
new
moon
the
women
sweep
not
only
the
grave
and
the
enclosure
but
the
whole
village
the
guardian
of
the
tomb
is
at
the
same
time
a
priest
he
acts
as
intermediary
between
the
god
and
the
people
who
come
to
pray
to
the
deity
he
bears
the
title
of
ngomboti
he
alone
has
the
right
to
enter
the
sacred
enclosure
the
profane
multitude
must
stand
at
a
respectful
distance
even
the
king
himself
when
he
comes
to
consult
one
of
his
ancestors
is
forbidden
to
set
foot
on
the
holy
ground
in
presence
of
the
god
or
as
they
call
him
the
master
of
the
tomb
the
monarch
must
bear
himself
like
a
slave
in
the
presence
of
his
lord
he
kneels
down
near
the
entrance
claps
his
hands
and
gives
the
royal
salute
and
from
within
the
enclosure
the
priest
solemnly
returns
the
salute
just
as
the
king
himself
when
he
holds
his
court
returns
the
salute
of
his
subjects
then
the
suppliant
whether
king
or
commoner
makes
his
petition
to
the
deity
and
deposits
his
offering
for
no
man
may
pray
to
the
god
with
empty
hands
inside
the
enclosure
close
to
the
entrance
is
a
hole
which
is
supposed
to
serve
as
a
channel
of
communication
with
the
spirit
of
the
deified
king
in
it
the
offerings
are
placed
often
they
consist
of
milk
which
is
poured
into
the
hole
and
the
faster
it
drains
away
the
more
favourably
inclined
is
the
god
thought
to
be
to
the
petitioner
more
solid
offerings
such
as
flesh
clothes
and
glass
beads
become
the
property
of
the
priest
after
they
have
been
allowed
to
lie
for
a
decent
time
beside
the
sacred
aperture
of
the
tomb
the
spirits
of
dead
kings
are
thus
consulted
on
matters
of
public
concern
as
well
as
by
private
individuals
touching
their
own
affairs
if
a
war
is
to
be
waged
if
a
plague
is
raging
among
the
people
or
a
murrain
among
the
cattle
if
the
land
is
parched
with
drought
in
short
if
any
danger
threatens
or
any
calamity
has
afflicted
the
country
recourse
is
had
to
these
local
gods
dwelling
each
in
his
shady
grove
not
far
from
the
abodes
of
the
living
they
are
near
but
the
great
god
in
heaven
is
far
away
what
wonder
therefore
that
their
help
is
often
sought
while
he
is
neglected
they
are
national
heroes
as
well
as
gods
their
history
is
remembered
men
tell
of
the
doughty
deeds
they
did
in
their
lifetime
why
should
they
not
be
able
to
succour
their
votaries
now
that
they
have
put
on
immortality
all
over
the
country
these
may
be
seen
they
serve
as
historical
monuments
to
recall
to
the
people
the
names
of
their
former
kings
and
the
annals
of
their
country
one
of
the
most
popular
of
the
royal
shrines
is
near
senanga
at
the
southern
end
of
the
great
plain
of
the
barotse
voyagers
who
go
down
the
zambesi
do
not
fail
to
pay
their
devotions
at
the
shrine
that
the
god
of
the
place
may
make
their
voyage
to
prosper
and
may
guard
the
frail
canoe
from
shipwreck
in
the
rush
and
roar
of
the
rapids
and
when
they
return
in
safety
they
repair
again
to
the
sacred
spot
to
deposit
a
for
the
protection
of
the
deity
the
foregoing
examples
suffice
to
prove
that
the
worship
of
dead
chiefs
and
kings
has
been
an
important
perhaps
we
may
even
say
the
most
important
element
in
the
religion
of
many
african
tribes
regarded
from
the
native
point
of
view
nothing
could
be
more
natural
the
king
rules
over
his
people
in
life
and
since
all
these
tribes
entertain
a
firm
and
unquestioning
belief
not
only
in
the
existence
but
in
the
power
of
the
spirits
of
the
dead
they
necessarily
conclude
that
of
all
the
departed
spirits
none
can
be
so
potent
for
good
or
evil
none
therefore
need
to
be
propitiated
so
earnestly
by
prayer
and
sacrifice
as
the
souls
of
dead
kings
thus
while
every
family
worships
privately
the
spirits
of
its
own
ancestors
the
whole
tribe
worships
publicly
the
spirits
of
its
departed
monarchs
paying
to
each
of
these
invisible
potentates
whose
reality
they
never
dream
of
doubting
a
homage
of
precisely
the
same
sort
as
that
which
they
render
to
his
living
successor
on
the
throne
such
a
religion
of
the
dead
is
by
no
means
incompatible
with
the
recognition
of
higher
spiritual
powers
who
may
have
an
origin
quite
independent
of
the
worship
of
ancestors
we
have
seen
in
point
of
fact
that
many
tribes
whose
practical
religion
is
concentrated
chiefly
on
their
dead
nevertheless
acknowledge
the
existence
of
a
supreme
god
the
creator
of
man
and
of
all
things
whom
they
do
not
regard
as
a
glorified
ghost
the
baganda
the
most
progressive
and
advanced
of
all
the
bantu
tribes
had
a
whole
pantheon
of
gods
whom
they
sharply
distinguished
from
the
worshipful
spirits
of
their
forefathers
yet
in
spite
of
this
distinction
we
may
suspect
that
in
many
cases
the
seeming
line
of
division
between
gods
and
worshipful
ghosts
is
deceptive
and
that
the
magic
touch
of
time
which
distorts
and
magnifies
the
past
especially
among
peoples
who
see
it
only
through
the
haze
of
oral
tradition
has
glorified
and
transfigured
many
a
dead
man
into
a
deity
this
at
all
events
seems
to
have
been
the
history
of
some
of
the
baganda
gods
on
this
subject
our
best
authority
says
that
the
principal
gods
appear
to
have
been
at
one
time
human
beings
noted
for
their
skill
and
bravery
who
were
afterwards
deified
by
the
people
and
invested
with
supernatural
mukasa
held
the
highest
rank
among
the
gods
of
uganda
he
was
a
benign
god
he
never
asked
for
the
life
of
any
human
being
but
animals
were
sacrificed
to
him
at
the
yearly
festivals
and
also
at
other
times
when
the
king
or
a
leading
chief
wished
to
consult
him
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
war
but
sought
to
heal
the
bodies
and
minds
of
men
he
was
the
god
of
plenty
he
gave
the
people
an
increase
of
food
cattle
and
children
from
the
legends
still
current
it
seems
to
be
almost
certain
that
he
was
a
human
being
who
because
of
his
benevolence
came
to
be
regarded
as
a
god
the
legends
about
mukasa
are
of
great
interest
they
show
how
the
human
element
has
been
lost
in
the
divine
how
the
natural
has
been
effaced
by
the
supernatural
until
in
the
minds
of
the
common
people
only
the
supernatural
if
we
can
not
prove
that
the
great
god
mukasa
himself
was
once
a
man
we
have
very
tangible
evidence
that
his
brother
the
kibuka
was
so
for
like
the
dead
kings
of
uganda
kibuka
was
worshipped
in
a
great
conical
hut
resembling
the
huts
which
living
people
inhabit
like
them
his
spirit
was
supposed
to
enter
from
time
to
time
into
the
body
of
his
priest
and
to
give
oracles
through
him
and
like
them
he
was
represented
in
his
temple
by
his
personal
relics
his
jawbone
and
his
which
were
rescued
from
the
ruins
of
his
temple
and
now
rest
in
the
ethnological
museum
at
cambridge
in
face
of
this
complete
parallelism
between
the
god
and
the
kings
whose
personal
existence
is
not
open
to
question
it
seems
difficult
to
doubt
that
kibuka
was
once
like
them
a
real
man
and
that
he
spoke
with
the
jawbone
and
made
bodily
use
of
the
other
corporeal
organs
which
were
preserved
in
his
temple
these
analogies
lend
some
support
to
the
theory
that
in
ancient
egypt
where
the
kings
were
worshipped
by
their
people
both
in
life
and
death
osiris
may
have
been
originally
nothing
but
one
of
these
deified
monarchs
whose
worship
gradually
eclipsed
that
of
all
the
rest
and
ended
by
rivalling
or
even
surpassing
that
of
the
great
himself
we
have
seen
that
at
abydos
one
of
the
principal
centres
of
his
worship
the
tomb
of
osiris
was
identified
with
the
tomb
of
king
khent
one
of
the
earliest
monarchs
of
the
first
egyptian
dynasty
and
that
in
this
tomb
were
found
a
woman
s
richly
jewelled
arm
and
a
human
skull
lacking
the
lower
jawbone
which
may
well
be
the
head
of
the
king
himself
and
the
arm
of
his
queen
the
carved
monument
of
osiris
which
was
found
in
the
sepulchral
chamber
appears
indeed
to
be
a
work
of
late
egyptian
art
but
it
may
have
replaced
an
earlier
sarcophagus
certainly
we
may
reasonably
suppose
that
the
identification
of
the
tomb
of
osiris
with
the
tomb
of
king
khent
was
very
ancient
for
though
the
priests
may
have
renewed
the
sculptured
effigy
of
the
dead
god
they
would
hardly
dare
to
shift
the
site
of
the
holy
sepulchre
now
the
sepulchre
is
distant
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
temple
in
which
osiris
was
worshipped
as
a
god
there
is
thus
a
curious
coincidence
if
there
is
nothing
more
between
the
worship
of
osiris
and
the
worship
of
the
dead
kings
of
uganda
as
a
dead
king
of
uganda
was
worshipped
in
a
temple
while
his
headless
body
reposed
at
some
distance
in
a
royal
tomb
and
his
head
without
the
lower
jawbone
was
buried
by
itself
near
the
grave
so
osiris
was
worshipped
in
a
temple
not
far
from
the
royal
tomb
which
tradition
identified
with
his
grave
perhaps
after
all
tradition
was
right
it
is
possible
though
it
would
be
very
rash
to
affirm
that
osiris
was
no
other
than
the
historical
king
khent
of
the
first
dynasty
that
the
skull
found
in
the
tomb
is
the
skull
of
osiris
himself
and
that
while
it
reposed
in
the
grave
the
missing
jawbone
was
preserved
like
the
jawbone
of
a
dead
king
of
uganda
as
a
holy
and
perhaps
oracular
relic
in
the
neighbouring
temple
if
that
were
so
we
should
be
almost
driven
to
conclude
that
the
bejewelled
woman
s
arm
found
in
the
tomb
of
osiris
is
the
arm
of
isis
in
support
of
the
conclusion
that
the
myth
and
religion
of
osiris
grew
up
round
the
revered
memory
of
a
dead
man
we
may
quote
the
words
in
which
the
historian
of
european
morals
describes
the
necessity
under
which
the
popular
imagination
labours
of
embodying
its
cherished
ideals
in
living
persons
he
is
referring
to
the
dawn
of
the
age
of
chivalry
when
in
the
morning
twilight
the
heroic
figure
of
charlemagne
rose
like
a
bright
star
above
the
political
horizon
to
be
thenceforth
encircled
by
a
halo
of
romance
like
the
nimbus
that
shone
round
the
head
of
osiris
in
order
that
the
tendencies
i
have
described
should
acquire
their
full
force
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
be
represented
or
illustrated
in
some
great
personage
who
by
the
splendour
and
the
beauty
of
his
career
could
fascinate
the
imaginations
of
men
it
is
much
easier
to
govern
great
masses
of
men
through
their
imagination
than
through
their
reason
moral
principles
rarely
act
powerfully
upon
the
world
except
by
way
of
example
or
ideals
when
the
course
of
events
has
been
to
glorify
the
ascetic
or
monarchical
or
military
spirit
a
great
saint
or
sovereign
or
soldier
will
arise
who
will
concentrate
in
one
dazzling
focus
the
blind
tendencies
of
his
time
kindle
the
enthusiasm
and
fascinate
the
imagination
of
the
people
but
for
the
prevailing
tendency
the
great
man
would
not
have
arisen
or
would
not
have
exercised
his
great
influence
but
for
the
great
man
whose
career
appealed
vividly
to
the
imagination
the
prevailing
tendency
would
never
have
acquired
its
full
whether
the
parallel
thus
suggested
between
charlemagne
the
mediaeval
ideal
of
a
christian
knight
and
osiris
the
ancient
egyptian
ideal
of
a
just
and
beneficent
monarch
holds
good
or
not
it
is
now
impossible
to
determine
for
while
charlemagne
stands
near
enough
to
allow
us
clearly
to
discern
his
historical
reality
osiris
is
so
remote
that
we
can
no
longer
discriminate
with
any
certitude
between
the
elements
of
history
and
fable
which
appear
to
have
blended
in
his
traditional
character
i
am
content
to
indicate
bare
possibilities
dogmatism
on
such
points
would
be
in
the
highest
degree
rash
and
unbecoming
whether
osiris
and
isis
were
from
first
to
last
purely
imaginary
beings
the
ideal
creations
of
a
primitive
philosophy
or
whether
they
were
originally
a
real
man
and
woman
about
whom
after
death
the
fancy
wove
its
gossamer
web
is
a
question
to
which
i
am
not
bold
enough
to
give
a
decided
answer
chapter
xii
and
mother
goddesses
dying
gods
and
mourning
goddesses
we
have
now
concluded
our
inquiry
into
the
nature
and
worship
of
the
three
oriental
deities
adonis
attis
and
osiris
the
substantial
similarity
of
their
mythical
character
justifies
us
in
treating
of
them
together
all
three
apparently
embodied
the
powers
of
fertility
in
general
and
of
vegetation
in
particular
all
three
were
believed
to
have
died
and
risen
again
from
the
dead
and
the
divine
death
and
resurrection
of
all
three
were
dramatically
represented
at
annual
festivals
which
their
worshippers
celebrated
with
alternate
transports
of
sorrow
and
joy
of
weeping
and
exultation
the
natural
phenomena
thus
mythically
conceived
and
mythically
represented
were
the
great
changes
of
the
seasons
especially
the
most
striking
and
impressive
of
all
the
decay
and
revival
of
vegetation
and
the
intention
of
the
sacred
dramas
was
to
refresh
and
strengthen
by
sympathetic
magic
the
failing
energies
of
nature
in
order
that
the
trees
should
bear
fruit
that
the
corn
should
ripen
that
men
and
animals
should
reproduce
their
kinds
but
the
three
gods
did
not
stand
by
themselves
the
mythical
personification
of
nature
of
which
all
three
were
in
at
least
one
aspect
the
products
required
that
each
of
them
should
be
coupled
with
a
goddess
and
in
each
case
it
appears
that
originally
the
goddess
was
a
more
powerful
and
important
personage
than
the
god
at
all
events
it
is
always
the
god
rather
than
the
goddess
who
comes
to
a
sad
end
and
whose
death
is
annually
mourned
thus
whereas
osiris
was
slain
by
typhon
his
divine
spouse
isis
survived
and
brought
him
to
life
again
this
feature
of
the
myth
seems
to
indicate
that
in
the
beginning
isis
was
what
astarte
and
cybele
always
continued
to
be
the
stronger
divinity
of
the
pair
now
the
superiority
thus
assigned
to
the
goddess
over
the
god
is
most
naturally
explained
as
the
result
of
a
social
system
in
which
maternity
counted
for
more
than
paternity
descent
being
traced
and
property
handed
down
through
women
rather
than
through
men
at
all
events
this
explanation
can
not
be
deemed
intrinsically
improbable
if
we
can
show
that
the
supposed
cause
has
produced
the
very
same
effect
among
existing
peoples
about
whose
institutions
we
possess
accurate
information
this
i
will
now
endeavour
to
do
influence
of
on
religion
the
social
system
which
traces
descent
and
transmits
property
through
the
mother
alone
may
be
called
while
the
converse
system
which
traces
descent
and
transmits
property
through
the
father
alone
may
be
called
a
good
example
of
the
influence
which
may
exert
on
religion
is
furnished
by
the
khasis
of
assam
whose
customs
and
beliefs
have
lately
been
carefully
recorded
by
a
british
officer
specially
charged
with
the
study
of
the
native
races
of
the
province
like
the
ancient
egyptians
and
the
semites
of
syria
and
mesopotamia
the
khasis
live
in
settled
villages
and
maintain
themselves
chiefly
by
the
cultivation
of
the
ground
yet
their
social
organization
presents
one
of
the
most
perfect
examples
still
surviving
of
matriarchal
institutions
carried
out
with
a
logic
and
thoroughness
which
to
those
accustomed
to
regard
the
status
and
authority
of
the
father
as
the
foundation
of
society
are
exceedingly
remarkable
not
only
is
the
mother
the
head
and
source
and
only
bond
of
union
of
the
family
in
the
most
primitive
part
of
the
hills
the
synteng
country
she
is
the
only
owner
of
real
property
and
through
her
alone
is
inheritance
transmitted
the
father
has
no
kinship
with
his
children
who
belong
to
their
mother
s
clan
what
he
earns
goes
to
his
own
matriarchal
stock
and
at
his
death
his
bones
are
deposited
in
the
cromlech
of
his
mother
s
kin
in
jowai
he
neither
lives
nor
eats
in
his
wife
s
house
but
visits
it
only
after
dark
in
the
veneration
of
ancestors
which
is
the
foundation
of
the
tribal
piety
the
primal
ancestress
and
her
brother
are
the
only
persons
regarded
the
flat
memorial
stones
set
up
to
perpetuate
the
memory
of
the
dead
are
called
after
the
woman
who
represents
the
clan
and
the
standing
stones
ranged
behind
them
are
dedicated
to
the
male
kinsmen
on
the
mother
s
side
in
harmony
with
this
scheme
of
ancestor
worship
the
other
spirits
to
whom
propitiation
is
offered
are
mainly
female
though
here
male
personages
also
figure
the
powers
of
sickness
and
death
are
all
female
and
these
are
those
most
frequently
worshipped
the
two
protectors
of
the
household
are
goddesses
though
with
them
is
also
revered
the
first
father
of
the
clan
priestesses
assist
at
all
sacrifices
and
the
male
officiants
are
only
their
deputies
in
one
important
state
khyrim
the
high
priestess
and
actual
head
of
the
state
is
a
woman
who
combines
in
her
person
sacerdotal
and
regal
thus
amongst
the
khasis
of
the
present
day
the
superiority
of
the
goddess
to
the
god
and
especially
of
the
revered
ancestress
to
the
revered
ancestor
is
based
directly
on
the
social
system
which
traces
descent
and
transmits
property
through
women
only
it
is
not
unreasonable
therefore
to
suppose
that
in
western
asia
the
superiority
of
the
mother
goddess
to
the
father
god
originated
in
the
same
archaic
system
of
another
instance
of
the
same
cause
producing
the
same
effect
may
be
drawn
from
the
institutions
of
the
pelew
islanders
which
have
been
described
by
an
accurate
observer
long
resident
in
the
islands
these
people
who
form
a
branch
of
the
micronesian
stock
are
divided
into
a
series
of
exogamous
families
or
clans
with
descent
in
the
female
line
so
that
as
usually
happens
under
such
a
system
a
man
s
heirs
are
not
his
own
children
but
the
children
of
his
sister
or
of
his
maternal
aunt
every
family
or
clan
traces
its
descent
from
a
woman
the
common
mother
of
the
whole
kin
and
accordingly
the
members
of
the
clan
worship
a
goddess
not
a
god
these
families
or
clans
with
female
descent
and
a
worship
of
goddesses
rather
than
of
gods
are
grouped
together
in
villages
each
village
comprising
about
a
score
of
clans
and
forming
with
its
lands
a
petty
independent
state
every
such
has
its
special
deity
or
deities
generally
a
god
and
a
goddess
but
these
political
deities
of
the
villages
are
said
to
be
directly
derived
from
the
domestic
deities
of
the
families
or
clans
from
which
it
seems
to
follow
that
among
these
people
gods
are
historically
later
than
goddesses
and
have
been
developed
out
of
them
the
late
origin
of
the
gods
as
compared
with
the
goddesses
is
further
indicated
by
the
nature
of
their
names
this
preference
for
goddesses
over
gods
in
the
clans
of
the
pelew
islanders
has
been
explained
no
doubt
rightly
by
the
high
importance
of
women
in
the
social
system
of
the
people
for
the
existence
of
the
clan
depends
entirely
on
the
life
of
the
women
not
at
all
upon
the
life
of
the
men
if
the
women
survive
it
is
no
matter
though
every
man
of
the
clan
should
perish
for
the
women
will
as
usual
marry
men
of
another
clan
and
their
offspring
will
inherit
their
mother
s
clan
thereby
prolonging
its
existence
whereas
if
the
women
of
the
clan
all
die
out
the
clan
necessarily
becomes
extinct
even
though
every
man
of
it
should
survive
for
the
men
must
as
usual
marry
women
of
another
clan
and
their
offspring
will
inherit
their
mothers
clan
not
the
clan
of
their
fathers
which
accordingly
with
the
death
of
the
fathers
is
wiped
out
from
the
community
hence
in
these
islands
women
bear
the
titles
of
a
mothers
of
the
land
and
a
mothers
of
the
clan
and
they
are
said
to
enjoy
complete
equality
with
the
men
in
every
respect
indeed
in
one
passage
our
principal
authority
speaks
of
the
predominance
of
feminine
influence
in
the
social
condition
of
the
people
and
asserts
without
qualification
that
the
women
are
politically
and
socially
superior
to
the
men
the
eldest
women
of
the
clan
exercise
he
tells
us
the
most
decisive
influence
on
the
conduct
of
its
affairs
and
the
headman
does
nothing
without
full
consultation
with
them
a
consultation
which
in
the
great
houses
extends
to
affairs
of
state
and
foreign
politics
nay
these
elder
women
are
even
esteemed
and
treated
as
equal
to
the
deities
in
their
lifetime
but
the
high
position
which
women
thus
take
in
pelew
society
is
not
a
result
of
only
it
has
an
industrial
as
well
as
a
kinship
basis
for
the
pelew
islanders
subsist
mainly
on
the
produce
of
their
taro
fields
and
the
cultivation
of
this
their
staple
food
is
the
business
of
the
women
alone
this
cardinal
branch
of
pelew
agriculture
which
is
of
paramount
importance
for
the
subsistence
of
the
people
is
left
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
women
this
fact
may
have
contributed
materially
to
the
predominance
of
female
influence
in
the
social
condition
of
the
people
the
women
do
not
merely
bestow
life
on
the
people
they
also
do
that
which
is
most
essential
for
the
preservation
of
life
and
therefore
they
are
called
a
the
mothers
of
the
land
and
are
politically
and
socially
superior
to
men
only
their
offspring
enjoy
the
privilege
of
membership
of
the
state
the
children
of
the
men
are
strictly
speaking
strangers
destitute
of
rights
and
the
oldest
women
of
the
families
are
esteemed
and
treated
as
equal
to
deities
even
in
their
lifetime
and
they
exercise
a
decisive
influence
on
the
conduct
of
affairs
of
state
no
chief
would
venture
to
come
to
a
decision
without
first
consulting
with
the
a
the
mothers
of
the
from
this
point
of
view
it
is
impossible
to
regard
the
assignment
of
the
taro
cultivation
to
women
as
a
consequence
of
their
subordinate
position
in
society
the
women
themselves
do
not
so
regard
it
the
richest
woman
of
the
village
looks
with
pride
on
her
taro
patch
and
although
she
has
female
followers
enough
to
allow
her
merely
to
superintend
the
work
without
taking
part
in
it
she
nevertheless
prefers
to
lay
aside
her
fine
apron
and
to
betake
herself
to
the
deep
mire
clad
in
a
small
apron
that
hardly
hides
her
nakedness
with
a
little
mat
on
her
back
to
protect
her
from
the
burning
heat
of
the
sun
and
with
a
shade
of
banana
leaves
for
her
eyes
there
dripping
with
sweat
in
the
burning
sun
and
coated
with
mud
to
the
hips
and
over
the
elbows
she
toils
to
set
the
younger
women
a
good
example
moreover
as
in
every
other
occupation
the
the
gods
must
also
be
invoked
and
who
could
be
better
fitted
for
the
discharge
of
so
important
a
duty
than
the
mother
of
the
house
it
seems
clear
that
in
any
agricultural
people
who
like
the
pelew
islanders
retain
and
depute
the
labours
of
husbandry
to
women
the
conception
of
a
great
mother
goddess
the
divine
source
of
all
fertility
might
easily
originate
perhaps
the
same
social
and
industrial
conditions
may
have
combined
to
develop
the
great
mother
goddesses
of
western
asia
and
egypt
but
in
the
pelew
islands
women
have
yet
another
road
to
power
for
some
of
them
are
reputed
to
be
the
wives
of
gods
and
act
as
their
oracular
mouthpieces
such
prophetesses
are
called
and
no
surprise
is
felt
when
one
of
them
is
brought
to
bed
her
child
passes
for
the
offspring
of
the
god
her
divine
husband
and
goes
about
with
his
hair
hanging
loose
in
token
of
his
superhuman
parentage
it
is
thought
that
no
mortal
man
would
dare
to
intrigue
with
one
of
these
human
wives
of
a
god
since
the
jealous
deity
would
surely
visit
the
rash
culprit
with
deadly
sickness
and
a
lingering
decline
but
in
these
islands
men
as
well
as
women
are
often
possessed
by
a
deity
and
speak
in
his
name
under
his
inspiration
they
mimic
often
with
great
histrionic
skill
the
particular
appearance
and
manner
which
are
believed
to
be
characteristic
of
the
indwelling
divinity
these
inspired
men
usually
enjoy
great
consideration
and
exert
a
powerful
influence
over
the
whole
community
they
always
acquire
wealth
in
the
exercise
of
their
profession
when
they
are
not
themselves
chiefs
they
are
treated
as
chiefs
or
even
preferred
to
them
in
not
a
few
places
the
deity
whom
they
personate
is
also
the
political
head
of
the
land
and
in
that
case
his
inspired
priest
however
humble
his
origin
ranks
as
a
spiritual
king
and
rules
over
all
the
chiefs
indeed
we
are
told
that
with
the
physical
and
intellectual
decay
of
the
race
the
power
of
the
priests
is
more
and
more
in
the
ascendant
and
threatens
if
unchecked
to
develop
before
long
into
an
absolute
theocracy
which
will
swallow
up
every
other
form
of
government
thus
the
present
or
at
least
the
recent
state
of
society
and
religion
in
the
pelew
islands
presents
some
interesting
parallels
to
the
social
and
religious
condition
of
western
asia
and
egypt
in
early
days
if
the
conclusions
reached
in
this
work
are
correct
in
both
regions
we
see
a
society
based
on
developing
a
religion
in
which
goddesses
of
the
clan
originally
occupied
the
foremost
place
though
in
later
times
as
the
clans
coalesced
into
states
the
old
goddesses
have
been
rivalled
and
to
some
extent
supplanted
by
the
new
male
gods
of
the
enlarged
pantheon
but
in
the
religion
of
the
pelew
islanders
as
in
that
of
the
khasis
and
the
ancient
egyptians
the
balance
of
power
has
never
wholly
shifted
from
the
female
to
the
male
line
because
society
has
never
passed
from
to
and
in
the
pelew
islands
as
in
the
ancient
east
we
see
the
tide
of
political
power
running
strongly
in
the
direction
of
theocracy
the
people
resigning
the
conduct
of
affairs
into
the
hands
of
men
who
claimed
to
rule
them
in
the
name
of
the
gods
in
the
pelew
islands
such
men
might
have
developed
into
divine
kings
like
those
of
babylon
and
egypt
if
the
natural
course
of
evolution
had
not
been
cut
short
by
the
intervention
of
europe
the
evidence
of
the
khasis
and
the
pelew
islanders
two
peoples
very
remote
and
very
different
from
each
other
suffices
to
prove
that
the
influence
which
may
exert
on
religion
is
real
and
deep
but
in
order
to
dissipate
misapprehensions
which
appear
to
be
rife
on
this
subject
it
may
be
well
to
remind
or
inform
the
reader
that
the
ancient
and
widespread
custom
of
tracing
descent
and
inheriting
property
through
the
mother
alone
does
not
by
any
means
imply
that
the
government
of
the
tribes
which
observe
the
custom
is
in
the
hands
of
women
in
short
it
should
always
be
borne
in
mind
that
does
not
mean
on
the
contrary
the
practice
of
prevails
most
extensively
amongst
the
lowest
savages
with
whom
woman
instead
of
being
the
ruler
of
man
is
always
his
drudge
and
often
little
better
than
his
slave
indeed
so
far
is
the
system
from
implying
any
social
superiority
of
women
that
it
probably
took
its
rise
from
what
we
should
regard
as
their
deepest
degradation
to
wit
from
a
state
of
society
in
which
the
relations
of
the
sexes
were
so
loose
and
vague
that
children
could
not
be
fathered
on
any
particular
man
when
we
pass
from
the
purely
savage
state
to
that
higher
plane
of
culture
in
which
the
accumulation
of
property
and
especially
of
landed
property
has
become
a
powerful
instrument
of
social
and
political
influence
we
naturally
find
that
wherever
the
ancient
preference
for
the
female
line
of
descent
has
been
retained
it
tends
to
increase
the
importance
and
enhance
the
dignity
of
woman
and
her
aggrandizement
is
most
marked
in
princely
families
where
she
either
herself
holds
royal
authority
as
well
as
private
property
or
at
least
transmits
them
both
to
her
consort
or
her
children
but
this
social
advance
of
women
has
never
been
carried
so
far
as
to
place
men
as
a
whole
in
a
position
of
political
subordination
to
them
even
where
the
system
of
in
regard
to
descent
and
property
has
prevailed
most
fully
the
actual
government
has
generally
if
not
invariably
remained
in
the
hands
of
men
exceptions
have
no
doubt
occurred
women
have
occasionally
arisen
who
by
sheer
force
of
character
have
swayed
for
a
time
the
destinies
of
their
people
but
such
exceptions
are
rare
and
their
effects
transitory
they
do
not
affect
the
truth
of
the
general
rule
that
human
society
has
been
governed
in
the
past
and
human
nature
remaining
the
same
is
likely
to
be
governed
in
the
future
mainly
by
masculine
force
and
masculine
intelligence
to
this
rule
the
khasis
with
their
elaborate
system
of
form
no
exception
for
among
them
while
landed
property
is
both
transmitted
through
women
and
held
by
women
alone
political
power
is
transmitted
indeed
through
women
but
is
held
by
men
in
other
words
the
khasi
tribes
are
with
a
single
exception
governed
by
kings
not
by
queens
and
even
in
the
one
tribe
which
is
nominally
ruled
by
women
the
real
power
is
delegated
by
the
reigning
queen
or
high
priestess
to
her
son
her
nephew
or
a
more
distant
male
relation
in
all
the
other
tribes
the
kingship
may
be
held
by
a
woman
only
on
the
failure
of
all
male
heirs
in
the
female
line
so
far
is
from
implying
a
khasi
king
inherits
power
in
right
of
his
mother
but
he
exercises
it
in
his
own
similarly
the
pelew
islanders
in
spite
of
their
system
of
are
governed
by
chiefs
not
by
chieftainesses
it
is
true
that
there
are
chieftainesses
and
that
they
indirectly
exercise
much
influence
but
their
direct
authority
is
limited
to
the
affairs
of
women
especially
to
the
administration
of
the
women
s
clubs
or
associations
which
answer
to
the
clubs
or
associations
of
the
men
and
to
take
another
example
the
melanesians
like
the
khasis
and
the
pelew
islanders
have
the
system
of
being
similarly
divided
into
exogamous
clans
with
descent
in
the
female
line
but
it
must
be
understood
that
the
mother
is
in
no
way
the
head
of
the
family
the
house
of
the
family
is
the
father
s
the
garden
is
his
the
rule
and
government
are
we
may
safely
assume
that
the
practice
has
been
the
same
among
all
the
many
peoples
who
have
retained
the
ancient
system
of
under
a
monarchical
constitution
in
africa
for
example
the
chieftainship
or
kingship
often
descends
in
the
female
line
but
it
is
men
not
women
who
inherit
it
the
theory
of
a
gynaecocracy
is
in
truth
a
dream
of
visionaries
and
pedants
and
equally
chimerical
is
the
idea
that
the
predominance
of
goddesses
under
a
system
of
like
that
of
the
khasis
is
a
creation
of
the
female
mind
if
women
ever
created
gods
they
would
be
more
likely
to
give
them
masculine
than
feminine
features
in
point
of
fact
the
great
religious
ideals
which
have
permanently
impressed
themselves
on
the
world
seem
always
to
have
been
a
product
of
the
male
imagination
men
make
gods
and
women
worship
them
the
combination
of
with
furnishes
a
simple
and
sufficient
explanation
of
the
superiority
of
goddesses
over
gods
in
a
state
of
society
where
these
conditions
prevail
men
naturally
assign
the
first
place
in
their
devotions
to
the
ancestress
from
whom
they
trace
their
descent
we
need
not
resort
to
a
fantastic
hypothesis
of
the
preponderance
of
the
feminine
fancy
in
order
to
account
for
the
facts
the
theory
that
under
a
system
of
the
women
rule
the
men
and
set
up
goddesses
for
them
to
worship
is
indeed
so
improbable
in
itself
and
so
contrary
to
experience
that
it
scarcely
deserves
the
serious
attention
which
it
appears
to
have
received
but
when
we
have
brushed
aside
these
cobwebs
as
we
must
do
we
are
still
left
face
to
face
with
the
solid
fact
of
the
wide
prevalence
of
that
is
of
a
social
system
which
traces
descent
and
transmits
property
through
women
and
not
through
men
that
a
social
system
so
widely
spread
and
so
deeply
rooted
should
have
affected
the
religion
of
the
peoples
who
practise
it
may
reasonably
be
inferred
especially
when
we
remember
that
in
primitive
communities
the
social
relations
of
the
gods
commonly
reflect
the
social
relations
of
their
worshippers
how
the
system
of
may
mould
religious
ideas
and
customs
creating
goddesses
and
assigning
at
least
a
nominal
superiority
to
priestesses
over
priests
is
shown
with
perfect
lucidity
by
the
example
of
the
khasis
and
hardly
less
clearly
by
the
example
of
the
pelew
islanders
it
can
not
therefore
be
rash
to
hold
that
what
the
system
has
certainly
done
for
these
peoples
it
may
well
have
done
for
many
more
but
unfortunately
through
lack
of
documentary
evidence
we
are
seldom
able
to
trace
its
influence
so
clearly
and
mother
goddesses
in
the
ancient
east
while
the
combination
of
in
society
with
a
preference
for
goddesses
in
religion
is
to
be
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
among
the
khasis
and
pelew
islanders
of
the
former
prevalence
of
in
the
lands
where
the
great
goddesses
astarte
and
cybele
were
worshipped
is
a
matter
of
inference
only
in
later
times
had
certainly
displaced
among
the
semitic
worshippers
of
astarte
and
probably
the
same
change
had
taken
place
among
the
phrygian
worshippers
of
cybele
yet
the
older
custom
lingered
in
lycia
down
to
the
historical
period
and
we
may
conjecture
that
in
former
times
it
was
widely
spread
through
asia
minor
the
secluded
situation
and
rugged
mountains
of
lycia
favoured
the
survival
of
a
native
language
and
of
native
institutions
long
after
these
had
disappeared
from
the
wide
plains
and
fertile
valleys
which
lay
on
the
highroads
of
war
and
commerce
lycia
was
to
asia
minor
what
the
highlands
of
wales
and
of
scotland
have
been
to
britain
the
last
entrenchments
where
the
old
race
stood
at
bay
and
even
among
the
semites
of
antiquity
though
finally
prevailed
in
matters
of
descent
and
property
traces
of
an
older
system
of
with
its
looser
sexual
relations
appear
to
have
long
survived
in
the
sphere
of
religion
at
all
events
one
of
the
most
learned
and
acute
of
semitic
scholars
adduced
what
he
regarded
as
evidence
sufficient
to
prove
that
in
old
arabian
religion
gods
and
goddesses
often
occurred
in
pairs
the
goddess
being
the
greater
so
that
the
god
can
not
be
her
baal
that
the
goddess
is
often
a
mother
without
being
a
wife
and
the
god
her
son
and
that
the
progress
of
things
was
towards
changing
goddesses
into
gods
or
lowering
them
beneath
the
male
in
egypt
the
archaic
system
of
with
its
preference
for
women
over
men
in
matters
of
property
and
inheritance
lasted
down
to
roman
times
and
it
was
traditionally
based
on
the
example
of
isis
who
had
avenged
her
husband
s
murder
and
had
continued
to
reign
after
his
decease
conferring
benefits
on
mankind
for
these
reasons
says
diodorus
siculus
it
was
appointed
that
the
queen
should
enjoy
greater
power
and
honour
than
the
king
and
that
among
private
people
the
wife
should
rule
over
her
husband
in
the
marriage
contract
the
husband
agreeing
to
obey
his
wife
in
all
a
corollary
of
the
superior
position
thus
conceded
to
women
in
egypt
was
that
the
obligation
of
maintaining
parents
in
their
old
age
rested
on
the
daughters
not
on
the
sons
of
the
family
the
same
legal
superiority
of
women
over
men
accounts
for
the
most
remarkable
feature
in
the
social
system
of
the
ancient
egyptians
to
wit
the
marriage
of
full
brothers
with
full
sisters
that
marriage
which
to
us
seems
strange
and
unnatural
was
by
no
means
a
whim
of
the
reigning
ptolemies
on
the
contrary
these
macedonian
conquerors
appear
with
characteristic
prudence
to
have
borrowed
the
custom
from
their
egyptian
predecessors
for
the
express
purpose
of
conciliating
native
prejudice
in
the
eyes
of
the
egyptians
marriage
between
brother
and
sister
was
the
best
of
marriages
and
it
acquired
an
ineffable
degree
of
sanctity
when
the
brother
and
sister
who
contracted
it
were
themselves
born
of
a
brother
and
sister
who
had
in
their
turn
also
sprung
from
a
union
of
the
same
nor
did
the
principle
apply
only
to
gods
and
kings
the
common
people
acted
on
it
in
their
daily
life
they
regarded
marriages
between
brothers
and
sisters
as
the
most
natural
and
reasonable
of
all
the
evidence
of
legal
documents
including
marriage
contracts
tends
to
prove
that
such
unions
were
the
rule
not
the
exception
in
ancient
egypt
and
that
they
continued
to
form
the
majority
of
marriages
long
after
the
romans
had
obtained
a
firm
footing
in
the
country
as
we
can
not
suppose
that
roman
influence
was
used
to
promote
a
custom
which
must
have
been
abhorrent
to
roman
instincts
we
may
safely
assume
that
the
proportion
of
brother
and
sister
marriages
in
egypt
had
been
still
greater
in
the
days
when
the
country
was
free
it
would
doubtless
be
a
mistake
to
treat
these
marriages
as
a
relic
of
savagery
as
a
survival
of
a
tribal
communism
which
knew
no
bar
to
the
intercourse
of
the
sexes
for
such
a
theory
would
not
explain
why
union
with
a
sister
was
not
only
allowed
but
preferred
to
all
others
the
true
motive
of
that
preference
was
most
probably
the
wish
of
brothers
to
obtain
for
their
own
use
the
family
property
which
belonged
of
right
to
their
sisters
and
which
otherwise
they
would
have
seen
in
the
enjoyment
of
strangers
the
husbands
of
their
sisters
this
is
the
system
which
in
ceylon
is
known
as
marriage
under
it
the
daughter
not
the
son
is
the
heir
she
stays
at
home
and
her
husband
comes
and
lives
with
her
in
the
house
but
her
brother
goes
away
and
dwells
in
his
wife
s
home
inheriting
nothing
from
his
parents
such
a
system
could
not
fail
in
time
to
prove
irksome
men
would
be
loth
to
quit
the
old
home
resign
the
ancestral
property
to
a
stranger
and
go
out
to
seek
their
fortune
in
the
world
the
remedy
was
obvious
a
man
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
marry
his
sister
himself
instead
of
handing
her
over
to
another
having
done
so
he
stayed
at
home
and
enjoyed
the
family
estate
in
virtue
of
his
marriage
with
the
heiress
this
simple
and
perfectly
effective
expedient
for
keeping
the
property
in
the
family
most
probably
explains
the
custom
of
brother
and
sister
marriage
in
egypt
thus
the
union
of
osiris
with
his
sister
isis
was
not
a
freak
of
the
s
fancy
it
reflected
a
social
custom
which
was
itself
based
on
practical
considerations
of
the
most
solid
kind
when
we
reflect
that
this
practice
of
as
opposed
to
survived
down
to
the
latest
times
of
antiquity
not
in
an
obscure
and
barbarous
tribe
but
in
a
nation
whose
immemorial
civilization
was
its
glory
and
the
wonder
of
the
world
we
may
without
being
extravagant
suppose
that
a
similar
practice
formerly
prevailed
in
syria
and
phrygia
and
that
it
accounts
for
the
superiority
of
the
goddess
over
the
god
in
the
divine
partnerships
of
adonis
and
astarte
of
attis
and
cybele
but
the
ancient
system
both
of
society
and
of
religion
had
undergone
far
more
change
in
these
countries
than
in
egypt
where
to
the
last
the
main
outlines
of
the
old
structure
could
be
traced
in
the
national
institutions
to
which
the
egyptians
clung
with
a
passionate
a
fanatical
devotion
the
divinity
of
kings
and
queens
a
sense
of
the
original
connexion
of
the
gods
with
things
outlived
the
persian
the
macedonian
the
roman
conquest
and
only
perished
under
the
more
powerful
solvent
of
christianity
but
the
old
order
did
not
vanish
at
once
with
the
official
establishment
of
the
new
religion
in
the
age
of
constantine
the
greeks
of
egypt
still
attributed
the
rise
of
the
nile
to
serapis
the
later
form
of
osiris
alleging
that
the
inundation
could
not
take
place
if
the
standard
cubit
which
was
used
to
measure
it
were
not
deposited
according
to
custom
in
the
temple
of
the
god
the
emperor
ordered
the
cubit
to
be
transferred
to
a
church
and
next
year
to
the
general
surprise
the
river
rose
just
as
usual
even
at
a
later
time
athanasius
himself
had
to
confess
with
sorrow
and
indignation
that
under
his
own
eyes
the
egyptians
still
annually
mourned
the
death
of
osiris
the
end
came
with
the
destruction
of
the
great
serapeum
at
alexandria
the
last
stronghold
of
the
heathen
in
egypt
it
perished
in
a
furious
and
bloody
sedition
in
which
christians
and
pagans
seem
to
have
vied
with
each
other
in
mutual
atrocities
after
its
fall
the
temples
were
levelled
with
the
ground
or
converted
into
churches
and
the
images
of
the
old
gods
went
to
the
to
be
converted
into
base
uses
for
the
rabble
of
alexandria
the
singular
tenacity
with
which
the
egyptian
people
maintained
their
traditional
beliefs
and
customs
for
thousands
of
years
sprang
no
doubt
from
the
stubborn
conservatism
of
the
national
character
yet
that
conservatism
was
itself
in
great
measure
an
effect
of
geographical
and
climatic
conditions
and
of
the
ways
of
life
which
they
favoured
surrounded
on
every
side
by
deserts
or
almost
harbourless
seas
the
egyptians
occupied
a
position
of
great
natural
strength
which
for
long
ages
together
protected
them
from
invasion
and
allowed
their
native
habits
to
set
and
harden
undisturbed
by
the
subversive
influence
of
foreign
conquest
the
wonderful
regularity
of
nature
in
egypt
also
conduced
to
a
corresponding
stability
in
the
minds
of
the
people
year
in
year
out
the
immutable
succession
of
the
seasons
brought
with
it
the
same
unvarying
round
of
agricultural
toil
what
the
fathers
had
done
the
sons
did
in
the
same
manner
at
the
same
season
and
so
it
went
on
from
generation
to
generation
this
monotonous
routine
is
common
indeed
to
all
purely
agricultural
communities
and
everywhere
tends
to
beget
in
the
husbandman
a
settled
phlegmatic
habit
of
mind
very
different
from
the
mobility
the
alertness
the
pliability
of
character
which
the
hazards
and
uncertainties
of
commerce
and
the
sea
foster
in
the
merchant
and
the
sailor
the
saturnine
temperament
of
the
farmer
is
as
naturally
averse
to
change
as
the
more
mercurial
spirit
of
the
trader
and
the
seaman
is
predisposed
to
it
but
the
stereotyping
of
ideas
and
of
customs
was
carried
further
in
egypt
than
in
most
lands
devoted
to
husbandry
by
reason
of
the
greater
uniformity
of
the
egyptian
seasons
and
the
more
complete
isolation
of
the
country
the
general
effect
of
these
causes
was
to
create
a
type
of
national
character
which
presented
many
points
of
resemblance
to
that
of
the
chinese
in
both
we
see
the
same
inflexible
strength
of
will
the
same
astonishing
industry
the
same
strange
blend
of
humanity
and
savagery
the
same
obstinate
adherence
to
tradition
the
same
pride
of
race
and
of
ancient
civilization
the
same
contempt
for
foreigners
as
for
upstarts
and
barbarians
the
same
patient
outward
submission
to
an
alien
rule
combined
with
an
unshakeable
inward
devotion
to
native
ideals
it
was
this
conservative
temper
of
the
people
bred
in
great
measure
of
the
physical
nature
of
their
land
which
so
to
say
embalmed
the
memory
of
osiris
long
after
the
corresponding
figures
of
adonis
and
attis
had
suffered
decay
for
while
egypt
enjoyed
profound
repose
the
tides
of
war
and
conquest
of
traffic
and
commerce
had
for
centuries
rolled
over
western
asia
the
native
home
of
adonis
and
attis
and
if
the
shock
of
nationalities
in
this
great
of
east
and
west
was
favourable
to
the
rise
of
new
faiths
and
new
moralities
it
was
in
the
same
measure
unfavourable
to
the
preservation
of
the
old
notes
moloch
the
king
i
can
not
leave
the
evidence
for
the
sacred
character
of
jewish
kings
without
mentioning
a
suggestion
which
was
made
to
me
by
my
friend
and
teacher
the
rev
professor
kennett
he
thinks
that
moloch
to
whom
children
were
burnt
by
their
parents
in
the
valley
of
hinnom
outside
the
walls
of
jerusalem
may
have
been
originally
the
human
king
regarded
as
an
incarnate
deity
certainly
the
name
of
moloch
or
rather
molech
for
so
it
is
always
written
in
the
massoretic
text
is
merely
a
slightly
disguised
form
of
the
ordinary
hebrew
word
for
king
the
scribes
having
apparently
given
the
dreadful
word
the
vowels
of
bosheth
shameful
but
it
seems
clear
that
in
historical
times
the
jews
who
offered
these
sacrifices
identified
molech
not
with
the
human
king
but
with
jehovah
though
the
prophets
protested
against
the
custom
as
an
outrage
on
the
divine
majesty
if
however
these
sacrifices
were
originally
offered
to
or
in
behalf
of
the
human
king
it
is
possible
that
they
were
intended
to
prolong
his
life
and
strengthen
his
hands
for
the
performance
of
those
magical
functions
which
he
was
expected
to
discharge
for
the
good
of
his
people
the
old
kings
of
sweden
answered
with
their
heads
for
the
fertility
of
the
ground
and
we
read
that
one
of
them
aun
or
on
by
name
sacrificed
nine
of
his
sons
to
odin
at
upsala
in
order
that
his
own
life
might
be
spared
after
the
sacrifice
of
his
second
son
he
received
from
the
god
an
oracle
that
he
should
live
as
long
as
he
gave
him
one
of
his
sons
every
tenth
year
when
he
had
thus
sacrificed
seven
sons
the
ruthless
father
still
lived
but
was
so
feeble
that
he
could
no
longer
walk
and
had
to
be
carried
in
a
chair
then
he
offered
up
his
eighth
son
and
lived
ten
years
more
bedridden
after
that
he
sacrificed
his
ninth
son
and
lived
ten
years
more
drinking
out
of
a
horn
like
a
weaned
child
he
now
wished
to
sacrifice
his
last
remaining
son
to
odin
but
the
swedes
would
not
let
him
so
he
died
and
was
buried
in
a
mound
at
upsala
in
this
swedish
tradition
the
king
s
children
seem
to
have
been
looked
upon
as
substitutes
offered
to
the
god
in
place
of
their
father
and
apparently
this
was
also
the
current
explanation
of
the
slaughter
of
the
in
the
later
times
of
israel
on
that
view
the
sacrifices
were
vicarious
and
therefore
purely
religious
being
intended
to
propitiate
a
stern
and
exacting
deity
similarly
we
read
that
when
amestris
wife
of
xerxes
was
grown
old
she
sacrificed
on
her
behalf
twice
seven
noble
children
to
the
earth
god
by
burying
them
alive
if
the
story
is
it
rests
on
the
authority
of
herodotus
a
nearly
contemporary
may
surmise
that
the
aged
queen
acted
thus
with
an
eye
to
the
future
rather
than
to
the
past
she
hoped
that
the
grim
god
of
the
would
accept
the
young
victims
in
her
stead
and
let
her
live
for
many
years
the
same
idea
of
vicarious
suffering
comes
out
in
a
tradition
told
of
a
certain
hova
king
of
madagascar
who
bore
the
sonorous
name
of
andriamasinavalona
when
he
had
grown
sickly
and
feeble
the
oracle
was
consulted
as
to
the
best
way
of
restoring
him
to
health
the
following
result
was
the
consequence
of
the
directions
of
the
oracle
a
speech
was
first
delivered
to
the
people
offering
great
honours
and
rewards
to
the
family
of
any
individual
who
would
freely
offer
himself
to
be
sacrificed
in
order
to
the
king
s
recovery
the
people
shuddered
at
the
idea
and
ran
away
in
different
directions
one
man
however
presented
himself
for
the
purpose
and
his
offer
was
accepted
the
sacrificer
girded
up
his
loins
sharpened
his
knife
and
bound
the
victim
after
which
he
was
laid
down
with
his
head
towards
the
east
upon
a
mat
spread
for
the
purpose
according
to
the
custom
with
animals
on
such
occasions
when
the
priest
appeared
to
proceed
with
all
solemnity
in
slaughtering
the
victim
by
cutting
his
throat
a
quantity
of
red
liquid
however
which
had
been
prepared
from
a
native
dye
was
spilled
in
the
ceremony
and
to
the
amazement
of
those
who
looked
on
blood
seemed
to
be
flowing
all
around
the
man
as
might
be
supposed
was
unhurt
but
the
king
rewarded
him
and
his
descendants
with
the
perpetual
privilege
of
exemption
from
capital
punishment
for
any
violation
of
the
laws
the
descendants
of
the
man
to
this
day
form
a
particular
class
called
maty
which
may
be
translated
not
dead
though
instances
frequently
occur
of
individuals
of
this
class
appropriating
bullocks
rice
and
other
things
belonging
to
the
sovereign
as
if
they
were
their
own
and
escaping
merely
with
a
reprimand
while
a
common
person
would
have
to
suffer
death
or
be
reduced
to
sometimes
however
the
practices
intended
to
prolong
the
king
s
life
seem
to
rest
on
a
theory
of
nutrition
rather
than
of
substitution
in
other
words
the
life
of
the
victims
instead
of
being
offered
vicariously
to
a
god
is
apparently
supposed
to
pass
directly
into
the
body
of
the
sacrificer
thus
refreshing
his
failing
strength
and
prolonging
his
existence
so
regarded
the
custom
is
magical
rather
than
religious
in
character
since
the
desired
effect
is
thought
to
follow
directly
without
the
intervention
of
a
deity
at
all
events
it
can
be
shown
that
sacrifices
of
this
sort
have
been
offered
to
prolong
the
life
of
kings
in
other
parts
of
the
world
thus
in
regard
to
some
of
the
negroes
who
inhabit
the
delta
of
the
niger
we
read
that
a
custom
which
formerly
was
practised
by
the
ibani
and
is
still
prevalent
among
all
the
interior
tribes
consists
in
prolonging
the
life
of
a
king
or
ancestral
representative
by
the
daily
or
possibly
weekly
sacrifice
of
a
chicken
and
egg
every
morning
as
soon
as
the
patriarch
has
risen
from
his
bed
the
sacrificial
articles
are
procured
either
by
his
mother
head
wife
or
eldest
daughter
and
given
to
the
priest
who
receives
them
on
the
open
space
in
front
of
the
house
when
this
has
been
reported
to
the
patriarch
he
comes
outside
and
sitting
down
joins
in
the
ceremony
taking
the
chicken
in
his
hand
the
priest
first
of
all
touches
the
patriarch
s
face
with
it
and
afterwards
passes
it
over
the
whole
of
his
body
he
then
cuts
its
throat
and
allows
the
blood
to
drop
on
the
ground
mixing
the
blood
and
the
earth
into
a
paste
he
rubs
it
on
the
old
man
s
forehead
and
breast
and
this
is
not
to
be
washed
off
under
any
circumstances
until
the
evening
the
chicken
and
the
egg
also
a
piece
of
white
cloth
are
now
tied
on
to
a
stick
which
if
a
stream
is
in
the
near
vicinity
is
planted
in
the
ground
at
the
during
the
carriage
of
these
articles
to
the
place
in
question
all
the
wives
and
many
members
of
the
household
accompany
the
priest
invoking
the
deity
as
they
go
to
prolong
their
father
s
life
this
is
done
in
the
firm
conviction
that
through
the
sacrifice
of
each
chicken
his
life
will
be
accordingly
the
ceremony
thus
described
is
like
so
many
other
rites
a
combination
of
magic
and
religion
for
whereas
the
prayers
to
the
god
are
religious
the
passing
of
the
victim
over
the
king
s
body
and
the
smearing
of
him
with
its

plainly
intended
to
convey
to
him
directly
without
the
mediation
of
any
deity
the
life
of
the
fowl
in
the
following
instances
the
practices
for
prolonging
the
king
s
life
seem
to
be
purely
magical
among
the
zulus
at
one
of
the
annual
feasts
of
a
bull
is
killed
by
a
particular
regiment
in
slaughtering
the
beast
they
may
not
use
spears
or
sticks
but
must
break
its
neck
or
choke
it
with
their
bare
hands
it
is
then
burned
and
the
strength
of
the
bull
is
supposed
to
enter
into
the
king
thereby
prolonging
his
again
in
an
early
portuguese
historian
we
read
of
a
caffre
king
of
east
africa
that
it
is
related
of
this
monomotapa
that
he
has
a
house
where
he
commands
bodies
of
men
who
have
died
at
the
hands
of
the
law
to
be
hung
up
and
where
thus
hanging
all
the
humidity
of
their
bodies
falls
into
vases
placed
underneath
and
when
all
has
dropped
from
them
and
they
shrink
and
dry
up
he
commands
them
to
be
taken
down
and
buried
and
with
the
fat
and
moisture
in
the
vases
they
say
he
makes
ointments
with
which
he
anoints
himself
in
order
to
enjoy
long
is
his
also
to
be
proof
against
receiving
harm
from
the
baganda
of
central
africa
used
to
kill
men
on
various
occasions
for
the
purpose
of
prolonging
the
king
s
life
in
all
cases
it
would
seem
to
be
thought
that
the
life
of
the
murdered
man
was
in
some
mysterious
fashion
transferred
to
the
king
so
that
the
monarch
received
thereby
a
fresh
accession
of
vital
energy
for
example
whenever
a
particular
royal
drum
had
a
new
skin
put
on
it
not
only
was
a
cow
killed
to
furnish
the
skin
and
its
blood
run
into
the
drum
but
a
man
was
beheaded
and
the
spouting
blood
from
the
severed
neck
was
allowed
to
gush
into
the
drum
so
that
when
the
drum
was
beaten
it
was
supposed
to
add
fresh
life
and
vigour
to
the
king
from
the
life
of
the
slain
again
at
the
coronation
of
a
new
king
a
royal
chamberlain
was
chosen
to
take
charge
of
the
king
s
inner
court
and
to
guard
his
wives
from
the
royal
presence
the
chamberlain
was
conducted
along
with
eight
captives
to
one
of
the
human
shambles
there
he
was
blindfolded
while
seven
of
the
men
were
clubbed
to
death
only
the
dull
thud
and
crashing
sound
telling
him
of
what
was
taking
place
but
when
the
seven
had
been
thus
despatched
the
bandages
were
removed
from
the
chamberlain
s
eyes
and
he
witnessed
the
death
of
the
eighth
as
each
man
was
killed
his
belly
was
ripped
open
and
his
bowels
pulled
out
and
hung
round
the
chamberlain
s
neck
these
deaths
were
said
to
add
to
the
king
s
vigour
and
to
make
the
chamberlain
strong
and
faithful
nor
were
these
the
only
human
sacrifices
offered
at
a
king
s
coronation
for
the
purpose
of
strengthening
the
new
monarch
when
the
king
had
reigned
two
or
three
months
he
was
expected
to
hunt
first
a
leopard
and
then
a
bushbuck
on
the
night
after
the
hunt
of
the
bushbuck
one
of
the
ministers
of
state
caught
a
man
and
brought
him
before
the
king
in
the
dark
the
king
speared
him
slightly
then
the
man
was
strangled
and
the
body
thrown
into
a
papyrus
swamp
that
it
might
never
be
found
again
another
ceremony
performed
about
this
time
to
confirm
the
king
in
his
kingdom
was
to
catch
a
man
bind
him
and
bring
him
before
the
king
who
wounded
him
slightly
with
a
spear
then
the
man
was
put
to
death
these
men
were
killed
to
invigorate
the
king
when
a
king
of
uganda
had
reigned
some
time
apparently
several
years
a
ceremony
was
performed
for
the
sake
of
prolonging
his
life
for
this
purpose
the
king
paid
a
fatal
a
chief
of
the
clan
who
bore
the
title
of
nankere
and
resided
in
the
district
of
busiro
where
the
tombs
and
temples
of
the
kings
were
situated
when
the
time
for
the
ceremony
had
been
appointed
the
chief
chose
one
of
his
own
sons
who
was
to
die
that
the
king
might
live
if
the
chief
had
no
son
a
near
relation
was
compelled
to
serve
as
a
substitute
the
hapless
youth
was
fed
and
clothed
and
treated
in
all
respects
like
a
prince
and
taken
to
live
in
a
particular
house
near
the
place
where
the
king
was
to
lodge
for
the
ceremony
when
the
destined
victim
had
been
feasted
and
guarded
for
a
month
the
king
set
out
on
his
progress
from
the
capital
on
the
way
he
stopped
at
the
temple
of
the
great
god
mukasa
there
he
changed
his
garments
leaving
behind
him
in
the
temple
those
which
he
had
been
wearing
also
he
left
behind
him
all
his
anklets
and
did
not
put
on
any
fresh
ones
for
he
was
shortly
to
receive
new
anklets
of
a
remarkable
kind
when
the
king
arrived
at
his
destination
the
chief
met
him
and
the
two
exchanged
a
gourd
of
beer
at
this
interview
the
king
s
mother
was
present
to
see
her
son
for
the
last
time
for
from
that
moment
the
two
were
never
allowed
to
look
upon
each
other
again
the
chief
addressed
the
king
s
mother
informing
her
of
this
final
separation
then
turning
to
the
king
he
said
you
are
now
of
age
go
and
live
longer
than
your
then
the
chief
s
son
was
introduced
the
chief
took
him
by
the
hand
and
presented
him
to
the
king
who
passed
him
on
to
the
they
led
him
outside
and
killed
him
by
beating
him
with
their
clenched
fists
the
muscles
from
the
back
of
the
body
of
the
murdered
youth
were
removed
and
made
into
two
anklets
for
the
king
and
a
strip
of
skin
cut
from
the
corpse
was
made
into
a
whip
which
was
kept
in
the
royal
enclosure
for
special
feasts
the
dead
body
was
thrown
on
waste
land
and
guarded
against
wild
beasts
but
not
buried
when
that
ceremony
was
over
the
king
departed
to
go
to
another
chief
in
busiro
but
on
the
way
thither
he
stopped
at
a
place
called
baka
and
sat
down
under
a
great
tree
to
play
a
game
of
spinning
it
is
a
children
s
game
but
it
was
no
child
s
play
to
the
man
who
ran
to
fetch
the
for
the
king
to
play
with
for
he
was
caught
and
speared
to
death
on
the
spot
for
the
purpose
of
prolonging
the
king
s
life
after
the
game
had
been
played
the
king
with
his
train
passed
on
and
lodged
with
a
certain
princess
till
the
anklets
made
from
the
muscles
of
the
chief
s
murdered
son
were
ready
for
him
to
wear
it
was
the
princess
who
had
to
superintend
the
making
of
these
royal
ornaments
when
all
these
ceremonies
were
over
the
king
made
a
great
feast
at
this
feast
a
priest
went
about
carrying
under
his
mantle
the
whip
that
had
been
made
from
the
skin
of
the
murdered
young
man
as
he
passed
through
the
crowd
of
merrymakers
he
would
flick
a
man
here
and
there
with
the
whip
and
it
was
believed
that
the
man
on
whom
the
lash
lighted
would
be
childless
and
might
die
unless
he
made
an
offering
of
either
nine
or
ninety
cowrie
shells
to
the
priest
who
had
struck
him
naturally
he
hastened
to
procure
the
shells
and
take
them
to
the
striker
who
on
receiving
them
struck
the
man
on
the
shoulder
with
his
hand
thus
restoring
to
him
the
generative
powers
of
which
the
blow
of
the
whip
had
deprived
him
at
the
end
of
the
feast
the
drummers
removed
all
the
drums
but
one
which
they
left
as
if
they
had
forgotten
it
somebody
in
the
crowd
would
notice
the
apparent
oversight
and
run
after
the
drummers
with
the
drum
saying
you
have
left
one
the
thanks
he
received
was
that
he
was
caught
and
killed
and
the
bones
of
his
upper
arm
made
into
drumsticks
for
that
particular
drum
the
drum
was
never
afterwards
brought
out
during
the
whole
of
the
king
s
reign
but
was
kept
covered
up
till
the
time
came
to
bring
it
out
on
the
corresponding
feast
of
his
successor
yet
from
time
to
time
the
priest
who
had
flicked
the
revellers
with
the
whip
of
human
skin
would
dress
himself
up
in
a
mantle
of
from
neck
to
foot
and
concealing
the
drumstick
of
human
bones
under
his
robe
would
go
into
the
king
s
presence
and
suddenly
whipping
out
the
bones
from
his
bosom
would
brandish
them
in
the
king
s
face
then
he
would
as
suddenly
hide
them
again
but
only
to
repeat
the
manoeuvre
after
that
he
retired
and
restored
the
bones
to
their
usual
place
they
were
decorated
with
cowrie
shells
and
little
bells
which
jingled
as
he
shook
them
at
the
king
the
precise
meaning
of
these
latter
ceremonies
is
obscure
but
we
may
suppose
that
just
as
the
human
blood
poured
into
a
drum
was
thought
to
pass
into
the
king
s
veins
in
the
booming
notes
of
the
drum
so
the
clicking
of
the
human
bones
and
the
jingling
of
their
bells
were
supposed
to
infuse
into
the
royal
person
the
vigour
of
the
murdered
man
the
purpose
of
flicking
commoners
with
the
whip
made
of
human
skin
is
even
more
obscure
but
we
may
conjecture
that
the
life
or
virility
of
every
man
struck
with
the
whip
was
supposed
to
be
transmitted
in
some
way
to
the
king
who
thus
recruited
his
vital
and
especially
his
reproductive
energies
at
this
solemn
feast
if
i
am
right
in
my
interpretation
all
these
baganda
modes
of
strengthening
the
king
and
prolonging
his
life
belonged
to
the
nutritive
rather
than
to
the
vicarious
type
of
sacrifice
from
which
it
will
follow
that
they
were
magical
rather
than
religious
in
character
the
same
thing
may
perhaps
be
said
of
the
wholesale
massacres
which
used
to
be
perpetrated
when
a
king
of
uganda
was
at
these
times
the
priests
informed
the
royal
patient
that
persons
marked
by
a
certain
physical
peculiarity
such
as
a
cast
of
the
eye
a
particular
gait
or
a
distinctive
colouring
must
be
put
to
death
accordingly
the
king
sent
out
his
catchpoles
who
waylaid
such
persons
in
the
roads
and
dragged
them
to
the
royal
enclosure
where
they
were
kept
until
the
tale
of
victims
prescribed
by
the
priest
was
complete
before
they
were
led
away
to
one
of
the
eight
places
of
execution
which
were
regularly
appointed
for
this
purpose
in
different
parts
of
the
kingdom
the
victims
had
to
drink
medicated
beer
with
the
king
out
of
a
special
pot
in
order
that
he
might
have
power
over
their
ghosts
lest
they
should
afterwards
come
back
to
torment
him
they
were
killed
sometimes
by
being
speared
to
death
sometimes
by
being
hacked
to
pieces
sometimes
by
being
burned
alive
contrary
to
the
usual
custom
of
the
baganda
the
bodies
or
what
remained
of
the
bodies
of
these
unfortunates
were
always
left
unburied
on
the
place
of
execution
in
what
way
precisely
the
sick
king
was
supposed
to
benefit
by
these
massacres
of
his
subjects
does
not
appear
but
we
may
surmise
that
somehow
the
victims
were
believed
to
give
their
lives
for
him
or
to
him
thus
it
is
possible
that
in
israel
also
the
sacrifices
of
children
to
moloch
were
in
like
manner
intended
to
prolong
the
life
of
the
human
king
either
by
serving
as
substitutes
for
him
or
by
recruiting
his
failing
energies
with
their
vigorous
young
life
but
it
is
equally
possible
and
perhaps
more
probable
that
the
sacrifice
of
the
children
was
only
a
particular
application
of
the
ancient
law
which
devoted
to
the
deity
the
of
every
womb
whether
of
cattle
or
of
human
beings
ii
the
widowed
flamen
the
pollution
of
death
a
different
explanation
of
the
rule
which
obliged
the
flamen
dialis
to
resign
the
priesthood
on
the
death
of
his
wife
has
been
suggested
by
my
friend
farnell
he
supposes
that
such
a
bereavement
would
render
the
flamen
ceremonially
impure
and
therefore
unfit
to
hold
office
it
is
true
that
the
ceremonial
pollution
caused
by
death
commonly
disqualifies
a
man
for
the
discharge
of
sacred
functions
but
as
a
rule
the
disqualification
is
only
temporary
and
can
be
removed
by
seclusion
and
the
observance
of
purificatory
rites
the
length
of
the
seclusion
and
the
nature
of
the
purification
varying
with
the
degree
of
relationship
in
which
the
living
stand
to
the
dead
thus
for
example
if
one
of
the
sacred
eunuchs
at
saw
the
dead
body
of
a
stranger
he
was
unclean
for
that
day
and
might
not
enter
the
sanctuary
of
the
goddess
but
next
day
after
purifying
himself
he
was
free
to
enter
but
if
the
corpse
happened
to
be
that
of
a
relation
he
was
unclean
for
thirty
days
and
had
to
shave
his
head
before
he
might
set
foot
within
the
holy
precinct
again
in
the
greek
island
of
ceos
persons
who
had
offered
the
annual
sacrifices
to
their
departed
friends
were
unclean
for
two
days
afterwards
and
might
not
enter
a
sanctuary
they
had
to
purify
themselves
with
water
similarly
no
one
might
go
into
the
shrine
of
men
tyrannus
for
ten
days
after
being
in
contact
with
the
dead
once
more
at
stratonicea
in
caria
a
chorus
of
thirty
noble
boys
clad
in
white
and
holding
branches
in
their
hands
used
to
sing
a
hymn
daily
in
honour
of
zeus
and
hecate
but
if
one
of
them
were
sick
or
had
suffered
a
domestic
bereavement
he
was
for
the
time
being
excused
not
permanently
excluded
from
the
performance
of
his
sacred
duties
on
the
analogy
of
these
and
similar
cases
we
should
expect
to
find
the
widowed
flamen
temporarily
debarred
from
the
exercise
of
his
office
not
permanently
relieved
of
it
however
in
support
of
farnell
s
view
i
would
cite
an
indian
parallel
which
was
pointed
out
to
me
by
rivers
among
the
todas
of
the
neilgherry
hills
in
southern
india
the
priestly
dairyman
is
a
sacred
personage
and
his
life
like
that
of
the
flamen
dialis
is
hedged
in
by
many
taboos
now
when
a
death
occurs
in
his
clan
the
dairyman
may
not
attend
any
of
the
funeral
ceremonies
unless
he
gives
up
office
but
he
may
be
after
the
second
funeral
ceremonies
have
been
completed
in
the
interval
his
place
must
be
taken
by
a
man
of
another
clan
some
eighteen
or
nineteen
years
ago
a
man
named
karkievan
resigned
the
office
of
dairyman
when
his
wife
died
but
two
years
later
he
was
and
has
held
office
ever
since
there
have
meantime
been
many
deaths
in
his
clan
but
he
has
not
attended
a
funeral
and
has
not
therefore
had
to
resign
his
post
again
apparently
in
old
times
a
more
stringent
rule
prevailed
and
the
dairyman
was
obliged
to
vacate
office
whenever
a
death
occurred
in
his
clan
for
according
to
tradition
the
clan
of
keadrol
was
divided
into
its
two
existing
divisions
for
the
express
purpose
of
ensuring
that
there
might
still
be
men
to
undertake
the
office
of
dairyman
when
a
death
occurred
in
the
clan
the
men
of
the
one
division
taking
office
whenever
there
was
a
death
in
the
other
at
first
sight
this
case
may
seem
exactly
parallel
to
the
case
of
the
flamen
dialis
and
the
flaminica
on
farnell
s
theory
for
here
there
can
be
no
doubt
whatever
that
it
is
the
pollution
of
death
which
disqualifies
the
sacred
dairyman
from
holding
office
since
if
he
only
avoids
that
pollution
by
not
attending
the
funeral
he
is
allowed
at
the
present
day
to
retain
his
post
on
this
analogy
we
might
suppose
that
it
was
not
so
much
the
death
of
his
wife
as
the
attendance
at
her
funeral
which
compelled
the
flamen
dialis
to
resign
especially
as
we
know
that
he
was
expressly
forbidden
to
touch
a
dead
body
or
to
enter
the
place
where
corpses
were
burned
but
a
closer
inspection
of
the
facts
proves
that
the
analogy
breaks
down
at
some
important
points
for
though
the
flamen
dialis
was
forbidden
to
touch
a
dead
body
or
to
enter
a
place
where
corpses
were
burned
he
was
permitted
to
attend
a
funeral
so
that
there
could
hardly
be
any
objection
to
his
attending
the
funeral
of
his
wife
this
permission
clearly
tells
against
the
view
that
it
was
the
mere
pollution
of
death
which
obliged
him
to
resign
office
when
his
wife
died
further
and
this
is
a
point
of
fundamental
difference
between
the
two
cases
whereas
the
flamen
dialis
was
bound
to
be
married
and
married
too
by
a
rite
of
special
solemnity
there
is
no
such
obligation
on
the
sacred
dairyman
of
the
todas
indeed
if
he
is
married
he
is
bound
to
live
apart
from
his
wife
during
his
term
of
office
surely
the
obligation
laid
on
the
flamen
dialis
to
be
married
of
itself
implies
that
with
the
death
of
his
wife
he
necessarily
ceased
to
hold
office
there
is
no
need
to
search
for
another
reason
in
the
pollution
of
death
which
as
i
have
just
shown
does
not
seem
to
square
with
the
permission
granted
to
the
flamen
to
attend
a
funeral
that
this
is
indeed
the
true
explanation
of
the
rule
in
question
is
strongly
suggested
by
the
further
and
apparently
parallel
rule
which
forbade
the
flamen
to
divorce
his
wife
nothing
but
death
might
part
them
now
the
rule
which
enjoined
that
a
flamen
must
be
married
and
the
rule
which
forbade
him
to
divorce
his
wife
have
obviously
nothing
to
do
with
the
pollution
of
death
yet
they
can
hardly
be
separated
from
the
other
rule
that
with
the
death
of
his
wife
he
vacated
office
all
three
rules
are
explained
in
the
most
natural
way
on
the
hypothesis
which
i
have
adopted
namely
that
this
married
priest
and
priestess
had
to
perform
in
common
certain
rites
which
the
husband
could
not
perform
without
his
wife
the
same
obvious
solution
of
the
problem
was
suggested
long
ago
by
plutarch
who
after
asking
why
the
flamen
dialis
had
to
lay
down
office
on
the
death
of
his
wife
says
amongst
other
things
that
perhaps
it
is
because
she
performs
sacred
rites
along
with
him
for
many
of
the
rites
may
not
be
performed
without
the
presence
of
a
married
woman
and
to
marry
another
wife
immediately
on
the
death
of
the
first
would
hardly
be
possible
or
this
simple
explanation
of
the
rule
seems
quite
sufficient
and
it
would
clearly
hold
good
whether
i
am
right
or
wrong
in
further
supposing
that
the
human
husband
and
wife
in
this
case
represented
a
divine
husband
and
wife
a
god
and
goddess
to
wit
jupiter
and
juno
or
rather
dianus
janus
and
diana
and
that
supposition
in
its
turn
might
still
hold
good
even
if
i
were
wrong
in
further
conjecturing
that
of
this
divine
pair
the
goddess
juno
or
rather
diana
was
originally
the
more
important
partner
however
it
is
to
be
explained
the
roman
rule
which
forbade
the
flamen
dialis
to
be
a
widower
has
its
parallel
among
the
kotas
a
tribe
who
like
the
todas
inhabit
the
neilgherry
hills
of
southern
india
for
the
higher
kota
priests
are
not
allowed
to
be
widowers
if
a
priest
s
wife
dies
while
he
is
in
office
his
appointment
lapses
at
the
same
time
priests
should
avoid
pollution
and
may
not
attend
a
toda
or
badaga
funeral
or
approach
the
seclusion
hut
set
apart
for
kota
jewish
priests
were
specially
permitted
to
contract
the
pollution
of
death
for
near
relations
among
whom
father
mother
son
daughter
and
unmarried
sister
are
particularly
enumerated
but
they
were
forbidden
to
contract
the
pollution
for
strangers
however
among
the
relations
for
whom
a
priest
might
thus
defile
himself
a
wife
is
not
mentioned
the
marriage
of
the
roman
gods
the
theory
that
the
flamen
dialis
and
his
wife
personated
a
divine
couple
whether
jupiter
and
juno
or
dianus
janus
and
diana
supposes
a
married
relation
between
the
god
and
goddess
and
so
far
it
would
certainly
be
untenable
if
farnell
were
right
in
assuming
on
the
authority
of
warde
fowler
that
the
roman
gods
were
celibate
on
that
subject
however
varro
the
most
learned
of
roman
antiquaries
was
of
a
contrary
opinion
he
not
only
spoke
particularly
of
juno
as
the
wife
of
jupiter
but
he
also
affirmed
generally
in
the
most
unambiguous
language
that
the
old
roman
gods
were
married
and
in
saying
so
he
referred
not
to
the
religion
of
his
own
day
which
had
been
modified
by
greek
influence
but
to
the
religion
of
the
ancient
romans
his
ancestors
seneca
ridiculed
the
marriage
of
the
roman
gods
citing
as
examples
the
marriages
of
mars
and
bellona
of
vulcan
and
venus
of
neptune
and
salacia
and
adding
sarcastically
that
some
of
the
goddesses
were
spinsters
or
widows
such
as
populonia
fulgora
and
rumina
whose
faded
charms
or
unamiable
character
had
failed
to
attract
a
suitor
again
the
learned
servius
whose
commentary
on
virgil
is
a
gold
mine
of
roman
religious
lore
informs
us
that
the
pontiffs
celebrated
the
marriage
of
the
infernal
deity
orcus
with
very
great
solemnity
and
for
this
statement
he
would
seem
to
have
had
the
authority
of
the
pontifical
books
themselves
for
he
refers
to
them
in
the
same
connexion
only
a
few
lines
before
as
it
is
in
the
highest
degree
unlikely
that
the
pontiffs
would
solemnize
any
foreign
rites
we
may
safely
assume
that
the
marriage
of
orcus
was
not
borrowed
from
greek
mythology
but
was
a
genuine
old
roman
ceremony
and
this
is
all
the
more
probable
because
servius
our
authority
for
the
custom
has
recorded
some
curious
and
obviously
ancient
taboos
which
were
observed
at
the
marriage
and
in
the
ritual
of
ceres
the
goddess
who
seems
to
have
been
joined
in
wedlock
to
orcus
one
of
these
taboos
forbade
the
use
of
wine
the
other
forbade
persons
to
name
their
father
or
daughter
further
the
learned
roman
antiquary
aulus
gellius
quotes
from
the
books
of
the
priests
of
the
roman
people
the
highest
possible
authority
on
the
subject
and
from
many
ancient
speeches
a
list
of
old
roman
deities
in
which
there
seem
to
be
at
least
five
pairs
of
males
and
females
more
than
that
he
proves
conclusively
by
quotations
from
plautus
the
annalist
cn
gellius
and
licinius
imbrex
that
these
old
writers
certainly
regarded
one
at
least
of
the
pairs
mars
and
nerio
as
husband
and
wife
and
we
have
good
ancient
evidence
for
viewing
in
the
same
light
three
others
of
the
pairs
thus
the
old
annalist
and
antiquarian
cincius
alimentus
who
fought
against
hannibal
and
was
captured
by
him
affirmed
in
his
work
on
the
roman
calendar
that
maia
was
the
wife
of
vulcan
and
as
there
was
a
flamen
of
vulcan
who
sacrificed
to
maia
on
may
day
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
he
was
assisted
in
the
ceremony
by
a
flaminica
his
wife
just
as
on
my
hypothesis
the
flamen
dialis
was
assisted
by
his
wife
the
flaminica
another
old
roman
historian
calpurnius
piso
who
wrote
in
the
second
century
said
that
the
name
of
vulcan
s
wife
was
not
maia
but
majestas
in
saying
so
he
may
have
intended
to
correct
what
he
believed
to
be
a
mistake
of
his
predecessor
cincius
again
that
salacia
was
the
wife
of
neptune
is
perhaps
implied
by
varro
and
is
positively
affirmed
by
seneca
augustine
and
servius
again
ennius
appears
to
have
regarded
hora
as
the
wife
of
quirinus
for
in
the
first
book
of
his
annals
he
declared
his
devotion
to
that
divine
pair
in
fact
of
the
five
pairs
of
male
and
female
deities
cited
by
aulus
gellius
from
the
priestly
books
and
ancient
speeches
the
only
one
as
to
which
we
have
not
independent
evidence
that
it
consisted
of
a
husband
and
wife
is
saturn
and
lua
and
in
regard
to
lua
we
know
that
she
was
spoken
of
as
a
mother
which
renders
it
not
improbable
that
she
was
also
a
wife
however
according
to
some
very
respectable
authorities
the
wife
of
saturn
was
not
lua
but
ops
so
that
we
have
two
independent
lines
of
proof
that
saturn
was
supposed
to
be
married
lastly
the
epithets
father
and
mother
which
the
romans
bestowed
on
many
of
their
deities
are
most
naturally
understood
to
imply
paternity
and
maternity
and
if
the
implication
is
admitted
the
inference
appears
to
be
inevitable
that
these
divine
beings
were
supposed
to
exercise
sexual
functions
whether
in
lawful
marriage
or
in
unlawful
concubinage
as
to
jupiter
in
particular
his
paternity
is
positively
attested
by
latin
inscriptions
one
of
them
very
old
which
describe
fortuna
primigenia
the
great
goddess
of
praeneste
as
his
daughter
again
the
rustic
deity
faunus
one
of
the
oldest
and
most
popular
gods
of
italy
was
represented
by
tradition
in
the
character
of
a
husband
and
a
father
one
of
the
epithets
applied
to
him
expressed
in
a
coarse
way
his
generative
powers
fauna
or
the
good
goddess
another
of
the
oldest
native
italian
deities
was
variously
called
his
wife
or
his
daughter
and
he
is
said
to
have
assumed
the
form
of
a
snake
in
order
to
cohabit
with
her
again
the
most
famous
of
all
roman
myths
represented
the
founder
of
rome
himself
romulus
and
his
twin
brother
remus
as
begotten
by
the
god
mars
on
a
vestal
virgin
and
every
roman
who
accepted
the
tradition
thereby
acknowledged
the
fatherhood
of
the
god
in
the
physical
not
in
a
figurative
sense
of
the
word
if
the
story
of
the
birth
of
romulus
and
remus
should
be
dismissed
as
a
late
product
of
the
mythical
fancy
working
under
greek
influence
the
same
objection
can
hardly
be
urged
against
the
story
of
the
birth
of
another
roman
king
servius
tullius
who
is
said
to
have
been
a
son
of
the
and
a
slave
woman
his
mother
conceived
him
beside
the
royal
hearth
where
she
was
impregnated
by
a
flame
that
shot
out
from
the
fire
in
the
shape
of
the
male
organ
of
generation
it
would
scarcely
be
possible
to
express
the
physical
fatherhood
of
the
in
more
unambiguous
terms
now
a
precisely
similar
story
was
told
of
the
birth
of
romulus
himself
and
we
may
suspect
that
this
was
an
older
form
of
the
story
than
the
legend
which
fathered
the
twins
on
mars
similarly
caeculus
the
founder
of
praeneste
passed
for
a
son
of
the
vulcan
it
was
said
that
his
mother
was
impregnated
by
a
spark
which
leaped
from
the
fire
and
struck
her
as
she
sat
by
the
hearth
in
later
life
when
caeculus
boasted
of
his
divine
parentage
to
a
crowd
and
they
refused
to
believe
him
he
prayed
to
his
father
to
give
the
unbelievers
a
sign
and
straightway
a
lambent
flame
surrounded
the
whole
multitude
the
proof
was
conclusive
and
henceforth
caeculus
passed
for
a
true
son
of
the
such
tales
of
kings
or
heroes
begotten
by
the
on
mortal
women
appear
to
be
genuine
old
italian
myths
which
may
well
go
back
far
beyond
the
foundation
of
rome
to
the
common
fountain
of
aryan
mythology
for
the
marriage
customs
observed
by
various
branches
of
the
aryan
family
point
clearly
to
a
belief
in
the
power
of
fire
to
impregnate
women
on
the
whole
if
we
follow
the
authority
of
the
ancients
themselves
we
seem
bound
to
conclude
that
the
roman
gods
like
those
of
many
other
early
peoples
were
believed
to
be
married
and
to
beget
children
it
is
true
that
compared
with
the
gods
of
greece
the
deities
of
rome
appear
to
us
shadowy
creatures
pale
abstractions
garbed
in
little
that
can
vie
with
the
gorgeous
pall
of
myth
and
story
which
grecian
fancy
threw
around
its
divine
creations
yet
the
few
specimens
of
roman
mythology
which
have
survived
the
wreck
of
antiquity
justify
us
in
believing
that
they
are
but
fragments
of
far
more
copious
traditions
which
have
perished
at
all
events
the
comparative
aridity
and
barrenness
of
the
roman
religious
imagination
is
no
reason
for
setting
aside
the
positive
testimony
of
learned
roman
writers
as
to
a
point
of
fundamental
importance
in
their
own
religion
about
which
they
could
hardly
be
mistaken
it
should
never
be
forgotten
that
on
this
subject
the
ancients
had
access
to
many
sources
of
information
which
are
no
longer
open
to
us
and
for
a
modern
scholar
to
reject
their
evidence
in
favour
of
a
personal
impression
derived
from
a
necessarily
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
facts
seems
scarcely
consistent
with
sound
principles
of
history
and
criticism
children
of
living
parents
in
ritual
but
farnell
adduces
another
argument
in
support
of
his
view
that
it
was
the
pollution
of
death
which
obliged
the
widowed
flamen
dialis
to
resign
the
priesthood
he
points
to
what
he
considers
the
analogy
of
the
rule
of
greek
ritual
which
required
that
certain
sacred
offices
should
be
discharged
only
by
a
boy
whose
parents
were
both
alive
this
rule
he
would
explain
in
like
manner
by
supposing
that
the
death
of
one
or
both
of
his
parents
would
render
a
boy
ceremonially
impure
and
therefore
unfit
to
perform
religious
functions
farnell
might
have
apparently
strengthened
his
case
by
observing
that
the
flamen
dialis
and
the
flaminica
dialis
were
themselves
assisted
in
their
office
the
one
by
a
boy
the
other
by
a
girl
both
of
whose
parents
must
be
alive
at
first
sight
this
fits
in
perfectly
with
his
theory
the
flamen
the
flaminica
and
their
youthful
ministers
were
all
rendered
incapable
of
performing
their
sacred
duties
by
the
taint
or
corruption
of
death
but
a
closer
scrutiny
of
the
argument
reveals
a
flaw
it
proves
too
much
for
observe
that
in
these
greek
and
roman
offices
held
by
boys
and
girls
the
disqualification
caused
by
the
death
of
a
parent
is
necessarily
lifelong
since
the
bereavement
is
irreparable
accordingly
if
farnell
s
theory
is
right
the
ceremonial
pollution
which
is
the
cause
of
the
disqualification
must
also
be
lifelong
in
other
words
every
orphan
is
ceremoniously
unclean
for
life
and
thereby
excluded
for
ever
from
the
discharge
of
sacred
duties
so
sweeping
a
rule
would
at
a
stroke
exclude
a
large
if
not
the
larger
part
of
the
population
of
any
country
from
the
offices
of
religion
and
lay
them
permanently
under
all
those
burdensome
restrictions
which
the
pollution
of
death
entails
among
many
nations
for
obviously
a
large
if
not
the
larger
part
of
the
population
of
any
country
at
any
time
has
lost
one
or
both
of
its
parents
by
death
no
people
so
far
as
i
know
has
ever
carried
the
theory
of
the
ceremonial
pollution
of
death
to
this
extremity
in
practice
and
even
if
it
were
supposed
that
the
taint
wore
off
or
evaporated
with
time
from
common
folk
so
as
to
let
them
go
about
their
common
duties
in
everyday
life
would
it
not
still
cleave
to
priests
if
it
incapacitated
the
flamen
s
minister
would
it
not
incapacitate
the
flamen
himself
in
other
words
would
not
the
flamen
dialis
be
obliged
to
vacate
office
on
the
death
of
his
father
or
mother
there
is
no
hint
in
ancient
writers
that
he
had
to
do
so
and
while
it
is
generally
unsafe
to
argue
from
the
silence
of
our
authorities
i
think
that
we
may
do
so
in
this
case
without
being
rash
for
plutarch
not
only
mentions
but
discusses
the
rule
which
obliged
the
flamen
dialis
to
resign
office
on
the
death
of
his
wife
and
if
he
had
known
of
a
parallel
rule
which
compelled
him
to
retire
on
the
death
of
a
parent
he
would
surely
have
mentioned
it
but
if
the
ceremonial
pollution
which
would
certainly
be
caused
by
the
death
of
a
parent
did
not
compel
the
flamen
dialis
to
vacate
office
we
may
safely
conclude
that
neither
did
the
similar
pollution
caused
by
the
death
of
his
wife
thus
the
argument
adduced
by
farnell
in
favour
of
his
view
proves
on
analysis
to
tell
strongly
against
it
but
if
the
rule
which
excluded
orphans
from
certain
sacred
offices
can
not
with
any
probability
be
explained
on
the
theory
of
their
ceremonial
pollution
it
may
be
worth
while
to
inquire
whether
another
and
better
explanation
of
the
rule
can
not
be
found
for
that
purpose
i
shall
collect
all
the
cases
of
it
known
to
me
the
collection
is
doubtless
far
from
complete
i
only
offer
it
as
a
for
research
at
the
time
of
the
vintage
which
in
greece
falls
in
october
athenian
boys
chosen
from
every
tribe
assembled
at
the
sanctuary
of
dionysus
the
god
of
the
vine
there
branches
of
vines
laden
with
ripe
grapes
were
given
to
them
and
holding
them
in
their
hands
they
raced
to
the
sanctuary
of
athena
sciras
the
winner
received
and
drained
a
cup
containing
a
mixture
of
wine
honey
cheese
and
it
was
necessary
that
both
the
parents
of
each
of
these
should
be
alive
at
the
same
festival
and
perhaps
on
the
same
day
an
athenian
boy
whose
parents
must
both
be
alive
carried
in
procession
a
branch
of
olive
wreathed
with
white
and
purple
wool
and
decked
with
fruits
of
many
kinds
while
a
chorus
sang
that
the
branch
bore
figs
fat
loaves
honey
oil
and
wine
thus
they
went
in
procession
to
a
temple
of
apollo
at
the
door
of
which
the
boy
deposited
the
holy
bough
the
ceremony
is
said
to
have
been
instituted
by
the
athenians
in
obedience
to
an
oracle
for
the
purpose
of
supplicating
the
help
of
the
god
in
a
season
of
dearth
similar
boughs
similarly
laden
with
fruits
and
loaves
were
hung
up
on
the
doors
of
every
athenian
house
and
allowed
to
remain
there
a
year
at
the
end
of
which
they
were
replaced
by
fresh
ones
while
the
branch
was
being
fastened
to
the
door
a
boy
whose
parents
were
both
alive
recited
the
same
verses
about
the
branch
bearing
figs
fat
loaves
honey
oil
and
wine
this
custom
also
is
said
to
have
been
instituted
for
the
sake
of
putting
an
end
to
a
dearth
the
people
of
magnesia
on
the
maeander
vowed
a
bull
every
year
to
zeus
the
saviour
of
the
city
in
the
month
of
cronion
at
the
beginning
of
sowing
and
after
maintaining
the
animal
at
the
public
expense
throughout
the
winter
they
sacrificed
it
apparently
at
in
the
following
summer
nine
boys
and
nine
girls
whose
fathers
and
mothers
were
all
living
took
part
in
the
religious
services
of
the
consecration
and
the
sacrifice
of
the
bull
at
the
consecration
public
prayers
were
offered
for
the
safety
of
the
city
and
the
land
for
the
safety
of
the
citizens
and
their
wives
and
children
for
the
safety
of
all
that
dwelt
in
the
city
and
the
land
for
peace
and
wealth
and
abundance
of
corn
and
all
other
fruits
and
for
the
cattle
a
herald
led
the
prayers
and
the
priest
and
priestess
the
boys
and
girls
the
high
officers
and
magistrates
all
joined
in
these
solemn
petitions
for
the
welfare
of
their
country
among
the
of
central
sumatra
the
threshing
of
the
rice
is
the
occasion
of
various
ceremonies
and
in
these
a
prominent
part
is
played
by
a
girl
whose
father
and
mother
must
be
both
alive
her
special
duty
is
to
take
care
of
the
sheaf
of
rice
in
which
the
soul
of
the
rice
is
believed
to
reside
this
sheaf
usually
consists
of
the
first
rice
cut
and
bound
in
the
field
it
is
treated
exactly
like
a
person
the
rites
thus
far
described
in
which
boys
and
girls
of
living
parents
took
part
were
clearly
ceremonies
intended
specially
to
ensure
the
fertility
of
the
soil
this
is
indicated
not
merely
by
the
nature
of
the
rites
and
of
the
prayers
or
verses
which
accompanied
them
but
also
by
the
seasons
at
which
they
were
observed
for
these
were
the
vintage
the
and
the
beginning
of
sowing
we
may
therefore
compare
a
custom
practised
by
the
roman
brethren
of
the
ploughed
fields
a
college
of
priests
whose
business
it
was
to
perform
the
rites
deemed
necessary
for
the
growth
of
the
corn
as
a
badge
of
office
they
wore
wreaths
of
and
paid
their
devotions
to
an
antique
goddess
of
fertility
the
dea
dia
her
home
was
in
a
grove
of
ancient
evergreen
oaks
and
laurels
out
in
the
campagna
five
miles
from
rome
hither
every
year
in
the
month
of
may
when
the
fields
were
ripe
or
ripening
to
the
sickle
reaped
ears
of
the
new
corn
were
brought
and
hallowed
by
the
brethren
with
quaint
rites
that
a
blessing
might
rest
on
the
coming
harvest
the
first
or
preliminary
consecration
of
the
ears
however
took
place
not
in
the
grove
but
in
the
house
of
the
master
of
the
brethren
at
rome
here
the
brethren
were
waited
upon
by
four
boys
the
children
of
living
fathers
and
mothers
while
the
brethren
reclined
on
couches
the
boys
were
allowed
to
sit
on
chairs
and
partake
of
the
feast
and
when
it
was
over
they
carried
the
rest
of
the
now
hallowed
corn
and
laid
it
on
the
altar
in
these
and
all
other
rites
intended
to
ensure
the
fertility
of
the
ground
of
cattle
or
of
human
beings
the
employment
of
children
of
living
parents
seems
to
be
intelligible
on
the
principle
of
sympathetic
magic
for
such
children
might
be
deemed
fuller
of
life
than
orphans
either
because
they
flourished
on
both
sides
as
the
greeks
put
it
or
because
the
very
survival
of
their
parents
might
be
taken
as
a
proof
that
the
stock
of
which
the
children
came
was
vigorous
and
therefore
able
to
impart
of
its
superabundant
energy
to
others
but
the
rites
in
which
the
children
of
living
parents
are
required
to
officiate
do
not
always
aim
at
promoting
the
growth
of
the
crops
at
olympia
the
which
formed
the
victors
crowns
had
to
be
cut
from
a
sacred
tree
with
a
golden
sickle
by
a
lad
whose
father
and
mother
must
be
both
alive
the
tree
was
a
wild
olive
growing
within
the
holy
precinct
at
the
west
end
of
the
temple
of
zeus
it
bore
the
name
of
the
olive
of
the
fair
crown
and
near
it
was
an
altar
to
the
nymphs
of
the
fair
crowns
at
delphi
every
eighth
year
a
sacred
drama
or
was
acted
which
drew
crowds
of
spectators
from
all
parts
of
greece
it
set
forth
the
slaying
of
the
dragon
by
apollo
the
principal
part
was
sustained
by
a
lad
the
son
of
living
parents
who
seems
to
have
personated
the
god
himself
in
an
open
space
the
likeness
of
a
lordly
palace
erected
for
the
occasion
represented
the
dragon
s
den
it
was
attacked
and
burned
by
the
lad
aided
by
women
who
carried
blazing
torches
when
the
dragon
had
received
his
deadly
wound
the
lad
still
acting
the
part
of
the
god
fled
far
away
to
be
purged
of
the
guilt
of
blood
in
the
beautiful
vale
of
tempe
where
the
peneus
flows
in
a
deep
wooded
gorge
between
the
snowy
peaks
of
olympus
and
ossa
its
smooth
and
silent
tide
shadowed
by
overhanging
trees
and
tall
white
cliffs
in
places
these
great
crags
rise
abruptly
from
the
stream
and
approach
each
other
so
near
that
only
a
narrow
strip
of
sky
is
visible
overhead
but
where
they
recede
a
little
the
meadows
at
their
foot
are
verdant
with
evergreen
shrubs
among
which
apollo
s
own
laurel
may
still
be
seen
in
antiquity
the
god
himself
stained
with
the
dragon
s
blood
is
said
to
have
come
a
haggard
footsore
wayfarer
to
this
wild
secluded
glen
and
there
plucked
branches
from
one
of
the
laurels
that
grew
in
its
green
thickets
beside
the
rippling
river
some
of
them
he
used
to
twine
a
wreath
for
his
brows
one
of
them
he
carried
in
his
hand
doubtless
in
order
that
guarded
by
the
sacred
plant
he
might
escape
the
hobgoblins
which
dogged
his
steps
so
the
boy
his
human
representative
did
the
same
and
brought
back
to
delphi
wreaths
of
laurel
from
the
same
tree
to
be
awarded
to
the
victors
in
the
pythian
games
hence
the
whole
festival
of
the
slaying
of
the
dragon
at
delphi
went
by
the
name
of
the
festival
of
crowning
from
this
it
appears
that
at
delphi
as
well
as
at
olympia
the
boughs
which
were
used
to
crown
the
victors
had
to
be
cut
from
a
sacred
tree
by
a
boy
whose
parents
must
be
both
alive
at
thebes
a
festival
called
the
was
held
once
in
every
eight
years
when
branches
of
laurel
were
carried
in
procession
to
the
temple
of
apollo
the
principal
part
in
the
procession
was
taken
by
a
boy
who
held
a
laurel
bough
and
bore
the
title
of
the
he
seems
to
have
personated
the
god
himself
his
hair
hung
down
on
his
shoulders
and
he
wore
a
golden
crown
a
robe
and
shoes
of
a
special
shape
both
his
parents
must
be
alive
we
may
suppose
that
the
golden
crown
which
he
wore
was
fashioned
in
the
shape
of
laurel
leaves
and
replaced
a
wreath
of
real
laurel
thus
the
boy
with
the
laurel
wreath
on
his
head
and
the
laurel
bough
in
his
hand
would
resemble
the
traditional
equipment
of
apollo
when
he
purified
himself
for
the
slaughter
of
the
dragon
we
may
conjecture
that
at
thebes
the
originally
personated
not
apollo
but
the
local
hero
cadmus
who
slew
the
dragon
and
had
like
apollo
to
purify
himself
for
the
slaughter
the
conjecture
is
confirmed
by
which
represent
cadmus
crowned
with
laurel
preparing
to
attack
the
dragon
or
actually
in
combat
with
the
monster
while
goddesses
bend
over
him
holding
out
wreaths
of
laurel
as
the
meed
of
victory
on
this
hypothesis
the
octennial
delphic
festival
of
crowning
and
the
octennial
theban
festival
of
were
closely
akin
in
both
the
prominent
part
played
by
the
laurel
was
purificatory
or
expiatory
thus
at
olympia
delphi
and
thebes
a
boy
whose
parents
were
both
alive
was
entrusted
with
the
duty
of
cutting
or
wearing
a
sacred
wreath
at
a
great
festival
which
recurred
at
intervals
of
several
years
why
a
boy
of
living
parents
should
be
chosen
for
such
an
office
is
not
at
first
sight
clear
the
reason
might
be
more
obvious
if
we
understood
the
ideas
in
which
the
custom
of
wearing
wreaths
and
crowns
had
its
origin
probably
in
many
cases
wreaths
and
crowns
were
amulets
before
they
were
ornaments
in
other
words
their
first
intention
may
have
been
not
so
much
to
adorn
the
head
as
to
protect
it
from
harm
by
surrounding
it
with
a
plant
a
metal
or
any
other
thing
which
was
supposed
to
possess
the
magical
virtue
of
banning
baleful
influences
thus
the
arabs
of
moab
will
put
a
circlet
of
copper
on
the
head
of
a
man
who
is
suffering
from
headache
for
they
believe
that
this
will
banish
the
pain
and
if
the
pain
is
in
an
arm
or
a
leg
they
will
treat
the
ailing
limb
in
like
manner
they
think
that
red
beads
hung
before
the
eyes
of
children
who
are
afflicted
with
ophthalmia
will
rid
them
of
the
malady
and
that
a
red
ribbon
tied
to
the
foot
will
prevent
it
from
stumbling
on
a
stony
path
again
the
melanesians
of
the
gazelle
peninsula
in
new
britain
often
deck
their
dusky
bodies
with
flowers
leaves
and
scented
herbs
not
only
at
festivals
but
on
other
occasions
which
to
the
european
might
seem
inappropriate
for
such
gay
ornaments
but
in
truth
the
bright
blossoms
and
verdant
foliage
are
not
intended
to
decorate
the
wearer
but
to
endow
him
with
certain
magical
virtues
which
are
supposed
to
inhere
in
the
flowers
and
leaves
thus
one
man
may
be
seen
strutting
about
with
a
wreath
of
greenery
which
passes
round
his
neck
and
droops
over
his
shoulders
back
and
breast
he
is
not
a
mere
dandy
but
a
lover
who
hopes
that
the
wreath
will
work
as
a
charm
on
a
woman
s
heart
again
another
may
be
observed
with
a
bunch
of
the
red
dracaena
leaves
knotted
round
his
neck
and
the
long
stalk
hanging
down
his
back
he
is
a
soldier
and
these
leaves
are
supposed
to
make
him
invulnerable
but
if
the
lover
should
fail
to
win
the
affections
of
his
swarthy
mistress
if
the
warrior
should
be
wounded
in
battle
it
never
occurs
to
either
of
them
to
question
the
magical
virtue
of
the
charm
they
ascribe
the
failure
either
to
the
more
potent
charm
of
another
magician
or
to
some
oversight
on
their
own
part
on
the
theory
that
wreaths
and
garlands
serve
as
amulets
to
protect
the
wearer
against
the
powers
of
evil
we
can
understand
not
only
why
in
antiquity
sacred
persons
such
as
priests
and
kings
wore
crowns
but
also
why
dead
bodies
sacrificial
victims
and
in
certain
circumstances
even
inanimate
objects
such
as
the
implements
of
sacrifice
the
doors
of
houses
and
so
forth
were
decorated
or
rather
guarded
by
wreaths
further
on
this
hypothesis
we
may
perhaps
perceive
why
children
of
living
parents
were
specially
chosen
to
cut
or
wear
sacred
wreaths
since
such
children
were
apparently
supposed
to
be
endowed
with
a
more
than
common
share
of
vital
energy
they
might
be
deemed
peculiarly
fitted
to
make
or
wear
amulets
which
were
designed
to
protect
the
wearer
from
injury
and
death
the
current
of
life
which
circulated
in
their
own
veins
overflowed
as
it
were
and
reinforced
the
magic
virtue
of
the
wreath
for
the
same
reason
such
children
would
naturally
be
chosen
to
personate
gods
as
they
seemingly
were
at
delphi
and
thebes
at
ephesus
if
we
may
trust
the
evidence
of
the
greek
heliodorus
a
boy
and
girl
of
living
parents
used
to
hold
for
a
year
the
priesthood
of
apollo
and
artemis
respectively
when
their
period
of
office
was
nearly
expired
they
led
a
sacred
embassy
to
delos
the
birthplace
of
the
divine
brother
and
sister
where
they
superintended
the
musical
and
athletic
contests
and
laid
down
the
priesthood
at
rome
no
girl
might
be
chosen
a
vestal
virgin
unless
both
her
father
and
mother
were
living
yet
there
is
no
evidence
or
probability
that
a
vestal
vacated
office
on
the
death
of
a
parent
indeed
she
generally
held
office
for
life
this
alone
may
suffice
to
prove
that
the
custom
of
entrusting
certain
sacred
duties
to
children
of
living
parents
was
not
based
on
any
notion
that
orphans
as
such
were
ceremonially
unclean
again
the
dancing
priests
of
mars
the
salii
must
be
sons
of
living
parents
but
as
in
the
case
of
the
vestals
this
condition
probably
only
applied
at
the
date
of
their
election
for
they
seem
like
the
vestals
to
have
held
office
for
life
at
all
events
we
read
of
a
lively
old
gentleman
who
still
skipped
and
capered
about
as
a
dancing
priest
with
an
agility
which
threw
the
efforts
of
his
younger
colleagues
into
the
shade
again
at
the
public
games
in
rome
boys
of
living
parents
had
to
escort
the
images
of
the
gods
in
their
sacred
cars
and
it
was
a
dire
omen
if
one
of
them
relaxed
his
hold
on
the
holy
cart
or
let
a
strap
slip
from
his
fingers
and
when
the
stout
roman
heart
was
shaken
by
the
appalling
news
that
somebody
had
been
struck
by
lightning
that
the
sky
had
somewhere
been
suddenly
overcast
or
that
a
had
been
safely
delivered
of
a
colt
boys
and
girls
whose
fathers
and
mothers
were
still
alive
used
to
be
sought
out
and
employed
to
help
in
expiating
the
terrific
prodigy
again
when
the
capitol
had
been
sacked
and
burned
by
the
disorderly
troops
of
vitellius
solemn
preparations
were
made
to
rebuild
it
the
whole
area
was
enclosed
by
a
cordon
of
fillets
and
wreaths
then
soldiers
chosen
for
their
auspicious
names
entered
within
the
barriers
holding
branches
of
lucky
trees
in
their
hands
and
afterwards
the
vestal
virgins
aided
by
boys
and
girls
of
living
parents
washed
the
foundations
with
water
drawn
from
springs
and
rivers
in
this
ceremony
the
choice
of
such
children
seems
to
be
based
on
the
same
idea
as
the
choice
of
such
water
for
as
running
water
is
deemed
to
be
especially
alive
so
the
vital
current
might
be
thought
to
flow
without
interruption
in
the
children
of
living
parents
but
to
stagnate
in
orphans
hence
the
children
of
living
parents
rather
than
orphans
would
naturally
be
chosen
to
pour
the
living
water
over
the
foundations
and
so
to
lend
something
of
their
own
vitality
or
endurance
to
a
building
that
was
designed
to
last
for
ever
on
the
same
principle
we
can
easily
understand
why
the
children
of
living
parents
should
be
especially
chosen
to
perform
certain
offices
at
marriage
the
motive
of
such
a
choice
may
be
a
wish
to
ensure
by
sympathetic
magic
the
life
of
the
newly
wedded
pair
and
of
their
offspring
thus
at
roman
marriages
the
bride
was
escorted
to
her
new
home
by
three
boys
whose
parents
were
all
living
two
of
the
boys
held
her
and
the
third
carried
a
torch
of
buckthorn
or
hawthorn
in
front
of
her
probably
for
the
purpose
of
averting
the
powers
of
evil
for
buckthorn
or
hawthorn
was
credited
with
this
magical
virtue
at
marriages
in
ancient
athens
a
boy
whose
parents
were
both
living
used
to
wear
a
wreath
of
thorns
and
acorns
and
to
carry
about
a
full
of
loaves
crying
i
have
escaped
the
bad
i
have
found
the
in
modern
greece
on
the
sunday
before
a
marriage
the
bridegroom
sends
to
the
bride
the
wedding
cake
by
the
hands
of
a
boy
both
of
whose
parents
must
be
living
the
messenger
takes
great
care
not
to
stumble
or
to
injure
the
cake
for
to
do
either
would
be
a
very
bad
omen
he
may
not
enter
the
bride
s
house
till
she
has
taken
the
cake
from
him
for
this
purpose
he
lays
it
down
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
and
then
both
of
them
the
boy
and
the
bride
rush
at
it
and
try
to
seize
the
greater
part
of
the
cake
and
when
cattle
are
being
slaughtered
for
the
marriage
festivities
the
first
beast
killed
for
the
bride
s
house
must
be
killed
by
a
youth
whose
parents
are
both
alive
further
a
son
of
living
parents
must
solemnly
fetch
the
water
with
which
the
bridegroom
s
head
is
ceremonially
washed
by
women
before
marriage
and
on
the
day
after
the
marriage
bride
and
bridegroom
go
in
procession
to
the
well
or
spring
from
which
they
are
henceforth
to
fetch
their
water
the
bride
greets
the
spring
drinks
of
the
water
from
the
hollow
of
her
hand
and
throws
money
and
food
into
it
then
follows
a
dance
accompanied
by
a
song
round
about
the
spring
lastly
a
lad
whose
parents
are
both
living
draws
water
from
the
spring
in
a
special
vessel
and
carries
it
to
the
house
of
the
bridal
pair
without
speaking
a
word
this
unspoken
water
as
it
is
called
is
regarded
as
peculiarly
holy
and
wholesome
when
the
young
couple
return
from
the
spring
they
fill
their
mouths
with
the
unspoken
water
and
try
to
spirt
it
on
each
other
inside
the
door
of
the
house
in
albania
when
women
are
baking
cakes
for
a
wedding
the
first
to
put
hand
to
the
dough
must
be
a
maiden
whose
parents
are
both
alive
and
who
has
brothers
the
more
the
better
for
only
such
a
girl
is
deemed
lucky
and
when
the
bride
has
dismounted
from
her
horse
at
the
bridegroom
s
door
a
small
boy
whose
parents
are
both
alive
for
only
such
a
boy
is
thought
to
bring
luck
is
passed
thrice
backwards
and
forwards
under
the
horse
s
belly
as
if
he
would
girdle
the
beast
among
the
south
slavs
of
bulgaria
a
little
child
whose
father
and
mother
are
both
alive
helps
to
bake
the
two
bridal
cakes
pouring
water
and
salt
on
the
meal
and
stirring
the
mixture
with
a
spurtle
of
a
special
shape
then
a
girl
lifts
the
child
in
her
arms
and
the
little
one
touches
the
thrice
with
the
spurtle
saying
boys
and
and
when
the
bride
s
hair
is
to
be
dressed
for
the
wedding
day
the
work
of
combing
and
plaiting
it
must
be
begun
by
a
child
of
living
parents
among
the
eesa
and
gadabursi
two
somali
tribes
on
the
morning
after
a
marriage
the
bride
s
female
relations
bring
presents
of
milk
and
are
accompanied
by
a
young
male
child
whose
parents
are
living
the
child
drinks
some
of
the
milk
before
any
one
else
tastes
it
and
after
him
the
bridegroom
if
his
parents
are
living
but
if
one
or
both
of
his
parents
are
dead
and
those
of
the
bride
living
she
drinks
after
the
child
by
doing
this
they
believe
that
if
the
woman
bears
a
child
the
father
will
be
alive
at
the
a
slightly
different
application
of
the
same
principle
appears
in
the
old
hindoo
rule
that
when
a
bride
reached
the
house
of
her
husband
she
should
be
made
to
descend
from
the
chariot
by
women
of
good
character
whose
husbands
and
sons
were
living
and
that
afterwards
these
women
should
seat
the
bride
on
a
bull
s
hide
while
her
husband
recited
the
verse
here
ye
cows
bring
forth
here
the
ceremony
of
seating
the
young
wife
on
a
bull
s
hide
seems
plainly
intended
to
make
her
fruitful
through
the
generative
virtue
of
the
bull
while
the
attendance
of
women
whose
husbands
and
sons
are
living
is
no
doubt
a
device
for
ensuring
by
sympathetic
magic
the
life
both
of
the
bride
s
husband
and
of
her
future
offspring
in
the
somali
custom
just
described
the
part
played
by
the
child
of
living
parents
is
unambiguous
and
helps
to
throw
light
on
the
obscurer
cases
which
precede
such
a
child
is
clearly
supposed
to
impart
the
virtue
of
longevity
to
the
milk
of
which
it
partakes
and
so
to
transmit
it
to
the
newly
married
pair
who
afterwards
drink
of
the
milk
similarly
we
may
suppose
that
in
all
marriage
rites
at
least
if
not
in
religious
rites
generally
the
employment
of
children
of
living
parents
is
intended
to
diffuse
by
sympathy
the
blessings
of
life
and
longevity
among
all
who
participate
in
the
ceremonies
this
intention
seems
to
underlie
the
use
which
the
malagasy
make
of
the
children
of
living
parents
in
ritual
thus
when
a
child
is
a
week
old
it
is
dressed
up
in
the
finest
clothes
that
can
be
got
and
is
then
carried
out
of
the
house
by
some
person
whose
parents
are
both
still
living
afterwards
it
is
brought
back
to
the
mother
in
the
act
of
being
carried
out
and
in
the
infant
must
be
twice
carefully
lifted
over
the
fire
which
is
placed
near
the
door
if
the
child
is
a
boy
the
axe
knife
and
spear
of
the
family
together
with
any
building
tools
that
may
be
in
the
house
are
taken
out
of
it
at
the
same
time
the
implements
are
perhaps
used
chiefly
as
emblems
of
the
occupations
in
which
it
is
expected
the
infant
will
engage
when
it
arrives
at
maturer
years
and
the
whole
may
be
regarded
as
expressing
the
hopes
cherished
of
his
activity
wealth
and
on
such
an
occasion
the
service
of
a
person
whose
parents
are
both
alive
seems
naturally
calculated
to
promote
the
longevity
of
the
infant
for
a
like
reason
probably
the
holy
water
used
at
the
malagasy
ceremony
of
circumcision
is
drawn
from
a
pool
by
a
person
whose
parents
are
both
still
living
the
same
idea
may
explain
a
funeral
custom
observed
by
the
sihanaka
of
madagascar
after
a
burial
the
family
of
the
deceased
with
their
near
relatives
and
dependents
meet
in
the
house
from
which
the
corpse
was
lately
removed
to
drink
rum
and
to
undergo
a
purifying
and
preserving
baptism
called
leaves
of
the
lemon
or
lime
tree
and
the
stalks
of
two
kinds
of
grass
are
gathered
and
placed
in
a
vessel
with
water
a
person
both
of
whose
parents
are
living
is
chosen
to
perform
the
rite
and
this
holy
water
is
then
sprinkled
upon
the
walls
of
the
house
and
upon
all
assembled
within
them
and
finally
around
the
house
here
a
person
whose
parents
are
both
living
appears
to
be
credited
with
a
more
than
common
share
of
life
and
longevity
from
which
it
naturally
follows
that
he
is
better
fitted
than
any
one
else
to
perform
a
ceremony
intended
to
avert
the
danger
of
death
from
the
household
the
notion
that
a
child
of
living
parents
is
endowed
with
a
higher
degree
of
vitality
than
an
orphan
probably
explains
all
the
cases
of
the
employment
of
such
a
child
in
ritual
whether
the
particular
rite
is
designed
to
ensure
the
fertility
of
the
ground
or
the
fruitfulness
of
women
or
to
avert
the
danger
of
death
and
other
calamities
yet
it
might
be
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
this
notion
is
always
clearly
apprehended
by
the
persons
who
practise
the
customs
in
their
minds
the
definite
conception
of
superabundant
and
overflowing
vitality
may
easily
dissolve
into
a
vague
idea
that
the
child
of
living
parents
is
luckier
than
other
folk
no
more
than
this
seems
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
masai
rule
that
when
the
warriors
wish
to
select
a
chief
they
must
choose
a
man
whose
parents
are
still
living
who
owns
cattle
and
has
never
killed
anybody
whose
parents
are
not
blind
and
who
himself
has
not
a
discoloured
and
nothing
more
is
needed
to
explain
the
ancient
greek
custom
which
assigned
the
duty
of
drawing
lots
from
an
urn
to
a
boy
under
puberty
whose
father
and
mother
were
both
in
life
at
athens
it
would
appear
that
registers
of
these
boys
were
kept
perhaps
in
order
that
the
lads
might
discharge
as
occasion
arose
those
offices
of
religion
which
required
the
service
of
such
auspicious
youths
the
atrocious
tyrant
heliogabalus
one
of
the
worst
monsters
who
ever
disgraced
the
human
form
caused
search
to
be
made
throughout
italy
for
noble
and
handsome
boys
whose
parents
were
both
alive
and
he
sacrificed
them
to
his
barbarous
gods
torturing
them
first
and
grabbling
among
their
entrails
afterwards
for
omens
he
seems
to
have
thought
that
such
victims
would
be
peculiarly
acceptable
to
the
syrian
deities
whom
he
worshipped
so
he
encouraged
the
torturers
and
butchers
at
their
work
and
thanked
the
gods
for
enabling
him
to
ferret
out
their
iii
a
charm
to
protect
a
town
the
tradition
that
a
lydian
king
tried
to
make
the
citadel
of
sardes
impregnable
by
carrying
round
it
a
lion
may
perhaps
be
illustrated
by
a
south
african
custom
when
the
bechuanas
are
about
to
found
a
new
town
they
observe
an
elaborate
ritual
they
choose
a
bull
from
the
herd
sew
up
its
eyelids
with
sinew
and
then
allow
the
blinded
animal
to
wander
at
will
for
four
days
on
the
fifth
day
they
track
it
down
and
sacrifice
it
at
sunset
on
the
spot
where
it
happens
to
be
standing
the
carcase
is
then
roasted
whole
and
divided
among
the
people
ritual
requires
that
every
particle
of
the
flesh
should
be
consumed
on
the
spot
when
the
sacrificial
meal
is
over
the
take
the
hide
and
mark
it
with
appropriate
medicines
the
composition
of
which
is
a
professional
secret
then
with
one
long
spiral
cut
they
convert
the
whole
hide
into
a
single
thong
having
done
so
they
cut
up
the
thong
into
lengths
of
about
two
feet
and
despatch
messengers
in
all
directions
to
peg
down
one
of
those
strips
in
each
of
the
paths
leading
to
the
new
town
after
this
it
is
said
if
a
foreigner
approaches
the
new
town
to
destroy
it
with
his
charms
he
will
find
that
the
town
has
prepared
itself
for
his
thus
it
would
seem
that
the
pastoral
bechuanas
attempt
to
place
a
new
town
under
the
protection
of
one
of
their
sacred
cattle
by
distributing
pieces
of
its
hide
at
all
points
where
an
enemy
could
approach
it
just
as
the
lydian
king
thought
to
place
the
citadel
of
his
capital
under
the
protection
of
the
by
carrying
the
animal
round
the
boundaries
further
the
bechuana
custom
may
throw
light
on
a
widespread
legend
which
relates
how
a
wily
settler
in
a
new
country
bought
from
the
natives
as
much
land
as
could
be
covered
with
a
hide
and
how
he
then
proceeded
to
cut
the
hide
into
thongs
and
to
claim
as
much
land
as
could
be
enclosed
by
the
thongs
it
was
thus
according
to
the
hottentots
that
the
first
european
settlers
obtained
a
footing
in
south
africa
but
the
most
familiar
example
of
such
stories
is
the
tradition
that
dido
procured
the
site
of
carthage
in
this
fashion
and
that
the
place
hence
received
the
name
of
byrsa
or
similar
tales
occur
in
the
legendary
history
of
saxons
and
danes
and
they
meet
us
in
india
siberia
burma
cambodia
java
and
bali
the
wide
diffusion
of
such
stories
confirms
the
conjecture
of
jacob
grimm
that
in
them
we
have
a
reminiscence
of
a
mode
of
land
measurement
which
was
once
actually
in
use
and
of
which
the
designation
is
still
retained
in
the
english
the
bechuana
custom
suggests
that
the
mode
of
measuring
by
a
hide
may
have
originated
in
a
practice
of
encompassing
a
piece
of
land
with
thongs
cut
from
the
hide
of
a
sacrificial
victim
in
order
to
place
the
ground
under
the
guardianship
of
the
sacred
animal
but
why
do
the
bechuanas
sew
up
the
eyelids
of
the
bull
which
is
to
be
used
for
this
purpose
the
answer
appears
to
be
given
by
the
ceremonies
which
the
same
people
observe
when
they
are
going
out
to
war
on
that
occasion
a
woman
rushes
up
to
the
army
with
her
eyes
shut
and
shakes
a
while
she
cries
out
the
army
is
not
seen
the
army
is
not
seen
and
a
at
the
same
time
sprinkles
medicine
over
the
spears
crying
out
in
like
manner
the
army
is
not
seen
the
army
is
not
seen
after
that
they
seize
a
bull
sew
up
its
eyelids
with
a
hair
of
its
tail
and
drive
it
for
some
distance
along
the
road
which
the
army
is
to
take
when
it
has
preceded
the
army
a
little
way
the
bull
is
sacrificed
roasted
whole
and
eaten
by
the
warriors
all
the
flesh
must
be
consumed
on
the
spot
such
parts
as
can
not
be
eaten
are
burnt
with
fire
only
the
contents
of
the
stomach
are
carefully
preserved
as
a
charm
which
is
to
lead
the
warriors
to
victory
chosen
men
carry
the
precious
guts
in
front
of
the
army
and
it
is
deemed
most
important
that
no
one
should
precede
them
when
they
stop
the
army
stops
and
it
will
not
resume
the
march
till
it
sees
that
the
men
with
the
bull
s
guts
have
gone
forward
the
meaning
of
these
ceremonies
is
explained
by
the
cries
of
the
woman
and
the
priest
the
army
is
not
seen
the
army
is
not
seen
clearly
it
is
desirable
that
the
army
should
not
be
perceived
by
the
enemies
until
it
is
upon
them
accordingly
on
the
principles
of
homoeopathic
magic
the
bechuanas
apparently
imagine
that
they
can
make
themselves
invisible
by
eating
of
the
flesh
of
a
blind
bull
blindness
and
invisibility
being
to
their
simple
minds
the
same
thing
for
the
same
reason
the
bowels
of
the
blind
ox
are
carried
in
front
of
the
army
to
hide
its
advance
from
hostile
eyes
in
like
manner
the
custom
of
sacrificing
and
eating
a
blind
ox
on
the
place
where
a
new
town
is
to
be
built
may
be
intended
to
render
the
town
invisible
to
enemies
at
all
events
the
bawenda
a
south
african
people
who
belong
to
the
same
bantu
stock
as
the
bechuanas
take
great
pains
to
conceal
their
kraals
from
the
kraals
are
built
in
the
forest
or
bush
and
the
long
winding
footpaths
which
lead
to
them
are
often
kept
open
only
by
the
support
of
a
single
pole
here
and
there
indeed
the
paths
are
so
low
and
narrow
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
bring
a
horse
into
such
a
village
in
time
of
war
the
poles
are
removed
and
the
thorny
creepers
fall
down
forming
a
natural
screen
or
bulwark
which
the
enemy
can
neither
penetrate
nor
destroy
by
fire
the
kraals
are
also
surrounded
by
walls
of
undressed
stones
with
a
filling
of
soil
and
to
hide
them
still
better
from
the
view
of
the
enemy
the
tops
of
the
walls
are
sown
with
indian
corn
or
planted
with
tobacco
hence
travellers
passing
through
the
country
seldom
come
across
a
bawenda
kraal
to
see
where
the
bawenda
dwell
you
must
climb
to
the
tops
of
mountains
and
look
down
on
the
roofs
of
their
round
huts
peeping
out
of
the
surrounding
green
like
clusters
of
mushrooms
in
the
woods
the
object
which
the
bawenda
attain
by
these
perfectly
rational
means
the
bechuanas
seek
to
compass
by
the
sacrifice
and
consumption
of
a
blind
bull
this
explanation
of
the
use
of
a
blinded
ox
in
sacrifice
is
confirmed
by
the
reasons
alleged
by
a
caffre
for
the
observance
of
a
somewhat
similar
custom
in
purificatory
ceremonies
after
a
battle
on
these
occasions
the
bechuanas
and
other
caffre
tribes
of
south
africa
kill
a
black
ox
and
cut
out
the
tip
of
its
tongue
an
eye
a
piece
of
the
and
a
piece
of
the
principal
sinew
of
the
shoulder
these
parts
are
fried
with
certain
herbs
and
rubbed
into
the
joints
of
the
warriors
by
cutting
out
the
tongue
of
the
ox
they
think
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
wagging
his
tongue
against
them
by
severing
the
sinews
of
the
ox
they
hope
to
cause
the
enemy
s
sinews
to
fail
him
in
the
battle
and
by
removing
the
eye
of
the
ox
they
imagine
that
they
prevent
the
enemy
from
casting
a
covetous
eye
on
their
cattle
iv
some
customs
of
the
pelew
islanders
we
have
seen
that
the
state
of
society
and
religion
among
the
pelew
islanders
in
modern
times
presents
several
points
of
similarity
to
the
condition
of
the
peoples
about
the
eastern
mediterranean
in
antiquity
here
i
propose
briefly
to
call
attention
to
certain
other
customs
of
the
pelew
islanders
which
may
serve
to
illustrate
some
of
the
institutions
discussed
in
this
volume
priests
dressed
as
women
in
the
pelew
islands
it
often
happens
that
a
goddess
chooses
a
man
not
a
woman
for
her
minister
and
inspired
mouthpiece
when
that
is
so
the
favoured
man
is
thenceforth
regarded
and
treated
as
a
woman
he
wears
female
attire
he
carries
a
piece
of
gold
on
his
neck
he
labours
like
a
woman
in
the
taro
fields
and
he
plays
his
new
part
so
well
that
he
earns
the
hearty
contempt
of
his
fellows
the
pretended
change
of
sex
under
the
inspiration
of
a
female
spirit
perhaps
explains
a
custom
widely
spread
among
savages
in
accordance
with
which
some
men
dress
as
women
and
act
as
women
through
life
these
unsexed
creatures
often
perhaps
generally
profess
the
arts
of
sorcery
and
healing
they
communicate
with
spirits
and
are
regarded
sometimes
with
awe
and
sometimes
with
contempt
as
beings
of
a
higher
or
lower
order
than
common
folk
often
they
are
dedicated
and
trained
to
their
vocation
from
childhood
effeminate
sorcerers
or
priests
of
this
sort
are
found
among
the
sea
dyaks
of
borneo
the
bugis
of
south
celebes
the
patagonians
of
south
america
and
the
aleutians
and
many
indian
tribes
of
north
america
in
the
island
of
rambree
off
the
coast
of
aracan
a
set
of
vagabond
conjurors
who
dressed
and
lived
as
women
used
to
dance
round
a
tall
pole
invoking
the
aid
of
their
favourite
idol
on
the
occasion
of
any
calamity
male
members
of
the
vallabha
sect
in
india
often
seek
to
win
the
favour
of
the
god
krishna
whom
they
specially
revere
by
wearing
their
hair
long
and
assimilating
themselves
to
women
even
their
spiritual
chiefs
the
maharajas
sometimes
simulate
the
appearance
of
women
when
they
lead
the
worship
of
their
followers
in
madagascar
we
hear
of
effeminate
men
who
wore
female
attire
and
acted
as
women
thinking
thereby
to
do
god
service
in
the
kingdom
of
congo
there
was
a
sacrificial
priest
who
commonly
dressed
as
a
woman
and
gloried
in
the
title
of
the
grandmother
the
post
of
grandmother
must
have
been
much
coveted
for
the
incumbent
might
not
be
put
to
death
whatever
crimes
or
rascalities
he
committed
and
to
do
him
justice
he
appears
commonly
to
have
taken
full
advantage
of
this
benefit
of
clergy
when
he
died
his
fortunate
successor
dissected
the
body
of
the
deceased
grandmother
extracting
his
heart
and
other
vital
organs
and
amputating
his
fingers
and
toes
which
he
kept
as
priceless
relics
and
sold
as
sovereign
remedies
for
all
the
ills
that
flesh
is
heir
to
we
may
conjecture
that
in
many
of
these
cases
the
call
to
this
strange
form
of
the
religious
life
came
in
the
shape
of
a
dream
or
vision
in
which
the
dreamer
or
visionary
imagined
himself
to
be
a
woman
or
to
be
possessed
by
a
female
spirit
for
with
many
savage
races
the
disordered
fancies
of
sleep
or
ecstasy
are
accepted
as
oracular
admonitions
which
it
would
be
perilous
to
disregard
at
all
events
we
are
told
that
a
dream
or
a
revelation
of
some
sort
was
the
reason
which
in
north
america
these
commonly
alleged
for
the
life
they
led
it
had
been
thus
brought
home
to
them
they
said
that
their
medicine
or
their
salvation
lay
in
living
as
women
and
when
once
they
had
got
this
notion
into
their
head
nothing
could
drive
it
out
again
many
an
indian
father
attempted
by
persuasion
by
bribes
by
violence
to
deter
his
son
from
obeying
the
mysterious
call
but
all
to
no
purpose
among
the
sauks
an
indian
tribe
of
north
america
these
effeminate
beings
were
always
despised
but
sometimes
they
were
pitied
as
labouring
under
an
unfortunate
destiny
which
they
can
not
avoid
being
supposed
to
be
impelled
to
this
course
by
a
vision
from
the
female
spirit
that
resides
in
the
similarly
the
omahas
another
indian
tribe
of
north
america
believe
that
the
unfortunate
beings
called
are
mysterious
or
sacred
because
they
have
been
affected
by
the
moon
being
when
a
young
omaha
fasted
for
the
first
time
on
reaching
puberty
it
was
thought
that
the
moon
being
appeared
to
him
holding
in
one
hand
a
bow
and
arrows
and
in
the
other
a
pack
strap
such
as
the
indian
women
use
when
the
youth
tried
to
grasp
the
bow
and
arrows
the
moon
being
crossed
his
hands
very
quickly
and
if
the
youth
was
not
very
careful
he
seized
the
pack
strap
instead
of
the
bow
and
arrows
thereby
fixing
his
lot
in
after
life
in
such
a
case
he
could
not
help
acting
the
woman
speaking
dressing
and
working
just
as
indian
women
used
to
among
the
ibans
or
sea
dyaks
of
borneo
the
highest
class
of
sorcerers
or
are
those
who
are
believed
to
have
been
transformed
into
women
such
a
man
is
therefore
called
a
changed
on
account
of
his
supposed
change
of
sex
the
call
to
transform
himself
into
a
woman
is
said
to
come
as
a
supernatural
command
thrice
repeated
in
dreams
to
disregard
the
command
would
mean
death
accordingly
he
makes
a
feast
sacrifices
a
pig
or
two
to
avert
evil
consequences
from
the
tribe
and
then
assumes
the
garb
of
a
woman
thenceforth
he
is
treated
as
a
woman
and
occupies
himself
in
feminine
pursuits
his
chief
aim
is
to
copy
female
manners
and
habits
as
accurately
as
possible
he
is
employed
for
the
same
purposes
as
an
ordinary
and
his
methods
are
similar
but
he
is
paid
much
higher
fees
and
is
often
called
in
when
others
have
been
unable
to
effect
a
cure
similarly
among
the
chukchees
of
asia
there
are
shamans
or
who
assimilate
themselves
as
far
as
possible
to
women
and
who
are
believed
to
be
called
to
this
vocation
by
spirits
in
a
dream
the
call
usually
comes
at
the
critical
age
of
early
youth
when
the
shamanistic
inspiration
as
it
is
called
first
manifests
itself
but
the
call
is
much
dreaded
by
the
youthful
adepts
and
some
of
them
prefer
death
to
obedience
there
are
however
various
stages
or
degrees
of
transformation
in
the
first
stage
the
man
apes
a
woman
only
in
the
manner
of
braiding
and
arranging
the
hair
of
his
head
in
the
second
he
dons
female
attire
in
the
third
stage
he
adopts
as
far
as
possible
the
life
and
characteristics
of
the
female
sex
a
young
man
who
is
undergoing
this
final
transformation
abandons
all
masculine
occupations
and
manners
he
throws
away
the
rifle
and
the
lance
the
lasso
of
the
reindeer
herdsman
and
the
harpoon
of
the
and
betakes
himself
to
the
needle
and
the
instead
he
learns
the
use
of
them
quickly
because
the
spirits
are
helping
him
all
the
time
even
his
pronunciation
changes
from
the
male
to
the
female
mode
at
the
same
time
his
body
alters
if
not
in
outward
appearance
at
least
in
its
faculties
and
forces
he
loses
masculine
strength
fleetness
of
foot
endurance
in
wrestling
and
falls
into
the
debility
and
helplessness
of
a
woman
even
his
mental
character
undergoes
a
change
his
old
brute
courage
and
fighting
spirit
are
gone
he
grows
shy
and
bashful
before
strangers
fond
of
small
talk
and
of
dandling
little
children
in
short
he
becomes
a
woman
with
the
appearance
of
a
man
and
as
a
woman
he
is
often
taken
to
wife
by
another
man
with
whom
he
leads
a
regular
married
life
extraordinary
powers
are
attributed
to
such
transformed
shamans
they
are
supposed
to
enjoy
the
special
protection
of
spirits
who
play
the
part
of
supernatural
husbands
to
them
hence
they
are
much
dreaded
even
by
their
colleagues
in
the
profession
who
remain
mere
men
hence
too
they
excel
in
all
branches
of
magic
including
ventriloquism
among
the
teso
of
central
africa
often
dress
as
women
and
wear
feminine
ornaments
such
as
heavy
chains
of
beads
and
shells
round
their
heads
and
necks
and
just
as
a
man
inspired
by
a
goddess
may
adopt
female
attire
so
conversely
a
woman
inspired
by
a
god
may
adopt
male
costume
in
uganda
the
great
god
mukasa
the
deity
of
the
victoria
nyanza
lake
and
of
abundance
imparted
his
oracles
through
a
woman
who
in
ordinary
life
dressed
like
the
rest
of
her
sex
in
a
bark
cloth
wrapped
round
the
body
and
fastened
with
a
girdle
so
as
to
leave
the
arms
and
shoulders
bare
but
when
she
prophesied
under
the
inspiration
of
the
god
she
wore
two
bark
cloths
knotted
in
masculine
style
over
her
shoulders
and
crossing
each
other
on
her
breast
and
back
when
once
the
god
had
chosen
her
she
retained
office
for
life
she
might
not
marry
or
converse
with
any
man
except
one
particular
priest
who
was
always
present
when
she
was
possessed
by
the
deity
perhaps
this
assumed
change
of
sex
under
the
inspiration
of
a
goddess
may
give
the
key
to
the
legends
of
the
effeminate
sardanapalus
and
the
effeminate
hercules
as
well
as
to
the
practice
of
the
effeminate
priests
of
cybele
and
the
syrian
goddess
in
all
such
cases
the
pretended
transformation
of
a
man
into
a
woman
would
be
intelligible
if
we
supposed
that
the
womanish
priest
or
king
thought
himself
animated
by
a
female
spirit
whose
sex
accordingly
he
felt
bound
to
imitate
certainly
the
eunuch
priests
of
cybele
seem
to
have
bereft
themselves
of
their
manhood
under
the
supposed
inspiration
of
the
great
goddess
the
priest
of
hercules
at
antimachia
in
cos
who
dressed
as
a
woman
when
he
offered
sacrifice
is
said
to
have
done
so
in
imitation
of
hercules
who
disguised
himself
as
a
woman
to
escape
the
pursuit
of
his
enemies
so
the
lydian
hercules
wore
female
attire
when
he
served
for
three
years
as
the
purchased
slave
of
the
imperious
omphale
queen
of
lydia
if
we
suppose
that
queen
omphale
like
queen
semiramis
was
nothing
but
the
great
asiatic
goddess
or
one
of
her
avatars
it
becomes
probable
that
the
story
of
the
womanish
hercules
of
lydia
preserves
a
reminiscence
of
a
line
or
college
of
effeminate
priests
who
like
the
eunuch
priests
of
the
syrian
goddess
dressed
as
women
in
imitation
of
their
goddess
and
were
supposed
to
be
inspired
by
her
the
probability
is
increased
by
the
practice
of
the
priests
of
hercules
at
antimachia
in
cos
who
as
we
have
just
seen
actually
wore
female
attire
when
they
were
engaged
in
their
sacred
duties
similarly
at
the
vernal
mysteries
of
hercules
in
rome
the
men
were
draped
in
the
garments
of
women
and
in
some
of
the
rites
and
processions
of
dionysus
also
men
wore
female
attire
in
legend
and
art
there
are
clear
traces
of
an
effeminate
dionysus
who
perhaps
figured
in
a
strange
ceremony
for
the
artificial
fertilization
of
the
fig
among
the
nahanarvals
an
ancient
german
tribe
a
priest
garbed
as
a
woman
presided
over
a
sacred
grove
these
and
similar
practices
need
not
necessarily
have
any
connexion
with
the
social
system
of
wherever
a
goddess
is
revered
and
the
theory
of
inspiration
is
held
a
man
may
be
thought
to
be
possessed
by
a
female
spirit
whether
society
be
organized
on
or
on
still
the
chances
of
such
a
transformation
of
sex
will
be
greater
under
than
under
if
as
we
have
found
reason
to
believe
a
system
of
is
more
favourable
to
the
development
and
multiplication
of
goddesses
than
of
gods
it
is
therefore
perhaps
no
mere
accident
that
we
meet
with
these
effeminate
priests
in
regions
like
the
pelew
islands
and
western
asia
where
the
system
of
either
actually
prevails
or
has
at
least
left
traces
of
it
behind
in
tradition
and
custom
such
traces
for
example
are
to
be
found
in
lydia
and
cos
in
both
of
which
the
effeminate
hercules
had
his
home
but
the
religious
or
superstitious
interchange
of
dress
between
men
and
women
is
an
obscure
and
complex
problem
and
it
is
unlikely
that
any
single
solution
would
apply
to
all
the
cases
probably
the
custom
has
been
practised
from
many
different
motives
for
example
the
practice
of
dressing
boys
as
girls
has
certainly
been
sometimes
adopted
to
avert
the
evil
eye
and
it
is
possible
that
the
custom
of
changing
garments
at
marriage
the
bridegroom
disguising
himself
as
a
woman
or
the
bride
disguising
herself
as
a
man
may
have
been
resorted
to
for
the
same
purpose
thus
in
cos
where
the
priest
of
hercules
wore
female
attire
the
bridegroom
was
in
like
manner
dressed
as
a
woman
when
he
received
his
bride
spartan
brides
had
their
hair
shaved
and
were
clad
in
men
s
clothes
and
booted
on
their
wedding
night
argive
brides
wore
false
beards
when
they
slept
with
their
husbands
for
the
first
time
in
southern
celebes
a
bridegroom
at
a
certain
point
of
the
long
and
elaborate
marriage
ceremonies
puts
on
the
garments
which
his
bride
has
just
put
off
among
the
jews
of
egypt
in
the
middle
ages
the
bride
led
the
wedding
dance
with
a
helmet
on
her
head
and
a
sword
in
her
hand
while
the
bridegroom
adorned
himself
as
a
woman
and
put
on
female
attire
at
a
brahman
marriage
in
southern
india
the
bride
is
dressed
up
as
a
boy
and
another
girl
is
dressed
up
to
represent
the
bride
they
are
taken
in
procession
through
the
street
and
on
returning
the
is
made
to
speak
to
the
real
bridegroom
in
somewhat
insolent
tones
and
some
mock
play
is
indulged
in
the
real
bridegroom
is
addressed
as
if
he
was
the
syce
groom
or
gumasta
clerk
of
the
and
is
sometimes
treated
as
a
thief
and
judgment
passed
on
him
by
the
among
the
bharias
of
the
central
provinces
of
india
the
bridegroom
puts
on
women
s
ornaments
and
carries
with
him
an
iron
or
dagger
to
keep
off
evil
similarly
among
the
khangars
a
low
hindustani
caste
of
the
same
region
the
bridegroom
is
dressed
in
a
yellow
gown
and
overcloth
with
trousers
of
red
chintz
red
shoes
and
a
marriage
crown
of
leaves
he
has
the
silver
ornaments
usually
worn
by
women
on
his
neck
as
the
or
silver
ring
and
the
or
necklace
of
rupees
in
order
to
avert
the
evil
eye
he
carries
a
dagger
or
and
a
smudge
of
lampblack
is
made
on
his
forehead
to
disfigure
him
and
thus
avert
the
evil
eye
which
it
is
thought
would
otherwise
be
too
probably
attracted
by
his
exquisitely
beautiful
appearance
in
his
wedding
these
examples
render
it
highly
probable
that
like
the
dagger
or
which
he
holds
in
his
hand
the
woman
s
ornaments
which
he
wears
are
intended
to
protect
the
bridegroom
against
demons
or
the
evil
eye
at
this
critical
moment
of
his
life
the
protection
apparently
consisting
in
a
disguise
which
enables
him
to
elude
the
unwelcome
attentions
of
malignant
beings
a
similar
explanation
probably
accounts
for
the
similar
exchange
of
costume
between
other
persons
than
the
bride
and
bridegroom
at
marriage
for
example
after
a
bharia
wedding
the
girl
s
mother
gets
the
dress
of
the
boy
s
father
and
puts
it
on
together
with
a
false
beard
and
moustaches
and
dances
holding
a
wooden
ladle
in
one
hand
and
a
packet
of
ashes
in
the
other
every
time
she
approaches
the
bridegroom
s
father
on
her
rounds
she
spills
some
of
the
ashes
over
him
and
occasionally
gives
him
a
crack
on
the
head
with
her
ladle
these
actions
being
accompanied
by
bursts
of
laughter
from
the
party
and
frenzied
playing
by
the
musicians
when
the
party
reach
the
bridegroom
s
house
on
their
return
his
mother
and
the
other
women
come
out
and
burn
a
little
mustard
and
human
hair
in
a
lamp
the
unpleasant
smell
emitted
by
these
articles
being
considered
potent
to
drive
away
evil
again
after
a
khangar
wedding
the
father
of
the
bridegroom
dressed
in
women
s
clothes
dances
with
the
mother
of
the
bride
while
the
two
throw
turmeric
mixed
with
water
on
each
other
similarly
after
a
wedding
of
the
bharbhunjas
another
hindustani
caste
of
the
central
provinces
the
bridegroom
s
father
dances
before
the
family
in
women
s
clothes
which
have
been
supplied
by
the
bride
s
father
such
disguises
and
dances
may
be
intended
either
to
protect
the
disguised
dancer
himself
against
the
evil
eye
or
perhaps
rather
to
guard
the
principal
personages
of
the
ceremony
the
bride
and
bridegroom
by
diverting
the
attention
of
demons
from
them
to
the
guiser
however
when
at
marriage
the
bride
alone
assumes
the
costume
and
appearance
of
the
other
sex
the
motive
for
the
disguise
may
perhaps
be
a
notion
that
on
the
principle
of
homoeopathic
magic
she
thereby
ensures
the
birth
of
a
male
heir
similarly
in
sweden
there
is
a
popular
superstition
that
on
the
night
preceding
her
nuptials
the
bride
should
have
a
to
sleep
with
her
in
which
case
her
will
be
a
son
and
among
the
kabyles
when
a
bride
dismounts
from
her
mule
at
her
husband
s
house
a
young
lad
leaps
into
the
saddle
before
she
touches
the
ground
in
order
that
her
first
child
may
be
a
boy
be
that
as
it
may
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
assumption
of
woman
s
dress
is
sometimes
intended
to
disguise
a
man
for
the
purpose
of
deceiving
a
demon
thus
among
the
boloki
or
bangala
on
the
upper
congo
a
man
was
long
afflicted
with
an
internal
malady
when
all
other
remedies
had
failed
a
informed
the
sufferer
that
the
cause
of
his
trouble
was
an
evil
spirit
and
that
the
best
thing
he
could
do
was
to
go
far
away
where
the
devil
could
not
get
at
him
and
to
remain
there
till
he
had
recovered
his
health
the
patient
followed
the
prescription
at
dead
of
night
he
left
his
house
taking
only
two
of
his
wives
with
him
and
telling
no
one
of
his
destination
lest
the
demon
should
hear
it
and
follow
him
so
he
went
far
away
from
his
town
donned
a
woman
s
dress
and
speaking
in
a
woman
s
voice
he
pretended
to
be
other
than
he
was
in
order
that
the
devil
should
not
be
able
to
find
him
at
his
new
address
strange
to
say
these
sage
measures
failed
to
effect
a
cure
and
wearying
of
exile
he
at
last
returned
home
where
he
continued
to
dress
and
speak
as
a
woman
again
the
of
assam
believe
that
if
a
man
kills
an
enemy
or
a
wild
beast
the
ghost
of
the
dead
man
or
animal
will
haunt
him
and
drive
him
mad
the
only
way
of
averting
this
catastrophe
is
to
dress
up
as
a
woman
and
pretend
to
be
one
for
example
a
man
who
had
shot
a
tiger
and
was
in
fear
of
being
haunted
by
the
animal
s
ghost
dressed
himself
up
in
a
woman
s
petticoat
and
cloth
wore
ivory
earrings
and
wound
a
mottled
cloth
round
his
head
like
a
turban
then
smoking
a
woman
s
pipe
carrying
a
little
basket
and
spinning
a
cotton
spindle
he
paraded
the
village
followed
by
a
crowd
roaring
and
shrieking
with
laughter
while
he
preserved
the
gravity
of
a
judge
for
a
single
smile
would
have
been
fatal
to
guard
against
the
possibility
of
unseasonable
mirth
he
carried
a
porcupine
in
his
arms
and
if
ever
tickled
beyond
the
pitch
of
endurance
he
burst
into
a
guffaw
the
crowd
said
it
was
the
porcupine
that
all
this
was
done
to
mortify
the
pride
of
the
tiger
s
ghost
by
leading
him
to
believe
that
he
had
been
shot
by
a
woman
the
same
dread
of
attracting
the
attention
of
dangerous
spirits
at
critical
times
perhaps
explains
the
custom
observed
by
some
east
african
tribes
of
wearing
the
costume
of
the
opposite
sex
at
circumcision
thus
when
masai
boys
have
been
circumcised
they
dress
as
women
wearing
earrings
in
their
ears
and
long
garments
that
reach
to
the
ground
they
also
whiten
their
swarthy
faces
with
chalk
this
costume
they
retain
till
their
wounds
are
healed
whereupon
they
are
shaved
and
assume
the
skins
and
ornaments
of
warriors
among
the
nandi
a
tribe
of
british
east
africa
before
boys
are
circumcised
they
receive
a
visit
from
young
girls
who
give
them
some
of
their
own
garments
and
ornaments
these
the
boys
put
on
and
wear
till
the
operation
of
circumcision
is
over
when
they
exchange
the
girls
clothes
for
the
garments
of
women
which
together
with
necklaces
are
provided
for
them
by
their
mothers
and
these
women
s
garments
the
newly
circumcised
lads
must
continue
to
wear
for
months
afterwards
girls
are
also
circumcised
among
the
nandi
and
before
they
submit
to
the
operation
they
attire
themselves
in
men
s
garments
and
carry
clubs
in
their
hands
if
such
interchange
of
costume
between
men
and
women
is
intended
to
disguise
the
wearers
against
demons
we
may
compare
the
practice
of
the
lycian
men
who
regularly
wore
women
s
dress
in
mourning
for
this
might
be
intended
to
conceal
them
from
the
ghost
just
as
perhaps
for
a
similar
reason
some
peoples
of
antiquity
used
to
descend
into
pits
and
remain
there
for
several
days
shunning
the
light
of
the
sun
whenever
a
death
had
taken
place
in
the
family
a
similar
desire
to
deceive
spirits
may
perhaps
explain
a
device
to
which
the
loeboes
a
primitive
tribe
of
sumatra
resort
when
they
wish
to
obtain
male
or
female
offspring
if
parents
have
several
sons
and
desire
that
the
next
child
shall
be
a
girl
they
dress
the
boys
as
girls
cut
their
hair
after
the
girlish
fashion
and
hang
necklaces
round
their
necks
on
the
contrary
when
they
have
many
daughters
and
wish
to
have
a
son
they
dress
the
girls
up
as
boys
on
the
whole
we
conclude
that
the
custom
of
men
dressing
as
women
and
of
women
dressing
as
men
has
been
practised
from
a
variety
of
superstitious
motives
among
which
the
principal
would
seem
to
be
the
wish
to
please
certain
powerful
spirits
or
to
deceive
others
prostitution
of
unmarried
girls
like
many
peoples
of
western
asia
in
antiquity
the
pelew
islanders
systematically
prostitute
their
unmarried
girls
for
hire
hence
just
as
in
lydia
and
cyprus
of
old
the
damsels
are
a
source
of
income
to
their
family
and
women
wait
impatiently
for
the
time
when
their
young
daughters
will
be
able
to
help
the
household
by
their
earnings
indeed
the
mother
regularly
anticipates
the
time
by
depriving
the
girl
of
her
virginity
with
her
own
hands
hence
the
theory
that
the
prostitution
of
unmarried
girls
is
a
device
to
destroy
their
virginity
without
risk
to
their
husbands
is
just
as
inapplicable
to
the
pelew
islanders
as
we
have
seen
it
to
be
to
the
peoples
of
western
asia
in
antiquity
when
a
pelew
girl
has
thus
been
prepared
for
her
vocation
by
her
mother
she
sells
her
favours
to
all
the
men
of
her
village
who
can
pay
for
them
and
who
do
not
belong
to
her
own
exogamous
clan
but
she
never
grants
her
favours
to
the
same
man
twice
accordingly
in
every
village
of
the
pelew
islands
it
may
be
taken
as
certain
that
the
men
and
women
know
each
other
carnally
except
that
members
of
the
same
clan
are
debarred
from
each
other
by
the
rule
of
exogamy
thus
a
form
of
sexual
communism
limited
only
by
the
exogamous
prohibitions
which
attach
to
the
clans
prevails
among
these
people
nor
is
this
communism
restricted
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
same
village
for
the
girls
of
each
village
are
regularly
sent
away
to
serve
as
prostitutes
in
another
village
there
they
live
with
the
men
of
one
of
the
many
clubs
or
associations
in
the
clubhouse
attending
to
the
house
consorting
freely
with
the
men
and
receiving
pay
for
their
services
a
girl
leading
this
life
in
the
clubhouse
of
another
village
is
well
treated
by
the
men
a
wrong
done
to
her
is
a
wrong
done
to
the
whole
club
and
in
her
own
village
her
value
is
increased
not
diminished
by
the
time
she
thus
spends
as
a
prostitute
in
a
neighbouring
community
after
her
period
of
service
is
over
she
may
marry
either
in
the
village
where
she
has
served
or
in
her
own
sometimes
many
or
all
of
the
young
women
of
a
village
go
together
to
act
as
prostitutes
in
a
neighbouring
village
and
for
this
they
are
well
paid
by
the
community
which
receives
them
the
money
so
earned
is
divided
among
the
chiefs
of
the
village
to
which
the
damsels
belong
such
a
joint
expedition
of
the
unmarried
girls
of
a
village
is
called
a
but
the
young
women
never
act
as
in
any
clubhouse
of
their
own
village
thus
while
the
pelew
custom
of
prostituting
the
unmarried
girls
to
all
the
men
of
their
own
village
but
not
of
their
own
clan
is
a
form
of
sexual
communism
practised
within
a
local
group
the
custom
of
prostituting
them
to
men
of
other
villages
is
a
form
of
sexual
communism
practised
between
members
of
different
local
groups
it
is
a
kind
of
these
customs
of
the
pelew
islanders
therefore
support
by
analogy
the
hypothesis
that
among
the
ancient
peoples
of
western
asia
also
the
systematic
prostitution
of
unmarried
women
may
have
been
derived
from
an
earlier
period
of
sexual
communism
a
somewhat
similar
custom
prevails
in
yap
one
of
the
western
group
of
the
caroline
islands
situated
to
the
north
of
the
pelew
group
in
each
of
the
men
s
clubhouses
are
kept
three
or
four
unmarried
girls
or
whose
business
it
is
to
minister
to
the
pleasures
of
the
men
of
the
particular
clan
or
brotherhood
to
which
the
building
belongs
as
with
the
kroomen
on
the
gold
coast
each
man
married
or
single
takes
his
turn
by
rotation
in
the
rites
through
which
each
girl
must
pass
before
she
is
deemed
ripe
for
marriage
the
natives
say
it
is
an
ordeal
or
preliminary
trial
to
fit
them
for
the
cares
and
burden
of
maternity
she
is
rarely
a
girl
of
the
same
village
and
of
course
must
be
sprung
from
a
different
sept
whenever
she
wishes
to
become
a
or
respectable
married
woman
she
may
and
is
thought
none
the
less
of
for
her
frailties
as
a
but
i
believe
this
before
marriage
is
confined
to
the
daughters
of
the
inferior
chiefs
and
commons
the
supply
of
is
generally
kept
up
by
the
purchase
of
slave
girls
from
the
neighbouring
according
to
another
account
a
must
always
be
stolen
by
force
or
cunning
from
a
district
at
some
distance
from
that
wherein
her
captors
reside
after
she
has
been
fairly
or
unfairly
captured
and
installed
in
her
new
home
she
loses
no
shade
of
respect
among
her
own
people
on
the
contrary
have
not
her
beauty
and
her
worth
received
the
highest
proof
of
her
exalted
perfection
in
the
devotion
not
of
one
but
of
a
whole
community
of
lovers
however
though
the
girl
is
nominally
stolen
from
another
district
the
matter
is
almost
always
arranged
privately
with
the
local
chief
who
consents
to
wink
hard
at
the
theft
in
consideration
of
a
good
round
sum
of
shell
money
and
stone
money
which
serves
to
salve
the
wounds
of
a
disrupted
family
and
dispel
all
thoughts
of
a
bloody
retaliation
nevertheless
the
whole
proceeding
is
still
carried
out
with
the
greatest
possible
secrecy
and
custom
of
slaying
chiefs
in
the
pelew
islands
when
the
chief
of
a
clan
has
reigned
too
long
or
has
made
himself
unpopular
the
heir
has
a
formal
right
to
put
him
to
death
though
for
reasons
which
will
appear
this
right
is
only
exercised
in
some
of
the
principal
clans
the
practice
of
regicide
if
that
word
may
be
extended
to
the
assassination
of
chiefs
is
in
these
islands
a
national
institution
regulated
by
exact
rules
and
every
high
chief
must
lay
his
account
with
it
indeed
so
well
recognized
is
the
custom
that
when
the
who
under
the
system
of
must
be
a
brother
a
nephew
or
a
cousin
on
the
mother
s
side
proves
himself
precocious
and
energetic
the
people
say
the
cousin
is
a
grown
man
the
chief
s
is
nigh
at
in
such
cases
the
plot
of
death
is
commonly
so
well
hushed
up
that
it
seldom
miscarries
the
first
care
of
the
conspirators
is
to
discover
where
the
doomed
man
keeps
his
money
for
this
purpose
an
old
woman
will
sleep
for
some
nights
in
the
house
and
make
inquiries
quietly
till
like
a
she
has
nosed
the
hoard
then
the
conspirators
come
and
the
candidate
for
the
chieftainship
despatches
his
predecessor
either
with
his
own
hand
or
by
the
hand
of
a
young
cousin
having
done
the
deed
he
takes
possession
of
the
official
residence
and
applies
to
the
widow
of
the
deceased
the
form
of
persuasion
technically
known
as
this
consists
of
putting
a
noose
round
her
neck
and
drawing
it
tighter
and
tighter
till
she
consents
to
give
up
her
late
husband
s
money
after
that
the
murderer
and
his
friends
have
nothing
further
to
do
for
the
present
but
to
remain
quietly
in
the
house
and
allow
events
to
take
their
usual
course
meantime
the
chiefs
assemble
in
the
and
the
loud
droning
notes
of
the
which
answers
the
purpose
of
a
tocsin
summon
the
whole
population
to
arms
the
warriors
muster
and
surrounding
the
house
where
the
conspirators
are
ensconced
they
shower
spears
and
stones
at
it
as
if
to
inflict
condign
punishment
on
the
assassins
but
this
is
a
mere
blind
a
sham
a
legal
fiction
intended
perhaps
to
throw
dust
in
the
eyes
of
the
ghost
and
make
him
think
that
his
death
is
being
avenged
in
point
of
fact
the
warriors
take
good
care
to
direct
their
missiles
at
the
roof
or
walls
of
the
house
for
if
they
threw
them
at
the
windows
they
might
perhaps
hurt
the
murderer
after
this
formality
has
been
satisfactorily
performed
the
regicide
steps
out
of
the
house
and
engages
in
the
genial
task
of
paying
the
death
duties
to
the
various
chiefs
assembled
when
he
has
observed
this
indispensable
ceremony
the
law
is
satisfied
all
constitutional
forms
have
been
carried
out
the
assassin
is
now
the
legitimate
successor
of
his
victim
and
reigns
in
his
stead
without
any
further
trouble
but
if
he
has
omitted
to
massacre
his
predecessor
and
has
allowed
him
to
die
a
natural
death
he
suffers
for
his
negligence
by
being
compelled
to
observe
a
long
series
of
complicated
and
irksome
formalities
before
he
can
make
good
his
succession
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
for
in
that
case
the
title
of
chief
has
to
be
formally
withdrawn
from
the
dead
man
and
conferred
on
his
successor
by
a
curious
ceremony
which
includes
the
presentation
of
a
and
a
taro
plant
to
the
new
chief
moreover
at
first
he
may
not
enter
the
chief
s
house
but
has
to
be
shut
up
in
a
tiny
hut
for
thirty
or
forty
days
during
all
the
time
of
mourning
and
even
when
that
is
over
he
may
not
come
out
till
he
has
received
and
paid
for
a
human
head
brought
him
by
the
people
of
a
friendly
state
after
that
he
still
may
not
go
to
the
until
more
formalities
have
been
fully
observed
these
comprise
a
very
costly
fishing
expedition
which
is
conducted
by
the
inhabitants
of
another
district
and
lasts
for
weeks
at
the
end
of
it
a
net
full
of
fish
is
brought
to
the
chief
s
house
and
the
people
of
the
neighbouring
communities
are
summoned
by
the
blast
of
trumpets
as
soon
as
the
stranger
fishermen
have
been
publicly
paid
for
their
services
a
relative
of
the
new
chief
steps
across
the
net
and
solemnly
splits
a
in
two
with
an
knife
made
of
a
tridacna
shell
while
at
the
same
time
he
bans
all
the
evils
that
might
befall
his
kinsman
then
without
looking
at
the
nut
he
throws
the
pieces
on
the
ground
and
if
they
fall
so
that
the
two
halves
lie
with
the
opening
upwards
it
is
an
omen
that
the
chief
will
live
long
the
pieces
of
the
nut
are
then
tied
together
and
taken
to
the
house
of
another
chief
the
friend
of
the
new
ruler
and
there
they
are
kept
in
token
that
the
ceremony
has
been
duly
performed
thereupon
the
fish
are
divided
among
the
people
the
strangers
receiving
half
this
completes
the
legal
ceremonies
of
accession
and
the
new
chief
may
now
go
about
freely
but
these
tedious
formalities
and
others
which
i
pass
over
are
dispensed
with
when
the
new
chief
has
proved
his
title
by
slaying
his
predecessor
in
that
case
the
procedure
is
much
simplified
but
on
the
other
hand
the
death
duties
are
so
very
heavy
that
only
rich
men
can
afford
to
indulge
in
the
luxury
of
regicide
hence
in
the
pelew
islands
of
or
at
least
of
yesterday
the
mode
of
succession
by
slaughter
is
now
restricted
to
a
few
families
of
the
bluest
blood
and
the
longest
purses
if
this
account
of
the
existing
or
recent
usage
of
the
pelew
islanders
sheds
little
light
on
the
motives
for
putting
chiefs
to
death
it
well
illustrates
the
precision
with
which
such
a
custom
may
be
carried
out
and
the
public
indifference
if
not
approval
with
which
it
may
be
regarded
as
an
ordinary
incident
of
constitutional
government
so
far
therefore
the
pelew
custom
bears
out
the
view
that
a
systematic
practice
of
regicide
however
strange
and
revolting
it
may
seem
to
us
is
perfectly
compatible
with
a
state
of
society
in
which
human
conduct
and
human
life
are
estimated
by
a
standard
very
different
from
ours
if
we
would
understand
the
early
history
of
institutions
we
must
learn
to
detach
ourselves
from
the
prepossessions
of
our
own
time
and
country
and
to
place
ourselves
as
far
as
possible
at
the
standpoint
of
men

that

the

unlike
the
egyptian
calendar
however
the
mexican
appears
to
have
been
regularly
corrected
by
intercalation
so
as
to
bring
it
into
harmony
with
the
solar
year
but
as
to
the
mode
of
intercalation
our
authorities
differ
according
to
the
positive
statement
of
sahagun
one
of
the
earliest
and
best
authorities
the
mexicans
corrected
the
deficiency
of
their
year
by
intercalating
one
day
in
every
fourth
year
which
is
precisely
the
correction
adopted
in
the
alexandrian
and
the
julian
calendar
see
de
sahagun
pp
where
he
expressly
asserts
the
falsehood
of
the
view
that
the
bissextile
year
was
unknown
to
the
mexicans
this
weighty
statement
is
confirmed
by
the
practice
of
the
indians
of
yucatan
like
the
aztecs
they
reckoned
a
year
to
consist
of
days
divided
into
months
of
days
each
with
days
added
so
as
to
make
a
total
of
days
but
every
fourth
year
they
intercalated
a
day
so
as
to
make
a
total
of
days

did
not

supposing
that

in

be
said
that
in

nearly
coincided

the

fell
nineteen

of

we
consider
the
close
causal
connexion
which
the
egyptians
traced
between
the
rising

the
rising
of
the
nile
it
seems
probable
that
they
started
the
new
calendar
on
the
first
of
thoth
in
a
year
in
which
the
two
natural
phenomena
coincided

pointed
out
i
it
must
have
been
a
later
discovery
based
on
continued
observations

the
heliacal
rising
of
sirius
and
of
its
gradual
displacement
through
the
whole
length
of
the
official
calendar
brugsch
indeed
went
so
far
as
to
suppose
that
the
period
was
a
discovery
of
astronomers
of
the
second
century
to
which
they
were
led
by
the
coincidence
of
the
first
of
thoth
with
the
heliacal
rising
of
sirius
in
but
the
discovery
based
as
it
is
on
a
very
simple
calculation
could
hardly
fail
to
be
made
as
soon
as
astronomers
estimated
the
length
of
the
solar
year
at
days
and
that
they
did
so
at
least
as
early
as
is
proved
conclusively

they
set
about
the

in

way
they
interpreted
the

thus
the

became
a

the
festivals

in

to
have
been
substantially
the
same
see
above
pp
the
old
festival
of
khoiak
may
have
been
transferred
to
athyr
when
the
egyptians
adopted
the
fixed
alexandrian
year
in
the
transference
would
be
intelligible
if
we
suppose
that
in
the
dates
of
all
the
egyptian
festivals
were
shifted
backward
by
about
a
month
in
order
to
restore
them
to
their
natural
places
in
the
calendar
so
it
was
reckoned
at
the
time
but
strictly
speaking
thoth
in
that
year
began
on
august
the
miscalculation
originated
in
a
blunder
of
the
ignorant
roman
pontiffs
who
being
charged
with
the
management
of
the
new
julian
calendar
at
first
intercalated
a
day
every
third
instead
of
every
fourth
year
see

theoretically
the
shift
should
have
been
or
rather
days
that
being
the
interval
between
july
and
august
or
see
the
preceding
note
if
that
shift
was
actually
made
the
calendar
date
of
any
festival
in
the
old
vague
egyptian
year
could
be
found
by
adding
or
days
to
its
date
in
the
alexandrian
year
thus
if
the
death
of
osiris
fell
on
the
of
athyr
in
the
alexandrian
year
it
should
have
fallen
on
the
or
of
khoiak
in
the
old
vague
year
and
if
his
resurrection
fell
on
the
of
athyr
in
the
alexandrian
year
it
should
have
fallen
on
the
of
khoiak
or
the
of
tybi
in
the
old
vague
year
these
calculations
agree
nearly
but
not
exactly
with
the
somewhat
uncertain
indications
of
the
denderah
calendar
above
and
also
with
the
independent
evidence
which
we
possess
that
the
resurrection
of
osiris
was
celebrated
on
the
of
khoiak
below
pp
these
approximate
agreements
to
some
extent
confirm
my
theory
that
with
the
adoption
of
the
fixed
alexandrian
year
the
dates
of
the
official
egyptian
festivals
were
shifted
from
their
accidental
places
in
the
calendar
to
their
proper
places
in
the
natural
year
since
i
published
in
the
first
edition
of
this
book
my
theory
that
with
the
adoption
of
the
fixed
alexandrian
year
in
the
egyptian
festivals
were
shifted
about
a
month
backward
in
the
year
professor
ed
meyer
has
shown
independent
grounds
for
holding
that
the
festivals
which
gave
rise
to
the
later
names
of
the
egyptian
months
were
demonstrably
held
a
month
later
in
earlier
ages
under
the
twentieth
eighteenth
indeed
partly
under
the
twelfth
dynasty
in
other
words
that
after
the
end
of
the
new
kingdom
the
festivals
and
the
corresponding
names
of
the
months
were
displaced
one
month
backwards
it
is
true
that
this
displacement
can
as
yet
be
proved
for
only
five
months
but
as
the
names
of
these
months
and
the
festivals
keep
their
relative
position
towards
each
other
the
assumption
is
inevitable
that
the
displacement
affected
not
merely
particular
festivals
but
the
whole
system
see
ed
meyer
zur
ägyptischen
berlin
pp
der
königl
preuss
akademie

thus
it
is
possible
that
the
displacement
of
the
festivals
by
a
month
backward
in
the
calendar
took
place
a
good
deal
earlier
than
i
had
supposed
in
the
uncertainty
of
the
whole
question
i
leave
my
theory
as
it
stood
if
the
results
of
the
foregoing
inquiry
be
accepted
the
resurrection
of
osiris
was
regularly
celebrated
in
egypt
on
the
of
november
from
the
year
onward
since
the
of
november
corresponded
to
the
of
athyr
the
resurrection
day
in
the
fixed
alexandrian
year
this
agrees
with
the
indications
of
the
roman
rustic
calendars
which
place
the
resurrection
that
is
the
discovery
of
osiris
between
the
and
the
of
november
yet
according
to
the
calendar
of
philocalus
the
official
roman
celebration
of
the
resurrection
seems
to
have
been
held
on
the
of
november
not
on
the
how
is
the
discrepancy
to
be
explained
th
mommsen
supposed
that
the
festival
was
officially
adopted
at
rome
at
a
time
when
the
of
athyr
of
the
vague
egyptian
year
corresponded
to
the
of
october
or
the
of
november
of
the
julian
calendar
and
that
the
romans
overlooking
the
vague
or
shifting
character
of
the
egyptian
year
fixed
the
resurrection
of
osiris
permanently
on
the
of
november
now
the
of
athyr
of
the
vague
year
corresponded
to
the
of
november
in
the
years
and
to
the
of
october
in
the
years
and
it
appears
that
the
festival
was
officially
adopted
at
rome
some
time
before
lucan
viii
it
is
unlikely
that
the
adoption
took
place
in
the
reign
of
tiberius
who
died
in
for
he
is
known
to
have
persecuted
the
egyptian
religion
tacitus
ii
suetonius
josephus
xviii
hence
mommsen
concluded
that
the
great
festival
of
osiris
was
officially
adopted
at
rome
in
the
early
years
of
the
reign
of
caligula
that
is
in
or
see
th
mommsen
inscriptionum
pars
prior
berlin
pp
dessau
latinae
vol
ii
no
this
theory
of
mommsen
s
assumes
that
in
egypt
the
festivals
were
still
regulated
by
the
old
vague
year
in
the
first
century
of
our
era
it
can
not
therefore
be
reconciled
with
the
conclusion
reached
in
the
text
that
the
egyptian
festivals
ceased
to
be
regulated
by
the
old
vague
year
from
onward
how
the
difference
of
date
between
the
official
roman
and
the
egyptian
festival
of
the
resurrection
is
to
be
explained
i
do
not
pretend
to
say
osiris
in
one
of
his
aspects
a
personification
of
the
corn
osiris

child
of
sky
and

the
legend
of
the
dismemberment
of
osiris

to
the
dismemberment

human
beings

of

at

it
has
been
pointed
out
that
on
these
solemn
occasions
as
we
learn
from
the
monuments
there
was
carried
before
the
king
on
a
pole
an
object
shaped
like
a

professor
breasted
thinks
that
the
sed
festival
is
probably
the
oldest
religious
feast
of
which
any
trace
has
been
preserved
in
egypt
he
admits
that
on
these
occasions
the
king
assumed
the
costume
and
insignia
of
osiris
and
undoubtedly
impersonated
him
and
further
that
one
of
the
ceremonies
of
this
feast
symbolized
the
resurrection
of
osiris
but
he
considers
that
the
significance
of
the
festival
is
as
yet
obscure
see
breasted
of
religion
and
thought
in
ancient
london
osiris
personated
by
the
king
of

how
did
the
conception
of
osiris
as
a
god
of
vegetation
and
of
the
dead
originate
while
adonis
and
attis
were
subordinate
figures
in
their
respective
pantheons
osiris
was
the
greatest
and
most
popular
god
of
egypt
the
personal
devotion
of
the
egyptians
to
osiris
suggests
that
he
may
have
been
a
real
man
for
all
the
permanent
religious
or
systems
of
the
world
have
been
founded
by
individual
great
men
the
historical
reality
of
osiris
as
an
old
king
of
egypt
can
be
supported
by
modern
african
analogies
it
is
maintained
by
the
discoverer
of
the

the

he

no

as

so
good

kind
that
there
is
no
need
to

him
by
rites

they
never

which
that

implies

that
they
have
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
higher
or
lower
position
of
women
rather
the
opposite
might
be
affirmed
namely
that
woman
is
generally
more
highly
esteemed
in
places
where
prevails
than
in
places
where
is
the
the
inheritance
of
property
especially
of
landed
property
through
the
mother
certainly
tends
to
raise
the
social
importance
of
women
but
this
tendency
is
never
carried
so
far
as
to
subordinate
men
politically
to

by

other
than

cousins
those
nearest
in
degree
of

having

if
there
were
no

male
as

he
would
be
succeeded
by

the

at

the

to
the
growth

in

the

traced

of

that
the

have
been
to

certainly
we
know
that
it

not

who
really
governed

and
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
in
like
manner
it
was
for
the
most
part
the
husband
and
not
the
wife
who
really
ruled
the
house

unquestionably
in

the

an
expedient
for
shifting
the

the
male
line
but
he
did
not
extend
the
theory
so
as
to

supposes
that

horkos
was
not
a

an
abstract
idea

makes
no
figure
in

that
such
a
rare
and
thin
greek
abstraction
should
through
a
gross
misunderstanding
be
transformed
into
a
highly
popular
roman
god
of
death
who
not

passed

cite

the
inference
that
these
titles
implied
paternity

is
my
own
but
in
the
text
i
have
given
some
reasons
for
thinking
that
the
romans
themselves
accepted
the
implication
warde
fowler
on
the
other
hand
prefers
to
suppose
that
the
titles
were
employed
in
a
merely
figurative
sense
to
imply
the
dependence
of
the
human
citizen
upon
his
divine
protector
but
he
admits
that
what
exactly
the
romans
understood
by
and
applied
to
deities
is
not
easy
to
determine
religious
experience
of
the
roman
pp
he
makes
at
the
same
time
the
important
observation
that
the
romans
never
so
far
as
he
is
aware
applied
the
terms
father
and
mother
to
foreign
gods
but
always
to
those
on
whom
the
original
roman
stock
looked
as
their
and
the
limitation
is
significant
and
seems
more
naturally
explicable
on
my
hypothesis
than
on
that
of
my

the

understood

this
suffices

the

the
magic

and
the

we
must
conclude
that
the

were
thought

beget

for

janus

have
been
the
theme

his
claim

be

as

by

on

the
evidence
for
it
has
been
clearly

stated
by

it
is
with
sincere
diffidence
that
i
venture
to
differ

point

have
named
but
without
for
a
moment
pitting
my
superficial
acquaintance

religion
against
their
deep
learning
i
can
not
but
think
that
the
single
positive
testimony
of
varro
on
a
matter
about
which
he
could
scarcely
be
ignorant
ought
to
outweigh
the
opinion
of
any
modern
scholar
however
learned
and
able
rule
of
greek

roman

that
certain

only
be
held

i
have
examined
both
festivals
more
closely
in
a
former
part
of
this
work
dying
pp
and
have
shown
grounds
for
holding
that
the
old
octennial
cycle
in
greece
based
on
an
attempt
to
harmonize
solar
and
lunar
time
gave
rise
to
an
octennial
festival
at
which
the
mythical
marriage
of
the
sun
and
moon
was
celebrated
by
the
dramatic
marriage
of
human
actors
who
appear
sometimes
to
have
been
the
king
and
queen
in
the
at
thebes
a
clear
reference
to
the
astronomical
character
of
the
festival
is
contained
in
the
emblems
of
the
sun
moon
stars
and
days
of
the
year
which
were
carried
in

proclus
and
another
reference
to
it
may
be
detected
in
the
legendary
marriage
of
cadmus
and
harmonia
farnell
supposes
that
the
festival
of
the
belongs
to
the
maypole
processions
universal
in
the
of
europe
of
which
the
object
is
to
quicken
the
vitalizing
powers
of
the
year
in
the
middle
of
spring
or
at
the
beginning
of

cults
of
the
greek

but
this
explanation
appears
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
octennial
period
of
the
festival
we
may
conjecture
that
the
olympic
like
the
delphic
and
the
theban
festival
was
at
first
octennial
though
in

it
