preface
to
the
revised
edition
rough
draughts
of
some
of
the
following
tales
and
essays
were
actually
written
during
a
residence
in
the
alhambra
others
were
subsequently
added
founded
on
notes
and
observations
made
there
care
was
taken
to
maintain
local
coloring
and
verisimilitude
so
that
the
whole
might
present
a
faithful
and
living
picture
of
that
microcosm
that
singular
little
world
into
which
i
had
been
fortuitously
thrown
and
about
which
the
external
world
had
a
very
imperfect
idea
it
was
my
endeavor
scrupulously
to
depict
its
half
spanish
half
oriental
character
its
mixture
of
the
heroic
the
poetic
and
the
grotesque
to
revive
the
traces
of
grace
and
beauty
fast
fading
from
its
walls
to
record
the
regal
and
chivalrous
traditions
concerning
those
who
once
trod
its
courts
and
the
whimsical
and
superstitious
legends
of
the
motley
race
now
burrowing
among
its
ruins
the
papers
thus
roughly
sketched
out
lay
for
three
or
four
years
in
my
portfolio
until
i
found
myself
in
london
in
on
the
eve
of
returning
to
the
united
states
i
then
endeavored
to
arrange
them
for
the
press
but
the
preparations
for
departure
did
not
allow
sufficient
leisure
several
were
thrown
aside
as
incomplete
the
rest
were
put
together
somewhat
hastily
and
in
rather
a
crude
and
chaotic
manner
in
the
present
edition
i
have
revised
and
rearranged
the
whole
work
enlarged
some
parts
and
added
others
including
the
papers
originally
omitted
and
have
thus
endeavored
to
render
it
more
complete
and
more
worthy
of
the
indulgent
reception
with
which
it
has
been

thrown

in
whom
neither

nor

will
obliterate
the
remembrance
of
his
gentleness
and
worth
and
here
before
setting
forth
let
me
indulge
in
a
few
previous
remarks
on
spanish
scenery
and
spanish
travelling
many
are
apt
to
picture
spain
to
their
imaginations
as
a
soft
southern
region
decked
out
with
the
luxuriant
charms
of
voluptuous
italy
on
the
contrary
though
there
are
exceptions
in
some
of
the
maritime
provinces
yet
for
the
greater
part
it
is
a
stern
melancholy
country
with
rugged
mountains
and
long
sweeping
plains
destitute
of
trees
and
indescribably
silent
and
lonesome
partaking
of
the
savage
and
solitary
character
of
africa
what
adds
to
this
silence
and
loneliness
is
the
absence
of
a
natural
consequence
of
the
want
of
groves
and
hedges
the
vulture
and
the
eagle
are
seen
wheeling
about
the
and
soaring
over
the
plains
and
groups
of
shy
bustards
stalk
about
the
heaths
but
the
myriads
of
smaller
birds
which
animate
the
whole
face
of
other
countries
are
met
with
in
but
few
provinces
in
spain
and
in
those
chiefly
among
the
orchards
and
gardens
which
surround
the
habitations
of
man
in
the
interior
provinces
the
traveller
occasionally
traverses
great
tracts
cultivated
with
grain
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
waving
at
times
with
verdure
at
other
times
naked
and
sunburnt
but
he
looks
round
in
vain
for
the
hand
that
has
tilled
the
soil
at
length
he
perceives
some
village
on
a
steep
hill
or
rugged
crag
with
mouldering
battlements
and
ruined
watchtower
a
stronghold
in
old
times
against
civil
war
or
moorish
inroad
for
the
custom
among
the
peasantry
of
congregating
together
for
mutual
protection
is
still
kept
up
in
most
parts
of
spain
in
consequence
of
the
maraudings
of
roving
freebooters
but
though
a
great
part
of
spain
is
deficient
in
the
garniture
of
groves
and
forests
and
the
softer
charms
of
ornamental
cultivation
yet
its
scenery
is
noble
in
its
severity
and
in
unison
with
the
attributes
of
its
people
and
i
think
that
i
better
understand
the
proud
hardy
frugal
and
abstemious
spaniard
his
manly
defiance
of
hardships
and
contempt
of
effeminate
indulgences
since
i
have
seen
the
country
he
inhabits
there
is
something
too
in
the
sternly
simple
features
of
the
spanish
landscape
that
impresses
on
the
soul
a
feeling
of
sublimity
the
immense
plains
of
the
castiles
and
of
la
mancha
extending
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
derive
an
interest
from
their
very
nakedness
and
immensity
and
possess
in
some
degree
the
solemn
grandeur
of
the
ocean
in
ranging
over
these
boundless
wastes
the
eye
catches
sight
here
and
there
of
a
straggling
herd
of
cattle
attended
by
a
lonely
herdsman
motionless
as
a
statue
with
his
long
slender
pike
tapering
up
like
a
lance
into
the
air
or
beholds
a
long
train
of
mules
slowly
moving
along
the
waste
like
a
train
of
camels
in
the
desert
or
a
single
horseman
armed
with
blunderbuss
and
stiletto
and
prowling
over
the
plain
thus
the
country
the
habits
the
very
looks
of
the
people
have
something
of
the
arabian
character
the
general
insecurity
of
the
country
is
evinced
in
the
universal
use
of
weapons
the
herdsman
in
the
field
the
shepherd
in
the
plain
has
his
musket
and
his
knife
the
wealthy
villager
rarely
ventures
to
the
without
his
trabuco
and
perhaps
a
servant
on
foot
with
a
blunderbuss
on
his
shoulder
and
the
most
petty
journey
is
undertaken
with
the
preparation
of
a
warlike
enterprise
the
dangers
of
the
road
produce
also
a
mode
of
travelling
resembling
on
a
diminutive
scale
the
caravans
of
the
east
the
arrieros
or
carriers
congregate
in
convoys
and
set
off
in
large
and
trains
on
appointed
days
while
additional
travellers
swell
their
number
and
contribute
to
their
strength
in
this
primitive
way
is
the
commerce
of
the
country
carried
on
the
muleteer
is
the
general
medium
of
traffic
and
the
legitimate
traverser
of
the
land
crossing
the
peninsula
from
the
pyrenees
and
the
asturias
to
the
alpuxarras
the
serrania
de
ronda
and
even
to
the
gates
of
gibraltar
he
lives
frugally
and
hardily
his
alforjas
of
coarse
cloth
hold
his
scanty
stock
of
provisions
a
leathern
bottle
hanging
at
his
contains
wine
or
water
for
a
supply
across
barren
mountains
and
thirsty
plains
a
spread
upon
the
ground
is
his
bed
at
night
and
his
his
pillow
his
low
but
and
sinewy
form
betokens
strength
his
complexion
is
dark
and
sunburnt
his
eye
resolute
but
quiet
in
its
expression
except
when
kindled
by
sudden
emotion
his
demeanor
is
frank
manly
and
courteous
and
he
never
passes
you
without
a
grave
salutation
dios
guarde
à
usted
va
usted
con
dios
caballero
god
guard
you
god
be
with
you
cavalier
as
these
men
have
often
their
whole
fortune
at
stake
upon
the
burden
of
their
mules
they
have
their
weapons
at
hand
slung
to
their
saddles
and
ready
to
be
snatched
out
for
desperate
defence
but
their
united
numbers
render
them
secure
against
petty
bands
of
marauders
and
the
solitary
bandolero
armed
to
the
teeth
and
mounted
on
his
andalusian
steed
hovers
about
them
like
a
pirate
about
a
merchant
convoy
without
daring
to
assault
the
spanish
muleteer
has
an
inexhaustible
stock
of
songs
and
ballads
with
which
to
beguile
his
incessant
wayfaring
the
airs
are
rude
and
simple
consisting
of
but
few
inflections
these
he
chants
forth
with
a
loud
voice
and
long
drawling
cadence
seated
sideways
on
his
mule
who
seems
to
listen
with
infinite
gravity
and
to
keep
time
with
his
paces
to
the
tune
the
couplets
thus
chanted
are
often
old
traditional
romances
about
the
moors
or
some
legend
of
a
saint
or
some
or
what
is
still
more
frequent
some
ballad
about
a
bold
contrabandista
or
hardy
bandolero
for
the
smuggler
and
the
robber
are
poetical
heroes
among
the
common
people
of
spain
often
the
song
of
the
muleteer
is
composed
at
the
instant
and
relates
to
some
local
scene
or
some
incident
of
the
journey
this
talent
of
singing
and
improvising
is
frequent
in
spain
and
is
said
to
have
been
inherited
from
the
moors
there
is
something
wildly
pleasing
in
listening
to
these
ditties
among
the
rude
and
lonely
scenes
they
illustrate
accompanied
as
they
are
by
the
occasional
jingle
of
the
it
has
a
most
picturesque
effect
also
to
meet
a
train
of
muleteers
in
some
first
you
hear
the
bells
of
the
leading
mules
breaking
with
their
simple
melody
the
stillness
of
the
airy
height
or
perhaps
the
voice
of
the
muleteer
admonishing
some
tardy
or
wandering
animal
or
chanting
at
the
full
stretch
of
his
lungs
some
traditionary
ballad
at
length
you
see
the
mules
slowly
winding
along
the
cragged
defile
sometimes
descending
precipitous
cliffs
so
as
to
present
themselves
in
full
relief
against
the
sky
sometimes
toiling
up
the
deep
arid
chasms
below
you
as
they
approach
you
descry
their
gay
decorations
of
worsted
stuffs
tassels
and
while
as
they
pass
by
the
ever
ready
trabuco
slung
behind
the
packs
and
saddles
gives
a
hint
of
the
insecurity
of
the
road
the
ancient
kingdom
of
granada
into
which
we
were
about
to
penetrate
is
one
of
the
most
mountainous
regions
of
spain
vast
sierras
or
chains
of
mountains
destitute
of
shrub
or
tree
and
mottled
with
variegated
marbles
and
granites
elevate
their
sunburnt
summits
against
a
sky
yet
in
their
rugged
bosoms
lie
ingulfed
verdant
and
fertile
valleys
where
the
desert
and
the
garden
strive
for
mastery
and
the
very
rock
is
as
it
were
compelled
to
yield
the
fig
the
orange
and
the
citron
and
to
blossom
with
the
myrtle
and
the
rose
in
the
wild
passes
of
these
mountains
the
sight
of
walled
towns
and
villages
built
like
eagles
nests
among
the
cliffs
and
surrounded
by
moorish
battlements
or
of
ruined
perched
on
lofty
peaks
carries
the
mind
back
to
the
chivalric
days
of
christian
and
moslem
warfare
and
to
the
romantic
struggle
for
the
conquest
of
granada
in
traversing
these
lofty
sierras
the
traveller
is
often
obliged
to
alight
and
lead
his
horse
up
and
down
the
steep
and
jagged
ascents
and
descents
resembling
the
broken
steps
of
a
staircase
sometimes
the
road
winds
along
dizzy
precipices
without
parapet
to
guard
him
from
the
gulfs
below
and
then
will
plunge
down
steep
and
dark
and
dangerous
declivities
sometimes
it
struggles
through
rugged
barrancos
or
ravines
worn
by
winter
torrents
the
obscure
path
of
the
contrabandista
while
ever
and
anon
the
ominous
cross
the
monument
of
robbery
and
murder
erected
on
a
mound
of
stones
at
some
lonely
part
of
the
road
admonishes
the
traveller
that
he
is
among
the
haunts
of
banditti
perhaps
at
that
very
moment
under
the
eye
of
some
lurking
bandolero
sometimes
in
winding
through
the
narrow
valleys
he
is
startled
by
a
hoarse
bellowing
and
beholds
above
him
on
some
green
fold
of
the
mountain
a
herd
of
fierce
andalusian
bulls
destined
for
the
combat
of
the
arena
i
have
felt
if
i
may
so
express
it
an
agreeable
horror
in
thus
contemplating
near
at
hand
these
terrific
animals
clothed
with
tremendous
strength
and
ranging
their
native
pastures
in
untamed
wildness
strangers
almost
to
the
face
of
man
they
know
no
one
but
the
solitary
herdsman
who
attends
upon
them
and
even
he
at
times
dares
not
venture
to
approach
them
the
low
bellowing
of
these
bulls
and
their
menacing
aspect
as
they
look
down
from
their
rocky
height
give
additional
wildness
to
the
savage
scenery
i
have
been
betrayed
unconsciously
into
a
longer
disquisition
than
i
intended
on
the
general
features
of
spanish
travelling
but
there
is
a
romance
about
all
the
recollections
of
the
peninsula
dear
to
the
imagination
as
our
proposed
route
to
granada
lay
through
mountainous
regions
where
the
roads
are
little
better
than
and
said
to
be
frequently
beset
by
robbers
we
took
due
travelling
precautions
forwarding
the
most
valuable
part
of
our
luggage
a
day
or
two
in
advance
by
the
arrieros
we
retained
merely
clothing
and
necessaries
for
the
journey
and
money
for
the
expenses
of
the
road
with
a
little
surplus
of
hard
dollars
by
way
of
to
satisfy
the
gentlemen
of
the
road
should
we
be
assailed
unlucky
is
the
too
wary
traveller
who
having
grudged
this
precaution
falls
into
their
clutches
they
are
apt
to
give
him
a
sound
ribroasting
for
cheating
them
out
of
their
dues
caballeros
like
them
can
not
afford
to
scour
the
roads
and
risk
the
gallows
for
a
couple
of
stout
steeds
were
provided
for
our
own
mounting
and
a
third
for
our
scanty
luggage
and
the
conveyance
of
a
sturdy
biscayan
lad
about
twenty
years
of
age
who
was
to
be
our
guide
our
groom
our
valet
and
at
all
times
our
guard
for
the
latter
office
he
was
provided
with
a
formidable
trabuco
or
carbine
with
which
he
promised
to
defend
us
against
rateros
or
solitary
footpads
but
as
to
powerful
bands
like
that
of
the
sons
of
ecija
he
confessed
they
were
quite
beyond
his
prowess
he
made
much
vainglorious
boast
about
his
weapon
at
the
outset
of
the
journey
though
to
the
discredit
of
his
generalship
it
was
suffered
to
hang
unloaded
behind
his
saddle
according
to
our
stipulations
the
man
from
whom
we
hired
the
horses
was
to
be
at
the
expense
of
their
feed
and
stabling
on
the
journey
as
well
as
of
the
maintenance
of
our
biscayan
squire
who
of
course
was
provided
with
funds
for
the
purpose
we
took
care
however
to
give
the
latter
a
private
hint
that
though
we
made
a
close
bargain
with
his
master
it
was
all
in
his
favor
as
if
he
proved
a
good
man
and
true
both
he
and
the
horses
should
live
at
our
cost
and
the
money
provided
for
their
maintenance
remain
in
his
pocket
this
unexpected
largess
with
the
occasional
present
of
a
cigar
won
his
heart
completely
he
was
in
truth
a
faithful
cheery
creature
as
full
of
saws
and
proverbs
as
that
miracle
of
squires
the
renowned
sancho
himself
whose
name
by
the
by
we
bestowed
upon
him
and
like
a
true
spaniard
though
treated
by
us
with
companionable
familiarity
he
never
for
a
moment
in
his
utmost
hilarity
overstepped
the
bounds
of
respectful
decorum
such
were
our
minor
preparations
for
the
journey
but
above
all
we
laid
in
an
ample
stock
of
and
a
genuine
disposition
to
be
pleased
determining
to
travel
in
true
contrabandista
style
taking
things
as
we
found
them
rough
or
smooth
and
mingling
with
all
classes
and
conditions
in
a
kind
of
vagabond
companionship
it
is
the
true
way
to
travel
in
spain
with
such
disposition
and
determination
what
a
country
is
it
for
a
traveller
where
the
most
miserable
inn
is
as
full
of
adventure
as
an
enchanted
castle
and
every
meal
is
in
itself
an
achievement
let
others
repine
at
the
lack
of
turnpike
roads
and
sumptuous
hotels
and
all
the
elaborate
comforts
of
a
country
cultivated
and
civilized
into
tameness
and
commonplace
but
give
me
the
rude
mountain
scramble
the
roving
wayfaring
the
half
wild
yet
frank
and
hospitable
manners
which
impart
such
a
true
to
dear
old
romantic
spain
thus
equipped
and
attended
we
cantered
out
of
fair
seville
city
at
six
in
the
morning
of
a
bright
may
day
in
company
with
a
lady
and
gentleman
of
our
acquaintance
who
rode
a
few
miles
with
us
in
the
spanish
mode
of
taking
leave
our
route
lay
through
old
alcala
de
guadaira
alcala
on
the
river
aira
the
benefactress
of
seville
that
supplies
it
with
bread
and
water
here
live
the
bakers
who
furnish
seville
with
that
delicious
bread
for
which
it
is
renowned
here
are
fabricated
those
roscas
well
known
by
the
appellation
of
de
bread
of
god
with
which
by
the
way
we
ordered
our
man
sancho
to
stock
his
alforjas
for
the
journey
well
has
this
beneficent
little
city
been
denominated
the
oven
of
seville
well
has
it
been
called
alcala
de
los
panaderos
alcala
of
the
bakers
for
a
great
part
of
its
inhabitants
are
of
that
handicraft
and
the
highway
hence
to
seville
is
constantly
traversed
by
lines
of
mules
and
donkeys
laden
with
great
panniers
of
loaves
and
roscas
i
have
said
alcala
supplies
seville
with
water
here
are
great
tanks
or
reservoirs
of
roman
and
moorish
construction
whence
water
is
conveyed
to
seville
by
noble
aqueducts
the
springs
of
alcala
are
almost
as
much
vaunted
as
its
ovens
and
to
the
lightness
sweetness
and
purity
of
its
water
is
attributed
in
some
measure
the
delicacy
of
its
bread
here
we
halted
for
a
time
at
the
ruins
of
the
old
moorish
castle
a
favorite
resort
for
picnic
parties
from
seville
where
we
had
passed
many
a
pleasant
hour
the
walls
are
of
great
extent
pierced
with
loopholes
enclosing
a
huge
square
tower
or
keep
with
the
remains
of
masmoras
or
subterranean
granaries
the
guadaira
winds
its
stream
round
the
hill
at
the
foot
of
these
ruins
whimpering
among
reeds
rushes
and
and
overhung
with
rhododendron
eglantine
yellow
myrtle
and
a
profusion
of
wild
flowers
and
aromatic
shrubs
while
along
its
banks
are
groves
of
oranges
citrons
and
pomegranates
among
which
we
heard
the
early
note
of
the
nightingale
a
picturesque
bridge
was
thrown
across
the
little
river
at
one
end
of
which
was
the
ancient
moorish
mill
of
the
castle
defended
by
a
tower
of
yellow
stone
a
fisherman
s
net
hung
against
the
wall
to
dry
and
hard
by
in
the
river
was
his
boat
a
group
of
peasant
women
in
dresses
crossing
the
arched
bridge
were
reflected
in
the
placid
stream
altogether
it
was
an
admirable
scene
for
a
the
old
moorish
mills
so
often
found
on
secluded
streams
are
characteristic
objects
in
spanish
landscape
and
suggestive
of
the
perilous
times
of
old
they
are
of
stone
and
often
in
the
form
of
towers
with
loopholes
and
battlements
capable
of
defence
in
those
warlike
days
when
the
country
on
both
sides
of
the
border
was
subject
to
sudden
inroad
and
hasty
ravage
and
when
men
had
to
labor
with
their
weapons
at
hand
and
some
place
of
temporary
refuge
our
next
was
at
gandul
where
were
the
remains
of
another
moorish
castle
with
its
ruined
tower
a
for
storks
and
commanding
a
view
over
a
vast
campiña
or
fertile
plain
with
the
mountains
of
ronda
in
the
distance
these
castles
were
strongholds
to
protect
the
plains
from
the
talas
or
forays
to
which
they
were
subject
when
the
fields
of
corn
would
be
laid
waste
the
flocks
and
herds
swept
from
the
vast
pastures
and
together
with
captive
peasantry
hurried
off
in
long
cavalgadas
across
the
borders
at
gandul
we
found
a
tolerable
posada
the
good
folks
could
not
tell
us
what
time
of
day
it
was
the
clock
only
struck
once
in
the
day
two
hours
after
noon
until
that
time
it
was
guesswork
we
guessed
it
was
full
time
to
eat
so
alighting
we
ordered
a
repast
while
that
was
in
preparation
we
visited
the
palace
once
the
residence
of
the
marquis
of
gandul
all
was
gone
to
decay
there
were
but
two
or
three
rooms
habitable
and
very
poorly
furnished
yet
here
were
the
remains
of
grandeur
a
terrace
where
fair
dames
and
gentle
cavaliers
may
once
have
walked
a
and
ruined
garden
with
and
here
we
were
joined
by
a
fat
curate
who
gathered
a
bouquet
of
roses
and
presented
it
very
gallantly
to
the
lady
who
accompanied
us
below
the
palace
was
the
mill
with
and
aloes
in
front
and
a
pretty
stream
of
pure
water
we
took
a
seat
in
the
shade
and
the
millers
all
leaving
their
work
sat
down
and
smoked
with
us
for
the
andalusians
are
always
ready
for
a
gossip
they
were
waiting
for
the
regular
visit
of
the
barber
who
came
once
a
week
to
put
all
their
chins
in
order
he
arrived
shortly
afterwards
a
lad
of
seventeen
mounted
on
a
donkey
eager
to
display
his
new
alforjas
or
just
bought
at
a
fair
price
one
dollar
to
be
paid
on
john
s
day
in
june
by
which
time
he
trusted
to
have
mown
beards
enough
to
put
him
in
funds
by
the
time
the
laconic
clock
of
the
castle
had
struck
two
we
had
finished
our
dinner
so
taking
leave
of
our
seville
friends
and
leaving
the
millers
still
under
the
hands
of
the
barber
we
set
off
on
our
ride
across
the
campiña
it
was
one
of
those
vast
plains
common
in
spain
where
for
miles
and
miles
there
is
neither
house
nor
tree
unlucky
the
traveller
who
has
to
traverse
it
exposed
as
we
were
to
heavy
and
repeated
showers
of
rain
there
is
no
escape
nor
shelter
our
only
protection
was
our
spanish
cloaks
which
nearly
covered
man
and
horse
but
grew
heavier
every
mile
by
the
time
we
had
lived
through
one
shower
we
would
see
another
slowly
but
inevitably
approaching
fortunately
in
the
interval
there
would
be
an
outbreak
of
bright
warm
andalusian
sunshine
which
would
make
our
cloaks
send
up
wreaths
of
steam
but
which
partially
dried
them
before
the
next
drenching
shortly
after
sunset
we
arrived
at
arahal
a
little
town
among
the
hills
we
found
it
in
a
bustle
with
a
party
of
miquelets
who
were
patrolling
the
country
to
ferret
out
robbers
the
appearance
of
foreigners
like
ourselves
was
an
unusual
circumstance
in
an
interior
country
town
and
little
spanish
towns
of
the
kind
are
easily
put
in
a
state
of
gossip
and
wonderment
by
such
an
occurrence
mine
host
with
two
or
three
old
wiseacre
comrades
in
brown
cloaks
studied
our
passports
in
a
corner
of
the
posada
while
an
alguazil
took
notes
by
the
dim
light
of
a
lamp
the
passports
were
in
foreign
languages
and
perplexed
them
but
our
squire
sancho
assisted
them
in
their
studies
and
magnified
our
importance
with
the
grandiloquence
of
a
spaniard
in
the
mean
time
the
magnificent
distribution
of
a
few
cigars
had
won
the
hearts
of
all
around
us
in
a
little
while
the
whole
community
seemed
put
in
agitation
to
make
us
welcome
the
corregidor
himself
waited
upon
us
and
a
great
was
ostentatiously
bolstered
into
our
room
by
our
landlady
for
the
accommodation
of
that
important
personage
the
commander
of
the
patrol
took
supper
with
us
a
lively
talking
laughing
andaluz
who
had
made
a
campaign
in
south
america
and
recounted
his
exploits
in
love
and
war
with
much
pomp
of
phrase
vehemence
of
gesticulation
and
mysterious
rolling
of
the
eye
he
told
us
that
he
had
a
list
of
all
the
robbers
in
the
country
and
meant
to
ferret
out
every
mother
s
son
of
them
he
offered
us
at
the
same
time
some
of
his
soldiers
as
an
escort
one
is
enough
to
protect
you
señors
the
robbers
know
me
and
know
my
men
the
sight
of
one
is
enough
to
spread
terror
through
a
whole
we
thanked
him
for
his
offer
but
assured
him
in
his
own
strain
that
with
the
protection
of
our
redoubtable
squire
sancho
we
were
not
afraid
of
all
the
ladrones
of
andalusia
while
we
were
supping
with
our
drawcansir
friend
we
heard
the
notes
of
a
guitar
and
the
click
of
castanets
and
presently
a
chorus
of
voices
singing
a
popular
air
in
fact
mine
host
had
gathered
together
the
amateur
singers
and
musicians
and
the
rustic
belles
of
the
neighborhood
and
on
going
forth
the
courtyard
or
patio
of
the
inn
presented
a
scene
of
true
spanish
festivity
we
took
our
seats
with
mine
host
and
hostess
and
the
commander
of
the
patrol
under
an
archway
opening
into
the
court
the
guitar
passed
from
hand
to
hand
but
a
jovial
shoemaker
was
the
orpheus
of
the
place
he
was
a
fellow
with
huge
black
whiskers
his
sleeves
were
rolled
up
to
his
elbows
he
touched
the
guitar
with
masterly
skill
and
sang
a
little
amorous
ditty
with
an
expressive
leer
at
the
women
with
whom
he
was
evidently
a
favorite
he
afterwards
danced
a
fandango
with
a
buxom
andalusian
damsel
to
the
great
delight
of
the
spectators
but
none
of
the
females
present
could
compare
with
mine
host
s
pretty
daughter
pepita
who
had
slipped
away
and
made
her
toilette
for
the
occasion
and
had
covered
her
head
with
roses
and
who
distinguished
herself
in
a
bolero
with
a
handsome
young
dragoon
we
ordered
our
host
to
let
wine
and
refreshment
circulate
freely
among
the
company
yet
though
there
was
a
motley
assembly
of
soldiers
muleteers
and
villagers
no
one
exceeded
the
bounds
of
sober
enjoyment
the
scene
was
a
study
for
a
painter
the
picturesque
group
of
dancers
the
troopers
in
their
half
military
dresses
the
peasantry
wrapped
in
their
brown
cloaks
nor
must
i
omit
to
mention
the
old
meagre
alguazil
in
a
short
black
cloak
who
took
no
notice
of
anything
going
on
but
sat
in
a
corner
diligently
writing
by
the
dim
light
of
a
huge
copper
lamp
that
might
have
figured
in
the
days
of
don
quixote
the
following
morning
was
bright
and
balmy
as
a
may
morning
ought
to
be
according
to
the
poets
leaving
arahal
at
seven
o
clock
with
all
the
posada
at
the
door
to
cheer
us
off
we
pursued
our
way
through
a
fertile
country
covered
with
grain
and
beautifully
verdant
but
which
in
summer
when
the
harvest
is
over
and
the
fields
parched
and
brown
must
be
monotonous
and
lonely
for
as
in
our
ride
of
yesterday
there
were
neither
houses
nor
people
to
be
seen
the
latter
all
congregate
in
villages
and
strongholds
among
the
hills
as
if
these
fertile
plains
were
still
subject
to
the
ravages
of
the
moor
at
noon
we
came
to
where
there
was
a
group
of
trees
beside
a
brook
in
a
rich
meadow
here
we
alighted
to
make
our
meal
it
was
really
a
luxurious
spot
among
wild
flowers
and
aromatic
herbs
with
birds
singing
around
us
knowing
the
scanty
larders
of
spanish
inns
and
the
houseless
tracts
we
might
have
to
traverse
we
had
taken
care
to
have
the
alforjas
of
our
squire
well
stocked
with
cold
provisions
and
his
bota
or
leathern
bottle
which
might
hold
a
gallon
filled
to
the
neck
with
choice
valdepeñas
wine
as
we
depended
more
upon
these
for
our
than
even
his
trabuco
we
exhorted
him
to
be
more
attentive
in
keeping
them
well
charged
and
i
must
do
him
the
justice
to
say
that
his
namesake
the
sancho
panza
was
never
a
more
provident
purveyor
though
the
alforjas
and
the
bota
were
frequently
and
vigorously
assailed
throughout
the
journey
they
had
a
wonderful
power
of
repletion
our
vigilant
squire
sacking
everything
that
remained
from
our
repasts
at
the
inns
to
supply
these
junketings
by
the
which
were
his
delight
on
the
present
occasion
he
spread
quite
a
sumptuous
variety
of
remnants
on
the
greensward
before
us
graced
with
an
excellent
ham
brought
from
seville
then
taking
his
seat
at
a
little
distance
he
solaced
himself
with
what
remained
in
the
alforjas
a
visit
or
two
to
the
bota
made
him
as
merry
and
chirruping
as
a
grasshopper
filled
with
dew
on
my
comparing
his
contents
of
the
alforjas
to
sancho
s
skimming
of
the
at
the
wedding
of
cammacho
i
found
he
was
well
versed
in
the
history
of
don
quixote
but
like
many
of
the
common
people
of
spain
firmly
believed
it
to
be
a
true
history
all
that
happened
a
long
time
ago
señor
said
he
with
an
inquiring
look
a
very
long
time
i
replied
i
dare
say
more
than
a
thousand
years
still
looking
dubiously
i
dare
say
not
the
squire
was
satisfied
nothing
pleased
the
varlet
more
than
my
comparing
him
to
the
renowned
sancho
for
devotion
to
the
trencher
and
he
called
himself
by
no
other
name
throughout
the
journey
our
repast
being
finished
we
spread
our
cloaks
on
the
greensward
under
the
tree
and
took
a
luxurious
siesta
in
the
spanish
fashion
the
clouding
up
of
the
weather
however
warned
us
to
depart
and
a
harsh
wind
sprang
up
from
the
southeast
towards
five
o
clock
we
arrived
at
osuna
a
town
of
fifteen
thousand
inhabitants
situated
on
the
side
of
a
hill
with
a
church
and
a
ruined
castle
the
posada
was
outside
of
the
walls
it
had
a
cheerless
look
the
evening
being
cold
the
inhabitants
were
crowded
round
a
brasero
in
a
and
the
hostess
was
a
dry
old
woman
who
looked
like
a
mummy
every
one
eyed
us
askance
as
we
entered
as
spaniards
are
apt
to
regard
strangers
a
cheery
respectful
salutation
on
our
part
caballeroing
them
and
touching
our
sombreros
set
spanish
pride
at
ease
and
when
we
took
our
seat
among
them
lit
our
cigars
and
passed
the
round
among
them
our
victory
was
complete
i
have
never
known
a
spaniard
whatever
his
rank
or
condition
who
would
suffer
himself
to
be
outdone
in
courtesy
and
to
the
common
spaniard
the
present
of
a
cigar
puro
is
irresistible
care
however
must
be
taken
never
to
offer
him
a
present
with
an
air
of
superiority
and
condescension
he
is
too
much
of
a
caballero
to
receive
favors
at
the
cost
of
his
dignity
leaving
osuna
at
an
early
hour
the
next
morning
we
entered
the
sierra
or
range
of
mountains
the
road
wound
through
picturesque
scenery
but
lonely
and
a
cross
here
and
there
by
the
the
sign
of
a
murder
showed
that
we
were
now
coming
among
the
robber
this
wild
and
intricate
country
with
its
silent
plains
and
valleys
intersected
by
mountains
has
ever
been
famous
for
banditti
it
was
here
that
omar
ibn
hassan
a
among
the
moslems
held
ruthless
sway
in
the
ninth
century
disputing
dominion
even
with
the
caliphs
of
cordova
this
too
was
a
part
of
the
regions
so
often
ravaged
during
the
reign
of
ferdinand
and
isabella
by
ali
atar
the
old
moorish
alcayde
of
loxa
of
boabdil
so
that
it
was
called
ali

garden

famous
in
spanish
brigand
story
had
his
favorite
in
the
course
of
the
day
we
passed
through
fuente
la
piedra
near
a
little
salt
lake
of
the
same
name
a
beautiful
sheet
of
water
reflecting
like
a
mirror
the
distant
mountains
we
now
came
in
sight
of
antiquera
that
old
city
of
warlike
reputation
lying
in
the
lap
of
the
great
sierra
which
runs
through
andalusia
a
noble
vega
spread
out
before
it
a
picture
of
mild
fertility
set
in
a
frame
of
rocky
mountains
crossing
a
gentle
river
we
approached
the
city
between
hedges
and
gardens
in
which
nightingales
were
pouring
forth
their
evening
song
about
nightfall
we
arrived
at
the
gates
everything
in
this
venerable
city
has
a
decidedly
spanish
stamp
it
lies
too
much
out
of
the
frequented
track
of
foreign
travel
to
have
its
old
usages
trampled
out
here
i
observed
old
men
still
wearing
the
montero
or
ancient
once
common
throughout
spain
while
the
young
men
wore
the
little
hat
with
brim
turned
up
all
round
like
a
cup
turned
down
in
its
saucer
while
the
brim
was
set
off
with
little
black
tufts
like
cockades
the
women
too
were
all
in
mantillas
and
basquinas
the
fashions
of
paris
had
not
reached
antiquera
pursuing
our
course
through
a
spacious
street
we
put
up
at
the
posada
of
san
fernando
as
antiquera
though
a
considerable
city
is
as
i
observed
somewhat
out
of
the
track
of
travel
i
had
anticipated
bad
quarters
and
poor
fare
at
the
inn
i
was
agreeably
disappointed
therefore
by
a
amply
supplied
and
what
were
still
more
acceptable
good
clean
rooms
and
comfortable
beds
our
man
sancho
felt
himself
as
well
off
as
his
namesake
when
he
had
the
run
of
the
duke
s
kitchen
and
let
me
know
as
i
retired
for
the
night
that
it
had
been
a
proud
time
for
the
alforjas
early
in
the
morning
may
i
strolled
to
the
ruins
of
the
old
moorish
castle
which
itself
had
been
reared
on
the
ruins
of
a
roman
fortress
here
taking
my
seat
on
the
remains
of
a
crumbling
tower
i
enjoyed
a
grand
and
varied
landscape
beautiful
in
itself
and
full
of
storied
and
romantic
associations
for
i
was
now
in
the
very
heart
of
the
country
famous
for
the
chivalrous
contests
between
moor
and
christian
below
me
in
its
lap
of
hills
lay
the
old
warrior
city
so
often
mentioned
in
chronicle
and
ballad
out
of
yon
gate
and
down
yon
hill
paraded
the
band
of
spanish
cavaliers
of
highest
rank
and
bravest
bearing
to
make
that
foray
during
the
war
and
conquest
of
granada
which
ended
in
the
lamentable
massacre
among
the
mountains
of
malaga
and
laid
all
andalusia
in
mourning
beyond
spread
out
the
vega
covered
with
gardens
and
orchards
and
fields
of
grain
and
enamelled
meadows
inferior
only
to
the
famous
vega
of
granada
to
the
right
the
rock
of
the
lovers
stretched
like
a
cragged
promontory
into
the
plain
whence
the
daughter
of
the
moorish
alcayde
and
her
lover
when
closely
pursued
threw
themselves
in
despair
the
matin
peal
from
church
and
convent
below
me
rang
sweetly
in
the
morning
air
as
i
descended
the
was
beginning
to
throng
with
the
populace
who
traffic
in
the
abundant
produce
of
the
vega
for
this
is
the
mart
of
an
agricultural
region
in
the
were
abundance
of
freshly
plucked
roses
for
sale
for
not
a
dame
or
damsel
of
andalusia
thinks
her
gala
dress
complete
without
a
rose
shining
like
a
gem
among
her
raven
tresses
on
returning
to
the
inn
i
found
our
man
sancho
in
high
gossip
with
the
landlord
and
two
or
three
of
his
he
had
just
been
telling
some
marvellous
story
about
seville
which
mine
host
seemed
piqued
to
match
with
one
equally
marvellous
about
antiquera
there
was
once
a
fountain
he
said
in
one
of
the
public
squares
called
fuente
del
the
fountain
of
the
bull
because
the
water
gushed
from
the
mouth
of
a
bull
s
head
carved
of
stone
underneath
the
head
was
inscribed
en
frente
del
toro
se
hallen
tesoro
in
front
of
the
bull
there
is
treasure
many
digged
in
front
of
the
fountain
but
lost
their
labor
and
found
no
money
at
last
one
knowing
fellow
construed
the
motto
a
different
way
it
is
in
the
forehead
frente
of
the
bull
that
the
treasure
is
to
be
found
said
he
to
himself
and
i
am
the
man
to
find
it
accordingly
he
came
late
at
night
with
a
mallet
and
knocked
the
head
to
pieces
and
what
do
you
think
he
found
plenty
of
gold
and
diamonds
cried
sancho
eagerly
he
found
nothing
rejoined
mine
host
dryly
and
he
ruined
the
here
a
great
laugh
was
set
up
by
the
landlord
s
who
considered
sancho
completely
taken
in
by
what
i
presume
was
one
of
mine
host
s
standing
jokes
leaving
antiquera
at
eight
o
clock
we
had
a
delightful
ride
along
the
little
river
and
by
gardens
and
orchards
fragrant
with
the
odors
of
spring
and
vocal
with
the
nightingale
our
road
passed
round
the
rock
of
the
lovers
el
peñon
de
los
enamorados
which
rose
in
a
precipice
above
us
in
the
course
of
the
morning
we
passed
through
archidona
situated
in
the
breast
of
a
high
hill
with
a
mountain
towering
above
it
and
the
ruins
of
a
moorish
fortress
it
was
a
great
toil
to
ascend
a
steep
stony
street
leading
up
into
the
city
although
it
bore
the
encouraging
name
of
calle
real
del
llano
the
royal
street
of
the
plain
but
it
was
still
a
greater
toil
to
descend
from
this
mountain
city
on
the
other
side
at
noon
we
halted
in
sight
of
archidona
in
a
pleasant
little
meadow
among
hills
covered
with
our
cloaks
were
spread
on
the
grass
under
an
elm
by
the
side
of
a
bubbling
rivulet
our
horses
were
tethered
where
they
might
crop
the
herbage
and
sancho
was
told
to
produce
his
alforjas
he
had
been
unusually
silent
this
morning
ever
since
the
laugh
raised
at
his
expense
but
now
his
countenance
brightened
and
he
produced
his
alforjas
with
an
air
of
triumph
they
contained
the
contributions
of
four
days
journeying
but
had
been
signally
enriched
by
the
foraging
of
the
previous
evening
in
the
plenteous
inn
at
antiquera
and
this
seemed
to
furnish
him
with
a
to
the
banter
of
mine
host
en
frente
del
toro
se
hallen
tesoro
would
he
exclaim
with
a
chuckling
laugh
as
he
drew
forth
the
heterogeneous
contents
one
by
one
in
a
series
which
seemed
to
have
no
end
first
came
forth
a
shoulder
of
roasted
kid
very
little
the
worse
for
wear
then
an
entire
partridge
then
a
great
morsel
of
salted
codfish
wrapped
in
paper
then
the
residue
of
a
ham
then
the
half
of
a
pullet
together
with
several
rolls
of
bread
and
a
rabble
rout
of
oranges
figs
raisins
and
walnuts
his
bota
also
had
been
recruited
with
some
excellent
wine
of
malaga
at
every
fresh
apparition
from
his
larder
he
would
enjoy
our
ludicrous
surprise
throwing
himself
back
on
the
grass
shouting
with
laughter
and
exclaiming
frente
del
toro
frente
del
toro
ah
señors
they
thought
sancho
a
simpleton
at
antiquera
but
sancho
knew
where
to
find
the
while
we
were
diverting
ourselves
with
his
simple
drollery
a
solitary
beggar
approached
who
had
almost
the
look
of
a
pilgrim
he
had
a
venerable
gray
beard
and
was
evidently
very
old
supporting
himself
on
a
staff
yet
age
had
not
bowed
him
down
he
was
tall
and
erect
and
had
the
wreck
of
a
fine
form
he
wore
a
round
andalusian
hat
a
jacket
and
leathern
breeches
gaiters
and
sandals
his
dress
though
old
and
patched
was
decent
his
demeanor
manly
and
he
addressed
us
with
the
grave
courtesy
that
is
to
be
remarked
in
the
lowest
spaniard
we
were
in
a
favorable
mood
for
such
a
visitor
and
in
a
freak
of
capricious
charity
gave
him
some
silver
a
loaf
of
fine
wheaten
bread
and
a
goblet
of
our
choice
wine
of
malaga
he
received
them
thankfully
but
without
any
grovelling
tribute
of
gratitude
tasting
the
wine
he
held
it
up
to
the
light
with
a
slight
beam
of
surprise
in
his
eye
then
quaffing
it
off
at
a
draught
it
is
many
years
said
he
since
i
have
tasted
such
wine
it
is
a
cordial
to
an
old
man
s
then
looking
at
the
beautiful
wheaten
loaf
sea
tal
pan
blessed
be
such
bread
so
saying
he
put
it
in
his
wallet
we
urged
him
to
eat
it
on
the
spot
no
señors
replied
he
the
wine
i
had
either
to
drink
or
leave
but
the
bread
i
may
take
home
to
share
with
my
our
man
sancho
sought
our
eye
and
reading
permission
there
gave
the
old
man
some
of
the
ample
fragments
of
our
repast
on
condition
however
that
he
should
sit
down
and
make
a
meal
he
accordingly
took
his
seat
at
some
little
distance
from
us
and
began
to
eat
slowly
and
with
a
sobriety
and
decorum
that
would
have
become
a
hidalgo
there
was
altogether
a
measured
manner
and
a
quiet
about
the
old
man
that
made
me
think
that
he
had
seen
better
days
his
language
too
though
simple
had
occasionally
something
picturesque
and
almost
poetical
in
the
phraseology
i
set
him
down
for
some
cavalier
i
was
mistaken
it
was
nothing
but
the
innate
courtesy
of
a
spaniard
and
the
poetical
turn
of
thought
and
language
often
to
be
found
in
the
lowest
classes
of
this
people
for
fifty
years
he
told
us
he
had
been
a
shepherd
but
now
he
was
out
of
employ
and
destitute
when
i
was
a
young
man
said
he
nothing
could
harm
or
trouble
me
i
was
always
well
always
gay
but
now
i
am
years
of
age
and
a
beggar
and
my
heart
begins
to
fail
still
he
was
not
a
regular
mendicant
it
was
not
until
recently
that
want
had
driven
him
to
this
degradation
and
he
gave
a
touching
picture
of
the
struggle
between
hunger
and
pride
when
abject
destitution
first
came
upon
him
he
was
returning
from
malaga
without
money
he
had
not
tasted
food
for
some
time
and
was
crossing
one
of
the
great
plains
of
spain
where
there
were
but
few
habitations
when
almost
dead
with
hunger
he
applied
at
the
door
of
a
venta
or
country
inn
usted
por
dios
hermano
excuse
us
brother
for
god
s
sake
was
the
reply
the
usual
mode
in
spain
of
refusing
a
beggar
i
turned
away
said
he
with
shame
greater
than
my
hunger
for
my
heart
was
yet
too
proud
i
came
to
a
river
with
high
banks
and
deep
rapid
current
and
felt
tempted
to
throw
myself
in
what
should
such
an
old
worthless
wretched
man
as
i
live
for
but
when
i
was
on
the
brink
of
the
current
i
thought
on
the
blessed
virgin
and
turned
away
i
travelled
on
until
i
saw
a
at
a
little
distance
from
the
road
and
entered
the
outer
gate
of
the
the
door
was
shut
but
there
were
two
young
señoras
at
a
window
i
approached
and
begged
usted
por
dios
hermano
and
the
window
closed
i
crept
out
of
the
but
hunger
overcame
me
and
my
heart
gave
way
i
thought
my
hour
at
hand
so
i
laid
myself
down
at
the
gate
commended
myself
to
the
holy
virgin
and
covered
my
head
to
die
in
a
little
while
afterwards
the
master
of
the
house
came
home
seeing
me
lying
at
his
gate
he
uncovered
my
head
had
pity
on
my
gray
hairs
took
me
into
his
house
and
gave
me
food
so
señors
you
see
that
one
should
always
put
confidence
in
the
protection
of
the
the
old
man
was
on
his
way
to
his
native
place
archidona
which
was
in
full
view
on
its
steep
and
rugged
mountain
he
pointed
to
the
ruins
of
its
castle
that
castle
he
said
was
inhabited
by
a
moorish
king
at
the
time
of
the
wars
of
granada
queen
isabella
invaded
it
with
a
great
army
but
the
king
looked
down
from
his
castle
among
the
clouds
and
laughed
her
to
scorn
upon
this
the
virgin
appeared
to
the
queen
and
guided
her
and
her
army
up
a
mysterious
path
in
the
mountains
which
had
never
before
been
known
when
the
moor
saw
her
coming
he
was
astonished
and
springing
with
his
horse
from
a
precipice
was
dashed
to
pieces
the
marks
of
his
horse
s
hoofs
said
the
old
man
are
to
be
seen
in
the
margin
of
the
rock
to
this
day
and
see
señors
yonder
is
the
road
by
which
the
queen
and
her
army
mounted
you
see
it
like
a
ribbon
up
the
mountain
s
side
but
the
miracle
is
that
though
it
can
be
seen
at
a
distance
when
you
come
near
it
disappears
the
ideal
road
to
which
he
pointed
was
undoubtedly
a
sandy
ravine
of
the
mountain
which
looked
narrow
and
defined
at
a
distance
but
became
broad
and
indistinct
on
an
approach
as
the
old
man
s
heart
warmed
with
wine
and
wassail
he
went
on
to
tell
us
a
story
of
the
buried
treasure
left
under
the
castle
by
the
moorish
king
his
own
house
was
next
to
the
foundations
of
the
castle
the
curate
and
notary
dreamed
three
times
of
the
treasure
and
went
to
work
at
the
place
pointed
out
in
their
dreams
his
own
heard
the
sound
of
their
pickaxes
and
spades
at
night
what
they
found
nobody
knows
they
became
suddenly
rich
but
kept
their
own
secret
thus
the
old
man
had
once
been
next
door
to
fortune
but
was
doomed
never
to
get
under
the
same
roof
i
have
remarked
that
the
stories
of
treasure
buried
by
the
moors
so
popular
throughout
spain
are
most
current
among
the
poorest
people
kind
nature
consoles
with
shadows
for
the
lack
of
substantials
the
thirsty
man
dreams
of
fountains
and
running
streams
the
hungry
man
of
banquets
and
the
poor
man
of
heaps
of
hidden
gold
nothing
certainly
is
more
opulent
than
the
imagination
of
a
beggar
our
afternoon
s
ride
took
us
through
a
steep
and
rugged
defile
of
the
mountains
called
puerte
del
rey
the
pass
of
the
king
being
one
of
the
great
passes
into
the
territories
of
granada
and
the
one
by
which
king
ferdinand
conducted
his
army
towards
sunset
the
road
winding
round
a
hill
brought
us
in
sight
of
the
famous
little
frontier
city
of
loxa
which
repulsed
ferdinand
from
its
walls
its
arabic
name
implies
guardian
and
such
it
was
to
the
vega
of
granada
being
one
of
its
advanced
guards
it
was
the
stronghold
of
that
fiery
veteran
old
ali
atar
of
boabdil
and
here
it
was
that
the
latter
collected
his
troops
and
sallied
forth
on
that
disastrous
foray
which
ended
in
the
death
of
the
old
alcayde
and
his
own
captivity
from
its
commanding
position
at
the
gate
as
it
were
of
this
loxa
has
not
unaptly
been
termed
the
key
of
granada
it
is
wildly
picturesque
built
along
the
face
of
an
arid
mountain
the
ruins
of
a
moorish
alcazar
or
citadel
crown
a
rocky
mound
which
rises
out
of
the
centre
of
the
town
the
river
xenil
washes
its
base
winding
among
rocks
and
groves
and
gardens
and
meadows
and
crossed
by
a
moorish
bridge
above
the
city
all
is
savage
and
sterile
below
is
the
richest
vegetation
and
the
freshest
verdure
a
similar
contrast
is
presented
by
the
river
above
the
bridge
it
is
placid
and
grassy
reflecting
groves
and
gardens
below
it
is
rapid
noisy
and
tumultuous
the
sierra
nevada
the
royal
mountains
of
granada
crowned
with
perpetual
snow
form
the
distant
boundary
to
this
varied
landscape
one
of
the
most
characteristic
of
romantic
spain
alighting
at
the
entrance
of
the
city
we
gave
our
horses
to
sancho
to
lead
them
to
the
inn
while
we
strolled
about
to
enjoy
the
singular
beauty
of
the
environs
as
we
crossed
the
bridge
to
a
fine
alameda
or
public
walk
the
bells
tolled
the
hour
of
orison
at
the
sound
the
wayfarers
whether
on
business
or
pleasure
paused
took
off
their
hats
crossed
themselves
and
repeated
their
evening
prayer
a
pious
custom
still
rigidly
observed
in
retired
parts
of
spain
altogether
it
was
a
solemn
and
beautiful
evening
scene
and
we
wandered
on
as
the
evening
gradually
closed
and
the
new
moon
began
to
glitter
between
the
high
elms
of
the
alameda
we
were
roused
from
this
quiet
state
of
enjoyment
by
the
voice
of
our
trusty
squire
hailing
us
from
a
distance
he
came
up
to
us
out
of
breath
ah
señores
cried
he
el
pobre
sancho
no
es
nada
sin
don
ah
señors
poor
sancho
is
nothing
without
don
quixote
he
had
been
alarmed
at
our
not
coming
to
the
inn
loxa
was
such
a
wild
mountain
place
full
of
contrabandistas
enchanters
and
infiernos
he
did
not
well
know
what
might
have
happened
and
set
out
to
seek
us
inquiring
after
us
of
every
person
he
met
until
he
traced
us
across
the
bridge
and
to
his
great
joy
caught
sight
of
us
strolling
in
the
alameda
the
inn
to
which
he
conducted
us
was
called
the
corona
or
crown
and
we
found
it
quite
in
keeping
with
the
character
of
the
place
the
inhabitants
of
which
seem
still
to
retain
the
bold
fiery
spirit
of
the
olden
time
the
hostess
was
a
young
and
handsome
andalusian
widow
whose
trim
basquiña
of
black
silk
fringed
with
bugles
set
off
the
play
of
a
graceful
form
and
round
pliant
limbs
her
step
was
firm
and
elastic
her
dark
eye
was
full
of
fire
and
the
coquetry
of
her
air
and
varied
ornaments
of
her
person
showed
that
she
was
accustomed
to
be
admired
she
was
well
matched
by
a
brother
nearly
about
her
own
age
they
were
perfect
models
of
the
andalusian
majo
and
maja
he
was
tall
vigorous
and
with
a
clear
olive
complexion
a
dark
beaming
eye
and
curling
chestnut
whiskers
that
met
under
his
chin
he
was
gallantly
dressed
in
a
short
green
velvet
jacket
fitted
to
his
shape
profusely
decorated
with
silver
buttons
with
a
white
handkerchief
in
each
pocket
he
had
breeches
of
the
same
with
rows
of
buttons
from
the
hips
to
the
knees
a
pink
silk
handkerchief
round
his
neck
gathered
through
a
ring
on
the
bosom
of
a
neatly
plaited
shirt
a
sash
round
the
waist
to
match
bottinas
or
of
the
finest
russet
leather
elegantly
worked
and
open
at
the
calf
to
show
his
stocking
and
russet
shoes
setting
off
a
foot
as
he
was
standing
at
the
door
a
horseman
rode
up
and
entered
into
low
and
earnest
conversation
with
him
he
was
dressed
in
a
similar
style
and
almost
with
equal
finery
a
man
about
thirty
with
strong
roman
features
handsome
though
slightly
pitted
with
the
with
a
free
bold
and
somewhat
daring
air
his
powerful
black
horse
was
decorated
with
tassels
and
fanciful
trappings
and
a
couple
of
blunderbusses
hung
behind
the
saddle
he
had
the
air
of
one
of
those
contrabandistas
i
have
seen
in
the
mountains
of
ronda
and
evidently
had
a
good
understanding
with
the
brother
of
mine
hostess
nay
if
i
mistake
not
he
was
a
favored
admirer
of
the
widow
in
fact
the
whole
inn
and
its
inmates
had
something
of
a
contrabandista
aspect
and
a
blunderbuss
stood
in
a
corner
beside
the
guitar
the
horseman
i
have
mentioned
passed
his
evening
in
the
posada
and
sang
several
bold
mountain
romances
with
great
spirit
as
we
were
at
supper
two
poor
asturians
put
in
in
distress
begging
food
and
a
night
s
lodging
they
had
been
waylaid
by
robbers
as
they
came
from
a
fair
among
the
mountains
robbed
of
a
horse
which
carried
all
their
stock
in
trade
stripped
of
their
money
and
most
of
their
apparel
beaten
for
having
offered
resistance
and
left
almost
naked
in
the
road
my
companion
with
a
prompt
generosity
natural
to
him
ordered
them
a
supper
and
a
bed
and
gave
them
a
sum
of
money
to
help
them
forward
towards
their
home
as
the
evening
advanced
the
thickened
a
large
man
about
sixty
years
of
age
of
powerful
frame
came
strolling
in
to
gossip
with
mine
hostess
he
was
dressed
in
the
ordinary
andalusian
costume
but
had
a
huge
sabre
tucked
under
his
arm
wore
large
moustaches
and
had
something
of
a
lofty
swaggering
air
every
one
seemed
to
regard
him
with
great
deference
our
man
sancho
whispered
to
us
that
he
was
don
ventura
rodriguez
the
hero
and
champion
of
loxa
famous
for
his
prowess
and
the
strength
of
his
arm
in
the
time
of
the
french
invasion
he
surprised
six
troopers
who
were
asleep
he
first
secured
their
horses
then
attacked
them
with
his
sabre
killed
some
and
took
the
rest
prisoners
for
this
exploit
the
king
allows
him
a
peseta
the
fifth
of
a
duro
or
dollar
per
day
and
has
dignified
him
with
the
title
of
don
i
was
amused
to
behold
his
swelling
language
and
demeanor
he
was
evidently
a
thorough
andalusian
boastful
as
brave
his
sabre
was
always
in
his
hand
or
under
his
arm
he
carries
it
always
about
with
him
as
a
child
does
its
doll
calls
it
his
santa
teresa
and
says
when
i
draw
it
the
earth
trembles
tiembla
la
tierra
i
sat
until
a
late
hour
listening
to
the
varied
themes
of
this
motley
group
who
mingled
together
with
the
unreserve
of
a
spanish
posada
we
had
contrabandista
songs
stories
of
robbers
guerrilla
exploits
and
moorish
legends
the
last
were
from
our
handsome
landlady
who
gave
a
poetical
account
of
the
infiernos
or
infernal
regions
of
loxa
dark
caverns
in
which
subterranean
streams
and
waterfalls
make
a
mysterious
sound
the
common
people
say
that
there
are
shut
up
there
from
the
time
of
the
moors
and
that
the
moorish
kings
kept
their
treasures
in
those
caverns
i
retired
to
bed
with
my
imagination
excited
by
all
that
i
had
seen
and
heard
in
this
old
warrior
city
scarce
had
i
fallen
asleep
when
i
was
aroused
by
a
horrid
din
and
uproar
that
might
have
confounded
the
hero
of
la
mancha
himself
whose
experience
of
spanish
inns
was
a
continual
uproar
it
seemed
for
a
moment
as
if
the
moors
were
once
more
breaking
into
the
town
or
the
infiernos
of
which
mine
hostess
talked
had
broken
loose
i
sallied
forth
half
dressed
to
reconnoitre
it
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
charivari
to
celebrate
the
nuptials
of
an
old
man
with
a
buxom
damsel
wishing
him
joy
of
his
bride
and
his
serenade
i
returned
to
my
more
quiet
bed
and
slept
soundly
until
morning
while
dressing
i
amused
myself
in
reconnoitring
the
populace
from
my
window
there
were
groups
of
young
men
in
the
trim
fanciful
andalusian
costume
with
brown
cloaks
thrown
about
them
in
true
spanish
style
which
can
not
be
imitated
and
little
round
majo
hats
stuck
on
with
a
peculiar
knowing
air
they
had
the
same
galliard
look
which
i
have
remarked
among
the
dandy
mountaineers
of
ronda
indeed
all
this
part
of
andalusia
abounds
with
such
characters
they
loiter
about
the
towns
and
villages
seem
to
have
plenty
of
time
and
plenty
of
money
horse
to
ride
and
weapon
to
great
gossips
great
smokers
apt
at
touching
the
guitar
singing
couplets
to
their
maja
belles
and
famous
dancers
of
the
bolero
throughout
all
spain
the
men
however
poor
have
a
gentlemanlike
abundance
of
leisure
seeming
to
consider
it
the
attribute
of
a
true
cavaliero
never
to
be
in
a
hurry
but
the
andalusians
are
gay
as
well
as
leisurely
and
have
none
of
the
squalid
accompaniments
of
idleness
the
adventurous
contraband
trade
which
prevails
throughout
these
mountain
regions
and
along
the
maritime
borders
of
andalusia
is
doubtless
at
the
bottom
of
this
galliard
character
in
contrast
to
the
costume
of
these
groups
was
that
of
two
valencians
conducting
a
donkey
laden
with
articles
of
merchandise
their
musket
slung
crosswise
over
his
back
ready
for
action
they
wore
round
jackets
jalecos
wide
linen
bragas
or
drawers
scarce
reaching
to
the
knees
and
looking
like
kilts
red
fajas
or
sashes
swathed
tightly
round
their
waists
sandals
of
espartal
or
bass
weed
colored
kerchiefs
round
their
heads
somewhat
in
the
style
of
turbans
but
leaving
the
top
of
the
head
uncovered
in
short
their
whole
appearance
having
much
of
the
traditional
moorish
stamp
on
leaving
loxa
we
were
joined
by
a
cavalier
and
and
followed
on
foot
by
an
escopetero
or
musketeer
he
saluted
us
courteously
and
soon
let
us
into
his
quality
he
was
chief
of
the
customs
or
rather
i
should
suppose
chief
of
an
armed
company
whose
business
it
is
to
patrol
the
roads
and
look
out
for
contrabandistas
the
escopetero
was
one
of
his
guards
in
the
course
of
our
morning
s
ride
i
drew
from
him
some
particulars
concerning
the
smugglers
who
have
risen
to
be
a
kind
of
mongrel
chivalry
in
spain
they
come
into
andalusia
he
said
from
various
parts
but
especially
from
la
mancha
sometimes
to
receive
goods
to
be
smuggled
on
an
appointed
night
across
the
line
at
the
plaza
or
strand
of
gibraltar
sometimes
to
meet
a
vessel
which
is
to
hover
on
a
given
night
off
a
certain
part
of
the
coast
they
keep
together
and
travel
in
the
night
in
the
daytime
they
lie
quiet
in
barrancos
gullies
of
the
mountains
or
lonely
where
they
are
generally
well
received
as
they
make
the
family
liberal
presents
of
their
smuggled
wares
indeed
much
of
the
finery
and
trinkets
worn
by
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
mountain
hamlets
and
are
presents
from
the
gay
and
contrabandistas
arrived
at
the
part
of
the
coast
where
a
vessel
is
to
meet
them
they
look
out
at
night
from
some
rocky
point
or
headland
if
they
descry
a
sail
near
the
shore
they
make
a
concerted
signal
sometimes
it
consists
in
suddenly
displaying
a
lantern
three
times
from
beneath
the
folds
of
a
cloak
if
the
signal
is
answered
they
descend
to
the
shore
and
prepare
for
quick
work
the
vessel
runs
close
in
all
her
boats
are
busy
landing
the
smuggled
goods
made
up
into
snug
packages
for
transportation
on
horseback
these
are
hastily
thrown
on
the
beach
as
hastily
gathered
up
and
packed
on
the
horses
and
then
the
contrabandistas
clatter
off
to
the
mountains
they
travel
by
the
roughest
wildest
and
most
solitary
roads
where
it
is
almost
fruitless
to
pursue
them
the
guards
do
not
attempt
it
they
take
a
different
course
when
they
hear
of
one
of
these
bands
returning
full
freighted
through
the
mountains
they
go
out
in
force
sometimes
twelve
infantry
and
eight
horsemen
and
take
their
station
where
the
mountain
defile
opens
into
the
plain
the
infantry
who
lie
in
ambush
some
distance
within
the
defile
suffer
the
band
to
pass
then
rise
and
fire
upon
them
the
contrabandistas
dash
forward
but
are
met
in
front
by
the
horsemen
a
wild
skirmish
ensues
the
contrabandistas
if
hard
pressed
become
desperate
some
dismount
use
their
horses
as
breastworks
and
fire
over
their
backs
others
cut
the
cords
let
the
packs
fall
off
to
delay
the
enemy
and
endeavor
to
escape
with
their
steeds
some
get
off
in
this
way
with
the
loss
of
their
packages
some
are
taken
horses
packages
and
all
others
abandon
everything
and
make
their
escape
by
scrambling
up
the
mountains
and
then
cried
sancho
who
had
been
listening
with
a
greedy
ear
hacen
ladrones
and
then
they
become
legitimate
robbers
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
sancho
s
idea
of
a
legitimate
calling
of
the
kind
but
the
chief
of
customs
told
me
it
was
really
the
case
that
the
smugglers
when
thus
reduced
to
extremity
thought
they
had
a
kind
of
right
to
take
the
road
and
lay
travellers
under
contribution
until
they
had
collected
funds
enough
to
mount
and
equip
themselves
in
contrabandista
style
towards
noon
our
wayfaring
companion
took
leave
of
us
and
turned
up
a
steep
defile
followed
by
his
escopetero
and
shortly
afterwards
we
emerged
from
the
mountains
and
entered
upon
the
vega
of
granada
our
last
s
repast
was
taken
under
a
grove
of
on
the
border
of
a
rivulet
we
were
in
a
classical
neighborhood
for
not
far
off
were
the
groves
and
orchards
of
the
soto
de
roma
this
according
to
fabulous
tradition
was
a
retreat
founded
by
count
julian
to
console
his
daughter
florinda
it
was
a
rural
resort
of
the
moorish
kings
of
granada
and
has
in
modern
times
been
granted
to
the
duke
of
wellington
our
worthy
squire
made
a
half
melancholy
face
as
he
drew
forth
for
the
last
time
the
contents
of
his
alforjas
lamenting
that
our
expedition
was
drawing
to
a
close
for
with
such
cavaliers
he
said
he
could
travel
to
the
world
s
end
our
repast
however
was
a
gay
one
made
under
such
delightful
auspices
the
day
was
without
a
cloud
the
heat
of
the
sun
was
tempered
by
cool
breezes
from
the
mountains
before
us
extended
the
glorious
vega
in
the
distance
was
romantic
granada
surmounted
by
the
ruddy
towers
of
the
alhambra
while
far
above
it
the
snowy
summits
of
the
sierra
nevada
shone
like
silver
our
repast
finished
we
spread
our
cloaks
and
took
our
last
siesta
lulled
by
the
humming
of
bees
among
the
flowers
and
the
notes
of
doves
among
the
when
the
sultry
hours
were
passed
we
resumed
our
journey
after
a
time
we
overtook
a
pursy
little
man
shaped
not
unlike
a
toad
and
mounted
on
a
mule
he
fell
into
conversation
with
sancho
and
finding
we
were
strangers
undertook
to
guide
us
to
a
good
posada
he
was
an
escribano
notary
he
said
and
knew
the
city
as
thoroughly
as
his
own
pocket
ah
dios
señores
what
a
city
you
are
going
to
see
such
streets
such
squares
such
palaces
and
then
the
women
ah
santa
maria
purísima
what
women
but
the
posada
you
talk
of
said
i
are
you
sure
it
is
a
good
one
good
santa

the
best

grand

luxurious

of
down
ah

you
will
fare
like
king

in
the
and
how
will
my
horses

cried
sancho
like
king
chico
s
horses
con
leche
y
bollos
para
chocolate
and
milk
with
sugar
cakes
for
breakfast
giving
the
squire
a
knowing
wink
and
a
leer
after
such
satisfactory
accounts
nothing
more
was
to
be
desired
on
that
head
so
we
rode
quietly
on
the
squab
little
notary
taking
the
lead
and
turning
to
us
every
moment
with
some
fresh
exclamation
about
the
grandeurs
of
granada
and
the
famous
times
we
were
to
have
at
the
posada
thus
escorted
we
passed
between
hedges
of
aloes
and
indian
figs
and
through
that
wilderness
of
gardens
with
which
the
vega
is
embroidered
and
arrived
about
sunset
at
the
gates
of
the
city
our
officious
little
conductor
conveyed
us
up
one
street
and
down
another
until
he
rode
into
the
of
an
inn
where
he
appeared
to
be
perfectly
at
home
summoning
the
landlord
by
his
christian
name
he
committed
us
to
his
care
as
two
cavalleros
de
mucho
valor
worthy
of
his
best
apartments
and
most
sumptuous
fare
we
were
instantly
reminded
of
the
patronizing
stranger
who
introduced
gil
blas
with
such
a
flourish
of
trumpets
to
the
host
and
hostess
of
the
inn
at
pennaflor
ordering
trouts
for
his
supper
and
eating
voraciously
at
his
expense
you
know
not
what
you
possess
cried
he
to
the
innkeeper
and
his
wife
you
have
a
treasure
in
your
house
behold
in
this
young
gentleman
the
eighth
wonder
of
the
world
nothing
in
this
house
is
too
good
for
señor
gil
blas
of
santillane
who
deserves
to
be
entertained
like
a
determined
that
the
little
notary
should
not
eat
trouts
at
our
expense
like
his
prototype
of
pennaflor
we
forbore
to
ask
him
to
supper
nor
had
we
reason
to
reproach
ourselves
with
ingratitude
for
we
found
before
morning
the
little
varlet
who
was
no
doubt
a
good
friend
of
the
landlord
had
decoyed
us
into
one
of
the
shabbiest
posadas
in
granada
palace
of
the
alhambra
to
the
traveller
imbued
with
a
feeling
for
the
historical
and
poetical
so
inseparably
intertwined
in
the
annals
of
romantic
spain
the
alhambra
is
as
much
an
object
of
devotion
as
is
the
caaba
to
all
true
moslems
how
many
legends
and
traditions
true
and
fabulous
how
many
songs
and
ballads
arabian
and
spanish
of
love
and
war
and
chivalry
are
associated
with
this
oriental
pile
it
was
the
royal
abode
of
the
moorish
kings
where
surrounded
with
the
splendors
and
refinements
of
asiatic
luxury
they
held
dominion
over
what
they
vaunted
as
a
terrestrial
paradise
and
made
their
last
stand
for
empire
in
spain
the
royal
palace
forms
but
a
part
of
a
fortress
the
walls
of
which
studded
with
towers
stretch
irregularly
round
the
whole
crest
of
a
hill
a
spur
of
the
sierra
nevada
or
snowy
mountains
and
overlook
the
city
externally
it
is
a
rude
congregation
of
towers
and
battlements
with
no
regularity
of
plan
nor
grace
of
architecture
and
giving
little
promise
of
the
grace
and
beauty
which
prevail
within
in
the
time
of
the
moors
the
fortress
was
capable
of
containing
within
its
outward
precincts
an
army
of
forty
thousand
men
and
served
occasionally
as
a
stronghold
of
the
sovereigns
against
their
rebellious
subjects
after
the
kingdom
had
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
christians
the
alhambra
continued
to
be
a
royal
demesne
and
was
occasionally
inhabited
by
the
castilian
monarchs
the
emperor
charles
commenced
a
sumptuous
palace
within
its
walls
but
was
deterred
from
completing
it
by
repeated
shocks
of
earthquakes
the
last
royal
residents
were
philip
and
his
beautiful
queen
elizabetta
of
parma
early
in
the
eighteenth
century
great
preparations
were
made
for
their
reception
the
palace
and
gardens
were
placed
in
a
state
of
repair
and
a
new
suite
of
apartments
erected
and
decorated
by
artists
brought
from
italy
the
sojourn
of
the
sovereigns
was
transient
and
after
their
departure
the
palace
once
more
became
desolate
still
the
place
was
maintained
with
some
military
state
the
governor
held
it
immediately
from
the
crown
its
jurisdiction
extended
down
into
the
suburbs
of
the
city
and
was
independent
of
the
of
granada
a
considerable
garrison
was
kept
up
the
governor
had
his
apartments
in
the
front
of
the
old
moorish
palace
and
never
descended
into
granada
without
some
military
parade
the
fortress
in
fact
was
a
little
town
of
itself
having
several
streets
of
houses
within
its
walls
together
with
a
franciscan
convent
and
a
parochial
church
the
desertion
of
the
court
however
was
a
fatal
blow
to
the
alhambra
its
beautiful
halls
became
desolate
and
some
of
them
fell
to
ruin
the
gardens
were
destroyed
and
the
fountains
ceased
to
play
by
degrees
the
dwellings
became
filled
with
a
loose
and
lawless
population
contrabandistas
who
availed
themselves
of
its
independent
jurisdiction
to
carry
on
a
wide
and
daring
course
of
smuggling
and
thieves
and
rogues
of
all
sorts
who
made
this
their
place
of
refuge
whence
they
might
depredate
upon
granada
and
its
vicinity
the
strong
arm
of
government
at
length
interfered
the
whole
community
was
thoroughly
sifted
none
were
suffered
to
remain
but
such
as
were
of
honest
character
and
had
legitimate
right
to
a
residence
the
greater
part
of
the
houses
were
demolished
and
a
mere
hamlet
left
with
the
parochial
church
and
the
franciscan
convent
during
the
recent
troubles
in
spain
when
granada
was
in
the
hands
of
the
french
the
alhambra
was
garrisoned
by
their
troops
and
the
palace
was
occasionally
inhabited
by
the
french
commander
with
that
enlightened
taste
which
has
ever
distinguished
the
french
nation
in
their
conquests
this
monument
of
moorish
elegance
and
grandeur
was
rescued
from
the
absolute
ruin
and
desolation
that
were
overwhelming
it
the
roofs
were
repaired
the
saloons
and
galleries
protected
from
the
weather
the
gardens
cultivated
the
watercourses
restored
the
fountains
once
more
made
to
throw
up
their
sparkling
showers
and
spain
may
thank
her
invaders
for
having
preserved
to
her
the
most
beautiful
and
interesting
of
her
historical
monuments
on
the
departure
of
the
french
they
blew
up
several
towers
of
the
outer
wall
and
left
the
fortifications
scarcely
tenable
since
that
time
the
military
importance
of
the
post
is
at
an
end
the
garrison
is
a
handful
of
invalid
soldiers
whose
principal
duty
is
to
guard
some
of
the
outer
towers
which
serve
occasionally
as
a
prison
of
state
and
the
governor
abandoning
the
lofty
hill
of
the
alhambra
resides
in
the
centre
of
granada
for
the
more
convenient
dispatch
of
his
official
duties
i
can
not
conclude
this
brief
notice
of
the
state
of
the
fortress
without
bearing
testimony
to
the
honorable
exertions
of
its
present
commander
don
francisco
de
serna
who
is
tasking
all
the
limited
resources
at
his
command
to
put
the
palace
in
a
state
of
repair
and
by
his
judicious
precautions
has
for
some
time
arrested
its
too
certain
decay
had
his
predecessors
discharged
the
duties
of
their
station
with
equal
fidelity
the
alhambra
might
yet
have
remained
in
almost
its
pristine
beauty
were
government
to
second
him
with
means
equal
to
his
zeal
this
relic
of
it
might
still
be
preserved
for
many
generations
to
adorn
the
land
and
attract
the
curious
and
enlightened
of
every
clime
our
first
object
of
course
on
the
morning
after
our
arrival
was
a
visit
to
this
edifice
it
has
been
so
often
however
and
so
minutely
described
by
travellers
that
i
shall
not
undertake
to
give
a
comprehensive
and
elaborate
account
of
it
but
merely
occasional
sketches
of
parts
with
the
incidents
and
associations
connected
with
them
leaving
our
posada
and
traversing
the
renowned
square
of
the
vivarrambla
once
the
scene
of
moorish
jousts
and
tournaments
now
a
crowded
we
proceeded
along
the
zacatin
the
main
street
of
what
in
the
time
of
the
moors
was
the
great
bazaar
and
where
small
shops
and
narrow
alleys
still
retain
the
oriental
character
crossing
an
open
place
in
front
of
the
palace
of
the
we
ascended
a
confined
and
winding
street
the
name
of
which
reminded
us
of
the
chivalric
days
of
granada
it
is
called
the
calle
or
street
of
the
gomeres
from
a
moorish
family
famous
in
chronicle
and
song
this
street
led
up
to
the
puerta
de
las
granadas
a
massive
gateway
of
grecian
architecture
built
by
charles
forming
the
entrance
to
the
domains
of
the
alhambra
at
the
gate
were
two
or
three
ragged
superannuated
soldiers
dozing
on
a
stone
bench
the
successors
of
the
zegris
and
the
abencerrages
while
a
tall
meagre
varlet
whose
cloak
was
evidently
intended
to
conceal
the
ragged
state
of
his
nether
garments
was
lounging
in
the
sunshine
and
gossiping
with
an
ancient
sentinel
on
duty
he
joined
us
as
we
entered
the
gate
and
offered
his
services
to
show
us
the
fortress
i
have
a
traveller
s
dislike
to
officious
ciceroni
and
did
not
altogether
like
the
garb
of
the
applicant
you
are
well
acquainted
with
the
place
i
presume
ninguno
mas
pues
señor
soy
hijo
de
la
nobody
better
in
fact
sir
i
am
a
son
of
the
alhambra
the
common
spaniards
have
certainly
a
most
poetical
way
of
expressing
themselves
a
son
of
the
alhambra
the
appellation
caught
me
at
once
the
very
tattered
garb
of
my
new
acquaintance
assumed
a
dignity
in
my
eyes
it
was
emblematic
of
the
fortunes
of
the
place
and
befitted
the
progeny
of
a
ruin
i
put
some
further
questions
to
him
and
found
that
his
title
was
legitimate
his
family
had
lived
in
the
fortress
from
generation
to
generation
ever
since
the
time
of
the
conquest
his
name
was
mateo
ximenes
then
perhaps
said
i
you
may
be
a
descendant
from
the
great
cardinal
ximenes
dios
sabe
god
knows
señor
it
may
be
so
we
are
the
oldest
family
in
the
alhambra
old
christians
without
any
taint
of
moor
or
jew
i
know
we
belong
to
some
great
family
or
other
but
i
forget
whom
my
father
knows
all
about
it
he
has
the
coat
of
arms
hanging
up
in
his
cottage
up
in
the
there
is
not
any
spaniard
however
poor
but
has
some
claim
to
high
pedigree
the
first
title
of
this
ragged
worthy
however
had
completely
captivated
me
so
i
gladly
accepted
the
services
of
the
son
of
the
we
now
found
ourselves
in
a
deep
narrow
ravine
filled
with
beautiful
groves
with
a
steep
avenue
and
various
footpaths
winding
through
it
bordered
with
stone
seats
and
ornamented
with
fountains
to
our
left
we
beheld
the
towers
of
the
alhambra
beetling
above
us
to
our
right
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
ravine
we
were
equally
dominated
by
rival
towers
on
a
rocky
eminence
these
we
were
told
were
the
torres
vermejos
or
vermilion
towers
so
called
from
their
ruddy
hue
no
one
knows
their
origin
they
are
of
a
date
much
anterior
to
the
alhambra
some
suppose
them
to
have
been
built
by
the
romans
others
by
some
wandering
colony
of
phœnicians
ascending
the
steep
and
shady
avenue
we
arrived
at
the
foot
of
a
huge
square
moorish
tower
forming
a
kind
of
barbican
through
which
passed
the
main
entrance
to
the
fortress
within
the
barbican
was
another
group
of
veteran
invalids
one
mounting
guard
at
the
portal
while
the
rest
wrapped
in
their
tattered
cloaks
slept
on
the
stone
benches
this
portal
is
called
the
gate
of
justice
from
the
tribunal
held
within
its
porch
during
the
moslem
domination
for
the
immediate
trial
of
petty
causes
a
custom
common
to
the
oriental
nations
and
occasionally
alluded
to
in
the
sacred
scriptures
judges
and
officers
shalt
thou
make
thee
all
thy
and
they
shall
judge
the
people
with
just
the
great
vestibule
or
porch
of
the
gate
is
formed
by
an
immense
arabian
arch
of
the
horseshoe
form
which
springs
to
half
the
height
of
the
tower
on
the
keystone
of
this
arch
is
engraven
a
gigantic
hand
within
the
vestibule
on
the
keystone
of
the
portal
is
sculptured
in
like
manner
a
gigantic
key
those
who
pretend
to
some
knowledge
of
mohammedan
symbols
affirm
that
the
hand
is
the
emblem
of
doctrine
the
five
fingers
designating
the
five
principal
commandments
of
the
creed
of
islam
fasting
pilgrimage
ablution
and
war
against
infidels
the
key
say
they
is
the
emblem
of
the
faith
or
of
power
the
key
of
daoud
or
david
transmitted
to
the
prophet
and
the
key
of
the
house
of
david
will
i
lay
upon
his
shoulder
so
he
shall
open
and
none
shall
shut
and
he
shall
shut
and
none
shall

xxii
the
key
we
are
told
was
emblazoned
on
the
standard
of
the
moslems
in
opposition
to
the
christian
emblem
of
the
cross
when
they
subdued
spain
or
andalusia
it
betokened
the
conquering
power
invested
in
the
prophet

that
hath
the
key
of
david
he
that

and
no
man
shutteth
and
shutteth
and
no
man

iii
a
different
explanation
of
these
emblems
however
was
given
by
the
legitimate
son
of
the
alhambra
and
one
more
in
unison
with
the
notions
of
the
common
people
who
attach
something
of
mystery
and
magic
to
everything
moorish
and
have
all
kinds
of
superstitions
connected
with
this
old
moslem
fortress
according
to
mateo
it
was
a
tradition
handed
down
from
the
oldest
inhabitants
and
which
he
had
from
his
father
and
grandfather
that
the
hand
and
key
were
magical
devices
on
which
the
fate
of
the
alhambra
depended
the
moorish
king
who
built
it
was
a
great
magician
or
as
some
believed
had
sold
himself
to
the
devil
and
had
laid
the
whole
fortress
under
a
magic
spell
by
this
means
it
had
remained
standing
for
several
years
in
defiance
of
storms
and
earthquakes
while
almost
all
other
buildings
of
the
moors
had
fallen
to
ruin
and
disappeared
this
spell
the
tradition
went
on
to
say
would
last
until
the
hand
on
the
outer
arch
should
reach
down
and
grasp
the
key
when
the
whole
pile
would
tumble
to
pieces
and
all
the
treasures
buried
beneath
it
by
the
moors
would
be
revealed
notwithstanding
this
ominous
prediction
we
ventured
to
pass
through
the
gateway
feeling
some
little
assurance
against
magic
art
in
the
protection
of
the
virgin
a
statue
of
whom
we
observed
above
the
portal
after
passing
through
the
barbican
we
ascended
a
narrow
lane
winding
between
walls
and
came
on
an
open
esplanade
within
the
fortress
called
the
plaza
de
los
algibes
or
place
of
the
cisterns
from
great
reservoirs
which
undermine
it
cut
in
the
living
rock
by
the
moors
to
receive
the
water
brought
by
conduits
from
the
darro
for
the
supply
of
the
fortress
here
also
is
a
well
of
immense
depth
furnishing
the
purest
and
coldest
of
water
another
monument
of
the
delicate
taste
of
the
moors
who
were
indefatigable
in
their
exertions
to
obtain
that
element
in
its
crystal
purity
in
front
of
this
esplanade
is
the
splendid
pile
commenced
by
charles
and
intended
it
is
said
to
eclipse
the
residence
of
the
moorish
kings
much
of
the
oriental
edifice
intended
for
the
winter
season
was
demolished
to
make
way
for
this
massive
pile
the
grand
entrance
was
blocked
up
so
that
the
present
entrance
to
the
moorish
palace
is
through
a
simple
and
almost
humble
portal
in
a
corner
with
all
the
massive
grandeur
and
architectural
merit
of
the
palace
of
charles
we
regarded
it
as
an
arrogant
intruder
and
passing
by
it
with
a
feeling
almost
of
scorn
rang
at
the
moslem
portal
while
waiting
for
admittance
our
cicerone
mateo
ximenes
informed
us
that
the
royal
palace
was
intrusted
to
the
care
of
a
worthy
old
maiden
dame
called
doña
but
who
according
to
spanish
custom
went
by
the
more
neighborly
appellation
of
tia
antonia
aunt
antonia
who
maintained
the
moorish
halls
and
gardens
in
order
and
showed
them
to
strangers
while
we
were
talking
the
door
was
opened
by
a
plump
little
andalusian
damsel
whom
mateo
addressed
as
dolores
but
who
from
her
bright
looks
and
cheerful
disposition
evidently
merited
a
merrier
name
mateo
informed
me
in
a
whisper
that
she
was
the
niece
of
tia
antonia
and
i
found
she
was
the
good
fairy
who
was
to
conduct
us
through
the
enchanted
palace
under
her
guidance
we
crossed
the
threshold
and
were
at
once
transported
as
if
by
magic
wand
into
other
times
and
an
oriental
realm
and
were
treading
the
scenes
of
arabian
story
nothing
could
be
in
greater
contrast
than
the
unpromising
exterior
of
the
pile
with
the
scene
now
before
us
we
found
ourselves
in
a
vast
patio
or
court
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
length
and
upwards
of
eighty
feet
in
breadth
paved
with
white
marble
and
decorated
at
each
end
with
light
moorish
peristyles
one
of
which
supported
an
elegant
gallery
of
fretted
architecture
along
the
mouldings
of
the
cornices
and
on
various
parts
of
the
walls
were
escutcheons
and
ciphers
and
cufic
and
arabic
characters
in
high
relief
repeating
the
pious
mottoes
of
the
moslem
monarchs
the
builders
of
the
alhambra
or
extolling
their
grandeur
and
munificence
along
the
centre
of
the
court
extended
an
immense
basin
or
tank
estanque
a
hundred
and
feet
in
length
in
breadth
and
five
in
depth
receiving
its
water
from
two
marble
vases
hence
it
is
called
the
court
of
the
alberca
from
al
beerkah
the
arabic
for
a
pond
or
tank
great
numbers
of
were
to
be
seen
gleaming
through
the
waters
of
the
basin
and
it
was
bordered
by
hedges
of
roses
passing
from
the
court
of
the
alberca
under
a
moorish
archway
we
entered
the
renowned
court
of
lions
no
part
of
the
edifice
gives
a
more
complete
idea
of
its
original
beauty
than
this
for
none
has
suffered
so
little
from
the
ravages
of
time
in
the
centre
stands
the
fountain
famous
in
song
and
story
the
alabaster
basins
still
shed
their
diamond
drops
the
twelve
lions
which
support
them
and
give
the
court
its
name
still
cast
forth
crystal
streams
as
in
the
days
of
boabdil
the
lions
however
are
unworthy
of
their
fame
being
of
miserable
sculpture
the
work
probably
of
some
christian
captive
the
court
is
laid
out
in
instead
of
its
ancient
and
appropriate
pavement
of
tiles
or
marble
the
alteration
an
instance
of
bad
taste
was
made
by
the
french
when
in
possession
of
granada
round
the
four
sides
of
the
court
are
light
arabian
arcades
of
open
filigree
work
supported
by
slender
pillars
of
white
marble
which
it
is
supposed
were
originally
gilded
the
architecture
like
that
in
most
parts
of
the
interior
of
the
palace
is
characterized
by
elegance
rather
than
grandeur
bespeaking
a
delicate
and
graceful
taste
and
a
disposition
to
indolent
enjoyment
when
one
looks
upon
the
fairy
traces
of
the
peristyles
and
the
apparently
fragile
fretwork
of
the
walls
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
so
much
has
survived
the
wear
and
tear
of
centuries
the
shocks
of
earthquakes
the
violence
of
war
and
the
quiet
though
no
less
baneful
pilferings
of
the
tasteful
traveller
it
is
almost
sufficient
to
excuse
the
popular
tradition
that
the
whole
is
protected
by
a
magic
charm
on
one
side
of
the
court
a
rich
portal
opens
into
the
hall
of
the
abencerrages
so
called
from
the
gallant
cavaliers
of
that
illustrious
line
who
were
here
perfidiously
massacred
there
are
some
who
doubt
the
whole
story
but
our
humble
cicerone
mateo
pointed
out
the
very
wicket
of
the
portal
through
which
they
were
introduced
one
by
one
into
the
court
of
lions
and
the
white
marble
fountain
in
the
centre
of
the
hall
beside
which
they
were
beheaded
he
showed
us
also
certain
broad
ruddy
stains
on
the
pavement
traces
of
their
blood
which
according
to
popular
belief
can
never
be
effaced
finding
we
listened
to
him
apparently
with
easy
faith
he
added
that
there
was
often
heard
at
night
in
the
court
of
lions
a
low
confused
sound
resembling
the
murmuring
of
a
multitude
and
now
and
then
a
faint
tinkling
like
the
distant
clank
of
chains
these
sounds
were
made
by
the
spirits
of
the
murdered
abencerrages
who
nightly
haunt
the
scene
of
their
suffering
and
invoke
the
vengeance
of
heaven
on
their
destroyer
the
sounds
in
question
had
no
doubt
been
produced
as
i
had
afterwards
an
opportunity
of
ascertaining
by
the
bubbling
currents
and
tinkling
falls
of
water
conducted
under
the
pavement
through
pipes
and
channels
to
supply
the
fountains
but
i
was
too
considerate
to
intimate
such
an
idea
to
the
humble
chronicler
of
the
alhambra
encouraged
by
my
easy
credulity
mateo
gave
me
the
following
as
an
undoubted
fact
which
he
had
from
his
grandfather
there
was
once
an
invalid
soldier
who
had
charge
of
the
alhambra
to
show
it
to
strangers
as
he
was
one
evening
about
twilight
passing
through
the
court
of
lions
he
heard
footsteps
on
the
hall
of
the
abencerrages
supposing
some
strangers
to
be
lingering
there
he
advanced
to
attend
upon
them
when
to
his
astonishment
he
beheld
four
moors
richly
dressed
with
gilded
cuirasses
and
cimeters
and
poniards
glittering
with
precious
stones
they
were
walking
to
and
fro
with
solemn
pace
but
paused
and
beckoned
to
him
the
old
soldier
however
took
to
flight
and
could
never
afterwards
be
prevailed
upon
to
enter
the
alhambra
thus
it
is
that
men
sometimes
turn
their
backs
upon
fortune
for
it
is
the
firm
opinion
of
mateo
that
the
moors
intended
to
reveal
the
place
where
their
treasures
lay
buried
a
successor
to
the
invalid
soldier
was
more
knowing
he
came
to
the
alhambra
poor
but
at
the
end
of
a
year
went
off
to
malaga
bought
houses
set
up
a
carriage
and
still
lives
there
one
of
the
richest
as
well
as
oldest
men
of
the
place
all
which
mateo
sagely
surmised
was
in
consequence
of
his
finding
out
the
golden
secret
of
these
phantom
moors
i
now
perceived
i
had
made
an
invaluable
acquaintance
in
this
son
of
the
alhambra
one
who
knew
all
the
apocryphal
history
of
the
place
and
firmly
believed
in
it
and
whose
memory
was
stuffed
with
a
kind
of
knowledge
for
which
i
have
a
lurking
fancy
but
which
is
too
apt
to
be
considered
rubbish
by
less
indulgent
philosophers
i
determined
to
cultivate
the
acquaintance
of
this
learned
theban
immediately
opposite
the
hall
of
the
abencerrages
a
portal
richly
adorned
leads
into
a
hall
of
less
tragical
associations
it
is
light
and
lofty
exquisitely
graceful
in
its
architecture
paved
with
white
marble
and
bears
the
suggestive
name
of
the
hall
of
the
two
sisters
some
destroy
the
romance
of
the
name
by
attributing
it
to
two
enormous
slabs
of
alabaster
which
lie
side
by
side
and
form
a
great
part
of
the
pavement
an
opinion
strongly
supported
by
mateo
ximenes
others
are
disposed
to
give
the
name
a
more
poetical
significance
as
the
vague
memorial
of
moorish
beauties
who
once
graced
this
hall
which
was
evidently
a
part
of
the
royal
harem
this
opinion
i
was
happy
to
find
entertained
by
our
little
guide
dolores
who
pointed
to
a
balcony
over
an
inner
porch
which
gallery
she
had
been
told
belonged
to
the
women
s
apartment
you
see
señor
said
she
it
is
all
grated
and
latticed
like
the
gallery
in
a
convent
chapel
where
the
nuns
hear
mass
for
the
moorish
kings
added
she
indignantly
shut
up
their
wives
just
like
the
latticed
jalousies
in
fact
still
remain
whence
the
beauties
of
the
harem
might
gaze
unseen
upon
the
zambras
and
other
dances
and
entertainments
of
the
hall
below
on
each
side
of
this
hall
are
recesses
or
alcoves
for
ottomans
and
couches
on
which
the
voluptuous
lords
of
the
alhambra
indulged
in
that
dreamy
repose
so
dear
to
the
orientalists
a
cupola
or
lantern
admits
a
tempered
light
from
above
and
a
free
circulation
of
air
while
on
one
side
is
heard
the
refreshing
sound
of
waters
from
the
fountain
of
the
lions
and
on
the
other
side
the
soft
plash
from
the
basin
in
the
garden
of
lindaraxa
it
is
impossible
to
contemplate
this
scene
so
perfectly
oriental
without
feeling
the
early
associations
of
arabian
romance
and
almost
expecting
to
see
the
white
arm
of
some
mysterious
princess
beckoning
from
the
gallery
or
some
dark
eye
sparkling
through
the
lattice
the
abode
of
beauty
is
here
as
if
it
had
been
inhabited
but
yesterday
but
where
are
the
two
sisters
where
the
zoraydas
and
lindaraxas
an
abundant
supply
of
water
brought
from
the
mountains
by
old
moorish
aqueducts
circulates
throughout
the
palace
supplying
its
baths
and
sparkling
in
jets
within
its
halls
or
murmuring
in
channels
along
the
marble
pavements
when
it
has
paid
its
tribute
to
the
royal
pile
and
visited
its
gardens
and
parterres
it
flows
down
the
long
avenue
leading
to
the
city
tinkling
in
rills
gushing
in
fountains
and
maintaining
a
perpetual
verdure
in
those
groves
that
embower
and
beautify
the
whole
hill
of
the
alhambra
those
only
who
have
sojourned
in
the
ardent
climates
of
the
south
can
appreciate
the
delights
of
an
abode
combining
the
breezy
coolness
of
the
mountain
with
the
freshness
and
verdure
of
the
valley
while
the
city
below
pants
with
the
noontide
heat
and
the
parched
vega
trembles
to
the
eye
the
delicate
airs
from
the
sierra
nevada
play
through
these
lofty
halls
bringing
with
them
the
sweetness
of
the
surrounding
gardens
everything
invites
to
that
indolent
repose
the
bliss
of
southern
climes
and
while
the
eye
looks
out
from
shaded
balconies
upon
the
glittering
landscape
the
ear
is
lulled
by
the
rustling
of
groves
and
the
murmur
of
running
streams
i
forbear
for
the
present
however
to
describe
the
other
delightful
apartments
of
the
palace
my
object
is
merely
to
give
the
reader
a
general
introduction
into
an
abode
where
if
so
disposed
he
may
linger
and
loiter
with
me
day
by
day
until
we
gradually
become
familiar
with
all
its
localities
note
on
morisco
architecture
to
an
unpractised
eye
the
light
relievos
and
fanciful
arabesques
which
cover
the
walls
of
the
alhambra
appear
to
have
been
sculptured
by
the
hand
with
a
minute
and
patient
labor
an
inexhaustible
variety
of
detail
yet
a
general
uniformity
and
harmony
of
design
truly
astonishing
and
this
may
especially
be
said
of
the
vaults
and
cupolas
which
are
wrought
like
or
frostwork
with
stalactites
and
pendants
which
confound
the
beholder
with
the
seeming
intricacy
of
their
patterns
the
astonishment
ceases
however
when
it
is
discovered
that
this
is
all
plates
of
plaster
of
paris
cast
in
moulds
and
skilfully
joined
so
as
to
form
patterns
of
every
size
and
form
this
mode
of
diapering
walls
with
arabesques
and
stuccoing
the
vaults
with
was
invented
in
damascus
but
highly
improved
by
the
moors
in
morocco
to
whom
saracenic
architecture
owes
its
most
graceful
and
fanciful
details
the
process
by
which
all
this
fairy
tracery
was
produced
was
ingeniously
simple
the
wall
in
its
naked
state
was
divided
off
by
lines
crossing
at
right
angles
such
as
artists
use
in
copying
a
picture
over
these
were
drawn
a
succession
of
intersecting
segments
of
circles
by
the
aid
of
these
the
artists
could
work
with
celerity
and
certainty
and
from
the
mere
intersection
of
the
plain
and
curved
lines
arose
the
interminable
variety
of
patterns
and
the
general
uniformity
of
their
character
much
gilding
was
used
in
the
especially
of
the
cupolas
and
the
interstices
were
delicately
pencilled
with
brilliant
colors
such
as
vermilion
and
lapis
lazuli
laid
on
with
the
whites
of
eggs
the
primitive
colors
alone
were
used
says
ford
by
the
egyptians
greeks
and
arabs
in
the
early
period
of
art
and
they
prevail
in
the
alhambra
whenever
the
artist
has
been
arabic
or
moorish
it
is
remarkable
how
much
of
their
original
brilliancy
remains
after
the
lapse
of
several
centuries
the
lower
part
of
the
walls
in
the
saloons
to
the
height
of
several
feet
is
incrusted
with
glazed
tiles
joined
like
the
plates
of
so
as
to
form
various
patterns
on
some
of
them
are
emblazoned
the
escutcheons
of
the
moslem
kings
traversed
with
a
band
and
motto
these
glazed
tiles
azulejos
in
spanish
in
arabic
are
of
oriental
origin
their
coolness
cleanliness
and
freedom
from
vermin
render
them
admirably
fitted
in
sultry
climates
for
paving
halls
and
fountains
incrusting
and
lining
the
walls
of
chambers
ford
is
inclined
to
give
them
great
antiquity
from
their
prevailing
colors
sapphire
and
blue
he
deduces
that
they
may
have
formed
the
kind
of
pavements
alluded
to
in
the
sacred
scriptures
there
was
under
his
feet
as
it
were
a
paved

isaiah
liv
these
glazed
or
porcelain
tiles
were
introduced
into
spain
at
an
early
date
by
the
moslems
some
are
to
be
seen
among
the
moorish
ruins
which
have
been
there
upwards
of
eight
centuries
manufactures
of
them
still
exist
in
the
peninsula
and
they
are
much
used
in
the
best
spanish
houses
especially
in
the
southern
provinces
for
paving
and
lining
the
summer
apartments
the
spaniards
introduced
them
into
the
netherlands
when
they
had
possession
of
that
country
the
people
of
holland
adopted
them
with
avidity
as
wonderfully
suited
to
their
passion
for
household
cleanliness
and
thus
these
oriental
inventions
the
azulejos
of
the

of
the
arabs
have
come
to
be
commonly
known
as
dutch
tiles
important

throne
of
boabdil
the
day
was
nearly
spent
before
we
could
tear
ourself
from
this
region
of
poetry
and
romance
to
descend
to
the
city
and
return
to
the
forlorn
realities
of
a
spanish
posada
in
a
visit
of
ceremony
to
the
governor
of
the
alhambra
to
whom
we
had
brought
letters
we
dwelt
with
enthusiasm
on
the
scenes
we
had
witnessed
and
could
not
but
express
surprise
that
he
should
reside
in
the
city
when
he
had
such
a
paradise
at
his
command
he
pleaded
the
inconvenience
of
a
residence
in
the
palace
from
its
situation
on
the
crest
of
a
hill
distant
from
the
seat
of
business
and
the
resorts
of
social
intercourse
it
did
very
well
for
monarchs
who
often
had
need
of
castle
walls
to
defend
them
from
their
own
subjects
but
señors
added
he
smiling
if
you
think
a
residence
there
so
desirable
my
apartments
in
the
alhambra
are
at
your
it
is
a
common
and
almost
indispensable
point
of
politeness
in
a
spaniard
to
tell
you
his
house
is
esta
casa
es
siempre
à
la
disposicion
de
this
house
is
always
at
the
command
of
your
in
fact
anything
of
his
which
you
admire
is
immediately
offered
to
you
it
is
equally
a
mark
of
good
breeding
in
you
not
to
accept
it
so
we
merely
bowed
our
acknowledgments
of
the
courtesy
of
the
governor
in
offering
us
a
royal
palace
we
were
mistaken
however
the
governor
was
in
earnest
you
will
find
a
rambling
set
of
empty
unfurnished
rooms
said
he
but
tia
antonia
who
has
charge
of
the
palace
may
be
able
to
put
them
in
some
kind
of
order
and
to
take
care
of
you
while
you
are
there
if
you
can
make
any
arrangement
with
her
for
your
accommodation
and
are
content
with
scanty
fare
in
a
royal
abode
the
palace
of
king
chico
is
at
your
we
took
the
governor
at
his
word
and
hastened
up
the
steep
calle
de
los
gomeres
and
through
the
great
gate
of
justice
to
negotiate
with
dame
antonia
doubting
at
times
if
this
were
not
a
dream
and
fearing
at
times
that
the
sage
dueña
of
the
fortress
might
be
slow
to
capitulate
we
knew
we
had
one
friend
at
least
in
the
garrison
who
would
be
in
our
favor
the
little
dolores
whose
good
graces
we
had
propitiated
on
our
first
visit
and
who
hailed
our
return
to
the
palace
with
her
brightest
looks
all
however
went
smoothly
the
good
tia
antonia
had
a
little
furniture
to
put
in
the
rooms
but
it
was
of
the
commonest
kind
we
assured
her
we
could
bivouac
on
the
floor
she
could
supply
our
table
but
only
in
her
own
simple
way
we
wanted
nothing
better
her
niece
dolores
would
wait
upon
us
and
at
the
word
we
threw
up
our
hats
and
the
bargain
was
complete
the
very
next
day
we
took
up
our
abode
in
the
palace
and
never
did
sovereigns
share
a
divided
throne
with
more
perfect
harmony
several
days
passed
by
like
a
dream
when
my
worthy
associate
being
summoned
to
madrid
on
diplomatic
duties
was
compelled
to
abdicate
leaving
me
sole
monarch
of
this
shadowy
realm
for
myself
being
in
a
manner
a
loiterer
about
the
world
and
prone
to
linger
in
its
pleasant
places
here
have
i
been
suffering
day
by
day
to
steal
away
unheeded
for
aught
i
know
in
this
old
enchanted
pile
having
always
a
companionable
feeling
for
my
reader
and
being
prone
to
live
with
him
on
confidential
terms
i
shall
make
it
a
point
to
communicate
to
him
my
reveries
and
researches
during
this
state
of
delicious
thraldom
if
they
have
the
power
of
imparting
to
his
imagination
any
of
the
witching
charms
of
the
place
he
will
not
repine
at
lingering
with
me
for
a
season
in
the
legendary
halls
of
the
alhambra
and
first
it
is
proper
to
give
him
some
idea
of
my
domestic
arrangements
they
are
rather
of
a
simple
kind
for
the
occupant
of
a
regal
palace
but
i
trust
they
will
be
less
liable
to
disastrous
reverses
than
those
of
my
royal
predecessors
my
quarters
are
at
one
end
of
the
governor
s
apartment
a
suite
of
empty
chambers
in
front
of
the
palace
looking
out
upon
the
great
esplanade
called
plaza
de
los
the
place
of
the
cisterns
the
apartment
is
modern
but
the
end
opposite
to
my
communicates
with
a
cluster
of
little
chambers
partly
moorish
partly
spanish
allotted
to
the
doña
antonia
and
her
family
in
consideration
of
keeping
the
palace
in
order
the
good
dame
is
allowed
all
the
perquisites
received
from
visitors
and
all
the
produce
of
the
gardens
excepting
that
she
is
expected
to
pay
an
occasional
tribute
of
fruits
and
flowers
to
the
governor
her
family
consists
of
a
nephew
and
niece
the
children
of
two
different
brothers
the
nephew
manuel
molina
is
a
young
man
of
sterling
worth
and
spanish
gravity
he
had
served
in
the
army
both
in
spain
and
the
west
indies
but
is
now
studying
medicine
in
the
hope
of
one
day
or
other
becoming
physician
to
the
fortress
a
post
worth
at
least
one
hundred
and
forty
dollars
a
year
the
niece
is
the
plump
little
dolores
already
mentioned
and
who
it
is
said
will
one
day
inherit
all
her
aunt
s
possessions
consisting
of
certain
petty
tenements
in
the
fortress
in
a
somewhat
ruinous
condition
it
is
true
but
which
i
am
privately
assured
by
mateo
ximenes
yield
a
revenue
of
nearly
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
so
that
she
is
quite
an
heiress
in
the
eyes
of
the
ragged
son
of
the
alhambra
i
am
also
informed
by
the
same
observant
and
authentic
personage
that
a
quiet
courtship
is
going
on
between
the
discreet
manuel
and
his
cousin
and
that
nothing
is
wanting
to
enable
them
to
join
their
hands
and
expectations
but
his
doctor
s
diploma
and
a
dispensation
from
the
pope
on
account
of
their
consanguinity
the
good
dame
antonia
fulfils
faithfully
her
contract
in
regard
to
my
board
and
lodging
and
as
i
am
easily
pleased
i
find
my
fare
excellent
while
the
little
dolores
keeps
my
apartment
in
order
and
officiates
as
handmaid
at
i
have
also
at
my
command
a
tall
stuttering
lad
named
pépe
who
works
in
the
gardens
and
would
fain
have
acted
as
valet
but
in
this
he
was
forestalled
by
mateo
ximenes
the
son
of
the
this
alert
and
officious
wight
has
managed
somehow
or
other
to
stick
by
me
ever
since
i
first
encountered
him
at
the
outer
gate
of
the
fortress
and
to
weave
himself
into
all
my
plans
until
he
has
fairly
appointed
and
installed
himself
my
valet
cicerone
guide
guard
and
historiographic
squire
and
i
have
been
obliged
to
improve
the
state
of
his
wardrobe
that
he
may
not
disgrace
his
various
functions
so
that
he
has
cast
his
old
brown
mantle
as
a
snake
does
his
skin
and
now
appears
about
the
fortress
with
a
smart
andalusian
hat
and
jacket
to
his
infinite
satisfaction
and
the
great
astonishment
of
his
comrades
the
chief
fault
of
honest
mateo
is
an
to
be
useful
conscious
of
having
foisted
himself
into
my
employ
and
that
my
simple
and
quiet
habits
render
his
situation
a
sinecure
he
is
at
his
wit
s
ends
to
devise
modes
of
making
himself
important
to
my
welfare
i
am
in
a
manner
the
victim
of
his
officiousness
i
can
not
put
my
foot
over
the
threshold
of
the
palace
to
stroll
about
the
fortress
but
he
is
at
my
elbow
to
explain
everything
i
see
and
if
i
venture
to
ramble
among
the
surrounding
hills
he
insists
upon
attending
me
as
a
guard
though
i
vehemently
suspect
he
would
be
more
apt
to
trust
to
the
length
of
his
legs
than
the
strength
of
his
arms
in
case
of
attack
after
all
however
the
poor
fellow
is
at
times
an
amusing
companion
he
is
and
of
infinite
with
the
loquacity
and
gossip
of
a
village
barber
and
knows
all
the
of
the
place
and
its
environs
but
what
he
chiefly
values
himself
on
is
his
stock
of
local
information
having
the
most
marvellous
stories
to
relate
of
every
tower
and
vault
and
gateway
of
the
fortress
in
all
of
which
he
places
the
most
implicit
faith
most
of
these
he
has
derived
according
to
his
own
account
from
his
grandfather
a
little
legendary
tailor
who
lived
to
the
age
of
nearly
a
hundred
years
during
which
he
made
but
two
migrations
beyond
the
precincts
of
the
fortress
his
sloop
for
the
greater
part
of
a
century
was
the
resort
of
a
knot
of
venerable
gossips
where
they
would
pass
half
the
night
talking
about
old
times
and
the
wonderful
events
and
hidden
secrets
of
the
place
the
whole
living
moving
thinking
and
acting
of
this
historical
little
tailor
had
thus
been
bounded
by
the
walls
of
the
alhambra
within
them
he
had
been
born
within
them
he
lived
breathed
and
had
his
being
within
them
he
died
and
was
buried
fortunately
for
posterity
his
traditionary
lore
died
not
with
him
the
authentic
mateo
when
an
urchin
used
to
be
an
attentive
listener
to
the
narratives
of
his
grandfather
and
of
the
gossiping
group
assembled
round
the
shopboard
and
is
thus
possessed
of
a
stock
of
valuable
knowledge
concerning
the
alhambra
not
to
be
found
in
books
and
well
worthy
the
attention
of
every
curious
traveller
such
are
the
personages
that
constitute
my
regal
household
and
i
question
whether
any
of
the
potentates
moslem
or
christian
who
have
preceded
me
in
the
palace
have
been
waited
upon
with
greater
fidelity
or
enjoyed
a
serener
sway
when
i
rise
in
the
morning
pépe
the
stuttering
lad
from
the
gardens
brings
me
a
tribute
of
flowers
which
are
afterwards
arranged
in
vases
by
the
skilful
hand
of
dolores
who
takes
a
feminine
pride
in
the
decoration
of
my
chambers
my
meals
are
made
wherever
caprice
dictates
sometimes
in
one
of
the
moorish
halls
sometimes
under
the
arcades
of
the
court
of
lions
surrounded
by
flowers
and
fountains
and
when
i
walk
out
i
am
conducted
by
the
assiduous
mateo
to
the
most
romantic
retreats
of
the
mountains
and
delicious
haunts
of
the
adjacent
valleys
not
one
of
which
but
is
the
scene
of
some
wonderful
tale
though
fond
of
passing
the
greater
part
of
my
day
alone
yet
i
occasionally
repair
in
the
evenings
to
the
little
domestic
circle
of
doña
antonia
this
is
generally
held
in
an
old
moorish
chamber
which
serves
the
good
dame
for
parlor
kitchen
and
hall
of
audience
and
which
must
have
boasted
of
some
splendor
in
the
time
of
the
moors
if
we
may
judge
from
the
traces
yet
remaining
but
a
rude
fireplace
has
been
made
in
modern
times
in
one
corner
the
smoke
from
which
has
discolored
the
walls
and
almost
obliterated
the
ancient
arabesques
a
window
with
a
balcony
overhanging
the
valley
of
the
darro
lets
in
the
cool
evening
breeze
and
here
i
take
my
frugal
supper
of
fruit
and
milk
and
mingle
with
the
conversation
of
the
family
there
is
a
natural
talent
or
as
it
is
called
about
the
spaniards
which
renders
them
intellectual
and
agreeable
companions
whatever
may
be
their
condition
in
life
or
however
imperfect
may
have
been
their
education
add
to
this
they
are
never
vulgar
nature
has
endowed
them
with
an
inherent
dignity
of
spirit
the
good
tia
antonia
is
a
woman
of
strong
and
intelligent
though
uncultivated
mind
and
the
dolores
though
she
has
read
but
three
or
four
books
in
the
whole
course
of
her
life
has
an
engaging
mixture
of
naïveté
and
good
sense
and
often
surprises
me
by
the
pungency
of
her
artless
sallies
sometimes
the
nephew
entertains
us
by
reading
some
old
comedy
of
calderon
or
lope
de
vega
to
which
he
is
evidently
prompted
by
a
desire
to
improve
as
well
as
amuse
his
cousin
dolores
though
to
his
great
mortification
the
little
damsel
generally
falls
asleep
before
the
first
act
is
completed
sometimes
tia
antonia
has
a
little
levee
of
humble
friends
and
dependants
the
inhabitants
of
the
adjacent
hamlet
or
the
wives
of
the
invalid
soldiers
these
look
up
to
her
with
great
deference
as
the
custodian
of
the
palace
and
pay
their
court
to
her
by
bringing
the
news
of
the
place
or
the
rumors
that
may
have
straggled
up
from
granada
in
listening
to
these
evening
gossipings
i
have
picked
up
many
curious
facts
illustrative
of
the
manners
of
the
people
and
the
peculiarities
of
the
neighborhood
these
are
simple
details
of
simple
pleasures
it
is
the
nature
of
the
place
alone
that
gives
them
interest
and
importance
i
tread
haunted
ground
and
am
surrounded
by
romantic
associations
from
earliest
boyhood
when
on
the
banks
of
the
hudson
i
first
pored
over
the
pages
of
old
gines
perez
de
hytas
s
apocryphal
but
chivalresque
history
of
the
civil
wars
of
granada
and
the
feuds
of
its
gallant
cavaliers
the
zegries
and
abencerrages
that
city
has
ever
been
a
subject
of
my
waking
dreams
and
often
have
i
trod
in
fancy
the
romantic
halls
of
the
alhambra
behold
for
once
a
realized
yet
i
can
scarce
credit
my
senses
or
believe
that
i
do
indeed
inhabit
the
palace
of
boabdil
and
look
down
from
its
balconies
upon
chivalric
granada
as
i
loiter
through
these
oriental
chambers
and
hear
the
murmur
of
fountains
and
the
song
of
the
nightingale
as
i
inhale
the
odor
of
the
rose
and
feel
the
influence
of
the
balmy
climate
i
am
almost
tempted
to
fancy
myself
in
the
paradise
of
mahomet
and
that
the
plump
little
dolores
is
one
of
the
houris
destined
to
administer
to
the
happiness
of
true
believers
inhabitants
of
the
alhambra
i
have
often
observed
that
the
more
proudly
a
mansion
has
been
tenanted
in
the
day
of
its
prosperity
the
humbler
are
its
inhabitants
in
the
day
of
its
decline
and
that
the
palace
of
a
king
commonly
ends
in
being
the
of
the
beggar
the
alhambra
is
in
a
rapid
state
of
similar
transition
whenever
a
tower
falls
to
decay
it
is
seized
upon
by
some
tatterdemalion
family
who
become
with
the
bats
and
owls
of
its
gilded
halls
and
hang
their
rags
those
standards
of
poverty
out
of
its
windows
and
loopholes
i
have
amused
myself
with
remarking
some
of
the
motley
characters
that
have
thus
usurped
the
ancient
abode
of
royalty
and
who
seem
as
if
placed
here
to
give
a
farcical
termination
to
the
drama
of
human
pride
one
of
these
even
bears
the
mockery
of
a
regal
title
it
is
a
little
old
woman
named
maria
antonia
sabonea
but
who
goes
by
the
appellation
of
la
reyna
coquina
or
the
she
is
small
enough
to
be
a
fairy
and
a
fairy
she
may
be
for
aught
i
can
find
out
for
no
one
seems
to
know
her
origin
her
habitation
is
in
a
kind
of
closet
under
the
outer
staircase
of
the
palace
and
she
sits
in
the
cool
stone
corridor
plying
her
needle
and
singing
from
morning
till
night
with
a
ready
joke
for
every
one
that
passes
for
though
one
of
the
poorest
she
is
one
of
the
merriest
little
women
breathing
her
great
merit
is
a
gift
for
having
i
verily
believe
as
many
stories
at
her
command
as
the
inexhaustible
scheherezade
of
the
thousand
and
one
nights
some
of
these
i
have
heard
her
relate
in
the
evening
tertulias
of
dame
antonia
at
which
she
is
occasionally
a
humble
attendant
that
there
must
be
some
fairy
gift
about
this
mysterious
little
old
woman
would
appear
from
her
extraordinary
luck
since
notwithstanding
her
being
very
little
very
ugly
and
very
poor
she
has
had
according
to
her
own
account
five
husbands
and
a
half
reckoning
as
a
half
one
a
young
dragoon
who
died
during
courtship
a
rival
personage
to
this
little
fairy
queen
is
a
portly
old
fellow
with
a
who
goes
about
in
a
rusty
garb
with
a
cocked
hat
of
and
a
red
cockade
he
is
one
of
the
legitimate
sons
of
the
alhambra
and
has
lived
here
all
his
life
filling
various
offices
such
as
deputy
alguazil
sexton
of
the
parochial
church
and
marker
of
a
established
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
towers
he
is
as
poor
as
a
rat
but
as
proud
as
he
is
ragged
boasting
of
his
descent
from
the
illustrious
house
of
aguilar
from
which
sprang
gonzalvo
of
cordova
the
grand
captain
nay
he
actually
bears
the
name
of
alonzo
de
aguilar
so
renowned
in
the
history
of
the
conquest
though
the
graceless
wags
of
the
fortress
have
given
him
the
title
of
padre
or
the
holy
father
the
usual
appellation
of
the
pope
which
i
had
thought
too
sacred
in
the
eyes
of
true
catholics
to
be
thus
ludicrously
applied
it
is
a
whimsical
caprice
of
fortune
to
present
in
the
grotesque
person
of
this
tatterdemalion
a
namesake
and
descendant
of
the
proud
alonzo
de
aguilar
the
mirror
of
andalusian
chivalry
leading
an
almost
mendicant
existence
about
this
once
haughty
fortress
which
his
ancestor
aided
to
reduce
yet
such
might
have
been
the
lot
of
the
descendants
of
agamemnon
and
achilles
had
they
lingered
about
the
ruins
of
troy
of
this
motley
community
i
find
the
family
of
my
gossiping
squire
mateo
ximenes
to
form
from
their
numbers
at
least
a
very
important
part
his
boast
of
being
a
son
of
the
alhambra
is
not
unfounded
his
family
has
inhabited
the
fortress
ever
since
the
time
of
the
conquest
handing
down
an
hereditary
poverty
from
father
to
son
not
one
of
them
having
ever
been
known
to
be
worth
a
maravedi
his
father
by
trade
a
and
who
succeeded
the
historical
tailor
as
the
head
of
the
family
is
now
near
seventy
years
of
age
and
lives
in
a
hovel
of
reeds
and
plaster
built
by
his
own
hands
just
above
the
iron
gate
the
furniture
consists
of
a
crazy
bed
a
table
and
two
or
three
chairs
a
wooden
chest
containing
besides
his
scanty
clothing
the
archives
of
the
these
are
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
papers
of
various
sustained
by
different
generations
by
which
it
would
seem
that
with
all
their
apparent
carelessness
and
they
are
a
litigious
brood
most
of
the
suits
have
been
brought
against
gossiping
neighbors
for
questioning
the
purity
of
their
blood
and
denying
their
being
old
christians
without
jewish
or
moorish
taint
in
fact
i
doubt
whether
this
jealousy
about
their
blood
has
not
kept
them
so
poor
in
purse
spending
all
their
earnings
on
escribanos
and
alguazils
the
pride
of
the
hovel
is
an
escutcheon
suspended
against
the
wall
in
which
are
emblazoned
quarterings
of
the
arms
of
the
marquis
of
caiesedo
and
of
various
other
noble
houses
with
which
this
brood
claim
affinity
as
to
mateo
himself
who
is
now
about
years
of
age
he
has
done
his
utmost
to
perpetuate
his
line
and
continue
the
poverty
of
the
family
having
a
wife
and
a
numerous
progeny
who
inhabit
an
almost
dismantled
hovel
in
the
hamlet
how
they
manage
to
subsist
he
only
who
sees
into
all
mysteries
can
tell
the
subsistence
of
a
spanish
family
of
the
kind
is
always
a
riddle
to
me
yet
they
do
subsist
and
what
is
more
appear
to
enjoy
their
existence
the
wife
takes
her
holiday
stroll
on
the
paseo
of
granada
with
a
child
in
her
arms
and
half
a
dozen
at
her
heels
and
the
eldest
daughter
now
verging
into
womanhood
dresses
her
hair
with
flowers
and
dances
gayly
to
the
castanets
there
are
two
classes
of
people
to
whom
life
seems
one
long
holiday
the
very
rich
and
the
very
poor
one
because
they
need
do
nothing
the
other
because
they
have
nothing
to
do
but
there
are
none
who
understand
the
art
of
doing
nothing
and
living
upon
nothing
better
than
the
poor
classes
of
spain
climate
does
one
half
and
temperament
the
rest
give
a
spaniard
the
shade
in
summer
and
the
sun
in
winter
a
little
bread
garlic
oil
and
garbances
an
old
brown
cloak
and
a
guitar
and
let
the
world
roll
on
as
it
pleases
talk
of
poverty
with
him
it
has
no
disgrace
it
sits
upon
him
with
a
grandiose
style
like
his
ragged
cloak
he
is
a
hidalgo
even
when
in
rags
the
sons
of
the
alhambra
are
an
eminent
illustration
of
this
practical
philosophy
as
the
moors
imagined
that
the
celestial
paradise
hung
over
this
favored
spot
so
i
am
inclined
at
times
to
fancy
that
a
gleam
of
the
golden
age
still
lingers
about
this
ragged
community
they
possess
nothing
they
do
nothing
they
care
for
nothing
yet
though
apparently
idle
all
the
week
they
are
as
observant
of
all
holy
days
and
saints
days
as
the
most
laborious
artisan
they
attend
all
fêtes
and
dancings
in
granada
and
its
vicinity
light
bonfires
on
the
hills
on
john
s
eve
and
dance
away
the
moonlight
nights
on
the
of
a
small
field
within
the
precincts
of
the
fortress
which
yield
a
few
bushels
of
wheat
before
concluding
these
remarks
i
must
mention
one
of
the
amusements
of
the
place
which
has
particularly
struck
me
i
had
repeatedly
observed
a
long
lean
fellow
perched
on
the
top
of
one
of
the
towers
manœuvring
two
or
three
as
though
he
were
angling
for
the
stars
i
was
for
some
time
perplexed
by
the
evolutions
of
this
aërial
fisherman
and
my
perplexity
increased
on
observing
others
employed
in
like
manner
on
different
parts
of
the
battlements
and
bastions
it
was
not
until
i
consulted
mateo
ximenes
that
i
solved
the
mystery
it
seems
that
the
pure
and
airy
situation
of
this
fortress
has
rendered
it
like
the
castle
of
macbeth
a
prolific
for
swallows
and
martlets
who
sport
about
its
towers
in
myriads
with
the
holiday
glee
of
urchins
just
let
loose
from
school
to
entrap
these
birds
in
their
giddy
circlings
with
hooks
baited
with
flies
is
one
of
the
favorite
amusements
of
the
ragged
sons
of
the
alhambra
who
with
the
ingenuity
of
arrant
idlers
have
thus
invented
the
art
of
angling
in
the
sky
the
hall
of
ambassadors
in
one
of
my
visits
to
the
old
moorish
chamber
where
the
good
tia
antonia
cooks
her
dinner
and
receives
her
company
i
observed
a
mysterious
door
in
one
corner
leading
apparently
into
the
ancient
part
of
the
edifice
my
curiosity
being
aroused
i
opened
it
and
found
myself
in
a
narrow
blind
corridor
groping
along
which
i
came
to
the
head
of
a
dark
winding
staircase
leading
down
an
angle
of
the
tower
of
comares
down
this
staircase
i
descended
darkling
illustration
entrance
to
the
hall
of
ambassadors
guiding
myself
by
the
wall
until
i
came
to
a
small
door
at
the
bottom
throwing
which
open
i
was
suddenly
dazzled
by
emerging
into
the
brilliant
antechamber
of
the
hall
of
ambassadors
with
the
fountain
of
the
court
of
the
alberca
sparkling
before
me
the
antechamber
is
separated
from
the
court
by
an
elegant
gallery
supported
by
slender
columns
with
spandrels
of
open
work
in
the
morisco
style
at
each
end
of
the
antechamber
are
alcoves
and
its
ceiling
is
richly
stuccoed
and
painted
passing
through
a
magnificent
portal
i
found
myself
in
the
hall
of
ambassadors
the
audience
chamber
of
the
moslem
monarchs
it
is
said
to
be
feet
square
and
sixty
feet
high
occupies
the
whole
interior
of
the
tower
of
comares
and
still
bears
the
traces
of
past
magnificence
the
walls
are
beautifully
stuccoed
and
decorated
with
morisco
fancifulness
the
lofty
ceiling
was
originally
of
the
same
favorite
material
with
the
usual
frostwork
and
pensile
ornaments
or
stalactites
which
with
the
embellishments
of
vivid
coloring
and
gilding
must
have
been
gorgeous
in
the
extreme
unfortunately
it
gave
way
during
an
earthquake
and
brought
down
with
it
an
immense
arch
which
traversed
the
hall
it
was
replaced
by
the
present
vault
or
dome
of
larch
or
cedar
with
intersecting
ribs
the
whole
curiously
wrought
and
richly
colored
still
oriental
in
its
character
reminding
one
of
those
ceilings
of
cedar
and
vermilion
that
we
read
of
in
the
prophets
and
the
arabian
from
the
great
height
of
the
vault
above
the
windows
the
upper
part
of
the
hall
is
almost
lost
in
obscurity
yet
there
is
a
magnificence
as
well
as
solemnity
in
the
gloom
as
through
it
we
have
gleams
of
rich
gilding
and
the
brilliant
tints
of
the
moorish
pencil
the
royal
throne
was
placed
opposite
the
entrance
in
a
recess
which
still
bears
an
inscription
intimating
that
yusef
i
the
monarch
who
completed
the
alhambra
made
this
the
throne
of
his
empire
everything
in
this
noble
hall
seems
to
have
been
calculated
to
surround
the
throne
with
impressive
dignity
and
splendor
there
was
none
of
the
elegant
voluptuousness
which
reigns
in
other
parts
of
the
palace
the
tower
is
of
massive
strength
domineering
over
the
whole
edifice
and
overhanging
the
steep
on
three
sides
of
the
hall
of
ambassadors
are
windows
cut
through
the
immense
thickness
of
the
walls
and
commanding
extensive
prospects
the
balcony
of
the
central
window
especially
looks
down
upon
the
verdant
valley
of
the
darro
with
its
walks
its
groves
and
gardens
to
the
left
it
enjoys
a
distant
prospect
of
the
vega
while
directly
in
front
rises
the
rival
height
of
the
albaycin
with
its
medley
of
streets
and
terraces
and
gardens
and
once
crowned
by
a
fortress
that
vied
in
power
with
the
alhambra
ill
fated
the
man
who
lost
all
this
exclaimed
charles
as
he
looked
forth
from
this
window
upon
the
enchanting
scenery
it
commands
the
balcony
of
the
window
where
this
royal
exclamation
was
made
has
of
late
become
one
of
my
favorite
resorts
i
have
just
been
seated
there
enjoying
the
close
of
a
long
brilliant
day
the
sun
as
he
sank
behind
the
purple
mountains
of
alhama
sent
a
stream
of
effulgence
up
the
valley
of
the
darro
that
spread
a
melancholy
pomp
over
the
ruddy
towers
of
the
alhambra
while
the
vega
covered
with
a
slight
sultry
vapor
that
caught
the
setting
ray
seemed
spread
out
in
the
distance
like
a
golden
sea
not
a
breath
of
air
disturbed
the
stillness
of
the
hour
and
though
the
faint
sound
of
music
and
merriment
now
and
then
rose
from
the
gardens
of
the
darro
it
but
rendered
more
impressive
the
monumental
silence
of
the
pile
which
overshadowed
me
it
was
one
of
those
hours
and
scenes
in
which
memory
asserts
an
almost
magical
power
and
like
the
evening
sun
beaming
on
these
mouldering
towers
sends
back
her
retrospective
rays
to
light
up
the
glories
of
the
past
as
i
sat
watching
the
effect
of
the
declining
daylight
upon
this
moorish
pile
i
was
led
into
a
consideration
of
the
light
elegant
and
voluptuous
character
prevalent
throughout
its
internal
architecture
and
to
contrast
it
with
the
grand
but
gloomy
solemnity
of
the
gothic
edifices
reared
by
the
spanish
conquerors
the
very
architecture
thus
bespeaks
the
opposite
and
irreconcilable
natures
of
the
two
warlike
people
who
so
long
battled
here
for
the
mastery
of
the
peninsula
by
degrees
i
fell
into
a
course
of
musing
upon
the
singular
fortunes
of
the
arabian
or
whose
whole
existence
is
as
a
tale
that
is
told
and
certainly
forms
one
of
the
most
anomalous
yet
splendid
episodes
in
history
potent
and
durable
as
was
their
dominion
we
scarcely
know
how
to
call
them
they
were
a
nation
without
a
legitimate
country
or
name
a
remote
wave
of
the
great
arabian
inundation
cast
upon
the
shores
of
europe
they
seem
to
have
all
the
impetus
of
the
first
rush
of
the
torrent
their
career
of
conquest
from
the
rock
of
gibraltar
to
the
cliffs
of
the
pyrenees
was
as
rapid
and
brilliant
as
the
moslem
victories
of
syria
and
egypt
nay
had
they
not
been
checked
on
the
plains
of
tours
all
france
all
europe
might
have
been
overrun
with
the
same
facility
as
the
empires
of
the
east
and
the
crescent
at
this
day
have
glittered
on
the
fanes
of
paris
and
london
repelled
within
the
limits
of
the
pyrenees
the
mixed
hordes
of
asia
and
africa
that
formed
this
great
irruption
gave
up
the
moslem
principle
of
conquest
and
sought
to
establish
in
spain
a
peaceful
and
permanent
dominion
as
conquerors
their
heroism
was
only
equalled
by
their
moderation
and
in
both
for
a
time
they
excelled
the
nations
with
whom
they
contended
severed
from
their
native
homes
they
loved
the
land
given
them
as
they
supposed
by
allah
and
strove
to
embellish
it
with
everything
that
could
administer
to
the
happiness
of
man
laying
the
foundations
of
their
power
in
a
system
of
wise
and
equitable
laws
diligently
cultivating
the
arts
and
sciences
and
promoting
agriculture
manufactures
and
commerce
they
gradually
formed
an
empire
unrivalled
for
its
prosperity
by
any
of
the
empires
of
christendom
and
diligently
drawing
round
them
the
graces
and
refinements
which
marked
the
arabian
empire
in
the
east
at
the
time
of
its
greatest
civilization
they
diffused
the
light
of
oriental
knowledge
through
the
western
regions
of
benighted
europe
the
cities
of
arabian
spain
became
the
resort
of
christian
artisans
to
instruct
themselves
in
the
useful
arts
the
universities
of
toledo
cordova
seville
and
granada
were
sought
by
the
pale
student
from
other
lands
to
acquaint
himself
with
the
sciences
of
the
arabs
and
the
treasured
lore
of
antiquity
the
lovers
of
the
gay
science
resorted
to
cordova
and
granada
to
imbibe
the
poetry
and
music
of
the
east
and
the
warriors
of
the
north
hastened
thither
to
accomplish
themselves
in
the
graceful
exercises
and
courteous
usages
of
chivalry
if
the
moslem
monuments
in
spain
if
the
mosque
of
cordova
the
alcazar
of
seville
and
the
alhambra
of
granada
still
bear
inscriptions
fondly
boasting
of
the
power
and
permanency
of
their
dominion
can
the
boast
be
derided
as
arrogant
and
vain
generation
after
generation
century
after
century
passed
away
and
still
they
maintained
possession
of
the
land
a
period
elapsed
longer
than
that
which
has
passed
since
england
was
subjugated
by
the
norman
conqueror
and
the
descendants
of
musa
and
taric
might
as
little
anticipate
being
driven
into
exile
across
the
same
straits
traversed
by
their
triumphant
ancestors
as
the
descendants
of
rollo
and
william
and
their
veteran
peers
may
dream
of
being
driven
back
to
the
shores
of
normandy
with
all
this
however
the
moslem
empire
in
spain
was
but
a
brilliant
exotic
that
took
no
permanent
root
in
the
soil
it
embellished
severed
from
all
their
neighbors
in
the
west
by
impassable
barriers
of
faith
and
manners
and
separated
by
seas
and
deserts
from
their
kindred
of
the
east
the
were
an
isolated
people
their
whole
existence
was
a
prolonged
though
gallant
and
chivalric
struggle
for
a
foothold
in
a
usurped
land
they
were
the
outposts
and
frontiers
of
islamism
the
peninsula
was
the
great
where
the
gothic
conquerors
of
the
north
and
the
moslem
conquerors
of
the
east
met
and
strove
for
mastery
and
the
fiery
courage
of
the
arab
was
at
length
subdued
by
the
obstinate
and
persevering
valor
of
the
goth
never
was
the
annihilation
of
a
people
more
complete
than
that
of
the
where
are
they
ask
the
shores
of
barbary
and
its
desert
places
the
exiled
remnant
of
their
once
powerful
empire
disappeared
among
the
barbarians
of
africa
and
ceased
to
be
a
nation
they
have
not
even
left
a
distinct
name
behind
them
though
for
nearly
eight
centuries
they
were
a
distinct
people
the
home
of
their
adoption
and
of
their
occupation
for
ages
refuses
to
acknowledge
them
except
as
invaders
and
usurpers
a
few
broken
monuments
are
all
that
remain
to
bear
witness
to
their
power
and
dominion
as
solitary
rocks
left
far
in
the
interior
bear
testimony
to
the
extent
of
some
vast
inundation
such
is
the
alhambra
a
moslem
pile
in
the
midst
of
a
christian
land
an
oriental
palace
amidst
the
gothic
edifices
of
the
west
an
elegant
memento
of
a
brave
intelligent
and
graceful
people
who
conquered
ruled
flourished
and
passed
away
the
jesuits
library
since
indulging
in
the
foregoing
reverie
my
curiosity
has
been
aroused
to
know
something
of
the
princes
who
left
behind
them
this
monument
of
oriental
taste
and
magnificence
and
whose
names
still
appear
among
the
inscriptions
on
its
walls
to
gratify
this
curiosity
i
have
descended
from
this
region
of
fancy
and
fable
where
everything
is
liable
to
take
an
imaginary
tint
and
have
carried
my
researches
among
the
dusty
tomes
of
the
old
jesuits
library
in
the
university
this
once
boasted
repository
of
erudition
is
now
a
mere
shadow
of
its
former
self
having
been
stripped
of
its
manuscripts
and
rarest
works
by
the
french
when
masters
of
granada
still
it
contains
among
many
ponderous
tomes
of
the
jesuit
fathers
which
the
french
were
careful
to
leave
behind
several
curious
tracts
of
spanish
literature
and
above
all
a
number
of
those
antiquated
chronicles
for
which
i
have
a
particular
veneration
in
this
old
library
i
have
passed
many
delightful
hours
of
quiet
undisturbed
literary
foraging
for
the
keys
of
the
doors
and
bookcases
were
kindly
intrusted
to
me
and
i
was
left
alone
to
rummage
at
my
pleasure
a
rare
indulgence
in
these
sanctuaries
of
learning
which
too
often
tantalize
the
thirsty
student
with
the
sight
of
sealed
fountains
of
knowledge
in
the
course
of
these
visits
i
gleaned
a
variety
of
facts
concerning
historical
characters
connected
with
the
alhambra
some
of
which
i
here
subjoin
trusting
they
may
prove
acceptable
to
the
reader
alhamar
the
founder
of
the
alhambra
the
moors
of
granada
regarded
the
alhambra
as
a
miracle
of
art
and
had
a
tradition
that
the
king
who
founded
it
dealt
in
magic
or
at
least
in
alchemy
by
means
whereof
he
procured
the
immense
sums
of
gold
expended
in
its
erection
a
brief
view
of
his
reign
will
show
the
secret
of
his
wealth
he
is
known
in
arabian
history
as
muhamed
but
his
name
in
general
is
written
simply
alhamar
and
was
given
to
him
we
are
told
on
account
of
his
ruddy
complexion
he
was
of
the
noble
and
opulent
line
of
the
beni
nasar
or
tribe
of
nasar
and
was
born
in
arjona
in
the
year
of
the
hegira
at
his
birth
the
astrologers
we
are
told
cast
his
horoscope
according
to
oriental
custom
and
pronounced
it
highly
auspicious
and
a
santon
predicted
for
him
a
glorious
career
no
expense
was
spared
in
fitting
him
for
the
high
destinies
prognosticated
before
he
attained
the
full
years
of
manhood
the
famous
battle
of
the
navas
or
plains
of
tolosa
shattered
the
moorish
empire
and
eventually
severed
the
moslems
of
spain
from
the
moslems
of
africa
factions
soon
arose
among
the
former
headed
by
warlike
chiefs
ambitious
of
grasping
the
sovereignty
of
the
peninsula
alhamar
became
engaged
in
these
wars
he
was
the
general
and
leader
of
the
beni
nasar
and
as
such
he
opposed
and
thwarted
the
ambition
of
aben
hud
who
had
raised
his
standard
among
the
warlike
mountains
of
the
alpuxaras
and
been
proclaimed
king
of
murcia
and
granada
many
conflicts
took
place
between
these
warring
chieftains
alhamar
dispossessed
his
rival
of
several
important
places
and
was
proclaimed
king
of
jaen
by
his
soldiery
but
he
aspired
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
whole
of
andalusia
for
he
was
of
a
sanguine
spirit
and
lofty
ambition
his
valor
and
generosity
went
hand
in
hand
what
he
gained
by
the
one
he
secured
by
the
other
and
at
the
death
of

he
became
sovereign
of
all
the
territories
which
owed
allegiance
to
that
powerful
chief
he
made
his
formal
entry
into
granada
in
the
same
year
amid
the
enthusiastic
shouts
of
the
multitude
who
hailed
him
as
the
only
one
capable
of
uniting
the
various
factions
which
prevailed
and
which
threatened
to
lay
the
empire
at
the
mercy
of
the
christian
princes
alhamar
established
his
court
in
granada
he
was
the
first
of
the
illustrious
line
of
nasar
that
sat
upon
a
throne
he
took
immediate
measures
to
put
his
little
kingdom
in
a
posture
of
defence
against
the
assaults
to
be
expected
from
his
christian
neighbors
repairing
and
strengthening
the
frontier
posts
and
fortifying
the
capital
not
content
with
the
provisions
of
the
moslem
law
by
which
every
man
is
made
a
soldier
he
raised
a
regular
army
to
garrison
his
strongholds
allowing
every
soldier
stationed
on
the
frontier
a
portion
of
land
for
the
support
of
himself
his
horse
and
his
family
thus
interesting
him
in
the
defence
of
the
soil
in
which
he
had
a
property
these
wise
precautions
were
justified
by
events
the
christians
profiting
by
the
dismemberment
of
the
moslem
power
were
rapidly
regaining
their
ancient
territories
james
the
conqueror
had
subjected
all
valencia
and
ferdinand
the
saint
sat
down
in
person
before
jaen
the
bulwark
of
granada
alhamar
ventured
to
oppose
him
in
open
field
but
met
with
a
signal
defeat
and
retired
discomfited
to
his
capital
jaen
still
held
out
and
kept
the
enemy
at
bay
during
an
entire
winter
but
ferdinand
swore
not
to
raise
his
camp
until
he
had
gained
possession
of
the
place
alhamar
found
it
impossible
to
throw
reinforcements
into
the
besieged
city
he
saw
that
its
fall
must
be
followed
by
the
investment
of
his
capital
and
was
conscious
of
the
insufficiency
of
his
means
to
cope
with
the
potent
sovereign
of
castile
taking
a
sudden
resolution
therefore
he
repaired
privately
to
the
christian
camp
made
his
unexpected
appearance
in
the
presence
of
king
ferdinand
and
frankly
announced
himself
as
the
king
of
granada
i
come
said
he
confiding
in
your
good
faith
to
put
myself
under
your
protection
take
all
i
possess
and
receive
me
as
your
vassal
so
saying
he
knelt
and
kissed
the
king
s
hand
in
token
of
allegiance
ferdinand
was
won
by
this
instance
of
confiding
faith
and
determined
not
to
be
outdone
in
generosity
he
raised
his
late
enemy
from
the
earth
embraced
him
as
a
friend
and
refusing
the
wealth
he
offered
left
him
sovereign
of
his
dominions
under
the
feudal
tenure
of
a
yearly
tribute
attendance
at
the
cortes
as
one
of
the
nobles
of
the
empire
and
service
in
war
with
a
certain
number
of
horsemen
he
moreover
conferred
on
him
the
honor
of
knighthood
and
armed
him
with
his
own
hands
it
was
not
long
after
this
that
alhamar
was
called
upon
for
his
military
services
to
aid
king
ferdinand
in
his
famous
siege
of
seville
the
moorish
king
sallied
forth
with
five
hundred
chosen
horsemen
of
granada
than
whom
none
in
the
world
knew
better
how
to
manage
the
steed
or
wield
the
lance
it
was
a
humiliating
service
however
for
they
had
to
draw
the
sword
against
their
brethren
of
the
faith
alhamar
gained
a
melancholy
distinction
by
his
prowess
in
this
renowned
conquest
but
more
true
honor
by
the
humanity
which
he
prevailed
upon
ferdinand
to
introduce
into
the
usages
of
war
when
in
the
famous
city
of
seville
surrendered
to
the
castilian
monarch
alhamar
returned
sad
and
full
of
care
to
his
dominions
he
saw
the
gathering
ills
that
menaced
the
moslem
cause
and
uttered
an
ejaculation
often
used
by
him
in
moments
of
anxiety
and
trouble
how
straitened
and
wretched
would
be
our
life
if
our
hope
were
not
so
spacious
and
que
angoste
y
miserabile
seria
nuestra
vida
sino
fuera
tan
dilatada
y
espaciosa
nuestra
esperanza
as
he
approached
granada
on
his
return
he
beheld
arches
of
triumph
which
had
been
erected
in
honor
of
his
martial
exploits
the
people
thronged
forth
to
see
him
with
impatient
joy
for
his
benignant
rule
had
won
all
hearts
wherever
he
passed
he
was
hailed
with
acclamations
as
el
ghalib
the
conqueror
alhamar
gave
a
melancholy
shake
of
the
head
on
hearing
the
appellation
le
ghalib
ile
aláh
there
is
no
conqueror
but
god
exclaimed
he
from
that
time
forward
this
exclamation
became
his
motto
and
the
motto
of
his
descendants
and
appears
to
this
day
emblazoned
on
his
escutcheons
in
the
halls
of
the
alhambra
alhamar
had
purchased
peace
by
submission
to
the
christian
yoke
but
he
was
conscious
that
with
elements
so
discordant
and
motives
for
hostility
so
deep
and
ancient
it
could
not
be
permanent
acting
therefore
upon
the
old
maxim
arm
thyself
in
peace
and
clothe
thyself
in
summer
he
improved
the
present
interval
of
tranquillity
by
fortifying
his
dominions
replenishing
his
arsenals
and
promoting
those
useful
arts
which
give
wealth
and
real
power
he
confided
the
command
of
his
various
cities
to
such
as
had
distinguished
themselves
by
valor
and
prudence
and
who
seemed
most
acceptable
to
the
people
he
organized
a
vigilant
police
and
established
rigid
rules
for
the
administration
of
justice
the
poor
and
the
distressed
always
found
ready
admission
to
his
presence
and
he
attended
personally
to
their
assistance
and
redress
he
erected
hospitals
for
the
blind
the
aged
and
infirm
and
all
those
incapable
of
labor
and
visited
them
frequently
not
on
set
days
with
pomp
and
form
so
as
to
give
time
for
everything
to
be
put
in
order
and
every
abuse
concealed
but
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
informing
himself
by
actual
observation
and
close
inquiry
of
the
treatment
of
the
sick
and
the
conduct
of
those
appointed
to
administer
to
their
relief
he
founded
schools
and
colleges
which
he
visited
in
the
same
manner
inspecting
personally
the
instruction
of
the
youth
he
established
butcheries
and
public
ovens
that
the
people
might
be
furnished
with
wholesome
provisions
at
just
and
regular
prices
he
introduced
abundant
streams
of
water
into
the
city
erecting
baths
and
fountains
and
constructing
aqueducts
and
canals
to
irrigate
and
fertilize
the
vega
by
these
means
prosperity
and
abundance
prevailed
in
this
beautiful
city
its
gates
were
thronged
with
commerce
and
its
warehouses
filled
with
luxuries
and
merchandise
of
every
clime
and
country
he
moreover
gave
premiums
and
privileges
to
the
best
artisans
improved
the
breed
of
horses
and
other
domestic
animals
encouraged
husbandry
and
increased
the
natural
fertility
of
the
soil
twofold
by
his
protection
making
the
lovely
valleys
of
his
kingdom
to
bloom
like
gardens
he
fostered
also
the
growth
and
fabrication
of
silk
until
the
looms
of
granada
surpassed
even
those
of
syria
in
the
fineness
and
beauty
of
their
productions
he
moreover
caused
the
mines
of
gold
and
silver
and
other
metals
found
in
the
mountainous
regions
of
his
dominions
to
be
diligently
worked
and
was
the
first
king
of
granada
who
struck
money
of
gold
and
silver
with
his
name
taking
great
care
that
the
coins
should
be
skilfully
executed
it
was
towards
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
just
after
his
return
from
the
siege
of
seville
that
he
commenced
the
splendid
palace
of
the
alhambra
superintending
the
building
of
it
in
person
mingling
frequently
among
the
artists
and
workmen
and
directing
their
labors
though
thus
magnificent
in
his
works
and
great
in
his
enterprises
he
was
simple
in
his
person
and
moderate
in
his
enjoyments
his
dress
was
not
merely
void
of
splendor
but
so
plain
as
not
to
distinguish
him
from
his
subjects
his
harem
boasted
but
few
beauties
and
these
he
visited
but
seldom
though
they
were
entertained
with
great
magnificence
his
wives
were
daughters
of
the
principal
nobles
and
were
treated
by
him
as
friends
and
rational
companions
what
is
more
he
managed
to
make
them
live
in
friendship
with
one
another
he
passed
much
of
his
time
in
his
gardens
especially
in
those
of
the
alhambra
which
he
had
stored
with
the
rarest
plants
and
the
most
beautiful
and
aromatic
flowers
here
he
delighted
himself
in
reading
histories
or
in
causing
them
to
be
read
and
related
to
him
and
sometimes
in
intervals
of
leisure
employed
himself
in
the
instruction
of
his
three
sons
for
whom
he
had
provided
the
most
learned
and
virtuous
masters
as
he
had
frankly
and
voluntarily
offered
himself
a
tributary
vassal
to
ferdinand
so
he
always
remained
loyal
to
his
word
giving
him
repeated
proofs
of
fidelity
and
attachment
when
that
renowned
monarch
died
in
seville
in
alhamar
sent
ambassadors
to
condole
with
his
successor
alonzo
and
with
them
a
gallant
train
of
a
hundred
moorish
cavaliers
of
distinguished
rank
who
were
to
attend
round
the
royal
bier
during
the
funeral
ceremonies
each
bearing
a
lighted
taper
this
grand
testimonial
of
respect
was
repeated
by
the
moslem
monarch
during
the
remainder
of
his
life
on
each
anniversary
of
the
death
of
king
ferdinand
el
santo
when
the
hundred
moorish
knights
repaired
from
granada
to
seville
and
took
their
stations
with
lighted
tapers
in
the
centre
of
the
sumptuous
cathedral
round
the
cenotaph
of
the
illustrious
deceased
alhamar
retained
his
faculties
and
vigor
to
an
advanced
age
in
his
year
he
took
the
field
on
horseback
accompanied
by
the
flower
of
his
chivalry
to
resist
an
invasion
of
his
territories
as
the
army
sallied
forth
from
granada
one
of
the
principal
adalides
or
guides
who
rode
in
the
advance
accidentally
broke
his
lance
against
the
arch
of
the
gate
the
counsellors
of
the
king
alarmed
by
this
circumstance
which
was
considered
an
evil
omen
entreated
him
to
return
their
supplications
were
in
vain
the
king
persisted
and
at
noontide
the
omen
say
the
moorish
chroniclers
was
fatally
fulfilled
alhamar
was
suddenly
struck
with
illness
and
had
nearly
fallen
from
his
horse
he
was
placed
on
a
litter
and
borne
back
towards
granada
but
his
illness
increased
to
such
a
degree
that
they
were
obliged
to
pitch
his
tent
in
the
vega
his
physicians
were
filled
with
consternation
not
knowing
what
remedy
to
prescribe
in
a
few
hours
he
died
vomiting
blood
and
in
violent
convulsions
the
castilian
prince
don
philip
brother
of
alonzo
was
by
his
side
when
he
expired
his
body
was
embalmed
enclosed
in
a
silver
coffin
and
buried
in
the
alhambra
in
a
sepulchre
of
precious
marble
amidst
the
unfeigned
lamentations
of
his
subjects
who
bewailed
him
as
a
parent
i
have
said
that
he
was
the
first
of
the
illustrious
line
of
nasar
that
sat
upon
a
throne
i
may
add
that
he
was
the
founder
of
a
brilliant
kingdom
which
will
ever
be
famous
in
history
and
romance
as
the
last
of
moslem
power
and
splendor
in
the
peninsula
though
his
undertakings
were
vast
and
his
expenditures
immense
yet
his
treasury
was
always
full
and
this
seeming
contradiction
gave
rise
to
the
story
that
he
was
versed
in
magic
art
and
possessed
of
the
secret
for
transmuting
baser
metals
into
gold
those
who
have
attended
to
his
domestic
policy
as
here
set
forth
will
easily
understand
the
natural
magic
and
simple
alchemy
which
made
his
ample
treasury
to
overflow
yusef
abul
hagig
the
finisher
of
the
alhambra
to
the
foregoing
particulars
concerning
the
moslem
princes
who
once
reigned
in
these
halls
i
shall
add
a
brief
notice
of
the
monarch
who
completed
and
embellished
the
alhambra
yusef
abul
hagig
or
as
it
is
sometimes
written
haxis
was
another
prince
of
the
noble
line
of
nasar
he
ascended
the
throne
of
granada
in
the
year
of
grace
and
is
described
by
moslem
writers
as
having
a
noble
presence
great
bodily
strength
and
a
fair
complexion
and
the
majesty
of
his
countenance
increased
say
they
by
suffering
his
beard
to
grow
to
a
dignified
length
and
dyeing
it
black
his
manners
were
gentle
affable
and
urbane
he
carried
the
benignity
of
his
nature
into
warfare
prohibiting
all
wanton
cruelty
and
enjoining
mercy
and
protection
towards
women
and
children
the
aged
and
infirm
and
all
friars
and
other
persons
of
holy
and
recluse
life
but
though
he
possessed
the
courage
common
to
generous
spirits
the
bent
of
his
genius
was
more
for
peace
than
war
and
though
repeatedly
obliged
by
circumstances
to
take
up
arms
he
was
generally
unfortunate
among
other
enterprises
he
undertook
a
great
campaign
in
conjunction
with
the
king
of
morocco
against
the
kings
of
castile
and
portugal
but
was
defeated
in
the
memorable
battle
of
salado
which
had
nearly
proved
a
to
the
moslem
power
in
spain
yusef
obtained
a
long
truce
after
this
defeat
and
now
his
character
shone
forth
in
its
true
lustre
he
had
an
excellent
memory
and
had
stored
his
mind
with
science
and
erudition
his
taste
was
altogether
elegant
and
refined
and
he
was
accounted
the
best
poet
of
his
time
devoting
himself
to
the
instruction
of
his
people
and
the
improvement
of
their
morals
and
manners
he
established
schools
in
all
the
villages
with
simple
and
uniform
systems
of
education
he
obliged
every
hamlet
of
more
than
twelve
houses
to
have
a
mosque
and
purified
the
ceremonies
of
religion
and
the
festivals
and
popular
amusements
from
various
abuses
and
indecorums
which
had
crept
into
them
he
attended
vigilantly
to
the
police
of
the
city
establishing
nocturnal
guards
and
patrols
and
superintending
all
municipal
concerns
his
attention
was
also
directed
towards
finishing
the
great
architectural
works
commenced
by
his
predecessors
and
erecting
others
on
his
own
plans
the
alhambra
which
had
been
founded
by
the
good
alhamar
was
now
completed
yusef
constructed
the
beautiful
gate
of
justice
forming
the
grand
entrance
to
the
fortress
which
he
finished
in
he
likewise
adorned
many
of
the
courts
and
halls
of
the
palace
as
may
be
seen
by
the
inscriptions
on
the
walls
in
which
his
name
repeatedly
occurs
he
built
also
the
noble
alcazar
or
citadel
of
malaga
now
unfortunately
a
mere
mass
of
crumbling
ruins
but
which
most
probably
exhibited
in
its
interior
similar
elegance
and
magnificence
with
the
alhambra
the
genius
of
a
sovereign
stamps
a
character
upon
his
time
the
nobles
of
granada
imitating
the
elegant
and
graceful
taste
of
yusef
soon
filled
the
city
of
granada
with
magnificent
palaces
the
halls
of
which
were
paved
with
mosaic
the
walls
and
ceilings
wrought
in
fretwork
and
delicately
gilded
and
painted
with
azure
vermilion
and
other
brilliant
colors
or
minutely
inlaid
with
cedar
and
other
precious
woods
specimens
of
which
have
survived
in
all
their
lustre
the
lapse
of
several
centuries
many
of
the
houses
had
fountains
which
threw
up
jets
of
water
to
refresh
and
cool
the
air
they
had
lofty
towers
also
of
wood
or
stone
curiously
carved
and
ornamented
and
covered
with
plates
of
metal
that
glittered
in
the
sun
such
was
the
refined
and
delicate
taste
in
architecture
that
prevailed
among
this
elegant
people
insomuch
that
to
use
the
beautiful
simile
of
an
arabian
writer
granada
in
the
days
of
yusef
was
as
a
silver
vase
filled
with
emeralds
and
one
anecdote
will
be
sufficient
to
show
the
magnanimity
of
this
generous
prince
the
long
truce
which
had
succeeded
the
battle
of
salado
was
at
an
end
and
every
effort
of
yusef
to
renew
it
was
in
vain
his
deadly
foe
alfonso
xi
of
castile
took
the
field
with
great
force
and
laid
siege
to
gibraltar
yusef
reluctantly
took
up
arms
and
sent
troops
to
the
relief
of
the
place
in
the
midst
of
his
anxiety
he
received
tidings
that
his
dreaded
foe
had
suddenly
fallen
a
victim
to
the
plague
instead
of
manifesting
exultation
on
the
occasion
yusef
called
to
mind
the
great
qualities
of
the
deceased
and
was
touched
with
a
noble
sorrow
alas
cried
he
the
world
has
lost
one
of
its
most
excellent
princes
a
sovereign
who
knew
how
to
honor
merit
whether
in
friend
or
foe
the
spanish
chroniclers
themselves
bear
witness
to
this
magnanimity
according
to
their
accounts
the
moorish
cavaliers
partook
of
the
sentiment
of
their
king
and
put
on
mourning
for
the
death
of
alfonzo
even
those
of
gibraltar
who
had
been
so
closely
invested
when
they
knew
that
the
hostile
monarch
lay
dead
in
his
camp
determined
among
themselves
that
no
hostile
movement
should
be
made
against
the
christians
the
day
on
which
the
camp
was
broken
up
and
the
army
departed
bearing
the
corpse
of
alfonzo
the
moors
issued
in
multitudes
from
gibraltar
and
stood
mute
and
melancholy
watching
the
mournful
pageant
the
same
reverence
for
the
deceased
was
observed
by
all
the
moorish
commanders
on
the
frontiers
who
suffered
the
funeral
train
to
pass
in
safety
bearing
the
corpse
of
the
christian
sovereign
from
gibraltar
to
seville
yusef
did
not
long
survive
the
enemy
he
had
so
generously
deplored
in
the
year
as
he
was
one
day
praying
in
the
royal
mosque
of
the
alhambra
a
maniac
rushed
suddenly
from
behind
and
plunged
a
dagger
in
his
side
the
cries
of
the
king
brought
his
guards
and
courtiers
to
his
assistance
they
found
him
weltering
in
his
blood
he
made
some
signs
as
if
to
speak
but
his
words
were
unintelligible
they
bore
him
senseless
to
the
royal
apartments
where
he
expired
almost
immediately
the
murderer
was
cut
to
pieces
and
his
limbs
burnt
in
public
to
gratify
the
fury
of
the
populace
the
body
of
the
king
was
interred
in
a
superb
sepulchre
of
white
marble
a
long
epitaph
in
letters
of
gold
upon
an
azure
ground
recorded
his
virtues
here
lies
a
king
and
martyr
of
an
illustrious
line
gentle
learned
and
virtuous
renowned
for
the
graces
of
his
person
and
his
manners
whose
clemency
piety
and
benevolence
were
extolled
throughout
the
kingdom
of
granada
he
was
a
great
prince
an
illustrious
captain
a
sharp
sword
of
the
moslems
a
valiant
among
the
most
potent
monarchs
the
mosque
still
exists
which
once
resounded
with
the
dying
cries
of
yusef
but
the
monument
which
recorded
his
virtues
has
long
since
disappeared
his
name
however
remains
inscribed
among
the
delicate
and
graceful
ornaments
of
the
alhambra
and
will
be
perpetuated
in
connection
with
this
renowned
pile
which
it
was
his
pride
and
delight
to
beautify
the
mysterious
chambers
as
i
was
rambling
one
day
about
the
moorish
halls
my
attention
was
for
the
first
time
attracted
to
a
door
in
a
remote
gallery
communicating
apparently
with
some
part
of
the
alhambra
which
i
had
not
yet
explored
i
attempted
to
open
it
but
it
was
locked
i
knocked
but
no
one
answered
and
the
sound
seemed
to
reverberate
through
empty
chambers
here
then
was
a
mystery
here
was
the
haunted
wing
of
the
castle
how
was
i
to
get
at
the
dark
secrets
here
shut
up
from
the
public
eye
should
i
come
privately
at
night
with
lamp
and
sword
according
to
the
prying
custom
of
heroes
of
romance
or
should
i
endeavor
to
draw
the
secret
from
pépe
the
stuttering
gardener
or
the
ingenuous
dolores
or
the
loquacious
mateo
or
should
i
go
frankly
and
openly
to
dame
antonia
the
chatelaine
and
ask
her
all
about
it
i
chose
the
latter
course
as
being
the
simplest
though
the
least
romantic
and
found
somewhat
to
my
disappointment
that
there
was
no
mystery
in
the
case
i
was
welcome
to
explore
the
apartment
and
there
was
the
key
thus
provided
i
returned
forthwith
to
the
door
it
opened
as
i
had
surmised
to
a
range
of
vacant
chambers
but
they
were
quite
different
from
the
rest
of
the
palace
the
architecture
though
rich
and
antiquated
was
european
there
was
nothing
moorish
about
it
the
first
two
rooms
were
lofty
the
ceilings
broken
in
many
places
were
of
cedar
deeply
panelled
and
skilfully
carved
with
fruits
and
flowers
intermingled
with
grotesque
masks
or
faces
the
walls
had
evidently
in
ancient
times
been
hung
with
damask
but
now
were
naked
and
scrawled
over
by
that
class
of
aspiring
travellers
who
defile
noble
monuments
with
their
worthless
names
the
windows
dismantled
and
open
to
wind
and
weather
looked
out
into
a
charming
little
secluded
garden
where
an
alabaster
fountain
sparkled
among
roses
and
myrtles
and
was
surrounded
by
orange
and
citron
trees
some
of
which
flung
their
branches
into
the
chambers
beyond
these
rooms
were
two
saloons
longer
but
less
lofty
looking
also
into
the
garden
in
the
compartments
of
the
panelled
ceilings
were
baskets
of
fruit
and
garlands
of
flowers
painted
by
no
mean
hand
and
in
tolerable
preservation
the
walls
also
had
been
painted
in
fresco
in
the
italian
style
but
the
paintings
were
nearly
obliterated
the
windows
were
in
the
same
shattered
state
with
those
of
the
other
chambers
this
fanciful
suite
of
rooms
terminated
in
an
open
gallery
with
balustrades
running
at
right
angles
along
another
side
of
the
garden
the
whole
apartment
so
delicate
and
elegant
in
its
decorations
so
choice
and
sequestered
in
its
situation
along
this
retired
little
garden
and
so
different
in
architecture
from
the
neighboring
halls
awakened
an
interest
in
its
history
i
found
on
inquiry
that
it
was
an
apartment
fitted
up
by
italian
artists
in
the
early
part
of
the
last
century
at
the
time
when
philip
and
his
second
wife
the
beautiful
elizabetta
of
farnese
daughter
of
the
duke
of
parma
were
expected
at
the
alhambra
it
was
destined
for
the
queen
and
the
ladies
of
her
train
one
of
the
loftiest
chambers
had
been
her
a
narrow
staircase
now
walled
up
led
up
to
a
delightful
belvidere
originally
a
mirador
of
the
moorish
sultanas
communicating
with
the
harem
but
which
was
fitted
up
as
a
boudoir
for
the
fair
elizabetta
and
still
retains
the
name
of
tocador
de
la
or
the
queen
s
toilette
one
window
of
the
royal
commanded
a
prospect
of
the
generalife
and
its
embowered
terraces
another
looked
out
into
the
little
secluded
garden
i
have
mentioned
which
was
decidedly
moorish
in
its
character
and
also
had
its
history
it
was
in
fact
the
garden
of
lindaraxa
so
often
mentioned
in
descriptions
of
the
alhambra
but
who
this
lindaraxa
was
i
had
never
heard
explained
a
little
research
gave
me
the
few
particulars
known
about
her
she
was
a
moorish
beauty
who
flourished
in
the
court
of
muhamed
the
and
was
the
daughter
of
his
loyal
adherent
the
alcayde
of
malaga
who
sheltered
him
in
his
city
when
driven
from
the
throne
on
regaining
his
crown
the
alcayde
was
rewarded
for
his
fidelity
his
daughter
had
her
apartment
in
the
alhambra
and
was
given
by
the
king
in
marriage
to
nasar
a
young
cetimerien
prince
descended
from
aben
hud
the
just
their
espousals
were
doubtless
celebrated
in
the
royal
palace
and
their
honeymoon
may
have
passed
among
these
very
bowers
four
centuries
had
elapsed
since
the
fair
lindaraxa
passed
away
yet
how
much
of
the
fragile
beauty
of
the
scenes
she
inhabited
remained
the
garden
still
bloomed
in
which
she
delighted
the
fountain
still
presented
the
crystal
mirror
in
which
her
charms
may
once
have
been
reflected
the
alabaster
it
is
true
had
lost
its
whiteness
the
basin
beneath
overrun
with
weeds
had
become
the
of
the
lizard
but
there
was
something
in
the
very
decay
that
enhanced
the
interest
of
the
scene
speaking
as
it
did
of
that
mutability
the
irrevocable
lot
of
man
and
all
his
works
the
desolation
too
of
these
chambers
once
the
abode
of
the
proud
and
elegant
elizabetta
had
a
more
touching
charm
for
me
than
if
i
had
beheld
them
in
their
pristine
splendor
glittering
with
the
pageantry
of
a
court
when
i
returned
to
my
quarters
in
the
governor
s
apartment
everything
seemed
tame
and
commonplace
after
the
poetic
region
i
had
left
the
thought
suggested
itself
why
could
i
not
change
my
quarters
to
these
vacant
chambers
that
would
indeed
be
living
in
the
alhambra
surrounded
by
its
gardens
and
fountains
as
in
the
time
of
the
moorish
sovereigns
i
proposed
the
change
to
dame
antonia
and
her
family
and
it
occasioned
vast
surprise
they
could
not
conceive
any
rational
inducement
for
the
choice
of
an
apartment
so
forlorn
remote
and
solitary
dolores
exclaimed
at
its
frightful
loneliness
nothing
but
bats
and
owls
flitting
about
and
then
a
fox
and
wildcat
kept
in
the
vaults
of
the
neighboring
baths
and
roamed
about
at
night
the
good
tia
had
more
reasonable
objections
the
neighborhood
was
infested
by
vagrants
gypsies
swarmed
in
the
caverns
of
the
adjacent
hills
the
palace
was
ruinous
and
easy
to
be
entered
in
many
places
the
rumor
of
a
stranger
quartered
alone
in
one
of
the
remote
and
ruined
apartments
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
rest
of
the
inhabitants
might
tempt
unwelcome
visitors
in
the
night
especially
as
foreigners
were
always
supposed
to
be
well
stocked
with
money
i
was
not
to
be
diverted
from
my
humor
however
and
my
will
was
law
with
these
good
people
so
calling
in
the
assistance
of
a
carpenter
and
the
over
officious
mateo
ximenes
the
doors
and
windows
were
soon
placed
in
a
state
of
tolerable
security
and
the
of
the
stately
elizabetta
prepared
for
my
reception
mateo
kindly
volunteered
as
a
to
sleep
in
my
antechamber
but
i
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
put
his
valor
to
the
proof
with
all
the
hardihood
i
had
assumed
and
all
the
precautions
i
had
taken
i
must
confess
the
first
night
passed
in
these
quarters
was
inexpressibly
dreary
i
do
not
think
it
was
so
much
the
apprehension
of
dangers
from
without
that
affected
me
as
the
character
of
the
place
itself
with
all
its
strange
associations
the
deeds
of
violence
committed
there
the
tragical
ends
of
many
of
those
who
had
once
reigned
there
in
splendor
as
i
passed
beneath
the
fated
halls
of
the
tower
of
comares
on
the
way
to
my
chamber
i
called
to
mind
a
quotation
that
used
to
thrill
me
in
the
days
of
boyhood
fate
sits
on
these
dark
battlements
and
frowns
and
as
the
portal
opens
to
receive
me
a
voice
in
sullen
echoes
through
the
courts
tells
of
a
nameless
deed
the
whole
family
escorted
me
to
my
chamber
and
took
leave
of
me
as
of
one
engaged
on
a
perilous
enterprise
and
when
i
heard
their
retreating
steps
die
away
along
the
waste
antechambers
and
echoing
galleries
and
turned
the
key
of
my
door
i
was
reminded
of
those
hobgoblin
stories
where
the
hero
is
left
to
accomplish
the
adventure
of
an
enchanted
house
even
the
thoughts
of
the
fair
elizabetta
and
the
beauties
of
her
court
who
had
once
graced
these
chambers
now
by
a
perversion
of
fancy
added
to
the
gloom
here
was
the
scene
of
their
transient
gayety
and
loveliness
here
were
the
very
traces
of
their
elegance
and
enjoyment
but
what
and
where
were
they
dust
and
ashes
tenants
of
the
tomb
phantoms
of
the
memory
a
vague
and
indescribable
awe
was
creeping
over
me
i
would
fain
have
ascribed
it
to
the
thoughts
of
robbers
awakened
by
the
evening
s
conversation
but
i
felt
it
was
something
more
unreal
and
absurd
the
superstitions
of
the
nursery
were
reviving
and
asserting
their
power
over
my
imagination
everything
began
to
be
affected
by
the
working
of
my
mind
the
whispering
of
the
wind
among
the
beneath
my
window
had
something
sinister
i
cast
my
eyes
into
the
garden
of
lindaraxa
the
groves
presented
a
gulf
of
shadows
the
thickets
indistinct
and
ghastly
shapes
i
was
glad
to
close
the
window
but
my
chamber
itself
became
infected
there
was
a
slight
rustling
noise
overhead
a
bat
suddenly
emerged
from
a
broken
panel
of
the
ceiling
flitting
about
the
room
and
athwart
my
solitary
lamp
and
as
the
fateful
bird
almost
flouted
my
face
with
his
noiseless
wing
the
grotesque
faces
carved
in
high
relief
in
the
cedar
ceiling
whence
he
had
emerged
seemed
to
mope
and
mow
at
me
rousing
myself
and
half
smiling
at
this
temporary
weakness
i
resolved
to
brave
it
out
in
the
true
spirit
of
the
hero
of
the
enchanted
house
so
taking
lamp
in
hand
i
sallied
forth
to
make
a
tour
of
the
palace
notwithstanding
every
mental
exertion
the
task
was
a
severe
one
i
had
to
traverse
waste
halls
and
mysterious
galleries
where
the
rays
of
the
lamp
extended
but
a
short
distance
around
me
i
walked
as
it
were
in
a
mere
halo
of
light
walled
in
by
impenetrable
darkness
the
vaulted
corridors
were
as
caverns
the
ceilings
of
the
halls
were
lost
in
gloom
i
recalled
all
that
had
been
said
of
the
danger
from
interlopers
in
these
remote
and
ruined
apartments
might
not
some
vagrant
foe
be
lurking
before
or
behind
me
in
the
outer
darkness
my
own
shadow
cast
upon
the
wall
began
to
disturb
me
the
echoes
of
my
own
footsteps
along
the
corridors
made
me
pause
and
look
round
i
was
traversing
scenes
fraught
with
dismal
recollections
one
dark
passage
led
down
to
the
mosque
where
yusef
the
moorish
monarch
the
finisher
of
the
alhambra
had
been
basely
murdered
in
another
place
i
trod
the
gallery
where
another
monarch
had
been
struck
down
by
the
poniard
of
a
relative
whom
he
had
thwarted
in
his
love
a
low
murmuring
sound
as
of
stifled
voices
and
clanking
chains
now
reached
me
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
hall
of
the
abencerrages
i
knew
it
to
be
the
rush
of
water
through
subterranean
channels
but
it
sounded
strangely
in
the
night
and
reminded
me
of
the
dismal
stories
to
which
it
had
given
rise
soon
however
my
ear
was
assailed
by
sounds
too
fearfully
real
to
be
the
work
of
fancy
as
i
was
crossing
the
hall
of
ambassadors
low
moans
and
broken
ejaculations
rose
as
it
were
from
beneath
my
feet
i
paused
and
listened
they
then
appeared
to
be
outside
of
the
tower
then
again
within
then
broke
forth
howlings
as
of
an
animal
then
stifled
shrieks
and
inarticulate
ravings
heard
in
that
dead
hour
and
singular
place
the
effect
was
thrilling
i
had
no
desire
for
further
perambulation
but
returned
to
my
chamber
with
infinitely
more
alacrity
than
i
had
sallied
forth
and
drew
my
breath
more
freely
when
once
more
within
its
walls
and
the
door
bolted
behind
me
when
i
awoke
in
the
morning
with
the
sun
shining
in
at
my
window
and
lighting
up
every
part
of
the
building
with
his
cheerful
and
beams
i
could
scarcely
recall
the
shadows
and
fancies
conjured
up
by
the
gloom
of
the
preceding
night
or
believe
that
the
scenes
around
me
so
naked
and
apparent
could
have
been
clothed
with
such
imaginary
horrors
still
the
dismal
howlings
and
ejaculations
i
had
heard
were
not
ideal
they
were
soon
accounted
for
however
by
my
handmaid
dolores
being
the
ravings
of
a
poor
maniac
a
brother
of
her
aunt
who
was
subject
to
violent
paroxysms
during
which
he
was
confined
in
a
vaulted
room
beneath
the
hall
of
ambassadors
in
the
course
of
a
few
evenings
a
thorough
change
took
place
in
the
scene
and
its
associations
the
moon
which
when
i
took
possession
of
my
new
apartments
was
invisible
gradually
gained
each
evening
upon
the
darkness
of
the
night
and
at
length
rolled
in
full
splendor
above
the
towers
pouring
a
flood
of
tempered
light
into
every
court
and
hall
the
garden
beneath
my
window
before
wrapped
in
gloom
was
gently
lighted
up
the
were
tipped
with
silver
the
fountain
sparkled
in
the
moonbeams
and
even
the
blush
of
the
rose
was
faintly
visible
i
now
felt
the
poetic
merit
of
the
arabic
inscription
on
the
walls
how
beauteous
is
this
garden
where
the
flowers
of
the
earth
vie
with
the
stars
of
heaven
what
can
compare
with
the
vase
of
yon
alabaster
fountain
filled
with
crystal
water
nothing
but
the
moon
in
her
fulness
shining
in
the
midst
of
an
unclouded
sky
on
such
heavenly
nights
i
would
sit
for
hours
at
my
window
inhaling
the
sweetness
of
the
garden
and
musing
on
the
checkered
fortunes
of
those
whose
history
was
dimly
shadowed
out
in
the
elegant
memorials
around
sometimes
when
all
was
quiet
and
the
clock
from
the
distant
cathedral
of
granada
struck
the
midnight
hour
i
have
sallied
out
on
another
tour
and
wandered
over
the
whole
building
but
how
different
from
my
first
tour
no
longer
dark
and
mysterious
no
longer
peopled
with
shadowy
foes
no
longer
recalling
scenes
of
violence
and
murder
all
was
open
spacious
beautiful
everything
called
up
pleasing
and
romantic
fancies
lindaraxa
once
more
walked
in
her
garden
the
gay
chivalry
of
moslem
granada
once
more
glittered
about
the
court
of
lions
who
can
do
justice
to
a
moonlight
night
in
such
a
climate
and
such
a
place
the
temperature
of
a
summer
midnight
in
andalusia
is
perfectly
ethereal
we
seem
lifted
up
into
a
purer
atmosphere
we
feel
a
serenity
of
soul
a
buoyancy
of
spirits
an
elasticity
of
frame
which
render
mere
existence
happiness
but
when
moonlight
is
added
to
all
this
the
effect
is
like
enchantment
under
its
plastic
sway
the
alhambra
seems
to
regain
its
pristine
glories
every
rent
and
chasm
of
time
every
mouldering
tint
and
is
gone
the
marble
resumes
its
original
whiteness
the
long
colonnades
brighten
in
the
moonbeams
the
halls
are
illuminated
with
a
softened
radiance
we
tread
the
enchanted
palace
of
an
arabian
tale
what
a
delight
at
such
a
time
to
ascend
to
the
little
airy
pavilion
of
the
queen
s
toilette
el
tocador
de
la
reyna
which
like
a
overhangs
the
valley
of
the
darro
and
gaze
from
its
light
arcades
upon
the
moonlight
prospect
to
the
right
the
swelling
mountains
of
the
sierra
nevada
robbed
of
their
ruggedness
and
softened
into
a
fairy
land
with
their
snowy
summits
gleaming
like
silver
clouds
against
the
deep
blue
sky
and
then
to
lean
over
the
parapet
of
the
tocador
and
gaze
down
upon
granada
and
the
albaycin
spread
out
like
a
map
below
all
buried
in
deep
repose
the
white
palaces
and
convents
sleeping
in
the
moonshine
and
beyond
all
these
the
vapory
vega
fading
away
like
a
dreamland
in
the
distance
sometimes
the
faint
click
of
castanets
rise
from
the
alameda
where
some
gay
andalusians
are
dancing
away
the
summer
night
sometimes
the
dubious
tones
of
a
guitar
and
the
notes
of
an
amorous
voice
tell
perchance
the
whereabout
of
some
moonstruck
lover
serenading
his
lady
s
window
such
is
a
faint
picture
of
the
moonlight
nights
i
have
passed
loitering
about
the
courts
and
halls
and
balconies
of
this
most
suggestive
pile
feeding
my
fancy
with
sugared
suppositions
and
enjoying
that
mixture
of
reverie
and
sensation
which
steal
away
existence
in
a
southern
climate
so
that
it
has
been
almost
morning
before
i
have
retired
to
bed
and
been
lulled
to
sleep
by
the
falling
waters
of
the
fountain
of
lindaraxa
panorama
from
the
tower
of
comares
it
is
a
serene
and
beautiful
morning
the
sun
has
not
gained
sufficient
power
to
destroy
the
freshness
of
the
night
what
a
morning
to
mount
to
the
summit
of
the
tower
of
comares
and
take
a
bird
view
of
granada
and
its
environs
come
then
worthy
reader
and
comrade
follow
my
steps
into
this
vestibule
ornamented
with
rich
tracery
which
opens
into
the
hall
of
ambassadors
we
will
not
enter
the
hall
however
but
turn
to
this
small
door
opening
into
the
wall
have
a
care
here
are
steep
winding
steps
and
but
scanty
light
yet
up
this
narrow
obscure
and
spiral
staircase
the
proud
monarchs
of
granada
and
their
queens
have
often
ascended
to
the
battlements
to
watch
the
approach
of
invading
armies
or
gaze
with
anxious
hearts
on
the
battles
in
the
vega
at
length
we
have
reached
the
terraced
roof
and
may
take
breath
for
a
moment
while
we
cast
a
general
eye
over
the
splendid
panorama
of
city
and
country
of
rocky
mountain
verdant
valley
and
fertile
plain
of
castle
cathedral
moorish
towers
and
gothic
domes
crumbling
ruins
and
blooming
groves
let
us
approach
the
battlements
and
cast
our
eyes
immediately
below
see
on
this
side
we
have
the
whole
plain
of
the
alhambra
laid
open
to
us
and
can
look
down
into
its
courts
and
gardens
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
is
the
court
of
the
alberca
with
its
great
tank
or
fishpool
bordered
with
flowers
and
yonder
is
the
court
of
lions
with
its
famous
fountain
and
its
light
moorish
arcades
and
in
the
centre
of
the
pile
is
the
little
garden
of
lindaraxa
buried
in
the
heart
of
the
building
with
its
roses
and
citrons
and
shrubbery
of
emerald
green
that
belt
of
battlements
studded
with
square
towers
straggling
round
the
whole
brow
of
the
hill
is
the
outer
boundary
of
the
fortress
some
of
the
towers
you
may
perceive
are
in
ruins
and
their
massive
fragments
buried
among
vines
and
aloes
let
us
look
on
this
northern
side
of
the
tower
it
is
a
giddy
height
the
very
foundations
of
the
tower
rise
above
the
groves
of
the
steep
and
see
a
long
fissure
in
the
massive
walls
shows
that
the
tower
has
been
rent
by
some
of
the
earthquakes
which
from
time
to
time
have
thrown
granada
into
consternation
and
which
sooner
or
later
must
reduce
this
crumbling
pile
to
a
mere
mass
of
ruin
the
deep
narrow
glen
below
us
which
gradually
widens
as
it
opens
from
the
mountains
is
the
valley
of
the
darro
you
see
the
little
river
winding
its
way
under
embowered
terraces
and
among
orchards
and
it
is
a
stream
famous
in
old
times
for
yielding
gold
and
its
sands
are
still
sifted
occasionally
in
search
of
the
precious
ore
some
of
those
white
pavilions
which
here
and
there
gleam
from
among
groves
and
vineyards
were
rustic
retreats
of
the
moors
to
enjoy
the
refreshment
of
their
gardens
well
have
they
been
compared
by
one
of
their
poets
to
so
many
pearls
set
in
a
bed
of
emeralds
the
airy
palace
with
its
tall
white
towers
and
long
arcades
which
breasts
yon
mountain
among
pompous
groves
and
hanging
gardens
is
the
generalife
a
summer
palace
of
the
moorish
kings
to
which
they
resorted
during
the
sultry
months
to
enjoy
a
still
more
breezy
region
than
that
of
the
alhambra
the
naked
summit
of
the
height
above
it
where
you
behold
some
shapeless
ruins
is
the
silla
del
moro
or
seat
of
the
moor
so
called
from
having
been
a
retreat
of
the
unfortunate
boabdil
during
the
time
of
an
insurrection
where
he
seated
himself
and
looked
down
mournfully
upon
his
rebellious
city
a
murmuring
sound
of
water
now
and
then
rises
from
the
valley
it
is
from
the
aqueduct
of
yon
moorish
mill
nearly
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
the
avenue
of
trees
beyond
is
the
alameda
along
the
bank
of
the
darro
a
favorite
resort
in
evenings
and
a
rendezvous
of
lovers
in
the
summer
nights
when
the
guitar
may
be
heard
at
a
late
hour
from
the
benches
along
its
walls
at
present
you
see
none
but
a
few
loitering
monks
there
and
a
group
of
the
latter
are
burdened
with
of
ancient
oriental
construction
such
as
were
used
by
the
moors
they
have
been
filled
at
the
cold
and
limpid
spring
called
the
fountain
of
avellanos
yon
mountain
path
leads
to
the
fountain
a
favorite
resort
of
moslems
as
well
as
christians
for
this
is
said
to
be
the
adinamar
the
fountain
of
tears
mentioned
by
ibn
batuta
the
traveller
and
celebrated
in
the
histories
and
romances
of
the
moors
you
start
tis
nothing
but
a
hawk
that
we
have
frightened
from
his
nest
this
old
tower
is
a
complete
for
vagrant
birds
the
swallow
and
martlet
abound
in
every
chink
and
cranny
and
circle
about
it
the
whole
day
long
while
at
night
when
all
other
birds
have
gone
to
rest
the
moping
owl
comes
out
of
its
and
utters
its
boding
cry
from
the
battlements
see
how
the
hawk
we
have
dislodged
sweeps
away
below
us
skimming
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
and
sailing
up
to
the
ruins
above
the
generalife
i
see
you
raise
your
eyes
to
the
snowy
summit
of
yon
pile
of
mountains
shining
like
a
white
summer
cloud
in
the
blue
sky
it
is
the
sierra
nevada
the
pride
and
delight
of
granada
the
source
of
her
cooling
breezes
and
perpetual
verdure
of
her
gushing
fountains
and
perennial
streams
it
is
this
glorious
pile
of
mountains
which
gives
to
granada
that
combination
of
delights
so
rare
in
a
southern
city
the
fresh
vegetation
and
temperate
airs
of
a
northern
climate
with
the
vivifying
ardor
of
a
tropical
sun
and
the
cloudless
azure
of
a
southern
sky
it
is
this
aërial
treasury
of
snow
which
melting
in
proportion
to
the
increase
of
the
summer
heat
sends
down
rivulets
and
streams
through
every
glen
and
gorge
of
the
alpuxarras
diffusing
emerald
verdure
and
fertility
throughout
a
chain
of
happy
and
sequestered
valleys
those
mountains
may
be
well
called
the
glory
of
granada
they
dominate
the
whole
extent
of
andalusia
and
may
be
seen
from
its
most
distant
parts
the
muleteer
hails
them
as
he
views
their
frosty
peaks
from
the
sultry
level
of
the
plain
and
the
spanish
mariner
on
the
deck
of
his
bark
far
far
off
on
the
bosom
of
the
blue
mediterranean
watches
them
with
a
pensive
eye
thinks
of
delightful
granada
and
chants
in
low
voice
some
old
romance
about
the
moors
see
to
the
south
at
the
foot
of
those
mountains
a
line
of
arid
hills
down
which
a
long
train
of
mules
is
slowly
moving
here
was
the
closing
scene
of
moslem
domination
from
the
summit
of
one
of
those
hills
the
unfortunate
boabdil
cast
back
his
last
look
upon
granada
and
gave
vent
to
the
agony
of
his
soul
it
is
the
spot
famous
in
song
and
story
the
last
sigh
of
the
further
this
way
these
arid
hills
slope
down
into
the
luxurious
vega
from
which
he
had
just
emerged
a
blooming
wilderness
of
grove
and
garden
and
teeming
orchard
with
the
xenil
winding
through
it
in
silver
links
and
feeding
innumerable
rills
which
conducted
through
ancient
moorish
channels
maintain
the
landscape
in
perpetual
verdure
here
were
the
beloved
bowers
and
gardens
and
rural
pavilions
for
which
the
unfortunate
moors
fought
with
such
desperate
valor
the
very
hovels
and
rude
granges
now
inhabited
by
boors
show
by
the
remains
of
arabesques
and
other
tasteful
decoration
that
they
were
elegant
residences
in
the
days
of
the
moslems
behold
in
the
very
centre
of
this
eventful
plain
a
place
which
in
a
manner
links
the
history
of
the
old
world
with
that
of
the
new
yon
line
of
walls
and
towers
gleaming
in
the
morning
sun
is
the
city
of
santa
fe
built
by
the
catholic
sovereigns
during
the
siege
of
granada
after
a
conflagration
had
destroyed
their
camp
it
was
to
these
walls
columbus
was
called
back
by
the
heroic
queen
and
within
them
the
treaty
was
concluded
which
led
to
the
discovery
of
the
western
world
behind
yon
promontory
to

west
is
the
bridge
of
pinos
renowned
for
many
a
bloody
fight
between

and
christians
at
this
bridge
the
messenger
overtook

when
despairing
of
success
with
the
spanish
sovereigns
he
was
departing
to
carry
his
project
of
discovery
to
the
court
of

a
range
of
mountains
bounds
the
vega
to
the
west
the
ancient
barrier
between
granada
and
the
christian
territories
among
their
heights
you
may
still
discern
warrior
towns
their
gray
walls
and
battlements
seeming
of
a
piece
with
the
rocks
on
which
they
are
built
here
and
there
a
solitary
atalaya
or
watchtower
perched
on
a
mountain
peak
looks
down
as
it
were
from
the
sky
into
the
valley
on
either
side
how
often
have
these
atalayas
given
notice
by
fire
at
night
or
smoke
by
day
of
an
approaching
foe
it
was
down
a
cragged
defile
of
these
mountains
called
the
pass
of
lope
that
the
christian
armies
descended
into
the
vega
round
the
base
of
yon
gray
and
naked
mountain
the
mountain
of
elvira
stretching
its
bold
rocky
promontory
into
the
bosom
of
the
plain
the
invading
squadrons
would
come
bursting
into
view
with
flaunting
banners
and
clangor
of
drum
and
trumpet
five
hundred
years
have
elapsed
since
ismael
ben
ferrag
a
moorish
king
of
granada
beheld
from
this
very
tower
an
invasion
of
the
kind
and
an
insulting
ravage
of
the
vega
on
which
occasion
he
displayed
an
instance
of
chivalrous
magnanimity
often
witnessed
in
the
moslem
princes
whose
history
says
an
arabian
writer
abounds
in
generous
actions
and
noble
deeds
that
will
last
through
all
succeeding
ages
and
live
forever
in
the
memory
of
but
let
us
sit
down
on
this
parapet
and
i
will
relate
the
anecdote
it
was
in
the
year
of
grace
that
ismael
ben
ferrag
beheld
from
this
tower
a
christian
camp
whitening
the
skirts
of
yon
mountain
of
elvira
the
royal
princes
don
juan
and
don
pedro
regents
of
castile
during
the
minority
of
alfonso
had
already
laid
waste
the
country
from
alcaudete
to
alcalá
la
real
capturing
the
castle
of
illora
and
setting
fire
to
its
suburbs
and
they
now
carried
their
insulting
ravages
to
the
very
gates
of
granada
defying
the
king
to
sally
forth
and
give
them
battle
ismael
though
a
young
and
intrepid
prince
hesitated
to
accept
the
challenge
he
had
not
sufficient
force
at
hand
and
awaited
the
arrival
of
troops
summoned
from
the
neighboring
towns
the
christian
princes
mistaking
his
motives
gave
up
all
hope
of
drawing
him
forth
and
having
glutted
themselves
with
ravage
struck
their
tents
and
began
their
homeward
march
don
pedro
led
the
van
and
don
juan
brought
up
the
rear
but
their
march
was
confused
and
irregular
the
army
being
greatly
encumbered
by
the
spoils
and
captives
they
had
taken
by
this
time
king
ismael
had
received
his
expected
resources
and
putting
them
under
the
command
of
osmyn
one
of
the
bravest
of
his
generals
sent
them
forth
in
hot
pursuit
of
the
enemy
the
christians
were
overtaken
in
the
defiles
of
the
mountains
a
panic
seized
them
they
were
completely
routed
and
driven
with
great
slaughter
across
the
borders
both
of
the
princes
lost
their
lives
the
body
of
don
pedro
was
carried
off
by
his
soldiers
but
that
of
don
juan
was
lost
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
his
son
wrote
to
the
moorish
king
entreating
that
the
body
of
his
father
might
be
sought
and
honorably
treated
ismael
forgot
in
a
moment
that
don
juan
was
an
enemy
who
had
carried
ravage
and
insult
to
the
very
gate
of
his
capital
he
only
thought
of
him
as
a
gallant
cavalier
and
a
royal
prince
by
his
command
diligent
search
was
made
for
the
body
it
was
found
in
a
barranco
and
brought
to
granada
there
ismael
caused
it
to
be
laid
out
in
state
on
a
lofty
bier
surrounded
by
torches
and
tapers
in
one
of
these
halls
of
the
alhambra
osmyn
and
other
of
the
noblest
cavaliers
were
appointed
as
a
guard
of
honor
and
the
christian
captives
were
assembled
to
pray
around
it
in
the
mean
time
ismael
wrote
to
the
son
of
prince
juan
to
send
a
convoy
for
the
body
assuring
him
it
should
be
faithfully
delivered
up
in
due
time
a
band
of
christian
cavaliers
arrived
for
the
purpose
they
were
honorably
received
and
entertained
by
ismael
and
on
their
departure
with
the
body
the
guard
of
honor
of
moslem
cavaliers
escorted
the
funeral
train
to
the
frontier
but
enough
the
sun
is
high
above
the
mountains
and
pours
his
full
fervor
on
our
heads
already
the
terraced
roof
is
hot
beneath
our
feet
let
us
abandon
it
and
refresh
ourselves
under
the
arcades
by
the
fountain
of
the
lions
the
truant
we
have
had
a
scene
of
a
petty
tribulation
in
the
alhambra
which
has
thrown
a
cloud
over
the
sunny
countenance
of
dolores
this
little
damsel
has
a
female
passion
for
pets
of
all
kinds
and
from
the
superabundant
kindness
of
her
disposition
one
of
the
ruined
courts
of
the
alhambra
is
thronged
with
her
favorites
a
stately
peacock
and
his
hen
seem
to
hold
regal
sway
here
over
pompous
turkeys
querulous
and
a
rabble
rout
of
common
cocks
and
hens
the
great
delight
of
dolores
however
has
for
some
time
past
been
centred
in
a
youthful
pair
of
pigeons
who
have
lately
entered
into
the
holy
state
of
wedlock
and
even
supplanted
a
cat
and
kittens
in
her
affections
as
a
tenement
for
them
wherein
to
commence
she
had
fitted
up
a
small
chamber
adjacent
to
the
kitchen
the
window
of
which
looked
into
one
of
the
quiet
moorish
courts
here
they
lived
in
happy
ignorance
of
any
world
beyond
the
court
and
its
sunny
roofs
never
had
they
aspired
to
soar
above
the
battlements
or
to
mount
to
the
summit
of
the
towers
their
virtuous
union
was
at
length
crowned
by
two
spotless
and
eggs
to
the
great
joy
of
their
cherishing
little
mistress
nothing
could
be
more
praiseworthy
than
the
conduct
of
the
young
married
folks
on
this
interesting
occasion
they
took
turns
to
sit
upon
the
nest
until
the
eggs
were
hatched
and
while
their
callow
progeny
required
warmth
and
shelter
while
one
thus
stayed
at
home
the
other
foraged
abroad
for
food
and
brought
home
abundant
supplies
this
scene
of
conjugal
felicity
has
suddenly
met
with
a
reverse
early
this
morning
as
dolores
was
feeding
the
male
pigeon
she
took
a
fancy
to
give
him
a
peep
at
the
great
world
opening
a
window
therefore
which
looks
down
upon
the
valley
of
the
darro
she
launched
him
at
once
beyond
the
walls
of
the
alhambra
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
astonished
bird
had
to
try
the
full
vigor
of
his
wings
he
swept
down
into
the
valley
and
then
rising
upwards
with
a
surge
soared
almost
to
the
clouds
never
before
had
he
risen
to
such
a
height
or
experienced
such
delight
in
flying
and
like
a
young
spendthrift
just
come
to
his
estate
he
seemed
giddy
with
excess
of
liberty
and
with
the
boundless
field
of
action
suddenly
opened
to
him
for
the
whole
day
he
has
been
circling
about
in
capricious
flights
from
tower
to
tower
and
tree
to
tree
every
attempt
has
been
vain
to
lure
him
back
by
scattering
grain
upon
the
roofs
he
seems
to
have
lost
all
thought
of
home
of
his
tender
helpmate
and
his
callow
young
to
add
to
the
anxiety
of
dolores
he
has
been
joined
by
two
or
robber
pigeons
whose
instinct
it
is
to
entice
wandering
pigeons
to
their
own
the
fugitive
like
many
other
thoughtless
youths
on
their
first
launching
upon
the
world
seems
quite
fascinated
with
these
knowing
but
graceless
companions
who
have
undertaken
to
show
him
life
and
introduce
him
to
society
he
has
been
soaring
with
them
over
all
the
roofs
and
steeples
of
granada
a
has
passed
over
the
city
but
he
has
not
sought
his
home
night
has
closed
in
and
still
he
comes
not
to
deepen
the
pathos
of
the
affair
the
female
pigeon
after
remaining
several
hours
on
the
nest
without
being
relieved
at
length
went
forth
to
seek
her
recreant
mate
but
stayed
away
so
long
that
the
young
ones
perished
for
want
of
the
warmth
and
shelter
of
the
parent
bosom
at
a
late
hour
in
the
evening
word
was
brought
to
dolores
that
the
truant
bird
had
been
seen
upon
the
towers
of
the
generalife
now
it
happens
that
the
of
that
ancient
palace
has
likewise
a
among
the
inmates
of
which
are
said
to
be
two
or
three
of
these
inveigling
birds
the
terror
of
all
neighboring
dolores
immediately
concluded
that
the
two
feathered
sharpers
who
had
been
seen
with
her
fugitive
were
these
bloods
of
the
generalife
a
council
of
war
was
forthwith
held
in
the
chamber
of
tia
antonia
the
generalife
is
a
distinct
jurisdiction
from
the
alhambra
and
of
course
some
punctilio
if
not
jealousy
exists
between
their
custodians
it
was
determined
therefore
to
send
pèpe
the
stuttering
lad
of
the
gardens
as
ambassador
to
the
administrador
requesting
that
if
such
fugitive
should
be
found
in
his
dominions
he
might
be
given
up
as
a
subject
of
the
alhambra
pèpe
departed
accordingly
on
his
diplomatic
expedition
through
the
moonlit
groves
and
avenues
but
returned
in
an
hour
with
the
afflicting
intelligence
that
no
such
bird
was
to
be
found
in
the
of
the
generalife
the
administrador
however
pledged
his
sovereign
word
that
if
such
vagrant
should
appear
there
even
at
midnight
he
should
instantly
be
arrested
and
sent
back
prisoner
to
his
little
mistress
thus
stands
the
melancholy
affair
which
has
occasioned
much
distress
throughout
the
palace
and
has
sent
the
inconsolable
dolores
to
a
sleepless
pillow
sorrow
endureth
for
a
night
says
the
proverb
but
joy
cometh
in
the
the
first
object
that
met
my
eyes
on
leaving
my
room
this
morning
was
dolores
with
the
truant
pigeon
in
her
hands
and
her
eyes
sparkling
with
joy
he
had
appeared
at
an
early
hour
on
the
battlements
hovering
shyly
about
from
roof
to
roof
but
at
length
entered
the
window
and
surrendered
himself
prisoner
he
gained
but
little
credit
however
by
his
return
for
the
ravenous
manner
in
which
he
devoured
the
food
set
before
him
showed
that
like
the
prodigal
son
he
had
been
driven
home
by
sheer
famine
dolores
upbraided
him
for
his
faithless
conduct
calling
him
all
manners
of
vagrant
names
though
womanlike
she
fondled
him
at
the
same
time
to
her
bosom
and
covered
him
with
kisses
i
observed
however
that
she
had
taken
care
to
clip
his
wings
to
prevent
all
future
soarings
a
precaution
which
i
mention
for
the
benefit
of
all
those
who
have
truant
lovers
or
wandering
husbands
more
than
one
valuable
moral
might
be
drawn
from
the
story
of
dolores
and
her
pigeon
the
balcony
i
have
spoken
of
a
balcony
of
the
central
window
of
the
hall
of
ambassadors
it
served
as
a
kind
of
observatory
where
i
used
often
to
take
my
seat
and
consider
not
merely
the
heaven
above
but
the
earth
beneath
besides
the
magnificent
prospect
which
it
commanded
of
mountain
valley
and
vega
there
was
a
little
busy
scene
of
human
life
laid
open
to
inspection
immediately
below
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
was
an
alameda
or
public
walk
which
though
not
so
fashionable
as
the
more
modern
and
splendid
paseo
of
the
xenil
still
boasted
a
varied
and
picturesque
concourse
hither
resorted
the
small
gentry
of
the
suburbs
together
with
priests
and
friars
who
walked
for
appetite
and
digestion
majos
and
majas
the
beaux
and
belles
of
the
lower
classes
in
their
andalusian
dresses
swaggering
contrabandistas
and
sometimes
and
mysterious
loungers
of
the
higher
ranks
on
some
secret
assignation
it
was
a
moving
picture
of
spanish
life
and
character
which
i
delighted
to
study
and
as
the
astronomer
has
his
grand
telescope
with
which
to
sweep
the
skies
and
as
it
were
bring
the
stars
nearer
for
his
inspection
so
i
had
a
smaller
one
of
pocket
size
for
the
use
of
my
observatory
with
which
i
could
sweep
the
regions
below
and
bring
the
countenances
of
the
motley
groups
so
close
as
almost
at
times
to
make
me
think
i
could
divine
their
conversation
by
the
play
and
expression
of
their
features
i
was
thus
in
a
manner
an
invisible
observer
and
without
quitting
my
solitude
could
throw
myself
in
an
instant
into
the
midst
of
society
a
rare
advantage
to
one
of
somewhat
shy
and
quiet
habits
and
fond
like
myself
of
observing
the
drama
of
life
without
becoming
an
actor
in
the
scene
there
was
a
considerable
suburb
lying
below
the
alhambra
filling
the
narrow
gorge
of
the
valley
and
extending
up
the
opposite
hill
of
the
albaycin
many
of
the
houses
were
built
in
the
moorish
style
round
patios
or
courts
cooled
by
fountains
and
open
to
the
sky
and
as
the
inhabitants
passed
much
of
their
time
in
these
courts
and
on
the
terraced
roofs
during
the
summer
season
it
follows
that
many
a
glance
at
their
domestic
life
might
be
obtained
by
an
aërial
spectator
like
myself
who
could
look
down
on
them
from
the
clouds
i
enjoyed
in
some
degree
the
advantages
of
the
student
in
the
famous
old
spanish
story
who
beheld
all
madrid
unroofed
for
his
inspection
and
my
gossiping
squire
mateo
ximenes
officiated
occasionally
as
my
asmodeus
to
give
me
anecdotes
of
the
different
mansions
and
their
inhabitants
i
preferred
however
to
form
conjectural
histories
for
myself
and
thus
would
sit
for
hours
weaving
from
casual
incidents
and
indications
passing
under
my
eye
a
whole
tissue
of
schemes
intrigues
and
occupations
of
the
busy
mortals
below
there
was
scarce
a
pretty
face
or
a
striking
figure
that
i
daily
saw
about
which
i
had
not
thus
gradually
framed
a
dramatic
story
though
some
of
my
characters
would
occasionally
act
in
direct
opposition
to
the
part
assigned
them
and
disconcert
the
whole
drama
reconnoitring
one
day
with
my
glass
the
streets
of
the
albaycin
i
beheld
the
procession
of
a
novice
about
to
take
the
veil
and
remarked
several
circumstances
which
excited
the
strongest
sympathy
in
the
fate
of
the
youthful
being
thus
about
to
be
consigned
to
a
living
tomb
i
ascertained
to
my
satisfaction
that
she
was
beautiful
and
from
the
paleness
of
her
cheek
that
she
was
a
victim
rather
than
a
votary
she
was
arrayed
in
bridal
garments
and
decked
with
a
chaplet
of
white
flowers
but
her
heart
evidently
revolted
at
this
mockery
of
a
spiritual
union
and
yearned
after
its
earthly
loves
a
tall
man
walked
near
her
in
the
procession
it
was
of
course
the
tyrannical
father
who
from
some
bigoted
or
sordid
motive
had
compelled
this
sacrifice
amid
the
crowd
was
a
dark
handsome
youth
in
andalusian
garb
who
seemed
to
fix
on
her
an
eye
of
agony
it
was
doubtless
the
secret
lover
from
whom
she
was
forever
to
be
separated
my
indignation
rose
as
i
noted
the
malignant
expression
painted
on
the
countenances
of
the
attendant
monks
and
friars
the
procession
arrived
at
the
chapel
of
the
convent
the
sun
gleamed
for
the
last
time
upon
the
chaplet
of
the
poor
novice
as
she
crossed
the
fatal
threshold
and
disappeared
within
the
building
the
throng
poured
in
with
cowl
and
cross
and
minstrelsy
the
lover
paused
for
a
moment
at
the
door
i
could
divine
the
tumult
of
his
feelings
but
he
mastered
them
and
entered
there
was
a
long
interval
i
pictured
to
myself
the
scene
passing
within
the
poor
novice
despoiled
of
her
transient
finery
and
clothed
in
the
conventual
garb
the
bridal
chaplet
taken
from
her
brow
and
her
beautiful
head
shorn
of
its
long
silken
tresses
i
heard
her
murmur
the
irrevocable
vow
i
saw
her
extended
on
a
bier
the
spread
over
her
the
funeral
service
performed
that
proclaimed
her
dead
to
the
world
her
sighs
were
drowned
in
the
deep
tones
of
the
organ
and
the
plaintive
requiem
of
the
nuns
the
father
looked
on
unmoved
without
a
tear
the
lover
no
my
imagination
refused
to
portray
the
anguish
of
the
lover
there
the
picture
remained
a
blank
after
a
time
the
throng
again
poured
forth
and
dispersed
various
ways
to
enjoy
the
light
of
the
sun
and
mingle
with
the
stirring
scenes
of
life
but
the
victim
with
her
bridal
chaplet
was
no
longer
there
the
door
of
the
convent
closed
that
severed
her
from
the
world
forever
i
saw
the
father
and
the
lover
issue
forth
they
were
in
earnest
conversation
the
latter
was
vehement
in
his
gesticulations
i
expected
some
violent
termination
to
my
drama
but
an
angle
of
a
building
interfered
and
closed
the
scene
my
eye
afterwards
was
frequently
turned
to
that
convent
with
painful
interest
i
remarked
late
at
night
a
solitary
light
twinkling
from
a
remote
lattice
of
one
of
its
towers
there
said
i
the
unhappy
nun
sits
weeping
in
her
cell
while
perhaps
her
lover
paces
the
street
below
in
unavailing
the
officious
mateo
interrupted
my
meditations
and
destroyed
in
an
instant
the
cobweb
tissue
of
my
fancy
with
his
usual
zeal
he
had
gathered
facts
concerning
the
scene
which
put
my
fictions
all
to
flight
the
heroine
of
my
romance
was
neither
young
nor
handsome
she
had
no
lover
she
had
entered
the
convent
of
her
own
free
will
as
a
respectable
asylum
and
was
one
of
the
most
cheerful
residents
within
its
walls
it
was
some
little
while
before
i
could
forgive
the
wrong
done
me
by
the
nun
in
being
thus
happy
in
her
cell
in
contradiction
to
all
the
rules
of
romance
i
diverted
my
spleen
however
by
watching
for
a
day
or
two
the
pretty
coquetries
of
a
brunette
who
from
the
covert
of
a
balcony
shrouded
with
flowering
shrubs
and
a
silken
awning
was
carrying
on
a
mysterious
correspondence
with
a
handsome
dark
cavalier
who
lurked
frequently
in
the
street
beneath
her
window
sometimes
i
saw
him
at
an
early
hour
stealing
forth
wrapped
to
the
eyes
in
a
mantle
sometimes
he
loitered
at
a
corner
in
various
disguises
apparently
waiting
for
a
private
signal
to
slip
into
the
house
then
there
was
the
tinkling
of
a
guitar
at
night
and
a
lantern
shifted
from
place
to
place
in
the
balcony
i
imagined
another
intrigue
like
that
of
almaviva
but
was
again
disconcerted
in
all
my
suppositions
the
supposed
lover
turned
out
to
be
the
husband
of
the
lady
and
a
noted
contrabandista
and
all
his
mysterious
signs
and
movements
had
doubtless
some
smuggling
scheme
in
view
i
occasionally
amused
myself
with
noting
from
this
balcony
the
gradual
changes
of
the
scenes
below
according
to
the
different
stages
of
the
day
scarce
has
the
gray
dawn
streaked
the
sky
and
the
earliest
cock
crowed
from
the
cottages
of
the
when
the
suburbs
give
sign
of
reviving
animation
for
the
fresh
hours
of
dawning
are
precious
in
the
summer
season
in
a
sultry
climate
all
are
anxious
to
get
the
start
of
the
sun
in
the
business
of
the
day
the
muleteer
drives
forth
his
loaded
train
for
the
journey
the
traveller
slings
his
carbine
behind
his
saddle
and
mounts
his
steed
at
the
gate
of
the
hostel
the
brown
peasant
from
the
country
urges
forward
his
loitering
beasts
laden
with
panniers
of
sunny
fruit
and
fresh
dewy
vegetables
for
already
the
thrifty
housewives
are
hastening
to
the
market
the
sun
is
up
and
sparkles
along
the
valley
tipping
the
transparent
foliage
of
the
groves
the
matin
bells
resound
melodiously
through
the
pure
bright
air
announcing
the
hour
of
devotion
the
muleteer
halts
his
burdened
animals
before
the
chapel
thrusts
his
staff
through
his
belt
behind
and
enters
with
hat
in
hand
smoothing
his
hair
to
hear
a
mass
and
to
put
up
a
prayer
for
a
prosperous
wayfaring
across
the
sierra
and
now
steals
forth
on
fairy
foot
the
gentle
señora
in
trim
basquiña
with
restless
fan
in
hand
and
dark
eye
flashing
from
beneath
the
gracefully
folded
mantilla
she
seeks
some
church
to
offer
up
her
morning
orisons
but
the
nicely
adjusted
dress
the
dainty
shoe
and
cobweb
stocking
the
raven
tresses
exquisitely
braided
the
rose
gleaming
among
them
like
a
gem
show
that
earth
divides
with
heaven
the
empire
of
her
thoughts
keep
an
eye
upon
her
careful
mother
or
virgin
aunt
or
vigilant
duenna
whichever
you
may
be
that
walk
behind
as
the
morning
advances
the
din
of
labor
augments
on
every
side
the
streets
are
thronged
with
man
and
steed
and
beast
of
burden
and
there
is
a
hum
and
murmur
like
the
surges
of
the
ocean
as
the
sun
ascends
to
his
meridian
the
hum
and
bustle
gradually
decline
at
the
height
of
noon
there
is
a
pause
the
panting
city
sinks
into
lassitude
and
for
several
hours
there
is
a
general
repose
the
windows
are
closed
the
curtains
drawn
the
inhabitants
retired
into
the
coolest
recesses
of
their
mansions
the
monk
snores
in
his
dormitory
the
brawny
porter
lies
stretched
on
the
pavement
beside
his
burden
the
peasant
and
the
laborer
sleep
beneath
the
trees
of
the
alameda
lulled
by
the
sultry
chirping
of
the
locust
the
streets
are
deserted
except
by
the
who
refreshes
the
ear
by
proclaiming
the
merits
of
his
sparkling
beverage
colder
than
the
mountain
snow
friaque
la
as
the
sun
declines
there
is
again
a
gradual
reviving
and
when
the
vesper
bell
rings
out
his
sinking
knell
all
nature
seems
to
rejoice
that
the
tyrant
of
the
day
has
fallen
now
begins
the
bustle
of
enjoyment
when
the
citizens
pour
forth
to
breathe
the
evening
air
and
revel
away
the
brief
twilight
in
the
walks
and
gardens
of
the
darro
and
xenil
as
night
closes
the
capricious
scene
assumes
new
features
light
after
light
gradually
twinkles
forth
here
a
taper
from
a
balconied
window
there
a
votive
lamp
before
the
image
of
a
saint
thus
by
degrees
the
city
emerges
from
the
pervading
gloom
and
sparkles
with
scattered
lights
like
the
starry
firmament
now
break
forth
from
court
and
garden
and
street
and
lane
the
tinkling
of
innumerable
guitars
and
the
clicking
of
castanets
blending
at
this
lofty
height
in
a
faint
but
general
concert
enjoy
the
moment
is
the
creed
of
the
gay
and
amorous
andalusian
and
at
no
time
does
he
practise
it
more
zealously
than
on
the
balmy
nights
of
summer
wooing
his
mistress
with
the
dance
the
and
the
passionate
serenade
i
was
one
evening
seated
in
the
balcony
enjoying
the
light
breeze
that
came
rustling
along
the
side
of
the
hill
among
the
when
my
humble
historiographer
mateo
who
was
at
my
elbow
pointed
out
a
spacious
house
in
an
obscure
street
of
the
albaycin
about
which
he
related
as
nearly
as
i
can
recollect
the
following
anecdote
the
adventure
of
the
mason
there
was
once
upon
a
time
a
poor
mason
or
bricklayer
in
granada
who
kept
all
the
saints
days
and
holidays
and
saint
monday
into
the
bargain
and
yet
with
all
his
devotion
he
grew
poorer
and
poorer
and
could
scarcely
earn
bread
for
his
numerous
family
one
night
he
was
roused
from
his
first
sleep
by
a
knocking
at
his
door
he
opened
it
and
beheld
before
him
a
tall
meagre
priest
hark
ye
honest
friend
said
the
stranger
i
have
observed
that
you
are
a
good
christian
and
one
to
be
trusted
will
you
undertake
a
job
this
very
night
with
all
my
heart
señor
padre
on
condition
that
i
am
paid
that
you
shall
be
but
you
must
suffer
yourself
to
be
to
this
the
mason
made
no
objection
so
being
hoodwinked
he
was
led
by
the
priest
through
various
rough
lanes
and
winding
passages
until
they
stopped
before
the
portal
of
a
house
the
priest
then
applied
a
key
turned
a
creaking
lock
and
opened
what
sounded
like
a
ponderous
door
they
entered
the
door
was
closed
and
bolted
and
the
mason
was
conducted
through
an
echoing
corridor
and
a
spacious
hall
to
an
interior
part
of
the
building
here
the
bandage
was
removed
from
his
eyes
and
he
found
himself
in
a
patio
or
court
dimly
lighted
by
a
single
lamp
in
the
centre
was
the
dry
basin
of
an
old
moorish
fountain
under
which
the
priest
requested
him
to
form
a
small
vault
bricks
and
mortar
being
at
hand
for
the
purpose
he
accordingly
worked
all
night
but
without
finishing
the
job
just
before
daybreak
the
priest
put
a
piece
of
gold
into
his
hand
and
having
again
blindfolded
him
conducted
him
back
to
his
dwelling
are
you
willing
said
he
to
return
and
complete
your
work
gladly
señor
padre
provided
i
am
so
well
well
then
at
midnight
i
will
call
he
did
so
and
the
vault
was
completed
now
said
the
priest
you
must
help
me
to
bring
forth
the
bodies
that
are
to
be
buried
in
this
the
poor
mason
s
hair
rose
on
his
head
at
these
words
he
followed
the
priest
with
trembling
steps
into
a
retired
chamber
of
the
mansion
expecting
to
behold
some
ghastly
spectacle
of
death
but
was
relieved
on
perceiving
three
or
four
portly
jars
standing
in
one
corner
they
were
evidently
full
of
money
and
it
was
with
great
labor
that
he
and
the
priest
carried
them
forth
and
consigned
them
to
their
tomb
the
vault
was
then
closed
the
pavement
replaced
and
all
traces
of
the
work
were
obliterated
the
mason
was
again
hoodwinked
and
led
forth
by
a
route
different
from
that
by
which
he
had
come
after
they
had
wandered
for
a
long
time
through
a
perplexed
maze
of
lanes
and
alleys
they
halted
the
priest
then
put
two
pieces
of
gold
into
his
hand
wait
here
said
he
until
you
hear
the
cathedral
bell
toll
for
matins
if
you
presume
to
uncover
your
eyes
before
that
time
evil
will
befall
you
so
saying
he
departed
the
mason
waited
faithfully
amusing
himself
by
weighing
the
gold
pieces
in
his
hand
and
clinking
them
against
each
other
the
moment
the
cathedral
bell
rang
its
matin
peal
he
uncovered
his
eyes
and
found
himself
on
the
banks
of
the
xenil
whence
he
made
the
best
of
his
way
home
and
revelled
with
his
family
for
a
whole
fortnight
on
the
profits
of
his
two
nights
work
after
which
he
was
as
poor
as
ever
he
continued
to
work
a
little
and
pray
a
good
deal
and
keep
saints
days
and
holidays
from
year
to
year
while
his
family
grew
up
as
gaunt
and
ragged
as
a
crew
of
gypsies
as
he
was
seated
one
evening
at
the
door
of
his
hovel
he
was
accosted
by
a
rich
old
curmudgeon
who
was
noted
for
owning
many
houses
and
being
a
griping
landlord
the
man
of
money
eyed
him
for
a
moment
from
beneath
a
pair
of
anxious
shagged
eyebrows
i
am
told
friend
that
you
are
very
there
is
no
denying
the
fact
señor
it
speaks
for
i
presume
then
that
you
will
be
glad
of
a
job
and
will
work
as
cheap
my
master
as
any
mason
in
that
s
what
i
want
i
have
an
old
house
fallen
into
decay
which
costs
me
more
money
than
it
is
worth
to
keep
it
in
repair
for
nobody
will
live
in
it
so
i
must
contrive
to
patch
it
up
and
keep
it
together
at
as
small
expense
as
the
mason
was
accordingly
conducted
to
a
large
deserted
house
that
seemed
going
to
ruin
passing
through
several
empty
halls
and
chambers
he
entered
an
inner
court
where
his
eye
was
caught
by
an
old
moorish
fountain
he
paused
for
a
moment
for
a
dreaming
recollection
of
the
place
came
over
him
pray
said
he
who
occupied
this
house
formerly
a
pest
upon
him
cried
the
landlord
it
was
an
old
miserly
priest
who
cared
for
nobody
but
himself
he
was
said
to
be
immensely
rich
and
having
no
relations
it
was
thought
he
would
leave
all
his
treasures
to
the
church
he
died
suddenly
and
the
priests
and
friars
thronged
to
take
possession
of
his
wealth
but
nothing
could
they
find
but
a
few
ducats
in
a
leathern
purse
the
worst
luck
has
fallen
on
me
for
since
his
death
the
old
fellow
continues
to
occupy
my
house
without
paying
rent
and
there
is
no
taking
the
law
of
a
dead
man
the
people
pretend
to
hear
the
clinking
of
gold
all
night
in
the
chamber
where
the
old
priest
slept
as
if
he
were
counting
over
his
money
and
sometimes
a
groaning
and
moaning
about
the
court
whether
true
or
false
these
stories
have
brought
a
bad
name
on
my
house
and
not
a
tenant
will
remain
in
enough
said
the
mason
sturdily
let
me
live
in
your
house
until
some
better
tenant
present
and
i
will
engage
to
put
it
in
repair
and
to
quiet
the
troubled
spirit
that
disturbs
it
i
am
a
good
christian
and
a
poor
man
and
am
not
to
be
daunted
by
the
devil
himself
even
though
he
should
come
in
the
shape
of
a
big
bag
of
money
the
offer
of
the
honest
mason
was
gladly
accepted
he
moved
with
his
family
into
the
house
and
fulfilled
all
his
engagements
by
little
and
little
he
restored
it
to
its
former
state
the
clinking
of
gold
was
no
more
heard
at
night
in
the
chamber
of
the
defunct
priest
but
began
to
be
heard
by
day
in
the
pocket
of
the
living
mason
in
a
word
he
increased
rapidly
in
wealth
to
the
admiration
of
all
his
neighbors
and
became
one
of
the
richest
men
in
granada
he
gave
large
sums
to
the
church
by
way
no
doubt
of
satisfying
his
conscience
and
never
revealed
the
secret
of
the
vault
until
on
his
to
his
son
and
the
court
of
lions
the
peculiar
charm
of
this
old
dreamy
palace
is
its
power
of
calling
up
vague
reveries
and
picturings
of
the
past
and
thus
clothing
naked
realities
with
the
illusions
of
the
memory
and
the
imagination
as
i
delight
to
walk
in
these
vain
shadows
i
am
prone
to
seek
those
parts
of
the
alhambra
which
are
most
favorable
to
this
phantasmagoria
of
the
mind
and
none
are
more
so
than
the
court
of
lions
and
its
surrounding
halls
here
the
hand
of
time
has
fallen
the
lightest
and
the
traces
of
moorish
elegance
and
splendor
exist
in
almost
their
original
brilliancy
earthquakes
have
shaken
the
foundations
of
this
pile
and
rent
its
rudest
towers
yet
see
not
one
of
those
slender
columns
has
been
displaced
not
an
arch
of
that
light
and
fragile
colonnade
given
way
and
all
the
fairy
fretwork
of
these
domes
apparently
as
unsubstantial
as
the
crystal
fabrics
of
a
morning
s
frost
exist
after
the
lapse
of
centuries
almost
as
fresh
as
if
from
the
hand
of
the
moslem
artist
i
write
in
the
midst
of
these
mementos
of
the
past
in
the
fresh
hour
of
early
morning
in
the
fated
hall
of
the
abencerrages
the
fountain
the
legendary
monument
of
their
massacre
is
before
me
the
lofty
jet
almost
casts
its
dew
upon
my
paper
how
difficult
to
reconcile
the
ancient
tale
of
violence
and
blood
with
the
gentle
and
peaceful
scene
around
everything
here
appears
calculated
to
inspire
kind
and
happy
feelings
for
everything
is
delicate
and
beautiful
the
very
light
falls
tenderly
from
above
through
the
lantern
of
a
dome
tinted
and
wrought
as
if
by
fairy
hands
through
the
ample
and
fretted
arch
of
the
portal
i
behold
the
court
of
lions
with
brilliant
sunshine
gleaming
along
its
colonnades
and
sparkling
in
its
fountains
the
lively
swallow
dives
into
the
court
and
rising
with
a
surge
darts
away
twittering
over
the
roofs
the
busy
bee
toils
humming
among
the
and
painted
butterflies
hover
from
plant
to
plant
and
flutter
up
and
sport
with
each
other
in
the
sunny
air
it
needs
but
a
slight
exertion
of
the
fancy
to
picture
some
pensive
beauty
of
the
harem
loitering
in
these
secluded
haunts
of
oriental
luxury
he
however
who
would
behold
this
scene
under
an
aspect
more
in
unison
with
its
fortunes
let
him
come
when
the
shadows
of
evening
temper
the
brightness
of
the
court
and
throw
a
gloom
into
the
surrounding
halls
then
nothing
can
be
more
serenely
melancholy
or
more
in
harmony
with
the
tale
of
departed
grandeur
at
such
times
i
am
apt
to
seek
the
hall
of
justice
whose
deep
shadowy
arcades
extend
across
the
upper
end
of
the
court
here
was
performed
in
presence
of
ferdinand
and
isabella
and
their
triumphant
court
the
pompous
ceremonial
of
high
mass
on
taking
possession
of
the
alhambra
the
very
cross
is
still
to
be
seen
upon
the
wall
where
the
altar
was
erected
and
where
officiated
the
grand
cardinal
of
spain
and
others
of
the
highest
religious
dignitaries
of
the
land
i
picture
to
myself
the
scene
when
this
place
was
filled
with
the
conquering
host
that
mixture
of
mitred
prelate
and
shaven
monk
and
knight
and
silken
illustration
fountain
of
lions
courtier
when
crosses
and
crosiers
and
religious
standards
were
mingled
with
proud
armorial
ensigns
and
the
banners
of
the
haughty
chiefs
of
spain
and
flaunted
in
triumph
through
these
moslem
halls
i
picture
to
myself
columbus
the
future
discoverer
of
a
world
taking
his
modest
stand
in
a
remote
corner
the
humble
and
neglected
spectator
of
the
pageant
i
see
in
imagination
the
catholic
sovereigns
prostrating
themselves
before
the
altar
and
pouring
forth
thanks
for
their
victory
while
the
vaults
resound
with
sacred
minstrelsy
and
the
te
deum
the
transient
illusion
is
over
the
pageant
melts
from
the
fancy
monarch
priest
and
warrior
return
into
oblivion
with
the
poor
moslems
over
whom
they
exulted
the
hall
of
their
triumph
is
waste
and
desolate
the
bat
flits
about
its
twilight
vault
and
the
owl
hoots
from
the
neighboring
tower
of
comares
entering
the
court
of
the
lions
a
few
evenings
since
i
was
almost
startled
at
beholding
a
turbaned
moor
quietly
seated
near
the
fountain
for
a
moment
one
of
the
fictions
of
the
place
seemed
realized
an
enchanted
moor
had
broken
the
spell
of
centuries
and
become
visible
he
proved
however
to
be
a
mere
ordinary
mortal
a
native
of
tetuan
in
barbary
who
had
a
shop
in
the
zacatin
of
granada
where
he
sold
rhubarb
trinkets
and
perfumes
as
he
spoke
spanish
fluently
i
was
enabled
to
hold
conversation
with
him
and
found
him
shrewd
and
intelligent
he
told
me
that
he
came
up
the
hill
occasionally
in
the
summer
to
pass
a
part
of
the
day
in
the
alhambra
which
reminded
him
of
the
old
palaces
in
barbary
being
built
and
adorned
in
similar
style
though
with
more
magnificence
as
we
walked
about
the
palace
he
pointed
out
several
of
the
arabic
inscriptions
as
possessing
much
poetic
beauty
ah
señor
said
he
when
the
moors
held
granada
they
were
a
gayer
people
than
they
are
nowadays
they
thought
only
of
love
music
and
poetry
they
made
stanzas
upon
every
occasion
and
set
them
all
to
music
he
who
could
make
the
best
verses
and
she
who
had
the
most
tuneful
voice
might
be
sure
of
favor
and
preferment
in
those
days
if
any
one
asked
for
bread
the
reply
was
make
me
a
couplet
and
the
poorest
beggar
if
he
begged
in
rhyme
would
often
be
rewarded
with
a
piece
of
and
is
the
popular
feeling
for
poetry
said
i
entirely
lost
among
you
by
no
means
señor
the
people
of
barbary
even
those
of
the
lower
classes
still
make
couplets
and
good
ones
too
as
in
old
times
but
talent
is
not
rewarded
as
it
was
then
the
rich
prefer
the
jingle
of
their
gold
to
the
sound
of
poetry
or
as
he
was
talking
his
eye
caught
one
of
the
inscriptions
which
foretold
perpetuity
to
the
power
and
glory
of
the
moslem
monarchs
the
masters
of
this
pile
he
shook
his
head
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
he
interpreted
it
such
might
have
been
the
case
said
he
the
moslems
might
still
have
been
reigning
in
the
alhambra
had
not
boabdil
been
a
traitor
and
given
up
his
capital
to
the
christians
the
spanish
monarchs
would
never
have
been
able
to
conquer
it
by
open
i
endeavored
to
vindicate
the
memory
of
the
unlucky
boabdil
from
this
aspersion
and
to
show
that
the
dissensions
which
led
to
the
downfall
of
the
moorish
throne
originated
in
the
cruelty
of
his
father
but
the
moor
would
admit
of
no
palliation

said
he
might
have
been
cruel
but
he
was
brave
vigilant
and
patriotic
had
he
been
properly
seconded
granada
would
still
have
been
ours
but
his
son
boabdil
thwarted
his
plans
crippled
his
power
sowed
treason
in
his
palace
and
dissension
in
his
camp
may
the
curse
of
god
light
upon
him
for
his
treachery
with
these
words
the
moor
left
the
alhambra
the
indignation
of
my
turbaned
companion
agrees
with
an
anecdote
related
by
a
friend
who
in
the
course
of
a
tour
in
barbary
had
an
interview
with
the
pacha
of
tetuan
the
moorish
governor
was
particular
in
his
inquiries
about
spain
and
especially
concerning
the
favored
region
of
andalusia
the
delights
of
granada
and
the
remains
of
its
royal
palace
the
replies
awakened
all
those
fond
recollections
so
deeply
cherished
by
the
moors
of
the
power
and
splendor
of
their
ancient
empire
in
spain
turning
to
his
moslem
attendants
the
pacha
stroked
his
beard
and
broke
forth
in
passionate
lamentations
that
such
a
sceptre
should
have
fallen
from
the
sway
of
true
believers
he
consoled
himself
however
with
the
persuasion
that
the
power
and
prosperity
of
the
spanish
nation
were
on
the
decline
that
a
time
would
come
when
the
moors
would
conquer
their
rightful
domains
and
that
the
day
was
perhaps
not
far
distant
when
mohammedan
worship
would
again
be
offered
up
in
the
mosque
of
cordova
and
a
mohammedan
prince
sit
on
his
throne
in
the
alhambra
such
is
the
general
aspiration
and
belief
among
the
moors
of
barbary
who
consider
spain
or
andaluz
as
it
was
anciently
called
their
rightful
heritage
of
which
they
have
been
despoiled
by
treachery
and
violence
these
ideas
are
fostered
and
perpetuated
by
the
descendants
of
the
exiled
moors
of
granada
scattered
among
the
cities
of
barbary
several
of
these
reside
in
tetuan
preserving
their
ancient
names
such
as
paez
and
medina
and
refraining
from
with
any
families
who
can
not
claim
the
same
high
origin
their
vaunted
lineage
is
regarded
with
a
degree
of
popular
deference
rarely
shown
in
mohammedan
communities
to
any
hereditary
distinction
excepting
in
the
royal
line
these
families
it
is
said
continue
to
sigh
after
the
terrestrial
paradise
of
their
ancestors
and
to
put
up
prayers
in
their
mosques
on
fridays
imploring
allah
to
hasten
the
time
when
granada
shall
be
restored
to
the
faithful
an
event
to
which
they
look
forward
as
fondly
and
confidently
as
did
the
christian
crusaders
to
the
recovery
of
the
holy
sepulchre
nay
it
is
added
that
some
of
them
retain
the
ancient
maps
and
deeds
of
the
estates
and
gardens
of
their
ancestors
at
granada
and
even
the
keys
of
the
houses
holding
them
as
evidences
of
their
hereditary
claims
to
be
produced
at
the
anticipated
day
of
restoration
my
conversation
with
the
moors
set
me
to
musing
on
the
fate
of
boabdil
never
was
surname
more
applicable
than
that
bestowed
upon
him
by
his
subjects
of
el
zogoybi
or
the
unlucky
his
misfortunes
began
almost
in
his
cradle
and
ceased
not
even
with
his
death
if
ever
he
cherished
the
desire
of
leaving
an
honorable
name
on
the
historic
page
how
cruelly
has
he
been
defrauded
of
his
hopes
who
is
there
that
has
turned
the
least
attention
to
the
romantic
history
of
the
moorish
domination
in
spain
without
kindling
with
indignation
at
the
alleged
atrocities
of
boabdil
who
has
not
been
touched
with
the
woes
of
his
lovely
and
gentle
queen
subjected
by
him
to
a
trial
of
life
and
death
on
a
false
charge
of
infidelity
who
has
not
been
shocked
by
his
alleged
murder
of
his
sister
and
her
two
children
in
a
transport
of
passion
who
has
not
felt
his
blood
boil
at
the
inhuman
massacre
of
the
gallant
abencerrages
of
whom
it
is
affirmed
he
ordered
to
be
beheaded
in
the
court
of
lions
all
these
charges
have
been
reiterated
in
various
forms
they
have
passed
into
ballads
dramas
and
romances
until
they
have
taken
too
thorough
possession
of
the
public
mind
to
be
eradicated
there
is
not
a
foreigner
of
education
that
visits
the
alhambra
but
asks
for
the
fountain
where
the
abencerrages
were
beheaded
and
gazes
with
horror
at
the
grated
gallery
where
the
queen
is
said
to
have
been
confined
not
a
peasant
of
the
vega
or
the
sierra
but
sings
the
story
in
rude
couplets
to
the
accompaniment
of
his
guitar
while
his
hearers
learn
to
execrate
the
very
name
of
boabdil
never
however
was
name
more
foully
and
unjustly
slandered
i
have
examined
all
the
authentic
chronicles
and
letters
written
by
spanish
authors
contemporary
with
boabdil
some
of
whom
were
in
the
confidence
of
the
catholic
sovereigns
and
actually
present
in
the
camp
throughout
the
war
i
have
examined
all
the
arabian
authorities
i
could
get
access
to
through
the
medium
of
translation
and
have
found
nothing
to
justify
these
dark
and
hateful
accusations
the
most
of
these
tales
may
be
traced
to
a
work
commonly
called
the
civil
wars
of
granada
containing
a
pretended
history
of
the
feuds
of
the
zegries
and
abencerrages
during
the
last
struggle
of
the
moorish
empire
the
work
appeared
originally
in
spanish
and
professed
to
be
translated
from
the
arabic
by
one
gines
perez
de
hita
an
inhabitant
of
murcia
it
has
since
passed
into
various
languages
and
florian
has
taken
from
it
much
of
the
fable
of
his
gonsalvo
of
cordova
it
has
thus
in
a
great
measure
usurped
the
authority
of
real
history
and
is
currently
believed
by
the
people
and
especially
the
peasantry
of
granada
the
whole
of
it
however
is
a
mass
of
fiction
mingled
with
a
few
disfigured
truths
which
give
it
an
air
of
veracity
it
bears
internal
evidence
of
its
falsity
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
moors
being
extravagantly
misrepresented
in
it
and
scenes
depicted
totally
incompatible
with
their
habits
and
their
faith
and
which
never
could
have
been
recorded
by
a
mahometan
writer
i
confess
there
seems
to
me
something
almost
criminal
in
the
wilful
perversions
of
this
work
great
latitude
is
undoubtedly
to
be
allowed
to
romantic
fiction
but
there
are
limits
which
it
must
not
pass
and
the
names
of
the
distinguished
dead
which
belong
to
history
are
no
more
to
be
calumniated
than
those
of
the
illustrious
living
one
would
have
thought
too
that
the
unfortunate
boabdil
had
suffered
enough
for
his
justifiable
hostility
to
the
spaniards
by
being
stripped
of
his
kingdom
without
having
his
name
thus
wantonly
traduced
and
rendered
a
and
a
theme
of
infamy
in
his
native
land
and
in
the
very
mansion
of
his
fathers
if
the
reader
is
sufficiently
interested
in
these
questions
to
tolerate
a
little
historical
detail
the
following
facts
gleaned
from
what
appear
to
be
authentic
sources
and
tracing
the
fortunes
of
the
abencerrages
may
serve
to
exculpate
the
unfortunate
boabdil
from
the
perfidious
massacre
of
that
illustrious
line
so
shamelessly
charged
to
him
it
will
also
serve
to
throw
a
proper
light
upon
the
alleged
accusation
and
imprisonment
of
his
queen
the
abencerrages
a
grand
line
of
distinction
existed
among
the
moslems
of
spain
between
those
of
oriental
origin
and
those
from
western
africa
among
the
former
the
arabs
considered
themselves
the
purest
race
as
being
descended
from
the
countrymen
of
the
prophet
who
first
raised
the
standard
of
islam
among
the
latter
the
most
warlike
and
powerful
were
the
berber
tribes
from
mount
atlas
and
the
deserts
of
sahara
commonly
known
as
moors
who
subdued
the
tribes
of
the
seacoast
founded
the
city
of
morocco
and
for
a
long
time
disputed
with
the
oriental
races
the
control
of
moslem
spain
among
the
oriental
races
the
abencerrages
held
a
distinguished
rank
priding
themselves
on
a
pure
arab
descent
from
the
beni
seraj
one
of
the
tribes
who
were
ansares
or
companions
of
the
prophet
the
abencerrages
flourished
for
a
time
at
cordova
but
probably
repaired
to
granada
after
the
downfall
of
the
western
caliphat
it
was
there
they
attained
their
historical
and
romantic
celebrity
being
foremost
among
the
splendid
chivalry
which
graced
the
court
of
the
alhambra
their
highest
and
most
dangerous
prosperity
was
during
the
precarious
reign
of
muhamed
nasar
surnamed
el
hayzari
or
the
that
monarch
when
he
ascended
the
throne
in
lavished
his
favors
upon
this
gallant
line
making
the
head
of
the
tribe
jusef
aben
zeragh
his
vizier
or
prime
minister
and
advancing
his
relatives
and
friends
to
the
most
distinguished
posts
about
the
court
this
gave
great
offence
to
other
tribes
and
caused
intrigues
among
their
chiefs
muhamed
lost
popularity
also
by
his
manners
he
was
vain
inconsiderate
and
haughty
disdained
to
mingle
among
his
subjects
forbade
those
jousts
and
tournaments
the
delight
of
high
and
low
and
passed
his
time
in
the
luxurious
retirement
of
the
alhambra
the
consequence
was
a
popular
insurrection
the
palace
was
stormed
the
king
escaped
through
the
gardens
fled
to
the
crossed
in
disguise
to
africa
and
took
refuge
with
his
kinsman
the
sovereign
of
tunis
muhamed
el
zaguer
cousin
of
the
fugitive
monarch
took
possession
of
the
vacant
throne
he
pursued
a
different
course
from
his
predecessor
he
not
only
gave
fêtes
and
tourneys
but
entered
the
lists
himself
in
grand
and
sumptuous
array
he
distinguished
himself
in
managing
his
horse
in
tilting
riding
at
the
ring
and
other
chivalrous
exercises
feasted
with
his
cavaliers
and
made
them
magnificent
presents
those
who
had
been
in
favor
with
his
predecessor
now
experienced
a
reverse
he
manifested
such
hostility
to
them
that
more
than
five
hundred
of
the
principal
cavaliers
left
the
city
jusef
aben
zeragh
with
forty
of
the
abencerrages
abandoned
granada
in
the
night
and
sought
the
court
of
juan
the
king
of
castile
moved
by
their
representations
that
young
and
generous
monarch
wrote
letters
to
the
sovereign
of
tunis
inviting
him
to
assist
in
punishing
the
usurper
and
restoring
the
exiled
king
to
his
throne
the
faithful
and
indefatigable
vizier
accompanied
the
bearer
of
these
letters
to
tunis
where
he
rejoined
his
exiled
sovereign
the
letters
were
successful
muhamed
el
hayzari
landed
in
andalusia
with
five
hundred
african
horse
and
was
joined
by
the
abencerrages
and
others
of
his
adherents
and
by
his
christian
allies
wherever
he
appeared
the
people
submitted
to
him
troops
sent
against
him
deserted
to
his
standard
granada
was
recovered
without
a
blow
the
usurper
retreated
to
the
alhambra
but
was
beheaded
by
his
own
soldiers
after
reigning
between
two
and
three
years
el
hayzari
once
more
on
the
throne
heaped
honors
on
the
loyal
vizier
through
whose
faithful
services
he
had
been
restored
and
once
more
the
line
of
the
abencerrages
basked
in
the
sunshine
of
royal
favor
el
hayzari
sent
ambassadors
to
king
juan
thanking
him
for
his
aid
and
proposing
a
perpetual
league
of
amity
the
king
of
castile
required
homage
and
yearly
tribute
these
the
monarch
refused
supposing
the
youthful
king
too
much
engaged
in
civil
war
to
enforce
his
claims
again
the
kingdom
of
granada
was
harassed
by
invasions
and
its
vega
laid
waste
various
battles
took
place
with
various
success
but
el
hayzari
s
greatest
danger
was
near
at
home
there
was
at
that
time
in
granada
a
cavalier
don
pedro
venegas
by
name
a
moslem
by
faith
but
christian
by
descent
whose
early
history
borders
on
romance
he
was
of
the
noble
house
of
luque
but
captured
when
a
child
eight
years
of
age
by
cid
yahia
alnayar
prince
of
almeria
who
adopted
him
as
his
son
educated
him
in
the
moslem
faith
and
brought
him
up
among
his
children
the
celtimerian
princes
a
proud
family
descended
in
direct
line
from
aben
hud
one
of
the
early
granadian
kings
a
mutual
attachment
sprang
up
between
don
pedro
and
the
princess
cetimerien
a
daughter
of
cid
yahia
famous
for
her
beauty
and
whose
name
is
perpetuated
by
the
ruins
of
her
palace
in
granada
still
bearing
traces
of
moorish
elegance
and
luxury
in
process
of
time
they
were
married
and
thus
a
scion
of
the
spanish
house
of
luque
became
engrafted
on
the
royal
stock
of
aben
hud
such
is
the
early
story
of
don
pedro
venegas
who
at
the
time
of
which
we
treat
was
a
man
mature
in
years
and
of
an
active
ambitious
spirit
he
appears
to
have
been
the
soul
of
a
conspiracy
set
on
foot
about
this
time
to
topple
muhamed
the
from
his
unsteady
throne
and
elevate
in
his
place
yusef
aben
alhamar
the
eldest
of
the
celtimerian
princes
the
aid
of
the
king
of
castile
was
to
be
secured
and
don
pedro
proceeded
on
a
secret
embassy
to
cordova
for
the
purpose
he
informed
king
juan
of
the
extent
of
the
conspiracy
that
yusef
aben
alhamar
could
bring
a
large
force
to
his
standard
as
soon
as
he
should
appear
in
the
vega
and
would
acknowledge
himself
his
vassal
if
with
his
aid
he
should
attain
the
crown
the
aid
was
promised
and
don
pedro
hastened
back
to
granada
with
the
tidings
the
conspirators
now
left
the
city
a
few
at
a
time
under
various
pretexts
and
when
king
juan
passed
the
frontier
yusef
aben
alhamar
brought
eight
thousand
men
to
his
standard
and
kissed
his
hand
in
token
of
allegiance
it
is
needless
to
recount
the
various
battles
by
which
the
kingdom
was
desolated
and
the
various
intrigues
by
which
one
half
of
it
was
roused
to
rebellion
the
abencerrages
stood
by
the
failing
fortunes
of
muhamed
throughout
the
struggle
their
last
stand
was
at
loxa
where
their
chief
the
vizier
yusef
aben
zeragh
fell
bravely
fighting
and
many
of
their
noblest
cavaliers
were
slain
in
fact
in
that
disastrous
war
the
fortunes
of
the
family
were
nearly
wrecked
again
the
muhamed
was
driven
from
his
throne
and
took
refuge
in
malaga
the
alcayde
of
which
still
remained
true
to
him
yusef
aben
alhamar
commonly
known
as
yusef
entered
granada
in
triumph
on
the
first
of
january
but
he
found
it
a
melancholy
city
where
half
of
the
inhabitants
were
in
mourning
not
a
noble
family
but
had
lost
some
member
and
in
the
slaughter
of
the
abencerrages
at
loxa
had
fallen
some
of
the
brightest
of
the
chivalry
the
royal
pageant
passed
through
silent
streets
and
the
barren
homage
of
a
court
in
the
halls
of
the
alhambra
ill
supplied
the
want
of
sincere
and
popular
devotion
yusef
aben
alhamar
felt
the
insecurity
of
his
position
the
deposed
monarch
was
at
hand
in
malaga
the
sovereign
of
tunis
espoused
his
cause
and
pleaded
with
the
christian
monarchs
in
his
favor
above
all
yusef
felt
his
own
unpopularity
in
granada
previous
fatigues
had
impaired
his
health
a
profound
melancholy
settled
upon
him
and
in
the
course
of
six
months
he
sank
into
the
grave
at
the
news
of
his
death
muhamed
the
hastened
from
malaga
and
again
was
placed
on
the
throne
from
the
wrecks
of
the
abencerrages
he
chose
as
vizier
abdelbar
one
of
the
worthiest
of
that
magnanimous
line
through
his
advice
he
restrained
his
vindictive
feelings
and
adopted
a
conciliatory
policy
he
pardoned
most
of
his
enemies
yusef
the
defunct
usurper
had
left
three
children
his
estates
were
apportioned
among
them
aben

the
eldest
son
was
confirmed
in
the
title
of
prince
of

and
lord
of

the
youngest

made

patrimonial
lands
in
the
fertile

and
various
houses
and
shops
in
the
zacatin
of

the
vizier
abdelbar
counselled
the
king
moreover
to
secure
the
adherence
of
the
family
by
matrimonial
connections
an
aunt
of
muhamed
was
accordingly
given
in
marriage
to
aben

faithful
adherent
the
alcayde
of
malaga
this
was
the
lindaraxa
whose
name
still
designates
one
of
the
gardens
of
the
alhambra
don
pedro
de
venegas
alone
the
husband
of
the
princess
cetimerien
received
no
favor
he
was
considered
as
having
produced
the
late
troubles
by
his
intrigues
the
abencerrages
charged
him
with
the
reverses
of
their
family
and
the
deaths
of
so
many
of
their
bravest
cavaliers
the
king
never
spoke
of
him
but
by
the
opprobrious
appellation
of
the
tornadizo
or
renegade
finding
himself
in
danger
of
arrest
and
punishment
he
took
leave
of
his
wife
the
princess
his
two
sons
abul
cacim
and
reduan
and
his
daughter
cetimerien
and
fled
to
jaen
there
like
his
the
usurper
he
expiated
his
intrigues
and
irregular
ambition
by
profound
humiliation
and
melancholy
and
died
in
a
penitent
because
a
disappointed
man
muhamed
el
hayzari
was
doomed
to
further
reverses
he
had
two
nephews
aben
osmyn
surnamed
el
anaf
or
the
lame
and
aben
ismael
the
former
who
was
of
an
ambitious
spirit
resided
in
almeria
the
latter
in
granada
where
he
had
many
friends
he
was
on
the
point
of
espousing
a
beautiful
girl
when
his
royal
uncle
interfered
and
gave
her
to
one
of
his
favorites
enraged
at
this
despotic
act
the
prince
aben
ismael
took
horse
and
weapons
and
sallied
from
granada
for
the
frontier
followed
by
numerous
cavaliers
the
affair
gave
general
disgust
especially
to
the
abencerrages
who
were
attached
to
the
prince
no
sooner
did
tidings
reach
aben
osmyn
of
the
public
discontent
than
his
ambition
was
aroused
throwing
himself
suddenly
into
granada
he
raised
a
popular
tumult
surprised
his
uncle
in
the
alhambra
compelled
him
to
abdicate
and
proclaimed
himself
king
this
occurred
in
september
the
abencerrages
now
gave
up
the
fortunes
of
the
king
as
hopeless
and
himself
as
incompetent
to
rule
led
by
their
kinsman
the
vizier
abdelbar
and
accompanied
by
many
other
cavaliers
they
abandoned
the
court
and
took
post
in
montefrio
thence
abdelbar
wrote
to
prince
aben
ismael
who
had
taken
refuge
in
castile
inviting
him
to
the
camp
offering
to
support
his
pretensions
to
the
throne
and
advising
him
to
leave
castile
secretly
lest
his
departure
should
be
opposed
by
king
juan
ii
the
prince
however
confiding
in
the
generosity
of
the
castilian
monarch
told
frankly
the
whole
matter
he
was
not
mistaken
king
juan
not
merely
gave
him
permission
to
depart
but
promised
him
aid
and
gave
him
letters
to
that
effect
to
his
commanders
on
the
frontiers
aben
ismael
departed
with
a
brilliant
escort
arrived
in
safety
at
montefrio
and
was
proclaimed
king
of
granada
by
abdelbar
and
his
partisans
the
most
important
of
whom
were
the
abencerrages
a
long
course
of
civil
wars
ensued
between
the
two
cousins
rivals
for
the
throne
aben
osmyn
was
aided
by
the
kings
of
navarre
and
aragon
while
juan
at
war
with
his
rebellious
subjects
could
give
little
assistance
to
aben
ismael
thus
for
several
years
the
country
was
torn
by
internal
strife
and
desolated
by
foreign
inroads
so
that
scarce
a
field
but
was
stained
with
blood
aben
osmyn
was
brave
and
often
signalized
himself
in
arms
but
he
was
cruel
and
despotic
and
ruled
with
an
iron
hand
he
offended
the
nobles
by
his
caprices
and
the
populace
by
his
tyranny
while
his
rival
cousin
conciliated
all
hearts
of
his
benignity
hence
there
were
continual
desertions
from
granada
to
the
fortified
camp
at
montefrio
and
the
party
of
aben
ismael
was
constantly
gaining
strength
at
length
the
king
of
castile
having
made
peace
with
the
kings
of
aragon
and
navarre
was
enabled
to
send
a
choice
body
of
troops
to
the
assistance
of
aben
ismael
the
latter
now
left
his
trenches
in
montefrio
and
took
the
field
the
combined
forces
marched
upon
granada
aben
osmyn
sallied
forth
to
the
encounter
a
bloody
battle
ensued
in
which
both
of
the
rival
cousins
fought
with
heroic
valor
aben
osmyn
was
defeated
and
driven
back
to
his
gates
he
summoned
the
inhabitants
to
arms
but
few
answered
to
his
call
his
cruelty
had
alienated
all
hearts
seeing
his
fortunes
at
an
end
he
determined
to
close
his
career
by
a
signal
act
of
vengeance
shutting
himself
up
in
the
alhambra
he
summoned
thither
a
number
of
the
principal
cavaliers
whom
he
suspected
of
disloyalty
as
they
entered
they
were
one
by
one
put
to
death
this
is
supposed
by
some
to
be
the
massacre
which
gave
its
fatal
name
to
the
hall
of
the
abencerrages
having
perpetrated
this
atrocious
act
of
vengeance
and
hearing
by
the
shouts
of
the
populace
that
aben
ismael
was
already
proclaimed
king
in
the
city
he
escaped
with
his
satellites
by
the
cerro
del
sol
and
the
valley
of
the
darro
to
the
alpuxarra
mountains
where
he
and
his
followers
led
a
kind
of
robber
life
laying
villages
and
roads
under
contribution
aben
ismael
who
thus
attained
the
throne
in
secured
the
friendship
of
king
juan
ii
by
acts
of
homage
and
magnificent
presents
he
gave
liberal
rewards
to
those
who
had
been
faithful
to
him
and
consoled
the
families
of
those
who
had
fallen
in
his
cause
during
his
reign
the
abencerrages
were
again
among
the
most
favored
of
the
brilliant
chivalry
that
graced
his
court
aben
ismael
however
was
not
of
a
warlike
spirit
his
reign
was
distinguished
rather
by
works
of
public
utility
the
ruins
of
some
of
which
are
still
to
be
seen
on
the
cerro
del
sol
in
the
same
year
of
juan
ii
died
and
was
succeeded
by
henry
iv
of
castile
surnamed
the
impotent
aben
ismael
neglected
to
renew
the
league
of
amity
with
him
which
had
existed
with
his
predecessor
as
he
found
it
to
be
unpopular
with
the
people
of
granada
king
henry
resented
the
omissions
and
under
pretext
of
arrears
of
tribute
made
repeated
forays
into
the
kingdom
of
granada
he
gave
countenance
also
to
aben
osmyn
and
his
robber
hordes
and
took
some
of
them
into
pay
but
his
proud
cavaliers
refused
to
associate
with
infidel
outlaws
and
determined
to
seize
aben
osmyn
who
however
made
his
escape
first
to
seville
and
thence
to
castile
in
the
year
on
the
occasion
of
a
great
foray
into
the
vega
by
the
christians
aben
ismael
to
secure
a
peace
agreed
to
pay
the
king
of
castile
a
certain
tribute
annually
and
at
the
same
time
to
liberate
six
hundred
christian
captives
or
should
the
number
of
captives
fall
short
to
make
it
up
in
moorish
hostages
aben
ismael
fulfilled
the
rigorous
terms
of
the
treaty
and
reigned
for
a
number
of
years
with
more
tranquillity
than
usually
fell
to
the
lot
of
the
monarchs
of
that
belligerent
kingdom
granada
enjoyed
a
great
state
of
prosperity
during
his
reign
and
was
the
seat
of
festivity
and
splendor
his
sultana
was
a
daughter
of
cid
hiaya
abraham
alnayar
prince
of
almeria
and
he
had
by
her
two
sons
abul
hassan
and
abi
abdallah
surnamed
el
zagal
the
father
and
uncle
of
boabdil
we
approach
now
the
eventful
period
signalized
by
the
conquest
of
granada
muley
abul
hassan
succeeded
to
the
throne
on
the
death
of
his
father
in
one
of
his
first
acts
was
to
refuse
payment
of
the
degrading
tribute
exacted
by
the
castilian
monarch
his
refusal
was
one
of
the
causes
of
the
subsequent
disastrous
war
i
confine
myself
however
to
facts
connected
with
the
fortunes
of
the
abencerrages
and
the
charges
advanced
against
boabdil
the
reader
will
recollect
that
don
pedro
venegas
surnamed
el
tornadizo
when
he
fled
from
granada
in
left
behind
him
two
sons
abul
cacim
and
reduan
and
a
daughter
cetimerien
they
always
enjoyed
a
distinguished
rank
in
granada
from
their
royal
descent
by
the
mother
s
side
and
from
being
connected
through
the
princes
of
almeria
with
the
last
and
the
present
king
the
sons
had
distinguished
themselves
by
their
talents
and
bravery
and
the
daughter
cetimerien
was
married
to
cid
hiaya
grandson
of
king
yusef
and
of
el
zagal
thus
powerfully
connected
it
is
not
surprising
to
find
abul
cacim
venegas
advanced
to
the
post
of
vizier
of
muley
abul
hassan
and
reduan
venegas
one
of
his
most
favored
generals
their
rise
was
regarded
with
an
evil
eye
by
the
abencerrages
who
remembered
the
disasters
brought
upon
their
family
and
the
deaths
of
so
many
of
their
line
in
the
war
fomented
by
the
intrigues
of
don
pedro
in
the
days
of
yusef
aben
alhamar
a
feud
had
existed
ever
since
between
the
abencerrages
and
the
house
of
venegas
it
was
soon
to
be
aggravated
by
a
formidable
schism
which
took
place
in
the
royal
harem
muley
abul
hassan
in
his
youthful
days
had
married
his
cousin
the
princess
ayxa
la
horra
daughter
of
his
uncle
the
sultan
muhamed
the
by
her
he
had
two
sons
the
eldest
of
whom
was
boabdil
heir
presumptive
to
the
throne
unfortunately
at
an
advanced
age
he
took
another
wife
isabella
de
solis
a
young
and
beautiful
christian
captive
better
known
by
her
moorish
appellation
of
zoraya
by
her
he
had
also
two
sons
two
factions
were
produced
in
the
palace
by
the
rivalry
of
the
sultanas
who
were
each
anxious
to
secure
for
their
children
the
succession
to
the
throne
zoraya
was
supported
by
the
vizier
abul
cacim
venegas
his
brother
reduan
venegas
and
their
numerous
connections
partly
through
sympathy
with
her
as
being
like
themselves
of
christian
lineage
and
partly
because
they
saw
she
was
the
favorite
of
the
doting
monarch
the
abencerrages
on
the
contrary
rallied
round
the
sultana
ayxa
partly
through
hereditary
opposition
to
the
family
of
venegas
but
chiefly
no
doubt
through
a
strong
feeling
of
loyalty
to
her
as
daughter
of
muhamed
alhayzari
the
ancient
benefactor
of
their
line
the
dissensions
of
the
palace
went
on
increasing
intrigues
of
all
kinds
took
place
as
is
usual
in
royal
palaces
suspicions
were
artfully
instilled
in
the
mind
of
muley
abul
hassan
that
ayxa
was
engaged
in
a
plot
to
depose
him
and
put
her
son
boabdil
on
the
throne
in
his
first
transports
of
rage
he
confined
them
both
in
the
tower
of
comares
threatening
the
life
of
boabdil
at
dead
of
night
the
anxious
mother
lowered
her
son
from
a
window
of
the
tower
by
the
scarfs
of
herself
and
her
female
attendants
and
some
of
her
adherents
who
were
in
waiting
with
swift
horses
bore
him
away
to
the
alpuxarras
it
is
this
imprisonment
of
the
sultana
ayxa
which
possibly
gave
rise
to
the
fable
of
the
queen
of
boabdil
being
confined
by
him
in
a
tower
to
be
tried
for
her
life
no
other
shadow
of
a
ground
exists
for
it
and
here
we
find
the
tyrant
jailer
was
his
father
and
the
captive
sultana
his
mother
the
massacre
of
the
abencerrages
in
the
halls
of
the
alhambra
is
placed
by
some
about
this
time
and
attributed
also
to
muley
abul
hassan
on
suspicion
of
their
being
concerned
in
the
conspiracy
the
sacrifice
of
a
number
of
the
cavaliers
of
that
line
is
said
to
have
been
suggested
by
the
vizier
abul
cacim
venegas
as
a
means
of
striking
terror
into
the
rest
if
such
were
really
the
case
the
barbarous
measure
proved
abortive
the
abencerrages
continued
intrepid
as
they
were
loyal
in
their
adherence
to
the
cause
of
ayxa
and
her
son
boabdil
throughout
the
war
which
ensued
while
the
venegas
were
ever
foremost
in
the
ranks
of
muley
abul
hassan
and
el
zagal
the
ultimate
fortunes
of
these
rival
families
is
worthy
of
note
the
venegas
in
the
last
struggle
of
granada
were
among
those
who
submitted
to
the
conquerors
renounced
the
moslem
creed
returned
to
the
faith
from
which
their
ancestor
had
apostatized
were
rewarded
with
offices
and
estates
intermarried
with
spanish
families
and
have
left
posterity
among
the
nobles
of
the
land
the
abencerrages
remained
true
to
their
faith
true
to
their
king
true
to
their
desperate
cause
and
went
down
with
the
foundering
wreck
of
moslem
domination
leaving
nothing
behind
them
but
a
gallant
and
romantic
name
in
history
in
this
historical
outline
i
trust
i
have
shown
enough
to
put
the
fable
concerning
boabdil
and
the
abencerrages
in
a
true
light
the
story
of
the
accusation
of
his
queen
and
his
cruelty
to
his
sister
are
equally
void
of
foundation
in
his
domestic
relations
he
appears
to
have
been
kind
and
affectionate
history
gives
him
but
one
wife
morayma
the
daughter
of
the
veteran
alcayde
of
loxa
old
aliatar
famous
in
song
and
story
for
his
exploits
in
border
warfare
and
who
fell
in
that
disastrous
foray
into
the
christian
lands
in
which
boabdil
was
taken
prisoner
morayma
was
true
to
boabdil
throughout
all
his
vicissitudes
when
he
was
dethroned
by
the
castilian
monarchs
she
retired
with
him
to
the
petty
domain
allotted
him
in
the
valleys
of
the
alpuxarras
it
was
only
when
dispossessed
of
this
by
the
jealous
precautions
and
subtle
chicanery
of
ferdinand
and
elbowed
as
it
were
out
of
his
native
land
he
was
preparing
to
embark
for
africa
that
her
health
and
spirits
exhausted
by
anxiety
and
long
suffering
gave
way
and
she
fell
into
a
lingering
illness
aggravated
by
corroding
melancholy
boabdil
was
constant
and
affectionate
to
her
to
the
last
the
sailing
of
the
ships
was
delayed
for
several
weeks
to
the
great
annoyance
of
the
suspicious
ferdinand
at
length
morayma
sank
into
the
grave
evidently
the
victim
of
a
broken
heart
and
the
event
was
reported
to
ferdinand
by
his
agent
as
one
propitious
to
his
purposes
removing
the
only
obstacle
to
the
embarkation
of
boabdil
mementos
of
boabdil
while
my
mind
was
still
warm
with
the
subject
of
the
unfortunate
boabdil
i
set
forth
to
trace
the
mementos
of
him
still
existing
in
this
scene
of
his
sovereignty
and
misfortunes
in
the
tower
of
comares
immediately
under
the
hall
of
ambassadors
are
two
vaulted
rooms
separated
by
a
narrow
passage
these
are
said
to
have
been
the
prisons
of
himself
and
his
mother
the
virtuous
ayxa
la
horra
indeed
no
other
part
of
the
tower
would
have
served
for
the
purpose
the
external
walls
of
these
chambers
are
of
prodigious
thickness
pierced
with
small
windows
secured
by
iron
bars
a
narrow
stone
gallery
with
a
low
parapet
extends
along
three
sides
of
the
tower
just
below
the
windows
but
at
a
considerable
height
from
the
ground
from
this
gallery
it
is
presumed
the
queen
lowered
her
son
with
the
scarfs
of
herself
and
her
female
attendants
during
the
darkness
of
the
night
to
the
hillside
where
some
of
his
faithful
adherents
waited
with
fleet
steeds
to
bear
him
to
the
mountains
between
three
and
four
hundred
years
have
elapsed
yet
this
scene
of
the
drama
remains
almost
unchanged
as
i
paced
the
gallery
my
imagination
pictured
the
anxious
queen
leaning
over
the
parapet
listening
with
the
throbbings
of
a
mother
s
heart
to
the
last
echoes
of
the
horses
hoofs
as
her
son
scoured
along
the
narrow
valley
of
the
darro
i
next
sought
the
gate
by
which
boabdil
made
his
last
exit
from
the
alhambra
when
about
to
surrender
his
capital
and
kingdom
with
the
melancholy
caprice
of
a
broken
spirit
or
perhaps
with
some
superstitious
feeling
he
requested
of
the
catholic
monarchs
that
no
one
afterwards
might
be
permitted
to
pass
through
it
his
prayer
according
to
ancient
chronicles
was
complied
with
through
the
sympathy
of
isabella
and
the
gate
was
walled
up
i
inquired
for
some
time
in
vain
for
such
a
portal
at
length
my
humble
attendant
mateo
ximenes
said
it
must
be
one
closed
up
with
stones
which
according
to
what
he
had
heard
from
his
father
and
grandfather
was
the
gateway
by
which
king
chico
had
left
the
fortress
there
was
a
mystery
about
it
and
it
had
never
been
opened
within
the
memory
of
the
oldest
inhabitant
he
conducted
me
to
the
spot
the
gateway
is
in
the
centre
of
what
was
once
an
immense
pile
called
the
tower
of
the
seven
floors
torre
de
los
siete
it
is
famous
in
the
neighborhood
as
the
scene
of
strange
apparitions
and
moorish
enchantments
according
to
swinburne
the
traveller
it
was
originally
the
great
gate
of
entrance
the
antiquaries
of
granada
pronounce
it
the
entrance
to
that
quarter
of
the
royal
residence
where
the
king
s
were
stationed
it
therefore
might
well
form
an
immediate
entrance
and
exit
to
the
palace
while
the
grand
gate
of
justice
served
as
the
entrance
of
state
to
the
fortress
when
boabdil
sallied
by
this
gate
to
descend
to
the
vega
where
he
was
to
surrender
the
keys
of
the
city
to
the
spanish
sovereigns
he
left
his
vizier
aben
comixa
to
receive
at
the
gate
of
justice
the
detachment
from
the
christian
army
and
the
officers
to
whom
the
fortress
was
to
be
given
up
the
once
redoubtable
tower
of
the
seven
floors
is
now
a
mere
wreck
having
been
blown
up
with
gunpowder
by
the
french
when
they
abandoned
the
fortress
great
masses
of
the
wall
lie
scattered
about
buried
in
luxuriant
herbage
or
overshadowed
by
vines
and
the
arch
of
the
gateway
though
rent
by
the
shock
still
remains
but
the
last
wish
of
poor
boabdil
has
again
though
unintentionally
been
fulfilled
for
the
portal
has
been
closed
up
by
loose
stones
gathered
from
the
ruins
and
remains
impassable
mounting
my
horse
i
followed
up
the
route
of
the
moslem
monarch
from
this
place
of
his
exit
crossing
the
hill
of
los
martyros
and
keeping
along
the
of
a
convent
bearing
the
same
name
i
descended
a
rugged
ravine
beset
by
thickets
of
aloes
and
indian
figs
and
lined
with
caves
and
hovels
swarming
with
gypsies
the
descent
was
so
steep
and
broken
that
i
was
fain
to
alight
and
lead
my
horse
by
this
poor
boabdil
took
his
sad
departure
to
avoid
passing
through
the
city
partly
perhaps
through
unwillingness
that
its
inhabitants
should
behold
his
humiliation
but
chiefly
in
all
probability
lest
it
might
cause
some
popular
agitation
for
the
last
reason
undoubtedly
the
detachment
sent
to
take
possession
of
the
fortress
ascended
by
the
same
route
emerging
from
this
rough
ravine
so
full
of
melancholy
associations
and
passing
by
the
de
los
the
gate
of
the
mills
i
issued
forth
upon
the
public
promenade
called
the
prado
and
pursuing
the
course
of
the
xenil
arrived
at
a
small
chapel
once
a
mosque
now
the
hermitage
of
san
sebastian
here
according
to
tradition
boabdil
surrendered
the
keys
of
granada
to
king
ferdinand
i
rode
slowly
thence
across
the
vega
to
a
village
where
the
family
and
household
of
the
unhappy
king
awaited
him
for
he
had
sent
them
forward
on
the
preceding
night
from
the
alhambra
that
his
mother
and
wife
might
not
participate
in
his
personal
humiliation
or
be
exposed
to
the
gaze
of
the
conquerors
following
on
in
the
route
of
the
melancholy
band
of
royal
exiles
i
arrived
at
the
foot
of
a
chain
of
barren
and
dreary
heights
forming
the
skirt
of
the
alpuxarra
mountains
from
the
summit
of
one
of
these
the
unfortunate
boabdil
took
his
last
look
at
granada
it
bears
a
name
expressive
of
his
sorrows
cuesta
de
las
the
hill
of
tears
beyond
it
a
sandy
road
winds
across
a
rugged
cheerless
waste
doubly
dismal
to
the
unhappy
monarch
as
it
led
to
exile
i
spurred
my
horse
to
the
summit
of
a
rock
where
boabdil
uttered
his
last
sorrowful
exclamation
as
he
turned
his
eyes
from
taking
their
farewell
gaze
it
is
still
denominated
ultimo
suspiro
del
the
last
sigh
of
the
moor
who
can
wonder
at
his
anguish
at
being
expelled
from
such
a
kingdom
and
such
an
abode
with
the
alhambra
he
seemed
to
be
yielding
up
all
the
honors
of
his
line
and
all
the
glories
and
delights
of
life
it
was
here
too
that
his
affliction
was
embittered
by
the
reproach
of
his
mother
ayxa
who
had
so
often
assisted
him
in
times
of
peril
and
had
vainly
sought
to
instil
into
him
her
own
resolute
spirit
you
do
well
said
she
to
weep
as
a
woman
over
what
you
could
not
defend
as
a
man
a
speech
savoring
more
of
the
pride
of
the
princess
than
the
tenderness
of
the
mother
when
this
anecdote
was
related
to
charles
by
bishop
guevara
the
emperor
joined
in
the
expression
of
scorn
at
the
weakness
of
the
wavering
boabdil
had
i
been
he
or
he
been
i
said
the
haughty
potentate
i
would
rather
have
made
this
alhambra
my
sepulchre
than
have
lived
without
a
kingdom
in
the
how
easy
it
is
for
those
in
power
and
prosperity
to
preach
heroism
to
the
vanquished
how
little
can
they
understand
that
life
itself
may
rise
in
value
with
the
unfortunate
when
naught
but
life
remains
slowly
descending
the
hill
of
tears
i
let
my
horse
take
his
own
loitering
gait
back
to
granada
while
i
turned
the
story
of
the
unfortunate
boabdil
over
in
my
mind
in
summing
up
the
particulars
i
found
the
balance
inclining
in
his
favor
throughout
the
whole
of
his
brief
turbulent
and
disastrous
reign
he
gives
evidence
of
a
mild
and
amiable
character
he
in
the
first
instance
won
the
hearts
of
his
people
by
his
affable
and
gracious
manners
he
was
always
placable
and
never
inflicted
any
severity
of
punishment
upon
those
who
occasionally
rebelled
against
him
he
was
personally
brave
but
wanted
moral
courage
and
in
times
of
difficulty
and
perplexity
was
wavering
and
irresolute
this
feebleness
of
spirit
hastened
his
downfall
while
it
deprived
him
of
that
heroic
grace
which
would
have
given
grandeur
and
dignity
to
his
fate
and
rendered
him
worthy
of
closing
the
splendid
drama
of
the
moslem
domination
in
spain
public
fêtes
of
granada
my
devoted
squire
and
whilom
ragged
cicerone
mateo
ximenes
had
a
passion
for
fêtes
and
holidays
and
was
never
so
eloquent
as
when
detailing
the
civil
and
religious
festivals
at
granada
during
the
preparations
for
the
annual
catholic
fête
of
corpus
christi
he
was
in
a
state
of
incessant
transition
between
the
alhambra
and
the
subjacent
city
bringing
me
daily
accounts
of
the
magnificent
arrangements
that
were
in
progress
and
endeavoring
but
in
vain
to
lure
me
down
from
my
cool
and
airy
retreat
to
witness
them
at
length
on
the
eve
of
the
eventful
day
i
yielded
to
his
solicitations
and
descended
from
the
regal
halls
of
the
alhambra
under
his
escort
as
did
of
yore
the
haroun
alraschid
under
that
of
his
grand
vizier
giaffar
though
it
was
yet
scarce
sunset
the
city
gates
were
already
thronged
with
the
picturesque
villagers
of
the
mountains
and
the
brown
peasantry
of
the
vega
granada
has
ever
been
the
of
a
great
mountainous
region
studded
with
towns
and
villages
hither
during
the
moorish
domination
the
chivalry
of
this
region
repaired
to
join
in
the
splendid
and
fêtes
of
the
vivarrambla
and
hither
the
élite
of
its
population
still
resort
to
join
in
the
pompous
ceremonials
of
the
church
indeed
many
of
the
mountaineers
from
the
alpuxarras
and
the
sierra
de
ronda
who
now
bow
to
the
cross
as
zealous
catholics
bear
the
stamp
of
their
moorish
origin
and
are
indubitable
descendants
of
the
fickle
subjects
of
boabdil
under
the
guidance
of
mateo
i
made
my
way
through
streets
already
teeming
with
a
holiday
population
to
the
square
of
the
vivarrambla
that
great
place
for
tilts
and
tourneys
so
often
sung
in
the
moorish
ballads
of
love
and
chivalry
a
gallery
or
arcade
of
wood
had
been
erected
along
the
sides
of
the
square
for
the
grand
religious
procession
of
the
following
day
this
was
brilliantly
illuminated
for
the
evening
as
a
promenade
and
bands
of
music
were
stationed
on
balconies
on
each
of
the
four
façades
of
the
square
all
the
fashion
and
beauty
of
granada
all
of
its
population
of
either
sex
that
had
good
looks
or
fine
clothes
to
display
thronged
this
arcade
promenading
round
and
round
the
vivarrambla
here
too
were
the
and
the
rural
beaux
and
belles
with
fine
forms
flashing
eyes
and
gay
andalusian
costumes
some
of
them
from
ronda
itself
that
stronghold
of
the
mountains
famous
for
contrabandistas
bullfighters
and
beautiful
women
while
this
gay
but
motley
throng
kept
up
a
constant
circulation
in
the
gallery
the
centre
of
the
square
was
occupied
by
the
peasantry
from
the
surrounding
country
who
made
no
pretensions
to
display
but
came
for
simple
hearty
enjoyment
the
whole
square
was
covered
with
them
forming
separate
groups
of
families
and
neighborhoods
like
gypsy
encampments
some
were
listening
to
the
traditional
ballad
drawled
out
to
the
tinkling
of
the
guitar
some
were
engaged
in
gay
conversation
some
were
dancing
to
the
click
of
the
castanet
as
i
threaded
my
way
through
this
teeming
region
with
mateo
at
my
heels
i
passed
occasionally
some
rustic
party
seated
on
the
ground
making
a
merry
though
frugal
repast
if
they
caught
my
eye
as
i
loitered
by
they
almost
invariably
invited
me
to
partake
of
their
simple
fare
this
hospitable
usage
inherited
from
their
moslem
invaders
and
originating
in
the
tent
of
the
arab
is
universal
throughout
the
land
and
observed
by
the
poorest
spaniard
as
the
night
advanced
the
gayety
gradually
died
away
in
the
arcades
the
bands
of
music
ceased
to
play
and
the
brilliant
crowd
dispersed
to
their
homes
the
centre
of
the
square
still
remained
well
peopled
and
mateo
assured
me
that
the
greater
part
of
the
peasantry
men
women
and
children
would
pass
the
night
there
sleeping
on
the
bare
earth
beneath
the
open
canopy
of
heaven
indeed
a
summer
night
requires
no
shelter
in
this
favored
climate
and
a
bed
is
a
superfluity
which
many
of
the
hardy
peasantry
of
spain
never
enjoy
and
which
some
of
them
affect
to
despise
the
common
spaniard
wraps
himself
in
his
brown
cloak
stretches
himself
on
his
manta
or
and
sleeps
soundly
luxuriously
accommodated
if
he
can
have
a
saddle
for
a
pillow
in
a
little
while
the
words
of
mateo
were
made
good
the
peasant
multitude
nestled
down
on
the
ground
to
their
night
s
repose
and
by
midnight
the
scene
on
the
vivarrambla
resembled
the
bivouac
of
an
army
the
next
morning
accompanied
by
mateo
i
revisited
the
square
at
sunrise
it
was
still
strewed
with
groups
of
sleepers
some
were
reposing
from
the
dance
and
revel
of
the
evening
others
who
had
left
their
villages
after
work
on
the
preceding
day
having
trudged
on
foot
the
greater
part
of
the
night
were
taking
a
sound
sleep
to
freshen
themselves
for
the
festivities
of
the
day
numbers
from
the
mountains
and
the
remote
villages
of
the
plain
who
had
set
out
in
the
night
continued
to
arrive
with
their
wives
and
children
all
were
in
high
spirits
greeting
each
other
and
exchanging
jokes
and
pleasantries
the
gay
tumult
thickened
as
the
day
advanced
now
came
pouring
in
at
the
city
gates
and
parading
through
the
streets
the
deputations
from
the
various
villages
destined
to
swell
the
grand
procession
these
village
deputations
were
headed
by
their
priests
bearing
their
respective
crosses
and
banners
and
images
of
the
blessed
virgin
and
of
patron
saints
all
which
were
matters
of
great
rivalship
and
jealousy
among
the
peasantry
it
was
like
the
chivalrous
gatherings
of
ancient
days
when
each
town
and
village
sent
its
chiefs
and
warriors
and
standards
to
defend
the
capital
or
grace
its
festivities
at
length
all
these
various
detachments
congregated
into
one
grand
pageant
which
slowly
paraded
round
the
vivarrambla
and
through
the
principal
streets
where
every
window
and
balcony
was
hung
with
tapestry
in
this
procession
were
all
the
religious
orders
the
civil
and
military
authorities
and
the
chief
people
of
the
parishes
and
villages
every
church
and
convent
had
contributed
its
banners
its
images
its
relics
and
poured
forth
its
wealth
for
the
occasion
in
the
centre
of
the
procession
walked
the
archbishop
under
a
damask
canopy
and
surrounded
by
inferior
dignitaries
and
their
dependants
the
whole
moved
to
the
swell
and
cadence
of
numerous
bands
of
music
and
passing
through
the
midst
of
a
countless
yet
silent
multitude
proceeded
onward
to
the
cathedral
i
could
not
but
be
struck
with
the
changes
of
times
and
customs
as
i
saw
this
monkish
pageant
passing
through
the
vivarrambla
the
ancient
seat
of
moslem
pomp
and
chivalry
the
contrast
was
indeed
forced
upon
the
mind
by
the
decorations
of
the
square
the
whole
front
of
the
wooden
gallery
erected
for
the
procession
extending
several
hundred
feet
was
faced
with
canvas
on
which
some
humble
though
patriotic
artist
had
painted
by
contract
a
series
of
the
principal
scenes
and
exploits
of
the
conquest
as
recorded
in
chronicle
and
romance
it
is
thus
the
romantic
legends
of
granada
mingle
themselves
with
everything
and
are
kept
fresh
in
the
public
mind
as
we
wended
our
way
back
to
the
alhambra
mateo
was
in
high
glee
and
garrulous
vein
ah
señor
exclaimed
he
there
is
no
place
in
all
the
world
like
granada
for
grand
ceremonies
a
man
need
spend
nothing
on
pleasure
here
it
is
all
furnished

the
peasantry

principal
mosque
a
token
of
having
consecrated
it
to
the
virgin
and
effected
his
retreat
in
safety
while
the
moorish
cavaliers
admired
this
daring
exploit
they
felt
bound
to
resent
it
on
the
following
day
therefore
tarfé
one
of
the
stoutest
among
them
paraded
in
front
of
the
christian
army
dragging
the
tablet
bearing
the
sacred
inscription
ave
maria
at
his
horse
s
tail
the
cause
of
the
virgin
was
eagerly
vindicated
by
garcilaso
de
la
vega
who
slew
the
moor
in
single
combat
and
elevated
the
tablet
in
devotion
and
triumph
at
the
end
of
his
lance
the
drama
founded
on
this
exploit
is
prodigiously
popular
with
the
common
people
although
it
has
been
acted
time
out
of
mind
it
never
fails
to
draw
crowds
who
become
completely
lost
in
the
delusions
of
the
scene
when
their
favorite
pulgar
strides
about
with
many
a
mouthy
speech
in
the
very
midst
of
the
moorish
capital
he
is
cheered
with
enthusiastic
bravos
and
when
he
nails
the
tablet
to
the
door
of
the
mosque
the
theatre
absolutely
shakes
with
the
thunders
of
applause
on
the
other
hand
the
unlucky
actors
who
figure
in
the
part
of
the
moors
have
to
bear
the
brunt
of
popular
indignation
which
at
times
equals
that
of
the
hero
of
lamanche
at
the
of
gines
de
passamonte
for
when
the
infidel
tarfé
plucks
down
the
tablet
to
tie
it
to
his
horse
s
tail
some
of
the
audience
rise
in
fury
and
are
ready
to
jump
upon
the
stage
to
revenge
this
insult
to
the
virgin
by
the
way
the
actual
lineal
descendant
of
hernando
del
pulgar
was
the
marquis
de
salar
as
the
legitimate
representative
of
that
madcap
hero
and
in
commemoration
and
reward
of
this
hero
s
exploit
above
mentioned
he
inherited
the
right
to
enter
the
cathedral
on
certain
occasions
on
horseback
to
sit
within
the
choir
and
to
put
on
his
hat
at
the
elevation
of
the
host
though
these
privileges
were
often
and
obstinately
contested
by
the
clergy
i
met
him
occasionally
in
society
he
was
young
of
agreeable
appearance
and
manners
with
bright
black
eyes
in
which
appeared
to
lurk
some
of
the
fire
of
his
ancestors
among
the
paintings
in
the
vivarrambla
on
the
fête
of
corpus
christi
were
some
depicting
in
vivid
style
the
exploits
of
the
family
hero
an
old
servant
of
the
pulgars
shed
tears
on
beholding
them
and
hurried
home
to
inform
the
marquis
the
eager
zeal
and
enthusiasm
of
the
old
domestic
only
provoked
a
light
laugh
from
his
young
master
whereupon
turning
to
the
brother
of
the
marquis
with
that
freedom
allowed
in
spain
to
old
family
servants
come
señor
cried
he
you
are
more
considerate
than
your
brother
come
and
see
your
ancestor
in
all
his
glory
in
emulation
of
this
great
de
la
of
granada
almost
every
village
and
petty
town
of
the
mountains
has
its
own
anniversary
commemorating
with
rustic
pomp
and
uncouth
ceremonial
its
deliverance
from
the
moorish
yoke
on
these
occasions
according
to
mateo
a
kind
of
resurrection
takes
place
of
ancient
armor
and
weapons
great
swords
ponderous
arquebuses
with
matchlocks
and
other
warlike
relics
treasured
up
from
generation
to
generation
since
the
time
of
the
conquest
and
happy
the
community
that
possesses
some
old
piece
of
ordnance
peradventure
one
of
the
identical
lombards
used
by
the
conquerors
it
is
kept
thundering
along
the
mountains
all
day
long
provided
the
community
can
afford
sufficient
expenditure
of
powder
in
the
course
of
the
day
a
kind
of
warlike
drama
is
enacted
some
of
the
populace
parade
the
streets
fitted
out
with
the
old
armor
as
champions
of
the
faith
others
appear
dressed
up
as
moorish
warriors
a
tent
is
pitched
in
the
public
square
inclosing
an

with
an
image
of
the
virgin
the
christian
warriors
approach
to
perform
their
devotions
the
infidels
surround
the
tent
to
prevent
their
entrance
a
mock
fight
ensues
the
combatants
sometimes
forget
that
they
are
merely
playing
a
part
and
dry
blows
of
grievous
weight
are
apt
to
be
exchanged
the
contest
however
invariably
terminates
in
favor
of
the
good
cause
the
moors
are
defeated
and
taken
prisoners
the
image
of
the
virgin
rescued
from
thraldom
is
elevated
in
triumph
a
grand
procession
succeeds
in
which
the

figure
with
great
applause
and
vainglory
while
their
captives
are
led
in
chains
to
the
evident
delight
and
edification
of
the
spectators
these
celebrations
are
heavy
drains
on
the
treasuries
of
these
petty
communities
and
have
sometimes
to
be
suspended
for
want
of
funds
but
when
times
grow
better
or
sufficient
money
has
been
hoarded
for
the
purpose
they
are
resumed
with
new
zeal
and
prodigality

local
traditions
the
common
people
of

have
an
oriental
passion

and
are
fond
of
the

they
will
gather
round
the
doors
of
their

in

in

of

with

to

perilous

of

and
daring
exploits
of

and

the
wild
and
solitary
character
of
the
country
the
imperfect
diffusion
of
knowledge
the
scarceness
of
general
topics
of
conversation
and
the
romantic
adventurous
life
that
every
one
leads
in
a
land
where
travelling
is
yet
in
its
primitive
state
all
contribute
to
cherish
this
love
of
oral
narration
and
to
produce
a
strong
infusion
of
the
extravagant
and
incredible
there
is
no
theme
however
more
prevalent
and
popular
than
that
of
treasures
buried
by
the
moors
it
pervades
the
whole
country
in
traversing
the
wild
sierras
the
scenes
of
ancient
foray
and
exploit
you
can
not
see
a
moorish
atalaya
or
perched
among
the
cliffs
or
beetling
above
its
village
but
your
muleteer
on
being
closely
questioned
will
suspend
the
smoking
of
his
cigarillo
to
tell
some
tale
of
moslem
gold
buried
beneath
its
foundations
nor
is
there
a
ruined
alcazar
in
a
city
but
has
its
golden
tradition
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
among
the
poor
people
of
the
neighborhood
these
like
most
popular
fictions
have
sprung
from
some
scanty
groundwork
of
fact
during
the
wars
between
moor
and
christian
which
distracted
this
country
for
centuries
towns
and
castles
were
liable
frequently
and
suddenly
to
change
owners
and
the
inhabitants
during
sieges
and
assaults
were
fain
to
bury
their
money
and
jewels
in
the
earth
or
hide
them
in
vaults
and
wells
as
is
often
done
at
the
present
day
in
the
despotic
and
belligerent
countries
of
the
east
at
the
time
of
the
expulsion
of
the
moors
also
many
of
them
concealed
their
most
precious
effects
hoping
that
their
exile
would
be
but
temporary
and
that
they
would
be
enabled
to
return
and
retrieve
their
treasures
at
some
future
day
it
is
certain
that
from
time
to
time
hoards
of
gold
and
silver
coin
have
been
accidentally
digged
up
after
a
lapse
of
centuries
from
among
the
ruins
of
moorish
fortresses
and
habitations
and
it
requires
but
a
few
facts
of
the
kind
to
give
birth
to
a
thousand
fictions
the
stories
thus
originating
have
generally
something
of
an
oriental
tinge
and
are
marked
with
that
mixture
of
the
arabic
and
the
gothic
which
seems
to
me
to
characterize
everything
in
spain
and
especially
in
its
southern
provinces
the
hidden
wealth
is
always
laid
under
magic
spell
and
secured
by
charm
and
talisman
sometimes
it
is
guarded
by
uncouth
monsters
or
fiery
dragons
sometimes
by
enchanted
moors
who
sit
by
it
in
armor
with
drawn
swords
but
motionless
as
statues
maintaining
a
sleepless
watch
for
ages
the
alhambra
of
course
from
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
its
history
is
a
stronghold
for
popular
fictions
of
the
kind
and
various
relics
digged
up
from
time
to
time
have
contributed
to
strengthen
them
at
one
time
an
earthen
vessel
was
found
containing
moorish
coins
and
the
skeleton
of
a
cock
which
according
to
the
opinion
of
certain
shrewd
inspectors
must
have
been
buried
alive
at
another
time
a
vessel
was
dug
up
containing
a
great
scarabæus
or
beetle
of
baked
clay
covered
with
arabic
inscriptions
which
was
pronounced
a
prodigious
amulet
of
occult
virtues
in
this
way
the
wits
of
the
ragged
brood
who
inhabit
the
alhambra
have
been
set
until
there
is
not
a
hall
nor
tower
nor
vault
of
the
old
fortress
that
has
not
been
made
the
scene
of
some
marvellous
tradition
having
i
trust
in
the
preceding
papers
made
the
reader
in
some
degree
familiar
with
the
localities
of
the
alhambra
i
shall
now
launch
out
more
largely
into
the
wonderful
legends
connected
with
it
and
which
i
have
diligently
wrought
into
shape
and
form
from
various
legendary
scraps
and
hints
picked
up
in
the
course
of
my
perambulations
in
the
same
manner
that
an
antiquary
works
out
a
regular
historical
document
from
a
few
scattered
letters
of
an
almost
defaced
inscription
if
anything
in
these
legends
should
shock
the
faith
of
the
reader
he
must
remember
the
nature
of
the
place
and
make
due
allowances
he
must
not
expect
here
the
same
laws
of
probability
that
govern
commonplace
scenes
and
life
he
must
remember
that
he
treads
the
halls
of
an
enchanted
palace
and
that
all
is
haunted
the
house
of
the
weathercock
on
the
brow
of
the
lofty
hill
of
the
albaycin
the
highest
part
of
granada
and
which
rises
from
the
narrow
valley
of
the
darro
directly
opposite
to
the
alhambra
stands
all
that
is
left
of
what
was
once
a
royal
palace
of
the
moors
it
has
in
fact
fallen
into
such
obscurity
that
it
cost
me
much
trouble
to
find
it
though
aided
in
my
researches
by
the
sagacious
and
mateo
ximenes
this
edifice
has
borne
for
centuries
the
name
of
the
house
of
the
weathercock
la
casa
del
gallo
de
viento
from
a
bronze
figure
on
one
of
its
turrets
in
ancient
times
of
a
warrior
on
horseback
and
turning
with
every
breeze
this
weathercock
was
considered
by
the
moslems
of
granada
a
portentous
talisman
according
to
some
traditions
it
bore
the
following
arabic
inscription
calet
el
bedici
aben
habuz
quidat
ehahet
lindabuz
which
has
been
rendered
into
spanish

and
into
english
in
this
way
says
aben
habuz
the
wise
andaluz
guards
against
surprise
this
aben
habuz
according
to
some
of
the
old
moorish
chronicles
was
a
captain
in
the
invading
army
of
taric
one
of
the
conquerors
of
spain
who
left
him
as
alcayde
of
granada
he
is
supposed
to
have
intended
this
effigy
as
a
perpetual
warning
to
the
moslems
of
andaluz
that
surrounded
by
foes
their
safety
depended
upon
their
being
always
on
their
guard
and
ready
for
the
field
others
among
whom
is
the
christian
historian
marmol
affirms
badis
aben
habus
to
have
been
a
moorish
sultan
of
granada
and
that
the
weathercock
was
intended
as
a
perpetual
admonition
of
the
instability
of
moslem
power
bearing
the
following
words
in
arabic
thus
ibn
habus
al
badise
predicts
andalus
shall
one
day
vanish
and
pass
another
version
of
this
portentous
inscription
is
given
by
a
moslem
historian
on
the
authority
of
sidi
hasan
a
faquir
who
flourished
about
the
time
of
ferdinand
and
isabella
and
who
was
present
at
the
taking
down
of
the
weathercock
when
the
old
kassaba
was
undergoing
repairs
i
saw
it
says
the
venerable
faquir
with
my
own
eyes
it
was
of
a
heptagonal
shape
and
had
the
following
inscription
in
verse
the
palace
at
fair
granada
presents
a
the
horseman
though
a
solid
body
turns
with
every
this
to
a
wise
man
reveals
a
mystery
in
a
little
while
comes
a
calamity
to
ruin
both
the
palace
and
its
in
effect
it
was
not
long
after
this
meddling
with
the
portentous
weathercock
that
the
following
event
occurred
as
old
muley
abul
hassan
the
king
of
granada
was
seated
under
a
sumptuous
pavilion
reviewing
his
troops
who
paraded
before
him
in
armor
of
polished
steel
and
gorgeous
silken
robes
mounted
on
fleet
steeds
and
equipped
with
swords
spears
and
shields
embossed
with
gold
and
silver
suddenly
a
tempest
was
seen
hurrying
from
the
southwest
in
a
little
while
black
clouds
overshadowed
the
heavens
and
burst
forth
with
a
deluge
of
rain
torrents
came
roaring
down
from
the
mountains
bringing
with
them
rocks
and
trees
the
darro
overflowed
its
banks
mills
were
swept
away
bridges
destroyed
gardens
laid
waste
the
inundation
rushed
into
the
city
undermining
houses
drowning
their
inhabitants
and
overflowing
even
the
square
of
the
great
mosque
the
people
rushed
in
affright
to
the
mosques
to
implore
the
mercy
of
allah
regarding
this
uproar
of
the
elements
as
the
harbinger
of
dreadful
calamities
and
indeed
according
to
the
arabian
historian
al
makkari
it
was
but
a
type
and
prelude
of
the
direful
war
which
ended
in
the
downfall
of
the
moslem
kingdom
of
granada
i
have
thus
given
historic
authorities
sufficient
to
show
the
portentous
mysteries
connected
with
the
house
of
the
weathercock
and
its
talismanic
horseman
i
now
proceed
to
relate
still
more
surprising
things
about
aben
habuz
and
his
palace
for
the
truth
of
which
should
any
doubt
be
entertained
i
refer
the
dubious
reader
to
mateo
ximenes
and
his
of
the
alhambra
legend
of
the
arabian
astrologer
in
old
times
many
hundred
years
ago
there
was
a
moorish
king
named
aben
habuz
who
reigned
over
the
kingdom
of
granada
he
was
a
retired
conqueror
that
is
to
say
one
who
having
in
his
more
youthful
days
led
a
life
of
constant
foray
and
depredation
now
that
he
was
grown
feeble
and
superannuated
languished
for
repose
and
desired
nothing
more
than
to
live
at
peace
with
all
the
world
to
husband
his
laurels
and
to
enjoy
in
quiet
the
possessions
he
had
wrested
from
his
neighbors
it
so
happened
however
that
this
most
reasonable
and
pacific
old
monarch
had
young
rivals
to
deal
with
princes
full
of
his
early
passion
for
fame
and
fighting
and
who
were
disposed
to
call
him
to
account
for
the
scores
he
had
run
up
with
their
fathers
certain
distant
districts
of
his
own
territories
also
which
during
the
days
of
his
vigor
he
had
treated
with
a
high
hand
were
prone
now
that
he
languished
for
repose
to
rise
in
rebellion
and
threaten
to
invest
him
in
his
capital
thus
he
had
foes
on
every
side
and
as
granada
is
surrounded
by
wild
and
craggy
mountains
which
hide
the
approach
of
an
enemy
the
unfortunate
aben
habuz
was
kept
in
a
constant
state
of
vigilance
and
alarm
not
knowing
in
what
quarter
hostilities
might
break
out
it
was
in
vain
that
he
built
on
the
mountains
and
stationed
guards
at
every
pass
with
orders
to
make
fires
by
night
and
smoke
by
day
on
the
approach
of
an
enemy
his
alert
foes
baffling
every
precaution
would
break
out
of
some
defile
ravage
his
lands
beneath
his
very
nose
and
then
make
off
with
prisoners
and
booty
to
the
mountains
was
ever
peaceable
and
retired
conqueror
in
a
more
uncomfortable
predicament
while
aben
habuz
was
harassed
by
these
perplexities
and
molestations
an
ancient
arabian
physician
arrived
at
his
court
his
gray
beard
descended
to
his
girdle
and
he
had
every
mark
of
extreme
age
yet
he
had
travelled
almost
the
whole
way
from
egypt
on
foot
with
no
other
aid
than
a
staff
marked
with
hieroglyphics
his
fame
had
preceded
him
his
name
was
ibrahim
ebn
abu
ayub
he
was
said
to
have
lived
ever
since
the
days
of
mahomet
and
to
be
son
of
abu
ayub
the
last
of
the
companions
of
the
prophet
he
had
when
a
child
followed
the
conquering
army
of
amru
into
egypt
where
he
had
remained
many
years
studying
the
dark
sciences
and
particularly
magic
among
the
egyptian
priests
it
was
moreover
said
that
he
had
found
out
the
secret
of
prolonging
life
by
means
of
which
he
had
arrived
to
the
great
age
of
upwards
of
two
centuries
though
as
he
did
not
discover
the
secret
until
well
stricken
in
years
he
could
only
perpetuate
his
gray
hairs
and
wrinkles
this
wonderful
old
man
was
honorably
entertained
by
the
king
who
like
most
superannuated
monarchs
began
to
take
physicians
into
great
favor
he
would
have
assigned
him
an
apartment
in
his
palace
but
the
astrologer
preferred
a
cave
in
the
side
of
the
hill
which
rises
above
the
city
of
granada
being
the
same
on
which
the
alhambra
has
since
been
built
he
caused
the
cave
to
be
enlarged
so
as
to
form
a
spacious
and
lofty
hall
with
a
circular
hole
at
the
top
through
which
as
through
a
well
he
could
see
the
heavens
and
behold
the
stars
even
at
the
walls
of
this
hall
were
covered
with
egyptian
hieroglyphics
with
cabalistic
symbols
and
with
the
figures
of
the
stars
in
their
signs
this
hall
he
furnished
with
many
implements
fabricated
under
his
directions
by
cunning
artificers
of
granada
but
the
occult
properties
of
which
were
known
only
to
himself
in
a
little
while
the
sage
ibrahim
became
the
bosom
counsellor
of
the
king
who
applied
to
him
for
advice
in
every
emergency
aben
habuz
was
once
inveighing
against
the
injustice
of
his
neighbors
and
bewailing
the
restless
vigilance
he
had
to
observe
to
guard
himself
against
their
invasions
when
he
had
finished
the
astrologer
remained
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
replied
know
o
king
that
when
i
was
in
egypt
i
beheld
a
great
marvel
devised
by
a
pagan
priestess
of
old
on
a
mountain
above
the
city
of
borsa
and
overlooking
the
great
valley
of
the
nile
was
a
figure
of
a
ram
and
above
it
a
figure
of
a
cock
both
of
molten
brass
and
turning
upon
a
pivot
whenever
the
country
was
threatened
with
invasion
the
ram
would
turn
in
the
direction
of
the
enemy
and
the
cock
would
crow
upon
this
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
knew
of
the
danger
and
of
the
quarter
from
which
it
was
approaching
and
could
take
timely
means
to
guard
against
god
is
great
exclaimed
the
pacific
aben
habuz
what
a
treasure
would
be
such
a
ram
to
keep
an
eye
upon
these
mountains
around
me
and
then
such
a
cock
to
crow
in
time
of
danger
allah
akbar
how
securely
i
might
sleep
in
my
palace
with
such
sentinels
on
the
top
the
astrologer
waited
until
the
ecstasies
of
the
king
had
subsided
and
then
proceeded
after
the
victorious
amru
may
he
rest
in
peace
had
finished
his
conquest
of
egypt
i
remained
among
the
priests
of
the
land
studying
the
rites
and
ceremonies
of
their
idolatrous
faith
and
seeking
to
make
myself
master
of
the
hidden
knowledge
for
which
they
are
renowned
i
was
one
day
seated
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
conversing
with
an
ancient
priest
when
he
pointed
to
the
mighty
pyramids
which
rose
like
mountains
out
of
the
neighboring
desert
all
that
we
can
teach
thee
said
he
is
nothing
to
the
knowledge
locked
up
in
those
mighty
piles
in
the
centre
of
the
central
pyramid
is
a
sepulchral
chamber
in
which
is
enclosed
the
mummy
of
the
who
aided
in
rearing
that
stupendous
pile
and
with
him
is
buried
a
wondrous
book
of
knowledge
containing
all
the
secrets
of
magic
and
art
this
book
was
given
to
adam
after
his
fall
and
was
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
to
king
solomon
the
wise
and
by
its
aid
he
built
the
temple
of
jerusalem
how
it
came
into
the
possession
of
the
builder
of
the
pyramids
is
known
to
him
alone
who
knows
all
when
i
heard
these
words
of
the
egyptian
priest
my
heart
burned
to
get
possession
of
that
book
i
could
command
the
services
of
many
of
the
soldiers
of
our
conquering
army
and
of
a
number
of
the
native
egyptians
with
these
i
set
to
work
and
pierced
the
solid
mass
of
the
pyramid
until
after
great
toil
i
came
upon
one
of
its
interior
and
hidden
passages
following
this
up
and
threading
a
fearful
labyrinth
i
penetrated
into
the
very
heart
of
the
pyramids
even
to
the
sepulchral
chamber
where
the
mummy
of
the
had
lain
for
ages
i
broke
through
the
outer
cases
of
the
mummy
unfolded
its
many
wrappers
and
bandages
and
at
length
found
the
precious
volume
on
its
bosom
i
seized
it
with
a
trembling
hand
and
groped
my
way
out
of
the
pyramid
leaving
the
mummy
in
its
dark
and
silent
sepulchre
there
to
await
the
final
day
of
resurrection
and
son
of
abu
ayub
exclaimed
aben
habuz
thou
hast
been
a
great
traveller
and
seen
marvellous
things
but
of
what
avail
to
me
is
the
secret
of
the
pyramid
and
the
volume
of
knowledge
of
the
wise
solomon
this
it
is
o
king
by
the
study
of
that
book
i
am
instructed
in
all
magic
arts
and
can
command
the
assistance
of
genii
to
accomplish
my
plans
the
mystery
of
the
talisman
of
borsa
is
therefore
familiar
to
me
and
such
a
talisman
can
i
make
nay
one
of
greater
o
wise
son
of
abu
ayub
cried
aben
habuz
better
were
such
a
talisman
than
all
the
on
the
hills
and
sentinels
upon
the
borders
give
me
such
a
safeguard
and
the
riches
of
my
treasury
are
at
thy
the
astrologer
immediately
set
to
work
to
gratify
the
wishes
of
the
monarch
he
caused
a
great
tower
to
be
erected
upon
the
top
of
the
royal
palace
which
stood
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
of
the
albaycin
the
tower
was
built
of
stones
brought
from
egypt
and
taken
it
is
said
from
one
of
the
pyramids
in
the
upper
part
of
the
tower
was
a
circular
hall
with
windows
looking
towards
every
point
of
the
compass
and
before
each
window
was
a
table
on
which
was
arranged
as
on
a
a
mimic
army
of
horse
and
foot
with
the
effigy
of
the
potentate
that
ruled
in
that
direction
all
carved
of
wood
to
each
of
these
tables
there
was
a
small
lance
no
bigger
than
a
bodkin
on
which
were
engraved
certain
chaldaic
characters
this
hall
was
kept
constantly
closed
by
a
gate
of
brass
with
a
great
lock
of
steel
the
key
of
which
was
in
possession
of
the
king
on
the
top
of
the
tower
was
a
bronze
figure
of
a
moorish
horseman
fixed
on
a
pivot
with
a
shield
on
one
arm
and
his
lance
elevated
perpendicularly
the
face
of
this
horseman
was
towards
the
city
as
if
keeping
guard
over
it
but
if
any
foe
were
at
hand
the
figure
would
turn
in
that
direction
and
would
level
the
lance
as
if
for
action
when
this
talisman
was
finished
aben
habuz
was
all
impatient
to
try
its
virtues
and
longed
as
ardently
for
an
invasion
as
he
had
ever
sighed
after
repose
his
desire
was
soon
gratified
tidings
were
brought
early
one
morning
by
the
sentinel
appointed
to
watch
the
tower
that
the
face
of
the
bronze
horseman
was
turned
towards
the
mountains
of
elvira
and
that
his
lance
pointed
directly
against
the
pass
of
lope
let
the
drums
and
trumpets
sound
to
arms
and
all
granada
be
put
on
the
alert
said
aben
habuz
o
king
said
the
astrologer
let
not
your
city
be
disquieted
nor
your
warriors
called
to
arms
we
need
no
aid
of
force
to
deliver
you
from
your
enemies
dismiss
your
attendants
and
let
us
proceed
alone
to
the
secret
hall
of
the
the
ancient
aben
habuz
mounted
the
staircase
of
the
tower
leaning
on
the
arm
of
the
still
more
ancient
ibrahim
ebn
abu
ayub
they
unlocked
the
brazen
door
and
entered
the
window
that
looked
towards
the
pass
of
lope
was
open
in
this
direction
said
the
astrologer
lies
the
danger
approach
o
king
and
behold
the
mystery
of
the
king
aben
habuz
approached
the
seeming
on
which
were
arranged
the
small
wooden
effigies
when
to
his
surprise
he
perceived
that
they
were
all
in
motion
the
horses
pranced
and
curveted
the
warriors
brandished
their
weapons
and
there
was
a
faint
sound
of
drums
and
trumpets
and
the
clang
of
arms
and
neighing
of
steeds
but
all
no
louder
nor
more
distinct
than
the
hum
of
the
bee
or
the
in
the
drowsy
ear
of
him
who
lies
at
noontide
in
the
shade
behold
o
king
said
the
astrologer
a
proof
that
thy
enemies
are
even
now
in
the
field
they
must
be
advancing
through
yonder
mountains
by
the
pass
of
lope
would
you
produce
a
panic
and
confusion
amongst
them
and
cause
them
to
retreat
without
loss
of
life
strike
these
effigies
with
the
of
this
magic
lance
would
you
cause
bloody
feud
and
carnage
strike
with
the
a
livid
streak
passed
across
the
countenance
of
aben
habuz
he
seized
the
lance
with
trembling
eagerness
his
gray
beard
wagged
with
exultation
as
he
tottered
toward
the
table
son
of
abu
ayub
exclaimed
he
in
chuckling
tone
i
think
we
will
have
a
little
blood
so
saying
he
thrust
the
magic
lance
into
some
of
the
pigmy
effigies
and
belabored
others
with
the
upon
which
the
former
fell
as
dead
upon
the
board
and
the
rest
turning
upon
each
other
began
a
fight
it
was
with
difficulty
the
astrologer
could
stay
the
hand
of
the
most
pacific
of
monarchs
and
prevent
him
from
absolutely
exterminating
his
foes
at
length
he
prevailed
upon
him
to
leave
the
tower
and
to
send
out
scouts
to
the
mountains
by
the
pass
of
lope
they
returned
with
the
intelligence
that
a
christian
army
had
advanced
through
the
heart
of
the
sierra
almost
within
sight
of
granada
where
a
dissension
had
broken
out
among
them
they
had
turned
their
weapons
against
each
other
and
after
much
slaughter
had
retreated
over
the
border
aben
habuz
was
transported
with
joy
on
thus
proving
the
efficacy
of
the
talisman
at
length
said
he
i
shall
lead
a
life
of
tranquillity
and
have
all
my
enemies
in
my
power
o
wise
son
of
abu
ayub
what
can
i
bestow
on
thee
in
reward
for
such
a
blessing
the
wants
of
an
old
man
and
a
philosopher
o
king
are
few
and
simple
grant
me
but
the
means
of
fitting
up
my
cave
as
a
suitable
hermitage
and
i
am
how
noble
is
the
moderation
of
the
truly
wise
exclaimed
aben
habuz
secretly
pleased
at
the
cheapness
of
the
recompense
he
summoned
his
treasurer
and
bade
him
dispense
whatever
sums
might
be
required
by
ibrahim
to
complete
and
furnish
his
hermitage
the
astrologer
now
gave
orders
to
have
various
chambers
hewn
out
of
the
solid
rock
so
as
to
form
ranges
of
apartments
connected
with
his
astrological
hall
these
he
caused
to
be
furnished
with
luxurious
ottomans
and
divans
and
the
walls
to
be
hung
with
the
richest
silks
of
damascus
i
am
an
old
man
said
he
and
can
no
longer
rest
my
bones
on
stone
couches
and
these
damp
walls
require
he
had
baths
too
constructed
and
provided
with
all
kinds
of
perfumes
and
aromatic
oils
for
a
bath
said
he
is
necessary
to
counteract
the
rigidity
of
age
and
to
restore
freshness
and
suppleness
to
the
frame
withered
by
he
caused
the
apartments
to
be
hung
with
innumerable
silver
and
crystal
lamps
which
he
filled
with
a
fragrant
oil
prepared
according
to
a
receipt
discovered
by
him
in
the
tombs
of
egypt
this
oil
was
perpetual
in
its
nature
and
diffused
a
soft
radiance
like
the
tempered
light
of
day
the
light
of
the
sun
said
he
is
too
garish
and
violent
for
the
eyes
of
an
old
man
and
the
light
of
the
lamp
is
more
congenial
to
the
studies
of
a
the
treasurer
of
king
aben
habuz
groaned
at
the
sums
daily
demanded
to
fit
up
this
hermitage
and
he
carried
his
complaints
to
the
king
the
royal
word
however
had
been
given
aben
habuz
shrugged
his
shoulders
we
must
have
patience
said
he
this
old
man
has
taken
his
idea
of
a
philosophic
retreat
from
the
interior
of
the
pyramids
and
of
the
vast
ruins
of
egypt
but
all
things
have
an
end
and
so
will
the
furnishing
of
his
the
king
was
in
the
right
the
hermitage
was
at
length
complete
and
formed
a
sumptuous
subterranean
palace
the
astrologer
expressed
himself
perfectly
content
and
shutting
himself
up
remained
for
three
whole
days
buried
in
study
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
appeared
again
before
the
treasurer
one
thing
more
is
necessary
said
he
one
trifling
solace
for
the
intervals
of
mental
o
wise
ibrahim
i
am
bound
to
furnish
everything
necessary
for
thy
solitude
what
more
dost
thou
require
i
would
fain
have
a
few
echoed
the
treasurer
with
surprise
replied
the
sage
gravely
and
let
them
be
young
and
fair
to
look
upon
for
the
sight
of
youth
and
beauty
is
refreshing
a
few
will
suffice
for
i
am
a
philosopher
of
simple
habits
and
easily
while
the
philosophic
ibrahim
ebn
abu
ayub
passed
his
time
thus
sagely
in
his
hermitage
the
pacific
aben
habuz
carried
on
furious
campaigns
in
effigy
in
his
tower
it
was
a
glorious
thing
for
an
old
man
like
himself
of
quiet
habits
to
have
war
made
easy
and
to
be
enabled
to
amuse
himself
in
his
chamber
by
brushing
away
whole
armies
like
so
many
swarms
of
flies
for
a
time
he
rioted
in
the
indulgence
of
his
humors
and
even
taunted
and
insulted
his
neighbors
to
induce
them
to
make
incursions
but
by
degrees
they
grew
wary
from
repeated
disasters
until
no
one
ventured
to
invade
his
territories
for
many
months
the
bronze
horseman
remained
on
the
peace
establishment
with
his
lance
elevated
in
the
air
and
the
worthy
old
monarch
began
to
repine
at
the
want
of
his
accustomed
sport
and
to
grow
peevish
at
his
monotonous
tranquillity
at
length
one
day
the
talismanic
horseman
veered
suddenly
round
and
lowering
his
lance
made
a
dead
point
towards
the
mountains
of
guadix
aben
habuz
hastened
to
his
tower
but
the
magic
table
in
that
direction
remained
quiet
not
a
single
warrior
was
in
motion
perplexed
at
the
circumstance
he
sent
forth
a
troop
of
horse
to
scour
the
mountains
and
reconnoitre
they
returned
after
three
days
absence
we
have
searched
every
mountain
pass
said
they
but
not
a
helm
nor
spear
was
stirring
all
that
we
have
found
in
the
course
of
our
foray
was
a
christian
damsel
of
surpassing
beauty
sleeping
at
noontide
beside
a
fountain
whom
we
have
brought
away
a
damsel
of
surpassing
beauty
exclaimed
aben
habuz
his
eyes
gleaming
with
animation
let
her
be
conducted
into
my
the
beautiful
damsel
was
accordingly
conducted
into
his
presence
she
was
arrayed
with
all
the
luxury
of
ornament
that
had
prevailed
among
the
gothic
spaniards
at
the
time
of
the
arabian
conquest
pearls
of
dazzling
whiteness
were
entwined
with
her
raven
tresses
and
jewels
sparkled
on
her
forehead
rivalling
the
lustre
of
her
eyes
around
her
neck
was
a
golden
chain
to
which
was
suspended
a
silver
lyre
which
hung
by
her
side
the
flashes
of
her
dark
refulgent
eye
were
like
sparks
of
fire
on
the
withered
yet
combustible
heart
of
aben
habuz
the
swimming
voluptuousness
of
her
gait
made
his
senses
reel
fairest
of
women
cried
he
with
rapture
who
and
what
art
thou
the
daughter
of
one
of
the
gothic
princes
who
but
lately
ruled
over
this
land
the
armies
of
my
father
have
been
destroyed
as
if
by
magic
among
these
mountains
he
has
been
driven
into
exile
and
his
daughter
is
a
beware
o
king
whispered
ibrahim
ebn
abu
ayub
this
may
be
one
of
those
northern
sorceresses
of
whom
we
have
heard
who
assume
the
most
seductive
forms
to
beguile
the
unwary
methinks
i
read
witchcraft
in
her
eye
and
sorcery
in
every
movement
doubtless
this
is
the
enemy
pointed
out
by
the
son
of
abu
ayub
replied
the
king
thou
art
a
wise
man
i
grant
a
conjuror
for
aught
i
know
but
thou
art
little
versed
in
the
ways
of
woman
in
that
knowledge
will
i
yield
to
no
man
no
not
to
the
wise
solomon
himself
notwithstanding
the
number
of
his
wives
and
concubines
as
to
this
damsel
i
see
no
harm
in
her
she
is
fair
to
look
upon
and
finds
favor
in
my
hearken
o
king
replied
the
astrologer
i
have
given
thee
many
victories
by
means
of
my
talisman
but
have
never
shared
any
of
the
spoil
give
me
then
this
stray
captive
to
solace
me
in
my
solitude
with
her
silver
lyre
if
she
be
indeed
a
sorceress
i
have
counter
spells
that
set
her
charms
at
what
more
women
cried
aben
habuz
hast
thou
not
already
enough
to
solace
thee
have
i
it
is
true
but
no
i
would
fain
have
a
little
minstrelsy
to
refresh
my
mind
when
weary
with
the
toils
of
a
truce
with
thy
hermit
cravings
said
the
king
impatiently
this
damsel
have
i
marked
for
my
own
i
see
much
comfort
in
her
even
such
comfort
as
david
the
father
of
solomon
the
wise
found
in
the
society
of
abishag
the
further
solicitations
and
remonstrances
of
the
astrologer
only
provoked
a
more
peremptory
reply
from
the
monarch
and
they
parted
in
high
displeasure
the
sage
shut
himself
up
in
his
hermitage
to
brood
over
his
disappointment
ere
he
departed
however
he
gave
the
king
one
more
warning
to
beware
of
his
dangerous
captive
but
where
is
the
old
man
in
love
that
will
listen
to
counsel
aben
habuz
resigned
himself
to
the
full
sway
of
his
passion
his
only
study
was
how
to
render
himself
amiable
in
the
eyes
of
the
gothic
beauty
he
had
not
youth
to
recommend
him
it
is
true
but
then
he
had
riches
and
when
a
lover
is
old
he
is
generally
generous
the
zacatin
of
granada
was
ransacked
for
the
most
precious
merchandise
of
the
east
silks
jewels
precious
gems
exquisite
perfumes
all
that
asia
and
africa
yielded
of
rich
and
rare
were
lavished
upon
the
princess
all
kinds
of
spectacles
and
festivities
were
devised
for
her
entertainment
minstrelsy
dancing
tournaments
granada
for
a
time
was
a
scene
of
perpetual
pageant
the
gothic
princess
regarded
all
this
splendor
with
the
air
of
one
accustomed
to
magnificence
she
received
everything
as
a
homage
due
to
her
rank
or
rather
to
her
beauty
for
beauty
is
more
lofty
in
its
exactions
even
than
rank
nay
she
seemed
to
take
a
secret
pleasure
in
exciting
the
monarch
to
expenses
that
made
his
treasury
shrink
and
then
treating
his
extravagant
generosity
as
a
mere
matter
of
course
with
all
his
assiduity
and
munificence
also
the
venerable
lover
could
not
flatter
himself
that
he
had
made
any
impression
on
her
heart
she
never
frowned
on
him
it
is
true
but
then
she
never
smiled
whenever
he
began
to
plead
his
passion
she
struck
her
silver
lyre
there
was
a
mystic
charm
in
the
sound
in
an
instant
the
monarch
began
to
nod
a
drowsiness
stole
over
him
and
he
gradually
sank
into
a
sleep
from
which
he
awoke
wonderfully
refreshed
but
perfectly
cooled
for
the
time
of
his
passion
this
was
very
baffling
to
his
suit
but
then
these
slumbers
were
accompanied
by
agreeable
dreams
which
completely
inthralled
the
senses
of
the
drowsy
lover
so
he
continued
to
dream
on
while
all
granada
scoffed
at
his
infatuation
and
groaned
at
the
treasures
lavished
for
a
song
at
length
a
danger
burst
on
the
head
of
aben
habuz
against
which
his
talisman
yielded
him
no
warning
an
insurrection
broke
out
in
his
very
capital
his
palace
was
surrounded
by
an
armed
rabble
who
menaced
his
life
and
the
life
of
his
christian
paramour
a
spark
of
his
ancient
warlike
spirit
was
awakened
in
the
breast
of
the
monarch
at
the
head
of
a
handful
of
his
guards
he
sallied
forth
put
the
rebels
to
flight
and
crushed
the
insurrection
in
the
bud
when
quiet
was
again
restored
he
sought
the
astrologer
who
still
remained
shut
up
in
his
hermitage
chewing
the
bitter
cud
of
resentment
aben
habuz
approached
him
with
a
conciliatory
tone
o
wise
son
of
abu
ayub
said
he
well
didst
thou
predict
dangers
to
me
from
this
captive
beauty
tell
me
then
thou
who
art
so
quick
at
foreseeing
peril
what
i
should
do
to
avert
put
from
thee
the
infidel
damsel
who
is
the
sooner
would
i
part
with
my
kingdom
cried
aben
habuz
thou
art
in
danger
of
losing
both
replied
the
astrologer
be
not
harsh
and
angry
o
most
profound
of
philosophers
consider
the
double
distress
of
a
monarch
and
a
lover
and
devise
some
means
of
protecting
me
from
the
evils
by
which
i
am
menaced
i
care
not
for
grandeur
i
care
not
for
power
i
languish
only
for
repose
would
that
i
had
some
quiet
retreat
where
i
might
take
refuge
from
the
world
and
all
its
cares
and
pomps
and
troubles
and
devote
the
remainder
of
my
days
to
tranquillity
and
the
astrologer
regarded
him
for
a
moment
from
under
his
bushy
eyebrows
and
what
wouldst
thou
give
if
i
could
provide
thee
such
a
retreat
thou
shouldst
name
thy
own
reward
and
whatever
it
might
be
if
within
the
scope
of
my
power
as
my
soul
liveth
it
should
be
thou
hast
heard
o
king
of
the
garden
of
irem
one
of
the
prodigies
of
arabia
the
i
have
heard
of
that
garden
it
is
recorded
in
the
koran
even
in
the
chapter
entitled
the
dawn
of
i
have
moreover
heard
marvellous
things
related
of
it
by
pilgrims
who
had
been
to
mecca
but
i
considered
them
wild
fables
such
as
travellers
are
wont
to
tell
who
have
visited
remote
discredit
not
o
king
the
tales
of
travellers
rejoined
the
astrologer
gravely
for
they
contain
precious
rarities
of
knowledge
brought
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
as
to
the
palace
and
garden
of
irem
what
is
generally
told
of
them
is
true
i
have
seen
them
with
mine
own
eyes
listen
to
my
adventure
for
it
has
a
bearing
upon
the
object
of
your
request
in
my
younger
days
when
a
mere
arab
of
the
desert
i
tended
my
father
s
camels
in
traversing
the
desert
of
aden
one
of
them
strayed
from
the
rest
and
was
lost
i
searched
after
it
for
several
days
but
in
vain
until
wearied
and
faint
i
laid
myself
down
at
noontide
and
slept
under
a
by
the
side
of
a
scanty
well
when
i
awoke
i
found
myself
at
the
gate
of
a
city
i
entered
and
beheld
noble
streets
and
squares
and
but
all
were
silent
and
without
an
inhabitant
i
wandered
on
until
i
came
to
a
sumptuous
palace
with
a
garden
adorned
with
fountains
and
and
groves
and
flowers
and
orchards
laden
with
delicious
fruit
but
still
no
one
was
to
be
seen
upon
which
appalled
at
this
loneliness
i
hastened
to
depart
and
after
issuing
forth
at
the
gate
of
the
city
i
turned
to
look
upon
the
place
but
it
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
nothing
but
the
silent
desert
extended
before
my
eyes
in
the
neighborhood
i
met
with
an
aged
dervise
learned
in
the
traditions
and
secrets
of
the
land
and
related
to
him
what
had
befallen
me
this
said
he
is
the
garden
of
irem
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
desert
it
only
appears
at
times
to
some
wanderer
like
thyself
gladdening
him
with
the
sight
of
towers
and
palaces
and
overhung
with
and
then
vanishes
leaving
nothing
but
a
lonely
desert
and
this
is
the
story
of
it
in
old
times
when
this
country
was
inhabited
by
the
addites
king
sheddad
the
son
of
ad
the
of
noah
founded
here
a
splendid
city
when
it
was
finished
and
he
saw
its
grandeur
his
heart
was
puffed
up
with
pride
and
arrogance
and
he
determined
to
build
a
royal
palace
with
gardens
which
should
rival
all
related
in
the
koran
of
the
celestial
paradise
but
the
curse
of
heaven
fell
upon
him
for
his
presumption
he
and
his
subjects
were
swept
from
the
earth
and
his
splendid
city
and
palace
and
gardens
were
laid
under
a
perpetual
spell
which
hides
them
from
human
sight
excepting
that
they
are
seen
at
intervals
by
way
of
keeping
his
sin
in
perpetual
this
story
o
king
and
the
wonders
i
had
seen
ever
dwelt
in
my
mind
and
in
when
i
had
been
in
egypt
and
was
possessed
of
the
book
of
knowledge
of
solomon
the
wise
i
determined
to
return
and
revisit
the
garden
of
irem
i
did
so
and
found
it
revealed
to
my
instructed
sight
i
took
possession
of
the
palace
of
sheddad
and
passed
several
days
in
his
mock
paradise
the
genii
who
watch
over
the
place
were
obedient
to
my
magic
power
and
revealed
to
me
the
spells
by
which
the
whole
garden
had
been
as
it
were
conjured
into
existence
and
by
which
it
was
rendered
invisible
such
a
palace
and
garden
o
king
can
i
make
for
thee
even
here
on
the
mountain
above
thy
city
do
i
not
know
all
the
secret
spells
and
am
i
not
in
possession
of
the
book
of
knowledge
of
solomon
the
wise
o
wise
son
of
abu
ayub
exclaimed
aben
habuz
trembling
with
eagerness
thou
art
a
traveller
indeed
and
hast
seen
and
learned
marvellous
things
contrive
me
such
a
paradise
and
ask
any
reward
even
to
the
half
of
my
alas
replied
the
other
thou
knowest
i
am
an
old
man
and
a
philosopher
and
easily
satisfied
all
the
reward
i
ask
is
the
first
beast
of
burden
with
its
load
which
shall
enter
the
magic
portal
of
the
the
monarch
gladly
agreed
to
so
moderate
a
stipulation
and
the
astrologer
began
his
work
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
immediately
above
his
subterranean
hermitage
he
caused
a
great
gateway
or
barbican
to
be
erected
opening
through
the
centre
of
a
strong
tower
there
was
an
outer
vestibule
or
porch
with
a
lofty
arch
and
within
it
a
portal
secured
by
massive
gates
on
the
keystone
of
the
portal
the
astrologer
with
his
own
hand
wrought
the
figure
of
a
huge
key
and
on
the
keystone
of
the
outer
arch
of
the
vestibule
which
was
loftier
than
that
of
the
portal
he
carved
a
gigantic
hand
these
were
potent
talismans
over
which
he
repeated
many
sentences
in
an
unknown
tongue
when
this
gateway
was
finished
he
shut
himself
up
for
two
days
in
his
astrological
hall
engaged
in
secret
incantations
on
the
third
he
ascended
the
hill
and
passed
the
whole
day
on
its
summit
at
a
late
hour
of
the
night
he
came
down
and
presented
himself
before
aben
habuz
at
length
o
king
said
he
my
labor
is
accomplished
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
stands
one
of
the
most
delectable
palaces
that
ever
the
head
of
man
devised
or
the
heart
of
man
desired
it
contains
sumptuous
halls
and
galleries
delicious
gardens
cool
fountains
and
fragrant
baths
in
a
word
the
whole
mountain
is
converted
into
a
paradise
like
the
garden
of
irem
it
is
protected
by
a
mighty
charm
which
hides
it
from
the
view
and
search
of
mortals
excepting
such
as
possess
the
secret
of
its

cried
aben
habuz
joyfully

with
the
first
light

will
ascend
and
take
the
happy
monarch

but
little
that
night
scarcely
had
the
rays
of
the
sun
begun
to
play
about
the
snowy
summit
of
the
sierra
nevada
when
he
mounted
his
steed
and
accompanied
only
by
a
few
chosen
attendants
ascended
a
steep
and
narrow
road
leading
up
the
hill
beside
him
on
a
white
palfrey
rode
the
gothic
princess
her
whole
dress
sparkling
with
jewels
while
round
her
neck
was
suspended
her
silver
lyre
the
astrologer
walked
on
the
other
side
of
the
king
assisting
his
steps
with
his
hieroglyphic
staff
for
he
never
mounted
steed
of
any
kind
aben
habuz
looked
to
see
the
towers
of
the
palace
brightening
above
him
and
the
embowered
terraces
of
its
gardens
stretching
along
the
heights
but
as
yet
nothing
of
the
kind
was
to
be
descried
that
is
the
mystery
and
safeguard
of
the
place
said
the
astrologer
nothing
can
be
discerned
until
you
have
passed
the
gateway
and
been
put
in
possession
of
the
as
they
approached
the
gateway
the
astrologer
paused
and
pointed
out
to
the
king
the
mystic
hand
and
key
carved
upon
the
portal
of
the
arch
these
said
he
are
the
talismans
which
guard
the
entrance
to
this
paradise
until
yonder
hand
shall
reach
down
and
seize
that
key
neither
mortal
power
nor
magic
artifice
can
prevail
against
the
lord
of
this
while
aben
habuz
was
gazing
with
open
mouth
and
silent
wonder
at
these
mystic
talismans
the
palfrey
of
the
princess
proceeded
and
bore
her
in
at
the
portal
to
the
very
centre
of
the
barbican

cried
the
astrologer
my
promised
reward
the
first
animal
with
its
burden
which
should
enter
the
magic
aben
habuz
smiled
at
what
he
considered
a
pleasantry
of
the
ancient
man
but
when
he
found
him
to
be
in
earnest
his
gray
beard
trembled
with
indignation
son
of
abu

said
he
sternly
what
equivocation
is
this
thou
knowest
the
meaning
of
my
promise
the
first
beast
of
burden
with
its
load
that
should
enter
this
portal
take
the
strongest
mule
in
my
stables
load
it
with
the
most
precious
things
of

dare
not
raise
thy

through
it
the
command

mine
by
right
thy
royal

is
pledged
i

as
my
the
princess
looked
down
haughtily
from
her
palfrey
and
a
light
smile
of
scorn
curled
her
rosy
lip
at
this
dispute
between
two
for
the
possession
of
youth
and
beauty
the
wrath
of

monarch
got
the
better
of

for

not

petty
kingdom
and
revel
in

of

for
me
i
will
laugh
at

in
my
philosophic
so
saying
he
seized
the
bridle
of

palfrey
smote
the
earth
with
his
staff
and
sank
with
the
gothic
princess
through
the
centre
of

barbican
the

closed
over
them
and
no
trace
remained
of
the
opening
by
which
they
had
descended
aben

was
struck
dumb
for
a
time
with
astonishment
recovering
himself
he
ordered
a
thousand
workmen
to
dig
with
pickaxe
and
spade
into
the
ground
where
the
astrologer
had
disappeared
they
digged
and
digged
but
in
vain
the
flinty
bosom
of
the
hill
resisted
their
implements
or
if
they
did
penetrate
a
little
way
the
earth
filled
in
again
as
fast
as
they
threw
it
out
aben

sought
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
at
the
foot
of

hill
leading
to
the
subterranean
palace
of

but
it
was

fixed
with
his

turned
toward

the

had
descended
as

there
still
lurked
the
deadliest
foe
of
aben
habuz
from
time
to
time
the
sound
of
music
and
the
tones
of
a
female
voice
could
be
faintly
heard
from
the
bosom
of
the
hill
and
a
peasant
one
day
brought
word
to
the
king
that
in
the
preceding
night
he
had
found
a
fissure
in
the
rock
by
which
he
had
crept
in
until
he
looked
down
into
a
subterranean
hall
in
which
sat
the
astrologer
on
a
magnificent
divan
slumbering
and
nodding
to
the
silver
lyre
of
the
princess
which
seemed
to
hold
a
magic
sway
over
his
senses
aben

sought
the
fissure
in

rock
but
it
was
again
closed
he
renewed
the
attempt
to
unearth
his
rival
but
all
in
vain
the
spell
of
the
hand
and
key
was
too
potent
to
be
counteracted
by
human
power
as
to
the
summit
of
the
mountain
the
site
of
the
promised
palace
and
garden
it
remained
a
naked
waste
either
the
boasted
elysium
was
hidden
from
sight
by
enchantment
or
was
a
mere
fable
of
the
astrologer
the

charitably
supposed
the
latter
and
some
used
to
call
the
place
the

folly

named
it

to
add
to
the
chagrin
of

the
neighbors
whom
he
had
defied
and
taunted
and
cut
up
at
his
leisure
while
master
of
the
talismanic
horseman
finding
him
no
longer
protected
by
magic
spell
made
inroads
into
his
territories
from
all
sides
and
the
remainder
of
the
life
of
the
most
pacific
of

was
a
tissue
of
turmoils
at

aben
habuz
died
and
was
buried
ages
have
since
rolled
away
the
alhambra
has
been
built
on
the
eventful
mountain
and
in
some
measure
realizes
the
fabled
delights
of
the
garden
of
irem
the
gateway
still
exists
entire
protected
no
doubt
by
the
mystic
hand
and
key
and
now
forms
the
gate
of
justice
the
grand
entrance
to
the
fortress
under
that
gateway
it
is
said
the
old
astrologer
remains
in
his
subterranean
hall
nodding
on
his
divan
lulled
by
the
silver
lyre
of
the
princess
the
old
invalid
sentinels
who
mount
guard
at
the
gate
hear
the
strains
occasionally
in
the
summer
nights
and
yielding
to
their
soporific
power
doze
quietly
at
their
posts
nay
so
drowsy
an
influence
pervades
the
place
that
even
those
who
watch
by
day
may
generally
be
seen
nodding
on
the
stone
benches
of
the
barbican
or
sleeping
under
the
neighboring
trees
so
that
in
fact
it
is
the
drowsiest
military
post
in
all
christendom
all
this
say
the
ancient
legends
will
endure
from
age
to
age
the
princess
will
remain
captive
to
the
astrologer
and
the
astrologer
bound
up
in
magic
slumber
by
the
princess
until
the
last
day
unless
the
mystic
hand
shall
grasp
the
fated
key
and
dispel
the
whole
charm
of
this
enchanted
mountain
note
to
the
arabian
astrologer
al
makkari
in
his
history
of
the
mahommedan
dynasties
in
spain
cites
from
another
arabian
writer
an
account
of
a
talismanic
effigy
somewhat
similar
to
the
one
in
the
foregoing
legend
in
cadiz
says
he
there
formerly
stood
a
square
tower
upwards
of
one
hundred
cubits
high
built
of
huge
blocks
of
stone
fastened
together
with
clamps
of
brass
on
the
top
was
the
figure
of
a
man
holding
a
staff
in
his
right
hand
his
face
turned
to
the
atlantic
and
pointing
with
the
forefinger
of
his
left
hand
to
the
straits
of
gibraltar
it
was
said
to
have
been
set
up
in
ancient
times
by
the
gothic
kings
of
andalus
as
a
beacon
or
guide
to
navigators
the
moslems
of
barbary
and
andalus
considered
it
a
talisman
which
exercised
a
spell
over
the
seas
under
its
guidance
swarms
of
piratical
people
of
a
nation
called
majus
appeared
on
the
coast
in
large
vessels
with
a
square
sail
in
the
bow
and
another
in
the
stern
they
came
every
six
or
seven
years
captured
everything
they
met
with
on
the
sea
guided
by
the
statue
they
passed
through
the
straits
into
the
mediterranean
landed
on
the
coasts
of
andalus
laid
everything
waste
with
fire
and
sword
and
sometimes
carried
their
depredations
on
the
opposite
coasts
even
as
far
as
syria
at
length
it
came
to
pass
in
the
time
of
the
civil
wars
a
moslem
admiral
who
had
taken
possession
of
cadiz
hearing
that
the
statue
on
top
of
the
tower
was
of
pure
gold
had
it
lowered
to
the
ground
and
broken
to
pieces
when
it
proved
to
be
of
gilded
brass
with
the
destruction
of
the
idol
the
spell
over
the
sea
was
at
an
end
from
that
time
forward
nothing
more
was
seen
of
the
piratical
people
of
the
ocean
excepting
that
two
of
their
barks
were
wrecked
on
the
coast
one
at
the
port
of
the
majus
the
other
close
to
the
promontory
of
al
aghan
the
maritime
invaders
above
mentioned
by
al
makkari
must
have
been
the
northmen
visitors
to
the
alhambra
for
nearly
three
months
had
i
enjoyed
undisturbed
my
dream
of
sovereignty
in
the
alhambra
a
longer
term
of
quiet
than
had
been
the
lot
of
many
of
my
predecessors
during
this
lapse
of
time
the
progress
of
the
season
had
wrought
the
usual
change
on
my
arrival
i
had
found
everything
in
the
freshness
of
may
the
foliage
of
the
trees
was
still
tender
and
transparent
the
pomegranate
had
not
yet
shed
its
brilliant
crimson
blossoms
the
orchards
of
the
xenil
and
the
darro
were
in
full
bloom
the
rocks
were
hung
with
wild
flowers
and
granada
seemed
completely
surrounded
by
a
wilderness
of
roses
among
which
innumerable
nightingales
sang
not
merely
in
the
night
but
all
day
long
now
the
advance
of
summer
had
withered
the
rose
and
silenced
the
nightingale
and
the
distant
country
began
to
look
parched
and
sunburnt
though
a
perennial
verdure
reigned
immediately
round
the
city
and
in
the
deep
narrow
valleys
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
the
alhambra
possesses
retreats
graduated
to
the
heat
of
the
weather
among
which
the
most
peculiar
is
the
almost
subterranean
apartment
of
the
baths
this
still
retains
its
ancient
oriental
character
though
stamped
with
the
touching
traces
of
decline
at
the
entrance
opening
into
a
small
court
formerly
adorned
with
flowers
is
a
hall
moderate
in
size
but
light
and
graceful
in
architecture
it
is
overlooked
by
a
small
gallery
supported
by
marble
pillars
and
moresco
arches
an
alabaster
fountain
in
the
centre
of
the
pavement
still
throws
up
a
jet
of
water
to
cool
the
place
on
each
side
are
deep
alcoves
with
raised
platforms
where
the
bathers
after
their
ablutions
reclined
on
cushions
soothed
to
voluptuous
repose
by
the
fragrance
of
the
perfumed
air
and
the
notes
of
soft
music
from
the
gallery
beyond
this
hall
are
the
interior
chambers
still
more
retired
the
of
female
privacy
for
here
the
beauties
of
the
harem
indulged
in
the
luxury
of
the
baths
a
soft
mysterious
light
reigns
through
the
place
admitted
through
small
apertures
lumbreras
in
the
vaulted
ceiling
the
traces
of
ancient
elegance
are
still
to
be
seen
and
the
alabaster
baths
in
which
the
sultanas
once
reclined
the
prevailing
obscurity
and
silence
have
made
these
vaults
a
favorite
resort
of
bats
who
nestle
during
the
day
in
the
dark
nooks
and
corners
and
on
being
disturbed
flit
mysteriously
about
the
twilight
chambers
heightening
in
an
indescribable
degree
their
air
of
desertion
and
decay
in
this
cool
and
elegant
though
dilapidated
retreat
which
had
the
freshness
and
seclusion
of
a
grotto
i
passed
the
sultry
hours
of
the
day
as
summer
advanced
emerging
towards
sunset
and
bathing
or
rather
swimming
at
night
in
the
great
reservoir
of
the
main
court
in
this
way
i
was
enabled
in
a
measure
to
counteract
the
relaxing
and
enervating
influence
of
the
climate
my
dream
of
absolute
sovereignty
however
came
at
length
to
an
end
i
was
roused
one
morning
by
the
report
of
which
reverberated
among
the
towers
as
if
the
castle
had
been
taken
by
surprise
on
sallying
forth
i
found
an
old
cavalier
with
a
number
of
domestics
in
possession
of
the
hall
of
ambassadors
he
was
an
ancient
count
who
had
come
up
from
his
palace
in
granada
to
pass
a
short
time
in
the
alhambra
for
the
benefit
of
purer
air
and
who
being
a
veteran
and
inveterate
sportsman
was
endeavoring
to
get
an
appetite
for
his
breakfast
by
shooting
at
swallows
from
the
balconies
it
was
a
harmless
amusement
for
though
by
the
alertness
of
his
attendants
in
loading
his
pieces
he
was
enabled
to
keep
up
a
brisk
fire
i
could
not
accuse
him
of
the
death
of
a
single
swallow
nay
the
birds
themselves
seemed
to
enjoy
the
sport
and
to
deride
his
want
of
skill
skimming
in
circles
close
to
the
balconies
and
twittering
as
they
darted
by
the
arrival
of
this
old
gentleman
changed
essentially
the
aspect
of
affairs
but
caused
no
jealousy
nor
collision
we
tacitly
shared
the
empire
between
us
like
the
last
kings
of
granada
excepting
that
we
maintained
a
most
amicable
alliance
he
reigned
absolute
over
the
court
of
the
lions
and
its
adjacent
halls
while
i
maintained
peaceful
possession
of
the
regions
of
the
baths
and
the
little
garden
of
lindaraxa
we
took
our
meals
together
under
the
arcades
of
the
court
where
the
fountains
cooled
the
air
and
bubbling
rills
ran
along
the
channels
of
the
marble
pavement
in
the
evenings
a
domestic
circle
would
gather
about
the
worthy
old
cavalier
the
countess
his
wife
by
a
second
marriage
would
come
up
from
the
city
accompanied
by
her
carmen
an
only
child
a
charming
little
being
still
in
her
girlish
years
then
there
were
always
some
of
his
official
dependants
his
chaplain
his
lawyer
his
secretary
his
steward
and
other
officers
and
agents
of
his
extensive
possessions
who
brought
him
up
the
news
or
gossip
of
the
city
and
formed
his
evening
party
of
tresillo
or
ombre
thus
he
held
a
kind
of
domestic
court
where
each
one
paid
him
deference
and
sought
to
contribute
to
his
amusement
without
however
any
appearance
of
servility
or
any
sacrifice
of
in
fact
nothing
of
the
kind
was
exacted
by
the
demeanor
of
the
count
for
whatever
may
be
said
of
spanish
pride
it
rarely
chills
or
constrains
the
intercourse
of
social
or
domestic
life
among
no
people
are
the
relations
between
kindred
more
unreserved
and
cordial
or
between
superior
and
dependant
more
free
from
haughtiness
on
the
one
side
and
obsequiousness
on
the
other
in
these
respects
there
still
remains
in
spanish
life
especially
in
the
provinces
much
of
the
vaunted
simplicity
of
the
olden
time
the
most
interesting
member
of
this
family
group
in
my
eyes
was
the
daughter
of
the
count
the
lovely
little
carmen
she
was
but
about
sixteen
years
of
age
and
appeared
to
be
considered
a
mere
child
though
the
idol
of
the
family
going
generally
by
the
childlike
but
endearing
appellation
of
la
niña
her
form
had
not
yet
attained
full
maturity
and
development
but
possessed
already
the
exquisite
symmetry
and
pliant
grace
so
prevalent
in
this
country
her
blue
eyes
fair
complexion
and
light
hair
were
unusual
in
andalusia
and
gave
a
mildness
and
gentleness
to
her
demeanor
in
contrast
to
the
usual
fire
of
spanish
beauty
but
in
unison
with
the
guileless
and
confiding
innocence
of
her
manners
she
had
at
the
same
time
the
innate
aptness
and
versatility
of
her
fascinating
whatever
she
undertook
to
do
she
did
well
and
apparently
without
effort
she
sang
played
the
guitar
and
other
instruments
and
danced
the
picturesque
dances
of
her
country
to
admiration
but
never
seemed
to
seek
admiration
everything
was
spontaneous
prompted
by
her
own
gay
spirits
and
happy
temper
the
presence
of
this
fascinating
little
being
spread
a
new
charm
about
the
alhambra
and
seemed
to
be
in
unison
with
the
place
while
the
count
and
countess
with
the
chaplain
or
secretary
were
playing
their
game
of
tresillo
under
the
vestibule
of
the
court
of
lions
she
attended
by
dolores
who
acted
as
her
maid
of
honor
would
sit
by
one
of
the
fountains
and
accompanying
herself
on
the
guitar
would
sing
some
of
those
popular
romances
which
abound
in
spain
or
what
was
still
more
to
my
taste
some
traditional
ballad
about
the
moors
never
shall
i
think
of
the
alhambra
without
remembering
this
lovely
little
being
sporting
in
happy
and
innocent
girlhood
in
its
marble
halls
dancing
to
the
sound
of
the
moorish
castanets
or
mingling
the
silver
warbling
of
her
voice
with
the
music
of
its
fountains
relics
and
genealogies
if
i
had
been
pleased
and
interested
by
the
count
and
his
family
as
furnishing
a
picture
of
a
spanish
domestic
life
i
was
still
more
so
when
apprised
of
historical
circumstances
which
linked
them
with
the
heroic
times
of
granada
in
fact
in
this
worthy
old
cavalier
so
totally
unwarlike
or
whose
deeds
in
arms
extended
at
most
to
a
war
on
swallows
and
martlets
i
discovered
a
lineal
descendant
and
actual
representative
of
gonsalvo
of
cordova
the
grand
captain
who
won
some
of
his
brightest
laurels
before
the
walls
of
granada
and
was
one
of
the
cavaliers
commissioned
by
ferdinand
and
isabella
to
negotiate
the
terms
of
surrender
nay
more
the
count
was
entitled
did
he
choose
it
to
claim
remote
affinity
with
some
of
the
ancient
moorish
princes
through
a
scion
of
his
house
don
pedro
venegas
surnamed
the
tornadizo
and
by
the
same
token
his
daughter
the
fascinating
little
carmen
might
claim
to
be
rightful
representative
of
the
princess
cetimerien
or
the
beautiful
lindaraxa
understanding
from
the
count
that
he
had
some
curious
relics
of
the
conquest
preserved
in
his
family
archives
i
accompanied
him
early
one
morning
down
to
his
palace
in
granada
to
examine
them
the
most
important
of
these
relics
was
the
sword
of
the
grand
captain
a
weapon
destitute
of
all
ostentatious
ornament
as
the
weapons
of
great
generals
are
apt
to
be
with
a
plain
hilt
of
ivory
and
a
broad
thin
blade
it
might
furnish
a
comment
on
hereditary
honors
to
see
the
sword
of
the
grand
captain
legitimately
declined
into
such
feeble
hands
the
other
relics
of
the
conquest
were
a
number
of
espingardas
or
muskets
of
unwieldy
size
and
ponderous
weight
worthy
to
rank
with
those
enormous
swords
preserved
in
old
armories
which
look
like
relics
from
the
days
of
the
giants
beside
other
hereditary
honors
i
found
the
old
count
was
alferez
mayor
or
grand
in
which
capacity
he
was
entitled
to
bear
the
ancient
standard
of
ferdinand
and
isabella
on
certain
high
and
solemn
occasions
and
to
wave
it
over
their
tombs
i
was
shown
also
the
caparisons
of
velvet
sumptuously
embroidered
with
gold
and
silver
for
six
horses
with
which
he
appeared
in
state
when
a
new
sovereign
was
to
be
proclaimed
in
granada
and
seville
the
count
mounting
one
of
the
horses
and
the
other
five
being
led
by
lackeys
in
rich
liveries
i
had
hoped
to
find
among
the
relics
and
antiquities
of
the
count
s
palace
some
specimens
of
the
armor
and
weapons
of
the
moors
of
granada
such
as
i
had
heard
were
preserved
as
trophies
by
the
descendants
of
the
conquerors
but
in
this
i
was
disappointed
i
was
the
more
curious
in
this
particular
because
an
erroneous
idea
has
been
entertained
by
many
as
to
the
costumes
of
the
moors
of
spain
supposing
them
to
be
of
the
usual
oriental
type
on
the
contrary
we
have
it
on
the
authority
of
their
own
writers
that
they
adopted
in
many
respects
the
fashions
of
the
christians
the
turban
especially
so
identified
in
idea
with
the
moslem
was
generally
abandoned
except
in
the
western
provinces
where
it
continued

a
woollen
cap
red
or
green
was
commonly
worn
as
a
substitute
probably
the
same
kind
originating
in
barbary
and
known
by
the
name
of
tunis
or
fez
which
at
the
present
day
is
worn
throughout

generally
under

the

were

to
wear
them
of

color

and
other
eastern
provinces
men
of

a
short
cloak
called
taylasan
similar
to
that
seen
in
spain
in
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
was
worn
by
all
ranks
it
had
a

sometimes
drew
over

equipped
for

very
much
in
the
christian
style
over
a
complete
suit
of

he
wore
a
short
scarlet
tunic
his
helmet
was
of

slung
at

wielded
a

with
a
broad
point
sometimes
a

was
cumbrous
projecting
very
much
in

he
rode
with
a

fluttering
behind
him
in
the
time
of
al
khattib
of
granada
who
wrote
in
the
fourteenth
century
the
moslems
of
andalus
had
resumed
the
oriental
costumes

were
again
clad

a
wonderful
luxury
prevailed
at
that
time
in
the
arms
and
equipments
of
the
granadian
cavaliers
their
armor
was
inlaid
with
gold
and
silver
their
cimeters
were
of
the
keenest
damascus
blades
with
sheaths
richly
wrought
and
enamelled
and
belts
of
golden
filigree
studded
with
gems
their
daggers
of

had
jewelled
hilts
and
their
lances
were
set
off
with
gay
banderoles
their
horses
were
caparisoned
in
correspondent
style
with
velvet
and
embroidery
all
this
minute
description
given
by
a
contemporary
and
an
author
of
distinction
verifies
those
gallant
pictures
in
the
old
morisco
spanish
ballads
which
have
sometimes
been
deemed
apocryphal
and
give
a
vivid
idea
of
the
brilliant
appearance
of
the
chivalry
of
granada
when
marshalled
forth
in
warlike
array
or
when
celebrating
the
chivalrous
fêtes
of

rise
the
lofty
towers
and
white
walls
of
the

a
fairy
palace
full
of
storied
recollections
here
are
still
to
be
seen
the
famous
cypresses
of
enormous
size
which
flourished
in
the
time
of
the
moors
and
which
tradition
has
connected
with
the
fabulous
story
of
boabdil
and
his
sultana
here
are
preserved
the
portraits
of

who
figured
in
the
romantic

the
moorish

from

from
one
of
these
princes
who
joined

the
proprietor
however
dwells
in
a
foreign

and
the

has
no

a
princely
inhabitant
yet
here
is
everything
to
delight
a
southern
voluptuary
fruits
flowers
fragrance
green
arbors
and
myrtle
hedges
delicate
air
and
gushing
waters
here
i
had
an
opportunity
of
witnessing
those
scenes
which
painters
are
fond
of
depicting
about
southern
palaces
and
gardens
it
was
the
saint
s
day
of
the
count
s
daughter
and
she
had
brought
up
several
of
her
youthful
companions
from
granada
to
sport
away
a
long
summer
s
day
among
the
breezy
halls
and
bowers
of
the
moorish
palaces
a
visit
to
the
generalife
was
the
morning
s
entertainment
here
some
of
the
gay
company
dispersed
itself
in
groups
about
the
green
walks
the
bright
fountains
the
flights
of
italian
steps
the
noble
terraces
and
marble
balustrades
others
among
whom
i
was
one
took
their
seats
in
an
open
gallery
or
colonnade
commanding
a
vast
prospect
with
the
alhambra
the
city
and
the
vega
far
below
and
the
distant
horizon
of
mountains
a
dreamy
world
all
glimmering
to
the
eye
in
summer
sunshine
while
thus
seated
the
tinkling
of
the
guitar
and
click
of
the
castanets
came
stealing
up
from
the
valley
of
the
darro
and
down
the
mountain
we
descried
a
festive
party
under
the
trees
enjoying
themselves
in
true
andalusian
style
some
lying
on
the
grass
others
dancing
to
the
music
all
these
sights
and
sounds
together
with
the
princely
seclusion
of
the
place
the
sweet
quiet
which
prevailed
around
and
the
delicious
serenity
of
the
weather
had
a
witching
effect
upon
the
mind
and
drew
from
some
of
the
company
versed
in
local
story
several
of
the
popular
fancies
and
traditions
connected
with
this
old
moorish
palace
they
were
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
of
but
out
of
them
i
have
shaped
the
following
legend
which
i
hope
may
have
the
good
fortune
to
prove
acceptable
to
the
reader
legend
of
prince
ahmed
al
kamel
or
the
pilgrim
of
love
there
was
once
a
moorish
king
of
granada
who
had
but
one
son
whom
he
named
ahmed
to
which
his
courtiers
added
the
surname
of
al
kamel
or
the
perfect
from
the
indubitable
signs
of
superexcellence
which
they
perceived
in
him
in
his
very
infancy
the
astrologers
countenanced
them
in
their
foresight
predicting
everything
in
his
favor
that
could
make
a
perfect
prince
and
a
prosperous
sovereign
one
cloud
only
rested
upon
his
destiny
and
even
that
was
of
a
roseate
hue
he
would
be
of
an
amorous
temperament
and
run
great
perils
from
the
tender
passion
if
however
he
could
be
kept
from
the
allurements
of
love
until
of
mature
age
these
dangers
would
be
averted
and
his
life
thereafter
be
one
uninterrupted
course
of
felicity
to
prevent
all
danger
of
the
kind
the
king
wisely
determined
to
rear
the
prince
in
a
seclusion
where
he
should
never
see
a
female
face
nor
hear
even
the
name
of
love
for
this
purpose
he
built
a
beautiful
palace
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
above
the
alhambra
in
the
midst
of
delightful
gardens
but
surrounded
by
lofty
walls
being
in
fact
the
same
palace
known
at
the
present
day
by
the
name
of
the
generalife
in
this
palace
the
youthful
prince
was
shut
up
and
intrusted
to
the
guardianship
and
instruction
of
eben
bonabben
one
of
the
wisest
and
dryest
of
arabian
sages
who
had
passed
the
greatest
part
of
his
life
in
egypt
studying
hieroglyphics
and
making
researches
among
the
tombs
and
pyramids
and
who
saw
more
charms
in
an
egyptian
mummy
than
in
the
most
tempting
of
living
beauties
the
sage
was
ordered
to
instruct
the
prince
in
all
kinds
of
knowledge
but
one
he
was
to
be
kept
utterly
ignorant
of
love
use
every
precaution
for
the
purpose
you
may
think
proper
said
the
king
but
remember
o
eben
bonabben
if
my
son
learns
aught
of
that
forbidden
knowledge
while
under
your
care
your
head
shall
answer
for
a
withered
smile
came
over
the
dry
visage
of
the
wise
bonabben
at
the
menace
let
your
majesty
s
heart
be
as
easy
about
your
son
as
mine
is
about
my
head
am
i
a
man
likely
to
give
lessons
in
the
idle
passion
under
the
vigilant
care
of
the
philosopher
the
prince
grew
up
in
the
seclusion
of
the
palace
and
its
gardens
he
had
black
slaves
to
attend
upon
him
hideous
mutes
who
knew
nothing
of
love
or
if
they
did
had
not
words
to
communicate
it
his
mental
endowments
were
the
peculiar
care
of
eben
bonabben
who
sought
to
initiate
him
into
the
abstruse
lore
of
egypt
but
in
this
the
prince
made
little
progress
and
it
was
soon
evident
that
he
had
no
turn
for
philosophy
he
was
however
amazingly
ductile
for
a
youthful
prince
ready
to
follow
any
advice
and
always
guided
by
the
last
counsellor
he
suppressed
his
yawns
and
listened
patiently
to
the
long
and
learned
discourses
of
eben
bonabben
from
which
he
imbibed
a
smattering
of
various
kinds
of
knowledge
and
thus
happily
attained
his
twentieth
year
a
miracle
of
princely
wisdom
but
totally
ignorant
of
love
about
this
time
however
a
change
came
over
the
conduct
of
the
prince
he
completely
abandoned
his
studies
and
took
to
strolling
about
the
gardens
and
musing
by
the
side
of
the
fountains
he
had
been
taught
a
little
music
among
his
various
accomplishments
it
now
engrossed
a
great
part
of
his
time
and
a
turn
for
poetry
became
apparent
the
sage
eben
bonabben
took
the
alarm
and
endeavored
to
work
these
idle
humors
out
of
him
by
a
severe
course
of
algebra
but
the
prince
turned
from
it
with
distaste
i
can
not
endure
algebra
said
he
it
is
an
abomination
to
me
i
want
something
that
speaks
more
to
the
the
sage
eben
bonabben
shook
his
dry
head
at
the
words
here
is
an
end
to
philosophy
thought
he
the
prince
has
discovered
he
has
a
heart
he
now
kept
anxious
watch
upon
his
pupil
and
saw
that
the
latent
tenderness
of
his
nature
was
in
activity
and
only
wanted
an
object
he
wandered
about
the
gardens
of
the
generalife
in
an
intoxication
of
feelings
of
which
he
knew
not
the
cause
sometimes
he
would
sit
plunged
in
a
delicious
reverie
then
he
would
seize
his
lute
and
draw
from
it
the
most
touching
notes
and
then
throw
it
aside
and
break
forth
into
sighs
and
ejaculations
by
degrees
this
loving
disposition
began
to
extend
to
inanimate
objects
he
had
his
favorite
flowers
which
he
cherished
with
tender
assiduity
then
he
became
attached
to
various
trees
and
there
was
one
in
particular
of
a
graceful
form
and
drooping
foliage
on
which
he
lavished
his
amorous
devotion
carving
his
name
on
its
bark
hanging
garlands
on
its
branches
and
singing
couplets
in
its
praise
to
the
accompaniment
of
his
lute
eben
bonabben
was
alarmed
at
this
excited
state
of
his
pupil
he
saw
him
on
the
very
brink
of
forbidden
knowledge
the
least
hint
might
reveal
to
him
the
fatal
secret
trembling
for
the
safety
of
the
prince
and
the
security
of
his
own
head
he
hastened
to
draw
him
from
the
seductions
of
the
garden
and
shut
him
up
in
the
highest
tower
of
the
generalife
it
contained
beautiful
apartments
and
commanded
an
almost
boundless
prospect
but
was
elevated
far
above
that
atmosphere
of
sweets
and
those
witching
bowers
so
dangerous
to
the
feelings
of
the
too
susceptible
ahmed
what
was
to
be
done
however
to
reconcile
him
to
this
restraint
and
to
beguile
the
tedious
hours
he
had
exhausted
almost
all
kinds
of
agreeable
knowledge
and
algebra
was
not
to
be
mentioned
fortunately
eben
bonabben
had
been
instructed
when
in
egypt
in
the
language
of
birds
by
a
jewish
rabbin
who
had
received
it
in
lineal
transmission
from
solomon
the
wise
who
had
been
taught
it
by
the
queen
of
sheba
at
the
very
mention
of
such
a
study
the
eyes
of
the
prince
sparkled
with
animation
and
he
applied
himself
to
it
with
such
avidity
that
he
soon
became
as
great
an
adept
as
his
master
the
tower
of
the
generalife
was
no
longer
a
solitude
he
had
companions
at
hand
with
whom
he
could
converse
the
first
acquaintance
he
formed
was
with
a
hawk
who
built
his
nest
in
a
crevice
of
the
lofty
battlements
whence
he
soared
far
and
wide
in
quest
of
prey
the
prince
however
found
little
to
like
or
esteem
in
him
he
was
a
mere
pirate
of
the
air
swaggering
and
boastful
whose
talk
was
all
about
rapine
and
carnage
and
desperate
exploits
his
next
acquaintance
was
an
owl
a
mighty
bird
with
a
huge
head
and
staring
eyes
who
sat
blinking
and
goggling
all
day
in
a
hole
in
the
wall
but
roamed
forth
at
night
he
had
great
pretensions
to
wisdom
talked
something
of
astrology
and
the
moon
and
hinted
at
the
dark
sciences
he
was
grievously
given
to
metaphysics
and
the
prince
found
his
prosings
even
more
ponderous
than
those
of
the
sage
eben
bonabben
then
there
was
a
bat
that
hung
all
day
by
his
heels
in
the
dark
corner
of
a
vault
but
sallied
out
in
slipshod
style
at
twilight
he
however
had
but
twilight
ideas
on
all
subjects
derided
things
of
which
he
had
taken
but
an
imperfect
view
and
seemed
to
take
delight
in
nothing
besides
these
there
was
a
swallow
with
whom
the
prince
was
at
first
much
taken
he
was
a
smart
talker
but
restless
bustling
and
forever
on
the
wing
seldom
remaining
long
enough
for
any
continued
conversation
he
turned
out
in
the
end
to
be
a
mere
smatterer
who
did
but
skim
over
the
surface
of
things
pretending
to
know
everything
but
knowing
nothing
thoroughly
these
were
the
only
feathered
associates
with
whom
the
prince
had
any
opportunity
of
exercising
his
newly
acquired
language
the
tower
was
too
high
for
any
other
birds
to
frequent
it
he
soon
grew
weary
of
his
new
acquaintances
whose
conversation
spoke
so
little
to
the
head
and
nothing
to
the
heart
and
gradually
relapsed
into
his
loneliness
a
winter
passed
away
spring
opened
with
all
its
bloom
and
verdure
and
breathing
sweetness
and
the
happy
time
arrived
for
birds
to
pair
and
build
their
nests
suddenly
as
it
were
a
universal
burst
of
song
and
melody
broke
forth
from
the
groves
and
gardens
of
the
generalife
and
reached
the
prince
in
the
solitude
of
his
tower
from
every
side
he
heard
the
same
universal
theme
love
love
love
chanted
forth
and
responded
to
it
in
every
variety
of
note
and
tone
the
prince
listened
in
silence
and
perplexity
what
can
be
this
love
thought
he
of
which
the
world
seems
so
full
and
of
which
i
know
nothing
he
applied
for
information
to
his
friend
the
hawk
the
ruffian
bird
answered
in
a
tone
of
scorn
you
must
apply
said
he
to
the
vulgar
peaceable
birds
of
earth
who
are
made
for
the
prey
of
us
princes
of
the
air
my
trade
is
war
and
fighting
my
delight
i
am
a
warrior
and
know
nothing
of
this
thing
called
the
prince
turned
from
him
with
disgust
and
sought
the
owl
in
his
retreat
this
is
a
bird
said
he
of
peaceful
habits
and
may
be
able
to
solve
my
so
he
asked
the
owl
to
tell
him
what
was
this
love
about
which
all
the
birds
in
the
groves
below
were
singing
upon
this
the
owl
put
on
a
look
of
offended
dignity
my
nights
said
he
are
taken
up
in
study
and
research
and
my
days
in
ruminating
in
my
cell
upon
all
that
i
have
learnt
as
to
these
singing
birds
of
whom
you
talk
i
never
listen
to
them
i
despise
them
and
their
themes
allah
be
praised
i
can
not
sing
i
am
a
philosopher
and
know
nothing
of
this
thing
called
the
prince
now
repaired
to
the
vault
where
his
friend
the
bat
was
hanging
by
the
heels
and
propounded
the
same
question
the
bat
wrinkled
up
his
nose
into
a
most
snappish
expression
why
do
you
disturb
me
in
my
morning
s
nap
with
such
an
idle
question
said
he
peevishly
i
only
fly
by
twilight
when
all
birds
are
asleep
and
never
trouble
myself
with
their
concerns
i
am
neither
bird
nor
beast
and
i
thank
heaven
for
it
i
have
found
out
the
villany
of
the
whole
of
them
and
hate
them
one
and
all
in
a
word
i
am
a
misanthrope
and
know
nothing
of
this
thing
called
as
a
last
resort
the
prince
now
sought
the
swallow
and
stopped
him
just
as
he
was
circling
about
the
summit
of
the
tower
the
swallow
as
usual
was
in
a
prodigious
hurry
and
had
scarce
time
to
make
a
reply
upon
my
word
said
he
i
have
so
much
public
business
to
attend
to
and
so
many
pursuits
to
follow
that
i
have
had
no
time
to
think
on
the
subject
i
have
every
day
a
thousand
visits
to
pay
a
thousand
affairs
of
importance
to
examine
into
that
leave
me
not
a
moment
of
leisure
for
these
little
matters
in
a
word
i
am
a
citizen
of
the
world
i
know
nothing
of
this
thing
called
so
saying
the
swallow
dived
into
the
valley
and
was
out
of
sight
in
a
moment
the
prince
remained
disappointed
and
perplexed
but
with
his
curiosity
still
more
piqued
by
the
difficulty
of
gratifying
it
while
in
this
mood
his
ancient
guardian
entered
the
tower
the
prince
advanced
eagerly
to
meet
him
o
eben
bonabben
cried
he
thou
hast
revealed
to
me
much
of
the
wisdom
of
the
earth
but
there
is
one
thing
of
which
i
remain
in
utter
ignorance
and
would
fain
be
my
prince
has
but
to
make
the
inquiry
and
everything
within
the
limited
range
of
his
servant
s
intellect
is
at
his
tell
me
then
o
most
profound
of
sages
what
is
the
nature
of
this
thing
called
love
eben
bonabben
was
struck
as
with
a
thunderbolt
he
trembled
and
turned
pale
and
felt
as
if
his
head
sat
but
loosely
on
his
shoulders
what
could
suggest
such
a
question
to
my
prince
where
could
he
have
learnt
so
idle
a
word
the
prince
led
him
to
the
window
of
the
tower
listen
o
eben
bonabben
said
he
the
sage
listened
the
nightingale
sat
in
a
thicket
below
the
tower
singing
to
his
paramour
the
rose
from
every
blossomed
spray
and
tufted
grove
rose
a
strain
of
melody
and
love
love
love
was
still
the
unvarying
strain
allah
akbar
god
is
great
exclaimed
the
wise
bonabben
who
shall
pretend
to
keep
this
secret
from
the
heart
of
man
when
even
the
birds
of
the
air
conspire
to
betray
it
then
turning
to
ahmed
o
my
prince
cried
he
shut
thine
ears
to
these
seductive
strains
close
thy
mind
against
this
dangerous
knowledge
know
that
this
love
is
the
cause
of
half
the
ills
of
wretched
mortality
it
is
this
which
produces
bitterness
and
strife
between
brethren
and
friends
which
causes
treacherous
murder
and
desolating
war
care
and
sorrow
weary
days
and
sleepless
nights
are
its
attendants
it
withers
the
bloom
and
blights
the
joy
of
youth
and
brings
on
the
ills
and
griefs
of
premature
old
age
allah
preserve
thee
my
prince
in
total
ignorance
of
this
thing
called
love
the
sage
eben
bonabben
hastily
retired
leaving
the
prince
plunged
in
still
deeper
perplexity
it
was
in
vain
he
attempted
to
dismiss
the
subject
from
his
mind
it
still
continued
uppermost
in
his
thoughts
and
teased
and
exhausted
him
with
vain
conjectures
surely
said
he
to
himself
as
he
listened
to
the
tuneful
strains
of
the
birds
there
is
no
sorrow
in
those
notes
everything
seems
tenderness
and
joy
if
love
be
a
cause
of
such
wretchedness
and
strife
why
are
not
these
birds
drooping
in
solitude
or
tearing
each
other
in
pieces
instead
of
fluttering
cheerfully
about
the
groves
or
sporting
with
each
other
among
flowers
he
lay
one
morning
on
his
couch
meditating
on
this
inexplicable
matter
the
window
of
his
chamber
was
open
to
admit
the
soft
morning
breeze
which
came
laden
with
the
perfume
of
from
the
valley
of
the
darro
the
voice
of
the
nightingale
was
faintly
heard
still
chanting
the
wonted
theme
as
the
prince
was
listening
and
sighing
there
was
a
sudden
rushing
noise
in
the
air
a
beautiful
dove
pursued
by
a
hawk
darted
in
at
the
window
and
fell
panting
on
the
floor
while
the
pursuer
balked
of
his
prey
soared
off
to
the
mountains
the
prince
took
up
the
gasping
bird
smoothed
its
feathers
and
nestled
it
in
his
bosom
when
he
had
soothed
it
by
his
caresses
he
put
it
in
a
golden
cage
and
offered
it
with
his
own
hands
the
whitest
and
finest
of
wheat
and
the
purest
of
water
the
bird
however
refused
food
and
sat
drooping
and
pining
and
uttering
piteous
moans
what
aileth
thee
said
ahmed
hast
thou
not
everything
thy
heart
can
wish
alas
no
replied
the
dove
am
i
not
separated
from
the
partner
of
my
heart
and
that
too
in
the
happy
the
very
season
of
love
of
love
echoed
ahmed
i
pray
thee
my
pretty
bird
canst
thou
then
tell
me
what
is
love
too
well
can
i
my
prince
it
is
the
torment
of
one
the
felicity
of
two
the
strife
and
enmity
of
three
it
is
a
charm
which
draws
two
beings
together
and
unites
them
by
delicious
sympathies
making
it
happiness
to
be
with
each
other
but
misery
to
be
apart
is
there
no
being
to
whom
you
are
drawn
by
these
ties
of
tender
affection
i
like
my
old
teacher
eben
bonabben
better
than
any
other
being
but
he
is
often
tedious
and
i
occasionally
feel
myself
happier
without
his
that
is
not
the
sympathy
i
mean
i
speak
of
love
the
great
mystery
and
principle
of
life
the
intoxicating
revel
of
youth
the
sober
delight
of
age
look
forth
my
prince
and
behold
how
at
this
blest
season
all
nature
is
full
of
love
every
created
being
has
its
mate
the
most
insignificant
bird
sings
to
its
paramour
the
very
beetle
wooes
its
in
the
dust
and
yon
butterflies
which
you
see
fluttering
high
above
the
tower
and
toying
in
the
air
are
happy
in
each
other
s
loves
alas
my
prince
hast
thou
spent
so
many
of
the
precious
days
of
youth
without
knowing
anything
of
love
is
there
no
gentle
being
of
another
sex
no
beautiful
princess
nor
lovely
damsel
who
has
ensnared
your
heart
and
filled
your
bosom
with
a
soft
tumult
of
pleasing
pains
and
tender
wishes
i
begin
to
understand
said
the
prince
sighing
such
a
tumult
i
have
more
than
once
experienced
without
knowing
the
cause
and
where
should
i
seek
for
an
object
such
as
you
describe
in
this
dismal
solitude
a
little
further
conversation
ensued
and
the
first
amatory
lesson
of
the
prince
was
complete
alas
said
he
if
love
be
indeed
such
a
delight
and
its
interruption
such
a
misery
allah
forbid
that
i
should
mar
the
joy
of
any
of
its
he
opened
the
cage
took
out
the
dove
and
having
fondly
kissed
it
carried
it
to
the
window
go
happy
bird
said
he
rejoice
with
the
partner
of
thy
heart
in
the
days
of
youth
and
why
should
i
make
thee
a
in
this
dreary
tower
where
love
can
never
enter
the
dove
flapped
its
wings
in
rapture
gave
one
vault
into
the
air
and
then
swooped
downward
on
whistling
wings
to
the
blooming
bowers
of
the
darro
the
prince
followed
him
with
his
eyes
and
then
gave
way
to
bitter
repining
the
singing
of
the
birds
which
once
delighted
him
now
added
to
his
bitterness
love
love
love
alas
poor
youth
he
now
understood
the
strain
his
eyes
flashed
fire
when
next
he
beheld
the
sage
bonabben
why
hast
thou
kept
me
in
this
abject
ignorance
cried
he
why
has
the
great
mystery
and
principle
of
life
been
withheld
from
me
in
which
i
find
the
meanest
insect
is
so
learned
behold
all
nature
is
in
a
revel
of
delight
every
created
being
rejoices
with
its
mate
this
this
is
the
love
about
which
i
have
sought
instruction
why
am
i
alone
debarred
its
enjoyment
why
has
so
much
of
my
youth
been
wasted
without
a
knowledge
of
its
raptures
the
sage
bonabben
saw
that
all
further
reserve
was
useless
for
the
prince
had
acquired
the
dangerous
and
forbidden
knowledge
he
revealed
to
him
therefore
the
predictions
of
the
astrologers
and
the
precautions
that
had
been
taken
in
his
education
to
avert
the
threatened
evils
and
now
my
prince
added
he
my
life
is
in
your
hands
let
the
king
your
father
discover
that
you
have
learned
the
passion
of
love
while
under
my
guardianship
and
my
head
must
answer
for
the
prince
was
as
reasonable
as
most
young
men
of
his
age
and
easily
listened
to
the
remonstrances
of
his
tutor
since
nothing
pleaded
against
them
besides
he
really
was
attached
to
eben
bonabben
and
being
as
yet
but
theoretically
acquainted
with
the
passion
of
love
he
consented
to
confine
the
knowledge
of
it
to
his
own
bosom
rather
than
endanger
the
head
of
the
philosopher
his
discretion
was
doomed
however
to
be
put
to
still
further
proofs
a
few
mornings
afterwards
as
he
was
ruminating
on
the
battlements
of
the
tower
the
dove
which
had
been
released
by
him
came
hovering
in
the
air
and
alighted
fearlessly
upon
his
shoulder
the
prince
fondled
it
to
his
heart
happy
bird
said
he
who
can
fly
as
it
were
with
the
wings
of
the
morning
to
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
where
hast
thou
been
since
we
parted
in
a
far
country
my
prince
whence
i
bring
you
tidings
in
reward
for
my
liberty
in
the
wild
compass
of
my
flight
which
extends
over
plain
and
mountain
as
i
was
soaring
in
the
air
i
beheld
below
me
a
delightful
garden
with
all
kinds
of
fruits
and
flowers
it
was
in
a
green
meadow
on
the
banks
of
a
wandering
stream
and
in
the
centre
of
the
garden
was
a
stately
palace
i
alighted
in
one
of
the
bowers
to
repose
after
my
weary
flight
on
the
green
bank
below
me
was
a
youthful
princess
in
the
very
sweetness
and
bloom
of
her
years
she
was
surrounded
by
female
attendants
young
like
herself
who
decked
her
with
garlands
and
coronets
of
flowers
but
no
flower
of
field
or
garden
could
compare
with
her
for
loveliness
here
however
she
bloomed
in
secret
for
the
garden
was
surrounded
by
high
walls
and
no
mortal
man
was
permitted
to
enter
when
i
beheld
this
beauteous
maid
thus
young
and
innocent
and
unspotted
by
the
world
i
thought
here
is
the
being
formed
by
heaven
to
inspire
my
prince
with
the
description
was
a
spark
of
fire
to
the
combustible
heart
of
ahmed
all
the
latent
amorousness
of
his
temperament
had
at
once
found
an
object
and
he
conceived
an
immeasurable
passion
for
the
princess
he
wrote
a
letter
couched
in
the
most
impassioned
language
breathing
his
fervent
devotion
but
bewailing
the
unhappy
thraldom
of
his
person
which
prevented
him
from
seeking
her
out
and
throwing
himself
at
her
feet
he
added
couplets
of
the
most
tender
and
moving
eloquence
for
he
was
a
poet
by
nature
and
inspired
by
love
he
addressed
his
letter
to
the
unknown
beauty
from
the
captive
prince
ahmed
then
perfuming
it
with
musk
and
roses
he
gave
it
to
the
dove
away
trustiest
of
messengers
said
he
fly
over
mountain
and
valley
and
river
and
plain
rest
not
in
bower
nor
set
foot
on
earth
until
thou
hast
given
this
letter
to
the
mistress
of
my
the
dove
soared
high
in
air
and
taking
his
course
darted
away
in
one
undeviating
direction
the
prince
followed
him
with
his
eye
until
he
was
a
mere
speck
on
a
cloud
and
gradually
disappeared
behind
a
mountain
day
after
day
he
watched
for
the
return
of
the
messenger
of
love
but
he
watched
in
vain
he
began
to
accuse
him
of
forgetfulness
when
towards
sunset
one
evening
the
faithful
bird
fluttered
into
his
apartment
and
falling
at
his
feet
expired
the
arrow
of
some
wanton
archer
had
pierced
his
breast
yet
he
had
struggled
with
the
lingerings
of
life
to
execute
his
mission
as
the
prince
bent
with
grief
over
this
gentle
martyr
to
fidelity
he
beheld
a
chain
of
pearls
round
his
neck
attached
to
which
beneath
his
wing
was
a
small
enamelled
picture
it
represented
a
lovely
princess
in
the
very
flower
of
her
years
it
was
doubtless
the
unknown
beauty
of
the
garden
but
who
and
where
was
she
how
had
she
received
his
letter
and
was
this
picture
sent
as
a
token
of
her
approval
of
his
passion
unfortunately
the
death
of
the
faithful
dove
left
everything
in
mystery
and
doubt
the
prince
gazed
on
the
picture
till
his
eyes
swam
with
tears
he
pressed
it
to
his
lips
and
to
his
heart
he
sat
for
hours
contemplating
it
almost
in
an
agony
of
tenderness
beautiful
image
said
he
alas
thou
art
but
an
image
yet
thy
dewy
eyes
beam
tenderly
upon
me
those
rosy
lips
look
as
though
they
would
speak
encouragement
vain
fancies
have
they
not
looked
the
same
on
some
more
happy
rival
but
where
in
this
wide
world
shall
i
hope
to
find
the
original
who
knows
what
mountains
what
realms
may
separate
us
what
adverse
chances
may
intervene
perhaps
now
even
now
lovers
may
be
crowding
around
her
while
i
sit
here
a
prisoner
in
a
tower
wasting
my
time
in
adoration
of
a
painted
the
resolution
of
prince
ahmed
was
taken
i
will
fly
from
this
palace
said
he
which
has
become
an
odious
prison
and
a
pilgrim
of
love
will
seek
this
unknown
princess
throughout
the
to
escape
from
the
tower
in
the
day
when
every
one
was
awake
might
be
a
difficult
matter
but
at
night
the
palace
was
slightly
guarded
for
no
one
apprehended
any
attempt
of
the
kind
from
the
prince
who
had
always
been
so
passive
in
his
captivity
how
was
he
to
guide
himself
however
in
his
darkling
flight
being
ignorant
of
the
country
he
bethought
him
of
the
owl
who
was
accustomed
to
roam
at
night
and
must
know
every
and
secret
pass
seeking
him
in
his
hermitage
he
questioned
him
touching
his
knowledge
of
the
land
upon
this
the
owl
put
on
a
mighty
look
you
must
know
o
prince
said
he
that
we
owls
are
of
a
very
ancient
and
extensive
family
though
rather
fallen
to
decay
and
possess
ruinous
castles
and
palaces
in
all
parts
of
spain
there
is
scarcely
a
tower
of
the
mountains
or
a
fortress
of
the
plains
or
an
old
citadel
of
a
city
but
has
some
brother
or
uncle
or
cousin
quartered
in
it
and
in
going
the
rounds
to
visit
this
my
numerous
kindred
i
have
pried
into
every
nook
and
corner
and
made
myself
acquainted
with
every
secret
of
the
the
prince
was
overjoyed
to
find
the
owl
so
deeply
versed
in
topography
and
now
informed
him
in
confidence
of
his
tender
passion
and
his
intended
elopement
urging
him
to
be
his
companion
and
counsellor
go
to
said
the
owl
with
a
look
of
displeasure
am
i
a
bird
to
engage
in
a
i
whose
whole
time
is
devoted
to
meditation
and
the
moon
be
not
offended
most
solemn
owl
replied
the
prince
abstract
thyself
for
a
time
from
meditation
and
the
moon
and
aid
me
in
my
flight
and
thou
shalt
have
whatever
heart
can
i
have
that
already
said
the
owl
a
few
mice
are
sufficient
for
my
frugal
table
and
this
hole
in
the
wall
is
spacious
enough
for
my
studies
and
what
more
does
a
philosopher
like
myself
desire
bethink
thee
most
wise
owl
that
while
moping
in
thy
cell
and
gazing
at
the
moon
all
thy
talents
are
lost
to
the
world
i
shall
one
day
be
a
sovereign
prince
and
may
advance
thee
to
some
post
of
honor
and
the
owl
though
a
philosopher
and
above
the
ordinary
wants
of
life
was
not
above
ambition
so
he
was
finally
prevailed
on
to
elope
with
the
prince
and
be
his
guide
and
mentor
in
his
pilgrimage
the
plans
of
a
lover
are
promptly
executed
the
prince
collected
all
his
jewels
and
concealed
them
about
his
person
as
travelling
funds
that
very
night
he
lowered
himself
by
his
scarf
from
a
balcony
of
the
tower
clambered
over
the
outer
walls
of
the
generalife
and
guided
by
the
owl
made
good
his
escape
before
morning
to
the
mountains
he
now
held
a
council
with
his
mentor
as
to
his
future
course
might
i
advise
said
the
owl
i
would
recommend
you
to
repair
to
seville
you
must
know
that
many
years
since
i
was
on
a
visit
to
an
uncle
an
owl
of
great
dignity
and
power
who
lived
in
a
ruined
wing
of
the
alcazar
of
that
place
in
my
hoverings
at
night
over
the
city
i
frequently
remarked
a
light
burning
in
a
lonely
tower
at
length
i
alighted
on
the
battlements
and
found
it
to
proceed
from
the
lamp
of
an
arabian
magician
he
was
surrounded
by
his
magic
books
and
on
his
shoulder
was
perched
his
familiar
an
ancient
raven
who
had
come
with
him
from
egypt
i
am
acquainted
with
that
raven
and
owe
to
him
a
great
part
of
the
knowledge
i
possess
the
magician
is
since
dead
but
the
raven
still
inhabits
the
tower
for
these
birds
are
of
wonderful
long
life
i
would
advise
you
o
prince
to
seek
that
raven
for
he
is
a
soothsayer
and
a
conjurer
and
deals
in
the
black
art
for
which
all
ravens
and
especially
those
of
egypt
are
the
prince
was
struck
with
the
wisdom
of
this
advice
and
accordingly
bent
his
course
towards
seville
he
travelled
only
in
the
night
to
accommodate
his
companion
and
lay
by
during
the
day
in
some
dark
cavern
or
mouldering
for
the
owl
knew
every
of
the
kind
and
had
a
most
antiquarian
taste
for
ruins
at
length
one
morning
at
daybreak
they
reached
the
city
of
seville
where
the
owl
who
hated
the
glare
and
bustle
of
crowded
streets
halted
without
the
gate
and
took
up
his
quarters
in
a
hollow
tree
the
prince
entered
the
gate
and
readily
found
the
magic
tower
which
rose
above
the
houses
of
the
city
as
a
rises
above
the
shrubs
of
the
desert
it
was
in
fact
the
same
tower
standing
at
the
present
day
and
known
as
the
giralda
the
famous
moorish
tower
of
seville
the
prince
ascended
by
a
great
winding
staircase
to
the
summit
of
the
tower
where
he
found
the
cabalistic
raven
an
old
mysterious
bird
ragged
in
feather
with
a
film
over
one
eye
that
gave
him
the
glare
of
a
spectre
he
was
perched
on
one
leg
with
his
head
turned
on
one
side
poring
with
his
remaining
eye
on
a
diagram
described
on
the
pavement
the
prince
approached
him
with
the
awe
and
reverence
naturally
inspired
by
his
venerable
appearance
and
supernatural
wisdom
pardon
me
most
ancient
and
darkly
wise
raven
exclaimed
he
if
for
a
moment
i
interrupt
those
studies
which
are
the
wonder
of
the
world
you
behold
before
you
a
votary
of
love
who
would
fain
seek
your
counsel
how
to
obtain
the
object
of
his
in
other
words
said
the
raven
with
a
significant
look
you
seek
to
try
my
skill
in
palmistry
come
show
me
your
hand
and
let
me
decipher
the
mysterious
lines
of
excuse
me
said
the
prince
i
come
not
to
pry
into
the
decrees
of
fate
which
are
hidden
by
allah
from
the
eyes
of
mortals
i
am
a
pilgrim
of
love
and
seek
but
to
find
a
clue
to
the
object
of
my
and
can
you
be
at
any
loss
for
an
object
in
amorous
andalusia
said
the
old
raven
leering
upon
him
with
his
single
eye
above
all
can
you
be
at
a
loss
in
wanton
seville
where
damsels
dance
the
zambra
under
every
orange
grove
the
prince
blushed
and
was
somewhat
shocked
at
hearing
an
old
bird
with
one
foot
in
the
grave
talk
thus
loosely
believe
me
said
he
gravely
i
am
on
none
such
light
and
vagrant
errand
as
thou
dost
insinuate
the
damsels
of
andalusia
who
dance
among
the
orange
groves
of
the
guadalquivir
are
as
naught
to
me
i
seek
one
unknown
but
immaculate
beauty
the
original
of
this
picture
and
i
beseech
thee
most
potent
raven
if
it
be
within
the
scope
of
thy
knowledge
or
the
reach
of
thy
art
inform
me
where
she
may
be
the
raven
was
rebuked
by
the
gravity
of
the
prince
what
know
i
replied
he
dryly
of
youth
and
beauty
my
visits
are
to
the
old
and
withered
not
the
fresh
and
fair
the
harbinger
of
fate
am
i
who
croak
bodings
of
death
from
the
and
flap
my
wings
at
the
sick
man
s
window
you
must
seek
elsewhere
for
tidings
of
your
unknown
and
where
can
i
seek
if
not
among
the
sons
of
wisdom
versed
in
the
book
of
destiny
know
that
i
am
a
royal
prince
fated
by
the
stars
and
sent
on
a
mysterious
enterprise
on
which
may
hang
the
destiny
of
when
the
raven
heard
that
it
was
a
matter
of
vast
moment
in
which
the
stars
took
interest
he
changed
his
tone
and
manner
and
listened
with
profound
attention
to
the
story
of
the
prince
when
it
was
concluded
he
replied
touching
this
princess
i
can
give
thee
no
information
of
myself
for
my
flight
is
not
among
gardens
or
around
ladies
bowers
but
hie
thee
to
cordova
seek
the
of
the
great
abderahman
which
stands
in
the
court
of
the
principal
mosque
at
the
foot
of
it
thou
wilt
find
a
great
traveller
who
has
visited
all
countries
and
courts
and
been
a
favorite
with
queens
and
princesses
he
will
give
thee
tidings
of
the
object
of
thy
many
thanks
for
this
precious
information
said
the
prince
farewell
most
venerable
farewell
pilgrim
of
love
said
the
raven
dryly
and
again
fell
to
pondering
on
the
diagram
the
prince
sallied
forth
from
seville
sought
his
the
owl
who
was
still
dozing
in
the
hollow
tree
and
set
off
for
cordova
he
approached
it
along
hanging
gardens
and
orange
and
citron
groves
overlooking
the
fair
valley
of
the
guadalquivir
when
arrived
at
its
gates
the
owl
flew
up
to
a
dark
hole
in
the
wall
and
the
prince
proceeded
in
quest
of
the
planted
in
days
of
yore
by
the
great
abderahman
it
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
great
court
of
the
mosque
towering
from
amidst
orange
and
cypress
trees
dervises
and
faquirs
were
seated
in
groups
under
the
cloisters
of
the
court
and
many
of
the
faithful
were
performing
their
ablutions
at
the
fountains
before
entering
the
mosque
at
the
foot
of
the
was
a
crowd
listening
to
the
words
of
one
who
appeared
to
be
talking
with
great
volubility
this
said
the
prince
to
himself
must
be
the
great
traveller
who
is
to
give
me
tidings
of
the
unknown
he
mingled
in
the
crowd
but
was
astonished
to
perceive
that
they
were
all
listening
to
a
parrot
who
with
his
coat
pragmatical
eye
and
consequential
had
the
air
of
a
bird
on
excellent
terms
with
himself
how
is
this
said
the
prince
to
one
of
the
bystanders
that
so
many
grave
persons
can
be
delighted
with
the
garrulity
of
a
chattering
bird
you
know
not
whom
you
speak
of
said
the
other
this
parrot
is
a
descendant
of
the
famous
parrot
of
persia
renowned
for
his
talent
he
has
all
the
learning
of
the
east
at
the
tip
of
his
tongue
and
can
quote
poetry
as
fast
as
he
can
talk
he
has
visited
various
foreign
courts
where
he
has
been
considered
an
oracle
of
erudition
he
has
been
a
universal
favorite
also
with
the
fair
sex
who
have
a
vast
admiration
for
erudite
parrots
that
can
quote
enough
said
the
prince
i
will
have
some
private
talk
with
this
distinguished
he
sought
a
private
interview
and
expounded
the
nature
of
his
errand
he
had
scarcely
mentioned
it
when
the
parrot
burst
into
a
fit
of
dry
rickety
laughter
that
absolutely
brought
tears
into
his
eyes
excuse
my
merriment
said
he
but
the
mere
mention
of
love
always
sets
me
the
prince
was
shocked
at
this
mirth
is
not
love
said
he
the
great
mystery
of
nature
the
secret
principle
of
life
the
universal
bond
of
sympathy
a
fig
s
end
cried
the
parrot
interrupting
him
prithee
where
hast
thou
learned
this
sentimental
jargon
trust
me
love
is
quite
out
of
vogue
one
never
hears
of
it
in
the
company
of
wits
and
people
of
the
prince
sighed
as
he
recalled
the
different
language
of
his
friend
the
dove
but
this
parrot
thought
he
has
lived
about
the
court
he
affects
the
wit
and
the
fine
gentleman
he
knows
nothing
of
the
thing
called
love
unwilling
to
provoke
any
more
ridicule
of
the
sentiment
which
filled
his
heart
he
now
directed
his
inquiries
to
the
immediate
purport
of
his
visit
tell
me
said
he
most
accomplished
parrot
thou
who
hast
everywhere
been
admitted
to
the
most
secret
bowers
of
beauty
hast
thou
in
the
course
of
thy
travels
met
with
the
original
of
this
portrait
the
parrot
took
the
picture
in
his
claw
turned
his
head
from
side
to
side
and
examined
it
curiously
with
either
eye
upon
my
honor
said
he
a
very
pretty
face
very
pretty
but
then
one
sees
so
many
pretty
women
in
one
s
travels
that
one
can
hardly
but
hold
bless
me
now
i
look
at
it
again
sure
enough
this
is
the
princess
aldegonda
how
could
i
forget
one
that
is
so
prodigious
a
favorite
with
me
the
princess
aldegonda
echoed
the
prince
and
where
is
she
to
be
found
softly
softly
said
the
parrot
easier
to
be
found
than
gained
she
is
the
only
daughter
of
the
christian
king
who
reigns
at
toledo
and
is
shut
up
from
the
world
until
her
seventeenth
birthday
on
account
of
some
prediction
of
those
meddlesome
fellows
the
astrologers
you
ll
not
get
a
sight
of
her
no
mortal
man
can
see
her
i
was
admitted
to
her
presence
to
entertain
her
and
i
assure
you
on
the
word
of
a
parrot
who
has
seen
the
world
i
have
conversed
with
much
sillier
princesses
in
my
a
word
in
confidence
my
dear
parrot
said
the
prince
i
am
heir
to
a
kingdom
and
shall
one
day
sit
upon
a
throne
i
see
that
you
are
a
bird
of
parts
and
understand
the
world
help
me
to
gain
possession
of
this
princess
and
i
will
advance
you
to
some
distinguished
place
about
with
all
my
heart
said
the
parrot
but
let
it
be
a
sinecure
if
possible
for
we
wits
have
a
great
dislike
to
arrangements
were
promptly
made
the
prince
sallied
forth
from
cordova
through
the
same
gate
by
which
he
had
entered
called
the
owl
down
from
the
hole
in
the
wall
introduced
him
to
his
new
travelling
companion
as
a
brother
savant
and
away
they
set
off
on
their
journey
they
travelled
much
more
slowly
than
accorded
with
the
impatience
of
the
prince
but
the
parrot
was
accustomed
to
high
life
and
did
not
like
to
be
disturbed
early
in
the
morning
the
owl
on
the
other
hand
was
for
sleeping
at
and
lost
a
great
deal
of
time
by
his
long
siestas
his
antiquarian
taste
also
was
in
the
way
for
he
insisted
on
pausing
and
inspecting
every
ruin
and
had
long
legendary
tales
to
tell
about
every
old
tower
and
castle
in
the
country
the
prince
had
supposed
that
he
and
the
parrot
being
both
birds
of
learning
would
delight
in
each
other
s
society
but
never
had
he
been
more
mistaken
they
were
eternally
bickering
the
one
was
a
wit
the
other
a
philosopher
the
parrot
quoted
poetry
was
critical
on
new
readings
and
eloquent
on
small
points
of
erudition
the
owl
treated
all
such
knowledge
as
trifling
and
relished
nothing
but
metaphysics
then
the
parrot
would
sing
songs
and
repeat
and
crack
jokes
upon
his
solemn
neighbor
and
laugh
outrageously
at
his
own
wit
all
which
proceedings
the
owl
considered
as
a
grievous
invasion
of
his
dignity
and
would
scowl
and
sulk
and
swell
and
be
silent
for
a
whole
day
together
the
prince
heeded
not
the
wranglings
of
his
companions
being
wrapped
up
in
the
dreams
of
his
own
fancy
and
the
contemplation
of
the
portrait
of
the
beautiful
princess
in
this
way
they
journeyed
through
the
stern
passes
of
the
sierra
morena
across
the
sunburnt
plains
of
la
mancha
and
castile
and
along
the
banks
of
the
golden
tagus
which
winds
its
wizard
mazes
over
one
half
of
spain
and
portugal
at
length
they
came
in
sight
of
a
strong
city
with
walls
and
towers
built
on
a
rocky
promontory
round
the
foot
of
which
the
tagus
circled
with
brawling
violence
behold
exclaimed
the
owl
the
ancient
and
renowned
city
of
toledo
a
city
famous
for
its
antiquities
behold
those
venerable
domes
and
towers
hoary
with
time
and
clothed
with
legendary
grandeur
in
which
so
many
of
my
ancestors
have
pish
cried
the
parrot
interrupting
his
solemn
antiquarian
rapture
what
have
we
to
do
with
antiquities
and
legends
and
your
ancestry
behold
what
is
more
to
the
purpose
behold
the
abode
of
youth
and
beauty
behold
at
length
o
prince
the
abode
of
your
the
prince
looked
in
the
direction
indicated
by
the
parrot
and
beheld
in
a
delightful
green
meadow
on
the
banks
of
the
tagus
a
stately
palace
rising
from
amidst
the
bowers
of
a
delicious
garden
it
was
just
such
a
place
as
had
been
described
by
the
dove
as
the
residence
of
the
original
of
the
picture
he
gazed
at
it
with
a
throbbing
heart
perhaps
at
this
moment
thought
he
the
beautiful
princess
is
sporting
beneath
those
shady
bowers
or
pacing
with
delicate
step
those
stately
terraces
or
reposing
beneath
those
lofty
roofs
as
he
looked
more
narrowly
he
perceived
that
the
walls
of
the
garden
were
of
great
height
so
as
to
defy
access
while
numbers
of
armed
guards
patrolled
around
them
the
prince
turned
to
the
parrot
o
most
accomplished
of
birds
said
he
thou
hast
the
gift
of
human
speech
hie
thee
to
yon
garden
seek
the
idol
of
my
soul
and
tell
her
that
prince
ahmed
a
pilgrim
of
love
and
guided
by
the
stars
has
arrived
in
quest
of
her
on
the
flowery
banks
of
the
the
parrot
proud
of
his
embassy
flew
away
to
the
garden
mounted
above
its
lofty
walls
and
after
soaring
for
a
time
over
the
lawns
and
groves
alighted
on
the
balcony
of
a
pavilion
that
overhung
the
river
here
looking
in
at
the
casement
he
beheld
the
princess
reclining
on
a
couch
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
a
paper
while
tears
gently
stole
after
each
other
down
her
pallid
cheek
pluming
his
wings
for
a
moment
adjusting
his
coat
and
elevating
his
the
parrot
perched
himself
beside
her
with
a
gallant
air
then
assuming
a
tenderness
of
tone
dry
thy
tears
most
beautiful
of
princesses
said
he
i
come
to
bring
solace
to
thy
the
princess
was
startled
on
hearing
a
voice
but
turning
and
seeing
nothing
but
a
little
bird
bobbing
and
bowing
before
her
alas
what
solace
canst
thou
yield
said
she
seeing
thou
art
but
a
parrot
the
parrot
was
nettled
at
the
question
i
have
consoled
many
beautiful
ladies
in
my
time
said
he
but
let
that
pass
at
present
i
come
ambassador
from
a
royal
prince
know
that
ahmed
the
prince
of
granada
has
arrived
in
quest
of
thee
and
is
encamped
even
now
on
the
flowery
banks
of
the
the
eyes
of
the
beautiful
princess
sparkled
at
these
words
even
brighter
than
the
diamonds
in
her
coronet
o
sweetest
of
parrots
cried
she
joyful
indeed
are
thy
tidings
for
i
was
faint
and
weary
and
sick
almost
unto
death
with
doubt
of
the
constancy
of
ahmed
hie
thee
back
and
tell
him
that
the
words
of
his
letter
are
engraven
in
my
heart
and
his
poetry
has
been
the
food
of
my
soul
tell
him
however
that
he
must
prepare
to
prove
his
love
by
force
of
arms
is
my
seventeenth
birthday
when
the
king
my
father
holds
a
great
tournament
several
princes
are
to
enter
the
lists
and
my
hand
is
to
be
the
prize
of
the
the
parrot
again
took
wing
and
rustling
through
the
groves
flew
back
to
where
the
prince
awaited
his
return
the
rapture
of
ahmed
on
finding
the
original
of
his
adored
portrait
and
finding
her
kind
and
true
can
only
be
conceived
by
those
favored
mortals
who
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
realize
and
turn
a
shadow
into
substance
still
there
was
one
thing
that
alloyed
his
transport
this
impending
tournament
in
fact
the
banks
of
the
tagus
were
already
glittering
with
arms
and
resounding
with
trumpets
of
the
various
knights
who
with
proud
retinues
were
prancing
on
towards
toledo
to
attend
the
ceremonial
the
same
star
that
had
controlled
the
destiny
of
the
prince
had
governed
that
of
the
princess
and
until
her
seventeenth
birthday
she
had
been
shut
up
from
the
world
to
guard
her
from
the
tender
passion
the
fame
of
her
charms
however
had
been
enhanced
rather
than
obscured
by
this
seclusion
several
powerful
princes
had
contended
for
her
hand
and
her
father
who
was
a
king
of
wondrous
shrewdness
to
avoid
making
enemies
by
showing
partiality
had
referred
them
to
the
arbitrament
of
arms
among
the
rival
candidates
were
several
renowned
for
strength
and
prowess
what
a
predicament
for
the
unfortunate
ahmed
unprovided
as
he
was
with
weapons
and
unskilled
in
the
exercise
of
chivalry
luckless
prince
that
i
am
said
he
to
have
been
brought
up
in
seclusion
under
the
eye
of
a
philosopher
of
what
avail
are
algebra
and
philosophy
in
affairs
of
love
alas
eben
bonabben
why
hast
thou
neglected
to
instruct
me
in
the
management
of
arms
upon
this
the
owl
broke
silence
preluding
his
harangue
with
a
pious
ejaculation
for
he
was
a
devout
mussulman
allah
akbar
god
is
great
exclaimed
he
in
his
hands
are
all
secret
things
he
alone
governs
the
destiny
of
princes
know
o
prince
that
this
land
is
full
of
mysteries
hidden
from
all
but
those
who
like
myself
can
grope
after
knowledge
in
the
dark
know
that
in
the
neighboring
mountains
there
is
a
cave
and
in
that
cave
there
is
an
iron
table
and
on
that
table
there
lies
a
suit
of
magic
armor
and
beside
that
table
there
stands
a
steed
which
have
been
shut
up
there
for
many
the
prince
stared
with
wonder
while
the
owl
blinking
his
huge
round
eyes
and
erecting
his
horns
proceeded
many
years
since
i
accompanied
my
father
to
these
parts
on
a
tour
of
his
estates
and
we
sojourned
in
that
cave
and
thus
became
i
acquainted
with
the
mystery
it
is
a
tradition
in
our
family
which
i
have
heard
from
my
grandfather
when
i
was
yet
but
a
very
little
owlet
that
this
armor
belonged
to
a
moorish
magician
who
took
refuge
in
this
cavern
when
toledo
was
captured
by
the
christians
and
died
here
leaving
his
steed
and
weapons
under
a
mystic
spell
never
to
be
used
but
by
a
moslem
and
by
him
only
from
sunrise
to
in
that
interval
whoever
uses
them
will
overthrow
every
enough
let
us
seek
this
cave
exclaimed
ahmed
guided
by
his
legendary
mentor
the
prince
found
the
cavern
which
was
in
one
of
the
wildest
recesses
of
those
rocky
cliffs
which
rise
around
toledo
none
but
the
mousing
eye
of
an
owl
or
an
antiquary
could
have
discovered
the
entrance
to
it
a
sepulchral
lamp
of
everlasting
oil
shed
a
solemn
light
through
the
place
on
an
iron
table
in
the
centre
of
the
cavern
lay
the
magic
armor
against
it
leaned
the
lance
and
beside
it
stood
an
arabian
steed
caparisoned
for
the
field
but
motionless
as
a
statue
the
armor
was
bright
and
unsullied
as
it
had
gleamed
in
days
of
old
the
steed
in
as
good
condition
as
if
just
from
the
pasture
and
when
ahmed
laid
his
hand
upon
his
neck
he
pawed
the
ground
and
gave
a
loud
neigh
of
joy
that
shook
the
walls
of
the
cavern
thus
amply
provided
with
horse
and
rider
and
weapon
to
wear
the
prince
determined
to
defy
the
field
in
the
impending
tourney
the
eventful
morning
arrived
the
lists
for
the
combat
were
prepared
in
the
vega
or
plain
just
below
the
walls
of
toledo
where
stages
and
galleries
were
erected
for
the
spectators
covered
with
rich
tapestry
and
sheltered
from
the
sun
by
silken
awnings
all
the
beauties
of
the
land
were
assembled
in
those
galleries
while
below
pranced
plumed
knights
with
their
pages
and
esquires
among
whom
figured
conspicuously
the
princes
who
were
to
contend
in
the
tourney
all
the
beauties
of
the
land
however
were
eclipsed
when
the
princess
aldegonda
appeared
in
the
royal
pavilion
and
for
the
first
time
broke
forth
upon
the
gaze
of
an
admiring
world
a
murmur
of
wonder
ran
through
the
crowd
at
her
transcendent
loveliness
and
the
princes
who
were
candidates
for
her
hand
merely
on
the
faith
of
her
reported
charms
now
felt
tenfold
ardor
for
the
conflict
the
princess
however
had
a
troubled
look
the
color
came
and
went
from
her
cheek
and
her
eye
wandered
with
a
restless
and
unsatisfied
expression
over
the
plumed
throng
of
knights
the
trumpets
were
about
sounding
for
the
encounter
when
the
herald
announced
the
arrival
of
a
strange
knight
and
ahmed
rode
into
the
field
a
steel
helmet
studded
with
gems
rose
above
his
turban
his
cuirass
was
embossed
with
gold
his
cimeter
and
dagger
were
of
the
workmanship
of
fez
and
flamed
with
precious
stones
a
round
shield
was
at
his
shoulder
and
in
his
hand
he
bore
the
lance
of
charmed
virtue
the
caparison
of
his
arabian
steed
was
richly
embroidered
and
swept
the
ground
and
the
proud
animal
pranced
and
snuffed
the
air
and
neighed
with
joy
at
once
more
beholding
the
array
of
arms
the
lofty
and
graceful
demeanor
of
the
prince
struck
every
eye
and
when
his
appellation
was
announced
the
pilgrim
of
love
a
universal
flutter
and
agitation
prevailed
among
the
fair
dames
in
the
galleries
when
ahmed
presented
himself
at
the
lists
however
they
were
closed
against
him
none
but
princes
he
was
told
were
admitted
to
the
contest
he
declared
his
name
and
rank
still
worse
he
was
a
moslem
and
could
not
engage
in
a
tourney
where
the
hand
of
a
christian
princess
was
the
prize
the
rival
princes
surrounded
him
with
haughty
and
menacing
aspects
and
one
of
insolent
demeanor
and
herculean
frame
sneered
at
his
light
and
youthful
form
and
scoffed
at
his
amorous
appellation
the
ire
of
the
prince
was
roused
he
defied
his
rival
to
the
encounter
they
took
distance
wheeled
and
charged
and
at
the
first
touch
of
the
magic
lance
the
brawny
scoffer
was
tilted
from
his
saddle
here
the
prince
would
have
paused
but
alas
he
had
to
deal
with
a
demoniac
horse
and
armor
once
in
action
nothing
could
control
them
the
arabian
steed
charged
into
the
thickest
of
the
throng
the
lance
overturned
everything
that
presented
the
gentle
prince
was
carried
about
the
field
strewing
it
with
high
and
low
gentle
and
simple
and
grieving
at
his
own
involuntary
exploits
the
king
stormed
and
raged
at
this
outrage
on
his
subjects
and
his
guests
he
ordered
out
all
his
guards
they
were
unhorsed
as
fast
as
they
came
up
the
king
threw
off
his
robes
grasped
buckler
and
lance
and
rode
forth
to
awe
the
stranger
with
the
presence
of
majesty
itself
alas
majesty
fared
no
better
than
the
vulgar
the
steed
and
lance
were
no
respecters
of
persons
to
the
dismay
of
ahmed
he
was
borne
full
tilt
against
the
king
and
in
a
moment
the
royal
heels
were
in
the
air
and
the
crown
was
rolling
in
the
dust
at
this
moment
the
sun
reached
the
meridian
the
magic
spell
resumed
its
power
the
arabian
steed
scoured
across
the
plain
leaped
the
barrier
plunged
into
the
tagus
swam
its
raging
current
bore
the
prince
breathless
and
amazed
to
the
cavern
and
resumed
his
station
like
a
statue
beside
the
iron
table
the
prince
dismounted
right
gladly
and
replaced
the
armor
to
abide
the
further
decrees
of
fate
then
seating
himself
in
the
cavern
he
ruminated
on
the
desperate
state
to
which
this
demoniac
steed
and
armor
had
reduced
him
never
should
he
dare
to
show
his
face
at
toledo
after
inflicting
such
disgrace
upon
its
chivalry
and
such
an
outrage
on
its
king
what
too
would
the
princess
think
of
so
rude
and
riotous
an
achievement
full
of
anxiety
he
sent
forth
his
winged
messengers
to
gather
tidings
the
parrot
resorted
to
all
the
public
places
and
crowded
resorts
of
the
city
and
soon
returned
with
a
world
of
gossip
all
toledo
was
in
consternation
the
princess
had
been
borne
off
senseless
to
the
palace
the
tournament
had
ended
in
confusion
every
one
was
talking
of
the
sudden
apparition
prodigious
exploits
and
strange
disappearance
of
the
moslem
knight
some
pronounced
him
a
moorish
magician
others
thought
him
a
demon
who
had
assumed
a
human
shape
while
others
related
traditions
of
enchanted
warriors
hidden
in
the
caves
of
the
mountains
and
thought
it
might
be
one
of
these
who
had
made
a
sudden
irruption
from
his
den
all
agreed
that
no
mere
ordinary
mortal
could
have
wrought
such
wonders
or
unhorsed
such
accomplished
and
stalwart
christian
warriors
the
owl
flew
forth
at
night
and
hovered
about
the
dusky
city
perching
on
the
roofs
and
chimneys
he
then
wheeled
his
flight
up
to
the
royal
palace
which
stood
on
a
rocky
summit
of
toledo
and
went
prowling
about
its
terraces
and
battlements
eavesdropping
at
every
cranny
and
glaring
in
with
his
big
goggling
eyes
at
every
window
where
there
was
a
light
so
as
to
throw
two
or
three
maids
of
honor
into
fits
it
was
not
until
the
gray
dawn
began
to
peer
above
the
mountains
that
he
returned
from
his
mousing
expedition
and
related
to
the
prince
what
he
had
seen
as
i
was
prying
about
one
of
the
loftiest
towers
of
the
palace
said
he
i
beheld
through
a
casement
a
beautiful
princess
she
was
reclining
on
a
couch
with
attendants
and
physicians
around
her
but
she
would
none
of
their
ministry
and
relief
when
they
retired
i
beheld
her
draw
forth
a
letter
from
her
bosom
and
read
and
kiss
it
and
give
way
to
loud
lamentations
at
which
philosopher
as
i
am
i
could
but
be
greatly
the
tender
heart
of
ahmed
was
distressed
at
these
tidings
too
true
were
thy
words
o
sage
eben
bonabben
cried
he
care
and
sorrow
and
sleepless
nights
are
the
lot
of
lovers
allah
preserve
the
princess
from
the
blighting
influence
of
this
thing
called
love
further
intelligence
from
toledo
corroborated
the
report
of
the
owl
the
city
was
a
prey
to
uneasiness
and
alarm
the
princess
was
conveyed
to
the
highest
tower
of
the
palace
every
avenue
to
which
was
strongly
guarded
in
the
mean
time
a
devouring
melancholy
had
seized
upon
her
of
which
no
one
could
divine
the
cause
she
refused
food
and
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
every
consolation
the
most
skilful
physicians
had
essayed
their
art
in
vain
it
was
thought
some
magic
spell
had
been
practised
upon
her
and
the
king
made
proclamation
declaring
that
whoever
should
effect
her
cure
should
receive
the
richest
jewel
in
the
royal
treasury
when
the
owl
who
was
dozing
in
a
corner
heard
of
this
proclamation
he
rolled
his
large
eyes
and
looked
more
mysterious
than
ever
allah
akbar
exclaimed
he
happy
the
man
that
shall
effect
that
cure
should
he
but
know
what
to
choose
from
the
royal
what
mean
you
most
reverend
owl
said
ahmed
hearken
o
prince
to
what
i
shall
relate
we
owls
you
must
know
are
a
learned
body
and
much
given
to
dark
and
dusty
research
during
my
late
prowling
at
night
about
the
domes
and
turrets
of
toledo
i
discovered
a
college
of
antiquarian
owls
who
hold
their
meetings
in
a
great
vaulted
tower
where
the
royal
treasury
is
deposited
here
they
were
discussing
the
forms
and
inscriptions
and
designs
of
ancient
gems
and
jewels
and
of
golden
and
silver
vessels
heaped
up
in
the
treasury
the
fashion
of
every
country
and
age
but
mostly
they
were
interested
about
certain
relics
and
talismans
that
have
remained
in
the
treasury
since
the
time
of
roderick
the
goth
among
these
was
a
box
of
secured
by
bands
of
steel
of
oriental
workmanship
and
inscribed
with
mystic
characters
known
only
to
the
learned
few
this
box
and
its
inscription
had
occupied
the
college
for
several
sessions
and
had
caused
much
long
and
grave
dispute
at
the
time
of
my
visit
a
very
ancient
owl
who
had
recently
arrived
from
egypt
was
seated
on
the
lid
of
the
box
lecturing
upon
the
inscription
and
he
proved
from
it
that
the
coffer
contained
the
silken
carpet
of
the
throne
of
solomon
the
wise
which
doubtless
had
been
brought
to
toledo
by
the
jews
who
took
refuge
there
after
the
downfall
of
when
the
owl
had
concluded
his
antiquarian
harangue
the
prince
remained
for
a
time
absorbed
in
thought
i
have
heard
said
he
from
the
sage
eben
bonabben
of
the
wonderful
properties
of
that
talisman
which
disappeared
at
the
fall
of
jerusalem
and
was
supposed
to
be
lost
to
mankind
doubtless
it
remains
a
sealed
mystery
to
the
christians
of
toledo
if
i
can
get
possession
of
that
carpet
my
fortune
is
the
next
day
the
prince
laid
aside
his
rich
attire
and
arrayed
himself
in
the
simple
garb
of
an
arab
of
the
desert
he
dyed
his
complexion
to
a
tawny
hue
and
no
one
could
have
recognized
in
him
the
splendid
warrior
who
had
caused
such
admiration
and
dismay
at
the
tournament
with
staff
in
hand
and
scrip
by
his
side
and
a
small
pastoral
reed
he
repaired
to
toledo
and
presenting
himself
at
the
gate
of
the
royal
palace
announced
himself
as
a
candidate
for
the
reward
offered
for
the
cure
of
the
princess
the
guards
would
have
driven
him
away
with
blows
what
can
a
vagrant
arab
like
thyself
pretend
to
do
said
they
in
a
case
where
the
most
learned
of
the
land
have
failed
the
king
however
overheard
the
tumult
and
ordered
the
arab
to
be
brought
into
his
presence
most
potent
king
said
ahmed
you
behold
before
you
a
bedouin
arab
the
greater
part
of
whose
life
has
been
passed
in
the
solitudes
of
the
desert
these
solitudes
it
is
well
known
are
the
haunts
of
demons
and
evil
spirits
who
beset
us
poor
shepherds
in
our
lonely
watchings
enter
into
and
possess
our
flocks
and
herds
and
sometimes
render
even
the
patient
camel
furious
against
these
our
is
music
and
we
have
legendary
airs
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
that
we
chant
and
pipe
to
cast
forth
these
evil
spirits
i
am
of
a
gifted
line
and
possess
this
power
in
its
fullest
force
if
it
be
any
evil
influence
of
the
kind
that
holds
a
spell
over
thy
daughter
i
pledge
my
head
to
free
her
from
its
the
king
who
was
a
man
of
understanding
and
knew
the
wonderful
secrets
possessed
by
the
arabs
was
inspired
with
hope
by
the
confident
language
of
the
prince
he
conducted
him
immediately
to
the
lofty
tower
secured
by
several
doors
in
the
summit
of
which
was
the
chamber
of
the
princess
the
windows
opened
upon
a
terrace
with
balustrades
commanding
a
view
over
toledo
and
all
the
surrounding
country
the
windows
were
darkened
for
the
princess
lay
within
a
prey
to
a
devouring
grief
that
refused
all
alleviation
the
prince
seated
himself
on
the
terrace
and
performed
several
wild
arabian
airs
on
his
pastoral
pipe
which
he
had
learnt
from
his
attendants
in
the
generalife
at
granada
the
princess
continued
insensible
and
the
doctors
who
were
present
shook
their
heads
and
smiled
with
incredulity
and
contempt
at
length
the
prince
laid
aside
the
reed
and
to
a
simple
melody
chanted
the
amatory
verses
of
the
letter
which
had
declared
his
passion
the
princess
recognized
the
strain
a
fluttering
joy
stole
to
her
heart
she
raised
her
head
and
listened
tears
rushed
to
her
eyes
and
streamed
down
her
cheeks
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
with
a
tumult
of
emotions
she
would
have
asked
for
the
minstrel
to
be
brought
into
her
presence
but
maiden
coyness
held
her
silent
the
king
read
her
wishes
and
at
his
command
ahmed
was
conducted
into
the
chamber
the
lovers
were
discreet
they
but
exchanged
glances
yet
those
glances
spoke
volumes
never
was
triumph
of
music
more
complete
the
rose
had
returned
to
the
soft
cheek
of
the
princess
the
freshness
to
her
lip
and
the
dewy
light
to
her
languishing
eyes
all
the
physicians
present
stared
at
each
other
with
astonishment
the
king
regarded
the
arab
minstrel
with
admiration
mixed
with
awe
wonderful
youth
exclaimed
he
thou
shalt
henceforth
be
the
first
physician
of
my
court
and
no
other
prescription
will
i
take
but
thy
melody
for
the
present
receive
thy
reward
the
most
precious
jewel
in
my
o
king
replied
ahmed
i
care
not
for
silver
or
gold
or
precious
stones
one
relic
hast
thou
in
thy
treasury
handed
down
from
the
moslems
who
once
owned
toledo
a
box
of
containing
a
silken
carpet
give
me
that
box
and
i
am
all
present
were
surprised
at
the
moderation
of
the
arab
and
still
more
when
the
box
of
was
brought
and
the
carpet
drawn
forth
it
was
of
fine
green
silk
covered
with
hebrew
and
chaldaic
characters
the
court
physicians
looked
at
each
other
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
smiled
at
the
simplicity
of
this
new
practitioner
who
could
be
content
with
so
paltry
a
fee
this
carpet
said
the
prince
once
covered
the
throne
of
solomon
the
wise
it
is
worthy
of
being
placed
beneath
the
feet
of
so
saying
he
spread
it
on
the
terrace
beneath
an
ottoman
that
had
been
brought
forth
for
the
princess
then
seating
himself
at
her
feet
who
said
he
shall
counteract
what
is
written
in
the
book
of
fate
behold
the
prediction
of
the
astrologers
verified
know
o
king
that
your
daughter
and
i
have
long
loved
each
other
in
secret
behold
in
me
the
pilgrim
of
love
these
words
were
scarcely
from
his
lips
when
the
carpet
rose
in
the
air
bearing
off
the
prince
and
princess
the
king
and
the
physicians
gazed
after
it
with
open
mouths
and
straining
eyes
until
it
became
a
little
speck
on
the
white
bosom
of
a
cloud
and
then
disappeared
in
the
blue
vault
of
heaven
the
king
in
a
rage
summoned
his
treasurer
how
is
this
said
he
that
thou
hast
suffered
an
infidel
to
get
possession
of
such
a
talisman
alas
sir
we
knew
not
its
nature
nor
could
we
decipher
the
inscription
of
the
box
if
it
be
indeed
the
carpet
of
the
throne
of
the
wise
solomon
it
is
possessed
of
magic
power
and
can
transport
its
owner
from
place
to
place
through
the
the
king
assembled
a
mighty
army
and
set
off
for
granada
in
pursuit
of
the
fugitives
his
march
was
long
and
toilsome
encamping
in
the
vega
he
sent
a
herald
to
demand
restitution
of
his
daughter
the
king
himself
came
forth
with
all
his
court
to
meet
him
in
the
king
he
beheld
the
real
minstrel
for
ahmed
had
succeeded
to
the
throne
on
the
death
of
his
father
and
the
beautiful
aldegonda
was
his
sultana
the
christian
king
was
easily
pacified
when
he
found
that
his
daughter
was
suffered
to
continue
in
her
faith
not
that
he
was
particularly
pious
but
religion
is
always
a
point
of
pride
and
etiquette
with
princes
instead
of
bloody
battles
there
was
a
succession
of
feasts
and
rejoicings
after
which
the
king
returned
well
pleased
to
toledo
and
the
youthful
couple
continued
to
reign
as
happily
as
wisely
in
the
alhambra
it
is
proper
to
add
that
the
owl
and
the
parrot
had
severally
followed
the
prince
by
easy
stages
to
granada
the
former
travelling
by
night
and
stopping
at
the
various
hereditary
possessions
of
his
family
the
latter
figuring
in
gay
circles
of
every
town
and
city
on
his
route
ahmed
gratefully
requited
the
services
which
they
had
rendered
on
his
pilgrimage
he
appointed
the
owl
his
prime
minister
the
parrot
his
master
of
ceremonies
it
is
needless
to
say
that
never
was
a
realm
more
sagely
administered
nor
a
court
conducted
with
more
exact
punctilio
a
ramble
among
the
hills
i
used
frequently
to
amuse
myself
towards
the
close
of
the
day
when
the
heat
had
subsided
with
taking
long
rambles
about
the
neighboring
hills
and
the
deep
umbrageous
valleys
accompanied
by
my
historiographic
squire
mateo
to
whose
passion
for
gossiping
i
on
such
occasions
gave
the
most
unbounded
license
and
there
was
scarce
a
rock
or
ruin
or
broken
fountain
or
lonely
glen
about
which
he
had
not
some
marvellous
story
or
above
all
some
golden
legend
for
never
was
poor
devil
so
munificent
in
dispensing
hidden
treasures
in
the
course
of
one
of
these
strolls
mateo
was
more
than
usually
communicative
it
was
toward
sunset
that
we
sallied
forth
from
the
great
gate
of
justice
and
ascended
an
alley
of
trees
until
we
came
to
a
clump
of
figs
and
pomegranates
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
of
the
seven
floors
de
los
siete
suelos
the
identical
tower
whence
boabdil
is
said
to
have
issued
when
he
surrendered
his
capital
here
pointing
to
a
low
archway
in
the
foundation
mateo
informed
me
of
a
monstrous
sprite
or
hobgoblin
said
to
infest
this
tower
ever
since
the
time
of
the
moors
and
to
guard
the
treasures
of
a
moslem
king
sometimes
it
issues
forth
in
the
dead
of
the
night
and
scours
the
avenues
of
the
alhambra
and
the
streets
of
granada
in
the
shape
of
a
headless
horse
pursued
by
six
dogs
with
terrible
yells
and
howlings
but
have
you
ever
met
with
it
yourself
mateo
in
any
of
your
rambles
demanded
i
no
señor
god
be
thanked
but
my
grandfather
the
tailor
knew
several
persons
that
had
seen
it
for
it
went
about
much
oftener
in
his
time
than
at
present
sometimes
in
one
shape
sometimes
in
another
everybody
in
granada
has
heard
of
the
belludo
for
the
old
women
and
the
nurses
frighten
the
children
with
it
when
they
cry
some
say
it
is
the
spirit
of
a
cruel
moorish
king
who
killed
his
six
sons
and
buried
them
in
these
vaults
and
that
they
hunt
him
at
nights
in
i
forbear
to
dwell
upon
the
marvellous
details
given
by
the
mateo
about
this
redoubtable
phantom
which
has
in
fact
been
time
out
of
mind
a
favorite
theme
of
nursery
tales
and
popular
tradition
in
granada
and
of
which
honorable
mention
is
made
by
an
ancient
and
learned
historian
and
topographer
of
the
place
leaving
this
eventful
pile
we
continued
our
course
skirting
the
fruitful
orchards
of
the
generalife
in
which
two
or
three
nightingales
were
pouring
forth
a
rich
strain
of
melody
behind
these
orchards
we
passed
a
number
of
moorish
tanks
with
a
door
cut
into
the
rocky
bosom
of
the
hill
but
closed
up
these
tanks
mateo
informed
me
were
favorite
of
himself
and
his
comrades
in
boyhood
until
frightened
away
by
a
story
of
a
hideous
moor
who
used
to
issue
forth
from
the
door
in
the
rock
to
entrap
unwary
bathers
leaving
these
haunted
tanks
behind
us
we
pursued
our
ramble
up
a
solitary
winding
among
the
hills
and
soon
found
ourselves
amidst
wild
and
melancholy
mountains
destitute
of
trees
and
here
and
there
tinted
with
scanty
verdure
everything
within
sight
was
severe
and
sterile
and
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
realize
the
idea
that
but
a
short
distance
behind
us
was
the
generalife
with
its
blooming
orchards
and
terraced
gardens
and
that
we
were
in
the
vicinity
of
delicious
granada
that
city
of
groves
and
fountains
but
such
is
the
nature
of
spain
wild
and
stern
the
moment
it
escapes
from
cultivation
the
desert
and
the
garden
are
ever
side
by
side
the
narrow
defile
up
which
we
were
passing
is
called
according
to
mateo
barranco
de
la
or
the
ravine
of
the
jar
because
a
jar
full
of
moorish
gold
was
found
here
in
old
times
the
brain
of
poor
mateo
was
continually
running
upon
these
golden
legends
but
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
cross
i
see
yonder
upon
a
heap
of
stones
in
that
narrow
part
of
the
ravine
oh
that
s
nothing
a
muleteer
was
murdered
there
some
years
so
then
mateo
you
have
robbers
and
murderers
even
at
the
gates
of
the
alhambra
not
at
present
señor
that
was
formerly
when
there
used
to
be
many
loose
fellows
about
the
fortress
but
they
ve
all
been
weeded
out
not
but
that
the
gypsies
who
live
in
caves
in
the
just
out
of
the
fortress
are
many
of
them
fit
for
anything
but
we
have
had
no
murder
about
here
for
a
long
time
past
the
man
who
murdered
the
muleteer
was
hanged
in
the
our
path
continued
up
the
barranco
with
a
bold
rugged
height
to
our
left
called
the
silla
del
moro
or
chair
of
the
moor
from
the
tradition
already
alluded
to
that
the
unfortunate
boabdil
fled
thither
during
a
popular
insurrection
and
remained
all
day
seated
on
the
rocky
summit
looking
mournfully
down
on
his
factious
city
we
at
length
arrived
on
the
highest
part
of
the
promontory
above
granada
called
the
mountain
of
the
sun
the
evening
was
approaching
the
setting
sun
just
gilded
the
loftiest
heights
here
and
there
a
solitary
shepherd
might
be
descried
driving
his
flock
down
the
declivities
to
be
folded
for
the
night
or
a
muleteer
and
his
lagging
animals
threading
some
mountain
path
to
arrive
at
the
city
gates
before
nightfall
presently
the
deep
tones
of
the
cathedral
bell
came
swelling
up
the
defiles
proclaiming
the
hour
of
oration
or
prayer
the
note
was
responded
to
from
the
belfry
of
every
church
and
from
the
sweet
bells
of
the
convents
among
the
mountains
the
shepherd
paused
on
the
fold
of
the
hill
the
muleteer
in
the
midst
of
the
road
each
took
off
his
hat
and
remained
motionless
for
a
time
murmuring
his
evening
prayer
there
is
always
something
pleasingly
solemn
in
this
custom
by
which
at
a
melodious
signal
every
human
being
throughout
the
land
unites
at
the
same
moment
in
a
tribute
of
thanks
to
god
for
the
mercies
of
the
day
it
spreads
a
transient
sanctity
over
the
land
and
the
sight
of
the
sun
sinking
in
all
his
glory
adds
not
a
little
to
the
solemnity
of
the
scene
in
the
present
instance
the
effect
was
heightened
by
the
wild
and
lonely
nature
of
the
place
we
were
on
the
naked
and
broken
summit
of
the
haunted
mountain
of
the
sun
where
ruined
tanks
and
cisterns
and
the
mouldering
foundations
of
extensive
buildings
spoke
of
former
populousness
but
where
all
was
now
silent
and
desolate
as
we
were
wandering
about
among
these
traces
of
old
times
we
came
to
a
circular
pit
penetrating
deep
into
the
bosom
of
the
mountain
which
mateo
pointed
out
as
one
of
the
wonders
and
mysteries
of
the
place
i
supposed
it
to
be
a
well
dug
by
the
indefatigable
moors
to
obtain
their
favorite
element
in
its
greatest
purity
mateo
however
had
a
different
story
and
one
much
more
to
his
humor
according
to
a
tradition
in
which
his
father
and
grandfather
firmly
believed
this
was
an
entrance
to
the
subterranean
caverns
of
the
mountain
in
which
boabdil
and
his
court
lay
bound
in
magic
spell
and
whence
they
sallied
forth
at
night
at
allotted
times
to
revisit
their
ancient
abodes
ah
señor
this
mountain
is
full
of
wonders
of
the
kind
in
another
place
there
was
a
hole
somewhat
like
this
and
just
within
it
hung
an
iron
pot
by
a
chain
nobody
knew
what
was
in
that
pot
for
it
was
always
covered
up
but
everybody
supposed
it
full
of
moorish
gold
many
tried
to
draw
it
forth
for
it
seemed
just
within
reach
but
the
moment
it
was
touched
it
would
sink
far
far
down
and
not
come
up
again
for
some
time
at
last
one
who
thought
it
must
be
enchanted
touched
it
with
the
cross
by
way
of
breaking
the
charm
and
faith
he
did
break
it
for
the
pot
sank
out
of
sight
and
never
was
seen
any
more
all
this
is
fact
señor
for
my
grandfather
was
an
what
mateo
did
he
see
the
pot
no
señor
but
he
saw
the
hole
where
the
pot
had
it
s
the
same
thing
the
deepening
twilight
which
in
this
climate
is
of
short
duration
admonished
us
to
leave
this
haunted
ground
as
we
descended
the
mountain
defile
there
was
no
longer
herdsman
nor
muleteer
to
be
seen
nor
anything
to
be
heard
but
our
own
footsteps
and
the
lonely
chirping
of
the
cricket
the
shadows
of
the
valley
grew
deeper
and
deeper
until
all
was
dark
around
us
the
lofty
summit
of
the
sierra
nevada
alone
retained
a
lingering
gleam
of
daylight
its
snowy
peaks
glaring
against
the
dark
blue
firmament
and
seeming
close
to
us
from
the
extreme
purity
of
the
atmosphere
how
near
the
sierra
looks
this
evening
said
mateo
it
seems
as
if
you
could
touch
it
with
your
hand
and
yet
it
is
many
long
leagues
while
he
was
speaking
a
star
appeared
over
the
snowy
summit
of
the
mountain
the
only
one
yet
visible
in
the
heavens
and
so
pure
so
large
so
bright
and
beautiful
as
to
call
forth
ejaculations
of
delight
from
honest
mateo
que
estrella
hermosa
que
clara
y
limpia
es
no
pueda
ser
estrella
mas
brillante
what
a
beautiful
star
how
clear
and
lucid
a
star
could
not
be
more
brilliant
i
have
often
remarked
this
sensibility
of
the
common
people
of
spain
to
the
charms
of
natural
objects
the
lustre
of
a
star
the
beauty
or
fragrance
of
a
flower
the
crystal
purity
of
a
fountain
will
inspire
them
with
a
kind
of
poetical
delight
and
then
what
euphonious
words
their
magnificent
language
affords
with
which
to
give
utterance
to
their
transports
but
what
lights
are
those
mateo
which
i
see
twinkling
along
the
sierra
nevada
just
below
the
snowy
region
and
which
might
be
taken
for
stars
only
that
they
are
ruddy
and
against
the
dark
side
of
the
mountain
those
señor
are
fires
made
by
the
men
who
gather
snow
and
ice
for
the
supply
of
granada
they
go
up
every
afternoon
with
mules
and
asses
and
take
turns
some
to
rest
and
warm
themselves
by
the
fires
while
others
fill
the
panniers
with
ice
they
then
set
off
down
the
mountains
so
as
to
reach
the
gates
of
granada
before
sunrise
that
sierra
nevada
señor
is
a
lump
of
ice
in
the
middle
of
andalusia
to
keep
it
all
cool
in
it
was
now
completely
dark
we
were
passing
through
the
barranco
where
stood
the
cross
of
the
murdered
muleteer
when
i
beheld
a
number
of
lights
moving
at
a
distance
and
apparently
advancing
up
the
ravine
on
nearer
approach
they
proved
to
be
torches
borne
by
a
train
of
uncouth
figures
arrayed
in
black
it
would
have
been
a
procession
dreary
enough
at
any
time
but
was
peculiarly
so
in
this
wild
and
solitary
place
mateo
drew
near
and
told
me
in
a
low
voice
that
it
was
a
funeral
train
bearing
a
corpse
to
the
among
the
hills
as
the
procession
passed
by
the
lugubrious
light
of
the
torches
falling
on
the
rugged
features
and
of
the
attendants
had
the
most
fantastic
effect
but
was
perfectly
ghastly
as
it
revealed
the
countenance
of
the
corpse
which
according
to
the
spanish
custom
was
borne
uncovered
on
an
open
bier
i
remained
for
some
time
gazing
after
the
dreary
train
as
it
wound
up
the
dark
defile
of
the
mountain
it
put
me
in
mind
of
the
old
story
of
a
procession
of
demons
bearing
the
body
of
a
sinner
up
the
crater
of
stromboli
ah
señor
cried
mateo
i
could
tell
you
a
story
of
a
procession
once
seen
among
these
mountains
but
then
you
d
laugh
at
me
and
say
it
was
one
of
the
legacies
of
my
grandfather
the
by
no
means
mateo
there
is
nothing
i
relish
more
than
a
marvellous
well
señor
it
is
about
one
of
those
very
men
we
have
been
talking
of
who
gather
snow
on
the
sierra
nevada
you
must
know
that
a
great
many
years
since
in
my
grandfather
s
time
there
was
an
old
fellow
tio
nicolo
uncle
nicholas
by
name
who
had
filled
the
panniers
of
his
mule
with
snow
and
ice
and
was
returning
down
the
mountain
being
very
drowsy
he
mounted
upon
the
mule
and
soon
falling
asleep
went
with
his
head
nodding
and
bobbing
about
from
side
to
side
while
his
old
mule
stepped
along
the
edge
of
precipices
and
down
steep
and
broken
barrancos
just
as
safe
and
steady
as
if
it
had
been
on
plain
ground
at
length
tio
nicolo
awoke
and
gazed
about
him
and
rubbed
his
eyes
and
in
good
truth
he
had
reason
the
moon
shone
almost
as
bright
as
day
and
he
saw
the
city
below
him
as
plain
as
your
hand
and
shining
with
its
white
buildings
like
a
silver
platter
in
the
moonshine
but
lord
señor
it
was
nothing
like
the
city
he
had
left
a
few
hours
before
instead
of
the
cathedral
with
its
great
dome
and
turrets
and
the
churches
with
their
spires
and
the
convents
with
their
pinnacles
all
surmounted
with
the
blessed
cross
he
saw
nothing
but
moorish
mosques
and
minarets
and
cupolas
all
topped
off
with
glittering
crescents
such
as
you
see
on
the
barbary
flags
well
señor
as
you
may
suppose
tio
nicolo
was
mightily
puzzled
at
all
this
but
while
he
was
gazing
down
upon
the
city
a
great
army
came
marching
up
the
mountains
winding
along
the
ravines
sometimes
in
the
moonshine
sometimes
in
the
shade
as
it
drew
nigh
he
saw
that
there
were
horse
and
foot
all
in
moorish
armor
tio
nicolo
tried
to
scramble
out
of
their
way
but
his
old
mule
stood
stockstill
and
refused
to
budge
trembling
at
the
same
time
like
a
leaf
for
dumb
beasts
señor
are
just
as
much
frightened
at
such
things
as
human
beings
well
señor
the
hobgoblin
army
came
marching
by
there
were
men
that
seemed
to
blow
trumpets
and
others
to
beat
drums
and
strike
cymbals
yet
never
a
sound
did
they
make
they
all
moved
on
without
the
least
noise
just
as
i
have
seen
painted
armies
move
across
the
stage
in
the
theatre
of
granada
and
all
looked
as
pale
as
death
at
last
in
the
rear
of
the
army
between
two
black
moorish
horsemen
rode
the
grand
inquisitor
of
granada
on
a
mule
as
white
as
snow
tio
nicolo
wondered
to
see
him
in
such
company
for
the
inquisitor
was
famous
for
his
hatred
of
moors
and
indeed
of
all
kinds
of
infidels
jews
and
heretics
and
used
to
hunt
them
out
with
fire
and
scourge
however
tio
nicolo
felt
himself
safe
now
that
there
was
a
priest
of
such
sanctity
at
hand
so
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
he
called
out
for
his
benediction
when
hombre
he
received
a
blow
that
sent
him
and
his
old
mule
over
the
edge
of
a
steep
bank
down
which
they
rolled
to
the
bottom
tio
nicolo
did
not
come
to
his
senses
until
long
after
sunrise
when
he
found
himself
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
ravine
his
mule
grazing
beside
him
and
his
panniers
of
snow
completely
melted
he
crawled
back
to
granada
sorely
bruised
and
battered
but
was
glad
to
find
the
city
looking
as
usual
with
christian
churches
and
crosses
when
he
told
the
story
of
his
night
s
adventure
every
one
laughed
at
him
some
said
he
had
dreamed
it
all
as
he
dozed
on
his
mule
others
thought
it
all
a
fabrication
of
his
own
but
what
was
strange
señor
and
made
people
afterwards
think
more
seriously
of
the
matter
was
that
the
grand
inquisitor
died
within
the
year
i
have
often
heard
my
grandfather
the
tailor
say
that
there
was
more
meant
by
that
hobgoblin
army
bearing
off
the
resemblance
of
the
priest
than
folks
dared
to
then
you
would
insinuate
friend
mateo
that
there
is
a
kind
of
moorish
limbo
or
purgatory
in
the
bowels
of
these
mountains
to
which
the
padre
inquisitor
was
borne
god
forbid
señor
i
know
nothing
of
the
matter
i
only
relate
what
i
heard
from
my
by
the
time
mateo
had
finished
the
tale
which
i
have
more
succinctly
related
and
which
was
interlarded
with
many
comments
and
spun
out
with
minute
details
we
reached
the
gate
of
the
alhambra
the
marvellous
stories
hinted
at
by
mateo
in
the
early
part
of
our
ramble
about
the
tower
of
the
seven
floors
set
me
as
usual
upon
my
goblin
researches
i
found
that
the
redoubtable
phantom
the
belludo
had
been
time
out
of
mind
a
favorite
theme
of
nursery
tales
and
popular
traditions
in
granada
and
that
honorable
mention
had
even
been
made
of
it
by
an
ancient
historian
and
topographer
of
the
place
the
scattered
members
of
one
of
these
popular
traditions
i
have
gathered
together
collated
them
with
infinite
pains
and
digested
them
into
the
following
legend
which
only
wants
a
number
of
learned
notes
and
references
at
bottom
to
take
its
rank
among
those
concrete
productions
gravely
passed
upon
the
world
for
historical
facts
legend
of
the
moor
s
legacy
just
within
the
fortress
of
the
alhambra
in
front
of
the
royal
palace
is
a
broad
open
esplanade
called
the
place
or
square
of
the
cisterns
la
plaza
de
los
algibes
so
called
from
being
undermined
by
reservoirs
of
water
hidden
from
sight
and
which
have
existed
from
the
time
of
the
moors
at
one
corner
of
this
esplanade
is
a
moorish
well
cut
through
the
living
rock
to
a
great
depth
the
water
of
which
is
cold
as
ice
and
clear
as
crystal
the
wells
made
by
the
moors
are
always
in
repute
for
it
is
well
known
what
pains
they
took
to
penetrate
to
the
purest
and
sweetest
springs
and
fountains
the
one
of
which
we
now
speak
is
famous
throughout
granada
insomuch
that
some
bearing
great
on
their
shoulders
others
driving
asses
before
them
laden
with
earthen
vessels
are
ascending
and
descending
the
steep
woody
avenues
of
the
alhambra
from
early
dawn
until
a
late
hour
of
the
night
fountains
and
wells
ever
since
the
scriptural
days
have
been
noted
in
hot
climates
and
at
the
well
in
question
there
is
a
kind
of
perpetual
club
kept
up
during
the
livelong
day
by
the
invalids
old
women
and
other
curious
folk
of
the
fortress
who
sit
here
on
the
stone
benches
under
an
awning
spread
over
the
well
to
shelter
the
from
the
sun
and
dawdle
over
the
gossip
of
the
fortress
and
question
every
that
arrives
about
the
news
of
the
city
and
make
long
comments
on
everything
they
hear
and
see
not
an
hour
of
the
day
but
loitering
housewives
and
idle
may
be
seen
lingering
with
pitcher
on
head
or
in
hand
to
hear
the
last
of
the
endless
tattle
of
these
worthies
among
the
who
once
resorted
to
this
well
there
was
a
sturdy
little
fellow
named
pedro
gil
but
called
peregil
for
shortness
being
a
he
was
a
gallego
or
native
of
gallicia
of
course
nature
seems
to
have
formed
races
of
men
as
she
has
of
animals
for
different
kinds
of
drudgery
in
france
the
shoeblacks
are
all
savoyards
the
porters
of
hotels
all
swiss
and
in
the
days
of
hoops
and
in
england
no
man
could
give
the
regular
swing
to
a
but
a
irishman
so
in
spain
the
carriers
of
water
and
bearers
of
burdens
are
all
sturdy
little
natives
of
gallicia
no
man
says
get
me
a
porter
but
call
a
to
return
from
this
digression
peregil
the
gallego
had
begun
business
with
merely
a
great
earthen
jar
which
he
carried
upon
his
shoulder
by
degrees
he
rose
in
the
world
and
was
enabled
to
purchase
an
assistant
of
a
correspondent
class
of
animals
being
a
stout
donkey
on
each
side
of
this
his
in
a
kind
of
pannier
were
slung
his
covered
with
to
protect
them
from
the
sun
there
was
not
a
more
industrious
in
all
granada
nor
one
more
merry
withal
the
streets
rang
with
his
cheerful
voice
as
he
trudged
after
his
donkey
singing
forth
the
usual
summer
note
that
resounds
through
the
spanish
towns
quiere
agua
agua
mas
fria
que
la
nieve
who
wants
water
water
colder
than
snow
who
wants
water
from
the
well
of
the
alhambra
cold
as
ice
and
clear
as
crystal
when
he
served
a
customer
with
a
sparkling
glass
it
was
always
with
a
pleasant
word
that
caused
a
smile
and
if
perchance
it
was
a
comely
dame
or
dimpling
damsel
it
was
always
with
a
sly
leer
and
a
compliment
to
her
beauty
that
was
irresistible
thus
peregil
the
gallego
was
noted
throughout
all
granada
for
being
one
of
the
civilest
pleasantest
and
happiest
of
mortals
yet
it
is
not
he
who
sings
loudest
and
jokes
most
that
has
the
lightest
heart
under
all
this
air
of
merriment
honest
peregil
had
his
cares
and
troubles
he
had
a
large
family
of
ragged
children
to
support
who
were
hungry
and
clamorous
as
a
nest
of
young
swallows
and
beset
him
with
their
outcries
for
food
whenever
he
came
home
of
an
evening
he
had
a
helpmate
too
who
was
anything
but
a
help
to
him
she
had
been
a
village
beauty
before
marriage
noted
for
her
skill
at
dancing
the
bolero
and
rattling
the
castanets
and
she
still
retained
her
early
propensities
spending
the
hard
earnings
of
honest
peregil
in
frippery
and
laying
the
very
donkey
under
requisition
for
junketing
parties
into
the
country
on
sundays
and
saints
days
and
those
innumerable
holidays
which
are
rather
more
numerous
in
spain
than
the
days
of
the
week
with
all
this
she
was
a
little
of
a
slattern
something
more
of
a
and
above
all
a
gossip
of
the
first
water
neglecting
house
household
and
everything
else
to
loiter
slipshod
in
the
houses
of
her
gossip
neighbors
he
however
who
tempers
the
wind
to
the
shorn
lamb
accommodates
the
yoke
of
matrimony
to
the
submissive
neck
peregil
bore
all
the
heavy
dispensations
of
wife
and
children
with
as
meek
a
spirit
as
his
donkey
bore
the
and
however
he
might
shake
his
ears
in
private
never
ventured
to
question
the
household
virtues
of
his
slattern
spouse
he
loved
his
children
too
even
as
an
owl
loves
its
owlets
seeing
in
them
his
own
image
multiplied
and
perpetuated
for
they
were
a
sturdy
little
brood
the
great
pleasure
of
honest
peregil
was
whenever
he
could
afford
himself
a
scanty
holiday
and
had
a
handful
of
maravedis
to
spare
to
take
the
whole
litter
forth
with
him
some
in
his
arms
some
tugging
at
his
skirts
and
some
trudging
at
his
heels
and
to
treat
them
to
a
gambol
among
the
orchards
of
the
vega
while
his
wife
was
dancing
with
her
holiday
friends
in
the
angosturas
of
the
darro
it
was
a
late
hour
one
summer
night
and
most
of
the
had
desisted
from
their
toils
the
day
had
been
uncommonly
sultry
the
night
was
one
of
those
delicious
moonlights
which
tempt
the
inhabitants
of
southern
climes
to
indemnify
themselves
for
the
heat
and
inaction
of
the
day
by
lingering
in
the
open
air
and
enjoying
its
tempered
sweetness
until
after
midnight
customers
for
water
were
therefore
still
abroad
peregil
like
a
considerate
painstaking
father
thought
of
his
hungry
children
one
more
journey
to
the
well
said
he
to
himself
to
earn
a
sunday
s
puchero
for
the
little
so
saying
he
trudged
manfully
up
the
steep
avenue
of
the
alhambra
singing
as
he
went
and
now
and
then
bestowing
a
hearty
thwack
with
a
cudgel
on
the
flanks
of
his
donkey
either
by
way
of
cadence
to
the
song
or
refreshment
to
the
animal
for
dry
blows
serve
in
lieu
of
provender
in
spain
for
all
beasts
of
burden
when
arrived
at
the
well
he
found
it
deserted
by
every
one
except
a
solitary
stranger
in
moorish
garb
seated
on
a
stone
bench
in
the
moonlight
peregil
paused
at
first
and
regarded
him
with
surprise
not
unmixed
with
awe
but
the
moor
feebly
beckoned
him
to
approach
i
am
faint
and
ill
said
he
aid
me
to
return
to
the
city
and
i
will
pay
thee
double
what
thou
couldst
gain
by
thy
jars
of
the
honest
heart
of
the
little
was
touched
with
compassion
at
the
appeal
of
the
stranger
god
forbid
said
he
that
i
should
ask
fee
or
reward
for
doing
a
common
act
of
he
accordingly
helped
the
moor
on
his
donkey
and
set
off
slowly
for
granada
the
poor
moslem
being
so
weak
that
it
was
necessary
to
hold
him
on
the
animal
to
keep
him
from
falling
to
the
earth
when
they
entered
the
city
the
demanded
whither
he
should
conduct
him
alas
said
the
moor
faintly
i
have
neither
home
nor
habitation
i
am
a
stranger
in
the
land
suffer
me
to
lay
my
head
this
night
beneath
thy
roof
and
thou
shalt
be
amply
honest
peregil
thus
saw
himself
unexpectedly
saddled
with
an
infidel
guest
but
he
was
too
humane
to
refuse
a
night
s
shelter
to
a
in
so
forlorn
a
plight
so
he
conducted
the
moor
to
his
dwelling
the
children
who
had
sallied
forth
as
usual
on
hearing
the
tramp
of
the
donkey
ran
back
with
affright
when
they
beheld
the
turbaned
stranger
and
hid
themselves
behind
their
mother
the
latter
stepped
forth
intrepidly
like
a
ruffling
hen
before
her
brood
when
a
vagrant
dog
approaches
what
infidel
companion
cried
she
is
this
you
have
brought
home
at
this
late
hour
to
draw
upon
us
the
eyes
of
the
inquisition
be
quiet
wife
replied
the
gallego
here
is
a
poor
sick
stranger
without
friend
or
home
wouldst
thou
turn
him
forth
to
perish
in
the
streets
the
wife
would
still
have
remonstrated
for
although
she
lived
in
a
hovel
she
was
a
furious
stickler
for
the
credit
of
her
house
the
little
however
for
once
was
stiffnecked
and
refused
to
bend
beneath
the
yoke
he
assisted
the
poor
moslem
to
alight
and
spread
a
mat
and
a
for
him
on
the
ground
in
the
coolest
part
of
the
house
being
the
only
kind
of
bed
that
his
poverty
afforded
in
a
little
while
the
moor
was
seized
with
violent
convulsions
which
defied
all
the
ministering
skill
of
the
simple
the
eye
of
the
poor
patient
acknowledged
his
kindness
during
an
interval
of
his
fits
he
called
him
to
his
side
and
addressing
him
in
a
low
voice
my
end
said
he
i
fear
is
at
hand
if
i
die
i
bequeath
you
this
box
as
a
reward
for
your
charity
so
saying
he
opened
his
albornoz
or
cloak
and
showed
a
small
box
of
strapped
round
his
body
god
grant
my
friend
replied
the
worthy
little
gallego
that
you
may
live
many
years
to
enjoy
your
treasure
whatever
it
may
the
moor
shook
his
head
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
box
and
would
have
said
something
more
concerning
it
but
his
convulsions
returned
with
increasing
violence
and
in
a
little
while
he
expired
the
s
wife
was
now
as
one
distracted
this
comes
said
she
of
your
foolish
always
running
into
scrapes
to
oblige
others
what
will
become
of
us
when
this
corpse
is
found
in
our
house
we
shall
be
sent
to
prison
as
murderers
and
if
we
escape
with
our
lives
shall
be
ruined
by
notaries
and
poor
peregil
was
in
equal
tribulation
and
almost
repented
himself
of
having
done
a
good
deed
at
length
a
thought
struck
him
it
is
not
yet
day
said
he
i
can
convey
the
dead
body
out
of
the
city
and
bury
it
in
the
sands
on
the
banks
of
the
xenil
no
one
saw
the
moor
enter
our
dwelling
and
no
one
will
know
anything
of
his
so
said
so
done
the
wife
aided
him
they
rolled
the
body
of
the
unfortunate
moslem
in
the
mat
on
which
he
had
expired
laid
it
across
the
ass
and
peregil
set
out
with
it
for
the
banks
of
the
river
as
ill
luck
would
have
it
there
lived
opposite
to
the
a
barber
named
pedrillo
pedrugo
one
of
the
most
prying
tattling
and
of
his
gossip
tribe
he
was
a
varlet
supple
and
insinuating
the
famous
barber
of
seville
could
not
surpass
him
for
his
universal
knowledge
of
the
affairs
of
others
and
he
had
no
more
power
of
retention
than
a
sieve
it
was
said
that
he
slept
but
with
one
eye
at
a
time
and
kept
one
ear
uncovered
so
that
even
in
his
sleep
he
might
see
and
hear
all
that
was
going
on
certain
it
is
he
was
a
sort
of
scandalous
chronicle
for
the
quidnuncs
of
granada
and
had
more
customers
than
all
the
rest
of
his
fraternity
this
meddlesome
barber
heard
peregil
arrive
at
an
unusual
hour
at
night
and
the
exclamations
of
his
wife
and
children
his
head
was
instantly
popped
out
of
a
little
window
which
served
him
as
a
and
he
saw
his
neighbor
assist
a
man
in
moorish
garb
into
his
dwelling
this
was
so
strange
an
occurrence
that
pedrillo
pedrugo
slept
not
a
wink
that
night
every
five
minutes
he
was
at
his
loophole
watching
the
lights
that
gleamed
through
the
chinks
of
his
neighbor
s
door
and
before
daylight
he
beheld
peregil
sally
forth
with
his
donkey
unusually
laden
the
inquisitive
barber
was
in
a
fidget
he
slipped
on
his
clothes
and
stealing
forth
silently
followed
the
at
a
distance
until
he
saw
him
dig
a
hole
in
the
sandy
bank
of
the
xenil
and
bury
something
that
had
the
appearance
of
a
dead
body
the
barber
hied
him
home
and
fidgeted
about
his
shop
setting
everything
upside
down
until
sunrise
he
then
took
a
basin
under
his
arm
and
sallied
forth
to
the
house
of
his
daily
customer
the
alcalde
the
alcalde
was
just
risen
pedrillo
pedrugo
seated
him
in
a
chair
threw
a
napkin
round
his
neck
put
a
basin
of
hot
water
under
his
chin
and
began
to
mollify
his
beard
with
his
fingers
strange
doings
said
pedrugo
who
played
barber
and
newsmonger
at
the
same
time
strange
doings
robbery
and
murder
and
burial
all
in
one
night
hey
how
what
is
that
you
say
cried
the
alcalde
i
say
replied
the
barber
rubbing
a
piece
of
soap
over
the
nose
and
mouth
of
the
dignitary
for
a
spanish
barber
disdains
to
employ
a
brush
i
say
that
peregil
the
gallego
has
robbed
and
murdered
a
moorish
mussulman
and
buried
him
this
blessed
night
sea
la
accursed
be
the
night
for
the
same
but
how
do
you
know
all
this
demanded
the
alcalde
be
patient
señor
and
you
shall
hear
all
about
it
replied
pedrillo
taking
him
by
the
nose
and
sliding
a
razor
over
his
cheek
he
then
recounted
all
that
he
had
seen
going
through
both
operations
at
the
same
time
shaving
his
beard
washing
his
chin
and
wiping
him
dry
with
a
dirty
napkin
while
he
was
robbing
murdering
and
burying
the
moslem
now
it
so
happened
that
this
alcalde
was
one
of
the
most
overbearing
and
at
the
same
time
most
griping
and
corrupt
curmudgeons
in
all
granada
it
could
not
be
denied
however
that
he
set
a
high
value
upon
justice
for
he
sold
it
at
its
weight
in
gold
he
presumed
the
case
in
point
to
be
one
of
murder
and
robbery
doubtless
there
must
be
a
rich
spoil
how
was
it
to
be
secured
into
the
legitimate
hands
of
the
law
for
as
to
merely
entrapping
the
delinquent
that
would
be
feeding
the
gallows
but
entrapping
the
booty
that
would
be
enriching
the
judge
and
such
according
to
his
creed
was
the
great
end
of
justice
so
thinking
he
summoned
to
his
presence
his
trustiest
alguazil
a
gaunt
varlet
clad
according
to
the
custom
of
his
order
in
the
ancient
spanish
garb
a
broad
black
beaver
turned
up
at
its
sides
a
quaint
ruff
a
small
black
cloak
dangling
from
his
shoulders
rusty
black
that
set
off
his
spare
wiry
frame
while
in
his
hand
he
bore
a
slender
white
wand
the
dreaded
insignia
of
his
office
such
was
the
legal
bloodhound
of
the
ancient
spanish
breed
that
he
put
upon
the
traces
of
the
unlucky
and
such
was
his
speed
and
certainty
that
he
was
upon
the
haunches
of
poor
peregil
before
he
had
returned
to
his
dwelling
and
brought
both
him
and
his
donkey
before
the
dispenser
of
justice
the
alcalde
bent
upon
him
one
of
the
most
terrific
frowns
hark
ye
culprit
roared
he
in
a
voice
that
made
the
knees
of
the
little
gallego
smite
together
hark
ye
culprit
there
is
no
need
of
denying
thy
guilt
everything
is
known
to
me
a
gallows
is
the
proper
reward
for
the
crime
thou
hast
committed
but
i
am
merciful
and
readily
listen
to
reason
the
man
that
has
been
murdered
in
thy
house
was
a
moor
an
infidel
the
enemy
of
our
faith
it
was
doubtless
in
a
fit
of
religious
zeal
that
thou
hast
slain
him
i
will
be
indulgent
therefore
render
up
the
property
of
which
thou
hast
robbed
him
and
we
will
hush
the
matter
the
poor
called
upon
all
the
saints
to
witness
his
innocence
alas
not
one
of
them
appeared
and
if
they
had
the
alcalde
would
have
disbelieved
the
whole
calendar
the
related
the
whole
story
of
the
dying
moor
with
the
straightforward
simplicity
of
truth
but
it
was
all
in
vain
wilt
thou
persist
in
saying
demanded
the
judge
that
this
moslem
had
neither
gold
nor
jewels
which
were
the
object
of
thy
cupidity
as
i
hope
to
be
saved
your
worship
replied
the
he
had
nothing
but
a
small
box
of
which
he
bequeathed
to
me
in
reward
for
my
a
box
of
a
box
of
exclaimed
the
alcalde
his
eyes
sparkling
at
the
idea
of
precious
jewels
and
where
is
this
box
where
have
you
concealed
it
an
it
please
your
grace
replied
the
it
is
in
one
of
the
panniers
of
my
mule
and
heartily
at
the
service
of
your
he
had
hardly
spoken
the
words
when
the
keen
alguazil
darted
off
and
reappeared
in
an
instant
with
the
mysterious
box
of
the
alcalde
opened
it
with
an
eager
and
trembling
hand
all
pressed
forward
to
gaze
upon
the
treasure
it
was
expected
to
contain
when
to
their
disappointment
nothing
appeared
within
but
a
parchment
scroll
covered
with
arabic
characters
and
an
end
of
a
waxen
taper
when
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
by
the
conviction
of
a
prisoner
justice
even
in
spain
is
apt
to
be
impartial
the
alcalde
having
recovered
from
his
disappointment
and
found
that
there
was
really
no
booty
in
the
case
now
listened
dispassionately
to
the
explanation
of
the
which
was
corroborated
by
the
testimony
of
his
wife
being
convinced
therefore
of
his
innocence
he
discharged
him
from
arrest
nay
more
he
permitted
him
to
carry
off
the
moor
s
legacy
the
box
of
and
its
contents
as
the
reward
of
his
humanity
but
he
retained
his
donkey
in
payment
of
costs
and
charges
behold
the
unfortunate
little
gallego
reduced
once
more
to
the
necessity
of
being
his
own
and
trudging
up
to
the
well
of
the
alhambra
with
a
great
earthen
jar
upon
his
shoulder
as
he
toiled
up
the
hill
in
the
heat
of
a
summer
noon
his
usual
forsook
him
dog
of
an
alcalde
would
he
cry
to
rob
a
poor
man
of
the
means
of
his
subsistence
of
the
best
friend
he
had
in
the
world
and
then
at
the
remembrance
of
the
beloved
companion
of
his
labors
all
the
kindness
of
his
nature
would
break
forth
ah
donkey
of
my
heart
would
he
exclaim
resting
his
burden
on
a
stone
and
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
brow
ah
donkey
of
my
heart
i
warrant
me
thou
thinkest
of
thy
old
master
i
warrant
me
thou
missest
the
poor
to
add
to
his
afflictions
his
wife
received
him
on
his
return
home
with
whimperings
and
repinings
she
had
clearly
the
of
him
having
warned
him
not
to
commit
the
egregious
act
of
hospitality
which
had
brought
on
him
all
these
misfortunes
and
like
a
knowing
woman
she
took
every
occasion
to
throw
her
superior
sagacity
in
his
teeth
if
her
children
lacked
food
or
needed
a
new
garment
she
could
answer
with
a
sneer
go
to
your
father
he
is
heir
to
king
chico
of
the
alhambra
ask
him
to
help
you
out
of
the
moor
s
strong
was
ever
poor
mortal
so
soundly
punished
for
having
done
a
good
action
the
unlucky
peregil
was
grieved
in
flesh
and
spirit
but
still
he
bore
meekly
with
the
railings
of
his
spouse
at
length
one
evening
when
after
a
hot
day
s
toil
she
taunted
him
in
the
usual
manner
he
lost
all
patience
he
did
not
venture
to
retort
upon
her
but
his
eye
rested
upon
the
box
of
which
lay
on
a
shelf
with
lid
half
open
as
if
laughing
in
mockery
at
his
vexation
seizing
it
up
he
dashed
it
with
indignation
to
the
floor
unlucky
was
the
day
that
i
ever
set
eyes
on
thee
he
cried
or
sheltered
thy
master
beneath
my
roof
as
the
box
struck
the
floor
the
lid
flew
wide
open
and
the
parchment
scroll
rolled
forth
peregil
sat
regarding
the
scroll
for
some
time
in
moody
silence
at
length
rallying
his
ideas
who
knows
thought
he
but
this
writing
may
be
of
some
importance
as
the
moor
seems
to
have
guarded
it
with
such
care
picking
it
up
therefore
he
put
it
in
his
bosom
and
the
next
morning
as
he
was
crying
water
through
the
streets
he
stopped
at
the
shop
of
a
moor
a
native
of
tangiers
who
sold
trinkets
and
perfumery
in
the
zacatin
and
asked
him
to
explain
the
contents
the
moor
read
the
scroll
attentively
then
stroked
his
beard
and
smiled
this
manuscript
said
he
is
a
form
of
incantation
for
the
recovery
of
hidden
treasure
that
is
under
the
power
of
enchantment
it
is
said
to
have
such
virtue
that
the
strongest
bolts
and
bars
nay
the
adamantine
rock
itself
will
yield
before
it
bah
cried
the
little
gallego
what
is
all
that
to
me
i
am
no
enchanter
and
know
nothing
of
buried
so
saying
he
shouldered
his
left
the
scroll
in
the
hands
of
the
moor
and
trudged
forward
on
his
daily
rounds
that
evening
however
as
he
rested
himself
about
twilight
at
the
well
of
the
alhambra
he
found
a
number
of
gossips
assembled
at
the
place
and
their
conversation
as
is
not
unusual
at
that
shadowy
hour
turned
upon
old
tales
and
traditions
of
a
supernatural
nature
being
all
poor
as
rats
they
dwelt
with
peculiar
fondness
upon
the
popular
theme
of
enchanted
riches
left
by
the
moors
in
various
parts
of
the
alhambra
above
all
they
concurred
in
the
belief
that
there
were
great
treasures
buried
deep
in
the
earth
under
the
tower
of
the
seven
floors
these
stories
made
an
unusual
impression
on
the
mind
of
the
honest
peregil
and
they
sank
deeper
and
deeper
into
his
thoughts
as
he
returned
alone
down
the
darkling
avenues
if
after
all
there
should
be
treasure
hid
beneath
that
tower
and
if
the
scroll
i
left
with
the
moor
should
enable
me
to
get
at
it
in
the
sudden
ecstasy
of
the
thought
he
had
wellnigh
let
fall
his
that
night
he
tumbled
and
tossed
and
could
scarcely
get
a
wink
of
sleep
for
the
thoughts
that
were
bewildering
his
brain
bright
and
early
he
repaired
to
the
shop
of
the
moor
and
told
him
all
that
was
passing
in
his
mind
you
can
read
arabic
said
he
suppose
we
go
together
to
the
tower
and
try
the
effect
of
the
charm
if
it
fails
we
are
no
worse
off
than
before
but
if
it
succeeds
we
will
share
equally
all
the
treasure
we
may
hold
replied
the
moslem
this
writing
is
not
sufficient
of
itself
it
must
be
read
at
midnight
by
the
light
of
a
taper
singularly
compounded
and
prepared
the
ingredients
of
which
are
not
within
my
reach
without
such
a
taper
the
scroll
is
of
no
say
no
more
cried
the
little
gallego
i
have
such
a
taper
at
hand
and
will
bring
it
here
in
a
so
saying
he
hastened
home
and
soon
returned
with
the
end
of
yellow
wax
taper
that
he
had
found
in
the
box
of
the
moor
felt
it
and
smelt
to
it
here
are
rare
and
costly
perfumes
said
he
combined
with
this
yellow
wax
this
is
the
kind
of
taper
specified
in
the
scroll
while
this
burns
the
strongest
walls
and
most
secret
caverns
will
remain
open
woe
to
him
however
who
lingers
within
until
it
be
extinguished
he
will
remain
enchanted
with
the
it
was
now
agreed
between
them
to
try
the
charm
that
very
night
at
a
late
hour
therefore
when
nothing
was
stirring
but
bats
and
owls
they
ascended
the
woody
hill
of
the
alhambra
and
approached
that
awful
tower
shrouded
by
trees
and
rendered
formidable
by
so
many
traditionary
tales
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
they
groped
their
way
through
bushes
and
over
fallen
stones
to
the
door
of
a
vault
beneath
the
tower
with
fear
and
trembling
they
descended
a
flight
of
steps
cut
into
the
rock
it
led
to
an
empty
chamber
damp
and
drear
from
which
another
flight
of
steps
led
to
a
deeper
vault
in
this
way
they
descended
four
several
flights
leading
into
as
many
vaults
one
below
the
other
but
the
floor
of
the
fourth
was
solid
and
though
according
to
tradition
there
remained
three
vaults
still
below
it
was
said
to
be
impossible
to
penetrate
further
the
residue
being
shut
up
by
strong
enchantment
the
air
of
this
vault
was
damp
and
chilly
and
had
an
earthy
smell
and
the
light
scarce
cast
forth
any
rays
they
paused
here
for
a
time
in
breathless
suspense
until
they
faintly
heard
the
clock
of
the
strike
midnight
upon
this
they
lit
the
waxen
taper
which
diffused
an
odor
of
myrrh
and
frankincense
and
storax
the
moor
began
to
read
in
a
hurried
voice
he
had
scarce
finished
when
there
was
a
noise
as
of
subterraneous
thunder
the
earth
shook
and
the
floor
yawning
open
disclosed
a
flight
of
steps
trembling
with
awe
they
descended
and
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
found
themselves
in
another
vault
covered
with
arabic
inscriptions
in
the
centre
stood
a
great
chest
secured
with
seven
bands
of
steel
at
each
end
of
which
sat
an
enchanted
moor
in
armor
but
motionless
as
a
statue
being
controlled
by
the
power
of
the
incantation
before
the
chest
were
several
jars
filled
with
gold
and
silver
and
precious
stones
in
the
largest
of
these
they
thrust
their
arms
up
to
the
elbow
and
at
every
dip
hauled
forth
handfuls
of
broad
yellow
pieces
of
moorish
gold
or
bracelets
and
ornaments
of
the
same
precious
metal
while
occasionally
a
necklace
of
oriental
pearl
would
stick
to
their
fingers
still
they
trembled
and
breathed
short
while
cramming
their
pockets
with
the
spoils
and
cast
many
a
fearful
glance
at
the
two
enchanted
moors
who
sat
grim
and
motionless
glaring
upon
them
with
unwinking
eyes
at
length
struck
with
a
sudden
panic
at
some
fancied
noise
they
both
rushed
up
the
staircase
tumbled
over
one
another
into
the
upper
apartment
overturned
and
extinguished
the
waxen
taper
and
the
pavement
again
closed
with
a
thundering
sound
filled
with
dismay
they
did
not
pause
until
they
had
groped
their
way
out
of
the
tower
and
beheld
the
stars
shining
through
the
trees
then
seating
themselves
upon
the
grass
they
divided
the
spoil
determining
to
content
themselves
for
the
present
with
this
mere
skimming
of
the
jars
but
to
return
on
some
future
night
and
drain
them
to
the
bottom
to
make
sure
of
each
other
s
good
faith
also
they
divided
the
talismans
between
them
one
retaining
the
scroll
and
the
other
the
taper
this
done
they
set
off
with
light
hearts
and
pockets
for
granada
as
they
wended
their
way
down
the
hill
the
shrewd
moor
whispered
a
word
of
counsel
in
the
ear
of
the
simple
little
friend
peregil
said
he
all
this
affair
must
be
kept
a
profound
secret
until
we
have
secured
the
treasure
and
conveyed
it
out
of
harm
s
way
if
a
whisper
of
it
gets
to
the
ear
of
the
alcalde
we
are
undone
certainly
replied
the
gallego
nothing
can
be
more
friend
peregil
said
the
moor
you
are
a
discreet
man
and
i
make
no
doubt
can
keep
a
secret
but
you
have
a
she
shall
not
know
a
word
of
it
replied
the
little
sturdily
enough
said
the
moor
i
depend
upon
thy
discretion
and
thy
never
was
promise
more
positive
and
sincere
but
alas
what
man
can
keep
a
secret
from
his
wife
certainly
not
such
a
one
as
peregil
the
who
was
one
of
the
most
loving
and
tractable
of
husbands
on
his
return
home
he
found
his
wife
moping
in
a
corner
mighty
well
cried
she
as
he
entered
you
ve
come
at
last
after
rambling
about
until
this
hour
of
the
night
i
wonder
you
have
not
brought
home
another
moor
as
a
then
bursting
into
tears
she
began
to
wring
her
hands
and
smite
her
breast
unhappy
woman
that
i
am
exclaimed
she
what
will
become
of
me
my
house
stripped
and
plundered
by
lawyers
and
alguazils
my
husband
a
that
no
longer
brings
home
bread
to
his
family
but
goes
rambling
about
day
and
night
with
infidel
moors
o
my
children
my
children
what
will
become
of
us
we
shall
all
have
to
beg
in
the
streets
honest
peregil
was
so
moved
by
the
distress
of
his
spouse
that
he
could
not
help
whimpering
also
his
heart
was
as
full
as
his
pocket
and
not
to
be
restrained
thrusting
his
hand
into
the
latter
he
hauled
forth
three
or
four
broad
gold
pieces
and
slipped
them
into
her
bosom
the
poor
woman
stared
with
astonishment
and
could
not
understand
the
meaning
of
this
golden
shower
before
she
could
recover
her
surprise
the
little
gallego
drew
forth
a
chain
of
gold
and
dangled
it
before
her
capering
with
exultation
his
mouth
distended
from
ear
to
ear
holy
virgin
protect
us
exclaimed
the
wife
what
hast
thou
been
doing
peregil
surely
thou
hast
not
been
committing
murder
and
robbery
the
idea
scarce
entered
the
brain
of
the
poor
woman
than
it
became
a
certainty
with
her
she
saw
a
prison
and
a
gallows
in
the
distance
and
a
little
gallego
hanging
pendent
from
it
and
overcome
by
the
horrors
conjured
up
by
her
imagination
fell
into
violent
hysterics
what
could
the
poor
man
do
he
had
no
other
means
of
pacifying
his
wife
and
dispelling
the
phantoms
of
her
fancy
than
by
relating
the
whole
story
of
his
good
fortune
this
however
he
did
not
do
until
he
had
exacted
from
her
the
most
solemn
promise
to
keep
it
a
profound
secret
from
every
living
being
to
describe
her
joy
would
be
impossible
she
flung
her
arms
round
the
neck
of
her
husband
and
almost
strangled
him
with
her
caresses
now
wife
exclaimed
the
little
man
with
honest
exultation
what
say
you
now
to
the
moor
s
legacy
henceforth
never
abuse
me
for
helping
a
in
the
honest
gallego
retired
to
his
mat
and
slept
as
soundly
as
if
on
a
bed
of
down
not
so
his
wife
she
emptied
the
whole
contents
of
his
pockets
upon
the
mat
and
sat
counting
gold
pieces
of
arabic
coin
trying
on
necklaces
and
earrings
and
fancying
the
figure
she
should
one
day
make
when
permitted
to
enjoy
her
riches
on
the
following
morning
the
honest
gallego
took
a
broad
golden
coin
and
repaired
with
it
to
a
jeweller
s
shop
in
the
zacatin
to
offer
it
for
sale
pretending
to
have
found
it
among
the
ruins
of
the
alhambra
the
jeweller
saw
that
it
had
an
arabic
inscription
and
was
of
the
purest
gold
he
offered
however
but
a
third
of
its
value
with
which
the
was
perfectly
content
peregil
now
bought
new
clothes
for
his
little
flock
and
all
kinds
of
toys
together
with
ample
provisions
for
a
hearty
meal
and
returning
to
his
dwelling
set
all
his
children
dancing
around
him
while
he
capered
in
the
midst
the
happiest
of
fathers
the
wife
of
the
kept
her
promise
of
secrecy
with
surprising
strictness
for
a
whole
day
and
a
half
she
went
about
with
a
look
of
mystery
and
a
heart
swelling
almost
to
bursting
yet
she
held
her
peace
though
surrounded
by
her
gossips
it
is
true
she
could
not
help
giving
herself
a
few
airs
apologized
for
her
ragged
dress
and
talked
of
ordering
a
new
basquiña
all
trimmed
with
gold
lace
and
bugles
and
a
new
lace
mantilla
she
threw
out
hints
of
her
husband
s
intention
of
leaving
off
his
trade
of
as
it
did
not
altogether
agree
with
his
health
in
fact
she
thought
they
should
all
retire
to
the
country
for
the
summer
that
the
children
might
have
the
benefit
of
the
mountain
air
for
there
was
no
living
in
the
city
in
this
sultry
season
the
neighbors
stared
at
each
other
and
thought
the
poor
woman
had
lost
her
wits
and
her
airs
and
graces
and
elegant
pretensions
were
the
theme
of
universal
scoffing
and
merriment
among
her
friends
the
moment
her
back
was
turned
if
she
restrained
herself
abroad
however
she
indemnified
herself
at
home
and
putting
a
string
of
rich
oriental
pearls
round
her
neck
moorish
bracelets
on
her
arms
and
an
aigrette
of
diamonds
on
her
head
sailed
backwards
and
forwards
in
her
slattern
rags
about
the
room
now
and
then
stopping
to
admire
herself
in
a
broken
mirror
nay
in
the
impulse
of
her
simple
vanity
she
could
not
resist
on
one
occasion
showing
herself
at
the
window
to
enjoy
the
effect
of
her
finery
on
the
as
the
fates
would
have
it
pedrillo
pedrugo
the
meddlesome
barber
was
at
this
moment
sitting
idly
in
his
shop
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
when
his
eye
caught
the
sparkle
of
a
diamond
in
an
instant
he
was
at
his
loophole
reconnoitring
the
slattern
spouse
of
the
decorated
with
the
splendor
of
an
eastern
bride
no
sooner
had
he
taken
an
accurate
inventory
of
her
ornaments
than
he
posted
off
with
all
speed
to
the
alcalde
in
a
little
while
the
hungry
alguazil
was
again
on
the
scent
and
before
the
day
was
over
the
unfortunate
peregil
was
once
more
dragged
into
the
presence
of
the
judge
how
is
this
villain
cried
the
alcalde
in
a
furious
voice
you
told
me
that
the
infidel
who
died
in
your
house
left
nothing
behind
but
an
empty
coffer
and
now
i
hear
of
your
wife
flaunting
in
her
rags
decked
out
with
pearls
and
diamonds
wretch
that
thou
art
prepare
to
render
up
the
spoils
of
thy
miserable
victim
and
to
swing
on
the
gallows
that
is
already
tired
of
waiting
for
the
terrified
fell
on
his
knees
and
made
a
full
relation
of
the
marvellous
manner
in
which
he
had
gained
his
wealth
the
alcalde
the
alguazil
and
the
inquisitive
barber
listened
with
greedy
ears
to
this
arabian
tale
of
enchanted
treasure
the
alguazil
was
dispatched
to
bring
the
moor
who
had
assisted
in
the
incantation
the
moslem
entered
half
frightened
out
of
his
wits
at
finding
himself
in
the
hands
of
the
harpies
of
the
law
when
he
beheld
the
standing
with
sheepish
looks
and
downcast
countenance
he
comprehended
the
whole
matter
miserable
animal
said
he
as
he
passed
near
him
did
i
not
warn
thee
against
babbling
to
thy
wife
the
story
of
the
moor
coincided
exactly
with
that
of
his
colleague
but
the
alcalde
affected
to
be
slow
of
belief
and
threw
out
menaces
of
imprisonment
and
rigorous
investigation
softly
good
señor
alcalde
said
the
mussulman
who
by
this
time
had
recovered
his
usual
shrewdness
and
let
us
not
mar
fortune
s
favors
in
the
scramble
for
them
nobody
knows
anything
of
this
matter
but
ourselves
let
us
keep
the
secret
there
is
wealth
enough
in
the
cave
to
enrich
us
all
promise
a
fair
division
and
all
shall
be
produced
refuse
and
the
cave
shall
remain
forever
the
alcalde
consulted
apart
with
the
alguazil
the
latter
was
an
old
fox
in
his
profession
promise
anything
said
he
until
you
get
possession
of
the
treasure
you
may
then
seize
upon
the
whole
and
if
he
and
his
accomplice
dare
to
murmur
threaten
them
with
the
fagot
and
the
stake
as
infidels
and
the
alcalde
relished
the
advice
smoothing
his
brow
and
turning
to
the
moor
this
is
a
strange
story
said
he
and
may
be
true
but
i
must
have
ocular
proof
of
it
this
very
night
you
must
repeat
the
incantation
in
my
presence
if
there
be
really
such
treasure
we
will
share
it
amicably
between
us
and
say
nothing
further
of
the
matter
if
ye
have
deceived
me
expect
no
mercy
at
my
hands
in
the
mean
time
you
must
remain
in
the
moor
and
the
cheerfully
agreed
to
these
conditions
satisfied
that
the
event
would
prove
the
truth
of
their
words
towards
midnight
the
alcalde
sallied
forth
secretly
attended
by
the
alguazil
and
the
meddlesome
barber
all
strongly
armed
they
conducted
the
moor
and
the
as
prisoners
and
were
provided
with
the
stout
donkey
of
the
latter
to
bear
off
the
expected
treasure
they
arrived
at
the
tower
without
being
observed
and
tying
the
donkey
to
a
descended
into
the
fourth
vault
of
the
tower
the
scroll
was
produced
the
yellow
waxen
taper
lighted
and
the
moor
read
the
form
of
incantation
the
earth
trembled
as
before
and
the
pavement
opened
with
a
thundering
sound
disclosing
the
narrow
flight
of
steps
the
alcalde
the
alguazil
and
the
barber
were
struck
aghast
and
could
not
summon
courage
to
descend
the
moor
and
the
entered
the
lower
vault
and
found
the
two
moors
seated
as
before
silent
and
motionless
they
removed
two
of
the
great
jars
filled
with
golden
coin
and
precious
stones
the
bore
them
up
one
by
one
upon
his
shoulders
but
though
a
little
man
and
accustomed
to
carry
burdens
he
staggered
beneath
their
weight
and
found
when
slung
on
each
side
of
his
donkey
they
were
as
much
as
the
animal
could
bear
let
us
be
content
for
the
present
said
the
moor
here
is
as
much
treasure
as
we
can
carry
off
without
being
perceived
and
enough
to
make
us
all
wealthy
to
our
heart
s
is
there
more
treasure
remaining
behind
demanded
the
alcalde
the
greatest
prize
of
all
said
the
moor
a
huge
coffer
bound
with
bands
of
steel
and
filled
with
pearls
and
precious
let
us
have
up
the
coffer
by
all
means
cried
the
grasping
alcalde
i
will
descend
for
no
more
said
the
moor
doggedly
enough
is
enough
for
a
reasonable
man
more
is
and
i
said
the
will
bring
up
no
further
burden
to
break
the
back
of
my
poor
finding
commands
threats
and
entreaties
equally
vain
the
alcalde
turned
to
his
two
adherents
aid
me
said
he
to
bring
up
the
coffer
and
its
contents
shall
be
divided
between
so
saying
he
descended
the
steps
followed
with
trembling
reluctance
by
the
alguazil
and
the
barber
no
sooner
did
the
moor
behold
them
fairly
earthed
than
he
extinguished
the
yellow
taper
the
pavement
closed
with
its
usual
crash
and
the
three
worthies
remained
buried
in
its
womb
he
then
hastened
up
the
different
flight
of
steps
nor
stopped
until
in
the
open
air
the
little
followed
him
as
fast
as
his
short
legs
would
permit
what
hast
thou
done
cried
peregil
as
soon
as
he
could
recover
breath
the
alcalde
and
the
other
two
are
shut
up
in
the
it
is
the
will
of
allah
said
the
moor
devoutly
and
will
you
not
release
them
demanded
the
gallego
allah
forbid
replied
the
moor
smoothing
his
beard
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
fate
that
they
shall
remain
enchanted
until
some
future
adventurer
arrive
to
break
the
charm
the
will
of
god
be
done
so
saying
he
hurled
the
end
of
the
waxen
taper
far
among
the
gloomy
thickets
of
the
glen
there
was
now
no
remedy
so
the
moor
and
the
proceeded
with
the
richly
laden
donkey
toward
the
city
nor
could
honest
peregil
refrain
from
hugging
and
kissing
his
thus
restored
to
him
from
the
clutches
of
the
law
and
in
fact
it
is
doubtful
which
gave
the
little
man
most
joy
at
the
moment
the
gaining
of
the
treasure
or
the
recovery
of
the
donkey
the
two
partners
in
good
luck
divided
their
spoil
amicably
and
fairly
except
that
the
moor
who
had
a
little
taste
for
trinketry
made
out
to
get
into
his
heap
the
most
of
the
pearls
and
precious
stones
and
other
baubles
but
then
he
always
gave
the
in
lieu
magnificent
jewels
of
massy
gold
of
five
times
the
size
with
which
the
latter
was
heartily
content
they
took
care
not
to
linger
within
reach
of
accidents
but
made
off
to
enjoy
their
wealth
undisturbed
in
other
countries
the
moor
returned
to
africa
to
his
native
city
of
tangiers
and
the
gallego
with
his
wife
his
children
and
his
donkey
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
portugal
here
under
the
admonition
and
tuition
of
his
wife
he
became
a
personage
of
some
consequence
for
she
made
the
worthy
little
man
array
his
long
body
and
short
legs
in
doublet
and
hose
with
a
feather
in
his
hat
and
a
sword
by
his
side
and
laying
aside
his
familiar
appellation
of
peregil
assume
the
more
sonorous
title
of
don
pedro
gil
his
progeny
grew
up
a
thriving
and
though
short
and
generation
while
señora
gil
befringed
belaced
and
betasselled
from
her
head
to
her
heels
with
glittering
rings
on
every
finger
became
a
model
of
slattern
fashion
and
finery
as
to
the
alcalde
and
his
adjuncts
they
remained
shut
up
under
the
great
tower
of
the
seven
floors
and
there
they
remain
at
the
present
day
whenever
there
shall
be
a
lack
in
spain
of
pimping
barbers
sharking
alguazils
and
corrupt
alcaldes
they
may
be
sought
after
but
if
they
have
to
wait
until
such
time
for
their
deliverance
there
is
danger
of
their
enchantment
enduring
until
doomsday
the
tower
of
las
infantas
in
an
evening
s
stroll
up
a
narrow
glen
overshadowed
by
pomegranates
and
myrtles
which
divides
the
lands
of
the
fortress
from
those
of
the
generalife
i
was
struck
with
the
romantic
appearance
of
a
moorish
tower
in
the
outer
wall
of
the
alhambra
rising
high
above
the
and
catching
the
ruddy
rays
of
the
setting
sun
a
solitary
window
at
a
great
height
commanded
a
view
of
the
glen
and
as
i
was
regarding
it
a
young
female
looked
out
with
her
head
adorned
with
flowers
she
was
evidently
superior
to
the
usual
class
of
people
inhabiting
the
old
towers
of
the
fortress
and
this
sudden
and
picturesque
glimpse
of
her
reminded
me
of
the
descriptions
of
captive
beauties
in
fairy
tales
these
fanciful
associations
were
increased
on
being
informed
by
my
attendant
mateo
that
this
was
the
tower
of
the
princesses
la
torre
de
las
infantas
so
called
from
having
been
according
to
tradition
the
residence
of
the
daughters
of
the
moorish
kings
i
have
since
visited
the
tower
it
is
not
generally
shown
to
strangers
though
well
worthy
of
attention
for
the
interior
is
equal
for
beauty
of
architecture
and
delicacy
of
ornament
to
any
part
of
the
palace
the
elegance
of
the
central
hall
with
its
marble
fountain
its
lofty
arches
and
richly
fretted
dome
the
arabesques
and
of
the
small
but
chambers
though
injured
by
time
and
neglect
all
accord
with
the
story
of
its
being
anciently
the
abode
of
royal
beauty
the
little
old
fairy
queen
who
lives
under
the
staircase
of
the
alhambra
and
frequents
the
evening
tertulias
of
dame
antonia
tells
some
fanciful
traditions
about
three
moorish
princesses
who
were
once
shut
up
in
this
tower
by
their
father
a
tyrant
king
of
granada
and
were
only
permitted
to
ride
out
at
night
about
the
hills
when
no
one
was
permitted
to
come
in
their
way
under
pain
of
death
they
still
according
to
her
account
may
be
seen
occasionally
when
the
moon
is
in
the
full
riding
in
lonely
places
along
the
on
palfreys
richly
caparisoned
and
sparkling
with
jewels
but
they
vanish
on
being
spoken
to
but
before
i
relate
anything
further
respecting
these
princesses
the
reader
may
be
anxious
to
know
something
about
the
fair
inhabitant
of
the
tower
with
her
head
dressed
with
flowers
who
looked
out
from
the
lofty
window
she
proved
to
be
the
newly
married
spouse
of
the
worthy
adjutant
of
invalids
who
though
well
stricken
in
years
had
had
the
courage
to
take
to
his
bosom
a
young
and
buxom
andalusian
damsel
may
the
good
old
cavalier
be
happy
in
his
choice
and
find
the
tower
of
the
princesses
a
more
secure
residence
for
female
beauty
than
it
seems
to
have
proved
in
the
time
of
the
moslems
if
we
may
believe
the
following
legend
legend
of
the
three
beautiful
princesses
in
old
times
there
reigned
a
moorish
king
in
granada
whose
name
was
mohamed
to
which
his
subjects
added
the
appellation
of
el
hayzari
or
the
some
say
he
was
so
called
on
account
of
his
being
really
more
expert
with
his
sinister
than
his
dexter
hand
others
because
he
was
prone
to
take
everything
by
the
wrong
end
or
in
other
words
to
mar
wherever
he
meddled
certain
it
is
either
through
misfortune
or
mismanagement
he
was
continually
in
trouble
thrice
was
he
driven
from
his
throne
and
on
one
occasion
barely
escaped
to
africa
with
his
life
in
the
disguise
of
a
fisherman
still
he
was
as
brave
as
he
was
blundering
and
though
wielded
his
cimeter
to
such
purpose
that
he
each
time
himself
upon
his
throne
by
dint
of
hard
fighting
instead
however
of
learning
wisdom
from
adversity
he
hardened
his
neck
and
stiffened
his
left
arm
in
wilfulness
the
evils
of
a
public
nature
which
he
thus
brought
upon
himself
and
his
kingdom
may
be
learned
by
those
who
will
delve
into
the
arabian
annals
of
granada
the
present
legend
deals
but
with
his
domestic
policy
as
this
mohamed
was
one
day
riding
forth
with
a
train
of
his
courtiers
by
the
foot
of
the
mountain
of
elvira
he
met
a
band
of
horsemen
returning
from
a
foray
into
the
land
of
the
christians
they
were
conducting
a
long
string
of
mules
laden
with
spoil
and
many
captives
of
both
sexes
among
whom
the
monarch
was
struck
with
the
appearance
of
a
beautiful
damsel
richly
attired
who
sat
weeping
on
a
low
palfrey
and
heeded
not
the
consoling
words
of
a
duenna
who
rode
beside
her
the
monarch
was
struck
with
her
beauty
and
on
inquiring
of
the
captain
of
the
troop
found
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
the
alcayde
of
a
frontier
fortress
that
had
been
surprised
and
sacked
in
the
course
of
the
foray
mohamed
claimed
her
as
his
royal
share
of
the
booty
and
had
her
conveyed
to
his
harem
in
the
alhambra
there
everything
was
devised
to
soothe
her
melancholy
and
the
monarch
more
and
more
enamored
sought
to
make
her
his
queen
the
spanish
maid
at
first
repulsed
his
addresses
he
was
an
infidel
he
was
the
open
foe
of
her
country
what
was
worse
he
was
stricken
in
years
the
monarch
finding
his
assiduities
of
no
avail
determined
to
enlist
in
his
favor
the
duenna
who
had
been
captured
with
the
lady
she
was
an
andalusian
by
birth
whose
christian
name
is
forgotten
being
mentioned
in
moorish
legends
by
no
other
appellation
than
that
of
the
discreet
kadiga
and
discreet
in
truth
she
was
as
her
whole
history
makes
evident
no
sooner
had
the
moorish
king
held
a
little
private
conversation
with
her
than
she
saw
at
once
the
cogency
of
his
reasoning
and
undertook
his
cause
with
her
young
mistress
go
to
now
cried
she
what
is
there
in
all
this
to
weep
and
wail
about
is
it
not
better
to
be
mistress
of
this
beautiful
palace
with
all
its
gardens
and
fountains
than
to
be
shut
up
within
your
father
s
old
frontier
tower
as
to
this
mohamed
being
an
infidel
what
is
that
to
the
purpose
you
marry
him
not
his
religion
and
if
he
is
waxing
a
little
old
the
sooner
will
you
be
a
widow
and
mistress
of
yourself
at
any
rate
you
are
in
his
power
and
must
either
be
a
queen
or
a
slave
when
in
the
hands
of
a
robber
it
is
better
to
sell
one
s
merchandise
for
a
fair
price
than
to
have
it
taken
by
main
the
arguments
of
the
discreet
kadiga
prevailed
the
spanish
lady
dried
her
tears
and
became
the
spouse
of
mohamed
the
she
even
conformed
in
appearance
to
the
faith
of
her
royal
husband
and
her
discreet
duenna
immediately
became
a
zealous
convert
to
the
moslem
doctrines
it
was
then
the
latter
received
the
arabian
name
of
kadiga
and
was
permitted
to
remain
in
the
confidential
employ
of
her
mistress
in
due
process
of
time
the
moorish
king
was
made
the
proud
and
happy
father
of
three
lovely
daughters
all
born
at
a
birth
he
could
have
wished
they
had
been
sons
but
consoled
himself
with
the
idea
that
three
daughters
at
a
birth
were
pretty
well
for
a
man
somewhat
stricken
in
years
and
as
usual
with
all
moslem
monarchs
he
summoned
his
astrologers
on
this
happy
event
they
cast
the
nativities
of
the
three
princesses
and
shook
their
heads
daughters
o
king
said
they
are
always
precarious
property
but
these
will
most
need
your
watchfulness
when
they
arrive
at
a
marriageable
age
at
that
time
gather
them
under
your
wings
and
trust
them
to
no
other
mohamed
the
was
acknowledged
to
be
a
wise
king
by
his
courtiers
and
was
certainly
so
considered
by
himself
the
prediction
of
the
astrologers
caused
him
but
little
disquiet
trusting
to
his
ingenuity
to
guard
his
daughters
and
outwit
the
fates
the
threefold
birth
was
the
last
matrimonial
trophy
of
the
monarch
his
queen
bore
him
no
more
children
and
died
within
a
few
years
bequeathing
her
infant
daughters
to
his
love
and
to
the
fidelity
of
the
discreet
kadiga
many
years
had
yet
to
elapse
before
the
princesses
would
arrive
at
that
period
of
danger
the
marriageable
age
it
is
good
however
to
be
cautious
in
time
said
the
shrewd
monarch
so
he
determined
to
have
them
reared
in
the
royal
castle
of
salobreña
this
was
a
sumptuous
palace
incrusted
as
it
were
in
a
powerful
moorish
fortress
on
the
summit
of
a
hill
overlooking
the
mediterranean
sea
it
was
a
royal
retreat
in
which
the
moslem
monarchs
shut
up
such
of
their
relatives
as
might
endanger
their
safety
allowing
them
all
kinds
of
luxuries
and
amusements
in
the
midst
of
which
they
passed
their
lives
in
voluptuous
indolence
here
the
princesses
remained
immured
from
the
world
but
surrounded
by
enjoyment
and
attended
by
female
slaves
who
anticipated
their
wishes
they
had
delightful
gardens
for
their
recreation
filled
with
the
rarest
fruits
and
flowers
with
aromatic
groves
and
perfumed
baths
on
three
sides
the
castle
looked
down
upon
a
rich
valley
enamelled
with
all
kinds
of
culture
and
bounded
by
the
lofty
alpuxarra
mountains
on
the
other
side
it
overlooked
the
broad
sunny
sea
in
this
delicious
abode
in
a
propitious
climate
and
under
a
cloudless
sky
the
three
princesses
grew
up
into
wondrous
beauty
but
though
all
reared
alike
they
gave
early
tokens
of
diversity
of
character
their
names
were
zayda
zorayda
and
zorahayda
and
such
was
their
order
of
seniority
for
there
had
been
precisely
three
minutes
between
their
births
zayda
the
eldest
was
of
an
intrepid
spirit
and
took
the
lead
of
her
sisters
in
everything
as
she
had
done
in
entering
into
the
world
she
was
curious
and
inquisitive
and
fond
of
getting
at
the
bottom
of
things
zorayda
had
a
great
feeling
for
beauty
which
was
the
reason
no
doubt
of
her
delighting
to
regard
her
own
image
in
a
mirror
or
a
fountain
and
of
her
fondness
for
flowers
and
jewels
and
other
tasteful
ornaments
as
to
zorahayda
the
youngest
she
was
soft
and
timid
and
extremely
sensitive
with
a
vast
deal
of
disposable
tenderness
as
was
evident
from
her
number
of
and
and
all
of
which
she
cherished
with
the
fondest
care
her
amusements
too
were
of
a
gentle
nature
and
mixed
up
with
musing
and
reverie
she
would
sit
for
hours
in
a
balcony
gazing
on
the
sparkling
stars
of
a
summer
s
night
or
on
the
sea
when
lit
up
by
the
moon
and
at
such
times
the
song
of
a
fisherman
faintly
heard
from
the
beach
or
the
notes
of
a
moorish
flute
from
some
gliding
bark
sufficed
to
elevate
her
feelings
into
ecstasy
the
least
uproar
of
the
elements
however
filled
her
with
dismay
and
a
clap
of
thunder
was
enough
to
throw
her
into
a
swoon
years
rolled
on
smoothly
and
serenely
the
discreet
kadiga
to
whom
the
princesses
were
confided
was
faithful
to
her
trust
and
attended
them
with
unremitting
care
the
castle
of
salobreña
as
has
been
said
was
built
upon
a
hill
on
the
one
of
the
exterior
walls
straggled
down
the
profile
of
the
hill
until
it
reached
a
jutting
rock
overhanging
the
sea
with
a
narrow
sandy
beach
at
its
foot
laved
by
the
rippling
billows
a
small
on
this
rock
had
been
fitted
up
as
a
pavilion
with
latticed
windows
to
admit
the
here
the
princesses
used
to
pass
the
sultry
hours
of
the
curious
zayda
was
one
day
seated
at
a
window
of
the
pavilion
as
her
sisters
reclining
on
ottomans
were
taking
the
siesta
or
noontide
slumber
her
attention
was
attracted
to
a
galley
which
came
coasting
along
with
measured
strokes
of
the
oar
as
it
drew
near
she
observed
that
it
was
filled
with
armed
men
the
galley
anchored
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
a
number
of
moorish
soldiers
landed
on
the
narrow
beach
conducting
several
christian
prisoners
the
curious
zayda
awakened
her
sisters
and
all
three
peeped
cautiously
through
the
close
jalousies
of
the
lattice
which
screened
them
from
sight
among
the
prisoners
were
three
spanish
cavaliers
richly
dressed
they
were
in
the
flower
of
youth
and
of
noble
presence
and
the
lofty
manner
in
which
they
carried
themselves
though
loaded
with
chains
and
surrounded
with
enemies
bespoke
the
grandeur
of
their
souls
the
princesses
gazed
with
intense
and
breathless
interest
cooped
up
as
they
had
been
in
this
castle
among
female
attendants
seeing
nothing
of
the
male
sex
but
black
slaves
or
the
rude
fishermen
of
the
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
appearance
of
three
gallant
cavaliers
in
the
pride
of
youth
and
manly
beauty
should
produce
some
commotion
in
their
bosom
did
ever
nobler
being
tread
the
earth
than
that
cavalier
in
crimson
cried
zayda
the
eldest
of
the
sisters
see
how
proudly
he
bears
himself
as
though
all
around
him
were
his
slaves
but
notice
that
one
in
green
exclaimed
zorayda
what
grace
what
elegance
what
spirit
the
gentle
zorahayda
said
nothing
but
she
secretly
gave
preference
to
the
cavalier
in
blue
the
princesses
remained
gazing
until
the
prisoners
were
out
of
sight
then
heaving
sighs
they
turned
round
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
and
sat
down
musing
and
pensive
on
their
ottomans
the
discreet
kadiga
found
them
in
this
situation
they
related
what
they
had
seen
and
even
the
withered
heart
of
the
duenna
was
warmed
poor
youths
exclaimed
she
i
ll
warrant
their
captivity
makes
many
a
fair
and
lady
s
heart
ache
in
their
native
land
ah
my
children
you
have
little
idea
of
the
life
these
cavaliers
lead
in
their
own
country
such
prankling
at
tournaments
such
devotion
to
the
ladies
such
courting
and
serenading
the
curiosity
of
zayda
was
fully
aroused
she
was
insatiable
in
her
inquiries
and
drew
from
the
duenna
the
most
animated
pictures
of
the
scenes
of
her
youthful
days
and
native
land
the
beautiful
zorayda
bridled
up
and
slyly
regarded
herself
in
a
mirror
when
the
theme
turned
upon
the
charms
of
the
spanish
ladies
while
zorahayda
suppressed
a
struggling
sigh
at
the
mention
of
moonlight
serenades
every
day
the
curious
zayda
renewed
her
inquiries
and
every
day
the
sage
duenna
repeated
her
stories
which
were
listened
to
with
profound
interest
though
with
frequent
sighs
by
her
gentle
auditors
the
discreet
old
woman
awoke
at
length
to
the
mischief
she
might
be
doing
she
had
been
accustomed
to
think
of
the
princesses
only
as
children
but
they
had
imperceptibly
ripened
beneath
her
eye
and
now
bloomed
before
her
three
lovely
damsels
of
the
marriageable
age
it
is
time
thought
the
duenna
to
give
notice
to
the
king
mohamed
the
was
seated
one
morning
on
a
divan
in
a
cool
hall
of
the
alhambra
when
a
slave
arrived
from
the
fortress
of
salobreña
with
a
message
from
the
sage
kadiga
congratulating
him
on
the
anniversary
of
his
daughters
the
slave
at
the
same
time
presented
a
delicate
little
basket
decorated
with
flowers
within
which
on
a
couch
of
vine
and
lay
a
peach
an
apricot
and
a
nectarine
with
their
bloom
and
down
and
dewy
sweetness
upon
them
and
all
in
the
early
stage
of
tempting
ripeness
the
monarch
was
versed
in
the
oriental
language
of
fruits
and
flowers
and
rapidly
divined
the
meaning
of
this
emblematical
offering
so
said
he
the
critical
period
pointed
out
by
the
astrologers
is
arrived
my
daughters
are
at
a
marriageable
age
what
is
to
be
done
they
are
shut
up
from
the
eyes
of
men
they
are
under
the
eyes
of
the
discreet
kadiga
all
very
good
but
still
they
are
not
under
my
own
eye
as
was
prescribed
by
the
astrologers
i
must
gather
them
under
my
wing
and
trust
to
no
other
so
saying
he
ordered
that
a
tower
of
the
alhambra
should
be
prepared
for
their
reception
and
departed
at
the
head
of
his
guards
for
the
fortress
of
salobreña
to
conduct
them
home
in
person
about
three
years
had
elapsed
since
mohamed
had
beheld
his
daughters
and
he
could
scarcely
credit
his
eyes
at
the
wonderful
change
which
that
small
space
of
time
had
made
in
their
appearance
during
the
interval
they
had
passed
that
wondrous
boundary
line
in
female
life
which
separates
the
crude
unformed
and
thoughtless
girl
from
the
blooming
blushing
meditative
woman
it
is
like
passing
from
the
flat
bleak
uninteresting
plains
of
la
mancha
to
the
voluptuous
valleys
and
swelling
hills
of
andalusia
zayda
was
tall
and
finely
formed
with
a
lofty
demeanor
and
a
penetrating
eye
she
entered
with
a
stately
and
decided
step
and
made
a
profound
reverence
to
mohamed
treating
him
more
as
her
sovereign
than
her
father
zorayda
was
of
the
middle
height
with
an
alluring
look
and
swimming
gait
and
a
sparkling
beauty
heightened
by
the
assistance
of
the
toilette
she
approached
her
father
with
a
smile
kissed
his
hand
and
saluted
him
with
several
stanzas
from
a
popular
arabian
poet
with
which
the
monarch
was
delighted
zorahayda
was
shy
and
timid
smaller
than
her
sisters
and
with
a
beauty
of
that
tender
beseeching
kind
which
looks
for
fondness
and
protection
she
was
little
fitted
to
command
like
her
elder
sister
or
to
dazzle
like
the
second
but
was
rather
formed
to
creep
to
the
bosom
of
manly
affection
to
nestle
within
it
and
be
content
she
drew
near
to
her
father
with
a
timid
and
almost
faltering
step
and
would
have
taken
his
hand
to
kiss
but
on
looking
up
into
his
face
and
seeing
it
beaming
with
a
paternal
smile
the
tenderness
of
her
nature
broke
forth
and
she
threw
herself
upon
his
neck
mohamed
the
surveyed
his
blooming
daughters
with
mingled
pride
and
perplexity
for
while
he
exulted
in
their
charms
he
bethought
himself
of
the
prediction
of
the
astrologers
three
daughters
three
daughters
muttered
he
repeatedly
to
himself
and
all
of
a
marriageable
age
here
s
tempting
hesperian
fruit
that
requires
a
dragon
watch
he
prepared
for
his
return
to
granada
by
sending
heralds
before
him
commanding
every
one
to
keep
out
of
the
road
by
which
he
was
to
pass
and
that
all
doors
and
windows
should
be
closed
at
the
approach
of
the
princesses
this
done
he
set
forth
escorted
by
a
troop
of
black
horsemen
of
hideous
aspect
and
clad
in
shining
armor
the
princesses
rode
beside
the
king
closely
veiled
on
beautiful
white
palfreys
with
velvet
caparisons
embroidered
with
gold
and
sweeping
the
ground
the
bits
and
stirrups
were
of
gold
and
the
silken
bridles
adorned
with
pearls
and
precious
stones
the
palfreys
were
covered
with
little
silver
bells
which
made
the
most
musical
tinkling
as
they
ambled
gently
along
woe
to
the
unlucky
wight
however
who
lingered
in
the
way
when
he
heard
the
tinkling
of
these
bells
the
guards
were
ordered
to
cut
him
down
without
mercy
the
cavalcade
was
drawing
near
to
granada
when
it
overtook
on
the
banks
of
the
river
xenil
a
small
body
of
moorish
soldiers
with
a
convoy
of
prisoners
it
was
too
late
for
the
soldiers
to
get
out
of
the
way
so
they
threw
themselves
on
their
faces
on
the
earth
ordering
their
captives
to
do
the
like
among
the
prisoners
were
the
three
identical
cavaliers
whom
the
princesses
had
seen
from
the
pavilion
they
either
did
not
understand
or
were
too
haughty
to
obey
the
order
and
remained
standing
and
gazing
upon
the
cavalcade
as
it
approached
the
ire
of
the
monarch
was
kindled
at
this
flagrant
defiance
of
his
orders
drawing
his
cimeter
and
pressing
forward
he
was
about
to
deal
a
blow
that
might
have
been
fatal
to
at
least
one
of
the
gazers
when
the
princesses
crowded
round
him
and
implored
mercy
for
the
prisoners
even
the
timid
zorahayda
forgot
her
shyness
and
became
eloquent
in
their
behalf
mohamed
paused
with
uplifted
cimeter
when
the
captain
of
the
guard
threw
himself
at
his
feet
let
not
your
highness
said
he
do
a
deed
that
may
cause
great
scandal
throughout
the
kingdom
these
are
three
brave
and
noble
spanish
knights
who
have
been
taken
in
battle
fighting
like
lions
they
are
of
high
birth
and
may
bring
great
enough
said
the
king
i
will
spare
their
lives
but
punish
their
audacity
let
them
be
taken
to
the
vermilion
towers
and
put
to
hard
mohamed
was
making
one
of
his
usual
blunders
in
the
tumult
and
agitation
of
this
blustering
scene
the
veils
of
the
three
princesses
had
been
thrown
back
and
the
radiance
of
their
beauty
revealed
and
in
prolonging
the
parley
the
king
had
given
that
beauty
time
to
have
its
full
effect
in
those
days
people
fell
in
love
much
more
suddenly
than
at
present
as
all
ancient
stories
make
manifest
it
is
not
a
matter
of
wonder
therefore
that
the
hearts
of
the
three
cavaliers
were
completely
captured
especially
as
gratitude
was
added
to
their
admiration
it
is
a
little
singular
however
though
no
less
certain
that
each
of
them
was
enraptured
with
a
several
beauty
as
to
the
princesses
they
were
more
than
ever
struck
with
the
noble
demeanor
of
the
captives
and
cherished
in
their
breasts
all
that
they
had
heard
of
their
valor
and
noble
lineage
the
cavalcade
resumed
its
march
the
three
princesses
rode
pensively
along
on
their
tinkling
palfreys
now
and
then
stealing
a
glance
behind
in
search
of
the
christian
captives
and
the
latter
were
conducted
to
their
allotted
prison
in
the
vermilion
towers
the
residence
provided
for
the
princesses
was
one
of
the
most
dainty
that
fancy
could
devise
it
was
in
a
tower
somewhat
apart
from
the
main
palace
of
the
alhambra
though
connected
with
it
by
the
wall
which
encircled
the
whole
summit
of
the
hill
on
one
side
it
looked
into
the
interior
of
the
fortress
and
had
at
its
foot
a
small
garden
filled
with
the
rarest
flowers
on
the
other
side
it
overlooked
a
deep
embowered
ravine
separating
the
grounds
of
the
alhambra
from
those
of
the
generalife
the
interior
of
the
tower
was
divided
into
small
fairy
apartments
beautifully
ornamented
in
the
light
arabian
style
surrounding
a
lofty
hall
the
vaulted
roof
of
which
rose
almost
to
the
summit
of
the
tower
the
walls
and
the
ceilings
of
the
hall
were
adorned
with
arabesque
and
fretwork
sparkling
with
gold
and
with
brilliant
pencilling
in
the
centre
of
the
marble
pavement
was
an
alabaster
fountain
set
round
with
aromatic
shrubs
and
flowers
and
throwing
up
a
jet
of
water
that
cooled
the
whole
edifice
and
had
a
lulling
sound
round
the
hall
were
suspended
cages
of
gold
and
silver
wire
containing
singing
birds
of
the
finest
plumage
or
sweetest
note
the
princesses
had
been
represented
as
always
cheerful
when
in
the
castle
of
the
salobreña
the
king
had
expected
to
see
them
enraptured
with
the
alhambra
to
his
surprise
however
they
began
to
pine
and
grow
melancholy
and
dissatisfied
with
everything
around
them
the
flowers
yielded
them
no
fragrance
the
song
of
the
nightingale
disturbed
their
night
s
rest
and
they
were
out
of
all
patience
with
the
alabaster
fountain
with
its
eternal
and
from
morning
till
night
and
from
night
till
morning
the
king
who
was
somewhat
of
a
testy
tyrannical
disposition
took
this
at
first
in
high
dudgeon
but
he
reflected
that
his
daughters
had
arrived
at
an
age
when
the
female
mind
expands
and
its
desires
augment
they
are
no
longer
children
said
he
to
himself
they
are
women
grown
and
require
suitable
objects
to
interest
he
put
in
requisition
therefore
all
the
dressmakers
and
the
jewellers
and
the
artificers
in
gold
and
silver
throughout
the
zacatin
of
granada
and
the
princesses
were
overwhelmed
with
robes
of
silk
and
tissue
and
brocade
and
cashmere
shawls
and
necklaces
of
pearls
and
diamonds
and
rings
and
bracelets
and
anklets
and
all
manner
of
precious
things
all
however
was
of
no
avail
the
princesses
continued
pale
and
languid
in
the
midst
of
their
finery
and
looked
like
three
blighted
drooping
from
one
stalk
the
king
was
at
his
wits
end
he
had
in
general
a
laudable
confidence
in
his
own
judgment
and
never
took
advice
the
whims
and
caprices
of
three
marriageable
damsels
however
are
sufficient
said
he
to
puzzle
the
shrewdest
so
for
once
in
his
life
he
called
in
the
aid
of
counsel
the
person
to
whom
he
applied
was
the
experienced
duenna
kadiga
said
the
king
i
know
you
to
be
one
of
the
most
discreet
women
in
the
whole
world
as
well
as
one
of
the
most
trustworthy
for
these
reasons
i
have
always
continued
you
about
the
persons
of
my
daughters
fathers
can
not
be
too
wary
in
whom
they
repose
such
confidence
i
now
wish
you
to
find
out
the
secret
malady
that
is
preying
upon
the
princesses
and
to
devise
some
means
of
restoring
them
to
health
and
kadiga
promised
implicit
obedience
in
fact
she
knew
more
of
the
malady
of
the
princesses
than
they
themselves
shutting
herself
up
with
them
however
she
endeavored
to
insinuate
herself
into
their
confidence
my
dear
children
what
is
the
reason
you
are
so
dismal
and
downcast
in
so
beautiful
a
place
where
you
have
everything
that
heart
can
wish
the
princesses
looked
vacantly
round
the
apartment
and
sighed
what
more
then
would
you
have
shall
i
get
you
the
wonderful
parrot
that
talks
all
languages
and
is
the
delight
of
granada
odious
exclaimed
the
princess
zayda
a
horrid
screaming
bird
that
chatters
words
without
ideas
one
must
be
without
brains
to
tolerate
such
a
shall
i
send
for
a
monkey
from
the
rock
of
gibraltar
to
divert
you
with
his
antics
a
monkey
faugh
cried
zorayda
the
detestable
mimic
of
man
i
hate
the
nauseous
what
say
you
to
the
famous
black
singer
casem
from
the
royal
harem
in
morocco
they
say
he
has
a
voice
as
fine
as
a
woman
i
am
terrified
at
the
sight
of
these
black
slaves
said
the
delicate
zorahayda
besides
i
have
lost
all
relish
for
ah
my
child
you
would
not
say
so
replied
the
old
woman
slyly
had
you
heard
the
music
i
heard
last
evening
from
the
three
spanish
cavaliers
whom
we
met
on
our
journey
but
bless
me
children
what
is
the
matter
that
you
blush
so
and
are
in
such
a
flutter
nothing
nothing
good
mother
pray
well
as
i
was
passing
by
the
vermilion
towers
last
evening
i
saw
the
three
cavaliers
resting
after
their
day
s
labor
one
was
playing
on
the
guitar
so
gracefully
and
the
others
sang
by
turns
and
they
did
it
in
such
style
that
the
very
guards
seemed
like
statues
or
men
enchanted
allah
forgive
me
i
could
not
help
being
moved
at
hearing
the
songs
of
my
native
country
and
then
to
see
three
such
noble
and
handsome
youths
in
chains
and
slavery
here
the
old
woman
could
not
restrain
her
tears
perhaps
mother
you
could
manage
to
procure
us
a
sight
of
these
cavaliers
said
zayda
i
think
said
zorayda
a
little
music
would
be
quite
the
timid
zorahayda
said
nothing
but
threw
her
arms
round
the
neck
of
kadiga
mercy
on
me
exclaimed
the
discreet
old
woman
what
are
you
talking
of
my
children
your
father
would
be
the
death
of
us
all
if
he
heard
of
such
a
thing
to
be
sure
these
cavaliers
are
evidently
and
youths
but
what
of
that
they
are
the
enemies
of
our
faith
and
you
must
not
even
think
of
them
but
with
there
is
an
admirable
intrepidity
in
the
female
will
particularly
when
about
the
marriageable
age
which
is
not
to
be
deterred
by
dangers
and
prohibitions
the
princesses
hung
round
their
old
duenna
and
coaxed
and
entreated
and
declared
that
a
refusal
would
break
their
hearts
what
could
she
do
she
was
certainly
the
most
discreet
old
woman
in
the
whole
world
and
one
of
the
most
faithful
servants
to
the
king
but
was
she
to
see
three
beautiful
princesses
break
their
hearts
for
the
mere
tinkling
of
a
guitar
besides
though
she
had
been
so
long
among
the
moors
and
changed
her
faith
in
imitation
of
her
mistress
like
a
trusty
follower
yet
she
was
a
spaniard
born
and
had
the
lingerings
of
christianity
in
her
heart
so
she
set
about
to
contrive
how
the
wish
of
the
princesses
might
be
gratified
the
christian
captives
confined
in
the
vermilion
towers
were
under
the
charge
of
a
renegado
called
hussein
baba
who
was
reputed
to
have
a
most
itching
palm
she
went
to
him
privately
and
slipping
a
broad
piece
of
gold
into
his
hand
hussein
baba
said
she
my
mistresses
the
three
princesses
who
are
shut
up
in
the
tower
and
in
sad
want
of
amusement
have
heard
of
the
musical
talents
of
the
three
spanish
cavaliers
and
are
desirous
of
hearing
a
specimen
of
their
skill
i
am
sure
you
are
too
to
refuse
them
so
innocent
a
what
and
to
have
my
head
set
grinning
over
the
gate
of
my
own
tower
for
that
would
be
the
reward
if
the
king
should
discover
no
danger
of
anything
of
the
kind
the
affair
may
be
managed
so
that
the
whim
of
the
princesses
may
be
gratified
and
their
father
be
never
the
wiser
you
know
the
deep
ravine
outside
of
the
walls
which
passes
immediately
below
the
tower
put
the
three
christians
to
work
there
and
at
the
intervals
of
their
labor
let
them
play
and
sing
as
if
for
their
own
recreation
in
this
way
the
princesses
will
be
able
to
hear
them
from
the
windows
of
the
tower
and
you
may
be
sure
of
their
paying
well
for
your
as
the
good
old
woman
concluded
her
harangue
she
kindly
pressed
the
rough
hand
of
the
renegado
and
left
within
it
another
piece
of
gold
her
eloquence
was
irresistible
the
very
next
day
the
three
cavaliers
were
put
to
work
in
the
ravine
during
the
noontide
heat
when
their
were
sleeping
in
the
shade
and
the
guard
nodding
drowsily
at
his
post
they
seated
themselves
among
the
herbage
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
and
sang
a
spanish
roundelay
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
guitar
the
glen
was
deep
the
tower
was
high
but
their
voices
rose
distinctly
in
the
stillness
of
the
summer
noon
the
princesses
listened
from
their
balcony
they
had
been
taught
the
spanish
language
by
their
duenna
and
were
moved
by
the
tenderness
of
the
song
the
discreet
kadiga
on
the
contrary
was
terribly
shocked
allah
preserve
us
cried
she
they
are
singing
a
addressed
to
yourselves
did
ever
mortal
hear
of
such
audacity
i
will
run
to
the
and
have
them
soundly
what
bastinado
such
gallant
cavaliers
and
for
singing
so
charmingly
the
three
beautiful
princesses
were
filled
with
horror
at
the
idea
with
all
her
virtuous
indignation
the
good
old
woman
was
of
a
placable
nature
and
easily
appeased
besides
the
music
seemed
to
have
a
beneficial
effect
upon
her
young
mistresses
a
rosy
bloom
had
already
come
to
their
cheeks
and
their
eyes
began
to
sparkle
she
made
no
further
objection
therefore
to
the
amorous
ditty
of
the
cavaliers
when
it
was
finished
the
princesses
remained
silent
for
a
time
at
length
zorayda
took
up
a
lute
and
with
a
sweet
though
faint
and
trembling
voice
warbled
a
little
arabian
air
the
burden
of
which
was
the
rose
is
concealed
among
her
leaves
but
she
listens
with
delight
to
the
song
of
the
from
this
time
forward
the
cavaliers
worked
almost
daily
in
the
ravine
the
considerate
hussein
baba
became
more
and
more
indulgent
and
daily
more
prone
to
sleep
at
his
post
for
some
time
a
vague
intercourse
was
kept
up
by
popular
songs
and
romances
which
in
some
measure
responded
to
each
other
and
breathed
the
feelings
of
the
parties
by
degrees
the
princesses
showed
themselves
at
the
balcony
when
they
could
do
so
without
being
perceived
by
the
guards
they
conversed
with
the
cavaliers
also
by
means
of
flowers
with
the
symbolical
language
of
which
they
were
mutually
acquainted
the
difficulties
of
their
intercourse
added
to
its
charms
and
strengthened
the
passion
they
had
so
singularly
conceived
for
love
delights
to
struggle
with
difficulties
and
thrives
the
most
hardily
on
the
scantiest
soil
the
change
effected
in
the
looks
and
spirits
of
the
princesses
by
this
secret
intercourse
surprised
and
gratified
the
king
but
no
one
was
more
elated
than
the
discreet
kadiga
who
considered
it
all
owing
to
her
able
management
at
length
there
was
an
interruption
in
this
telegraphic
correspondence
for
several
days
the
cavaliers
ceased
to
make
their
appearance
in
the
glen
the
princesses
looked
out
from
the
tower
in
vain
in
vain
they
stretched
their
necks
from
the
balcony
in
vain
they
sang
like
captive
nightingales
in
their
cage
nothing
was
to
be
seen
of
their
christian
lovers
not
a
note
responded
from
the
groves
the
discreet
kadiga
sallied
forth
in
quest
of
intelligence
and
soon
returned
with
a
face
full
of
trouble
ah
my
children
cried
she
i
saw
what
all
this
would
come
to
but
you
would
have
your
way
you
may
now
hang
up
your
lutes
on
the
willows
the
spanish
cavaliers
are
ransomed
by
their
families
they
are
down
in
granada
and
preparing
to
return
to
their
native
the
three
beautiful
princesses
were
in
despair
at
the
tidings
zayda
was
indignant
at
the
slight
put
upon
them
in
thus
being
deserted
without
a
parting
word
zorayda
wrung
her
hands
and
cried
and
looked
in
the
glass
and
wiped
away
her
tears
and
cried
afresh
the
gentle
zorahayda
leaned
over
the
balcony
and
wept
in
silence
and
her
tears
fell
drop
by
drop
among
the
flowers
of
the
bank
where
the
faithless
cavaliers
had
so
often
been
seated
the
discreet
kadiga
did
all
in
her
power
to
soothe
their
sorrow
take
comfort
my
children
said
she
this
is
nothing
when
you
are
used
to
it
this
is
the
way
of
the
world
ah
when
you
are
as
old
as
i
am
you
will
know
how
to
value
these
men
i
ll
warrant
these
cavaliers
have
their
loves
among
the
spanish
beauties
of
cordova
and
seville
and
will
soon
be
serenading
under
their
balconies
and
thinking
no
more
of
the
moorish
beauties
in
the
alhambra
take
comfort
therefore
my
children
and
drive
them
from
your
the
comforting
words
of
the
discreet
kadiga
only
redoubled
the
distress
of
the
three
princesses
and
for
two
days
they
continued
inconsolable
on
the
morning
of
the
third
the
good
old
woman
entered
their
apartment
all
ruffling
with
indignation
who
would
have
believed
such
insolence
in
mortal
man
exclaimed
she
as
soon
as
she
could
find
words
to
express
herself
but
i
am
rightly
served
for
having
connived
at
this
deception
of
your
worthy
father
never
talk
more
to
me
of
your
spanish
why
what
has
happened
good
kadiga
exclaimed
the
princesses
in
breathless
anxiety
what
has
happened
treason
has
happened
or
what
is
almost
as
bad
treason
has
been
proposed
and
to
me
the
most
faithful
of
subjects
the
trustiest
of
duennas
yes
my
children
the
spanish
cavaliers
have
dared
to
tamper
with
me
that
i
should
persuade
you
to
fly
with
them
to
cordova
and
become
their
wives
here
the
excellent
old
woman
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
gave
way
to
a
violent
burst
of
grief
and
indignation
the
three
beautiful
princesses
turned
pale
and
red
pale
and
red
and
trembled
and
looked
down
and
cast
shy
looks
at
each
other
but
said
nothing
meantime
the
old
woman
sat
rocking
backward
and
forward
in
violent
agitation
and
now
and
then
breaking
out
into
exclamations
that
ever
i
should
live
to
be
so
insulted
i
the
most
faithful
of
servants
at
length
the
eldest
princess
who
had
most
spirit
and
always
took
the
lead
approached
her
and
laying
her
hand
upon
her
shoulder
well
mother
said
she
supposing
we
were
willing
to
fly
with
these
christian
cavaliers
is
such
a
thing
possible
the
good
old
woman
paused
suddenly
in
her
grief
and
looking
up
possible
echoed
she
to
be
sure
it
is
possible
have
not
the
cavaliers
already
bribed
hussein
baba
the
renegado
captain
of
the
guard
and
arranged
the
whole
plan
but
then
to
think
of
deceiving
your
father
your
father
who
has
placed
such
confidence
in
me
here
the
worthy
woman
gave
way
to
a
fresh
burst
of
grief
and
began
again
to
rock
backward
and
forward
and
to
wring
her
hands
but
our
father
has
never
placed
any
confidence
in
us
said
the
eldest
princess
but
has
trusted
to
bolts
and
bars
and
treated
us
as
why
that
is
true
enough
replied
the
old
woman
again
pausing
in
her
grief
he
has
indeed
treated
you
most
unreasonably
keeping
you
shut
up
here
to
waste
your
bloom
in
a
moping
old
tower
like
roses
left
to
wither
in
a
but
then
to
fly
from
your
native
land
and
is
not
the
land
we
fly
to
the
native
land
of
our
mother
where
we
shall
live
in
freedom
and
shall
we
not
each
have
a
youthful
husband
in
exchange
for
a
severe
old
father
why
that
again
is
all
very
true
and
your
father
i
must
confess
is
rather
tyrannical
but
what
then
relapsing
into
her
grief
would
you
leave
me
behind
to
bear
the
brunt
of
his
vengeance
by
no
means
my
good
kadiga
can
not
you
fly
with
us
very
true
my
child
and
to
tell
the
truth
when
i
talked
the
matter
over
with
hussein
baba
he
promised
to
take
care
of
me
if
i
would
accompany
you
in
your
flight
but
then
bethink
you
my
children
are
you
willing
to
renounce
the
faith
of
your
father
the
christian
faith
was
the
original
faith
of
our
mother
said
the
eldest
princess
i
am
ready
to
embrace
it
and
so
i
am
sure
are
my
right
again
exclaimed
the
old
woman
brightening
up
it
was
the
original
faith
of
your
mother
and
bitterly
did
she
lament
on
her
that
she
had
renounced
it
i
promised
her
then
to
take
care
of
your
souls
and
i
rejoice
to
see
that
they
are
now
in
a
fair
way
to
be
saved
yes
my
children
i
too
was
born
a
christian
and
have
remained
a
christian
in
my
heart
and
am
resolved
to
return
to
the
faith
i
have
talked
on
the
subject
with
hussein
baba
who
is
a
spaniard
by
birth
and
comes
from
a
place
not
far
from
my
native
town
he
is
equally
anxious
to
see
his
own
country
and
to
be
reconciled
to
the
church
and
the
cavaliers
have
promised
that
if
we
are
disposed
to
become
man
and
wife
on
returning
to
our
native
land
they
will
provide
for
us
in
a
word
it
appeared
that
this
extremely
discreet
and
provident
old
woman
had
consulted
with
the
cavaliers
and
the
renegado
and
had
concerted
the
whole
plan
of
escape
the
eldest
princess
immediately
assented
to
it
and
her
example
as
usual
determined
the
conduct
of
her
sisters
it
is
true
the
youngest
hesitated
for
she
was
gentle
and
timid
of
soul
and
there
was
a
struggle
in
her
bosom
between
filial
feeling
and
youthful
passion
the
latter
however
as
usual
gained
the
victory
and
with
silent
tears
and
stifled
sighs
she
prepared
herself
for
flight
the
rugged
hill
on
which
the
alhambra
is
built
was
in
old
times
perforated
with
subterranean
passages
cut
through
the
rock
and
leading
from
the
fortress
to
various
parts
of
the
city
and
to
distant
on
the
banks
of
the
darro
and
the
xenil
they
had
been
constructed
at
different
times
by
the
moorish
kings
as
means
of
escape
from
sudden
insurrections
or
of
secretly
issuing
forth
on
private
enterprises
many
of
them
are
now
entirely
lost
while
others
remain
partly
choked
with
rubbish
and
partly
walled
up
monuments
of
the
jealous
precautions
and
warlike
stratagems
of
the
moorish
government
by
one
of
these
passages
hussein
baba
had
undertaken
to
conduct
the
princesses
to
a
beyond
the
walls
of
the
city
where
the
cavaliers
were
to
be
ready
with
fleet
steeds
to
bear
the
whole
party
over
the
borders
the
appointed
night
arrived
the
tower
of
the
princesses
had
been
locked
up
as
usual
and
the
alhambra
was
buried
in
deep
sleep
towards
midnight
the
discreet
kadiga
listened
from
the
balcony
of
a
window
that
looked
into
the
garden
hussein
baba
the
renegado
was
already
below
and
gave
the
appointed
signal
the
duenna
fastened
the
end
of
a
ladder
of
ropes
to
the
balcony
lowered
it
into
the
garden
and
descended
the
two
eldest
princesses
followed
her
with
beating
hearts
but
when
it
came
to
the
turn
of
the
youngest
princess
zorahayda
she
hesitated
and
trembled
several
times
she
ventured
a
delicate
little
foot
upon
the
ladder
and
as
often
drew
it
back
while
her
poor
little
heart
fluttered
more
and
more
the
longer
she
delayed
she
cast
a
wistful
look
back
into
the
silken
chamber
she
had
lived
in
it
to
be
sure
like
a
bird
in
a
cage
but
within
it
she
was
secure
who
could
tell
what
dangers
might
beset
her
should
she
flutter
forth
into
the
wide
world
now
she
bethought
her
of
her
gallant
christian
lover
and
her
little
foot
was
instantly
upon
the
ladder
and
anon
she
thought
of
her
father
and
shrank
back
but
fruitless
is
the
attempt
to
describe
the
conflict
in
the
bosom
of
one
so
young
and
tender
and
loving
but
so
timid
and
so
ignorant
of
the
world
in
vain
her
sisters
implored
the
duenna
scolded
and
the
renegado
blasphemed
beneath
the
balcony
the
gentle
little
moorish
maid
stood
doubting
and
wavering
on
the
verge
of
elopement
tempted
by
the
sweetness
of
the
sin
but
terrified
at
its
perils
every
moment
increased
the
danger
of
discovery
a
distant
tramp
was
heard
the
patrols
are
walking
their
rounds
cried
the
renegado
if
we
linger
we
perish
princess
descend
instantly
or
we
leave
zorahayda
was
for
a
moment
in
fearful
agitation
then
loosening
the
ladder
of
ropes
with
desperate
resolution
she
flung
it
from
the
balcony
it
is
decided
cried
she
flight
is
now
out
of
my
power
allah
guide
and
bless
ye
my
dear
sisters
the
two
eldest
princesses
were
shocked
at
the
thoughts
of
leaving
her
behind
and
would
fain
have
lingered
but
the
patrol
was
advancing
the
renegado
was
furious
and
they
were
hurried
away
to
the
subterraneous
passage
they
groped
their
way
through
a
fearful
labyrinth
cut
through
the
heart
of
the
mountain
and
succeeded
in
reaching
undiscovered
an
iron
gate
that
opened
outside
of
the
walls
the
spanish
cavaliers
were
waiting
to
receive
them
disguised
as
moorish
soldiers
of
the
guard
commanded
by
the
renegado
the
lover
of
zorahayda
was
frantic
when
he
learned
that
she
had
refused
to
leave
the
tower
but
there
was
no
time
to
waste
in
lamentations
the
two
princesses
were
placed
behind
their
lovers
the
discreet
kadiga
mounted
behind
the
renegado
and
they
all
set
off
at
a
round
pace
in
the
direction
of
the
pass
of
lope
which
leads
through
the
mountains
towards
cordova
they
had
not
proceeded
far
when
they
heard
the
noise
of
drums
and
trumpets
from
the
battlements
of
the
alhambra
our
flight
is
discovered
said
the
renegado
we
have
fleet
steeds
the
night
is
dark
and
we
may
distance
all
pursuit
replied
the
cavaliers
they
put
spurs
to
their
horses
and
scoured
across
the
vega
they
attained
the
foot
of
the
mountain
of
elvira
which
stretches
like
a
promontory
into
the
plain
the
renegado
paused
and
listened
as
yet
said
he
there
is
no
one
on
our
traces
we
shall
make
good
our
escape
to
the
while
he
spoke
a
light
blaze
sprang
up
on
the
top
of
the
of
the
alhambra
confusion
cried
the
renegado
that
bale
fire
will
put
all
the
guards
of
the
passes
on
the
alert
away
away
spur
like
mad
there
is
no
time
to
be
away
they
dashed
the
clattering
of
their
horses
hoofs
echoed
from
rock
to
rock
as
they
swept
along
the
road
that
skirts
the
rocky
mountain
of
elvira
as
they
galloped
on
the
bale
fire
of
the
alhambra
was
answered
in
every
direction
light
after
light
blazed
on
the
atalayas
or
of
the
mountains
forward
forward
cried
the
renegado
with
many
an
oath
to
the
bridge
to
the
bridge
before
the
alarm
has
reached
there
they
doubled
the
promontory
of
the
mountains
and
arrived
in
sight
of
the
famous
bridge
of
pinos
that
crosses
a
rushing
stream
often
dyed
with
christian
and
moslem
blood
to
their
confusion
the
tower
on
the
bridge
blazed
with
lights
and
glittered
with
armed
men
the
renegado
pulled
up
his
steed
rose
in
his
stirrups
and
looked
about
him
for
a
moment
then
beckoning
to
the
cavaliers
he
struck
off
from
the
road
skirted
the
river
for
some
distance
and
dashed
into
its
waters
the
cavaliers
called
upon
the
princesses
to
cling
to
them
and
did
the
same
they
were
borne
for
some
distance
down
the
rapid
current
the
surges
roared
round
them
but
the
beautiful
princesses
clung
to
their
christian
knights
and
never
uttered
a
complaint
the
cavaliers
attained
the
opposite
bank
in
safety
and
were
conducted
by
the
renegado
by
rude
and
unfrequented
paths
and
wild
barrancos
through
the
heart
of
the
mountains
so
as
to
avoid
all
the
regular
passes
in
a
word
they
succeeded
in
reaching
the
ancient
city
of
cordova
where
their
restoration
to
their
country
and
friends
was
celebrated
with
great
rejoicings
for
they
were
of
the
noblest
families
the
beautiful
princesses
were
forthwith
received
into
the
bosom
of
the
church
and
after
being
in
all
due
form
made
regular
christians
were
rendered
happy
wives
in
our
hurry
to
make
good
the
escape
of
the
princesses
across
the
river
and
up
the
mountains
we
forgot
to
mention
the
fate
of
the
discreet
kadiga
she
had
clung
like
a
cat
to
hussein
baba
in
the
scamper
across
the
vega
screaming
at
every
bound
and
drawing
many
an
oath
from
the
whiskered
renegado
but
when
he
prepared
to
plunge
his
steed
into
the
river
her
terror
knew
no
bounds
grasp
me
not
so
tightly
cried
hussein
baba
hold
on
by
my
belt
and
fear
she
held
firmly
with
both
hands
by
the
leathern
belt
that
girded
the
renegado
but
when
he
halted
with
the
cavaliers
to
take
breath
on
the
mountain
summit
the
duenna
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
what
has
become
of
kadiga
cried
the
princesses
in
alarm
allah
alone
knows
replied
the
renegado
my
belt
came
loose
when
in
the
midst
of
the
river
and
kadiga
was
swept
with
it
down
the
stream
the
will
of
allah
be
done
but
it
was
an
embroidered
belt
and
of
great
there
was
no
time
to
waste
in
idle
regrets
yet
bitterly
did
the
princesses
bewail
the
loss
of
their
discreet
counsellor
that
excellent
old
woman
however
did
not
lose
more
than
half
of
her
nine
lives
in
the
water
a
fisherman
who
was
drawing
his
nets
some
distance
down
the
stream
brought
her
to
land
and
was
not
a
little
astonished
at
his
miraculous
draught
what
further
became
of
the
discreet
kadiga
the
legend
does
not
mention
certain
it
is
that
she
evinced
her
discretion
in
never
venturing
within
the
reach
of
mohamed
the
almost
as
little
is
known
of
the
conduct
of
that
sagacious
monarch
when
he
discovered
the
escape
of
his
daughters
and
the
deceit
practised
upon
him
by
the
most
faithful
of
servants
it
was
the
only
instance
in
which
he
had
called
in
the
aid
of
counsel
and
he
was
never
afterwards
known
to
be
guilty
of
a
similar
weakness
he
took
good
care
however
to
guard
his
remaining
daughter
who
had
no
disposition
to
elope
it
is
thought
indeed
that
she
secretly
repented
having
remained
behind
now
and
then
she
was
seen
leaning
on
the
battlements
of
the
tower
and
looking
mournfully
towards
the
mountains
in
the
direction
of
cordova
and
sometimes
the
notes
of
her
lute
were
heard
accompanying
plaintive
ditties
in
which
she
was
said
to
lament
the
loss
of
her
sisters
and
her
lover
and
to
bewail
her
solitary
life
she
died
young
and
according
to
popular
rumor
was
buried
in
a
vault
beneath
the
tower
and
her
untimely
fate
has
given
rise
to
more
than
one
traditionary
fable
the
following
legend
which
seems
in
some
measure
to
spring
out
of
the
foregoing
story
is
too
closely
connected
with
high
historic
names
to
be
entirely
doubted
the
count
s
daughter
and
some
of
her
young
companions
to
whom
it
was
read
in
one
of
the
evening
tertulias
thought
certain
parts
of
it
had
much
appearance
of
reality
and
dolores
who
was
much
more
versed
than
they
in
the
improbable
truths
of
the
alhambra
believed
every
word
of
it
legend
of
the
rose
of
the
alhambra
for
some
time
after
the
surrender
of
granada
by
the
moors
that
delightful
city
was
a
frequent
and
favorite
residence
of
the
spanish
sovereigns
until
they
were
frightened
away
by
successive
shocks
of
earthquakes
which
toppled
down
various
houses
and
made
the
old
moslem
towers
rock
to
their
foundation
many
many
years
then
rolled
away
during
which
granada
was
rarely
honored
by
a
royal
guest
the
palaces
of
the
nobility
remained
silent
and
shut
up
and
the
alhambra
like
a
slighted
beauty
sat
in
mournful
desolation
among
her
neglected
gardens
the
tower
of
the
infantas
once
the
residence
of
the
three
beautiful
moorish
princesses
partook
of
the
general
desolation
the
spider
spun
her
web
athwart
the
gilded
vault
and
bats
and
owls
nestled
in
those
chambers
that
had
been
graced
by
the
presence
of
zayda
zorayda
and
zorahayda
the
neglect
of
this
tower
may
have
been
partly
owing
to
some
superstitious
notions
of
the
neighbors
it
was
rumored
that
the
spirit
of
the
youthful
zorahayda
who
had
perished
in
that
tower
was
often
seen
by
moonlight
seated
beside
the
fountain
in
the
hall
or
moaning
about
the
battlements
and
that
the
notes
of
her
silver
lute
would
be
heard
at
midnight
by
wayfarers
passing
along
the
glen
at
length
the
city
of
granada
was
once
more
welcomed
by
the
royal
presence
all
the
world
knows
that
philip
was
the
first
bourbon
that
swayed
the
spanish
sceptre
all
the
world
knows
that
he
married
in
second
nuptials
elizabetta
or
isabella
for
they
are
the
same
the
beautiful
princess
of
parma
and
all
the
world
knows
that
by
this
chain
of
contingencies
a
french
prince
and
an
italian
princess
were
seated
together
on
the
spanish
throne
for
a
visit
of
this
illustrious
pair
the
alhambra
was
repaired
and
fitted
up
with
all
possible
expedition
the
arrival
of
the
court
changed
the
whole
aspect
of
the
lately
deserted
palace
the
clangor
of
drum
and
trumpet
the
tramp
of
steed
about
the
avenues
and
outer
court
the
glitter
of
arms
and
display
of
banners
about
barbican
and
battlement
recalled
the
ancient
and
warlike
glories
of
the
fortress
a
softer
spirit
however
reigned
within
the
royal
palace
there
was
the
rustling
of
robes
and
the
cautious
tread
and
murmuring
voice
of
reverential
courtiers
about
the
antechambers
a
loitering
of
pages
and
maids
of
honor
about
the
gardens
and
the
sound
of
music
stealing
from
open
casements
among
those
who
attended
in
the
train
of
the
monarchs
was
a
favorite
page
of
the
queen
named
ruyz
de
alarcon
to
say
that
he
was
a
favorite
page
of
the
queen
was
at
once
to
speak
his
eulogium
for
every
one
in
the
suite
of
the
stately
elizabetta
was
chosen
for
grace
and
beauty
and
accomplishments
he
was
just
turned
of
eighteen
light
and
lithe
of
form
and
graceful
as
a
young
antinous
to
the
queen
he
was
all
deference
and
respect
yet
he
was
at
heart
a
roguish
stripling
petted
and
spoiled
by
the
ladies
about
the
court
and
experienced
in
the
ways
of
women
far
beyond
his
years
this
loitering
page
was
one
morning
rambling
about
the
groves
of
the
generalife
which
overlook
the
grounds
of
the
alhambra
he
had
taken
with
him
for
his
amusement
a
favorite
of
the
queen
in
the
course
of
his
rambles
seeing
a
bird
rising
from
a
thicket
he
unhooded
the
hawk
and
let
him
fly
the
falcon
towered
high
in
the
air
made
a
swoop
at
his
quarry
but
missing
it
soared
away
regardless
of
the
calls
of
the
page
the
latter
followed
the
truant
bird
with
his
eye
in
its
capricious
flight
until
he
saw
it
alight
upon
the
battlements
of
a
remote
and
lonely
tower
in
the
outer
wall
of
the
alhambra
built
on
the
edge
of
a
ravine
that
separated
the
royal
fortress
from
the
grounds
of
the
generalife
it
was
in
fact
the
tower
of
the
the
page
descended
into
the
ravine
and
approached
the
tower
but
it
had
no
entrance
from
the
glen
and
its
lofty
height
rendered
any
attempt
to
scale
it
fruitless
seeking
one
of
the
gates
of
the
fortress
therefore
he
made
a
wide
circuit
to
that
side
of
the
tower
facing
within
the
walls
a
small
garden
enclosed
by
a
of
reeds
overhung
with
myrtle
lay
before
the
tower
opening
a
wicket
the
page
passed
between
beds
of
flowers
and
thickets
of
roses
to
the
door
it
was
closed
and
bolted
a
crevice
in
the
door
gave
him
a
peep
into
the
interior
there
was
a
small
moorish
hall
with
fretted
walls
light
marble
columns
and
an
alabaster
fountain
surrounded
with
flowers
in
the
centre
hung
a
gilt
cage
containing
a
beneath
it
on
a
chair
lay
a
cat
among
reels
of
silk
and
other
articles
of
female
labor
and
a
guitar
decorated
with
ribbons
leaned
against
the
fountain
ruyz
de
alarcon
was
struck
with
these
traces
of
female
taste
and
elegance
in
a
lonely
and
as
he
had
supposed
deserted
tower
they
reminded
him
of
the
tales
of
enchanted
halls
current
in
the
alhambra
and
the
cat
might
be
some
princess
he
knocked
gently
at
the
door
a
beautiful
face
peeped
out
from
a
little
window
above
but
was
instantly
withdrawn
he
waited
expecting
that
the
door
would
be
opened
but
he
waited
in
vain
no
footstep
was
to
be
heard
within
all
was
silent
had
his
senses
deceived
him
or
was
this
beautiful
apparition
the
fairy
of
the
tower
he
knocked
again
and
more
loudly
after
a
little
while
the
beaming
face
once
more
peeped
forth
it
was
that
of
a
blooming
damsel
of
fifteen
the
page
immediately
doffed
his
plumed
bonnet
and
entreated
in
the
most
courteous
accents
to
be
permitted
to
ascend
the
tower
in
pursuit
of
his
falcon
i
dare
not
open
the
door
señor
replied
the
little
damsel
blushing
my
aunt
has
forbidden
i
do
beseech
you
fair
maid
it
is
the
favorite
falcon
of
the
queen
i
dare
not
return
to
the
palace
without
are
you
then
one
of
the
cavaliers
of
the
court
i
am
fair
maid
but
i
shall
lose
the
queen
s
favor
and
my
place
if
i
lose
this
santa
maria
it
is
against
you
cavaliers
of
the
court
my
aunt
has
charged
me
especially
to
bar
the
against
wicked
cavaliers
doubtless
but
i
am
none
of
these
but
a
simple
harmless
page
who
will
be
ruined
and
undone
if
you
deny
me
this
small
the
heart
of
the
little
damsel
was
touched
by
the
distress
of
the
page
it
was
a
thousand
pities
he
should
be
ruined
for
the
want
of
so
trifling
a
boon
surely
too
he
could
not
be
one
of
those
dangerous
beings
whom
her
aunt
had
described
as
a
species
of
cannibal
ever
on
the
prowl
to
make
prey
of
thoughtless
damsels
he
was
gentle
and
modest
and
stood
so
entreatingly
with
cap
in
hand
and
looked
so
charming
the
sly
page
saw
that
the
garrison
began
to
waver
and
redoubled
his
entreaties
in
such
moving
terms
that
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
mortal
maiden
to
deny
him
so
the
blushing
little
warden
of
the
tower
descended
and
opened
the
door
with
a
trembling
hand
and
if
the
page
had
been
charmed
by
a
mere
glimpse
of
her
countenance
from
the
window
he
was
ravished
by
the
portrait
now
revealed
to
him
her
andalusian
bodice
and
trim
basquiña
set
off
the
round
but
delicate
symmetry
of
her
form
which
was
as
yet
scarce
verging
into
womanhood
her
glossy
hair
was
parted
on
her
forehead
with
scrupulous
exactness
and
decorated
with
a
fresh
plucked
rose
according
to
the
universal
custom
of
the
country
it
is
true
her
complexion
was
tinged
by
the
ardor
of
a
southern
sun
but
it
served
to
give
richness
to
the
mantling
bloom
of
her
cheek
and
to
heighten
the
lustre
of
her
melting
eyes
ruyz
de
alarcon
beheld
all
this
with
a
single
glance
for
it
became
him
not
to
tarry
he
merely
murmured
his
acknowledgments
and
then
bounded
lightly
up
the
spiral
staircase
in
quest
of
his
falcon
he
soon
returned
with
the
truant
bird
upon
his
fist
the
damsel
in
the
mean
time
had
seated
herself
by
the
fountain
in
the
hall
and
was
winding
silk
but
in
her
agitation
she
let
fall
the
reel
upon
the
pavement
the
page
sprang
and
picked
it
up
then
dropping
gracefully
on
one
knee
presented
it
to
her
but
seizing
the
hand
extended
to
receive
it
imprinted
on
it
a
kiss
more
fervent
and
devout
than
he
had
ever
imprinted
on
the
fair
hand
of
his
sovereign
ave
maria
señor
exclaimed
the
damsel
blushing
still
deeper
with
confusion
and
surprise
for
never
before
had
she
received
such
a
salutation
the
modest
page
made
a
thousand
apologies
assuring
her
it
was
the
way
at
court
of
expressing
the
most
profound
homage
and
respect
her
anger
if
anger
she
felt
was
easily
pacified
but
her
agitation
and
embarrassment
continued
and
she
sat
blushing
deeper
and
deeper
with
her
eyes
cast
down
upon
her
work
entangling
the
silk
which
she
attempted
to
wind
the
cunning
page
saw
the
confusion
in
the
opposite
camp
and
would
fain
have
profited
by
it
but
the
fine
speeches
he
would
have
uttered
died
upon
his
lips
his
attempts
at
gallantry
were
awkward
and
ineffectual
and
to
his
surprise
the
adroit
page
who
had
figured
with
such
grace
and
effrontery
among
the
most
knowing
and
experienced
ladies
of
the
court
found
himself
awed
and
abashed
in
the
presence
of
a
simple
damsel
of
fifteen
in
fact
the
artless
maiden
in
her
own
modesty
and
innocence
had
guardians
more
effectual
than
the
bolts
and
bars
prescribed
by
her
vigilant
aunt
still
where
is
the
female
bosom
proof
against
the
first
whisperings
of
love
the
little
damsel
with
all
her
artlessness
instinctively
comprehended
all
that
the
faltering
tongue
of
the
page
failed
to
express
and
her
heart
was
fluttered
at
beholding
for
the
first
time
a
lover
at
her
feet
and
such
a
lover
the
diffidence
of
the
page
though
genuine
was
and
he
was
recovering
his
usual
ease
and
confidence
when
a
shrill
voice
was
heard
at
a
distance
my
aunt
is
returning
from
mass
cried
the
damsel
in
affright
i
pray
you
señor
not
until
you
grant
me
that
rose
from
your
hair
as
a
she
hastily
untwisted
the
rose
from
her
raven
locks
take
it
cried
she
agitated
and
blushing
but
pray
the
page
took
the
rose
and
at
the
same
time
covered
with
kisses
the
fair
hand
that
gave
it
then
placing
the
flower
in
his
bonnet
and
taking
the
falcon
upon
his
fist
he
bounded
off
through
the
garden
bearing
away
with
him
the
heart
of
the
gentle
jacinta
when
the
vigilant
aunt
arrived
at
the
tower
she
remarked
the
agitation
of
her
niece
and
an
air
of
confusion
in
the
hall
but
a
word
of
explanation
sufficed
a
had
pursued
his
prey
into
the
mercy
on
us
to
think
of
a
falcon
flying
into
the
tower
did
ever
one
hear
of
so
saucy
a
hawk
why
the
very
bird
in
the
cage
is
not
safe
the
vigilant
fredegonda
was
one
of
the
most
wary
of
ancient
spinsters
she
had
a
becoming
terror
and
distrust
of
what
she
denominated
the
opposite
sex
which
had
gradually
increased
through
a
long
life
of
celibacy
not
that
the
good
lady
had
ever
suffered
from
their
wiles
nature
having
set
up
a
safeguard
in
her
face
that
forbade
all
trespass
upon
her
premises
but
ladies
who
have
least
cause
to
fear
for
themselves
are
most
ready
to
keep
a
watch
over
their
more
tempting
neighbors
the
niece
was
an
orphan
of
an
officer
who
had
fallen
in
the
wars
she
had
been
educated
in
a
convent
and
had
recently
been
transferred
from
her
sacred
asylum
to
the
immediate
guardianship
of
her
aunt
under
whose
overshadowing
care
she
vegetated
in
obscurity
like
an
opening
rose
blooming
beneath
a
brier
nor
indeed
is
this
comparison
entirely
accidental
for
to
tell
the
truth
her
fresh
and
dawning
beauty
had
caught
the
public
eye
even
in
her
seclusion
and
with
that
poetical
turn
common
to
the
people
of
andalusia
the
peasantry
of
the
neighborhood
had
given
her
the
appellation
of
the
rose

the
the
wary
aunt
continued
to
keep
a
faithful
watch
over
her
tempting
little
niece
as
long
as
the
court
continued
at
granada
and
flattered
herself
that
her
vigilance
had
been
successful
it
is
true
the
good
lady
was
now
and
then
discomposed
by
the
tinkling
of
guitars
and
chanting
of
from
the
moonlit
groves
beneath
the
tower
but
she
would
exhort
her
niece
to
shut
her
ears
against
such
idle
minstrelsy
assuring
her
that
it
was
one
of
the
arts
of
the
opposite
sex
by
which
simple
maids
were
often
lured
to
their
undoing
alas
what
chance
with
a
simple
maid
has
a
dry
lecture
against
a
moonlight
serenade
at
length
king
philip
cut
short
his
sojourn
at
granada
and
suddenly
departed
with
all
his
train
the
vigilant
fredegonda
watched
the
royal
pageant
as
it
issued
forth
from
the
gate
of
justice
and
descended
the
great
avenue
leading
to
the
city
when
the
last
banner
disappeared
from
her
sight
she
returned
exulting
to
her
tower
for
all
her
cares
were
over
to
her
surprise
a
light
arabian
steed
pawed
the
ground
at
the
of
the
garden
to
her
horror
she
saw
through
the
thickets
of
roses
a
youth
in
gayly
embroidered
dress
at
the
feet
of
her
niece
at
the
sound
of
her
footsteps
he
gave
a
tender
adieu
bounded
lightly
over
the
barrier
of
reeds
and
myrtles
sprang
upon
his
horse
and
was
out
of
sight
in
an
instant
the
tender
jacinta
in
the
agony
of
her
grief
lost
all
thought
of
her
aunt
s
displeasure
throwing
herself
into
her
arms
she
broke
forth
into
sobs
and
tears
ay
de

cried
she
he
s
gone
he
s
gone
he
s
gone
and
i
shall
never
see
him
more
gone
who
is
gone
what
youth
is
that
i
saw
at
your
feet
a
queen

aunt
who
came
to
bid
me
a
queen

child
echoed
the
vigilant
fredegonda
faintly
and
when
did
you
become
acquainted
with
the
queen
s
page
the
morning
that
the
came
into
the
tower
it
was
the
queen
s
and
he
came
in
pursuit
of
ah
silly
silly
girl
know
that
there
are
no
half
so
dangerous
as
these
young
prankling
pages
and
it
is
precisely
such
simple
birds
as
thee
that
they
pounce
the
aunt
was
at
first
indignant
at
learning
that
in
despite
of
her
boasted
vigilance
a
tender
intercourse
had
been
carried
on
by
the
youthful
lovers
almost
beneath
her
eye
but
when
she
found
that
her
niece
though
thus
exposed
without
the
protection
of
bolt
or
bar
to
all
the
machinations
of
the
opposite
sex
had
come
forth
unsinged
from
the
fiery
ordeal
she
consoled
herself
with
the
persuasion
that
it
was
owing
to
the
chaste
and
cautious
maxims
in
which
she
had
as
it
were
steeped
her
to
the
very
lips
while
the
aunt
laid
this
soothing
unction
to
her
pride
the
niece
treasured
up
the
vows
of
fidelity
of
the
page
but
what
is
the
love
of
restless
roving
man
a
vagrant
stream
that
dallies
for
a
time
with
each
flower
upon
its
bank
then
passes
on
and
leaves
them
all
in
tears
days
weeks
months
elapsed
and
nothing
more
was
heard
of
the
page
the
pomegranate
ripened
the
vine
yielded
up
its
fruit
the
autumnal
rains
descended
in
torrents
from
the
mountains
the
sierra
nevada
became
covered
with
a
snowy
mantle
and
wintry
blasts
howled
through
the
halls
of
the
alhambra
still
he
came
not
the
winter
passed
away
again
the
genial
spring
burst
forth
with
song
and
blossom
and
balmy
zephyr
the
snows
melted
from
the
mountains
until
none
remained
but
on
the
lofty
summit
of
nevada
glistening
through
the
sultry
summer
air
still
nothing
was
heard
of
the
forgetful
page
in
the
mean
time
the
poor
little
jacinta
grew
pale
and
thoughtful
her
former
occupations
and
amusements
were
abandoned
her
silk
lay
entangled
her
guitar
unstrung
her
flowers
were
neglected
the
notes
of
her
bird
unheeded
and
her
eyes
once
so
bright
were
dimmed
with
secret
weeping
if
any
solitude
could
be
devised
to
foster
the
passion
of
a
damsel
it
would
be
such
a
place
as
the
alhambra
where
everything
seems
disposed
to
produce
tender
and
romantic
reveries
it
is
a
very
paradise
for
lovers
how
hard
then
to
be
alone
in
such
a
paradise
and
not
merely
alone
but
forsaken
alas
silly
child
would
the
staid
and
immaculate
fredegonda
say
when
she
found
her
niece
in
one
of
her
desponding
moods
did
i
not
warn
thee
against
the
wiles
and
deceptions
of
these
men
what
couldst
thou
expect
too
from
one
of
a
haughty
and
aspiring
family
thou
an
orphan
the
descendant
of
a
fallen
and
impoverished
line
be
assured
if
the
youth
were
true
his
father
who
is
one
of
the
proudest
nobles
about
the
court
would
prohibit
his
union
with
one
so
humble
and
portionless
as
thou
pluck
up
thy
resolution
therefore
and
drive
these
idle
notions
from
thy
the
words
of
the
immaculate
fredegonda
only
served
to
increase
the
melancholy
of
her
niece
but
she
sought
to
indulge
it
in
private
at
a
late
hour
one
midsummer
night
after
her
aunt
had
retired
to
rest
she
remained
alone
in
the
hall
of
the
tower
seated
beside
the
alabaster
fountain
it
was
here
that
the
faithless
page
had
first
knelt
and
kissed
her
hand
it
was
here
that
he
had
often
vowed
eternal
fidelity
the
poor
little
damsel
s
heart
was
overladen
with
sad
and
tender
recollections
her
tears
began
to
flow
and
slowly
fell
drop
by
drop
into
the
fountain
by
degrees
the
crystal
water
became
agitated
and
bubble
bubble
bubble
boiled
up
and
was
tossed
about
until
a
female
figure
richly
clad
in
moorish
robes
slowly
rose
to
view
jacinta
was
so
frightened
that
she
fled
from
the
hall
and
did
not
venture
to
return
the
next
morning
she
related
what
she
had
seen
to
her
aunt
but
the
good
lady
treated
it
as
a
fantasy
of
her
troubled
mind
or
supposed
she
had
fallen
asleep
and
dreamt
beside
the
fountain
thou
hast
been
thinking
of
the
story
of
the
three
moorish
princesses
that
once
inhabited
this
tower
continued
she
and
it
has
entered
into
thy
what
story
aunt
i
know
nothing
of
thou
hast
certainly
heard
of
the
three
princesses
zayda
zorayda
and
zorahayda
who
were
confined
in
this
tower
by
the
king
their
father
and
agreed
to
fly
with
three
christian
cavaliers
the
two
first
accomplished
their
escape
but
the
third
failed
in
her
resolution
and
it
is
said
died
in
this
i
now
recollect
to
have
heard
of
it
said
jacinta
and
to
have
wept
over
the
fate
of
the
gentle
thou
mayest
well
weep
over
her
fate
continued
the
aunt
for
the
lover
of
zorahayda
was
thy
ancestor
he
long
bemoaned
his
moorish
love
but
time
cured
him
of
his
grief
and
he
married
a
spanish
lady
from
whom
thou
art
jacinta
ruminated
upon
these
words
that
what
i
have
seen
is
no
fantasy
of
the
brain
said
she
to
herself
i
am
confident
if
indeed
it
be
the
spirit
of
the
gentle
zorahayda
which
i
have
heard
lingers
about
this
tower
of
what
should
i
be
afraid
i
ll
watch
by
the
fountain
perhaps
the
visit
will
be
towards
midnight
when
everything
was
quiet
she
again
took
her
seat
in
the
hall
as
the
bell
in
the
distant
of
the
alhambra
struck
the
midnight
hour
the
fountain
was
again
agitated
and
bubble
bubble
bubble
it
tossed
about
the
waters
until
the
moorish
female
again
rose
to
view
she
was
young
and
beautiful
her
dress
was
rich
with
jewels
and
in
her
hand
she
held
a
silver
lute
jacinta
trembled
and
was
faint
but
was
reassured
by
the
soft
and
plaintive
voice
of
the
apparition
and
the
sweet
expression
of
her
pale
melancholy
countenance
daughter
of
mortality
said
she
what
aileth
thee
why
do
thy
tears
trouble
my
fountain
and
thy
sighs
and
plaints
disturb
the
quiet
watches
of
the
night
i
weep
because
of
the
faithlessness
of
man
and
i
bemoan
my
solitary
and
forsaken
take
comfort
thy
sorrows
may
yet
have
an
end
thou
beholdest
a
moorish
princess
who
like
thee
was
unhappy
in
her
love
a
christian
knight
thy
ancestor
won
my
heart
and
would
have
borne
me
to
his
native
land
and
to
the
bosom
of
his
church
i
was
a
convert
in
my
heart
but
i
lacked
courage
equal
to
my
faith
and
lingered
till
too
late
for
this
the
evil
genii
are
permitted
to
have
power
over
me
and
i
remain
enchanted
in
this
tower
until
some
pure
christian
will
deign
to
break
the
magic
spell
wilt
thou
undertake
the
task
i
will
replied
the
damsel
trembling
come
hither
then
and
fear
not
dip
thy
hand
in
the
fountain
sprinkle
the
water
over
me
and
baptize
me
after
the
manner
of
thy
faith
so
shall
the
enchantment
be
dispelled
and
my
troubled
spirit
have
the
damsel
advanced
with
faltering
steps
dipped
her
hand
in
the
fountain
collected
water
in
the
palm
and
sprinkled
it
over
the
pale
face
of
the
phantom
the
latter
smiled
with
ineffable
benignity
she
dropped
her
silver
lute
at
the
feet
of
jacinta
crossed
her
white
arms
upon
her
bosom
and
melted
from
sight
so
that
it
seemed
merely
as
if
a
shower
of
had
fallen
into
the
fountain
jacinta
retired
from
the
hall
filled
with
awe
and
wonder
she
scarcely
closed
her
eyes
that
night
but
when
she
awoke
at
daybreak
out
of
a
troubled
slumber
the
whole
appeared
to
her
like
a
distempered
dream
on
descending
into
the
hall
however
the
truth
of
the
vision
was
established
for
beside
the
fountain
she
beheld
the
silver
lute
glittering
in
the
morning
sunshine
she
hastened
to
her
aunt
to
relate
all
that
had
befallen
her
and
called
her
to
behold
the
lute
as
a
testimonial
of
the
reality
of
her
story
if
the
good
lady
had
any
lingering
doubts
they
were
removed
when
jacinta
touched
the
instrument
for
she
drew
forth
such
ravishing
tones
as
to
thaw
even
the
frigid
bosom
of
the
immaculate
fredegonda
that
region
of
eternal
winter
into
a
genial
flow
nothing
but
supernatural
melody
could
have
produced
such
an
effect
the
extraordinary
power
of
the
lute
became
every
day
more
and
more
apparent
the
wayfarer
passing
by
the
tower
was
detained
and
as
it
were
in
breathless
ecstasy
the
very
birds
gathered
in
the
neighboring
trees
and
hushing
their
own
strains
listened
in
charmed
silence
rumor
soon
spread
the
news
abroad
the
inhabitants
of
granada
thronged
to
the
alhambra
to
catch
a
few
notes
of
the
transcendent
music
that
floated
about
the
tower
of
las
infantas
the
lovely
little
minstrel
was
at
length
drawn
forth
from
her
retreat
the
rich
and
powerful
of
the
land
contended
who
should
entertain
and
do
honor
to
her
or
rather
who
should
secure
the
charms
of
her
lute
to
draw
fashionable
throngs
to
their
saloons
wherever
she
went
her
vigilant
aunt
kept
a
dragon
watch
at
her
elbow
awing
the
throngs
of
impassioned
admirers
who
hung
in
raptures
on
her
strains
the
report
of
her
wonderful
powers
spread
from
city
to
city
malaga
seville
cordova
all
became
successively
mad
on
the
theme
nothing
was
talked
of
throughout
andalusia
but
the
beautiful
minstrel
of
the
alhambra
how
could
it
be
otherwise
among
a
people
so
musical
and
gallant
as
the
andalusians
when
the
lute
was
magical
in
its
powers
and
the
minstrel
inspired
by
love
while
all
andalusia
was
thus
music
mad
a
different
mood
prevailed
at
the
court
of
spain
philip
as
is
well
known
was
a
miserable
hypochondriac
and
subject
to
all
kinds
of
fancies
sometimes
he
would
keep
to
his
bed
for
weeks
together
groaning
under
imaginary
complaints
at
other
times
he
would
insist
upon
abdicating
his
throne
to
the
great
annoyance
of
his
royal
spouse
who
had
a
strong
relish
for
the
splendors
of
a
court
and
the
glories
of
a
crown
and
guided
the
sceptre
of
her
imbecile
lord
with
an
expert
and
steady
hand
nothing
was
found
to
be
so
efficacious
in
dispelling
the
royal
megrims
as
the
power
of
music
the
queen
took
care
therefore
to
have
the
best
performers
both
vocal
and
instrumental
at
hand
and
retained
the
famous
italian
singer
farinelli
about
the
court
as
a
kind
of
royal
physician
at
the
moment
we
treat
of
however
a
freak
had
come
over
the
mind
of
this
sapient
and
illustrious
bourbon
that
surpassed
all
former
vagaries
after
a
long
spell
of
imaginary
illness
which
set
all
the
strains
of
farinelli
and
the
consultations
of
a
whole
orchestra
of
at
defiance
the
monarch
fairly
in
idea
gave
up
the
ghost
and
considered
himself
absolutely
dead
this
would
have
been
harmless
enough
and
even
convenient
both
to
his
queen
and
courtiers
had
he
been
content
to
remain
in
the
quietude
befitting
a
dead
man
but
to
their
annoyance
he
insisted
upon
having
the
funeral
ceremonies
performed
over
him
and
to
their
inexpressible
perplexity
began
to
grow
impatient
and
to
revile
bitterly
at
them
for
negligence
and
disrespect
in
leaving
him
unburied
what
was
to
be
done
to
disobey
the
king
s
positive
commands
was
monstrous
in
the
eyes
of
the
obsequious
courtiers
of
a
punctilious
court
but
to
obey
him
and
bury
him
alive
would
be
downright
regicide
in
the
midst
of
this
fearful
dilemma
a
rumor
reached
the
court
of
the
female
minstrel
who
was
turning
the
brains
of
all
andalusia
the
queen
dispatched
missions
in
all
haste
to
summon
her
to
ildefonso
where
the
court
at
that
time
resided
within
a
few
days
as
the
queen
with
her
maids
of
honor
was
walking
in
those
stately
gardens
intended
with
their
avenues
and
terraces
and
fountains
to
eclipse
the
glories
of
versailles
the
minstrel
was
conducted
into
her
presence
the
imperial
elizabetta
gazed
with
surprise
at
the
youthful
and
unpretending
appearance
of
the
little
being
that
had
set
the
world
madding
she
was
in
her
picturesque
andalusian
dress
her
silver
lute
in
hand
and
stood
with
modest
and
downcast
eyes
but
with
a
simplicity
and
freshness
of
beauty
that
still
bespoke
her
the
rose
of
the
as
usual
she
was
accompanied
by
the
fredegonda
who
gave
the
whole
history
of
her
parentage
and
descent
to
the
inquiring
queen
if
the
stately
elizabetta
had
been
interested
by
the
appearance
of
jacinta
she
was
still
more
pleased
when
she
learnt
that
she
was
of
a
meritorious
though
impoverished
line
and
that
her
father
had
bravely
fallen
in
the
service
of
the
crown
if
thy
powers
equal
their
renown
said
she
and
thou
canst
cast
forth
this
evil
spirit
that
possesses
thy
sovereign
thy
fortunes
shall
henceforth
be
my
care
and
honors
and
wealth
attend
impatient
to
make
trial
of
her
skill
she
led
the
way
at
once
to
the
apartment
of
the
moody
monarch
jacinta
followed
with
downcast
eyes
through
files
of
guards
and
crowds
of
courtiers
they
arrived
at
length
at
a
great
chamber
hung
with
black
the
windows
were
closed
to
exclude
the
light
of
day
a
number
of
yellow
wax
tapers
in
silver
sconces
diffused
a
lugubrious
light
and
dimly
revealed
the
figures
of
mutes
in
mourning
dresses
and
courtiers
who
glided
about
with
noiseless
step
and
visage
in
the
midst
of
a
funeral
bed
or
bier
his
hands
folded
on
his
breast
and
the
tip
of
his
nose
just
visible
lay
extended
this
monarch
the
queen
entered
the
chamber
in
silence
and
pointing
to
a
footstool
in
an
obscure
corner
beckoned
to
jacinta
to
sit
down
and
commence
at
first
she
touched
her
lute
with
a
faltering
hand
but
gathering
confidence
and
animation
as
she
proceeded
drew
forth
such
soft
aërial
harmony
that
all
present
could
scarce
believe
it
mortal
as
to
the
monarch
who
had
already
considered
himself
in
the
world
of
spirits
he
set
it
down
for
some
angelic
melody
or
the
music
of
the
spheres
by
degrees
the
theme
was
varied
and
the
voice
of
the
minstrel
accompanied
the
instrument
she
poured
forth
one
of
the
legendary
ballads
treating
of
the
ancient
glories
of
the
alhambra
and
the
achievements
of
the
moors
her
whole
soul
entered
into
the
theme
for
with
the
recollections
of
the
alhambra
was
associated
the
story
of
her
love
the
resounded
with
the
animating
strain
it
entered
into
the
gloomy
heart
of
the
monarch
he
raised
his
head
and
gazed
around
he
sat
up
on
his
couch
his
eye
began
to
kindle
at
length
leaping
upon
the
floor
he
called
for
sword
and
buckler
the
triumph
of
music
or
rather
of
the
enchanted
lute
was
complete
the
demon
of
melancholy
was
cast
forth
and
as
it
were
a
dead
man
brought
to
life
the
windows
of
the
apartment
were
thrown
open
the
glorious
effulgence
of
spanish
sunshine
burst
into
the
late
lugubrious
chamber
all
eyes
sought
the
lovely
enchantress
but
the
lute
had
fallen
from
her
hand
she
had
sunk
upon
the
earth
and
the
next
moment
was
clasped
to
the
bosom
of
ruyz
de
alarcon
the
nuptials
of
the
happy
couple
were
celebrated
soon
afterwards
with
great
splendor
and
the
rose
of
the
alhambra
became
the
ornament
and
delight
of
the
court
but
hold
not
so
fast
i
hear
the
reader
exclaim
this
is
jumping
to
the
end
of
a
story
at
a
furious
rate
first
let
us
know
how
ruyz
de
alarcon
managed
to
account
to
jacinta
for
his
long
neglect
nothing
more
easy
the
venerable
excuse
the
opposition
to
his
wishes
by
a
proud
pragmatical
old
father
besides
young
people
who
really
like
one
another
soon
come
to
an
amicable
understanding
and
bury
all
past
grievances
when
once
they
meet
but
how
was
the
proud
pragmatical
old
father
reconciled
to
the
match
oh
as
to
that
his
scruples
were
easily
overcome
by
a
word
or
two
from
the
queen
especially
as
dignities
and
rewards
were
showered
upon
the
blooming
favorite
of
royalty
besides
the
lute
of
jacinta
you
know
possessed
a
magic
power
and
could
control
the
most
stubborn
head
and
hardest
breast
and
what
came
of
the
enchanted
lute
oh
that
is
the
most
curious
matter
of
all
and
plainly
proves
the
truth
of
the
whole
story
that
lute
remained
for
some
time
in
the
family
but
was
purloined
and
carried
off
as
was
supposed
by
the
great
singer
farinelli
in
pure
jealousy
at
his
death
it
passed
into
other
hands
in
italy
who
were
ignorant
of
its
mystic
powers
and
melting
down
the
silver
transferred
the
strings
to
an
old
cremona
fiddle
the
strings
still
retain
something
of
their
magic
virtues
a
word
in
the
reader
s
ear
but
let
it
go
no
further
that
fiddle
is
now
bewitching
the
whole
world
it
is
the
fiddle
of
paganini
the
veteran
among
the
curious
acquaintances
i
made
in
my
rambles
about
the
fortress
was
a
brave
and
battered
old
colonel
of
invalids
who
was
nestled
like
a
hawk
in
one
of
the
moorish
towers
his
history
which
he
was
fond
of
telling
was
a
tissue
of
those
adventures
mishaps
and
vicissitudes
that
render
the
life
of
almost
every
spaniard
of
note
as
varied
and
whimsical
as
the
pages
of
gil
blas
he
was
in
america
at
twelve
years
of
age
and
reckoned
among
the
most
signal
and
fortunate
events
of
his
life
his
having
seen
general
washington
since
then
he
had
taken
a
part
in
all
the
wars
of
his
country
he
could
speak
experimentally
of
most
of
the
prisons
and
dungeons
of
the
peninsula
had
been
lamed
of
one
leg
crippled
in
his
hands
and
so
cut
up
and
carbonadoed
that
he
was
a
kind
of
walking
monument
of
the
troubles
of
spain
on
which
there
was
a
scar
for
every
battle
and
broil
as
every
year
of
captivity
was
notched
upon
the
tree
of
robinson
crusoe
the
greatest
misfortune
of
the
brave
old
cavalier
however
appeared
to
have
been
his
having
commanded
at
malaga
during
a
time
of
peril
and
confusion
and
been
made
a
general
by
the
inhabitants
to
protect
them
from
the
invasion
of
the
french
this
had
entailed
upon
him
a
number
of
just
claims
upon
government
that
i
feared
would
employ
him
until
his
dying
day
in
writing
and
printing
petitions
and
memorials
to
the
great
disquiet
of
his
mind
exhaustion
of
his
purse
and
penance
of
his
friends
not
one
of
whom
could
visit
him
without
having
to
listen
to
a
mortal
document
of
half
an
hour
in
length
and
to
carry
away
half
a
dozen
pamphlets
in
his
pocket
this
however
is
the
case
throughout
spain
everywhere
you
meet
with
some
worthy
wight
brooding
in
a
corner
and
nursing
up
some
pet
grievance
and
cherished
wrong
besides
a
spaniard
who
has
a
lawsuit
or
a
claim
upon
government
may
be
considered
as
furnished
with
employment
for
the
remainder
of
his
life
i
visited
the
veteran
in
his
quarters
in
the
upper
part
of
the
torre
del
vino
or
wine
tower
his
room
was
small
but
snug
and
commanded
a
beautiful
view
of
the
vega
it
was
arranged
with
a
soldier
s
precision
three
muskets
and
a
brace
of
pistols
all
bright
and
shining
were
suspended
against
the
wall
with
a
sabre
and
a
cane
hanging
side
by
side
and
above
them
two
cocked
hats
one
for
parade
and
one
for
ordinary
use
a
small
shelf
containing
some
half
dozen
books
formed
his
library
one
of
which
a
little
old
mouldy
volume
of
philosophical
maxims
was
his
favorite
reading
this
he
thumbed
and
pondered
over
day
by
day
applying
every
maxim
to
his
own
particular
case
provided
it
had
a
little
tinge
of
wholesome
bitterness
and
treated
of
the
injustice
of
the
world
yet
he
was
social
and
and
provided
he
could
be
diverted
from
his
wrongs
and
his
philosophy
was
an
entertaining
companion
i
like
these
old
sons
of
fortune
and
enjoy
their
rough
campaigning
anecdotes
in
the
course
of
my
visits
to
the
one
in
question
i
learnt
some
curious
facts
about
an
old
military
commander
of
the
fortress
who
seems
to
have
resembled
him
in
some
respects
and
to
have
had
similar
fortunes
in
the
wars
these
particulars
have
been
augmented
by
inquiries
among
some
of
the
old
inhabitants
of
the
place
particularly
the
father
of
mateo
ximenes
of
whose
traditional
stories
the
worthy
i
am
about
to
introduce
to
the
reader
was
a
favorite
hero
the
governor
and
the
notary
in
former
times
there
ruled
as
governor
of
the
alhambra
a
doughty
old
cavalier
who
from
having
lost
one
arm
in
the
wars
was
commonly
known
by
the
name
of
el
gobernador
manco
or
the
he
in
fact
prided
himself
upon
being
an
old
soldier
wore
his
moustaches
curled
up
to
his
eyes
a
pair
of
campaigning
boots
and
a
toledo
as
long
as
a
spit
with
his
in
the
he
was
moreover
exceedingly
proud
and
punctilious
and
tenacious
of
all
his
privileges
and
dignities
under
his
sway
the
immunities
of
the
alhambra
as
a
royal
residence
and
domain
were
rigidly
exacted
no
one
was
permitted
to
enter
the
fortress
with
or
even
with
a
sword
or
staff
unless
he
were
of
a
certain
rank
and
every
horseman
was
obliged
to
dismount
at
the
gate
and
lead
his
horse
by
the
bridle
now
as
the
hill
of
the
alhambra
rises
from
the
very
midst
of
the
city
of
granada
being
as
it
were
an
excrescence
of
the
capital
it
must
at
all
times
be
somewhat
irksome
to
the
who
commands
the
province
to
have
thus
an
in
a
petty
independent
post
in
the
very
centre
of
his
domains
it
was
rendered
the
more
galling
in
the
present
instance
from
the
irritable
jealousy
of
the
old
governor
that
took
fire
on
the
least
question
of
authority
and
jurisdiction
and
from
the
loose
vagrant
character
of
the
people
who
had
gradually
nestled
themselves
within
the
fortress
as
in
a
sanctuary
and
thence
carried
on
a
system
of
roguery
and
depredation
at
the
expense
of
the
honest
inhabitants
of
the
city
thus
there
was
a
perpetual
feud
and
between
the
and
the
governor
the
more
virulent
on
the
part
of
the
latter
inasmuch
as
the
smallest
of
two
neighboring
potentates
is
always
the
most
captious
about
his
dignity
the
stately
palace
of
the
stood
in
the
plaza
nueva
immediately
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
of
the
alhambra
and
here
was
always
a
bustle
and
parade
of
guards
and
domestics
and
city
functionaries
a
beetling
bastion
of
the
fortress
overlooked
the
palace
and
public
square
in
front
of
it
and
on
this
bastion
the
old
governor
would
occasionally
strut
backwards
and
forwards
with
his
toledo
girded
by
his
side
keeping
a
wary
eye
down
upon
his
rival
like
a
hawk
reconnoitring
his
quarry
from
his
nest
in
a
dry
tree
whenever
he
descended
into
the
city
it
was
in
grand
parade
on
horseback
surrounded
by
his
guards
or
in
his
state
coach
an
ancient
and
unwieldy
spanish
edifice
of
carved
timber
and
gilt
leather
drawn
by
eight
mules
with
running
footmen
outriders
and
lackeys
on
which
occasions
he
flattered
himself
he
impressed
every
beholder
with
awe
and
admiration
as
vicegerent
of
the
king
though
the
wits
of
granada
particularly
those
who
loitered
about
the
palace
of
the
were
apt
to
sneer
at
his
petty
parade
and
in
allusion
to
the
vagrant
character
of
his
subjects
to
greet
him
with
the
appellation
of
the
king
of
the
one
of
the
most
fruitful
sources
of
dispute
between
these
two
doughty
rivals
was
the
right
claimed
by
the
governor
to
have
all
things
passed
free
of
duty
through
the
city
that
were
intended
for
the
use
of
himself
or
his
garrison
by
degrees
this
privilege
had
given
rise
to
extensive
smuggling
a
nest
of
contrabandistas
took
up
their
abode
in
the
hovels
of
the
fortress
and
the
numerous
caves
in
its
vicinity
and
drove
a
thriving
business
under
the
connivance
of
the
soldiers
of
the
garrison
the
vigilance
of
the
was
aroused
he
consulted
his
legal
adviser
and
factotum
a
shrewd
meddlesome
escribano
or
notary
who
rejoiced
in
an
opportunity
of
perplexing
the
old
potentate
of
the
alhambra
and
involving
him
in
a
maze
of
legal
subtilties
he
advised
the
to
insist
upon
the
right
of
examining
every
convoy
passing
through
the
gates
of
his
city
and
penned
a
long
letter
for
him
in
vindication
of
the
right
governor
manco
was
a
old
soldier
who
hated
an
escribano
worse
than
the
devil
and
this
one
in
particular
worse
than
all
other
escribanos
what
said
he
curling
up
his
moustaches
fiercely
does
the
set
his
man
of
the
pen
to
practise
confusions
upon
me
i
ll
let
him
see
an
old
soldier
is
not
to
be
baffled
by
he
seized
his
pen
and
scrawled
a
short
letter
in
a
crabbed
hand
in
which
without
deigning
to
enter
into
argument
he
insisted
on
the
right
of
transit
free
of
search
and
denounced
vengeance
on
any
officer
who
should
lay
his
unhallowed
hand
on
any
convoy
protected
by
the
flag
of
the
alhambra
while
this
question
was
agitated
between
the
two
pragmatical
potentates
it
so
happened
that
a
mule
laden
with
supplies
for
the
fortress
arrived
one
day
at
the
gate
of
xenil
by
which
it
was
to
traverse
a
suburb
of
the
city
on
its
way
to
the
alhambra
the
convoy
was
headed
by
a
testy
old
corporal
who
had
long
served
under
the
governor
and
was
a
man
after
his
own
heart
as
rusty
and
stanch
as
an
old
toledo
blade
as
they
approached
the
gate
of
the
city
the
corporal
placed
the
banner
of
the
alhambra
on
the
of
the
mule
and
drawing
himself
up
to
a
perfect
perpendicular
advanced
with
his
head
dressed
to
the
front
but
with
the
wary
of
a
cur
passing
through
hostile
ground
and
ready
for
a
snap
and
a
snarl
who
goes
there
said
the
sentinel
at
the
gate
soldier
of
the
alhambra
said
the
corporal
without
turning
his
head
what
have
you
in
charge
provisions
for
the
the
corporal
marched
straight
forward
followed
by
the
convoy
but
had
not
advanced
many
paces
before
a
posse
of
officers
rushed
out
of
a
small
hallo
there
cried
the
leader
muleteer
halt
and
open
those
the
corporal
wheeled
round
and
drew
himself
up
in
respect
the
flag
of
the
alhambra
said
he
these
things
are
for
the
a
figo
for
the
governor
and
a
figo
for
his
flag
muleteer
halt
i
stop
the
convoy
at
your
peril
cried
the
corporal
cocking
his
musket
muleteer
the
muleteer
gave
his
beast
a
hearty
thwack
the
officer
sprang
forward
and
seized
the
halter
whereupon
the
corporal
levelled
his
piece
and
shot
him
dead
the
street
was
immediately
in
an
uproar
the
old
corporal
was
seized
and
after
undergoing
sundry
kicks
and
cuffs
and
cudgellings
which
are
generally
given
impromptu
by
the
mob
in
spain
as
a
foretaste
of
the
after
penalties
of
the
law
he
was
loaded
with
irons
and
conducted
to
the
city
prison
while
his
comrades
were
permitted
to
proceed
with
the
convoy
after
it
had
been
well
rummaged
to
the
alhambra
the
old
governor
was
in
a
towering
passion
when
he
heard
of
this
insult
to
his
flag
and
capture
of
his
corporal
for
a
time
he
stormed
about
the
moorish
halls
and
vapored
about
the
bastions
and
looked
down
fire
and
sword
upon
the
palace
of
the
having
vented
the
first
ebullition
of
his
wrath
he
dispatched
a
message
demanding
the
surrender
of
the
corporal
as
to
him
alone
belonged
the
right
of
sitting
in
judgment
on
the
offences
of
those
under
his
command
the
aided
by
the
pen
of
the
delighted
escribano
replied
at
great
length
arguing
that
as
the
offence
had
been
committed
within
the
walls
of
his
city
and
against
one
of
his
civil
officers
it
was
clearly
within
his
proper
jurisdiction
the
governor
rejoined
by
a
repetition
of
his
demand
the
gave
a
of
still
greater
length
and
legal
acumen
the
governor
became
hotter
and
more
peremptory
in
his
demands
and
the
cooler
and
more
copious
in
his
replies
until
the
old
soldier
absolutely
roared
with
fury
at
being
thus
entangled
in
the
meshes
of
legal
controversy
while
the
subtle
escribano
was
thus
amusing
himself
at
the
expense
of
the
governor
he
was
conducting
the
trial
of
the
corporal
who
mewed
up
in
a
narrow
dungeon
of
the
prison
had
merely
a
small
grated
window
at
which
to
show
his
visage
and
receive
the
consolations
of
his
friends
a
mountain
of
written
testimony
was
diligently
heaped
up
according
to
spanish
form
by
the
indefatigable
escribano
the
corporal
was
completely
overwhelmed
by
it
he
was
convicted
of
murder
and
sentenced
to
be
hanged
it
was
in
vain
the
governor
sent
down
remonstrance
and
menace
from
the
alhambra
the
fatal
day
was
at
hand
and
the
corporal
was
put
that
is
to
say
in
the
chapel
of
the
prison
as
is
always
done
with
culprits
the
day
before
execution
that
they
may
meditate
on
their
approaching
end
and
repent
them
of
their
sins
seeing
things
drawing
to
extremity
the
old
governor
determined
to
attend
to
the
affair
in
person
for
this
purpose
he
ordered
out
his
carriage
of
state
and
surrounded
by
his
guards
rumbled
down
the
avenue
of
the
alhambra
into
the
city
driving
to
the
house
of
the
escribano
he
summoned
him
to
the
portal
the
eye
of
the
old
governor
gleamed
like
a
coal
at
beholding
the
smirking
man
of
the
law
advancing
with
an
air
of
exultation
what
is
this
i
hear
cried
he
that
you
are
about
to
put
to
death
one
of
my
soldiers
all
according
to
law
all
in
strict
form
of
justice
said
the
escribano
chuckling
and
rubbing
his
hands
i
can
show
your
excellency
the
written
testimony
in
the
fetch
it
hither
said
the
governor
the
escribano
bustled
into
his
office
delighted
with
having
another
opportunity
of
displaying
his
ingenuity
at
the
expense
of
the
veteran
he
returned
with
a
satchel
full
of
papers
and
began
to
read
a
long
deposition
with
professional
volubility
by
this
time
a
crowd
had
collected
listening
with
necks
and
gaping
mouths
prithee
man
get
into
the
carriage
out
of
this
pestilent
throng
that
i
may
the
better
hear
thee
said
the
governor
the
escribano
entered
the
carriage
when
in
a
twinkling
the
door
was
closed
the
coachman
smacked
his
whip
mules
carriage
guards
and
all
dashed
off
at
a
thundering
rate
leaving
the
crowd
in
gaping
wonderment
nor
did
the
governor
pause
until
he
had
lodged
his
prey
in
one
of
the
strongest
dungeons
of
the
alhambra
he
then
sent
down
a
flag
of
truce
in
military
style
proposing
a
cartel
or
exchange
of
prisoners
the
corporal
for
the
notary
the
pride
of
the
was
piqued
he
returned
a
contemptuous
refusal
and
forthwith
caused
a
gallows
tall
and
strong
to
be
erected
in
the
centre
of
the
plaza
nueva
for
the
execution
of
the
corporal
oho
is
that
the
game
said
governor
manco
he
gave
orders
and
immediately
a
gibbet
was
reared
on
the
verge
of
the
great
beetling
bastion
that
overlooked
the
plaza
now
said
he
in
a
message
to
the
hang
my
soldier
when
you
please
but
at
the
same
time
that
he
is
swung
off
in
the
square
look
up
to
see
your
escribano
dangling
against
the
the
was
inflexible
troops
were
paraded
in
the
square
the
drums
beat
the
bell
tolled
an
immense
multitude
of
amateurs
gathered
together
to
behold
the
execution
on
the
other
hand
the
governor
paraded
his
garrison
on
the
bastion
and
tolled
the
funeral
dirge
of
the
notary
from
the
torre
de
la
campana
or
tower
of
the
bell
the
notary
s
wife
pressed
through
the
crowd
with
a
whole
progeny
of
little
embryo
escribanos
at
her
heels
and
throwing
herself
at
the
feet
of
the
implored
him
not
to
sacrifice
the
life
of
her
husband
and
the
welfare
of
herself
and
her
numerous
little
ones
to
a
point
of
pride
for
you
know
the
old
governor
too
well
said
she
to
doubt
that
he
will
put
his
threat
in
execution
if
you
hang
the
the
was
overpowered
by
her
tears
and
lamentations
and
the
clamors
of
her
callow
brood
the
corporal
was
sent
up
to
the
alhambra
under
a
guard
in
his
gallows
garb
like
a
hooded
friar
but
with
head
erect
and
a
face
of
iron
the
escribano
was
demanded
in
exchange
according
to
the
cartel
the
once
bustling
and
man
of
the
law
was
drawn
forth
from
his
dungeon
more
dead
than
alive
all
his
flippancy
and
conceit
had
evaporated
his
hair
it
is
said
had
nearly
turned
gray
with
affright
and
he
had
a
downcast
dogged
look
as
if
he
still
felt
the
halter
round
his
neck
the
old
governor
stuck
his
one
arm
akimbo
and
for
a
moment
surveyed
him
with
an
iron
smile
henceforth
my
friend
said
he
moderate
your
zeal
in
hurrying
others
to
the
gallows
be
not
too
certain
of
your
safety
even
though
you
should
have
the
law
on
your
side
and
above
all
take
care
how
you
play
off
your
schoolcraft
another
time
upon
an
old
governor
manco
and
the
soldier
while
governor
manco
or
the
kept
up
a
show
of
military
state
in
the
alhambra
he
became
nettled
at
the
reproaches
continually
cast
upon
his
fortress
of
being
a
of
rogues
and
contrabandistas
on
a
sudden
the
old
potentate
determined
on
reform
and
setting
vigorously
to
work
ejected
whole
nests
of
vagabonds
out
of
the
fortress
and
the
gypsy
caves
with
which
the
surrounding
hills
are
honeycombed
he
sent
out
soldiers
also
to
patrol
the
avenues
and
footpaths
with
orders
to
take
up
all
suspicious
persons
one
bright
summer
morning
a
patrol
consisting
of
the
testy
old
corporal
who
had
distinguished
himself
in
the
affair
of
the
notary
a
trumpeter
and
two
privates
was
seated
under
the
of
the
generalife
beside
the
road
which
leads
down
from
the
mountain
of
the
sun
when
they
heard
the
tramp
of
a
horse
and
a
male
voice
singing
in
rough
though
not
unmusical
tones
an
old
castilian
presently
they
beheld
a
sturdy
sunburnt
fellow
clad
in
the
ragged
garb
of
a
leading
a
powerful
arabian
horse
caparisoned
in
the
ancient
morisco
fashion
astonished
at
the
sight
of
a
strange
soldier
descending
steed
in
hand
from
that
solitary
mountain
the
corporal
stepped
forth
and
challenged
him
who
goes
there
a
who
and
what
are
you
a
poor
soldier
just
from
the
wars
with
a
cracked
crown
and
empty
purse
for
a
by
this
time
they
were
enabled
to
view
him
more
narrowly
he
had
a
black
patch
across
his
forehead
which
with
a
grizzled
beard
added
to
a
certain
cast
of
countenance
while
a
slight
squint
threw
into
the
whole
an
occasional
gleam
of
roguish
having
answered
the
questions
of
the
patrol
the
soldier
seemed
to
consider
himself
entitled
to
make
others
in
return
may
i
ask
said
he
what
city
is
that
which
i
see
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
what
city
cried
the
trumpeter
come
that
s
too
bad
here
s
a
fellow
lurking
about
the
mountain
of
the
sun
and
demands
the
name
of
the
great
city
of
granada
granada
madre
di
dios
can
it
be
possible
perhaps
not
rejoined
the
trumpeter
and
perhaps
you
have
no
idea
that
yonder
are
the
towers
of
the
son
of
a
trumpet
replied
the
stranger
do
not
trifle
with
me
if
this
be
indeed
the
alhambra
i
have
some
strange
matters
to
reveal
to
the
you
will
have
an
opportunity
said
the
corporal
for
we
mean
to
take
you
before
by
this
time
the
trumpeter
had
seized
the
bridle
of
the
steed
the
two
privates
had
each
secured
an
arm
of
the
soldier
the
corporal
put
himself
in
front
gave
the
word
forward
march
and
away
they
marched
for
the
alhambra
the
sight
of
a
ragged
and
a
fine
arabian
horse
brought
in
captive
by
the
patrol
attracted
the
attention
of
all
the
idlers
of
the
fortress
and
of
those
gossip
groups
that
generally
assemble
about
wells
and
fountains
at
early
dawn
the
wheel
of
the
cistern
paused
in
its
rotations
and
the
slipshod
stood
gaping
with
pitcher
in
hand
as
the
corporal
passed
by
with
his
prize
a
motley
train
gradually
gathered
in
the
rear
of
the
escort
knowing
nods
and
winks
and
conjectures
passed
from
one
to
another
it
is
a
deserter
said
one
a
contrabandista
said
another
a
bandolero
said
a
third
until
it
was
affirmed
that
a
captain
of
a
desperate
band
of
robbers
had
been
captured
by
the
prowess
of
the
corporal
and
his
patrol
well
well
said
the
old
crones
one
to
another
captain
or
not
let
him
get
out
of
the
grasp
of
old
governor
manco
if
he
can
though
he
is
but
governor
manco
was
seated
in
one
of
the
inner
halls
of
the
alhambra
taking
his
morning
s
cup
of
chocolate
in
company
with
his
confessor
a
fat
franciscan
friar
from
the
neighboring
convent
a
demure
damsel
of
malaga
the
daughter
of
his
housekeeper
was
attending
upon
him
the
world
hinted
that
the
damsel
who
with
all
her
demureness
was
a
sly
buxom
baggage
had
found
out
a
soft
spot
in
the
iron
heart
of
the
old
governor
and
held
complete
control
over
him
but
let
that
pass
the
domestic
affairs
of
these
mighty
potentates
of
the
earth
should
not
be
too
narrowly
scrutinized
when
word
was
brought
that
a
suspicious
stranger
had
been
taken
lurking
about
the
fortress
and
was
actually
in
the
outer
court
in
durance
of
the
corporal
waiting
the
pleasure
of
his
excellency
the
pride
and
stateliness
of
office
swelled
the
bosom
of
the
governor
giving
back
his
into
the
hands
of
the
demure
damsel
he
called
for
his
sword
girded
it
to
his
side
twirled
up
his
moustaches
took
his
seat
in
a
large
chair
assumed
a
bitter
and
forbidding
aspect
and
ordered
the
prisoner
into
his
presence
the
soldier
was
brought
in
still
closely
pinioned
by
his
captors
and
guarded
by
the
corporal
he
maintained
however
a
resolute
air
and
returned
the
sharp
scrutinizing
look
of
the
governor
with
an
easy
squint
which
by
no
means
pleased
the
punctilious
old
potentate
well
culprit
said
the
governor
after
he
had
regarded
him
for
a
moment
in
silence
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
who
are
you
a
soldier
just
from
the
wars
who
has
brought
away
nothing
but
scars
and
a
soldier
humph
a
by
your
garb
i
understand
you
have
a
fine
arabian
horse
i
presume
you
brought
him
too
from
the
wars
besides
your
scars
and
may
it
please
your
excellency
i
have
something
strange
to
tell
about
that
horse
indeed
i
have
one
of
the
most
wonderful
things
to
relate
something
too
that
concerns
the
security
of
this
fortress
indeed
of
all
granada
but
it
is
a
matter
to
be
imparted
only
to
your
private
ear
or
in
presence
of
such
only
as
are
in
your
the
governor
considered
for
a
moment
and
then
directed
the
corporal
and
his
men
to
withdraw
but
to
post
themselves
outside
of
the
door
and
be
ready
at
a
call
this
holy
friar
said
he
is
my
confessor
you
may
say
anything
in
his
presence
and
this
damsel
nodding
towards
the
handmaid
who
had
loitered
with
an
air
of
great
curiosity
this
damsel
is
of
great
secrecy
and
discretion
and
to
be
trusted
with
the
soldier
gave
a
glance
between
a
squint
and
a
leer
at
the
demure
handmaid
i
am
perfectly
willing
said
he
that
the
damsel
should
when
all
the
rest
had
withdrawn
the
soldier
commenced
his
story
he
was
a
fluent
varlet
and
had
a
command
of
language
above
his
apparent
rank
may
it
please
your
excellency
said
he
i
am
as
i
before
observed
a
soldier
and
have
seen
some
hard
service
but
my
term
of
enlistment
being
expired
i
was
discharged
not
long
since
from
the
army
at
valladolid
and
set
out
on
foot
for
my
native
village
in
andalusia
yesterday
evening
the
sun
went
down
as
i
was
traversing
a
great
dry
plain
of
old
hold
cried
the
governor
what
is
this
you
say
old
castile
is
some
two
or
three
hundred
miles
from
even
so
replied
the
soldier
coolly
i
told
your
excellency
i
had
strange
things
to
relate
but
not
more
strange
than
true
as
your
excellency
will
find
if
you
will
deign
me
a
patient
proceed
culprit
said
the
governor
twirling
up
his
moustaches
as
the
sun
went
down
continued
the
soldier
i
cast
my
eyes
about
in
search
of
quarters
for
the
night
but
as
far
as
my
sight
could
reach
there
were
no
signs
of
habitation
i
saw
that
i
should
have
to
make
my
bed
on
the
naked
plain
with
my
knapsack
for
a
pillow
but
your
excellency
is
an
old
soldier
and
knows
that
to
one
who
has
been
in
the
wars
such
a
night
s
lodging
is
no
great
the
governor
nodded
assent
as
he
drew
his
out
of
the
to
drive
away
a
fly
that
buzzed
about
his
nose
well
to
make
a
long
story
short
continued
the
soldier
i
trudged
forward
for
several
miles
until
i
came
to
a
bridge
over
a
deep
ravine
through
which
ran
a
little
thread
of
water
almost
dried
up
by
the
summer
heat
at
one
end
of
the
bridge
was
a
moorish
tower
the
upper
end
all
in
ruins
but
a
vault
in
the
foundation
quite
entire
here
thinks
i
is
a
good
place
to
make
a
halt
so
i
went
down
to
the
stream
and
took
a
hearty
drink
for
the
water
was
pure
and
sweet
and
i
was
parched
with
thirst
then
opening
my
wallet
i
took
out
an
onion
and
a
few
crusts
which
were
all
my
provisions
and
seating
myself
on
a
stone
on
the
margin
of
the
stream
began
to
make
my
supper
intending
afterwards
to
quarter
myself
for
the
night
in
the
vault
of
the
tower
and
capital
quarters
they
would
have
been
for
a
campaigner
just
from
the
wars
as
your
excellency
who
is
an
old
soldier
may
i
have
put
up
gladly
with
worse
in
my
time
said
the
governor
returning
his
into
the
hilt
of
his
sword
while
i
was
quietly
crunching
my
crust
pursued
the
soldier
i
heard
something
stir
within
the
vault
i
listened
it
was
the
tramp
of
a
horse
a
man
came
forth
from
a
door
in
the
foundation
of
the
tower
close
by
the
water
s
edge
leading
a
powerful
horse
by
the
bridle
i
could
not
well
make
out
what
he
was
by
the
starlight
it
had
a
suspicious
look
to
be
lurking
among
the
ruins
of
a
tower
in
that
wild
solitary
place
he
might
be
a
mere
wayfarer
like
myself
he
might
be
a
contrabandista
he
might
be
a
bandolero
what
of
that
thank
heaven
and
my
poverty
i
had
nothing
to
lose
so
i
sat
still
and
crunched
my
crust
he
led
his
horse
to
the
water
close
by
where
i
was
sitting
so
that
i
had
a
fair
opportunity
of
reconnoitring
him
to
my
surprise
he
was
dressed
in
a
moorish
garb
with
a
cuirass
of
steel
and
a
polished
that
i
distinguished
by
the
reflection
of
the
stars
upon
it
his
horse
too
was
harnessed
in
the
morisco
fashion
with
great
shovel
stirrups
he
led
him
as
i
said
to
the
side
of
the
stream
into
which
the
animal
plunged
his
head
almost
to
the
eyes
and
drank
until
i
thought
he
would
have
burst
comrade
said
i
your
steed
drinks
well
it
s
a
good
sign
when
a
horse
plunges
his
muzzle
bravely
into
the
he
may
well
drink
said
the
stranger
speaking
with
a
moorish
accent
it
is
a
good
year
since
he
had
his
last
by
santiago
said
i
that
beats
even
the
camels
i
have
seen
in
africa
but
come
you
seem
to
be
something
of
a
soldier
will
you
sit
down
and
take
part
of
a
soldier
s
fare
in
fact
i
felt
the
want
of
a
companion
in
this
lonely
place
and
was
willing
to
put
up
with
an
infidel
besides
as
your
excellency
well
knows
a
soldier
is
never
very
particular
about
the
faith
of
his
company
and
soldiers
of
all
countries
are
comrades
on
peaceable
the
governor
again
nodded
assent
well
as
i
was
saying
i
invited
him
to
share
my
supper
such
as
it
was
for
i
could
not
do
less
in
common
hospitality
i
have
no
time
to
pause
for
meat
or
drink
said
he
i
have
a
long
journey
to
make
before
in
what
direction
said
i
andalusia
said
he
exactly
my
route
said
i
so
as
you
won
t
stop
and
eat
with
me
perhaps
you
will
let
me
mount
and
ride
with
you
i
see
your
horse
is
of
a
powerful
frame
i
ll
warrant
he
ll
carry
agreed
said
the
trooper
and
it
would
not
have
been
civil
and
soldierlike
to
refuse
especially
as
i
had
offered
to
share
my
supper
with
him
so
up
he
mounted
and
up
i
mounted
behind
him
hold
fast
said
he
my
steed
goes
like
the
never
fear
me
said
i
and
so
off
we
set
from
a
walk
the
horse
soon
passed
to
a
trot
from
a
trot
to
a
gallop
and
from
a
gallop
to
a
scamper
it
seemed
as
if
rocks
trees
houses
everything
flew
behind
us
what
town
is
this
said
i
segovia
said
he
and
before
the
word
was
out
of
his
mouth
the
towers
of
segovia
were
out
of
sight
we
swept
up
the
guadarrama
mountains
and
down
by
the
escurial
and
we
skirted
the
walls
of
madrid
and
we
scoured
away
across
the
plains
of
la
mancha
in
this
way
we
went
up
hill
and
down
dale
by
towers
and
cities
all
buried
in
deep
sleep
and
across
mountains
and
plains
and
rivers
just
glimmering
in
the
starlight
to
make
a
long
story
short
and
not
to
fatigue
your
excellency
the
trooper
suddenly
pulled
up
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
here
we
are
said
he
at
the
end
of
our
i
looked
about
but
could
see
no
signs
of
habitation
nothing
but
the
mouth
of
a
cavern
while
i
looked
i
saw
multitudes
of
people
in
moorish
dresses
some
on
horseback
some
on
foot
arriving
as
if
borne
by
the
wind
from
all
points
of
the
compass
and
hurrying
into
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
like
bees
into
a
hive
before
i
could
ask
a
question
the
trooper
struck
his
long
moorish
spurs
into
the
horse
s
flanks
and
dashed
in
with
the
throng
we
passed
along
a
steep
winding
way
that
descended
into
the
very
bowels
of
the
mountain
as
we
pushed
on
a
light
began
to
glimmer
up
by
little
and
little
like
the
first
glimmerings
of
day
but
what
caused
it
i
could
not
discern
it
grew
stronger
and
stronger
and
enabled
me
to
see
everything
around
i
now
noticed
as
we
passed
along
great
caverns
opening
to
the
right
and
left
like
halls
in
an
arsenal
in
some
there
were
shields
and
helmets
and
cuirasses
and
lances
and
cimeters
hanging
against
the
walls
in
others
there
were
great
heaps
of
warlike
munitions
and
lying
upon
the
ground
it
would
have
done
your
excellency
s
heart
good
being
an
old
soldier
to
have
seen
such
grand
provision
for
war
then
in
other
caverns
there
were
long
rows
of
horsemen
armed
to
the
teeth
with
lances
raised
and
banners
unfurled
all
ready
for
the
field
but
they
all
sat
motionless
in
their
saddles
like
so
many
statues
in
other
halls
were
warriors
sleeping
on
the
ground
beside
their
horses
and
in
groups
ready
to
fall
into
the
ranks
all
were
in
moorish
dresses
and
armor
well
your
excellency
to
cut
a
long
story
short
we
at
length
entered
an
immense
cavern
or
i
may
say
palace
of
the
walls
of
which
seemed
to
be
veined
with
gold
and
silver
and
to
sparkle
with
diamonds
and
sapphires
and
all
kinds
of
precious
stones
at
the
upper
end
sat
a
moorish
king
on
a
golden
throne
with
his
nobles
on
each
side
and
a
guard
of
african
blacks
with
drawn
cimeters
all
the
crowd
that
continued
to
flock
in
and
amounted
to
thousands
and
thousands
passed
one
by
one
before
his
throne
each
paying
homage
as
he
passed
some
of
the
multitude
were
dressed
in
magnificent
robes
without
stain
or
blemish
and
sparkling
with
jewels
others
in
burnished
and
enamelled
armor
while
others
were
in
mouldered
and
mildewed
garments
and
in
armor
all
battered
and
dented
and
covered
with
rust
i
had
hitherto
held
my
tongue
for
your
excellency
well
knows
it
is
not
for
a
soldier
to
ask
many
questions
when
on
duty
but
i
could
keep
silent
no
longer
prithee
comrade
said
i
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
this
said
the
trooper
is
a
great
and
fearful
mystery
know
o
christian
that
you
see
before
you
the
court
and
army
of
boabdil
the
last
king
of
what
is
this
you
tell
me
cried
i
boabdil
and
his
court
were
exiled
from
the
land
hundreds
of
years
agone
and
all
died
in
so
it
is
recorded
in
your
lying
chronicles
replied
the
moor
but
know
that
boabdil
and
the
warriors
who
made
the
last
struggle
for
granada
were
all
shut
up
in
the
mountain
by
powerful
enchantment
as
for
the
king
and
army
that
marched
forth
from
granada
at
the
time
of
the
surrender
they
were
a
mere
phantom
train
of
spirits
and
demons
permitted
to
assume
those
shapes
to
deceive
the
christian
sovereigns
and
furthermore
let
me
tell
you
friend
that
all
spain
is
a
country
under
the
power
of
enchantment
there
is
not
a
mountain
cave
not
a
lonely
in
the
plains
nor
ruined
castle
on
the
hills
but
has
some
warriors
sleeping
from
age
to
age
within
its
vaults
until
the
sins
are
expiated
for
which
allah
permitted
the
dominion
to
pass
for
a
time
out
of
the
hands
of
the
faithful
once
every
year
on
the
eve
of
john
they
are
released
from
enchantment
from
sunset
to
sunrise
and
permitted
to
repair
here
to
pay
homage
to
their
sovereign
and
the
crowds
which
you
beheld
swarming
into
the
cavern
are
moslem
warriors
from
their
haunts
in
all
parts
of
spain
for
my
own
part
you
saw
the
ruined
tower
of
the
bridge
in
old
castile
where
i
have
now
wintered
and
summered
for
many
hundred
years
and
where
i
must
be
back
again
by
daybreak
as
to
the
battalions
of
horse
and
foot
which
you
beheld
drawn
up
in
array
in
the
neighboring
caverns
they
are
the
warriors
of
granada
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
fate
that
when
the
enchantment
is
broken
boabdil
will
descend
from
the
mountain
at
the
head
of
this
army
resume
his
throne
in
the
alhambra
and
his
sway
of
granada
and
gathering
together
the
enchanted
warriors
from
all
parts
of
spain
will
reconquer
the
peninsula
and
restore
it
to
moslem
and
when
shall
this
happen
said
i
allah
alone
knows
we
had
hoped
the
day
of
deliverance
was
at
hand
but
there
reigns
at
present
a
vigilant
governor
in
the
alhambra
a
stanch
old
soldier
well
known
as
governor
manco
while
such
a
warrior
holds
command
of
the
very
outpost
and
stands
ready
to
check
the
first
irruption
from
the
mountain
i
fear
boabdil
and
his
soldiery
must
be
content
to
rest
upon
their
here
the
governor
raised
himself
somewhat
perpendicularly
adjusted
his
sword
and
twirled
up
his
moustaches
to
make
a
long
story
short
and
not
to
fatigue
your
excellency
the
trooper
having
given
me
this
account
dismounted
from
his
steed
tarry
here
said
he
and
guard
my
steed
while
i
go
and
bow
the
knee
to
so
saying
he
strode
away
among
the
throng
that
pressed
forward
to
the
throne
what
s
to
be
done
thought
i
when
thus
left
to
myself
shall
i
wait
here
until
this
infidel
returns
to
whisk
me
off
on
his
goblin
steed
the
lord
knows
where
or
shall
i
make
the
most
of
my
time
and
beat
a
retreat
from
this
hobgoblin
community
a
soldier
s
mind
is
soon
made
up
as
your
excellency
well
knows
as
to
the
horse
he
belonged
to
an
avowed
enemy
of
the
faith
and
the
realm
and
was
a
fair
prize
according
to
the
rules
of
war
so
hoisting
myself
from
the
crupper
into
the
saddle
i
turned
the
reins
struck
the
moorish
stirrups
into
the
sides
of
the
steed
and
put
him
to
make
the
best
of
his
way
out
of
the
passage
by
which
he
had
entered
as
we
scoured
by
the
halls
where
the
moslem
horsemen
sat
in
motionless
battalions
i
thought
i
heard
the
clang
of
armor
and
a
hollow
murmur
of
voices
i
gave
the
steed
another
taste
of
the
stirrups
and
doubled
my
speed
there
was
now
a
sound
behind
me
like
a
rushing
blast
i
heard
the
clatter
of
a
thousand
hoofs
a
countless
throng
overtook
me
i
was
borne
along
in
the
press
and
hurled
forth
from
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
while
thousands
of
shadowy
forms
were
swept
off
in
every
direction
by
the
four
winds
of
heaven
in
the
whirl
and
confusion
of
the
scene
i
was
thrown
senseless
to
the
earth
when
i
came
to
myself
i
was
lying
on
the
brow
of
a
hill
with
the
arabian
steed
standing
beside
me
for
in
falling
my
arm
had
slipped
within
the
bridle
which
i
presume
prevented
his
whisking
off
to
old
castile
your
excellency
may
easily
judge
of
my
surprise
on
looking
round
to
behold
hedges
of
aloes
and
indian
figs
and
other
proofs
of
a
southern
climate
and
to
see
a
great
city
below
me
with
towers
and
palaces
and
a
grand
cathedral
i
descended
the
hill
cautiously
leading
my
steed
for
i
was
afraid
to
mount
him
again
lest
he
should
play
me
some
slippery
trick
as
i
descended
i
met
with
your
patrol
who
let
me
into
the
secret
that
it
was
granada
that
lay
before
me
and
that
i
was
actually
under
the
walls
of
the
alhambra
the
fortress
of
the
redoubted
governor
manco
the
terror
of
all
enchanted
moslems
when
i
heard
this
i
determined
at
once
to
seek
your
excellency
to
inform
you
of
all
that
i
had
seen
and
to
warn
you
of
the
perils
that
surround
and
undermine
you
that
you
may
take
measures
in
time
to
guard
your
fortress
and
the
kingdom
itself
from
this
intestine
army
that
lurks
in
the
very
bowels
of
the
and
prithee
friend
you
who
are
a
veteran
campaigner
and
have
seen
so
much
service
said
the
governor
how
would
you
advise
me
to
proceed
in
order
to
prevent
this
evil
it
is
not
for
a
humble
private
of
the
ranks
said
the
soldier
modestly
to
pretend
to
instruct
a
commander
of
your
excellency
s
sagacity
but
it
appears
to
me
that
your
excellency
might
cause
all
the
caves
and
entrances
into
the
mountains
to
be
walled
up
with
solid
so
that
boabdil
and
his
army
might
be
completely
corked
up
in
their
subterranean
habitation
if
the
good
father
too
added
the
soldier
reverently
bowing
to
the
friar
and
devoutly
crossing
himself
would
consecrate
the
barricadoes
with
his
blessing
and
put
up
a
few
crosses
and
relics
and
images
of
saints
i
think
they
might
withstand
all
the
power
of
infidel
they
doubtless
would
be
of
great
avail
said
the
friar
the
governor
now
placed
his
arm
akimbo
with
his
hand
resting
on
the
hilt
of
his
toledo
fixed
his
eye
upon
the
soldier
and
gently
wagging
his
head
from
one
side
to
the
other
so
friend
said
he
then
you
really
suppose
i
am
to
be
gulled
with
this
story
about
enchanted
mountains
and
enchanted
moors
hark
ye
culprit
not
another
word
an
old
soldier
you
may
be
but
you
ll
find
you
have
an
older
soldier
to
deal
with
and
one
not
easily
outgeneralled
ho
guards
there
put
this
fellow
in
the
demure
handmaid
would
have
put
in
a
word
in
favor
of
the
prisoner
but
the
governor
silenced
her
with
a
look
as
they
were
pinioning
the
soldier
one
of
the
guards
felt
something
of
bulk
in
his
pocket
and
drawing
it
forth
found
a
long
leathern
purse
that
appeared
to
be
well
filled
holding
it
by
one
corner
he
turned
out
the
contents
upon
the
table
before
the
governor
and
never
did
freebooter
s
bag
make
more
gorgeous
delivery
out
tumbled
rings
and
jewels
and
rosaries
of
pearls
and
sparkling
diamond
crosses
and
a
profusion
of
ancient
golden
coin
some
of
which
fell
jingling
to
the
floor
and
rolled
away
to
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
chamber
for
a
time
the
functions
of
justice
were
suspended
there
was
a
universal
scramble
after
the
glittering
fugitives
the
governor
alone
who
was
imbued
with
true
spanish
pride
maintained
his
stately
decorum
though
his
eye
betrayed
a
little
anxiety
until
the
last
coin
and
jewel
was
restored
to
the
sack
the
friar
was
not
so
calm
his
whole
face
glowed
like
a
furnace
and
his
eyes
twinkled
and
flashed
at
sight
of
the
rosaries
and
crosses
sacrilegious
wretch
that
thou
art
exclaimed
he
what
church
or
sanctuary
hast
thou
been
plundering
of
these
sacred
relics
neither
one
nor
the
other
holy
father
if
they
be
sacrilegious
spoils
they
must
have
been
taken
in
times
long
past
by
the
infidel
trooper
i
have
mentioned
i
was
just
going
to
tell
his
excellency
when
he
interrupted
me
that
on
taking
possession
of
the
trooper
s
horse
i
unhooked
a
leathern
sack
which
hung
at
the
and
which
i
presume
contained
the
plunder
of
his
campaignings
in
days
of
old
when
the
moors
overran
the
mighty
well
at
present
you
will
make
up
your
mind
to
take
up
your
quarters
in
a
chamber
of
the
vermilion
tower
which
though
not
under
a
magic
spell
will
hold
you
as
safe
as
any
cave
of
your
enchanted
your
excellency
will
do
as
you
think
proper
said
the
prisoner
coolly
i
shall
be
thankful
to
your
excellency
for
any
accommodation
in
the
fortress
a
soldier
who
has
been
in
the
wars
as
your
excellency
well
knows
is
not
particular
about
his
lodgings
provided
i
have
a
snug
dungeon
and
regular
rations
i
shall
manage
to
make
myself
comfortable
i
would
only
entreat
that
while
your
excellency
is
so
careful
about
me
you
would
have
an
eye
to
your
fortress
and
think
on
the
hint
i
dropped
about
stopping
up
the
entrances
to
the
here
ended
the
scene
the
prisoner
was
conducted
to
a
strong
dungeon
in
the
vermilion
tower
the
arabian
steed
was
led
to
his
excellency
s
stable
and
the
trooper
s
sack
was
deposited
in
his
excellency
s
strong
box
to
the
latter
it
is
true
the
friar
made
some
demur
questioning
whether
the
sacred
relics
which
were
evidently
sacrilegious
spoils
should
not
be
placed
in
custody
of
the
church
but
as
the
governor
was
peremptory
on
the
subject
and
was
absolute
lord
in
the
alhambra
the
friar
discreetly
dropped
the
discussion
but
determined
to
convey
intelligence
of
the
fact
to
the
church
dignitaries
in
granada
to
explain
these
prompt
and
rigid
measures
on
the
part
of
old
governor
manco
it
is
proper
to
observe
that
about
this
time
the
alpuxarra
mountains
in
the
neighborhood
of
granada
were
terribly
infested
by
a
gang
of
robbers
under
the
command
of
a
daring
chief
named
manuel
borasco
who
were
accustomed
to
prowl
about
the
country
and
even
to
enter
the
city
in
various
disguises
to
gain
intelligence
of
the
departure
of
convoys
of
merchandise
or
travellers
with
purses
whom
they
took
care
to
waylay
in
distant
and
solitary
passes
of
the
road
these
repeated
and
daring
outrages
had
awakened
the
attention
of
government
and
the
commanders
of
the
various
posts
had
received
instructions
to
be
on
the
alert
and
to
take
up
all
suspicious
stragglers
governor
manco
was
particularly
zealous
in
consequence
of
the
various
stigmas
that
had
been
cast
upon
his
fortress
and
he
now
doubted
not
he
had
entrapped
some
formidable
desperado
of
this
gang
in
the
mean
time
the
story
took
wind
and
became
the
talk
not
merely
of
the
fortress
but
of
the
whole
city
of
granada
it
was
said
that
the
noted
robber
manuel
borasco
the
terror
of
the
alpuxarras
had
fallen
into
the
clutches
of
old
governor
manco
and
been
cooped
up
by
him
in
a
dungeon
of
the
vermilion
towers
and
every
one
who
had
been
robbed
by
him
flocked
to
recognize
the
marauder
the
vermilion
towers
as
is
well
known
stand
apart
from
the
alhambra
on
a
sister
hill
separated
from
the
main
fortress
by
the
ravine
down
which
passes
the
main
avenue
there
were
no
outer
walls
but
a
sentinel
patrolled
before
the
tower
the
window
of
the
chamber
in
which
the
soldier
was
confined
was
strongly
grated
and
looked
upon
a
small
esplanade
here
the
good
folks
of
granada
repaired
to
gaze
at
him
as
they
would
at
a
laughing
hyena
grinning
through
the
cage
of
a
menagerie
nobody
however
recognized
him
for
manuel
borasco
for
that
terrible
robber
was
noted
for
a
ferocious
physiognomy
and
had
by
no
means
the
squint
of
the
prisoner
visitors
came
not
merely
from
the
city
but
from
all
parts
of
the
country
but
nobody
knew
him
and
there
began
to
be
doubts
in
the
minds
of
the
common
people
whether
there
might
not
be
some
truth
in
his
story
that
boabdil
and
his
army
were
shut
up
in
the
mountain
was
an
old
tradition
which
many
of
the
ancient
inhabitants
had
heard
from
their
fathers
numbers
went
up
to
the
mountain
of
the
sun
or
rather
of
elena
in
search
of
the
cave
mentioned
by
the
soldier
and
saw
and
peeped
into
the
deep
dark
pit
descending
no
one
knows
how
far
into
the
mountain
and
which
remains
there
to
this
day
the
fabled
entrance
to
the
subterranean
abode
of
boabdil
by
degrees
the
soldier
became
popular
with
the
common
people
a
freebooter
of
the
mountains
is
by
no
means
the
opprobrious
character
in
spain
that
a
robber
is
in
any
other
country
on
the
contrary
he
is
a
kind
of
chivalrous
personage
in
the
eyes
of
the
lower
classes
there
is
always
a
disposition
also
to
cavil
at
the
conduct
of
those
in
command
and
many
began
to
murmur
at
the
measures
of
old
governor
manco
and
to
look
upon
the
prisoner
in
the
light
of
a
martyr
the
soldier
moreover
was
a
merry
waggish
fellow
that
had
a
joke
for
every
one
who
came
near
his
window
and
a
soft
speech
for
every
female
he
had
procured
an
old
guitar
also
and
would
sit
by
his
window
and
sing
ballads
and
to
the
delight
of
the
women
of
the
neighborhood
who
would
assemble
on
the
esplanade
in
the
evening
and
dance
boleros
to
his
music
having
trimmed
off
his
rough
beard
his
sunburnt
face
found
favor
in
the
eyes
of
the
fair
and
the
demure
handmaid
of
the
governor
declared
that
his
squint
was
perfectly
irresistible
this
damsel
had
from
the
first
evinced
a
deep
sympathy
in
his
fortunes
and
having
in
vain
tried
to
mollify
the
governor
had
set
to
work
privately
to
mitigate
the
rigor
of
his
dispensations
every
day
she
brought
the
prisoner
some
crumbs
of
comfort
which
had
fallen
from
the
governor
s
table
or
been
abstracted
from
his
larder
together
with
now
and
then
a
consoling
bottle
of
choice
val
de
peñas
or
rich
malaga
while
this
petty
treason
was
going
on
in
the
very
centre
of
the
old
governor
s
citadel
a
storm
of
open
war
was
brewing
up
among
his
external
foes
the
circumstance
of
a
bag
of
gold
and
jewels
having
been
found
upon
the
person
of
the
supposed
robber
had
been
reported
with
many
exaggerations
in
granada
a
question
of
territorial
jurisdiction
was
immediately
started
by
the
governor
s
inveterate
rival
the
he
insisted
that
the
prisoner
had
been
captured
without
the
precincts
of
the
alhambra
and
within
the
rules
of
his
authority
he
demanded
his
body
therefore
and
the
taken
with
him
due
information
having
been
carried
likewise
by
the
friar
to
the
grand
inquisitor
of
the
crosses
and
rosaries
and
other
relics
contained
in
the
bag
he
claimed
the
culprit
as
having
been
guilty
of
sacrilege
and
insisted
that
his
plunder
was
due
to
the
church
and
his
body
to
the
next
the
feuds
ran
high
the
governor
was
furious
and
swore
rather
than
surrender
his
captive
he
would
hang
him
up
within
the
alhambra
as
a
spy
caught
within
the
purlieus
of
the
fortress
the
threatened
to
send
a
body
of
soldiers
to
transfer
the
prisoner
from
the
vermilion
tower
to
the
city
the
grand
inquisitor
was
equally
bent
upon
dispatching
a
number
of
the
familiars
of
the
holy
office
word
was
brought
late
at
night
to
the
governor
of
these
machinations
let
them
come
said
he
they
ll
find
me
beforehand
with
them
he
must
rise
bright
and
early
who
would
take
in
an
old
he
accordingly
issued
orders
to
have
the
prisoner
removed
at
daybreak
to
the
within
the
walls
of
the
alhambra
and
d
ye
hear
child
said
he
to
his
demure
handmaid
tap
at
my
door
and
wake
me
before
that
i
may
see
to
the
matter
the
day
dawned
the
cock
crowed
but
nobody
tapped
at
the
door
of
the
governor
the
sun
rose
high
above
the
and
glittered
in
at
his
casement
ere
the
governor
was
awakened
from
his
morning
dreams
by
his
veteran
corporal
who
stood
before
him
with
terror
stamped
upon
his
iron
visage
he
s
off
he
s
gone
cried
the
corporal
gasping
for
breath
who
s
off
who
s
gone
the
soldier
the
robber
the
devil
for
aught
i
know
his
dungeon
is
empty
but
the
door
locked
no
one
knows
how
he
has
escaped
out
of
who
saw
him
last
your
handmaid
she
brought
him
his
let
her
be
called
here
was
new
matter
of
confusion
the
chamber
of
the
demure
damsel
was
likewise
empty
her
bed
had
not
been
slept
in
she
had
doubtless
gone
off
with
the
culprit
as
she
had
appeared
for
some
days
past
to
have
frequent
conversations
with
him
this
was
wounding
the
old
governor
in
a
tender
part
but
he
had
scarce
time
to
wince
at
it
when
new
misfortunes
broke
upon
his
view
on
going
into
his
cabinet
he
found
his
strong
box
open
the
leather
purse
of
the
trooper
abstracted
and
with
it
a
couple
of
corpulent
bags
of
doubloons
but
how
and
which
way
had
the
fugitives
escaped
an
old
peasant
who
lived
in
a
cottage
by
the
leading
up
into
the
sierra
declared
that
he
had
heard
the
tramp
of
a
powerful
steed
just
before
daybreak
passing
up
into
the
mountains
he
had
looked
out
at
his
casement
and
could
just
distinguish
a
horseman
with
a
female
seated
before
him
search
the
stables
cried
governor
manco
the
stables
were
searched
all
the
horses
were
in
their
stalls
excepting
the
arabian
steed
in
his
place
was
a
stout
cudgel
tied
to
the
manger
and
on
it
a
label
bearing
these
words
a
gift
to
governor
manco
from
an
old
a
fête
in
the
alhambra
the
saint
s
day
of
my
neighbor
and
rival
potentate
the
count
took
place
during
his
sojourn
in
the
alhambra
on
which
occasion
he
gave
a
domestic
fête
assembling
round
him
the
members
of
his
family
and
household
while
the
stewards
and
old
servants
from
his
distant
possessions
came
to
pay
him
reverence
and
partake
of
the
good
cheer
which
was
sure
to
be
provided
it
presented
a
type
though
doubtless
a
faint
one
of
the
establishment
of
a
spanish
noble
in
the
olden
time
the
spaniards
were
always
grandiose
in
their
notions
of
style
huge
palaces
lumbering
equipages
laden
with
footmen
and
lackeys
pompous
retinues
and
useless
dependents
of
all
kinds
the
dignity
of
a
noble
seemed
commensurate
with
the
legions
who
loitered
about
his
halls
fed
at
his
expense
and
seemed
ready
to
devour
him
alive
this
doubtless
originated
in
the
necessity
of
keeping
up
hosts
of
armed
retainers
during
the
wars
with
the
moors
wars
of
inroads
and
surprises
when
a
noble
was
liable
to
be
suddenly
assailed
in
his
castle
by
a
foray
of
the
enemy
or
summoned
to
the
field
by
his
sovereign
the
custom
remained
after
the
wars
were
at
an
end
and
what
originated
in
necessity
was
kept
up
through
ostentation
the
wealth
which
flowed
into
the
country
from
conquests
and
discoveries
fostered
the
passion
for
princely
establishments
according
to
magnificent
old
spanish
usage
in
which
pride
and
generosity
bore
equal
parts
a
superannuated
servant
was
never
turned
off
but
became
a
charge
for
the
rest
of
his
days
nay
his
children
and
his
children
s
children
and
often
their
relatives
to
the
right
and
left
became
gradually
entailed
upon
the
family
hence
the
huge
palaces
of
the
spanish
nobility
which
have
such
an
air
of
empty
ostentation
from
the
greatness
of
their
size
compared
with
the
mediocrity
and
scantiness
of
their
furniture
were
absolutely
required
in
the
golden
days
of
spain
by
the
patriarchal
habits
of
their
possessors
they
were
little
better
than
vast
barracks
for
their
hereditary
generations
of
that
battened
at
the
expense
of
a
spanish
noble
these
patriarchal
habits
of
the
spanish
nobility
have
declined
with
their
revenues
though
the
spirit
which
prompted
them
remains
and
wars
sadly
with
their
altered
fortunes
the
poorest
among
them
have
always
some
hereditary
who
live
at
their
expense
and
make
them
poorer
some
who
like
my
neighbor
the
count
retain
a
modicum
of
their
once
princely
possessions
keep
up
a
shadow
of
the
ancient
system
and
their
estates
are
overrun
and
the
produce
consumed
by
generations
of
idle
retainers
the
count
held
estates
in
various
parts
of
the
kingdom
some
including
whole
villages
yet
the
revenues
collected
from
them
were
comparatively
small
some
of
them
he
assured
me
barely
fed
the
hordes
of
dependents
nestled
upon
them
who
seemed
to
consider
themselves
entitled
to
live
and
be
maintained
into
the
bargain
because
their
forefathers
had
been
so
since
time
immemorial
the
saint
s
day
of
the
old
count
gave
me
a
glimpse
into
a
spanish
interior
for
two
or
three
days
previous
preparations
were
made
for
the
fête
viands
of
all
kinds
were
brought
up
from
town
greeting
the
olfactory
nerves
of
the
old
invalid
guards
as
they
were
borne
past
them
through
the
gate
of
justice
servants
hurried
officiously
about
the
courts
the
ancient
kitchen
of
the
palace
was
again
alive
with
the
tread
of
cooks
and
scullions
and
blazed
with
unwonted
fires
when
the
day
arrived
i
beheld
the
old
count
in
patriarchal
state
his
family
and
household
around
him
with
functionaries
who
mismanaged
his
estates
at
a
distance
and
consumed
the
proceeds
while
numerous
old
servants
and
pensioners
were
loitering
about
the
courts
and
keeping
within
smell
of
the
kitchen
it
was
a
joyous
day
in
the
alhambra
the
guests
dispersed
themselves
about
the
palace
before
the
hour
of
dinner
enjoying
the
luxuries
of
its
courts
and
fountains
and
embosomed
gardens
and
music
and
laughter
resounded
through
its
late
silent
halls
the
feast
for
a
set
dinner
in
spain
is
literally
a
feast
was
served
in
the
beautiful
morisco
hall
of
las
dos
the
table
was
loaded
with
all
the
luxuries
of
the
season
there
was
an
almost
interminable
succession
of
dishes
showing
how
truly
the
feast
at
the
rich
camachos
wedding
in
don
quixote
was
a
picture
of
a
spanish
banquet
a
joyous
conviviality
prevailed
round
the
board
for
though
spaniards
are
generally
abstemious
they
are
complete
revellers
on
occasions
like
the
present
and
none
more
so
than
the
andalusians
for
my
part
there
was
something
peculiarly
exciting
in
thus
sitting
at
a
feast
in
the
royal
halls
of
the
alhambra
given
by
one
who
might
claim
remote
affinity
with
its
moorish
kings
and
who
was
a
lineal
representative
of
gonsalvo
of
cordova
one
of
the
most
distinguished
of
the
christian
conquerors
the
banquet
ended
the
company
adjourned
to
the
hall
of
ambassadors
here
every
one
endeavored
to
contribute
to
the
general
amusement
singing
improvising
telling
wonderful
tales
or
dancing
popular
dances
to
that
talisman
of
spanish
pleasure
the
guitar
the
count
s
gifted
little
daughter
was
as
usual
the
life
and
delight
of
the
assemblage
and
i
was
more
than
ever
struck
with
her
aptness
and
wonderful
versatility
she
took
a
part
in
two
or
three
scenes
of
elegant
comedy
with
some
of
her
companions
and
performed
them
with
exquisite
point
and
finished
grace
she
gave
imitations
of
the
popular
italian
singers
some
serious
some
comic
with
a
rare
quality
of
voice
and
i
was
assured
with
singular
fidelity
she
imitated
the
dialects
dances
ballads
and
movements
and
manners
of
the
gypsies
and
the
peasants
of
the
vega
with
equal
felicity
but
everything
was
done
with
an
grace
and
a
ladylike
tact
perfectly
fascinating
the
great
charm
of
everything
she
did
was
its
freedom
from
pretension
or
ambitious
display
its
happy
spontaneity
everything
sprang
from
the
impulse
of
the
moment
or
was
in
prompt
compliance
with
a
request
she
seemed
unconscious
of
the
rarity
and
extent
of
her
own
talent
and
was
like
a
child
at
home
revelling
in
the
buoyancy
of
its
own
gay
and
innocent
spirits
indeed
i
was
told
she
had
never
exerted
her
talents
in
general
society
but
only
as
at
present
in
the
domestic
circle
her
faculty
of
observation
and
her
perception
of
character
must
have
been
remarkably
quick
for
she
could
have
had
only
casual
and
transient
glances
at
the
scenes
manners
and
customs
depicted
with
such
truth
and
spirit
indeed
it
is
a
continual
wonder
to
us
said
the
countess
where
the
child
la
niña
has
picked
up
these
things
her
life
being
passed
almost
entirely
at
home
in
the
bosom
of
the
evening
approached
twilight
began
to
throw
its
shadows
about
the
halls
and
the
bats
to
steal
forth
from
their
and
flit
about
a
notion
seized
the
little
damsel
and
some
of
her
youthful
companions
to
set
out
under
the
guidance
of
dolores
and
explore
the
less
frequented
parts
of
the
palace
in
quest
of
mysteries
and
enchantments
thus
conducted
they
peeped
fearfully
into
the
gloomy
old
mosque
but
quick
drew
back
on
being
told
that
a
moorish
king
had
been
murdered
there
they
ventured
into
the
mysterious
regions
of
the
bath
frightening
themselves
with
the
sounds
and
murmurs
of
hidden
aqueducts
and
flying
with
mock
panic
at
the
alarm
of
phantom
moors
they
then
undertook
the
adventure
of
the
iron
gate
a
place
of
baleful
note
in
the
alhambra
it
is
a
postern
gate
opening
into
a
dark
ravine
a
narrow
covered
way
leads
down
to
it
which
used
to
be
the
terror
of
dolores
and
her
playmates
in
childhood
as
it
was
said
a
hand
without
a
body
would
sometimes
be
stretched
out
from
the
wall
and
seize
hold
of
the
the
little
party
of
ventured
to
the
entrance
of
the
covered
way
but
nothing
would
tempt
them
to
enter
in
this
hour
of
gathering
gloom
they
dreaded
the
grasp
of
the
phantom
arm
at
length
they
came
running
back
into
the
hall
of
ambassadors
in
a
mock
paroxysm
of
terror
they
had
positively
seen
two
spectral
figures
all
in
white
they
had
not
stopped
to
examine
them
but
could
not
be
mistaken
for
they
glared
distinctly
through
the
surrounding
gloom
dolores
soon
arrived
and
explained
the
mystery
the
spectres
proved
to
be
two
statues
of
nymphs
in
white
marble
placed
at
the
entrance
of
a
vaulted
passage
upon
this
a
grave
but
as
i
thought
somewhat
sly
old
gentleman
present
who
i
believe
was
the
count
s
advocate
or
legal
adviser
assured
them
that
these
statues
were
connected
with
one
of
the
greatest
mysteries
of
the
alhambra
that
there
was
a
curious
history
concerning
them
and
moreover
that
they
stood
a
living
monument
in
marble
of
female
secrecy
and
discretion
all
present
entreated
him
to
tell
the
history
of
the
statues
he
took
a
little
time
to
recollect
the
details
and
then
gave
them
in
substance
the
following
legend
legend
of
the
two
discreet
statues
there
lived
once
in
a
waste
apartment
of
the
alhambra
a
merry
little
fellow
named
lope
sanchez
who
worked
in
the
gardens
and
was
as
brisk
and
blithe
as
a
grasshopper
singing
all
day
long
he
was
the
life
and
soul
of
the
fortress
when
his
work
was
over
he
would
sit
on
one
of
the
stone
benches
of
the
esplanade
strum
his
guitar
and
sing
long
ditties
about
the
cid
and
bernardo
del
carpio
and
fernando
del
pulgar
and
other
spanish
heroes
for
the
amusement
of
the
old
soldiers
of
the
fortress
or
would
strike
up
a
merrier
tune
and
set
the
girls
dancing
boleros
and
fandangos
like
most
little
men
lope
sanchez
had
a
strapping
buxom
dame
for
a
wife
who
could
almost
have
put
him
in
her
pocket
but
he
lacked
the
usual
poor
man
s
lot
instead
of
ten
children
he
had
but
one
this
was
a
little
girl
about
twelve
years
of
age
named
sanchica
who
was
as
merry
as
himself
and
the
delight
of
his
heart
she
played
about
him
as
he
worked
in
the
gardens
danced
to
his
guitar
as
he
sat
in
the
shade
and
ran
as
wild
as
a
young
fawn
about
the
groves
and
alleys
and
ruined
halls
of
the
alhambra
it
was
now
the
eve
of
the
blessed
john
and
the
gossips
of
the
alhambra
men
women
and
children
went
up
at
night
to
the
mountain
of
the
sun
which
rises
above
the
generalife
to
keep
their
midsummer
vigil
on
its
level
summit
it
was
a
bright
moonlight
night
and
all
the
mountains
were
gray
and
silvery
and
the
city
with
its
domes
and
spires
lay
in
shadows
below
and
the
vega
was
like
a
fairy
land
with
haunted
streams
gleaming
among
its
dusky
groves
on
the
highest
part
of
the
mountain
they
lit
up
a
bonfire
according
to
an
old
custom
of
the
country
handed
down
from
the
moors
the
inhabitants
of
the
surrounding
country
were
keeping
a
similar
vigil
and
bonfires
here
and
there
in
the
vega
and
along
the
folds
of
the
mountains
blazed
up
palely
in
the
moonlight
the
evening
was
gayly
passed
in
dancing
to
the
guitar
of
lope
sanchez
who
was
never
so
joyous
as
when
on
a
holiday
revel
of
the
kind
while
the
dance
was
going
on
the
little
sanchica
with
some
of
her
playmates
sported
among
the
ruins
of
an
old
moorish
fort
that
crowns
the
mountain
when
in
gathering
pebbles
in
the
fosse
she
found
a
small
hand
curiously
carved
of
jet
the
fingers
closed
and
the
thumb
firmly
clasped
upon
them
overjoyed
with
her
good
fortune
she
ran
to
her
mother
with
her
prize
it
immediately
became
a
subject
of
sage
speculation
and
was
eyed
by
some
with
superstitious
distrust
throw
it
away
said
one
it
s
moorish
depend
upon
it
there
s
mischief
and
witchcraft
in
by
no
means
said
another
you
may
sell
it
for
something
to
the
jewellers
of
the
in
the
midst
of
this
discussion
an
old
tawny
soldier
drew
near
who
had
served
in
africa
and
was
as
swarthy
as
a
moor
he
examined
the
hand
with
a
knowing
look
i
have
seen
things
of
this
kind
said
he
among
the
moors
of
barbary
it
is
a
great
virtue
to
guard
against
the
evil
eye
and
all
kinds
of
spells
and
enchantments
i
give
you
joy
friend
lope
this
bodes
good
luck
to
your
upon
hearing
this
the
wife
of
lope
sanchez
tied
the
little
hand
of
jet
to
a
ribbon
and
hung
it
round
the
neck
of
her
daughter
the
sight
of
this
talisman
called
up
all
the
favorite
superstitions
about
the
moors
the
dance
was
neglected
and
they
sat
in
groups
on
the
ground
telling
old
legendary
tales
handed
down
from
their
ancestors
some
of
their
stories
turned
upon
the
wonders
of
the
very
mountain
upon
which
they
were
seated
which
is
a
famous
hobgoblin
region
one
ancient
crone
gave
a
long
account
of
the
subterranean
palace
in
the
bowels
of
that
mountain
where
boabdil
and
all
his
moslem
court
are
said
to
remain
enchanted
among
yonder
ruins
said
she
pointing
to
some
crumbling
walls
and
mounds
of
earth
on
a
distant
part
of
the
mountain
there
is
a
deep
black
pit
that
goes
down
down
into
the
very
heart
of
the
mountain
for
all
the
money
in
granada
i
would
not
look
down
into
it
once
upon
a
time
a
poor
man
of
the
alhambra
who
tended
goats
upon
this
mountain
scrambled
down
into
that
pit
after
a
kid
that
had
fallen
in
he
came
out
again
all
wild
and
staring
and
told
such
things
of
what
he
had
seen
that
every
one
thought
his
brain
was
turned
he
raved
for
a
day
or
two
about
the
hobgoblin
moors
that
had
pursued
him
in
the
cavern
and
could
hardly
be
persuaded
to
drive
his
goats
up
again
to
the
mountain
he
did
so
at
last
but
poor
man
he
never
came
down
again
the
neighbors
found
his
goats
browsing
about
the
moorish
ruins
and
his
hat
and
mantle
lying
near
the
mouth
of
the
pit
but
he
was
never
more
heard
the
little
sanchica
listened
with
breathless
attention
to
this
story
she
was
of
a
curious
nature
and
felt
immediately
a
great
hankering
to
peep
into
this
dangerous
pit
stealing
away
from
her
companions
she
sought
the
distant
ruins
and
after
groping
for
some
time
among
them
came
to
a
small
hollow
or
basin
near
the
brow
of
the
mountain
where
it
swept
steeply
down
into
the
valley
of
the
darro
in
the
centre
of
this
basin
yawned
the
mouth
of
the
pit
sanchica
ventured
to
the
verge
and
peeped
in
all
was
as
black
as
pitch
and
gave
an
idea
of
immeasurable
depth
her
blood
ran
cold
she
drew
back
then
peeped
in
again
then
would
have
run
away
then
took
another
peep
the
very
horror
of
the
thing
was
delightful
to
her
at
length
she
rolled
a
large
stone
and
pushed
it
over
the
brink
for
some
time
it
fell
in
silence
then
struck
some
rocky
projection
with
a
violent
crash
then
rebounded
from
side
to
side
rumbling
and
tumbling
with
a
noise
like
thunder
then
made
a
final
splash
into
water
far
far
below
and
all
was
again
silent
the
silence
however
did
not
long
continue
it
seemed
as
if
something
had
been
awakened
within
this
dreary
abyss
a
murmuring
sound
gradually
rose
out
of
the
pit
like
the
hum
and
buzz
of
a
beehive
it
grew
louder
and
louder
there
was
the
confusion
of
voices
as
of
a
distant
multitude
together
with
the
faint
din
of
arms
clash
of
cymbals
and
clangor
of
trumpets
as
if
some
army
were
marshalling
for
battle
in
the
very
bowels
of
the
mountain
the
child
drew
off
with
silent
awe
and
hastened
back
to
the
place
where
she
had
left
her
parents
and
their
companions
all
were
gone
the
bonfire
was
expiring
and
its
last
wreath
of
smoke
curling
up
in
the
moonshine
the
distant
fires
that
had
blazed
along
the
mountains
and
in
the
vega
were
all
extinguished
and
everything
seemed
to
have
sunk
to
repose
sanchica
called
her
parents
and
some
of
her
companions
by
name
but
received
no
reply
she
ran
down
the
side
of
the
mountain
and
by
the
gardens
of
the
generalife
until
she
arrived
in
the
alley
of
trees
leading
to
the
alhambra
when
she
seated
herself
on
a
bench
of
a
woody
recess
to
recover
breath
the
bell
from
the
of
the
alhambra
tolled
midnight
there
was
a
deep
tranquillity
as
if
all
nature
slept
excepting
the
low
tinkling
sound
of
an
unseen
stream
that
ran
under
the
covert
of
the
bushes
the
breathing
sweetness
of
the
atmosphere
was
lulling
her
to
sleep
when
her
eye
was
caught
by
something
glittering
at
a
distance
and
to
her
surprise
she
beheld
a
long
cavalcade
of
moorish
warriors
pouring
down
the
and
along
the
leafy
avenues
some
were
armed
with
lances
and
shields
others
with
cimeters
and
and
with
polished
cuirasses
that
flashed
in
the
moonbeams
their
horses
pranced
proudly
and
champed
upon
their
bits
but
their
tramp
caused
no
more
sound
than
if
they
had
been
shod
with
felt
and
the
riders
were
all
as
pale
as
death
among
them
rode
a
beautiful
lady
with
a
crowned
head
and
long
golden
locks
entwined
with
pearls
the
housings
of
her
palfrey
were
of
crimson
velvet
embroidered
with
gold
and
swept
the
earth
but
she
rode
all
disconsolate
with
eyes
ever
fixed
upon
the
ground
then
succeeded
a
train
of
courtiers
magnificently
arrayed
in
robes
and
turbans
of
divers
colors
and
amidst
them
on
a
charger
rode
king
boabdil
el
chico
in
a
royal
mantle
covered
with
jewels
and
a
crown
sparkling
with
diamonds
the
little
sanchica
knew
him
by
his
yellow
beard
and
his
resemblance
to
his
portrait
which
she
had
often
seen
in
the
of
the
generalife
she
gazed
in
wonder
and
admiration
at
this
royal
pageant
as
it
passed
glistening
among
the
trees
but
though
she
knew
these
monarchs
and
courtiers
and
warriors
so
pale
and
silent
were
out
of
the
common
course
of
nature
and
things
of
magic
and
enchantment
yet
she
looked
on
with
a
bold
heart
such
courage
did
she
derive
from
the
mystic
talisman
of
the
hand
which
was
suspended
about
her
neck
the
cavalcade
having
passed
by
she
rose
and
followed
it
continued
on
to
the
great
gate
of
justice
which
stood
wide
open
the
old
invalid
sentinels
on
duty
lay
on
the
stone
benches
of
the
barbican
buried
in
profound
and
apparently
charmed
sleep
and
the
phantom
pageant
swept
noiselessly
by
them
with
flaunting
banner
and
triumphant
state
sanchica
would
have
followed
but
to
her
surprise
she
beheld
an
opening
in
the
earth
within
the
barbican
leading
down
beneath
the
foundations
of
the
tower
she
entered
for
a
little
distance
and
was
encouraged
to
proceed
by
finding
steps
rudely
hewn
in
the
rock
and
a
vaulted
passage
here
and
there
lit
up
by
a
silver
lamp
which
while
it
gave
light
diffused
likewise
a
grateful
fragrance
venturing
on
she
came
at
last
to
a
great
hall
wrought
out
of
the
heart
of
the
mountain
magnificently
furnished
in
the
moorish
style
and
lighted
up
by
silver
and
crystal
lamps
here
on
an
ottoman
sat
an
old
man
in
moorish
dress
with
a
long
white
beard
nodding
and
dozing
with
a
staff
in
his
hand
which
seemed
ever
to
be
slipping
from
his
grasp
while
at
a
little
distance
sat
a
beautiful
lady
in
ancient
spanish
dress
with
a
coronet
all
sparkling
with
diamonds
and
her
hair
entwined
with
pearls
who
was
softly
playing
on
a
silver
lyre
the
little
sanchica
now
recollected
a
story
she
had
heard
among
the
old
people
of
the
alhambra
concerning
a
gothic
princess
confined
in
the
centre
of
the
mountain
by
an
old
arabian
magician
whom
she
kept
bound
up
in
magic
sleep
by
the
power
of
music
the
lady
paused
with
surprise
at
seeing
a
mortal
in
that
enchanted
hall
is
it
the
eve
of
the
blessed
john
said
she
it
is
replied
sanchica
then
for
one
night
the
magic
charm
is
suspended
come
hither
child
and
fear
not
i
am
a
christian
like
thyself
though
bound
here
by
enchantment
touch
my
fetters
with
the
talisman
that
hangs
about
thy
neck
and
for
this
night
i
shall
be
so
saying
she
opened
her
robes
and
displayed
a
broad
golden
band
round
her
waist
and
a
golden
chain
that
fastened
her
to
the
ground
the
child
hesitated
not
to
apply
the
little
hand
of
jet
to
the
golden
band
and
immediately
the
chain
fell
to
the
earth
at
the
sound
the
old
man
woke
and
began
to
rub
his
eyes
but
the
lady
ran
her
fingers
over
the
chords
of
the
lyre
and
again
he
fell
into
a
slumber
and
began
to
nod
and
his
staff
to
falter
in
his
hand
now
said
the
lady
touch
his
staff
with
the
talismanic
hand
of
the
child
did
so
and
it
fell
from
his
grasp
and
he
sank
in
a
deep
sleep
on
the
ottoman
the
lady
gently
laid
the
silver
lyre
on
the
ottoman
leaning
it
against
the
head
of
the
sleeping
magician
then
touching
the
chords
until
they
vibrated
in
his
ear
o
potent
spirit
of
harmony
said
she
continue
thus
to
hold
his
senses
in
thraldom
till
the
return
of
day
now
follow
me
my
child
continued
she
and
thou
shalt
behold
the
alhambra
as
it
was
in
the
days
of
its
glory
for
thou
hast
a
magic
talisman
that
reveals
all
sanchica
followed
the
lady
in
silence
they
passed
up
through
the
entrance
of
the
cavern
into
the
barbican
of
the
gate
of
justice
and
thence
to
the
plaza
de
los
algibes
or
esplanade
within
the
fortress
this
was
all
filled
with
moorish
soldiery
horse
and
foot
marshalled
in
squadrons
with
banners
displayed
there
were
royal
guards
also
at
the
portal
and
rows
of
african
blacks
with
drawn
cimeters
no
one
spoke
a
word
and
sanchica
passed
on
fearlessly
after
her
conductor
her
astonishment
increased
on
entering
the
royal
palace
in
which
she
had
been
reared
the
broad
moonshine
lit
up
all
the
halls
and
courts
and
gardens
almost
as
brightly
as
if
it
were
day
but
revealed
a
far
different
scene
from
that
to
which
she
was
accustomed
the
walls
of
the
apartments
were
no
longer
stained
and
rent
by
time
instead
of
cobwebs
they
were
now
hung
with
rich
silks
of
damascus
and
the
gildings
and
arabesque
paintings
were
restored
to
their
original
brilliancy
and
freshness
the
halls
no
longer
naked
and
unfurnished
were
set
out
with
divans
and
ottomans
of
the
rarest
stuffs
embroidered
with
pearls
and
studded
with
precious
gems
and
all
the
fountains
in
the
courts
and
gardens
were
playing
the
kitchens
were
again
in
full
operation
cooks
were
busy
preparing
shadowy
dishes
and
roasting
and
boiling
the
phantoms
of
pullets
and
partridges
servants
were
hurrying
to
and
fro
with
silver
dishes
heaped
up
with
dainties
and
arranging
a
delicious
banquet
the
court
of
lions
was
thronged
with
guards
and
courtiers
and
alfaquis
as
in
the
old
times
of
the
moors
and
at
the
upper
end
in
the
saloon
of
judgment
sat
boabdil
on
his
throne
surrounded
by
his
court
and
swaying
a
shadowy
sceptre
for
the
night
notwithstanding
all
this
throng
and
seeming
bustle
not
a
voice
nor
a
footstep
was
to
be
heard
nothing
interrupted
the
midnight
silence
but
the
splashing
of
the
fountains
the
little
sanchica
followed
her
conductress
in
mute
amazement
about
the
palace
until
they
came
to
a
portal
opening
to
the
vaulted
passages
beneath
the
great
tower
of
comares
on
each
side
of
the
portal
sat
the
figure
of
a
nymph
wrought
out
of
alabaster
their
heads
were
turned
aside
and
their
regards
fixed
upon
the
same
spot
within
the
vault
the
enchanted
lady
paused
and
beckoned
the
child
to
her
here
said
she
is
a
great
secret
which
i
will
reveal
to
thee
in
reward
for
thy
faith
and
courage
these
discreet
statues
watch
over
a
treasure
hidden
in
old
times
by
a
moorish
king
tell
thy
father
to
search
the
spot
on
which
their
eyes
are
fixed
and
he
will
find
what
will
make
him
richer
than
any
man
in
granada
thy
innocent
hands
alone
however
gifted
as
thou
art
also
with
the
talisman
can
remove
the
treasure
bid
thy
father
use
it
discreetly
and
devote
a
part
of
it
to
the
performance
of
daily
masses
for
my
deliverance
from
this
unholy
when
the
lady
had
spoken
these
words
she
led
the
child
onward
to
the
little
garden
of
lindaraxa
which
is
hard
by
the
vault
of
the
statues
the
moon
trembled
upon
the
waters
of
the
solitary
fountain
in
the
centre
of
the
garden
and
shed
a
tender
light
upon
the
orange
and
citron
trees
the
beautiful
lady
plucked
a
branch
of
myrtle
and
wreathed
it
round
the
head
of
the
child
let
this
be
a
memento
said
she
of
what
i
have
revealed
to
thee
and
a
testimonial
of
its
truth
my
hour
is
come
i
must
return
to
the
enchanted
hall
follow
me
not
lest
evil
befall
thee
farewell
remember
what
i
have
said
and
have
masses
performed
for
my
so
saying
the
lady
entered
a
dark
passage
leading
beneath
the
tower
of
comares
and
was
no
longer
seen
the
faint
crowing
of
a
cock
was
now
heard
from
the
cottages
below
the
alhambra
in
the
valley
of
the
darro
and
a
pale
streak
of
light
began
to
appear
above
the
eastern
mountains
a
slight
wind
arose
there
was
a
sound
like
the
rustling
of
dry
leaves
through
the
courts
and
corridors
and
door
after
door
shut
to
with
a
jarring
sound
sanchica
returned
to
the
scenes
she
had
so
lately
beheld
thronged
with
the
shadowy
multitude
but
boabdil
and
his
phantom
court
were
gone
the
moon
shone
into
empty
halls
and
galleries
stripped
of
their
transient
splendor
stained
and
dilapidated
by
time
and
hung
with
cobwebs
the
bat
flitted
about
in
the
uncertain
light
and
the
frog
croaked
from
the
fishpond
sanchica
now
made
the
best
of
her
way
to
a
remote
staircase
that
led
up
to
the
humble
apartment
occupied
by
her
family
the
door
as
usual
was
open
for
lope
sanchez
was
too
poor
to
need
bolt
or
bar
she
crept
quietly
to
her
pallet
and
putting
the
myrtle
wreath
beneath
her
pillow
soon
fell
asleep
in
the
morning
she
related
all
that
had
befallen
her
to
her
father
lope
sanchez
however
treated
the
whole
as
a
mere
dream
and
laughed
at
the
child
for
her
credulity
he
went
forth
to
his
customary
labors
in
the
garden
but
had
not
been
there
long
when
his
little
daughter
came
running
to
him
almost
breathless
father
father
cried
she
behold
the
myrtle
wreath
which
the
moorish
lady
bound
round
my
lope
sanchez
gazed
with
astonishment
for
the
stalk
of
the
myrtle
was
of
pure
gold
and
every
leaf
was
a
sparkling
emerald
being
not
much
accustomed
to
precious
stones
he
was
ignorant
of
the
real
value
of
the
wreath
but
he
saw
enough
to
convince
him
that
it
was
something
more
substantial
than
the
stuff
of
which
dreams
are
generally
made
and
that
at
any
rate
the
child
had
dreamt
to
some
purpose
his
first
care
was
to
enjoin
the
most
absolute
secrecy
upon
his
daughter
in
this
respect
however
he
was
secure
for
she
had
discretion
far
beyond
her
years
or
sex
he
then
repaired
to
the
vault
where
stood
the
statues
of
the
two
alabaster
nymphs
he
remarked
that
their
heads
were
turned
from
the
portal
and
that
the
regards
of
each
were
fixed
upon
the
same
point
in
the
interior
of
the
building
lope
sanchez
could
not
but
admire
this
most
discreet
contrivance
for
guarding
a
secret
he
drew
a
line
from
the
eyes
of
the
statues
to
the
point
of
regard
made
a
private
mark
on
the
wall
and
then
retired
all
day
however
the
mind
of
lope
sanchez
was
distracted
with
a
thousand
cares
he
could
not
help
hovering
within
distant
view
of
the
two
statues
and
became
nervous
from
the
dread
that
the
golden
secret
might
be
discovered
every
footstep
that
approached
the
place
made
him
tremble
he
would
have
given
anything
could
he
but
have
turned
the
heads
of
the
statues
forgetting
that
they
had
looked
precisely
in
the
same
direction
for
some
hundreds
of
years
without
any
person
being
the
wiser
a
plague
upon
them
he
would
say
to
himself
they
ll
betray
all
did
ever
mortal
hear
of
such
a
mode
of
guarding
a
secret
then
on
hearing
any
one
advance
he
would
steal
off
as
though
his
very
lurking
near
the
place
would
awaken
suspicion
then
he
would
return
cautiously
and
peep
from
a
distance
to
see
if
everything
was
secure
but
the
sight
of
the
statues
would
again
call
forth
his
indignation
ay
there
they
stand
would
he
say
always
looking
and
looking
and
looking
just
where
they
should
not
confound
them
they
are
just
like
all
their
sex
if
they
have
not
tongues
to
tattle
with
they
ll
be
sure
to
do
it
with
their
at
length
to
his
relief
the
long
anxious
day
drew
to
a
close
the
sound
of
footsteps
was
no
longer
heard
in
the
echoing
halls
of
the
alhambra
the
last
stranger
passed
the
threshold
the
great
portal
was
barred
and
bolted
and
the
bat
and
the
frog
and
the
hooting
owl
gradually
resumed
their
nightly
vocations
in
the
deserted
palace
lope
sanchez
waited
however
until
the
night
was
far
advanced
before
he
ventured
with
his
little
daughter
to
the
hall
of
the
two
nymphs
he
found
them
looking
as
knowingly
and
mysteriously
as
ever
at
the
secret
place
of
deposit
by
your
leaves
gentle
ladies
thought
lope
sanchez
as
he
passed
between
them
i
will
relieve
you
from
this
charge
that
must
have
set
so
heavy
in
your
minds
for
the
last
two
or
three
he
accordingly
went
to
work
at
the
part
of
the
wall
which
he
had
marked
and
in
a
little
while
laid
open
a
concealed
recess
in
which
stood
two
great
jars
of
porcelain
he
attempted
to
draw
them
forth
but
they
were
immovable
until
touched
by
the
innocent
hand
of
his
little
daughter
with
her
aid
he
dislodged
them
from
their
niche
and
found
to
his
great
joy
that
they
were
filled
with
pieces
of
moorish
gold
mingled
with
jewels
and
precious
stones
before
daylight
he
managed
to
convey
them
to
his
chamber
and
left
the
two
guardian
statues
with
their
eyes
still
fixed
on
the
vacant
wall
lope
sanchez
had
thus
on
a
sudden
become
a
rich
man
but
riches
as
usual
brought
a
world
of
cares
to
which
he
had
hitherto
been
a
stranger
how
was
he
to
convey
away
his
wealth
with
safety
how
was
he
even
to
enter
upon
the
enjoyment
of
it
without
awakening
suspicion
now
too
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
dread
of
robbers
entered
into
his
mind
he
looked
with
terror
at
the
insecurity
of
his
habitation
and
went
to
work
to
barricade
the
doors
and
windows
yet
after
all
his
precautions
he
could
not
sleep
soundly
his
usual
gayety
was
at
an
end
he
had
no
longer
a
joke
or
a
song
for
his
neighbors
and
in
short
became
the
most
miserable
animal
in
the
alhambra
his
old
comrades
remarked
this
alteration
pitied
him
heartily
and
began
to
desert
him
thinking
he
must
be
falling
into
want
and
in
danger
of
looking
to
them
for
assistance
little
did
they
suspect
that
his
only
calamity
was
riches
the
wife
of
lope
sanchez
shared
his
anxiety
but
then
she
had
ghostly
comfort
we
ought
before
this
to
have
mentioned
that
lope
being
rather
a
light
inconsiderate
little
man
his
wife
was
accustomed
in
all
grave
matters
to
seek
the
counsel
and
ministry
of
her
confessor
fray
simon
a
sturdy
friar
of
the
neighboring
convent
of
san
francisco
who
was
in
fact
the
spiritual
comforter
of
half
the
good
wives
of
the
neighborhood
he
was
moreover
in
great
esteem
among
divers
sisterhoods
of
nuns
who
requited
him
for
his
ghostly
services
by
frequent
presents
of
those
little
dainties
and
manufactured
in
convents
such
as
delicate
confections
sweet
biscuits
and
bottles
of
spiced
cordials
found
to
be
marvellous
restoratives
after
fasts
and
vigils
fray
simon
thrived
in
the
exercise
of
his
functions
his
oily
skin
glistened
in
the
sunshine
as
he
toiled
up
the
hill
of
the
alhambra
on
a
sultry
day
yet
notwithstanding
his
sleek
condition
the
knotted
rope
round
his
waist
showed
the
austerity
of
his
the
multitude
doffed
their
caps
to
him
as
a
mirror
of
piety
and
even
the
dogs
scented
the
odor
of
sanctity
that
exhaled
from
his
garments
and
howled
from
their
kennels
as
he
passed
such
was
fray
simon
the
spiritual
counsellor
of
the
comely
wife
of
lope
sanchez
and
as
the
father
confessor
is
the
domestic
confidant
of
women
in
humble
life
in
spain
he
was
soon
acquainted
in
great
secrecy
with
the
story
of
the
hidden
treasure
the
friar
opened
his
eyes
and
mouth
and
crossed
himself
a
dozen
times
at
the
news
after
a
moment
s
pause
daughter
of
my
soul
said
he
know
that
thy
husband
has
committed
a
double
sin
a
sin
against
both
state
and
church
the
treasure
he
hath
thus
seized
upon
for
himself
being
found
in
the
royal
domains
belongs
of
course
to
the
crown
but
being
infidel
wealth
rescued
as
it
were
from
the
very
fangs
of
satan
should
be
devoted
to
the
church
still
however
the
matter
may
be
accommodated
bring
hither
thy
myrtle
when
the
good
father
beheld
it
his
eyes
twinkled
more
than
ever
with
admiration
of
the
size
and
beauty
of
the
emeralds
this
said
he
being
the
of
this
discovery
should
be
dedicated
to
pious
purposes
i
will
hang
it
up
as
a
votive
offering
before
the
image
of
san
francisco
in
our
chapel
and
will
earnestly
pray
to
him
this
very
night
that
your
husband
be
permitted
to
remain
in
quiet
possession
of
your
the
good
dame
was
delighted
to
make
her
peace
with
heaven
at
so
cheap
a
rate
and
the
friar
putting
the
wreath
under
his
mantle
departed
with
saintly
steps
toward
his
convent
when
lope
sanchez
came
home
his
wife
told
him
what
had
passed
he
was
excessively
provoked
for
he
lacked
his
wife
s
devotion
and
had
for
some
time
groaned
in
secret
at
the
domestic
visitations
of
the
friar
woman
said
he
what
hast
thou
done
thou
hast
put
everything
at
hazard
by
thy
what
cried
the
good
woman
would
you
forbid
my
disburdening
my
conscience
to
my
confessor
no
wife
confess
as
many
of
your
own
sins
as
you
please
but
as
to
this
it
is
a
sin
of
my
own
and
my
conscience
is
very
easy
under
the
weight
of
there
was
no
use
however
in
complaining
the
secret
was
told
and
like
water
spilled
on
the
sand
was
not
again
to
be
gathered
their
only
chance
was
that
the
friar
would
be
discreet
the
next
day
while
lope
sanchez
was
abroad
there
was
an
humble
knocking
at
the
door
and
fray
simon
entered
with
meek
and
demure
countenance
daughter
said
he
i
have
earnestly
prayed
to
san
francisco
and
he
has
heard
my
prayer
in
the
dead
of
the
night
the
saint
appeared
to
me
in
a
dream
but
with
a
frowning
aspect
why
said
he
dost
thou
pray
to
me
to
dispense
with
this
treasure
of
the
gentiles
when
thou
seest
the
poverty
of
my
chapel
go
to
the
house
of
lope
sanchez
crave
in
my
name
a
portion
of
the
moorish
gold
to
furnish
two
candlesticks
for
the
main
altar
and
let
him
possess
the
residue
in
when
the
good
woman
heard
of
this
vision
she
crossed
herself
with
awe
and
going
to
the
secret
place
where
lope
had
hid
the
treasure
she
filled
a
great
leathern
purse
with
pieces
of
moorish
gold
and
gave
it
to
the
friar
the
pious
monk
bestowed
upon
her
in
return
benedictions
enough
if
paid
by
heaven
to
enrich
her
race
to
the
latest
posterity
then
slipping
the
purse
into
the
sleeve
of
his
habit
he
folded
his
hands
upon
his
breast
and
departed
with
an
air
of
humble
thankfulness
when
lope
sanchez
heard
of
this
second
donation
to
the
church
he
had
wellnigh
lost
his
senses
unfortunate
man
cried
he
what
will
become
of
me
i
shall
be
robbed
by
piecemeal
i
shall
be
ruined
and
brought
to
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
his
wife
could
pacify
him
by
reminding
him
of
the
countless
wealth
that
yet
remained
and
how
considerate
it
was
for
san
francisco
to
rest
contented
with
so
small
a
portion
unluckily
fray
simon
had
a
number
of
poor
relations
to
be
provided
for
not
to
mention
some
sturdy
orphan
children
and
destitute
foundlings
that
he
had
taken
under
his
care
he
repeated
his
visits
therefore
from
day
to
day
with
solicitations
on
behalf
of
saint
dominick
saint
andrew
saint
james
until
poor
lope
was
driven
to
despair
and
found
that
unless
he
got
out
of
the
reach
of
this
holy
friar
he
should
have
to
make
to
every
saint
in
the
calendar
he
determined
therefore
to
pack
up
his
remaining
wealth
beat
a
secret
retreat
in
the
night
and
make
off
to
another
part
of
the
kingdom
full
of
his
project
he
bought
a
stout
mule
for
the
purpose
and
tethered
it
in
a
gloomy
vault
underneath
the
tower
of
the
seven
floors
the
very
place
whence
the
belludo
or
goblin
horse
is
said
to
issue
forth
at
midnight
and
scour
the
streets
of
granada
pursued
by
a
pack
of
lope
sanchez
had
little
faith
in
the
story
but
availed
himself
of
the
dread
occasioned
by
it
knowing
that
no
one
would
be
likely
to
pry
into
the
subterranean
stable
of
the
phantom
steed
he
sent
off
his
family
in
the
course
of
the
day
with
orders
to
wait
for
him
at
a
distant
village
of
the
vega
as
the
night
advanced
he
conveyed
his
treasure
to
the
vault
under
the
tower
and
having
loaded
his
mule
he
led
it
forth
and
cautiously
descended
the
dusky
avenue
honest
lope
had
taken
his
measures
with
the
utmost
secrecy
imparting
them
to
no
one
but
the
faithful
wife
of
his
bosom
by
some
miraculous
revelation
however
they
became
known
to
fray
simon
the
zealous
friar
beheld
these
infidel
treasures
on
the
point
of
slipping
forever
out
of
his
grasp
and
determined
to
have
one
more
dash
at
them
for
the
benefit
of
the
church
and
san
francisco
accordingly
when
the
bells
had
rung
for
animas
and
all
the
alhambra
was
quiet
he
stole
out
of
his
convent
and
descending
through
the
gate
of
justice
concealed
himself
among
the
thickets
of
roses
and
laurels
that
border
the
great
avenue
here
he
remained
counting
the
quarters
of
hours
as
they
were
sounded
on
the
bell
of
the
watchtower
and
listening
to
the
dreary
hootings
of
owls
and
the
distant
barking
of
dogs
from
the
gypsy
caverns
at
length
he
heard
the
tramp
of
hoofs
and
through
the
gloom
of
the
overshading
trees
imperfectly
beheld
a
steed
descending
the
avenue
the
sturdy
friar
chuckled
at
the
idea
of
the
knowing
turn
he
was
about
to
serve
honest
lope
tucking
up
the
skirts
of
his
habit
and
wriggling
like
a
cat
watching
a
mouse
he
waited
until
his
prey
was
directly
before
him
when
darting
forth
from
his
leafy
covert
and
putting
one
hand
on
the
shoulder
and
the
other
on
the
crupper
he
made
a
vault
that
would
not
have
disgraced
the
most
experienced
master
of
equitation
and
alighted
astride
the
steed
ah
ha
said
the
sturdy
friar
we
shall
now
see
who
best
understands
the
he
had
scarce
uttered
the
words
when
the
mule
began
to
kick
and
rear
and
plunge
and
then
set
off
full
speed
down
the
hill
the
friar
attempted
to
check
him
but
in
vain
he
bounded
from
rock
to
rock
and
bush
to
bush
the
friar
s
habit
was
torn
to
ribbons
and
fluttered
in
the
wind
his
shaven
poll
received
many
a
hard
knock
from
the
branches
of
the
trees
and
many
a
scratch
from
the
brambles
to
add
to
his
terror
and
distress
he
found
a
pack
of
seven
hounds
in
full
cry
at
his
heels
and
perceived
too
late
that
he
was
actually
mounted
upon
the
terrible
belludo
away
then
they
went
according
to
the
ancient
phrase
pull
devil
pull
friar
down
the
great
avenue
across
the
plaza
nueva
along
the
zacatin
around
the
vivarrambla
never
did
huntsman
and
hound
make
a
more
furious
run
or
more
infernal
uproar
in
vain
did
the
friar
invoke
every
saint
in
the
calendar
and
the
holy
virgin
into
the
bargain
every
time
he
mentioned
a
name
of
the
kind
it
was
like
a
fresh
application
of
the
spur
and
made
the
belludo
bound
as
high
as
a
house
through
the
remainder
of
the
night
was
the
unlucky
fray
simon
carried
hither
and
thither
and
whither
he
would
not
until
every
bone
in
his
body
ached
and
he
suffered
a
loss
of
leather
too
grievous
to
be
mentioned
at
length
the
crowing
of
a
cock
gave
the
signal
of
returning
day
at
the
sound
the
goblin
steed
wheeled
about
and
galloped
back
for
his
tower
again
he
scoured
the
vivarrambla
the
zacatin
the
plaza
nueva
and
the
avenue
of
fountains
the
seven
dogs
yelling
and
barking
and
leaping
up
and
snapping
at
the
heels
of
the
terrified
friar
the
first
streak
of
day
had
just
appeared
as
they
reached
the
tower
here
the
goblin
steed
kicked
up
his
heels
sent
the
friar
a
summerset
through
the
air
plunged
into
the
dark
vault
followed
by
the
infernal
pack
and
a
profound
silence
succeeded
to
the
late
deafening
clamor
was
ever
so
diabolical
a
trick
played
off
upon
a
holy
friar
a
peasant
going
to
his
labors
at
early
dawn
found
the
unfortunate
fray
simon
lying
under
a
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
but
so
bruised
and
bedevilled
that
he
could
neither
speak
nor
move
he
was
conveyed
with
all
care
and
tenderness
to
his
cell
and
the
story
went
that
he
had
been
waylaid
and
maltreated
by
robbers
a
day
or
two
elapsed
before
he
recovered
the
use
of
his
limbs
he
consoled
himself
in
the
mean
time
with
the
thoughts
that
though
the
mule
with
the
treasure
had
escaped
him
he
had
previously
had
some
rare
pickings
at
the
infidel
spoils
his
first
care
on
being
able
to
use
his
limbs
was
to
search
beneath
his
pallet
where
he
had
secreted
the
myrtle
wreath
and
the
leathern
pouches
of
gold
extracted
from
the
piety
of
dame
sanchez
what
was
his
dismay
at
finding
the
wreath
in
effect
but
a
withered
branch
of
myrtle
and
the
leathern
pouches
filled
with
sand
and
gravel
fray
simon
with
all
his
chagrin
had
the
discretion
to
hold
his
tongue
for
to
betray
the
secret
might
draw
on
him
the
ridicule
of
the
public
and
the
punishment
of
his
superior
it
was
not
until
many
years
afterwards
on
his
that
he
revealed
to
his
confessor
his
nocturnal
ride
on
the
belludo
nothing
was
heard
of
lope
sanchez
for
a
long
time
after
his
disappearance
from
the
alhambra
his
memory
was
always
cherished
as
that
of
a
merry
companion
though
it
was
feared
from
the
care
and
melancholy
observed
in
his
conduct
shortly
before
his
mysterious
departure
that
poverty
and
distress
had
driven
him
to
some
extremity
some
years
afterwards
one
of
his
old
companions
an
invalid
soldier
being
at
malaga
was
knocked
down
and
nearly
run
over
by
a
coach
and
six
the
carriage
stopped
an
old
gentleman
magnificently
dressed
with
a
and
sword
stepped
out
to
assist
the
poor
invalid
what
was
the
astonishment
of
the
latter
to
behold
in
this
grand
cavalier
his
old
friend
lope
sanchez
who
was
actually
celebrating
the
marriage
of
his
daughter
sanchica
with
one
of
the
first
grandees
in
the
land
the
carriage
contained
the
bridal
party
there
was
dame
sanchez
now
grown
as
round
as
a
barrel
and
dressed
out
with
feathers
and
jewels
and
necklaces
of
pearls
and
necklaces
of
diamonds
and
rings
on
every
finger
altogether
a
finery
of
apparel
that
had
not
been
seen
since
the
days
of
queen
sheba
the
little
sanchica
had
now
grown
to
be
a
woman
and
for
grace
and
beauty
might
have
been
mistaken
for
a
duchess
if
not
a
princess
outright
the
bridegroom
sat
beside
her
rather
a
withered
little
man
but
this
only
proved
him
to
be
of
the
blood
a
legitimate
spanish
grandee
being
rarely
above
three
cubits
in
stature
the
match
had
been
of
the
mother
s
making
riches
had
not
spoiled
the
heart
of
honest
lope
he
kept
his
old
comrade
with
him
for
several
days
feasted
him
like
a
king
took
him
to
plays
and
and
at
length
sent
him
away
rejoicing
with
a
big
bag
of
money
for
himself
and
another
to
be
distributed
among
his
ancient
messmates
of
the
alhambra
lope
always
gave
out
that
a
rich
brother
had
died
in
america
and
left
him
heir
to
a
copper
mine
but
the
shrewd
gossips
of
the
alhambra
insist
that
his
wealth
was
all
derived
from
his
having
discovered
the
secret
guarded
by
the
two
marble
nymphs
of
the
alhambra
it
is
remarked
that
these
very
discreet
statues
continue
even
unto
the
present
day
with
their
eyes
fixed
most
significantly
on
the
same
part
of
the
wall
which
leads
many
to
suppose
there
is
still
some
hidden
treasure
remaining
there
well
worthy
the
attention
of
the
enterprising
traveller
though
others
and
particularly
all
female
visitors
regard
them
with
great
complacency
as
lasting
monuments
of
the
fact
that
women
can
keep
a
secret
the
crusade
of
the
grand
master
of
alcántara
in
the
course
of
a
morning
s
research
among
the
old
chronicles
in
the
library
of
the
university
i
came
upon
a
little
episode
in
the
history
of
granada
so
strongly
characteristic
of
the
bigot
zeal
which
sometimes
inflamed
the
christian
enterprises
against
this
splendid
but
devoted
city
that
i
was
tempted
to
draw
it
forth
from
the
volume
in
which
it
lay
entombed
and
submit
it
to
the
reader
in
the
year
of
redemption
there
was
a
valiant
and
devout
grand
master
of
alcántara
named
martin
yañez
de
barbudo
who
was
inflamed
with
a
vehement
desire
to
serve
god
and
fight
the
moors
unfortunately
for
this
brave
and
pious
cavalier
a
profound
peace
existed
between
the
christian
and
moslem
powers
henry
iii
had
just
ascended
the
throne
of
castile
and
yusef
ben
mohammed
had
succeeded
to
the
throne
of
granada
and
both
were
disposed
to
continue
the
peace
which
had
prevailed
between
their
fathers
the
grand
master
looked
with
repining
at
moorish
banners
and
weapons
which
decorated
his
trophies
of
the
exploits
of
his
predecessors
and
repined
at
his
fate
to
exist
in
a
period
of
such
inglorious
tranquillity
at
length
his
impatience
broke
through
all
bounds
and
seeing
that
he
could
find
no
public
war
in
which
to
engage
he
resolved
to
carve
out
a
little
war
for
himself
such
at
least
is
the
account
given
by
some
ancient
chronicles
though
others
give
the
following
as
the
motive
for
this
sudden
resolution
to
go
campaigning
as
the
grand
master
was
one
day
seated
at
table
with
several
of
his
cavaliers
a
man
suddenly
entered
the
hall
tall
meagre
and
bony
with
haggard
countenance
and
fiery
eye
all
recognized
him
for
a
hermit
who
had
been
a
soldier
in
his
youth
but
now
led
a
life
of
penitence
in
a
cave
he
advanced
to
the
table
and
struck
upon
it
with
a
fist
that
seemed
of
iron
cavaliers
said
he
why
sit
ye
here
idly
with
your
weapons
resting
against
the
wall
while
the
enemies
of
the
faith
lord
it
over
the
fairest
portion
of
the
land
holy
father
what
wouldst
thou
have
us
do
asked
the
grand
master
seeing
the
wars
are
over
and
our
swords
bound
up
by
treaties
of
peace
listen
to
my
words
replied
the
hermit
as
i
was
seated
late
at
night
at
the
entrance
of
my
cave
contemplating
the
heavens
i
fell
into
a
reverie
and
a
wonderful
vision
was
presented
to
me
i
beheld
the
moon
a
mere
crescent
yet
luminous
as
the
brightest
silver
and
it
hung
in
the
heavens
over
the
kingdom
of
granada
while
i
was
looking
at
it
behold
there
shot
forth
from
the
firmament
a
blazing
star
which
as
it
went
drew
after
it
all
the
stars
of
heaven
and
they
assailed
the
moon
and
drove
it
from
the
skies
and
the
whole
firmament
was
filled
with
the
glory
of
that
blazing
star
while
mine
eyes
were
yet
dazzled
by
this
wondrous
sight
some
one
stood
by
me
with
snowy
wings
and
a
shining
countenance
oh
man
of
prayer
said
he
get
thee
to
the
grand
master
of
alcántara
and
tell
him
of
the
vision
thou
hast
beheld
he
is
the
blazing
star
destined
to
drive
the
crescent
the
moslem
emblem
from
the
land
let
him
boldly
draw
the
sword
and
continue
the
good
work
begun
by
pelazo
of
old
and
victory
will
assuredly
attend
his
the
grand
master
listened
to
the
hermit
as
to
a
messenger
from
heaven
and
followed
his
counsel
in
all
things
by
his
advice
he
dispatched
two
of
his
stoutest
warriors
armed
on
an
embassy
to
the
moorish
king
they
entered
the
gates
of
granada
without
molestation
as
the
nations
were
at
peace
and
made
their
way
to
the
alhambra
where
they
were
promptly
admitted
to
the
king
who
received
them
in
the
hall
of
ambassadors
they
delivered
their
message
roundly
and
hardly
we
come
o
king
from
don
martin
tañez
de
barbudo
grand
master
of
alcántara
who
affirms
the
faith
of
jesus
christ
to
be
true
and
holy
and
that
of
mahomet
false
and
detestable
and
he
challenges
thee
to
maintain
the
contrary
hand
to
hand
in
single
combat
shouldst
thou
refuse
he
offers
to
combat
with
one
hundred
cavaliers
against
two
hundred
or
in
like
proportion
to
the
number
of
one
thousand
always
allowing
thy
faith
a
double
number
of
champions
remember
o
king
that
thou
canst
not
refuse
this
challenge
since
thy
prophet
knowing
the
impossibility
of
maintaining
his
doctrines
by
argument
has
commanded
his
followers
to
enforce
them
with
the
the
beard
of
king
yusef
trembled
with
indignation
the
master
of
alcántara
said
he
is
a
madman
to
send
such
a
message
and
ye
are
saucy
knaves
to
bring
so
saying
he
ordered
the
ambassadors
to
be
thrown
into
a
dungeon
by
way
of
giving
them
a
lesson
in
diplomacy
and
they
were
roughly
treated
on
their
way
thither
by
the
populace
who
were
exasperated
at
this
insult
to
their
sovereign
and
their
faith
the
grand
master
of
alcántara
could
scarcely
credit
the
tidings
of
the
maltreatment
of
his
messengers
but
the
hermit
rejoiced
when
they
were
repeated
to
him
god
said
he
has
blinded
this
infidel
king
for
his
downfall
since
he
has
sent
no
reply
to
thy
defiance
consider
it
accepted
marshal
thy
forces
therefore
march
forward
to
granada
pause
not
until
thou
seest
the
gate
of
elvira
a
miracle
will
be
wrought
in
thy
favor
there
will
be
a
great
battle
the
enemy
will
be
overthrown
but
not
one
of
thy
soldiers
will
be
the
grand
master
called
upon
every
warrior
zealous
in
the
christian
cause
to
aid
him
in
this
crusade
in
a
little
while
three
hundred
horsemen
and
a
thousand
rallied
under
his
standard
the
horsemen
were
veterans
seasoned
to
battle
and
but
the
infantry
were
raw
and
undisciplined
the
victory
however
was
to
be
miraculous
the
grand
master
was
a
man
of
surpassing
faith
and
knew
that
the
weaker
the
means
the
greater
the
miracle
he
sallied
forth
confidently
therefore
with
his
little
army
and
the
hermit
strode
ahead
bearing
a
cross
on
the
end
of
a
long
pole
and
beneath
it
the
pennon
of
the
order
of
alcántara
as
they
approached
the
city
of
cordova
they
were
overtaken
by
messengers
spurring
in
all
haste
bearing
missives
from
the
castilian
monarch
forbidding
the
enterprise
the
grand
master
was
a
man
of
a
single
mind
and
a
single
will
in
other
words
a
man
of
one
idea
were
i
on
any
other
errand
said
he
i
should
obey
these
letters
as
coming
from
my
lord
the
king
but
i
am
sent
by
a
higher
power
than
the
king
in
compliance
with
its
commands
i
have
advanced
the
cross
thus
far
against
the
infidels
and
it
would
be
treason
to
the
standard
of
christ
to
turn
back
without
achieving
my
so
the
trumpets
were
sounded
the
cross
was
again
reared
aloft
and
the
band
of
zealots
resumed
their
march
as
they
passed
through
the
streets
of
cordova
the
people
were
amazed
at
beholding
a
hermit
bearing
a
cross
at
the
head
of
a
warlike
multitude
but
when
they
learnt
that
a
miraculous
victory
was
to
be
effected
and
granada
destroyed
laborers
and
artisans
threw
by
the
implements
of
their
handicrafts
and
joined
in
the
crusade
while
a
mercenary
rabble
followed
on
with
a
view
of
plunder
a
number
of
cavaliers
of
rank
who
lacked
faith
in
the
promised
miracle
and
dreaded
the
consequences
of
this
unprovoked
irruption
into
the
country
of
the
moor
assembled
at
the
bridge
of
the
guadalquivir
and
endeavored
to
dissuade
the
grand
master
from
crossing
he
was
deaf
to
prayers
expostulations
or
menaces
his
followers
were
enraged
at
this
opposition
to
the
cause
of
the
faith
they
put
an
end
to
the
parley
by
their
clamors
the
cross
was
again
reared
and
borne
triumphantly
across
the
bridge
the
multitude
increased
as
it
proceeded
by
the
time
the
grand
master
had
reached
alcala
la
real
which
stands
on
a
mountain
overlooking
the
vega
of
granada
upwards
of
five
thousand
men
on
foot
had
joined
his
standard
at
alcala
came
forth
alonzo
fernandez
de
cordova
lord
of
aguilar
his
brother
diego
fernandez
marshal
of
castile
and
other
cavaliers
of
valor
and
experience
placing
themselves
in
the
way
of
the
grand
master
what
madness
is
this
don
martin
said
they
the
moorish
king
has
two
hundred
thousand
and
five
thousand
horse
within
his
walls
what
can
you
and
your
handful
of
cavaliers
and
your
noisy
rabble
do
against
such
force
bethink
you
of
the
disasters
which
have
befallen
other
christian
commanders
who
have
crossed
these
rocky
borders
with
ten
times
your
force
think
too
of
the
mischief
that
will
be
brought
upon
this
kingdom
by
an
outrage
of
the
kind
committed
by
a
man
of
your
rank
and
importance
a
grand
master
of
alcántara
pause
we
entreat
you
while
the
truce
is
yet
unbroken
await
within
the
borders
the
reply
of
the
king
of
granada
to
your
challenge
if
he
agree
to
meet
you
singly
or
with
champions
two
or
three
it
will
be
your
individual
contest
and
fight
it
out
in
god
s
name
if
he
refuse
you
may
return
home
with
great
honor
and
the
disgrace
will
fall
upon
the
several
cavaliers
who
had
hitherto
followed
the
grand
master
with
devoted
zeal
were
moved
by
these
expostulations
and
suggested
to
him
the
policy
of
listening
to
this
advice
cavaliers
said
he
addressing
himself
to
alonzo
fernandez
de
cordova
and
his
companions
i
thank
you
for
the
counsel
you
have
so
kindly
bestowed
upon
me
and
if
i
were
merely
in
pursuit
of
individual
glory
i
might
be
swayed
by
it
but
i
am
engaged
to
achieve
a
great
triumph
of
the
faith
which
god
is
to
effect
by
miracle
through
my
means
as
to
you
cavaliers
turning
to
those
of
his
followers
who
had
wavered
if
your
hearts
fail
you
or
you
repent
of
having
put
your
hands
to
this
good
work
return
in
god
s
name
and
my
blessing
go
with
you
for
myself
though
i
have
none
to
stand
by
me
but
this
holy
hermit
yet
will
i
assuredly
proceed
until
i
have
planted
this
sacred
standard
on
the
walls
of
granada
or
perished
in
the
don
martin
yañez
de
barbudo
replied
the
cavaliers
we
are
not
men
to
turn
our
backs
upon
our
commander
however
rash
his
enterprise
we
spoke
but
in
caution
lead
on
therefore
and
if
it
be
to
the
death
be
assured
to
the
death
we
will
follow
by
this
time
the
common
soldiers
became
impatient
forward
forward
shouted
they
forward
in
the
cause
of
so
the
grand
master
gave
signal
the
hermit
again
reared
the
cross
aloft
and
they
poured
down
a
defile
of
the
mountain
with
solemn
chants
of
triumph
that
night
they
encamped
at
the
river
of
azores
and
the
next
morning
which
was
sunday
crossed
the
borders
their
first
pause
was
at
an
atalaya
or
solitary
tower
built
upon
a
rock
a
frontier
post
to
keep
a
watch
upon
the
border
and
give
notice
of
invasion
it
was
thence
called
el
torre
del
exea
the
tower
of
the
spy
the
grand
master
halted
before
it
and
summoned
its
petty
garrison
to
surrender
he
was
answered
by
a
shower
of
stones
and
arrows
which
wounded
him
in
the
hand
and
killed
three
of
his
men
how
is
this
father
said
he
to
the
hermit
you
assured
me
that
not
one
of
my
followers
would
be
slain
true
my
son
but
i
meant
in
the
great
battle
of
the
infidel
king
what
need
is
there
of
miracle
to
aid
in
the
capture
of
a
petty
tower
the
grand
master
was
satisfied
he
ordered
wood
to
be
piled
against
the
door
of
the
tower
to
burn
it
down
in
the
mean
time
provisions
were
unloaded
from
the
and
the
crusaders
withdrawing
beyond
sat
down
on
the
grass
to
a
repast
to
strengthen
them
for
the
arduous
day
s
work
before
them
while
thus
engaged
they
were
startled
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
great
moorish
host
the
atalayas
had
given
the
alarm
by
fire
and
smoke
from
the
of
an
enemy
across
the
border
and
the
king
of
granada
had
sallied
forth
with
a
great
force
to
the
encounter
the
crusaders
nearly
taken
by
surprise
flew
to
arms
and
prepared
for
battle
the
grand
master
ordered
his
three
hundred
horsemen
to
dismount
and
fight
on
foot
in
support
of
the
infantry
the
moors
however
charged
so
suddenly
that
they
separated
the
cavaliers
from
the
and
prevented
their
uniting
the
grand
master
gave
the
old
santiago
santiago
and
close
spain
he
and
his
knights
breasted
the
fury
of
the
battle
but
were
surrounded
by
a
countless
host
and
assailed
with
arrows
stones
darts
and
arquebuses
still
they
fought
fearlessly
and
made
prodigious
slaughter
the
hermit
mingled
in
the
hottest
of
the
fight
in
one
hand
he
bore
the
cross
in
the
other
he
brandished
a
sword
with
which
he
dealt
about
him
like
a
maniac
slaying
several
of
the
enemy
until
he
sank
to
the
ground
covered
with
wounds
the
grand
master
saw
him
fall
and
saw
too
late
the
fallacy
of
his
prophecies
despair
however
only
made
him
fight
the
more
fiercely
until
he
also
fell
overpowered
by
numbers
his
devoted
cavaliers
emulated
his
holy
zeal
not
one
turned
his
back
nor
asked
for
mercy
all
fought
until
they
fell
as
to
the
many
were
killed
many
taken
prisoners
the
residue
escaped
to
alcala
la
real
when
the
moors
came
to
strip
the
slain
the
wounds
of
the
cavaliers
were
all
found
to
be
in
front
such
was
the
catastrophe
of
this
fanatic
enterprise
the
moors
vaunted
it
as
a
decisive
proof
of
the
superior
sanctity
of
their
faith
and
extolled
their
king
to
the
skies
when
he
returned
in
triumph
to
granada
as
it
was
satisfactorily
shown
that
this
crusade
was
the
enterprise
of
an
individual
and
contrary
to
the
express
orders
of
the
king
of
castile
the
peace
of
the
two
kingdoms
was
not
interrupted
nay
the
moors
evinced
a
feeling
of
respect
for
the
valor
of
the
unfortunate
grand
master
and
readily
gave
up
his
body
to
don
alonzo
fernandez
de
cordova
who
came
from
alcala
to
seek
it
the
christians
of
the
frontier
united
in
paying
the
last
sad
honors
to
his
memory
his
body
was
placed
upon
a
bier
covered
with
the
pennon
of
the
order
of
alcántara
and
the
broken
cross
the
emblem
of
his
confident
hopes
and
fatal
disappointment
was
borne
before
it
in
this
way
his
remains
were
carried
back
in
funeral
procession
through
the
mountain
tract
which
he
had
traversed
so
resolutely
wherever
it
passed
through
a
town
or
village
the
populace
followed
with
tears
and
lamentations
bewailing
him
as
a
valiant
knight
and
a
martyr
to
the
faith
his
body
was
interred
in
the
chapel
of
the
convent
of
santa
maria
de
almocovara
and
on
his
sepulchre
may
still
be
seen
engraven
in
quaint
and
antique
spanish
the
following
testimonial
to
his
bravery

lies

i
made
frequent
descents
into
the
jesuit
s
library
of
the
university
and
relished
more
and
more
the
old
spanish
chronicles
which
i
found
there
bound
in
parchment
i
delight
in
those
quaint
histories
which
treat
of
the
times
when
the
moslems
maintained
a
foothold
in
the
peninsula
with
all
their
bigotry
and
occasional
intolerance
they
are
full
of
noble
acts
and
generous
sentiments
and
have
a
high
spicy
oriental
flavor
not
to
be
found
in
other
records
of
the
times
which
were
merely
european
in
fact
spain
even
at
the
present
day
is
a
country
apart
severed
in
history
habits
manners
and
modes
of
thinking
from
all
the
rest
of
europe
it
is
a
romantic
country
but
its
romance
has
none
of
the
sentimentality
of
modern
european
romance
it
is
chiefly
derived
from
the
brilliant
regions
of
the
east
and
from
the
school
of
saracenic
chivalry
the
arab
invasion
and
conquest
brought
a
higher
civilization
and
a
nobler
style
of
thinking
into
gothic
spain
the
arabs
were
a
sagacious
and
poetical
people
and
were
imbued
with
oriental
science
and
literature
wherever
they
established
a
seat
of
power
it
became
a
for
the
learned
and
ingenious
and
they
softened
and
refined
the
people
whom
they
conquered
by
degrees
occupancy
seemed
to
give
them
an
hereditary
right
to
their
foothold
in
the
land
they
ceased
to
be
looked
upon
as
invaders
and
were
regarded
as
rival
neighbors
the
peninsula
broken
up
into
a
variety
of
states
both
christian
and
moslem
became
for
centuries
a
great
where
the
art
of
war
seemed
to
be
the
principal
business
of
man
and
was
carried
to
the
highest
pitch
of
romantic
chivalry
the
original
ground
of
hostility
a
difference
of
faith
gradually
lost
its
rancor
neighboring
states
of
opposite
creeds
were
occasionally
linked
together
in
alliances
offensive
and
defensive
so
that
the
cross
and
crescent
were
to
be
seen
side
by
side
fighting
against
some
common
enemy
in
times
of
peace
too
the
noble
youth
of
either
faith
resorted
to
the
same
cities
christian
or
moslem
to
school
themselves
in
military
science
even
in
the
temporary
truces
of
sanguinary
wars
the
warriors
who
had
recently
striven
together
in
the
deadly
conflicts
of
the
field
laid
aside
their
animosity
met
at
tournaments
jousts
and
other
military
festivities
and
exchanged
the
courtesies
of
gentle
and
generous
spirits
thus
the
opposite
races
became
frequently
mingled
together
in
peaceful
intercourse
or
if
any
rivalry
took
place
it
was
in
those
high
courtesies
and
nobler
acts
which
bespeak
the
accomplished
cavalier
warriors
of
opposite
creeds
became
ambitious
of
transcending
each
other
in
magnanimity
as
well
as
valor
indeed
the
chivalric
virtues
were
refined
upon
to
a
degree
sometimes
fastidious
and
constrained
but
at
other
times
inexpressibly
noble
and
affecting
the
annals
of
the
times
teem
with
illustrious
instances
of
courtesy
romantic
generosity
lofty
disinterestedness
and
punctilious
honor
that
warm
the
very
soul
to
read
them
these
have
furnished
themes
for
national
plays
and
poems
or
have
been
celebrated
in
those
ballads
which
are
as
the
of
the
people
and
thus
have
continued
to
exercise
an
influence
on
the
national
character
which
centuries
of
vicissitude
and
decline
have
not
been
able
to
destroy
so
that
with
all
their
faults
and
they
are
many
the
spaniards
even
at
the
present
day
are
on
many
points
the
most
and
people
of
europe
it
is
true
the
romance
of
feeling
derived
from
the
sources
i
have
mentioned
has
like
all
other
romance
its
affectations
and
extremes
it
renders
the
spaniard
at
times
pompous
and
grandiloquent
prone
to
carry
the
pundonor
or
point
of
honor
beyond
the
bounds
of
sober
sense
and
sound
morality
disposed
in
the
midst
of
poverty
to
affect
the
grande
caballero
and
to
look
down
with
sovereign
disdain
upon
arts
mechanical
and
all
the
gainful
pursuits
of
plebeian
life
but
this
very
inflation
of
spirit
while
it
fills
his
brain
with
vapors
lifts
him
above
a
thousand
meannesses
and
though
it
often
keeps
him
in
indigence
ever
protects
him
from
vulgarity
in
the
present
day
when
popular
literature
is
running
into
the
low
levels
of
life
and
luxuriating
on
the
vices
and
follies
of
mankind
and
when
the
universal
pursuit
of
gain
is
trampling
down
the
early
growth
of
poetic
feeling
and
wearing
out
the
verdure
of
the
soul
i
question
whether
it
would
not
be
of
service
for
the
reader
occasionally
to
turn
to
these
records
of
prouder
times
and
loftier
modes
of
thinking
and
to
steep
himself
to
the
very
lips
in
old
spanish
romance
with
these
preliminary
suggestions
the
fruit
of
a
morning
s
reading
and
rumination
in
the
old
jesuit
s
library
of
the
university
i
will
give
him
a
legend
in
point
drawn
forth
from
one
of
the
venerable
chronicles
alluded
to
legend
of
don
munio
sancho
de
hinojosa
in
the
cloisters
of
the
ancient
benedictine
convent
of
san
domingo
at
silos
in
castile
are
the
mouldering
yet
magnificent
monuments
of
the
once
powerful
and
chivalrous
family
of
hinojosa
among
these
reclines
the
marble
figure
of
a
knight
in
complete
armor
with
the
hands
pressed
together
as
if
in
prayer
on
one
side
of
his
tomb
is
sculptured
in
relief
a
band
of
christian
cavaliers
capturing
a
cavalcade
of
male
and
female
moors
on
the
other
side
the
same
cavaliers
are
represented
kneeling
before
an
altar
the
tomb
like
most
of
the
neighboring
monuments
is
almost
in
ruins
and
the
sculpture
is
nearly
unintelligible
excepting
to
the
keen
eye
of
the
antiquary
the
story
connected
with
the
sepulchre
however
is
still
preserved
in
the
old
spanish
chronicles
and
is
to
the
following
purport
in
old
times
several
hundred
years
ago
there
was
a
noble
castilian
cavalier
named
don
munio
sancho
de
hinojosa
lord
of
a
border
castle
which
had
stood
the
brunt
of
many
a
moorish
foray
he
had
seventy
horsemen
as
his
household
troops
all
of
the
ancient
castilian
proof
stark
warriors
hard
riders
and
men
of
iron
with
these
he
scoured
the
moorish
lands
and
made
his
name
terrible
throughout
the
borders
his
was
covered
with
banners
cimeters
and
moslem
helms
the
trophies
of
his
prowess
don
munio
was
moreover
a
keen
huntsman
and
rejoiced
in
hounds
of
all
kinds
steeds
for
the
chase
and
hawks
for
the
towering
sport
of
falconry
when
not
engaged
in
warfare
his
delight
was
to
beat
up
the
neighboring
forests
and
scarcely
ever
did
he
ride
forth
without
hound
and
horn
a
in
his
hand
or
a
hawk
upon
his
fist
and
an
attendant
train
of
huntsmen
his
wife
doña
maria
palacin
was
of
a
gentle
and
timid
nature
little
fitted
to
be
the
spouse
of
so
hardy
and
adventurous
a
knight
and
many
a
tear
did
the
poor
lady
shed
when
he
sallied
forth
upon
his
daring
enterprises
and
many
a
prayer
did
she
offer
up
for
his
safety
as
this
doughty
cavalier
was
one
day
hunting
he
stationed
himself
in
a
thicket
on
the
borders
of
a
green
glade
of
the
forest
and
dispersed
his
followers
to
rouse
the
game
and
drive
it
toward
his
stand
he
had
not
been
here
long
when
a
cavalcade
of
moors
of
both
sexes
came
prankling
over
the
they
were
unarmed
and
magnificently
dressed
in
robes
of
tissue
and
embroidery
rich
shawls
of
india
bracelets
and
anklets
of
gold
and
jewels
that
sparkled
in
the
sun
at
the
head
of
this
gay
cavalcade
rode
a
youthful
cavalier
superior
to
the
rest
in
dignity
and
loftiness
of
demeanor
and
in
splendor
of
attire
beside
him
was
a
damsel
whose
veil
blown
aside
by
the
breeze
displayed
a
face
of
surpassing
beauty
and
eyes
cast
down
in
maiden
modesty
yet
beaming
with
tenderness
and
joy
don
munio
thanked
his
stars
for
sending
him
such
a
prize
and
exulted
at
the
thought
of
bearing
home
to
his
wife
the
glittering
spoils
of
these
infidels
putting
his
to
his
lips
he
gave
a
blast
that
rung
through
the
forest
his
huntsmen
came
running
from
all
quarters
and
the
astonished
moors
were
surrounded
and
made
captives
the
beautiful
moor
wrung
her
hands
in
despair
and
her
female
attendants
uttered
the
most
piercing
cries
the
young
moorish
cavalier
alone
retained
he
inquired
the
name
of
the
christian
knight
who
commanded
this
troop
of
horsemen
when
told
that
it
was
don
munio
sancho
de
hinojosa
his
countenance
lighted
up
approaching
that
cavalier
and
kissing
his
hand
don
munio
sancho
said
he
i
have
heard
of
your
fame
as
a
true
and
valiant
knight
terrible
in
arms
but
schooled
in
the
noble
virtues
of
chivalry
such
do
i
trust
to
find
you
in
me
you
behold
abadil
son
of
a
moorish
alcayde
i
am
on
the
way
to
celebrate
my
nuptials
with
this
lady
chance
has
thrown
us
in
your
power
but
i
confide
in
your
magnanimity
take
all
our
treasure
and
jewels
demand
what
ransom
you
think
proper
for
our
persons
but
suffer
us
not
to
be
insulted
nor
when
the
good
knight
heard
this
appeal
and
beheld
the
beauty
of
the
youthful
pair
his
heart
was
touched
with
tenderness
and
courtesy
god
forbid
said
he
that
i
should
disturb
such
happy
nuptials
my
prisoners
in
troth
shall
ye
be
for
fifteen
days
and
immured
within
my
castle
where
i
claim
as
conqueror
the
right
of
celebrating
your
so
saying
he
dispatched
one
of
his
fleetest
horsemen
in
advance
to
notify
doña
maria
palacin
of
the
coming
of
this
bridal
party
while
he
and
his
huntsmen
escorted
the
cavalcade
not
as
captors
but
as
a
guard
of
honor
as
they
drew
near
to
the
castle
the
banners
were
hung
out
and
the
trumpets
sounded
from
the
battlements
and
on
their
nearer
approach
the
drawbridge
was
lowered
and
doña
maria
came
forth
to
meet
them
attended
by
her
ladies
and
knights
her
pages
and
her
minstrels
she
took
the
young
bride
allifra
in
her
arms
kissed
her
with
the
tenderness
of
a
sister
and
conducted
her
into
the
castle
in
the
mean
time
don
munio
sent
forth
missives
in
every
direction
and
had
viands
and
dainties
of
all
kinds
collected
from
the
country
round
and
the
wedding
of
the
moorish
lovers
was
celebrated
with
all
possible
state
and
festivity
for
fifteen
days
the
castle
was
given
up
to
joy
and
revelry
there
were
tiltings
and
jousts
at
the
ring
and
and
banquets
and
dances
to
the
sound
of
minstrelsy
when
the
fifteen
days
were
at
an
end
he
made
the
bride
and
bridegroom
magnificent
presents
and
conducted
them
and
their
attendants
safely
beyond
the
borders
such
in
old
times
were
the
courtesy
and
generosity
of
a
spanish
cavalier
several
years
after
this
event
the
king
of
castile
summoned
his
nobles
to
assist
him
in
a
campaign
against
the
moors
don
munio
sancho
was
among
the
first
to
answer
to
the
call
with
seventy
horsemen
all
stanch
and
warriors
his
wife
doña
maria
hung
about
his
neck
alas
my
lord
exclaimed
she
how
often
wilt
thou
tempt
thy
fate
and
when
will
thy
thirst
for
glory
be
appeased
one
battle
more
replied
don
munio
one
battle
more
for
the
honor
of
castile
and
i
here
make
a
vow
that
when
this
is
over
i
will
lay
by
my
sword
and
repair
with
my
cavaliers
in
pilgrimage
to
the
sepulchre
of
our
lord
at
the
cavaliers
all
joined
with
him
in
the
vow
and
doña
maria
felt
in
some
degree
soothed
in
spirit
still
she
saw
with
a
heavy
heart
the
departure
of
her
husband
and
watched
his
banner
with
wistful
eyes
until
it
disappeared
among
the
trees
of
the
forest
the
king
of
castile
led
his
army
to
the
plains
of
salmanara
where
they
encountered
the
moorish
host
near
to
ucles
the
battle
was
long
and
bloody
the
christians
repeatedly
wavered
and
were
as
often
rallied
by
the
energy
of
their
commanders
don
munio
was
covered
with
wounds
but
refused
to
leave
the
field
the
christians
at
length
gave
way
and
the
king
was
hardly
pressed
and
in
danger
of
being
captured
don
munio
called
upon
his
cavaliers
to
follow
him
to
the
rescue
now
is
the
time
cried
he
to
prove
your
loyalty
fall
to
like
brave
men
we
fight
for
the
true
faith
and
if
we
lose
our
lives
here
we
gain
a
better
life
rushing
with
his
men
between
the
king
and
his
pursuers
they
checked
the
latter
in
their
career
and
gave
time
for
their
monarch
to
escape
but
they
fell
victims
to
their
loyalty
they
all
fought
to
the
last
gasp
don
munio
was
singled
out
by
a
powerful
moorish
knight
but
having
been
wounded
in
the
right
arm
he
fought
to
disadvantage
and
was
slain
the
battle
being
over
the
moor
paused
to
possess
himself
of
the
spoils
of
this
redoubtable
christian
warrior
when
he
unlaced
the
helmet
however
and
beheld
the
countenance
of
don
munio
he
gave
a
great
cry
and
smote
his
breast
woe
is
me
cried
he
i
have
slain
my
benefactor
the
flower
of
knightly
virtue
the
most
magnanimous
of
cavaliers
while
the
battle
had
been
raging
on
the
plain
of
salmanara
doña
maria
palacin
remained
in
her
castle
a
prey
to
the
keenest
anxiety
her
eyes
were
ever
fixed
on
the
road
that
led
from
the
country
of
the
moors
and
often
she
asked
the
watchman
of
the
tower
what
seest
thou
one
evening
at
the
shadowy
hour
of
twilight
the
warden
sounded
his
horn
i
see
cried
he
a
numerous
train
winding
up
the
valley
there
are
mingled
moors
and
christians
the
banner
of
my
lord
is
in
the
advance
joyful
tidings
exclaimed
the
old
seneschal
my
lord
returns
in
triumph
and
brings
captives
then
the
castle
courts
rang
with
shouts
of
joy
and
the
standard
was
displayed
and
the
trumpets
were
sounded
and
the
drawbridge
was
lowered
and
doña
maria
went
forth
with
her
ladies
and
her
knights
and
her
pages
and
her
minstrels
to
welcome
her
lord
from
the
wars
but
as
the
train
drew
nigh
she
beheld
a
sumptuous
bier
covered
with
black
velvet
and
on
it
lay
a
warrior
as
if
taking
his
repose
he
lay
in
his
armor
with
his
helmet
on
his
head
and
his
sword
in
his
hand
as
one
who
had
never
been
conquered
and
around
the
bier
were
the
escutcheons
of
the
house
of
hinojosa
a
number
of
moorish
cavaliers
attended
the
bier
with
emblems
of
mourning
and
with
dejected
countenances
and
their
leader
cast
himself
at
the
feet
of
doña
maria
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
she
beheld
in
him
the
gallant
abadil
whom
she
had
once
welcomed
with
his
bride
to
her
castle
but
who
now
came
with
the
body
of
her
lord
whom
he
had
unknowingly
slain
in
battle
the
sepulchre
erected
in
the
cloisters
of
the
convent
of
san
domingo
was
achieved
at
the
expense
of
the
moor
abadil
as
a
feeble
testimony
of
his
grief
for
the
death
of
the
good
knight
don
munio
and
his
reverence
for
his
memory
the
tender
and
faithful
doña
maria
soon
followed
her
lord
to
the
tomb
on
one
of
the
stones
of
a
small
arch
beside
his
sepulchre
is
the
following
simple
inscription
jacet
maria
palacin
uxor
munonis
sancij
de
here
lies
maria
palacin
wife
of
munio
sancho
de
hinojosa
the
legend
of
don
munio
sancho
does
not
conclude
with
his
death
on
the
same
day
on
which
the
battle
took
place
on
the
plain
of
salmanara
a
chaplain
of
the
holy
temple
at
jerusalem
while
standing
at
the
outer
gate
beheld
a
train
of
christian
cavaliers
advancing
as
if
in
pilgrimage
the
chaplain
was
a
native
of
spain
and
as
the
pilgrims
approached
he
knew
the
foremost
to
be
don
munio
sancho
de
hinojosa
with
whom
he
had
been
well
acquainted
in
former
times
hastening
to
the
patriarch
he
told
him
of
the
honorable
rank
of
the
pilgrims
at
the
gate
the
patriarch
therefore
went
forth
with
a
grand
procession
of
priests
and
monks
and
received
the
pilgrims
with
all
due
honor
there
were
seventy
cavaliers
beside
their
leader
all
stark
and
lofty
warriors
they
carried
their
helmets
in
their
hands
and
their
faces
were
deadly
pale
they
greeted
no
one
nor
looked
either
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
but
entered
the
chapel
and
kneeling
before
the
sepulchre
of
our
saviour
performed
their
orisons
in
silence
when
they
had
concluded
they
rose
as
if
to
depart
and
the
patriarch
and
his
attendants
advanced
to
speak
to
them
but
they
were
no
more
to
be
seen
every
one
marvelled
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
this
prodigy
the
patriarch
carefully
noted
down
the
day
and
sent
to
castile
to
learn
tidings
of
don
munio
sancho
de
hinojosa
he
received
for
reply
that
on
the
very
day
specified
that
worthy
knight
with
seventy
of
his
followers
had
been
slain
in
battle
these
therefore
must
have
been
the
blessed
spirits
of
those
christian
warriors
come
to
fulfil
their
vow
of
pilgrimage
to
the
holy
sepulchre
at
jerusalem
such
was
castilian
faith
in
the
olden
time
which
kept
its
word
even
beyond
the
grave
if
any
one
should
doubt
of
the
miraculous
apparition
of
these
phantom
knights
let
him
consult
the
history
of
the
kings
of
castile
and
leon
by
the
learned
and
pious
fray
prudencio
de
sandoval
bishop
of
pamplona
where
he
will
find
it
recorded
in
the
history
of
king
don
alonzo
on
the
hundred
and
second
page
it
is
too
precious
a
legend
to
be
lightly
abandoned
to
the
doubter
poets
and
poetry
of
moslem
andalus
during
the
latter
part
of
my
sojourn
in
the
alhambra
i
was
more
than
once
visited
by
the
moor
of
tetuan
with
whom
i
took
great
pleasure
in
rambling
through
the
halls
and
courts
and
getting
him
to
explain
to
me
the
arabic
inscriptions
he
endeavored
to
do
so
faithfully
but
though
he
succeeded
in
giving
me
the
thought
he
despaired
of
imparting
an
idea
of
the
grace
and
beauty
of
the
language
the
aroma
of
the
poetry
said
he
is
all
lost
in
translation
enough
was
imparted
however
to
increase
the
stock
of
my
delightful
associations
with
this
extraordinary
pile
perhaps
there
never
was
a
monument
more
characteristic
of
an
age
and
people
than
the
alhambra
a
rugged
fortress
without
a
voluptuous
palace
within
war
frowning
from
its
battlements
poetry
breathing
throughout
the
fairy
architecture
of
its
halls
one
is
irresistibly
transported
in
imagination
to
those
times
when
moslem
spain
was
a
region
of
light
amid
christian
yet
benighted
europe
externally
a
warrior
power
fighting
for
existence
internally
a
realm
devoted
to
literature
science
and
the
arts
where
philosophy
was
cultivated
with
passion
though
wrought
up
into
subtleties
and
refinements
and
where
the
luxuries
of
sense
were
transcended
by
those
of
thought
and
imagination
arab
poetry
we
are
told
arrived
at
its
highest
splendor
under
the
ommiades
of
spain
who
for
a
long
time
centred
the
power
and
splendor
of
the
western
caliphat
at
cordova
most
of
the
sovereigns
of
that
brilliant
line
were
themselves
poets
one
of
the
last
of
them
was
mahomed
ben
abderahman
he
led
the
life
of
a
sybarite
in
the
famous
palace
and
gardens
of
azahara
surrounding
himself
with
all
that
could
excite
the
imagination
and
delight
the
senses
his
palace
was
the
resort
of
poets
his
vizier
ibn
zeydun
was
called
the
horace
of
moslem
spain
from
his
exquisite
verses
which
were
recited
with
enthusiasm
even
in
the
saloons
of
the
eastern
caliphs
the
vizier
became
passionately
enamored
of
the
princess
walada
daughter
of
mahomed
she
was
the
idol
of
her
father
s
court
a
poetess
of
the
highest
order
and
renowned
for
beauty
as
well
as
talent
if
ibn
zeydun
was
the
horace
of
moslem
spain
she
was
its
sappho
the
princess
became
the
subject
of
the
vizier
s
most
impassioned
verses
especially
of
a
famous
risáleh
or
epistle
addressed
to
her
which
the
historian
declares
has
never
been
equalled
for
tenderness
and
melancholy
whether
the
poet
was
happy
in
his
love
the
authors
i
have
consulted
do
not
say
but
one
intimates
that
the
princess
was
discreet
as
she
was
beautiful
and
caused
many
a
lover
to
sigh
in
vain
in
fact
the
reign
of
love
and
poetry
in
the
delicious
abode
of
zahara
was
soon
brought
to
a
close
by
a
popular
insurrection
mahomed
with
his
family
took
refuge
in
the
fortress
of
ucles
near
toledo
where
he
was
treacherously
poisoned
by
the
alcayde
and
thus
perished
one
of
the
last
of
the
ommiades
the
downfall
of
that
brilliant
dynasty
which
had
concentrated
everything
at
cordova
was
favorable
to
the
general
literature
of
morisco
spain
after
the
breaking
of
the
necklace
and
the
scattering
of
its
pearls
says
the
kings
of
small
states
divided
among
themselves
the
patrimony
of
the
beni
they
vied
with
each
other
in
filling
their
capitals
with
poets
and
learned
men
and
rewarded
them
with
boundless
prodigality
such
were
the
moorish
kings
of
seville
of
the
illustrious
line
of
the
beni
abbad
with
whom
says
the
same
writer
resided
fruit
and
and
pomegranates
who
became
the
centre
of
eloquence
in
prose
and
verse
every
day
of
whose
reign
was
a
solemn
festivity
whose
history
abounds
in
generous
actions
and
heroic
deeds
that
will
last
through
surrounding
ages
and
live
forever
in
the
memory
of
man
no
place
however
profited
more
in
point
of
civilization
and
refinement
by
the
downfall
of
the
western
caliphat
than
granada
it
succeeded
to
cordova
in
splendor
while
it
surpassed
it
in
romantic
beauty
of
situation
the
amenity
of
its
climate
where
the
ardent
heats
of
a
southern
summer
were
tempered
by
breezes
from
mountains
the
voluptuous
repose
of
its
valleys
and
the
bosky
luxuriance
of
its
groves
and
gardens
all
awakened
sensations
of
delight
and
disposed
the
mind
to
love
and
poetry
hence
the
great
number
of
amatory
poets
that
flourished
in
granada
hence
those
amorous
canticles
breathing
of
love
and
war
and
wreathing
chivalrous
grace
round
the
stern
exercise
of
arms
those
ballads
which
still
form
the
pride
and
delight
of
spanish
literature
are
but
the
echoes
of
amatory
and
chivalric
lays
which
once
delighted
the
moslem
courts
of
andalus
and
in
which
a
modern
historian
of
granada
pretends
to
find
the
origin
of
the
and
the
type
of
the
gay
science
of
the
troubadours
poetry
was
cultivated
in
granada
by
both
sexes
had
allah
says
bestowed
no
other
boon
on
granada
than
that
of
making
it
the
birthplace
of
so
many
poetesses
that
alone
would
be
sufficient
for
its
among
the
most
famous
of
these
was
hafsah
renowned
says
the
old
chronicler
for
beauty
talents
nobility
and
wealth
we
have
a
mere
relic
of
her
poetry
in
some
verses
addressed
to
her
lover
ahmed
recalling
an
evening
passed
together
in
the
garden
of
maumal
allah
has
given
us
a
happy
night
such
as
he
never
vouchsafes
to
the
wicked
and
the
ignoble
we
have
beheld
the
cypresses
of
maumal
gently
bowing
their
heads
before
the
mountain
breeze
the
sweet
perfumed
breeze
that
smelt
of
gillyflowers
the
dove
murmured
her
love
among
the
trees
the
sweet
basil
inclined
its
boughs
to
the
limpid
the
garden
of
maumal
was
famous
among
the
moors
for
its
rivulets
its
fountains
its
flowers
and
above
all
its
cypresses
it
had
its
name
from
a
vizier
of
abdallah
grandson
of
aben
habuz
and
sultan
of
granada
under
the
administration
of
this
vizier
many
of
the
noblest
public
works
were
executed
he
constructed
an
aqueduct
by
which
water
was
brought
from
the
mountains
of
alfacar
to
irrigate
the
hills
and
orchards
north
of
the
city
he
planted
a
public
walk
with
and
made
delicious
gardens
for
the
solace
of
the
melancholy
the
name
of
maumal
says
alcántara
ought
to
be
preserved
in
granada
in
letters
of
perhaps
it
is
as
well
preserved
by
being
associated
with
the
garden
he
planted
and
by
being
mentioned
in
the
verses
of
hafsah
how
often
does
a
casual
word
from
a
poet
confer
immortality
perhaps
the
reader
may
be
curious
to
learn
something
of
the
story
of
hafsah
and
her
lover
thus
connected
with
one
of
the
beautiful
localities
of
granada
the
following
are
all
the
particulars
i
have
been
able
to
rescue
out
of
the
darkness
and
oblivion
which
have
settled
upon
the
brightest
names
and
geniuses
of
moslem
spain
ahmed
and
hafsah
flourished
in
the
sixth
century
of
the
hegira
the
twelfth
of
the
christian
era
ahmed
was
the
son
of
the
alcayde
of
alcala
la
real
his
father
designed
him
for
public
and
military
life
and
would
have
made
him
his
lieutenant
but
the
youth
was
of
a
poetical
temperament
and
preferred
a
life
of
lettered
ease
in
the
delightful
abodes
of
granada
here
he
surrounded
himself
by
objects
of
taste
in
the
arts
and
by
the
works
of
the
learned
he
divided
his
time
between
study
and
social
enjoyment
he
was
fond
of
the
sports
of
the
field
and
kept
horses
hawks
and
hounds
he
devoted
himself
to
literature
became
renowned
for
erudition
and
his
compositions
in
prose
and
verse
were
extolled
for
their
beauty
and
in
the
mouths
of
every
one
of
a
tender
susceptible
heart
and
extremely
sensible
to
female
charms
he
became
the
devoted
lover
of
hafsah
the
passion
was
mutual
and
for
once
the
course
of
true
love
appeared
to
run
smooth
the
lovers
were
both
young
equal
in
merit
fame
rank
and
fortune
enamored
of
each
other
s
genius
as
well
as
person
and
inhabiting
a
region
formed
to
be
a
realm
of
love
and
poetry
a
poetical
intercourse
was
carried
on
between
them
that
formed
the
delight
of
granada
they
were
continually
interchanging
verses
and
epistles
the
poetry
of
which
says
the
arabian
writer
al
makkari
was
like
the
language
of
in
the
height
of
their
happiness
a
change
took
place
in
the
government
of
granada
it
was
the
time
when
the
almohades
a
berber
tribe
of
mount
atlas
had
acquired
the
control
of
moslem
spain
and
removed
the
seat
of
government
from
cordova
to
morocco
the
sultan
abdelmuman
governed
spain
through
his
walis
and
alcaydes
and
his
son
sidi
abu
said
was
made
wali
of
granada
he
governed
in
his
father
s
name
with
royal
state
and
splendor
and
with
despotic
sway
being
a
stranger
in
the
country
and
a
moor
by
birth
he
sought
to
strengthen
himself
by
drawing
round
him
popular
persons
of
the
arab
race
and
to
this
effect
made
ahmed
who
was
then
in
the
zenith
of
his
fame
and
popularity
his
vizier
ahmed
would
have
declined
the
post
but
the
wali
was
peremptory
its
duties
were
irksome
to
him
and
he
spurned
at
its
restraint
on
a
with
some
of
his
gay
companions
he
gave
way
to
his
poetic
vein
exulting
in
his
breaking
away
from
the
thraldom
of
a
despotic
master
like
a
hawk
from
the
jesses
of
the
falconer
to
follow
the
soaring
impulses
of
his
soul
his
words
were
repeated
to
sidi
abu
said
ahmed
said
the
informant
spurns
at
restraint
and
scoffs
at
thy
the
poet
was
instantly
dismissed
from
office
the
loss
of
an
irksome
post
was
no
grievance
to
one
of
his
joyous
temperament
but
he
soon
discovered
the
real
cause
of
his
removal
the
wali
was
his
rival
he
had
seen
and
become
enamored
of
hafsah
what
was
worse
hafsah
was
dazzled
with
the
conquest
she
had
made
for
a
time
ahmed
treated
the
matter
with
ridicule
and
appealed
to
the
prejudice
existing
between
the
arab
and
moorish
races
sidi
abu
said
was
of
a
dark
olive
complexion
how
canst
thou
endure
that
black
man
said
he
scornfully
by
allah
for
twenty
dinars
i
can
buy
thee
a
better
than
he
in
the
the
scoff
reached
the
ears
of
sidi
abu
said
and
rankled
in
his
heart
at
other
times
ahmed
gave
way
to
grief
and
tenderness
recalling
past
scenes
of
happiness
reproaching
hafsah
with
her
inconstancy
and
warning
her
in
despairing
accents
that
she
would
be
the
cause
of
his
death
his
words
were
unheeded
the
idea
of
having
the
son
of
the
sultan
for
a
lover
had
captivated
the
imagination
of
the
poetess
maddened
by
jealousy
and
despair
ahmed
joined
in
a
conspiracy
against
the
ruling
dynasty
it
was
discovered
and
the
conspirators
fled
from
granada
some
escaped
to
a
castle
on
the
mountains
ahmed
took
refuge
in
malaga
where
he
concealed
himself
intending
to
embark
for
valencia
he
was
discovered
loaded
with
chains
and
thrown
into
a
dungeon
to
abide
the
decision
of
sidi
abu
said
he
was
visited
in
prison
by
a
nephew
who
has
left
on
record
an
account
of
the
interview
the
youth
was
moved
to
tears
at
seeing
his
illustrious
relative
late
so
prosperous
and
honored
fettered
like
a
malefactor
why
dost
thou
weep
said
ahmed
are
these
tears
shed
for
me
for
me
who
have
enjoyed
all
that
the
world
could
give
weep
not
for
me
i
have
had
my
share
of
happiness
banqueted
on
the
daintiest
fare
quaffed
out
of
crystal
cups
slept
on
beds
of
down
been
arrayed
in
the
richest
silks
and
brocades
ridden
the
fleetest
steeds
enjoyed
the
loves
of
the
fairest
maidens
weep
not
for
me
my
present
reverse
is
but
the
inevitable
course
of
fate
i
have
committed
acts
which
render
pardon
hopeless
i
must
await
my
his
presentiment
was
correct
the
vengeance
of
sidi
abu
said
was
only
to
be
satisfied
by
the
blood
of
his
rival
and
the
unfortunate
ahmed
was
beheaded
at
malaga
in
the
month
jumadi
in
the
year
of
the
hegira
april
when
the
news
was
brought
to
the
hafsah
she
was
struck
with
sorrow
and
remorse
and
put
on
mourning
recalling
his
warning
words
and
reproaching
herself
with
being
the
cause
of
his
death
of
the
after
fortunes
of
hafsah
i
have
no
further
trace
than
that
she
died
in
morocco
in
outliving
both
her
lovers
for
sidi
abu
said
died
in
morocco
of
the
plague
in
a
memorial
of
his
residence
in
granada
remained
in
a
palace
which
he
built
on
the
banks
of
the
xenil
the
garden
of
maumal
the
scene
of
the
early
lives
of
ahmed
and
hafsah
is
no
longer
in
existence
its
site
may
be
found
by
the
antiquary
in
poetical
research
an
expedition
in
quest
of
a
diploma
one
of
the
most
important
occurrences
in
the
domestic
life
of
the
alhambra
was
the
departure
of
manuel
the
nephew
of
doña
antonia
for
malaga
to
stand
examination
as
a
physician
i
have
already
informed
the
reader
that
on
his
success
in
obtaining
a
degree
depended
in
a
great
measure
the
union
and
future
fortunes
of
himself
and
his
cousin
dolores
at
least
so
i
was
privately
informed
by
mateo
ximenes
and
various
circumstances
concurred
to
corroborate
his
information
their
courtship
however
was
carried
on
very
quietly
and
discreetly
and
i
scarce
think
i
should
have
discovered
it
if
i
had
not
been
put
on
the
alert
by
the
mateo
in
the
present
instance
dolores
was
less
on
the
reserve
and
had
busied
herself
for
several
days
in
fitting
out
honest
manuel
for
his
expedition
all
his
clothes
had
been
arranged
and
packed
in
the
neatest
order
and
above
all
she
had
worked
a
smart
andalusian
for
him
with
her
own
hands
on
the
morning
appointed
for
his
departure
a
stout
mule
on
which
he
was
to
perform
the
journey
was
paraded
at
the
portal
of
the
alhambra
and
tio
polo
uncle

an
old
invalid
soldier
attended
to
caparison
him
this
veteran
was
one
of
the
curiosities
of
the
place
he
had
a
leathern
lantern
visage
tanned
in
the
tropics
a
long
roman
nose
and
a
black
beetle
eye
i
had
frequently
observed
him
reading
apparently
with
intense
interest
an
old
volume
sometimes
he
would
be
surrounded
by
a
group
of
his
brother
invalids
some
seated
on
the
parapets
some
lying
on
the
grass
listening
with
fixed
attention
while
he
read
slowly
and
deliberately
out
of
his
favorite
work
sometimes
pausing
to
explain
or
expound
for
the
benefit
of
his
less
enlightened
auditors
i
took
occasion
one
day
to
inform
myself
of
this
ancient
book
which
appeared
to
be
his
and
found
it
to
be
an
odd
volume
of
the
works
of
padre
benito
geronymo
feyjoo
and
that
one
which
treats
about
the
magic
of
spain
the
mysterious
caves
of
salamanca
and
toledo
the
purgatory
of
san
patricio
patrick
and
other
mystic
subjects
of
the
kind
from
that
time
i
kept
my
eye
upon
the
veteran
on
the
present
occasion
i
amused
myself
with
watching
him
fit
out
the
steed
of
manuel
with
all
the
forecast
of
an
old
campaigner
first
he
took
a
considerable
time
in
adjusting
to
the
back
of
the
mule
a
cumbrous
saddle
of
antique
fashion
high
in
front
and
behind
with
moorish
stirrups
like
shovels
the
whole
looking
like
a
relic
of
the
old
armory
of
the
alhambra
then
a
fleecy
was
accommodated
to
the
deep
seat
of
the
saddle
then
a
maleta
neatly
packed
by
the
hand
of
dolores
was
buckled
behind
then
a
manta
was
thrown
over
it
to
serve
either
as
cloak
or
couch
then
the
alforjas
carefully
stocked
with
provant
were
hung
in
front
together
with
the
bota
or
leathern
bottle
for
either
wine
or
water
and
lastly
the
trabucho
which
the
old
soldier
slung
behind
giving
it
his
benediction
it
was
like
the
fitting
out
in
old
times
of
a
moorish
cavalier
for
a
foray
or
a
joust
in
the
vivarrambla
a
number
of
the
lazzaroni
of
the
fortress
had
gathered
round
with
some
of
the
invalids
all
looking
on
all
offering
their
aid
and
all
giving
advice
to
the
great
annoyance
of
tio
polo
when
all
was
ready
manuel
took
leave
of
the
household
tio
polo
held
his
stirrup
while
he
mounted
adjusted
the
girths
and
saddle
and
cheered
him
off
in
military
style
then
turning
to
dolores
who
stood
admiring
her
cavalier
as
he
trotted
off
ah
dolorocita
exclaimed
he
with
a
nod
and
a
wink
muy
guapo
manuelito
in
su
ah
dolores
manuel
is
mighty
fine
in
his
jacket
the
little
damsel
blushed
and
laughed
and
ran
into
the
house
days
elapsed
without
tidings
from
manuel
though
he
had
promised
to
write
the
heart
of
dolores
began
to
misgive
her
had
anything
happened
to
him
on
the
road
had
he
failed
in
his
examination
a
circumstance
occurred
in
her
little
household
to
add
to
her
uneasiness
and
fill
her
mind
with
foreboding
it
was
almost
equal
to
the
escapado
of
her
pigeon
her
cat
eloped
at
night
and
clambered
to
the
tiled
roof
of
the
alhambra
in
the
dead
of
the
night
there
was
a
fearful
caterwauling
some
grimalkin
was
uncivil
to
her
then
there
was
a
scramble
then
a
then
both
parties
rolled
off
the
roof
and
tumbled
from
a
great
height
among
the
trees
on
the
nothing
more
was
seen
or
heard
of
the
fugitive
and
poor
dolores
considered
it
but
the
prelude
to
greater
calamities
at
the
end
of
ten
days
however
manuel
returned
in
triumph
duly
authorized
to
kill
or
cure
and
all
dolores
cares
were
over
there
was
a
general
gathering
in
the
evening
of
the
humble
friends
and
of
dame
antonio
to
congratulate
her
and
to
pay
their
respects
to
señor
who
peradventure
at
some
future
day
might
have
all
their
lives
in
his
hands
one
of
the
most
important
of
these
guests
was
old
tio
polo
and
i
gladly
seized
the
occasion
to
prosecute
my
acquaintance
with
him
oh
señor
cried
dolores
you
who
are
so
eager
to
learn
all
the
old
histories
of
the
alhambra
tio
polo
knows
more
about
them
than
any
one
else
about
the
place
more
than
mateo
ximenes
and
his
whole
family
put
tio
polo
tell
the
señor
all
those
stories
you
told
us
one
evening
about
enchanted
moors
and
the
haunted
bridge
over
the
darro
and
the
old
stone
pomegranates
that
have
been
there
since
the
days
of
king
chico
it
was
some
time
before
the
old
invalid
could
be
brought
into
a
narrative
vein
he
shook
his
head
they
were
all
idle
tales
not
worthy
of
being
told
to
a
cavallero
like
myself
it
was
only
by
telling
some
stories
of
the
kind
myself
i
at
last
got
him
to
open
his
budget
it
was
a
whimsical
farrago
partly
made
up
of
what
he
had
heard
in
the
alhambra
partly
of
what
he
had
read
in
padre
feyjoo
i
will
endeavor
to
give
the
reader
the
substance
of
it
but
i
will
not
promise
to
give
it
in
the
very
words
of
tio
polo
the
legend
of
the
enchanted
soldier
everybody
has
heard
of
the
cave
of
cyprian
at
salamanca
where
in
old
times
judicial
astronomy
necromancy
chiromancy
and
other
dark
and
damnable
arts
were
secretly
taught
by
an
ancient
sacristan
or
as
some
will
have
it
by
the
devil
himself
in
that
disguise
the
cave
has
long
been
shut
up
and
the
very
site
of
it
forgotten
though
according
to
tradition
the
entrance
was
somewhere
about
where
the
stone
cross
stands
in
the
small
square
of
the
seminary
of
carvajal
and
this
tradition
appears
in
some
degree
corroborated
by
the
circumstances
of
the
following
story
there
was
at
one
time
a
student
of
salamanca
don
vicente
by
name
of
that
merry
but
mendicant
class
who
set
out
on
the
road
to
learning
without
a
penny
in
pouch
for
the
journey
and
who
during
college
vacations
beg
from
town
to
town
and
village
to
village
to
raise
funds
to
enable
them
to
pursue
their
studies
through
the
ensuing
term
he
was
now
about
to
set
forth
on
his
wanderings
and
being
somewhat
musical
slung
on
his
back
a
guitar
with
which
to
amuse
the
villagers
and
pay
for
a
meal
or
a
night
s
lodgings
as
he
passed
by
the
stone
cross
in
the
seminary
square
he
pulled
off
his
hat
and
made
a
short
invocation
to
cyprian
for
good
luck
when
casting
his
eyes
upon
the
earth
he
perceived
something
glitter
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
on
picking
it
up
it
proved
to
be
a
of
mixed
metal
in
which
gold
and
silver
appeared
to
be
blended
the
seal
bore
as
a
device
two
triangles
crossing
each
other
so
as
to
form
a
star
this
device
is
said
to
be
a
cabalistic
sign
invented
by
king
solomon
the
wise
and
of
mighty
power
in
all
cases
of
enchantment
but
the
honest
student
being
neither
sage
nor
conjurer
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
he
took
the
ring
as
a
present
from
cyprian
in
reward
of
his
prayer
slipped
it
on
his
finger
made
a
bow
to
the
cross
and
strumming
his
guitar
set
off
merrily
on
his
wandering
the
life
of
a
mendicant
student
in
spain
is
not
the
most
miserable
in
the
world
especially
if
he
has
any
talent
at
making
himself
agreeable
he
rambles
at
large
from
village
to
village
and
city
to
city
curiosity
or
caprice
may
conduct
him
the
country
curates
who
for
the
most
part
have
been
mendicant
students
in
their
time
give
him
shelter
for
the
night
and
a
comfortable
meal
and
often
enrich
him
with
several
quartos
or
halfpence
in
the
morning
as
he
presents
himself
from
door
to
door
in
the
streets
of
the
cities
he
meets
with
no
harsh
rebuff
no
chilling
contempt
for
there
is
no
disgrace
attending
his
mendicity
many
of
the
most
learned
men
in
spain
having
commenced
their
career
in
this
manner
but
if
like
the
student
in
question
he
is
a
varlet
and
a
merry
companion
and
above
all
if
he
can
play
the
guitar
he
is
sure
of
a
hearty
welcome
among
the
peasants
and
smiles
and
favors
from
their
wives
and
daughters
in
this
way
then
did
our
ragged
and
musical
son
of
learning
make
his
way
over
half
the
kingdom
with
the
fixed
determination
to
visit
the
famous
city
of
granada
before
his
return
sometimes
he
was
gathered
for
the
night
into
the
fold
of
some
village
pastor
sometimes
he
was
sheltered
under
the
humble
but
hospitable
roof
of
the
peasant
seated
at
the
with
his
guitar
he
delighted
the
simple
folk
with
his
ditties
or
striking
up
a
fandango
or
bolero
set
the
brown
country
lads
and
lasses
dancing
in
the
mellow
twilight
in
the
morning
he
departed
with
kind
words
from
host
and
hostess
and
kind
looks
and
peradventure
a
squeeze
of
the
hand
from
the
daughter
at
length
he
arrived
at
the
great
object
of
his
musical
vagabondizing
the
city
of
granada
and
hailed
with
wonder
and
delight
its
moorish
towers
its
lovely
vega
and
its
snowy
mountains
glistening
through
a
summer
atmosphere
it
is
needless
to
say
with
what
eager
curiosity
he
entered
its
gates
and
wandered
through
its
streets
and
gazed
upon
its
oriental
monuments
every
female
face
peering
through
a
window
or
beaming
from
a
balcony
was
to
him
a
zorayda
or
a
zelinda
nor
could
he
meet
a
stately
dame
on
the
alameda
but
he
was
ready
to
fancy
her
a
moorish
princess
and
to
spread
his
student
s
robe
beneath
her
feet
his
musical
talent
his
happy
humor
his
youth
and
his
good
looks
won
him
a
universal
welcome
in
spite
of
his
ragged
robes
and
for
several
days
he
led
a
gay
life
in
the
old
moorish
capital
and
its
environs
one
of
his
occasional
haunts
was
the
fountain
of
avellanos
in
the
valley
of
darro
it
is
one
of
the
popular
resorts
of
granada
and
has
been
so
since
the
days
of
the
moors
and
here
the
student
had
an
opportunity
of
pursuing
his
studies
of
female
beauty
a
branch
of
study
to
which
he
was
a
little
prone
here
he
would
take
his
seat
with
his
guitar
improvise
to
admiring
groups
of
majos
and
majas
or
prompt
with
his
music
the
dance
he
was
thus
engaged
one
evening
when
he
beheld
a
padre
of
the
church
advancing
at
whose
approach
every
one
touched
the
hat
he
was
evidently
a
man
of
consequence
he
certainly
was
a
mirror
of
good
if
not
of
holy
living
robust
and
and
breathing
at
every
pore
with
the
warmth
of
the
weather
and
the
exercise
of
the
walk
as
he
passed
along
he
would
every
now
and
then
draw
a
maravedi
out
of
his
pocket
and
bestow
it
on
a
beggar
with
an
air
of
signal
beneficence
ah
the
blessed
father
would
be
the
cry
long
life
to
him
and
may
he
soon
be
a
bishop
to
aid
his
steps
in
ascending
the
hill
he
leaned
gently
now
and
then
on
the
arm
of
a
handmaid
evidently
the
of
this
kindest
of
pastors
ah
such
a
damsel
andalus
from
head
to
foot
from
the
rose
in
her
hair
to
the
fairy
shoe
and
lacework
stocking
andalus
in
every
movement
in
every
undulation
of
the
body
ripe
melting
andalus
but
then
so
modest
so
shy
ever
with
downcast
eyes
listening
to
the
words
of
the
padre
or
if
by
chance
she
let
flash
a
it
was
suddenly
checked
and
her
eyes
once
more
cast
to
the
ground
the
good
padre
looked
benignantly
on
the
company
about
the
fountain
and
took
his
seat
with
some
emphasis
on
a
stone
bench
while
the
handmaid
hastened
to
bring
him
a
glass
of
sparkling
water
he
sipped
it
deliberately
and
with
a
relish
tempering
it
with
one
of
those
spongy
pieces
of
frosted
eggs
and
sugar
so
dear
to
spanish
epicures
and
on
returning
the
glass
to
the
hand
of
the
damsel
pinched
her
cheek
with
infinite
ah
the
good
pastor
whispered
the
student
to
himself
what
a
happiness
would
it
be
to
be
gathered
into
his
fold
with
such
a
for
a
but
no
such
good
fare
was
likely
to
befall
him
in
vain
he
essayed
those
powers
of
pleasing
which
he
had
found
so
irresistible
with
country
curates
and
country
lasses
never
had
he
touched
his
guitar
with
such
skill
never
had
he
poured
forth
more
ditties
but
he
had
no
longer
a
country
curate
or
country
lass
to
deal
with
the
worthy
priest
evidently
did
not
relish
music
and
the
modest
damsel
never
raised
her
eyes
from
the
ground
they
remained
but
a
short
time
at
the
fountain
the
good
padre
hastened
their
return
to
granada
the
damsel
gave
the
student
one
shy
glance
in
retiring
but
it
plucked
the
heart
out
of
his
bosom
he
inquired
about
them
after
they
had
gone
padre
tomás
was
one
of
the
saints
of
granada
a
model
of
regularity
punctual
in
his
hour
of
rising
his
hour
of
taking
a
paseo
for
an
appetite
his
hours
of
eating
his
hour
of
taking
his
siesta
his
hour
of
playing
his
game
of
tresillo
of
an
evening
with
some
of
the
dames
of
the
cathedral
circle
his
hour
of
supping
and
his
hour
of
retiring
to
rest
to
gather
fresh
strength
for
another
day
s
round
of
similar
duties
he
had
an
easy
sleek
mule
for
his
riding
a
matronly
housekeeper
skilled
in
preparing
for
his
table
and
the
to
smooth
his
pillow
at
night
and
bring
him
his
chocolate
in
the
morning
adieu
now
to
the
gay
thoughtless
life
of
the
student
the
of
a
bright
eye
had
been
the
undoing
of
him
day
and
night
he
could
not
get
the
image
of
this
most
modest
damsel
out
of
his
mind
he
sought
the
mansion
of
the
padre
alas
it
was
above
the
class
of
houses
accessible
to
a
strolling
student
like
himself
the
worthy
padre
had
no
sympathy
with
him
he
had
never
been
obliged
to
sing
for
his
supper
he
blockaded
the
house
by
day
catching
a
glance
of
the
damsel
now
and
then
as
she
appeared
at
a
casement
but
these
glances
only
fed
his
flame
without
encouraging
his
hope
he
serenaded
her
balcony
at
night
and
at
one
time
was
flattered
by
the
appearance
of
something
white
at
a
window
alas
it
was
only
the
of
the
padre
never
was
lover
more
devoted
never
damsel
more
shy
the
poor
student
was
reduced
to
despair
at
length
arrived
the
eve
of
john
when
the
lower
classes
of
granada
swarm
into
the
country
dance
away
the
afternoon
and
pass
midsummer
s
night
on
the
banks
of
the
darro
and
the
xenil
happy
are
they
who
on
this
eventful
night
can
wash
their
faces
in
those
waters
just
as
the
cathedral
bell
tells
midnight
for
at
that
precise
moment
they
have
a
beautifying
power
the
student
having
nothing
to
do
suffered
himself
to
be
carried
away
by
the
throng
until
he
found
himself
in
the
narrow
valley
of
the
darro
below
the
lofty
hill
and
ruddy
towers
of
the
alhambra
the
dry
bed
of
the
river
the
rocks
which
border
it
the
terraced
gardens
which
overhang
it
were
alive
with
variegated
groups
dancing
under
the
vines
and
to
the
sound
of
the
guitar
and
castanets
the
student
remained
for
some
time
in
doleful
dumps
leaning
against
one
of
the
huge
misshapen
stone
pomegranates
which
adorn
the
ends
of
the
little
bridge
over
the
darro
he
cast
a
wistful
glance
upon
the
merry
scene
where
every
cavalier
had
his
dame
or
to
speak
more
appropriately
every
jack
his
jill
sighed
at
his
own
solitary
state
a
victim
to
the
black
eye
of
the
most
unapproachable
of
damsels
and
repined
at
his
ragged
garb
which
seemed
to
shut
the
gate
of
hope
against
him
by
degrees
his
attention
was
attracted
to
a
neighbor
equally
solitary
with
himself
this
was
a
tall
soldier
of
a
stern
aspect
and
grizzled
beard
who
seemed
posted
as
a
sentry
at
the
opposite
pomegranate
his
face
was
bronzed
by
time
he
was
arrayed
in
ancient
spanish
armor
with
buckler
and
lance
and
stood
immovable
as
a
statue
what
surprised
the
student
was
that
though
thus
strangely
equipped
he
was
totally
unnoticed
by
the
passing
throng
albeit
that
many
almost
brushed
against
him
this
is
a
city
of
old
time
peculiarities
thought
the
student
and
doubtless
this
is
one
of
them
with
which
the
inhabitants
are
too
familiar
to
be
his
own
curiosity
however
was
awakened
and
being
of
a
social
disposition
he
accosted
the
soldier
a
rare
old
suit
of
armor
that
which
you
wear
comrade
may
i
ask
what
corps
you
belong
to
the
soldier
gasped
out
a
reply
from
a
pair
of
jaws
which
seemed
to
have
rusted
on
their
hinges
the
royal
guard
of
ferdinand
and
santa
maria
why
it
is
three
centuries
since
that
corps
was
in
and
for
three
centuries
have
i
been
mounting
guard
now
i
trust
my
tour
of
duty
draws
to
a
close
dost
thou
desire
fortune
the
student
held
up
his
tattered
cloak
in
reply
i
understand
thee
if
thou
hast
faith
and
courage
follow
me
and
thy
fortune
is
softly
comrade
to
follow
thee
would
require
small
courage
in
one
who
has
nothing
to
lose
but
life
and
an
old
guitar
neither
of
much
value
but
my
faith
is
of
a
different
matter
and
not
to
be
put
in
temptation
if
it
be
any
criminal
act
by
which
i
am
to
mend
my
fortune
think
not
my
ragged
cloak
will
make
me
undertake
the
soldier
turned
on
him
a
look
of
high
displeasure
my
sword
said
he
has
never
been
drawn
but
in
the
cause
of
the
faith
and
the
throne
i
am
a
trust
in
me
and
fear
no
the
student
followed
him
wondering
he
observed
that
no
one
heeded
their
conversation
and
that
the
soldier
made
his
way
through
the
various
groups
of
idlers
unnoticed
as
if
invisible
crossing
the
bridge
the
soldier
led
the
way
by
a
narrow
and
steep
path
past
a
moorish
mill
and
aqueduct
and
up
the
ravine
which
separates
the
domains
of
the
generalife
from
those
of
the
alhambra
the
last
ray
of
the
sun
shone
upon
the
red
battlements
of
the
latter
which
beetled
far
above
and
the
were
proclaiming
the
festival
of
the
ensuing
day
the
ravine
was
overshadowed
by
vines
and
myrtles
and
the
outer
towers
and
walls
of
the
fortress
it
was
dark
and
lonely
and
the
bats
began
to
flit
about
at
length
the
soldier
halted
at
a
remote
and
ruined
tower
apparently
intended
to
guard
a
moorish
aqueduct
he
struck
the
foundation
with
the
of
his
spear
a
rumbling
sound
was
heard
and
the
solid
stones
yawned
apart
leaving
an
opening
as
wide
as
a
door
enter
in
the
name
of
the
holy
trinity
said
the
soldier
and
fear
the
student
s
heart
quaked
but
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
muttered
his
ave
maria
and
followed
his
mysterious
guide
into
a
deep
vault
cut
out
of
the
solid
rock
under
the
tower
and
covered
with
arabic
inscriptions
the
soldier
pointed
to
a
stone
seat
hewn
along
one
side
of
the
vault
behold
said
he
my
couch
for
three
hundred
the
bewildered
student
tried
to
force
a
joke
by
the
blessed
anthony
said
he
but
you
must
have
slept
soundly
considering
the
hardness
of
your
on
the
contrary
sleep
has
been
a
stranger
to
these
eyes
incessant
watchfulness
has
been
my
doom
listen
to
my
lot
i
was
one
of
the
royal
guards
of
ferdinand
and
isabella
but
was
taken
prisoner
by
the
moors
in
one
of
their
sorties
and
confined
a
captive
in
this
tower
when
preparations
were
made
to
surrender
the
fortress
to
the
christian
sovereigns
i
was
prevailed
upon
by
an
alfaqui
a
moorish
priest
to
aid
him
in
secreting
some
of
the
treasures
of
boabdil
in
this
vault
i
was
justly
punished
for
my
fault
the
alfaqui
was
an
african
necromancer
and
by
his
infernal
arts
cast
a
spell
upon
me
to
guard
his
treasures
something
must
have
happened
to
him
for
he
never
returned
and
here
have
i
remained
ever
since
buried
alive
years
and
years
have
rolled
away
earthquakes
have
shaken
this
hill
i
have
heard
stone
by
stone
of
the
tower
above
tumbling
to
the
ground
in
the
natural
operation
of
time
but
the
walls
of
this
vault
set
both
time
and
earthquakes
at
defiance
once
every
hundred
years
on
the
festival
of
john
the
enchantment
ceases
to
have
thorough
sway
i
am
permitted
to
go
forth
and
post
myself
upon
the
bridge
of
the
darro
where
you
met
me
waiting
until
some
one
shall
arrive
who
may
have
power
to
break
this
magic
spell
i
have
hitherto
mounted
guard
there
in
vain
i
walk
as
in
a
cloud
concealed
from
mortal
sight
you
are
the
first
to
accost
me
for
now
three
hundred
years
i
behold
the
reason
i
see
on
your
finger
the
of
solomon
the
wise
which
is
proof
against
all
enchantment
with
you
it
remains
to
deliver
me
from
this
awful
dungeon
or
to
leave
me
to
keep
guard
here
for
another
hundred
the
student
listened
to
this
tale
in
mute
wonderment
he
had
heard
many
tales
of
treasures
shut
up
under
strong
enchantment
in
the
vaults
of
the
alhambra
but
had
treated
them
as
fables
he
now
felt
the
value
of
the
which
had
in
a
manner
been
given
to
him
by
cyprian
still
though
armed
by
so
potent
a
talisman
it
was
an
awful
thing
to
find
himself
in
such
a
place
with
an
enchanted
soldier
who
according
to
the
laws
of
nature
ought
to
have
been
quietly
in
his
grave
for
nearly
three
centuries
a
personage
of
this
kind
however
was
quite
out
of
the
ordinary
run
and
not
to
be
trifled
with
and
he
assured
him
he
might
rely
upon
his
friendship
and
good
will
to
do
everything
in
his
power
for
his
deliverance
i
trust
to
a
motive
more
powerful
than
friendship
said
the
soldier
he
pointed
to
a
ponderous
iron
coffer
secured
by
locks
inscribed
with
arabic
characters
that
coffer
said
he
contains
countless
treasure
in
gold
and
jewels
and
precious
stones
break
the
magic
spell
by
which
i
am
enthralled
and
one
half
of
this
treasure
shall
be
but
how
am
i
to
do
it
the
aid
of
a
christian
priest
and
a
christian
maid
is
necessary
the
priest
to
exorcise
the
powers
of
darkness
the
damsel
to
touch
this
chest
with
the
seal
of
solomon
this
must
be
done
at
night
but
have
a
care
this
is
solemn
work
and
not
to
be
effected
by
the
the
priest
must
be
a
a
model
of
sanctity
and
must
mortify
the
flesh
before
he
comes
here
by
a
rigorous
fast
of
hours
and
as
to
the
maiden
she
must
be
above
reproach
and
proof
against
temptation
linger
not
in
finding
such
aid
in
three
days
my
furlough
is
at
an
end
if
not
delivered
before
midnight
of
the
third
i
shall
have
to
mount
guard
for
another
fear
not
said
the
student
i
have
in
my
eye
the
very
priest
and
damsel
you
describe
but
how
am
i
to
regain
admission
to
this
tower
the
seal
of
solomon
will
open
the
way
for
the
student
issued
forth
from
the
tower
much
more
gayly
than
he
had
entered
the
wall
closed
behind
him
and
remained
solid
as
before
the
next
morning
he
repaired
boldly
to
the
mansion
of
the
priest
no
longer
a
poor
strolling
student
thrumming
his
way
with
a
guitar
but
an
ambassador
from
the
shadowy
world
with
enchanted
treasures
to
bestow
no
particulars
are
told
of
his
negotiation
excepting
that
the
zeal
of
the
worthy
priest
was
easily
kindled
at
the
idea
of
rescuing
an
old
soldier
of
the
faith
and
a
strong
box
of
king
chico
from
the
very
clutches
of
satan
and
then
what
alms
might
be
dispensed
what
churches
built
and
how
many
poor
relatives
enriched
with
the
moorish
treasure
as
to
the
immaculate
handmaid
she
was
ready
to
lend
her
hand
which
was
all
that
was
required
to
the
pious
work
and
if
a
shy
glance
now
and
then
might
be
believed
the
ambassador
began
to
find
favor
in
her
modest
eyes
the
greatest
difficulty
however
was
the
fast
to
which
the
good
padre
had
to
subject
himself
twice
he
attempted
it
and
twice
the
flesh
was
too
strong
for
the
spirit
it
was
only
on
the
third
day
that
he
was
enabled
to
withstand
the
temptations
of
the
cupboard
but
it
was
still
a
question
whether
he
would
hold
out
until
the
spell
was
broken
at
a
late
hour
of
the
night
the
party
groped
their
way
up
the
ravine
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
and
bearing
a
basket
with
provisions
for
exorcising
the
demon
of
hunger
so
soon
as
the
other
demons
should
be
laid
in
the
red
sea
the
seal
of
solomon
opened
their
way
into
the
tower
they
found
the
soldier
seated
on
the
enchanted
strong
box
awaiting
their
arrival
the
exorcism
was
performed
in
due
style
the
damsel
advanced
and
touched
the
locks
of
the
coffer
with
the
seal
of
solomon
the
lid
flew
open
and
such
treasures
of
gold
and
jewels
and
precious
stones
as
flashed
upon
the
eye
here
s
cut
and
come
again
cried
the
student
exultingly
as
he
proceeded
to
cram
his
pockets
fairly
and
softly
exclaimed
the
soldier
let
us
get
the
coffer
out
entire
and
then
they
accordingly
went
to
work
with
might
and
main
but
it
was
a
difficult
task
the
chest
was
enormously
heavy
and
had
been
embedded
there
for
centuries
while
they
were
thus
employed
the
good
dominie
drew
on
one
side
and
made
a
vigorous
onslaught
on
the
basket
by
way
of
exorcising
the
demon
of
hunger
which
was
raging
in
his
entrails
in
a
little
while
a
fat
capon
was
devoured
and
washed
down
by
a
deep
potation
of
val
de
peñas
and
by
way
of
grace
after
meat
he
gave
a
kiss
to
the
who
waited
on
him
it
was
quietly
done
in
a
corner
but
the
walls
babbled
it
forth
as
if
in
triumph
never
was
chaste
salute
more
awful
in
its
effects
at
the
sound
the
soldier
gave
a
great
cry
of
despair
the
coffer
which
was
half
raised
fell
back
in
its
place
and
was
locked
once
more
priest
student
and
damsel
found
themselves
outside
of
the
tower
the
wall
of
which
closed
with
a
thundering
jar
alas
the
good
padre
had
broken
his
fast
too
soon
when
recovered
from
his
surprise
the
student
would
have
reëntered
the
tower
but
learnt
to
his
dismay
that
the
damsel
in
her
fright
had
let
fall
the
seal
of
solomon
it
remained
within
the
vault
in
a
word
the
tolled
midnight
the
spell
was
renewed
the
soldier
was
doomed
to
mount
guard
for
another
hundred
years
and
there
he
and
the
treasure
remain
to
this
day
and
all
because
the
padre
kissed
his
housemaid
ah
father
father
said
the
student
shaking
his
head
ruefully
as
they
returned
down
the
ravine
i
fear
there
was
less
of
the
saint
than
the
sinner
in
that
kiss
thus
ends
the
legend
as
far
as
it
has
been
authenticated
there
is
a
tradition
however
that
the
student
had
brought
off
treasure
enough
in
his
pocket
to
set
him
up
in
the
world
that
he
prospered
in
his
affairs
that
the
worthy
padre
gave
him
the
in
marriage
by
way
of
amends
for
the
blunder
in
the
vault
that
the
immaculate
damsel
proved
a
pattern
for
wives
as
she
had
been
for
handmaids
and
bore
her
husband
a
numerous
progeny
that
the
first
was
a
wonder
it
was
born
seven
months
after
her
marriage
and
though
a
boy
was
the
sturdiest
of
the
flock
the
rest
were
all
born
in
the
ordinary
course
of
time
the
story
of
the
enchanted
soldier
remains
one
of
the
popular
traditions
of
granada
though
told
in
a
variety
of
ways
the
common
people
affirm
that
he
still
mounts
guard
on
eve
beside
the
gigantic
stone
pomegranate
on
the
bridge
of
the
darro
but
remains
invisible
excepting
to
such
lucky
mortal
as
may
possess
the
seal
of
solomon
notes
to
the
enchanted
soldier
among
the
ancient
superstitions
of
spain
were
those
of
the
existence
of
profound
caverns
in
which
the
magic
arts
were
taught
either
by
the
devil
in
person
or
some
sage
devoted
to
his
service
one
of
the
most
famous
of
these
caves
was
at
salamanca
don
francisco
de
torreblanca
makes
mention
of
it
in
the
first
book
of
his
work
on
magic
no
the
devil
was
said
to
play
the
part
of
oracle
there
giving
replies
to
those
who
repaired
thither
to
propound
fateful
questions
as
in
the
celebrated
cave
of
trophonius
don
francisco
though
he
records
this
story
does
not
put
faith
in
it
he
gives
it
however
as
certain
that
a
sacristan
named
clement
potosi
taught
secretly
the
magic
arts
in
that
cave
padre
feyjoo
who
inquired
into
the
matter
reports
it
as
a
vulgar
belief
that
the
devil
himself
taught
those
arts
there
admitting
only
seven
disciples
at
a
time
one
of
whom
to
be
determined
by
lot
was
to
be
devoted
to
him
body
and
soul
forever
among
one
of
these
sets
of
students
was
a
young
man
son
of
the
marquis
de
villena
on
whom
after
having
accomplished
his
studies
the
lot
fell
he
succeeded
however
in
cheating
the
devil
leaving
him
his
shadow
instead
of
his
body
don
juan
de
dios
professor
of
humanities
in
the
university
in
the
early
part
of
the
last
century
gives
the
following
version
of
the
story
extracted
as
he
says
from
an
ancient
manuscript
it
will
be
perceived
he
has
marred
the
supernatural
part
of
the
tale
and
ejected
the
devil
from
it
altogether
as
to
the
fable
of
the
cave
of
san
cyprian
says
he
all
that
we
have
been
able
to
verify
is
that
where
the
stone
cross
stands
in
the
small
square
or
place
called
by
the
name
of
the
seminary
of
carvajal
there
was
the
parochial
church
of
san
cyprian
a
descent
of
twenty
steps
led
down
to
a
subterranean
sacristy
spacious
and
vaulted
like
a
cave
here
a
sacristan
once
taught
magic
judicial
astrology
geomancy
hydromancy
pyromancy
acromancy
chiromancy
necromancy
the
extract
goes
on
to
state
that
seven
students
engaged
at
a
time
with
the
sacristan
at
a
fixed
stipend
lots
were
cast
among
them
which
one
of
their
number
should
pay
for
the
whole
with
the
understanding
that
he
on
whom
the
lot
fell
if
he
did
not
pay
promptly
should
be
detained
in
a
chamber
of
the
sacristy
until
the
funds
were
forthcoming
this
became
thenceforth
the
usual
practice
on
one
occasion
the
lot
fell
on
henry
de
villena
son
of
the
marquis
of
the
same
name
he
having
perceived
that
there
had
been
trick
and
shuffling
in
the
casting
of
the
lot
and
suspecting
the
sacristan
to
be
cognizant
thereof
refused
to
pay
he
was
forthwith
left
in
limbo
it
so
happened
that
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
sacristy
was
a
huge
jar
or
earthen
reservoir
for
water
which
was
cracked
and
empty
in
this
the
youth
contrived
to
conceal
himself
the
sacristan
returned
at
night
with
a
servant
bringing
lights
and
a
supper
unlocking
the
door
they
found
no
one
in
the
vault
and
a
book
of
magic
lying
open
on
the
table
they
retreated
in
dismay
leaving
the
door
open
by
which
villena
made
his
escape
the
story
went
about
that
through
magic
he
had
made
himself
the
reader
has
now
both
versions
of
the
story
and
may
make
his
choice
i
will
only
observe
that
the
sages
of
the
alhambra
incline
to
the
diabolical
one
this
henry
de
villena
flourished
in
the
time
of
juan
king
of
castile
of
whom
he
was
uncle
he
became
famous
for
his
knowledge
of
the
natural
sciences
and
hence
in
that
ignorant
age
was
stigmatized
as
a
necromancer
fernan
perez
de
guzman
in
his
account
of
distinguished
men
gives
him
credit
for
great
learning
but
says
he
devoted
himself
to
the
arts
of
divination
the
interpretation
of
dreams
of
signs
and
portents
at
the
death
of
villena
his
library
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
king
who
was
warned
that
it
contained
books
treating
of
magic
and
not
proper
to
be
read
king
juan
ordered
that
they
should
be
transported
in
carts
to
the
residence
of
a
reverend
prelate
to
be
examined
the
prelate
was
less
learned
than
devout
some
of
the
books
treated
of
mathematics
others
of
astronomy
with
figures
and
diagrams
and
planetary
signs
others
of
chemistry
or
alchemy
with
foreign
and
mystic
words
all
these
were
necromancy
in
the
eyes
of
the
pious
prelate
and
the
books
were
consigned
to
the
flames
like
the
library
of
don
quixote
the
seal
of
the
device
consists
of
two
equilateral
triangles
interlaced
so
as
to
form
a
star
and
surrounded
by
a
circle
according
to
arab
tradition
when
the
most
high
gave
solomon
the
choice
of
blessings
and
he
chose
wisdom
there
came
from
heaven
a
ring
on
which
this
device
was
engraven
this
mystic
talisman
was
the
arcanum
of
his
wisdom
felicity
and
grandeur
by
this
he
governed
and
prospered
in
consequence
of
a
temporary
lapse
from
virtue
he
lost
the
ring
in
the
sea
and
was
at
once
reduced
to
the
level
of
ordinary
men
by
penitence
and
prayer
he
made
his
peace
with
the
deity
was
permitted
to
find
his
ring
again
in
the
belly
of
a
fish
and
thus
recovered
his
celestial
gifts
that
he
might
not
utterly
lose
them
again
he
communicated
to
others
the
secret
of
the
marvellous
ring
this
symbolical
seal
we
are
told
was
sacrilegiously
used
by
the
mahometan
infidels
and
before
them
by
the
arabian
idolaters
and
before
them
by
the
hebrews
for
diabolical
enterprises
and
abominable
those
who
wish
to
be
more
thoroughly
informed
on
the
subject
will
do
well
to
consult
the
learned
father
athanasius
kirker
s
treatise
on
the
a
word
more
to
the
curious
reader
there
are
many
persons
in
these
skeptical
times
who
affect
to
deride
everything
connected
with
the
occult
sciences
or
black
art
who
have
no
faith
in
the
efficacy
of
conjurations
incantations
or
divinations
and
who
stoutly
contend
that
such
things
never
had
existence
to
such
determined
unbelievers
the
testimony
of
past
ages
is
as
nothing
they
require
the
evidence
of
their
own
senses
and
deny
that
such
arts
and
practices
have
prevailed
in
days
of
yore
simply
because
they
meet
with
no
instance
of
them
in
the
present
day
they
can
not
perceive
that
as
the
world
became
versed
in
the
natural
sciences
the
supernatural
became
superfluous
and
fell
into
disuse
and
that
the
hardy
inventions
of
art
superseded
the
mysteries
of
man
still
say
the
enlightened
few
those
mystic
powers
exist
though
in
a
latent
state
and
untasked
by
the
ingenuity
of
man
a
talisman
is
still
a
talisman
possessing
all
its
indwelling
and
awful
properties
though
it
may
have
lain
dormant
for
ages
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
or
in
the
dusty
cabinet
of
the
antiquary
the
signet
of
solomon
the
wise
for
instance
is
well
known
to
have
held
potent
control
over
genii
demons
and
enchantments
now
who
will
positively
assert
that
the
same
mystic
signet
wherever
it
may
exist
does
not
at
the
present
moment
possess
the
same
marvellous
virtues
which
distinguished
it
in
the
olden
time
let
those
who
doubt
repair
to
salamanca
delve
into
the
cave
of
san
cyprian
explore
its
hidden
secrets
and
decide
as
to
those
who
will
not
be
at
the
pains
of
such
investigation
let
them
substitute
faith
for
incredulity
and
receive
with
honest
credence
the
foregoing
legend
the
author
s
farewell
to
granada
my
serene
and
happy
reign
in
the
alhambra
was
suddenly
brought
to
a
close
by
letters
which
reached
me
while
indulging
in
oriental
luxury
in
the
cool
hall
of
the
baths
summoning
me
away
from
my
moslem
elysium
to
mingle
once
more
in
the
bustle
and
business
of
the
dusty
world
how
was
i
to
encounter
its
toils
and
turmoils
after
such
a
life
of
repose
and
reverie
how
was
i
to
endure
its
commonplace
after
the
poetry
of
the
alhambra
but
little
preparation
was
necessary
for
my
departure
a
vehicle
called
a
tartana
very
much
resembling
a
covered
cart
was
to
be
the
travelling
equipage
of
a
young
englishman
and
myself
through
murcia
to
alicant
and
valencia
on
our
way
to
france
and
a
varlet
who
had
been
a
contrabandista
and
for
aught
i
knew
a
robber
was
to
be
our
guide
and
guard
the
preparations
were
soon
made
but
the
departure
was
the
difficulty
day
after
day
was
it
postponed
day
after
day
was
spent
in
lingering
about
my
favorite
haunts
and
day
after
day
they
appeared
more
delightful
in
my
eyes
the
social
and
domestic
little
world
also
in
which
i
had
been
moving
had
become
singularly
endeared
to
me
and
the
concern
evinced
by
them
at
my
intended
departure
convinced
me
that
my
kind
feelings
were
reciprocated
indeed
when
at
length
the
day
arrived
i
did
not
dare
venture
upon
a
at
the
good
dame
antonia
s
i
saw
the
soft
heart
of
little
dolores
at
least
was
brim
full
and
ready
for
an
overflow
so
i
bade
a
silent
adieu
to
the
palace
and
its
inmates
and
descended
into
the
city
as
if
intending
to
return
there
however
the
tartana
and
the
guide
were
ready
so
after
taking
a
noonday
s
repast
with
my
at
the
posada
i
set
out
with
him
on
our
journey
humble
was
the
cortege
and
melancholy
the
departure
of
el
rey
chico
the
second
manuel
the
nephew
of
tia
antonia
mateo
my
officious
but
now
disconsolate
squire
and
two
or
three
old
invalids
of
the
alhambra
with
whom
i
had
grown
into
gossiping
companionship
had
come
down
to
see
me
off
for
it
is
one
of
the
good
old
customs
of
spain
to
sally
forth
several
miles
to
meet
a
coming
friend
and
to
accompany
him
as
far
on
his
departure
thus
then
we
set
out
our
guard
striding
ahead
with
his
escopeta
on
his
shoulder
manuel
and
mateo
on
each
side
of
the
tartana
and
the
old
invalids
behind
at
some
little
distance
to
the
north
of
granada
the
road
gradually
ascends
the
hills
here
i
alighted
and
walked
up
slowly
with
manuel
who
took
this
occasion
to
confide
to
me
the
secret
of
his
heart
and
of
all
those
tender
concerns
between
himself
and
dolores
with
which
i
had
been
already
informed
by
the
and
mateo
ximenes
his
doctor
s
diploma
had
prepared
the
way
for
their
union
and
nothing
more
was
wanting
but
the
dispensation
of
the
pope
on
account
of
their
consanguinity
then
if
he
could
get
the
post
of
medico
of
the
fortress
his
happiness
would
be
complete
i
congratulated
him
on
the
judgment
and
good
taste
he
had
shown
in
his
choice
of
a
helpmate
invoked
all
possible
felicity
on
their
union
and
trusted
that
the
abundant
affections
of
the
little
dolores
would
in
time
have
more
stable
objects
to
occupy
them
than
recreant
cats
and
truant
pigeons
it
was
indeed
a
sorrowful
parting
when
i
took
leave
of
these
good
people
and
saw
them
slowly
descend
the
hills
now
and
then
turning
round
to
wave
me
a
last
adieu
manuel
it
is
true
had
cheerful
prospects
to
console
him
but
poor
mateo
seemed
perfectly
cast
down
it
was
to
him
a
grievous
fall
from
the
station
of
prime
minister
and
historiographer
to
his
old
brown
cloak
and
his
starveling
mystery
of
and
the
poor
devil
notwithstanding
his
occasional
officiousness
had
somehow
or
other
acquired
a
stronger
hold
on
my
sympathies
than
i
was
aware
of
it
would
have
really
been
a
consolation
in
parting
could
i
have
anticipated
the
good
fortune
in
store
for
him
and
to
which
i
had
contributed
for
the
importance
i
had
appeared
to
give
to
his
tales
and
gossip
and
local
knowledge
and
the
frequent
companionship
in
which
i
had
indulged
him
in
the
course
of
my
strolls
had
elevated
his
idea
of
his
own
qualifications
and
opened
a
new
career
to
him
and
the
son
of
the
alhambra
has
since
become
its
regular
and
cicerone
insomuch
that
i
am
told
he
has
never
been
obliged
to
resume
the
ragged
old
brown
cloak
in
which
i
first
found
him
towards
sunset
i
came
to
where
the
road
wound
into
the
mountains
and
here
i
paused
to
take
a
last
look
at
granada
the
hill
on
which
i
stood
commanded
a
glorious
view
of
the
city
the
vega
and
the
surrounding
mountains
it
was
at
an
opposite
point
of
the
compass
from
cuesta
de
las
the
hill
of
tears
noted
for
the
last
sigh
of
the
i
now
could
realize
something
of
the
feelings
of
poor
boabdil
when
he
bade
adieu
to
the
paradise
he
was
leaving
behind
and
beheld
before
him
a
rugged
and
sterile
road
conducting
him
to
exile
the
setting
sun
as
usual
shed
a
melancholy
effulgence
on
the
ruddy
towers
of
the
alhambra
i
could
faintly
discern
the
balconied
window
of
the
tower
of
comares
where
i
had
indulged
in
so
many
delightful
reveries
the
bosky
groves
and
gardens
about
the
city
were
richly
gilded
with
the
sunshine
the
purple
haze
of
a
summer
evening
was
gathering
over
the
vega
everything
was
lovely
but
tenderly
and
sadly
so
to
my
parting
gaze
i
will
hasten
from
this
prospect
thought
i
before
the
sun
is
set
i
will
carry
away
a
recollection
of
it
clothed
in
all
its
with
these
thoughts
i
pursued
my
way
among
the
mountains
a
little
further
and
granada
the
vega
and
the
alhambra
were
shut
from
my
view
and
thus
ended
one
of
the
pleasantest
dreams
of
a
life
which
the
reader
perhaps
may
think
has
been
but
too
much
made
up
of
dreams

footnotes
note
to
the

the
author
feels
at
liberty
to
mention
that
his
travelling
companion
was

prince
dolgorouki
at
present
russian
minister
at
the
court

it
may
be
as
well
to
note
here
that
the

square
pockets
at
each
end
of
a
long
cloth
about
a
foot
and
a
half
wide
formed

the

thrown
over

hang

the

with
