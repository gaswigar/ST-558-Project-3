the
idea
of
the
sorry
plight
in
which
i
had
left
the
marquis
de
prie
his
mistress
and
perhaps
all
the
company
who
had
undoubtedly
coveted
the
contents
of
my
amused
me
till
i
reached
chamberi
where
i
only
stopped
to
change
horses
when
i
reached
grenoble
where
i
intended
to
stay
a
week
i
did
not
find
my
lodging
to
my
liking
and
went
in
my
carriage
to
the
where
i
found
several
letters
amongst
others
one
from
madame
enclosing
a
letter
of
introduction
to
an
officer
named
valenglard
who
she
told
me
was
a
learned
man
and
would
present
me
at
all
the
best
houses
in
the
town
i
called
on
this
officer
and
received
a
cordial
welcome
after
reading
madame
letter
he
said
he
was
ready
to
be
useful
to
me
in
anything
i
pleased
he
was
an
amiable
middle
aged
man
and
fifteen
years
before
had
been
madame
friend
and
in
a
much
more
intimate
degree
the
friend
of
her
daughter
the
princess
de
toudeville
i
told
him
that
i
was
uncomfortable
at
the
inn
and
that
the
first
service
i
would
ask
of
him
would
be
to
procure
me
a
comfortable
lodging
he
rubbed
his
head
and
said
i
think
i
can
get
you
rooms
in
a
beautiful
house
but
it
is
outside
the
town
walls
the
is
an
excellent
cook
and
for
the
sake
of
doing
your
cooking
i
am
sure
he
will
lodge
you
for
nothing
i
do
wish
that
said
i
do
be
afraid
said
the
baron
he
will
make
it
up
by
means
of
his
dishes
and
besides
the
house
is
for
sale
and
costs
him
nothing
come
and
see
it
i
took
a
suite
of
three
rooms
and
ordered
supper
for
two
warning
the
man
that
i
was
dainty
liked
good
things
and
did
not
care
for
the
cost
i
also
begged
de
valenglard
to
sup
with
me
the
doorkeeper
said
that
if
i
was
not
pleased
with
his
cooking
i
had
only
to
say
so
and
in
that
case
i
should
have
nothing
to
pay
i
sent
for
my
carriage
and
felt
that
i
had
established
myself
in
my
new
abode
on
the
ground
floor
i
saw
three
charming
girls
and
the
wife
who
all
bowed
profoundly
de
valenglard
took
me
to
a
concert
with
the
idea
of
introducing
me
to
everybody
but
i
begged
him
not
to
do
so
as
i
wished
to
see
the
ladies
before
deciding
which
of
them
i
should
like
to
know
the
company
was
a
numerous
one
especially
where
women
were
concerned
but
the
only
one
to
attract
my
attention
was
a
pretty
and
brunette
whose
fine
figure
was
dressed
with
great
simplicity
her
charming
eyes
after
having
thrown
one
glance
in
my
direction
obstinately
refused
to
look
at
me
again
my
vanity
made
me
conclude
at
once
that
she
behaved
thus
only
to
increase
my
desire
of
knowing
her
and
to
give
me
plenty
of
time
to
examine
her
and
her
figure
the
proportions
of
which
were
not
concealed
by
her
simple
attire
success
begets
assurance
and
the
wish
is
father
to
the
thought
i
cast
a
hungry
gaze
on
this
young
lady
without
more
ado
just
as
if
all
the
women
in
europe
were
only
a
seraglio
kept
for
my
pleasures
i
told
the
baron
i
should
like
to
know
her
she
is
a
good
girl
said
he
who
sees
no
company
and
is
quite
poor
those
are
three
reasons
which
make
me
the
more
anxious
to
know
her
you
will
really
find
nothing
to
do
in
that
quarter
very
good
there
is
her
aunt
i
will
introduce
you
to
her
as
we
leave
the
after
doing
me
this
service
he
came
to
sup
with
me
the
and
cook
struck
me
as
being
very
like
lebel
he
made
his
two
pretty
daughters
wait
on
me
and
i
saw
that
valenglard
was
delighted
at
having
lodged
me
to
my
satisfaction
but
he
grumbled
when
he
saw
fifteen
dishes
he
is
making
a
fool
of
you
and
me
he
said
on
the
contrary
he
has
guessed
my
tastes
do
you
think
everything
was
very
good
i
do
deny
it
but
do
be
afraid
i
love
spending
my
money
i
beg
your
pardon
i
only
want
you
to
be
pleased
we
had
exquisite
wines
and
at
dessert
some
ratafia
superior
to
the
turkish
i
had
tasted
seventeen
years
before
at
yussuf
ali
when
my
landlord
came
up
at
the
end
of
supper
i
told
him
that
he
ought
to
be
louis
xv
head
cook
go
on
as
you
have
begun
and
do
better
if
you
can
but
let
me
have
your
bill
every
morning
you
are
quite
right
with
such
an
arrangement
one
can
tell
how
one
is
getting
on
i
should
like
you
always
to
give
me
ices
and
you
must
let
me
have
two
more
lights
but
unless
i
am
mistaken
those
are
candles
that
i
see
i
am
a
venetian
and
accustomed
to
wax
lights
that
is
your
servant
fault
sir
how
is
that
because
after
eating
a
good
supper
he
went
to
bed
saying
he
was
ill
thus
i
heard
nothing
as
to
how
you
liked
things
done
very
good
you
shall
learn
from
my
own
lips
he
asked
my
wife
to
make
chocolate
for
you
tomorrow
morning
he
gave
her
the
chocolate
i
will
make
it
myself
when
he
had
left
the
room
de
valenglard
said
in
a
manner
that
was
at
the
same
time
pleased
and
surprised
that
madame
had
been
apparently
joking
in
telling
him
to
spare
me
all
expense
it
her
goodness
of
heart
i
am
obliged
to
her
all
the
same
she
is
an
excellent
woman
we
stayed
at
table
till
eleven
discussing
in
numerable
pleasant
topics
and
animating
our
talk
with
that
choice
liqueur
made
at
grenoble
of
which
we
drank
a
bottle
it
is
composed
of
the
juice
of
cherries
brandy
sugar
and
cinnamon
and
can
not
be
surpassed
i
am
sure
by
the
nectar
of
olympus
i
sent
home
the
baron
in
my
carriage
after
thanking
him
for
his
services
and
begging
him
to
be
my
companion
early
and
late
while
i
stayed
at
grenoble
a
re
quest
which
he
granted
excepting
for
those
days
on
which
he
was
on
duty
at
supper
i
had
given
him
my
bill
of
exchange
on
zappata
which
i
endorsed
with
the
name
de
seingalt
which
madame
had
given
me
he
discounted
it
for
me
next
day
a
banker
brought
me
four
hundred
louis
and
i
had
thirteen
hundred
in
my
i
always
had
a
dread
of
penuriousness
and
i
delighted
myself
at
the
thought
that
de
valenglard
would
write
and
tell
madame
who
was
always
preaching
economy
to
me
what
he
had
seen
i
escorted
my
guest
to
the
carriage
and
i
was
agreeably
surprised
when
i
got
back
to
find
the
doorkeeper
two
charming
daughters
le
duc
had
not
waited
for
me
to
tell
him
to
find
some
pretext
for
not
serving
me
he
knew
my
tastes
and
that
when
there
were
pretty
girls
in
a
house
the
less
i
saw
of
him
the
better
i
was
pleased
the
frank
eagerness
of
the
two
girls
to
wait
on
me
their
utter
freedom
from
suspicion
or
coquetry
made
me
determine
that
i
would
shew
myself
deserving
of
their
trust
they
took
off
my
shoes
and
stockings
did
my
hair
and
put
on
my
with
perfect
propriety
on
both
sides
when
i
was
in
bed
i
wished
them
a
goodnight
and
told
them
to
shut
the
door
and
bring
me
my
chocolate
at
eight
next
morning
i
could
not
help
confessing
that
i
was
perfectly
happy
as
i
reflected
over
my
present
condition
i
enjoyed
perfect
health
i
was
in
the
prime
of
life
i
had
no
calls
on
me
i
was
thoroughly
independent
i
had
a
rich
store
of
experience
plenty
of
money
plenty
of
luck
and
i
was
a
favourite
with
women
the
pains
and
troubles
i
had
gone
through
had
been
followed
by
so
many
days
of
happiness
that
i
felt
disposed
to
bless
my
destiny
full
of
these
agreeable
thoughts
i
fell
asleep
and
all
the
night
my
dreams
were
of
happiness
and
of
the
pretty
brunette
who
had
played
with
me
at
the
concert
i
woke
with
thoughts
of
her
and
feeling
sure
that
we
should
become
acquainted
i
felt
curious
to
know
what
success
i
should
have
with
her
she
was
discreet
and
poor
and
as
i
was
discreet
in
my
own
way
she
ought
not
to
despise
my
friendship
at
eight
one
of
the
daughters
brought
me
my
chocolate
and
told
me
that
le
duc
had
got
the
fever
you
must
take
care
of
the
poor
fellow
my
cousin
has
just
taken
him
some
broth
what
is
your
name
my
name
is
rose
and
my
sister
is
manon
just
then
manon
came
in
with
my
shirt
on
which
she
had
put
fresh
lace
i
thanked
her
and
she
said
with
a
blush
that
she
did
her
father
hair
very
well
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
and
i
shall
be
very
pleased
if
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
do
the
same
offices
for
me
till
my
servant
recovers
with
pleasure
sir
and
i
said
rose
laughing
will
shave
you
i
should
like
to
see
how
you
do
it
get
the
water
i
rose
hastily
while
manon
was
preparing
to
do
my
hair
rose
returned
and
shaved
me
admirably
as
soon
as
she
had
washed
off
the
lather
i
said
you
must
give
me
a
kiss
presenting
my
cheek
to
her
she
pretended
not
to
understand
i
shall
be
vexed
said
i
gravely
but
pleasantly
if
you
refuse
to
kiss
me
she
begged
to
be
excused
saying
with
a
little
smile
that
it
was
not
customary
to
do
so
at
grenoble
well
if
you
wo
kiss
me
you
sha
shave
me
the
father
came
in
at
that
point
bringing
his
bill
your
daughter
has
just
shaved
me
admirably
said
i
and
she
refuses
to
kiss
me
because
it
is
not
the
custom
at
grenoble
you
little
silly
said
he
it
is
the
custom
in
paris
you
kiss
me
fast
enough
after
you
have
shaved
me
why
should
you
be
less
polite
to
this
gentleman
she
then
kissed
me
with
an
air
of
submission
to
the
paternal
decree
which
made
manon
laugh
ah
said
the
father
your
turn
will
come
when
you
have
finished
doing
the
gentleman
hair
he
was
a
cunning
fellow
who
knew
the
best
way
to
prevent
me
cheapening
him
but
there
was
no
need
as
i
thought
his
charges
reasonable
and
as
i
paid
him
in
full
he
went
off
in
great
glee
manon
did
my
hair
as
well
as
my
dear
dubois
and
kissed
me
when
she
had
done
without
making
as
many
difficulties
as
rose
i
thought
i
should
get
on
well
with
both
of
them
they
went
downstairs
when
the
banker
was
announced
he
was
quite
a
young
man
and
after
he
had
counted
me
out
four
hundred
louis
he
observed
that
i
must
be
very
comfortable
certainly
said
i
the
two
sisters
are
delightful
their
cousin
is
better
they
are
too
discreet
i
suppose
they
are
well
off
the
father
has
two
thousand
francs
a
year
they
will
be
able
to
marry
tradesmen
i
was
curious
to
see
the
cousin
who
was
said
to
be
prettier
than
the
sisters
and
as
soon
as
the
banker
had
gone
i
went
downstairs
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
i
met
the
father
and
asked
him
which
was
le
duc
room
and
thereon
i
went
to
see
my
fine
fellow
i
found
him
sitting
up
in
a
comfortable
bed
with
a
rubicund
face
which
did
not
look
as
if
he
were
dangerously
what
is
the
matter
with
you
nothing
sir
i
am
having
a
fine
time
of
it
yesterday
i
thought
i
would
be
what
made
you
think
that
the
sight
of
the
three
graces
here
who
are
made
of
better
stuff
than
your
handsome
housekeeper
who
would
not
let
me
kiss
her
they
are
making
me
wait
too
long
for
my
broth
however
i
shall
have
to
speak
severely
about
it
le
duc
you
are
a
rascal
do
you
want
me
to
get
well
i
want
you
to
put
a
stop
to
this
farce
as
i
do
like
it
just
then
the
door
opened
and
the
cousin
came
in
with
the
broth
i
thought
her
ravishing
and
i
noticed
that
in
waiting
on
le
duc
she
had
an
imperious
little
air
which
well
became
her
i
shall
dine
in
bed
said
my
spaniard
you
shall
be
attended
to
said
the
pretty
girl
and
she
went
out
she
puts
on
big
airs
said
le
duc
but
that
does
not
impose
on
me
do
you
think
she
is
very
pretty
i
think
you
are
very
impudent
you
ape
your
betters
and
i
do
approve
of
it
get
up
you
must
wait
on
me
at
table
and
afterwards
you
will
eat
your
dinner
by
yourself
and
try
to
get
yourself
respected
as
an
honest
man
always
is
whatever
his
condition
so
long
as
he
does
not
forget
himself
you
must
not
stay
any
longer
in
this
room
the
doorkeeper
will
give
you
another
i
went
out
and
on
meeting
the
fair
cousin
i
told
her
that
i
was
jealous
of
the
honour
which
she
had
done
my
man
and
that
i
begged
her
to
wait
on
him
no
longer
oh
i
am
very
glad
the
came
up
and
i
gave
him
my
orders
and
went
back
to
my
room
to
write
before
dinner
the
baron
came
and
told
me
that
he
had
just
come
from
the
lady
to
whom
he
had
introduced
me
she
was
the
wife
of
a
barrister
named
morin
and
aunt
to
the
young
lady
who
had
so
interested
me
i
have
been
talking
of
you
said
the
baron
and
of
the
impression
her
niece
made
on
you
she
promised
to
send
for
her
and
to
keep
her
at
the
house
all
day
after
a
dinner
as
good
as
the
supper
of
the
night
before
though
different
from
it
in
its
details
and
appetising
enough
to
awaken
the
dead
we
went
to
see
madame
morin
who
received
us
with
the
easy
grace
of
a
parisian
lady
she
introduced
me
to
seven
children
of
whom
she
was
the
mother
her
eldest
daughter
an
girl
was
twelve
years
old
but
i
should
have
taken
her
to
be
fourteen
and
said
so
to
convince
me
of
her
age
the
mother
brought
a
book
in
which
the
year
the
month
the
day
the
hour
and
even
the
minute
of
her
birth
were
entered
i
was
astonished
at
such
minute
accuracy
and
asked
if
she
had
had
a
horoscope
drawn
no
said
she
i
have
never
found
anybody
to
do
it
it
is
never
too
late
i
replied
and
without
doubt
god
has
willed
that
this
pleasure
should
be
reserved
for
me
at
this
moment
morin
came
in
his
wife
introduced
me
and
after
the
customary
compliments
had
passed
she
returned
to
the
subject
of
the
horoscope
the
barrister
sensibly
observed
that
if
judicial
astrology
was
not
wholly
false
it
was
nevertheless
a
suspected
science
that
he
had
been
so
foolish
as
once
to
devote
a
considerable
portion
of
his
time
to
it
but
that
on
recognizing
the
inability
of
man
to
deal
with
the
future
he
had
abandoned
astrology
contenting
himself
with
the
veritable
truths
of
astronomy
i
saw
with
pleasure
that
i
had
to
deal
with
a
man
of
sense
and
education
but
valenglard
who
was
a
believer
in
astrology
began
an
argument
with
him
on
the
subject
during
their
discussion
i
quietly
copied
out
on
my
tablets
the
date
of
mdlle
morin
birth
but
morin
saw
what
i
was
about
and
shook
his
head
at
me
with
a
smile
i
understood
what
he
meant
but
i
did
not
allow
that
to
disconcert
me
as
i
had
made
up
my
mind
fully
five
minutes
ago
that
i
would
play
the
astrologer
on
this
occasion
at
last
the
fair
niece
arrived
her
aunt
introduced
me
to
her
as
mdlle
roman
coupier
her
sister
daughter
and
then
turning
to
her
she
informed
her
how
ardently
i
had
been
longing
to
know
her
since
i
had
seen
her
at
the
concert
she
was
then
seventeen
her
satin
skin
by
its
dazzling
whiteness
displayed
to
greater
advantage
her
magnificent
black
hair
her
features
were
perfectly
regular
and
her
complexion
had
a
slight
tinge
of
red
her
fine
eyes
were
at
once
sweet
and
sparkling
her
eyebrows
were
well
arched
her
mouth
small
her
teeth
regular
and
as
white
as
pearls
and
her
lips
of
an
exquisite
rosy
hue
afforded
a
seat
to
the
deities
of
grace
and
modesty
after
some
moments
conversation
morin
was
obliged
to
go
out
on
business
and
a
game
of
quadrille
was
proposed
at
which
i
was
greatly
pitied
for
having
lost
a
louis
i
thought
mdlle
roman
discreet
judicious
pleasant
without
being
brilliant
and
still
better
without
any
pretensions
she
was
and
had
a
natural
art
which
did
not
allow
her
to
seem
to
understand
too
flattering
a
compliment
or
a
joke
which
passed
in
any
way
the
bounds
of
propriety
she
was
neatly
dressed
but
had
no
ornaments
and
nothing
which
shewed
wealth
neither
rings
nor
a
watch
one
might
have
said
that
her
beauty
was
her
only
adornment
the
only
ornament
she
wore
being
a
small
gold
cross
hanging
from
her
necklace
of
black
ribbon
her
breast
was
well
shaped
and
not
too
large
fashion
and
custom
made
her
shew
half
of
it
as
innocently
as
she
shewed
her
plump
white
hand
or
her
cheeks
whereon
the
lily
and
the
rose
were
wedded
i
looked
at
her
features
to
see
if
i
might
hope
at
all
but
i
was
completely
puzzled
and
could
come
to
no
conclusion
she
gave
no
sign
which
made
me
hope
but
on
the
other
hand
she
did
nothing
to
make
me
despair
she
was
so
natural
and
so
reserved
that
my
sagacity
was
completely
at
fault
nevertheless
a
liberty
which
i
took
at
supper
gave
me
a
gleam
of
hope
her
napkin
fell
down
and
in
returning
it
to
her
i
pressed
her
thigh
amorously
and
could
not
detect
the
slightest
displeasure
on
her
features
content
with
so
much
i
begged
everybody
to
come
to
dinner
with
me
next
day
telling
madame
morin
that
i
should
not
be
going
out
and
that
i
was
therefore
delighted
to
put
my
carriage
at
her
service
when
i
had
taken
valenglard
home
i
went
to
my
lodging
building
castles
in
spain
as
to
the
conquest
of
mdlle
roman
i
warned
my
landlord
that
we
should
be
six
at
dinner
and
supper
the
following
day
and
then
i
went
to
bed
as
le
duc
was
undressing
me
he
said
sir
you
are
punishing
me
but
what
makes
me
sorry
you
are
punishing
yourself
in
depriving
yourself
of
the
services
of
those
pretty
girls
you
are
a
rogue
i
know
it
but
i
serve
you
with
all
my
heart
and
i
love
your
pleasure
as
well
as
my
own
you
plead
well
for
yourself
i
am
afraid
i
have
spoilt
you
shall
i
do
your
hair
no
you
may
go
out
every
day
till
i
shall
be
certain
to
catch
it
then
i
shall
send
you
to
the
hospital
that
is
a
fine
prospect
dios
he
was
impudent
sly
profligate
and
a
rascally
fellow
but
also
obedient
devoted
discreet
and
faithful
and
his
good
qualities
made
me
overlook
his
defects
next
morning
when
rose
brought
my
chocolate
she
told
me
with
a
laugh
that
my
man
had
sent
for
a
carriage
and
after
dressing
himself
in
the
height
of
fashion
he
had
gone
off
with
his
sword
at
his
side
to
pay
calls
as
he
said
we
laughed
at
him
you
were
quite
right
my
dear
rose
as
i
spoke
manon
came
in
under
some
pretext
or
other
i
saw
that
the
two
sisters
had
an
understanding
never
to
be
alone
with
me
i
was
displeased
but
pretended
not
to
notice
anything
i
got
up
and
i
had
scarcely
put
on
my
when
the
cousin
came
in
with
a
packet
under
her
arm
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
and
above
all
to
look
at
your
smiling
face
for
i
thought
you
much
too
serious
yesterday
that
because
le
duc
is
a
greater
gentleman
than
you
are
i
should
not
have
presumed
to
laugh
in
his
presence
but
i
had
my
reward
in
seeing
him
start
off
this
morning
in
his
gilded
coach
did
he
see
you
laughing
at
him
yes
unless
he
is
blind
he
will
be
vexed
all
the
better
you
are
really
very
charming
what
have
you
got
in
that
parcel
some
goods
of
our
own
manufacture
look
they
are
embroidered
gloves
they
are
beautiful
the
embroidery
is
exquisitely
done
how
much
for
the
lot
are
you
a
good
hand
at
a
bargain
certainly
then
we
must
take
that
into
account
after
some
whisperings
together
the
cousin
took
a
pen
put
down
the
numbers
of
gloves
added
up
and
said
the
lot
will
cost
you
two
hundred
and
ten
francs
there
are
nine
louis
give
me
six
francs
change
but
you
told
us
you
would
make
a
bargain
you
were
wrong
to
believe
it
she
blushed
and
gave
me
the
six
francs
rose
and
manon
shaved
me
and
did
my
hair
giving
me
a
kiss
with
the
best
grace
imaginable
and
when
i
offered
my
cheek
to
the
cousin
she
kissed
me
on
the
mouth
in
a
manner
that
told
me
she
would
be
wholly
mine
on
the
first
opportunity
shall
we
have
the
pleasure
of
waiting
on
you
at
the
table
said
rose
i
wish
you
would
but
we
should
like
to
know
who
is
coming
to
dinner
first
as
if
it
is
officers
from
the
garrison
we
dare
not
come
they
make
so
free
my
guests
are
madame
morin
her
husband
and
her
niece
very
good
the
cousin
said
mdlle
roman
is
the
prettiest
and
the
best
girl
in
grenoble
but
she
will
find
some
difficulty
in
marrying
as
she
has
no
money
she
may
meet
some
rich
man
who
will
think
her
goodness
and
her
beauty
worth
a
million
of
money
there
are
not
many
men
of
that
kind
no
but
there
are
a
few
manon
and
the
cousin
went
out
and
i
was
left
alone
with
rose
who
stayed
to
dress
me
i
attacked
her
but
she
defended
herself
so
resolutely
that
i
desisted
and
promised
it
should
not
occur
again
when
she
had
finished
i
gave
her
a
louis
thanked
her
and
sent
her
away
as
soon
as
i
was
alone
i
locked
the
door
and
proceeded
to
concoct
the
horoscope
i
had
promised
to
madame
morin
i
found
it
an
easy
task
to
fill
eight
pages
with
learned
folly
and
i
confined
myself
chiefly
to
declaring
the
events
which
had
already
happened
to
the
native
i
had
deftly
extracted
some
items
of
information
in
the
course
of
conversation
and
filling
up
the
rest
according
to
the
laws
of
probability
and
dressing
up
the
whole
in
astrological
diction
i
was
pronounced
to
be
a
seer
and
no
doubts
were
cast
on
my
skill
i
did
not
indeed
run
much
risk
for
everything
hung
from
an
if
and
in
the
judicious
employment
of
ifs
lies
the
secret
of
all
astrology
i
carefully
the
document
and
thought
it
admirable
i
felt
in
the
vein
and
the
use
of
the
cabala
had
made
me
an
expert
in
this
sort
of
thing
just
after
noon
all
my
guests
arrived
and
at
one
we
sat
down
to
table
i
have
never
seen
a
more
sumptuous
or
more
delicate
repast
i
saw
that
the
cook
was
an
artist
more
in
need
of
restraint
than
encouragement
madame
morin
was
very
polite
to
the
three
girls
whom
she
knew
well
and
le
duc
stood
behind
her
chair
all
the
time
looking
after
her
wants
and
dressed
as
richly
as
the
king
chamberlain
when
we
had
nearly
finished
dinner
mdlle
roman
passed
a
compliment
on
my
three
fair
and
this
giving
me
occasion
to
speak
of
their
talents
i
got
up
and
brought
the
gloves
i
had
purchased
from
them
mdlle
roman
praised
the
quality
of
the
material
and
the
work
i
took
the
opportunity
and
begged
leave
of
the
aunt
to
give
her
and
her
niece
a
dozen
pair
apiece
i
obtained
this
favour
and
i
then
gave
madame
morin
the
horoscope
her
husband
read
it
and
though
an
unbeliever
he
was
forced
to
admire
as
all
the
deductions
were
taken
naturally
from
the
position
of
the
heavenly
bodies
at
the
instant
of
his
daughter
birth
we
spent
a
couple
of
hours
in
talking
about
astrology
and
the
same
time
in
playing
at
quadrille
and
then
we
took
a
walk
in
the
garden
where
i
was
politely
left
to
enjoy
the
society
of
the
fair
roman
our
dialogue
or
rather
my
monologue
turned
solely
on
the
profound
impression
she
had
made
on
me
on
the
passion
she
had
inspired
on
her
beauty
her
goodness
the
purity
of
my
intentions
and
on
my
need
of
love
lest
i
should
go
down
to
the
grave
the
most
hapless
of
men
sir
said
she
at
last
if
my
destiny
points
to
marriage
i
do
not
deny
that
i
should
be
happy
to
find
a
husband
like
you
i
was
emboldened
by
this
frank
declaration
and
seizing
her
hand
i
covered
it
with
fiery
kisses
saying
passionately
that
i
hoped
she
would
not
let
me
languish
long
she
turned
her
head
to
look
for
her
aunt
it
was
getting
dark
and
she
seemed
to
be
afraid
of
something
happening
to
her
she
drew
me
gently
with
her
and
on
rejoining
the
other
guests
we
returned
to
the
where
i
made
a
small
bank
at
faro
for
their
amusement
madame
morin
gave
her
daughter
and
niece
whose
pockets
were
empty
some
money
and
valenglard
directed
their
play
so
well
that
when
we
left
off
to
go
to
supper
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
that
each
of
the
three
ladies
had
won
two
or
three
louis
we
sat
at
table
till
midnight
a
cold
wind
from
the
alps
stopped
my
plan
of
proposing
a
short
turn
in
the
garden
madame
morin
overwhelmed
me
with
thanks
for
my
entertainment
and
i
gave
each
of
my
a
respectful
kiss
i
heard
singing
in
the
kitchen
and
on
going
in
i
found
le
duc
in
a
high
state
of
excitement
and
very
drunk
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
tried
to
rise
but
he
lost
his
centre
of
gravity
and
fell
right
under
the
kitchen
table
he
was
carried
away
to
bed
i
thought
this
accident
favourable
to
my
desire
of
amusing
myself
and
i
might
have
succeeded
if
the
three
graces
had
not
all
been
there
love
only
laughs
when
two
are
present
and
thus
it
is
that
the
ancient
mythology
tells
no
story
of
the
loves
of
the
graces
who
were
always
together
i
had
not
yet
found
an
opportunity
of
getting
my
three
maids
one
after
the
other
and
i
dared
not
risk
a
general
attack
which
might
have
lost
me
the
confidence
of
each
one
rose
i
saw
was
openly
jealous
of
her
cousin
as
she
kept
a
keen
after
her
movements
i
was
not
sorry
for
jealousy
leads
to
anger
and
anger
goes
a
long
way
when
i
was
in
bed
i
sent
them
away
with
a
modest
good
night
next
morning
rose
came
in
by
herself
to
ask
me
for
a
cake
of
chocolate
for
as
she
said
le
duc
was
now
ill
in
real
earnest
she
brought
me
the
box
and
i
gave
her
the
chocolate
and
in
doing
so
i
took
her
hand
and
shewed
her
how
well
i
loved
her
she
was
offended
drew
back
her
hand
sharply
and
left
the
room
a
moment
after
manon
came
in
under
the
pretext
of
shewing
me
a
piece
of
lace
i
had
torn
away
in
my
attempts
of
the
day
before
and
of
asking
me
if
she
should
mend
it
i
took
her
hand
to
kiss
it
but
she
did
not
give
me
time
presenting
her
lips
burning
with
desire
i
took
her
hand
again
and
it
was
just
on
the
spot
when
the
cousin
came
in
manon
held
the
piece
of
lace
and
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
my
answer
i
told
her
absently
that
i
should
be
obliged
if
she
would
mend
it
when
she
had
time
and
with
this
she
went
out
i
was
troubled
by
this
succession
of
disasters
and
thought
that
the
cousin
would
not
play
me
false
from
the
earnest
of
her
affection
which
she
had
given
me
the
day
before
in
that
ardent
kiss
of
hers
i
begged
her
to
give
me
my
handkerchief
and
gently
drew
her
hand
towards
me
her
mouth
fastened
to
mine
and
her
hand
which
she
left
to
my
pleasure
with
all
the
gentleness
of
a
lamb
was
already
in
motion
when
rose
came
in
with
my
chocolate
we
regained
our
composure
in
a
moment
but
i
was
furious
at
heart
i
scowled
at
rose
and
i
had
a
right
to
do
so
after
the
manner
in
which
she
had
repulsed
me
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
though
the
chocolate
was
excellent
i
pronounced
it
badly
made
i
chid
her
for
her
awkwardness
in
waiting
on
me
and
repulsed
her
at
every
step
when
i
got
up
i
would
not
let
her
shave
me
i
shaved
myself
which
seemed
to
humiliate
her
and
then
manon
did
my
hair
rose
and
the
cousin
then
went
out
as
if
to
make
common
cause
together
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
rose
was
less
angry
with
her
sister
than
her
cousin
as
manon
was
finishing
my
toilette
de
valenglard
came
in
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
the
officer
who
was
a
man
of
honour
and
of
much
sense
in
spite
of
his
belief
in
astrology
and
the
occult
sciences
said
that
he
thought
me
looking
rather
melancholy
and
that
if
my
sadness
had
any
connection
with
the
fair
roman
he
warned
me
to
think
no
more
of
her
unless
i
had
resolved
to
ask
her
hand
in
marriage
i
replied
that
to
put
an
end
to
all
difficulties
i
had
decided
on
leaving
grenoble
in
a
few
days
we
dined
together
and
we
then
called
on
madame
morin
with
whom
we
found
her
fair
niece
madame
morin
gave
me
a
flattering
welcome
and
mdlle
roman
received
me
so
graciously
that
i
was
emboldened
to
kiss
her
and
place
her
on
my
knee
the
aunt
laughed
the
niece
blushed
and
then
slipping
into
my
hand
a
little
piece
of
paper
made
her
escape
i
read
on
the
paper
the
year
day
hour
and
minute
of
her
birth
and
guessed
what
she
meant
she
meant
i
thought
that
i
could
do
nothing
with
her
before
i
had
drawn
up
her
horoscope
my
resolve
was
soon
taken
to
profit
by
this
circumstance
and
i
told
her
that
i
would
tell
her
whether
i
could
oblige
her
or
not
next
day
if
she
would
come
to
a
ball
i
was
giving
she
looked
at
her
aunt
and
my
invitation
was
accepted
just
then
the
servant
announced
the
russian
gentleman
i
saw
a
man
of
about
my
own
age
slightly
marked
with
the
and
dressed
as
a
traveller
he
accosted
madame
morin
with
easy
grace
was
welcomed
heartily
by
her
spoke
well
scarcely
gave
me
a
glance
and
did
not
say
a
word
to
the
nieces
in
the
evening
morin
came
in
and
the
russian
gave
him
a
small
phial
full
of
a
white
liquid
and
then
made
as
if
he
would
go
but
he
was
kept
to
supper
at
table
the
conversation
ran
on
this
marvellous
liquid
of
his
morin
told
me
that
he
had
cured
a
young
man
of
a
bruise
from
a
billiard
ball
in
five
minutes
by
only
rubbing
it
with
the
liquid
he
said
modestly
that
it
was
a
trifling
thing
of
his
own
invention
and
he
talked
a
good
deal
about
chemistry
to
valenglard
as
my
attention
was
taken
up
by
the
fair
mdlle
roman
i
could
not
take
part
in
their
conversation
my
hope
of
succeeding
with
her
on
the
following
day
absorbed
all
my
thoughts
as
i
was
going
away
with
valenglard
he
told
me
that
nobody
knew
who
the
russian
was
and
that
he
was
nevertheless
received
everywhere
has
he
a
carriage
and
servants
he
has
nothing
no
servants
and
no
money
where
did
he
come
from
from
the
skies
a
fair
abode
certainly
how
long
has
he
been
here
for
the
last
fortnight
he
visits
but
asks
for
nothing
how
does
he
live
on
credit
at
the
inn
he
is
supposed
to
be
waiting
for
his
carriage
and
servants
he
is
probably
a
vagabond
he
does
not
look
like
one
as
you
saw
for
yourself
and
his
diamonds
contradict
that
hypothesis
yes
if
they
are
not
imitation
stones
for
it
seems
to
me
that
if
they
were
real
he
would
sell
them
when
i
got
home
rose
came
by
herself
to
attend
on
me
but
she
continued
to
sulk
i
tried
to
rouse
her
up
but
as
i
had
no
success
i
ordered
her
to
go
and
tell
her
father
that
i
was
going
to
give
a
ball
next
day
in
the
room
by
the
garden
and
that
supper
was
to
be
laid
for
twenty
when
the
came
to
take
my
orders
the
following
morning
i
told
him
that
i
should
like
his
girls
to
dance
if
he
did
mind
at
this
rose
condescended
to
smile
and
i
thought
it
a
good
omen
just
as
she
went
out
with
her
father
manon
came
in
under
the
pretext
of
asking
me
what
lace
i
would
wear
for
the
day
i
found
her
as
gentle
as
a
lamb
and
as
loving
as
a
dove
the
affair
was
happily
consummated
but
we
had
a
narrow
escape
of
being
caught
by
rose
who
came
in
with
le
duc
and
begged
me
to
let
him
dance
promising
that
he
would
behave
himself
properly
i
was
glad
that
everybody
should
enjoy
themselves
and
consented
telling
him
to
thank
rose
who
had
got
him
this
favour
i
had
a
note
from
madame
morin
asking
me
if
she
might
bring
with
her
to
the
ball
two
ladies
of
her
acquaintance
and
their
daughters
i
replied
that
i
should
be
delighted
for
her
to
invite
not
only
as
many
ladies
but
as
many
gentlemen
as
she
pleased
as
i
had
ordered
supper
for
twenty
people
she
came
to
dinner
with
her
niece
and
valenglard
her
daughter
being
busy
dressing
and
her
husband
being
engaged
till
the
evening
she
assured
me
that
i
should
have
plenty
of
guests
the
fair
mdlle
roman
wore
the
same
dress
but
her
beauty
unadorned
was
dazzling
standing
by
me
she
asked
if
i
had
thought
about
her
horoscope
i
took
her
hand
made
her
sit
on
my
knee
and
promised
that
she
should
have
it
on
the
morrow
i
held
her
thus
pressing
her
charming
breasts
with
my
left
hand
and
imprinting
fiery
kisses
on
her
lips
which
she
only
opened
to
beg
me
to
calm
myself
she
was
more
astonished
than
afraid
to
see
me
trembling
and
though
she
defended
herself
successfully
she
did
not
lose
countenance
for
a
moment
and
in
spite
of
my
ardent
gaze
she
did
not
turn
her
face
away
i
calmed
myself
with
an
effort
and
her
eyes
expressed
the
satisfaction
of
one
who
has
vanquished
a
generous
enemy
by
the
force
of
reason
by
my
silence
i
praised
the
virtue
of
this
celestial
being
in
whose
destiny
i
only
had
a
part
by
one
of
those
caprices
of
chance
which
philosophy
seeks
to
explain
in
vain
madame
morin
came
up
to
me
and
asked
me
to
explain
some
points
in
her
daughter
horoscope
she
then
told
me
that
if
i
wanted
to
have
four
beauties
at
my
ball
she
had
only
to
write
a
couple
of
notes
i
shall
only
see
one
beauty
said
i
looking
at
her
niece
god
alone
knows
said
valenglard
what
people
will
say
in
grenoble
they
will
say
it
is
your
wedding
ball
said
madame
morin
to
her
niece
yes
and
they
will
doubtless
talk
of
my
magnificent
dress
my
lace
and
my
diamonds
said
the
niece
pleasantly
they
will
talk
of
your
beauty
your
wit
and
your
goodness
i
replied
passionately
goodness
which
will
make
your
husband
a
happy
man
there
was
a
silence
because
they
all
thought
i
was
alluding
to
myself
i
was
doing
nothing
of
the
sort
i
should
have
been
glad
to
give
five
hundred
louis
for
her
but
i
did
not
see
how
the
contract
was
to
be
drawn
up
and
i
was
not
going
to
throw
my
money
away
we
went
to
my
bedroom
and
while
mdlle
roman
was
amusing
herself
with
looking
at
the
jewellry
on
my
her
aunt
and
valenglard
examined
the
books
on
the
table
by
my
bedside
i
saw
madame
morin
going
to
the
window
and
looking
closely
at
something
she
held
in
her
hand
i
remembered
i
had
left
out
the
portrait
of
the
fair
nun
i
ran
to
her
and
begged
her
to
give
me
the
indecent
picture
i
had
so
foolishly
left
about
i
do
mind
the
indecency
of
it
she
said
but
what
strikes
me
is
the
exact
likeness
i
understood
everything
and
i
shuddered
at
the
carelessness
of
which
i
had
been
guilty
madam
i
said
that
is
the
portrait
of
a
venetian
lady
of
whom
i
was
very
found
i
daresay
but
it
very
curious
these
two
m
these
robes
sacrificed
to
love
everything
makes
my
surprise
greater
she
is
a
nun
and
named
m
m
and
a
welsh
niece
of
mine
at
camberi
is
also
named
m
m
and
belongs
to
the
same
order
nay
more
she
has
been
at
aix
whence
you
have
come
to
get
cured
of
an
illness
and
this
portrait
is
like
her
as
one
drop
of
water
is
like
another
if
you
go
to
chamberi
call
on
her
and
say
you
come
from
me
you
will
be
welcome
and
you
will
be
as
much
surprised
as
i
am
i
will
do
so
after
i
have
been
in
italy
however
i
will
not
shew
her
this
portrait
which
would
scandalize
her
i
will
put
it
away
carefully
i
beg
you
not
to
shew
it
to
anyone
you
may
rely
on
me
i
was
in
an
ecstasy
at
having
put
her
off
so
effectually
at
eight
all
my
guests
arrived
and
i
saw
before
me
all
the
fairest
ladies
and
the
noblest
gentlemen
of
grenoble
the
only
thing
which
vexed
me
was
the
compliments
they
lavished
on
me
as
is
customary
in
the
provinces
i
opened
the
ball
with
the
lady
pointed
out
to
me
by
valenglard
and
then
i
danced
with
all
the
ladies
in
succession
but
my
partner
in
all
the
square
dances
was
the
fair
mdlle
roman
who
shone
from
her
simplicity
at
least
in
my
eyes
after
a
quadrille
in
which
i
had
exerted
myself
a
good
deal
i
felt
hot
and
went
up
to
my
room
to
put
on
a
lighter
suit
and
as
i
was
doing
so
in
came
the
fair
cousin
who
asked
me
if
i
required
anything
yes
you
dearest
i
replied
going
up
to
her
and
taking
her
in
my
arms
did
anyone
see
you
coming
in
here
no
i
came
from
upstairs
and
my
cousins
are
in
the
that
is
capital
you
are
fair
as
love
himself
and
this
is
an
excellent
opportunity
for
skewing
you
how
much
i
love
you
good
heavens
what
are
you
doing
let
me
go
somebody
might
come
in
well
put
out
the
light
i
put
it
out
shut
the
door
and
my
head
full
of
mdlle
roman
the
cousin
found
me
as
ardent
as
i
should
have
been
with
that
delightful
person
i
confess
too
that
the
niece
was
well
worthy
of
being
loved
on
her
own
merits
i
found
her
perfect
perhaps
better
than
mdlle
roman
a
novice
would
have
been
in
spite
of
my
ardour
her
passion
was
soon
appeased
and
she
begged
me
to
let
her
go
and
i
did
so
but
it
was
quite
time
i
wanted
to
begin
over
again
but
she
was
afraid
that
our
absence
would
be
noticed
by
her
two
cousins
so
she
kissed
me
and
left
the
room
i
went
back
to
the
and
we
danced
on
till
the
king
of
came
to
tell
us
supper
was
ready
a
collation
composed
of
the
luxuries
which
the
season
and
the
country
afforded
covered
the
table
but
what
pleased
the
ladies
most
was
the
number
and
artistic
arrangement
of
the
wax
lights
i
sat
down
at
a
small
table
with
a
few
of
my
guests
and
i
received
the
most
pressing
invitations
to
spend
the
autumn
in
their
town
i
am
sure
that
if
i
had
accepted
i
should
have
been
treated
like
a
prince
for
the
nobility
of
grenoble
bear
the
highest
character
for
hospitality
i
told
them
that
if
it
had
been
possible
i
should
have
had
the
greatest
pleasure
in
accepting
their
invitation
and
in
that
case
i
should
have
been
delighted
to
have
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
family
of
an
illustrious
gentleman
a
friend
of
my
father
what
name
is
it
they
asked
me
altogether
bouchenu
de
valbonnais
he
was
my
uncle
ah
sir
you
must
come
and
stay
with
us
you
danced
with
my
daughter
what
was
your
father
name
this
story
which
i
invented
and
uttered
as
i
was
wont
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
turned
me
into
a
sort
of
wonder
in
the
eyes
of
the
worthy
people
after
we
had
laughed
jested
drank
and
eaten
we
rose
from
the
table
and
began
to
dance
anew
seeing
madame
morin
her
niece
and
valenglard
going
into
the
garden
i
followed
them
and
as
we
walked
in
the
moonlight
i
led
the
fair
mdlle
roman
through
a
covered
alley
but
all
my
fine
speeches
were
in
vain
i
could
do
nothing
i
held
her
between
my
arms
i
covered
her
with
burning
kisses
but
not
one
did
she
return
to
me
and
her
hands
offered
a
successful
resistance
to
my
hardy
attempts
by
a
sudden
effort
however
i
at
last
attained
the
porch
of
the
temple
of
love
and
held
her
in
such
a
way
that
further
resistance
would
have
been
of
no
avail
but
she
stopped
me
short
by
saying
in
a
voice
which
no
man
of
feeling
could
have
resisted
be
my
friend
sir
and
not
my
enemy
and
the
cause
of
my
ruin
i
knelt
before
her
and
taking
her
hand
begged
her
pardon
swearing
not
to
renew
my
attempts
i
then
rose
and
asked
her
to
kiss
me
as
a
pledge
of
her
forgiveness
we
rejoined
her
aunt
and
returned
to
the
but
with
all
my
endeavours
i
could
not
regain
my
calm
i
sat
down
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
i
asked
rose
who
passed
by
me
to
get
me
a
glass
of
lemonade
when
she
brought
it
she
gently
chid
me
for
not
having
danced
with
her
her
sister
or
her
cousin
it
will
give
people
but
a
poor
opinion
of
our
merits
i
am
tired
said
i
but
if
you
will
promise
to
be
kind
i
will
dance
a
minuet
with
you
what
do
want
me
to
do
said
she
go
into
my
bedroom
and
wait
for
me
there
in
the
dark
when
you
see
your
sister
and
your
cousin
busy
dancing
and
you
will
only
dance
with
me
i
swear
then
you
will
find
me
in
your
room
i
found
her
passionate
and
i
had
full
satisfaction
to
keep
my
word
with
her
i
waited
for
the
closing
minuet
for
having
danced
with
rose
i
felt
obliged
in
common
decency
to
dance
with
the
other
two
especially
as
i
owed
them
the
same
debt
at
the
ladies
began
to
vanish
and
as
i
put
the
morins
into
my
carriage
i
told
them
that
i
could
not
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
them
again
that
day
but
that
if
they
would
come
and
spend
the
whole
of
the
day
after
with
me
i
would
have
the
horoscope
ready
i
went
to
the
kitchen
to
thank
the
worthy
for
having
made
me
cut
such
a
gallant
figure
and
i
found
the
three
nymphs
there
filling
their
pockets
with
sweetmeats
he
told
them
laughing
that
as
the
master
was
there
they
might
rob
him
with
a
clear
conscience
and
i
bade
them
take
as
much
as
they
would
i
informed
the
that
i
should
not
dine
till
six
and
i
then
went
to
bed
i
awoke
at
noon
and
feeling
myself
well
rested
i
set
to
work
at
the
horoscope
and
i
resolved
to
tell
the
fair
mdlle
roman
that
fortune
awaited
her
at
paris
where
she
would
become
her
master
mistress
but
that
the
monarch
must
see
her
before
she
had
attained
her
eighteenth
year
as
at
that
time
her
destiny
would
take
a
different
turn
to
give
my
prophecy
authority
i
told
her
some
curious
circumstances
which
had
hitherto
happened
to
her
and
which
i
had
learnt
now
and
again
from
herself
or
madame
morin
without
pretending
to
heed
what
they
said
with
an
ephemeris
and
another
astrological
book
i
made
out
and
copied
in
six
hours
mdlle
roman
horoscope
and
i
had
so
well
arranged
it
that
it
struck
valenglard
and
even
morin
with
astonishment
and
made
the
two
ladies
quite
enthusiastic
my
horoscope
must
only
be
known
to
the
young
lady
and
her
family
who
would
no
doubt
keep
the
secret
well
after
i
had
put
the
finishing
touches
to
it
read
it
and
read
it
again
i
felt
certain
that
i
had
made
a
masterpiece
and
i
then
dined
in
bed
with
my
three
nymphs
i
was
polite
and
affectionate
to
them
all
and
we
were
all
happy
together
but
i
was
the
happiest
de
valenglard
came
to
see
me
early
the
next
day
and
informed
me
that
nobody
suspected
me
of
being
in
love
with
mdlle
roman
but
that
i
was
thought
to
be
amorous
of
my
landlord
girls
well
let
them
think
so
said
i
they
are
worthy
of
love
though
not
to
be
named
in
the
same
breath
with
one
past
compare
but
who
leaves
me
no
hope
let
me
tell
madame
all
about
it
certainly
i
shall
be
delighted
and
madame
morin
and
their
niece
came
at
noon
and
we
spent
the
hour
before
dinner
in
reading
the
horoscope
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
the
four
distinct
sorts
of
surprise
which
i
saw
before
me
the
interesting
mdlle
roman
looked
very
grave
and
not
knowing
whether
she
had
a
will
of
her
own
listened
to
what
was
said
in
silence
morin
looked
at
me
now
and
again
and
seeing
that
i
kept
a
serious
countenance
did
not
dare
to
laugh
valenglard
shewed
fanatic
belief
in
astrology
in
every
feature
madame
morin
seemed
struck
as
by
a
miracle
and
far
from
thinking
the
fact
prophesied
too
improbable
remarked
that
her
niece
was
much
more
worthy
of
becoming
her
sovereign
wife
or
mistress
than
the
bigoted
maintenon
had
been
she
would
never
have
done
anything
said
madame
morin
if
she
had
not
left
america
and
come
to
france
and
if
my
niece
does
not
go
to
paris
nobody
can
say
that
the
horoscope
has
prophesied
falsely
we
should
therefore
go
to
paris
but
how
is
it
to
be
done
i
do
see
my
way
to
it
the
prediction
of
the
birth
of
a
son
has
something
divine
and
entrancing
about
it
i
do
wish
to
seem
prejudiced
but
my
niece
has
certainly
more
qualifications
for
gaining
the
king
affection
than
the
maintenon
had
my
niece
is
a
good
girl
and
young
while
the
maintenon
was
no
longer
as
young
as
she
had
been
and
had
led
a
strange
life
before
she
became
a
devotee
but
we
shall
never
accomplish
this
journey
to
paris
nay
said
valenglard
in
a
serious
tone
which
struck
me
as
supremely
ridiculous
she
must
go
her
fate
must
be
fulfilled
the
fair
mdlle
roman
seemed
all
amazed
i
let
them
talk
on
and
we
sat
down
to
dinner
the
next
two
paragraphs
were
misplaced
in
the
original
likely
by
the
typesetter
and
have
been
inserted
here
where
it
seems
that
they
belong
i
hoped
i
should
be
asked
to
take
the
diamond
to
paris
myself
and
i
felt
inclined
to
grant
the
request
i
flattered
myself
that
they
could
not
do
without
me
and
that
i
should
get
what
i
wanted
if
not
for
love
at
any
rate
through
gratitude
indeed
who
knew
what
might
become
of
the
plan
the
monarch
would
be
sure
to
be
caught
directly
i
had
no
doubts
on
that
subject
for
where
is
the
man
in
love
who
does
not
think
that
his
beloved
object
will
win
the
hearts
of
all
others
for
the
moment
i
felt
quite
jealous
of
the
king
but
from
my
thorough
knowledge
of
my
own
inconstancy
i
felt
sure
that
my
jealousy
would
cease
when
my
love
had
been
rewarded
and
i
was
aware
that
louis
xv
did
not
altogether
hold
the
opinions
of
a
turk
in
such
concerns
what
gave
an
almost
divine
character
to
the
horoscope
was
the
prediction
of
a
son
to
be
born
who
would
make
the
happiness
of
france
and
could
only
come
from
the
royal
blood
and
from
a
singular
vessel
of
election
a
curious
fancy
increased
my
delight
namely
the
thought
of
becoming
a
famous
astrologer
in
an
age
when
reason
and
science
had
so
justly
demolished
astrology
i
enjoyed
the
thought
of
seeing
myself
sought
out
by
crowned
heads
which
are
always
the
more
accessible
to
superstitious
notions
i
determined
i
would
be
particular
to
whom
i
gave
my
advice
who
has
not
made
his
castles
in
spain
if
mdlle
roman
gave
birth
to
a
daughter
instead
of
a
son
i
should
be
amused
and
all
would
not
be
lost
for
a
son
might
come
afterwards
at
first
silence
reigned
and
then
the
conversation
ran
on
a
thousand
trifles
as
is
usual
in
good
society
but
by
degrees
as
i
had
thought
they
returned
to
the
horoscope
according
to
the
horoscope
said
the
aunt
the
king
is
to
fall
in
love
with
my
niece
in
her
eighteenth
year
she
is
now
close
on
it
what
are
we
to
do
where
are
we
to
get
the
hundred
louis
necessary
and
when
she
gets
to
paris
is
she
to
go
to
the
king
and
say
i
am
your
majesty
and
who
is
going
to
take
her
there
i
ca
my
aunt
roman
might
said
the
young
lady
blushing
up
to
her
eyes
at
the
roar
of
laughter
which
none
of
us
could
restrain
well
said
madame
morin
there
is
madame
varnier
of
the
rue
de
richelieu
she
is
an
aunt
of
yours
she
has
a
good
establishment
and
knows
everybody
see
said
valenglard
how
the
ways
of
destiny
are
made
plain
you
talk
of
a
hundred
louis
twelve
will
be
sufficient
to
take
you
to
madame
varnier
when
you
get
there
leave
the
rest
to
your
fate
which
will
surely
favour
you
if
you
do
go
to
paris
said
i
say
nothing
to
madame
roman
or
madame
varnier
about
the
horoscope
i
will
say
nothing
to
anyone
about
it
but
after
all
it
is
only
a
happy
dream
i
shall
never
see
paris
still
less
louis
xv
i
arose
and
going
to
my
i
took
out
a
roll
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
louis
which
i
gave
to
her
saying
it
was
a
packet
of
sweetmeats
it
felt
rather
heavy
and
on
opening
it
she
found
it
to
contain
fifty
which
she
took
for
medals
they
are
gold
said
valenglard
and
the
goldsmith
will
give
you
a
hundred
and
fifty
louis
for
them
added
morin
i
beg
you
will
keep
them
you
can
give
me
a
bill
payable
at
paris
when
you
become
rich
i
knew
she
would
refuse
to
accept
my
present
although
i
should
have
been
delighted
if
she
had
kept
the
money
but
i
admired
her
strength
of
mind
in
restraining
her
tears
and
that
without
disturbing
for
a
moment
the
smile
on
her
face
we
went
out
to
take
a
turn
in
the
garden
valenglard
and
madame
morin
began
on
the
topic
of
the
horoscope
anew
and
i
left
them
taking
mdlle
roman
with
me
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
said
she
when
we
were
out
of
hearing
of
the
others
if
this
horoscope
is
not
all
a
joke
no
i
answered
it
is
quite
serious
but
it
all
depends
on
an
if
if
you
do
not
go
to
paris
the
prophecy
will
never
be
fulfilled
you
must
think
so
certainly
or
you
would
never
have
offered
me
those
fifty
medals
do
me
the
pleasure
of
accepting
them
now
nobody
will
know
anything
about
it
no
i
can
not
though
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
but
why
should
you
want
to
give
me
such
a
large
sum
for
the
pleasure
of
contributing
to
your
happiness
and
in
the
hope
that
you
will
allow
me
to
love
you
if
you
really
love
met
why
should
i
oppose
your
love
you
need
not
buy
my
consent
and
to
be
happy
i
do
not
want
to
possess
the
king
of
france
if
you
did
but
know
to
what
my
desires
are
limited
tell
me
i
would
fain
find
a
kind
husband
rich
enough
for
us
not
to
lack
the
necessaries
of
life
but
how
if
you
did
not
love
him
if
he
was
a
good
kind
man
how
could
i
help
loving
him
i
see
that
you
do
not
know
what
love
is
you
are
right
i
do
not
know
the
love
that
maddens
and
i
thank
god
for
it
well
i
think
you
are
wise
may
god
preserve
you
from
that
love
you
say
that
as
soon
as
the
king
sees
me
he
will
fall
in
love
with
me
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
that
strikes
me
as
vastly
improbable
for
though
it
is
quite
possible
that
he
may
not
think
me
plain
or
he
might
even
pronounce
me
pretty
yet
i
do
not
think
he
will
become
so
madly
in
love
as
you
say
you
do
let
us
sit
down
you
have
only
got
to
fancy
that
the
king
will
take
the
same
liking
to
you
that
i
have
done
that
is
all
but
what
do
you
find
in
me
that
you
will
not
find
in
most
girls
of
my
age
i
certainly
may
have
struck
you
but
that
only
proves
that
i
was
born
to
exercise
this
sway
over
you
and
not
at
all
that
i
am
to
rule
the
king
in
like
manner
why
should
i
go
and
look
for
the
king
if
you
love
me
yourself
because
i
can
not
give
you
the
position
you
deserve
i
should
have
thought
you
had
plenty
of
money
then
there
another
reason
you
are
not
in
love
with
me
i
love
you
as
tenderly
as
if
i
were
your
wife
i
might
then
kiss
you
though
duty
now
forbids
my
doing
so
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
not
being
angry
with
me
for
being
so
happy
with
you
on
the
contrary
i
am
delighted
to
please
you
then
you
will
allow
me
to
call
on
you
at
an
early
hour
and
to
take
coffee
at
your
bedside
do
not
dream
of
such
a
thing
if
i
would
i
could
not
i
sleep
with
my
aunt
and
i
always
rise
at
the
same
time
she
does
take
away
your
hand
you
promised
not
to
do
it
again
in
god
name
let
me
alone
alas
i
had
to
stop
there
was
no
overcoming
her
but
what
pleased
me
extremely
was
that
in
spite
of
my
amorous
persecution
she
did
not
lose
that
smiling
calm
which
so
became
her
as
for
myself
i
looked
as
if
i
deserved
that
pardon
for
which
i
pleaded
on
my
knees
and
in
her
eyes
i
read
that
she
was
sorry
that
she
could
not
grant
what
i
required
of
her
i
could
no
longer
stay
beside
her
my
senses
were
too
excited
by
her
beauty
i
left
her
and
went
to
my
room
where
i
found
the
kind
manon
busying
herself
on
my
cuffs
and
she
gave
me
the
relief
i
wanted
and
when
we
were
both
satisfied
made
her
escape
i
reflected
that
i
should
never
obtain
more
than
i
had
obtained
hitherto
from
young
mdlle
roman
at
least
unless
i
gave
the
lie
to
my
horoscope
by
marrying
her
and
i
decided
that
i
would
not
take
any
further
steps
in
the
matter
i
returned
to
the
garden
and
going
up
to
the
aunt
i
begged
her
to
walk
with
me
in
vain
i
urged
the
worthy
woman
to
accept
a
hundred
louis
for
her
niece
journey
from
me
i
swore
to
her
by
all
i
held
sacred
that
no
one
else
should
ever
know
of
the
circumstance
all
my
eloquence
and
all
my
prayers
were
in
vain
she
told
me
that
if
her
niece
destiny
only
depended
on
that
journey
all
would
be
well
for
she
had
thought
over
a
plan
which
would
with
her
husband
consent
enable
mdlle
roman
to
go
to
paris
at
the
same
time
she
gave
me
her
sincerest
thanks
and
said
that
her
niece
was
very
fortunate
to
have
pleased
me
so
well
she
pleased
me
so
well
i
replied
that
i
have
resolved
to
go
away
to
avoid
making
proposals
to
you
which
would
bring
the
great
fortune
that
awaits
her
to
nought
if
it
were
not
for
that
i
should
have
been
happy
to
have
asked
her
hand
of
you
alas
her
happiness
would
perhaps
be
built
on
a
better
foundation
explain
yourself
i
dare
not
wage
war
with
fate
but
you
are
not
going
excuse
me
but
i
shall
call
to
take
leave
at
two
the
news
of
my
approaching
departure
saddened
the
madame
morin
who
for
all
i
know
may
be
alive
now
was
a
most
woman
at
table
she
announced
her
resolve
that
as
i
had
decided
on
going
and
as
i
should
only
leave
my
house
to
take
leave
of
her
she
would
not
force
me
to
put
myself
out
to
such
an
extent
and
ordained
that
our
farewells
should
be
said
that
evening
at
least
i
said
i
may
have
the
honour
of
escorting
you
to
your
door
that
will
protract
our
happiness
for
some
minutes
valenglard
went
away
on
foot
and
the
fair
mdlle
roman
sat
on
my
knee
i
dared
to
be
bold
with
her
and
contrary
to
expectation
she
shewed
herself
so
kind
that
i
was
half
sorry
i
was
going
but
the
die
was
cast
a
carriage
lying
overturned
on
the
road
outside
an
inn
made
my
coachman
stop
a
short
while
and
this
accident
which
made
the
poor
driver
curse
overwhelmed
me
with
joy
for
in
these
few
moments
i
obtained
all
the
favours
that
she
could
possibly
give
under
the
circumstances
happiness
enjoyed
alone
is
never
complete
mine
was
not
until
i
assured
myself
by
looking
at
my
sweetheart
features
that
the
part
she
had
taken
had
not
been
an
entirely
passive
one
and
i
escorted
the
ladies
to
their
room
there
without
any
conceit
i
was
certain
that
i
saw
sadness
and
love
upon
that
fair
creature
face
i
could
see
that
she
was
neither
cold
nor
insensible
and
that
the
obstacles
she
had
put
in
my
way
were
only
suggested
by
fear
and
virtue
i
gave
madame
morin
a
farewell
kiss
and
she
was
kind
enough
to
tell
her
niece
to
give
me
a
similar
mark
of
friendship
which
she
did
in
a
way
that
shewed
me
how
completely
she
had
shared
my
ardour
i
left
them
feeling
amorous
and
sorry
i
had
obliged
myself
to
go
on
entering
my
room
i
found
the
three
nymphs
together
which
vexed
me
as
i
only
wanted
one
i
whispered
my
wishes
to
rose
as
she
curled
my
hair
but
she
told
me
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
slip
away
as
they
all
slept
in
one
room
i
then
told
them
that
i
was
going
away
the
next
day
and
that
if
they
would
pass
the
night
with
me
i
would
give
them
a
present
of
six
louis
each
they
laughed
at
my
proposal
and
said
it
could
possibly
be
done
i
saw
by
this
they
had
not
made
confidantes
of
one
another
as
girls
mostly
do
and
i
also
saw
that
they
were
jealous
of
each
other
i
wished
them
a
good
night
and
as
soon
as
i
was
in
bed
the
god
of
dreams
took
me
under
his
care
and
made
me
pass
the
night
with
the
adorable
mdlle
roman
i
rang
rather
late
in
the
morning
and
the
cousin
came
in
and
said
that
rose
would
bring
my
chocolate
and
that
charles
ivanoff
wanted
to
speak
to
me
i
guessed
that
this
was
the
russian
but
as
he
had
not
been
introduced
to
me
i
thought
i
might
decline
to
see
him
tell
him
i
do
know
his
name
rose
went
out
and
came
in
again
saying
he
was
the
gentleman
who
had
had
the
honour
of
supping
with
me
at
madame
morin
tell
him
to
come
in
sir
said
he
i
want
to
speak
with
you
in
private
i
can
not
order
these
young
ladies
to
leave
my
room
sir
be
kind
enough
to
wait
for
me
outside
till
i
have
put
on
my
and
then
i
shall
be
ready
to
speak
to
you
if
i
am
troubling
you
i
will
call
again
you
would
not
find
me
as
i
am
leaving
grenoble
in
that
case
i
will
wait
i
got
up
in
haste
and
went
out
to
him
sir
said
he
i
must
leave
this
place
and
i
have
not
a
penny
to
pay
my
landlord
i
beg
of
you
to
come
to
my
aid
i
dare
not
have
recourse
to
anyone
else
in
the
town
for
fear
of
exposing
myself
to
the
insult
of
a
refusal
perhaps
i
ought
to
feel
myself
flattered
at
the
preference
you
have
shewn
me
but
without
wishing
to
insult
you
in
any
way
i
am
afraid
i
shall
be
obliged
to
refuse
your
request
if
you
knew
who
i
am
i
am
sure
you
would
not
refuse
me
some
small
help
if
you
think
so
tell
me
who
you
are
you
may
count
on
my
silence
i
am
charles
second
son
of
ivan
duke
of
courland
who
is
in
exile
in
siberia
i
made
my
escape
if
you
go
to
genoa
you
will
find
yourself
beyond
the
reach
of
poverty
for
no
doubt
the
brother
of
your
would
never
abandon
you
he
died
in
silesia
when
two
years
ago
i
believe
you
have
been
deceived
for
i
saw
him
at
stuttgart
scarcely
six
months
ago
he
is
the
baron
de
treiden
it
did
not
cost
me
much
to
get
wind
of
the
adventurer
but
i
felt
angry
that
he
had
had
the
impudence
to
try
and
dupe
me
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
i
would
willingly
have
given
him
six
louis
for
it
would
have
been
bad
form
on
my
part
to
declare
war
against
adventurers
as
i
was
one
myself
and
i
ought
to
have
pardoned
his
lies
as
nearly
all
adventurers
are
more
or
less
impostors
i
gave
a
glance
at
his
diamond
buckles
which
were
considered
real
at
grenoble
and
i
saw
directly
that
they
were
counterfeits
of
a
kind
made
in
venice
which
imitate
the
facets
of
the
diamonds
in
perfection
except
to
people
who
are
experienced
in
diamonds
you
have
diamond
buckles
said
i
why
do
you
sell
them
it
the
last
piece
of
jewellery
i
possess
out
of
all
my
mother
gave
me
and
i
promised
her
never
to
part
with
them
i
would
not
shew
those
buckles
if
i
were
you
your
pocket
would
be
a
better
place
for
them
i
may
tell
you
frankly
that
i
believe
the
stones
to
be
counterfeit
and
that
your
lie
displeases
me
sir
i
am
not
a
liar
we
shall
see
prove
that
the
stones
are
genuine
and
i
will
give
you
six
louis
i
shall
be
delighted
if
i
am
in
the
wrong
farewell
seeing
de
valerlglard
coming
up
to
my
door
he
begged
me
not
to
tell
him
of
what
had
passed
between
us
and
i
promised
that
i
would
tell
no
one
valenglard
came
to
wish
me
a
prosperous
journey
he
himself
was
obliged
to
go
with
monteinard
he
begged
me
to
correspond
constantly
with
him
and
i
had
been
intending
to
prefer
the
same
request
as
i
took
too
great
an
interest
in
the
fair
mdlle
roman
not
to
wish
to
hear
of
her
fate
and
the
correspondence
the
worthy
officer
desired
was
the
best
way
possible
for
me
to
hear
about
her
as
will
be
imagined
i
promised
what
he
asked
without
making
any
difficulty
he
shed
tears
as
he
embraced
me
and
i
promised
to
be
his
friend
chapter
ii
my
departure
from
grenoble
avignon
the
fountain
of
vaucluse
the
false
astrodi
and
the
humpback
gaetan
costa
i
arrive
at
marseilles
while
the
three
girls
were
helping
le
duc
to
pack
my
mails
my
landlord
entered
gave
me
his
bill
and
finding
everything
correct
i
paid
him
much
to
his
satisfaction
i
owed
him
a
compliment
too
at
which
he
seemed
extremely
gratified
sir
said
i
i
do
not
wish
to
leave
your
house
without
having
the
pleasure
of
dining
with
your
charming
girls
to
shew
them
how
i
appreciate
the
care
they
have
taken
of
me
let
me
have
then
a
delicate
repast
for
four
and
also
order
post
horses
that
i
may
start
in
the
evening
sir
broke
in
le
duc
i
entreat
you
to
order
a
besides
i
was
not
made
for
a
seat
behind
a
chaise
the
cousin
laughed
openly
at
his
vain
boasting
and
to
avenge
himself
the
rascal
told
her
that
he
was
better
than
she
nevertheless
le
duc
you
will
have
to
wait
on
her
at
table
yes
as
she
waits
on
you
in
bed
i
ran
for
my
stick
but
the
rogue
knowing
what
was
going
to
happen
opened
the
window
and
jumped
into
the
courtyard
the
girls
gave
a
shriek
of
terror
but
when
we
looked
out
we
saw
him
jumping
about
and
performing
a
thousand
apish
tricks
very
glad
to
find
that
he
had
not
broken
a
limb
i
called
out
come
back
i
forgive
you
the
girls
and
the
man
himself
who
escaped
so
readily
were
as
delighted
as
i
le
duc
came
in
in
high
spirits
observing
that
he
did
not
know
he
was
such
a
good
jumper
very
good
but
do
be
so
impudent
another
time
here
take
this
watch
so
saying
i
gave
him
a
valuable
gold
watch
which
he
received
saying
i
would
jump
again
for
another
watch
like
this
such
was
my
spaniard
whom
i
had
to
dismiss
two
years
afterwards
i
have
often
missed
him
the
hours
went
by
with
such
speed
when
i
was
seated
at
table
with
the
three
girls
whom
i
vainly
endeavoured
to
intoxicate
that
i
decided
that
i
would
not
leave
till
the
next
day
i
was
tired
of
making
mysteries
and
wanted
to
enjoy
them
all
together
and
resolved
that
the
orgy
should
take
place
that
night
i
told
them
that
if
they
would
pass
the
night
in
my
room
i
would
not
go
till
the
next
day
this
proposition
was
received
with
a
storm
of
exclamations
and
with
laughter
as
at
an
impossibility
while
i
endeavoured
to
excite
them
to
grant
my
request
in
the
midst
of
this
the
came
in
advising
me
not
to
travel
by
night
but
to
go
to
avignon
by
a
boat
in
which
i
could
ship
my
carriage
you
will
save
time
and
money
said
he
i
will
do
so
i
answered
if
these
girls
of
yours
will
keep
me
company
all
night
as
i
am
determined
i
will
not
go
to
bed
o
lord
said
he
with
a
laugh
that
their
business
this
decided
them
and
they
gave
in
the
sent
to
order
the
boat
and
promised
to
let
me
have
a
dainty
supper
by
midnight
the
hours
passed
by
in
jests
and
merriment
and
when
we
sat
down
to
supper
i
made
the
champagne
corks
fly
to
such
an
extent
that
the
girls
began
to
get
rather
gay
i
myself
felt
a
little
heated
and
as
i
held
each
one
secret
i
had
the
hardihood
to
tell
them
that
their
scruples
were
ridiculous
as
each
of
them
had
shewn
no
reserve
to
me
in
private
at
this
they
gazed
at
one
another
in
a
kind
of
blank
surprise
as
if
indignant
at
what
i
had
said
foreseeing
that
feminine
pride
might
prompt
them
to
treat
my
accusation
as
an
idle
calumny
i
resolved
not
to
give
them
time
and
drawing
manon
on
to
my
knee
i
embraced
her
with
such
ardour
that
she
gave
in
and
abandoned
herself
to
my
passion
her
example
overcame
the
others
and
for
five
hours
we
indulged
in
every
kind
of
voluptuous
enjoyment
at
the
end
of
that
time
we
were
all
in
need
of
rest
but
i
had
to
go
i
wanted
to
give
them
some
jewels
but
they
said
they
would
rather
i
ordered
gloves
to
the
amount
of
thirty
louis
the
money
to
be
paid
in
advance
and
the
gloves
not
to
be
called
for
i
went
to
sleep
on
board
the
boat
and
did
not
awake
till
we
got
to
avignon
i
was
conducted
to
the
inn
of
omen
and
supped
in
my
room
in
spite
of
the
marvellous
tales
which
le
duc
told
me
of
a
young
beauty
at
the
public
table
next
morning
my
spaniard
told
me
that
the
beauty
and
her
husband
slept
in
a
room
next
to
mine
at
the
same
time
he
brought
me
a
bill
of
the
play
and
i
saw
company
from
paris
with
mdlle
astrodi
who
was
to
sing
and
dance
i
gave
a
cry
of
wonder
and
exclaimed
the
famous
astrodi
at
avignon
how
she
will
be
astonished
to
see
me
not
wanting
to
live
in
hermit
fashion
i
went
downstairs
to
dine
at
the
public
table
and
i
found
a
score
of
people
sitting
down
to
such
a
choice
repast
that
i
could
not
conceive
how
it
could
be
done
for
forty
sous
a
head
the
fair
stranger
drew
all
eyes
and
especially
mine
towards
her
she
was
a
young
and
perfect
beauty
silent
her
eyes
fixed
on
a
napkin
replying
in
monosyllables
to
those
who
addressed
her
and
glancing
at
the
speaker
with
large
blue
eyes
the
beauty
of
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
describe
her
husband
was
seated
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
a
man
of
a
kind
that
inspires
contempt
at
the
first
glance
he
was
young
marked
with
the
a
greedy
eater
a
loud
talker
laughing
and
speaking
at
random
and
altogether
i
took
him
for
a
servant
in
disguise
feeling
sure
that
such
a
fellow
did
not
know
how
to
refuse
i
sent
him
a
glass
of
champagne
which
he
drank
off
to
my
health
forthwith
may
i
have
the
pleasure
of
sending
a
glass
to
your
wife
he
replied
with
a
roar
of
laughter
to
ask
her
myself
and
with
a
slight
bow
she
told
me
that
she
never
took
anything
to
drink
when
the
dessert
came
in
she
rose
and
her
husband
followed
her
to
their
room
a
stranger
who
like
myself
had
never
seen
her
before
asked
me
who
she
was
i
said
i
was
a
newcomer
and
did
not
know
and
somebody
else
said
that
her
husband
called
himself
the
chevalier
stuard
that
he
came
from
lyons
and
was
going
to
marseilles
he
came
it
appeared
to
avignon
a
week
ago
without
servants
and
in
a
very
poor
carriage
i
intended
staying
at
avignon
only
as
long
as
might
be
necessary
to
see
the
fountain
or
fall
of
vaucluse
and
so
i
had
not
got
any
letters
of
introduction
and
had
not
the
pretext
of
acquaintance
that
i
might
stay
and
enjoy
her
fine
eyes
but
an
italian
who
had
read
and
enjoyed
the
divine
petrarch
would
naturally
wish
to
see
the
place
made
divine
by
the
poet
love
for
laura
i
went
to
the
theatre
where
i
saw
the
salviati
women
of
fashion
neither
fair
nor
foul
and
a
wretched
comic
opera
but
i
neither
saw
astrodi
nor
any
other
actor
from
the
comedie
italienne
at
paris
where
is
the
famous
astrodi
said
i
to
a
young
man
sitting
by
me
i
have
not
seen
her
yet
excuse
me
she
has
danced
and
sang
before
your
eyes
by
jove
it
impossible
i
know
her
perfectly
and
if
she
has
so
changed
as
not
to
be
recognized
she
is
no
longer
herself
i
turned
to
go
and
two
minutes
after
the
young
man
i
had
addressed
came
up
and
begged
me
to
come
back
and
he
would
take
me
to
as
she
had
recognized
me
i
followed
him
without
saying
a
word
and
saw
a
girl
who
threw
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
addressed
me
by
my
name
though
i
could
have
sworn
i
had
never
seen
her
before
but
she
did
not
leave
me
time
to
speak
close
by
i
saw
a
man
who
gave
himself
out
as
the
father
of
the
famous
astrodi
who
was
known
to
all
paris
who
had
caused
the
death
of
the
comte
one
of
the
most
amiable
noblemen
of
the
court
of
louis
xv
i
thought
this
ugly
female
might
be
her
sister
so
i
sat
down
and
complimented
her
on
her
talents
she
asked
if
i
would
mind
her
changing
her
dress
and
in
a
moment
she
was
running
here
and
there
laughing
and
shewing
a
liberality
which
possibly
might
have
been
absent
if
what
she
had
to
display
had
been
worth
seeing
i
laughed
internally
at
her
wiles
for
after
my
experiences
at
grenoble
she
would
have
found
it
a
hard
task
to
arouse
my
desires
if
she
had
been
as
pretty
as
she
was
ugly
her
thinness
and
her
tawny
skin
could
not
divert
my
attention
from
other
still
less
pleasing
features
about
her
i
admired
her
confidence
in
spite
of
her
disadvantages
she
must
have
credited
me
with
a
diabolic
appetite
but
these
women
often
contrive
to
extract
charms
out
of
their
depravity
which
their
delicacy
would
be
impotent
to
furnish
she
begged
me
to
sup
with
her
and
as
she
persisted
i
was
obliged
to
refuse
her
in
a
way
i
should
not
have
allowed
myself
to
use
with
any
other
woman
she
then
begged
me
to
take
four
tickets
for
the
play
the
next
day
which
was
to
be
for
her
benefit
i
saw
it
was
only
a
matter
of
twelve
francs
and
delighted
to
be
quit
of
her
so
cheaply
i
told
her
to
give
me
sixteen
i
thought
she
would
have
gone
mad
with
joy
when
i
gave
her
a
double
louis
she
was
not
the
real
astrodi
i
went
back
to
my
inn
and
had
a
delicious
supper
in
my
own
room
while
le
duc
was
doing
my
hair
before
i
went
to
bed
he
told
me
that
the
landlord
had
paid
a
visit
to
the
fair
stranger
and
her
husband
before
supper
and
had
said
in
clear
terms
that
he
must
be
paid
next
morning
and
if
he
were
not
no
place
would
be
laid
for
them
at
table
and
their
linen
would
be
detained
who
told
you
that
i
heard
it
from
here
their
room
is
only
separated
from
this
by
a
wooden
partition
if
they
were
in
it
now
i
am
sure
they
could
hear
all
we
are
saying
where
are
they
then
at
table
where
they
are
eating
for
but
the
lady
is
crying
there
a
fine
chance
for
you
sir
be
quiet
i
sha
have
anything
to
do
with
it
it
a
trap
for
a
woman
of
any
worth
would
die
rather
than
weep
at
a
public
table
ah
if
you
saw
how
pretty
she
looks
in
tears
i
am
only
a
poor
devil
but
i
would
willingly
give
her
two
louis
if
she
would
earn
them
go
and
offer
her
the
money
a
moment
after
the
gentleman
and
his
wife
came
back
to
their
room
and
i
heard
the
loud
voice
of
the
one
and
the
sobs
of
the
other
but
as
he
was
speaking
walloon
i
did
not
understand
what
he
said
go
to
bed
said
i
to
le
duc
and
next
morning
tell
the
landlord
to
get
me
another
room
for
a
wooden
partition
is
too
thin
a
barrier
to
keep
off
people
whom
despair
drive
to
extremities
i
went
to
bed
myself
and
the
sobs
and
muttering
did
not
die
away
till
midnight
i
was
shaving
next
morning
when
le
duc
announced
the
chevalier
stuard
say
i
do
know
anybody
of
that
name
he
executed
my
orders
and
returned
saying
that
the
chevalier
on
hearing
my
refusal
to
see
him
had
stamped
with
rage
gone
into
his
chamber
and
come
out
again
with
his
sword
beside
him
i
am
going
to
see
added
le
duc
that
your
pistols
are
well
primed
for
the
future
i
felt
inclined
to
laugh
but
none
the
less
i
admired
the
foresight
of
my
spaniard
for
a
man
in
despair
is
capable
of
anything
go
said
i
and
ask
the
landlord
to
give
me
another
room
in
due
course
the
landlord
came
himself
and
told
me
that
he
could
not
oblige
me
until
the
next
day
if
you
do
get
me
another
room
i
shall
leave
your
house
on
the
spot
because
i
do
like
hearing
sobs
and
reproaches
all
night
can
you
hear
them
sir
you
can
hear
them
yourself
now
what
do
you
think
of
it
the
woman
will
kill
herself
and
you
will
be
the
cause
of
her
death
i
sir
i
have
only
asked
them
to
pay
me
my
just
debts
hush
there
goes
the
husband
i
am
sure
he
is
telling
his
wife
in
his
language
that
you
are
an
unfeeling
monster
he
may
tell
her
what
he
likes
so
long
as
he
pays
me
you
have
condemned
them
to
die
of
hunger
how
much
do
they
owe
you
fifty
francs
are
you
ashamed
of
making
such
a
row
for
a
wretched
sum
like
that
sir
i
am
only
ashamed
of
an
ill
deed
and
i
do
not
commit
such
a
deed
in
asking
for
my
own
there
your
money
go
and
tell
them
that
you
have
been
paid
and
that
they
may
eat
again
but
do
say
who
gave
you
the
money
that
what
i
call
a
good
action
said
the
fellow
and
he
went
and
told
them
that
they
did
not
owe
him
anything
but
that
they
would
never
know
who
paid
the
money
you
may
dine
and
sup
he
added
at
the
public
table
but
you
must
pay
me
day
by
day
after
he
had
delivered
this
speech
in
a
high
voice
so
that
i
could
hear
as
well
as
if
i
had
been
in
the
room
he
came
back
to
me
you
stupid
fool
said
i
pushing
him
away
they
will
know
everything
so
saying
i
shut
my
door
le
duc
stood
in
front
of
me
staring
stupidly
before
him
what
the
matter
with
you
idiot
said
i
that
fine
i
see
i
am
going
on
the
stage
you
would
do
well
to
become
an
actor
you
are
a
fool
not
so
big
a
fool
as
you
think
i
am
going
for
a
walk
mind
you
do
leave
my
room
for
a
moment
i
had
scarcely
shut
the
door
when
the
chevalier
accosted
me
and
overwhelmed
me
with
thanks
sir
i
do
know
to
what
you
are
referring
he
thanked
me
again
and
left
me
and
walking
by
the
banks
of
the
rhone
which
geographers
say
is
the
most
rapid
river
in
europe
i
amused
myself
by
looking
at
the
ancient
bridge
at
i
went
back
to
the
inn
and
as
the
landlord
knew
that
i
paid
six
francs
a
meal
he
treated
me
to
an
exquisite
repast
here
i
remember
i
had
some
exceedingly
choice
hermitage
it
was
so
delicious
that
i
drank
nothing
else
i
wished
to
make
a
pilgrimage
to
vaucluse
and
begged
the
landlord
to
procure
me
a
good
guide
and
after
i
had
dressed
i
went
to
the
theatre
i
found
the
astrodi
at
the
door
and
giving
her
my
sixteen
tickets
i
sat
down
near
the
box
of
the
salviati
who
came
in
a
little
later
surrounded
by
a
numerous
train
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
bedizened
with
orders
and
gold
lace
the
father
of
the
false
astrodi
came
and
whispered
that
his
daughter
begged
me
to
say
that
she
was
the
celebrated
astrodi
i
had
known
at
paris
i
replied
also
in
a
whisper
that
i
would
not
run
the
risk
of
being
posted
as
a
liar
by
bolstering
up
an
imposture
the
ease
with
which
a
rogue
invites
a
gentleman
to
share
in
a
knavery
is
astonishing
he
must
think
his
confidence
confers
an
honour
at
the
end
of
the
first
act
a
score
of
lackeys
in
the
prince
livery
took
round
ices
to
the
front
boxes
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
refuse
a
young
gentleman
as
fair
as
love
came
up
to
me
and
with
easy
politeness
asked
me
why
i
had
refused
an
ice
not
having
the
honour
to
know
anyone
here
i
did
not
care
that
anyone
should
be
able
to
say
that
he
had
regaled
one
who
was
unknown
to
him
but
you
sir
are
a
man
who
needs
no
introduction
you
do
me
too
much
honour
you
are
staying
at
the
omer
yes
i
am
only
stopping
here
to
see
vaucluse
where
i
think
of
going
if
i
can
get
a
good
guide
if
you
would
do
me
the
honour
of
accepting
me
i
should
be
delighted
my
name
is
dolci
i
am
son
of
the
captain
of
the
guard
i
feel
the
honour
you
do
me
and
i
accept
your
obliging
offer
i
will
put
off
my
start
till
your
arrival
i
will
be
with
you
at
seven
i
was
astonished
at
the
easy
grace
of
this
young
adonis
who
might
have
been
a
pretty
girl
if
the
tone
of
his
voice
had
not
announced
his
manhood
i
laughed
at
the
false
astrodi
whose
acting
was
as
poor
as
her
face
and
who
kept
staring
at
me
all
the
time
while
she
sang
she
regarded
me
with
a
smile
and
gave
me
signs
of
an
understanding
which
must
have
made
the
audience
notice
me
and
doubtless
pity
my
bad
taste
the
voice
and
eyes
of
one
actress
pleased
me
she
was
young
and
tall
but
hunchbacked
to
an
extraordinary
degree
she
was
tall
in
spite
of
her
enormous
humps
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
malformation
she
would
have
been
six
feet
high
besides
her
pleasing
eyes
and
very
tolerable
voice
i
fancied
that
like
all
hunchbacks
she
was
intelligent
i
found
her
at
the
door
with
the
ugly
astrodi
when
i
was
leaving
the
theatre
the
latter
was
waiting
to
thank
me
and
the
other
was
selling
tickets
for
her
benefit
after
the
astrodi
had
thanked
me
the
hunchbacked
girl
turned
towards
me
and
with
a
smile
that
stretched
from
ear
to
ear
and
displayed
at
least
exquisite
teeth
she
said
that
she
hoped
i
would
honour
her
by
being
present
at
her
benefit
if
i
do
leave
before
it
comes
off
i
will
i
replied
at
this
the
impudent
astrodi
laughed
and
in
the
hearing
of
several
ladies
waiting
for
their
carriages
told
me
that
her
friend
might
be
sure
of
my
presence
as
she
would
not
let
me
go
before
the
benefit
night
give
him
sixteen
tickets
she
added
i
was
ashamed
to
refuse
and
gave
her
two
louis
then
in
a
lower
voice
the
astrodi
said
after
the
show
we
will
come
and
sup
with
you
but
on
the
condition
that
you
ask
nobody
else
as
we
want
to
be
alone
in
spite
of
a
feeling
of
anger
i
thought
that
such
a
would
be
amusing
and
as
no
one
in
the
town
knew
me
i
resolved
to
stay
in
the
hope
of
enjoying
a
hearty
laugh
i
was
having
my
supper
when
stuard
and
his
wife
went
to
their
room
this
night
i
heard
no
sobs
nor
reproaches
but
early
next
morning
i
was
surprised
to
see
the
chevalier
who
said
as
if
we
had
been
old
friends
that
he
had
heard
that
i
was
going
to
vaucluse
and
that
as
i
had
taken
a
carriage
with
four
places
he
would
be
much
obliged
if
i
would
allow
him
and
his
wife
who
wanted
to
see
the
fountain
to
go
with
me
i
consented
le
duc
begged
to
be
allowed
to
accompany
me
on
horseback
saying
that
he
had
been
a
true
prophet
in
fact
it
seemed
as
if
the
couple
had
agreed
to
repay
me
for
my
expenditure
by
giving
me
new
hopes
i
was
not
displeased
with
the
expedition
and
it
was
all
to
my
advantage
as
i
had
had
recourse
to
no
stratagems
to
obtain
it
dolci
came
looking
as
handsome
as
an
angel
my
neighbours
were
ready
and
the
carriage
loaded
with
the
best
provisions
in
food
and
drink
that
were
obtainable
and
we
set
off
dolci
seated
beside
the
lady
and
i
beside
the
chevalier
i
had
thought
that
the
lady
sadness
would
give
place
if
not
to
gaiety
at
least
to
a
quiet
cheerfulness
but
i
was
mistaken
for
to
all
my
remarks
grave
or
gay
she
replied
either
in
monosyllables
or
in
a
severely
laconic
style
poor
dolci
who
was
full
of
wit
was
stupefied
he
thought
himself
the
cause
of
her
melancholy
and
was
angry
with
himself
for
having
innocently
cast
a
shadow
on
the
party
of
pleasure
i
relieved
him
of
his
fears
by
telling
him
that
when
he
offered
me
his
pleasant
society
i
was
not
aware
that
i
was
to
be
of
service
to
the
fair
lady
i
added
that
when
at
i
received
this
information
i
was
pleased
that
he
would
have
such
good
company
the
lady
did
not
say
a
word
she
kept
silent
and
gloomy
all
the
time
and
gazed
to
right
and
left
like
one
who
does
not
see
what
is
before
his
her
eyes
dolci
felt
at
ease
after
my
explanation
and
did
his
best
to
arouse
the
lady
but
without
success
he
talked
on
a
variety
of
topics
to
the
husband
always
giving
her
an
opportunity
of
joining
in
but
her
lips
remained
motionless
she
looked
like
the
statue
of
pandora
before
it
had
been
quickened
by
the
divine
flame
the
beauty
of
her
face
was
perfect
her
eyes
were
of
a
brilliant
blue
her
complexion
a
delicate
mixture
of
white
and
red
her
arms
were
as
rounded
as
a
grace
her
hands
plump
and
well
shaped
her
figure
was
that
of
a
nymph
giving
delightful
hints
of
a
magnificent
breast
her
hair
was
a
chestnut
brown
her
foot
small
she
had
all
that
constitutes
a
beautiful
woman
save
that
gift
of
intellect
which
makes
beauty
more
beautiful
and
gives
a
charm
to
ugliness
itself
my
vagrant
fancy
shewed
me
her
naked
form
all
seemed
ravishing
and
yet
i
thought
that
though
she
might
inspire
a
passing
fancy
she
could
not
arouse
a
durable
affection
she
might
minister
to
a
man
pleasures
she
could
not
make
him
happy
i
arrived
at
the
isle
resolved
to
trouble
myself
about
her
no
more
she
might
i
thought
be
mad
or
in
despair
at
finding
herself
in
the
power
of
a
man
whom
she
could
not
possibly
love
i
could
not
help
pitying
her
and
yet
i
could
not
forgive
her
for
consenting
to
be
of
a
party
which
she
knew
she
must
spoil
by
her
morose
behaviour
as
for
the
chevalier
stuard
i
did
not
trouble
my
head
whether
he
were
her
husband
or
her
lover
he
was
young
he
spoke
affectedly
his
manners
were
not
good
and
his
conversation
betrayed
both
ignorance
and
stupidity
he
was
a
beggar
devoid
of
money
and
wits
and
i
could
not
make
out
why
he
took
with
him
a
beauty
who
unless
she
were
could
add
nothing
to
his
means
of
living
perhaps
he
expected
to
live
at
the
expense
of
simpletons
and
had
come
to
the
conclusion
in
spite
of
his
ignorance
that
the
world
is
full
of
such
however
experience
must
have
taught
him
that
this
plan
can
not
be
relied
on
when
we
got
to
vaucluse
i
let
dolci
lead
he
had
been
there
a
hundred
times
and
his
merit
was
enhanced
in
my
eyes
by
the
fact
that
he
was
a
lover
of
the
lover
of
laura
we
left
the
carriage
at
apt
and
wended
our
way
to
the
fountain
which
was
honoured
that
day
with
a
numerous
throng
of
pilgrims
the
stream
pours
forth
from
a
vast
cavern
the
handiwork
of
nature
inimitable
by
man
it
is
situated
at
the
foot
of
a
rock
with
a
sheer
descent
of
more
than
a
hundred
feet
the
cavern
is
hardly
half
as
high
and
the
water
pours
forth
from
it
in
such
abundance
that
it
deserves
the
name
of
river
at
its
source
it
is
the
sorgue
which
falls
into
the
rhone
near
avignon
there
is
no
other
stream
as
pure
and
clear
for
the
rocks
over
which
it
flows
harbour
no
deposits
of
any
kind
those
who
dislike
it
on
account
of
its
apparent
blackness
should
remember
that
the
extreme
darkness
of
the
cavern
gives
it
that
gloomy
tinge
chiare
fresche
a
dolce
aque
ove
le
belle
membra
pose
colei
the
sola
a
me
pay
donna
i
wished
to
ascend
to
that
part
of
the
rock
where
petrarch
house
stood
i
gazed
on
the
remains
with
tears
in
my
eyes
like
leo
allatius
at
homer
grave
sixteen
years
later
i
slept
at
arqua
where
petrarch
died
and
his
house
still
remains
the
likeness
between
the
two
situations
was
astonishing
for
from
petrarch
study
at
arqua
a
rock
can
be
seen
similar
to
that
which
may
be
viewed
at
vaucluse
this
was
the
residence
of
madonna
laura
let
us
go
there
said
i
it
is
not
far
off
i
will
not
endeavour
to
delineate
my
feelings
as
i
contemplated
the
ruins
of
the
house
where
dwelt
the
lady
whom
the
amorous
petrarch
immortalised
in
his
verse
verse
made
to
move
a
heart
of
stone
morte
bella
parea
nel
suo
bel
viso
i
threw
myself
with
arms
outstretched
upon
the
ground
as
if
i
would
embrace
the
very
stones
i
kissed
them
i
watered
them
with
my
tears
i
strove
to
breathe
the
holy
breath
they
once
contained
i
begged
madame
stuard
pardon
for
having
left
her
arm
to
do
homage
to
the
spirit
of
a
woman
who
had
quickened
the
profoundest
soul
that
ever
lived
i
say
soul
advisedly
for
after
all
the
body
and
the
senses
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
connection
four
hundred
years
have
past
and
gone
said
i
to
the
statue
of
a
woman
who
gazed
at
me
in
astonishment
since
laura
de
sade
walked
here
perhaps
she
was
not
as
handsome
as
you
but
she
was
lively
kindly
polite
and
good
of
heart
may
this
air
which
she
breathed
and
which
you
breathe
now
kindle
in
you
the
spark
of
fire
divine
that
fire
that
coursed
through
her
veins
and
made
her
heart
beat
and
her
bosom
swell
then
you
would
win
the
worship
of
all
worthy
men
and
from
none
would
you
receive
the
least
offence
gladness
madam
is
the
lot
of
the
happy
and
sadness
the
portion
of
souls
condemned
to
everlasting
pains
be
cheerful
then
and
you
will
do
something
to
deserve
your
beauty
the
worthy
dolci
was
kindled
by
my
enthusiasm
he
threw
himself
upon
me
and
kissed
me
again
and
again
the
fool
stuard
laughed
and
his
wife
who
possibly
thought
me
mad
did
not
evince
the
slightest
emotion
she
took
my
arm
and
we
walked
slowly
towards
the
house
of
messer
francesco
where
i
spent
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
cutting
my
name
after
that
we
had
our
dinner
dolci
lavished
more
attention
on
the
extraordinary
woman
than
i
did
stuard
did
nothing
but
eat
and
drink
and
despised
the
sorgue
water
which
said
he
would
spoil
the
hermitage
possibly
petrarch
may
have
been
of
the
same
opinion
we
drank
deeply
without
impairing
our
reason
but
the
lady
was
very
temperate
when
we
reached
avignon
we
bade
her
farewell
declining
the
invitation
of
her
foolish
husband
to
come
and
rest
in
his
rooms
i
took
dolci
arm
and
we
walked
beside
the
rhone
as
the
sun
went
down
among
other
keen
and
witty
observations
the
young
man
said
that
woman
is
an
old
hand
infatuated
with
a
sense
of
her
own
merit
i
would
bet
that
she
has
only
left
her
own
country
because
her
charms
from
being
too
freely
displayed
have
ceased
to
please
there
she
must
be
sure
of
making
her
fortune
out
of
anybody
she
comes
across
i
suspect
that
the
fellow
who
passes
for
her
husband
is
a
rascal
and
that
her
pretended
melancholy
is
put
on
to
drive
a
persistent
lover
to
distraction
she
has
not
yet
succeeded
in
finding
a
dupe
but
as
she
will
no
doubt
try
to
catch
a
rich
man
it
is
not
improbable
that
she
is
hovering
over
when
a
young
man
of
dolci
age
reasons
like
that
he
is
bound
to
become
a
great
master
i
kissed
him
as
i
bade
him
thanked
him
for
his
kindness
and
we
agreed
that
we
would
see
more
of
one
another
as
i
came
back
to
my
inn
i
was
accosted
by
a
man
of
middle
age
who
greeted
me
by
name
and
asked
with
great
politeness
if
i
had
found
vaucluse
as
fine
as
i
had
expected
i
was
delighted
to
recognize
the
marquis
of
grimaldi
a
genoese
a
clever
and
man
with
plenty
of
money
who
always
lived
at
venice
because
he
was
more
at
liberty
to
enjoy
himself
there
than
in
his
native
country
which
shews
that
there
is
no
lack
of
freedom
at
venice
after
i
had
answered
his
question
i
followed
him
into
his
room
where
having
exhausted
the
subject
of
the
fountain
he
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
my
fair
companion
i
did
not
find
her
satisfactory
in
all
respects
i
answered
and
noticing
the
reserve
with
which
i
spoke
he
tried
to
remove
it
by
the
following
confession
there
are
some
very
pretty
women
in
genoa
but
not
one
to
compare
with
her
whom
you
took
to
vaucluse
i
sat
opposite
to
her
at
table
yesterday
evening
and
i
was
struck
with
her
perfect
beauty
i
offered
her
my
arm
up
the
stair
i
told
her
that
i
was
sorry
to
see
her
so
sad
and
if
i
could
do
anything
for
her
she
had
only
to
speak
you
know
i
was
aware
she
had
no
money
her
husband
real
or
pretended
thanked
me
for
my
offer
and
after
i
had
wished
them
a
good
night
i
left
them
an
hour
ago
you
left
her
and
her
husband
at
the
door
of
their
apartment
and
soon
afterwards
i
took
the
liberty
of
calling
she
welcomed
me
with
a
pretty
bow
and
her
husband
went
out
directly
begging
me
to
keep
her
company
till
his
return
the
fair
one
made
no
difficulty
in
sitting
next
to
me
on
a
couch
and
this
struck
me
as
a
good
omen
but
when
i
took
her
hand
she
gently
drew
it
away
i
then
told
her
in
as
few
words
as
i
could
that
her
beauty
had
made
me
in
love
with
her
and
that
if
she
wanted
a
hundred
louis
they
were
at
her
service
if
she
would
drop
her
melancholy
and
behave
in
a
manner
suitable
to
the
feelings
with
which
she
had
inspired
me
she
only
replied
by
a
motion
of
the
head
which
shewed
gratitude
but
also
an
absolute
refusal
of
my
offer
am
going
said
i
no
answer
i
took
her
hand
again
and
she
drew
it
back
with
an
air
of
disdain
which
wounded
me
i
begged
her
to
excuse
me
and
i
left
the
room
without
more
ado
that
an
account
of
what
happened
an
hour
ago
i
am
not
amorous
of
her
it
was
only
a
whim
but
knowing
as
i
do
that
she
has
no
money
her
manner
astonished
me
i
fancied
that
you
might
have
placed
her
in
a
position
to
despise
my
offer
and
this
would
explain
her
conduct
in
a
measure
otherwise
i
ca
understand
it
at
all
may
i
ask
you
to
tell
me
whether
you
are
more
fortunate
than
i
i
was
enchanted
with
the
frankness
of
this
noble
gentleman
and
did
not
hesitate
to
tell
him
all
and
we
laughed
together
at
our
bad
fortune
i
had
to
promise
to
call
on
him
at
genoa
and
tell
him
whatever
happened
between
us
during
the
two
days
i
purposed
to
remain
at
avignon
he
asked
me
to
sup
with
him
and
admire
the
fair
recalcitrant
she
has
had
an
excellent
dinner
said
i
and
in
all
probability
she
will
not
have
any
supper
i
bet
she
will
said
the
marquis
and
he
was
right
which
made
me
see
clearly
that
the
woman
was
playing
a
part
a
certain
comte
de
bussi
who
had
just
come
was
placed
next
to
her
at
table
he
was
a
young
man
with
a
fatuous
sense
of
his
own
superiority
and
he
afforded
us
an
amusing
scene
he
was
a
wit
and
inclined
to
broad
jokes
and
his
manner
towards
women
bordered
on
the
impudent
he
had
to
leave
at
midnight
and
began
to
make
love
to
his
fair
neighbour
forthwith
and
teased
her
in
a
thousand
ways
but
she
remained
as
dumb
as
a
statue
while
he
did
all
the
talking
and
laughing
not
regarding
it
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
she
might
be
laughing
at
him
i
looked
at
grimaldi
who
found
it
as
difficult
to
keep
his
countenance
as
i
did
the
young
roue
was
hurt
at
her
silence
and
continued
pestering
her
giving
her
all
the
best
pieces
on
his
plate
after
tasting
them
first
the
lady
refused
to
take
them
and
he
tried
to
put
them
into
her
mouth
while
she
repulsed
him
in
a
rage
he
saw
that
no
one
seemed
inclined
to
take
her
part
and
determined
to
continue
the
assault
and
taking
her
hand
he
kissed
it
again
and
again
she
tried
to
draw
it
away
and
as
she
rose
he
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
made
her
sit
down
on
his
knee
but
at
this
point
the
husband
took
her
arm
and
led
her
out
of
the
room
the
attacking
party
looked
rather
taken
aback
for
a
moment
as
he
followed
her
with
his
eyes
but
sat
down
again
and
began
to
eat
and
laugh
afresh
while
everybody
else
kept
a
profound
silence
he
then
turned
to
the
footman
behind
his
chair
and
asked
him
if
his
sword
was
upstairs
the
footman
said
no
and
then
the
fatuous
young
man
turned
to
an
abbe
who
sat
near
me
and
enquired
who
had
taken
away
his
mistress
it
was
her
husband
said
the
abbe
her
husband
oh
that
another
thing
husbands
do
fight
a
man
of
honour
always
apologises
to
them
with
that
he
got
up
went
upstairs
and
came
down
again
directly
saying
the
husband
a
fool
he
shut
the
door
in
my
face
and
told
me
to
satisfy
my
desires
somewhere
else
it
is
worth
the
trouble
of
stopping
but
i
wish
i
had
made
an
end
of
it
he
then
called
for
champagne
offered
it
vainly
to
everybody
bade
the
company
a
polite
farewell
and
went
upon
his
way
as
grimaldi
escorted
me
to
my
room
he
asked
me
what
i
had
thought
of
the
scene
we
had
just
witnessed
i
told
him
i
would
not
have
stirred
a
finger
even
if
he
had
turned
up
her
clothes
no
more
would
i
said
he
but
if
she
had
accepted
my
hundred
louis
it
would
have
been
different
i
am
curious
to
know
the
further
history
of
this
siren
and
i
rely
upon
you
to
tell
me
all
about
it
as
you
go
through
genoa
he
went
away
at
next
morning
when
i
got
up
i
received
a
note
from
the
false
astrodi
asking
me
if
i
expected
her
and
her
great
chum
to
supper
i
had
scarcely
replied
in
the
affirmative
when
the
sham
duke
of
courland
i
had
left
at
grenoble
appeared
on
the
scene
he
confessed
in
a
humble
voice
that
he
was
the
son
of
at
narva
that
his
buckles
were
valueless
and
that
he
had
come
to
beg
an
alms
of
me
i
gave
him
four
louis
and
he
asked
me
to
keep
his
secret
i
replied
that
if
anyone
asked
me
about
him
that
i
should
say
what
was
absolutely
true
that
i
knew
him
nothing
about
him
thank
you
i
am
now
going
to
marseilles
i
hope
you
will
have
a
prosperous
journey
later
on
my
readers
will
hear
how
i
found
him
at
genoa
it
is
a
good
thing
to
know
something
about
people
of
his
kind
of
whom
there
are
far
too
many
in
the
world
i
called
up
the
landlord
and
told
him
i
wanted
a
delicate
supper
for
three
in
my
own
room
he
told
me
that
i
should
have
it
and
then
said
i
have
just
had
a
row
with
the
chevalier
stuard
what
about
because
he
has
nothing
to
pay
me
with
and
i
am
going
to
turn
them
out
immediately
although
the
lady
is
in
bed
in
convulsions
which
are
suffocating
her
take
out
your
bill
in
her
charms
ah
i
do
care
for
that
sort
of
thing
i
am
getting
on
in
life
and
i
do
want
any
more
scenes
to
bring
discredit
on
my
house
go
and
tell
her
that
from
henceforth
she
and
her
husband
will
dine
and
sup
in
their
own
room
and
that
i
will
pay
for
them
as
long
as
i
remain
here
you
are
very
generous
sir
but
you
know
that
meals
in
a
private
room
are
charged
double
i
know
they
are
very
good
i
shuddered
at
the
idea
of
the
woman
being
turned
out
of
doors
without
any
resources
but
her
body
by
which
she
refused
to
profit
on
the
other
hand
i
could
not
condemn
the
who
like
his
fellows
was
not
troubled
with
much
gallantry
i
had
yielded
to
an
impulse
of
pity
without
any
hopes
of
advantage
for
myself
such
were
my
thoughts
when
stuard
came
to
thank
me
begging
me
to
come
and
see
his
wife
and
try
and
persuade
her
to
behave
in
a
different
manner
she
will
give
me
no
answers
and
you
know
that
that
sort
of
thing
is
rather
tedious
come
she
knows
what
you
have
done
for
her
she
will
talk
to
you
for
her
feelings
what
business
have
you
to
talk
about
feelings
after
what
happened
yesterday
evening
it
was
well
for
that
gentleman
that
he
went
away
at
midnight
otherwise
i
should
have
killed
him
this
morning
my
dear
sir
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
all
that
is
pure
braggadocio
yesterday
not
was
the
time
to
kill
him
or
to
throw
your
plate
at
his
head
at
all
events
we
will
now
go
and
see
your
wife
i
found
her
in
bed
her
face
to
the
wall
the
coverlet
right
up
to
her
chin
and
her
body
convulsed
with
sobs
i
tried
to
bring
her
to
reason
but
as
usual
got
no
reply
stuard
wanted
to
leave
me
but
i
told
him
that
if
he
went
out
i
would
go
too
as
i
could
do
nothing
to
console
her
as
he
might
know
after
her
refusing
the
marquis
of
grimaldi
hundred
louis
for
a
smile
and
her
hand
to
kiss
a
hundred
louis
cried
the
fellow
with
a
sturdy
oath
what
folly
we
might
have
been
at
home
at
liege
by
now
a
princess
allows
one
to
kiss
her
hand
for
nothing
and
she
a
hundred
louis
oh
damnable
his
exclamations
very
natural
under
the
circumstances
made
me
feel
inclined
to
laugh
the
poor
devil
swore
by
all
his
gods
and
i
was
about
to
leave
the
room
when
all
at
once
the
wretched
woman
was
seized
with
true
or
false
convulsions
with
one
hand
she
seized
a
and
sent
it
flying
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
with
the
other
she
tore
the
clothes
away
from
her
breast
stuard
tried
to
hold
her
but
her
disorder
increased
in
violence
and
the
coverlet
was
disarranged
to
such
a
degree
that
i
could
see
the
most
exquisite
naked
charms
imaginable
at
last
she
grew
calm
and
her
eyes
closed
as
if
exhausted
she
remained
in
the
most
voluptuous
position
that
desire
itself
could
have
invented
i
began
to
get
very
excited
how
was
i
to
look
on
such
beauties
without
desiring
to
possess
them
at
this
point
her
wretched
husband
left
the
room
saying
he
was
gone
to
fetch
some
water
i
saw
the
snare
and
my
prevented
my
being
caught
in
it
i
had
an
idea
that
the
whole
scene
had
been
arranged
with
the
intent
that
i
should
deliver
myself
up
to
brutal
pleasure
while
the
proud
and
foolish
woman
would
be
free
to
disavow
all
participation
in
the
fact
i
constrained
myself
and
gently
veiled
what
i
would
fain
have
revealed
in
all
its
naked
beauty
i
condemned
to
darkness
these
charms
which
this
monster
of
a
woman
only
wished
me
to
enjoy
that
i
might
be
debased
stuard
was
long
enough
gone
when
he
came
back
with
the
full
he
was
no
doubt
surprised
to
find
me
perfectly
calm
and
in
no
disorder
of
any
kind
and
a
few
minutes
afterwards
i
went
out
to
cool
myself
by
the
banks
of
the
rhone
i
walked
along
rapidly
feeling
enraged
with
myself
for
i
felt
that
the
woman
had
bewitched
me
in
vain
i
tried
to
bring
myself
to
reason
the
more
i
walked
the
more
excited
i
became
and
i
determined
that
after
what
i
had
seen
the
only
cure
for
my
disordered
fancy
was
enjoyment
brutal
or
not
i
saw
that
i
should
have
to
win
her
not
by
an
appeal
to
sentiment
but
by
hard
cash
without
caring
what
sacrifices
i
made
i
regretted
my
conduct
which
then
struck
me
in
the
light
of
false
delicacy
for
if
i
had
satisfied
my
desires
and
she
chose
to
turn
prude
i
might
have
laughed
her
to
scorn
and
my
position
would
have
been
unassailable
at
last
i
determined
on
telling
the
husband
that
i
would
give
him
louis
if
he
could
obtain
me
an
interview
in
which
i
could
satisfy
my
desires
full
of
this
idea
i
went
back
to
the
inn
and
had
my
dinner
in
my
own
room
without
troubling
to
enquire
after
her
le
duc
told
me
that
she
was
dining
in
her
room
too
and
that
the
landlord
had
told
the
company
that
she
would
not
take
her
meals
in
public
any
more
this
was
information
i
possessed
already
after
dinner
i
called
on
the
dolci
who
introduced
me
to
his
father
an
excellent
man
but
not
rich
enough
to
satisfy
his
son
desire
of
travelling
the
young
man
was
possessed
of
considerable
dexterity
and
performed
a
number
of
very
clever
conjuring
tricks
he
had
an
amiable
nature
and
seeing
that
i
was
curious
to
know
about
his
love
affairs
he
told
me
numerous
little
stories
which
shewed
me
that
he
was
at
that
happy
age
when
one
inexperience
is
one
sole
misfortune
there
was
a
rich
lady
for
whom
he
did
not
care
as
she
wanted
him
to
give
her
that
which
he
would
be
ashamed
to
give
save
for
love
and
there
was
a
girl
who
required
him
to
treat
her
with
respect
i
thought
i
could
give
him
a
piece
of
good
advice
so
i
told
him
to
grant
his
favours
to
the
rich
woman
and
to
fail
in
respect
now
and
again
to
the
girl
who
would
be
sure
to
scold
and
then
forgive
he
was
no
profligate
and
seemed
rather
inclined
to
become
a
protestant
he
amused
himself
innocently
with
his
friends
of
his
own
age
in
a
garden
near
avignon
and
a
sister
of
the
gardener
wife
was
kind
to
him
when
they
were
alone
in
the
evening
i
went
back
to
the
inn
and
i
had
not
long
to
wait
for
the
astrodi
and
the
lepi
so
the
hunchbacked
girl
was
named
but
when
i
saw
these
two
caricatures
of
women
i
felt
stupefied
i
had
expected
them
of
course
but
the
reality
confounded
me
the
astrodi
tried
to
counterbalance
her
ugliness
by
an
outrageous
freedom
of
manners
while
the
lepi
who
though
a
hunchback
was
very
talented
and
an
excellent
actress
was
sure
of
exciting
desire
by
the
rare
beauty
of
her
eyes
and
teeth
which
latter
challenged
admiration
from
her
enormous
mouth
by
their
regularity
and
whiteness
the
astrodi
rushed
up
to
me
and
gave
me
an
italian
embrace
to
which
willy
nilly
i
was
obliged
to
submit
the
quieter
lepi
offered
me
her
cheek
which
i
pretended
to
kiss
i
saw
that
the
astrodi
was
in
a
fair
way
to
become
intolerable
so
i
begged
her
to
moderate
her
transports
because
as
a
novice
at
these
parties
i
wanted
to
get
accustomed
to
them
by
degrees
she
promised
that
she
would
be
very
good
while
we
were
waiting
for
supper
i
asked
her
for
the
sake
of
something
to
say
whether
she
had
found
a
lover
at
avignon
only
the
auditor
she
replied
and
though
he
makes
me
his
pathic
he
is
and
generous
i
have
accustomed
myself
to
his
taste
easily
enough
though
i
should
have
thought
such
a
thing
impossible
a
year
ago
as
i
fancied
the
exercise
a
harmful
one
but
i
was
wrong
so
the
auditor
makes
a
boy
of
you
yes
my
sister
would
have
adored
him
as
that
sort
of
love
is
her
passion
but
your
sister
has
such
fine
haunches
so
have
i
look
here
feel
me
you
are
right
but
wait
a
bit
it
is
too
soon
for
that
kind
of
thing
yet
we
will
be
wanton
after
supper
i
think
you
are
wanton
now
said
the
lepi
why
why
ought
you
to
shew
your
person
like
that
my
dear
girl
you
will
be
shewing
yourself
soon
when
one
is
in
good
company
one
is
in
the
golden
age
i
wonder
at
your
telling
everyone
what
sort
of
a
connection
you
have
with
the
auditor
said
i
nonsense
i
do
tell
everyone
but
everyone
tells
me
and
congratulates
me
too
they
know
the
worthy
man
never
cared
for
women
and
it
would
be
absurd
to
deny
what
everybody
guesses
i
used
to
be
astonished
at
my
sister
but
the
best
plan
in
this
world
is
to
be
astonished
at
nothing
but
do
you
like
that
no
i
only
like
this
as
i
spoke
i
laid
hands
on
the
lepi
on
the
spot
where
one
usually
finds
what
i
called
this
but
the
astrodi
seeing
that
i
found
nothing
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
and
taking
my
hand
put
it
just
under
her
front
hump
where
at
last
i
found
what
i
wanted
the
reader
will
guess
my
surprise
the
poor
creature
too
ashamed
to
be
prudish
laughed
too
my
spirits
also
begin
to
rise
as
i
thought
of
the
pleasure
i
should
get
out
of
this
new
discovery
after
supper
have
you
never
had
a
lover
said
i
to
the
lepi
no
said
the
astrodi
she
is
still
a
maid
no
i
am
not
replied
the
lepi
in
some
confusion
i
had
a
lover
at
bordeaux
and
another
at
montpellier
yes
i
know
but
you
are
still
as
you
were
born
i
ca
deny
it
what
that
two
lovers
and
still
a
maid
i
do
understand
please
tell
me
about
it
for
i
have
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
before
i
satisfied
my
first
lover
which
happened
when
i
was
only
twelve
i
was
just
the
same
as
i
am
now
it
wonderful
and
what
did
he
say
when
he
saw
it
i
swore
that
he
was
my
first
and
he
believed
me
putting
it
down
to
the
peculiar
shape
of
my
body
he
was
a
man
of
spirit
but
did
he
hurt
you
not
a
bit
but
then
he
was
very
gentle
you
must
have
a
try
after
supper
said
the
astrodi
to
me
that
would
be
fine
fun
no
no
said
the
lepi
the
gentleman
would
be
too
big
for
me
nonsense
you
do
want
to
take
in
all
of
him
i
will
show
you
how
it
is
with
these
words
the
impudent
hussy
proceeded
to
exhibit
me
and
i
let
her
do
what
she
liked
that
just
what
i
should
have
thought
cried
the
lepi
it
could
never
be
done
well
he
is
rather
big
answered
the
astrodi
but
there
a
cure
for
everything
and
he
will
be
content
with
it
not
the
length
my
dear
but
the
thickness
which
frightens
me
i
am
afraid
the
door
is
too
narrow
all
the
better
for
you
for
you
can
sell
your
maidenhead
after
having
had
two
lovers
this
conversation
not
devoid
of
wit
and
still
more
the
simplicity
of
the
hunchback
had
made
me
resolve
to
verify
things
for
myself
supper
came
up
and
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
two
nymphs
eat
like
starving
savages
and
drink
still
better
when
the
hermitage
had
done
its
work
the
astrodi
proposed
that
we
should
cast
off
the
clothes
which
disfigure
nature
certainly
said
i
and
i
will
turn
away
while
you
are
getting
ready
i
went
behind
the
curtains
took
off
my
clothes
and
went
to
bed
with
my
back
to
them
at
last
the
astrodi
told
me
that
they
were
ready
and
when
i
looked
the
lepi
took
up
all
my
attention
in
spite
of
her
double
deformity
she
was
a
handsome
woman
my
glances
frightened
her
for
she
was
doubtless
taking
part
in
an
orgy
for
the
first
time
i
gave
her
courage
however
by
dint
of
praising
those
charms
which
the
white
and
beautiful
hands
could
not
hide
and
at
last
i
persuaded
her
to
come
and
lie
beside
me
her
hump
prevented
her
lying
on
her
back
but
the
ingenious
astrodi
doubled
up
the
pillows
and
succeeded
in
placing
her
in
a
position
similar
to
that
of
a
ship
about
to
be
launched
it
was
also
by
the
tender
care
of
the
astrodi
that
the
introduction
of
the
knife
was
managed
to
the
great
delight
of
priest
and
victim
after
the
operation
was
over
she
got
up
and
kissed
me
which
she
could
not
do
before
for
her
mouth
reached
to
the
middle
of
my
chest
while
my
feet
were
scarcely
down
to
her
knees
i
would
have
given
ten
louis
to
have
been
able
to
see
the
curious
sight
we
must
have
presented
at
work
now
comes
my
turn
said
the
astrodi
but
i
do
want
you
to
infringe
on
the
rights
of
my
auditor
so
come
and
look
round
and
see
where
the
path
lies
take
that
what
am
i
to
do
with
this
slice
of
lemon
i
want
you
to
try
whether
the
place
is
free
from
infection
or
whether
it
would
be
dangerous
for
you
to
pay
it
a
visit
is
that
a
sure
method
infallible
if
everything
were
not
right
i
could
not
bear
the
smart
there
you
are
how
that
all
right
but
do
deceive
me
i
want
no
half
measures
my
reputation
would
be
made
if
i
became
with
child
i
ask
my
reader
leave
to
draw
a
veil
over
some
incidents
of
this
truly
scandalous
orgy
in
which
the
ugly
woman
taught
me
some
things
i
did
not
know
before
at
last
more
tired
than
exhausted
i
told
them
to
begone
but
the
astrodi
insisted
on
finishing
up
with
a
bowl
of
punch
i
agreed
but
not
wishing
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
either
of
them
i
dressed
myself
again
however
the
champagne
punch
excited
them
to
such
an
extent
that
at
last
they
made
me
share
their
transports
the
astrodi
placed
her
friend
in
such
a
singular
position
that
the
humps
were
no
longer
visible
and
imagining
that
i
had
before
me
the
high
priestess
of
jove
i
paid
her
a
long
sacrifice
in
which
death
and
resurrection
followed
one
another
in
succession
but
i
felt
disgusted
with
myself
and
drew
away
from
their
lascivious
frenzies
and
gave
them
ten
louis
to
get
rid
of
them
the
astrodi
fell
on
her
knees
blessed
me
thanked
me
called
me
her
god
and
the
lepi
wept
and
laughed
for
joy
at
the
same
time
and
thus
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
was
treated
to
a
scene
of
an
extraordinary
kind
i
had
them
taken
home
in
my
carriage
and
slept
till
ten
next
morning
just
as
i
was
going
out
for
a
walk
stuard
came
to
my
room
and
told
me
with
an
air
of
despair
that
if
i
did
not
give
him
the
means
of
going
away
before
i
left
he
would
throw
himself
in
the
rhine
that
rather
tragic
said
i
but
i
can
find
a
cure
i
will
disburse
louis
but
it
is
your
wife
who
must
receive
them
and
the
only
condition
is
that
she
must
receive
me
alone
for
an
hour
and
be
entirely
kind
sir
we
need
just
that
sum
my
wife
is
disposed
to
receive
you
go
and
talk
to
her
i
shall
not
be
in
till
noon
i
put
louis
in
a
pretty
little
purse
and
left
my
room
thinking
that
the
victory
was
won
i
entered
her
room
and
approached
her
bed
respectfully
when
she
heard
me
she
sat
up
in
bed
without
taking
the
trouble
to
cover
her
breast
and
before
i
could
wish
her
she
spoke
to
me
as
follows
i
am
ready
sir
to
pay
with
my
body
for
the
wretched
louis
of
which
my
husband
is
in
need
you
can
do
what
you
like
with
me
but
remember
that
in
taking
advantage
of
my
position
to
assuage
your
brutal
lust
you
are
the
viler
of
the
two
for
i
only
sell
myself
so
cheaply
because
necessity
compels
me
to
do
so
your
baseness
is
more
shameful
than
mine
come
on
here
i
am
with
this
flattering
address
she
threw
off
the
coverlet
with
a
vigorous
gesture
and
displayed
all
her
beauties
which
i
might
have
gazed
on
with
such
different
feelings
from
those
which
now
filled
my
breast
for
a
moment
i
was
silent
with
indignation
all
my
passion
had
evaporated
in
those
voluptuous
rounded
limbs
i
saw
now
only
the
covering
of
a
wild
beast
soul
i
put
back
the
coverlet
with
the
greatest
calmness
and
addressed
her
in
a
tone
of
cold
contempt
no
madam
i
shall
not
leave
this
room
degraded
because
you
have
told
me
so
but
i
shall
leave
it
after
imparting
to
you
a
few
degrading
truths
of
which
you
can
not
be
ignorant
if
you
are
a
woman
of
any
decency
whatever
here
are
louis
a
wretched
sum
to
give
a
virtuous
woman
in
payment
of
her
favours
but
much
more
than
you
deserve
i
am
not
brutal
and
to
convince
you
of
the
fact
i
am
going
to
leave
you
in
the
undisturbed
possession
of
your
charms
which
i
despise
as
heartily
as
i
should
have
admired
them
if
your
behaviour
had
been
different
i
only
give
you
the
money
from
a
feeling
of
compassion
which
i
can
not
overcome
and
which
is
the
only
feeling
i
now
have
for
you
nevertheless
let
me
tell
you
that
whether
a
woman
sells
herself
for
louis
or
million
louis
she
is
as
much
a
prostitute
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
if
she
does
not
give
her
love
with
herself
or
at
all
events
the
semblance
of
love
farewell
i
went
back
to
my
room
and
in
course
of
time
stuard
came
to
thank
me
sir
said
i
let
me
alone
i
wish
to
hear
no
more
about
your
wife
they
went
away
the
next
day
for
lyons
and
my
readers
will
hear
of
them
again
at
liege
in
the
afternoon
dolci
took
me
to
his
garden
that
i
might
see
the
gardener
sister
she
was
pretty
but
not
so
pretty
as
he
was
he
soon
got
her
into
a
good
humour
and
after
some
trifling
objection
she
consented
to
be
loved
by
him
in
my
presence
i
saw
that
this
adonis
had
been
richly
dowered
by
nature
and
i
told
him
that
with
such
a
physical
conformation
he
had
no
need
of
emptying
his
father
purse
to
travel
and
before
long
he
took
my
advice
this
fair
ganymede
might
easily
have
turned
me
into
jove
as
he
struggled
amorously
with
the
sister
as
i
was
going
home
i
saw
a
young
man
coming
out
of
a
boat
he
was
from
twenty
to
years
old
and
looked
very
sad
seeing
me
looking
at
him
he
accosted
me
and
humbly
asked
for
alms
shewing
me
a
document
authorizing
him
to
beg
and
a
passport
stating
he
had
left
madrid
six
weeks
before
he
came
from
parma
and
was
named
costa
when
i
saw
parma
my
national
prejudice
spoke
in
his
favour
and
i
asked
him
what
misfortune
had
reduced
him
to
beggary
only
lack
of
money
to
return
to
my
native
country
said
he
what
were
you
doing
at
madrid
and
why
did
you
leave
i
was
there
four
years
as
valet
to
pistoria
physician
to
the
king
of
spain
but
on
my
health
failing
i
left
him
here
is
a
certificate
which
will
shew
you
that
i
gave
satisfaction
what
can
you
do
i
write
a
good
hand
i
can
assist
a
gentleman
as
his
secretary
and
i
intend
being
a
scribe
when
i
get
home
here
are
some
verses
i
copied
yesterday
you
write
well
but
can
you
write
correctly
without
a
book
i
can
write
from
dictation
in
french
latin
and
spanish
correctly
yes
sir
if
the
dictation
is
done
properly
for
it
is
the
business
of
the
one
who
dictates
to
see
that
everything
is
correct
i
saw
that
master
gaetan
costa
was
an
ignoramus
but
in
spite
of
that
i
took
him
to
my
room
and
told
le
duc
to
address
him
in
spanish
he
answered
well
enough
but
on
my
dictating
to
him
in
italian
and
french
i
found
he
had
not
the
remotest
ideas
on
orthography
but
you
ca
write
said
i
to
him
however
i
saw
he
was
mortified
at
this
and
i
consoled
him
by
saying
that
i
would
take
him
to
his
own
country
at
my
expense
he
kissed
my
hand
and
assured
me
that
i
should
find
a
faithful
servant
in
him
this
young
fellow
took
my
fancy
by
his
originality
he
had
probably
assumed
it
to
distinguish
himself
from
the
blockheads
amongst
whom
he
had
hitherto
lived
and
now
used
it
in
perfect
good
faith
with
everybody
he
thought
that
the
art
of
a
scribe
solely
consisted
in
possessing
a
good
hand
and
that
the
fairest
writer
would
be
the
best
scribe
he
said
as
much
while
he
was
examining
a
paper
i
had
written
and
as
my
writing
was
not
as
legible
as
his
he
tacitly
told
me
i
was
his
inferior
and
that
i
should
therefore
treat
him
with
some
degree
of
respect
i
laughed
at
this
fad
and
not
thinking
him
incorrigible
i
took
him
into
my
service
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
odd
notion
of
his
i
should
probably
have
merely
given
him
a
louis
and
no
more
he
said
that
spelling
was
of
no
consequence
as
those
who
knew
how
to
spell
could
easily
guess
the
words
while
those
who
did
not
know
were
unable
to
pick
out
the
mistakes
i
laughed
but
as
i
said
nothing
he
thought
the
laugh
signified
approval
in
the
dictation
i
gave
him
the
council
of
trent
happened
to
occur
according
to
his
system
he
wrote
trent
by
a
three
and
a
nought
i
burst
out
laughing
but
he
was
not
in
the
least
put
out
only
remarking
that
the
pronunciation
being
the
same
it
was
of
no
consequence
how
the
word
was
spelt
in
point
of
fact
this
lad
was
a
fool
solely
through
his
intelligence
matched
with
ignorance
and
unbounded
i
was
pleased
with
his
originality
and
kept
him
and
was
thus
the
greater
fool
of
the
two
as
the
reader
will
see
i
left
avignon
next
day
and
went
straight
to
marseilles
not
troubling
to
stop
at
aix
i
halted
at
the
treize
cantons
wishing
to
stay
for
a
week
at
least
in
this
ancient
colony
of
the
phocaeans
and
to
do
as
i
liked
there
with
this
idea
i
took
no
letter
of
introduction
i
had
plenty
of
money
and
needed
nobody
help
i
told
my
landlord
to
give
me
a
choice
fish
dinner
in
my
own
room
as
i
was
aware
that
the
fish
in
those
parts
is
better
than
anywhere
else
i
went
out
the
next
morning
with
a
guide
to
take
me
back
to
the
inn
when
i
was
tired
of
walking
not
heeding
where
i
went
i
reached
a
fine
quay
i
thought
i
was
at
venice
again
and
i
felt
my
bosom
swell
so
deeply
is
the
love
of
fatherland
graven
on
the
heart
of
every
good
man
i
saw
a
number
of
stalls
where
spanish
and
levantine
wines
were
kept
and
a
number
of
people
drinking
in
them
a
crowd
of
business
men
went
hither
and
thither
running
up
against
each
other
crossing
each
other
paths
each
occupied
with
his
own
business
and
not
caring
whose
way
he
got
into
hucksters
well
dressed
and
ill
dressed
women
pretty
and
plain
women
who
stared
boldly
at
everyone
modest
maidens
with
downcast
eyes
such
was
the
picture
i
saw
the
mixture
of
nationalities
the
grave
turk
and
the
glittering
andalusian
the
french
dandy
the
gross
negro
the
crafty
greek
the
dull
hollander
everything
reminded
me
of
venice
and
i
enjoyed
the
scene
i
stopped
a
moment
at
a
street
corner
to
read
a
playbill
and
then
i
went
back
to
the
inn
and
refreshed
my
weary
body
with
a
delicious
dinner
washed
down
with
choice
syracusan
wine
after
dinner
i
dressed
and
took
a
place
in
the
amphitheatre
of
the
theatre
chapter
iii
rosalie
toulon
nice
i
arrive
at
genoa
grimaldi
veronique
and
her
sister
i
noticed
that
the
four
principal
boxes
on
both
sides
of
the
proscenium
were
adorned
with
pretty
women
but
not
a
single
gentleman
in
the
interval
between
the
first
and
second
acts
i
saw
gentlemen
of
all
classes
paying
their
devoirs
to
these
ladies
suddenly
i
heard
a
knight
of
malta
say
to
a
girl
who
was
the
sole
occupant
of
a
box
next
to
me
i
will
breakfast
with
you
this
was
enough
for
me
i
looked
at
her
more
closely
and
finding
her
to
be
a
dainty
morsel
i
said
as
soon
as
the
knight
had
gone
will
you
give
me
my
supper
with
pleasure
but
i
have
been
taken
in
so
often
that
i
sha
expect
you
without
an
earnest
how
can
i
give
you
an
earnest
i
do
understand
you
must
be
a
here
just
arrived
she
laughed
called
the
knight
and
said
be
pleased
to
explain
to
this
gentleman
who
has
just
asked
me
for
supper
the
meaning
of
the
word
the
knight
explained
with
a
smile
that
the
lady
fearing
lest
my
memory
should
prove
defective
wanted
me
to
pay
for
my
supper
in
advance
i
thanked
him
and
asked
her
if
a
louis
would
be
enough
and
on
her
replying
in
the
affirmative
i
gave
her
the
louis
and
asked
for
her
address
the
knight
told
me
politely
that
he
would
take
me
there
himself
after
the
theatre
adding
she
the
wantonest
wench
in
all
marseilles
he
then
asked
me
if
i
knew
the
town
and
when
i
told
him
that
i
had
only
come
that
day
he
said
he
was
glad
to
be
the
first
to
make
my
acquaintance
we
went
to
the
middle
of
the
amphitheatre
and
he
pointed
out
a
score
of
girls
to
right
and
left
all
of
them
ready
to
treat
the
first
comer
to
supper
they
are
all
on
the
free
list
and
the
manager
finds
they
serve
his
ends
as
respectable
women
will
not
sit
in
their
boxes
and
they
draw
people
to
the
theatre
i
noticed
five
or
six
of
a
better
type
than
the
one
i
had
engaged
but
i
resolved
to
stick
to
her
for
the
evening
and
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
others
another
time
is
your
favourite
amongst
them
i
said
to
the
knight
no
i
keep
a
and
i
will
introduce
you
to
her
as
i
am
glad
to
say
that
i
am
free
from
all
jealousy
when
the
play
came
to
an
end
he
took
me
to
my
nymph
lodging
and
we
parted
with
the
understanding
that
we
were
to
see
more
of
one
another
i
found
the
lady
in
undress
a
circumstance
which
went
against
her
for
what
i
saw
did
not
please
me
she
gave
me
a
capital
supper
and
enlivened
me
by
some
witty
and
wanton
sallies
which
made
me
regard
her
in
a
more
favourable
light
when
we
had
supper
she
got
into
bed
and
asked
me
to
follow
her
example
but
i
told
her
that
i
never
slept
out
she
then
offered
me
the
english
article
which
brings
peace
to
the
soul
but
i
did
not
accept
the
one
she
offered
as
i
thought
it
looked
of
a
common
make
i
have
finer
ones
but
they
are
three
francs
each
and
the
maker
only
sells
them
by
the
dozen
she
said
i
will
take
a
dozen
if
they
are
really
good
i
replied
she
rang
the
bell
and
a
young
charming
and
girl
came
in
i
was
struck
with
her
you
have
got
a
nice
maid
i
remarked
when
the
girl
had
gone
for
the
protective
sheaths
she
is
only
fifteen
she
said
and
wo
do
anything
as
she
is
new
to
it
will
you
allow
me
to
see
for
myself
you
may
ask
her
if
you
like
but
i
do
think
she
will
consent
the
girl
came
back
with
the
packet
and
putting
myself
in
a
proper
position
i
told
her
to
try
one
on
she
proceeded
to
do
so
with
a
sulky
air
and
with
a
kind
of
repugnance
which
made
me
feel
interested
in
her
number
one
would
not
go
on
so
she
had
to
try
on
a
second
and
the
result
was
that
i
besprinkled
her
plentifully
the
mistress
laughed
but
she
was
indignant
threw
the
whole
packet
in
my
face
and
ran
away
in
a
rage
i
wanted
nothing
more
after
this
so
i
put
the
packet
in
my
pocket
gave
the
woman
two
louis
and
left
the
room
the
girl
i
had
treated
so
cavalierly
came
to
light
me
downstairs
and
thinking
i
owed
her
an
apology
i
gave
her
a
louis
and
begged
her
pardon
the
poor
girl
was
astonished
kissed
my
hand
and
begged
me
to
say
nothing
to
her
mistress
i
will
not
my
dear
but
tell
me
truly
whether
you
are
still
a
intacta
certainly
sir
wonderful
but
tell
me
why
you
would
let
me
see
for
myself
because
it
revolted
me
nevertheless
you
will
have
to
do
so
for
otherwise
in
spite
of
your
prettiness
people
will
not
know
what
to
make
of
you
would
you
like
to
let
me
try
yes
but
not
in
this
horrible
house
where
then
go
to
my
mother
i
will
be
there
your
guide
knows
where
she
lives
when
i
got
outside
i
asked
the
man
if
he
knew
her
he
replied
in
the
affirmative
and
said
he
believed
her
to
be
an
honest
girl
you
will
take
me
to
see
her
mother
i
said
next
morning
he
took
me
to
the
end
of
the
town
to
a
poor
house
where
i
found
a
poor
woman
and
poor
children
living
on
the
ground
floor
and
eating
hard
black
bread
what
do
you
want
said
she
is
you
daughter
here
no
and
what
if
she
were
i
am
not
her
bawd
no
of
course
not
my
good
woman
just
then
the
girl
came
in
and
the
enraged
mother
flung
an
old
pot
which
came
handy
at
her
head
luckily
it
missed
but
she
would
not
have
escaped
her
mother
talons
if
i
had
not
flung
myself
between
them
however
the
old
woman
set
up
a
dismal
shriek
the
children
imitated
her
and
the
poor
girl
began
to
cry
this
hubbub
made
my
man
come
in
you
hussy
screamed
the
mother
you
are
bringing
disgrace
on
me
get
out
of
my
house
you
are
no
longer
my
daughter
i
was
in
a
difficult
position
the
man
begged
her
not
to
make
such
a
noise
as
it
would
draw
all
the
neighbours
about
the
house
but
the
enraged
woman
answered
only
by
abuse
i
drew
six
francs
from
my
pocket
and
gave
them
to
her
but
she
flung
them
in
my
face
at
last
i
went
out
with
the
daughter
whose
hair
she
attempted
to
pull
out
by
the
roots
which
project
was
defeated
by
the
aid
of
my
man
as
soon
as
we
got
outside
the
mob
which
the
uproar
had
attracted
hooted
me
and
followed
me
and
no
doubt
i
should
have
been
torn
to
pieces
if
i
had
not
escaped
into
a
church
which
i
left
by
another
door
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
my
fright
saved
me
for
i
knew
the
ferocity
of
the
provencals
and
i
took
care
not
to
reply
a
word
to
the
storm
of
abuse
which
poured
on
me
i
believe
that
i
was
never
in
greater
danger
than
on
that
day
before
i
got
back
to
my
inn
i
was
rejoined
by
the
servant
and
the
girl
how
could
you
lead
me
into
such
a
dangerous
position
said
i
you
must
have
known
your
mother
was
savage
i
hoped
she
would
behave
respectfully
to
you
be
calm
do
weep
any
more
tell
me
how
i
can
serve
you
rather
than
return
to
that
horrible
house
i
was
in
yesterday
i
would
throw
myself
into
the
sea
do
you
know
of
any
respectable
house
where
i
can
keep
her
said
i
to
the
man
he
told
me
he
did
know
a
respectable
individual
who
let
furnished
apartments
take
me
to
it
then
the
man
was
of
an
advanced
age
and
he
had
rooms
to
let
on
all
the
floors
i
only
want
a
little
nook
said
the
girl
and
the
old
man
took
us
to
the
highest
story
and
opened
the
door
of
a
garret
saying
this
closet
is
six
francs
a
month
a
month
rent
to
be
paid
in
advance
and
i
may
tell
you
that
my
door
is
always
shut
at
ten
and
that
nobody
can
come
and
pass
the
night
with
you
the
room
held
a
bed
with
coarse
sheets
two
chairs
a
little
table
and
a
chest
of
drawers
how
much
will
you
board
this
young
woman
for
said
i
he
asked
twenty
sous
and
two
sous
for
the
maid
who
would
bring
her
meals
and
do
her
room
that
will
do
said
the
girl
and
she
paid
the
month
rent
and
the
day
board
i
left
her
telling
her
i
would
come
back
again
as
i
went
down
the
stairs
i
asked
the
old
man
to
shew
me
a
room
for
myself
he
skewed
me
a
very
nice
one
at
a
louis
a
month
and
i
paid
in
advance
he
then
gave
me
a
that
i
might
go
and
come
when
i
liked
if
you
wish
to
board
here
said
he
i
think
i
could
give
satisfaction
having
done
this
good
work
i
had
my
dinner
by
myself
and
then
went
to
a
where
i
found
the
amiable
knight
of
malta
who
was
playing
he
left
the
game
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
put
the
fistfull
of
gold
he
had
won
into
his
pocket
accosted
me
with
the
politeness
natural
to
a
frenchman
and
asked
me
how
i
had
liked
the
lady
who
had
given
me
my
supper
i
told
him
what
had
happened
at
which
he
laughed
and
asked
me
to
come
and
see
his
we
found
her
under
the
hands
and
she
received
me
with
the
playful
familiarity
with
which
one
greets
an
old
acquaintance
i
did
not
think
much
of
her
but
i
pretended
to
be
immensely
struck
with
the
idea
of
pleasing
the
knight
when
the
hairdresser
left
her
it
was
time
for
her
to
get
ready
for
the
theatre
and
she
dressed
herself
without
caring
who
was
present
the
knight
helped
her
to
change
her
chemise
which
she
allowed
him
to
do
as
a
matter
of
course
though
indeed
she
begged
me
to
excuse
her
as
i
owed
her
a
compliment
i
could
think
of
nothing
better
than
to
tell
her
that
though
she
had
not
offended
me
she
had
made
me
feel
very
uncomfortable
i
do
believe
you
said
she
it
true
all
the
same
she
came
up
to
me
to
verify
the
fact
and
finding
i
had
deceived
her
she
said
half
crossly
you
are
a
bad
fellow
the
women
of
marseilles
are
undoubtedly
the
most
profligate
in
france
they
not
only
pride
themselves
on
never
refusing
but
also
on
being
the
first
to
propose
this
girl
skewed
me
a
repeater
for
which
she
had
got
up
a
lottery
at
twelve
francs
a
ticket
she
had
ten
tickets
left
i
took
them
all
and
so
delighted
was
she
to
touch
my
five
louis
that
she
came
and
kissed
me
and
told
the
knight
that
her
unfaithfulness
to
him
rested
only
with
me
i
am
charmed
to
hear
it
said
the
maltese
he
asked
me
to
sup
with
her
and
i
accepted
the
invitation
but
the
sole
pleasure
i
had
was
looking
at
the
knight
at
work
he
was
far
inferior
to
dolci
i
wished
them
good
night
and
went
to
the
house
where
i
had
placed
the
poor
girl
the
maid
skewed
me
to
my
room
and
i
asked
her
if
i
might
go
to
the
garret
she
took
the
light
i
followed
her
up
and
rosalie
as
the
poor
girl
was
named
heard
my
voice
and
opened
the
door
i
told
the
maid
to
wait
for
me
in
my
room
and
i
went
in
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
are
you
contented
dear
i
said
i
am
quite
happy
then
i
hope
you
will
be
kind
and
find
room
for
me
in
your
bed
you
may
come
if
you
like
but
i
must
tell
you
that
you
will
not
find
me
a
maid
as
i
have
had
one
lover
you
told
me
a
lie
then
forgive
me
i
could
not
guess
you
would
be
my
lover
i
forgive
you
willingly
all
the
more
so
as
i
am
no
great
stickler
for
maidenheads
she
was
as
gentle
as
a
lamb
and
allowed
me
to
gaze
on
all
those
charms
of
which
my
hands
and
my
lips
disputed
the
possession
and
the
notion
that
i
was
master
of
all
these
treasures
put
fire
in
all
my
veins
but
her
submissive
air
distressed
me
how
is
it
you
do
not
partake
my
desires
said
i
i
dare
not
lest
you
take
me
for
a
pretender
artifice
or
studied
coquetry
might
have
prompted
such
an
answer
but
the
real
timidity
and
the
frankness
with
which
these
words
were
uttered
could
not
have
been
assumed
impatient
to
gain
possession
of
her
i
took
off
my
clothes
and
on
getting
into
bed
to
her
i
was
astonished
to
find
her
a
maid
why
did
you
tell
me
you
had
a
lover
said
i
i
never
heard
of
a
girl
telling
a
lie
of
that
sort
before
all
the
same
i
did
not
tell
a
lie
but
i
am
very
glad
that
i
seem
as
if
i
had
done
so
tell
me
all
about
it
certainly
i
will
for
i
want
to
win
your
confidence
this
is
the
story
two
years
ago
my
mother
though
she
was
still
loved
me
i
was
a
and
earned
from
twenty
to
thirty
sous
a
day
whatever
i
earned
i
gave
my
mother
i
had
never
had
a
lover
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
and
when
my
goodness
was
praised
i
felt
inclined
to
laugh
i
had
been
brought
up
from
a
child
never
to
look
at
young
men
when
i
met
them
in
the
street
and
never
to
reply
to
them
when
they
addressed
any
impudence
to
me
two
months
ago
a
fine
enough
looking
young
man
a
native
of
genoa
and
a
merchant
in
a
small
way
came
to
my
mother
to
get
her
to
wash
some
very
fine
cotton
stockings
which
the
had
stained
when
he
saw
me
he
was
very
complimentary
but
in
an
honest
way
i
liked
him
and
no
doubt
seeing
it
he
came
and
came
again
every
evening
my
mother
was
always
present
at
our
interviews
and
he
looked
at
me
and
talked
to
me
but
did
not
so
much
as
ask
to
kiss
my
hand
my
mother
was
very
pleased
to
notice
that
the
young
man
liked
me
and
often
scolded
me
because
i
was
not
polite
enough
to
him
in
time
he
had
to
go
to
genoa
in
a
small
ship
which
belonged
to
him
and
which
was
laden
with
goods
he
assured
us
that
he
would
return
again
the
next
spring
and
declare
his
intentions
he
said
he
hoped
he
should
find
me
as
good
as
ever
and
still
without
any
lover
this
was
enough
my
mother
looked
upon
him
as
my
betrothed
and
let
us
talk
together
at
the
door
till
midnight
when
he
went
i
would
shut
the
door
and
lie
down
beside
my
mother
who
was
always
asleep
four
or
five
days
before
his
departure
he
took
my
arm
and
got
me
to
go
with
him
to
a
place
about
fifty
paces
from
the
house
to
drink
a
glass
of
muscat
at
a
greek
who
kept
his
tavern
open
all
night
we
were
only
away
for
half
an
hour
and
then
it
was
that
he
first
kissed
me
when
i
got
home
i
found
my
mother
awake
and
told
her
all
it
seemed
so
harmless
to
me
next
day
excited
by
the
recollection
of
what
had
happened
the
night
before
i
went
with
him
again
and
love
began
to
gain
ground
we
indulged
in
caresses
which
were
no
longer
innocent
as
we
well
knew
however
we
forgave
each
other
as
we
had
abstained
from
the
chief
liberty
the
day
after
my
lover
as
he
had
to
journey
in
the
night
took
leave
of
my
mother
and
as
soon
as
she
was
in
bed
i
was
not
longer
in
granting
what
i
desired
as
much
as
he
we
went
to
the
greek
ate
and
drank
and
our
heated
senses
gained
love
cause
we
forgot
our
duty
and
fancied
our
misdemeanour
a
triumph
afterwards
we
fell
asleep
and
when
we
awoke
we
saw
our
fault
in
the
clear
cold
light
of
day
we
parted
sorrowful
rather
than
rejoicing
and
the
reception
my
mother
gave
me
was
like
that
you
witnessed
this
morning
i
assured
her
that
marriage
would
take
away
the
shame
of
my
sin
and
with
this
she
took
up
a
stick
and
would
have
done
for
me
if
i
had
not
taken
to
my
heels
more
from
instinct
than
from
any
idea
of
what
i
was
doing
once
in
the
street
i
knew
not
where
to
turn
and
taking
refuge
in
a
church
i
stayed
there
like
one
in
a
dream
till
noon
think
of
my
position
i
was
hungry
i
had
no
refuge
nothing
but
the
clothes
i
wore
nothing
that
would
get
me
a
morsel
of
bread
a
woman
accosted
me
in
the
street
i
knew
her
and
i
also
knew
that
she
kept
a
servants
agency
i
asked
her
forthwith
if
she
could
get
me
a
place
had
enquiries
about
a
maid
this
morning
said
she
it
is
for
a
gay
woman
and
you
are
pretty
you
would
have
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
in
remaining
virtuous
can
keep
off
the
infection
i
answered
in
the
position
i
am
in
i
can
not
pick
and
choose
she
thereupon
took
me
to
the
lady
who
was
delighted
to
see
me
and
still
more
delighted
when
i
told
her
that
i
had
never
had
anything
to
do
with
a
man
i
have
repented
of
this
lie
bitterly
enough
for
in
the
week
i
spent
at
that
profligate
woman
house
i
have
had
to
endure
the
most
humiliating
insults
that
an
honest
girl
ever
suffered
no
sooner
did
the
men
who
came
to
the
house
hear
that
i
was
a
maid
than
they
longed
to
slake
their
brutal
lust
upon
me
offering
me
gold
if
i
would
submit
to
their
caresses
i
refused
and
was
reviled
but
that
was
not
all
five
or
six
times
every
day
i
was
obliged
to
remain
a
witness
of
the
disgusting
scenes
enacted
between
my
mistress
and
her
customers
who
when
i
was
compelled
to
light
them
about
the
house
at
night
overwhelmed
me
with
insults
because
i
would
not
do
them
a
disgusting
service
for
a
piece
i
could
not
bear
this
sort
of
life
much
longer
and
i
was
thinking
of
drowning
myself
when
you
came
you
treated
me
so
ignominiously
that
my
resolve
to
die
was
strengthened
but
you
were
so
kind
and
polite
as
you
went
away
that
i
fell
in
love
with
you
directly
thinking
that
providence
must
have
sent
you
to
snatch
me
away
from
the
abyss
i
thought
your
fine
presence
might
calm
my
mother
and
persuade
her
to
take
me
back
till
my
lover
came
to
marry
me
i
was
undeceived
and
i
saw
that
she
took
me
for
a
prostitute
now
if
you
like
i
am
altogether
yours
and
i
renounce
my
lover
of
whom
i
am
no
longer
worthy
take
me
as
your
maid
i
will
love
you
and
you
only
i
will
submit
myself
to
you
and
do
whatever
you
bid
me
whether
it
were
weakness
or
virtue
on
my
part
this
tale
of
woe
and
a
mother
too
great
severity
drew
tears
from
my
eyes
and
when
she
saw
my
emotion
she
wept
profusely
for
her
heart
was
in
need
of
some
relief
i
think
my
poor
rosalie
you
have
only
one
chemise
alas
that
is
all
comfort
yourself
my
dear
all
your
wants
shall
be
supplied
tomorrow
and
in
the
evening
you
shall
sup
with
me
in
my
room
on
the
second
floor
i
will
take
care
of
you
you
pity
me
then
i
fancy
there
is
more
love
than
pity
in
it
would
to
god
it
were
so
this
would
to
god
which
came
from
the
very
depths
of
her
soul
sent
me
away
in
a
merry
mood
the
servant
who
had
been
waiting
for
me
for
two
hours
and
was
looking
rather
glum
relaxed
when
she
saw
the
colour
of
a
crown
which
i
gave
her
by
way
of
atonement
tell
your
master
said
i
that
rosalie
will
sup
with
me
let
us
have
a
fasting
dinner
but
let
it
be
a
good
one
i
returned
to
my
inn
quite
in
love
with
rosalie
and
i
congratulated
myself
on
having
at
last
heard
a
true
tale
from
a
pretty
mouth
she
appeared
to
me
so
well
disposed
that
her
small
failing
seemed
to
make
her
shine
the
more
i
resolved
never
to
abandon
her
and
i
did
so
in
all
sincerity
was
i
not
in
love
after
i
had
had
my
chocolate
next
morning
i
went
out
with
a
guide
to
the
shops
where
i
got
the
necessary
articles
paying
a
good
but
not
an
excessive
price
rosalie
was
only
fifteen
but
with
her
figure
her
breasts
and
her
rounded
arms
she
would
have
been
taken
for
twenty
her
shape
was
so
imprinted
on
my
brain
that
everything
i
got
for
her
fitted
as
if
she
had
been
measured
for
it
this
shopping
took
up
all
the
morning
and
in
the
afternoon
the
man
took
her
a
small
trunk
containing
two
dresses
chemises
petticoats
handkerchiefs
stockings
gloves
caps
a
pair
of
slippers
a
fan
a
and
a
mantle
i
was
pleased
at
giving
her
such
a
delightful
surprise
and
i
longed
for
suppertime
that
i
might
enjoy
the
sight
of
her
pleasure
the
knight
of
malta
came
to
dine
with
me
without
ceremony
and
i
was
charmed
to
see
him
after
we
had
dined
he
persuaded
me
to
go
to
the
theatre
as
in
consequence
of
the
suspense
of
the
subscription
arrangements
the
boxes
would
be
filled
with
all
the
quality
in
marseilles
there
will
be
no
loose
women
in
the
amphitheatre
said
he
as
everybody
has
to
pay
that
decided
me
and
i
went
he
presented
me
to
a
lady
with
an
excellent
connection
who
asked
me
to
come
and
see
her
i
excused
myself
on
the
plea
that
i
was
leaving
so
shortly
nevertheless
she
was
very
useful
to
me
on
my
second
visit
to
marseilles
her
name
was
madame
audibert
i
did
not
wait
for
the
play
to
end
but
went
where
love
called
me
i
had
a
delightful
surprise
when
i
saw
rosalie
i
should
not
have
known
her
but
i
can
not
resist
the
pleasure
of
recalling
her
picture
as
she
stood
before
me
then
despite
the
years
that
have
rolled
by
since
that
happy
moment
rosalie
was
an
brunette
above
the
middle
height
her
face
was
a
perfect
oval
and
exquisitely
proportioned
two
fine
black
eyes
shed
a
soft
and
ravishing
light
around
her
eyebrows
were
arched
and
she
had
a
wealth
of
hair
black
and
shining
as
ebony
her
skin
was
while
and
lightly
tinged
with
colour
on
her
chin
was
a
dimple
and
her
slightest
smile
summoned
into
being
two
other
dimples
one
on
each
cheek
her
mouth
was
small
disclosing
two
rows
of
fairest
orient
pearls
and
from
her
red
lips
flowed
forth
an
indefinable
sweetness
the
lower
lip
projected
ever
so
lightly
and
seemed
designed
to
hold
a
kiss
i
have
spoken
of
her
arms
her
breast
and
her
figure
which
left
nothing
to
be
desired
but
i
must
add
to
this
catalogue
of
her
charms
that
her
hand
was
exquisitely
shaped
and
that
her
foot
was
the
smallest
i
have
ever
seen
as
to
her
other
beauties
i
will
content
myself
with
saying
that
they
were
in
harmony
with
those
i
have
described
to
see
her
at
her
best
one
had
to
see
her
smiling
and
hitherto
she
had
been
sad
or
vexed
states
of
mind
which
detract
from
a
appearance
but
now
sadness
was
gone
and
gratitude
and
pleasure
had
taken
its
place
i
examined
her
closely
and
felt
proud
as
i
saw
what
a
transformation
i
had
effected
but
i
concealed
my
surprise
lest
she
should
think
i
had
formed
an
unfavourable
impression
of
her
i
proceeded
therefore
to
tell
her
that
i
should
expose
myself
to
ridicule
if
i
attempted
to
keep
a
beauty
like
herself
for
a
servant
you
shall
be
my
mistress
i
said
and
my
servants
shall
respect
you
as
if
you
were
my
wife
at
this
rosalie
as
if
i
had
given
her
another
being
began
to
try
and
express
her
gratitude
for
what
i
had
done
her
words
which
passion
made
confused
increased
my
joy
here
was
no
art
nor
deceit
but
simple
nature
there
was
no
mirror
in
her
garret
so
she
had
dressed
by
her
sense
of
touch
and
i
could
see
that
she
was
afraid
to
stand
up
and
look
at
herself
in
the
mirror
in
my
room
i
knew
the
weak
spot
in
all
hearts
which
men
are
very
wrong
in
considering
as
matter
for
reproach
and
i
encouraged
her
to
admire
herself
whereupon
she
could
not
restrain
a
smile
of
satisfaction
i
think
i
must
be
in
disguise
said
she
for
i
have
never
seen
myself
so
decked
out
before
she
praised
the
tasteful
simplicity
of
the
dress
i
had
chosen
but
was
vexed
at
the
thought
that
her
mother
would
still
be
displeased
think
no
more
of
your
mother
dearest
one
you
look
like
a
lady
of
quality
and
i
shall
be
quite
proud
when
the
people
at
genoa
ask
me
if
you
are
my
daughter
at
genoa
yes
at
genoa
why
do
you
blush
from
surprise
perhaps
i
may
see
there
one
whom
i
have
not
yet
forgotten
would
you
like
to
stay
here
better
no
no
love
me
and
be
sure
that
i
love
you
and
for
your
own
sake
not
from
any
thought
of
my
own
interests
you
are
moved
my
angel
let
me
wipe
away
your
tears
with
kisses
she
fell
into
my
arms
and
she
relieved
the
various
feelings
of
which
her
heart
was
full
by
weeping
for
some
time
i
did
not
try
to
console
her
for
she
had
not
grief
she
wept
as
tender
souls
and
women
more
especially
often
will
we
had
a
delicious
supper
to
which
i
did
honour
for
two
for
she
ate
nothing
i
asked
her
if
she
was
so
unfortunate
as
not
to
care
for
good
food
i
have
as
good
an
appetite
as
anyone
she
replied
and
an
excellent
digestion
you
shall
see
for
yourself
when
i
grow
more
accustomed
to
my
sudden
happiness
at
least
you
can
drink
this
wine
is
admirable
if
you
prefer
greek
muscat
i
will
send
for
some
it
will
remind
you
of
your
lover
if
you
love
me
at
all
i
beg
you
will
spare
me
that
mortification
you
shall
have
no
more
mortification
from
me
i
promise
you
it
was
only
a
joke
and
i
beg
your
pardon
for
it
as
i
look
upon
you
i
feel
in
despair
at
not
having
known
you
first
that
feeling
of
yours
which
wells
forth
from
the
depths
of
your
open
soul
is
grand
you
are
beautiful
and
good
for
you
only
yielded
to
the
voice
of
love
with
the
prospect
of
becoming
his
wife
and
when
i
think
what
you
are
to
me
i
am
in
despair
at
not
being
sure
you
love
me
an
evil
genius
whispers
in
my
ear
that
you
only
bear
with
me
because
i
had
the
happiness
of
helping
you
indeed
that
is
an
evil
genius
to
be
sure
if
i
had
met
you
in
the
street
i
should
not
have
fallen
head
over
ears
in
love
with
you
like
a
wanton
but
you
would
certainly
have
pleased
me
i
am
sure
i
love
you
and
not
for
what
you
have
done
for
me
for
if
i
were
rich
and
you
were
poor
i
would
do
anything
in
the
world
for
you
but
i
do
want
it
to
be
like
that
for
i
had
rather
be
your
debtor
than
for
you
to
be
mine
these
are
my
real
feelings
and
you
can
guess
the
rest
we
were
still
talking
on
the
same
subject
when
midnight
struck
and
my
old
landlord
came
and
asked
me
if
i
were
pleased
i
must
thank
you
i
replied
i
am
delighted
who
cooked
this
delicious
supper
my
daughter
she
understands
her
craft
tell
her
i
thought
it
excellent
yes
sir
but
it
is
dear
not
too
dear
for
me
you
shall
be
pleased
with
me
as
i
with
you
and
take
care
to
have
as
good
a
supper
evening
as
i
hope
the
lady
will
be
well
enough
to
do
justice
to
the
products
of
your
culinary
skill
bed
is
a
capital
place
to
get
an
appetite
ah
it
is
sixty
years
since
i
have
had
anything
to
do
with
that
sort
of
thing
what
are
you
laughing
at
mademoiselle
at
the
delight
with
which
you
must
recollect
it
you
are
right
it
is
a
pleasant
recollection
and
thus
i
am
always
ready
to
forgive
young
folks
the
peccadilloes
that
love
makes
them
commit
you
are
a
wise
old
man
said
i
everyone
should
sympathise
with
the
tenderest
of
all
our
mortal
follies
if
the
old
man
is
wise
said
rosalie
when
he
had
left
the
room
my
mother
must
be
very
foolish
would
you
like
me
to
take
you
to
the
play
pray
do
not
i
will
come
if
you
like
but
it
will
vex
me
very
much
i
do
want
to
walk
out
with
you
or
to
go
to
the
theatre
with
you
here
good
heavens
what
would
people
say
no
neither
at
marseilles
but
elsewhere
anything
you
please
and
with
all
my
heart
very
good
my
dear
just
as
you
please
but
look
at
your
room
no
more
garret
for
you
and
in
three
days
we
will
start
so
soon
yes
tell
me
what
you
require
for
the
journey
for
i
want
you
to
lack
for
anything
and
if
you
leave
it
all
to
me
i
might
forget
something
which
would
vex
me
well
i
should
like
another
cloak
a
cloak
with
a
lining
some
boots
a
and
a
you
know
how
to
read
do
you
certainly
and
i
can
write
fairly
well
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
your
asking
me
so
freely
for
what
you
want
is
a
true
proof
of
your
love
where
confidence
dwells
not
there
is
no
love
i
will
not
forget
anything
but
your
feet
are
so
small
that
i
should
advise
you
to
get
your
boots
yourself
our
talk
was
so
pleasant
and
i
experienced
such
delight
in
studying
her
disposition
that
we
did
not
go
to
bed
till
five
in
the
arms
of
love
and
sleep
we
spent
seven
delicious
hours
and
when
we
rose
at
noon
we
were
fast
lovers
she
called
me
thou
talked
of
love
and
not
of
gratitude
and
grown
more
familiar
with
her
new
estate
laughed
at
her
troubles
she
kissed
me
at
every
opportunity
called
me
her
darling
boy
her
joy
and
as
the
present
moment
is
the
only
real
thing
in
this
life
i
enjoyed
her
love
i
was
pleased
with
her
caresses
and
put
away
all
ideas
of
the
dreadful
future
which
has
only
one
certainty
death
linea
rerum
the
second
night
was
far
sweeter
than
the
first
she
had
made
a
good
supper
and
drunk
well
though
moderately
thus
she
was
disposed
to
refine
on
her
pleasure
and
to
deliver
herself
with
greater
ardour
to
all
the
voluptuous
enjoyments
which
love
inspires
i
gave
her
a
pretty
watch
and
a
gold
shuttle
for
her
to
amuse
herself
with
i
wanted
it
said
she
but
i
should
never
have
dared
to
ask
for
it
i
told
her
that
this
fear
of
my
displeasure
made
me
doubt
once
more
whether
she
really
loved
me
she
threw
herself
into
my
arms
and
promised
that
henceforth
she
would
shew
me
the
utmost
confidence
i
was
pleased
to
educate
this
young
girl
and
i
felt
that
when
her
mind
had
been
developed
she
would
be
perfect
on
the
fourth
day
i
warned
her
to
hold
herself
in
readiness
to
start
at
a
moment
notice
i
had
said
nothing
about
my
plans
to
costa
or
le
duc
but
rosalie
knew
that
i
had
two
servants
and
i
told
her
that
i
should
often
make
them
talk
on
the
journey
for
the
sake
of
the
laughter
their
folly
would
afford
me
you
my
dear
i
had
said
to
her
must
be
very
reserved
with
them
and
not
allow
them
to
take
the
slightest
liberty
give
them
your
orders
as
a
mistress
but
without
pride
and
you
will
be
obeyed
and
respected
if
they
forget
themselves
in
the
slightest
particular
tell
me
at
once
i
started
from
the
hotel
of
the
treize
cantons
with
four
le
duc
and
costa
sitting
on
the
coachman
seat
the
guide
whom
i
had
paid
well
for
his
services
took
us
to
rosalie
door
i
got
out
of
the
carriage
and
after
thanking
the
kindly
old
landlord
who
was
sorry
to
lose
so
good
a
boarder
i
made
her
get
in
sat
down
beside
her
and
ordered
the
postillions
to
go
to
toulon
as
i
wished
to
see
that
fine
port
before
returning
to
italy
we
got
to
toulon
at
five
my
rosalie
behaved
herself
at
supper
like
the
mistress
of
a
house
accustomed
to
the
best
society
i
noticed
that
le
duc
as
head
man
made
costa
wait
upon
her
but
i
got
over
him
by
telling
my
sweetheart
that
he
would
have
the
honour
of
doing
her
hair
as
he
could
do
it
as
well
as
the
best
barber
in
paris
he
swallowed
the
golden
pill
and
gave
in
with
a
good
grace
and
said
with
a
profound
bow
that
he
hoped
to
give
madam
satisfaction
we
went
out
next
morning
to
see
the
port
and
were
shewn
over
the
place
by
the
commandant
whose
acquaintance
we
made
by
a
lucky
chance
he
offered
his
arm
to
rosalie
and
treated
her
with
the
consideration
she
deserved
for
her
appearance
and
the
good
sense
of
her
questions
the
commandant
accepted
my
invitation
to
dinner
at
which
rosalie
spoke
to
the
point
though
not
to
excess
and
received
the
polite
compliments
of
our
worthy
guest
with
much
grace
in
the
afternoon
he
took
us
over
the
arsenal
and
after
having
him
to
dinner
could
not
refuse
his
invitation
to
supper
there
was
no
difficulty
about
rosalie
the
commandant
introduced
her
immediately
to
his
wife
his
daughter
and
his
son
i
was
delighted
to
see
that
her
manner
with
ladies
even
surpassed
her
manner
with
gentlemen
she
was
one
of
nature
own
ladies
the
commandant
wife
and
daughter
caressed
her
again
and
again
and
she
received
their
attentions
with
that
modest
sensibility
which
is
the
seal
of
a
good
education
they
asked
me
to
dinner
the
next
day
but
i
was
satisfied
with
what
i
had
seen
so
i
took
leave
intending
to
start
on
the
morrow
when
we
got
back
to
the
inn
i
told
her
how
pleased
i
was
with
her
and
she
threw
her
arms
round
my
neck
for
joy
i
am
always
afraid
said
she
of
being
asked
who
i
am
you
need
be
afraid
dearest
in
france
no
gentleman
or
lady
would
think
of
asking
such
a
question
but
if
they
did
what
ought
i
to
do
you
should
make
use
of
an
evasion
what
an
evasion
a
way
of
escaping
from
a
difficulty
without
satisfying
impertinent
curiosity
give
me
an
example
well
if
such
a
question
were
asked
you
you
might
say
had
better
ask
this
gentleman
i
see
the
question
is
avoided
but
is
not
that
impolite
yes
but
not
so
impolite
as
to
ask
an
embarrassing
question
and
what
would
you
say
if
the
question
was
passed
on
to
you
well
my
answer
would
vary
in
a
ratio
with
the
respect
in
which
i
held
the
questioner
i
would
not
tell
the
truth
but
i
should
say
something
and
i
am
glad
to
see
you
attentive
to
my
lessons
always
ask
questions
and
you
will
always
find
me
ready
to
answer
for
i
want
to
teach
you
and
now
let
us
to
bed
we
have
to
start
for
antibes
at
an
early
hour
and
love
will
reward
you
for
the
pleasure
you
have
given
me
at
antibes
i
hired
a
felucca
to
take
me
to
genoa
and
as
i
intended
to
return
by
the
same
route
i
had
my
carriage
warehoused
for
a
small
monthly
payment
we
started
early
with
a
good
wind
but
the
sea
becoming
rough
and
rosalie
being
mortally
afraid
i
had
the
felucca
rowed
into
villafranca
where
i
engaged
a
carriage
to
take
me
to
nice
the
weather
kept
us
back
for
three
days
and
i
felt
obliged
to
call
on
the
commandant
an
old
officer
named
peterson
he
gave
me
an
excellent
reception
and
after
the
usual
compliments
had
passed
said
do
you
know
a
russian
who
calls
himself
charles
ivanoff
i
saw
him
once
at
grenoble
it
is
said
that
he
has
escaped
from
siberia
and
that
he
is
the
younger
son
of
the
duke
of
courland
so
i
have
heard
but
i
know
no
proof
of
his
claim
to
the
title
he
is
at
genoa
where
it
is
said
a
banker
is
to
give
him
twenty
thousand
crowns
in
spite
of
that
no
one
would
give
him
a
sou
here
so
i
sent
him
to
genoa
at
my
own
expense
to
rid
the
place
of
him
i
felt
very
glad
that
the
russian
had
gone
away
before
my
arrival
an
officer
named
ramini
who
was
staying
at
the
same
inn
as
myself
asked
if
i
would
mind
taking
charge
of
a
packet
which
de
pierre
the
spanish
consul
had
to
send
to
the
marquis
grimaldi
at
genoa
it
was
the
nobleman
i
had
just
seen
at
avignon
and
i
was
pleased
to
execute
the
commission
the
same
officer
asked
me
whether
i
had
ever
seen
a
certain
madame
stuard
she
came
here
a
fortnight
ago
with
a
man
who
calls
himself
her
husband
the
poor
devils
had
a
penny
and
she
a
great
beauty
enchanted
everybody
but
would
give
no
one
a
smile
or
a
word
i
have
both
seen
and
know
her
i
answered
i
furnished
her
with
the
means
to
come
here
how
could
she
leave
nice
without
any
money
that
just
what
no
one
can
understand
she
went
off
in
a
carriage
and
the
landlord
bill
was
paid
i
was
interested
in
the
woman
the
marquis
grimaldi
told
me
that
she
had
refused
a
hundred
louis
he
offered
her
and
that
a
venetian
of
his
acquaintance
had
fared
just
as
badly
perhaps
that
is
you
it
is
and
i
gave
her
some
money
despite
my
treatment
peterson
came
to
see
me
and
was
enchanted
with
rosalie
amiable
manner
this
was
another
conquest
for
her
and
i
duly
complimented
her
upon
it
nice
is
a
terribly
dull
place
and
strangers
are
tormented
by
the
midges
who
prefer
them
to
the
inhabitants
however
i
amused
myself
at
a
small
bank
at
faro
which
was
held
at
a
and
at
which
rosalie
whose
play
i
directed
won
a
score
of
piedmontese
pistoles
she
put
her
little
earnings
into
a
purse
and
told
me
she
liked
to
have
some
money
of
her
own
i
scolded
her
for
not
having
told
me
so
before
and
reminded
her
of
her
promise
i
do
really
want
it
said
she
it
only
my
thoughtlessness
we
soon
made
up
our
little
quarrel
in
such
ways
did
i
make
this
girl
my
own
in
the
hope
that
for
the
remnant
of
my
days
she
would
be
mine
and
so
i
should
not
be
forced
to
fly
from
one
lady
to
another
but
inexorable
fate
ordained
it
otherwise
the
weather
grew
fine
again
and
we
got
on
board
once
more
and
the
next
day
arrived
at
genoa
which
i
had
never
seen
before
i
put
up
at
martin
inn
and
for
decency
sake
took
two
rooms
but
they
were
adjoining
one
another
the
following
day
i
sent
the
packet
to
grimaldi
and
a
little
later
i
left
my
card
at
his
palace
my
guide
took
me
to
a
and
i
bought
some
stuff
for
rosalie
who
was
in
want
of
linen
she
was
very
pleased
with
it
we
were
still
at
table
when
the
marquis
grimaldi
was
announced
he
kissed
me
and
thanked
me
for
bringing
the
parcel
his
next
remark
referred
to
madame
stuard
i
told
him
what
had
happened
and
he
laughed
saying
that
he
was
not
quite
sure
what
he
would
have
done
under
the
circumstances
i
saw
him
looking
at
rosalie
attentively
and
i
told
him
she
was
as
good
as
she
was
beautiful
i
want
to
find
her
a
maid
i
said
a
good
seamstress
who
could
go
out
with
her
and
above
all
who
could
talk
italian
to
her
for
i
want
her
to
learn
the
language
that
i
may
take
her
into
society
at
florence
rome
and
naples
do
deprive
genoa
of
the
pleasure
of
entertaining
her
said
the
marquis
i
will
introduce
her
under
whatever
name
she
pleases
and
in
my
own
house
to
begin
with
she
has
good
reasons
for
preserving
her
incognito
here
ah
i
see
do
you
think
of
staying
here
long
a
month
or
thereabouts
and
our
pleasures
will
be
limited
to
seeing
the
town
and
its
surroundings
and
going
to
the
theatre
we
shall
also
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
the
table
i
hope
to
eat
champignons
every
day
they
are
better
here
than
anywhere
else
an
excellent
plan
i
could
suggest
a
better
i
am
going
to
see
what
i
can
do
in
the
way
of
getting
you
a
maid
mademoiselle
you
sir
how
can
i
deserve
such
great
kindness
my
interest
in
you
is
the
greater
as
i
think
you
come
from
marseilles
rosalie
blushed
she
was
not
aware
that
she
lisped
and
that
this
betrayed
her
i
extricated
her
from
her
confusion
by
telling
the
marquis
his
conjecture
was
well
founded
i
asked
him
how
i
could
get
the
journal
de
savans
the
mercure
de
france
and
other
papers
of
the
same
description
he
promised
to
send
me
a
man
who
would
get
me
all
that
kind
of
thing
he
added
that
if
i
would
allow
him
to
send
me
some
of
his
excellent
chocolate
he
would
come
and
breakfast
with
us
i
said
that
both
gift
and
guest
were
vastly
agreeable
to
me
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
rosalie
asked
me
to
take
her
to
a
milliner
i
want
ribbons
and
other
little
things
said
she
but
i
should
like
to
bargain
for
them
and
pay
for
them
out
of
my
own
money
without
your
having
anything
to
do
with
it
do
whatever
you
like
my
dear
and
afterwards
we
will
go
to
the
play
the
milliner
to
whom
we
went
proved
to
be
a
frenchwoman
it
was
a
charming
sight
to
see
rosalie
shopping
she
put
on
an
important
air
seemed
to
know
all
about
it
ordered
bonnets
in
the
latest
fashion
bargained
and
contrived
to
spend
five
or
six
louis
with
great
grandeur
as
we
left
the
shop
i
told
her
that
i
had
been
taken
for
her
footman
and
i
meant
to
be
revenged
so
saying
i
made
her
come
into
a
jeweller
where
i
bought
her
a
necklace
and
brooches
in
imitation
diamonds
and
without
letting
her
say
a
word
i
paid
the
price
and
left
the
shop
you
have
bought
me
some
beautiful
things
said
she
but
you
are
too
lavish
with
your
money
if
you
had
bargained
you
might
have
saved
four
louis
at
least
very
likely
dearest
but
i
never
was
any
hand
at
a
bargain
i
took
her
to
the
play
but
as
she
did
not
understand
the
language
she
got
dreadfully
tired
and
asked
me
to
take
her
home
at
the
end
of
the
first
act
which
i
did
very
willingly
when
we
got
in
i
found
a
box
waiting
for
me
from
grimaldi
it
proved
to
contain
pounds
of
chocolate
costa
who
had
boasted
of
his
skill
in
making
chocolate
in
the
spanish
fashion
received
orders
to
make
us
three
cups
in
the
morning
at
nine
the
marquis
arrived
with
a
tradesman
who
sold
me
some
beautiful
oriental
materials
i
gave
them
to
rosalie
to
make
two
for
herself
the
is
a
kind
of
hooded
cloak
worn
by
the
genoese
women
as
the
is
worn
at
venice
and
the
at
madrid
i
thanked
grimaldi
for
the
chocolate
which
was
excellent
costa
was
quite
proud
of
the
praise
the
marquis
gave
him
le
duc
came
in
to
announce
a
woman
whose
name
i
did
not
know
it
the
mother
of
the
maid
i
have
engaged
said
grimaldi
she
came
in
and
i
saw
before
me
a
woman
followed
by
a
girl
from
twenty
to
years
old
who
pleased
me
at
the
first
glance
the
mother
thanked
the
marquis
and
presented
her
daughter
to
rosalie
enumerating
her
good
qualities
and
telling
her
that
she
would
serve
her
well
and
walk
with
her
when
she
wished
to
go
out
my
daughter
she
added
speaks
french
and
you
will
find
her
a
good
faithful
and
obliging
girl
she
ended
by
saying
that
her
daughter
had
been
in
service
lately
with
a
lady
and
that
she
would
be
obliged
if
she
could
have
her
meals
by
herself
the
girl
was
named
veronique
rosalie
told
her
that
she
was
a
good
girl
and
that
the
only
way
to
be
respected
was
to
be
respectable
veronique
kissed
her
hand
the
mother
went
away
and
rosalie
took
the
girl
into
her
room
to
begin
her
work
i
did
not
forget
to
thank
the
marquis
for
he
had
evidently
chosen
a
maid
more
with
a
view
to
my
likings
than
to
those
of
my
sweetheart
i
told
him
that
i
should
not
fail
to
call
on
him
and
he
replied
that
he
would
be
happy
to
see
me
at
any
hour
and
that
i
should
easily
find
him
at
his
casino
at
pierre
where
he
often
spent
the
night
