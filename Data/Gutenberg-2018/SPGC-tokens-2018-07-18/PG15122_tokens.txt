oh

has
forgotten
that
it
is
my
birthday
even
papa
jack
has
gone
off
to
town
without
saying
a
word
about
it
and
he
nevah
did
such
a
thing
befo
in
all
his
life
as
she
spoke
the
little
colonel
put
her
arm
around
her
pony
neck
and
for
a
moment
her
fair
little
head
was
pressed
disconsolately
against
its
velvety
black
mane
it
is
the
presents
i
care
about
she
whispered
choking
back
a
sob
but
oh
tarbaby
it
the
bein
forgotten
of
mothah
could
be
expected
to
remembah
she
been
so
ill
but
i
think
grandfathah
might
or
mom
beck
or
if
there
only
been
one
single
person
when
i
came
this
mawnin
to
say
wish
you
many
happy
returns
lloyd
deah
i
would
feel
so
bad
but
there
was
and
i
nevah
felt
so
and
lonesome
and
left
out
since
i
was
bawn
tarbaby
had
no
words
with
which
to
comfort
his
little
mistress
but
he
seemed
to
understand
that
she
was
in
trouble
and
rubbed
his
nose
lovingly
against
her
shoulder
the
mute
caress
comforted
her
as
much
as
words
could
have
done
and
presently
she
climbed
into
the
saddle
and
started
slowly
down
the
avenue
to
the
gate
it
was
a
warm
may
morning
sweet
with
the
fragrance
of
the
locusts
for
the
great
trees
arching
above
her
were
all
abloom
and
the
ground
beneath
was
snowy
with
the
petals
under
the
long
white
arch
she
rode
with
the
fallen
blossoms
white
at
her
feet
the
pewees
called
from
the
cedars
and
the
fat
robins
ran
across
the
lawn
just
as
they
had
done
the
spring
before
when
it
was
her
eleventh
birthday
and
she
had
ridden
along
that
same
way
singing
the
happiest
hearted
child
in
the
valley
but
she
was
not
singing
another
sob
came
up
in
her
throat
as
she
thought
of
the
difference
now
i
a
whole
yeah
oldah
she
sighed
oh
deah
i
do
want
to
grow
up
one
bit
and
i
be
suah
old
on
my
next
birthday
for
i
be
in
my
teens
then
i
wondah
how
that
will
feel
this
last
yeah
was
such
a
lovely
one
for
it
brought
the
house
pahty
and
so
many
holidays
but
this
yeah
has
begun
all
wrong
i
ca
help
feelin
that
it
goin
to
bring
me
lots
of
trouble
down
the
avenue
she
thought
she
heard
some
one
calling
her
and
stopped
to
look
back
but
no
one
was
in
sight
the
shutters
were
closed
in
her
mother
room
last
yeah
she
stood
at
the
window
and
waved
to
me
when
i
rode
away
sighed
the
child
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
again
now
she
so
white
and
ill
it
makes
me
cry
to
look
at
her
maybe
that
is
the
trouble
this
yeah
is
goin
to
bring
me
betty
mothah
died
and
eugenia
and
maybe
but
the
thought
was
too
dreadful
to
put
into
words
and
she
stopped
abruptly
mom
beck
was
right
she
whispered
with
a
nod
of
her
head
she
said
that
sad
thoughts
are
like
crows
they
come
in
flocks
i
wish
i
could
stop
thinkin
about
such
things
a
train
passed
as
she
cantered
through
the
gate
and
started
down
the
road
beside
the
railroad
track
she
drew
rein
to
watch
it
thunder
by
some
child
at
the
window
pointed
a
finger
at
her
and
then
two
smiling
little
faces
were
pressed
against
the
pane
for
an
eager
glimpse
it
was
the
prettiest
wayside
picture
the
passengers
had
seen
in
all
that
travel
the
little
colonel
on
her
pony
with
the
spray
of
locust
bloom
in
the
cockade
of
the
napoleon
cap
she
wore
and
a
plume
of
the
same
graceful
blossoms
nodding
jauntily
over
each
of
tarbaby
black
ears
as
the
admiring
faces
whirled
past
her
lloyd
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
i
glad
that
i
do
have
to
do
my
riding
in
a
smoky
old
car
this
may
mawnin
she
thought
it
is
wicked
for
me
to
be
so
unhappy
when
i
have
tarbaby
and
all
the
othah
things
that
mothah
and
papa
jack
have
given
me
i
know
perfectly
well
that
they
love
me
just
the
same
even
if
they
have
forgotten
my
birthday
and
i
wo
let
such
old
black
crow
thoughts
flock
down
on
me
i
ride
fast
and
get
away
from
them
that
was
harder
to
do
than
she
had
imagined
for
as
she
passed
judge
moore
place
the
deserted
house
added
to
her
feeling
of
loneliness
andy
the
old
gardener
was
cutting
the
grass
on
the
front
lawn
she
called
to
him
when
is
the
family
coming
out
from
town
andy
not
this
summer
miss
lloyd
he
answered
it
be
the
first
summer
in
twenty
years
that
the
judge
has
missed
he
has
taken
a
cottage
at
the
seaside
and
they
all
going
there
the
house
will
stay
closed
just
as
you
see
it
now
i
reckon
for
another
year
at
the
seashore
she
echoed
not
coming
out
she
almost
gasped
the
news
was
so
unexpected
here
was
another
disappointment
and
a
very
sore
one
every
summer
as
far
back
as
she
could
remember
rob
moore
had
been
her
favourite
playfellow
now
there
would
be
no
more
mad
tam
races
with
rob
clattering
along
beside
her
on
his
big
horse
no
more
good
times
with
the
best
and
jolliest
of
little
neighbours
a
summer
without
rob
cheery
whistle
and
laugh
would
seem
as
empty
and
queer
as
the
woods
without
the
bird
voices
or
the
meadows
without
the
whirr
of
humming
things
she
rode
slowly
on
there
was
no
letter
for
her
when
she
stopped
at
the
to
inquire
for
the
mail
the
girls
on
whom
she
called
afterward
were
not
at
home
so
she
rode
aimlessly
around
the
valley
until
nearly
wishing
for
once
that
it
were
a
it
was
the
longest
saturday
morning
she
had
ever
known
she
could
not
practise
her
music
lesson
for
fear
of
making
her
mother
headache
worse
she
could
not
go
near
the
kitchen
where
she
might
have
found
entertainment
for
aunt
cindy
was
in
one
of
her
black
tempers
and
scolded
shrilly
as
she
moved
around
among
her
shining
tins
there
was
no
one
to
show
her
how
to
begin
her
new
piece
of
embroidery
papa
jack
had
forgotten
to
bring
out
the
magazines
she
wanted
to
see
walker
had
failed
to
roll
the
and
put
up
the
net
so
she
could
not
even
practise
serving
the
balls
by
herself
when
came
it
was
so
lonely
eating
by
herself
in
the
big
that
she
hurried
through
the
meal
as
quickly
as
possible
and
tiptoed
up
the
stairs
to
the
door
of
her
mother
room
mom
beck
raised
her
finger
with
a
warning
sh
and
seeing
that
her
mother
was
still
asleep
lloyd
stole
away
to
her
own
room
her
own
pretty
pink
and
white
nest
and
curled
herself
up
among
the
cushions
in
a
big
easy
chair
by
the
window
it
was
the
first
time
in
her
memory
that
her
mother
had
been
for
more
than
a
week
she
had
not
been
able
to
leave
her
room
and
the
lonely
child
accustomed
to
being
with
her
constantly
crept
around
the
house
like
a
little
stray
kitten
the
place
scarcely
seemed
like
home
and
the
days
were
endless
some
unusual
feeling
of
sensitiveness
had
kept
her
from
reminding
the
family
of
her
birthday
other
years
she
had
openly
counted
the
days
for
weeks
beforehand
and
announced
the
gifts
that
she
would
be
most
pleased
to
receive
here
by
the
window
the
dismal
crow
thoughts
began
flocking
down
to
her
again
and
to
drive
them
away
she
picked
up
a
book
from
the
table
and
began
to
read
it
was
a
green
and
gold
volume
of
short
stories
one
that
she
had
read
many
times
before
but
she
never
grew
tired
of
them
the
one
she
liked
best
was
marguerite
and
she
turned
to
that
first
because
it
was
the
story
of
a
happy
birthday
marguerite
was
a
little
german
girl
learning
to
knit
and
to
help
her
in
her
task
her
family
wound
for
her
a
mammoth
ball
of
yarn
as
full
of
surprise
packages
as
a
plum
cake
is
of
plums
day
by
day
as
her
patient
knitting
unwound
the
yarn
some
gift
dropped
out
into
her
lap
they
were
simple
things
nearly
all
of
them
a
knife
a
ribbon
a
thimble
a
pencil
and
here
and
there
a
bonbon
but
they
were
magnified
by
the
charm
of
the
surprise
and
they
turned
the
tedious
task
into
a
pleasant
pastime
not
until
her
birthday
was
the
knitting
finished
and
as
she
took
the
last
stitches
a
little
fell
out
in
the
was
a
string
of
pearls
that
had
belonged
to
marguerite
it
was
a
precious
family
heirloom
and
although
marguerite
could
not
wear
the
necklace
until
she
was
old
enough
to
go
to
her
first
great
court
ball
it
made
her
very
proud
and
happy
to
think
that
of
all
the
grandchildren
in
the
family
she
had
been
chosen
as
the
one
to
wear
her
name
that
means
pearl
and
had
inherited
on
that
account
the
beautiful
von
behren
necklace
when
the
knitting
was
done
there
was
a
charming
birthday
feast
in
her
honour
they
crowned
her
with
flowers
and
every
one
even
the
dignified
old
grandfather
did
her
bidding
until
nightfall
because
it
was
day
and
she
was
its
queen
closing
the
book
lloyd
lay
back
among
the
cushions
smiling
for
the
twentieth
time
over
marguerite
happiness
and
planning
the
beautiful
she
herself
would
like
to
have
if
were
to
be
had
for
the
wishing
it
should
be
as
big
as
a
and
the
first
gift
to
be
unwound
should
be
a
tiny
ring
set
with
an
emerald
because
that
is
the
lucky
stone
for
people
born
in
may
she
already
owned
so
many
books
and
trinkets
that
she
hardly
knew
what
else
to
wish
for
unless
it
might
be
a
coral
fan
chain
and
a
manicure
set
but
deep
down
in
the
heart
of
the
ball
she
would
like
to
find
a
that
would
grant
her
wishes
like
an
aladdin
lamp
whenever
it
was
rubbed
she
must
have
fallen
asleep
in
the
midst
of
her
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
only
a
minute
after
she
closed
her
book
that
she
heard
the
five
train
whistling
at
the
station
and
while
she
was
still
rubbing
her
eyes
she
saw
her
father
coming
up
the
avenue
all
day
she
had
had
a
lingering
hope
that
he
might
bring
her
something
when
he
came
out
from
the
city
if
it
nothing
but
a
bag
of
peanuts
she
thought
it
will
be
better
than
having
a
birthday
go
by
without
anything
when
all
the
othahs
have
been
neahly
as
nice
as
christmas
she
peeped
out
between
the
curtains
scanning
him
eagerly
as
he
came
toward
the
house
but
there
was
no
package
in
either
hand
and
no
suggestive
parcel
bulged
from
any
of
his
pockets
i
not
be
a
baby
lloyd
whispered
to
herself
winking
her
eyelids
rapidly
to
clear
away
a
sort
of
mist
that
seemed
to
blur
the
landscape
i
too
old
to
care
so
much
still
it
was
such
a
disappointment
added
to
all
the
others
that
the
day
had
brought
that
she
buried
her
face
in
the
cushions
and
cried
softly
she
could
hear
her
father
voice
in
the
next
room
presently
it
seemed
quite
loud
and
cheerful
more
cheerful
than
it
had
sounded
since
her
mother
dreadful
neuralgic
headaches
had
begun
a
few
minutes
later
she
heard
her
mother
laugh
it
was
such
a
welcome
sound
that
she
hastily
dried
her
eyes
and
started
to
run
in
to
see
what
had
caused
it
but
she
paused
as
she
passed
the
mirror
her
eyes
were
so
red
that
she
knew
she
would
be
questioned
and
she
concluded
it
would
be
better
to
wait
until
she
was
dressed
for
dinner
so
she
sat
looking
out
of
the
window
till
the
big
hall
clock
struck
six
and
then
hastily
bathing
her
eyes
she
slipped
into
a
fresh
white
dress
and
looking
carefully
at
herself
in
the
mirror
concluded
that
she
had
waited
long
enough
to
her
surprise
she
found
her
mother
sitting
up
in
a
big
morris
chair
by
the
window
maybe
it
was
the
pink
silk
kimono
she
wore
that
brought
a
faint
tinge
of
colour
to
her
cheeks
but
whatever
it
was
she
looked
well
and
natural
again
and
for
the
first
time
in
six
long
days
the
neuralgic
headache
was
all
gone
and
the
lines
of
suffering
were
smoothed
out
of
her
face
the
wide
glass
doors
opening
on
to
the
balcony
were
standing
open
and
through
the
vines
stole
the
golden
sunset
light
the
chirping
of
robins
the
smell
of
grass
and
the
heavy
sweetness
of
the
locust
blooms
lloyd
rubbed
her
eyes
thinking
she
surely
must
be
dreaming
there
on
the
balcony
stood
a
table
all
set
as
if
for
a
pink
party
there
were
flowers
and
bonbons
in
the
silver
dishes
and
in
the
centre
mom
beck
was
proudly
placing
a
mammoth
birthday
cake
wreathed
in
pink
icing
roses
and
crowned
with
twelve
pink
candles
ready
for
the
lighting
oh
mothah
she
cried
i
i
thought
she
did
not
finish
the
sentence
but
something
in
her
surprised
tone
the
sudden
flushing
of
her
face
and
the
traces
of
tears
still
in
her
eyes
told
what
she
meant
you
thought
mother
had
forgotten
whispered
sherman
tenderly
as
lloyd
hid
her
face
on
her
shoulder
no
not
for
one
minute
dear
but
the
pain
was
so
bad
this
morning
when
you
came
to
my
room
that
i
could
talk
then
you
were
out
riding
so
long
this
morning
and
when
i
wakened
after
lunch
and
sent
mom
beck
to
find
you
she
said
you
were
asleep
in
your
room
papa
jack
and
i
have
been
planning
a
great
surprise
for
you
and
he
did
not
want
to
mention
it
until
all
the
arrangements
were
completed
that
is
why
there
was
no
birthday
surprise
for
you
at
breakfast
but
you
soon
be
a
very
happy
little
girl
for
this
surprise
is
something
you
have
been
wanting
for
more
than
a
year
how
suddenly
the
whole
world
had
changed
for
the
little
colonel
the
sunshine
had
never
seemed
so
golden
the
locust
blooms
so
deliciously
sweet
her
birthday
had
not
been
forgotten
after
all
chair
was
wheeled
to
the
table
on
the
balcony
and
lloyd
took
her
seat
with
sparkling
eyes
she
wondered
what
the
surprise
could
be
and
felt
sure
that
papa
jack
would
not
tell
her
until
the
cake
was
cut
and
the
last
birthday
wish
made
with
the
blowing
of
the
birthday
candles
he
had
intended
to
save
his
news
to
serve
with
the
dessert
but
when
he
questioned
lloyd
as
to
how
she
had
spent
the
day
and
laughed
at
her
for
reading
the
old
tale
of
marguerite
so
many
times
his
secret
escaped
him
before
he
knew
it
turning
to
sherman
he
said
by
the
way
elizabeth
our
birthday
gift
for
lloyd
might
be
called
a
sort
of
then
he
looked
at
his
little
daughter
with
a
teasing
smile
as
he
continued
i
wonder
if
you
can
guess
my
riddle
at
first
your
will
unroll
a
day
and
night
on
the
cars
then
a
drive
through
a
park
where
you
rode
in
a
once
upon
a
time
but
through
which
you
shall
go
in
an
automobile
this
time
if
you
wish
there
be
some
shopping
maybe
and
after
that
flags
flying
and
bands
playing
and
crowds
of
people
waving
he
had
intended
to
stop
there
but
the
wondering
expression
on
her
face
carried
him
on
further
i
ca
undertake
to
say
how
much
your
can
hold
but
somewhere
near
the
centre
of
it
will
be
a
meeting
with
betty
and
eugenia
and
perhaps
a
glimpse
of
the
gate
of
the
giant
scissors
that
you
are
always
talking
about
as
lloyd
listened
a
look
of
utter
astonishment
crept
over
her
face
then
she
suddenly
sprang
from
her
chair
and
running
to
her
father
put
a
hand
on
each
shoulder
papa
jack
she
cried
breathlessly
look
me
straight
in
the
eyes
are
you
in
earnest
you
do
mean
that
we
are
going
abroad
do
you
it
be
anything
so
lovely
as
that
could
it
for
answer
he
drew
an
envelope
from
his
pocket
and
shook
it
before
her
eyes
look
for
yourself
he
said
this
is
to
show
that
we
are
listed
for
passage
on
a
steamer
going
to
antwerp
the
first
of
june
you
may
begin
to
pack
your
trunk
next
week
if
you
wish
it
was
impossible
for
lloyd
to
eat
any
more
after
that
she
was
too
excited
and
happy
and
there
were
countless
questions
she
wanted
to
ask
it
bettah
than
a
hundred
house
pahties
she
exclaimed
as
she
blew
out
the
last
birthday
candle
it
the
loveliest
that
evah
was
and
i
suah
that
nobody
in
all
kentucky
is
as
happy
as
i
am
now
chapter
ii
the
begins
to
unwind
lloyd
began
to
unroll
the
morning
that
her
father
took
her
to
town
to
choose
her
own
steamer
trunk
and
some
of
the
things
that
were
to
go
in
it
she
packed
and
unpacked
it
many
times
in
the
two
weeks
that
followed
although
she
knew
that
mom
beck
would
do
the
final
packing
and
probably
take
out
half
the
things
which
she
insisted
upon
crowding
into
it
every
morning
it
was
a
fresh
delight
to
waken
and
find
it
standing
by
her
reminding
her
of
the
journey
they
would
soon
begin
together
and
when
the
journey
was
actually
begun
she
settled
back
in
her
seat
with
a
happy
sigh
now
i
commence
to
count
my
packages
as
they
fall
out
she
said
i
think
i
ought
to
count
what
i
see
from
the
car
windows
as
one
for
i
enjoy
looking
out
at
the
different
places
we
pass
moah
than
i
evah
enjoyed
my
biggest
pictuah
books
then
count
this
number
two
said
her
father
putting
a
flat
square
parcel
in
her
lap
lloyd
looked
puzzled
as
she
opened
it
there
was
only
a
blank
book
inside
bound
in
russia
leather
with
the
word
record
stamped
on
it
in
gilt
i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
keep
a
partnership
diary
he
said
we
can
take
turns
in
writing
in
it
and
some
day
when
you
are
grown
and
your
mother
and
i
are
old
and
gray
it
will
help
us
to
remember
much
of
the
journey
that
otherwise
might
pass
out
of
our
memories
so
many
things
happen
when
one
is
travelling
that
they
are
apt
to
crowd
each
other
out
of
mind
unless
a
record
is
kept
of
them
we
begin
as
soon
as
we
get
on
the
ship
said
lloyd
mothah
shall
write
first
then
you
and
then
i
and
let
put
photographs
in
it
too
as
walton
did
in
hers
it
will
be
like
writing
a
real
book
package
numbah
two
is
lovely
papa
jack
it
happened
that
sherman
was
the
only
one
who
made
an
entry
in
the
record
for
more
than
a
week
sherman
felt
the
motion
of
the
vessel
too
much
to
be
able
to
do
more
than
lie
out
on
deck
in
her
the
little
colonel
while
she
was
not
at
all
seasick
was
afraid
to
attempt
writing
until
she
reached
land
the
table
jiggles
so
she
complained
when
she
sat
down
at
a
desk
in
the
ship
library
i
afraid
that
i
spoil
the
page
you
write
it
papa
jack
she
put
back
the
pen
and
stood
at
his
elbow
while
he
wrote
put
down
about
all
the
steamah
lettahs
that
we
got
she
suggested
and
the
little
japanese
stove
allison
walton
sent
me
for
my
muff
and
the
books
rob
sent
oh
yes
and
the
captain
name
and
how
long
the
ship
is
and
how
many
tons
of
things
to
eat
they
have
on
board
mom
beck
believe
me
when
i
tell
her
unless
i
can
show
it
to
her
in
black
and
white
after
they
had
explored
the
vessel
together
her
father
was
ready
to
settle
down
in
his
in
a
sheltered
corner
and
read
aloud
or
sleep
but
the
little
colonel
grew
tired
of
being
wrapped
like
a
mummy
in
her
steamer
rug
she
did
not
care
to
read
long
at
a
time
and
she
grew
tired
of
looking
at
nothing
but
water
soon
she
began
walking
up
and
down
the
deck
looking
for
something
to
entertain
her
in
one
place
some
little
girls
were
busy
with
scissors
and
making
paper
dolls
farther
along
two
boys
were
playing
checkers
and
under
the
stairs
a
group
of
children
gathered
around
their
governess
were
listening
to
a
fairy
tale
lloyd
longed
to
join
them
for
she
fairly
ached
for
some
amusement
she
paused
an
instant
with
her
hand
on
the
rail
as
she
heard
one
sentence
and
the
white
prince
clasping
the
crystal
ball
waved
his
plumed
cap
to
the
gnome
and
vanished
wondering
what
the
story
was
about
lloyd
walked
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
deck
only
to
find
another
long
uninteresting
row
of
sleepy
figures
stretched
out
in
and
half
hidden
in
rugs
and
cloaks
she
turned
to
go
back
but
paused
as
she
caught
sight
of
a
girl
about
her
own
age
standing
against
the
deck
railing
looking
over
into
the
sea
she
was
not
a
pretty
girl
her
face
was
too
dark
and
thin
according
to
standard
of
beauty
and
her
mouth
looked
as
if
it
were
used
to
saying
disagreeable
things
but
lloyd
thought
her
interesting
and
admired
the
scarlet
jacket
she
wore
with
its
gilt
braid
and
buttons
and
the
scarlet
cap
that
made
her
long
plaits
of
hair
look
black
as
a
crow
wing
by
contrast
her
hair
was
pretty
and
hung
far
below
her
waist
tied
at
the
end
with
two
bows
of
scarlet
ribbon
the
girl
glanced
up
as
lloyd
passed
and
although
there
was
a
cool
stare
in
her
queer
black
eyes
lloyd
found
herself
greatly
interested
she
wanted
to
make
the
stranger
acquaintance
and
passed
back
and
forth
several
times
to
steal
another
side
glance
at
her
as
she
turned
for
the
third
time
to
retrace
her
steps
she
was
nearly
knocked
off
her
feet
by
two
noisy
boys
who
bumped
against
her
they
were
playing
horse
to
the
annoyance
of
all
the
passengers
on
deck
stepping
on
people
toes
knocking
over
chairs
and
stumbling
against
the
stewards
who
were
hurrying
along
with
their
heavy
trays
of
beef
tea
and
lemonade
lloyd
had
seen
the
boys
several
times
before
they
were
little
fellows
of
six
and
nine
with
unusually
thin
legs
and
shrill
voices
and
were
always
eating
every
time
a
deck
steward
passed
they
grabbed
a
share
of
whatever
he
carried
they
seemed
to
have
discovered
some
secret
passage
to
the
supplies
their
blouses
were
pouched
out
all
around
with
the
store
of
gingersnaps
nuts
and
apples
which
they
had
managed
to
stow
away
as
a
reserve
fund
lloyd
had
seen
the
larger
boy
draw
out
six
bananas
one
after
another
from
his
blouse
and
then
squirm
and
wriggle
and
almost
stand
on
his
head
to
reach
the
seventh
which
had
slipped
around
to
his
back
while
he
was
eating
the
others
they
were
munching
raisins
now
as
they
ran
after
their
collision
with
lloyd
they
stopped
running
and
suddenly
began
calling
here
fido
here
fido
lloyd
looked
around
eagerly
expecting
to
see
some
pet
dog
and
wishing
that
she
had
one
of
the
many
pet
animals
left
behind
at
locust
to
amuse
her
now
but
no
dog
was
in
sight
the
girl
in
the
scarlet
jacket
turned
around
with
an
angry
scowl
stop
calling
me
that
howl
sattawhite
she
exclaimed
crossly
tell
mamma
you
know
what
she
said
she
do
to
you
if
you
called
me
anything
but
fidelia
and
you
know
what
she
said
she
do
to
you
if
you
kept
calling
me
howl
shouted
the
larger
of
the
boys
making
a
saucy
face
and
darting
forward
to
give
one
of
her
long
plaits
of
hair
a
sudden
pull
quick
as
a
flash
fidelia
turned
and
catching
him
by
the
wrists
twisted
them
till
he
began
to
whimper
with
pain
and
tried
to
set
his
teeth
in
her
hand
you
bite
me
you
little
beast
she
cried
you
just
dare
and
i
tell
mamma
how
you
spit
at
the
waiter
the
morning
we
left
the
hotel
lloyd
was
scandalised
they
were
quarrelling
like
two
little
dogs
seemingly
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
a
hundred
people
were
within
hearing
as
fidelia
seemed
to
be
getting
the
upper
hand
the
little
brother
joined
in
calling
in
a
high
piping
voice
and
if
you
squeal
on
howell
fidelia
sattawhite
i
tell
mamma
how
you
went
out
walking
by
yourself
in
new
york
when
she
told
you
not
to
and
took
her
new
purse
and
lost
it
so
there
miss
smarty
oh
those
dreadful
american
children
said
an
english
woman
near
lloyd
they
all
alike
at
least
the
ones
who
travel
i
have
never
seen
any
yet
that
had
any
manners
they
are
all
pert
and
spoiled
fancy
an
english
child
now
making
such
a
scene
in
public
the
little
colonel
could
feel
her
face
growing
painfully
red
she
was
indignant
at
being
classed
with
such
rude
children
and
walked
quickly
away
at
the
cabin
door
she
met
a
maid
who
coming
out
on
deck
with
something
wrapped
carefully
in
an
embroidered
shawl
sat
down
on
one
of
the
empty
benches
scarcely
was
she
seated
when
the
two
boys
pounced
down
upon
her
and
began
pulling
at
the
blanket
oh
let
me
see
beauty
fanchette
begged
howell
make
him
sit
up
and
do
some
tricks
the
maid
pushed
them
away
with
a
strong
hand
and
then
carefully
drew
aside
a
corner
of
the
covering
lloyd
gave
an
exclamation
of
pleasure
for
the
head
that
popped
out
was
that
of
a
bright
little
french
poodle
she
had
thought
many
times
that
morning
of
the
two
bobs
and
good
old
fritz
dead
and
gone
of
boots
the
and
the
goat
and
the
gobbler
and
the
parrot
all
the
animals
she
had
loved
and
played
with
at
locust
wishing
she
had
them
with
her
now
as
she
saw
the
bright
eyes
of
the
poodle
peeping
over
the
blanket
she
forgot
that
she
was
a
stranger
and
running
across
the
deck
she
stooped
down
beside
it
oh
the
darling
little
dog
she
exclaimed
touching
the
silky
hair
softly
may
i
hold
him
for
a
minute
the
maid
smiled
but
shook
her
head
ah
that
the
madame
will
not
allow
she
said
it
cost
a
thousand
dollars
explained
howell
eagerly
and
mamma
thinks
more
of
it
than
she
does
of
us
does
she
henny
the
small
boy
nodded
with
a
finger
in
his
mouth
show
her
beauty
bracelet
fanchette
said
howell
turning
back
another
fold
of
the
blanket
the
maid
lifted
a
little
white
paw
on
which
sparkled
a
tiny
diamond
bracelet
lloyd
drew
a
long
breath
of
astonishment
some
of
its
teeth
are
filled
with
gold
continued
howell
we
had
to
stay
a
whole
week
in
new
york
while
beauty
was
in
the
dog
hospital
having
them
filled
they
could
only
do
a
little
at
a
time
one
of
his
tricks
is
to
laugh
so
that
he
shows
all
his
fillings
laugh
beauty
he
commanded
laugh
old
fellow
and
show
your
gold
teeth
he
shook
a
dirty
finger
in
the
poodle
face
and
it
obediently
stretched
its
mouth
to
show
all
its
little
teeth
see
exclaimed
howell
much
pleased
do
it
again
but
the
maid
interfered
your
mother
told
you
not
to
touch
beauty
again
you
have
the
poor
little
thing
mouth
stretched
till
it
had
the
if
you
were
watched
all
the
time
go
away
you
are
a
naughty
boy
howell
lips
shot
out
in
a
sullen
pout
and
the
maid
not
knowing
what
he
might
do
next
rose
with
the
poodle
in
her
arms
and
walked
to
the
other
side
of
the
vessel
the
little
beast
was
dead
he
muttered
i
get
scolded
and
punished
for
nothing
at
all
whenever
it
is
around
it
and
fidelia
i
have
any
use
for
girls
and
after
this
uncivil
remark
he
waited
for
the
angry
retort
which
he
thought
would
naturally
follow
but
to
his
surprise
lloyd
only
laughed
she
found
him
amusing
even
if
he
was
rude
and
cross
and
she
could
not
wonder
that
he
had
such
an
opinion
of
girls
after
witnessing
his
quarrel
with
fidelia
the
boys
had
begun
it
but
she
was
older
and
could
have
turned
it
aside
had
she
wished
and
she
thought
it
perfectly
natural
that
he
should
dislike
the
dog
if
he
thought
his
mother
preferred
its
comfort
to
his
you
like
dogs
if
you
could
have
one
like
my
old
fritz
began
lloyd
glad
of
some
one
to
talk
to
sitting
down
on
the
bench
that
the
maid
had
left
she
began
talking
of
him
and
the
pony
and
the
other
pets
at
locust
at
first
the
boys
listened
carelessly
howell
cracked
his
whip
and
henderson
slapped
his
feet
with
the
ends
of
the
reins
he
wore
they
were
not
used
to
having
stories
told
them
except
when
they
were
being
scolded
and
their
mother
or
the
maid
told
them
tales
of
what
happens
to
bad
little
boys
when
they
will
not
obey
although
lloyd
wild
ride
in
a
with
one
of
the
two
little
knights
began
thrillingly
they
listened
with
one
foot
out
ready
to
run
at
first
word
of
the
moral
lecture
which
they
thought
would
surely
come
at
the
end
the
poodle
had
a
maid
to
make
it
happy
and
comfortable
every
moment
of
its
pampered
little
life
the
boys
had
some
one
to
see
that
they
were
properly
clothed
and
fed
and
their
nursery
at
home
looked
as
if
a
toy
store
had
been
emptied
into
it
but
no
one
took
any
interest
in
their
amusement
when
they
asked
questions
the
answer
always
was
oh
run
along
and
do
bother
me
now
there
were
no
quiet
bedtime
talks
for
them
to
smooth
the
snarls
out
of
the
day
their
mother
was
always
dining
out
or
receiving
company
at
that
time
and
their
nurse
hurried
them
to
sleep
with
threats
of
the
bugaboos
under
the
bed
that
would
catch
them
if
they
were
not
still
they
suspected
that
the
little
colonel
stories
would
soon
lead
to
a
lecture
on
quarrelling
presently
they
forgot
their
fears
in
the
interest
of
the
tale
the
youngest
boy
sidled
a
little
nearer
and
climbed
up
on
the
end
of
the
bench
beside
her
then
howell
dragging
his
whip
behind
him
came
a
step
closer
then
another
till
he
too
was
on
the
bench
beside
her
she
had
never
had
such
a
flattering
audience
they
never
took
their
eyes
from
her
face
and
listened
with
such
breathless
attention
that
she
talked
on
and
on
wondering
how
long
she
could
hold
their
interest
they
listen
to
me
just
as
people
do
to
betty
she
thought
proudly
an
hour
went
by
and
half
of
another
and
the
bugle
blew
the
first
go
on
demanded
howell
edging
closer
we
ai
hungry
are
we
henny
but
i
must
go
and
get
ready
for
dinner
said
lloyd
rising
will
you
tell
us
some
more
begged
howell
holding
her
skirts
with
his
dirty
little
hand
yes
yes
promised
lloyd
laughing
and
breaking
loose
from
his
hold
i
tell
you
as
many
stories
as
you
want
it
was
a
rash
promise
for
next
day
no
sooner
had
she
finished
breakfast
and
started
to
take
her
morning
walk
around
the
deck
with
her
father
than
the
boys
were
at
her
heels
they
were
eating
bananas
as
they
staggered
along
and
as
fast
as
one
disappeared
another
was
dragged
out
of
their
blouses
which
seemed
pouched
out
all
around
their
waists
with
an
inexhaustible
supply
up
and
down
they
followed
her
until
papa
jack
began
to
laugh
and
ask
what
she
had
done
to
tame
the
little
savages
as
soon
as
she
stopped
at
her
chair
they
dropped
down
on
the
floor
waiting
for
her
to
begin
their
devotion
amused
her
at
first
and
gratified
her
later
when
the
english
woman
who
had
complained
of
their
manners
stopped
to
speak
to
her
you
are
a
real
little
samaritan
she
said
to
keep
those
two
nuisances
quiet
the
passengers
owe
you
a
vote
of
thanks
it
is
very
sweet
of
you
my
dear
to
sacrifice
yourself
for
others
in
that
way
lloyd
grew
very
red
she
had
not
looked
upon
it
as
a
sacrifice
she
had
been
amusing
herself
but
after
awhile
did
become
very
tiresome
as
a
steady
occupation
she
groaned
whenever
she
saw
the
boys
coming
toward
her
fidelia
joined
them
on
several
occasions
but
her
appearance
was
always
the
signal
for
a
quarrel
to
begin
not
until
one
morning
when
the
boys
were
locked
in
their
stateroom
for
punishment
did
she
have
a
chance
to
speak
to
lloyd
by
herself
the
boys
opened
a
this
morning
explained
fidelia
they
had
been
forbidden
to
touch
it
poor
beauty
was
asleep
on
the
couch
just
under
it
and
a
big
wave
sloshed
over
him
and
nearly
drowned
him
he
was
soaked
through
it
gave
him
a
chill
and
mamma
is
in
a
terrible
way
about
him
howl
and
henny
told
fanchette
they
wanted
him
to
drown
that
why
they
did
it
they
will
be
locked
up
all
morning
i
should
think
that
you
be
glad
i
do
see
how
you
stand
them
tagging
after
you
all
the
time
they
are
the
meanest
boys
i
ever
knew
they
are
not
mean
to
me
said
lloyd
i
ca
help
feelin
sorry
for
them
then
she
stopped
abruptly
with
a
blush
feeling
that
was
not
a
polite
thing
to
say
to
the
boys
sister
i
sure
i
do
see
why
you
should
feel
sorry
for
them
said
fidelia
angrily
at
which
the
little
colonel
was
more
embarrassed
than
ever
she
could
not
tell
fidelia
that
it
was
because
a
little
poodle
received
the
fondling
and
attention
that
belonged
to
them
and
that
it
was
continual
faultfinding
and
nagging
that
made
the
boys
tease
her
so
after
a
pause
she
changed
the
subject
by
asking
her
what
she
wanted
most
to
see
in
europe
nothing
answered
fidelia
i
would
give
a
penny
to
see
all
the
old
ruins
and
cathedrals
and
picture
galleries
in
the
world
the
only
reason
that
i
care
to
go
abroad
is
to
be
able
to
say
i
have
been
to
those
places
when
the
other
girls
brag
about
what
they
seen
what
do
you
want
to
see
oh
thousands
of
things
exclaimed
lloyd
there
are
the
châteaux
where
kings
and
queens
have
lived
and
the
places
that
are
in
the
old
songs
like
bonnie
doon
and
london
bridge
and
twickenham
ferry
i
want
to
see
denmark
because
hans
christian
andersen
lived
there
and
wrote
his
fairy
tales
and
london
because
dickens
and
little
nell
lived
there
but
i
think
i
shall
enjoy
switzerland
most
we
expect
to
stay
there
a
long
time
it
is
such
a
brave
little
country
papa
has
told
me
a
great
deal
about
its
heroes
he
is
going
to
take
me
to
see
the
lion
of
lucerne
and
to
altdorf
under
the
where
william
tell
shot
the
apple
i
love
that
story
well
are
you
exclaimed
fidelia
opening
her
eyes
wide
and
looking
at
lloyd
as
if
she
were
some
sort
of
a
freak
it
was
her
tone
and
look
that
were
offensive
more
than
her
words
lloyd
was
furious
no
i
am
queah
miss
sattawhite
she
exclaimed
moving
away
much
ruffled
as
she
flounced
toward
the
cabin
her
eyes
very
bright
and
her
cheeks
very
red
she
looked
back
with
an
indignant
glance
i
wish
now
that
i
told
her
why
i
sorry
for
howl
and
henny
i
be
sorry
for
anybody
that
had
such
a
rude
sistah
but
there
were
other
children
on
the
vessel
whose
acquaintance
lloyd
made
before
the
week
was
over
she
played
checkers
and
quoits
with
the
boys
and
paper
dolls
with
the
girls
and
one
sunny
morning
she
was
invited
to
join
the
group
under
the
stairs
where
she
heard
the
story
of
the
white
prince
from
beginning
to
end
and
found
out
why
he
vanished
those
were
happy
days
on
the
big
steamer
despite
the
fact
that
howl
and
henny
haunted
her
like
two
hungry
little
shadows
sometimes
the
captain
himself
came
down
and
walked
with
her
the
shermans
sat
at
his
table
and
he
had
grown
quite
fond
of
the
little
kentucky
girl
with
her
soft
southern
accent
as
they
paced
the
deck
hand
in
hand
he
told
her
marvellous
tales
of
the
sea
till
she
grew
to
love
the
ship
and
the
heaving
water
world
around
them
and
wished
that
they
might
sail
on
and
on
and
never
come
to
land
until
the
end
of
the
summer
chapter
iii
lloyd
meets
hero
it
was
july
when
they
reached
switzerland
after
three
weeks
of
constant
travel
it
seemed
good
to
leave
boats
and
railroads
for
awhile
and
stop
to
rest
in
the
clean
old
town
of
geneva
the
windows
of
the
big
hotel
looked
out
on
the
lake
and
the
little
colonel
sitting
at
breakfast
the
morning
after
their
arrival
could
scarcely
eat
for
watching
the
scene
outside
gay
little
pleasure
boats
flashed
back
and
forth
on
the
sparkling
water
the
quay
and
bridge
were
thronged
with
people
from
open
windows
down
the
street
came
the
tinkle
of
pianos
and
out
on
the
pier
where
a
party
of
tourists
were
crowding
on
to
one
of
the
excursion
steamers
a
band
was
playing
its
merriest
holiday
music
far
away
in
the
distance
she
could
see
the
shining
snow
crown
of
mont
blanc
and
it
gave
her
an
odd
feeling
as
if
she
were
living
in
a
geography
lesson
to
know
that
she
was
bounded
on
one
side
by
the
famous
alpine
mountain
and
on
the
other
by
the
river
rhône
whose
source
she
had
often
traced
on
the
map
the
sunshine
the
music
and
the
gay
crowds
made
it
seem
to
lloyd
as
if
the
whole
world
were
out
for
a
holiday
and
she
ate
her
melon
and
listened
to
the
plans
for
the
day
with
the
sensation
that
something
very
delightful
was
about
to
happen
we
go
shopping
this
morning
said
sherman
i
want
lloyd
to
see
some
of
those
wonderful
music
boxes
they
make
here
the
dancing
bears
and
the
musical
the
chairs
that
play
when
you
sit
down
in
them
and
the
that
begin
a
tune
when
you
lift
them
up
lloyd
face
dimpled
with
pleasure
and
she
began
to
ask
eager
questions
could
we
take
one
to
mom
beck
mothah
a
that
would
play
comin
when
she
picked
it
up
it
would
surprise
her
so
she
would
think
it
was
bewitched
and
she
shriek
the
way
she
does
when
a
cattapillah
gets
on
her
lloyd
laughed
so
heartily
at
the
recollection
that
an
old
gentleman
sitting
at
an
opposite
table
smiled
in
sympathy
he
had
been
watching
the
child
ever
since
she
came
into
the
interested
in
every
look
and
gesture
he
was
a
dignified
old
french
soldier
tall
and
with
gray
hair
and
a
gray
moustache
drooping
heavily
over
his
mouth
but
the
eyes
under
his
shaggy
brows
were
so
kind
and
gentle
that
the
shyest
child
or
the
sorriest
waif
of
a
stray
dog
would
claim
him
for
a
friend
at
first
glance
the
little
colonel
was
so
busy
watching
the
scene
from
the
window
that
she
did
not
see
him
until
he
had
finished
his
breakfast
and
rose
from
the
table
as
he
came
toward
them
on
his
way
to
the
door
she
whispered
look
mothah
he
has
only
one
arm
like
grandfathah
i
wondah
if
he
was
a
soldiah
too
why
is
he
bowing
to
papa
jack
i
met
him
last
night
in
the
office
explained
her
father
when
the
old
gentleman
had
passed
out
of
hearing
we
got
into
conversation
over
the
dog
he
had
with
him
a
magnificent
bernard
that
had
been
trained
as
a
war
dog
to
go
out
with
the
ambulances
to
hunt
for
dead
and
wounded
soldiers
major
pierre
de
vaux
is
the
old
man
name
he
served
many
years
in
the
french
army
but
was
retired
after
the
siege
of
strasburg
the
clerk
told
me
that
it
was
there
that
the
major
lost
his
arm
and
received
his
country
medal
for
some
act
of
bravery
he
is
well
known
here
in
geneva
where
he
comes
every
summer
for
a
few
weeks
oh
i
hope
i
see
the
war
dog
cried
the
little
colonel
what
do
you
suppose
his
name
is
the
waiter
who
was
changing
their
plates
could
not
resist
this
temptation
to
show
off
the
little
english
he
knew
hes
name
is
mademoiselle
he
answered
he
vair
smart
dog
he
know
sing
somebody
say
to
him
same
as
a
person
you
probably
see
him
as
we
go
out
to
the
carriage
said
sherman
he
follows
the
major
constantly
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
sherman
went
up
to
her
room
for
her
hat
lloyd
who
had
worn
hers
down
to
breakfast
wandered
out
into
the
hall
to
wait
for
her
there
was
a
tall
carved
chair
standing
near
the
elevator
and
lloyd
climbed
into
it
to
her
great
confusion
something
inside
of
it
gave
a
loud
click
as
she
seated
herself
and
began
to
play
it
played
so
loudly
that
lloyd
was
both
startled
and
embarrassed
it
seemed
to
her
that
every
one
in
the
hotel
must
hear
the
noise
and
know
that
she
had
started
it
silly
old
thing
she
muttered
as
with
a
very
red
face
she
slipped
down
and
walked
hurriedly
away
she
intended
to
go
into
the
but
in
her
confusion
turned
to
the
left
instead
of
the
right
and
ran
against
some
one
coming
out
of
the
hotel
office
it
was
the
major
oh
i
beg
your
pahdon
she
cried
blushing
still
more
from
the
twinkle
in
his
eye
she
was
sure
that
he
had
witnessed
her
mortifying
encounter
with
the
musical
chair
but
his
first
words
made
her
forget
her
embarrassment
he
spoke
in
the
best
of
english
but
with
a
slight
accent
that
lloyd
thought
very
odd
and
charming
ah
it
is
sherman
little
daughter
he
told
me
last
night
that
you
had
come
to
switzerland
because
it
was
a
land
of
heroes
and
he
was
sure
that
you
would
be
especially
interested
in
mine
so
come
hero
my
brave
fellow
and
be
presented
to
the
little
american
lady
give
her
your
paw
sir
he
stepped
aside
to
let
the
great
creature
past
him
and
lloyd
uttered
an
exclamation
of
delight
he
was
so
unusually
large
and
beautiful
his
curly
coat
of
tawny
yellow
was
as
soft
as
silk
and
a
great
ruff
of
white
circled
his
neck
like
a
collar
his
breast
was
white
too
and
his
paws
and
his
eyes
had
a
wistful
human
look
that
went
straight
to
heart
she
shook
the
offered
paw
and
then
impulsively
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
exclaiming
oh
you
deah
old
fellow
i
ca
help
lovin
you
you
the
beautifulest
dog
i
evah
saw
he
understood
the
caress
if
not
the
words
for
he
reached
up
to
touch
her
cheek
with
his
tongue
and
wagged
his
tail
as
if
he
were
welcoming
a
friend
just
then
sherman
stepped
out
of
the
elevator
hero
said
the
little
colonel
i
must
go
now
but
i
hope
see
you
when
i
come
back
nodding
to
the
major
she
followed
her
mother
out
to
the
street
where
her
father
stood
waiting
beside
an
open
carriage
lloyd
enjoyed
the
drive
that
morning
as
they
spun
along
beside
the
river
up
and
down
the
strange
streets
with
the
queer
foreign
signs
over
the
shop
doors
once
as
they
drove
along
the
quay
they
met
the
major
and
the
dog
and
in
response
to
a
courtly
bow
the
little
colonel
waved
her
hand
and
smiled
the
empty
sleeve
recalled
her
grandfather
and
gave
her
a
friendly
feeling
for
the
old
soldier
she
looked
back
at
hero
as
long
as
she
could
see
a
glimpse
of
his
white
and
yellow
curls
it
was
nearly
noon
when
they
stopped
at
a
place
where
sherman
wanted
to
leave
an
enamelled
to
be
repaired
lloyd
was
not
interested
in
the
and
could
not
understand
the
conversation
her
father
and
mother
were
having
with
the
shopkeeper
about
enamelling
so
saying
that
she
would
go
out
and
sit
in
the
carriage
until
they
were
ready
to
come
she
slipped
away
she
liked
to
watch
the
stir
of
the
streets
it
was
interesting
to
guess
what
the
foreign
signs
meant
and
to
listen
to
the
strange
speech
around
her
besides
there
was
a
band
playing
somewhere
down
the
street
and
children
were
tugging
at
their
nurses
hands
to
hurry
them
along
some
carried
dolls
dressed
in
the
quaint
costumes
of
swiss
peasants
and
some
had
balloons
a
man
with
a
bunch
of
them
like
a
cluster
of
great
red
bubbles
had
just
sold
out
on
the
corner
so
she
sat
in
the
sunshine
looking
around
her
with
eager
interested
eyes
the
coachman
high
up
on
his
box
seemed
as
interested
as
herself
at
least
he
sat
up
very
straight
and
stiff
but
it
was
only
his
back
that
lloyd
saw
he
had
been
at
a
fête
the
night
before
there
seems
to
be
always
a
holiday
in
geneva
he
had
stayed
long
at
the
merrymaking
and
had
taken
many
mugs
of
beer
they
made
him
drowsy
and
stupid
the
american
gentleman
and
his
wife
stayed
long
in
the
enameller
shop
he
could
scarcely
keep
his
eyes
open
presently
although
he
never
moved
a
muscle
of
his
back
and
sat
up
stiff
and
straight
as
a
poker
he
was
sound
asleep
and
the
reins
in
his
grasp
slipped
lower
and
lower
and
lower
the
horse
was
an
old
one
stiffened
and
jaded
by
much
hard
travel
but
it
had
been
a
mettlesome
one
in
its
younger
days
with
the
recollection
of
many
exciting
adventures
now
although
it
seemed
half
asleep
dreaming
maybe
of
the
many
jaunts
it
had
taken
with
other
american
tourists
or
wondering
if
it
were
not
time
for
it
to
have
its
noonday
it
was
really
keeping
one
eye
open
nervously
watching
some
painters
on
the
sidewalk
they
were
putting
up
a
scaffold
against
a
building
in
order
that
they
might
paint
the
cornice
presently
the
very
thing
happened
that
the
old
horse
had
been
expecting
a
heavy
board
fell
from
the
scaffold
with
a
crash
knocking
over
a
ladder
which
fell
into
the
street
in
front
of
the
frightened
animal
now
the
old
horse
had
been
in
several
runaways
once
it
had
been
hurt
by
a
falling
ladder
and
it
had
never
recovered
from
its
fear
of
one
as
this
one
fell
just
under
it
nose
all
the
old
fright
and
pain
that
caused
its
first
runaway
seemed
to
come
back
to
its
memory
in
a
frenzy
of
terror
it
reared
plunged
forward
then
suddenly
turned
and
dashed
down
the
street
the
plunge
and
sudden
turn
threw
the
sleeping
coachman
from
the
box
to
the
street
with
the
lines
dragging
at
its
heels
the
frightened
horse
sped
on
the
little
colonel
clutching
frantically
at
the
seat
in
front
of
her
screamed
at
the
horse
to
stop
she
had
been
used
to
driving
ever
since
she
was
big
enough
to
grasp
the
reins
and
she
felt
that
if
she
could
only
reach
the
dragging
lines
she
could
control
the
horse
but
that
was
impossible
all
she
could
do
was
to
cling
to
the
seat
as
the
carriage
whirled
dizzily
around
corners
and
wonder
how
many
more
frightful
turns
it
would
make
before
she
should
be
thrown
out
the
white
houses
on
either
side
seemed
racing
past
them
nurses
ran
screaming
to
the
pavements
dragging
the
out
of
the
way
dogs
barked
and
teams
were
jerked
hastily
aside
some
one
dashed
out
of
a
shop
and
threw
his
arms
up
in
front
of
the
horse
to
stop
it
but
veering
to
one
side
it
only
plunged
on
the
faster
lloyd
hat
blew
off
her
face
turned
white
with
a
sickening
dread
and
her
breath
began
to
come
in
frightened
sobs
on
and
on
they
went
and
as
the
scenes
of
a
lifetime
will
be
crowded
into
a
moment
in
the
memory
of
a
drowning
man
so
a
thousand
things
came
flashing
into
lloyd
mind
she
saw
the
locust
avenue
all
white
and
sweet
in
blossom
time
and
thought
with
a
strange
thrill
of
that
she
would
never
ride
under
its
white
arch
again
then
she
saw
betty
face
on
the
pillow
as
she
had
lain
with
bandaged
eyes
telling
in
her
tremulous
little
voice
the
story
of
the
road
of
the
loving
heart
queerly
enough
with
that
came
the
thought
of
howl
and
henny
and
she
had
time
to
be
glad
that
she
had
amused
them
on
the
voyage
and
made
them
happy
then
came
her
mother
face
and
papa
jack
in
a
few
moments
she
told
herself
they
would
be
picking
up
her
poor
broken
lifeless
little
body
from
the
street
how
horribly
they
would
feel
and
then
she
screamed
and
shut
her
eyes
the
carriage
had
dashed
into
something
that
tore
off
a
wheel
there
was
a
crash
a
sound
as
of
splintering
wood
but
it
did
not
stop
their
mad
flight
with
a
horrible
bumping
motion
that
nearly
threw
her
from
the
carriage
at
every
jolt
they
still
kept
on
they
were
on
the
quay
now
the
noon
sun
on
the
water
flashed
into
her
eyes
like
the
blinding
light
thrown
back
from
a
then
something
white
and
yellow
darted
from
the
crowd
on
the
pavement
and
catching
the
horse
by
the
bit
swung
on
heavily
the
horse
dragged
along
for
a
few
paces
and
came
to
a
halt
trembling
like
a
leaf
a
wild
hurrah
went
up
from
both
sides
of
the
street
and
the
little
colonel
as
she
was
lifted
out
white
and
trembling
saw
that
it
was
a
huge
bernard
that
the
crowd
was
cheering
oh
it
she
cried
with
chattering
teeth
how
did
he
get
here
but
no
one
understood
her
question
the
faces
she
looked
into
while
beaming
with
friendly
interest
were
all
foreign
the
eager
exclamations
on
all
sides
were
uttered
in
a
foreign
tongue
there
was
no
one
to
take
her
home
and
in
her
fright
she
could
not
remember
the
name
of
their
hotel
but
in
the
midst
of
her
confusion
a
hearty
sentence
in
english
sounded
in
her
ear
and
a
strong
arm
caught
her
up
in
a
fatherly
embrace
it
was
the
major
who
came
pushing
through
the
crowd
to
reach
her
her
grandfather
himself
could
not
have
been
more
welcome
just
at
that
time
and
her
tears
came
fast
when
she
found
herself
in
his
friendly
shelter
the
shock
had
been
a
terrible
one
come
dear
child
he
exclaimed
gently
patting
her
shoulder
courage
we
are
almost
at
the
hotel
see
it
is
on
the
corner
there
the
father
and
mother
will
soon
be
here
wiping
her
eyes
he
led
her
across
the
street
explaining
as
he
went
how
it
happened
that
he
and
the
dog
were
on
the
street
when
she
passed
they
had
been
in
the
gardens
all
morning
and
were
going
home
to
lunch
when
they
heard
the
clatter
of
the
runaway
far
down
the
street
the
major
could
not
see
who
was
in
the
carriage
only
that
it
appeared
to
be
a
child
he
was
too
old
a
man
and
with
his
one
arm
too
helpless
to
attempt
to
stop
it
but
he
remembered
that
hero
had
once
shared
the
training
of
some
collies
for
police
service
before
it
had
been
decided
to
use
him
as
an
ambulance
dog
they
were
taught
to
spring
at
the
bridles
of
escaping
horses
i
was
doubtful
if
hero
remembered
those
early
lessons
said
the
major
but
i
called
out
to
him
sharply
for
the
love
of
heaven
to
stop
it
if
he
could
and
that
instant
he
was
at
the
horse
head
hanging
on
with
all
his
might
bravo
old
fellow
he
continued
turning
to
the
dog
as
he
spoke
we
are
proud
of
you
this
day
they
were
in
the
corridor
of
the
hotel
now
and
the
little
colonel
kneeling
beside
hero
and
putting
her
arms
around
his
neck
finished
her
sobbing
with
her
fair
little
face
laid
fondly
against
his
silky
coat
oh
you
deah
deah
old
hero
she
said
you
saved
me
and
i
love
you
fo
evah
and
evah
the
crowd
was
still
in
front
of
the
hotel
and
the
corridor
full
of
excited
servants
and
guests
when
and
sherman
hurried
in
they
had
taken
the
first
carriage
they
could
hail
and
driven
as
fast
as
possible
in
the
wake
of
the
runaway
sherman
was
trembling
so
violently
that
she
could
scarcely
stand
when
they
reached
the
hotel
the
clerk
who
ran
out
to
assure
them
of
the
little
colonel
safety
was
loud
in
his
praises
of
the
faithful
bernard
hero
had
known
many
masters
any
one
in
the
uniform
of
the
army
had
once
had
authority
over
him
he
had
been
taught
to
obey
many
voices
many
hands
had
fed
and
fondled
him
but
no
hand
had
ever
lain
quite
so
tenderly
on
his
head
as
the
little
colonel
no
one
had
ever
looked
into
his
eyes
so
gratefully
as
she
and
no
voice
had
ever
thrilled
him
with
as
loving
tones
as
hers
as
she
knelt
there
beside
him
calling
him
all
the
fond
endearing
names
she
knew
he
understood
far
better
than
if
he
had
been
human
that
she
loved
him
eagerly
licking
her
hands
and
wagging
his
tail
he
told
her
as
plainly
as
a
dog
can
talk
that
henceforth
he
would
be
one
of
her
best
and
most
faithful
of
friends
if
petting
and
praise
and
devoted
attention
could
spoil
a
dog
hero
head
would
certainly
have
been
turned
that
day
for
friends
and
strangers
alike
made
much
of
him
a
photographer
came
to
take
his
picture
for
the
leading
daily
paper
before
nightfall
his
story
was
repeated
in
every
home
in
geneva
no
servant
in
the
hotel
but
took
a
personal
pride
in
him
or
watched
his
chance
to
give
him
a
sly
sweetmeat
or
a
caress
but
being
a
dog
instead
of
a
human
the
attention
only
made
him
the
more
lovable
for
it
made
him
feel
that
it
was
a
kind
world
he
lived
in
and
everybody
was
his
friend
it
was
after
lunch
that
the
little
colonel
came
carrying
the
diary
now
with
the
record
of
their
journeying
put
it
all
down
in
the
book
papa
jack
she
demanded
i
nevah
forget
to
my
dyin
day
but
i
want
it
written
down
heah
in
black
and
white
that
hero
saved
me
chapter
iv
hero
story
late
that
afternoon
the
major
sat
out
in
the
shady
courtyard
of
the
hotel
where
vines
potted
plants
and
a
fountain
made
a
cool
green
garden
spot
he
was
thinking
of
his
little
daughter
who
had
been
dead
many
long
years
the
american
child
whom
his
dog
had
rescued
from
the
runaway
in
the
morning
was
wonderfully
like
her
she
had
the
same
fair
hair
he
thought
that
had
been
his
little
christine
great
beauty
the
same
delicate
pink
in
her
cheeks
the
same
mischievous
smile
dimpling
her
laughing
face
but
christine
eyes
had
not
been
a
starry
hazel
like
the
little
colonel
they
were
blue
as
the
she
used
to
gather
thirty
was
it
no
forty
years
ago
as
he
counted
the
years
the
thought
came
to
him
like
a
pain
that
he
was
an
old
old
man
now
all
alone
in
the
world
save
for
a
dog
and
a
niece
whom
he
scarcely
knew
and
seldom
saw
as
he
sat
there
with
his
head
bowed
down
dreaming
over
his
past
the
little
colonel
came
out
into
the
courtyard
she
had
dressed
early
and
gone
down
to
the
to
wait
until
her
mother
was
ready
for
dinner
but
catching
sight
of
the
major
through
the
long
glass
doors
she
laid
down
her
book
the
lonely
expression
of
his
furrowed
face
the
bowed
head
and
the
empty
sleeve
appealed
to
her
strongly
i
believe
i
go
out
and
talk
to
him
she
thought
if
grandfathah
were
away
off
in
a
strange
land
by
himself
like
that
i
want
somebody
to
cheer
him
up
it
is
always
good
to
feel
that
one
is
welcome
and
lloyd
was
glad
that
she
had
ventured
into
the
courtyard
when
she
saw
the
smile
that
lighted
the
major
face
at
sight
of
her
and
when
the
dog
rising
at
her
approach
came
forward
joyfully
wagging
his
tail
the
conversation
was
easy
to
begin
with
hero
for
a
subject
there
were
many
things
she
wanted
to
know
about
him
how
he
happened
to
belong
to
the
major
what
country
he
came
from
why
he
was
called
a
bernard
and
if
the
major
had
ever
owned
any
other
dogs
after
a
few
questions
it
all
came
about
as
she
had
hoped
it
would
the
old
man
settled
himself
back
in
his
chair
thought
a
moment
and
then
began
at
the
first
of
his
acquaintance
with
bernard
dogs
as
if
he
were
reading
a
story
from
a
book
away
up
in
the
alpine
mountains
too
high
for
trees
to
grow
where
there
is
only
bare
rock
and
snow
and
cutting
winds
climbs
the
road
that
is
known
as
the
great
bernard
pass
it
is
an
old
old
road
the
celts
crossed
it
when
they
invaded
italy
the
roman
legions
crossed
it
when
they
marched
out
to
subdue
gaul
and
germany
ten
hundred
years
ago
the
saracen
robbers
hid
among
its
rocks
to
waylay
unfortunate
travellers
you
will
read
about
all
that
in
your
history
sometime
and
about
the
famous
march
napoleon
made
across
it
on
his
way
to
marengo
but
the
most
interesting
fact
about
the
road
to
me
is
that
for
over
seven
hundred
years
there
has
been
a
monastery
high
up
on
the
bleak
called
the
monastery
of
bernard
once
when
i
was
travelling
through
the
alps
i
stopped
there
one
cold
night
almost
frozen
the
good
monks
welcomed
me
to
their
hospice
as
they
do
all
strangers
who
stop
for
food
and
shelter
and
treated
me
as
kindly
as
if
i
had
been
a
brother
in
the
morning
one
of
them
took
me
out
to
the
kennels
and
showed
me
the
dogs
that
are
trained
to
look
for
travellers
in
the
snow
you
may
imagine
with
what
pleasure
i
followed
him
and
listened
to
the
tales
he
told
me
he
said
there
is
not
as
much
work
for
the
dogs
now
as
there
used
to
be
years
ago
since
the
hospice
has
been
connected
with
the
valley
towns
by
telephone
travellers
can
inquire
about
the
state
of
the
weather
and
the
paths
before
venturing
up
the
dangerous
mountain
passes
still
the
storms
begin
with
little
warning
sometimes
and
wayfarers
are
overtaken
by
them
and
lost
in
the
blinding
snowfall
the
paths
fill
suddenly
and
but
for
the
dogs
many
would
perish
oh
i
know
interrupted
lloyd
eagerly
there
is
a
story
about
them
in
my
old
third
readah
and
a
pictuah
of
a
big
bernard
dog
with
a
flask
tied
around
his
neck
and
a
child
on
his
back
yes
answered
the
major
it
is
quite
probable
that
that
was
a
picture
of
the
dog
they
called
barry
he
was
with
the
good
monks
for
twelve
years
and
in
that
time
saved
the
lives
of
forty
travellers
there
is
a
monument
erected
to
him
in
paris
in
the
cemetery
for
dogs
the
sculptor
carved
that
picture
into
the
stone
the
noble
animal
with
a
child
on
his
back
as
if
he
were
in
the
act
of
carrying
it
to
the
hospice
twelve
years
is
a
long
time
for
a
dog
to
suffer
such
hardship
and
exposure
night
after
night
he
plunged
out
alone
into
the
deep
snow
and
the
darkness
barking
at
the
top
of
his
voice
to
attract
the
attention
of
lost
travellers
many
a
time
he
dropped
into
the
drifts
exhausted
with
scarcely
enough
strength
left
to
drag
himself
back
to
the
hospice
forty
lives
saved
is
a
good
record
you
may
be
sure
that
in
his
old
age
barry
was
tenderly
cared
for
the
monks
gave
him
a
pension
and
sent
him
to
berne
where
the
climate
is
much
warmer
when
he
died
a
taxidermist
preserved
his
skin
and
he
was
placed
in
the
museum
at
berne
where
he
stands
to
this
day
i
am
told
with
the
little
flask
around
his
neck
i
saw
him
there
one
time
and
although
barry
was
only
a
dog
and
i
an
officer
in
my
country
service
i
stood
with
uncovered
head
before
him
for
he
was
as
truly
a
hero
and
served
human
kind
as
nobly
as
if
he
had
fallen
on
the
field
of
battle
he
had
been
trained
like
a
soldier
to
his
duty
and
no
matter
how
the
storms
raged
on
the
mountains
how
dark
the
night
or
how
dangerous
the
paths
that
led
along
the
slippery
precipices
at
the
word
of
command
he
sprang
to
obey
only
a
dumb
beast
some
people
would
call
him
guided
only
by
brute
instinct
but
in
his
shaggy
old
body
beat
a
loving
heart
loyal
to
his
master
command
and
faithful
to
his
duty
as
i
stood
there
gazing
into
the
kind
old
face
i
thought
of
the
time
when
i
lay
wounded
on
the
field
of
strasburg
how
glad
i
would
have
been
to
have
seen
some
dog
like
barry
come
bounding
to
my
aid
i
had
fallen
in
a
thicket
where
the
ambulance
corps
did
not
discover
me
until
next
day
i
lay
there
all
that
black
night
wild
with
pain
groaning
for
water
i
could
see
the
lanterns
of
the
ambulances
as
they
moved
about
searching
for
the
wounded
among
the
many
dead
but
was
too
faint
from
loss
of
blood
to
raise
my
head
and
shout
for
help
they
told
me
afterward
that
if
my
wound
could
have
received
immediate
attention
perhaps
my
arm
might
have
been
saved
but
only
a
keen
sense
of
smell
could
have
traced
me
in
the
dense
thicket
where
i
lay
no
one
had
thought
of
training
dogs
for
ambulance
service
then
the
men
did
their
best
but
they
were
only
men
and
i
was
overlooked
until
it
was
too
late
to
save
my
arm
well
as
i
said
i
stood
and
looked
at
barry
wondering
if
it
were
not
possible
to
train
dogs
for
rescue
work
on
as
well
as
in
mountain
passes
the
more
i
thought
of
it
the
more
my
longing
grew
to
make
such
an
attempt
i
read
everything
i
could
find
about
trained
dogs
visited
kennels
where
collies
and
other
intelligent
sheepdogs
were
kept
and
corresponded
with
many
people
about
it
finally
i
found
a
man
who
was
as
much
interested
in
the
subject
as
herr
bungartz
is
his
name
to
him
chiefly
belongs
the
credit
for
the
development
of
the
use
of
ambulance
dogs
to
aid
the
wounded
on
the
field
of
battle
he
is
now
at
the
head
of
a
society
to
which
i
belong
it
has
over
a
thousand
members
including
many
princes
and
generals
we
furnish
the
money
that
supports
the
kennels
and
the
dogs
are
bred
and
trained
free
for
the
army
now
for
the
last
eight
years
it
has
been
my
greatest
pleasure
to
visit
the
kennels
where
as
many
as
fifty
dogs
are
kept
constantly
in
training
it
was
on
my
last
visit
that
i
got
hero
his
leg
had
been
hurt
in
some
accident
on
the
training
field
it
was
thought
that
he
was
too
much
disabled
to
ever
do
good
service
again
so
they
allowed
me
to
take
him
two
old
cripples
i
suppose
they
thought
we
were
comrades
in
misfortune
that
was
nearly
a
year
ago
i
took
him
to
an
eminent
surgeon
told
him
his
history
and
interested
him
in
his
case
he
treated
him
so
successfully
that
now
as
you
see
the
leg
is
entirely
well
sometimes
i
feel
that
it
is
my
duty
to
give
him
back
to
the
service
although
i
paid
for
the
rearing
of
a
fine
scotch
collie
in
his
stead
he
is
so
unusually
intelligent
and
well
trained
but
it
would
be
hard
to
part
with
such
a
good
friend
although
i
have
had
him
less
than
a
year
he
seems
very
much
attached
to
me
and
i
have
grown
more
fond
of
him
than
i
would
have
believed
possible
i
am
an
old
man
now
and
i
think
he
understands
that
he
is
all
i
have
good
hero
he
knows
he
is
a
comfort
to
his
old
master
at
the
sound
of
his
name
uttered
in
a
sad
voice
the
great
dog
got
up
and
laid
his
head
on
the
major
knee
looking
wistfully
into
his
face
of
you
ought
to
give
him
back
cried
the
little
colonel
if
he
were
mine
i
would
give
him
up
for
the
president
or
the
emperor
or
the
czar
or
but
for
the
soldiers
the
poor
wounded
soldiers
suggested
the
major
lloyd
hesitated
looking
from
the
dog
to
the
empty
sleeve
above
it
well
she
declared
at
last
i
would
give
him
up
while
the
country
is
at
peace
i
wait
till
the
last
minute
until
there
was
goin
to
be
an
awful
battle
and
then
i
make
them
promise
to
let
me
have
him
again
when
the
wah
was
ovah
just
the
minute
it
was
ovah
it
would
be
like
away
part
of
your
family
to
give
away
hero
suddenly
the
major
spoke
to
the
dog
in
french
a
quick
sharp
sentence
that
lloyd
could
not
understand
but
hero
without
an
hesitation
bounded
from
the
courtyard
where
they
sat
into
the
hall
of
the
hotel
through
the
glass
doors
she
could
see
him
leaping
up
the
stairs
and
almost
before
the
major
could
explain
that
he
had
sent
him
for
the
he
wore
in
service
the
dog
was
back
with
them
grasped
firmly
in
his
mouth
now
the
flask
said
the
major
while
the
dog
obeyed
the
second
order
he
opened
the
bags
for
lloyd
to
examine
them
they
were
marked
with
a
red
cross
in
a
square
of
white
and
contained
rolls
of
bandages
from
which
any
man
able
to
use
his
arms
could
help
himself
until
his
rescuer
brought
further
aid
the
flask
which
hero
brought
was
marked
in
the
same
way
and
the
major
buckled
it
to
his
collar
saying
as
he
fastened
first
that
and
then
the
in
place
when
a
dog
is
in
training
soldiers
pretending
to
be
dead
or
wounded
are
hidden
in
the
woods
or
ravines
and
he
is
taught
to
find
a
fallen
body
and
to
bark
loudly
if
the
soldier
is
in
some
place
too
remote
for
his
voice
to
bring
aid
the
dog
seizes
a
cap
a
handkerchief
or
a
belt
any
article
of
the
man
clothing
which
he
can
pick
up
and
dashes
back
to
the
nearest
ambulance
what
a
lovely
game
that
would
make
exclaimed
lloyd
do
you
suppose
that
i
could
train
the
two
bobs
to
do
that
we
often
play
soldiah
at
locust
now
what
is
it
you
say
to
hero
when
you
want
him
to
hunt
the
men
let
me
see
if
he
mind
me
the
major
repeated
the
command
but
i
ca
speak
french
she
said
in
dismay
what
is
it
in
english
hero
ca
understand
anything
in
english
said
the
major
laughing
at
the
perplexed
expression
that
crept
into
the
little
colonel
face
how
funny
she
exclaimed
i
nevah
thought
of
that
befo
i
supposed
of
that
all
animals
were
english
anyway
hero
comes
when
i
call
him
and
wags
his
tail
when
i
speak
just
as
if
he
undahstands
every
word
it
is
the
kindness
in
your
voice
he
understands
and
the
smile
in
your
eyes
the
affection
in
your
caress
that
language
is
the
same
the
world
over
to
men
and
animals
alike
but
he
never
would
start
out
to
hunt
the
wounded
soldiers
unless
you
gave
this
command
let
me
hear
if
you
can
say
it
after
me
lloyd
tripped
over
some
of
the
rough
sounds
as
she
repeated
the
sentence
but
tried
it
again
and
again
until
the
major
cried
bravo
you
shall
have
more
lessons
in
french
dear
child
until
you
can
give
the
command
so
well
that
hero
shall
obey
you
as
he
does
me
then
he
began
talking
of
christine
her
fair
hair
her
blue
eyes
her
playful
ways
and
lloyd
listening
drew
him
on
with
many
questions
till
the
little
french
maiden
seemed
to
stand
pictured
before
her
her
hands
filled
with
the
lovely
spring
flowers
of
the
motherland
suddenly
the
major
arose
bowing
courteously
for
sherman
seeing
them
from
the
doorway
had
smiled
and
started
toward
them
springing
up
lloyd
ran
to
meet
her
mothah
she
whispered
please
ask
the
majah
to
sit
at
ou
table
at
dinnah
he
such
a
deah
old
man
and
tells
such
things
and
he
lonesome
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
when
he
talked
about
his
little
daughtah
she
was
just
my
age
when
she
died
mothah
and
he
thinks
she
looked
like
me
the
major
courtly
manner
and
kind
face
had
already
aroused
sherman
interest
his
empty
sleeve
reminded
her
of
her
father
his
loneliness
appealed
to
her
sympathy
and
his
kindness
to
her
little
daughter
had
won
her
deepest
appreciation
she
turned
with
a
cordial
smile
to
repeat
lloyd
invitation
which
was
gladly
accepted
that
was
the
beginning
of
a
warm
friendship
from
that
time
he
was
included
in
their
plans
now
in
nearly
all
their
excursions
and
drives
there
were
four
in
the
party
instead
of
three
and
five
very
often
whenever
it
was
possible
hero
was
with
them
he
and
the
little
colonel
often
went
out
together
alone
it
grew
to
be
a
familiar
sight
in
the
town
the
graceful
child
and
the
big
tawny
bernard
walking
side
by
side
along
the
quay
she
was
not
afraid
to
venture
anywhere
with
such
a
guard
as
for
hero
he
followed
her
as
gladly
as
he
did
his
master
chapter
the
red
cross
of
geneva
a
week
after
the
runaway
the
handsomest
collar
that
could
be
bought
in
town
was
fastened
around
hero
neck
it
had
taken
a
long
time
to
get
it
for
sherman
went
to
many
shops
before
he
found
material
that
he
considered
good
enough
for
the
rescuer
of
his
little
daughter
then
the
jeweller
had
to
keep
it
several
days
while
he
engraved
an
inscription
on
the
gold
an
inscription
that
all
who
read
might
know
what
happened
on
a
certain
july
day
in
the
old
swiss
town
of
geneva
on
the
under
side
of
the
collar
was
a
stout
link
like
the
one
on
his
old
one
to
which
the
flask
could
be
fastened
when
he
was
harnessed
for
service
and
on
the
upper
side
finely
wrought
in
enamel
was
a
red
cross
on
a
white
square
papa
jack
exclaimed
lloyd
examining
it
with
interest
that
is
the
same
design
that
is
on
his
blanket
and
why
it
just
like
the
swiss
flag
she
cried
looking
out
at
the
banner
floating
from
the
pier
only
the
colours
are
turned
around
the
flag
has
a
white
cross
on
a
red
ground
and
this
is
a
red
cross
on
a
white
ground
why
did
you
have
it
put
on
the
collah
papa
jack
because
he
is
a
red
cross
dog
answered
her
father
no
papa
jack
excuse
me
for
contradictin
but
the
majah
said
he
was
a
bernard
dog
sherman
laughed
but
before
he
could
explain
he
was
called
to
the
office
to
answer
a
telegram
when
he
returned
lloyd
had
disappeared
to
find
the
major
and
ask
about
the
symbol
on
the
collar
she
found
him
in
his
favourite
seat
near
the
fountain
in
the
shady
courtyard
perching
on
a
bench
near
by
with
hero
for
a
she
asked
majah
is
hero
a
bernard
or
a
red
cross
dog
he
is
both
answered
the
major
smiling
at
her
puzzled
expression
he
is
the
first
because
he
belongs
to
that
family
of
dogs
and
he
is
the
second
because
he
was
adopted
by
the
red
cross
association
and
trained
for
its
service
you
know
what
that
is
of
course
still
lloyd
looked
puzzled
she
shook
her
head
no
i
nevah
heard
of
it
is
it
something
swiss
or
french
never
heard
of
it
repeated
the
major
he
spoke
in
such
a
surprised
tone
that
his
voice
sounded
gruff
and
loud
and
lloyd
almost
jumped
the
harshness
was
so
unexpected
think
again
child
he
said
sternly
surely
you
have
been
told
at
least
of
your
brave
countrywoman
who
is
at
the
head
of
the
organisation
in
america
who
nursed
not
only
the
wounded
of
your
own
land
but
followed
the
red
cross
of
mercy
on
many
foreign
oh
a
hospital
nurse
said
lloyd
wrinkling
her
forehead
and
trying
to
think
miss
alcott
was
one
everybody
knows
about
her
and
her
sketches
are
lovely
no
no
exclaimed
the
major
impatiently
lloyd
feeling
from
his
tone
that
ignorance
on
this
subject
was
something
he
could
not
excuse
tried
again
i
heard
of
florence
nightingale
in
one
of
my
books
at
home
a
i
think
there
is
a
picture
of
her
going
through
a
hospital
ward
mothah
told
me
how
good
she
was
to
the
soldiahs
and
how
they
loved
her
they
even
kissed
her
shadow
on
the
wall
as
she
passed
they
were
so
grateful
ah
yes
murmured
the
old
man
florence
nightingale
will
live
long
in
song
and
story
an
angel
of
mercy
she
was
through
all
the
horrors
of
the
crimean
war
but
she
was
an
english
woman
my
dear
the
one
i
mean
is
an
american
and
her
name
ought
to
go
down
in
history
with
the
bravest
of
its
patriots
and
the
most
honoured
of
its
benefactors
i
learned
to
know
her
first
in
that
long
siege
at
strasburg
she
nursed
me
there
and
i
have
followed
her
career
with
grateful
interest
ever
since
noting
with
admiration
all
that
she
has
done
for
her
country
and
humanity
the
world
over
if
america
ever
writes
a
woman
name
in
her
temple
of
fame
dear
child
i
say
it
with
uncovered
head
that
one
should
be
the
name
of
the
old
soldier
lifted
his
hat
as
he
spoke
and
replaced
it
so
solemnly
that
lloyd
felt
very
uncomfortable
as
if
she
were
in
some
way
to
blame
for
not
knowing
and
admiring
this
red
cross
nurse
of
whom
she
had
never
heard
her
face
flushed
and
much
embarrassed
she
drew
the
toe
of
her
slipper
along
hero
back
answering
in
an
abused
tone
but
majah
how
could
i
be
expected
to
know
anything
about
her
there
is
nothing
in
ou
and
nobody
told
me
and
papa
jack
wo
let
me
read
the
newspapahs
they
so
full
of
horrible
murdahs
and
things
so
how
could
i
evah
find
out
i
could
learn
in
twelve
yeahs
and
that
all
the
longah
i
lived
the
major
laughed
forgive
me
little
one
he
cried
seeing
the
distress
and
embarrassment
in
her
face
a
thousand
pardons
the
fault
is
not
yours
but
your
country
that
it
has
not
taught
its
children
to
honour
its
benefactor
as
she
deserves
i
am
glad
that
it
has
been
given
to
me
to
tell
you
the
story
of
one
of
the
most
beautiful
things
that
ever
happened
in
switzerland
the
founding
of
the
red
cross
you
will
remember
it
with
greater
interest
i
am
sure
because
while
i
talk
the
cross
of
the
swiss
flag
floats
over
us
and
it
was
here
in
this
old
town
of
geneva
the
merciful
work
had
its
beginning
lloyd
settled
herself
to
listen
still
stroking
hero
back
with
her
slipper
toe
he
was
my
friend
henri
durant
and
in
the
old
days
of
chivalry
they
would
have
made
him
knight
for
the
noble
thought
that
sprang
to
flower
in
his
heart
and
to
fruitage
in
so
worthy
a
deed
he
was
travelling
in
italy
years
ago
and
happening
to
be
near
the
place
where
the
battle
of
solferino
was
fought
he
was
so
touched
by
the
sufferings
of
the
wounded
that
he
stopped
to
help
care
for
them
in
the
hospitals
the
sights
he
saw
there
were
horrible
the
wounded
men
could
not
be
cared
for
properly
they
died
by
the
hundreds
because
there
were
not
enough
nurses
and
surgeons
and
food
it
moved
him
to
write
a
book
which
was
translated
into
several
languages
people
of
many
countries
became
interested
and
were
aroused
to
a
desire
to
do
something
to
relieve
the
deadly
consequences
of
war
then
he
called
a
meeting
of
all
the
nations
of
europe
that
was
over
thirty
years
ago
sixteen
of
the
great
powers
sent
men
to
represent
them
they
met
here
in
geneva
and
signed
a
treaty
one
by
one
other
countries
followed
their
example
until
now
forty
governments
are
pledged
to
keep
the
promises
of
the
red
cross
they
chose
that
as
their
flag
in
compliment
to
switzerland
where
the
movement
was
started
you
see
they
are
the
same
except
that
the
colours
are
reversed
now
according
to
that
treaty
wherever
the
red
cross
goes
on
sea
or
on
land
it
means
peace
and
safety
for
the
wounded
soldiers
in
the
midst
of
the
bloodiest
battle
no
matter
who
is
hurt
turk
or
russian
japanese
or
spaniard
armenian
or
arab
he
is
bound
to
be
protected
and
cared
for
no
nurse
surgeon
or
ambulance
bearing
that
red
cross
can
be
fired
upon
they
are
allowed
to
pass
wherever
they
are
needed
before
the
nations
joined
in
that
treaty
the
worst
horror
of
war
was
the
fate
of
a
wounded
soldier
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
better
a
thousand
times
to
be
killed
in
battle
than
to
be
taken
prisoner
think
of
being
left
bleeding
and
faint
on
an
enemy
field
till
your
clothes
to
the
and
no
one
merciful
enough
to
give
you
a
crust
of
bread
or
a
drop
of
water
think
of
the
dying
piled
with
the
dead
and
left
to
the
pitiless
rays
of
a
scorching
tropic
sun
that
can
never
happen
again
thank
heaven
in
time
of
peace
money
and
supplies
are
gathered
and
stored
by
each
country
ready
for
use
at
the
first
signal
of
war
to
show
her
approval
the
empress
became
the
head
of
the
branch
in
germany
soon
after
the
war
began
and
then
her
only
daughter
the
grand
duchess
louise
of
baden
turned
all
her
beautiful
castles
into
military
hospitals
and
went
herself
to
superintend
the
work
of
relief
your
country
did
not
join
with
us
at
first
you
were
having
a
terrible
war
at
home
the
one
in
which
your
grandfather
fought
all
this
time
clara
barton
was
with
the
soldiers
on
their
bloodiest
when
you
go
home
ask
your
grandfather
about
the
battles
of
bull
run
and
antietam
fredericksburg
and
the
wilderness
she
was
there
she
stood
the
strain
of
nursing
in
sixteen
such
awful
places
going
from
cot
to
cot
among
the
thousands
of
wounded
comforting
the
dying
and
dragging
many
a
man
back
from
the
very
grave
by
her
untiring
unselfish
devotion
when
the
war
was
over
she
spent
four
years
searching
for
the
soldiers
reported
missing
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
pitiful
letters
came
to
her
giving
name
regiment
and
company
of
some
son
or
husband
or
brother
who
had
marched
away
to
the
wars
and
never
returned
these
names
could
not
be
found
among
the
lists
of
the
killed
they
were
simply
reported
as
whether
dead
or
a
deserter
no
one
could
tell
she
had
spent
weeks
at
andersonville
the
summer
after
the
war
identifying
and
marking
the
graves
there
she
marked
over
twelve
thousand
so
when
these
letters
came
imploring
her
aid
she
began
the
search
visiting
the
old
prisons
and
trenches
and
hospitals
until
she
removed
from
twenty
thousand
names
the
possible
suspicion
that
the
men
who
bore
them
had
been
deserters
no
wonder
that
she
came
to
europe
completely
broken
down
in
health
so
exhausted
by
her
long
severe
labours
that
her
physicians
told
her
she
must
rest
several
years
but
hardly
was
she
settled
here
in
switzerland
when
the
war
broke
out
and
the
red
cross
sought
her
aid
knowing
how
valuable
her
long
experience
in
nursing
would
be
to
them
she
could
not
refuse
their
appeals
and
once
more
started
in
the
wake
of
powder
smoke
and
cannon
roar
but
i
not
start
on
that
chapter
of
her
life
for
if
i
did
i
would
not
know
where
to
stop
it
was
there
i
met
her
there
she
nursed
me
back
to
life
then
i
learned
to
appreciate
her
devotion
to
the
cause
of
humankind
this
second
long
siege
against
suffering
made
her
an
invalid
for
many
years
the
other
nations
wondered
why
america
refused
to
join
them
in
their
humane
work
all
other
civilised
countries
were
willing
to
lend
a
hand
but
clara
barton
knew
that
it
was
because
the
people
were
ignorant
of
its
real
purpose
that
they
did
not
join
the
alliance
and
she
promised
that
she
would
devote
the
remainder
of
her
life
if
need
be
to
showing
america
that
as
long
as
she
refused
to
sign
that
treaty
she
was
standing
on
a
level
with
barbarous
and
heathen
countries
for
years
she
was
too
ill
to
push
the
work
she
had
set
for
herself
when
her
strength
at
last
returned
she
had
to
learn
to
walk
at
last
however
she
succeeded
america
signed
the
treaty
then
through
her
efforts
the
american
national
red
cross
was
organised
she
was
made
president
of
it
while
no
war
until
lately
has
called
for
its
services
the
red
cross
has
found
plenty
to
do
in
times
of
great
national
calamities
you
have
had
terrible
fires
and
floods
cyclones
and
scourges
of
yellow
fever
then
too
it
has
taken
relief
to
turkey
and
lately
has
found
work
in
cuba
i
know
that
you
would
like
to
look
into
miss
barton
old
emperor
william
himself
gave
her
the
iron
cross
of
prussia
the
grand
duke
and
duchess
of
baden
sent
her
the
gold
cross
of
remembrance
medals
and
decorations
from
many
sovereigns
are
there
the
queen
of
servia
the
sultan
of
turkey
the
prince
of
armenia
never
has
any
american
woman
been
so
loved
and
honoured
abroad
and
never
has
an
american
woman
been
more
worthy
of
respect
at
home
it
must
be
a
great
joy
to
her
now
as
she
sits
in
the
evening
of
life
to
count
her
jewels
of
remembrance
and
feel
that
she
has
done
so
much
to
win
the
gratitude
of
her
fellow
creatures
you
came
to
visit
switzerland
because
it
is
the
home
of
many
heroes
but
let
me
tell
you
my
child
this
little
republic
has
more
to
show
the
world
than
its
william
tell
chapels
and
its
lion
of
lucerne
as
long
as
the
old
town
of
geneva
stands
the
world
will
not
forget
that
here
was
given
a
universal
banner
of
peace
and
here
was
signed
its
greatest
treaty
the
treaty
of
the
red
cross
as
the
major
stopped
the
little
colonel
looked
up
at
the
white
cross
floating
above
the
pier
and
then
down
at
the
red
one
on
hero
collar
and
drew
a
long
breath
i
wish
i
could
do
something
like
that
she
exclaimed
earnestly
i
used
to
wish
that
i
could
go
out
like
joan
of
arc
to
do
some
great
thing
that
would
make
people
write
books
about
me
and
carve
me
on
statues
and
paint
pictures
and
sing
songs
in
my
honah
but
i
believe
that
now
i
rathah
do
something
bettah
than
ride
off
to
battle
on
a
prancin
white
chargah
thank
you
majah
for
tellin
me
the
story
i
goin
for
a
walk
now
may
i
take
hero
a
few
minutes
later
the
two
were
wandering
along
beside
the
water
together
the
little
colonel
dreaming
of
valiant
deeds
that
she
might
do
some
day
so
that
kings
would
send
a
gold
cross
of
remembrance
and
men
would
say
with
uncovered
heads
as
the
old
major
had
done
if
america
ever
writes
a
woman
name
in
her
temple
of
fame
that
one
should
be
the
name
of
lloyd
sherman
little
chapter
vi
the
best
gift
as
the
time
drew
near
for
them
to
move
northward
lloyd
began
counting
the
hours
still
left
to
her
to
spend
with
her
friends
only
two
moah
days
mothah
she
sighed
only
two
moah
times
to
go
walking
with
hero
it
seems
to
me
that
i
say
and
go
away
and
nevah
see
him
again
as
long
as
i
live
he
is
going
with
us
part
of
the
way
answered
sherman
the
major
told
us
last
night
that
he
had
decided
to
visit
his
niece
who
lives
at
zürich
we
will
stop
first
for
a
few
days
at
a
little
town
called
zug
beside
a
lake
of
the
same
name
there
is
a
william
tell
chapel
near
there
that
the
major
wants
to
show
us
and
he
will
go
up
the
rigi
with
us
i
think
he
dreads
parting
with
you
fully
as
much
as
you
do
from
hero
his
eyes
follow
every
movement
you
make
so
many
times
in
speaking
of
you
he
has
called
you
christine
i
know
answered
lloyd
thoughtfully
he
seems
to
mix
me
up
with
her
in
his
thoughts
all
the
time
he
is
so
old
i
suppose
he
is
when
i
as
old
as
he
is
i
wo
want
to
travel
around
as
he
does
want
to
settle
down
in
some
comfortable
place
and
stay
there
from
what
he
said
last
night
i
judge
that
this
is
the
last
time
he
expects
to
visit
that
part
of
switzerland
when
he
was
a
little
boy
he
used
to
visit
his
grandmother
who
lived
near
zug
the
chalet
where
she
lived
is
still
standing
and
he
wants
to
see
it
once
more
he
said
before
he
dies
he
must
know
lots
of
stories
about
the
place
said
lloyd
he
does
he
has
tramped
all
over
the
mountain
back
of
the
town
after
wild
strawberries
followed
the
peasants
to
the
mowing
and
gone
to
many
a
fête
in
the
village
we
are
fortunate
to
have
such
an
interesting
guide
i
wish
that
betty
could
be
with
us
to
hear
all
the
stories
he
tells
us
said
lloyd
beginning
to
look
forward
to
the
journey
with
more
pleasure
now
that
she
knew
there
was
a
prospect
of
being
entertained
by
the
major
usually
she
grew
tired
of
the
confinement
in
the
little
railway
carriages
where
there
were
no
aisles
to
walk
up
and
down
in
and
fidgeted
and
yawned
and
asked
the
time
of
day
at
every
station
during
the
first
part
of
the
journey
toward
zug
the
major
had
little
to
say
he
leaned
wearily
back
in
his
seat
with
his
eyes
closed
much
of
the
time
but
as
they
began
passing
places
that
were
connected
with
interesting
scenes
of
his
childhood
he
roused
himself
and
pointed
them
out
with
as
much
enjoyment
as
if
he
were
a
schoolboy
coming
home
on
his
first
vacation
see
those
queer
little
towers
still
left
standing
on
the
remnants
of
the
old
town
wall
he
said
as
they
approached
zug
the
lake
front
rests
on
a
soft
shifting
substratum
of
sand
and
there
is
danger
when
the
water
is
unusually
low
that
it
may
not
be
able
to
support
the
weight
of
the
houses
built
upon
it
one
day
over
four
hundred
years
ago
part
of
the
wall
and
some
of
the
towers
sank
down
into
the
lake
with
houses
i
have
heard
my
grandmother
tell
of
it
many
a
time
as
she
heard
the
tale
from
her
grandmother
many
lives
were
lost
that
day
and
there
was
a
great
panic
later
in
the
day
some
one
saw
a
cradle
floating
out
in
the
lake
and
when
it
was
drawn
in
there
lay
a
baby
cooing
and
kicking
up
his
heels
as
happily
as
if
on
the
water
were
common
occurrences
he
was
the
little
son
of
the
town
clerk
and
grew
up
to
be
one
of
my
ancestors
grandmother
was
very
fond
of
telling
that
tale
how
the
baby
smiled
on
his
rescuers
and
what
a
fine
pleasant
man
he
grew
up
to
be
beloved
by
the
whole
village
it
has
not
been
much
over
a
dozen
years
since
another
piece
of
the
town
sank
down
into
the
water
a
long
stretch
of
lake
front
with
houses
and
gardens
and
barns
was
sucked
under
how
dreadful
exclaimed
lloyd
with
a
shiver
let
us
go
somewhere
else
papa
jack
she
begged
i
do
want
to
sleep
in
a
place
where
the
bottom
may
drop
out
any
minute
her
father
laughed
at
her
fears
and
the
major
assured
her
that
they
would
not
take
her
to
a
hotel
near
the
water
edge
we
are
going
to
the
other
side
of
the
town
to
an
inn
that
stands
close
against
the
mountainside
the
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
who
has
lived
here
all
his
life
in
spite
of
all
they
said
to
quiet
her
fears
the
little
colonel
was
far
from
feeling
comfortable
and
took
small
pleasure
at
first
in
going
to
see
the
sights
of
the
quaint
little
town
she
was
glad
when
they
pushed
away
from
the
pier
next
morning
in
the
steamboat
that
was
to
take
them
across
the
lake
to
the
william
tell
chapel
she
dreaded
to
return
but
a
handful
of
letters
from
lloydsboro
valley
and
one
apiece
from
betty
and
eugenia
that
she
found
awaiting
her
at
the
inn
made
her
forget
the
shifting
sands
below
her
she
read
and
some
of
them
answered
several
and
then
began
to
look
for
the
major
and
hero
they
were
nowhere
to
be
found
they
went
away
directly
after
lunch
her
father
told
her
to
the
chalet
on
the
mountain
back
of
the
town
you
will
have
to
be
content
with
my
humble
society
he
added
you
ca
expect
to
be
always
escorted
by
titled
soldiers
and
heroes
now
you
teasin
said
lloyd
with
a
playful
pout
but
i
do
wish
that
the
majah
had
left
hero
there
are
so
few
times
left
for
us
to
go
togethah
i
afraid
that
you
look
oftener
at
that
dog
than
you
do
at
the
scenery
and
the
foreign
sights
that
you
came
over
here
to
see
said
her
father
with
a
smile
you
can
see
dogs
in
lloydsboro
valley
any
day
but
none
like
hero
cried
the
little
colonel
loyally
and
i
noticin
the
sights
papa
jack
i
think
there
was
nevah
anything
moah
beautiful
than
these
mountains
and
i
just
love
it
heah
when
it
is
so
sunny
and
still
listen
to
the
tinklin
away
up
yondah
where
that
haymakah
is
climbing
with
a
pack
of
hay
tied
on
his
shouldahs
and
how
deep
and
sweet
the
sounds
down
heah
in
the
valley
as
it
tolls
across
the
watah
the
lake
looks
as
blue
as
the
sapphires
in
mothah
necklace
the
pictuah
it
makes
for
me
is
one
of
the
loveliest
things
that
my
has
unrolled
nobody
could
have
a
bettah
birthday
present
than
this
trip
has
been
the
only
thing
about
it
that
has
made
me
unhappy
for
a
minute
is
that
i
must
leave
hero
and
nevah
see
him
again
he
follows
me
just
as
well
now
as
he
does
his
mastah
the
major
came
back
from
his
long
climb
up
the
mountain
very
tired
it
is
more
than
i
should
have
undertaken
the
first
day
he
said
but
back
here
in
the
scenes
of
my
boyhood
i
find
it
hard
to
realise
that
i
am
an
old
old
man
i
be
rested
in
the
morning
however
ready
for
whatever
comes
but
in
the
morning
he
was
still
much
exhausted
and
came
leaning
heavily
on
his
cane
he
asked
to
be
excused
from
going
up
on
the
rigi
with
them
he
said
that
he
would
stay
at
home
and
sit
in
the
sun
and
rest
they
offered
to
postpone
the
trip
but
he
insisted
on
their
going
without
him
they
must
be
moving
on
to
zürich
soon
he
reminded
them
and
they
might
not
have
another
day
of
such
perfect
weather
for
the
excursion
hero
stood
looking
from
the
major
in
his
chair
to
the
little
colonel
standing
with
her
hat
and
jacket
on
ready
to
start
he
could
not
understand
why
he
and
his
master
should
be
left
behind
and
walked
from
one
to
the
other
wagging
his
tail
and
looking
up
questioningly
into
their
faces
go
if
you
wish
said
the
major
kindly
patting
his
head
go
and
take
good
care
of
thy
little
christine
let
no
harm
befall
her
this
day
the
dog
bounded
away
as
if
glad
of
the
permission
but
at
the
door
turned
back
and
seeing
that
the
major
was
not
following
picked
up
his
hat
in
his
mouth
then
carrying
it
back
to
the
major
stood
looking
up
into
his
master
face
wagging
his
tail
the
major
took
the
hat
and
laid
it
on
the
table
beside
him
no
not
good
friend
he
said
smiling
at
the
dog
evident
wish
to
have
him
go
also
you
may
go
without
me
this
time
call
him
christine
if
you
wish
his
company
come
hero
come
on
called
lloyd
it
all
right
the
major
waved
his
hand
toward
her
saying
go
hero
guard
her
well
and
bring
her
back
safely
the
dear
little
christine
the
name
was
uttered
almost
in
a
whisper
with
a
quick
short
bark
hero
started
after
the
little
colonel
staying
so
closely
by
her
side
that
they
entered
the
train
together
before
the
guard
could
protest
if
he
could
have
resisted
the
appealing
look
in
the
little
colonel
eyes
as
she
threw
an
arm
protectingly
around
hero
neck
he
could
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
refuse
the
silver
that
papa
jack
slipped
into
his
hand
so
for
once
the
two
comrades
travelled
side
by
side
hero
sat
next
the
window
and
looked
out
anxiously
as
the
little
mountain
engine
toiled
up
the
steep
ascent
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
top
it
was
noon
when
they
reached
the
hotel
on
the
summit
where
they
stopped
for
lunch
how
solemn
it
makes
you
feel
to
be
up
so
high
above
all
the
world
said
lloyd
in
an
awed
tone
as
they
walked
around
that
afternoon
and
took
turns
looking
through
the
great
telescope
at
the
valley
spread
out
like
a
map
below
them
how
tiny
the
lake
looks
and
the
town
is
like
a
toy
village
i
thought
that
the
top
of
a
mountain
went
up
to
a
fine
point
like
a
church
steeple
and
that
there
would
be
a
place
to
stand
on
when
you
got
there
seems
that
way
when
you
look
up
at
it
from
the
valley
it
does
seem
possible
that
it
is
big
enough
to
have
hotels
built
on
it
and
lots
and
lots
of
room
left
ovah
when
the
majah
said
to
hero
in
such
a
solemn
way
good
care
of
thy
little
christine
let
no
harm
befall
her
this
day
i
thought
maybe
he
wanted
hero
to
hold
my
dress
in
his
teeth
so
that
i
fall
off
sherman
laughed
and
sherman
said
do
you
know
that
you
are
actually
up
above
the
clouds
what
seems
to
be
mist
rolling
over
the
valley
down
there
like
a
dense
fog
is
really
cloud
in
a
short
time
we
shall
not
be
able
to
see
through
it
oh
oh
cried
the
little
colonel
in
astonishment
really
papa
jack
i
always
thought
that
if
i
could
get
up
into
the
clouds
i
could
reach
out
and
touch
the
moon
and
the
stars
of
i
know
bettah
now
but
i
should
think
i
be
neah
enough
to
see
them
no
answered
her
father
that
is
one
of
the
sad
facts
of
life
no
matter
how
loudly
we
may
cry
for
the
moon
it
is
hung
too
high
for
us
to
reach
and
the
of
the
angels
as
longfellow
calls
the
stars
are
not
for
hands
like
ours
to
pick
but
in
a
very
little
while
i
think
that
we
shall
see
the
lightning
below
us
those
clouds
down
there
are
full
of
rain
they
may
rise
high
enough
to
give
us
a
wetting
so
it
would
be
wise
for
us
to
hurry
back
to
the
hotel
it
is
the
strangest
thing
that
evah
happened
to
me
in
all
my
life
said
lloyd
a
few
minutes
later
as
they
sat
on
the
hotel
piazza
watching
the
storm
below
them
overhead
the
summer
sun
was
shining
brightly
but
just
below
the
heavy
storm
clouds
rolled
veiling
all
the
valley
from
sight
they
could
see
the
forked
tongues
of
lightning
darting
back
and
forth
far
below
them
and
hear
the
heavy
rumble
of
thunder
it
seems
so
wondahful
to
think
that
we
are
safe
up
above
the
storm
look
there
is
a
rainbow
and
there
is
anothah
and
anothah
oh
it
is
so
beautiful
i
glad
it
rained
the
storm
that
had
lasted
for
nearly
an
hour
gradually
cleared
away
till
the
valley
lay
spread
out
before
them
once
more
in
the
sunshine
green
and
dripping
from
the
summer
shower
well
said
the
little
colonel
as
they
started
homeward
aftah
this
i
remembah
that
no
mattah
how
hard
it
rains
the
sun
is
always
shining
somewhere
it
nevah
hides
itself
from
us
it
is
the
valley
that
gets
behind
the
clouds
just
as
if
it
was
puttin
a
handkerchief
ovah
its
face
when
it
wanted
to
cry
it
a
comfort
to
know
that
the
sun
keeps
shining
on
right
on
unchanged
it
was
nearly
dark
when
they
reached
the
little
inn
again
in
zug
the
narrow
streets
were
wet
and
the
eaves
of
the
houses
still
dripping
the
landlord
came
out
to
meet
them
with
an
anxious
face
your
friend
the
old
major
he
said
in
his
broken
english
he
have
not
yet
return
i
fear
the
storm
for
him
was
bad
where
did
he
go
inquired
sherman
i
did
not
know
that
he
intended
leaving
the
hotel
at
all
he
did
not
seem
well
early
after
lunch
was
the
answer
he
say
he
will
up
the
mountain
go
behind
the
town
he
say
that
now
he
vair
old
man
maybe
not
again
will
he
come
this
way
and
one
more
time
already
before
he
die
he
long
to
gather
for
himself
the
alpine
rosen
have
you
had
a
hard
storm
here
asked
sherman
the
landlord
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
spread
out
his
hands
the
vair
worst
madame
many
trees
blow
down
the
lightning
he
strike
a
house
next
to
the
church
of
oswald
and
a
goatherd
coming
down
just
now
from
the
mountain
say
that
the
paths
are
heaped
with
fallen
limbs
and
slippery
with
mud
that
is
why
for
i
fear
the
major
have
one
accident
met
maybe
he
has
stopped
at
some
peasant
hut
for
shelter
suggested
sherman
seeing
the
distress
in
lloyd
face
he
knows
the
region
around
here
thoroughly
however
if
he
is
not
here
by
the
time
we
are
through
dinner
we
organise
a
searching
party
hero
knows
that
something
is
wrong
said
the
little
colonel
as
they
went
into
the
a
few
minutes
later
see
how
uneasy
he
seems
walking
from
room
to
room
he
is
trying
to
find
his
mastah
the
longer
they
discussed
the
major
absence
the
more
alarmed
they
became
as
the
time
passed
and
he
did
not
return
you
know
suggested
lloyd
that
with
just
one
arm
he
could
help
himself
much
if
he
should
fall
maybe
he
has
slipped
down
some
of
those
muddy
ravines
that
the
goatherd
told
about
besides
he
was
so
weak
and
tiahed
this
mawnin
presently
her
face
brightened
with
a
sudden
thought
oh
papa
jack
let
send
hero
i
know
where
the
majah
keeps
his
things
the
flask
and
the
bags
and
the
dog
will
know
as
soon
as
they
are
fastened
on
him
that
he
must
start
on
a
hunt
and
i
believe
i
can
say
the
words
in
french
so
that
he
undahstand
only
yestahday
the
majah
had
me
repeating
them
that
a
bright
idea
answered
her
father
who
was
really
more
anxious
than
he
allowed
any
one
to
see
at
least
it
can
do
no
harm
to
try
i
do
want
any
dessert
may
i
go
now
lloyd
asked
as
she
hurried
up
the
stairs
her
heart
beating
with
excitement
she
whispered
to
herself
oh
if
he
happen
to
be
lost
or
hurt
and
hero
should
find
him
it
would
be
the
loveliest
thing
that
evah
happened
hero
seemed
to
know
from
the
moment
he
saw
the
little
flask
marked
with
the
red
cross
what
was
expected
of
him
all
the
guests
in
the
inn
gathered
around
the
door
to
see
him
start
on
his
uncertain
quest
he
sniffed
excitedly
at
his
master
slipper
which
lloyd
held
out
to
him
then
as
she
motioned
toward
the
mountain
and
gave
the
command
in
french
that
the
major
had
taught
her
he
bounded
out
into
the
gloaming
with
several
quick
short
barks
and
darted
up
the
narrow
street
that
led
to
the
mountain
road
maybe
if
he
had
not
been
with
his
master
that
way
the
day
before
he
might
not
have
known
what
path
to
take
the
heavy
rain
had
washed
away
all
trails
so
he
could
not
trace
him
by
the
sense
of
smell
but
remembering
the
path
which
they
had
travelled
together
the
previous
day
he
instinctively
started
up
that
the
group
in
the
doorway
of
the
inn
watched
him
as
long
as
they
could
see
the
white
line
of
his
silvery
ruff
gleam
through
the
dusk
and
then
going
back
to
the
parlour
sat
down
to
wait
for
his
return
to
most
of
them
it
was
a
matter
of
only
passing
interest
they
were
curious
to
know
how
much
the
dog
training
would
benefit
his
master
under
the
circumstances
if
he
should
be
lost
but
to
the
little
colonel
it
seemed
a
matter
of
life
and
death
she
walked
nervously
up
and
down
the
hall
with
her
hands
behind
her
watching
the
clock
and
running
to
the
door
to
peer
out
in
the
darkness
every
time
she
heard
a
sound
some
one
played
a
noisy
on
the
old
piano
a
young
man
sang
a
serenade
in
italian
and
two
girls
after
much
coaxing
consented
to
join
in
a
high
shrill
duet
laughter
and
a
babel
of
conversation
floated
from
the
parlour
to
the
hall
where
lloyd
watched
and
waited
her
father
waited
with
her
but
he
had
a
newspaper
lloyd
wondered
how
he
could
read
while
such
an
important
search
was
going
on
she
did
not
know
that
he
had
little
faith
in
the
dog
ability
to
find
his
master
she
however
had
not
a
single
doubt
of
it
the
time
seemed
endless
again
and
again
the
little
cuckoo
in
the
hall
clock
came
out
to
call
the
hour
the
quarters
and
halves
at
last
there
was
a
patter
of
big
soft
paws
on
the
porch
and
lloyd
springing
to
the
door
met
hero
on
the
threshold
something
large
and
gray
was
in
his
mouth
oh
papa
jack
she
cried
he
found
him
hero
found
him
this
is
the
majah
alpine
hat
the
flask
is
gone
from
his
collah
so
the
majah
must
have
needed
help
and
see
how
wild
hero
is
to
start
back
oh
papa
jack
hurry
please
her
call
brought
every
one
from
the
parlour
to
see
the
dog
who
was
springing
back
and
forth
with
eager
barks
that
asked
as
plainly
as
words
for
some
one
to
follow
him
oh
let
me
go
with
you
papa
jack
begged
lloyd
he
shook
his
head
decidedly
no
it
is
too
late
and
dark
and
no
telling
how
far
we
shall
have
to
climb
you
have
already
done
your
part
my
dear
in
sending
the
dog
if
the
major
is
really
in
need
of
help
he
will
have
you
to
thank
for
his
rescue
the
landlord
called
for
lanterns
several
of
the
guests
seized
their
hats
and
alpenstocks
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
little
relief
party
was
hurrying
along
the
street
after
their
trusty
guide
with
sherman
in
the
lead
he
had
caught
up
a
hammock
as
he
started
we
may
need
some
kind
of
a
stretcher
he
said
slinging
it
over
his
shoulder
they
trudged
on
in
silence
wondering
what
they
would
find
at
the
end
of
their
journey
the
mountain
path
was
strewn
with
limbs
broken
off
by
the
storm
although
the
moon
came
up
presently
and
added
its
faint
light
to
the
yellow
rays
of
the
lanterns
they
had
to
pick
their
steps
slowly
often
stumbling
hero
bounding
on
ahead
paused
to
look
back
now
and
then
with
impatient
barks
they
had
climbed
more
than
an
hour
when
he
suddenly
shot
ahead
into
the
darkest
part
of
the
woods
and
gave
voice
so
loudly
that
they
knew
that
they
had
reached
the
end
of
their
search
and
pushed
forward
anxiously
the
moonlight
could
not
reach
this
spot
among
the
trees
so
densely
shaded
but
the
lanterns
showed
them
the
old
man
a
short
distance
from
the
path
he
was
pinned
to
the
wet
earth
by
a
limb
that
had
fallen
partly
across
him
fortunately
the
storm
had
been
unable
to
twist
it
entirely
from
the
tree
only
the
outer
end
of
the
limb
had
struck
him
but
the
tangle
of
leafy
boughs
above
him
was
too
thick
to
creep
through
his
clothes
were
drenched
and
on
the
ground
beside
him
beaten
flat
by
the
storm
lay
the
bunch
of
alpine
roses
he
had
climbed
so
far
to
find
he
was
conscious
when
the
men
reached
him
the
brandy
in
the
flask
had
revived
him
and
as
they
drew
him
out
from
under
the
branches
and
stretched
the
hammock
over
some
poles
for
a
litter
he
told
them
what
had
happened
he
had
been
some
distance
farther
up
the
mountain
and
had
stopped
at
a
peasant
hut
for
some
goat
milk
he
rested
there
a
long
time
never
noticing
in
the
dense
shade
of
the
woods
that
a
storm
was
gathering
it
came
upon
him
suddenly
his
head
was
hurt
and
his
back
he
could
not
tell
how
badly
he
had
lain
so
long
on
the
wet
ground
that
he
was
numb
with
cold
but
thought
he
would
be
better
when
he
was
once
more
resting
warm
and
dry
at
the
inn
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
hero
and
feebly
patted
him
a
faint
smile
crossing
his
face
thou
best
of
friends
he
whispered
thou
then
he
stopped
closing
his
eyes
with
a
groan
they
were
lifting
him
on
the
stretcher
and
the
pain
caused
by
the
movement
made
him
faint
it
was
a
slow
journey
down
the
slippery
mountain
path
the
men
who
carried
him
had
to
pick
their
steps
carefully
at
the
inn
the
little
cuckoo
came
out
of
the
clock
in
the
hall
and
called
eleven
half
past
and
midnight
before
the
even
tramp
tramp
of
approaching
feet
made
the
little
colonel
run
to
the
door
for
the
last
time
they
comin
mothah
she
whispered
with
a
frightened
face
and
then
ran
back
to
hide
her
eyes
while
the
men
passed
up
the
steps
with
their
unconscious
burden
she
thought
the
major
was
dead
he
lay
so
white
and
still
but
he
had
only
fainted
again
on
the
way
and
soon
revived
enough
to
answer
the
doctor
questions
and
send
word
to
the
little
colonel
that
she
and
hero
had
saved
his
life
do
you
heah
that
she
asked
of
hero
when
they
told
her
what
he
had
said
the
doctah
said
that
if
the
majah
had
lain
out
on
that
cold
wet
ground
till
mawnin
without
any
attention
it
surely
would
have
killed
him
i
proud
of
you
hero
i
goin
to
get
papa
jack
to
write
a
piece
about
you
and
send
it
to
the
how
would
you
like
to
have
yo
name
come
out
in
a
big
american
newspapah
several
lonely
days
followed
for
the
little
colonel
either
her
father
or
mother
was
constantly
with
the
major
and
sometimes
both
they
were
waiting
for
his
niece
to
come
from
zürich
and
take
him
back
with
her
to
a
hospital
where
he
could
have
better
care
than
in
the
little
inn
in
zug
it
greatly
worried
the
old
man
that
he
should
be
the
cause
of
disarranging
their
plans
and
delaying
their
journey
he
urged
them
to
go
on
and
leave
him
but
they
would
not
consent
sometimes
the
little
colonel
slipped
into
the
room
with
a
bunch
of
alpine
roses
or
a
cluster
of
edelweiss
that
she
had
bought
from
some
peasant
sometimes
she
sat
beside
him
for
a
few
minutes
but
most
of
her
time
was
spent
with
hero
wandering
up
and
down
beside
the
lake
feeding
the
swans
or
watching
the
little
steamboats
come
and
go
she
had
forgotten
her
fear
of
the
bottom
dropping
out
of
the
town
one
evening
just
at
sunset
the
major
sent
for
her
i
go
to
zürich
in
the
morning
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
as
she
came
into
the
room
i
wanted
to
say
while
i
have
the
time
and
strength
we
expect
to
leave
very
early
probably
before
you
are
awake
his
couch
was
drawn
up
by
the
window
through
which
the
shimmering
lake
shone
in
the
sunset
like
rosy
far
up
the
mountain
sounded
the
faint
tinkling
of
and
the
clear
sweet
yodelling
of
a
peasant
on
his
homeward
way
at
intervals
the
deep
tolling
of
the
bell
of
oswald
floated
out
across
the
water
when
the
snow
falls
he
said
after
a
long
pause
i
shall
be
far
away
from
here
they
tell
me
that
at
the
hospital
where
i
am
going
i
shall
find
a
cure
but
i
know
he
pointed
to
an
on
the
table
beside
him
see
the
sand
has
nearly
run
its
course
the
hour
will
soon
be
done
it
is
so
with
me
i
have
felt
it
for
a
long
time
lloyd
looked
up
startled
he
went
on
slowly
i
can
not
take
hero
with
me
to
the
hospital
so
i
shall
leave
him
behind
with
some
one
who
will
care
for
him
and
love
him
perhaps
even
better
than
i
have
done
he
held
out
his
hand
to
the
dog
come
hero
my
dear
old
comrade
come
bid
thy
master
farewell
fumbling
under
his
pillow
as
he
spoke
he
took
out
a
small
leather
case
and
opening
it
held
up
a
medal
it
was
the
medal
that
had
been
given
him
for
bravery
on
the
field
of
battle
it
is
my
one
treasure
murmured
the
old
soldier
turning
it
fondly
as
it
lay
in
his
palm
i
have
no
family
to
whom
i
can
leave
it
as
an
heirloom
but
thou
hast
twice
earned
the
right
to
wear
it
i
have
no
fear
but
that
thou
wilt
always
be
true
to
the
red
cross
and
thy
name
of
hero
so
thou
shalt
wear
thy
country
medal
to
thy
grave
he
fastened
the
medal
to
hero
collar
then
with
the
dog
great
head
pressed
fondly
against
him
he
began
talking
to
him
softly
and
gently
in
french
lloyd
could
not
understand
but
the
sight
of
the
old
soldier
taking
his
last
leave
of
his
faithful
friend
brought
the
tears
to
her
eyes
she
tried
to
describe
the
scene
to
her
mother
afterward
oh
it
was
so
pitiful
she
exclaimed
it
neahly
broke
my
heart
then
he
called
me
to
him
and
said
that
because
i
was
like
his
little
christine
he
knew
that
i
would
be
good
to
hero
and
he
asked
me
to
take
him
back
to
america
with
me
i
promised
that
i
would
then
he
put
hero
paw
in
my
hand
and
said
i
give
thee
to
thy
little
mistress
protect
and
guard
her
always
as
she
will
love
and
care
for
thee
it
was
awfully
solemn
almost
like
some
kind
of
blessing
then
he
lay
back
on
the
pillows
as
if
he
was
too
tiahed
to
say
anothah
word
i
tried
to
thank
him
but
i
was
so
surprised
and
glad
that
hero
was
mine
and
yet
so
sorry
to
say
to
the
majah
that
the
right
words
would
come
i
just
began
to
cry
again
but
i
am
suah
the
majah
undahstood
he
patted
my
hand
and
smoothed
my
hair
and
said
things
in
french
that
sounded
as
if
he
was
tryin
to
comfort
me
aftah
awhile
i
remembahed
that
we
had
been
there
a
long
time
and
ought
to
go
so
i
kissed
him
and
hero
and
i
went
out
leavin
the
doah
open
as
he
told
us
he
watched
us
all
the
way
down
the
hall
when
i
turned
at
the
stairway
to
look
back
he
was
still
watchin
he
smiled
and
waved
his
hand
but
the
way
he
smiled
made
me
feel
worse
than
evah
it
was
so
sad
sherman
went
with
the
major
next
morning
when
he
was
taken
to
zürich
lloyd
was
asleep
when
they
left
the
inn
so
the
last
remembrance
she
had
of
the
major
was
the
way
he
looked
as
he
lay
on
his
couch
in
the
sunset
smiling
and
waving
his
hand
to
her
when
christmastide
came
it
was
as
he
said
he
was
with
his
little
christine
i
can
hardly
keep
from
crying
whenever
i
think
of
him
lloyd
wrote
to
betty
it
was
so
pitiful
his
giving
up
everything
in
the
world
that
he
cared
for
and
going
off
to
the
hospital
to
wait
there
alone
for
his
to
run
out
hero
seems
to
miss
him
but
i
think
he
understands
that
he
belongs
to
me
now
i
can
scarcely
believe
that
he
is
really
mine
and
that
i
may
take
him
back
to
america
with
me
he
is
the
best
thing
that
the
has
given
me
or
ever
can
give
me
we
start
to
lucerne
to
see
the
lion
in
the
rocks
and
from
there
we
go
to
paris
only
a
little
while
now
and
we
shall
all
be
together
i
can
hardly
wait
for
you
to
see
my
lovely
bernard
with
his
red
cross
of
geneva
and
the
medal
that
he
has
earned
the
right
to
wear
chapter
vii
in
tours
a
dozen
times
between
paris
and
tours
the
little
colonel
turned
from
the
car
window
to
smile
at
her
mother
and
say
with
a
wriggle
of
impatience
oh
i
ca
to
get
there
wo
betty
and
eugenia
be
surprised
to
see
us
two
whole
days
earlier
than
they
expected
but
you
must
count
too
much
on
seeing
them
at
the
hotel
the
minute
we
arrive
her
mother
cautioned
her
you
know
cousin
carl
wrote
that
they
were
making
excursions
every
day
to
the
old
châteaux
near
there
and
i
think
it
quite
probable
they
will
be
away
so
do
set
your
heart
on
seeing
them
before
night
some
of
those
trips
take
two
days
lloyd
turned
to
the
window
again
and
tried
to
busy
herself
with
the
scenes
flying
past
the
peasant
women
with
handkerchiefs
over
their
heads
and
the
men
in
blue
cotton
blouses
and
wooden
shoes
at
work
in
the
fields
the
and
the
vineyards
the
that
dogs
helped
to
draw
it
was
all
as
joyce
had
described
it
to
her
and
she
pinched
herself
to
make
sure
that
she
was
awake
and
actually
in
france
speeding
along
toward
the
gate
of
the
giant
scissors
and
all
the
delightful
foreign
experience
that
joyce
had
talked
about
she
had
dreamed
many
about
this
journey
but
the
thought
that
was
giving
her
most
pleasure
now
was
not
that
these
dreams
were
at
last
coming
true
but
that
in
a
very
short
time
she
would
be
face
to
face
with
betty
and
eugenia
it
was
noon
when
they
reached
tours
and
went
rattling
up
to
the
hotel
bordeaux
in
the
big
omnibus
at
first
lloyd
was
disposed
to
find
fault
with
the
quaint
hotel
which
cousin
carl
had
chosen
as
their
it
had
no
conveniences
like
the
modern
ones
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
there
was
not
even
an
elevator
in
it
she
looked
in
dismay
at
the
steep
spiral
stairway
winding
around
and
around
in
the
end
of
the
hall
like
the
steps
in
the
tower
of
a
lighthouse
on
a
side
table
in
the
hall
several
long
rows
of
candles
with
snuffers
suggested
the
kind
of
light
they
would
have
in
their
bedrooms
but
everything
was
spotlessly
clean
and
the
landlady
and
her
daughter
came
out
to
meet
them
with
an
air
of
giving
them
a
welcome
home
which
extended
even
to
the
dog
after
their
hospitable
reception
of
hero
lloyd
had
no
more
fault
to
find
she
knew
that
at
no
modern
hotel
would
he
have
been
treated
so
considerately
and
given
the
liberty
of
the
house
since
he
was
not
banished
to
the
courtyard
or
turned
over
to
a
porter
care
she
was
willing
to
climb
a
dozen
spiral
stairways
or
grope
her
way
through
the
of
a
bedroom
every
night
while
they
were
in
france
for
the
sake
of
having
hero
free
to
come
and
go
as
he
pleased
come
on
she
cried
gaily
to
her
mother
as
a
porter
with
a
trunk
on
his
shoulder
led
the
way
up
the
spiral
stairs
it
makes
me
think
of
the
old
song
you
used
to
sing
me
about
the
spidah
and
the
fly
way
into
my
pahlah
is
up
a
winding
stair
nobody
but
a
circus
acrobat
could
run
up
the
whole
flight
without
getting
dizzy
it
a
good
thing
we
are
only
goin
to
the
next
floah
she
ran
around
several
circles
of
steps
and
then
paused
to
look
back
at
her
mother
who
was
waiting
for
sherman
helping
arm
the
elephant
now
goes
round
and
round
when
the
band
begins
to
play
quoted
lloyd
looking
down
on
them
her
face
dimpling
with
laughter
look
out
piped
a
shrill
voice
far
above
her
i
coming
lloyd
gave
a
hasty
glance
upward
to
the
top
floor
and
drew
back
against
the
wall
for
down
the
banister
with
the
speed
of
a
runaway
engine
came
sliding
a
small
boy
around
and
around
the
dizzy
spiral
he
went
hugging
the
railing
closely
and
bringing
up
with
a
tremendous
bump
against
the
newel
post
at
the
bottom
hullo
he
said
coolly
looking
up
at
the
little
colonel
it
she
exclaimed
in
amazement
henderson
sattawhite
of
all
people
how
did
you
get
heah
but
the
boy
had
no
time
to
waste
in
talking
he
stuck
his
thumb
in
his
mouth
looked
at
her
an
instant
and
then
climbing
down
from
the
banister
started
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
as
fast
as
his
short
legs
could
carry
him
for
another
downward
spin
lloyd
waited
for
her
mother
to
come
up
to
the
step
on
which
she
stood
and
then
said
with
a
look
of
concern
do
you
suppose
they
are
all
heah
an
all
of
them
and
that
howl
will
follow
me
around
as
he
did
on
shipboard
beggin
for
stories
it
will
spoil
all
my
fun
with
the
girls
if
he
does
trouble
trouble
till
trouble
troubles
you
said
her
father
playfully
pinching
her
cheek
you
find
it
easier
to
escape
persecution
on
land
than
on
shipboard
henny
did
seem
at
all
anxious
to
renew
his
acquaintance
with
you
he
evidently
finds
sliding
down
bannisters
more
to
his
taste
maybe
howell
has
found
something
equally
interesting
i
certainly
hope
so
said
lloyd
running
on
to
their
rooms
at
the
end
of
the
hall
the
casement
window
in
her
room
looked
out
over
a
broad
bouleyard
down
the
middle
of
which
went
a
double
row
of
trees
shading
a
strip
of
grass
where
benches
were
set
at
intervals
lloyd
leaned
out
to
look
and
listen
a
company
of
soldiers
was
marching
up
the
street
in
the
gay
red
and
blue
of
their
french
uniforms
to
the
music
of
a
band
a
group
of
girls
from
a
convent
school
passed
by
then
some
nuns
she
stood
there
a
long
time
finding
the
panorama
that
passed
her
window
so
interesting
that
she
forgot
how
time
was
passing
until
her
mother
called
to
her
that
they
were
going
down
to
lunch
i
like
it
heah
evah
so
much
she
announced
as
she
followed
her
father
and
mother
into
the
did
you
ask
in
the
office
papa
jack
when
the
girls
would
be
back
yes
they
have
gone
to
amboise
they
will
be
home
before
dark
i
am
sorry
you
missed
taking
that
trip
with
them
lloyd
it
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
châteaux
around
here
in
my
opinion
mary
queen
of
scots
went
there
a
bride
there
she
was
forced
to
watch
the
hugenots
being
thrown
over
into
the
river
leonardo
da
vinci
is
buried
there
and
charles
viii
was
killed
there
by
bumping
his
head
against
a
low
doorway
oh
deah
sighed
the
little
colonel
my
head
is
all
in
a
tangle
there
so
many
spots
to
remembah
every
time
you
turn
around
you
bump
into
something
you
ought
to
remembah
because
some
great
man
was
bawn
there
or
died
there
or
did
something
wondahful
there
it
would
be
lots
easiah
for
travellers
in
europe
if
there
was
so
many
monuments
to
smaht
people
who
must
i
remembah
in
tours
balzac
said
her
father
laughing
the
great
french
novelist
but
that
will
not
be
hard
there
is
a
statue
of
him
on
one
of
the
principal
streets
and
after
you
have
passed
him
every
day
for
a
week
you
will
think
of
him
as
an
old
acquaintance
then
this
is
the
scene
of
one
of
scott
novels
durward
and
the
good
martin
lived
here
there
is
a
church
to
his
memory
he
is
the
patron
saint
of
the
place
at
the
châteaux
you
will
get
into
a
tangle
of
history
for
their
chief
interest
is
their
associations
with
the
old
court
life
where
is
hero
asked
sherman
suddenly
changing
the
conversation
he
in
the
pahlah
stretched
out
on
a
rug
answered
lloyd
it
cool
and
quiet
in
there
with
the
blinds
down
the
landlady
daughtah
said
no
one
went
in
there
often
in
the
middle
of
the
day
so
nobody
would
disturb
him
and
he
not
disturb
anybody
he
all
tiahed
out
comin
so
far
on
the
cars
may
i
go
walkin
with
him
aftah
awhile
mothah
sherman
looked
at
her
husband
questioningly
oh
it
perfectly
safe
he
answered
she
could
go
alone
here
as
well
as
in
lloydsboro
valley
and
with
hero
she
could
have
nothing
to
fear
i
want
you
to
rest
awhile
first
said
sherman
at
four
you
may
go
leaving
hero
comfortably
stretched
out
asleep
in
the
parlour
lloyd
went
back
to
her
room
she
lay
down
for
a
few
minutes
across
the
bed
and
closed
her
eyes
but
she
could
not
sleep
with
so
many
interesting
sights
in
the
street
below
presently
she
tiptoed
to
the
window
and
sat
looking
out
until
she
heard
her
mother
moving
around
in
the
next
room
she
knew
then
that
she
had
had
her
nap
and
was
unpacking
the
trunks
mothah
called
lloyd
i
want
to
put
on
my
prettiest
white
embroidered
dress
and
my
rosebud
sash
because
i
meet
cousin
carl
and
the
girls
that
is
just
what
i
have
unpacked
for
you
said
her
mother
come
in
and
i
help
you
dress
half
an
hour
later
it
was
a
very
fresh
and
dainty
picture
that
smiled
back
at
lloyd
from
the
mirror
of
her
she
shook
out
her
crisp
white
skirts
gave
the
rosebud
sash
an
admiring
pat
and
turned
her
head
for
another
view
of
the
big
leghorn
hat
with
its
stylish
rosettes
of
white
chiffon
then
she
started
down
the
hall
toward
the
spiral
stairway
it
was
a
narrow
hall
with
several
cross
passages
and
at
one
of
them
she
paused
wondering
if
it
did
not
lead
to
eugenia
and
betty
rooms
to
her
speechless
surprise
a
door
popped
open
and
a
cupful
of
water
was
dashed
full
in
her
face
spluttering
and
angry
she
drew
back
in
time
to
avoid
another
cupful
which
came
flying
through
the
transom
above
the
same
door
retreating
still
farther
down
the
passage
and
wiping
her
face
as
she
went
she
kept
her
gaze
on
the
door
walking
backward
in
order
to
do
so
another
cupful
came
splashing
out
into
the
hall
through
the
transom
a
boy
tiptoeing
up
to
the
door
dodged
back
so
quickly
that
not
a
drop
touched
him
then
with
a
long
squirt
gun
that
he
carried
he
knelt
before
the
keyhole
and
sent
a
stream
of
water
squirting
through
it
it
was
howell
there
was
a
scream
from
the
bedroom
fidelia
voice
stop
that
you
hateful
boy
i
tell
mamma
you
nearly
put
my
eye
out
a
muffled
giggle
and
a
scamper
of
feet
down
the
hall
was
the
only
answer
fidelia
threw
open
the
door
and
looked
out
a
water
pitcher
in
her
hand
she
stopped
in
amazement
at
sight
of
the
little
colonel
who
was
waiting
for
a
chance
to
dodge
down
the
hall
past
the
dangerous
door
into
the
main
passage
for
mercy
sakes
exclaimed
fidelia
when
did
come
in
time
fo
yoah
watah
fight
answered
the
indignant
little
colonel
shaking
out
her
wet
handkerchief
she
was
thoroughly
provoked
for
the
front
of
her
fresh
white
dress
was
drenched
and
the
dainty
rosebud
sash
streaked
with
water
fidelia
laughed
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
caught
the
ducking
i
meant
for
howl
she
exclaimed
well
if
that
is
a
joke
it
the
funniest
thing
i
ever
heard
of
putting
the
pitcher
on
the
floor
and
clasping
her
hands
to
her
sides
she
laughed
until
she
had
to
lean
against
the
wall
it
moah
bad
mannahs
than
a
joke
retorted
lloyd
angered
more
by
the
laugh
than
she
had
been
by
the
wetting
a
girl
as
old
as
you
ought
to
go
travellin
till
you
know
how
to
behave
in
a
hotel
i
wondah
that
wherevah
you
go
people
say
those
dreadful
american
children
it
is
so
they
do
say
it
snapped
fidelia
i
got
just
as
good
manners
as
you
have
anyhow
and
i
throw
this
whole
pitcher
of
water
on
you
if
you
say
another
word
she
caught
it
up
threateningly
you
just
cried
the
little
colonel
her
eyes
flashing
and
her
cheeks
flushing
not
for
years
had
she
been
so
angry
she
wanted
to
scream
and
pull
fidelia
hair
with
savage
fingers
she
wanted
to
bump
her
head
against
the
wall
again
and
again
but
with
an
effort
so
great
that
it
made
her
tremble
she
controlled
herself
and
stood
looking
steadily
at
fidelia
without
a
word
i
must
speak
she
kept
saying
desperately
to
herself
i
speak
or
my
tempah
will
get
away
with
me
i
might
claw
her
eyes
out
i
wish
i
could
oh
i
i
could
her
teeth
were
set
tightly
together
and
her
hands
were
clenched
fidelia
met
her
angry
gaze
unflinchingly
for
an
instant
and
then
with
a
contemptuous
pooh
raised
the
pitcher
and
gave
it
a
lurch
forward
it
was
so
heavy
that
it
turned
in
her
hands
and
instead
of
drenching
lloyd
its
contents
deluged
fanchette
who
suddenly
came
out
of
the
door
beside
lloyd
with
the
thousand
dollar
poodle
in
her
arms
poor
beauty
gave
an
injured
yelp
and
fidelia
drew
back
and
slammed
the
door
locking
it
hastily
she
knew
that
the
maid
would
hurry
to
her
mistress
while
he
was
still
shivering
and
that
there
would
be
an
uncomfortable
account
to
settle
by
and
by
howell
who
had
crept
up
to
watch
the
fuss
doubled
himself
with
laughter
it
amused
him
even
more
than
it
had
fidelia
that
he
had
escaped
the
water
and
lloyd
had
caught
it
in
his
stead
lloyd
swept
past
him
without
a
word
and
ran
to
her
mother
room
so
angry
that
she
could
not
keep
the
tears
back
while
telling
her
grievance
what
that
horrid
sattawhite
girl
has
done
she
cried
holding
out
her
limp
wet
skirts
and
streaked
sash
with
an
expression
of
disgust
i
just
her
it
was
an
accident
was
it
not
asked
sherman
oh
she
did
know
she
was
throwing
the
watah
on
me
when
she
pitched
it
out
but
she
was
glad
that
it
happened
to
hit
me
she
did
even
say
me
let
alone
say
that
she
was
sorry
and
she
laughed
and
held
on
to
her
sides
and
laughed
again
and
said
what
a
joke
and
that
it
was
the
funniest
thing
that
she
evah
saw
i
think
her
mothah
ought
to
know
what
bad
mannahs
she
got
somebody
ought
to
tell
her
i
told
fidelia
what
i
thought
of
her
and
i
nevah
speak
to
her
again
so
there
sherman
listened
sympathetically
to
her
tale
of
woe
but
as
she
unbuttoned
the
wet
dress
and
lloyd
still
stormed
on
she
sighed
as
if
to
herself
poor
fidelia
why
mothah
said
lloyd
in
an
aggrieved
tone
i
did
that
you
take
her
part
against
me
stop
and
think
a
minute
little
daughter
said
sherman
opening
her
trunk
to
take
out
another
white
dress
lloyd
was
working
herself
up
into
a
white
heat
put
yourself
in
fidelia
place
and
think
how
she
has
always
been
left
to
the
care
of
servants
or
of
a
governess
who
neglected
her
think
how
much
help
you
have
had
in
trying
to
control
your
temper
and
how
little
you
have
had
to
provoke
it
suppose
you
had
howell
and
henderson
always
tagging
after
you
to
tease
and
annoy
you
and
that
i
had
always
been
too
busy
with
my
own
affairs
to
take
any
interest
in
you
except
to
punish
you
when
i
was
exasperated
by
the
tales
that
you
told
of
each
other
would
that
have
made
a
difference
in
your
manners
acknowledged
lloyd
slowly
then
after
a
moment
silence
she
broke
out
again
i
might
have
forgiven
her
if
only
she
had
laughed
at
me
whenevah
i
think
of
that
i
want
to
shake
her
if
i
live
to
be
a
hundred
yeahs
old
i
can
nevah
think
of
fidelia
sattawhite
without
remembahin
the
mean
little
way
she
laughed
what
kind
of
a
memory
are
you
leaving
behind
you
suggested
sherman
touching
the
little
ring
on
lloyd
finger
that
had
been
her
talisman
since
the
house
party
will
it
be
a
road
of
the
loving
heart
lloyd
hesitated
no
she
acknowledged
frankly
of
when
i
stop
to
think
i
do
want
to
leave
that
kind
of
a
memory
for
everybody
i
hate
to
think
that
when
i
died
there
be
even
one
person
who
had
cause
to
say
ugly
things
about
me
even
fidelia
but
just
now
mothah
honestly
when
i
remembah
how
she
i
feel
that
i
must
be
as
mean
to
her
as
she
is
to
me
i
ca
help
it
sherman
made
no
answer
but
turned
to
her
own
dressing
and
presently
lloyd
kissed
her
and
went
slowly
to
find
hero
he
was
no
longer
dreaming
in
peace
two
restless
boys
cooped
up
in
the
narrow
limits
of
the
hotel
and
burning
with
a
desire
to
be
amused
had
discovered
him
through
the
crack
of
the
door
and
immediately
pounced
upon
him
aw
ai
he
nice
exclaimed
henny
stroking
the
shaggy
back
with
a
dirty
little
hand
howl
felt
in
his
blouse
hoping
to
find
some
crumb
left
of
the
stock
of
provisions
stored
away
at
feel
there
henny
he
commanded
backing
up
to
his
little
brother
and
humping
his
shoulders
ai
that
a
cooky
slipped
around
to
the
back
of
my
blouse
put
your
hand
up
and
feel
henny
obligingly
explored
the
back
of
his
brother
blouse
and
fished
out
the
last
cooky
which
they
fed
to
hero
wisht
we
had
some
more
said
howell
as
the
cake
disappeared
henny
you

up
and
see
if

of
beauty

henny
big
enough
to
ride
on
stand
up
old
fellow
and
let
me
get
on
your
back
i
tell
you
a
scheme
cried
howl
you
run
and
get
one
of
mamma
and
we
fix
a
harness
for
him
and
make
him
ride
us
around
the
room
all
right
agreed
henny
trotting
out
into
the
hall
at
the
door
he
met
lloyd
when
she
went
into
the
room
she
found
howell
lying
on
the
floor
burrowing
his
head
into
the
dog
side
for
a
pillow
hero
did
not
like
it
and
shaking
himself
free
walked
across
the
room
and
lay
down
in
another
place
howl
promptly
followed
and
pillowed
his
head
on
him
again
hero
looked
around
with
an
appealing
expression
in
his
big
patient
eyes
once
more
got
up
crossed
the
room
and
lay
down
in
a
corner
howell
followed
him
like
a
teasing
mosquito
do
bothah
him
howl
said
lloyd
do
you
see
that
he
does
like
it
but
he
makes
such
a
nice
soft
pillow
said
the
boy
once
more
burrowing
his
hard
little
head
into
hero
ribs
he
might
snap
at
you
if
you
tease
him
too
much
i
nevah
saw
him
do
it
to
any
one
but
nobody
has
evah
teased
him
since
he
belonged
to
me
is
he
your
dog
asked
howl
in
surprise
yes
answered
lloyd
proudly
he
saved
my
life
one
time
and
his
mastah
anothah
and
that
medal
on
his
collah
was
one
that
was
given
by
france
to
his
mastah
fo
bravery
and
the
majah
gave
it
to
him
because
he
said
that
hero
had
twice
earned
the
right
to
wear
it
tell
about
it
demanded
howl
scenting
a
story
how
did
he
his
question
was
stopped
in
the
middle
by
hero
who
determined
to
be
no
longer
used
as
a
pillow
stood
up
and
gave
himself
a
mighty
shake
walking
over
to
the
sofa
piled
with
cushions
he
took
one
in
his
mouth
and
carrying
it
back
to
howl
dropped
it
at
his
feet
as
if
to
say
there
use
that
i
am
no
sofa
pillow
that
done
he
stretched
himself
out
again
in
the
farthest
corner
of
the
room
and
laid
his
head
on
his
paws
with
a
sigh
of
relief
oh
oh
cried
the
little
colonel
did
you
evah
see
anything
so
as
that
in
all
yo
life
it
the
brightest
thing
i
evah
saw
a
dog
do
he
thought
it
all
out
just
like
a
person
i
wish
papa
jack
could
have
seen
him
do
it
i
goin
to
treat
you
to
something
nice
fo
that
hero
wait
till
i
run
back
and
get
my
purse
anxious
to
make
him
do
something
else
interesting
howl
still
followed
the
dog
he
tickled
his
paws
turned
his
ears
back
and
blew
in
them
and
blindfolded
him
with
a
dirty
handkerchief
lloyd
was
gone
longer
than
she
intended
for
she
could
not
find
her
purse
for
several
minutes
and
she
stopped
to
tell
her
mother
of
performance
with
the
sofa
pillow
when
she
went
into
the
parlour
again
both
boys
were
kneeling
beside
the
dog
their
backs
were
toward
the
door
henderson
had
brought
the
and
they
were
using
it
for
the
further
discomfort
of
the
patient
old
bernard
here
henny
you
sit
on
his
head
commanded
howl
and
i
buckle
his
hind
feet
to
his
fore
feet
so
that
when
he
tries
to
walk
he
wabble
around
and
tip
over
wo
that
be
funny
stop
demanded
lloyd
do
you
do
that
howl
sattawhite
i
told
you
enough
times
to
stop
teasing
my
dog
howl
only
giggled
in
reply
and
drew
the
buckle
tighter
there
was
a
quick
yelp
of
pain
and
hero
trying
to
pull
away
found
himself
fast
by
the
foot
before
howl
could
rise
from
his
knees
the
little
colonel
had
darted
across
the
room
and
seizing
him
by
the
shoulders
shook
him
till
his
teeth
chattered
there
she
said
giving
him
a
final
shake
as
she
pushed
him
away
you
evah
lay
a
fingah
on
that
dog
again
as
long
as
you
live
if
you
do
you
be
sorry
i
do
something
to
you
for
the
second
time
that
afternoon
her
face
was
white
with
anger
her
eyes
flashed
so
threateningly
that
howl
backed
up
against
the
wall
thoroughly
frightened
releasing
hero
from
the
strap
she
led
him
out
of
the
room
and
with
her
hand
laid
protectingly
on
his
collar
marched
him
out
into
the
street
those
tawmentin
sattawhites
she
grumbled
under
her
breath
i
wish
they
were
all
shut
up
in
jail
every
one
of
them
but
her
anger
died
out
as
she
walked
on
in
the
bright
sunshine
watching
the
strange
scenes
around
her
with
eager
eyes
more
than
one
head
turned
admiringly
as
the
daintily
dressed
little
girl
and
the
great
bernard
passed
slowly
down
the
broad
boulevard
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
nurses
and
babies
in
touraine
were
out
for
an
airing
on
the
grass
where
the
benches
stood
between
the
long
double
rows
of
trees
once
lloyd
stopped
to
peep
through
a
doorway
set
in
a
high
stone
wall
within
the
enclosure
a
group
of
girls
in
the
dark
uniforms
of
a
charity
school
walked
sedately
around
arm
in
arm
under
the
watchful
eyes
of
the
attendant
nuns
then
some
soldiers
passed
on
foot
and
a
little
while
after
some
more
dashed
by
on
horseback
and
she
remembered
that
tours
was
the
headquarters
of
the
ninth
army
corps
and
that
she
might
expect
to
meet
them
often
not
till
the
tolling
of
the
great
cathedral
bell
reminded
her
that
it
was
time
to
go
back
to
the
hotel
did
she
think
again
of
howl
and
kenny
and
fidelia
by
that
time
her
walk
had
put
her
into
such
a
pleasant
frame
of
mind
that
she
could
think
of
them
without
annoyance
chapter
viii
with
betty
and
eugenia
when
the
little
colonel
reached
the
hotel
the
omnibus
was
leaving
the
door
to
go
to
the
railroad
station
a
few
blocks
away
thinking
that
betty
and
eugenia
might
be
on
the
coming
train
she
went
into
the
parlour
to
wait
for
the
return
of
the
omnibus
she
had
bought
a
box
of
chocolate
creams
at
the
cake
shop
on
the
corner
to
divide
with
hero
fidelia
had
wandered
down
to
the
parlour
in
her
absence
and
now
seated
at
the
old
piano
was
banging
on
its
yellow
keys
with
all
her
might
she
played
unusually
well
for
a
girl
of
her
age
but
lloyd
had
a
feeling
that
a
public
parlour
was
not
a
place
to
show
off
one
accomplishments
and
her
nose
went
up
a
trifle
scornfully
as
she
entered
then
she
caught
sight
of
herself
in
the
mirror
over
the
mantel
and
her
expression
changed
instantly
for
mercy
sakes
she
said
to
herself
i
look
like
one
of
the
proud
and
haughty
sistahs
in
as
if
i
thought
the
earth
was
good
enough
for
me
to
step
on
it
certainly
is
becoming
and
it
would
make
me
furious
if
anybody
looked
at
me
in
such
a
cool
scornful
way
i
know
that
i
feel
that
way
inside
whenevah
i
talk
to
fidelia
i
wondah
if
she
sees
it
in
my
face
and
that
what
makes
her
cross
and
scratchy
like
a
cat
that
has
had
its
fur
rubbed
the
wrong
way
just
for
fun
i
believe
pretend
to
myself
for
ten
minutes
that
i
love
her
deahly
and
i
smile
when
i
talk
to
her
just
as
if
she
were
betty
and
nevah
pay
any
attention
to
her
mean
speeches
i
give
her
this
one
chance
then
if
she
keeps
on
bein
hateful
i
nevah
have
anything
moah
to
do
with
her
again
so
while
fidelia
played
on
toward
the
end
of
the
waltz
purposely
regardless
of
lloyd
presence
lloyd
sitting
behind
her
looked
into
the
mirror
and
practised
making
pleasant
faces
for
fidelia
benefit
the
music
came
to
a
close
with
a
loud
double
bang
that
made
lloyd
start
up
from
her
chair
with
a
guilty
flush
fearing
that
she
had
been
caught
at
her
peculiar
occupation
before
fidelia
could
say
anything
lloyd
walked
over
to
her
with
the
friendliest
of
her
practised
smiles
and
held
out
the
box
of
chocolate
creams
take
some
she
said
they
are
the
best
i
had
since
i
left
kentucky
thanks
said
fidelia
stiffly
screwing
around
on
the
and
helping
herself
to
just
one
but
feeling
the
warmth
of
lloyd
cordial
tone
urging
her
to
take
more
she
thawed
into
smiling
friendliness
and
took
several
they
are
delicious
she
exclaimed
you
got
them
at
the
cake
shop
on
the
corner
did
you
there
are
two
awfully
nice
american
girls
stopping
at
this
hotel
who
took
me
in
there
one
day
for
some
they
been
in
kentucky
too
the
one
named
elizabeth
lives
there
why
it
must
be
betty
and
eugenia
cried
lloyd
the
very
girls
we
came
here
to
meet
do
know
them
not
very
well
we
only
been
here
a
few
days
but
i
dearly
love
the
one
you
call
betty
she
came
into
my
room
one
night
when
i
had
the
and
brought
a
spice
poultice
and
a
bag
mamma
was
at
a
concert
and
fanchette
was
cross
and
i
was
so
miserable
and
lonesome
i
wanted
to
die
but
elizabeth
knew
exactly
what
to
do
to
stop
the
pain
and
then
she
stayed
and
talked
to
me
for
a
long
time
she
told
me
about
a
house
party
she
went
to
last
year
where
the
girls
all
caught
the
measles
at
a
gypsy
camp
and
she
nearly
went
blind
on
account
of
it
that
was
house
pahty
exclaimed
the
little
colonel
and
my
mothah
is
betty
godmothah
and
betty
is
goin
to
live
at
my
house
all
next
wintah
and
go
to
school
with
me
fidelia
swung
farther
around
on
the
and
faced
lloyd
in
surprise
and
are
the
little
colonel
she
cried
from
what
elizabeth
said
i
thought
she
was
pretty
near
an
angel
fidelia
tone
implied
more
plainly
than
her
words
that
she
wondered
how
betty
could
think
so
a
cutting
reply
was
on
the
tip
of
lloyd
tongue
but
the
sight
of
her
face
in
the
mirror
checked
it
she
only
said
pleasantly
betty
is
certainly
the
loveliest
girl
in
the
world
and
there
she
is
now
interrupted
fidelia
nodding
toward
the
door
as
voices
sounded
in
the
hall
and
footsteps
came
out
from
the
office
oh
they
be
so
surprised
said
lloyd
looking
back
with
a
radiant
face
as
she
ran
toward
the
door
we
came
two
whole
days
earlier
than
they
expected
fidelia
heard
the
joyful
greeting
the
chorus
of
surprised
exclamations
as
lloyd
flew
first
at
betty
then
at
eugenia
with
a
hug
and
a
kiss
then
turned
to
greet
her
cousin
carl
betty
will
never
look
at
me
again
fidelia
thought
with
a
throb
of
jealousy
turning
away
from
the
sight
of
their
happy
meeting
and
beginning
to
strike
soft
aimless
chords
on
the
piano
i
wish
i
were
one
of
them
she
whispered
with
the
tears
springing
to
her
eyes
i
hate
to
be
always
on
the
edge
of
things
and
never
in
them
we
never
stay
in
a
place
long
enough
at
a
time
to
make
any
real
friends
or
have
any
good
times
chattering
and
laughing
and
asking
eager
questions
the
girls
hurried
up
the
stairs
to
sherman
room
almost
a
year
had
gone
by
since
eugenia
and
lloyd
had
parted
on
the
lantern
decked
lawn
at
locust
the
last
night
of
the
house
party
the
year
had
made
little
difference
in
lloyd
but
eugenia
had
grown
so
tall
that
the
change
was
startling
really
you
are
taller
than
i
exclaimed
sherman
in
the
midst
of
an
affectionate
greeting
as
she
held
her
off
for
a
better
view
and
does
she
look
stylish
and
young
ladyfied
with
her
skirts
down
to
her
ankles
added
lloyd
you
nevah
think
that
she
was
only
fifteen
would
you
i
had
to
have
them
made
long
explained
eugenia
much
flattered
by
lloyd
speech
it
was
her
greatest
wish
to
appear
grown
up
papa
says
that
i
am
probably
as
tall
now
as
i
shall
ever
be
and
really
i
look
ridiculous
with
my
dresses
any
shorter
sherman
noticed
presently
with
a
smile
that
eugenia
seemed
to
have
gained
dignity
with
her
added
height
there
was
something
amusingly
patronising
in
her
manner
toward
the
younger
girls
she
answered
lloyd
several
times
with
an
oh
no
child
that
was
almost
grandmotherly
in
its
tone
but
here
is
somebody
who
has
come
back
just
as
sweet
and
childlike
as
ever
thought
sherman
twisting
one
of
betty
brown
curls
around
her
finger
then
she
said
aloud
was
the
trip
as
delightful
as
you
dreamed
it
would
be
my
little
tusitala
oh
godmother
sighed
betty
blissfully
it
was
a
thousand
times
better
and
the
best
of
it
is
my
eyes
are
as
well
as
ever
i
need
be
afraid
now
of
that
night
that
haunted
me
like
a
bad
dream
all
during
dinner
fidelia
kept
looking
across
at
the
merry
party
sitting
at
the
next
table
and
wished
she
could
be
with
them
she
could
not
help
hearing
all
they
said
for
they
were
only
a
few
feet
away
and
there
was
no
one
talking
at
the
table
where
she
sat
the
boys
were
in
the
with
fanchette
and
her
mother
was
spending
the
evening
with
some
friends
at
the
new
hotel
across
the
way
i
going
to
make
believe
that
i
one
of
them
the
lonely
child
said
to
herself
smiling
as
she
caught
a
friendly
nod
from
betty
so
she
listened
eagerly
to
forbes
account
of
their
visit
to
venice
and
to
the
volcano
of
vesuvius
and
laughed
with
the
others
over
the
amusing
experiences
betty
and
eugenia
had
in
norway
with
a
chambermaid
who
could
not
understand
them
and
in
holland
with
an
old
dutch
the
day
they
became
separated
from
forbes
and
were
lost
for
several
hours
fidelia
salad
almost
choked
her
there
was
such
an
ache
in
her
throat
when
she
heard
them
planning
an
excursion
for
the
next
day
she
had
no
one
to
make
plans
with
and
when
she
was
taken
sightseeing
it
was
by
a
french
teacher
more
intent
on
improving
her
pupil
accent
than
in
giving
her
a
happy
time
as
they
were
finishing
their
dessert
sherman
suddenly
remembered
that
he
had
a
letter
in
his
pocket
for
lloyd
which
he
had
forgotten
to
give
her
it
is
from
joyce
she
said
looking
at
the
oh
if
she
were
only
heah
what
a
lovely
time
we
could
have
it
would
be
like
anothah
house
pahty
may
i
read
it
now
at
the
table
mothah
it
is
to
all
of
us
fidelia
almost
held
her
breath
she
was
so
afraid
that
sherman
would
suggest
waiting
until
they
went
to
the
parlour
there
she
could
no
longer
be
one
of
them
no
matter
how
hard
she
might
pretend
she
wanted
the
interesting
play
to
go
on
as
long
as
possible
she
did
not
know
that
she
ought
not
to
listen
there
were
many
things
she
had
never
been
taught
lloyd
began
to
read
aloud
dear
girls
you
will
be
in
tours
by
the
time
this
letter
reaches
you
and
i
am
simply
wild
to
be
there
with
you
oh
if
i
could
be
there
only
one
day
to
take
you
to
all
the
old
places
do
please
go
to
the
home
of
the
sisters
of
the
poor
and
ask
for
sister
denisa
give
her
my
love
and
tell
her
that
i
often
think
of
her
and
do
go
to
that
funny
pie
shop
on
the
rue
nationale
where
everybody
is
allowed
to
walk
around
and
help
themselves
and
keep
their
own
count
and
eat
one
of
those
tiny
delicious
tarts
for
me
they
the
best
in
the
world
i
ca
think
of
anything
else
but
that
walk
which
you
will
be
taking
soon
without
me
i
can
shut
my
eyes
and
see
every
inch
of
the
way
as
it
used
to
look
when
we
went
home
just
after
sunset
there
is
the
river
loire
all
rosy
red
in
the
and
the
bridge
with
the
soldiers
marching
across
it
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
is
the
little
old
village
of
symphorian
with
its
narrow
crooked
streets
how
i
love
every
old
cobblestone
you
will
see
the
fat
old
women
rattling
home
in
their
market
carts
and
hear
the
clang
and
click
of
wooden
shoes
down
the
streets
then
there
be
the
high
gate
of
customs
in
the
old
stone
wall
that
fences
in
the
village
and
the
country
road
beyond
you
climb
the
hill
with
the
new
moon
coming
up
behind
the
tall
lombardy
poplars
and
go
on
between
the
fields
turning
brown
in
the
twilight
till
the
gate
of
the
giant
scissors
looms
up
beside
the
road
like
a
picture
out
of
some
fairy
tale
a
little
farther
on
you
come
to
madame
dear
old
villa
with
the
high
wall
around
it
and
the
laurel
hedges
and
inside
i
wonder
which
of
you
will
have
my
room
with
the
blue
parrots
on
the
oh
i
to
go
back
yet
is
it
strange
when
i
was
there
i
used
to
long
so
for
america
that
many
a
time
i
climbed
up
in
the
at
the
end
of
the
garden
for
a
good
cry
do
forget
to
swing
up
into
that
there
a
fine
view
from
the
top
when
you
see
jules
ask
him
to
show
you
the
goats
that
chewed
up
the
cushions
of
the
pony
cart
the
day
we
had
our
thanksgiving
barbecue
in
the
garden
i
fairly
ache
to
be
with
you
please
write
me
a
good
long
letter
and
tell
me
what
you
are
doing
and
whenever
you
hear
the
nightingales
in
garden
and
the
cathedral
bells
tolling
out
across
the
loire
think
of
your
loving
joyce
let
do
those
things
exclaimed
lloyd
as
she
folded
the
letter
and
slipped
it
back
into
its
envelope
i
do
want
to
waste
time
on
any
old
châteaux
with
the
gate
of
the
giant
scissors
just
across
the
river
that
we
have
seen
yet
i
have
heard
about
that
gate
ever
since
we
left
america
said
forbes
laughingly
nobody
has
taken
the
trouble
to
inform
me
why
it
is
so
important
or
why
it
was
selected
for
a
somebody
owes
me
an
explanation
it
only
an
old
gate
with
a
mammoth
pair
of
scissors
swung
on
a
medallion
above
it
said
sherman
they
were
put
there
by
a
old
man
who
built
the
place
by
the
name
of
joyce
ware
spent
a
winter
in
sight
of
it
and
she
came
back
with
some
wonderful
tale
about
the
scissors
being
the
property
of
a
prince
who
went
around
doing
all
sorts
of
impossible
things
with
them
i
believe
the
girls
have
actually
come
to
think
that
the
scissors
are
enchanted
oh
papa
jack
stop
teasin
said
the
little
colonel
you
know
we
do
if
it
is
really
settled
that
we
are
to
go
there
i
want
to
hear
the
story
said
cousin
carl
i
make
a
practice
of
reading
the
history
of
a
place
before
i
visit
it
so
i
have
to
know
the
story
of
the
gate
in
order
to
take
a
proper
interest
in
it
come
into
the
parlour
said
sherman
rising
betty
will
tell
us
as
she
turned
she
saw
fidelia
looking
after
the
girls
with
wistful
eyes
and
she
read
the
longing
and
loneliness
in
her
face
would
you
like
to
come
too
and
hear
the
fairy
tale
with
us
she
asked
kindly
holding
out
her
hand
a
look
of
happy
surprise
came
over
fidelia
face
and
before
she
could
stammer
out
her
acceptance
of
the
invitation
sherman
drew
her
toward
her
and
led
her
into
the
little
circle
in
one
corner
of
the
parlour
now
we
are
ready
tusitala
said
sherman
settling
herself
on
the
sofa
with
fidelia
beside
her
shaking
back
her
brown
curls
betty
began
the
fairy
tale
that
joyce
cousin
kate
had
told
one
bleak
november
day
to
make
the
homesick
child
forget
that
she
was
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
once
upon
a
time
in
a
far
island
of
the
sea
there
lived
a
king
with
seven
sons
word
for
word
as
she
had
heard
it
betty
told
the
adventures
of
the
princes
the
three
that
were
dark
and
the
three
that
were
fair
and
then
of
the
middle
son
prince
ethelried
to
whom
the
old
king
gave
no
portion
of
his
kingdom
with
no
sword
nothing
but
the
scissors
of
the
court
tailor
he
had
been
sent
out
into
the
world
to
make
his
fortune
even
cousin
carl
listened
with
close
attention
to
the
prince
adventures
with
the
ogre
in
which
he
was
victorious
because
the
grateful
fairy
whom
he
had
rescued
laid
on
the
scissors
a
magic
spell
here
she
said
giving
them
into
his
hands
again
because
thou
wast
persevering
and
fearless
in
setting
me
free
these
shall
win
for
thee
thy
heart
desire
but
remember
that
thou
canst
not
keep
them
sharp
and
shining
unless
they
are
used
at
least
once
each
day
in
some
unselfish
service
after
that
he
had
only
to
utter
his
request
in
rhyme
and
immediately
they
would
shoot
out
to
an
enormous
size
that
could
cut
down
forests
for
him
bridge
chasms
and
reap
whole
wheat
fields
at
a
single
stroke
many
a
peasant
he
befriended
shepherds
and
dames
lords
and
lowly
beggars
and
at
the
last
when
he
stood
up
before
the
ogre
to
fight
for
the
beautiful
princess
kept
captive
in
the
tower
it
was
their
voices
shouting
out
their
tale
of
gratitude
to
him
for
all
these
unselfish
services
that
made
the
scissors
grow
long
enough
and
strong
enough
to
cut
the
ugly
old
ogre
head
off
so
he
married
the
princess
concluded
betty
at
last
and
came
into
the
kingdom
that
was
his
heart
desire
there
was
feasting
and
merrymaking
for
seventy
days
and
seventy
nights
and
they
all
lived
happily
ever
after
on
each
gable
of
the
house
he
fastened
a
pair
of
shining
scissors
to
remind
himself
that
only
through
unselfish
service
to
others
comes
the
happiness
that
is
highest
and
best
over
the
great
entrance
gate
he
hung
the
ones
that
served
him
so
valiantly
saying
those
who
belong
to
the
kingdom
of
loving
hearts
can
ever
enter
here
and
to
this
day
they
guard
the
portal
of
ethelried
and
only
those
who
belong
to
the
kingdom
of
loving
hearts
may
enter
the
gate
of
the
giant
scissors
go
on
said
forbes
as
betty
stopped
what
happened
next
i
want
to
hear
some
more
so
did
joyce
said
betty
she
used
to
climb
up
in
the
and
watch
the
gate
wishing
she
knew
what
lay
behind
it
and
one
day
she
found
out
a
poor
little
boy
lived
there
with
only
the
and
another
servant
the
beat
him
and
half
starved
him
his
uncle
know
how
he
was
treated
for
he
was
away
in
algiers
joyce
found
this
little
jules
out
in
the
fields
one
day
tending
the
goats
and
they
got
to
be
great
friends
she
told
him
this
story
and
they
played
that
he
was
the
prince
and
she
was
the
giant
scissors
who
was
to
rescue
him
from
the
clutches
of
the
ogre
she
made
up
a
rhyme
for
him
to
say
he
had
only
to
whisper
scissors
fearless
friend
hasten
pray
thy
aid
to
lend
and
she
would
fly
to
help
him
she
really
did
too
for
she
played
ghost
one
night
to
frighten
the
old
and
she
told
jules
uncle
when
he
came
back
how
cruelly
the
poor
little
thing
had
been
treated
then
the
little
prince
really
did
come
into
his
kingdom
for
all
sorts
of
lovely
things
happened
after
that
the
gate
had
been
closed
for
years
on
account
of
a
terrible
quarrel
in
the
ciseaux
family
but
at
last
something
joyce
did
helped
to
make
it
up
the
gate
swung
open
and
the
old
brother
and
sister
went
back
to
the
home
of
their
childhood
together
and
it
was
christmas
day
in
the
morning
they
had
been
kept
from
going
through
the
gate
all
those
years
because
the
giant
scissors
would
let
them
pass
only
those
who
belong
to
the
kingdom
of
loving
hearts
can
enter
in
some
day
you
must
put
that
all
in
a
book
betty
said
cousin
carl
when
she
had
finished
when
we
go
to
see
the
gate
i
take
my
camera
and
we
get
a
picture
of
it
now
i
feel
that
i
can
properly
appreciate
it
having
heard
its
wonderful
history
there
was
a
teasing
light
in
his
eyes
that
made
lloyd
say
now
laughin
at
us
cousin
carl
but
it
does
make
any
difference
rathah
see
that
gate
than
any
old
château
in
france
chapter
ix
at
the
gate
of
the
giant
scissors
each
of
the
girls
answered
joyce
letter
but
the
little
colonel
was
the
first
to
find
its
way
to
the
little
brown
house
in
plainsville
kansas
dear
joyce
she
wrote
we
were
all
dreadfully
disappointed
yesterday
morning
when
mother
and
papa
jack
came
back
from
madame
villa
and
told
us
that
she
could
not
let
us
stay
there
she
has
some
english
people
in
the
house
and
could
not
give
us
rooms
even
for
one
night
she
said
that
we
must
be
disappointed
also
about
seeing
jules
for
his
uncle
martin
has
taken
him
to
paris
to
stay
a
month
i
could
have
cried
i
was
so
sorry
ever
since
we
left
home
i
have
been
planning
what
we
should
do
when
we
reached
the
gate
of
the
giant
scissors
i
wanted
to
do
all
the
things
that
you
did
as
far
as
possible
i
was
going
to
have
a
barbecue
for
jules
down
in
the
garden
by
the
pagoda
and
to
have
some
kind
of
a
midsummer
fête
for
the
peasant
children
who
came
to
your
christmas
tree
madame
was
sorry
too
that
she
could
take
us
when
she
found
that
we
were
your
friends
and
she
asked
mother
to
bring
us
all
out
the
next
day
and
have
tea
in
the
pagoda
as
soon
as
mother
and
papa
jack
came
back
they
took
us
to
see
sister
denisa
at
the
home
of
the
little
sisters
of
the
poor
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
her
face
shine
when
we
told
her
that
we
were
friends
of
yours
she
said
lovely
things
about
you
and
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
when
she
told
us
how
much
she
missed
your
visits
after
you
went
back
to
america
next
day
we
went
to
madame
and
she
took
us
over
to
the
ciseaux
place
to
see
jules
désirée
she
is
a
beautiful
old
lady
she
talked
about
you
as
if
you
were
an
angel
or
a
saint
with
a
halo
around
your
head
she
feels
that
if
it
had
been
for
you
that
she
might
still
be
only
among
all
those
paupers
instead
of
being
the
mistress
of
her
brother
comfortable
home
after
we
left
there
we
passed
the
place
where
madame
washerwoman
lives
a
little
girl
peeped
out
at
us
through
the
hedge
madame
told
her
to
show
the
american
ladies
the
doll
that
she
had
in
her
arms
she
held
it
out
and
then
snatched
it
back
as
if
she
were
jealous
of
our
even
looking
at
it
madame
told
us
that
it
was
the
one
you
gave
her
at
the
noel
fête
it
is
the
only
doll
the
child
ever
had
and
she
has
carried
it
ever
since
even
taking
it
to
bed
with
her
she
has
named
it
for
you
madame
said
in
her
funny
broken
english
it
is
a
beautiful
thing
to
leave
such
memories
behind
one
as
mademoiselle
joyce
has
left
i
would
have
told
her
about
the
road
of
the
loving
heart
but
it
is
so
hard
for
her
to
understand
anything
i
say
i
think
you
began
yours
over
here
in
france
long
before
betty
told
us
of
the
one
in
samoa
or
eugenia
gave
us
the
rings
to
help
us
remember
we
took
fidelia
sattawhite
with
us
she
is
the
girl
i
wrote
to
you
about
who
was
so
rude
to
me
and
who
quarrelled
so
much
with
her
brothers
on
shipboard
i
thought
it
would
spoil
everything
to
have
her
along
but
mother
insisted
on
my
inviting
her
she
feels
sorry
for
her
fidelia
acted
very
well
until
we
went
over
to
the
ciseaux
place
but
when
we
got
to
the
gate
she
stood
and
looked
up
at
the
scissors
over
it
and
refused
to
go
in
madame
and
mother
both
coaxed
and
coaxed
her
but
she
was
too
queer
for
anything
she
would
move
a
step
she
just
stood
there
in
the
road
saying
i
wo
go
in
i
do
want
to
i
stay
out
here
and
wait
for
you
no
nothing
anybody
can
say
can
make
me
go
in
down
she
sat
on
the
grass
as
flat
as
humpty
dumpty
when
he
had
his
great
fall
and
all
the
king
horses
and
all
the
king
men
could
have
made
her
get
up
till
she
was
ready
we
could
understand
why
she
should
act
so
she
told
betty
that
night
that
she
was
afraid
to
go
through
the
gate
she
remembered
that
in
the
story
where
the
old
king
and
the
brothers
of
ethelried
came
riding
up
to
the
portal
scissors
leaped
from
their
place
and
snapped
so
angrily
in
their
faces
that
they
turned
and
fled
only
those
who
belong
to
the
kingdom
of
loving
hearts
could
enter
in
she
told
betty
that
she
knew
she
did
belong
to
that
kingdom
for
nobody
loved
her
and
often
she
did
love
anybody
for
days
she
was
afraid
to
go
through
the
gate
for
fear
the
scissors
would
leap
down
at
her
and
she
would
be
so
ashamed
to
be
driven
back
before
us
all
so
she
thought
she
would
pretend
that
she
did
want
to
go
in
she
had
believed
every
word
of
that
fairy
tale
we
had
a
beautiful
time
in
the
garden
we
went
down
all
the
winding
paths
between
the
high
laurel
hedges
where
you
used
to
walk
and
almost
got
lost
they
had
so
many
unexpected
twists
and
turns
the
old
statues
of
adam
and
eve
grinning
at
each
other
across
the
fountain
are
so
funny
we
saw
the
salad
beds
with
the
great
glass
bells
over
them
and
we
climbed
into
the
and
sat
looking
over
the
wall
wondering
how
you
could
have
been
homesick
in
such
an
interesting
place
berthé
served
tea
in
the
pagoda
and
because
we
asked
about
music
madame
smiled
and
sent
berthé
away
with
a
message
pretty
soon
we
heard
his
old
accordeon
playing
away
out
of
sight
in
the
and
then
we
knew
what
kind
of
music
you
had
at
the
noel
fête
sort
of
wheezy
was
it
still
it
sounded
sweet
too
at
that
distance
we
took
hero
with
us
and
he
was
really
the
guest
of
honour
at
the
party
when
madame
saw
the
red
cross
on
his
collar
and
heard
his
history
she
could
do
enough
for
him
she
fed
him
cakes
until
i
thought
he
surely
would
be
ill
it
was
a
red
cross
nurse
who
wrote
to
madame
about
her
husband
he
was
wounded
in
the
war
too
just
as
was
the
major
madame
went
on
to
get
him
and
bring
him
home
and
she
says
she
never
can
forget
the
kindness
that
was
shown
to
her
by
every
one
whom
she
met
when
she
crossed
the
lines
under
the
protection
of
the
red
cross
she
had
met
clara
barton
too
and
while
we
were
talking
about
the
good
she
has
done
madame
said
duchess
of
baden
may
have
sent
her
the
gold
cross
of
remembrance
but
the
grateful
hearts
of
many
a
french
wife
and
mother
will
for
ever
hold
the
rosary
of
her
beautiful
deeds
that
a
lovely
thing
to
have
said
about
one
we
start
to
london
thursday
and
i
write
again
from
there
with
much
love
from
us
all
lloyd
the
long
letter
which
lloyd
folded
and
addressed
after
a
careful
had
not
been
all
written
in
one
day
she
had
begun
it
while
waiting
for
the
others
to
finish
dressing
one
morning
had
added
a
few
pages
that
afternoon
and
finished
it
the
next
evening
at
bedtime
heah
is
my
lettah
to
joyce
mothah
she
said
as
she
kissed
her
good
night
wo
you
look
ovah
it
please
and
see
if
all
the
words
are
spelled
right
i
want
to
send
it
in
the
mawnin
sherman
laid
the
letter
aside
to
attend
to
later
and
forgot
it
until
long
after
lloyd
was
asleep
and
sherman
had
come
then
seeing
it
on
the
table
she
glanced
rapidly
over
the
neatly
written
pages
i
want
you
to
look
at
this
jack
she
said
presently
handing
him
the
letter
it
is
one
of
the
results
of
the
house
party
for
which
i
am
most
thankful
you
remember
what
a
task
it
always
was
for
lloyd
to
write
a
letter
she
groaned
for
days
whenever
she
received
one
because
it
had
to
be
answered
but
when
joyce
went
away
she
said
lloyd
i
know
i
shall
be
homesick
for
locust
and
i
want
to
hear
every
single
thing
that
happens
do
you
dare
send
me
a
stingy
letter
half
of
it
apologising
for
not
writing
sooner
and
half
of
it
promising
to
do
better
next
time
prop
my
picture
up
in
front
of
you
and
look
me
in
the
eyes
and
begin
to
talk
tell
me
all
the
little
things
that
most
people
leave
out
what
he
said
and
she
said
on
the
way
to
the
picnic
and
how
betty
looked
in
her
daffodil
dress
with
the
sun
shining
on
her
brown
curls
write
as
if
you
were
making
pictures
for
me
so
that
when
i
read
i
can
see
everything
you
are
doing
it
was
excellent
advice
and
as
joyce
letters
were
written
in
that
way
lloyd
had
a
good
model
to
copy
joyce
being
an
artist
naturally
makes
pictures
even
of
her
letters
when
betty
went
away
and
began
sending
home
such
accounts
of
her
journey
i
found
that
lloyd
style
improved
constantly
she
wrote
a
dear
little
letter
to
the
major
last
week
telling
all
about
hero
i
was
surprised
to
see
how
prettily
she
expressed
her
appreciation
of
his
gift
sherman
took
the
letter
and
began
to
read
in
two
places
he
corrected
a
misspelled
word
and
here
and
there
supplied
missing
commas
and
quotation
marks
there
was
a
gratified
smile
on
his
face
when
he
finished
that
is
certainly
a
lengthy
letter
for
a
girl
to
write
he
said
in
a
pleased
tone
and
can
not
fail
to
be
interesting
to
joyce
the
letters
she
wrote
me
from
the
cuckoo
nest
were
stiff
short
scrawls
compared
to
this
i
must
tell
my
little
colonel
how
proud
i
am
of
her
improvement
his
words
of
praise
were
not
spoken
however
he
expressed
his
appreciation
later
by
leaving
on
her
table
a
box
of
foreign
correspondence
paper
it
was
of
the
best
quality
he
could
find
in
tours
and
to
lloyd
delight
the
monogram
engraved
on
it
was
even
prettier
than
eugenia
why
did
papa
jack
write
this
on
the
first
sheet
in
the
box
mothah
she
asked
coming
to
her
with
a
sentence
written
in
her
father
big
businesslike
hand
is
no
surer
way
to
build
a
road
of
the
loving
heart
in
the
memory
of
absent
friends
than
to
bridge
the
space
between
with
the
cheer
and
sympathy
and
of
friendly
why
did
papa
jack
write
that
she
repeated
because
he
saw
your
last
letter
to
joyce
and
was
so
pleased
with
the
improvement
you
have
made
answered
sherman
he
has
given
you
a
good
text
for
your
i
paste
it
in
the
top
said
lloyd
then
i
ca
lose
it
is
no
surer
way
she
repeated
to
herself
as
she
carried
the
box
back
to
her
room
bridge
the
space
between
with
the
cheer
and
sympathy
and
there
flashed
across
her
mind
the
thought
of
some
one
who
needed
cheer
and
sympathy
far
more
than
joyce
did
and
who
would
welcome
a
friendly
letter
from
her
with
its
foreign
stamp
as
eagerly
as
if
it
were
some
real
treasure
jessie
nolan
was
the
girl
she
thought
of
an
invalid
with
a
crippled
spine
to
whom
the
dull
days
in
her
wheeled
chair
by
the
window
seemed
endless
and
who
had
so
little
to
brighten
her
monotonous
life
i
write
her
a
note
this
minute
thought
lloyd
with
a
warm
glow
in
her
heart
i
describe
some
of
the
sights
we
have
seen
and
send
her
that
fo
leafed
clovah
that
i
found
at
the
château
yestahday
undah
a
window
of
the
great
hall
where
anne
of
brittany
was
married
ovah
hundred
yeahs
ago
i
do
suppose
jessie
gets
a
lettah
once
a
yeah
when
that
note
was
written
lloyd
thought
of
mom
beck
and
the
pride
that
would
shine
in
the
face
of
her
old
black
nurse
if
she
should
receive
a
letter
from
europe
and
how
proudly
it
would
be
carried
around
and
displayed
to
all
the
coloured
people
in
the
valley
so
with
the
kindly
impulse
of
her
father
text
still
upon
her
she
dashed
off
a
note
to
her
telling
her
of
some
of
her
visits
to
the
palaces
of
bygone
kings
and
queens
eugenia
came
in
as
she
finished
but
before
she
closed
her
desk
she
jotted
two
names
on
a
slip
of
paper
mrs
waters
was
one
she
was
a
little
old
englishwoman
who
did
fine
laundry
work
in
the
valley
and
who
was
always
talking
about
the
edges
in
her
old
english
home
i
write
to
her
from
london
lloyd
thought
if
we
should
get
a
sight
of
any
of
the
royal
family
how
tickled
she
would
be
to
hear
it
the
other
name
was
janet
mcdonald
she
was
a
sad
young
teacher
whom
miss
allison
always
called
her
scotch
lassie
jane
i
suppose
she
care
to
get
a
letter
from
a
little
girl
like
me
thought
lloyd
but
i
know
she
love
to
have
a
piece
of
heather
from
the
hills
near
her
home
i
send
her
a
piece
when
we
get
up
in
scotland
the
letter
that
eugenia
sent
to
joyce
was
only
a
short
outline
of
her
plans
she
knew
that
the
other
girls
had
sent
long
accounts
of
their
trip
through
touraine
so
hers
was
much
shorter
than
usual
papa
has
decided
to
send
me
to
a
school
just
outside
of
paris
this
year
she
wrote
instead
of
the
one
in
new
york
so
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
i
see
my
native
land
again
he
will
have
to
be
over
here
several
months
and
can
spend
christmas
and
easter
with
me
so
i
can
see
him
fully
as
often
as
i
used
to
at
home
it
is
a
very
select
school
madame
recommends
it
highly
and
i
am
simply
delighted
a
new
york
girl
whom
i
know
very
well
is
to
be
there
too
and
we
are
looking
forward
to
all
sorts
of
larks
thursday
we
are
to
start
to
london
for
a
short
tour
of
england
and
scotland
then
the
others
are
going
home
and
papa
and
i
shall
go
by
chester
for
my
maid
poor
old
eliot
has
had
a
glorious
vacation
at
home
she
writes
she
is
to
stay
at
the
school
with
me
we
shall
be
so
busy
until
i
get
settled
that
i
shall
not
have
time
to
write
soon
but
no
matter
how
far
my
letters
may
be
apart
i
am
always
your
devoted
eugenia
chapter
x
on
the
wing
who
is
going
away
asked
lloyd
one
afternoon
of
the
girls
who
were
sitting
in
her
room
manicuring
their
nails
there
goes
a
pile
of
trunks
out
to
the
baggage
wagon
as
she
spoke
a
carriage
drove
up
to
the
door
of
the
hotel
and
fanchette
went
out
with
the
poodle
in
her
arms
the
sattawhites
answered
eugenia
there
howl
and
henny
climbing
into
the
carriage
and
oh
look
girls
there
comes
sattawhite
herself
i
have
had
many
glimpses
of
her
is
she
gorgeous
you
know
they
had
to
leave
she
continued
turning
to
the
girls
i
forgot
to
tell
you
what
happened
early
this
morning
while
you
were
i
was
up
in
my
room
writing
to
joyce
when
i
heard
a
rumble
and
a
running
down
in
the
back
hall
somebody
called
fire
then
somebody
else
took
it
up
and
the
old
gentleman
at
the
end
of
the
hall
who
never
appears
in
public
until
noon
came
bursting
out
of
his
room
in
his
bath
robe
his
shoes
in
one
hand
and
his
false
teeth
in
the
other
it
was
the
funniest
sight
there
was
wild
excitement
for
a
few
minutes
one
woman
began
throwing
things
out
of
the
window
and
another
stood
and
shrieked
and
wrung
her
hands
the
waiter
with
the
long
black
tore
and
grabbed
his
arms
full
of
those
bottles
in
the
racks
you
know
those
bottles
that
have
some
kind
of
chemical
stuff
in
them
there
was
a
strong
smell
of
smoke
and
a
little
puff
of
it
curling
up
from
under
the
stairs
he
threw
all
those
bottles
down
into
the
lower
hall
you
can
imagine
the
smash
there
was
when
they
struck
the
stone
floor
papa
rushed
down
to
investigate
at
the
first
alarm
he
found
that
it
was
only
howl
and
henny
playing
with
a
little
red
wagon
they
had
taken
an
old
flannel
blouse
of
kenny
and
set
fire
to
it
howl
explained
that
they
did
it
because
woollen
rags
make
such
a
nice
thick
smoke
and
last
a
long
time
and
when
they
yelled
fire
they
were
not
to
blame
he
said
if
other
people
did
know
that
they
were
and
went
and
yelled
in
earnest
papa
took
their
part
and
said
that
two
boys
with
as
much
energy
as
they
have
must
find
an
outlet
somewhere
and
that
it
was
no
wonder
that
they
were
restless
cooped
up
in
a
hotel
day
after
day
with
no
amusement
but
their
prim
walks
with
the
maid
and
the
poodle
but
the
old
gentleman
who
had
been
so
frightened
that
he
ran
out
in
public
without
his
teeth
and
the
woman
who
had
thrown
her
toilet
bottles
out
of
the
window
and
broken
them
were
furious
they
complained
to
the
landlord
and
said
that
it
was
not
the
first
offence
the
boys
were
always
annoying
them
so
the
landlord
had
to
go
to
sattawhite
she
found
out
what
the
old
gentleman
said
that
a
mother
who
had
to
go
travelling
around
all
over
europe
giving
her
time
and
attention
to
society
and
a
miserable
poodle
had
better
put
her
children
in
an
orphan
asylum
before
she
started
she
was
so
indignant
that
i
could
hear
her
talking
away
down
in
the
office
she
said
that
she
would
leave
the
instant
that
fanchette
could
get
the
trunks
packed
so
there
they
go
sattawhite
had
sailed
back
to
the
office
during
the
telling
of
eugenia
story
so
their
departure
was
delayed
a
moment
when
she
came
out
again
fidelia
followed
her
sulkily
just
as
they
drove
off
she
looked
up
at
the
open
window
and
saw
the
girls
who
were
waving
then
a
smile
flickered
across
her
sorry
little
face
for
moved
by
some
sudden
impulse
the
little
colonel
leaned
out
and
threw
her
a
kiss
i
suppose
i
nevah
see
her
again
she
said
thoughtfully
as
the
carriage
rolled
around
a
corner
out
of
sight
i
wish
now
that
i
had
been
niceah
to
her
we
may
both
change
evah
so
much
by
the
time
we
are
grown
yet
if
i
live
to
be
a
hundred
i
always
think
of
her
as
the
girl
who
was
so
quarrelsome
that
the
english
lady
groaned
those
dreadful
american
children
and
i
suppose
she
remembah
me
for
the
high
and
mighty
way
i
tried
to
snub
her
whenevah
i
had
a
chance
as
she
spoke
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
a
maid
brought
in
a
package
for
lloyd
oh
look
girls
she
exclaimed
holding
up
a
tiny
pair
of
silver
embroidery
scissors
fidelia
parting
gift
they
were
evidently
something
that
had
been
given
her
for
the
little
silver
sheath
into
which
they
were
thrust
was
beautifully
engraved
in
old
english
letters
with
the
name
around
them
was
wrapped
a
strip
of
rumpled
paper
on
which
was
scrawled
for
you
to
remember
me
by
that
day
you
took
me
to
the
gate
of
the
giant
scissors
was
the
best
time
i
ever
had
poor
little
thing
exclaimed
betty
to
think
that
she
was
afraid
to
go
in
for
fear
that
she
did
belong
to
the
kingdom
and
that
the
scissors
might
leap
down
and
drive
her
back
oh
if
i
had
only
known
sighed
lloyd
remorsefully
i
feel
too
mean
for
anything
if
i
only
believed
that
it
was
because
she
had
been
brought
up
to
know
any
bettah
that
she
acted
so
horrid
and
that
all
the
time
she
really
wanted
to
be
liked
mothah
told
me
i
ought
to
put
myself
in
her
place
and
make
allowances
for
her
but
i
did
want
to
even
try
and
i
nevah
was
nice
to
her
but
once
that
time
i
gave
her
the
candy
then
i
was
only
pretendin
i
cared
for
her
just
for
fun
i
did
want
her
to
go
with
us
to
the
scissahs
gate
that
day
mothah
made
me
invite
her
i
fussed
about
it
i
goin
to
write
to
her
the
minute
i
finish
my
nails
and
tell
her
how
sorry
i
am
that
i
did
leave
a
kindah
memory
behind
me
they
rubbed
away
in
silence
for
a
few
minutes
then
lloyd
spoke
again
i
suahly
have
enough
things
now
to
remind
me
about
the
memory
roads
i
am
tryin
to
leave
behind
me
for
everybody
every
time
i
look
at
this
little
ring
it
says
road
of
the
loving
heart
and
the
scissahs
will
recall
the
fairy
tale
it
was
only
unselfish
service
that
kept
them
bright
and
shining
and
only
those
who
belonged
to
the
kingdom
of
loving
hearts
could
go
in
at
the
gate
then
there
the
red
cross
of
geneva
on
collah
there
could
be
a
moah
beautiful
memory
than
the
one
left
by
all
who
have
that
red
cross
yes
said
betty
holding
up
a
hand
to
inspect
the
pink
finger
nails
now
polished
to
her
satisfaction
and
there
is
the
white
flower
that
the
two
little
knights
of
kentucky
wear
keith
said
that
his
badge
meant
the
same
thing
to
him
that
my
ring
does
to
me
their
motto
is
the
wrong
that
what
the
giant
scissors
always
did
and
that
what
robert
louis
stevenson
tried
to
do
for
the
samoan
chiefs
that
is
why
they
loved
him
and
built
the
road
funny
how
they
all
sing
the
same
song
said
eugenia
it
just
the
same
only
they
sing
it
in
different
keys
after
betty
and
eugenia
had
gone
to
their
rooms
lloyd
sat
a
long
time
toying
with
the
silver
scissors
before
writing
her
note
of
acknowledgment
the
sheath
was
of
hammered
silver
and
around
the
name
was
a
beautifully
wrought
design
of
tiny
clustered
grapes
it
is
one
of
the
prettiest
things
that
my
has
unrolled
she
said
to
herself
and
it
has
certainly
taught
me
a
lesson
poah
little
fidelia
if
i
only
known
that
she
cared
there
were
lots
of
times
that
she
could
have
gone
with
us
and
it
would
have
made
her
so
happy
if
i
had
only
put
myself
in
her
place
when
mothah
told
me
but
i
was
so
cross
and
hateful
i
enjoyed
bein
selfish
now
all
the
bein
sorry
in
the
world
wo
change
things
it
would
be
too
much
like
a
if
this
story
were
to
give
a
record
of
the
next
two
weeks
betty
book
was
filled
down
to
the
last
line
on
the
last
page
and
the
partnership
diary
had
to
have
several
extra
leaves
pasted
inside
the
cover
from
morning
until
night
there
was
a
constant
round
of
sightseeing
the
shops
and
streets
of
london
first
the
abbey
and
the
tower
a
hundred
places
that
they
had
read
about
and
longed
to
see
and
after
they
had
seen
longed
to
come
back
to
for
another
visit
we
can
only
take
a
view
now
and
hurry
on
but
we
must
certainly
come
back
some
other
summer
said
sherman
when
lloyd
wanted
to
linger
in
the
tower
of
london
among
the
armour
and
weapons
that
had
been
worn
by
the
old
knights
centuries
ago
he
repeated
it
when
betty
looked
back
longingly
at
the
poets
corner
in
westminster
abbey
where
the
great
organ
was
echoing
down
the
solemn
aisles
and
again
when
eugenia
begged
for
another
coach
ride
out
to
hampton
court
go
up
and
gay
go
down
to
ring
the
bells
of
london
town
sang
the
little
colonel
i
am
having
such
a
good
time
that
i
like
to
stay
on
right
heah
all
the
rest
of
the
summah
but
she
thought
that
about
nearly
every
other
place
they
visited
windsor
and
warwick
castle
and
shakespeare
birthplace
the
quaint
little
village
on
the
avon
ambleside
where
they
took
the
coach
for
long
rides
among
the
lakes
made
famous
by
the
poets
who
lived
among
them
and
made
them
immortal
with
their
songs
from
these
english
lakes
to
scottish
moors
from
the
land
of
hawthorne
to
the
land
of
heather
from
low
green
meadows
where
the
larks
sang
to
the
highlands
where
plaided
shepherds
watched
their
flocks
they
went
with
enthusiasm
that
never
waned
they
found
the
banks
and
braes
o
bonnie
doon
and
wandered
along
the
banks
of
more
than
one
little
river
that
they
had
loved
for
years
in
song
and
story
have
we
learned
a
lot
exclaimed
eugenia
as
they
journeyed
back
by
rail
to
liverpool
where
the
shermans
and
betty
were
to
take
the
steamer
i
sure
that
i
learned
ten
times
as
much
as
i
would
in
school
this
last
year
and
had
such
a
lovely
time
in
the
bargain
added
lloyd
it
goin
to
make
a
difference
in
the
way
i
study
this
wintah
and
in
what
i
read
if
we
evah
come
ovah
heah
again
i
intend
to
know
something
about
english
history
then
the
places
we
visit
will
be
so
much
moah
interestin
not
spend
so
much
time
on
fairy
tales
and
magazine
stories
i
goin
to
make
my
reading
count
for
something
aftah
this
it
was
dreadfully
mawtifyin
to
find
out
that
i
was
so
ignorant
and
how
much
there
is
in
the
world
to
know
that
i
had
nevah
even
heard
of
that
afternoon
in
the
big
liverpool
hotel
the
trunks
were
packed
for
the
last
time
seems
something
like
the
night
befo
christmas
said
the
little
colonel
as
she
counted
the
packages
piled
on
the
floor
beside
her
trunk
they
were
the
presents
that
she
had
chosen
for
the
friends
at
home
nineteen
twenty
she
went
on
counting
and
that
music
box
for
mom
beck
makes
and
the
souvenir
spoons
for
the
walton
girls
make
oh
i
did
show
you
these
she
said
this
is
allison
she
explained
opening
a
little
box
see
the
caldron
and
the
bells
on
the
handle
i
got
this
in
denmark
that
from
tale
of
the
swineherd
magic
kettle
you
know
kitty
is
from
tam
town
that
why
there
is
a
witch
and
a
broomstick
engraved
on
it
this
spoon
for
elise
came
from
berne
i
think
that
a
darling
little
bear
head
on
the
handle
what
did
you
get
betty
she
continued
turning
to
her
suddenly
you
have
shown
me
a
single
thing
betty
laid
down
the
spoons
she
was
admiring
you
not
think
they
are
worth
carrying
home
she
said
slowly
i
could
buy
handsome
presents
like
yours
you
know
so
i
just
picked
up
little
things
here
and
there
that
would
be
worth
anything
at
all
if
they
had
come
from
famous
places
show
them
to
me
anyhow
persisted
lloyd
betty
untied
a
small
box
it
only
a
handful
of
lava
she
explained
that
i
picked
up
on
vesuvius
but
davy
will
like
it
because
he
thinks
a
volcano
is
such
a
wonderful
thing
here
are
some
pebbles
the
boys
will
be
interested
in
because
i
found
them
on
the
field
of
waterloo
they
are
making
collections
of
such
things
and
waterloo
is
a
long
way
from
the
cuckoo
nest
they
have
any
foreign
things
at
all
i
wanted
to
take
something
nice
to
miss
allison
but
i
could
afford
to
buy
anything
fine
enough
so
i
just
pressed
these
buttercups
that
grew
by
the
gate
of
anne
hathaway
cottage
see
how
sunshiny
and
satiny
they
are
cousin
carl
gave
me
a
photograph
of
the
cottage
and
i
fastened
the
buttercups
here
on
the
side
i
could
offer
such
a
little
gift
to
some
people
but
miss
allison
is
the
kind
that
appreciates
the
thought
that
prompts
a
gift
more
than
the
thing
itself
there
were
a
few
more
photographs
a
handkerchief
for
mom
beck
and
a
string
of
cheap
venetian
beads
for
may
lily
the
most
expensive
article
in
the
collection
was
a
little
mosaic
pin
for
her
cousin
hetty
i
got
that
in
venice
said
betty
cousin
hetty
has
a
single
piece
of
jewelry
to
her
name
and
she
never
gets
any
presents
but
plain
useful
things
so
i
am
sure
she
will
be
pleased
lloyd
turned
away
thinking
of
the
great
contrast
between
her
gifts
and
betty
and
wishing
that
she
had
not
made
such
a
display
of
hers
if
i
were
in
betty
place
she
said
to
herself
i
be
so
jealous
of
me
that
i
could
hardly
stand
it
she
just
a
little
orphan
alone
in
the
world
and
i
have
mothah
and
papa
jack
and
hero
and
tarbaby
for
my
very
own
but
the
little
colonel
need
not
have
wasted
any
sympathy
on
betty
while
one
stowed
away
her
expensive
presents
in
her
trunk
the
other
wrapped
up
her
little
souvenirs
humming
softly
to
herself
it
would
have
been
hard
to
find
anywhere
in
the
queen
dominion
a
happier
child
than
betty
as
she
sat
beside
her
trunk
thinking
of
the
beautiful
journey
with
cousin
carl
just
ending
and
the
life
awaiting
her
at
locust
with
her
godmother
and
the
little
colonel
there
was
only
one
cloud
on
her
horizon
and
that
was
the
parting
with
eugenia
and
her
father
that
last
evening
they
spent
together
in
the
private
parlour
adjoining
sherman
room
early
after
dinner
lloyd
and
her
father
went
down
to
pay
a
visit
to
hero
and
see
that
he
was
properly
cared
for
he
had
had
a
hard
time
since
reaching
england
for
the
laws
regarding
the
quarantining
of
dogs
are
strict
and
it
had
taken
many
shillings
on
sherman
part
and
some
tears
on
the
little
colonel
to
procure
him
the
privileges
he
had
the
whole
party
will
be
glad
when
he
is
safely
landed
in
kentucky
i
am
sure
said
sherman
as
the
door
closed
after
them
i
never
consent
to
take
another
dog
on
such
a
journey
after
all
the
trouble
and
expense
this
one
has
been
lloyd
is
so
devoted
to
him
that
she
is
heartbroken
if
he
has
to
be
tied
up
or
made
uncomfortable
in
any
way
she
probably
come
in
tears
because
he
wants
to
follow
her
and
must
be
kept
a
prisoner
while
they
waited
for
her
return
sherman
drew
eugenia
into
her
room
for
a
last
confidential
talk
and
betty
nestling
beside
cousin
carl
on
the
sofa
tried
to
thank
him
for
all
his
fatherly
kindness
to
her
on
their
long
pilgrimage
together
but
he
would
not
let
her
put
her
gratitude
in
words
his
answer
was
the
same
that
it
had
been
that
last
night
of
the
house
party
when
looking
down
the
locust
avenue
gleaming
with
its
myriad
of
lights
like
some
road
to
the
city
of
the
shining
ones
she
had
cried
out
oh
is
everybody
so
good
to
me
the
others
came
in
presently
and
the
evening
seemed
to
be
on
wings
it
flew
so
swiftly
as
they
planned
for
another
summer
to
be
spent
at
locust
when
eugenia
should
come
home
from
her
year
in
the
paris
school
and
never
it
seemed
were
good
nights
followed
so
quickly
by
good
mornings
or
good
mornings
by
almost
before
they
realised
that
the
parting
time
had
actually
come
the
little
colonel
and
betty
were
leaning
over
the
railing
of
the
great
steamer
waving
their
handkerchiefs
to
eugenia
and
her
father
on
the
dock
smaller
and
smaller
grew
the
familiar
outlines
wider
and
wider
the
distance
between
the
ship
and
the
shore
until
at
last
even
eugenia
red
jacket
faded
into
a
mere
speck
and
it
was
no
longer
of
any
use
to
wave
chapter
xi
homeward
bound
on
that
long
homeward
journey
it
was
well
for
hero
that
he
wore
the
red
cross
on
his
collar
the
little
symbol
was
the
open
sesame
to
many
a
privilege
that
ordinary
dogs
are
not
allowed
on
shipboard
instead
of
being
confined
to
the
hold
he
was
given
the
liberty
of
the
ship
and
when
his
story
was
known
he
received
as
much
flattering
attention
as
if
he
had
been
some
titled
nobleman
the
captain
shook
the
big
white
paw
gravely
put
into
his
hand
at
the
little
colonel
bidding
and
then
stooped
to
stroke
the
dog
head
as
he
looked
into
the
wistful
intelligent
eyes
his
own
grew
tender
i
have
a
son
in
the
service
he
said
sent
back
from
south
africa
covered
with
scars
i
know
what
that
red
cross
meant
to
him
for
a
good
many
long
weeks
go
where
you
like
old
fellow
the
ship
is
yours
so
long
as
you
make
no
trouble
oh
thank
you
cried
the
little
colonel
looking
up
at
the
big
british
captain
with
a
beaming
face
i
rathah
be
tied
up
myself
than
to
have
hero
kept
down
there
in
the
hold
i
suah
he
not
bothah
anybody
nor
did
he
no
one
from
stoker
to
deck
steward
could
make
the
slightest
complaint
against
him
so
dignified
and
well
behaved
was
he
lloyd
was
proud
of
him
and
his
devotion
wherever
she
went
he
followed
her
lying
at
her
feet
when
she
sat
in
her
walking
close
beside
her
when
she
and
betty
promenaded
the
deck
everybody
stopped
to
speak
to
him
and
to
question
lloyd
and
betty
about
him
so
that
it
was
not
many
days
before
the
little
girls
and
the
great
bernard
had
made
friends
of
all
the
passengers
who
were
able
to
be
on
deck
the
hours
are
long
at
sea
and
people
gladly
welcome
anything
that
provides
entertainment
so
lloyd
and
betty
were
often
called
aside
as
they
walked
and
invited
to
join
some
group
and
tell
to
a
knot
of
interested
listeners
all
they
knew
of
hero
and
the
major
and
the
training
of
the
french
ambulance
dogs
in
return
lloyd
stories
nearly
always
called
forth
some
anecdote
from
her
listeners
about
the
red
cross
work
in
america
and
to
her
great
surprise
she
found
five
persons
among
them
who
had
met
clara
barton
in
some
great
national
calamity
of
fire
flood
or
pestilence
one
was
a
portly
man
with
a
gruff
voice
who
had
passed
through
the
experiences
of
the
forest
fires
that
swept
through
michigan
over
twenty
years
ago
as
he
told
his
story
he
made
the
scenes
so
real
that
the
children
forgot
where
they
were
they
could
almost
smell
the
thick
stifling
smoke
of
the
burning
forest
hear
the
terrible
crackling
of
the
flames
feel
the
scorching
heat
in
their
faces
and
see
the
frightened
cattle
driven
into
the
lakes
and
streams
by
the
pursuing
fire
they
listened
with
startled
eyes
as
he
described
the
wall
of
flame
hemming
in
the
peaceful
home
where
his
little
son
played
around
the
they
held
their
breath
while
he
told
of
their
mad
flight
from
it
when
lashing
his
horses
into
a
gallop
he
looked
back
to
see
it
licking
up
everything
in
the
world
he
held
dear
except
the
frightened
little
family
huddled
at
his
feet
he
had
worked
hard
to
build
the
cottage
it
was
furnished
with
family
heirlooms
brought
west
with
them
from
the
old
homestead
in
vermont
it
was
hard
to
see
those
great
red
tongues
devouring
it
in
a
mouthful
in
the
morning
although
they
had
reached
a
place
of
safety
they
were
out
in
a
charred
blackened
wilderness
without
a
roof
to
shelter
them
a
chair
to
sit
on
or
a
crust
to
eat
the
hardest
thing
to
bear
he
said
was
to
hear
my
little
bertie
begging
for
his
breakfast
and
to
know
that
there
was
nothing
within
miles
of
us
to
satisfy
his
hunger
and
that
the
next
day
it
would
be
the
same
and
the
next
and
the
next
we
were
powerless
to
help
ourselves
but
while
we
sat
there
in
utter
despair
a
neighbour
rode
by
and
hailed
us
he
told
us
that
red
cross
committees
had
started
out
from
milwaukee
and
chicago
at
first
tidings
of
the
fire
with
of
supplies
and
that
if
we
could
go
to
the
place
where
they
were
distributing
we
could
get
whatever
we
needed
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
what
they
were
handing
out
when
we
got
there
tools
and
lumber
to
put
up
cabins
food
and
beds
and
clothes
and
they
thought
of
everything
and
provided
everything
and
they
went
about
the
distributing
in
a
systematic
businesslike
way
that
somehow
put
heart
and
cheer
into
us
all
they
did
make
us
feel
as
if
they
were
handing
out
alms
to
paupers
but
as
if
they
were
helping
some
of
their
own
family
on
to
their
feet
again
and
putting
them
in
shape
to
help
themselves
even
my
little
bertie
felt
it
young
as
he
was
he
never
forgot
that
awful
night
when
we
fled
from
the
fire
nor
the
hungry
day
that
followed
nor
the
fact
that
the
arm
that
carried
him
food
when
he
got
it
at
last
wore
a
brassard
marked
like
that
he
touched
the
red
cross
on
hero
collar
and
when
the
chance
came
to
show
the
same
brotherly
spirit
to
some
one
else
in
trouble
and
pass
the
help
along
he
was
as
ready
as
the
rest
of
us
to
do
his
share
three
years
afterward
i
read
in
the
papers
of
the
floods
that
had
swept
through
the
ohio
and
mississippi
valleys
and
of
the
thousands
that
were
homeless
bertie
he
was
six
then
he
listened
to
the
account
of
the
children
walking
the
streets
crying
because
they
had
a
roof
over
them
or
anything
to
eat
he
did
say
a
word
but
he
climbed
up
to
the
mantel
and
took
down
his
little
red
we
were
pretty
near
on
our
feet
again
by
that
time
although
we
were
still
living
in
a
cabin
the
crops
had
been
good
and
we
had
been
able
to
save
a
little
he
poured
out
all
the
pennies
and
nickels
in
his
bank
cents
they
came
to
and
then
he
got
his
only
store
toy
a
box
of
tin
soldiers
that
had
been
sent
to
him
christmas
and
put
that
on
the
table
beside
the
money
we
did
appear
to
notice
what
he
was
doing
presently
he
brought
the
mittens
his
grandmother
up
in
vermont
had
knit
for
him
then
he
waited
a
bit
and
seemed
to
be
weighing
something
in
his
mind
by
and
by
he
slipped
away
to
the
chest
where
his
sunday
clothes
were
kept
and
took
them
out
new
suit
shoes
cap
and
all
and
laid
them
on
the
table
with
the
money
and
the
tin
soldiers
daddy
he
said
the
red
cross
people
to
send
them
to
some
little
boy
like
me
that
been
washed
out
of
his
home
and
has
anything
of
toys
left
or
his
clothes
i
tell
you
it
made
a
lump
come
up
in
my
throat
to
see
that
the
little
fellow
had
taken
his
very
best
to
pay
his
debt
of
gratitude
nothing
was
too
great
for
him
to
sacrifice
even
his
tin
soldiers
went
when
he
remembered
what
the
red
cross
had
done
for
him
my
experience
with
the
red
cross
was
in
the
mississippi
floods
of
said
a
gentleman
who
had
joined
the
party
one
winter
day
we
were
attracted
by
screams
out
in
the
river
and
found
that
they
came
from
some
people
who
were
floating
down
on
a
house
that
had
been
washed
away
there
they
were
that
freezing
weather
out
in
the
middle
of
the
river
their
clothes
frozen
on
them
ill
from
fright
and
exposure
i
went
out
in
one
of
the
boats
that
was
sent
to
their
rescue
and
helped
bring
them
to
shore
i
was
so
impressed
by
the
tales
of
suffering
they
told
that
i
went
up
the
river
to
investigate
at
every
town
and
nearly
every
steamboat
landing
i
found
men
from
the
relief
committees
already
at
work
distributing
supplies
they
did
stop
when
they
had
provided
food
and
clothing
they
furnished
seed
by
the
to
the
farmers
just
as
in
the
galveston
disaster
a
few
years
ago
they
furnished
thousands
of
strawberry
plants
to
the
people
who
were
wholly
dependent
on
their
crops
for
their
next
year
food
where
did
they
get
all
those
stores
asked
lloyd
and
the
seeds
and
the
strawberry
plants
most
of
it
was
donated
answered
the
gentleman
many
contributions
come
pouring
in
after
such
a
disaster
just
as
little
bertie
did
but
the
society
is
busy
all
the
time
collecting
and
storing
away
the
things
that
may
be
needed
at
a
moment
notice
people
would
contribute
of
course
even
if
there
were
no
society
to
take
charge
of
their
donations
but
without
its
wise
hands
to
distribute
much
would
be
lost
a
number
of
years
ago
a
physician
in
bedford
indiana
gave
a
tract
of
land
to
the
american
national
red
cross
more
than
a
square
mile
i
believe
a
beautiful
farm
with
buildings
and
a
place
where
material
can
be
accumulated
and
stored
by
the
terms
of
the
treaty
of
geneva
forty
nations
are
pledged
to
hold
it
sacred
for
ever
against
all
invading
armies
to
the
use
of
the
red
cross
it
is
the
only
spot
on
earth
pledged
to
perpetual
peace
it
was
from
a
lady
in
black
who
had
had
two
sons
drowned
in
the
johnstown
flood
that
lloyd
and
betty
heard
the
description
of
clara
barton
five
months
labour
there
a
doctor
wife
who
had
been
in
the
mt
vernon
cyclone
and
a
newspaper
man
who
had
visited
the
south
carolina
islands
after
the
tidal
wave
and
charleston
after
the
earthquake
piled
up
their
accounts
of
those
scenes
of
suffering
some
of
them
even
greater
than
the
horrors
of
war
so
that
lloyd
could
not
sleep
that
night
for
thinking
of
them
betty
she
whispered
across
the
stateroom
turning
over
in
her
berth
betty
are
you
awake
yes
do
you
want
anything
i
ca
sleep
that
all
every
time
i
shut
my
eyes
i
see
all
those
awful
things
they
told
about
cities
in
ruins
and
dead
people
lying
around
in
piles
and
the
yellow
fevah
camps
and
floods
and
fiah
it
is
a
dreadful
world
betty
no
one
knows
what
awful
thing
is
goin
to
happen
next
do
think
about
the
dreadful
part
urged
betty
think
of
the
funny
things
brown
told
of
the
time
the
levee
broke
at
shawneetown
the
table
all
set
for
supper
and
the
water
pouring
in
until
the
table
floated
up
to
the
ceiling
and
went
bobbing
around
like
a
fish
that
does
help
any
said
lloyd
after
a
moment
i
see
the
watah
crawlin
highah
and
highah
up
the
walls
above
the
piano
and
pictuahs
till
i
feel
as
if
it
is
crawlin
aftah
me
and
will
be
all
ovah
the
bed
in
a
minute
did
you
evah
think
how
solemn
it
is
betty
lewis
to
be
away
out
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
with
nothing
but
a
few
planks
between
us
and
drownin
seems
to
me
the
ship
pitches
around
moah
than
usual
and
the
engine
makes
a
mighty
strange
creakin
noise
do
you
remember
the
night
i
put
you
to
sleep
at
the
cuckoo
nest
asked
betty
the
night
after
you
fell
down
the
barn
stairs
playing
shut
your
eyes
and
let
me
try
it
again
it
was
no
nursery
legend
or
border
ballad
that
betty
crooned
this
time
but
some
peaceful
lines
of
the
old
quaker
poet
and
the
quiet
comfort
of
them
stole
into
lloyd
throbbing
brain
and
soothed
her
excited
fancy
long
after
betty
was
asleep
she
went
on
repeating
to
herself
the
last
lines
i
know
not
where
his
islands
lift
their
fronded
palms
in
air
i
only
know
i
can
not
drift
beyond
his
love
and
care
she
did
dream
of
fires
and
floods
that
night
but
the
horror
of
the
scenes
was
less
because
a
baby
voice
called
cheerfully
through
them
here
daddy
give
these
to
the
poor
little
boys
that
are
cold
and
homesick
and
a
great
bernard
with
a
red
cross
on
his
back
ran
around
distributing
mittens
and
tin
soldiers
now
that
we
are
across
the
ocean
said
sherman
next
morning
i
may
give
you
allison
walton
letter
she
enclosed
it
in
one
her
mother
wrote
and
asked
me
not
to
give
it
to
you
until
we
were
in
i
suppose
her
experience
in
coming
over
from
manila
taught
her
that
letters
are
more
appreciated
then
than
at
the
beginning
of
the
voyage
the
little
colonel
unfolded
it
exclaiming
in
surprise
it
is
dated
i
thought
that
they
were
in
lloydsboro
valley
all
summah
in
the
cottage
next
to
the
churchyard
that
one
you
used
to
like
she
added
turning
to
betty
the
one
with
the
high
green
roof
and
deah
little
so
they
are
in
the
valley
answered
her
mother
but
their
new
house
is
finished
now
and
they
have
moved
into
that
as
they
have
left
all
the
beautiful
beech
grove
standing
around
it
they
have
decided
to
call
the
place
the
beeches
as
ours
is
called
locust
on
account
of
the
trees
in
front
of
it
beckoning
to
betty
to
come
and
listen
lloyd
sat
down
to
read
the
letter
and
sherman
turned
to
an
acquaintance
next
her
it
is
general
walton
family
of
whom
we
were
speaking
she
explained
since
his
death
in
manila
they
have
been
living
in
louisville
until
recently
we
are
so
delighted
to
think
that
they
have
now
come
to
the
valley
to
live
it
was
walton
home
in
her
girlhood
and
her
mother
place
edgewood
is
just
across
the
avenue
from
the
beeches
lloyd
and
the
little
girls
are
the
best
of
friends
and
we
are
all
interested
in
ranald
the
only
son
he
was
the
youngest
captain
in
the
army
you
know
he
received
his
appointment
and
was
under
fire
before
he
was
twelve
years
old
oh
mothah
spoke
up
lloyd
so
eagerly
that
she
did
not
notice
that
she
had
interrupted
the
conversation
listen
to
this
please
you
know
i
wrote
to
allison
about
hero
and
this
lettah
is
neahly
all
about
him
she
said
her
fathah
knew
clara
barton
and
that
in
cuba
and
manila
the
games
and
books
that
the
red
cross
sent
to
the
hospitals
were
appreciated
by
the
soldiahs
almost
as
much
as
the
delicacies
and
she
says
her
mothah
thinks
it
would
be
fine
for
us
all
to
start
a
fund
for
the
red
cross
they
wanted
to
get
up
a
play
because
they
always
havin
tableaux
and
such
things
they
been
readin
women
again
and
jo
christmas
play
made
them
want
to
do
something
like
that
they
can
have
all
the
shields
and
knights
costumes
that
the
macintyre
boys
had
when
they
gave
benefit
they
were
going
to
have
an
entahtainment
last
week
but
agree
allison
wanted
to
play
because
there
are
such
pretty
costumes
in
that
but
kitty
wanted
to
make
up
one
all
about
witches
and
spooks
and
and
call
it
ghost
of
cocklin
tower
she
wanted
to
be
the
ghost
they
decided
to
wait
till
we
get
home
befo
they
do
anything
there
your
opportunity
betty
said
sherman
turning
to
her
goddaughter
with
a
smile
why
ca
you
distinguish
yourself
by
writing
a
play
that
will
make
us
all
proud
of
you
and
at
the
same
time
swell
the
funds
of
the
red
cross
oh
do
you
really
think
i
could
godmother
are
you
in
earnest
cried
betty
her
face
shining
with
pleasure
entirely
so
answered
sherman
running
her
hand
caressingly
over
betty
brown
hair
this
little
curly
head
is
full
of
all
sorts
of
tales
of
goblins
and
ogres
and
witches
and
fairy
folk
string
them
together
dear
in
some
sort
of
shape
and
i
help
with
the
costumes
the
suggestion
was
made
playfully
but
betty
looked
dreamily
out
to
sea
her
face
radiant
the
longing
to
do
something
to
please
her
godmother
and
make
her
proud
of
her
was
the
first
impulse
that
thrilled
her
but
as
she
began
to
search
her
brain
for
a
plot
the
joy
of
the
work
itself
made
her
forget
everything
else
even
the
passing
of
time
she
was
amazed
when
lloyd
called
to
her
that
they
were
going
down
to
lunch
she
had
sat
the
entire
morning
wrapped
in
her
looking
out
across
the
water
with
eyes
as
the
blue
waves
rose
and
fell
her
thoughts
had
risen
and
swayed
to
their
rhythmic
motion
and
begun
to
shape
themselves
into
rhyme
line
after
line
was
taking
form
and
she
wished
impatiently
that
lloyd
had
not
called
her
how
could
one
be
hungry
when
some
inward
power
past
understanding
was
making
music
in
one
soul
she
followed
lloyd
down
to
the
table
like
one
in
a
trance
but
the
spell
was
broken
for
awhile
by
lloyd
persistent
chatter
you
know
there
all
sort
of
things
you
could
have
she
suggested
if
you
wanted
to
use
them
in
the
piece
tarbaby
and
the
filipino
pony
and
we
could
even
borrow
the
beah
from
fairchance
if
you
wanted
anything
like
beauty
and
the
beast
we
had
that
once
though
at
jonesy
benefit
so
maybe
you
would
want
to
use
it
again
there
to
be
a
knight
in
it
answered
betty
and
he
be
mounted
in
one
scene
so
we
may
need
one
of
the
ponies
then
she
turned
to
her
godmother
do
you
suppose
there
is
a
anywhere
in
the
neighbourhood
that
we
could
borrow
yes
i
have
one
of
my
stored
away
in
the
you
may
have
that
the
little
colonel
shrugged
her
shoulders
impatiently
oh
i
ca
wait
to
know
what
you
goin
to
do
with
a
in
the
play
tell
me
now
betty
but
the
little
playwright
only
shook
her
head
i
not
sure
myself
yet
but
i
keep
thinking
of
the
humming
of
the
wheel
and
a
sort
of
keeps
running
through
my
head
i
thought
too
it
would
help
to
make
a
pretty
scene
you
goin
to
put
hero
in
it
are
you
was
the
little
question
oh
lloyd
i
ca
cried
betty
in
dismay
a
dog
could
have
a
part
with
princes
and
witches
and
fairies
i
do
see
why
not
persisted
lloyd
i
take
half
the
interest
if
he
is
in
it
i
think
you
might
put
him
in
betty
she
urged
do
as
much
for
you
if
it
was
something
you
had
set
your
heart
on
betty
she
begged
but
he
wo
fit
anywhere
said
betty
in
a
distressed
tone
i
put
him
in
gladly
if
he
only
go
but
do
you
see
lloyd
he
appropriate
it
would
spoil
the
whole
thing
to
drag
him
in
i
do
see
why
said
lloyd
a
trifle
sharply
is
it
going
to
be
a
red
cross
entahtainment
and
is
hero
a
red
cross
dog
i
think
appropriate
for
him
to
have
a
part
even
one
of
the
principal
ones
i
ca
think
of
a
single
thing
for
him
to
do
began
betty
you
can
if
you
try
hard
enough
insisted
lloyd
betty
sighed
hopelessly
and
turned
to
her
lunch
in
silence
she
wanted
to
please
the
little
colonel
but
it
seemed
impossible
to
her
to
give
hero
a
part
without
spoiling
the
entertainment
maybe
some
of
the
books
in
the
ship
library
might
help
you
said
sherman
who
had
been
an
amused
listener
i
look
over
some
of
them
for
you
later
in
the
day
he
came
up
to
betty
where
she
stood
leaning
against
the
deck
railing
he
laid
a
book
upon
it
open
at
a
picture
of
seven
white
swans
do
you
remember
this
he
asked
the
seven
brothers
who
were
changed
to
swans
and
the
good
sister
who
wove
a
coat
for
each
one
out
of
flax
she
spun
from
the
churchyard
nettles
the
magic
coats
gave
them
back
their
human
forms
maybe
you
can
use
the
same
idea
and
have
your
prince
changed
into
a
dog
for
awhile
oh
thank
you
she
cried
i
forgotten
that
story
i
am
sure
it
will
help
he
walked
away
leaving
her
poring
over
the
picture
but
presently
as
he
paced
the
deck
he
felt
her
light
touch
on
his
arm
and
turned
to
see
her
glowing
little
face
looking
up
into
his
i
got
it
she
cried
the
picture
made
me
think
of
the
very
thing
i
had
been
fumbling
with
a
tangled
skein
trying
to
find
a
place
to
begin
unwinding
now
you
have
given
me
the
starting
thread
and
it
all
begins
to
smooth
out
beautifully
i
going
for
pencil
and
paper
now
to
write
it
all
down
before
i
forget
that
pencil
and
were
her
constant
companions
the
rest
of
the
voyage
sometimes
lloyd
coming
upon
her
suddenly
would
hear
her
whispering
a
list
of
rhymes
such
as
more
core
pour
store
shore
before
or
creature
teacher
feature
at
which
they
would
both
laugh
and
betty
exclaim
hopelessly
i
ca
find
a
word
to
fit
that
place
at
other
times
lloyd
passed
her
in
respectful
silence
for
she
knew
by
the
rapt
look
on
betty
face
that
the
mysterious
business
of
was
proceeding
satisfactorily
and
she
dared
not
interrupt
the
day
they
sighted
land
lloyd
exclaimed
oh
i
can
hardly
wait
to
get
home
i
had
a
perfectly
lovely
summah
and
i
enjoyed
every
mile
of
the
journey
but
the
closah
i
get
to
locust
the
moah
it
seems
to
me
that
the
very
nicest
thing
my
can
unroll
except
givin
me
hero
of
is
the
goin
back
home
your
repeated
betty
who
knew
the
birthday
story
that
gives
me
an
idea
the
princess
shall
have
a
in
the
play
lloyd
laughed
i
believe
that
all
you
think
about
nowadays
betty
put
up
yoah
scribblin
for
awhile
and
come
and
watch
them
swing
the
trunks
up
out
of
the
hold

almost

chapter
xii
home
again
meanwhile
in
lloydsboro
valley
the
summer
had
slipped
slowly
by
locust
seemed
strangely
quiet
with
the
great
front
gates
locked
and
never
any
sound
of
wheels
or
voices
coming
down
the
avenue
judge
moore
place
was
closed
also
and
tanglewood
just
across
the
way
had
been
opened
only
a
few
weeks
in
the
spring
so
birds
and
squirrels
held
undisputed
possession
of
that
part
of
the
valley
and
the
grass
grew
long
and
the
vines
climbed
high
and
often
the
soft
whisper
of
the
leaves
was
the
only
sound
to
be
heard
but
in
the
shady
beech
grove
next
the
churchyard
and
across
the
avenue
from
macintyre
the
noise
of
hammer
and
saw
and
trowel
had
gone
on
unceasingly
until
at
last
the
new
home
was
ready
for
its
occupants
the
family
did
not
have
far
to
move
to
the
beeches
only
over
the
stile
from
the
quaint
cottage
next
door
where
they
had
spent
the
summer
allison
kitty
and
elise
climbed
back
and
forth
over
the
stile
their
arms
full
of
their
particular
treasures
which
they
could
not
trust
to
the
all
the
week
that
betty
and
lloyd
were
tossing
out
on
the
ocean
they
were
flitting
about
the
new
house
growing
accustomed
to
its
unfamiliar
corners
by
the
time
the
steamed
into
the
new
york
harbour
they
were
as
much
at
home
in
their
new
surroundings
as
if
they
had
always
lived
there
the
tent
was
pitched
on
the
lawn
the
large
family
of
dolls
was
brought
out
under
the
trees
and
the
games
good
times
and
cooking
went
on
as
if
they
had
never
been
interrupted
for
an
instant
by
the
work
of
moving
whose
day
is
it
for
the
asked
walton
coming
out
on
the
steps
one
morning
it
was
mine
answered
kitty
speaking
up
from
the
hammock
where
she
swung
half
in
half
out
watching
a
colony
of
ants
crawling
along
the
ground
underneath
but
i
traded
my
turn
to
elise
for
her
biggest
paper
boy
doll
and
i
traded
my
turn
to
allison
if
she
would
let
me
use
all
the
purple
and
yellow
paint
i
want
in
her
while
i
am
making
my
princess
pansy
ball
dress
said
elise
walton
smiled
at
the
transfer
of
rights
the
little
girls
had
an
arrangement
by
which
they
took
turns
in
using
the
cart
certain
days
in
the
week
when
ranald
did
not
want
to
ride
his
filipino
pony
whoever
has
it
may
do
an
errand
for
me
walton
said
adding
as
she
turned
toward
the
house
do
you
know
that
lloyd
and
betty
are
coming
on
the
three
train
this
afternoon
then
i
do
want
the
exclaimed
allison
quickly
i
going
down
to
the
depot
to
meet
them
the
depot
was
in
sight
of
the
beeches
not
more
than
three
minutes
walk
distant
ca
go
back
on
your
trade
sang
out
elise
ca
go
back
on
your
trade
oh
you
take
it
elise
coaxed
allison
it
my
regular
turn
i
make
some
fudge
in
the
morning
if
you
will
elise
considered
a
moment
well
she
said
finally
i
let
you
off
from
your
trade
if
kitty
will
let
me
off
from
mine
no
answered
kitty
a
trade
a
trade
i
want
that
paper
boy
doll
but
it
your
regular
turn
coaxed
elise
and
i
much
rather
go
down
to
the
depot
to
meet
the
girls
than
go
riding
so
would
i
said
kitty
spurring
the
procession
of
ants
to
faster
speed
with
her
slipper
toe
then
she
sat
up
and
considered
the
matter
a
moment
oh
well
she
said
presently
i
do
care
after
all
if
it
will
oblige
you
any
i
let
you
off
and
take
the
pony
myself
oh
thank
you
sister
cried
elise
they
only
be
at
the
depot
a
few
minutes
continued
the
wily
kitty
so
i
drive
down
to
meet
them
in
style
in
the
cart
and
then
i
go
up
to
locust
with
them
beside
the
carriage
and
hear
all
about
the
trip
first
of
anybody
i
wish
i
thought
of
that
said
elise
a
shade
of
disappointment
in
her
big
dark
eyes
i
tell
you
proposed
allison
enthusiastically
we
go
down
in
the
to
meet
them
together
that
would
be
the
nicest
way
to
do
oh
was
kitty
cool
reply
i
had
thought
of
going
by
for
katy
or
corinne
then
seeing
the
disappointment
in
the
faces
opposite
she
added
but
maybe
i
might
change
my
mind
have
you
got
anything
to
trade
for
a
chance
to
go
this
transfer
of
possessions
which
they
carried
on
was
like
a
continuous
game
of
which
they
never
tired
because
of
its
endless
variety
it
was
a
source
of
great
amusement
to
the
older
members
of
the
family
it
is
a
mystery
to
me
said
miss
allison
how
they
manage
to
keep
track
of
their
property
and
remember
who
is
the
owner
i
have
known
a
doll
or
a
dish
to
change
hands
half
a
dozen
times
in
the
course
of
a
forenoon
elise
promptly
offered
the
paper
boy
doll
again
which
was
promptly
accepted
allison
had
nothing
to
offer
which
kitty
considered
equivalent
to
a
seat
in
the
cart
but
by
a
roundabout
transfer
the
trade
was
finally
made
allison
gave
elise
the
amount
of
purple
and
yellow
paint
she
needed
for
the
princess
pansy
ball
gown
in
return
for
which
elise
gave
her
a
piece
of
spangled
gauze
which
kitty
had
long
had
an
eye
upon
allison
in
turn
handed
the
gauze
to
kitty
for
her
right
to
a
seat
in
the
and
the
affair
was
thus
happily
settled
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
parties
it
that
we
are
selfish
with
each
other
allison
had
retorted
indignantly
one
day
when
corinne
remarked
that
she
did
see
how
sisters
who
loved
each
other
could
be
so
particular
about
everything
it
only
with
our
toys
and
the
cart
that
we
do
that
way
it
a
kind
of
game
that
we
played
always
and
think
it
lots
of
fun
so
it
happened
that
that
afternoon
when
the
train
stopped
at
lloydsboro
valley
the
first
thing
the
little
colonel
saw
was
the
drawn
close
to
the
platform
then
three
little
girls
in
white
dresses
and
fresh
ribbons
smiling
broadly
under
their
big
hats
sprang
out
to
give
them
a
warm
welcome
home
with
enthusiastic
hugs
and
kisses
hero
turn
came
next
released
from
his
long
tiresome
confinement
in
the
he
came
bounding
into
their
midst
almost
upsetting
the
little
colonel
in
his
joy
at
having
his
freedom
again
he
put
out
his
great
paw
to
each
of
the
little
girls
in
turn
as
lloyd
bade
him
shake
hands
with
his
new
neighbours
but
he
growled
suspiciously
when
walker
came
up
and
laid
black
fingers
upon
him
he
had
never
seen
a
coloured
man
before
it
was
betty
first
meeting
with
the
walton
girls
she
had
looked
forward
to
it
eagerly
first
because
they
were
the
daughters
of
a
man
whom
her
little
heart
honoured
as
one
of
the
greatest
generals
of
the
army
who
had
given
his
life
to
his
country
and
died
bravely
in
its
service
and
secondly
because
lloyd
letters
the
winter
before
had
been
full
of
their
sayings
and
doings
sherman
too
had
told
her
many
things
of
their
life
in
manila
and
she
felt
that
children
who
had
such
unusual
experiences
could
not
fail
to
be
interesting
there
was
a
third
reason
however
that
she
scanned
each
face
so
closely
she
had
given
them
parts
in
the
new
play
and
she
was
wondering
how
well
they
would
fit
those
parts
they
in
turn
cast
many
inquiring
glances
at
betty
for
they
had
heard
all
about
this
little
that
had
been
taken
away
from
the
nest
they
had
read
her
poem
on
night
which
was
published
in
a
real
paper
and
they
could
not
help
looking
upon
her
with
a
deep
feeling
of
respect
tinged
a
little
with
awe
that
a
girl
could
write
verses
good
enough
to
be
published
they
had
heard
keith
enthusiastic
praises
of
her
betty
a
brick
he
had
said
telling
of
several
incidents
of
the
house
party
especially
the
picnic
at
the
old
mill
when
she
had
gone
so
far
to
keep
her
sacred
promise
she
the
very
nicest
girl
i
know
he
had
added
emphatically
and
that
was
high
praise
coming
from
the
particular
keith
who
judged
all
girls
by
the
standard
of
his
mother
as
soon
as
the
trunks
were
attended
to
sherman
led
the
way
to
the
carriage
waiting
on
the
other
side
of
the
platform
hero
was
given
a
place
beside
walker
and
although
he
sprang
up
obediently
when
he
was
bidden
he
eyed
his
companion
suspiciously
all
the
way
the
trundled
along
beside
the
carriage
the
girls
calling
back
and
forth
to
each
other
above
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
oh
is
hero
the
loveliest
dog
that
ever
was
but
you
ought
to
see

this
from
the
carriage
the
great
entrance

were
unlocked
now
the
lawn
smoothly
cut
the
green
of
vines
trimly
trained
around
the
high
white
pillars
of
the
porches
the
turned
back
at
the
gate
and
the
carriage
drove
slowly
up
the
avenue
alone
the
mellow
sunlight
of
the
warm
september
afternoon
filtered
down
like
gold
through
the
trees
arching
overhead
the
sun
shines
bright
on
my
old
kentucky
home
sang
lloyd
softly
leaning
out
of
the
carriage
to
wave
her
hand
to
mom
beck
who
in
whitest
of
aprons
and
gayest
of
head
bandanas
stood
smiling
and
curtseying
on
the
steps
the
good
old
black
face
beamed
with
happiness
as
she
cried
heah
comes
my
baby
an
miss
betty
too
bless
her
soul
an
body
around
the
house
came
may
lily
and
a
tribe
of
little
pickaninnies
who
fell
back
at
sight
of
hero
leaping
out
of
the
carriage
he
was
the
largest
dog
they
had
ever
seen
lloyd
called
them
all
around
her
and
made
them
each
shake
hands
with
the
astonished
bernard
who
did
not
seem
to
relish
this
part
of
his
introduction
to
kentucky

used

to

her
godmother
up
the
wide
stairs
you
to
have
the
same
white
and
gold
room
again
dear
said
sherman
peeping
in
as
she
passed
the
door
i
see
that
it
is
all
in
readiness
so
walk
in
and
take
possession
betty
was
glad
that
she
was
alone
those
first
few
minutes
the
joy
of
the
was
so
keen
going
in
she
shut
the
door
and
gave
a
swift
glance
all
around
from
the
dark
polished
floor
with
its
white
angora
rugs
to
the
filmy
white
curtains
at
the
open
casement
windows
everything
was
just
as
she
had
seen
it
last
the
dear
little
white
with
its
crystal
candlesticks
that
always
made
her
think
of
twisted
icicles
the
little
pincushion
and
all
the
dainty
toilet
articles
of
ivory
and
gold
the
pictures
on
the
wall
the
freshly
gathered
plumes
of
goldenrod
in
the
crystal
bowl
on
the
mantel
she
stood
a
moment
looking
out
of
the
open
window
and
thinking
of
the
year
that
had
gone
by
since
she
last
stood
in
that
room
many
a
long
and
perilous
mile
she
had
travelled
but
here
she
was
back
in
safety
and
instead
of
bandaged
eyes
and
the
horror
of
blindness
hovering
over
her
she
was
able
to
look
out
on
the
beautiful
world
with
strong
sight
the
drudgery
of
the
cuckoo
nest
was
far
behind
her
now
and
the
bare
little
room
under
the
eaves
henceforth
this
was
to
be
her
home
she
remembered
the
day
in
the
church
when
her
godmother
invitation
to
the
house
party
reached
her
and
just
as
she
had
knelt
then
in
front
of
the
narrow
altar
she
knelt
now
beside
the
little
white
bed
now
as
then
the
late
afternoon
sun
streamed
across
her
brown
curls
and
shining
face
and
you
dear
came
in
the
same
grateful
whisper
from
the
depths
of
the
same
glad
little
heart
betty
betty
called
lloyd
under
her
window
come
and
take
a
run
over
the
place
i
want
to
show
hero
his
new
home
tired
of
sitting
still
so
long
on
the
cars
betty
was
glad
to
join
in
the
race
over
the
smooth
lawn
and
green
meadows
out
in
the
pasture
tarbaby
waited
by
the
bars
the
grapevine
swing
in
the
every
nook
and
corner
where
the
guests
of
the
house
party
had
romped
and
played
the
summer
before
seemed
to
hold
a
special
greeting
for
them
and
every
foot
of
ground
in
old
locust
seemed
dearer
for
their
long
absence
the
next
morning
when
tarbaby
was
led
around
for
lloyd
to
take
her
usual
ride
both
girls
gave
a
cry
of
delight
for
another
pony
followed
close
at
his
heels
it
was
the
one
that
had
been
kept
for
betty
use
during
the
house
party
it
is
lad
called
the
little
colonel
excitedly
oh
papa
jack
is
he
goin
to
stay
heah
all
the
time
yes
he
belongs
here
now
answered
sherman
i
want
both
my
little
girls
to
be
well
mounted
and
to
ride
every
day
he
motioned
to
a
card
hanging
from
lad
bridle
and
leaning
over
lloyd
read
aloud
for
betty
from
papa
jack
betty
could
hardly
realise
her
good
fortune
is
he
really
mine
she
insisted
the
same
as
tarbaby
is
lloyd
really
yours
and
just
the
same
answered
sherman
holding
out
his
hand
to
help
her
mount
she
tried
to
thank
him
tried
to
tell
him
how
happy
the
gift
had
made
her
but
words
could
not
measure
either
her
gratitude
or
her
pleasure
he
read
them
both
however
in
her
happy
face
as
he
swung
her
into
the
saddle
she
leaned
forward
saying
i
want
to
whisper
something
in
your
ear
mr
sherman
as
he
bent
his
head
she
whispered
thank
you
for
writing
papa
jack
on
the
card
that
made
me
happier
than
anything
else
that
is
what
i
want
you
to
call
me
always
now
my
little
daughter
he
answered
kissing
her
lightly
on
the
cheek
locust
is
your
home
now
and
you
belong
to
all
of
us
your
godmother
the
little
colonel
and
i
each
claim
a
share
what
makes
you
so
quiet
asked
lloyd
as
they
rode
on
down
the
avenue
i
was
thinking
of
the
way
joyce
fairy
tale
ended
said
betty
the
prince
came
into
his
kingdom
the
kingdom
of
loving
hearts
and
gentle
hands
only
this
time
it
the
princess
who
come
into
her
kingdom
what
do
you
mean
asked
lloyd
with
a
puzzled
look
oh
it
only
some
of
my
foolishness
said
betty
looking
back
over
her
shoulder
with
a
laugh
i
just
so
glad
that
i
alive
and
so
glad
that
i
am
me
and
so
happy
because
everybody
is
so
heavenly
kind
to
me
that
i
would
change
places
with
the
proudest
princess
that
ever
sat
on
a
throne
then
come
on
and
let
race
to
the
cried
lloyd
dashing
off
with
hero
bounding
along
beside
her
from
the
they
rode
to
the
beeches
where
allison
was
cooking
something
over
the
beside
the
tent
on
the
lawn
it
proved
to
be
candy
and
she
waved
a
sticky
spoon
in
welcome
walton
was
in
a
hammock
near
by
her
mending
basket
beside
her
and
kitty
and
elise
on
the
grass
at
her
feet
watching
the
molasses
bubble
up
in
the
kettle
betty
felt
a
little
shy
at
first
for
this
was
her
first
meeting
with
the
general
wife
and
she
wished
that
the
girls
would
not
insist
on
having
an
immediate
outline
of
the
play
it
had
seemed
very
fine
indeed
to
her
when
she
read
it
aloud
to
herself
or
repeated
it
to
lloyd
it
had
not
seemed
a
very
childish
thing
to
her
even
when
she
read
it
to
her
godmother
but
she
shrank
from
walton
criticism
it
was
with
many
blushes
that
she
began
afterward
she
wondered
why
she
should
have
been
timid
about
it
walton
applauded
it
so
heartily
and
entered
into
plans
for
making
the
entertainment
a
success
as
enthusiastically
as
any
of
the
girls
i
bid
to
be
witch
cried
kitty
when
betty
had
finished
i
like
to
be
the
queen
if
you
do
care
said
allison
for
i
am
the
largest
and
i
rather
act
with
rob
than
the
other
boys
but
it
make
any
difference
i
be
anything
you
want
me
to
that
the
way
betty
planned
it
said
lloyd
i
to
be
the
captive
princess
and
keith
will
be
my
brother
whom
the
witch
changes
into
a
dog
that
hero
of
malcolm
will
be
the
knight
who
rescues
me
rob
moore
will
be
king
and
elise
the
queen
of
the
fairies
and
ranald
the
ogah
ranald
said
last
night
that
he
would
be
in
the
play
if
he
had
to
learn
a
lot
of
foolishness
to
speak
or
if
he
could
be
disguised
so
that
nobody
would
know
him
said
kitty
he
help
any
other
way
fixing
the
stage
and
the
red
lights
and
all
that
but
the
captain
has
a
dread
of
making
himself
appear
ridiculous
now
do
i
rather
have
the
funny
parts
than
the
high
and
mighty
ones
he
might
be
suggested
betty
then
he
would
have
anything
to
do
but
drag
the
prince
and
princess
across
the
stage
to
the
ogre
tower
and
the
costume
could
be
so
hideous
that
no
one
could
tell
whether
a
human
or
a
hobgoblin
was
inside
of
it
who
buy
all
the
balloons
for
the
fairies
and
make
our
spangled
wings
asked
elise
oh
i
know
she
cried
instantly
answering
her
own
question
i
tell
aunt
elise
all
about
it
and
i
know
that
help
how
will
you
go
all
the
way
to
the
seashore
to
tell
her
asked
kitty
she
is
at
the
seashore
answered
elise
with
an
air
of
triumph
she
came
back
from
narragansett
pier
last
night
did
she
mamma
and
she
and
malcolm
and
keith
are
coming
out
to
grandmother
this
afternoon
as
straight
as
the
train
can
carry
them
you
might
know
they
always
do
first
thing
do
they
mamma
walton
nodded
yes
then
said
suppose
you
bring
the
play
down
this
afternoon
betty
ask
your
mother
to
come
too
lloyd
and
we
read
it
out
under
the
trees
now
are
all
the
characters
decided
upon
all
but
the
ogre
said
betty
joe
clark
is
the
very
one
for
that
exclaimed
lloyd
he
is
head
and
shouldahs
tallah
than
all
the
othah
boys
although
he
is
only
fifteen
and
his
voice
is
so
deep
and
gruff
it
sounds
as
if
it
came
out
of
the
cellah
we
can
stop
and
ask
him
if
he
take
the
part
invite
him
to
come
down
to
the
reading
of
the
play
too
said
walton
i
look
for
you
all
promptly
at
four
betty
almost
lost
her
courage
that
afternoon
when
she
saw
the
large
group
waiting
for
her
under
the
on
walton
lawn
macintyre
was
there
fresh
and
dainty
as
betty
always
remembered
her
with
the
sunshine
flickering
softly
through
the
leaves
on
her
beautiful
white
hair
miss
allison
who
in
the
children
opinion
knew
everything
sat
beside
her
and
worst
of
all
the
younger
macintyre
was
there
malcolm
and
keith
mother
whom
betty
had
never
seen
before
but
of
whom
she
had
heard
glowing
descriptions
from
her
admiring
sons
lloyd
pointed
her
out
to
betty
as
they
drove
in
at
the
gate
see
there
she
is
in
that
lovely
pink
organdy
would
you
love
to
look
like
her
i
would
she
like
a
queen
betty
sank
back
faint
with
embarrassment
oh
godmother
she
whispered
i
know
i
ca
read
it
before
all
those
people
it
will
choke
me
at
least
a
dozen
and
some
of
them
are
strangers
sherman
smiled
encouragingly
there
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
dear
your
play
is
beautiful
in
my
opinion
and
every
one
there
will
agree
with
me
when
they
all
heard
it
go
on
and
do
your
best
and
make
us
all
proud
of
you
there
was
no
time
to
hesitate
keith
was
already
swinging
on
the
carriage
steps
to
welcome
them
and
malcolm
and
ranald
were
bringing
out
more
chairs
to
make
places
for
them
with
the
group
under
the
beeches
nobody
mentioned
the
play
for
some
time
the
older
people
were
busy
questioning
sherman
about
her
summer
abroad
and
malcolm
and
keith
had
much
to
tell
the
others
of
their
vacation
at
the
seashore
of
polo
and
parties
and
and
several
pranks
that
sent
the
children
into
shrieks
of
laughter
in
the
midst
of
the
hum
of
conversation
betty
heart
almost
stood
still
walton
was
calling
the
company
to
order
coming
forward
she
led
betty
to
a
chair
in
the
centre
of
the
circle

asked
her
to

wrong
is
now
set

and
love
has
found
the
way
as
betty
finished
reading
there
was
a
babel
of
voices
and
a
clapping
of
hands
that
made
her
face
grow
redder
and
redder
they
were
all
trying
to
congratulate
her
at
once
and
she
was
so
confused
that
she
wished
she
could
run
away
and
hide
but
the
applause
was
very
sweet
to
shy
little
betty
she
felt
that
she
had
done
her
best
and
that
not
only
her
godmother
was
proud
of
her
but
keith
and
keith
beautiful
mother
who
bent
from
her
queenly
height
to
kiss
betty
flushed
cheek
and
whisper
a
word
of
praise
that
made
her
glow
for
weeks
afterward
whenever
she
thought
of
it
he
kissed
me
once
on
my
soft
pink
cheek
and
once
in
my
heart
of
gold
hummed
keith
say
betty
that
mighty
pretty
how
did
you
ever
think
of
it
before
she
could
answer
one
of
the
maids
came
out
with
a
tray
of
sherbet
and
cake
and
the
boys
sprang
up
to
help
serve
the
girls
i
know
some
of
my
part
already
said
kitty
stirring
her
sherbet
suggestively
and
repeating
in
a
sepulchral
tone
stir
this
hank
of
hair
this
patch
of
fur
this
feather
and
this
flapping
fin
this
claw
this
bone
this
dried
snake
skin
oh
kitty
for
mercy
sake
said
allison
you
make
my
blood
run
cold
but
i
must
if
we
only
a
week
to
get
ready
in
i
expect
to
say
it
day
and
night
it
better
to
do
that
than
to
take
more
than
a
week
and
give
up
the
camping
party
is
it
it
going
to
be
a
howling
success
prophesied
malcolm
when
mamma
and
auntie
and
aunt
mary
go
into
a
scheme
the
way
they
are
doing
now
costumes
and
drills
and
all
sorts
of
impossible
things
do
count
at
all
be
ready
in
plenty
of
time
especially
said
the
little
colonel
with
dignity
when
mothah
and
papa
jack
are
goin
to
do
so
much
my
is
longah
than
anybody
next
morning
at
the
depot
the
and
the
blacksmith
shop
a
sign
was
displayed
which
everybody
stopped
to
read
similar
announcements
nailed
on
various
trees
throughout
the
valley
caused
many
an
old
farmer
to
pull
up
his
team
and
adjust
his
spectacles
for
a
closer
view
of
this
novel
poster
they
were
all
miss
allison
work
each
one
bore
at
the
top
a
crayon
sketch
of
a
huge
bernard
with
a
red
cross
on
its
collar
and
underneath
was
a
notice
to
the
effect
that
an
entertainment
would
be
given
the
following
friday
night
in
the
college
hall
a
short
concert
followed
by
a
play
called
the
princess
winsome
rescue
in
which
the
red
cross
dog
recently
brought
from
switzerland
would
take
a
prominent
part
the
proceeds
were
to
be
given
to
the
cause
of
the
red
cross
that
announcement
alone
would
have
drawn
a
large
crowd
but
added
to
that
was
the
fact
that
twenty
families
in
the
valley
had
each
contributed
a
child
to
the
fairy
chorus
or
the
group
of
flower
messengers
and
were
thus
personally
interested
in
the
success
of
the
entertainment
there
was
scarcely
when
the
doors
were
opened
friday
evening
papa
jack
felt
well
repaid
for
his
part
in
the
hurried
preparations
when
after
the
musical
part
of
the
programme
he
heard
the
buzz
of
admiration
that
went
around
the
room
as
the
curtain
rose
on
the
first
scene
of
the
play
it
was
the
dimly
lighted
witch
orchard
across
the
stage
five
feet
back
from
the
footlights
ran
a
fence
with
posts
it
had
taken
him
all
morning
to
build
it
even
with
alec
and
walker
help
above
this
peered
a
thicket
of
small
trees
and
underbrush
bearing
a
marvellous
crop
of
gold
and
silver
apples
and
plums
real
gold
and
silver
fruit
it
looked
to
be
in
the
dim
light
and
not
the
discarded
ornaments
of
a
score
of
old
a
stuffed
owl
kept
guard
on
one
high
and
a
huge
black
velvet
cat
on
the
other
in
the
centre
of
the
stage
showing
plainly
through
the
open
double
gates
the
witch
caldron
hung
on
a
tripod
over
a
fire
of
fagots
here
kitty
dressed
like
an
old
hag
leaned
on
her
blackened
broomstick
stirring
the
brew
and
muttering
to
herself
at
one
side
of
the
stage
could
be
seen
the
door
leading
into
the
tower
and
above
it
a
tiny
casement
window
walton
gave
a
nod
of
satisfaction
over
her
work
when
the
ogre
came
roaring
in
his
costume
was
of
her
making
even
to
the
bludgeon
which
he
carried
nobody
could
guess
that
it
was
only
an
old
indian
club
painted
red
to
hide
the
lumps
of
i
had
to
stick
on
to
make
the
regulation
knots
she
whispered
to
keith
father
who
sat
next
her
and
no
one
would
ever
dream
that
the
ogre
is
joe
clark
i
had
hard
work
to
persuade
him
to
take
the
part
but
an
invitation
to
my
camping
party
next
week
proved
to
be
effective
bait
and
such
a
time
as
i
had
to
get
costume
i
was
about
to
ask
betty
to
change
his
name
when
elise
found
that
mardi
gras
frog
at
some
costumer
those
webbed
feet
and
hideous
eyes
are
enough
to
strike
terror
to
any
one
soul
it
was
a
play
in
which
every
one
was
pleased
with
the
part
given
him
allison
and
rob
swept
up
and
down
in
their
gilt
crowns
and
robes
of
royal
purple
feeling
that
as
king
and
queen
they
had
the
most
important
parts
of
all
keith
looked
every
inch
the
charming
prince
hero
he
personated
and
malcolm
made
such
a
dashing
knight
that
there
was
a
burst
of
applause
every
time
he
appeared
betty
made
a
dear
old
godmother
and
elise
with
crown
and
wand
filmy
spangled
wings
and
big
red
bubble
of
a
balloon
was
supremely
happy
as
queen
of
the
fairies
but
it
was
the
little
colonel
who
won
the
greatest
laurels
in
the
tower
room
making
the
prettiest
picture
of
all
as
she
bent
over
the
great
bernard
bewailing
their
fate
the
scenery
had
been
changed
with
little
delay
between
acts
three
tall
screens
hastily
unfolded
just
in
front
of
the
spiked
fence
hid
the
orchard
from
view
and
a
fourth
screen
served
the
double
purpose
of
forming
the
side
wall
of
the
room
and
hiding
the
ogre
tower
the
narrow
space
between
the
screens
and
the
footlights
was
ample
for
the
scene
that
took
place
there
and
the
arrangement
saved
much
trouble
for
in
the
last
act
the
screens
had
only
to
be
carried
away
to
leave
the
stage
with
its
original
setting
lloyd
never
looked
so
pretty
before
in
her
life
said
sherman
to
his
wife
as
they
watched
the
princess
winsome
tread
back
and
forth
beside
the
the
golden
cord
held
lightly
in
her
white
fingers
but
she
was
even
prettier
in
the
next
scene
when
with
the
dove
in
her
hands
she
stood
at
the
window
twining
the
slender
gold
chain
about
its
neck
and
singing
in
a
high
sweet
voice
clear
as
a
crystal
bell
flutter
and
fly
flutter
and
fly
bear
him
my
heart
of
gold
bid
him
be
brave
little
carrier
dove
bid
him
be
brave
and
bold
twice
many
hands
called
her
back
and
many
eyes
looked
admiringly
as
she
sang
the
song
again
holding
the
dove
to
her
breast
and
smoothing
its
white
feathers
as
she
repeated
the
words
tell
him
that
i
at
my
will
sing
while
it
turns
and
hums
and
think
all
day
of
his
love
so
leal
until
with
the
flute
he
comes
jack
said
some
one
in
a
low
tone
to
sherman
as
the
applause
died
away
for
the
third
time
jack
when
the
princess
winsome
is
a
little
older
you
be
wise
to
call
in
the
ogre
help
you
have
more
than
one
kentucky
knight
trying
to
carry
her
away
if
you
do
sherman
made
some
laughing
reply
but
turned
away
so
absorbed
by
a
thought
that
his
friend
words
had
suggested
that
he
lost
all
of
the
flower
messengers
speeches
that
some
knight
might
want
to
carry
off
his
little
princess
winsome
was
a
thought
that
had
never
occurred
to
him
except
as
some
remote
possibility
far
in
the
future
but
looking
at
her
as
she
stood
in
her
long
court
train
he
realised
that
in
a
few
more
months
she
would
be
in
her
teens
and
then
time
goes
so
fast
he
sighed
thinking
with
a
heavy
sinking
of
the
heart
that
it
might
be
only
a
few
years
until
she
would
be
counting
the
daisy
petals
in
earnest
the
curtain
hitched
just
at
the
last
so
that
it
would
not
go
down
so
with
their
rainbow
bubbles
bright
the
fairies
ran
off
the
stage
toward
various
points
in
the
audience
for
the
coveted
admiration
and
praise
which
they
knew
was
their
due
was
hero
fine
did
he
do
his
part
beautifully
cried
lloyd
as
her
father
with
one
long
step
raised
himself
up
to
a
place
beside
her
on
the
stage
where
the
children
were
holding
an
informal
reception
show
him
the
cried
keith
pressing
down
through
the
crowds
from
the
outer
door
whither
he
had
gone
after
the
entrance
receipts
just
look
old
fellow
there
dollars
and
dollars
in
there
see
what
you
done
for
the
red
cross
if
it
had
been
for
you
betty
never
would
have
written
the
play
and
if
it
had
been
for
betty
writing
the
play
you
never
would
have
sent
me
this
heart
of
gold
said
malcolm
in
an
aside
to
lloyd
as
he
unfastened
her
locket
and
chain
from
his
shield
am
i
to
keep
it
always
fair
princess

indeed
she
answered
laughingly
holding
out
her
hand
to
take
it
papa
jack
gave
me
that
and
i
would
give
it
up
to
any
knight
undah
the
sun
that
right
little
daughter
whispered
her
father
i
am
not
in
such
a
hurry
to
give
up
my
princess
winsome
as
the
old
king
was
come

help
me
find
betty
i
want
to
tell
her
what
a
grand
success
it
was
lloyd
slipped
a
hand
in
her
father
and
led
him
toward
a
wing
whither
the
shy
little
godmother
had
fled
without
a
glance
in
malcolm
direction
but
afterward
when
she
came
out
of
the
wrapped
in
her
long
she
saw
him
standing
by
the
door
good
night
he
said
waving
his
plumed
helmet
then
with
a
mischievous
smile
he
sang
in
an
undertone
go
bid
the
princess
in
the
tower
forget
all
thought
of
sorrow
her
true
knight
will
return
to
her
with
joy
on
some
glad
morrow
chapter

in
camp
several
miles
from
lloydsboro
valley
where
a
rapid
brook
runs
by
the
ruins
of
an
old
a
roaring
waterfall
foams
and
splashes
even
in
the
long
droughts
of
midsummer
it
is
green
and
cool
there
for
the
spray
breaking
on
the
slippery
stones
freshens
the
ferns
on
the
bank
and
turns
its
moss
to
the
vivid
hue
of
an
emerald
near
by
in
an
open
pasture
sloping
down
from
a
circle
of
wooded
hills
lies
an
ideal
spot
for
a
small
camp
it
was
here
that
walton
and
miss
allison
came
one
warm
afternoon
the
monday
following
the
entertainment
with
a
wagonette
full
of
children
ranald
malcolm
keith
and
rob
moore
had
ridden
over
earlier
in
the
day
to
superintend
the
coloured
men
who
dug
the
trenches
and
pitched
the
tents
by
the
time
the
wagonette
arrived
fuel
enough
to
last
a
week
was
piled
near
the
stones
where
the
was
laid
and
everything
was
in
readiness
for
the
gay
party
flags
floated
from
the
tent
poles
and
dinah
the
young
coloured
woman
who
was
to
be
the
cook
came
up
from
the
spring
balancing
a
pail
of
water
on
her
head
smiling
broadly
as
the
boys
and
girls
swarmed
out
and
scurried
away
in
every
direction
like
a
horde
of
busy
ants
walton
turned
to
her
sister
with
a
laugh
did
we
lose
any
of
them
on
the
way
allison
we
better
count
noses
no
we
are
all
here
eight
girls
four
boys
the
four
already
on
the
field
dinah
and
her
baby
and
ourselves
twenty
in
all
counting
hero
corrected
walton
as
the
great
bernard
went
leaping
after
lloyd
sniffing
at
the
tents
and
barking
occasionally
to
express
his
interest
in
the
frolic
he
seems
to
be
enjoying
it
as
much
as
any
of
us
i
wish
that
they
were
all
as
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
as
he
is
it
would
save
us
a
world
of
anxiety
do
you
begin
to
realise
mary
what
a
load
of
responsibility
we
have
taken
on
our
shoulders
sixteen
boys
and
girls
to
keep
out
of
harm
way
for
a
week
in
the
woods
is
no
easy
matter
we
keep
them
so
busy
that
they
have
no
time
for
mischief
the
wagonette
is
unloaded
yet
wait
till
you
see
the
games
i
brought
and
the
there
an
old
curtain
that
can
be
hung
between
those
two
trees
any
time
we
want
to
play
charades
swing
that
hammock
over
there
ranald
she
called
nodding
to
a
clump
of
trees
near
the
spring
then
some
of
you
boys
can
carry
this
chest
back
to
dinah
she
pointed
to
the
old
army
that
always
accompanied
them
on
their
picnics
and
outings
the
ogre
can
do
that
said
the
little
captain
nodding
toward
joe
clark
who
stood
leaning
lazily
against
a
tree
do
it
yourself
fearsome
retorted
joe
at
the
same
time
coming
forward
to
help
carry
the
chest
to
the
place
assigned
it
they
never
be
able
to
get
away
from
those
names
said
miss
allison
well
what
is
it
my
princess
winsome
she
asked
as
lloyd
came
running
up
to
her
please
take
care
of
these
for
me
miss
allison
answered
lloyd
holding
out
hero
which
she
had
just
taken
from
him
i
put
on
his
things
when
we
started
for
mothah
says
nobody
evah
knows
what
goin
to
happen
in
camp
and
we
might
need
those
bandages
tumbling
them
into
miss
allison
lap
she
was
off
again
in
breathless
haste
to
follow
the
other
girls
who
were
exploring
the
tents
and
exclaiming
over
all
the
queer
of
camp
life
then
they
raced
down
to
the
waterfall
and
taking
off
shoes
and
stockings
waded
up
and
down
in
the
brook
these
early
fall
days
were
as
warm
as
august
so
wading
was
not
yet
one
of
the
forbidden
pastimes
they
splashed
up
and
down
until
the
little
bugle
sent
a
ringing
call
for
their
return
to
camp
katie
was
one
of
the
last
to
leave
the
water
lloyd
waited
for
her
while
she
hurriedly
laced
her
shoes
and
as
they
followed
the
others
she
said
in
a
confidential
tone
do
you
think
you
are
goin
to
like
to
stay
out
heah
till
next
like
it
echoed
katie
i
could
stay

year
but

mean
sleepin
in
those
narrow
little
cots
with
ovah
ou

snake
or
a

it
rustlin
around
in
the
grass
undah
you
there
suah
to
be
bugs
and
ants
and
cattahpillahs
i
like
camp
in
the
daylight
but
it
would
be
moah
comfortable
to
have
a
house
to
sleep
in
at
night
i
wish
i
could
wish
myself
back
home
till
mawnin
i
do
mind
the
bugs
and
spiders
said
katie
recklessly
and
better
not
let
the
boys
find
out
that
you
do
or
they
never
stop
teasing
you
a
bountifully
spread
met
their
sight
as
they
reached
the
camp
it
had
been
made
by
laying
long
boards
across
two
poles
which
were
supported
by
forked
stakes
driven
into
the
ground
the
eight
girls
made
a
rush
for
the
on
one
side
of
the
table
and
the
eight
boys
grabbed
those
on
the
other
side
do
have
to
have
no
manners
in
the
woods
remarked
little
freddy
nicholls
straddling
his
stool
and
beginning
his
supper
regardless
of
the
knife
and
fork
beside
his
plate
that
what
i
like
about
camping
out
you
do
have
to
wait
to
have
things
handed
to
you
but
can
dip
in
and
get
what
you
want
like
an
injun
lloyd
looked
at
him
scornfully
as
she
daintily
unfolded
her
paper
napkin
she
nodded
a
decided
yes
when
katie
whispered
are
boys
horrid
and
greedy
then
she
corrected
herself
hastily
she
had
seen
malcolm
wait
to
pass
a
dish
of
fried
chicken
to
his
aunt
allison
before
helping
himself
and
heard
ranald
apologise
to
his
next
neighbour
for
accidentally
jogging
his
elbow
not
all
of
them
she
replied
it
added
much
to
betty
interest
in
the
meal
to
know
that
the
cup
from
which
she
drank
and
the
fork
with
which
she
ate
had
been
used
by
real
soldiers
and
carried
from
one
army
post
to
another
many
times
in
the
old
mess
chest
little
elise
was
the
only
one
who
did
not
give
due
attention
to
her
supper
she
sat
with
a
cooky
in
her
hand
looking
off
at
the
hills
with
dreamy
eyes
until
her
mother
spoke
to
her
i
am
trying
to
make
some
poetry
like
betty
did
she
answered
ever
since
the
play
her
thoughts
seemed
trying
to
twist
themselves
into
rhymes
and
she
was
constantly
coming
up
to
her
mother
with
a
new
verse
she
had
just
made
well
what
is
it
titania
asked
walton
seeing
from
the
gleam
of
satisfaction
in
the
black
eyes
that
the
verse
was
ready
it
all
of
our
names
she
said
shyly
waving
her
hand
toward
the
girls
on
her
side
of
the
table
betty
corinne
and
lloyd
margery
kitty
and
kate
allison
and
elise
all
together
make
eight
oh
that
easy
said
rob
you
just
strung
a
lot
of
names
together
anybody
can
do
that
you
do
it
then
proposed
kitty
make
a
verse
with
the
boys
names
in
it
malcolm
ranald
and
rob
jamie
freddy
keith
he
began
boldly
then
hesitated
there
is
any
rhyme
for
keith
change
them
around
suggested
malcolm
the
girls
would
not
help
and
the
whole
row
of
boys
floundered
among
the
names
for
a
while
unwilling
to
be
beaten
by
the
youngest
member
of
the
party
and
a
girl
at
that
finally
by
their
united
efforts
and
a
hint
from
miss
allison
they
succeeded
malcolm
ranald
and
rob
keith
and
freddy
and
james
joe
the
ogre
and
george
those
are
the
boys
eight
names
let
make
a
law
suggested
kitty
that
nobody
at
the
table
can
say
anything
from
now
on
till
we
are
through
supper
unless
they
speak
in
rhymes
they
all
agreed
but
for
a
few
minutes
no
one
ventured
a
remark
only
giggles
broke
the
silence
until
allison
asked
freddy
nicholls
to
pass
the
pickles
recorded
here
in
a
book
it
may
seem
a
very
silly
game
but
to
the
jolly
camping
party
ready
to
laugh
at
even
the
sheerest
nonsense
it
proved
to
be
the
source
of
much
fun
even
freddy
to
his
own
great
delight
surprised
himself
and
the
company
by
asking
elise
to
take
some
cheese
joe
was
thrown
into
confusion
by
kitty
asking
him
if
flesh
fowl
or
fish
was
his
favourite
dish
as
he
could
only
nod
his
head
he
had
to
pay
a
forfeit
and
keith
answered
for
him
by
saying
that
not
a
fair
question
to
joe
an
ogre
eats
all
things
you
know
so
it
went
on
until
walton
said
now
all
who
are
able
may
rise
from
the
table
the
burning
bright
spread
rugs
on
the
ground
and
gather
around
and
we
all
tell
tales
in
its
light
this
is
the
jolliest
part
of
it
all
exclaimed
keith
a
little
later
as
stretched
out
on
a
thick
indian
blanket
he
looked
around
on
the
circle
of
faces
glowing
in
the
light
of
the
leaping
twilight
had
settled
on
the
camp
the
tumbling
of
the
waterfall
over
the
rocks
made
a
subdued
roar
in
the
background
an
owl
called
somewhere
from
the
depths
of
the
woods
as
the
dismal
tu
sounded
through
the
gloaming
lloyd
glanced
over
her
shoulder
with
a
shudder
ugh
she
exclaimed
it
looks
as
if
the
witch
orchard
might
be
there
behind
us
with
all
sorts
of
snaky
crawlin
things
in
it
come
heah
hero
let
me
put
my
back
against
you
it
makes
me
feel
shivery
to
even
think
of
such
a
thing
the
dog
edged
nearer
at
her
call
and
she
snuggled
up
against
his
tawny
curls
with
a
feeling
of
warmth
and
protection
wish
i
had
a
dog
like
that
said
jamie
fondly
stroking
the
silky
ear
that
was
nearest
him
i
would
take
a
thousand
dollars
for
him
if
i
had
money
could
buy
hero
exclaimed
lloyd
now
what
would
you
do
said
kitty
who
was
always
supposing
impossible
things
if
some
old
witch
would
come
to
you
and
say
may
have
your
choice
a
palace
full
of
gold
and
silver
and
precious
stones
and
give
up
hero
or
keep
him
and
be
a
beggar
in
rags
i
be
a
beggah
of
cried
lloyd
warmly
throwing
her
arm
around
the
dog
neck
think
i
go
back
on
anybody
that
had
saved
my
life
but
i
would
stay
a
beggah
she
continued
i
put
on
the
red
cross
too
and
we
go
away
where
there
was
war
hero
and
i
and
we
spend
ou
lives
takin
care
of
the
soldiahs
i
would
have
to
dress
in
rags
for
weah
the
nurse
costume
and
i
do
so
much
good
that
some
day
may
be
somebody
would
send
me
the
gold
cross
of
remembrance
as
they
did
clara
barton
and
i
suah
that
i
rathah
have
that
with
all
it
means
than
all
the
precious
stones
and
things
that
the
witch
could
give
me
when
did
hero
save
your
life
asked
joe
who
had
not
heard
the
story
of
the
runaway
in
geneva
tell
us
all
about
it
lloyd
asked
walton
so
lloyd
began
and
the
group
around
the
fire
listened
with
breathless
attention
and
that
was
followed
by
the
major
story
and
all
he
had
told
her
of
bernard
dogs
and
of
the
red
cross
service
then
the
finding
of
the
major
by
his
faithful
dog
on
the
dark
mountain
after
the
storm
betty
turn
came
next
she
repeated
some
of
the
stories
they
had
heard
on
shipboard
walton
added
her
part
afterward
telling
her
personal
experience
with
the
red
cross
work
in
cuba
and
the
philippines
that
is
one
reason
i
took
such
a
deep
interest
in
your
little
entertainment
she
said
and
was
so
pleased
when
it
brought
so
much
money
i
know
that
every
penny
under
the
wise
direction
of
the
red
cross
will
help
to
make
some
poor
soldier
more
comfortable
or
if
some
sudden
calamity
should
come
in
this
country
before
it
was
sent
away
your
little
fund
might
help
to
save
dozens
of
lives
the
fire
had
burned
low
while
they
talked
and
elise
was
yawning
sleepily
miss
allison
looked
at
her
watch
how
the
time
has
flown
she
exclaimed
in
surprise
where
is
the
bugler
of
this
camp
it
is
high
time
for
him
to
play
taps
ranald
ran
for
his
bugle
and
the
clear
call
that
he
had
learned
to
play
when
he
was
the
little
captain
in
luzon
rang
out
into
the
dark
woods
it
was
answered
by
the
same
silvery
notes
walton
and
miss
allison
looked
at
each
other
in
surprise
for
the
reply
was
no
echo
but
the
call
of
a
real
bugle
somewhere
not
far
away
oh
we
forgot
to
tell
you
aunt
mary
said
malcolm
noting
the
surprised
glance
it
a
regiment
of
the
state
guard
in
camp
over
by
cliff
we
boys
were
over
there
this
morning
they
made
a
big
fuss
over
us
when
they
found
that
ranald
was
general
walton
son
and
we
were
his
nephews
they
wanted
us
to
stay
to
dinner
and
when
they
found
out
that
you
were
coming
to
camp
here
the
colonel
said
be
wanted
to
come
over
here
and
call
he
used
to
know
you
out
west
colonel
wayne
repeated
walton
when
malcolm
finally
remembered
the
name
we
knew
him
when
he
was
only
a
young
cadet
at
west
point
the
general
was
very
fond
of
him
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
him
again
they
be
interested
in
hero
said
ranald
maybe
they
want
to
train
some
war
dogs
for
our
army
if
they
set
him
at
work
do
you
suppose
he
has
forgotten
his
training
lloyd
let
try
him
in
the
morning
you
can
make
a
great
game
of
it
suggested
walton
rig
up
one
of
the
tents
for
a
hospital
some
of
the
boys
can
be
wounded
soldiers
and
some
of
the
girls
nurses
all
but
me
said
lloyd
i
have
to
be
an
officer
to
give
the
ordahs
he
only
knows
the
french
words
for
that
and
the
majah
taught
them
to
me
what
can
we
use
for
the
brassards
and
costumes
said
kitty
elise
has
an
old
red
apron
in
the
that
we
can
cut
up
for
crosses
said
walton
always
ready
for
emergencies
but
now
to
your
tents
every
man
of
you
or
you
never
be
ready
to
get
up
in
the
morning
it
was
hard
to
go
to
sleep
in
the
midst
of
such
strange
surroundings
and
more
than
once
lloyd
started
up
aroused
by
the
hoot
of
an
owl
or
the
thud
of
a
bat
against
the
side
of
the
tent
not
until
she
reached
out
and
laid
her
hand
on
the
great
bernard
stretched
out
beside
her
cot
did
she
settle
herself
comfortably
to
sleep
with
the
touch
of
his
soft
curls
against
her
fingers
she
was
no
longer
afraid
when
the
officers
came
into
the
camp
next
day
they
found
the
children
in
the
midst
of
their
new
game
it
was
some
time
before
their
attention
was
attracted
to
it
for
the
colonel
was
one
of
the
men
who
had
followed
general
walton
on
his
long
hard
indian
campaign
and
there
were
many
questions
to
be
asked
and
answered
about
mutual
friends
in
the
army
hero
was
not
making
a
serious
business
of
the
game
but
was
entering
into
it
as
if
it
were
a
big
frolic
he
could
not
make
believe
as
the
boys
could
who
played
at
soldiering
but
the
old
words
of
command
uttered
in
the
little
colonel
high
excited
voice
sent
him
bounding
in
the
direction
she
pointed
and
the
prostrate
forms
he
found
scattered
about
the
sham
battle
field
seemed
to
quicken
his
memory
walton
presently
called
the
officer
attention
to
the
efforts
hero
was
making
to
recall
his
old
lessons
and
briefly
outlined
his
history
i
believe
he
would
remember
perfectly
said
the
colonel
watching
him
with
deep
interest
if
we
were
to
take
him
over
to
our
camp
and
try
him
among
the
regular
uniformed
soldiers
of
course
our
accoutrements
are
not
the
kind
he
has
been
accustomed
to
but
i
think
they
would
suggest
them
at
least
the
smell
of
powder
would
be
familiar
and
the
guns
and
canteens
and
knapsacks
might
awaken
something
in
his
memory
that
would
revive
his
entire
training
i
should
like
very
much
to
make
the
experiment
after
some
further
conversation
lloyd
was
called
up
to
meet
the
officers
and
it
was
agreed
that
hero
should
be
taken
over
to
the
camp
for
a
trial
on
the
day
the
sham
battle
was
to
take
place
the
day
has
not
yet
been
definitely
determined
said
the
colonel
but
i
send
you
word
as
soon
as
it
is
by
the
way
my
orderly
was
once
a
young
french
officer
and
often
talks
of
the
french
army
he
welcome
hero
like
a
brother
for
he
has
a
soft
spot
in
his
heart
for
anything
connected
with
his
motherland
ill
send
him
over
either
this
evening
or
that
evening
the
orderly
rode
over
to
bring
word
that
the
sham
battle
would
take
place
the
following
thursday
and
they
were
all
invited
to
witness
it
hero
trial
would
take
place
immediately
after
the
battle
while
he
stood
talking
to
walton
and
miss
allison
lloyd
and
kitty
came
running
down
the
hill
with
hero
close
behind
them
the
orderly
turned
with
an
exclamation
of
admiration
as
the
dog
came
toward
him
and
held
out
his
hand
with
a
friendly
snap
of
the
fingers
ah
old
comrade
he
called
out
in
french
in
a
deep
hearty
voice
come
give
me
a
greeting
i
too
am
from
the
motherland
at
sound
of
the
familiar
speech
the
dog
went
forward
wagging
his
tail
violently
as
if
he
recognised
an
old
acquaintance
then
he
stopped
and
snuffed
his
boots
in
a
puzzled
manner
and
looked
up
wistfully
into
the
orderly
face
it
was
a
stranger
he
gazed
at
yet
voice
speech
and
appearance
were
like
the
man
who
had
trained
him
from
a
puppy
and
he
gave
a
wriggle
of
pleasure
when
the
big
hand
came
down
on
his
head
and
the
deep
voice
spoke
caressingly
to
him
when
the
orderly
mounted
his
horse
hero
would
have
followed
had
not
the
little
colonel
called
him
sharply
grieved
and
jealous
that
he
should
show
such
marked
interest
in
a
stranger
he
turned
back
at
her
call
but
stood
in
the
road
looking
after
his
friend
till
horse
and
rider
disappeared
down
the
that
led
through
the
deep
woods
to
the
other
camp
chapter
xv
the
sentry
mistake
promptly
on
thursday
at
the
time
appointed
the
orderly
rode
over
to
camp
walton
to
escort
the
party
back
to
the
camp
at
calkin
cliff
the
four
boys
led
the
way
on
their
ponies
the
rest
piled
into
a
great
farm
wagon
filled
with
straw
that
had
been
procured
from
one
of
the
neighbouring
farms
for
the
occasion
hero
followed
obediently
when
the
little
colonel
ordered
him
to
jump
up
beside
her
but
he
turned
longing
eyes
on
the
orderly
whom
he
had
welcomed
with
strong
marks
of
pleasure
it
was
only
their
second
meeting
but
hero
seemed
to
regard
him
as
an
old
friend
he
leaped
up
to
lick
his
face
and
bounded
around
him
with
quick
short
barks
of
pleasure
that
for
the
moment
gave
lloyd
a
jealous
pang
she
was
hurt
that
hero
should
show
such
an
evident
desire
to
follow
him
in
preference
to
her
i
do
see
what
makes
hero
act
so
she
said
to
walton
the
orderly
certainly
must
bear
a
strong
resemblance
to
some
one
whom
hero
knew
and
loved
in
france
she
replied
you
have
owned
him
less
than
two
months
and
he
has
been
away
from
france
only
a
year
you
must
remember
everything
must
seem
strange
to
him
here
he
was
not
brought
up
to
play
with
children
as
many
bernards
are
the
other
night
at
the
entertainment
i
wondered
many
times
what
hero
must
think
of
his
strange
surroundings
his
life
here
is
different
in
every
way
from
all
that
he
has
been
used
to
a
dog
trained
from
puppyhood
to
the
experiences
of
soldier
life
would
naturally
miss
the
excitement
of
camp
as
much
as
a
soldier
suddenly
retired
to
the
life
of
a
private
citizen
oh
deah
sighed
lloyd
i
wish
he
could
talk
i
ask
him
if
he
is
unhappy
you
homesick
old
fellow
she
took
his
great
head
between
her
little
hands
and
looked
earnestly
into
his
eyes
as
she
asked
the
question
you
wish
you
were
back
in
the
french
army
following
the
ambulances
and
hunting
the
wounded
soldiahs
seems
to
me
you
ought
to
like
it
so
much
bettah
heah
in
kentucky
with
nothing
to
do
but
play
and
eat
and
sleep
and
be
loved
by
everybody
but
an
army
dog
ca
get
away
from
his
training
any
easier
than
a
man
laughed
the
orderly
as
he
rode
on
beside
the
wagon
it
is
a
part
of
him
hero
is
a
good
soldier
and
no
doubt
feels
a
greater
joy
in
obeying
what
he
considers
a
call
to
duty
than
in
riding
in
the
wagon
at
his
ease
with
the
ladies
you
know
a
great
deal
perhaps
of
this
society
for
the
training
of
ambulance
dogs
said
walton
yes
he
replied
i
am
deeply
interested
in
it
my
brother
at
home
keeps
me
informed
of
its
movements
and
has
written
me
much
of
herr
methods
i
think
i
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
putting
the
dog
through
his
manoeuvres
especially
as
he
seems
to
recognise
me
and
in
some
way
connect
me
with
his
past
life
fife
and
drum
welcomed
the
party
as
they
drove
into
camp
and
the
party
were
at
once
escorted
to
seats
where
they
could
watch
the
drill
and
the
sham
battle
it
was
a
familiar
scene
to
the
general
little
family
and
to
miss
allison
who
had
visited
more
than
one
army
post
but
some
of
the
girls
put
their
fingers
in
their
ears
when
the
noise
of
the
rapid
firing
began
hero
was
greatly
excited
soon
after
the
noise
of
the
sham
battle
ceased
the
field
was
prepared
for
the
dog
trial
men
were
hidden
behind
logs
stretched
out
in
ditches
and
left
lying
as
if
dead
in
the
dense
thicket
that
skirted
one
side
of
the
field
for
wounded
animals
either
men
or
beasts
instinctively
crawl
away
to
die
under
cover
with
hands
almost
trembling
in
their
eagerness
lloyd
fastened
the
flask
and
on
the
dog
he
seemed
to
know
that
something
unusual
was
expected
of
him
and
wagged
his
tail
so
violently
that
he
nearly
upset
the
little
colonel
he
watched
every
movement
of
the
orderly
who
with
a
red
cross
brassard
on
his
arm
was
acting
as
chief
of
the
improvised
ambulance
corps
will
you
give
him
the
order
miss
lloyd
he
asked
turning
politely
to
the
little
girl
lloyd
had
pictured
this
moment
several
times
on
the
way
over
thinking
how
proud
she
would
be
to
stand
up
like
a
real
little
colonel
and
send
her
orders
ringing
over
the
field
before
the
whole
admiring
regiment
but
now
that
the
moment
had
actually
come
she
blushed
and
shrank
back
timidly
she
was
not
sure
that
she
could
say
the
strange
french
words
just
as
the
major
had
taught
them
to
her
when
such
a
crowd
of
soldiers
were
standing
by
to
hear
oh
do
it
please
she
asked
if
you
will
tell
me
the
exact
words
he
has
been
accustomed
to
hearing
answered
the
orderly
lloyd
stammered
them
out
greatly
embarrassed
feeling
that
her
pronunciation
must
have
grown
quite
faulty
from
lack
of
practice
under
the
major
careful
training
the
orderly
repeated
them
in
an
undertone
then
turning
to
hero
gave
the
order
in
a
clear
deep
voice
that
seemed
to
thrill
the
dog
with
its
familiar
ring
instantly
at
the
sound
he
started
out
across
the
field
not
a
thing
that
had
been
taught
him
in
his
long
careful
training
was
forgotten
the
first
man
he
found
was
lying
in
a
ditch
apparently
desperately
wounded
hero
allowed
him
to
help
himself
from
his
flask
and
drag
a
bandage
from
the
bags
on
his
back
then
standing
with
his
hind
feet
in
the
ditch
and
his
fore
feet
resting
on
the
bank
above
him
he
gave
voice
until
the
men
by
the
ambulance
heard
him
and
came
toward
him
carrying
a
stretcher
look
at
him
exclaimed
walton
who
with
the
party
and
several
of
the
officers
had
walked
down
to
the
hospital
tent
he
knows
he
has
done
his
duty
well
did
you
ever
see
a
dog
manifest
such
delight
he
fairly
wriggles
with
joy
the
praise
of
the
men
bearing
the
stretcher
and
especially
of
the
orderly
seemed
to
send
the
dog
into
a
transport
of
happiness
the
second
man
lay
far
on
the
outskirts
of
the
field
hidden
by
a
thicket
of
hazel
bushes
this
time
hero
frantic
barking
brought
no
reply
the
men
acted
as
if
deaf
to
his
appeals
of
help
so
in
a
few
minutes
evidently
thinking
they
were
beyond
the
range
of
his
voice
he
picked
up
the
man
cap
in
his
mouth
and
ran
back
at
the
top
of
his
speed
good
dog
said
the
orderly
taking
the
cap
he
dropped
at
his
feet
go
back
now
and
lead
the
way
if
that
man
had
really
been
wounded
and
had
crawled
under
that
thicket
said
colonel
wayne
we
never
could
have
found
him
alone
only
the
sense
of
smell
could
lead
to
such
a
the
ambulance
might
have
passed
there
a
hundred
times
and
never
seen
a
trace
of
him
the
hunt
went
on
for
some
time
before
it
closed
every
man
personating
a
killed
or
wounded
soldier
was
located
and
carried
to
the
hospital
tent
when
the
tired
dog
was
finally
allowed
to
rest
he
dropped
down
at
the
orderly
feet
panting
that
was
certainly
fine
work
said
the
colonel
stooping
to
pat
sides
i
suppose
nothing
could
induce
you
to
give
him
up
to
the
army
he
asked
turning
to
lloyd
oh
no
no
no
cried
lloyd
as
if
alarmed
at
the
suggestion
and
pressing
hero
head
protectingly
against
her
shoulder
if
she
had
been
proud
of
him
before
she
was
doubly
proud
of
him
now
he
had
won
the
admiration
of
the
entire
regiment
never
had
he
been
so
praised
and
petted
when
walton
called
her
party
together
for
their
homeward
drive
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
hero
was
loath
to
leave
the
camp
a
word
from
the
orderly
would
have
kept
him
despite
lloyd
commands
to
jump
up
into
the
wagon
as
the
boys
rode
on
ahead
again
keith
said
it
does
seem
too
bad
to
force
that
dog
into
being
a
private
citizen
when
he
is
a
born
soldier
did
you
hear
what
colonel
wayne
told
mamma
as
we
left
asked
ranald
he
told
her
that
it
was
reported
that
some
of
the
animals
had
escaped
from
the
circus
that
was
in
louisville
yesterday
and
that
a
panther
and
some
other
kind
of
a
beast
had
been
seen
in
these
woods
he
laughed
and
asked
her
if
she
did
want
him
to
send
a
guard
over
to
our
camp
of
course
he
was
only
joking
but
when
she
saw
that
i
had
heard
what
he
said
she
told
me
not
to
tell
the
girls
not
to
even
mention
such
a
thing
or
they
be
so
frightened
they
want
to
break
camp
and
go
straight
home
it
would
be
fun
to
scare
them
said
rob
but
you
better
believe
not
say
anything
if
there
any
danger
of
having
to
go
home
sooner
on
account
of
it
we
got
to
go
day
after
anyhow
said
keith
gloomily
i
wish
i
could
miss
another
week
of
school
but
i
know
papa
would
let
me
even
if
the
camp
did
break
up
come
on
called
ranald
who
had
pushed
on
ahead
let
hurry
back
and
have
a
good
swim
before
supper
not
satisfied
with
the
excitement
of
the
day
the
girls
were
no
sooner
out
of
the
wagon
than
some
one
started
a
wild
game
of
prisoners
base
then
they
played
among
the
rocks
and
trees
around
the
waterfall
and
while
they
were
wiping
their
flushed
faces
panting
after
the
long
run
kitty
proposed
that
they
should
have
a
candy
pulling
dinah
made
the
candy
but
the
girls
pulled
it
running
a
race
to
see
whose
would
be
the
whitest
in
a
given
time
their
arms
ached
long
before
they
were
done
by
the
time
the
boys
came
stumbling
up
the
hill
from
their
long
swim
in
the
creek
it
would
be
hard
to
say
which
group
was
most
tired
i
sure
we
all
want
to
turn
in
early
said
walton
at
supper
freddy
was
yawning
widely
and
elise
was
almost
asleep
over
her
plate
you
are
all
tired
all
but
hero
said
miss
allison
offering
him
a
chicken
bone
he
rested
while
the
others
played
you
like
to
go
through
your
game
every
day
would
you
old
boy
there
was
no
around
the
that
night
they
gathered
around
it
even
before
the
light
died
out
in
the
sky
ranald
had
his
guitar
and
allison
her
mandolin
and
they
thrummed
accompaniments
awhile
for
the
others
to
sing
but
a
mighty
yawn
catching
margery
in
the
middle
of
a
verse
and
walton
discovering
both
jamie
and
freddy
sound
asleep
on
the
rug
beside
her
she
proposed
that
they
all
go
to
bed
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
the
little
captain
vowed
he
was
too
sleepy
to
blow
a
single
toot
on
his
bugle
so
they
went
to
their
tents
without
the
usual
sounding
of
taps
it
was
not
long
before
every
child
was
asleep
worn
out
by
the
day
hard
play
walton
lay
awake
sometime
listening
to
the
sounds
outside
the
tent
the
crackling
of
underbrush
and
rustle
of
dry
leaves
was
familiar
enough
in
the
daytime
but
they
seemed
strangely
ominous
now
that
the
lights
were
out
she
could
not
help
thinking
of
what
the
colonel
had
told
her
of
the
escaped
panther
she
imagined
the
panic
it
would
make
if
it
should
suddenly
appear
in
their
midst
then
she
thought
of
protecting
presence
and
raising
herself
on
her
elbow
she
looked
across
the
tent
to
where
she
knew
he
lay
asleep
at
first
she
could
not
see
even
the
ruff
of
white
that
made
the
collar
around
his
tawny
throat
for
the
moon
had
slipped
behind
a
cloud
but
as
she
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
and
peered
intently
through
the
darkness
the
faint
misty
light
shone
out
again
and
she
saw
hero
plainly
the
little
colonel
outstretched
hand
resting
on
his
broad
back
then
she
lay
down
again
this
time
to
sleep
and
soon
all
the
little
camp
was
wrapped
in
the
peace
and
rest
of
perfect
silence
half
an
hour
later
hero
lifted
his
head
from
between
his
paws
and
listened
something
seemed
calling
him
he
did
not
know
what
being
only
a
dog
he
could
not
analyse
the
thoughts
passing
through
his
brain
a
restlessness
seized
him
he
longed
to
be
back
among
the
familiar
sights
and
sounds
of
soldier
life
this
little
play
camp
where
children
tried
to
make
him
romp
continually
was
not
home
locust
was
not
home
this
strange
new
country
full
of
unfamiliar
faces
and
foreign
voices
was
not
home
but
the
orderly
voice
reminded
him
of
it
over
there
were
bearded
men
and
deep
voices
and
strong
hands
guns
and
the
smell
of
powder
fife
and
drum
and
canteens
and
knapsacks
things
that
he
had
seen
daily
in
his
soldier
life
was
it
some
call
to
duty
that
thrilled
him
or
only
a
homesick
longing
as
he
listened
with
head
up
there
came
ringing
clear
and
silvery
through
the
night
the
bugle
notes
from
the
other
camp
at
the
first
sound
hero
was
on
his
feet
he
moved
noiselessly
toward
the
tent
flap
only
partially
fastened
and
flattening
himself
against
the
ground
wriggled
out
and
if
he
gave
no
thought
to
the
little
mistress
dreaming
inside
the
tent
if
he
left
without
regret
the
life
of
ease
and
loving
care
to
which
she
had
brought
him
it
was
not
because
he
was
ungrateful
but
because
he
did
not
understand
to
him
his
old
life
woke
and
called
him
in
the
blowing
to
him
duty
did
not
mean
soft
cushions
and
idle
days
and
the
following
of
a
child
at
play
it
meant
long
marches
and
the
guarding
of
ambulances
and
the
rescue
of
the
dead
and
dying
a
true
soldier
heart
beat
in
the
dog
shaggy
body
and
obedient
to
his
instinct
and
training
he
answered
the
summons
when
it
sounded
with
long
swinging
steps
he
set
out
in
the
direction
of
the
taking
the
road
through
the
woods
that
the
wagon
had
travelled
that
day
and
down
which
he
had
watched
the
orderly
disappear
no
not
deserting
his
duty
but
as
he
understood
it
hurrying
back
with
faithful
heart
to
the
cause
that
had
always
claimed
him
now
and
then
the
moon
coming
out
fitfully
from
behind
the
clouds
shone
on
his
great
tawny
body
touching
the
white
curls
of
his
ruff
with
a
line
of
silver
then
he
would
be
lost
in
darkness
again
but
he
swung
on
unerringly
until
he
was
almost
in
sight
of
the
camp
a
little
farther
on
a
sentry
paced
up
and
down
the
that
ran
along
the
edge
of
the
woods
hero
travelled
on
toward
him
the
dry
dead
leaves
rustling
under
his
paws
and
now
and
then
a
twig
crackling
with
his
weight
the
sentry
paused
and
listened
wondering
what
kind
of
an
animal
was
coming
toward
him
in
the
darkness
halt
who
goes
there
he
called
sharply
the
moon
peeping
out
at
that
instant
seemed
to
magnify
the
size
of
the
great
creature
in
his
path
he
thought
of
the
panther
and
the
other
wild
beast
whatever
it
was
supposed
to
be
roaming
about
in
the
woods
then
the
moon
disappeared
as
suddenly
as
it
had
lighted
up
the
scene
and
the
big
paws
still
pattered
on
toward
him
in
the
darkness
regardless
of
his
repeated
challenge
as
the
underbrush
crackled
again
with
the
weight
of
the
great
body
now
almost
upon
him
the
sentry
raised
his
rifle
a
shot
rang
out
arousing
the
camp
not
yet
fully
settled
to
sleep
the
echo
bounded
back
from
the
startled
hills
and
rolled
away
over
the
peaceful
farms
and
orchards
growing
fainter
and
fainter
until
only
a
whisper
of
it
reached
the
white
tent
where
the
little
colonel
lay
dreaming
then
the
moon
shone
out
again
and
the
sentry
going
a
few
paces
forward
looked
down
in
horror
at
the
silent
form
stretched
out
at
his
feet
chapter
xvi
taps
the
corporal
of
the
guard
went
running
in
the
direction
of
the
shot
and
here
and
there
an
inquiring
head
was
thrust
out
of
a
tent
only
a
dog
shot
sir
he
was
heard
to
call
out
in
answer
to
some
officer
question
as
he
passed
back
down
the
line
sentry
took
him
for
a
wild
beast
escaped
from
the
show
somebody
laughed
in
reply
and
the
men
who
had
been
aroused
by
the
noise
turned
over
and
went
to
sleep
they
did
not
know
that
the
corporal
hurried
on
down
to
the
and
that
as
a
result
of
his
report
there
was
a
hasty
summons
for
the
surgeon
they
did
not
know
that
it
was
hero
whom
the
sentry
bent
over
gulping
down
a
feeling
in
his
throat
that
nearly
choked
him
as
he
saw
the
blood
welling
out
of
the
dog
shaggy
white
breast
and
slowly
stiffening
the
silky
hair
of
his
beautiful
yellow
coat
the
surgeon
knelt
down
beside
the
dog
and
as
the
clouds
hid
the
moon
again
he
turned
the
light
of
his
lantern
on
the
wound
for
a
careful
examination
that
was
a
cracking
good
shot
bently
he
said
he
never
knew
what
stopped
him
the
sentry
turned
his
head
away
i
would
have
been
the
one
to
take
that
dog
life
for
anything
in
the
world
he
exclaimed
i
pretty
near
as
soon
have
killed
a
man
it
never
entered
my
head
that
any
tame
animal
would
come
leaping
out
of
the
woods
that
way
at
this
time
of
night
he
loomed
up
nearly
as
big
as
a
lion
when
the
moon
shone
out
on
him
the
next
minute
it
was
all
dark
again
and
i
heard
his
big
soft
feet
come
pattering
through
the
leaves
straight
on
toward
me
it
flashed
over
me
that
it
must
be
one
of
those
escaped
circus
animals
so
i
just
let
loose
and
blazed
away
at
him
the
surgeon
stood
up
and
looked
down
at
the
still
form
at
his
feet
too
bad
he
said
he
was
a
grand
old
dog
the
finest
bernard
i
ever
saw
how
that
little
girl
loved
him
it
will
just
about
break
her
heart
when
she
finds
out
what
happened
to
him
do
begged
the
sentry
huskily
do
say
anything
like
that
i
feel
bad
enough
about
it
now
goodness
knows
without
your
harrowing
up
my
feelings
talking
of
the
way
going
to
feel
as
the
surgeon
started
on
the
sentry
stopped
him
for
heaven
sake
mac
do
leave
him
lying
there
on
the
where
i
got
to
see
him
every
time
i
pass
send
somebody
to
take
him
away
i
all
unnerved
i
feel
as
if
i
shot
one
of
my
own
comrades
the
surgeon
looked
at
him
curiously
and
walked
on
nobody
was
sent
to
take
the
dog
away
but
a
little
while
later
the
sentry
was
relieved
from
duty
and
another
soldier
kept
guard
over
the
silent
camp
pacing
back
and
forth
past
the
red
cross
hero
sleeping
his
last
sleep
under
the
light
of
the
sentinel
stars
somebody
draped
a
flag
across
him
before
the
camp
was
astir
next
morning
well
why
not
the
man
asked
when
he
was
joked
about
paying
so
much
attention
to
a
dead
dog
why
not
he
was
a
war
dog
was
he
it
no
more
than
his
due
i
was
the
man
he
found
in
the
ditch
yesterday
as
far
as
his
intention
and
good
will
went
he
did
as
much
to
save
me
as
if
i
had
been
really
lying
there
a
wounded
soldier
when
he
came
leaping
down
there
into
the
ditch
after
me
licking
my
face
in
such
a
friendly
fashion
and
holding
still
so
that
i
could
help
myself
to
the
flask
and
bandages
i
thought
how
grateful
a
fellow
would
feel
to
him
if
he
were
really
rescued
by
him
that
way
it
was
all
to
me
but
it
was
dead
earnest
to
the
dog
and
he
did
his
part
as
faithfully
as
any
soldier
who
ever
wore
a
uniform
you
right
said
a
young
lieutenant
sitting
near
if
for
no
other
reason
than
that
he
was
in
the
service
of
the
red
cross
he
has
a
right
to
the
respect
of
every
man
that
calls
himself
a
soldier
no
matter
what
flag
he
follows
later
in
the
morning
when
the
orderly
rode
into
the
little
picnic
camp
the
girls
were
away
they
were
down
by
the
waterfall
digging
ferns
and
mosses
to
take
home
we
are
thinking
of
breaking
up
camp
this
afternoon
walton
told
him
the
weather
looks
so
threatening
that
i
have
sent
for
the
wagonette
to
come
for
us
and
i
was
about
to
send
over
to
your
camp
to
see
if
hero
had
wandered
back
there
he
has
not
been
seen
since
last
night
he
was
lying
by
lloyd
cot
just
before
i
went
to
sleep
but
this
morning
he
is
nowhere
to
be
found
lloyd
is
distressed
i
told
her
that
probably
the
drill
yesterday
awakened
all
his
love
for
the
old
life
and
that
he
might
have
been
drawn
back
to
it
was
i
right
have
you
seen
him
yes
said
the
orderly
hesitating
i
saw
him
but
i
find
it
hard
to
tell
you
how
and
where
mrs
walton
he
paused
again
and
then
hurried
on
with
the
explanation
as
if
anxious
to
have
it
over
as
soon
as
possible
he
was
shot
last
night
by
mistake
on
the
the
sentry
is
all
broken
up
over
it
poor
fellow
and
the
whole
camp
regrets
it
more
than
i
can
tell
you
see
after
yesterday
performance
we
almost
claimed
the
dog
as
one
of
us
colonel
wayne
has
made
me
the
bearer
of
his
deepest
regrets
he
especially
deplores
the
occurrence
on
account
of
the
dog
little
mistress
knowing
what
a
great
grief
it
will
be
to
her
he
wishes
if
you
think
it
will
be
any
consolation
to
her
to
give
hero
a
military
funeral
and
bury
him
with
the
honours
due
a
brave
soldier
i
am
sure
that
lloyd
will
want
that
said
mrs
walton
she
will
appreciate
it
deeply
when
she
understands
what
a
mark
of
respect
to
hero
such
an
attention
would
be
tell
colonel
wayne
please
that
i
gladly
accept
the
offer
in
her
behalf
and
will
send
ranald
over
later
to
arrange
for
it
the
orderly
rode
away
and
walton
turned
to
her
sister
exclaiming
poor
little
lloyd
i
confess
i
am
not
brave
enough
to
face
her
grief
when
she
first
hears
the
news
you
will
have
to
tell
her
allison
you
know
her
so
much
better
than
i
we
might
as
well
hurry
the
preparations
for
leaving
no
one
will
care
to
stay
a
moment
longer
now
this
has
happened
it
will
cast
a
gloom
over
the
entire
party
maybe
it
would
be
better
not
to
tell
her
until
after
she
gets
home
suggested
miss
allison
she
had
soothed
the
childish
griefs
of
nearly
every
child
in
the
valley
at
some
time
or
another
but
she
felt
that
this
was
the
most
serious
one
that
had
fallen
to
her
lot
to
comfort
i
sure
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
lloyd
away
from
here
without
hero
unless
she
knew
was
the
answer
i
heard
her
tell
kitty
this
morning
that
nobody
could
make
her
go
without
him
she
said
if
he
was
back
by
the
time
we
were
ready
to
start
we
could
go
on
without
her
and
she
would
hunt
for
him
if
it
took
all
fall
while
they
were
still
discussing
it
the
boys
came
running
back
to
camp
much
excited
they
had
met
the
orderly
oh
the
poor
dog
mourned
keith
what
a
shame
for
the
poor
old
fellow
to
be
shot
down
that
way
it
seems
almost
as
bad
as
if
it
had
been
one
of
us
boys
that
was
killed
ranald
and
rob
joined
in
with
praise
of
his
many
lovable
traits
talking
of
his
death
as
if
it
were
a
lifelong
friend
they
had
lost
but
malcolm
turned
away
with
an
anxious
glance
to
the
woods
where
he
could
hear
the
laughing
voices
of
the
girls
poor
little
princess
winsome
he
thought
it
will
nearly
break
her
heart
and
he
wished
with
all
the
earnestness
of
the
real
sir
feal
that
by
some
knightly
service
no
matter
how
hard
he
could
save
his
little
friend
from
this
sorrow
the
girls
came
strolling
up
presently
so
occupied
with
their
spoils
that
no
one
noticed
the
boy
serious
faces
but
lloyd
the
moment
she
caught
malcolm
sympathetic
glance
she
was
sure
something
had
happened
to
hero
oh
what
is
it
she
began
the
tears
gathering
in
her
eyes
as
she
felt
the
unspoken
sympathy
of
the
little
group
leaving
walton
to
tell
the
other
girls
miss
allison
drew
lloyd
aside
saying
as
she
led
her
down
toward
the
spring
an
arm
around
her
waist
i
have
a
message
for
you
lloyd
from
colonel
wayne
let
go
down
to
the
rocks
by
ourselves
a
sympathetic
silence
fell
on
the
little
circle
left
behind
as
they
heard
lloyd
cry
out
shot
my
dog
shot
oh
he
ought
to
be
killed
how
could
he
do
such
a
cruel
thing
but
he
feels
dreadfully
about
it
said
miss
allison
the
orderly
said
that
big
strong
man
though
he
was
the
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
when
he
saw
what
he
had
done
and
he
kept
saying
would
have
done
it
for
the
world
nearly
all
the
girls
were
crying
by
this
time
and
malcolm
turned
his
head
so
that
he
could
not
see
the
fair
little
head
pressed
against
miss
allison
shoulder
as
she
clung
to
her
sobbing
think
how
it
must
have
hurt
poah
hero
feelin
lloyd
was
saying
to
go
back
to
their
camp
so
trustin
and
happy
thinkin
the
men
would
be
so
glad
to
see
him
and
that
he
was
doin
his
duty
and
then
to
have
one
of
them
stand
up
and
send
a
bullet
through
his
deah
lovin
old
heart
oh
i
ca
it
she
screamed
oh
i
ca
i
ca
it
seems
as
if
it
would
kill
me
to
think
of
him
lyin
ovah
there
all
cold
and
stiff
with
the
blood
on
his
lovely
white
and
yellow
curls
and
know
that
he
nevah
nevah
again
jump
up
to
lick
my
hands
and
put
his
paws
on
my
shouldahs
he
nevah
come
to
meet
me
any
moah
waggin
his
tail
and
lookin
up
into
my
face
with
his
deah
lovin
eyes
oh
miss
allison
i
ca
stand
it
it
just
breakin
my
heart
burying
her
face
in
miss
allison
lap
she
sobbed
and
cried
until
her
tears
were
all
spent
it
was
a
subdued
little
party
that
rode
back
to
the
valley
a
few
hours
later
not
only
sympathy
for
lloyd
kept
them
quiet
but
each
one
mourned
the
loss
of
the
gentle
lovable
playfellow
who
had
come
to
such
an
untimely
end
after
this
week
of
happy
camp
life
with
them
under
the
locusts
that
evening
just
as
the
sun
was
going
down
came
the
tread
of
many
marching
feet
it
was
the
tramp
tramp
of
the
soldiers
who
were
bringing
home
the
little
colonel
hero
all
the
men
who
had
been
most
interested
in
his
performances
the
day
before
had
volunteered
to
follow
colonel
wayne
and
the
long
line
made
an
imposing
showing
as
it
stretched
up
the
avenue
after
him
lloyd
watched
the
approach
from
her
seat
on
the
porch
beside
her
father
all
the
camping
party
were
waiting
with
her
except
the
four
boys
who
rode
at
the
head
of
the
procession
ranald
and
malcolm
first
then
rob
and
keith
lloyd
hid
her
eyes
as
lad
and
tarbaby
came
into
view
behind
them
look
said
her
father
gently
pointing
to
the
burden
they
drew
how
much
better
it
was
for
hero
to
have
been
shot
by
a
soldier
and
brought
home
with
military
honours
than
to
have
met
the
fate
of
an
ordinary
dog
been
poisoned
or
mangled
by
a
train
as
might
have
happened
or
even
died
of
a
painful
feeble
old
age
the
major
would
have
chosen
this
so
would
hero
if
he
could
have
understood
there
was
more
comfort
in
that
thought
than
in
anything
that
had
been
said
to
her
before
and
lloyd
wiped
her
eyes
and
sat
up
to
watch
the
ceremony
that
followed
with
a
feeling
of
pride
that
made
her
almost
cheerful
on
they
came
to
the
beat
of
the
muffled
drum
halting
under
a
great
that
stood
by
itself
on
the
lawn
in
sight
of
the
library
windows
like
a
giant
sentinel
there
the
boys
dismounted
to
lower
hero
into
the
grave
that
walker
and
alec
had
just
finished
digging
then
the
coloured
men
spreading
the
sod
quickly
back
in
place
stepped
aside
from
the
low
mound
they
had
made
and
lloyd
saw
that
it
was
smooth
and
green
she
started
violently
when
the
soldiers
drawn
up
in
line
fired
a
parting
volley
over
it
but
sat
quietly
back
again
when
the
little
captain
stepped
forward
and
raised
his
bugle
the
sun
was
sinking
low
behind
the
locusts
and
in
the
golden
glow
filling
the
western
sky
he
softly
sounded
taps
lights
out
now
for
the
faithful
old
hero
the
last
that
sounded
for
him
was
in
a
foreign
land
but
it
was
not
as
a
stranger
and
an
alien
they
left
him
the
flag
he
followed
floats
farther
than
the
stars
and
stripes
waves
wider
than
the
banner
of
the
kaiser
it
is
a
flag
that
flag
of
perpetual
peace
which
bears
the
red
cross
of
geneva
in
its
shadow
whether
on
land
or
sea
all
patriot
hearts
are
at
home
and
under
that
flag
they
left
him
a
square
white
stone
stands
now
under
the
locust
where
the
little
captain
sounded
taps
at
the
close
of
that
september
day
on
it
gleams
the
red
cross
in
whose
service
all
of
hero
lessons
had
been
learned
but
the
daily
sight
of
it
from
her
bedroom
window
no
longer
brings
pain
to
the
little
colonel
hero
is
only
a
tender
memory
now
and
she
counts
the
red
cross
above
him
as
another
talisman
like
the
little
ring
and
the
silver
scissors
to
remind
her
that
only
through
unselfish
service
to
others
can
one
reach
the
happiness
that
is
highest
and
best
time
flies
fast
under
the
locusts
sometimes
to
papa
jack
it
seems
only
yesterday
that
she
clattered
up
and
down
the
wide
halls
with
her
grandfather
spurs
buckled
to
her
tiny
feet
but
if
he
misses
the
charm
of
the
baby
voice
that
called
to
him
then
or
the
childish
mischievousness
of
his
little
colonel
he
finds
a
greater
one
in
the
beauty
of
the
tall
slender
girl
who
stands
beside
the
gilded
harp
and
sings
to
him
softly
in
the
and
it
is
betty
song
of
service
that
is
oftenest
on
her
lips
my
godmother
bids
me
spin
that
my
heart
may
not
be
sad
sing
and
spin
for
my
brother
sake
and
the
spinning
makes
me
glad
she
knows
that
she
can
never
be
a
joan
of
arc
or
a
clara
barton
and
her
name
will
never
be
written
in
america
hall
of
fame
but
with
the
sweet
ambition
in
her
heart
to
make
life
a
little
lovelier
for
every
one
she
touches
she
is
growing
up
into
a
veritable
princess
winsome
often
as
she
sings
betty
closes
her
book
to
listen
thrilled
with
the
old
feeling
that
always
comes
with
the
music
of
the
harp
it
is
as
if
she
were
away
off
from
everything
and
high
up
where
it
is
wide
and
open
and
where
the
stars
are
the
strange
beautiful
thoughts
she
can
find
no
words
for
still
dance
on
ahead
like
shining
but
she
knows
that
she
shall
surely
find
words
for
them
some
day
and
that
many
besides
the
little
colonel
will
sing
her
verses
and
find
comfort
in
her
songs
to
both
betty
and
lloyd
the
land
of
someday
and
the
happy
land
of
now
lie
very
close
together
in
their
as
side
by
side
they
go
to
school
these
bright
october
mornings
or
stroll
slowly
homeward
in
the
golden
afternoons
under
the
shade
of
the
friendly
old
locusts
