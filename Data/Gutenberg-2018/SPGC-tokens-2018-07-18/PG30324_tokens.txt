sons
of
the
north
three
men
stood
ankle
deep
in
mud
on
the
shore
of
a
jungle
river
silently
watching
a
ribbon
of
smoke
drift
and
dissolve
above
the
somber
mass
of
trees
to
the
northwest
three
men
of
widely
different
types
they
were
yet
all
cradled
in
the
same
northern
land
the
tallest
lean
bodied
but
broad
shouldered
black
of
hair
and
gray
of
eye
held
himself
in
soldierly
fashion
and
gazed
unmoved
his
two
mates
one
stocky
red
faced
and
red
headed
the
other
slender
bronzed
and
blond
betrayed
their
thoughts
in
their
blue
eyes
the
red
man
squinted
quizzically
at
the
smoke
feather
as
if
it
mattered
little
to
him
where
he
was
the
blond
watched
it
with
the
wistfulness
of
one
who
sees
the
last
sign
of
his
own
world
fade
out
behind
them
at
a
respectful
distance
a
number
of
swarthy
individuals
of
both
sexes
in
nondescript
garments
smoked
and
stared
at
the
trio
with
the
interest
always
accorded
strangers
by
the
dwellers
of
the
out
places
they
eyed
the
uncompromising
back
of
the
tall
one
the
easy
lounge
of
the
red
one
the
thoughtful
attitude
of
the
light
one
the
men
peered
at
the
rifles
hanging
in
the
right
hands
of
the
newcomers
their
knee
boots
khaki
clothing
and
wide
hats
the
women
let
their
eyes
rove
over
the
boxes
and
bundles
reposing
in
the
mud
beside
the
three
hazarded
a
woman
speaking
through
the
stem
of
the
black
pipe
clutched
in
her
filed
teeth
asserted
a
man
nodding
toward
the
broad
hats
englishmen
would
wear
the
round
helmets
of
pith
traders
suggested
the
woman
hopefully
running
an
eye
again
over
the
bundles
the
man
corrected
explorers
of
the
bush
have
you
no
eyes
do
you
not
see
the
guns
and
high
boots
the
woman
subsided
the
others
continued
what
seemed
to
be
their
only
occupation
smoking
the
smoke
streamer
in
the
north
vanished
as
if
moved
by
the
same
impulse
the
three
strangers
turned
their
heads
and
looked
upriver
the
man
spoke
so
we
lit
at
last
as
the
feller
said
when
him
and
his
airyplane
landed
in
a
sewer
faith
i
dunno
but
he
was
better
off
than
us
at
that
he
was
two
thousand
miles
from
nowheres
like
we
are
the
steamer
gone
and
us
three
pore
boys
are
left
a
long
ways
from
home
then
assuming
the
tone
of
a
showman
he
went
on
before
ye
girls
ye
see
the
well
known
river
which
i
never
seen
before
and
comes
from
and
ends
in
the
ammyzon
over
there
on
side
the
water
is
peru
yer
feet
are
in
the
mud
of
brazil
this
other
river
to
yer
left
is
the
tickywahoo
tecuahy
the
blond
man
corrected
grinning
yeah
and
behind
ye
is
the
last
town
in
the
world
and
the
place
that
god
forgot
what
d
call
this
here
now
city
remate
de
males
which
means
of
evils
yeah
it
looks
it
wonder
if
it
anything
like
hell
kitchen
up
in
old
they
turned
and
looked
dubiously
at
the
town
a
row
of
perhaps
seventy
and
houses
set
on
high
poles
each
with
its
ladder
dropping
from
the
doorway
to
the
one
muddy
street
then
spoke
the
tall
man
before
you
see
it
again
tim
you
think
it
quite
a
town
above
here
is
nothing
but
a
few
rubber
estates
seven
hundred
miles
of
unknown
river
and
empty
jungle
empty
huh
then
they
kidded
us
on
the
boat
from
what
they
said
fair
crawlin
with
snakes
and
jaggers
and
lizards
and
bloody
vampires
and
spiders
as
big
as
yer
fist
and
the
water
is
full
o
fish
and
the
bush
full
o
injuns
if
that
what
ye
call
empty
cap
do
take
me
no
place
where
it
crowded
a
slight
smile
twitched
the
set
lips
of
the
tall
cap
they
all
here
tim
though
maybe
not
so
thick
as
you
expect
lots
of
other
things
too
who
this
through
the
knot
of
idlers
came
a
portly
coppery
man
in
uniform
well
i
be
say
he
the
same
chap
who
came
onto
the
boat
in
a
police
uniform
now
he
in
army
rig
the
member
of
the
trio
exclaimed
o
lordy
i
got
it
he
the
police
force
and
the
army
the
whole
blooming
works
ha
tim
snickered
and
stepped
forward
hullo
buddy
he
greeted
what
on
yer
mind
senhor
responded
the
official
affably
with
the
words
he
deftly
slipped
an
arm
around
tim
waist
and
lifted
the
other
hand
toward
his
shoulder
but
that
hand
stopped
short
then
flew
wildly
out
into
the
air
tim
gave
a
grunt
and
a
heave
the
official
went
skidding
and
slithering
six
feet
through
the
mud
clutching
at
nothing
and
contorting
himself
in
a
frantic
effort
to
keep
from
sprawling
in
the
muck
by
a
margin
thin
as
an
eyelash
he
succeeded
in
preserving
his
balance
and
stood
where
he
stopped
amazement
and
anger
in
his
face
lay
off
that
stuff
growled
tim
head
forward
and
jaw
out
if
ye
want
trouble
come
and
git
it
like
a
man
not
sneak
up
with
a
grin
and
then
clinch
do
reach
for
no
knife
now
or
i
drill
ye
tim
barked
the
one
automatically
tim
head
snapped
erect
and
his
shoulders
went
back
he
relaxed
again
almost
at
once
but
in
the
meantime
the
tall
man
had
stepped
forward
and
faced
the
raging
representative
of
the
government
of
brazil
pardon
comrade
he
said
with
an
engaging
smile
my
friend
is
a
stranger
to
brazil
and
not
acquainted
with
your
manner
of
welcome
in
our
own
country
men
never
put
the
arm
around
one
another
except
in
combat
he
has
been
a
soldier
you
are
a
soldier
so
you
can
understand
that
a
fighting
man
may
be
a
little
abrupt
when
he
does
not
understand
the
smile
the
apology
and
most
of
all
the
subtle
flattery
of
being
treated
as
an
equal
by
a
man
whose
manner
betokened
the
north
american
army
officer
mollified
the
aggrieved
official
at
once
the
hot
gleam
died
out
of
his
eyes
punctiliously
he
saluted
the
salute
was
as
punctiliously
returned
it
is
forgotten
capitao
as
the
capitao
says
we
soldiers
are
sometimes
overquick
i
come
to
give
you
welcome
to
remate
de
males
my
services
are
at
your
disposal
we
thank
you
why
do
you
call
me
capitao
my
eyes
know
a
capitao
when
they
see
him
but
this
is
not
a
military
expedition
my
friend
nor
are
any
of
us
soldiers
now
though
we
all
have
been
once
a
capitao
always
a
capitao
the
brazilian
insisted
then
he
hinted
if
the
capitao
and
his
friends
wish
to
call
upon
the
superintendente
they
will
find
him
in
the
intendencia
the
blue
building
beyond
the
hotel
it
will
soon
be
closed
for
the
day
the
tall
american
keen
gray
eyes
roved
down
the
street
to
the
house
whose
peeling
walls
once
might
have
been
blue
he
nodded
shortly
better
go
down
there
he
said
come
on
merry
tim
stick
here
and
keep
an
eye
on
the
stuff
and
do
start
another
war
while
we
gone

deftly
swung
his
rifle
to
his
right
shoulder

hey
there
buddy
would
ye
smoke
a
cigarette
if
i
give
ye
one
grinned
the
all
animosity
gone
and
as
the
other
two
men
tramped
away
through
the
mud
they
also
grinned
looking
back
at
the
north
and
the
south
american
pacing
side
by
side
in
blowing
smoke
and
conversing
like
brothers
in
arms
tim
likes
to
remember
his
orders
but

the

nope
the
is

while

he
of

again
as

mate
mimicking

chapter
ii
at
sundown
past
the
loungers
in
the
street
past
others
in
the
doorways
past
children
and
dogs
and
goats
the
pair
marched
briskly
to
the
faded
blue
house
whence
the
federal
superintendent
ruled
the
town
with
tropic
indolence
there
they
found
a
thin
gravely
courteous
gentleman
awaiting
them
sit
senhores
he
urged
with
a
languid
wave
of
the
hand
toward
chairs
i
am
honored
by
your
visit
as
is
all
remate
de
males
in
what
way
can
i
serve
you
the
blond
answered
we
have
come
sir
both
for
the
pleasure
of
making
your
acquaintance
and
for
a
little
information
first
permit
me
to
introduce
my
friend
roderick
mckay
lately
a
captain
in
the
united
states
army
i
am
meredith
knowlton
there
is
a
third
member
of
our
party
timothy
ryan
who
remained
on
the
river
bank
to
talk
with
er
a
soldier
of
brazil
the
federal
official
nodded
a
slight
smile
in
his
eyes
we
are
here
ostensibly
for
exploration
knowlton
continued
candidly
but
actually
to
find
a
certain
man
i
think
it
quite
probable
that
we
shall
have
to
do
considerable
exploring
before
finding
him
ah
the
other
murmured
shrewdly
it
is
a
matter
of
police
work
perhaps
no
and
yes
the
man
we
seek
is
not
wanted
by
the
law
and
yet
he
is
he
has
committed
no
crime
and
so
can
not
be
arrested
but
the
law
wants
him
badly
because
the
settlement
of
a
certain
big
estate
hinges
upon
the
question
of
whether
he
is
alive
or
dead
if
alive
he
is
heir
to
more
than
a
million
if
not
the
money
goes
elsewhere
ah
repeated
the
official
thoughtfully
i
might
add
mckay
broke
in
with
a
touch
of
stiffness
that
neither
i
nor
either
of
my
companions
would
profit
in
any
way
by
this
man
death
quite
the
contrary
ah
reiterated
the
other
his
face
clearing
you
are
commissioned
perhaps
to
find
and
produce
this
man
exactly
knowlton
nodded
from
our
own
financial
standpoint
he
is
worth
much
more
alive
than
dead
on
the
other
hand
any
absolute
proof
of
his
death
proof
which
would
stand
in
a
court
of
law
is
worth
something
also
our
task
is
to
produce
either
the
man
himself
or
indisputable
proof
that
he
no
longer
lives
the
man
name
is
david
dawson
rand
if
alive
he
now
is
years
old
height
five
feet
nine
weight
about
one
hundred
sixty
hair
dark
though
not
black
eyes
grayish
green
chief
distinguishing
marks
are
the
green
eyes
a
broken
nose
caused
by
being
struck
in
the
face
by
a
baseball
and
a
patch
of
hair
the
size
of
a
thumb
ball
two
inches
above
the
left
ear
accustomed
to
having
his
own
way
not
at
all
considerate
of
others
yet
not
a
bad
fellow
as
men
go
merely
a
man
spoiled
by
too
much
mothering
in
boyhood
and
by
the
fact
that
he
never
had
to
work
this
is
he
from
a
breast
pocket
he
drew
a
small
notebook
from
which
he
extracted
an
unmounted
photograph
the
superintendent
looked
into
the
pictured
face
of
a
man
with
a
slightly
blasé
expression
and
a
smile
after
studying
it
a
minute
he
nodded
and
handed
it
back
as
you
say
senhor
a
man
who
never
has
had
to
work
exactly
for
five
years
this
man
has
been
regarded
as
dead
it
was
his
habit
to
start
off
suddenly
for
any
place
where
his
whims
drew
him
notifying
nobody
of
his
departure
but
a
few
days
later
he
would
always
write
cable
or
telegraph
his
relatives
so
that
his
general
whereabouts
would
soon
become
known
on
his
last
trip
he
sent
a
radio
message
from
a
steamer
out
at
sea
saying
he
was
bound
for
rio
janeiro
that
was
the
last
ever
heard
from
him
rio
is
far
from
here
suggested
the
brazilian
just
so
we
look
for
rand
at
the
headwaters
of
the
amazon
instead
of
in
rio
because
rio
yields
no
clew
and
because
of
one
other
thing
which
i
shall
speak
of
presently
it
has
been
learned
that
he
reached
rio
safely
but
there
his
trail
ended
as
he
had
several
thousand
dollars
on
his
person
it
was
concluded
that
he
was
murdered
for
his
money
and
his
body
disposed
of
this
belief
has
been
held
until
quite
recently
when
a
new
book
of
travel
was
published
mother
of
by
dwight
dexter
an
explorer
of
considerable
reputation
the
brazilian
brows
lifted
senhor
dexter
i
remember
senhor
dexter
he
stopped
here
for
a
short
time
ill
with
fever
so
he
has
published
a
book
yes
it
deals
mainly
with
his
travels
and
observations
in
peru
along
the
marañon
huallaga
and
ucayali
but
it
includes
a
short
chapter
regarding
the
javary
and
in
that
chapter
occurs
the
following
which
i
have
copied
verbatim
from
the
notebook
he
read
falls
to
the
lot
of
the
explorer
at
times
to
meet
not
only
hitherto
unclassified
species
of
fauna
and
flora
but
also
strange
specimens
of
the
such
a
creature
came
suddenly
upon
my
camp
one
day
just
before
a
serious
and
fatal
attack
of
fever
compelled
me
to
relinquish
my
intention
to
proceed
farther
up
the
javary
my
indian
cook
was
preparing
the
afternoon
meal
out
from
the
dense
jungle
strode
a
bearded
painted
white
man
totally
nude
save
for
a
narrow
breechclout
and
a
quiver
containing
several
long
hunting
arrows
in
one
hand
he
carried
a
strong
bow
of
really
excellent
workmanship
this
was
his
only
weapon
he
wore
no
ornament
unless
streaks
of
brilliant
red
paint
be
considered
ornaments
he
was
wild
and
savage
in
appearance
and
manner
as
any
cannibal
indian
yet
he
was
indubitably
white
my
somewhat
startled
greeting
he
made
no
response
neither
did
he
speak
at
any
time
during
his
unceremonious
visit
bolt
upright
he
stood
beside
my
crude
table
until
the
indian
stolidly
brought
in
my
food
then
without
a
the
wild
man
rapidly
wolfed
down
the
entire
meal
feeding
himself
with
one
hand
and
holding
his
bow
ready
in
the
other
though
i
questioned
him
and
sought
to
draw
him
into
conversation
he
honored
me
with
not
so
much
as
a
grunt
or
a
gesture
when
the
table
was
bare
he
stalked
out
again
and
vanished
into
the
dim
forest
he
had
gone
my
indian
urged
that
we
leave
the
place
at
once
the
man
he
said
was
the
raposa
a
word
which
denotes
a
species
of
wild
dog
sometimes
found
on
the
upper
amazon
he
knew
nothing
of
this
raposa
except
that
he
apparently
belonged
to
a
wild
tribe
living
far
back
in
the
forest
perhaps
allied
with
the
cannibal
mayorunas
who
were
very
fierce
and
that
he
appeared
sometimes
at
indian
settlements
where
without
ever
speaking
he
would
help
himself
to
the
best
food
and
then
leave
my
man
seemed
to
fear
that
now
some
great
misfortune
would
come
to
us
unless
we
shifted
our
base
when
the
fever
came
upon
me
soon
afterward
the
superstitious
fellow
was
convinced
that
the
illness
was
attributable
directly
to
the
visit
of
the
human
wild
dog
from
the
nudity
and
barbarism
of
the
mysterious
stranger
certain
personal
peculiarities
struck
me
one
was
that
his
eyes
were
green
another
was
a
streak
of
hair
above
one
ear
furthermore
the
red
paint
on
his
body
outlined
his
skeleton
his
ribs
spine
and
all
were
portrayed
on
his
tanned
skin
by
those
brilliant
red
streaks
in
this
connection
my
indian
asserted
that
in
the
tribe
to
which
the
raposa
probably
belonged
it
was
the
custom
to
preserve
the
bones
of
the
dead
and
to
paint
them
with
this
same
red
dye
after
which
the
bones
were
hung
up
in
the
huts
of
the
deceased
instead
of
being
given
burial
beyond
this
my
informant
knew
nothing
of
the
red
bone
people
except
that
to
enter
their
country
was
death
knowlton
returned
the
book
to
his
pocket
and
carefully
buttoned
the
flap
when
that
appeared
he
continued
efforts
were
made
to
get
hold
of
dexter
with
the
idea
of
showing
him
the
photograph
of
the
missing
man
and
learning
any
additional
details
unfortunately
by
the
time
the
book
was
published
dexter
had
gone
to
africa
to
seek
a
race
of
dwarfs
said
to
exist
in
the
igidi
desert
and
thus
was
totally
out
of
reach
then
we
were
called
upon
to
follow
up
this
clew
and
find
the
raposa
if
possible
men
with
green
eyes
and
patches
of
white
hair
above
one
ear
are
not
common
so
though
our
knowledge
of
this
strange
wild
man
is
confined
to
those
few
words
of
dexter
we
are
here
to
learn
more
of
him
and
to
get
him
if
we
can
he
looked
expectantly
at
the
official
the
latter
after
staring
out
through
the
doorway
for
a
time
shook
his
head
slightly
something
of
this
raposa
and
of
those
people
has
come
to
my
ears
senhores
but
only
as
rumors
he
said
slowly
and
one
does
not
place
great
faith
in
rumors
yet
i
have
repeatedly
been
surprised
to
learn
after
dismissing
a
story
as
an
empty
indian
tale
that
the
tale
was
true
of
the
mayorunas
more
is
known
they
are
eaters
of
human
flesh
inhabiting
both
sides
of
the
javary
deadly
when
angered
and
very
easily
angered
their
country
is
not
many
days
distant
from
here
but
as
they
never
attack
us
we
do
not
attack
them
it
is
an
armed
neutrality
as
you
senhores
would
say
true
we
have
to
be
careful
in
drinking
water
for
they
sometimes
poison
the
streams
against
real
or
imaginary
enemies
and
the
poisoned
waters
flow
down
to
us
causing
those
who
drink
it
to
die
of
a
fever
like
the
typhoid
yet
and
he
smiled
there
is
a
saying
is
there
not
that
water
is
made
not
to
drink
but
to
bathe
in
knowlton
laughed
mckay
eyes
twinkled
i
sorry
to
say
that
water
about
all
a
fellow
can
get
to
drink
in
the
states
now
the
blond
man
said
ruefully
that
is
of
course
unless
a
man
knows
where
to
go
it
is
a
pity
but
here
in
brazil
one
need
not
drink
water
unless
he
wishes
and
often
it
is
better
not
to
of
the
mayorunas
senhor
you
do
not
intend
to
go
among
them
seeking
this
wild
man
of
the
red
bones
if
you
should
do
so
it
would
be
a
matter
of
regret
to
me
meaning
that
we
should
not
come
out
again
that
a
risk
we
have
to
face
we
go
wherever
it
is
necessary
i
am
sorry
i
regret
also
that
i
can
give
you
no
definite
information
yet
i
wish
you
all
success
senhores
and
a
safe
return
this
much
i
can
do
and
gladly
will
do
i
can
send
word
to
another
white
man
who
now
is
in
the
town
and
who
knows
much
of
the
upper
river
he
may
be
able
to
assist
you
and
without
doubt
will
be
eager
to
do
so
he
is
staying
at
the
hotel
just
below
here
senhor
schwandorf
the
eyes
of
the
two
americans
narrowed
the
official
coughed
senhor
mckay
has
been
a
soldier

senhor
knowlton
i
was
a

capitao
and
tenente
smiled
the
official
mckay
and
knowlton
strode
out
guess
this
is
the
hotel
hazarded
mckay
glancing
at
a
house
which
rose
slightly
above
the
others
i
go

and
have
somebody
rustle
our
impedimenta
up
here
he
turned
aside
knowlton
trudged
on
through
the
glare
of
sunset
to
the
river
bank
where
tim
and
the
army
of
remate
de

still
loafed
up
and
down
the
admired
of
all
beholders
all

lifted
up

and
much
to
the
edification
of
joey
whose

the

of

burst
into
song
mademoiselle

smoked
our
butts
and
bummed
our
beers
she
had
cockeyes
and
jackass
ears
and
she
had
been
kissed
for
forty
years
as
his
musical
effort
ended
out
from
the
dense
jungle
hemming
in
the
town
burst
a
hideous
roaring
howl
again
and
again
it
sounded
in
a
horrible
crash
of
noise
holy

gasped
tim
throwing
his
rifle
to

and
bracing
his
feet
now

chapter
iii
the
voice
of
the
wilds
mckay
eyes
twinkling
again
awaited
them
at
the
top
of
the
street
ladder
rooms
any
good
rod
hailed
knowlton
best
in
the
house
merry
see
any
insects
in
the
beds
nary
a
bug
in
the
beds
the
twinkle
grew
did
look
in
the
bureaus
or
behind
the
mirrors
come
look
over
entering
a
sizable
room
evidently
used
for
dining
for
its
chief
articles
of
furniture
were
two
tables
made
from
planed
palm
trunks
mckay
waved
a
hand
toward
a
row
of
four
doorways
on
the
right
first
three
are
ours
he
explained
only
vacancies
here
eight
rooms
in
this
hotel
the
other
four
over
there
he
pointed
across
the
room
on
the
other
side
of
which
opened
four
similar
doors
they
occupied
by
two
sick
men
one
drunk
hear
him
snore
and
one
which
is
kidding
huh
tim
snorted
suspiciously
i
think
ye
the
one
that
kiddin
cap
not
a
bit
i
looked
the
last
room
on
this
side
is
the
dutchman
and
these
are
ours
take
your
pick
they
all
alike
knowlton
stepped
to
the
nearest
and
looked
in
for
a
moment
he
said
no
word
then
he
softly
muttered
well
i
be
me
too
seconded
tim
who
had
been
craning
his
neck
the
room
was
absolutely
empty
no
bed
no
chair
no
bureau
no
rug
nothing
at
all
was
in
it
except
two
iron
hooks
its
floor
consisted
of
split
palm
logs
round
side
up
between
which
opened
spaces
its
walls
were
rusty
corrugated
iron
guiltless
of
mirrors
or
pictures
which
did
not
reach
to
the
roof
observe
the
excellent
ventilation
grinned
mckay
wind
blows
up
through
the
floor
if
there
is
any
wind
and
then
loops
over
the
partition
into
the
next
fellow
room
yeah
and
i
say
any
guy
that
drops
his
collar
button
is
out
o
luck
it
goes
plunk
into
the
mud
seven
foot
down
under
the
house
but
say
cap
how
the
heck
do
we
sleep
hang
ourselves
up
on
them
hooks
exactly
kind
o
rough
on
a
feller
shirt
ai
it
and
the
shirt
would
likely
pull
off
over
yer
head
before
mornin
yes
probably
would
but
the
secret
is
this
you
supposed
to
hang
your
hammock
on
those
hooks
you
provide
the
hammock
the
hotel
provides
the
hooks
what
more
can
you
ask
of
a
modern
hotel
huh
and
if
a
guy
wants
a
bath
there
the
river
all
full
o
and
cattawampuses
and
things
and
if
ye
eat
i
ye
rustle
yer
own
grub
and
pay
for
eatin
it
off
that
slab
table
there
there
jest
one
thing
ye
can
say
for
this
dump
a
feller
can
spit
on
the
floor
but
with
all
them
cracks
in
it
he
might
not
hit
it
at
that
mother
of
mine
to
think
missus
ryan
boy
should
ever
git
caught
stayin
in
a
hole
like
this
along
o
drunks
and
skiddin
and

no
peace
treaty

here
comes
the
baggage
train
with
our
stuff
in
here
men
puffing
and
grunting
antonio
and
jorge
and
rosario
and
meldo
shuffled
in
with
the
boxes
and
bundles
under
the
directions
of
mckay
and
knowlton
these
were
stowed
in
the
bare
rooms
then
the
four
shuffled
out
again
grinning
happily
over
a
small
roll
of
brazilian
paper
reis
which
mckay
had
peeled
from
a
much
larger
roll
and
handed
to
them
immediately
following
their
departure
in
came
a
youth
carrying
three
new
hammocks
our
beds
mckay
explained
i
sent
this
lad
to
a
trader
store
for
them
he
the
proprietor
son
thank
you
thomaz
tell
your
father
to
put
these
on
our
bill
and
take
for
yourself
this
small
token
of
our
appreciation
more
reis
changed
hands
the
young
brazilian
with
a
flash
of
teeth
informed
them
that
the
evening
meal
would
soon
be
ready
and
disappeared
through
a
rear
door
do
they
really
feed
us
at
this
here
now
hotel
tim
demanded
then
the
goat
safe
meaning
puzzled
knowlton
meanin
i
did
know
but
we
had
to
kill
our
supper
and
i
was
goin
to
git
the
goat
that
is
the
goat
the
kiddin
i
mean
the
goat

the
cap
the
skiddin
aw
rats
ye
know
what
i
drivin
at
me
tongue
so
dry
it
do
work
right
wherewith
tim
retreated
in
disorder
to
his
room
and
began
wrestling
with
his
new
hammock
and
the
iron
hooks
swift
darkness
filled
the
rooms
the
sun
had
slid
down
below
the
bulge
of
the
world
thomaz
lit
candles
stuck
in
empty
bottles
and
with
a
bow
placed
one
of
these
crude
illuminants
at
the
door
of
each
of
the
strangers
by
the
flickering
lights
mckay
and
knowlton
disposed
their
effects
according
to
their
individual
desires
bearing
in
mind
tim
observation
that
any
small
article
dropped
on
the
floor
would
land
in
the
mud
under
the
house
whence
sounded
the
grunts
of
pigs
their
work
was
soon
completed
and
they
sauntered
together
to
the
small
piazza
nice
quiet
little
place
commented
knowlton
make
a
good
sanitarium
for
nervous
folks
the
comment
was
made
in
a
tone
which
in
the
daytime
would
carry
half
a
mile
mckay
nodded
to
save
a
similar
effort
the
outbreak
of
the
howling
monkey
which
so
startled
tim
had
been
only
the
first
note
of
the
night
concert
of
the
jungle
now
that
the
sun
was
gone
the
chorus
was
in
full
swing
beasts
of
the
village
the
jungle
the
river
all
hurled
their
voices
into
the
uproar
from
the
gloom
around
the
houses
rose
the
bellowing
of
cows
and
calves
the
howls
and
yelps
of
dogs
the
yowling
of
cats
the
grunts
and
squeals
of
hogs
in
the
black
river
flowing
past
within
a
stone
throw
of
the
hotel
door
sounded
the
loud
snorts
of
dolphins
and
the
hideous
night
call
of
the
foul
beast
of
the
mud
the
alligator
out
from
the
matted
tangle
of
trees
and
brush
and
great
snakelike
vines
behind
the
town
rolled
the
appalling
roars
of
guaribas
raucous
bird
calls
dismal
hoots
sudden
scattered
screams
and
over
all
whelming
all
other
sound
by
the
sheer
might
of
its
penetrating
power
throbbed
the
hammering
of
millions
of
frogs
frogs
sound
like
a
barrage
the
blond
man
added
or
thousands
of
riveting
hammers
pounding
steel
queer
how
much
worse
it
is
when
you
right
in
it
we
heard
it
all
the
way
up
two
thousand
miles
of
amazon
but
but
you
right
beside
the
orchestra
now
position
is
everything
in
life
the
jest
made
knowlton
glance
sidelong
at
his
mate
of
the
tall
scot
past
he
knew
little
beyond
what
he
had
seen
of
him
in
war
where
he
had
met
him
and
learned
to
respect
him
from
occasional
remarks
he
had
learned
that
mckay
had
been
in
all
sorts
of
places
between
buenos
aires
and
nome
and
from
a
few
intangible
hints
he
suspected
that
his
position
in
life
had
once
been
much
higher
socially
than
at
present
but
he
asked
no
questions
some
orchestra
all
right
he
responded
casually
plenty
of
jazz
it
quiet
down
after
a
while
for
a
time
they
stood
leaning
against
the
wall
staring
abstractedly
out
at
the
dark
one
by
one
the
domestic
animals
ceased
their
clamor
and
settled
themselves
for
the
night
the
jungle
din
too
seemed
to
diminish
though
perhaps
this
was
because
the
ears
of
the
men
had
become
accustomed
to
it
at
length
through
the
discordant
symphony
boomed
the
voice
of
tim
by
cripes
i
know
now
what
folks
mean
when
they
talk
about
a
wilderness
always
thought
was
one
o
them
figgers
o
speech
but
tell
the
world
it
ai
no
joke
gosh
think
of
all
the
things
layin
out
there
and

and
waitin

pore
fellers
to
come
in
amongst
and
git
et
up

find
the
same
things
in
the
cities
up
home
said
knowlton
a
bit
cynically
different
bodies
and
different
methods
of
attack
but
the
same
merciless
animals
under
the
skin
snakes
in
silk
suits
alligators
in
dinner
jackets
and
vampires
painted
and
powdered
and
all
the
rest
of
it
yeah
ye
said
a
mouthful
looey
but
say
tommy
shovin
some
grub
on
the
table
mebbe
we
better
hop
to
it
before
the
flies
git
it
all
after
a
glance
at
the
vicious
attack
already
begun
by
the
aforesaid
flies
the
pair
adopted
tim
suggestion
and
hopped
to
it
manfully
they
assailed
the
rubbery
jerked
beef
black
beans
rice
farinha
and
thick
black
unsweetened
coffee
which
comprised
the
meal
all
three
were
wrestling
with
chunks
of
the
meat
when
tim
facing
the
door
stopped
chewing
long
enough
to
mutter
dutchland
overalls
here
the
goose
stepper
the
heads
of
the
other
two
involuntarily
moved
a
little
then
their
necks
stiffened
and
they
continued
eating
tim
alone
stared
straight
at
a
burly
teuton
who
had
halted
in
the
outer
doorway
and
tim
alone
saw
the
ugly
look
crossing
the
newcomer
visage
as
he
gazed
at
the
khaki
shirts
the
broad
shoulders
under
them
and
the
unmistakably
irish
and
hostile
face
of
tim
himself
catching
the
hard
stare
of
the
man
he
of
the
black
beard
advanced
at
once
his
eyes
veering
to
the
door
of
his
own
room
straight
to
that
room
he
marched
with
heavy
tread
he
opened
the
door
with
a
kick
shut
it
behind
him
with
a
slam
the
three
at
the
table
glanced
at
one
another
say
what
ye
like
grumbled
tim
but
me
and
that
guy
do
hold
no
mush
party
i
do
like
his
map
i
do
like
his
manners
and
he
looks
too
much
like
the
fritz
that
shot
me
in
the
back
with
a
kamerad
gun
after
surrenderin
i
was
in
hospital
three
months
d
mind

time
looey
knowlton
nodded
he
remembered
also
that
tim
shot
down
from
behind
and
almost
killed
had
reeled
up
to
his
feet
and
bayoneted
his
man
before
falling
the
second
time
wherefore
he
replied
he
is
the
same
one
tim
nope
grimly
that
one
wo
never
come
back
all
the
same
if

wherewith
he
demolished
the
rest
of
his
meal
with
military
dispatch
proceeded
doorward
smote
the
grinning
army
of
remate
de
males
a
buffet
on
the
shoulder
and
vanished
into
the
night
a
moment
later
his
stentorian
voice
rolled
back
through
the
nocturnal
racket
in
an
impromptu
paraphrase
of
an
old
and
highly
improper
army
song
we
in
the
jungle

behind

the
door
of
the
german
room
opened
the
german
came
out
and
marched
to
the
table
two
paces
away
he
halted
and
faced
the
americans
ready
to
speak
if
spoken
to
equally
ready
to
sit
and
ignore
them
if
not
greeted
mckay
and
knowlton
rose
herr
von
schwandorf
inquired
knowlton
schwandorf
neither
herr
nor
von
plain
schwandorf
the
reply
came
in
excellent
english
though
with
a
slight
throaty
accent
knowlton
is
my
name
mckay
the
third
member
of
our
party
ryan
has
just
left
schwandorf
bowed
stiffly
from
the
waist
it
is
a
pleasure
to
meet
you
white
men
are
all
too
few
here
seating
himself
at
a
place
beyond
that
just
vacated
by
tim
he
continued
you
stay
here
for
a
time
not
long
they
reseated
themselves
we
go
up
the
river
as
soon
as
we
can
arrange
transportation
the
black
brows
lifted
slightly
it
is
a
dangerous
river
you
would
do
well
to
travel
elsewhere
unless
you
have
some
pressing
reason
to
explore
this
stream
with
an
accustomed
sweep
of
the
hand
he
shooed
the
flies
from
the
bean
dish
and
helped
himself
to
a
big
portion
over
the
legumes
he
poured
farinha
in
the
brazilian
fashion
we
have
we
are
seeking
a
tribe
of
people
who
paint
their
bones
red
schwandorf
hand
conveying
the
first
mouthful
of
beans
upward
stopped
in
air
his
black
eyes
fixed
the
americans
with
an
astounded
stare
he
lowered
the
beans
stabbed
absently
at
a
chunk
of
beef
sawed
it
apart
popped
a
piece
of
it
into
his
mouth
and
sat
for
a
time
chewing
when
the
meat
was
down
he
spoke
bluntly
are
there
not
ways
enough
to
kill
yourselves
at
home
instead
of
traveling
to
this
place
to
do
it
mckay
smiled
the
directness
of
the
man
amused
him
as
bad
as
that
asked
knowlton
as
bad
as
that
blow
your
head
off
if
you
like
cut
your
throat
take
poison
jump
into
the
river
among
the
alligators
step
on
a
snake
but
keep
away
from
the
red
bones
why
shot
mckay
cannibals
and
worse
worse
truly
most
of
the
brazilian
savages
do
not
torture
the
red
bones
do
pleasant
prospect
very
nothing
to
be
gained
among
them
either
if
you
hunting
gold
try
the
hills
over
west
of
the
huallaga
none
here
knowlton
filled
and
lit
a
pipe
mckay
slowly
drank
the
last
of
his
syrupy
coffee
and
rolled
a
cigarette
schwandorf
continued
shoveling
food
into
his
capacious
mouth
know
anything
about
the
raposa
knowlton
asked
the
teuton
eyelashes
flickered
he
ground
another
chunk
of
meat
between
his
jaws
before
answering
of
course
he
said
then
wild
dog
sharp
snout
gray
hair
bushy
tail
i
shot
a
couple
of
them
this
one
is
a
man
green
eyes
streak
of
white
hair
over
the
left
ear
paints
himself
like
the
red
bones
as
you
call
them
but
is
a
white
man
oh
that
one
heard
of
him
yes
wild
man
of
the
jungle
want
to
catch
him
and
put
him
in
a
circus
maybe
we
like
to
see
him
anyhow
heard
about
him
awhile
ago
any
way
to
get
him
that
you
know
of
might
try
a
steel
trap
the
german
suggested
callously
but
i
know
where
you
set
it
best
way
to
get
a
wild
dog
is
to
shoot
him
and
he
is
much
good
dead
or
would
this
one
be
worth
something
dead
a
swift
sidelong
glance
accompanied
the
question
not
a
cent
snapped
mckay
and
perhaps
he
be
worth
nothing
alive
added
knowlton
but
we
have
a
healthy
curiosity
to
look
him
over
guess
the
red
bone
country
would
be
the
likeliest
place
how
far
is
it
from
here
keep
out
of
it
was
the
stubborn
reply
the
americans
rose
we
are
not
going
to
keep
out
of
it
knowlton
declared
coldly
we
are
going
straight
into
it
thank
you
for
your
assistance
not
so
fast
schwandorf
protested
if
you
are
determined
to
go
i
will
help
you
if
i
can
shall
we
sit
on
the
piazza
with
a
small
bottle
to
aid
digestion
so
thomaz
bring
from
my
stock
the
kümmel
or
would
you
prefer
whisky
gentlemen
highballs
are
my
favorite
fruit
admitted
knowlton
can
ginger
ale
be
bought
here
indeed
yes
at
one
milrei
a
bottle
cheap
enough
thomaz
three
bottles
of
ginger
ale
and
one
of
north
american
whisky
the
best
cigars
also
out
on
the
piazza
si
senhores
schwandorf
got
up
if
you
will
pardon
me
i
will
drink
my
kümmel
frankly
i
do
not
like
whisky
and
frankly
we
do
not
like
kümmel
all
a
matter
of
taste
truly
so
let
each
of
us
drink
his
own
preference
i
will
join
you
in
a
moment
the
americans
sauntered
to
the
door
while
the
german
strode
into
his
room
blunt
sort
of
cuss
knowlton
commented
ay
blunt
but
not
candid
knows
more
than
he
telling
disposing
themselves
comfortably
they
sat
watching
the
lights
of
the
town
and
the
jungle
the
first
pouring
from
windows
and
open
doors
the
latter
streaking
across
the
darkness
where
the
big
fire
beetles
of
the
tropics
winged
their
way
as
knowlton
had
predicted
the
night
noise
of
forest
and
stream
had
diminished
but
now
from
the
village
itself
rose
a
new
discord
a
babel
of
vocal
and
instrumental
efforts
at
music
emanating
from
the
badly
worn
records
of
dozens
of
cheap
phonographs
grinding
away
in
the
huts
good
lord
groaned
mckay
even
here
at
the
end
of
the
world
one
get
away
from
those
beastly
instruments
a
throaty
chuckle
from
the
doorway
followed
the
words
schwandorf
emerged
carrying
a
big
bottle
yet
there
is
one
thing
to
be
thankful
for
gentlemen
he
said
in
all
this
town
there
is
not
one
man
who
attempts
to
play
a
trombone
the
others
laughed
thomaz
appeared
with
bottles
and
thick
cups
corks
were
drawn
liquids
gurgled
matches
flared
cigars
glowed
without
warning
schwandorf
shot
a
question
through
the
gloom
have
you
seen
cabral
the
superintendent
yes
ask
him
about
the
wild
man
yes
get
any
information
nothing
definite
he
suggested
that
we
see
you
so
a
pause
while
schwandorf
cigar
end
glowed
like
a
flaming
eye
the
red
bones
live
well
up
the
river
he
began
abruptly
days
by
canoe
five
days
through
the
bush
on
the
east
shore
that
would
bring
you
to
their
main
settlement
if
you
were
not
wiped
out
before
then
they
a
big
tribe
as
tribes
go
ever
been
here
before
no
not
here
knowlton
told
him
i
been
in
rio
and
mckay
here
has
knocked
around
in
a
stealthy
kick
from
mckay
halted
him
an
instant
then
deftly
shifting
the
sentence
he
concluded
in
a
number
of
places
so
another
pause
then
i
should
explain
about
tribes
tribes
here
generally
consist
of
from
fifty
to
five
hundred
or
more
persons
living
in
big
houses
called
unless
the
tribe
is
very
big
one
house
holds
them
all
there
may
be
any
number
of
the
inhabitants
of
which
are
all
of
the
same
racial
stock
yet
each
is
as
far
as
government
is
concerned
a
tribe
to
itself
controlled
by
a
chief
no
owes
any
duty
to
any
other
there
is
no
supreme
ruler
over
all
nor
even
a
federation
among
them
they
live
merely
as
neighbors
distant
neighbors
at
times
they
fight
like
neighbors
you
understand
greek
meets
greek
quoted
mckay
just
so
when
i
say
then
that
the
red
bones
are
a
big
tribe
i
mean
that
there
are
about
five
hundred
maybe
more
individuals
in
their
main
settlement
they
live
in
huts
not
in
one
big
like
the
mayorunas
they
are
not
mayorunas
in
fact
they
paint
differently
are
darker
of
skin
and
more
cruel
the
mayorunas
by
the
way
are
not
so
debased
as
you
might
think
though
cannibals
they
do
not
kill
for
the
sake
of
eating
pig
like
the
cannibals
of
the
south
seas
neither
do
they
eat
the
whole
body
only
the
hands
and
feet
of
their
dead
enemies
are
devoured
these
are
carefully
cooked
and
eaten
as
delicacies
along
with
monkey
meat
birds
fish
and
other
things
prepared
for
a
feast
in
honor
of
a
victory
the
eating
of
human
flesh
seems
to
be
symbolism
rather
than
savagery
furthermore
they
do
not
range
the
jungle
hunting
for
victims
they
eat
only
those
who
come
against
them
as
enemies
so
it
is
quite
possible
you
see
that
strangers
might
go
among
them
and
escape
death
it
would
depend
largely
on
the
ability
of
the
strangers
to
convince
the
savages
that
they
were
friends
the
difficulty
is
that
the
savages
consider
all
strangers
to
be
enemies
until
friendship
is
proved
a
sizable
difficulty
mckay
remarked
almost
insurmountable
yet
it
might
be
done
mind
i
speak
now
of
the
mayorunas
not
of
the
red
bones
i
tell
you
again
that
the
red
bone
country
is
closed
and
where
is
the
mayoruna
region
in
the
same
general
section
the
mayorunas
are
much
more
widely
distributed
they
are
on
both
banks
of
the
javary
and
extend
as
far
west
as
the
ucayali
now
if
i
sought
to
enter
the
red
bone
region
and
again
i
say
i
would
not
this
would
be
my
way
of
going
at
it
i
would
go
first
among
the
mayorunas
near
the
red
bones
and
seek
to
convince
them
that
i
was
their
friend
i
would
make
the
mayoruna
chief
as
friendly
to
me
as
possible
i
might
even
take
a
mayoruna
woman
for
a
time
some
of
them
are
handsome
and
such
a
step
would
make
me
almost
a
mayoruna
myself
in
their
eyes
then
i
would
persuade
the
chief
to
send
messengers
to
the
red
bones
with
word
of
me
and
a
request
that
i
be
allowed
to
visit
their
settlement
the
request
coming
from
the
mayoruna
chief
probably
would
be
granted
i
would
then
go
in
with
a
bodyguard
of
mayorunas
do
my
business
and
come
out
via
the
mayoruna
route
a
thoughtful
silence
ensued
bottle
necks
clinked
against
the
cups
something
in
that
idea
conceded
knowlton
a
good
deal
in
it
barring
the
woman
part
of
course
ay
spoke
mckay
his
tone
casual
as
ever
when
you
came
out
what
would
you
do
with
your
woman
schwandorf
tongue
loosened
a
bit
by
his
kümmel
chuckled
the
woman
leave
her
of
course
when
she
had
served
my
purpose
why
bother
about
a
woman
here
and
there
i
see
mckay
face
indistinct
in
the
gloom
was
unreadable
but
his
tone
had
a
caustic
edge
schwandorf
laughed
again
you
are
fresh
from
the
united
states
and
you
disapprove
but
this
is
the
jungle
and
all
is
different
terra
com
seu
as
these
brazilians
say
each
land
with
its
own
ways
perhaps
when
you
have
met
the
mayoruna
women
looked
on
their
handsome
faces
and
shapely
forms
they
wear
no
clothing
by
the
way
you
will
change
your
ideas
more
than
one
man
along
this
border
has
risked
his
life
to
win
one
of
those
women
but
that
rests
with
you
and
now
if
you
will
excuse
me
gentlemen
i
have
an
engagement
with
a
man
at
the
other
end
of
town
certainly
we
are
indebted
to
you
for
your
interest
it
is
nothing
remember
that
i
strongly
advise
you
not
to
go
but
if
you
will
go
i
shall
gladly
do
whatever
lies
in
my
power
to
aid
you
in
preparing
for
the
trip
do
not
hesitate
to
call
on
me
he
passed
into
the
house
returning
almost
at
once
by
the
way
he
added
one
of
you
has
the
room
next
mine
i
have
it
said
knowlton
yes
are
you
a
good
sleeper
i
sometimes
snore
most
atrociously
i
am
told
so
perhaps
do
worry
i
can
sleep
in
the
middle
of
a
bombardment
you
are
fortunate
good
evening
gentlemen
when
he
was
gone
they
sat
for
a
time
smoking
sipping
now
and
then
at
their
highballs
at
length
mckay
said
humph
amen
pretty
square
sort
of
chap
though
do
you
think
i
not
saying
was
the
scot
cautious
answer
seems
to
be
trying
to
discourage
us
and
egg
us
on
at
the
same
time
something
up
his
sleeve
perhaps
ca
tell
but
his
line
of
talk
rings
true
so
far
checks
up
all
right
with
what
we
heard
about
the
mayorunas
and
so
on
and
that
scheme
of
working
in
through
the
mayoruna
country
sounds
about
as
sensible
as
anything
desperate
chance
and
all
that
but
it
might
work
say
why
did
you
kick
me
when
i
was
going
to
tell
him
you
been
in
british
guiana
do
know
exactly
had
a
hunch
seems
to
me
i
seen
that
fellow
before
somewhere
but
i
ca
place
him
none
of
his
business
where
been
anyhow
we
boobs
from
the
states
hunting
for
a
wild
man
all
he
needs
to
know
but
it
was
not
enough
for
schwandorf
to
know
at
that
very
moment
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
home
of
superintendent
cabral
with
whom
he
had
no
engagement
whatever
to
learn
all
he
could
concerning
the
business
of
these
strangers
also
to
impress
on
that
official
the
fact
that
he
had
sought
to
dissuade
them
from
starting
on
their
mad
quest
and
much
later
that
night
when
knowlton
was
making
good
his
boast
that
he
was
a
sound
sleeper
a
face
rose
silently
above
the
iron
partition
between
his
room
and
that
of
the
german
a
hand
gripping
a
small
electric
flashlight
followed
a
white
ray
searched
the
room
halting
on
the
khaki
shirt
lying
over
a
box
a
tough
withe
with
a
barb
at
one
end
came
over
like
a
slender
tentacle
hooked
the
shirt
neatly
drew
it
stealthily
up
to
the
top
shirt
stick
lamp
hand
face
all
dissolved
into
darkness
after
a
time
they
reappeared
the
shirt
came
down
swung
slowly
back
and
forth
was
dropped
deftly
where
it
had
previously
lain
the
breast
pocket
holding
the
notebook
and
the
photograph
of
david
dawson
rand
was
buttoned
as
it
had
been
and
the
notebook
bulged
the
cloth
slightly
as
before
but
the
contents
of
that
book
and
the
pictured
face
of
rand
now
were
stamped
on
the
brain
of
schwandorf
a
sneering
snarling
smile
curled
the
heavy
mouth
of
schwandorf
and
softly
so
softly
that
none
could
hear
it
but
himself
sounded
the
ironical
benediction
of
schwandorf
sleep
well
dream
on
poor
fool
in
time
you
will
wake
up
you
will
wake
up
chapter
into
the
bush
sleepy
eyed
and
frowzy
haired
with
shirt
unbuttoned
and
breeches
and
boots
unlaced
tim
emerged
from
his
cell
into
the
main
room
blinked
at
mckay
and
knowlton
lounging
over
their
morning
coffee
and
cigarettes
stretched
his
hairy
arms
and
advanced
sluggishly
to
the
table
he
yawned
ai
they
cute
all
dressed
and
shaved
like
they
was
goin
to
visit
the
o
and
here
pore
timmy
ryan
like
a
and
dirty
jest
throwed
into
the
guardhouse
and
worse
top
o
the
mornin
to
ye
gents
same
to
you
tim
mckay
nodded
who
hit
you
asked
knowlton
squinting
at
bumps
and
scratches
on
forehead
nobody
couple
fellers
tried
to
but
they
was
out
o
luck
oh
i
see
what
ye
mean
i
done
that
meself
while
i
was
gittin
to
bed
waves
must
have
been
running
high
on
the
ocean
last
night
better
drink
some
coffee
thomaz
another
cup
big
and
black
thanks
looey
was
kind
of
an
active
night
at
that
i
heard
you
come
in
vouchsafed
mckay
were
you
trying
some
high
diving
in
your
room
faith
i
done
some
divin
without
tryin
but
was
ragged
work
i
pulled
a
belly
smacker
every
time
i
got
to
tame
that
hammick
o
mine
it
throwed
me
four
times
and
the
only
way
i
could
hold
it
down
was
to
unhook
it
and
lay
it
on
the
floor
sleep
well
then
i
did
not
cap
i
thought
i
knowed
somethin
about
cooties
but
i
take
it
back
i
never
knowed
nothin
about
them
insecks
till
last
night
where
they
come
from
i
dunno
but
i
tell
the
world
they
come
and
if
they
was
half
an
inch
long
i
eat
they
darn
near
dragged
me
off
whole
and
all
the
sleep
i
got
ye
could
stick
in
a
flea
eye
lookit
here
he
extended
an
arm
dotted
with
swollen
red
spots
ants
said
mckay
after
one
glance
ants
not
cooties
everywhere
especially
under
the
floor
that
one
reason
why
folks
sleep
in
hammocks
down
here
even
then
they
likely
to
come
down
the
hammock
cords
and
drive
you
out
ants
hey
never
thought
o
that
and
i
sooner
spend
another
night
fightin
all
the
jaggers
in
the
jungle
than
them
bugs
the
little
things
that
count
as
the
feller
said
when
his
wife
give
him
his
fourteenth
baby
he
downed
the
thick
coffee
brought
by
thomaz
demanded
another
cup
accepted
cigarette
and
light
from
knowlton
and
sighed
heavily
who
tried
to
hit
you
knowlton
persisted
aw
i
dunno
fellers
took
swipes
at
me
with
bottles
and
things
me
and
joey
went
to
a
place
where
they
card
games
and
so
on
only
place
in
town
where
the
village
sports
can
git
action
joey
offers
to
buy
and
does
stuff
tastes
kind
o
moldy
to
me
so
i
asks
have
they
got
any
american
beer
they
have
it
bottled
and
warm
but
it
beer
and
tastes
like
home
it
goes
down
so
slick
i
buy
another
round
and
then
one
more
lettin
in
a
stranger
on
the
third
round
that
makes
seven
bottles
altogether
then
i
think
mebbe
i
better
pay
up
now
before
i
lose
track
looey
guess
what
them
seven
bottles
o
suds
come
to
in
american
money
well
say
about
three
and
a
half
or
four
dollars
that
what
i
figgered
mourned
tim
but
them
highbinders
want
dollars
and
twenty
cents
american
gold
what
sad
but
true
seems
the
stuff
sells
here
for
four
bucks
and
sixty
cents
a
bottle
thinkin
i
gittin
rooked
because
i
a
tenderfoot
i
raise
a
row
to
oncet
and
start
to
climb
the
guy
other
folks
mix
in
and
things
git
lively
right
off
but
after
i
dropped
a
couple
o
fellers
joey
winds
himself
round
me
and
begs
me
not
to
make
him
arrest
me
and
also
tells
me
i
all
wrong
that
the
regular
price
so
that
makes
me
out
a
cheap
skate
unless
i
come
acrost
and
i
do
the
right
thing
lucky
you
had
the
money
on
you
said
mckay
eying
him
a
bit
oddly
i
did
chuckled
tim
all
the
dough
i
had
was
one
pore
lonesome
the
one
i
got
from
ye
yesterday
cap
but
i
do
tell
that
i
jest
wave
my
hand
like
plunks
was
nothin
in
my
young
life
and
start
to
work
meself
out
o
the
hole
after
the
two
guys
on
the
floor
are
brought
back
to
their
senses
i
order
up
drinks
for
all
hands
and
git
popular
again
then
i
git
out
the
bones
oh
i
see
mckay
laughed
silently
sure
remember
they
told
us
on
the
boat
that
these
guys
will
gamble
on
anything
and
that
a
feller
without
shoes
on
may
be
some
rubber
worker
packin
a
roll
that
would
choke
a
horse
wal
i
make
a
few
passes
with
them
dice
o
mine
and
their
eyes
light
up
like
somebody
had
switched
on
the
current
then
i
scrabble
me
hand
around
in
me
pants
pocket
like
i
was
peelin
a
bill
off
a
roll
so
big
i
did
want
to
flash
the
whole
wad
and
haul
out
that
pore
ten
and
ask
would
anybody
like
to
play
a
man
game
they
would
i
say
they
would
and
they
got
the
coin
to
back
up
their
play
too
before
i
come
home
i
was
buyin
beer
by
the
case
instead
the
bottle
and
it
all
paid
for
and
i
got
more
a
hundred
dollars
left
besides
givin
joey
a
fistful
o
money
jest
for
bein
a
good
feller
this
ai
a
bad
town
at
all
gents
outside
o
that
hammick
and
the
ants
i
had
a
lovely
evenin
how
about
joao
lady
friend
quizzed
knowlton
huh
oh
i
did
git
to
see
her
when
bones
and
beer
are
rollin
high
and
handsome
i
got
no
time
for
women
besides
i
found
out
she
was
mostly
injun
and
fat
as
a
hog
nothin
like
that
for
timmy
ryan
oh
say
before
i
forgit
it
i
asked
joey
about
this
dutchman
here
and
he
says
mckay
scowled
shook
his
head
pointed
toward
the
closed
door
of
schwandorf
tim
lifted
his
brows
winked
understanding
and
went
on
with
a
break
that
this
guy
is
a
feller
and
knows
this
river
like
a
book
says
he
one
fine
guy
and
a
man
from
hair
to
heels
following
which
he
grimaced
as
if
something
smelled
bad
adding
in
a
barely
audible
whisper
and
that
the
worst
lie
i
ever
told
we
met
schwandorf
last
night
after
you
went
knowlton
said
easily
drawing
down
one
eyelid
very
likable
sort
of
chap
he
going
to
help
us
get
started
upriver
when
do
we
go
if
possible
glad
of
it
this
sportin
life
would
be
the
ruination
of
a
simple
country
kid
like
me
wonder
how
all
our
neighbors
are
this
mornin
the
goat
and
the
drunk
and
the
two
sick
fellers
kind
quiet
over
that
side
o
the
room
thomaz
entered
just
then
with
more
coffee
knowlton
turned
to
him
are
the
sick
men
better
thomaz
much
better
senhor
the
lad
said
carelessly
they
are
dead
huh
tim
grunted
explosively
dead
the
youth
repeated
they
were
taken
out
at
dawn
do
not
be
alarmed
it
was
the
swamp
fever
which
is
not
what
you
say
catching
humph
sort
of
a
thing
to
die
of
fever
here
hey
thomaz
shrugged
as
if
hearing
a
foolish
question
swamp
fever
yellow
fever
smallpox
beriberi
we
live
we
are
dead
true
for
ye
they
allays
somethin
hidin
round
the
corner
waitin
to
jump
ye
no
matter
where
ye
are
if
one
thing
it
another
despite
his
philosophical
answer
however
tim
fell
silent
his
eyes
going
to
the
doors
of
the
rooms
where
death
had
stalked
last
night
while
he
was
gambling
like
most
men
in
whose
veins
red
blood
runs
bold
and
free
he
had
no
fear
of
the
sort
of
death
befitting
a
fighter
sudden
and
violent
but
a
deep
repugnance
for
those
two
assassins
against
which
a
victim
could
not
fight
back
disease
and
poison
the
brazilian
nonchalant
fatalism
aroused
him
to
the
fact
that
here
both
those
forms
of
death
were
very
near
him
the
one
in
the
air
the
other
on
the
ground
fever
and
snakes
for
the
moment
he
was
depressed
then
curiosity
awoke
if
this
here
now
javary
fever
ai
catchin
how
does
a
feller
git
it
mosquitoes
mckay
enlightened
him
the
it
bites
a
man
who
has
fever
then
bites
a
well
man
and
leaves
the
fever
in
him
inside
of
ten
days
he
sick
unless
he
takes
a
huge
dose
of
quinine
right
away
mosquito
attacks
perpendicular
to
the
skin
that
is
it
stands
on
its
head
if
you
ever
notice
one
of
them
biting
that
way
get
busy
with
the
quinine
huh
fat
chance
a
feller
got
o
seein
just
how
all
these
bugs
bite
him
and
one
muskeeter
standin
on
its
head
does
all
that
hey
so
they
say
also
they
say
it
only
the
female
that
bites
yeah
i
believe
it
i
been
stung
more
once
by
females
before
now
how
about
the
yeller
fever
git
that
the
same
way
same
way
only
a
different
mosquito
the
when
you
begin
to
vomit
black
you
gone
and
if
you
get
beriberi
you
gone
too
first
symptoms
of
that
are
numbness
of
the
fingers
and
toes
muscular
paralysis
goes
on
until
your
heart
stops
nice
cheerful
place
to
die
in
this
ammyzon
jungle
aw
well
what
the
odds
wherewith
he
inhaled
more
coffee
flipped
his
cigarette
butt
at
a
small
lizard
on
the
floor
not
far
away
yawned
once
more
and
swaggered
out
to
the
piazza
bawling
and
when
i
die
do
bury
me
but
pickle
me
bones
in
when
his
roar
had
subsided
and
the
two
former
officers
had
sat
silent
a
moment
smiling
over
his
nocturnal
adventures
the
door
of
room
opened
abruptly
and
the
german
stepped
out
he
grunted
striding
to
the
table
thomaz
senhor
sssondoff
the
youth
faded
away
into
the
kitchen
quarters
always
feel
grumpy
until
i
eat
grumbled
the
blackbeard
none
of
this
breakfast
for
me
a
real
meal
coffee
with
gin
in
it
a
cigar
then
i
feel
human
sleep
well
his
bold
gaze
never
flickered
as
it
encountered
knowlton
fine
if
you
snored
i
did
know
it
did
hear
the
bodies
taken
out
this
morning
either
bodies
oh
those
fellows
dead
he
tilted
his
head
toward
the
doors
behind
which
the
sick
men
had
lain
glad
of
it
best
for
them
and
everybody
else
hate
to
have
sick
people
in
the
place
the
americans
said
nothing
they
lit
new
cigarettes
and
waited
for
the
other
to
become
human
and
when
his
substantial
breakfast
was
down
his
coffee
had
disappeared
and
his
big
cigar
was
aglow
he
did
well
gentlemen
have
you
decided
to
take
good
advice
and
let
your
raposa
alone
he
asked
affably
who
ever
follows
good
advice
knowlton
countered
schwandorf
chuckled
nobody
so
you
will
go
he
shook
his
head
solemnly
i
have
said
all
i
can
without
offense
but
if
you
persist
i
can
only
help
you
to
start
if
possible
i
should
like
to
go
with
you
up
the
river
to
the
place
where
you
will
take
to
the
bush
but
i
must
go
to
iquitos
in
peru
on
the
monthly
launch
which
is
due
in
a
day
or
two
so
all
my
business
is
in
the
other
direction
if
now
i
can
aid
in
the
matter
of
a
crew
that
is
what
we
were
about
to
ask
of
you
so
then
let
us
be
about
it
i
have
been
thinking
since
you
showed
your
determination
last
night
and
have
made
inquiries
about
men
there
are
now
in
nazareth
the
little
peruvian
town
across
the
river
several
men
from
whom
you
can
pick
an
excellent
crew
men
of
the
river
and
the
bush
not
worthless
loafers
like
these
townsmen
here
men
who
are
not
afraid
of
hell
or
high
water
as
the
saying
is
not
remarkable
for
either
beauty
or
brains
but
good
men
for
your
work
by
far
the
best
you
can
obtain
i
would
suggest
a
large
canoe
and
six
or
eight
of
those
men
as
crew
the
others
smoked
thoughtfully
then
mckay
said
we
should
prefer
brazilians
not
if
you
knew
the
people
hereabouts
as
well
as
i
it
of
course
makes
no
personal
difference
to
me
what
sort
of
crew
you
get
but
i
tell
you
that
these
men
are
best
what
does
it
matter
which
side
of
the
river
they
come
from
men
are
men
true
mckay
conceded
ca
be
too
fussy
here
knowlton
added
let
see
the
men
all
rose
but
then
schwandorf
suggested
no
need
of
your
going
to
nazareth
better
stay
here
unless
you
want
to
go
through
a
great
deal
of
ceremonious
foolishness
over
there
peruvian
ground
and
the
barefooted
ignoramuses
of
officials
may
insist
on
showing
their
importance
by
demanding
your
papers
and
all
that
i
can
go
across
get
the
men
and
be
back
here
before
you
be
half
through
the
preliminaries
saves
time
all
right
if
it
not
too
much
trouble
a
good
deal
less
trouble
than
if
you
went
to
be
frank
i
known
and
i
can
go
straight
about
the
business
so
sit
down
and
wait
thomaz
my
hat
out
he
tramped
to
the
piazza
where
he
paused
a
moment
to
run
a
swift
eye
over
the
disheveled
figure
of
tim
who
had
fallen
sound
asleep
in
a
chair
then
without
a
further
word
or
glance
he
descended
the
ladder
and
swung
away
down
the
street
the
americans
watching
him
from
the
doorway
observed
that
children
in
his
path
hastened
to
get
out
of
it
and
that
he
spoke
to
nobody
prussian
rasped
mckay
done
time
in
the
kaiser
army
too
even
if
he
has
been
here
since
before
the
war
but
he
treating
us
pretty
white
the
captain
made
no
answer
their
eyes
followed
the
big
figure
until
they
saw
it
go
sliding
away
toward
peru
in
a
canoe
propelled
by
two
languid
townsmen
then
mckay
dropped
a
hand
on
tim
shoulder
the
eyes
flew
open
instantly
briefly
quietly
knowlton
told
of
what
had
passed
while
he
napped
then
asked
what
information
he
had
gleaned
from
joao

says
answered
tim
this
guy
is
a
queer
duck
been
around
here
quite
a
while
but
joey
do
know
what
his
game
he
goes
off
on
trips
upriver
stays
quite
a
while
comes
back
unexpected
and
nobody
knows
where
he
been
or
why
he
do
use
brazilian
boatmen
gits
his
men
on
the
other
side
and
the
peru

goes
or
anyways
they
say
they
do
two
of
come
over
here
awhile
back
and
got
drunk
and
joey
tried
to
pump
but
all
the
dope
he
got
was
that
this
here
fritz
goes
away
upstream
to
a
camp
and
from
there
he
goes
off
into
the
bush
alone
and
the
peru
guys
jest
hang
around
the
camp
till
he
gits
back
sounds
kind
o
fishy
to
me
and
joey
says
it
does
to
him
too
but
he
could
work
nothin
more
out
o
the
drunks
because
about
that
time
himself
comes
buttin
in
and
asks
these
guys
what
they
think
they
doin
on
this
side
the
river
and
they
beat
it
back
to
peru
toot
sweet
he
got
their
goat
all
right
and
i
would
wonder
if
he
got
joey
too
anyways
joey
tells
me
he
off
this
geezer
and
advises
me
to
lay
off
him
too
though
he
ca
name
a
thing
against
him
queer
said
knowlton
looking
again
at
the
canoe
out
on
the
water
gun
running
suggested
mckay
nope
tim
contradicted
i
thought
o
that
but
joey
says
nothin
to
it
they
watched
this
sourkrout
close
and
he
do
never
git
no
guns
from
nowheres
besides
they
nobody
up
there
to
run
guns
to
but
injuns
and
them
injuns
are
so
wild
they
do
want
no
guns
they
stick
to
the
bow
and
arrer
and
such
stuff
which
they
sure
know
how
to
use
whatever
his
game
is
he
plays
a
lone
hand
as
far
this
town
knows
got
no
pals
here
and
nobody
wants
to
walk
on
his
corns
may
be
perfectly
all
right
too
mused
knowlton
a
little
gold
cache
or
something
though
he
said
there
was
none
in
this
region
oh
well
what
do
we
care
we
have
our
hands
full
with
our
own
business
and
all
assistance
is
appreciated
an
hour
drifted
past
men
of
the
town
lounged
by
looking
curiously
at
the
strangers
some
nodding
and
voicing
a
friendly
women
too
watched
them
from
windows
and
doors
and
children
slyly
peeped
around
corners
until
something
more
important
such
as
a
cat
a
goat
or
a
gorgeous
butterfly
came
their
way
tim
went
inside
and
slicked
up
a
bit
by
buttoning
and
lacing
his
clothes
and
combing
his
rebellious
hair
at
length
a
long
boat
put
out
from
the
farther
shore
and
came
surging
across
the
river
handle
themselves
well
mckay
approved
noting
the
easy
grace
of
the
crew
in
the
bow
a
tall
slender
fellow
stood
with
arms
folded
balancing
himself
to
the
sway
of
the
rather
clumsy
craft
and
watching
the
water
ahead
in
the
stern
on
a
little
platform
whence
he
could
look
over
the
heads
of
the
others
and
catch
any
signal
from
the
lookout
a
squat
steersman
lounged
against
his
crude
rudder
between
these
two
the
paddlers
stood
each
with
one
foot
on
the
bottom
of
the
long
dugout
and
the
other
on
the
gunwale
swinging
in
nonchalant
unison
as
their
blades
moved
fore
and
aft
under
the
curving
roof
of
a
cabin
open
at
the
sides
to
allow
free
play
of
air
schwandorf
lolled
like
some
barbarian
king
down
to
the
landing
place
trudged
the
three
americans
and
there
the
employers
and
the
prospective
employees
looked
one
another
over
with
interest
eight
men
had
come
with
schwandorf
and
a
hard
gang
they
were
the
bowman
hawk
nosed
slant
eyed
black
mustached
with
hairy
chest
showing
under
his
unbuttoned
cotton
shirt
had
the
face
and
bearing
of
a
buccaneer
chieftain
and
the
effect
was
intensified
by
a
flaring
red
handkerchief
around
his
head
and
the
haft
of
a
knife
protruding
from
his
waistband
the
rowers
behind
him
though
of
varying
degrees
of
swarthiness
and
height
all
had
the
same
sinewy
build
the
same
bold
stare
the
same
insolence
of
manner
and
though
none
but
the
lookout
wore
the
piratical
red
around
his
brow
more
than
one
knife
hilt
showed
at
their
waists
the
steersman
whose
skin
and
flat
face
betokened
a
heavy
strain
of
indian
blood
gazed
stolidly
at
the
americans
with
the
unwinking
expressionless
eyes
of
a
snake
back
into
the
minds
of
mckay
and
knowlton
came
schwandorf
words

not
afraid
of

mckay
ran
a
cold

along
the
line
of

plumbing
each
under
that
chill

he
asserted
in
the
brusque
tone
of
a
captain
inspecting
his
company
numbers
three
and
four
fall
out
literal
obedience
would
have
put
three
and
four
into
the
river
wherefore
they
stood
fast
but
though
they
did
not
quite
understand
the
meaning
of
the
words
they
grasped
the
fact
that
they
were
not
wanted
one
laughed
impudently
the
other
slid
a
poisonous
glance
at
the

the
squat

scowled
so
did
schwandorf
no
man
who
can
not

on

mckay
declared
also
six

are
enough
if
necessary
we
will
bear
a
hand
at
the
paddles

josé
you

been
told
by

i
am

understand
capitan
all
right
on
your
way
as
the
boat
drew
out
the
two
rejected
men
bade
the
americans
an
ironical
and
one
spat
in
the
stream
in
the
faces
of
the
others
however
showed
something
like
respect
for
the
captain
and
josé
snarled
something
at
the
three
and
four
you
might
need
those
men
mumbled
schwandorf

answered
serenely
turning
toward
the
hotel
come

let
get
our
stuff
ready
to
ride
less
than
two
hours
later
their
rooms
were
vacant
their
duffle
was
stowed
in
the
long
dugout
the
peruvian
crew
stood
arrogantly
eying
the
brazilians
who
had
gathered
to
witness
the
departure
and
the

were
bidding

a

and
getting
in

a
double
embrace
from
that

whereafter
he
winked
and
grinned
expansively
at
several

in
violent
hues

and
green
frowned
slightly
at
schwandorf
lit
the
last
cigar
he
was
to
smoke
for
many
a
long
day
and
as
the
dugout
began
to
move
erupted
into
a
more
or
less
musical
farewell
to
the
females
of
the
species
the
yanks
are
goin
away
they
movin
on
the
yanks
are
goin
away
they
say
leavin
the

in
a
heartless
way
with
one
final
wave
of
his
cigar
to
the
gesticulating
joao
and
the
grinning
women
he
turned
his
back
on
the
town
and
faced
the
river
and
the
inscrutable
jungle
but
neither
his
eyes
nor
his
thoughts
traveled
beyond
the
bow
of
the
boat
through
narrowed
lids
he
studied
the
swaying
paddlers
and
the
piratical
josé
and
in
his
mind
echoed
the
whispered
warning
of
joao
delivered
during
the
effusive
embrace
at
parting
comrade
watch
those
chapter
vi
in
the
night
watch
day
by
day
the
long
canoe
crawled
into
the
vast
unknown
day
by
day
the
jungle
river
pushed
steadily
sullenly
against
its
prow
as
if
striving
to
repel
the
invasion
of
its
secret
places
by
the
men
of
another
continent
day
by
day
it
slid
past
in
resentful
impotence
conquered
by
the
swinging
blades
of
the
peruvian
and
day
by
day
the
close
companionship
of
canoe
and
camp
seemed
to
weld
the
voyagers
into
one
compact
unit
through
hours
of
blazing
sun
when
the
mercury
of
the
thermometer
which
knowlton
had
hung
inside
the
shady
cabin
fluctuated
well
above
degrees
the
hardy
crew
forged
on
through
drenching
rains
they
still
hung
doggedly
to
their
work
suspending
it
only
when
the
water
fell
in
such
drowning
quantities
that
they
were
forced
to
tie
up
hastily
to
shore
and
seek
cover
in
order
to
breathe
when
sunset
neared
they
picked
with
unerring
eye
a
spot
fit
for
camping
attacked
the
bush
with
whirling
machetes
cleared
a
space
threw
up
pole
frameworks
swiftly
thatched
them
with
great
palm
leaves
and
thus
created
from
the
jungle
two
crude
but
efficient
huts
one
for
themselves
and
one
for
their
when
night
had
shut
down
and
all
hands
squatted
around
the
fire
in
a
nightly
smoke
talk
they
regaled
their
employers
with
wild
tales
of
adventures
in
bush
and
town
some
of
which
were
not
at
all
polite
but
all
of
which
were
mightily
interesting
and
despite
all
discomforts
fatigue
and
the
minor
incidents
and
accidents
which
often
lead
fellow
travelers
in
the
wilderness
to
bickering
and
bitterness
no
friction
developed
between
the
men
of
the
north
and
the
men
of
the
south
not
that
the
peruvians
were
at
all
obsequious
or
servile
they
were
a
reckless
lawless
godless
gang
perpetually
bearing
themselves
with
the
careless
insolence
which
had
characterized
them
at
first
blasphemous
of
speech
toward
one
another
but
never
toward
the
north
americans
disputes
arose
among
them
with
volcanic
suddenness
and
more
than
once
knives
were
half
drawn
only
to
be
slipped
back
under
the
of
the
josé
who
damned
the
disputants
completely
and
promised
to
cut
out
the
bowels
of
any
man
daring
to
lift
his
blade
clear
of
its
sheath
five
minutes
afterward
the
fire
eaters
would
be
on
as
good
terms
as
ever
shrugging
and
grinning
at
their
passengers
particularly
tim
who
shaking
his
head
disgustedly
would
grumble
aw
pickles
another
frog
fight
gone
bust
yet
tim
for
all
his
disparagement
of
these
abortive
spats
knew
full
well
that
any
one
of
them
held
the
makings
of
a
deadly
duel
and
that
josé
lurid
threats
were
no
mere
latin
hyperbole
he
realized
that
the
bowman
ruled
his
crew
exactly
as
any
of
the
buccaneers
whom
he
resembled
had
governed
their
gangs
by
the
iron
hand
and
that
though
these
men
sailed
no
spanish
main
and
flew
no
black
flag
the
government
was
needed
he
saw
also
that
the
courtesy
of
this
crowd
toward
their
passengers
was
due
largely
to
the
attitude
of
captain
mckay
who
had
enforced
their
respect
at
the
start
by
his
soldierly
bearing
and
retained
it
ever
since
by
his
military
management
for
the
captain
experienced
in
directing
men
conducted
himself
at
all
times
as
a
commanding
officer
should
he
saw
all
said
little
treated
josé
as
a
subordinate
officer
and
left
the
handling
of
the
crew
entirely
to
him
his
aloofness
forestalled
any
of
that
familiarity
which
with
such
a
gang
would
have
led
to
contempt
on
the
other
hand
his
avoidance
of
any
assumption
of
meddlesome
authority
prevented
the
irritation
and
dislike
which
free
men
inevitably
feel
for
the
type
of
leader
thus
he
cannily
steered
himself
and
his
mates
between
the
two
rocks
which
might
have
wrecked
the
expedition
before
it
was
well
started
and
knowlton
and
tim
seeing
and
understanding
followed
his
example
so
the
days
and
nights
rolled
by
the
miles
of
jungle
shore
fell
away
behind
and
save
for
the
occasional
outbreaks
between
members
of
the
crew
all
was
serene
to
all
appearances
the
peruvians
were
interested
in
serving
their
employers
faithfully
and
the
north
americans
were
gliding
onward
with
no
thought
of
insecurity
yet
appearances
frequently
are
deceptive
in
the
heat
of
the
day
in
fact
before
the
broiling
sun
neared
the
zenith
tim
and
knowlton
habitually
fell
asleep
inside
the
not
to
awake
until
two
hours
before
sunset
when
according
to
the
routine
agreed
upon
the
night
camping
place
would
be
sought
and
two
or
three
of
the
peruvians
would
go
into
the
bush
with
rifles
seeking
fresh
meat
mckay
never
slept
during
the
day
traverse
nothing
escaped
his
eye
from
the
time
when
he
emerged
from
his
mosquito
net
in
the
misty
morning
until
he
entered
it
again
by
firelight
the
men
in
the
boat
the
floating
alligators
and
wading
birds
of
the
water
the
flashing
parrots
jacamars
toucans
trogons
and
hummers
of
the
air
the
lizards
and
nervous
spider
monkeys
of
the
tangled
tree
branches
alongshore
all
these
he
watched
quietly
as
the
boat
forged
on
and
the
sinister
francisco
watching
him
in
turn
and
the
paddlers
throwing
occasional
glances
his
way
came
to
regard
him
as
the
only
alert
member
of
the
trio
wherein
they
erred
the
truth
was
that
every
one
of
the
three
adventurers
was
on
his
guard
tim
had
not
forgotten
the
last
words
of
his
boon
companion
joao
and
at
the
first
opportunity
he
had
quietly
passed
on
that
warning
moreover
mckay
and
knowlton
without
discussing
the
matter
had
meditated
on
the
unexpected
assistance
of
schwandorf
the
speed
with
which
the
crew
had
been
obtained
the
promptness
of
josé
to
accept
the
first
payment
offered
and
other
things
wherefore
it
had
come
about
that
at
no
hour
of
the
was
every
eye
and
ear
closed
and
the
real
reason
why
red
tim
and
blond
knowlton
slept
by
day
was
that
they
thus
made
up
the
slumber
lost
at
night
not
that
either
of
them
patrolled
the
camp
in
sentry
go
so
far
as
the
peruvians
knew
they
slept
as
soundly
as
mckay
but
lying
in
their
hammocks
they
divided
the
night
watches
between
them
on
a
schedule
as
regular
as
that
of
a
military
camp
though
the
shifts
necessarily
were
longer
as
sunset
came
always
at
six
and
all
hands
sought
their
hanging
beds
two
hours
later
tim
tour
of
duty
lasted
until
one
in
the
morning
when
the
phosphorescent
hands
of
his
watch
pointed
to
that
hour
he
stealthily
reached
out
and
jabbed
knowlton
sleeping
beside
him
when
a
barely
audible
all
right
reached
his
ears
he
was
officially
relieved
night
followed
night
became
a
week
lengthened
into
a
fortnight
still
so
far
as
the
crew
was
concerned
nothing
happened
a
little
rough
banter
among
them
as
they
smoked
their
last
cigarettes
then
sleep
and
snores
and
that
was
all
until
morning
men
less
experienced
in
night
vigils
than
the
would
have
abandoned
their
watches
long
before
this
if
indeed
they
had
ever
adopted
them
but
these
three
were
schooled
in
patience
moreover
neither
tim
nor
knowlton
had
ever
before
penetrated
the
jungle
and
at
times
the
light
of
the
waxing
moon
revealed
to
their
eyes
strange
things
which
they
never
would
have
seen
by
day
so
the
tedium
of
the
long
hours
of
wakefulness
might
be
broken
at
any
moment
once
they
camped
close
to
a
conical
hillock
of
compact
earth
some
four
feet
high
and
almost
stone
hard
from
which
radiated
narrow
covered
galleries
the
citadel
and
viaducts
of
a
community
of
termites

still
harboring
vivid
recollections
of
his
ant
battle
at
remate
de
males
though
by
this
time
he
had
trained
himself
to
sleep
in
his
hammock
where
he
was
comparatively
safe
looked
askance
at
it
when
told
what
it
was
and
was
only
partly
reassured
by
the
information
that
termites
were
eaters
of
wood
rather
than
of
flesh
after
sleep
had
embraced
the
rest
of
the
camp
he
still
was
uneasy
lifting
his
net
at
long
intervals
and
squinting
at
the
moonlit
mound
as
if
expecting
a
horde
of
insects
to
erupt
from
it
and
charge
him
and
during
one
of
these
inspections
he
saw
something
totally
unexpected
from
the
black
shadows
of
the
forest
had
emerged
another
shadow
so
grotesque
and
misshapen
that
it
seemed
a
figment
of
indigestion
and
weird
dreams
a
thing
from
whose
shaggy
body
protruded
what
appeared
to
be
only
a
long
tubular
snout
where
a
head
should
be
and
which
looked
to
be
overbalanced
at
the
other
end
by
a
great
mass
of
hair
it
stood
stone
still
and
for
the
moment
tim
could
not
decide
which
end
of
it
was
head
and
which
was
tail
or
even
whether
it
were
not
and
headless
then
slowly
the
apparition
moved
into
that
earth
it
dug
huge
hooked
claws
and
from
its
tapering
muzzle
a
wormlike
tongue
licked
about
gathering
the
outrushing
white
ants
into
its
gullet
for
minutes
tim
lay
blinking
at
it
wondering
if
he
really
saw
it
then
picking
up
his
rifle
he
slipped
outside
his
net
and
advanced
on
the
creature
the
animal
turned
sat
back
on
its
great
tail
lifted
its
terrible
claws
and
waited
six
feet
away
just
out
of
its
reach
tim
stopped
and
stared
anew
then
he
grinned
you
win
feller
he
informed
the
beast
what
ye
are
i
dunno
but
any
critter
that
got
the
guts
to
ramble
right
into
camp
and
offer
to
gim
me
a
battle
is
too
good
a
sport
for
me
to
shoot
help
yourself
to
all
the
ants
in
the
world
for
all
o
me
i
goin
back
to
bed
bon
sewer
monseer
wherewith
still
grinning
but
warily
watching
he
backed
until
sure
the
big
invader
would
not
spring
at
him
knowing
nothing
of
ant
bears
he
did
not
know
it
was
hardly
a
springing
animal
its
claws
looked
sufficiently
formidable
to
disembowel
a
man
as
indeed
they
were
if
the
man
came
near
enough
but
when
tim
had
withdrawn
and
the
sluggish
brute
had
decided
that
it
would
not
need
to
defend
itself
it
sank
to
and
passed
stiffly
away
into
the
shades
whence
it
had
come
on
another
night
when
tim
slept
knowlton
detected
a
creeping
slithering
sound
which
made
him
slip
off
the
safety
catch
of
his
pistol
and
peer
at
the
hut
where
slept
the
crew
no
man
was
moving
there
still
the
sound
persisted
lifting
his
net
he
spied
beyond
the
hut
of
the
peruvians
a
moving
mass
on
the
ground
a
cylindrical
bulk
which
looked
to
be
two
feet
thick
and
which
glided
past
like
a
solid
stream
of
dark
water
flowing
along
above
the
dirt
its
beginning
and
end
were
hidden
in
the
bush
and
not
until
it
tapered
into
nothing
and
was
gone
did
he
realize
fully
that
he
had
been
gazing
at
an
enormous
anaconda
then
he
kicked
himself
for
not
shooting
it
but
before
long
he
congratulated
himself
for
letting
it
go
perhaps
an
hour
later
the
startled
forest
resounded
with
an
agonized
scream
so
piercing
and
so
appallingly
human
that
all
the
camp
sprang
awake
the
outcry
came
but
once
sounding
from
some
place
not
far
off
near
the
water
edge
and
in
the
direction
toward
which
the
huge
serpent
had
disappeared
before
the
watcher
had
time
to
tell
the
others
of
what
he
had
seen
one
of
the
boatmen
discovered
the
rut
left
in
the
soft
ground
by
the
reptile
thereafter
knowlton
kept
his
own
counsel
listening
to
the
excited
curses
of
the
men
and
observing
their
pallor
and
their
nervous
scanning
of
the
shadows
josé
said
the
screech
undoubtedly
was
the
death
shriek
of
some
animal
caught
and
crushed
in
the
snake
tremendous
coil
mckay
concurred
with
a
nod
and
when
knowlton
casually
said
it
was
tough
that
nobody
had
been
awake
to
shoot
the
thing
as
it
passed
the
camp
josé
emphatically
disagreed
a
bullet
fired
into
that
fiendish
giant
he
averred
would
have
meant
death
to
one
or
more
men
for
the
serpent
writhing
coils
and
lashing
tail
would
have
knocked
down
the
and
shattered
the
spines
of
any
men
they
struck
no
let
señor
knowlton
thank
the
saints
that
the
awful
master
of
the
swamps
had
gone
its
way
unmolested
for
the
rest
of
that
night
knowlton
kept
his
watch
openly
accompanied
by
josé
and
three
of
the
paddlers
who
refused
to
sleep
again
until
they
should
be
miles
away
from
the
vicinity
of
that
dread
monster
two
nights
afterward
the
camp
was
aroused
again
tim
alone
saw
the
start
of
the
disturbance
and
he
kept
mum
about
it
because
he
did
not
choose
to
let
the
peruvians
know
he
had
been
on
the
alert
out
from
the
gloom
and
straight
past
the
huts
a
animal
came
charging
madly
for
the
river
carrying
on
its
back
a
ferocious
cat
creature
whose
fangs
were
buried
deep
in
its
steed
neck
a
tapir
attacked
by
a
jaguar
with
a
resounding
plunge
the
elephantine
quarry
struck
the
water
and
was
gone
the
tiger
cat
forced
to
relinquish
its
hold
or
drown
swam
hurriedly
back
to
the
bank
below
the
encampment
where
it
roared
and
spat
and
squalled
in
a
paroxysm
of
baffled
fury
and
though
every
man
was
awakened
not
one
left
the
flimsy
shelter
of
his
net
nor
did
anyone
so
much
as
speak
until
tim
wearying
of
the
noise
announced
his
intention
to
go
bust
that
critter
in
the
nose
and
give
him
somethin
to
yowl
about
the
proposal
met
with
instant
and
peremptory
veto
as
you
were
snapped
mckay
let
him
alone
you
would
have
a
chinaman
chance
in
that
black
bush
a
jaguar
is
bad
all
the
time
and
when
he
mad
he
deadly
never
fool
with
one
of
those
beasts
tim
i
met
them
before
and
i
know
what
they
can
do
to
which
josé
agreed
with
many
picturesque
oaths
declaring
that
a
jaguar
was
no
mere
beast
it
was
a
devil
tim
grumbling
obeyed
orders
the
jaguar
hearing
their
voices
stopped
its
noise
and
probably
reconnoitered
the
camp
but
no
man
saw
the
brute
and
its
next
roar
sounded
from
some
spot
far
off
in
the
jungle
other
things
too
passed
within
tim
range
of
vision
from
time
to
time
in
the
moonlit
hours
a
queer
bony
creature
which
he
took
for
some
new
kind
of
turtle
but
which
really
was
an
armadillo
a
monstrous
hairy
spider
which
slid
like
a
streak
up
his
net
hung
there
for
a
time
decided
to
go
elsewhere
and
departed
with
such
speed
that
the
man
inside
rubbed
his
eyes
and
wondered
if
he
was
seein
things
that
ai
a
couple
of
vampires
which
flitted
in
from
nowhere
like
ghoulish
ghosts
wheeled
and
floated
silently
on
wide
wings
seeking
an
exposed
foot
protruding
from
the
hammocks
found
none
rested
a
moment
on
the
roof
poles
chirping
hoarsely
and
veered
out
again
into
the
night
to
knowlton
watch
came
a
strange
little
monkey
with
great
staring
eyes
and
face
ringed
with
pale
fur
one
of
those
night
apes
seldom
seen
by
man
a
small
troop
of
kinkajous
slender
animals
which
looked
to
be
monkeys
but
were
not
and
which
leaped
deftly
among
the
branches
like
frolicsome
little
devils
let
loose
to
play
under
the
jungle
moon
a
big
scaly
iguana
its
back
ridged
with
saw
teeth
and
its
pendulous
throat
pouch
dangling
grotesquely
under
its
jaw
and
more
than
one
deadly
snake
and
huge
alligator
the
first
gliding
past
with
venomous
head
raised
and
cold
eye
glinting
the
second
lying
quiescent
except
for
occasional
openings
of
horrific
jaws
to
the
ears
of
both
the
hammock
sentinels
came
the
mournful
sounds
of
living
things
unseen
from
the
depths
beyond
drifted
the
weird
plaint
of
the
sloth
crying
in
the
night
oh
me
poor
sloth
goat
suckers
repeated
by
the
hour
their
monotonous
refrains
quao
quao
or
while
a
third
earnestly
exhorted
joao
corta
pao
john
cut
wood
tree
frogs
and
crickets
clacked
and
drummed
and
guaribas
poured
their
awful
discord
into
the
air
and
on
one
bright
breathless
night
there
sounded
over
and
over
a
call
freighted
with
wretchedness
and
despair
the
wail
of
that
lonely
owl
known
to
the
bushmen
as
the
mother
of
the
moon
whose
dreadful
cry
portends
evil
to
those
who
hear
it
sometimes
the
air
shook
with
the
thunderous
concussion
of
some
great
falling
tree
which
long
since
bled
to
death
by
parasitical
plant
growths
now
at
last
toppled
crashing
back
into
the
dank
soil
whence
it
had
forced
its
way
up
into
a
place
in
the
sun
other
noises
infrequent
and
unexplainable
also
drifted
at
long
intervals
from
the
mysterious
blackness
and
in
all
the
medley
of
night
sounds
not
one
was
cheerful
the
burden
of
the
jungle
cacophonic
cantanta
ever
was
the
same
despair
disaster
death
then
came
the
fifteenth
day
it
dawned
red
the
sun
fighting
an
ensanguined
battle
with
the
heavy
morning
mists
and
throwing
on
the
faces
of
the
travelers
a
sinister
crimson
hue
before
that
sun
should
rise
again
some
of
those
faces
were
to
be
stained
a
deeper
red
chapter
vii
cold
steel
some
two
hours
after
the
start
while
knowlton
and
tim
loafed
at
the
fore
end
of
the
cabin
enjoying
the
comparative
coolness
of
the
early
day
another
boat
hove
in
sight
up
ahead
a
longish
craft
manned
by
eight
paddlers
and
without
a
cabin
as
it
came
into
view
its
bowman
tossed
his
paddle
in
greeting
the
peruvians
ignored
the
salutation
the
bowman
after
shading
his
eyes
and
peering
at
the
flamboyant
figure
of
josé
resumed
paddling
without
further
ceremony
evidently
intending
to
pass
in
silence
but
then
mckay
arose
waved
a
hand
and
told
josé
to
steer
for
the
newcomers
josé
with
a
slightly
sour
look
gave
the
signal
to
francisco
and
the
course
changed
the
other
canoe
slowed
and
waited
its
men
watched
the
tall
figure
of
mckay
tim
and
knowlton
scanned
the
bronzed
faces
of
those
men
and
liked
them
at
once
the
paddlers
evidently
were
brazilians
but
of
a
different
type
from
the
sluggish
townsmen
of
remate
de
males
alert
fellows
steady
of
eye
honest
of
face
muscular
of
arm
in
all
a
more
set
of
men
than
the
peruvians
all
three
of
the
americans
noticed
that
no
word
was
exchanged
between
the
two
crews
dia
amigos
spoke
mckay
who
are
you
and
whence
do
you
come
we
are
rubber
workers
of
coronel
nunes
senhor
the
bowman
answered
civilly
we
go
to
make
a
new
camp
this
land
is
a
part
of
the
of
the
coronel
and
we
left
his
headquarters
yesterday
ah
then
the
headquarters
is
above
here
one
more
day
journey
the
man
nodded
i
thank
you
good
fortune
go
with
you
and
with
you
senhor
may
god
protect
you
with
the
words
the
brazilian
glanced
along
the
line
of
peruvian
faces
and
his
eyes
narrowed
though
his
words
were
only
a
respectful
farewell
his
expressive
face
indicated
that
mckay
might
be
badly
in
need
of
divine
protection
at
no
distant
date
as
his
paddle
dipped
and
his
men
nodded
their
francisco
the
sneered
raucously
hah
mere
workers
slaves
and
he
spat
at
the
brazilian
boat
fire
shot
into
the
eyes
of
the
bowman
and
his
comrades
their
muscles
tensed
better
be
slaves
better
be
dogs
than
peruvian
cutthroats
one
retorted
go
your
way
and
keep
to
your
own
side
of
the
river
we
go
where
we
will
and
no
misborn
brazilians
can
stop
us
snarled
francisco
to
which
he
added
obscene
epithets
directed
against
brazilians
in
general
and
the
men
of
coronel
nunes
in
particular
the
unprovoked
insults
angered
the
americans
as
well
as
the
brazilians
knowlton
leaped
through
the
and
confronted
francisco
shut
your
dirty
mouth
he
blazed
for
reply
the
steersman
spat
at
him
the
vilest
name
known
to
man
an
instant
later
his
lips
split
he
sprawled
dazedly
on
his
platform
perilously
close
to
the
edge
knowlton
the
knuckles
of
his
left
fist
bleeding
from
impact
with
the
other
teeth
stood
over
him
in
white
fury
francisco
right
hand
fumbled
for
his
knife
knowlton
promptly
stamped
on
that
hand
with
a
heavy
boot
heel
good
eye
looey
rumbled
tim
voice
at
his
back
boot
him
some
more
for
luck
hey
you
back
up
or
i
drill
ye
for
keeps
this
to
a
pair
of
the
peruvian
paddlers
who
had
come
scrambling
through
the
cabin
after
one
searching
stare
into
tim
hard
blue
eyes
and
a
glance
at
his
fist
curled
around
the
butt
of
his
belt
gun
the
backed
up
a
moment
later
they
were
thrown
boldly
into
their
own
part
of
the
boat
by
josé
who
blistered
them
with
the
profanity
of
three
languages
at
once
then
mckay
came
through
and
took
charge
that
do
tim
same
goes
for
you
merry
josé
i
handle
this
you
francisco
get
up
the
curt
commands
struck
like
blows
every
man
obeyed
and
when
the
squat
steersman
again
stood
up
mckay
went
after
him
roughshod
in
the
colloquial
spanish
of
mexico
and
the
argentine
in
the
man
talk
of
american
army
camps
he
flayed
that
offender
alive
josé
himself
efficient
man
handler
though
he
was
stared
at
his
captain
in
awe
and
francisco
though
not
given
to
cringing
skulked
like
a
beaten
dog
when
the
verbal
flagellation
was
finished
turning
then
to
the
brazilians
mckay
formally
apologized
for
the
insults
to
them
it
is
nothing
senhor
coolly
answered
the
bowman
though
his
glance
at
the
peruvians
said
plainly
that
it
would
have
been
something
but
for
the
swift
punishment
by
the
americans
again
i
say
may
god
protect
you
adeos
the
brazilian
boat
glided
away
the
peruvian
craft
crawled
on
upstream
in
silence
when
the
next
camp
was
made
all
apparently
had
forgotten
the
affair
the
men
badgered
one
another
as
usual
though
none
mentioned
split
mouth
and
francisco
himself
albeit
sulky
betrayed
no
sign
of
enmity
after
nightfall
the
regular
meeting
was
held
and
at
the
usual
time
all
turned
in
one
more
night
of
listening
to
the
sounds
of
the
tropical
wilderness
seemed
all
that
lay
ahead
of
the
secret
sentinels
sleep
enveloped
the
huts
snores
and
gurgles
rose
and
fell
tim
himself
for
the
sake
of
effect
snored
heartily
at
intervals
though
his
eyes
never
closed
through
his
mosquito
bar
he
could
see
only
vaguely
but
he
knew
any
man
walking
from
the
crew
quarters
must
cast
a
very
visible
shadow
across
that
net
and
to
him
the
shadow
would
be
as
good
a
warning
as
a
clear
view
of
the
substance
but
the
hours
crept
on
and
no
shadow
came
at
length
however
a
small
sound
reached
his
alert
ear
a
sound
different
from
the
regular
noises
of
the
bush
a
stealthy
creeping
noise
like
that
of
a
big
snake
or
a
huge
lizard
it
came
from
the
ground
a
few
feet
away
and
it
seemed
to
be
gradually
advancing
toward
his
own
hammock
whatever
the
creature
was
that
made
it
its
method
of
progress
was
not
human
but
reptilian
puzzled
suspicious
yet
doubtful
tim
lifted
the
rear
side
of
his
net
on
which
no
moonlight
fell
head
out
he
watched
for
the
crawling
thing
to
come
close
it
came
and
for
an
instant
he
was
in
doubt
as
to
its
character
for
around
it
lay
the
deep
shadow
of
some
treetops
which
at
that
point
blocked
off
the
moon
it
inched
along
on
its
stomach
its
black
head
seeming
round
and
minus
a
face
its
body
broad
but
flat
a
thing
that
looked
to
be
a
man
but
not
a
man
then
pausing
it
raised
its
head
and
peered
toward
the
hammock
of
knowlton
with
that
movement
tim
doubts
vanished
the
lifting
of
the
head
showed
the
face
the
face
of
francisco
the
face
of
murder
in
its
teeth
was
clamped
a
bare
knife
forthwith
tim
applied
general
order
number
thirteen
in
one
bound
he
was
outside
his
net
colliding
with
knowlton
who
awoke
instantly
in
another
he
was
beside
the
assassin
who
with
a
lightning
grab
at
the
knife
in
his
mouth
had
started
to
spring
up
tim
wasted
no
time
in
grappling
or
clinching
he
kicked
his
heavy
boot
backed
by
the
power
of
a
hundred
and
ninety
pounds
of
brawn
thudded
into
the
indian
chest
francisco
was
hurled
over
sidewise
on
his
back
another
kick
crashed
against
his
head
above
the
ear
he
went
limp
ye
lousy
snake
grated
tim
crawlin
on
yer
belly
to
knife
a
man
hey
blast
yer
rotten
heart
what

hey
looey
got
yer
gun
on
some
o
these
other
guys
might
git
gay
they
now
true
enough
the
peruvian
gang
was
jumping
from
its
hut
with
another
glance
at
the
prostrate
francisco
to
make
sure
he
was
unconscious
tim
whirled
to
meet
them
fist
on
gun
halt
he
roared
first
guy
passin
this
corner
post
gits
shot
back
up
the
impact
of
his
voice
the
menace
of
his
ready
gun
hand
the
sight
of
knowlton
and
mckay
leaping
out
with
pistols
drawn
stopped
the
rush
at
the
designated
post
but
swift
hands
dropped
and
when
they
rose
again
the
moonlight
glinted
on
cold
steel
capitan
what
happens
here
demanded
josé
ominously
quiet
knife
work
mckay
replied
curtly
your
man
francisco
attempted
to
creep
in
and
murder
señor
knowlton
if
you
and
the
rest
have
similar
intentions
now
your
time
to
try
if
not
put
away
those
knives
knives
what
do
you
mean
look
behind
you
josé
looked
at
once
he
snarled
curses
and
commands
slowly
the
knives
slipped
out
of
sight
the
paddlers
edged
backward
to
their
own
shack
leaving
their
alone
the
capitan
has
it
wrong
asserted
josé
we
awake
to
find
our
being
kicked
in
the
head
we
want
to
know
why
if
francisco
has
done
what
you
say
i
will
deal
with
him
that
i
may
be
sure
allow
me
to
look
very
well
look
josé
advanced
stooped
studied
the
ground
the
position
of
body
the
knife
still
clutched
in
the
nerveless
hand
tim
growlingly
vouchsafed
a
brief
explanation
of
the
incident
when
josé
straightened
up
his
mouth
was
a
hard
line
and
his
eyes
hot
coals
es
we
shall
have
a
new
with
which
he
stooped
again
grasped
the
prone
man
by
the
hair
dragged
him
into
the
moonlit
space
between
the
huts
and
flung
him
down
juan
bring
water
he
ordered
one
of
the
paddlers
looking
queerly
at
him
did
so
josé
deluged
the
senseless
man
francisco
reviving
sat
up
and
scowled
about
him
his
eyes
rested
on
the
three
americans
standing
grimly
ready
shoulder
to
shoulder
before
their
hut
veered
to
his
mates
bunched
in
sinister
silence
beside
their
own
quarters
shifted
again
to
meet
the
baleful
glare
of
josé
his
hand
stole
to
his
empty
sheath
your
knife
francisco
queried
josé
a
menacing
purr
in
his
tone
i
have
it
it
seems
that
you
are
in
haste
to
use
it
too
much
haste
francisco
but
if
you
will
stand
instead
of
crawling
as
before
you
may
have
your
knife
again
and
use
it
too
francisco
staring
sullenly
up
seemed
to
read
in
the
words
more
than
was
evident
to
the
americans
he
lurched
to
his
feet
staggered
caught
his
balance
braced
himself
stood
waiting
you
know
who
commands
here
josé
went
on
you
disobey
you
seek
to
stab
in
the
night
now
or
later
what
is
the
difference
and
now
the
boat
is
too
small
for
both
of
us
josé
ignored
the
interruption
here
is
your
knife
now
use
it
he
flipped
the
weapon
at
the
other
who
caught
it
deftly
josé
dropped
his
right
hand
to
his
waist
an
instant
later
naked
steel
licked
out
at
francisco
throat
the
steersman
knife
flashed
up
caught
the
reaching
blade
knocked
it
with
a
scraping
clink
for
a
few
seconds
the
two
weapons
seemed
welded
together
their
owners
each
striving
to
bear
down
the
other
wrist
then
they
parted
as
the
combatants
sprang
back
josé
twice
to
his
right
francisco
turning
to
preserve
his
guard
now
had
the
light
full
in
his
face
but
the
moon
rode
so
high
that
the
steersman
disadvantage
was
negligible
and
the
next
assault
of
the
was
blocked
as
before
and
this
time
the
wrist
of
the
proved
a
bit
the
better
he
threw
the
attacking
steel
aside
and
struck
in
a
slashing
sweep
at
his
antagonist
stomach
a
convulsive
inward
movement
of
the
bowman
middle
coupled
with
a
swift
made
the
slash
miss
by
a
hair
breadth
with
the
quickness
of
light
josé
was
in
again
his
knife
hand
still
outstretched
sidewise
stopped
with
a
light
smack
of
flesh
on
flesh
then
it
jerked
outward
his
steel
now
was
red
to
the
hilt
one
more
rapid
step
back
a
keen
glance
at
his
opponent
and
josé
stood
at
ease
from
francisco
burst
a
bubbling
groan
he
staggered
his
knife
dropped
his
hands
rose
fumblingly
toward
his
neck
suddenly
his
knees
gave
way
and
he
toppled
backward
to
the
ground
the
silvery
moonlight
disclosed
a
dark
flood
welling
from
his
severed
jugular
with
the
utmost
coolness
josé
ran
two
fingers
down
his
wet
blade
snapped
the
fingers
in
air
and
spoke
to
his
crew
as
i
said
we
shall
have
a
new
julio
you
will
take
the
platform
a
rumble
ran
among
the
men
their
eyes
lifted
from
francisco
to
the
americans
and
in
them
shone
a
wolfish
gleam
the
bowman
turned
sharply
and
faced
them
who
growls
he
rasped
you
julio
yo
julio
answered
harshly
fingering
his
knife
i
will
be
steersman
but
i
steer
downstream
not
up
francisco
spoke
the
truth
now
or
later
what
is
the
difference
let
it
be
now
a
louder
growl
from
the
others
followed
his
words
one
stepped
back
into
the
shadow
of
the
hut
amarillos
yellow
dogs
you
go
upstream
fools
the
americans
must
be
taken
a
raucous
sneer
from
julio
interrupted
him
simultaneously
the
hand
leaped
upward
poising
a
knife
the
gringos
stay
here
and
you
too
you
yanqui
cur
the
poised
knife
hissed
through
the
air
at
josé
out
from
the
crew
house
shot
a
streak
of
fire
and
a
smashing
rifle
report
josé
dodged
staggered
screeched
in
feline
fury
the
knife
buried
in
his
left
arm
mckay
grunted
suddenly
fell
lay
still
god
yelled
tim
cap
gone
clean
looey
with
the
words
he
leaped
aside
and
pulled
his
pistol
just
as
another
rifle
flare
stabbed
out
from
the
other
hut
and
a
bullet
whisked
through
the
space
where
he
had
stood
an
instant
later
he
was
pouring
a
stream
of
lead
at
the
spot
whence
the
burning
powder
had
leaped
knives
flashing
teeth
gleaming
the
other
paddlers
charged
across
the
space
between
the
huts
josé
his
left
arm
helpless
but
his
deadly
right
hand
still
gripping
his
knife
hurled
himself
on
julio
who
had
seized
a
machete
from
somewhere
knowlton
slammed
a
bullet
between
the
eyes
of
the
foremost
who
pitched
headlong
he
swung
the
muzzle
to
the
other
man
chest
yanked
at
the
trigger
got
no
response
the
gun
was
jammed
with
a
triumphant
snarl
the
peruvian
closed
in
slashing
for
the
throat
knowlton
slipped
aside
evaded
the
thrust
swung
the
pistol
down
hard
on
his
assailant
head
the
man
reeled
thrust
again
blindly
missed
knowlton
crashed
his
dumb
gun
down
again
it
struck
fair
on
the
temple
the
man
collapsed
tim
was
charging
across
the
open
at
the
crew
house
josé
and
julio
were
locked
in
a
death
grapple
no
other
living
man
except
knowlton
still
stood
upright
stooping
he
peered
into
the
face
of
mckay
then
he
laid
a
hand
on
the
captain
chest
faint
but
regular
he
felt
the
heart
beating
thank
god
he
breathed
with
a
wary
eye
on
the
battling
peruvians
he
swiftly
raised
the
captain
and
put
him
into
tim
hammock
as
he
turned
back
to
the
fight
tim
emerged
from
the
other
hut
carrying
a
body
which
he
dropped
and
swiftly
inspected
at
the
same
moment
the
fight
of
josé
and
julio
ended
with
a
choked
scream
julio
dropped
writhed
doubled
up
then
he
lay
still
josé
his
face
ghastly
stared
around
him
his
mouth
stretched
in
a
terrible
smile
so
this
ends
it
he
croaked
his
gaze
dropping
to
julio
julio
the
machete
is
not
so
good
as
the
knife
unless
one
has
room
to
swing
it
he
chuckled
hoarsely
and
sank
down
for
an
instant
knowlton
hesitated
his
glance
going
back
and
forth
between
mckay
and
josé
swiftly
then
he
ran
his
finger
tips
over
head
with
a
murmur
of
satisfaction
he
turned
from
his
comrade
and
hurried
to
the
motionless
bowman
over
whom
tim
now
bent
bleedin
to
death
looey
informed
tim
ai
cut
bad
excep
that
arm
that
flyin
knife
must
have
got
an
artery

pull
him

times

fellow
over
there
maybe
i
brained
him
but
i
not
sure
knowlton
was
already
down
on
his
knees
beside
josé
working
fast
to
loop
a
tourniquet
and
stop
the
flow
from
the
pierced
arm
with
a
handkerchief
and
his
pistol
barrel
he
shut
off
the
pulsating
stream
yeah
he
done
judged
tim
rising
from
the
man
whom
knowlton
had
downed
at
last
skull
caved
in
what
ye
paste
him
with
gun
cursed
thing
stuck
them
automats
are
cranky
say
lookit
the
mess
hozy
made
that
guy
knowlton
glanced
at
julio
and
whistled
josé
threat
to
disembowel
a
refractory
member
of
the
crew
had
at
last
been
literally
fulfilled
but
the
lieutenant
had
seen
worse
sights
in
the
trenches
of
france
and
now
he
kept
his
mind
on
his
work
wedging
the
gun
to
hold
the
tourniquet
tight
he
lifted
his
patient
from
the
mud
and
bore
him
to
the
nearest
hammock
in
the
crew
quarters
striding
back
he
found
tim
alternately
bathing
mckay
head
and
giving
him
brandy
in
a
moment
the
captain
eyes
opened
some
bean
ye
got
cap
congratulated
tim
vastly
relieved
at
sight
of
mckay
gray
stare
bullet
bounced
right
off
here
take
another
swaller
attaboy
hey
looey
we
better
pack
this
crease
o
cap
huh
she
keeps
leakin
yep
dip
up
the
surgical
kit
and
give
josé
a
drink
i
have
to
tie
his
artery
too
how
do
you
feel
old
chap
dizzy
mckay
confessed
what
happened
lost
our
crew
was
the
laconic
answer
all
gone
west
but
josé
and
he
bled
white
we
have
to
paddle
our
own
canoe
now
for
a
time
after
his
head
was
bandaged
mckay
lay
quiet
staring
out
at
the
tiny
battlefield
and
at
his
two
mates
working
silently
on
the
wounded
arm
of
josé
when
they
came
back
he
spoke
one
word
schwandorf
yeah
he
the
nigger
in
the
woodpile
i
bet
my
shirt
but
why
his
lay
d
perhaps
josé
knows
suggested
knowlton
but
he
in
no
shape
to
talk
now
let
see
schwandorf
said
he
was
going
to
iquitos
yes
but
that
does
mean
anything
probably
not
well
maybe
josé
can
explain
there
were
some
things
however
which
josé
could
not
have
told
if
he
would
for
he
himself
did
not
know
them
one
was
that
schwandorf
really
had
gone
to
iquitos
where
was
a
radio
station
another
was
that
from
that
radio
station
to
puerto
bermudez
thence
over
the
andes
to
the
coast
and
northward
to

chapter

the
noon
sweltering
hot
a
blazing
sun
pouring
vertical
rays
down
on
a
blinding
river
a
long
canoe
wearily
creeping
up
the
glaring
waters
minus
a
lookout
heedless
of
the
danger
of
sunken
tree
trunks
propelled
by
three
white
men
one
of
whom
wore
a
bandage
around
his
head
steered
perfunctorily
by
a
pallid
pirate
whose
left
arm
hung
in
a
sling
atop
the
right
bank
an
unbroken
endless
tangle
of
jungle
growth
ahead
on
the
left
shore
a
gap
gouged
out
of
the
forest
and
a
number
of
boats
at
the
water
edge
guess
that
it
panted
knowlton
shielding
his
eyes
and
squinting
at
the
clearing
one
more
day
journey
the
brazilian
chap
said
been
two
and
a
half
one
day
journey
for
six
hardened
rivermen
señor
corrected
josé
not
for
three
men
doing
six
men
work
and
hampered
by
a
cripple
aw
ye
no
crip
hozy
dissented
tim
any
guy
that
can
steer
a
tub
like
this
here
after
losin
a
couple
gallons
o
juice
is
in
good
shape
yet
i
say
if
ye
had
both
legs
shot
off
and
yer
arms
broke
and
yer
head
stove
in
now
ye
might
call
yourself
sort
helpless
ease
her
over
to
the
left
a
more
so
we
hit
the
bank
right
at
the
corner
o
that
gap
me
i
do
want
to
take
one
stroke
more
i
have
to
every
muscle
in
me
is
so
sore
it
squeaks
same
here
admitted
knowlton
i
one
solid
ache
josé
nodded
the
clumsy
craft
veered
a
bit
the
three
put
a
little
more
punch
into
their
lagging
strokes
noting
as
they
neared
the
steep
bank
that
a
couple
of
men
had
appeared
at
its
top
and
were
staring
at
them
gradually
the
long
dugout
worked
in
to
the
muddy
shore
where
the
paddlers
stabbed
their
blades
into
the
clay
and
held
it
firm
ahoy
up
there
this
the
nunes
from
the
edge
some
thirty
feet
above
the
taller
of
the
two
watchers
answered
senhor
the
headquarters
of
the
coronel
do
you
come
to
visit
him
right
then
permit
me
to
help
you
the
path
is
a
little
ahead
pull
up
and
tie
to
this
stake
the
tall
fellow
came
dropping
swiftly
downward
at
the
same
time
the
other
brazilian
stepped
back
and
was
gone
with
a
dexterous
twist
the
man
of
nunes
moored
the
boat
to
the
designated
stake
then
he
reached
a
hand
toward
tim
to
help
him
out
i
ai
no
old
woman
feller
tim
refused
and
hopped
aground
unassisted
mckay
and
knowlton
followed
but
josé
after
moving
languidly
forward
and
contemplating
the
sharp
slope
hesitated
and
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
am
tired
señores
he
said
and
perhaps
it
would
be
well
for
one
to
stay
here
and
watch
the
tall
brazilian
eyes
narrowed
there
is
no
danger
of
loss
he
asserted
with
dignity
we
men
of
the
coronel
are
not
thieves
the
slight
emphasis
of
his
last
sentence
might
have
been
taken
as
an
intimation
that
some
one
else
not
far
away
would
bear
watching
mouth
tightened
for
a
moment
brazilian
and
peruvian
eyed
each
other
in
obvious
dislike
then
with
a
glance
at
his
crippled
arm
josé
shrugged
again
better
come
along
josé
mckay
said
stuff
safe
enough
as
you
will
capitan
he
lounged
to
the
edge
hesitated
wavered
slightly
at
once
the
brazilian
darted
out
a
hand
and
gave
him
support
and
while
the
four
clambered
up
the
slope
he
retained
a
grip
on
the
peruvian
arm
aiding
him
to
the
top
when
they
emerged
on
the
level
however
he
dropped
his
hand
immediately
josé
gave
him
a
bow
of
thanks
to
which
he
replied
with
a
short
nod
then
he
stepped
back
and
let
the
peruvian
precede
him
toward
a
number
of
substantial
houses
a
hundred
yards
away
no
love
lost
between
them
two
thought
tim
who
had
watched
it
all
good
skate
though
this
new
feller
ready
to
help
a
guy
that
needs
it
whether
he
likes
him
or
not
ready
to
knock
his
block
off
too
if
he
needs
that
bet
he
be
a
hellion
in
a
scrap
dang
lad
too
wherewith
he
introduced
himself
do
git
sore
because
i
growled
at
ye
down
below
he
said
with
a
friendly
grin
sounded
rough
mebbe
but
that
my
style
i
tim
ryan
from
the
states
i
bark
more
i
bite
the
overture
met
with
instant
response
a
quick
smile
and
a
twinkle
in
the
warm
eyes
it
is
not
words
that
give
offense
senhor
but
the
way
they
are
spoken
and
the
man
who
speaks
them
one
man
may
growl
but
you
like
him
another
may
speak
smoothly
but
you
itch
to
strike
him
is
it
not
so
i
am
pedro
andrada
a
who
should
be
tapping
trees
instead
of
loafing
here
but
my
partner
and
i
have
just
come
in
from
a
long
trip
into
the
wilderness
and
are
resting
yeah
was
that
yer
buddy
i
seen
with
ye
my
ah
buddee
partner
yes
that
was
he
lourenço
moraes
the
best
comrade
one
ever
had
he
has
gone
to
tell
the
coronel
of
your
arrival
have
you
met
with
an
accident
downriver
he
moved
a
thumb
meaningly
toward
the
only
remaining
member
of
the
crew
yeah
grimly
bad
accident
tim
tapped
his
pistol
significently
raised
five
fingers
winked
and
twitched
his
head
toward
the
peruvian
pedro
lifted
his
brows
nodded
quick
understanding
pointed
to
the
bad
arm
of
josé
and
made
motions
as
if
pulling
a
trigger
tim
shook
his
head
and
enacted
the
pantomime
of
drawing
and
throwing
a
knife
whereat
the
brazilian
aware
that
josé
was
not
a
prisoner
and
probably
knowing
that
north
americans
were
not
knife
throwers
looked
much
puzzled
but
their
sign
manual
went
no
farther
for
they
now
approached
the
house
which
evidently
formed
the
dwelling
and
office
of
coronel
nunes
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
stood
a
deeply
tanned
man
who
without
speaking
pointed
a
thumb
upward
above
in
the
doorway
waited
an
elderly
brazilian
of
medium
height
and
spare
figure
standing
with
soldierly
erectness
and
garbed
in
white
duck
of
semimilitary
cut
he
beamed
down
at
mckay
and
knowlton
but
as
his
black
eyes
encountered
those
of
josé
they
seemed
suddenly
to
become
very
sharp
then
his
gaze
rested
on
tim
broad
face
and
he
smiled
again
enter
gentlemen
he
invited
casa
e
a
suas
this
house
is
at
your
disposal
mckay
with
a
bow
climbed
the
ladder
followed
by
knowlton
josé
with
a
swaggering
stare
at
the
man
who
stared
straight
back
without
facial
change
also
went
up
tim
came
fourth
and
last
for
pedro
stopped
beside
his
countryman
who
evidently
was
lourenço
the
travelers
found
themselves
in
a
room
which
in
view
of
its
distance
from
civilization
seemed
palatial
its
floor
was
tight
its
furniture
modern
its
walls
decorated
with
a
few
excellent
pictures
of
which
the
largest
was
a
superb
view
of
the
rugged
harbor
of
rio
de
janeiro
comfortable
chairs
were
ranged
along
the
walls
and
the
middle
of
the
room
was
occupied
by
a
massive
table
on
which
lay
a
jumble
of
business
papers
a
number
of
books
a
violin
and
bow
beyond
the
table
stood
a
swivel
chair
evidently
the
usual
seat
of
the
coronel
table
and
chair
were
so
arranged
that
the
master
of
this
house
sat
always
with
his
back
to
a
wall
and
his
face
toward
the
door
and
on
a
couple
of
hooks
on
that
wall
ready
for
instant
service
hung
a
rifle
on
their
way
up
the
river
the
americans
had
passed
at
long
intervals
a
few
small
rubber
estates
whose
headquarters
consisted
mainly
of
a
crude
shack
or
two
hardly
better
than
the
dingy
houses
of
remate
de
males
this
place
was
more
imposing
they
had
observed
while
crossing
the
cleared
space
that
it
was
at
least
half
a
mile
square
that
its
warehouse
for
supplies
was
big
and
solid
that
a
goodly
number
of
or
rubber
workers
huts
surrounded
the
house
of
the
master
at
a
respectful
distance
and
that
the
owner
home
was
no
cabin
but
big
enough
to
contain
six
or
eight
rooms
this
reception
room
and
the
formal
yet
sincere
courtesy
of
its
owner
showed
that
coronel
nunes
was
no
mere
native
of
the
frontier
later
they
were
to
learn
that
he
was
a
gentleman
of
rio
who
exiling
himself
from
the
capital
after
the
death
of
his
wife
had
carved
from
this
forbidding
jungle
a
fortune
in
the
rubber
trade
with
the
correct
touch
of
latin
punctilio
mckay
spoke
the
introductions
and
stated
that
they
were
on
their
way
upriver
to
explore
the
hinterland
with
equal
politeness
the
coronel
bowed
and
begged
his
illustrious
guests
to
be
seated
then
he
touched
a
small
bell
a
door
at
one
side
opened
and
a
negro
appeared
café
the
coronel
ordered
as
speedily
as
if
these
visitors
had
been
long
expected
the
servant
brought
in
a
tray
bearing
cups
of
syrupy
coffee
each
of
the
guests
accepted
one
whereafter
the
decorum
of
the
occasion
was
shattered
by
tim
who
at
the
imminent
risk
of
scalding
himself
gulped
his
refreshment
and
vociferated
his
satisfaction
boy
that
hits
right
where
i
live
gim
me
another
one
feller
and
make
it
man
size
the
black
fellow
struggled
with
his
quick
mirth
and
then
laughed
outright
the
throaty
infectious
laugh
of
his
race
the
coronel
eyes
twinkled
and
when
tim
fished
a
damp
cigarette
from
his
shirt
nonchalantly
scraped
a
match
on
his
host
table
blew
a
cloud
of
smoke
and
sprawled
back
with
one
leg
dangling
over
a
chair
arm
formality
went
quem
madruga
deus
laughed
the
coronel
or
as
you
north
americans
put
it
helps
those
who
help
themselves
let
us
not
be
ceremonious
gentlemen
bring
more
coffee
and
cigars
and
down
behind
his
table
where
only
the
servant
saw
the
motion
he
twitched
a
finger
as
if
pulling
a
cork
his
ebony
countenance
split
by
a
grin
ducked
his
head
and
vanished
into
the
other
room
how
is
the
rubber
market
sir
asked
knowlton
seeking
to
divert
attention
from
tim
not
so
good
the
old
gentleman
replied
with
a
deprecatory
gesture
in
truth
it
is
very
poor
since
the
war
so
poor
that
soon
i
shall
abandon
this
and
go
out
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
on
the
coast
with
rubber
selling
at
a
mere
five
hundred
dollars
a
ton
in
new
york
and
the
artificial
plantations
of
the
far
east
growing
greater
yearly
there
is
no
longer
much
profit
in
bleeding
the
wild
trees
of
our
jungle
i
really
do
not
know
why
i
stay
here
now
unless
it
is
because
i
have
become
so
much
accustomed
to
this
life
why
i
understood
that
there
was
much
money
in
rubber
you
speak
truth
there
was
now
there
is
not
the
world
moves
and
times
change
years
ago
foreigners
came
into
brazil
helped
themselves
to
the
seed
of
our
wild
trees
and
planted
it
in
ceylon
and
the
malay
region
that
seed
now
bears
such
fruit
that
the
world
is
flooded
with
rubber
ten
years
ago
senhores
a
ton
sold
for
six
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
now
in
this
year
the
price
is
only
of
what
it
was
in
those
days
it
scarcely
pays
for
the
gathering
i
hope
you
have
not
come
expecting
to
make
fortunes
in
rubber
no
we
are
here
to
find
a
race
of
men
known
as
red
bones
the
coronel
brows
lifted
they
kept
on
lifting
and
he
opened
his
lips
twice
without
speaking
after
a
long
stare
at
knowlton
he
looked
at
mckay
at
tim
and
finally
at
josé
a
frown
grew
on
his
face
and
the
americans
following
his
look
at
the
peruvian
were
surprised
to
see
that
josé
himself
was
staring
blankly
at
the
speaker
josé
martinez
snapped
the
coronel
leveling
a
finger
pistollike
at
the
what
devil
game
are
you
working
now
josé
recovered
himself
and
lifted
his
coffee
cup
i
do
not
understand
you
nunes
he
replied
languidly
i
am
but
the
humble
of
the
crew
engaged
by
these
señores
my
only
work
has
been
to
earn
my
pay
and
you
may
ask
whether
i
have
earned
it
ay
he
has
corroborated
mckay
killed
two
of
his
own
crew
in
our
defense
the
coronel
jaw
dropped
he
blinked
as
if
disbelieving
his
ears
he
josé
not
possible
he
stuttered
josé
this
man
defended
you
against
his
companions
exactly
the
brazilian
slowly
shook
his
head
then
suddenly
he
nodded
as
if
an
illuminating
thought
had
crossed
his
mind
i
see
josé
is
very
well
paid
one
dollar
a
day
was
mckay
dry
retort
at
that
moment
with
a
larger
tray
than
before
bearing
more
coffee
long
cigars
and
squat
glasses
in
which
glowed
a
golden
liquid
tim
sat
up
with
a
grunt
and
helped
himself
with
both
hands
when
the
coronel
turn
came
he
disregarded
the
drinks
but
lit
the
cigar
as
if
he
needed
it
noite
todos
os
gatos
sao
he
said
at
night
all
cats
are
gray
i
am
much
in
the
dark
gentlemen
if
you
would
be
so
good
as
to
enlighten
me
he
paused
looking
sidewise
again
at
josé
as
if
the
had
suddenly
grown
wings
or
horns
all
right
nodded
knowlton
biting
and
lighting
his
cigar
we
are
somewhat
in
the
dark
ourselves
as
to
why
josé
has
been
so
zealous
for
he
has
been
very
taciturn
since
the
recent
fight
at
our
camp
perhaps
josé
also
is
a
bit
hazy
about
our
expedition
he
looked
rather
surprised
just
now
so
here
is
the
situation
briefly
then
he
outlined
the
object
of
the
search
stating
that
the
identity
of
the
mysterious
raposa
was
a
matter
of
some
concern
to
certain
persons
in
the
united
states
and
that
the
expedition
had
been
formed
with
the
view
of
settling
the
question
from
the
time
of
the
landing
at
remate
de
males
however
he
narrated
events
more
fully
giving
complete
details
of
schwandorf
activities
francisco
offense
and
the
final
attack
by
the
crew
while
he
talked
the
coronel
frown
deepened
also
josé
gradually
assumed
the
expression
of
a
thundercloud
and
when
the
tale
was
done
the
exploded
de
cristo
he
yelled
the
german
he
told
you
we
would
go
among
the
cannibals
we
peruvians
de
dios
if
ever
i
get
within
knife
length
of
him
nunes
you
see
do
you
not
the
coronel
nodded
grimly
i
see
that
he
planned
to
have
all
of
you
destroyed
senhor
knowlton
that
and
man
suggested
that
you
take
mayoruna
women
he
told
you
they
were
shapely
of
body
and
tried
to
put
into
your
minds
the
thought
of
making
them
your
paramours
the
snake
he
did
not
tell
you
then
that
the
mayoruna
men
allow
no
trifling
with
their
women
that
any
alien
man
attempting
to
embrace
one
of
them
would
be
killed
but
it
is
true
if
you
should
succeed
in
establishing
friendly
relations
with
the
men
which
is
not
at
all
likely
you
would
forfeit
all
friendship
and
your
lives
as
well
by
the
slightest
dalliance
with
any
of
the
women
he
told
you
that
more
than
one
man
has
risked
his
life
to
win
a
mayoruna
woman
that
is
true
but
he
gave
you
a
false
impression
as
to
the
way
in
which
the
risk
was
incurred
he
did
not
tell
you
that
peruvian
have
sometimes
raided
small
isolated
of
the
mayorunas
shooting
down
the
men
and
carrying
off
the
girls
to
be
victims
of
their
bestial
lust
he
did
not
tell
you
that
for
this
reason
any
peruvian
is
considered
their
enemy
and
is
killed
without
mercy
wherever
found
yet
he
tried
to
send
you
with
peruvian
guides
into
their
country
he
knew
the
peruvians
would
be
killed
on
sight
and
you
with
them
chapter
ix
fiddlers
three
black
looks
passed
among
the
men
as
the
duplicity
of
schwandorf
lay
plain
before
their
eyes
tim
growled
josé
hissed
curses
the
coronel
whirled
to
him
josé
what
was
his
object
in
trying
to
destroy
you
and
your
crew
you
have
been
his
man
you
know
much
about
him
he
wanted
to
stop
your
mouth
yes
dead
men
tell
no
tales
the
eyes
glittered
for
a
moment
the
others
thought
he
was
about
to
reveal
important
secrets
then
his
face
changed
i
know
no
reason
why
we
should
be
killed
he
declared
i
do
not
believe
you
the
coronel
declared
bluntly
josé
shrugged
calmly
drank
the
coronel
wine
lighted
the
cigar
leaned
back
in
the
coronel
chair
and
eyed
the
coronel
with
imperturbable
insolence
see
here
josé
demanded
mckay
you
had
something
up
your
sleeve
all
along
now
come
clean
what
is
it
josé
puffed
airily
at
the
cigar
saying
nothing
what
orders
did
schwandorf
give
you
this
time
the
reply
came
readily
enough
to
take
you
days
up
the
river
and
put
you
ashore
to
prevent
any
trouble
before
that
time
ah
and
after
that
nothing
at
least
nothing
to
me
what
may
have
been
said
to
the
other
men
i
do
not
know
schwandorf
came
to
me
last
after
he
had
picked
all
the
others
and
what
do
you
know
about
schwandorf
what
is
between
me
and
schwandorf
will
be
settled
between
me
and
schwandorf
my
duty
to
you
señores
lies
only
in
handling
the
crew
now
that
there
is
no
crew
my
duty
ends
also
capitan
i
would
like
my
pay
now
you
quit
why
not
i
have
done
my
best
i
can
do
no
more
i
am
crippled
i
am
of
no
further
use
to
you
give
me
my
pay
a
little
food
a
small
canoe
and
i
go
it
is
possible
senhor
josé
spoke
the
coronel
with
ironic
politeness
that
you
may
not
go
so
soon
you
have
killed
two
men
recently
you
refuse
to
reveal
some
things
which
should
be
known
about
the
german
perhaps
the
law
josé
burst
into
a
jeering
laugh
law
you
speak
of
law
there
is
no
law
up
the
river
but
the
law
of
the
gun
and
the
knife
and
if
there
were
señor
what
then
i
killed
in
a
fair
fight
i
killed
men
who
would
do
murder
i
killed
on
the
west
bank
of
the
river
peru
neither
you
nor
any
other
brazilian
can
lay
hand
on
me
and
though
i
now
have
only
one
good
arm
it
will
not
be
well
for
anyone
to
try
to
hold
me
my
knife
and
my
right
hand
still
are
ready
by
cripes
the
lad
right
tim
blurted
impulsively
and
i
tell
the
world
i
for
him
he
got
a
right
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
if
he
wants
to
he
do
owe
us
nothin
mebbe
he
got
somethin
up
his
sleeve
at
that
but
he
stuck
with
us
in
the
pinch
and
and
we
give
him
a
square
deal
of
course
knowlton
cut
in
josé
your
own
wages
to
this
point
at
a
dollar
a
day
are
eighteen
dollars
the
wages
of
the
five
other
men
to
the
place
where
they
quit
would
aggregate
dollars
grand
total
the
others
chose
to
take
their
pay
in
lead
instead
of
gold
so
their
account
is
closed
therefore
i
suggest
that
their
pay
go
to
you
as
and
good
sport
what
say
rod
make
it
a
hundred
flat
mckay
agreed
right
a
hundred
in
gold
satisfy
you
josé
indeed
yes
señor
i
did
not
expect
such
generosity
that
all
right
then
we
fix
you
up
before
we
move
on
and
say
are
you
in
schwandorf
pay
too
josé
hesitated
then
he
replied
since
you
mention
it
i
will
admit
that
offered
me
certain
inducements
to
make
this
journey
i
now
see
that
he
had
no
intention
of
meeting
his
promises
but
you
can
leave
it
to
me
to
collect
from
him
whatever
may
be
due
even
the
coronel
nodded
at
this
the
gleam
in
the
peruvian
eyes
presaged
unpleasantness
for
schwandorf
you
gentlemen
of
course
will
not
attempt
to
continue
your
journey
for
the
present
the
coronel
suggested
you
are
fatigued
and
i
shall
greatly
appreciate
the
pleasure
of
your
companionship
new
arrangements
also
will
be
necessary
in
the
matter
of
a
boat
and
men
we
been
wondering
about
getting
another
boat
and
a
new
crew
knowlton
said
frankly
the
canoe
we
have
is
too
big
for
three
men
to
handle
and
i
admit
we
tired
josé
too
is
in
no
shape
to
travel
yet
josé
of
course
is
my
guest
also
the
old
gentleman
interrupted
the
question
of
new
men
can
be
solved
but
there
is
time
for
everything
and
now
is
the
time
for
all
of
you
to
rest
as
our
proverb
has
it
se
vae
ao
he
goes
far
who
goes
slowly
mckay
arose
glass
in
hand
to
our
host
he
bowed
the
toast
was
drunk
standing
whereafter
the
host
tapped
the
bell
twice
and
reappeared
with
a
tray
of
fresh
glasses
a
toast
to
the
united
states
by
the
coronel
followed
and
as
soon
as
the
black
man
arrived
with
a
third
round
the
republic
of
brazil
was
pledged
then
the
coronel
directed
the
servant
if
pedro
and
lourenço
are
outside
ask
them
to
move
the
belongings
of
the
gentlemen
from
the
canoe
and
make
ready
rooms
for
the
guests
disappeared
down
the
ladder
the
coronel
raised
the
violin
tendered
it
to
the
others
accepted
their
pleas
to
play
it
himself
and
for
the
next
half
hour
acquitted
himself
with
no
mean
ability
snatches
of
operas
and
improvisations
of
his
own
flowed
from
the
strings
in
smooth
harmony
hinting
at
bygone
years
amid
far
different
surroundings
for
which
his
soul
now
hungered
and
to
which
he
would
return
pedro
and
lourenço
transporting
the
equipment
passed
in
and
out
and
almost
unnoticed
at
length
the
player
with
a
deprecatory
smile
and
a
half
apology
for
boring
his
guests
extended
the
instrument
again
toward
the
visitors
and
mckay
silent
mckay
took
it
sweet
and
low
out
welled
the
haunting
melody
of
annie
laurie
tim
who
had
listened
with
casual
interest
to
the
coronel
music
now
grinned
happily
and
when
the
plaintive
scotch
song
became
kathleen
mavourneen
he
closed
his
eyes
and
lay
back
in
pure
enjoyment
the
river
shannon
flowed
into
the
suwanee
river
and
this
in
turn
blended
into
other
airs
of
dixieland
when
the
last
strain
died
and
the
captain
reached
for
his
cigar
the
room
was
silent
for
minutes
then
to
the
astonishment
of
all
josé
spoke
señores
there
was
a
time
when
i
too
could
draw
music
from
the
violin
if
i
may
his
eyes
rested
longingly
on
the
instrument
if
you
can
use
the
arm
the
coronel
acquiesced
with
a
little
difficulty
josé
drew
his
arm
from
the
sling
balanced
his
left
elbow
on
the
chair
arm
and
poised
the
violin
a
half
smile
showed
in
the
eyes
of
the
coronel
as
he
glanced
at
his
guests
he
and
they
as
well
expected
a
discordant
uncouth
attempt
to
scrape
out
some
obscene
ditty
of
the
frontier
but
as
josé
after
jockeying
a
bit
began
drifting
the
bow
across
the
strings
the
suppressed
smiles
faded
and
eyes
opened
here
was
a
man
who
as
he
said
once
could
play
and
he
wasted
no
time
on
airs
composed
by
others
and
known
to
half
the
world
under
his
touch
the
mellow
wood
began
to
talk
and
in
the
minds
of
the
listeners
grew
pictures
city
streets
houses
patios
the
rattle
of
the
hoofs
of
burros
over
cobbles
the
shuffle
of
human
feet
the
toll
of
bells
from
a
convent
tower
gay
little
bits
of
music
laughter
flashing
eyes
a
voluptuous
love
song
repeated
over
and
over
a
sudden
wild
outbreak
fighting
men
shots
the
clash
of
steel
again
a
tolling
bell
and
a
requiem
for
the
dead
a
horse
galloping
in
the
night
mountain
winds
crooning
mournfully
rising
to
the
scream
of
tempest
and
the
crash
of
thunder
dreary
uplands
the
hiss
of
rain
the
sough
of
drifting
snow
the
patient
plod
of
a
mule
along
a
perilous
trail
and
then
the
jungle
its
discordant
uproar
its
hammering
of
frogs
its
hoots
and
howls
the
dismal
swash
of
flood
waters
a
monotonous
ebb
and
flow
of
life
punctuated
by
sudden
flares
of
fight
then
a
long
mournful
wail
and
silence
his
bow
still
on
the
strings
josé
sat
for
a
minute
like
a
stone
image
his
eyes
straight
ahead
his
pale
face
drawn
his
red
kerchief
glowing
dully
in
the
semishadow
like
a
cap
of
blood
for
once
his
face
was
empty
of
all
insolence
changed
by
a
pathetic
wistfulness
that
made
it
tragic
then
wordless
he
lowered
the
violin
held
it
out
to
the
coronel
fumbled
absently
at
his
sling
and
slowly
incased
his
wounded
arm
when
he
looked
up
his
old
mocking
expression
had
come
back
and
he
once
more
looked
the
reckless
buccaneer
for
a
time
no
one
spoke
each
felt
that
he
had
glimpsed
something
of
this
man
past
felt
too
that
he
who
now
was
a
borderer
had
once
been
a
moving
in
a
much
higher
circle
certainly
he
could
not
play
like
this
unless
he
had
been
of
the
upper
class
in
his
youth
the
coronel
face
was
thoughtful
as
he
took
back
the
violin
when
at
length
he
began
to
talk
however
it
was
on
a
topic
as
remote
as
possible
from
music
and
present
personalities
the
reconstruction
of
europe
as
the
result
of
the
world
war
with
this
and
kindred
subjects
aided
by
the
attentive
ministrations
of
the
afternoon
passed
swiftly
dinner
proved
a
feast
the
de
being
tender
meat
which
the
americans
took
for
roast
beef
but
which
really
was
roast
tapir
more
cigars
coupled
with
the
fatigue
of
the
past
two
days
of
paddling
eventually
caused
the
visitors
to
seek
their
rooms
where
mckay
and
knowlton
paired
off
and
tim
took
josé
as
his
bunkie
when
tim
awoke
the
next
morning
he
found
himself
deserted
to
knowlton
who
drew
from
the
small
the
hundred
dollars
allotted
to
josé
and
handed
it
to
him
before
redressing
his
wound
the
quietly
revealed
his
intention
to
go
before
sunrise
say
nothing
señor
he
requested
you
need
know
nothing
of
it
if
you
like
i
am
here
i
am
gone
that
is
all
i
am
of
no
further
use
to
you
i
am
unwelcome
in
this
house
of
nunes
and
i
go
oh
have
no
fear
for
me
i
have
my
gun
my
knife
and
my
good
right
arm
and
i
can
take
care
of
myself
very
well
no
doubt
the
coronel
will
be
astonished
to
find
that
on
leaving
i
have
neither
cut
throat
nor
stolen
anything
ha
i
have
a
black
name
on
this
river
and
it
is
well
earned
perhaps
yet
few
men
are
as
bad
as
those
who
dislike
them
think
they
are
i
may
borrow
a
small
canoe
but
any
indian
would
do
the
same
an
unoccupied
canoe
is
any
man
property
before
our
ways
part
señor
let
me
say
that
as
josé
martinez
never
forgets
his
enemies
so
he
never
forgets
friends
where
some
men
would
have
turned
me
loose
like
a
sick
dog
with
my
eighteen
dollars
you
and
señor
mckay
give
me
a
hundred
and
far
more
than
that
you
saved
my
life
at
a
time
when
many
men
would
have
said
let
the
bloody
one
die
he
is
nothing
but
scum
of
the
border
and
leader
of
that
murdering
crew
you
had
only
to
let
me
lie
a
few
minutes
longer
and
you
would
be
rid
of
me
no
josé
does
not
forget
that
is
all
except
if
you
will
in
parting
take
the
hand
of
a
man
known
as
a
killer
and
other
things
knowlton
gripped
that
hand
with
swift
heartiness
he
would
have
protested
against
such
a
departure
but
the
other
steady
gaze
betokened
inflexible
purpose
so
he
merely
said
then
good
luck
old
chap
and
if
you
meet
schwandorf
give
him
our
affectionate
regards
señor
was
the
sardonic
answer
i
will
do
that
thing
and
here
is
something
that
may
be
of
interest
to
you
i
happen
to
know
that
before
we
left
remate
de
males
a
swift
canoe
left
nazareth
and
that
the
man
in
it
was
an
indian
who
is
in
the
german
control
it
went
upstream
while
we
were
loading
your
supplies
and
it
has
not
returned
by
this
time
it
must
be
many
hours
above
this
place
i
do
not
know
what
message
that
indian
carries
nor
where
he
goes
but
he
is
a
short
man
and
his
left
leg
is
crooked
if
you
meet
such
a
one
make
him
talk
señor
just
how
and
when
the
his
way
out
that
night
none
ever
knew
but
himself
but
before
the
next
dawn
he
had
vanished
from
the
brazilian
shore
chapter
x
by
the
light
of
storm
one
thing
i
ca
understand
knowlton
said
toying
with
his
coffee
cup
the
next
morning
is
why
schwandorf
should
us
we
never
did
anything
to
him
another
thing
i
do
quite
get
is
how
he
expected
to
have
the
peruvians
wiped
out
when
he
knew
blamed
well
they
were
aware
of
the
enmity
of
the
cannibals
they
hardly
be
likely
to
go
into
the
bush
with
us
under
those
circumstances
my
guess
is
this
mckay
replied
he
set
a
trap
he
is
on
a
friendly
footing
with
some
of
the
savages
above
here
no
doubt
he
dispatched
that
indian
messenger
to
stir
them
up
with
some
false
tale
and
bring
them
to
some
place
where
they
be
pretty
sure
to
get
us
he
primed
the
crew
to
jump
us
at
the
same
place
perhaps
then
the
crew
would
kill
us
or
we
kill
them
and
whichever
side
won
would
be
smeared
by
the
indians
sort
of
a
trap
within
a
trap
why
he
did
it
does
matter
much
he
us
he
the
crew
he
josé
first
thing
he
knows
he
find
he
himself
yeah
tim
grunted
he
better
beat
it
before
we
git
back
he
wanted
no
killing
before
we
reached
the
cannibal
country
mckay
went
on
because
then
it
would
all
be
blamed
on
the
savages
and
he
could
show
clean
hands
francisco
vengefulness
tipped
over
his
cart
still
he
might
have
known
we
stop
here
for
a
call
on
the
coronel
and
that
there
was
a
big
chance
for
us
to
be
warned
here
about
the
feud
between
mayorunas
and
peruvians
that
probably
was
provided
for
crew
doubtless
had
orders
to
prevent
any
such
visit
by
lying
to
us
or
in
other
ways
we
probably
would
have
gone
surging
past
here
at
top
speed
wal
it
do
git
us
nothin
to
talk
about
things
that
happened
interposed
the
practical
tim
question
is
where
do
we
go
from
here
and
how
all
eyes
went
to
the
coronel
who
sat
languidly
smoking
his
morning
cigar
coronel
we
are
in
your
hands
mckay
said
bluntly
your
men
i
presume
are
all
out
at
work
in
various
parts
of
the
bush
we
want
a
crew
and
if
possible
guides
can
you
help
us
the
coronel
flicked
off
an
ash
and
spoke
slowly
i
have
two
men
senhores
who
have
no
peers
as
bushmen
they
are
the
two
whom
you
saw
yesterday
frankly
they
are
most
valuable
to
me
and
i
hesitate
about
sending
them
on
so
dangerous
a
mission
as
yours
yet
they
might
succeed
where
most
men
would
fail
for
they
have
repeatedly
gone
into
the
bush
on
risky
journeys
and
returned
unharmed
their
adventures
would
fill
books
the
older
of
these
two
lourenço
moraes
has
been
more
than
once
among
the
cannibals
of
this
region
and
so
he
knows
something
of
them
naturally
he
did
not
live
long
among
them
he
left
them
as
soon
as
he
could
but
he
has
the
faculty
of
extricating
himself
from
hopeless
positions
or
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
say
that
his
cool
head
and
good
fortune
together
have
preserved
him

the

may
go
often
to
the

but
some
day
it
remains
there
pedro
andrada
the
younger
is
not
so
steady
and
as
lourenço
yet
he
is
a
most
capable
man
and
the
two
together
they
are
always
together
make
a
very
efficient
team
i
bet
they
do
tim
concurred
heartily
i
like
that
pedro
lad
fine
so
do
i
the
coronel
smiled
now
gentlemen
i
will
not
order
these
men
to
go
with
you
if
they
go
it
must
be
of
their
own
choice
they
have
only
recently
returned
from
a
hazardous
mission
and
they
are
entitled
to
rest
yet
i
have
little
doubt
that
they
will
jump
at
the
chance
to
risk
their
lives
in
a
new
venture
if
they
choose
to
go
i
suggest
that
you
place
yourselves
entirely
in
their
hands
and
give
them
free
rein
you
would
look
far
for
better
men
and
we
lucky
to
get
them
knowlton
acquiesced
to
them
and
to
you
we
shall
be
greatly
indebted
not
to
me
senhor
the
coronel
demurred
i
do
nothing
but
bring
you
men
together
theirs
is
the
risk
find
pedro
and
lourenço
shall
we
go
into
the
office
gentlemen
chairs
scraped
back
and
an
exodus
from
the
dining
room
ensued
outside
the
lusty
voice
of
the
negro
bawled
soon
he
was
back
and
at
his
heels
strode
the
lithe
pedro
and
the
quiet
lourenço
they
ran
their
eyes
over
the
group
then
stood
looking
inquiringly
at
their
employer
be
seated
men
roll
cigarettes
if
you
like
said
the
coronel
coolly
they
did
both
pedro
catching
tim
friendly
grin
flashed
a
quick
smile
in
return
lourenço
unsmiling
looked
squarely
into
each
face
in
turn
and
seemed
satisfied
with
what
he
saw
both
then
glanced
around
as
if
missing
some
one
your
friend
josé
has
left
us
the
coronel
informed
them
dryly
interpreting
the
look
he
disappeared
in
the
night
ah
that
is
why
one
of
our
canoes
is
gone
said
pedro
we
are
ready
to
start
you
mistake
the
old
gentleman
laughed
we
do
not
want
him
back
nothing
else
is
missing
whereat
pedro
looked
slightly
surprised
lourenço
lips
curved
in
a
faint
grin
neither
made
any
further
comment
the
coronel
plunged
at
once
into
the
business
for
which
they
had
been
summoned
succinctly
he
stated
the
purpose
of
the
north
americans
in
coming
here
pointed
out
their
need
of
guides
and
stopped
there
he
said
nothing
of
the
dangers
ahead
mentioned
no
reward
did
not
even
ask
the
men
whether
they
would
go
he
merely
lit
a
fresh
cigar
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
a
silence
followed
again
lourenço
looked
searchingly
into
the
face
of
each
american
pedro
contemplated
the
opposite
wall
taking
occasional
puffs
from
his
cigarette
at
length
knowlton
suggested
tentatively
we
will
pay
well
both
the
bushmen
frowned
the
coronel
spoke
in
a
tone
of
mild
reproof
senhor
it
is
not
a
matter
of
pay
these
men
can
make
plenty
of
money
as
pardon
said
knowlton
and
thereafter
held
his
tongue
deliberately
lourenço
finished
his
smoke
pinched
the
coal
between
a
hard
thumb
and
forefinger
and
spoke
for
the
first
time
may
i
ask
senhor
if
you
are
the
commander
his
gaze
rested
on
mckay
i
am
and
do
i
understand
that
we
shall
at
all
times
be
subject
to
your
orders
in
case
any
orders
are
necessary
yes
but
i
assume
that
you
will
not
need
commands
a
quiet
smile
showed
in
the
bushman
eyes
he
glanced
at
pedro
the
latter
met
the
look
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
without
wink
nod
or
other
sign
but
when
lourenço
turned
again
to
mckay
he
spoke
as
if
all
were
arranged
when
do
we
start
capitao
tim
slapped
his
leg
and
cackled
by
cripes
there
ai
no

motion
with
these
guys
hey
cap
mckay
smiled
approvingly
we
shall
get
on
together
he
said
lourenço
and
pedro
this
is
not
a
party
we
are
three
comrades
who
now
become
five
if
at
any
time
one
man
needs
to
command
i
as
senior
officer
will
take
that
command
otherwise
we
are
all
on
an
equal
footing
just
so
lourenço
agreed
if
it
were
otherwise
you
would
still
be
three
men
not
five
since
that
is
plain
let
me
say
frankly
that
your
big
canoe
had
best
stay
here
also
everything
you
do
not
need
in
the
bush
two
light
canoes
are
faster
easier
to
handle
and
to
hide
pedro
and
i
have
our
own
canoe
and
will
provide
our
own
supplies
we
will
pick
out
a
boat
for
you
and
load
it
with
what
you
select
from
your
equipment
after
that
every
man
swings
his
own
paddle
qual
por
si
e
deus
por
each
for
himself
and
god
for
us
all
pedro
summarized
that
the
dope
applauded
tim
now
say
renzo
old
feller
what
d
know
about
these
here
now
red
bones
up
above
here
and
have
ye
got
anything
on
that
raposy
guy
lourenço
shook
his
head
i
know
little
of
the
red
bone
people
for
i
have
never
met
them
that
is
one
reason
why
i
now
should
like
to
meet
them
i
have
heard
of
them
yes
and
the
things
i
have
heard
are
not
pleasant
yet
it
may
be
that
the
tales
are
worse
than
the
people
i
have
also
heard
terrible
stories
of
the
cannibals
the
mayorunas
yet
i
have
been
among
the
cannibals
and
found
them
not
so
bad
though
it
is
true
that
they
eat
the
flesh
of
their
enemies
i
have
seen
it
done
but
it
makes
a
very
great
difference
how
they
are
approached
and
who
the
men
are
who
approach
them
it
is
possible
that
we
may
go
unharmed
among
even
ossos
the
red
bones
we
shall
see
of
the
raposa
i
think
i
do
know
something
i
have
seen
him
everyone
except
pedro
sat
up
with
a
start
you
have
seen
him
exclaimed
the
coronel
when
where
how
why
have
you
not
spoken
of
it
because
coronel
i
forgot
it
until
now
it
meant
nothing
to
us
yes
pedro
was
with
me
except
that
it
was
one
more
queer
thing
in
the
bush
in
time
i
might
have
remembered
it
and
told
you
but
you
know
we
have
been
busy
true
but
go
on
it
was
only
a
little
time
ago
we
were
returning
from
the
scouting
trip
on
which
you
sent
us
to
locate
new
rubber
trees
we
were
seven
eight
seven
eight
days
journey
from
here
prompted
pedro
we
were
in
our
canoe
when
a
sudden
storm
broke
and
we
got
ashore
to
wait
until
it
was
over
the
place
was
on
an
a
creek
about
two
days
away
from
the
river
the
trees
were
large
and
the
ground
free
from
bush
in
a
flash
of
lightning
we
saw
a
man
peering
out
at
us
from
a
hollow
tree
he
was
naked
and
streaked
with
paint
that
was
all
we
saw
in
the
flashes
that
came
and
went
the
rain
was
heavy
and
we
stayed
where
we
were
until
it
ended
then
we
ordered
that
man
to
come
out
he
came
and
he
held
bow
and
arrow
ready
to
shoot
we
too
were
ready
to
shoot
but
we
held
back
our
bullets
and
he
held
back
his
arrow
we
saw
that
his
paint
was
red
and
that
it
traced
his
bones
that
his
skin
was
that
of
a
tanned
white
man
and
his
hair
was
dark
with
a
white
streak
over
one
ear
no
we
did
not
notice
the
color
of
his
eyes
the
light
was
not
good
and
he
stood
well
away
from
us
we
looked
around
for
other
men
but
saw
none
we
asked
him
who
he
was
and
what
he
wanted
but
he
gave
no
answer
he
looked
at
us
for
a
long
time
and
we
at
him
then
he
began
walking
away
sidewise
watching
us
steadily
holding
his
arrow
always
ready
finally
he
disappeared
among
the
trees
and
we
saw
him
no
more
but
we
heard
him
senhores
twice
before
we
lost
sight
of
him
he
spoke
out
in
a
queer
voice
like
that
of
a
parrot
and
the
thing
he
said
was
davey
mckay
thumped
a
fist
on
his
chair
davey
david
rand
perhaps
so
capitao
i
do
not
know
but
he
spoke
english
by
thunder
david
rand
merry
where
that
picture
knowlton
was
already
unbuttoning
his
pocket
flap
quickly
he
produced
the
photograph
that
the
fellow
lourenço
studied
the
face
the
eagerly
anticipated
affirmative
did
not
come
i
can
not
say
surely
this
is
a
man
with
hair
close
trimmed
that
one
face
was
gaunt
covered
partly
with
beard
and
partly
by
long
hair
and
we
were
not
close
to
him
as
i
have
said
i
would
not
say
the
two
were
the
same
until
i
could
have
a
better
look
at
the
wild
man
you
did
follow
him
no
why
should
we
he
had
done
nothing
to
us
and
we
let
him
go
his
way
we
did
look
at
his
hollow
tree
though
but
it
was
only
an
empty
tree
not
his
home
a
place
where
he
had
stepped
in
out
of
the
storm
we
had
other
things
to
do
so
we
got
into
our
canoe
again
and
paddled
off
you
can
find
the
place
again
yes
but
i
much
doubt
if
we
shall
find
him
there
never
mind
we
something
to
start
with
now
and
that
worth
a
lot
get
busy
with
your
boats
and
supplies
boys
right
away
tim
and
merry
let
dig
out
our
essentials
and
start
we
on
a
hot
trail
at
last
let
go
chapter
xi
out
of
the
air
again
the
sun
fought
the
mists
of
a
new
day
casting
a
pallid
watery
light
on
the
livid
green
roof
of
the
limitless
jungle
high
up
under
that
roof
more
than
a
hundred
feet
above
the
ground
the
morning
alarm
clock
went
off
with
a
scream
the
sudden
chorus
of
monkeys
and
macaws
awaking
after
a
few
hours
of
silence
down
on
the
eastern
shore
of
the
river
in
a
little
natural
port
where
the
shadows
still
lay
thick
men
stirred
under
their
black
mosquito
nets
yawned
and
waited
for
more
light
before
starting
another
day
journey
to
three
of
the
five
men
housed
under
those
flimsy
coverings
the
somber
hue
of
their
nets
was
new
on
leaving
remate
de
males
the
insect
bars
had
been
clean
white
and
though
they
had
grown
somewhat
soiled
from
daily
handling
they
never
had
approached
the
drab
dinginess
of
the
barriers
draping
the
hammocks
of
the
peruvian
rivermen
in
fact
their
owners
had
been
at
some
pains
to
keep
them
as
clean
as
possible
folding
them
each
morning
with
military
precision
and
stowing
them
carefully
wherefore
they
were
somewhat
taken
aback
when
informed
that
nice
white
nets
were
decidedly
not
the
thing
in
this
part
of
the
world
up
to
this
place
senhores
they
have
done
no
harm
pedro
said
before
leaving
the
coronel
grounds
but
from
here
on
they
will
not
do
at
all
the
weakest
moonlight
yes
even
starlight
would
make
them
stand
out
in
the
darkness
like
tombstones
a
few
days
more
and
we
shall
be
in
the
cannibal
country
and
it
is
an
old
trick
of
those
eaters
of
men
to
skulk
along
the
shore
by
night
watching
a
camp
until
all
are
asleep
and
then
sneak
up
with
spears
ready
a
rush
and
a
swift
stab
of
the
spears
into
those
white
nets
and
you
are
dead
or
dying
from
the
poisoned
points
i
would
no
more
sleep
under
a
white
net
than
i
would
lie
in
my
hammock
and
blow
a
horn
to
show
where
i
was
your
light
nets
must
stay
here
we
will
find
dark
ones
for
you
thus
the
voyagers
learned
another
of
those
little
things
on
which
sometimes
hinges
life
or
death
even
mckay
with
his
experience
of
other
jungles
had
never
thought
it
necessary
to
drape
himself
in
invisibility
at
night
but
when
his
attention
was
called
to
it
he
recognized
its
value
at
once
and
the
white
nets
were
forthwith
abandoned
now
on
the
first
morning
out
from
the
nunes
place
the
three
americans
stretched
themselves
in
lazy
enjoyment
after
a
night
passed
without
a
sentinel
the
stretching
evoked
sundry
grunts
due
to
the
discovery
that
their
muscles
still
were
lame
the
long
steamer
journey
from
their
own
land
followed
by
the
daily
confinement
of
the
peruvian
canoe
had
afforded
scant
opportunity
for
keeping
themselves
fit
and
the
sudden
necessity
for
doing
their
own
paddling
had
found
every
man
soft
but
they
now
were
hardening
fast
and
the
steady
swing
of
the
paddles
was
proving
a
physical
joy
these
were
men
ill
accustomed
to
sitting
in
enforced
idleness
for
weeks
on
end
matches
flared
under
the
nets
and
cigarette
smoke
drifted
into
the
air
rousing
to
fresh
activity
the
mosquitoes
humming
hungrily
outside
gradually
the
shadows
paled
and
the
weak
light
reflecting
from
the
water
beyond
grew
into
day
the
nets
lifted
and
the
bloodthirsty
insects
swooped
in
vicious
triumph
on
the
emerging
men
but
again
matches
blazed
flame
licked
up
among
kindlings
a
fire
grew
and
in
its
smoke
screen
the
voyagers
found
some
surcease
from
the
bug
hordes
soon
the
fragrance
of
coffee
floated
into
the
air
tim
yawned
coughed
explosively
and
swore
fellers
ca
even
take
a
gape
for
himself
without
gittin
these
cussed
bugs
down
his
throat
he
complained
and
coughed
again
gim
me
some
coffee
i
got
one
skeeter
the
size
of
a
devil
darnin
needle
stuck
in
me
windpipe
a
devil
darning
needle
what
is
that
senhor
tim
inquired
pedro
passing
him
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
when
the
liquid
and
the
skeeter
had
passed
into
tim
stomach
he
enlightened
the
inquirer
ye
dunno
what
a
devil
darnin
needle
gosh
i
at
ye
i
seen
lots
of
right
on
this
here
river
he
a
bug
about
so
long
he
stuck
out
a
finger
and
he
got
jaws
like
a
crab
and
a
long
limber
tail
a
with
needle
in
the
end
and
inside
him
is
a
roll
o
tough
silk
tough
as
spider
web
and
he
death
on
liars
any
time
a
feller
tells
a
lie
he
got
to
look
out
or
all
to
oncet
one
o
them
come
scootin
at
him
and
grab
him
by
the
nose
with
them
jaws
then
curl
up
his
tail
the
bug
i
mean
and
run
his
needle
and
thread
right
through
the
feller
lips
and
sew
his
mouth
up
tight
then
he
flies
off
lookin
for
another
liar
deus
and
the
liar
starves
to
death
wal
no
o
course
he
can
git
somebody
to
cut
the
stitches
but
the
needle
is
a
good
thick
one
and
it
leaves
a
row
o
holes
all
along
the
feller
lips
any
time
ye
see
a
guy
with
round
scars
around
his
mouth
pedro
ye
know
he
such
an
awful
liar
the
devil
bug
got
him
mckay
coughed
knowlton
blew
his
nose
into
a
big
handkerchief
lourenço
squinted
sidewise
at
tim
who
was
solemn
as
an
owl
pedro
his
eyes
twinkling
bent
forward
and
scrutinized
tim
mouth
you
have
been
fortunate
senhor
he
said
simply
and
stepped
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
fire
huh
say
lookit
here
ye
gorilla
knowlton
exploded
mckay
and
lourenço
snickered
it
on
you
tim
vociferated
knowlton
you
dug
the
hole
yourself
now
crawl
in
and
pull
it
in
after
you
tim
snorted
wrathfully
but
his
eyes
laughed
aw
what
the
use
o
trying
to
educate
you
guys
you
swallowed
a
mosquito
just
now
but
i
can
not
swallow
that
devil
bug
pedro
grinned
tim
rumbled
something
solaced
himself
with
a
cigarette
then
squatted
and
joined
the
others
in
their
frugal
breakfast
of
coffee
and
a
handful
of
farinha
mixed
with
water
in
a
gourd
when
it
was
finished
mckay
who
never
smoked
in
the
morning
until
he
had
eaten
filled
a
pipe
and
suggested
guess
we
better
plan
our
campaign
we
did
take
time
yesterday
in
case
we
find
no
trace
of
the
raposa
at
the
place
where
you
fellows
saw
him
what
your
idea
lourenço
puffing
thoughtfully
stared
into
the
fire
there
will
be
time
enough
to
decide
that
capitao
after
we
have
visited
that
place
he
said
slowly
still
perhaps
it
is
best
to
make
some
plan
it
can
be
changed
at
any
time
for
a
moment
longer
he
looked
at
the
dying
flame
then
dropping
his
cigarette
stub
into
it
he
continued
if
i
were
going
alone
to
find
a
man
among
the
red
bones
i
should
go
first
to
the
mayorunas
and
work
through
them
to
make
sure
of
a
friendly
reception
by
the
other
people
i
would
why
that
the
very
thing
schwandorf
suggested
yes
i
have
not
heard
what
he
said
tell
me
mckay
did
so
lourenço
smiled
sometimes
capitao
the
devil
puts
into
the
hands
of
men
a
weapon
which
is
turned
against
himself
so
it
is
now
that
schwandorf
never
expected
you
to
reach
the
people
you
seek
but
the
plan
is
good
it
would
not
be
good
if
you
followed
it
exactly
as
he
laid
it
out
but
things
have
changed
and
what
you
could
not
do
with
peruvian
companions
or
alone
you
perhaps
can
do
with
us
i
will
show
you
it
happens
that
i
have
been
twice
among
the
cannibals
living
in
a
certain
which
i
can
find
again
perhaps
you
know
that
those
people
live
in
scattered
each
ruled
by
its
own
chief
yes
we
know
about
that
good
now
if
we
went
to
any
where
we
were
not
known
we
might
be
killed
at
once
but
at
that
of
which
i
speak
i
am
known
to
the
chief
and
all
his
fighting
men
for
i
once
led
them
on
a
raid
into
peru
so
they
will
remember
me
what
that
knowlton
interrupted
in
amazement
you
led
a
cannibal
tribe
on
the
warpath
just
so
senhor
it
is
a
long
story
but
these
are
the
facts
there
was
in
peru
a
gang
of
killers
robbers
and
worse
who
called
themselves
the
peccaries
they
raided
one
of
the
coronel
camps
where
i
was
in
charge
killed
all
my
gang
except
myself
and
one
other
and
used
us
two
as
slaves
and
beasts
of
burden
the
other
man
died
from
poison
i
lived
only
to
revenge
myself
on
those
foul
outlaws
there
was
much
rubber
of
the
coronel
worth
much
money
at
that
time
in
the
camp
they
had
raided
so
after
driving
me
like
a
beast
to
their
stronghold
in
the
hills
of
peru
they
came
back
with
boats
and
indian
porters
to
get
out
that
rubber
on
that
return
journey
i
tried
to
kill
the
leader
who
was
called
el
amarillo
i
failed
and
he
had
me
nailed
with
long
thorns
to
a
tree
where
i
might
hang
in
torment
for
days
dying
slowly
see
here
are
the
marks
all
three
of
the
americans
had
noticed
on
the
previous
day
that
each
of
lourenço
hands
was
disfigured
by
a
scar
which
looked
as
if
a
spike
had
been
driven
through
now
he
held
those
hands
forward
for
their
inspection
then
he
pulled
off
his
loose
shirt
and
rolled
up
his
trousers
they
saw
other
scars
in
the
big
muscles
before
the
armpits
in
the
soft
flesh
under
the
ribs
in
the
thighs
and
calves
the
dirty
hun
tim
grated
that
was
not
all
senhor
tim
they
also
put
fire
ants
on
me
which
bit
so
cruelly
that
i
nearly
lost
my
mind
from
pain
then
they
went
on
intending
to
have
more
sport
with
me
when
they
came
back
with
the
rubber
but
after
they
left
me
two
hunters
of
the
cannibal
tribe
who
had
been
following
a
tapir
track
found
me
and
took
me
down
from
the
tree
now
the
peccaries
before
this
had
stolen
some
women
from
a
mayoruna
and
were
treating
them
like
dogs
i
saw
one
of
those
women
brutally
murdered
while
i
was
captive
in
the
outlaw
camp
i
managed
to
tell
the
two
hunters
i
could
lead
them
to
the
peccary
stronghold
and
give
them
revenge
they
carried
me
to
their
i
could
not
walk
and
told
their
chief
what
i
had
said
the
chief
caused
my
hurts
to
be
cured
and
then
i
kept
my
promise
i
guided
the
savages
to
the
outlaw
camp
they
surrounded
it
and
in
the
fight
that
followed
every
peccary
was
killed
except
their
leader
now
that
cannibal
chief
has
not
forgotten
me
wait
a
minute
protested
knowlton
did
that
peccary
leader
escape
no
he
was
kept
alive
until
a
big
herd
of
peccaries
was
met
then
because
he
called
himself
of
the
peccaries
he
was
nailed
to
a
tree
as
i
had
been
and
told
to
make
the
peccaries
take
out
the
thorns
the
wild
pigs
tore
him
into
ribbons
with
their
tusks
calmly
he
donned
his
shirt
again
tim
staring
at
him
twitched
his
shoulders
as
if
a
chill
had
gone
down
his
back
ugh
muttered
knowlton
so
now
lourenço
resumed
if
i
can
find
that
chief
again
he
may
have
been
killed
in
some
tribal
fight
before
now
he
may
be
friendly
to
all
of
us
or
he
may
not
savages
can
not
be
relied
on
with
much
certainty
but
if
any
of
the
mayorunas
will
help
us
he
will
it
is
worth
trying
and
if
he
is
not
friendly
knowlton
paused
we
do
not
come
back
pedro
finished
have
you
a
better
plan
all
shook
their
heads
laurenco
idea
is
excellent
said
mckay
i
was
thinking
along
the
same
line
though
i
did
not
know
he
had
any
such
friendly
relations
with
a
chief
that
makes
it
all
the
more
advisable
to
try
it
unless
we
find
the
raposa
first
we
of
course
will
not
land
at
the
place
where
schwandorf
told
us
to
go
ashore
seven
days
from
here
by
no
means
lourenço
concurred
in
five
days
we
leave
the
river
and
travel
along
the
if
we
go
to
the
it
will
be
from
another
direction
than
the
river
he
began
preparing
to
travel
the
others
also
went
about
the
work
of
breaking
camp
by
the
time
the
canoes
were
loaded
the
mists
had
lifted
and
the
river
lay
open
and
empty
before
them
in
the
bush
around
and
beyond
gloom
still
lay
thick
and
the
forest
life
yelped
howled
clattered
and
wailed
but
out
on
the
water
it
was
broad
day
and
far
overhead
sounded
the
harsh
cries
of
unseen
parrots
flying
two
by
two
in
the
sunlight
above
the
matted
branches
the
world
of
the
pathless
tropic
wilderness
ever
dying
ever
living
was
about
its
daily
business
the
five
invaders
were
about
theirs
as
the
paddlers
dipped
however
knowlton
held
back
say
rod
we
did
tell
these
fellows
about
schwandorf
indian
hold
up
a
second
men
while
all
rested
on
their
paddles
he
spoke
of
the
mysterious
messenger
dispatched
from
nazareth
pedro
and
lourenço
contemplated
the
river
then
frowned
that
may
be
of
importance
senhores
said
lourenço
it
may
change
everything
for
us
we
saw
a
lone
indian
go
past
the
coronel
place
traveling
fast
three
days
before
you
came
i
would
give
much
to
know
where
he
is
now
and
what
word
he
carries
a
short
man
with
a
bad
left
leg
you
say
we
shall
keep
watch
for
such
a
man
perhaps
we
may
meet
him
wherein
he
predicted
more
accurately
than
he
knew
the
canoes
swung
out
and
the
paddlers
settled
into
the
steady
stroke
to
which
they
were
growing
accustomed
hour
after
hour
they
forged
on
the
brazilians
adjusting
their
speed
to
that
of
the
americans
who
had
not
yet
attained
the
muscular
ease
of
habitual
canoemen
the
miles
flowed
slowly
but
surely
behind
them
the
sun
rolled
higher
and
hotter
the
silence
of
approaching
noon
crept
over
the
jungle
on
either
side
then
as
the
time
drew
near
when
they
would
land
for
a
more
hearty
meal
than
that
of
the
morning
pedro
pointed
ahead
up
out
of
the
bush
on
the
peruvian
shore
rose
a
vulture
it
flapped
sullenly
away
as
if
disappointed
the
bushmen
quick
to
note
anything
that
might
be
a
sign
paid
no
attention
to
the
bird
flight
but
marked
with
unerring
eye
the
spot
whence
it
had
taken
wing
let
us
cross
comrades
and
see
what
we
may
see
pedro
called
if
nothing
is
there
we
can
eat
but
something
was
there
all
saw
it
before
they
landed
the
stern
of
a
small
speedy
canoe
almost
concealed
in
a
narrow
rift
at
the
bottom
of
the
bank
in
the
soil
of
the
rising
slope
were
the
prints
of
bare
feet
and
pedro
scanning
the
tracks
narrowly
after
he
and
the
others
reached
shore
asserted
these
were
not
made
up
the
bank
they
climbed
silent
and
watchful
at
the
top
lourenço
took
the
lead
in
under
big
trees
the
five
passed
in
file
a
short
distance
from
the
edge
lourenço
stopped
looking
at
the
ground
the
others
spread
out
and
stared
at
the
thing
he
had
found
between
the
buttress
roots
of
a
tall
tree
was
a
crude
shelter
of
palm
leaves
before
this
lay
the
scattered
bones
of
a
man
the
skull
had
been
crushed
by
a
mighty
blow
the
bones
were
picked
clean
had
been
stripped
and
torn
asunder
days
before
and
the
vulture
which
had
just
left
had
gotten
nothing
for
its
belated
visit
among
them
were
remnants
of
cloth
a
belt
and
a
machete
and
strands
of
coarse
black
hair
a
few
feet
away
lay
a
cheap
trade
gun
lourenço
inspected
the
weapon
and
laid
it
back
did
he
shoot
before
he
was
downed
asked
knowlton
no
the
gun
is
loaded
his
death
came
from
above
the
bushman
ran
his
eye
up
the
towering
tree
then
pointed
to
a
large
dark
object
on
the
ground
near
by
castanha
tree
he
explained
that
heavy
nut
fell
and
smashed
the
indian
skull
like
an
egg
indian
yes
his
gun
his
shelter
and
his
hair
show
that
and
stooping
and
pointing
at
one
of
the
bones
that
bone
shows
who
he
was
see
capitao
mckay
looked
down
on
a
leg
bone
at
some
time
the
leg
had
been
broken
and
badly
set
if
set
at
all
the
bone
was
crooked
a
short
indian
with
a
crooked
leg
schwandorf
messenger
no
man
will
ever
receive
the
message
he
bore
he
camped
here
days
ago
now
he
camps
here
forever
chapter
xii
the
arrow
slowly
silently
two
canoes
glided
along
the
still
dark
water
of
a
gloomy
creek
by
the
interlaced
limbs
of
lofty
trees
the
first
propelled
by
the
blades
of
two
brazilian
bushmen
seemed
to
be
seeking
something
for
it
nosed
along
with
frequent
pauses
of
the
paddles
during
which
it
drifted
almost
to
a
stop
while
its
crew
searched
the
solemn
jungle
depths
reaching
away
from
the
shore
the
second
carrying
three
bronzed
and
bearded
men
of
another
continent
was
only
trailing
the
leader
it
moved
and
paused
like
the
first
but
the
recurrent
scrutiny
of
the
farther
gloom
by
its
paddlers
was
that
of
men
who
saw
only
a
meaningless
monotonous
bulk
of
buttresses
and
trunks
and
tangle
of
looping
lianas
in
this
dimness
and
bewildering
chaos
the
trio
might
as
well
have
been
blind
the
eyes
of
the
tiny
fleet
were
in
the
first
boat
the
progress
of
the
dugouts
was
almost
stealthy
not
a
paddle
thumped
or
splashed
not
a
voice
spoke
they
moved
with
the
alert
caution
born
not
of
fear
but
of
wary
readiness
for
any
sudden
event
like
prowling
jungle
creatures
which
themselves
seeking
quarry
must
be
ever
on
guard
lest
they
become
the
hunted
instead
of
the
hunters
for
the
past
two
days
they
had
moved
thus
the
last
fresh
meat
had
been
shot
miles
down
the
river
where
a
bullet
from
the
rifle
of
mckay
had
downed
a
fat
swamp
deer
since
that
day
not
a
gun
had
been
fired
the
rations
now
were
tough
jerked
beef
and
monkey
meat
slabs
of
salt
pirarucu
fish
and
farinha
varied
by
tinned
delicacies
from
the
stores
of
the
americans
henceforth
gunfire
was
taboo
unless
it
should
become
necessary
in
at
length
the
fore
canoe
halted
with
an
abruptness
that
told
of
back
strokes
of
the
blades
hidden
under
water
mckay
bowman
of
the
trailing
craft
also
backed
water
while
his
mates
held
their
paddles
rigid
the
two
boats
drifted
together
this
is
the
place
lourenço
said
speaking
low
the
americans
scanning
the
shore
saw
nothing
to
differentiate
the
spot
from
the
rest
of
the
wilderness
growth
yet
lourenço
tone
was
sure
pedro
face
also
showed
recognition
of
his
surroundings
with
no
apparent
motion
of
the
paddles
though
the
wrists
of
the
paddlers
moved
almost
imperceptibly
the
canoe
of
the
bushmen
floated
to
the
bank
they
picked
up
their
rifles
twitched
their
bow
up
on
land
and
turned
their
faces
to
the
forest
stay
here
was
pedro
subdued
command
until
you
hear
the
which
we
taught
you
down
the
river
he
and
lourenço
faded
into
the
dimness
and
were
gone
beats
me
how
them
guys
find
their
way
muttered
tim
i
could
land
here
twenty
times
but
if
i
went
away
and
then
come
back
i
never
know
the
place
it
all
in
the
feel
of
it
was
mckay
explanation
they
find
places
and
travel
the
bush
as
an
indian
does
by
a
sixth
sense
take
them
to
new
york
city
guide
them
around
then
turn
them
loose
and
they
be
hopelessly
lost
in
ten
minutes
the
others
nodded
agreement
and
sat
watching
in
the
shadows
no
creature
moved
afar
off
some
bird
cried
mournfully
like
a
lost
soul
condemned
to
wander
forever
alone
in
the
grim
green
solitudes
no
other
sound
came
to
the
listeners
save
the
hum
of
the
big
forest
mosquitoes
to
which
they
now
had
become
indifferent
for
all
they
could
see
or
hear
of
their
two
guides
they
might
as
well
have
been
alone
yet
they
knew
the
brazilians
were
not
far
away
threading
the
maze
with
sure
step
and
scouting
for
any
sign
of
danger
at
length
a
long
soft
whistle
sounded
in
the
bush
ahead
any
indian
hunter
hearing
that
sound
would
straightway
have
begun
scanning
the
high
branches
for
the
liquid
call
was
that
of
the
mutum
or
curassow
turkey
but
the
waiting
trio
knew
it
for
pedro
signal
that
all
was
clear
at
once
they
slid
their
canoe
to
shore
lifted
its
bow
to
a
firm
grip
on
the
clay
and
after
plumbing
the
shadows
quietly
advanced
in
squad
column
a
few
steps
and
they
halted
suddenly
and
whirled
a
voice
had
spoken
just
behind
them
there
squatting
leisurely
between
the
root
buttresses
of
a
huge
tree
lourenço
looked
up
at
them
in
amusement
they
had
passed
within
rifle
length
of
him
without
seeing
him
of
what
use
are
your
eyes
comrades
he
chaffed
in
the
bush
one
should
see
in
all
directions
at
once
you
were
looking
at
that
patch
of
sunlight
just
ahead
yes
but
danger
lurks
in
the
shadows
not
in
the
glaring
light
without
awaiting
an
answer
he
arose
and
took
the
lead
at
the
edge
of
the
small
sunlit
space
beyond
he
halted
you
were
heading
for
the
right
place
he
added
then
look
around
do
you
see
anything
swiftly
they
scrutinized
the
gap
left
by
the
fall
of
a
great
tree
whose
gigantic
trunk
had
bludgeoned
weaker
trees
away
in
its
crushing
descent
seeing
nothing
unusual
they
then
peered
around
them
tim
suddenly
snapped
up
his
rifle
holler
tree
there
and
a
man
in
it
hey
come
out
o
there
your
eyes
improve
lourenço
complimented
but
the
man
is
pedro
tim
lowered
the
gun
as
pedro
grinning
came
out
of
his
concealment
that
is
the
tree
of
the
raposa
lourenço
went
on
the
lightning
flashing
in
from
above
showed
us
the
man
but
now
senhores
i
think
we
must
tramp
the
bush
for
some
time
before
we
find
that
raposa
again
there
is
no
trace
of
him
here
hm
said
knowlton
striding
to
the
hollow
tree
he
peered
about
inside
it
the
cavity
was
almost
big
enough
to
sling
a
hammock
in
but
it
was
empty
of
any
indication
of
habitation
human
or
otherwise
a
temporary
refuge
that
was
all
no
sign
anywhere
around
here
eh
queried
mckay
we
have
found
none
we
shall
look
farther
but
i
have
small
hope
if
you
senhores
will
make
the
camp
this
time
we
shall
start
at
once
and
stay
out
until
dark
build
no
fire
until
we
return
and
if
you
hear
the
call
of
the
mutum
pay
no
attention
to
it
we
may
use
it
to
locate
each
other
if
we
separate
and
also
perhaps
as
a
decoy
any
wild
man
red
or
white
hearing
that
call
would
seek
the
bird
making
it
for
a
fine
fat
mutum
is
well
worth
killing
keep
quiet
and
be
on
guard
right
go
ahead
the
bushmen
turned
at
once
and
stole
away
the
others
returned
to
the
canoes
transported
the
necessary
duffle
to
the
base
of
the
hollow
tree
made
camp
with
a
few
poles
and
squatted
against
the
trunk
to
smoke
watch
and
wait
several
times
they
heard
mutum
calls
receding
in
the
distance
then
came
silence
the
shadows
in
the
gap
crawled
steadily
eastward
knowlton
tested
the
feed
of
his
automatic
which
since
its
balkiness
in
the
fight
with
the
peruvians
he
had
kept
carefully
oiled
and
free
from
the
slightest
speck
of
rust
tim
arose
at
intervals
and
paced
up
and
down
in
sentry
go
eyes
and
ears
alert
a
useless
activity
but
one
which
provided
an
outlet
for
his
restless
energy
mckay
let
his
gaze
rove
over
the
small
area
visible
from
their
post
studying
the
contours
of
the
towering
trunks
the
prone
giant
whose
fall
had
opened
the
hole
in
the
leafy
roof
the
parasitical
vines
twined
about
other
trees
the
thin
outflung
buttresses
supporting
the
mighty
columns
all
familiar
sights
to
him
but
the
only
things
to
occupy
his
vision
so
limned
on
his
brain
did
the
scene
become
that
after
a
time
he
could
close
his
eyes
and
see
it
in
every
important
detail
it
might
have
been
two
hours
after
pedro
and
lourenço
had
departed
the
shadows
had
grown
much
longer
when
over
mckay
stole
the
feeling
that
he
was
being
watched
he
glanced
at
his
companions
and
found
that
neither
of
them
was
looking
at
him
knowlton
sitting
with
hands
clasped
around
updrawn
knees
was
dozing
tim
though
wide
awake
was
staring
absently
at
a
fungus
the
captain
eyes
searched
the
short
vistas
all
about
spying
nothing
new
still
the
feeling
persisted
then
all
at
once
his
roaming
gaze
stopped
became
fixed
on
a
point
some
forty
feet
away
there
rose
a
tree
and
from
it
near
the
ground
projected
a
blackish
bole
mckay
was
very
sure
the
protuberance
had
not
been
there
before
he
had
stared
steadily
at
that
tree
more
than
once
and
its
shape
was
quite
clear
in
his
mind
was
that
bump
an
insensate
wood
growth
now
revealed
for
the
first
time
by
the
changing
sun
slant
or
for
minutes
he
watched
it
it
did
not
move
then
tim
restless
again
rose
directly
in
mckay
line
of
sight
yawned
silently
swung
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
and
began
another
slow
parade
of
his
post
when
he
had
stepped
aside
mckay
looked
again
for
the
puzzling
bole
it
was
gone
with
a
bound
the
captain
was
up
and
dashing
toward
the
tree
drawing
his
pistol
as
he
ran
but
within
three
strides
he
went
down
a
tough
vine
unnoticed
on
the
ground
looped
snakily
around
one
ankle
and
threw
him
hard
his
gun
flew
from
his
hand
as
he
fell
a
tiny
whispering
sound
flitted
past
followed
by
a
small
blow
somewhere
behind
him
ensued
a
gruff
grunt
from
tim
and
the
swift
clatter
of
a
breech
bolt
raging
mckay
kicked
his
foot
loose
and
heaved
himself
up
empty
handed
he
continued
his
rush
for
the
tree
but
when
he
reached
it
he
found
nothing
behind
it
if
anything
had
been
there
it
now
was
gone
and
the
vacant
shadows
beyond
were
as
inscrutable
as
ever
feet
padded
behind
him
and
tim
and
knowlton
halted
on
either
side
a
moment
of
silent
searching
and
tim
broke
into
reproach
cap
do
never
do
that
again
if
ye
take
a
tumble
in
my
line
o
fire
for
the
love
o
mike
stay
down
till
i
shoot
i
come
so
near
drillin
ye
when
ye
hopped
up
that
i
sweatin
blood
right
now
in
truth
the
veteran
was
pale
around
the
mouth
and
his
broad
face
was
beaded
with
cold
drops
i
seen
more
one
time
in
france
when
i
felt
like
shootin
my
officer
but
i
never
come
so
near
doin
it
as
jest
now
i
had
finger
to
trigger
and
had
took
up
the
slack
and
a
hair
weight
more
pull
would
have
spattered
yer
head
all
around
and
besides
givin
me
heart
failure
ye
let
that
guy
git
away
we
never
find
him
you
saw
him
mckay
cut
in
i
seen
somethin
beyond
ye
could
make
out
what
was
but
from
the
way
ye
was
goin
over
the
top
i
knowed
it
must
be
a
man
and
then
when
the
arrer
come
arrow
sure
missed
ye
when
ye
took
that
flop
and
stuck
in
the
tree
over
yonder
what
ye
rush
the
guy
for
anyways
why
ye
drill
him
from
where
ye
was
in
the
reaction
from
his
sudden
fright
tim
was
as
wrathfully
ready
to
bawl
out
his
captain
as
if
he
were
some
raw
rookie
mckay
with
a
cool
smile
explained
his
abrupt
action
meanwhile
reconnoitering
the
dimness
for
any
further
sign
of
the
vanished
assailant
none
showed
while
tim
stood
vigilant
guard
the
other
two
stooped
and
moved
around
the
base
of
the
tree
narrowly
examining
the
ground
beyond
it
they
paused
at
one
spot
fingered
the
soil
lightly
and
lit
a
match
or
two
no
ghost
said
knowlton
barefoot
man
did
leave
much
trace
but
enough
to
show
he
was
here
let
look
at
that
arrow
back
to
the
hollow
tree
they
went
retrieving
mckay
pistol
on
the
way
about
a
yard
above
the
earth
a
long
shaft
projected
from
the
bark
knowlton
reached
for
it
but
mckay
held
him
back
and
drew
it
out
thought
so
he
muttered
poisoned
oof
nice
gentle
sort
of
a
cuss
rumbled
tim
that
smear
on
the
point
is
that
poison
poison
quickest
and
deadliest
kind
of
poison
mixes
instantly
with
blood
paralysis
convulsions
death
the
least
scratch
and
you
gone
wicked
head
on
this
thing
too
looks
like
a
piece
of
serrated
bone
see
all
those
little
barbs
along
the
edges
war
arrow
all
right
meanin
that
we
be
jumped
pretty
soon
by
more
injuns
if
that
on
the
warpath
he
ai
alone
would
be
a
bad
idea
to
take
cover
nodded
mckay
turning
the
shaft
downward
he
plunged
its
head
into
the
soft
ground
and
left
it
sticking
there
harmless
tim
go
down
and
guard
the
canoes
merry
lie
in
between
these
roots
and
keep
watch
off
that
way
i
go
over
to
that
tree
where
the
spy
hid
for
another
hour
the
camp
was
silent
each
in
his
covert
finger
on
trigger
the
trio
watched
with
ceaseless
vigilance
expecting
each
instant
to
detect
dusky
forms
crawling
up
from
tree
to
tree
yet
nothing
of
the
sort
came
nor
did
any
hostile
sound
reach
them
somewhere
parrots
squawked
somewhere
else
the
puppylike
yapping
of
toucans
disturbed
the
solitude
nothing
else
the
wan
light
faded
the
sun
crawled
up
the
trees
leaving
all
the
ground
in
shadow
then
not
far
off
sounded
the
soft
whistle
of
the
mutum
suspicious
the
watchers
held
their
places
until
with
another
whistle
pedro
came
into
view
followed
by
lourenço
mckay
arose
met
them
and
briefly
explained
the
situation
they
nodded
but
seemed
undisturbed
we
can
start
a
fire
now
capitao
lourenço
said
night
comes
and
we
are
hungry
there
will
be
no
danger
before
another
dawn
with
which
he
leaned
his
rifle
against
a
tree
and
started
immediate
preparations
for
a
meal
pedro
continued
on
to
the
canoes
made
sure
they
were
drawn
up
high
enough
to
remain
in
place
in
case
of
any
sudden
rain
and
returned
with
tim
around
them
now
resounded
the
swiftly
rising
roar
of
the
nightly
outbreak
of
animal
life
the
sun
vanished
at
once
blackness
whelmed
all
except
the
little
fire
see
anything
while
you
were
out
asked
mckay
we
found
no
trace
of
the
raposa
lourenço
evaded
what
do
you
plan
to
do
now
eat
smoke
talk
sleep
mckay
eyed
the
bushman
keenly
feeling
that
he
was
holding
something
back
but
feeling
also
that
this
pair
knew
what
they
were
about
he
bided
his
time
when
all
had
eaten
and
tobacco
smoke
was
blending
with
that
of
the
burning
wood
lourenço
drew
the
arrow
from
the
ground
and
studied
it
then
he
passed
it
to
pedro
who
after
a
critical
examination
held
it
in
the
blaze
until
the
deadly
head
was
burned
away
a
arrow
of
the
cannibal
mayorunas
said
lourenço
the
point
with
its
sawtooth
barbs
is
made
from
the
tail
bone
of
the
araya
the
flat
devilfish
of
the
swamp
lakes
that
fish
as
you
perhaps
know
has
a
whiplike
tail
armed
with
that
bone
and
if
he
strikes
the
bone
into
your
flesh
it
breaks
off
and
stays
in
the
wound
and
you
are
likely
to
die
but
in
that
case
death
comes
from
gangrene
mckay
remarked
this
point
has
been
dipped
in
wurali
poison
you
have
seen
such
arrows
before
capitao
seen
the
poison
before
yes
over
in
british
guiana
the
macusi
indians
make
it
from
the
wurali
vine
some
bitter
root
or
other
a
couple
of
bulbous
plants
two
kinds
of
ants
one
big
and
black
with
a
venomous
bite
the
other
small
and
red
a
lot
of
pepper
and
the
pounded
fangs
of
labarri
and
couanacouchi
snakes
they
boil
all
this
stuff
down
to
a
thick
syrup
and
that
the
poison
the
man
who
makes
it
is
sick
for
days
afterward
our
cannibals
make
that
poison
in
much
the
same
way
yet
guiana
is
many
hundreds
of
miles
from
here
and
our
indians
know
nothing
of
those
macusi
people
queer
is
it
not
that
the
same
plan
should
be
used
by
savages
thousands
of
miles
apart
rather
odd
must
have
started
from
some
common
source
hundreds
of
years
ago
and
spread
around
queerest
thing
is
though
that
a
poison
so
deadly
does
spoil
meat
for
eating
huh
exclaimed
tim
mean
to
say
them
cannibals
can
kill
us
by
scratchin
us
with
a
poison
arrer
and
then
stummick
us
afterwards
exactly
you
taste
just
as
sweet
as
ever
tim
maybe
more
so
cheer
up
they
say
it
does
hurt
much
to
die
that
way
you
paralyzed
so
quick
you
just
sort
of
fade
out
tim
shook
his
head
his
abhorrence
of
poison
strong
as
ever
knowlton
spoke
i
heard
that
this
wurali
poison
is
much
overrated
that
it
will
kill
only
birds
and
monkeys
not
men
deus
whoever
said
that
was
a
fool
trying
to
appear
wise
pedro
snorted
we
have
seen
the
poison
death
and
we
know
mckay
also
shook
his
head
experiments
have
been
made
with
the
wurali
of
the
macusis
he
stated
it
was
tried
on
a
hog
a
sloth
and
a
sloth
is
mighty
hard
to
kill
also
on
mules
and
on
a
ox
weighing
almost
half
a
ton
it
killed
every
one
of
them
a
momentary
silence
followed
tim
gazed
sourly
at
the
arrow
now
harmless
but
still
sinister
urrrgh
he
growled
cap
ye
had
a
narrer
squeak
come
near
gittin
it
from
in
front
and
behind
too
wisht
i
could
have
drilled
that
guy
the
bushmen
grinned
and
lourenço
next
speech
was
amazing
be
thankful
you
did
not
that
bullet
might
have
killed
us
all
after
enjoying
their
puzzled
expressions
a
moment
he
continued
we
are
nearer
to
a
mayoruna
than
i
thought
not
the
one
i
intended
to
seek
but
a
smaller
one
it
is
about
three
days
journey
from
here
and
to
reach
it
we
must
go
through
the
bush
the
man
who
left
this
arrow
here
is
from
that
a
week
ago
his
brother
went
hunting
and
he
has
not
returned
so
this
young
savage
and
three
of
his
comrades
now
are
searching
the
bush
for
some
sign
of
him
they
separated
each
going
in
a
different
direction
agreeing
to
meet
again
at
a
place
less
than
half
a
day
journey
from
here
this
man
circled
around
and
worked
along
this
creek
knowing
his
brother
would
hardly
go
beyond
the
water
he
spied
our
canoes
then
sought
the
men
who
had
come
in
them
and
found
you
he
watched
you
for
some
time
and
if
you
had
not
rushed
at
him
he
would
have
slipped
away
without
attacking
you
for
he
was
alone
and
he
saw
your
guns
but
when
you
capitao
suddenly
leaped
at
him
he
darted
away
then
stopped
long
enough
to
send
an
arrow
at
you
after
that
he
dodged
out
of
sight
and
ran
to
the
camp
of
his
three
friends
he
is
there
now
telling
about
you
great
guns
you
chaps
are
wizards
cried
knowlton
how
do
you
know
all
this
because
we
met
him
while
on
our
way
back
here
he
was
running
hard
and
we
heard
him
so
we
blocked
him
after
we
convinced
him
that
we
were
friendly
we
talked
for
some
time
i
can
speak
their
tongue
and
he
told
us
about
you
he
was
sure
you
were
enemies
to
him
and
his
people
and
believed
also
you
had
killed
his
missing
brother
and
he
was
going
first
to
rejoin
his
companions
and
then
hasten
to
the
to
bring
all
their
fighters
against
you
it
was
well
that
we
met
him
in
time
it
was
well
too
that
you
did
not
shoot
him
or
even
shoot
at
him
his
companions
would
have
learned
of
it
and
then
death
for
us
all
and
now
what
now
comrades
we
all
go
to
the
of
that
man
we
meet
him
and
the
other
three
at
the
place
where
we
talked
to
him
i
told
him
we
were
going
to
visit
that
other
chief
whom
i
knew
and
though
he
was
at
first
suspicious
of
a
trap
he
finally
agreed
to
lead
us
to
his
own
chief
so
in
the
morning
we
march
now
let
us
sleep
knowlton
and
mckay
glanced
at
each
other
and
nodded
luck
with
us
so
far
said
the
captain
right
we
just
march
right
into
jungle
town
with
bodyguard
and
everything
pretty
soft
wonder
if
they
turn
out
the
tomtom
band
to
drum
us
in
tim
said
nothing
he
squinted
again
at
the
headless
arrow
then
inspected
the
breech
bolt
of
his
rifle
chapter
xiii
the
way
of
the
jungle
dawn
came
dismal
damp
and
chill
moisture
dripped
drearily
from
the
upper
reaches
and
under
the
dense
canopy
of
leaves
and
limbs
the
gloom
and
the
fog
together
made
a
murk
wherein
the
bushmen
were
scarcely
visible
to
the
north
americans
ten
feet
away
yet
day
had
come
or
was
coming
the
noise
of
the
animal
world
left
little
doubt
of
that
by
the
light
of
a
sullen
smoky
fire
and
torches
pedro
and
lourenço
made
up
their
packs
cording
them
roughly
with
strips
brought
from
headquarters
the
americans
after
eating
a
more
solid
meal
than
the
brazilians
seemed
to
require
also
rolled
their
blankets
hammocks
nets
and
other
paraphernalia
strapped
the
outfits
into
the
army
pack
harnesses
which
they
had
transported
for
thousands
of
miles
and
never
yet
used
crammed
their
web
belts
with
cartridges
slung
their
sheathed
machetes
down
their
left
thighs
looked
to
their
guns
and
announced
themselves
ready
to
go
while
the
northerners
made
these
final
preparations
their
guides
slipped
away
for
a
time
pedro
on
his
return
announced
that
the
canoes
had
been
concealed
lourenço
bringing
back
the
freshly
filled
canteens
of
the
men
delivered
with
them
the
marching
orders
of
the
day
if
you
thirst
comrades
drink
only
from
your
canteens
if
the
canteens
fail
never
fill
them
from
flowing
water
unless
the
indians
also
drink
from
the
stream
there
are
always
small
pools
to
be
found
and
though
their
water
may
be
warm
and
stale
it
is
not
likely
to
be
poisoned
as
the
streams
may
be
and
every
day
after
we
meet
the
cannibals
make
no
suspicious
moves
do
not
speak
harshly
do
not
laugh
or
sneer
at
them
they
are
unreasoning
and
easily
insulted
and
lifelong
foes
when
angered
let
me
do
the
talking
do
not
hold
a
gun
in
a
threatening
manner
or
draw
pistols
unless
you
must
fight
then
kill
above
all
pay
no
attention
to
their
women
now
we
go
i
lead
he
turned
and
strode
away
into
the
fog
as
easily
and
surely
as
if
and
pedro
swung
nonchalantly
after
him
the
others
followed
in
order
hitching
at
their
backstraps
the
ghostly
haze
about
them
now
was
paler
but
through
the
interstices
overhead
came
no
glint
of
sunshine
nor
even
the
glow
of
a
clear
dawn
the
whole
sky
evidently
was
overcast
and
around
the
marching
men
the
gloom
still
lay
thick
yet
lourenço
eyes
seemed
to
bore
through
the
shades
and
the
dark
shroud
blurring
the
trunks
for
his
steady
gait
did
not
falter
the
little
file
hung
close
together
for
all
knew
that
any
man
straggling
would
be
instantly
lost
worming
around
gigantic
columns
crawling
over
rotting
trunks
long
laid
low
changing
direction
abruptly
when
blocked
by
some
great
butt
too
high
to
be
scaled
sinking
in
clinging
mud
the
venturesome
band
wound
along
through
the
wilderness
repeated
glances
at
his
compass
showed
mckay
that
the
general
trend
of
the
march
was
southeast
but
the
impassable
obstacles
encountered
at
frequent
intervals
necessitated
not
only
detours
but
sometimes
actual
walk
four
miles
to
advance
one
was
his
thought
and
for
some
time
it
seemed
that
such
was
the
case
but
then
the
ground
changed
the
light
improved
the
trees
thinned
and
the
undergrowth
became
more
dense
and
paradoxically
the
rate
of
progress
improved
this
was
because
the
smaller
growth
gave
the
two
leaders
a
chance
to
cut
their
way
straight
onward
instead
of
dodging
about
and
cut
they
did
their
machetes
swung
with
untiring
energy
opening
a
path
through
what
seemed
an
impenetrable
tangle
now
every
yard
of
movement
was
a
yard
gained
but
the
ground
was
rising
and
the
struggle
up
some
of
the
sharp
slopes
winded
more
than
one
man
then
the
slope
dipped
the
other
way
and
they
slipped
down
into
a
ravine
where
water
gleamed
darkly
here
a
halt
was
called
while
the
leaders
sought
for
a
fallen
tree
tim
squatted
and
mopped
his
face
for
the
hundredth
time

a
call
from
pedro
forestalled
any
answer
the
trio
struggled
along
to
the
spot
where
the
guides
waited
at
the
butt
of
a
slanting
tree
trunk
spanning
the
gulf
as
they
reached
it
pedro
walked
carefully
up
the
trunk
carrying
a
long
slender
sapling
which
he
lowered
and
fixed
in
the
bottom
of
the
stream
then
steadying
himself
with
the
upper
end
of
this
pole
he
continued
his
journey
to
the
other
side
where
he
flipped
the
sapling

and
looking
down
saw
that
the
surface
of
the
water
was
dotted
with
the
heads
of
venomous
snakes
are
you
following
your
trail
of
yesterday
demanded
mckay
no
capitao
yesterday
we
circled
we
go
as
nearly
straight
as
possible
and
you
can
find
the
appointed
place
by
this
new
route
the
tone
was
dubious
certainly
else
i
should
go
the
other
way
come
up
another
bank
they
toiled
and
on
through
rugged
country
which
seemed
momentarily
to
become
higher
and
harder
to
traverse
in
the
minds
of
the
americans
grew
suspicion
that
for
the
first
time
the
brazilians
were
bluffing
it
seemed
impossible
for
any
man
to
keep
his
sense
of
direction
in
such
a
maze
but
they
said
no
word
and
followed
on
at
length
the
leader
paused
and
sent
the
long
call
of
the
mutum
floating
through
the
trees
no
answer
came
after
a
moment
the
line
moved
on
each
man
peering
ahead
with
sharper
gaze
each
holding
a
little
tighter
to
the
americans
at
least
the
thought
of
possible
ambush
loomed
large
four
savages
hidden
in
this
labyrinthine
tangle
and
armed
with
arrows
whose
slightest
scratch
meant
death
could
strike
down
every
man
of
this
expedition
without
even
a
wound
in
return
for
of
what
avail
were
guns
automatic
pistols
and
machetes
against
invisible
enemies
yet
there
was
assurance
in
lourenço
confident
air
and
reassurance
in
the
thought
that
these
tribemen
would
be
unlikely
to
assail
a
band
avowedly
on
its
way
to
visit
their
chief
besides
knowlton
smiled
grimly
even
if
the
mayorunas
hungered
for
human
flesh
it
would
be
more
economical
of
labor
to
let
the
meat
travel
to
the
slaughterhouse
on
its
own
legs
than
to
kill
it
here
and
carry
it
home
again
the
mutum
whistle
drifted
away
again
no
answer
came
for
a
short
distance
farther
the
file
continued
its
march
then
in
a
small
opening
where
the
uptorn
roots
of
a
tree
rose
like
a
wall
at
one
side
it
halted
the
place
of
meeting
pedro
said
all
peered
around
none
saw
anything
but
the
upstanding
roots
the
forest
jumble
the
misty
serpentine
lianas
none
heard
any
sound
but
their
own
hoarse
breathing
the
solemn
drip
of
water
the
insect
hum
and
the
occasional
melancholy
notes
of
birds
the
place
seemed
bare
of
life
yet
upon
mckay
came
again
that
feeling
of
being
watched
slowly
deeply
lourenço
spoke
the
words
meant
nothing
to
his
mates
they
were
like
no
words
they
knew
his
eyes
roved
about
as
he
talked
and
it
was
evident
that
he
saw
no
more
than
did
the
silent
men
behind
him
but
they
guessed
that
he
said
he
and
they
were
there
as
agreed
with
peace
in
their
hearts
and
that
he
was
telling
the
men
of
the
wilderness
to
come
forward
without
fear
and
they
guessed
rightly
as
quietly
as
a
phantom
of
the
mist
a
man
took
shape
at
the
edge
of
the
tree
roots
tall
straight
slender
symmetrically
proportioned
with
unblemished
skin
of
hue
straight
black
hair
and
deep
dark
eyes
he
was
a
splendid
type
of
savage
face
and
body
were
adorned
with
glossy
paint
scarlet
and
black
rings
around
the
eyes
two
red
stripes
from
temple
to
chin
wavy
lines
on
arms
and
chest
he
held
a
bow
longer
than
himself
with
a
arrow
fitted
loosely
to
the
string
and
pointed
downward
but
ready
for
instant
use
diagonally
across
his
body
ran
a
cord
supporting
a
quiver
from
which
the
feathered
shafts
of
several
arrows
projected
above
his
left
shoulder
around
his
waist
looped
another
cord
from
which
dangled
a
small
loin
mat
otherwise
he
was
totally
nude
a
bronze
statue
of
freedom
lourenço
spoke
again
in
the
same
quiet
tone
the
savage
stepped
warily
forward
at
the
same
moment
three
other
naked
men
appeared
with
equal
stealth
from
tree
trunks
which
had
seemed
barren
of
all
life
like
the
first
each
of
these
held
an
arrow
ready
but
pointing
downward
and
each
moved
with
the
slow
velvety
step
of
a
hunting
jaguar
their
eyes
searched
those
of
these
strange
men
of
another
world
who
wearing
useless
clothing
carrying
heavy
weapons
of
steel
burdening
themselves
with
queer
weights
on
their
backs
now
invaded
the
wilderness
which
they
and
their
fathers
had
roamed
untrammeled
for
centuries
the
invaders
in
turn
studied
the
faces
of
the
mayorunas
of
whom
so
many
gruesome
tales
were
told
for
long
silent
minutes
primitive
and
civilized
man
probed
each
other
for
signs
of
treachery
and
found
none
tim
forgetting
the
orders
of
the
day
spoke
out
abruptly
at
the
gruff
jar
of
his
voice
the
wild
men
started
and
raised
their
weapons
say
are
those
guys
cannibals
i
was
lookin
to
see
some
ugly
mutts
with
underslung
jaws
and
mops
o
frizzy
hair
like
them
feejee
islanders
ye
see
pitchers
of
barrin
the
paint
i
seen
fellers
than
these
back
home
with
which
he
gave
the
savages
a
wide
unmistakably
approving
grin
shut
up
muttered
mckay
lourenço
unruffled
made
instant
capital
of
tim
remarks
my
comrade
of
the
red
hair
he
said
in
the
indian
tongue
has
never
before
seen
the
mighty
warriors
of
the
mayorunas
and
is
astonished
to
find
them
such
handsome
men
he
says
his
own
countrymen
are
not
so
good
to
look
upon
slowly
the
menacing
arrows
sank
as
the
savages
studied
tim
wholesome
grin
and
absorbed
the
broad
flattery
of
lourenço
a
slight
smile
passed
over
their
faces
they
stood
more
at
ease
the
whites
sensed
at
once
that
for
a
moment
at
least
a
friendly
footing
had
been
established
and
relaxed
from
their
own
tension
once
more
lourenço
spoke
motioning
toward
the
farther
distances
the
indian
who
had
first
appeared
now
replied
briefly
two
of
the
others
stepped
back
to
their
trees
and
lifted
long
hollow
tubes
what
them
demanded
tim
blowguns
pedro
answered
they
use
them
for
small
or
game
see
the
two
blowgun
men
carry
also
short
darts
in
their
quivers
and
small
pouches
of
poison
they
like
their
poison
a
dang
sight
better
i
do
say
are
them
guys
goin
to
march
behind
us
i
do
want
no
poison
needles
slipped
into
my
back
accidental
or
other
ways
two
of
the
savages
were
walking
toward
the
rear
of
the
line
knowlton
exasperated
snapped
out
they
walk
where
they
like
and
you
do
well
to
give
us
more
marching
and
less
mouth
you
nearly
spilled
the
beans
just
now
and
if
lourenço
had
said
something
that
pleased
these
fellows
we
all
might
be
in
the
soup
this
minute
pipe
down
aw
looey
i
only
said
these
guys
were
ai
no
fight
in
words
like
that
you
heard
the
orders
this
morning
let
lourenço
do
the
talking
that
goes
we
skating
on
thin
ice
so
thin
that
if
it
breaks
we
drop
plump
into
hell
less
noise
right
sir
was
the
sulky
answer
i
deaf
and
dumb
march
added
mckay
the
head
of
the
column
already
was
on
the
move
led
by
the
tallest
indian
and
a
blowgun
man
behind
whom
walked
the
two
brazilians
the
whole
line
took
up
the
step
in
turn
and
passed
on
into
the
unknown
again
mckay
consulted
his
compass
at
intervals
finding
that
now
the
route
led
more
to
the
south
though
there
still
was
an
easterly
trend
after
a
time
however
the
telltale
needle
informed
him
that
they
were
proceeding
almost
due
east
and
glances
at
the
surroundings
showed
that
on
their
right
was
a
densely
matted
mass
of
undergrowth
not
long
afterward
another
interwoven
brush
wall
blocked
the
way
and
this
time
the
leader
veered
to
the
west
not
until
an
opening
appeared
did
he
resume
his
southward
course
it
dawned
on
mckay
that
the
savages
having
no
bush
knives
were
accustomed
to
follow
the
line
of
least
resistance
this
obviously
increased
the
distance
traveled
the
men
of
coronel
nunes
too
perceived
this
a
halt
was
called
during
which
lourenço
talked
with
the
guide
tapped
his
machete
and
evidently
protested
against
needless
detours
the
leader
with
a
few
words
pointed
south
lourenço
nodded
and
replied
the
march
was
resumed
and
when
the
next
impenetrable
tangle
was
encountered
the
indians
in
the
van
stepped
aside
the
machetes
of
the
brazilians
flashed
out
and
a
way
was
cut
straight
through
from
that
time
on
the
long
knives
came
into
frequent
play
and
a
direct
course
was
maintained
suddenly
with
a
grunt
of
warning
the
tall
tribesman
stopped
the
plan
of
chopping
through
instead
of
going
around
had
brought
the
indians
into
a
part
of
the
forest
which
they
had
not
heretofore
traversed
in
their
search
for
the
missing
hunter
now
they
stood
in
a
small
trough
between
the
knolls
under
trees
around
which
grew
little
brush
the
ground
was
soft
almost
watery
in
the
damp
air
faint
but
unmistakable
hung
the
odor
of
death
the
savages
at
the
rear
came
forward
at
once
all
four
of
them
spread
out
and
sniffing
the
air
advanced
up
the
trough
a
cry
broke
from
one
of
them
the
others
and
the
white
men
too
hastened
to
the
spot
whence
the
call
had
come
scattered
about
in
the
soft
muck
were
bones
two
skulls
bits
of
tawny
fur
a
long
bow
several
arrows
around
them
the
ground
was
marked
with
many
tracks
most
of
the
imprints
were
of
the
vultures
which
had
stripped
the
bones
but
there
were
others
those
of
a
barefoot
man
of
a
great
cat
and
of
a
couple
of
wild
hogs
the
peccary
tracks
went
straight
on
but
those
of
the
man
and
the
cat
showed
that
a
fierce
struggle
had
occurred
and
one
of
the
two
grinning
skulls
was
that
of
a
jaguar
the
story
was
plain
the
hunter
following
fast
on
the
trail
of
the
hogs
had
suddenly
met
the
jaguar
he
had
shot
it
one
arrow
blood
stained
for
more
than
a
foot
above
the
barb
proved
that
but
in
the
few
seconds
of
life
left
to
it
the
animal
had
sprung
and
fatally
torn
the
man
then
as
usual
had
dropped
the
black
scavengers
of
the
sky
to
rend
them
both
silently
the
men
of
the
bush
and
the
men
of
the
north
looked
down
at
the
brief
history
written
in
the
mud
a
story
only
a
week
old
yet
ancient
as
human
life
itself
primitive
man
and
ferocious
brute
destroying
each
other
as
in
the
prehistoric
days
when
tiger
and
troglodyte
hunted
and
slew
for
the
right
to
live
and
as
it
had
been
then
so
it
was
now
the
living
read
the
tale
of
tragedy
and
passed
on
leaving
the
bones
behind
them
only
before
they
went
the
mayorunas
threw
the
remnants
of
the
jaguar
aside
and
piled
the
bones
of
their
dead
comrade
together
in
one
place
then
bearing
with
them
his
bow
and
arrows
they
resumed
their
way
without
a
word
chapter
xiv
a
duel
with
death
rain
came
and
went
the
first
night
camp
of
the
strangely
assorted
company
was
a
wet
one
for
well
on
in
the
day
the
skies
poured
down
the
watery
weight
which
had
been
troubling
them
once
morning
yet
even
in
such
miserable
weather
the
four
tribesmen
of
the
mayorunas
declined
to
sleep
in
the
same
camp
with
the
whites
they
accepted
the
food
tendered
them
but
when
it
was
eaten
they
withdrew
to
some
covert
of
their
own
to
spend
the
night
whereby
the
whites
knew
that
though
their
guides
now
could
no
longer
suspect
them
of
killing
the
lone
hunter
they
still
were
not
accepted
as
friends
did
ye
say
them
guys
had
a
trick
of
jabbin
men
in
their
hammicks
at
night
renzo
was
tim
significant
question
after
the
indians
had
departed
have
no
fear
lourenço
assured
him
they
have
promised
to
take
us
safely
to
their
chief
how
much
is
the
word
of
a
cannibal
worth
asked
knowlton
worth
everything
so
long
as
you
do
nothing
to
make
them
forget
it
senhor
being
uncivilized
they
are
not
liars
the
lieutenant
eyed
him
sharply
half
minded
to
regard
the
answer
as
insolent
but
there
was
no
insolence
in
the
brazilian
straightforward
gaze
and
mckay
laughed
approvingly
well
spoken
was
the
captain
comment
among
those
people
there
are
but
two
great
crimes
lourenço
added
they
are
to
speak
falsely
or
to
be
a
coward
wherein
a
goodly
portion
of
the
civilized
world
would
fail
to
measure
up
to
the
standards
of
these
cannibals
mckay
said
by
the
way
have
you
asked
them
about
the
raposa
no
capitao
it
is
as
well
not
to
put
into
their
heads
the
idea
that
we
are
hunting
anyone
here
i
shall
say
nothing
of
that
matter
until
we
reach
the
chief
who
knows
me
good
idea
with
that
the
talk
ended
and
all
sought
their
hammocks
dog
tired
from
the
day
travel
no
watch
was
kept
for
as
pedro
quaintly
phrased
it
we
now
are
in
the
hands
of
god
and
the
cannibals
nor
was
any
watch
needed
daybreak
brought
sunlight
while
the
breakfast
coffee
was
being
boiled
the
four
wild
men
appeared
silently
and
simultaneously
one
bringing
a
red
howling
monkey
and
another
a
large
green
parrot
as
their
contributions
to
the
morning
meal
neither
bird
nor
animal
showed
any
wound
except
a
slightly
discolored
spot
surrounding
a
skin
puncture
no
larger
than
if
made
by
a
woman
hatpin
the
marks
left
by
poisoned
darts
from
the
blowguns
when
the
meat
was
cooked
they
offered
portions
to
the
whites
of
whom
tim
alone
refused
i
as
quick
eat
a
rat
killed
with
paris
green
he
growled
no
poisoned
meat
gits
into
my
stummick
if
i
know
it
bosh
scoffed
mckay
it
perfectly
wholesome
though
it
tough
as
a
rubber
boot
and
i
might
tell
you
senhores
that
among
these
people
it
is
an
insult
to
refuse
any
food
offered
you
added
lourenço
i
advise
you
to
forget
about
the
poison
hereafter
and
eat
what
is
put
before
you
even
if
it
stinks
his
advice
was
emphasized
by
the
evident
displeasure
of
the
tribesmen
who
though
saying
nothing
looked
rather
grimly
at
the
man
who
had
despised
their
provisions
but
lourenço
then
smoothed
over
the
matter
by
telling
them
that
the
man
was
sick
at
the
stomach
that
morning
which
at
that
particular
moment
was
not
far
from
the
truth
soon
the
triglot
column
was
once
more
on
its
way
across
the
hill
country
which
hourly
grew
higher
and
rougher
a
constant
succession
of
ridges
and
ravines
lourenço
pointing
out
the
absence
of
water
marks
on
the
trees
of
the
uplands
said
that
now
the
land
of
the
great
annual
floods
had
been
left
behind
for
even
the
rise
of
waters
in
the
rainy
season
could
not
reach
to
these
hilltops
with
the
entry
into
this
terra
firma
the
travelers
had
also
found
the
sun
again
the
dank
mist
of
yesterday
having
vanished
nevertheless
the
going
was
fully
as
hard
as
on
the
previous
day
because
of
the
density
of
the
bush
and
of
the
labor
of
crossing
the
narrow
but
deep
streams
flowing
at
the
bottom
of
nearly
every
clove
few
words
were
exchanged
every
man
needing
his
breath
for
the
work
of
walking
as
before
the
keen
machetes
of
the
brazilians
opened
a
direct
route
through
all
opposing
undergrowth
when
a
brief
halt
was
called
at
noon
the
mayorunas
who
seemed
to
know
exactly
where
they
were
despite
the
fact
that
they
had
never
before
followed
this
straight
course
informed
lourenço
that
much
circuitous
traveling
had
already
been
saved
and
that
by
tramping
hard
until
sundown
they
might
succeed
in
reaching
the
tribal
that
night
but
mckay
vetoed
the
idea
of
a
forced
march
this
gait
is
fast
enough
and
hard
enough
he
declared
no
sense
in
exhausting
ourselves
to
save
a
few
hours
time
also
we
do
want
to
go
staggering
into
the
mayoruna
village
with
our
tongues
hanging
out
and
our
knees
wabbling
first
impressions
are
lasting
with
such
people
and
they
might
get
an
idea
we
were
weaklings
to
which
all
except
the
savages
who
did
not
understand
the
language
of
the
white
man
assented
approvingly
yet
it
was
the
mayorunas
themselves
who
delayed
arrival
at
their
the
mayorunas
and
a
monkey
when
the
sinking
sun
was
still
two
hours
high
and
while
the
leader
was
forcing
the
pace
as
if
determined
to
reach
home
that
night
whether
the
rest
liked
it
or
not
the
monkey
upset
any
such
plan
he
was
a
big
gray
monkey
and
he
was
high
up
in
the
branches
of
a
tall
matamata
tree
where
he
deemed
himself
safe
from
the
many
creatures
laboring
along
the
ground
below
wherefore
he
chattered
impudently
down
at
them
and
as
the
tall
indian
guide
halted
showed
his
teeth
derisively
the
savage
grunted
the
man
behind
him
also
grunted
and
lifted
his
blowgun
but
the
leader
growled
at
him
and
the
blowgun
sank
with
a
swift
sweep
of
the
hand
the
guide
drew
from
his
quiver
one
of
those
long
poisoned
arrows
and
fitted
it
to
the
bow
cord
which
he
had
laid
on
the
ground
with
two
toes
of
each
foot
he
held
the
cord
firmly
on
the
soil
his
right
hand
lightly
grasped
the
arrow
and
aimed
it
up
at
the
insolent
primate
his
left
drew
the
bow
up
up
into
an
arc
the
cord
thrummed
as
his
lifted
toes
released
it
the
arrow
whirred
aloft
then
a
snarl
of
chagrin
from
the
marksman
blended
with
the
grunts
of
his
mates
the
arrow
had
failed
to
reach
the
quarry
it
had
missed
however
by
a
mere
hand
breadth
missed
only
because
it
struck
the
limb
directly
under
the
monkey
where
it
hung
by
the
tip
from
the
bark
muttering
something
which
may
have
been
a
mayoruna
malediction
the
savage
moved
aside
a
step
or
two
drew
another
arrow
and
set
it
to
the
cord
with
more
care
than
before
but
while
he
did
this
the
monkey
was
not
idle
chattering
in
rage
the
animal
leaned
down
worked
the
arrow
loose
from
the
bark
and
threw
it
aside
the
deadly
shaft
turned
in
air
then
plunged
aimlessly
earthward
at
that
instant
all
below
were
watching
the
guide
who
in
turn
was
looking
at
his
toes
and
placing
the
new
arrow
in
position
unseen
the
other
missile
hurtled
down
and
ripped
across
the
back
of
the
marksman
left
hand
for
an
instant
the
tall
cannibal
stood
as
if
petrified
staring
at
his
cut
hand
and
the
shaft
now
sticking
upright
in
the
ground
beside
him
then
in
simple
symbolism
he
reversed
the
new
arrow
and
stabbed
it
also
into
the
dirt
dropping
his
bow
he
lay
down
on
his
back
yuara
will
draw
bow
no
more
yuara
goes
to
join
the
spirits
of
the
dead
he
said
calmly
mechanically
lourenço
translated
the
words
mckay
sprang
forward
no
he
disputed
not
without
a
try
for
life
anyhow
merry
sling
a
tourniquet
quick
knowlton
jumped
to
the
side
of
yuara
tied
a
handkerchief
above
the
elbow
twisted
it
tight
mckay
whipped
from
a
pocket
a
knife
in
one
swift
ruthless
slash
he
laid
open
the
arm
from
elbow
to
knuckles
keep
that
tourniquet
tight
he
snapped
if
the
blood
once
gets
past
it
he
gone
tim
get
out
the
salt
bag
lourenço
tell
this
fellow
to
breathe
deep
and
keep
it
up
while
tim
burrowed
into
his
pack
for
the
salt
lourenço
spoke
as
much
for
the
benefit
of
the
other
tribesmen
as
for
that
of
yuara
for
the
three
mayorunas
stood
in
ominous
silence
watching
the
outrush
of
blood
caused
by
the
knife
of
the
white
man
the
white
man
of
the
black
beard
who
is
very
wise
will
save
yuara
to
draw
many
a
good
bow
if
yuara
will
do
as
he
says
let
yuara
breathe
deeply
that
the
spirit
of
life
remain
in
him
to
fight
against
the
demon
of
death
even
now
the
poison
rushes
out
of
the
arm
of
yuara
yuara
can
not
live
was
yuara
cool
reply
where
once
the
poison
has
entered
there
follows
death
is
yuara
then
a
coward
that
he
will
die
without
a
fight
then
he
is
no
mayoruna
for
no
mayoruna
is
a
coward
let
yuara
die
if
he
will
his
comrades
shall
carry
to
their
the
tale
that
although
the
white
man
would
have
saved
him
he
died
like
an
old
woman
because
he
had
not
the
will
to
live
fire
shot
into
the
eyes
of
the
prostrate
man
he
ground
his
teeth
and
struggled
to
rise
and
throttle
the
insulting
brazilian
no
not
that
way
lourenço
went
on
at
once
yuara
can
fight
the
death
demon
only
by
drawing
into
himself
the
air
in
which
is
the
spirit
of
life
the
wise
white
man
has
stopped
the
poison
at
the
place
where
the
cloth
is
tied
and
he
knows
the
air
spirits
will
help
yuara
if
yuara
will
breathe
deep
and
long
if
he
will
not
then
the
white
medicine
can
not
save
him
yuara
life
or
death
is
in
his
own
hands
in
his
heart
lourenço
had
faint
hope
that
the
injured
man
would
live
but
he
knew
the
rest
of
the
cannibal
tribe
must
soon
hear
the
tale
of
this
incident
from
the
three
now
present
and
he
was
preparing
an
excellent
excuse
for
the
failure
of
mckay
to
save
him
whether
yuara
lived
or
not
the
mayorunas
now
would
know
that
the
whites
had
done
their
utmost
for
him
and
that
very
fact
might
make
a
vast
difference
yuara
though
his
eyes
still
flamed
sank
back
under
mckay
restraining
weight
and
obeyed
orders
after
the
first
couple
of
breaths
he
settled
into
his
task
and
his
chest
rose
and
fell
rhythmically
here
yer
salt
cap
what
i
do
with
it
you
come
here
and
hold
this
tourniquet
do
let
it
slip
merry
fill
this
chap
mouth
with
salt
lourenço
tell
him
to
hold
it
as
long
as
possible
then
swallow
it
now
merry
fix
up
a
good
strong
salt
poultice
the
rest
of
you
make
camp
we
got
a
stiff
fight
on
our
hands
and
we
ca
go
farther
until
we
either
won
or
lost
the
brazilians
glanced
at
the
sun
shadows
and
remained
where
they
were
according
to
their
experience
yuara
should
be
dead
within
ten
minutes
at
most
time
enough
to
make
camp
when
they
knew
how
this
venture
would
result
the
mayorunas
also
stood
fast
and
watched
for
the
shadow
of
death
to
blanch
the
face
of
their
stricken
mate
but
the
minutes
dragged
past
and
yuara
eyes
did
not
grow
dim
his
first
resignation
over
and
his
fighting
blood
aroused
he
was
battling
grimly
against
fate
at
times
his
deep
respirations
were
broken
by
sudden
gasps
and
spasmodic
quivers
shook
his
whole
body
but
he
breathed
on
paying
no
heed
to
the
burning
pain
of
his
ripped
and
salted
arm
by
cripes
he
puttin
up
a
man
scrap
blurted
tim
stay
with
it
old
feller
ye
win
out
yet
and
as
more
minutes
passed
and
the
wounded
man
still
breathed
a
murmur
of
wonderment
passed
among
the
cannibals
and
the
men
of
nunes
yuara
should
be
dead
yet
he
was
not
even
paralyzed
such
a
thing
had
never
before
been
known
in
this
bush
lourenço
touched
pedro
arm
find
a
spot
where
we
can
make
camp
he
said
i
must
stay
here
to
speak
to
the
wild
men
if
words
are
needed
reluctantly
pedro
went
away
soon
he
was
back
with
news
of
a
suitable
place
he
found
all
bending
closer
over
yuara
whose
breathing
had
become
stertorous
and
whose
eyes
seemed
fixed
going
was
the
bushman
thought
but
the
others
would
not
have
it
so
how
a
shot
o
booze
to
jolt
his
heart
cap
suggested
tim
whose
whole
soul
was
in
the
fight
mckay
nodded
knowlton
quickly
produced
brandy
and
poured
a
stiff
dose
down
yuara
throat
it
took
hold
at
once
and
light
came
back
into
the
indian
eyes
got
a
good
chance
yet
mckay
asserted
do
loosen
that
tourniquet
let
the
arm
mortify
if
necessary
but
hold
that
blood
away
from
the
heart
at
all
costs
i
chop
his
arm
off
at
the
shoulder
before
give
in
his
face
showed
he
meant
it
lourenço
spoke
to
the
mayorunas
urging
that
camp
be
made
at
once
he
and
pedro
strode
away
and
all
three
of
the
indians
followed
really
think
he
pull
through
rod
knowlton
asked
then
if
he
does
you
a
miracle
worker
it
an
experiment
mckay
confessed
watching
yuara
with
unswerving
intentness
never
saw
this
done
but
it
worth
a
try
and
i
honestly
believe
it
will
work
i
saved
an
indian
over
in
guiana
once
by
cutting
off
his
arm
as
soon
as
he
was
hit
but
i
want
to
keep
this
fellow
arm
for
him
if
possible
feed
him
some
more
salt
time
passed
unheeded
sounds
of
labor
not
far
off
told
that
camp
was
being
built
presently
the
absent
five
returned
two
of
the
mayorunas
carrying
a
crude
but
strong
litter
constructed
from
saplings
and
leaves
mckay
rose
stiffly
on
cramped
legs
all
right
you
can
move
him
he
consented
carefully
yuara
was
lifted
to
the
litter
and
transported
to
the
new
camp
there
the
americans
found
not
only
the
open
shed
or
usually
constructed
by
the
brazilians
but
also
a
somewhat
similar
shelter
erected
by
the
indians
in
the
latter
stood
two
stout
crotched
stakes
firmly
braced
the
handiwork
of
pedro
and
lourenço
and
to
these
with
tough
bush
rope
the
indians
fastened
the
litter
of
yuara
thus
forming
a
rude
but
effective
hammock
while
mckay
and
knowlton
continued
their
ministrations
to
the
stricken
man
the
rest
of
the
camp
work
was
completed
the
mayorunas
making
hanging
beds
for
themselves
from
withes
leaves
and
bush
cord
and
the
brazilians
slinging
the
hammocks
of
their
own
party
and
opening
packs
night
fell
and
the
wounded
man
lived
on
supper
was
eaten
pipes
smoked
the
regular
activities
of
the
early
hours
of
darkness
gone
through
and
yuara
lived
on
his
deep
breathing
had
become
automatic
and
his
eyes
stared
straight
up
in
concentration
on
his
battle
with
the
death
demon
at
length
he
was
seized
with
violent
nausea
which
convulsed
him
for
a
time
but
when
the
spasms
passed
he
lay
back
more
easily
and
a
faint
smile
flitted
over
his
face
as
he
looked
at
the
white
men
been
expecting
that
said
mckay
might
loosen
that
ligature
now
just
a
few
seconds
tighten
it
all
right
alter
watching
the
sick
man
a
little
longer
he
added
now
i
going
to
eat
and
smoke
feel
like
taking
a
drink
too
but
guess
i
wo
the
indian
will
pull
through
now
i
think
when
he
had
returned
to
the
indian
hut
with
pipe
aglow
knowlton
asked
him
now
tell
us
how
you
doped
out
this
cure
combination
of
various
things
salt
is
a
partial
antidote
to
venom
in
the
blood
and
i
got
it
into
him
in
three
ways
by
mouth
absorption
by
the
stomach
and
by
the
salt
poultice
which
drew
out
some
of
the
poison
from
the
forearm
and
helped
neutralize
what
remained
ripping
his
arm
of
course
let
out
a
lot
of
bad
blood
ligature
above
the
elbow
stopped
most
of
the
rest
though
some
sneaked
past
that
point
i
pretty
sure
big
thing
though
was
the
deep
breathing
remember
i
told
you
about
the
experiments
that
killed
mules
and
an
ox
another
experiment
was
this
opening
the
windpipe
of
a
poisoned
mule
after
the
heart
stopped
inserting
a
pair
of
bellows
and
starting
artificial
respiration
after
four
hours
of
this
the
mule
came
to
life
and
stayed
alive
though
he
was
a
wreck
for
a
year
afterward
i
just
put
all
these
together
made
the
indian
do
his
own
breathing
and
here
he
is
i
going
to
sit
up
awhile
longer
and
watch
him
but
the
critical
period
is
over
you
chaps
can
turn
in
but
none
turned
in
until
midnight
when
no
doubt
remained
that
lourenço
prophecy
would
come
true
that
yuara
would
live
to
draw
bow
again
then
when
the
slashed
arm
had
been
thoroughly
cleansed
and
bound
lourenço
spoke
once
more
to
the
savages
the
medicine
of
the
wise
white
man
and
the
air
spirits
have
saved
yuara
from
the
death
demon
yuara
has
fought
as
a
man
of
his
tribe
should
fight
and
so
has
lived
when
he
would
have
died
yuara
shall
once
more
see
his
people
the
first
man
of
the
mayorunas
to
come
back
from
the
death
of
poison
and
he
and
his
comrades
shall
tell
of
the
white
man
wisdom
without
which
he
now
would
lie
cold
on
the
ground
so
shall
it
be
yuara
himself
faintly
answered
yuara
son
of
rana
second
chief
of
the
men
of
suba
will
not
forget
deus
exclaimed
lourenço
comrades
this
man
is
no
common
hunter
but
son
of
a
subchief
capitao
you
have
done
good
work
chapter
xv
the
cannibals
through
the
long
dim
shadows
of
early
morning
the
little
column
passed
on
the
last
leg
of
its
journey
to
the
of
suba
chief
of
this
outlying
tribe
of
the
mayorunas
at
its
head
marched
yuara
his
left
arm
incased
in
bandages
his
face
drawn
and
pallid
his
stride
stiff
and
springless
but
still
carrying
his
weapons
and
stoically
setting
the
pace
as
befitted
the
son
of
a
subchief
he
had
had
no
sleep
he
had
lain
in
the
gates
of
death
his
arm
ached
cruelly
yet
a
warm
glow
shone
in
his
hollow
eyes
as
he
reflected
on
the
fact
that
in
all
the
unwritten
history
of
his
people
he
was
the
first
man
to
survive
the
inexorable
power
of
the
wurali
as
long
as
he
lived
this
fact
would
lift
him
above
the
level
of
all
his
fellows
even
the
chief
could
not
boast
of
such
a
superhuman
feat
the
undergrowth
this
morning
was
not
so
thick
as
it
had
been
and
the
machetes
of
lourenço
and
pedro
stayed
in
their
sheaths
the
ground
too
was
more
level
and
the
footing
more
firm
after
some
three
hours
of
walking
the
americans
found
that
they
had
come
into
a
faint
path
somewhat
to
the
bewilderment
of
the
white
men
who
expected
the
indians
to
increase
their
speed
now
that
the
way
home
lay
under
their
feet
the
leading
pair
slowed
their
gait
moreover
they
scanned
the
trail
with
intent
care
and
watched
the
trees
along
the
way
at
length
with
a
warning
grunt
yuara
stepped
out
of
the
path
and
began
a
detour
his
comrade
and
the
brazilians
followed
the
americans
stopped
what
the
idea
demanded
mckay
looking
along
the
path
probably
a
man
trap
capitao
answered
pedro
follow
us
let
see
the
trap
first
lourenço
called
to
yuara
who
stopped
and
grunted
two
words
it
is
a
trap
a
pit
yuara
says
yuara
spoke
again
and
lourenço
added
he
says
we
must
not
touch
it
it
is
there
just
before
you
covered
so
cunningly
that
it
looks
exactly
like
the
rest
of
the
ground
the
cover
is
a
framework
of
sticks
balanced
on
a
pole
and
the
instant
a
man
steps
on
it
it
gives
way
he
falls
into
a
hole
whose
sides
are
dug
inward
so
that
they
overhang
above
him
there
the
cannibals
find
him
and
kill
him
i
fell
into
one
of
those
holes
when
i
first
came
into
this
mayoruna
country
so
i
know
just
how
they
are
made
so
how
did
you
get
out
there
were
two
of
us
and
i
stood
on
the
other
man
shoulders
while
he
lifted
me
high
enough
to
jump
out
then
i
tied
bush
rope
to
a
tree
and
he
climbed
up
the
rope
come
yuara
waits
after
a
short
circuit
around
the
danger
point
the
party
returned
to
the
path
and
as
they
went
on
lourenço
explained
further
concerning
the
pit
every
approach
to
the
has
this
kind
of
trap
hidden
in
it
and
others
also
the
indians
recognize
the
places
by
some
secret
signal
known
only
to
themselves
a
certain
kind
of
stick
or
vine
or
something
of
the
kind
placed
where
it
can
be
seen
by
those
who
understand
the
traps
are
made
to
stop
any
enemies
who
try
to
sneak
up
on
the
and
catch
these
people
unawares
another
kind
of
trap
is
a
spring
bow
or
a
blowgun
shot
by
a
vine
stretched
across
the
path
still
another
is
a
piece
of
ground
studded
with
poisoned
araya
bones
which
pierce
the
bare
feet
of
anyone
walking
on
them
it
is
well
for
us
that
we
now
have
friendly
guides
quite
so
mckay
agreed
dryly
some
distance
farther
on
the
leader
again
left
the
path
and
this
time
all
filed
after
him
without
comment
pedro
pointed
significantly
at
a
thin
bush
cord
stretched
across
the
path
at
the
height
of
a
man
ankle
the
trigger
which
would
discharge
hidden
death
at
anything
touching
it
at
another
point
perhaps
a
hundred
feet
farther
along
a
third
and
last
detour
was
made
and
this
time
the
nature
of
the
trap
was
not
revealed
by
anything
on
the
ground
no
questions
were
asked
with
the
passing
of
these
three
menaces
yuara
resumed
his
former
pace
and
abandoned
his
circumspection
before
long
came
sounds
of
communal
life
the
barking
of
a
dog
and
shouts
of
children
then
suddenly
the
forest
thinned
and
after
a
few
more
strides
the
marchers
found
themselves
in
a
clearing
before
them
rose
a
big
round
house
about
forty
feet
high
and
a
hundred
feet
in
diameter
its
sides
composed
of
palm
logs
and
its
roof
a
thick
thatch
of
palm
leaves
whence
smoke
oozed
lazily
through
an
opening
at
the
peak
a
single
low
door
not
more
than
four
feet
high
opened
toward
a
creek
a
few
rods
away
at
the
right
near
this
doorway
a
couple
of
naked
children
boy
and
girl
were
playing
with
the
dog
while
beyond
them
a
number
of
women
also
nude
were
busy
at
some
kind
of
work
as
yuara
and
his
entered
the
open
space
the
boy
shouted
a
greeting
and
started
running
toward
them
then
seeing
the
white
men
filing
from
the
bush
behind
the
warriors
the
youngster
stood
as
if
shocked
motionless
after
one
long
stare
he
screamed
and
bolted
for
the
shelter
of
the
other
screams
echoed
his
as
the
women
also
saw
the
bearded
outlanders
they
too
dived
through
the
doorway
out
from
behind
the
house
leaped
three
warriors
two
of
whom
already
had
fitted
arrows
to
their
bows
while
the
third
a
powerful
fellow
clutched
a
war
club
weapons
raised
faces
contracted
into
fighting
masks
they
stared
speechless
at
the
spectacle
of
the
subchief
son
calmly
leading
whites
among
them
knowlton
though
his
attention
was
riveted
on
the
astonished
warriors
caught
the
quiet
snick
of
tim
being
turned
off
none
of
that
tim
he
warned
put
that
safety
on
again
and
hold
your
gun
as
if
you
intended
to
use
it
aw
i
was
jest
tryin
her
to
make
sure
she
was
all
right
put
it
on
snapped
the
lieutenant
another
tiny
click
told
him
the
order
was
obeyed
out
from
the
doorway
darted
another
warrior
stooping
low
to
avoid
hitting
his
head
others
followed
instantly
all
armed
and
ready
for
action
the
opening
was
still
vomiting
tribesmen
when
yuara
and
the
rest
reached
it
but
none
made
a
hostile
move
when
it
was
seen
that
the
son
of
the
subchief
was
in
command
and
that
the
strangers
seemed
friendly
yuara
spoke
briefly
but
authoritatively
and
the
weapons
sank
then
with
a
word
to
his
three
companions
he
ducked
through
the
doorway
the
other
three
remained
where
they
were
we
shall
have
to
wait
now
comrades
until
yuara
tells
his
father
and
the
chief
about
us
lourenço
said
so
let
us
take
off
our
packs
and
rest
he
set
the
example
by
laying
his
rifle
on
the
ground
unslinging
his
pack
squatting
beside
it
and
coolly
rolling
a
cigarette
apparently
he
was
paying
no
attention
whatever
to
the
savages
who
watched
his
every
move
but
mckay
glancing
at
him
as
he
followed
suit
saw
that
for
all
his
seeming
unconcern
the
brazilian
bush
rover
was
keenly
watchful
and
that
his
gun
lay
within
reach
of
his
hand
from
within
the
tribal
house
sounded
the
monotonous
voice
of
yuara
after
listening
a
moment
lourenço
quietly
addressed
the
nearest
warrior
a
slightly
surprised
looked
passed
over
the
cannibal
face
he
replied
and
a
slow
conversation
ensued
meanwhile
the
others
looked
over
the
array
of
savage
fighting
men
except
for
difference
of
stature
build
and
expression
they
were
as
like
as
brothers
all
were
light
skinned
hardly
darker
than
the
whites
themselves
all
had
eyes
with
no
hint
of
the
slant
often
found
among
the
indians
of
the
amazon
headwaters
and
the
cheek
bones
of
all
were
fairly
low
their
average
stature
was
a
little
under
six
feet
and
most
of
them
had
an
athletic
symmetry
of
physique
their
feet
mckay
noticed
were
small
and
shapely
all
wore
tall
feather
headdresses
of
parrot
and
mutum
plumes
all
had
the
scarlet
and
black
rings
around
the
eyes
the
streaks
from
temple
to
chin
the
wavy
design
on
their
bodies
and
each
wore
in
the
cartilage
of
his
nose
a
pair
of
small
feathers
slanting
outward
at
another
time
and
under
other
circumstances
the
white
men
might
have
smiled
at
those
nose
feathers
which
resembled
odd
mustaches
but
as
they
studied
the
austere
faces
around
them
they
found
no
occasion
for
merriment
nor
was
the
tension
lessened
by
the
sight
of
the
weapons
grasped
in
the
strong
hands
of
the
warriors
great
bows
and
arrows
such
as
the
hunters
had
borne
were
supplemented
here
by
the
long
clubs
of
heavy
wood
and
by
ugly
spears
the
clubs
terminated
in
balls
studded
with
jaguar
teeth
the
spears
were
triple
pronged
each
prong
ending
in
a
araya
bone
and
each
bone
darkened
by
the
fatal
wurali
frightful
weapons
they
were
the
one
designed
to
smash
skulls
and
tear
out
brains
the
other
to
stab
and
poison
at
the
same
thrust
lourenço
stopped
talking
and
the
others
observed
that
now
the
wild
men
stood
more
easily
their
holds
on
their
weapons
loosened
i
have
shown
them
capitao
that
i
can
speak
their
tongue
and
told
them
we
go
to
visit
the
chief
monitaya
as
friend
he
explained
they
tell
me
monitaya
has
grown
great
since
last
i
saw
him
another
tribe
which
lost
its
chief
and
subchiefs
by
a
swift
sickness
has
joined
his
own
and
he
now
rules
two
big
together
he
is
a
powerful
fighter
and
if
he
is
friendly
to
us
we
have
a
good
chance
of
success
ah
here
is
yuara
the
son
of
the
subchief
came
through
the
doorway
as
he
spoke
followed
by
an
older
man
whose
facial
resemblance
and
ornaments
indicated
that
he
was
the
subchief
himself
his
headgear
was
more
elaborate
than
that
of
his
men
and
around
his
shoulders
and
down
his
chest
hung
a
brilliant
feather
dress
while
a
wide
belt
of
green
blue
and
black
plumes
encircled
his
hips
yuara
himself
had
inserted
feathers
in
his
nose
and
donned
a
headband
of
tall
parrot
plumes
a
trifle
more
ornate
than
those
worn
by
the
ordinary
fighters
and
somehow
the
simple
addition
seemed
to
transform
him
into
a
bigger
fiercer
man
also
his
eyes
now
held
a
smoldering
light
which
had
not
been
there
before
the
older
man
rana
the
subchief
glanced
swiftly
along
the
line
of
new
faces
then
his
gaze
returned
to
mckay
his
mouth
set
and
his
countenance
turned
hard
he
spoke
curtly
to
yuara
who
replied
with
one
word
after
another
long
unpleasant
look
at
mckay
who
stared
coldly
back
at
him
rana
grunted
a
few
words
and
the
house
lourenço
nonplussed
by
the
frigidity
of
the
subchief
where
he
had
expected
gratitude
or
at
least
hospitality
glanced
questioningly
at
yuara
but
the
young
man
stood
mute
looking
straight
ahead
the
subchief
says
we
shall
enter
and
see
the
chief
we
must
leave
our
guns
outside
do
like
that
muttered
mckay
that
subchief
looks
ugly
but
we
must
obey
or
provoke
a
fight
capitao
besides
our
rifles
would
be
useless
inside
as
they
would
be
instantly
seized
if
we
lifted
them
so
let
us
make
the
best
of
it
but
i
think
you
can
carry
your
pistols
with
you
they
are
covered
by
the
holsters
and
i
do
not
believe
these
people
know
what
they
are
and
since
rana
spoke
only
of
guns
we
will
keep
our
machetes
come
wait
a
second
mckay
dived
a
hand
into
his
haversack
and
brought
forth
a
heavy
hunting
knife
with
a
gaudy
bone
handle
sheathed
and
attached
to
a
leather
belt
brought
this
along
as
a
present
for
some
indian
who
might
do
us
a
good
turn
he
explained
been
thinking
of
giving
it
to
yuara
but
now
pass
it
to
the
chief
might
make
a
difference
all
right
let
go
with
confident
tread
but
with
some
misgiving
the
five
advanced
leaving
guns
and
packs
on
the
ground
one
by
one
they
bent
low
and
got
through
the
doorway
yuara
with
a
word
to
a
clubman
and
a
motion
to
the
equipment
followed
the
whites
trailed
in
turn
by
his
three
companions
of
the
forest
the
clubman
after
a
curious
inspection
of
the
packs
stood
on
guard
among
them
his
bludgeon
grasped
loosely
but
suggestively
ready
to
prevent
any
undue
inquisitiveness
by
the
rest
but
soon
he
found
himself
alone
for
the
other
tribesmen
transferred
their
attention
and
themselves
to
the
interior
of
the
within
the
house
the
soldiers
of
fortune
halted
a
moment
adjusting
their
vision
to
the
sudden
diminution
of
light
except
for
the
sunshine
pouring
in
at
the
smoke
hole
above
and
at
the
tiny
door
behind
the
only
light
in
the
big
room
came
from
small
cooking
fires
scattered
about
the
place
and
for
the
moment
details
were
withheld
from
the
sight
then
they
found
themselves
in
what
seemed
a
labyrinth
of
poles
and
hammocks
through
this
confusion
yuara
passed
with
familiar
step
and
in
his
wake
the
travelers
went
to
a
central
fire
around
which
was
a
comparatively
clear
space
beyond
in
a
big
hammock
dyed
with
the
symbolic
scarlet
and
black
and
tasseled
with
many
squirrel
tails
sat
a
fat
man
whose
elaborate
feather
dress
and
authoritative
air
proclaimed
him
chief
beside
him
stood
rana
and
another
subchief
lean
and
behind
this
bulwark
of
tribal
might
huddled
the
women
and
children
staring
as
the
visitors
stopped
and
returned
the
chief
unwinking
regard
the
warriors
packed
themselves
at
their
backs
blocking
all
chance
of
exit
when
the
shuffle
of
feet
had
died
and
no
sound
was
audible
yuara
began
to
talk
in
his
deliberate
way
he
told
the
complete
narrative
of
his
journey
which
previously
he
had
sketched
only
in
outline
his
three
companions
corroborated
his
tale
from
time
to
time
by
nods
and
when
the
discovery
of
the
slain
hunter
bones
was
described
one
of
those
three
stepped
forward
and
laid
the
dead
man
weapons
on
the
ground
before
the
chief
as
yuara
went
on
he
touched
his
bandaged
arm
and
pointed
to
mckay
and
knowlton
and
as
he
concluded
he
motioned
toward
lourenço
ignorant
of
the
indian
language
but
guessing
the
nature
of
his
talk
from
his
motions
the
americans
stood
patiently
awaiting
the
next
move
for
a
time
all
three
of
the
chiefs
remained
silent
but
all
of
them
studied
mckay
standing
bolt
upright
with
arms
folded
and
the
knife
partly
concealed
in
the
hollow
of
one
elbow
though
it
was
evident
that
yuara
had
given
the
captain
full
credit
for
saving
his
life
the
faces
of
the
head
men
showed
no
sign
of
friendliness
in
fact
their
expressions
were
distinctly
ominous
at
length
the
chief
turned
his
eyes
to
lourenço
the
veteran
bushman
promptly
stepped
forward
and
said
his
say
at
the
end
he
turned
took
from
mckay
the
knife
unrolled
the
belt
and
dangled
the
weapon
before
the
eyes
of
the
rulers
they
stared
at
it
in
obvious
ignorance
of
its
character
not
until
the
brazilian
drew
the
blade
from
its
sheath
and
the
glint
of
steel
struck
their
vision
did
they
show
recognition
then
chief
suba
grunted
his
little
eyes
lit
up
and
he
reached
for
it
for
a
few
minutes
he
sat
gloating
over
the
gift
admiring
the
bone
handle
hefting
the
weight
of
the
long
blade
while
the
subchiefs
gazed
in
envy
when
he
looked
up
his
face
was
beaming
but
then
the
subchief
at
his
left
hand
muttered
something
and
suba
visage
darkened
his
eyes
rested
again
on
mckay
went
to
the
bandaged
arm
of
yuara
dropped
to
his
knife
the
first
steel
knife
ever
owned
by
him
or
any
man
of
the
suba
tribe
and
rose
again
to
the
captain
abruptly
then
he
spoke
out
lourenço
stared
in
blank
astonishment
after
a
puzzled
moment
he
shook
his
head
as
if
unable
to
believe
he
had
heard
aright
suba
scowling
repeated
what
he
had
said
lourenço
shook
his
head
again
this
time
in
vehement
denial
and
began
to
talk
but
suba
rising
with
surprising
agility
for
a
man
of
his
weight
stopped
him
imperiously
and
spoke
with
finality
slowly
the
brazilian
nodded
and
turned
to
his
captain
i
do
not
understand
this
capitao
but
these
are
the
words
of
the
chief
white
man
with
the
black
beard
tries
a
trick
but
it
does
not
deceive
the
free
men
of
the
forest
the
thing
which
he
thinks
to
be
hidden
in
his
own
heart
is
known
to
suba
and
his
chiefs
it
is
known
also
to
the
chief
monitaya
and
to
his
chiefs
and
to
his
men
also
the
white
man
is
bold
and
now
his
own
boldness
shall
be
his
death
the
white
man
has
said
he
goes
to
visit
the
chief
monitaya
and
since
by
some
demon
power
the
white
man
has
saved
the
life
of
yuara
who
is
a
man
of
suba
the
men
of
suba
will
allow
him
to
go
in
peace
from
this
place
but
suba
will
see
that
he
and
his
companions
go
to
monitaya
who
will
know
how
to
deal
with
his
visitors
the
men
of
suba
will
take
the
strangers
at
once
to
the
canoes
and
carry
them
to
monitaya
the
white
man
of
the
black
beard
and
the
black
mind
thought
the
men
of
the
jungle
blind
to
the
foulness
he
would
do
here
he
is
a
fool
it
is
useless
for
him
or
his
men
to
lie
and
say
they
know
not
what
suba
means
let
him
look
into
his
own
heart
and
he
will
know
well
has
spoken
something
is
wrong
capitao
but
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
it
will
do
no
good
to
argue
let
us
go
at
once

snarled
commands
to
the
warriors
they
trooped
toward
the
door
without
another
word
or
glance
at
the
three
chiefs
lourenço
stalked
after
the
indians
and
his
comrades
followed
with
stiff
dignity
outside
the
savages
picked
up
the
rifles
and
packs
and
carried
them
to
the
creek
where
small
canoes
lay
the
five
strangers
were
allowed
to
crowd
themselves
together
in
a
canoe
but
their
guns
and
packs
were
distributed
among
four
other
dugouts
into
which
armed
paddlers
entered
other
indians
brought
provisions
to
the
outgoing
craft
in
a
very
short
time
the
leading
canoe
started
off
downstream
followed
by
the
boat
of
the
white
men
behind
which
the
other
craft
pressed
close
and
vigilant
they
swung
in
among
the
trees
and
the
of
suba
was
blotted
out

have
our
machetes
yet
i
believe
lourenço
words
to
the
chief
monitaya
will
make
all
well
but
i
can
not
help
wondering
he
glanced
at
mckay
i
wondering
too
pedro
said
the
captain
it
hardly
possible
that
these
people
know
why
we
here
and
hardly
likely
that
they
have
any
interest
in
the
raposa
lord
knows
i
nothing
else
up
my
sleeve
it
a
riddle
to
me
it
remained
a
riddle
to
the
rest
for
no
explanation
could
be
gleaned
from
the
mayorunas
at
the
first
halt
which
did
not
come
until
nearly
sundown
the
americans
discovered
that
one
of
the
men
in
the
fore
canoe
was
yuara
who
had
been
lying
in
the
bottom
of
the
craft
and
sleeping
all
the
afternoon
from
him
lourenço
attempted
to
get
information
as
to
the
reason
for
suba
enmity
but
in
vain
the
tall
fellow
spoke
not
a
word
in
reply
and
his
face
remained
unreadable
camp
was
made
and
by
yuara
direction
the
packs
of
the
adventurers
were
restored
to
them
the
rifles
however
remained
under
guard
of
savages
appointed
by
the
subchief
son
when
the
night
meal
was
out
of
the
way
nothing
remained
but
to
seek
hammocks
and
sleep
for
further
attempts
at
conversation
by
lourenço
met
with
the
same
silent
rebuff
from
every
cannibal
addressed
none
showed
active
hostility
by
either
look
or
manner
but
it
was
plain
that
between
wild
and
civilized
men
stood
a
wall
a
wall
not
too
high
for
the
jungle
dwellers
to
leap
over
in
deadly
action
if
occasion
should
be
given
wherefore
the
whites
held
themselves
aloof
said
little
and
slept
early
i
am
glad
yuara
is
with
us
lourenço
said
as
he
promised
he
does
not
forget
what
was
done
for
him
he
will
keep
this
band
in
control
and
unless
i
am
much
mistaken
he
will
tell
monitaya
all
he
knows
of
us
which
surely
will
not
do
us
any
harm
at
any
rate
we
can
sleep
in
safety
and
since
it
does
no
good
to
puzzle
about
what
is
gone
by
or
to
worry
about
what
has
not
yet
to
come
to
pass
let
us
sleep
now
yawned
tim
renzo
ye
spill
more
solid
sense
to
the
square
inch
than
any
feller
i
seen
in
a
long
time
we
here
because
here
dead
and
ai
born
yet
and
timmy
ryan
hits
the
hay
right
now
night
gents
so
surrounded
by
man
eaters
the
trailers
of
the
raposa
slept
far
more
securely
than
on
any
night
down
the
river
when
their
companions
had
been
supposedly
civilized
peruvians
whether
a
watch
was
kept
by
their
guards
during
the
night
they
neither
knew
nor
cared
since
they
had
no
intention
of
attempting
escape
they
awoke
to
find
the
men
of
suba
diminished
in
number
by
half
yuara
deigning
to
speak
for
the
first
time
since
leaving
the
explained
that
the
absent
men
had
gone
hunting
for
their
breakfasts
before
long
the
hunters
came
straggling
back
bearing
monkeys
and
birds
which
were
divided
among
their
companions
none
of
this
meat
was
offered
to
the
prisoners
who
ate
unconcernedly
from
their
pack
rations
tim
after
watching
the
indians
sink
their
teeth
into
broiled
monkey
haunches
and
tear
the
meat
from
the
bones
snorted
and
turned
his
back
to
them
look
like
a
gang
o
devils
gobblin
babies
he
muttered
i
believe
now
they
cannibals
all
right
so
uncomfortably
apt
was
his
simile
that
the
others
grimaced
and
turned
their
eyes
elsewhere
until
the
savage
meal
was
finished
then
their
attention
became
riveted
on
a
queer
proceeding
at
the
canoe
wherein
yuara
had
journeyed
yesterday
to
the
gunwales
amidships
two
of
the
men
fastened
a
couple
of
small
crotched
posts
in
the
forks
was
laid
a
pole
crosswise
of
the
boat
and
from
this
by
slender
fiber
cords
four
slabs
of
wood
were
hung
strolling
down
to
the
canoe
the
travelers
found
that
athwart
its
bottom
had
been
laid
a
crosspiece
supporting
two
shorter
crotched
posts
between
which
stretched
another
transverse
pole
and
from
this
pole
in
turn
the
lower
ends
of
the
four
slabs
had
been
suspended
now
the
savages
joined
the
tips
of
each
pair
of
slabs
by
carved
end
sections
and
the
contrivance
seemed
to
be
complete
a
sort
of
grate
its
bars
sloping
at
an
angle
of
degrees
as
the
americans
eyed
the
arrangement
in
perplexity
one
of
the
crew
picked
up
from
the
bow
of
the
canoe
a
pair
of
mallets
the
heads
of
which
were
wrapped
in
hide
with
these
he
struck
the
slabs
in
rapid
succession
out
rolled
four
notes
of
astonishing
volume
the
first
four
notes
of
the
musical
scale
again
and
again
he
ran
them
over
then
stopped
the
deep
tones
thrummed
away
along
the
creek
and
died
by
george
a
big
xylophone
knowlton
exclaimed
admiringly
it
sure
talks
right
out
loud
said
tim
lot
o
class
to
these
guys
at
that
bet
this
is
their
brass
band
and
we
go
into
the
next
town
like
we
was
on
parade
oughter
have
some
flags
to
hang
up
in
the
boats
and
mebbe
a
drum
corps
to
help
out
wisht
i
had
a
tin
whistle
or
somethin
and
i
join
the
orchester
i
can
toot
a
whistle
fine
my
favorite
instrument
is
the
dinner
horn
laughed
knowlton
but
i
think
you
wrong
this
is
some
kind
of
signaling
apparatus
you
have
it
right
senhor
lourenço
affirmed
i
have
heard
this
sort
of
thing
used
though
i
never
before
saw
the
instrument
itself
those
notes
will
carry
at
least
five
miles
and
the
cannibals
send
messages
by
striking
the
bars
in
different
order
this
run
which
we
have
just
heard
is
always
used
first
and
no
message
is
sent
until
a
reply
is
received
bush
telegraph
nodded
mckay
first
call
your
operator
and
then
shoot
the
message
in
code
pretty
ingenious
for
a
bunch
of
absolute
savages
lourenço
turned
to
yuara
and
asked
a
question
yuara
curtly
replied
he
says
capitao
that
this
is
to
tell
monitaya
we
come
but
we
now
are
too
far
off
for
monitaya
men
to
hear
the
bars
are
made
ready
before
starting
so
that
they
can
be
used
as
soon
as
we
are
within
hearing
he
says
also
that
we
start
now
the
mayorunas
already
were
entering
their
canoes
with
cool
deliberation
the
whites
gathered
up
their
equipment
and
settled
themselves
for
the
journey
at
whose
end
lay
either
life
or
death
the
boat
of
yuara
started
and
once
more
the
flotilla
was
on
its
way
for
an
hour
or
more
it
swung
on
among
the
forested
hills
before
the
telegraph
instrument
was
put
to
use
then
it
paused
and
the
sonorous
voice
of
the
xylophone
spoke
to
the
jungle
a
period
of
waiting
brought
no
reply
the
canoe
moved
on
for
a
mile
again
the
mallets
beat
the
wood
in
the
ascending
scale
of
the
call
and
then
faint
mellow
far
off
sounded
the
answer
while
every
man
sat
silent
the
bars
boomed
out
their
fateful
news
slow
brief
deep
as
a
bell
tolling
a
dirge
a
reply
rolled
back
and
with
the
solemnity
of
a
funeral
cortége
the
canoes
once
more
moved
on
unhurried
inexorable
the
measured
swing
of
the
paddles
beating
like
a
pulse
of
doom
at
length
the
crew
of
yuara
held
their
paddles
yuara
himself
turned
toward
the
second
canoe
and
talked
a
minute
a
signal
to
his
men
and
his
boat
proceeded
all
the
others
remained
where
they
were
he
goes
to
monitaya
to
speak
of
us
said
lourenço
he
will
return
we
have
only
to
wait
yeah
grunted
tim
disgustedly
we
wait
till
night
if
he
takes
as
long
to
go
through
his
rigmarole
as
he
done
yesterday
if
i
got
to
fight
i
want
to
hop
to
it
not
set
round
in
the
shade
o
the
shelterin
palm
while
them
guys
are
heatin
up
the
stewpot
this
waitin
stuff
gits
my
goat
you
might
sing
us
a
song
senhor
to
pass
the
time
pedro
suggested
with
a
smile
say
i
do
that
jest
to
show
these
guys
i
do
give
a
rip
and
while
their
ears
are
dazzled
by
me
melody
i
goin
to
git
me
holster
unbottoned
and
me
masheet
kinder
limbered
up
git
set
here
it
comes
ol
hindyburg
thought
he
was
swell
he
made
the
kids
in
belgium
yell
but
the
yanks
come
over
with
shot
and
shell
and
hindyburg
he
run
like
hell
under
cover
of
his
outbreak
which
made
the
savages
clutch
their
weapons
and
glare
at
him
in
mingled
suspicion
and
amazement
there
proceeded
a
furtive
loosening
of
pistols
and
machetes
a
noble
sentiment
and
more
or
less
appropriate
grinned
knowlton
but
do
give
them
another
spasm
for
a
few
minutes
or
they
may
rise
up
and
kill
us
all
in
they
on
the
ragged
edge
now
aw
them
guys
dunno
how
to
appreciate
good
singin
but
i
should
worry
i
got
me
gat
fixed
now
like
i
want
it
time
dragged
past
the
americans
and
brazilians
smoked
and
exchanged
casual
comments
on
subjects
far
removed
from
their
present
environment
the
mayorunas
watched
them
with
unceasing
vigilance
as
if
expecting
a
sudden
break
for
life
and
liberty
their
chief
had
intimated
that
monitaya
would
kill
these
men
and
now
was
their
last
chance
to
try
to
dodge
death
but
neither
the
mckay
nor
any
of
his
mates
manifested
the
slightest
concern
and
at
last
the
canoe
of
yuara
came
back
it
came
however
without
yuara
himself
the
son
of
rana
had
remained
at
the
ahead
whence
he
sent
the
command
to
advance
closely
hemmed
in
by
the
men
of
suba
the
white
men
boat
surged
onward
at
a
brisk
pace
around
a
bend
in
the
creek
it
went
and
at
once
the
domain
of
monitaya
leaped
into
view
two
big
tribal
houses
each
considerably
larger
than
the
one
of
suba
rose
pompously
in
a
wide
cleared
space
beside
the
stream
before
them
ranged
in
a
semicircle
stood
hundreds
of
mayorunas
men
women
children
all
silently
watching
the
canoes
of
the
newcomers
in
the
center
of
the
arc
like
the
hub
of
a
human
half
wheel
a
small
knot
of
men
waited
in
aloof
dignity
four
of
them
adorned
with
the
ornate
feather
dresses
of
subchiefs
backed
by
a
dozen
tall
muscular
savages
each
armed
with
a
huge
war
club
before
all
stood
a
powerful
magnificently
proportioned
savage
belted
with
a
wide
girdle
of
squirrel
tails
decked
with
necklaces
of
jaguar
teeth
and
ebony
nuts
crowned
by
plumes
which
in
loftiness
and
splendor
surpassed
all
other
headgear
present
the
great
chief
monitaya
at
the
shore
beside
a
row
of
empty
canoes
yuara
was
waiting
he
mentioned
for
his
men
to
bring
their
dugouts
to
the
regular
landing
place
and
when
they
obeyed
he
gave
commands
then
he
turned
and
walked
toward
monitaya
i
go
stated
lourenço
rising
you
stay
here
until
called
yuara
has
told
his
men
to
leave
all
weapons
in
the
canoes
he
walked
away
after
the
son
of
rana
and
if
any
misgiving
was
in
his
heart
it
did
not
show
in
his
confident
step
halting
before
the
big
chief
he
began
talking
as
coolly
as
if
there
were
not
the
least
doubt
of
welcome
for
himself
and
those
with
him
monitaya
gave
no
sign
of
recognition
of
friendliness
or
of
enmity
proud
statuesque
he
stood
motionless
his
deep
eyes
resting
on
those
of
the
brazilian
sultry
weather
remarked
mckay
just
so
capitao
agreed
pedro
narrow
eyed
we
shall
soon
know
whether
we
shall
have
storm
indications
are
for
violent
thunder
and
lightning
soon
knowlton
contributed
see
those
husky
clubmen
awaiting
looks
as
if
a
public
execution
were
about
to
be
pulled
off
yeah
but
say
ai
that
chief
a
though
no
fathead
like
that
there
now
suby
guy
hope
i
do
have
to
drill
him
i
bet
i
wo
neither
he
looks
like
he
had
brains
hoping
tim
was
right
but
dubious
all
watched
the
progress
of
the
parley
lourenço
evidently
was
stating
his
case
in
logical
sequence
recalling
to
the
chief
mind
the
time
when
he
had
led
him
to
revenge
against
the
peccaries
of
peru
then
going
on
to
tell
of
the
arrival
of
the
strangers
and
the
object
of
their
search
yuara
sudden
quick
glance
at
him
showed
that
the
raposa
had
been
mentioned
for
the
first
time
a
little
later
his
face
became
slightly
sullen
and
the
watchers
guessed
that
lourenço
was
now
referring
in
somewhat
uncomplimentary
terms
to
the
treatment
received
in
the
of
suba
soon
after
that
the
brazilian
ended
his
speech
in
a
deep
quiet
tone
monitaya
spoke
first
to
lourenço
then
to
one
of
his
subchiefs
the
bushman
beckoned
to
his
waiting
companions
at
the
same
time
the
subchief
stepped
out
and
called
two
names
as
mckay
knowlton
tim
and
pedro
arose
and
stepped
ashore
with
the
weaponless
men
of
suba
out
from
the
great
human
arc
came
two
men
all
advanced
toward
the
chief
and
though
the
americans
were
studying
the
central
figures
as
they
walked
they
also
noticed
that
the
pair
of
mayorunas
who
had
been
summoned
were
lame
one
walked
with
a
stiff
knee
the
other
as
if
a
whole
leg
was
paralyzed
squad
halt
muttered
mckay
a
step
and
a
half
and
the
four
stood
aligned
and
alert
two
strides
from
monitaya
the
eyes
of
the
chief
dwelt
long
on
mckay
and
they
were
hard
eyes
without
shifting
his
gaze
he
grunted
a
few
words
the
two
crippled
indians
stumped
forward
and
stared
into
mckay
face
through
a
long
minute
the
americans
felt
a
sinister
tension
grow
in
the
air
about
them
then
slowly
the
cripples
turned
about
and
faced
their
ruler
in
the
tones
of
men
sure
of
themselves
they
spoke
one
word
with
the
utterance
of
that
word
the
tension
broke
through
the
long
line
of
watching
tribesmen
ran
a
murmur
the
clubmen
relaxed
from
their
ready
poise
the
subchiefs
glanced
at
one
another
as
if
disappointed
and
the
stern
face
of
monitaya
himself
was
transformed
by
a
wide
friendly
smile
a
sweeping
gesture
and
the
cordial
timbre
of
the
chief
voice
told
the
americans
plainly
what
lourenço
translated
a
moment
later
we
are
welcome
comrades
we
shall
sleep
in
the
of
monitaya
himself
and
a
feast
shall
be
made
for
us
our
lives
have
just
hung
on
one
word
but
now
that
the
word
is
spoken
we
are
safe
i
can
not
tell
you
more
now
for
i
do
not
wholly
understand
this
matter
myself
as
yet
but
i
shall
learn
now
is
the
time
capitao
to
give
presents
if
you
have
any
for
the
chief
i
have
but
our
packs
are
in
the
canoe
and
i
be
hanged
if
i
make
a
beast
of
burden
of
myself
at
this
stage
of
the
game
i
will
have
all
the
packs
brought
up
capitao
the
men
of
suba
took
them
from
us
at
their
now
they
shall
restore
them
before
all
these
people
he
addressed
monitaya
affably
then
spoke
more
brusquely
to
yuara
that
young
man
whose
previous
austerity
now
had
dissolved
into
open
friendliness
uttered
four
words
immediately
his
men
returned
to
the
canoes
and
brought
up
not
only
the
packs
but
the
rifles
from
his
blanket
roll
mckay
brought
forth
a
package
out
of
which
he
drew
a
its
blade
gleaming
dully
under
a
protective
coating
of
grease
which
he
swiftly
swabbed
off
from
his
haversack
he
produced
a
heavy
chain
of
beads
under
the
bright
sun
the
beads
glowed
like
living
things
and
the
glittering
steel
flashed
back
a
dazzling
beam
the
two
gifts
together
had
cost
considerably
less
than
ten
dollars
in
new
york
but
to
the
chieftain
they
were
priceless
treasures
and
as
mckay
with
a
formal
bow
extended
them
to
him
his
face
shone
with
delight
yet
he
made
no
such
greedy
grab
for
them
as
had
been
displayed
by
suba
when
tendered
the
knife
his
acceptance
was
achieved
with
a
calm
dignity
which
brought
a
twinkle
of
approval
to
the
eyes
of
the
white
men
in
the
same
dignified
manner
he
led
the
way
to
the
which
evidently
was
the
older
of
the
two
and
which
had
always
been
his
home
the
semicircle
of
his
subjects
broke
up
into
a
disorderly
crowd
which
streamed
after
him
and
his
guests
or
surrounded
the
men
of
suba
with
holiday
greetings
within
the
tribal
house
the
adventurers
proceeded
to
the
central
space
where
burned
the
chief
fire
there
monitaya
ordered
certain
hammocks
removed
to
make
room
for
those
of
the
visitors
soon
the
travelers
were
seated
at
ease
in
their
hanging
beds
their
packs
and
rifles
lying
on
the
ground
beneath
them
while
near
at
hand
clustered
groups
of
mayorunas
staring
at
them
in
naïve
curiosity
pedro
drew
a
long
breath
senhores
that
was
a
very
close
call
he
declared
as
lourenço
says
our
lives
have
hung
on
one
word
what
was
that
word
comrade
the
word
was
answered
lourenço
monitaya
asked
those
two
crippled
men
this
the
man
as
you
saw
they
looked
at
the
capitao
giving
no
attention
to
the
rest
of
us
then
they
said
you
will
remember
that
the
capitao
was
the
one
whom
suba
also
picked
upon
as
soon
as
monitaya
finishes
talking
with
those
men
i
shall
ask
him
what
all
this
means
the
big
chief
was
giving
directions
to
a
score
of
young
fellows
who
presently
scattered
to
various
parts
of
the
house
and
accoutered
themselves
for
hunting
thereupon
lourenço
approached
monitaya
with
the
familiarity
of
former
acquaintance
being
received
with
a
smile
for
a
time
the
two
conversed
as
they
talked
the
smile
of
the
ruler
faded
and
his
face
grew
dark
while
into
the
brazilian
voice
came
a
wrathful
growl
finally
both
nodded
lourenço
returned
to
his
hammock
frowning
capitao
it
is
all
because
of
your
black
hair
and
beard
through
all
the
of
the
mayorunas
far
and
near
has
gone
the
word
to
watch
for
a
big
man
who
is
neither
a
brazilian
nor
a
peruvian
but
of
some
country
unknown
to
these
people
and
when
such
a
man
is
caught
to
kill
him
and
his
companions
without
mercy
and
the
reason
for
such
a
command
is
this
for
many
moons
the
mayorunas
especially
those
of
the
smaller
and
weaker
have
been
losing
women
from
time
to
time
sudden
raids
have
been
made
by
gangs
of
peruvian
indians
and
who
shot
down
the
defenders
of
the
houses
before
they
could
reach
their
weapons
and
carried
off
girls
this
of
course
is
nothing
new
here
for
such
things
have
happened
occasionally
for
many
years
but
within
the
past
five
years
there
has
been
a
difference
in
these
attacks
which
has
made
them
much
more
deadly
these
raids
used
to
be
made
always
at
night
and
they
were
few
and
far
between
but
of
late
they
have
come
about
also
in
the
day
at
times
when
almost
all
the
men
of
the
small
were
far
out
in
the
forest
hunting
meat
and
the
women
had
little
protection
several
chiefs
have
been
killed
by
the
raiders
who
seemed
to
be
acting
according
to
an
agreed
plan
to
be
organized
for
this
work
and
to
know
when
to
strike
and
how
to
get
away
quickly
and
what
is
more
the
men
who
did
this
were
not
chance
parties
who
came
only
to
get
women
for
themselves
and
then
stayed
away
the
same
men
came
back
time
after
time
a
few
of
these
were
killed
but
only
a
few
and
all
the
dead
were
peruvians
being
dead
they
could
tell
nothing
but
the
mayorunas
felt
that
all
these
raids
were
directed
by
one
mind
and
they
became
sure
of
this
when
one
captured
girl
escaped
by
killing
a
peruvian
with
his
own
knife
and
returned
to
her
own
she
said
the
raiders
took
her
and
the
other
girls
to
the
big
man
with
the
black
beard
who
waited
at
a
safe
place
a
day
march
from
the
tribal
house
a
few
weeks
later
another
small
several
miles
from
here
was
attacked
at
night
while
two
men
of
monitaya
were
there
having
stayed
out
too
late
on
a
hunting
trip
and
taken
refuge
with
their
neighbors
until
day
both
these
men
were
hit
and
crippled
by
bullets
in
the
wild
shooting
that
opened
the
attack
one
was
struck
in
the
knee
the
other
in
the
lower
part
of
the
back
but
both
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
face
and
saw
that
he
was
the
man
himself
so
you
see
capitao
why
we
have
been
near
death
suba
and
monitaya
both
thought
you
were
the
man
we
were
lucky
to
escape
alive
from
suba
and
still
more
lucky
that
hero
were
two
men
who
knew
the
face
of
the
blackbeard
schwandorf
barked
mckay
yes
capitao
it
must
be
the
german
i
know
it
schwandorf
and
i
know
his
game
he
a
slaver
a
slaver
that
it
knew
i
seen
that
sneak
before
he
worked
the
same
game
in
british
guiana
eight
years
ago
on
a
small
scale
had
a
gang
of
tough
bush
niggers
from
over
in
dutch
guiana
to
do
his
dirty
work
stole
macusi
girls
they
the
indians
in
and
sold
them
like
cattle
to
gold
miners
cleaned
up
quite
a
pot
before
the
english
got
on
to
him
but
had
to
get
out
of
the
country
on
the
hot
foot
have
time
to
take
his
gold
with
him
his
name
was
schwandorf
over
there
and
he
had
no
beard
he
was
thinner
too
and
posed
as
a
russian
but
he
the
man
must
have
made
his
by
the
back
door
down
the
branco
to
the
amazon
now
he
running
mayoruna
girls
into
peru
he
could
sell
them
to
rubber
men
or
miners
and
make
good
money
eh
lourenço
sure
and
that
why
he
wanted
to
kill
off
his
peruvians
they
knew
too
much
probably
were
trying
to
bleed
him
for
hush
money
he
must
have
a
regular
slave
route
and
a
gang
of
border
cutthroats
to
do
his
raiding

who
do
go

murderer
slaver
wonder
how
many
other
crimes
are
on
his

them
two
are
enough
growled
tim
and
he
got
no
soul
no
soul
echoed
pedro
you
have
said
it
senhor
tim
and
if
ever
these
people
capture
him
he
soon
will
have
no
body
chapter
xvii
fever
in
the
of
monitaya
a
feast
was
in
the
making
fires
glowed
all
about
the
great
room
hunters
came
in
bearing
birds
or
beasts
which
were
placed
before
the
tribal
ruler
for
inspection
and
approval
fishermen
armed
with
tridents
or
crude
harpoons
arrived
with
sizable
trophies
of
their
skill
and
at
length
two
young
bowmen
advanced
proudly
with
a
freshly
killed
wild
hog
after
glancing
at
this
the
chief
added
to
his
usual
nod
a
few
words
of
praise
which
made
the
huntsmen
grin
with
all
their
pointed
teeth
lourenço
squatting
comfortably
on
a
jaguar
skin
beside
the
lavishly
decorated
hammock
of
monitaya
carried
on
a
monologue
which
probably
dealt
with
his
various
experiences
since
his
last
meeting
with
these
people
and
which
appeared
to
interest
and
amuse
the
chief
the
others
lolling
back
in
mingled
fatigue
and
relief
from
tension
studied
the
interior
of
the
place
and
watched
the
activities
around
them
as
in
the
of
suba
the
small
forest
of
poles
and
hammocks
seemed
a
maze
wherein
was
neither
beginning
nor
end
yet
as
the
newcomers
took
time
to
observe
it
they
presently
found
that
the
confusion
was
only
apparent
and
that
there
existed
an
efficient
and
orderly
arrangement
the
hammocks
seemingly
slung
from
any
available
pair
of
poles
in
utter
disregard
of
one
another
really
were
arranged
in
triangles
on
the
ground
under
the
hanging
beds
lay
woven
grass
mats
and
hides
of
the
sloth
and
the
jaguar
and
in
the
space
inclosed
by
each
trio
of
hammocks
burned
a
small
fire
the
hammocks
were
the
beds
of
men
the
mats
and
furs
the
couches
of
women
and
children
and
each
fire
was
the
focal
point
of
the
family
residing
in
that
triangle
above
the
hammocks
from
transverse
poles
were
suspended
the
weapons
of
the
men
the
great
bows
the
long
blowguns
the
fighting
spears
whose
deadly
points
now
were
sheathed
in
thick
scabbards
of
grass
the
unpoisoned
fish
spears
and
harpoons
from
these
poles
also
hung
the
quivers
of
arrows
and
darts
and
the
small
pouches
wherein
a
little
fresh
poison
was
carried
by
warrior
or
hunter
thus
both
the
ground
and
the
air
were
utilized
and
by
the
compactness
of
the
arrangement
an
entire
family
with
its
worldly
goods
was
enabled
to
live
in
a
comparatively
small
space
looking
around
the
wide
room
and
remembering
the
big
half
circle
of
indians
who
had
stood
outside
the
two
estimated
that
in
this
tribal
house
and
its
twin
dwelt
seven
hundred
people
tim
and
pedro
less
interested
in
the
mayoruna
domestic
economy
than
in
the
mayorunas
themselves
were
scanning
the
figures
moving
about
in
the
reddish
haze
of
smoke
most
of
them
were
women
all
nude
and
naïvely
unconscious
of
any
need
of
clothing
like
the
men
of
the
tribe
they
bore
the
red
and
black
rings
and
streaks
on
face
and
body
but
unlike
the
males
each
wore
a
facial
ornament
in
the
shape
of
an
oval
piece
of
wood
thrust
through
the
lower
lip
from
time
to
time
those
near
by
glanced
up
from
their
work
and
gave
the
new
men
unmistakably
friendly
looks
particularly
several
young
but
girls
who
obviously
were
still
unmated
in
fact
these
last
smiled
openly
at
the
lithe
handsome
pedro
and
red
tim
was
by
no
means
overlooked
i
got
me
orders
said
tim
and
i
danged
if
i
crack
a
smile
back
at
them
girls
but
i
sure
feel
like
grinnin
watch
yourself
they
tryin
to
flirt
with
ye
pedro
mindful
of
watchful
eyes
turned
his
gaze
to
tim
face
before
allowing
himself
to
smile
then
he
laughed
do
not
fear
he
said
my
heart
is
still
my
own
same
here
specially
when
i
remember
these
females
would
grin
jest
the
same
if
them
club
swingers
had
spattered
our
brains
all
over
the
front
yard
awhile
back
but
i
wisht
sombody
give
the
girls
a
nightie
or
somethin
to
wear
i
been
around
some
and
i
seen
quite
a
lot
but
i
ai
used
to
bein
vamped
by
a
bunch
of
undressed
kids
with
eyes
the
size
of
a
plate
o
fish
balls
i
only
a
bashful
country
kid
from
live
and
learn
chuckled
pedro
and
clothes
really
have
nothing
to
do
with
modesty
true
for
ye
clothes
is
mostly
a
disguise
anyhow
specially
with
women
and
an
awful
expense
besides
these
guys
are
lucky
i
say
they
got
to
buy
their
wives
no
fur
coats
or
silk
stockin
or
nothin
all
the
same
i
got
all
i
can
do
to
hold
me
face
straight
when
i
see
these
givin
us
the
glad
look
i
oughter
stayed
back
in
remate
de
males
where
a
feller
can
wink
at
a
woman
without
gittin
all
his
pardners
massacreed
perhaps
it
would
not
be
fatal
now
that
we
are
guests
of
the
chief
but
it
is
best
to
take
no
chances
safety
first
that
us
grin
at
one
of
and
another
might
git
sore
because
she
missed
out
and
first
thing
ye
know
ye
started
without
meanin
to
let
look
at
somethin
harmless
one
o
them
poisoned
spears
instance
at
that
moment
monitaya
and
lourenço
both
arose
the
chief
to
inspect
in
person
the
progress
of
the
arrangements
for
the
feast
the
bushman
to
return
to
his
companions
with
additional
news
monitaya
tells
me
he
said
that
his
people
have
lost
girls
in
other
ways
than
by
the
murderous
attacks
of
the
gunmen
a
number
of
young
women
who
have
gone
into
the
bush
near
their
to
get
urucu
and
genipapa
which
they
use
to
make
the
red
and
black
body
dyes
have
disappeared
so
have
several
who
went
to
the
creeks
for
their
daily
baths
warriors
who
tried
to
trail
them
have
found
the
footprints
of
a
few
men
but
always
lost
them
at
water
the
girls
had
been
taken
away
in
canoes
even
this
tribe
of
monitaya
which
never
has
been
attacked
by
night
raiders
because
it
is
too
strong
has
not
been
safe
from
these
stealthy
woman
stealings
by
daylight
three
girls
have
been
taken
from
here
within
the
past
two
moons
and
others
have
disappeared
from
other
hm
and
schwandorf
has
been
here
recently
said
knowlton
no
it
must
be
that
he
has
agents
who
work
when
he
is
not
here
or
else
this
is
done
without
his
knowledge
i
have
told
monitaya
what
i
know
of
schwandorf
and
he
agrees
that
the
women
are
taken
as
slaves
i
have
also
told
him
that
when
we
return
down
the
river
we
shall
see
that
schwandorf
troubles
the
mayorunas
no
more
excellent
mckay
approved
have
you
asked
him
about
the
raposa
not
yet
it
does
not
pay
to
hurry
business
with
these
people
after
the
feast
is
out
of
the
way
i
will
talk
further
with
him
no
more
was
said
for
a
time
the
five
lounged
at
ease
sniffing
the
savory
odors
arising
from
the
reddish
clay
pots
and
pans
in
which
fruit
fish
or
fowl
was
frying
in
tapir
lard
or
meat
was
stewing
at
length
a
number
of
tall
shapely
women
apparently
the
handsomest
of
their
sex
in
the
tribe
laid
a
number
of
small
mats
in
a
semicircle
on
the
ground
before
the
chief
and
placed
thereon
a
steaming
array
of
edibles
furs
were
placed
outside
the
line
of
mats
from
somewhere
appeared
all
four
of
the
subchiefs
accompanied
by
yuara
thereupon
monitaya
with
a
smiling
nod
to
his
guests
squatted
within
the
arc
forthwith
the
visitors
advanced
in
a
body
disposed
themselves
comfortably
on
the
furs
and
assailed
the
viands
with
a
vigor
that
brought
a
delighted
grin
to
the
face
of
their
barbaric
host
fried
bananas
tender
fish
broiled
parrot
which
was
not
so
tender
a
thick
stew
of
somewhat
odorous
meat
seasoned
with
herbs
roast
wild
hog
and
other
things
at
whose
identity
the
whites
could
not
even
guess
all
were
chewed
and
washed
down
with
generous
draughts
of
a
rather
sour
liquid
resembling
beer
remembering
lourenço
previous
warning
each
man
took
care
not
to
slight
any
portion
of
the
meal
or
to
show
distaste
with
anything
whether
it
pleased
the
palate
or
not
throughout
the
feast
the
tall
women
hovered
near
bringing
fresh
supplies
whenever
a
dearth
of
any
edible
appeared
to
threaten
and
when
at
last
the
feasters
were
full
to
repletion
monitaya
himself
designated
what
he
considered
titbits
to
tempt
them
further
gosh
if
i
eat
any
more
i
bust
and
i
danged
if
i
bust
jest
to
satisfy
this
guy
asserted
tim
wherewith
he
put
one
hand
under
his
jaw
and
patted
his
stomach
with
the
other
signifying
that
he
was
filled
to
the
throat
pedro
lifted
his
elbows
dropped
his
jaw
and
made
motions
as
if
gasping
for
air
the
chieftain
grinned
widely
the
grin
became
a
chuckling
when
tim
after
a
vain
attempt
to
rise
lay
back
at
full
length
on
his
rug
and
begged
some
one
to
make
a
cigarette
guess
i
have
to
follow
tim
example
confessed
knowlton
and
he
too
stretched
out
pedro
and
lourenço
also
sprawled
back
mckay
after
glancing
around
compromised
with
his
dignity
by
leaning
on
one
elbow
the
subchiefs
and
yuara
with
slight
smiles
relaxed
in
various
postures
monitaya
alone
arose
not
without
some
difficulty
and
got
into
his
hammock
where
he
beamed
down
at
them
suppose
this
is
a
compliment
to
the
chief
smiled
mckay
he
thinks
he
has
eaten

to
pick
them
senhor
tim
they
pick
him
he
and
the
subchiefs
are
the
only
ones
who
can
take
more
than
one
wife
when
a
girl
wishes
to
become
the
wife
of
the
great
chief
or
of
a
subchief
she
works
for
months
making
feather
dresses
and
necklaces
and
hammocks
and
when
these
are
done
she
gives
them
all
to
him
if
he
likes
her
well
enough
he
accepts
the
gifts
and
allows
her
to
be
a
wife

she
flattered

wisht

like

feller

then
when
he
fixin
to

the

flat
for
some
other
guy
that
spent
his
dough
yet
i
goin
to
take
a
snooze
right
there
on
the
table
wake
me
up
somebody
when
the
next
mess
call
blows
and
with
no
further
ado
he
shut
his
eyes
and
drowsed
his
companions
lolled
for
some
time
smoking
and
watching
the
family
life
of
the
ordinary
members
of
the
tribe
nodding
now
and
then
to
some
young
fellow
but
ignoring
the
mischievous
glances
of
the
girls
monitaya
himself
lay
back
in
his
hammock
and
dozed
his
wives
stepping
nonchalantly
among
the
strangers
cleared
away
the
remnants
of
the
feast
by
the
simple
process
of
eating
them
then
they
carried
off
the
clay
vessels
for
another
hour
all
hands
rested
then
monitaya
sat
up
stretched
his
big
arms
looked
casually
around
the
house
to
see
that
all
was
well
and
smiled
down
at
his
guests
lourenço
rising
to
a
squat
began
a
new
conversation
after
a
while
he
turned
to
mckay
the
red
bones
and
the
mayorunas
are
neither
friendly
nor
hostile
toward
each
other
and
there
is
little
communication
between
them
he
reported
from
those
to
the
town
of
the
red
bones
is
a
journey
of
five
long
days
so
the
men
of
monitaya
hardly
ever
go
there
the
raposa
whom
we
seek
is
known
to
the
men
of
monitaya
but
he
never
has
come
here
to
the
tribal
houses
hunters
from
this
place
have
met
him
at
times
roving
the
wild
forests
and
some
of
the
younger
men
fear
him
as
the
bad
spirit
of
the
jungle
the
mayorunas
believe
in
two
spirits
or
demons
one
good
and
one
bad
and
the
bad
one
is
said
to
roam
the
wilderness
seeking
lone
wanderers
whom
he
kills
and
eats
the
people
sometimes
hear
this
demon
howling
at
night
in
the
dark
of
the
moon
so
the
young
men
have
thought
the
raposa
might
be
this
demon
and
have
avoided
him
it
would
do
no
good
to
try
to
kill
a
demon
and
it
would
only
make
their
own
deaths
more
sure
and
horrible
but
the
older
men
do
not
believe
this
they
say
the
wild
man
is
of
the
red
bone
people
and
that
the
reason
why
his
bones
are
marked
in
red
on
his
living
body
is
that
he
is
neither
alive
nor
dead
if
he
were
dead
his
body
would
be
thrown
into
the
water
and
left
there
until
his
bones
were
stripped
by
those
cannibal
fish
the
piranhas
and
then
the
bones
would
be
dyed
red
and
hung
up
in
his
hut
as
is
the
custom
among
those
people
if
he
were
alive
like
other
men
he
would
not
have
those
marks
on
his
body
but
would
wear
only
the
tribal
face
paint
the
bone
paint
on
him
is
a
sign
to
all
the
that
he
is
alive
but
dead
and
is
not
to
be
treated
like
other
men
crazy
exclaimed
knowlton
yes
i
think
that
is
it
his
body
lives
but
his
mind
is
dead
death
in
life
has
he
been
seen
lately
the
brazilian
repeated
the
question
in
the
indian
tongue
the
chief
looked
toward
a
certain
hammock
some
distance
off
called
a
name
raised
an
imperative
hand
a
slender
savage
came
forward
to
him
the
chief
spoke
then
to
lourenço
who
as
usual
relayed
his
information
this
young
hunter
saw
him
six
days
ago
while
following
a
trail
far
out
in
the
bush
toward
the
red
bone
region
he
came
on
the
fresh
track
of
a
man
who
was
following
the
same
hogs
and
later
he
caught
up
with
that
man
it
was
the
wild
man
and
the
wild
man
was
very
lame
having
a
hurt
foot
they
stood
and
looked
at
each
other
and
then
the
wild
man
walked
away
watching
him
closely
and
ready
to
shoot
with
his
bow
after
he
disappeared
in
the
forest
this
hunter
heard
a
long
shrill
laugh
and
words
that
sounded
like
podavi
poor
davy
ejaculated
knowlton
that
he
sure
enough
then
he
near
his
own
town
now
he
wo
go
far
with
a
bad
foot
we
better
move
as
soon
as
we
can
ask
about
an
escort
once
more
the
bushman
conversed
with
monitaya
the
ruler
smile
disappeared
for
some
time
he
sat
gazing
out
over
the
heads
of
all
evidently
weighing
matters
in
his
mind
when
he
responded
however
it
was
without
hesitation
there
is
neither
friendliness
nor
enmity
between
the
two
peoples
as
has
been
said
lourenço
stated
our
business
among
the
red
bones
is
our
own
affair
not
that
of
monitaya
and
monitaya
will
make
no
requests
for
us
but
in
order
that
we
may
go
safely
and
return
without
harm
he
will
send
with
us
twenty
of
his
best
men
these
men
will
have
orders
to
protect
us
at
all
times
unless
fighting
is
caused
by
our
making
a
needless
attack
on
the
red
bones
in
that
case
the
mayorunas
will
do
nothing
to
help
us
they
will
only
defend
themselves
fair
enough
nodded
mckay
tell
him
we
start
no
fight
if
any
trouble
comes
it
will
be
from
the
other
fellows
we
leave
here
morning
lourenço
translated
the
promise
into
mayoruna
but
the
chief
seemed
not
to
hear
his
eyes
had
narrowed
and
were
fixed
on
the
face
of
tim
who
still
lay
on
his
back
and
was
giving
no
attention
to
what
went
on
following
his
look
the
bushman
gazed
critically
at
the
man
tim
florid
face
had
paled
his
mouth
was
drawn
and
his
eyes
stared
straight
up
wide
and
glassy
slowly
he
rolled
his
head
from
side
to
side
gee
cap
he
whispered
hoarsely
i
et
too
much
my
head
aches
so
fair
blind
and
i
burnin
up
gim
me
some
water
with
a
swift
simultaneous
movement
mckay
and
knowlton
put
their
hands
on
his
forehead
lourenço
and
pedro
leaned
closer
and
peered
into
his
face
all
four
glanced
at
one
another
pedro
nodded
his
lips
silently
formed
one
dread
word
fever
chapter
xviii
fruit
of
the
trap
heavy
hypodermic
doses
of
quinine
aided
by
tim
rugged
constitution
and
the
fact
that
this
was
his
first
attack
of
the
ravaging
sickness
of
the
swamp
lands
pulled
him
back
to
safety
within
the
next
two
days
to
safety
but
not
to
strength
despite
his
assertions
that
he
was
ready
to
hit
the
trail
and
walk
the
legs
off
the
whole
danged
outfit
he
was
obviously
in
no
condition
to
stand
up
under
the
grueling
pack
work
that
lay
ahead
wherefore
mckay
after
consultation
with
the
others
of
the
party
and
through
lourenço
with
monitaya
gave
him
inflexible
orders
you
stay
here
stick
in
your
hammock
until
you
in
fighting
trim
then
watch
yourself
do
pull
any
bonehead
plays
that
get
these
people
down
on
you
take
quinine
daily
according
to
directions
he
written
them
on
the
box
if
we
not
back
in
a
fortnight
monitaya
will
send
men
to
find
out
why
if
they
find
that
we
not
coming
back
you
will
be
guided
to
the
river
where
you
can
get
down
to
the
nunes
place
but
cap
no
argument
but
listen
here
for
the
love
o
mike
i
ai
no
old
woman
i
can
stand
the
gaff
i
goin
with
the
gang
you
hear
the
orders
mckay
snapped
with
assumed
severity
think
we
want
to
be
bothered
with
having
you
go
sick
again
you
out
of
shape
and
we
no
room
for
lame
ducks
you
stay
here
tim
tried
another
tack
aw
but
listen
ye
ai
goin
to
desert
a
comrade
amongst
a
lot
o
man
eaters
right
in
the
place
where
i
got
sick
too
soon
i
git
away
from
here
i
be
all
right
that
stuff
no
good
the
captain
contradicted
with
a
tight
smile
you
did
get
fever
here
it
been
in
your
system
for
days
you
got
it
back
on
the
river
these
people
do
have
it
or
any
other
kind
of
sickness
i
looked
around
and
i
know
as
for
the
man
eaters
mighty
decent
folks
toward
friends
we
friends
you
be
under
the
personal
protection
of
monitaya
and
his
word
is
good
as
gold
it
all
arranged
and
you
safer
here
than
you
would
be
in
new
york
in
his
heart
the
stubborn
veteran
knew
mckay
was
right
but
like
any
other
good
soldier
ordered
to
remain
out
of
action
he
grumbled
and
growled
regardless
to
which
the
paid
about
as
much
attention
as
officers
usually
do
they
went
ahead
with
their
own
preparations
be
of
good
heart
senhor
tim
pedro
comforted
mischievously
you
will
not
lack
for
company
the
chief
has
appointed
two
girls
to
wait
upon
you
at
all
times
huh
them
two
tall
ones
that
been
hangin
round
and
fetchin
things
are
they
mine
yes
they
are
quite
handsome
in
their
way
and
strong
enough
to
help
you
about
if
your
legs
remain
weak
in
that
case
you
will
probably
be
allowed
to
put
your
arms
around
them
for
support
i
almost
wish
i
could
get
fever
too
tim
voice
remained
a
growl
but
his
face
did
not
look
so
doleful
as
before
grrrumph
i
always
seem
to
draw
big
females
and
i
do
like
gim
me
somethin
cute
like
them
frog
dolls
in
paree
sort
and
chick
still
a
feller
got
to
do
the
best
he
can
mebbe
i
live
till
you
guys
git
back
with
which
he
availed
himself
of
the
prerogative
of
a
sick
man
and
grinned
openly
at
the
two
comely
young
women
who
stood
near
at
hand
awaiting
any
demand
for
services
they
were
not
at
all
backward
in
reciprocating
and
despite
the
tribal
paint
and
their
labial
ornaments
the
smiles
softening
their
faces
made
them
not
half
bad
to
look
upon
death
where
is
thy
sting
laughed
knowlton
be
careful
not
to
strain
your
heart
while
we
away
tim
do
worry
it
a
tough
old
heart
been
kicked
round
so
much
growed
a
shell
like
a
turtle
besides
i
seen
wild
women
before
i
ever
come
to
the
jungle
notwithstanding
his
apparent
resignation
however
tim
erupted
once
more
when
his
comrades
shouldered
their
packs
picked
up
their
guns
and
spoke
their
thanks
and
to
monitaya
he
arose
on
shaky
legs
and
desperately
offered
to
prove
his
fitness
by
a
barehanded
bout
with
his
commanding
officer
when
mckay
with
sympathetic
eyes
but
gruff
tones
peremptorily
squelched
him
he
insisted
on
at
least
going
to
the
door
to
watch
his
comrades
start
the
journey
from
which
they
might
or
might
not
return
nor
did
he
take
advantage
of
his
chance
to
hug
the
girls
on
the
way
with
one
arm
slung
over
the
shoulders
of
a
wiry
young
warrior
who
grinned
proudly
at
the
honor
of
being
selected
to
help
a
guest
of
the
great
chief
he
followed
the
departing
column
out
into
the
sunshine
where
the
entire
tribe
was
assembled
and
when
the
stalwart
band
had
filed
into
the
shadows
of
the
trees
and
vanished
he
stood
for
a
time
unseeing
and
gulping
at
something
in
his
throat
straight
away
along
a
vague
path
beginning
at
the
rear
of
the
marched
the
the
two
northerners
bending
under
the
weight
of
their
packs
the
pair
of
brazilians
sweeping
the
jungle
with
practiced
eyes
the
score
of
mayorunas
striding
velvet
footed
resplendent
in
brilliant
new
paint
and
headdresses
armed
with
the
most
powerful
weapons
of
their
tribe
and
loftily
conscious
of
the
fact
that
they
were
chosen
as
monitaya
best
savage
and
civilized
each
man
was
fit
alert
formidable
nowhere
in
the
loosely
joined
chain
was
a
weak
link
before
the
departure
the
americans
had
been
at
some
trouble
to
rid
themselves
of
yuara
who
with
his
men
had
tarried
at
the
monitaya
during
tim
sickness
while
knowlton
was
giving
his
ripped
arm
a
final
dressing
he
had
calmly
announced
his
intention
of
joining
the
expedition
into
the
red
bone
country
and
it
had
taken
some
skillful
argument
by
lourenço
to
dissuade
him
without
arousing
his
anger
all
four
of
the
adventurers
would
gladly
have
taken
him
along
had
he
not
been
hampered
by
his
injury
but
under
the
ruthless
rule
barring
all
men
not
in
possession
of
all
their
strength
he
had
to
be
left
now
as
on
the
previous
jungle
marches
the
way
was
led
by
two
of
the
tribesmen
followed
by
the
brazilians
and
the
americans
after
whom
the
main
body
of
the
escort
strode
in
column
the
leader
and
guide
one
tucu
was
a
veteran
hunter
fighter
and
bushranger
who
had
been
more
than
once
in
the
red
bone
region
and
withal
possessed
the
cool
judgment
of
mature
years
and
long
experience
a
lean
silent
man
who
though
not
a
subchief
might
have
made
a
good
one
if
given
the
opportunity
with
him
lourenço
had
already
arranged
that
a
direct
course
should
be
followed
and
that
whenever
dense
undergrowth
blockaded
the
way
the
machete
men
should
take
the
lead
for
some
time
no
word
was
spoken
the
path
wound
on
faintly
marked
but
easy
enough
to
follow
with
tucu
picking
it
out
it
was
not
one
of
the
frequently
used
trails
of
the
monitaya
people
but
a
mere
or
hunter
track
yet
even
this
had
its
pitfalls
to
guard
the
tribal
house
soon
after
leaving
the
clearing
tucu
turned
aside
passed
between
trees
off
the
trail
went
directly
under
one
tree
whose
roots
stood
up
off
the
ground
like
great
fingers
and
returned
to
the
path
all
followed
without
comment
a
considerable
distance
was
covered
before
any
further
sign
of
the
presence
of
ambushed
death
was
shown
by
the
savages
then
it
came
with
tragic
suddenness
tucu
grunted
suddenly
and
in
one
instant
shifted
his
gait
from
the
easy
swing
of
the
march
to
the
prowl
of
a
hunting
animal
behind
him
the
line
grew
tense
the
click
of
rifle
hammers
and
of
safeties
being
thrown
off
breech
bolts
blended
with
the
faint
slither
of
arrows
being
swiftly
drawn
from
quivers
eyes
searched
the
bush
spying
no
enemy
two
more
steps
and
tucu
stopped
head
thrust
forward
eyes
boring
into
something
on
the
ground
the
rest
taking
care
not
to
touch
one
another
weapons
crowded
around
and
looked
down
at
the
huddled
form
of
a
man
a
matted
mass
of
black
hair
a
neck
burned
copper
brown
by
sun
tattered
cotton
shirt
and
trousers
big
bare
dirty
feet
a
rusty
repeating
rifle
of
heavy
caliber
these
were
what
they
saw
first
the
man
lay
straight
his
face
in
the
dirt
his
hands
a
little
ahead
as
if
he
had
been
crawling
forward
at
the
moment
of
death
tucu
turned
him
on
his
back
revealing
a
blanched
face
which
was
proof
positive
of
his
race
peruvian
said
pedro
what
got
him
demanded
knowlton
no
wound
on
him
lourenço
questioned
tucu
the
leader
who
evidently
knew
just
where
to
look
tore
open
the
thin
shirt
at
the
left
side
and
pointed
to
a
tiny
discoloration
surrounding
a
red
dot
under
the
ribs
he
muttered
a
few
laconic
words
a
blowgun
trap
lourenço
explained
the
gun
is
set
a
little
way
beyond
here
this
man
sneaking
along
the
path
broke
the
little
cord
which
shot
the
gun
the
poisoned
dart
struck
in
his
side
he
must
have
pulled
out
the
dart
but
he
could
not
go
far
before
his
legs
became
paralyzed
and
he
fell
then
still
trying
to
crawl
he
died
pedro
picked
up
the
dead
man
gun
and
worked
the
lever
the
weapon
was
fully
loaded
and
showed
no
sign
of
recent
firing
pedro
coolly
pumped
it
empty
gathered
up
the
blunt
cartridges
and
pocketed
them
for
his
own
use
tucu
watched
the
proceeding
in
satirical
approval
then
leaving
the
body
where
it
lay
he
went
stooping
along
the
path
ahead
his
keen
eyes
searching
the
undergrowth
in
a
few
minutes
he
returned
with
the
dart
which
as
lourenço
had
guessed
the
stricken
prowler
had
pulled
from
his
flesh
and
dropped
this
he
passed
to
a
blowgun
man
the
latter
carefully
opened
his
poison
pouch
redipped
the
point
of
the
dart
held
it
a
moment
to
dry
in
a
shaft
of
sunlight
and
slipped
it
into
his
dart
case
among
a
score
of
unused
missiles
no
waste
of
ammunition
here
was
mckay
dry
comment
what
happens
to
this
corpse
now
through
lourenço
mouth
tucu
answered
it
will
be
left
here
until
police
warriors
come
from
the
certain
men
travel
the
paths
daily
to
inspect
the
traps
when
they
find
this
man
they
will
cut
off
his
hands
and
feet
with
their
wooden
knives
and
throw
the
rest
aside
to
be
eaten
by
the
animals
he
has
not
been
dead
long
or
he
would
have
been
devoured
by
some
wild
thing
before
we
came
the
trail
travelers
will
set
the
trap
again
and
take
the
hands
and
feet
to
the
where
they
will
be
washed
cooked
and
eaten
the
faces
of
the
americans
contracted
slightly
a
simultaneous
thought
made
them
flash
startled
glances
at
each
other
tim
knowlton
said
and
paused
lourenço
smiled
no
senhor
tim
will
not
be
expected
to
eat
man
meat
he
assured
them
i
thought
of
that
before
we
left
one
never
knows
when
these
traps
will
yield
human
flesh
so
without
letting
monitaya
know
why
i
spoke
i
told
him
you
north
americans
believed
the
flesh
of
an
enemy
to
be
poisonous
and
that
you
would
not
eat
it
on
that
account
monitaya
will
remember
that
by
george
you
have
a
head
on
your
shoulders
old
scout
i
was
worried
for
a
minute
if
they
offered
tim
a
broiled
foot
or
a
stewed
hand
go
for
his
gun
briefly
tucu
spoke
the
mayorunas
separated
and
went
into
the
forest
seeking
any
sign
of
other
enemies
queer
that
this
chap
should
come
here
alone
if
he
was
alone
added
knowlton
suppose
he
the
fellow
that
been
swiping
stray
girls
or
a
spy
neither
i
think
senhor
the
girls
were
captured
by
more
than
one
man
and
i
doubt
if
this
one
had
been
here
before
probably
he
was
one
of
those
lone
prowlers
of
the
bush
whose
hand
is
against
every
man
he
is
a
as
you
see
and
came
perhaps
to
steal
a
girl
for
himself
the
jungle
is
well
rid
of
him
guess
you
right
say
i
like
to
see
how
that
blowgun
trap
operates
ca
understand
what
blows
the
dart
when
nobody
is
here
i
do
not
know
either
senhor
perhaps
tucu
will
show
us
the
savage
guide
after
a
moment
hesitation
pointed
along
the
trail
and
stalked
away
the
others
at
his
heels
at
a
spot
some
fifteen
yards
farther
on
he
turned
into
the
bush
at
the
right
walked
a
few
paces
away
from
the
path
turned
again
sharply
to
the
left
advanced
once
more
and
halted
before
them
not
easy
to
discern
in
the
masking
brush
even
though
they
were
looking
for
it
hung
the
long
barrel
of
the
blowgun
lashed
to
a
couple
of
small
trees
and
pointing
toward
the
path
tucu
stepped
to
the
mouthpiece
of
the
slender
tube
and
pointed
to
a
sapling
just
behind
and
in
line
with
it
which
had
been
cut
off
about
from
the
ground
from
the
tip
of
this
thin
trunk
dangled
a
wide
strip
of
bark
the
savage
having
indicated
this
stood
as
if
the
action
of
the
device
were
perfectly
clear
too
deep
for
me
admitted
mckay
after
a
puzzled
study
of
the
tube
and
the
trunk
the
others
nodded
agreement
lourenço
confessed
to
the
indian
the
blindness
of
all
thereupon
tucu
bent
the
sapling
far
over
and
released
it
as
it
sprang
erect
the
bark
strip
slapped
the
end
of
the
gun
also
the
watchers
saw
something
hitherto
unnoticed
a
thin
flexible
vine
attached
to
the
top
of
the
thin
stump
lourenço
face
showed
understanding
see
comrades
this
is
it
the
little
tree
is
bent
far
down
and
held
by
the
long
vine
the
vine
passes
around
a
low
branch
then
up
over
other
limbs
and
out
across
the
path
where
it
is
fastened
to
a
root
near
the
ground
a
man
following
the
path
breaks
the
vine
the
little
tree
then
flies
up
and
the
bark
sheet
strikes
the
wide
mouthpiece
of
the
gun
the
air
forced
into
that
mouthpiece
by
the
blow
of
the
bark
shoots
the
little
dart
the
dart
does
not
fly
as
hard
as
if
blown
by
a
man
but
it
goes
swiftly
enough
to
pierce
the
skin
of
anything
except
a
tapir
as
soon
as
the
poison
is
in
the
blood
the
work
is
done
it
sure
is
done
knowlton
echoed
thinking
of
the
short
distance
covered
by
the
dead
peruvian
after
passing
this
spot
mighty
ingenious
apparatus
these
people
are
no
fools
i
say
you
say
rightly
pedro
muttered
turning
they
went
out
to
the
path
looking
askance
at
the
thin
death
tube
as
they
passed
along
it
the
scouting
mayorunas
returned
having
found
nothing
tucu
resumed
his
place
at
the
head
of
the
line
without
a
backward
glance
at
the
body
sprawling
in
the
trail
at
the
rear
the
column
swung
into
its
usual
gait
the
americans
silent
before
were
silent
again
they
had
looked
for
the
first
time
on
the
work
of
the
mayoruna
traps
had
observed
the
way
in
which
the
indiana
handled
the
still
form
on
the
ground
had
visualized
the
forthcoming
mutilation
of
that
body
and
the
resultant
cannibal
rites
more
vividly
than
ever
before
they
realized
that
these
men
and
monitaya
himself
were
relentless
creatures
of
the
jungle
and
that
despite
the
present
existent
friendliness
there
yawned
between
them
and
their
barbarous
allies
an
impassable
gulf
for
the
moment
the
jungle
itself
seemed
a
poisonous
green
abyss
of
creeping
crawling
sneaking
death
and
though
they
had
faced
death
too
often
in
another
land
to
fear
it
in
any
form
though
they
marched
on
with
unwavering
step
their
eyes
were
somber
as
in
their
hearts
echoed
the
last
appeal
of
the
man
they
had
left
behind
them
ye
ai
goin
to
desert
a
comrade
amongst
a
lot
o
man
eaters
chapter
xix
the
red
bones
four
days
the
expedition
tramped
steadily
onward
through
the
rugged
labyrinthine
hills
four
nights
its
members
slept
in
utter
exhaustion
neither
by
day
nor
by
night
was
any
sign
of
the
raposa
seen
nor
of
any
other
human
being
so
tired
from
the
constant
struggle
did
the
americans
become
that
their
jaded
brains
began
to
picture
the
mysterious
wild
man
as
a
mere
legendary
creature
which
they
never
would
find
even
though
they
searched
the
inscrutable
forests
until
the
end
of
time
yet
when
on
the
fifth
day
tucu
informed
them
that
they
now
were
nearing
the
principal
settlement
of
the
red
bones
the
announcement
cheered
them
as
if
they
were
about
to
enter
a
civilized
city
and
there
meet
david
rand
safe
and
sane
not
that
any
chance
of
striking
his
trail
had
been
neglected
in
the
meantime
it
was
thoroughly
understood
that
if
he
were
met
anywhere
he
was
to
be
made
prisoner
and
that
thereafter
the
back
trail
should
be
taken
lourenço
had
impressed
on
tucu
the
fact
that
the
whole
journey
had
for
its
object
the
finding
of
the
wild
man
and
that
he
must
not
be
killed
if
found
since
the
indians
were
not
in
the
habit
of
hunting
so
assiduously
anyone
but
a
bitterly
hated
foe
it
is
quite
possible
that
they
misunderstood
the
spirit
of
the
quest
and
believed
the
prowler
would
if
captured
undergo
some
extremely
unpleasant
treatment
at
the
hands
of
the
white
men
but
so
long
as
it
was
made
clear
that
the
raposa
must
be
caught
alive
if
caught
at
all
lourenço
did
not
trouble
about
what
the
mayorunas
might
surmise
now
as
the
end
of
the
long
pathless
trail
approached
arose
a
question
of
which
mckay
had
previously
thought
but
had
not
spoken
how
he
was
to
converse
with
the
red
bone
chief
lourenço
asked
tucu
whether
the
red
bones
spoke
the
mayoruna
tongue
tucu
replied
that
they
did
not
he
added
however
that
the
languages
were
not
so
dissimilar
as
to
prevent
some
sort
of
understanding
being
reached
between
members
of
the
two
tribes
the
veteran
bushman
nodded
carelessly
when
the
tongue
fails
capitao
the
hands
still
can
talk
he
said
it
takes
more
time
and
work
that
is
all
ah
here
is
a
path
it
was
so
for
the
first
time
since
leaving
the
monitaya
region
a
path
lay
under
their
feet
and
for
the
first
time
tucu
and
his
fellow
mayorunas
glancing
along
that
faint
track
showed
hesitation
why
the
delay
snapped
mckay
they
suspect
traps
i
will
go
ahead
and
feel
out
the
way
i
have
done
it
before
on
other
paths
after
a
few
words
to
tucu
lourenço
cut
a
long
slim
pole
with
this
in
hand
he
preceded
the
column
walking
slowly
pausing
sometimes
continually
prodding
the
path
studying
it
with
unswerving
gaze
as
he
progressed
the
thin
but
rigid
feeler
strong
enough
to
tip
the
cover
of
any
pit
or
to
spring
any
concealed
bow
or
blowgun
was
at
least
ten
feet
long
and
between
the
scout
and
the
head
of
the
line
tucu
preserved
another
interval
progress
was
necessarily
slow
but
it
was
sure
in
this
fashion
they
advanced
perhaps
half
a
mile
not
once
did
they
have
to
leave
the
path
but
lourenço
caution
did
not
diminish
rather
it
increased
as
they
neared
the
red
bone
town
at
length
another
path
joined
the
one
on
which
they
were
traveling
here
lourenço
paused
for
minutes
inspecting
with
extreme
care
the
ground
and
the
bush
suddenly
he
cocked
his
head
as
if
listening
then
with
a
backward
motion
of
the
hand
to
enjoin
silence
he
faced
down
the
branch
path
and
stood
calmly
waiting
to
those
behind
came
a
light
rustle
of
leaves
and
a
scuffle
of
moving
feet
a
sudden
cessation
then
lourenço
voice
speaking
to
some
one
concealed
behind
the
intervening
undergrowth
his
tone
was
slow
quiet
easy
the
tone
which
even
if
the
words
were
not
understood
would
soothe
suspicious
and
abruptly
alarmed
minds
after
another
short
silence
he
resumed
talking
pointing
carelessly
to
the
place
behind
him
where
stood
the
silent
file
of
mayorunas
a
guttural
voice
replied
a
head
peered
cautiously
from
the
edge
of
the
bush
stared
fixedly
at
tucu
and
withdrew
the
voice
sounded
again
immediately
three
indians
stepped
into
view
poised
for
action
another
interval
of
staring
and
they
relaxed
come
forward
comrades
said
lourenço
they
came
halting
again
at
the
junction
of
the
trails
tucu
spoke
to
one
of
the
newcomers
who
scowled
as
if
only
partly
understanding
but
grunted
some
sort
of
answer
those
behind
the
mayoruna
leader
craned
their
necks
and
scanned
the
red
bone
men
who
continued
to
eye
with
evident
misgiving
the
cannibals
and
the
pair
of
whites
man
for
man
these
red
bones
were
in
every
way
inferior
to
the
emissaries
of
monitaya
their
bodies
were
more
gaunt
their
skins
more
coppery
their
foreheads
lower
and
their
expressions
much
less
intelligent
furthermore
they
wore
not
even
the
clouts
which
formed
the
sole
body
covering
of
the
mayorunas
they
were
totally
naked
the
one
point
of
similarity
between
the
two
tribes
was
that
the
faces
of
the
red
bone
men
were
streaked
with
red
dye
but
the
facial
design
was
much
different
two
short
transverse
stripes
on
the
forehead
and
three
lines
on
each
cheek
running
from
the
eyes
the
end
of
the
nose
and
the
corners
of
the
mouth
straight
back
to
the
ears
studying
those
visages
knowlton
and
mckay
recalled
schwandorf
statement
that
these
people
not
only
ate
human
flesh
but
tortured
prisoners
of
war
it
was
easy
to
believe
that
he
had
told
truth
mckay
standing
behind
pedro
shifted
his
position
a
bit
at
once
the
eyes
of
the
three
red
bones
widened
and
riveted
on
his
face
heretofore
they
had
seen
only
his
hat
and
eyes
the
rest
being
hidden
from
them
by
pedro
neck
and
an
intervening
palm
tip
now
that
they
saw
his
jaw
they
started
slightly
and
peered
intently
at
him
i
think
capitao
you
would
do
well
to
shave
pedro
suggested
with
a
smile
so
the
captain
granted
black
beards
evidently
are
in
the
jungle
social
set
at
present
but
then
one
of
the
red
bone
men
came
forward
still
squinting
narrowly
and
his
expression
was
not
hostile
in
fact
it
was
more
friendly
than
it
had
yet
been
after
a
closer
scrutiny
however
his
face
turned
blank
slowly
he
stepped
back
and
muttered
something
to
his
companions
at
this
pedro
eyes
narrowed
speculatively
but
his
expression
did
not
change
and
he
said
nothing
a
lengthy
conference
took
place
between
lourenço
and
tucu
on
the
one
hand
and
the
three
red
bone
tribesmen
on
the
other
a
difficult
talk
in
which
words
and
sign
language
both
were
used
and
frequently
repeated
eventually
an
understanding
was
reached
the
three
stepped
back
picked
up
some
small
game
which
they
had
dropped
on
beholding
lourenço
returned
and
led
the
way
along
the
path
lourenço
cast
aside
his
poke
stick
and
resumed
his
usual
place
in
the
column
the
whole
line
moved
ahead
at
a
much
smarter
gait
than
before
note
this
path
is
not
mined
thought
knowlton
this
proved
true
moreover
the
way
now
was
more
broad
and
firm
so
that
travel
on
it
was
much
easier
after
twenty
minutes
of
rapid
tramping
it
debouched
abruptly
into
a
cleared
space
here
all
halted
before
them
lay
a
town
of
small
low
huts
crowded
closely
together
in
two
parallel
rows
which
curved
together
at
one
end
the
other
end
lay
open
giving
access
to
a
sizable
creek
whereon
floated
canoes
at
the
water
edge
along
the
crude
street
studded
with
charred
stumps
and
among
the
huts
moved
naked
figures
of
men
and
women
occupied
with
various
sluggish
activities
some
of
the
men
already
had
spied
the
invading
party
and
were
standing
at
gaze
comrades
we
have
reached
the
end
of
our
trail
said
lourenço
running
a
cool
eye
over
the
place
now
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
find
your
raposa
and
get
him
and
ourselves
away
alive
that
all
knowlton
echoed
unsmiling
the
reception
committee
is
forming
now
and
with
the
words
he
unbuttoned
his
holster
a
shrill
yell
had
run
along
the
double
line
of
houses
and
out
into
the
stumpy
street
now
swarmed
men
armed
with
hastily
seized
weapons
hands
pointed
confused
exclamations
sounded
and
a
compact
detachment
of
warriors
came
jogging
toward
the
newcomers
the
three
guides
drew
away
from
the
mayorunas
the
latter
promptly
fitted
arrows
to
their
bows
inserted
darts
in
their
blowguns
lifted
spears
or
clubs
and
with
eyes
glittering
awaited
whatever
might
befall
a
couple
of
rods
away
the
red
bones
halted
bows
ready
a
savage
who
seemed
to
be
in
command
rasped
something
at
the
three
hunters
who
quickened
their
pace
toward
him
tucu
strode
out
four
paces
beyond
his
own
men
and
stopped
then
both
parties
waited
while
the
hunters
reported
what
they
knew
to
the
what
did
you
tell
them
lourenço
asked
mckay
that
we
came
on
a
friendly
visit
to
the
chief
for
whom
we
had
important
words
nothing
of
the
raposa
no
they
wasted
much
time
arguing
that
we
must
tell
them
all
our
business
and
let
them
inform
the
chief
while
we
were
to
stay
back
on
the
path
until
permitted
to
enter
the
town
we
told
them
our
talk
was
for
the
chief
alone
and
that
we
should
come
here
whether
they
liked
it
or
not
so
having
no
choice
they
led
us
in
mckay
made
no
comment
none
was
necessary
furthermore
his
steady
eyes
had
caught
a
simultaneous
head
movement
of
the
red
bones
a
peering
movement
as
if
all
were
seeking
some
one
man
among
the
new
arrivals
pedro
observed
this
he
spoke
softly
to
lourenço
lourenço
tell
tucu
to
say
to
the
red
bones
that
we
come
led
by
a
white
man
that
this
blackboard
comes
from
the
country
where
all
men
wear
black
beards
that
the
blackbeard
will
speak
with
the
chief
only
the
americans
looked
queerly
at
the
young
brazilian
as
did
lourenço
himself
but
without
question
lourenço
obeyed
calling
to
tucu
he
gave
the
message
tucu
moved
his
head
slightly
but
gave
no
other
sign
of
having
heard
now
capitao
step
forward
a
little
and
show
yourself
more
clearly
prompted
pedro
with
another
puzzled
glance
mckay
did
so
he
saw
that
the
brown
eyes
of
the
younger
man
held
a
dancing
gleam
but
he
could
not
read
the
thought
behind
those
eyes
yet
he
noticed
that
as
soon
as
he
stepped
out
the
red
bones
all
focused
their
gaze
on
him
more
than
that
the
spokesman
of
the
three
hunters
pointed
at
him
and
said
something
to
the
leader
now
that
leader
came
forward
alone
six
feet
from
tucu
he
halted
again
and
talked
in
a
growling
tone
the
mayoruna
leader
cool
and
dignified
made
answer
after
a
somewhat
protracted
exchange
tucu
turned
his
head
and
motioned
to
lourenço
who
went
forward
listened
replied
shortly
and
came
back
meanwhile
the
first
detachment
of
red
bones
had
been
strongly
reinforced
by
others
who
had
come
up
singly
or
in
small
parties
now
the
expedition
was
outnumbered
at
least
four
to
one
by
naked
men
ready
if
not
eager
for
trouble
the
red
bone
says
we
shall
see
the
chief
lourenço
stated
at
first
he
said
only
you
capitao
should
go
to
him
then
he
insisted
that
we
all
lay
down
our
arms
tucu
has
told
him
we
lay
down
our
arms
for
no
man
or
men
that
we
come
in
peace
otherwise
there
would
be
many
more
of
us
that
we
leave
in
peace
unless
the
red
bones
themselves
bring
on
a
fight
in
that
case
though
we
are
few
there
lies
behind
us
the
power
of
monitaya
and
behind
monitaya
the
power
of
the
mayoruna
chiefs
all
strong
enough
to
wipe
the
red
bone
nation
off
the
face
of
the
ground
strong
stuff
that
said
knowlton
strong
yes
but
no
stronger
than
is
needed
to
impress
these
people
tucu
intends
to
prevent
trouble
if
he
can
and
often
the
best
way
to
prevent
trouble
is
to
make
the
other
man
realize
what
may
happen
to
him
if
he
starts
it
also
he
has
his
orders
from
monitaya
to
stay
with
us
at
all
times
and
he
will
follow
that
order
even
if
you
capitao
try
to
change
it
now
we
go
together
to
the
chief
he
nodded
to
tucu
who
grunted
to
the
red
bone
leader
the
in
turn
shouted
something
to
the
men
behind
slowly
they
drew
apart
into
two
groups
you
are
the
leader
capitao
suggested
lourenço
promptly
mckay
marched
forward
head
up
eyes
front
face
bleak
the
rest
followed
tucu
falling
in
behind
mckay
when
the
captain
passed
him
preceded
by
the
red
bone
spokesman
the
line
advanced
between
the
two
bodies
of
and
swung
along
the
avenue
to
its
upper
end
there
in
the
very
center
of
the
loop
joining
the
two
rows
of
huts
was
a
house
twice
as
big
as
any
other
from
its
doorway
the
inhabitant
of
that
house
could
watch
the
whole
life
of
the
red
bone
town
obviously
it
was
the
home
of
the
chief
at
its
door
a
pair
of
warriors
stood
guard
but
of
the
ruler
himself
there
was
no
sign
ten
paces
from
it
the
leader
stopped
and
motioned
to
mckay
to
halt
as
the
captain
and
the
line
behind
him
did
so
he
stalked
onward
passed
through
the
doorway
and
faded
from
sight
in
the
dimness
beyond
with
one
accord
the
members
of
the
visiting
party
looked
around
them
the
street
behind
now
was
filled
with
the
mass
of
red
bone
warriors
who
had
trooped
after
the
column
all
exit
in
that
direction
was
blockaded
but
the
noted
that
between
the
houses
were
spaces
each
wide
enough
to
hold
a
couple
of
men
and
in
an
undertone
mckay
gave
defensive
instructions
to
lourenço
if
fighting
starts
have
the
mayorunas
take
cover
along
these
houses
on
each
side
we
who
have
guns
will
use
the
chief
house
we
can
sweep
the
whole
street
from
there
you
two
fellows
capture
the
chief
alive
if
possible
he
be
more
useful
as
a
hostage
than
as
a
corpse
pedro
beamed
approval
of
this
swiftly
formed
plan
lourenço
muttered
to
tucu
who
in
turn
passed
the
word
down
the
line
then
all
stood
waiting
presently
the
red
bone
man
came
out
he
shouted
a
name
from
the
doorway
near
at
hand
where
he
had
been
standing
and
peering
at
the
small
but
formidable
body
of
newcomers
an
old
man
now
stepped
forth
and
advanced
limping
a
little
to
the
the
latter
talked
briefly
to
him
then
to
tucu
the
mayoruna
leader
pointed
to
lourenço
the
old
man
spoke
to
the
brazilian
who
answered
at
once
thereupon
the
wizened
old
fellow
entered
the
chief
house
that
old
man
speaks
the
mayoruna
tongue
quite
well
capitao
said
lourenço
he
says
you
and
i
shall
enter
and
talk
through
his
mouth
with
the
chief
all
others
remain
outside
and
we
must
leave
our
rifles
here
all
right
glad
we
can
leave
tucu
out
here
to
control
these
fellows
here
merry
he
passed
his
rifle
to
knowlton
pedro
took
gun
with
packs
still
on
their
backs
the
chosen
men
proceeded
to
the
doorway
and
entered
the
house
where
waited
the
ruler
of
the
red
bone
tribe
behind
them
the
line
settled
into
easier
postures
of
waiting
the
red
bones
though
so
compactly
ranged
as
to
cut
off
any
chance
of
escape
held
their
distance
obviously
neither
inclined
to
fraternize
nor
ready
to
precipitate
conflict
by
crowding
thus
while
keeping
their
ears
open
for
any
sound
of
a
concerted
movement
from
behind
the
visitors
could
use
their
eyes
to
inspect
the
huts
nearest
them
in
some
of
these
women
stood
near
the
doorways
staring
with
unwinking
absorption
at
the
athletic
men
outside
who
were
so
much
better
to
look
upon
than
their
own
mates
the
mayorunas
returned
the
stares
with
the
brief
glances
of
men
accustomed
to
noticing
everything
but
totally
uninterested
as
well
they
might
be
for
these
poorly
shaped
females
were
not
to
be
compared
with
their
own
women
knowlton
and
pedro
too
looked
them
over
but
with
the
same
expression
as
if
inspecting
a
family
of
lizards
then
they
glanced
into
other
huts
now
empty
of
life
and
in
a
couple
of
these
they
saw
rigid
objects
hanging
from
the
roofs
the
red
bones
of
the
dead
senhor
pedro
muttered
and
his
blond
companion
peering
again
at
the
sinister
decorations
nodded
without
reply
voices
came
to
them
from
the
chief
house
talking
with
droning
deliberation
evidently
no
cause
for
friction
had
yet
arisen
they
let
their
eyes
rove
on
beyond
the
guarded
doorway
to
pause
at
a
house
a
short
distance
away
at
the
right
there
stood
a
clubman
who
leaned
idly
on
his
weapon
but
showed
no
intention
of
moving
from
his
place
the
door
of
that
house
was
closed
not
only
closed
but
barred
on
the
outside
hm
looks
like
a
jail
said
knowlton
pedro
smiled
but
an
intent
look
came
into
his
face
and
he
studied
the
closed
house
suddenly
both
started
at
one
corner
of
the
house
unseen
by
the
clubman
a
head
had
cautiously
slipped
forth
for
only
an
instant
it
hung
there
before
dodging
back
out
of
sight
but
both
the
watching
men
had
seen
that
the
face
though
half
masked
by
long
dark
hair
and
a
thick
beard
was
much
lighter
than
that
of
any
red
bone
savage
and
in
the
hair
above
one
ear
was
a
white
streak

the
raposa
mckay
and
lourenço
in
a
broad
low
room
faced
a
man
who
stood
and
a
man
who
sat
the
man
who
stood
was
the
old
savage
who
could
talk
in
the
mayoruna
language
the
man
who
sat
was
the
chief
of
the
red
bones
in
his
first
words
to
the
visitors
the
old
interpreter
revealed
that
the
name
of
the
red
bone
ruler
was
umanuh
later
on
lourenço
informed
mckay
that
in
the
tupi
of
the
amazonian
indians
which
however
was
not
spoken
by
this
tribe
the
word
umanuh
meant
corpse
and
whatever
the
name
may
have
signified
in
the
language
of
the
red
bones
its
tupi
definition
fitted
with
disagreeable
precision
for
umanuh
was
a
living
cadaver
gaunt
gray
skinned
lank
haired
hollow
of
cheek
and
eye
with
thin
cruel
lips
so
tight
drawn
that
the
teeth
behind
seemed
to
show
through
ribs
projecting
clawlike
hands
resting
on
bony
knees
his
whole
frame
motionless
as
that
of
a
man
long
dead
the
head
man
of
the
tribe
was
the
antithesis
of
both
the
piggish
suba
and
the
herculean
monitaya
only
his
eyes
lived
and
those
eyes
were
cold
and
merciless
as
those
of
a
snake
or
a
vulture
a
man
who
ruled
by
ruthless
cunning
who
would
gaze
unmoved
on
the
most
ghastly
tortures
who
would
devour
human
flesh
with
ghoulish
relish
such
was
the
creature
who
sat
in
a
hammock
and
contemplated
the
impassive
face
of
mckay
umanuh
great
chief
eater
of
his
enemies
with
fangs
of
the
jaguar
and
wisdom
of
the
great
snake
awaits
the
greeting
of
the
droned
the
old
mouthpiece
of
the
chief
makkay
leader
of
the
fighting
men
of
the
blackbeards
whose
voice
is
the
thunder
and
whose
hand
spits
lightning
and
death
gives
greeting
to
umanuh
responded
lourenço
in
a
like
droning
tone
a
pause
umanuh
gave
no
sign
of
life
mckay
straight
and
cold
met
the
unwinking
stare
of
the
chief
with
his
own
chill
gray
gaze
between
the
two
who
spoke
not
was
a
testing
of
wills
makkay
brings
with
him
none
of
the
blackbeard
warriors
pointed
out
the
interpreter
who
seemed
to
know
his
master
thought
he
comes
with
only
the
jungle
men
of
light
skins
makkay
needs
none
of
his
own
warriors
when
he
comes
in
peace
if
he
came
in
war
the
terrible
blackbeards
with
him
would
cause
the
whole
forest
to
fly
apart
in
smoke
and
flame
since
he
walks
in
peace
to
visit
his
friend
umanuh
of
whose
wisdom
he
has
heard
he
brings
only
his
friends
the
mayorunas
who
are
friends
also
to
the
men
of
the
red
bones
another
pause
the
old
man
now
seemed
somewhat
uncertain
of
himself
the
silent
duel
between
mckay
and
umanuh
went
on
at
length
the
chief
eyes
flickered
a
trifle
in
a
hissing
whisper
he
said
something
the
men
of
the
mayorunas
never
come
to
this
country
unless
seeking
something
the
interpreter
promptly
spoke
up
what
do
they
seek
only
that
which
makkay
seeks
then
turning
to
the
captain
the
brazilian
added
capitao
we
now
have
reached
the
point
to
talk
business
have
you
any
presents
and
is
it
your
wish
to
give
them
now
or
later
i
have
a
few
things
but
i
give
them
later
if
at
all
this
chief
is
hostile
tell
him
what
we
here
for
and
see
how
he
acts
it
has
come
to
the
ears
of
makkay
lourenço
informed
the
man
of
umanuh
that
a
man
of
the
blackbeards
lives
among
the
men
of
the
red
bones
makkay
would
see
that
man
again
the
interpreter
awaited
his
master
voice
before
answering
no
man
of
the
blackbeards
is
among
the
men
of
umanuh
he
then
denied
if
he
is
not
among
them
he
is
near
them
was
lourenço
certain
reply
he
has
been
seen
both
by
other
blackbeards
and
by
the
mayorunas
i
too
have
seen
him
he
bears
on
his
bones
the
sign
that
his
mind
is
out
of
his
skull
his
eyes
are
green
and
his
hair
touched
with
white
umanuh
and
his
men
know
well
that
i
speak
true
the
pause
this
time
was
longer
than
before
there
was
such
a
man
but
he
is
gone
then
makkay
asks
his
friend
umanuh
to
find
that
one
a
chief
so
wise
can
easily
find
him
where
others
would
see
only
water
and
mud
if
he
could
be
found
what
would
the
great
blackbeard
leader
do
with
him
lourenço
thought
swiftly
to
say
the
raposa
was
mckay
friend
would
do
little
good
friendship
meant
nothing
to
this
unfeeling
brute
therefore
the
bushman
insinuated
something
which
his
cruel
mind
could
comprehend
if
a
red
bone
man
abandoned
his
people
and
went
to
another
tribe
what
would
umanuh
do
to
him
when
he
was
found
a
cold
glimmer
in
the
chief
eyes
showed
that
he
thought
he
understood
moreover
he
would
much
like
to
see
what
sort
of
torture
this
blackbeard
would
use
on
a
fugitive
it
might
be
something
even
more
fiendish
than
his
own
pastimes
so
the
next
reply
came
promptly
if
that
man
is
found
the
blackbeard
will
pay
for
him
there
are
gifts
of
friendship
for
umanuh
lourenço
nodded
the
blackbeard
leader
will
pay
more
than
the
other
blackbeard
lourenço
almost
blinked
what
other
blackbeard
the
raposa
himself
but
the
brazilian
repressed
his
bewilderment
makkay
will
first
see
the
man
to
make
sure
he
is
the
blackbeard
whom
makkay
wants
he
dodged
then
he
will
pay
well
umanuh
will
see
the
gifts
now
the
gifts
can
not
be
shown
now
they
are
packed
away
when
makkay
has
looked
on
the
man
umanuh
shall
look
on
the
gifts
another
eye
duel
between
the
chief
and
mckay
as
before
the
eye
proved
the
harder
umanuh
will
think
of
the
matter
night
comes
the
man
hunted
by
the
blackbeard
is
not
here
the
blackbeard
and
his
men
may
stay
across
the
water
when
the
sun
rises
again
umanuh
will
talk
further
it
is
well
let
umanuh
tell
his
men
to
stay
on
this
side
of
the
water
that
we
may
not
mistake
them
in
the
night
for
enemies
when
umanuh
had
hissed
assent
the
old
man
stepped
to
the
doorway
and
summoned
the
warrior
to
him
instructions
were
given
he
turned
and
carried
the
commands
to
the
tribesmen
makkay
wishes
umanuh
peaceful
rest
said
lourenço
with
which
he
flicked
his
eyes
toward
the
door
mckay
with
stiff
stride
stalked
out
lourenço
followed
both
felt
the
snake
eyes
of
the
cadaverous
chief
dwelling
on
their
backs
to
the
waiting
knowlton
pedro
and
tucu
it
was
briefly
explained
that
preliminary
negotiations
had
been
concluded
and
that
camp
now
would
be
made
on
the
farther
side
of
the
creek
tucu
observing
that
the
red
bone
mass
behind
was
dividing
again
to
let
the
visitors
pass
through
gave
the
word
to
his
men
the
column
began
to
move
out
marching
in
reverse
order
pedro
muttered
swiftly
to
his
partner
lourenço
see
that
house
with
the
barred
door
where
the
clubman
stands
guard
remember
where
it
is
the
other
swept
the
loop
in
one
quick
glance
located
the
house
and
fell
into
step
without
a
word
the
guarded
structure
fixed
on
his
brain
as
clearly
as
if
he
had
studied
it
for
an
hour
walking
down
the
malodorous
street
he
said
quietly
there
will
be
a
small
moon
you
are
becoming
a
reader
of
the

comrade
pedro
grinned
no
more
was
said
down
to
the
shore
of
the
creek
trooped
the
party
followed
closely
by
the
and
a
score
of
tribesmen
the
whites
and
the
mayorunas
got
into
half
a
dozen
of
the
waiting
canoes
and
paddled
across
in
other
dugouts
the
red
bone
men
also
crossed
but
they
did
not
land
as
soon
as
the
borrowed
boats
were
empty
the
tribesmen
took
them
in
tow
and
returned
to
their
own
bank
the
visitors
were
left
on
a
partly
cleared
shore
separated
from
their
uncordial
hosts
by
some
twenty
yards
of
deep
water
not
one
canoe
was
left
them
furthermore
the
red
bones
now
began
activities
indicating
an
intention
to
establish
a
on
the
irside
of
the
stream
taking
no
chances
of
our
raiding
them
or
even
snooping
around
town
said
knowlton
keeping
everything
in
their
own
hands
reckon
we
better
post
sentries
rod
just
to
keep
an
eye
on
that
outpost
of
theirs
mckay
nodded
we
four
will
take
it
in
turn
he
agreed
lourenço
pedro
you
i
tours
pardon
capitao
interposed
pedro
it
would
be
well
to
change
that
you
two
senhores
take
the
first
two
watches
why
frowned
mckay
because
lourenço
and
i
wish
to
go
visiting
we
are
much
smitten
with
the
charms
of
the
ladies
here
the
captain
frown
deepened
but
he
studied
pedro
face
keenly
before
answering
humph
what
up
your
sleeve
out
with
it
pedro
glanced
around
him
and
across
the
water
the
tribesmen
both
of
the
mayoruna
force
and
of
the
red
bones
were
watching
the
colloquy
we
are
watched
capitao
let
us
make
camp
now
and
talk
later
these
men
do
not
understand
our
words
but
we
can
not
tell
what
they
may
see
in
our
faces
now
speak
harshly
as
if
i
had
been
insolent
mckay
did
he
thundered
at
the
young
bushman
as
if
about
to
do
him
bodily
injury
pedro
retreated
a
step
as
if
taken
aback
by
the
storm
he
had
unleashed
when
mckay
stopped
he
replied
excellent
capitao
now
i
go
to
start
work
on
the
he
trudged
away
with
a
sullen
gait
on
both
sides
of
the
stream
the
indians
muttered
and
looked
at
the
tall
commander
with
increased
respect
truly
the
blackbeard
was
a
fierce
ruler
and
one
who
must
not
be
angered
he
had
the
voice
of
a
great
gun
and
the
temper
of
a
jaguar
that
other
man
was
lucky
to
have
his
head
still
on
his
shoulders
when
the
camp
was
made
at
the
edge
of
the
bush
and
the
four
comrades
were
grouped
in
their
hammocks
lourenço
narrated
in
detail
the
conversation
with
umanuh
knowlton
reciprocated
with
news
of
what
he
and
pedro
had
seen
at
the
corner
of
the
barred
house
i
almost
jumped
after
him
rod
he
admitted
had
all
i
could
do
to
hold
myself
but
i
knew
anything
sudden
like
that
might
start
war
right
there
and
we
would
have
a
chinaman
chance
of
getting
away
with
him
so
i
stood
fast
but
he
here
and
old
umanuh
a
liar
by
the
clock
if
he
says
otherwise
he
is
the
same
man
we
saw
in
the
forest
lourenço
or
my
eyes
are
twisted
added
pedro
hm
something
very
fishy
here
commented
mckay
very
fishy
indeed
capitao
lourenço
echoed
the
man
is
within
call
yet
umanuh
says
he
is
not
here
and
umanuh
wants
us
to
buy
the
man
what
is
more
he
asks
if
we
will
pay
more
than
the
other
blackbeard
what
other
blackbeard
the
man
himself
has
a
dark
beard
and
since
we
left
headquarters
pedro
and
i
have
grown
black
whiskers
too
yet
umanuh
can
not
mean
the
crazy
man
would
pay
him
to
stay
here
or
that
either
of
us
brazilians
would
try
to
buy
him
there
are
no
other
men
with
black
beards
except
the
german
and
of
course
he
can
not
be
the
one
no
pedro
asked
softly
no
certainly
why
of
what
were
you
thinking
pedro
brown
eyes
twinkled
but
he
made
no
answer
he
only
inhaled
a
long
puff
from
his
cigarette
and
looked
across
the
water
at
the
town
what
about
that
visiting
trip
of
yours
mckay
asked
i
wish
to
see
what
is
in
that
house
with
the
barred
door
capitao
when
i
am
curious
about
such
a
matter
lourenço
always
becomes
curious
too
so
i
shall
have
to
take
him
with
me
if
i
did
not
he
would
say
i
was
making
love
to
the
chief
wives
deus
that
may
be
all
the
barred
house
holds
the
wives
of
the
chief
guessed
lourenço
why
waste
time
and
risk
death
to
look
into
that
place
nao
arrisca
nao
as
the
coronel
would
say
he
who
risks
nothing
gains
nothing
i
feel
that
we
should
visit
that
house
something
calls
me
back
to
it
lourenço
studied
his
partner
a
moment
then
nodded
slowly
but
mckay
interposed
decided
objection
too
dangerous
also
unnecessary
we
get
rand
if
the
man
is
rand
through
the
chief
your
night
spying
might
ruin
everything
and
get
you
killed
into
the
bargain
nothing
to
gain
and
all
to
lose
stay
here
pedro
eyes
hardened
but
it
was
lourenço
who
answered
capitao
i
think
we
had
best
do
as
pedro
says
it
is
a
queer
thing
and
i
can
not
explain
it
but
i
have
known
him
to
have
such
ideas
in
the
past
and
they
have
always
worked
out
for
the
best
he
himself
does
not
know
why
he
does
some
things
things
which
look
totally
foolish
and
which
often
are
very
dangerous
except
that
he
feels
like
doing
them
yet
i
have
never
known
this
foolishness
to
fail
to
turn
out
well
he
and
i
will
go
over
and
see
what
we
may
see
the
captain
brows
drew
together
flat
insubordination
then
he
remembered
that
these
men
were
not
subordinates
at
all
remembered
also
what
coronel
nunes
said
concerning
their
ability
to
get
into
and
out
of
dangerous
situations
when
knowlton
sided
with
them
he
capitulated
up
in
the
states
we
say
pedro
was
his
hunch
was
the
lieutenant
remark
and
i
known
a
hunch
to
bring
all
kinds
of
good
luck
gee
i
like
to
go
across
with
you
lads
myself
but
i
no
jungle
expert
especially
after
dark
and
i
only
be
in
the
way
besides
we
sure
have
to
stick
here
and
keep
up
appearances
while
you
gone
how
will
you
get
over
there
no
way
but
swimming
and
this
probably
inhabited
by
the
usual
and
snakes
and
things
when
one
can
travel
only
by
swimming
one
swims
pedro
smiled
leave
that
to
us
senhores
now
the
sun
sinks
fast
and
i
have
hunger
let
us
eat
night
was
at
hand
while
the
whites
talked
some
of
the
mayorunas
had
quietly
slipped
away
into
the
bush
seeking
whatever
fresh
meat
might
be
obtainable
without
straying
too
far
from
camp
naturally
the
hunting
was
poor
so
near
an
inhabited
place
but
now
the
absent
men
came
stealing
back
with
a
few
small
birds
and
one
monkey
though
the
savages
asked
nothing
and
evidently
expected
nothing
from
the
whites
to
eke
out
this
scant
provision
the
latter
opened
their
meager
larders
to
tucu
ordering
him
to
see
that
every
man
had
at
least
a
few
mouthfuls
to
eat
tucu
like
a
good
commander
made
no
bones
of
accepting
the
invitation
for
the
good
of
his
men
when
all
hands
had
stowed
away
the
last
meal
of
the
day
the
rations
were
reduced
almost
to
the
vanishing
point
those
miserable
whelps
over
there
might
have
had
the
decency
to
give
us
a
few
bites
knowlton
growled
looking
at
the
red
bone
men
on
the
other
bank
who
were
gorging
themselves
on
meat
brought
by
their
women
it
is
quite
possible
that
they
intend
to
give
us
several
bites
later
on
pedro
suggested
with
a
mirthless
smile
should
wonder
but
it
also
possible
that
they
have
to
assimilate
a
few
lead
pills
before
chewing
us
up
rod
we
have
our
work
cut
out
standing
guard
i
would
put
it
past
that
lying
old
umanuh
to
try
rubbing
us
out
before
morning
nor
i
concurred
mckay
only
question
is
whether
he
dares
take
a
chance
against
our
guns
and
against
the
likelihood
that
monitaya
will
send
other
men
to
investigate
our
disappearance
better
keep
well
out
of
sight
as
he
spoke
the
last
light
of
day
vanished
stars
and
a
quarter
moon
leaped
out
in
the
swiftly
darkening
sky
the
small
fire
of
the
expedition
threw
dim
shadows
against
the
poles
of
the
night
shelters
lights
glimmered
in
the
red
bone
huts
and
other
lights
began
to
streak
across
the
gloom
the
bright
little
lanterns
of
fireflies
coasting
along
the
stream
but
at
the
point
where
the
red
bone
night
guard
lurked
no
light
shone
they
had
built
no
fire
and
now
they
were
almost
invisible
in
the
faint
moonshine
sinister
shadows
which
even
now
might
be
meditating
murder
or
worse
lourenço
lounged
over
to
tucu
who
was
watching
those
shadows
with
a
fixed
cat
stare
and
informed
him
that
until
morning
a
man
with
a
gun
would
be
always
on
guard
while
the
rest
slept
the
indian
grunted
approval
by
way
of
precaution
against
being
killed
by
his
own
men
the
brazilian
added
the
information
that
later
on
he
and
his
comrade
would
leave
the
camp
and
go
upstream
for
a
time
at
this
tucu
eyes
dwelt
on
his
veered
to
the
lights
of
the
town
and
returned
in
them
was
a
plain
though
unspoken
question
the
bushman
ignored
it
and
strolled
back
to
his
the
moon
sailed
higher
the
animal
uproar
of
early
night
began
to
diminish
the
fire
almost
buried
under
wood
whose
acrid
smoke
alleviated
the
insect
pests
smoldered
dull
red
mckay
and
knowlton
drew
lots
for
the
first
sleep
the
captain
winning
and
promptly
getting
under
his
net
in
the
mayoruna
shelter
all
was
dark
and
silent
each
man
sleeping
lightly
with
one
hand
on
a
weapon
the
two
brazilians
also
were
out
of
sight
in
their
hut
up
and
down
a
barely
distinguishable
figure
knowlton
passed
slowly
with
holster
unbuttoned
and
rifle
cocked
eyes
turning
periodically
to
the
red
bone
outpost
and
ears
intent
to
pick
any
unusual
sound
out
of
the
night
noise
gradually
the
small
lights
of
the
town
faded
out
to
all
appearance
sleep
had
whelmed
it
for
the
night
the
watchers
on
the
farther
shore
stirred
a
little
at
times
but
the
blot
they
made
in
the
moonshine
remained
fixed
in
the
same
spot
the
only
moving
things
were
the
sentinel
and
the
blazing
fireflies
another
hour
rolled
slowly
by
the
sentinel
stopped
and
stood
at
a
corner
of
the
now
was
as
good
a
time
as
any
for
the
brazilians
to
start
their
perilous
reconnaissance
perhaps
they
had
gone
to
sleep
he
squinted
at
their
hammocks
yes
they
were
occupied
stepping
softly
to
the
hammock
of
pedro
he
lifted
the
net
to
whisper
to
the
occupant
then
he
stared
dropped
the
net
and
lifted
lourenço
curtain
a
soft
chuckle
sounded
in
his
throat
as
he
stole
out
again
the
hammocks
were
occupied
yes
but
only
by
packs
and
rifles
armed
only
with
machetes
the
two
bushmen
now
were
where
he
did
not
even
know
when
or
which
way
they
had
gone
fine
sentinel
was
he
to
let
two
men
sneak
away
right
under
his
nose
and
if
they
could
get
out
so
slick
why
could
somebody
else
a
murderous
red
bone
for
instance
get
in
with
equal
facility
wherefore
he
became
all
the
more
alert
instead
of
resuming
his
slow
pace
he
stood
quiet
at
a
corner
scrutinizing
everything
within
his
range
of
vision
listening
more
intently
than
ever
two
or
three
times
he
leaned
forward
and
lifted
his
piece
as
some
splashing
noise
in
the
creek
came
to
him
but
each
time
the
cannibal
guards
on
the
other
bank
also
sprang
to
see
what
caused
the
sound
then
grunted
to
one
another
and
relaxed
so
he
knew
it
was
made
by
piscatory
or
reptilian
life
near
him
nothing
moved
and
the
moon
sailed
on
westward
smoothly
steadily
measuring
off
the
silent
hours
of
the
night
watch
then
all
at
once
every
nerve
in
him
strained
toward
the
back
of
the
something
was
there
he
had
not
heard
it
seen
it
smelled
it
but
he
felt
it
a
nameless
thing
that
did
not
belong
there
with
smooth
speed
he
pivoted
looked
listened
nothing
there
motionless
feeling
slightly
creepy
concealed
under
the
roof
corner
he
waited
a
sound
came
a
stealthy
sound
something
was
creeping
in
lourenço
and
pedro
perhaps
stooping
low
he
peered
along
the
ground
under
the
hammocks
a
man
was
coming
coming
on
like
an
animal
he
was
too
stealthy
to
be
either
of
the
brazilians
knowlton
glimpsed
him
only
dimly
but
he
was
sure
this
was
no
man
who
belonged
here
and
now
as
on
a
previous
occasion
almost
identical
in
its
circumstances
the
watchman
acted
in
accordance
with
tim
ryan
general
order
number
thirteen
in
three
jumps
he
was
upon
the
invader
his
gun
butt
crashed
down
on
the
rising
head
the
other
collapsed
on
the
ground
swiftly
knowlton
snapped
a
match
with
his
the
sudden
flare
half
blinded
him
but
what
he
saw
made
him
suck
in
his
breath
when
the
match
went
out
he
turned
the
senseless
body
over
drew
his
pocket
flashlight
stabbed
its
white
ray
downward
then
he
committed
the
unpardonable
sin
of
the
army
he
dropped
his
rifle
dark
haired
dark
bearded
streaked
with
red
dye
and
bleeding
slightly
at
the
nose
at
his
feet
lay
the
man
for
whom
the
indomitable
trio
had
traveled
thousands
of
miles
and
dared
all
the
deaths
of
the
jungle
the
raposa
chapter
xxi
shadows
of
the
night
rod
wake
up
the
tense
whisper
aroused
mckay
instantly
with
one
sweep
of
the
arm
his
net
was
torn
aside
and
he
leaped
out
with
pistol
drawn
right
merry
what
is
it
we
got
him
look
the
electric
ray
again
streaked
the
gloom
the
astounded
captain
did
not
drop
his
gun
but
he
came
near
it
for
a
long
minute
he
stood
as
in
a
trance
when
he
attempted
to
holster
his
weapon
he
fumbled
three
times
for
the
sheath
before
he
found
it
whew
he
breathed
have
you
killed
him
nope
do
think
so
lord
i
hope
not
now
that
i
think
of
it
i
did
give
him
a
mighty
solid
smash
used
the
butt
he
was
crawling
in
here
and
naturally
i
did
stop
to
ask
for
his
card
feel
his
head
mckay
complied
his
exploring
fingers
found
only
a
huge
bump
under
the
thick
hair
no
his
skull
whole
did
even
split
the
scalp
you
crowned
him
hard
but
unless
he
got
concussion
he
still
useful
his
nosebleed
comes
from
hitting
the
ground
i
think
turn
off
the
light
are
you
still
on
guard
yes
the
brazilians
are
out
take
a
turn
and
see
that
all
clear
ca
tell
what
might
break
any
minute
now
leave
your
flash
here
passing
the
flat
nickel
to
the
captain
knowlton
retrieved
his
gun
from
the
ground
and
resumed
his
patrol
slight
as
the
disturbance
had
been
uneasiness
was
in
the
air
the
savages
on
the
far
shore
were
up
peering
at
the
and
muttering
to
one
another
measuring
the
distance
the
lieutenant
saw
that
though
they
had
undoubtedly
seen
the
flashlight
switched
on
and
off
and
made
out
the
movements
of
men
they
could
not
have
discerned
what
lay
on
the
ground
beyond
the
hammocks
nearer
at
hand
tucu
and
a
couple
of
the
mayorunas
were
awake
and
looking
out
but
the
sight
of
the
sentinel
strolling
up
and
down
in
apparent
unconcern
and
the
absence
of
light
in
the
gradually
quieted
the
suspicions
on
both
sides
of
the
water
soon
the
red
bones
squatted
again
and
the
mayorunas
lay
back
with
minds
at
ease
then
a
dim
sheen
of
light
showed
for
a
time
at
the
back
of
the
white
men
shelter
fading
out
after
a
few
minutes
into
the
usual
gloom
mckay
had
pulled
a
blanket
over
himself
and
the
unconscious
man
masking
his
torch
glare
from
any
watching
eye
while
he
studied
the
face
and
form
of
the
invader
after
the
faint
radiance
vanished
certain
sounds
came
to
the
sentry
ears
then
mckay
tall
figure
loomed
in
the
vague
moonshine
knowlton
stopped
beside
him
it
rand
the
captain
vouchsafed
in
an
undertone
no
question
of
it
features
identical
though
face
is
drawn
white
hair
mark
broken
nose
green
eyes
i
opened
one
eye
got
a
bad
foot
partly
healed
looks
as
if
he
torn
it
on
a
stub
poor
devil
seems
nearly
starved
so
then
that
why
he
sneaked
in
like
that
wanted
to
steal
some
grub
those
mutts
over
yonder
probably
have
fed
him
since
he
got
hurt
that
it
he
had
to
do
his
own
foraging
and
his
foot
has
given
him
mighty
little
chance
damn
those
brutes
right
but
now
what
look
out
that
he
does
sneak
away
again
he
wo
i
tied
his
feet
he
in
pedro
hammock
still
dead
to
the
world
if
he
wakes
up
and
starts
to
yell
i
gag
him
we
got
to
get
away
now
as
soon
as
we
can
how
do
know
by
water
perhaps
wish
those
bushman
were
here
heard
any
noise
over
there
have
you
all
quiet
they
safe
or
dead
hm
confounded
foolishness
anyway
but
we
no
means
of
getting
out
until
they
back
could
desert
them
besides
what
time
is
it
you
go
on
watch
at
midnight
i
on
watch
now
inside
they
may
be
back
any
time
if
they
do
show
up
in
the
next
couple
of
hours
i
send
tucu
to
find
out
why
have
to
get
those
canoes
over
here
too
water
leaves
no
trail
he
turned
back
into
the
hut
leaving
knowlton
figuring
chances
to
obtain
those
canoes
was
a
job
to
put
the
red
bone
guards
out
of
action
without
arousing
the
whole
tribe
was
an
even
bigger
job
but
no
boats
could
be
brought
over
until
the
outpost
was
silenced
that
was
sure
another
crept
past
still
no
noise
from
the
town
no
suspicious
move
on
the
other
shore
then
from
the
itself
came
a
low
mumble
of
voices
knowlton
stepped
swiftly
into
it
as
noiselessly
as
they
had
gone
the
two
bushmen
had
returned
in
his
usual
concise
phrases
mckay
was
informing
them
of
the
capture
of
the
raposa
with
his
back
to
the
stream
and
the
flashlight
held
close
to
his
body
he
played
the
light
for
an
instant
on
the
face
of
the
still
unconscious
man
then
once
more
in
darkness
he
asserted
now
that
we
have
him
we
must
get
out
of
here
only
chance
to
do
that
is
to
get
the
canoes
with
them
we
can
at
least
be
away
from
this
town
by
sunrise
and
it
will
take
the
red
bones
just
so
much
longer
to
find
our
trail
where
we
take
to
the
bush
we
get
a
flying
start
that
way
anything
else
to
suggest
that
is
the
best
plan
capitao
lourenço
agreed
for
the
first
time
since
the
americans
had
known
him
his
voice
held
a
note
of
suppressed
excitement
it
is
the
only
plan
worth
while
and
i
do
not
think
we
shall
have
to
take
to
our
legs
soon
if
at
all
i
believe
this
creek
connects
with
that
which
flows
past
the
monitaya
we
have
learned
some
things
deus
if
only
we
had
known
the
raposa
was
here
why
because
then
we
could
have
brought
company
with
us
senhores
guess
what
the
barred
house
holds
well
women
of
the
mayorunas
girls
stolen
from
monitaya
and
other
settlements
jumping
judas
ejaculated
knowlton
are
you
sure
sure
comrades
these
foul
red
bones
are
the
men
who
have
been
lurking
around
the
mayoruna
tribe
houses
and
capturing
girls
who
went
into
the
bush
they
have
taken
the
prisoners
to
the
water
where
the
trails
always
were
lost
and
where
they
could
find
hiding
places
until
night
then
drive
their
canoes
past
the
clearings
and
get
out
of
that
country
so
there
must
be
some
water
connection
by
which
these
men
travel
and
by
which
we
too
can
travel
if
we
go
downstream
we
are
almost
sure
to
find
it
by
daylight
but
why
what
the
idea
of
their
stealing
the
girls
for
victims
if
so
how
are
the
girls
still
alive
do
you
not
see
senhor
pedro
broke
in
impatiently
did
not
umanuh
ask
if
we
would
pay
more
than
the
other
blackbeard
for
the
raposa
what
other
blackbeard
schwandorf
the
americans
blurted
simultaneously
not
so
loud
schwandorf
of
course
umanuh
works
with
the
german
he
catches
girls
by
stealth
and
sells
them
to
the
german
to
add
to
his
slave
gangs
while
the
mayorunas
all
blame
the
peruvians
for
the
disappearances
umanuh
works
unsuspected
he
is
holding
these
women
until
schwandorf
comes
again
and
it
may
be
that
schwandorf
is
not
far
off
at
this
moment
now
that
we
have
come
seeking
the
wild
man
umanuh
at
once
thinks
of
selling
him
also
and
he
wonders
whether
we
or
schwandorf
will
pay
the
more
for
him
by
thunder
i
believe
you
right
knowlton
coincided
he
stalling
for
time
holding
us
here
while
schwandorf
comes
up
i
bet
no
wonder
he
and
his
men
are
wary
of
the
mayorunas
they
thought
we
come
to
snoop
around
and
catch
with
the
goods
you
fellows
must
have
done
a
mighty
slick
job
to
find
out
this
stuff
without
getting
caught
the
house
guarded
at
night
indeed
it
is
two
clubmen
are
there
now
and
there
is
only
the
one
door
not
even
a
window
but
lourenço
worked
a
small
hole
between
two
logs
at
the
back
while
i
watched
the
clubmen
and
through
the
hole
he
whispered
with
one
of
the
women
inside
if
only
we
had
known
the
wild
man
was
here
we
could
have
jumped
the
guards
and
tried
to
bring
back
the
women
but
of
course
your
business
about
the
raposa
had
to
be
thought
of
first
so
all
we
could
do
was
to
tell
them
friends
were
here
for
a
few
seconds
there
was
the
silence
of
thought
then
knowlton
chuckled
i
say
we
have
our
hands
full
this
night
now
we
not
only
have
to
get
ourselves
and
rand
out
of
here
but
also
rescue
the
fair
damsels
from
the
clutches
of
the
ogre
do
to
leave
them
here
while
we
go
back
to
monitaya
and
get
the
rest
of
his
army
by
the
time
we
could
come
back
they
be
gone
one
way
or
another
what
done
has
to
be
done
now
or
never
right
mckay
commended
we
have
to
save
the
women
of
course
question
is
how
lourenço
answered
at
once
my
idea
capitao
is
this
we
two
will
return
with
us
we
will
take
tucu
the
three
of
us
can
handle
those
guards
quietly
we
must
have
tucu
because
the
women
do
not
know
us
and
might
balk
at
the
last
moment
women
are
queer
creatures
and
these
might
think
themselves
safer
inside
prison
walls
than
following
two
strange
men
through
the
night
but
tucu
can
handle
them
when
once
we
are
clear
of
the
houses
tucu
can
lead
the
women
to
the
bank
above
here
and
we
shall
try
for
the
canoes
then
it
will
be
fast
work
to
get
away
but
if
we
have
good
fortune
it
can
be
done
confound
it
you
fellows
are
taking
all
the
risks
ca
you
take
more
men
no
no
man
but
tucu
he
has
a
cool
head
these
others
if
they
knew
would
go
and
attack
the
red
bones
to
avenge
their
lost
women
and
so
would
get
us
all
killed
now
i
will
talk
with
tucu
he
slipped
into
the
mayoruna
shelter
and
returned
with
the
cannibal
leader
whom
he
led
to
the
far
side
of
the
before
speaking
then
in
whispers
which
the
other
tribesmen
could
not
overhear
he
explained
the
situation
knowlton
took
another
turn
or
two
along
his
post
finding
that
the
red
bones
across
the
water
were
stirring
about
and
evidently
aware
that
something
was
going
on
but
they
made
no
move
either
to
get
into
a
canoe
or
to
send
a
man
to
the
houses
beyond
as
he
stopped
again
at
the
corner
near
the
whispering
pair
he
heard
tucu
grinding
his
teeth
and
as
the
savage
turned
his
face
toward
the
red
bone
outpost
it
was
a
mask
of
murder
but
he
spoke
no
word
as
he
slipped
back
to
his
own
men
he
will
wake
another
man
and
tell
him
what
to
do
lourenço
explained
but
only
we
four
shall
know
of
the
women
until
they
are
freed
will
one
of
you
lend
tucu
a
machete
he
may
need
a
weapon
and
he
can
not
carry
his
big
bow
on
this
trip
a
few
minutes
later
the
three
crept
out
behind
the
tucu
gripping
mckay
machete
as
a
final
word
lourenço
said
our
men
here
may
move
about
a
little
after
a
time
but
do
not
try
to
keep
them
quiet
it
is
a
part
of
the
plan
with
that
he
was
gone
listen
as
they
might
the
americans
could
hear
no
sound
to
indicate
that
three
men
now
were
traversing
the
black
tangle
beyond
mckay
took
up
his
rifle
and
assumed
the
sentry
work
knowlton
sat
in
his
hammock
grateful
for
the
chance
to
rest
his
weary
legs
from
the
hammock
where
the
raposa
lay
no
sound
came
with
a
worried
frown
the
lieutenant
leaned
over
him
and
laid
hand
on
his
heart
after
a
while
he
sat
up
again
in
relief
lord
i
sure
knocked
him
cold
was
his
thought
but
he
still
with
us
and
there
no
use
in
reviving
him
now
the
less
noise
over
here
the
better
hope
i
did
jar
his
brains
loose
altogether
he
might
wake
up
a
murderous
maniac
poor
devil
a
millionaire
yet
half
starved
and
more
than
half
nutty
he
glanced
at
the
dim
scene
before
the
hut
the
moon
now
had
journeyed
so
far
westward
that
the
creeping
shadows
of
the
tall
trees
had
moved
out
almost
to
the
creek
and
the
two
crude
shelters
and
the
sentinel
were
surrounded
by
dense
gloom
the
red
bone
men
opposite
must
rely
on
their
ears
alone
hereafter
for
they
could
not
see
through
this
darkness
mckay
was
visible
enough
to
his
own
party
but
not
to
the
enemy
the
blond
man
in
the
hammock
watched
the
somber
figure
of
his
comrade
followed
the
flight
of
a
big
firefly
whose
light
floated
near
thought
of
the
two
bushmen
out
in
the
dark
and
looked
again
at
the
still
form
of
rand
drifters
all
he
soliloquized
the
fireflies
and
rod
and
tim
and
i
and
those
brazilian
all
floating
around
because
we
keep
still
and
never
getting
anywhere
and
you
you
rand
have
a
mint
waiting
for
you
up
home
and
we
have
to
come
find
you
and
lead
you
up
there
and
shove
your
nose
into
it
and
if
you
get
your
brains
back
you
be
a
nine
days
wonder
and
a
hero
of
the
jungle
and
all
that
and
the
girls
will
all
tumble
over
you
because
you
got
a
couple
of
millions
in
your
sock
and
we
fellows
who
yanked
you
out
of
hell
by
the
left
hind
leg
can
pocket
our
pay
and
go
jump
off
the
dock
for
all
anybody
cares
all
the
same
i
rather
be
me
than
you
old
thing
free
to
drift
and
able
to
handle
myself
you
can
have
the
money
and
the
moths
that
hang
around
it
with
which
he
yawned
squinted
again
at
the
sinister
figure
squatting
out
yonder
in
the
moonshine
arose
and
made
himself
useful
working
very
quietly
he
took
down
three
of
the
hammocks
rolled
them
up
laid
them
at
the
corner
nearest
the
creek
made
up
the
packs
by
sense
of
touch
and
placed
them
and
the
rifles
of
the
absent
pair
in
the
same
place
then
he
lifted
the
raposa
from
the
one
remaining
hammock
laid
him
on
the
packs
rolled
up
the
hammock
itself
and
put
it
under
the
unconscious
man
head
if
given
time
when
the
crisis
came
he
meant
to
save
all
equipment
if
not
rand
lay
where
he
could
be
grabbed
without
delay
before
he
completed
the
work
he
became
aware
that
the
mayorunas
all
were
awake
not
only
awake
but
moving
stealthily
about
as
lourenço
had
predicted
mckay
also
knew
it
and
stepped
back
into
the
hut
where
knowlton
told
him
what
he
had
done
but
so
softly
did
the
men
of
monitaya
move
that
the
red
bone
watchers
showed
no
sign
of
alarm
both
the
americans
observed
however
that
the
cannibals
across
the
stream
had
their
heads
together
and
that
occasionally
one
looked
up
at
the
little
moon
get
that
rod
they
waiting
for
the
shadows
to
crawl
over
there
and
cover
them
and
the
water
they
know
that
then
we
ca
see
what
up
to
i
betting
they
intend
to
pull
some
dirty
work
after
that
yep
but
intention
and
accomplishment
are
two
different
birds
wonder
what
these
mayorunas
are
fixing
to
do
wish
i
could
talk
their
language
tucu
evidently
left
orders
for
them
to
get
up
at
a
certain
time
but
why
i
do
know
we
better
let
them
alone
the
shadow
line
passed
out
upon
the
water
slipping
by
infinitesimal
gradations
across
its
mirror
surface
the
mayorunas
had
become
quiet
the
whites
waited
in
silent
suspense
for
they
knew
not
what
far
out
in
the
forest
a
jaguar
gave
his
coughing
roar
at
intervals
little
by
little
the
red
bone
men
arose
from
their
squat
until
they
stood
erect
a
tense
stillness
held
both
forces
and
the
shadows
crawled
on
on
and
reached
the
farther
bank
then
a
red
bone
man
shoved
his
head
forward
squinting
upstream
as
if
he
had
heard
something
move
in
the
rank
grass
he
began
to
sneak
softly
in
that
direction
at
that
moment
from
the
water
edge
a
little
above
the
camp
sounded
a
loud
hiss
before
the
sound
died
a
sudden
thrum
of
bow
cords
filled
the
air
a
whisper
of
shafts
speeding
over
the
water
a
series
of
tiny
impacts
a
couple
of
short
groans
the
thumps
of
falling
bodies
and
the
red
bone
outpost
was
no
more
shot
through
and
through
by
the
deadly
war
arrows
of
the
mayorunas
they
were
dead
before
they
struck
the
ground
and
from
the
men
of
monitaya
sounded
one
short
subdued
hah
of
savage
satisfaction
up
from
the
ground
where
that
hiss
had
sounded
rose
a
tall
figure
which
waved
its
arms
and
danced
about
in
impromptu
signals
then
it
ran
for
the
canoes
out
from
the
gloom
upstream
other
figures
took
shape
running
fast
for
the
same
point
with
one
simultaneous
movement
knowlton
and
mckay
seized
the
raposa
and
rushed
with
him
to
the
stream
senhores
sounded
pedro
voice
low
but
tense
across
the
water
be
ready
ready
and
waiting
snapped
mckay
who
are
those
people
your
women
we
are
not
discovered
across
his
words
smote
a
long
shrill
yell
from
the
town
we
discovered
get
our
rifles
for
the
love
of
he
leaped
into
a
canoe
drove
it
headlong
across
and
dived
for
the
behind
him
the
other
figures
dashed
panting
up
to
the
landing
tucu
voice
rasped
in
swift
commands
the
fugitives
swarmed
into
other
dugouts
the
mayoruna
men
still
ignorant
of
the
identity
of
these
people
but
assured
by
tucu
voice
and
manner
that
they
were
not
enemies
lowered
their
weapons
and
rushed
for
the
water
up
in
the
town
the
yelling
swiftly
grew
into
a
roar
and
running
figures
came
pelting
toward
the
creek
the
canoes
struck
the
bank
some
were
partly
filled
some
empty
and
in
tow
into
pedro
canoe
the
whites
bundled
the
raposa
while
the
mayorunas
got
into
anything
within
reach
lourenço
appeared
from
nowhere
and
urged
the
americans
to
open
fire
as
he
spoke
arrows
thudded
into
the
ground
and
the
water
take
this
man
and
go
rasped
mckay
we
losing
our
equipment
but
his
rifle
leaped
to
his
shoulder
flame
spat
from
it
from
the
van
of
the
charging
red
bones
shrilled
a
death
scream
again
and
again
the
captain
gun
cracked
knowlton
joined
in
before
their
rifles
grew
silent
the
blunt
roar
of
pedro
repeater
broke
out
and
with
the
emptying
of
their
long
guns
the
americans
drew
their
short
ones
and
in
a
concerted
ripping
crash
the
volleyed
death
and
dismay
into
the
oncoming
cannibals
the
rush
was
checked
for
a
few
seconds
the
red
bones
wavered
and
milled
about
into
their
mass
poured
a
cloud
of
arrows
and
blowgun
darts
from
the
silent
but
no
less
deadly
weapons
of
the
mayorunas
as
the
whites
paused
to
reload
pedro
opened
a
new
blast
from
lourenço
rifle
which
his
comrade
had
passed
to
him
on
the
run
lourenço
was
not
shooting
but
working
madly
and
alone
to
save
the
equipment
and
thanks
to
the
renewed
deadly
fire
of
the
guns
he
saved
it
before
the
wicked
belch
of
the
three
rifles
and
the
two
automatics
the
red
bones
gave
back
more
and
more
their
arrows
plunged
all
around
the
fighting
men
but
they
fell
at
random
for
the
gunmen
and
the
canoes
were
virtually
invisible
in
the
deep
shadows
downstream
tucu
harsh
voice
jarred
in
commands
as
he
straightened
out
the
line
of
boats
at
the
next
lull
in
the
firing
lourenço
panted
in
comrades
we
are
loaded
in
great
guns
are
you
still
here
snapped
mckay
i
told
you
in
talk
later
come
the
three
gun
fighters
swiftly
obeyed
with
a
powerful
heave
lourenço
sent
the
canoe
after
the
others
americans
brazilians
and
the
raposa
hunched
up
among
the
packs
all
went
sliding
down
a
jungle
styx
a
moment
later
the
red
bone
warriors
taking
heart
from
the
cessation
of
firing
poured
an
avalanche
of
arrows
into
the
spot
where
they
had
been
and
as
the
canoe
last
in
the
escaping
line
was
swallowed
up
in
the
impenetrable
blackness
of
the
forest
a
screech
of
diabolical
fury
blended
with
a
swift
succession
of
splashes
back
where
the
cannibals
were
plunging
headlong
into
the
stream
to
reach
the
dead
or
wounded
men
whom
they
vainly
hoped
to
find
on
the
farther
shore
i
told
you
to
take
this
man
and
go
mckay
fumed
by
disobeying
orders
you
risked
losing
him
oh
pipe
down
rod
remonstrated
knowlton
if
they
had
where
we
be
now
this
was
the
last
canoe
it
is
so
added
lourenço
his
voice
hard
edged
as
it
is
the
man
and
the
equipment
and
you
also
are
here
and
let
me
tell
you
this
capitao
makkay
whether
you
like
it
or
not
pedro
and
i
would
see
this
wild
man
and
a
million
others
like
him
in
a
hotter
place
than
this
before
we
would
abandon
fighting
comrades
to
which
mckay
finding
no
adequate
answer
made
none
whatever
chapter
xxii
the
siren
of
war
like
a
fleet
manned
by
sightless
sailors
the
line
of
boats
blundered
on
through
the
blackness
with
no
guiding
light
the
canoes
bumped
the
banks
and
collided
with
one
another
in
perilous
confusion
speed
was
impossible
yet
speed
was
imperative
knowlton
and
his
little
flashlight
solved
the
problem
say
fellows
let
take
the
lead
he
suggested
this
little
light
is
much
but
it
something
and
there
are
some
extra
batteries
in
my
haversack
when
this
burns
out
we
can
see
a
little
way
ahead
and
pass
back
the
word
to
the
rest
what
say
terra
dos
cegos
quem
tem
um
olho
e
in
blindman
land
he
who
has
one
eye
is
king
said
pedro
that
little
white
eye
in
your
box
may
save
us
all
lourenço
tell
those
ahead
to
let
us
pass
without
question
the
preceding
dugouts
swerved
and
the
boat
of
the
white
men
slipped
by
at
the
head
of
the
line
they
found
tucu
and
his
crew
struggling
manfully
to
make
progress
without
wrecking
the
whole
fleet
at
the
turns
vast
relief
and
instant
acceptance
of
the
new
leadership
followed
lourenço
explanation
at
once
the
floating
column
began
to
pick
up
speed
and
it
was
well
that
it
did
howls
of
baffled
hate
came
faintly
through
the
tree
mass
from
the
red
bone
town
some
time
later
more
yells
of
rage
sounded
much
nearer
back
at
a
place
on
the
creek
which
the
last
boat
had
cleared
only
a
few
minutes
previously
some
of
the
umanuh
men
had
made
torches
and
run
along
one
of
the
red
bone
trails
to
a
bend
in
the
stream
only
to
find
the
water
bare
of
everything
but
dying
ripples
whether
the
enemy
attempted
to
follow
in
canoes
the
escaping
party
never
knew
for
none
succeeded
in
overtaking
the
rearmost
boat
and
after
that
one
snarling
uproar
on
the
creek
bank
they
heard
no
more
of
the
land
pursuit
the
narrow
margin
of
safety
gained
by
the
aid
of
the
flashlight
proved
enough
to
give
a
commanding
lead
and
from
that
time
on
the
only
obstacles
to
their
retreat
were
those
of
darkness
and
winding
waters
hour
after
hour
knowlton
squatted
in
the
extreme
bow
picking
out
the
turns
and
snags
just
ahead
and
passing
the
word
back
to
lourenço
who
in
the
stern
steered
in
accordance
with
his
orders
and
relayed
the
course
to
tucu
just
behind
amidships
pedro
and
mckay
plied
steady
paddles
and
the
raposa
lay
all
but
forgotten
on
the
baggage
there
were
no
halts
if
any
boat
back
in
the
blackness
got
into
difficulties
it
extricated
itself
as
best
it
could
unaided
by
the
rest
and
fell
into
a
new
place
in
the
column
at
last
a
wan
light
which
was
scarcely
a
light
but
rather
a
lessening
of
the
density
came
about
the
stream
the
renewed
racket
of
birds
and
beasts
announced
that
up
overhead
the
sky
had
paled
into
dawn
slowly
the
nearest
tree
trunks
began
to
take
shape
in
the
void
and
presently
the
shore
line
became
visible
to
all
eyes
at
the
same
time
tiny
lamp
dimmed
and
faded
out
another
battery
gone
he
announced
opening
the
case
and
dropping
its
contents
into
the
creek
gee
i
all
in
eyes
feel
like
a
couple
of
burnt
holes
well
gents
i
move
that
at
the
first
available
spot
we
go
ashore
feed
our
faces
look
at
the
ladies
and
perform
our
morning
salute
to
umanuh
said
salute
consisting
of
applying
the
right
thumb
to
the
end
of
the
nose
and
snappily
twiddling
four
fingers
motion
carried
mckay
set
face
relaxed
then
his
glance
dropping
to
the
raposa
it
tightened
again
oh
hullo
rand
how
you
feeling
the
unconscious
man
was
unconscious
no
longer
moreover
his
expression
was
not
that
of
one
just
emerging
from
a
stupor
and
bewildered
as
to
his
surroundings
though
he
had
made
no
movement
to
change
his
position
his
eyes
indicated
that
he
had
been
awake
for
some
time
they
dwelt
steadily
on
mckay
then
strayed
past
the
captain
to
pedro
lourenço
and
the
first
mayoruna
crew
following
a
few
feet
behind
his
face
was
inscrutable
and
he
spoke
no
word
you
with
friends
understand
friends
you
going
home
these
indians
are
friends
too
get
that
the
green
eyes
hung
on
mckay
face
again
but
as
before
no
answer
came
in
word
movement
or
expression
no
good
rod
said
knowlton
who
could
not
see
the
rescued
man
face
but
watched
mckay
i
knocked
his
last
brains
down
his
throat
dead
from
the
neck
up
i
do
know
about
that
he
does
look
vacant
see
here
rand
going
to
land
and
eat
you
hungry
thought
you
understand
that
he
alive
merry
maybe
not
all
here
but
enough
to
get
us
good
the
blond
man
turned
his
attention
downstream
again
soon
he
suggested
how
about
landing
at
that
little
open
space
down
there
at
the
left
lourenço
very
good
senhor
it
looks
dry
the
canoe
swerved
and
floated
down
to
a
spot
on
the
left
shore
where
bright
light
poured
down
from
an
opening
in
the
overhead
wall
of
foliage
now
look
here
rand
warned
the
captain
we
untie
you
but
if
you
try
to
duck
into
the
bush
now
or
later
you
get
shot
shot
understand
he
tapped
his
pistol
and
the
gray
eyes
boring
into
the
green
ones
were
hard
as
chilled
steel
for
the
first
time
rand
responded
a
slow
short
nod
mckay
cut
the
cord
around
the
wild
man
ankles
then
stepped
ashore
and
held
out
a
hand
rand
arose
quietly
jumped
to
the
earth
unassisted
lifted
his
bad
foot
and
stared
at
it
then
limped
onward
into
a
spot
where
the
sun
now
shone
bright
and
warm
and
sat
down
to
bask
have
to
fix
that
foot
i
expect
yawned
knowlton
but
my
eyes
right
now
are
one
solid
ache
and
i
going
to
rest
them
watch
him
will
you
rod
ca
tell
what
he
might
do
of
course
you
would
shoot
him
but
would
i
not
to
kill
no
but
if
he
makes
one
break
i
drill
a
leg
for
him
he
going
to
the
states
sure
i
with
you
all
the
way
now
beat
it
and
let
me
repose
myself
he
bathed
his
eyes
then
lay
down
in
the
canoe
with
a
wet
handkerchief
across
them
pedro
and
lourenço
already
were
ashore
and
raiding
the
slender
packs
for
food
the
mayorunas
were
debarking
and
watching
each
new
boat
as
it
drew
up
their
eyes
on
the
women
who
had
wielded
paddles
with
them
but
whose
faces
they
now
saw
closely
for
the
first
time
in
the
shaft
of
sunlight
mckay
stood
tall
and
forbidding
rifle
in
the
crook
of
one
arm
hat
pulled
low
guarding
the
gaunt
man
at
his
feet
and
viewing
the
landing
of
the
expedition
the
women
all
young
numbered
eleven
their
skins
looked
slightly
pallid
their
eyes
too
big
and
black
their
faces
somewhat
drawn
the
results
of
close
confinement
and
anxiety
but
none
showed
any
sign
of
abuse
for
commercial
reasons
alone
umanuh
had
seen
to
it
that
the
woman
flesh
he
held
for
sale
should
remain
uninjured
now
saved
from
the
slave
trail
or
worse
the
girls
showed
no
more
emotion
than
if
on
a
mere
journey
after
turtles
or
fish
a
few
spoke
to
men
whom
they
evidently
knew
others
gathered
in
a
dumb
cluster
and
awaited
whatever
might
come
next
with
these
tucu
talked
in
gruff
monosyllables
when
all
were
ashore
a
dozen
of
the
men
went
into
the
jungle
to
hunt
the
others
sought
firewood
inspected
weapons
talked
with
one
another
and
with
the
girls
who
stared
at
mckay
and
asked
who
he
was
a
number
of
the
warriors
looked
sourly
at
rand
whose
face
still
bore
the
red
bone
tribal
streaks
which
now
to
mayoruna
minds
was
the
insignia
of
the
enemy
all
knew
he
was
the
man
who
had
been
sought
all
saw
that
he
was
not
a
red
bone
but
a
white
man
yet
their
mental
reaction
to
the
sight
of
the
sinister
red
cross
on
the
forehead
and
the
straight
cheek
lines
was
rabidly
hostile
mckay
decided
to
wash
face
for
him
before
journeying
much
farther
but
rand
himself
gave
no
sign
that
he
either
knew
or
cared
what
the
feeling
of
the
mayorunas
might
be
utterly
impassive
he
stared
back
at
them
then
one
of
the
women
pointed
at
him
and
said
something
to
tucu
the
tall
watchdog
jaw
set
a
little
harder
as
he
waited
the
effect
somewhat
to
his
surprise
tucu
and
a
couple
of
the
other
men
now
gave
rand
a
more
friendly
look
soon
afterward
tucu
passed
lourenço
who
talked
with
him
a
few
minutes
catching
the
brazilian
eye
the
captain
motioned
him
nearer
and
asked
for
any
news
tucu
says
capitao
that
most
of
these
girls
are
from
other
than
that
of
monitaya
though
some
of
monitaya
women
also
are
here
and
one
of
them
says
this
man
the
raposa
tried
to
release
them
a
short
time
ago
and
was
nearly
killed
by
the
red
bones
for
it
they
let
him
live
only
because
he
is
crazy
and
they
fear
to
kill
a
crazy
man
what
he
tried
to
get
them
clear
yes
he
opened
the
door
and
motioned
for
them
to
run
but
before
they
could
escape
they
were
caught
he
was
badly
beaten
you
will
remember
that
he
was
hiding
behind
that
same
house
when
pedro
and
senhor
knowlton
saw
him
perhaps
he
meant
to
try
again
hm
crazy
and
wild
but
a
white
man
for
all
that
how
did
you
manage
to
free
the
women
very
simple
was
the
cool
answer
we
stabbed
the
guards
opened
the
door
and
came
back
to
the
creek
with
the
women
just
like
that
eh
and
the
guards
made
no
resistance
i
suppose
not
much
grinned
the
bushman
they
were
not
allowed
to
i
see
very
simple
as
you
say
about
as
simple
as
our
calm
and
unhurried
departure
something
like
that
capitao
what
do
you
desire
for
breakfast
salt
fish
and
coffee
or
coffee
and
salt
fish
a
little
of
everything
thanks
here
comes
some
monkey
meat
too
the
first
of
the
hunters
had
returned
bringing
two
big
red
howlers
others
drifted
in
at
intervals
and
not
one
returned
empty
handed
for
here
in
the
virgin
jungle
the
game
was
plentiful
particularly
at
this
early
hour
soon
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
odor
of
broiling
meat
and
from
the
fire
of
the
brazilians
the
fragrance
of
coffee
was
wafted
to
the
nostrils
of
the
recumbent
knowlton
he
arose
swallowing
fast
gee
i
half
drowned
was
his
humorous
complaint
the
smell
of
eats
makes
my
mouth
water
so
fast
i
have
to
gasp
for
air
must
tickle
your
nose
too
eh
rand
old
top
rand
famished
though
he
was
gave
no
sign
of
assent
or
of
hunger
in
fact
he
gave
no
sign
of
anything
stoically
he
sat
eyes
front
by
thunder
the
man
got
pride
the
lieutenant
added
in
a
lower
tone
almost
ready
to
keel
over
from
lack
of
food
but
stiff
as
a
indian
darned
if
i
not
beginning
to
respect
him
tucu
approached
carrying
two
big
monkey
haunches
one
he
offered
to
mckay
the
other
to
rand
the
latter
immobility
vanished
in
a
flash
with
a
lightning
grab
he
seized
the
proffered
meat
and
sank
his
teeth
in
it
as
he
wolfed
down
the
tough
flesh
the
three
men
standing
over
exchanged
glances
tucu
laid
a
hand
on
his
stomach
and
pressed
inward
signifying
that
the
man
had
long
gone
hungry
the
others
nodded
then
they
split
the
other
haunch
between
them
and
fell
to
gnawing
lourenço
bringing
coffee
to
the
captain
asked
tucu
in
what
direction
the
monitaya
houses
lay
without
hesitation
the
indian
pointed
off
to
the
left
the
brazilian
glanced
at
the
creek
estimating
its
general
direction
and
rate
of
flow
then
returned
to
his
fire
offered
coffee
rand
took
it
and
sipped
it
with
evident
relish
likewise
he
accepted
a
cigarette
which
he
puffed
like
a
man
just
learning
to
smoke
or
one
who
has
not
smoked
for
years
for
his
meat
his
drink
and
his
smoke
he
gave
no
indication
of
gratitude
his
attitude
was
as
indifferent
and
as
if
he
were
one
of
the
mayorunas
when
his
smoke
was
ended
he
began
inspecting
his
bad
foot
let
see
that
said
knowlton
dropping
on
one
knee
looks
pretty
sore
yes
it
more
than
sore
it
infected
how
you
get
it
anyway
no
answer
knowlton
probed
his
face
keenly
rand
straightened
out
his
legs
wriggled
his
toes
and
scowled
queer
muttered
the
lieutenant
rising
he
looks
as
if
he
actually
did
know
how
he
got
that
wound
you
think
he
remember
that
much
anyhow
i
sure
am
afraid
his
head
is
all
scrambled
up
he
went
to
the
canoe
returned
with
his
meager
medical
kit
and
knelt
again
now
listen
here
rand
i
do
know
how
well
you
understand
me
but
taking
the
chance
this
foot
has
to
be
opened
up
and
cleaned
out
otherwise

to
have
serious
trouble
with
it
i
going
to
hurt
you
if
you
raise
a
row
you
get
an
anæsthetic
a
swift
punch
under
the
ear
better
sit
still
and
make
no
fuss
with
which
he
went
to
work
he
did
a
thorough
job
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
it
hurt
but
rand
gave
no
trouble
nor
even
a
sign
of
pain
except
that
he
dug
his
fingers
into
the
dirt
good
boy
the
amateur
surgeon
approved
when
he
finished
you
a
spartan
if
you
happen
to
remember
what
that
is
now
we
move
on
but
before
we
go
wash
your
face
good
and
hard
get
that
tribe
paint
off
these
indians
with
us
do
like
it
you
no
indian
anyhow
white
like
us
savvy
white
man
wash
off
paint
he
rolled
up
his
kit
and
returned
to
the
canoe
the
mayorunas
men
and
women
were
entering
their
own
craft
rand
sat
motionless
a
moment
mckay
and
the
brazilians
watching
him
keenly
slowly
then
he
got
up
of
his
own
accord
limped
to
the
water
edge
and
began
to
scrub
his
face
when
he
desisted
the
marks
still
showed
for
the
red
dye
clung
stubbornly
to
his
skin
but
they
were
fainter
than
before
the
other
men
eyed
him
thoughtfully
none
speaking
he
settled
himself
in
his
former
place
curled
up
and
began
to
doze
a
queer
fish
pedro
said
softly
is
he
crazy
or
not
hanged
if
i
know
replied
mckay
he
no
maniac
anyhow
i
give
real
money
to
know
just
what
his
mental
condition
is
but
we
can
forget
him
for
a
while
i
going
to
let
you
fellows
sleep
by
turns
now
i
had
some
sleep
last
night
you
had
none
at
all
merry
your
eyes
need
rest
you
curl
up
in
the
bow
and
snooze
one
hour
then
another
man
and
so
on
and
how
about
letting
tucu
lead
the
parade
again
excellent
capitao
i
was
thinking
of
that
lourenço
talked
to
tucu
who
swung
out
into
the
current
the
boat
of
the
white
men
followed
then
the
others
at
a
steady
cruising
speed
the
brigade
surged
on
downstream
knowlton
allotted
hour
passed
pedro
took
his
place
and
was
instantly
asleep
in
turn
he
was
aroused
and
lourenço
laid
down
his
paddle
but
just
then
tucu
canoe
slowed
and
floated
in
to
the
left
bank
the
others
backed
water
and
looked
at
a
very
narrow
ravine
almost
a
cleft
in
a
rising
hillside
through
it
led
a
lane
of
water
from
the
third
boat
in
which
were
two
women
of
the
monitaya
tribe
now
came
voices
carrying
information
to
the
indian
leader
at
once
he
turned
his
boat
into
the
cleft
this
is
the
connection
we
have
been
seeking
lourenço
explained
the
women
say
the
boats
of
their
captors
came
through
this
crack
in
the
hill
at
the
end
we
shall
find
the
creek
of
monitaya
the
women
spoke
truth
after
threading
their
way
along
the
weedy
which
was
barely
wide
enough
to
give
passage
for
the
boats
they
emerged
at
a
slant
into
another
stream
down
this
with
the
sure
instinct
for
direction
of
the
hereditary
tucu
turned
his
prow
without
asking
the
women
whether
to
go
with
or
against
the
current
once
more
on
the
waters
of
their
home
creek
the
mayorunas
quickened
their
strokes
and
howled
merrily
on
toward
their
lourenço
took
his
nap
and
resumed
his
place
hour
after
hour
the
fleet
sped
on
noon
passed
without
a
halt
the
paddlers
munching
at
whatever
fragments
remained
from
breakfast
by
turns
the
americans
and
brazilians
each
got
another
hour
sleep
mckay
consenting
to
relax
when
all
his
mates
had
rested
rand
dozed
and
awoke
at
intervals
seeming
content
and
comfortable
despite
his
cramped
position
by
four
even
the
mayorunas
began
to
lag
in
their
strokes
excluding
the
halt
at
sunrise
they
now
had
been
journeying
for
fifteen
hours
in
the
last
nine
of
which
they
had
covered
many
miles
of
serpentine
water
the
heat
of
the
day
and
the
constant
drive
of
the
paddles
had
taken
their
toll
and
now
the
body
of
every
man
fiercely
demanded
more
food
mckay
knowing
that
in
jungle
travel
distance
is
not
a
matter
of
miles
but
of
hours
had
begun
to
figure
that
the
journey
which
had
taken
nearly
five
days
of
overland
work
might
be
completed
that
night
by
the
swiftly
moving
canoes
but
now
recognizing
the
signs
of
exhaustion
he
realized
that
without
some
powerful
spur
the
indians
would
not
attempt
to
reach
the
home
until
the
morrow
then
the
spur
came
even
as
tucu
began
scanning
the
shores
for
a
good
camp
site
he
and
every
other
mayoruna
suddenly
ceased
paddling
and
threw
up
his
head
faint
and
far
a
xylophonic
call
of
beaten
wooden
bars
rapped
across
the
jungle
rising
and
falling
in
swift
regular
cadence
a
sirenical
flow
and
ebb
of
sound
waves
over
and
over
it
undulated
rapid
incessant
imperative
a
chorus
of
excited
grunts
broke
from
the
canoe
brigade
the
dugout
of
tucu
leaped
away
like
a
roweled
horse
lourenço
and
pedro
buried
their
paddles
in
mighty
strokes
hurling
their
boat
ahead
to
keep
from
being
run
down
by
those
behind
lourenço
barked
at
tucu
who
flung
back
an
answer
paddle
hard
capitao
if
we
do
not
keep
up
we
shall
be
wrecked
that
message
is
the
war
call
of
the
mayorunas
calling
in
the
hunters
from
the
forest
to
take
arms
against
an
enemy
we
must
race
now
with
these
madmen
around
us
or
we
go
under
paddle
chapter
xxiii
strategy
in
the
last
light
of
the
day
the
canoes
darted
from
the
forest
into
the
clearing
where
stood
the
monitaya
long
before
their
arrival
the
siren
call
had
ceased
but
there
had
been
no
lessening
of
speed
by
the
racing
dugouts
on
the
contrary
the
last
long
mile
had
been
covered
in
a
final
desperate
spurt
the
paddles
swinging
in
swift
unison
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
ferocious
chant
of
one
syllable
hough
hough
hough
this
explosive
cadence
had
echoed
down
the
stream
ahead
of
them
and
now
as
the
panting
crews
emerged
from
the
jungle
they
found
themselves
flanked
by
a
long
line
of
their
bristling
with
drawn
arrows
and
ready
spear
points
but
of
the
enemy
whose
presence
that
great
xylophone
had
betokened
there
was
no
sign
at
sight
of
the
familiar
feather
bonnets
of
their
own
men
the
tense
monitayans
let
their
weapons
slowly
sink
and
when
tucu
leaping
ashore
gaspingly
demanded
news
of
the
fight
the
line
dissolved
into
a
mob
which
rushed
to
welcome
him
and
his
mates
in
the
first
few
breaths
it
was
learned
that
no
fight
had
yet
taken
place
but
that
all
the
warriors
had
been
brought
in
and
ordered
to
prepare
to
march
at
the
next
sunrise
and
that
the
sudden
war
call
had
been
sent
out
as
the
result
of
the
arrival
of
a
stranger
then
the
crowd
parted
and
through
it
came
striding
two
men
whose
appearance
caused
the
white
men
to
erupt
into
hoarse
shouts
of
greeting
one
whose
hard
face
swiftly
relaxed
into
a
half
smile
of
relief
was
the
great
chief
himself
the
other
whose
jutting
jaw
suddenly
dropped
and
whose
blue
eyes
opened
in
incredulity
was
tim
tim
once
more
strong
and
florid
and
aggressive
gripping
his
rifle
astounded
at
the
sight
of
his
comrades
standing
there
alive
and
alert
they
soon
learned
why
dropping
his
gun
he
sprang
at
them
with
an
inarticulate
roar
of
welcome
he
wrung
their
hands
pounded
their
shoulders
laughed
cried
swore
all
at
once
then
he
burst
out
glory
be
ye
alive
homelier
ever
and
tough
as
tripe
we
thought
ye
was
wiped

the
raposa
these
girls

mayoruna
women
held

by
the
red
bones
we
got
them
last
night
and
lit
out
in
the
middle
of
a
general
engagement
now
open
up
with
your
news
right
cap
we
got
a
visitor
old
friend
of
ourn
old
hozy
the
only
white
guy
in
that
peruvian
crew
we
had
he
all
dolled
up
like
an
injun

and
so

the
injun
country
that
way
i
dunno
yet
how
he
done
it

bein
a
peruvian
and

but
he
got
through
and
he
says

a
whole
gang
of
bad

thing
i
was
here
when
he
come
or
he
be
cut
up
and
in
the
stewpot
monitaya
a
good
skate
but
he
sure
is
poison
to
anything
peruvian
and
soon
as
hozy
begun
to
try
to
talk
he
got
wise
and
dang
near
bumped
him
off
i
got
him
to
cool
down
some
and
he
believes
tellin
the
truth
but
even
at
that
they
got
hozy
tied
up
like
a
dog
come
look
at
him
but
it
was
necessary
to
wait
awhile
for
tucu
and
lourenço
to
tell
monitaya
the
tale
of
what
had
taken
place
for
the
chief
demanded
immediate
and
full
details
and
not
until
he
had
them
would
he
return
to
his
and
his
hammock
throne
by
that
time
the
little
moon
was
again
ruler
of
the
sky
and
the
keen
hunger
of
the
voyagers
had
grown
ravenous
followed
by
the
rescued
and
the
rescuers
he
then
stalked
into
the
tribal
house
and
to
his
usual
place
where
he
commanded
that
food
be
brought
on
the
ground
directly
in
front
of
the
chief
hammock
sat
a
gaunt
painted
indian
around
whose
neck
was
a
stout
noose
the
other
end
of
the
cord
being
held
by
a
muscular
savage
whose
club
was
gripped
loosely
in
his
other
fist
as
the
whites
reached
them
the
noosed
man
face
cracked
in
a
grin
greetings
señores
said
the
voice
of
josé
you
will
pardon
me
for
remaining
seated
yes
the
man
behind
me
is
itching
for
an
excuse
to
crush
my
head
josé
exclaimed
both
knowlton
and
mckay
though
tim
had
said
josé
was
tied
like
a
dog
they
had
not
thought
to
find
the
expression
literal
truth
the
sight
angered
them
and
they
turned
to
lourenço
tell
monitaya
we
want
this
man
freed
mckay
snapped
at
his
peremptory
tone
the
cannibal
chieftain
looked
oddly
at
him
and
when
lourenço
translated
the
demand
though
in
a
more
diplomatic
manner
he
scowled
but
he
gave
the
clubman
the
word
and
the
rope
was
lifted
from
the
prisoner
neck
he
bowed
if
i
still
remain
seated
it
is
because
i
am
very
weary
and
i
have
not
eaten
since
yesterday
his
thin
face
and
his
projecting
ribs
not
only
corroborated
his
simple
announcement
but
indicated
that
for
more
than
one
day
his
food
and
rest
had
been
almost
naked
painted
minus
his
fierce
mustache
and
flamboyant
headkerchief
he
appeared
a
far
different
man
than
the
domineering
of
a
short
time
back
but
his
bold
black
eyes
his
reckless
grin
and
his
mocking
tone
proved
him
the
same
swashbuckling
josé
undaunted
by
hunger
exhaustion
or
his
position
as
prisoner
of
man
eaters
whose
enmity
was
implacable
well
you
going
to
eat
now
or
we
know
why
not
vowed
knowlton
we
understand
that
you
brought
a
warning
to
monitaya
is
this
his
way
of
treating
men
who
risk
their
lives
to
befriend
him
josé
shrugged
once
an
enemy
always
an
enemy
that
is
their
rule
and
do
not
think
that
i
traveled
the
bush
and
threw
myself
into
this
snake
heap
from
love
of
monitaya
i
do
not
care
if
he
and
all
his
race
are
blown
to
hell
i
am
here
because
as
i
once
told
you
josé
martinez
never
forgets
thank
you
señor
i
will
eat
now
and
talk
later
deftly
he
extracted
a
chunk
of
meat
from
a
clay
pot
which
had
been
placed
before
knowlton
and
in
turn
tendered
to
him
monitaya
watched
him
eat
but
gave
no
sign
of
disapproval
and
the
americans
and
even
the
brazilians
made
an
aggressive
show
of
friendship
toward
the
lone
peruvian
for
the
express
benefit
of
the
chief
they
knew
well
that
by
their
rescue
of
the
mayoruna
women
they
had
made
their
own
position
among
these
people
virtually
impregnable
and
that
their
recognition
of
josé
as
a
friend
probably
would
be
his
only
bulwark
wherefore
they
left
no
doubt
in
the
minds
of
the
watchers
as
to
where
he
stood
in
their
regard
monitaya
sitting
in
regal
dignity
looked
down
upon
two
parties
of
seven
feasting
with
famished
speed
the
rescued
women
who
were
not
members
of
his
own
tribe
and
the
four
americans
two
brazilians
and
one
peruvian
all
the
others
had
scattered
tucu
and
his
band
to
their
own
family
triangles
and
the
four
monitaya
girls
to
become
the
nuclei
of
feminine
groups
which
demanded
intimate
accounts
of
their
capture
and
treatment
by
the
captors
to
the
strange
women
at
his
feet
the
chief
paid
scant
attention
now
though
he
meant
to
interrogate
them
after
their
hunger
was
satisfied
his
eyes
dwelt
on
rand
the
strange
combination
of
white
man
indian
and
jungle
demon
of
whom
he
had
heard
so
much
and
on
whose
tanned
skin
the
red
skeleton
streaks
told
the
tale
of
a
mind
out
of
the
skull
josé
and
tim
stared
in
frank
curiosity
at
the
newcomer
whose
silent
composure
remained
totally
unperturbed
but
the
seven
new
girls
though
ignored
by
the
chief
and
his
guests
were
by
no
means
neglected
by
the
other
men
of
the
being
thoroughly
stared
at
by
most
of
the
young
bucks
and
it
must
be
confessed
by
a
goodly
proportion
of
the
married
men
also
when
at
length
the
meal
was
finished
monitaya
commanded
the
girls
to
stand
before
him
and
narrate
their
experiences
the
men
lit
smokes
josé
seizing
the
proffered
cigarette
with
avidity
rand
accepting
his
with
the
usual
odd
deliberation
wal
hozy
old
feller
ye
in
right
with
the
chief
now
asserted
tim
ye
got
all
our
gang
with
ye
and
she
some
old
gang
tell
the
world
this
feller
renzo
can
talk
cannibal
so
good
he
makes
monitaya
hunt
for
the
dictionary
and
he
tell
the
chief
in
ten
seconds
what
i
tried
half
an
hour
to
say
this
afternoon
that
ye
belong
i
been
here
long
enough
to
learn
much
o
their
lingo
ye
understand
if
i
could
spout
it
like
french
now
there
would
been
no
trouble
mckay
and
knowlton
snickered
they
knew
tim
french
was
several
degrees
worse
than
the
usual
american
doughboy
frog
talk
good
thing
you
could
derided
knowlton
you
have
had
josé
crucified
before
we
got
here
that
right
gim
me
the
razz
course
i
did
have
a
trouble
some
o
them
frogs
understand
but
that
was
because
they
was
so
ignorant
they
did
know
their
own
language
when
they
heard
it
spoke
right
anyways
ye
got
to
admit
hozy
still
with
us
and
sassy
as
ever
and
he
would
been
if
timmy
ryan
had
been
round
to
powwow
for
him
you
have
it
right
señor
josé
agreed
gravely
without
you
i
should
now
be
dead
i
can
speak
the
mayoruna
tongue
quite
well
but
of
what
use
is
it
to
talk
any
language
when
men
will
not
listen
it
was
you
and
your
gun
that
saved
me
gun
good
lord
did
you
pull
a
gun
on
monitaya
ejaculated
the
lieutenant
aw
no
that
is
i
guess
mebbe
i
did
wave
me
piece
around
while
i
was
arguin
i
can
always
convince
a
guy
better
if
i
got
somethin
in
me
hand
but
i
did
git
real
rough
you
are
lucky
to
be
still
alive
senhor
tim
said
lourenço
if
monitaya
were
not
the
man
he
is
you
would
not
be
alive
i
am
glad
we
have
returned
meanin
i
need
a
guardeen
say
lookit
here
now
as
you
were
clipped
mckay
we
all
wasting
time
josé
let
hear
your
report
i
thought
you
were
going
to
put
schwandorf
out
of
action
for
good
and
i
am
capitan
that
is
why
i
now
am
here
if
i
had
reached
him
immediately
after
leaving
the
nunes
place
it
would
have
been
done
at
once
but
a
man
travels
slowly
when
he
is
alone
and
has
lost
much
blood
and
before
i
met
schwandorf
again
i
had
time
to
think
coolly
then
when
i
saw
him
i
changed
my
plans
some
days
down
the
river
i
met
him
traveling
fast
in
a
canoe
paddled
by
hard
men
whom
i
know
he
pretended
to
be
greatly
grieved
when
i
told
him
you
all
were
dead
oh
yes
señores
i
told
him
that
i
was
playing
with
him
and
it
amused
me
to
see
how
he
thought
he
was
deceiving
me
when
i
was
really
fooling
him
i
said
we
were
attacked
by
indians
a
short
way
above
the
nunes
place
and
that
i
alone
escaped
then
he
said
something
that
made
me
decide
not
to
kill
him
for
a
time
he
told
me
he
had
learned
that
this
man
here
his
name
is
rand
yes
that
the
man
rand
was
a
bank
thief
who
had
run
away
from
north
america
and
that
a
reward
would
be
paid
for
him
he
said
your
real
reason
for
coming
here
was
that
you
were
detectives
trying
to
earn
the
reward
that
is
false
is
it
not
señores
we
no
detectives
rand
no
thief
ah
so
i
thought
but
schwandorf
often
tells
truth
to
conceal
his
lies
so
that
it
is
sometimes
hard
to
know
which
is
true
and
which
untrue
he
went
on
to
say
he
had
warned
you
not
to
come
into
this
indian
country
and
he
was
sorry
you
had
been
killed
the
snake
but
since
you
were
dead
we
might
get
the
money
for
ourselves
if
we
succeeded
in
catching
the
man
rand
and
taking
him
out
alive
i
should
get
half
the
reward
or
five
hundred
dollars
i
saw
plainly
what
his
plan
was
i
might
be
useful
to
him
in
catching
rand
if
rand
was
out
in
the
bush
for
i
have
traveled
this
country
alone
more
than
once
and
am
a
far
better
bushman
than
the
german
but
whether
i
got
rand
or
not
i
never
should
live
to
demand
my
part
of
the
money
i
know
too
much
about
schwandorf
things
which
i
shall
not
tell
now
so
when
the
right
time
should
come
josé
would
meet
with
a
fatal
accident
such
as
a
bullet
in
the
back
or
a
knife
in
the
throat
while
sleeping
but
i
did
not
let
him
know
i
saw
this
i
pretended
to
fall
in
with
his
plan
like
the
fool
he
thought
me
to
be
it
was
not
rand
alone
that
brought
him
here
you
have
brought
back
mayoruna
women
from
the
red
bone
country
so
you
know
the
red
bones
are
women
stealers
and
they
steal
for
schwandorf
you
may
believe
me
or
not
señores
but
i
did
not
know
this
until
the
german
told
me
oh
yes
i
knew
he
dealt
in
women
but
of
the
red
bone
part
of
his
business
i
was
ignorant
as
soon
as
i
learned
it
i
saw
how
i
could
put
the
illustrious
señor
schwandorf
out
of
action
as
you
say
and
at
the
same
time
try
to
save
you
i
sharpened
my
knife
to
a
razor
edge
deserted
the
german
when
we
reached
the
right
place
shaved
with
my
knife
painted
myself
with
the
red
and
black
plant
dyes
and
came
overland
to
this
place
thinking
you
would
be
here
if
still
alive
but
you
had
traveled
faster
than
i
expected
and
had
gone
into
the
red
bone
country
so
my
chance
to
save
you
seemed
to
have
passed
i
could
only
try
to
tell
this
chief
the
red
bones
were
stealers
of
his
women
and
that
the
german
was
with
them
knowing
that
if
he
believed
me
he
would
go
on
the
war
trail
against
them
and
kill
them
all
but
if
señor
tim
had
not
befriended
me
i
should
have
died
too
soon
to
tell
my
tale
that
is
all
señores
now
can
you
spare
a
little
more
tobacco
they
could
and
they
promptly
did
with
a
new
cigarette
glowing
he
lay
back
and
looked
quizzically
at
the
women
lined
up
before
monitaya
how
many
men
has
schwandorf
asked
mckay
about
twenty
in
all
capitan
there
were
eight
in
his
crew
and
they
were
to
meet
a
dozen
more
at
a
place
on
the
peruvian
side
all
riflemen
he
brought
many
cartridges
for
them
they
are
to
raid
tribe
houses
of
these
people
capture
women
and
run
them
into
peru
josé
yawned
as
if
speaking
of
a
deal
in
salt
fish
the
americans
looked
thoughtfully
around
the
big
house
they
saw
that
every
man
near
them
was
inspecting
some
kind
of
weapon
making
sure
that
bow
cords
were
unfrayed
that
arrow
heads
and
spear
points
were
firm
that
the
long
blowguns
had
received
no
cast
from
suspension
and
that
darts
were
absolutely
straight
and
true
the
strong
but
cruel
faces
of
the
warriors
were
stamped
with
malignant
hatred
of
the
red
bone
tribe
and
the
blackbeard
who
enslaved
their
women
the
command
to
prepare
for
a
march
at
dawn
had
not
been
withdrawn
we
be
expected
to
go
too
and
i
sure
like
another
crack
at
umanuh
not
to
mention
the
schwandorf
outfit
said
knowlton
but
we
have
friend
rand
on
our
hands
now
and
our
first
duty
is
to
get
him
out
of
here
safely
aw
looey
have
a
heart
i
had
no
action
since
that
scrap
down
the
river
and
i
got
to
have
some
excitement
before
we
blow
more
we
ca
beat
it
now
with
monitaya
dependin
on
us
to
fight
on
his
side
he
git
sore
and
i
do
blame
him
his
superior
officers
and
the
brazilians
frowned
every
man
of
them
itched
to
close
with
the
enemy
in
one
final
decisive
battle
yet
what
we
do
with
rand
knowlton
voiced
the
general
thought
the
green
eyes
of
the
raposa
turned
to
him
rested
long
on
his
traveled
deliberately
along
the
other
faces
and
then
to
the
utter
astonishment
of
all
the
dumb
spoke
i
fight
said
rand
speechless
the
men
around
him
stared
his
face
was
inscrutable
as
ever
his
eyes
fathomless
his
voice
flat
and
toneless
but
slowly
he
raised
his
hands
as
if
holding
a
bow
twitched
his
right
thumb
and
forefinger
in
the
motion
of
loosing
a
shaft
let
the
hands
sink
his
gaze
calmly
lifted
from
theirs
and
dwelt
on
the
farthest
wall
not
another
word
did
he
speak
begorry
there
yer
answer
triumphed
tim
he
says
and
i
bet
he
can
sling
a
wicked
bow
and
arrer
at
that
do
ye
he
wants
a
crack
at
them
red
bones
after
the
way
they
used
him
i
think
comrades
that
the
man
has
settled
the
matter
for
us
pedro
seconded
none
of
us
wants
to
run
away
and
as
tim
says
we
are
expected
to
help
monitaya
we
should
be
considered
cowards
worse
than
dogs
if
we
refused
if
we
do
not
fight
the
red
bones
we
may
have
to
fight
these
mayorunas
who
now
are
our
friends
we
must
stay
mckay
nodded
still
studying
the
expressionless
countenance
of
rand
that
settled
he
announced
crisply
now
lourenço
find
out
monitaya
plan
of
battle
the
chief
had
finished
his
examination
of
the
women
and
lourenço
promptly
put
the
question
monitaya
laconically
replied
his
purpose
is
not
changed
by
our
arrival
capitao
he
and
his
men
go
to
attack
and
destroy
the
red
bones
when
they
reach
the
town
of
umanuh
they
will
surround
it
and
all
will
rush
in
when
the
chief
gives
his
yell
of
war
about
what
i
expected
an
indian
has
a
mind
always
but
his
strategy
is
rotten
might
be
good
enough
if
he
had
only
umanuh
to
deal
with
but
with
schwandorf
in
the
game
it
different
ask
him
how
he
expects
to
protect
his
women
while
he
gone
he
says
lourenço
reported
that
there
will
be
no
danger
to
the
women
because
his
warriors
will
be
between
the
women
and
their
enemies
until
those
enemies
are
dead
very
simple
so
simple
that
it
foolish
he
does
figure
on
the
other
fellow
mind
at
all
does
realize
that
a
man
like
schwandorf
is
bound
to
outguess
him
on
such
straightaway
tactics
and
is
at
all
likely
to
play
into
his
hands
but
that
the
exact
situation
the
german
will
outguess
him
and
it
up
to
him
to
outguess
the
german
in
turn
we
do
his
guessing
for
him
schwandorf
goes
into
umanuh
town
learns
what
happened
finds
the
red
bones
frothing
at
the
mouth
and
is
sore
himself
he
figures
that
we
returned
here
with
the
women
that
monitaya
men
are
against
the
red
bones
and
that
they
do
just
what
they
are
planning
to
do
march
on
red
bone
town
and
leave
their
women
unprotected
except
by
the
old
men
whose
defensive
power
is
negligible
he
is
in
this
country
for
the
express
purpose
of
getting
girls
and
with
men
away
from
their
he
has
a
chance
to
make
the
biggest
slave
haul
of
his
life
so
he
plans
to
outmaneuver
monitaya
attack
this
place
capture
all
the
young
women
allow
the
red
bones
to
massacre
everyone
else
and
burn
the
houses
and
then
move
on
without
the
loss
of
a
man
after
that
perhaps
he
intends
to
find
us
and
get
rand
or
perhaps
to
attack
other
mayoruna
at
any
rate
his
first
objective
is
this
place
am
i
right
so
far
dead
right
knowlton
nodded
very
well
now
he
may
figure
that
having
found
the
water
connection
between
the
two
creeks
the
mayorunas
will
come
against
umanuh
by
the
canoe
route
or
he
may
think
they
make
the
overland
trip
in
either
case
the
red
bones
have
to
come
through
the
bush
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
have
boats
enough
to
carry
all
their
force
their
canoes
were
rather
few
when
we
were
there
and
we
commandeered
several
of
them
for
our
own
use
if
they
decide
to
come
part
of
the
way
in
canoes
they
have
to
work
a
transport
service
bringing
the
fighting
men
down
in
batches
to
some
rendezvous
from
which
they
must
finish
the
journey
on
foot
chances
are
that
they
disregard
the
canoes
and
all
march
overland
by
some
route
that
would
dodge
the
mayoruna
line
of
march
but
in
either
case
they
coming
here
and
here
in
the
place
where
he
not
expected
to
be
that
monitaya
should
meet
them
let
him
fortify
himself
and
await
the
assault
it
will
come
and
we
shall
be
saved
many
weary
miles
of
leg
work
josé
smiled
capitan
your
strategy
is
magnificent
begorry
it
ai
so
bad
at
that
tim
approved
hozy
me
and
you
will
have
our
hammicks
slung
out
front
here
when
the
show
starts
and
do
our
shootin
prone
suits
me
fine
put
it
up
to
the
chief
renzo
lourenço
did
very
carefully
he
explained
it
all
to
monitaya
dwelling
on
the
fact
that
mckay
himself
was
a
warrior
chieftain
and
familiar
with
the
fighting
methods
of
such
men
as
the
atrocious
blackbeard
and
depicting
graphically
the
horror
of
an
attack
by
the
barbarous
red
bones
on
the
defenseless
women
it
took
him
some
time
to
divert
the
stubborn
mind
from
the
original
plan
but
in
the
end
he
succeeded
to
the
vast
astonishment
and
disappointment
of
the
vengeful
warriors
monitaya
curtly
announced
that
the
projected
march
would
not
take
place
they
stared
as
if
disbelieving
their
ears
and
more
than
one
black
look
was
given
lourenço
but
not
a
man
questioned
the
countermanding
of
orders
not
a
mutter
was
heard
the
great
chief
had
spoken
and
his
word
was
final
reluctantly
they
laid
aside
the
weapons
on
which
they
had
been
toiling
with
such
purposeful
zeal
the
chief
watched
them
with
a
little
smile
of
pride
pride
in
their
zest
for
war
pride
in
their
unquestioning
acceptance
of
his
dampening
order
then
he
coolly
told
them
to
continue
their
work
told
them
further
that
the
next
morning
all
the
streams
were
to
be
poisoned
new
traps
set
and
scouts
stationed
far
out
on
every
trail
to
await
and
report
the
approach
of
foes
instantly
their
faces
flamed
again
and
from
every
quarter
of
the
wide
house
rose
an
excited
hum
they
were
to
fight
after
all
tough
eggs
these
lads
if
ye
ask
me
yawned
tim
bet
ye
we
see
a
row
worth
lookin
at
when
she
does
break
he
forebore
to
mention
the
fact
that
in
rifle
power
their
assailants
would
outnumber
them
four
to
one
chapter
xxiv
the
battle
of
the
tribes
the
next
four
days
though
they
were
days
of
waiting
were
busy
enough
to
satisfy
the
most
impatient
mayoruna
warrior
outposts
were
established
on
every
route
by
which
the
attacking
force
would
be
likely
to
approach
the
twin
the
watchmen
being
given
the
strictest
commands
not
to
fight
nor
even
to
allow
themselves
to
be
seen
but
to
run
at
top
speed
with
the
warning
poison
detachments
went
forth
to
collect
the
ingredients
for
making
deadly
the
water
and
the
weapons
those
detailed
to
the
work
of
polluting
the
streams
gathered
quantities
of
plants
with
yellow
roots
the
roots
being
pulped
and
thrown
into
the
slow
currents
which
straightway
became
fatal
to
man
or
beast
the
wurali
squad
procured
their
favorite
materials
and
in
a
flimsy
shed
well
away
from
the
houses
prepared
a
plentiful
supply
of
the
venomed
brew
new
traps
were
set
at
points
where
a
man
or
two
might
be
picked
off
though
it
was
realized
that
these
would
have
little
effect
on
the
final
result
and
inside
the
big
houses
men
especially
skilled
in
the
manufacture
of
arrows
and
darts
toiled
swiftly
and
steadily
from
dawn
till
far
into
the
night
these
activities
however
were
only
the
usual
defensive
preparations
made
by
the
warriors
whenever
they
knew
a
sizable
body
of
foes
was
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
it
remained
for
the
brains
of
the
white
men
to
devise
additional
features
simple
enough
in
themselves
but
astounding
to
the
savages
who
were
accustomed
only
to
the
primitive
battle
tactics
of
their
ancestors
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
the
cannibals
found
themselves
digging
in
and
also
digging
out
after
a
survey
of
the
terrain
and
a
catechism
of
lourenço
and
monitaya
as
to
the
usual
methods
of
attack
and
defense
the
two
officers
broached
an
idea
born
of
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
as
they
expected
the
great
chief
was
somewhat
slow
to
approve
it
for
it
involved
a
literal
undermining
of
the
walls
of
his
fortresses
but
despite
the
natural
inflexibility
of
his
mental
processes
he
was
an
unusually
intelligent
savage
and
eventually
the
patient
reiteration
of
the
advantages
of
the
scheme
won
him
first
to
assent
and
then
almost
to
enthusiasm
wherefore
the
amazed
tribesmen
were
set
to
work
armed
with
crude
wooden
shovels
in
digging
holes
under
the
logs
which
sheltered
them
from
man
beast
and
jungle
demon
all
along
the
walls
at
intervals
marked
by
mckay
and
knowlton
the
tunnels
were
dug
at
the
same
time
another
large
gang
excavated
before
each
of
the
a
deep
curving
trench
the
two
long
pits
being
separated
by
a
space
of
solid
earth
affording
free
passage
from
the
houses
to
the
creek
meanwhile
the
women
and
the
older
children
were
weaving
flimsy
covers
from
withes
and
vines
as
soon
as
a
tunnel
was
completed
it
was
masked
outside
the
walls
by
one
of
these
covers
on
which
a
thin
layer
of
earth
and
grass
was
laid
the
two
trenches
were
likewise
concealed
and
the
loose
earth
was
carried
inside
the
house
and
packed
solidly
against
the
walls
flanking
the
doors
at
sundown
of
the
fourth
day
the
work
was
ended
and
so
well
was
it
done
that
when
the
great
chief
his
subchiefs
and
his
foreign
allies
went
on
a
final
tour
of
inspection
they
could
find
no
sign
that
the
houses
were
honeycombed
with
exits
or
that
the
ground
in
front
of
the
little
entrances
was
not
solid
at
all
points
rod
and
i
took
the
idea
from
those
pit
traps
out
on
the
trails
knowlton
explained
for
the
dozenth
time
holes
are
covered
to
look
exactly
like
the
rest
of
the
ground
every
man
of
us
has
to
be
inside
when
the
enemy
arrives
but
we
have
to
get
out
quick
when
the
right
time
comes
so
we
go
under
the
walls
and
ca
you
see
those
brave
women
stealers
go
kerplunk
down
into
the
trenches
oh
boy
whereat
lourenço
and
josé
smiled
as
if
enjoying
a
secret
joke
they
were
for
they
knew
something
of
which
the
americans
were
not
aware
that
monitaya
had
improved
on
the
idea
of
the
whites
by
studding
the
bottom
of
those
trenches
with
barbed
araya
bones
smeared
with
wurali
yeah
and
i
figger
them
guys
git
some
jolt
when
these
houses
which
got
nobody
in
but
women
and
kids
begin
to
spit
lead
out
loopholes
and
spew
screechin
cannibals
up
out
o
the
ground
gosh
i
would
miss
seein
face
for
a
keg
o
beer
and
sayin
somethin
wherein
tim
expressed
the
general
sentiment
so
ended
the
fourth
day
when
the
fifth
broke
no
man
showed
himself
outside
the
walls
except
the
few
outposts
every
male
of
the
monitaya
bided
within
awaiting
with
growing
tension
the
arrival
of
the
enemy
it
was
more
than
likely
mckay
had
pointed
out
that
the
main
body
of
the
barbarous
force
led
by
schwandorf
would
be
preceded
by
a
handful
of
scouts
and
quite
possible
that
one
or
more
of
these
would
slip
past
the
outguards
and
spy
on
the
tribal
houses
the
sight
of
even
one
warrior
would
instantly
apprise
any
such
spy
that
the
others
must
be
near
and
the
word
would
go
back
at
all
speed
to
the
red
bones
wherefore
the
only
monitayans
to
pass
through
the
tiny
doorways
that
morning
were
a
few
young
women
sent
out
as
bait
these
naturally
took
good
care
to
stay
near
the
entrances
within
the
men
waited
at
their
appointed
places
each
tunnel
had
its
quota
of
warriors
the
number
being
divided
evenly
to
assure
a
speedy
and
simultaneous
exit
the
americans
had
elected
to
fight
from
the
of
the
great
chief
while
the
brazilians
and
josé
were
to
garrison
the
doorway
of
the
other
house
as
soon
as
the
warning
came
rand
wordless
and
imperturbable
as
ever
now
was
armed
with
a
strong
bow
and
plenty
of
new
arrows
with
unpoisoned
heads
and
he
of
course
would
remain
with
his
own
countrymen
thus
preparations
completed
all
settled
themselves
to
the
interminable
hours
of
waiting
up
on
the
heaped
earth
near
the
doorway
which
made
the
walls
practically
to
a
height
of
six
feet
and
thus
would
protect
the
women
and
children
one
or
more
of
the
americans
was
constantly
on
the
lookout
through
some
inconspicuous
loophole
hour
after
hour
dragged
past
and
no
unusual
movement
or
sound
came
to
reward
their
vigilance
under
the
glare
of
the
sun
the
roof
and
walls
grew
hot
under
the
silent
strain
of
endless
anticipation
the
impatience
of
the
fighting
men
became
a
ferment
at
length
pedro
unable
to
keep
still
mounted
to
a
peephole
near
knowlton
scarcely
had
he
put
his
eye
to
the
opening
when
both
men
sucked
in
their
breath
at
the
edge
of
the
bush
a
man
head
peered
from
behind
a
tree
and
at
the
same
moment
a
single
canoe
came
creeping
out
of
the
bush
and
up
to
the
landing
place
the
head
behind
the
tree
was
that
of
a
red
bone
spy
the
two
in
the
small
canoe
were
yuara
and
a
companion
from
the
suba
tribe
lourenço
hoarsely
whispered
pedro
yuara
comes
tell
girls
to
run
to
welcome
him
and
guide
him
between
the
pits
a
spy
is
watching
if
yuara
walks
on
the
pits
he
dies
and
our
trap
is
revealed
amor
de
send
girls
quickly
lourenço
acted
instantly
seizing
two
young
women
he
propelled
them
doorward
talking
swiftly
the
while
yuara
and
his
mate
were
already
advancing
innocently
toward
the
few
girls
outside
none
of
whom
had
wit
enough
to
warn
him
but
the
two
whom
the
brazilian
had
grasped
happened
to
be
of
quick
intelligence
and
now
they
darted
out
before
the
visiting
pair
could
reach
the
death
trap
the
girls
were
upon
them
laughing
as
if
delighted
to
see
a
man
once
more
and
deftly
turning
them
aside
to
the
point
where
two
unobtrusive
stubs
marked
the
bridge
of
safety
vastly
astonished
by
such
effusive
welcome
from
two
girls
whom
they
did
not
know
but
by
no
means
displeased
thereby
the
young
warriors
of
the
suba
clan
were
piloted
to
the
door
and
inside
as
they
disappeared
the
head
of
the
spy
also
vanished
woof
muttered
knowlton
wiping
sweat
from
his
brow
that
was
close
here
hoping
we
have
no
more
visitors
yuara
and
his
companion
meanwhile
were
being
interrogated
by
both
lourenço
and
monitaya
who
in
turn
enlightened
them
as
to
the
present
state
of
affairs
at
the
promise
of
war
the
faces
of
the
suba
men
lit
up
yuara
comes
only
on
a
visit
to
learn
news
lourenço
told
the
rest
you
remember
that
the
day
after
our
return
a
canoe
was
sent
downstream
to
a
point
where
the
wooden
bars
could
be
beaten
and
heard
by
men
and
that
a
warning
against
the
red
bones
and
schwandorf
was
given
in
that
way
yuara
has
become
anxious
to
know
more
so
he
is
here
if
he
sticks
around
he
learn
a
lot
predicted
tim
with
no
waste
of
words
or
motion
yuara
coolly
attached
himself
and
his
to
mckay
monitaya
and
his
subchiefs
were
informed
of
the
arrival
and
departure
of
the
enemy
scout
the
word
passed
among
the
warriors
who
despite
their
innate
equanimity
began
to
grit
their
pointed
teeth
and
quiver
like
dogs
held
in
leash
but
another
hour
passed
and
yet
another
and
still
no
word
from
the
outposts
arrived
suddenly
a
chorus
of
screams
shrilled
from
the
women
outside
in
a
frenzy
of
fear
they
plunged
through
the
doorways
blending
with
their
outcries
a
hoarse
yell
of
ferocity
rose
raucously
from
the
direction
of
the
creek
at
once
a
louder
ululation
burst
forth
at
the
rear
and
sides
of
the
clearing
monitaya
outguards
had
failed
and
the
were
surrounded
loping
from
the
bush
fringing
the
stream
came
a
score
of
shirtless
barefooted
brutes
crisscrossed
with
cartridge
belts
and
gripping
rifles
at
their
head
loomed
a
burly
creature
with
a
revolver
in
each
hand
the
malignant
schwandorf
himself
grinning
like
a
pack
of
wolves
they
doubled
toward
the
low
entrances
their
guns
spouting
wantonly
at
the
upper
walls
a
ragged
volley
meant
to
terrorize
the
defenseless
women
within
none
of
whom
were
to
be
killed
until
the
handsomest
had
been
cut
out
and
set
aside
for
slavery
some
of
the
heavy
bullets
bored
through
between
logs
and
thudded
wickedly
into
rafters
and
roof
poles
within
but
from
the
loopholes
where
the
defending
rifles
lurked
no
shot
cracked
in
reply
the
fiendish
howling
of
the
red
bones
sweeping
in
from
all
sides
to
the
butchery
swelled
into
a
feline
screech
that
almost
drowned
the
roar
of
the
rifles
into
the
view
of
the
watchers
at
the
loopholes
streamed
hideous
faces
and
naked
brown
bodies
swerving
inward
from
left
and
right
to
follow
at
the
heels
of
the
blackbeard
and
his
gunmen
in
a
few
seconds
more
the
trotting
line
of
peruvians
was
backed
and
flanked
by
a
horde
of
demons
hungering
for
the
taste
of
women
and
babes
on
they
came
with
the
suddenness
of
a
cataclysm
the
ground
opened
riflemen
vanished
in
midstride
savages
screaming
triumphant
hate
were
gone
in
the
flick
of
an
eye
others
instinctively
digging
their
heels
into
the
ground
the
instant
those
ahead
of
them
disappeared
were
hurled
forward
and
down
by
the
momentum
of
the
following
mass
before
the
rush
could
be
checked
the
trenches
were
packed
with
men
struggling
in
frenzy
to
get
out
wounding
themselves
and
one
another
with
the
deadly
points
of
their
poisoned
weapons
of
the
twenty
gunmen
only
four
remained
they
were
the
four
immediately
behind
schwandorf
by
blind
chance
the
german
had
set
foot
on
the
narrow
isthmus
separating
the
twin
trenches
saving
himself
and
the
henchmen
at
his
heels
from
being
engulfed
now
as
the
red
bones
fought
back
from
the
trap
yawning
before
them
he
and
the
surviving
peruvians
stood
staring
in
momentary
stupefaction
at
the
welter
of
death
on
their
flanks
the
malevolent
yells
of
the
savages
had
been
cut
short
by
the
catastrophe
and
for
the
moment
no
sound
was
heard
but
the
grunts
and
snarls
of
struggling
men
then
into
the
semisilence
burst
a
mighty
voice
the
battlefield
voice
of
mckay
now
fire
at
will
the
walls
spat
flame
and
lead
a
scythe
of
death
swept
above
the
ground
where
stood
schwandorf
and
his
riflemen
the
peruvian
collapsed
and
lay
still
but
schwandorf
shocked
into
activity
by
the
impact
of
that
first
word
dodged
death
by
an
infinitesimal
fraction
of
a
second
hurling
himself
backward
he
struck
the
earth
just
as
the
bullets
sped
through
the
air
over
him
with
a
lightning
rebound
he
was
up
while
fresh
cartridges
were
jumping
into
the
rifle
barrels
menacing
him
headlong
he
dived
into
the
mass
of
red
bones
just
behind
and
the
next
bullets
darting
after
him
killed
the
savages
leaving
him
unharmed
the
command
of
mckay
and
the
crack
of
the
rifles
sent
the
quivering
mayorunas
into
the
fight
in
a
flash
every
masking
tunnel
cover
was
thrown
bodily
into
the
air
before
the
thunderstruck
red
bones
had
recovered
from
the
shock
of
finding
their
leaders
annihilated
and
their
mass
being
swept
by
rifles
hidden
in
the
walls
they
beheld
a
horde
of
vindictive
foes
erupting
from
under
those
walls
like
warrior
ants
rushing
from
subterranean
galleries
a
yell
of
concentrated
fury
smote
their
ears
a
hastily
loosed
storm
of
war
arrows
and
short
ripped
into
their
flesh
a
arc
of
men
swerved
around
them
shooting
and
stabbing
as
they
went
they
who
had
so
exultantly
surrounded
the
homes
of
women
and
children
now
were
surrounded
in
turn
from
the
doorway
of
monitaya
the
two
brazilians
and
josé
now
leaped
forth
and
firing
as
they
ran
dashed
to
hold
the
entrance
of
the
other
big
house
a
few
arrows
whirred
around
them
during
their
transit
but
the
shafts
were
shot
hurriedly
and
missed
meanwhile
the
three
bushmen
were
striking
down
enemies
at
every
flash
of
their
guns
firing
with
the
swift
surety
of
veterans
of
many
a
running
fight
they
reached
their
objective
unwounded
and
when
they
reached
it
a
fringe
of
dead
foes
marked
their
passage
along
the
face
of
the
hostile
array
once
within
the
door
they
rapidly
reloaded
and
sprayed
lead
along
the
trenches
which
though
now
nearly
full
had
become
a
past
which
no
red
bone
sought
to
go
up
on
the
earth
embankments
within
the
chief
house
the
four
americans
fought
steadily
on
the
soldiers
shooting
as
coolly
as
if
engaged
merely
in
target
practice
the
silent
rand
methodically
driving
arrows
in
swift
succession
from
his
arrows
thudded
thickly
into
the
logs
masking
them
bullets
too
slammed
into
their
rampart
bullets
from
the
heavy
revolvers
of
schwandorf
who
ever
keeping
himself
protected
by
the
bodies
of
his
cannibal
allies
shot
with
both
hands
as
the
chance
came
and
the
german
could
shoot
with
only
the
small
gun
muzzles
as
targets
he
planted
bullets
so
close
as
to
knock
dirt
more
than
once
into
the
eyes
of
the
riflemen
and
render
them
momentarily
useless
after
a
time
he
got
a
bullet
fair
into
a
loophole
knowlton
grunted
suddenly
swayed
back
toppled
fell
down
the
parapet
for
a
few
seconds
he
lay
still
looey
howled
tim
how
ye
fixed
hurt
bad
the
lieutenant
heaved
himself
into
a
sitting
position
stared
around
clapped
a
hand
to
his
right
shoulder
looked
at
the
red
smear
his
palm
brought
away
reeled
up
and
scrambled
back
to
his
rifle
bullet
had
drilled
clear
through
the
shoulder
and
in
falling
his
head
had
struck
one
of
the
upright
poles
without
a
word
he
got
his
gun
into
action
once
more
shooting
now
from
the
left
shoulder
tim
with
a
tight
grin
of
relief
devoted
himself
once
more
to
trying
to
shoot
down
the
dodging
german
the
encircling
mayorunas
their
first
paroxysm
of
fury
vented
now
settled
in
cold
hate
to
their
work
on
all
sides
their
clubmen
and
spearmen
were
bludgeoning
and
stabbing
at
the
red
bones
leaping
in
killing
springing
back
and
onward
with
terrible
efficiency
beyond
these
a
thin
but
deadly
line
of
bowmen
poured
arrows
in
curves
over
the
heads
of
the
combatants
the
shafts
whizzing
far
up
turning
and
plunging
down
unerringly
into
the
center
of
the
enemy
force
each
of
those
arrows
could
and
many
did
end
the
lives
of
two
or
three
adversaries
by
gouging
their
skins
and
letting
the
fearful
wurali
into
their
blood
the
blowgun
men
too
were
darting
into
every
opening
handling
their
clumsy
weapons
like
feathers
and
constantly
moving
to
spy
out
fresh
targets
but
the
men
of
monitaya
were
by
no
means
escaping
unscathed
the
red
bones
assailed
from
every
quarter
and
milling
about
in
hopeless
disorder
were
fighting
now
with
desperate
frenzy
their
own
clubbers
and
stabbers
were
charging
out
and
smashing
skulls
or
piercing
abdomens
their
arrows
rose
in
all
directions
at
once
and
some
into
whose
veins
the
wurali
had
struck
sprang
in
the
last
moments
of
life
on
nearby
foes
and
bit
like
mad
dogs
with
a
leader
and
a
chance
to
form
into
any
sort
of
flying
wedge
they
might
have
broken
through
with
comparative
ease
and
taken
a
far
heavier
toll
but
they
had
no
leader
for
umanuh
whose
name
meant
corpse
now
was
a
corpse
in
truth
his
merciless
brain
oozing
from
a
skull
shattered
by
a
mayoruna
clubman
and
schwandorf
was
very
busy
looking
out
for
schwandorf
so
it
was
every
man
for
himself
with
the
devil
rapidly
taking
not
only
the
hindmost
but
the
foremost
as
well
thicker
and
thicker
fell
the
dead
the
trenches
now
not
only
were
filled
to
the
level
of
the
ground
but
piled
with
a
windrow
of
bodies
knocked
down
by
the
rifles
josé
pedro
and
lourenço
abandoned
all
shelter
and
knelt
in
plain
sight
before
the
door
which
they
had
kept
clear
of
all
close
attack
monitaya
until
now
a
field
general
who
strode
up
and
down
roaring
commands
and
encouragement
suddenly
cast
away
his
regal
role
and
seizing
a
club
from
one
of
his
bodyguard
hurled
himself
on
the
nearest
red
bones
a
raving
ravening
demon
of
destructiveness
whose
glaring
eyes
smote
terror
into
those
fronting
him
and
whose
weapon
swung
like
the
club
of
hercules
his
bowmen
and
blowgun
men
at
last
out
of
missiles
came
charging
in
with
bare
hands
or
weapons
seized
from
fallen
warriors
maneuvering
had
ended
henceforth
the
fight
was
a
grappling
mêlée
then
the
gunfire
dwindled
and
died
the
rifle
cartridges
were
spent
chapter
xxv
the
passing
of
schwandorf
the
three
soldiers
flung
down
their
hot
empty
guns
nothin
left
but
the
gats
and
the
steel
rumbled
tim
me
i
out
and
git
some
fresh
air
with
which
he
drew
pistol
and
machete
leaped
down
and
lunged
through
the
door
mckay
bounded
at
his
heels
merry
rand
stay
here
he
commanded
then
he
was
outside
his
pistol
roaring
in
unison
with
tim
knowlton
and
rand
looked
at
each
other
the
lieutenant
fumbled
his
pistol
from
its
holster
got
it
firmly
in
his
left
hand
slid
down
the
embankment
and
staggered
out
rand
coolly
walked
over
to
discarded
gun
picked
it
up
and
followed
over
at
the
other
doorway
the
bushmen
threw
aside
their
useless
guns
and
drew
their
machetes
josé
grinning
like
a
whirled
the
bush
knife
aloft
and
mockingly
dared
the
red
bones
still
fronting
him
to
come
and
take
it
from
him
pedro
and
lourenço
indulged
in
no
such
bravado
but
leaped
like
jaguars
at
their
foes
whereupon
josé
muttering
a
curse
on
them
for
getting
the
jump
on
him
dashed
forward
with
furious
abandon
their
pistols
emptied
the
americans
also
drew
machetes
all
except
rand
who
had
no
weapon
but
the
bulletless
rifle
and
waited
few
unwounded
red
bones
now
were
left
but
among
those
few
schwandorf
still
lived
schwandorf
bellowed
mckay
you
yellow
cur
you
come
and
fight
yeah
taunted
tim
the
women
and
kids
are
inside
come
and
git
schwandorf
came
he
came
not
because
he
wanted
to
however
for
his
guns
too
were
empty
he
came
because
the
red
bones
sensing
the
challenge
and
loathing
the
blackbeard
who
had
shielded
himself
so
long
among
them
threw
him
out
bodily
they
had
no
time
to
stand
and
watch
what
might
happen
to
him
but
they
took
time
to
cast
him
out
where
he
must
stand
on
his
own
legs
then
snarling
they
resumed
their
now
hopeless
battle
against
their
encompassing
executioners
for
a
moment
the
german
stood
glowering
at
mckay
then
with
a
dramatic
gesture
he
threw
aside
his
useless
revolvers
and
advanced
empty
handed
man
to
man
he
growled
man
to
man
echoed
mckay
passing
his
pistol
to
tim
and
sheathing
his
machete
fists
clenched
he
sprang
forward
schwandorf
halted
his
hands
remained
empty
until
the
captain
was
within
eight
feet
of
him
then
he
leaped
back
his
machete
jumped
into
his
fist
and
its
point
stabbed
for
his
antagonist
abdomen
an
instantaneous
and
twist
of
the
body
saved
the
captain
from
evisceration
the
blade
ripped
through
breeches
and
shirt
and
scraped
the
skin
as
schwandorf
yanked
it
back
for
another
thrust
mckay
struck
it
away
with
one
hand
and
without
drawing
his
own
steel
jumped
again
at
his
assailant
an
instant
later
the
two
blackbeards
were
clenched
in
a
death
grapple
schwandorf
found
his
long
knife
useless
and
dropped
it
he
strove
for
a
hold
but
found
it
blocked
mckay
though
an
indifferent
swordsman
was
a
formidable
wrestler
and
fist
fighter
and
the
advantage
in
weight
was
more
than
offset
by
the
american
quickness
and
wiry
strength
science
was
thrown
to
the
winds
a
heaving
choking
wrenching
it
was
stumbling
over
bodies
each
straining
every
muscle
trying
every
hold
to
twist
and
break
the
other
and
batter
him
down
to
death
smashing
fist
blows
brought
blood
dripping
from
their
faces
grips
forced
gasps
from
their
lungs
and
superhuman
spasms
of
resistance
from
their
outraged
nerve
centers
they
fell
across
a
corpse
rolled
on
the
ground
throttled
kicked
struck
and
tore
finally
in
a
furious
outburst
of
energy
the
american
fought
his
enemy
down
under
him
clamped
his
body
with
iron
knees
and
crashed
a
terrific
punch
squarely
between
the
german
glaring
eyes
schwandorf
went
limp
at
that
instant
a
backward
eddy
of
the
battle
surged
over
the
pair
the
maniacal
red
bones
fighting
to
the
last
bitter
drop
of
doom
found
two
white
men
under
their
feet
screeching
snarling
they
fell
on
them
like
wild
beasts
tearing
with
tooth
and
nail
their
arrows
were
gone
their
darts
exhausted
and
no
spearman
was
among
them
they
fought
with
nature
weapons
while
above
them
one
lone
clubman
struggled
to
swing
down
his
lethal
bludgeon
without
killing
his
fellows
mckay
wrenching
his
machete
loose
and
gripping
it
with
both
hands
got
its
point
upward
and
jabbed
blindly
at
the
weight
of
flesh
bearing
him
down
faintly
to
his
ears
came
yells
of
rage
and
the
impact
of
blows
the
battle
roars
of
tim
and
knowlton
who
with
their
machetes
were
cleaving
a
way
to
their
captain
but
the
beastly
demons
over
him
still
crushed
him
down
on
schwandorf
smothering
him
under
the
burden
of
bodies
dead
and
alive
his
stabs
grew
weak
exhaustion
and
lack
of
air
were
killing
him
more
surely
than
the
savages
pedro
lourenço
josé
and
the
inexplicable
rand
came
slashing
and
clubbing
a
path
of
their
own
to
the
beleaguered
scot
the
brazilians
cutting
straight
ahead
with
deadly
surety
the
painted
peruvian
chopping
and
thrusting
with
a
fixed
grin
rand
swinging
the
gun
butt
down
on
head
after
head
from
still
another
direction
yuara
and
his
satellite
came
boring
in
with
spears
snatched
from
dead
hands
the
three
rescue
parties
reached
the
squirming
heap
at
almost
the
same
moment
but
yuara
was
the
one
whose
arrival
counted
most
in
one
last
convulsive
struggle
mckay
heaved
himself
up
until
he
was
once
more
on
his
knees
his
head
came
out
of
the
welter
his
mouth
wide
and
gulping
for
breath
the
lone
clubman
grunted
swung
his
weapon
high
and
with
all
the
power
of
his
muscular
body
drove
it
down
at
that
upturned
unprotected
face
with
a
mighty
plunge
yuara
threw
himself
over
the
captain
his
spear
sank
into
the
stomach
of
the
clubman
but
the
heavy
wooden
war
hammer
fell
with
crushing
force
as
the
red
bone
collapsed
with
the
spear
head
buried
in
his
middle
his
slayer
also
dropped
under
that
terrible
stroke
with
head
mangled
beyond
recognition
yuara
son
of
rana
warrior
of
suba
who
owed
his
life
to
mckay
rough
surgery
had
paid
his
debt
under
the
impact
of
his
body
mckay
also
slumped
forward
senseless
over
them
now
burst
the
bloodiest
berserk
battle
of
that
bloody
day
the
soldiers
the
bushmen
and
the
reclaimed
raposa
already
smeared
from
head
to
foot
with
red
stains
from
their
own
veins
and
those
of
foemen
went
stark
mad
before
their
united
ferocity
the
men
of
umanuh
dropped
as
if
rolled
under
by
an
inexorable
machine
of
war
backward
they
reeled
striving
now
to
escape
the
red
wall
of
cold
steel
surging
at
them
only
to
fall
under
a
fresh
attack
of
ravening
mayorunas
who
came
pouring
in
upon
them
from
the
sides
the
last
of
the
group
lurched
headless
to
the
ground
under
a
decapitating
from
the
awful
club
of
monitaya
himself
then
knowlton
his
lifeblood
still
draining
slowly
but
surely
away
through
his
wounded
shoulder
pitched
on
his
face
and
was
still
back
gasped
tim
git
looey
and
cap
out
o
this
here
you
raposy
lend
a
hand
the
raposa
his
green
eyes
ablaze
and
his
obdurate
calmness
totally
gone
glared
around
as
if
seeking
one
more
red
bone
to
kill
then
as
tim
heaved
the
lieutenant
across
his
shoulders
and
went
lunging
across
contorted
bodies
toward
the
he
ran
back
to
the
heap
where
mckay
lay
and
dug
him
clear
lourenço
aided
him
in
lifting
the
captain
and
they
bore
him
off
after
knowlton
pedro
and
josé
shoved
the
other
bodies
aside
until
they
uncovered
the
prone
figure
of
schwandorf
a
ghastly
form
dyed
from
hair
to
heels
with
the
blood
of
the
cannibals
whom
he
had
led
there
to
all
appearances
he
was
dead
yet
the
brazilian
and
the
peruvian
looked
keenly
at
him
then
at
each
other
there
is
a
saying
is
there
not
that
the
devil
takes
care
of
his
own
grinned
josé
it
would
be
sad
if
this
man
should
yet
live
and
escape
see
what
is
that
tall
red
bone
doing
over
yonder
pedro
followed
his
pointing
finger
he
saw
no
such
red
bone
as
josé
had
mentioned
but
when
he
looked
back
at
schwandorf
he
noticed
something
that
made
him
glance
quickly
at
josé
once
more
ah
yes
señor
schwandorf
is
truly
dead
the
peruvian
added
wiping
his
machete
carelessly
on
one
bare
leg
whether
or
not
the
devil
takes
care
of
his
own
as
i
was
saying
there
is
no
doubt
that
now
is
with
the
devil
so
since
we
can
do
nothing
for
him
let
us
look
after
the
two
north
american
señores
pedro
with
a
grim
smile
turned
with
him
toward
the
tribal
houses
there
was
nothing
else
for
them
to
do
for
the
mayorunas
now
were
dispatching
the
last
survivors
of
the
attacking
force
before
the
pair
entered
the
low
doorway
a
long
triumphant
yell
burst
from
the
hoarse
throats
of
the
men
of
monitaya
of
all
the
red
bones
who
had
swept
in
such
ghoulish
glee
into
that
clearing
not
one
now
remained
alive
at
that
shout
of
victory
and
the
entrance
of
the
men
to
whose
precautions
and
prowess
they
owed
so
much
the
women
flocked
again
into
the
center
of
the
and
the
children
dived
out
through
the
tunnels
to
behold
the
battlefield
though
bullets
and
arrows
had
come
through
the
doorway
those
inside
had
escaped
all
injury
by
hugging
the
protective
earth
embankment
or
taking
refuge
in
the
vacant
shafts
under
the
walls
now
the
older
women
experienced
in
treatment
of
wounds
busied
themselves
with
the
white
warriors
while
the
younger
ones
fetched
water
and
pieces
of
isca
a
natural
styptic
made
by
ants
or
made
up
pads
of
poultices
of
healing
herbs
tim
who
had
expected
to
play
surgeon
with
his
crude
knowledge
of
first
aid
found
himself
not
only
relieved
of
his
job
but
being
bathed
and
plastered
with
the
others
he
josé
pedro
lourenço
and
even
rand
were
gashed
by
thrusts
from
broken
spear
hafts
bleeding
from
open
bites
ripped
by
glancing
sweeps
of
clubs
bruised
by
fierce
blows
minor
injuries
all
but
such
as
might
easily
have
resulted
in
blood
poisoning
unless
given
prompt
attention
later
on
they
were
to
be
thankful
for
those
ministrations
but
now
they
tolerated
them
only
because
they
could
do
nothing
for
the
captain
and
the
lieutenant
mckay
and
knowlton
were
under
the
direct
and
capable
treatment
of
the
wives
of
the
great
chief
of
the
two
mckay
looked
by
far
the
worse
but
actually
was
in
much
better
condition
from
the
waist
up
he
was
clawed
bitten
and
bruised
so
badly
that
he
was
a
fearsome
spectacle
his
left
arm
was
dislocated
three
fingers
of
his
right
hand
were
broken
and
his
muscles
were
so
wrenched
that
for
a
week
afterward
he
moved
like
a
cripple
but
his
present
unconsciousness
was
largely
due
to
exhaustion
and
partial
asphyxiation
knowlton
whose
skin
was
comparatively
unmarked
but
whose
veins
had
continued
to
pour
vital
fluid
from
his
gaping
bullet
wound
during
his
stubborn
fight
now
was
badly
weakened
but
whatever
could
be
done
for
him
was
being
done
and
the
others
could
only
stand
by
the
women
not
engaged
in
caring
for
the
fighting
visitors
soon
found
themselves
busy
with
their
own
male
relatives
who
came
stumbling
in
by
themselves
or
were
carried
by
others
the
red
bones
though
finally
annihilated
had
made
their
mark
in
the
mayoruna
tribe
at
that
moment
of
monitaya
warriors
lay
dead
among
the
bodies
of
their
enemies
and
before
the
next
sunrise
several
more
passed
on
to
join
the
spirits
of
their
comrades
in
arms
yet
all
who
survived
though
some
were
crippled
for
life
thought
only
of
the
victory
and
gloated
on
their
scars
of
combat
as
for
those
who
had
fallen
they
were
dead
had
died
as
mayorunas
should
and
so
needed
no
sympathy
or
regret
even
now
their
bodies
were
being
collected
for
immediate
transportation
into
the
forest
where
in
accordance
with
the
tribal
custom
they
would
be
burned
some
of
the
men
who
brought
in
the
wounded
men
continued
on
to
the
bushmen
and
in
significant
sign
manual
requested
a
loan
of
their
machetes
having
received
them
they
hastened
out
to
join
those
who
equipped
with
hardwood
knives
were
gathering
the
sinister
trophies
of
triumph
before
heaving
the
dead
red
bones
out
to
the
waiting
vultures
urrrgh
growled
tim
was
a
lovely
scrap
but
i
wisht
i
was
somewheres
else
now
it
over
while
ye
was
away

brought

the
fists
and
feet

a
crazy
guy
i

the
world

like
a
bowery
cop
full
o
bootleg
booze
the
raposa
green
eyes
glimmered
in
fact
they
almost
twinkled
and
for
the
second
time
the
wild
man
spoke
i
am
not
crazy
huh
my
gosh

spoke
four
whole
words
that
makes

in
a
week

far
bein
concerned
do
let
it
worry
ye
none
we
all
crazy
too
or
we
would
be
here
under
cover
of
his
banter
the
veteran
eyed
the
other
sharply
as
he
turned
his
gaze
aside
to
the
moving
figures
about
him
he
thought
begorry
he
do
look
like
a
nut
at
that
mebbe
unscrambled
his
brains
again
here
hopin
anyways
the
big
tribe
house
now
was
full
of
life
small
groups
of
warriors
their
hurts
dressed
with
primitive
poultices
gathered
around
the
hammocks
of
those
more
seriously
injured
and
discussed
the
battle
others
came
in
bearing
armfuls
of
severed
red
bone
hands
and
feet
which
were
distributed
among
the
family
triangles
the
women
their
remedial
work
done
now
turned
to
the
clay
cooking
vessels
freshened
the
fires
stripped
the
flesh
of
their
enemies
from
the
bones
and
set
it
to
boil
among
the
hammocks
moved
the
subchiefs
their
eyes
still
shining
with
the
light
of
battle
examining
the
wounded
men
and
glancing
at
the
preparations
for
the
dire
feast
to
come
over
all
drifted
a
steadily
thickening
smoke
which
rolled
up
and
out
through
the
vent
in
the
peak
of
the
roof
where
the
setting
sun
smote
it
with
rays
of
gleaming
red
around
the
gleamed
the
red
light
of
the
cooking
fires
among
whose
burning
fagots
bubbled
the
red
pots
and
pans
red
men
and
women
passing
about
in
a
crimson
setting
the
scene
formed
a
fitting
end
to
the
reddest
day
in
the
unwritten
records
of
the
tribe
who
since
noon
had
proved
themselves
worthy
champions
of
the
ancient
god
whose
name
they
never
had
heard
but
who
nevertheless
ruled
their
lives
the
red
god
mars
monitaya
himself
head
high
and
chest
swelling
with
pride
now
came
striding
lithely
in
followed
by
a
young
warrior
carrying
something
he
stopped
between
the
hammocks
of
mckay
and
knowlton
studied
their
faces
gravely
listened
as
his
wives
told
of
what
had
been
done
at
almost
the
same
moment
the
eyes
of
the
pair
slowly
opened
and
stared
up
at
him
the
face
of
the
great
chief
melted
in
one
of
its
transforming
smiles
the
captain
and
the
lieutenant
grinned
pluckily
back
with
a
nod
of
silent
comradeship
the
big
savage
turned
to
his
own
hammock
and
sat
down
two
of
his
women
built
up
the
royal
fire
and
fell
to
work
on
the
things
handed
over
by
the
young
warrior
tim
and
his
mates
took
one
squint
at
what
they
were
doing
then
they
moved
between
the
fire
and
the
two
officers
blocking
the
view
time
ye
woke
up
and
listened
to
the
birdies
tim
chaffed
fight
over
and
we
been
hangin

chapter
xxvi
partners
seven
men
squatted
around
a
camp
fire
on
the
river
bank
beyond
them
half
revealed
by
the
flickering
light
of
the
flames
rose
the
poles
of
a
wherein
empty
hammocks
hung
waiting
at
the
edge
of
the
water
lay
two
canoes
five
of
the
men
wore
the
habiliments
of
civilized
beings
though
their
shirts
and
breeches
were
so
tattered
and
stained
that
a
civilized
community
would
have
looked
askance
at
them
the
other
two
were
nude
as
savages
but
their
beards
and
tanned
skins
were
those
of
white
men
beards
of
varying
length
seemed
in
fact
to
be
the
fashion
for
everyone
present
wore
one
and
all
but
two
were
very
dark
of
the
odd
pair
one
thin
face
was
partly
covered
by
stubby
blond
hair
while
the
other
jaw
was
masked
by
a
growth
of
unmistakable
red
lifting
their
cigarettes
the
blond
man
and
a
tall
comrade
moved
their
arms
stiffly
as
if
still
hampered
by
injuries
newly
healed
scars
showed
on
the
skins
of
the
rest
injuns
are
a
funny
lot
declared
the
one
monitaya
now
keeps
us
a
couple
weeks
doctors
us
half
to
death
feeds
us
till
we
gag
gives
us
new
canoes
sends
a
platoon
o
hard
guys
with
us
to
see
that
we
git
to
the
river
safe
and
do
even
say
no
handshake
no
luck
fellers
jest
a
grin
like
we
was
goin
to
walk
round
the
house
and
come
right
back
and
the
lads
that
come
out
with
us
done
the
same
turned
round
and
quit
us
without
a
word
i
bet
if
we
lived
amongst
long
we
git
to
be
dummies
too
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
for
no
apparent
reason
all
glanced
at
one
of
the
naked
men
on
whose
skin
faintly
showed
reddish
streaks
you
would
he
said
huh
gee
rand
talkin
again
first
time
since
we
licked
them
red
boneheads
two
whole
words
go
easy
feller
easy
i
will
be
easy
but
it
time
i
talked
i
am
not
dumb
i
am
not
crazy
the
man
spoke
slowly
as
if
forming
each
word
in
his
mind
before
pronouncing
it
the
rest
squatted
with
eyes
riveted
on
his
face
i
have
not
talked
before
because
i
had
to
find
myself
i
had
to
hear
english
spoken
and
become
used
to
it
i
had
to
put
things
together
in
my
mind
even
now
some
things
are
not
clear
but
i
can
talk
and
make
sense
of
my
talk
i
will
tell
what
i
can
remember
first
tell
me
one
thing
mckay
am
i
a
murderer
a
murderer
you
if
you
are
we
never
heard
of
it
a
man
named
schmidt
gustav
schmidt
german
merchant
at
manaos
gustav
schmidt
piggy
little
runt
bald
and
fat
with
a
scar
across
his
chin
yes
he
dead
but
you
did
kill
him
he
was
shot
a
little
while
ago
by
a
young
brazilian
for
getting
too
intimate
with
the
young
fellow
wife
we
heard
about
it
while
we
were
in
manaos
and
saw
his
picture
what
about
him
i
thought
i
killed
him
i
struck
him
with
a
bottle
i
was
told
he
was
dead
how
long
have
i
been
here
you
left
the
states
in
it
is
now
five
years
my
god
what
has
happened
in
that
time
is
my
mother
well
the
others
looked
pityingly
at
him
slowly
knowlton
spoke
your
mother
died
two
years
ago
from
heart
trouble
your
uncle
philip
dawson
also
is
dead
rand
jaw
set
the
others
shifted
their
gaze
and
busied
themselves
with
making
new
cigarettes
spending
much
time
over
the
simple
task
poor
mother
rand
said
huskily
uncle
phil
he
was
a
good
old
scout
and
i
was
here
buried
alive
only
half
alive
my
head
tell
me
what
happened
on
the
night
before
you
dressed
my
lame
foot
i
remember
clearly
everything
from
the
time
i
woke
in
the
canoe
before
daylight
that
morning
before
that
there
is
a
blur
knowlton
sketched
the
events
of
that
night
and
told
also
of
the
glimpse
which
he
and
pedro
had
caught
of
the
wild
man
while
waiting
outside
the
house
of
the
red
bone
chief
a
flash
lit
up
rand
face
so
that
is
how
i
got
my
sore
head
you
struck
me
with
your
rifle
butt
that
explains
much
before
i
became
a
wild
beast
i
was
shot
in
the
head
the
bullet
did
not
go
through
the
skull
it
struck
me
a
terrible
blow
on
the
crown
when
i
recovered
consciousness
i
was
not
myself
i
have
never
been
the
same
until
gee
cripes
exploded
tim
that
it
i
seen
that
same
thing
up
home
bug
sullivan
it
was
when
he
was
a
feller
he
tumbled
downstairs
and
hit
his
head
and
for
ten
years
he
was
foolish
then
a
brick
fell
off
a
buildin
and
landed
on
his
bean
it
knocked
him
for
a
gool
but
when
he
come
out
of
it
he
was
bright
as
a
new
dime
looey
when
ye
busted
rand
with
yer
gun
ye
jarred
somethin
loose
inside
and
now
good
as
any
of
us
by
george
you
right
cried
the
lieutenant
things
like
that
do
happen
i
heard
of
them
have
you
rod
mckay
nodded
that
is
it
affirmed
the
raposa
i
have
not
been
insane
but
much
was
gone
from
me
my
mind
was
a
house
full
of
closed
doors
which
i
could
not
open
i
knew
who
i
was
and
why
i
was
here
but
i
knew
also
that
something
had
happened
to
my
brain
knew
i
was
defective
believed
i
was
wanted
for
murder
so
i
could
not
go
out
i
could
only
stay
here
prowl
the
jungle
live
the
jungle
life
now
that
the
closed
doors
have
opened
again
others
have
swung
shut
i
can
not
remember
much
of
my
life
here
some
things
are
clear
too
clear
torturings
and
horrible
feasts
perhaps
i
should
be
grateful
that
some
things
are
forgotten
but
now
my
life
up
to
the
time
i
was
shot
is
plain
again
i
talked
with
a
man
who
had
traveled
the
amazon
and
the
andes
i
never
had
seen
either
and
i
was
ripe
for
something
new
a
steamer
was
just
sailing
south
and
i
got
aboard
in
a
hurry
no
baggage
but
a
suitcase
and
five
thousand
dollars
i
had
traveled
a
good
deal
europe
canada
japan
and
always
found
that
plenty
of
money
was
all
a
man
needed
thought
it
was
the
same
way
here
i
learned
better
i
visited
rio
a
few
hours
and
then
came
up
along
the
coast
and
inland
at
manaos
i
got
into
trouble
went
ashore
and
got
to
drinking
with
two
germans
one
of
them
schmidt
grew
ugly
and
said
a
lot
of
rotten
things
about
the
states
tell
me
something
men
is
the
war
over
and
did
our
country
get
into
it
it
is
and
it
did
and
knowlton
outlined
the
epochal
occurrences
of
the
world
conflict
and
i
missed
that
too
mourned
rand
but
i
started
a
war
of
my
own
down
here
anyway
when
i
quit
seeing
red
i
had
a
bottle
neck
in
my
hand
and
both
the
germans
were
down
somebody
said
schmidt
was
dead
a
couple
of
men
tried
to
grab
me
i
fought
my
way
clear
hid
awhile
got
back
on
the
boat
without
being
noticed
and
paid
one
of
the
crew
well
to
hide
me
in
the
hold
and
feed
me
nearly
died
from
heat
and
suffocation
down
there
but
lived
to
reach
iquitos
where
my
man
smuggled
me
ashore
i
thought
i
was
safe
there
but
before
i
could
make
a
move
to
travel
on
i
fell
into
the
hands
of
that
cursed
schwandorf
schwandorf
schwandorf
he
was
in
iquitos
the
sailor
who
hid
me
must
have
sold
me
out
to
him
schwandorf
told
me
he
was
a
police
officer
in
brazilian
employ
said
he
would
take
me
back
to
stand
trial
for
murdering
schmidt
the
dirty
blackmailer
took
all
my
money
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
and
take
me
to
a
place
the
safe
place
was
up
this
river
i
came
up
here
with
him
in
a
canoe
paddled
by
some
tough
peruvians
then
he
began
trying
to
bully
me
into
doing
dirty
work
for
him
running
women
into
peru
i
saw
red
again
and
jumped
for
him
he
gave
me
that
bullet
on
the
head
after
that
things
are
badly
blurred
i
found
myself
among
savages
how
i
got
there
why
i
was
killed
i
do
know
schwandorf
was
there
awhile
then
he
went
away
with
his
gang
leaving
me
very
sure
of
only
one
thing
i
was
a
murderer
and
would
be
executed
if
caught
and
well
that
about
all
except
that
the
savages
seemed
rather
afraid
of
me
and
did
want
me
around
there
was
another
silence
then
lourenço
remarked
between
schmidt
and
schwandorf
you
have
suffered
much
it
is
possible
that
there
was
a
connection
of
some
sort
between
them
but
neither
can
ever
trouble
you
again
i
do
not
see
why
schwandorf
took
the
trouble
even
to
put
you
among
the
red
bones
one
more
bullet
would
have
ended
you
any
ideas
on
that
subject
josé
asked
mckay
only
a
guess
capitan
i
was
not
here
five
years
ago
and
i
knew
nothing
of
schwandorf
then
but
i
know
he
always
schemed
for
his
own
good
and
overlooked
no
chances
so
perhaps
finding
this
man
not
dead
but
darkened
in
mind
by
his
bullet
he
thought
he
might
be
able
to
use
him
in
some
way
at
some
future
time
a
dead
man
is
not
useful
to
anyone
if
this
man
should
never
become
valuable
he
could
live
and
die
forgotten
among
savages
where
he
could
do
schwandorf
no
harm
if
worth
something
he
could
be
found
again
prussian
efficiency
nodded
mckay
then
he
spoke
directly
to
rand
since
you
mentally
sound
he
went
on
we
may
as
well
tell
you
how
you
happen
to
be
among
us
we
three
merry
tim
and
i
came
here
to
find
you
the
settlement
of
the
dawson
estate
hinges
on
you
on
me
how
i
no
claim
to
it
paul
dawson
uncle
phil
son
is
dead
too
killed
in
action
in
the
argonne
you
next
in
line
mckay
watched
him
keenly
so
did
knowlton
the
jubilance
did
not
come
so
paul
gone
was
rand
reply
hard
luck
suppose
i
had
been
found
then
what
in
due
time
the
money
would
go
to
a
school
boys
school
orphans
blind
cripples
hardly
mckay
mouth
curved
sardonically
he
named
a
preparatory
school
of
the
exclusive
type
rand
mouth
also
twisted
that
hotbed
of
snobbery
that
twin
sister
to
a
society
girls
finishing
school
might
have
known
it
though
uncle
phil
was
fond
of
the
sort
of
education
that
does
educate
i
glad
you
fellows
found
me
i
go
home
and
collect
every
red
cent
just
to
keep
it
out
of
the
hands
of
the
supercilious
bunch
of
bishops
that
run
that
knowlton
chuckled
appreciatively
it
not
the
sort
of
school
that
breeds
for
a
fact
he
agreed
but
you
do
seem
much
enthused
over
having
a
couple
of
millions
dropped
into
your
lap
rand
sat
still
his
face
remained
cheerless
impassive
what
is
money
he
said
presently
i
always
had
plenty
of
it
what
it
done
for
me
when
you
have
it
you
ca
tell
whether
people
are
friends
to
you
or
only
friends
to
your
money
it
makes
you
cynical
suspicious
what
worse
you
depend
too
much
on
it
you
think
it
will
do
everything
then
if
you
land
in
a
place
where
it
no
good
and
you
have
got
it
anyway
you
up
against
it
a
good
deal
harder
than
the
fellow
who
never
had
it
but
knows
how
to
handle
himself
without
it
true
for
ye
tim
concurred
heartily
all
the
same
i
bet
change
yer
tune
after
ye
git
home
will
i
the
green
eyes
impaled
him
maybe
but
i
do
think
so
had
my
run
at
blowing
in
money
on
myself
alone
now
i
going
to
blow
some
on
other
folks
i
missed
out
on
the
war
but
there
must
be
quite
a
few
of
our
fellows
lamed
and
crippled
by
that
war
and
i
gamble
that
the
government
is
treating
them
all
like
princes
i
know
something
about
governments
princes
say
feller
there
many
a
dog
that
took
better
care
of
than
some
of
our
boys
back
home
so
i
thought
the
income
from
a
couple
of
millions
along
with
some
of
the
principal
will
do
a
lot
of
good
if
used
right
and
his
eyes
turned
to
the
three
bushmen
do
not
look
at
us
in
that
way
said
lourenço
reading
his
thought
we
can
make
all
the
money
we
need
and
we
came
with
the
capitao
and
his
comrades
only
because
we
wanted
excitement
use
your
money
for
the
crippled
men
who
need
it
and
josé
martinez
also
is
well
able
to
provide
for
his
wants
coolly
added
the
other
naked
man
i
am
here
only
to
settle
old
scores
and
now
they
are
settled
each
man
is
goaded
by
his
own
spur
money
wine
women
excitement
revenge
money
is
not
mine
he
yawned
arose
stretched
like
a
cat
and
stepped
toward
his
hammock
the
two
brasilians
also
moved
toward
the
the
others
stood
a
moment
longer
beside
the
fire
well
since
we
three
did
come
here
because
of
wine
women
or
revenge
knowlton
said
whimsically
it
must
have
been
for
money
and
excitement
do
know
which
was
the
stronger
lure
but
if
we
could
have
only
one
of
the
two
i
think
we
let
the
money
slide
how
about
it
rod
right
and
rand
let
me
say
this
before
we
knew
you
we
had
an
impression
that
you
were
more
or
less
of
a
worthless
pup
we
changed
our
ideas
if
you
ever
go
broke
and
want
to
hit
a
trail
into
some
new
place
to
make
a
strike
of
your
own
and
you
need
partners
let
us
know
and
he
held
out
his
hand
the
naked
millionaire
took
it
for
the
first
time
a
faint
smile
lightened
his
face
i
do
that
partners
he
promised
yeah
that
the
word
pardners
only
timmy
ryan
bucks
at
ever
travelin
back
into
this
here
now
jungle
i
got
enough
of
it
right
now
i
homesick
so
say
we
all
affirmed
knowlton
now
let
turn
in
but
tim
stood
a
little
longer
looking
out
at
the
moonlit
river
and
the
two
waiting
canoes
his
gaze
roved
along
the
stream
northward
he
lifted
his
head
opened
his
mouth
expanded
his
lungs
and
then
the
astounded
denizens
of
forest
and
stream
cut
short
their
discordant
concert
to
listen
to
something
they
never
had
heard
before
and
never
would
hear
again
a
great
voice
thundering
a
censored
version
of
a
north
american
army
song
home
boys
home
home
we
want
to
be
home
boys
home
in
god
countree
we
raise
ol
glory
to
the
top
o
the
pole
and
we
all
come
back
not
a
soul
