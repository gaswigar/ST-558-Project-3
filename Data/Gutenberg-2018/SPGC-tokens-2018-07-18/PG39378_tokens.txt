sir
thank
you
said
hutton
without
turning
round
janet
parlourmaid
was
so
ugly
ugly
on
purpose
it
always
seemed
to
him
malignantly
criminally
ugly
that
he
could
not
bear
to
look
at
her
more
than
was
necessary
the
door
closed
left
to
himself
hutton
got
up
and
began
to
wander
round
the
room
looking
with
meditative
eyes
at
the
familiar
objects
it
contained
photographs
of
greek
statuary
photographs
of
the
roman
forum
coloured
prints
of
italian
masterpieces
all
very
safe
and
well
known
poor
dear
janet
what
a
prig
what
an
intellectual
snob
her
real
taste
was
illustrated
in
that
by
the
pavement
artist
the
one
she
had
paid
half
a
crown
for
and
shillings
for
the
frame
how
often
his
had
heard
her
tell
the
story
how
often
expatiate
on
the
beauties
of
that
skilful
imitation
of
an
oleograph
a
real
artist
in
the
streets
and
you
could
hear
the
capital
a
in
artist
as
she
spoke
the
words
she
made
you
feel
that
part
of
his
glory
had
entered
into
janet
spence
when
she
tendered
him
that
for
the
copy
of
the
oleograph
she
was
implying
a
compliment
to
her
own
taste
and
penetration
a
genuine
old
master
for
half
a
crown
poor
dear
janet
hutton
came
to
a
pause
in
front
of
a
small
oblong
mirror
stooping
a
little
to
get
a
full
view
of
his
face
he
passed
a
white
finger
over
his
moustache
it
was
as
curly
as
freshly
auburn
as
it
had
been
twenty
years
ago
his
hair
still
retained
its
colour
and
there
was
no
sign
of
baldness
yet
only
a
certain
elevation
of
the
brow
shakespearean
thought
hutton
with
a
smile
as
he
surveyed
the
smooth
and
polished
expanse
of
his
forehead
others
abide
our
question
thou
art
free
footsteps
in
the
sea
majesty
shakespeare
thou
shouldst
be
living
at
this
hour
no
that
was
milton
was
it
milton
the
lady
of
christ
there
was
no
lady
about
him
he
was
what
the
women
would
call
a
manly
man
that
was
why
they
liked
him
for
the
curly
auburn
moustache
and
the
discreet
redolence
of
tobacco
hutton
smiled
again
he
enjoyed
making
fun
of
himself
lady
of
christ
no
no
he
was
the
christ
of
ladies
very
pretty
very
pretty
the
christ
of
ladies
hutton
wished
there
were
somebody
he
could
tell
the
joke
to
poor
dear
janet
would
appreciate
it
alas
he
straightened
himself
up
patted
his
hair
and
resumed
his
peregrination
damn
the
roman
forum
he
hated
those
dreary
photographs
suddenly
he
became
aware
that
janet
spence
was
in
the
room
standing
near
the
door
hutton
started
as
though
he
had
been
taken
in
some
felonious
act
to
make
these
silent
and
spectral
appearances
was
one
of
janet
spence
peculiar
talents
perhaps
she
had
been
there
all
the
time
had
seen
him
looking
at
himself
in
the
mirror
impossible
but
still
it
was
disquieting
oh
you
gave
me
such
a
surprise
said
hutton
recovering
his
smile
and
advancing
with
outstretched
hand
to
meet
her
miss
spence
was
smiling
too
her
gioconda
smile
he
had
once
called
it
in
a
moment
of
flattery
miss
spence
had
taken
the
compliment
seriously
and
had
always
tried
to
live
up
to
the
leonardo
standard
she
smiled
on
his
silence
while
hutton
shook
hands
that
was
part
of
the
gioconda
business
i
hope
you
well
said
hutton
you
look
it
what
a
queer
face
she
had
that
small
mouth
pursed
forward
by
the
gioconda
expression
into
a
little
snout
with
a
round
hole
in
the
middle
as
though
for
whistling
it
was
like
a
penholder
seen
from
the
front
above
the
mouth
a
nose
finely
aquiline
eyes
large
lustrous
and
dark
with
the
largeness
lustre
and
darkness
that
seems
to
invite
sties
and
an
occasional
suffusion
they
were
fine
eyes
but
unchangingly
grave
the
penholder
might
do
its
gioconda
trick
but
the
eyes
never
altered
in
their
earnestness
above
them
a
pair
of
boldly
arched
heavily
pencilled
black
eyebrows
lent
a
surprising
air
of
power
as
of
a
roman
matron
to
the
upper
portion
of
the
face
her
hair
was
dark
and
equally
roman
agrippina
from
the
brows
upward
i
thought
i
just
look
in
on
my
way
home
hutton
went
on
ah
it
good
to
be
back
here
he
indicated
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
the
flowers
in
the
vases
the
sunshine
and
greenery
beyond
the
windows
it
good
to
be
back
in
the
country
after
a
stuffy
day
of
business
in
town
miss
spence
who
had
sat
down
pointed
to
a
chair
at
her
side
no
really
i
cant
sit
down
hutton
protested
i
must
get
back
to
see
how
poor
emily
is
she
was
rather
seedy
this
morning
he
sat
down
nevertheless
it
these
wretched
liver
chills
she
always
getting
them
women
he
broke
off
and
coughed
so
as
to
hide
the
fact
that
he
had
uttered
he
was
about
to
say
that
women
with
weak
digestions
ought
not
to
marry
but
the
remark
was
too
cruel
and
he
did
really
believe
it
janet
spence
moreover
was
a
believer
in
eternal
flames
and
spiritual
attachments
she
hopes
to
be
well
enough
he
added
to
see
you
at
luncheon
can
you
come
do
he
smiled
persuasively
it
my
invitation
too
you
know
she
dropped
her
eyes
and
hutton
almost
thought
that
he
detected
a
certain
reddening
of
the
cheek
it
was
a
tribute
he
stroked
his
moustache
i
should
like
to
come
if
you
think
emily
really
well
enough
to
have
a
visitor
of
course
you
do
her
good
you
do
us
both
good
in
married
life
three
is
often
better
company
than
two
oh
you
cynical
hutton
always
had
a
desire
to
say
whenever
that
last
word
was
spoken
it
irritated
him
more
than
any
other
word
in
the
language
but
instead
of
barking
he
made
haste
to
protest
no
no
i
only
speaking
a
melancholy
truth
reality
does
always
come
up
to
the
ideal
you
know
but
that
does
make
me
believe
any
the
less
in
the
ideal
indeed
i
believe
in
it
passionately
the
ideal
of
a
matrimony
between
two
people
in
perfect
accord
i
think
it
realisable
i
sure
it
is
he
paused
significantly
and
looked
at
her
with
an
arch
expression
a
virgin
of
but
still
unwithered
she
had
her
charms
and
there
was
something
really
rather
enigmatic
about
her
miss
spence
made
no
reply
but
continued
to
smile
there
were
times
when
hutton
got
rather
bored
with
the
gioconda
he
stood
up
i
must
really
be
going
now
farewell
mysterious
gioconda
the
smile
grew
intenser
focused
itself
as
it
were
in
a
narrower
snout
hutton
made
a
cinquecento
gesture
and
kissed
her
extended
hand
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
done
such
a
thing
the
action
seemed
not
to
be
resented
i
look
forward
to
do
you
for
answer
hutton
once
more
kissed
her
hand
then
turned
to
go
miss
spence
accompanied
him
to
the
porch
where
your
car
she
asked
i
left
it
at
the
gate
of
the
drive
i
come
and
see
you
off
no
no
hutton
was
playful
but
determined
you
must
do
no
such
thing
i
simply
forbid
you
but
i
should
like
to
come
miss
spence
protested
throwing
a
rapid
gioconda
at
him
hutton
held
up
his
hand
no
he
repeated
and
then
with
a
gesture
that
was
almost
the
blowing
of
a
kiss
he
started
to
run
down
the
drive
lightly
on
his
toes
with
long
bounding
strides
like
a
boy
he
was
proud
of
that
run
it
was
quite
marvellously
youthful
still
he
was
glad
the
drive
was
no
longer
at
the
last
bend
before
passing
out
of
sight
of
the
house
he
halted
and
turned
round
miss
spence
was
still
standing
on
the
steps
smiling
her
smile
he
waved
his
hand
and
this
time
quite
definitely
and
overtly
wafted
a
kiss
in
her
direction
then
breaking
once
more
into
his
magnificent
canter
he
rounded
the
last
dark
promontory
of
trees
once
out
of
sight
of
the
house
he
let
his
high
paces
decline
to
a
trot
and
finally
to
a
walk
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
began
wiping
his
neck
inside
his
collar
what
fools
what
fools
had
there
ever
been
such
an
ass
as
poor
dear
janet
spence
never
unless
it
was
himself
decidedly
he
was
the
more
malignant
fool
since
he
at
least
was
aware
of
his
folly
and
still
persisted
in
it
why
did
he
persist
ah
the
problem
that
was
himself
the
problem
that
was
other
people
he
had
reached
the
gate
a
large
motor
was
standing
at
the
side
of
the
road
home
the
chauffeur
touched
his
cap
and
stop
at
the
on
the
way
as
usual
hutton
added
as
he
opened
the
door
of
the
car
well
he
said
speaking
into
the
obscurity
that
lurked
within
oh
teddy
bear
what
an
age
you
been
it
was
a
fresh
and
childish
voice
that
spoke
the
words
there
was
the
faintest
hint
of
cockney
impurity
about
the
vowel
sounds
hutton
bent
his
large
form
and
darted
into
the
car
with
the
agility
of
an
animal
regaining
its
burrow
have
i
he
said
as
he
shut
the
door
the
machine
began
to
move
you
must
have
missed
me
a
lot
if
you
found
the
time
so
long
he
sat
back
in
the
low
seat
a
cherishing
warmth
enveloped
him
teddy
bear
and
with
a
sigh
of
contentment
a
charming
little
head
declined
on
to
hutton
shoulder
ravished
he
looked
down
sideways
at
the
round
babyish
face
do
you
know
doris
you
look
like
the
pictures
of
louise
de
kerouaille
he
passed
his
fingers
through
a
mass
of
curly
hair
who
louise
de
doris
spoke
from
remote
distances
she
was
alas
we
shall
all
be
one
of
these
days
meanwhile
hutton
covered
the
babyish
face
with
kisses
the
car
rushed
smoothly
along
mcnab
back
through
the
front
window
was
stonily
impassive
the
back
of
a
statue
your
hands
doris
whispered
oh
you
must
touch
me
they
give
me
electric
shocks
hutton
adored
her
for
the
virgin
imbecility
of
the
words
how
late
in
one
existence
one
makes
the
discovery
of
one
body
the
electricity
is
in
me
it
in
you
he
kissed
her
again
whispering
her
name
several
times
doris
doris
doris
the
scientific
appellation
of
the
he
was
thinking
as
he
kissed
the
throat
she
offered
him
white
and
extended
like
the
throat
of
a
victim
awaiting
the
sacrificial
knife
the
was
a
sausage
with
iridescent
fur
very
peculiar
or
was
doris
the
sea
cucumber
which
turns
itself
inside
out
in
moments
of
alarm
he
would
really
have
to
go
to
naples
again
just
to
see
the
aquarium
these
sea
creatures
were
fabulous
unbelievably
fantastic
oh
teddy
bear
more
zoology
but
he
was
only
a
land
animal
his
poor
little
jokes
teddy
bear
i
so
happy
so
am
i
said
hutton
was
it
true
but
i
wish
i
knew
if
it
were
right
tell
me
teddy
bear
is
it
right
or
wrong
ah
my
dear
that
just
what
i
been
wondering
for
the
last
thirty
years
be
serious
teddy
bear
i
want
to
know
if
this
is
right
if
it
right
that
i
should
be
here
with
you
and
that
we
should
love
one
another
and
that
it
should
give
me
electric
shocks
when
you
touch
me
right
well
it
certainly
good
that
you
should
have
electric
shocks
rather
than
sexual
repressions
read
freud
repressions
are
the
devil
oh
you
do
help
me
why
are
you
ever
serious
if
only
you
knew
how
miserable
i
am
sometimes
thinking
it
not
right
perhaps
you
know
there
is
a
hell
and
all
that
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
sometimes
i
think
i
ought
to
stop
loving
you
but
could
you
asked
hutton
confident
in
the
powers
of
his
seduction
and
his
moustache
no
teddy
bear
you
know
i
could
but
i
could
run
away
i
could
hide
from
you
i
could
lock
myself
up
and
force
myself
not
to
come
to
you
silly
little
thing
he
tightened
his
embrace
oh
dear
i
hope
it
is
wrong
and
there
are
times
when
i
do
care
if
it
is
hutton
was
touched
he
had
a
certain
protective
affection
for
this
little
creature
he
laid
his
cheek
against
her
hair
and
so
interlaced
they
sat
in
silence
while
the
car
swaying
and
pitching
a
little
as
it
hastened
along
seemed
to
draw
in
the
white
road
and
the
dusty
hedges
towards
it
devouringly
the
car
moved
on
gathered
speed
vanished
round
a
curve
and
doris
was
left
standing
by
the
at
the
still
dizzy
and
weak
with
the
languor
born
of
those
kisses
and
the
electrical
touch
of
those
gentle
hands
she
had
to
take
a
deep
breath
to
draw
herself
up
deliberately
before
she
was
strong
enough
to
start
her
homeward
walk
she
had
half
a
mile
in
which
to
invent
the
necessary
lies
alone
hutton
suddenly
found
himself
the
prey
of
an
appalling
boredom
ii
hutton
was
lying
on
the
sofa
in
her
boudoir
playing
patience
in
spite
of
the
warmth
of
the
july
evening
a
wood
fire
was
burning
on
the
hearth
a
black
pomeranian
extenuated
by
the
heat
and
the
fatigues
of
digestion
slept
before
the
blaze
phew
is
it
rather
hot
in
here
hutton
asked
as
he
entered
the
room
you
know
i
have
to
keep
warm
dear
the
voice
seemed
breaking
on
the
verge
of
tears
i
get
so
shivery
i
hope
you
better
this
evening
not
much
i
afraid
the
conversation
stagnated
hutton
stood
leaning
his
back
against
the
mantelpiece
he
looked
down
at
the
pomeranian
lying
at
his
feet
and
with
the
toe
of
his
right
boot
he
rolled
the
little
dog
over
and
rubbed
its
chest
and
belly
the
creature
lay
in
an
inert
ecstasy
hutton
continued
to
play
patience
arrived
at
an
she
altered
the
position
of
one
card
took
back
another
and
went
on
playing
her
patiences
always
came
out
libbard
thinks
i
ought
to
go
to
llandrindod
wells
this
summer
well
go
my
dear
go
most
certainly
hutton
was
thinking
of
the
events
of
the
afternoon
how
they
had
driven
doris
and
he
up
to
the
hanging
wood
had
left
the
car
to
wait
for
them
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
and
walked
together
out
into
the
windless
sunshine
of
the
chalk
down
i
to
drink
the
waters
for
my
liver
and
he
thinks
i
ought
to
have
massage
and
electric
treatment
too
hat
in
hand
doris
had
stalked
four
blue
butterflies
that
were
dancing
together
round
a
scabious
flower
with
a
motion
that
was
like
the
flickering
of
blue
fire
the
blue
fire
burst
and
scattered
into
whirling
sparks
she
had
given
chase
laughing
and
shouting
like
a
child
i
sure
it
will
do
you
good
my
dear
i
was
wondering
if
you
come
with
me
dear
but
you
know
i
going
to
scotland
at
the
end
of
the
month
hutton
looked
up
at
him
entreatingly
it
the
journey
she
said
the
thought
of
it
is
such
a
nightmare
i
do
know
if
i
can
manage
it
and
you
know
i
ca
sleep
in
hotels
and
then
there
the
luggage
and
all
the
worries
i
ca
go
alone
but
you
wo
be
alone
you
have
your
maid
with
you
he
spoke
impatiently
the
sick
woman
was
usurping
the
place
of
the
healthy
one
he
was
being
dragged
back
from
the
memory
of
the
sunlit
down
and
the
quick
laughing
girl
back
to
this
unhealthy
overheated
room
and
its
complaining
occupant
i
do
think
i
shall
be
able
to
go
but
you
must
my
dear
if
the
doctor
tells
you
to
and
besides
a
change
will
do
you
good
i
do
think
so
but
libbard
thinks
so
and
he
knows
what
he
talking
about
no
i
ca
face
it
i
too
weak
i
ca
go
alone
hutton
pulled
a
handkerchief
out
of
her
black
silk
bag
and
put
it
to
her
eyes
nonsense
my
dear
you
must
make
the
effort
i
had
rather
be
left
in
peace
to
die
here
she
was
crying
in
earnest
now
o
lord
now
do
be
reasonable
listen
now
please
hutton
only
sobbed
more
violently
oh
what
is
one
to
do
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
walked
out
of
the
room
hutton
was
aware
that
he
had
not
behaved
with
proper
patience
but
he
could
not
help
it
very
early
in
his
manhood
he
had
discovered
that
not
only
did
he
not
feel
sympathy
for
the
poor
the
weak
the
diseased
and
deformed
he
actually
hated
them
once
as
an
undergraduate
he
spent
three
days
at
a
mission
in
the
east
end
he
had
returned
filled
with
a
profound
and
ineradicable
disgust
instead
of
pitying
he
loathed
the
unfortunate
it
was
not
he
knew
a
very
comely
emotion
and
he
had
been
ashamed
of
it
at
first
in
the
end
he
had
decided
that
it
was
temperamental
inevitable
and
had
felt
no
further
qualms
emily
had
been
healthy
and
beautiful
when
he
married
her
he
had
loved
her
then
but
now
was
it
his
fault
that
she
was
like
this
hutton
dined
alone
food
and
drink
left
him
more
benevolent
than
he
had
been
before
dinner
to
make
amends
for
his
show
of
exasperation
he
went
up
to
his
wife
room
and
offered
to
read
to
her
she
was
touched
gratefully
accepted
the
offer
and
hutton
who
was
particularly
proud
of
his
accent
suggested
a
little
light
reading
in
french
french
i
am
so
fond
of
french
hutton
spoke
of
the
language
of
racine
as
though
it
were
a
dish
of
green
peas
hutton
ran
down
to
the
library
and
returned
with
a
yellow
volume
he
began
reading
the
effort
of
pronouncing
perfectly
absorbed
his
whole
attention
but
how
good
his
accent
was
the
fact
of
its
goodness
seemed
to
improve
the
quality
of
the
novel
he
was
reading
at
the
end
of
fifteen
pages
an
unmistakable
sound
aroused
him
he
looked
up
hutton
had
gone
to
sleep
he
sat
still
for
a
little
while
looking
with
a
dispassionate
curiosity
at
the
sleeping
face
once
it
had
been
beautiful
once
long
ago
the
sight
of
it
the
recollection
of
it
had
moved
him
with
an
emotion
profounder
perhaps
than
any
he
had
felt
before
or
since
now
it
was
lined
and
cadaverous
the
skin
was
stretched
tightly
over
the
cheekbones
across
the
bridge
of
the
sharp
nose
the
closed
eyes
were
set
in
profound
sockets
the
lamplight
striking
on
the
face
from
the
side
emphasised
with
light
and
shade
its
cavities
and
projections
it
was
the
face
of
a
dead
christ
by
morales
squelette
était
temps
heureux
de
he
shivered
a
little
and
tiptoed
out
of
the
room
on
the
following
day
hutton
came
down
to
luncheon
she
had
had
some
unpleasant
palpitations
during
the
night
but
she
was
feeling
better
now
besides
she
wanted
to
do
honour
to
her
guest
miss
spence
listened
to
her
complaints
about
llandrindod
wells
and
was
loud
in
sympathy
lavish
with
advice
whatever
she
said
was
always
said
with
intensity
she
leaned
forward
aimed
so
to
speak
like
a
gun
and
fired
her
words
bang
the
charge
in
her
soul
was
ignited
the
words
whizzed
forth
at
the
narrow
barrel
of
her
mouth
she
was
a
riddling
her
hostess
with
sympathy
hutton
had
undergone
similar
bombardments
mostly
of
a
literary
or
philosophic
character
bombardments
of
maeterlinck
of
besant
of
bergson
of
william
james
the
missiles
were
medical
she
talked
about
insomnia
she
expatiated
on
the
virtues
of
harmless
drugs
and
beneficent
specialists
under
the
bombardment
hutton
opened
out
like
a
flower
in
the
sun
hutton
looked
on
in
silence
the
spectacle
of
janet
spence
evoked
in
him
an
unfailing
curiosity
he
was
not
romantic
enough
to
imagine
that
every
face
masked
an
interior
physiognomy
of
beauty
or
strangeness
that
every
woman
small
talk
was
like
a
vapour
hanging
over
mysterious
gulfs
his
wife
for
example
and
doris
they
were
nothing
more
than
what
they
seemed
to
be
but
with
janet
spence
it
was
somehow
different
here
one
could
be
sure
that
there
was
some
kind
of
a
queer
face
behind
the
gioconda
smile
and
the
roman
eyebrows
the
only
question
was
what
exactly
was
there
hutton
could
never
quite
make
out
but
perhaps
you
wo
have
to
go
to
llandrindod
after
all
miss
spence
was
saying
if
you
get
well
quickly
libbard
will
let
you
off
i
only
hope
so
indeed
i
do
really
feel
rather
better
hutton
felt
ashamed
how
much
was
it
his
own
lack
of
sympathy
that
prevented
her
from
feeling
well
every
day
but
he
comforted
himself
by
reflecting
that
it
was
only
a
case
of
feeling
not
of
being
better
sympathy
does
not
mend
a
diseased
liver
or
a
weak
heart
my
dear
i
would
eat
those
red
currants
if
i
were
you
he
said
suddenly
solicitous
you
know
that
libbard
has
banned
everything
with
skins
and
pips
but
i
am
so
fond
of
them
hutton
protested
and
i
feel
so
well
do
be
a
tyrant
said
miss
spence
looking
first
at
him
and
then
at
his
wife
let
the
poor
invalid
have
what
she
fancies
it
will
do
her
good
she
laid
her
hand
on
hutton
arm
and
patted
it
affectionately
two
or
three
times
thank
you
my
dear
hutton
helped
herself
to
the
stewed
currants
well
do
blame
me
if
they
make
you
ill
again
do
i
ever
blame
you
dear
you
have
nothing
to
blame
me
for
hutton
answered
playfully
i
am
the
perfect
husband
they
sat
in
the
garden
after
luncheon
from
the
island
of
shade
under
the
old
cypress
tree
they
looked
out
across
a
flat
expanse
of
lawn
in
which
the
parterres
of
flowers
shone
with
a
metallic
brilliance
hutton
took
a
deep
breath
of
the
warm
and
fragrant
air
it
good
to
be
alive
he
said
just
to
be
alive
his
wife
echoed
stretching
one
pale
hand
into
the
sunlight
a
maid
brought
the
coffee
the
silver
pots
and
the
little
blue
cups
were
set
on
a
folding
table
near
the
group
of
chairs
oh
my
medicine
exclaimed
hutton
run
in
and
fetch
it
clara
will
you
the
white
bottle
on
the
sideboard
i
go
said
hutton
i
got
to
go
and
fetch
a
cigar
in
any
case
he
ran
in
towards
the
house
on
the
threshold
he
turned
round
for
an
instant
the
maid
was
walking
back
across
the
lawn
his
wife
was
sitting
up
in
her
engaged
in
opening
her
white
parasol
miss
spence
was
bending
over
the
table
pouring
out
the
coffee
he
passed
into
the
cool
obscurity
of
the
house
do
you
like
sugar
in
your
coffee
miss
spence
inquired
yes
please
give
me
rather
a
lot
i
drink
it
after
my
medicine
to
take
the
taste
away
hutton
leaned
back
in
her
chair
lowering
the
sunshade
over
her
eyes
so
as
to
shut
out
from
her
vision
the
burning
sky
behind
her
miss
spence
was
making
a
delicate
clinking
among
the
i
given
you
three
large
spoonfuls
that
ought
to
take
the
taste
away
and
here
comes
the
medicine
hutton
had
reappeared
carrying
a
wineglass
half
full
of
a
pale
liquid
it
smells
delicious
he
said
as
he
handed
it
to
his
wife
that
only
the
flavouring
she
drank
it
off
at
a
gulp
shuddered
and
made
a
grimace
ugh
it
so
nasty
give
me
my
coffee
miss
spence
gave
her
the
cup
she
sipped
at
it
you
made
it
like
syrup
but
it
very
nice
after
that
atrocious
medicine
at
three
hutton
complained
that
she
did
not
feel
as
well
as
she
had
done
and
went
indoors
to
lie
down
her
husband
would
have
said
something
about
the
red
currants
but
checked
himself
the
triumph
of
an
i
told
you
so
was
too
cheaply
won
instead
he
was
sympathetic
and
gave
her
his
arm
to
the
house
a
rest
will
do
you
good
he
said
by
the
way
i
sha
be
back
till
after
dinner
but
why
where
are
you
going
i
promised
to
go
to
johnson
this
evening
we
have
to
discuss
the
war
memorial
you
know
oh
i
wish
you
were
going
hutton
was
almost
in
tears
you
stay
i
do
like
being
alone
in
the
house
but
my
dear
i
promised
weeks
ago
it
was
a
bother
having
to
lie
like
this
and
now
i
must
get
back
and
look
after
miss
spence
he
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
and
went
out
again
into
the
garden
miss
spence
received
him
aimed
and
intense
your
wife
is
dreadfully
ill
she
fired
off
at
him
i
thought
she
cheered
up
so
much
when
you
came
that
was
purely
nervous
purely
nervous
i
was
watching
her
closely
with
a
heart
in
that
condition
and
her
digestion
wrecked
yes
wrecked
anything
might
happen
libbard
does
take
so
gloomy
a
view
of
poor
emily
health
hutton
held
open
the
gate
that
led
from
the
garden
into
the
drive
miss
spence
car
was
standing
by
the
front
door
libbard
is
only
a
country
doctor
you
ought
to
see
a
specialist
he
could
not
refrain
from
laughing
you
have
a
macabre
passion
for
specialists
miss
spence
held
up
her
hand
in
protest
i
am
serious
i
think
poor
emily
is
in
a
very
bad
state
anything
might
happen
at
any
moment
he
handed
her
into
the
car
and
shut
the
door
the
chauffeur
started
the
engine
and
climbed
into
his
place
ready
to
drive
off
shall
i
tell
him
to
start
he
had
no
desire
to
continue
the
conversation
miss
spence
leaned
forward
and
shot
a
gioconda
in
his
direction
remember
i
expect
you
to
come
and
see
me
again
soon
mechanically
he
grinned
made
a
polite
noise
and
as
the
car
moved
forward
waved
his
hand
he
was
happy
to
be
alone
a
few
minutes
afterwards
hutton
himself
drove
away
doris
was
waiting
at
the
they
dined
together
twenty
miles
from
home
at
a
roadside
hotel
it
was
one
of
those
bad
expensive
meals
which
are
only
cooked
in
country
hotels
frequented
by
motorists
it
revolted
hutton
but
doris
enjoyed
it
she
always
enjoyed
things
hutton
ordered
a
not
very
good
brand
of
champagne
he
was
wishing
he
had
spent
the
evening
in
his
library
when
they
started
homewards
doris
was
a
little
tipsy
and
extremely
affectionate
it
was
very
dark
inside
the
car
but
looking
forward
past
the
motionless
form
of
they
could
see
a
bright
and
narrow
universe
of
forms
and
colours
scooped
out
of
the
night
by
the
electric
it
was
after
eleven
when
hutton
reached
home
libbard
met
him
in
the
hall
he
was
a
small
man
with
delicate
hands
and
features
that
were
almost
feminine
his
brown
eyes
were
large
and
melancholy
he
used
to
waste
a
great
deal
of
time
sitting
at
the
bedside
of
his
patients
looking
sadness
through
those
eyes
and
talking
in
a
sad
low
voice
about
nothing
in
particular
his
person
exhaled
a
pleasing
odour
decidedly
antiseptic
but
at
the
same
time
suave
and
discreetly
delicious
libbard
said
hutton
in
surprise
you
here
is
my
wife
ill
we
tried
to
fetch
you
earlier
the
soft
melancholy
voice
replied
it
was
thought
you
were
at
johnson
but
they
had
no
news
of
you
there
no
i
was
detained
i
had
a
breakdown
hutton
answered
irritably
it
was
tiresome
to
be
caught
out
in
a
lie
your
wife
wanted
to
see
you
urgently
well
i
can
go
now
hutton
moved
towards
the
stairs
libbard
laid
a
hand
on
his
arm
i
am
afraid
it
too
late
too
late
he
began
fumbling
with
his
watch
it
would
come
out
of
the
pocket
hutton
passed
away
half
an
hour
ago
the
voice
remained
even
in
its
softness
the
melancholy
of
the
eyes
did
not
deepen
libbard
spoke
of
death
as
he
would
speak
of
a
local
cricket
match
all
things
were
equally
vain
and
equally
deplorable
hutton
found
himself
thinking
of
janet
spence
words
at
any
moment
at
any
moment
she
had
been
extraordinarily
right
what
happened
he
asked
what
was
the
cause
libbard
explained
it
was
heart
failure
brought
on
by
a
violent
attack
of
nausea
caused
in
its
turn
by
the
eating
of
something
of
an
irritant
nature
red
currants
hutton
suggested
very
likely
it
had
been
too
much
for
the
heart
there
was
chronic
valvular
disease
something
had
collapsed
under
the
strain
it
was
all
over
she
could
not
have
suffered
much
iii
it
a
pity
they
should
have
chosen
the
day
of
the
eton
and
harrow
match
for
the
funeral
old
general
grego
was
saying
as
he
stood
his
top
hat
in
his
hand
under
the
shadow
of
the
lych
gate
wiping
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
hutton
overheard
the
remark
and
with
difficulty
restrained
a
desire
to
inflict
grievous
bodily
pain
on
the
general
he
would
have
liked
to
hit
the
old
brute
in
the
middle
of
his
big
red
face
monstrous
great
mulberry
spotted
with
meal
was
there
no
respect
for
the
dead
did
nobody
care
in
theory
he
did
much
care
let
the
dead
bury
their
dead
but
here
at
the
graveside
he
had
found
himself
actually
sobbing
poor
emily
they
had
been
pretty
happy
once
now
she
was
lying
at
the
bottom
of
a
hole
and
here
was
grego
complaining
that
he
could
go
to
the
eton
and
harrow
match
hutton
looked
round
at
the
groups
of
black
figures
that
were
drifting
slowly
out
of
the
churchyard
towards
the
fleet
of
cabs
and
motors
assembled
in
the
road
outside
against
the
brilliant
background
of
the
july
grass
and
flowers
and
foliage
they
had
a
horribly
alien
and
unnatural
appearance
it
pleased
him
to
think
that
all
these
people
would
soon
be
dead
too
that
evening
hutton
sat
up
late
in
his
library
reading
the
life
of
milton
there
was
no
particular
reason
why
he
should
have
chosen
milton
it
was
the
book
that
first
came
to
hand
that
was
all
it
was
after
midnight
when
he
had
finished
he
got
up
from
his
armchair
unbolted
the
french
windows
and
stepped
out
on
to
the
little
paved
terrace
the
night
was
quiet
and
clear
hutton
looked
at
the
stars
and
at
the
holes
between
them
dropped
his
eyes
to
the
dim
lawns
and
hueless
flowers
of
the
garden
and
let
them
wander
over
the
farther
landscape
black
and
grey
under
the
moon
he
began
to
think
with
a
kind
of
confused
violence
there
were
the
stars
there
was
milton
a
man
can
be
somehow
the
peer
of
stars
and
night
greatness
nobility
but
is
there
seriously
a
difference
between
the
noble
and
the
ignoble
milton
the
stars
death
and
himself
himself
the
soul
the
body
the
higher
and
the
lower
nature
perhaps
there
was
something
in
it
after
all
milton
had
a
god
on
his
side
and
righteousness
what
had
he
nothing
nothing
whatever
there
were
only
doris
little
breasts
what
was
the
point
of
it
all
milton
the
stars
death
and
emily
in
her
grave
doris
and
himself
always
himself
oh
he
was
a
futile
and
disgusting
being
everything
convinced
him
of
it
it
was
a
solemn
moment
he
spoke
aloud
i
will
i
will
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
in
the
darkness
was
appalling
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
sworn
that
infernal
oath
which
binds
even
the
gods
i
will
i
will
there
had
been
new
year
days
and
solemn
anniversaries
in
the
past
when
he
had
felt
the
same
contritions
and
recorded
similar
resolutions
they
had
all
thinned
away
these
resolutions
like
smoke
into
nothingness
but
this
was
a
greater
moment
and
he
had
pronounced
a
more
fearful
oath
in
the
future
it
was
to
be
different
yes
he
would
live
by
reason
he
would
be
industrious
he
would
curb
his
appetites
he
would
devote
his
life
to
some
good
purpose
it
was
resolved
and
it
would
be
so
in
practice
he
saw
himself
spending
his
mornings
in
agricultural
pursuits
riding
round
with
the
bailiff
seeing
that
his
land
was
farmed
in
the
best
modern
way
silos
and
artificial
manures
and
continuous
cropping
and
all
that
the
remainder
of
the
day
should
be
devoted
to
serious
study
there
was
that
book
he
had
been
intending
to
write
for
so
long
effect
of
diseases
on
hutton
went
to
bed
humble
and
contrite
but
with
a
sense
that
grace
had
entered
into
him
he
slept
for
seven
and
a
half
hours
and
woke
to
find
the
sun
brilliantly
shining
the
emotions
of
the
evening
before
had
been
transformed
by
a
good
night
rest
into
his
customary
cheerfulness
it
was
not
until
a
good
many
seconds
after
his
return
to
conscious
life
that
he
remembered
his
resolution
his
stygian
oath
milton
and
death
seemed
somehow
different
in
the
sunlight
as
for
the
stars
they
were
not
there
but
the
resolutions
were
good
even
in
the
daytime
he
could
see
that
he
had
his
horse
saddled
after
breakfast
and
rode
round
the
farm
with
the
bailiff
after
luncheon
he
read
thucydides
on
the
plague
at
athens
in
the
evening
he
made
a
few
notes
on
malaria
in
southern
italy
while
he
was
undressing
he
remembered
that
there
was
a
good
anecdote
in
skelton
about
the
sweating
sickness
he
would
have
made
a
note
of
it
if
only
he
could
have
found
a
pencil
on
the
sixth
morning
of
his
new
life
hutton
found
among
his
correspondence
an
envelope
addressed
in
that
peculiarly
vulgar
handwriting
which
he
knew
to
be
doris
he
opened
it
and
began
to
read
she
did
know
what
to
say
words
were
so
inadequate
his
wife
dying
like
that
and
so
suddenly
it
was
too
terrible
hutton
sighed
but
his
interest
revived
somewhat
as
he
read
on
death
is
so
frightening
i
never
think
of
it
when
i
can
help
it
but
when
something
like
this
happens
or
when
i
am
feeling
ill
or
depressed
then
i
ca
help
remembering
it
is
there
so
close
and
i
think
about
all
the
wicked
things
i
have
done
and
about
you
and
me
and
i
wonder
what
will
happen
and
i
am
so
frightened
i
am
so
lonely
teddy
bear
and
so
unhappy
and
i
do
know
what
to
do
i
ca
get
rid
of
the
idea
of
dying
i
am
so
wretched
and
helpless
without
you
i
did
mean
to
write
to
you
i
meant
to
wait
till
you
were
out
of
mourning
and
could
come
and
see
me
again
but
i
was
so
lonely
and
miserable
teddy
bear
i
had
to
write
i
help
it
forgive
me
i
want
you
so
much
i
have
nobody
in
the
world
but
you
you
are
so
good
and
gentle
and
understanding
there
is
nobody
like
you
i
shall
never
forget
how
good
and
kind
you
have
been
to
me
and
you
are
so
clever
and
know
so
much
i
can
t
understand
how
you
ever
came
to
pay
any
attention
to
me
i
am
so
dull
and
stupid
much
less
like
me
and
love
me
because
you
do
love
me
a
little
do
you
teddy
bear
hutton
was
touched
with
shame
and
remorse
to
be
thanked
like
this
worshipped
for
having
seduced
the
girl
it
was
too
much
it
had
just
been
a
piece
of
imbecile
wantonness
imbecile
idiotic
there
was
no
other
way
to
describe
it
for
when
all
was
said
he
had
derived
very
little
pleasure
from
it
taking
all
things
together
he
had
probably
been
more
bored
than
amused
once
upon
a
time
he
had
believed
himself
to
be
a
hedonist
but
to
be
a
hedonist
implies
a
certain
process
of
reasoning
a
deliberate
choice
of
known
pleasures
a
rejection
of
known
pains
this
had
been
done
without
reason
against
it
for
he
knew
beforehand
so
well
so
well
that
there
was
no
interest
or
pleasure
to
be
derived
from
these
wretched
affairs
and
yet
each
time
the
vague
itch
came
upon
him
he
succumbed
involving
himself
once
more
in
the
old
stupidity
there
had
been
maggie
his
wife
maid
and
edith
the
girl
on
the
farm
and
pringle
and
the
waitress
in
london
and
others
there
seemed
to
be
dozens
of
them
it
had
all
been
so
stale
and
boring
he
knew
it
would
be
he
always
knew
and
yet
and
yet
experience
does
teach
poor
little
doris
he
would
write
to
her
kindly
comfortingly
but
he
would
see
her
again
a
servant
came
to
tell
him
that
his
horse
was
saddled
and
waiting
he
mounted
and
rode
off
that
morning
the
old
bailiff
was
more
irritating
than
usual
five
days
later
doris
and
hutton
ware
sitting
together
on
the
pier
at
southend
doris
in
white
muslin
with
pink
garnishings
radiated
happiness
hutton
legs
outstretched
and
chair
tilted
had
pushed
the
panama
back
from
his
forehead
and
was
trying
to
feel
like
a
tripper
that
night
when
doris
was
asleep
breathing
and
warm
by
his
side
he
recaptured
in
this
moment
of
darkness
and
physical
fatigue
the
rather
cosmic
emotion
which
had
possessed
him
that
evening
not
a
fortnight
ago
when
he
had
made
his
great
resolution
and
so
his
solemn
oath
had
already
gone
the
way
of
so
many
other
resolutions
unreason
had
triumphed
at
the
first
itch
of
desire
he
had
given
way
he
was
hopeless
hopeless
for
a
long
time
he
lay
with
closed
eyes
ruminating
his
humiliation
the
girl
stirred
in
her
sleep
hutton
turned
over
and
looked
in
her
direction
enough
faint
light
crept
in
between
the
curtains
to
show
her
bare
arm
and
shoulder
her
neck
and
the
dark
tangle
of
hair
on
the
pillow
she
was
beautiful
desirable
why
did
he
lie
there
moaning
over
his
sins
what
did
it
matter
if
he
were
hopeless
then
so
be
it
he
would
make
the
best
of
his
hopelessness
a
glorious
sense
of
irresponsibility
suddenly
filled
him
he
was
free
magnificently
free
in
a
kind
of
exaltation
he
drew
the
girl
towards
him
she
woke
bewildered
almost
frightened
under
his
rough
kisses
the
storm
of
his
desire
subsided
into
a
kind
of
serene
merriment
the
whole
atmosphere
seemed
to
be
quivering
with
enormous
silent
laughter
could
anyone
love
you
as
much
as
i
do
teddy
bear
the
question
came
faintly
from
distant
worlds
of
love
i
think
i
know
somebody
who
does
hutton
replied
the
submarine
laughter
was
swelling
rising
ready
to
break
the
surface
of
silence
and
resound
who
tell
me
what
do
you
mean
the
voice
had
come
very
close
charged
with
suspicion
anguish
indignation
it
belonged
to
this
immediate
world
a
ah
who
you
never
guess
hutton
kept
up
the
joke
until
it
began
to
grow
tedious
and
then
pronounced
the
name
janet
spence
doris
was
incredulous
miss
spence
of
the
manor
that
old
woman
it
was
too
ridiculous
hutton
laughed
too
but
it
quite
true
he
said
she
adores
me
oh
the
vast
joke
he
would
go
and
see
her
as
soon
as
he
returned
see
and
conquer
i
believe
she
wants
to
marry
me
he
added
but
you
would
you
do
intend
the
air
was
fairly
crepitating
with
humour
hutton
laughed
aloud
i
intend
to
marry
you
he
said
it
seemed
to
him
the
best
joke
he
had
ever
made
in
his
life
when
hutton
left
southend
he
was
once
more
a
married
man
it
was
agreed
that
for
the
time
being
the
fact
should
be
kept
secret
in
the
autumn
they
would
go
abroad
together
and
the
world
should
be
informed
meanwhile
he
was
to
go
back
to
his
own
house
and
doris
to
hers
the
day
after
his
return
he
walked
over
in
the
afternoon
to
see
miss
spence
she
received
him
with
the
old
gioconda
i
was
expecting
you
to
come
i
could
keep
away
hutton
gallantly
replied
they
sat
in
the
it
was
a
pleasant
place
a
little
old
stucco
temple
bowered
among
dense
bushes
of
evergreen
miss
spence
had
left
her
mark
on
it
by
hanging
up
over
the
seat
a
della
robbia
plaque
i
am
thinking
of
going
to
italy
this
autumn
said
hutton
he
felt
like
a
bottle
ready
to
pop
with
bubbling
humorous
excitement
italy
miss
spence
closed
her
eyes
ecstatically
i
feel
drawn
there
too
why
not
let
yourself
be
drawn
i
do
know
one
somehow
has
the
energy
and
initiative
to
set
out
alone
alone
ah
sound
of
guitars
and
throaty
singing
yes
travelling
alone
is
much
fun
miss
spence
lay
back
in
her
chair
without
speaking
her
eyes
were
still
closed
hutton
stroked
his
moustache
the
silence
prolonged
itself
for
what
seemed
a
very
long
time
pressed
to
stay
to
dinner
hutton
did
not
refuse
the
fun
had
hardly
started
the
table
was
laid
in
the
loggia
through
its
arches
they
looked
out
on
to
the
sloping
garden
to
the
valley
below
and
the
farther
hills
light
ebbed
away
the
heat
and
silence
were
oppressive
a
huge
cloud
was
mounting
up
the
sky
and
there
were
distant
breathings
of
thunder
the
thunder
drew
nearer
a
wind
began
to
blow
and
the
first
drops
of
rain
fell
the
table
was
cleared
miss
spence
and
hutton
sat
on
in
the
growing
darkness
miss
spence
broke
a
long
silence
by
saying
meditatively
i
think
everyone
has
a
right
to
a
certain
amount
of
happiness
you
most
certainly
but
what
was
she
leading
up
to
nobody
makes
generalisations
about
life
unless
they
mean
to
talk
about
themselves
happiness
he
looked
back
on
his
own
life
and
saw
a
cheerful
placid
existence
disturbed
by
no
great
griefs
or
discomforts
or
alarms
he
had
always
had
money
and
freedom
he
had
been
able
to
do
very
much
as
he
wanted
yes
he
supposed
he
had
been
happy
happier
than
most
men
and
now
he
was
not
merely
happy
he
had
discovered
in
irresponsibility
the
secret
of
gaiety
he
was
about
to
say
something
about
his
happiness
when
miss
spence
went
on
speaking
people
like
you
and
me
have
a
right
to
be
happy
some
time
in
our
lives
me
said
hutton
surprised
poor
henry
fate
has
treated
either
of
us
very
well
oh
well
it
might
have
treated
me
worse
you
re
being
cheerful
that
brave
of
you
but
do
think
i
ca
see
behind
the
mask
miss
spence
spoke
louder
and
louder
as
the
rain
came
down
more
and
more
heavily
periodically
the
thunder
cut
across
her
utterances
she
talked
on
shouting
against
the
noise
i
have
understood
you
so
well
and
for
so
long
a
flash
revealed
her
aimed
and
intent
leaning
towards
him
her
eyes
were
two
profound
and
menacing
the
darkness
her
you
were
a
lonely
soul
seeking
a
companion
soul
i
could
sympathise
with
you
in
your
solitude
your
marriage
the
thunder
cut
short
the
sentence
miss
spence
voice
became
audible
once
more
with
the
words
could
offer
no
companionship
to
a
man
of
your
stamp
you
needed
a
soul
mate
a
soul
mate
he
a
soul
mate
it
was
incredibly
fantastic
georgette
leblanc
the
mate
of
maurice
maeterlinck
he
had
seen
that
in
the
paper
a
few
days
ago
so
it
was
thus
that
janet
spence
had
painted
him
in
her
imagination
a
and
for
doris
he
was
a
picture
of
goodness
and
the
cleverest
man
in
the
world
and
actually
really
he
was
what
who
knows
my
heart
went
out
to
you
i
could
understand
i
was
lonely
too
miss
spence
laid
her
hand
on
his
knee
you
were
so
patient
another
flash
she
was
still
aimed
dangerously
you
never
complained
but
i
could
guess
i
could
guess
how
wonderful
of
you
so
he
was
an
only
a
woman
intuition
the
thunder
crashed
and
rumbled
died
away
and
only
the
sound
of
the
ram
was
left
the
thunder
was
his
laughter
magnified
externalised
flash
and
crash
there
it
was
again
right
on
top
of
them
do
you
feel
that
you
have
within
you
something
that
is
akin
to
this
storm
he
could
imagine
her
leaning
forward
as
she
uttered
the
words
passion
makes
one
the
equal
of
the
elements
what
was
his
gambit
now
why
obviously
he
should
have
said
yes
and
ventured
on
some
unequivocal
gesture
but
hutton
suddenly
took
fright
the
ginger
beer
in
him
had
gone
flat
the
woman
was
serious
terribly
serious
he
was
appalled
passion
no
he
desperately
answered
i
am
without
passion
but
his
remark
was
either
unheard
or
unheeded
for
miss
spence
went
on
with
a
growing
exaltation
speaking
so
rapidly
however
and
in
such
a
burningly
intimate
whisper
that
hutton
found
it
very
difficult
to
distinguish
what
she
was
saying
she
was
telling
him
as
far
as
he
could
make
out
the
story
of
her
life
the
lightning
was
less
frequent
now
and
there
were
long
intervals
of
darkness
but
at
each
flash
he
saw
her
still
aiming
towards
him
still
yearning
forward
with
a
terrifying
intensity
darkness
the
rain
and
then
flash
her
face
was
there
close
at
hand
a
pale
mask
greenish
white
the
large
eyes
the
narrow
barrel
of
the
mouth
the
heavy
eyebrows
agrippina
or
was
it
rather
yes
was
it
rather
george
robey
he
began
devising
absurd
plans
for
escaping
he
might
suddenly
jump
up
pretending
he
had
seen
a
burglar
stop
thief
stop
thief
and
dash
off
into
the
night
in
pursuit
or
should
he
say
that
he
felt
faint
a
heart
attack
or
that
he
had
seen
a
ghost
emily
ghost
in
the
garden
absorbed
in
his
childish
plotting
he
had
ceased
to
pay
any
attention
to
miss
spence
words
the
spasmodic
clutching
of
her
hand
recalled
his
thoughts
i
honoured
you
for
that
henry
she
was
saying
honoured
him
for
what
marriage
is
a
sacred
tie
and
your
respect
for
it
even
when
the
marriage
was
as
it
was
in
your
case
an
unhappy
one
made
me
respect
you
and
admire
you
and
shall
i
dare
say
the
word
oh
the
burglar
the
ghost
in
the
garden
but
it
was
too
late
yes
love
you
henry
all
the
more
but
we
free
now
henry
free
there
was
a
movement
in
the
dark
and
she
was
kneeling
on
the
floor
by
his
chair
oh
henry
henry
i
have
been
unhappy
too
her
arms
embraced
him
and
by
the
shaking
of
her
body
he
could
feel
that
she
was
sobbing
she
might
have
been
a
suppliant
crying
for
mercy
you
must
janet
he
protested
those
tears
were
terrible
terrible
not
now
not
now
you
must
be
calm
you
must
go
to
bed
he
patted
her
shoulder
then
got
up
disengaging
himself
from
her
embrace
he
left
her
still
crouching
on
the
floor
beside
the
chair
on
which
he
had
been
sitting
groping
his
way
into
the
hall
and
without
waiting
to
look
for
his
hat
he
went
out
of
the
house
taking
infinite
pains
to
close
the
front
door
noiselessly
behind
him
the
clouds
had
blown
over
and
the
moon
was
shining
from
a
clear
sky
there
were
puddles
all
along
the
road
and
a
noise
of
running
water
rose
from
the
gutters
and
ditches
hutton
splashed
along
not
caring
if
he
got
wet
how
heartrendingly
she
had
sobbed
with
the
emotions
of
pity
and
remorse
that
the
recollection
evoked
in
him
there
was
a
certain
resentment
why
could
she
have
played
the
game
that
he
was
playing
the
heartless
amusing
game
yes
but
he
had
known
all
the
time
that
she
would
she
could
play
that
game
he
had
known
and
persisted
what
had
she
said
about
passion
and
the
elements
something
absurdly
stale
but
true
true
there
she
was
a
cloud
black
bosomed
and
charged
with
thunder
and
he
like
some
absurd
little
benjamin
franklin
had
sent
up
a
kite
into
the
heart
of
the
menace
now
he
was
complaining
that
his
toy
had
drawn
the
lightning
she
was
probably
still
kneeling
by
that
chair
in
the
loggia
crying
but
why
had
he
been
able
to
keep
up
the
game
why
had
his
irresponsibility
deserted
him
leaving
him
suddenly
sober
in
a
cold
world
there
were
no
answers
to
any
of
his
questions
one
idea
burned
steady
and
luminous
in
his
mind
the
idea
of
flight
he
must
get
away
at
once
iv
what
are
you
thinking
about
teddy
bear
nothing
there
was
a
silence
hutton
remained
motionless
his
elbows
on
the
parapet
of
the
terrace
his
chin
in
his
hands
looking
down
over
florence
he
had
taken
a
villa
on
one
of
the
hilltops
to
the
south
of
the
city
from
a
little
raised
terrace
at
the
end
of
the
garden
one
looked
down
a
long
fertile
valley
on
to
the
town
and
beyond
it
to
the
bleak
mass
of
monte
morello
and
eastward
of
it
to
the
peopled
hill
of
fiesole
dotted
with
white
houses
everything
was
clear
and
luminous
in
the
september
sunshine
are
you
worried
about
anything
no
thank
you
tell
me
teddy
bear
but
my
dear
there
nothing
to
tell
hutton
turned
round
smiled
and
patted
the
girl
hand
i
think
you
better
go
in
and
have
your
siesta
it
too
hot
for
you
here
very
well
teddy
bear
are
you
coming
too
when
i
finished
my
cigar
all
right
but
do
hurry
up
and
finish
it
teddy
bear
slowly
reluctantly
she
descended
the
steps
of
the
terrace
and
walked
towards
the
house
hutton
continued
his
contemplation
of
florence
he
had
need
to
be
alone
it
was
good
sometimes
to
escape
from
doris
and
the
restless
solicitude
of
her
passion
he
had
never
known
the
pains
of
loving
hopelessly
but
he
was
experiencing
now
the
pains
of
being
loved
these
last
weeks
had
been
a
period
of
growing
discomfort
doris
was
always
with
him
like
an
obsession
like
a
guilty
conscience
yes
it
was
good
to
be
alone
he
pulled
an
envelope
out
of
his
pocket
and
opened
it
not
without
reluctance
he
hated
letters
they
always
contained
something
unpleasant
nowadays
since
his
second
marriage
this
was
from
his
sister
he
began
skimming
through
the
insulting
of
which
it
was
composed
the
words
indecent
haste
social
suicide
scarcely
cold
in
her
grave
person
of
the
lower
classes
all
occurred
they
were
inevitable
now
in
any
communication
from
a
and
relative
impatient
he
was
about
to
tear
the
stupid
letter
to
pieces
when
his
eye
fell
on
a
sentence
at
the
bottom
of
the
third
page
his
heart
beat
with
uncomfortable
violence
as
he
read
it
it
was
too
monstrous
janet
spence
was
going
about
telling
everyone
that
he
had
poisoned
his
wife
in
order
to
marry
doris
what
damnable
malice
ordinarily
a
man
of
the
suavest
temper
hutton
found
himself
trembling
with
rage
he
took
the
childish
satisfaction
of
calling
names
he
cursed
the
woman
then
suddenly
he
saw
the
ridiculous
side
of
the
situation
the
notion
that
he
should
have
murdered
anyone
in
order
to
marry
doris
if
they
only
knew
how
miserably
bored
he
was
poor
dear
janet
she
had
tried
to
be
malicious
she
had
only
succeeded
in
being
stupid
a
sound
of
footsteps
aroused
him
he
looked
round
in
the
garden
below
the
little
terrace
the
servant
girl
of
the
house
was
picking
fruit
a
neapolitan
strayed
somehow
as
far
north
as
florence
she
was
a
specimen
of
the
classical
type
a
little
debased
her
profile
might
have
been
taken
from
a
sicilian
coin
of
a
bad
period
her
features
carved
floridly
in
the
grand
tradition
expressed
an
almost
perfect
stupidity
her
mouth
was
the
most
beautiful
thing
about
her
the
calligraphic
hand
of
nature
had
richly
curved
it
into
an
expression
of
mulish
bad
temper
under
her
hideous
black
clothes
hutton
divined
a
powerful
body
firm
and
massive
he
had
looked
at
her
before
with
a
vague
interest
and
curiosity
the
curiosity
defined
and
focused
itself
into
a
desire
an
idyll
of
theocritus
here
was
the
woman
he
alas
was
not
precisely
like
a
goatherd
on
the
volcanic
hills
he
called
to
her
armida
the
smile
with
which
she
answered
him
was
so
provocative
attested
so
easy
a
virtue
that
hutton
took
fright
he
was
on
the
brink
once
more
on
the
brink
he
must
draw
back
oh
quickly
quickly
before
it
was
too
late
the
girl
continued
to
look
up
at
him
she
asked
at
last
stupidity
or
reason
oh
there
was
no
choice
now
it
was
imbecility
every
time
he
called
back
to
her
twelve
steps
led
from
the
garden
to
the
terrace
hutton
counted
them
down
down
down
down
he
saw
a
vision
of
himself
descending
from
one
circle
of
the
inferno
to
the
next
from
a
darkness
full
of
wind
and
hail
to
an
abyss
of
stinking
mud
v
for
a
good
many
days
the
hutton
case
had
a
place
on
the
front
page
of
every
newspaper
there
had
been
no
more
popular
murder
trial
since
george
smith
had
temporarily
eclipsed
the
european
war
by
drowning
in
a
warm
bath
his
seventh
bride
the
public
imagination
was
stirred
by
this
tale
of
a
murder
brought
to
light
months
after
the
date
of
the
crime
here
it
was
felt
was
one
of
those
incidents
in
human
life
so
notable
because
they
are
so
rare
which
do
definitely
justify
the
ways
of
god
to
man
a
wicked
man
had
been
moved
by
an
illicit
passion
to
kill
his
wife
for
months
he
had
lived
in
sin
and
fancied
security
only
to
be
dashed
at
last
more
horribly
into
the
pit
he
had
prepared
for
himself
murder
will
out
and
here
was
a
case
of
it
the
readers
of
the
newspapers
were
in
a
position
to
follow
every
movement
of
the
hand
of
god
there
had
been
vague
but
persistent
rumours
in
the
neighbourhood
the
police
had
taken
action
at
last
then
came
the
exhumation
order
the
examination
the
inquest
the
evidence
of
the
experts
the
verdict
of
the
coroner
jury
the
trial
the
condemnation
for
once
providence
had
done
its
duty
obviously
grossly
didactically
as
in
a
melodrama
the
newspapers
were
right
in
making
of
the
case
the
staple
intellectual
food
of
a
whole
season
hutton
first
emotion
when
he
was
summoned
from
italy
to
give
evidence
at
the
inquest
was
one
of
indignation
it
was
a
monstrous
a
scandalous
thing
that
the
police
should
take
such
idle
malicious
gossip
seriously
when
the
inquest
was
over
he
would
bring
an
action
for
malicious
prosecution
against
the
chief
constable
he
would
sue
the
spence
woman
for
slander
the
inquest
was
opened
the
astonishing
evidence
unrolled
itself
the
experts
had
examined
the
body
and
had
found
traces
of
arsenic
they
were
of
opinion
that
the
late
hutton
had
died
of
arsenic
poisoning
arsenic
poisoning
emily
had
died
of
arsenic
poisoning
after
that
hutton
learned
with
surprise
that
there
was
enough
arsenicated
insecticide
in
his
to
poison
an
army
it
was
now
quite
suddenly
that
he
saw
it
there
was
a
case
against
him
fascinated
he
watched
it
growing
growing
like
some
monstrous
tropical
plant
it
was
enveloping
him
surrounding
him
he
was
lost
in
a
tangled
forest
when
was
the
poison
administered
the
experts
agreed
that
it
must
have
been
swallowed
eight
or
nine
hours
before
death
about
yes
about
clara
the
was
called
hutton
she
remembered
had
asked
her
to
go
and
fetch
her
medicine
hutton
had
volunteered
to
go
instead
he
had
gone
alone
miss
spence
ah
the
memory
of
the
storm
the
white
aimed
face
the
horror
of
it
all
miss
spence
confirmed
clara
statement
and
added
that
hutton
had
come
back
with
the
medicine
already
poured
out
in
a
wineglass
not
in
the
bottle
hutton
indignation
evaporated
he
was
dismayed
frightened
it
was
all
too
fantastic
to
be
taken
seriously
and
yet
this
nightmare
was
a
fact
it
was
actually
happening
had
seen
them
kissing
often
he
had
taken
them
for
a
drive
on
the
day
of
hutton
death
he
could
see
them
reflected
in
the
sometimes
out
of
the
tail
of
his
eye
the
inquest
was
adjourned
that
evening
doris
went
to
bed
with
a
headache
when
he
went
to
her
room
after
dinner
hutton
found
her
crying
what
the
matter
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
her
bed
and
began
to
stroke
her
hair
for
a
long
time
she
did
not
answer
and
he
went
on
stroking
her
hair
mechanically
almost
unconsciously
sometimes
even
he
bent
down
and
kissed
her
bare
shoulder
he
had
his
own
affairs
however
to
think
about
what
had
happened
how
was
it
that
the
stupid
gossip
had
actually
come
true
emily
had
died
of
arsenic
poisoning
it
was
absurd
impossible
the
order
of
things
had
been
broken
and
he
was
at
the
mercy
of
an
irresponsibility
what
had
happened
what
was
going
to
happen
he
was
interrupted
in
the
midst
of
his
thoughts
it
my
fault
it
my
fault
doris
suddenly
sobbed
out
i
have
loved
you
i
ought
to
have
let
you
love
me
why
was
i
ever
born
hutton
did
say
anything
but
looked
down
in
silence
at
the
abject
figure
of
misery
lying
on
the
bed
if
they
do
anything
to
you
i
shall
kill
myself
she
sat
up
held
him
for
a
moment
at
arm
length
and
looked
at
him
with
a
kind
of
violence
as
though
she
were
never
to
see
him
again
i
love
you
i
love
you
i
love
you
she
drew
him
inert
and
passive
towards
her
clasped
him
pressed
herself
against
him
i
did
know
you
loved
me
as
much
as
that
teddy
bear
but
why
did
you
do
it
why
did
you
do
it
hutton
undid
her
clasping
arms
and
got
up
his
face
became
very
red
you
seem
to
take
it
for
granted
that
i
murdered
my
wife
he
said
it
really
too
grotesque
what
do
you
all
take
me
for
a
cinema
hero
he
had
begun
to
lose
his
temper
all
the
exasperation
all
the
fear
and
bewilderment
of
the
day
was
transformed
into
a
violent
anger
against
her
it
all
such
damned
stupidity
have
you
any
conception
of
a
civilised
man
mentality
do
i
look
the
sort
of
man
who
go
about
slaughtering
people
i
suppose
you
imagined
i
was
so
insanely
in
love
with
you
that
i
could
commit
any
folly
when
will
you
women
understand
that
one
is
insanely
in
love
all
one
asks
for
is
a
quiet
life
which
you
wo
allow
one
to
have
i
do
know
what
the
devil
ever
induced
me
to
marry
you
it
was
all
a
damned
stupid
practical
joke
and
now
you
go
about
saying
i
a
murderer
i
wo
stand
it
hutton
stamped
towards
the
door
he
had
said
horrible
things
he
knew
odious
things
that
he
ought
speedily
to
unsay
but
he
would
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
teddy
bear
he
turned
the
handle
the
latch
clicked
into
place
teddy
bear
the
voice
that
came
to
him
through
the
closed
door
was
agonised
should
he
go
back
he
ought
to
go
back
he
touched
the
handle
then
withdrew
his
fingers
and
quickly
walked
away
when
he
was
down
the
stairs
he
halted
she
might
try
to
do
something
silly
throw
herself
out
of
the
window
or
god
knows
what
he
listened
attentively
there
was
no
sound
but
he
pictured
her
very
clearly
tiptoeing
across
the
room
lifting
the
sash
as
high
as
it
would
go
leaning
out
into
the
cold
night
air
it
was
raining
a
little
under
the
window
lay
the
paved
terrace
how
far
below
or
thirty
feet
once
when
he
was
walking
along
piccadilly
a
dog
had
jumped
out
of
a
window
of
the
ritz
he
had
seen
it
fall
he
had
heard
it
strike
the
pavement
should
he
go
back
he
was
damned
if
he
would
he
hated
her
he
sat
for
a
long
time
in
the
library
what
had
happened
what
was
happening
he
turned
the
question
over
and
over
in
his
mind
and
could
find
no
answer
suppose
the
nightmare
dreamed
itself
out
to
its
horrible
conclusion
death
was
waiting
for
him
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
he
wanted
so
passionately
to
live
just
to
be
alive
poor
emily
had
wished
it
too
he
remembered
just
to
be
alive
there
were
still
so
many
places
in
this
astonishing
world
unvisited
so
many
queer
delightful
people
still
unknown
so
many
lovely
women
never
so
much
as
seen
the
huge
white
oxen
would
still
be
dragging
their
wains
along
the
tuscan
roads
the
cypresses
would
still
go
up
straight
as
pillars
to
the
blue
heaven
but
he
would
not
be
there
to
see
them
and
the
sweet
southern
wines
tear
of
christ
and
blood
of
judas
others
would
drink
them
not
he
others
would
walk
down
the
obscure
and
narrow
lanes
between
the
bookshelves
in
the
london
library
sniffing
the
dusty
perfume
of
good
literature
peering
at
strange
titles
discovering
unknown
names
exploring
the
fringes
of
vast
domains
of
knowledge
he
would
be
lying
in
a
hole
in
the
ground
and
why
why
confusedly
he
felt
that
some
extraordinary
kind
of
justice
was
being
done
in
the
past
he
had
been
wanton
and
imbecile
and
irresponsible
now
fate
was
playing
as
wantonly
as
irresponsibly
with
him
it
was
tit
for
tat
and
god
existed
after
all
he
felt
that
he
would
like
to
pray
forty
years
ago
he
used
to
kneel
by
his
bed
every
evening
the
nightly
formula
of
his
childhood
came
to
him
almost
unsought
from
some
long
unopened
chamber
of
the
memory
god
bless
father
and
mother
tom
and
cissie
and
the
baby
mademoiselle
and
nurse
and
everyone
that
i
love
and
make
me
a
good
boy
amen
they
were
all
dead
now
all
except
cissie
his
mind
seemed
to
soften
and
dissolve
a
great
calm
descended
upon
his
spirit
he
went
upstairs
to
ask
doris
forgiveness
he
found
her
lying
on
the
couch
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
on
the
floor
beside
her
stood
a
blue
bottle
of
liniment
marked
not
to
be
taken
she
seemed
to
have
drunk
about
half
of
it
you
did
love
me
was
all
she
said
when
she
opened
her
eyes
to
find
him
bending
over
her
libbard
arrived
in
time
to
prevent
any
very
serious
consequences
you
must
do
this
again
he
said
while
hutton
was
out
of
the
room
what
to
prevent
me
she
asked
defiantly
libbard
looked
at
her
with
his
large
sad
eyes
there
nothing
to
prevent
you
he
said
only
yourself
and
your
baby
is
it
rather
bad
luck
on
your
baby
not
allowing
it
to
come
into
the
world
because
you
want
to
go
out
of
it
doris
was
silent
for
a
time
all
right
she
whispered
i
wo
hutton
sat
by
her
bedside
for
the
rest
of
the
night
he
felt
himself
now
to
be
indeed
a
murderer
for
a
time
he
persuaded
himself
that
he
loved
this
pitiable
child
dozing
in
his
chair
he
woke
up
stiff
and
cold
to
find
himself
drained
dry
as
it
were
of
every
emotion
he
had
become
nothing
but
a
tired
and
suffering
carcase
at
six
he
undressed
and
went
to
bed
for
a
couple
of
hours
sleep
in
the
course
of
the
same
afternoon
the
coroner
jury
brought
in
a
verdict
of
wilful
murder
and
hutton
was
committed
for
trial
vi
miss
spence
was
not
at
all
well
she
had
found
her
public
appearances
in
the
very
trying
and
when
it
was
all
over
she
had
something
that
was
very
nearly
a
breakdown
she
slept
badly
and
suffered
from
nervous
indigestion
libbard
used
to
call
every
other
day
she
talked
to
him
a
great
deal
mostly
about
the
hutton
case
her
moral
indignation
was
always
on
the
boil
was
it
appalling
to
think
that
one
had
had
a
murderer
in
one
house
was
it
extraordinary
that
one
could
have
been
for
so
long
mistaken
about
the
man
character
but
she
had
had
an
inkling
from
the
first
and
then
the
girl
he
had
gone
off
with
so
low
class
so

that
the

hutton
was
expecting
a
baby
the
posthumous
child
of
a
condemned
and
executed
criminal
revolted
her
the
thing
was
shocking
an
obscenity
libbard
answered
her
gently
and
vaguely
and
prescribed
bromide
one
morning
he
interrupted
her
in
the
midst
of
her
customary
tirade
by
the
way
he
said
in
his
soft
melancholy
voice
i
suppose
it
was
really
you
who
poisoned
mrs
hutton
miss
spence
stared
at
him
for
two
or
three
seconds
with
enormous
eyes
and
then
quietly
said
yes
after
that
she
started
to
cry
in
the
coffee
i
suppose
she
seemed
to
nod
assent

wafted
up
from

respectfully
sympathetic
at
his
alberto
a
little
man
with
large
lustrous
eyes
and
a
black
moustache
about
years
of

has
the
pathetic
charm
of
an
italian
with
an
organ
almost
as
pretty
and
sentimental
as
murillo

florid
gesture
with
his
right

with

you
i
am
in

been

by
intelligent

as
remarkable
how
far
they
are

nobody

of

himself
is
certain
they
may
be
merely
the
ingenious
products
of
a
very
cultured
and
elaborate
brain
mere
curiosities
who
knows

his
ingenuity

middle
western
amy
been
a
wonderful
day
has
it
dolphin
as
though
roused
from
profoundest
yes
yes
it
has
amy
you
do
often
get
it
as
fine
as
this
in
england
i
guess
dolphin
not
often
amy
nor
do
we
over
at
home
dolphin
so
i
should
suppose
a
spasm
of
anguish
dolphin
then
he
reassumes
the
old
thinker
amy
at
him
for
a
little
longer
then
unable
to
suppress
her
growing
curiosity
she
says
with
a
sudden
burst
of
childish
confidence
amy
it
must
be
wonderful
to
be
able
to
think
as
hard
as
you
do
dolphin
or
are
you
sad
about
something
dolphin
up
smiles
and
blushes
a
spell
has
been
the
finger
at
the
temple
miss
toomis
is
not
the
barrel
of
a
revolver
amy
that
means
you
not
specially
sad
about
anything
just
thinking
dolphin
just
thinking
amy
what
about
dolphin
oh
just
life
you
know
life
and
letters
amy
letters
do
you
mean
love
letters
dolphin
no
no
letters
in
the
sense
of
literature
letters
as
opposed
to
life
amy
oh
literature
they
used
to
teach
us
literature
at
school
but
i
could
never
understand
emerson
what
do
you
think
about
literature
for
dolphin
it
interests
me
you
know
i
read
it
i
even
try
to
write
it
amy
much
what
are
you
a
writer
a
poet
dolphin
dolphin
alas
it
is
only
too
true
i
am
amy
but
what
do
you
write
dolphin
verse
and
prose
miss
toomis
just
verse
and
prose
amy
is
that
interesting
i
never
met
a
poet
before
you
know
dolphin
fortunate
being
why
before
i
left
england
i
attended
a
luncheon
of
the
poetry
union
at
which
no
less
than
a
hundred
and
poets
were
present
the
sight
of
them
made
me
decide
to
go
to
italy
amy
will
you
show
me
your
books
dolphin
certainly
not
miss
toomis
that
would
ruin
our
friendship
i
am
insufferable
in
my
writings
in
them
i
give
vent
to
all
the
horrible
thoughts
and
impulses
which
i
am
too
timid
to
express
or
put
into
practice
in
real
life
take
me
as
you
find
me
here
a
decent
specimen
of
a
man
shy
but
able
to
talk
intelligently
when
the
layers
of
ice
are
broken
aimless
ineffective
but
on
the
whole
quite
a
good
sort
amy
but
i
know
that
man
already
dolphin
i
want
to
know
the
poet
tell
me
what
the
poet
is
like
dolphin
he
is
older
miss
toomis
than
the
rocks
on
which
he
sits
he
is
villainous
he
is
but
there
i
really
must
stop
it
was
you
who
set
me
going
though
did
you
do
it
on
purpose
amy
do
what
on
purpose
dolphin
make
me
talk
about
myself
if
you
want
to
get
people
to
like
you
you
must
always
lead
the
conversation
on
to
the
subject
of
their
characters
nothing
pleases
them
so
much
they
talk
with
enthusiasm
for
hours
and
go
away
saying
that
you
the
most
charming
cleverest
person
they
ever
met
but
of
course
you
knew
that
already
you
re
machiavellian
amy
machiavellian
you
the
first
person
that
ever
said
that
i
always
thought
i
was
very
simple
and
people
say
about
me
that
ah
now
talking
about
myself
that
was
unscrupulous
of
you
but
you
should
have
told
me
about
the
trick
if
you
wanted
it
to
succeed
dolphin
yes
it
was
silly
of
me
if
i
had
you
have
gone
on
talking
about
yourself
and
thought
me
the
nicest
man
in
the
world
amy
i
want
to
hear
about
your
poetry
are
you
writing
any
now

treat
you
badly
then
waiter
like
a
dog
signorina
lucrezia
ah
i
should
like
to
see
your
mother
i
should
like
to
ask
her
to
give
me
some
hints
on
how
to
bring
up
children
waiter
but
surely
signorina
you
are
not
expecting
you
ah
lucrezia
only
figuratively
giuseppe
my
children
are
spiritual
children
waiter
precisely
precisely
my
mother
alas
is
not
a
spiritual
relation
nor
is
my
fiançée
lucrezia
i
did
know
you
were
engaged
waiter
to
an
angel
of
perdition
believe
me
signorina
i
go
to
my
destruction
in
that
woman
go
with
open
eyes
there
is
no
escape
she
is
what
is
called
in
the
holy
bible
a
fisher
of
men
lucrezia
you
have
remarkable
connections
giuseppe
waiter
i
am
honoured
by
your
words
signorina
but
the
coffee
becomes
cold
hurries
out
to
the
lucrezia
in
the
garden
by
the
fountain
and
there
the
nightingale
beginning
to
sing
in
earnest
good
heavens
what
may
not
already
have
happened
runs
out
after
the
persons
emerge
from
the
the
vicomte
de
barbazange
baroness
koch
de
worms
paul
de
barbazange
a
young
man
perhaps
of
exquisite
grace
five
foot
ten
well
built
dark
hair
sleek
as
marble
the
most
refined
aristocratic
features
and
a
simone
de
worms
forty
a
ripe
semitic
beauty
five
years
more
and
the
bursting
point
of
overripeness
will
have
been
reached
but
now
thanks
to
massage
powerful
corsets
skin
foods
and
powder
she
is
still
a
beauty
a
beauty
of
the
type
italians
admire
cushioned
paul
has
a
faultless
taste
in
and
women
and
is
by
instinct
and
upbringing
an
ardent
finds
her
infinitely
repulsive
the
baronne
enters
with
a
loud
shrill
giggle
she
paul
slap
with
her
green
feather
simone
oh
you
naughty
boy
quelle
histoire
mon
dieu
how
dare
you
tell
me
such
a
story
paul
for
you
baronne
i
would
risk
anything
even
your
displeasure
simone
charming
boy
but
stories
of
that
kind
and
you
look
so
innocent
too
do
you
know
any
more
like
it
paul
not
of
that
description
but
i
will
tell
you
a
story
of
another
kind
a
true
story
a
tragic
story
simone
did
i
ever
tell
you
how
i
saw
a
woman
run
over
by
a
train
cut
to
pieces
literally
to
pieces
so
disagreeable
i
tell
you
later
but
now
what
about
your
story
paul
oh
it
nothing
nothing
simone
but
you
promised
to
tell
it
me
paul
it
only
a
commonplace
anecdote
a
young
man
poor
but
noble
with
a
name
and
a
position
to
keep
up
a
few
youthful
follies
a
mountain
of
debts
and
no
way
out
except
the
revolver
this
is
all
dull
and
obvious
enough
but
now
follows
the
interesting
part
of
the
story
he
is
about
to
take
that
way
out
when
he
meets
the
woman
of
his
dreams
the
goddess
the
angel
the
ideal
he
loves
and
he
must
die
without
a
word
turns
his
face
away
from
the
baronne
as
though
his
emotion
were
too
much
for
him
which
indeed
it
simone
vicomte
paul
this
young
man
is
you
paul
he
is
simone
and
the
woman
paul
oh
i
ca
i
may
tell
you
simone
the
woman
tell
me
paul
paul
towards
her
and
falling
on
his
the
woman
simone
is
you
ah
but
i
had
no
right
to
say
it
simone
with
my
paul
clasps
his
head
to
her
bosom
a
grimace
of
disgust
contorts
paul
classical
features
he
endures
simone
caresses
with
a
stoical
but
what
is
this
about
a
revolver
that
is
only
a
joke
paul
is
it
say
it
true
paul
alas
simone
too
true
taps
his
coat
there
it
lies
i
have
a
hundred
and
seventy
thousand
francs
to
pay
or
be
dishonoured
i
can
not
pay
the
sum
a
barbazange
does
not
survive
dishonour
my
ancestors
were
crusaders
preux
chevaliers
to
a
man
their
code
is
mine
dishonour
for
me
is
worse
than
death
simone
mon
dieu
paul
how
noble
you
are
lays
her
hands
on
his
shoulder
leans
back
and
surveys
him
at
arm
length
a
look
of
pride
and
anxious
happiness
on
her
paul
his
eyes
not
at
all
i
was
born
noble
and
noblesse
oblige
as
we
say
in
our
family
farewell
simone
i
love
you
and
i
must
die
my
last
thought
will
be
of
you
kisses
her
hand
rises
to
his
feet
and
makes
as
though
to
simone
him
by
the
no
paul
no
you
must
not
shall
not
do
anything
rash
a
hundred
and
seventy
thousand
francs
did
you
say
it
is
paltry
is
there
no
one
who
could
lend
or
give
you
the
money
paul
not
a
soul
farewell
simone
simone
stay
paul
i
hardly
dare
to
ask
it
of
you
you
with
such
lofty
ideas
of
honour
but
would
you
from
me
paul
take
money
from
a
woman
ah
simone
tempt
me
no
more
i
might
do
an
ignoble
act
simone
but
from
me
paul
from
me
i
am
not
in
your
eyes
a
woman
like
any
other
woman
am
i
paul
it
is
true
that
my
ancestors
the
crusaders
the
preux
chevaliers
might
in
all
honour
receive
gifts
from
the
ladies
of
their
choice
chargers
swords
armour
or
tenderer
mementoes
such
as
gloves
or
garters
but
money
no
who
ever
heard
of
their
taking
money
simone
but
what
would
be
the
use
of
my
giving
you
swords
and
horses
you
could
never
use
them
consider
my
knight
my
noble
sir
paul
in
these
days
the
contests
of
chivalry
have
assumed
a
different
form
the
weapons
and
the
armour
have
changed
your
sword
must
be
of
gold
and
paper
your
breastplate
of
hard
cash
your
charger
of
securities
i
offer
you
the
shining
panoply
of
the
modern
crusader
will
you
accept
it
paul
you
are
eloquent
simone
you
could
win
over
the
devil
himself
with
that
angelic
voice
of
yours
but
it
can
not
be
money
is
always
money
the
code
is
clear
i
can
not
accept
your
offer
here
is
the
way
out
takes
an
automatic
pistol
out
of
his
thank
you
simone
and
how
wonderful
is
the
love
of
a
pure
woman
simone
paul
paul
give
that
to
me
snatches
the
pistol
from
his
if
anything
were
to
happen
to
you
paul
i
should
kill
myself
with
this
you
must
live
you
must
consent
to
accept
the
money
you
must
let
your
honour
make
a
martyr
of
you
paul
a
tear
from
his
no
i
ca
give
me
that
pistol
i
beg
you
simone
for
my
sake
paul
paul
oh
you
make
it
impossible
for
me
to
act
as
the
voices
of
dead
ancestors
tell
me
i
should
for
your
sake
then
simone
i
consent
to
live
for
your
sake
i
dare
to
accept
the
gift
you
offer
simone
his
hand
in
an
outburst
of
thank
you
thank
you
paul
how
happy
i
am
paul
i
too
light
of
my
life
simone
my
month
allowance
arrived
i
have
the
cheque
here
takes
it
out
of
her
two
hundred
thousand
francs
signed
already
you
can
get
it
cashed
as
soon
as
the
hanks
open
paul
by
an
outburst
of
genuine
emotion
kisses
indiscriminately
the
cheque
the
baronne
his
own
my
angel
you
have
saved
me
how
can
i
thank
you
how
can
i
love
you
enough
ah
mon
petit
bouton
de
rose
simone
oh
naughty
naughty
not
now
my
paul
you
must
wait
till
some
other
time
paul
i
burn
with
impatience
simone
quelle
fougue
listen
then
in
an
hour
time
paul
chéri
in
my
boudoir
i
shall
be
alone
paul
an
hour
it
is
an
eternity
simone
an
hour
i
wo
relent
till
then
my
paul
blows
a
kiss
and
runs
out
the
scenery
trembles
at
her
paul
at
the
cheque
then
pulls
out
a
large
silk
handkerchief
and
wipes
his
neck
inside
his
dolphin
in
from
the
left
he
is
smoking
a
cigarette
but
he
does
not
seem
to
be
enjoying
paul
alone
dolphin
alas
paul
brooding
on
the
universe
as
usual
i
envy
you
your
philosophic
detachment
personally
i
find
that
the
world
is
very
much
too
much
with
us
and
the
devil
too
looks
at
the
cheque
in
his
and
above
all
the
flesh
my
god
the
flesh
wipes
his
neck
dolphin
my
philosophic
detachment
but
it
only
a
mask
to
hide
the
ineffectual
longings
i
have
to
achieve
contact
with
the
world
paul
but
surely
nothing
is
easier
one
just
makes
a
movement
and
impinges
on
one
dolphin
not
with
a
temperament
like
mine
imagine
a
shyness
more
powerful
than
curiosity
or
desire
a
paralysis
of
all
the
faculties
you
are
a
man
of
the
world
you
were
born
with
a
forehead
of
brass
to
affront
every
social
emergency
ah
if
you
knew
what
a
torture
it
is
to
find
yourself
in
the
presence
of
someone
a
woman
perhaps
someone
in
whom
you
take
an
interest
that
is
not
merely
philosophic
to
find
oneself
in
the
presence
of
such
a
person
and
to
be
incapable
yes
physically
incapable
of
saying
a
word
to
express
your
interest
in
her
or
your
desire
to
possess
her
intimacy
ah
i
notice
i
have
slipped
into
the
feminine
inevitably
for
of
course
the
person
is
always
a
she
paul
of
course
of
course
that
goes
without
saying
but
what
the
trouble
women
are
so
simple
to
deal
with
dolphin
i
know
perfectly
simply
if
one
in
the
right
state
of
mind
i
have
found
that
out
myself
for
moments
come
alas
how
rarely
when
i
am
filled
with
a
spirit
of
confidence
possessed
by
some
angel
or
devil
of
power
ah
then
i
feel
myself
to
be
superb
i
carry
all
before
me
in
those
brief
moments
the
whole
secret
of
the
world
is
revealed
to
me
i
perceive
that
the
supreme
quality
in
the
human
soul
is
effrontery
genius
in
the
man
of
action
is
simply
the
apotheosis
of
charlatanism
alexander
the
great
napoleon
gladstone
lloyd
george
what
are
they
just
ordinary
human
beings
projected
through
the
magic
lantern
of
a
prodigious
effrontery
and
so
magnified
to
a
thousand
times
larger
than
life
look
at
me
i
am
far
more
intelligent
than
any
of
these
fabulous
figures
my
sensibility
is
more
refined
than
theirs
i
am
morally
superior
to
any
of
them
and
yet
by
my
lack
of
charlatanism
i
am
made
less
than
nothing
my
qualities
are
projected
through
the
wrong
end
of
a
telescope
and
the
world
perceives
me
far
smaller
than
i
really
am
but
the
world
who
cares
about
the
world
the
only
people
who
matter
are
the
women
paul
very
true
my
dear
dolphin
the
women
looks
at
the
cheque
and
mops
himself
once
more
with
his
mauve
silk
dolphin
was
one
of
my
moments
of
triumph
i
felt
myself
suddenly
free
of
all
my
inhibitions
paul
i
hope
you
profited
by
the
auspicious
occasion
dolphin
i
did
i
was
making
headway
i
had
but
i
do
know
why
i
should
bore
you
with
my
confidences
curious
that
one
should
be
dumb
before
intimates
and
open
one
mind
to
an
all
but
stranger
i
must
apologise
paul
but
i
am
all
attention
and
sympathy
my
dear
dolphin
and
i
take
it
a
little
hardly
that
you
should
regard
me
as
a
stranger
lays
a
hand
on
dolphin
dolphin
thank
you
barbazange
thank
you
well
if
you
consent
to
be
the
receptacle
of
my
woes
i
shall
go
on
pouring
them
out
miss
toomis
but
tell
me
frankly
what
you
think
of
her
paul
well
dolphin
a
little
too
ingenuous
a
little
silly
even
eh
paul
now
you
say
so
she
certainly
is
very
intellectually
stimulating
dolphin
precisely
but
oh
those
eyes
that
ingenuousness
that
pathetic
and
enchanting
silliness
she
touches
lost
chords
in
one
heart
i
love
the
chromatic
fantasia
of
bach
i
am
transported
by
beethoven
sonata
but
the
fact
does
prevent
my
being
moved
to
tears
by
the
last
luscious
waltz
played
by
the
hotel
orchestra
in
the
best
constructed
brains
there
are
always
spongy
surfaces
that
are
sensitive
to
picture
postcards
and
little
nelly
and
the
end
of
a
perfect
day
miss
toomis
has
found
out
my
achilles
heel
she
is
boring
ridiculous
absurd
to
a
degree
but
oh
how
moving
how
adorable
paul
you
done
for
my
poor
dolphin
sunk
spurlos
dolphin
and
i
was
getting
on
so
well
was
revelling
in
my
confidence
and
knowing
its
transience
was
exploiting
it
for
all
i
was
worth
i
had
covered
an
enormous
amount
of
ground
and
then
hey
presto
at
a
blow
all
my
labour
was
undone
actuated
by
what
malice
i
do
know
la
lucrezia
swoops
down
like
a
vulture
and
without
a
or
excuse
of
any
kind
carries
off
miss
toomis
from
under
my
very
eyes
what
a
woman
she
terrifies
me
i
am
always
running
away
from
her
paul
which
means
i
suppose
that
she
is
always
pursuing
you
dolphin
she
has
ruined
my
evening
and
it
may
me
all
my
chances
of
success
my
precious
hour
of
will
be
wasted
though
i
hope
you
not
take
offence
at
the
word
wasted
on
you
paul
it
will
return
dolphin
but
when
but
when
till
it
does
i
shall
be
impotent
and
in
agony
paul
i
know
the
agony
of
waiting
i
myself
was
engaged
to
a
rumanian
princess
in
but
owing
to
the
sad
collapse
in
the
rumanian
rate
of
exchange
i
have
had
to
postpone
our
union
indefinitely
it
is
painful
but
believe
me
it
can
be
borne
looks
at
the
cheque
and
then
at
his
there
are
other
things
which
are
much
worse
believe
me
dolphin
it
can
be
borne
dolphin
i
suppose
it
can
for
when
all
is
said
there
are
damned
few
of
us
who
really
take
things
much
to
heart
julie
de
lespinasses
are
happily
not
common
i
am
even
subnormal
at
twenty
i
believed
myself
passionate
one
does
at
that
age
but
now
when
i
come
to
consider
myself
candidly
i
find
that
i
am
really
one
of
those
who
never
deeply
felt
nor
strongly
willed
everything
is
profoundly
indifferent
to
me
i
sometimes
try
to
depress
myself
with
the
thought
that
the
world
is
a
that
men
are
pathetic
degenerates
from
the
ape
whose
laboriously
manufactured
ideals
are
pure
nonsense
and
find
no
rhyme
in
reality
that
the
whole
of
life
is
a
bad
joke
which
takes
a
long
time
coming
to
an
end
but
it
really
does
upset
me
i
do
care
a
curse
it
deplorable
one
ought
to
care
the
best
people
do
care
still
i
must
say
i
should
like
to
get
possession
of
miss
toomis
confound
that
grattarol
woman
what
on
earth
did
she
want
to
rush
me
like
that
for
do
you
suppose
paul
i
expect
we
shall
find
out
now
paul
his
head
towards
the
lucrezia
amy
seen
entering
from
the
lucrezia
her
companion
arm
and
marches
with
a
firm
step
towards
the
two
amy
herself
to
be
drugged
lucrezia
vicomte
miss
toomis
wants
you
to
tell
her
all
about
correggio
amy
oh
really
i
lucrezia
and
and
michelangelo
she
is
so
much
interested
in
art
amy
but
please
do
trouble
paul
i
shall
be
delighted
and
in
return
i
hope
miss
toomis
will
tell
me
all
about
longfellow
amy
oh
yes
do
you
just
love
evangeline
paul
i
do
and
with
your
help
miss
toomis
i
hope
i
shall
learn
to
love
her
better
lucrezia
dolphin
has
been
looking
amy
vicomte
back
again
amy
eyes
that
betray
a
certain
you
really
must
come
and
look
at
the
moon
rising
over
the
hills
dolphin
one
sees
it
best
from
the
lower
terrace
shall
we
go
dolphin
and
but
it
rather
cold
is
it
i
mean
i
think
i
ought
to
go
and
write
a
letter
lucrezia
oh
you
can
do
that
dolphin
but
really
lucrezia
you
no
idea
how
lovely
the
moon
looks
dolphin
but
i
must
lucrezia
her
hand
on
his
sleeve
and
tows
hint
after
her
crying
as
she
the
moon
the
moon

amy
their
exit
in
paul
he
does
look
as
though
he
much
wanted
to
go
and
see
the
moon
amy
perhaps
he
guesses
what
in
store
for
him
paul
what
you
do
mean
to
say
you
realised
all
the
time
amy
realised
what
paul
about
la
belle
lucrezia
amy
i
do
know
what
you
mean
all
i
know
is
that
she
means
to
give
dolphin
a
good
talking
to
he
so
mercenary
it
made
me
quite
indignant
when
she
told
me
about
him
such
a
schemer
too
you
know
in
america
we
have
very
definite
ideas
about
honour
paul
here
too
miss
toomis
amy
not
dolphin
oh
dear
it
made
me
so
sad
more
sad
than
angry
i
can
never
be
grateful
enough
to
signorina
grattarol
paul
but
i
still
at
a
loss
to
know
exactly
what
you
talking
about
amy
and
i
am
quite
bewildered
myself
would
you
have
believed
it
of
him
i
thought
him
such
a
nice
man
paul
what
has
he
done
amy
it
all
for
my
money
miss
grattarol
told
me
she
knows
he
was
just
asking
me
to
marry
him
and
i
believe
i
would
have
said
yes
but
she
came
in
just
in
the
nick
of
time
it
seems
he
only
wanted
to
marry
me
because
i
so
rich
he
does
care
for
me
at
all
miss
grattarol
knows
what
he
like
it
awful
is
it
oh
dear
i
would
have
thought
it
of
him
paul
but
you
must
forgive
him
miss
toomis
money
is
a
great
temptation
perhaps
if
you
gave
him
another
chance
amy
impossible
paul
poor
dolphin
he
such
a
nice
young
fellow
amy
i
thought
so
too
but
he
false
paul
do
be
too
hard
on
him
money
probably
means
too
much
to
him
it
the
fault
of
his
upbringing
no
one
who
has
not
lived
among
the
traditions
of
our
ancient
aristocracy
can
be
expected
to
have
that
contempt
almost
that
hatred
of
wealth
which
is
the
sign
of
true
nobility
if
he
had
been
brought
up
as
i
was
in
an
old
machicolated
castle
on
the
loire
surrounded
by
ancestral
ghosts
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
the
crusaders
and
preux
chevaliers
who
had
inhabited
the
place
in
the
past
if
he
had
learnt
to
know
what
noblesse
oblige
really
means
believe
me
miss
toomis
he
could
never
have
done
such
a
thing
amy
i
should
just
think
he
could
monsieur
de
barbazange
paul
you
have
no
idea
miss
toomis
how
difficult
it
is
for
a
man
of
truly
noble
feelings
to
get
over
the
fact
of
your
great
wealth
when
i
heard
that
you
were
the
possessor
of
a
hundred
million
dollars
amy
oh
i
afraid
it
more
than
that
it
two
hundred
million
paul
of
two
hundred
million
dollars
then
it
only
makes
it
worse
i
was
very
melancholy
miss
toomis
for
those
two
hundred
million
dollars
were
a
barrier
which
a
descendant
of
crusaders
and
preux
chevaliers
could
not
overleap
honour
miss
toomis
honour
forbade
ah
if
only
that
accursed
money
had
not
stood
in
the
way
when
i
first
saw
you
oh
how
i
was
moved
by
that
vision
of
beauty
and
innocence
i
wanted
nothing
better
than
to
stand
gazing
on
you
for
ever
but
then
i
heard
about
those
millions
dolphin
was
lucky
to
have
felt
no
restraints
but
enough
enough
checks
a
rising
tide
of
give
poor
dolphin
another
chance
miss
toomis
at
bottom
he
is
a
good
fellow
and
he
may
learn
in
time
to
esteem
you
for
your
own
sake
and
to
forget
the
dazzling
millions
amy
never
i
can
only
marry
a
man
who
is
entirely
disinterested
paul
but
ca
you
see
no
disinterested
man
could
ever
bring
himself
to
ask
you
how
could
he
prove
his
disinterestedness
no
one
would
believe
the
purity
of
his
intentions
amy
it
is
for
me
to
judge
i
know
a
disinterested
man
when
i
see
him
even
in
america
we
can
understand
honour
paul
a
sob
in
his
miss
toomis
amy
but
no
i
do
want
it
to
be
paul
it
must
be
never
shall
it
be
said
of
a
barbazange
that
he
hunted
a
woman
for
her
money
amy
but
what
does
it
matter
what
the
world
says
if
i
say
the
opposite
paul
you
say
the
opposite
thank
you
thank
you
but
no
amy
stop
oh
you
forcing
me
to
do
a
most
unwomanly
thing
making
me
ask
you
to
marry
me
you
the
only
disinterested
man
ever
met
or
to
judge
from
what
i
seen
of
the
world
i
ever
likely
to
meet
have
you
kept
away
from
me
in
spite
of
your
feelings
have
you
even
tried
to
make
me
listen
to
another
man
a
man
not
worthy
to
black
your
boots
oh
it
so
wonderful
so
noble
it
like
something
in
a
picture
play
paul
i
offer
myself
to
you
will
you
take
me
in
spite
of
my
millions
paul
on
his
knees
and
kissing
the
hem
amy
my
angel
you
right
what
does
it
matter
what
the
world
says
as
long
as
you
believe
in
me

amie
ah
it
too
good

too
good
to
be

an
unfeigned
amy

tell
anyone
about
our
engagement

might
say
unpleasant
things

the
hotel

amy
of
course
i
wo
talk
about
it
we
keep
our
happiness
to

than

of
a
window

opened

heard
they
look
up
and
see
baroness
in
a
peignoir
of
the
tenderest
blue
emerging
on
to
the
right
hand
of
the
three
amy

is
you
re
quite
right
two
hundred
million
i
come
my
juliet
darts
into
the
hotel
pausing
when
just
inside
the
door
and
out
of
sight
of
baroness
mop
himself
once
again
with
his
enormous
handkerchief
the
operation
over
he
advances
with
a
resolute
step
baroness
for
a
moment
on
the
balcony
then
dolphin
lucrezia
in
from
the
left
she
retires
closing
the
window
and
drawing
the
curtains
behind
dolphin
striding
lucrezia
a
little
behind
looking
anxiously
up
at
lucrezia
please
please
dolphin
no
i
won
t
listen
to
anything
more
walks
with
an
agitated
step
up
and
down
the
lucrezia
with
one
hand
resting
on
the
back
of
a
chair
and
the
other
pressed
on
her
heart
do
you
mean
to
say
you
deliberately
went
and
told
her
that
i
was
only
after
her
money
oh
it
too
bad
too
bad
it
infamous
and
i
had
the
faintest
notion
that
she
had
any
money
besides
i
do
want
money
i
have
quite
enough
of
my
own
it
infamous
infamous
lucrezia
i
know
it
was
a
horrible
thing
to
do
but
i
could
help
it
how
could
i
stand
by
and
see
you
being
carried
off
by
that
silly
little
creature
dolphin
but
i
cared
for
her
lucrezia
but
not
as
i
cared
for
you
i
got
red
blood
in
my
veins
she
got
nothing
but
milk
and
water
you
could
have
been
happy
with
her
i
can
give
you
love
of
a
kind
she
could
never
dream
of
what
does
she
know
of
passion
dolphin
nothing
i
am
thankful
to
say
i
do
want
passion
ca
you
understand
that
i
do
possess
it
myself
and
do
like
it
in
others
i
am
a
man
of
sentimental
affections
with
a
touch
of
quiet
sensuality
i
do
want
passion
i
tell
you
it
too
violent
it
frightens
me
i
could
possibly
live
with
you
you
utterly
shatter
my
peace
of
mind
in
a
day
oh
how
i
wish
you
go
away
lucrezia
but
sidney
sidney
ca
you
understand
what
it
is
to
be
madly
in
love
with
somebody
you
ca
be
so
cruel
dolphin
you
did
think
much
of
my
when
you
interfered
between
miss
toomis
and
me
did
you
you
probably
ruined
my
whole
life
that
all
i
really
do
see
why
you
should
expect
me
to
have
any
pity
for
you
lucrezia
very
well
then
i
shall
kill
myself
bursts
into
dolphin
oh
but
i
assure
you
one
does
kill
oneself
for
things
like
that
approaches
her
and
pats
her
on
the
come
come
do
worry
about
it
lucrezia
her
arms
round
his
oh
sidney
sidney
dolphin
himself
with
surprising
energy
and
promptitude
from
her
no
no
none
of
that
i
beg
another
moment
and
we
shall
be
losing
our
heads
personally
i
think
i
shall
go
to
bed
now
i
should
advise
you
to
do
the
same
miss
grattarol
you
overwrought
we
might
all
be
better
for
a
small
dose
of
bromide
goes
lucrezia
up
and
stretching
forth
her
sidney
dolphin
not
look
round
and
disappears
through
the
glass
door
into
the
lucrezia
her
face
with
her
hands
and
sits
for
a
little
sobbing
silently
the
nightingale
sings
on
midnight
sounds
with
an
infinite
melancholy
from
all
the
twenty
campaniles
of
the
city
in
the
valley
from
far
away
comes
the
spasmodic
throbbing
of
a
guitar
and
the
singing
of
an
italian
voice
passionate
throaty
the
seconds
lucrezia
to
her
feet
and
walks
slowly
into
the
hotel
on
the
threshold
she
encounters
vicomte
paul
you
signorina
lucrezia
i
escaped
for
a
breath
of
fresh
cool
air
might
we
take
a
turn
together
lucrezia
her
ah
well
then
you
be
glad
to
hear
that
miss
toomis
knows
all
about
correggio
now
inhales
a
deep
breath
of
air
then
looking
at
his
he
begins
brushing
at
it
with
his
hand
a
lamentable
figure
creeps
in
from
the
left
it
alberto
he
had
a
tail
it
would
be
trailing
on
the
ground
between
his
paul
hullo
alberto
what
is
it
been
losing
at
cards
alberto
worse
than
that
paul
creditors
foreclosing
alberto
much
worse
paul
father
ruined
by
imprudent
speculations
alberto
no
no
no
it
nothing
to
do
with
money
paul
oh
well
then
it
ca
be
anything
very
serious
it
women
i
suppose
alberto
my
mistress
refuses
to
see
me
i
have
been
beating
on
her
door
for
hours
in
vain
paul
i
wish
we
all
had
your
luck
bertino
mine
opens
her
door
only
too
promptly
the
difficulty
is
to
get
out
again
does
yours
use
such
an
awful
lot
of
this
powder
i
simply
covered
with
it
ugh
brushes
his
coat
alberto
ca
you
be
serious
paul
paul
of
course
i
can
about
a
serious
matter
but
you
ca
expect
me
to
pull
a
long
face
about
your
mistress
can
you
now
do
look
at
things
in
their
right
proportions
alberto
it
no
use
talking
to
you
you
heartless
soulless
paul
what
you
mean
my
dear
alberto
is
that
i
relatively
speaking
bodiless
physical
passion
never
goes
to
my
head
i
always
you
are
that
all
alberto
oh
you
disgust
me
i
think
i
shall
hang
myself
paul
do
it
will
give
us
something
to
talk
about
at
lunch
alberto
monster
goes
into
the
paul
out
towards
the
garden
whistling
an
air
from
mozart
as
he
goes
the
window
on
the
left
opens
lucrezia
on
to
her
balcony
uncoiled
her
red
hair
falls
almost
to
her
waist
her
nightdress
is
always
half
slipping
off
one
shoulder
or
the
other
like
those
restoration
gowns
that
reveal
the
charms
of
kneller
beauties
her
feet
are
bare
she
is
a
marvellously
romantic
figure
as
she
stands
there
leaning
on
the
balustrade
and
with
eyes
more
sombre
than
night
gazing
into
the
darkness
the
nightingales
the
bells
the
guitar
and
passionate
voice
strike
up
great
stars
palpitate
in
the
sky
the
moon
has
swum
imperceptibly
to
the
height
of
heaven
in
the
garden
below
flowers
are
yielding
their
souls
into
the
air
censers
invisible
it
is
too
much
too
much
large
tears
roll
lucrezia
and
fall
with
a
splash
to
the
ground
suddenly
but
with
the
noiselessness
of
a
cat
alberto
in
pink
pajamas
on
the
middle
of
the
three
balconies
he
lucrezia
she
is
much
too
deeply
absorbed
in
thought
to
have
noticed
his
alberto
his
elbows
on
the
rail
of
the
balcony
covers
his
face
and
begins
to
sob
at
first
inaudibly
then
in
a
gradual
quickening
crescendo
at
the
seventh
lucrezia
and
becomes
aware
of
his
lucrezia
alberto
i
did
know
have
you
been
there
long
alberto
no
articulate
reply
but
his
sobs
keep
on
growing
alberto

you
unhappy

difficulty
after
a
yes
lucrezia
did
she
let
you
in
alberto

up
a
blubbered
face
to

more
unhappy
than

but

more
unhappy

so
cruel
lucrezia
covers
his
face
once
lucrezia
but
i
only
said

was
unhappy
alberto
alberto
yes
i
know
that
showed
you
were
thinking
of
me
nobody

i
shall
hang
myself
with
the
cord
of
my
lucrezia

do
anything
rash
alberto
i
shall
your
cruelty
has
been
the
last
straw
lucrezia
i
sorry
bertino
mio
but
if
you

a
mother
to
me
stretches
out
his
hand
and
seizes
hers
which
has
gone
to
meet
him
but
the
balconies
are
too
far
apart
to
allow
him
to
kiss
it
he
makes
an
effort
and
fails
he
is
too
short
in
the
will
you
let
me
come
onto
your
balcony
lucrezia
i
want
to
tell
you
how
grateful
i
am
lucrezia
but
you
can
do
that
from
your
own
balcony
alberto
please
please
lucrezia
you
must
be
cruel
to
me
again
i
ca
bear
it
lucrezia
well
then
just
for
a
moment
but
for
no
more
bertino
from
one
balcony
to
the
other
one
is
a
little
reminded
of
the
trousered
monkeys
on
the
barrel
organs
arrived
he
kneels
down
and
lucrezia
alberto
you
saved
me
you
given
given
me
a
fresh
desire
to
live
and
a
fresh
faith
in
life
how
can
i
thank
you
enough
lucrezia
darling
lucrezia
his
there
there
are
just
two
unhappy
creatures
we
must
try
and
comfort
one
another
alberto
what
a
brute
i
am
i
never
thought
of
your
unhappiness
i
am
so
selfish
what
is
it
lucrezia
lucrezia
i
ca
tell
you
bertino
but
it
very
painful
alberto
poor
child
poor
child
kisses
which
started
at
the
hand
have
mounted
by
this
time
some
way
up
the
arm
changing
perceptibly
in
character
as
they
rise
at
the
shoulder
they
have
a
warmth
which
could
not
have
been
inferred
from
the
respectful
salutes
which
barely
touched
the
poor
darling
you
given
me
consolation
now
you
must
let
me
comfort
your
unhappiness
lucrezia
an
i
think
you
ought
to
go
back
now
bertino
alberto
in
a
minute
my
darling
there
there
poor
lucrezia
puts
an
arm
round
her
kisses
her
hair
and
lucrezia
her
bowed
head
against
his
chest
the
sound
of
footsteps
is
heard
they
both
look
up
with
scared
lucrezia
we
must
be
seen
here
bertino
what
would
people
think
alberto
i
go
back
lucrezia
there
no
time
you
must
come
into
my
room
quickly
slip
through
the
french
window
but
not
quickly
enough
to
have
escaped
the
notice
paul
from
his
midnight
stroll
vicomte
for
a
moment
looking
up
at
the
empty
balcony
he
laughs
softly
to
himself
and
throwing
his
cigarette
away
passes
through
the
glass
door
into
the
house
all
is
now
silent
save
for
the
nightingales
and
the
distant
bells
the
curtain
comes
down
for
a
moment
to
indicate
the
passage
of
several
hours
it
rises
again
with
the
opens
and
she
appears
on
the
balcony
she
stands
a
moment
with
one
foot
over
the
threshold
of
the
long
window
in
a
listening
pose
then
her
eyes
fall
on
the
better
half
of
a
pair
of
pink
pyjamas
lying
crumpled
on
the
floor
like
a
body
bereft
of
its
soul
with
her
bare
foot
she
turns
it
over
a
little
shudder
plucks
at
her
nerves
and
she
shakes
her
head
as
though
by
this
symbolic
act
to
shake
off
something
clinging
and
contaminating
then
she
steps
out
into
the
full
glory
of
the
early
sun
stretching
out
her
arms
to
the
radiance
she
bows
her
face
into
her
hands
crying
out
loud
to
lucrezia
oh
why
why
why
last
of
these
why
is
caught
by
waiter
has
crept
forth
in
and
duster
in
hand
to
clean
the
tables
he
looks
up
at
her
admiringly
passes
his
tongue
over
his
lips
then
with
a
sigh
turns
to
dust
the
curtain
iii
the
tillotson
banquet
i
young
spode
was
not
a
snob
he
was
too
intelligent
for
that
too
fundamentally
decent
not
a
snob
but
all
the
same
he
could
not
help
feeling
very
well
pleased
at
the
thought
that
he
was
dining
alone
and
intimately
with
lord
badgery
it
was
a
definite
event
in
his
life
a
step
forward
he
felt
towards
that
final
success
social
material
and
literary
which
he
had
come
to
london
with
the
fixed
intention
of
making
the
conquest
and
capture
of
badgery
was
an
almost
essential
strategical
move
in
the
campaign
edmund
baron
badgery
was
a
lineal
descendant
of
that
edmund
surnamed
le
blayreau
who
landed
on
english
soil
in
the
train
of
william
the
conqueror
ennobled
by
william
rufus
the
badgerys
had
been
one
of
the
very
few
baronial
families
to
survive
the
wars
of
the
roses
and
all
the
other
changes
and
chances
of
english
history
they
were
a
sensible
and
philoprogenitive
race
no
badgery
had
ever
fought
in
any
war
no
badgery
had
ever
engaged
in
any
kind
of
politics
they
had
been
content
to
live
and
quietly
to
propagate
their
species
in
a
huge
machicolated
norman
castle
surrounded
by
a
triple
moat
only
sallying
forth
to
cultivate
their
property
and
to
collect
their
rents
in
the
eighteenth
century
when
life
had
become
relatively
secure
the
badgerys
began
to
venture
forth
into
civilised
society
from
boorish
squires
they
blossomed
into
patrons
of
the
arts
virtuosi
their
property
was
large
they
were
rich
and
with
the
growth
of
industrialism
their
riches
also
grew
villages
on
their
estate
turned
into
manufacturing
towns
unsuspected
coal
was
discovered
beneath
the
surface
of
their
barren
moorlands
by
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
badgerys
were
among
the
richest
of
english
noble
families
the
baron
disposed
of
an
income
of
at
least
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
a
year
following
the
great
badgery
tradition
he
had
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
politics
or
war
he
occupied
himself
by
collecting
pictures
he
took
an
interest
in
theatrical
productions
he
was
the
friend
and
patron
of
men
of
letters
of
painters
and
musician
a
personage
in
a
word
of
considerable
consequence
in
that
particular
world
in
which
young
spode
had
elected
to
make
his
success
spode
had
only
recently
left
the
university
simon
gollamy
the
editor
of
the
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds
had
got
to
know
him
he
was
always
on
the
look
out
for
youthful
talent
had
seen
possibilities
in
the
young
man
and
appointed
him
art
critic
of
his
paper
gollamy
liked
to
have
young
and
teachable
people
about
him
the
possession
of
disciples
flattered
his
vanity
and
he
found
it
easier
moreover
to
run
his
paper
with
docile
collaborators
than
with
men
grown
obstinate
and
with
age
spode
had
not
done
badly
at
his
new
job
at
any
rate
his
articles
had
been
intelligent
enough
to
arouse
the
interest
of
lord
badgery
it
was
ultimately
to
them
that
he
owed
the
honour
of
sitting
to
night
in
the
of
badgery
house
fortified
by
several
varieties
of
wine
and
a
glass
of
aged
brandy
spode
felt
more
confident
and
at
ease
than
he
had
done
the
whole
evening
badgery
was
rather
a
disquieting
host
he
had
an
alarming
habit
of
changing
the
subject
of
any
conversation
that
had
lasted
for
more
than
two
minutes
spode
had
found
it
for
example
horribly
mortifying
when
his
host
cutting
across
what
was
he
prided
himself
a
particularly
subtle
and
illuminating
disquisition
on
baroque
art
had
turned
a
wandering
eye
about
the
room
and
asked
him
abruptly
whether
he
liked
parrots
he
had
flushed
and
glanced
suspiciously
towards
him
fancying
that
the
man
was
trying
to
be
offensive
but
no
badgery
white
fleshy
hanoverian
face
wore
an
expression
of
perfect
good
faith
there
was
no
malice
in
his
small
greenish
eyes
he
evidently
did
genuinely
want
to
know
if
spode
liked
parrots
the
young
man
swallowed
his
irritation
and
replied
that
he
did
badgery
then
told
a
good
story
about
parrots
spode
was
on
the
point
of
capping
it
with
a
better
story
when
his
host
began
to
talk
about
beethoven
and
so
the
game
went
on
spode
cut
his
conversation
to
suit
his
host
requirements
in
the
course
of
ten
minutes
he
had
made
a
more
or
less
witty
epigram
on
benvenuto
cellini
queen
victoria
sport
god
stephen
phillips
and
moorish
architecture
lord
badgery
thought
him
the
most
charming
young
man
and
so
intelligent
if
you
quite
finished
your
coffee
he
said
rising
to
his
feet
as
he
spoke
we
go
and
look
at
the
pictures
spode
jumped
up
with
alacrity
and
only
then
realised
that
he
had
drunk
just
ever
so
little
too
much
he
would
have
to
be
careful
talk
deliberately
plant
his
feet
consciously
one
after
the
other
this
house
is
quite
cluttered
up
with
pictures
lord
badgery
complained
i
had
a
whole
taken
away
to
the
country
last
week
but
there
are
still
far
too
many
my
ancestors
would
have
their
portraits
painted
by
romney
such
a
shocking
artist
do
you
think
why
could
they
have
chosen
gainsborough
or
even
reynolds
i
had
all
the
romneys
hung
in
the
servants
hall
now
it
such
a
comfort
to
know
that
one
can
never
possibly
see
them
again
i
suppose
you
know
all
about
the
ancient
hittites
well
the
young
man
replied
with
befitting
modesty
look
at
that
then
he
indicated
a
large
stone
head
which
stood
in
a
case
near
the
door
it
not
greek
or
egyptian
or
persian
or
anything
else
so
if
it
is
ancient
hittite
i
do
know
what
it
is
and
that
reminds
me
of
that
story
about
lord
george
sanger
the
circus
king
and
without
giving
spode
time
to
examine
the
hittite
relic
he
led
the
way
up
the
huge
staircase
pausing
every
now
and
then
in
his
anecdote
to
point
out
some
new
object
of
curiosity
or
beauty
i
suppose
you
know
deburau
pantomimes
spode
rapped
out
as
soon
as
the
story
was
over
he
was
in
an
itch
to
let
out
his
information
about
deburau
badgery
had
given
him
a
perfect
opening
with
his
ridiculous
sanger
what
a
perfect
man
is
he
he
used
to
this
is
my
main
gallery
said
lord
badgery
throwing
open
one
leaf
of
a
tall
folding
door
i
must
apologise
for
it
it
looks
like
a
rink
he
fumbled
with
the
electric
switches
and
there
was
suddenly
light
light
that
revealed
an
enormous
gallery
duly
receding
into
distance
according
to
all
the
laws
of
perspective
i
dare
say
you
heard
of
my
poor
father
lord
badgery
continued
a
little
insane
you
know
sort
of
mechanical
genius
with
a
screw
loose
he
used
to
have
a
toy
railway
in
this
room
no
end
of
fun
he
had
crawling
about
the
floor
after
his
trains
and
all
the
pictures
were
stacked
in
the
cellars
i
ca
tell
you
what
they
were
like
when
i
found
them
mushrooms
growing
out
of
the
botticellis
now
i
rather
proud
of
this
poussin
he
painted
it
for
scarron
exquisite
spode
exclaimed
making
with
his
hand
a
gesture
as
though
he
were
modelling
a
pure
form
in
the
air
how
splendid
the
onrush
of
those
trees
and
leaning
figures
is
and
the
way
they
re
caught
up
as
it
were
and
stemmed
by
that
single
godlike
form
opposing
them
with
his
contrary
movement
and
the
draperies
but
lord
badgery
had
moved
on
and
was
standing
in
front
of
a
little
virgin
of
carved
wood
school
of
rheims
he
explained
they
did
the
gallery
at
high
speed
badgery
never
permitted
his
guest
to
halt
for
more
than
forty
seconds
before
any
work
of
art
spode
would
have
liked
to
spend
a
few
moments
of
recollection
and
tranquillity
in
front
of
some
of
these
lovely
things
but
it
was
not
permitted
the
gallery
done
they
passed
into
a
little
room
leading
out
of
it
at
the
sight
of
what
the
lights
revealed
spode
gasped
it
like
something
out
of
balzac
he
exclaimed
un
de
ces
salons
dorés
où
se
déploie
un
luxe
insolent
you
know
my
chamber
badgery
explained
the
best
thing
of
its
kind
i
flatter
myself
outside
the
state
apartments
at
windsor
spode
tiptoed
round
the
room
peering
with
astonishment
at
all
the
objects
in
glass
in
gilded
bronze
in
china
in
leathers
in
embroidered
and
painted
silk
in
beads
in
wax
objects
of
the
most
fantastic
shapes
and
colours
all
the
queer
products
of
a
decadent
tradition
with
which
the
room
was
crowded
there
were
paintings
on
the
walls
a
martin
a
wilkie
an
early
landseer
several
ettys
a
big
haydon
a
slight
pretty
of
a
girl
by
wainewright
the
pupil
of
blake
and
arsenic
poisoner
a
score
of
others
but
the
picture
which
arrested
spode
attention
was
a
medium
sized
canvas
representing
troilus
riding
into
troy
among
the
flowers
and
plaudits
of
an
admiring
crowd
and
oblivious
you
could
see
from
his
expression
of
everything
but
the
eyes
of
cressida
who
looked
down
at
him
from
a
window
with
pandarus
smiling
over
her
shoulder
what
an
absurd
and
enchanting
picture
spode
exclaimed
ah
you
spotted
my
troilus
lord
badgery
was
pleased
what
bright
harmonious
colours
like
etty
only
stronger
not
so
obviously
pretty
and
there
an
energy
about
it
that
reminds
one
of
haydon
only
haydon
could
never
have
done
anything
so
impeccable
in
taste
who
is
it
by
spode
turned
to
his
host
inquiringly
you
were
right
in
detecting
haydon
lord
badgery
answered
it
by
his
pupil
tillotson
i
wish
i
could
get
hold
of
more
of
his
work
but
nobody
seems
to
know
anything
about
him
and
he
seems
to
have
done
so
little
this
time
it
was
the
younger
man
who
interrupted
tillotson
tillotson
he
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
a
frown
incongruously
distorted
his
round
floridly
curved
face
no
yes
i
have
it
he
looked
up
triumphantly
with
serene
and
childish
brows
tillotson
walter
tillotson
the
man
still
alive
badgery
smiled
this
picture
was
painted
in
you
know
well
that
all
right
say
he
was
born
in
painted
his
masterpiece
when
he
was
and
it
now
that
to
say
he
only
not
as
old
as
titian
yet
but
he
not
been
heard
of
since
lord
badgery
protested
precisely
your
mention
of
his
name
reminded
me
of
the
discovery
i
made
the
other
day
when
i
was
looking
through
the
obituary
notices
in
the
archives
of
the
one
has
to
bring
them
up
to
date
every
year
or
so
for
fear
of
being
caught
napping
if
one
of
these
t
old
birds
chooses
to
shuffle
off
suddenly
well
there
among
them
i
remember
my
astonishment
at
the
time
there
i
found
walter
tillotson
biography
pretty
full
to
and
then
a
blank
except
for
a
pencil
note
in
the
early
nineteen
hundreds
to
the
effect
that
he
had
returned
from
the
east
the
obituary
has
never
been
used
or
added
to
i
draw
the
obvious
conclusion
the
old
chap
is
dead
yet
he
just
been
overlooked
somehow
but
this
is
extraordinary
lord
badgery
exclaimed
you
must
find
him
spode
you
must
find
him
i
commission
him
to
paint
frescoes
round
this
room
it
just
what
i
always
vainly
longed
for
a
real
artist
to
decorate
this
place
for
me
oh
we
must
find
him
at
once
at
once
lord
badgery
strode
up
and
down
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
i
can
see
how
this
room
could
be
made
quite
perfect
he
went
on
clear
away
all
these
cases
and
have
the
whole
of
that
wall
filled
by
a
heroic
fresco
of
hector
and
andromache
or
for
rent
or
fanny
kemble
as
belvidera
in
preserved
anything
like
that
provided
it
in
the
grand
manner
of
the
and
and
here
i
have
a
landscape
with
lovely
receding
perspectives
or
else
something
architectural
and
grand
in
the
style
of
belshazzar
feast
then
we
have
this
adam
fireplace
taken
down
and
replaced
by
something
and
on
these
walls
i
have
mirrors
or
no
let
me
see
he
sank
into
meditative
silence
from
which
he
finally
roused
himself
to
shout
the
old
man
the
old
man
spode
we
must
find
this
astonishing
old
creature
and
do
breathe
a
word
to
anybody
tillotson
shall
be
our
secret
oh
it
too
perfect
it
incredible
think
of
the
frescoes
lord
badgery
face
had
become
positively
animated
he
had
talked
of
a
single
subject
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ii
three
weeks
later
lord
badgery
was
aroused
from
his
usual
somnolence
by
the
arrival
of
a
telegram
the
message
was
a
short
one
spode
a
look
of
pleasure
and
intelligence
made
human
lord
badgery
clayey
face
of
surfeit
no
answer
he
said
the
footman
padded
away
on
noiseless
feet
lord
badgery
closed
his
eyes
and
began
to
contemplate
found
what
a
room
he
would
have
there
would
be
nothing
like
it
in
the
world
the
frescoes
the
fireplace
the
mirrors
the
ceiling
and
a
small
shrivelled
old
man
clambering
about
the
scaffolding
agile
and
quick
like
one
of
those
whiskered
little
monkeys
at
the
zoo
painting
away
painting
away
fanny
kemble
as
belvidera
hector
and
andromache
or
why
not
the
duke
of
clarence
in
the
butt
the
duke
of
malmsey
the
butt
of
clarence
lord
badgery
was
asleep
spode
did
not
lag
long
behind
his
telegram
he
was
at
badgery
house
by
six
his
lordship
was
in
the
chamber
engaged
in
clearing
away
with
his
own
hands
the
spode
found
him
looking
hot
and
out
of
breath
ah
there
you
are
said
lord
badgery
you
see
me
already
preparing
for
the
great
man
coming
now
you
must
tell
me
all
about
him
he
older
even
than
i
thought
said
spode
he
this
year
born
in
incredible
is
it
there
i
beginning
at
the
wrong
end
begin
where
you
like
said
badgery
genially
i
wo
tell
you
all
the
incidents
of
the
hunt
you
no
idea
what
a
job
i
had
to
run
him
to
earth
it
was
like
a
sherlock
holmes
story
immensely
elaborate
too
elaborate
i
shall
write
a
book
about
it
some
day
at
any
rate
i
found
him
at
last
where
in
a
sort
of
respectable
slum
in
holloway
older
and
poorer
and
lonelier
than
you
could
have
believed
possible
i
found
out
how
it
was
he
came
to
be
forgotten
how
he
came
to
drop
out
of
life
in
the
way
he
did
he
took
it
into
his
head
somewhere
about
the
to
go
to
palestine
to
get
local
colour
for
his
religious
pictures
scapegoats
and
things
you
know
well
he
went
to
jerusalem
and
then
on
to
mount
lebanon
and
on
and
on
and
then
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
asia
minor
he
got
stuck
he
got
stuck
for
about
forty
years
but
what
did
he
do
all
that
time
oh
he
painted
and
started
a
mission
and
converted
three
turks
and
taught
the
local
pashas
the
rudiments
of
english
latin
and
perspective
and
god
knows
what
else
then
in
about
it
seems
to
have
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
getting
rather
old
and
had
been
away
from
home
for
rather
a
long
time
so
he
made
his
way
back
to
england
only
to
find
that
everyone
he
had
known
was
dead
that
the
dealers
had
never
heard
of
him
and
would
buy
his
pictures
that
he
was
simply
a
ridiculous
old
figure
of
fun
so
he
got
a
job
as
a
in
a
girl
school
in
holloway
and
there
he
been
ever
since
growing
older
and
older
and
feebler
and
feebler
and
blinder
and
deafer
and
generally
more
gaga
until
finally
the
school
has
given
him
the
sack
he
had
about
ten
pounds
in
the
world
when
i
found
him
he
lives
in
a
kind
of
black
hole
in
a
basement
full
of
beetles
when
his
ten
pounds
are
spent
i
suppose
he
just
quietly
die
there
badgery
held
up
a
white
hand
no
more
no
more
i
find
literature
quite
depressing
enough
i
insist
that
life
at
least
shall
be
a
little
gayer
did
you
tell
him
i
wanted
him
to
paint
my
room
but
he
ca
paint
he
too
blind
and
palsied
ca
paint
badgery
exclaimed
in
horror
then
what
the
good
of
the
old
creature
well
if
you
put
it
like
that
spode
began
i
shall
never
have
my
frescoes
ring
the
bell
will
you
spode
rang
what
right
has
tillotson
to
go
on
existing
if
he
ca
paint
went
on
lord
badgery
petulantly
after
all
that
was
his
only
justification
for
occupying
a
place
in
the
sun
he
does
have
much
sun
in
his
basement
the
footman
appeared
at
the
door
get
someone
to
put
all
these
things
back
in
their
places
lord
badgery
commanded
indicating
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
the
ravaged
cases
the
confusion
of
glass
and
china
with
which
he
had
littered
the
floor
the
pictures
unhooked
we
go
to
the
library
spode
it
more
comfortable
there
he
led
the
way
through
the
long
gallery
and
down
the
stairs
i
sorry
old
tillotson
has
been
such
a
disappointment
said
spode
sympathetically
let
us
talk
about
something
else
he
ceases
to
interest
me
but
do
you
think
we
ought
to
do
something
about
him
he
only
got
ten
pounds
between
him
and
the
workhouse
and
if
you
seen
the
in
his
basement
enough
enough
i
do
everything
you
think
fitting
i
thought
we
might
get
up
a
subscription
amongst
lovers
of
the
arts
there
are
any
said
badgery
no
but
there
are
plenty
of
people
who
will
subscribe
out
of
snobbism
not
unless
you
give
them
something
for
their
money
that
true
i
had
thought
of
that
spode
was
silent
for
a
moment
we
might
have
a
dinner
in
his
honour
the
great
tillotson
banquet
doyen
of
the
british
art
a
link
with
the
past
ca
you
see
it
in
the
papers
i
make
a
stunt
of
it
in
the
that
ought
to
bring
in
the
snobs
and
we
invite
a
lot
of
artists
and
critics
all
the
ones
who
stand
one
another
it
will
be
fun
to
see
them
squabbling
badgery
laughed
then
his
face
darkened
once
again
still
he
added
be
a
very
poor
second
best
to
my
frescoes
you
stay
to
dinner
of
course
well
since
you
suggest
it
thanks
very
much
iii
the
tillotson
banquet
was
fixed
to
take
place
about
three
weeks
later
spode
who
had
charge
of
the
arrangements
proved
himself
an
excellent
organiser
he
secured
the
big
at
the
café
bomba
and
was
successful
in
bullying
and
cajoling
the
manager
into
giving
fifty
persons
dinner
at
twelve
shillings
a
head
including
wine
he
sent
out
invitations
and
collected
subscriptions
he
wrote
an
article
on
tillotson
in
the
one
of
those
charming
witty
articles
couched
in
the
tone
of
amused
patronage
and
contempt
with
which
one
speaks
of
the
great
men
of
nor
did
he
neglect
tillotson
himself
he
used
to
go
to
holloway
almost
every
day
to
listen
to
the
old
endless
stories
about
asia
minor
and
the
great
exhibition
of
and
benjamin
robert
haydon
he
was
sincerely
sorry
for
this
relic
of
another
age
tillotson
room
was
about
ten
feet
below
the
level
of
the
soil
of
south
holloway
a
little
grey
light
percolated
through
the
area
bars
forced
a
difficult
passage
through
panes
opaque
with
dirt
and
spent
itself
like
a
drop
of
milk
that
falls
into
an
inkpot
among
the
inveterate
shadows
of
the
dungeon
the
place
was
haunted
by
the
spur
smell
of
damp
plaster
and
of
woodwork
that
has
begun
to
moulder
secretly
at
the
heart
a
little
miscellaneous
furniture
including
a
bed
a
washstand
and
chest
of
drawers
a
table
and
one
or
two
chairs
lurked
in
the
obscure
corners
of
the
den
or
ventured
furtively
out
into
the
open
hither
spode
now
came
almost
every
day
bringing
the
old
man
news
of
the
progress
of
the
banquet
scheme
every
day
he
found
tillotson
sitting
in
the
same
place
under
the
window
bathing
as
it
were
in
his
tiny
puddle
of
light
the
oldest
man
that
ever
wore
grey
hairs
spode
reflected
as
he
looked
at
him
only
there
were
very
few
hairs
left
on
that
bald
unpolished
head
at
the
sound
of
the
visitor
knock
tillotson
would
turn
in
his
chair
stare
in
the
direction
of
the
door
with
blinking
uncertain
eyes
he
was
always
full
of
apologies
for
being
so
slow
in
recognising
who
was
there
no
discourtesy
meant
he
would
say
after
asking
it
not
as
if
i
had
forgotten
who
you
were
only
it
so
dark
and
my
sight
is
what
it
was
after
that
he
never
failed
to
give
a
little
laugh
and
pointing
out
of
the
window
at
the
area
railings
would
say
ah
this
is
the
plate
for
somebody
with
good
sight
it
the
place
for
looking
at
ankles
it
the
grand
stand
it
was
the
day
before
the
great
event
spode
came
as
usual
and
tillotson
punctually
made
his
little
joke
about
the
ankles
and
spode
as
punctually
laughed
well
tillotson
he
said
after
the
reverberation
of
the
joke
had
died
away
you
make
your
into
the
world
of
art
and
fashion
you
find
some
changes
i
always
had
such
extraordinary
luck
said
tillotson
and
spode
could
see
by
his
expression
that
he
genuinely
believed
it
that
he
had
forgotten
the
black
hole
and
the
and
the
almost
exhausted
ten
pounds
that
stood
between
him
and
the
workhouse
what
an
amazing
piece
of
good
fortune
for
instance
that
you
should
have
found
me
just
when
you
did
now
this
dinner
will
bring
me
back
to
my
place
in
the
world
i
shall
have
money
and
in
a
little
while
who
knows
i
shall
be
able
to
see
well
enough
to
paint
again
i
believe
my
eyes
are
getting
better
you
know
ah
the
future
is
very
rosy
tillotson
looked
up
his
face
puckered
into
a
smile
and
nodded
his
head
in
affirmation
of
his
words
you
believe
in
the
life
to
come
said
spode
and
immediately
flushed
for
shame
at
the
cruelty
of
the
words
but
tillotson
was
in
far
too
cheerful
a
mood
to
have
caught
their
significance
life
to
come
he
repeated
no
i
do
believe
in
any
of
that
stuff
not
since
the
of
species
changed
my
views
you
know
no
life
to
come
for
me
thank
you
you
do
remember
the
excitement
of
course
you
re
very
young
mr
spode
well
i
not
so
old
as
i
was
spode
replied
you
know
how
one
is
as
a
schoolboy
and
undergraduate
now
i
old
enough
to
know
i
young
spode
was
about
to
develop
this
little
paradox
further
but
he
noticed
that
tillotson
had
not
been
listening
he
made
a
note
of
the
gambit
for
use
in
companies
that
were
more
appreciative
of
the
subtleties
you
were
talking
about
the
of
species
he
said
was
i
said
tillotson
waking
from
reverie
about
its
effect
on
your
faith
mr
tillotson
to
be
sure
yes
it
shattered
my
faith
but
i
remember
a
fine
thing
by
the
poet
laureate
something
about
there
being
more
faith
in
honest
doubt
believe
me
than
in
all
the
all
the
i
forget
exactly
what
but
you
see
the
train
of
thought
oh
it
was
a
bad
time
for
religion
i
am
glad
my
master
haydon
never
lived
to
see
it
he
was
a
man
of
fervour
i
remember
him
pacing
up
and
down
his
studio
in
lisson
grove
singing
and
shouting
and
praying
all
at
once
it
used
almost
to
frighten
me
oh
but
he
was
a
wonderful
man
a
great
man
take
him
for
all
in
all
we
shall
not
look
upon
his
like
again
as
usual
the
bard
is
right
but
it
was
all
very
long
ago
before
your
time
mr
spode
well
i
not
as
old
as
i
was
said
spode
in
the
hope
of
having
his
paradox
appreciated
this
time
but
tillotson
went
on
without
noticing
the
interruption
it
a
very
very
long
time
and
yet
when
i
look
back
on
it
it
all
seems
but
a
day
or
two
ago
strange
that
each
day
should
seem
so
long
and
that
many
days
added
together
should
be
less
than
an
hour
how
clearly
i
can
see
old
haydon
pacing
up
and
down
much
more
clearly
indeed
than
i
see
you
spode
the
eyes
of
memory
don
t
grow
dim
but
my
sight
is
improving
i
assure
you
it
improving
daily
i
shall
soon
be
able
to
see
those
ankles
he
laughed
like
a
cracked
bell
one
of
those
little
old
bells
spode
fancied
that
ring
with
much
rattling
of
wires
in
the
servants
quarters
of
ancient
houses
and
very
soon
tillotson
went
on
i
shall
be
painting
again
ah
spode
my
luck
is
extraordinary
i
believe
in
it
i
trust
in
it
and
after
all
what
is
luck
simply
another
name
for
providence
in
spite
of
the
origin
of
species
and
the
rest
of
it
how
right
the
laureate
was
when
he
said
that
there
was
more
faith
in
honest
doubt
believe
me
than
in
all
the
er
the
er
well
you
know
i
regard
you
spode
as
the
emissary
of
providence
your
coming
marked
a
in
my
life
and
the
beginning
for
me
of
happier
days
do
you
know
one
of
the
first
things
i
shall
do
when
my
fortunes
are
restored
will
be
to
buy
a
hedgehog
a
hedgehog
mr
tillotson
for
the
blackbeetles
there
nothing
like
a
hedgehog
for
beetles
it
will
eat
blackbeetles
till
it
sick
till
it
dies
of
surfeit
that
reminds
me
of
the
time
when
i
told
my
poor
great
master
haydon
in
joke
of
course
that
he
ought
to
send
in
a
cartoon
of
king
john
dying
of
a
surfeit
of
lampreys
for
the
frescoes
in
the
new
houses
of
parliament
as
i
told
him
it
a
most
notable
event
in
the
annals
of
british
liberty
the
providential
and
exemplary
removal
of
a
tyrant
tillotson
laughed
again
the
little
bell
in
the
deserted
house
a
ghostly
hand
pulling
the
cord
in
the
and
phantom
footmen
responding
to
the
thin
flawed
note
i
remember
he
laughed
laughed
like
a
bull
in
his
old
grand
manner
but
oh
it
was
a
terrible
blow
when
they
rejected
his
design
a
terrible
blow
it
was
the
first
and
fundamental
cause
of
his
suicide
tillotson
paused
there
was
a
long
silence
spode
felt
strangely
moved
he
hardly
knew
why
in
the
presence
of
this
man
so
frail
so
ancient
in
body
three
parts
dead
in
the
spirit
so
full
of
life
and
hopeful
patience
he
felt
ashamed
what
was
the
use
of
his
own
youth
and
cleverness
he
saw
himself
suddenly
as
a
boy
with
a
rattle
scaring
birds
rattling
his
noisy
cleverness
waving
his
arms
in
ceaseless
and
futile
activity
never
resting
in
his
efforts
to
scare
away
the
birds
that
were
always
trying
to
settle
in
his
mind
and
what
birds
widewinged
and
beautiful
all
those
serene
thoughts
and
faiths
and
emotions
that
only
visit
minds
that
have
humbled
themselves
to
quiet
those
gracious
visitants
he
was
for
ever
using
all
his
energies
to
drive
away
but
this
old
man
with
his
hedgehogs
and
his
honest
doubts
and
all
the
rest
of
it
his
mind
was
like
a
field
made
beautiful
by
the
free
coming
and
going
the
unafraid
alightings
of
a
multitude
of
white
creatures
he
felt
ashamed
but
then
was
it
possible
to
alter
life
was
it
a
little
absurd
to
risk
a
conversion
spode
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
get
you
a
hedgehog
at
once
he
said
they
sure
to
have
some
at
whiteley
before
he
left
that
evening
spode
made
an
alarming
discovery
tillotson
did
not
possess
a
it
was
hopeless
to
think
of
getting
one
made
at
this
short
notice
and
besides
what
an
unnecessary
expense
we
shall
have
to
borrow
a
suit
tillotson
i
ought
to
have
thought
of
that
before
dear
me
dear
me
tillotson
was
a
little
chagrined
by
this
unlucky
discovery
borrow
a
suit
spode
hurried
away
for
counsel
to
badgery
house
lord
badgery
surprisingly
rose
to
the
occasion
ask
boreham
to
come
and
see
me
he
told
the
footman
who
answered
his
ring
boreham
was
one
of
those
immemorial
butlers
who
linger
on
generation
after
generation
in
the
houses
of
the
great
he
was
over
eighty
now
bent
dried
up
shrivelled
with
age
all
old
men
are
about
the
same
size
said
lord
badgery
it
was
a
comforting
theory
ah
here
he
is
have
you
got
a
spare
suit
of
evening
clothes
boreham
i
have
an
old
suit
my
lord
that
i
stopped
wearing
in
let
me
see
was
it
nineteen
seven
or
eight
that
the
very
thing
i
should
be
most
grateful
boreham
if
you
could
lend
it
to
me
for
spode
here
for
a
day
the
old
man
went
out
and
soon
reappeared
carrying
over
his
arm
a
very
old
black
suit
he
held
up
the
coat
and
trousers
for
inspection
in
the
light
of
day
they
were
deplorable
you
no
idea
sir
said
boreham
deprecatingly
to
spode
you
no
idea
how
easy
things
get
stained
with
grease
and
gravy
and
what
not
however
careful
you
are
sir
however
careful
i
should
imagine
so
spode
was
sympathetic
however
careful
sir
but
in
artificial
light
they
look
all
right
perfectly
all
right
lord
badgery
repeated
thank
you
boreham
you
shall
have
them
back
on
thursday
you
re
welcome
my
lord
i
sure
and
the
old
man
bowed
and
disappeared
on
the
afternoon
of
the
great
day
spode
carried
up
to
holloway
a
parcel
containing
boreham
retired
and
all
the
necessary
appurtenances
in
the
way
of
shirts
and
collars
owing
to
the
darkness
and
his
own
feeble
sight
tillotson
was
happily
unaware
of
the
defects
in
the
suit
he
was
in
a
state
of
extreme
nervous
agitation
it
was
with
some
difficulty
that
spode
could
prevent
him
although
it
was
only
three
from
starting
his
toilet
on
the
spot
take
it
easy
tillotson
take
it
easy
we
need
start
till
seven
you
know
spode
left
an
hour
later
and
as
soon
as
he
was
safely
out
of
the
room
tillotson
began
to
prepare
himself
for
the
banquet
he
lighted
the
gas
and
a
couple
of
candles
and
blinking
myopically
at
the
image
that
fronted
him
in
the
tiny
that
stood
on
his
chest
of
drawers
he
set
to
work
with
all
the
ardour
of
a
young
girl
preparing
for
her
first
ball
at
six
when
the
last
touches
had
been
given
he
was
not
unsatisfied
he
marched
up
and
down
his
cellar
humming
to
himself
the
gay
song
which
had
been
so
popular
in
his
middle
years
oh
anna
maria
jones
of
the
tambourine
the
cymbals
and
the
bones
spode
arrived
an
hour
later
in
lord
badgery
second
opening
the
door
of
the
old
man
dungeon
he
stood
for
a
moment
with
astonishment
on
the
threshold
tillotson
was
standing
by
the
empty
grate
one
elbow
resting
on
the
mantelpiece
one
leg
crossed
over
the
other
in
a
jaunty
and
gentlemanly
attitude
the
effect
of
the
candlelight
shining
on
his
face
was
to
deepen
every
line
and
wrinkle
with
intense
black
shadow
he
looked
immeasurably
old
it
was
a
noble
and
pathetic
head
on
the
other
hand
boreham
was
simply
buffoonish
the
coat
was
too
long
in
the
sleeves
and
the
tail
the
trousers
bagged
in
elephantine
creases
about
his
ankles
some
of
the
were
visible
even
in
candlelight
the
white
tie
over
which
tillotson
had
taken
infinite
pains
and
which
he
believed
in
his
purblindness
to
be
perfect
was
fantastically
he
had
buttoned
up
his
waistcoat
in
such
a
fashion
that
one
button
was
widowed
of
its
hole
and
one
hole
of
its
button
across
his
shirt
front
lay
the
broad
green
ribbon
of
some
unknown
order
queen
of
the
tambourine
the
cymbals
and
the
bones
tillotson
concluded
in
a
voice
before
welcoming
his
visitor
well
spode
here
you
are
i
dressed
already
you
see
the
suit
i
flatter
myself
fits
very
well
almost
as
though
it
had
been
made
for
me
i
am
all
gratitude
to
the
gentleman
who
was
kind
enough
to
lend
it
to
me
i
shall
take
the
greatest
care
of
it
it
a
dangerous
thing
to
lend
clothes
for
loan
oft
loseth
both
itself
and
friend
the
bard
is
always
right
just
one
thing
said
spode
a
touch
to
your
waistcoat
he
unbuttoned
the
dissipated
garment
and
did
it
up
again
more
symmetrically
tillotson
was
a
little
piqued
at
being
found
so
absurdly
in
the
wrong
thanks
thanks
he
said
protestingly
trying
to
edge
away
from
his
valet
it
all
right
you
know
i
can
do
it
myself
foolish
oversight
i
flatter
myself
the
suit
fits
very
well
and
perhaps
the
tie
might
spode
began
tentatively
but
the
old
man
would
not
hear
of
it
no
no
the
tie
all
right
i
can
tie
a
tie
spode
the
tie
all
right
leave
it
as
it
is
i
beg
i
like
your
order
tillotson
looked
down
complacently
at
his
shirt
front
ah
noticed
my
order
it
a
long
time
since
i
wore
that
it
was
given
me
by
the
grand
porte
you
know
for
services
rendered
in
the
war
it
the
order
of
chastity
the
second
class
they
only
give
the
first
class
to
crowned
heads
you
know
browned
heads
and
ambassadors
and
only
pashas
of
the
highest
rank
get
the
second
mine
the
second
they
only
give
the
first
class
to
crowned
heads
of
course
of
course
said
spode
do
you
think
i
look
all
right
mr
spode
tillotson
asked
a
little
anxiously
splendid
tillotson
splendid
the
order
magnificent
the
old
man
face
brightened
once
more
i
flatter
myself
he
said
that
this
borrowed
suit
fits
me
very
well
but
i
do
like
borrowing
clothes
for
loan
oft
loseth
both
itself
and
friend
you
know
and
the
bard
is
always
right
ugh
there
one
of
those
horrible
beetles
spode
exclaimed
tillotson
bent
down
and
stared
at
the
floor
i
see
it
he
said
and
stamped
on
a
small
piece
of
coal
which
crunched
to
powder
under
his
foot
i
shall
certainly
buy
a
hedgehog
it
was
time
for
them
to
start
a
crowd
of
little
boys
and
girls
had
collected
round
lord
badgery
enormous
car
the
chauffeur
who
felt
that
honour
and
dignity
were
at
stake
pretended
not
to
notice
the
children
but
sat
gazing
like
a
statue
into
eternity
at
the
sight
of
spode
and
tillotson
emerging
from
the
house
a
yell
of
mingled
awe
and
derision
went
up
it
subsided
to
an
astonished
silence
as
they
climbed
into
the
car
bomba
spode
directed
the
gave
a
faintly
stertorous
sigh
and
began
to
move
the
children
yelled
again
and
ran
along
beside
the
car
waving
their
arms
in
a
frenzy
of
excitement
it
was
then
that
tillotson
with
an
incomparably
noble
gesture
leaned
forward
and
tossed
among
the
seething
crowd
of
urchins
his
three
last
coppers
iv
in
bomba
big
room
the
company
was
assembling
the
long
mirrors
reflected
a
singular
collection
of
people
academicians
shot
suspicious
glances
at
youths
whom
they
suspected
only
too
correctly
of
being
iconoclasts
organisers
of
exhibitions
rival
art
critics
brought
suddenly
face
to
face
quivered
with
restrained
hatred
nobes
cayman
and
mandragore
those
indefatigable
hunters
of
artistic
big
game
came
on
one
another
all
unawares
in
this
menagerie
where
each
had
expected
to
hunt
alone
and
were
filled
with
rage
through
this
crowd
of
mutually
repellent
vanities
lord
badgery
moved
with
a
suavity
that
seemed
unconscious
of
all
the
feuds
and
hatreds
he
was
enjoying
himself
immensely
behind
the
heavy
waxen
mask
of
his
face
ambushed
behind
the
hanoverian
nose
the
little
lustreless
pig
eyes
the
pale
thick
lips
there
lurked
a
small
devil
of
happy
malice
that
rocked
with
laughter
so
nice
of
you
to
have
come
mandragore
to
do
honour
to
artistic
past
and
i
so
glad
to
see
you
brought
dear
cayman
and
is
that
nobes
too
so
it
is
i
had
noticed
her
before
how
delightful
i
knew
we
could
depend
on
your
love
of
art
and
he
hurried
away
to
seize
the
opportunity
of
introducing
that
eminent
sculptor
sir
herbert
herne
to
the
bright
young
critic
who
had
called
him
in
the
public
prints
a
monumental
mason
a
moment
later
the
maître
came
to
the
door
of
the
gilded
saloon
and
announced
loudly
and
impressively
walter
tillotson
guided
from
behind
by
young
spode
tillotson
came
into
the
room
slowly
and
hesitatingly
in
the
glare
of
the
lights
his
eyelids
beat
heavily
painfully
like
the
wings
of
an
imprisoned
moth
over
his
filmy
eyes
once
inside
the
door
he
halted
and
drew
himself
up
with
a
conscious
assumption
of
dignity
lord
badgery
hurried
forward
and
seized
his
hand
welcome
tillotson
welcome
in
the
name
of
english
art
tillotson
inclined
his
head
in
silence
he
was
too
full
of
emotion
to
be
able
to
reply
i
should
like
to
introduce
you
to
a
few
of
your
younger
colleagues
who
have
assembled
here
to
do
you
honour
lord
badgery
presented
everyone
in
the
room
to
the
old
painter
who
bowed
shook
hands
made
little
noises
in
his
throat
but
still
found
himself
unable
to
speak
nobes
cayman
and
mandragore
all
said
charming
things
dinner
was
served
the
party
took
their
places
lord
badgery
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
with
tillotson
on
his
right
hand
and
sir
herbert
herne
on
his
left
confronted
with
bomba
succulent
cooking
and
wines
tillotson
ate
and
drank
a
good
deal
he
had
the
appetite
of
one
who
has
lived
on
greens
and
potatoes
for
ten
years
among
the
blackbeetles
after
the
second
glass
of
wine
he
began
to
talk
suddenly
and
in
a
flood
as
though
a
sluice
had
been
pulled
up
in
asia
minor
he
began
it
is
the
custom
when
one
goes
to
dinner
to
hiccough
as
a
sign
of
appreciative
fullness
cor
as
the
psalmist
has
it
he
was
an
oriental
himself
spode
had
arranged
to
sit
next
to
cayman
he
had
designs
upon
her
she
was
an
impossible
woman
of
course
but
rich
and
useful
he
wanted
to
bamboozle
her
into
buying
some
of
his
young
friends
pictures
in
a
cellar
cayman
was
saying
with
blackbeetles
oh
how
dreadful
poor
old
man
and
he
did
you
say
that
shocking
i
only
hope
the
subscription
will
be
a
large
one
of
course
one
wishes
one
could
have
given
more
oneself
but
then
you
know
one
has
so
many
expenses
and
things
are
so
difficult
now
i
know
i
know
said
spode
with
feeling
it
all
because
of
labour
cayman
explained
of
course
i
should
simply
love
to
have
him
in
to
dinner
sometimes
but
then
i
feel
he
really
too
old
too
and
it
would
not
be
doing
a
kindness
to
him
would
it
and
so
you
are
working
with
gollamy
now
what
a
charming
man
so
talented
such
conversation
cor
said
tillotson
for
the
third
time
lord
badgery
tried
to
head
him
off
the
subject
of
turkish
etiquette
but
in
vain
by
nine
a
kinder
vinolent
atmosphere
had
put
to
sleep
the
hatreds
and
suspicions
of
before
dinner
sir
herbert
herne
had
discovered
that
the
young
cubist
sitting
next
him
was
not
insane
and
actually
knew
a
surprising
amount
about
the
old
masters
for
their
part
these
young
men
had
realised
that
their
elders
were
not
at
all
malignant
they
were
just
very
stupid
and
pathetic
it
was
only
in
the
bosoms
of
nobes
cayman
and
mandragore
that
hatred
still
reigned
undiminished
being
ladies
and
they
had
drunk
almost
no
wine
the
moment
for
arrived
lord
badgery
rose
to
his
feet
said
what
was
expected
of
him
and
called
upon
sir
herbert
to
propose
the
toast
of
the
evening
sir
herbert
coughed
smiled
and
began
in
the
course
of
a
speech
that
lasted
twenty
minutes
he
told
anecdotes
of
gladstone
lord
leighton
sir
almo
tadema
and
the
late
bishop
of
bombay
he
made
three
puns
he
quoted
shakespeare
and
whittier
he
was
playful
he
was
eloquent
he
was
grave
at
the
end
of
his
harangue
sir
herbert
handed
to
tillotson
a
silk
purse
containing
pounds
ten
shillings
the
total
amount
of
the
subscription
the
old
man
health
was
drunk
with
acclamation
tillotson
rose
with
difficulty
to
his
feet
the
dry
snakelike
skin
of
his
face
was
flushed
his
tie
was
more
crooked
than
ever
the
green
ribbon
of
the
order
of
chastity
of
the
second
class
had
somehow
climbed
tip
his
crumpled
and
maculate
shirt
front
my
lords
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
began
in
a
choking
voice
and
then
broke
down
completely
it
was
a
very
painful
and
pathetic
spectacle
a
feeling
of
intense
discomfort
afflicted
the
minds
of
all
who
looked
upon
that
trembling
relic
of
a
man
as
he
stood
there
weeping
and
stammering
it
was
as
though
a
breath
of
the
wind
of
death
had
blown
suddenly
through
the
room
lifting
the
vapours
of
wine
and
quenching
the
laughter
and
the
candle
flames
eyes
floated
uneasily
not
knowing
where
to
look
lord
badgery
with
great
presence
of
mind
offered
the
old
man
a
glass
of
wine
tillotson
began
to
recover
the
guests
heard
him
murmur
a
few
disconnected
words
this
great
honour
overwhelmed
with
kindness
this
magnificent
banquet
not
used
to
it
in
asia
minor
cor
at
this
point
lord
badgery
plucked
sharply
at
one
of
his
long
coat
tails
tillotson
paused
took
another
sip
of
wine
and
then
went
on
with
a
newly
won
coherence
and
energy
the
life
of
the
artist
is
a
hard
one
his
work
is
unlike
other
work
which
may
be
done
mechanically
by
rote
and
almost
as
it
were
in
sleep
it
demands
from
him
a
constant
expense
of
spirit
he
gives
continually
of
his
best
life
and
in
return
he
receives
much
joy
it
is
true
much
fame
it
may
be
but
of
material
blessings
very
few
it
is
eighty
years
since
first
i
devoted
my
life
to
the
service
of
art
eighty
years
and
almost
every
one
of
those
years
has
brought
me
fresh
and
painful
proof
of
what
i
have
been
saying
the
artist
life
is
a
hard
one
this
unexpected
deviation
into
sense
increased
the
general
feeling
of
discomfort
it
became
necessary
to
take
the
old
man
seriously
to
regard
him
as
a
human
being
up
till
then
he
had
been
no
more
than
an
object
of
curiosity
a
mummy
in
an
absurd
suit
of
with
a
green
ribbon
across
the
shirt
front
people
could
not
help
wishing
that
they
had
subscribed
a
little
more
pounds
ten
it
was
enormous
but
happily
for
the
peace
of
mind
of
the
company
tillotson
paused
again
took
another
sip
of
wine
and
began
to
live
up
to
his
proper
character
by
talking
absurdly
when
i
consider
the
life
of
that
great
man
benjamin
robert
haydon
one
of
the
greatest
men
england
has
ever
produced
the
audience
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
this
was
all
as
it
should
be
there
was
a
burst
of
loud
bravoing
and
clapping
tillotson
turned
his
dim
eyes
round
the
room
and
smiled
gratefully
at
the
misty
figures
he
beheld
that
great
man
benjamin
robert
haydon
he
continued
whom
i
am
proud
to
call
my
master
and
who
it
rejoices
my
heart
to
see
still
lives
in
your
memory
and
esteem
that
great
man
one
of
the
greatest
that
england
has
ever
produced
led
a
life
so
deplorable
that
i
can
not
think
of
it
without
a
tear
and
with
infinite
repetitions
and
divagations
tillotson
related
the
history
of
haydon
his
imprisonments
for
debt
his
battle
with
the
academy
his
triumphs
his
failures
his
despair
his
suicide
ten
struck
tillotson
was
declaiming
against
the
stupid
and
prejudiced
judges
who
had
rejected
haydon
designs
for
the
decoration
of
the
new
houses
of
parliament
in
favour
of
the
paltriest
german
scribblings
that
great
man
one
of
the
greatest
england
has
ever
produced
that
great
benjamin
robert
haydon
whom
i
am
proud
to
call
my
master
and
who
it
rejoices
me
to
see
still
lives
on
in
your
memory
and
esteem
at
that
affront
his
great
heart
burst
it
was
the
unkindest
cut
of
all
he
who
had
worked
all
his
life
for
the
recognition
of
the
artist
by
the
state
he
who
had
petitioned
every
prime
minister
including
the
duke
of
wellington
for
thirty
years
begging
them
to
employ
artists
to
decorate
public
buildings
he
to
whom
the
scheme
for
decorating
the
houses
of
parliament
was
undeniably
due
tillotson
lost
a
grip
on
his
syntax
and
began
a
new
sentence
it
was
the
unkindest
cut
of
all
it
was
the
last
straw
the
artist
life
is
a
hard
one
at
eleven
tillotson
was
talking
about
the
at
a
quarter
past
he
had
begun
to
tell
the
story
of
haydon
all
over
again
at
minutes
to
twelve
he
collapsed
quite
speechless
into
his
chair
most
of
the
guests
had
already
gone
away
the
few
who
remained
made
haste
to
depart
lord
badgery
led
the
old
man
to
the
door
and
packed
him
into
the
second
the
tillotson
banquet
was
over
it
had
been
a
pleasant
evening
but
a
little
too
long
spode
walked
back
to
his
rooms
in
bloomsbury
whistling
as
he
went
the
arc
lamps
of
oxford
street
reflected
in
the
polished
surface
of
the
road
canals
of
dark
bronze
he
would
have
to
bring
that
into
an
article
some
time
the
cayman
woman
had
been
very
successfully
nobbled
voi
che
sapete
he
whistled
somewhat
out
of
tune
but
he
could
not
hear
that
when
tillotson
landlady
came
in
to
call
him
on
the
following
morning
she
found
the
old
man
lying
fully
dressed
on
his
bed
he
looked
very
ill
and
very
very
old
boreham
was
in
a
terrible
state
and
the
green
ribbon
of
the
order
of
chastity
was
ruined
tillotson
lay
very
still
but
he
was
not
asleep
hearing
the
sound
of
footsteps
he
opened
his
eyes
a
little
and
faintly
groaned
his
landlady
looked
down
at
him
menacingly
disgusting
she
said
disgusting
i
call
it
at

tillotson
groaned
again
making
a
great
effort
he
drew
out
of
his
trouser
pocket
a
large
silk
purse
opened
it
and
extracted
a
sovereign
the
artist
life
is
a
hard
one
green
he
said
handing
her
the
coin
would
you
mind
sending
for
the
doctor
i
do
feel
very
well
and
oh
what
shall
i
do
about
these
clothes
what
shall
i
say
to
the

who
was
kind
enough
to
lend
them
to
me

iv
green
tunnels
in
the
italian
gardens
of
the
thirteenth
century
buzzacott
interrupted
himself
to
take
another
helping
of
the
risotto
which
was
being
offered
him
excellent
risotto
this
he
observed
nobody
who
was
not
born
in
milan
can
make
it
properly
so
they
say
so
they
say
topes
repeated
in
his
sad
apologetic
voice
and
helped
himself
in
his
turn
personally
said
topes
with
decision
i
find
all
italian
cooking
abominable
i
do
like
the
oil
especially
hot
no
thank
you
she
recoiled
from
the
proffered
dish
after
the
first
mouthful
buzzacott
put
down
his
fork
in
the
italian
gardens
of
the
thirteenth
century
he
began
again
making
with
his
long
pale
hand
a
curved
and
flowery
gesture
that
ended
with
a
clutch
at
his
beard
a
frequent
and
most
felicitous
use
was
made
of
green
tunnels
green
tunnels
barbara
woke
up
suddenly
from
her
tranced
silence
green
tunnels
yes
my
dear
said
her
father
green
tunnels
arched
alleys
covered
with
vines
or
other
creeping
plants
their
length
was
often
very
considerable
but
barbara
had
once
more
ceased
to
pay
attention
to
what
he
was
saying
green
tunnels
the
word
had
floated
down
to
her
through
profound
depths
of
reverie
across
great
spaces
of
abstraction
startling
her
like
the
sound
of
a
bell
green
tunnels
what
a
wonderful
idea
she
would
not
listen
to
her
father
explaining
the
phrase
into
dullness
he
made
everything
dull
an
inverted
alchemist
turning
gold
into
lead
she
pictured
caverns
in
a
great
aquarium
long
vistas
between
rocks
and
scarcely
swaying
weeds
and
pale
discoloured
corals
endless
dim
green
corridors
with
huge
lazy
fishes
loitering
aimlessly
along
them
monsters
with
goggling
eyes
and
mouths
that
slowly
opened
and
shut
green
tunnels
i
have
seen
them
illustrated
in
illuminated
manuscripts
of
the
period
buzzacott
went
on
once
more
he
clutched
his
pointed
brown
beard
clutched
and
combed
it
with
his
long
fingers
topes
looked
up
the
glasses
of
his
round
owlish
spectacles
flashed
as
he
moved
his
head
i
know
what
you
mean
he
said
i
have
a
very
good
mind
to
have
one
planted
in
my
garden
here
it
will
take
a
long
time
to
grow
said
topes
in
this
sand
so
close
to
the
sea
you
will
only
be
able
to
plant
vines
and
they
come
up
very
slowly
very
slowly
indeed
he
shook
his
head
and
the
points
of
light
danced
wildly
in
his
spectacles
his
voice
drooped
hopelessly
his
grey
moustache
drooped
his
whole
person
drooped
then
suddenly
he
pulled
himself
up
a
shy
apologetic
smile
appeared
on
his
face
he
wriggled
uncomfortably
then
with
a
final
rapid
shake
of
the
head
he
gave
vent
to
a
quotation
at
my
back
i
always
winged
chariot
hurrying
he
spoke
deliberately
and
his
voice
trembled
a
little
he
always
found
it
painfully
difficult
to
say
something
choice
and
out
of
the
ordinary
and
yet
what
a
wealth
of
remembered
phrase
what
apt
new
coinages
were
always
surging
through
his
mind
they
do
grow
so
slowly
as
all
that
said
buzzacott
confidently
he
was
only
just
over
fifty
and
looked
a
handsome
he
gave
himself
at
least
another
forty
years
indeed
he
had
not
yet
begun
to
contemplate
the
possibility
of
ever
concluding
miss
barbara
will
enjoy
it
perhaps
your
green
tunnel
topes
sighed
and
looked
across
the
table
at
his
host
daughter
barbara
was
sitting
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
her
chin
in
her
hands
staring
in
front
of
her
the
sound
of
her
own
name
reached
her
faintly
she
turned
her
head
in
topes
direction
and
found
herself
confronted
by
the
glitter
of
his
round
convex
spectacles
at
the
end
of
the
green
tunnel
she
stared
at
the
shining
circles
hung
the
eyes
of
a
goggling
fish
they
approached
floating
closer
and
closer
along
the
dim
submarine
corridor
confronted
by
this
fixed
regard
topes
looked
away
what
thoughtful
eyes
he
could
remember
ever
to
have
seen
eyes
so
full
of
thought
there
were
certain
madonnas
of
montagna
he
reflected
very
like
hen
mild
little
blonde
madonnas
with
slightly
snub
noses
and
very
very
young
but
he
was
old
it
would
be
many
years
in
spite
of
buzzacott
before
the
vines
grew
up
into
a
green
tunnel
he
took
a
sip
of
wine
then
mechanically
sucked
his
drooping
grey
moustache
arthur
at
the
sound
of
his
wife
voice
topes
started
raised
his
napkin
to
his
mouth
topes
did
not
permit
the
sucking
of
moustaches
it
was
only
in
moments
of
that
he
ever
offended
now
the
marchese
prampolini
is
coming
here
to
take
coffee
said
buzzacott
suddenly
i
almost
forgot
to
tell
you
one
of
these
italian
marquises
i
suppose
said
topes
who
was
no
snob
except
in
england
she
raised
her
chin
with
a
little
jerk
buzzacott
executed
an
upward
curve
of
the
hand
in
her
direction
i
assure
you
topes
he
belongs
to
a
very
old
and
distinguished
family
they
are
genoese
in
origin
you
remember
their
palace
barbara
built
by
alessi
barbara
looked
up
oh
yes
she
said
vaguely
alessi
i
know
alessi
aleppo
where
a
malignant
and
a
turbaned
turk
a
turbaned
that
had
always
seemed
to
her
very
funny
several
of
his
ancestors
buzzacott
went
on
distinguished
themselves
as
of
corsica
they
did
good
work
in
the
suppression
of
rebellion
strange
is
it
he
turned
parenthetically
to
topes
the
way
in
which
sympathy
is
always
on
the
side
of
rebels
what
a
fuss
people
made
of
corsica
that
ridiculous
book
of
gregorovius
for
example
and
the
irish
and
the
poles
and
all
the
rest
of
them
it
always
seems
to
me
very
superfluous
and
absurd
is
it
perhaps
a
little
natural
topes
began
timorously
and
tentatively
but
his
host
went
on
without
listening
the
present
marquis
he
said
is
the
head
of
the
local
fascisti
they
have
done
no
end
of
good
work
in
this
district
in
the
way
of
preserving
law
and
order
and
keeping
the
lower
classes
in
their
place
ah
the
fascisti
topes
repeated
approvingly
one
would
like
to
see
something
of
the
kind
in
england
what
with
all
these
strikes
he
has
asked
me
for
a
subscription
to
the
funds
of
the
organisation
i
shall
give
him
one
of
course
of
course
topes
nodded
my
nephew
the
one
who
was
a
major
during
the
war
volunteered
in
the
last
coal
strike
he
was
sorry
i
know
that
it
did
come
to
a
fight
annie
he
said
to
me
when
i
saw
him
last
there
had
been
a
fight
we
should
have
knocked
them
out
completely
completely
in
aleppo
the
fascisti
malignant
turbaned
were
fighting
under
the
palm
trees
were
they
palm
trees
those
tufted
green
plumes
what
no
ice
gelato
inquired
buzzacott
as
the
maid
put
down
the
compote
of
peaches
on
the
table
concetta
apologised
the
machine
in
the
village
had
broken
down
there
would
be
no
ice
till
too
bad
said
buzzacott
male
under
the
palm
trees
barbara
saw
them
they
pranced
about
fighting
they
were
mounted
on
big
dogs
and
in
the
trees
were
enormous
birds
goodness
me
the
child
asleep
topes
was
proffering
the
dish
of
peaches
how
much
longer
am
i
to
hold
this
in
front
of
your
nose
barbara
barbara
felt
herself
blushing
i
so
sorry
she
mumbled
and
took
the
dish
clumsily
it
a
bad
habit
it
one
we
all
succumb
to
sometimes
put
in
topes
deprecatingly
with
a
little
nervous
tremble
of
the
head
you
may
my
dear
said
his
wife
i
do
not
topes
lowered
his
eyes
to
his
plate
and
went
on
eating
the
marchese
should
be
here
at
any
moment
now
said
buzzacott
looking
at
his
watch
i
hope
he
wo
be
late
i
find
i
suffer
so
much
from
any
postponement
of
my
siesta
this
italian
heat
he
added
with
growing
plaintiveness
one
ca
be
too
careful
ah
but
when
i
was
with
my
father
in
india
began
topes
in
a
tone
of
superiority
he
was
an
indian
civilian
you
know
aleppo
india
always
the
palm
trees
cavalcades
of
big
dogs
and
tigers
too
concetta
ushered
in
the
marquis
delighted
pleased
to
meet
speak
english
yés
yéss
topes
and
topes
the
distinguished
antiquarian
ah
of
course
know
his
name
very
well
my
daughter
charmed
often
seen
the
signorina
bathing
admired
the
way
she
dives
beautiful
the
hand
made
a
long
caressing
gesture
these
athletic
english
signorine
the
teeth
flashed
astonishingly
white
in
the
brown
face
the
dark
eyes
glittered
she
felt
herself
blushing
again
looked
away
smiled
foolishly
the
marquis
had
already
turned
back
to
buzzacott
so
you
have
decided
to
settle
in
our
carrarese
well
not
settled
exactly
buzzacott
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
settled
a
villine
for
the
summer
months
the
winter
in
rome
one
was
forced
to
live
abroad
taxation
in
england
soon
they
were
all
talking
barbara
looked
at
them
beside
the
marquis
they
all
seemed
half
dead
his
face
flashed
as
he
talked
he
seemed
to
be
boiling
with
life
her
father
was
limp
and
pale
like
something
long
buried
from
the
light
and
topes
was
all
dry
and
shrivelled
and
topes
looked
more
than
ever
like
something
worked
by
clockwork
they
were
talking
about
socialism
and
fascisti
and
all
that
barbara
did
not
listen
to
what
they
were
saying
but
she
looked
at
them
absorbed
the
animated
face
with
its
flash
of
a
smile
was
turned
like
a
lamp
from
one
to
another
now
it
was
turned
on
her
perhaps
one
evening
she
would
come
with
her
father
and
the
signora
topes
he
and
his
sister
gave
little
dances
sometimes
only
the
gramophone
of
course
but
that
was
better
than
nothing
and
the
signorina
must
dance
divinely
another
flash
he
could
see
that
he
pressed
her
hand
again
it
was
time
for
the
siesta
do
forget
to
pull
down
the
mosquito
netting
my
dear
buzzacott
exhorted
there
is
always
a
danger
of
anophylines
all
right
father
she
moved
towards
the
door
without
turning
round
to
answer
him
he
was
always
terribly
tiresome
about
mosquito
nets
once
they
had
driven
through
the
campagna
in
a
hired
cab
completely
enclosed
in
an
improvised
tent
of
netting
the
monuments
along
the
appian
way
had
loomed
up
mistily
as
through
bridal
veils
and
how
everyone
had
laughed
but
her
father
of
course
had
so
much
as
noticed
it
he
never
noticed
anything
is
it
at
berlin
that
charming
little
madonna
of
montagna
topes
abruptly
asked
the
one
with
the
donor
kneeling
in
the
corner
as
if
about
to
kiss
the
foot
of
the
child
his
spectacles
flashed
in
buzzacott
direction
why
do
you
ask
i
do
know
i
was
just
thinking
of
it
i
think
you
must
mean
the
one
in
the
mond
collection
ah
yes
very
probably
in
the
mond
barbara
opened
the
door
and
walked
into
the
twilight
of
her
shuttered
room
it
was
hot
even
here
for
another
three
hours
it
would
hardly
be
possible
to
stir
and
that
old
idiot
topes
always
made
a
fuss
if
one
came
in
to
lunch
with
bare
legs
and
one
tunic
in
india
we
always
made
a
point
of
being
properly
and
adequately
dressed
an
englishwoman
must
keep
up
her
position
with
natives
and
to
all
intents
and
purposes
italians
natives
and
so
she
always
had
to
put
on
shoes
and
stockings
and
a
regular
frock
just
at
the
hottest
hour
of
the
day
what
an
old
ass
that
woman
was
she
slipped
off
her
clothes
as
fast
as
she
could
that
was
a
little
better
standing
in
front
of
the
long
mirror
in
the
wardrobe
door
she
came
to
the
humiliating
conclusion
that
she
looked
like
a
piece
of
badly
toasted
bread
brown
face
brown
neck
and
shoulders
brown
arms
brown
legs
from
the
knee
downwards
but
all
the
rest
of
her
was
white
silly
effeminate
townish
white
if
only
one
could
run
about
with
no
clothes
on
till
one
was
like
those
little
coppery
children
who
rolled
and
tumbled
in
the
burning
sand
now
she
was
just
underdone
and
wholly
ridiculous
for
a
long
time
she
looked
at
her
pale
image
she
saw
herself
running
bronzed
all
over
along
the
sand
or
through
a
field
of
flowers
narcissus
and
wild
tulips
or
in
soft
grass
under
grey
olive
trees
she
turned
round
with
a
sudden
start
there
in
the
shadows
behind
her
no
of
course
there
was
nothing
it
was
that
awful
picture
in
a
magazine
she
had
looked
at
so
many
years
ago
when
she
was
a
child
there
was
a
lady
sitting
at
her
doing
her
hair
in
front
of
the
glass
and
a
huge
hairy
black
monkey
creeping
up
behind
her
she
always
got
the
creeps
when
she
looked
at
herself
in
a
mirror
it
was
very
silly
but
still
she
turned
away
from
the
mirror
crossed
the
room
and
without
lowering
the
mosquito
curtains
lay
down
on
her
bed
the
flies
buzzed
about
her
settled
incessantly
on
her
face
she
shook
her
head
flapped
at
them
angrily
with
her
hands
there
would
be
peace
if
she
let
down
the
netting
but
she
thought
of
the
appian
way
seen
mistily
through
the
bridal
veil
and
preferred
to
suffer
the
flies
in
the
end
she
had
to
surrender
the
brutes
were
too
much
for
her
but
at
any
rate
it
the
fear
of
anophylines
that
made
her
lower
the
netting
undisturbed
now
and
motionless
she
lay
stretched
stiffly
out
under
the
transparent
bell
of
gauze
a
specimen
under
a
glass
case
the
fancy
possessed
her
mind
she
saw
a
huge
museum
with
thousands
of
glass
cases
full
of
fossils
and
butterflies
and
stuffed
birds
and
mediæval
spoons
and
armour
and
florentine
jewellery
and
mummies
and
carved
ivory
and
illuminated
manuscripts
but
in
one
of
the
cases
was
a
human
being
shut
up
there
alive
all
of
a
sudden
she
became
horribly
miserable
boring
boring
boring
she
whispered
formulating
the
words
aloud
would
it
never
stop
being
boring
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
how
awful
everything
was
and
perhaps
it
would
go
on
being
as
bad
as
this
all
her
life
seventeen
from
seventy
was
fifty
three
fifty
three
years
of
it
and
if
she
lived
to
a
hundred
there
would
be
more
than
eighty
the
thought
depressed
her
all
the
evening
even
her
bath
after
tea
did
her
no
good
swimming
far
out
far
out
she
lay
there
floating
on
the
warm
water
sometimes
she
looked
at
the
sky
sometimes
she
turned
her
head
towards
the
shore
framed
in
their
pinewoods
the
villas
looked
as
small
and
smug
as
the
advertisement
of
a
seaside
resort
but
behind
them
across
the
level
plain
were
the
mountains
sharp
bare
peaks
of
limestone
green
woodland
slopes
and
expanses
of
terraced
olive
trees
they
seemed
marvellously
close
and
clear
in
this
evening
light
and
beautiful
beautiful
beyond
words
but
that
somehow
only
made
things
worse
and
shelley
had
lived
a
few
miles
farther
up
the
coast
there
behind
the
headland
guarding
the
gulf
of
spezia
shelley
had
been
drowned
in
this
sea
that
made
it
worse
too
the
sun
was
getting
very
low
and
red
over
the
sea
she
swam
slowly
in
on
the
beach
topes
waited
disapprovingly
she
had
known
somebody
a
strong
man
who
had
caught
cramp
from
staying
in
too
long
he
sank
like
a
stone
like
a
stone
the
queer
people
topes
had
known
and
the
funny
things
they
did
the
odd
things
that
happened
to
them
dinner
that
evening
was
duller
than
ever
barbara
went
early
to
bed
all
night
long
the
same
old
irritating
cicada
scraped
and
scraped
among
the
pine
trees
monotonous
and
regular
as
clockwork
zip
zip
zip
zip
zip
boring
boring
was
the
animal
never
bored
by
its
own
noise
it
seemed
odd
that
it
should
be
but
when
she
came
to
think
of
it
nobody
ever
did
get
bored
with
their
own
noise
topes
for
example
she
never
seemed
to
get
bored
zip
zip
zip
zip
zip
the
cicada
went
on
without
pause
concetta
knocked
at
the
door
at
seven
the
morning
was
as
bright
and
cloudless
as
all
the
mornings
were
barbara
jumped
up
looked
from
one
window
at
the
mountains
from
the
other
at
the
sea
all
seemed
to
be
well
with
them
all
was
well
with
her
too
this
morning
seated
at
the
mirror
she
did
not
so
much
as
think
of
the
big
monkey
in
the
far
obscure
corner
of
the
room
a
bathing
dress
and
a
sandals
a
handkerchief
round
her
head
and
she
was
ready
sleep
had
left
no
recollection
of
last
night
mortal
boredom
she
ran
downstairs
good
morning
mr
topes
topes
was
walking
in
the
garden
among
the
vines
he
turned
round
took
off
his
hat
smiled
a
greeting
good
morning
miss
barbara
he
paused
then
with
an
embarrassed
wriggle
of
introduction
he
went
on
a
queer
little
falter
came
into
his
voice
a
real
chaucerian
morning
miss
barbara
a
morning
only
it
happens
to
be
september
nature
is
fresh
and
bright
and
there
is
at
least
one
specimen
in
this
dream
garden
he
wriggled
more
uncomfortably
than
ever
and
there
was
a
tremulous
glitter
in
his
round
spectacle
lenses
of
the
poet
fresshe
folkes
he
bowed
in
her
direction
smiled
deprecatingly
and
was
silent
the
remark
it
seemed
to
him
now
that
he
had
finished
speaking
was
somehow
not
as
good
as
he
had
thought
it
would
be
barbara
laughed
chaucer
they
used
to
make
us
read
the
at
school
but
they
always
bored
me
are
you
going
to
bathe
not
before
breakfast
topes
shook
his
head
one
is
getting
a
little
too
old
for
that
is
one
why
did
the
silly
old
man
always
say
when
he
meant
she
could
help
laughing
at
him
well
i
must
hurry
or
else
i
shall
be
late
for
breakfast
again
and
you
know
how
i
catch
it
she
ran
out
through
the
gate
in
the
garden
wall
across
the
beach
to
the
striped
bathing
cabin
that
stood
before
the
house
fifty
yards
away
she
saw
the
marchese
prampolini
still
dripping
from
the
sea
running
up
towards
his
bathing
hut
catching
sight
of
her
he
flashed
a
smile
in
her
direction
gave
a
military
salute
barbara
waved
her
hand
then
thought
that
the
gesture
had
been
too
familiar
but
at
this
hour
of
the
morning
it
was
difficult
not
to
have
bad
jolly
manners
and
added
the
corrective
of
a
stiff
bow
after
all
she
had
only
met
him
yesterday
soon
she
was
swimming
out
to
sea
and
ugh
what
a
lot
of
horrible
huge
there
were
topes
had
followed
her
slowly
through
the
gate
and
across
the
sand
he
watched
her
running
down
from
the
cabin
slender
as
a
boy
with
long
bounding
strides
he
watched
her
go
jumping
with
great
splashes
through
the
deepening
water
then
throw
herself
forward
and
begin
to
swim
he
watched
her
till
she
was
no
more
than
a
small
dark
dot
far
out
emerging
from
his
cabin
the
marquis
met
him
walking
slowly
along
the
beach
his
head
bent
down
and
his
lips
slightly
moving
as
though
he
were
repeating
something
a
prayer
or
a
poem
to
himself
good
morning
signore
the
marquis
shook
him
by
the
hand
with
a
more
than
english
cordiality
good
morning
replied
topes
allowing
his
hand
to
be
shaken
he
resented
this
interruption
of
his
thoughts
she
swims
very
well
miss
buzzacott
very
assented
topes
and
smiled
to
himself
to
think
what
beautiful
poetical
things
he
might
have
said
if
he
had
chosen
well
so
so
said
the
marquis
too
colloquial
by
half
he
shook
hands
again
and
the
two
men
went
their
respective
ways
barbara
was
still
a
hundred
yards
from
the
shore
when
she
heard
the
crescendo
and
dying
boom
of
the
gong
floating
out
from
the
villa
damn
she
be
late
again
she
quickened
her
stroke
and
came
splashing
out
through
the
shallows
flushed
and
breathless
she
be
ten
minutes
late
she
calculated
it
would
take
her
at
least
that
to
do
her
hair
and
dress
topes
would
be
on
the
again
though
what
business
that
old
woman
had
to
lecture
her
as
she
did
goodness
only
knew
she
always
succeeded
in
making
herself
horribly
offensive
and
unpleasant
the
beach
was
quite
deserted
as
she
trotted
panting
across
it
empty
to
right
and
left
as
far
as
she
could
see
if
only
she
had
a
horse
to
go
galloping
at
the
water
edge
miles
and
miles
right
away
down
to
bocca
she
go
swim
the
river
she
saw
herself
crouching
on
the
horse
back
as
he
swam
with
legs
tucked
up
on
the
saddle
trying
not
to
get
her
feet
wet
and
gallop
on
again
goodness
only
knew
where
in
front
of
the
cabin
she
suddenly
halted
there
in
the
ruffled
sand
she
had
seen
a
writing
big
letters
faintly
legible
sprawled
across
her
path
o
clara
she
pieced
the
dim
letters
together
they
had
been
there
when
she
started
out
to
bathe
who
she
looked
round
the
beach
was
quite
empty
and
what
was
the
meaning
o
clara
she
took
her
from
the
cabin
slipped
on
her
sandals
and
ran
back
towards
the
house
as
fast
as
she
could
she
felt
most
horribly
frightened
it
was
a
sultry
headachey
sort
of
morning
with
a
hot
sirocco
that
stirred
the
bunting
on
the
flagstaffs
by
midday
the
thunderclouds
had
covered
half
the
sky
the
sun
still
blazed
on
the
sea
but
over
the
mountains
all
was
black
and
indigo
the
storm
broke
noisily
overhead
just
as
they
were
drinking
their
coffee
arthur
said
topes
painfully
calm
shut
the
shutters
please
she
was
not
frightened
no
but
she
preferred
not
to
see
the
lightning
when
the
room
was
darkened
she
began
to
talk
suavely
and
incessantly
lying
back
in
her
deep
barbara
was
thinking
of
clara
what
did
it
mean
and
who
was
clara
and
why
had
he
written
it
there
for
her
to
see
he
for
there
could
be
no
doubt
who
had
written
it
the
flash
of
teeth
and
eyes
the
military
salute
she
knew
she
ought
to
have
waved
to
him
he
had
written
it
there
while
she
was
swimming
out
written
it
and
then
run
away
she
rather
liked
that
just
an
extraordinary
word
on
the
sand
like
the
footprint
in
personally
topes
was
saying
i
prefer
harrod
the
thunder
crashed
and
rattled
it
was
rather
exhilarating
barbara
thought
one
felt
at
any
rate
that
something
was
happening
for
a
change
she
remembered
the
little
room
up
the
stairs
at
lady
thingumy
house
with
the
bookshelves
and
the
green
curtains
and
the
orange
shade
on
the
light
and
that
awful
young
man
like
a
white
slug
who
had
tried
to
kiss
her
there
at
the
dance
last
year
but
that
was
different
not
at
all
serious
and
the
young
man
had
been
so
horribly
ugly
she
saw
the
marquis
running
up
the
beach
quick
and
alert
copper
coloured
all
over
with
black
hair
he
was
certainly
very
handsome
but
as
for
being
in
love
well
what
did
that
exactly
mean
perhaps
when
she
knew
him
better
even
now
she
fancied
she
detected
something
o
clara
what
an
extraordinary
thing
it
was
with
his
long
fingers
buzzacott
combed
his
beard
this
winter
he
was
thinking
he
would
put
another
thousand
into
italian
money
when
the
exchange
was
favourable
in
the
spring
it
always
seemed
to
drop
back
again
one
could
clear
three
hundred
pounds
on
one
capital
if
the
exchange
went
down
to
seventy
the
income
on
three
hundred
was
fifteen
pounds
a
year
and
fifteen
pounds
was
now
fifteen
hundred
lire
and
fifteen
hundred
lire
when
you
came
to
think
of
it
was
really
sixty
pounds
that
was
to
say
that
one
would
make
an
addition
of
more
than
one
pound
a
week
to
one
income
by
this
simple
little
speculation
he
became
aware
that
topes
had
asked
him
a
question
yes
yes
perfectly
he
said
topes
talked
on
she
was
keeping
up
her
morale
was
she
right
in
believing
that
the
thunder
sounded
a
little
less
alarmingly
loud
and
near
topes
sat
polishing
his
spectacles
with
a
white
silk
handkerchief
vague
and
myopic
between
their
puckered
lids
his
eyes
seemed
lost
homeless
unhappy
he
was
thinking
about
beauty
there
were
certain
relations
between
the
eyelids
and
the
temples
between
the
breast
and
the
shoulder
there
were
certain
successions
of
sounds
but
what
about
them
ah
that
was
the
problem
that
was
the
problem
and
there
was
youth
there
was
innocence
but
it
was
all
very
obscure
and
there
were
so
many
phrases
so
many
remembered
pictures
and
melodies
he
seemed
to
get
himself
entangled
among
them
and
he
was
after
all
so
old
and
so
ineffective
he
put
on
his
spectacles
again
and
definition
came
into
the
foggy
world
beyond
his
eyes
the
shuttered
room
was
very
dark
he
could
distinguish
the
renaissance
profile
of
buzzacott
bearded
and
delicately
featured
in
her
deep
barbara
appeared
faintly
white
in
an
attitude
relaxed
and
brooding
and
topes
was
nothing
more
than
a
voice
in
the
darkness
she
had
got
on
to
the
marriage
of
the
prince
of
wales
who
would
they
eventually
find
for
him
clara
clara
she
saw
herself
so
clearly
as
the
they
would
have
a
house
in
rome
a
palace
she
saw
herself
in
the
palazzo
spada
it
had
such
a
lovely
vaulted
passage
leading
from
the
courtyard
to
the
gardens
at
the
back
marchesa
prampolini
palazzo
spada
roma
a
great
big
beautifully
engraved
and
she
would
go
riding
every
day
in
the
pincio
porta
il
mio
she
would
say
to
the
footman
who
answered
the
bell
would
that
be
quite
correct
hardly
she
have
to
take
some
proper
italian
lessons
to
talk
to
the
servants
one
must
never
be
ridiculous
before
servants
il
mio
haughtily
one
would
say
it
sitting
at
in
a
without
turning
round
it
would
be
a
green
with
a
black
tricorne
hat
braided
with
silver
la
mia
collazzione
al
letto
was
that
right
for
breakfast
in
bed
because
she
would
have
breakfast
in
bed
always
and
when
she
got
up
there
would
be
lovely
looking
glasses
with
three
panels
where
one
could
see
oneself
sideface
she
saw
herself
leaning
forward
powdering
her
nose
carefully
scientifically
with
the
monkey
creeping
up
behind
ooh
horrible
paura
di
questa
scimmia
questo
she
would
come
back
to
lunch
after
her
ride
perhaps
prampolini
would
be
there
she
had
rather
left
him
out
of
the
picture
so
far
è
il
marchese
sala
di
pranza
i
began
without
you
i
was
so
hungry
where
have
you
been
my
love
riding
my
dove
she
supposed
they
get
into
the
habit
of
saying
that
sort
of
thing
everyone
seemed
to
and
you
i
have
been
out
with
the
fascisti
oh
these
fascisti
would
life
be
worth
living
when
he
was
always
going
out
with
pistols
and
bombs
and
things
they
would
bring
him
back
one
day
on
a
stretcher
she
saw
it
pale
pale
with
blood
on
him
signore
è
ferito
nel
petto
gruvamente
e
how
could
she
bear
it
it
was
too
awful
too
too
terrible
her
breath
came
in
a
kind
of
sob
she
shuddered
as
though
she
had
been
hurt
morto
e
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
she
was
roused
suddenly
by
a
dazzling
light
the
storm
had
receded
far
enough
into
the
distance
to
permit
of
topes
opening
the
shutters
it
quite
stopped
raining
to
be
disturbed
in
one
intimate
sorrow
and
at
a
by
a
stranger
intrusion
an
alien
voice
barbara
turned
her
face
away
from
the
light
and
surreptitiously
wiped
her
eyes
they
might
see
and
ask
her
why
she
had
been
crying
she
hated
topes
for
opening
the
shutters
at
the
inrush
of
the
light
something
beautiful
had
flown
an
emotion
had
vanished
irrecoverably
it
was
a
sacrilege
buzzacott
looked
at
his
watch
too
late
i
fear
for
a
siesta
now
he
said
suppose
we
ring
for
an
early
tea
an
endless
succession
of
meals
said
topes
with
a
tremolo
and
a
sigh
that
what
life
seems
to
be
real
life
i
have
been
calculating
buzzacott
turned
his
pale
green
eyes
towards
his
guest
that
i
may
be
able
to
afford
that
pretty
little
cassone
after
all
it
would
be
a
bit
of
a
squeeze
he
played
with
his
beard
but
still
after
tea
barbara
and
topes
went
for
a
walk
along
the
beach
she
did
much
want
to
go
but
topes
thought
it
would
be
good
for
her
so
she
had
to
the
storm
had
passed
and
the
sky
over
the
sea
was
clear
but
the
waves
were
still
breaking
with
an
incessant
clamour
on
the
outer
shallows
driving
wide
sheets
of
water
high
up
the
beach
twenty
or
thirty
yards
above
the
line
where
on
a
day
of
calm
the
ripples
ordinarily
expired
smooth
shining
expanses
of
water
advanced
and
receded
like
steel
surfaces
moved
out
and
back
by
a
huge
machine
through
the
air
the
mountains
appeared
with
an
incredible
clarity
above
them
hung
huge
masses
of
cloud
clouds
over
carrara
said
topes
deprecating
his
remark
with
a
little
shake
of
the
head
and
a
movement
of
the
shoulders
i
like
to
fancy
sometimes
that
the
spirits
of
the
great
sculptors
lodge
among
these
marble
hills
and
that
it
is
their
unseen
hands
that
carve
the
clouds
into
these
enormous
splendid
shapes
i
imagine
their
ghosts
his
voice
trembled
feeling
about
among
superhuman
conceptions
planning
huge
groups
and
friezes
and
monumental
figures
with
blowing
draperies
planning
conceiving
but
never
quite
achieving
look
there
something
of
michelangelo
in
that
white
cloud
with
the
dark
shadows
underneath
it
topes
pointed
and
barbara
nodded
and
said
yes
yes
though
she
was
quite
sure
which
cloud
he
meant
it
like
night
on
the
medici
tomb
all
the
power
and
passion
are
brooding
inside
it
pent
up
and
there
in
that
sweeping
gesticulating
piece
of
vapour
you
see
the
one
i
mean
there
a
bernini
all
the
passion
on
the
surface
expressed
the
gesture
caught
at
its
most
violent
and
that
sleek
smug
white
fellow
over
there
that
a
delicious
absurd
canova
topes
chuckled
why
do
you
always
talk
about
art
said
barbara
you
bring
these
dead
people
into
everything
what
do
i
know
about
canova
or
whoever
it
is
they
were
none
of
them
alive
she
thought
of
that
dark
face
bright
as
a
lamp
with
life
he
at
least
was
dead
she
wondered
whether
the
letters
were
still
there
in
the
sand
before
the
cabin
no
of
course
not
the
rain
and
the
wind
would
have
blotted
them
out
topes
was
silent
he
walked
with
slightly
bent
knees
and
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
ground
he
wore
a
speckled
straw
hat
he
always
thought
of
art
that
was
what
was
wrong
with
him
like
an
old
tree
he
was
built
up
of
dead
wood
with
only
a
few
fibres
of
life
to
keep
him
from
rotting
away
they
walked
on
for
a
long
time
in
silence
here
the
river
said
topes
at
last
a
few
steps
more
and
they
were
on
the
bank
of
a
wide
stream
that
came
down
slowly
through
the
plain
to
the
sea
just
inland
from
the
beach
it
was
fringed
with
pine
trees
beyond
the
trees
one
could
see
the
plain
and
beyond
the
plain
were
the
mountains
in
this
calm
light
after
the
storm
everything
looked
strange
the
colours
seemed
deeper
and
more
intense
than
at
ordinary
times
and
though
all
was
so
clear
there
was
a
mysterious
air
of
remoteness
about
the
whole
scene
there
was
no
sound
except
the
continuous
breathing
of
the
sea
they
stood
for
a
little
while
looking
then
turned
back
far
away
along
the
beach
two
figures
were
slowly
approaching
white
flannel
trousers
a
pink
skirt
nature
topes
enunciated
with
a
shake
of
the
head
one
always
comes
back
to
nature
at
a
moment
such
as
this
in
surroundings
like
these
one
realises
it
one
lives
now
more
quietly
perhaps
but
more
profoundly
deep
watery
deep
waters
the
figures
drew
closer
was
it
the
marquis
and
who
was
with
him
barbara
strained
her
eyes
to
see
most
of
one
life
topes
went
on
is
one
prolonged
effort
to
prevent
oneself
thinking
your
father
and
i
we
collect
pictures
and
read
about
the
dead
other
people
achieve
the
same
results
by
drinking
or
breeding
rabbits
or
doing
amateur
carpentry
anything
rather
than
think
calmly
about
the
important
things
topes
was
silent
he
looked
about
him
at
the
sea
at
the
mountains
at
the
great
clouds
at
his
companion
a
frail
montagna
madonna
with
the
sea
and
the
westering
sun
the
mountains
and
the
storm
all
eternity
as
a
background
and
he
was
sixty
with
all
a
life
immensely
long
and
yet
timelessly
short
behind
him
an
empty
life
he
thought
of
death
and
the
miracles
of
beauty
behind
his
round
glittering
spectacles
he
felt
inclined
to
weep
the
approaching
couple
were
quite
near
now
what
a
funny
old
walrus
said
the
lady
walrus
your
natural
history
is
quite
wrong
the
marquis
laughed
he
much
too
dry
to
be
a
walrus
i
should
suggest
some
sort
of
an
old
cat
well
whatever
he
is
i
sorry
for
that
poor
little
girl
think
of
having
nobody
better
to
go
about
with
pretty
is
she
yes
but
too
young
of
course
i
like
the
innocence
innocence
cher
ami
these
english
girls
oh
la
la
they
may
look
innocent
but
believe
me
sh
sh
they
hear
you
pooh
they
do
understand
italian
the
marquis
raised
his
hand
the
old
walrus
he
whispered
then
addressed
himself
loudly
and
jovially
to
the
newcomers
good
evening
signorina
good
evening
topes
after
a
storm
the
air
is
always
the
purest
do
you
find
eh
barbara
nodded
leaving
topes
to
answer
it
was
his
sister
it
was
the
russian
woman
the
one
of
whom
topes
used
to
say
that
it
was
a
disgrace
she
should
be
allowed
to
stay
at
the
hotel
she
had
turned
away
dissociating
herself
from
the
conversation
barbara
looked
at
the
line
of
her
averted
face
topes
was
saying
something
about
the
pastoral
symphony
purple
face
powder
in
the
daylight
it
looked
hideous
well
au
revoir
the
flash
of
the
marquis
smile
was
directed
at
them
the
russian
woman
turned
back
from
the
sea
slightly
bowed
smiled
languidly
her
heavy
white
eyelids
were
almost
closed
she
seemed
the
prey
of
an
enormous
ennui
they
jar
a
little
said
topes
when
they
were
out
of
earshot
they
jar
on
the
time
on
the
place
on
the
emotion
they
have
the
innocence
for
this
this
he
wriggled
and
tremoloed
out
the
just
the
all
too
precious
word
this
prelapsarian
landscape
he
looked
sideways
at
barbara
and
wondered
what
she
was
so
thoughtfully
frowning
over
oh
lovely
and
delicate
young
creature
what
could
he
adequately
say
of
death
and
beauty
and
tenderness
tenderness
all
this
he
went
on
desperately
and
waved
his
hand
to
indicate
the
sky
the
sea
the
mountains
this
scene
is
like
something
remembered
clear
and
utterly
calm
remembered
across
great
gulfs
of
intervening
time
but
that
was
not
really
what
he
wanted
to
say
you
see
what
i
mean
he
asked
dubiously
she
made
no
reply
how
could
she
see
this
scene
is
so
clear
and
pure
and
remote
you
need
the
corresponding
emotion
those
people
were
out
of
harmony
they
clear
and
pure
enough
he
seemed
to
be
getting
more
muddled
than
ever
it
an
emotion
of
the
young
and
of
the
old
you
could
feel
it
i
could
feel
it
those
people
could
he
was
feeling
his
way
through
obscurities
where
would
he
finally
arrive
certain
poems
express
it
you
know
francis
jammes
i
have
thought
so
much
of
his
work
lately
art
instead
of
life
as
usual
but
then
i
made
that
way
i
ca
help
thinking
of
jammes
those
delicate
exquisite
things
he
wrote
about
clara
clara
she
stopped
and
stared
at
him
you
know
the
lines
topes
smiled
delightedly
this
makes
me
think
you
make
me
think
of
them
dans
les
temps
clara
but
my
dear
barbara
what
is
the
matter
she
had
started
crying
for
no
reason
whatever
v
nuns
at
luncheon
what
have
i
been
doing
since
you
saw
me
last
miss
penny
repeated
my
question
in
her
loud
emphatic
voice
well
when
did
you
see
me
last
it
must
have
been
june
i
computed
was
that
after
i
been
proposed
to
by
the
russian
general
yes
i
remember
hearing
about
the
russian
general
miss
penny
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
her
long
swung
and
rattled
corpses
hanging
in
chains
an
agreeably
literary
simile
and
her
laughter
was
like
brass
but
that
had
been
said
before
that
was
an
uproarous
incident
it
sad
you
should
have
heard
of
it
i
love
my
russian
general
story
yeux
me
rendent
she
laughed
again
she
had
eyes
like
a
hare
flush
with
her
head
and
very
bright
with
a
superficial
and
expressionless
brightness
what
a
formidable
woman
i
felt
sorry
for
the
russian
general
coeur
et
sans
she
went
on
quoting
the
poor
devil
words
such
a
delightful
motto
do
you
think
like
peur
et
sans
but
let
me
think
what
have
i
been
doing
since
then
thoughtfully
she
bit
into
the
crust
of
her
bread
with
long
sharp
white
teeth
two
mixed
grills
i
said
parenthetically
to
the
waiter
but
of
course
exclaimed
miss
penny
suddenly
i
have
seen
you
since
my
german
trip
all
sorts
of
adventures
my
appendicitis
my
nun
your
nun
my
marvellous
nun
i
must
tell
you
all
about
her
do
miss
penny
anecdotes
were
always
curious
i
looked
forward
to
an
entertaining
luncheon
you
knew
i
been
in
germany
this
autumn
well
i
did
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
still
i
was
just
wandering
round
miss
penny
described
a
circle
in
the
air
with
her
gaudily
jewelled
hand
she
always
twinkled
with
massive
and
improbable
jewellery
wandering
round
living
on
three
pounds
a
week
partly
amusing
myself
partly
collecting
material
for
a
few
little
articles
it
feels
like
to
be
a
conquered
nation
for
the
liberal
press
you
know
and
the
hun
is
trying
to
wriggle
out
of
the
indemnity
for
the
other
fellows
one
has
to
make
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds
do
you
find
but
we
must
talk
shop
well
i
was
wandering
round
and
very
pleasant
i
found
it
berlin
dresden
leipzig
then
down
to
munich
and
all
over
the
place
one
fine
day
i
got
to
grauburg
you
know
grauburg
it
one
of
those
german
towns
with
a
castle
on
a
hill
hanging
a
gothic
church
an
old
university
a
river
a
pretty
bridge
and
forests
all
round
charming
but
i
had
much
opportunity
to
appreciate
the
beauties
of
the
place
the
day
after
i
arrived
there
bang
i
went
down
with
appendicitis
screaming
i
may
add
but
how
appalling
they
whisked
me
off
to
hospital
and
cut
me
open
before
you
could
say
knife
excellent
surgeon
highly
efficient
sisters
of
charity
to
nurse
me
i
could
have
been
in
better
hands
but
it
was
a
bore
being
tied
there
by
the
leg
for
four
weeks
a
great
bore
still
the
thing
had
its
compensations
there
was
my
nun
for
example
ah
here
the
food
thank
heaven
the
mixed
grill
proved
to
be
excellent
miss
penny
description
of
the
pun
came
to
me
in
scraps
and
snatches
a
round
pink
pretty
face
in
a
winged
coif
blue
eyes
and
regular
features
teeth
altogether
too
perfect
false
in
fact
but
the
general
effect
extremely
pleasing
a
youthful
teutonic
twenty
eight
she
was
my
nurse
miss
penny
explained
but
i
used
to
see
her
quite
often
when
she
came
in
to
have
a
look
at
the
her
name
was
sister
agatha
during
the
war
they
told
me
she
had
converted
any
number
of
wounded
soldiers
to
the
true
faith
which
surprising
considering
how
pretty
she
was
did
she
try
and
convert
you
i
asked
she
was
such
a
fool
miss
penny
laughed
and
rattled
the
miniature
gallows
of
her
ears
i
amused
myself
for
a
moment
with
the
thought
of
miss
conversion
miss
penny
confronting
a
vast
assembly
of
fathers
of
the
church
rattling
her
earrings
at
their
discourses
on
the
trinity
laughing
her
appalling
laugh
at
the
doctrine
of
the
immaculate
conception
meeting
the
stern
look
of
the
grand
inquisitor
with
a
flash
of
her
bright
emotionless
hare
eyes
what
was
the
secret
of
the
woman
formidableness
but
i
was
missing
the
story
what
had
happened
ah
yes
the
gist
of
it
was
that
sister
agatha
had
appeared
one
morning
after
two
or
three
days
absence
dressed
not
as
a
nun
but
in
the
overalls
of
a
hospital
charwoman
with
a
handkerchief
instead
of
a
winged
coif
on
her
shaven
head
dead
said
miss
penny
she
looked
as
though
she
were
dead
a
walking
corpse
that
what
she
was
it
was
a
shocking
sight
i
should
have
thought
it
possible
for
anyone
to
change
so
much
in
so
short
a
time
she
walked
painfully
as
though
she
had
been
ill
for
months
and
she
had
great
burnt
rings
round
her
eyes
and
deep
lines
in
her
face
and
the
general
expression
of
unhappiness
that
was
something
quite
appalling
she
leaned
out
into
the
gangway
between
the
two
rows
of
tables
and
caught
the
passing
waiter
by
the
end
of
one
his
the
little
italian
looked
round
with
an
expression
of
surprise
that
deepened
into
terror
on
his
face
half
a
pint
of
guinness
ordered
miss
penny
and
after
this
bring
me
some
jam
roll
no
jam
roll
madam
damn
said
miss
penny
bring
me
what
you
like
then
she
let
go
of
the
waiter
tail
and
resumed
her
narrative
where
was
i
yes
i
remember
she
came
into
my
room
i
was
telling
you
with
a
bucket
of
water
and
a
brush
dressed
like
a
charwoman
naturally
i
was
rather
surprised
on
earth
are
you
doing
sister
agatha
i
asked
no
answer
she
just
shook
her
head
and
began
to
scrub
the
floor
when
she
finished
she
left
the
room
without
so
much
as
looking
at
me
again
happened
to
sister
agatha
i
asked
my
nurse
when
she
next
came
in
say
say
i
said
no
answer
it
took
nearly
a
week
to
find
out
what
really
had
happened
nobody
dared
tell
me
it
was
as
they
used
to
say
in
the
good
old
days
but
i
wormed
it
out
in
the
long
run
my
nurse
the
doctor
the
charwomen
i
got
something
out
of
all
of
them
i
always
get
what
i
want
in
the
end
miss
penny
laughed
like
a
horse
i
sure
you
do
i
said
politely
much
obliged
acknowledged
miss
penny
but
to
proceed
my
information
came
to
me
in
fragmentary
whispers
agatha
ran
away
with
a
man
dear
of
the
patients
you
do
say
criminal
out
of
the
jail
the
plot
ran
away
from
her
it
seems
to
grow
thinner
brought
her
back
here
she
been
disgraced
there
been
a
funeral
service
for
her
in
the
chapel
coffin
and
all
she
had
to
be
present
at
it
her
own
funeral
she
is
a
nun
any
more
she
has
to
do
charwoman
work
now
the
roughest
in
the
hospital
she
not
allowed
to
speak
to
anybody
and
nobody
allowed
to
speak
to
her
she
regarded
as
dead
miss
penny
paused
to
signal
to
the
harassed
little
italian
my
small
she
called
out
coming
coming
and
the
foreign
voice
cried
guinness
down
the
lift
and
from
below
another
voice
echoed
guinness
i
filled
in
the
details
bit
by
bit
there
was
our
hero
to
begin
with
i
had
to
bring
him
into
the
picture
which
was
rather
difficult
as
i
had
never
seen
him
but
i
got
a
photograph
of
him
the
police
circulated
one
when
he
got
away
i
do
suppose
they
ever
caught
him
miss
penny
opened
her
bag
here
it
is
she
said
i
always
carry
it
about
with
me
it
become
a
superstition
for
years
i
remember
i
used
to
carry
a
little
bit
of
heather
tied
up
with
string
beautiful
is
it
a
sort
of
renaissance
look
about
it
do
you
think
he
was
you
know
italian
ah
that
explained
it
i
had
been
wondering
how
bavaria
could
have
produced
this
creature
with
the
big
dark
eyes
the
finely
modelled
nose
and
chin
and
the
fleshy
lips
so
royally
and
sensually
curved
he
certainly
very
superb
i
said
handing
back
the
picture
miss
penny
put
it
carefully
away
in
her
bag
is
he
she
said
quite
marvellous
but
his
character
and
his
mind
were
even
better
i
see
him
as
one
of
those
innocent
childlike
monsters
of
iniquity
who
are
simply
unaware
of
the
existence
of
right
and
wrong
and
he
had
genius
the
real
italian
genius
for
engineering
for
dominating
and
exploiting
nature
a
true
son
of
the
roman
aqueduct
builders
he
was
and
a
brother
of
the
electrical
engineers
only
kuno
that
was
his
name
did
work
in
water
he
worked
in
women
he
knew
how
to
harness
the
natural
energy
of
passion
he
made
devotion
drive
his
mills
the
commercial
exploitation
of
that
was
his
specialty
i
sometimes
wonder
miss
penny
added
in
a
different
tone
whether
i
shall
ever
be
exploited
when
i
get
a
little
more
and
celibate
by
one
of
these
young
engineers
of
the
passions
it
would
be
humiliating
particularly
as
i
done
so
little
exploiting
from
my
side
she
frowned
and
was
silent
for
a
moment
no
decidedly
miss
penny
was
not
beautiful
you
could
not
even
honestly
say
that
she
had
charm
or
was
attractive
that
high
scotch
colouring
those
hare
eyes
the
voice
the
terrifying
laugh
and
the
size
of
her
the
general
formidableness
of
the
woman
no
no
no
you
said
he
had
been
in
prison
i
said
the
silence
with
all
its
implications
was
becoming
embarrassing
miss
penny
sighed
looked
up
and
nodded
he
was
fool
enough
she
said
to
leave
the
straight
and
certain
road
of
female
exploitation
for
the
dangerous
courses
of
burglary
we
all
have
our
occasional
accesses
of
folly
they
gave
him
a
heavy
sentence
but
he
succeeded
in
getting
pneumonia
i
think
it
was
a
week
after
entering
jail
he
was
transferred
to
the
hospital
sister
agatha
with
her
known
talent
for
saving
souls
was
given
him
as
his
particular
attendant
but
it
was
he
i
afraid
who
did
the
converting
miss
penny
finished
off
the
last
mouthful
of
the
ginger
pudding
which
the
waiter
had
brought
in
lieu
of
jam
roll
i
suppose
you
do
smoke
cheroots
i
said
as
i
opened
my
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
miss
penny
replied
she
looked
sharply
round
the
restaurant
i
must
just
see
if
there
are
any
of
those
horrible
little
gossip
paragraphers
here
one
does
want
to
figure
in
the
social
and
personal
column
morning
fact
which
is
not
so
generally
known
as
it
ought
to
be
is
that
miss
penny
the
woman
journalist
always
ends
her
luncheon
with
a
burma
cheroot
i
saw
her
yesterday
in
a
restaurant
not
a
hundred
miles
from
carmelite
street
smoking
like
a
house
on
fire
you
know
the
touch
but
the
coast
seems
to
be
clear
thank
goodness
she
took
a
cheroot
from
the
case
lit
it
at
my
proffered
match
and
went
on
talking
yes
it
was
young
kuno
who
did
the
converting
sister
agatha
was
converted
back
into
the
worldly
melpomene
fugger
she
had
been
before
she
became
the
bride
of
holiness
melpomene
fugger
that
was
her
name
i
had
her
history
from
my
old
doctor
he
had
seen
all
grauburg
living
and
dying
and
propagating
for
generations
melpomene
fugger
why
he
had
brought
little
melpel
into
the
world
little
melpchen
her
father
was
professor
fugger
the
great
professor
fugger
the
oh
yes
of
course
i
know
the
name
so
well
he
was
the
man
who
wrote
the
standard
work
on
lemuria
you
know
the
hypothetical
continent
where
the
lemurs
come
from
i
showed
due
respect
he
was
a
disciple
of
herder
a
as
they
beautifully
call
it
over
there
anglophile
too
and
always
ate
porridge
for
breakfast
up
till
august
then
the
radiant
morning
of
the
fifth
he
renounced
it
for
ever
solemnly
and
with
tears
in
his
eyes
the
national
food
of
a
people
who
had
betrayed
culture
and
civilisation
how
could
he
go
on
eating
it
it
would
stick
in
his
throat
in
future
he
would
have
a
lightly
boiled
egg
he
sounded
i
thought
altogether
charming
and
his
daughter
melpomene
she
sounded
charming
too
and
such
thick
yellow
when
she
was
young
her
mother
was
dead
and
a
sister
of
the
great
professor
ruled
the
house
with
an
iron
rod
aunt
bertha
was
her
name
well
melpomene
grew
up
very
plump
and
appetising
when
she
was
seventeen
something
very
odious
and
disagreeable
happened
to
her
even
the
doctor
did
know
exactly
what
it
was
but
he
would
have
been
surprised
if
it
had
had
something
to
do
with
the
then
professor
of
latin
an
old
friend
of
the
family
who
combined
it
seems
great
erudition
with
a
horrid
fondness
for
very
young
ladies
miss
penny
knocked
half
an
inch
of
cigar
ash
into
her
empty
glass
if
i
wrote
short
stories
she
went
on
reflectively
but
it
too
much
bother
i
should
make
this
anecdote
into
a
sort
of
potted
life
history
beginning
with
a
scene
immediately
after
this
disagreeable
event
in
melpomene
life
i
see
the
scene
so
clearly
poor
little
melpel
is
leaning
over
the
bastions
of
grauburg
castle
weeping
into
the
june
night
and
the
mulberry
trees
in
the
garden
thirty
feet
below
she
is
besieged
by
the
memory
of
what
happened
this
dreadful
afternoon
professor
engelmann
her
father
old
friend
with
the
magnificent
red
assyrian
beard
too
awful
too
awful
but
then
as
i
was
saying
short
stones
are
really
too
much
bother
or
perhaps
i
too
stupid
to
write
them
i
bequeath
it
to
you
you
know
how
to
tick
these
things
off
you
generous
not
at
all
said
miss
penny
my
terms
are
ten
per
cent
commission
on
the
american
sale
incidentally
there
wo
be
an
american
sale
poor
melpchen
history
is
not
for
the
chaste
public
of
those
states
but
let
me
hear
what
you
propose
to
do
with
melpomene
now
you
got
her
on
the
castle
bastions
that
simple
i
said
i
know
all
about
german
university
towns
and
castles
on
hills
i
shall
make
her
look
into
the
june
night
as
you
suggest
into
the
violet
night
with
its
points
of
golden
flame
there
will
be
the
black
silhouette
of
the
castle
with
its
sharp
roofs
and
hooded
turrets
behind
her
from
the
hanging
in
the
town
below
the
voices
of
the
students
singing
in
perfect
harmony
will
float
up
through
the
spaces
röslein
röslein
and
ringlein
sprang
in
the
sweet
old
songs
will
make
her
cry
all
the
more
her
tears
will
patter
like
rain
among
the
leaves
of
the
mulberry
trees
in
the
garden
below
does
that
seem
to
you
adequate
very
nice
said
miss
penny
but
how
are
you
going
to
bring
the
sex
problem
and
all
of
its
horrors
into
the
landscape
well
let
me
think
i
called
to
memory
those
distant
foreign
summers
when
i
was
completing
my
education
i
know
i
shall
suddenly
bring
a
swarm
of
moving
candles
and
chinese
lanterns
under
the
mulberry
trees
you
imagine
the
rich
lights
and
shadows
the
leafage
the
faces
and
moving
limbs
of
men
and
women
seen
for
an
instant
and
gone
again
they
are
students
and
girls
of
the
town
come
out
to
dance
this
windless
blue
june
night
under
the
mulberry
trees
and
now
they
begin
thumping
round
and
round
in
a
ring
to
the
music
of
their
own
singing
können
können
now
the
rhythm
changes
quickens
wir
können
tanzen
bumstarara
bumstarara
wir
können
tanzen
bumstarara
the
dance
becomes
a
rush
an
elephantine
prancing
on
the
dry
lawn
under
the
mulberry
trees
and
from
the
bastion
melpomene
looks
down
and
perceives
suddenly
and
apocalyptically
that
everything
in
the
world
is
sex
sex
sex
men
and
women
male
and
female
always
the
same
and
all
in
the
light
of
the
horror
of
the
afternoon
disgusting
that
how
i
should
do
it
miss
penny
and
very
nice
too
but
i
wish
you
could
find
a
place
to
bring
in
my
conversation
with
the
doctor
i
shall
never
forget
the
way
he
cleared
his
throat
and
coughed
before
embarking
on
the
delicate
subject
may
know
ahem
gracious
miss
he
began
may
know
that
religious
phenomena
are
often
ahem
closely
connected
with
sexual
causes
i
replied
that
i
had
heard
rumours
which
might
justify
me
in
believing
this
to
be
true
among
roman
catholics
but
that
in
the
church
of
england
and
i
for
one
was
a
practitioner
of
anglicanismus
it
was
very
different
might
be
said
the
doctor
he
had
had
no
opportunity
in
the
course
of
his
long
medical
career
of
personally
studying
anglicanismus
but
he
could
vouch
for
the
fact
that
among
his
patients
here
in
grauburg
mysticismus
was
very
often
mixed
up
with
the
melpomene
was
a
case
in
point
after
that
hateful
afternoon
she
had
become
extremely
religious
the
professor
of
latin
had
diverted
her
emotions
out
of
their
normal
channels
she
rebelled
against
the
placid
agnosticismus
of
her
father
and
at
night
in
secret
when
aunt
bertha
dragon
eyes
were
closed
she
would
read
such
forbidden
books
as
life
of
theresa
the
little
flowers
of
francis
the
imitation
of
and
the
horribly
enthralling
of
aunt
bertha
confiscated
these
works
whenever
she
came
upon
them
she
considered
them
more
pernicious
than
the
novels
of
marcel
prévost
the
character
of
a
good
potential
housewife
might
be
completely
undermined
by
reading
of
this
kind
it
was
rather
a
relief
for
melpomene
when
aunt
bertha
shuffled
off
in
the
summer
of
this
mortal
coil
she
was
one
of
those
indispensables
of
whom
one
makes
the
discovery
when
they
are
gone
that
one
can
get
on
quite
as
well
without
them
poor
aunt
bertha
one
can
imagine
melpomene
trying
to
believe
she
was
sorry
and
horribly
ashamed
to
find
that
she
was
really
in
secret
almost
glad
the
suggestion
seemed
to
me
ingenious
but
miss
penny
accepted
it
as
obvious
precisely
she
said
and
the
emotion
would
only
further
confirm
and
give
new
force
to
the
tendencies
which
her
aunt
death
left
her
free
to
indulge
as
much
as
she
liked
remorse
contrition
they
would
lead
to
the
idea
of
doing
penance
and
for
one
who
was
now
wallowing
in
the
martyrology
penance
was
the
mortification
of
the
flesh
she
used
to
kneel
for
hours
at
night
in
the
cold
she
ate
too
little
and
when
her
teeth
ached
which
they
often
did
for
she
had
a
set
the
doctor
told
me
which
had
given
trouble
from
the
very
first
she
would
not
go
and
see
the
dentist
but
lay
awake
at
night
savouring
to
the
full
her
excruciations
and
feeling
triumphantly
that
they
must
in
some
strange
way
be
pleasing
to
the
mysterious
powers
she
went
on
like
that
for
two
or
three
years
till
she
was
poisoned
through
and
through
in
the
end
she
went
down
with
gastric
ulcer
it
was
three
months
before
she
came
out
of
hospital
well
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
space
of
years
and
with
a
brand
new
set
of
imperishable
teeth
all
gold
and
ivory
and
in
mind
too
she
was
changed
for
the
better
i
suppose
the
nuns
who
nursed
her
had
made
her
see
that
in
mortifying
herself
she
had
acted
supererogatively
and
through
spiritual
pride
instead
of
doing
right
she
had
sinned
the
only
road
to
salvation
they
told
her
lay
in
discipline
in
the
orderliness
of
established
religion
in
obedience
to
authority
secretly
so
as
not
to
distress
her
poor
father
whose
agnosticismus
was
extremely
dogmatic
for
all
its
unobtrusiveness
melpomene
became
a
roman
catholic
she
was
only
a
few
months
later
came
the
war
and
professor
fugger
eternal
renunciation
of
porridge
he
did
not
long
survive
the
making
of
that
patriotic
gesture
in
the
autumn
of
he
caught
a
fatal
influenza
melpomene
was
alone
in
the
world
in
the
spring
of
there
was
a
new
and
very
conscientious
sister
of
charity
at
work
among
the
wounded
in
the
hospital
of
grauburg
here
explained
miss
penny
jabbing
the
air
with
her
forefinger
you
put
a
line
of
asterisks
or
dots
to
signify
a
six
years
gulf
in
the
narrative
and
you
begin
again
right
in
the
middle
of
a
dialogue
between
sister
agatha
and
the
newly
convalescent
kuno
what
their
dialogue
to
be
about
i
asked
oh
that
easy
enough
said
miss
penny
almost
anything
would
do
what
about
this
for
example
you
explain
that
the
fever
has
just
abated
for
the
first
time
for
days
the
young
man
is
fully
conscious
he
feels
himself
to
be
well
reborn
as
it
were
in
a
new
world
a
world
so
bright
and
novel
and
jolly
that
he
ca
help
laughing
at
the
sight
of
it
he
looks
about
him
the
flies
on
the
ceiling
strike
him
as
being
extremely
comic
how
do
they
manage
to
walk
upside
down
they
have
suckers
on
their
feet
says
sister
agatha
and
wonders
if
her
natural
history
is
quite
sound
suckers
on
their
feet
ha
ha
what
an
uproarious
notion
suckers
on
their
feet
that
good
that
damned
good
you
can
say
charming
pathetic
positively
tender
things
about
the
irrelevant
mirth
of
convalescents
the
more
so
in
this
particular
case
where
the
mirth
is
expressed
by
a
young
man
who
is
to
be
taken
back
to
jail
as
soon
as
he
can
stand
firmly
on
his
legs
ha
ha
laugh
on
unhappy
boy
it
is
the
quacking
of
the
fates
the
parcæ
the
norns
miss
penny
gave
an
exaggerated
imitation
of
her
own
brassy
laughter
at
the
sound
of
it
the
few
lunchers
who
still
lingered
at
the
other
tables
looked
up
startled
you
can
write
pages
about
destiny
and
its
ironic
quacking
tremendously
impressive
and
there
money
in
every
line
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
good
then
i
can
get
on
with
my
story
the
days
pass
and
the
first
hilarity
of
convalescence
fades
away
the
young
man
remembers
and
grows
sullen
his
strength
comes
back
to
him
and
with
it
a
sense
of
despair
his
mind
broods
incessantly
on
the
hateful
future
as
for
the
consolations
of
religion
he
wo
listen
to
them
sister
agatha
perseveres
oh
with
what
anxious
solicitude
in
the
attempt
to
make
him
understand
and
believe
and
be
comforted
it
is
all
so
tremendously
important
and
in
this
case
somehow
more
important
than
in
any
other
and
now
you
see
the
working
yeastily
and
obscurely
and
once
again
the
quacking
of
the
norns
is
audible
by
the
way
said
miss
penny
changing
her
tone
and
leaning
confidentially
across
the
table
i
wish
you
tell
me
something
tell
me
do
you
really
honestly
i
mean
do
you
seriously
believe
in
literature
believe
in
literature
i
was
thinking
miss
penny
explained
of
ironic
fate
and
the
quacking
of
the
norns
and
all
that
yes
and
then
there
this
psychology
and
introspection
business
and
construction
and
good
narrative
and
word
pictures
and
mot
and
verbal
magic
and
striking
metaphors
i
remembered
that
i
had
compared
miss
penny
tinkling
to
skeletons
hanging
in
chains
and
then
finally
and
to
begin
with
alpha
and
omega
ourselves
two
professionals
gloating
with
an
absolute
lack
of
sympathy
over
a
seduced
nun
and
speculating
on
the
best
method
of
turning
her
misfortunes
into
cash
it
all
very
curious
it
when
one
begins
to
think
about
it
dispassionately
very
curious
i
agreed
but
then
so
is
everything
else
if
you
look
at
it
like
that
no
no
said
miss
penny
nothing
so
curious
as
our
business
but
i
shall
never
get
to
the
end
of
my
story
if
i
get
started
on
first
principles
miss
penny
continued
her
narrative
i
was
still
thinking
of
literature
do
you
believe
in
it
seriously
ah
luckily
the
question
was
quite
meaningless
the
story
came
to
me
rather
vaguely
but
it
seemed
that
the
young
man
was
getting
better
in
a
few
more
days
the
doctor
had
said
he
would
be
well
well
enough
to
go
back
to
jail
no
no
the
question
was
meaningless
i
would
think
about
it
no
more
i
concentrated
my
attention
again
sister
agatha
i
heard
miss
penny
saying
prayed
exhorted
indoctrinated
whenever
she
had
half
a
minute
to
spare
from
her
other
duties
she
would
come
running
into
the
young
man
room
wonder
if
you
fully
realise
the
importance
of
prayer
she
would
ask
and
before
he
had
time
to
answer
she
would
give
him
a
breathless
account
of
the
uses
and
virtues
of
regular
and
patient
supplication
or
else
it
was
i
tell
you
about
st
theresa
or
stephen
the
first
martyr
you
know
about
him
do
you
kuno
simply
would
listen
at
first
it
seemed
so
fantastically
irrelevant
such
an
absurd
interruption
to
his
thoughts
his
serious
despairing
thoughts
about
the
future
prison
was
real
imminent
and
this
woman
buzzed
about
him
with
her
ridiculous
then
suddenly
one
day
he
began
to
listen
he
showed
signs
of
contrition
and
conversion
sister
agatha
announced
her
triumph
to
the
other
nuns
and
there
was
rejoicing
over
the
one
lost
sheep
melpomene
had
never
felt
so
happy
in
her
life
and
kuno
looking
at
her
radiant
face
must
have
wondered
how
he
could
have
been
such
a
fool
as
not
to
see
from
the
first
what
was
now
so
obvious
the
woman
had
lost
her
head
about
him
and
he
had
only
four
days
now
four
days
in
which
to
tap
the
tumultuous
love
power
to
canalise
it
to
set
it
working
for
his
escape
why
had
he
started
a
week
ago
he
could
have
made
certain
of
it
then
but
now
there
was
no
knowing
four
days
was
a
horribly
short
time
how
did
he
do
it
i
asked
for
miss
penny
had
paused
that
for
you
to
say
she
replied
and
shook
her
at
me
i
do
know
nobody
knows
i
imagine
except
the
two
parties
concerned
and
perhaps
sister
agatha
confessor
but
one
can
reconstruct
the
crime
as
they
say
how
would
you
have
done
it
you
a
man
you
ought
to
be
familiar
with
the
processes
of
amorous
engineering
you
flatter
me
i
answered
do
you
seriously
suppose
i
extended
my
arms
miss
penny
laughed
like
a
horse
no
but
seriously
it
a
problem
the
case
is
a
very
special
one
the
person
a
nun
the
place
a
hospital
the
opportunities
few
there
could
be
no
favourable
circumstances
no
moonlight
no
distant
music
and
any
form
of
direct
attack
would
be
sure
to
fail
that
audacious
confidence
which
is
your
amorist
best
weapon
would
be
useless
here
obviously
said
miss
penny
but
there
are
surely
other
methods
there
is
the
approach
through
pity
and
the
maternal
instincts
and
there
the
approach
through
higher
things
through
the
soul
kuno
must
have
worked
on
those
lines
do
you
think
one
can
imagine
him
letting
himself
be
converted
praying
with
her
and
at
the
same
time
appealing
for
her
sympathy
and
even
threatening
with
a
great
air
of
seriousness
kill
himself
rather
than
go
back
to
jail
you
can
write
that
up
easily
and
convincingly
enough
but
it
the
sort
of
thing
that
bores
me
so
frightfully
to
do
that
why
i
can
never
bring
myself
to
write
fiction
what
is
the
point
of
it
all
and
the
way
you
literary
men
think
yourselves
so
important
particularly
if
you
write
tragedies
it
all
very
queer
very
queer
indeed
i
made
no
comment
miss
penny
changed
her
tone
and
went
on
with
the
narrative
well
she
said
whatever
the
means
employed
the
engineering
process
was
perfectly
successful
love
was
made
to
find
out
a
way
on
the
afternoon
before
kuno
was
to
go
back
to
prison
two
sisters
of
charity
walked
out
of
the
hospital
gates
crossed
the
square
in
front
of
it
glided
down
the
narrow
streets
towards
the
river
boarded
a
tram
at
the
bridge
and
did
not
descend
till
the
car
had
reached
its
terminus
in
the
farther
suburbs
they
began
to
walk
briskly
along
the
high
road
out
into
the
country
said
one
of
them
when
they
were
clear
of
the
houses
and
with
the
gesture
of
a
conjurer
produced
from
nowhere
a
red
leather
purse
did
it
come
from
asked
the
other
opening
her
eyes
memories
of
elisha
and
the
ravens
of
the
widow
cruse
of
the
loaves
and
fishes
must
have
floated
through
the
radiant
fog
in
poor
melpomene
mind
old
lady
i
was
sitting
next
to
in
the
tram
left
her
bag
open
nothing
could
have
been
simpler
you
do
mean
to
say
you
stole
it
kuno
swore
horribly
he
had
opened
the
purse
sixty
marks
who
have
thought
that
an
old
camel
all
dressed
up
in
silk
and
furs
would
only
have
sixty
marks
in
her
purse
and
i
must
have
a
thousand
at
least
to
get
away
it
easy
to
reconstruct
the
rest
of
the
conversation
down
to
the
inevitable
god
sake
shut
up
with
which
kuno
put
an
end
to
melpomene
dismayed
moralising
they
trudge
on
in
silence
kuno
thinks
desperately
only
sixty
marks
he
can
do
nothing
with
that
if
only
he
had
something
to
sell
a
piece
of
jewellery
some
gold
or
silver
anything
anything
he
knows
such
a
good
place
for
selling
things
is
he
to
be
caught
again
for
lack
of
a
few
marks
melpomene
is
also
thinking
evil
must
often
be
done
that
good
may
follow
after
all
had
not
she
herself
stolen
sister
mary
of
the
purification
clothes
when
she
was
asleep
after
night
duty
had
not
she
run
away
from
the
convent
broken
her
vows
and
yet
how
convinced
she
was
that
she
was
doing
rightly
the
mysterious
powers
emphatically
approved
she
felt
sure
of
it
and
now
there
was
the
red
purse
but
what
was
a
red
purse
in
comparison
with
a
saved
soul
and
after
all
what
was
she
doing
hut
saving
kuno
soul
miss
penny
who
had
adapted
the
voice
and
gestures
of
a
debater
asking
rhetorical
questions
brought
her
hand
with
a
slap
on
to
the
table
lord
what
a
bore
this
sort
of
stuff
is
she
exclaimed
let
get
to
the
end
of
this
dingy
anecdote
as
quickly
as
possible
by
this
time
you
must
imagine
the
shades
of
night
were
falling
fast
the
chill
november
twilight
and
so
on
but
i
leave
the
natural
descriptions
to
you
kuno
gets
into
the
ditch
at
the
roadside
and
takes
off
his
robes
one
imagines
that
he
would
feel
himself
safer
in
trousers
more
capable
of
acting
with
decision
in
a
crisis
they
tramp
on
for
miles
late
in
the
evening
they
leave
the
high
road
and
strike
up
through
the
fields
towards
the
forest
at
the
fringe
of
the
wood
they
find
one
of
those
wheeled
huts
where
the
shepherds
sleep
in
the
lambing
season
the
real
du
berger
precisely
said
miss
penny
and
she
began
to
recite
ton
coeur
gémissant
du
poids
de
notre
traine
et
se
débat
comme
un
aigle
blessé
how
does
it
go
on
i
used
to
adore
it
all
so
much
when
i
was
a
girl
le
seuil
est
perfumé
est
large
et
sombre
là
parmi
les
fleurs
nous
trouverons
dans
nos
cheveux
unis
un
lit
i
could
go
on
like
this
indefinitely
do
i
said
no
no
no
no
i
determined
to
finish
this
wretched
story
kuno
broke
the
padlock
of
the
door
they
entered
what
happened
in
that
little
hut
miss
penny
leaned
forward
at
me
her
large
hare
eyes
glittered
the
long
swung
and
faintly
tinkled
imagine
the
emotions
of
a
virgin
of
thirty
and
a
nun
at
that
in
the
terrifying
presence
of
desire
imagine
the
easy
familiar
brutalities
of
the
young
man
oh
there
pages
to
be
made
out
of
this
the
absolutely
impenetrable
darkness
the
smell
of
straw
the
voices
the
strangled
crying
the
movements
and
one
likes
to
fancy
that
the
emotions
pulsing
about
in
that
confined
space
made
palpable
vibrations
like
a
deep
sound
that
shakes
the
air
why
it
literature
this
scene
in
the
morning
miss
penny
went
on
after
a
pause
two
woodcutters
on
their
way
to
work
noticed
that
the
door
of
the
hut
was
ajar
they
approached
the
hut
cautiously
their
axes
raised
and
ready
for
a
blow
if
there
should
be
need
of
it
peeping
in
they
saw
a
woman
in
a
black
dress
lying
face
downward
in
the
straw
dead
no
she
moved
she
moaned
the
matter
a
blubbered
face
smeared
with
streaks
of
grey
dust
is
lifted
towards
them
the
matter
gone
what
a
queer
indistinct
utterance
the
woodcutters
regard
one
another
what
does
she
say
she
a
foreigner
perhaps
the
matter
they
repeat
once
more
the
woman
bursts
out
violently
crying
gone
he
gone
she
sobs
out
in
her
vague
inarticulate
way
gone
that
what
she
says
gone
left
me
the
devil
speak
a
little
more
distinctly
ca
she
wails
taken
my
teeth
what
teeth
and
the
shrill
voice
breaks
into
a
scream
and
she
falls
back
sobbing
into
the
straw
the
woodcutters
look
significantly
at
one
another
they
nod
one
of
them
applies
a
thick
forefinger
to
his
forehead
miss
penny
looked
at
her
watch
good
heavens
she
said
it
nearly
three
i
must
fly
do
forget
about
the
funeral
service
she
added
as
she
put
on
her
coat
the
tapers
the
black
coffin
in
the
middle
of
the
aisle
the
nuns
in
their
coifs
the
gloomy
chanting
and
the
poor
cowering
creature
without
any
teeth
her
face
all
caved
in
like
an
old
woman
wondering
whether
she
was
really
and
in
fact
dead
wondering
whether
she
was
already
in
hell
