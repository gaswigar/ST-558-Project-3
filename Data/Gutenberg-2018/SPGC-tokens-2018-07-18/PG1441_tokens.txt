the
story
of
an
african
farm
by
aka
ralph
iron
olive
schreiner
preface
i
have
to
thank
cordially
the
public
and
my
critics
for
the
reception
they
have
given
this
little
book
dealing
with
a
subject
that
is
far
removed
from
the
round
of
english
daily
life
it
of
necessity
lacks
the
charm
that
hangs
about
the
ideal
representation
of
familiar
things
and
its
reception
has
therefore
been
the
more
kindly
a
word
of
explanation
is
necessary
two
strangers
appear
on
the
scene
and
some
have
fancied
that
in
the
second
they
have
again
the
first
who
returns
in
a
new
guise
why
this
should
be
we
can
not
tell
unless
there
is
a
feeling
that
a
man
should
not
appear
upon
the
scene
and
then
disappear
leaving
behind
him
no
more
substantial
trace
than
a
mere
book
that
he
should
return
later
on
as
husband
or
lover
to
fill
some
more
important
part
than
that
of
the
mere
stimulator
of
thought
human
life
may
be
painted
according
to
two
methods
there
is
the
stage
method
according
to
that
each
character
is
duly
marshalled
at
first
and
ticketed
we
know
with
an
immutable
certainty
that
at
the
right
crises
each
one
will
reappear
and
act
his
part
and
when
the
curtain
falls
all
will
stand
before
it
bowing
there
is
a
sense
of
satisfaction
in
this
and
of
completeness
but
there
is
another
method
the
method
of
the
life
we
all
lead
here
nothing
can
be
prophesied
there
is
a
strange
coming
and
going
of
feet
men
appear
act
and
upon
each
other
and
pass
away
when
the
crisis
comes
the
man
who
would
fit
it
does
not
return
when
the
curtain
falls
no
one
is
ready
when
the
footlights
are
brightest
they
are
blown
out
and
what
the
name
of
the
play
is
no
one
knows
if
there
sits
a
spectator
who
knows
he
sits
so
high
that
the
players
in
the
gaslight
can
not
hear
his
breathing
life
may
be
painted
according
to
either
method
but
the
methods
are
different
the
canons
of
criticism
that
bear
upon
the
one
cut
cruelly
upon
the
other
it
has
been
suggested
by
a
kind
critic
that
he
would
better
have
liked
the
little
book
if
it
had
been
a
history
of
wild
adventure
of
cattle
driven
into
inaccessible
kranzes
by
bushmen
of
encounters
with
ravening
lions
and
this
could
not
be
such
works
are
best
written
in
piccadilly
or
in
the
strand
there
the
gifts
of
the
creative
imagination
untrammelled
by
contact
with
any
fact
may
spread
their
wings
but
should
one
sit
down
to
paint
the
scenes
among
which
he
has
grown
he
will
find
that
the
facts
creep
in
upon
him
those
brilliant
phases
and
shapes
which
the
imagination
sees
in
lands
are
not
for
him
to
portray
sadly
he
must
squeeze
the
colour
from
his
brush
and
dip
it
into
the
gray
pigments
around
him
he
must
paint
what
lies
before
him
iron
we
must
see
the
first
images
which
the
external
world
casts
upon
the
dark
mirror
of
his
mind
or
must
hear
the
first
words
which
awaken
the
sleeping
powers
of
thought
and
stand
by
his
earliest
efforts
if
we
would
understand
the
prejudices
the
habits
and
the
passions
that
will
rule
his
life

entire
man
is

shadows
from
the
watch
the
full
african
moon
poured
down
its
light
from
the
blue
sky
into
the
wide
lonely
plain
the
dry
sandy
earth
with
its
coating
of
stunted
karoo
bushes
a
few
inches
high
the
low
hills
that
skirted
the
plain
the
with
their
long
leaves
all
were
touched
by
a
weird
and
an
almost
oppressive
beauty
as
they
lay
in
the
white
light
in
one
spot
only
was
the
solemn
monotony
of
the
plain
broken
near
the
centre
a
small
solitary
kopje
rose
alone
it
lay
there
a
heap
of
round
ironstones
piled
one
upon
another
as
over
some
giant
s
grave
here
and
there
a
few
tufts
of
grass
or
small
succulent
plants
had
sprung
up
among
its
stones
and
on
the
very
summit
a
clump
of
lifted
their
thorny
arms
and
reflected
as
from
mirrors
the
moonlight
on
their
broad
fleshy
leaves
at
the
foot
of
the
kopje
lay
the
homestead
first
the
sheep
kraals
and
kaffer
huts
beyond
them
the
a
square
building
with
thatched
roof
even
on
its
bare
red
walls
and
the
wooden
ladder
that
led
up
to
the
loft
the
moonlight
cast
a
kind
of
dreamy
beauty
and
quite
etherealized
the
low
brick
wall
that
ran
before
the
house
and
which
inclosed
a
bare
patch
of
sand
and
two
straggling
sunflowers
on
the
zinc
roof
of
the
great
open
on
the
roofs
of
the
outbuildings
that
jutted
from
its
side
the
moonlight
glinted
with
a
quite
peculiar
brightness
till
it
seemed
that
every
rib
in
the
metal
was
of
burnished
silver
sleep
ruled
everywhere
and
the
homestead
was
not
less
quiet
than
the
solitary
plain
in
the
farmhouse
on
her
great
wooden
bedstead
tant
sannie
the
rolled
heavily
in
her
sleep
she
had
gone
to
bed
as
she
always
did
in
her
clothes
and
the
night
was
warm
and
the
room
close
and
she
dreamed
bad
dreams
not
of
the
ghosts
and
devils
that
so
haunted
her
waking
thoughts
not
of
her
second
husband
the
consumptive
englishman
whose
grave
lay
away
beyond
the
nor
of
her
first
the
young
boer
but
only
of
the
sheep
s
trotters
she
had
eaten
for
supper
that
night
she
dreamed
that
one
stuck
fast
in
her
throat
and
she
rolled
her
huge
form
from
side
to
side
and
snorted
horribly
in
the
next
room
where
the
maid
had
forgotten
to
close
the
shutter
the
white
moonlight
fell
in
in
a
flood
and
made
it
light
as
day
there
were
two
small
beds
against
the
wall
in
one
lay
a
child
with
a
low
forehead
and
a
face
of
freckles
but
the
loving
moonlight
hid
defects
here
as
elsewhere
and
showed
only
the
innocent
face
of
a
child
in
its
first
sweet
sleep
the
figure
in
the
companion
bed
belonged
of
right
to
the
moonlight
for
it
was
of
quite
beauty
the
child
had
dropped
her
cover
on
the
floor
and
the
moonlight
looked
in
at
the
naked
little
limbs
presently
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
at
the
moonlight
that
was
bathing
her
em
she
called
to
the
sleeper
in
the
other
bed
but
received
no
answer
then
she
drew
the
cover
from
the
floor
turned
her
pillow
and
pulling
the
sheet
over
her
head
went
to
sleep
again
only
in
one
of
the
outbuildings
that
jutted
from
the
there
was
some
one
who
was
not
asleep
the
room
was
dark
door
and
shutter
were
closed
not
a
ray
of
light
entered
anywhere
the
german
overseer
to
whom
the
room
belonged
lay
sleeping
soundly
on
his
bed
in
the
corner
his
great
arms
folded
and
his
bushy
grey
and
black
beard
rising
and
falling
on
his
breast
but
one
in
the
room
was
not
asleep
two
large
eyes
looked
about
in
the
darkness
and
two
small
hands
were
smoothing
the
patchwork
quilt
the
boy
who
slept
on
a
box
under
the
window
had
just
awakened
from
his
first
sleep
he
drew
the
quilt
up
to
his
chin
so
that
little
peered
above
it
but
a
great
head
of
silky
black
curls
and
the
two
black
eyes
he
stared
about
in
the
darkness
nothing
was
visible
not
even
the
outline
of
one
rafter
nor
of
the
deal
table
on
which
lay
the
bible
from
which
his
father
had
read
before
they
went
to
bed
no
one
could
tell
where
the
toolbox
was
and
where
the
fireplace
there
was
something
very
impressive
to
the
child
in
the
complete
darkness
at
the
head
of
his
father
s
bed
hung
a
great
silver
hunting
watch
it
ticked
loudly
the
boy
listened
to
it
and
began
mechanically
to
count
tick
tick
one
two
three
four
he
lost
count
presently
and
only
listened
tick
tick
tick
tick
it
never
waited
it
went
on
inexorably
and
every
time
it
ticked
a
man
died
he
raised
himself
a
little
on
his
elbow
and
listened
he
wished
it
would
leave
off
how
many
times
had
it
ticked
since
he
came
to
lie
down
a
thousand
times
a
million
times
perhaps
he
tried
to
count
again
and
sat
up
to
listen
better
dying
dying
dying
said
the
watch
dying
dying
dying
he
heard
it
distinctly
where
were
they
going
to
all
those
people
he
lay
down
quickly
and
pulled
the
cover
up
over
his
head
but
presently
the
silky
curls
reappeared
dying
dying
dying
said
the
watch
dying
dying
dying
he
thought
of
the
words
his
father
had
read
that
evening
for
wide
is
the
gate
and
broad
is
the
way
that
leadeth
to
destruction
and
many
there
be
which
go
in
many
many
many
said
the
watch
because
strait
is
the
gate
and
narrow
is
the
way
that
leadeth
unto
life
and
few
there
be
that
find
few
few
few
said
the
watch
the
boy
lay
with
his
eyes
wide
open
he
saw
before
him
a
long
stream
of
people
a
great
dark
multitude
that
moved
in
one
direction
then
they
came
to
the
dark
edge
of
the
world
and
went
over
he
saw
them
passing
on
before
him
and
there
was
nothing
that
could
stop
them
he
thought
of
how
that
stream
had
rolled
on
through
all
the
long
ages
of
the
past
how
the
old
greeks
and
romans
had
gone
over
the
countless
millions
of
china
and
india
they
were
going
over
now
since
he
had
come
to
bed
how
many
had
gone
and
the
watch
said
eternity
eternity
eternity
stop
them
stop
them
cried
the
child
and
all
the
while
the
watch
kept
ticking
on
just
like
god
s
will
that
never
changes
or
alters
you
may
do
what
you
please
great
beads
of
perspiration
stood
on
the
boy
s
forehead
he
climbed
out
of
bed
and
lay
with
his
face
turned
to
the
mud
floor
oh
god
god
save
them
he
cried
in
agony
only
some
only
a
few
only
for
each
moment
i
am
praying
here
one
he
folded
his
little
hands
upon
his
head
god
god
save
them
he
grovelled
on
the
floor
oh
the
long
long
ages
of
the
past
in
which
they
had
gone
over
oh
the
long
long
future
in
which
they
would
pass
away
oh
god
the
long
long
long
eternity
which
has
no
end
the
child
wept
and
crept
closer
to
the
ground
the
sacrifice
the
farm
by
daylight
was
not
as
the
farm
by
moonlight
the
plain
was
a
weary
flat
of
loose
red
sand
sparsely
covered
by
dry
karoo
bushes
that
cracked
beneath
the
tread
like
tinder
and
showed
the
red
earth
everywhere
here
and
there
a
lifted
its
rods
and
in
every
direction
the
ants
and
beetles
ran
about
in
the
blazing
sand
the
red
walls
of
the
farmhouse
the
zinc
roofs
of
the
outbuildings
the
stone
walls
of
the
kraals
all
reflected
the
fierce
sunlight
till
the
eye
ached
and
blenched
no
tree
or
shrub
was
to
be
seen
far
or
near
the
two
sunflowers
that
stood
before
the
door
by
the
sun
drooped
their
brazen
faces
to
the
sand
and
the
little
insects
cried
aloud
among
the
stones
of
the
kopje
the
seen
by
daylight
was
even
less
lovely
than
when
in
bed
she
rolled
and
dreamed
she
sat
on
a
chair
in
the
great
front
room
with
her
feet
on
a
wooden
stove
and
wiped
her
flat
face
with
the
corner
of
her
apron
and
drank
coffee
and
in
cape
dutch
swore
that
the
beloved
weather
was
damned
less
lovely
too
by
daylight
was
the
dead
englishman
s
child
her
little
stepdaughter
upon
whose
freckles
and
low
wrinkled
forehead
the
sunlight
had
no
mercy
lyndall
the
child
said
to
her
little
orphan
cousin
who
sat
with
her
on
the
floor
threading
beads
how
is
it
your
beads
never
fall
off
your
needle
i
try
said
the
little
one
gravely
moistening
her
tiny
finger
that
is
the
overseer
seen
by
daylight
was
a
huge
german
wearing
a
shabby
suit
and
with
a
childish
habit
of
rubbing
his
hands
and
nodding
his
head
prodigiously
when
pleased
at
anything
he
stood
out
at
the
kraals
in
the
blazing
sun
explaining
to
two
kaffer
boys
the
approaching
end
of
the
world
the
boys
as
they
cut
the
cakes
of
dung
winked
at
each
other
and
worked
as
slowly
as
they
possibly
could
but
the
german
never
saw
it
away
beyond
the
kopje
waldo
his
son
herded
the
ewes
and
lambs
a
small
and
dusty
herd
powdered
all
over
from
head
to
foot
with
red
sand
wearing
a
ragged
coat
and
shoes
of
undressed
leather
through
whose
holes
the
toes
looked
out
his
hat
was
too
large
and
had
sunk
down
to
his
eyes
concealing
completely
the
silky
black
curls
it
was
a
curious
small
figure
his
flock
gave
him
little
trouble
it
was
too
hot
for
them
to
move
far
they
gathered
round
every
little
as
though
they
hoped
to
find
shade
and
stood
there
motionless
in
clumps
he
himself
crept
under
a
shelving
rock
that
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
kopje
stretched
himself
on
his
stomach
and
waved
his
dilapidated
little
shoes
in
the
air
soon
from
the
blue
bag
where
he
kept
his
dinner
he
produced
a
fragment
of
slate
an
arithmetic
and
a
pencil
proceeding
to
put
down
a
sum
with
solemn
and
earnest
demeanour
he
began
to
add
it
up
aloud
six
and
two
is
eight
and
four
is
twelve
and
two
is
fourteen
and
four
is
here
he
paused
and
four
is
eighteen
and
four
is
the
last
was
very
much
drawled
slowly
the
pencil
slipped
from
his
fingers
and
the
slate
followed
it
into
the
sand
for
a
while
he
lay
motionless
then
began
muttering
to
himself
folded
his
little
arms
laid
his
head
down
upon
them
and
might
have
been
asleep
but
for
the
muttering
sound
that
from
time
to
time
proceeded
from
him
a
curious
old
ewe
came
to
sniff
at
him
but
it
was
long
before
he
raised
his
head
when
he
did
he
looked
at
the
hills
with
his
heavy
eyes
ye
shall
receive
ye
shall
receive
shall
shall
shall
he
muttered
he
sat
up
then
slowly
the
dulness
and
heaviness
melted
from
his
face
it
became
radiant
midday
had
come
now
and
the
sun
s
rays
were
poured
down
vertically
the
earth
throbbed
before
the
eye
the
boy
stood
up
quickly
and
cleared
a
small
space
from
the
bushes
which
covered
it
looking
carefully
he
found
twelve
small
stones
of
somewhat
the
same
size
kneeling
down
he
arranged
them
carefully
on
the
cleared
space
in
a
square
pile
in
shape
like
an
altar
then
he
walked
to
the
bag
where
his
dinner
was
kept
in
it
was
a
mutton
chop
and
a
large
slice
of
brown
bread
the
boy
took
them
out
and
turned
the
bread
over
in
his
hand
deeply
considering
it
finally
he
threw
it
away
and
walked
to
the
altar
with
the
meat
and
laid
it
down
on
the
stones
close
by
in
the
red
sand
he
knelt
down
sure
never
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
was
there
so
ragged
and
so
small
a
priest
he
took
off
his
great
hat
and
placed
it
solemnly
on
the
ground
then
closed
his
eyes
and
folded
his
hands
he
prayed
aloud
oh
god
my
father
i
have
made
thee
a
sacrifice
i
have
only
twopence
so
i
can
not
buy
a
lamb
if
the
lambs
were
mine
i
would
give
thee
one
but
now
i
have
only
this
meat
it
is
my
dinner
meat
please
my
father
send
fire
down
from
heaven
to
burn
it
thou
hast
said
whosoever
shall
say
unto
this
mountain
be
thou
cast
into
the
sea
nothing
doubting
it
shall
be
done
i
ask
for
the
sake
of
jesus
christ
he
knelt
down
with
his
face
upon
the
ground
and
he
folded
his
hands
upon
his
curls
the
fierce
sun
poured
down
its
heat
upon
his
head
and
upon
his
altar
when
he
looked
up
he
knew
what
he
should
see
the
glory
of
god
for
fear
his
very
heart
stood
still
his
breath
came
heavily
he
was
half
suffocated
he
dared
not
look
up
then
at
last
he
raised
himself
above
him
was
the
quiet
blue
sky
about
him
the
red
earth
there
were
the
clumps
of
silent
ewes
and
his
altar
that
was
all
he
looked
up
nothing
broke
the
intense
stillness
of
the
blue
overhead
he
looked
round
in
astonishment
then
he
bowed
again
and
this
time
longer
than
before
when
he
raised
himself
the
second
time
all
was
unaltered
only
the
sun
had
melted
the
fat
of
the
little
mutton
chop
and
it
ran
down
upon
the
stones
then
the
third
time
he
bowed
himself
when
at
last
he
looked
up
some
ants
had
come
to
the
meat
on
the
altar
he
stood
up
and
drove
them
away
then
he
put
his
hat
on
his
hot
curls
and
sat
in
the
shade
he
clasped
his
hands
about
his
knees
he
sat
to
watch
what
would
come
to
pass
the
glory
of
the
lord
god
almighty
he
knew
he
should
see
it
my
dear
god
is
trying
me
he
said
and
he
sat
there
through
the
fierce
heat
of
the
afternoon
still
he
watched
and
waited
when
the
sun
began
to
slope
and
when
it
neared
the
horizon
and
the
sheep
began
to
cast
long
shadows
across
the
karoo
he
still
sat
there
he
hoped
when
the
first
rays
touched
the
hills
till
the
sun
dipped
behind
them
and
was
gone
then
he
called
his
ewes
together
and
broke
down
the
altar
and
threw
the
meat
far
far
away
into
the
field
he
walked
home
behind
his
flock
his
heart
was
heavy
he
reasoned
so
god
can
not
lie
i
had
faith
no
fire
came
i
am
like
cain
i
am
not
his
he
will
not
hear
my
prayer
god
hates
the
boy
s
heart
was
heavy
when
he
reached
the
kraal
gate
the
two
girls
met
him
come
said
the
em
let
us
play
coop
there
is
still
time
before
it
gets
quite
dark
you
waldo
go
and
hide
on
the
kopje
lyndall
and
i
will
shut
eyes
here
and
we
will
not
the
girls
hid
their
faces
in
the
stone
wall
of
the
and
the
boy
clambered
half
way
up
the
kopje
he
crouched
down
between
two
stones
and
gave
the
call
just
then
the
came
walking
out
of
the
with
two
pails
he
was
an
kaffer
ah
thought
the
boy
perhaps
he
will
die
tonight
and
go
to
hell
i
must
pray
for
him
i
must
pray
then
he
thought
where
am
i
going
to
and
he
prayed
desperately
ah
this
is
not
right
at
all
little
em
said
peeping
between
the
stones
and
finding
him
in
a
very
curious
posture
what
are
you
doing
waldo
it
is
not
the
play
you
know
you
should
run
out
when
we
come
to
the
white
stone
ah

not
play

i
will
play
nicely
now
said
the
boy
coming
out
and
standing
sheepishly
before
them
i
i
only
forgot
i
will
play
he
has
been
to
sleep
said
freckled
em
no
said
beautiful
little
lyndall
looking
curiously
at
him
he
has
been
she
never
made
a
mistake
the
confession
one
night
two
years
after
the
boy
sat
alone
on
the
kopje
he
had
crept
softly
from
his
father
s
room
and
come
there
he
often
did
because
when
he
prayed
or
cried
aloud
his
father
might
awake
and
hear
him
and
none
knew
his
great
sorrow
and
none
knew
his
grief
but
he
himself
and
he
buried
them
deep
in
his
heart
he
turned
up
the
brim
of
his
great
hat
and
looked
at
the
moon
but
most
at
the
leaves
of
the
prickly
pear
that
grew
just
before
him
they
glinted
and
glinted
and
glinted
just
like
his
own
heart
cold
so
hard
and
very
wicked
his
physical
heart
had
pain
also
it
seemed
full
of
little
bits
of
glass
that
hurt
he
had
sat
there
for
half
an
hour
and
he
dared
not
go
back
to
the
close
house
he
felt
horribly
lonely
there
was
not
one
thing
so
wicked
as
he
in
all
the
world
and
he
knew
it
he
folded
his
arms
and
began
to
cry
not
aloud
he
sobbed
without
making
any
sound
and
his
tears
left
scorched
marks
where
they
fell
he
could
not
pray
he
had
prayed
night
and
day
for
so
many
months
and
tonight
he
could
not
pray
when
he
left
off
crying
he
held
his
aching
head
with
his
brown
hands
if
one
might
have
gone
up
to
him
and
touched
him
kindly
poor
ugly
little
thing
perhaps
his
heart
was
almost
broken
with
his
swollen
eyes
he
sat
there
on
a
flat
stone
at
the
very
top
of
the
kopje
and
the
tree
with
every
one
of
its
wicked
leaves
blinked
and
blinked
and
blinked
at
him
presently
he
began
to
cry
again
and
then
stopped
his
crying
to
look
at
it
he
was
quiet
for
a
long
while
then
he
knelt
up
slowly
and
bent
forward
there
was
a
secret
he
had
carried
in
his
heart
for
a
year
he
had
not
dared
to
look
at
it
he
had
not
whispered
it
to
himself
but
for
a
year
he
had
carried
it
i
hate
god
he
said
the
wind
took
the
words
and
ran
away
with
them
among
the
stones
and
through
the
leaves
of
the
prickly
pear
he
thought
it
died
away
half
down
the
kopje
he
had
told
it
now
i
love
jesus
christ
but
i
hate
the
wind
carried
away
that
sound
as
it
had
done
the
first
then
he
got
up
and
buttoned
his
old
coat
about
him
he
knew
he
was
certainly
lost
now
he
did
not
care
if
half
the
world
were
to
be
lost
why
not
he
too
he
would
not
pray
for
mercy
any
more
better
so
better
to
know
certainly
it
was
ended
now
better
so
he
began
scrambling
down
the
sides
of
the
kopje
to
go
home
better
so
but
oh
the
loneliness
the
agonized
pain
for
that
night
and
for
nights
on
nights
to
come
the
anguish
that
sleeps
all
day
on
the
heart
like
a
heavy
worm
and
wakes
up
at
night
to
feed
there
are
some
of
us
who
in
after
years
say
to
fate
now
deal
us
your
hardest
blow
give
us
what
you
will
but
let
us
never
again
suffer
as
we
suffered
when
we
were
the
barb
in
the
arrow
of
childhood
s
suffering
is
this
its
intense
loneliness
its
intense
agony
chapter
plans
and
bushman
paintings
at
last
came
the
year
of
the
great
drought
the
year
of
from
end
to
end
of
the
land
the
earth
cried
for
water
man
and
beast
turned
their
eyes
to
the
pitiless
sky
that
like
the
roof
of
some
brazen
oven
arched
overhead
on
the
farm
day
after
day
month
after
month
the
water
in
the
dams
fell
lower
and
lower
the
sheep
died
in
the
fields
the
cattle
scarcely
able
to
crawl
tottered
as
they
moved
from
spot
to
spot
in
search
of
food
week
after
week
month
after
month
the
sun
looked
down
from
the
cloudless
sky
till
the
were
leafless
sticks
broken
into
the
earth
and
the
earth
itself
was
naked
and
bare
and
only
the
like
old
hags
pointed
their
shrivelled
fingers
heavenward
praying
for
the
rain
that
never
came
it
was
on
an
afternoon
of
a
long
day
in
that
thirsty
summer
that
on
the
side
of
the
kopje
furthest
from
the
homestead
the
two
girls
sat
they
were
somewhat
grown
since
the
days
when
they
played
there
but
they
were
mere
children
still
their
dress
was
of
dark
coarse
stuff
their
common
blue
pinafores
reached
to
their
ankles
and
on
their
feet
they
wore
velschoen
they
sat
under
a
shelving
rock
on
the
surface
of
which
were
still
visible
some
old
bushman
paintings
their
red
and
black
pigments
having
been
preserved
through
long
years
from
wind
and
rain
by
the
overhanging
ledge
grotesque
oxen
elephants
rhinoceroses
and
a
beast
such
as
no
man
ever
has
seen
or
ever
shall
the
girls
sat
with
their
backs
to
the
paintings
in
their
laps
were
a
few
fern
and
leaves
which
by
dint
of
much
searching
they
had
gathered
under
the
rocks
em
took
off
her
big
brown
kapje
and
began
vigorously
to
fan
her
red
face
with
it
but
her
companion
bent
low
over
the
leaves
in
her
lap
and
at
last
took
up
an
leaf
and
fastened
it
on
to
the
front
of
her
blue
pinafore
with
a
pin
diamonds
must
look
as
these
drops
do
she
said
carefully
bending
over
the
leaf
and
crushing
one
crystal
drop
with
her
delicate
little
nail
when
i
she
said
am
grown
up
i
shall
wear
real
diamonds
exactly
like
these
in
my
her
companion
opened
her
eyes
and
wrinkled
her
low
forehead
where
will
you
find
them
lyndall
the
stones
are
only
crystals
that
we
picked
up
yesterday
old
otto
says
and
you
think
that
i
am
going
to
stay
here
always
the
lip
trembled
scornfully
ah
no
said
her
companion
i
suppose
some
day
we
shall
go
somewhere
but
now
we
are
only
twelve
and
we
can
not
marry
till
we
are
seventeen
four
years
five
that
is
a
long
time
to
wait
and
we
might
not
have
diamonds
if
we
did
and
you
think
that
i
am
going
to
stay
here
till
then
well
where
are
you
going
asked
her
companion
the
girl
crushed
an
leaf
between
her
fingers
tant
sannie
is
a
miserable
old
woman
she
said
your
father
married
her
when
he
was
dying
because
he
thought
she
would
take
better
care
of
the
farm
and
of
us
than
an
english
woman
he
said
we
should
be
taught
and
sent
to
school
now
she
saves
every
farthing
for
herself
buys
us
not
even
one
old
book
she
does
not
us
why
because
she
is
afraid
of
your
father
s
ghost
only
this
morning
she
told
her
hottentot
that
she
would
have
beaten
you
for
breaking
the
plate
but
that
three
nights
ago
she
heard
a
rustling
and
a
grunting
behind
the
pantry
door
and
knew
it
was
your
father
coming
to
spook
her
she
is
a
miserable
old
woman
said
the
girl
throwing
the
leaf
from
her
but
i
intend
to
go
to
and
if
she
won
t
let
you
i
shall
make
how
the
child
took
not
the
slightest
notice
of
the
last
question
and
folded
her
small
arms
across
her
knees
but
why
do
you
want
to
go
lyndall
there
is
nothing
helps
in
this
world
said
the
child
slowly
but
to
be
very
wise
and
to
know
everything
to
be
but
i
should
not
like
to
go
to
school
persisted
the
small
freckled
face
and
you
do
not
need
to
when
you
are
seventeen
this
will
go
you
will
have
this
farm
and
everything
that
is
upon
it
for
your
own
but
i
said
lyndall
will
have
nothing
i
must
oh
lyndall
i
will
give
you
some
of
my
sheep
said
em
with
a
sudden
burst
of
pitying
generosity
i
do
not
want
your
sheep
said
the
girl
slowly
i
want
things
of
my
own
when
i
am
grown
up
she
added
the
flush
on
her
delicate
features
deepening
at
every
word
there
will
be
nothing
that
i
do
not
know
i
shall
be
rich
very
rich
and
i
shall
wear
not
only
for
best
but
every
day
a
pure
white
silk
and
little
like
the
lady
in
tant
sannie
s
bedroom
and
my
petticoats
will
be
embroidered
not
only
at
the
bottom
but
all
the
lady
in
tant
sannie
s
bedroom
was
a
gorgeous
creature
from
a
which
the
somewhere
obtaining
had
pasted
up
at
the
foot
of
her
bed
to
be
profoundly
admired
by
the
children
it
would
be
very
nice
said
em
but
it
seemed
a
dream
of
quite
too
transcendent
a
glory
ever
to
be
realized
at
this
instant
there
appeared
at
the
foot
of
the
kopje
two
figures
the
one
a
dog
white
and
sleek
one
yellow
ear
hanging
down
over
his
left
eye
the
other
his
master
a
lad
of
fourteen
and
no
other
than
the
boy
waldo
grown
into
a
heavy
slouching
youth
of
fourteen
the
dog
mounted
the
kopje
quickly
his
master
followed
slowly
he
wore
an
aged
jacket
much
too
large
for
him
and
rolled
up
at
the
wrists
and
as
of
old
a
pair
of
dilapidated
velschoens
and
a
felt
hat
he
stood
before
the
two
girls
at
last
what
have
you
been
doing
today
asked
lyndall
lifting
her
eyes
to
his
face
looking
after
ewes
and
lambs
below
the
dam
here
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
awkwardly
i
brought
them
for
there
were
a
few
green
blades
of
tender
grass
where
did
you
find
them
on
the
dam
she
fastened
them
beside
the
leaf
on
her
blue
pinafore
they
look
nice
there
said
the
boy
awkwardly
rubbing
his
great
hands
and
watching
her
yes
but
the
pinafore
spoils
it
all
it
is
not
he
looked
at
it
closely
yes
the
squares
are
ugly
but
it
looks
nice
upon
you
he
now
stood
silent
before
them
his
great
hands
hanging
loosely
at
either
side
some
one
has
come
today
he
mumbled
out
suddenly
when
the
idea
struck
him
who
asked
both
girls
an
englishman
on
what
does
he
look
like
asked
em
i
did
not
notice
but
he
has
a
very
large
nose
said
the
boy
slowly
he
asked
the
way
to
the
didn
t
he
tell
you
his
name
yes
bonaparte
bonaparte
said
em
why
that
is

my
wife
is
sick
in
the
middle
of
the
week
but
sundays
not
i
give
her
rice
and
beans
for
soup
it
is
a
funny
there
was
a
living
man
called
bonaparte
once
said
she
of
the
great
eyes
ah
yes
i
know
said
em
the
poor
prophet
whom
the
lions
ate
i
am
always
so
sorry
for
her
companion
cast
a
quiet
glance
upon
her
he
was
the
greatest
man
who
ever
lived
she
said
the
man
i
like
and
what
did
he
do
asked
em
conscious
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
and
that
her
prophet
was
not
the
man
he
was
one
man
only
one
said
her
little
companion
slowly
yet
all
the
people
in
the
world
feared
him
he
was
not
born
great
he
was
common
as
we
are
yet
he
was
master
of
the
world
at
last
once
he
was
only
a
little
child
then
he
was
a
lieutenant
then
he
was
a
general
then
he
was
an
emperor
when
he
said
a
thing
to
himself
he
never
forgot
it
he
waited
and
waited
and
waited
and
it
came
at
he
must
have
been
very
happy
said
em
i
do
not
know
said
lyndall
but
he
had
what
he
said
he
would
have
and
that
is
better
than
being
happy
he
was
their
master
and
all
the
people
were
white
with
fear
of
him
they
joined
together
to
fight
him
he
was
one
and
they
were
many
and
they
got
him
down
at
last
they
were
like
the
wild
cats
when
their
teeth
are
fast
in
a
great
dog
like
cowardly
wild
cats
said
the
child
they
would
not
let
him
go
there
were
many
he
was
only
one
they
sent
him
to
an
island
on
the
sea
a
lonely
island
and
kept
him
there
fast
he
was
one
man
and
they
were
many
and
they
were
terrified
at
him
it
was
glorious
said
the
child
and
what
then
said
em
then
he
was
alone
there
in
that
island
with
men
to
watch
him
always
said
her
companion
slowly
and
quietly
and
in
the
long
lonely
nights
he
used
to
lie
awake
and
think
of
the
things
he
had
done
in
the
old
days
and
the
things
he
would
do
if
they
let
him
go
again
in
the
day
when
he
walked
near
the
shore
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
sea
all
around
him
was
a
cold
chain
about
his
body
pressing
him
to
and
then
said
em
much
interested
he
died
there
in
that
island
he
never
got
it
is
rather
a
nice
story
said
em
but
the
end
is
it
is
a
terrible
hateful
ending
said
the
little
teller
of
the
story
leaning
forward
on
her
folded
arms
and
the
worst
is
it
is
true
i
have
noticed
added
the
child
very
deliberately
that
it
is
only
the
stories
that
end
nicely
the
true
ones
all
end
as
she
spoke
the
boy
s
dark
heavy
eyes
rested
on
her
face
you
have
read
it
have
you
not
he
nodded
yes
but
the
brown
history
tells
only
what
he
did
not
what
he
it
was
in
the
brown
history
that
i
read
of
him
said
the
girl
but
i
know
what
he
thought
books
do
not
tell
no
said
the
boy
slowly
drawing
nearer
to
her
and
sitting
down
at
her
feet
what
you
want
to
know
they
never
then
the
children
fell
into
silence
till
doss
the
dog
growing
uneasy
at
its
long
continuance
sniffed
at
one
and
the
other
and
his
master
broke
forth
suddenly
if
they
could
talk
if
they
could
tell
us
now
he
said
moving
his
hand
out
over
the
surrounding
objects
then
we
would
know
something
this
kopje
if
it
could
tell
us
how
it
came
here
the
physical
geography
says
he
went
on
most
rapidly
and
confusedly
that
what
were
dry
lands
now
were
once
lakes
and
what
i
think
is
this
these
low
hills
were
once
the
shores
of
a
lake
this
kopje
is
some
of
the
stones
that
were
at
the
bottom
rolled
together
by
the
water
but
there
is
this
how
did
the
water
come
to
make
one
heap
here
alone
in
the
centre
of
the
plain
it
was
a
ponderous
question
no
one
volunteered
an
answer
when
i
was
little
said
the
boy
i
always
looked
at
it
and
wondered
and
i
thought
a
great
giant
was
buried
under
it
now
i
know
the
water
must
have
done
it
but
how
it
is
very
wonderful
did
one
little
stone
come
first
and
stop
the
others
as
they
rolled
said
the
boy
with
earnestness
in
a
low
voice
more
as
speaking
to
himself
than
to
them
oh
waldo
god
put
the
little
kopje
here
said
em
with
solemnity
but
how
did
he
put
it
here
by
but
how
did
the
wanting
bring
it
here
because
it
the
last
words
were
uttered
with
the
air
of
one
who
produces
a
clinching
argument
what
effect
it
had
on
the
questioner
was
not
evident
for
he
made
no
reply
and
turned
away
from
her
drawing
closer
to
lyndall
s
feet
he
said
after
a
while
in
a
low
voice
lyndall
has
it
never
seemed
to
you
that
the
stones
were
talking
with
you
sometimes
he
added
in
a
yet
lower
tone
i
lie
under
there
with
my
sheep
and
it
seems
that
the
stones
are
really
speaking
speaking
of
the
old
things
of
the
time
when
the
strange
fishes
and
animals
lived
that
are
turned
into
stone
now
and
the
lakes
were
here
and
then
of
the
time
when
the
little
bushmen
lived
here
so
small
and
so
ugly
and
used
to
sleep
in
the
wild
dog
holes
and
in
the
sloots
and
eat
snakes
and
shot
the
bucks
with
their
poisoned
arrows
it
was
one
of
them
one
of
these
old
wild
bushmen
that
painted
those
said
the
boy
nodding
toward
the
pictures
one
who
was
different
from
the
rest
he
did
not
know
why
but
he
wanted
to
make
something
beautiful
he
wanted
to
make
something
so
he
made
these
he
worked
hard
very
hard
to
find
the
juice
to
make
the
paint
and
then
he
found
this
place
where
the
rocks
hang
over
and
he
painted
them
to
us
they
are
only
strange
things
that
make
us
laugh
but
to
him
they
were
very
the
children
had
turned
round
and
looked
at
the
pictures
he
used
to
kneel
here
naked
painting
painting
painting
and
he
wondered
at
the
things
he
made
himself
said
the
boy
rising
and
moving
his
hand
in
deep
excitement
now
the
boers
have
shot
them
all
so
that
we
never
see
a
little
yellow
face
peeping
out
among
the
he
paused
a
dreamy
look
coming
over
his
face
and
the
wild
bucks
have
gone
and
those
days
and
we
are
here
but
we
will
be
gone
soon
and
only
the
stones
will
lie
on
here
looking
at
everything
like
they
look
now
i
know
that
it
is
i
who
am
thinking
the
fellow
added
slowly
but
it
seems
as
though
it
were
they
who
are
talking
has
it
never
seemed
so
to
you
lyndall
no
it
never
seems
so
to
me
she
answered
the
sun
had
dipped
now
below
the
hills
and
the
boy
suddenly
remembering
the
ewes
and
lambs
started
to
his
feet
let
us
also
go
to
the
house
and
see
who
has
come
said
em
as
the
boy
shuffled
away
to
rejoin
his
flock
while
doss
ran
at
his
heels
snapping
at
the
ends
of
the
torn
trousers
as
they
fluttered
in
the
wind
chapter
i
was
a
stranger
and
ye
took
me
in
as
the
two
girls
rounded
the
side
of
the
kopje
an
unusual
scene
presented
itself
a
large
group
was
gathered
at
the
back
door
of
the
homestead
on
the
doorstep
stood
the
a
hand
on
each
hip
her
face
red
and
fiery
her
head
nodding
fiercely
at
her
feet
sat
the
yellow
hottentot
maid
her
satellite
and
around
stood
the
black
kaffer
maids
with
blankets
twisted
round
their
figures
two
who
stamped
mealies
in
a
wooden
block
held
the
great
stampers
in
their
hands
and
stared
stupidly
at
the
object
of
attraction
it
certainly
was
not
to
look
at
the
old
german
overseer
who
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
group
that
they
had
all
gathered
together
his
suit
grizzly
black
beard
and
grey
eyes
were
as
familiar
to
every
one
on
the
farm
as
the
red
gables
of
the
homestead
itself
but
beside
him
stood
the
stranger
and
on
him
all
eyes
were
fixed
ever
and
anon
the
newcomer
cast
a
glance
over
his
pendulous
red
nose
to
the
spot
where
the
stood
and
smiled
faintly
i
m
not
a
child

the
in
low
cape
dutch
and
i
wasn

my
farm
cried
tant
sannie
blowing
no
by
the
devil
no
not
though
he
had
red
there
the
german
overseer
mildly
interposed
that
the
man
was
not
a
tramp
but
a
highly
respectable
individual
whose
horse
had
died
by
an
accident
three
days
before
don
t
tell
me
cried
the
the
man
isn
t
born
that

take
me
in
if
he
d
had
money

t
he
have
bought

horse

thieves
liars
murderers
rome
s
priests
seducers
i

the
devil
in
his
nose
cried
tant
sannie
shaking
her
fist
at
him
and
to
come
walking
into
the
house
of
this
boer
s
child
and
shaking
hands
as
though
he
came
on
horseback
oh
no
no
the
stranger
took
off
his
hat
a
tall
battered
chimneypot
and
disclosed
a
bald
head
at
the
back
of
which
was
a
little
fringe
of
curled
white
hair
and
he
bowed
to
tant
sannie
what
does
she
remark
my
friend
he
inquired
turning
his
eyes
on
the
old
german
the
german
rubbed
his
old
hands
and
hesitated
ah
well
ah
the
dutch
you
know
do
not
like
people
who
walk
in
this
country
ah
my
dear
friend
said
the
stranger
laying
his
hand
on
the
german
s
arm
i
should
have
bought
myself
another
horse
but
crossing
five
days
ago
a
full
river
i
lost
my
purse
a
purse
with
five
hundred
pounds
in
it
i
spent
five
days
on
the
bank
of
the
river
trying
to
find
it
couldn
t
paid
a
kaffer
nine
pounds
to
go
in
and
look
for
it
at
the
risk
of
his
life
couldn
t
find
the
german
would
have
translated
this
information
but
the
gave
no
ear
no
no
he
goes
tonight
see
how
he
looks
at
me
a
poor
unprotected
female
if
he
wrongs
me
who
is
to
do
me
right
cried
tant
sannie
i
think
said
the
german
in
an
undertone
if
you
didn
t
look
at
her
quite
so
much
it
might
be
advisable
she
ah
she
might
imagine
that
you
liked
her
too
well
in
fact
ah
certainly
my
dear
friend
certainly
said
the
stranger
i
shall
not
look
at
saying
this
he
turned
his
nose
full
upon
a
small
kaffer
of
two
years
old
that
small
naked
son
of
ham
became
instantly
so
terrified
that
he
fled
to
his
mother
s
blanket
for
protection
howling
horribly
upon
this
the
newcomer
fixed
his
eyes
pensively
on
the
folding
his
hands
on
the
head
of
his
cane
his
boots
were
broken
but
he
still
had
the
cane
of
a
gentleman
you
vagabonds
se
engelschman
said
tant
sannie
looking
straight
at
him
this
was
a
near
approach
to
plain
english
but
the
man
contemplated
the
block
abstractedly
wholly
unconscious
that
any
antagonism
was
being
displayed
toward
him
you
might
not
be
a
scotchman
or
anything
of
that
kind
might
you
suggested
the
german
it
is
the
english
that
she
my
dear
friend
said
the
stranger
i
am
irish
every
inch
of
me
father
irish
mother
irish
i
ve
not
a
drop
of
english
blood
in
my
and
you
might
not
be
married
might
you
persisted
the
german
if
you
had
a
wife
and
children
now
dutch
people
do
not
like
those
who
are
not
ah
said
the
stranger
looking
tenderly
at
the
block
i
have
a
dear
wife
and
three
sweet
little
children
two
lovely
girls
and
a
noble
this
information
having
been
conveyed
to
the
she
after
some
further
conversation
appeared
slightly
mollified
but
remained
firm
to
her
conviction
that
the
man
s
designs
were
evil
for
dear
lord
she
cried
all
englishmen
are
ugly
but
was
there
ever
such
a
thing
with
broken
boots
and
crooked
eyes
before
take
him
to
your
room
she
cried
to
the
german
but
all
the
sin
he
does
i
lay
at
your
the
german
having
told
him
how
matters
were
arranged
the
stranger
made
a
profound
bow
to
tant
sannie
and
followed
his
host
who
led
the
way
to
his
own
little
room
i
thought
she
would
come
to
her
better
self
soon
the
german
said
joyously
tant
sannie
is
not
wholly
bad
far
from
it
then
seeing
his
companion
cast
a
furtive
glance
at
him
which
he
mistook
for
one
of
surprise
he
added
quickly
ah
yes
yes
we
are
all
a
primitive
people
here
not
very
lofty
we
deal
not
in
titles
every
one
is
tante
and
oom
aunt
and
uncle
this
may
be
my
room
he
said
opening
the
door
it
is
rough
the
room
is
rough
not
a
palace
not
quite
but
it
may
be
better
than
the
fields
a
little
better
he
said
glancing
round
at
his
companion
come
in
come
in
there
is
something
to
eat
a
mouthful
not
the
fare
of
emperors
or
kings
but
we
do
not
starve
not
yet
he
said
rubbing
his
hands
together
and
looking
round
with
a
pleased
smile
on
his
old
face
my
friend
my
dear
friend
said
the
stranger
seizing
him
by
the
hand
may
the
lord
bless
you
the
lord
bless
and
reward
you
the
god
of
the
fatherless
and
the
stranger
but
for
you
i
would
this
night
have
slept
in
the
fields
with
the
dews
of
heaven
upon
my
late
that
evening
lyndall
came
down
to
the
cabin
with
the
german
s
rations
through
the
tiny
square
window
the
light
streamed
forth
and
without
knocking
she
raised
the
latch
and
entered
there
was
a
fire
burning
on
the
hearth
and
it
cast
its
ruddy
glow
over
the
little
dingy
room
with
its
rafters
and
mud
floor
and
broken
whitewashed
walls
a
curious
little
place
filled
with
all
manner
of
articles
next
to
the
fire
was
a
great
toolbox
beyond
that
the
little
bookshelf
with
its
books
beyond
that
in
the
corner
a
heap
of
filled
and
empty
from
the
rafters
hung
down
straps
riems
old
boots
bits
of
harness
and
a
string
of
onions
the
bed
was
in
another
corner
covered
by
a
patchwork
quilt
of
faded
red
lions
and
divided
from
the
rest
of
the
room
by
a
blue
curtain
now
drawn
back
on
the
mantelshelf
was
an
endless
assortment
of
little
bags
and
stones
and
on
the
wall
hung
a
map
of
south
germany
with
a
red
line
drawn
through
it
to
show
where
the
german
had
wandered
this
place
was
the
one
home
the
girls
had
known
for
many
a
year
the
house
where
tant
sannie
lived
and
ruled
was
a
place
to
sleep
in
to
eat
in
not
to
be
happy
in
it
was
in
vain
she
told
them
they
were
grown
too
old
to
go
there
every
morning
and
evening
found
them
there
were
there
not
too
many
golden
memories
hanging
about
the
old
place
for
them
to
leave
it
long
winter
nights
when
they
had
sat
round
the
fire
and
roasted
potatoes
and
asked
riddles
and
the
old
man
had
told
of
the
little
german
village
where
fifty
years
before
a
little
german
boy
had
played
at
snowballs
and
had
carried
home
the
knitted
stockings
of
a
little
girl
who
afterward
became
waldo
s
mother
did
they
not
seem
to
see
the
german
peasant
girls
walking
about
with
their
wooden
shoes
and
yellow
braided
hair
and
the
little
children
eating
their
suppers
out
of
little
wooden
bowls
when
the
good
mothers
called
them
in
to
have
their
milk
and
potatoes
and
were
there
not
yet
better
times
than
these
moonlight
nights
when
they
romped
about
the
door
with
the
old
man
yet
more
a
child
than
any
of
them
and
laughed
till
the
old
roof
of
the
rang
or
best
of
all
were
there
not
warm
dark
starlight
nights
when
they
sat
together
on
the
doorstep
holding
each
other
s
hands
singing
german
hymns
their
voices
rising
clear
in
the
still
night
air
till
the
german
would
draw
away
his
hand
suddenly
to
wipe
quickly
a
tear
the
children
must
not
see
would
they
not
sit
looking
up
at
the
stars
and
talking
of
them
of
the
dear
southern
cross
red
fiery
mars
orion
with
his
belt
and
the
seven
mysterious
sisters
and
fall
to
speculating
over
them
how
old
are
they
who
dwelt
in
them
and
the
old
german
would
say
that
perhaps
the
souls
we
loved
lived
in
them
there
in
that
little
twinkling
point
was
perhaps
the
little
girl
whose
stockings
he
had
carried
home
and
the
children
would
look
up
at
it
lovingly
and
call
it
uncle
otto
s
then
they
would
fall
to
deeper
speculations
of
the
times
and
seasons
wherein
the
heavens
shall
be
rolled
together
as
a
scroll
and
the
stars
shall
fall
as
a
casteth
her
untimely
figs
and
there
shall
be
time
no
longer
when
the
son
of
man
shall
come
in
his
glory
and
all
his
holy
angels
with
in
lower
and
lower
tones
they
would
talk
till
at
last
they
fell
into
whispers
then
they
would
wish
good
night
softly
and
walk
home
hushed
and
quiet
tonight
when
lyndall
looked
in
waldo
sat
before
the
fire
watching
a
pot
which
simmered
there
with
his
slate
and
pencil
in
his
hand
his
father
sat
at
the
table
buried
in
the
columns
of
a
newspaper
and
the
stranger
lay
stretched
on
the
bed
in
the
corner
fast
asleep
his
mouth
open
his
great
limbs
stretched
out
loosely
betokening
much
weariness
the
girl
put
the
rations
down
upon
the
table
snuffed
the
candle
and
stood
looking
at
the
figure
on
the
bed
uncle
otto
she
said
presently
laying
her
hand
down
on
the
newspaper
and
causing
the
old
german
to
look
up
over
his
glasses
how
long
did
that
man
say
he
had
been
walking
since
this
morning
poor
fellow
a
gentleman
not
accustomed
to
walking
horse
died
poor
fellow
said
the
german
pushing
out
his
lip
and
glancing
commiseratingly
over
his
spectacles
in
the
direction
of
the
bed
where
the
stranger
lay
with
his
flabby
double
chin
and
broken
boots
through
which
the
flesh
shone
and
do
you
believe
him
uncle
otto
believe
him
why
of
course
i
do
he
himself
told
me
the
story
three
times
if
said
the
girl
slowly
he
had
walked
for
only
one
day
his
boots
would
not
have
looked
so
and
if
if
said
the
german
starting
up
in
his
chair
irritated
that
any
one
should
doubt
such
irrefragable
evidence
if
why
he
told
me
himself
look
how
he
lies
there
added
the
german
pathetically
worn
out
poor
fellow
we
have
something
for
him
though
pointing
with
his
forefinger
over
his
shoulder
to
the
saucepan
that
stood
on
the
fire
we
are
not
cooks
not
french
cooks
not
quite
but
it
s
drinkable
drinkable
i
think
better
than
nothing
i
think
he
added
nodding
his
head
in
a
jocund
manner
that
evinced
his
high
estimation
of
the
contents
of
the
saucepan
and
his
profound
satisfaction
therein
bish
bish
my
chicken
he
said
as
lyndall
tapped
her
little
foot
up
and
down
upon
the
floor
bish
bish
my
chicken
you
will
wake
he
moved
the
candle
so
that
his
own
head
might
intervene
between
it
and
the
sleeper
s
face
and
smoothing
his
newspaper
he
adjusted
his
spectacles
to
read
the
child
s
eyes
rested
on
the
figure
on
the
bed
then
turned
to
the
german
then
rested
on
the
figure
again
i
think
he
is
a
liar
good
night
uncle
otto
she
said
slowly
turning
to
the
door
long
after
she
had
gone
the
german
folded
his
paper
up
methodically
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
the
stranger
had
not
awakened
to
partake
of
the
soup
and
his
son
had
fallen
asleep
on
the
ground
taking
two
white
sheepskins
from
the
heap
of
sacks
in
the
corner
the
old
man
doubled
them
up
and
lifting
the
boy
s
head
gently
from
the
slate
on
which
it
rested
placed
the
skins
beneath
it
poor
lambie
poor
lambie
he
said
tenderly
patting
the
great
rough
head
tired
is
he
he
threw
an
overcoat
across
the
boy
s
feet
and
lifted
the
saucepan
from
the
fire
there
was
no
place
where
the
old
man
could
comfortably
lie
down
himself
so
he
resumed
his
seat
opening
a
bible
he
began
to
read
and
as
he
read
pleasant
thoughts
and
visions
thronged
on
him
i
was
a
stranger
and
ye
took
me
in
he
read
he
turned
again
to
the
bed
where
the
sleeper
lay
i
was
a
very
tenderly
the
old
man
looked
at
him
he
saw
not
the
bloated
body
nor
the
evil
face
of
the
man
but
as
it
were
under
deep
disguise
and
fleshly
concealment
the
form
that
long
years
of
dreaming
had
made
very
real
to
him
jesus
lover
and
is
it
given
to
us
weak
and
sinful
frail
and
erring
to
serve
thee
to
take
thee
in
he
said
softly
as
he
rose
from
his
seat
full
of
joy
he
began
to
pace
the
little
room
now
and
again
as
he
walked
he
sang
the
lines
of
a
german
hymn
or
muttered
broken
words
of
prayer
the
little
room
was
full
of
light
it
appeared
to
the
german
that
christ
was
very
near
him
and
that
at
almost
any
moment
the
thin
mist
of
earthly
darkness
that
clouded
his
human
eyes
might
be
withdrawn
and
that
made
manifest
of
which
the
friends
at
emmaus
beholding
it
said
it
is
the
lord
again
and
yet
again
through
the
long
hours
of
that
night
as
the
old
man
walked
he
looked
up
to
the
roof
of
his
little
room
with
its
blackened
rafters
and
yet
saw
them
not
his
rough
bearded
face
was
illuminated
with
a
radiant
gladness
and
the
night
was
not
shorter
to
the
dreaming
sleepers
than
to
him
whose
waking
dreams
brought
heaven
near
so
quickly
the
night
fled
that
he
looked
up
with
surprise
when
at
four
o
clock
the
first
grey
streaks
of
summer
dawn
showed
themselves
through
the
little
window
then
the
old
man
turned
to
rake
together
the
few
coals
that
lay
under
the
ashes
and
his
son
turning
on
the
sheepskins
muttered
sleepily
to
know
if
it
were
time
to
rise
lie
still
lie
still
i
would
only
make
a
fire
said
the
old
man
have
you
been
up
all
night
asked
the
boy
yes
but
it
has
been
short
very
short
sleep
again
my
chicken
it
is
yet
and
he
went
out
to
fetch
more
fuel
chapter
blessed
is
he
that
believeth
bonaparte
blenkins
sat
on
the
side
of
the
bed
he
had
wonderfully
revived
since
the
day
before
held
his
head
high
talked
in
a
full
sonorous
voice
and
ate
greedily
of
all
the
viands
offered
him
at
his
side
was
a
basin
of
soup
from
which
he
took
a
deep
draught
now
and
again
as
he
watched
the
fingers
of
the
german
who
sat
on
the
mud
floor
mending
the
bottom
of
a
chair
presently
he
looked
out
where
in
the
afternoon
sunshine
a
few
ostriches
might
be
seen
wandering
listlessly
about
and
then
he
looked
in
again
at
the
little
whitewashed
room
and
at
lyndall
who
sat
in
the
doorway
looking
at
a
book
then
he
raised
his
chin
and
tried
to
adjust
an
imaginary
finding
none
he
smoothed
the
little
grey
fringe
at
the
back
of
his
head
and
began
you
are
a
student
of
history
i
perceive
my
friend
from
the
study
of
these
volumes
that
lie
scattered
about
this
apartment
this
fact
has
been
made
evident
to
well
a
little
perhaps
it
may
be
said
the
german
meekly
being
a
student
of
history
then
said
bonaparte
raising
himself
loftily
you
will
doubtless
have
heard
of
my
great
of
my
celebrated
kinsman
napoleon
bonaparte
yes
yes
said
the
german
looking
up
i
sir
said
bonaparte
was
born
at
this
hour
on
an
april
afternoon
years
ago
the
nurse
sir
she
was
the
same
who
attended
when
the
duke
of
sutherland
was
born
brought
me
to
my
mother
there
is
only
one
name
for
this
child
she
said
he
has
the
nose
of
his
great
kinsman
and
so
bonaparte
blenkins
became
my
name
bonaparte
blenkins
yes
sir
said
bonaparte
there
is
a
stream
on
my
maternal
side
that
connects
me
with
a
stream
on
his
maternal
the
german
made
a
sound
of
astonishment
the
connection
said
bonaparte
is
one
which
could
not
be
easily
comprehended
by
one
unaccustomed
to
the
study
of
aristocratic
pedigrees
but
the
connection
is
is
it
possible
said
the
german
pausing
in
his
work
with
much
interest
and
astonishment
napoleon
an
irishman
yes
said
bonaparte
on
the
mother
s
side
and
that
is
how
we
are
related
there
wasn
t
a
man
to
beat
him
said
bonaparte
stretching
himself
not
a
man
except
the
duke
of
wellington
and
it
s
a
strange
coincidence
added
bonaparte
bending
forward
but
he
was
a
connection
of
mine
his
nephew
the
duke
of
wellington
s
nephew
married
a
cousin
of
mine
she
was
a
woman
see
her
at
one
of
the
court
balls
amber
satin
daisies
in
her
hair
worth
going
a
hundred
miles
to
look
at
her
often
seen
her
there
myself
sir
the
german
moved
the
leather
thongs
in
and
out
and
thought
of
the
strange
vicissitudes
of
human
life
which
might
bring
the
kinsman
of
dukes
and
emperors
to
his
humble
room
bonaparte
appeared
lost
among
old
memories
ah

duke
of
wellington

nephew

broke
forth
suddenly

he
had
only
one
fault
that
duke
of
wellington
s
nephew
said
bonaparte
observing
that
the
german
was
deeply
interested
in
every
word
he
was
a
coward

you
might
call
a
coward

never

said
bonaparte
fixing
his
crosswise

impressively

regular
exact
circle
the
marks
of
their
tails

left
in
the
snow

bear

ear
over

bonaparte
blenkins
waited
to
observe
what
effect
his
story
had
made
then
he
took
out
a
dirty
white
handkerchief
and
stroked
his
forehead
and
more
especially
his
eyes
it
always
affects
me
to

adventure
he
remarked
returning

draught

sighed
deeply

after
a
while
rousing
himself
i
shall
now
wander
in
the
benign
air
and
taste
the
gentle
cool
of
evening
the
stiffness
hovers
over
me
yet
exercise
is
so
saying
he
adjusted
his
hat
carefully
on
the
bald
crown
of
his
head
and
moved
to
the
door
after
he
had
gone
the
german
sighed
again
over
his
work
ah
lord
so
it
is
ah
he
thought
of
the
ingratitude
of
the
world
uncle
otto
said
the
child
in
the
doorway
did
you
ever
hear
of
ten
bears
sitting
on
their
tails
in
a
circle
well
not
of
ten
exactly
but
bears
do
attack
travellers
every
day
it
is
nothing
unheard
of
said
the
german
a
man
of
such
courage
too
terrible
experience
that
and
how
do
we
know
that
the
story
is
true
uncle
otto
the
german
s
ire
was
roused
that
is
what
i
do
hate
he
cried
know
that
is
true
how
do
you
know
that
anything
is
true
because
you
are
told
so
if
we
begin
to
question
everything
proof
proof
proof
what
will
we
have
to
believe
left
how
do
you
know
the
angel
opened
the
prison
door
for
peter
except
that
peter
said
so
how
do
you
know
that
god
talked
to
moses
except
that
moses
wrote
it
that
is
what
i
hate
the
girl
knit
her
brows
perhaps
her
thoughts
made
a
longer
journey
than
the
german
dreamed
of
for
mark
you
the
old
dream
little
how
their
words
and
lives
are
texts
and
studies
to
the
generation
that
shall
succeed
them
not
what
we
are
taught
but
what
we
see
makes
us
and
the
child
gathers
the
food
on
which
the
adult
feeds
to
the
end
when
the
german
looked
up
next
there
was
a
look
of
supreme
satisfaction
in
the
little
mouth
and
the
beautiful
eyes
what
dost
see
chicken
he
asked
the
child
said
nothing
and
an
agonizing
shriek
was
borne
on
the
afternoon
breeze
oh
god
my
god
i
am
killed
cried
the
voice
of
bonaparte
as
he
with
wide
open
mouth
and
shaking
flesh
fell
into
the
room
followed
by
a
ostrich
who
put
its
head
in
at
the
door
opened
its
beak
at
him
and
went
away
shut
the
door
shut
the
door
as
you
value
my
life
shut
the
door
cried
bonaparte
sinking
into
a
chair
his
face
blue
and
white
with
a
greenishness
about
the
mouth
ah
my
friend
he
said
tremulously
eternity
has
looked
me
in
the
face
my
life
s
thread
hung
upon
a
cord
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
said
bonaparte
seizing
the
german
s
arm
dear
dear
dear
said
the
german
who
had
closed
the
lower
half
of
the
door
and
stood
much
concerned
beside
the
stranger
you
have
had
a
fright
i
never
knew
so
young
a
bird
to
chase
before
but
they
will
take
dislikes
to
certain
people
i
sent
a
boy
away
once
because
a
bird
would
chase
him
ah
dear
dear
when
i
looked
round
said
bonaparte
the
red
and
yawning
cavity
was
above
me
and
the
reprehensible
paw
raised
to
strike
me
my
nerves
said
bonaparte
suddenly
growing
faint
always
delicate
highly
strung
are
broken
broken
you
could
not
give
a
little
wine
a
little
brandy
my
friend
the
old
german
hurried
away
to
the
bookshelf
and
took
from
behind
the
books
a
small
bottle
half
of
whose
contents
he
poured
into
a
cup
bonaparte
drained
it
eagerly
how
do
you
feel
now
asked
the
german
looking
at
him
with
much
sympathy
a
little
slightly
the
german
went
out
to
pick
up
the
battered
chimneypot
which
had
fallen
before
the
door
i
am
sorry
you
got
the
fright
the
birds
are
bad
things
till
you
know
them
he
said
sympathetically
as
he
put
the
hat
down
my
friend
said
bonaparte
holding
out
his
hand
i
forgive
you
do
not
be
disturbed
whatever
the
consequences
i
forgive
you
i
know
i
believe
it
was
with
no
that
you
allowed
me
to
go
out
give
me
your
hand
i
have
no
none
you
are
very
kind
said
the
german
taking
the
extended
hand
and
feeling
suddenly
convinced
that
he
was
receiving
magnanimous
forgiveness
for
some
great
injury
you
are
very
don
t
mention
it
said
bonaparte
he
knocked
out
the
crown
of
his
old
hat
placed
it
on
the
table
before
him
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
his
face
in
his
hands
and
contemplated
it
ah
my
old
friend
he
thus
apostrophized
the
hat
you
have
served
me
long
you
have
served
me
faithfully
but
the
last
day
has
come
never
more
shall
you
be
borne
upon
the
head
of
your
master
never
more
shall
you
protect
his
brow
from
the
burning
rays
of
summer
or
the
cutting
winds
of
winter
henceforth
must
your
master
go
old
hat
at
the
end
of
this
affecting
appeal
the
german
rose
he
went
to
the
box
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
out
of
it
he
took
a
black
hat
which
had
evidently
been
seldom
worn
and
carefully
preserved
it
s
not
exactly
what
you
may
have
been
accustomed
to
he
said
nervously
putting
it
down
beside
the
battered
chimneypot
but
it
might
be
of
some
use
a
protection
to
the
head
you
my
friend
said
bonaparte
you
are
not
following
my
advice
you
are
allowing
yourself
to
be
reproached
on
my
account
do
not
make
yourself
unhappy
no
i
shall
go
no
no
no
cried
the
german
energetically
i
have
no
use
for
the
hat
none
at
all
it
is
shut
up
in
the
then
i
will
take
it
my
friend
it
is
a
comfort
to
one
s
own
mind
when
you
have
unintentionally
injured
any
one
to
make
reparation
i
know
the
feeling
the
hat
may
not
be
of
that
refined
cut
of
which
the
old
one
was
but
it
will
serve
yes
it
will
serve
thank
you
said
bonaparte
adjusting
it
on
his
head
and
then
replacing
it
on
the
table
i
shall
lie
down
now
and
take
a
little
repose
he
added
i
much
fear
my
appetite
for
supper
will
be
i
hope
not
i
hope
not
said
the
german
reseating
himself
at
his
work
and
looking
much
concerned
as
bonaparte
stretched
himself
on
the
bed
and
turned
the
end
of
the
patchwork
quilt
over
his
feet
you
must
not
think
to
make
your
departure
not
for
many
days
said
the
german
presently
tant
sannie
gives
her
consent
and
my
friend
said
bonaparte
closing
his
eyes
sadly
you
are
kind
but
were
it
not
that
tomorrow
is
the
sabbath
weak
and
trembling
as
i
lie
here
i
would
proceed
on
my
way
i
must
seek
work
idleness
but
for
a
day
is
painful
work
labour
that
is
the
secret
of
all
true
happiness
he
doubled
the
pillar
under
his
head
and
watched
how
the
german
drew
the
leather
thongs
in
and
out
after
a
while
lyndall
silently
put
her
book
on
the
shelf
and
went
home
and
the
german
stood
up
and
began
to
mix
some
water
and
meal
for
as
he
stirred
them
with
his
hands
he
said
i
make
always
a
double
supply
on
saturday
night
the
hands
are
then
free
as
the
thoughts
for
the
blessed
sabbath
said
bonaparte
there
was
a
pause
bonaparte
twisted
his
eyes
without
moving
his
head
to
see
if
supper
were
already
on
the
fire
you
must
sorely
miss
the
administration
of
the
lord
s
word
in
this
desolate
spot
added
bonaparte
oh
how
love
i
thine
house
and
the
place
where
thine
honour
dwelleth
well
we
do
yes
said
the
german
but
we
do
our
best
we
meet
together
and
i
well
i
say
a
few
words
and
perhaps
they
are
not
wholly
lost
not
strange
coincidence
said
bonaparte
my
plan
always
was
the
same
was
in
the
free
state
once
solitary
farm
one
neighbour
every
sunday
i
called
together
friend
and
neighbour
child
and
servant
and
said
rejoice
with
me
that
we
may
serve
the
lord
and
then
i
addressed
them
ah
those
were
blessed
times
said
bonaparte
would
they
might
the
german
stirred
at
the
cakes
and
stirred
and
stirred
and
stirred
he
could
give
the
stranger
his
bed
and
he
could
give
the
stranger
his
hat
and
he
could
give
the
stranger
his
brandy
but
his
sunday
service
after
a
good
while
he
said
i
might
speak
to
tant
sannie
i
might
arrange
you
might
take
the
service
in
my
place
if
it
my
friend
said
bonaparte
it
would
give
me
the
profoundest
felicity
the
most
unbounded
satisfaction
but
in
these
habiliments
in
these
deteriorated
garments
it
would
not
be
possible
it
would
not
be
fitting
that
i
should
officiate
in
service
of
one
whom
for
respect
we
shall
not
name
no
my
friend
i
will
remain
here
and
while
you
are
assembling
yourselves
together
in
the
presence
of
the
lord
i
in
my
solitude
will
think
of
and
pray
for
you
no
i
will
remain
here
it
was
a
touching
picture
the
solitary
man
there
praying
for
them
the
german
cleared
his
hands
from
the
meal
and
went
to
the
chest
from
which
he
had
taken
the
black
hat
after
a
little
careful
feeling
about
he
produced
a
black
cloth
coat
trousers
and
waistcoat
which
he
laid
on
the
table
smiling
knowingly
they
were
of
new
shining
cloth
worn
twice
a
year
when
he
went
to
the
town
to
nachtmaal
he
looked
with
great
pride
at
the
coat
as
he
unfolded
it
and
held
it
up
it
s
not
the
latest
fashion
perhaps
not
a
west
end
cut
not
exactly
but
it
might
do
it
might
serve
at
a
push
try
it
on
try
it
on
he
said
his
old
grey
eyes
twinkling
with
pride
bonaparte
stood
up
and
tried
on
the
coat
it
fitted
admirably
the
waistcoat
could
be
made
to
button
by
ripping
up
the
back
and
the
trousers
were
perfect
but
below
were
the
ragged
boots
the
german
was
not
disconcerted
going
to
the
beam
where
a
pair
of
hung
he
took
them
off
dusted
them
carefully
and
put
them
down
before
bonaparte
the
old
eyes
now
fairly
brimmed
over
with
sparkling
enjoyment
i
have
only
worn
them
once
they
might
serve
they
might
be
bonaparte
drew
them
on
and
stood
upright
his
head
almost
touching
the
beams
the
german
looked
at
him
with
profound
admiration
it
was
wonderful
what
a
difference
feathers
made
in
the
bird

the
boy
waldo
kissed
the
pages
of
his
book
and
looked
up
far
over
the
flat
lay
the
kopje
a
mere
speck
the
sheep
wandered
quietly
from
bush
to
bush
the
stillness
of
the
early
sunday
rested
everywhere
and
the
air
was
fresh
he
looked
down
at
his
book
on
its
page
a
black
insect
crept
he
lifted
it
off
with
his
finger
then
he
leaned
on
his
elbow
watching
its
quivering
antennae
and
strange
movements
smiling
even
you
he
whispered
shall
not
die
even
you
he
loves
even
you
he
will
fold
in
his
arms
when
he
takes
everything
and
makes
it
perfect
and
when
the
thing
had
gone
he
smoothed
the
leaves
of
his
bible
somewhat
caressingly
the
leaves
of
that
book
had
dropped
blood
for
him
once
they
had
taken
the
brightness
out
of
his
childhood
from
between
them
had
sprung
the
visions
that
had
clung
about
him
and
made
night
horrible
thoughts
had
lifted
their
heads
had
shot
out
forked
tongues
at
him
asking
mockingly
strange
trivial
questions
that
he
could
not
answer
miserable
child
why
did
the
women
in
mark
see
only
one
angel
and
the
women
in
luke
two
could
a
story
be
told
in
opposite
ways
and
both
ways
be
true
could
it
could
it
then
again
is
there
nothing
always
right
and
nothing
always
wrong
could
jael
the
wife
of
heber
the
kenite
put
her
hand
to
the
nail
and
her
right
hand
to
the
workman
s
hammer
and
could
the
spirit
of
the
lord
chant
paeans
over
her
loud
paeans
high
paeans
set
in
the
book
of
the
lord
and
no
voice
cry
out
it
was
a
mean
and
dastardly
sin
to
lie
and
kill
the
trusting
in
their
sleep
could
the
friend
of
god
marry
his
own
sister
and
be
beloved
and
the
man
who
does
it
today
goes
to
hell
to
hell
was
there
nothing
always
right
or
always
wrong
those
leaves
had
dropped
blood
for
him
once
they
had
made
his
heart
heavy
and
cold
they
had
robbed
his
childhood
of
its
gladness
now
his
fingers
moved
over
them
caressingly
my
father
god
knows
my
father
knows
he
said
we
can
not
understand
he
after
a
while
he
whispered
smiling
i
heard
your
voice
this
morning
when
my
eyes
were
not
yet
open
i
felt
you
near
me
my
father
why
do
you
love
me
so
his
face
was
illuminated
in
the
last
four
months
the
old
question
has
gone
from
me
i
know
you
are
good
i
know
you
love
everything
i
know
i
know
i
know
i
could
not
have
borne
it
any
more
not
any
he
laughed
softly
and
all
the
while
i
was
so
miserable
you
were
looking
at
me
and
loving
me
and
i
never
knew
it
but
i
know
it
now
i
feel
it
said
the
boy
and
he
laughed
low
i
feel
it
he
laughed
after
a
while
he
began
partly
to
sing
partly
to
chant
the
disconnected
verses
of
hymns
those
which
spoke
his
gladness
many
times
over
the
sheep
with
their
senseless
eyes
turned
to
look
at
him
as
he
sang
at
last
he
lapsed
into
quiet
then
as
the
boy
lay
there
staring
at
bush
and
sand
he
saw
a
vision
he
had
crossed
the
river
of
death
and
walked
on
the
other
bank
in
the
lord
s
land
of
beulah
his
feet
sank
into
the
dark
grass
and
he
walked
alone
then
far
over
the
fields
he
saw
a
figure
coming
across
the
dark
green
grass
at
first
he
thought
it
must
be
one
of
the
angels
but
as
it
came
nearer
he
began
to
feel
what
it
was
and
it
came
closer
closer
to
him
and
then
the
voice
said
come
and
he
knew
surely
who
it
was
he
ran
to
the
dear
feet
and
touched
them
with
his
hands
yes
he
held
them
fast
he
lay
down
beside
them
when
he
looked
up
the
face
was
over
him
and
the
glorious
eyes
were
loving
him
and
they
two
were
there
alone
together
he
laughed
a
deep
laugh
then
started
up
like
one
suddenly
awakened
from
sleep
oh
god
he
cried
i
can
not
wait
i
can
not
wait
i
want
to
die
i
want
to
see
him
i
want
to
touch
him
let
me
die
he
folded
his
hands
trembling
how
can
i
wait
so
long
for
long
long
years
perhaps
i
want
to
die
to
see
him
i
will
die
any
death
oh
let
me
come
weeping
he
bowed
himself
and
quivered
from
head
to
foot
after
a
long
while
he
lifted
his
head
yes
i
will
wait
i
will
wait
but
not
long
do
not
let
it
be
very
long
jesus
king
i
want
you
oh
i
want
you
soon
soon

sat
still
staring
across
the
plain
with
his
tearful
eyes

casting
shy
glances
of
admiration
at
his
companion
at
the
front
door
bonaparte
removed
his
hat
with
much
dignity
raised
his
shirt
collar
and
entered
to
the
centre
table
he
walked
put
his
hat
solemnly
down
by
the
big
bible
and
bowed
his
head
over
it
in
silent
prayer
the
looked
at
the
hottentot
and
the
hottentot
looked
at
the
there
was
one
thing
on
earth
for
which
tant
sannie
had
a
profound
reverence
which
exercised
a
subduing
influence
over
her
which
made
her
for
the
time
a
better
woman
that
thing
was
new
shining
black
cloth
it
made
her
think
of
the
predikant
it
made
her
think
of
the
elders
who
sat
in
the
top
pew
of
the
church
on
sundays
with
the
hair
so
nicely
oiled
so
holy
and
respectable
with
their
little
coats
it
made
her
think
of
heaven
where
everything
was
so
holy
and
respectable
and
nobody
wore
tancord
and
the
littlest
angel
had
a
coat
she
wished
she
hadn
t
called
him
a
thief
and
a
roman
catholic
she
hoped
the
german
hadn
t
told
him
she
wondered
where
those
clothes
were
when
he
came
in
rags
to
her
door
there
was
no
doubt
he
was
a
very
respectable
man
a
gentleman
the
german
began
to
read
a
hymn
at
the
end
of
each
line
bonaparte
groaned
and
twice
at
the
end
of
every
verse
the
had
often
heard
of
persons
groaning
during
prayers
to
add
a
certain
poignancy
and
finish
to
them
old
jan
vanderlinde
her
mother
s
brother
always
did
it
after
he
was
converted
and
she
would
have
looked
upon
it
as
no
especial
sign
of
grace
in
any
one
but
to
groan
at
she
was
startled
she
wondered
if
he
remembered
that
she
shook
her
fist
in
his
face
this
was
a
man
of
god
they
knelt
down
to
pray
the
weighed
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
and
could
not
kneel
she
sat
in
her
chair
and
peeped
between
her
crossed
fingers
at
the
stranger
s
back
she
could
not
understand
what
he
said
but
he
was
in
earnest
he
shook
the
chair
by
the
back
rail
till
it
made
quite
a
little
dust
on
the
mud
floor
when
they
rose
from
their
knees
bonaparte
solemnly
seated
himself
in
the
chair
and
opened
the
bible
he
blew
his
nose
pulled
up
his
shirt
collar
smoothed
the
leaves
stroked
down
his
capacious
waistcoat
blew
his
nose
again
looked
solemnly
round
the
room
then
began
all
liars
shall
have
their
part
in
the
lake
which
burneth
with
fire
and
brimstone
which
is
the
second
having
read
this
portion
of
scripture
bonaparte
paused
impressively
and
looked
all
round
the
room
i
shall
not
my
dear
friends
he
said
long
detain
you
much
of
our
precious
time
has
already
fled
blissfully
from
us
in
the
voice
of
thanksgiving
and
the
tongue
of
praise
a
few
a
very
few
words
are
all
i
shall
address
to
you
and
may
they
be
as
a
rod
of
iron
dividing
the
bones
from
the
marrow
and
the
marrow
from
the
bones
in
the
first
place
what
is
a
liar
the
question
was
put
so
pointedly
and
followed
by
a
pause
so
profound
that
even
the
hottentot
man
left
off
looking
at
his
boots
and
opened
his
eyes
though
he
understood
not
a
word
i
repeat
said
bonaparte
what
is
a
liar
the
sensation
was
intense
the
attention
of
the
audience
was
riveted
have
you
any
of
you
ever
seen
a
liar
my
dear
friends
there
was
a
still
longer
pause
i
hope
not
i
truly
hope
not
but
i
will
tell
you
what
a
liar
is
i
knew
a
liar
once
a
little
boy
who
lived
in
cape
town
in
short
market
street
his
mother
and
i
sat
together
one
day
discoursing
about
our
souls
here
sampson
said
his
mother
go
and
buy
sixpence
of
meiboss
from
the
malay
round
the
when
he
came
back
she
said
how
much
have
you
got
five
he
said
he
was
afraid
if
he
said
six
and
a
half
she
d
ask
for
some
and
my
friends
that
was
a
lie
the
half
of
a
meiboss
stuck
in
his
throat
and
he
died
and
was
buried
and
where
did
the
soul
of
that
little
liar
go
to
my
friends
it
went
to
the
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
this
brings
me
to
the
second
point
of
my
discourse
what
is
a
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
i
will
tell
you
my
friends
said
bonaparte
condescendingly
the
imagination
unaided
can
not
conceive
it
but
by
the
help
of
the
lord
i
will
put
it
before
your
mind
s
eye
i
was
travelling
in
italy
once
on
a
time
i
came
to
a
city
called
rome
a
vast
city
and
near
it
is
a
mountain
which
spits
forth
fire
its
name
is
etna
now
there
was
a
man
in
that
city
of
rome
who
had
not
the
fear
of
god
before
his
eyes
and
he
loved
a
woman
the
woman
died
and
he
walked
up
that
mountain
spitting
fire
and
when
he
got
to
the
top
he
threw
himself
in
at
the
hole
that
is
there
the
next
day
i
went
up
i
was
not
afraid
the
lord
preserves
his
servants
and
in
their
hands
shall
they
bear
thee
up
lest
at
any
time
thou
fall
into
a
volcano
it
was
dark
night
when
i
got
there
but
in
the
fear
of
the
lord
i
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
yawning
abyss
and
looked
in
that
sight
that
sight
my
friends
is
impressed
upon
my
most
indelible
memory
i
looked
down
into
the
lurid
depths
upon
an
incandescent
lake
a
melted
fire
a
seething
sea
the
billows
rolled
from
side
to
side
and
on
their
fiery
crests
tossed
the
white
skeleton
of
the
suicide
the
heat
had
burnt
the
flesh
from
off
the
bones
they
lay
as
a
light
cork
upon
the
melted
fiery
waves
one
skeleton
hand
was
raised
upward
the
finger
pointing
to
heaven
the
other
with
outstretched
finger
pointing
downward
as
though
it
would
say
i
go
below
but
you
bonaparte
may
soar
i
gazed
i
stood
entranced
at
that
instant
there
was
a
crack
in
the
lurid
lake
it
swelled
expanded
and
the
skeleton
of
the
suicide
disappeared
to
be
seen
no
more
by
mortal
here
again
bonaparte
rested
and
then
continued
the
lake
of
melted
stone
rose
in
the
crater
it
swelled
higher
and
higher
at
the
side
it
streamed
forth
at
the
top
i
had
presence
of
mind
near
me
was
a
rock
i
stood
upon
it
the
fiery
torrent
was
vomited
out
and
streamed
on
either
side
of
me
and
through
that
long
and
terrible
night
i
stood
there
alone
upon
that
rock
the
glowing
fiery
lava
on
every
hand
a
monument
of
the
and
tender
providence
of
the
lord
who
spared
me
that
i
might
this
day
testify
in
your
ears
of
him
now
my
dear
friends
let
us
deduce
the
lessons
that
are
to
be
learnt
from
this
narrative
firstly
let
us
never
commit
suicide
the
man
is
a
fool
my
friends
that
man
is
insane
my
friends
who
would
leave
this
earth
my
friends
here
are
joys
innumerable
such
as
it
hath
not
entered
into
the
heart
of
man
to
understand
my
friends
here
are
clothes
my
friends
here
are
beds
my
friends
here
is
delicious
food
my
friends
our
precious
bodies
were
given
us
to
love
to
cherish
oh
let
us
do
so
oh
let
us
never
hurt
them
but
care
for
and
love
them
my
friends
every
one
was
impressed
and
bonaparte
proceeded
thirdly
let
us
not
love
too
much
if
that
young
man
had
not
loved
that
young
woman
he
would
not
have
jumped
into
mount
etna
the
good
men
of
old
never
did
so
was
jeremiah
ever
in
love
or
ezekiel
or
hosea
or
even
any
of
the
minor
prophets
no
then
why
should
we
be
thousands
are
rolling
in
that
lake
at
this
moment
who
would
say
it
was
love
that
brought
us
oh
let
us
think
always
of
our
own
souls
first
a
charge
to
keep
i
have
a
god
to
glorify
a
soul
to
save
and
fit
it
for
the
oh
beloved
friends
remember
the
little
boy
and
the
meiboss
remember
the
young
girl
and
the
young
man
remember
the
lake
the
fire
and
the
brimstone
remember
the
suicide
s
skeleton
on
the
pitchy
billows
of
mount
etna
remember
the
voice
of
warning
that
has
this
day
sounded
in
your
ears
and
what
i
say
to
you
i
say
to
all
watch
may
the
lord
add
his
blessings
here
the
bible
closed
with
a
tremendous
thud
tant
sannie
loosened
the
white
handkerchief
about
her
neck
and
wiped
her
eyes
and
the
coloured
girl
seeing
her
do
so
sniffled
the
did
not
understand
the
discourse
which
made
it
the
more
affecting
there
hung
over
it
that
inscrutable
charm
which
hovers
forever
for
the
human
intellect
over
the
incomprehensible
and
shadowy
when
the
last
hymn
was
sung
the
german
conducted
the
officiator
to
tant
sannie
who
graciously
extended
her
hand
and
offered
coffee
and
a
seat
on
the
sofa
leaving
him
there
the
german
hurried
away
to
see
how
the
little
he
had
left
at
home
was
advancing
and
tant
sannie
remarked
that
it
was
a
hot
day
bonaparte
gathered
her
meaning
as
she
fanned
herself
with
the
end
of
her
apron
he
bowed
low
in
acquiescence
a
long
silence
followed
tant
sannie
spoke
again
bonaparte
gave
her
no
ear
his
eye
was
fixed
on
a
small
miniature
on
the
opposite
wall
which
represented
tant
sannie
as
she
had
appeared
on
the
day
before
her
confirmation
fifteen
years
before
attired
in
green
muslin
suddenly
he
started
to
his
feet
walked
up
to
the
picture
and
took
his
stand
before
it
long
and
wistfully
he
gazed
into
its
features
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
was
deeply
moved
with
a
sudden
movement
as
though
no
longer
able
to
restrain
himself
he
seized
the
picture
loosened
it
from
its
nail
and
held
it
close
to
his
eyes
at
length
turning
to
the
he
said
in
a
voice
of
deep
emotion
you
will
i
trust
dear
madam
excuse
this
exhibition
of
my
feelings
but
this
this
little
picture
recalls
to
me
my
first
and
best
beloved
my
dear
departed
wife
who
is
now
a
saint
in
tant
sannie
could
not
understand
but
the
hottentot
maid
who
had
taken
her
seat
on
the
floor
beside
her
mistress
translated
the
english
into
dutch
as
far
as
she
was
able
ah
my
first
my
beloved
he
added
looking
tenderly
down
at
the
picture
oh
the
beloved
the
beautiful
lineaments
my
angel
wife
this
is
surely
a
sister
of
yours
madame
he
added
fixing
his
eyes
on
tant
sannie
the
dutchwoman
blushed
shook
her
head
and
pointed
to
herself
carefully
intently
bonaparte
looked
from
the
picture
in
his
hand
to
tant
sannie
s
features
and
from
the
features
back
to
the
picture
then
slowly
a
light
broke
over
his
countenance
he
looked
up
it
became
a
smile
he
looked
back
at
the
miniature
his
whole
countenance
was
effulgent
ah
yes
i
see
it
now
he
cried
turning
his
delighted
gaze
on
the
eyes
mouth
nose
chin
the
very
expression
he
cried
how
is
it
possible
i
did
not
notice
it
before
take
another
cup
of
coffee
said
tant
sannie
put
some
sugar
bonaparte
hung
the
picture
tenderly
up
and
was
turning
to
take
the
cup
from
her
hand
when
the
german
appeared
to
say
that
the
pudding
was
ready
and
the
meat
on
the
table
he
s
a
man
and
one
who
knows
how
to
behave
himself
said
the
as
he
went
out
at
the
door
if
he
s
ugly
did
not
the
lord
make
him
and
are
we
to
laugh
at
the
lord
s
handiwork
it
is
better
to
be
ugly
and
good
than
pretty
and
bad
though
of
course
it
s
nice
when
one
is
both
said
tant
sannie
looking
complacently
at
the
picture
on
the
wall
in
the
afternoon
the
german
and
bonaparte
sat
before
the
door
of
the
cabin
both
smoked
in
complete
silence
bonaparte
with
a
book
in
his
hands
and
his
eyes
half
closed
the
german
puffing
vigorously
and
glancing
up
now
and
again
at
the
serene
blue
sky
overhead
supposing
you
you
in
fact
made
the
remark
to
me
burst
forth
the
german
suddenly
that
you
were
looking
for
a
bonaparte
opened
his
mouth
wide
and
sent
a
stream
of
smoke
through
his
lips
now
supposing
said
the
german
merely
supposing
of
course
that
some
one
some
one
in
fact
should
make
an
offer
to
you
say
to
become
schoolmaster
on
their
farm
and
teach
two
children
two
little
girls
perhaps
and
would
give
you
forty
pounds
a
year
would
you
accept
it
just
supposing
of
well
my
dear
friend
said
bonaparte
that
would
depend
on
circumstances
money
is
no
consideration
with
me
for
my
wife
i
have
made
provision
for
the
next
year
my
health
is
broken
could
i
meet
a
place
where
a
gentleman
would
be
treated
as
a
gentleman
i
would
accept
it
however
small
the
remuneration
with
me
said
bonaparte
money
is
no
well
said
the
german
when
he
had
taken
a
whiff
or
two
more
from
his
pipe
i
think
i
shall
go
up
and
see
tant
sannie
a
little
i
go
up
often
on
sunday
afternoon
to
have
a
general
conversation
to
see
her
you
know
nothing
nothing
particular
you
the
old
man
put
his
book
into
his
pocket
and
walked
up
to
the
farmhouse
with
a
peculiarly
knowing
and
delighted
expression
of
countenance
he
doesn
t
suspect
what
i
m
going
to
do
soliloquized
the
german
hasn
t
the
least
idea
a
nice
surprise
for
the
man
whom
he
had
left
at
his
doorway
winked
at
the
retreating
figure
with
a
wink
that
was
not
to
be
described
chapter
bonaparte
blenkins
makes
his
nest
ah
what
is
the
matter
asked
waldo
stopping
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
with
a
load
of
skins
on
his
back
that
he
was
carrying
up
to
the
loft
through
the
open
door
in
the
gable
little
em
was
visible
her
feet
dangling
from
the
high
bench
on
which
she
sat
the
room
once
a
storeroom
had
been
divided
by
a
row
of
mealie
bags
into
two
parts
the
back
being
bonaparte
s
bedroom
the
front
his
schoolroom
lyndall
made
him
angry
said
the
girl
tearfully
and
he
has
given
me
the
fourteenth
of
john
to
learn
he
says
he
will
teach
me
to
behave
myself
when
lyndall
troubles
what
did
she
do
asked
the
boy
you
see
said
em
hopelessly
turning
the
leaves
whenever
he
talks
she
looks
out
at
the
door
as
though
she
did
not
hear
him
today
she
asked
him
what
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
were
and
he
said
he
was
surprised
that
she
should
ask
him
it
was
not
a
fit
and
proper
thing
for
little
girls
to
talk
about
then
she
asked
him
who
copernicus
was
and
he
said
he
was
one
of
the
emperors
of
rome
who
burned
the
christians
in
a
golden
pig
and
the
worms
ate
him
up
while
he
was
still
alive
i
don
t
know
why
said
em
plaintively
but
she
just
put
her
books
under
her
arm
and
walked
out
and
she
will
never
come
to
his
school
again
she
says
and
she
always
does
what
she
says
and
now
i
must
sit
here
every
day
alone
said
em
the
great
tears
dropping
softly
perhaps
tant
sannie
will
send
him
away
said
the
boy
in
his
mumbling
way
trying
to
comfort
her
no
said
em
shaking
her
head
no
last
night
when
the
little
hottentot
maid
was
washing
her
feet
he
told
her
he
liked
such
feet
and
that
fat
women
were
so
nice
to
him
and
she
said
i
must
always
put
pure
cream
in
his
coffee
now
no
he
ll
never
go
away
said
em
dolorously
the
boy
put
down
his
skins
and
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
produced
a
small
piece
of
paper
containing
something
he
stuck
it
out
toward
her
there
take
it
for
you
he
said
this
was
by
way
of
comfort
em
opened
it
and
found
a
small
bit
of
gum
a
commodity
prized
by
the
children
but
the
great
tears
dropped
down
slowly
on
to
it
waldo
was
distressed
he
had
cried
so
much
in
his
morsel
of
life
that
tears
in
another
seemed
to
burn
him
if
he
said
stepping
in
awkwardly
and
standing
by
the
table
if
you
will
not
cry
i
will
tell
you
something
a
what
is
that
asked
em
instantly
becoming
decidedly
better
you
will
tell
it
to
no
human
being
he
bent
nearer
to
her
and
with
deep
solemnity
said
i
have
made
a
machine
em
opened
her
eyes
yes
a
machine
for
shearing
sheep
it
is
almost
done
said
the
boy
there
is
only
one
thing
that
is
not
right
yet
but
it
will
be
soon
when
you
think
and
think
and
think
all
night
and
all
day
it
comes
at
last
he
added
mysteriously
where
is
it
here
i
always
carry
it
here
said
the
boy
putting
his
hand
to
his
breast
where
a
was
visible
this
is
a
model
when
it
is
done
they
will
have
to
make
a
large
show
it
the
boy
shook
his
head
no
not
till
it
is
done
i
can
not
let
any
human
being
see
it
till
it
is
a
beautiful
secret
said
em
and
the
boy
shuffled
out
to
pick
up
his
skins
that
evening
father
and
son
sat
in
the
cabin
eating
their
supper
the
father
sighed
deeply
sometimes
perhaps
he
thought
how
long
a
time
it
was
since
bonaparte
had
visited
the
cabin
but
his
son
was
in
that
land
in
which
sighs
have
no
part
it
is
a
question
whether
it
were
not
better
to
be
the
shabbiest
of
fools
and
know
the
way
up
the
little
stair
of
imagination
to
the
land
of
dreams
than
the
wisest
of
men
who
see
nothing
that
the
eyes
do
not
show
and
feel
nothing
that
the
hands
do
not
touch
the
boy
chewed
his
brown
bread
and
drank
his
coffee
but
in
truth
he
saw
only
his
machine
finished
that
last
something
found
out
and
added
he
saw
it
as
it
worked
with
beautiful
smoothness
and
over
and
above
as
he
chewed
his
bread
and
drank
his
coffee
there
was
that
delightful
consciousness
of
something
bending
over
him
and
loving
him
it
would
not
have
been
better
in
one
of
the
courts
of
heaven
where
the
walls
are
set
with
rows
of
the
king
of
glory
s
amethysts
and
pearls
than
there
eating
his
supper
in
that
little
room
as
they
sat
in
silence
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
when
it
was
opened
the
small
woolly
head
of
a
little
nigger
showed
itself
she
was
a
messenger
from
tant
sannie
the
german
was
wanted
at
once
at
the
homestead
putting
on
his
hat
with
both
hands
he
hurried
off
the
kitchen
was
in
darkness
but
in
the
pantry
beyond
tant
sannie
and
her
maids
were
assembled
a
kaffer
girl
who
had
been
grinding
pepper
between
two
stones
knelt
on
the
floor
the
lean
hottentot
stood
with
a
brass
candlestick
in
her
hand
and
tant
sannie
near
the
shelf
with
a
hand
on
each
hip
was
evidently
listening
intently
as
were
her
companions
what
may
be
it
cried
the
old
german
in
astonishment
the
room
beyond
the
pantry
was
the
storeroom
through
the
thin
wooden
partition
there
arose
at
that
instant
evidently
from
some
creature
ensconced
there
a
prolonged
and
prodigious
howl
followed
by
a
succession
of
violent
blows
against
the
partition
wall
the
german
seized
the
and
was
about
to
rush
round
the
house
when
the
impressively
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
that
is
his
head
said
tant
sannie
that
is
his
but
what
might
it
be
asked
the
german
looking
from
one
to
the
other
in
hand
a
low
hollow
bellow
prevented
reply
and
the
voice
of
bonaparte
lifted
itself
on
high
my
angel
my
wife
isn
t
it
dreadful
said
tant
sannie
as
the
blows
were
repeated
fiercely
he
has
got
a
letter
his
wife
is
dead
you
must
go
and
comfort
him
said
tant
sannie
at
last
and
i
will
go
with
you
it
would
not
be
the
thing
for
me
to
go
alone
me
who
am
only
and
he
an
unmarried
man
now
said
tant
sannie
blushing
and
smoothing
out
her
apron
upon
this
they
all
trudged
round
the
house
in
company
the
hottentot
maid
carrying
the
light
tant
sannie
and
the
german
following
and
the
kaffer
girl
bringing
up
the
rear
oh
said
tant
sannie
i
see
now
it
wasn
t
wickedness
made
him
do
without
his
wife
so
long
only
at
the
door
she
motioned
to
the
german
to
enter
and
followed
him
closely
on
the
stretcher
behind
the
sacks
bonaparte
lay
on
his
face
his
head
pressed
into
a
pillow
his
legs
kicking
gently
the
sat
down
on
a
box
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
the
german
stood
with
folded
hands
looking
on
we
must
all
die
said
tant
sannie
at
last
it
is
the
dear
lord
s
hearing
her
voice
bonaparte
turned
himself
on
to
his
back
it
s
very
hard
said
tant
sannie
i
know
for
i
ve
lost
two
bonaparte
looked
up
into
the
german
s
face
oh
what
does
she
say
speak
to
me
words
of
comfort
the
german
repeated
tant
sannie
s
remark
ah
i
i
also
two
dear
dear
wives
whom
i
shall
never
see
any
more
cried
bonaparte
flinging
himself
back
upon
the
bed
he
howled
till
the
tarantulas
who
lived
between
the
rafters
and
the
zinc
roof
felt
the
unusual
vibration
and
looked
out
with
their
wicked
bright
eyes
to
see
what
was
going
on
tant
sannie
sighed
the
hottentot
maid
sighed
the
kaffer
girl
who
looked
in
at
the
door
put
her
hand
over
her
mouth
and
said
you
must
trust
in
the
lord
said
tant
sannie
he
can
give
you
more
than
you
have
i
do
i
do
he
cried
but
oh
i
have
no
wife
i
have
no
wife
tant
sannie
was
much
affected
and
came
and
stood
near
the
bed
ask
him
if
he
won
t
have
a
little
pap
nice
fine
flour
pap
there
is
some
boiling
on
the
kitchen
the
german
made
the
proposal
but
the
widower
waved
his
hand
no
nothing
shall
pass
my
lips
i
should
be
suffocated
no
no
speak
not
of
food
to
me
pap
and
a
little
brandy
in
said
tant
sannie
coaxingly
bonaparte
caught
the
word
perhaps
perhaps
if
i
struggled
with
myself
for
the
sake
of
my
duties
i
might
imbibe
a
few
drops
he
said
looking
with
quivering
lip
up
into
the
german
s
face
i
must
do
my
duty
must
i
not
tant
sannie
gave
the
order
and
the
girl
went
for
the
pap
i
know
how
it
was
when
my
first
husband
died
they
could
do
nothing
with
me
the
said
till
i
had
eaten
a
sheep
s
trotter
and
honey
and
a
little
i
bonaparte
sat
up
on
the
bed
with
his
legs
stretched
out
in
front
of
him
and
a
hand
on
each
knee
blubbering
softly
oh
she
was
a
woman
you
are
very
kind
to
try
and
comfort
me
but
she
was
my
wife
for
a
woman
that
is
my
wife
i
could
live
for
the
woman
that
is
my
wife
i
could
die
for
a
woman
that
is
my
wife
i
could
ah
that
sweet
word
wife
when
will
it
rest
upon
my
lips
again
when
his
feelings
had
subsided
a
little
he
raised
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
spoke
to
the
german
with
flabby
lips
do
you
think
she
understands
me
oh
tell
her
every
word
that
she
may
know
i
thank
at
that
instant
the
girl
reappeared
with
a
basin
of
steaming
gruel
and
a
black
bottle
tant
sannie
poured
some
of
its
contents
into
the
basin
stirred
it
well
and
came
to
the
bed
oh
i
can
t
i
can
t
i
shall
die
i
shall
die
said
bonaparte
putting
his
hands
to
his
side
come
just
a
little
said
tant
sannie
coaxingly
just
a
it
s
too
thick
it
s
too
thick
i
should
tant
sannie
added
from
the
contents
of
the
bottle
and
held
out
a
spoonful
bonaparte
opened
his
mouth
like
a
little
bird
waiting
for
a
worm
and
held
it
open
as
she
dipped
again
and
again
into
the
pap
ah
this
will
do
your
heart
good
said
tant
sannie
in
whose
mind
the
relative
functions
of
heart
and
stomach
were
exceedingly
when
the
basin
was
emptied
the
violence
of
his
grief
was
much
assuaged
he
looked
at
tant
sannie
with
gentle
tears
tell
him
said
the
that
i
hope
he
will
sleep
well
and
that
the
lord
will
comfort
him
as
the
lord
only
bless
you
dear
friend
god
bless
you
said
bonaparte
when
the
door
was
safely
shut
on
the
german
the
hottentot
and
the
dutchwoman
he
got
off
the
bed
and
washed
away
the
soap
he
had
rubbed
on
his
eyelids
bon
he
said
slapping
his
leg
you
re
the
cutest
lad
i
ever
came
across
if
you
don
t
turn
out
the
old
and
pummel
the
ragged
coat
and
get
your
arms
round
the
fat
one
s
waist
and
a
on
her
finger
then
you
are
not
bonaparte
but
you
are
bonaparte
bon
you
re
a
fine
boy
making
which
pleasing
reflection
he
pulled
off
his
trousers
and
got
into
bed
cheerfully
chapter
he
sets
his
trap
may
i
come
in
i
hope
i
do
not
disturb
you
my
dear
friend
said
bonaparte
late
one
evening
putting
his
nose
in
at
the
cabin
door
where
the
german
and
his
son
sat
finishing
their
supper
it
was
now
two
months
since
he
had
been
installed
as
schoolmaster
in
tant
sannie
s
household
and
he
had
grown
mighty
and
more
mighty
day
by
day
he
visited
the
cabin
no
more
sat
close
to
tant
sannie
drinking
coffee
all
the
evening
and
walked
about
loftily
with
his
hands
under
the
of
the
german
s
black
cloth
and
failed
to
see
even
a
nigger
who
wished
him
a
deferential
good
morning
it
was
therefore
with
no
small
surprise
that
the
german
perceived
bonaparte
s
red
nose
at
the
door
walk
in
walk
in
he
said
joyfully
boy
boy
see
if
there
is
any
coffee
left
well
none
make
a
fire
we
have
done
supper
but
my
dear
friend
said
bonaparte
taking
off
his
hat
i
came
not
to
sup
not
for
mere
creature
comforts
but
for
an
hour
of
brotherly
intercourse
with
a
kindred
spirit
the
press
of
business
and
the
weight
of
thought
but
they
alone
may
sometimes
prevent
me
from
sharing
the
secrets
of
my
bosom
with
him
for
whom
i
have
so
great
a
sympathy
you
perhaps
wonder
when
i
shall
return
the
two
pounds
oh
no
no
make
a
fire
make
a
fire
boy
we
will
have
a
pot
of
hot
coffee
presently
said
the
german
rubbing
his
hands
and
looking
about
not
knowing
how
best
to
show
his
pleasure
at
the
unexpected
visit
for
three
weeks
the
german
s
diffident
good
evening
had
met
with
a
stately
bow
the
chin
of
bonaparte
lifting
itself
higher
daily
and
his
shadow
had
not
darkened
the
cabin
doorway
since
he
came
to
borrow
the
two
pounds
the
german
walked
to
the
head
of
the
bed
and
took
down
a
blue
bag
that
hung
there
blue
bags
were
a
speciality
of
the
german
s
he
kept
above
fifty
stowed
away
in
different
corners
of
his
room
some
filled
with
curious
stones
some
with
seeds
that
had
been
in
his
possession
fifteen
years
some
with
rusty
nails
buckles
and
bits
of
old
harness
in
all
a
wonderful
assortment
but
highly
prized
we
have
something
here
not
so
bad
said
the
german
smiling
knowingly
as
he
dived
his
hand
into
the
bag
and
took
out
a
handful
of
almonds
and
raisins
i
buy
these
for
my
chickens
they
increase
in
size
but
they
still
think
the
old
man
must
have
something
nice
for
them
and
the
old
man
well
a
big
boy
may
have
a
sweet
tooth
sometimes
may
he
not
ha
ha
said
the
german
chuckling
at
his
own
joke
as
he
heaped
the
plate
with
almonds
here
is
a
stone
two
stones
to
crack
them
no
late
patent
improvement
well
adam
s
ha
ha
but
i
think
we
shall
do
we
will
not
leave
them
uncracked
we
will
consume
a
few
without
fashionable
here
the
german
sat
down
on
one
side
of
the
table
bonaparte
on
the
other
each
one
with
a
couple
of
flat
stones
before
him
and
the
plate
between
them
do
not
be
afraid
said
the
german
do
not
be
afraid
i
do
not
forget
the
boy
at
the
fire
i
crack
for
him
the
bag
is
full
why
this
is
strange
he
said
suddenly
cracking
upon
a
large
nut
three
kernels
i
have
not
observed
that
before
this
must
be
retained
this
is
he
wrapped
the
nut
gravely
in
paper
and
put
it
carefully
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
valuable
very
valuable
he
said
shaking
his
head
ah
my
friend
said
bonaparte
what
joy
it
is
to
be
once
more
in
your
the
german
s
eyes
glistened
and
bonaparte
seized
his
hand
and
squeezed
it
warmly
they
then
proceeded
to
crack
and
eat
after
a
while
bonaparte
said
stuffing
a
handful
of
raisins
into
his
mouth
i
was
so
deeply
grieved
my
dear
friend
that
you
and
tant
sannie
had
some
slight
unpleasantness
this
oh
no
no
said
the
german
it
is
all
right
now
a
few
sheep
missing
but
i
make
it
good
myself
i
give
my
twelve
sheep
and
work
in
the
other
it
is
rather
hard
that
you
should
have
to
make
good
the
lost
sheep
said
bonaparte
it
is
no
fault
of
well
said
the
german
this
is
the
case
last
evening
i
count
the
sheep
at
the
kraal
twenty
are
missing
i
ask
the
herd
he
tells
me
they
are
with
the
other
flock
he
tells
me
so
distinctly
how
can
i
think
he
lies
this
afternoon
i
count
the
other
flock
the
sheep
are
not
there
i
come
back
here
the
herd
is
gone
the
sheep
are
gone
but
i
can
not
no
i
will
not
believe
he
stole
them
said
the
german
growing
suddenly
excited
some
one
else
but
not
he
i
know
that
boy
i
knew
him
three
years
he
is
a
good
boy
i
have
seen
him
deeply
affected
on
account
of
his
soul
and
she
would
send
the
police
after
him
i
say
i
would
rather
make
the
loss
good
myself
i
will
not
have
it
he
has
fled
in
fear
i
know
his
heart
it
was
said
the
german
with
a
little
gentle
hesitation
under
my
words
that
he
first
felt
his
need
of
a
bonaparte
cracked
some
more
almonds
then
said
yawning
and
more
as
though
he
asked
for
the
sake
of
having
something
to
converse
about
than
from
any
interest
he
felt
in
the
subject
and
what
has
become
of
the
herd
s
wife
the
german
was
alight
again
in
a
moment
yes
his
wife
she
has
a
child
six
days
old
and
tant
sannie
would
turn
her
out
into
the
fields
this
night
that
said
the
german
rising
that
is
what
i
call
cruelty
diabolical
cruelty
my
soul
abhors
that
deed
the
man
that
could
do
such
a
thing
i
could
run
him
through
with
a
knife
said
the
german
his
grey
eyes
flashing
and
his
bushy
black
beard
adding
to
the
murderous
fury
of
his
aspect
then
suddenly
subsiding
he
said
but
all
is
now
well
tant
sannie
gives
her
word
that
the
maid
shall
remain
for
some
days
i
go
to
oom
muller
s
tomorrow
to
learn
if
the
sheep
may
not
be
there
if
they
are
not
then
i
return
they
are
gone
that
is
all
i
make
it
tant
sannie
is
a
singular
woman
said
bonaparte
taking
the
tobacco
bag
the
german
passed
to
him
singular
yes
said
the
german
but
her
heart
is
on
her
right
side
i
have
lived
long
years
with
her
and
i
may
say
i
have
for
her
an
affection
which
she
returns
i
may
say
added
the
german
with
warmth
i
may
say
that
there
is
not
one
soul
on
this
farm
for
whom
i
have
not
an
ah
my
friend
said
bonaparte
when
the
grace
of
god
is
in
our
hearts
is
it
not
with
us
all
do
we
not
love
the
very
worm
we
tread
upon
and
as
we
tread
upon
it
do
we
know
distinctions
of
race
or
of
sex
or
of
colour
no
love
so
amazing
so
divine
it
fills
my
soul
my
life
my
after
a
time
he
sank
into
a
less
fervent
mood
and
remarked
the
coloured
female
who
waits
upon
tant
sannie
appears
to
be
of
a
virtuous
disposition
an
individual
who
virtuous
said
the
german
i
have
confidence
in
her
there
is
that
in
her
which
is
pure
that
which
is
noble
the
rich
and
high
that
walk
this
earth
with
lofty
eyelids
might
exchange
with
the
german
here
got
up
to
bring
a
coal
for
bonaparte
s
pipe
and
they
sat
together
talking
for
a
while
at
length
bonaparte
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
it
is
time
that
i
took
my
departure
dear
friend
he
said
but
before
i
do
so
shall
we
not
close
this
evening
of
sweet
communion
and
brotherly
intercourse
by
a
few
words
of
prayer
oh
how
good
and
how
pleasant
a
thing
it
is
for
brethren
to
dwell
together
in
unity
it
is
like
the
dew
upon
the
mountains
of
hermon
for
there
the
lord
bestowed
a
blessing
even
life
for
stay
and
drink
some
coffee
said
the
german
no
thank
you
my
friend
i
have
business
that
must
be
done
tonight
said
bonaparte
your
dear
son
appears
to
have
gone
to
sleep
he
is
going
to
take
the
wagon
to
the
mill
tomorrow
what
a
little
man
he
a
fine
but
though
the
boy
nodded
before
the
fire
he
was
not
asleep
and
they
all
knelt
down
to
pray
when
they
rose
from
their
knees
bonaparte
extended
his
hand
to
waldo
and
patted
him
on
the
head
good
night
my
lad
said
he
as
you
go
to
the
mill
tomorrow
we
shall
not
see
you
for
some
days
good
night
the
lord
bless
and
guide
you
and
may
he
bring
you
back
to
us
in
safety
and
find
us
all
as
you
have
left
us
he
laid
some
emphasis
on
the
last
words
and
you
my
dear
friend
he
added
turning
with
redoubled
warmth
to
the
german
long
long
shall
i
look
back
to
this
evening
as
a
time
of
refreshing
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
as
an
hour
of
blessed
intercourse
with
a
brother
in
jesus
may
such
often
return
the
lord
bless
you
he
added
with
yet
deeper
fervour
richly
then
he
opened
the
door
and
vanished
out
into
the
darkness
he
he
he
laughed
bonaparte
as
he
stumbled
over
the
stones
if
there
isn
t
the
rarest
lot
of
fools
on
this
farm
that
ever
god
almighty
stuck
legs
to
he
he
he
when
the
worms
come
out
then
the
blackbirds
feed
ha
ha
ha
then
he
drew
himself
up
even
when
alone
he
liked
to
pose
with
a
certain
dignity
it
was
second
nature
to
him
he
looked
in
at
the
kitchen
door
the
hottentot
maid
who
acted
as
interpreter
between
tant
sannie
and
himself
was
gone
and
tant
sannie
herself
was
in
bed
never
mind
bon
my
boy
he
said
as
he
walked
round
to
his
own
room
tomorrow
will
do
he
he
he
chapter
he
catches
the
old
bird
at
four
o
clock
the
next
afternoon
the
german
rode
across
the
plain
returning
from
his
search
for
the
lost
sheep
he
rode
slowly
for
he
had
been
in
the
saddle
since
sunrise
and
was
somewhat
weary
and
the
heat
of
the
afternoon
made
his
horse
sleepy
as
it
picked
its
way
slowly
along
the
sandy
road
every
now
and
then
a
great
red
spider
would
start
out
of
the
karoo
on
one
side
of
the
path
and
run
across
to
the
other
but
nothing
else
broke
the
still
monotony
presently
behind
one
of
the
highest
of
the
that
dotted
the
roadside
the
german
caught
sight
of
a
kaffer
woman
seated
there
evidently
for
such
shadow
as
the
might
afford
from
the
sloping
rays
of
the
sun
the
german
turned
the
horse
s
head
out
of
the
road
it
was
not
his
way
to
pass
a
living
creature
without
a
word
of
greeting
coming
nearer
he
found
it
was
no
other
than
the
wife
of
the
absconding
kaffer
herd
she
had
a
baby
tied
on
her
back
by
a
dirty
strip
of
red
blanket
another
strip
hardly
larger
was
twisted
round
her
waist
for
the
rest
her
black
body
was
naked
she
was
a
sullen
woman
with
lips
hideously
protruding
the
german
questioned
her
as
to
how
she
came
there
she
muttered
in
broken
dutch
that
she
had
been
turned
away
had
she
done
evil
she
shook
her
head
sullenly
had
she
had
food
given
her
she
grunted
a
negative
and
fanned
the
flies
from
her
baby
telling
the
woman
to
remain
where
she
was
he
turned
his
horse
s
head
to
the
road
and
rode
off
at
a
furious
pace
cruel
oh
my
god
is
this
the
way
is
this
charity
yes
yes
yes
ejaculated
the
old
man
as
he
rode
on
but
presently
his
anger
began
to
evaporate
his
horse
s
pace
slackened
and
by
the
time
he
had
reached
his
own
door
he
was
nodding
and
smiling
dismounting
quickly
he
went
to
the
great
chest
where
his
provisions
were
kept
here
he
got
out
a
little
meal
a
little
mealies
a
few
these
he
tied
up
in
three
blue
handkerchiefs
and
putting
them
into
a
sailcloth
bag
he
strung
them
over
his
shoulders
then
he
looked
circumspectly
out
at
the
door
it
was
very
bad
to
be
discovered
in
the
act
of
giving
it
made
him
red
up
to
the
roots
of
his
old
grizzled
hair
no
one
was
about
however
so
he
rode
off
again
beside
the
sat
the
kaffer
woman
still
like
hagar
he
thought
thrust
out
by
her
mistress
in
the
wilderness
to
die
telling
her
to
loosen
the
handkerchief
from
her
head
he
poured
into
it
the
contents
of
his
bag
the
woman
tied
it
up
in
sullen
silence
you
must
try
and
get
to
the
next
farm
said
the
german
the
woman
shook
her
head
she
would
sleep
in
the
field
the
german
reflected
kaffer
women
were
accustomed
to
sleep
in
the
open
air
but
then
the
child
was
small
and
after
so
hot
a
day
the
night
might
be
chilly
that
she
would
creep
back
to
the
huts
at
the
homestead
when
the
darkness
favoured
her
the
german
s
sagacity
did
not
make
evident
to
him
he
took
off
the
old
brown
coat
and
held
it
out
to
her
the
woman
received
it
in
silence
and
laid
it
across
her
knee
with
that
they
will
sleep
warmly
not
so
bad
ha
ha
said
the
german
and
he
rode
home
nodding
his
head
in
a
manner
that
would
have
made
any
other
man
dizzy
i
wish
he
would
not
come
back
tonight
said
em
her
face
wet
with
tears
it
will
be
just
the
same
if
he
comes
back
tomorrow
said
lyndall
the
two
girls
sat
on
the
step
of
the
cabin
weeping
for
the
german
s
return
lyndall
shaded
her
eyes
with
her
hand
from
the
sunset
light
there
he
comes
she
said
whistling
ach
jerusalem
du
schone
so
loud
i
can
hear
him
from
perhaps
he
has
found
the
found
them
said
lyndall
he
would
whistle
just
so
if
he
knew
he
had
to
die
you
look
at
the
sunset
eh
chickens
the
german
said
as
he
came
up
at
a
smart
canter
ah
yes
that
is
beautiful
he
added
as
he
dismounted
pausing
for
a
moment
with
his
hand
on
the
saddle
to
look
at
the
evening
sky
where
the
sun
shot
up
long
flaming
streaks
between
which
and
the
eye
thin
yellow
clouds
floated
ei
you
weep
said
the
german
as
the
girls
ran
up
to
him
before
they
had
time
to
reply
the
voice
of
tant
sannie
was
heard
you
child
of
the
child
of
the
child
of
a
kaffer
s
dog
come
here
the
german
looked
up
he
thought
the
dutchwoman
come
out
to
cool
herself
in
the
yard
called
to
some
misbehaving
servant
the
old
man
looked
round
to
see
who
it
might
be
you
old
vagabond
of
a
praying
german
are
you
deaf
tant
sannie
stood
before
the
steps
of
the
kitchen
upon
them
sat
the
lean
hottentot
upon
the
highest
stood
bonaparte
blenkins
both
hands
folded
under
the
tails
of
his
coat
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
sunset
sky
the
german
dropped
the
saddle
on
the
ground
bish
bish
bish
what
may
this
be
he
said
and
walked
toward
the
house
very
strange
the
girls
followed
him
em
still
weeping
lyndall
with
her
face
rather
white
and
her
eyes
wide
open
and
i
have
the
heart
of
a
devil
did
you
say
you
could
run
me
through
with
a
knife
could
you
cried
the
dutchwoman
i
could
not
drive
the
kaffer
maid
away
because
i
was
afraid
of
you
was
i
oh

she
gasped
my
kaffers
will

you
through
the
sand
they
would
do
it
gladly
any
of
them
for
a
bit
of
tobacco
for
all
your
prayings
with
i
am
bewildered

bewildered
said
the
german
standing
before
her
and
raising
his
hand
to
his
forehead
i
i
do
not
ask
him
ask
him
cried
tant
sannie
pointing
to
bonaparte
he
knows
you
thought
he
could
not
make
me
understand
but
he
did
he
did
you
old
fool
i
know
enough
english
for
that

here
shouted
the
dutchwoman
when
the
morning
star
rises
and
i
will
let
my
kaffers
take
you
out
and
drag
you
till
there
is
not
one
bone
left
in
your
old
body
that
is
not
broken
as
fine
as
you
old
beggar
all
your
rags
are
not
worth
that
they
should
be
thrown
out
onto
the
cried
the
but
i
will
have
them
for
my
sheep
not
one
rotten
hoof
of
your
old
mare

you
i
will
have
her
all

for
my
sheep
that
you
have
lost
you
godless
thing
the
wiped
the
moisture
from
her
mouth
with
the
palm
of
her
hand
the
german
turned
to
bonaparte
who
still
stood
on
the
step
absorbed
in
the
beauty
of
the
sunset
do
not
address
me
do
not
approach
me
lost
man
said
bonaparte
not
moving
his
eye
nor
lowering
his
chin
there
is
a
crime
from
which
all
nature
revolts
there
is
a
crime
whose
name
is
loathsome
to
the
human
ear
that
crime
is
yours
that
crime
is
ingratitude
this
woman
has
been
your
benefactress
on
her
farm
you
have
lived
after
her
sheep
you
have
looked
into
her
house
you
have
been
allowed
to
enter
and
hold
divine
service
an
honour
of
which
you
were
never
worthy
and
how
have
you
rewarded
her
basely
basely
basely
but
it
is
all
false
lies
and
falsehoods
i
must
i
will
speak
said
the
german
suddenly
looking
round
bewildered
do
i
dream
are
you
mad
what
may
it
be
go
dog
cried
the
dutchwoman
i
would
have
been
a
rich
woman
this
day
if
it
had
not
been
for
your
laziness
praying
with
the
kaffers
behind
the
kraal
walls
go
you
kaffer
s
dog
but
what
then
is
the
matter
what
may
have
happened
since
i
left
said
the
german
turning
to
the
hottentot
woman
who
sat
upon
the
step
she
was
his
friend
she
would
tell
him
kindly
the
truth
the
woman
answered
by
a
loud
ringing
laugh
give
it
him
old
missis
give
it
him
it
was
so
nice
to
see
the
white
man
who
had
been
master
hunted
down
the
coloured
woman
laughed
and
threw
a
dozen
mealie
grains
into
her
mouth
to
chew
all
anger
and
excitement
faded
from
the
old
man
s
face
he
turned
slowly
away
and
walked
down
the
little
path
to
his
cabin
with
his
shoulders
bent
it
was
all
dark
before
him
he
stumbled
over
the
threshold
of
his
own
door
em
sobbing
bitterly
would
have
followed
him
but
the
prevented
her
by
a
flood
of
speech
which
convulsed
the
hottentot
so
low
were
its
images
come
em
said
lyndall
lifting
her
small
proud
head
let
us
go
in
we
will
not
stay
to
hear
such
she
looked
into
the
s
eyes
tant
sannie
understood
the
meaning
of
the
look
if
not
the
words
she
waddled
after
them
and
caught
em
by
the
arm
she
had
struck
lyndall
once
years
before
and
had
never
done
it
again
so
she
took
em
so
you
will
defy
me
too
will
you
you
englishman
s
ugliness
she
cried
and
with
one
hand
she
forced
the
child
down
and
held
her
head
tightly
against
her
knee
with
the
other
she
beat
her
first
upon
one
cheek
and
then
upon
the
other
for
one
instant
lyndall
looked
on
then
she
laid
her
small
fingers
on
the
s
arm
with
the
exertion
of
half
its
strength
tant
sannie
might
have
flung
the
girl
back
upon
the
stones
it
was
not
the
power
of
the
slight
fingers
tightly
though
they
clinched
her
broad
wrist
so
tightly
that
at
bedtime
the
marks
were
still
there
but
the
looked
into
the
clear
eyes
and
at
the
quivering
white
lips
and
with
a
curse
relaxed
her
hold
the
girl
drew
em
s
arm
through
her
own
move
she
said
to
bonaparte
who
stood
in
the
door
and
he
bonaparte
the
invincible
in
the
hour
of
his
triumph
moved
to
give
her
place
the
hottentot
ceased
to
laugh
and
an
uncomfortable
silence
fell
on
all
the
three
in
the
doorway
once
in
their
room
em
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
wailed
bitterly
lyndall
lay
on
the
bed
with
her
arm
drawn
across
her
eyes
very
white
and
still
hoo
hoo
cried
em
and
they
won
t
let
him
take
the
grey
mare
and
waldo
has
gone
to
the
mill
hoo
hoo
and
perhaps
they
won
t
let
us
go
and
say
to
him
hoo
hoo
hoo
i
wish
you
would
be
quiet
said
lyndall
without
moving
does
it
give
you
such
felicity
to
let
bonaparte
know
he
is
hurting
you
we
will
ask
no
one
it
will
be
suppertime
soon
listen
and
when
you
hear
the
clink
of
the
knives
and
forks
we
will
go
out
and
see
em
suppressed
her
sobs
and
listened
intently
kneeling
at
the
door
suddenly
some
one
came
to
the
window
and
put
the
shutter
up
who
was
that
said
lyndall
starting
the
girl
i
suppose
said
em
how
early
she
is
this
evening
but
lyndall
sprang
from
the
bed
and
seized
the
handle
of
the
door
shaking
it
fiercely
the
door
was
locked
on
the
outside
she
ground
her
teeth
what
is
the
matter
asked
em
the
room
was
in
perfect
darkness
now
nothing
said
lyndall
quietly
only
they
have
locked
us
she
turned
and
went
back
to
bed
again
but
ere
long
em
heard
a
sound
of
movement
lyndall
had
climbed
up
into
the
window
and
with
her
fingers
felt
the
woodwork
that
surrounded
the
panes
slipping
down
the
girl
loosened
the
iron
knob
from
the
foot
of
the
bedstead
and
climbing
up
again
she
broke
with
it
every
pane
of
glass
in
the
window
beginning
at
the
top
and
ending
at
the
bottom
what
are
you
doing
asked
em
who
heard
the
falling
fragments
her
companion
made
her
no
reply
but
leaned
on
every
little
which
cracked
and
gave
way
beneath
her
then
she
pressed
with
all
her
strength
against
the
shutter
she
had
thought
the
wooden
buttons
would
give
way
but
by
the
clinking
sound
she
knew
that
the
iron
bar
had
been
put
across
she
was
quite
quiet
for
a
time
clambering
down
she
took
from
the
table
a
small
penknife
with
which
she
began
to
peck
at
the
hard
wood
of
the
shutter
what
are
you
doing
now
asked
em
who
had
ceased
crying
in
her
wonder
and
had
drawn
near
trying
to
make
a
hole
was
the
short
reply
do
you
think
you
will
be
able
to
no
but
i
am
in
an
agony
of
suspense
em
waited
for
ten
minutes
lyndall
pecked
the
hole
was
of
an
inch
deep
then
the
blade
sprung
into
ten
pieces
what
has
happened
now
em
asked
blubbering
afresh
nothing
said
lyndall
bring
me
my
nightgown
a
piece
of
paper
and
the
wondering
em
fumbled
about
till
she
found
them
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
them
she
whispered
burn
down
the
but
won
t
the
whole
house
take
fire
and
burn
down
too
but
will
it
not
be
very
wicked
yes
very
and
i
do
not
she
arranged
the
nightgown
carefully
in
the
corner
of
the
window
with
the
chips
of
the
frame
about
it
there
was
only
one
match
in
the
box
she
drew
it
carefully
along
the
wall
for
a
moment
it
burnt
up
blue
and
showed
the
tiny
face
with
its
glistening
eyes
she
held
it
carefully
to
the
paper
for
an
instant
it
burnt
up
brightly
then
flickered
and
went
out
she
blew
the
spark
but
it
died
also
then
she
threw
the
paper
on
to
the
ground
trod
on
it
and
went
to
her
bed
and
began
to
undress
em
rushed
to
the
door
knocking
against
it
wildly
oh
tant
sannie
tant
sannie
oh
let
us
out
she
cried
oh
lyndall
what
are
we
to
do
lyndall
wiped
a
drop
of
blood
off
the
lip
she
had
bitten
i
am
going
to
sleep
she
said
if
you
like
to
sit
there
and
howl
till
the
morning
do
perhaps
you
will
find
that
it
helps
i
never
heard
that
howling
helped
any
long
after
when
em
herself
had
gone
to
bed
and
was
almost
asleep
lyndall
came
and
stood
at
her
bedside
here
she
said
slipping
a
little
pot
of
powder
into
her
hand
rub
some
on
to
your
face
does
it
not
burn
where
she
struck
you
then
she
crept
back
to
her
own
bed
long
long
after
when
em
was
really
asleep
she
lay
still
awake
and
folded
her
hands
on
her
little
breast
and
muttered
when
that
day
comes
and
i
am
strong
i
will
hate
everything
that
has
power
and
help
everything
that
is
and
she
bit
her
lip
again
the
german
looked
out
at
the
cabin
door
for
the
last
time
that
night
then
he
paced
the
room
slowly
and
sighed
then
he
drew
out
pen
and
paper
and
sat
down
to
write
rubbing
his
old
grey
eyes
with
his
knuckles
before
he
began
my
chickens
you
did
not
come
to
say
to
the
old
man
might
you
ah
well
there
is
a
land
where
they
part
no
more
where
saints
immortal
reign
i
sit
here
alone
and
i
think
of
you
will
you
forget
the
old
man
when
you
wake
tomorrow
he
will
be
far
away
the
old
horse
is
lazy
but
he
has
his
stick
to
help
him
that
is
three
legs
he
comes
back
one
day
with
gold
and
diamonds
will
you
welcome
him
well
we
shall
see
i
go
to
meet
waldo
he
comes
back
with
the
wagon
then
he
follows
me
poor
boy
god
knows
there
is
a
land
where
all
things
are
made
right
but
that
land
is
not
here
my
little
children
serve
the
saviour
give
your
hearts
to
him
while
you
are
yet
young
life
is
short
nothing
is
mine
otherwise
i
would
say
lyndall
take
my
books
em
my
stones
now
i
say
nothing
the
things
are
mine
it
is
not
righteous
god
knows
but
i
am
silent
let
it
be
but
i
feel
it
i
must
say
i
feel
it
do
not
cry
too
much
for
the
old
man
he
goes
out
to
seek
his
fortune
and
comes
back
with
it
in
a
bag
it
may
be
i
love
my
children
do
they
think
of
me
i
am
old
otto
who
goes
out
to
seek
his
fortune
having
concluded
this
quaint
production
he
put
it
where
the
children
would
find
it
the
next
morning
and
proceeded
to
prepare
his
bundle
he
never
thought
of
entering
a
protest
against
the
loss
of
his
goods
like
a
child
he
submitted
and
wept
he
had
been
there
eleven
years
and
it
was
hard
to
go
away
he
spread
open
on
the
bed
a
blue
handkerchief
and
on
it
put
one
by
one
the
things
he
thought
most
necessary
and
important
a
little
bag
of
curious
seeds
which
he
meant
to
plant
some
day
an
old
german
three
misshapen
stones
that
he
greatly
valued
a
bible
a
shirt
and
two
handkerchiefs
then
there
was
room
for
nothing
more
he
tied
up
the
bundle
tightly
and
put
it
on
a
chair
by
his
bedside
that
is
not
much
they
can
not
say
i
take
much
he
said
looking
at
it
he
put
his
knotted
stick
beside
it
his
blue
tobacco
bag
and
his
short
pipe
and
then
inspected
his
coats
he
had
two
left
a
overcoat
and
a
black
alpaca
out
at
the
elbows
he
decided
for
the
overcoat
it
was
warm
certainly
but
then
he
could
carry
it
over
his
arm
and
only
put
it
on
when
he
met
some
one
along
the
road
it
was
more
respectable
than
the
black
alpaca
he
hung
the
greatcoat
over
the
back
of
the
chair
and
stuffed
a
hard
bit
of
under
the
knot
of
the
bundle
and
then
his
preparations
were
completed
the
german
stood
contemplating
them
with
much
satisfaction
he
had
almost
forgotten
his
sorrow
at
leaving
in
his
pleasure
at
preparing
suddenly
he
started
an
expression
of
intense
pain
passed
over
his
face
he
drew
back
his
left
arm
quickly
and
then
pressed
his
right
hand
upon
his
breast
ah
the
sudden
pang
again
he
said
his
face
was
white
but
it
quickly
regained
its
colour
then
the
old
man
busied
himself
in
putting
everything
right
i
will
leave
it
neat
they
shall
not
say
i
did
not
leave
it
neat
he
said
even
the
little
bags
of
seeds
on
the
mantelpiece
he
put
in
rows
and
dusted
then
he
undressed
and
got
into
bed
under
his
pillow
was
a
little
storybook
he
drew
it
forth
to
the
old
german
a
story
was
no
story
its
events
were
as
real
and
as
important
to
himself
as
the
matters
of
his
own
life
he
could
not
go
away
without
knowing
whether
that
wicked
earl
relented
and
whether
the
baron
married
emilina
so
he
adjusted
his
spectacles
and
began
to
read
occasionally
as
his
feelings
became
too
strongly
moved
he
ejaculated
ah
i
thought
so
that
was
a
rogue
i
saw
it
before
i
knew
it
from
the
beginning
more
than
half
an
hour
had
passed
when
he
looked
up
to
the
silver
watch
at
the
top
of
his
bed
the
march
is
long
tomorrow
this
will
not
do
he
said
taking
off
his
spectacles
and
putting
them
carefully
into
the
book
to
mark
the
place
this
will
be
good
reading
as
i
walk
along
tomorrow
he
added
as
he
stuffed
the
book
into
the
pocket
of
the
greatcoat
very
good
he
nodded
his
head
and
lay
down
he
thought
a
little
of
his
own
troubles
a
good
deal
of
the
two
little
girls
he
was
leaving
of
the
earl
of
emilina
of
the
baron
but
he
was
soon
asleep
sleeping
as
peacefully
as
a
little
child
upon
whose
innocent
soul
sorrow
and
care
can
not
rest
it
was
very
quiet
in
the
room
the
coals
in
the
fireplace
threw
a
dull
red
light
across
the
floor
upon
the
red
lions
on
the
quilt
eleven
o
clock
came
and
the
room
was
very
still
one
o
clock
came
the
glimmer
had
died
out
though
the
ashes
were
still
warm
and
the
room
was
very
dark
the
grey
mouse
who
had
his
hole
under
the
toolbox
came
out
and
sat
on
the
sacks
in
the
corner
then
growing
bolder
the
room
was
so
dark
it
climbed
the
chair
at
the
bedside
nibbled
at
the
took
one
bite
quickly
at
the
candle
and
then
sat
on
his
haunches
listening
it
heard
the
even
breathing
of
the
old
man
and
the
steps
of
the
hungry
kaffer
dog
going
his
last
round
in
search
of
a
bone
or
a
skin
that
had
been
forgotten
and
it
heard
the
white
hen
call
out
as
the
wild
cat
ran
away
with
one
of
her
brood
and
it
heard
the
chicken
cry
then
the
grey
mouse
went
back
to
its
hole
under
the
toolbox
and
the
room
was
quiet
and
two
o
clock
came
by
that
time
the
night
was
grown
dull
and
cloudy
the
wild
cat
had
gone
to
its
home
on
the
kopje
the
kaffer
dog
had
found
a
bone
and
lay
gnawing
it
an
intense
quiet
reigned
everywhere
only
in
her
room
the
tossed
her
great
arms
in
her
sleep
for
she
dreamed
that
a
dark
shadow
with
outstretched
wings
fled
slowly
over
her
house
and
she
moaned
and
shivered
and
the
night
was
very
still
but
quiet
as
all
places
were
there
was
a
quite
peculiar
quiet
in
the
german
s
room
though
you
strained
your
ear
most
carefully
you
caught
no
sound
of
breathing
he
was
not
gone
for
the
old
coat
still
hung
on
the
chair
the
coat
that
was
to
be
put
on
when
he
met
any
one
and
the
bundle
and
stick
were
ready
for
tomorrow
s
long
march
the
old
german
himself
lay
there
his
wavy
black
hair
just
touched
with
grey
thrown
back
upon
the
pillow
the
old
face
was
lying
there
alone
in
the
dark
smiling
like
a
little
child
s
oh
so
peacefully
there
is
a
stranger
whose
coming
they
say
is
worse
than
all
the
ills
of
life
from
whose
presence
we
flee
away
trembling
but
he
comes
very
tenderly
sometimes
and
it
seemed
almost
as
though
death
had
known
and
loved
the
old
man
so
gently
it
touched
him
and
how
could
it
deal
hardly
with
him
the
loving
simple
childlike
old
man
so
it
smoothed
out
the
wrinkles
that
were
in
the
old
forehead
and
fixed
the
passing
smile
and
sealed
the
eyes
that
they
might
not
weep
again
and
then
the
short
sleep
of
time
was
melted
into
the
long
long
sleep
of
eternity
how
has
he
grown
so
young
in
this
one
night
they
said
when
they
found
him
in
the
morning
yes
dear
old
man
to
such
as
you
time
brings
no
age
you
die
with
the
purity
and
innocence
of
your
childhood
upon
you
though
you
die
in
your
grey
hairs
chapter
he
sees
a
ghost
bonaparte
stood
on
the
he
espied
across
the
plain
a
moving
speck
and
he
chucked
his
up
and
down
in
expectancy
of
a
scene
the
wagon
came
on
slowly
waldo
laid
curled
among
the
sacks
at
the
back
of
the
wagon
the
hand
in
his
breast
resting
on
the
machine
it
was
finished
now
the
right
thought
had
struck
him
the
day
before
as
he
sat
half
asleep
watching
the
water
go
over
the
he
muttered
to
himself
with
eyes
tomorrow
smooth
the
cogs
tighten
the
screws
a
little
show
it
to
then
after
a
pause
over
the
whole
world
the
whole
world
mine
that
i
have
made
he
pressed
the
little
wheels
and
pulleys
in
his
pocket
till
they
cracked
presently
his
muttering
became
louder
and
fifty
pounds
a
black
hat
for
my
dadda
for
lyndall
a
blue
silk
very
light
and
one
purple
like
the
and
white
he
muttered
on
a
box
full
full
of
books
they
shall
tell
me
all
all
all
he
added
moving
his
fingers
desiringly
why
the
crystals
grow
in
such
beautiful
shapes
why
lightning
runs
to
the
iron
why
black
people
are
black
why
the
sunlight
makes
things
warm
i
shall
read
read
read
he
muttered
slowly
then
came
over
him
suddenly
what
he
called
the
presence
of
god
a
sense
of
a
good
strong
something
folding
him
round
he
smiled
through
his
eyes
ah
father
my
own
father
it
is
so
sweet
to
feel
you
like
the
warm
sunshine
the
bibles
and
books
can
not
tell
of
you
and
all
i
feel
you
they
are
mixed
with
men
s
words
but
you
his
muttering
sank
into
inaudible
confusion
till
opening
his
eyes
wide
it
struck
him
that
the
brown
plain
he
looked
at
was
the
old
home
farm
for
half
an
hour
they
had
been
riding
in
it
and
he
had
not
known
it
he
roused
the
leader
who
sat
nodding
on
the
front
of
the
wagon
in
the
early
morning
sunlight
they
were
within
half
a
mile
of
the
homestead
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
gone
from
them
all
a
year
he
fancied
he
could
see
lyndall
standing
on
the
brick
wall
to
watch
for
him
his
father
passing
from
one
house
to
the
other
stopping
to
look
he
called
aloud
to
the
oxen
for
each
one
at
home
he
had
brought
something
for
his
father
a
piece
of
tobacco
bought
at
the
shop
by
the
mill
for
em
a
thimble
for
lyndall
a
beautiful
flower
dug
out
by
the
roots
at
a
place
where
they
had
outspanned
for
tant
sannie
a
handkerchief
when
they
drew
near
the
house
he
threw
the
whip
to
the
kaffer
leader
and
sprung
from
the
side
of
the
wagon
to
run
on
bonaparte
stopped
him
as
he
ran
past
the
good
morning
my
dear
boy
where
are
you
running
to
so
fast
with
your
rosy
cheeks
the
boy
looked
up
at
him
glad
even
to
see
bonaparte
i
am
going
to
the
cabin
he
said
out
of
breath
you
won
t
find
them
in
just
now
not
your
good
old
father
said
bonaparte
where
is
he
asked
the
lad
there
beyond
the
camps
said
bonaparte
waving
his
hand
oratorically
toward
the
what
is
he
doing
there
asked
the
boy
bonaparte
patted
him
on
the
cheek
kindly
we
could
not
keep
him
any
more
it
was
too
hot
we
ve
buried
him
my
boy
said
bonaparte
touching
with
his
finger
the
boy
s
cheek
we
couldn
t
keep
him
any
more
he
he
he
laughed
bonaparte
as
the
boy
fled
away
along
the
low
stone
wall
almost
furtively
as
one
in
fear
at
five
o
clock
bonaparte
knelt
before
a
box
in
the
german
s
room
he
was
busily
unpacking
it
it
had
been
agreed
upon
between
tant
sannie
and
himself
that
now
the
german
was
gone
he
bonaparte
was
to
be
no
longer
schoolmaster
but
overseer
of
the
farm
in
return
for
his
past
scholastic
labours
he
had
expressed
himself
willing
to
take
possession
of
the
dead
man
s
goods
and
room
tant
sannie
hardly
liked
the
arrangement
she
had
a
great
deal
more
respect
for
the
german
dead
than
the
german
living
and
would
rather
his
goods
had
been
allowed
to
descend
peacefully
to
his
son
for
she
was
a
firm
believer
in
the
chinks
in
the
world
above
where
not
only
ears
but
eyes
might
be
applied
to
see
how
things
went
on
in
this
world
below
she
never
felt
sure
how
far
the
might
overlap
this
world
of
sense
and
as
a
rule
prudently
abstained
from
doing
anything
which
might
offend
unseen
auditors
for
this
reason
she
abstained
from
the
dead
englishman
s
daughter
and
niece
and
for
this
reason
she
would
rather
the
boy
had
had
his
father
s
goods
but
it
was
hard
to
refuse
bonaparte
anything
when
she
and
he
sat
so
happily
together
in
the
evening
drinking
coffee
bonaparte
telling
her
in
the
broken
dutch
he
was
fast
learning
how
he
adored
fat
women
and
what
a
splendid
farmer
he
was
so
at
five
o
clock
on
this
afternoon
bonaparte
knelt
in
the
german
s
room
somewhere
here
it
is
he
said
as
he
packed
the
old
clothes
carefully
out
of
the
box
and
finding
nothing
packed
them
in
again
somewhere
in
this
room
it
is
and
if
it
s
here
bonaparte
finds
it
he
repeated
you
didn
t
stay
here
all
these
years
without
making
a
little
pile
somewhere
my
lamb
you
weren
t
such
a
fool
as
you
looked
oh
no
said
bonaparte
he
now
walked
about
the
room
diving
his
fingers
in
everywhere
sticking
them
into
the
great
crevices
in
the
wall
and
frightening
out
the
spiders
rapping
them
against
the
old
plaster
till
it
cracked
and
fell
in
pieces
peering
up
the
chimney
till
the
soot
dropped
on
his
bald
head
and
blackened
it
he
felt
in
little
blue
bags
he
tried
to
raise
the
he
shook
each
book
till
the
old
leaves
fell
down
in
showers
on
the
floor
it
was
getting
dark
and
bonaparte
stood
with
his
finger
on
his
nose
reflecting
finally
he
walked
to
the
door
behind
which
hung
the
trousers
and
waistcoat
the
dead
man
had
last
worn
he
had
felt
in
them
but
hurriedly
just
after
the
funeral
the
day
before
he
would
examine
them
again
sticking
his
fingers
into
the
waistcoat
pockets
he
found
in
one
corner
a
hole
pressing
his
hand
through
it
between
the
lining
and
the
cloth
he
presently
came
into
contact
with
something
bonaparte
drew
it
forth
a
small
square
parcel
sewed
up
in
he
gazed
at
it
squeezed
it
it
cracked
as
though
full
of
he
put
it
quickly
into
his
own
waistcoat
pocket
and
peeped
over
the
to
see
if
there
was
any
one
coming
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
the
last
rays
of
yellow
sunset
light
painting
the
karoo
bushes
in
the
plain
and
shining
on
the
where
the
fowls
were
pecking
he
turned
and
sat
down
on
the
nearest
chair
and
taking
out
his
ripped
the
parcel
open
the
first
thing
that
fell
was
a
shower
of
yellow
faded
papers
bonaparte
opened
them
carefully
one
by
one
and
smoothed
them
out
on
his
knee
there
was
something
very
valuable
to
be
hidden
so
carefully
though
the
german
characters
he
could
not
decipher
when
he
came
to
the
last
one
he
felt
there
was
something
hard
in
it
you
ve
got
it
bon
my
boy
you
ve
got
it
he
cried
slapping
his
leg
hard
edging
nearer
to
the
door
for
the
light
was
fading
he
opened
the
paper
carefully
there
was
nothing
inside
but
a
plain
gold
better
than
nothing
said
bonaparte
trying
to
put
it
on
his
little
finger
which
however
proved
too
fat
he
took
it
off
and
set
it
down
on
the
table
before
him
and
looked
at
it
with
his
crosswise
eyes
when
that
auspicious
hour
sannie
he
said
shall
have
arrived
when
panting
i
shall
lead
thee
lighted
by
hymen
s
torch
to
the
connubial
altar
then
upon
thy
fair
amaranthine
finger
my
joyous
bride
shall
this
ring
repose
thy
fair
body
oh
my
girl
shall
bonaparte
possess
his
fingers
in
thy
he
therein
too
shall
having
given
utterance
to
this
flood
of
poesy
he
sat
lost
in
joyous
reflection
he
therein
too
shall
mess
he
repeated
meditatively
at
this
instant
as
bonaparte
swore
and
swore
truly
to
the
end
of
his
life
a
slow
and
distinct
rap
was
given
on
the
crown
of
his
bald
head
bonaparte
started
and
looked
up
no
riem
or
strap
hung
down
from
the
rafters
above
and
not
a
human
creature
was
near
the
door
it
was
growing
dark
he
did
not
like
it
he
began
to
fold
up
the
papers
expeditiously
he
stretched
out
his
hand
for
the
ring
the
ring
was
gone
gone
although
no
human
creature
had
entered
the
room
gone
although
no
form
had
crossed
the
doorway
gone
he
would
not
sleep
there
that
was
certain
he
stuffed
the
papers
into
his
pocket
as
he
did
so
three
slow
and
distinct
taps
were
given
on
the
crown
of
his
head
bonaparte
s
jaw
fell
each
separate
joint
lost
its
power
he
could
not
move
he
dared
not
rise
his
tongue
lay
loose
in
his
mouth
take
all
take
all
he
gurgled
in
his
throat
i
i
do
not
want
them
take
here
a
resolute
tug
at
the
grey
curls
at
the
back
of
his
head
caused
him
to
leap
up
yelling
wildly
was
he
to
sit
still
paralyzed
to
be
dragged
away
bodily
to
the
devil
with
terrific
shrieks
he
fled
casting
no
glance
behind
when
the
dew
was
falling
and
the
evening
was
dark
a
small
figure
moved
toward
the
gate
of
the
furthest
driving
a
bird
before
it
when
the
gate
was
opened
and
the
bird
driven
in
and
the
gate
fastened
it
turned
away
but
then
suddenly
paused
near
the
stone
wall
is
that
you
waldo
said
lyndall
hearing
a
sound
the
boy
was
sitting
on
the
damp
ground
with
his
back
to
the
wall
he
gave
her
no
answer
come
she
said
bending
over
him
i
have
been
looking
for
you
all
he
mumbled
something
you
have
had
nothing
to
eat
i
have
put
some
supper
in
your
room
you
must
come
home
with
me
she
took
his
hand
and
the
boy
rose
slowly
she
made
him
take
her
arm
and
twisted
her
small
fingers
among
his
you
must
forget
she
whispered
since
it
happened
i
walk
i
talk
i
never
sit
still
if
we
remember
we
can
not
bring
back
the
she
knit
her
little
fingers
closer
among
his
forgetting
is
the
best
thing
he
did
watch
it
coming
she
whispered
presently
that
is
the
dreadful
thing
to
see
it
coming
she
shuddered
i
want
it
to
come
so
to
me
too
why
do
you
think
i
was
driving
that
bird
she
added
quickly
that
was
hans
the
bird
that
hates
bonaparte
i
let
him
out
this
afternoon
i
thought
he
would
chase
him
and
perhaps
kill
the
boy
showed
no
sign
of
interest
he
did
not
catch
him
but
he
put
his
head
over
the
of
your
cabin
and
frightened
him
horribly
he
was
there
busy
stealing
your
things
perhaps
he
will
leave
them
alone
now
but
i
wish
the
bird
had
trodden
on
they
said
no
more
till
they
reached
the
door
of
the
cabin
there
is
a
candle
and
supper
on
the
table
you
must
eat
she
said
authoritatively
i
can
not
stay
with
you
now
lest
they
find
out
about
the
he
grasped
her
arm
and
brought
his
mouth
close
to
her
ear
there
is
no
god
he
almost
hissed
no
god
not
anywhere
she
started
not
anywhere
he
ground
it
out
between
his
teeth
and
she
felt
his
hot
breath
on
her
cheek
waldo
you
are
mad
she
said
drawing
herself
from
him
instinctively
he
loosened
his
grasp
and
turned
away
from
her
also
in
truth
is
it
not
life
s
way
we
fight
our
little
battles
alone
you
yours
i
mine
we
must
not
help
or
find
help
when
your
life
is
most
real
to
me
you
are
mad
when
your
agony
is
blackest
i
look
at
you
and
wonder
friendship
is
good
a
strong
stick
but
when
the
hour
comes
to
lean
hard
it
gives
in
the
day
of
their
bitterest
need
all
souls
are
alone
lyndall
stood
by
him
in
the
dark
pityingly
wonderingly
as
he
walked
to
the
door
she
came
after
him
eat
your
supper
it
will
do
you
good
she
said
she
rubbed
her
cheek
against
his
shoulder
and
then
ran
away
in
the
front
room
the
little
woolly
kaffer
girl
was
washing
tant
sannie
s
feet
in
a
small
tub
and
bonaparte
who
sat
on
the
wooden
sofa
was
pulling
off
his
shoes
and
stockings
that
his
own
feet
might
be
washed
also
there
were
three
candles
burning
in
the
room
and
he
and
tant
sannie
sat
close
together
with
the
lean
hottentot
not
far
off
for
when
ghosts
are
about
much
light
is
needed
there
is
great
strength
in
numbers
bonaparte
had
completely
recovered
from
the
effects
of
his
fright
in
the
afternoon
and
the
numerous
doses
of
brandy
that
it
had
been
necessary
to
administer
to
him
to
effect
his
restoration
had
put
him
into
a
singularly
pleasant
and
amiable
mood
that
boy
waldo
said
bonaparte
rubbing
his
toes
took
himself
off
coolly
this
morning
as
soon
as
the
wagon
came
and
has
not
done
a
stiver
of
work
all
day
i
ll
not
have
that
kind
of
thing
now
i
m
master
of
this
the
hottentot
maid
translated
ah
i
expect
he
s
sorry
that
his
father
s
dead
said
tant
sannie
it
s
nature
you
know
i
cried
the
whole
morning
when
my
father
died
one
can
always
get
another
husband
but
one
can
t
get
another
father
said
tant
sannie
casting
a
sidelong
glance
at
bonaparte
bonaparte
expressed
a
wish
to
give
waldo
his
orders
for
the
next
day
s
work
and
accordingly
the
little
kaffer
was
sent
to
call
him
after
a
considerable
time
the
boy
appeared
and
stood
in
the
doorway
if
they
had
dressed
him
in
one
of
the
coats
and
oiled
his
hair
till
the
drops
fell
from
it
and
it
lay
as
smooth
as
an
elder
s
on
sacrament
sunday
there
would
still
have
been
something
unanointed
in
the
aspect
of
the
fellow
as
it
was
standing
there
in
his
strange
old
costume
his
head
presenting
much
the
appearance
of
having
been
deeply
rolled
in
sand
his
eyelids
swollen
the
hair
hanging
over
his
forehead
and
a
dogged
sullenness
on
his
features
he
presented
most
the
appearance
of
an
young
buffalo
beloved
lord
cried
tant
sannie
how
he
looks
come
in
boy
couldn
t
you
come
and
say
to
me
don
t
you
want
some
supper
he
said
he
wanted
nothing
and
turned
his
heavy
eyes
away
from
her
there
s
a
ghost
been
seen
in
your
father
s
room
said
tant
sannie
if
you
re
afraid
you
can
sleep
in
the
i
will
sleep
in
our
room
said
the
boy
slowly
well
you
can
go
now
she
said
but
be
up
early
to
take
the
sheep
the
herd
yes
be
up
early
my
boy
interrupted
bonaparte
smiling
i
am
to
be
master
of
this
farm
now
and
we
shall
be
good
friends
i
trust
very
good
friends
if
you
try
to
do
your
duty
my
dear
waldo
turned
to
go
and
bonaparte
looking
benignly
at
the
candle
stretched
out
one
unstockinged
foot
over
which
waldo
looking
at
nothing
in
particular
fell
with
a
heavy
thud
upon
the
floor
dear
me
i
hope
you
are
not
hurt
my
boy
said
bonaparte
you
ll
have
many
a
harder
thing
than
that
though
before
you
ve
gone
through
life
he
added
consolingly
as
waldo
picked
himself
up
the
lean
hottentot
laughed
till
the
room
rang
again
and
tant
sannie
tittered
till
her
sides
ached
when
he
had
gone
the
little
maid
began
to
wash
bonaparte
s
feet
oh
lord
beloved
lord
how
he
did
fall
i
can
t
think
of
it
cried
tant
sannie
and
she
laughed
again
i
always
did
know
he
was
not
right
but
this
evening
any
one
could
see
it
she
added
wiping
the
tears
of
mirth
from
her
face
his
eyes
are
as
wild
as
if
the
devil
was
in
them
he
never
was
like
other
children
the
dear
lord
knows
if
he
doesn
t
walk
alone
for
hours
talking
to
himself
if
you
sit
in
the
room
with
him
you
can
see
his
lips
moving
the
whole
time
and
if
you
talk
to
him
twenty
times
he
doesn
t
hear
you
he
s
as
mad
as
mad
can
this
repetition
of
the
word
mad
conveyed
meaning
to
bonaparte
s
mind
he
left
off
paddling
his
toes
in
the
water
mad
mad
i
know
that
kind
of
mad
said
bonaparte
and
i
know
the
thing
to
give
for
it
the
front
end
of
a
little
horsewhip
the
tip
nice
thing
takes
it
out
said
bonaparte
the
hottentot
laughed
and
translated
no
more
walking
about
and
talking
to
themselves
on
this
farm
now
said
bonaparte
no
more
minding
of
sheep
and
reading
of
books
at
the
same
time
the
point
of
a
horsewhip
is
a
little
thing
but
i
think
he
ll
have
a
taste
of
it
before
bonaparte
rubbed
his
hands
and
looked
pleasantly
across
his
nose
and
then
the
three
laughed
together
grimly
and
waldo
in
his
cabin
crouched
in
the
dark
in
a
corner
with
his
knees
drawn
up
to
his
chin
chapter
he
shows
his
teeth
doss
sat
among
the
karoo
bushes
one
yellow
ear
drawn
over
his
wicked
little
eye
ready
to
flap
away
any
adventurous
fly
that
might
settle
on
his
nose
around
him
in
the
morning
sunlight
fed
the
sheep
behind
him
lay
his
master
polishing
his
machine
he
found
much
comfort
in
handling
it
that
morning
a
dozen
philosophical
essays
or
angelically
atuned
songs
for
the
consolation
of
the
bereaved
could
never
have
been
to
him
what
that
little
machine
was
that
day
after
struggling
to
see
the
unseeable
growing
drunk
with
the
endeavour
to
span
the
infinite
and
writhing
before
the
inscrutable
mystery
it
is
a
renovating
relief
to
turn
to
some
simple
feelable
weighable
substance
to
something
which
has
a
smell
and
a
colour
which
may
be
handled
and
turned
over
this
way
and
that
whether
there
be
or
be
not
a
hereafter
whether
there
be
any
use
in
calling
aloud
to
the
unseen
power
whether
there
be
an
unseen
power
to
call
to
whatever
be
the
true
nature
of
the
i
who
call
and
of
the
objects
around
me
whatever
be
our
meaning
our
internal
essence
our
cause
and
in
a
certain
order
of
minds
death
and
the
agony
of
loss
inevitably
awaken
the
wild
desire
at
other
times
smothered
to
look
into
these
things
whatever
be
the
nature
of
that
which
lies
beyond
the
unbroken
wall
which
the
limits
of
the
human
intellect
build
up
on
every
hand
this
thing
is
certain
a
knife
will
cut
wood
and
one
cogged
wheel
will
turn
another
this
is
sure
waldo
found
an
immeasurable
satisfaction
in
the
handling
of
his
machine
but
doss
winked
and
blinked
and
thought
it
all
frightfully
monotonous
out
there
on
the
flat
and
presently
dropped
asleep
sitting
bolt
upright
suddenly
his
eyes
opened
wide
something
was
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
homestead
winking
his
eyes
and
looking
intently
he
perceived
it
was
the
grey
mare
now
doss
had
wondered
much
of
late
what
had
become
of
her
master
seeing
she
carried
some
one
on
her
back
he
now
came
to
his
own
conclusion
and
began
to
move
his
tail
violently
up
and
down
presently
he
pricked
up
one
ear
and
let
the
other
hang
his
tail
became
motionless
and
the
expression
of
his
mouth
was
one
of
decided
disapproval
bordering
on
scorn
he
wrinkled
his
lips
up
on
each
side
into
little
lines
the
sand
was
soft
and
the
grey
mare
came
on
so
noiselessly
that
the
boy
heard
nothing
till
bonaparte
dismounted
then
doss
got
up
and
moved
back
a
step
he
did
not
approve
of
bonaparte
s
appearance
his
costume
in
truth
was
of
a
unique
kind
it
was
a
combination
of
the
town
and
country
the
tails
of
his
black
cloth
coat
were
pinned
up
behind
to
keep
them
from
rubbing
he
had
on
a
pair
of
moleskin
trousers
and
leather
gaiters
and
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
little
whip
of
rhinoceros
hide
waldo
started
and
looked
up
had
there
been
a
moment
s
time
he
would
have
dug
a
hole
in
the
sand
with
his
hands
and
buried
his
treasure
it
was
only
a
toy
of
wood
but
he
loved
it
as
one
of
necessity
loves
what
has
been
born
of
him
whether
of
the
flesh
or
spirit
when
cold
eyes
have
looked
at
it
the
feathers
are
rubbed
off
our
butterfly
s
wing
forever
what
have
you
here
my
lad
said
bonaparte
standing
by
him
and
pointing
with
the
end
of
his
whip
to
the
medley
of
wheels
and
hinges
the
boy
muttered
something
inaudible
and
half
spread
over
the
thing
but
this
seems
to
be
a
very
ingenious
little
machine
said
bonaparte
seating
himself
on
the
antheap
and
bending
down
over
it
with
deep
interest
what
is
it
for
my
lad
shearing
it
is
a
very
nice
little
machine
said
bonaparte
how
does
it
work
now
i
have
never
seen
anything
so
ingenious
there
was
never
a
parent
who
heard
deception
in
the
voice
that
praised
his
child
his
here
was
one
who
liked
the
thing
that
had
been
created
in
him
he
forgot
everything
he
showed
how
the
shears
would
work
with
a
little
guidance
how
the
sheep
would
be
held
and
the
wool
fall
into
the
trough
a
flush
burst
over
his
face
as
he
spoke
i
tell
you
what
my
lad
said
bonaparte
emphatically
when
the
explanation
was
finished
we
must
get
you
a
patent
your
fortune
is
made
in
three
years
time
there
ll
not
be
a
farm
in
this
colony
where
it
isn
t
working
you
re
a
genius
that
s
what
you
are
said
bonaparte
rising
if
it
were
made
larger
said
the
boy
raising
his
eyes
it
would
work
more
smoothly
do
you
think
there
would
be
any
one
in
this
colony
would
be
able
to
make
it
i
m
sure
they
could
said
bonaparte
and
if
not
why
i
ll
do
my
best
for
you
i
ll
send
it
to
england
it
must
be
done
somehow
how
long
have
you
worked
at
it
nine
months
said
the
boy
oh
it
is
such
a
nice
little
machine
said
bonaparte
one
can
t
help
feeling
an
interest
in
it
there
is
only
one
little
improvement
one
very
little
improvement
i
should
like
to
bonaparte
put
his
foot
on
the
machine
and
crushed
it
into
the
sand
the
boy
looked
up
into
his
face
looks
better
now
said
bonaparte
doesn
t
it
if
we
can
t
have
it
made
in
england
we
ll
send
it
to
america
he
added
you
re
a
great
genius
a
born
genius
my
dear
boy
there
s
no
doubt
about
he
mounted
the
grey
mare
and
rode
off
the
dog
watched
his
retreat
with
cynical
satisfaction
but
his
master
lay
on
the
ground
with
his
head
on
his
arms
in
the
sand
and
the
little
wheels
and
chips
of
wood
lay
on
the
ground
around
him
the
dog
jumped
on
to
his
back
and
snapped
at
the
black
curls
till
finding
that
no
notice
was
taken
he
walked
off
to
play
with
a
black
beetle
the
beetle
was
hard
at
work
trying
to
roll
home
a
great
ball
of
dung
it
had
been
collecting
all
the
morning
but
doss
broke
the
ball
and
ate
the
beetle
s
hind
legs
and
then
bit
off
its
head
and
it
was
all
play
and
no
one
could
tell
what
it
had
lived
and
worked
for
a
striving
and
a
striving
and
an
ending
in
nothing
chapter
he
snaps
i
have
found
something
in
the
loft
said
em
to
waldo
who
was
listlessly
piling
cakes
of
fuel
on
the
kraal
wall
a
week
after
it
is
a
box
of
books
that
belonged
to
my
father
we
thought
tant
sannie
had
burnt
the
boy
put
down
the
cake
he
was
raising
and
looked
at
her
i
don
t
think
they
are
very
nice
not
stories
she
added
but
you
can
go
and
take
any
you
so
saying
she
took
up
the
plate
in
which
she
had
brought
his
breakfast
and
walked
off
to
the
house
after
that
the
boy
worked
quickly
the
pile
of
fuel
bonaparte
had
ordered
him
to
pack
was
on
the
wall
in
half
an
hour
he
then
went
to
throw
salt
on
the
skins
laid
out
to
dry
finding
the
pot
empty
he
went
to
the
loft
to
refill
it
bonaparte
blenkins
whose
door
opened
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
saw
the
boy
go
up
and
stood
in
the
doorway
waiting
for
his
return
he
wanted
his
boots
blacked
doss
finding
he
could
not
follow
his
master
up
the
round
bars
sat
patiently
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
presently
he
looked
up
longingly
but
no
one
appeared
then
bonaparte
looked
up
also
and
began
to
call
but
there
was
no
answer
what
could
the
boy
be
doing
the
loft
was
an
unknown
land
to
bonaparte
he
had
often
wondered
what
was
up
there
he
liked
to
know
what
was
in
all
places
and
corners
but
he
was
afraid
to
climb
the
ladder
so
bonaparte
looked
up
and
in
the
name
of
all
that
was
tantalizing
questioned
what
the
boy
did
up
there
the
loft
was
used
only
as
a
what
could
the
fellow
find
up
there
to
keep
him
so
long
could
the
have
beheld
waldo
at
that
instant
any
lingering
doubt
which
might
have
remained
in
her
mind
as
to
the
boy
s
insanity
would
instantly
have
vanished
for
having
filled
the
he
proceeded
to
look
for
the
box
of
books
among
the
rubbish
that
filled
the
loft
under
a
pile
of
sacks
he
found
it
a
rough
nailed
up
but
with
one
loose
plank
he
lifted
that
and
saw
the
even
backs
of
a
row
of
books
he
knelt
down
before
the
box
and
ran
his
hand
along
its
rough
edges
as
if
to
assure
himself
of
its
existence
he
stuck
his
hand
in
among
the
books
and
pulled
out
two
he
felt
them
thrust
his
fingers
in
among
the
leaves
and
crumpled
them
a
little
as
a
lover
feels
the
hair
of
his
mistress
the
fellow
gloated
over
his
treasure
he
had
had
a
dozen
books
in
the
course
of
his
life
now
here
was
a
mine
of
them
opened
at
his
feet
after
a
while
he
began
to
read
the
titles
and
now
and
again
opened
a
book
and
read
a
sentence
but
he
was
too
excited
to
catch
the
meanings
distinctly
at
last
he
came
to
a
dull
brown
volume
he
read
the
name
opened
it
in
the
centre
and
where
he
opened
began
to
read
it
was
a
chapter
on
property
that
he
fell
upon
communism
fourierism
simonism
in
a
work
on
political
economy
he
read
down
one
page
and
turned
over
to
the
next
he
read
down
that
without
changing
his
posture
by
an
inch
he
read
the
next
and
the
next
kneeling
up
all
the
while
with
the
book
in
his
hand
and
his
lips
parted
all
he
read
he
did
not
fully
understand
the
thoughts
were
new
to
him
but
this
was
the
fellow
s
startled
joy
in
the
book
the
thoughts
were
his
they
belonged
to
him
he
had
never
thought
them
before
but
they
were
his
he
laughed
silently
and
internally
with
the
still
intensity
of
triumphant
joy
so
then
all
thinking
creatures
did
not
send
up
the
one
cry
as
thou
dear
lord
has
created
things
in
the
beginning
so
are
they
now
so
ought
they
to
be
so
will
they
be
world
without
end
and
it
doesn
t
concern
us
what
they
are
there
were
men
to
whom
not
only
kopjes
and
stones
were
calling
out
imperatively
what
are
we
and
how
came
we
here
understand
us
and
know
us
but
to
whom
even
the
old
old
relations
between
man
and
man
and
the
customs
of
the
ages
called
and
could
not
be
made
still
and
forgotten
the
boy
s
heavy
body
quivered
with
excitement
so
he
was
not
alone
not
alone
he
could
not
quite
have
told
any
one
why
he
was
so
glad
and
this
warmth
had
come
to
him
his
cheeks
were
burning
no
wonder
that
bonaparte
called
in
vain
and
doss
put
his
paws
on
the
ladder
and
whined
till
of
an
hour
had
passed
at
last
the
boy
put
the
book
in
his
breast
and
buttoned
it
tightly
to
him
he
took
up
the
salt
pot
and
went
to
the
top
of
the
ladder
bonaparte
with
his
hands
folded
under
his
looked
up
when
he
appeared
and
accosted
him
you
ve
been
rather
a
long
time
up
there
my
lad
he
said
as
the
boy
descended
with
a
tremulous
haste
most
unlike
his
ordinary
slow
movements
you
didn
t
hear
me
calling
i
suppose
bonaparte
whisked
the
tails
of
his
coat
up
and
down
as
he
looked
at
him
he
bonaparte
blenkins
had
eyes
which
were
very
he
looked
at
the
pot
it
was
rather
a
small
pot
to
have
taken
of
an
hour
in
the
filling
he
looked
at
the
face
it
was
flushed
and
yet
tant
sannie
kept
no
wine
he
had
not
been
drinking
his
eyes
were
wide
open
and
bright
he
had
not
been
sleeping
there
was
no
girl
up
there
he
had
not
been
making
love
bonaparte
looked
at
him
sagaciously
what
would
account
for
the
marvellous
change
in
the
boy
coming
down
the
ladder
from
the
boy
going
up
the
ladder
one
thing
there
was
did
not
tant
sannie
keep
in
the
loft
bultongs
and
nice
smoked
sausages
there
must
be
something
nice
to
eat
up
there
aha
that
was
it
bonaparte
was
so
interested
in
carrying
out
this
chain
of
inductive
reasoning
that
he
quite
forgot
to
have
his
boots
blacked
he
watched
the
boy
shuffle
off
with
the
under
his
arm
then
he
stood
in
his
doorway
and
raised
his
eyes
to
the
quiet
blue
sky
and
audibly
propounded
this
riddle
to
himself
what
is
the
connection
between
the
naked
back
of
a
certain
boy
with
a
greatcoat
on
and
a
under
his
arm
and
the
tip
of
a
horsewhip
answer
no
connection
at
present
but
there
will
be
bonaparte
was
so
pleased
with
this
sally
of
his
wit
that
he
chuckled
a
little
and
went
to
lie
down
on
his
bed
there
was
that
afternoon
and
there
was
a
fire
lighted
in
the
brick
oven
behind
the
house
and
tant
sannie
had
left
the
great
chair
in
which
she
passed
her
life
and
waddled
out
to
look
at
it
not
far
off
was
waldo
who
having
thrown
a
pail
of
food
into
the
pigsty
now
leaned
over
the
sod
wall
looking
at
the
pigs
half
of
the
sty
was
dry
but
the
lower
half
was
a
pool
of
mud
on
the
edge
of
which
the
mother
sow
lay
with
closed
eyes
her
ten
little
ones
sucking
the
father
pig
in
the
mud
stood
running
his
snout
into
a
rotten
pumpkin
and
wriggling
his
curled
tail
waldo
wondered
dreamily
as
he
stared
why
they
were
pleasant
to
look
at
taken
singly
they
were
not
beautiful
taken
together
they
were
was
it
not
because
there
was
a
certain
harmony
about
them
the
old
sow
was
suited
to
the
little
pigs
and
the
little
pigs
to
their
mother
the
old
boar
to
the
rotten
pumpkin
and
all
to
the
mud
they
suggested
the
thought
of
nothing
that
should
be
added
of
nothing
that
should
be
taken
away
and
he
wondered
on
vaguely
was
not
that
the
secret
of
all
beauty
that
you
who
look
on
so
he
stood
dreaming
and
leaned
further
and
further
over
the
sod
wall
and
looked
at
the
pigs
all
this
time
bonaparte
blenkins
was
sloping
down
from
the
house
in
an
aimless
sort
of
way
but
he
kept
one
eye
fixed
on
the
pigsty
and
each
gyration
brought
him
nearer
to
it
waldo
stood
like
a
thing
asleep
when
bonaparte
came
close
up
to
him
in
old
days
when
a
small
boy
playing
in
an
irish
he
bonaparte
had
been
familiarly
known
among
his
comrades
under
the
title
of
tripping
ben
this
from
the
rare
ease
and
dexterity
with
which
by
merely
projecting
his
foot
he
could
precipitate
any
unfortunate
companion
on
to
the
crown
of
his
head
years
had
elapsed
and
tripping
ben
had
become
bonaparte
but
the
old
gift
was
in
him
still
he
came
close
to
the
pigsty
all
the
defunct
memories
of
his
boyhood
returned
on
him
in
a
flood
as
with
an
adroit
movement
he
inserted
his
leg
between
waldo
and
the
wall
and
sent
him
over
into
the
pigsty
the
little
pigs
were
startled
at
the
strange
intruder
and
ran
behind
their
mother
who
sniffed
at
him
tant
sannie
smote
her
hands
together
and
laughed
but
bonaparte
was
far
from
joining
her
lost
in
reverie
he
gazed
at
the
distant
horizon
the
sudden
reversal
of
head
and
feet
had
thrown
out
the
volume
that
waldo
carried
in
his
breast
bonaparte
picked
it
up
and
began
to
inspect
it
as
the
boy
climbed
slowly
over
the
wall
he
would
have
walked
off
sullenly
but
he
wanted
his
book
and
he
waited
until
it
should
be
given
him
ha
said
bonaparte
raising
his
eyes
from
the
leaves
of
the
book
which
he
was
examining
i
hope
your
coat
has
not
been
injured
it
is
of
an
elegant
cut
an
heirloom
i
presume
from
your
paternal
grandfather
it
looks
nice
oh
lord
oh
lord
cried
tant
sannie
laughing
and
holding
her
sides
how
the
child
looks
as
though
he
thought
the
mud
would
never
wash
off
oh
lord
i
shall
die
you
bonaparte
are
the
funniest
man
i
ever
bonaparte
blenkins
was
now
carefully
inspecting
the
volume
he
had
picked
up
among
the
subjects
on
which
the
darkness
of
his
understanding
had
been
enlightened
during
his
youth
political
economy
had
not
been
one
he
was
not
therefore
very
clear
as
to
what
the
nature
of
the
book
might
be
and
as
the
name
of
the
writer
mill
might
for
anything
he
knew
to
the
contrary
have
belonged
to
a
venerable
member
of
the
british
and
foreign
bible
society
it
by
no
means
threw
light
upon
the
question
he
was
not
in
any
way
sure
that
political
economy
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
cheapest
way
of
procuring
clothing
for
the
army
and
navy
which
would
be
certainly
both
a
political
and
economical
subject
but
bonaparte
soon
came
to
a
conclusion
as
to
the
nature
of
the
book
and
its
contents
by
the
application
of
a
simple
rule
now
largely
acted
upon
but
which
becoming
universal
would
save
much
thought
and
valuable
time
it
is
of
marvellous
simplicity
of
infinite
utility
of
universal
applicability
it
may
easily
be
committed
to
memory
and
runs
thus
whenever
you
come
into
contact
with
any
book
person
or
opinion
of
which
you
absolutely
comprehend
nothing
declare
that
book
person
or
opinion
to
be
immoral
bespatter
it
vituperate
against
it
strongly
insist
that
any
man
or
woman
harbouring
it
is
a
fool
or
a
knave
or
both
carefully
abstain
from
studying
it
do
all
that
in
you
lies
to
annihilate
that
book
person
or
opinion
acting
on
this
rule
so
wide
in
its
comprehensiveness
so
beautifully
simple
in
its
working
bonaparte
approached
tant
sannie
with
the
book
in
his
hand
waldo
came
a
step
nearer
eyeing
it
like
a
dog
whose
young
has
fallen
into
evil
hands
this
book
said
bonaparte
is
not
a
fit
and
proper
study
for
a
young
and
immature
tant
sannie
did
not
understand
a
word
and
said
what
this
book
said
bonaparte
bringing
down
his
finger
with
energy
on
the
cover
this
book
is
sleg
sleg
davel
davel
tant
sannie
perceived
from
the
gravity
of
his
countenance
that
it
was
no
laughing
matter
from
the
words
sleg
and
davel
she
understood
that
the
book
was
evil
and
had
some
connection
with
the
prince
who
pulls
the
wires
of
evil
over
the
whole
earth
where
did
you
get
this
book
she
asked
turning
her
twinkling
little
eyes
on
waldo
i
wish
that
my
legs
may
be
as
thin
as
an
englishman
s
if
it
isn
t
one
of
your
father
s
he
had
more
sins
than
all
the
kaffers
in
kafferland
for
all
that
he
pretended
to
be
so
good
all
those
years
and
to
live
without
a
wife
because
he
was
thinking
of
the
one
that
was
dead
as
though
ten
dead
wives
could
make
up
for
one
fat
one
with
arms
and
legs
cried
tant
sannie
snorting
it
was
not
my
father
s
book
said
the
boy
savagely
i
got
it
from
your
my
loft
my
book
how
dare
you
cried
tant
sannie
it
was
em
s
father
s
she
gave
it
me
he
muttered
more
sullenly
give
it
here
what
is
the
name
of
it
what
is
it
about
she
asked
putting
her
finger
upon
the
title
bonaparte
understood
political
economy
he
said
slowly
dear
lord
said
tant
sannie
can
not
one
hear
from
the
very
sound
what
an
ungodly
book
it
is
one
can
hardly
say
the
name
haven
t
we
got
curses
enough
on
this
farm
cried
tant
sannie
eloquently
my
best
imported
merino
ram
dying
of
nobody
knows
what
and
the
cow
casting
her
two
calves
and
the
sheep
eaten
up
with
the
scab
and
the
drought
and
is
this
a
time
to
bring
ungodly
things
about
the
place
to
call
down
the
vengeance
of
almighty
god
to
punish
us
more
didn
t
the
minister
tell
me
when
i
was
confirmed
not
to
read
any
book
except
my
bible
and
that
the
devil
was
in
all
the
rest
and
i
never
have
read
any
other
book
said
tant
sannie
with
virtuous
energy
and
i
never
will
waldo
saw
that
the
fate
of
his
book
was
sealed
and
turned
sullenly
on
his
heel
so
you
will
not
stay
to
hear
what
i
say
cried
tant
sannie
there
take
your
your
devil
s
book
she
cried
flinging
the
book
at
his
head
with
much
energy
it
merely
touched
his
forehead
on
one
side
and
fell
to
the
ground
go
on
she
cried
i
know
you
are
going
to
talk
to
yourself
people
who
talk
to
themselves
always
talk
to
the
devil
go
and
tell
him
all
about
it
go
go
run
cried
tant
sannie
but
the
boy
neither
quickened
nor
slackened
his
pace
and
passed
sullenly
round
the
back
of
the
books
have
been
thrown
at
other
heads
before
and
since
that
summer
afternoon
by
hands
more
white
and
delicate
than
those
of
the
but
whether
the
result
of
the
process
has
been
in
any
case
wholly
satisfactory
may
be
questioned
we
love
that
with
a
peculiar
tenderness
we
treasure
it
with
a
peculiar
care
it
has
for
us
quite
a
fictitious
value
for
which
we
have
suffered
if
we
may
not
carry
it
anywhere
else
we
will
carry
it
in
our
hearts
and
always
to
the
end
bonaparte
blenkins
went
to
pick
up
the
volume
now
loosened
from
its
cover
while
tant
sannie
pushed
the
stumps
of
wood
further
into
the
oven
bonaparte
came
close
to
her
tapped
the
book
knowingly
nodded
and
looked
at
the
fire
tant
sannie
comprehended
and
taking
the
volume
from
his
hand
threw
it
into
the
back
of
the
oven
it
lay
upon
the
heap
of
coals
smoked
flared
and
blazed
and
the
political
economy
was
no
more
gone
out
of
existence
like
many
another
poor
heretic
of
flesh
and
blood
bonaparte
grinned
and
to
watch
the
process
brought
his
face
so
near
the
oven
door
that
the
white
hair
on
his
eyebrows
got
singed
he
then
inquired
if
there
were
any
more
in
the
loft
learning
that
there
were
he
made
signs
indicative
of
taking
up
armfuls
and
flinging
them
into
the
fire
but
tant
sannie
was
dubious
the
deceased
englishman
had
left
all
his
personal
effects
specially
to
his
child
it
was
all
very
well
for
bonaparte
to
talk
of
burning
the
books
he
had
had
his
hair
spiritually
pulled
and
she
had
no
wish
to
repeat
his
experience
she
shook
her
head
bonaparte
was
displeased
but
then
a
happy
thought
occurred
to
him
he
suggested
that
the
key
of
the
loft
should
henceforth
be
put
into
his
own
safe
care
and
keeping
no
one
gaining
possession
of
it
without
his
permission
to
this
tant
sannie
readily
assented
and
the
two
walked
lovingly
to
the
house
to
look
for
it
chapter
he
bites
bonaparte
blenkins
was
riding
home
on
the
grey
mare
he
had
ridden
out
that
afternoon
partly
for
the
benefit
of
his
health
partly
to
maintain
his
character
as
overseer
of
the
farm
as
he
rode
on
slowly
he
thoughtfully
touched
the
ears
of
the
grey
mare
with
his
whip
no
bon
my
boy
he
addressed
himself
don
t
propose
you
can
t
marry
for
four
years
on
account
of
the
will
then
why
propose
wheedle
her
tweedle
her
teedle
her
but
don
t
let
her
make
sure
of
you
when
a
woman
said
bonaparte
sagely
resting
his
finger
against
the
side
of
his
nose
when
a
woman
is
sure
of
you
she
does
what
she
likes
with
you
but
when
she
isn
t
you
do
what
you
like
with
her
and
i
said
bonaparte
here
he
drew
the
horse
up
suddenly
and
looked
he
was
now
close
to
the
house
and
leaning
over
the
pigsty
wall
in
company
with
em
who
was
showing
her
the
pigs
was
a
strange
female
figure
it
was
the
first
visitor
that
had
appeared
on
the
farm
since
his
arrival
and
he
looked
at
her
with
interest
she
was
a
tall
pudgy
girl
of
fifteen
weighing
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
with
baggy
pendulous
cheeks
and
nose
she
strikingly
resembled
tant
sannie
in
form
and
feature
but
her
sleepy
good
eyes
lacked
that
twinkle
that
dwelt
in
the
s
small
orbs
she
was
attired
in
a
bright
green
print
wore
brass
rings
in
her
ears
and
glass
beads
round
her
neck
and
was
sucking
the
tip
of
her
large
finger
as
she
looked
at
the
pigs
who
is
it
that
has
come
asked
bonaparte
when
he
stood
drinking
his
coffee
in
the
front
room
why
my
niece
to
be
sure
said
tant
sannie
the
hottentot
maid
translating
she
s
the
only
daughter
of
my
only
brother
paul
and
she
s
come
to
visit
me
she
ll
be
a
nice
mouthful
to
the
man
that
can
get
her
added
tant
sannie
her
father
s
got
two
thousand
pounds
in
the
green
wagon
box
under
his
bed
and
a
farm
and
five
thousand
sheep
and
god
almighty
knows
how
many
goats
and
horses
they
milk
ten
cows
in
and
the
young
men
are
after
her
like
flies
about
a
bowl
of
milk
she
says
she
means
to
get
married
in
four
months
but
she
doesn
t
yet
know
to
whom
it
was
so
with
me
when
i
was
young
said
tant
sannie
i
ve
sat
up
with
the
young
men
four
and
five
nights
a
week
and
they
will
come
riding
again
as
soon
as
ever
they
know
that
the
time
s
up
that
the
englishman
made
me
agree
not
to
marry
the
smirked
complacently
where
are
you
going
to
asked
tant
sannie
presently
seeing
that
bonaparte
rose
ha
i
m
just
going
to
the
kraals
i
ll
be
in
to
supper
said
bonaparte
nevertheless
when
he
reached
his
own
door
he
stopped
and
turned
in
there
soon
after
he
stood
before
the
little
glass
arrayed
in
his
best
white
shirt
with
the
little
tucks
and
shaving
himself
he
had
on
his
very
best
trousers
and
had
heavily
oiled
the
little
fringe
at
the
back
of
his
head
which
however
refused
to
become
darker
but
what
distressed
him
most
was
his
nose
it
was
very
red
he
rubbed
his
finger
and
thumb
on
the
wall
and
put
a
little
whitewash
on
it
but
finding
it
rather
made
matters
worse
he
rubbed
it
off
again
then
he
looked
carefully
into
his
own
eyes
they
certainly
were
a
little
pulled
down
at
the
outer
corners
which
gave
them
the
appearance
of
looking
crosswise
but
then
they
were
a
nice
blue
so
he
put
on
his
best
coat
took
up
his
stick
and
went
out
to
supper
feeling
on
the
whole
well
satisfied
aunt
said
trana
to
tant
sannie
when
that
night
they
lay
together
in
the
great
wooden
bed
why
does
the
englishman
sigh
so
when
he
looks
at
me
ha
said
tant
sannie
who
was
half
asleep
but
suddenly
started
wide
awake
it
s
because
he
thinks
you
look
like
me
i
tell
you
trana
said
tant
sannie
the
man
is
mad
with
love
of
me
i
told
him
the
other
night
i
couldn
t
marry
till
em
was
sixteen
or
i
d
lose
all
the
sheep
her
father
left
me
and
he
talked
about
jacob
working
seven
years
and
seven
years
again
for
his
wife
and
of
course
he
meant
me
said
tant
sannie
pompously
but
he
won
t
get
me
so
easily
as
he
thinks
he
ll
have
to
ask
more
than
oh
said
trana
who
was
a
lumpish
girl
and
not
much
given
to
talking
but
presently
she
added
aunt
why
does
the
englishman
always
knock
against
a
person
when
he
passes
them
that
s
because
you
are
always
in
the
way
said
tant
sannie
but
aunt
said
trana
presently
i
think
he
is
very
phugh
said
tant
sannie
it
s
only
because
we
re
not
accustomed
to
such
noses
in
this
country
in
his
country
he
says
all
the
people
have
such
noses
and
the
redder
your
nose
is
the
higher
you
are
he
s
of
the
family
of
the
queen
victoria
you
know
said
tant
sannie
wakening
up
with
her
subject
and
he
doesn
t
think
anything
of
governors
and
church
elders
and
such
people
they
are
nothing
to
him
when
his
aunt
with
the
dropsy
dies
he
ll
have
money
enough
to
buy
all
the
farms
in
this
oh
said
trana
that
certainly
made
a
difference
yes
said
tant
sannie
and
he
s
only
though
you
d
take
him
to
be
sixty
and
he
told
me
last
night
the
real
reason
of
his
tant
sannie
then
proceeded
to
relate
how
at
eighteen
years
of
age
bonaparte
had
courted
a
fair
young
lady
how
a
deadly
rival
jealous
of
his
verdant
locks
his
golden
flowing
hair
had
with
a
damnable
and
insinuating
deception
made
him
a
present
of
a
pot
of
pomatum
how
applying
it
in
the
evening
on
rising
in
the
morning
he
found
his
pillow
strewn
with
the
golden
locks
and
looking
into
the
glass
beheld
the
shining
and
smooth
expanse
which
henceforth
he
must
bear
the
few
remaining
hairs
were
turned
to
a
silvery
whiteness
and
the
young
lady
married
his
rival
and
said
tant
sannie
solemnly
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
grace
of
god
and
reading
of
the
psalms
he
says
he
would
have
killed
himself
he
says
he
could
kill
himself
quite
easily
if
he
wants
to
marry
a
woman
and
she
won
alle
wereld
said
trana
and
then
they
went
to
sleep
every
one
was
lost
in
sleep
soon
but
from
the
window
of
the
cabin
the
light
streamed
forth
it
came
from
a
dung
fire
over
which
waldo
sat
brooding
hour
after
hour
he
sat
there
now
and
again
throwing
a
fresh
lump
of
fuel
on
to
the
fire
which
burnt
up
bravely
and
then
sank
into
a
great
bed
of
red
coals
which
reflected
themselves
in
the
boy
s
eyes
as
he
sat
there
brooding
brooding
brooding
at
last
when
the
fire
was
blazing
at
its
brightest
he
rose
suddenly
and
walked
slowly
to
a
beam
from
which
an
ox
riem
hung
loosening
it
he
ran
a
noose
in
one
end
and
then
doubled
it
round
his
arm
mine
mine
i
have
a
right
he
muttered
and
then
something
louder
if
i
fall
and
am
killed
so
much
the
better
he
opened
the
door
and
went
out
into
the
starlight
he
walked
with
his
eyes
bent
upon
the
ground
but
overhead
it
was
one
of
those
brilliant
southern
nights
when
every
space
so
small
that
your
hand
might
cover
it
shows
fifty
cold
white
points
and
the
is
a
belt
of
sharp
frosted
silver
he
passed
the
door
where
bonaparte
lay
dreaming
of
trana
and
her
wealth
and
he
mounted
the
ladder
steps
from
those
he
clambered
with
some
difficulty
on
to
the
roof
of
the
house
it
was
of
old
rotten
thatch
with
a
ridge
of
white
plaster
and
it
crumbled
away
under
his
feet
at
every
step
he
trod
as
heavily
as
he
could
so
much
the
better
if
he
fell
he
knelt
down
when
he
got
to
the
far
gable
and
began
to
fasten
his
riem
to
the
crumbling
bricks
below
was
the
little
window
of
the
loft
with
one
end
of
the
riem
tied
round
the
gable
the
other
end
round
his
waist
how
easy
to
slide
down
to
it
and
to
open
it
through
one
of
the
broken
panes
and
to
go
in
and
to
fill
his
arms
with
books
and
to
clamber
up
again
they
had
burnt
one
book
he
would
have
twenty
every
man
s
hand
was
against
his
his
should
be
against
every
man
s
no
one
would
help
him
he
would
help
himself
he
lifted
the
black
damp
hair
from
his
knit
forehead
and
looked
round
to
cool
his
hot
face
then
he
saw
what
a
regal
night
it
was
he
knelt
silently
and
looked
up
a
thousand
eyes
were
looking
down
at
him
bright
and
so
cold
there
was
a
laughing
irony
in
them
so
hot
so
bitter
so
angry
poor
little
mortal
he
was
ashamed
he
folded
his
arms
and
sat
on
the
ridge
of
the
roof
looking
up
at
them
so
hot
so
bitter
so
angry
it
was
as
though
a
cold
hand
had
been
laid
upon
his
throbbing
forehead
and
slowly
they
began
to
fade
and
grow
dim
tant
sannie
and
the
burnt
book
bonaparte
and
the
broken
machine
the
box
in
the
loft
he
himself
sitting
there
how
small
they
all
became
even
the
grave
over
yonder
those
stars
that
shone
on
up
above
so
quietly
they
had
seen
a
thousand
such
little
existences
fight
just
so
fiercely
flare
up
just
so
brightly
and
go
out
and
they
the
old
old
stars
shone
on
forever
so
hot
so
angry
poor
little
soul
they
said
the
riem
slipped
from
his
fingers
he
sat
with
his
arms
folded
looking
up
we
said
the
stars
have
seen
the
earth
when
it
was
young
we
have
seen
small
things
creep
out
upon
its
surface
small
things
that
prayed
and
loved
and
cried
very
loudly
and
then
crept
under
it
again
but
we
said
the
stars
are
as
old
as
the
he
leaned
his
chin
against
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
looked
up
at
them
so
long
he
sat
there
that
bright
stars
set
and
new
ones
rose
and
yet
he
sat
on
then
at
last
he
stood
up
and
began
to
loosen
the
riem
from
the
gable
what
did
it
matter
about
the
books
the
lust
and
the
desire
for
them
had
died
out
if
they
pleased
to
keep
them
from
him
they
might
what
matter
it
was
a
very
little
thing
why
hate
and
struggle
and
fight
let
it
be
as
it
would
he
twisted
the
riem
round
his
arm
and
walked
back
along
the
ridge
of
the
house
by
this
time
bonaparte
blenkins
had
finished
his
dream
of
trana
and
as
he
turned
himself
round
for
a
fresh
doze
he
heard
the
steps
descending
the
ladder
his
first
impulse
was
to
draw
the
blanket
over
his
head
and
his
legs
under
him
and
to
shout
but
recollecting
that
the
door
was
locked
and
the
window
carefully
bolted
he
allowed
his
head
slowly
to
crop
out
among
the
blankets
and
listened
intently
whosoever
it
might
be
there
was
no
danger
of
their
getting
at
him
so
he
clambered
out
of
bed
and
going
on
tiptoe
to
the
door
applied
his
eye
to
the
keyhole
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
so
walking
to
the
window
he
brought
his
face
as
close
to
the
glass
as
his
nose
would
allow
there
was
a
figure
just
discernible
the
lad
was
not
trying
to
walk
softly
and
the
heavy
shuffling
of
the
velschoens
could
be
clearly
heard
through
the
closed
window
as
they
crossed
the
stones
in
the
yard
bonaparte
listened
till
they
had
died
away
round
the
corner
of
the
and
feeling
that
his
bare
legs
were
getting
cold
he
jumped
back
into
bed
again
what
do
you
keep
up
in
your
loft
inquired
bonaparte
of
the
the
next
evening
pointing
upwards
and
elucidating
his
meaning
by
the
addition
of
such
dutch
words
as
he
knew
for
the
lean
hottentot
was
gone
home
dried
skins
said
the
and
empty
bottles
and
boxes
and
sacks
and
you
don
t
keep
any
of
your
provisions
there
sugar
now
said
bonaparte
pointing
to
the
and
then
up
at
the
loft
tant
sannie
shook
her
head
only
salt
and
dried
dried
peaches
eh
said
bonaparte
shut
the
door
my
dear
child
shut
it
tight
he
called
out
to
em
who
stood
in
the
dining
room
then
he
leaned
over
the
elbow
of
the
sofa
and
brought
his
face
as
close
as
possible
to
the
s
and
made
signs
of
eating
then
he
said
something
she
did
not
comprehend
then
said
waldo
waldo
waldo
pointed
up
to
the
loft
and
made
signs
of
eating
again
now
an
inkling
of
his
meaning
dawned
on
the
s
mind
to
make
it
clearer
he
moved
his
legs
after
the
manner
of
one
going
up
a
ladder
appeared
to
be
opening
a
door
masticated
vigorously
said
peaches
peaches
peaches
and
appeared
to
be
coming
down
the
ladder
it
was
now
evident
to
tant
sannie
that
waldo
had
been
in
her
loft
and
eaten
her
peaches
to
exemplify
his
own
share
in
the
proceedings
bonaparte
lay
down
on
the
sofa
and
shutting
his
eyes
tightly
said
night
night
night
then
he
sat
up
wildly
appearing
to
be
intently
listening
mimicked
with
his
feet
the
coming
down
a
ladder
and
looked
at
tant
sannie
this
clearly
showed
how
roused
in
the
night
he
had
discovered
the
theft
he
must
have
been
a
great
fool
to
eat
my
peaches
said
tant
sannie
they
are
full
of
mites
as
a
sheepskin
and
as
hard
as
bonaparte
fumbling
in
his
pocket
did
not
even
hear
her
remark
and
took
out
from
his
a
little
horsewhip
nicely
rolled
up
bonaparte
winked
at
the
little
rhinoceros
horsewhip
at
the
and
then
at
the
door
shall
we
call
him
waldo
waldo
he
said
tant
sannie
nodded
and
giggled
there
was
something
so
exceedingly
humorous
in
the
idea
that
he
was
going
to
beat
the
boy
though
for
her
own
part
she
did
not
see
that
the
peaches
were
worth
it
when
the
kaffer
maid
came
with
the
she
was
sent
to
summon
waldo
and
bonaparte
doubled
up
the
little
whip
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
then
he
drew
himself
up
and
prepared
to
act
his
important
part
with
becoming
gravity
soon
waldo
stood
in
the
door
and
took
off
his
hat
come
in
come
in
my
lad
said
bonaparte
and
shut
the
door
the
boy
came
in
and
stood
before
them
you
need
not
be
so
afraid
child
said
tant
sannie
i
was
a
child
myself
once
it
s
no
great
harm
if
you
have
taken
a
bonaparte
perceived
that
her
remark
was
not
in
keeping
with
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
and
of
the
little
drama
he
intended
to
act
pursing
out
his
lips
and
waving
his
hand
he
solemnly
addressed
the
boy
waldo
it
grieves
me
beyond
expression
to
have
to
summon
you
for
so
painful
a
purpose
but
it
is
at
the
imperative
call
of
duty
which
i
dare
not
evade
i
do
not
state
that
frank
and
unreserved
confession
will
obviate
the
necessity
of
chastisement
which
if
requisite
shall
be
fully
administered
but
the
nature
of
that
chastisement
may
be
mitigated
by
free
and
humble
confession
waldo
answer
me
as
you
would
your
own
father
in
whose
place
i
now
stand
to
you
have
you
or
have
you
not
did
you
or
did
you
not
eat
of
the
peaches
in
the
loft
say
you
took
them
boy
say
you
took
them
then
he
won
t
beat
you
much
said
the
dutchwoman
getting
a
little
sorry
for
him
the
boy
raised
his
eyes
slowly
and
fixed
them
vacantly
upon
her
then
suddenly
his
face
grew
dark
with
blood
so
you
haven
t
got
anything
to
say
to
us
my
lad
said
bonaparte
momentarily
forgetting
his
dignity
and
bending
forward
with
a
little
snarl
but
what
i
mean
is
just
this
my
lad
when
it
takes
a
boy
of
an
hour
to
fill
a
and
when
at
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
he
goes
knocking
about
the
doors
of
a
loft
it
s
natural
to
suppose
there
s
mischief
in
it
it
s
certain
there
is
mischief
in
it
and
where
there
s
mischief
in
it
must
be
taken
out
said
bonaparte
grinning
into
the
boy
s
face
then
feeling
that
he
had
fallen
from
that
high
gravity
which
was
as
spice
to
the
pudding
and
the
flavour
of
the
whole
little
tragedy
he
drew
himself
up
waldo
he
said
confess
to
me
instantly
and
without
reserve
that
you
ate
the
the
boy
s
face
was
white
now
his
eyes
were
on
the
ground
his
hands
doggedly
clasped
before
him
what
do
you
not
intend
to
answer
the
boy
looked
up
at
them
once
from
under
his
bent
eyebrows
and
then
looked
down
again
the
creature
looks
as
if
all
the
devils
in
hell
were
in
it
cried
tant
sannie
say
you
took
them
boy
young
things
will
be
young
things
i
was
older
than
you
when
i
used
to
eat
bultong
in
my
mother
s
loft
and
get
the
little
niggers
whipped
for
it
say
you
took
but
the
boy
said
nothing
i
think
a
little
solitary
confinement
might
perhaps
be
beneficial
said
bonaparte
it
will
enable
you
waldo
to
reflect
on
the
enormity
of
the
sin
you
have
committed
against
our
father
in
heaven
and
you
may
also
think
of
the
submission
you
owe
to
those
who
are
older
and
wiser
than
you
are
and
whose
duty
it
is
to
check
and
correct
saying
this
bonaparte
stood
up
and
took
down
the
key
of
the
which
hung
on
a
nail
against
the
wall
walk
on
my
boy
said
bonaparte
pointing
to
the
door
and
as
he
followed
him
out
he
drew
his
mouth
expressively
on
one
side
and
made
the
lash
of
the
little
horsewhip
stick
out
of
his
pocket
and
shake
up
and
down
tant
sannie
felt
half
sorry
for
the
lad
but
she
could
not
help
laughing
it
was
always
so
funny
when
one
was
going
to
have
a
whipping
and
it
would
do
him
good
anyhow
he
would
forget
all
about
it
when
the
places
were
healed
had
not
she
been
beaten
many
times
and
been
all
the
better
for
it
bonaparte
took
up
a
lighted
candle
that
had
been
left
burning
on
the
kitchen
table
and
told
the
boy
to
walk
before
him
they
went
to
the
it
was
a
little
stone
erection
that
jutted
out
from
the
side
of
the
it
was
low
and
without
a
window
and
the
dried
dung
was
piled
in
one
corner
and
the
stood
in
another
fastened
on
the
top
of
a
short
post
about
three
feet
high
bonaparte
took
the
padlock
off
the
rough
door
walk
in
my
lad
he
said
waldo
obeyed
sullenly
one
place
to
him
was
much
the
same
as
another
he
had
no
objection
to
being
locked
up
bonaparte
followed
him
in
and
closed
the
door
carefully
he
put
the
light
down
on
the
heap
of
dung
in
the
corner
and
quietly
introduced
his
hand
under
his
and
drew
slowly
from
his
pocket
the
end
of
a
rope
which
he
concealed
behind
him
i
m
very
sorry
exceedingly
sorry
waldo
my
lad
that
you
should
have
acted
in
this
manner
it
grieves
me
said
bonaparte
he
moved
round
toward
the
boy
s
back
he
hardly
liked
the
look
in
the
fellow
s
eyes
though
he
stood
there
motionless
if
he
should
spring
on
him
so
he
drew
the
rope
out
very
carefully
and
shifted
round
to
the
wooden
post
there
was
a
slipknot
in
one
end
of
the
rope
and
a
sudden
movement
drew
the
boy
s
hands
to
his
back
and
passed
it
round
them
it
was
an
instant
s
work
to
drag
it
twice
round
the
wooden
post
then
bonaparte
was
safe
for
a
moment
the
boy
struggled
to
free
himself
then
he
knew
that
he
was
powerless
and
stood
still
horses
that
kick
must
have
their
legs
tied
said
bonaparte
as
he
passed
the
other
end
of
the
rope
round
the
boy
s
knees
and
now
my
dear
waldo
taking
the
whip
out
of
his
pocket
i
am
going
to
beat
he
paused
for
a
moment
it
was
perfectly
quiet
they
could
hear
each
other
s
breath
chasten
thy
son
while
there
is
hope
said
bonaparte
and
let
not
thy
soul
spare
for
his
those
are
god
s
words
i
shall
act
as
a
father
to
you
waldo
i
think
we
had
better
have
your
naked
he
took
out
his
penknife
and
slit
the
shirt
down
from
the
shoulder
to
the
waist
now
said
bonaparte
i
hope
the
lord
will
bless
and
sanctify
to
you
what
i
am
going
to
do
to
the
first
cut
ran
from
the
shoulder
across
the
middle
of
the
back
the
second
fell
exactly
in
the
same
place
a
shudder
passed
through
the
boy
s
frame
nice
eh
said
bonaparte
peeping
round
into
his
face
speaking
with
a
lisp
as
though
to
a
very
little
child
nith
eh
but
the
eyes
were
black
and
lustreless
and
seemed
not
to
see
him
when
he
had
given
sixteen
bonaparte
paused
in
his
work
to
wipe
a
little
drop
of
blood
from
his
whip
cold
eh
what
makes
you
shiver
so
perhaps
you
would
like
to
pull
up
your
shirt
but
i
ve
not
quite
done
when
he
had
finished
he
wiped
the
whip
again
and
put
it
back
in
his
pocket
he
cut
the
rope
through
with
his
penknife
and
then
took
up
the
light
you
don
t
seem
to
have
found
your
tongue
yet
forgotten
how
to
cry
said
bonaparte
patting
him
on
the
cheek
the
boy
looked
up
at
him
not
sullenly
not
angrily
there
was
a
wild
fitful
terror
in
the
eyes
bonaparte
made
haste
to
go
out
and
shut
the
door
and
leave
him
alone
in
the
darkness
he
himself
was
afraid
of
that
look
it
was
almost
morning
waldo
lay
with
his
face
upon
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
the
there
was
a
round
hole
near
the
top
of
the
door
where
a
knot
of
wood
had
fallen
out
and
a
stream
of
grey
light
came
in
through
it
ah
it
was
going
to
end
at
last
nothing
lasts
forever
not
even
the
night
how
was
it
he
had
never
thought
of
that
before
for
in
all
that
long
dark
night
he
had
been
very
strong
had
never
been
tired
never
felt
pain
had
run
on
and
on
up
and
down
up
and
down
he
had
not
dared
to
stand
still
and
he
had
not
known
it
would
end
he
had
been
so
strong
that
when
he
struck
his
head
with
all
his
force
upon
the
stone
wall
it
did
not
stun
him
nor
pain
him
only
made
him
laugh
that
was
a
dreadful
night
when
he
clasped
his
hands
frantically
and
prayed
o
god
my
beautiful
god
my
sweet
god
once
only
once
let
me
feel
you
near
me
tonight
he
could
not
feel
him
he
prayed
aloud
very
loud
and
he
got
no
answer
when
he
listened
it
was
all
quite
quiet
like
when
the
priests
of
baal
cried
aloud
to
their
god
oh
baal
hear
us
oh
baal
hear
us
but
baal
was
gone
that
was
a
long
wild
night
and
wild
thoughts
came
and
went
in
it
but
they
left
their
marks
behind
them
forever
for
as
years
can
not
pass
without
leaving
their
traces
behind
them
neither
can
nights
into
which
are
forced
the
thoughts
and
sufferings
of
years
and
now
the
dawn
was
coming
and
at
last
he
was
very
tired
he
shivered
and
tried
to
draw
the
shirt
up
over
his
shoulders
they
were
getting
stiff
he
had
never
known
they
were
cut
in
the
night
he
looked
up
at
the
white
light
that
came
in
through
the
hole
at
the
top
of
the
door
and
shuddered
then
he
turned
his
face
back
to
the
ground
and
slept
again
some
hours
later
bonaparte
came
toward
the
with
a
lump
of
bread
in
his
hand
he
opened
the
door
and
peered
in
then
entered
and
touched
the
fellow
with
his
boot
seeing
that
he
breathed
heavily
though
he
did
not
rouse
bonaparte
threw
the
bread
down
on
the
ground
he
was
alive
that
was
one
thing
he
bent
over
him
and
carefully
scratched
open
one
of
the
cuts
with
the
nail
of
his
forefinger
examining
with
much
interest
his
last
night
s
work
he
would
have
to
count
his
sheep
himself
that
day
the
boy
was
literally
cut
up
he
locked
the
door
and
went
away
again
oh
lyndall
said
em
entering
the
dining
room
and
bathed
in
tears
that
afternoon
i
have
been
begging
bonaparte
to
let
him
out
and
he
won
the
more
you
beg
the
more
he
will
not
said
lyndall
she
was
cutting
out
aprons
on
the
table
oh
but
it
s
late
and
i
think
they
want
to
kill
him
said
em
weeping
bitterly
and
finding
that
no
more
consolation
was
to
be
gained
from
her
cousin
she
went
off
blubbering
i
wonder
you
can
cut
out
aprons
when
waldo
is
shut
up
like
for
ten
minutes
after
she
was
gone
lyndall
worked
on
quietly
then
she
folded
up
her
stuff
rolled
it
tightly
together
and
stood
before
the
closed
door
of
the
sitting
room
with
her
hands
closely
clasped
a
flush
rose
to
her
face
she
opened
the
door
quickly
and
walked
in
went
to
the
nail
on
which
the
key
of
the
hung
bonaparte
and
tant
sannie
sat
there
and
saw
her
what
do
you
want
they
asked
together
this
key
she
said
holding
it
up
and
looking
at
them
do
you
mean
her
to
have
it
said
tant
sannie
in
dutch
why
don
t
you
stop
her
asked
bonaparte
in
english
why
don
t
you
take
it
from
her
said
tant
sannie
so
they
looked
at
each
other
talking
while
lyndall
walked
to
the
with
the
key
her
underlip
bitten
in
waldo
she
said
as
she
helped
him
to
stand
up
and
twisted
his
arm
about
her
waist
to
support
him
we
will
not
be
children
always
we
shall
have
the
power
too
some
she
kissed
his
naked
shoulder
with
her
soft
little
mouth
it
was
all
the
comfort
her
young
soul
could
give
him
chapter
he
makes
love
here
said
tant
sannie
to
her
hottentot
maid
i
have
been
in
this
house
four
years
and
never
been
up
in
the
loft
fatter
women
than
i
go
up
ladders
i
will
go
up
today
and
see
what
it
is
like
and
put
it
to
rights
up
there
you
bring
the
little
ladder
and
stand
at
the
there
s
one
would
be
sorry
if
you
were
to
fall
said
the
hottentot
maid
leering
at
bonaparte
s
pipe
that
lay
on
the
table
hold
your
tongue
jade
said
her
mistress
trying
to
conceal
a
pleased
smile
and
go
and
fetch
the
there
was
a
at
one
end
of
the
sitting
room
this
the
hottentot
maid
pushed
open
and
setting
the
ladder
against
it
the
with
some
danger
and
difficulty
climbed
into
the
loft
then
the
hottentot
maid
took
the
ladder
away
as
her
husband
was
mending
the
and
needed
it
but
the
was
left
open
for
a
little
while
tant
sannie
poked
about
among
the
empty
bottles
and
skins
and
looked
at
the
bag
of
peaches
that
waldo
was
supposed
to
have
liked
so
then
she
sat
down
near
the
beside
a
barrel
of
salt
mutton
she
found
that
the
pieces
of
meat
were
much
too
large
and
took
out
her
to
divide
them
that
was
always
the
way
when
one
left
things
to
servants
she
grumbled
to
herself
but
when
once
she
was
married
to
her
husband
bonaparte
it
would
not
matter
whether
a
sheep
spoiled
or
no
when
once
his
rich
aunt
with
the
dropsy
was
dead
she
smiled
as
she
dived
her
hand
into
the
at
that
instant
her
niece
entered
the
room
below
closely
followed
by
bonaparte
with
his
head
on
one
side
smiling
mawkishly
had
tant
sannie
spoken
at
that
moment
the
life
of
bonaparte
blenkins
would
have
run
a
wholly
different
course
as
it
was
she
remained
silent
and
neither
noticed
the
open
above
their
heads
sit
there
my
love
said
bonaparte
motioning
trana
into
her
aunt
s
and
drawing
another
close
up
in
front
of
it
in
which
he
seated
himself
there
put
your
feet
upon
the
stove
too
your
aunt
has
gone
out
somewhere
long
have
i
waited
for
this
auspicious
event
trana
who
understood
not
one
word
of
english
sat
down
in
the
chair
and
wondered
if
this
was
one
of
the
strange
customs
of
other
lands
that
an
old
gentleman
may
bring
his
chair
up
to
yours
and
sit
with
his
knees
touching
you
she
had
been
five
days
in
bonaparte
s
company
and
feared
the
old
man
and
disliked
his
nose
how
long
have
i
desired
this
moment
said
bonaparte
but
that
aged
relative
of
thine
is
always
casting
her
unhallowed
shadow
upon
us
look
into
my
eyes
bonaparte
knew
that
she
comprehended
not
a
syllable
but
he
understood
that
it
is
the
eye
the
tone
the
action
and
not
at
all
the
rational
word
that
touches
the
he
saw
she
changed
colour
all
night
said
bonaparte
i
lie
awake
i
see
naught
but
thy
angelic
countenance
i
open
my
arms
to
receive
thee
where
art
thou
where
thou
art
not
there
said
bonaparte
suiting
the
action
to
the
words
and
spreading
out
his
arms
and
drawing
them
to
his
breast
oh
please
i
don
t
understand
said
trana
i
want
to
go
yes
yes
said
bonaparte
leaning
back
in
his
chair
to
her
great
relief
and
pressing
his
hands
on
his
heart
since
first
thy
amethystine
countenance
was
impressed
here
what
have
i
not
suffered
what
have
i
not
felt
oh
the
pangs
unspoken
burning
as
an
ardent
coal
in
a
fiery
and
uncontaminated
bosom
said
bonaparte
bending
forward
again
dear
lord
said
trana
to
herself
how
foolish
i
have
been
the
old
man
has
a
pain
in
his
stomach
and
now
as
my
aunt
is
out
he
has
come
to
me
to
help
she
smiled
kindly
at
bonaparte
and
pushing
past
him
went
to
the
bedroom
quickly
returning
with
a
bottle
of
red
drops
in
her
hand
they
are
very
good
for
benauwdheid
my
mother
always
drinks
them
she
said
holding
the
bottle
out
the
face
in
the
was
a
fiery
red
like
a
ready
to
spring
tant
sannie
crouched
with
the
shoulder
of
mutton
in
her
hand
exactly
beneath
her
stood
bonaparte
she
rose
and
clasped
with
both
arms
the
barrel
of
salt
meat
what
rose
of
the
desert
nightingale
of
the
colony
that
with
thine
amorous
lay
whilest
the
lonesome
night
cried
bonaparte
seizing
the
hand
that
held
the
vonlicsense
nay
struggle
not
fly
as
a
stricken
fawn
into
the
arms
that
would
embrace
thee
thou
here
a
stream
of
cold
heavy
with
ribs
and
shoulders
descending
on
his
head
abruptly
terminated
his
speech
bonaparte
looked
up
through
the
drops
that
hung
from
his
eyelids
and
saw
the
red
face
that
looked
down
at
him
with
one
wild
cry
he
fled
as
he
passed
out
at
the
front
door
a
shoulder
of
mutton
struck
the
black
coat
in
the
small
of
the
back
bring
the
ladder
bring
the
ladder
i
will
go
after
him
cried
the
as
bonaparte
blenkins
wildly
fled
into
the
fields
late
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
waldo
knelt
on
the
floor
of
his
cabin
he
bathed
the
foot
of
his
dog
which
had
been
pierced
by
a
thorn
the
bruises
on
his
own
back
had
had
five
days
to
heal
in
and
except
a
little
stiffness
in
his
movements
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
the
boy
the
troubles
of
the
young
are
soon
over
they
leave
no
external
mark
if
you
wound
the
tree
in
its
youth
the
bark
will
quickly
cover
the
gash
but
when
the
tree
is
very
old
peeling
the
bark
off
and
looking
carefully
you
will
see
the
scar
there
still
all
that
is
buried
is
not
dead
waldo
poured
the
warm
milk
over
the
little
swollen
foot
doss
lay
very
quiet
with
tears
in
his
eyes
then
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
in
an
instant
doss
looked
wide
awake
and
winked
the
tears
out
from
between
his
little
lids
come
in
said
waldo
intent
on
his
work
and
slowly
and
cautiously
the
door
opened
good
evening
waldo
my
boy
said
bonaparte
blenkins
in
a
mild
voice
not
venturing
more
than
his
nose
within
the
door
how
are
you
this
evening
doss
growled
and
showed
his
little
teeth
and
tried
to
rise
but
his
paw
hurt
him
so
he
whined
i
m
very
tired
waldo
my
boy
said
bonaparte
plaintively
doss
showed
his
little
white
teeth
again
his
master
went
on
with
his
work
without
looking
round
there
are
some
people
at
whose
hands
it
is
best
not
to
look
at
last
he
said
come
bonaparte
stepped
cautiously
a
little
way
into
the
room
and
left
the
door
open
behind
him
he
looked
at
the
boy
s
supper
on
the
table
waldo
i
ve
had
nothing
to
eat
all
day
i
m
very
hungry
he
said
eat
said
waldo
after
a
moment
bending
lower
over
his
dog
you
won
t
go
and
tell
her
that
i
am
here
will
you
waldo
said
bonaparte
most
uneasily
you
ve
heard
how
she
used
me
waldo
i
ve
been
badly
treated
you
ll
know
yourself
what
it
is
some
day
when
you
can
t
carry
on
a
little
conversation
with
a
lady
without
having
salt
meat
and
thrown
at
you
waldo
look
at
me
do
i
look
as
a
gentleman
should
but
the
boy
neither
looked
up
nor
answered
and
bonaparte
grew
more
uneasy
you
wouldn
t
go
and
tell
her
that
i
am
here
would
you
said
bonaparte
whiningly
there
s
no
knowing
what
she
would
do
to
me
i
ve
such
trust
in
you
waldo
i
ve
always
thought
you
such
a
promising
lad
though
you
mayn
t
have
known
it
eat
said
the
boy
i
shall
say
bonaparte
who
knew
the
truth
when
another
spoke
it
closed
the
door
carefully
putting
on
the
button
then
he
looked
to
see
that
the
curtain
of
the
window
was
closely
pulled
down
and
seated
himself
at
the
table
he
was
soon
munching
the
cold
meat
and
bread
waldo
knelt
on
the
floor
bathing
the
foot
with
hands
which
the
dog
licked
lovingly
once
only
he
glanced
at
the
table
and
turned
away
quickly
ah
yes
i
don
t
wonder
that
you
can
t
look
at
me
waldo
said
bonaparte
my
condition
would
touch
any
heart
you
see
the
water
was
fatty
and
that
has
made
all
the
sand
stick
to
me
and
my
hair
said
bonaparte
tenderly
touching
the
little
fringe
at
the
back
of
his
head
is
all
caked
over
like
a
little
plank
you
wouldn
t
think
it
was
hair
at
all
said
bonaparte
plaintively
i
had
to
creep
all
along
the
stone
walls
for
fear
she
d
see
me
and
with
nothing
on
my
head
but
a
red
handkerchief
tied
under
my
chin
waldo
and
to
hide
in
a
sloot
the
whole
day
with
not
a
mouthful
of
food
waldo
and
she
gave
me
such
a
blow
just
here
said
bonaparte
he
had
cleared
the
plate
of
the
last
morsel
when
waldo
rose
and
walked
to
the
door
oh
waldo
my
dear
boy
you
are
not
going
to
call
her
said
bonaparte
rising
anxiously
i
am
going
to
sleep
in
the
wagon
said
the
boy
opening
the
door
oh
we
can
both
sleep
in
this
bed
there
s
plenty
of
room
do
stay
my
boy
but
waldo
stepped
out
it
was
such
a
little
whip
waldo
said
bonaparte
following
him
deprecatingly
i
didn
t
think
it
would
hurt
you
so
much
it
was
such
a
little
whip
i
am
sure
you
didn
t
take
the
peaches
you
aren
t
going
to
call
her
waldo
are
you
but
the
boy
walked
off
bonaparte
waited
till
his
figure
had
passed
round
the
front
of
the
and
then
slipped
out
he
hid
himself
round
the
corner
but
kept
peeping
out
to
see
who
was
coming
he
felt
sure
the
boy
was
gone
to
call
tant
sannie
his
teeth
chattered
with
inward
cold
as
he
looked
round
into
the
darkness
and
thought
of
the
snakes
that
might
bite
him
and
the
dreadful
things
that
might
attack
him
and
the
dead
that
might
arise
out
of
their
graves
if
he
slept
out
in
the
field
all
night
but
more
than
an
hour
passed
and
no
footstep
approached
then
bonaparte
made
his
way
back
to
the
cabin
he
buttoned
the
door
and
put
the
table
against
it
and
giving
the
dog
a
kick
to
silence
his
whining
when
the
foot
throbbed
he
climbed
into
bed
he
did
not
put
out
the
light
for
fear
of
the
ghost
but
worn
out
with
the
sorrows
of
the
day
was
soon
asleep
himself
about
four
o
clock
waldo
lying
between
the
seats
of
the
was
awakened
by
a
gentle
touch
on
his
head
sitting
up
he
espied
bonaparte
looking
through
one
of
the
windows
with
a
lighted
candle
in
his
hand
i
m
about
to
depart
my
dear
boy
before
my
enemies
arise
and
i
could
not
leave
without
coming
to
bid
you
farewell
said
bonaparte
waldo
looked
at
him
i
shall
always
think
of
you
with
affection
said
bonaparte
and
there
s
that
old
hat
of
yours
if
you
could
let
me
have
it
for
a
keepsake
take
it
said
waldo
i
thought
you
would
say
so
so
i
brought
it
with
me
said
bonaparte
putting
it
on
the
lord
bless
you
my
dear
boy
you
haven
t
a
few
shillings
just
a
trifle
you
don
t
need
have
you
take
the
two
shillings
that
are
in
the
broken
may
the
blessing
of
my
god
rest
upon
you
my
dear
child
said
bonaparte
may
he
guide
and
bless
you
give
me
your
waldo
folded
his
arms
closely
and
lay
down
farewell
adieu
said
bonaparte
may
the
blessing
of
my
god
and
my
father
s
god
rest
on
you
now
and
with
these
words
the
head
and
nose
withdrew
themselves
and
the
light
vanished
from
the
window
after
a
few
moments
the
boy
lying
in
the
wagon
heard
stealthy
footsteps
as
they
passed
the
and
made
their
way
down
the
road
he
listened
as
they
grew
fainter
and
fainter
and
at
last
died
away
altogether
and
from
that
night
the
footstep
of
bonaparte
blenkins
was
heard
no
more
at
the
old
farm
end
of
part
i
part
ii
and
it
was
all
play
and
no
one
could
tell
what
it
had
lived
and
worked
for
a
striving
and
a
striving
and
an
ending
in
chapter
times
and
seasons
waldo
lay
on
his
stomach
on
the
sand
since
he
prayed
and
howled
to
his
god
in
the
three
years
had
passed
they
say
that
in
the
world
to
come
time
is
not
measured
out
by
months
and
years
neither
is
it
here
the
soul
s
life
has
seasons
of
its
own
periods
not
found
in
any
calendar
times
that
years
and
months
will
not
scan
but
which
are
as
deftly
and
sharply
cut
off
from
one
another
as
the
years
which
the
earth
s
motion
yields
us
to
stranger
eyes
these
divisions
are
not
evident
but
each
looking
back
at
the
little
track
his
consciousness
illuminates
sees
it
cut
into
distinct
portions
whose
boundaries
are
the
termination
of
mental
states
as
man
differs
from
man
so
differ
these
souls
years
the
most
material
life
is
not
devoid
of
them
the
story
of
the
most
spiritual
is
told
in
them
and
it
may
chance
that
some
looking
back
see
the
past
cut
out
after
this
fashion
i
the
year
of
infancy
where
from
the
shadowy
background
of
forgetfulness
start
out
pictures
of
startling
clearness
disconnected
but
brightly
coloured
and
indelibly
printed
in
the
mind
much
that
follows
fades
but
the
colours
of
those
are
permanent
there
rises
perhaps
a
warm
summer
s
evening
we
are
seated
on
the
doorstep
we
have
yet
the
taste
of
the
bread
and
milk
in
our
mouth
and
the
red
sunset
is
reflected
in
our
basin
then
there
is
a
dark
night
where
waking
with
a
fear
that
there
is
some
great
being
in
the
room
we
run
from
our
own
bed
to
another
creep
close
to
some
large
figure
and
are
comforted
then
there
is
remembrance
of
the
pride
when
on
some
one
s
shoulder
with
our
arms
around
their
head
we
ride
to
see
the
little
pigs
the
new
little
pigs
with
their
curled
tails
and
tiny
snouts
where
do
they
come
from
remembrance
of
delight
in
the
feel
and
smell
of
the
first
orange
we
ever
see
of
sorrow
which
makes
us
put
up
our
lip
and
cry
hard
when
one
morning
we
run
out
to
try
and
catch
the
dewdrops
and
they
melt
and
wet
our
little
fingers
of
almighty
and
despairing
sorrow
when
we
are
lost
behind
the
kraals
and
can
not
see
the
house
anywhere
and
then
one
picture
starts
out
more
vividly
than
any
there
has
been
a
thunderstorm
the
ground
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
is
covered
with
white
hail
the
clouds
are
gone
and
overhead
a
deep
blue
sky
is
showing
far
off
a
great
rainbow
rests
on
the
white
earth
we
standing
in
a
window
to
look
feel
the
cool
unspeakably
sweet
wind
blowing
in
on
us
and
a
feeling
of
longing
comes
over
us
unutterable
longing
we
can
not
tell
for
what
we
are
so
small
our
head
only
reaches
as
high
as
the
first
three
panes
we
look
at
the
white
earth
and
the
rainbow
and
the
blue
sky
and
oh
we
want
it
we
want
we
do
not
know
what
we
cry
as
though
our
heart
was
broken
when
one
lifts
our
little
body
from
the
window
we
can
not
tell
what
ails
us
we
run
away
to
play
so
looks
the
first
year
ii
now
the
pictures
become
continuous
and
connected
material
things
still
rule
but
the
spiritual
and
intellectual
take
their
places
in
the
dark
night
when
we
are
afraid
we
pray
and
shut
our
eyes
we
press
our
fingers
very
hard
upon
the
lids
and
see
dark
spots
moving
round
and
round
and
we
know
they
are
heads
and
wings
of
angels
sent
to
take
care
of
us
seen
dimly
in
the
dark
as
they
move
round
our
bed
it
is
very
consoling
in
the
day
we
learn
our
letters
and
are
troubled
because
we
can
not
see
why
should
be
know
and
psalm
they
tell
us
it
is
so
because
it
is
so
we
are
not
satisfied
we
hate
to
learn
we
like
better
to
build
little
stone
houses
we
can
build
them
as
we
please
and
know
the
reason
for
them
other
joys
too
we
have
incomparably
greater
then
even
the
building
of
stone
houses
we
are
run
through
with
a
shudder
of
delight
when
in
the
red
sand
we
come
on
one
of
those
white
wax
flowers
that
lie
between
their
two
green
leaves
flat
on
the
sand
we
hardly
dare
pick
them
but
we
feel
compelled
to
do
so
and
we
smell
and
smell
till
the
delight
becomes
almost
pain
afterward
we
pull
the
green
leaves
softly
into
pieces
to
see
the
silk
threads
run
across
beyond
the
kopje
grow
some
bushes
we
are
so
small
they
meet
over
our
head
and
we
sit
among
them
and
kiss
them
and
they
love
us
back
it
seems
as
though
they
were
alive
one
day
we
sit
there
and
look
up
at
the
blue
sky
and
down
at
our
fat
little
knees
and
suddenly
it
strikes
us
who
are
we
this
i
what
is
it
we
try
to
look
in
upon
ourselves
and
ourself
beats
back
upon
ourself
then
we
get
up
in
great
fear
and
run
home
as
hard
as
we
can
we
can
t
tell
any
one
what
frightened
us
we
never
quite
lose
that
feeling
of
self
again
iii
and
then
a
new
time
rises
we
are
seven
years
old
we
can
read
now
read
the
bible
best
of
all
we
like
the
story
of
elijah
in
his
cave
at
horeb
and
the
still
small
voice
one
day
a
notable
one
we
read
on
the
kopje
and
discover
the
fifth
chapter
of
matthew
and
read
it
all
through
it
is
a
new
then
we
tuck
the
bible
under
our
arm
and
rushed
home
they
didn
t
know
it
was
wicked
to
take
your
things
again
if
some
one
took
them
wicked
to
go
to
law
wicked
to
we
are
quite
breathless
when
we
get
to
the
house
we
tell
them
we
have
discovered
a
chapter
they
never
heard
of
we
tell
them
what
it
says
the
old
wise
people
tell
us
they
knew
all
about
it
our
discovery
is
a
mare
to
them
but
to
us
it
is
very
real
the
ten
commandments
and
the
old
thou
shalt
we
have
heard
about
long
enough
and
don
t
care
about
it
but
this
new
law
sets
us
on
fire
we
will
deny
ourself
our
little
wagon
that
we
have
made
we
give
to
the
little
kaffers
we
keep
quiet
when
they
throw
sand
at
us
feeling
oh
so
happy
we
conscientiously
put
the
cracked
teacup
for
ourselves
at
breakfast
and
take
the
burnt
we
save
our
money
and
buy
threepence
of
tobacco
for
the
hottentot
maid
who
calls
us
names
we
are
exotically
virtuous
at
night
we
are
profoundly
religious
even
the
ticking
watch
says
eternity
eternity
hell
hell
hell
and
the
silence
talks
of
god
and
the
things
that
shall
be
occasionally
also
unpleasantly
shrewd
questions
begin
to
be
asked
by
some
one
we
know
not
who
who
sits
somewhere
behind
our
shoulder
we
get
to
know
him
better
afterward
now
we
carry
the
questions
to
the
people
and
they
give
us
answers
we
are
more
or
less
satisfied
for
the
time
the
people
are
very
wise
and
they
say
it
was
kind
of
god
to
make
hell
and
very
loving
of
him
to
send
men
there
and
besides
he
couldn
t
help
himself
and
they
are
very
wise
we
think
so
we
believe
them
more
or
less
iv
then
a
new
time
comes
of
which
the
leading
feature
is
that
the
shrewd
questions
are
asked
louder
we
carry
them
to
the
people
they
answer
us
and
we
are
not
satisfied
and
now
between
us
and
the
dear
old
world
of
the
senses
the
begins
to
peep
in
and
wholly
clouds
it
over
what
are
the
flowers
to
us
they
are
fuel
waiting
for
the
great
burning
we
look
at
the
walls
of
the
farmhouse
and
the
with
the
merry
sunshine
playing
over
all
and
do
not
see
it
but
we
see
a
great
white
throne
and
him
that
sits
on
it
around
him
stand
a
great
multitude
that
no
man
can
number
harpers
harping
with
their
harps
a
thousand
times
ten
thousand
and
thousands
of
thousands
how
white
are
their
robes
washed
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
and
the
music
rises
higher
and
rends
the
vault
of
heaven
with
its
unutterable
sweetness
and
we
as
we
listen
ever
and
anon
as
it
sinks
on
the
sweetest
lowest
note
hear
a
groan
of
the
damned
from
below
we
shudder
in
the
sunlight
the
torment
says
jeremy
taylor
whose
sermons
our
father
reads
aloud
in
the
evening
comprises
as
many
torments
as
the
body
of
man
has
joints
sinews
arteries
being
caused
by
that
penetrating
and
real
fire
of
which
this
temporal
fire
is
but
a
painted
fire
what
comparison
will
there
be
between
burning
for
a
hundred
years
space
and
to
be
burning
without
intermission
as
long
as
god
is
god
we
remember
the
sermon
there
in
the
sunlight
one
comes
and
asks
why
we
sit
there
nodding
so
moodily
ah
they
do
not
see
what
we
see
a
moment
s
time
a
narrow
space
divides
me
from
that
heavenly
place
or
shuts
me
up
in
so
says
wesley
s
hymn
which
we
sing
evening
by
evening
what
matter
sunshine
and
walls
men
and
sheep
the
things
which
are
seen
are
temporal
but
the
things
which
are
not
seen
are
they
are
real
the
bible
we
bear
always
in
our
breast
its
pages
are
our
food
we
learn
to
repeat
it
we
weep
much
for
in
sunshine
and
in
shade
in
the
early
morning
or
the
late
evening
in
the
field
or
in
the
house
the
devil
walks
with
us
he
comes
to
a
real
person
face
head
a
little
on
one
side
forehead
knit
asking
questions
believe
me
it
were
better
to
be
followed
by
three
deadly
diseases
than
by
him
he
is
never
silenced
without
mercy
though
the
drops
of
blood
stand
out
on
your
heart
he
will
put
his
question
softly
he
comes
up
we
are
only
a
wee
bit
child
is
it
good
of
god
to
make
hell
was
it
kind
of
him
to
let
no
one
be
forgiven
unless
jesus
christ
died
then
he
goes
off
and
leaves
us
writhing
presently
he
comes
back
do
you
love
him
waits
a
little
do
you
love
him
you
will
be
lost
if
you
don
we
say
we
try
to
but
do
you
then
he
goes
off
it
is
nothing
to
him
if
we
go
quite
mad
with
fear
at
our
own
wickedness
he
asks
on
the
questioning
devil
he
cares
nothing
what
he
says
we
long
to
tell
some
one
that
they
may
share
our
pain
we
do
not
yet
know
that
the
cup
of
affliction
is
made
with
such
a
narrow
mouth
that
only
one
lip
can
drink
at
a
time
and
that
each
man
s
cup
is
made
to
match
his
lip
one
day
we
try
to
tell
some
one
then
a
grave
head
is
shaken
solemnly
at
us
we
are
wicked
very
wicked
they
say
we
ought
not
to
have
such
thoughts
god
is
good
very
good
we
are
wicked
very
wicked
that
is
the
comfort
we
get
wicked
oh
lord
do
we
not
know
it
is
it
not
the
sense
of
our
own
exceeding
wickedness
that
is
drying
up
our
young
heart
filling
it
with
sand
making
all
life
a
for
us
wicked
we
know
it
too
vile
to
live
too
vile
to
die
too
vile
to
creep
over
this
god
s
earth
and
move
among
his
believing
men
hell
is
the
one
place
for
him
who
hates
his
master
and
there
we
do
not
want
to
go
this
is
the
comfort
we
get
from
the
old
and
once
again
we
try
to
seek
for
comfort
this
time
great
eyes
look
at
us
wondering
and
lovely
little
lips
say
if
it
makes
you
so
unhappy
to
think
of
these
things
why
do
you
not
think
of
something
else
and
forget
forget
we
turn
away
and
shrink
into
ourself
forget
and
think
of
other
things
oh
god
do
they
not
understand
that
the
material
world
is
but
a
film
through
every
pore
of
which
god
s
awful
spirit
world
is
shining
through
on
us
we
keep
as
far
from
others
as
we
can
one
night
a
rare
clear
moonlight
night
we
kneel
in
the
window
every
one
else
is
asleep
but
we
kneel
reading
by
the
moonlight
it
is
a
chapter
in
the
prophets
telling
how
the
chosen
people
of
god
shall
be
carried
on
the
gentiles
shoulders
surely
the
devil
might
leave
us
alone
there
is
not
much
to
handle
for
him
there
but
presently
he
comes
is
it
right
there
should
be
a
chosen
people
to
him
who
is
father
to
all
should
not
all
be
dear
how
can
we
answer
him
we
were
feeling
so
good
till
he
came
we
put
our
head
down
on
the
bible
and
blister
it
with
tears
then
we
fold
our
hands
over
our
head
and
pray
till
our
teeth
grind
together
oh
that
from
that
so
real
and
yet
so
silent
that
surrounds
us
one
word
would
come
to
guide
us
we
are
left
alone
with
this
devil
and
god
does
not
whisper
to
us
suddenly
we
seize
the
bible
turning
it
round
and
round
and
say
hurriedly
it
will
be
god
s
voice
speaking
to
us
his
voice
as
though
we
heard
we
yearn
for
a
token
from
the
inexorably
silent
one
we
turn
the
book
put
our
finger
down
on
a
page
and
bend
to
read
by
the
moonlight
it
is
god
s
answer
we
tremble
then
fourteen
years
after
i
went
up
again
to
jerusalem
with
barnabas
and
took
titus
with
me
for
an
instant
our
imagination
seizes
it
we
are
twisting
twirling
trying
to
make
an
allegory
the
fourteen
years
are
fourteen
months
we
are
paul
and
the
devil
is
barnabas
titus
is
then
a
sudden
loathing
comes
to
us
we
are
liars
and
hypocrites
we
are
trying
to
deceive
ourselves
what
is
paul
to
us
and
jerusalem
we
are
barnabas
and
titus
we
know
not
the
men
before
we
know
we
seize
the
book
swing
it
round
our
head
and
fling
it
with
all
our
might
to
the
further
end
of
the
room
we
put
down
our
head
again
and
weep
youth
and
ignorance
is
there
anything
else
that
can
weep
so
it
is
as
though
the
tears
were
drops
of
blood
congealed
beneath
the
eyelids
nothing
else
is
like
those
tears
after
a
long
time
we
are
weak
with
crying
and
lie
silent
and
by
chance
we
knock
against
the
wood
that
stops
the
broken
pane
it
falls
upon
our
hot
stiff
face
a
sweet
breath
of
wind
blows
we
raise
our
head
and
with
our
swollen
eyes
look
out
at
the
beautiful
still
world
and
the
sweet
blows
in
upon
us
holy
and
gentle
like
a
loving
breath
from
the
lips
of
god
over
us
a
deep
peace
comes
a
calm
still
joy
the
tears
now
flow
readily
and
softly
oh
the
unutterable
gladness
at
last
at
last
we
have
found
it
the
peace
with
the
sense
of
sins
all
doubt
vanished
god
s
voice
in
the
soul
the
holy
spirit
filling
us
we
feel
him
we
feel
him
oh
jesus
christ
through
you
through
you
this
joy
we
press
our
hands
upon
our
breast
and
look
upward
with
adoring
gladness
soft
waves
of
bliss
break
through
us
the
peace
with
the
sense
of
sins
methodists
and
revivalists
say
the
words
and
the
mocking
world
shoots
out
its
lip
and
walks
by
smiling
there
are
more
fools
and
fewer
hypocrites
than
the
wise
world
dreams
of
the
hypocrite
is
rare
as
icebergs
in
the
tropics
the
fool
common
as
buttercups
beside
a
whether
you
go
this
way
or
that
you
tread
on
him
you
dare
not
look
at
your
own
reflection
in
the
water
but
you
see
one
there
is
no
cant
phrase
rotten
with
age
but
it
was
the
dress
of
a
living
body
none
but
at
heart
it
signifies
a
real
bodily
or
mental
condition
which
some
have
passed
through
after
hours
and
nights
of
frenzied
fear
of
the
supernatural
desire
to
appease
the
power
above
a
fierce
quivering
excitement
in
every
inch
of
nerve
and
blood
vessel
there
comes
a
time
when
nature
can
not
endure
longer
and
the
spring
long
bent
recoils
we
sink
down
emasculated
up
creeps
the
deadly
delicious
calm
i
have
blotted
out
as
a
cloud
thy
sins
and
as
a
thick
cloud
thy
trespasses
and
will
remember
them
no
more
for
we
weep
with
soft
transporting
joy
a
few
experience
this
many
imagine
they
experience
it
one
here
and
there
lies
about
it
in
the
main
the
peace
with
god
a
sense
of
sins
forgiven
stands
for
a
certain
mental
and
physical
reaction
its
reality
those
know
who
have
felt
it
and
we
on
that
moonlight
night
put
down
our
head
on
the
window
oh
god
we
are
happy
happy
thy
child
forever
oh
thank
you
god
and
we
drop
asleep
next
morning
the
bible
we
kiss
we
are
god
s
forever
we
go
out
to
work
and
it
goes
happily
all
day
happily
all
night
but
hardly
so
happily
not
happily
at
all
the
next
day
and
the
next
night
the
devil
asks
us
where
is
your
holy
spirit
we
can
not
tell
so
month
by
month
summer
and
winter
the
old
life
goes
on
reading
praying
weeping
praying
they
tell
us
we
become
utterly
stupid
we
know
it
even
the
multiplication
table
we
learnt
with
so
much
care
we
forgot
the
physical
world
recedes
further
and
further
from
us
truly
we
love
not
the
world
neither
the
things
that
are
in
it
across
the
bounds
of
sleep
our
grief
follows
us
when
we
wake
in
the
night
we
are
sitting
up
in
bed
weeping
bitterly
or
find
ourself
outside
in
the
moonlight
dressed
and
walking
up
and
down
and
wringing
our
hands
and
we
can
not
tell
how
we
came
there
so
pass
two
years
as
men
reckon
them
then
a
new
time
before
us
there
were
three
courses
possible
to
go
mad
to
die
to
sleep
we
take
the
latter
course
or
nature
takes
it
for
us
all
things
take
rest
in
sleep
the
beasts
birds
the
very
flowers
close
their
eyes
and
the
streams
are
still
in
winter
all
things
take
rest
then
why
not
the
human
reason
also
so
the
questioning
devil
in
us
drops
asleep
and
in
that
sleep
a
beautiful
dream
rises
for
us
though
you
hear
all
the
dreams
of
men
you
will
hardly
find
a
prettier
one
than
ours
it
ran
so
in
the
centre
of
all
things
is
a
mighty
heart
which
having
begotten
all
things
loves
them
and
having
born
them
into
life
beats
with
great
throbs
of
love
towards
them
no
death
for
his
dear
insects
no
hell
for
his
dear
men
no
burning
up
for
his
dear
world
his
own
own
world
that
he
has
made
in
the
end
all
will
be
beautiful
do
not
ask
us
how
we
make
our
dream
tally
with
facts
the
glory
of
a
dream
is
this
that
it
despises
facts
and
makes
its
own
our
dream
saves
us
from
going
mad
that
is
enough
its
peculiar
point
of
sweetness
lay
here
when
the
mighty
heart
s
yearning
of
love
became
too
great
for
other
expression
it
shaped
itself
into
the
sweet
rose
of
heaven
the
beloved
jesus
you
jesus
of
our
dream
how
we
loved
you
no
bible
tells
of
you
as
we
knew
you
your
sweet
hands
held
ours
fast
your
sweet
voice
said
always
i
am
here
my
loved
one
not
far
off
put
your
arms
about
me
and
hold
we
find
him
in
everything
in
those
days
when
the
little
weary
lamb
we
drive
home
drags
its
feet
we
seize
on
it
and
carry
it
with
its
head
against
our
face
his
little
lamb
we
feel
we
have
got
him
when
the
drunken
kaffer
lies
by
the
road
in
the
sun
we
draw
his
blanket
over
his
head
and
put
green
branches
of
on
it
his
kaffer
why
should
the
sun
hurt
him
in
the
evening
when
the
clouds
lift
themselves
like
gates
and
the
red
lights
shine
through
them
we
cry
for
in
such
glory
he
will
come
and
the
hands
that
ache
to
touch
him
will
hold
him
and
we
shall
see
the
beautiful
hair
and
eyes
of
our
god
lift
up
your
heads
o
ye
gates
and
be
ye
lifted
up
ye
everlasting
doors
and
our
king
of
glory
shall
come
in
the
purple
flowers
the
little
purple
flowers
are
his
eyes
looking
at
us
we
kiss
them
and
kneel
alone
on
the
flat
rejoicing
over
them
and
the
wilderness
and
the
solitary
place
shall
be
glad
for
him
and
the
desert
shall
rejoice
and
blossom
as
a
rose
if
ever
in
our
tearful
joyful
ecstasy
the
poor
sleepy
devil
should
raise
his
head
we
laugh
at
him
it
is
not
his
hour
now
if
there
should
be
a
hell
after
all
he
mutters
if
your
god
should
be
cruel
if
there
should
be
no
god
if
you
should
find
out
it
is
all
imagination
if
we
laugh
at
him
when
a
man
sits
in
the
warm
sunshine
do
you
ask
him
for
proof
of
it
he
feels
that
is
all
and
we
feel
that
is
all
we
want
no
proof
of
our
god
we
feel
we
feel
we
do
not
believe
in
our
god
because
the
bible
tells
us
of
him
we
believe
in
the
bible
because
he
tells
us
of
it
we
feel
him
we
feel
him
we
feel
that
is
all
and
the
poor
devil
mutters
but
if
the
day
should
come
when
you
do
not
feel
and
we
laugh
and
cry
him
down
it
will
never
come
never
and
the
poor
devil
slinks
to
sleep
again
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
fierce
assertion
many
times
repeated
is
hard
to
stand
against
only
time
separates
the
truth
from
the
lie
so
we
dream
on
one
day
we
go
with
our
father
to
town
to
church
the
townspeople
rustle
in
their
silks
and
the
men
in
their
sleek
cloth
and
settle
themselves
in
their
pews
and
the
light
shines
in
through
the
windows
on
the
artificial
flowers
in
the
women
s
bonnets
we
have
the
same
miserable
feeling
that
we
have
in
a
shop
where
all
the
clerks
are
very
smart
we
wish
our
father
hadn
t
brought
us
to
town
and
we
were
out
on
the
karoo
then
the
man
in
the
pulpit
begins
to
preach
his
text
is
he
that
believeth
not
shall
be
the
day
before
the
magistrate
s
clerk
who
was
an
atheist
has
died
in
the
street
struck
by
lightning
the
man
in
the
pulpit
mentions
no
name
but
he
talks
of
the
hand
of
god
made
visible
amongst
he
tells
us
how
when
the
white
stroke
fell
quivering
and
naked
the
soul
fled
robbed
of
his
earthly
filament
and
lay
at
the
footstool
of
god
how
over
its
head
has
been
poured
out
the
wrath
of
the
mighty
one
whose
existence
it
has
denied
and
quivering
and
terrified
it
has
fled
to
the
everlasting
shade
we
as
we
listen
half
start
up
every
drop
of
blood
in
our
body
has
rushed
to
our
head
he
lies
he
lies
he
lies
that
man
in
the
pulpit
lies
will
no
one
stop
him
have
none
of
them
heard
do
none
of
them
know
that
when
the
poor
dark
soul
shut
its
eyes
on
earth
it
opened
them
in
the
still
light
of
heaven
that
there
is
no
wrath
where
god
s
face
is
that
if
one
could
once
creep
to
the
footstool
of
god
there
is
everlasting
peace
there
like
the
fresh
stillness
of
the
early
morning
while
the
atheist
lay
wondering
and
afraid
god
bent
down
and
said
my
child
here
i
am
i
whom
you
have
not
known
i
whom
you
have
not
believed
in
i
am
here
i
sent
my
messenger
the
white
to
call
you
home
i
am
then
the
poor
soul
turned
to
the
light
its
weakness
and
pain
were
gone
forever
have
they
not
known
have
they
not
heard
who
it
is
rules
for
a
little
moment
have
i
hidden
my
face
from
thee
but
with
everlasting
kindness
will
i
have
mercy
upon
thee
saith
the
lord
thy
we
mutter
on
to
ourselves
till
some
one
pulls
us
violently
by
the
arm
to
remind
us
we
are
in
church
we
see
nothing
but
our
own
ideas
presently
every
one
turns
to
pray
there
are
six
hundred
souls
lifting
themselves
to
the
everlasting
light
behind
us
sit
two
pretty
ladies
one
hands
her
softly
to
the
other
and
a
mother
pulls
down
her
little
girl
s
frock
one
lady
drops
her
handkerchief
a
gentleman
picks
it
up
she
blushes
the
women
in
the
choir
turn
softly
the
leaves
of
their
to
be
ready
when
the
praying
is
done
it
is
as
though
they
thought
more
of
the
singing
than
the
everlasting
father
oh
would
it
not
be
more
worship
of
him
to
sit
alone
in
the
karoo
and
kiss
one
little
purple
flower
that
he
had
made
is
it
not
mockery
then
the
thought
comes
what
doest
thou
here
elijah
we
who
judge
what
are
we
better
than
they
rather
worse
is
it
any
excuse
to
say
i
am
but
a
child
and
must
come
does
god
allow
any
soul
to
step
in
between
the
spirit
he
made
and
himself
what
do
we
there
in
that
place
where
all
the
words
are
lies
against
the
all
father
filled
with
horror
we
turn
and
flee
out
of
the
place
on
the
pavement
we
smite
our
foot
and
swear
in
our
child
s
soul
never
again
to
enter
those
places
where
men
come
to
sing
and
pray
we
are
questioned
afterward
why
was
it
we
went
out
of
the
church
how
can
we
explain
we
stand
silent
then
we
are
pressed
further
and
we
try
to
tell
then
a
head
is
shaken
solemnly
at
us
no
one
can
think
it
wrong
to
go
to
the
house
of
the
lord
it
is
the
idle
excuse
of
a
wicked
boy
when
will
we
think
seriously
of
our
souls
and
love
going
to
church
we
are
wicked
very
wicked
and
we
we
slink
away
and
go
alone
to
cry
will
it
be
always
so
whether
we
hate
and
doubt
or
whether
we
believe
and
love
to
our
dearest
are
we
to
seem
always
wicked
we
do
not
yet
know
that
in
the
soul
s
search
for
truth
the
bitterness
lies
here
the
striving
can
not
always
hide
itself
among
the
thoughts
sooner
or
later
it
will
clothe
itself
in
outward
action
then
it
steps
in
and
divides
between
the
soul
and
what
it
loves
all
things
on
earth
have
their
price
and
for
truth
we
pay
the
dearest
we
barter
it
for
love
and
sympathy
the
road
to
honour
is
paved
with
thorns
but
on
the
path
to
truth
at
every
step
you
set
your
foot
down
on
your
own
heart
vi
then
at
last
a
new
time
the
time
of
waking
short
sharp
and
not
pleasant
as
wakings
often
are
sleep
and
dreams
exist
on
this
condition
that
no
one
wake
the
dreamer
and
now
life
takes
us
up
between
her
finger
and
thumb
shakes
us
furiously
till
our
poor
nodding
head
is
rolled
from
our
shoulders
and
she
sets
us
down
a
little
hard
on
the
bare
earth
bruised
and
sore
but
preternaturally
wide
awake
we
have
said
in
our
days
of
dreaming
injustice
and
wrong
are
a
seeming
pain
is
a
shadow
our
god
he
is
real
he
who
made
all
things
and
he
only
is
now
life
takes
us
by
the
neck
and
shows
us
a
few
other
things
graves
with
the
red
sand
flying
about
them
eyes
that
we
love
with
the
worms
eating
them
evil
men
walking
sleek
and
fat
the
whole
terrible
of
the
thing
called
life
and
she
says
what
do
you
think
of
these
we
dare
not
say
we
feel
them
they
are
very
real
but
we
try
to
lay
our
hands
about
and
feel
that
other
thing
we
felt
before
in
the
dark
night
in
the
we
cry
to
our
beautiful
oh
let
us
come
near
you
and
lay
our
head
against
your
feet
now
in
our
hour
of
need
be
near
but
he
is
not
there
he
is
gone
away
the
old
questioning
devil
is
there
we
must
have
been
awakened
sooner
or
later
the
imagination
can
not
always
triumph
over
reality
the
desire
over
truth
we
must
have
been
awakened
if
it
was
done
a
little
sharply
what
matter
it
was
done
thoroughly
and
it
had
to
be
done
vii
and
a
new
life
begins
for
us
a
new
time
a
life
as
cold
as
that
of
a
man
who
sits
on
the
pinnacle
of
an
iceberg
and
sees
the
glittering
crystals
all
about
him
the
old
looks
indeed
like
a
long
hot
delirium
peopled
with
phantasies
the
new
is
cold
enough
now
we
have
no
god
we
have
had
two
the
old
god
that
our
fathers
handed
down
to
us
that
we
hated
and
never
liked
the
new
one
that
we
made
for
ourselves
that
we
loved
but
now
he
has
flitted
away
from
us
and
we
see
what
he
was
made
of
the
shadow
of
our
highest
ideal
crowned
and
throned
now
we
have
no
god
the
fool
hath
said
in
his
heart
there
is
no
it
may
be
so
most
things
said
or
written
have
been
the
work
of
fools
this
thing
is
certain
he
is
a
fool
who
says
no
man
hath
said
in
his
heart
there
is
no
it
has
been
said
many
thousand
times
in
hearts
with
profound
bitterness
of
earnest
faith
we
do
not
cry
and
weep
we
sit
down
with
cold
eyes
and
look
at
the
world
we
are
not
miserable
why
should
we
be
we
eat
and
drink
and
sleep
all
night
but
the
dead
are
not
colder
and
we
say
it
slowly
but
without
sighing
yes
we
see
it
now
there
is
no
and
we
add
growing
a
little
colder
yet
there
is
no
justice
the
ox
dies
in
the
yoke
beneath
its
master
s
whip
it
turns
its
eyes
on
the
sunlight
but
there
is
no
sign
of
recompense
to
be
made
it
the
black
man
is
shot
like
a
dog
and
it
goes
well
with
the
shooter
the
innocent
are
accused
and
the
accuser
triumphs
if
you
will
take
the
trouble
to
scratch
the
surface
anywhere
you
will
see
under
the
skin
a
sentient
being
writhing
in
impotent
and
we
say
further
and
our
heart
is
as
the
heart
of
the
dead
for
coldness
there
is
no
order
all
things
are
driven
about
by
a
blind
what
a
soul
drinks
in
with
its
mother
s
milk
will
not
leave
it
in
a
day
from
our
earliest
hour
we
have
been
taught
that
the
thought
of
the
heart
the
shaping
of
the
the
amount
of
wool
that
grows
on
a
sheep
s
back
the
length
of
a
drought
and
the
growing
of
the
corn
depend
on
nothing
that
moves
immutable
at
the
heart
of
all
things
but
on
the
changeable
will
of
a
changeable
being
whom
our
prayers
can
alter
to
us
from
the
beginning
nature
has
been
but
a
poor
plastic
thing
to
be
toyed
with
this
way
or
that
as
man
happens
to
please
his
deity
or
not
to
go
to
church
or
not
to
say
his
prayers
right
or
not
to
travel
on
a
sunday
or
not
was
it
possible
for
us
in
an
instant
to
see
nature
as
she
is
the
flowing
vestment
of
an
unchanging
reality
when
the
soul
breaks
free
from
the
arms
of
a
superstition
bits
of
the
claws
and
talons
break
themselves
off
in
him
it
is
not
the
work
of
a
day
to
squeeze
them
out
and
so
for
us
the
driver
and
guide
being
gone
all
existence
as
we
look
out
at
it
with
our
chilled
wondering
eyes
is
an
aimless
rise
and
swell
of
shifting
waters
in
all
that
weltering
chaos
we
can
see
no
spot
so
large
as
a
man
s
hand
on
which
we
may
plant
our
foot
whether
a
man
believes
in
a
god
or
no
is
a
small
thing
whether
he
looks
into
the
mental
and
physical
world
and
sees
no
relation
between
cause
and
effect
no
order
but
a
blind
chance
sporting
this
is
the
mightiest
fact
that
can
be
recorded
in
any
spiritual
existence
it
were
almost
a
mercy
to
cut
his
throat
if
indeed
he
does
not
do
it
for
himself
we
however
do
not
cut
our
throats
to
do
so
would
imply
some
desire
and
feeling
and
we
have
no
desire
and
no
feeling
we
are
only
cold
we
do
not
wish
to
live
and
we
do
not
wish
to
die
one
day
a
snake
curls
itself
round
the
waist
of
a
kaffer
woman
we
take
it
in
our
hand
swing
it
round
and
round
and
fling
it
on
the
ground
dead
every
one
looks
at
us
with
eyes
of
admiration
we
almost
laugh
is
it
wonderful
to
risk
that
for
which
we
care
nothing
in
truth
nothing
matters
this
dirty
little
world
full
of
confusion
and
the
blue
rag
stretched
overhead
for
a
sky
is
so
low
we
could
touch
it
with
our
hand
existence
is
a
great
pot
and
the
old
fate
who
stirs
it
round
cares
nothing
what
rises
to
the
top
and
what
goes
down
and
laughs
when
the
bubbles
burst
and
we
do
not
care
let
it
boil
about
why
should
we
trouble
ourselves
nevertheless
the
physical
sensations
are
real
hunger
hurts
and
thirst
therefore
we
eat
and
drink
inaction
pains
us
therefore
we
work
like
no
one
demands
it
but
we
set
ourselves
to
build
a
great
dam
in
red
sand
beyond
the
graves
in
the
grey
dawn
before
the
sheep
are
let
out
we
work
at
it
all
day
while
the
young
ostriches
we
tend
feed
about
us
we
work
on
through
the
fiercest
heat
the
people
wonder
what
new
spirit
has
seized
us
now
they
do
not
know
we
are
working
for
life
we
bear
the
greatest
stones
and
feel
a
satisfaction
when
we
stagger
under
them
and
are
hurt
by
a
pang
that
shoots
through
our
chest
while
we
eat
our
dinner
we
carry
on
baskets
full
of
earth
as
though
the
devil
drove
us
the
kaffer
servants
have
a
story
that
at
night
a
witch
and
two
white
oxen
come
to
help
us
no
wall
they
say
could
grow
so
quickly
under
one
man
s
hands
at
night
alone
in
our
cabin
we
sit
no
more
brooding
over
the
fire
what
should
we
think
of
now
all
is
emptiness
so
we
take
the
old
arithmetic
and
the
multiplication
table
which
with
so
much
pains
we
learnt
long
ago
and
forgot
directly
we
learn
now
in
a
few
hours
and
never
forget
again
we
take
a
strange
satisfaction
in
working
arithmetical
problems
we
pause
in
our
building
to
cover
the
stones
with
figures
and
calculations
we
save
money
for
a
latin
grammar
and
algebra
and
carry
them
about
in
our
pockets
poring
over
them
as
over
our
bible
of
old
we
have
thought
we
were
utterly
stupid
incapable
of
remembering
anything
of
learning
anything
now
we
find
that
all
is
easy
has
a
new
soul
crept
into
this
old
body
that
even
our
intellectual
faculties
are
changed
we
marvel
not
perceiving
that
what
a
man
expends
in
prayer
and
ecstasy
he
can
not
have
over
for
acquiring
knowledge
you
never
shed
a
tear
or
create
a
beautiful
image
or
quiver
with
emotion
but
you
pay
for
it
at
the
practical
calculating
end
of
your
nature
you
have
just
so
much
force
when
the
one
channel
runs
over
the
other
runs
dry
and
now
we
turn
to
nature
all
these
years
we
have
lived
beside
her
and
we
have
never
seen
her
and
now
we
open
our
eyes
and
look
at
her
the
rocks
have
been
to
us
a
blur
of
brown
we
bend
over
them
and
the
disorganised
masses
dissolve
into
a
form
of
existence
here
masses
of
crystals
together
there
bands
of
smooth
grey
and
red
methodically
overlying
each
other
this
rock
here
is
covered
with
a
delicate
silver
tracery
in
some
mineral
resembling
leaves
and
branches
there
on
the
flat
stone
on
which
we
so
often
have
sat
to
weep
and
pray
we
look
down
and
see
it
covered
with
the
fossil
footprints
of
great
birds
and
the
beautiful
skeleton
of
a
fish
we
have
often
tried
to
picture
in
our
mind
what
the
fossiled
remains
of
creatures
must
be
like
and
all
the
while
we
sat
on
them
we
have
been
so
blinded
by
thinking
and
feeling
that
we
have
never
seen
the
world
the
flat
plain
has
been
to
us
a
reach
of
monotonous
red
we
look
at
it
and
every
handful
of
sand
starts
into
life
that
wonderful
people
the
ants
we
learn
to
know
see
them
make
war
and
peace
play
and
work
and
build
their
huge
palaces
and
that
smaller
people
we
make
acquaintance
with
who
live
in
the
flowers
the
bitto
flower
has
been
for
us
a
mere
blur
of
yellow
we
find
its
heart
composed
of
a
hundred
perfect
flowers
the
homes
of
the
tiny
black
people
with
red
stripes
who
move
in
and
out
in
that
little
yellow
city
every
bluebell
has
its
inhabitant
every
day
the
karoo
shows
us
a
new
wonder
sleeping
in
its
teeming
bosom
on
our
way
back
to
work
we
pause
and
stand
to
see
the
make
its
trap
bury
itself
in
the
sand
and
then
wait
for
the
falling
in
of
its
enemy
further
on
walks
a
horned
beetle
and
near
him
starts
open
the
door
of
a
spider
who
peeps
out
carefully
and
quickly
pulls
it
down
again
on
a
a
green
fly
is
laying
her
silver
eggs
we
carry
them
home
and
see
the
shells
pierced
the
spotted
grub
come
out
turn
to
a
green
fly
and
flit
away
we
are
not
satisfied
with
what
nature
shows
us
and
we
see
something
for
ourselves
under
the
white
hen
we
put
a
dozen
eggs
and
break
one
daily
to
see
the
white
spot
wax
into
the
chicken
we
are
not
excited
or
enthusiastic
about
it
but
a
man
is
not
to
lay
his
throat
open
he
must
think
of
something
so
we
plant
seeds
in
rows
on
our
and
pull
one
up
daily
to
see
how
it
goes
with
them
alladeen
buried
her
wonderful
stone
and
a
golden
palace
sprung
up
at
her
feet
we
do
far
more
we
put
a
brown
seed
in
the
earth
and
a
living
thing
starts
out
starts
upward
why
no
more
than
alladeen
can
we
say
starts
upward
and
does
not
desist
till
it
is
higher
than
our
heads
sparkling
with
dew
in
the
early
morning
glittering
with
yellow
blossoms
shaking
brown
seeds
with
little
embryo
souls
on
to
the
ground
we
look
at
it
solemnly
from
the
time
it
consists
of
two
leaves
peeping
above
the
ground
and
a
soft
white
root
till
we
have
to
raise
our
faces
to
look
at
it
but
we
find
no
reason
for
that
upward
starting
we
look
into
dead
ducks
and
lambs
in
the
evening
we
carry
them
home
spread
newspapers
on
the
floor
and
lie
working
with
them
till
midnight
with
a
started
feeling
near
akin
to
ecstasy
we
open
the
lump
of
flesh
called
a
heart
and
find
little
doors
and
strings
inside
we
feel
them
and
put
the
heart
away
but
every
now
and
then
return
to
look
and
to
feel
them
again
why
we
like
them
so
we
can
hardly
tell
a
gander
drowns
itself
in
our
dam
we
take
it
out
and
open
it
on
the
bank
and
kneel
looking
at
it
above
are
the
organs
divided
by
delicate
tissues
below
are
the
intestines
artistically
curved
in
a
spiral
form
and
each
tier
covered
by
a
delicate
network
of
standing
out
red
against
the
faint
blue
background
each
branch
of
the
is
comprised
of
a
trunk
bifurcating
and
rebifurcating
into
the
most
delicate
threads
symmetrically
arranged
we
are
struck
with
its
singular
beauty
and
moreover
and
here
we
drop
from
our
kneeling
into
a
sitting
posture
this
also
we
remark
of
that
same
exact
shape
and
outline
is
our
seen
against
the
sky
in
of
that
shape
also
is
delicate
metallic
tracery
between
our
rocks
in
that
exact
path
does
our
water
flow
when
without
a
furrow
we
lead
it
from
the
dam
so
shaped
are
the
antlers
of
the
horned
beetle
how
are
these
things
related
that
such
deep
union
should
exist
between
them
all
is
it
chance
or
are
they
not
all
the
fine
branches
of
one
trunk
whose
sap
flows
through
us
all
that
would
explain
it
we
nod
over
the
gander
s
inside
this
thing
we
call
existence
is
it
not
a
something
which
has
its
roots
far
down
below
in
the
dark
and
its
branches
stretching
out
into
the
immensity
above
which
we
among
the
branches
can
not
see
not
a
chance
jungle
a
living
thing
a
one
the
thought
gives
us
intense
satisfaction
we
can
not
tell
why
we
nod
over
the
gander
then
start
up
suddenly
look
into
the
blue
sky
throw
the
dead
gander
and
the
refuse
into
the
dam
and
go
to
work
again
and
so
it
comes
to
pass
in
time
that
the
earth
ceases
for
us
to
be
a
weltering
chaos
we
walk
in
the
great
hall
of
life
looking
up
and
round
reverentially
nothing
is
despicable
all
is
nothing
is
small
all
is
part
of
a
whole
whose
beginning
and
end
we
know
not
the
life
that
throbs
in
us
is
a
beginning
and
end
we
know
not
the
life
that
throbs
in
us
is
a
pulsation
from
it
too
mighty
for
our
comprehension
not
too
small
and
so
it
comes
to
pass
at
last
that
whereas
the
sky
was
at
first
a
small
blue
rag
stretched
out
over
us
and
so
low
that
our
hands
might
touch
it
pressing
down
on
us
it
raises
itself
into
an
immeasurable
blue
arch
over
our
heads
and
we
begin
to
live
again
chapter
waldo
s
stranger
waldo
lay
on
his
stomach
on
the
red
sand
the
small
ostriches
he
herded
wandered
about
him
pecking
at
the
food
he
had
cut
or
at
pebbles
and
dry
sticks
on
his
right
lay
the
graves
to
his
left
the
dam
in
his
hand
was
a
large
wooden
post
covered
with
carvings
at
which
he
worked
doss
lay
before
him
basking
in
the
winter
sunshine
and
now
and
again
casting
an
expectant
glance
at
the
corner
of
the
nearest
ostrich
camp
the
scrubby
under
which
they
lay
yielded
no
shade
but
none
was
needed
in
that
glorious
june
weather
when
in
the
hottest
part
of
the
afternoon
the
sun
was
but
pleasantly
warm
and
the
boy
carved
on
not
looking
up
yet
conscious
of
the
brown
serene
earth
about
him
and
the
intensely
blue
sky
above
presently
at
the
corner
of
the
camp
em
appeared
bearing
a
covered
saucer
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
a
jug
with
a
cup
in
the
top
she
was
grown
into
a
premature
little
old
woman
of
sixteen
ridiculously
fat
the
jug
and
saucer
she
put
down
on
the
ground
before
the
dog
and
his
master
and
dropped
down
beside
them
herself
panting
and
out
of
breath
waldo
as
i
came
up
the
camps
i
met
some
one
on
horseback
and
i
do
believe
it
must
be
the
new
man
that
is
the
new
man
was
an
englishman
to
whom
the
had
hired
half
the
farm
hum
said
waldo
he
is
quite
young
said
em
holding
her
side
and
he
has
brown
hair
and
beard
curling
close
to
his
face
and
such
dark
blue
eyes
and
waldo
i
was
so
ashamed
i
was
just
looking
back
to
see
you
know
and
he
happened
just
to
be
looking
back
too
and
we
looked
right
into
each
other
s
faces
and
he
got
red
and
i
got
so
red
i
believe
he
is
the
new
yes
said
waldo
i
must
go
now
perhaps
he
has
brought
us
letters
from
the
post
from
lyndall
you
know
she
can
t
stay
at
school
much
longer
she
must
come
back
soon
and
the
new
man
will
have
to
stay
with
us
till
his
house
is
built
i
must
get
his
room
ready
she
tripped
off
again
and
waldo
carved
on
at
his
post
doss
lay
with
his
nose
close
to
the
covered
saucer
and
smelt
that
some
one
had
made
nice
little
fat
cakes
that
afternoon
both
were
so
intent
on
their
occupation
that
not
till
a
horse
s
hoofs
beat
beside
them
in
the
sand
did
they
look
up
to
see
a
rider
drawing
in
his
steed
he
was
certainly
not
the
stranger
whom
em
had
described
a
dark
somewhat
little
man
of
rather
stout
with
heavy
cloudy
eyes
and
pointed
moustaches
his
horse
was
a
fiery
creature
well
caparisoned
a
saddlebag
hung
from
the
saddle
the
man
s
hands
were
gloved
and
he
presented
the
appearance
rare
on
that
farm
of
a
gentleman
in
an
uncommonly
melodious
voice
he
inquired
whether
he
might
be
allowed
to
remain
there
for
an
hour
waldo
directed
him
to
the
farmhouse
but
the
stranger
declined
he
would
merely
rest
under
the
trees
and
give
his
horse
water
he
removed
the
saddle
and
waldo
led
the
animal
away
to
the
dam
when
he
returned
the
stranger
had
settled
himself
under
the
trees
with
his
back
against
the
saddle
the
boy
offered
him
of
the
cakes
he
declined
but
took
a
draught
from
the
jug
and
waldo
lay
down
not
far
off
and
fell
to
work
again
it
mattered
nothing
if
cold
eyes
saw
it
it
was
not
his
machine
with
material
loves
as
with
human
we
go
mad
once
love
out
and
have
done
we
never
get
up
the
true
enthusiasm
a
second
time
this
was
but
a
thing
he
had
made
laboured
over
loved
and
liked
nothing
more
not
his
machine
the
stranger
forced
himself
lower
down
in
the
saddle
and
yawned
it
was
a
drowsy
afternoon
and
he
objected
to
travel
in
these
parts
he
liked
better
civilised
life
where
at
every
hour
of
the
day
a
man
may
look
for
his
glass
of
wine
and
his
and
paper
where
at
night
he
may
lock
himself
into
his
room
with
his
books
and
a
bottle
of
brandy
and
taste
joys
mental
and
physical
the
world
said
of
him
the
omnipotent
world
whom
no
locks
can
bar
who
has
the
propensity
of
seeing
best
in
the
dark
the
world
said
that
better
than
the
books
he
loved
the
brandy
and
better
than
books
or
brandy
that
which
it
had
been
better
had
he
loved
less
but
for
the
world
he
cared
nothing
he
smiled
blandly
in
its
teeth
all
life
is
a
dream
if
wine
and
philosophy
and
women
keep
the
dream
from
becoming
a
nightmare
so
much
the
better
it
is
all
they
are
fit
for
all
they
can
be
used
for
there
was
another
side
to
his
life
and
thought
but
of
that
the
world
knew
nothing
and
said
nothing
as
the
way
of
the
wise
world
is
the
stranger
looked
from
beneath
his
sleepy
eyelids
at
the
brown
earth
that
stretched
away
beautiful
in
spite
of
itself
in
that
june
sunshine
looked
at
the
graves
the
gables
of
the
farmhouse
showing
over
the
stone
walls
of
the
camps
at
the
clownish
fellow
at
his
feet
and
yawned
but
he
had
drunk
of
the
hind
s
tea
and
must
say
something
your
father
s
place
i
presume
he
inquired
sleepily
no
i
am
only
a
dutch
people
and
you
like
the
life
the
boy
hesitated
on
days
like
and
why
on
these
the
boy
waited
they
are
very
the
stranger
looked
at
him
it
seemed
that
as
the
fellow
s
dark
eyes
looked
across
the
brown
earth
they
kindled
with
an
intense
satisfaction
then
they
looked
back
at
the
carving
what
had
that
creature
so
and
clownish
to
do
with
the
subtle
joys
of
the
weather
himself
and
delicate
he
might
hear
the
music
with
shimmering
sunshine
and
solitude
play
on
the
chords
of
nature
but
that
fellow
was
not
the
ear
in
that
great
body
too
gross
for
such
delicate
mutterings
presently
he
said
may
i
see
what
you
work
at
the
fellow
handed
his
wooden
post
it
was
by
no
means
lovely
the
men
and
birds
were
almost
grotesque
in
their
laboured
resemblance
to
nature
and
bore
signs
of
patient
thought
the
stranger
turned
the
thing
over
on
his
knee
where
did
you
learn
this
work
i
taught
and
these
zigzag
lines
represent
a
the
stranger
looked
it
has
some
meaning
has
it
not
the
boy
muttered
confusedly
only
the
questioner
looked
down
at
him
the
huge
unwieldy
figure
in
size
a
man
s
in
right
of
his
childlike
features
and
curling
hair
a
child
s
and
it
hurt
him
it
attracted
him
and
it
hurt
him
it
was
something
between
pity
and
sympathy
how
long
have
you
worked
at
this
nine
from
his
pocket
the
stranger
drew
his
and
took
something
from
it
he
could
fasten
the
post
to
his
horse
in
some
way
and
throw
it
away
in
the
sand
when
at
a
safe
distance
will
you
take
this
for
your
carving
the
boy
glanced
at
the
note
and
shook
his
head
no
i
can
not
you
think
it
is
worth
more
asked
the
stranger
with
a
little
sneer
he
pointed
with
his
thumb
to
a
grave
no
it
is
for
and
who
is
there
asked
the
stranger
my
the
man
silently
returned
the
note
to
his
and
gave
the
carving
to
the
boy
and
drawing
his
hat
over
his
eyes
composed
himself
to
sleep
not
being
able
to
do
so
after
a
while
he
glanced
over
the
fellow
s
shoulder
to
watch
him
work
the
boy
carved
letters
into
the
back
if
said
the
stranger
with
his
melodious
voice
rich
with
a
sweetness
that
never
showed
itself
in
the
clouded
eyes
for
sweetness
will
linger
on
in
the
voice
long
after
it
has
died
out
in
the
eyes
if
for
such
a
purpose
why
write
that
upon
it
the
boy
glanced
round
at
him
but
made
no
answer
he
had
almost
forgotten
his
presence
you
surely
believe
said
the
stranger
that
some
day
sooner
or
later
these
graves
will
open
and
those
with
their
wives
walk
about
here
in
the
red
sand
with
the
very
fleshly
legs
with
which
they
went
to
sleep
then
why
say
he
sleeps
forever
you
believe
he
will
stand
up
again
do
you
asked
the
boy
lifting
for
an
instant
his
heavy
eyes
to
the
stranger
s
face
half
taken
aback
the
stranger
laughed
it
was
as
though
a
curious
little
tadpole
which
he
held
under
his
glass
should
suddenly
lift
its
tail
and
begin
to
question
him
i
he
laughed
his
short
thick
laugh
i
am
a
man
who
believes
nothing
hopes
nothing
fears
nothing
feels
nothing
i
am
beyond
the
pale
of
humanity
no
criterion
of
what
you
should
be
who
live
here
among
your
ostriches
and
the
next
moment
the
stranger
was
surprised
by
a
sudden
movement
on
the
part
of
the
fellow
which
brought
him
close
to
the
stranger
s
feet
soon
after
he
raised
his
carving
and
laid
it
across
the
man
s
knee
yes
i
will
tell
you
he
muttered
i
will
tell
you
all
about
he
put
his
finger
on
the
grotesque
little
mannikin
at
the
bottom
ah
that
man
who
believed
nothing
hoped
nothing
felt
nothing
how
he
loved
him
and
with
eager
finger
the
fellow
moved
upward
explaining
over
fantastic
figures
and
mountains
to
the
crowning
bird
from
whose
wing
dropped
a
feather
at
the
end
he
spoke
with
broken
breath
short
words
like
one
who
utters
things
of
mighty
import
the
stranger
watched
more
the
face
than
the
carving
and
there
was
now
and
then
a
show
of
white
teeth
beneath
the
moustaches
as
he
listened
i
think
he
said
blandly
when
the
boy
had
done
that
i
partly
understand
you
it
is
something
after
this
fashion
is
it
not
he
smiled
in
certain
valleys
there
was
a
he
touched
the
grotesque
little
figure
at
the
bottom
day
by
day
he
went
to
hunt
for
in
the
woods
and
it
chanced
that
once
he
stood
on
the
shores
of
a
large
lake
while
he
stood
waiting
in
the
rushes
for
the
coming
of
the
birds
a
great
shadow
fell
on
him
and
in
the
water
he
saw
a
reflection
he
looked
up
to
the
sky
but
the
thing
was
gone
then
a
burning
desire
came
over
him
to
see
once
again
that
reflection
in
the
water
and
all
day
he
watched
and
waited
but
night
came
and
it
had
not
returned
then
he
went
home
with
his
empty
bag
moody
and
silent
his
comrades
came
questioning
about
him
to
know
the
reason
but
he
answered
them
nothing
he
sat
alone
and
brooded
then
his
friend
came
to
him
and
to
him
he
spoke
i
have
seen
today
he
said
that
which
i
never
saw
before
a
vast
white
bird
with
silver
wings
outstretched
sailing
in
the
everlasting
blue
and
now
it
is
as
though
a
great
fire
burnt
within
my
breast
it
was
but
a
sheen
a
shimmer
a
reflection
in
the
water
but
now
i
desire
nothing
more
on
earth
than
to
hold
his
friend
laughed
it
was
but
a
beam
playing
on
the
water
or
the
shadow
of
your
own
head
tomorrow
you
will
forget
her
he
said
but
tomorrow
and
tomorrow
and
tomorrow
the
hunter
walked
alone
he
sought
in
the
forest
and
in
the
woods
by
the
lakes
and
among
the
rushes
but
he
could
not
find
her
he
shot
no
more
wild
fowl
what
were
they
to
him
what
ails
him
said
his
comrades
he
is
mad
said
one
no
but
he
is
worse
said
another
he
would
see
that
which
none
of
us
have
seen
and
make
himself
a
come
let
us
forswear
his
company
said
all
so
the
hunter
walked
alone
one
night
as
he
wandered
in
the
shade
very
heartsore
and
weeping
an
old
man
stood
before
him
grander
and
taller
than
the
sons
of
men
who
are
you
asked
the
hunter
i
am
wisdom
answered
the
old
man
but
some
men
call
me
knowledge
all
my
life
i
have
grown
in
these
valleys
but
no
man
sees
me
till
he
has
sorrowed
much
the
eyes
must
be
washed
with
tears
that
are
to
behold
me
and
according
as
a
man
has
suffered
i
and
the
hunter
cried
oh
you
who
have
lived
here
so
long
tell
me
what
is
that
great
wild
bird
i
have
seen
sailing
in
the
blue
they
would
have
me
believe
she
is
a
dream
the
shadow
of
my
own
the
old
man
smiled
her
name
is
truth
he
who
has
once
seen
her
never
rests
again
till
death
he
desires
and
the
hunter
cried
oh
tell
me
where
i
may
find
but
the
old
man
said
you
have
not
suffered
enough
and
went
then
the
hunter
took
from
his
breast
the
shuttle
of
imagination
and
wound
on
it
the
thread
of
his
wishes
and
all
night
he
sat
and
wove
a
net
in
the
morning
he
spread
the
golden
net
upon
the
ground
and
into
it
he
threw
a
few
grains
of
credulity
which
his
father
had
left
him
and
which
he
kept
in
his
they
were
like
white
and
when
you
trod
on
them
a
brown
dust
flew
out
then
he
sat
by
to
see
what
would
happen
the
first
that
came
into
the
net
was
a
bird
with
dove
s
eyes
and
he
sang
a
beautiful
song
a
a
a
it
sang
the
second
that
came
was
black
and
mystical
with
dark
lovely
eyes
that
looked
into
the
depths
of
your
soul
and
he
sang
only
this
immortality
and
the
hunter
took
them
both
in
his
arms
for
he
said
they
are
surely
of
the
beautiful
family
of
then
came
another
green
and
gold
who
sang
in
a
shrill
voice
like
one
crying
in
the
marketplace
reward
after
death
reward
after
death
and
he
said
you
are
not
so
fair
but
you
are
fair
too
and
he
took
it
and
others
came
brightly
coloured
singing
pleasant
songs
till
all
the
grains
were
finished
and
the
hunter
gathered
all
his
birds
together
and
built
a
strong
iron
cage
called
a
new
creed
and
put
all
his
birds
in
it
then
the
people
came
about
dancing
and
singing
oh
happy
hunter
they
cried
oh
wonderful
man
oh
delightful
birds
oh
lovely
songs
no
one
asked
where
the
birds
had
come
from
nor
how
they
had
been
caught
but
they
danced
and
sang
before
them
and
the
hunter
too
was
glad
for
he
said
surely
truth
is
among
them
in
time
she
will
moult
her
feathers
and
i
shall
see
her
but
the
time
passed
and
the
people
sang
and
danced
but
the
hunter
s
heart
grew
heavy
he
crept
alone
as
of
old
to
weep
the
terrible
desire
had
awakened
again
in
his
breast
one
day
as
he
sat
alone
weeping
it
chanced
that
wisdom
met
him
he
told
the
old
man
what
he
had
done
and
wisdom
smiled
sadly
many
men
he
said
have
spread
that
net
for
truth
but
they
have
never
found
her
on
the
grains
of
credulity
she
will
not
feed
in
the
net
of
wishes
her
feet
can
not
be
held
in
the
air
of
these
valleys
she
will
not
breathe
the
birds
you
have
caught
are
of
the
brood
of
lies
lovely
and
beautiful
but
still
lies
truth
knows
them
and
the
hunter
cried
out
in
bitterness
and
must
i
then
sit
still
to
be
devoured
of
this
great
burning
and
the
old
man
said
listen
and
in
that
you
have
suffered
much
and
wept
much
i
will
tell
you
what
i
know
he
who
sets
out
to
search
for
truth
must
leave
these
valleys
of
superstition
forever
taking
with
him
not
one
shred
that
has
belonged
to
them
alone
he
must
wander
down
into
the
land
of
absolute
negation
and
denial
he
must
abide
there
he
must
resist
temptation
when
the
light
breaks
he
must
arise
and
follow
it
into
the
country
of
dry
sunshine
the
mountains
of
stern
reality
will
rise
before
him
he
must
climb
them
beyond
them
lies
and
he
will
hold
her
fast
he
will
hold
her
in
his
hands
the
hunter
cried
wisdom
shook
his
head
he
will
never
see
her
never
hold
her
the
time
is
not
then
there
is
no
hope
cried
the
hunter
there
is
this
said
wisdom
some
men
have
climbed
on
those
mountains
circle
above
circle
of
bare
rock
they
have
scaled
and
wandering
there
in
those
high
regions
some
have
chanced
to
pick
up
on
the
ground
one
white
silver
feather
dropped
from
the
wing
of
truth
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
said
the
old
man
raising
himself
prophetically
and
pointing
with
his
finger
to
the
sky
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
when
enough
of
those
silver
feathers
shall
have
been
gathered
by
the
hands
of
men
and
shall
have
been
woven
into
a
cord
and
the
cord
into
a
net
that
in
that
net
truth
may
be
captured
nothing
but
truth
can
hold
the
hunter
arose
i
will
go
he
said
but
wisdom
detained
him
mark
you
well
who
leaves
these
valleys
never
returns
to
them
though
he
should
weep
tears
of
blood
seven
days
and
nights
upon
the
confines
he
can
never
put
his
foot
across
them
left
they
are
left
forever
upon
the
road
which
you
would
travel
there
is
no
reward
offered
who
goes
goes
freely
for
the
great
love
that
is
in
him
the
work
is
his
i
go
said
the
hunter
but
upon
the
mountains
tell
me
which
path
shall
i
take
i
am
the
child
of
said
the
man
i
can
walk
only
where
many
men
have
trodden
on
these
mountains
few
feet
have
passed
each
man
strikes
out
a
path
for
himself
he
goes
at
his
own
peril
my
voice
he
hears
no
more
i
may
follow
after
him
but
can
not
go
before
then
knowledge
vanished
and
the
hunter
turned
he
went
to
his
cage
and
with
his
hands
broke
down
the
bars
and
the
jagged
iron
tore
his
flesh
it
is
sometimes
easier
to
build
than
to
break
one
by
one
he
took
his
plumed
birds
and
let
them
fly
but
when
he
came
to
his
bird
he
held
it
and
looked
into
its
beautiful
eyes
and
the
bird
uttered
its
low
deep
cry
immortality
and
he
said
quickly
i
can
not
part
with
it
it
is
not
heavy
it
eats
no
food
i
will
hide
it
in
my
breast
i
will
take
it
with
and
he
buried
it
there
and
covered
it
over
with
his
cloak
but
the
thing
he
had
hidden
grew
heavier
heavier
heavier
till
it
lay
on
his
breast
like
lead
he
could
not
move
with
it
he
could
not
leave
those
valleys
with
it
then
again
he
took
it
out
and
looked
at
it
oh
my
beautiful
my
heart
s
own
he
cried
may
i
not
keep
you
he
opened
his
hands
sadly
go
he
said
it
may
happen
that
in
truth
s
song
one
note
is
like
yours
but
i
shall
never
hear
sadly
he
opened
his
hand
and
the
bird
flew
from
him
forever
then
from
the
shuttle
of
imagination
he
took
the
thread
of
his
wishes
and
threw
it
on
the
ground
and
the
empty
shuttle
he
put
into
his
breast
for
the
thread
was
made
in
those
valleys
but
the
shuttle
came
from
an
unknown
country
he
turned
to
go
but
now
the
people
came
about
him
howling
fool
hound
demented
lunatic
they
cried
how
dared
you
break
your
cage
and
let
the
birds
fly
the
hunter
spoke
but
they
would
not
hear
him
truth
who
is
she
can
you
eat
her
can
you
drink
her
who
has
ever
seen
her
your
birds
were
real
all
could
hear
them
sing
oh
fool
vile
reptile
atheist
they
cried
you
pollute
the
come
let
us
take
up
stones
and
stone
him
cried
some
what
affair
is
it
of
ours
said
others
let
the
idiot
go
and
went
away
but
the
rest
gathered
up
stones
and
mud
and
threw
at
him
at
last
when
he
was
bruised
and
cut
the
hunter
crept
away
into
the
woods
and
it
was
evening
about
at
every
word
the
stranger
spoke
the
fellow
s
eyes
flashed
back
on
him
yes
and
yes
and
yes
the
stranger
smiled
it
was
almost
worth
the
trouble
of
exerting
oneself
even
on
a
lazy
afternoon
to
win
those
passionate
flashes
more
thirsty
and
desiring
than
the
of
a
woman
he
wandered
on
and
on
said
the
stranger
and
the
shade
grew
deeper
he
was
on
the
borders
now
of
the
land
where
it
is
always
night
then
he
stepped
into
it
and
there
was
no
light
there
with
his
hands
he
groped
but
each
branch
as
he
touched
it
broke
off
and
the
earth
was
covered
with
cinders
at
every
step
his
foot
sank
in
and
a
fine
cloud
of
impalpable
ashes
flew
up
into
his
face
and
it
was
dark
so
he
sat
down
upon
a
stone
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
to
wait
in
the
land
of
negation
and
denial
till
the
light
came
and
it
was
night
in
his
heart
also
then
from
the
marshes
to
his
right
and
left
cold
mists
arose
and
closed
about
him
a
fine
imperceptible
rain
fell
in
the
dark
and
great
drops
gathered
on
his
hair
and
clothes
his
heart
beat
slowly
and
a
numbness
crept
through
all
his
limbs
then
looking
up
two
merry
wisp
lights
came
dancing
he
lifted
his
head
to
look
at
them
nearer
nearer
they
came
so
warm
so
bright
they
danced
like
stars
of
fire
they
stood
before
him
at
last
from
the
centre
of
the
radiating
flame
in
one
looked
out
a
woman
s
face
laughing
dimpled
with
streaming
yellow
hair
in
the
centre
of
the
other
were
merry
laughing
ripples
like
the
bubbles
on
a
glass
of
wine
they
danced
before
him
who
are
you
asked
the
hunter
who
alone
come
to
me
in
my
solitude
and
darkness
we
are
the
twins
sensuality
they
cried
our
father
s
name
is
and
our
mother
s
name
is
excess
we
are
as
old
as
the
hills
and
rivers
as
old
as
the
first
man
but
we
never
die
they
laughed
oh
let
me
wrap
my
arms
about
you
cried
the
first
they
are
soft
and
warm
your
heart
is
frozen
now
but
i
will
make
it
beat
oh
come
to
me
i
will
pour
my
hot
life
into
you
said
the
second
your
brain
is
numb
and
your
limbs
are
dead
now
but
they
shall
live
with
a
fierce
free
life
oh
let
me
pour
it
in
oh
follow
us
they
cried
and
live
with
us
nobler
hearts
than
yours
have
sat
here
in
this
darkness
to
wait
and
they
have
come
to
us
and
we
to
them
and
they
have
never
left
us
never
all
else
is
a
delusion
but
we
are
real
we
are
real
we
are
real
truth
is
a
shadow
the
valleys
of
superstition
are
a
farce
the
earth
is
of
ashes
the
trees
all
rotten
but
we
feel
us
we
live
you
can
not
doubt
us
feel
us
how
warm
we
are
oh
come
to
us
come
with
us
nearer
and
nearer
round
his
head
they
hovered
and
the
cold
drops
melted
on
his
forehead
the
bright
light
shot
into
his
eyes
dazzling
him
and
the
frozen
blood
began
to
run
and
he
said
yes
why
should
i
die
here
in
this
awful
darkness
they
are
warm
they
melt
my
frozen
blood
and
he
stretched
out
his
hands
to
take
them
then
in
a
moment
there
arose
before
him
the
image
of
the
thing
he
had
loved
and
his
hand
dropped
to
his
side
oh
come
to
us
they
cried
but
he
buried
his
face
you
dazzle
my
eyes
he
cried
you
make
my
heart
warm
but
you
can
not
give
me
what
i
desire
i
will
wait
here
wait
till
i
die
go
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
would
not
listen
and
when
he
looked
up
again
they
were
two
twinkling
stars
that
vanished
in
the
distance
and
the
long
long
night
rolled
on
all
who
leave
the
valley
of
superstition
pass
through
that
dark
land
but
some
go
through
it
in
a
few
days
some
linger
there
for
months
some
for
years
and
some
die
the
boy
had
crept
closer
his
hot
breath
almost
touched
the
stranger
s
hand
a
mystic
wonder
filled
his
eyes
at
last
for
the
hunter
a
faint
light
played
along
the
horizon
and
he
rose
to
follow
it
and
he
reached
that
light
at
last
and
stepped
into
the
broad
sunshine
then
before
him
rose
the
almighty
mountains
of
and
realities
the
clear
sunshine
played
on
them
and
the
tops
were
lost
in
the
clouds
at
the
foot
many
paths
ran
up
an
exultant
cry
burst
from
the
hunter
he
chose
the
straightest
and
began
to
climb
and
the
rocks
and
ridges
resounded
with
his
song
they
had
exaggerated
after
all
it
was
not
so
high
nor
was
the
road
so
steep
a
few
days
a
few
weeks
a
few
months
at
most
and
then
the
top
not
one
feather
only
would
he
pick
up
he
would
gather
all
that
other
men
had
found
weave
the
net
capture
truth
hold
her
fast
touch
her
with
his
hands
clasp
her
he
laughed
in
the
merry
sunshine
and
sang
loud
victory
was
very
near
nevertheless
after
a
while
the
path
grew
steeper
he
needed
all
his
breath
for
climbing
and
the
singing
died
away
on
the
right
and
left
rose
huge
rocks
devoid
of
lichen
or
moss
and
in
the
earth
chasms
yawned
here
and
there
he
saw
a
sheen
of
white
bones
now
too
the
path
began
to
grow
less
and
less
marked
then
it
became
a
mere
trace
with
a
footmark
here
and
there
then
it
ceased
altogether
he
sang
no
more
but
struck
forth
a
path
for
himself
until
it
reached
a
mighty
wall
of
rock
smooth
and
without
break
stretching
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
i
will
rear
a
stair
against
it
and
once
this
wall
climbed
i
shall
be
almost
there
he
said
bravely
and
worked
with
his
shuttle
of
imagination
he
dug
out
stones
but
half
of
them
would
not
fit
and
half
a
month
s
work
would
roll
down
because
those
below
were
ill
chosen
but
the
hunter
worked
on
saying
always
to
himself
once
this
wall
climbed
i
shall
be
almost
there
this
great
work
ended
at
last
he
came
out
upon
the
top
and
he
looked
about
him
far
below
rolled
the
white
mist
over
the
valleys
of
superstition
and
above
him
towered
the
mountains
they
had
seemed
low
before
they
were
of
an
immeasurable
height
now
from
crown
to
foundation
surrounded
by
walls
of
rock
that
rose
tier
above
tier
in
mighty
circles
upon
them
played
the
eternal
sunshine
he
uttered
a
wild
cry
he
bowed
himself
on
to
the
earth
and
when
he
rose
his
face
was
white
in
absolute
silence
he
walked
on
he
was
very
silent
now
in
those
high
regions
the
rarefied
air
is
hard
to
breathe
by
those
born
in
the
valleys
every
breath
he
drew
hurt
him
and
the
blood
oozed
out
from
the
tips
of
his
fingers
before
the
next
wall
of
rock
he
began
to
work
the
height
of
this
seemed
infinite
and
he
said
nothing
the
sound
of
his
tool
rang
night
and
day
upon
the
iron
rocks
into
which
he
cut
steps
years
passed
over
him
yet
he
worked
on
but
the
wall
towered
up
always
above
him
to
heaven
sometimes
he
prayed
that
a
little
moss
or
lichen
might
spring
up
on
those
bare
walls
to
be
a
companion
to
him
but
it
never
the
stranger
watched
the
boy
s
face
and
the
years
rolled
on
he
counted
them
by
the
steps
he
had
cut
a
few
for
a
year
only
a
few
he
sang
no
more
he
said
no
more
i
will
do
this
or
that
he
only
worked
and
at
night
when
the
twilight
settled
down
there
looked
out
at
him
from
the
holes
and
crevices
in
the
rocks
strange
wild
faces
stop
your
work
you
lonely
man
and
speak
to
us
they
cried
my
salvation
is
in
work
if
i
should
stop
but
for
one
moment
you
would
creep
down
upon
me
he
replied
and
they
put
out
their
long
necks
further
look
down
into
the
crevice
at
your
feet
they
said
see
what
lie
there
white
bones
as
brave
and
strong
a
man
as
you
climbed
to
these
and
he
looked
up
he
saw
there
was
no
use
in
striving
he
would
never
hold
truth
never
see
her
never
find
her
so
he
lay
down
here
for
he
was
very
tired
he
went
to
sleep
forever
he
put
himself
to
sleep
sleep
is
very
tranquil
you
are
not
lonely
when
you
are
asleep
neither
do
your
hands
ache
nor
your
heart
and
the
hunter
laughed
between
his
teeth
have
i
torn
from
my
heart
all
that
was
dearest
have
i
wandered
alone
in
the
land
of
night
have
i
resisted
temptation
have
i
dwelt
where
the
voice
of
my
kind
is
never
heard
and
laboured
alone
to
lie
down
and
be
food
for
you
ye
harpies
he
laughed
fiercely
and
the
echoes
of
despair
slunk
away
for
the
laugh
of
a
brave
strong
heart
is
as
a
death
blow
to
them
nevertheless
they
crept
out
again
and
looked
at
him
do
you
know
that
your
hair
is
white
they
said
that
your
hands
begin
to
tremble
like
a
child
s
do
you
see
that
the
point
of
your
shuttle
is
gone
it
is
cracked
already
if
you
should
ever
climb
this
stair
they
said
it
will
be
your
last
you
will
never
climb
and
he
answered
i
know
it
and
worked
on
the
old
thin
hands
cut
the
stones
ill
and
jaggedly
for
the
fingers
were
stiff
and
bent
the
beauty
and
the
strength
of
the
man
was
gone
at
last
an
old
wizened
shrunken
face
looked
out
above
the
rocks
it
saw
the
eternal
mountains
rise
with
walls
to
the
white
clouds
but
its
work
was
done
the
old
hunter
folded
his
tired
hands
and
lay
down
by
the
precipice
where
he
had
worked
away
his
life
it
was
the
sleeping
time
at
last
below
him
over
the
valleys
rolled
the
thick
white
mist
once
it
broke
and
through
the
gap
the
dying
eyes
looked
down
on
the
trees
and
fields
of
their
childhood
from
afar
seemed
borne
to
him
the
cry
of
his
own
wild
birds
and
he
heard
the
noise
of
people
singing
as
they
danced
and
he
thought
he
heard
among
them
the
voices
of
his
old
comrades
and
he
saw
far
off
the
sunlight
shine
on
his
early
home
and
great
tears
gathered
in
the
hunter
s
eyes
ah
they
who
die
there
do
not
die
alone
he
cried
then
the
mists
rolled
together
again
and
he
turned
his
eyes
away
i
have
sought
he
said
for
long
years
i
have
laboured
but
i
have
not
found
her
i
have
not
rested
i
have
not
repined
and
i
have
not
seen
her
now
my
strength
is
gone
where
i
lie
down
worn
out
other
men
will
stand
young
and
fresh
by
the
steps
that
i
have
cut
they
will
climb
by
the
stairs
that
i
have
built
they
will
mount
they
will
never
know
the
name
of
the
man
who
made
them
at
the
clumsy
work
they
will
laugh
when
the
stones
roll
they
will
curse
me
but
they
will
mount
and
on
my
work
they
will
climb
and
by
my
stair
they
will
find
her
and
through
me
and
no
man
liveth
to
himself
and
no
man
dieth
to
the
tears
rolled
from
beneath
the
shrivelled
eyelids
if
truth
had
appeared
above
him
in
the
clouds
now
he
could
not
have
seen
her
the
mist
of
death
was
in
his
eyes
my
soul
hears
their
glad
step
coming
he
said
and
they
shall
mount
they
shall
mount
he
raised
his
shrivelled
hand
to
his
eyes
then
slowly
from
the
white
sky
above
through
the
still
air
came
something
falling
falling
falling
softly
it
fluttered
down
and
dropped
on
to
the
breast
of
the
dying
man
he
felt
it
with
his
hands
it
was
a
feather
he
died
holding
the
boy
had
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
on
the
wood
of
the
carving
great
drops
fell
the
stranger
must
have
laughed
at
him
or
remained
silent
he
did
so
how
did
you
know
it
the
boy
whispered
at
last
it
is
not
written
there
not
on
that
wood
how
did
you
know
it
certainly
said
the
stranger
the
whole
of
the
story
is
not
written
here
but
it
is
suggested
and
the
attribute
of
all
true
art
the
highest
and
the
lowest
is
this
that
it
rays
more
than
it
says
and
takes
you
away
from
itself
it
is
a
little
door
that
opens
into
an
infinite
hall
where
you
may
find
what
you
please
men
thinking
to
detract
say
people
read
more
in
this
or
that
work
of
genius
than
was
ever
written
in
it
not
perceiving
that
they
pay
the
highest
compliment
if
we
pick
up
the
finger
and
nail
of
a
real
man
we
can
decipher
a
whole
story
could
almost
reconstruct
the
creature
again
from
head
to
foot
but
half
the
body
of
a
idol
leaves
us
utterly
in
the
dark
as
to
what
the
rest
was
like
we
see
what
we
see
but
nothing
more
there
is
nothing
so
universally
intelligible
as
truth
it
has
a
thousand
meanings
and
suggests
a
thousand
he
turned
over
the
wooden
thing
though
a
man
should
carve
it
into
matter
with
the
least
possible
manipulative
skill
it
will
yet
find
interpreters
it
is
the
soul
that
looks
out
with
burning
eyes
through
the
most
gross
fleshly
filament
whosoever
should
portray
truly
the
life
and
death
of
a
little
flower
its
birth
sucking
in
of
nourishment
reproduction
of
its
kind
withering
and
vanishing
would
have
shaped
a
symbol
of
all
existence
all
true
facts
of
nature
or
the
mind
are
related
your
little
carving
represents
some
mental
facts
as
they
really
are
therefore
fifty
different
true
stories
might
be
read
from
it
what
your
work
wants
is
not
truth
but
beauty
of
external
form
the
other
half
of
he
leaned
almost
gently
toward
the
boy
skill
may
come
in
time
but
you
will
have
to
work
hard
the
love
of
beauty
and
the
desire
for
it
must
be
born
in
a
man
the
skill
to
reproduce
it
he
must
make
he
must
work
all
my
life
i
have
longed
to
see
you
the
boy
said
the
stranger
broke
off
the
end
of
his
cigar
and
lit
it
the
boy
lifted
the
heavy
wood
from
the
stranger
s
knee
and
drew
yet
nearer
him
in
the
manner
of
his
drawing
near
there
was
something
superbly
ridiculous
unless
one
chanced
to
view
it
in
another
light
presently
the
stranger
said
whiffing
do
something
for
the
boy
started
up
no
stay
where
you
are
i
don
t
want
you
to
go
anyowhere
i
want
you
to
talk
to
me
tell
me
what
you
have
been
doing
all
your
the
boy
slunk
down
again
would
that
the
man
had
asked
him
to
root
up
bushes
with
his
hands
for
his
horse
to
feed
on
or
to
run
to
the
far
end
of
the
plain
for
the
fossils
that
lay
there
or
to
gather
the
flowers
that
grew
on
the
hills
at
the
edge
of
the
plain
he
would
have
run
and
been
back
quickly
but
now
i
have
never
done
anything
he
said
then
tell
me
of
that
nothing
i
like
to
know
what
other
folks
have
been
doing
whose
word
i
can
believe
it
is
interesting
what
was
the
first
thing
you
ever
wanted
very
much
the
boy
waited
to
remember
then
began
hesitatingly
but
soon
the
words
flowed
in
the
smallest
past
we
find
an
inexhaustible
mine
when
once
we
begin
to
dig
at
it
a
confused
disordered
story
the
little
made
large
and
the
large
small
and
nothing
showing
its
inward
meaning
it
is
not
till
the
past
has
receded
many
steps
that
before
the
clearest
eyes
it
falls
into
pictures
it
is
not
till
the
i
we
tell
of
has
ceased
to
exist
that
it
takes
its
place
among
other
objective
realities
and
finds
its
true
niche
in
the
picture
the
present
and
the
near
past
is
a
confusion
whose
meaning
flashes
on
us
as
it
slinks
away
into
the
distance
the
stranger
lit
one
cigar
from
the
end
of
another
and
puffed
and
listened
with
eyes
i
will
remember
more
to
tell
you
if
you
like
said
the
boy
he
spoke
with
that
extreme
gravity
common
to
all
very
young
things
who
feel
deeply
it
is
not
till
twenty
that
we
learn
to
be
in
deadly
earnest
and
to
laugh
the
stranger
nodded
while
the
fellow
sought
for
something
more
to
relate
he
would
tell
all
to
this
man
of
his
all
that
he
knew
all
that
he
had
felt
his
inmost
sorest
thought
suddenly
the
stranger
turned
upon
him
boy
he
said
you
are
happy
to
be
waldo
looked
at
him
was
his
delightful
one
ridiculing
him
here
with
this
brown
earth
and
these
low
hills
while
the
rare
wonderful
world
lay
all
beyond
fortunate
to
be
here
the
stranger
read
his
glance
yes
he
said
here
with
the
and
red
sand
do
you
wonder
what
i
mean
to
all
who
have
been
born
in
the
old
faith
there
comes
a
time
of
danger
when
the
old
slips
from
us
and
we
have
not
yet
planted
our
feet
on
the
new
we
hear
the
voice
from
sinai
thundering
no
more
and
the
still
small
voice
of
reason
is
not
yet
heard
we
have
proved
the
religion
our
mothers
fed
us
on
to
be
a
delusion
in
our
bewilderment
we
see
no
rule
by
which
to
guide
our
steps
day
by
day
and
yet
every
day
we
must
step
the
stranger
leaned
forward
and
spoke
more
quickly
we
have
never
once
been
taught
by
word
or
act
to
distinguish
between
religion
and
the
moral
laws
on
which
it
has
artfully
fastened
itself
and
from
which
it
has
sucked
its
vitality
when
we
have
dragged
down
the
weeds
and
creepers
that
covered
the
solid
wall
and
have
found
them
to
be
rotten
wood
we
imagine
the
wall
itself
to
be
rotten
wood
too
we
find
it
is
solid
and
standing
only
when
we
fall
headlong
against
it
we
have
been
taught
that
all
right
and
wrong
originate
in
the
will
of
an
irresponsible
being
it
is
some
time
before
we
see
how
the
inexorable
thou
shalt
and
shalt
not
are
carved
into
the
nature
of
things
this
is
the
time
of
his
dark
misty
eyes
looked
into
the
boy
s
in
the
end
experience
will
inevitably
teach
us
that
the
laws
for
a
wise
and
noble
life
have
a
foundation
infinitely
deeper
than
the
fiat
of
any
being
god
or
man
even
in
the
groundwork
of
human
nature
she
will
teach
us
that
whoso
sheddeth
man
s
blood
though
by
man
his
blood
be
not
shed
though
no
man
avenge
and
no
hell
await
yet
every
drop
shall
blister
on
his
soul
and
eat
in
the
name
of
the
dead
she
will
teach
that
whoso
takes
a
love
not
lawfully
his
own
gathers
a
flower
with
a
poison
on
its
petals
that
whoso
revenges
strikes
with
a
sword
that
has
two
edges
one
for
his
adversary
one
for
himself
that
who
lives
to
himself
is
dead
though
the
ground
is
not
yet
on
him
that
who
wrongs
another
clouds
his
own
sun
and
that
who
sins
in
secret
stands
accursed
and
condemned
before
the
one
judge
who
deals
eternal
justice
his
own
self
experience
will
teach
us
this
and
reason
will
show
us
why
it
must
be
so
but
at
first
the
world
swings
before
our
eyes
and
no
voice
cries
out
this
is
the
way
walk
ye
in
it
you
are
happy
to
be
here
boy
when
the
suspense
fills
you
with
pain
you
build
stone
walls
and
dig
earth
for
relief
others
have
stood
where
you
stand
today
and
have
felt
as
you
feel
and
another
relief
has
been
offered
them
and
they
have
taken
it
when
the
day
has
come
when
they
have
seen
the
path
in
which
they
might
walk
they
have
not
the
strength
to
follow
it
habits
have
fastened
on
them
from
which
nothing
but
death
can
free
them
which
cling
closer
than
his
sacerdotal
sanctimony
to
a
priest
which
feed
on
the
intellect
like
a
worm
sapping
energy
hope
creative
power
all
that
makes
a
man
higher
than
a
beast
leaving
only
the
power
to
yearn
to
regret
and
to
sink
lower
in
the
abyss
boy
he
said
and
the
listener
was
not
more
unsmiling
now
than
the
speaker
you
are
happy
to
be
here
stay
where
you
are
if
you
ever
pray
let
it
be
only
the
one
old
prayer
lead
us
not
into
live
on
here
quietly
the
time
may
yet
come
when
you
will
be
that
which
other
men
have
hoped
to
be
and
never
will
be
the
stranger
rose
shook
the
dust
from
his
sleeve
and
ashamed
at
his
own
earnestness
looked
across
the
bushes
for
his
horse
we
should
have
been
on
our
way
already
he
said
we
shall
have
a
long
ride
in
the
dark
waldo
hastened
to
fetch
the
animal
but
he
returned
leading
it
slowly
the
sooner
it
came
the
sooner
would
its
rider
be
gone
the
stranger
was
opening
his
saddlebag
in
which
were
a
bright
french
novel
and
an
old
brown
volume
he
took
the
last
and
held
it
out
to
the
boy
it
may
be
of
some
help
to
you
he
said
carelessly
it
was
a
gospel
to
me
when
i
first
fell
on
it
you
must
not
expect
too
much
but
it
may
give
you
a
centre
round
which
to
hang
your
ideas
instead
of
letting
them
lie
about
in
a
confusion
that
makes
the
head
ache
we
of
this
generation
are
not
destined
to
eat
and
be
satisfied
as
our
fathers
were
we
must
be
content
to
go
he
smiled
his
automaton
smile
and
rebuttoned
the
bag
waldo
thrust
the
book
into
his
breast
and
while
he
saddled
the
horse
the
stranger
made
inquiries
as
to
the
nature
of
the
road
and
the
distance
to
the
next
farm
when
the
bags
were
fixed
waldo
took
up
his
wooden
post
and
began
to
fasten
it
on
to
the
saddle
tying
it
with
the
little
blue
cotton
handkerchief
from
his
neck
the
stranger
looked
on
in
silence
when
it
was
done
the
boy
held
the
stirrup
for
him
to
mount
what
is
your
name
he
inquired
ungloving
his
right
hand
when
he
was
in
the
saddle
the
boy
replied
well
i
trust
we
shall
meet
again
some
day
sooner
or
he
shook
hands
with
the
ungloved
hand
then
drew
on
the
glove
and
touched
his
horse
and
rode
slowly
away
the
boy
stood
to
watch
him
once
when
the
stranger
had
gone
half
across
the
plain
he
looked
back
poor
devil
he
said
smiling
and
stroking
his
moustache
then
he
looked
to
see
if
the
little
blue
handkerchief
were
still
safely
knotted
poor
devil
he
smiled
and
then
he
sighed
wearily
very
wearily
and
waldo
waited
till
the
moving
speck
had
disappeared
on
the
horizon
then
he
stooped
and
kissed
passionately
a
in
the
sand
then
he
called
his
young
birds
together
and
put
his
book
under
his
arm
and
walked
home
along
the
stone
wall
there
was
a
rare
beauty
to
him
in
the
sunshine
that
evening
chapter
gregory
rose
finds
his
affinity
the
new
man
gregory
rose
sat
at
the
door
of
his
dwelling
his
arms
folded
his
legs
crossed
and
a
profound
melancholy
seeming
to
rest
over
his
soul
his
house
was
a
little
square
building
far
out
in
the
karoo
two
miles
from
the
homestead
it
was
covered
outside
with
a
sombre
coating
of
brown
mud
two
little
panes
being
let
into
the
walls
for
windows
behind
it
were
the
and
to
the
right
a
large
dam
now
principally
containing
baked
mud
far
off
the
little
kopje
concealed
the
homestead
and
was
not
itself
an
object
conspicuous
enough
to
relieve
the
dreary
monotony
of
the
landscape
before
the
door
sat
gregory
rose
in
his
on
a
and
ever
and
anon
he
sighed
deeply
there
was
that
in
his
countenance
for
which
even
his
depressing
circumstances
failed
to
account
again
and
again
he
looked
at
the
little
kopje
at
the
at
his
side
and
at
the
brown
pony
who
a
short
way
off
cropped
the
dry
bushes
and
sighed
presently
he
rose
and
went
into
his
house
it
was
one
tiny
room
the
whitewashed
walls
profusely
covered
with
prints
cut
from
the
illustrated
london
news
and
in
which
there
was
a
noticeable
preponderance
of
female
faces
and
figures
a
stretcher
filled
one
end
of
the
hut
and
a
rack
for
a
gun
and
a
little
hanging
diversified
the
gable
opposite
while
in
the
centre
stood
a
chair
and
table
all
was
scrupulously
neat
and
clean
for
gregory
kept
a
little
duster
folded
in
the
corner
of
his
just
as
he
had
seen
his
mother
do
and
every
morning
before
he
went
out
he
said
his
prayers
and
made
his
bed
and
dusted
the
table
and
the
legs
of
the
chairs
and
even
the
pictures
on
the
wall
and
the
on
this
hot
afternoon
he
took
from
beneath
his
pillow
a
made
by
his
sister
jemima
and
took
out
the
watch
only
half
past
four
with
a
suppressed
groan
he
dropped
it
back
and
sat
down
beside
the
table
four
presently
he
roused
himself
he
would
write
to
his
sister
jemima
he
always
wrote
to
her
when
he
was
miserable
she
was
his
he
forgot
her
when
he
was
happy
but
he
used
her
when
he
was
wretched
he
took
out
ink
and
paper
there
was
a
family
crest
and
motto
on
the
latter
for
the
roses
since
coming
to
the
colony
had
discovered
that
they
were
of
distinguished
lineage
old
rose
himself
an
honest
english
farmer
knew
nothing
of
his
noble
descent
but
his
wife
and
daughter
knew
especially
his
daughter
there
were
roses
in
england
who
kept
a
park
and
dated
from
the
conquest
so
the
colonial
rose
farm
became
rose
manor
in
remembrance
of
the
ancestral
domain
and
the
claim
of
the
roses
to
noble
blood
was
established
in
their
own
minds
at
least
gregory
took
up
one
of
the
white
crested
sheets
but
on
deeper
reflection
he
determined
to
take
a
pink
one
as
more
suitable
to
the
state
of
his
feelings
he
began
kopje
alone
monday
afternoon
my
dear
jemima
then
he
looked
up
into
the
little
glass
opposite
it
was
a
youthful
face
reflected
there
with
curling
brown
beard
and
hair
but
in
the
dark
blue
eyes
there
was
a
look
of
languid
longing
that
touched
him
he
his
pen
and
wrote
when
i
look
up
into
the
little
glass
that
hangs
opposite
me
i
wonder
if
that
changed
and
sad
face
here
he
sat
still
and
reflected
it
sounded
almost
as
if
he
might
be
conceited
or
unmanly
to
be
looking
at
his
own
face
in
the
glass
no
that
would
not
do
so
he
looked
for
another
pink
sheet
and
began
again
kopje
alone
monday
afternoon
dear
sister
it
is
hardly
six
months
since
i
left
you
to
come
to
this
spot
yet
could
you
now
see
me
i
know
what
you
would
say
i
know
what
mother
would
say
can
that
be
our
greg
that
thing
with
the
strange
look
in
his
eyes
yes
jemima
it
is
your
greg
and
the
change
has
been
coming
over
me
ever
since
i
came
here
but
it
is
greatest
since
yesterday
you
know
what
sorrows
i
have
passed
through
jemima
how
unjustly
i
was
always
treated
at
school
the
masters
keeping
me
back
and
calling
me
a
blockhead
though
as
they
themselves
allowed
i
had
the
best
memory
of
any
boy
in
the
school
and
could
repeat
whole
books
from
beginning
to
end
you
know
how
cruelly
father
always
used
me
calling
me
a
noodle
and
a
milksop
just
because
he
couldn
t
understand
my
fine
nature
you
know
how
he
has
made
a
farmer
of
me
instead
of
a
minister
as
i
ought
to
have
been
you
know
it
all
jemima
and
how
i
have
borne
it
all
not
as
a
woman
who
whines
for
every
touch
but
as
a
man
should
in
silence
but
there
are
things
there
is
a
thing
which
the
soul
longs
to
pour
forth
into
a
kindred
ear
dear
sister
have
you
ever
known
what
it
is
to
keep
wanting
and
wanting
and
wanting
to
kiss
some
one
s
mouth
and
you
may
not
to
touch
some
one
s
hand
and
you
can
not
i
am
in
love
jemima
the
old
dutchwoman
from
whom
i
hire
this
place
has
a
little
stepdaughter
and
her
name
begins
with
e
she
is
english
i
do
not
know
how
her
father
came
to
marry
a
it
makes
me
feel
so
strange
to
put
down
that
letter
that
i
can
hardly
go
on
writing
e
i
ve
loved
her
ever
since
i
came
here
for
weeks
i
have
not
been
able
to
eat
or
drink
my
very
tobacco
when
i
smoke
has
no
taste
and
i
can
remain
for
no
more
than
five
minutes
in
one
place
and
sometimes
feel
as
though
i
were
really
going
mad
every
evening
i
go
there
to
fetch
my
milk
yesterday
she
gave
me
some
coffee
the
spoon
fell
on
the
ground
she
picked
it
up
when
she
gave
it
me
her
finger
touched
mine
jemima
i
do
not
know
if
i
fancied
it
i
shivered
hot
and
she
shivered
too
i
thought
it
is
all
right
she
will
be
mine
she
loves
me
just
then
jemima
in
came
a
fellow
a
great
coarse
fellow
a
german
a
ridiculous
fellow
with
curls
right
down
to
his
shoulders
it
makes
one
sick
to
look
at
him
he
s
only
a
servant
of
the
s
and
a
low
vulgar
uneducated
thing
that
s
never
been
to
in
his
life
he
had
been
to
the
next
farm
seeking
sheep
when
he
came
in
she
said
good
evening
waldo
have
some
coffee
and
she
kissed
him
all
last
night
i
heard
nothing
else
but
have
some
coffee
have
some
if
i
went
to
sleep
for
a
moment
i
dreamed
that
her
finger
was
pressing
mine
but
when
i
woke
with
a
start
i
heard
her
say
good
evening
waldo
have
some
coffee
is
this
madness
i
have
not
eaten
a
mouthful
today
this
evening
i
go
and
propose
to
her
if
she
refuses
me
i
shall
go
and
kill
myself
tomorrow
there
is
a
dam
of
water
close
by
the
sheep
have
drunk
most
of
it
up
but
there
is
still
enough
if
i
tie
a
stone
to
my
neck
it
is
a
choice
between
death
and
madness
i
can
endure
no
more
if
this
should
be
the
last
letter
you
ever
get
from
me
think
of
me
tenderly
and
forgive
me
without
her
life
would
be
a
howling
wilderness
a
long
tribulation
she
is
my
affinity
the
one
love
of
my
life
of
my
youth
of
my
manhood
my
sunshine
my
blossom
they
never
loved
who
dreamed
that
they
loved
once
and
who
saith
i
loved
once
not
angels
whose
deep
eyes
look
down
through
realms
of
light
your
disconsolate
brother
on
what
is
in
all
probability
the
last
and
distracted
night
of
his
life
gregory
nazianzen
rose
tell
mother
to
take
care
of
my
pearl
studs
i
left
them
in
the
drawer
don
t
let
the
children
get
hold
of
them
i
shall
take
this
letter
with
me
to
the
farm
if
i
turn
down
one
corner
you
may
know
i
have
been
accepted
if
not
you
may
know
it
is
all
up
with
your
heartbroken
brother
gregory
having
finished
this
letter
read
it
over
with
much
approval
put
it
in
an
envelope
addressed
it
and
sat
contemplating
the
inkpot
somewhat
relieved
in
mind
the
evening
turned
out
chilly
and
very
windy
after
the
day
s
heat
from
afar
off
as
gregory
neared
the
homestead
on
the
brown
pony
he
could
distinguish
a
little
figure
in
a
little
red
cloak
at
the
door
of
the
em
leaned
over
the
poles
that
barred
the
gate
and
watched
the
frothing
milk
run
through
the
black
fingers
of
the
herdsman
while
the
unwilling
cows
stood
with
tethered
heads
by
the
milking
poles
she
had
thrown
the
red
cloak
over
her
own
head
and
held
it
under
her
chin
with
a
little
hand
to
keep
from
her
ears
the
wind
that
playfully
shook
it
and
tossed
the
little
fringe
of
yellow
hair
into
her
eyes
is
it
not
too
cold
for
you
to
be
standing
here
said
gregory
coming
softly
close
to
her
oh
no
it
is
so
nice
i
always
come
to
watch
the
milking
that
red
cow
with
the
short
horns
is
bringing
up
the
calf
of
the
white
cow
that
died
she
loves
it
so
just
as
if
it
were
her
own
it
is
so
nice
to
see
her
lick
its
little
ears
just
look
the
clouds
are
black
i
think
it
is
going
to
rain
tonight
said
gregory
yes
answered
em
looking
up
as
well
as
she
could
for
the
little
yellow
fringe
but
i
m
sure
you
must
be
cold
said
gregory
and
put
his
hand
under
the
cloak
and
found
there
a
small
fist
doubled
up
soft
and
very
warm
he
held
it
fast
in
his
hand
oh
em
i
love
you
better
than
all
the
world
besides
tell
me
do
you
love
me
a
little
yes
i
do
said
em
hesitating
and
trying
softly
to
free
her
hand
better
than
everything
better
than
all
the
world
darling
he
asked
bending
down
so
low
that
the
yellow
hair
was
blown
into
his
eyes
i
don
t
know
said
em
gravely
i
do
love
you
very
much
but
i
love
my
cousin
who
is
at
school
and
waldo
very
much
you
see
i
have
known
them
so
long
oh
em
do
not
talk
to
me
so
coldly
gregory
cried
seizing
the
little
arm
that
rested
on
the
gate
and
pressing
it
till
she
was
half
afraid
the
herdsman
had
moved
away
to
the
other
end
of
the
kraal
now
and
the
cows
busy
with
their
calves
took
no
notice
of
the
little
human
farce
em
if
you
talk
so
to
me
i
will
go
mad
you
must
love
me
love
me
better
than
all
you
must
give
yourself
to
me
i
have
loved
you
since
that
first
moment
when
i
saw
you
walking
by
the
stone
wall
with
the
jug
in
your
hands
you
were
made
for
me
created
for
me
i
will
love
you
till
i
die
oh
em
do
not
be
so
cold
so
cruel
to
me
he
held
her
arm
so
tightly
that
her
fingers
relaxed
their
hold
and
the
cloak
fluttered
down
on
to
the
ground
and
the
wind
played
more
roughly
than
ever
with
the
little
yellow
head
i
do
love
you
very
much
she
said
but
i
do
not
know
if
i
want
to
marry
you
i
love
you
better
than
waldo
but
i
can
t
tell
if
i
love
you
better
than
lyndall
if
you
would
let
me
wait
for
a
week
i
think
perhaps
i
could
tell
gregory
picked
up
the
cloak
and
wrapped
it
round
her
if
you
could
but
love
me
as
i
love
you
he
said
but
no
woman
can
love
as
a
man
can
i
will
wait
till
saturday
i
will
not
once
come
near
you
till
then
oh
em
he
said
turning
again
and
twining
his
arm
about
her
and
kissing
her
surprised
little
mouth
if
you
are
not
my
wife
i
can
not
live
i
have
never
loved
another
woman
and
i
never
shall
never
never
you
make
me
afraid
said
em
come
let
us
go
and
i
will
fill
your
i
want
no
milk
you
will
not
see
me
again
till
late
that
night
when
every
one
else
had
gone
to
bed
the
little
woman
stood
alone
in
the
kitchen
she
had
come
to
fill
the
kettle
for
the
next
morning
s
coffee
and
now
stood
before
the
fire
the
warm
reflection
lit
the
grave
little
face
that
was
so
unusually
thoughtful
this
evening
better
than
all
the
world
better
than
everything
he
loves
me
better
than
everything
she
said
the
words
aloud
as
if
they
were
more
easy
to
believe
if
she
spoke
them
so
she
had
given
out
so
much
love
in
her
little
life
and
had
got
none
of
it
back
with
interest
now
one
said
i
love
you
better
than
all
the
one
loved
her
better
than
she
loved
him
how
suddenly
rich
she
was
she
kept
clasping
and
unclasping
her
hands
so
a
beggar
feels
who
falls
asleep
on
the
pavement
wet
and
hungry
and
who
wakes
in
a
with
servants
and
lights
and
a
feast
before
him
of
course
the
beggar
s
is
only
a
dream
and
he
wakes
from
it
and
this
was
real
gregory
had
said
to
her
i
will
love
you
as
long
as
i
she
said
the
words
over
and
over
to
herself
like
a
song
i
will
send
for
him
tomorrow
and
i
will
tell
him
how
i
love
him
back
she
said
but
em
needed
not
to
send
for
him
gregory
discovered
on
reaching
home
that
jemima
s
letter
was
still
in
his
pocket
and
therefore
much
as
he
disliked
the
appearance
of
vacillation
and
weakness
he
was
obliged
to
be
at
the
farmhouse
before
sunrise
to
post
it
if
i
see
her
gregory
said
i
shall
only
bow
to
her
she
shall
see
that
i
am
a
man
one
who
keeps
his
as
to
jemima
s
letter
he
had
turned
down
one
corner
of
the
page
and
then
turned
it
back
leaving
a
deep
crease
that
would
show
that
he
was
neither
accepted
nor
rejected
but
that
matters
were
in
an
intermediate
condition
it
was
a
more
poetical
way
then
putting
it
in
plain
words
gregory
was
barely
in
time
with
his
letter
for
waldo
was
starting
when
he
reached
the
homestead
and
em
was
on
the
doorstep
to
see
him
off
when
he
had
given
the
letter
and
waldo
had
gone
gregory
bowed
stiffly
and
prepared
to
remount
his
own
pony
but
somewhat
slowly
it
was
still
early
none
of
the
servants
were
about
em
came
up
close
to
him
and
put
her
little
hand
softly
on
his
arm
as
he
stood
by
his
horse
i
do
love
you
best
of
all
she
said
she
was
not
frightened
now
however
much
he
kissed
her
i
wish
i
was
beautiful
and
nice
she
added
looking
up
into
his
eyes
as
he
held
her
against
his
breast
my
darling
to
me
you
are
more
beautiful
than
all
the
women
in
the
world
dearer
to
me
than
everything
it
holds
if
you
were
in
hell
i
would
go
after
you
to
find
you
there
if
you
were
dead
though
my
body
moved
my
soul
would
be
under
the
ground
with
you
all
life
as
i
pass
with
you
in
my
arms
will
be
perfect
to
me
it
will
pass
pass
like
a
ray
of
em
thought
how
beautiful
and
grand
his
face
was
as
she
looked
up
into
it
she
raised
her
hand
gently
and
put
it
on
his
forehead
you
are
so
silent
so
cold
my
em
he
cried
have
you
nothing
to
say
to
me
a
little
shade
of
wonder
filled
her
eyes
i
will
do
everything
you
tell
me
she
said
what
else
could
she
say
her
idea
of
love
was
only
service
then
my
own
precious
one
promise
never
to
kiss
that
fellow
again
i
can
not
bear
that
you
should
love
any
one
but
me
you
must
not
i
will
not
have
it
if
every
relation
i
had
in
the
world
were
to
die
tomorrow
i
would
be
quite
happy
if
i
still
only
had
you
my
darling
my
love
why
are
you
so
cold
promise
me
not
to
love
him
any
more
if
you
asked
me
to
do
anything
for
you
i
would
do
it
though
it
cost
my
em
put
her
hand
very
gravely
round
his
neck
i
will
never
kiss
him
she
said
and
i
will
try
not
to
love
any
one
else
but
i
do
not
know
if
i
will
be
oh
my
darling
i
think
of
you
all
night
all
day
i
think
of
nothing
else
love
nothing
else
he
said
folding
his
arms
about
her
em
was
a
little
conscience
stricken
even
that
morning
she
had
found
time
to
remember
that
in
six
months
her
cousin
would
come
back
from
school
and
she
had
thought
to
remind
waldo
of
the
lozenges
for
his
cough
even
when
she
saw
gregory
coming
i
do
not
know
how
it
is
she
said
humbly
nestling
to
him
but
i
can
not
love
you
so
much
as
you
love
me
perhaps
it
is
because
i
am
only
a
woman
but
i
do
love
you
as
much
as
i
now
the
kaffer
maids
were
coming
from
the
huts
he
kissed
her
again
eyes
and
mouth
and
hands
and
left
her
tant
sannie
was
well
satisfied
when
told
of
the
betrothment
she
herself
contemplated
marriage
within
the
year
with
one
or
other
of
her
numerous
vrijers
and
she
suggested
that
the
weddings
might
take
place
together
em
set
to
work
busily
to
prepare
her
own
household
linen
and
wedding
garments
gregory
was
with
her
daily
almost
hourly
and
the
six
months
which
elapsed
before
lyndall
s
return
passed
as
he
felicitously
phrased
it
like
a
summer
night
when
you
are
dreaming
of
some
one
you
late
one
evening
gregory
sat
by
his
little
love
turning
the
handle
of
her
machine
as
she
drew
her
work
through
it
and
they
talked
of
the
changes
they
would
make
when
the
was
gone
and
the
farm
belonged
to
them
alone
there
should
be
a
new
room
here
and
a
kraal
there
so
they
chatted
on
suddenly
gregory
dropped
the
handle
and
impressed
a
fervent
kiss
on
the
fat
hand
that
guided
the
linen
you
are
so
beautiful
em
said
the
lover
it
comes
over
me
in
a
flood
suddenly
how
i
love
em
smiled
tant
sannie
says
when
i
am
her
age
no
one
will
look
at
me
and
it
is
true
my
hands
are
as
short
and
broad
as
a
duck
s
foot
and
my
forehead
is
so
low
and
i
haven
t
any
nose
i
can
t
be
she
laughed
softly
it
was
so
nice
to
think
he
should
be
so
blind
when
my
cousin
comes
tomorrow
you
will
see
a
beautiful
woman
gregory
she
added
presently
she
is
like
a
little
queen
her
shoulders
are
so
upright
and
her
head
looks
as
though
it
ought
to
have
a
little
crown
upon
it
you
must
come
to
see
her
tomorrow
as
soon
as
she
comes
i
am
sure
you
will
love
of
course
i
shall
come
to
see
her
since
she
is
your
cousin
but
do
you
think
i
could
ever
think
any
woman
as
lovely
as
i
think
you
he
fixed
his
seething
eyes
upon
her
you
could
not
help
seeing
that
she
is
prettier
said
em
slipping
her
right
hand
into
his
but
you
will
never
be
able
to
like
any
one
so
much
as
you
like
afterward
when
she
wished
her
lover
good
night
she
stood
upon
the
doorstep
to
call
a
greeting
after
him
and
she
waited
as
she
always
did
till
the
brown
pony
s
hoofs
became
inaudible
behind
the
kopje
then
she
passed
through
the
room
where
tant
sannie
lay
snoring
and
through
the
little
room
that
was
all
draped
in
white
waiting
for
her
cousin
s
return
on
to
her
own
room
she
went
to
the
chest
of
drawers
to
put
away
the
work
she
had
finished
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
before
the
lowest
drawer
in
it
were
the
things
she
was
preparing
for
her
marriage
piles
of
white
linen
and
some
aprons
and
quilts
and
in
a
little
box
in
the
corner
a
spray
of
which
she
had
bought
from
a
smouse
there
too
was
a
ring
gregory
had
given
her
and
a
veil
his
sister
had
sent
and
there
was
a
little
roll
of
fine
embroidered
work
which
trana
had
given
her
it
was
too
fine
and
good
even
for
gregory
s
wife
just
right
for
something
very
small
and
soft
she
would
keep
it
and
she
touched
it
gently
with
her
forefinger
smiling
and
then
she
blushed
and
hid
it
far
behind
the
other
things
she
knew
so
well
all
that
was
in
that
drawer
and
yet
she
turned
them
all
over
as
though
she
saw
them
for
the
first
time
packed
them
all
out
and
packed
them
all
in
without
one
fold
or
crumple
and
then
sat
down
and
looked
at
them
tomorrow
evening
when
lyndall
came
she
would
bring
her
here
and
show
it
her
all
lyndall
would
so
like
to
see
it
the
little
wreath
and
the
ring
and
the
white
veil
it
would
be
so
nice
then
em
fell
to
seeing
pictures
lyndall
should
live
with
them
till
she
herself
got
married
some
day
every
day
when
gregory
came
home
tired
from
his
work
he
would
look
about
and
say
where
is
my
wife
has
no
one
seen
my
wife
wife
some
coffee
and
she
would
give
him
some
em
s
little
face
grew
very
grave
at
last
and
she
knelt
up
and
extended
her
hands
over
the
drawer
of
linen
oh
god
she
said
i
am
so
glad
i
do
not
know
what
i
have
done
that
i
should
be
so
glad
thank
you
chapter
lyndall
she
was
more
like
a
princess
yes
far
more
like
a
princess
than
the
lady
who
still
hung
on
the
wall
in
tant
sannie
s
bedroom
so
em
thought
she
leaned
back
in
the
little
armchair
she
wore
a
grey
and
her
long
hair
was
combed
out
and
hung
to
the
ground
em
sitting
before
her
looked
up
with
mingled
respect
and
admiration
lyndall
was
tired
after
her
long
journey
and
had
come
to
her
room
early
her
eyes
ran
over
the
familiar
objects
strange
to
go
away
for
four
years
and
come
back
and
find
that
the
candle
standing
on
the
still
cast
the
shadow
of
an
old
crone
s
head
in
the
corner
beyond
the
strange
that
even
a
shadow
should
last
longer
than
a
man
she
looked
about
among
the
old
familiar
objects
all
was
there
but
the
old
self
was
gone
what
are
you
noticing
asked
em
nothing
and
everything
i
thought
the
windows
were
higher
if
i
were
you
when
i
get
this
place
i
should
raise
the
walls
there
is
not
room
to
breathe
here
one
gregory
is
going
to
make
many
alterations
said
em
and
drawing
nearer
to
the
grey
respectfully
do
you
like
him
lyndall
is
he
not
handsome
he
must
have
been
a
fine
baby
said
lyndall
looking
at
the
white
dimity
curtain
that
hung
above
the
window
em
was
puzzled
there
are
some
men
said
lyndall
whom
you
never
can
believe
were
babies
at
all
and
others
you
never
see
without
thinking
how
very
nice
they
must
have
looked
when
they
wore
socks
and
pink
em
remained
silent
then
she
said
with
a
little
dignity
when
you
know
him
you
will
love
him
as
i
do
when
i
compare
other
people
with
him
they
seem
so
weak
and
little
our
hearts
are
so
cold
our
loves
are
mixed
up
with
so
many
other
things
but
he
no
one
is
worthy
of
his
love
i
am
not
it
is
so
great
and
you
need
not
make
yourself
unhappy
on
that
point
your
poor
return
for
his
love
my
dear
said
lyndall
a
man
s
love
is
a
fire
of
it
leaps
higher
every
moment
it
roars
it
blazes
it
shoots
out
red
flames
it
threatens
to
wrap
you
round
and
devour
you
you
who
stand
by
like
an
icicle
in
the
glow
of
its
fierce
warmth
you
are
at
your
own
chilliness
and
want
of
reciprocity
the
next
day
when
you
go
to
warm
your
hands
a
little
you
find
a
few
ashes
tis
a
long
love
and
cool
against
a
short
love
and
hot
men
at
all
events
have
nothing
to
complain
you
speak
so
because
you
do
not
know
men
said
em
instantly
assuming
the
dignity
of
superior
knowledge
so
universally
affected
by
affianced
and
married
women
in
discussing
man
s
nature
with
their
uncontracted
sisters
you
will
know
them
too
some
day
and
then
you
will
think
differently
said
em
with
the
condescending
magnanimity
which
superior
knowledge
can
always
afford
to
show
to
ignorance
lyndall
s
little
lip
quivered
in
a
manner
indicative
of
intense
amusement
she
twirled
a
massive
ring
upon
her
forefinger
a
ring
more
suitable
for
the
hand
of
a
man
and
noticeable
in
design
a
diamond
cross
let
into
gold
with
the
initials
below
it
ah
lyndall
em
cried
perhaps
you
are
engaged
yourself
that
is
why
you
smile
yes
i
am
sure
you
are
look
at
this
ring
lyndall
drew
the
hand
quickly
from
her
i
am
not
in
so
great
a
hurry
to
put
my
neck
beneath
any
man
s
foot
and
i
do
not
so
greatly
admire
the
crying
of
babies
she
said
as
she
closed
her
eyes
half
wearily
and
leaned
back
in
the
chair
there
are
other
women
glad
of
such
em
felt
rebuked
and
ashamed
how
could
she
take
lyndall
and
show
her
the
white
linen
and
the
wreath
and
the
embroidery
she
was
quiet
for
a
little
while
and
then
began
to
talk
about
trana
and
the
old
till
she
saw
her
companion
was
weary
then
she
rose
and
left
her
for
the
night
but
after
em
was
gone
lyndall
sat
on
watching
the
old
crone
s
face
in
the
corner
and
with
a
weary
look
as
though
the
whole
world
s
weight
rested
on
these
frail
young
shoulders
the
next
morning
waldo
starting
off
before
breakfast
with
a
bag
of
mealies
slung
over
his
shoulder
to
feed
the
ostriches
heard
a
light
step
behind
him
wait
for
me
i
am
coming
with
you
said
lyndall
adding
as
she
came
up
to
him
if
i
had
not
gone
to
look
for
you
yesterday
you
would
not
have
come
to
greet
me
till
now
do
you
not
like
me
any
longer
waldo
yes
but
you
are
it
was
the
old
clumsy
hesitating
mode
of
speech
you
like
the
pinafores
better
she
said
quickly
she
wore
a
dress
of
a
simple
cotton
fabric
but
very
fashionably
made
and
on
her
head
was
a
broad
white
hat
to
waldo
she
seemed
superbly
attired
she
saw
it
my
dress
has
changed
a
little
she
said
and
i
also
but
not
to
you
hang
the
bag
over
your
other
shoulder
that
i
may
see
your
face
you
say
so
little
that
if
one
does
not
look
at
you
you
are
an
uncomprehended
waldo
changed
the
bag
and
they
walked
on
side
by
side
you
have
improved
she
said
do
you
know
that
i
have
sometimes
wished
to
see
you
while
i
was
away
not
often
but
still
they
were
at
the
gate
of
the
first
camp
now
waldo
threw
over
a
bag
of
mealies
and
they
walked
on
over
the
dewy
ground
have
you
learnt
much
he
asked
her
simply
remembering
how
she
had
once
said
when
i
come
back
again
i
shall
know
everything
that
a
human
being
she
laughed
are
you
thinking
of
my
old
boast
yes
i
have
learnt
something
though
hardly
what
i
expected
and
not
quite
so
much
in
the
first
place
i
have
learnt
that
one
of
my
ancestors
must
have
been
a
very
great
fool
for
they
say
nothing
comes
out
in
a
man
but
one
of
his
forefathers
possessed
it
before
him
in
the
second
place
i
have
discovered
that
of
all
cursed
places
under
the
sun
where
the
hungriest
soul
can
hardly
pick
up
a
few
grains
of
knowledge
a
girls
is
the
worst
they
are
called
finishing
schools
and
the
name
tells
accurately
what
they
are
they
finish
everything
but
imbecility
and
weakness
and
that
they
cultivate
they
are
nicely
adapted
machines
for
experimenting
on
the
question
into
how
little
space
a
human
soul
can
be
crushed
i
have
seen
some
souls
so
compressed
that
they
would
have
fitted
into
a
small
thimble
and
found
room
to
move
there
wide
room
a
woman
who
has
been
for
many
years
in
one
of
those
places
carries
the
mark
of
the
beast
on
her
till
she
dies
though
she
may
expand
a
little
afterward
when
she
breathes
in
the
free
were
you
miserable
he
asked
looking
at
her
with
quick
anxiety
i
no
i
am
never
miserable
and
never
happy
i
wish
i
were
but
i
should
have
run
away
from
the
place
on
the
fourth
day
and
hired
myself
to
the
first
whose
farm
i
came
to
to
make
fire
under
her
if
i
had
to
live
as
the
rest
of
the
drove
did
can
you
form
an
idea
waldo
of
what
it
must
be
to
be
shut
up
with
cackling
old
women
who
are
without
knowledge
of
life
without
love
of
the
beautiful
without
strength
to
have
your
soul
cultured
by
them
it
is
suffocation
only
to
breathe
the
air
they
breathe
but
i
made
them
give
me
room
i
told
them
i
should
leave
and
they
knew
i
came
there
on
my
own
account
so
they
gave
me
a
bedroom
without
the
companionship
of
one
of
those
things
that
were
having
their
brains
slowly
diluted
and
squeezed
out
of
them
i
did
not
learn
music
because
i
had
no
talent
and
when
the
drove
made
cushions
and
hideous
flowers
that
the
roses
laugh
at
and
a
footstool
in
six
weeks
that
a
machine
would
have
made
better
in
five
minutes
i
went
to
my
room
with
the
money
saved
from
such
work
i
bought
books
and
newspapers
and
at
night
i
sat
up
i
read
and
epitomized
what
i
read
and
i
found
time
to
write
some
plays
and
find
out
how
hard
it
is
to
make
your
thoughts
look
anything
but
imbecile
fools
when
you
paint
them
with
ink
and
paper
in
the
holidays
i
learnt
a
great
deal
more
i
made
acquaintances
saw
a
few
places
and
many
people
and
some
different
ways
of
living
which
is
more
than
any
books
can
show
one
on
the
whole
i
am
not
dissatisfied
with
my
four
years
i
have
not
learnt
what
i
expected
but
i
have
learnt
something
else
what
have
you
been
doing
that
is
not
possible
i
shall
find
out
by
and
they
still
stepped
on
side
by
side
over
the
dewy
bushes
then
suddenly
she
turned
on
him
don
t
you
wish
you
were
a
woman
waldo
no
he
answered
readily
she
laughed
i
thought
not
even
you
are
too
for
that
i
never
met
a
man
who
did
this
is
a
pretty
ring
she
said
holding
out
her
little
hand
that
the
morning
sun
might
make
the
diamonds
sparkle
worth
fifty
pounds
at
least
i
will
give
it
to
the
first
man
who
tells
me
he
would
like
to
be
a
woman
there
might
be
one
on
robbin
island
lunatics
at
the
cape
are
sent
to
robbin
island
who
would
win
it
perhaps
but
i
doubt
it
even
there
it
is
delightful
to
be
a
woman
but
every
man
thanks
the
lord
devoutly
that
he
isn
t
she
drew
her
hat
to
one
side
to
keep
the
sun
out
of
her
eyes
as
she
walked
waldo
looked
at
her
so
intently
that
he
stumbled
over
the
bushes
yes
this
was
his
little
lyndall
who
had
worn
the
check
pinafores
he
saw
it
now
and
he
walked
closer
beside
her
they
reached
the
next
camp
let
us
wait
at
this
camp
and
watch
the
birds
she
said
as
an
ostrich
hen
came
bounding
toward
them
with
velvety
wings
outstretched
while
far
away
over
the
bushes
the
head
of
the
cock
was
visible
as
he
sat
brooding
on
the
eggs
lyndall
folded
her
arms
on
the
gate
bar
and
waldo
threw
his
empty
bag
on
the
wall
and
leaned
beside
her
i
like
these
birds
she
said
they
share
each
other
s
work
and
are
companions
do
you
take
an
interest
in
the
position
of
women
waldo
i
thought
not
no
one
does
unless
they
are
in
need
of
a
subject
upon
which
to
show
their
wit
and
as
for
you
from
of
old
you
can
see
nothing
that
is
not
separated
from
you
by
a
few
millions
of
miles
and
strewed
over
with
mystery
if
women
were
the
inhabitants
of
jupiter
of
whom
you
had
happened
to
hear
something
you
would
pore
over
us
and
our
condition
night
and
day
but
because
we
are
before
your
eyes
you
never
look
at
us
you
care
nothing
that
this
is
ragged
and
ugly
she
said
putting
her
little
finger
on
his
sleeve
but
you
strive
mightily
to
make
an
imaginary
leaf
on
an
old
stick
beautiful
i
m
sorry
you
don
t
care
for
the
position
of
women
i
should
have
liked
us
to
be
friends
and
it
is
the
only
thing
about
which
i
think
much
or
feel
much
if
indeed
i
have
any
feeling
about
anything
she
added
flippantly
readjusting
her
dainty
little
arms
when
i
was
a
baby
i
fancy
my
parents
left
me
out
in
the
frost
one
night
and
i
got
nipped
internally
it
feels
so
i
have
only
a
few
old
thoughts
he
said
and
i
think
them
over
and
over
again
always
beginning
where
i
left
off
i
never
get
any
further
i
am
weary
of
like
an
old
hen
that
sits
on
its
eggs
month
after
month
and
they
never
come
out
she
said
quickly
i
am
so
pressed
in
upon
by
new
things
that
lest
they
should
trip
one
another
up
i
have
to
keep
forcing
them
back
my
head
swings
sometimes
but
this
one
thought
stands
never
goes
if
i
might
but
be
one
of
these
born
in
the
future
then
perhaps
to
be
born
a
woman
will
not
be
to
be
born
waldo
looked
at
her
it
was
hard
to
say
whether
she
were
in
earnest
or
mocking
i
know
it
is
foolish
wisdom
never
kicks
at
the
iron
walls
it
can
t
bring
down
she
said
but
we
are
cursed
waldo
born
cursed
from
the
time
our
mothers
bring
us
into
the
world
till
the
shrouds
are
put
on
us
do
not
look
at
me
as
though
i
were
talking
nonsense
everything
has
two
sides
the
outside
that
is
ridiculous
and
the
inside
that
is
i
am
not
laughing
said
the
boy
sedately
enough
but
what
curses
you
he
thought
she
would
not
reply
to
him
she
waited
so
long
it
is
not
what
is
done
to
us
but
what
is
made
of
us
she
said
at
last
that
wrongs
us
no
man
can
be
really
injured
but
by
what
modifies
himself
we
all
enter
the
world
little
plastic
beings
with
so
much
natural
force
perhaps
but
for
the
rest
blank
and
the
world
tells
us
what
we
are
to
be
and
shapes
us
by
the
ends
it
sets
before
us
to
you
it
says
work
and
to
us
it
says
seem
to
you
it
says
as
you
approximate
to
man
s
highest
ideal
of
god
as
your
arm
is
strong
and
your
knowledge
great
and
the
power
to
labour
is
with
you
so
you
shall
gain
all
that
human
heart
desires
to
us
it
says
strength
shall
not
help
you
nor
knowledge
nor
labour
you
shall
gain
what
men
gain
but
by
other
means
and
so
the
world
makes
men
and
women
look
at
this
little
chin
of
mine
waldo
with
the
dimple
in
it
it
is
but
a
small
part
of
my
person
but
though
i
had
a
knowledge
of
all
things
under
the
sun
and
the
wisdom
to
use
it
and
the
deep
loving
heart
of
an
angel
it
would
not
stead
me
through
life
like
this
little
chin
i
can
win
money
with
it
i
can
win
love
i
can
win
power
with
it
i
can
win
fame
what
would
knowledge
help
me
the
less
a
woman
has
in
her
head
the
lighter
she
is
for
climbing
i
once
heard
an
old
man
say
that
he
never
saw
intellect
help
a
woman
so
much
as
a
pretty
ankle
and
it
was
the
truth
they
begin
to
shape
us
to
our
cursed
end
she
said
with
her
lips
drawn
in
to
look
as
though
they
smiled
when
we
are
tiny
things
in
shoes
and
socks
we
sit
with
our
little
feet
drawn
up
under
us
in
the
window
and
look
out
at
the
boys
in
their
happy
play
we
want
to
go
then
a
loving
hand
is
laid
on
us
little
one
you
can
not
go
they
say
your
little
face
will
burn
and
your
nice
white
dress
be
we
feel
it
must
be
for
our
good
it
is
so
lovingly
said
but
we
can
not
understand
and
we
kneel
still
with
one
little
cheek
wistfully
pressed
against
the
pane
afterwards
we
go
and
thread
blue
beads
and
make
a
string
for
our
neck
and
we
go
and
stand
before
the
glass
we
see
the
complexion
we
were
not
to
spoil
and
the
white
frock
and
we
look
into
our
own
great
eyes
then
the
curse
begins
to
act
on
us
it
finishes
its
work
when
we
are
grown
women
who
no
more
look
out
wistfully
at
a
more
healthy
life
we
are
contented
we
fit
our
sphere
as
a
chinese
woman
s
foot
fits
her
shoe
exactly
as
though
god
had
made
both
and
yet
he
knows
nothing
of
either
in
some
of
us
the
shaping
of
our
end
has
been
quite
completed
the
parts
we
are
not
to
use
have
been
quite
atrophied
and
have
even
dropped
off
but
in
others
and
we
are
not
less
to
be
pitied
they
have
been
weakened
and
left
we
wear
the
bandages
but
our
limbs
have
not
grown
to
them
we
know
that
we
are
compressed
and
chafe
against
them
but
what
does
it
help
a
little
bitterness
a
little
longing
when
we
are
young
a
little
futile
searching
for
work
a
little
passionate
striving
for
room
for
the
exercise
of
our
powers
and
then
we
go
with
the
drove
a
woman
must
march
with
her
regiment
in
the
end
she
must
be
trodden
down
or
go
with
it
and
if
she
is
wise
she
goes
i
see
in
your
great
eyes
what
you
are
thinking
she
said
glancing
at
him
i
always
know
what
the
person
i
am
talking
to
is
thinking
of
how
is
this
woman
who
makes
such
a
fuss
worse
off
than
i
i
will
show
you
by
a
very
little
example
we
stand
here
at
this
gate
this
morning
both
poor
both
young
both
friendless
there
is
not
much
to
choose
between
us
let
us
turn
away
just
as
we
are
to
make
our
way
in
life
this
evening
you
will
come
to
a
farmer
s
house
the
farmer
albeit
you
come
alone
on
foot
will
give
you
a
pipe
of
tobacco
and
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
bed
if
he
has
no
dam
to
build
and
no
child
to
teach
tomorrow
you
can
go
on
your
way
with
a
friendly
greeting
of
the
hand
i
if
i
come
to
the
same
place
tonight
will
have
strange
questions
asked
me
strange
glances
cast
on
me
the
will
shake
her
head
and
give
me
food
to
eat
with
the
kaffers
and
a
right
to
sleep
with
the
dogs
that
would
be
the
first
step
in
our
progress
a
very
little
one
but
every
step
to
the
end
would
repeat
it
we
were
equals
once
when
we
lay
babes
on
our
nurses
knees
we
will
be
equals
again
when
they
tie
up
our
jaws
for
the
last
sleep
waldo
looked
in
wonder
at
the
little
quivering
face
it
was
a
glimpse
into
a
world
of
passion
and
feeling
wholly
new
to
him
mark
you
she
said
we
have
always
this
advantage
over
you
we
can
at
any
time
step
into
ease
and
competence
where
you
must
labour
patiently
for
it
a
little
weeping
a
little
wheedling
a
little
a
little
careful
use
of
our
advantages
and
then
some
man
will
say
come
be
my
wife
with
good
looks
and
youth
marriage
is
easy
to
attain
there
are
men
enough
but
a
woman
who
has
sold
herself
even
for
a
ring
and
a
new
name
need
hold
her
skirt
aside
for
no
creature
in
the
street
they
both
earn
their
bread
in
one
way
marriage
for
love
is
the
beautifulest
external
symbol
of
the
union
of
souls
marriage
without
it
is
the
uncleanliest
traffic
that
defiles
the
she
ran
her
little
finger
savagely
along
the
topmost
bar
shaking
off
the
dozen
little
dewdrops
that
still
hung
there
and
they
tell
us
we
have
men
s
chivalrous
attention
she
cried
when
we
ask
to
be
doctors
lawyers
anything
but
drudges
they
say
no
but
you
have
men
s
chivalrous
attention
now
think
of
that
and
be
satisfied
what
would
you
do
without
it
the
bitter
little
silvery
laugh
so
seldom
heard
rang
out
across
the
bushes
she
bit
her
little
teeth
together
i
was
coming
up
in
cobb
s
the
other
day
at
a
little
wayside
hotel
we
had
to
change
the
large
coach
for
a
small
one
we
were
ten
passengers
eight
men
and
two
women
as
i
sat
in
the
house
the
gentlemen
came
and
whispered
to
me
there
is
not
room
for
all
in
the
new
coach
take
your
seat
we
hurried
out
and
they
gave
me
the
best
seat
and
covered
me
with
rugs
because
it
was
drizzling
then
the
last
passenger
came
running
up
to
the
coach
an
old
woman
with
a
wonderful
bonnet
and
a
black
shawl
pinned
with
a
yellow
pin
there
is
no
room
they
said
you
must
wait
till
next
week
s
coach
takes
you
up
but
she
climbed
on
to
the
step
and
held
on
at
the
window
with
both
hands
my
is
ill
and
i
must
go
and
see
him
she
said
my
good
woman
said
one
i
am
really
exceedingly
sorry
that
your
is
ill
but
there
is
absolutely
no
room
for
you
you
had
better
get
down
said
another
or
the
wheel
will
catch
i
got
up
to
give
her
my
place
oh
no
no
they
cried
we
will
not
allow
i
will
rather
kneel
said
one
and
he
crouched
down
at
my
feet
so
the
woman
came
in
there
were
nine
of
us
in
that
coach
and
only
one
showed
chivalrous
attention
and
that
was
a
woman
to
a
woman
i
shall
be
old
and
ugly
too
one
day
and
i
shall
look
for
men
s
chivalrous
help
but
i
shall
not
find
it
the
bees
are
very
attentive
to
the
flowers
till
their
honey
is
done
and
then
they
fly
over
them
i
don
t
know
if
the
flowers
feel
grateful
to
the
bees
they
are
great
fools
if
they
but
some
women
said
waldo
speaking
as
though
the
words
forced
themselves
from
him
at
that
moment
some
women
have
she
lifted
her
beautiful
eyes
to
his
face
power
did
you
ever
hear
of
men
being
asked
whether
other
souls
should
have
power
or
not
it
is
born
in
them
you
may
dam
up
the
fountain
of
water
and
make
it
a
stagnant
marsh
or
you
may
let
it
run
free
and
do
its
work
but
you
can
not
say
whether
it
shall
be
there
it
is
there
and
it
will
act
if
not
openly
for
good
then
covertly
for
evil
but
it
will
act
if
goethe
had
been
stolen
away
a
child
and
reared
in
a
robber
horde
in
the
depths
of
a
german
forest
do
you
think
the
world
would
have
had
faust
and
iphegenie
but
he
would
have
been
goethe
still
stronger
wiser
than
his
fellows
at
night
round
their
he
would
have
chanted
wild
songs
of
rapine
and
murder
till
the
dark
faces
about
him
were
moved
and
trembled
his
songs
would
have
echoed
on
from
father
to
son
and
nerved
the
heart
and
arm
for
evil
do
you
think
if
napoleon
had
been
born
a
woman
that
he
would
have
been
contented
to
give
small
and
talk
small
scandal
he
would
have
risen
but
the
world
would
not
have
heard
of
him
as
it
hears
of
him
now
a
man
great
and
kingly
with
all
his
sins
he
would
have
left
one
of
those
names
that
stain
the
leaf
of
every
history
the
names
of
women
who
having
power
but
being
denied
the
right
to
exercise
it
openly
rule
in
the
dark
covertly
and
by
stealth
through
the
men
whose
passions
they
feed
on
and
by
whom
they
climb
power
she
said
suddenly
smiting
her
little
hand
upon
the
rail
yes
we
have
power
and
since
we
are
not
to
expend
it
in
tunnelling
mountains
nor
healing
diseases
nor
making
laws
nor
money
nor
on
any
extraneous
object
we
expend
it
on
you
you
are
our
goods
our
merchandise
our
material
for
operating
on
we
buy
you
we
sell
you
we
make
fools
of
you
we
act
the
wily
old
jew
with
you
we
keep
six
of
you
crawling
to
our
little
feet
and
praying
only
for
a
touch
of
our
little
hand
and
they
say
truly
there
was
never
an
ache
or
pain
or
broken
heart
but
a
woman
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
we
are
not
to
study
law
nor
science
nor
art
so
we
study
you
there
is
never
a
nerve
or
fibre
in
a
man
s
nature
but
we
know
it
we
keep
six
of
you
dancing
in
the
palm
of
one
little
hand
she
said
balancing
her
outstretched
arm
gracefully
as
though
tiny
beings
disported
themselves
in
its
palm
there
we
throw
you
away
and
you
sink
to
the
devil
she
said
folding
her
arms
composedly
there
was
never
a
man
who
said
one
word
for
woman
but
he
said
two
for
man
and
three
for
the
whole
human
she
watched
the
bird
pecking
up
the
last
yellow
grains
but
waldo
looked
only
at
her
when
she
spoke
again
it
was
very
measuredly
they
bring
weighty
arguments
against
us
when
we
ask
for
the
perfect
freedom
of
women
she
said
but
when
you
come
to
the
objections
they
are
like
pumpkin
devils
with
candles
inside
hollow
and
can
t
bite
they
say
that
women
do
not
wish
for
the
sphere
and
freedom
we
ask
for
them
and
would
not
use
it
if
the
bird
does
like
its
cage
and
does
like
its
sugar
and
will
not
leave
it
why
keep
the
door
so
very
carefully
shut
why
not
open
it
only
a
little
do
they
know
there
is
many
a
bird
will
not
break
its
wings
against
the
bars
but
would
fly
if
the
doors
were
open
she
knit
her
forehead
and
leaned
further
over
the
bars
then
they
say
if
the
women
have
the
liberty
you
ask
for
they
will
be
found
in
positions
for
which
they
are
not
fitted
if
two
men
climb
one
ladder
did
you
ever
see
the
weakest
anywhere
but
at
the
foot
the
surest
sign
of
fitness
is
success
the
weakest
never
wins
but
where
there
is
handicapping
nature
left
to
herself
will
as
beautifully
apportion
a
man
s
work
to
his
capacities
as
long
ages
ago
she
graduated
the
colours
on
the
bird
s
breast
if
we
are
not
fit
you
give
us
to
no
purpose
the
right
to
labour
the
work
will
fall
out
of
our
hands
into
those
that
are
she
talked
more
rapidly
as
she
went
on
as
one
talks
of
that
over
which
they
have
brooded
long
and
which
lies
near
their
hearts
waldo
watched
her
intently
they
say
women
have
one
great
and
noble
work
left
them
and
they
do
it
that
is
true
they
do
it
execrably
it
is
the
work
that
demands
the
broadest
culture
and
they
have
not
even
the
narrowest
the
lawyer
may
see
no
deeper
than
his
and
the
chemist
see
no
further
than
the
windows
of
his
laboratory
and
they
may
do
their
work
well
but
the
woman
who
does
woman
s
work
needs
a
multiform
culture
the
heights
and
depths
of
human
life
must
not
be
beyond
the
reach
of
her
vision
she
must
have
knowledge
of
men
and
things
in
many
states
a
wide
catholicity
of
sympathy
the
strength
that
springs
from
knowledge
and
the
magnanimity
which
springs
from
strength
we
bear
the
world
and
we
make
it
the
souls
of
little
children
are
marvellously
delicate
and
tender
things
and
keep
forever
the
shadow
that
first
falls
on
them
and
that
is
the
mother
s
or
at
best
a
woman
s
there
was
never
a
great
man
who
had
not
a
great
mother
it
is
hardly
an
exaggeration
the
first
six
years
of
our
life
make
us
all
that
is
added
later
is
veneer
and
yet
some
say
if
a
woman
can
cook
a
dinner
or
dress
herself
well
she
has
culture
enough
the
mightiest
and
noblest
of
human
work
is
given
to
us
and
we
do
it
ill
send
a
navvie
to
work
into
an
artist
s
studio
and
see
what
you
will
find
there
and
yet
thank
god
we
have
this
work
she
added
quickly
it
is
the
one
window
through
which
we
see
into
the
great
world
of
earnest
labour
the
meanest
girl
who
dances
and
dresses
becomes
something
higher
when
her
children
look
up
into
her
face
and
ask
her
questions
it
is
the
only
education
we
have
and
which
they
can
not
take
from
she
smiled
slightly
they
say
that
we
complain
of
woman
s
being
compelled
to
look
upon
marriage
as
a
profession
but
that
she
is
free
to
enter
upon
it
or
leave
it
as
she
pleases
yes
and
a
cat
set
afloat
in
a
pond
is
free
to
sit
in
the
tub
till
it
dies
there
it
is
under
no
obligation
to
wet
its
feet
and
a
drowning
man
may
catch
at
a
straw
or
not
just
as
he
likes
it
is
a
glorious
liberty
let
any
man
think
for
five
minutes
of
what
old
maidenhood
means
to
a
woman
and
then
let
him
be
silent
is
it
easy
to
bear
through
life
a
name
that
in
itself
signifies
defeat
to
dwell
as
nine
out
of
ten
unmarried
women
must
under
the
finger
of
another
woman
is
it
easy
to
look
forward
to
an
old
age
without
honour
without
the
reward
of
useful
labour
without
love
i
wonder
how
many
men
there
are
who
would
give
up
everything
that
is
dear
in
life
for
the
sake
of
maintaining
a
high
ideal
she
laughed
a
little
laugh
that
was
clear
without
being
pleasant
and
then
when
they
have
no
other
argument
against
us
they
say
go
on
but
when
you
have
made
woman
what
you
wish
and
her
children
inherit
her
culture
you
will
defeat
yourself
man
will
gradually
become
extinct
from
excess
of
intellect
the
passions
which
replenish
the
race
will
fools
she
said
curling
her
pretty
lip
a
hottentot
sits
at
the
roadside
and
feeds
on
a
rotten
bone
he
has
found
there
and
takes
out
his
bottle
of
and
swills
at
it
and
grunts
with
satisfaction
and
the
cultured
child
of
the
nineteenth
century
sits
in
his
armchair
and
sips
choice
wines
with
the
lip
of
a
connoisseur
and
tastes
delicate
dishes
with
a
delicate
palate
and
with
a
satisfaction
of
which
the
hottentot
knows
nothing
heavy
jaw
and
sloping
forehead
all
have
gone
with
increasing
intellect
but
the
animal
appetites
are
there
still
refined
discriminative
but
immeasurably
intensified
fools
before
men
forgave
or
worshipped
while
they
were
weak
on
their
hind
legs
did
they
not
eat
and
drink
and
fight
for
wives
when
all
the
latter
additions
to
humanity
have
vanished
will
not
the
foundation
on
which
they
are
built
remain
she
was
silent
then
for
a
while
and
said
somewhat
dreamily
more
as
though
speaking
to
herself
than
to
him
they
ask
what
will
you
gain
even
if
man
does
not
become
extinct
you
will
have
brought
justice
and
equality
on
to
the
earth
and
sent
love
from
it
when
men
and
women
are
equals
they
will
love
no
more
your
women
will
not
be
lovable
will
not
love
do
they
see
nothing
understand
nothing
it
is
tant
sannie
who
buries
husbands
one
after
another
and
folds
her
hands
resignedly
the
lord
gave
and
the
lord
hath
taken
away
and
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
lord
and
she
looks
for
another
it
is
the
deep
thinker
who
when
the
wife
who
has
thought
and
worked
with
him
goes
can
find
no
rest
and
lingers
near
her
till
he
finds
sleep
beside
her
a
great
soul
draws
and
is
drawn
with
a
more
fierce
intensity
than
any
small
one
by
every
inch
we
grow
in
intellectual
height
our
love
strikes
down
its
roots
deeper
and
spreads
out
its
arms
wider
it
is
for
love
s
sake
yet
more
than
for
any
other
that
we
look
for
that
new
she
had
leaned
her
head
against
the
stones
and
watched
with
her
sad
soft
eyes
the
retreating
bird
then
when
that
time
comes
she
said
lowly
when
love
is
no
more
bought
or
sold
when
it
is
not
a
means
of
making
bread
when
each
woman
s
life
is
filled
with
earnest
independent
labour
then
love
will
come
to
her
a
strange
sudden
sweetness
breaking
in
upon
her
earnest
work
not
sought
for
but
found
then
but
not
now
waldo
waited
for
her
to
finish
the
sentence
but
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
him
lyndall
he
said
putting
his
hand
upon
her
she
started
if
you
think
that
that
new
time
will
be
so
great
so
good
you
who
speak
so
easily
she
interrupted
him
speak
speak
she
said
the
difficulty
is
not
to
speak
the
difficulty
is
to
keep
but
why
do
you
not
try
to
bring
that
time
he
said
with
pitiful
simplicity
when
you
speak
i
believe
all
you
say
other
people
would
listen
to
you
i
am
not
so
sure
of
that
she
said
with
a
smile
then
over
the
small
face
came
the
weary
look
it
had
worn
last
night
as
it
watched
the
shadow
in
the
corner
ah
so
weary
i
waldo
i
she
said
i
will
do
nothing
good
for
myself
nothing
for
the
world
till
some
one
wakes
me
i
am
asleep
swathed
shut
up
in
self
till
i
have
been
delivered
i
will
deliver
no
he
looked
at
her
wondering
but
she
was
not
looking
at
him
to
see
the
good
and
the
beautiful
she
said
and
to
have
no
strength
to
live
it
is
only
to
be
moses
on
the
mountain
of
nebo
with
the
land
at
your
feet
and
no
power
to
enter
it
would
be
better
not
to
see
it
come
she
said
looking
up
into
his
face
and
seeing
its
uncomprehending
expression
let
us
go
it
is
getting
late
doss
is
anxious
for
his
breakfast
also
she
added
wheeling
round
and
calling
to
the
dog
who
was
endeavouring
to
unearth
a
mole
an
occupation
to
which
he
had
been
zealously
addicted
from
the
third
month
but
in
which
he
had
never
on
any
single
occasion
proved
successful
waldo
shouldered
his
bag
and
lyndall
walked
on
before
in
silence
with
the
dog
close
to
her
side
perhaps
she
thought
of
the
narrowness
of
the
limits
within
which
a
human
soul
may
speak
and
be
understood
by
its
nearest
of
mental
kin
of
how
soon
it
reaches
that
solitary
land
of
the
individual
experience
in
which
no
fellow
footfall
is
ever
heard
whatever
her
thoughts
may
have
been
she
was
soon
interrupted
waldo
came
close
to
her
and
standing
still
produced
with
awkwardness
from
his
a
small
carved
box
i
made
it
for
you
he
said
holding
it
out
i
like
it
she
said
examining
it
carefully
the
workmanship
was
better
than
that
of
the
the
flowers
that
covered
it
were
delicate
and
here
and
there
small
conical
protuberances
were
let
in
among
them
she
turned
it
round
critically
waldo
bent
over
it
lovingly
there
is
one
strange
thing
about
it
he
said
earnestly
putting
a
finger
on
one
little
pyramid
i
made
it
without
these
and
i
felt
something
was
wrong
i
tried
many
changes
and
at
last
i
let
these
in
and
then
it
was
right
but
why
was
it
they
are
not
beautiful
in
they
relieve
the
monotony
of
the
smooth
leaves
i
he
shook
his
head
as
over
a
weighty
matter
the
sky
is
monotonous
he
said
when
it
is
blue
and
yet
it
is
beautiful
i
have
thought
of
that
often
but
it
is
not
monotony
and
it
is
not
variety
makes
beauty
what
is
it
the
sky
and
your
face
and
this
box
the
same
thing
is
in
them
all
only
more
in
the
sky
and
in
your
face
but
what
is
it
she
smiled
so
you
are
at
your
old
work
still
why
why
why
what
is
the
reason
it
is
enough
for
me
she
said
if
i
find
out
what
is
beautiful
and
what
is
ugly
what
is
real
and
what
is
not
why
it
is
there
and
over
the
final
cause
of
things
in
general
i
don
t
trouble
myself
there
must
be
one
but
what
is
it
to
me
if
i
howl
to
all
eternity
i
shall
never
get
hold
of
it
and
if
i
did
i
might
be
no
better
off
but
you
germans
are
born
with
an
aptitude
for
borrowing
you
can
t
help
yourselves
you
must
sniff
after
reasons
just
as
that
dog
must
after
a
mole
he
knows
perfectly
well
he
will
never
catch
it
but
he
s
under
the
imperative
necessity
of
digging
for
but
he
might
find
might
but
he
never
has
and
never
will
life
is
too
short
to
run
after
mights
we
must
have
she
tucked
the
box
under
her
arm
and
was
about
to
walk
on
when
gregory
rose
with
shining
spurs
an
ostrich
feather
in
his
hat
and
a
whip
careered
past
he
bowed
gallantly
as
he
went
by
they
waited
till
the
dust
of
the
horse
s
hoofs
had
laid
itself
there
said
lyndall
goes
a
true
woman
one
born
for
the
sphere
that
some
women
have
to
fill
without
being
born
for
it
how
happy
he
would
be
sewing
frills
into
his
little
girl
s
frocks
and
how
pretty
he
would
look
sitting
in
a
parlour
with
a
rough
man
making
love
to
him
don
t
you
think
so
i
shall
not
stay
here
when
he
is
master
waldo
answered
not
able
to
connect
any
kind
of
beauty
with
gregory
rose
i
should
imagine
not
the
rule
of
a
woman
is
tyranny
but
the
rule
of
a
grinds
fine
where
are
you
going
what
to
do
see
see
you
will
be
and
were
you
yes
and
you
will
be
more
so
i
want
things
that
men
and
the
world
give
you
do
not
if
you
have
a
few
yards
of
earth
to
stand
on
and
a
bit
of
blue
over
you
and
something
that
you
can
not
see
to
dream
about
you
have
all
that
you
need
all
that
you
know
how
to
use
but
i
like
to
see
real
men
let
them
be
as
disagreeable
as
they
please
they
are
more
interesting
to
me
than
flowers
or
trees
or
stars
or
any
other
thing
under
the
sun
sometimes
she
added
walking
on
and
shaking
the
dust
daintily
from
her
skirts
when
i
am
not
too
busy
trying
to
find
a
new
way
of
doing
my
hair
that
will
show
my
little
neck
to
better
advantage
or
over
other
work
of
that
kind
sometimes
it
amuses
me
intensely
to
trace
out
the
resemblance
between
one
man
and
another
to
see
how
tant
sannie
and
i
you
and
bonaparte
simon
on
his
pillow
and
the
emperor
dining
off
larks
tongues
are
one
and
the
same
compound
merely
mixed
in
different
proportions
what
is
microscopic
in
one
is
largely
developed
in
another
what
is
a
rudimentary
in
one
man
is
an
active
organ
in
another
but
all
things
are
in
all
men
and
one
soul
is
the
model
of
all
we
shall
find
nothing
new
in
human
nature
after
we
have
once
carefully
dissected
and
analyzed
the
one
being
we
ever
shall
truly
know
ourself
the
kaffer
girl
threw
some
coffee
on
my
arm
in
bed
this
morning
i
felt
displeased
but
said
nothing
tant
sannie
would
have
thrown
the
saucer
at
her
and
sworn
for
an
hour
but
the
feeling
would
be
the
same
irritated
displeasure
if
a
huge
animated
stomach
like
bonaparte
were
put
under
a
glass
by
a
skilful
mental
microscopist
even
he
would
be
found
to
have
an
embryonic
doubling
somewhere
indicative
of
a
heart
and
rudimentary
buddings
that
might
have
become
conscience
and
sincerity
let
me
take
your
arm
waldo
how
full
you
are
of
mealie
dust
no
never
mind
it
will
brush
off
and
sometimes
what
is
more
amusing
still
than
tracing
the
likeness
between
man
and
man
is
to
trace
the
analogy
there
always
is
between
the
progress
and
development
of
one
individual
and
of
a
whole
nation
or
again
between
a
single
nation
and
the
entire
human
race
it
is
pleasant
when
it
dawns
on
you
that
the
one
is
just
the
other
written
out
in
large
letters
and
very
odd
to
find
all
the
little
follies
and
virtues
and
developments
and
retrogressions
written
out
in
the
big
world
s
book
that
you
find
in
your
little
internal
self
it
is
the
most
amusing
thing
i
know
of
but
of
course
being
a
woman
i
have
not
often
time
for
such
amusements
professional
duties
always
first
you
know
it
takes
a
great
deal
of
time
and
thought
always
to
look
perfectly
exquisite
even
for
a
pretty
woman
is
the
old
buggy
still
in
existence
waldo
yes
but
the
harness
is
well
i
wish
you
would
mend
it
you
must
teach
me
to
drive
i
must
learn
something
while

this
evening
nice
little
dog
that
of
yours
pretty
little
ears
so
fond
of
pointer
pups
and
they
think
me
fascinating
charming
men
are
like
the
earth
and
we
are
the
moon
we
turn
always
one
side
to
them
and
they
think
there
is
no
other
because
they
don
t
see
it
but
there
they
had
reached
the
house
now
tell
me
when
you
set
to
work
she
said
and
walked
toward
the
door
waldo
stood
to
look
after
her
and
doss
stood
at
his
side
a
look
of
painful
uncertainty
depicted
on
his
small
countenance
and
one
little
foot
poised
in
the
air
should
he
stay
with
his
master
or
go
he
looked
at
the
figure
with
the
wide
straw
hat
moving
toward
the
house
and
he
looked
up
at
his
master
then
he
put
down
the
little
paw
and
went
waldo
watched
them
both
in
at
the
door
and
then
walked
away
alone
he
was
satisfied
that
at
least
his
dog
was
with
her
chapter
tant
sannie
holds
an
upsitting
and
gregory
writes
a
letter
it
was
just
after
sunset
and
lyndall
had
not
yet
returned
from
her
first
when
the
lean
coloured
woman
standing
at
the
corner
of
the
house
to
enjoy
the
evening
breeze
saw
coming
along
the
road
a
strange
horseman
very
narrowly
she
surveyed
him
as
slowly
he
approached
he
was
attired
in
the
deepest
mourning
the
black
crepe
round
his
tall
hat
totally
concealing
the
black
felt
and
nothing
but
a
dazzling
relieving
the
funereal
tone
of
his
attire
he
rode
much
forward
in
his
saddle
with
his
chin
resting
on
the
uppermost
of
his
and
there
was
an
air
of
meek
subjection
to
the
will
of
heaven
and
to
what
might
be
in
store
for
him
that
bespoke
itself
even
in
the
way
in
which
he
gently
urged
his
steed
he
was
evidently
in
no
hurry
to
reach
his
destination
for
the
nearer
he
approached
to
it
the
slacker
did
his
bridle
hang
the
coloured
woman
having
duly
inspected
him
dashed
into
the
dwelling
here
is
another
one
she
cried
a
widower
i
see
it
by
his
good
lord
said
tant
sannie

where

looks

bank
are
to
be
found
she
added
winking
knowingly
how
does
he
look
nineteen
weak
eyes
white
hair
little
round
nose
said
the
maid
then
it
s
he
then
it

triumphantly

whose

not
seen
him
but
my

me
about

and
i
dreamed
about
him
last
here
piet
s
black
hat
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
the
drew
herself
up
in
dignified
silence
extended
the
tips
of
her
fingers
and
motioned
solemnly
to
a
chair
the
young
man
seated
himself
sticking
his
feet
as
far
under
it
as
they
would
go
and
said
mildly
i
am
little
piet
vander
walt
and
my
father

tant
sannie
said
solemnly
aunt
said
the
young
man
starting
up
spasmodically

i
he
seized
his
hat
and
disappeared
with
a
rush
through
the
door
i
told
you
so
i
knew
it
said
tant
sannie
the
dear
lord
doesn
t
send
dreams
for
nothing
didn
t
i
tell

this
morning
that
i
dreamed
of
a
great
beast
like
a
sheep
with
red
eyes
and
i
killed
it
wasn
t
the
white
wool
his
hair
and
the
red
eyes
his
weak
eyes
and
my
killing
him
meant
marriage
get
supper
ready
quickly
the
sheep
s
inside
and
we
shall
sit
up
to
young
piet
vander
walt
that
supper
was
a
period
of
intense
torture
there
was
something
overawing
in
that
assembly
of
english
people
with
their
incomprehensible
speech
and
moreover
it
was
his
first
courtship
his
first
wife
had
courted
him
and
ten
months
of
severe
domestic
rule
had
not
raised
his
spirit
nor
courage
he
ate
little
and
when
he
raised
a
morsel
to
his
lips
glanced
guiltily
round
to
see
if
he
were
not
observed
he
had
put
three
rings
on
his
little
finger
with
the
intention
of
sticking
it
out
stiffly
when
he
raised
a
now
the
little
finger
was
curled
miserably
among
its
fellows
it
was
small
relief
when
the
meal
was
over
and
tant
sannie
and
he
repaired
to
the
front
room
once
seated
there
he
set
his
knees
close
together
stood
his
black
hat
upon
them
and
wretchedly
turned
the
brim
up
and
down
but
supper
had
cheered
tant
sannie
who
found
it
impossible
longer
to
maintain
that
decorous
silence
and
whose
heart
yearned
over
the
youth
i
was
related
to
your
aunt
selena
who
died
said
tant
sannie
my
mother
s
stepbrother
s
child
was
married
to
her
father
s
brother
s
stepnephew
s
yes
aunt
said
the
young
man
i
know
we
were
it
was
her
cousin
said
tant
sannie
now
fairly
on
the
flow
who
had
the
cancer
cut
out
of
her
breast
by
the
other
doctor
who
was
not
the
right
doctor
they
sent
for
but
who
did
it
quite
as
yes
aunt
said
the
young
man
i
ve
heard
about
it
often
said
tant
sannie
and
he
was
the
son
of
the
old
doctor
that
they
say
died
on
but
i
don
t
know
if
that
s
true
people
do
tell
such
awful
lies
why
should
he
die
on
more
than
any
other
day
yes
aunt
why
said
the
young
man
meekly
did
you
ever
have
the
toothache
asked
tant
sannie
no
well
they
say
that
doctor
not
the
son
of
the
old
doctor
that
died
on
the
other
that
didn
t
come
when
he
was
sent
for
he
gave
such
good
stuff
for
the
toothache
that
if
you
opened
the
bottle
in
the
room
where
any
one
was
bad
they
got
better
directly
you
could
see
it
was
good
stuff
said
tant
sannie
it
tasted
horrid
that
was
a
real
doctor
he
used
to
give
a
bottle
so
high
said
the
raising
her
hand
a
foot
from
the
table
you
could
drink
at
it
for
a
month
and
it
wouldn
t
get
done
and
the
same
medicine
was
good
for
all
sorts
of
sicknesses
croup
measles
jaundice
dropsy
now
you
have
to
buy
a
new
kind
for
each
sickness
the
doctors
aren
t
so
good
as
they
used
to
no
aunt
said
the
young
man
who
was
trying
to
gain
courage
to
stick
out
his
legs
and
clink
his
spurs
together
he
did
so
at
last
tant
sannie
had
noticed
the
spurs
before
but
she
thought
it
showed
a
nice
manly
spirit
and
her
heart
warmed
yet
more
to
the
youth
did
you
ever
have
convulsions
when
you
were
a
baby
asked
tant
sannie
yes
said
the
young
man
strange
said
tant
sannie
i
had
convulsions
too
wonderful
that
we
should
be
so
much
alike
aunt
said
the
young
man
explosively
can
we
sit
up
tonight
tant
sannie
hung
her
head
and
half
closed
her
eyes
but
finding
that
her
little
wiles
were
thrown
away
the
young
man
staring
fixedly
at
his
hat
she
simpered
yes
and
went
away
to
fetch
candles
in
the
dining
room
em
worked
at
her
machine
and
gregory
sat
close
beside
her
his
great
blue
eyes
turned
to
the
window
where
lyndall
leaned
out
talking
to
waldo
tant
sannie
took
two
candles
out
of
the
cupboard
and
held
them
up
triumphantly
winking
all
round
the
room
he
s
asked
for
them
she
said
does
he
want
them
for
his
horse
s
rubbed
back
asked
gregory
new
to
life
no
said
tant
sannie
indignantly
we
re
going
to
sit
up
and
she
walked
off
in
triumph
with
the
candles
nevertheless
when
all
the
rest
of
the
house
had
retired
when
the
long
candle
was
lighted
when
the
was
filled
when
she
sat
in
the
with
her
lover
on
a
chair
close
beside
her
and
when
the
vigil
of
the
night
was
fairly
begun
she
began
to
find
it
wearisome
the
young
man
looked
chilly
and
said
nothing
won
t
you
put
your
feet
on
my
stove
said
tant
sannie
no
thank
you
aunt
said
the
young
man
and
both
lapsed
into
silence
at
last
tant
sannie
afraid
of
going
to
sleep
tapped
a
strong
cup
of
coffee
for
herself
and
handed
another
to
her
lover
this
visibly
revived
both
how
long
were
you
married
cousin
ten
months
how
old
was
your
baby
three
days
when
it
it
s
very
hard
when
we
must
give
our
husbands
and
wives
to
the
lord
said
tant
sannie
very
said
the
young
man
but
it
s
the
lord
s
yes
said
tant
sannie
and
sighed
she
was
such
a
good
wife
aunt
i
ve
known
her
break
a
over
a
maid
s
head
for
only
letting
dust
come
on
a
milk
tant
sannie
felt
a
twinge
of
jealousy
she
had
never
broken
a
on
a
maid
s
head
i
hope
your
wife
made
a
good
end
she
said
oh
beautiful
aunt
she
said
up
a
psalm
and
two
hymns
and
a
half
before
she
did
she
leave
any
messages
asked
tant
sannie
no
said
the
young
man
but
the
night
before
she
died
i
was
lying
at
the
foot
of
her
bed
i
felt
her
foot
kick
me
piet
she
said
annie
my
heart
said
i
my
little
baby
that
died
yesterday
has
been
here
and
it
stood
over
the
she
said
what
did
it
say
i
asked
it
said
that
if
i
died
you
must
marry
a
fat
i
will
i
said
and
i
went
to
sleep
again
presently
she
woke
me
the
little
baby
has
been
here
again
and
it
says
you
must
marry
a
woman
over
thirty
and
who
s
had
two
i
didn
t
go
to
sleep
after
that
for
a
long
time
aunt
but
when
i
did
she
woke
me
the
baby
has
been
here
again
she
said
and
it
says
you
mustn
t
marry
a
woman
with
a
i
told
her
i
wouldn
t
and
the
next
day
she
that
was
a
vision
from
the
redeemer
said
tant
sannie
the
young
man
nodded
his
head
mournfully
he
thought
of
a
younger
sister
of
his
wife
s
who
was
not
fat
and
who
had
a
mole
and
of
whom
his
wife
had
always
been
jealous
and
he
wished
the
little
baby
had
liked
better
staying
in
heaven
than
coming
and
standing
over
the
i
suppose
that
s
why
you
came
to
me
said
tant
sannie
yes
aunt
and
pa
said
i
ought
to
get
married
before
it
is
bad
if
there
s
no
one
to
see
after
things
then
and
the
maids
waste
such
a
lot
of
when
do
you
want
to
get
married
next
month
aunt
said
the
young
man
in
a
tone
of
hopeless
resignation
may
i
kiss
you
aunt
fie
fie
said
tant
sannie
and
then
gave
him
a
resounding
kiss
come
draw
your
chair
a
little
closer
she
said
and
their
elbows
now
touching
they
sat
on
through
the
night
the
next
morning
at
dawn
as
em
passed
through
tant
sannie
s
bedroom
she
found
the
pulling
off
her
boots
preparatory
to
climbing
into
bed
where
is
piet
vander
walt
just
gone
said
tant
sannie
and
i
am
going
to
marry
him
this
day
four
weeks
i
am
dead
sleepy
she
added
the
stupid
thing
doesn
t
know
how
to
talk
at
all
and
she
climbed
into
the
clothes
and
all
and
drew
the
quilt
up
to
her
chin
on
the
day
preceding
tant
sannie
s
wedding
gregory
rose
sat
in
the
blazing
sun
on
the
stone
wall
behind
his
house
it
was
warm
but
he
was
intently
watching
a
small
buggy
that
was
being
recklessly
driven
over
the
bushes
in
the
direction
of
the
farmhouse
gregory
never
stirred
till
it
had
vanished
then
finding
the
stones
hot
he
slipped
down
and
walked
into
the
house
he
kicked
the
little
pail
that
lay
in
the
doorway
and
sent
it
into
one
corner
that
did
him
good
then
he
sat
down
on
the
box
and
began
cutting
letters
out
of
a
piece
of
newspaper
finding
that
the
snippings
littered
the
floor
he
picked
them
up
and
began
scribbling
on
his
he
tried
the
effect
of
different
initials
before
the
name
rose
rose
rose
rose
rose
rose
when
he
had
covered
the
sheet
he
looked
at
it
discontentedly
a
little
while
then
suddenly
began
to
write
a
letter
beloved
sister
it
is
a
long
while
since
i
last
wrote
to
you
but
i
have
had
no
time
this
is
the
first
morning
i
have
been
at
home
since
i
don
t
know
when
em
always
expects
me
to
go
down
to
the
farmhouse
in
the
morning
but
i
didn
t
feel
as
though
i
could
stand
the
ride
today
i
have
much
news
for
you
tant
sannie
em
s
boer
stepmother
is
to
be
married
tomorrow
she
is
gone
to
town
today
and
the
wedding
feast
is
to
be
at
her
brother
s
farm
em
and
i
are
going
to
ride
over
on
horseback
but
her
cousin
is
going
to
ride
in
the
buggy
with
that
german
i
don
t
think
i
ve
written
to
you
since
she
came
back
from
school
i
don
t
think
you
would
like
her
at
all
jemima
there
s
something
so
proud
about
her
she
thinks
just
because
she
s
handsome
there
s
nobody
good
enough
to
talk
to
her
and
just
as
if
there
had
nobody
else
but
her
been
to
before
they
are
going
to
have
a
grand
affair
tomorrow
all
the
boers
about
are
coming
and
they
are
going
to
dance
all
night
but
i
don
t
think
i
shall
dance
at
all
for
as
em
s
cousin
says
these
boer
dances
are
low
things
i
am
sure
i
only
danced
at
the
last
to
please
em
i
don
t
know
why
she
is
fond
of
dancing
em
talked
of
our
being
married
on
the
same
day
as
tant
sannie
but
i
said
it
would
be
nicer
for
her
if
she
waited
till
the
shearing
was
over
and
i
took
her
down
to
see
you
i
suppose
she
will
have
to
live
with
us
em
s
cousin
i
mean
as
she
has
not
anything
in
the
world
but
a
poor
fifty
pounds
i
don
t
like
her
at
all
jemima
and
i
don
t
think
you
would
she
s
got
such
queer
ways
she
s
always
driving
about
in
a
gig
with
that
low
german
and
i
don
t
think
it
s
at
all
the
thing
for
a
woman
to
be
going
about
with
a
man
she
s
not
engaged
to
do
you
if
it
was
me
now
of
course
who
am
a
kind
of
connection
it
would
be
different
the
way
she
treats
me
considering
that
i
am
so
soon
to
be
her
cousin
is
not
at
all
nice
i
took
down
my
album
the
other
day
with
your
likenesses
in
it
and
i
told
her
she
could
look
at
it
and
put
it
down
close
to
her
but
she
just
said
thank
you
and
never
even
touched
it
as
much
as
to
say
what
are
your
relations
to
me
she
gets
the
wildest
horses
in
that
buggy
and
a
horrid
snappish
little
cur
belonging
to
the
german
sitting
in
front
and
then
she
drives
out
alone
i
don
t
think
it
s
at
all
proper
for
a
woman
to
drive
out
alone
i
wouldn
t
allow
it
if
she
was
my
sister
the
other
morning
i
don
t
know
how
it
happened
i
was
going
in
the
way
from
which
she
was
coming
and
that
little
beast
they
call
him
doss
began
to
bark
when
he
saw
me
he
always
does
the
little
wretch
and
the
horses
began
to
spring
and
kicked
the
splashboard
all
to
pieces
it
was
a
sight
to
see
jemima
she
has
got
the
littlest
hands
i
ever
saw
i
could
hold
them
both
in
one
of
mine
and
not
know
that
i
d
got
anything
except
that
they
were
so
soft
but
she
held
those
horses
in
as
though
they
were
made
of
iron
when
i
wanted
to
help
her
she
said
no
thank
you
i
can
manage
them
myself
i
ve
got
a
pair
of
bits
that
would
break
their
jaws
if
i
used
them
well
and
she
laughed
and
drove
away
it
s
so
unwomanly
tell
father
my
hire
of
the
ground
will
not
be
out
for
six
months
and
before
that
em
and
i
will
be
married
my
pair
of
birds
is
breeding
now
but
i
haven
t
been
down
to
see
them
for
three
days
i
don
t
seem
to
care
about
anything
any
more
i
don
t
know
what
it
is
i
m
not
well
if
i
go
into
town
on
saturday
i
will
let
the
doctor
examine
me
but
perhaps
she
ll
go
in
herself
it
s
a
very
strange
thing
jemima
but
she
never
will
send
her
letters
to
post
by
me
if
i
ask
her
she
has
none
and
the
very
next
day
she
goes
in
and
posts
them
herself
you
mustn
t
say
anything
about
it
jemima
but
twice
i
ve
brought
her
letters
from
the
post
in
a
gentleman
s
hand
and
i
m
sure
they
were
both
from
the
same
person
because
i
noticed
every
little
mark
even
the
dotting
of
the
i
s
of
course
it
s
nothing
to
me
but
for
em
s
sake
i
can
t
help
feeling
an
interest
in
her
however
much
i
may
dislike
her
myself
and
i
hope
she
s
up
to
nothing
i
pity
the
man
who
marries
her
i
wouldn
t
be
him
for
anything
if
i
had
a
wife
with
pride
i
d
make
her
give
it
up
sharp
i
don
t
believe
in
a
man
who
can
t
make
a
woman
obey
him
now
em
i
m
very
fond
of
her
as
you
know
but
if
i
tell
her
to
put
on
a
certain
dress
that
dress
she
puts
on
and
if
i
tell
her
to
sit
on
a
certain
seat
on
that
seat
she
sits
and
if
i
tell
her
not
to
speak
to
a
certain
individual
she
does
not
speak
to
them
if
a
man
lets
a
woman
do
what
he
doesn
t
like
he
s
a
muff
give
my
love
to
mother
and
the
children
the
veld
here
is
looking
pretty
good
and
the
sheep
are
better
since
we
washed
them
tell
father
the
dip
he
recommended
is
very
good
em
sends
her
love
to
you
she
is
making
me
some
woollen
shirts
but
they
don
t
fit
me
so
nicely
as
those
mother
made
me
write
soon
to
your
loving
brother
gregory
she
drove
past
just
now
i
was
sitting
on
the
kraal
wall
right
before
her
eyes
and
she
never
even
bowed
chapter
a
i
didn
t
know
before
you
were
so
fond
of
riding
hard
said
gregory
to
his
little
betrothed
they
were
cantering
slowly
on
the
road
to
oom
muller
s
on
the
morning
of
the
wedding
do
you
call
this
riding
hard
asked
em
in
some
astonishment
of
course
i
do
it
s
enough
to
break
the
horses
necks
and
knock
one
up
for
the
whole
day
besides
he
added
testily
then
twisted
his
head
to
look
at
the
buggy
that
came
on
behind
i
thought
waldo
was
such
a
mad
driver
they
are
taking
it
easily
enough
today
said
gregory
one
would
think
the
black
stallions
were
i
suppose
they
want
to
keep
out
of
our
dust
said
em
see
they
stand
still
as
soon
as
we
perceiving
this
to
be
the
case
gregory
rode
on
it
s
all
that
horse
of
yours
she
kicks
up
such
a
confounded
dust
i
can
t
stand
it
myself
he
said
meanwhile
the
cart
came
on
slowly
enough
take
the
reins
said
lyndall
and
and
make
them
walk
i
want
to
rest
and
watch
their
hoofs
today
not
to
be
exhilarated
i
am
so
she
leaned
back
in
her
corner
and
waldo
drove
on
slowly
in
the
grey
dawn
light
along
the
level
road
they
passed
the
very
behind
which
so
many
years
before
the
old
german
had
found
the
kaffer
woman
but
their
thoughts
were
not
with
him
that
morning
they
were
the
thoughts
of
the
young
that
run
out
to
meet
the
future
and
labour
in
the
present
at
last
he
touched
her
arm
what
is
it
i
feared
you
had
gone
to
sleep
and
might
be
jolted
out
he
said
you
sat
so
no
do
not
talk
to
me
i
am
not
asleep
but
after
a
time
she
said
suddenly
it
must
be
a
terrible
thing
to
bring
a
human
being
into
the
waldo
looked
round
she
sat
drawn
into
the
corner
her
blue
cloud
wound
tightly
about
her
and
she
still
watched
the
horses
feet
having
no
comment
to
offer
on
her
somewhat
unexpected
remark
he
merely
touched
up
his
horses
i
have
no
conscience
none
she
added
but
i
would
not
like
to
bring
a
soul
into
this
world
when
it
sinned
and
when
it
suffered
something
like
a
dead
hand
would
fall
on
me
you
did
it
you
for
your
own
pleasure
you
created
this
thing
see
your
work
if
it
lived
to
be
eighty
it
would
always
hang
like
a
millstone
round
my
neck
have
the
right
to
demand
good
from
me
and
curse
me
for
its
sorrow
a
parent
is
only
like
to
god
if
his
work
turns
out
bad
so
much
the
worse
for
him
he
dare
not
wash
his
hands
of
it
time
and
years
can
never
bring
the
day
when
you
can
say
to
your
child
soul
what
have
i
to
do
with
you
waldo
said
dreamingly
it
is
a
marvellous
thing
that
one
soul
should
have
power
to
cause
she
heard
the
words
as
she
heard
the
beating
of
the
horses
hoofs
her
thoughts
ran
on
in
their
own
line
they
say
god
sends
the
little
of
all
the
dastardly
revolting
lies
men
tell
to
suit
themselves
i
hate
that
most
i
suppose
my
father
said
so
when
he
knew
he
was
dying
of
consumption
and
my
mother
when
she
knew
she
had
nothing
to
support
me
on
and
they
created
me
to
feed
like
a
dog
from
stranger
hands
men
do
not
say
god
sends
the
books
or
the
newspaper
articles
or
the
machines
they
make
and
then
sigh
and
shrug
their
shoulders
and
say
they
can
t
help
it
why
do
they
say
so
about
other
things
liars
god
sends
the
little
babies
she
struck
her
foot
fretfully
against
the
splashboard
the
small
children
say
so
earnestly
they
touch
the
little
stranger
reverently
who
has
just
come
from
god
s
far
country
and
they
peep
about
the
room
to
see
if
not
one
white
feather
has
dropped
from
the
wing
of
the
angel
that
brought
him
on
their
lips
the
phrase
means
much
on
all
others
it
is
a
deliberate
lie
noticeable
too
she
said
dropping
in
an
instant
from
the
passionate
into
a
low
mocking
tone
when
people
are
married
though
they
should
have
sixty
children
they
throw
the
whole
onus
on
god
when
they
are
not
we
hear
nothing
about
god
s
having
sent
them
when
there
has
been
no
legal
contract
between
the
parents
who
sends
the
little
children
then
the
devil
perhaps
she
laughed
her
little
silvery
mocking
laugh
odd
that
some
men
should
come
from
hell
and
some
from
heaven
and
yet
all
look
so
much
alike
when
they
get
waldo
wondered
at
her
he
had
not
the
key
to
her
thoughts
and
did
not
see
the
string
on
which
they
were
strung
she
drew
her
cloud
tighter
about
her
it
must
be
very
nice
to
believe
in
the
devil
she
said
i
wish
i
did
if
it
would
be
of
any
use
i
would
pray
three
hours
night
and
morning
on
my
bare
knees
god
let
me
believe
in
he
is
so
useful
to
those
people
who
do
they
may
be
as
selfish
and
as
sensual
as
they
please
and
between
god
s
will
and
the
devil
s
action
always
have
some
one
to
throw
their
sin
on
but
we
wretched
unbelievers
we
bear
our
own
burdens
we
must
say
i
myself
did
it
i
not
god
not
satan
i
myself
that
is
the
sting
that
strikes
deep
waldo
she
said
gently
with
a
sudden
and
complete
change
of
manner
i
like
you
so
much
i
love
she
rested
her
cheek
softly
against
his
shoulder
when
i
am
with
you
i
never
know
that
i
am
a
woman
and
you
are
a
man
i
only
know
that
we
are
both
things
that
think
other
men
when
i
am
with
them
whether
i
love
them
or
not
they
are
mere
bodies
to
me
but
you
are
a
spirit
i
like
you
look
she
said
quickly
sinking
back
into
her
corner
what
a
pretty
pinkness
there
is
on
all
the
hilltops
the
sun
will
rise
in
a
waldo
lifted
his
eyes
to
look
round
over
the
circle
of
golden
hills
and
the
horses
as
the
first
sunbeams
touched
them
shook
their
heads
and
champed
their
bright
bits
till
the
brass
settings
in
their
harness
glittered
again
it
was
eight
o
clock
when
they
neared
the
farmhouse
a
building
with
kraals
to
the
right
and
a
small
orchard
to
the
left
already
there
were
signs
of
unusual
life
and
bustle
one
cart
a
wagon
and
a
couple
of
saddles
against
the
wall
betokened
the
arrival
of
a
few
early
guests
whose
numbers
would
soon
be
largely
increased
to
a
dutch
country
wedding
guests
start
up
in
numbers
astonishing
to
one
who
has
merely
ridden
through
the
plains
of
karoo
as
the
morning
advances
riders
on
many
shades
of
steeds
appear
from
all
directions
and
add
their
saddles
to
the
long
rows
against
the
walls
shake
hands
drink
coffee
and
stand
about
outside
in
groups
to
watch
the
arriving
carts
and
as
they
are
unburdened
of
their
heavy
freight
of
massive
tantes
and
comely
daughters
followed
by
swarms
of
children
of
all
sizes
dressed
in
all
manner
of
print
and
moleskin
who
are
taken
care
of
by
hottentot
kaffer
and
nurses
whose
complexions
ranging
from
light
yellow
up
to
ebony
black
add
variety
to
the
animated
scene
everywhere
is
excitement
and
bustle
which
gradually
increases
as
the
time
for
the
return
of
the
approaches
preparations
for
the
feast
are
actively
advancing
in
the
kitchen
coffee
is
liberally
handed
round
and
amid
a
profound
sensation
and
the
firing
of
guns
the
draws
up
and
the
alight
bride
and
bridegroom
with
their
attendants
march
solemnly
to
the
where
bed
and
box
are
decked
out
in
white
with
ends
of
ribbon
and
artificial
flowers
and
where
on
a
row
of
chairs
the
party
solemnly
seat
themselves
after
a
time
bridesmaid
and
best
man
rise
and
conduct
in
with
ceremony
each
individual
guest
to
wish
success
and
to
kiss
bride
and
bridegroom
then
the
feast
is
set
on
the
table
and
it
is
almost
sunset
before
the
dishes
are
cleared
away
and
the
pleasure
of
the
day
begins
everything
is
removed
from
the
great
front
room
and
the
mud
floor
well
rubbed
with
bullock
s
blood
glistens
like
polished
mahogany
the
female
portion
of
the
assembly
flock
into
the
to
attire
themselves
for
the
evening
and
clad
in
white
muslin
and
gay
with
bright
ribbons
and
brass
jewelry
the
dancing
begins
as
the
first
tallow
candles
are
stuck
up
about
the
walls
the
music
coming
from
a
couple
of
fiddlers
in
a
corner
of
the
room
bride
and
bridegroom
open
the
ball
and
the
floor
is
soon
covered
with
whirling
couples
and
every
one
s
spirits
rise
the
bridal
pair
mingle
freely
in
the
throng
and
here
and
there
a
musical
man
sings
vigorously
as
he
drags
his
partner
through
the
blue
water
or
john
speriwig
boys
shout
and
applaud
and
the
enjoyment
and
confusion
are
intense
till
eleven
o
clock
comes
by
this
time
the
children
who
swarm
in
the
are
not
to
be
kept
quiet
longer
even
by
hunches
of
bread
and
cake
there
is
a
general
howl
and
wail
that
rises
yet
higher
than
the
scraping
of
fiddles
and
mothers
rush
from
their
partners
to
knock
small
heads
together
and
cuff
little
nursemaids
and
force
the
wailers
down
into
unoccupied
corners
of
beds
under
tables
and
behind
boxes
in
half
an
hour
every
variety
of
childish
snore
is
heard
on
all
sides
and
it
has
become
perilous
to
raise
or
set
down
a
foot
in
any
of
the
lest
a
small
head
or
hand
should
be
crushed
now
too
the
busy
feet
have
broken
the
solid
coating
of
the
floor
and
a
cloud
of
fine
dust
arises
that
makes
a
yellow
halo
round
the
candles
and
sets
asthmatic
people
coughing
and
grows
denser
till
to
recognise
any
one
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
becomes
impossible
and
a
partner
s
face
is
seen
through
a
yellow
mist
at
twelve
o
clock
the
bride
is
led
to
the
and
undressed
the
lights
are
blown
out
and
the
bridegroom
is
brought
to
the
door
by
the
best
man
who
gives
him
the
key
then
the
door
is
shut
and
locked
and
the
revels
rise
higher
than
ever
there
is
no
thought
of
sleep
till
morning
and
no
unoccupied
spot
where
sleep
may
be
found
it
was
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
on
the
night
of
tant
sannie
s
wedding
that
lyndall
sat
near
the
doorway
in
one
of
the
to
watch
the
dancers
as
they
appeared
and
disappeared
in
the
yellow
cloud
of
dust
gregory
sat
moodily
in
a
corner
of
the
large
his
little
betrothed
touched
his
arm
i
wish
you
would
go
and
ask
lyndall
to
dance
with
you
she
said
she
must
be
so
tired
she
has
sat
still
the
whole
i
have
asked
her
three
times
replied
her
lover
shortly
i
m
not
going
to
be
her
dog
and
creep
to
her
feet
just
to
give
her
the
pleasure
of
kicking
me
not
for
you
em
nor
for
anybody
oh
i
didn
t
know
you
had
asked
her
greg
said
his
little
betrothed
humbly
and
she
went
away
to
pour
out
coffee
nevertheless
some
time
after
gregory
found
he
had
shifted
so
far
round
the
room
as
to
be
close
to
the
door
where
lyndall
sat
after
standing
for
some
time
he
inquired
whether
he
might
not
bring
her
a
cup
of
coffee
she
declined
but
still
he
stood
on
why
should
he
not
stand
there
as
well
as
anywhere
else
and
then
he
stepped
into
the
bedroom
may
i
not
bring
you
a
stove
miss
lyndall
to
put
your
feet
on
thank
he
sought
for
one
and
put
it
under
her
feet
there
is
a
draught
from
that
broken
window
shall
i
stuff
something
in
the
pane
no
we
want
gregory
looked
round
but
nothing
else
suggesting
itself
he
sat
down
on
a
box
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
door
lyndall
sat
before
him
her
chin
resting
in
her
hand
her
eyes
by
day
but
black
by
night
looked
through
the
doorway
into
the
next
room
after
a
time
he
thought
she
had
entirely
forgotten
his
proximity
and
he
dared
to
inspect
the
little
hands
and
neck
as
he
never
dared
when
he
was
in
momentary
dread
of
the
eyes
being
turned
upon
him
she
was
dressed
in
black
which
seemed
to
take
her
yet
further
from
the
gewgawed
women
about
her
and
the
little
hands
were
white
and
the
diamond
ring
glittered
where
had
she
got
that
ring
he
bent
forward
a
little
and
tried
to
decipher
the
letters
but
the
was
too
faint
when
he
looked
up
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
she
was
looking
at
him
not
gregory
felt
as
she
had
ever
looked
at
him
before
not
as
though
he
were
a
stump
or
a
stone
that
chance
had
thrown
in
her
way
tonight
whether
it
were
critically
or
kindly
or
unkindly
he
could
not
tell
but
she
looked
at
him
at
the
man
gregory
rose
with
attention
a
vague
elation
filled
him
he
clinched
his
fist
tight
to
think
of
some
good
idea
he
might
express
to
her
but
of
all
those
profound
things
he
had
pictured
himself
as
saying
to
her
when
he
sat
alone
in
the
house
not
one
came
he
said
at
last
these
boer
dances
are
very
low
things
and
then
as
soon
as
it
had
gone
from
him
he
thought
it
was
not
a
clever
remark
and
wished
it
back
before
lyndall
replied
em
looked
in
at
the
door
oh
come
she
said
they
are
going
to
have
the
i
do
not
want
to
kiss
any
of
these
fellows
take
me
she
slipped
her
hand
into
gregory
s
arm
it
is
so
dusty
em
do
you
care
to
dance
any
more
he
asked
without
rising
oh
i
do
not
mind
the
dust
and
the
dancing
rests
but
he
did
not
move
i
feel
tired
i
do
not
think
i
shall
dance
again
he
said
em
withdrew
her
hand
and
a
young
farmer
came
to
the
door
and
bore
her
off
i
have
often
imagined
remarked
gregory
but
lyndall
had
risen
i
am
tired
she
said
i
wonder
where
waldo
is
he
must
take
me
home
these
people
will
not
leave
off
till
morning
i
suppose
it
is
three
she
made
her
way
past
the
fiddlers
and
a
bench
full
of
tired
dancers
and
passed
out
at
the
front
door
on
the
stoep
a
group
of
men
and
boys
were
smoking
peeping
in
at
the
windows
and
cracking
coarse
jokes
waldo
was
certainly
not
among
them
and
she
made
her
way
to
the
carts
and
wagons
drawn
up
at
some
distance
from
the
homestead
waldo
she
said
peering
into
a
large
cart
is
that
you
i
am
so
dazed
with
the
tallow
candles
i
see
he
had
made
himself
a
place
between
the
two
seats
she
climbed
up
and
sat
on
the
sloping
floor
in
front
i
thought
i
should
find
you
here
she
said
drawing
her
skirt
up
about
her
shoulders
you
must
take
me
home
presently
but
not
she
leaned
her
head
on
the
seat
near
to
his
and
they
listened
in
silence
to
the
fitful
twanging
of
the
fiddles
as
the
bore
it
from
the
farmhouse
and
to
the
ceaseless
thud
of
the
dancers
and
the
peals
of
gross
laughter
she
stretched
out
her
little
hand
to
feel
for
his
it
is
so
nice
to
lie
here
and
hear
that
noise
she
said
i
like
to
feel
that
strange
life
beating
up
against
me
i
like
to
realise
forms
of
life
utterly
unlike
she
drew
a
long
breath
when
my
own
life
feels
small
and
i
am
oppressed
with
it
i
like
to
crush
together
and
see
it
in
a
picture
in
an
instant
a
multitude
of
disconnected
unlike
phases
of
human
life
a
mediaeval
monk
with
his
string
of
beads
pacing
the
quiet
orchard
and
looking
up
from
the
grass
at
his
feet
to
the
heavy
little
malay
boys
playing
naked
on
a
shining
a
hindoo
philosopher
alone
under
his
banyan
tree
thinking
thinking
thinking
so
that
in
the
thought
of
god
he
may
lose
himself
a
troop
of
bacchanalians
dressed
in
white
with
crowns
of
dancing
along
the
roman
streets
a
martyr
on
the
night
of
his
death
looking
through
the
narrow
window
to
the
sky
and
feeling
that
already
he
has
the
wings
that
shall
bear
him
up
she
moved
her
hand
dreamily
over
her
face
an
epicurean
discoursing
at
a
roman
bath
to
a
knot
of
his
disciples
on
the
nature
of
happiness
a
kaffer
witchdoctor
seeking
for
herbs
by
moonlight
while
from
the
huts
on
the
hillside
come
the
sound
of
dogs
barking
and
the
voices
of
women
and
children
a
mother
giving
to
her
children
in
little
wooden
basins
and
singing
the
evening
song
i
like
to
see
it
all
i
feel
it
run
through
me
that
life
belongs
to
me
it
makes
my
little
life
larger
it
breaks
down
the
narrow
walls
that
shut
me
she
sighed
and
drew
a
long
breath
have
you
made
any
plans
she
asked
him
presently
yes
he
said
the
words
coming
in
jets
with
pauses
between
i
will
take
the
grey
mare
i
will
travel
first
i
will
see
the
world
then
i
will
find
what
work
i
do
not
she
made
a
little
impatient
movement
that
is
no
plan
travel
see
the
world
find
work
if
you
go
into
the
world
aimless
without
a
definite
object
dreaming
dreaming
you
will
be
definitely
defeated
bamboozled
knocked
this
way
and
that
in
the
end
you
will
stand
with
your
beautiful
life
all
spent
and
nothing
to
show
they
talk
of
genius
it
is
nothing
but
this
that
a
man
knows
what
he
can
do
best
and
does
it
and
nothing
else
waldo
she
said
knitting
her
little
fingers
closer
among
his
i
wish
i
could
help
you
i
wish
i
could
make
you
see
that
you
must
decide
what
you
will
be
and
do
it
does
not
matter
what
you
choose
be
a
farmer
businessman
artist
what
you
will
but
know
your
aim
and
live
for
that
one
thing
we
have
only
one
life
the
secret
of
success
is
concentration
wherever
there
has
been
a
great
life
or
a
great
work
that
has
gone
before
taste
everything
a
little
look
at
everything
a
little
but
live
for
one
thing
anything
is
possible
to
a
man
who
knows
his
end
and
moves
straight
for
it
and
for
it
alone
i
will
show
you
what
i
mean
she
said
concisely
words
are
gas
till
you
condense
them
into
suppose
a
woman
young
friendless
as
i
am
the
weakest
thing
on
god
s
earth
but
she
must
make
her
way
through
life
what
she
would
be
she
can
not
be
because
she
is
a
woman
so
she
looks
carefully
at
herself
and
the
world
about
her
to
see
where
her
path
must
be
made
there
is
no
one
to
help
her
she
must
help
herself
she
looks
these
things
she
has
a
sweet
voice
rich
in
subtile
intonations
a
fair
very
fair
face
with
a
power
of
concentrating
in
itself
and
giving
expression
to
feelings
that
otherwise
must
have
been
dissipated
in
words
a
rare
power
of
entering
into
other
lives
unlike
her
own
and
intuitively
reading
them
aright
these
qualities
she
has
how
shall
she
use
them
a
poet
a
writer
needs
only
the
mental
what
use
has
he
for
a
beautiful
body
that
registers
clearly
mental
emotions
and
the
painter
wants
an
eye
for
form
and
colour
and
the
musician
an
ear
for
time
and
tune
and
the
mere
drudge
has
no
need
for
mental
gifts
but
there
is
one
art
in
which
all
she
has
would
be
used
for
which
they
are
all
necessary
the
delicate
expressive
body
the
rich
voice
the
power
of
mental
transposition
the
actor
who
absorbs
and
then
reflects
from
himself
other
human
lives
needs
them
all
but
needs
not
much
more
this
is
her
end
but
how
to
reach
it
before
her
are
endless
difficulties
seas
must
be
crossed
poverty
must
be
endured
loneliness
want
she
must
be
content
to
wait
long
before
she
can
even
get
her
feet
upon
the
path
if
she
has
made
blunders
in
the
past
if
she
has
weighted
herself
with
a
burden
which
she
must
bear
to
the
end
she
must
but
bear
the
burden
bravely
and
labour
on
there
is
no
use
in
wailing
and
repentance
here
the
next
world
is
the
place
for
that
this
life
is
too
short
by
our
errors
we
see
deeper
into
life
they
help
she
waited
for
a
while
if
she
does
all
this
if
she
waits
patiently
if
she
is
never
cast
down
never
despairs
never
forgets
her
end
moves
straight
toward
it
bending
men
and
things
most
unlikely
to
her
purpose
she
must
succeed
at
last
men
and
things
are
plastic
they
part
to
the
right
and
left
when
one
comes
among
them
moving
in
a
straight
line
to
one
end
i
know
it
by
my
own
little
experience
she
said
long
years
ago
i
resolved
to
be
sent
to
school
it
seemed
a
thing
utterly
out
of
my
power
but
i
waited
i
watched
i
collected
clothes
i
wrote
took
my
place
at
the
school
when
all
was
ready
i
bore
with
my
full
force
on
the
and
she
sent
me
at
last
it
was
a
small
thing
but
life
is
made
up
of
small
things
as
a
body
is
built
up
of
cells
what
has
been
done
in
small
things
can
be
done
in
large
shall
be
she
said
softly
waldo
listened
to
him
the
words
were
no
confession
no
glimpse
into
the
strong
proud
restless
heart
of
the
woman
they
were
general
words
with
a
general
application
he
looked
up
into
the
sparkling
sky
with
dull
eyes
yes
he
said
but
when
we
lie
and
think
and
think
we
see
that
there
is
nothing
worth
doing
the
universe
is
so
large
and
man
is
so
small
she
shook
her
head
quickly
but
we
must
not
think
so
far
it
is
madness
it
is
a
disease
we
know
that
no
man
s
work
is
great
and
stands
forever
moses
is
dead
and
the
prophets
and
the
books
that
our
grandmothers
fed
on
the
mould
is
eating
your
poet
and
painter
and
actor
before
the
shouts
that
applaud
them
have
died
their
names
grow
strange
they
are
milestones
that
the
world
has
passed
men
have
set
their
mark
on
mankind
forever
as
they
thought
but
time
has
washed
it
out
as
it
has
washed
out
mountains
and
she
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
and
what
if
we
could
help
mankind
and
leave
the
traces
of
our
work
upon
it
to
the
end
mankind
is
only
an
ephemeral
blossom
on
the
tree
of
time
there
were
others
before
it
opened
there
will
be
others
after
it
has
fallen
where
was
man
in
the
time
of
the
dicynodont
and
when
hoary
monsters
wallowed
in
the
mud
will
he
be
found
in
the
aeons
that
are
to
come
we
are
sparks
we
are
shadows
we
are
pollen
which
the
next
wind
will
carry
away
we
are
dying
already
it
is
all
a
dream
i
know
that
thought
when
the
fever
of
living
is
on
us
when
the
desire
to
become
to
know
to
do
is
driving
us
mad
we
can
use
it
as
an
anodyne
to
still
the
fever
and
cool
our
beating
pulses
but
it
is
a
poison
not
a
food
if
we
live
on
it
it
will
turn
our
blood
to
ice
we
might
as
well
be
dead
we
must
not
waldo
i
want
your
life
to
be
beautiful
to
end
in
something
you
are
nobler
and
stronger
than
i
she
said
and
as
much
better
as
one
of
god
s
great
angels
is
better
than
a
sinning
man
your
life
must
go
for
yes
we
will
work
he
said
she
moved
closer
to
him
and
lay
still
his
black
curls
touching
her
smooth
little
head
doss
who
had
lain
at
his
master
s
side
climbed
over
the
bench
and
curled
himself
up
in
her
lap
she
drew
her
skirt
up
over
him
and
the
three
sat
motionless
for
a
long
time
waldo
she
said
suddenly
they
are
laughing
at
who
he
asked
starting
up
they
the
stars
she
said
softly
do
you
not
see
there
is
a
little
white
mocking
finger
pointing
down
at
us
from
each
one
of
them
we
are
talking
of
tomorrow
and
tomorrow
and
our
hearts
are
so
strong
we
are
not
thinking
of
something
that
can
touch
us
softly
in
the
dark
and
make
us
still
forever
they
are
laughing
at
us
both
sat
looking
upward
do
you
ever
pray
he
asked
her
in
a
low
voice
i
never
do
but
i
might
when
i
look
up
there
i
will
tell
you
he
added
in
a
still
lower
voice
where
i
could
pray
if
there
were
a
wall
of
rock
on
the
edge
of
a
world
and
one
rock
stretched
out
far
far
into
space
and
i
stood
alone
upon
it
alone
with
stars
above
me
and
stars
below
me
i
would
not
say
anything
but
the
feeling
would
be
there
was
an
end
to
their
conversation
after
that
and
doss
fell
asleep
on
her
knee
at
last
the
grew
very
chilly
ah
she
said
shivering
and
drawing
the
skirt
about
her
shoulders
i
am
cold
the
horses
and
call
me
when
you
are
she
slipped
down
and
walked
toward
the
house
doss
stiffly
following
her
not
pleased
at
being
roused
at
the
door
she
met
gregory
i
have
been
looking
for
you
everywhere
may
i
not
drive
you
home
he
said
waldo
drives
me
she
replied
passing
on
and
it
appeared
to
gregory
that
she
looked
at
him
in
the
old
way
without
seeing
him
but
before
she
had
reached
the
door
an
idea
had
occurred
to
her
for
she
turned
if
you
wish
to
drive
me
you
gregory
went
to
look
for
em
whom
he
found
pouring
out
coffee
in
the
back
room
he
put
his
hand
quickly
on
her
shoulder
you
must
ride
with
waldo
i
am
going
to
drive
your
cousin
but
i
can
t
come
just
now
greg
i
promised
tant
annie
muller
to
look
after
the
things
while
she
went
to
rest
a
well
you
can
come
presently
can
t
you
i
didn
t
say
you
were
to
come
now
i
m
sick
of
this
thing
said
gregory
turning
sharply
on
his
heel
why
must
i
sit
up
the
whole
night
because
your
stepmother
chooses
to
get
married
oh
it
s
all
right
greg
i
only
meant
but
he
did
not
hear
her
and
a
man
had
come
up
to
have
his
cup
filled
an
hour
after
waldo
came
in
to
look
for
her
and
found
her
still
busy
at
the
table
the
horses
are
ready
he
said
but
if
you
would
like
to
have
one
dance
more
i
will
she
shook
her
head
wearily
no
i
am
quite
ready
i
want
to
and
soon
they
were
on
the
sandy
road
the
buggy
had
travelled
an
hour
before
their
horses
with
heads
close
together
nodding
sleepily
as
they
walked
in
the
starlight
you
might
have
counted
the
rise
and
fall
of
their
feet
in
the
sand
and
waldo
in
his
saddle
nodded
drowsily
also
only
em
was
awake
and
watched
the
starlit
road
with
eyes
at
last
she
spoke
i
wonder
if
all
people
feel
so
old
so
very
old
when
they
get
to
be
seventeen
not
older
than
before
said
waldo
sleepily
pulling
at
his
bridle
presently
she
said
again
i
wish
i
could
have
been
a
little
child
always
you
are
good
then
you
are
never
selfish
you
like
every
one
to
have
everything
but
when
you
are
grown
up
there
are
some
things
you
like
to
have
all
to
yourself
you
don
t
like
any
one
else
to
have
any
of
yes
said
waldo
sleepily
and
she
did
not
speak
again
when
they
reached
the
farmhouse
all
was
dark
for
lyndall
had
retired
as
soon
as
they
got
home
waldo
lifted
em
from
her
saddle
and
for
a
moment
she
leaned
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
clung
to
him
you
are
very
tired
he
said
as
he
walked
with
her
to
the
door
let
me
go
in
and
light
a
candle
for
no
thank
you
it
is
all
right
she
said
good
night
waldo
but
when
she
went
in
she
sat
long
alone
in
the
dark
chapter
waldo
goes
out
to
taste
life
and
em
stays
at
home
and
tastes
it
at
nine
o
clock
in
the
evening
packing
his
bundles
for
the
next
morning
s
start
waldo
looked
up
and
was
surprised
to
see
em
s
yellow
head
peeping
in
at
his
door
it
was
many
a
month
since
she
had
been
there
she
said
she
had
made
him
sandwiches
for
his
journey
and
she
stayed
a
while
to
help
him
put
his
goods
into
the
saddlebags
you
can
leave
the
old
things
lying
about
she
said
i
will
lock
the
room
and
keep
it
waiting
for
you
to
come
back
some
to
come
back
some
day
would
the
bird
ever
return
to
its
cage
but
he
thanked
her
when
she
went
away
he
stood
on
the
doorstep
holding
the
candle
till
she
had
almost
reached
the
house
but
em
was
that
evening
in
no
hurry
to
enter
and
instead
of
going
in
at
the
back
door
walked
with
lagging
footsteps
round
the
low
brick
wall
that
ran
before
the
house
opposite
the
open
window
of
the
parlour
she
stopped
the
little
room
kept
carefully
closed
in
tant
sannie
s
time
was
well
lighted
by
a
paraffin
lamp
books
and
work
lay
strewn
about
it
and
it
wore
a
bright
habitable
aspect
beside
the
lamp
at
the
table
in
the
corner
sat
lyndall
the
open
letters
and
papers
of
the
day
s
post
lying
scattered
before
her
while
she
perused
the
columns
of
a
newspaper
at
the
centre
table
with
his
arms
folded
on
an
open
paper
which
there
was
not
light
enough
to
read
sat
gregory
he
was
looking
at
her
the
light
from
the
open
window
fell
on
em
s
little
face
under
its
white
kapje
as
she
looked
in
but
no
one
glanced
that
way
go
and
fetch
me
a
glass
of
water
lyndall
said
at
last
gregory
went
out
to
find
it
when
he
put
it
down
at
her
side
she
merely
moved
her
head
in
recognition
and
he
went
back
to
his
seat
and
his
old
occupation
then
em
moved
slowly
away
from
the
window
and
through
it
came
in
spotted
insects
to
play
round
the
lamp
till
one
by
one
they
stuck
to
its
glass
and
fell
to
the
foot
dead
ten
o
clock
struck
then
lyndall
rose
gathered
up
her
papers
and
letters
and
wished
gregory
good
night
some
time
after
em
entered
she
had
been
sitting
all
the
while
on
the
loft
ladder
and
had
drawn
her
kapje
down
very
much
over
her
face
gregory
was
piecing
together
the
bits
of
an
envelope
when
she
came
in
i
thought
you
were
never
coming
he
said
turning
round
quickly
and
throwing
the
fragments
onto
the
floor
you
know
i
have
been
shearing
all
day
and
it
is
ten
o
clock
i
m
sorry
i
did
not
think
you
would
be
going
so
soon
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
can
t
hear
what
you
say
what
makes
you
mumble
so
well
good
night
he
stooped
down
hastily
to
kiss
her
i
want
to
talk
to
you
well
make
haste
he
said
pettishly
i
m
awfully
tired
i
ve
been
sitting
here
all
the
evening
why
couldn
t
you
come
and
talk
before
i
will
not
keep
you
long
she
answered
very
steadily
now
i
think
gregory
it
would
be
better
if
you
and
i
were
never
to
be
good
heaven
em
what
do
you
mean
i
thought
you
were
so
fond
of
me
you
always
professed
to
be
what
on
earth
have
you
taken
into
your
head
now
i
think
it
would
be
better
she
said
folding
her
hands
over
each
other
very
much
as
though
she
were
praying
better
em
what
do
you
mean
even
a
woman
can
t
take
a
freak
all
about
nothing
you
must
have
some
reason
for
it
and
i
m
sure
i
ve
done
nothing
to
offend
you
i
wrote
only
today
to
my
sister
to
tell
her
to
come
up
next
month
to
our
wedding
and
i
ve
been
as
affectionate
and
happy
as
possible
come
what
s
the
matter
he
put
his
arm
half
round
her
shoulder
very
loosely
i
think
it
would
be
better
she
answered
slowly
oh
well
he
said
drawing
himself
up
if
you
won
t
enter
into
explanations
you
won
t
and
i
m
not
the
man
to
beg
and
pray
not
to
any
woman
and
you
know
that
if
you
don
t
want
to
marry
me
i
can
t
oblige
you
to
of
she
stood
quite
still
before
him
you
women
never
do
know
your
own
minds
for
two
days
together
and
of
course
you
know
the
state
of
your
own
feelings
best
but
it
s
very
strange
have
you
really
made
up
your
mind
em
well
i
m
very
sorry
i
m
sure
i
ve
not
been
in
anything
to
blame
a
man
can
t
always
be
billing
and
cooing
but
as
you
say
if
your
feeling
for
me
has
changed
it
s
much
better
you
shouldn
t
marry
me
there
s
nothing
so
foolish
as
to
marry
some
one
you
don
t
love
and
i
only
wish
for
your
happiness
i
m
sure
i
daresay
you
ll
find
some
one
can
make
you
much
happier
than
i
could
the
first
person
we
love
is
seldom
the
right
one
you
are
very
young
it
s
quite
natural
you
should
she
said
nothing
things
often
seem
hard
at
the
time
but
providence
makes
them
turn
out
for
the
best
in
the
end
said
gregory
you
ll
let
me
kiss
you
em
just
for
old
friendship
s
he
stooped
down
you
must
look
upon
me
as
a
dear
brother
as
a
cousin
at
least
as
long
as
i
am
on
the
farm
i
shall
always
be
glad
to
help
you
soon
after
the
brown
pony
was
cantering
along
the
footpath
to
the
house
and
his
master
as
he
rode
whistled
john
speriwig
and
the
thorn
kloof
schottische
the
sun
had
not
yet
touched
the
outstretched
arms
of
the
prickly
pear
upon
the
kopje
and
the
early
cocks
and
hens
still
strutted
about
stiffly
after
the
night
s
roost
when
waldo
stood
before
the
saddling
the
grey
mare
every
now
and
then
he
glanced
up
at
the
old
familiar
objects
they
had
a
new
aspect
that
morning
even
the
cocks
seen
in
the
light
of
parting
had
a
peculiar
interest
and
he
listened
with
conscious
attention
while
one
crowed
clear
and
loud
as
it
stood
on
the
pigsty
wall
he
wished
good
morning
softly
to
the
kaffer
woman
who
was
coming
up
from
the
huts
to
light
the
fire
he
was
leaving
them
all
to
that
old
life
and
from
his
height
he
looked
down
on
them
pityingly
so
they
would
keep
on
crowing
and
coming
to
light
fires
when
for
him
that
old
colourless
existence
was
but
a
dream
he
went
into
the
house
to
say
to
em
and
then
he
walked
to
the
door
of
lyndall
s
room
to
wake
her
but
she
was
up
and
standing
in
the
doorway
so
you
are
ready
she
said
waldo
looked
at
her
with
sudden
heaviness
the
exhilaration
died
out
of
his
heart
her
grey
hung
close
about
her
and
below
its
edge
the
little
bare
feet
were
resting
on
the
threshold
i
wonder
when
we
shall
meet
again
waldo
what
you
will
be
and
what
i
will
you
write
to
me
he
asked
of
her
yes
and
if
i
should
not
you
can
still
remember
wherever
you
are
that
you
are
not
i
have
left
doss
for
you
he
said
will
you
not
miss
him
no
i
want
you
to
have
him
he
loves
you
better
than
he
loves
thank
they
stood
quiet
she
said
putting
her
little
hand
in
his
and
he
turned
away
but
when
he
reached
the
door
she
called
to
him
come
back
i
want
to
kiss
she
drew
his
face
down
to
hers
and
held
it
with
both
hands
and
kissed
it
on
the
forehead
and
mouth
dear
when
he
looked
back
the
little
figure
with
its
beautiful
eyes
was
standing
in
the
doorway
still
chapter
the
kopje
good
morning
em
who
was
in
the
storeroom
measuring
the
kaffer
s
rations
looked
up
and
saw
her
former
lover
standing
betwixt
her
and
the
sunshine
for
some
days
after
that
evening
on
which
he
had
ridden
home
whistling
he
had
shunned
her
she
might
wish
to
enter
into
explanations
and
he
gregory
rose
was
not
the
man
for
that
kind
of
thing
if
a
woman
had
once
thrown
him
overboard
she
must
take
the
consequences
and
stand
by
them
when
however
she
showed
no
inclination
to
revert
to
the
past
and
shunned
him
more
than
he
shunned
her
gregory
softened
you
must
let
me
call
you
em
still
and
be
like
a
brother
to
you
till
i
go
he
said
and
em
thanked
him
so
humbly
that
he
wished
she
hadn
t
it
wasn
t
so
easy
after
that
to
think
himself
an
injured
man
on
that
morning
he
stood
some
time
in
the
doorway
switching
his
whip
and
moving
rather
restlessly
from
one
leg
to
the
other
i
think
i
ll
just
take
a
walk
up
to
the
camps
and
see
how
your
birds
are
getting
on
now
waldo
s
gone
you
ve
no
one
to
see
after
things
nice
morning
isn
t
it
then
he
added
suddenly
i
ll
just
go
round
to
the
house
and
get
a
drink
of
water
first
and
somewhat
awkwardly
walked
off
he
might
have
found
water
in
the
kitchen
but
he
never
glanced
toward
the
buckets
in
the
front
room
a
monkey
and
two
tumblers
stood
on
the
but
he
merely
looked
round
peeped
into
the
parlour
looked
round
again
and
then
walked
out
at
the
front
door
and
found
himself
again
at
the
storeroom
without
having
satisfied
his
thirst
awfully
nice
morning
this
he
said
trying
to
pose
himself
in
a
graceful
and
indifferent
attitude
against
the
door
it
isn
t
hot
and
it
isn
t
cold
it
s
awfully
yes
said
em
your
cousin
now
said
gregory
in
an
aimless
sort
of
way
i
suppose
she
s
shut
up
in
her
room
writing
no
said
em
gone
for
a
drive
i
expect
nice
morning
for
a
gone
to
see
the
ostriches
i
suppose
after
a
little
silence
em
added
i
saw
her
go
by
the
kraals
to
the
gregory
crossed
and
uncrossed
his
legs
well
i
think
i
ll
just
go
and
have
a
look
about
he
said
and
see
how
things
are
getting
on
before
i
go
to
the
camps
so
em
left
for
a
while
the
bags
she
was
folding
and
went
to
the
window
the
same
through
which
years
before
bonaparte
had
watched
the
slouching
figure
cross
the
yard
gregory
walked
to
the
pigsty
first
and
contemplated
the
pigs
for
a
few
seconds
then
turned
round
and
stood
looking
fixedly
at
the
wall
of
the
as
though
he
thought
it
wanted
repairing
then
he
started
off
suddenly
with
the
evident
intention
of
going
to
the
then
paused
hesitated
and
finally
walked
off
in
the
direction
of
the
kopje
then
em
went
back
to
the
corner
and
folded
more
sacks
on
the
other
side
of
the
kopje
gregory
caught
sight
of
a
white
tail
waving
among
the
stones
and
a
succession
of
short
frantic
barks
told
where
doss
was
engaged
in
howling
imploringly
to
a
lizard
who
had
crept
between
two
stones
and
who
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
himself
at
that
particular
moment
the
dog
s
mistress
sat
higher
up
under
the
shelving
rock
her
face
bent
over
a
volume
of
plays
upon
her
knee
as
gregory
mounted
the
stones
she
started
violently
and
looked
up
then
resumed
her
book
i
hope
i
am
not
troubling
you
said
gregory
as
he
reached
her
side
if
i
am
i
will
go
away
i
just
no
you
may
i
fear
i
startled
yes
your
step
was
firmer
than
it
generally
is
i
thought
it
was
that
of
some
one
who
could
it
be
but
me
asked
gregory
seating
himself
on
a
stone
at
her
feet
do
you
suppose
you
are
the
only
man
who
would
find
anything
to
attract
him
to
this
kopje
oh
no
said
gregory
he
was
not
going
to
argue
that
point
with
her
nor
any
other
but
no
old
boer
was
likely
to
take
the
trouble
of
climbing
the
kopje
and
who
else
was
there
she
continued
the
study
of
her
book
miss
lyndall
he
said
at
last
i
don
t
know
why
it
is
you
never
talk
to
we
had
a
long
conversation
yesterday
she
said
without
looking
up
yes
but
you
ask
me
questions
about
sheep
and
oxen
i
don
t
call
that
talking
you
used
to
talk
to
waldo
now
he
said
in
an
aggrieved
tone
of
voice
i
ve
heard
you
when
i
came
in
and
then
you
ve
just
left
off
you
treated
me
like
that
from
the
first
day
and
you
couldn
t
tell
from
just
looking
at
me
that
i
couldn
t
talk
about
the
things
you
like
i
m
sure
i
know
as
much
about
such
things
as
waldo
does
said
gregory
in
exceeding
bitterness
of
spirit
i
do
not
know
which
things
you
refer
to
if
you
will
enlighten
me
i
am
quite
prepared
to
speak
of
them
she
said
reading
as
she
spoke
oh
you
never
used
to
ask
waldo
like
that
said
gregory
in
a
more
sorely
aggrieved
tone
than
ever
you
used
just
to
well
let
me
see
she
said
closing
her
book
and
folding
her
hands
on
it
there
at
the
foot
of
the
kopje
goes
a
kaffer
he
has
nothing
on
but
a
blanket
he
is
a
splendid
fellow
six
feet
high
with
a
magnificent
pair
of
legs
in
his
leather
bag
he
is
going
to
fetch
his
rations
and
i
suppose
to
kick
his
wife
with
his
beautiful
legs
when
he
gets
home
he
has
a
right
to
he
bought
her
for
two
oxen
there
is
a
lean
dog
going
after
him
to
whom
i
suppose
he
never
gives
more
than
a
bone
from
which
he
has
sucked
the
marrow
but
his
dog
loves
him
as
his
wife
does
there
is
something
of
the
master
about
him
in
spite
of
his
blackness
and
wool
see
how
he
brandishes
his
stick
and
holds
up
his
head
oh
but
aren
t
you
making
fun
said
gregory
looking
doubtfully
from
her
to
the
kaffer
herd
who
rounded
the
kopje
no
i
am
very
serious
he
is
the
most
interesting
and
intelligent
thing
i
can
see
just
now
except
perhaps
doss
he
is
profoundly
suggestive
will
his
race
melt
away
in
the
heat
of
a
collision
with
a
higher
are
the
men
of
the
future
to
see
his
bones
only
in
museums
a
vestige
of
one
link
that
spanned
between
the
dog
and
the
white
man
he
wakes
thoughts
that
run
far
out
into
the
future
and
back
into
the
gregory
was
not
quite
sure
how
to
take
these
remarks
being
about
a
kaffer
they
appeared
to
be
of
the
nature
of
a
joke
but
being
seriously
spoken
they
appeared
earnest
so
he
half
laughed
and
half
not
to
be
on
the
safe
side
i
ve
often
thought
so
myself
it
s
funny
we
should
both
think
the
same
i
knew
we
should
if
once
we
talked
but
there
are
other
things
love
now
he
added
i
wonder
if
we
would
think
alike
about
that
i
wrote
an
essay
on
love
once
the
master
said
it
was
the
best
i
ever
wrote
and
i
can
remember
the
first
sentence
still
love
is
something
that
you
feel
in
your
that
was
a
trenchant
remark
can
t
you
remember
any
more
no
said
gregory
regretfully
i
ve
forgotten
the
rest
but
tell
me
what
do
you
think
about
love
a
look
half
of
abstraction
half
amusement
played
on
her
lips
i
don
t
know
much
about
love
she
said
and
i
do
not
like
to
talk
of
things
i
do
not
understand
but
i
have
heard
two
opinions
some
say
the
devil
carried
the
seed
from
hell
and
planted
it
on
the
earth
to
plague
men
and
make
them
sin
and
some
say
that
when
all
the
plants
in
the
garden
of
eden
were
pulled
up
by
the
roots
one
bush
that
the
angels
planted
was
left
growing
and
it
spread
its
seed
over
the
whole
earth
and
its
name
is
love
i
do
not
know
which
is
right
perhaps
both
there
are
different
species
that
go
under
the
same
name
there
is
a
love
that
begins
in
the
head
and
goes
down
to
the
heart
and
grows
slowly
but
it
lasts
till
death
and
asks
less
than
it
gives
there
is
another
love
that
blots
out
wisdom
that
is
sweet
with
the
sweetness
of
life
and
bitter
with
the
bitterness
of
death
lasting
for
an
hour
but
it
is
worth
having
lived
a
whole
life
for
that
hour
i
can
not
tell
perhaps
the
old
monks
were
right
when
they
tried
to
root
love
out
perhaps
the
poets
are
right
when
they
try
to
water
it
it
is
a
flower
with
the
colour
of
sin
but
there
is
always
the
scent
of
a
god
about
gregory
would
have
made
a
remark
but
she
said
without
noticing
there
are
as
many
kinds
of
loves
as
there
are
flowers
everlastings
that
never
wither
speedwells
that
wait
for
the
wind
to
fan
them
out
of
life
that
pour
their
voluptuous
sweetness
out
for
one
day
and
lie
in
the
dust
at
night
there
is
no
flower
has
the
charm
of
all
the
speedwell
s
purity
the
everlasting
s
strength
the
s
warmth
but
who
knows
whether
there
is
no
love
that
holds
all
friendship
passion
worship
such
a
love
she
said
in
her
sweetest
voice
will
fall
on
the
surface
of
strong
cold
selfish
life
as
the
sunlight
falls
on
a
torpid
winter
world
there
where
the
trees
are
bare
and
the
ground
frozen
till
it
rings
to
the
step
like
iron
and
the
water
is
solid
and
the
air
is
sharp
as
a
knife
that
cuts
the
unwary
but
when
its
sun
shines
on
it
through
its
whole
dead
crust
a
throbbing
yearning
wakes
the
trees
feel
him
and
every
knot
and
bud
swell
aching
to
open
to
him
the
brown
seeds
who
have
slept
deep
under
the
ground
feel
him
and
he
gives
them
strength
till
they
break
through
the
frozen
earth
and
lift
two
tiny
trembling
green
hands
in
love
to
him
and
he
touches
the
water
till
down
to
its
depths
it
feels
him
and
melts
and
it
flows
and
the
things
strange
sweet
things
that
were
locked
up
in
it
it
sings
as
it
runs
for
love
of
him
each
plant
tries
to
bear
at
least
one
fragrant
little
flower
for
him
and
the
world
that
was
dead
lives
and
the
heart
that
was
dead
and
throbs
with
an
upward
outward
yearning
and
it
has
become
that
which
it
seemed
impossible
ever
to
become
there
does
that
satisfy
you
she
asked
looking
down
at
gregory
is
that
how
you
like
me
to
talk
oh
yes
said
gregory
that
is
what
i
have
already
thought
we
have
the
same
thoughts
about
everything
how
strange
very
said
lyndall
working
with
her
little
toe
at
a
stone
in
the
ground
before
her
gregory
felt
he
must
sustain
the
conversation
the
only
thing
he
could
think
of
was
to
recite
a
piece
of
poetry
he
knew
he
had
learnt
many
about
love
but
the
only
thing
that
would
come
into
his
mind
now
was
the
battle
of
hohenlinden
and
not
a
drum
was
heard
neither
of
which
seemed
to
bear
directly
on
the
subject
on
hand
but
unexpected
relief
came
to
him
from
doss
who
too
deeply
lost
in
contemplation
of
his
crevice
was
surprised
by
the
sudden
descent
of
the
stone
lyndall
s
foot
had
loosened
which
rolling
against
his
little
front
paw
carried
away
a
piece
of
doss
stood
on
three
legs
holding
up
the
paw
with
an
expression
of
extreme
he
then
proceeded
to
hop
slowly
upward
in
search
of
sympathy
you
have
hurt
that
dog
said
gregory
have
i
she
replied
indifferently
and
the
book
as
though
to
resume
her
study
of
the
play
he
s
a
nasty
snappish
little
cur
said
gregory
calculating
from
her
manner
that
the
remark
would
be
endorsed
he
snapped
at
my
horse
s
tail
yesterday
and
nearly
made
it
throw
me
i
wonder
his
master
didn
t
take
him
instead
of
leaving
him
here
to
be
a
nuisance
to
all
of
us
lyndall
seemed
absorbed
in
her
play
but
he
ventured
another
remark
do
you
think
now
miss
lyndall
that
he
ll
ever
have
anything
in
the
world
that
german
i
mean
money
enough
to
support
a
wife
on
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
don
t
he
s
what
i
call
she
was
spreading
her
skirt
out
softly
with
her
left
hand
for
the
dog
to
lie
down
on
it
i
think
i
should
be
rather
astonished
if
he
ever
became
a
respectable
member
of
society
she
said
i
don
t
expect
to
see
him
the
possessor
of
the
chairman
of
a
divisional
council
and
the
father
of
a
large
family
wearing
a
black
hat
and
going
to
church
twice
on
a
sunday
he
would
rather
astonish
me
if
he
came
to
such
an
yes
i
don
t
expect
anything
of
him
either
said
gregory
zealously
well
i
don
t
know
said
lyndall
there
are
some
small
things
i
rather
look
to
him
for
if
he
were
to
invent
wings
or
carve
a
statue
that
one
might
look
at
for
half
an
hour
without
wanting
to
look
at
something
else
i
should
not
be
surprised
he
may
do
some
little
thing
of
that
kind
perhaps
when
he
has
done
fermenting
and
the
sediment
has
all
gone
to
the
gregory
felt
that
what
she
said
was
not
wholly
intended
as
blame
well
i
don
t
know
he
said
sulkily
to
me
he
looks
like
a
fool
to
walk
about
always
in
that
sort
of
way
muttering
to
himself
like
an
old
kaffer
witchdoctor
he
works
hard
enough
but
it
s
always
as
though
he
didn
t
know
what
he
was
doing
you
don
t
know
how
he
looks
to
a
person
who
sees
him
for
the
first
lyndall
was
softly
touching
the
little
sore
foot
as
she
read
and
doss
to
show
he
liked
it
licked
her
hand
but
miss
lyndall
persisted
gregory
what
do
you
really
think
of
him
i
think
said
lyndall
that
he
is
like
a
which
grows
up
very
quietly
without
any
one
s
caring
for
it
and
one
day
suddenly
breaks
out
into
yellow
and
what
do
you
think
i
am
like
asked
gregory
hopefully
lyndall
looked
up
from
her
book
like
a
little
tin
duck
floating
on
a
dish
of
water
that
comes
after
a
piece
of
bread
stuck
on
a
needle
and
the
more
the
needle
pricks
it
the
more
it
comes
oh
you
are
making
fun
of
me
now
you
really
are
said
gregory
feeling
wretched
you
are
making
fun
aren
t
you
now
partly
it
is
always
diverting
to
make
yes
but
you
don
t
compare
me
to
anything
nice
and
you
do
other
people
what
is
em
like
now
the
accompaniment
of
a
song
she
fills
up
the
gaps
in
other
people
s
lives
and
is
always
number
two
but
i
think
she
is
like
many
accompaniments
a
great
deal
better
than
the
song
she
is
to
she
is
not
half
so
good
as
you
are
said
gregory
with
a
burst
of
uncontrollable
ardour
she
is
so
much
better
than
i
that
her
little
finger
has
more
goodness
in
it
than
my
whole
body
i
hope
you
may
not
live
to
find
out
the
truth
of
that
you
are
like
an
angel
he
said
the
blood
rushing
to
his
head
and
face
yes
probably
angels
are
of
many
you
are
the
one
being
that
i
love
said
gregory
quivering
i
thought
i
loved
before
but
i
know
now
do
not
be
angry
with
me
i
know
you
could
never
like
me
but
if
i
might
but
always
be
near
you
to
serve
you
i
would
be
utterly
utterly
happy
i
would
ask
nothing
in
return
if
you
could
only
take
everything
i
have
and
use
it
i
want
nothing
but
to
be
of
use
to
she
looked
at
him
for
a
few
moments
how
do
you
know
she
said
slowly
that
you
could
not
do
something
to
serve
me
you
could
serve
me
by
giving
me
your
he
started
and
turned
his
burning
face
to
her
you
are
very
cruel
you
are
ridiculing
me
he
said
no
i
am
not
gregory
what
i
am
saying
is
plain
business
if
you
are
willing
to
give
me
your
name
within
three
weeks
time
i
am
willing
to
marry
you
if
not
well
i
want
nothing
more
than
your
name
that
is
a
clear
proposal
is
it
not
he
looked
up
was
it
contempt
loathing
pity
that
moved
in
the
eyes
above
he
could
not
tell
but
he
stooped
over
the
little
foot
and
kissed
it
she
smiled
do
you
really
mean
it
he
whispered
yes
you
wish
to
serve
me
and
to
have
nothing
in
return
you
shall
have
what
you
she
held
out
her
fingers
for
doss
to
lick
do
you
see
this
dog
he
licks
my
hand
because
i
love
him
and
i
allow
him
to
where
i
do
not
love
i
do
not
allow
it
i
believe
you
love
me
i
too
could
love
so
that
to
lie
under
the
foot
of
the
thing
i
loved
would
be
more
heaven
than
to
lie
in
the
breast
of
another
come
let
us
go
carry
the
dog
she
added
he
will
not
bite
you
if
i
put
him
in
your
arms
so
do
not
let
his
foot
hang
they
descended
the
kopje
at
the
bottom
he
whispered
would
you
not
take
my
arm
the
path
is
very
she
rested
her
fingers
lightly
on
it
i
may
yet
change
my
mind
about
marrying
you
before
the
time
comes
it
is
very
likely
mark
you
she
said
turning
round
on
him
i
remember
your
words
you
will
give
everything
and
expect
nothing
the
knowledge
that
you
are
serving
me
is
to
be
your
reward
and
you
will
have
that
you
will
serve
me
and
greatly
the
reasons
i
have
for
marrying
you
i
need
not
inform
you
of
now
you
will
probably
discover
some
of
them
before
i
only
want
to
be
of
some
use
to
you
he
said
it
seemed
to
gregory
that
there
were
pulses
in
the
soles
of
his
feet
and
the
ground
shimmered
as
on
a
summer
s
day
they
walked
round
the
foot
of
the
kopje
and
past
the
kaffer
huts
an
old
kaffer
maid
knelt
at
the
door
of
one
grinding
mealies
that
she
should
see
him
walking
so
made
his
heart
beat
so
fast
that
the
hand
on
his
arm
felt
its
pulsation
it
seemed
that
she
must
envy
him
just
then
em
looked
out
again
at
the
back
window
and
saw
them
coming
she
cried
bitterly
all
the
while
she
sorted
the
skins
but
that
night
when
lyndall
had
blown
her
candle
out
and
half
turned
round
to
sleep
the
door
of
em
s
bedroom
opened
i
want
to
say
good
night
to
you
lyndall
she
said
coming
to
the
bedside
and
kneeling
down
i
thought
you
were
asleep
lyndall
replied
yes
i
have
been
asleep
but
i
had
such
a
vivid
dream
she
said
holding
the
other
s
hands
and
that
woke
me
i
never
had
so
vivid
a
dream
before
it
seemed
i
was
a
little
girl
again
and
i
came
somewhere
into
a
large
room
on
a
bed
in
the
corner
there
was
something
lying
dressed
in
white
and
its
little
eyes
were
shut
and
its
little
face
was
like
wax
i
thought
it
was
a
doll
and
i
ran
forward
to
take
it
but
some
one
held
up
her
finger
and
said
hush
it
is
a
little
dead
and
i
said
oh
i
must
go
and
call
lyndall
that
she
may
look
at
it
and
they
put
their
faces
close
down
to
my
ear
and
whispered
it
is
lyndall
s
and
i
said
she
can
not
be
grown
up
yet
she
is
only
a
little
girl
where
is
she
and
i
went
to
look
for
you
but
i
could
not
find
you
and
when
i
came
to
some
people
who
were
dressed
in
black
i
asked
them
where
you
were
and
they
looked
down
at
their
black
clothes
and
shook
their
heads
and
said
nothing
and
i
could
not
find
you
anywhere
and
then
i
awoke
lyndall
she
said
putting
her
face
down
upon
the
hands
she
held
it
made
me
think
about
that
time
when
we
were
little
girls
and
used
to
play
together
when
i
loved
you
better
than
anything
else
in
the
world
it
isn
t
any
one
s
fault
that
they
love
you
they
can
t
help
it
and
it
isn
t
your
fault
you
don
t
make
them
love
you
i
know
thank
you
dear
lyndall
said
it
is
nice
to
be
loved
but
it
would
be
better
to
be
then
they
wished
good
night
and
em
went
back
to
her
room
long
after
lyndall
lay
in
the
dark
thinking
thinking
thinking
and
as
she
turned
round
wearily
to
sleep
she
muttered
there
are
some
wiser
in
their
sleeping
than
in
their
chapter
lyndall
s
stranger
a
fire
is
burning
in
the
unused
hearth
of
the
cabin
the
fuel
blazes
up
and
lights
the
black
rafters
and
warms
the
faded
red
lions
on
the
quilt
and
fills
the
little
room
with
a
glow
of
warmth
and
light
made
brighter
by
contrast
for
outside
the
night
is
chill
and
misty
before
the
open
fireplace
sits
a
stranger
his
tall
slight
figure
reposing
in
the
broken
armchair
his
keen
blue
eyes
studying
the
fire
from
beneath
delicately
pencilled
drooping
eyelids
one
white
hand
plays
thoughtfully
with
a
heavy
flaxen
moustache
yet
once
he
starts
and
for
an
instant
the
languid
lids
raise
themselves
there
is
a
keen
intent
look
upon
the
face
as
he
listens
for
something
then
he
leans
back
in
his
chair
fills
his
glass
from
the
silver
flask
in
his
bag
and
resumes
his
old
posture
presently
the
door
opens
noiselessly
it
is
lyndall
followed
by
doss
quietly
as
she
enters
he
hears
her
and
turns
i
thought
you
were
not
i
waited
till
all
had
gone
to
bed
i
could
not
come
she
removed
the
shawl
that
enveloped
her
and
the
stranger
rose
to
offer
her
his
chair
but
she
took
her
seat
on
a
low
pile
of
sacks
before
the
window
i
hardly
see
why
i
should
be
outlawed
after
this
fashion
he
said
reseating
himself
and
drawing
his
chair
a
little
nearer
to
her
these
are
hardly
the
quarters
one
expects
to
find
after
travelling
a
hundred
miles
in
answer
to
an
i
said
come
if
you
and
i
did
wish
you
give
me
a
cold
i
could
not
take
you
to
the
house
questions
would
be
asked
which
i
could
not
answer
without
your
conscience
is
growing
to
have
a
certain
virgin
tenderness
he
said
in
a
low
melodious
voice
i
have
no
conscience
i
spoke
one
deliberate
lie
this
evening
i
said
the
man
who
had
come
looked
rough
we
had
best
not
have
him
in
the
house
therefore
i
brought
him
here
it
was
a
deliberate
lie
and
i
hate
lies
i
tell
them
if
i
must
but
they
hurt
well
you
do
not
tell
lies
to
yourself
at
all
events
you
are
candid
so
she
interrupted
him
you
got
my
short
letter
yes
that
is
why
i
come
you
sent
a
very
foolish
reply
you
must
take
it
back
who
is
this
fellow
you
talk
of
marrying
a
young
lives
here
yes
he
has
gone
to
town
to
get
things
for
our
what
kind
of
a
fellow
is
he
a
and
you
would
rather
marry
him
than
me
yes
because
you
are
not
that
is
a
novel
reason
for
refusing
to
marry
a
man
he
said
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
watching
her
keenly
it
is
a
wise
one
she
said
shortly
if
i
marry
him
i
shall
shake
him
off
my
hand
when
it
suits
me
if
i
remained
with
him
for
twelve
months
he
would
never
have
dared
to
kiss
my
hand
as
far
as
i
wish
he
should
come
he
comes
and
no
further
would
you
ask
me
what
you
might
and
what
you
might
not
do
her
companion
raised
the
moustache
with
a
caressing
movement
from
his
lip
and
smiled
it
was
not
a
question
that
stood
in
need
of
any
answer
why
do
you
wish
to
enter
on
this
semblance
of
marriage
because
there
is
only
one
point
on
which
i
have
a
conscience
i
have
told
you
then
why
not
marry
me
because
if
once
you
have
me
you
would
hold
me
fast
i
shall
never
be
free
she
drew
a
long
low
breath
what
have
you
done
with
the
ring
i
gave
you
he
said
sometimes
i
wear
it
then
i
take
it
off
and
wish
to
throw
it
into
the
fire
the
next
day
i
put
it
on
again
and
sometimes
i
kiss
so
you
do
love
me
a
little
if
you
were
not
something
more
to
me
than
any
other
man
in
the
world
do
you
think
she
paused
i
love
you
when
i
see
you
but
when
you
are
away
from
me
i
hate
then
i
fear
i
must
be
singularly
invisible
at
the
present
moment
he
said
possibly
if
you
were
to
look
less
fixedly
into
the
fire
you
might
perceive
he
moved
his
chair
slightly
so
as
to
come
between
her
and
the
firelight
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
face
if
you
do
love
me
he
asked
her
why
will
you
not
marry
me
because
if
i
had
been
married
to
you
for
a
year
i
should
have
come
to
my
senses
and
seen
that
your
hands
and
your
voice
are
like
the
hands
and
the
voice
of
any
other
man
i
can
not
quite
see
that
now
but
it
is
all
madness
you
call
into
activity
one
part
of
my
nature
there
is
a
higher
part
that
you
know
nothing
of
that
you
never
touch
if
i
married
you
afterward
it
would
arise
and
assert
itself
and
i
should
hate
you
always
as
i
do
now
i
like
you
when
you
grow
metaphysical
and
analytical
he
said
leaning
his
face
upon
his
hand
go
a
little
further
in
your
analysis
say
i
love
you
with
the
right
ventricle
of
my
heart
but
not
the
left
and
with
the
left
auricle
of
my
heart
but
not
the
right
and
this
being
the
case
my
affection
for
you
is
not
of
a
duly
elevated
intellectual
and
spiritual
i
like
you
when
you
get
she
looked
quietly
at
him
he
was
trying
to
turn
her
own
weapons
against
her
you
are
acting
foolishly
lyndall
he
said
suddenly
changing
his
manner
and
speaking
earnestly
most
foolishly
you
are
acting
like
a
little
child
i
am
surprised
at
you
it
is
all
very
well
to
have
ideals
and
theories
but
you
know
as
well
as
any
one
can
that
they
must
not
be
carried
into
the
practical
world
i
love
you
i
do
not
pretend
that
it
is
in
any
high
superhuman
sense
i
do
not
say
that
i
should
like
you
as
well
if
you
were
ugly
and
deformed
or
that
i
should
continue
to
prize
you
whatever
your
treatment
of
me
might
be
or
to
love
you
though
you
were
a
spirit
without
any
body
at
all
that
is
sentimentality
for
beardless
boys
every
one
not
a
mere
child
and
you
are
not
a
child
except
in
years
knows
what
love
between
a
man
and
a
woman
means
i
love
you
with
that
love
i
should
not
have
believed
it
possible
that
i
could
have
brought
myself
twice
to
ask
of
any
woman
to
be
my
wife
more
especially
one
without
wealth
without
position
and
who
yes
go
on
do
not
grow
sorry
for
me
say
what
you
were
going
to
who
has
put
herself
into
my
power
and
who
has
lost
the
right
of
meeting
me
on
equal
say
what
you
think
at
least
we
two
may
speak
the
truth
to
one
then
she
added
after
a
pause
i
believe
you
do
love
me
as
much
as
you
possibly
could
love
anything
and
i
believe
that
when
you
ask
me
to
marry
you
you
are
performing
the
most
generous
act
you
ever
have
performed
in
the
course
of
your
life
or
ever
will
but
at
the
same
time
if
i
had
required
your
generosity
it
would
not
have
been
shown
me
if
when
i
got
your
letter
a
month
ago
hinting
at
your
willingness
to
marry
me
i
had
at
once
written
imploring
you
to
come
you
would
have
read
the
letter
poor
little
devil
you
would
have
said
and
tore
it
up
the
next
week
you
would
have
sailed
for
europe
and
have
sent
me
a
check
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
which
i
would
have
thrown
in
the
fire
and
i
would
have
heard
no
more
of
the
stranger
smiled
but
because
i
declined
your
proposal
and
wrote
that
in
three
weeks
i
should
be
married
to
another
then
what
you
call
love
woke
up
your
man
s
love
is
a
child
s
love
for
butterflies
you
follow
till
you
have
the
thing
and
break
it
if
you
have
broken
one
wing
and
the
thing
flies
still
then
you
love
it
more
than
ever
and
follow
till
you
break
both
then
you
are
satisfied
when
it
lies
still
on
the
you
are
profoundly
wise
in
the
ways
of
the
world
you
have
seen
far
into
life
he
said
he
might
as
well
have
sneered
at
the
firelight
i
have
seen
enough
to
tell
me
that
you
love
me
because
you
can
not
bear
to
be
resisted
and
want
to
master
me
you
liked
me
at
first
because
i
treated
you
and
all
men
with
indifference
you
resolved
to
have
me
because
i
seemed
unattainable
this
is
all
your
love
he
felt
a
strong
inclination
to
stoop
down
and
kiss
the
little
lips
that
defied
him
but
he
restrained
himself
he
said
quietly
and
you
loved
me
because
you
are
strong
you
are
the
first
man
i
ever
was
afraid
of
and
a
dreamy
look
came
into
her
face
because
i
like
to
experience
i
like
to
try
you
don
t
understand
he
smiled
well
since
you
will
not
marry
me
may
i
inquire
what
your
intentions
are
the
plan
you
wrote
of
you
asked
me
to
come
and
hear
it
and
i
have
i
said
come
if
you
if
you
agree
to
it
well
if
not
i
marry
on
well
she
was
still
looking
beyond
him
at
the
fire
i
can
not
marry
you
she
said
slowly
because
i
can
not
be
tied
but
if
you
wish
you
may
take
me
away
with
you
and
take
care
of
me
then
when
we
do
not
love
any
more
we
can
say
i
will
not
go
down
country
she
added
i
will
not
go
to
europe
you
must
take
me
to
the
transvaal
that
is
out
of
the
world
people
we
meet
there
we
need
not
see
again
in
our
future
oh
my
darling
he
said
bending
tenderly
and
holding
his
hand
out
to
her
why
will
you
not
give
yourself
entirely
to
me
one
day
you
will
desert
me
and
go
to
she
shook
her
head
without
looking
at
him
no
life
is
too
long
but
i
will
go
with
when
tomorrow
i
have
told
them
that
before
daylight
i
go
to
the
next
farm
i
will
write
from
the
town
and
tell
them
the
facts
i
do
not
want
them
to
trouble
me
i
want
to
shake
myself
free
of
these
old
surroundings
i
want
them
to
lose
sight
of
me
you
can
understand
that
is
necessary
for
he
seemed
lost
in
consideration
then
he
said
it
is
better
to
have
you
on
those
conditions
than
not
at
all
if
you
will
have
it
let
it
be
he
sat
looking
at
her
on
her
face
was
the
weary
look
that
rested
there
so
often
now
when
she
sat
alone
two
months
had
not
passed
since
they
parted
but
the
time
had
set
its
mark
on
her
he
looked
at
her
carefully
from
the
brown
smooth
head
to
the
little
crossed
feet
on
the
floor
a
worn
look
had
grown
over
the
little
face
and
it
made
its
charm
for
him
stronger
for
pain
and
time
which
trace
deep
lines
and
write
a
story
on
a
human
face
have
a
strangely
different
effect
on
one
face
and
another
the
face
that
is
only
fair
even
very
fair
they
mar
and
flaw
but
to
the
face
whose
beauty
is
the
harmony
between
that
which
speaks
from
within
and
the
form
through
which
it
speaks
power
is
added
by
all
that
causes
the
outer
man
to
bear
more
deeply
the
impress
of
the
inner
the
pretty
woman
fades
with
the
roses
on
her
cheeks
and
the
girlhood
that
lasts
an
hour
the
beautiful
woman
finds
her
fullness
of
bloom
only
when
a
past
has
written
itself
on
her
and
her
power
is
then
most
irresistible
when
it
seems
going
from
under
their
lids
the
keen
eyes
looked
down
at
her
her
shoulders
were
bent
for
a
moment
the
little
figure
had
forgotten
its
queenly
bearing
and
drooped
wearily
the
wide
dark
eyes
watched
the
fire
very
softly
it
certainly
was
not
in
her
power
to
resist
him
nor
any
strength
in
her
that
made
his
own
at
that
moment
grow
soft
as
he
looked
at
her
he
touched
one
little
hand
that
rested
on
her
knee
poor
little
thing
he
said
you
are
only
a
she
did
not
draw
her
hand
away
from
his
and
looked
up
at
him
you
are
very
tired
she
looked
into
his
eyes
as
a
little
child
might
whom
a
long
day
s
play
had
saddened
he
lifted
her
gently
up
and
sat
her
on
his
knee
poor
little
thing
he
said
she
turned
her
face
to
his
shoulder
and
buried
it
against
his
neck
he
wound
his
strong
arm
about
her
and
held
her
close
to
him
when
she
had
sat
for
a
long
while
he
drew
with
his
hand
the
face
down
and
held
it
against
his
arm
he
kissed
it
and
then
put
it
back
in
its
old
don
t
you
want
to
talk
to
me
have
you
forgotten
the
night
in
the
avenue
he
could
feel
that
she
shook
her
head
do
you
want
to
be
quiet
now
they
sat
quite
still
excepting
that
only
sometimes
he
raised
her
fingers
softly
to
his
mouth
doss
who
had
been
asleep
in
the
corner
waking
suddenly
planted
himself
before
them
his
wiry
legs
moving
nervously
his
yellow
eyes
filled
with
anxiety
he
was
not
at
all
sure
that
she
was
not
being
retained
in
her
present
position
against
her
will
and
was
not
a
little
relieved
when
she
sat
up
and
held
out
her
hand
for
the
shawl
i
must
go
she
said
the
stranger
wrapped
the
shawl
very
carefully
about
her
keep
it
close
around
your
face
lyndall
it
is
very
damp
outside
shall
i
walk
with
you
to
the
house
no
lie
down
and
rest
i
will
come
and
wake
you
at
three
o
she
lifted
her
face
that
he
might
kiss
it
and
when
he
had
kissed
it
once
she
still
held
it
that
he
might
kiss
it
again
then
he
let
her
out
he
had
seated
himself
at
the
fireplace
when
she
reopened
the
door
have
you
forgotten
anything
she
gave
one
long
lingering
look
at
the
old
room
when
she
was
gone
and
the
door
shut
the
stranger
filled
his
glass
and
sat
at
the
table
sipping
it
thoughtfully
the
night
outside
was
misty
and
damp
the
faint
moonlight
trying
to
force
its
way
through
the
thick
air
made
darkly
visible
the
outlines
of
the
buildings
the
stones
and
walls
were
moist
and
now
and
then
a
drop
slowly
collecting
fell
from
the
eaves
to
the
ground
doss
not
liking
the
change
from
the
cabin
s
warmth
ran
quickly
to
the
kitchen
doorstep
but
his
mistress
walked
slowly
past
him
and
took
her
way
up
the
winding
footpath
that
ran
beside
the
stone
wall
of
the
camps
when
she
came
to
the
end
of
the
last
camp
she
threaded
her
way
among
the
stones
and
bushes
till
she
reached
the
german
s
grave
why
she
had
come
there
she
hardly
knew
she
stood
looking
down
suddenly
she
bent
and
put
one
hand
on
the
face
of
a
wet
stone
i
shall
never
come
to
you
again
she
said
then
she
knelt
on
the
ground
and
leaned
her
face
upon
the
stones
dear
old
man
good
old
man
i
am
so
tired
she
said
for
we
will
come
to
the
dead
to
tell
secrets
we
would
never
have
told
to
the
living
i
am
so
tired
there
is
light
there
is
warmth
she
wailed
why
am
i
alone
so
hard
so
cold
i
am
so
weary
of
myself
it
is
eating
my
soul
to
its
core
self
self
self
i
can
not
bear
this
life
i
can
not
breathe
i
can
not
live
will
nothing
free
me
from
myself
she
pressed
her
cheek
against
the
wooden
post
i
want
to
love
i
want
something
great
and
pure
to
lift
me
to
itself
dear
old
man
i
can
not
bear
it
any
more
i
am
so
cold
so
hard
so
hard
will
no
one
help
me
the
water
gathered
slowly
on
her
shawl
and
fell
on
to
the
wet
stones
but
she
lay
there
crying
bitterly
for
so
the
living
soul
will
cry
to
the
dead
and
the
creature
to
its
god
and
of
all
this
crying
there
comes
nothing
the
lifting
up
of
the
hands
brings
no
salvation
redemption
is
from
within
and
neither
from
god
nor
man
it
is
wrought
out
by
the
soul
itself
with
suffering
and
through
time
doss
on
the
kitchen
doorstep
shivered
and
wondered
where
his
mistress
stayed
so
long
and
once
sitting
sadly
there
in
the
damp
he
had
dropped
asleep
and
dreamed
that
old
otto
gave
him
a
piece
of
bread
and
patted
him
on
the
head
and
when
he
woke
his
teeth
chattered
and
he
moved
to
another
stone
to
see
if
it
was
drier
at
last
he
heard
his
mistress
step
and
they
went
into
the
house
together
she
lit
a
candle
and
walked
to
the
s
bedroom
on
a
nail
under
the
lady
in
pink
hung
the
key
of
the
wardrobe
she
took
it
down
and
opened
the
great
press
from
a
little
drawer
she
took
fifty
pounds
all
she
had
in
the
world
relocked
the
door
and
turned
to
hang
up
the
key
the
marks
of
tears
were
still
on
her
face
but
she
smiled
then
she
paused
hesitated
fifty
pounds
for
a
lover
a
noble
reward
she
said
and
opened
the
wardrobe
and
returned
the
notes
to
the
drawer
where
em
might
find
them
once
in
her
own
room
she
arranged
the
few
articles
she
intended
to
take
tomorrow
burnt
her
old
letters
and
then
went
back
to
the
front
room
to
look
at
the
time
there
were
two
hours
yet
before
she
must
call
him
she
sat
down
at
the
to
wait
and
leaned
her
elbows
on
it
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
the
glass
reflected
the
little
brown
head
with
its
even
parting
and
the
tiny
hands
on
which
it
rested
one
day
i
will
love
something
utterly
and
then
i
will
be
better
she
said
once
presently
she
looked
up
the
large
dark
eyes
from
the
glass
looked
back
at
her
she
looked
deep
into
them
we
are
all
alone
you
and
i
she
whispered
no
one
helps
us
no
one
understands
us
but
we
will
help
the
eyes
looked
back
at
her
there
was
a
world
of
assurance
in
their
still
depths
so
they
had
looked
at
her
ever
since
she
could
remember
when
it
was
but
a
small
child
s
face
above
a
blue
pinafore
we
shall
never
be
quite
alone
you
and
i
she
said
we
shall
always
be
together
as
we
were
when
we
were
the
beautiful
eyes
looked
into
the
depths
of
her
soul
we
are
not
afraid
we
will
help
ourselves
she
said
she
stretched
out
her
hand
and
pressed
it
over
them
on
the
glass
dear
eyes
we
will
never
be
quite
alone
till
they
part
us
till

chapter
gregory
rose
has
an
idea
gregory
rose
was
in
the
loft
putting
it
neat
outside
the
rain
poured
a
six
months
drought
had
broken
and
the
thirsty
plain
was
drenched
with
water
what
it
could
not
swallow
ran
off
in
mad
rivulets
to
the
great
sloot
that
now
foamed
like
an
angry
river
across
the
flat
even
the
little
furrow
between
the
farmhouse
and
the
kraals
was
now
a
stream
which
almost
bore
away
the
kaffer
women
who
crossed
it
it
had
rained
for
hours
and
still
the
rain
poured
on
the
fowls
had
collected
a
melancholy
crowd
in
and
about
the
and
the
solitary
gander
who
alone
had
survived
the
six
months
want
of
water
walked
hither
and
thither
printing
his
webbed
footmarks
on
the
mud
to
have
them
washed
out
the
next
instant
by
the
pelting
rain
which
at
eleven
o
clock
still
beat
on
the
walls
and
roofs
with
unabated
ardour
gregory
as
he
worked
in
the
loft
took
no
notice
of
it
beyond
stuffing
a
sack
into
the
broken
pane
to
keep
it
out
and
in
spite
of
the
pelt
and
patter
em
s
clear
voice
might
be
heard
through
the
open
from
the
dining
room
where
she
sat
at
work
singing
the
blue
water
and
take
me
away
and
take
me
away
and
take
me
away
to
the
blue
water
that
quaint
childish
song
of
the
people
that
has
a
world
of
sweetness
and
sad
vague
yearning
when
sung
over
and
over
dreamily
by
a
woman
s
voice
as
she
sits
alone
at
her
work
but
gregory
heard
neither
that
nor
yet
the
loud
laughter
of
the
kaffer
maids
that
every
now
and
again
broke
through
from
the
kitchen
where
they
joked
and
worked
of
late
gregory
had
grown
strangely
impervious
to
the
sounds
and
sights
about
him
his
lease
had
run
out
but
em
had
said
do
not
renew
it
i
need
one
to
help
me
just
stay
and
she
had
added
you
must
not
remain
in
your
own
little
house
live
with
me
you
can
look
after
my
ostriches
better
and
gregory
did
not
thank
her
what
difference
did
it
make
to
him
paying
rent
or
not
living
there
or
not
it
was
all
one
but
yet
he
came
em
wished
that
he
would
still
sometimes
talk
of
the
strength
of
the
of
man
but
gregory
was
as
one
smitten
on
the
she
might
do
what
she
pleased
he
would
find
no
fault
had
no
word
to
say
he
had
forgotten
that
it
is
man
s
right
to
rule
on
that
rainy
morning
he
had
lighted
his
pipe
at
the
kitchen
fire
and
when
breakfast
was
over
stood
in
the
front
door
watching
the
water
rush
down
the
road
till
the
pipe
died
out
in
his
mouth
em
saw
she
must
do
something
for
him
and
found
him
a
large
calico
duster
he
had
sometimes
talked
of
putting
the
loft
neat
and
today
she
could
find
nothing
else
for
him
to
do
so
she
had
the
ladder
put
to
the
that
he
need
not
go
out
in
the
wet
and
gregory
with
the
broom
and
duster
mounted
to
the
loft
once
at
work
he
worked
hard
he
dusted
down
the
very
rafters
and
cleaned
the
broken
and
bent
forks
that
had
stuck
in
the
thatch
for
twenty
years
he
placed
the
black
bottles
neatly
in
rows
on
an
old
box
in
the
corner
and
piled
the
skins
on
one
another
and
sorted
the
rubbish
in
all
the
boxes
and
at
eleven
o
clock
his
work
was
almost
done
he
seated
himself
on
the
which
had
once
held
waldo
s
books
and
proceeded
to
examine
the
contents
of
another
which
he
had
not
yet
looked
at
it
was
carelessly
nailed
down
he
loosened
one
plank
and
began
to
lift
out
various
articles
of
female
attire
caps
aprons
dresses
with
long
pointed
bodies
such
as
he
remembered
to
have
seen
his
mother
wear
when
he
was
a
little
child
he
shook
them
out
carefully
to
see
there
were
no
moths
and
then
sat
down
to
fold
them
up
again
one
by
one
they
had
belonged
to
em
s
mother
and
the
box
as
packed
at
her
death
had
stood
untouched
and
forgotten
these
long
years
she
must
have
been
a
tall
woman
that
mother
of
em
s
for
when
he
stood
up
to
shake
out
a
dress
the
neck
was
on
a
level
with
his
and
the
skirt
touched
the
ground
gregory
laid
a
nightcap
out
on
his
knee
and
began
rolling
up
the
strings
but
presently
his
fingers
moved
slower
and
slower
then
his
chin
rested
on
his
breast
and
finally
the
imploring
blue
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
frill
abstractedly
when
em
s
voice
called
to
him
from
the
foot
of
the
ladder
he
started
and
threw
the
nightcap
behind
him
she
was
only
come
to
tell
him
that
his
cup
of
soup
was
ready
and
when
he
could
hear
that
she
was
gone
he
picked
up
the
nightcap
again
and
a
great
brown
just
such
a
kapje
and
such
a
dress
as
one
of
those
he
remembered
to
have
seen
a
sister
of
mercy
wear
gregory
s
mind
was
very
full
of
thought
he
took
down
a
fragment
of
an
old
from
behind
a
beam
and
put
the
kapje
on
his
beard
looked
somewhat
grotesque
under
it
he
put
up
his
hand
to
hide
it
that
was
better
the
blue
eyes
looked
out
with
the
mild
gentleness
that
became
eyes
looking
out
from
under
a
kapje
next
he
took
the
brown
dress
and
looking
round
furtively
slipped
it
over
his
head
he
had
just
got
his
arms
in
the
sleeves
and
was
trying
to
hook
up
the
back
when
an
increase
in
the
patter
of
the
rain
at
the
window
made
him
drag
it
off
hastily
when
he
perceived
there
was
no
one
coming
he
tumbled
the
things
back
into
the
box
and
covering
it
carefully
went
down
the
ladder
em
was
still
at
her
work
trying
to
adjust
a
new
needle
in
the
machine
gregory
drank
his
soup
and
then
sat
before
her
an
awful
and
mysterious
look
in
his
eyes
i
am
going
to
town
tomorrow
he
said
i
m
almost
afraid
you
won
t
be
able
to
go
said
em
who
was
intent
on
her
needle
i
don
t
think
it
is
going
to
leave
off
i
am
going
said
gregory
em
looked
up
but
the
sloots
are
as
full
as
rivers
you
can
not
go
we
can
wait
for
the
post
she
said
i
am
not
going
for
the
post
said
gregory
impressively
em
looked
for
explanation
none
came
when
will
you
be
back
i
am
not
coming
are
you
going
to
your
friends
gregory
waited
then
caught
her
by
the
wrist
look
here
em
he
said
between
his
teeth
i
can
t
stand
it
any
more
i
am
going
to
since
that
day
when
he
had
come
home
and
found
lyndall
gone
he
had
never
talked
of
her
but
em
knew
who
it
was
who
needed
to
be
spoken
of
by
no
name
she
said
when
he
had
released
her
hand
but
you
do
not
know
where
she
is
yes
i
do
she
was
in
bloemfontein
when
i
heard
last
i
will
go
there
and
i
will
find
out
where
she
went
then
and
then
and
then
i
will
have
em
turned
the
wheel
quickly
and
the
needle
sprung
into
twenty
fragments
gregory
she
said
she
does
not
want
us
she
told
us
so
clearly
in
the
letter
she
a
flush
rose
on
her
face
as
she
spoke
it
will
only
be
pain
to
you
gregory
will
she
like
to
have
you
near
her
there
was
an
answer
he
might
have
made
but
it
was
his
secret
and
he
did
not
choose
to
share
it
he
said
only
i
am
will
you
be
gone
long
gregory
i
do
not
know
perhaps
i
shall
never
come
back
do
what
you
please
with
my
things
i
can
not
stay
here
he
rose
from
his
seat
people
say
forget
forget
he
cried
pacing
the
room
they
are
mad
they
are
fools
do
they
say
so
to
men
who
are
dying
of
thirst
forget
forget
why
is
it
only
to
us
they
say
so
it
is
a
lie
to
say
that
time
makes
it
easy
it
is
afterward
afterward
that
it
eats
in
at
your
heart
all
these
months
he
cried
bitterly
i
have
lived
here
quietly
day
after
day
as
if
i
cared
for
what
i
ate
and
what
i
drank
and
what
i
did
i
care
for
nothing
i
can
not
bear
it
i
will
not
forget
forget
ejaculated
gregory
you
can
forget
all
the
world
but
you
can
not
forget
yourself
when
one
thing
is
more
to
you
than
yourself
how
are
you
to
forget
it
i
read
he
said
yes
and
then
i
come
to
a
word
she
used
and
it
is
all
back
with
me
again
i
go
to
count
my
sheep
and
i
see
her
face
before
me
and
i
stand
and
let
the
sheep
run
by
i
look
at
you
and
in
your
smile
a
something
at
the
corner
of
your
lips
i
see
her
how
can
i
forget
her
when
whenever
i
turn
she
is
there
and
not
there
i
can
not
i
will
not
live
where
i
do
not
see
her
i
know
what
you
think
he
said
turning
upon
her
you
think
i
am
mad
you
think
i
am
going
to
see
whether
she
will
not
like
me
i
am
not
so
foolish
i
should
have
known
at
first
she
never
could
suffer
me
who
am
i
what
am
i
that
she
should
look
at
me
it
was
right
that
she
left
me
right
that
she
should
not
look
at
me
if
any
one
says
it
is
not
it
is
a
lie
i
am
not
going
to
speak
to
her
he
added
only
to
see
her
only
to
stand
sometimes
in
a
place
where
she
has
stood
chapter
an
unfinished
letter
gregory
rose
had
been
gone
seven
months
em
sat
alone
on
a
white
sheepskin
before
the
fire
the
august
weird
and
shrill
howled
round
the
chimneys
and
through
the
crannies
and
in
walls
and
doors
and
uttered
a
long
low
cry
as
it
forced
its
way
among
the
clefts
of
the
stones
on
the
kopje
it
was
a
wild
night
the
tree
stiff
and
upright
as
it
held
its
arms
felt
the
wind
s
might
and
knocked
its
flat
leaves
heavily
together
till
great
branches
broke
off
the
kaffers
as
they
slept
in
their
straw
huts
whispered
one
to
another
that
before
morning
there
would
not
be
an
armful
of
thatch
left
on
the
roofs
and
the
beams
of
the
creaked
and
groaned
as
if
it
were
heavy
work
to
resist
the
importunity
of
the
wind
em
had
not
gone
to
bed
who
could
sleep
on
a
night
like
this
so
in
the
dining
room
she
had
lighted
a
fire
and
sat
on
the
ground
before
it
turning
the
that
lay
on
the
coals
to
bake
it
would
save
work
in
the
morning
and
she
blew
out
the
light
because
the
wind
through
the
made
it
flicker
and
run
and
she
sat
singing
to
herself
as
she
watched
the
cakes
they
lay
at
one
end
of
the
wide
hearth
on
a
bed
of
coals
and
at
the
other
end
a
fire
burnt
up
steadily
casting
its
amber
glow
over
em
s
light
hair
and
black
dress
with
the
ruffle
of
crepe
about
the
neck
and
over
the
white
curls
of
the
sheepskin
on
which
she
sat
louder
and
more
fiercely
yet
howled
the
storm
but
em
sang
on
and
heard
nothing
but
the
words
of
her
song
and
heard
them
only
faintly
as
something
restful
it
was
an
old
childish
song
she
had
often
heard
her
mother
sing
long
ago
where
the
reeds
dance
by
the
river
where
the
willow
s
song
is
said
on
the
face
of
the
morning
water
is
reflected
a
white
flower
s
head
she
folded
her
hands
and
sang
the
next
verse
dreamily
where
the
reeds
shake
by
the
river
where
the
moonlight
s
sheen
is
shed
on
the
face
of
the
sleeping
water
two
leaves
of
a
white
flower
float
dead
dead
dead
dead
she
echoed
the
refrain
softly
till
it
died
away
and
then
repeated
it
it
was
as
if
unknown
to
herself
it
harmonized
with
the
pictures
and
thoughts
that
sat
with
her
there
alone
in
the
firelight
she
turned
the
cakes
over
while
the
wind
hurled
down
a
row
of
bricks
from
the
gable
and
made
the
walls
tremble
presently
she
paused
and
listened
there
was
a
sound
as
of
something
knocking
at
the
but
the
wind
had
raised
its
level
higher
and
she
went
on
with
her
work
at
last
the
sound
was
repeated
then
she
rose
lit
the
candle
and
the
fire
and
went
to
see
only
to
satisfy
herself
she
said
that
nothing
could
be
out
on
such
a
night
she
opened
the
door
a
little
way
and
held
the
light
behind
her
to
defend
it
from
the
wind
the
figure
of
a
tall
man
stood
there
and
before
she
could
speak
he
had
pushed
his
way
in
and
was
forcing
the
door
to
close
behind
him
waldo
she
cried
in
astonishment
he
had
been
gone
more
than
a
year
and
a
half
you
did
not
expect
to
see
me
he
answered
as
he
turned
toward
her
i
should
have
slept
in
the
outhouse
and
not
troubled
you
tonight
but
through
the
shutter
i
saw
glimmerings
of
a
come
in
to
the
fire
she
said
it
is
a
terrific
night
for
any
creature
to
be
out
shall
we
not
go
and
fetch
your
things
in
first
she
added
i
have
nothing
but
this
he
said
motioning
to
the
little
bundle
in
his
hand
your
horse
is
he
sat
down
on
the
bench
before
the
fire
the
cakes
are
almost
ready
she
said
i
will
get
you
something
to
eat
where
have
you
been
wandering
all
this
while
up
and
down
up
and
down
he
answered
wearily
and
now
the
whim
has
seized
me
to
come
back
here
em
he
said
putting
his
hand
on
her
arm
as
she
passed
him
have
you
heard
from
lyndall
lately
yes
said
em
turning
quickly
from
him
where
is
she
i
had
one
letter
from
her
but
that
is
almost
a
year
ago
now
just
when
she
left
where

she
in
the
transvaal
i
will
go
and
get
you
some
supper

can
talk

you
give
me
her
exact
address
i
want
to
write
to
but
em
had
gone
into
the
next
room
when
food
was
on
the
table
she
knelt
down
before
the
fire
turning
the
cakes
babbling
restlessly
eagerly
now
of
this
now
of
that
she
was
glad
to
see
him
tant
sannie
was
coming
soon
to
show
her
her
new
baby
he
must
stay
on
the
farm
now
and
help
her
and
waldo
himself
was
well
content
to
eat
his
meal
in
silence
asking
no
more
questions
gregory
is
coming
back
next
week
she
said
he
will
have
been
gone
just
a
hundred
and
three
days
tomorrow
i
had
a
letter
from
him
where
has
he
been
but
his
companion
stooped
to
lift
a
cake
from
the
fire
how
the
wind
blows
one
can
hardly
hear
one
s
own
voice
she
said
take
this
warm
cake
no
one
s
cakes
are
like
mine
why
you
have
eaten
nothing
i
am
a
little
weary
he
said
the
wind
was
mad
he
folded
his
arms
and
rested
his
head
against
the
fireplace
whilst
she
removed
the
dishes
from
the
table
on
the
mantelpiece
stood
an
inkpot
and
some
sheets
of
paper
presently
he
took
them
down
and
turned
up
the
corner
of
the
tablecloth
i
will
write
a
few
lines
he
said
till
you
are
ready
to
sit
down
and
em
as
she
shook
out
the
tablecloth
watched
him
bending
intently
over
his
paper
he
had
changed
much
his
face
had
grown
thinner
his
cheeks
were
almost
hollow
though
they
were
covered
by
a
dark
growth
of
beard
she
sat
down
on
the
skin
beside
him
and
felt
the
little
bundle
on
the
bench
it
was
painfully
small
and
soft
perhaps
it
held
a
shirt
and
a
book
but
nothing
more
the
old
black
hat
had
a
piece
of
unhemmed
muslin
twisted
round
it
and
on
his
elbow
was
a
large
patch
so
fixed
on
with
yellow
thread
that
her
heart
ached
only
his
hair
was
not
changed
and
hung
in
silky
beautiful
waves
almost
to
his
shoulders
tomorrow
she
would
take
the
ragged
edge
off
his
collar
and
put
a
new
band
round
his
hat
she
did
not
interrupt
him
but
she
wondered
how
it
was
that
he
sat
to
write
so
intently
after
his
long
weary
walk
he
was
not
tired
now
his
pen
hurried
quickly
and
restlessly
over
the
paper
and
his
eye
was
bright
presently
em
raised
her
hand
to
her
breast
where
lay
the
letter
yesterday
had
brought
her
soon
she
had
forgotten
him
as
entirely
as
he
had
forgotten
her
each
was
in
his
own
world
with
his
own
he
was
writing
to
lyndall
he
would
tell
her
all
he
had
seen
all
he
had
done
though
it
were
nothing
worth
relating
he
seemed
to
have
come
back
to
her
and
to
be
talking
to
her
now
he
sat
there
in
the
old
house
and
then
i
got
to
the
next
town
and
my
horse
was
tired
so
i
could
go
no
further
and
looked
for
work
a
shopkeeper
agreed
to
hire
me
as
salesman
he
made
me
sign
a
promise
to
remain
six
months
and
he
gave
me
a
little
empty
room
at
the
back
of
the
store
to
sleep
in
i
had
still
three
pounds
of
my
own
and
when
you
just
come
from
the
country
three
pounds
seems
a
great
deal
when
i
had
been
in
the
shop
three
days
i
wanted
to
go
away
again
a
clerk
in
a
shop
has
the
lowest
work
to
do
of
all
the
people
it
is
much
better
to
break
stones
you
have
the
blue
sky
above
you
and
only
the
stones
to
bend
to
i
asked
my
master
to
let
me
go
and
i
offered
to
give
him
my
two
pounds
and
the
bag
of
mealies
i
had
bought
with
the
other
pound
but
he
would
not
i
found
out
afterward
he
was
only
giving
me
half
as
much
as
he
gave
to
the
others
that
was
why
i
had
fear
when
i
looked
at
the
other
clerks
that
i
would
at
last
become
like
them
all
day
they
were
bowing
and
smirking
to
the
women
who
came
in
smiling
when
all
they
wanted
was
to
get
their
money
from
them
they
used
to
run
and
fetch
the
dresses
and
ribbons
to
show
them
and
they
seemed
to
me
like
worms
with
oil
on
there
was
one
respectable
thing
in
that
store
it
was
the
kaffer
storeman
his
work
was
to
load
and
unload
and
he
never
needed
to
smile
except
when
he
liked
and
he
never
told
lies
the
other
clerks
gave
me
the
name
of
old
salvation
but
there
was
one
person
i
liked
very
much
he
was
clerk
in
another
store
he
often
went
past
the
door
he
seemed
to
me
not
like
others
his
face
was
bright
and
fresh
like
a
little
child
s
when
he
came
to
the
shop
i
felt
i
liked
him
one
day
i
saw
a
book
in
his
pocket
and
that
made
me
feel
near
him
i
asked
him
if
he
was
fond
of
reading
and
he
said
yes
when
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
the
next
day
he
came
to
me
and
asked
me
if
i
did
not
feel
lonely
he
never
saw
me
going
out
with
the
other
fellows
he
would
come
and
see
me
that
evening
he
said
i
was
glad
and
bought
some
meat
and
flour
because
the
grey
mare
and
i
always
ate
mealies
it
is
the
cheapest
thing
when
you
boil
it
hard
you
can
t
eat
much
of
it
i
made
some
cakes
and
i
folded
my
great
coat
on
the
box
to
make
it
softer
for
him
and
at
last
he
came
you
ve
got
a
rummy
place
here
he
said
you
see
there
was
nothing
in
it
but
for
furniture
and
it
was
rather
empty
while
i
was
putting
the
food
on
the
box
he
looked
at
my
books
he
read
their
names
out
aloud
elementary
physiology
first
golly
he
said
i
ve
got
a
lot
of
dry
stuff
like
that
at
home
i
got
for
prizes
but
i
only
keep
them
to
light
my
pipe
with
now
they
come
in
handy
for
then
he
asked
me
if
i
had
ever
read
a
book
called
the
that
is
the
style
for
me
he
said
there
where
the
fellow
takes
the
by
the
arm
and
the
other
fellow
cuts
it
off
that
s
what
i
but
what
he
said
after
that
i
don
t
remember
only
it
made
me
feel
as
if
i
were
having
a
bad
dream
and
i
wanted
to
be
far
away
when
he
had
finished
eating
he
did
not
stay
long
he
had
to
go
and
see
some
girls
home
from
a
and
he
asked
how
it
was
he
never
saw
me
walking
out
with
any
on
sunday
afternoons
he
said
he
had
lots
of
sweethearts
and
he
was
going
to
see
one
the
next
wednesday
on
a
farm
and
he
asked
me
to
lend
my
mare
i
told
him
she
was
very
old
but
he
said
it
didn
t
matter
he
would
come
the
next
day
to
fetch
her
after
he
was
gone
my
little
room
got
back
to
its
old
look
i
loved
it
so
i
was
so
glad
to
get
into
it
at
night
and
it
seemed
to
be
reproaching
me
for
bringing
him
there
the
next
day
he
took
the
grey
mare
on
thursday
he
did
not
bring
her
back
and
on
friday
i
found
the
saddle
and
bridle
standing
at
my
door
in
the
afternoon
he
looked
into
the
shop
and
called
out
hope
you
got
your
saddle
farber
your
kicked
out
six
miles
from
here
i
ll
send
you
a
couple
of
shillings
tomorrow
though
the
old
hide
wasn
t
worth
it
good
but
i
sprung
over
the
counter
and
got
him
by
his
throat
my
father
was
so
gentle
with
her
he
never
would
ride
her
up
hill
and
now
this
fellow
had
murdered
her
i
asked
him
where
he
had
killed
her
and
i
shook
him
till
he
slipped
out
of
my
hand
he
stood
in
the
door
grinning
it
didn
t
take
much
to
kill
that
whose
master
sleeps
in
a
and
waits
till
his
company
s
finished
to
eat
on
the
plate
shouldn
t
wonder
if
you
fed
her
on
he
said
and
if
you
think
i
ve
jumped
her
you
d
better
go
and
look
yourself
you
ll
find
her
along
the
road
by
the
aasvogels
that
are
eating
i
caught
him
by
his
collar
and
i
lifted
him
from
the
ground
and
i
threw
him
out
into
the
street
across
it
i
heard
the
bookkeeper
say
to
the
clerk
that
there
was
always
the
devil
in
those
mum
fellows
but
they
never
called
me
salvation
after
that
i
am
writing
to
you
of
very
small
things
but
there
is
nothing
else
to
tell
it
has
been
all
small
and
you
will
like
it
whenever
anything
has
happened
i
have
always
thought
i
would
tell
it
to
you
the
back
thought
in
my
mind
is
always
you
after
that
only
one
old
man
came
to
visit
me
i
had
seen
him
in
the
streets
often
he
always
wore
very
dirty
black
clothes
and
a
hat
with
crepe
round
it
and
he
had
one
eye
so
i
noticed
him
one
day
he
came
to
my
room
with
a
for
a
minister
s
salary
when
i
said
i
had
nothing
to
give
he
looked
at
me
with
his
one
eye
young
man
he
said
how
is
it
i
never
see
you
in
the
house
of
the
lord
i
thought
he
was
trying
to
do
good
so
i
felt
sorry
for
him
and
i
told
him
i
never
went
to
chapel
young
man
he
said
it
grieves
me
to
hear
such
godless
words
from
the
lips
of
one
so
young
so
far
gone
in
the
paths
of
destruction
young
man
if
you
forget
god
god
will
forget
you
there
is
a
seat
on
the
side
as
you
go
at
the
bottom
door
that
you
may
get
if
you
are
given
over
to
the
enjoyment
and
frivolities
of
this
world
what
will
become
of
your
never
dying
soul
he
would
not
go
till
i
gave
him
half
a
crown
for
the
minister
s
salary
afterward
i
heard
he
was
the
man
who
collected
the
pew
rents
and
got
a
percentage
i
didn
t
get
to
know
any
one
else
when
my
time
in
that
shop
was
done
i
hired
myself
to
drive
one
of
a
s
wagons
that
first
morning
when
i
sat
in
the
front
and
called
to
my
oxen
and
saw
nothing
about
me
but
the
hills
with
the
blue
coming
down
to
them
and
the
karoo
bushes
i
was
drunk
i
laughed
my
heart
was
beating
till
it
hurt
me
i
shut
my
eyes
tight
that
when
i
opened
them
i
might
see
there
were
no
shelves
about
me
there
must
be
a
beauty
in
buying
and
selling
if
there
is
beauty
in
everything
but
it
is
very
ugly
to
me
my
life
as
would
have
been
the
best
life
in
the
world
if
i
had
had
only
one
wagon
to
drive
my
master
told
me
he
would
drive
one
i
the
other
and
he
would
hire
another
person
to
drive
the
third
but
the
first
day
i
drove
two
to
help
him
and
after
that
he
let
me
drive
all
three
whenever
we
came
to
an
hotel
he
stopped
behind
to
get
a
drink
and
when
he
rode
up
to
the
wagons
he
could
never
stand
the
hottentot
and
i
used
to
lift
him
up
we
always
travelled
all
night
and
used
to
outspan
for
five
or
six
hours
in
the
heat
of
the
day
to
rest
i
planned
that
i
would
lie
under
a
wagon
and
read
for
an
hour
or
two
every
day
before
i
went
to
sleep
and
i
did
for
the
first
two
or
three
but
after
that
i
only
wanted
to
sleep
like
the
rest
and
i
packed
my
books
away
when
you
have
three
wagons
to
look
after
all
night
you
are
sometimes
so
tired
you
can
hardly
stand
at
first
when
i
walked
along
driving
my
wagons
in
the
night
it
was
glorious
the
stars
had
never
looked
so
beautiful
to
me
and
on
the
dark
nights
when
we
rode
through
the
bush
there
were
dancing
on
each
side
of
the
road
i
found
out
that
even
the
damp
and
dark
are
beautiful
but
i
soon
changed
and
saw
nothing
but
the
road
and
my
oxen
i
only
wished
for
a
smooth
piece
of
road
so
that
i
might
sit
at
the
front
and
doze
at
the
places
where
we
outspanned
there
were
sometimes
rare
plants
and
flowers
the
festoons
hanging
from
the
and
nuts
and
insects
such
as
we
never
see
here
but
after
a
little
while
i
never
looked
at
them
i
was
too
tired
i
ate
as
much
as
i
could
and
then
lay
down
on
my
face
under
the
wagon
till
the
boy
came
to
wake
me
to
inspan
and
then
we
drove
on
again
all
night
so
it
went
so
it
went
i
think
sometimes
when
i
walked
by
my
oxen
i
called
to
them
in
my
sleep
for
i
know
i
thought
of
nothing
i
was
like
an
animal
my
body
was
strong
and
well
to
work
but
my
brain
was
dead
if
you
have
not
felt
it
lyndall
you
can
not
understand
it
you
may
work
and
work
and
work
till
you
are
only
a
body
not
a
soul
now
when
i
see
one
of
those
men
that
come
from
europe
navvies
with
the
sunken
face
different
from
any
kaffer
s
i
know
what
brought
that
look
into
their
eyes
and
if
i
have
only
one
inch
of
tobacco
i
give
them
half
it
is
work
grinding
mechanical
work
that
they
or
their
ancestors
have
done
that
has
made
them
into
beasts
you
may
work
a
man
s
body
so
that
his
soul
dies
work
is
good
i
have
worked
at
the
old
farm
from
the
sun
s
rising
till
its
setting
but
i
have
had
time
to
think
and
time
to
feel
you
may
work
a
man
so
that
all
but
the
animal
in
him
is
gone
and
that
grows
stronger
with
physical
labour
you
may
work
a
man
till
he
is
a
devil
i
know
it
because
i
have
felt
it
you
will
never
understand
the
change
that
came
over
me
no
one
but
i
will
ever
know
how
great
it
was
but
i
was
never
miserable
when
i
could
keep
my
oxen
from
sticking
fast
and
when
i
could
find
a
place
to
lie
down
in
i
had
all
i
wanted
after
i
had
driven
eight
months
a
rainy
season
came
for
eighteen
hours
out
of
the
we
worked
in
the
wet
the
mud
went
up
to
the
axles
sometimes
and
we
had
to
dig
the
wheels
out
and
we
never
went
far
in
a
day
my
master
swore
at
me
more
than
ever
but
when
he
had
done
he
always
offered
me
his
when
i
first
came
he
had
offered
it
me
and
i
had
always
refused
but
now
i
drank
as
my
oxen
did
when
i
gave
them
water
without
thinking
at
last
i
bought
brandy
for
myself
whenever
we
passed
an
hotel
one
sunday
we
outspanned
on
the
banks
of
a
swollen
river
to
wait
for
its
going
down
it
was
drizzling
still
so
i
lay
under
the
wagon
on
the
mud
there
was
no
dry
place
anywhere
and
all
the
dung
was
wet
so
there
was
no
fire
to
cook
food
my
little
flask
was
filled
with
brandy
and
i
drank
some
and
went
to
sleep
when
i
woke
it
was
drizzling
still
so
i
drank
some
more
i
was
stiff
and
cold
and
my
master
who
lay
by
me
offered
me
his
flask
because
mine
was
empty
i
drank
some
and
then
i
thought
i
would
go
and
see
if
the
river
was
going
down
i
remember
that
i
walked
to
the
road
and
it
seemed
to
be
going
away
from
me
when
i
woke
up
i
was
lying
by
a
little
bush
on
the
bank
of
the
river
it
was
afternoon
all
the
clouds
had
gone
and
the
sky
was
deep
blue
the
bushman
boy
was
grilling
ribs
at
the
fire
he
looked
at
me
and
grinned
from
ear
to
ear
master
was
a
little
nice
he
said
and
lay
down
in
the
road
something
might
ride
over
master
so
i
carried
him
he
grinned
at
me
again
it
was
as
though
he
said
you
and
i
are
comrades
i
have
lain
in
a
road
too
i
know
all
about
when
i
turned
my
head
from
him
i
saw
the
earth
so
pure
after
the
rain
so
green
so
fresh
so
blue
and
i
was
a
drunken
carrier
whom
his
leader
had
picked
up
in
the
mud
and
laid
at
the
roadside
to
sleep
out
his
drink
i
remember
my
old
life
and
i
remember
you
i
saw
how
one
day
you
would
read
in
the
papers
a
german
carrier
named
waldo
farber
was
killed
through
falling
from
his
wagon
being
instantly
crushed
under
the
wheel
deceased
was
supposed
to
have
been
drunk
at
the
time
of
the
there
are
those
notices
in
the
paper
every
month
i
sat
up
and
i
took
the
out
of
my
pocket
and
i
flung
it
as
far
as
i
could
into
the
dark
water
the
hottentot
boy
ran
down
to
see
if
he
could
catch
it
it
had
sunk
to
the
bottom
i
never
drank
again
but
lyndall
sin
looks
much
more
terrible
to
those
who
look
at
it
than
to
those
who
do
it
a
convict
or
a
man
who
drinks
seems
something
so
far
off
and
horrible
when
we
see
him
but
to
himself
he
seems
quite
near
to
us
and
like
us
we
wonder
what
kind
of
a
creature
he
is
but
he
is
just
we
ourselves
we
are
only
the
wood
the
knife
that
carves
on
us
is
the
circumstance
i
do
not
know
why
i
kept
on
working
so
hard
for
that
master
i
think
it
was
as
the
oxen
come
every
day
and
stand
by
the
yokes
they
do
not
know
why
perhaps
i
would
have
been
with
him
still
but
one
day
we
started
with
loads
for
the
diamond
fields
the
oxen
were
very
thin
now
and
they
had
been
standing
about
in
the
yoke
all
day
without
food
while
the
wagons
were
being
loaded
not
far
from
the
town
was
a
hill
when
we
came
to
the
foot
the
first
wagon
stuck
fast
i
tried
for
a
little
while
to
urge
the
oxen
but
i
soon
saw
the
one
span
could
never
pull
it
up
i
went
to
the
other
wagon
to
loosen
that
span
to
join
them
on
in
front
but
the
who
was
lying
at
the
back
of
the
wagon
jumped
out
they
shall
bring
it
up
the
hill
and
if
half
of
them
die
for
it
they
shall
do
it
alone
he
said
he
was
not
drunk
but
in
bad
temper
for
he
had
been
drunk
the
night
before
he
swore
at
me
and
told
me
to
take
the
whip
and
help
him
we
tried
for
a
little
time
then
i
told
him
it
was
no
use
they
could
never
do
it
he
swore
louder
and
called
to
the
leaders
to
come
on
with
their
whips
and
together
they
lashed
there
was
one
ox
a
black
ox
so
thin
that
the
ridge
of
his
backbone
almost
cut
through
his
flesh
it
is
you
devil
is
it
that
will
not
pull
the
said
i
will
show
you
he
looked
like
a
devil
he
told
the
boys
to
leave
off
flogging
and
he
held
the
ox
by
the
horn
and
took
up
a
round
stone
and
knocked
its
nose
with
it
till
the
blood
came
when
he
had
done
they
called
to
the
oxen
and
took
up
their
whips
again
and
the
oxen
strained
with
their
backs
bent
but
the
wagon
did
not
move
an
inch
so
you
won
t
won
t
you
he
said
i
ll
help
he
took
out
his
and
ran
it
into
the
leg
of
the
trembling
ox
three
times
up
to
the
hilt
then
he
put
the
knife
in
his
pocket
and
they
took
their
whips
the
oxen
s
flanks
quivered
and
they
foamed
at
the
mouth
straining
they
moved
the
wagon
a
few
feet
forward
then
stood
with
bent
backs
to
keep
it
from
sliding
back
from
the
black
ox
s
nostrils
foam
and
blood
were
streaming
on
to
the
ground
it
turned
its
head
in
its
anguish
and
looked
at
me
with
its
great
starting
eyes
it
was
praying
for
help
in
its
agony
and
weakness
and
they
took
their
whips
again
the
creature
bellowed
aloud
if
there
is
a
god
it
was
calling
to
its
maker
for
help
then
a
stream
of
clear
blood
burst
from
both
nostrils
it
fell
on
to
the
ground
and
the
wagon
slipped
back
the
man
walked
up
to
it
you
are
going
to
lie
down
devil
are
you
we
ll
see
you
don
t
take
it
too
the
thing
was
just
dying
he
opened
his
and
stooped
down
over
it
i
do
not
know
what
i
did
then
but
afterward
i
know
i
had
him
on
the
stones
and
i
was
kneeling
on
him
the
boys
dragged
me
off
i
wish
they
had
not
i
left
him
standing
in
the
sand
in
the
road
shaking
himself
and
i
walked
back
to
the
town
i
took
nothing
from
that
accursed
wagon
so
i
had
only
two
shillings
but
it
did
not
matter
the
next
day
i
got
work
at
a
wholesale
store
my
work
was
to
pack
and
unpack
goods
and
to
carry
boxes
and
i
had
to
work
from
six
in
the
morning
to
six
in
the
evening
so
i
had
plenty
of
time
i
hired
a
little
room
and
subscribed
to
a
library
so
i
had
everything
i
needed
and
in
the
week
of
christmas
holidays
i
went
to
see
the
sea
i
walked
all
night
lyndall
to
escape
the
heat
and
a
little
after
sunrise
i
got
to
the
top
of
a
high
hill
before
me
was
a
long
low
blue
monotonous
mountain
i
walked
looking
at
it
but
i
was
thinking
of
the
sea
i
wanted
to
see
at
last
i
wondered
what
that
curious
blue
thing
might
be
then
it
struck
me
it
was
the
sea
i
would
have
turned
back
again
only
i
was
too
tired
i
wonder
if
all
the
things
we
long
to
see
the
churches
the
pictures
the
men
in
europe
will
disappoint
us
so
you
see
i
had
dreamed
of
it
so
long
when
i
was
a
little
boy
minding
sheep
behind
the
kopje
i
used
to
see
the
waves
stretching
out
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
in
the
sunlight
my
sea
is
the
idea
always
more
beautiful
than
the
real
i
got
to
the
beach
that
afternoon
and
i
saw
the
water
run
up
and
down
on
the
sand
and
i
saw
the
white
foam
breakers
they
were
pretty
but
i
thought
i
would
go
back
the
next
day
it
was
not
my
sea
but
i
began
to
like
it
when
i
sat
by
it
that
night
in
the
moonlight
and
the
next
day
i
liked
it
better
and
before
i
left
i
loved
it
it
was
not
like
the
sky
and
stars
that
talk
of
what
has
no
beginning
and
no
end
but
it
is
so
human
of
all
the
things
i
have
ever
seen
only
the
sea
is
like
a
human
being
the
sky
is
not
nor
the
earth
but
the
sea
is
always
moving
always
something
deep
in
itself
is
stirring
it
it
never
rests
it
is
always
wanting
wanting
wanting
it
hurries
on
and
then
it
creeps
back
slowly
without
having
reached
moaning
it
is
always
asking
a
question
and
it
never
gets
the
answer
i
can
hear
it
in
the
day
and
in
the
night
the
white
foam
breakers
are
saying
that
which
i
think
i
walk
alone
with
them
when
there
is
no
one
to
see
me
and
i
sing
with
them
i
lie
down
on
the
sand
and
watch
them
with
my
eyes
half
shut
the
sky
is
better
but
it
is
so
high
above
our
heads
i
love
the
sea
sometimes
we
must
look
down
too
after
five
days
i
went
back
to
grahamstown
i
had
glorious
books
and
in
the
night
i
could
sit
in
my
little
room
and
read
them
but
i
was
lonely
books
are
not
the
same
things
when
you
are
living
among
people
i
can
not
tell
why
but
they
are
dead
on
the
farm
they
would
have
been
living
beings
to
me
but
here
where
there
were
so
many
people
about
me
i
wanted
some
one
to
belong
to
me
i
was
lonely
i
wanted
something
that
was
flesh
and
blood
once
on
this
farm
there
came
a
stranger
i
did
not
ask
his
name
but
he
sat
among
the
karoo
and
talked
with
me
now
wherever
i
have
travelled
i
have
looked
for
him
in
hotels
in
streets
in
passenger
wagons
as
they
rushed
in
through
the
open
windows
of
houses
i
have
looked
for
him
but
i
have
not
found
him
never
heard
a
voice
like
his
one
day
i
went
to
the
botanic
gardens
it
was
a
and
the
band
was
to
play
i
stood
in
the
long
raised
avenue
and
looked
down
there
were
many
flowers
and
ladies
and
children
were
walking
about
beautifully
dressed
at
last
the
music
began
i
had
not
heard
such
music
before
at
first
it
was
slow
and
even
like
the
everyday
life
when
we
walk
through
it
without
thought
or
feeling
then
it
grew
faster
then
it
paused
hesitated
then
it
was
quite
still
for
an
instant
and
then
it
burst
out
lyndall
they
made
heaven
right
when
they
made
it
all
music
it
takes
you
up
and
carries
you
away
away
till
you
have
the
things
you
longed
for
you
are
up
close
to
them
you
have
got
out
into
a
large
free
open
place
i
could
not
see
anything
while
it
was
playing
i
stood
with
my
head
against
my
tree
but
when
it
was
done
i
saw
that
there
were
ladies
sitting
close
to
me
on
a
wooden
bench
and
the
stranger
who
had
talked
to
me
that
day
in
the
karoo
was
sitting
between
them
the
ladies
were
very
pretty
and
their
dresses
beautiful
i
do
not
think
they
had
been
listening
to
the
music
for
they
were
talking
and
laughing
very
softly
i
heard
all
they
said
and
could
even
smell
the
rose
on
the
breast
of
one
i
was
afraid
he
would
see
me
so
i
went
to
the
other
side
of
the
tree
and
soon
they
got
up
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
in
the
avenue
all
the
time
the
music
played
they
chatted
and
he
carried
on
his
arm
the
scarf
of
the
prettiest
lady
i
did
not
hear
the
music
i
tried
to
catch
the
sound
of
his
voice
each
time
he
went
by
when
i
was
listening
to
the
music
i
did
not
know
i
was
badly
dressed
now
i
felt
so
ashamed
of
myself
i
never
knew
before
what
a
low
horrible
thing
i
was
dressed
in
tancord
that
day
on
the
farm
when
we
sat
on
the
ground
under
the
i
thought
he
quite
belonged
to
me
now
i
saw
he
was
not
mine
but
he
was
still
as
beautiful
his
brown
eyes
are
more
beautiful
than
any
one
s
eyes
except
yours
at
last
they
turned
to
go
and
i
walked
after
them
when
they
got
out
of
the
gate
he
helped
the
ladies
into
a
phaeton
and
stood
for
a
moment
with
his
foot
on
the
step
talking
to
them
he
had
a
little
cane
in
his
hand
and
an
italian
greyhound
ran
after
him
just
when
they
drove
away
one
of
the
ladies
dropped
her
whip
pick
it
up
fellow
she
said
and
when
i
brought
it
her
she
threw
sixpence
on
the
ground
i
might
have
gone
back
to
the
garden
then
but
i
did
not
want
music
i
wanted
clothes
and
to
be
fashionable
and
fine
i
felt
that
my
hands
were
coarse
and
that
i
was
vulgar
i
never
tried
to
see
him
again
i
stayed
in
my
situation
four
months
after
that
but
i
was
not
happy
i
had
no
rest
the
people
about
me
pressed
on
me
and
made
me
dissatisfied
i
could
not
forget
them
even
when
i
did
not
see
them
they
pressed
on
me
and
made
me
miserable
i
did
not
love
books
i
wanted
people
when
i
walked
home
under
the
shady
trees
in
the
street
i
could
not
be
happy
for
when
i
passed
the
houses
i
heard
music
and
saw
faces
between
the
curtains
i
did
not
want
any
of
them
but
i
wanted
some
one
for
mine
for
me
i
could
not
help
it
i
wanted
a
finer
life
only
one
day
something
made
me
happy
a
nurse
came
to
the
store
with
a
little
girl
belonging
to
one
of
our
clerks
while
the
maid
went
into
the
office
to
give
a
message
to
its
father
the
little
child
stood
looking
at
me
presently
she
came
close
to
me
and
peeped
up
into
my
face
nice
curls
pretty
curls
she
said
i
like
she
felt
my
hair
all
over
with
her
little
hands
when
i
put
out
my
arm
she
let
me
take
her
and
sit
her
on
my
knee
she
kissed
me
with
her
soft
mouth
we
were
happy
till
the
came
and
shook
her
and
asked
her
if
she
was
not
ashamed
to
sit
on
the
knee
of
that
strange
man
but
i
do
not
think
my
little
one
minded
she
laughed
at
me
as
she
went
out
if
the
world
was
all
children
i
could
like
it
but
men
and
women
draw
me
so
strangely
and
then
press
me
away
till
i
am
in
agony
i
was
not
meant
to
live
among
people
perhaps
some
day
when
i
am
grown
older
i
will
be
able
to
go
and
live
among
them
and
look
at
them
as
i
look
at
the
rocks
and
bushes
without
letting
them
disturb
me
and
take
myself
from
me
but
not
now
so
i
grew
miserable
a
kind
of
fever
seemed
to
eat
me
i
could
not
rest
or
read
or
think
so
i
came
back
here
i
knew
you
were
not
here
but
it
seemed
as
though
i
should
be
nearer
you
and
it
is
you
i
want
you
that
the
other
people
suggest
to
me
but
can
not
he
had
filled
all
the
sheets
he
had
taken
and
now
lifted
down
the
last
from
the
mantelpiece
em
had
dropped
asleep
and
lay
slumbering
peacefully
on
the
skin
before
the
fire
out
of
doors
the
storm
still
raged
but
in
a
fitful
manner
as
though
growing
half
weary
of
itself
he
bent
over
his
paper
again
with
eager
flushed
cheek
and
wrote
on
it
has
been
a
delightful
journey
this
journey
home
i
have
walked
on
foot
the
evening
before
last
when
it
was
just
sunset
i
was
a
little
footsore
and
thirsty
and
went
out
of
the
road
to
look
for
water
i
went
down
into
a
deep
little
kloof
some
trees
ran
along
the
bottom
and
i
thought
i
should
find
water
there
the
sun
had
quite
set
when
i
got
to
the
bottom
of
it
it
was
very
still
not
a
leaf
was
stirring
anywhere
in
the
bed
of
the
mountain
torrent
i
thought
i
might
find
water
i
came
to
the
bank
and
leaped
down
into
the
dry
bed
the
floor
on
which
i
stood
was
of
fine
white
sand
and
the
banks
rose
on
every
side
like
the
walls
of
a
room
above
there
was
a
precipice
of
rocks
and
a
tiny
stream
of
water
oozed
from
them
and
fell
slowly
on
to
the
flat
stone
below
each
drop
you
could
hear
fall
like
a
little
silver
bell
there
was
one
among
the
trees
on
the
bank
that
stood
cut
out
against
the
white
sky
all
the
other
trees
were
silent
but
this
one
shook
and
trembled
against
the
sky
everything
else
was
still
but
those
leaves
were
quivering
quivering
i
stood
on
the
sand
i
could
not
go
away
when
it
was
quite
dark
and
the
stars
had
come
i
crept
out
does
it
seem
strange
to
you
that
it
should
have
made
me
so
happy
it
is
because
i
can
not
tell
you
how
near
i
felt
to
things
that
we
can
not
see
but
we
always
feel
tonight
has
been
a
wild
stormy
night
i
have
been
walking
across
the
plain
for
hours
in
the
dark
i
have
liked
the
wind
because
i
have
seemed
forcing
my
way
through
to
you
i
knew
you
were
not
here
but
i
would
hear
of
you
when
i
used
to
sit
on
the
transport
wagon
i
used
to
start
awake
because
your
hands
were
on
me
in
my
lodgings
many
nights
i
have
blown
the
light
out
and
sat
in
the
dark
that
i
might
see
your
face
start
out
more
distinctly
sometimes
it
was
the
little
girl
s
face
who
used
to
come
to
me
behind
the
kopje
when
i
minded
sheep
and
sit
by
me
in
her
blue
pinafore
sometimes
it
was
older
i
love
both
i
am
very
helpless
i
shall
never
do
anything
but
you
will
work
and
i
will
take
your
work
for
mine
sometimes
such
a
sudden
gladness
seizes
me
when
i
remember
that
somewhere
in
the
world
you
are
living
and
working
you
are
my
very
own
nothing
else
is
my
own
so
when
i
have
finished
i
am
going
to
look
at
your
room
door
he
wrote
and
the
wind
which
had
spent
its
fury
moaned
round
and
round
the
house
most
like
a
tired
child
weary
with
crying
em
woke
up
and
sat
before
the
fire
rubbing
her
eyes
and
listening
as
it
sobbed
about
the
gables
and
wandered
away
over
the
long
stone
walls
how
quiet
it
has
grown
now
she
said
and
sighed
herself
partly
from
weariness
and
partly
from
sympathy
with
the
tired
wind
he
did
not
answer
her
he
was
lost
in
his
letter
she
rose
slowly
after
a
time
and
rested
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
you
have
many
letters
to
write
she
said
no
he
answered
it
is
only
one
to
she
turned
away
and
stood
long
before
the
fire
looking
into
it
if
you
have
a
deadly
fruit
to
give
it
will
not
grow
sweeter
by
keeping
waldo
dear
she
said
putting
her
hand
on
his
leave
off
he
threw
back
the
dark
hair
from
his
forehead
and
looked
at
her
it
is
no
use
writing
any
more
she
said
why
not
he
asked
she
put
her
hand
over
the
papers
he
had
written
waldo
she
said
lyndall
is
chapter
gregory
s
womanhood
slowly
over
the
flat
came
a
cart
on
the
back
seat
sat
gregory
his
arms
folded
his
hat
drawn
over
his
eyes
a
kaffer
boy
sat
on
the
front
seat
driving
and
at
his
feet
sat
doss
who
now
and
again
lifted
his
nose
and
eyes
above
the
level
of
the
splashboard
to
look
at
the
surrounding
country
and
then
with
an
exceedingly
knowing
wink
of
his
left
eye
turned
to
his
companions
thereby
intimating
that
he
clearly
perceived
his
whereabouts
no
one
noticed
the
cart
coming
waldo
who
was
at
work
at
his
carpenter
s
table
in
the
saw
nothing
till
chancing
to
look
down
he
perceived
doss
standing
before
him
the
legs
trembling
the
little
nose
wrinkled
and
a
series
of
short
suffocating
barks
giving
utterance
to
his
joy
at
reunion
em
whose
eyes
had
ached
with
looking
out
across
the
plain
was
now
at
work
in
a
back
room
and
knew
nothing
till
looking
up
she
saw
gregory
with
his
straw
hat
and
blue
eyes
standing
in
the
doorway
he
greeted
her
quietly
hung
his
hat
up
in
its
old
place
behind
the
door
and
for
any
change
in
his
manner
or
appearance
he
might
have
been
gone
only
the
day
before
to
fetch
letters
from
the
town
only
his
beard
was
gone
and
his
face
was
grown
thinner
he
took
off
his
leather
gaiters
said
the
afternoon
was
hot
and
the
roads
dusty
and
asked
for
some
tea
they
talked
of
wool
and
the
cattle
and
the
sheep
and
em
gave
him
the
pile
of
letters
that
had
come
for
him
during
the
months
of
absence
but
of
the
thing
that
lay
at
their
hearts
neither
said
anything
then
he
went
out
to
look
at
the
kraals
and
at
supper
em
gave
him
hot
cakes
and
coffee
they
talked
about
the
servants
and
then
ate
their
meal
in
quiet
she
asked
no
questions
when
it
was
ended
gregory
went
into
the
front
room
and
lay
in
the
dark
on
the
sofa
do
you
not
want
a
light
em
asked
venturing
to
look
in
no
he
answered
then
presently
called
to
her
come
and
sit
here
i
want
to
talk
to
she
came
and
sat
on
a
footstool
near
him
do
you
wish
to
hear
anything
he
asked
she
whispered
yes
if
it
does
not
hurt
what
difference
does
it
make
to
me
he
said
if
i
talk
or
am
silent
is
there
any
change
yet
he
lay
quiet
for
a
long
time
the
light
through
the
open
door
showed
him
to
her
where
he
lay
with
his
arm
thrown
across
his
eyes
at
last
he
spoke
perhaps
it
was
a
relief
to
him
to
speak
to
bloemfontein
in
the
free
state
to
which
through
an
agent
he
had
traced
them
gregory
had
gone
at
the
hotel
where
lyndall
and
her
stranger
had
stayed
he
put
up
he
was
shown
the
very
room
in
which
they
had
slept
the
coloured
boy
who
had
driven
them
to
the
next
town
told
him
in
which
house
they
had
boarded
and
gregory
went
on
in
that
town
he
found
they
had
left
the
cart
and
bought
a
spider
and
four
greys
and
gregory
s
heart
rejoiced
now
indeed
it
would
be
easy
to
trace
their
course
and
he
turned
his
steps
northward
at
the
farmhouses
where
he
stopped
the
ooms
and
tantes
remembered
clearly
the
spider
with
its
four
grey
horses
at
one
place
the
told
how
the
tall
englishman
had
bought
milk
and
asked
the
way
to
the
next
farm
at
the
next
farm
the
englishman
had
bought
a
bunch
of
flowers
and
given
half
a
crown
for
them
to
the
little
girl
it
was
quite
true
the
made
her
get
it
out
of
the
box
and
show
it
at
the
next
place
they
had
slept
here
they
told
him
that
the
great
bulldog
who
hated
all
strangers
had
walked
in
in
the
evening
and
laid
its
head
in
the
lady
s
lap
so
at
every
place
he
heard
something
and
traced
them
step
by
step
at
one
desolate
farm
the
boer
had
a
good
deal
to
tell
the
lady
had
said
she
liked
a
wagon
that
stood
before
the
door
without
asking
the
price
the
englishman
had
offered
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
for
the
old
thing
and
bought
oxen
worth
ten
pounds
for
sixteen
the
dutchman
chuckled
for
he
had
the
s
money
in
the
box
under
his
bed
gregory
laughed
too
in
silence
he
could
not
lose
sight
of
them
now
so
slowly
they
would
have
to
move
with
that
cumbrous
yet
when
that
evening
came
and
he
reached
a
little
wayside
inn
no
one
could
tell
him
anything
of
the
travellers
the
master
a
surly
creature
half
stupid
with
sat
on
the
bench
before
the
door
smoking
gregory
sat
beside
him
questioning
but
he
smoked
on
he
remembered
nothing
of
such
strangers
how
should
he
know
who
had
been
there
months
and
months
before
he
smoked
on
gregory
very
weary
tried
to
wake
his
memory
said
that
the
lady
he
was
seeking
for
was
very
beautiful
had
a
little
mouth
and
tiny
very
tiny
feet
the
man
only
smoked
on
as
sullenly
as
at
first
what
were
little
very
little
mouths
and
feet
to
him
but
his
daughter
leaned
out
in
the
window
above
she
was
dirty
and
lazy
and
liked
to
loll
there
when
travellers
came
to
hear
the
men
talk
but
she
had
a
soft
heart
presently
a
hand
came
out
of
the
window
and
a
pair
of
velvet
slippers
touched
his
shoulder
tiny
slippers
with
black
flowers
he
pulled
them
out
of
her
hand
only
one
woman
s
feet
had
worn
them
he
knew
that
left
here
last
summer
by
a
lady
said
the
girl
might
be
the
one
you
are
looking
for
never
saw
any
feet
so
gregory
rose
and
questioned
her
they
might
have
come
in
a
wagon
and
spider
she
could
not
tell
but
the
gentleman
was
very
handsome
tall
lovely
figure
blue
eyes
wore
gloves
always
when
he
went
out
an
english
officer
perhaps
no
africander
certainly
gregory
stopped
her
the
lady
well
she
was
pretty
rather
the
girl
said
very
cold
dull
air
silent
they
stayed
for
it
might
be
five
days
slept
in
the
wing
over
against
the
stoep
quarrelled
sometimes
she
thought
the
lady
she
had
seen
everything
when
she
went
in
to
wait
one
day
the
gentleman
touched
her
hair
she
drew
back
from
him
as
though
his
fingers
poisoned
her
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
if
he
came
to
sit
near
her
walked
out
alone
cold
wife
for
such
a
handsome
husband
the
girl
thought
she
evidently
pitied
him
he
was
such
a
beautiful
man
they
went
away
early
one
morning
how
or
in
which
way
the
girl
could
not
tell
gregory
inquired
of
the
servants
but
nothing
more
was
to
be
learnt
so
the
next
morning
he
saddled
his
horse
and
went
on
at
the
farms
he
came
to
the
good
old
ooms
and
tantes
asked
him
to
have
coffee
and
the
little
shoeless
children
peeped
out
at
the
stranger
from
behind
ovens
and
gables
but
no
one
had
seen
what
he
asked
for
this
way
and
that
he
rode
to
pick
up
the
thread
he
had
dropped
but
the
spider
and
the
wagon
the
little
lady
and
the
handsome
gentleman
no
one
had
seen
in
the
towns
he
fared
yet
worse
once
indeed
hope
came
to
him
on
the
stoep
of
an
hotel
at
which
he
stayed
the
night
in
a
certain
little
village
there
walked
a
gentleman
grave
and
it
was
not
hard
to
open
conversation
with
him
about
the
weather
and
then
had
he
ever
seen
such
and
such
people
a
gentleman
and
a
lady
a
spider
and
wagon
arrive
at
that
place
the
kindly
gentleman
shook
his
head
what
was
the
lady
like
he
inquired
gregory
painted
hair
like
silken
floss
small
mouth
underlip
very
full
and
pink
upper
lip
pink
but
very
thin
and
curled
there
were
four
white
spots
on
the
nail
of
her
right
hand
forefinger
and
her
eyebrows
were
very
delicately
curved
yes
and
a
tinge
in
the
cheeks
hands
like
lilies
and
perfectly
seraphic
that
is
she
that
is
she
cried
gregory
who
else
could
it
be
he
asked
where
she
had
gone
to
the
gentleman
most
thoughtfully
stroked
his
beard
he
would
try
to
remember
were
not
her
ears
here
such
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
seized
him
that
he
ran
away
into
the
house
an
clerk
and
a
dirty
barman
standing
in
the
doorway
laughed
aloud
gregory
wondered
if
they
could
be
laughing
at
the
gentleman
s
cough
and
then
he
heard
some
one
laughing
in
the
room
into
which
the
gentleman
had
gone
he
must
follow
him
and
try
to
learn
more
but
he
soon
found
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
learnt
there
poor
gregory
backward
and
forward
backward
and
forward
from
the
dirty
little
hotel
where
he
had
dropped
the
thread
to
this
farm
and
to
that
rode
gregory
till
his
heart
was
sick
and
tired
that
from
that
spot
the
wagon
might
have
gone
its
own
way
and
the
spider
another
was
an
idea
that
did
not
occur
to
him
at
last
he
saw
it
was
no
use
lingering
in
that
neighbourhood
and
pressed
on
one
day
coming
to
a
little
town
his
horses
knocked
up
and
he
resolved
to
rest
them
there
the
little
hotel
of
the
town
was
a
bright
and
sunny
place
like
the
jovial
face
of
the
clean
little
woman
who
kept
it
and
who
trotted
about
talking
always
talking
to
the
customers
in
the
taproom
and
to
the
maids
in
the
kitchen
and
to
the
when
she
could
hail
them
from
the
windows
talking
as
women
with
large
mouths
and
small
noses
always
do
in
season
and
out
there
was
a
little
front
parlour
in
the
hotel
kept
for
strangers
who
wanted
to
be
alone
gregory
sat
there
to
eat
his
breakfast
and
the
landlady
dusted
the
room
and
talked
of
the
great
finds
at
the
diamond
fields
and
the
badness
of
and
the
shameful
conduct
of
the
dutch
parson
in
that
town
to
the
english
inhabitants
gregory
ate
his
breakfast
and
listened
to
nothing
he
had
asked
his
one
question
and
had
had
his
answer
now
she
might
talk
on
presently
a
door
in
the
corner
opened
and
a
woman
came
out
a
mozambiquer
with
a
red
handkerchief
twisted
round
her
head
she
carried
in
her
hand
a
tray
with
a
slice
of
toast
crumbled
fine
and
a
cup
of
coffee
and
an
egg
broken
open
but
not
eaten
her
ebony
face
grinned
complacently
as
she
shut
the
door
softly
and
said
good
the
landlady
began
to
talk
to
her
you
are
not
going
to
leave
her
really
ayah
are
you
she
said
the
maids
say
so
but
i
m
sure
you
wouldn
t
do
such
a
the
mozambiquer
grinned
husband
says
i
must
go
but
she
hasn
t
got
any
one
else
and
won
t
have
any
one
else
come
now
said
the
landlady
i
ve
no
time
to
be
sitting
always
in
a
sickroom
not
if
i
was
paid
anything
for
the
mozambiquer
only
showed
her
white
teeth
for
answer
and
went
out
and
the
landlady
followed
her
gregory
glad
to
be
alone
watched
the
sunshine
as
it
came
over
the
fuchsias
in
the
window
and
ran
up
and
down
on
the
panelled
door
in
the
corner
the
mozambiquer
had
closed
it
loosely
behind
her
and
presently
something
touched
it
inside
it
moved
a
little
then
it
was
still
then
moved
again
then
through
the
gap
a
small
nose
appeared
and
a
yellow
ear
overlapping
one
eye
then
the
whole
head
obtruded
placed
itself
critically
on
one
side
wrinkled
its
nose
disapprovingly
at
gregory
and
withdrew
through
the
door
came
a
faint
scent
of
vinegar
and
the
room
was
dark
and
still
presently
the
landlady
came
back
left
the
door
open
she
said
bustling
to
shut
it
but
a
darky
will
be
a
darky
and
never
carries
a
head
on
its
shoulders
like
other
folks
not
ill
i
hope
sir
she
said
looking
at
gregory
when
she
had
shut
the
bedroom
door
no
said
gregory
the
landlady
began
putting
the
things
together
who
asked
gregory
is
in
that
room
glad
to
have
a
little
innocent
piece
of
gossip
to
relate
and
some
one
willing
to
hear
it
the
landlady
made
the
most
of
a
little
story
as
she
cleared
the
table
six
months
before
a
lady
had
come
alone
to
the
hotel
in
a
wagon
with
only
a
coloured
leader
and
driver
eight
days
after
a
little
baby
had
been
born
if
gregory
stood
up
and
looked
out
at
the
window
he
would
see
a
in
the
graveyard
close
by
it
was
a
little
grave
the
baby
was
buried
there
a
tiny
thing
only
lived
two
hours
and
the
mother
herself
almost
went
with
it
after
a
while
she
was
better
but
one
day
she
got
up
out
of
bed
dressed
herself
without
saying
a
word
to
any
one
and
went
out
it
was
a
drizzly
day
a
little
time
after
some
one
saw
her
sitting
on
the
wet
ground
under
the
with
the
rain
dripping
from
her
hat
and
shawl
they
went
to
fetch
her
but
she
would
not
come
until
she
chose
when
she
did
she
had
gone
to
bed
and
had
not
risen
again
from
it
never
would
the
doctor
said
she
was
very
patient
poor
thing
when
you
went
in
to
ask
her
how
she
was
she
said
always
better
or
nearly
well
and
lay
still
in
the
darkened
room
and
never
troubled
any
one
the
mozambiquer
took
care
of
her
and
she
would
not
allow
any
one
else
to
touch
her
would
not
so
much
as
allow
any
one
else
to
see
her
foot
uncovered
she
was
strange
in
many
ways
but
she
paid
well
poor
thing
and
now
the
mozambiquer
was
going
and
she
would
have
to
take
up
with
some
one
else
the
landlady
prattled
on
pleasantly
and
now
carried
away
the
tray
with
the
breakfast
things
when
she
was
gone
gregory
leaned
his
head
on
his
hands
but
he
did
not
think
long
before
dinner
he
had
ridden
out
of
the
town
to
where
on
a
rise
a
number
of
were
outspanned
the
dutchman
driver
of
one
wondered
at
the
stranger
s
eagerness
to
free
himself
of
his
horses
stolen
perhaps
but
it
was
worth
his
while
to
buy
them
at
so
low
a
price
so
the
horses
changed
masters
and
gregory
walked
off
with
his
saddlebags
slung
across
his
arm
once
out
of
sight
of
the
wagons
he
struck
out
of
the
road
and
walked
across
the
veld
the
dry
flowering
grasses
waving
everywhere
about
him
across
the
plain
he
came
to
a
deep
gully
which
the
rain
torrents
had
washed
out
but
which
was
now
dry
gregory
sprung
down
into
its
red
bed
it
was
a
safe
place
and
quiet
when
he
had
looked
about
him
he
sat
down
under
the
shade
of
an
overhanging
bank
and
fanned
himself
with
his
hat
for
the
afternoon
was
hot
and
he
had
walked
fast
at
his
feet
the
dusty
ants
ran
about
and
the
high
red
bank
before
him
was
covered
by
a
network
of
roots
and
fibres
washed
bare
by
the
rains
above
his
head
rose
the
clear
blue
african
sky
at
his
side
were
the
saddlebags
full
of
women
s
clothing
gregory
looked
up
half
plaintively
into
the
blue
sky
am
i
am
i
gregory
nazianzen
rose
he
said
it
was
also
strange
he
sitting
there
in
that
sloot
in
that
plain
strange
as
the
fantastic
changing
shapes
in
a
summer
cloud
at
last
tired
out
he
fell
asleep
with
his
head
against
the
bank
when
he
woke
the
shadow
had
stretched
across
the
sloot
and
the
sun
was
on
the
edge
of
the
plain
now
he
must
be
up
and
doing
he
drew
from
his
breast
pocket
a
little
sixpenny
and
hung
it
on
one
of
the
roots
that
stuck
out
from
the
bank
then
he
dressed
himself
in
one
of
the
gowns
and
a
great
collar
then
he
took
out
a
razor
tuft
by
tuft
the
soft
brown
beard
fell
down
into
the
sand
and
the
little
ants
took
it
to
line
their
nests
with
then
the
glass
showed
a
face
surrounded
by
a
frilled
cap
white
as
a
woman
s
with
a
little
mouth
a
very
short
upper
lip
and
a
receding
chin
presently
a
rather
tall
woman
s
figure
was
making
its
way
across
the
veld
as
it
passed
a
antheap
it
knelt
down
and
stuffed
in
the
saddlebags
with
the
man
s
clothing
closing
up
the
anthill
with
bits
of
ground
to
look
as
natural
as
possible
like
a
sinner
hiding
his
deed
of
sin
the
hider
started
once
and
looked
round
but
yet
there
was
no
one
near
save
a
meerkat
who
had
lifted
herself
out
of
her
hole
and
sat
on
her
hind
legs
watching
he
did
not
like
that
even
she
should
see
and
when
he
rose
she
dived
away
into
her
hole
then
he
walked
on
leisurely
that
the
dusk
might
have
reached
the
village
streets
before
he
walked
there
the
first
house
was
the
smith
s
and
before
the
open
door
two
idle
urchins
lolled
as
he
hurried
up
the
street
in
the
gathering
gloom
he
heard
them
laugh
long
and
loudly
behind
him
he
glanced
round
fearingly
and
would
almost
have
fled
but
that
the
strange
skirts
clung
about
his
legs
and
after
all
it
was
only
a
spark
that
had
alighted
on
the
head
of
one
and
not
the
strange
figure
they
laughed
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
stood
wide
open
and
the
light
fell
out
into
the
street
he
knocked
and
the
landlady
came
she
peered
out
to
look
for
the
cart
that
had
brought
the
traveller
but
gregory
s
heart
was
brave
now
he
was
so
near
the
quiet
room
he
told
her
he
had
come
with
the
transport
wagons
that
stood
outside
the
town
he
had
walked
in
and
wanted
lodgings
for
the
night
it
was
a
deliberate
lie
glibly
told
he
would
have
told
fifty
though
the
recording
angel
had
stood
in
the
next
room
with
his
pen
dipped
in
the
ink
what
was
it
to
him
he
remembered
that
she
lay
there
saying
always
i
am
the
landlady
put
his
supper
in
the
little
parlour
where
he
had
sat
in
the
morning
when
it
was
on
the
table
she
sat
down
in
the
as
her
fashion
was
to
knit
and
talk
that
she
might
gather
news
for
her
customers
in
the
taproom
in
the
white
face
under
the
queer
cap
she
saw
nothing
of
the
morning
s
traveller
the
newcomer
was
communicative
she
was
a
nurse
by
profession
she
said
had
come
to
the
transvaal
hearing
that
good
nurses
were
needed
there
she
had
not
yet
found
work
the
landlady
did
not
perhaps
know
whether
there
would
be
any
for
her
in
that
town
the
landlady
put
down
her
knitting
and
smote
her
fat
hands
together
if
it
wasn
t
the
very
finger
of
god
s
providence
as
though
you
saw
it
hanging
out
of
the
sky
she
said
here
was
a
lady
ill
and
needing
a
new
nurse
that
very
day
and
not
able
to
get
one
to
her
mind
and
now
well
if
it
wasn
t
enough
to
convert
all
the
atheists
and
freethinkers
in
the
transvaal
she
didn
t
know
then
the
landlady
proceeded
to
detail
facts
i
m
sure
you
will
suit
her
she
added
you
re
just
the
kind
she
has
heaps
of
money
to
pay
you
with
has
everything
that
money
can
buy
and
i
got
a
letter
with
a
check
in
it
for
fifty
pounds
the
other
day
from
some
one
who
says
i
m
to
spend
it
for
her
and
not
to
let
her
know
she
is
asleep
now
but
i
ll
take
you
in
to
look
at
the
landlady
opened
the
door
of
the
next
room
and
gregory
followed
her
a
table
stood
near
the
bed
and
a
lamp
burning
low
stood
on
it
the
bed
was
a
great
with
white
curtains
and
the
quilt
was
of
rich
crimson
satin
but
gregory
stood
just
inside
the
door
with
his
head
bent
low
and
saw
no
further
come
nearer
i
ll
turn
the
lamp
up
a
bit
that
you
can
have
a
look
at
her
a
pretty
thing
isn
t
it
said
the
landlady
near
the
foot
of
the
bed
was
a
dent
in
the
crimson
quilt
and
out
of
it
doss
small
head
and
bright
eyes
looked
knowingly
then
gregory
looked
up
at
what
lay
on
the
cushion
a
little
white
white
face
transparent
as
an
angel
s
with
a
cloth
bound
round
the
forehead
and
with
soft
hair
tossed
about
on
the
pillow
we
had
to
cut
it
off
said
the
woman
touching
it
with
her
forefinger
soft
as
silk
like
a
wax
doll
but
gregory
s
heart
was
bleeding
never
get
up
again
the
doctor
says
said
the
landlady
gregory
uttered
one
word
in
an
instant
the
beautiful
eyes
opened
widely
looked
round
the
room
and
into
the
dark
corners
who
is
here
whom
did
i
hear
speak
gregory
had
sunk
back
behind
the
curtain
the
landlady
drew
it
aside
and
pulled
him
forward
only
this
lady
ma
am
a
nurse
by
profession
she
is
willing
to
stay
and
take
care
of
you
if
you
can
come
to
terms
with
lyndall
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
and
cast
one
keen
scrutinizing
glance
over
him
have
i
never
seen
you
before
she
asked
she
fell
back
wearily
perhaps
you
would
like
to
arrange
the
terms
between
yourselves
said
the
landlady
here
is
a
chair
i
will
be
back
gregory
sat
down
with
bent
head
and
quick
breath
she
did
not
speak
and
lay
with
eyes
seeming
to
have
forgotten
him
will
you
turn
the
lamp
down
a
little
she
said
at
last
i
can
not
bear
the
then
his
heart
grew
braver
in
the
shadow
and
he
spoke
nursing
was
to
him
he
said
his
chosen
life
s
work
he
wanted
no
money
if
she
stopped
him
i
take
no
service
for
which
i
do
not
pay
she
said
what
i
gave
to
my
last
nurse
i
will
give
to
you
if
you
do
not
like
it
you
may
and
gregory
muttered
humbly
he
would
take
it
afterward
she
tried
to
turn
herself
he
lifted
her
ah
a
shrunken
little
body
he
could
feel
its
weakness
as
he
touched
it
his
hands
were
to
him
glorified
for
what
they
had
done
thank
you
that
is
so
nice
other
people
hurt
me
when
they
touch
me
she
said
thank
you
then
after
a
little
while
she
repeated
humbly
thank
you
they
hurt
me
gregory
sat
down
trembling
his
little
could
they
hurt
her
the
doctor
said
of
gregory
four
days
after
she
is
the
most
experienced
nurse
i
ever
came
in
contact
gregory
standing
in
the
passage
heard
it
and
laughed
in
his
heart
what
need
had
he
of
experience
experience
teaches
us
in
a
millennium
what
passion
teaches
us
in
an
hour
a
kaffer
studies
all
his
life
the
discerning
of
distant
sounds
but
he
will
never
hear
my
step
when
my
love
hears
it
coming
to
her
window
in
the
dark
over
the
short
grass
at
first
gregory
s
heart
was
sore
when
day
by
day
the
body
grew
lighter
and
the
mouth
he
fed
took
less
but
afterward
he
grew
accustomed
to
it
and
was
happy
for
passion
has
one
cry
one
only
oh
to
touch
thee
beloved
in
that
quiet
room
lyndall
lay
on
the
bed
with
the
dog
at
her
feet
and
gregory
sat
in
his
dark
corner
watching
she
seldom
slept
and
through
those
long
long
days
she
would
lie
watching
the
round
streak
of
sunlight
that
came
through
the
knot
in
the
shutter
or
the
massive
lion
s
paw
on
which
the
wardrobe
rested
what
thoughts
were
in
those
eyes
gregory
wondered
he
dared
not
ask
sometimes
doss
where
he
lay
on
her
feet
would
dream
that
they
two
were
in
the
cart
tearing
over
the
veld
with
the
black
horses
snorting
and
the
wind
in
their
faces
and
he
would
start
up
in
his
sleep
and
bark
aloud
then
awaking
he
would
lick
his
mistress
hand
almost
remorsefully
and
slink
quietly
down
into
his
place
gregory
thought
she
had
no
pain
she
never
groaned
only
sometimes
when
the
light
was
near
her
he
thought
he
could
see
contractions
about
her
lips
and
eyebrows
he
slept
on
the
sofa
outside
her
door
one
night
he
thought
he
heard
a
sound
and
opening
it
softly
he
looked
in
she
was
crying
out
aloud
as
if
she
and
her
pain
were
alone
in
the
world
the
light
fell
on
the
red
quilt
and
the
little
hands
that
were
clasped
over
the
head
the
eyes
were
looking
up
and
the
heavy
drops
fell
slowly
from
them
i
can
not
bear
any
more
not
any
more
she
said
in
a
deep
voice
oh
god
god
have
i
not
borne
in
silence
have
i
not
endured
these
long
long
months
but
now
now
oh
god
i
can
not
gregory
knelt
in
the
doorway
listening
i
do
not
ask
for
wisdom
not
human
love
not
work
not
knowledge
not
for
all
things
i
have
longed
for
she
cried
only
a
little
freedom
from
pain
only
one
little
hour
without
pain
then
i
will
suffer
she
sat
up
and
bit
the
little
hand
gregory
loved
he
crept
away
to
the
front
door
and
stood
looking
out
at
the
quiet
starlight
when
he
came
back
she
was
lying
in
her
usual
posture
the
quiet
eyes
looking
at
the
lion
s
claw
he
came
close
to
the
bed
you
have
much
pain
tonight
he
asked
her
no
not
can
i
do
anything
for
you
no
she
still
drew
her
lips
together
and
motioned
with
her
fingers
toward
the
dog
who
lay
sleeping
at
her
feet
gregory
lifted
him
and
laid
him
at
her
side
she
made
gregory
turn
open
the
bosom
of
her
nightdress
that
the
dog
might
put
his
black
muzzle
between
her
breasts
she
crossed
her
arms
over
him
gregory
left
them
lying
there
together
next
day
when
they
asked
her
how
she
was
she
answered
some
one
ought
to
tell
her
said
the
landlady
we
can
t
let
her
soul
go
out
into
eternity
not
knowing
especially
when
i
don
t
think
it
was
all
right
about
the
child
you
ought
to
go
and
tell
her
so
the
little
doctor
edged
on
and
on
went
in
at
last
when
he
came
out
of
the
room
he
shook
his
fist
in
the
landlady
s
face
the
next
time
you
have
any
devil
s
work
to
do
do
it
yourself
he
said
and
he
shook
his
fist
in
her
face
again
and
went
away
swearing
when
gregory
went
into
the
bedroom
he
only
found
her
moved
her
body
curled
up
and
drawn
close
to
the
wall
he
dared
not
disturb
her
at
last
after
a
long
time
she
turned
bring
me
food
she
said
i
want
to
eat
two
eggs
and
toast
and
meat
two
large
slices
of
toast
wondering
gregory
brought
a
tray
with
all
that
she
had
asked
for
sit
me
up
and
put
it
close
to
me
she
said
i
am
going
to
eat
it
she
tried
to
draw
the
things
near
her
with
her
fingers
and
the
plates
she
cut
the
toast
into
long
strips
broke
open
both
eggs
put
a
tiny
morsel
of
bread
into
her
own
mouth
and
fed
the
dog
with
pieces
of
meat
put
into
his
jaws
with
her
fingers
is
it
twelve
o
clock
yet
she
said
i
think
i
do
not
generally
eat
so
early
put
it
away
please
carefully
no
do
not
take
it
away
only
on
the
table
when
the
clock
strikes
twelve
i
will
eat
she
lay
down
trembling
after
a
little
while
she
said
give
me
my
he
looked
at
her
yes
i
am
going
to
dress
tomorrow
i
should
get
up
now
but
it
is
rather
late
put
them
on
that
chair
my
collars
are
in
the
little
box
my
boots
behind
the
her
eyes
followed
him
intently
as
he
collected
the
articles
one
by
one
and
placed
them
on
the
chair
as
she
directed
put
it
nearer
she
said
i
can
not
see
it
and
she
lay
watching
the
clothes
with
her
hand
under
her
cheek
now
open
the
shutter
wide
she
said
i
am
going
to
the
old
old
tone
was
again
in
the
sweet
voice
he
obeyed
her
and
opened
the
shutter
and
raised
her
up
among
the
pillows
now
bring
my
books
to
me
she
said
motioning
eagerly
with
her
fingers
the
large
book
and
the
reviews
and
the
plays
i
want
them
he
piled
them
round
her
on
the
bed
she
drew
them
greedily
closer
her
eyes
very
bright
but
her
face
as
white
as
a
mountain
lily
now
the
big
one
off
the
drawers
no
you
need
not
help
me
to
hold
my
book
she
said
i
can
hold
it
for
gregory
went
back
to
his
corner
and
for
a
little
time
the
restless
turning
over
of
leaves
was
to
be
heard
will
you
open
the
window
she
said
almost
querulously
and
throw
this
book
out
it
is
so
utterly
foolish
i
thought
it
was
a
valuable
book
but
the
words
are
merely
strung
together
they
make
no
sense
yes
so
she
said
with
approval
seeing
him
fling
it
out
into
the
street
i
must
have
been
very
foolish
when
i
thought
that
book
then
she
turned
to
read
and
leaned
her
little
elbows
resolutely
on
the
great
volume
and
knit
her
brows
this
was
shakespeare
it
must
mean
something
i
wish
you
would
take
a
handkerchief
and
tie
it
tight
round
my
head
it
aches
he
had
not
been
long
in
his
seat
when
he
saw
drops
fall
from
beneath
the
hands
that
shaded
the
eyes
on
to
the
page
i
am
not
accustomed
to
so
much
light
it
makes
my
head
swim
a
little
she
said
go
out
and
close
the
when
he
came
back
she
lay
shrivelled
up
among
the
pillows
he
heard
no
sound
of
weeping
but
the
shoulders
shook
he
darkened
the
room
completely
when
gregory
went
to
his
sofa
that
night
she
told
him
to
wake
her
early
she
would
be
dressed
before
breakfast
nevertheless
when
morning
came
she
said
it
was
a
little
cold
and
lay
all
day
watching
her
clothes
upon
the
chair
still
she
sent
for
her
oxen
in
the
country
they
would
start
on
monday
and
go
down
to
the
colony
in
the
afternoon
she
told
him
to
open
the
window
wide
and
draw
the
bed
near
it
it
was
a
leaden
afternoon
the
dull
rested
close
to
the
roofs
of
the
houses
and
the
little
street
was
silent
and
deserted
now
and
then
a
gust
of
wind
eddying
round
caught
up
the
dried
leaves
whirled
them
hither
and
thither
under
the
trees
and
dropped
them
again
into
the
gutter
then
all
was
quiet
she
lay
looking
out
presently
the
bell
of
the
church
began
to
toll
and
up
the
village
street
came
a
long
procession
they
were
carrying
an
old
man
to
his
last
she
followed
them
with
her
eyes
till
they
turned
in
among
the
trees
at
the
gate
who
was
that
she
asked
an
old
man
he
answered
a
very
old
man
they
say
he
was
but
his
name
i
do
not
she
mused
a
while
looking
out
with
fixed
eyes
that
is
why
the
bell
rang
so
cheerfully
she
said
when
the
old
die
it
is
well
they
have
had
their
time
it
is
when
the
young
die
that
the
bells
weep
drops
of
but
the
old
love
life
he
said
for
it
was
sweet
to
hear
her
speak
she
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
they
love
life
they
do
not
want
to
die
she
answered
but
what
of
that
they
have
had
their
time
they
knew
that
a
man
s
life
is
years
and
ten
they
should
have
made
their
plans
accordingly
but
the
young
she
said
the
young
cut
down
cruelly
when
they
have
not
seen
when
they
have
not
known
when
they
have
not
found
it
is
for
them
that
the
bells
weep
blood
i
heard
in
the
ringing
it
was
an
old
man
when
the
old
die
listen
to
the
bell
it
is
laughing
it
is
right
it
is
right
he
has
had
his
they
can
not
ring
so
for
the
she
fell
back
exhausted
the
hot
light
died
from
her
eyes
and
she
lay
looking
out
into
the
street
by
and
by
stragglers
from
the
funeral
began
to
come
back
and
disappear
here
and
there
among
the
houses
then
all
was
quiet
and
the
night
began
to
settle
down
upon
the
village
street
afterward
when
the
room
was
almost
dark
so
that
they
could
not
see
each
other
s
faces
she
said
it
will
rain
tonight
and
moved
restlessly
on
the
pillows
how
terrible
when
the
rain
falls
down
on
he
wondered
what
she
meant
and
they
sat
on
in
the
still
darkening
room
she
moved
again
will
you
presently
take
my
cloak
and
new
grey
cloak
from
behind
the
door
and
go
out
with
it
you
will
find
a
little
grave
at
the
foot
of
the
tall
the
water
drips
off
the
long
pointed
leaves
you
must
cover
it
up
with
she
moved
restlessly
as
though
in
pain
gregory
assented
and
there
was
silence
again
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
spoken
of
her
child
it
was
so
small
she
said
it
lived
such
a
little
while
only
three
hours
they
laid
it
close
by
me
but
i
never
saw
it
i
could
feel
it
by
she
waited
its
feet
were
so
cold
i
took
them
in
my
hand
to
make
them
warm
and
my
hand
closed
right
over
them
they
were
so
there
was
an
uneven
trembling
in
the
voice
it
crept
close
to
me
it
wanted
to
drink
it
wanted
to
be
she
hardened
herself
i
did
not
love
it
its
father
was
not
my
prince
i
did
not
care
for
it
but
it
was
so
she
moved
her
hand
they
might
have
kissed
it
one
of
them
before
they
put
it
in
it
never
did
any
one
any
harm
in
all
its
little
life
they
might
have
kissed
it
one
of
gregory
felt
that
some
one
was
sobbing
in
the
room
late
on
in
the
evening
when
the
shutter
was
closed
and
the
lamp
lighted
and
the
beat
on
the
roof
he
took
the
cloak
from
behind
the
door
and
went
away
with
it
on
his
way
back
he
called
at
the
village
and
brought
back
a
letter
in
the
hall
he
stood
reading
the
address
how
could
he
fail
to
know
whose
hand
had
written
it
had
he
not
long
ago
studied
those
characters
on
the
torn
fragments
of
paper
in
the
old
parlour
a
burning
pain
was
at
gregory
s
heart
if
now
now
at
the
last
one
should
come
should
step
in
between
he
carried
the
letter
into
the
bedroom
and
gave
it
to
her
bring
me
the
lamp
nearer
she
said
when
she
had
read
it
she
asked
for
her
desk
then
gregory
sat
down
in
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
curtain
and
heard
the
pencil
move
on
the
paper
when
he
looked
round
the
curtain
she
was
lying
on
the
pillow
musing
the
open
letter
lay
at
her
side
she
glanced
at
it
with
soft
eyes
the
man
with
the
languid
eyelids
must
have
been
strangely
moved
before
his
hand
set
down
those
words
let
me
come
back
to
you
my
darling
let
me
put
my
hand
round
you
and
guard
you
from
all
the
world
as
my
wife
they
shall
never
touch
you
i
have
learnt
to
love
you
more
wisely
more
tenderly
than
of
old
you
shall
have
perfect
freedom
lyndall
grand
little
woman
for
your
own
sake
be
my
wife
why
did
you
send
that
money
back
to
me
you
are
cruel
to
me
it
is
not
rightly
she
rolled
the
little
red
pencil
softly
between
her
fingers
and
her
face
grew
very
soft
yet
it
can
not
be
she
wrote
i
thank
you
much
for
the
love
you
have
shown
me
but
i
can
not
listen
you
will
call
me
mad
foolish
the
world
would
do
so
but
i
know
what
i
need
and
the
kind
of
path
i
must
walk
in
i
can
not
marry
you
i
will
always
love
you
for
the
sake
of
what
lay
by
me
those
three
hours
but
there
it
ends
i
must
know
and
see
i
can
not
be
bound
to
one
whom
i
love
as
i
love
you
i
am
not
afraid
of
the
world
i
will
fight
the
world
one
day
perhaps
it
may
be
far
off
i
shall
find
what
i
have
wanted
all
my
life
something
nobler
stronger
than
i
before
which
i
can
kneel
down
you
lose
nothing
by
not
having
me
now
i
am
a
weak
selfish
erring
woman
one
day
i
shall
find
something
to
worship
and
then
i
shall
be
nurse
she
said
take
my
desk
away
i
am
suddenly
so
sleepy
i
will
write
more
she
turned
her
face
to
the
pillow
it
was
the
sudden
drowsiness
of
great
weakness
she
had
dropped
asleep
in
a
moment
and
gregory
moved
the
desk
softly
and
then
sat
in
the
chair
watching
hour
after
hour
passed
but
he
had
no
wish
for
rest
and
sat
on
hearing
the
rain
cease
and
the
still
night
settle
down
everywhere
at
a
twelve
he
rose
and
took
a
last
look
at
the
bed
where
she
lay
sleeping
so
peacefully
then
he
turned
to
go
to
his
couch
before
he
had
reached
the
door
she
had
started
up
and
was
calling
him
back
you
are
sure
you
have
put
it
up
she
said
with
a
look
of
blank
terror
at
the
window
it
will
not
fall
open
in
the
night
the
shutter
you
are
sure
he
comforted
her
yes
it
was
tightly
fastened
even
if
it
is
shut
she
said
in
a
whisper
you
can
not
keep
it
out
you
feel
it
coming
in
at
four
o
clock
creeping
creeping
up
up
deadly
cold
she
shuddered
he
thought
she
was
wandering
and
laid
her
little
trembling
body
down
among
the
blankets
i
dreamed
just
now
that
it
was
not
put
up
she
said
looking
into
his
eyes
and
it
crept
right
in
and
i
was
alone
with
what
do
you
fear
he
asked
tenderly
the
grey
dawn
she
said
glancing
round
at
the
window
i
was
never
afraid
of
anything
never
when
i
was
a
little
child
but
i
have
always
been
afraid
of
that
you
will
not
let
it
come
in
to
me
no
no
i
will
stay
with
you
he
continued
but
she
was
growing
calmer
no
you
must
go
to
bed
i
only
awoke
with
a
start
you
must
be
tired
i
am
childish
that
is
all
but
she
shivered
again
he
sat
down
beside
her
after
some
time
she
said
will
you
not
rub
my
feet
he
knelt
down
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
took
the
tiny
foot
in
his
hand
it
was
swollen
and
unsightly
now
but
as
he
touched
it
he
bent
down
and
covered
it
with
kisses
it
makes
it
better
when
you
kiss
it
thank
you
what
makes
you
all
love
me
so
then
dreamily
she
muttered
to
herself
not
utterly
bad
not
quite
bad
what
makes
them
all
love
me
so
kneeling
there
rubbing
softly
with
his
cheek
pressed
against
the
little
foot
gregory
dropped
to
sleep
at
last
how
long
he
knelt
there
he
could
not
tell
but
when
he
started
up
awake
she
was
not
looking
at
him
the
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
far
corner
gazing
wide
and
intent
with
an
unearthly
light
he
looked
round
fearfully
what
did
she
see
there
god
s
angels
come
to
call
her
something
fearful
he
saw
only
the
purple
curtain
with
the
shadows
that
fell
from
it
softly
he
whispered
asking
what
she
saw
there
and
she
said
in
a
voice
strangely
unlike
her
own
i
see
the
vision
of
a
poor
weak
soul
striving
after
good
it
was
not
cut
short
and
in
the
end
it
learnt
through
tears
and
much
pain
that
holiness
is
an
infinite
compassion
for
others
that
greatness
is
to
take
the
common
things
of
life
and
walk
truly
among
them
that
she
moved
her
white
hand
and
laid
it
on
her
forehead
happiness
is
a
great
love
and
much
serving
it
was
not
cut
short
and
it
loved
what
it
had
learnt
it
loved
and
was
that
all
she
saw
in
the
corner
gregory
told
the
landlady
the
next
morning
that
she
had
been
wandering
all
night
yet
when
he
came
in
to
give
her
her
breakfast
she
was
sitting
up
against
the
pillows
looking
as
he
had
not
seen
her
look
before
put
it
close
to
me
she
said
and
when
i
have
had
breakfast
i
am
going
to
she
finished
all
he
had
brought
her
eagerly
i
am
sitting
up
quite
by
myself
she
said
give
me
his
meat
and
she
fed
the
dog
herself
cutting
his
food
small
for
him
she
moved
to
the
side
of
the
bed
now
bring
the
chair
near
and
dress
me
it
is
being
in
this
room
so
long
and
looking
at
that
miserable
little
bit
of
sunshine
that
comes
in
through
the
shutter
that
is
making
me
so
ill
always
that
lion
s
paw
she
said
with
a
look
of
disgust
at
it
come
and
dress
gregory
knelt
on
the
floor
before
her
and
tried
to
draw
on
one
stocking
but
the
little
swollen
foot
refused
to
be
covered
it
is
very
funny
that
i
should
have
grown
so
fat
since
i
have
been
so
ill
she
said
peering
down
curiously
perhaps
it
is
want
of
she
looked
troubled
and
said
again
perhaps
it
is
want
of
she
wanted
gregory
to
say
so
too
but
he
only
found
a
larger
pair
and
then
tried
to
force
the
shoes
oh
so
tenderly
on
to
her
little
feet
there
she
said
looking
down
at
them
when
they
were
on
with
the
delight
of
a
small
child
over
its
first
shoes
i
could
walk
far
now
how
nice
it
looks
no
she
said
seeing
the
soft
gown
he
had
prepared
for
her
i
will
not
put
that
on
get
one
of
my
white
dresses
the
one
with
the
pink
bows
i
do
not
even
want
to
think
i
have
been
ill
it
is
thinking
and
thinking
of
things
that
makes
them
real
she
said
when
you
draw
your
mind
together
and
resolve
that
a
thing
shall
not
be
it
gives
way
before
you
it
is
not
everything
is
possible
if
one
is
resolved
she
said
she
drew
in
her
little
lips
together
and
gregory
obeyed
her
she
was
so
small
and
slight
now
it
was
like
dressing
a
small
doll
he
would
have
lifted
her
down
from
the
bed
when
he
had
finished
but
she
pushed
him
from
her
laughing
very
softly
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
laughed
in
those
long
dreary
months
no
no
i
can
get
down
myself
she
said
slipping
cautiously
on
to
the
floor
you
see
she
cast
a
defiant
glance
of
triumph
when
she
stood
there
hold
the
curtain
up
high
i
want
to
look
at
he
raised
it
and
stood
holding
it
she
looked
into
the
glass
on
the
opposite
wall
such
a
queenly
little
figure
in
its
pink
and
white
such
a
transparent
little
face
refined
by
suffering
into
an
almost
beauty
the
face
looked
at
her
she
looked
back
laughing
softly
doss
quivering
with
excitement
ran
round
her
barking
she
took
one
step
toward
the
door
balancing
herself
with
outstretched
hands
i
am
nearly
there
she
said
then
she
groped
blindly
oh
i
can
not
see
i
can
not
see
where
am
i
she
cried
when
gregory
reached
her
she
had
fallen
with
her
face
against
the
sharp
foot
of
the
wardrobe
and
cut
her
forehead
very
tenderly
he
raised
the
little
crushed
heap
of
muslin
and
ribbons
and
laid
it
on
the
bed
doss
climbed
up
and
sat
looking
down
at
it
very
softly
gregory
s
hands
disrobed
her
you
will
be
stronger
tomorrow
and
then
we
shall
try
again
he
said
but
she
neither
looked
at
him
nor
stirred
when
he
had
undressed
her
and
laid
her
in
bed
doss
stretched
himself
across
her
feet
and
lay
whining
softly
so
she
lay
all
that
morning
and
all
that
afternoon
again
and
again
gregory
crept
close
to
the
bedside
and
looked
at
her
but
she
did
not
speak
to
him
was
it
stupor
or
was
it
sleep
that
shone
under
those
eyelids
gregory
could
not
tell
at
last
in
the
evening
he
bent
over
her
the
oxen
have
come
he
said
we
can
start
tomorrow
if
you
like
shall
i
get
the
wagon
ready
tonight
twice
he
repeated
his
question
then
she
looked
up
at
him
and
gregory
saw
that
all
hope
had
died
out
of
the
beautiful
eyes
it
was
not
stupor
that
shone
there
it
was
despair
yes
let
us
go
she
said
it
makes
no
difference
said
the
doctor
staying
or
going
it
is
close
so
the
next
day
gregory
carried
her
out
in
his
arms
to
the
wagon
which
stood
inspanned
before
the
door
as
he
laid
her
down
on
the
kartel
she
looked
far
out
across
the
plain
for
the
first
time
she
spoke
that
day
that
blue
mountain
far
away
let
us
stop
when
we
get
to
it
not
she
closed
her
eyes
again
he
drew
the
sails
down
before
and
behind
and
the
wagon
rolled
away
slowly
the
landlady
and
the
niggers
stood
to
watch
it
from
the
stoep
very
silently
the
great
wagon
rolled
along
the
plain
the
driver
on
the
front
box
did
not
clap
his
whip
or
call
to
his
oxen
and
gregory
sat
beside
him
with
folded
arms
behind
them
in
the
closed
wagon
she
lay
with
the
dog
at
her
feet
very
quiet
with
folded
hands
he
gregory
dared
not
be
in
there
like
hagar
when
she
laid
her
treasure
down
in
the
wilderness
he
sat
afar
off
for
hagar
said
let
me
not
see
the
death
of
the
evening
came
and
yet
the
blue
mountain
was
not
reached
and
all
the
next
day
they
rode
on
slowly
but
still
it
was
far
off
only
at
evening
they
reached
it
not
blue
now
but
low
and
brown
covered
with
long
waving
grasses
and
rough
stones
they
drew
the
wagon
up
close
to
its
foot
for
the
night
it
was
a
sheltered
warm
spot
when
the
dark
night
had
come
when
the
tired
oxen
were
tied
to
the
wheels
and
the
driver
and
leader
had
rolled
themselves
in
their
blankets
before
the
fire
and
gone
to
sleep
then
gregory
fastened
down
the
sails
of
the
wagon
securely
he
fixed
a
long
candle
near
the
head
of
the
bed
and
lay
down
himself
on
the
floor
of
the
wagon
near
the
back
he
leaned
his
head
against
the
kartel
and
listened
to
the
chewing
of
the
tired
oxen
and
to
the
crackling
of
the
fire
till
overpowered
by
weariness
he
fell
into
a
heavy
sleep
then
all
was
very
still
in
the
wagon
the
dog
slept
on
his
mistress
feet
and
only
two
mosquitoes
creeping
in
through
a
gap
in
the
front
sail
buzzed
drearily
round
the
night
was
grown
very
old
when
from
a
long
peaceful
sleep
lyndall
awoke
the
candle
burnt
at
her
head
the
dog
lay
on
her
feet
but
he
shivered
it
seemed
as
though
a
coldness
struck
up
to
him
from
his
she
lay
with
folded
hands
looking
upward
and
she
heard
the
oxen
chewing
and
she
saw
the
two
mosquitoes
buzzing
drearily
round
and
round
and
her
thoughts
her
thoughts
ran
far
back
into
the
past
through
these
months
of
anguish
a
mist
had
rested
on
her
mind
it
was
rolled
together
now
and
the
old
clear
intellect
awoke
from
its
long
torpor
it
looked
back
into
the
past
it
saw
the
present
there
was
no
future
now
the
old
strong
soul
gathered
itself
together
for
the
last
time
it
knew
where
it
stood
slowly
raising
herself
on
her
elbow
she
took
from
the
sail
a
glass
that
hung
pinned
there
her
fingers
were
stiff
and
cold
she
put
the
pillow
on
her
breast
and
stood
the
glass
against
it
then
the
white
face
on
the
pillow
looked
into
the
white
face
in
the
glass
they
had
looked
at
each
other
often
so
before
it
had
been
a
child
s
face
once
looking
out
above
its
blue
pinafore
it
had
been
a
woman
s
face
with
a
dim
shadow
in
the
eyes
and
a
something
which
had
said
we
are
not
afraid
you
and
i
we
are
together
we
will
fight
you
and
now
tonight
it
had
come
to
this
the
dying
eyes
on
the
pillow
looked
into
the
dying
eyes
in
the
glass
they
knew
that
their
hour
had
come
she
raised
one
hand
and
pressed
the
stiff
fingers
against
the
glass
they
were
growing
very
stiff
she
tried
to
speak
to
it
but
she
would
never
speak
again
only
the
wonderful
yearning
light
was
in
the
eyes
still
the
body
was
dead
now
but
the
soul
clear
and
unclouded
looked
forth
then
slowly
without
a
sound
the
beautiful
eyes
closed
the
dead
face
that
the
glass
reflected
was
a
thing
of
marvelous
beauty
and
tranquillity
the
grey
dawn
crept
in
over
it
and
saw
it
lying
there
had
she
found
what
she
sought
for
something
to
worship
had
she
ceased
from
being
who
shall
tell
us
there
is
a
veil
of
terrible
mist
over
the
face
of
the
hereafter
chapter
dreams
tell
me
what
a
soul
desires
and
i
will
tell
you
what
it
so
runs
the
phrase
tell
me
what
a
man
dreams
and
i
will
tell
you
what
he
that
also
has
its
truth
for
ever
from
the
earliest
childhood
to
the
latest
age
day
by
day
and
step
by
step
the
busy
waking
life
is
followed
and
reflected
by
the
life
of
dreams
waking
dreams
sleeping
dreams
weird
misty
and
distorted
as
the
inverted
image
of
a
mirage
or
a
figure
seen
through
the
mountain
mist
they
are
still
the
reflections
of
a
reality
on
the
night
when
gregory
told
his
story
waldo
sat
alone
before
the
fire
his
untasted
supper
before
him
he
was
weary
after
his
day
s
work
too
weary
to
eat
he
put
the
plate
down
on
the
floor
for
doss
who
licked
it
clean
and
then
went
back
to
his
corner
after
a
time
the
master
threw
himself
across
the
foot
of
the
bed
without
undressing
and
fell
asleep
there
he
slept
so
long
that
the
candle
burnt
itself
out
and
the
room
was
in
darkness
but
he
dreamed
a
lovely
dream
as
he
lay
there
in
his
dream
to
his
right
rose
high
mountains
their
tops
crowned
with
snow
their
sides
clothed
with
bush
and
bathed
in
the
sunshine
at
their
feet
was
the
sea
blue
and
breezy
bluer
than
any
earthly
sea
like
the
sea
he
had
dreamed
of
in
his
boyhood
in
the
narrow
forest
that
ran
between
the
mountains
and
the
sea
the
air
was
rich
that
the
scent
of
the
that
hung
from
dark
green
bushes
and
through
the
velvety
grass
little
streams
ran
purling
down
into
the
sea
he
sat
on
a
high
square
rock
among
the
bushes
and
lyndall
sat
by
him
and
sang
to
him
she
was
only
a
small
child
with
a
blue
pinafore
and
a
grave
grave
little
face
he
was
looking
up
at
the
mountains
then
suddenly
when
he
looked
round
she
was
gone
he
slipped
down
from
his
rock
and
went
to
look
for
her
but
he
found
only
her
little
footmarks
he
found
them
on
the
bright
green
grass
and
in
the
moist
sand
and
there
where
the
little
streams
ran
purling
down
into
the
sea
in
and
out
in
and
out
and
among
the
bushes
where
the
hung
he
went
looking
for
her
at
last
far
off
in
the
sunshine
he
saw
her
gathering
shells
upon
the
sand
she
was
not
a
child
now
but
a
woman
and
the
sun
shone
on
her
soft
brown
hair
and
in
her
white
dress
she
put
the
shells
she
gathered
she
was
stooping
but
when
she
heard
his
step
she
stood
up
holding
her
skirt
close
about
her
and
waited
for
his
coming
one
hand
she
put
in
his
and
together
they
walked
on
over
the
glittering
sand
and
pink
and
they
heard
the
leaves
talking
and
they
heard
the
waters
babbling
on
their
way
to
the
sea
and
they
heard
the
sea
singing
to
itself
singing
singing
at
last
they
came
to
a
place
where
was
a
long
reach
of
pure
white
sand
there
she
stood
still
and
dropped
on
to
the
sand
one
by
one
the
shells
that
she
had
gathered
then
she
looked
up
into
his
face
with
her
beautiful
eyes
she
said
nothing
but
she
lifted
one
hand
and
laid
it
softly
on
his
forehead
the
other
she
laid
on
his
heart
with
a
cry
of
suppressed
agony
waldo
sprung
from
the
bed
flung
open
the
upper
half
of
the
door
and
leaned
out
breathing
heavily
great
god
it
might
be
only
a
dream
but
the
pain
was
very
real
as
though
a
knife
ran
through
his
heart
as
though
some
treacherous
murderer
crept
on
him
in
the
dark
the
strong
man
drew
his
breath
like
a
frightened
woman
only
a
dream
but
the
pain
was
very
real
he
muttered
as
he
pressed
his
right
hand
upon
his
breast
then
he
folded
his
arms
on
the
door
and
stood
looking
out
into
the
starlight
the
dream
was
with
him
still
the
woman
who
was
his
friend
was
not
separated
from
him
by
years
only
that
very
night
he
had
seen
her
he
looked
up
into
the
night
sky
that
all
his
life
long
had
mingled
itself
with
his
existence
there
were
a
thousand
faces
that
he
loved
looking
down
at
him
a
thousand
stars
in
their
glory
in
crowns
and
circles
and
solitary
grandeur
to
the
man
they
were
not
less
dear
than
to
the
boy
they
had
been
not
less
mysterious
yet
he
looked
up
at
them
and
shuddered
at
last
turned
away
from
them
with
horror
such
countless
multitudes
stretching
out
far
into
space
and
yet
not
in
one
of
them
all
was
she
though
he
searched
through
them
all
to
the
furthest
faintest
point
of
light
nowhere
should
he
ever
say
she
is
here
tomorrow
s
sun
would
rise
and
gild
the
world
s
mountains
and
shine
into
its
thousand
valleys
it
would
set
and
the
stars
creep
out
again
year
after
year
century
after
century
the
old
changes
of
nature
would
go
on
day
and
night
summer
and
winter
and
harvest
but
in
none
of
them
all
would
she
have
part
he
shut
the
door
to
keep
out
their
hideous
shining
and
because
the
dark
was
intolerable
lit
a
candle
and
paced
the
little
room
faster
and
faster
yet
he
saw
before
him
the
long
ages
of
eternity
that
would
roll
on
on
on
and
never
bring
her
she
would
exist
no
more
a
dark
mist
filled
the
little
room
oh
little
hand
oh
little
voice
oh
little
form
he
cried
oh
little
soul
that
walked
with
mine
oh
little
soul
that
looked
so
fearlessly
down
into
the
depths
do
you
exist
no
more
for
ever
for
all
time
he
cried
more
bitterly
it
is
for
this
hour
this
that
men
blind
reason
and
crush
out
thought
for
this
hour
this
this
they
barter
truth
and
knowledge
take
any
lie
any
creed
so
it
does
not
whisper
to
them
of
the
dead
that
they
are
dead
oh
god
for
a
hereafter
pain
made
his
soul
weak
it
cried
for
the
old
faith
they
are
the
tears
that
fall
into
the
grave
that
cement
the
power
of
the
priest
for
the
cry
of
the
soul
that
loves
and
loses
is
this
only
this
bridge
over
death
blend
the
here
with
the
hereafter
cause
the
mortal
to
robe
himself
in
immortality
let
me
not
say
of
my
dead
that
it
is
dead
i
will
believe
all
else
bear
all
else
endure
all
else
muttering
to
himself
waldo
walked
with
bent
head
the
mist
in
his
eyes
to
the
soul
s
wild
cry
for
its
own
there
are
many
answers
he
began
to
think
of
them
was
not
there
one
of
them
all
from
which
he
might
suck
one
drop
of
comfort
you
shall
see
her
again
says
the
christian
the
true
bible
christian
yes
you
shall
see
her
again
and
i
saw
the
dead
great
and
small
stand
before
god
and
the
books
were
opened
and
the
dead
were
judged
from
those
things
which
were
written
in
the
books
and
whosoever
was
not
found
written
in
the
book
of
life
was
cast
into
the
lake
of
fire
which
is
the
second
yes
you
shall
see
her
again
she
died
so
with
her
knee
unbent
with
her
hand
unraised
with
a
prayer
unuttered
in
the
pride
of
her
intellect
and
the
strength
of
her
youth
she
loved
and
she
was
loved
but
she
said
no
prayer
to
god
she
cried
for
no
mercy
she
repented
of
no
sin
yes
you
shall
see
her
in
his
bitterness
waldo
laughed
low
ah
he
had
long
ceased
to
hearken
to
the
hellish
voice
but
yet
another
speaks
you
shall
see
her
again
said
the
christian
deep
into
whose
soul
modern
unbelief
and
thought
have
crept
though
he
knows
it
not
he
it
is
who
uses
his
bible
as
the
use
their
shells
sorting
out
gems
from
refuse
he
sets
his
pearls
after
his
own
fashion
and
he
sets
them
well
do
not
fear
he
says
hell
and
judgment
are
not
god
is
love
i
know
that
beyond
this
blue
sky
above
us
is
a
love
as
over
all
the
will
show
her
to
you
again
not
spirit
only
the
little
hands
the
little
feet
you
loved
you
shall
lie
down
and
kiss
them
if
you
will
christ
arose
and
did
eat
and
drink
so
shall
she
arise
the
dead
all
the
dead
raised
incorruptible
god
is
love
you
shall
see
her
it
is
a
heavenly
song
this
of
the
christian
a
man
might
dry
his
tears
to
listen
to
it
but
for
this
one
thing
waldo
muttered
to
himself
confusedly
the
thing
i
loved
was
a
woman
proud
and
young
it
had
a
mother
once
who
dying
kissed
her
little
baby
and
prayed
god
that
she
might
see
it
again
if
it
had
lived
the
loved
thing
would
itself
have
had
a
son
who
when
he
closed
the
weary
eyes
and
smoothed
the
wrinkled
forehead
of
his
mother
would
have
prayed
god
to
see
that
old
face
smile
again
in
the
hereafter
to
the
son
heaven
will
be
no
heaven
if
the
sweet
worn
face
is
not
in
one
of
the
choirs
he
will
look
for
it
through
the
phalanx
of
god
s
glorified
angels
and
the
youth
will
look
for
the
maid
and
the
mother
for
the
baby
and
whose
then
shall
she
be
at
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
ah
god
ah
god
a
beautiful
dream
he
cried
but
can
any
one
dream
it
not
sleeping
waldo
paced
on
moaning
in
agony
and
longing
he
heard
the
transcendentalist
s
high
answer
what
have
you
to
do
with
flesh
the
gross
and
miserable
garment
in
which
spirit
hides
itself
you
shall
see
her
again
but
the
hand
the
foot
the
forehead
you
loved
you
shall
see
no
more
the
loves
the
fears
the
frailties
that
are
born
with
the
flesh
with
the
flesh
they
shall
die
let
them
die
there
is
that
in
man
that
can
not
die
a
seed
a
germ
an
embryo
a
spiritual
essence
higher
than
she
was
on
earth
as
the
tree
is
higher
than
the
seed
the
man
than
the
embryo
so
shall
you
behold
her
changed
glorified
high
words
ringing
well
they
are
the
offering
of
jewels
to
the
hungry
of
gold
to
the
man
who
dies
for
bread
bread
is
corruptible
gold
is
incorruptible
bread
is
light
gold
is
heavy
bread
is
common
gold
is
rare
but
the
hungry
man
will
barter
all
your
mines
for
one
morsel
of
bread
around
god
s
throne
there
may
be
choirs
and
companies
of
angels
cherubim
and
seraphim
rising
tier
above
tier
but
not
for
one
of
them
all
does
the
soul
cry
aloud
only
perhaps
for
a
little
human
woman
full
of
sin
that
it
once
loved
change
is
death
change
is
death
he
cried
i
want
no
angel
only
she
no
holier
and
no
better
with
all
her
sins
upon
her
so
give
her
me
or
give
me
nothing
and
truly
does
not
the
heart
love
its
own
with
the
strongest
passion
for
their
very
frailties
heaven
might
keep
its
angels
if
men
were
but
left
to
men
change
is
death
he
cried
change
is
death
who
dares
to
say
the
body
never
dies
because
it
turns
again
to
grass
and
flowers
and
yet
they
dare
to
say
the
spirit
never
dies
because
in
space
some
strange
unearthly
being
may
have
sprung
up
upon
its
ruins
leave
me
leave
me
he
cried
in
frantic
bitterness
give
me
back
what
i
have
lost
or
give
me
for
the
soul
s
fierce
cry
for
immortality
is
this
only
this
return
to
me
after
death
the
thing
as
it
was
before
leave
me
in
the
hereafter
the
being
that
i
am
today
rob
me
of
the
thoughts
the
feelings
the
desires
that
are
my
life
and
you
have
left
nothing
to
take
your
immortality
is
annihilation
your
hereafter
is
a
lie
waldo
flung
open
the
door
and
walked
out
into
the
starlight
his
thoughts
ever
driving
him
on
as
he
paced
there
there
must
be
a
hereafter
because
man
longs
for
it
he
whispered
is
not
all
life
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
one
long
yearning
for
that
which
we
never
touch
there
must
be
a
hereafter
because
we
can
not
think
of
any
end
to
life
can
we
think
of
a
beginning
is
it
easier
to
say
i
was
not
than
to
say
i
shall
not
be
and
yet
where
were
we
ninety
years
ago
dreams
dreams
ah
all
dreams
and
lies
no
ground
he
went
back
into
the
cabin
and
walked
there
hour
after
hour
passed
and
he
was
dreaming
for
mark
you
men
will
dream
the
most
that
can
be
asked
of
them
is
but
that
the
dream
be
not
in
too
glaring
discord
with
the
thing
they
know
he
walked
with
bent
head
all
dies
all
dies
the
roses
are
red
with
the
matter
that
once
reddened
the
cheek
of
the
child
the
flowers
bloom
the
fairest
on
the
last
year
s
battleground
the
work
of
death
s
finger
cunningly
wreathed
over
is
at
the
heart
of
all
things
even
of
the
living
death
s
finger
is
everywhere
the
rocks
are
built
up
of
a
life
that
was
bodies
thoughts
and
loves
die
from
where
springs
that
whisper
to
the
tiny
soul
of
man
you
shall
not
ah
is
there
no
truth
of
which
this
dream
is
shadow
he
fell
into
perfect
silence
and
at
last
as
he
walked
there
with
his
bent
head
his
soul
passed
down
the
steps
of
contemplation
into
that
vast
land
where
there
is
always
peace
that
land
where
the
soul
gazing
long
loses
all
consciousness
of
its
little
self
and
almost
feels
its
hand
on
the
old
mystery
of
universal
unity
that
surrounds
it
no
death
no
death
he
muttered
there
is
that
which
never
dies
which
abides
it
is
but
the
individual
that
perishes
the
whole
remains
it
is
the
organism
that
vanishes
the
atoms
are
there
it
is
but
the
man
that
dies
the
universal
whole
of
which
he
is
part
reworks
him
into
its
inmost
self
ah
what
matter
that
man
s
day
be
short
that
the
sunrise
sees
him
and
the
sunset
sees
his
grave
that
of
which
he
is
but
the
breath
has
breathed
him
forth
and
drawn
him
back
again
that
abides
we
for
the
little
soul
that
cries
aloud
for
continued
personal
existence
for
itself
and
its
beloved
there
is
no
help
for
the
soul
which
knows
itself
no
more
as
a
unit
but
as
a
part
of
the
universal
unity
of
which
the
beloved
also
is
a
part
which
feels
within
itself
the
throb
of
the
universal
life
for
that
soul
there
is
no
death
let
us
die
beloved
you
and
i
that
we
may
pass
on
forever
through
the
universal
life
in
that
deep
world
of
contemplation
all
fierce
desires
die
out
and
peace
comes
he
waldo
as
he
walked
there
saw
no
more
the
world
that
was
about
him
cried
out
no
more
for
the
thing
that
he
had
lost
his
soul
rested
was
it
only
john
think
you
who
saw
the
heavens
open
the
dreamers
see
it
every
day
long
years
before
the
father
had
walked
in
the
little
cabin
and
seen
choirs
of
angels
and
a
prince
like
unto
men
but
clothed
in
immortality
the
son
s
knowledge
was
not
as
the
father
s
therefore
the
dream
was
but
the
sweetness
was
all
there
the
infinite
peace
that
men
find
not
in
the
little
cankered
kingdom
of
the
tangible
the
bars
of
the
real
are
set
close
about
us
we
can
not
open
our
wings
but
they
are
struck
against
them
and
drop
bleeding
but
when
we
glide
between
the
bars
into
the
great
unknown
beyond
we
may
sail
forever
in
the
glorious
blue
seeing
nothing
but
our
own
shadows
so
age
succeeds
age
and
dream
succeeds
dream
and
of
the
joy
of
the
dreamer
no
man
knoweth
but
he
who
dreameth
our
fathers
had
their
dream
we
have
ours
the
generation
that
follows
will
have
its
own
without
dreams
and
phantoms
man
can
not
exist
chapter
waldo
goes
out
to
sit
in
the
sunshine
it
had
been
a
princely
day
the
long
morning
had
melted
slowly
into
a
rich
afternoon
rains
had
covered
the
karoo
with
a
heavy
coat
of
green
that
hid
the
red
earth
everywhere
in
the
very
chinks
of
the
stone
walls
dark
green
leaves
hung
out
and
beauty
and
growth
had
crept
even
into
the
beds
of
the
sandy
furrows
and
lined
them
with
weeds
on
the
broken
sod
walls
of
the
old
pigsty
flourished
and
lifted
heir
transparent
leaves
waldo
was
at
work
in
the
again
he
was
making
a
kitchen
table
for
em
as
the
long
curls
gathered
in
heaps
before
his
plane
he
paused
for
an
instant
now
and
again
to
throw
one
down
to
a
small
naked
nigger
who
had
crept
from
its
mother
who
stood
churning
in
the
sunshine
and
had
crawled
into
the
from
time
to
time
the
little
animal
lifted
its
fat
hand
as
it
expected
a
fresh
shower
of
curls
till
doss
jealous
of
his
master
s
noticing
any
other
small
creature
but
himself
would
catch
the
curl
in
his
mouth
and
roll
the
little
kaffer
over
in
the
sawdust
much
to
that
small
animal
s
contentment
it
was
too
lazy
an
afternoon
to
be
really
so
doss
satisfied
himself
with
snapping
at
the
little
nigger
s
fingers
and
sitting
on
him
till
he
laughed
waldo
as
he
worked
glanced
down
at
them
now
and
then
and
smiled
but
he
never
looked
out
across
the
plain
he
was
conscious
without
looking
of
that
broad
green
earth
it
made
his
work
pleasant
to
him
near
the
shadow
at
the
gable
the
mother
of
the
little
nigger
stood
churning
slowly
she
raised
and
let
fall
the
stick
in
her
hands
murmuring
to
herself
a
sleepy
chant
such
as
her
people
love
it
sounded
like
the
humming
of
bees
a
different
life
showed
itself
in
the
front
of
the
house
where
tant
sannie
s
cart
stood
ready
inspanned
and
the
herself
sat
in
the
front
room
drinking
coffee
she
had
come
to
visit
her
stepdaughter
probably
for
the
last
time
as
she
now
weighed
two
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
and
was
not
easily
able
to
move
on
a
chair
sat
her
mild
young
husband
nursing
the
baby
a
child
you
take
it
and
get
into
the
cart
with
it
said
tant
sannie
what
do
you
want
here
listening
to
our
woman
s
talk
the
young
man
arose
and
meekly
went
out
with
the
baby
i
m
very
glad
you
are
going
to
be
married
my
child
said
tant
sannie
as
she
drained
the
last
drop
from
her
coffee
cup
i
wouldn
t
say
so
while
that
boy
was
here
it
would
make
him
too
conceited
but
marriage
is
the
finest
thing
in
the
world
i
ve
been
at
it
three
times
and
if
it
pleased
god
to
take
this
husband
from
me
i
should
have
another
there
s
nothing
like
it
my
child
perhaps
it
might
not
suit
all
people
at
all
times
as
well
as
it
suits
you
tant
sannie
said
em
there
was
a
little
shade
of
weariness
in
the
voice
not
suit
every
one
said
tant
sannie
if
the
beloved
redeemer
didn
t
mean
men
to
have
wives
what
did
he
make
women
for
that
s
what
i
say
if
a
woman
s
old
enough
to
marry
and
doesn
t
she
s
sinning
against
the
lord
it
s
a
wanting
to
know
better
than
him
what
does
she
think
the
lord
took
all
that
trouble
in
making
her
for
nothing
it
s
evident
he
wants
babies
otherwise
why
does
he
send
them
not
that
i
ve
done
much
in
that
way
myself
said
tant
sannie
sorrowfully
but
i
ve
done
my
she
rose
with
some
difficulty
from
her
chair
and
began
moving
slowly
toward
the
door
it
s
a
strange
thing
she
said
but
you
can
t
love
a
man
till
you
ve
had
a
baby
by
him
now
there
s
that
boy
there
when
we
were
first
married
if
he
only
sneezed
in
the
night
i
boxed
his
ears
now
if
he
lets
his
come
on
my
i
don
t
think
of
laying
a
finger
on
him
there
s
nothing
like
being
married
said
tant
sannie
as
she
puffed
toward
the
door
if
a
woman
s
got
a
baby
and
a
husband
she
s
got
the
best
things
the
lord
can
give
her
if
only
the
baby
doesn
t
have
convulsions
as
for
a
husband
it
s
very
much
the
same
who
one
has
some
men
are
fat
and
some
men
are
thin
some
men
drink
brandy
and
some
men
drink
gin
but
it
all
comes
to
the
same
thing
in
the
end
it
s
all
one
a
man
s
a
man
you
here
they
came
upon
gregory
who
was
sitting
in
the
shade
before
the
house
tant
sannie
shook
hands
with
him
i
m
glad
you
re
going
to
get
married
she
said
i
hope
you
ll
have
as
many
children
in
five
years
as
a
cow
has
calves
and
more
too
i
think
i
ll
just
go
and
have
a
look
at
your
before
i
start
she
said
turning
to
em
not
that
i
believe
in
this
new
plan
of
putting
soda
in
the
pot
if
the
dear
father
had
meant
soda
to
be
put
into
soap
what
would
he
have
made
for
and
stuck
them
all
over
the
veld
as
thick
as
lambs
in
the
lambing
season
she
waddled
off
after
em
in
the
direction
of
the
leaving
gregory
as
they
found
him
with
his
dead
pipe
lying
on
the
bench
beside
him
and
his
blue
eyes
gazing
out
far
across
the
flat
like
one
who
sits
on
the
seashore
watching
that
which
is
fading
fading
from
him
against
his
breast
was
a
letter
found
in
the
desk
addressed
to
himself
but
never
posted
it
held
only
four
words
you
must
marry
he
wore
it
in
a
black
bag
round
his
neck
it
was
the
only
letter
she
had
ever
written
to
him
you
see
if
the
sheep
don
t
have
the
scab
this
year
said
tant
sannie
as
she
waddled
after
em
it
s
with
all
these
new
inventions
that
the
wrath
of
god
must
fall
on
us
what
were
the
children
of
israel
punished
for
if
it
wasn
t
for
making
a
golden
calf
i
may
have
my
sins
but
i
do
remember
the
tenth
commandment
honour
thy
father
and
mother
that
it
may
be
well
with
thee
and
that
thou
mayest
live
long
in
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
it
s
all
very
well
to
say
we
honour
them
and
then
to
be
finding
out
things
that
they
never
knew
and
doing
things
in
a
way
that
they
never
did
them
my
mother
boiled
soap
with
bushes
and
i
will
boil
soap
with
bushes
if
the
wrath
of
god
is
to
fall
upon
this
land
said
tant
sannie
with
the
serenity
of
conscious
virtue
it
shall
not
be
through
let
them
make
their
and
their
let
them
go
on
as
though
the
dear
lord
didn
t
know
what
he
was
about
when
he
gave
horses
and
oxen
legs
the
destruction
of
the
lord
will
follow
them
i
don
t
know
how
such
people
read
their
bibles
when
do
we
hear
of
moses
or
noah
riding
in
a
railway
the
lord
sent
out
of
heaven
in
those
days
there
s
no
chance
of
his
sending
them
for
us
if
we
go
on
in
this
way
said
tant
sannie
sorrowfully
thinking
of
the
splendid
chance
which
this
generation
had
lost
arrived
at
the
she
looked
over
into
it
thoughtfully
depend
upon
it
you
ll
get
the
itch
or
some
other
disease
the
blessing
of
the
lord
ll
never
rest
upon
it
said
the
then
suddenly
she
broke
forth
and
she
and
goats
and
rams
and
eight
thousand
morgen
and
the
rams
real
angora
and
two
thousand
sheep
and
a
bull
said
tant
sannie
standing
upright
and
planting
a
hand
on
each
hip
em
looked
at
her
in
silent
wonder
had
connubial
bliss
and
the
joys
of
motherhood
really
turned
the
old
s
head
yes
said
tant
sannie
i
had
almost
forgotten
to
tell
you
by
the
lord
if
i
had
him
here
we
were
walking
to
church
last
sacrament
sunday
piet
and
i
close
in
front
of
us
with
old
tant
trana
with
dropsy
and
cancer
and
can
t
live
eight
months
walking
by
her
was
something
with
its
hands
under
its
flap
flap
flap
and
its
chin
in
the
air
and
a
collar
and
the
black
hat
on
the
very
back
of
the
head
i
knew
him
who
s
that
i
asked
the
rich
englishman
that
tant
trana

last
rich
englishman
i
ll
rich
englishman
him
i
said
i
ll
tell
tant
trana
a
thing
or
two
my
fingers
were
just
in
his
little
white
curls
if
it
hadn
t
been
the
blessed
sacrament
he
wouldn
t
have
walked
so
sourka
sourka
sourka
any
more
but
i
thought
wait
till
i
ve
had
it
and
then
but
he
sly
fox
son
of
satan
seed
of
the
amalekite
he
saw
me
looking
at
him
in
the
church
the
blessed
sacrament
wasn
t
half
over
when
he
takes
tant
trana
by
the
arm
and
out
they
go
i
clap
my
baby
down
to
its
father
and
i
go
after
them
but
said
tant
sannie
regretfully
i
couldn
t
get
up
to
them
i
am
too
fat
when
i
got
to
the
corner
he
was
pulling
tant
trana
up
into
the
cart
tant
trana
i
said
you
ve
married
a
kaffer
s
dog
a
hottentot
s
i
hadn
t
any
more
breath
he
winked
at
me
he
winked
at
me
said
tant
sannie
her
sides
shaking
with
indignation
first
with
one
eye
and
then
with
the
other
and
then
drove
away
child
of
the
amalekite
said
tant
sannie
if
it
hadn
t
been
the
blessed
sacrament
lord
lord
lord
here
the
little
came
running
to
say
that
the
horses
would
stand
no
longer
and
still
breathing
out
vengeance
against
her
old
adversary
she
laboured
toward
the
cart
shaking
hands
and
affectionately
kissing
em
she
was
with
some
difficulty
drawn
up
then
slowly
the
cart
rolled
away
the
good
putting
her
head
out
between
the
sails
to
smile
and
nod
em
stood
watching
it
for
a
time
then
as
the
sun
dazzled
her
eyes
she
turned
away
there
was
no
use
in
going
to
sit
with
gregory
he
liked
best
sitting
there
alone
staring
across
the
the
green
karoo
and
till
the
maid
had
done
churning
there
was
nothing
to
do
so
em
walked
away
to
the
and
climbed
on
to
the
end
of
waldo
s
table
and
sat
there
swinging
one
little
foot
slowly
to
and
fro
while
the
wooden
curls
from
the
plane
heaped
themselves
up
against
her
black
print
dress
waldo
she
said
at
last
gregory
has
given
me
the
money
he
got
for
the
wagon
and
oxen
and
i
have
fifty
pounds
besides
that
once
belonged
to
some
one
i
know
what
they
would
have
liked
to
have
done
with
it
you
must
take
it
and
go
to
some
place
and
study
for
a
year
or
no
little
one
i
will
not
take
it
he
said
as
he
planed
slowly
away
the
time
was
when
i
would
have
been
very
grateful
to
any
one
who
would
have
given
me
a
little
money
a
little
help
a
little
power
of
gaining
knowledge
but
now
i
have
gone
so
far
alone
i
may
go
on
to
the
end
i
don
t
want
it
little
she
did
not
seem
pained
at
his
refusal
but
swung
her
foot
to
and
fro
the
little
old
wrinkled
forehead
more
wrinkled
up
than
ever
why
is
it
always
so
waldo
always
so
she
said
we
long
for
things
and
long
for
them
and
pray
for
them
we
would
give
all
we
have
to
come
near
to
them
but
we
never
reach
them
then
at
last
too
late
just
when
we
don
t
want
them
any
more
when
all
the
sweetness
is
taken
out
of
them
then
they
come
we
don
t
want
them
then
she
said
folding
their
hands
resignedly
on
her
little
apron
after
a
while
she
added
i
remember
once
very
long
ago
when
i
was
a
very
little
girl
my
mother
had
a
workbox
full
of
coloured
reels
i
always
wanted
to
play
with
them
but
she
would
never
let
me
at
last
one
day
she
said
i
might
take
the
box
i
was
so
glad
i
hardly
knew
what
to
do
i
ran
round
the
house
and
sat
down
with
it
on
the
back
steps
but
when
i
opened
the
box
all
the
cottons
were
taken
she
sat
for
a
while
longer
till
the
kaffer
maid
had
finished
churning
and
was
carrying
the
butter
toward
the
house
then
em
prepared
to
slip
off
the
table
but
first
she
laid
her
little
hand
on
waldo
s
he
stopped
his
planing
and
looked
up
gregory
is
going
to
the
town
tomorrow
he
is
going
to
give
in
our
bans
to
the
minister
we
are
going
to
be
married
in
three
waldo
lifted
her
very
gently
from
the
table
he
did
not
congratulate
her
perhaps
he
thought
of
the
empty
box
but
he
kissed
her
forehead
gravely
she
walked
away
toward
the
house
but
stopped
when
she
got
i
will
bring
you
a
glass
of
buttermilk
when
it
is
cool
she
called
out
and
soon
her
clear
voice
came
ringing
out
through
the
back
windows
as
she
sang
the
blue
water
to
herself
and
washed
the
butter
waldo
did
not
wait
till
she
returned
perhaps
he
had
at
last
really
grown
weary
of
work
perhaps
he
felt
the
chilly
for
he
had
shuddered
two
or
three
times
though
this
was
hardly
likely
in
that
warm
summer
weather
or
perhaps
and
most
probably
one
of
his
old
dreaming
fits
had
come
upon
him
suddenly
he
put
his
tools
together
ready
for
tomorrow
and
walked
slowly
out
at
the
side
of
the
there
was
a
world
of
bright
sunshine
and
a
hen
with
her
chickens
was
scratching
among
the
gravel
waldo
seated
himself
near
them
with
his
back
against
the
wall
the
long
afternoon
was
half
spent
and
the
kopje
was
just
beginning
to
cast
its
shadow
over
the
yellow
flowers
that
grew
between
it
and
the
farmhouse
among
the
flowers
the
white
butterflies
hovered
and
on
the
old
kraal
mounds
three
white
kids
gambolled
and
at
the
door
of
one
of
the
huts
an
old
sat
on
the
ground
mending
her
mats
a
balmy
restful
peacefulness
seemed
to
reign
everywhere
even
the
old
hen
seemed
well
satisfied
she
scratched
among
the
stones
and
called
to
her
chickens
when
she
found
a
treasure
and
all
the
while
tucked
to
herself
with
intense
inward
satisfaction
waldo
as
he
sat
with
his
knees
drawn
up
to
his
chin
and
his
arms
folded
on
them
looked
at
it
all
and
smiled
an
evil
world
a
deceitful
treacherous
world
it
might
be
but
a
lovely
world
for
all
that
and
to
sit
there
gloating
in
the
sunlight
was
perfect
it
was
worth
having
been
a
little
child
and
having
cried
and
prayed
so
one
might
sit
there
he
moved
his
hands
as
though
he
were
washing
them
in
the
sunshine
there
will
always
be
something
worth
living
for
while
there
are
shimmery
afternoons
waldo
chuckled
with
intense
inward
satisfaction
as
the
old
hen
had
done
she
over
the
insects
and
the
warmth
he
over
the
old
brick
walls
and
the
haze
and
the
little
bushes
beauty
is
god
s
wine
with
which
he
recompenses
the
souls
that
love
him
he
makes
them
drunk
the
fellow
looked
and
at
last
stretched
out
one
hand
to
a
little
that
grew
on
the
sod
wall
of
the
sty
not
as
though
he
would
have
picked
it
but
as
it
were
in
a
friendly
greeting
he
loved
it
one
little
leaf
of
the
stood
upright
and
the
sun
shone
through
it
he
could
see
every
little
crystal
cell
like
a
drop
of
ice
in
the
transparent
green
and
it
thrilled
him
there
are
only
rare
times
when
a
man
s
soul
can
see
nature
so
long
as
any
passion
holds
its
revel
there
the
eyes
are
holden
that
they
should
not
see
her
go
out
if
you
will
and
walk
alone
on
the
hillside
in
the
evening
but
if
your
favourite
child
lies
ill
at
home
or
your
lover
comes
tomorrow
or
at
your
heart
there
lies
a
scheme
for
the
holding
of
wealth
then
you
will
return
as
you
went
out
you
will
have
seen
nothing
for
nature
ever
like
the
old
hebrew
god
cries
out
thou
shalt
have
no
other
gods
before
only
then
when
there
comes
a
pause
a
blank
in
your
life
when
the
old
idol
is
broken
when
the
old
hope
is
dead
when
the
old
desire
is
crushed
then
the
divine
compensation
of
nature
is
made
manifest
she
shows
herself
to
you
so
near
she
draws
you
that
the
blood
seems
to
flow
from
her
to
you
through
a
still
uncut
cord
you
feel
the
throb
of
her
life
when
that
day
comes
that
you
sit
down
broken
without
one
human
creature
to
whom
you
cling
with
your
loves
the
dead
and
the
when
the
very
thirst
for
knowledge
through
thwarting
has
grown
dull
when
in
the
present
there
is
no
craving
and
in
the
future
no
hope
then
oh
with
a
beneficent
tenderness
nature
infolds
you
then
the
large
white
as
they
flutter
down
softly
one
by
one
whisper
soothingly
rest
poor
heart
rest
it
is
as
though
our
mother
smoothed
our
hair
and
we
are
comforted
and
bees
as
they
hum
make
a
dreamy
lyric
and
the
light
on
the
brown
stone
wall
is
a
great
work
of
art
and
the
glitter
through
the
leaves
makes
the
pulses
beat
well
to
die
then
for
if
you
live
so
surely
as
the
years
come
so
surely
as
the
spring
succeeds
the
winter
so
surely
will
passions
arise
they
will
creep
back
one
by
one
into
the
bosom
that
has
cast
them
forth
and
fasten
there
again
and
peace
will
go
desire
ambition
and
the
fierce
agonizing
flood
of
love
for
the
living
they
will
spring
again
then
nature
will
draw
down
her
veil
with
all
your
longing
you
shall
not
be
able
to
raise
one
corner
you
can
not
bring
back
those
peaceful
days
well
to
die
then
sitting
there
with
his
arms
folded
on
his
knees
and
his
hat
slouched
down
over
his
face
waldo
looked
out
into
the
yellow
sunshine
that
tinted
even
the
very
air
with
the
colour
of
ripe
corn
and
was
happy
he
was
an
uncouth
creature
with
small
learning
and
no
prospect
in
the
future
but
that
of
making
endless
tables
and
stone
walls
yet
it
seemed
to
him
as
he
sat
there
that
life
was
a
rare
and
very
rich
thing
he
rubbed
his
hands
in
the
sunshine
ah
to
live
on
so
year
after
year
how
well
always
in
the
present
letting
each
day
glide
bringing
its
own
labour
and
its
own
beauty
the
gradual
lighting
up
of
the
hills
night
and
the
stars
firelight
and
the
coals
to
live
on
so
calmly
far
from
the
paths
of
men
and
to
look
at
the
lives
of
clouds
and
insects
to
look
deep
into
the
heart
of
flowers
and
see
how
lovingly
the
pistil
and
the
stamens
nestle
there
together
and
to
see
in
the
how
the
little
seeds
suck
their
life
through
the
delicate
string
and
how
the
little
embryo
sleeps
inside
well
how
well
to
sit
so
on
one
side
taking
no
part
in
the
world
s
life
but
when
great
men
blossom
into
books
looking
into
those
flowers
also
to
see
how
the
world
of
men
too
opens
beautifully
leaf
after
leaf
ah
life
is
delicious
well
to
live
long
and
see
the
darkness
breaking
and
the
day
coming
the
day
when
soul
shall
not
thrust
back
soul
that
would
come
to
it
when
men
shall
not
be
driven
to
seek
solitude
because
of
the
of
their
hearts
for
love
and
sympathy
well
to
live
long
and
see
the
new
time
breaking
well
to
live
long
life
is
sweet
sweet
sweet
in
his
breast
pocket
where
of
old
the
broken
slate
used
to
be
there
was
now
a
little
dancing
shoe
of
his
friend
who
was
sleeping
he
could
feel
it
when
he
folded
his
arm
tight
against
his
breast
and
that
was
well
also
he
drew
his
hat
lower
over
his
eyes
and
sat
so
motionless
that
the
chickens
thought
he
was
asleep
and
gathered
closer
around
him
one
even
ventured
to
peck
at
his
boot
but
he
ran
away
quickly
tiny
yellow
fellow
that
he
was
he
knew
that
men
were
dangerous
even
sleeping
they
might
awake
but
waldo
did
not
sleep
and
coming
back
from
his
sunshiny
dream
stretched
out
his
hand
for
the
tiny
thing
to
mount
but
the
chicken
eyed
the
hand
and
then
ran
off
to
hide
under
its
mother
s
wing
and
from
beneath
it
it
sometimes
put
out
its
round
head
to
peep
at
the
great
figure
sitting
there
presently
its
brothers
ran
off
after
a
little
white
moth
and
it
ran
out
to
join
them
and
when
the
moth
fluttered
away
over
their
heads
they
stood
looking
up
disappointed
and
then
ran
back
to
their
mother
waldo
through
his
eyes
looked
at
them
thinking
fearing
craving
those
tiny
sparks
of
brother
life
what
were
they
so
real
there
in
that
old
yard
on
that
sunshiny
afternoon
a
few
years
where
would
they
be
strange
little
brother
spirits
he
stretched
his
hand
toward
them
for
his
heart
went
out
to
them
but
not
one
of
the
little
creatures
came
nearer
him
and
he
watched
them
gravely
for
a
time
then
he
smiled
and
began
muttering
to
himself
after
his
old
fashion
afterward
he
folded
his
arms
upon
his
knees
and
rested
his
forehead
on
them
and
so
he
sat
there
in
the
yellow
sunshine
muttering
muttering
muttering
to
himself
it
was
not
very
long
after
when
em
came
out
at
the
back
door
with
a
towel
thrown
across
her
head
and
in
her
hand
a
cup
of
milk
ah
she
said
coming
close
to
him
he
is
sleeping
now
he
will
find
it
when
he
wakes
and
be
glad
of
she
put
it
down
upon
the
ground
beside
him
the
was
at
work
still
among
the
stones
but
the
chickens
had
climbed
about
him
and
were
perching
on
him
one
stood
upon
his
shoulder
and
rubbed
its
little
head
softly
against
his
black
curls
another
tried
to
balance
itself
on
the
very
edge
of
the
old
felt
hat
one
tiny
fellow
stood
upon
his
hand
and
tried
to
crow
another
had
nestled
itself
down
comfortably
on
the
old
and
gone
to
sleep
there
em
did
not
drive
them
away
but
she
covered
the
glass
softly
at
his
side
he
will
wake
soon
she
said
and
be
glad
of
but
the
chickens
were
wiser
