the

of
a

the
case
of
george
dedlow
introduction
both
of
the
tales
in
this
little
volume
appeared
originally
in
the
atlantic
monthly
as
anonymous
contributions
i
owe
to
the
present
owners
of
that
journal
permission
to
use
them
the
autobiography
of
a
quack
has
been
recast
with
large
additions
the
case
of
george
dedlow
was
not
written
with
any
intention
that
it
should
appear
in
print
i
lent
the
manuscript
to
the
rev
furness
and
forgot
it
this
gentleman
sent
it
to
the
rev
edward
everett
hale
he
presuming
i
fancy
that
every
one
desired
to
appear
in
the
atlantic
offered
it
to
that
journal
to
my
surprise
soon
afterwards
i
received
a
proof
and
a
check
the
story
was
inserted
as
a
leading
article
without
my
name
it
was
at
once
accepted
by
many
as
the
description
of
a
real
case
money
was
collected
in
several
places
to
assist
the
unfortunate
man
and
benevolent
persons
went
to
the
stump
hospital
in
philadelphia
to
see
the
sufferer
and
to
offer
him
aid
the
spiritual
incident
at
the
end
of
the
story
was
received
with
joy
by
the
spiritualists
as
a
valuable
proof
of
the
truth
of
their
beliefs
weir

the
autobiography
of
a
quack
at
this
present
moment
of
time
i
am
what
the
doctors
call
an
interesting
case
and
am
to
be
found
in
bed
no
ward
massachusetts
general
hospital
i
am
told
that
i
have
what
is
called
addison
s
disease
and
that
it
is
this
pleasing
malady
which
causes
me
to
be
covered
with
large
blotches
of
a
dark
mulatto
tint
however
it
is
a
rather
grim
subject
to
joke
about
because
if
i
believed
the
doctor
who
comes
around
every
day
and
thumps
me
and
listens
to
my
chest
with
as
much
pleasure
as
if
i
were
music
all
through
i
say
if
i
really
believed
him
i
should
suppose
i
was
going
to
die
the
fact
is
i
don
t
believe
him
at
all
some
of
these
days
i
shall
take
a
turn
and
get
about
again
but
meanwhile
it
is
rather
dull
for
a
stirring
active
person
like
me
to
have
to
lie
still
and
watch
myself
getting
big
brown
and
yellow
spots
all
over
me
like
a
map
that
has
taken
to
growing
the
man
on
my
right
has
consumption
smells
of
oil
and
coughs
all
night
the
man
on
my
left
is
a
with
a
liver
which
has
struck
work
looks
like
a
human
pumpkin
and
how
he
contrives
to
whittle
jackstraws
all
day
and
eat
as
he
does
i
can
t
understand
i
have
tried
reading
and
tried
whittling
but
they
don
t
either
of
them
satisfy
me
so
that
yesterday
i
concluded
to
ask
the
doctor
if
he
couldn
t
suggest
some
other
amusement
i
waited
until
he
had
gone
through
the
ward
and
then
seized
my
chance
and
asked
him
to
stop
a
moment
well
my
man
said
he
what
do
you
want
i
thought
him
rather
disrespectful
but
i
replied
something
to
do
he
thought
a
little
and
then
said
i
ll
tell
you
what
to
do
i
think
if
you
were
to
write
out
a
plain
account
of
your
life
it
would
be
pretty
well
worth
reading
if
half
of
what
you
told
me
last
week
be
true
you
must
be
about
as
clever
a
scamp
as
there
is
to
be
met
with
i
suppose
you
would
just
as
lief
put
it
on
paper
as
talk
pretty
nearly
said
i
i
think
i
will
try
it
after
he
left
i
lay
awhile
thinking
over
the
matter
i
knew
well
that
i
was
what
the
world
calls
a
scamp
and
i
knew
also
that
i
had
got
little
good
out
of
the
fact
if
a
man
is
what
people
call
virtuous
and
fails
in
life
he
gets
credit
at
least
for
the
virtue
but
when
a
man
is
a
is
well
one
of
liberal
views
and
breaks
down
somehow
or
other
people
don
t
credit
him
with
even
the
intelligence
he
has
put
into
the
business
this
i
call
hard
if
i
did
not
recall
with
satisfaction
the
energy
and
skill
with
which
i
did
my
work
i
should
be
nothing
but
disgusted
at
the
melancholy
spectacle
of
my
failure
i
suppose
that
i
shall
at
least
find
occupation
in
reviewing
all
this
and
i
think
therefore
for
my
own
satisfaction
i
shall
try
to
amuse
my
convalescence
by
writing
a
plain
straightforward
account
of
the
life
i
have
led
and
the
various
devices
by
which
i
have
sought
to
get
my
share
of
the
money
of
my
countrymen
it
does
appear
to
me
that
i
have
had
no
end
of
bad
luck
as
no
one
will
ever
see
these
pages
i
find
it
pleasant
to
recall
for
my
own
satisfaction
the
fact
that
i
am
really
a
very
remarkable
man
i
am
or
rather
i
was
very
five
feet
eleven
with
a
lot
of
curly
red
hair
and
blue
eyes
i
am
which
is
another
unusual
thing
my
hands
have
often
been
noticed
i
get
them
from
my
mother
who
was
a
fishbourne
and
a
lady
as
for
my
father
he
was
rather
common
he
was
a
little
man
red
and
round
like
an
apple
but
very
strong
for
a
reason
i
shall
come
to
presently
the
family
must
have
had
a
pious
liking
for
bible
names
because
he
was
called
zebulon
my
sister
peninnah
and
i
ezra
which
is
not
a
name
for
a
gentleman
at
one
time
i
thought
of
changing
it
but
i
got
over
it
by
signing
myself
e
where
my
father
was
born
i
do
not
know
except
that
it
was
somewhere
in
new
jersey
for
i
remember
that
he
was
once
angry
because
a
man
called
him
a
jersey
spaniard
i
am
not
much
concerned
to
write
about
my
people
because
i
soon
got
above
their
level
and
as
to
my
mother
she
died
when
i
was
an
infant
i
get
my
manners
which
are
rather
remarkable
from
her
my
aunt
rachel
sanderaft
who
kept
house
for
us
was
a
queer
character
she
had
a
snug
little
property
about
seven
thousand
dollars
an
old
aunt
left
her
the
money
because
she
was
as
this
defect
came
upon
her
after
she
grew
up
she
still
kept
her
voice
this
woman
was
the
cause
of
some
of
my
ill
luck
in
life
and
i
hope
she
is
uncomfortable
wherever
she
is
i
think
with
satisfaction
that
i
helped
to
make
her
life
uneasy
when
i
was
young
and
worse
later
on
she
gave
away
to
the
idle
poor
some
of
her
small
income
and
hid
the
rest
like
a
magpie
in
her
bible
or
rolled
in
her
stockings
or
in
even
queerer
places
the
worst
of
her
was
that
she
could
tell
what
people
said
by
looking
at
their
lips
this
i
hated
but
as
i
grew
and
became
intelligent
her
ways
of
hiding
her
money
proved
useful
to
me
at
least
as
to
peninnah
she
was
nothing
special
until
she
suddenly
bloomed
out
into
a
rather
stout
pretty
girl
took
to
ribbons
and
liked
what
she
called
keeping
she
ran
errands
for
every
one
waited
on
my
aunt
and
thought
i
was
a
wonderful
person
as
indeed
i
was
i
never
could
understand
her
fondness
for
helping
everybody
a
fellow
has
got
himself
to
think
about
and
that
is
quite
enough
i
was
told
pretty
often
that
i
was
the
most
selfish
boy
alive
but
then
i
am
an
unusual
person
and
there
are
several
names
for
things
my
father
kept
a
small
shop
for
the
sale
of
legal
stationery
and
the
like
on
fifth
street
north
of
chestnut
but
his
chief
interest
in
life
lay
in
the
of
christ
church
he
was
leader
or
no
and
the
whole
business
was
in
the
hands
of
a
kind
of
guild
which
is
nearly
as
old
as
the
church
i
used
to
hear
more
of
it
than
i
liked
because
my
father
talked
of
nothing
else
but
i
do
not
mean
to
bore
myself
writing
of
bells
i
heard
too
much
about
back
shake
raising
in
peal
scales
and
touches
and
the
lord
knows
what
my
earliest
remembrance
is
of
sitting
on
my
father
s
shoulder
when
he
led
off
the
ringers
he
was
very
strong
as
i
said
by
reason
of
this
exercise
with
one
foot
caught
in
a
loop
of
leather
nailed
to
the
floor
he
would
begin
to
pull
no
and
by
and
by
the
whole
peal
would
be
swinging
and
he
going
up
and
down
to
my
joy
i
used
to
feel
as
if
it
was
i
that
was
making
the
great
noise
that
rang
out
all
over
the
town
my
familiar
acquaintance
with
the
old
church
and
its
where
were
stored
the
dusty
arms
of
william
and
mary
and
george
proved
of
use
in
my
later
days
my
father
had
a
strong
belief
in
my
talents
and
i
do
not
think
he
was
mistaken
as
he
was
quite
uneducated
he
determined
that
i
should
not
be
he
had
saved
enough
to
send
me
to
princeton
college
and
when
i
was
about
fifteen
i
was
set
free
from
the
public
schools
i
never
liked
them
the
last
i
was
at
was
the
high
school
as
i
had
to
come
to
get
home
we
used
to
meet
on
arch
street
the
boys
from
the
of
the
university
and
there
were
fights
every
week
in
winter
these
were
most
frequent
because
of
the
a
fellow
had
to
take
his
share
or
be
marked
as
a
deserter
i
never
saw
any
personal
good
to
be
had
out
of
a
fight
but
it
was
better
to
fight
than
to
be
cobbed
that
means
that
two
fellows
hold
you
and
the
other
fellows
kick
you
with
their
bent
knees
it
hurts
i
find
just
here
that
i
am
describing
a
thing
as
if
i
were
writing
for
some
other
people
to
see
i
may
as
well
go
on
that
way
after
all
a
man
never
can
quite
stand
off
and
look
at
himself
as
if
he
was
the
only
person
concerned
he
must
have
an
audience
or
make
believe
to
have
one
even
if
it
is
only
himself
nor
on
the
whole
should
i
be
unwilling
if
it
were
safe
to
let
people
see
how
great
ability
may
be
defeated
by
the
crankiness
of
fortune
i
may
add
here
that
a
stone
inside
of
a
snowball
discourages
the
fellow
it
hits
but
neither
our
fellows
nor
the
used
stones
in
snowballs
i
rather
liked
it
if
we
had
a
row
in
the
springtime
we
all
threw
stones
and
here
was
one
of
those
bits
of
stupid
custom
no
man
can
understand
because
really
a
stone
outside
of
a
snowball
is
much
more
serious
than
if
it
is
mercifully
padded
with
snow
i
felt
it
to
be
a
rise
in
life
when
i
got
out
of
the
society
of
the
common
boys
who
attended
the
high
school
when
i
was
there
a
man
by
the
name
of
dallas
bache
was
the
head
master
he
had
a
way
of
letting
the
boys
attend
to
what
he
called
the
character
of
the
school
once
i
had
to
lie
to
him
about
taking
another
boy
s
ball
he
told
my
class
that
i
had
denied
the
charge
and
that
he
always
took
it
for
granted
that
a
boy
spoke
the
truth
he
knew
well
enough
what
would
happen
it
did
after
that
i
was
careful
princeton
was
then
a
little
college
not
expensive
which
was
very
well
as
my
father
had
some
difficulty
to
provide
even
the
moderate
amount
needed
i
soon
found
that
if
i
was
to
associate
with
the
upper
set
of
young
men
i
needed
money
for
some
time
i
waited
in
vain
but
in
my
second
year
i
discovered
a
small
on
which
i
drew
with
a
moderation
which
shows
even
thus
early
the
strength
of
my
character
i
used
to
go
home
once
a
month
for
a
sunday
visit
and
on
these
occasions
i
was
often
able
to
remove
from
my
aunt
s
big
bible
a
or
note
which
otherwise
would
have
been
long
useless
now
and
then
i
utilized
my
opportunities
at
princeton
i
very
much
desired
certain
things
like
clothes
and
for
these
i
had
to
run
in
debt
to
a
tailor
when
he
wanted
pay
and
threatened
to
send
the
bill
to
my
father
i
borrowed
from
two
or
three
young
southerners
but
at
last
when
they
became
hard
up
my
aunt
s
uncounted
hoard
proved
a
last
resource
or
some
rare
chance
in
a
neighboring
room
helped
me
out
i
never
did
look
on
this
method
as
of
permanent
usefulness
and
it
was
only
the
temporary
folly
of
youth
whatever
else
the
pirate
necessity
appropriated
i
took
no
large
amount
of
education
although
i
was
fond
of
reading
and
especially
of
novels
which
are
i
think
very
instructive
to
the
young
especially
the
novels
of
smollett
and
fielding
there
is
however
little
need
to
dwell
on
this
part
of
my
life
college
students
in
those
days
were
only
boys
and
boys
are
very
strange
animals
they
have
instincts
they
somehow
get
to
know
if
a
fellow
does
not
relate
facts
as
they
took
place
i
like
to
put
it
that
way
because
after
all
the
mode
of
putting
things
is
only
one
of
the
forms
of
and
is
less
silly
than
the
ordinary
wriggling
methods
which
boys
employ
and
which
are
generally
useless
i
was
rather
given
to
telling
large
stories
just
for
the
fun
of
it
and
i
think
told
them
well
but
somehow
i
got
the
reputation
of
not
being
strictly
definite
and
when
it
was
meant
to
indicate
this
belief
they
had
an
way
of
informing
you
this
consisted
in
two
or
three
fellows
standing
up
and
shuffling
noisily
with
their
feet
on
the
floor
when
first
i
heard
this
i
asked
innocently
what
it
meant
and
was
told
it
was
the
noise
of
the
bearers
feet
coming
to
take
away
ananias
this
was
considered
a
fine
joke
during
my
junior
year
i
became
unpopular
and
as
i
was
very
cautious
i
can
not
see
why
at
last
being
hard
up
i
got
to
be
foolishly
reckless
but
why
dwell
on
the
failures
of
immaturity
the
causes
which
led
to
my
leaving
nassau
hall
were
not
after
all
the
mischievous
outbreaks
in
which
college
lads
indulge
indeed
i
have
never
been
guilty
of
any
of
those
pieces
of
wanton
wickedness
which
injure
the
feelings
of
others
while
they
lead
to
no
useful
result
when
i
left
to
return
home
i
set
myself
seriously
to
reflect
upon
the
necessity
of
greater
care
in
following
out
my
inclinations
and
from
that
time
forward
i
have
steadily
avoided
whenever
it
was
possible
the
vulgar
vice
of
directly
possessing
myself
of
objects
to
which
i
could
show
no
legal
title
my
father
was
indignant
at
the
results
of
my
college
career
and
according
to
my
aunt
his
shame
and
sorrow
had
some
effect
in
shortening
his
life
my
sister
believed
my
account
of
the
matter
it
ended
in
my
being
used
for
a
year
as
an
assistant
in
the
shop
and
in
being
taught
to
ring
bells
a
fine
exercise
but
not
proper
work
for
a
man
of
refinement
my
father
died
while
training
his
in
the
oxford
triple
bob
broke
a
somewhere
how
i
could
have
caused
that
i
do
not
see
i
was
now
about
nineteen
years
old
and
as
i
remember
a
young
fellow
with
large
eyes
a
slight
mustache
and
i
have
been
told
with
very
good
manners
and
a
somewhat
humorous
turn
besides
these
advantages
my
guardian
held
in
trust
for
me
about
two
thousand
dollars
after
some
consultation
between
us
it
was
resolved
that
i
should
study
medicine
this
conclusion
was
reached
nine
years
before
the
rebellion
broke
out
and
after
we
had
settled
for
the
sake
of
economy
in
woodbury
new
jersey
from
this
time
i
saw
very
little
of
my
deaf
aunt
or
of
peninnah
i
was
resolute
to
rise
in
the
world
and
not
to
be
weighted
by
relatives
who
were
without
my
tastes
and
my
manners
i
set
out
for
philadelphia
with
many
good
counsels
from
my
aunt
and
guardian
i
look
back
upon
this
period
as
a
of
my
life
i
had
seen
enough
of
the
world
already
to
know
that
if
you
can
succeed
without
exciting
suspicion
it
is
by
far
the
pleasantest
way
and
i
really
believe
that
if
i
had
not
been
endowed
with
so
fatal
a
liking
for
all
the
good
things
of
life
i
might
have
lived
along
as
reputably
as
most
men
this
however
is
and
always
has
been
my
difficulty
and
i
suppose
that
i
am
not
responsible
for
the
incidents
to
which
it
gave
rise
most
men
have
some
ties
in
life
but
i
have
said
i
had
none
which
held
me
peninnah
cried
a
good
deal
when
we
parted
and
this
i
think
as
i
was
still
young
had
a
very
good
effect
in
strengthening
my
resolution
to
do
nothing
which
could
get
me
into
trouble
the
janitor
of
the
college
to
which
i
went
directed
me
to
a
where
i
engaged
a
small
room
which
i
afterwards
shared
with
chaucer
of
georgia
he
pronounced
it
as
i
remember
in
this
very
remarkable
abode
i
spent
the
next
two
winters
and
finally
graduated
along
with
two
hundred
more
at
the
close
of
my
two
years
of
study
i
should
previously
have
been
one
year
in
a
physician
s
office
as
a
student
but
this
regulation
was
very
easily
evaded
as
to
my
studies
the
less
said
the
better
i
attended
the
quizzes
as
they
call
them
pretty
closely
and
being
of
a
quick
and
retentive
memory
was
thus
enabled
to
dispense
with
some
of
the
six
or
seven
lectures
a
day
which
duller
men
found
it
necessary
to
follow
dissecting
struck
me
as
a
rather
nasty
business
for
a
gentleman
and
on
this
account
i
did
just
as
little
as
was
absolutely
essential
in
fact
if
a
man
took
his
tickets
and
paid
the
dissection
fees
nobody
troubled
himself
as
to
whether
or
not
he
did
any
more
than
this
a
like
evil
existed
at
the
graduation
whether
you
squeezed
through
or
passed
with
credit
was
a
thing
which
was
not
made
public
so
that
i
had
absolutely
nothing
to
stimulate
my
ambition
i
am
told
that
it
is
all
very
different
the
astonishment
with
which
i
learned
of
my
success
was
shared
by
the
numerous
southern
gentlemen
who
darkened
the
floors
and
perfumed
with
tobacco
the
rooms
of
our
in
my
companions
during
the
time
of
my
studies
so
called
as
in
other
matters
of
life
i
was
somewhat
unfortunate
all
of
them
were
southern
gentlemen
with
more
money
than
i
had
many
of
them
carried
great
sticks
usually
and
some
or
pistols
also
they
delighted
in
coats
long
hair
felt
hats
and
very
tight
boots
i
often
think
of
these
gentlemen
with
affectionate
interest
and
wonder
how
many
are
lying
under
the
of
virginia
one
could
see
them
any
day
sauntering
along
with
their
arms
over
their
companions
shoulders
splendidly
indifferent
to
the
ways
of
the
people
about
them
they
hated
the
nawth
and
cursed
the
yankees
and
honestly
believed
that
the
leanest
of
them
was
a
match
for
any
half
a
dozen
of
the
bulkiest
of
northerners
i
must
also
do
them
the
justice
to
say
that
they
were
quite
as
ready
to
fight
as
to
brag
which
by
the
way
is
no
meager
statement
with
these
gentry
for
whom
i
retain
a
respect
which
filled
me
with
regret
at
the
recent
course
of
events
i
spent
a
good
deal
of
my
large
leisure
the
more
studious
of
both
sections
called
us
a
hard
crowd
what
we
did
or
how
we
did
it
little
concerns
me
here
except
that
owing
to
my
esteem
for
chivalric
blood
and
breeding
i
was
led
into
many
practices
and
excesses
which
cost
my
guardian
and
myself
a
good
deal
of
money
at
the
close
of
my
career
as
a
student
i
found
myself
aged
years
and
the
owner
of
some
seven
hundred
dollars
the
rest
of
my
small
estate
having
disappeared
variously
within
the
last
two
years
after
my
friends
had
gone
to
their
homes
in
the
south
i
began
to
look
about
me
for
an
office
and
finally
settled
upon
very
good
rooms
in
one
of
the
localities
of
the
quaker
city
i
am
not
specific
as
to
the
number
and
street
for
reasons
which
may
hereafter
appear
i
liked
the
situation
on
various
accounts
it
had
been
occupied
by
a
doctor
the
terms
were
reasonable
and
it
lay
on
the
skirts
of
a
good
neighborhood
while
below
it
lived
a
motley
population
among
which
i
expected
to
get
my
first
patients
and
such
fees
as
were
to
be
had
into
this
new
home
i
moved
my
medical
a
few
bones
and
myself
also
i
displayed
in
the
window
a
fresh
sign
upon
which
was
distinctly
to
be
read
sanderaft
office
hours
to
to
i
felt
now
that
i
had
done
my
fair
share
toward
attaining
a
virtuous
subsistence
and
so
i
waited
tranquilly
and
without
undue
enthusiasm
to
see
the
rest
of
the
world
do
its
part
in
the
matter
meanwhile
i
read
up
on
all
sorts
of
imaginable
cases
stayed
at
home
all
through
my
office
hours
and
at
intervals
explored
the
strange
section
of
the
town
which
lay
to
the
south
of
my
office
i
do
not
suppose
there
is
anything
like
it
else
where
it
was
then
filled
with
brothels
and
low
you
could
dine
for
a
penny
on
soup
made
from
the
refuse
meats
of
the
rich
gathered
at
back
gates
by
a
horde
of
children
who
all
told
varieties
of
one
woeful
tale
here
too
you
could
be
drunk
for
five
cents
and
be
lodged
for
three
with
men
women
and
children
of
all
colors
lying
about
you
it
was
this
hideous
mixture
of
black
and
white
and
yellow
wretchedness
which
made
the
place
so
peculiar
the
blacks
predominated
and
had
mostly
that
swollen
reddish
dark
skin
the
sign
in
this
race
of
habitual
drunkenness
of
course
only
the
lowest
whites
were
here
pawnbrokers
men
thieves
and
the
like
all
of
this
as
it
came
before
me
i
viewed
with
mingled
disgust
and
philosophy
i
hated
filth
but
i
understood
that
society
has
to
stand
on
somebody
and
i
was
only
glad
that
i
was
not
one
of
the
undermost
and
bricks
i
can
hardly
believe
that
i
waited
a
month
without
having
been
called
upon
by
a
single
patient
at
last
a
policeman
on
our
beat
brought
me
a
fancy
man
with
a
this
patient
recommended
me
to
his
brother
the
keeper
of
a
small
and
by
very
slow
degrees
i
began
to
get
stray
patients
who
were
too
poor
to
indulge
in
doctors
i
found
the
police
very
useful
acquaintances
and
by
a
drink
or
a
cigar
now
and
then
i
got
most
of
the
cases
of
cut
heads
and
the
like
at
the
next
these
however
were
the
aristocrats
of
my
practice
the
bulk
of
my
patients
were
men
oystermen
bummers
and
worse
with
other
and
nameless
trades
men
and
women
white
black
or
mulatto
how
they
got
the
levies
fips
and
quarters
with
which
i
was
reluctantly
paid
i
do
not
know
that
indeed
was
none
of
my
business
they
expected
to
pay
and
they
came
to
me
in
preference
to
the
dispensary
doctor
two
or
three
squares
away
who
seemed
to
me
to
spend
most
of
his
days
in
the
lanes
and
alleys
about
us
of
course
he
received
no
pay
except
experience
since
the
dispensaries
in
the
quaker
city
as
a
rule
do
not
give
salaries
to
their
doctors
and
the
vilest
of
the
poor
prefer
a
pay
doctor
to
one
of
these
disinterested
gentlemen
who
can
not
be
expected
to
give
their
best
brains
for
nothing
when
at
everybody
s
beck
and
call
i
am
told
indeed
i
know
that
most
young
doctors
do
a
large
amount
of
poor
practice
as
it
is
called
but
for
my
own
part
i
think
it
better
for
both
parties
when
the
doctor
insists
upon
some
compensation
being
made
to
him
this
has
been
usually
my
own
custom
and
i
have
not
found
reason
to
regret
it
notwithstanding
my
strict
attention
to
my
own
interests
i
have
been
rather
sorely
dealt
with
by
fate
upon
several
occasions
where
so
far
as
i
could
see
i
was
vigilantly
doing
everything
in
my
power
to
keep
myself
out
of
trouble
or
danger
i
may
as
well
relate
one
of
them
merely
to
illustrate
of
how
little
value
a
man
s
intellect
may
be
when
fate
and
the
prejudices
of
the
mass
of
men
are
against
him
one
evening
late
i
myself
answered
a
ring
at
the
bell
and
found
a
small
black
boy
on
the
steps
a
shoeless
hatless
little
wretch
curled
darkness
for
hair
and
teeth
like
new
tombstones
it
was
pretty
cold
and
he
was
relieving
his
feet
by
standing
first
on
one
and
then
on
the
other
he
did
not
wait
for
me
to
speak
hi
sah
missey
barker
she
say
to
come
quick
away
sah
to
numbah
bedford
the
locality
did
not
look
like
pay
but
it
is
hard
to
say
in
this
quarter
because
sometimes
you
found
a
local
for
or
a
ditto
for
shoemaker
with
next
door
in
a
house
better
or
worse
dozens
of
human
rats
for
whom
every
police
trap
in
the
city
was
constantly
set
with
a
doubt
in
my
mind
as
to
whether
i
should
find
a
good
patient
or
some
dirty
nigger
i
sought
the
place
to
which
i
had
been
directed
i
did
not
like
its
looks
but
i
blundered
up
an
alley
and
into
a
back
room
where
i
fell
over
somebody
and
was
cursed
and
told
to
lie
down
and
keep
easy
or
somebody
meaning
the
man
stumbled
over
would
make
me
at
last
i
lit
on
a
staircase
which
led
into
the
alley
and
after
much
useless
inquiry
got
as
high
as
the
garret
people
hereabout
did
not
know
one
another
or
did
not
want
to
know
so
that
it
was
of
little
avail
to
ask
questions
at
length
i
saw
a
light
through
the
cracks
in
the
attic
door
and
walked
in
to
my
amazement
the
first
person
i
saw
was
a
woman
of
about
in
quaker
dress
one
of
your
quiet
people
she
was
seated
on
a
stool
beside
a
straw
mattress
upon
which
lay
a
black
woman
there
were
three
others
crowded
close
around
a
small
stove
which
was
an
unusual
spectacle
in
this
street
altogether
a
most
nasty
den
as
i
came
in
the
little
quaker
woman
got
up
and
said
i
took
the
liberty
of
sending
for
thee
to
look
at
this
poor
woman
i
am
afraid
she
has
the
smallpox
will
thee
be
so
kind
as
to
look
at
her
and
with
this
she
held
down
the
candle
toward
the
bed
good
gracious
i
said
hastily
seeing
how
the
creature
was
speckled
i
didn
t
understand
this
or
i
would
not
have
come
i
have
important
cases
which
i
can
not
subject
to
the
risk
of
contagion
best
let
her
alone
miss
i
added
or
send
her
to
the
smallpox
upon
my
word
i
was
astonished
at
the
little
woman
s
indignation
she
said
just
those
things
which
make
you
feel
as
if
somebody
had
been
calling
you
names
or
kicking
you
was
i
really
a
doctor
and
so
on
it
did
not
gain
by
being
put
in
the
ungrammatical
tongue
of
quakers
however
i
never
did
fancy
smallpox
and
what
could
a
fellow
get
by
doctoring
wretches
like
these
so
i
held
my
tongue
and
went
away
about
a
week
afterwards
i
met
evans
the
dispensary
man
a
very
common
fellow
who
was
said
to
be
frank
helloa
says
he
doctor
you
made
a
nice
mistake
about
that
darky
at
no
bedford
street
the
other
night
she
had
nothing
but
measles
after
of
course
i
knew
said
i
laughing
but
you
don
t
think
i
was
going
in
for
dispensary
trash
do
you
i
should
think
not
said
evans
i
learned
afterwards
that
this
miss
barker
had
taken
an
absurd
fancy
to
the
man
because
he
had
doctored
the
darky
and
would
not
let
the
quakeress
pay
him
the
end
was
when
i
wanted
to
get
a
vacancy
in
the
southwark
dispensary
where
they
do
pay
the
doctors
miss
barker
was
malignant
enough
to
take
advantage
of
my
oversight
by
telling
the
whole
story
to
the
board
so
that
evans
got
in
and
i
was
beaten
you
may
be
pretty
sure
that
i
found
rather
slow
the
kind
of
practice
i
have
described
and
began
to
look
about
for
chances
of
bettering
myself
in
this
sort
of
locality
rather
risky
cases
turned
up
now
and
then
and
as
soon
as
i
got
to
be
known
as
a
reliable
man
i
began
to
get
the
peculiar
sort
of
practice
i
wanted
notwithstanding
all
my
efforts
i
found
myself
at
the
close
of
three
years
with
all
my
means
spent
and
just
able
to
live
meagerly
from
hand
to
mouth
which
by
no
means
suited
a
man
of
my
refined
tastes
once
or
twice
i
paid
a
visit
to
my
aunt
and
was
able
to
secure
moderate
aid
by
overhauling
her
concealed
hoardings
but
as
to
these
changes
of
property
i
was
careful
and
did
not
venture
to
secure
the
large
amount
i
needed
as
to
the
bible
it
was
at
this
time
hidden
and
i
judged
it
therefore
to
be
her
chief
place
of
deposit
banks
she
utterly
distrusted
six
months
went
by
and
i
was
worse
off
than
ever
two
months
in
arrears
of
rent
and
numerous
other
debts
to
and
now
and
then
some
good
job
such
as
a
burglar
with
a
cut
head
helped
me
for
a
while
but
on
the
whole
i
was
like
slider
downeyhylle
in
neal
s
charcoal
sketches
and
kept
going
downer
and
downer
the
more
i
tried
not
to
something
had
to
be
done
it
occurred
to
me
about
this
time
that
if
i
moved
into
a
more
genteel
locality
i
might
get
a
better
class
of
patients
and
yet
keep
the
best
of
those
i
now
had
to
do
this
it
was
necessary
to
pay
my
rent
and
the
more
so
because
i
was
in
a
fair
way
to
have
no
house
at
all
over
my
head
but
here
fortune
interposed
i
was
caught
in
a
heavy
rainstorm
on
seventh
street
and
ran
to
catch
an
omnibus
as
i
pulled
open
the
door
i
saw
behind
me
the
quaker
woman
miss
barker
i
laughed
and
jumped
in
she
had
to
run
a
little
before
the
bus
again
stopped
she
got
pretty
wet
an
old
man
in
the
corner
who
seemed
in
the
way
of
taking
charge
of
other
people
s
manners
said
to
me
young
man
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
get
in
before
the
lady
and
in
this
pour
too
i
said
calmly
but
you
got
in
before
he
made
no
reply
to
this
obvious
fact
as
he
might
have
been
in
the
bus
a
a
large
man
near
by
said
with
a
laugh
rather
neat
that
and
turning
tried
to
pull
up
a
in
the
effort
something
happened
and
he
broke
the
glass
cutting
his
hand
in
half
a
dozen
places
while
he
was
using
several
quite
profane
phrases
i
caught
his
hand
and
said
i
am
a
surgeon
and
tied
my
handkerchief
around
the
bleeding
palm
the
guardian
of
manners
said
i
hope
you
are
not
much
hurt
but
there
was
no
reason
why
you
should
on
this
my
patient
said
go
to
which
silenced
the
monitor
i
explained
to
the
wounded
man
that
the
cuts
should
be
looked
after
at
once
the
matter
was
arranged
by
our
leaving
the
bus
and
as
the
rain
had
let
up
walking
to
his
house
this
was
a
large
and
quite
luxurious
dwelling
on
fourth
street
there
i
cared
for
his
wounds
which
as
i
had
informed
him
required
immediate
attention
it
was
at
this
time
summer
and
his
wife
and
niece
the
only
other
members
of
his
family
were
absent
on
my
second
visit
i
made
believe
to
remove
some
splinters
of
glass
which
i
brought
with
me
he
said
they
showed
how
shamefully
thin
was
that
omnibus
to
my
surprise
my
patient
at
the
end
of
the
month
for
one
wound
was
long
in
healing
presented
me
with
one
hundred
dollars
this
paid
my
small
rental
and
as
poynter
allowed
me
to
refer
to
him
i
was
able
to
get
a
better
office
and
bedroom
on
spruce
street
i
saw
no
more
of
my
patient
until
winter
although
i
learned
that
he
was
a
not
in
the
very
best
repute
but
of
a
family
meanwhile
my
move
had
been
of
small
use
i
was
wise
enough
however
to
keep
up
my
connection
with
my
former
clients
and
contrived
to
live
it
was
no
more
than
that
one
day
in
december
i
was
overjoyed
to
see
poynter
enter
he
was
a
fat
man
very
pale
and
never
to
my
remembrance
without
a
permanent
smile
he
had
very
civil
ways
and
now
at
once
i
saw
that
he
wanted
something
i
hated
the
way
that
man
saw
through
me
he
went
on
without
hesitation
taking
me
for
granted
he
began
by
saying
he
had
confidence
in
my
judgment
and
when
a
man
says
that
you
had
better
look
out
he
said
he
had
a
niece
who
lived
with
him
a
brother
s
child
that
she
was
out
of
health
and
ought
not
to
marry
which
was
what
she
meant
to
do
she
was
scared
about
her
health
because
she
had
a
cough
and
had
lost
a
brother
of
consumption
i
soon
came
to
understand
that
for
reasons
unknown
to
me
my
friend
did
not
wish
his
niece
to
marry
his
wife
he
also
informed
me
was
troubled
as
to
the
niece
s
health
now
he
said
he
wished
to
consult
me
as
to
what
he
should
do
i
suspected
at
once
that
he
had
not
told
me
all
i
have
often
wondered
at
the
skill
with
which
i
managed
this
rather
delicate
matter
i
knew
i
was
not
well
enough
known
to
be
of
direct
use
and
was
also
too
young
to
have
much
weight
i
advised
him
to
get
professor
then
my
friend
shook
his
head
he
said
in
reply
but
suppose
doctor
he
says
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
girl
then
i
began
to
understand
him
oh
i
said
you
get
a
confidential
written
opinion
from
him
you
can
make
it
what
you
please
when
you
tell
he
said
no
it
would
be
best
for
me
to
ask
the
professor
to
see
miss
poynter
might
mention
my
youth
and
so
on
as
a
reason
i
was
to
get
his
opinion
in
writing
well
said
i
after
that
i
want
you
to
write
me
a
joint
opinion
to
meet
the
case
all
the
needs
of
the
case
you
i
saw
but
hesitated
as
to
how
much
would
make
it
worth
while
to
pull
his
hot
chestnuts
out
of
the
fire
one
never
knows
how
hot
the
chestnuts
are
then
he
said
ever
take
a
chance
in
stocks
i
said
he
said
that
he
would
lend
me
a
little
money
and
see
what
he
could
do
with
it
and
here
was
his
receipt
from
me
for
one
thousand
dollars
and
here
too
was
my
order
to
buy
shares
of
y
would
i
please
to
sign
it
i
did
i
was
to
call
in
two
days
at
his
house
and
meantime
i
could
think
it
over
it
seemed
to
me
a
pretty
weak
plan
suppose
the
young
woman
well
supposing
is
awfully
destructive
of
enterprise
and
as
for
me
i
had
only
to
misunderstand
the
professor
s
opinion
i
went
to
the
house
and
talked
to
poynter
about
his
gout
then
poynter
came
in
and
began
to
lament
her
niece
s
declining
health
after
that
i
saw
miss
poynter
there
is
a
kind
of
woman
who
knows
no
more
of
the
world
than
a
young
chicken
and
is
of
emotions
i
saw
it
would
be
easy
to
frighten
her
there
are
some
instruments
anybody
can
get
any
tune
they
like
out
of
i
was
very
grave
and
advised
her
to
see
the
professor
and
would
i
write
to
ask
him
said
poynter
i
said
i
would
as
i
went
out
poynter
remarked
you
will
clear
some
four
hundred
easy
write
to
the
professor
bring
my
receipt
to
the
office
next
week
and
we
will
we
settled
i
tore
up
his
receipt
and
gave
him
one
for
fifteen
hundred
dollars
and
received
in
notes
five
hundred
dollars
in
a
day
or
so
i
had
a
note
from
the
professor
stating
that
miss
poynter
was
in
no
peril
that
she
was
as
he
thought
worried
and
had
only
a
mild
bronchial
trouble
he
advised
me
to
do
and
had
ventured
to
reassure
my
young
patient
now
this
was
a
little
more
than
i
wanted
however
i
wrote
poynter
that
the
professor
thought
she
had
bronchitis
that
in
her
case
tubercle
would
be
very
apt
to
follow
and
that
at
present
and
until
she
was
safe
we
considered
marriage
undesirable
poynter
said
it
might
have
been
put
stronger
but
he
would
make
it
do
he
made
it
the
first
effect
was
an
attack
of
hysterics
the
final
result
was
that
she
eloped
with
her
lover
because
if
she
was
to
die
as
she
wrote
her
aunt
she
wished
to
die
in
her
husband
s
arms
human
nature
plus
hysteria
will
defy
all
knowledge
of
character
this
was
what
our
old
professor
of
practice
used
to
say
poynter
had
now
to
account
for
a
large
trust
estate
which
had
somehow
dwindled
unhappily
princes
are
not
the
only
people
in
whom
you
must
not
put
your
trust
as
to
myself
professor
somehow
got
to
know
the
facts
and
cut
me
dead
it
was
unpleasant
but
i
had
my
five
hundred
dollars
and
i
needed
them
i
do
not
see
how
i
could
have
been
more
careful
after
this
things
got
worse
poynter
broke
and
did
not
even
pay
my
last
bill
i
had
to
accept
several
rather
doubtful
cases
and
once
a
policeman
i
knew
advised
me
that
i
had
better
be
on
my
guard
but
really
so
long
as
i
adhered
to
the
common
code
of
my
profession
i
was
in
danger
of
going
without
my
dinner
just
as
i
was
at
my
worst
and
in
despair
something
always
turned
up
but
it
was
sure
to
be
risky
and
now
my
aunt
refused
to
see
me
and
peninnah
wrote
me
letters
and
said
aunt
rachel
had
been
unable
to
find
certain
she
had
hidden
and
vowed
i
had
taken
them
this
peninnah
did
not
think
possible
i
agreed
with
her
the
notes
were
found
somewhat
later
by
peninnah
in
the
toes
of
a
pair
of
my
aunt
s
old
slippers
of
course
i
wrote
an
indignant
letter
my
aunt
declared
that
peninnah
had
stolen
the
notes
and
restored
them
when
they
were
missed
poor
peninnah
this
did
not
seem
to
me
very
likely
but
peninnah
did
love
fine
clothes
one
night
as
i
was
debating
with
myself
as
to
how
i
was
to
improve
my
position
i
heard
a
knock
on
my
shutter
and
going
to
the
door
let
in
a
man
with
a
whisky
face
and
a
great
hooked
nose
he
wore
a
heavy
black
beard
and
mustache
and
looked
like
the
wolf
in
the
pictures
of
red
which
i
had
seen
as
a
child
your
name
s
sanderaft
said
the
man
yes
that
s
my
name
as
he
sat
down
he
shook
the
snow
over
everything
and
said
coolly
set
down
doc
i
want
to
talk
with
what
can
i
do
for
you
said
i
the
man
looked
around
the
room
rather
scornfully
at
the
same
time
throwing
back
his
coat
and
displaying
a
red
neckerchief
and
a
huge
garnet
pin
guess
you
re
not
overly
rich
he
said
not
especially
said
i
what
s
that
your
business
he
did
not
answer
but
merely
said
know
simon
stagers
can
t
say
i
do
said
i
cautiously
simon
was
a
burglar
who
had
blown
off
two
fingers
when
mining
a
safe
i
had
attended
him
while
he
was
hiding
can
t
say
you
do
well
you
can
lie
and
no
mistake
come
now
doc
simon
says
you
re
safe
and
i
want
to
have
a
leetle
plain
talk
with
with
this
he
laid
ten
gold
eagles
on
the
table
i
put
out
my
hand
instinctively
let
em
alone
cried
the
man
sharply
they
re
easy
earned
and
ten
more
like
for
doing
what
i
said
the
man
paused
a
moment
and
looked
around
him
next
he
stared
at
me
and
loosened
his
cravat
with
a
hasty
pull
you
re
the
coroner
said
he
i
what
do
you
mean
yes
you
re
the
coroner
don
t
you
understand
and
so
saying
he
shoved
the
gold
pieces
toward
me
very
good
said
i
we
will
suppose
i
m
the
coroner
what
next
and
being
the
coroner
said
he
you
get
this
note
which
requests
you
to
call
at
no
blank
street
to
examine
the
body
of
a
young
man
which
is
supposed
only
supposed
you
see
to
have
well
to
have
died
under
suspicious
go
on
said
i
no
he
returned
not
till
i
know
how
you
like
it
stagers
and
another
knows
it
and
it
wouldn
t
be
very
safe
for
you
to
split
besides
not
making
nothing
out
of
it
but
what
i
say
is
this
do
you
like
the
business
of
coroner
i
did
not
like
it
but
just
then
two
hundred
in
gold
was
life
to
me
so
i
said
let
me
hear
the
whole
of
it
first
i
am
that
s
square
enough
said
the
man
my
wife
s
got
correcting
himself
with
a
shivery
shrug
my
wife
had
a
brother
that
took
to
cutting
up
rough
because
when
i
d
been
up
too
late
i
handled
her
a
leetle
hard
now
and
again
luckily
he
fell
sick
with
typhoid
just
then
you
see
he
lived
with
us
when
he
got
better
i
guessed
he
d
drop
all
that
but
somehow
he
was
worse
than
ever
clean
off
his
head
and
strong
as
an
ox
my
wife
said
to
put
him
away
in
an
asylum
i
didn
t
think
that
would
do
at
last
he
tried
to
get
out
he
was
going
to
see
the
police
about
well
the
thing
was
awful
serious
and
my
wife
carrying
on
like
mad
and
wanting
doctors
i
had
no
mind
to
run
and
something
had
got
to
be
done
so
simon
stagers
and
i
talked
it
over
the
end
of
it
was
he
took
worse
of
a
sudden
and
got
so
he
didn
t
know
nothing
then
i
rushed
for
a
doctor
he
said
it
was
a
perforation
and
there
ought
to
have
been
a
doctor
when
he
was
first
took
sick
well
the
man
died
and
as
i
kept
about
the
house
my
wife
had
no
chance
to
talk
the
doctor
fussed
a
bit
but
at
last
he
gave
a
certificate
i
thought
we
were
done
with
it
but
my
wife
she
writes
a
note
and
gives
it
to
a
boy
in
the
alley
to
put
in
the
post
we
suspicioned
her
and
stagers
was
on
the
watch
after
the
boy
got
away
a
bit
simon
bribed
him
with
a
quarter
to
give
him
the
note
which
wasn
t
no
less
than
a
request
to
the
coroner
to
come
to
the
house
and
make
an
examination
as
foul
play
was
suspected
and
when
the
man
quit
talking
he
glared
at
me
i
sat
still
i
was
cold
all
over
i
was
afraid
to
go
on
and
afraid
to
go
back
besides
which
i
did
not
doubt
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
money
in
the
case
of
course
said
i
it
s
nonsense
only
i
suppose
you
don
t
want
the
officers
about
and
a
fuss
and
that
sort
of
exactly
said
my
friend
it
s
all
bosh
about
poison
you
re
the
coroner
you
take
this
note
and
come
to
my
house
says
you
mrs
file
are
you
the
woman
that
wrote
this
note
because
in
that
case
i
must
examine
the
i
see
said
i
she
needn
t
know
who
i
am
or
anything
else
but
if
i
tell
her
it
s
all
right
do
you
think
she
won
t
want
to
know
why
there
isn
t
a
jury
and
so
on
bless
you
said
the
man
the
girl
isn
t
over
seventeen
and
doesn
t
know
no
more
than
a
baby
as
we
live
miles
away
she
won
t
know
anything
about
i
ll
do
it
said
i
suddenly
for
as
i
saw
it
involved
no
sort
of
risk
but
i
must
have
three
hundred
and
fifty
added
the
wolf
if
you
do
it
then
i
knew
it
was
serious
with
this
the
man
buttoned
about
him
a
shaggy
gray
overcoat
and
took
his
leave
without
a
single
word
in
addition
a
minute
later
he
came
back
and
said
stagers
is
in
this
business
and
i
was
to
remind
you
of
lou
wilson
i
forgot
that
the
woman
that
died
last
year
that
s
then
he
went
away
leaving
me
in
a
cold
sweat
i
knew
now
i
had
no
choice
i
understood
why
i
had
been
selected
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
night
i
couldn
t
sleep
i
thought
to
myself
at
last
that
i
would
get
up
early
pack
a
few
clothes
and
escape
leaving
my
books
to
pay
as
they
might
my
arrears
of
rent
looking
out
of
the
window
however
in
the
morning
i
saw
stagers
prowling
about
the
opposite
pavement
and
as
the
only
exit
except
the
street
door
was
an
alleyway
which
opened
of
the
front
of
the
house
i
gave
myself
up
for
lost
about
ten
o
clock
i
took
my
case
of
instruments
and
started
for
file
s
house
followed
as
i
too
well
understood
by
stagers
i
knew
the
house
which
was
in
a
small
uptown
street
by
its
closed
windows
and
the
craped
bell
which
i
shuddered
as
i
touched
however
it
was
too
late
to
draw
back
and
i
therefore
inquired
for
mrs
file
a
young
woman
came
down
and
led
me
into
a
small
parlor
for
whose
darkened
light
i
was
thankful
enough
did
you
write
this
note
i
did
said
the
woman
if
you
re
the
coroner
joe
file
he
s
my
husband
he
s
gone
out
to
see
about
the
funeral
i
wish
it
was
his
i
what
do
you
suspect
said
i
i
ll
tell
you
she
returned
in
a
whisper
i
think
he
was
made
away
with
i
think
there
was
foul
play
i
think
he
was
poisoned
that
s
what
i
i
hope
you
may
be
mistaken
said
i
suppose
you
let
me
see
the
you
shall
see
it
she
replied
and
following
her
i
went
to
a
front
chamber
where
i
found
the
corpse
get
it
over
soon
said
the
woman
with
strange
firmness
if
there
ain
t
no
murder
been
done
i
shall
have
to
run
for
it
if
there
was
and
her
face
set
hard
i
guess
i
ll
with
this
she
closed
the
door
and
left
me
with
the
dead
if
i
had
known
what
was
before
me
i
never
could
have
gone
into
the
thing
at
all
it
looked
a
little
better
when
i
had
opened
a
window
and
let
in
plenty
of
light
for
although
i
was
on
the
whole
far
less
afraid
of
dead
than
living
men
i
had
an
absurd
feeling
that
i
was
doing
this
dead
man
a
distinct
wrong
as
if
it
mattered
to
the
dead
after
all
when
the
affair
was
over
i
thought
more
of
the
possible
consequences
than
of
its
relation
to
the
dead
man
himself
but
do
as
i
would
at
the
time
i
was
in
a
ridiculous
funk
and
especially
when
going
through
the
forms
of
a
examination
i
am
free
to
confess
now
that
i
was
careful
not
to
uncover
the
man
s
face
and
that
when
it
was
over
i
backed
to
the
door
and
hastily
escaped
from
the
room
on
the
stairs
opposite
to
me
mrs
file
was
seated
with
her
bonnet
on
and
a
bundle
in
her
hand
well
said
she
rising
as
she
spoke
and
with
a
certain
eagerness
in
her
tone
what
killed
him
was
it
poison
poison
my
good
woman
said
i
when
a
man
has
typhoid
fever
he
don
t
need
poison
to
kill
him
he
had
a
relapse
that
s
and
do
you
mean
to
say
he
wasn
t
poisoned
said
she
with
more
than
a
trace
of
disappointment
in
her
voice
not
poisoned
at
all
no
more
than
you
are
said
i
if
i
had
found
any
signs
of
foul
play
i
should
have
had
a
regular
inquest
as
it
is
the
less
said
about
it
the
better
the
fact
is
it
would
have
been
much
wiser
to
have
kept
quiet
at
the
beginning
i
can
t
understand
why
you
should
have
troubled
me
about
it
at
all
the
man
had
a
perforation
it
is
common
enough
in
that
s
what
the
doctor
said
i
didn
t
believe
him
i
guess
now
the
sooner
i
leave
the
better
for
as
to
that
i
returned
it
is
none
of
my
business
but
you
may
rest
certain
about
the
cause
of
your
brother
s
my
fears
were
somewhat
quieted
that
evening
when
stagers
and
the
wolf
appeared
with
the
remainder
of
the
money
and
i
learned
that
mrs
file
had
fled
from
her
home
and
as
file
thought
likely
from
the
city
also
a
few
months
later
file
himself
disappeared
and
stagers
found
his
way
for
the
third
time
into
the
penitentiary
then
i
felt
at
ease
i
now
see
for
my
own
part
that
i
was
guilty
of
more
than
one
mistake
and
that
i
displayed
throughout
a
want
of
intelligence
i
ought
to
have
asked
more
and
also
might
have
got
a
good
fee
from
mrs
file
on
account
of
my
services
as
coroner
it
served
me
however
as
a
good
lesson
but
it
was
several
months
before
i
felt
quite
comfortable
meanwhile
money
became
scarce
once
more
and
i
was
driven
to
my
wit
s
end
to
devise
how
i
should
continue
to
live
as
i
had
done
i
tried
among
other
plans
that
of
keeping
certain
pills
and
other
medicines
which
i
sold
to
my
patients
but
on
the
whole
i
found
it
better
to
send
all
my
prescriptions
to
one
druggist
who
charged
the
patient
ten
or
twenty
cents
over
the
correct
price
and
handed
this
amount
to
me
in
some
cases
i
am
told
the
percentage
is
supposed
to
be
a
donation
on
the
part
of
the
apothecary
but
i
rather
fancy
the
patient
pays
for
it
in
the
end
it
is
one
of
the
absurd
vagaries
of
the
profession
to
discountenance
the
practice
i
have
described
but
i
wish
for
my
part
i
had
never
done
anything
more
foolish
or
more
dangerous
of
course
it
inclines
a
doctor
to
change
his
medicines
a
good
deal
and
to
order
them
in
large
quantities
which
is
occasionally
annoying
to
the
poor
yet
as
i
have
always
observed
there
is
no
poverty
as
painful
as
your
own
so
that
i
prefer
to
distribute
pecuniary
suffering
among
many
rather
than
to
concentrate
it
on
myself
that
s
a
rather
neat
phrase
about
six
months
after
the
date
of
this
annoying
adventure
an
incident
occurred
which
altered
somewhat
and
for
a
time
improved
my
professional
position
during
my
morning
an
old
woman
came
in
and
putting
down
a
large
basket
wiped
her
face
with
a
handkerchief
and
afterwards
with
the
corner
of
her
apron
then
she
looked
around
uneasily
got
up
settled
her
basket
on
her
arm
with
a
jerk
which
may
have
decided
the
future
of
an
egg
or
two
and
remarked
briskly
don
t
see
no
little
bottles
about
got
the
wrong
stall
i
guess
you
ain
t
no
homeopath
doctor
are
you
with
great
presence
of
mind
i
replied
well
ma
am
that
depends
upon
what
you
want
some
of
my
patients
like
one
and
some
like
the
i
was
about
to
add
you
pay
your
money
and
you
take
your
choice
but
thought
better
of
it
and
held
my
peace
refraining
from
classical
quotation
being
as
that
s
the
case
said
the
old
lady
i
ll
just
tell
you
my
symptoms
you
said
you
give
either
kind
of
medicine
didn
t
you
just
so
replied
i
clams
or
oysters
whichever
opens
most
lively
as
my
old
joe
says
tends
the
at
stall
no
happen
to
know
joe
no
i
did
not
know
joe
but
what
were
the
symptoms
they
proved
to
be
numerous
and
included
a
stunning
in
the
head
and
a
misery
in
the
side
with
bokin
after
victuals
i
proceeded
of
course
to
apply
a
stethoscope
over
her
ample
bosom
though
what
i
heard
on
this
and
similar
occasions
i
should
find
it
rather
difficult
to
state
i
remember
well
my
astonishment
in
one
instance
where
having
unconsciously
applied
my
instrument
over
a
clamorous
silver
watch
in
the
watchfob
of
a
i
concluded
for
a
moment
that
he
was
suffering
from
a
rather
remarkable
displacement
of
the
heart
as
to
my
old
lady
whose
name
was
checkers
and
who
kept
an
near
by
i
told
her
that
i
was
out
of
pills
just
then
but
would
have
plenty
next
day
accordingly
i
proceeded
to
invest
a
small
amount
at
a
place
called
a
homeopathic
pharmacy
which
i
remember
amused
me
immensely
a
stout
little
german
with
great
silver
spectacles
sat
behind
a
counter
containing
numerous
jars
of
white
powders
labeled
concisely
while
behind
him
were
shelves
filled
with
bottles
of
what
looked
like
minute
white
shot
i
want
some
homeopathic
medicine
said
i
vat
kindt
said
my
friend
vat
you
vants
to
cure
i
explained
at
random
that
i
wished
to
treat
diseases
in
general
vell
ve
gifs
you
a
case
mit
a
pook
and
thereon
produced
a
large
box
containing
bottles
of
small
pills
and
powders
labeled
variously
with
the
names
of
the
diseases
so
that
all
you
required
was
to
use
the
headache
or
colic
bottle
in
order
to
meet
the
needs
of
those
particular
maladies
i
was
struck
at
first
with
the
exquisite
simplicity
of
this
arrangement
but
before
purchasing
i
happened
luckily
to
turn
over
the
leaves
of
a
book
in
two
volumes
which
lay
on
the
counter
it
was
called
jahr
s
opening
at
page
vol
i
i
lit
upon
lachesis
which
proved
to
my
amazement
to
be
this
jahr
stated
to
be
indicated
for
use
in
upward
of
a
hundred
symptoms
at
once
it
occurred
to
me
that
was
the
medicine
for
my
money
and
that
it
was
quite
needless
to
waste
cash
on
the
box
i
therefore
bought
a
small
jar
of
and
a
lot
of
little
pills
and
started
for
home
my
old
woman
proved
a
fast
friend
and
as
she
sent
me
numerous
patients
i
by
and
by
altered
my
sign
to
homeopathic
physician
and
surgeon
whatever
that
may
mean
and
was
regarded
by
my
medical
brothers
as
a
lost
sheep
and
by
the
doctors
as
one
who
had
seen
the
error
of
his
ways
in
point
of
fact
my
new
practice
had
decided
advantages
all
pills
looked
and
tasted
alike
and
the
same
might
be
said
of
the
powders
so
that
i
was
never
troubled
by
those
absurd
investigations
into
the
nature
of
remedies
which
some
patients
are
prone
to
make
of
course
i
desired
to
get
business
and
it
was
therefore
obviously
unwise
to
give
little
pills
of
or
or
when
a
man
needed
a
dose
of
oil
or
a
girl
iron
or
the
like
i
soon
made
the
useful
discovery
that
it
was
only
necessary
to
prescribe
oil
for
instance
as
a
diet
in
order
to
make
use
of
it
where
required
when
a
man
got
impatient
over
an
ancient
ague
i
usually
found
too
that
i
could
persuade
him
to
let
me
try
a
good
dose
of
quinine
while
on
the
other
hand
there
was
a
distinct
pecuniary
advantage
in
those
cases
of
the
shakes
which
could
be
made
to
believe
that
it
was
best
not
to
interfere
with
i
ought
to
add
that
this
kind
of
faith
is
uncommon
among
folks
who
carry
hods
or
build
walls
for
women
who
are
hysterical
and
go
heart
and
soul
into
the
business
of
being
sick
i
have
found
the
little
pills
a
most
charming
resort
because
you
can
not
carry
the
refinement
of
symptoms
beyond
what
my
friend
jahr
has
done
in
the
way
of
fitting
medicines
to
them
so
that
if
i
had
taken
seriously
to
practising
this
double
form
of
therapeutics
it
had
as
i
saw
certain
conveniences
another
year
went
by
and
i
was
beginning
to
prosper
in
my
new
mode
of
life
my
medicines
being
chiefly
with
variations
as
to
the
labels
cost
next
to
nothing
and
as
i
charged
pretty
well
for
both
these
and
my
advice
i
was
now
able
to
start
a
gig
i
solemnly
believe
that
i
should
have
continued
to
succeed
in
the
practice
of
my
profession
if
it
had
not
happened
that
fate
was
once
more
unkind
to
me
by
throwing
in
my
path
one
of
my
old
acquaintances
i
had
a
consultation
one
day
with
the
famous
homeopath
zwanzig
as
we
walked
away
we
were
busily
discussing
the
case
of
a
poor
consumptive
fellow
who
previously
had
lost
a
leg
in
consequence
of
this
defect
zwanzig
considered
that
the
of
a
grain
of
aurum
would
be
an
overdose
and
that
it
must
be
fractioned
so
as
to
allow
for
the
departed
leg
otherwise
the
rest
of
the
man
would
be
getting
a
too
much
i
was
particularly
struck
with
this
view
of
the
case
but
i
was
still
more
and
less
pleasingly
impressed
at
the
sight
of
my
former
patient
stagers
who
nodded
to
me
familiarly
from
the
opposite
pavement
i
was
not
at
all
surprised
when
that
evening
quite
late
i
found
this
worthy
waiting
in
my
office
i
looked
around
uneasily
which
was
clearly
understood
by
my
friend
who
retorted
ain
t
took
nothin
of
yours
doc
you
don
t
seem
right
awful
glad
to
see
me
you
needn
t
be
afraid
i
ve
only
fetched
you
a
job
and
a
right
good
one
i
replied
that
i
had
my
regular
business
that
i
preferred
he
should
get
some
one
else
and
pretty
generally
made
stagers
aware
that
i
had
had
enough
of
him
i
did
not
ask
him
to
sit
down
and
just
as
i
supposed
him
about
to
leave
he
seated
himself
with
a
grin
remarking
no
use
doc
got
to
go
into
it
this
one
at
this
i
naturally
enough
grew
angry
and
used
several
rather
violent
phrases
no
use
doc
said
stagers
then
i
softened
down
and
laughed
a
little
and
treated
the
thing
as
a
joke
whatever
it
was
for
i
dreaded
to
hear
but
stagers
was
fate
stagers
was
inevitable
won
t
do
doc
not
even
money
wouldn
t
get
you
no
said
i
interrogatively
and
as
coolly
as
i
could
contriving
at
the
same
time
to
move
toward
the
window
it
was
summer
the
sashes
were
up
the
shutters
half
drawn
in
and
a
policeman
whom
i
knew
was
lounging
opposite
as
i
had
noticed
when
i
entered
i
would
give
stagers
a
scare
charge
him
with
theft
anything
but
get
mixed
up
with
his
kind
again
it
was
the
folly
of
a
moment
and
i
should
have
paid
dear
for
it
he
must
have
understood
me
the
scoundrel
for
in
an
instant
i
felt
a
cold
ring
of
steel
against
my
ear
and
a
tiger
clutch
on
my
cravat
sit
down
he
said
what
a
fool
you
are
guess
you
forgot
that
there
coroner
s
business
and
the
needless
to
say
that
i
obeyed
best
not
try
that
again
continued
my
guest
wait
a
moment
and
rising
he
closed
the
window
there
was
no
resource
left
but
to
listen
and
what
followed
i
shall
condense
rather
than
relate
it
in
the
language
employed
by
stagers
it
appeared
that
my
other
acquaintance
mr
file
had
been
guilty
of
a
and
murder
for
which
he
had
been
tried
and
convicted
he
now
lay
in
jail
awaiting
his
execution
which
was
to
take
place
at
carsonville
ohio
it
seemed
that
with
stagers
and
others
he
had
formed
a
band
of
expert
counterfeiters
in
the
west
their
business
lay
in
the
manufacture
of
south
american
currencies
file
had
thus
acquired
a
fortune
so
considerable
that
i
was
amazed
at
his
having
allowed
his
passion
to
seduce
him
into
unprofitable
crime
in
his
agony
he
unfortunately
thought
of
me
and
had
bribed
stagers
largely
in
order
that
he
might
be
induced
to
find
me
when
the
narration
had
reached
this
stage
and
i
had
been
made
fully
to
understand
that
i
was
now
and
hereafter
under
the
sharp
eye
of
stagers
and
his
friends
that
in
a
word
escape
was
out
of
the
question
i
turned
on
my
tormentor
what
does
all
this
mean
i
said
what
does
file
expect
me
to
do
don
t
believe
he
exactly
knows
said
stagers
something
or
other
to
get
him
clear
of
but
what
stuff
i
replied
how
can
i
help
him
what
possible
influence
could
i
exert
can
t
say
answered
stagers
imperturbably
file
has
a
notion
you
re
most
cunning
enough
for
anything
best
try
something
and
what
if
i
won
t
do
it
said
i
what
does
it
matter
to
me
if
the
rascal
swings
or
no
keep
cool
doc
returned
stagers
i
m
only
agent
in
this
here
business
my
principal
that
s
file
he
says
tell
sanderaft
to
find
some
way
to
get
me
clear
once
out
i
give
him
ten
thousand
dollars
if
he
don
t
turn
up
something
that
will
suit
i
ll
blow
about
that
coroner
business
and
lou
wilson
and
break
him
up
you
don
t
mean
said
i
in
a
cold
sweat
you
don
t
mean
that
if
i
can
t
do
this
impossible
thing
he
will
inform
on
me
just
so
returned
stagers
got
a
cigar
doc
i
only
half
heard
him
what
a
frightful
position
i
had
been
leading
a
happy
and
an
increasingly
profitable
life
no
scrapes
and
no
dangers
and
here
on
a
sudden
i
had
presented
to
me
the
alternative
of
saving
a
wretch
from
the
gallows
or
of
spending
unlimited
years
in
a
state
penitentiary
as
for
the
money
it
became
as
dead
leaves
for
this
once
only
in
my
life
my
brain
seemed
to
be
spinning
round
i
grew
weak
all
over
cheer
up
a
little
said
stagers
take
a
nip
of
whisky
things
ain
t
at
the
worst
by
a
good
bit
you
just
get
ready
and
we
ll
start
by
the
morning
train
guess
you
ll
try
out
something
smart
enough
as
we
travel
along
ain
t
got
a
heap
of
time
to
i
was
silent
a
great
anguish
had
me
in
its
grip
i
might
squirm
as
i
would
it
was
all
in
vain
hideous
plans
rose
to
my
mind
born
of
this
agony
of
terror
i
might
murder
stagers
but
what
good
would
that
do
as
to
file
he
was
safe
from
my
hand
at
last
i
became
too
confused
to
think
any
longer
when
do
we
leave
i
said
feebly
at
six
he
returned
how
i
was
watched
and
guarded
and
how
hurried
over
a
thousand
miles
of
rail
to
my
fate
little
concerns
us
now
i
find
it
dreadful
to
recall
it
to
memory
above
all
an
aching
eagerness
for
revenge
upon
the
man
who
had
caused
me
these
sufferings
was
uppermost
in
my
mind
could
i
not
fool
the
wretch
and
save
myself
of
a
sudden
an
idea
came
into
my
consciousness
then
it
grew
and
formed
itself
became
possible
probable
seemed
to
me
sure
ah
said
i
stagers
give
me
something
to
eat
and
i
had
not
tasted
food
for
two
days
within
a
day
or
two
after
my
arrival
i
was
enabled
to
see
file
in
his
cell
on
the
plea
of
being
a
clergyman
from
his
native
place
i
found
that
i
had
not
miscalculated
my
danger
the
man
did
not
appear
to
have
the
least
idea
as
to
how
i
was
to
help
him
he
only
knew
that
i
was
in
his
power
and
he
used
his
control
to
insure
that
something
more
potent
than
friendship
should
be
enlisted
in
his
behalf
as
the
days
went
by
his
behavior
grew
to
be
a
frightful
thing
to
witness
he
threatened
flattered
implored
offered
to
double
the
sum
he
had
promised
if
i
would
save
him
my
really
reasonable
first
thought
was
to
see
the
governor
of
the
state
and
as
stagers
s
former
physician
make
oath
to
his
having
had
many
attacks
of
epilepsy
followed
by
brief
periods
of
homicidal
mania
he
had
in
fact
had
fits
of
alcoholic
epilepsy
unluckily
the
governor
was
in
a
distant
city
the
time
was
short
and
the
case
against
my
man
too
clear
stagers
said
it
would
not
do
i
was
at
my
wit
s
end
got
to
do
something
said
file
or
i
ll
attend
to
your
case
but
said
i
suppose
there
is
really
nothing
well
said
stagers
to
me
when
we
were
alone
you
get
him
satisfied
anyhow
he
ll
never
let
them
hang
him
and
perhaps
well
i
m
going
to
give
him
these
pills
when
i
get
a
chance
he
asked
to
have
them
but
what
s
your
other
plan
stagers
knew
as
much
about
medicine
as
a
pig
knows
about
the
opera
so
i
set
to
work
to
delude
him
first
asking
if
he
could
secure
me
as
a
clergyman
an
hour
alone
with
file
just
before
the
execution
he
said
money
would
do
it
and
what
was
my
plan
well
said
i
there
was
once
a
man
named
chovet
he
lived
in
london
a
gentleman
who
turned
highwayman
was
to
be
hanged
you
see
said
i
this
was
about
well
his
friends
bribed
the
jailer
and
the
hangman
the
doctor
cut
a
hole
in
the
man
s
windpipe
very
low
down
where
it
could
be
partly
hid
by
a
loose
cravat
so
as
they
hanged
him
only
a
little
while
and
the
breath
went
in
and
out
of
the
opening
below
the
noose
he
was
only
just
insensible
when
his
friends
got
him
and
he
got
well
cried
stagers
much
pleased
with
my
rather
melodramatic
tale
yes
i
said
he
got
well
and
lived
to
take
purses
all
dressed
in
white
people
had
known
him
well
and
when
he
robbed
his
who
was
not
in
the
secret
she
swore
she
had
seen
his
stagers
said
that
was
a
fine
story
guessed
it
would
work
small
town
new
business
lots
of
money
to
use
in
fact
the
attempt
thus
to
save
a
man
is
said
to
have
been
made
but
by
ill
luck
the
man
did
not
recover
it
answered
my
purpose
but
how
any
one
even
such
an
ass
as
this
fellow
could
believe
it
could
succeed
puzzles
me
to
this
day
file
became
enthusiastic
over
my
scheme
and
i
cordially
assisted
his
credulity
the
thing
was
to
keep
the
wretch
quiet
until
the
business
blew
up
or
and
i
shuddered
until
file
in
despair
took
his
pill
i
should
in
any
case
find
it
wise
to
leave
in
haste
my
friend
stagers
had
some
absurd
misgivings
lest
file
s
neck
might
be
broken
by
the
fall
but
as
to
this
i
was
able
to
reassure
him
upon
the
best
scientific
authority
there
were
certain
other
and
minor
questions
as
to
the
effect
of
sudden
nearly
complete
arrest
of
the
supply
of
blood
to
the
brain
but
with
these
physiological
refinements
i
thought
it
needlessly
cruel
to
distract
a
man
in
file
s
peculiar
position
perhaps
i
shall
be
doing
injustice
to
my
own
intellect
if
i
do
not
hasten
to
state
again
that
i
had
not
the
remotest
belief
in
the
efficacy
of
my
plan
for
any
purpose
except
to
get
me
out
of
a
very
uncomfortable
position
and
give
me
with
time
a
chance
to
escape
stagers
and
i
were
both
disguised
as
clergymen
and
were
quite
freely
admitted
to
the
condemned
man
s
cell
in
fact
there
was
in
the
little
town
a
certain
trustful
simplicity
about
all
their
arrangements
the
day
but
one
before
the
execution
stagers
informed
me
that
file
had
the
pills
which
he
stagers
had
contrived
to
give
him
stagers
seemed
pleased
with
our
plan
i
was
not
he
was
really
getting
uneasy
and
suspicious
of
me
as
i
was
soon
to
find
out
so
far
our
plans
or
rather
mine
had
worked
to
a
marvel
certain
of
file
s
old
accomplices
succeeded
in
bribing
the
hangman
to
shorten
the
time
of
suspension
arrangements
were
made
to
secure
me
two
hours
alone
with
the
prisoner
so
that
nothing
seemed
to
be
wanting
to
this
tomfool
business
i
had
assured
stagers
that
i
would
not
need
to
see
file
again
previous
to
the
operation
but
in
the
forenoon
of
the
day
before
that
set
for
the
execution
i
was
seized
with
a
feverish
impatience
which
luckily
prompted
me
to
visit
him
once
more
as
usual
i
was
admitted
readily
and
nearly
reached
his
cell
when
i
became
aware
from
the
sound
of
voices
heard
through
the
grating
in
the
door
that
there
was
a
visitor
in
the
cell
who
is
with
him
i
inquired
of
the
turnkey
the
doctor
he
replied
doctor
i
said
pausing
what
doctor
oh
the
jail
doctor
i
was
to
come
back
in
half
an
hour
to
let
him
out
but
he
s
got
a
quarter
to
stay
shall
i
let
you
in
or
will
you
wait
no
i
replied
it
is
hardly
right
to
interrupt
them
i
will
walk
in
the
corridor
for
ten
minutes
or
so
and
then
you
can
come
back
to
let
me
into
the
very
good
he
returned
and
left
me
as
soon
as
i
was
alone
i
cautiously
advanced
until
i
stood
alongside
of
the
door
through
the
barred
grating
of
which
i
was
able
readily
to
hear
what
went
on
within
the
first
words
i
caught
were
these
and
you
tell
me
doctor
that
even
if
a
man
s
windpipe
was
open
the
hanging
would
kill
him
are
you
sure
yes
i
believe
there
would
be
no
doubt
of
it
i
can
not
see
how
escape
would
be
possible
but
let
me
ask
you
why
you
have
sent
for
me
to
ask
these
singular
questions
you
can
not
have
the
faintest
hope
of
escape
and
least
of
all
in
such
a
manner
as
this
i
advise
you
to
think
about
the
fate
which
is
inevitable
you
must
i
fear
have
much
to
reflect
but
said
file
if
i
wanted
to
try
this
plan
of
mine
couldn
t
some
one
be
found
to
help
me
say
if
he
was
to
make
twenty
thousand
or
so
by
it
i
mean
a
really
good
evidently
file
cruelly
mistrusted
my
skill
and
meant
to
get
some
one
to
aid
me
if
you
mean
me
answered
the
doctor
some
one
can
not
be
found
neither
for
twenty
nor
fifty
thousand
dollars
besides
if
any
one
were
wicked
enough
to
venture
on
such
an
attempt
he
would
only
be
deceiving
you
with
a
hope
which
would
be
utterly
vain
you
must
be
off
your
i
understood
all
this
with
an
increasing
fear
in
my
mind
i
had
meant
to
get
away
that
night
at
all
risks
i
saw
now
that
i
must
go
at
once
after
a
pause
he
said
well
doctor
you
know
a
poor
devil
in
my
fix
will
clutch
at
straws
hope
i
have
not
offended
not
in
the
least
returned
the
doctor
shall
i
send
you
smith
this
was
my
present
name
in
fact
i
was
known
as
the
rev
eliphalet
smith
i
would
like
it
answered
file
but
as
you
go
out
tell
the
warden
i
want
to
see
him
immediately
about
a
matter
of
great
at
this
stage
i
began
to
apprehend
very
distinctly
that
the
time
had
arrived
when
it
would
be
wiser
for
me
to
delay
escape
no
longer
accordingly
i
waited
until
i
heard
the
doctor
rise
and
at
once
stepped
quietly
away
to
the
far
end
of
the
corridor
i
had
scarcely
reached
it
when
the
door
which
closed
it
was
opened
by
a
turnkey
who
had
come
to
relieve
the
doctor
and
let
me
into
the
cell
of
course
my
peril
was
imminent
if
the
turnkey
mentioned
my
near
presence
to
the
prisoner
immediate
disclosure
would
follow
if
some
lapse
of
time
were
secured
before
the
warden
obeyed
the
request
from
file
that
he
should
visit
him
i
might
gain
thus
a
hour
but
hardly
more
i
therefore
said
to
the
officer
tell
the
warden
that
the
doctor
wishes
to
remain
an
hour
longer
with
the
prisoner
and
that
i
shall
return
myself
at
the
end
of
that
very
good
sir
said
the
turnkey
allowing
me
to
pass
out
and
as
he
followed
me
relocking
the
door
of
the
corridor
i
ll
tell
him
he
said
it
is
needless
to
repeat
that
i
never
had
the
least
idea
of
carrying
out
the
ridiculous
scheme
with
which
i
had
deluded
file
and
stagers
but
so
far
stagers
s
watchfulness
had
given
me
no
chance
to
escape
in
a
few
moments
i
was
outside
of
the
jail
gate
and
saw
my
stagers
in
full
broadcloth
and
white
tie
coming
down
the
street
toward
me
as
usual
he
was
on
his
guard
but
this
time
he
had
to
deal
with
a
man
grown
perfectly
desperate
with
everything
to
win
and
nothing
to
lose
my
plans
were
made
and
wild
as
they
were
i
thought
them
worth
the
trying
i
must
evade
this
man
s
terrible
watch
how
keen
it
was
you
can
not
imagine
but
it
was
aided
by
three
of
the
infamous
gang
to
which
file
had
belonged
for
without
these
spies
no
one
person
could
possibly
have
sustained
so
perfect
a
system
i
took
stagers
s
arm
what
time
said
i
does
the
first
train
start
for
dayton
at
twelve
what
do
you
want
how
far
is
it
about
fifteen
miles
he
replied
good
i
can
get
back
by
eight
o
clock
easily
said
stagers
if
you
go
what
do
you
want
i
want
a
smaller
tube
to
put
in
the
windpipe
must
have
it
in
well
i
don
t
like
it
said
he
but
the
thing
s
got
to
go
through
somehow
if
you
must
go
i
will
go
along
myself
can
t
lose
sight
of
you
doc
just
at
present
you
re
monstrous
precious
did
you
tell
file
yes
said
i
he
s
all
right
come
we
ve
no
time
to
nor
had
we
within
twenty
minutes
we
were
seated
in
the
last
car
of
a
long
train
and
running
at
the
rate
of
twenty
miles
an
hour
toward
dayton
in
about
ten
minutes
i
asked
stagers
for
a
cigar
can
t
smoke
here
said
he
no
i
answered
of
course
not
i
ll
go
forward
into
the
come
along
said
he
and
we
went
through
the
train
i
was
not
sorry
he
had
gone
with
me
when
i
found
in
the
one
of
the
spies
who
had
been
watching
me
so
constantly
stagers
nodded
to
him
and
grinned
at
me
and
we
sat
down
together
chut
said
i
left
my
cigar
on
the
in
the
hindmost
car
be
back
in
a
this
time
for
a
wonder
stagers
allowed
me
to
leave
unaccompanied
i
hastened
through
to
the
nearer
end
of
the
hindmost
car
and
stood
on
the
platform
i
instantly
cut
the
then
i
knelt
down
and
waiting
until
the
two
cars
ran
together
i
tugged
at
the
as
the
cars
came
together
i
could
lift
it
a
little
then
as
the
strain
came
on
the
coupling
the
pin
held
fast
at
last
i
made
a
great
effort
and
out
it
came
the
car
i
was
on
instantly
lost
speed
and
there
on
the
other
platform
a
hundred
feet
away
was
stagers
shaking
his
fist
at
me
he
was
beaten
and
he
knew
it
in
the
end
few
people
have
been
able
to
get
ahead
of
me
the
retreating
train
was
half
a
mile
away
around
the
curve
as
i
screwed
up
the
brake
on
my
car
hard
enough
to
bring
it
nearly
to
a
stand
i
did
not
wait
for
it
to
stop
entirely
before
i
slipped
off
the
steps
leaving
the
other
passengers
to
dispose
of
themselves
as
they
might
until
their
absence
should
be
discovered
and
the
rest
of
the
train
return
as
i
wish
rather
to
illustrate
my
very
remarkable
professional
career
than
to
amuse
by
describing
its
lesser
incidents
i
shall
not
linger
to
tell
how
i
succeeded
at
last
in
reaching
louis
fortunately
i
had
never
ceased
to
anticipate
the
moment
when
escape
from
file
and
his
friends
would
be
possible
so
that
i
always
carried
about
with
me
the
very
small
funds
with
which
i
had
hastily
provided
myself
upon
leaving
the
whole
amount
did
not
exceed
dollars
but
with
this
and
a
gold
watch
worth
twice
as
much
i
hoped
to
be
able
to
subsist
until
my
own
ingenuity
enabled
me
to
provide
more
liberally
for
the
future
naturally
enough
i
scanned
the
papers
closely
to
discover
some
account
of
file
s
death
and
of
the
disclosures
concerning
myself
which
he
was
only
too
likely
to
have
made
i
came
at
last
on
an
account
of
how
he
had
poisoned
himself
and
so
escaped
the
hangman
i
never
learned
what
he
had
said
about
me
but
i
was
quite
sure
he
had
not
let
me
off
easy
i
felt
that
this
failure
to
announce
his
confessions
was
probably
due
to
a
desire
on
the
part
of
the
police
to
avoid
alarming
me
be
this
as
it
may
i
remained
long
ignorant
as
to
whether
or
not
the
villain
betrayed
my
part
in
that
unusual
coroner
s
inquest
before
many
days
i
had
resolved
to
make
another
and
a
bold
venture
accordingly
appeared
in
the
louis
papers
an
advertisement
to
the
effect
that
von
ingenhoff
the
german
physician
who
had
spent
two
years
on
the
plains
acquiring
a
knowledge
of
indian
medicine
was
prepared
to
treat
all
diseases
by
vegetable
remedies
alone
von
ingenhoff
would
remain
in
louis
for
two
weeks
and
was
to
be
found
at
the
grayson
house
every
day
from
ten
until
two
o
clock
to
my
delight
i
got
two
patients
the
first
day
the
next
i
had
twice
as
many
when
at
once
i
hired
two
connecting
rooms
and
made
a
very
useful
arrangement
which
i
may
describe
dramatically
in
the
following
way
there
being
two
or
three
patients
waiting
while
i
finished
my
cigar
and
morning
julep
enters
a
old
gentleman
who
inquires
briskly
of
the
patients
if
this
is
really
von
ingenhoff
s
he
is
told
it
is
my
friend
was
apt
to
overact
his
part
i
had
often
occasion
to
ask
him
to
be
less
positive
ah
says
he
i
shall
be
delighted
to
see
the
doctor
five
years
ago
i
was
scalped
on
the
plains
and
now
exhibiting
a
head
you
see
what
the
doctor
did
for
me
t
isn
t
any
wonder
i
ve
come
fifty
miles
to
see
him
any
of
you
been
scalped
gentlemen
to
none
of
them
had
this
misfortune
arrived
as
yet
but
like
most
folks
in
the
lower
ranks
of
life
and
some
in
the
upper
ones
it
was
pleasant
to
find
a
genial
person
who
would
listen
to
their
account
of
their
own
symptoms
presently
after
hearing
enough
the
old
gentleman
pulls
out
a
large
watch
bless
me
it
s
late
i
must
call
again
may
i
trouble
you
sir
to
say
to
the
doctor
that
his
old
friend
called
to
see
him
and
will
drop
in
again
don
t
forget
governor
brown
of
a
moment
later
the
governor
visited
me
by
a
side
door
with
his
account
of
the
symptoms
of
my
patients
enter
a
tall
hoosier
the
governor
having
retired
now
doc
says
the
hoosier
i
ve
been
handled
awful
these
two
years
stop
i
exclaimed
open
your
eyes
there
now
let
me
see
taking
his
pulse
as
i
speak
ah
you
ve
a
pain
there
and
there
and
you
can
t
sleep
cocktails
don
t
agree
any
longer
weren
t
you
bit
by
a
dog
two
years
ago
i
was
says
the
hoosier
in
amazement
sir
i
reply
you
have
chronic
hydrophobia
it
s
the
water
in
the
cocktails
that
disagrees
with
you
my
bitters
will
cure
you
in
a
week
sir
no
more
whisky
drink
the
astonishment
of
my
patient
at
these
accurate
revelations
may
be
imagined
he
is
allowed
to
wait
for
his
medicine
in
the
anteroom
where
the
chances
are
in
favor
of
his
relating
how
wonderfully
i
had
told
all
his
symptoms
at
a
glance
governor
brown
of
arkansas
was
a
small
but
clever
actor
whom
i
met
in
the
and
who
day
after
day
in
varying
disguises
and
modes
played
off
the
same
tricks
to
our
great
common
advantage
at
my
friend
s
suggestion
we
very
soon
added
to
our
resources
by
the
purchase
of
two
electromagnetic
batteries
this
special
means
of
treating
all
classes
of
maladies
has
advantages
which
are
altogether
peculiar
in
the
first
place
you
instruct
your
patient
that
the
treatment
is
of
necessity
a
long
one
a
striking
mode
of
putting
it
is
to
say
sir
you
have
been
six
months
getting
ill
it
will
require
six
months
for
a
there
is
a
correct
sound
about
such
a
phrase
and
it
is
sure
to
satisfy
two
sittings
a
week
at
two
dollars
a
sitting
will
pay
in
many
cases
the
patient
gets
well
while
you
are
electrifying
him
whether
or
not
the
electricity
cured
him
is
a
thing
i
shall
never
know
if
however
he
began
to
show
signs
of
impatience
i
advised
him
that
he
would
require
a
year
s
treatment
and
suggested
that
it
would
be
economical
for
him
to
buy
a
battery
and
use
it
at
home
thus
advised
he
pays
you
twenty
dollars
for
an
instrument
which
cost
you
ten
and
you
are
rid
of
a
troublesome
case
if
the
reader
has
followed
me
closely
he
will
have
learned
that
i
am
a
man
of
large
and
liberal
views
in
my
profession
and
of
a
very
justifiable
ambition
the
idea
has
often
occurred
to
me
of
combining
in
one
establishment
all
the
various
modes
of
practice
which
are
known
as
irregular
this
as
will
be
understood
is
really
only
a
wider
application
of
the
idea
which
prompted
me
to
unite
in
my
own
business
homeopathy
and
the
practice
of
medicine
i
proposed
to
my
partner
accordingly
to
combine
with
our
present
business
that
of
spiritualism
which
i
knew
had
been
very
profitably
turned
to
account
in
connection
with
medical
practice
as
soon
as
he
agreed
to
this
plan
which
by
the
way
i
hoped
to
enlarge
so
as
to
include
all
the
available
isms
i
set
about
making
such
preparations
as
were
necessary
i
remembered
having
read
somewhere
that
a
schiff
had
shown
that
he
could
produce
remarkable
knockings
so
called
by
voluntarily
dislocating
the
great
toe
and
then
forcibly
drawing
it
back
into
its
socket
a
still
better
noise
could
be
made
by
throwing
the
tendon
of
the
peroneus
longus
muscle
out
of
the
hollow
in
which
it
lies
alongside
of
the
ankle
after
some
effort
i
was
able
to
accomplish
both
feats
quite
readily
and
could
occasion
a
remarkable
variety
of
sounds
according
to
the
power
which
i
employed
or
the
positions
which
i
occupied
at
the
time
as
to
all
other
matters
i
trusted
to
the
suggestions
of
my
own
ingenuity
which
as
a
rule
has
rarely
failed
me
the
largest
success
attended
the
novel
plan
which
my
lucky
genius
had
devised
so
that
soon
we
actually
began
to
divide
large
profits
and
to
lay
by
a
portion
of
our
savings
it
is
of
course
not
to
be
supposed
that
this
desirable
result
was
attained
without
many
annoyances
and
some
positive
danger
my
spiritual
revelations
medical
and
other
were
as
may
be
supposed
only
more
or
less
happy
guesses
but
in
this
as
in
predictions
as
to
the
weather
and
other
events
the
rare
successes
always
get
more
prominence
in
the
minds
of
men
than
the
numerous
failures
moreover
whenever
a
person
has
been
fool
enough
to
resort
to
folks
like
myself
he
is
always
glad
to
be
able
to
defend
his
conduct
by
bringing
forward
every
possible
proof
of
skill
on
the
part
of
the
men
he
has
consulted
these
considerations
and
a
certain
love
of
mysterious
or
unusual
means
i
have
commonly
found
sufficient
to
secure
an
ample
share
of
gullible
individuals
i
may
add
too
that
those
who
would
be
shrewd
enough
to
understand
and
expose
us
are
wise
enough
to
keep
away
altogether
such
as
did
come
were
as
a
rule
easy
enough
to
manage
but
now
and
then
we
hit
upon
some
utterly
exceptional
patient
who
was
both
foolish
enough
to
consult
us
and
sharp
enough
to
know
he
had
been
swindled
when
such
a
fellow
made
a
fuss
it
was
occasionally
necessary
to
return
his
money
if
it
was
found
impossible
to
bully
him
into
silence
in
one
or
two
instances
where
i
had
promised
a
cure
upon
prepayment
of
two
or
three
hundred
dollars
i
was
either
sued
or
threatened
with
suit
and
had
to
refund
a
part
or
the
whole
of
the
amount
but
most
people
preferred
to
hold
their
tongues
rather
than
expose
to
the
world
the
extent
of
their
own
folly
in
one
most
disastrous
case
i
suffered
personally
to
a
degree
which
i
never
can
recall
without
a
distinct
sense
of
annoyance
both
at
my
own
want
of
care
and
at
the
disgusting
consequences
which
it
brought
upon
me
early
one
morning
an
old
gentleman
called
in
a
state
of
the
utmost
agitation
and
explained
that
he
desired
to
consult
the
spirits
as
to
a
heavy
loss
which
he
had
experienced
the
night
before
he
had
left
he
said
a
sum
of
money
in
his
pantaloons
pocket
upon
going
to
bed
in
the
morning
he
had
changed
his
clothes
and
gone
out
forgetting
to
remove
the
notes
returning
in
an
hour
in
great
haste
he
discovered
that
the
garment
still
lay
upon
the
chair
where
he
had
thrown
it
but
that
the
money
was
missing
i
at
once
desired
him
to
be
seated
and
proceeded
to
ask
him
certain
questions
in
a
chatty
way
about
the
habits
of
his
household
the
amount
lost
and
the
like
expecting
thus
to
get
some
clue
which
would
enable
me
to
make
my
spirits
display
the
requisite
share
of
sagacity
in
pointing
out
the
thief
i
learned
readily
that
he
was
an
old
and
wealthy
man
a
little
close
too
i
suspected
and
that
he
lived
in
a
large
house
with
but
two
servants
and
an
only
son
about
years
old
the
servants
were
both
women
who
had
lived
in
the
household
many
years
and
were
probably
innocent
unluckily
remembering
my
own
youthful
career
i
presently
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
young
man
had
been
the
delinquent
when
i
ventured
to
inquire
a
little
as
to
his
habits
the
old
gentleman
cut
me
very
short
remarking
that
he
came
to
ask
questions
and
not
to
be
questioned
and
that
he
desired
at
once
to
consult
the
spirits
upon
this
i
sat
down
at
a
table
and
after
a
brief
silence
demanded
in
a
solemn
voice
if
there
were
any
spirits
present
by
industriously
cracking
my
big
i
was
enabled
to
represent
at
once
the
presence
of
a
numerous
assembly
of
these
worthies
then
i
inquired
if
any
one
of
them
had
been
present
when
the
robbery
was
effected
a
prompt
double
knock
replied
in
the
affirmative
i
may
say
here
by
the
way
that
the
unanimity
of
the
spirits
as
to
their
use
of
two
knocks
for
yes
and
one
for
no
is
a
very
remarkable
point
and
shows
if
it
shows
anything
how
perfect
and
universal
must
be
the
social
intercourse
of
the
respected
departed
it
is
worthy
of
note
also
that
if
the
spirit
i
will
not
say
the
medium
perceives
after
one
knock
that
it
were
wiser
to
say
yes
he
can
conveniently
add
the
second
tap
some
such
arrangement
in
real
life
would
it
appears
to
me
be
highly
desirable
it
seemed
that
the
spirit
was
that
of
vidocq
the
french
detective
i
had
just
read
a
translation
of
his
memoirs
and
he
seemed
to
me
a
very
available
spirit
to
call
upon
as
soon
as
i
explained
that
the
spirit
who
answered
had
been
a
witness
of
the
theft
the
old
man
became
strangely
agitated
who
was
it
said
he
at
once
the
spirit
indicated
a
desire
to
use
the
alphabet
as
we
went
over
the
letters
always
a
slow
method
but
useful
when
you
want
to
observe
excitable
people
my
visitor
kept
saying
quicker
go
at
length
the
spirit
spelled
out
the
words
i
know
not
his
was
it
said
the
gentleman
was
it
a
was
it
one
of
my
household
i
knocked
yes
without
hesitation
who
else
indeed
could
it
have
been
excuse
me
he
went
on
if
i
ask
you
for
a
little
this
i
gave
him
he
continued
was
it
susan
or
ellen
no
no
was
it
he
paused
if
i
ask
a
question
mentally
will
the
spirits
reply
i
knew
what
he
meant
he
wanted
to
ask
if
it
was
his
son
but
did
not
wish
to
speak
openly
ask
said
i
i
have
he
returned
i
hesitated
it
was
rarely
my
policy
to
commit
myself
definitely
yet
here
i
fancied
from
the
facts
of
the
case
and
his
own
terrible
anxiety
that
he
suspected
or
more
than
suspected
his
son
as
the
guilty
person
i
became
sure
of
this
as
i
studied
his
face
at
all
events
it
would
be
easy
to
deny
or
explain
in
case
of
trouble
and
after
all
what
slander
was
there
in
two
knocks
i
struck
twice
as
usual
instantly
the
old
gentleman
rose
up
very
white
but
quite
firm
there
he
said
and
cast
a
on
the
table
i
thank
you
and
bending
his
head
on
his
breast
walked
as
i
thought
with
great
effort
out
of
the
room
on
the
following
morning
as
i
made
my
first
appearance
in
my
outer
room
which
contained
at
least
a
dozen
persons
awaiting
advice
who
should
i
see
standing
by
the
window
but
the
old
gentleman
with
hair
along
with
him
was
a
stout
young
man
with
a
head
as
red
as
mine
and
mustache
and
whiskers
to
match
probably
the
son
i
thought
ardent
temperament
remorse
come
to
confess
etc
i
was
never
more
mistaken
in
my
life
i
was
about
to
go
regularly
through
my
patients
when
the
old
gentleman
began
to
speak
i
called
doctor
said
he
to
explain
the
little
matter
about
which
i
about
which
i
troubled
your
spirits
yesterday
added
the
youth
jocosely
pulling
his
mustache
beg
pardon
i
returned
had
we
not
better
talk
this
over
in
private
come
into
my
office
i
added
touching
the
younger
man
on
the
arm
would
you
believe
it
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
dusted
the
place
i
had
touched
better
not
said
he
go
on
father
let
us
get
done
with
this
gentlemen
said
the
elder
person
addressing
the
patients
i
called
here
yesterday
like
a
fool
to
ask
who
had
stolen
from
me
a
sum
of
money
which
i
believed
i
left
in
my
room
on
going
out
in
the
morning
this
doctor
here
and
his
spirits
contrived
to
make
me
suspect
my
only
son
well
i
charged
him
at
once
with
the
crime
as
soon
as
i
got
back
home
and
what
do
you
think
he
did
he
said
father
let
us
go
and
look
for
it
and
here
the
young
man
broke
in
with
come
father
don
t
worry
yourself
for
nothing
and
then
turning
added
to
cut
the
thing
short
he
found
the
notes
under
his
where
he
left
them
on
going
to
bed
this
is
all
of
it
we
came
here
to
stop
this
fellow
by
which
he
meant
me
from
carrying
a
slander
further
i
advise
you
good
people
to
profit
by
the
matter
and
to
look
up
a
more
honest
doctor
if
doctoring
be
what
you
as
soon
as
he
had
ended
i
remarked
solemnly
the
words
of
the
spirits
are
not
my
words
who
shall
hold
them
accountable
nonsense
said
the
young
man
come
father
and
they
left
the
room
now
was
the
time
to
retrieve
my
character
gentlemen
said
i
you
have
heard
this
very
singular
account
trusting
the
spirits
utterly
and
entirely
as
i
do
it
occurs
to
me
that
there
is
no
reason
why
they
may
not
after
all
have
been
right
in
their
suspicions
of
this
young
person
who
can
say
that
overcome
by
remorse
he
may
not
have
seized
the
time
of
his
father
s
absence
to
replace
the
money
to
my
amazement
up
gets
a
little
old
man
from
the
corner
well
you
are
a
low
cuss
said
he
and
taking
up
a
basket
beside
him
hobbled
hastily
out
of
the
room
you
may
be
sure
i
said
some
pretty
sharp
things
to
him
for
i
was
out
of
humor
to
begin
with
and
it
is
one
thing
to
be
insulted
by
a
stout
young
man
and
quite
another
to
be
abused
by
a
wretched
old
cripple
however
he
went
away
and
i
supposed
for
my
part
that
i
was
done
with
the
whole
business
an
hour
later
however
i
heard
a
rough
knock
at
my
door
and
opening
it
hastily
saw
my
young
man
with
the
cripple
now
said
the
former
taking
me
by
the
collar
and
pulling
me
into
the
room
among
my
patients
i
want
to
know
my
man
if
this
doctor
said
that
it
was
likely
i
was
the
thief
after
all
that
s
what
he
said
replied
the
cripple
just
about
that
i
do
not
desire
to
dwell
on
the
after
conduct
of
this
young
man
it
was
the
more
disgraceful
as
i
offered
but
little
resistance
and
endured
a
beating
such
as
i
would
have
hesitated
to
inflict
upon
a
dog
nor
was
this
all
he
warned
me
that
if
i
dared
to
remain
in
the
city
after
a
week
he
would
shoot
me
in
the
east
i
should
have
thought
but
little
of
such
a
threat
but
here
it
was
only
too
likely
to
be
practically
carried
out
accordingly
with
my
usual
decision
of
character
but
with
much
grief
and
reluctance
i
collected
my
whole
fortune
which
now
amounted
to
at
least
seven
thousand
dollars
and
turned
my
back
upon
this
ungrateful
town
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
also
left
behind
me
the
last
of
my
good
luck
i
traveled
in
a
leisurely
way
until
i
reached
boston
the
country
anywhere
would
have
been
safer
but
i
do
not
lean
to
agricultural
pursuits
it
seemed
an
agreeable
city
and
i
decided
to
remain
i
took
good
rooms
at
parker
s
and
concluding
to
enjoy
life
amused
myself
in
the
company
of
certain
i
may
say
uncertain
young
women
who
danced
at
some
of
the
theaters
i
played
billiards
drank
rather
too
much
drove
fast
horses
and
at
the
end
of
a
delightful
year
was
shocked
to
find
myself
in
debt
and
with
only
seven
dollars
and
cents
left
i
like
to
be
accurate
i
had
only
one
resource
i
determined
to
visit
my
deaf
aunt
and
peninnah
and
to
see
what
i
could
do
in
the
role
of
the
prodigal
nephew
at
all
events
i
should
gain
time
to
think
of
what
new
enterprise
i
could
take
up
but
above
all
i
needed
a
little
capital
and
a
house
over
my
head
i
had
pawned
nearly
everything
of
any
value
which
i
possessed
i
left
my
debts
to
gather
interest
and
went
away
to
woodbury
it
was
the
day
before
christmas
when
i
reached
the
little
jersey
town
and
it
was
also
by
good
luck
sunday
i
was
hungry
and
quite
penniless
i
wandered
about
until
church
had
begun
because
i
was
sure
then
to
find
aunt
rachel
and
peninnah
out
at
the
service
and
i
desired
to
explore
a
little
the
house
was
closed
and
even
the
one
servant
absent
i
got
in
with
ease
at
the
back
through
the
kitchen
and
having
at
least
an
hour
and
a
half
free
from
interruption
i
made
a
leisurely
search
the
role
of
prodigal
was
well
enough
but
here
was
a
better
chance
and
an
indulgent
opportunity
in
a
few
moments
i
found
the
famous
bible
hid
away
under
aunt
rachel
s
mattress
the
bible
bank
was
fat
with
notes
but
i
intended
to
be
moderate
enough
to
escape
suspicion
here
were
quite
two
thousand
dollars
i
resolved
to
take
just
now
only
one
hundred
so
as
to
keep
a
good
balance
then
alas
i
lit
on
a
long
envelop
my
aunt
s
will
every
cent
was
left
to
christ
church
not
a
dime
to
poor
pen
or
to
me
i
was
in
a
rage
i
tore
up
the
will
and
replaced
the
envelop
to
treat
poor
pen
that
way
pen
of
all
people
there
was
a
heap
more
will
than
testament
for
all
it
was
in
the
bible
after
that
i
thought
it
was
right
to
punish
the
old
witch
and
so
i
took
every
note
i
could
find
when
i
was
through
with
this
business
i
put
back
the
bible
under
the
mattress
and
observing
that
i
had
been
quite
too
long
i
went
downstairs
with
a
keen
desire
to
leave
the
town
as
early
as
possible
i
was
tempted
however
to
look
further
and
was
rewarded
by
finding
in
an
old
clock
case
a
small
reticule
stuffed
with
this
i
appropriated
and
made
haste
to
go
out
i
was
too
late
as
i
went
into
the
little
entry
to
get
my
hat
and
coat
aunt
rachel
entered
followed
by
peninnah
at
sight
of
me
my
aunt
cried
out
that
i
was
a
monster
and
fit
for
the
penitentiary
as
she
could
not
hear
at
all
she
had
the
talk
to
herself
and
went
by
me
and
rumbling
abuse
like
distant
thunder
overhead
meanwhile
i
was
taken
up
with
pen
the
pretty
fool
was
seated
on
a
chair
all
dressed
up
in
her
sunday
finery
and
rocking
backward
and
forward
crying
oh
oh
ah
like
a
lamb
saying
baa
baa
baa
she
never
had
much
sense
i
had
to
shake
her
to
get
a
reasonable
word
she
mopped
her
eyes
and
i
heard
her
gasp
out
that
my
aunt
had
at
last
decided
that
i
was
the
person
who
had
thinned
her
hoards
this
was
bad
but
involved
less
inconvenience
than
it
might
have
done
an
hour
earlier
amid
tears
pen
told
me
that
a
detective
had
been
at
the
house
inquiring
for
me
when
this
happened
it
seems
that
the
poor
little
goose
had
tried
to
fool
deaf
aunt
rachel
with
some
story
as
to
the
man
having
come
about
taxes
i
suppose
the
girl
was
not
any
too
sharp
and
the
old
woman
i
guess
read
enough
from
merely
seeing
the
man
s
lips
you
never
could
keep
anything
from
her
and
she
was
both
curious
and
suspicious
she
assured
the
officer
that
i
was
a
thief
and
hoped
i
might
be
caught
i
could
not
learn
whether
the
man
told
pen
any
particulars
but
as
i
was
slowly
getting
at
the
facts
we
heard
a
loud
scream
and
a
heavy
fall
pen
said
oh
oh
and
we
hurried
upstairs
there
was
the
old
woman
on
the
floor
her
face
twitching
to
right
and
her
breathing
a
sort
of
hoarse
croak
the
big
bible
lay
open
on
the
floor
and
i
knew
what
had
happened
it
was
a
fit
of
apoplexy
at
this
very
unpleasant
sight
pen
seemed
to
recover
her
wits
and
said
go
away
go
away
oh
brother
brother
now
i
know
you
have
stolen
her
money
and
killed
her
and
and
i
loved
you
i
was
so
proud
of
you
oh
oh
this
was
all
very
fine
but
the
advice
was
good
i
said
yes
i
had
better
go
run
and
get
some
one
a
doctor
it
is
a
fit
of
hysterics
there
is
no
danger
i
will
write
to
you
you
are
quite
this
was
too
feeble
even
for
pen
and
she
cried
no
never
i
never
want
to
see
you
again
you
would
kill
me
stuff
said
i
and
ran
i
seized
my
coat
and
hat
and
went
to
the
tavern
where
i
got
a
man
to
drive
me
to
camden
i
have
never
seen
pen
since
as
i
crossed
the
ferry
to
philadelphia
i
saw
that
i
should
have
asked
when
the
detective
had
been
after
me
i
suspected
from
pen
s
terror
that
it
had
been
recently
it
was
sunday
and
as
i
reminded
myself
the
day
before
christmas
the
ground
was
covered
with
snow
and
as
i
walked
up
market
street
my
feet
were
soon
soaked
in
my
haste
i
had
left
my
overshoes
i
was
very
cold
and
as
i
now
see
foolishly
fearful
i
kept
thinking
of
what
a
conspicuous
thing
a
head
is
and
of
how
many
people
knew
me
as
i
reached
woodbury
early
and
without
a
cent
i
had
eaten
nothing
all
day
i
relied
on
pen
now
i
concluded
to
go
down
into
my
old
neighborhood
and
get
a
lodging
where
no
references
were
asked
next
day
i
would
secure
a
disguise
and
get
out
of
the
way
i
had
passed
the
day
without
food
as
i
have
just
said
and
having
ample
means
concluded
to
go
somewhere
and
get
a
good
dinner
it
was
now
close
to
three
in
the
afternoon
i
was
aware
of
two
things
that
i
was
making
many
plans
and
giving
them
up
as
soon
as
made
and
that
i
was
suddenly
afraid
without
cause
afraid
to
enter
an
and
in
fear
of
every
man
i
met
i
went
on
feeling
more
and
more
chilly
when
a
man
is
really
cold
his
mind
does
not
work
well
and
now
it
was
blowing
a
keen
gale
from
the
north
at
second
and
south
i
came
plump
on
a
policeman
i
knew
he
looked
at
me
through
the
drifting
snow
as
if
he
was
uncertain
and
twice
looked
back
after
having
passed
me
i
turned
west
at
christian
street
when
i
looked
behind
me
the
man
was
standing
at
the
corner
staring
after
me
at
the
next
turn
i
hurried
away
northward
in
a
sort
of
anguish
of
terror
i
have
said
i
was
an
uncommon
person
i
am
i
am
sensitive
too
my
mind
is
much
above
the
average
but
unless
i
am
warm
and
well
fed
it
does
not
act
well
and
i
make
mistakes
at
that
time
i
was
half
frozen
in
need
of
food
and
absurdly
scared
then
that
old
fool
squirming
on
the
floor
got
on
to
my
nerves
i
went
on
and
on
and
at
last
into
second
street
until
i
came
to
christ
church
of
all
places
for
me
i
heard
the
sound
of
the
organ
in
the
afternoon
service
i
felt
i
must
go
in
and
get
warm
here
was
another
silly
notion
i
was
afraid
of
hotels
but
not
of
the
church
i
reasoned
vaguely
that
it
was
a
dark
day
and
darker
in
the
church
and
so
i
went
in
at
the
church
alley
entrance
and
sat
near
the
north
door
no
one
noticed
me
i
sat
still
in
a
pew
well
hid
and
wondering
what
was
the
matter
with
me
it
was
curious
that
a
doctor
and
a
man
of
my
intelligence
should
have
been
long
in
guessing
a
thing
so
simple
for
two
months
i
had
been
drinking
hard
and
for
two
days
had
quit
being
a
man
capable
of
great
and
also
being
short
of
money
just
before
the
benediction
i
saw
a
man
near
by
who
seemed
to
stare
at
me
in
deadly
fear
i
got
up
and
quickly
slipped
through
a
door
into
the
tower
room
i
said
to
myself
he
will
follow
me
or
wait
i
stood
a
moment
with
my
head
all
of
a
whirl
and
then
in
a
shiver
of
fear
ran
up
the
stairs
to
the
tower
until
i
got
into
the
s
room
i
was
safe
i
sat
down
on
a
stool
twitching
and
tremulous
there
were
the
old
books
on
and
the
miniature
chime
of
small
bells
for
instruction
the
wind
had
easy
entrance
and
it
swung
the
eight
ropes
about
in
a
way
i
did
not
like
i
remember
saying
oh
don
t
do
at
last
i
had
a
mad
desire
to
ring
one
of
the
bells
as
a
loop
of
rope
swung
toward
me
it
seemed
to
hold
a
face
and
this
face
cried
out
come
and
hang
yourself
then
the
bell
will
if
i
slept
i
do
not
know
i
may
have
done
so
certainly
i
must
have
stayed
there
many
hours
i
was
dull
and
confused
and
yet
on
my
guard
for
when
far
into
the
night
i
heard
noises
below
i
ran
up
the
steeper
steps
which
ascend
to
the
steeple
where
are
the
bells
up
i
sat
down
on
the
stair
the
place
was
cold
and
the
darkness
deep
then
i
heard
the
eight
ringers
down
below
one
said
never
knowed
a
christmas
like
this
since
zeb
sanderaft
died
come
boys
i
knew
it
must
be
close
on
to
midnight
now
they
would
play
a
christmas
carol
i
used
every
christmas
to
be
roused
up
and
carried
here
and
set
on
dad
s
shoulder
when
they
were
done
ringing
number
two
always
gave
me
a
box
of
and
a
large
red
apple
as
they
rang
off
my
father
would
cry
out
one
two
and
so
on
and
then
cry
elias
all
over
town
people
are
opening
windows
to
i
seemed
to
hear
him
as
i
sat
in
the
gloom
then
i
heard
all
ready
one
two
and
they
rang
the
christmas
carol
overhead
i
heard
the
great
bells
ringing
out
and
all
the
bells
on
earth
shall
ring
on
christmas
day
on
christmas
day
i
felt
suddenly
excited
and
began
to
hum
the
air
great
heavens
there
was
the
old
woman
aunt
rachel
with
her
face
going
twitch
twitch
the
croak
of
her
breathing
keeping
a
sort
of
mad
time
with
on
christmas
day
on
christmas
i
jumped
up
she
was
gone
i
knew
in
a
hazy
sort
of
way
what
was
the
matter
with
me
but
i
had
still
the
sense
to
sit
down
and
wait
i
said
now
it
would
be
snakes
for
once
before
i
had
been
almost
as
bad
but
what
i
did
see
was
a
little
boy
in
a
white
frock
and
pantalets
climbing
up
the
stairs
right
leg
first
so
queer
of
me
to
have
noticed
that
i
knew
i
was
that
boy
he
was
an
little
chap
and
was
smiling
he
seemed
to
me
to
grow
and
grow
and
at
last
was
a
big
man
with
a
live
rat
in
his
hand
i
saw
nothing
more
but
i
surely
knew
i
needed
whisky
i
waited
until
all
was
still
and
got
down
and
out
for
i
knew
every
window
i
soon
found
a
tavern
and
got
a
drink
and
some
food
at
once
my
fear
left
me
i
was
warm
at
last
and
clear
of
head
and
had
again
my
natural
courage
i
was
well
aware
that
i
was
on
the
edge
of
delirium
tremens
and
must
be
most
prudent
i
paid
in
advance
for
my
room
and
treated
myself
as
i
had
done
many
another
only
a
man
of
unusual
force
could
have
managed
his
own
case
as
i
did
i
went
out
only
at
night
and
in
a
week
was
well
enough
to
travel
during
this
time
i
saw
now
and
then
that
grinning
little
fellow
sometimes
he
had
an
apple
and
was
eating
it
i
do
not
know
why
he
was
worse
to
me
than
snakes
or
the
twitchy
old
woman
with
her
wide
eyes
of
glass
and
that
jerk
jerk
to
right
i
decided
to
go
back
to
boston
i
got
to
new
york
prudently
in
a
roundabout
way
and
in
two
weeks
time
was
traveling
east
from
albany
i
felt
well
and
my
spirits
began
at
last
to
rise
to
their
usual
level
when
i
arrived
in
boston
i
set
myself
to
thinking
how
best
i
could
contrive
to
enjoy
life
and
at
the
same
time
to
increase
my
means
i
possessed
sufficient
capital
and
was
able
and
ready
to
embark
in
whatever
promised
the
best
returns
with
the
smallest
personal
risks
i
settled
myself
in
a
suburb
paid
off
a
few
pressing
claims
and
began
to
reflect
with
my
ordinary
sagacity
we
were
now
in
the
midst
of
a
most
absurd
war
with
the
south
and
it
was
becoming
difficult
to
escape
the
net
of
conscription
it
might
be
wise
to
think
of
this
in
time
europe
seemed
a
desirable
residence
but
i
needed
more
money
to
make
this
agreeable
and
an
investment
for
my
brains
was
what
i
wanted
most
many
schemes
presented
themselves
as
worthy
the
application
of
industry
and
talent
but
none
of
them
altogether
suited
my
case
i
thought
at
times
of
traveling
as
a
physiological
lecturer
combining
with
it
the
business
of
a
practitioner
scare
the
audience
at
night
with
an
enumeration
of
symptoms
which
belong
to
ten
out
of
every
dozen
healthy
people
and
then
doctor
such
of
them
as
are
gulls
enough
to
consult
me
next
day
the
bigger
the
fright
the
better
the
pay
i
was
a
little
timid
however
about
facing
large
audiences
as
a
man
will
be
naturally
if
he
has
lived
a
life
of
adventure
so
that
upon
due
consideration
i
gave
up
the
idea
altogether
the
patent
medicine
business
also
looked
well
enough
but
it
is
somewhat
overdone
at
all
times
and
requires
a
heavy
outlay
with
the
probable
result
of
ill
success
indeed
i
believe
one
hundred
quack
remedies
fail
for
one
that
succeeds
and
millions
must
have
been
wasted
in
placards
bills
and
advertisements
which
never
returned
half
their
value
to
the
speculator
i
think
i
shall
some
day
beguile
my
time
with
writing
an
account
of
the
principal
quack
remedies
which
have
met
with
success
they
are
few
in
number
after
all
as
any
one
must
know
who
recalls
the
countless
pills
and
tonics
which
are
puffed
awhile
on
the
fences
and
disappear
to
be
heard
of
no
more
lastly
i
inclined
for
a
while
to
undertake
a
private
insane
asylum
which
appeared
to
me
to
offer
facilities
for
as
to
which
however
i
may
have
been
deceived
by
the
writings
of
certain
popular
novelists
i
went
so
far
i
may
say
as
actually
to
visit
concord
for
the
purpose
of
finding
a
pleasant
locality
and
a
suitable
atmosphere
upon
reflection
i
abandoned
my
plans
as
involving
too
much
personal
labor
to
suit
one
of
my
easy
frame
of
mind
tired
at
last
of
idleness
and
lounging
on
the
common
i
engaged
in
two
or
three
little
ventures
of
a
character
such
as
an
exhibition
of
advertising
to
cure
cancer
send
stamps
by
mail
to
j
and
receive
an
infallible
receipt
etc
i
did
not
find
however
that
these
little
enterprises
prospered
well
in
new
england
and
i
had
recalled
very
forcibly
a
story
which
my
father
was
fond
of
relating
to
me
in
my
boyhood
it
was
about
how
certain
very
knowing
flies
went
to
get
molasses
and
how
it
ended
by
the
molasses
getting
them
this
indeed
was
precisely
what
happened
to
me
in
all
my
efforts
to
better
myself
in
the
northern
states
until
at
length
my
misfortunes
climaxed
in
total
and
unexpected
ruin
having
been
very
economical
i
had
now
about
hundred
dollars
it
was
none
too
much
at
this
time
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
from
maine
he
told
me
that
he
and
two
others
had
chartered
a
smart
little
steamer
to
run
to
jamaica
with
a
variety
cargo
in
fact
he
meant
to
run
into
wilmington
or
charleston
and
he
was
to
carry
quinine
chloroform
and
other
medical
requirements
for
the
confederates
he
needed
hundred
dollars
more
and
a
doctor
to
buy
the
kind
of
things
which
army
surgeons
require
of
course
i
was
prudent
and
he
careful
but
at
last
on
his
proving
to
me
that
there
was
no
risk
i
agreed
to
expend
his
money
his
friends
and
my
own
up
to
hundred
dollars
i
saw
the
other
men
one
of
them
a
rebel
captain
i
was
well
pleased
with
the
venture
and
resolved
for
obvious
reasons
to
go
with
them
on
the
steamer
it
was
a
promising
investment
and
i
am
free
to
reflect
that
in
this
as
in
some
other
things
i
have
been
free
from
vulgar
prejudices
i
bought
all
that
we
needed
and
was
well
satisfied
when
it
was
cleverly
stowed
away
in
the
hold
we
were
to
sail
on
a
certain
thursday
morning
in
september
i
sent
my
trunk
to
the
vessel
and
went
down
the
evening
before
we
were
to
start
to
go
on
board
but
found
that
the
little
steamer
had
been
hauled
out
from
the
pier
the
captain
who
met
me
at
this
time
endeavored
to
get
a
boat
to
ferry
us
to
the
ship
but
a
gale
was
blowing
and
he
advised
me
to
wait
until
morning
my
associates
were
already
on
board
early
next
day
i
dressed
and
went
to
the
captain
s
room
which
proved
to
be
empty
i
was
instantly
filled
with
doubt
and
ran
frantically
to
the
long
wharf
where
to
my
horror
i
could
see
no
signs
of
the
vessel
or
captain
neither
have
i
ever
set
eyes
on
them
from
that
time
to
this
i
thought
of
lodging
information
with
the
police
as
to
the
unpatriotic
design
of
the
rascal
who
swindled
me
but
on
the
whole
concluded
that
it
was
best
to
hold
my
tongue
it
was
as
i
perceived
such
utterly
spilt
milk
as
to
be
little
worth
lamenting
and
i
therefore
set
to
work
with
my
accustomed
energy
to
utilize
on
my
own
behalf
the
resources
of
my
medical
education
which
so
often
before
had
saved
me
from
want
the
war
then
raging
at
its
height
appeared
to
offer
numerous
opportunities
to
men
of
talent
the
path
which
i
chose
was
apparently
a
humble
one
but
it
enabled
me
to
make
very
practical
use
of
my
professional
knowledge
and
afforded
for
a
time
rapid
and
secure
returns
without
any
other
investment
than
a
little
knowledge
cautiously
employed
in
the
first
place
i
deposited
my
small
remnant
of
property
in
a
safe
bank
then
i
went
to
providence
where
as
i
had
heard
patriotic
persons
were
giving
very
large
bounties
in
order
i
suppose
to
insure
the
government
the
services
of
better
men
than
themselves
on
my
arrival
i
lost
no
time
in
offering
myself
as
a
substitute
and
was
readily
accepted
and
very
soon
mustered
into
the
twentieth
rhode
island
three
months
were
passed
in
camp
during
which
period
i
received
bounty
to
the
extent
of
six
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
with
which
i
tranquilly
deserted
about
two
hours
before
the
regiment
left
for
the
field
with
the
product
of
my
industry
i
returned
to
boston
and
deposited
all
but
enough
to
carry
me
to
new
york
where
within
a
month
i
enlisted
twice
earning
on
each
occasion
four
hundred
dollars
after
this
i
thought
it
wise
to
try
the
same
game
in
some
of
the
smaller
towns
near
to
philadelphia
i
approached
my
birthplace
with
a
good
deal
of
doubt
but
i
selected
a
regiment
in
camp
at
norristown
which
is
eighteen
miles
away
here
i
got
nearly
seven
hundred
dollars
by
entering
the
service
as
a
substitute
for
an
editor
whose
pen
i
presume
was
mightier
than
his
sword
i
was
however
disagreeably
surprised
by
being
hastily
forwarded
to
the
front
under
a
foxy
young
lieutenant
who
brutally
shot
down
a
poor
devil
in
the
streets
of
baltimore
for
attempting
to
desert
at
this
point
i
began
to
make
use
of
my
medical
skill
for
i
did
not
in
the
least
degree
fancy
being
shot
either
because
of
deserting
or
of
not
deserting
it
happened
therefore
that
a
day
or
two
later
while
in
washington
i
was
seized
in
the
street
with
a
fit
which
perfectly
imposed
upon
the
officer
in
charge
and
caused
him
to
leave
me
at
the
douglas
hospital
here
i
found
it
necessary
to
perform
fits
about
twice
a
week
and
as
there
were
several
real
epileptics
in
the
ward
i
had
a
capital
chance
of
studying
their
symptoms
which
finally
i
learned
to
imitate
with
the
utmost
cleverness
i
soon
got
to
know
three
or
four
men
who
like
myself
were
personally
averse
to
bullets
and
who
were
simulating
other
forms
of
disease
with
more
or
less
success
one
of
them
suffered
with
rheumatism
of
the
back
and
walked
about
like
an
old
man
another
who
had
been
to
the
front
was
palsied
in
the
right
arm
a
third
kept
open
an
ulcer
on
the
leg
rubbing
in
a
little
antimonial
ointment
which
i
bought
at
fifty
cents
and
sold
him
at
five
dollars
a
box
a
change
in
the
hospital
staff
brought
all
of
us
to
grief
the
new
surgeon
was
a
quiet
gentlemanly
person
with
pleasant
blue
eyes
and
clearly
cut
features
and
a
way
of
looking
at
you
without
saying
much
i
felt
so
safe
myself
that
i
watched
his
procedures
with
just
that
kind
of
enjoyment
which
one
clever
man
takes
in
seeing
another
at
work
the
first
inspection
settled
two
of
us
another
back
case
said
the
assistant
surgeon
to
his
senior
back
hurt
you
says
the
latter
mildly
yes
sir
run
over
by
a
howitzer
ain
t
never
been
able
to
stand
straight
a
howitzer
says
the
surgeon
lean
forward
my
man
so
as
to
touch
the
floor
so
that
will
then
turning
to
his
aid
he
said
prepare
this
man
s
discharge
his
discharge
sir
yes
i
said
that
who
s
next
thank
you
sir
groaned
the
man
with
the
back
how
soon
sir
do
you
think
it
will
be
ah
not
less
than
a
month
replied
the
surgeon
and
passed
on
now
as
it
was
unpleasant
to
be
bent
like
the
letter
c
and
as
the
patient
presumed
that
his
discharge
was
secure
he
naturally
allowed
himself
a
little
relaxation
in
the
way
of
becoming
straighter
unluckily
those
nice
blue
eyes
were
everywhere
at
all
hours
and
one
fine
morning
smithson
was
appalled
at
finding
himself
in
a
detachment
bound
for
the
field
and
bearing
on
his
descriptive
list
an
indorsement
about
his
malady
the
surgeon
came
next
on
o
callahan
standing
like
each
of
us
at
the
foot
of
his
own
bed
i
ve
paralytics
in
my
arm
he
said
with
intention
to
explain
his
failure
to
salute
his
superior
humph
said
the
surgeon
you
have
another
an
it
s
not
the
rigulation
to
saloot
with
yer
left
said
the
irishman
with
a
grin
while
the
patients
around
us
began
to
smile
how
did
it
happen
said
the
surgeon
i
was
shot
in
the
shoulder
answered
the
patient
about
three
months
ago
sir
i
haven
t
stirred
it
the
surgeon
looked
at
the
scar
so
recently
said
he
the
scar
looks
older
and
by
the
way
doctor
to
his
junior
it
could
not
have
gone
near
the
nerves
bring
the
battery
in
a
few
moments
the
surgeon
was
testing
one
after
another
the
various
muscles
at
last
he
stopped
send
this
man
away
with
the
next
detachment
not
a
word
my
man
you
are
a
rascal
and
a
disgrace
to
honest
men
who
have
been
among
the
man
muttered
something
i
did
not
hear
what
put
this
man
in
the
cried
the
surgeon
and
so
passed
on
without
smile
or
frown
as
to
the
ulcer
case
to
my
amusement
he
was
put
in
bed
and
his
leg
locked
up
in
a
wooden
splint
which
effectually
prevented
him
from
touching
the
part
diseased
it
healed
in
ten
days
and
he
too
went
as
food
for
powder
the
surgeon
asked
me
a
few
questions
and
requesting
to
be
sent
for
during
my
next
fit
left
me
alone
i
was
of
course
on
my
guard
and
took
care
to
have
my
attacks
only
during
his
absence
or
to
have
them
over
before
he
arrived
at
length
one
morning
in
spite
of
my
care
he
chanced
to
enter
the
ward
as
i
fell
on
the
floor
i
was
laid
on
the
bed
apparently
in
strong
convulsions
presently
i
felt
a
finger
on
my
eyelid
and
as
it
was
raised
saw
the
surgeon
standing
beside
me
to
escape
his
scrutiny
i
became
more
violent
in
my
motions
he
stopped
a
moment
and
looked
at
me
steadily
poor
fellow
said
he
to
my
great
relief
as
i
felt
at
once
that
i
had
successfully
deceived
him
then
he
turned
to
the
ward
doctor
and
remarked
take
care
he
does
not
hurt
his
head
against
the
bed
and
by
the
by
doctor
do
you
remember
the
test
we
applied
in
carstairs
s
case
just
tickle
the
soles
of
his
feet
and
see
if
it
will
cause
those
backward
spasms
of
the
the
aid
obeyed
him
and
very
naturally
i
jerked
my
head
backward
as
hard
as
i
could
that
will
answer
said
the
surgeon
to
my
horror
a
clever
rogue
send
him
to
the
happy
had
i
been
had
my
ill
luck
ended
here
but
as
i
crossed
the
yard
an
officer
stopped
me
to
my
disgust
it
was
the
captain
of
my
old
rhode
island
company
hello
said
he
keep
that
fellow
safe
i
know
to
cut
short
a
long
story
i
was
tried
convicted
and
forced
to
refund
the
rhode
island
bounty
for
by
ill
luck
they
found
my
among
my
papers
i
was
finally
sent
to
fort
delaware
and
kept
at
hard
labor
handling
and
carrying
shot
policing
the
ground
picking
up
and
other
light
unpleasant
occupations
when
the
war
was
over
i
was
released
i
went
at
once
to
boston
where
i
had
about
four
hundred
dollars
in
bank
i
spent
nearly
all
of
this
sum
before
i
could
satisfy
the
accumulated
cravings
of
a
year
and
a
half
without
drink
or
tobacco
or
a
decent
meal
i
was
about
to
engage
in
a
little
business
as
a
vender
of
lottery
policies
when
i
first
began
to
feel
a
strange
sense
of
lassitude
which
soon
increased
so
as
quite
to
disable
me
from
work
of
any
kind
month
after
month
passed
away
while
my
money
lessened
and
this
terrible
sense
of
weariness
went
on
from
bad
to
worse
at
last
one
day
after
nearly
a
year
had
elapsed
i
perceived
on
my
face
a
large
brown
patch
of
color
in
consequence
of
which
i
went
in
some
alarm
to
consult
a
physician
he
asked
me
a
multitude
of
tiresome
questions
and
at
last
wrote
off
a
prescription
which
i
immediately
read
it
was
a
preparation
of
arsenic
what
do
you
think
said
i
is
the
matter
with
me
doctor
i
am
afraid
said
he
that
you
have
a
very
serious
trouble
what
we
call
addison
s
what
s
that
said
i
i
do
not
think
you
would
comprehend
it
he
replied
it
is
an
affection
of
the
suprarenal
i
dimly
remembered
that
there
were
such
organs
and
that
nobody
knew
what
they
were
meant
for
it
seemed
that
doctors
had
found
a
use
for
them
at
last
is
it
a
dangerous
disease
i
said
i
fear
so
he
answered
don
t
you
really
know
i
asked
what
s
the
truth
about
it
well
he
returned
gravely
i
m
sorry
to
tell
you
it
is
a
very
dangerous
nonsense
said
i
i
don
t
believe
it
for
i
thought
it
was
only
a
doctor
s
trick
and
one
i
had
tried
often
enough
myself
thank
you
said
he
you
are
a
very
ill
man
and
a
fool
besides
good
he
forgot
to
ask
for
a
fee
and
i
did
not
therefore
find
it
necessary
to
escape
payment
by
telling
him
i
was
a
doctor
several
weeks
went
by
my
money
was
gone
my
clothes
were
ragged
and
like
my
body
nearly
worn
out
and
now
i
am
an
inmate
of
a
hospital
i
feel
weaker
than
when
i
first
began
to
write
how
it
will
end
i
do
not
know
if
i
die
the
doctor
will
get
this
pleasant
history
and
if
i
live
i
shall
burn
it
and
as
soon
as
i
get
a
little
money
i
will
set
out
to
look
for
my
sister
i
dreamed
about
her
last
night
what
i
dreamed
was
not
very
agreeable
i
thought
it
was
night
i
was
walking
up
one
of
the
vilest
streets
near
my
old
office
and
a
girl
spoke
to
me
a
shameless
worn
creature
with
great
sad
eyes
suddenly
she
screamed
brother
brother
and
then
remembering
what
she
had
been
with
her
round
girlish
innocent
face
and
fair
hair
and
seeing
what
she
was
now
i
awoke
and
saw
the
dim
light
of
the
ward
i
am
better
writing
all
this
stuff
has
amused
me
and
i
think
done
me
good
that
was
a
horrid
dream
i
had
i
suppose
i
must
tear
up
all
this
biography
hello
nurse
the
little
boy
boy
good
heavens
said
the
nurse
he
is
dead
alston
said
it
would
happen
this
way
the
screen
quick
the
screen
and
let
the
doctor
the
case
of
george
dedlow
the
following
notes
of
my
own
case
have
been
declined
on
various
pretests
by
every
medical
journal
to
which
i
have
offered
them
there
was
perhaps
some
reason
in
this
because
many
of
the
medical
facts
which
they
record
are
not
altogether
new
and
because
the
psychical
deductions
to
which
they
have
led
me
are
not
in
themselves
of
medical
interest
i
ought
to
add
that
a
great
deal
of
what
is
here
related
is
not
of
any
scientific
value
whatsoever
but
as
one
or
two
people
on
whose
judgment
i
rely
have
advised
me
to
print
my
narrative
with
all
the
personal
details
rather
than
in
the
dry
shape
in
which
as
a
psychological
statement
i
shall
publish
it
elsewhere
i
have
yielded
to
their
views
i
suspect
however
that
the
very
character
of
my
record
will
in
the
eyes
of
some
of
my
readers
tend
to
lessen
the
value
of
the
metaphysical
discoveries
which
it
sets
forth
i
am
the
son
of
a
physician
still
in
large
practice
in
the
village
of
abington
scofield
county
indiana
expecting
to
act
as
his
future
partner
i
studied
medicine
in
his
office
and
in
and
attended
lectures
at
the
jefferson
medical
college
in
philadelphia
my
second
course
should
have
been
in
the
following
year
but
the
outbreak
of
the
rebellion
so
crippled
my
father
s
means
that
i
was
forced
to
abandon
my
intention
the
demand
for
army
surgeons
at
this
time
became
very
great
and
although
not
a
graduate
i
found
no
difficulty
in
getting
the
place
of
assistant
surgeon
to
the
tenth
indiana
volunteers
in
the
subsequent
western
campaigns
this
organization
suffered
so
severely
that
before
the
term
of
its
service
was
over
it
was
merged
in
the
indiana
volunteers
and
i
as
an
extra
surgeon
ranked
by
the
medical
officers
of
the
latter
regiment
was
transferred
to
the
fifteenth
indiana
cavalry
like
many
physicians
i
had
contracted
a
strong
taste
for
army
life
and
disliking
cavalry
service
sought
and
obtained
the
position
of
first
lieutenant
in
the
indiana
volunteers
an
infantry
regiment
of
excellent
character
on
the
day
after
i
assumed
command
of
my
company
which
had
no
captain
we
were
sent
to
garrison
a
part
of
a
line
of
stretching
along
the
cumberland
river
below
nashville
then
occupied
by
a
portion
of
the
command
of
general
rosecrans
the
life
we
led
while
on
this
duty
was
tedious
and
at
the
same
time
dangerous
in
the
extreme
food
was
scarce
and
bad
the
water
horrible
and
we
had
no
cavalry
to
forage
for
us
if
as
infantry
we
attempted
to
levy
supplies
upon
the
scattered
farms
around
us
the
population
seemed
suddenly
to
double
and
in
the
shape
of
guerrillas
potted
us
industriously
from
behind
distant
trees
rocks
or
fences
under
these
various
and
unpleasant
influences
combined
with
a
fair
infusion
of
malaria
our
men
rapidly
lost
health
and
spirits
unfortunately
no
proper
medical
supplies
had
been
forwarded
with
our
small
force
two
companies
and
as
the
fall
advanced
the
want
of
quinine
and
stimulants
became
a
serious
annoyance
moreover
our
rations
were
running
low
we
had
been
three
weeks
without
a
new
supply
and
our
commanding
officer
major
henry
terrill
began
to
be
uneasy
as
to
the
safety
of
his
men
about
this
time
it
was
supposed
that
a
train
with
rations
would
be
due
from
the
post
twenty
miles
to
the
north
of
us
yet
it
was
quite
possible
that
it
would
bring
us
food
but
no
medicines
which
were
what
we
most
needed
the
command
was
too
small
to
detach
any
part
of
it
and
the
major
therefore
resolved
to
send
an
officer
alone
to
the
post
above
us
where
the
rest
of
the
lay
and
whence
they
could
easily
forward
quinine
and
stimulants
by
the
train
if
it
had
not
left
or
if
it
had
by
a
small
cavalry
escort
it
so
happened
to
my
cost
as
it
turned
out
that
i
was
the
only
officer
fit
to
make
the
journey
and
i
was
accordingly
ordered
to
proceed
to
blockhouse
no
and
make
the
required
arrangements
i
started
alone
just
after
dusk
the
next
night
and
during
the
darkness
succeeded
in
getting
within
three
miles
of
my
destination
at
this
time
i
found
that
i
had
lost
my
way
and
although
aware
of
the
danger
of
my
act
was
forced
to
turn
aside
and
ask
at
a
log
cabin
for
directions
the
house
contained
a
old
woman
and
four
children
the
woman
was
either
or
pretended
to
be
so
but
at
all
events
she
gave
me
no
satisfaction
and
i
remounted
and
rode
away
on
coming
to
the
end
of
a
lane
into
which
i
had
turned
to
seek
the
cabin
i
found
to
my
surprise
that
the
bars
had
been
put
up
during
my
brief
parley
they
were
too
high
to
leap
and
i
therefore
dismounted
to
pull
them
down
as
i
touched
the
top
rail
i
heard
a
rifle
and
at
the
same
instant
felt
a
blow
on
both
arms
which
fell
helpless
i
staggered
to
my
horse
and
tried
to
mount
but
as
i
could
use
neither
arm
the
effort
was
vain
and
i
therefore
stood
still
awaiting
my
fate
i
am
only
conscious
that
i
saw
about
me
several
graybacks
for
i
must
have
fallen
fainting
almost
immediately
when
i
awoke
i
was
lying
in
the
cabin
near
by
upon
a
pile
of
rubbish
ten
or
twelve
guerrillas
were
gathered
about
the
fire
apparently
drawing
lots
for
my
watch
boots
hat
etc
i
now
made
an
effort
to
find
out
how
far
i
was
hurt
i
discovered
that
i
could
use
the
left
forearm
and
hand
pretty
well
and
with
this
hand
i
felt
the
right
limb
all
over
until
i
touched
the
wound
the
ball
had
passed
from
left
to
right
through
the
left
biceps
and
directly
through
the
right
arm
just
below
the
shoulder
emerging
behind
the
right
arm
and
forearm
were
cold
and
perfectly
insensible
i
pinched
them
as
well
as
i
could
to
test
the
amount
of
sensation
remaining
but
the
hand
might
as
well
have
been
that
of
a
dead
man
i
began
to
understand
that
the
nerves
had
been
wounded
and
that
the
part
was
utterly
powerless
by
this
time
my
friends
had
pretty
well
divided
the
spoils
and
rising
together
went
out
the
old
woman
then
came
to
me
and
said
reckon
you
d
best
git
up
uns
is
to
take
you
to
this
i
only
answered
water
i
had
a
grim
sense
of
amusement
on
finding
that
the
old
woman
was
not
deaf
for
she
went
out
and
presently
came
back
with
a
gourdful
which
i
eagerly
drank
an
hour
later
the
graybacks
returned
and
finding
that
i
was
too
weak
to
walk
carried
me
out
and
laid
me
on
the
bottom
of
a
common
cart
with
which
they
set
off
on
a
trot
the
jolting
was
horrible
but
within
an
hour
i
began
to
have
in
my
dead
right
hand
a
strange
burning
which
was
rather
a
relief
to
me
it
increased
as
the
sun
rose
and
the
day
grew
warm
until
i
felt
as
if
the
hand
was
caught
and
pinched
in
a
vise
then
in
my
agony
i
begged
my
guard
for
water
to
wet
it
with
but
for
some
reason
they
desired
silence
and
at
every
noise
threatened
me
with
a
revolver
at
length
the
pain
became
absolutely
unendurable
and
i
grew
what
it
is
the
fashion
to
call
demoralized
i
screamed
cried
and
yelled
in
my
torture
until
as
i
suppose
my
captors
became
alarmed
and
stopping
gave
me
a
handkerchief
my
own
i
fancy
and
a
canteen
of
water
with
which
i
wetted
the
hand
to
my
unspeakable
relief
it
is
unnecessary
to
detail
the
events
by
which
finally
i
found
myself
in
one
of
the
rebel
hospitals
near
atlanta
here
for
the
first
time
my
wounds
were
properly
cleansed
and
dressed
by
a
oliver
wilson
who
treated
me
throughout
with
great
kindness
i
told
him
i
had
been
a
doctor
which
perhaps
may
have
been
in
part
the
cause
of
the
unusual
tenderness
with
which
i
was
managed
the
left
arm
was
now
quite
easy
although
as
will
be
seen
it
never
entirely
healed
the
right
arm
was
worse
than
ever
the
humerus
broken
the
nerves
wounded
and
the
hand
alive
only
to
pain
i
use
this
phrase
because
it
is
connected
in
my
mind
with
a
visit
from
a
local
visitor
i
am
not
sure
he
was
a
preacher
who
used
to
go
daily
through
the
wards
and
talk
to
us
or
write
our
letters
one
morning
he
stopped
at
my
bed
when
this
little
talk
occurred
how
are
you
lieutenant
oh
said
i
as
usual
all
right
but
this
hand
which
is
dead
except
to
ah
said
he
such
and
thus
will
the
wicked
be
such
will
you
be
if
you
die
in
your
sins
you
will
go
where
only
pain
can
be
felt
for
all
eternity
all
of
you
will
be
just
like
that
hand
knowing
pain
i
suppose
i
was
very
weak
but
somehow
i
felt
a
sudden
and
chilling
horror
of
possible
universal
pain
and
suddenly
fainted
when
i
awoke
the
hand
was
worse
if
that
could
be
it
was
red
shining
aching
burning
and
as
it
seemed
to
me
perpetually
rasped
with
hot
files
when
the
doctor
came
i
begged
for
morphia
he
said
gravely
we
have
none
you
know
you
don
t
allow
it
to
pass
the
it
was
sadly
true
i
turned
to
the
wall
and
wetted
the
hand
again
my
sole
relief
in
about
an
hour
wilson
came
back
with
two
aids
and
explained
to
me
that
the
bone
was
so
crushed
as
to
make
it
hopeless
to
save
it
and
that
besides
amputation
offered
some
chance
of
arresting
the
pain
i
had
thought
of
this
before
but
the
anguish
i
felt
i
can
not
say
endured
was
so
awful
that
i
made
no
more
of
losing
the
limb
than
of
parting
with
a
tooth
on
account
of
toothache
accordingly
brief
preparations
were
made
which
i
watched
with
a
sort
of
eagerness
such
as
must
forever
be
inexplicable
to
any
one
who
has
not
passed
six
weeks
of
torture
like
that
which
i
had
suffered
i
had
but
one
pang
before
the
operation
as
i
arranged
myself
on
the
left
side
so
as
to
make
it
convenient
for
the
operator
to
use
the
knife
i
asked
who
is
to
give
me
the
ether
we
have
none
said
the
person
questioned
i
set
my
teeth
and
said
no
more
i
need
not
describe
the
operation
the
pain
felt
was
severe
but
it
was
insignificant
as
compared
with
that
of
any
other
minute
of
the
past
six
weeks
the
limb
was
removed
very
near
to
the
as
the
second
incision
was
made
i
felt
a
strange
flash
of
pain
play
through
the
limb
as
if
it
were
in
every
minutest
fibril
of
nerve
this
was
followed
by
instant
unspeakable
relief
and
before
the
flaps
were
brought
together
i
was
sound
asleep
i
dimly
remember
saying
as
i
pointed
to
the
arm
which
lay
on
the
floor
there
is
the
pain
and
here
am
i
how
queer
then
i
slept
slept
the
sleep
of
the
just
or
better
of
the
painless
from
this
time
forward
i
was
free
from
neuralgia
at
a
subsequent
period
i
saw
a
number
of
cases
similar
to
mine
in
a
hospital
in
philadelphia
it
is
no
part
of
my
plan
to
detail
my
weary
months
of
monotonous
prison
life
in
the
south
in
the
early
part
of
april
i
was
exchanged
and
after
the
usual
thirty
days
furlough
returned
to
my
regiment
a
captain
on
the
of
september
occurred
the
battle
of
chickamauga
in
which
my
regiment
took
a
conspicuous
part
the
close
of
our
own
share
in
this
contest
is
as
it
were
burned
into
my
memory
with
every
least
detail
it
was
about
when
we
found
ourselves
in
line
under
cover
of
a
long
thin
row
of
scrubby
trees
beyond
which
lay
a
gentle
slope
from
which
again
rose
a
hill
rather
more
abrupt
and
crowned
with
an
earthwork
we
received
orders
to
cross
this
space
and
take
the
fort
in
front
while
a
brigade
on
our
right
was
to
make
a
like
movement
on
its
flank
just
before
we
emerged
into
the
open
ground
we
noticed
what
i
think
was
common
in
many
fights
that
the
enemy
had
begun
to
bowl
round
shot
at
us
probably
from
failure
of
shell
we
passed
across
the
valley
in
good
order
although
the
men
fell
rapidly
all
along
the
line
as
we
climbed
the
hill
our
pace
slackened
and
the
fire
grew
heavier
at
this
moment
a
battery
opened
on
our
left
the
shots
crossing
our
heads
obliquely
it
is
this
moment
which
is
so
printed
on
my
recollection
i
can
see
now
as
if
through
a
window
the
gray
smoke
lit
with
red
flashes
the
long
wavering
line
the
sky
blue
above
the
trodden
furrows
blotted
with
blue
blouses
then
it
was
as
if
the
window
closed
and
i
knew
and
saw
no
more
no
other
scene
in
my
life
is
thus
scarred
if
i
may
say
so
into
my
memory
i
have
a
fancy
that
the
horrible
shock
which
suddenly
fell
upon
me
must
have
had
something
to
do
with
thus
intensifying
the
momentary
image
then
before
my
eyes
when
i
awakened
i
was
lying
under
a
tree
somewhere
at
the
rear
the
ground
was
covered
with
wounded
and
the
doctors
were
busy
at
an
improvised
from
two
barrels
and
a
plank
at
length
two
of
them
who
were
examining
the
wounded
about
me
came
up
to
where
i
lay
a
hospital
steward
raised
my
head
and
poured
down
some
brandy
and
water
while
another
cut
loose
my
pantaloons
the
doctors
exchanged
looks
and
walked
away
i
asked
the
steward
where
i
was
hit
both
thighs
said
he
the
doctors
won
t
do
no
use
said
i
not
much
said
he
not
much
means
none
at
all
i
answered
when
he
had
gone
i
set
myself
to
thinking
about
a
good
many
things
i
had
better
have
thought
of
before
but
which
in
no
way
concern
the
history
of
my
case
a
went
by
i
had
no
pain
and
did
not
get
weaker
at
last
i
can
not
explain
why
i
began
to
look
about
me
at
first
things
appeared
a
little
hazy
i
remember
one
thing
which
thrilled
me
a
little
even
then
a
tall
major
walked
up
to
a
doctor
near
me
saying
when
you
ve
a
little
leisure
just
take
a
look
at
my
do
it
now
said
the
doctor
the
officer
exposed
his
wound
ball
went
in
here
and
out
the
doctor
looked
up
at
him
half
pity
half
amazement
if
you
ve
got
any
message
you
d
best
send
it
by
why
you
don
t
say
it
s
serious
was
the
reply
serious
why
you
re
shot
through
the
stomach
you
won
t
live
over
the
then
the
man
did
what
struck
me
as
a
very
odd
thing
he
said
anybody
got
a
pipe
some
one
gave
him
a
pipe
he
filled
it
deliberately
struck
a
light
with
a
flint
and
sat
down
against
a
tree
near
to
me
presently
the
doctor
came
to
him
again
and
asked
him
what
he
could
do
for
him
send
me
a
drink
of
anything
else
as
the
doctor
left
him
he
called
him
back
it
s
a
little
rough
doc
isn
t
it
no
more
passed
and
i
saw
this
man
no
longer
another
set
of
doctors
were
handling
my
legs
for
the
first
time
causing
pain
a
moment
after
a
steward
put
a
towel
over
my
mouth
and
i
smelled
the
familiar
odor
of
chloroform
which
i
was
glad
enough
to
breathe
in
a
moment
the
trees
began
to
move
around
from
left
to
right
faster
and
faster
then
a
universal
grayness
came
before
me
and
i
recall
nothing
further
until
i
awoke
to
consciousness
in
a
i
got
hold
of
my
own
identity
in
a
moment
or
two
and
was
suddenly
aware
of
a
sharp
cramp
in
my
left
leg
i
tried
to
get
at
it
to
rub
it
with
my
single
arm
but
finding
myself
too
weak
hailed
an
attendant
just
rub
my
left
calf
said
i
if
you
calf
said
he
you
ain
t
none
it
s
took
i
know
better
said
i
i
have
pain
in
both
wall
i
never
said
he
you
ain
t
got
nary
as
i
did
not
believe
him
he
threw
off
the
covers
and
to
my
horror
showed
me
that
i
had
suffered
amputation
of
both
thighs
very
high
up
that
will
do
said
i
faintly
a
month
later
to
the
amazement
of
every
one
i
was
so
well
as
to
be
moved
from
the
crowded
hospital
at
chattanooga
to
nashville
where
i
filled
one
of
the
ten
thousand
beds
of
that
vast
metropolis
of
hospitals
of
the
sufferings
which
then
began
i
shall
presently
speak
it
will
be
best
just
now
to
detail
the
final
misfortune
which
here
fell
upon
me
hospital
no
in
which
i
lay
was
inconveniently
crowded
with
severely
wounded
officers
after
my
third
week
an
epidemic
of
hospital
gangrene
broke
out
in
my
ward
in
three
days
it
attacked
twenty
persons
then
an
inspector
came
and
we
were
transferred
at
once
to
the
open
air
and
placed
in
tents
strangely
enough
the
wound
in
my
remaining
arm
which
still
suppurated
was
seized
with
gangrene
the
usual
remedy
bromine
was
used
locally
but
the
main
artery
opened
was
tied
bled
again
and
again
and
at
last
as
a
final
resort
the
remaining
arm
was
amputated
at
the
against
all
chances
i
recovered
to
find
myself
a
useless
torso
more
like
some
strange
larval
creature
than
anything
of
human
shape
of
my
anguish
and
horror
of
myself
i
dare
not
speak
i
have
dictated
these
pages
not
to
shock
my
readers
but
to
possess
them
with
facts
in
regard
to
the
relation
of
the
mind
to
the
body
and
i
hasten
therefore
to
such
portions
of
my
case
as
best
illustrate
these
views
in
january
i
was
forwarded
to
philadelphia
in
order
to
enter
what
was
known
as
the
stump
hospital
south
street
then
in
charge
of
hopkinson
this
favor
was
obtained
through
the
influence
of
my
father
s
friend
the
late
governor
anderson
who
has
always
manifested
an
interest
in
my
case
for
which
i
am
deeply
grateful
it
was
thought
at
the
time
that
palmer
the
might
be
able
to
adapt
some
form
of
arm
to
my
left
shoulder
as
on
that
side
there
remained
five
inches
of
the
which
i
could
move
to
a
moderate
extent
the
hope
proved
illusory
as
the
stump
was
always
too
tender
to
bear
any
pressure
the
hospital
referred
to
was
in
charge
of
several
surgeons
while
i
was
an
inmate
and
was
at
all
times
a
clean
and
pleasant
home
it
was
filled
with
men
who
had
lost
one
arm
or
leg
or
one
of
each
as
happened
now
and
then
i
saw
one
man
who
had
lost
both
legs
and
one
who
had
parted
with
both
arms
but
none
like
myself
stripped
of
every
limb
there
were
collected
in
this
place
hundreds
of
these
cases
which
gave
to
it
with
reason
enough
the
not
very
pleasing
title
of
stump
hospital
i
spent
here
three
and
a
half
months
before
my
transfer
to
the
united
states
army
hospital
for
injuries
and
diseases
of
the
nervous
system
every
morning
i
was
carried
out
in
an
and
placed
in
the
library
where
some
one
was
always
ready
to
write
or
read
for
me
or
to
fill
my
pipe
the
doctors
lent
me
medical
books
the
ladies
brought
me
luxuries
and
fed
me
and
save
that
i
was
helpless
to
a
degree
which
was
humiliating
i
was
as
comfortable
as
kindness
could
make
me
i
amused
myself
at
this
time
by
noting
in
my
mind
all
that
i
could
learn
from
other
limbless
folk
and
from
myself
as
to
the
peculiar
feelings
which
were
noticed
in
regard
to
lost
members
i
found
that
the
great
mass
of
men
who
had
undergone
amputations
for
many
months
felt
the
usual
consciousness
that
they
still
had
the
lost
limb
it
itched
or
pained
or
was
cramped
but
never
felt
hot
or
cold
if
they
had
painful
sensations
referred
to
it
the
conviction
of
its
existence
continued
unaltered
for
long
periods
but
where
no
pain
was
felt
in
it
then
by
degrees
the
sense
of
having
that
limb
faded
away
entirely
i
think
we
may
to
some
extent
explain
this
the
knowledge
we
possess
of
any
part
is
made
up
of
the
numberless
impressions
from
without
which
affect
its
sensitive
surfaces
and
which
are
transmitted
through
its
nerves
to
the
spinal
and
through
them
again
to
the
brain
we
are
thus
kept
endlessly
informed
as
to
the
existence
of
parts
because
the
impressions
which
reach
the
brain
are
by
a
law
of
our
being
referred
by
us
to
the
part
from
which
they
come
now
when
the
part
is
cut
off
the
which
led
to
it
and
from
it
remaining
capable
of
being
impressed
by
irritations
are
made
to
convey
to
the
brain
from
the
stump
impressions
which
are
as
usual
referred
by
the
brain
to
the
lost
parts
to
which
these
belonged
in
other
words
the
nerve
is
like
a
you
may
pull
it
at
any
part
of
its
course
and
thus
ring
the
bell
as
well
as
if
you
pulled
at
the
end
of
the
wire
but
in
any
case
the
intelligent
servant
will
refer
the
pull
to
the
front
door
and
obey
it
accordingly
the
impressions
made
on
the
severed
ends
of
the
nerve
are
due
often
to
changes
in
the
stump
during
healing
and
consequently
cease
when
it
has
healed
so
that
finally
in
a
very
healthy
stump
no
such
impressions
arise
the
brain
ceases
to
correspond
with
the
lost
leg
and
as
les
absents
ont
toujours
tort
it
is
no
longer
remembered
or
recognized
but
in
some
cases
such
as
mine
proved
at
last
to
my
sorrow
the
ends
of
the
nerves
undergo
a
curious
alteration
and
get
to
be
enlarged
and
altered
this
change
as
i
have
seen
in
my
practice
of
medicine
sometimes
passes
up
the
nerves
toward
the
centers
and
occasions
a
more
or
less
constant
irritation
of
the
producing
neuralgia
which
is
usually
referred
by
the
brain
to
that
part
of
the
lost
limb
to
which
the
affected
nerve
belonged
this
pain
keeps
the
brain
ever
mindful
of
the
missing
part
and
imperfectly
at
least
preserves
to
the
man
a
consciousness
of
possessing
that
which
he
has
not
where
the
pains
come
and
go
as
they
do
in
certain
cases
the
subjective
sensations
thus
occasioned
are
very
curious
since
in
such
cases
the
man
loses
and
gains
and
loses
and
regains
the
consciousness
of
the
presence
of
the
lost
parts
so
that
he
will
tell
you
now
i
feel
my
thumb
now
i
feel
my
little
i
should
also
add
that
nearly
every
person
who
has
lost
an
arm
above
the
elbow
feels
as
though
the
lost
member
were
bent
at
the
elbow
and
at
times
is
vividly
impressed
with
the
notion
that
his
fingers
are
strongly
flexed
other
persons
present
a
peculiarity
which
i
am
at
a
loss
to
account
for
where
the
leg
for
instance
has
been
lost
they
feel
as
if
the
foot
were
present
but
as
though
the
leg
were
shortened
thus
if
the
thigh
has
been
taken
off
there
seems
to
them
to
be
a
foot
at
the
knee
if
the
arm
a
hand
seems
to
be
at
the
elbow
or
attached
to
the
stump
itself
before
leaving
nashville
i
had
begun
to
suffer
the
most
acute
pain
in
my
left
hand
especially
the
little
finger
and
so
perfect
was
the
idea
which
was
thus
kept
up
of
the
real
presence
of
these
missing
parts
that
i
found
it
hard
at
times
to
believe
them
absent
often
at
night
i
would
try
with
one
lost
hand
to
grope
for
the
other
as
however
i
had
no
pain
in
the
right
arm
the
sense
of
the
existence
of
that
limb
gradually
disappeared
as
did
that
of
my
legs
also
everything
was
done
for
my
neuralgia
which
the
doctors
could
think
of
and
at
length
at
my
suggestion
i
was
removed
as
i
have
said
from
the
stump
hospital
to
the
united
states
army
hospital
for
injuries
and
diseases
of
the
nervous
system
it
was
a
pleasant
suburban
its
gardens
surrounded
by
a
circle
of
wooden
wards
shaded
by
fine
trees
there
were
some
three
hundred
cases
of
epilepsy
paralysis
vitus
s
dance
and
wounds
of
nerves
on
one
side
of
me
lay
a
poor
fellow
a
dane
who
had
the
same
burning
neuralgia
with
which
i
once
suffered
and
which
i
now
learned
was
only
too
common
this
man
had
become
hysterical
from
pain
he
carried
a
sponge
in
his
pocket
and
a
bottle
of
water
in
one
hand
with
which
he
constantly
wetted
the
burning
hand
every
sound
increased
his
torture
and
he
even
poured
water
into
his
boots
to
keep
himself
from
feeling
too
sensibly
the
rough
friction
of
his
soles
when
walking
like
him
i
was
greatly
eased
by
having
small
doses
of
morphia
injected
under
the
skin
of
my
shoulder
with
a
hollow
needle
fitted
to
a
syringe
as
i
improved
under
the
morphia
treatment
i
began
to
be
disturbed
by
the
horrible
variety
of
suffering
about
me
one
man
walked
sideways
there
was
one
who
could
not
smell
another
was
dumb
from
an
explosion
in
fact
every
one
had
his
own
abnormal
peculiarity
near
me
was
a
strange
case
of
palsy
of
the
muscles
called
rhomboids
whose
office
it
is
to
hold
down
the
flat
on
the
back
during
the
motions
of
the
arms
which
in
themselves
were
strong
enough
when
however
he
lifted
these
members
the
stood
out
from
the
back
like
wings
and
got
him
the
sobriquet
of
the
in
my
ward
were
also
the
cases
of
fits
which
very
much
annoyed
me
as
upon
any
great
change
in
the
weather
it
was
common
to
have
a
dozen
convulsions
in
view
at
once
neek
one
of
our
physicians
told
me
that
on
one
occasion
a
hundred
and
fifty
fits
took
place
within
hours
on
my
complaining
of
these
sights
whence
i
alone
could
not
fly
i
was
placed
in
the
paralytic
and
wound
ward
which
i
found
much
more
pleasant
a
month
of
skilful
treatment
eased
me
entirely
of
my
aches
and
i
then
began
to
experience
certain
curious
feelings
upon
which
having
nothing
to
do
and
nothing
to
do
anything
with
i
reflected
a
good
deal
it
was
a
good
while
before
i
could
correctly
explain
to
my
own
satisfaction
the
phenomena
which
at
this
time
i
was
called
upon
to
observe
by
the
various
operations
already
described
i
had
lost
about
four
fifths
of
my
weight
as
a
consequence
of
this
i
ate
much
less
than
usual
and
could
scarcely
have
consumed
the
ration
of
a
soldier
i
slept
also
but
little
for
as
sleep
is
the
repose
of
the
brain
made
necessary
by
the
waste
of
its
tissues
during
thought
and
voluntary
movement
and
as
this
latter
did
not
exist
in
my
case
i
needed
only
that
rest
which
was
necessary
to
repair
such
exhaustion
of
the
as
was
induced
by
thinking
and
the
automatic
movements
of
the
viscera
i
observed
at
this
time
also
that
my
heart
in
place
of
beating
as
it
once
did
in
the
minute
pulsated
only
times
in
this
interval
a
fact
to
be
easily
explained
by
the
perfect
quiescence
to
which
i
was
reduced
and
the
consequent
absence
of
that
healthy
and
constant
stimulus
to
the
muscles
of
the
heart
which
exercise
occasions
notwithstanding
these
drawbacks
my
physical
health
was
good
which
i
confess
surprised
me
for
this
among
other
reasons
it
is
said
that
a
burn
of
two
thirds
of
the
surface
destroys
life
because
then
all
the
excretory
matters
which
this
portion
of
the
glands
of
the
skin
evolved
are
thrown
upon
the
blood
and
poison
the
man
just
as
happens
in
an
animal
whose
skin
the
physiologist
has
varnished
so
as
in
this
way
to
destroy
its
function
yet
here
was
i
having
lost
at
least
a
third
of
my
skin
and
apparently
none
the
worse
for
it
still
more
remarkable
however
were
the
psychical
changes
which
i
now
began
to
perceive
i
found
to
my
horror
that
at
times
i
was
less
conscious
of
myself
of
my
own
existence
than
used
to
be
the
case
this
sensation
was
so
novel
that
at
first
it
quite
bewildered
me
i
felt
like
asking
some
one
constantly
if
i
were
really
george
dedlow
or
not
but
well
aware
how
absurd
i
should
seem
after
such
a
question
i
refrained
from
speaking
of
my
case
and
strove
more
keenly
to
analyze
my
feelings
at
times
the
conviction
of
my
want
of
being
myself
was
overwhelming
and
most
painful
it
was
as
well
as
i
can
describe
it
a
deficiency
in
the
egoistic
sentiment
of
individuality
about
one
half
of
the
sensitive
surface
of
my
skin
was
gone
and
thus
much
of
relation
to
the
outer
world
destroyed
as
a
consequence
a
large
part
of
the
receptive
central
organs
must
be
out
of
employ
and
like
other
idle
things
degenerating
rapidly
moreover
all
the
great
central
ganglia
which
give
rise
to
movements
in
the
limbs
were
also
eternally
at
rest
thus
one
half
of
me
was
absent
or
functionally
dead
this
set
me
to
thinking
how
much
a
man
might
lose
and
yet
live
if
i
were
unhappy
enough
to
survive
i
might
part
with
my
spleen
at
least
as
many
a
dog
has
done
and
grown
fat
afterwards
the
other
organs
with
which
we
breathe
and
circulate
the
blood
would
be
essential
so
also
would
the
liver
but
at
least
half
of
the
intestines
might
be
dispensed
with
and
of
course
all
of
the
limbs
and
as
to
the
nervous
system
the
only
parts
really
necessary
to
life
are
a
few
small
ganglia
were
the
rest
absent
or
inactive
we
should
have
a
man
reduced
as
it
were
to
the
lowest
terms
and
leading
an
almost
vegetative
existence
would
such
a
being
i
asked
myself
possess
the
sense
of
individuality
in
its
usual
completeness
even
if
his
organs
of
sensation
remained
and
he
were
capable
of
consciousness
of
course
without
them
he
could
not
have
it
any
more
than
a
dahlia
or
a
tulip
but
with
them
how
then
i
concluded
that
it
would
be
at
a
minimum
and
that
if
utter
loss
of
relation
to
the
outer
world
were
capable
of
destroying
a
man
s
consciousness
of
himself
the
destruction
of
half
of
his
sensitive
surfaces
might
well
occasion
in
a
less
degree
a
like
result
and
so
diminish
his
sense
of
individual
existence
i
thus
reached
the
conclusion
that
a
man
is
not
his
brain
or
any
one
part
of
it
but
all
of
his
economy
and
that
to
lose
any
part
must
lessen
this
sense
of
his
own
existence
i
found
but
one
person
who
properly
appreciated
this
great
truth
she
was
a
new
england
lady
from
hartford
an
agent
i
think
for
some
commission
perhaps
the
sanitary
after
i
had
told
her
my
views
and
feelings
she
said
yes
i
comprehend
the
fractional
entities
of
vitality
are
embraced
in
the
oneness
of
the
unitary
ego
life
she
added
is
the
garnered
condensation
of
objective
impressions
and
as
the
objective
is
the
remote
father
of
the
subjective
so
must
individuality
which
is
but
focused
subjectivity
suffer
and
fade
when
the
sensation
lenses
by
which
the
rays
of
impression
are
condensed
become
i
am
not
quite
clear
that
i
fully
understood
her
but
i
think
she
appreciated
my
ideas
and
i
felt
grateful
for
her
kindly
interest
the
strange
want
i
have
spoken
of
now
haunted
and
perplexed
me
so
constantly
that
i
became
moody
and
wretched
while
in
this
state
a
man
from
a
neighboring
ward
fell
one
morning
into
conversation
with
the
chaplain
within
of
my
chair
some
of
their
words
arrested
my
attention
and
i
turned
my
head
to
see
and
listen
the
speaker
who
wore
a
sergeant
s
chevron
and
carried
one
arm
in
a
sling
was
a
tall
loosely
made
person
with
a
pale
face
light
eyes
of
a
blue
tint
and
very
sparse
yellow
whiskers
his
mouth
was
weak
both
lips
being
almost
alike
so
that
the
organ
might
have
been
turned
upside
down
without
affecting
its
expression
his
forehead
however
was
high
and
thinly
covered
with
sandy
hair
i
should
have
said
as
a
phrenologist
will
feeble
emotional
but
not
passionate
likely
to
be
an
enthusiast
or
a
weakly
bigot
i
caught
enough
of
what
passed
to
make
me
call
to
the
sergeant
when
the
chaplain
left
him
good
morning
said
he
how
do
you
get
on
not
at
all
i
replied
where
were
you
hit
oh
at
chancellorsville
i
was
shot
in
the
shoulder
i
have
what
the
doctors
call
paralysis
of
the
median
nerve
but
i
guess
neek
and
the
lightnin
battery
will
fix
it
when
my
time
s
out
i
ll
go
back
to
kearsarge
and
try
on
the
again
i
ve
done
my
well
said
i
you
re
better
off
than
yes
he
answered
in
more
ways
than
one
i
belong
to
the
new
church
it
s
a
great
comfort
for
a
plain
man
like
me
when
he
s
weary
and
sick
to
be
able
to
turn
away
from
earthly
things
and
hold
converse
daily
with
the
great
and
good
who
have
left
this
here
world
we
have
a
circle
in
coates
street
if
it
wa
n
t
for
the
consoling
i
get
there
i
d
of
wished
myself
dead
many
a
time
i
ain
t
got
kith
or
kin
on
earth
but
this
matters
little
when
one
can
just
talk
to
them
daily
and
know
that
they
are
in
the
spheres
above
it
must
be
a
great
comfort
i
replied
if
only
one
could
believe
believe
he
repeated
how
can
you
help
it
do
you
suppose
anything
dies
no
i
said
the
soul
does
not
i
am
sure
and
as
to
matter
it
merely
changes
but
why
then
said
he
should
not
the
dead
soul
talk
to
the
living
in
space
no
doubt
exist
all
forms
of
matter
merely
in
finer
more
ethereal
being
you
can
t
suppose
a
naked
soul
moving
about
without
a
bodily
garment
no
creed
teaches
that
and
if
its
new
clothing
be
of
like
substance
to
ours
only
of
ethereal
fineness
a
more
delicate
recrystallization
about
the
eternal
spiritual
nucleus
must
it
not
then
possess
powers
as
much
more
delicate
and
refined
as
is
the
new
material
in
which
it
is
reclad
not
very
clear
i
answered
but
after
all
the
thing
should
be
susceptible
of
some
form
of
proof
to
our
present
and
so
it
is
said
he
come
with
me
and
you
shall
see
and
hear
for
i
will
said
i
if
the
doctor
will
lend
me
the
it
was
so
arranged
as
the
surgeon
in
charge
was
kind
enough
as
usual
to
oblige
me
with
the
loan
of
his
wagon
and
two
orderlies
to
lift
my
useless
trunk
on
the
day
following
i
found
myself
with
my
new
comrade
in
a
house
in
coates
street
where
a
circle
was
in
the
daily
habit
of
meeting
so
soon
as
i
had
been
comfortably
deposited
in
an
beside
a
large
pine
table
the
rest
of
those
assembled
seated
themselves
and
for
some
time
preserved
an
unbroken
silence
during
this
pause
i
scrutinized
the
persons
present
next
to
me
on
my
right
sat
a
flabby
man
with
baggy
features
and
injected
eyes
he
was
as
i
learned
afterwards
an
eclectic
doctor
who
had
tried
his
hand
at
medicine
and
several
of
its
quackish
variations
finally
settling
down
on
eclecticism
which
i
believe
professes
to
be
to
scientific
medicine
what
vegetarianism
is
to
dietetics
next
to
him
sat
a
i
think
of
two
somewhat
feeble
novels
and
much
pleasanter
to
look
at
than
her
books
she
was
i
thought
a
good
deal
excited
at
the
prospect
of
spiritual
revelations
her
neighbor
was
a
pallid
young
woman
with
very
red
lips
and
large
brown
eyes
of
great
beauty
she
was
as
i
learned
afterwards
a
magnetic
patient
of
the
doctor
and
had
deserted
her
husband
a
master
mechanic
to
follow
this
new
light
the
others
were
like
myself
strangers
brought
hither
by
mere
curiosity
one
of
them
was
a
lady
in
deep
black
closely
veiled
beyond
her
and
opposite
to
me
sat
the
sergeant
and
next
to
him
the
medium
a
man
named
brink
he
wore
a
good
deal
of
jewelry
and
had
large
black
a
man
formed
by
nature
to
appreciate
the
pleasant
things
of
sensual
existence
before
i
had
ended
my
survey
he
turned
to
the
lady
in
black
and
asked
if
she
wished
to
see
any
one
in
the
she
said
yes
rather
feebly
is
the
spirit
present
he
asked
upon
which
two
knocks
were
heard
in
affirmation
ah
said
the
medium
the
name
is
it
is
the
name
of
a
child
it
is
a
male
child
it
is
alfred
she
cried
great
heaven
my
child
my
boy
on
this
the
medium
arose
and
became
strangely
convulsed
i
see
he
said
i
see
a
boy
i
see
blue
eyes
i
see
above
you
beyond
you
at
the
same
time
pointing
fixedly
over
her
head
she
turned
with
a
wild
start
where
whereabouts
a
boy
he
continued
over
your
head
he
cries
he
says
mama
mama
the
effect
of
this
on
the
woman
was
unpleasant
she
stared
about
her
for
a
moment
and
exclaiming
i
come
i
am
coming
alfy
fell
in
hysterics
on
the
floor
two
or
three
persons
raised
her
and
aided
her
into
an
adjoining
room
but
the
rest
remained
at
the
table
as
though
well
accustomed
to
like
scenes
after
this
several
of
the
strangers
were
called
upon
to
write
the
names
of
the
dead
with
whom
they
wished
to
communicate
the
names
were
spelled
out
by
the
agency
of
affirmative
knocks
when
the
correct
letters
were
touched
by
the
applicant
who
was
furnished
with
an
upon
which
he
tapped
the
letters
in
turn
the
medium
meanwhile
scanning
his
face
very
keenly
with
some
the
names
were
readily
made
out
with
one
a
stolid
personage
of
disbelieving
type
every
attempt
failed
until
at
last
the
spirits
signified
by
knocks
that
he
was
a
disturbing
agency
and
that
while
he
remained
all
our
efforts
would
fail
upon
this
some
of
the
company
proposed
that
he
should
leave
of
which
invitation
he
took
advantage
with
a
skeptical
sneer
at
the
whole
performance
as
he
left
us
the
sergeant
leaned
over
and
whispered
to
the
medium
who
next
addressed
himself
to
me
sister
euphemia
he
said
indicating
the
lady
with
large
eyes
will
act
as
your
medium
i
am
unable
to
do
more
these
things
exhaust
my
nervous
sister
euphemia
said
the
doctor
will
aid
us
think
if
you
please
sir
of
a
spirit
and
she
will
endeavor
to
summon
it
to
our
upon
this
a
wild
idea
came
into
my
head
i
answered
i
am
thinking
as
you
directed
me
to
the
medium
sat
with
her
arms
folded
looking
steadily
at
the
center
of
the
table
for
a
few
moments
there
was
silence
then
a
series
of
irregular
knocks
began
are
you
present
said
the
medium
the
affirmative
raps
were
twice
given
i
should
think
said
the
doctor
that
there
were
two
spirits
his
words
sent
a
thrill
through
my
heart
are
there
two
he
questioned
a
double
rap
yes
two
said
the
medium
will
it
please
the
spirits
to
make
us
conscious
of
their
names
in
this
world
a
single
knock
will
it
please
them
to
say
how
they
are
called
in
the
world
of
spirits
again
came
the
irregular
raps
then
a
pause
and
i
think
said
the
authoress
they
must
be
numbers
will
the
spirits
she
said
be
good
enough
to
aid
us
shall
we
use
the
alphabet
yes
was
rapped
very
quickly
are
these
numbers
yes
again
i
will
write
them
she
added
and
doing
so
took
up
the
card
and
tapped
the
letters
the
spelling
was
pretty
rapid
and
ran
thus
as
she
tapped
in
turn
first
the
letters
and
last
the
numbers
she
had
already
set
down
united
states
army
medical
museum
nos
the
medium
looked
up
with
a
puzzled
expression
good
gracious
said
i
they
are
my
legs
my
legs
what
followed
i
ask
no
one
to
believe
except
those
who
like
myself
have
communed
with
the
things
of
another
sphere
suddenly
i
felt
a
strange
return
of
my
i
was
reindividualized
so
to
speak
a
strange
wonder
filled
me
and
to
the
amazement
of
every
one
i
arose
and
staggering
a
little
walked
across
the
room
on
limbs
invisible
to
them
or
me
it
was
no
wonder
i
staggered
for
as
i
briefly
reflected
my
legs
had
been
nine
months
in
the
strongest
alcohol
at
this
instant
all
my
new
friends
crowded
around
me
in
astonishment
presently
however
i
felt
myself
sinking
slowly
my
legs
were
going
and
in
a
moment
i
was
resting
feebly
on
my
two
stumps
upon
the
floor
it
was
too
much
all
that
was
left
of
me
fainted
and
rolled
over
senseless
i
have
little
to
add
i
am
now
at
home
in
the
west
surrounded
by
every
form
of
kindness
and
every
possible
comfort
but
alas
i
have
so
little
surety
of
being
myself
that
i
doubt
my
own
honesty
in
drawing
my
pension
and
feel
absolved
from
gratitude
to
those
who
are
kind
to
a
being
who
is
uncertain
of
being
enough
himself
to
be
conscientiously
responsible
it
is
needless
to
add
that
i
am
not
a
happy
fraction
of
a
man
and
that
i
am
eager
for
the
day
when
i
shall
rejoin
the
lost
members
of
my
corporeal
family
in
another
and
a
happier
world
