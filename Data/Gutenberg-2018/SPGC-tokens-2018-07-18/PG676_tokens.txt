the
battle
of
life
chapter
i
part
the
first
once
upon
a
time
it
matters
little
when
and
in
stalwart
england
it
matters
little
where
a
fierce
battle
was
fought
it
was
fought
upon
a
long
summer
day
when
the
waving
grass
was
green
many
a
wild
flower
formed
by
the
almighty
hand
to
be
a
perfumed
goblet
for
the
dew
felt
its
enamelled
cup
filled
high
with
blood
that
day
and
shrinking
dropped
many
an
insect
deriving
its
delicate
colour
from
harmless
leaves
and
herbs
was
stained
anew
that
day
by
dying
men
and
marked
its
frightened
way
with
an
unnatural
track
the
painted
butterfly
took
blood
into
the
air
upon
the
edges
of
its
wings
the
stream
ran
red
the
trodden
ground
became
a
quagmire
whence
from
sullen
pools
collected
in
the
prints
of
human
feet
and
horses
hoofs
the
one
prevailing
hue
still
lowered
and
glimmered
at
the
sun
heaven
keep
us
from
a
knowledge
of
the
sights
the
moon
beheld
upon
that
field
when
coming
up
above
the
black
line
of
distant
ground
softened
and
blurred
at
the
edge
by
trees
she
rose
into
the
sky
and
looked
upon
the
plain
strewn
with
upturned
faces
that
had
once
at
mothers
breasts
sought
mothers
eyes
or
slumbered
happily
heaven
keep
us
from
a
knowledge
of
the
secrets
whispered
afterwards
upon
the
tainted
wind
that
blew
across
the
scene
of
that
day
work
and
that
night
death
and
suffering
many
a
lonely
moon
was
bright
upon
the
and
many
a
star
kept
mournful
watch
upon
it
and
many
a
wind
from
every
quarter
of
the
earth
blew
over
it
before
the
traces
of
the
fight
were
worn
away
they
lurked
and
lingered
for
a
long
time
but
survived
in
little
things
for
nature
far
above
the
evil
passions
of
men
soon
recovered
her
serenity
and
smiled
upon
the
guilty
as
she
had
done
before
when
it
was
innocent
the
larks
sang
high
above
it
the
swallows
skimmed
and
dipped
and
flitted
to
and
fro
the
shadows
of
the
flying
clouds
pursued
each
other
swiftly
over
grass
and
corn
and
and
wood
and
over
roof
and
spire
in
the
nestling
town
among
the
trees
away
into
the
bright
distance
on
the
borders
of
the
sky
and
earth
where
the
red
sunsets
faded
crops
were
sown
and
grew
up
and
were
gathered
in
the
stream
that
had
been
crimsoned
turned
a
watermill
men
whistled
at
the
plough
gleaners
and
haymakers
were
seen
in
quiet
groups
at
work
sheep
and
oxen
pastured
boys
whooped
and
called
in
fields
to
scare
away
the
birds
smoke
rose
from
cottage
chimneys
sabbath
bells
rang
peacefully
old
people
lived
and
died
the
timid
creatures
of
the
field
and
simple
flowers
of
the
bush
and
garden
grew
and
withered
in
their
destined
terms
and
all
upon
the
fierce
and
bloody
where
thousands
upon
thousands
had
been
killed
in
the
great
fight
but
there
were
deep
green
patches
in
the
growing
corn
at
first
that
people
looked
at
awfully
year
after
year
they
and
it
was
known
that
underneath
those
fertile
spots
heaps
of
men
and
horses
lay
buried
indiscriminately
enriching
the
ground
the
husbandmen
who
ploughed
those
places
shrunk
from
the
great
worms
abounding
there
and
the
sheaves
they
yielded
were
for
many
a
long
year
called
the
battle
sheaves
and
set
apart
and
no
one
ever
knew
a
battle
sheaf
to
be
among
the
last
load
at
a
harvest
home
for
a
long
time
every
furrow
that
was
turned
revealed
some
fragments
of
the
fight
for
a
long
time
there
were
wounded
trees
upon
the
ground
and
scraps
of
hacked
and
broken
fence
and
wall
where
deadly
struggles
had
been
made
and
trampled
parts
where
not
a
leaf
or
blade
would
grow
for
a
long
time
no
village
girl
would
dress
her
hair
or
bosom
with
the
sweetest
flower
from
that
field
of
death
and
after
many
a
year
had
come
and
gone
the
berries
growing
there
were
still
believed
to
leave
too
deep
a
stain
upon
the
hand
that
plucked
them
the
seasons
in
their
course
however
though
they
passed
as
lightly
as
the
summer
clouds
themselves
obliterated
in
the
lapse
of
time
even
these
remains
of
the
old
conflict
and
wore
away
such
legendary
traces
of
it
as
the
neighbouring
people
carried
in
their
minds
until
they
dwindled
into
old
wives
tales
dimly
remembered
round
the
winter
fire
and
waning
every
year
where
the
wild
flowers
and
berries
had
so
long
remained
upon
the
stem
untouched
gardens
arose
and
houses
were
built
and
children
played
at
battles
on
the
turf
the
wounded
trees
had
long
ago
made
christmas
logs
and
blazed
and
roared
away
the
deep
green
patches
were
no
greener
now
than
the
memory
of
those
who
lay
in
dust
below
the
ploughshare
still
turned
up
from
time
to
time
some
rusty
bits
of
metal
but
it
was
hard
to
say
what
use
they
had
ever
served
and
those
who
found
them
wondered
and
disputed
an
old
dinted
corselet
and
a
helmet
had
been
hanging
in
the
church
so
long
that
the
same
weak
old
man
who
tried
in
vain
to
make
them
out
above
the
whitewashed
arch
had
marvelled
at
them
as
a
baby
if
the
host
slain
upon
the
field
could
have
been
for
a
moment
reanimated
in
the
forms
in
which
they
fell
each
upon
the
spot
that
was
the
bed
of
his
untimely
death
gashed
and
ghastly
soldiers
would
have
stared
in
hundreds
deep
at
household
door
and
window
and
would
have
risen
on
the
hearths
of
quiet
homes
and
would
have
been
the
garnered
store
of
barns
and
granaries
and
would
have
started
up
between
the
cradled
infant
and
its
nurse
and
would
have
floated
with
the
stream
and
whirled
round
on
the
mill
and
crowded
the
orchard
and
burdened
the
meadow
and
piled
the
rickyard
high
with
dying
men
so
altered
was
the
where
thousands
upon
thousands
had
been
killed
in
the
great
fight
nowhere
more
altered
perhaps
about
a
hundred
years
ago
than
in
one
little
orchard
attached
to
an
old
stone
house
with
a
honeysuckle
porch
where
on
a
bright
autumn
morning
there
were
sounds
of
music
and
laughter
and
where
two
girls
danced
merrily
together
on
the
grass
while
some
peasant
women
standing
on
ladders
gathering
the
apples
from
the
trees
stopped
in
their
work
to
look
down
and
share
their
enjoyment
it
was
a
pleasant
lively
natural
scene
a
beautiful
day
a
retired
spot
and
the
two
girls
quite
unconstrained
and
careless
danced
in
the
freedom
and
gaiety
of
their
hearts
if
there
were
no
such
thing
as
display
in
the
world
my
private
opinion
is
and
i
hope
you
agree
with
me
that
we
might
get
on
a
great
deal
better
than
we
do
and
might
be
infinitely
more
agreeable
company
than
we
are
it
was
charming
to
see
how
these
girls
danced
they
had
no
spectators
but
the
on
the
ladders
they
were
very
glad
to
please
them
but
they
danced
to
please
themselves
or
at
least
you
would
have
supposed
so
and
you
could
no
more
help
admiring
than
they
could
help
dancing
how
they
did
dance
not
like
not
at
all
and
not
like
madame
finished
pupils
not
the
least
it
was
not
quadrille
dancing
nor
minuet
dancing
nor
even
dancing
it
was
neither
in
the
old
style
nor
the
new
style
nor
the
french
style
nor
the
english
style
though
it
may
have
been
by
accident
a
trifle
in
the
spanish
style
which
is
a
free
and
joyous
one
i
am
told
deriving
a
delightful
air
of
inspiration
from
the
chirping
little
castanets
as
they
danced
among
the
orchard
trees
and
down
the
groves
of
stems
and
back
again
and
twirled
each
other
lightly
round
and
round
the
influence
of
their
airy
motion
seemed
to
spread
and
spread
in
the
scene
like
an
expanding
circle
in
the
water
their
streaming
hair
and
fluttering
skirts
the
elastic
grass
beneath
their
feet
the
boughs
that
rustled
in
the
morning
air
the
flashing
leaves
the
speckled
shadows
on
the
soft
green
ground
the
balmy
wind
that
swept
along
the
landscape
glad
to
turn
the
distant
windmill
cheerily
everything
between
the
two
girls
and
the
man
and
team
at
plough
upon
the
ridge
of
land
where
they
showed
against
the
sky
as
if
they
were
the
last
things
in
the
world
seemed
dancing
too
at
last
the
younger
of
the
dancing
sisters
out
of
breath
and
laughing
gaily
threw
herself
upon
a
bench
to
rest
the
other
leaned
against
a
tree
hard
by
the
music
a
wandering
harp
and
fiddle
left
off
with
a
flourish
as
if
it
boasted
of
its
freshness
though
the
truth
is
it
had
gone
at
such
a
pace
and
worked
itself
to
such
a
pitch
of
competition
with
the
dancing
that
it
never
could
have
held
on
half
a
minute
longer
the
pickers
on
the
ladders
raised
a
hum
and
murmur
of
applause
and
then
in
keeping
with
the
sound
bestirred
themselves
to
work
again
like
bees
the
more
actively
perhaps
because
an
elderly
gentleman
who
was
no
other
than
doctor
jeddler
himself
it
was
doctor
house
and
orchard
you
should
know
and
these
were
doctor
daughters
came
bustling
out
to
see
what
was
the
matter
and
who
the
deuce
played
music
on
his
property
before
breakfast
for
he
was
a
great
philosopher
doctor
jeddler
and
not
very
musical
and
dancing
said
the
doctor
stopping
short
and
speaking
to
himself
thought
they
dreaded
but
it
a
world
of
contradictions
why
grace
why
marion
he
added
aloud
the
world
more
mad
than
usual
this
morning
some
allowance
for
it
father
if
it
be
replied
his
younger
daughter
marion
going
close
to
him
and
looking
into
his
face
it
somebody
puss
replied
the
doctor
you
know
it
always
somebody
did
you
never
hear
how
many
new
performers
enter
on
this
ha
ha
ha
it
impossible
to
speak
gravely
of
it
on
this
preposterous
and
ridiculous
business
called
life
every
minute
father
not
you
of
course
you
a
woman
almost
said
the
doctor
and
he
looked
into
the
pretty
face
still
close
to
his
suppose
it
your
do
you
really
father
cried
his
pet
daughter
pursing
up
her
red
lips
to
be
kissed
take
my
love
with
it
said
the
doctor
imprinting
his
upon
them
many
happy
returns
of
the
the
idea
of
the
day
the
notion
of
wishing
happy
returns
in
such
a
farce
as
this
said
the
doctor
to
himself
good
ha
ha
ha
doctor
jeddler
was
as
i
have
said
a
great
philosopher
and
the
heart
and
mystery
of
his
philosophy
was
to
look
upon
the
world
as
a
gigantic
practical
joke
as
something
too
absurd
to
be
considered
seriously
by
any
rational
man
his
system
of
belief
had
been
in
the
beginning
part
and
parcel
of
the
on
which
he
lived
as
you
shall
presently
understand
but
how
did
you
get
the
music
asked
the
doctor
of
course
where
did
the
minstrels
come
from
sent
the
music
said
his
daughter
grace
adjusting
a
few
simple
flowers
in
her
sister
hair
with
which
in
her
admiration
of
that
youthful
beauty
she
had
herself
adorned
it
before
and
which
the
dancing
had
disarranged
alfred
sent
the
music
did
he
returned
the
doctor
he
met
it
coming
out
of
the
town
as
he
was
entering
early
the
men
are
travelling
on
foot
and
rested
there
last
night
and
as
it
was
marion
and
he
thought
it
would
please
her
he
sent
them
on
with
a
pencilled
note
to
me
saying
that
if
i
thought
so
too
they
had
come
to
serenade
her
ay
said
the
doctor
carelessly
always
takes
your
opinion
my
opinion
being
favourable
said
grace
and
pausing
for
a
moment
to
admire
the
pretty
head
she
decorated
with
her
own
thrown
back
marion
being
in
high
spirits
and
beginning
to
dance
i
joined
her
and
so
we
danced
to
music
till
we
were
out
of
breath
and
we
thought
the
music
all
the
gayer
for
being
sent
by
alfred
did
we
dear
marion
i
do
know
grace
how
you
tease
me
about
alfred
you
by
mentioning
your
lover
said
her
sister
am
sure
i
do
much
care
to
have
him
mentioned
said
the
wilful
beauty
stripping
the
petals
from
some
flowers
she
held
and
scattering
them
on
the
ground
am
almost
tired
of
hearing
of
him
and
as
to
his
being
my
lover
do
speak
lightly
of
a
true
heart
which
is
all
your
own
marion
cried
her
sister
in
jest
there
is
not
a
truer
heart
than
alfred
in
the
world
said
marion
raising
her
eyebrows
with
a
pleasant
air
of
careless
consideration
not
but
i
do
know
that
there
any
great
merit
in
that
i
i
do
want
him
to
be
so
very
true
i
never
asked
him
if
he
expects
that
i
but
dear
grace
why
need
we
talk
of
him
at
all
just
now
it
was
agreeable
to
see
the
graceful
figures
of
the
blooming
sisters
twined
together
lingering
among
the
trees
conversing
thus
with
earnestness
opposed
to
lightness
yet
with
love
responding
tenderly
to
love
and
it
was
very
curious
indeed
to
see
the
younger
sister
eyes
suffused
with
tears
and
something
fervently
and
deeply
felt
breaking
through
the
wilfulness
of
what
she
said
and
striving
with
it
painfully
the
difference
between
them
in
respect
of
age
could
not
exceed
four
years
at
most
but
grace
as
often
happens
in
such
cases
when
no
mother
watches
over
both
the
doctor
wife
was
dead
seemed
in
her
gentle
care
of
her
young
sister
and
in
the
steadiness
of
her
devotion
to
her
older
than
she
was
and
more
removed
in
course
of
nature
from
all
competition
with
her
or
participation
otherwise
than
through
her
sympathy
and
true
affection
in
her
wayward
fancies
than
their
ages
seemed
to
warrant
great
character
of
mother
that
even
in
this
shadow
and
faint
reflection
of
it
purifies
the
heart
and
raises
the
exalted
nature
nearer
to
the
angels
the
doctor
reflections
as
he
looked
after
them
and
heard
the
purport
of
their
discourse
were
limited
at
first
to
certain
merry
meditations
on
the
folly
of
all
loves
and
likings
and
the
idle
imposition
practised
on
themselves
by
young
people
who
believed
for
a
moment
that
there
could
be
anything
serious
in
such
bubbles
and
were
always
undeceived
always
but
the
qualities
of
grace
and
her
sweet
temper
so
gentle
and
retiring
yet
including
so
much
constancy
and
bravery
of
spirit
seemed
all
expressed
to
him
in
the
contrast
between
her
quiet
household
figure
and
that
of
his
younger
and
more
beautiful
child
and
he
was
sorry
for
her
sake
sorry
for
them
both
that
life
should
be
such
a
very
ridiculous
business
as
it
was
the
doctor
never
dreamed
of
inquiring
whether
his
children
or
either
of
them
helped
in
any
way
to
make
the
scheme
a
serious
one
but
then
he
was
a
philosopher
a
kind
and
generous
man
by
nature
he
had
stumbled
by
chance
over
that
common
philosopher
stone
much
more
easily
discovered
than
the
object
of
the
alchemist
researches
which
sometimes
trips
up
kind
and
generous
men
and
has
the
fatal
property
of
turning
gold
to
dross
and
every
precious
thing
to
poor
account
cried
the
doctor
halloa
a
small
man
with
an
uncommonly
sour
and
discontented
face
emerged
from
the
house
and
returned
to
this
call
the
unceremonious
acknowledgment
of
then
the
breakfast
table
said
the
doctor
the
house
returned
britain
you
going
to
spread
it
out
here
as
you
were
told
last
night
said
the
doctor
you
know
that
there
are
gentlemen
coming
that
there
business
to
be
done
this
morning
before
the
coach
comes
by
that
this
is
a
very
particular
occasion
could
do
anything
jeddler
till
the
women
had
done
getting
in
the
apples
could
i
said
britain
his
voice
rising
with
his
reasoning
so
that
it
was
very
loud
at
last
have
they
done
now
replied
the
doctor
looking
at
his
watch
and
clapping
his
hands
make
haste
clemency
am
i
mister
said
a
voice
from
one
of
the
ladders
which
a
pair
of
clumsy
feet
descended
briskly
all
done
now
clear
away
gals
everything
shall
be
ready
for
you
in
half
a
minute
mister
with
that
she
began
to
bustle
about
most
vigorously
presenting
as
she
did
so
an
appearance
sufficiently
peculiar
to
justify
a
word
of
introduction
she
was
about
thirty
years
old
and
had
a
sufficiently
plump
and
cheerful
face
though
it
was
twisted
up
into
an
odd
expression
of
tightness
that
made
it
comical
but
the
extraordinary
homeliness
of
her
gait
and
manner
would
have
superseded
any
face
in
the
world
to
say
that
she
had
two
left
legs
and
somebody
arms
and
that
all
four
limbs
seemed
to
be
out
of
joint
and
to
start
from
perfectly
wrong
places
when
they
were
set
in
motion
is
to
offer
the
mildest
outline
of
the
reality
to
say
that
she
was
perfectly
content
and
satisfied
with
these
arrangements
and
regarded
them
as
being
no
business
of
hers
and
that
she
took
her
arms
and
legs
as
they
came
and
allowed
them
to
dispose
of
themselves
just
as
it
happened
is
to
render
faint
justice
to
her
equanimity
her
dress
was
a
prodigious
pair
of
shoes
that
never
wanted
to
go
where
her
feet
went
blue
stockings
a
printed
gown
of
many
colours
and
the
most
hideous
pattern
procurable
for
money
and
a
white
apron
she
always
wore
short
sleeves
and
always
had
by
some
accident
grazed
elbows
in
which
she
took
so
lively
an
interest
that
she
was
continually
trying
to
turn
them
round
and
get
impossible
views
of
them
in
general
a
little
cap
placed
somewhere
on
her
head
though
it
was
rarely
to
be
met
with
in
the
place
usually
occupied
in
other
subjects
by
that
article
of
dress
but
from
head
to
foot
she
was
scrupulously
clean
and
maintained
a
kind
of
dislocated
tidiness
indeed
her
laudable
anxiety
to
be
tidy
and
compact
in
her
own
conscience
as
well
as
in
the
public
eye
gave
rise
to
one
of
her
most
startling
evolutions
which
was
to
grasp
herself
sometimes
by
a
sort
of
wooden
handle
part
of
her
clothing
and
familiarly
called
a
busk
and
wrestle
as
it
were
with
her
garments
until
they
fell
into
a
symmetrical
arrangement
such
in
outward
form
and
garb
was
clemency
newcome
who
was
supposed
to
have
unconsciously
originated
a
corruption
of
her
own
christian
name
from
clementina
but
nobody
knew
for
the
deaf
old
mother
a
very
phenomenon
of
age
whom
she
had
supported
almost
from
a
child
was
dead
and
she
had
no
other
relation
who
now
busied
herself
in
preparing
the
table
and
who
stood
at
intervals
with
her
bare
red
arms
crossed
rubbing
her
grazed
elbows
with
opposite
hands
and
staring
at
it
very
composedly
until
she
suddenly
remembered
something
else
she
wanted
and
jogged
off
to
fetch
it
are
them
two
lawyers
mister
said
clemency
in
a
tone
of
no
very
great
cried
the
doctor
advancing
to
the
gate
to
meet
them
morning
good
morning
grace
my
dear
marion
here
are
snitchey
and
craggs
where
alfred
be
back
directly
father
no
doubt
said
grace
had
so
much
to
do
this
morning
in
his
preparations
for
departure
that
he
was
up
and
out
by
daybreak
good
morning
gentlemen
said
snitchey
self
and
craggs
who
bowed
morning
miss
to
marion
kiss
your
hand
which
he
did
i
wish
you
which
he
might
or
might
not
for
he
look
at
first
sight
like
a
gentleman
troubled
with
many
warm
outpourings
of
soul
in
behalf
of
other
people
hundred
happy
returns
of
this
auspicious
day
ha
ha
laughed
the
doctor
thoughtfully
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
great
farce
in
a
hundred
acts
would
i
am
sure
said
snitchey
standing
a
small
professional
blue
bag
against
one
leg
of
the
table
the
great
farce
short
for
this
actress
at
all
events
doctor
jeddler
returned
the
doctor
forbid
may
she
live
to
laugh
at
it
as
long
as
she
can
laugh
and
then
say
with
the
french
wit
the
farce
is
ended
draw
the
curtain
french
wit
said
snitchey
peeping
sharply
into
his
blue
bag
wrong
doctor
jeddler
and
your
philosophy
is
altogether
wrong
depend
upon
it
as
i
have
often
told
you
nothing
serious
in
life
what
do
you
call
law
joke
replied
the
doctor
you
ever
go
to
law
asked
snitchey
looking
out
of
the
blue
bag
returned
the
doctor
you
ever
do
said
snitchey
you
alter
that
opinion
craggs
who
seemed
to
be
represented
by
snitchey
and
to
be
conscious
of
little
or
no
separate
existence
or
personal
individuality
offered
a
remark
of
his
own
in
this
place
it
involved
the
only
idea
of
which
he
did
not
stand
seized
and
possessed
in
equal
moieties
with
snitchey
but
he
had
some
partners
in
it
among
the
wise
men
of
the
world
made
a
great
deal
too
easy
said
craggs
is
asked
the
doctor
said
craggs
is
everything
appears
to
me
to
be
made
too
easy
it
the
vice
of
these
times
if
the
world
is
a
joke
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
it
is
it
ought
to
be
made
a
very
difficult
joke
to
crack
it
ought
to
be
as
hard
a
struggle
sir
as
possible
that
the
intention
but
being
made
far
too
easy
we
are
oiling
the
gates
of
life
they
ought
to
be
rusty
we
shall
have
them
beginning
to
turn
soon
with
a
smooth
sound
whereas
they
ought
to
grate
upon
their
hinges
sir
craggs
seemed
positively
to
grate
upon
his
own
hinges
as
he
delivered
this
opinion
to
which
he
communicated
immense
effect
being
a
cold
hard
dry
man
dressed
in
grey
and
white
like
a
flint
with
small
twinkles
in
his
eyes
as
if
something
struck
sparks
out
of
them
the
three
natural
kingdoms
indeed
had
each
a
fanciful
representative
among
this
brotherhood
of
disputants
for
snitchey
was
like
a
magpie
or
raven
only
not
so
sleek
and
the
doctor
had
a
streaked
face
like
a
with
here
and
there
a
dimple
to
express
the
peckings
of
the
birds
and
a
very
little
bit
of
pigtail
behind
that
stood
for
the
stalk
as
the
active
figure
of
a
handsome
young
man
dressed
for
a
journey
and
followed
by
a
porter
bearing
several
packages
and
baskets
entered
the
orchard
at
a
brisk
pace
and
with
an
air
of
gaiety
and
hope
that
accorded
well
with
the
morning
these
three
drew
together
like
the
brothers
of
the
sister
fates
or
like
the
graces
most
effectually
disguised
or
like
the
three
weird
prophets
on
the
heath
and
greeted
him
returns
alf
said
the
doctor
lightly
hundred
happy
returns
of
this
auspicious
day
mr
heathfield
said
snitchey
bowing
low
craggs
murmured
in
a
deep
voice
all
alone
what
a
battery
exclaimed
alfred
stopping
short
one
two
three
all
foreboders
of
no
good
in
the
great
sea
before
me
i
am
glad
you
are
not
the
first
i
have
met
this
morning
i
should
have
taken
it
for
a
bad
omen
but
grace
was
the
first
sweet
pleasant
grace
so
i
defy
you
all
you
please
mister
i
was
the
first
you
know
said
clemency
newcome
was
walking
out
here
before
sunrise
you
remember
i
was
in
the
house
true
clemency
was
the
first
said
alfred
i
defy
you
with
clemency
ha
ha
for
self
and
craggs
said
snitchey
a
defiance
so
bad
a
one
as
it
appears
may
be
said
alfred
shaking
hands
heartily
with
the
doctor
and
also
with
snitchey
and
craggs
and
then
looking
round
are
the
good
heavens
with
a
start
productive
for
the
moment
of
a
closer
partnership
between
jonathan
snitchey
and
thomas
craggs
than
the
subsisting
articles
of
agreement
in
that
wise
contemplated
he
hastily
betook
himself
to
where
the
sisters
stood
together
and
however
i
need
more
particularly
explain
his
manner
of
saluting
marion
first
and
grace
afterwards
than
by
hinting
that
craggs
may
possibly
have
considered
it
easy
perhaps
to
change
the
subject
jeddler
made
a
hasty
move
towards
the
breakfast
and
they
all
sat
down
at
table
grace
presided
but
so
discreetly
stationed
herself
as
to
cut
off
her
sister
and
alfred
from
the
rest
of
the
company
snitchey
and
craggs
sat
at
opposite
corners
with
the
blue
bag
between
them
for
safety
the
doctor
took
his
usual
position
opposite
to
grace
clemency
hovered
galvanically
about
the
table
as
waitress
and
the
melancholy
britain
at
another
and
a
smaller
board
acted
as
grand
carver
of
a
round
of
beef
and
a
ham
said
britain
approaching
snitchey
with
the
carving
knife
and
fork
in
his
hands
and
throwing
the
question
at
him
like
a
missile
returned
the
lawyer
you
want
any
to
craggs
and
well
done
replied
that
gentleman
having
executed
these
orders
and
moderately
supplied
the
doctor
he
seemed
to
know
that
nobody
else
wanted
anything
to
eat
he
lingered
as
near
the
firm
as
he
decently
could
watching
with
an
austere
eye
their
disposition
of
the
viands
and
but
once
relaxing
the
severe
expression
of
his
face
this
was
on
the
occasion
of
craggs
whose
teeth
were
not
of
the
best
partially
choking
when
he
cried
out
with
great
animation
thought
he
was
gone
alfred
said
the
doctor
a
word
or
two
of
business
while
we
are
yet
at
breakfast
we
are
yet
at
breakfast
said
snitchey
and
craggs
who
seemed
to
have
no
present
idea
of
leaving
off
although
alfred
had
not
been
breakfasting
and
seemed
to
have
quite
enough
business
on
his
hands
as
it
was
he
respectfully
answered
you
please
sir
anything
could
be
serious
the
doctor
began
such
a
as
this
sir
hinted
alfred
such
a
farce
as
this
observed
the
doctor
might
be
this
recurrence
on
the
eve
of
separation
of
a
double
birthday
which
is
connected
with
many
associations
pleasant
to
us
four
and
with
the
recollection
of
a
long
and
amicable
intercourse
that
not
to
the
purpose
yes
yes
jeddler
said
the
young
man
is
to
the
purpose
much
to
the
purpose
as
my
heart
bears
witness
this
morning
and
as
yours
does
too
i
know
if
you
would
let
it
speak
i
leave
your
house
i
cease
to
be
your
ward
we
part
with
tender
relations
stretching
far
behind
us
that
never
can
be
exactly
renewed
and
with
others
dawning
yet
before
us
he
looked
down
at
marion
beside
him
with
such
considerations
as
i
must
not
trust
myself
to
speak
of
now
come
come
he
added
rallying
his
spirits
and
the
doctor
at
once
a
serious
grain
in
this
large
foolish
doctor
let
us
allow
day
that
there
is
one
cried
the
doctor
him
ha
ha
ha
of
all
days
in
the
foolish
year
why
on
this
day
the
great
battle
was
fought
on
this
ground
on
this
ground
where
we
now
sit
where
i
saw
my
two
girls
dance
this
morning
where
the
fruit
has
just
been
gathered
for
our
eating
from
these
trees
the
roots
of
which
are
struck
in
men
not
earth
so
many
lives
were
lost
that
within
my
recollection
generations
afterwards
a
churchyard
full
of
bones
and
dust
of
bones
and
chips
of
cloven
skulls
has
been
dug
up
from
underneath
our
feet
here
yet
not
a
hundred
people
in
that
battle
knew
for
what
they
fought
or
why
not
a
hundred
of
the
inconsiderate
rejoicers
in
the
victory
why
they
rejoiced
not
half
a
hundred
people
were
the
better
for
the
gain
or
loss
not
men
agree
to
this
hour
on
the
cause
or
merits
and
nobody
in
short
ever
knew
anything
distinct
about
it
but
the
mourners
of
the
slain
serious
too
said
the
doctor
laughing
a
system
all
this
seems
to
me
said
alfred
be
very
serious
cried
the
doctor
you
allowed
such
things
to
be
serious
you
must
go
mad
or
die
or
climb
up
to
the
top
of
a
mountain
and
turn
hermit
so
long
ago
said
alfred
ago
returned
the
doctor
you
know
what
the
world
has
been
doing
ever
since
do
you
know
what
else
it
has
been
doing
i
do
has
gone
to
law
a
little
observed
snitchey
stirring
his
tea
the
way
out
has
been
always
made
too
easy
said
his
partner
you
excuse
my
saying
doctor
pursued
snitchey
been
already
put
a
thousand
times
in
possession
of
my
opinion
in
the
course
of
our
discussions
that
in
its
having
gone
to
law
and
in
its
legal
system
altogether
i
do
observe
a
serious
side
now
really
a
something
tangible
and
with
a
purpose
and
intention
in
it
clemency
newcome
made
an
angular
tumble
against
the
table
occasioning
a
sounding
clatter
among
the
cups
and
saucers
what
the
matter
there
exclaimed
the
doctor
this
blue
bag
said
clemency
tripping
up
somebody
a
purpose
and
intention
in
it
i
was
saying
resumed
snitchey
commands
respect
life
a
farce
jeddler
with
law
in
it
the
doctor
laughed
and
looked
at
alfred
if
you
please
that
war
is
foolish
said
snitchey
we
agree
for
example
here
a
smiling
country
pointing
it
out
with
his
fork
overrun
by
soldiers
trespassers
every
man
of
and
laid
waste
by
fire
and
sword
he
he
he
the
idea
of
any
man
exposing
himself
voluntarily
to
fire
and
sword
stupid
wasteful
positively
ridiculous
you
laugh
at
your
creatures
you
know
when
you
think
of
it
but
take
this
smiling
country
as
it
stands
think
of
the
laws
appertaining
to
real
property
to
the
bequest
and
devise
of
real
property
to
the
mortgage
and
redemption
of
real
property
to
leasehold
freehold
and
copyhold
estate
think
said
snitchey
with
such
great
emotion
that
he
actually
smacked
his
lips
the
complicated
laws
relating
to
title
and
proof
of
title
with
all
the
contradictory
precedents
and
numerous
acts
of
parliament
connected
with
them
think
of
the
infinite
number
of
ingenious
and
interminable
chancery
suits
to
which
this
pleasant
prospect
may
give
rise
and
acknowledge
jeddler
that
there
is
a
green
spot
in
the
scheme
about
us
i
believe
said
snitchey
looking
at
his
partner
i
speak
for
self
and
craggs
craggs
having
signified
assent
snitchey
somewhat
freshened
by
his
recent
eloquence
observed
that
he
would
take
a
little
more
beef
and
another
cup
of
tea
do
stand
up
for
life
in
general
he
added
rubbing
his
hands
and
chuckling
full
of
folly
full
of
something
worse
professions
of
trust
and
confidence
and
unselfishness
and
all
that
bah
bah
bah
we
see
what
they
worth
but
you
laugh
at
life
you
got
a
game
to
play
a
very
serious
game
indeed
everybody
playing
against
you
you
know
and
playing
against
them
oh
it
a
very
interesting
thing
there
are
deep
moves
upon
the
board
you
must
only
laugh
jeddler
when
you
win
and
then
not
much
he
he
he
and
then
not
much
repeated
snitchey
rolling
his
head
and
winking
his
eye
as
if
he
would
have
added
may
do
this
instead
alfred
cried
the
doctor
do
you
say
now
say
sir
replied
alfred
the
greatest
favour
you
could
do
me
and
yourself
too
i
am
inclined
to
think
would
be
to
try
sometimes
to
forget
this
and
others
like
it
in
that
broader
of
life
on
which
the
sun
looks
every
day
i
afraid
that
would
soften
his
opinions
alfred
said
snitchey
combatants
are
very
eager
and
very
bitter
in
that
same
battle
of
life
there
a
great
deal
of
cutting
and
slashing
and
firing
into
people
heads
from
behind
there
is
terrible
treading
down
and
trampling
on
it
is
rather
a
bad
business
believe
snitchey
said
alfred
are
quiet
victories
and
struggles
great
sacrifices
of
self
and
noble
acts
of
heroism
in
it
even
in
many
of
its
apparent
lightnesses
and
contradictions
not
the
less
difficult
to
achieve
because
they
have
no
earthly
chronicle
or
audience
done
every
day
in
nooks
and
corners
and
in
little
households
and
in
men
and
women
hearts
any
one
of
which
might
reconcile
the
sternest
man
to
such
a
world
and
fill
him
with
belief
and
hope
in
it
though
of
its
people
were
at
war
and
another
fourth
at
law
and
that
a
bold
word
both
the
sisters
listened
keenly
well
said
the
doctor
am
too
old
to
be
converted
even
by
my
friend
snitchey
here
or
my
good
spinster
sister
martha
jeddler
who
had
what
she
calls
her
domestic
trials
ages
ago
and
has
led
a
sympathising
life
with
all
sorts
of
people
ever
since
and
who
is
so
much
of
your
opinion
only
she
less
reasonable
and
more
obstinate
being
a
woman
that
we
ca
agree
and
seldom
meet
i
was
born
upon
this
i
began
as
a
boy
to
have
my
thoughts
directed
to
the
real
history
of
a
sixty
years
have
gone
over
my
head
and
i
have
never
seen
the
christian
world
including
heaven
knows
how
many
loving
mothers
and
good
enough
girls
like
mine
here
anything
but
mad
for
a
field
the
same
contradictions
prevail
in
everything
one
must
either
laugh
or
cry
at
such
stupendous
inconsistencies
and
i
prefer
to
laugh
britain
who
had
been
paying
the
profoundest
and
most
melancholy
attention
to
each
speaker
in
his
turn
seemed
suddenly
to
decide
in
favour
of
the
same
preference
if
a
deep
sepulchral
sound
that
escaped
him
might
be
construed
into
a
demonstration
of
risibility
his
face
however
was
so
perfectly
unaffected
by
it
both
before
and
afterwards
that
although
one
or
two
of
the
breakfast
party
looked
round
as
being
startled
by
a
mysterious
noise
nobody
connected
the
offender
with
it
except
his
partner
in
attendance
clemency
newcome
who
rousing
him
with
one
of
those
favourite
joints
her
elbows
inquired
in
a
reproachful
whisper
what
he
laughed
at
you
said
britain
then
said
britain
the
joke
between
master
and
them
lawyers
he
getting
more
and
more
every
day
cried
clemency
giving
him
a
lunge
with
the
other
elbow
as
a
mental
stimulant
you
know
where
you
are
do
you
want
to
get
warning
do
know
anything
said
britain
with
a
leaden
eye
and
an
immovable
visage
do
care
for
anything
i
do
make
out
anything
i
do
believe
anything
and
i
do
want
anything
although
this
forlorn
summary
of
his
general
condition
may
have
been
overcharged
in
an
access
of
despondency
benjamin
britain
sometimes
called
little
britain
to
distinguish
him
from
great
as
we
might
say
young
england
to
express
old
england
with
a
decided
difference
had
defined
his
real
state
more
accurately
than
might
be
supposed
for
serving
as
a
sort
of
man
miles
to
the
friar
bacon
and
listening
day
after
day
to
innumerable
orations
addressed
by
the
doctor
to
various
people
all
tending
to
show
that
his
very
existence
was
at
best
a
mistake
and
an
absurdity
this
unfortunate
servitor
had
fallen
by
degrees
into
such
an
abyss
of
confused
and
contradictory
suggestions
from
within
and
without
that
truth
at
the
bottom
of
her
well
was
on
the
level
surface
as
compared
with
britain
in
the
depths
of
his
mystification
the
only
point
he
clearly
comprehended
was
that
the
new
element
usually
brought
into
these
discussions
by
snitchey
and
craggs
never
served
to
make
them
clearer
and
always
seemed
to
give
the
doctor
a
species
of
advantage
and
confirmation
therefore
he
looked
upon
the
firm
as
one
of
the
proximate
causes
of
his
state
of
mind
and
held
them
in
abhorrence
accordingly
this
is
not
our
business
alfred
said
the
doctor
to
be
my
ward
as
you
have
said
and
leaving
us
full
to
the
brim
of
such
learning
as
the
grammar
school
down
here
was
able
to
give
you
and
your
studies
in
london
could
add
to
that
and
such
practical
knowledge
as
a
dull
old
country
doctor
like
myself
could
graft
upon
both
you
are
away
now
into
the
world
the
first
term
of
probation
appointed
by
your
poor
father
being
over
away
you
go
now
your
own
master
to
fulfil
his
second
desire
and
long
before
your
three
years
tour
among
the
foreign
schools
of
medicine
is
finished
you
have
forgotten
us
lord
you
forget
us
easily
in
six
months
i
do
but
you
know
better
why
should
i
speak
to
you
said
alfred
laughing
do
know
anything
of
the
sort
returned
the
doctor
do
you
say
marion
marion
trifling
with
her
teacup
seemed
to
say
but
she
say
it
that
he
was
welcome
to
forget
if
he
could
grace
pressed
the
blooming
face
against
her
cheek
and
smiled
have
been
i
hope
a
very
unjust
steward
in
the
execution
of
my
trust
pursued
the
doctor
i
am
to
be
at
any
rate
formally
discharged
and
released
and
what
not
this
morning
and
here
are
our
good
friends
snitchey
and
craggs
with
a
bagful
of
papers
and
accounts
and
documents
for
the
transfer
of
the
balance
of
the
trust
fund
to
you
i
wish
it
was
a
more
difficult
one
to
dispose
of
alfred
but
you
must
get
to
be
a
great
man
and
make
it
so
and
other
drolleries
of
that
sort
which
are
to
be
signed
sealed
and
delivered
duly
witnessed
as
by
law
required
said
snitchey
pushing
away
his
plate
and
taking
out
the
papers
which
his
partner
proceeded
to
spread
upon
the
table
self
and
craggs
having
been
with
you
doctor
in
so
far
as
the
fund
was
concerned
we
shall
want
your
two
servants
to
attest
the
signatures
can
you
read
mrs
newcome
a
married
mister
said
clemency
i
beg
your
pardon
i
should
think
not
chuckled
snitchey
casting
his
eyes
over
her
extraordinary
figure
can
read
little
answered
clemency
marriage
service
night
and
morning
eh
observed
the
lawyer
jocosely
said
clemency
hard
i
only
reads
a
thimble
a
thimble
echoed
snitchey
are
you
talking
about
young
woman
clemency
nodded
a
this
is
a
lunatic
a
subject
for
the
lord
high
chancellor
said
snitchey
staring
at
her
possessed
of
any
property
stipulated
craggs
grace
however
interposing
explained
that
each
of
the
articles
in
question
bore
an
engraved
motto
and
so
formed
the
pocket
library
of
clemency
newcome
who
was
not
much
given
to
the
study
of
books
that
it
is
it
miss
grace
said
snitchey
yes
ha
ha
ha
i
thought
our
friend
was
an
idiot
she
looks
uncommonly
like
it
he
muttered
with
a
supercilious
glance
what
does
the
thimble
say
mrs
newcome
a
married
mister
observed
clemency
newcome
will
that
do
said
the
lawyer
does
the
thimble
say
newcome
how
clemency
before
replying
to
this
question
held
one
pocket
open
and
looked
down
into
its
yawning
depths
for
the
thimble
which
was
there
and
how
she
then
held
an
opposite
pocket
open
and
seeming
to
descry
it
like
a
pearl
of
great
price
at
the
bottom
cleared
away
such
intervening
obstacles
as
a
handkerchief
an
end
of
wax
candle
a
flushed
apple
an
orange
a
lucky
penny
a
cramp
bone
a
padlock
a
pair
of
scissors
in
a
sheath
more
expressively
describable
as
promising
young
shears
a
handful
or
so
of
loose
beads
several
balls
of
cotton
a
a
cabinet
collection
of
and
a
biscuit
all
of
which
articles
she
entrusted
individually
and
separately
to
britain
to
hold
is
of
no
consequence
nor
how
in
her
determination
to
grasp
this
pocket
by
the
throat
and
keep
it
prisoner
for
it
had
a
tendency
to
swing
and
twist
itself
round
the
nearest
corner
she
assumed
and
calmly
maintained
an
attitude
apparently
inconsistent
with
the
human
anatomy
and
the
laws
of
gravity
it
is
enough
that
at
last
she
triumphantly
produced
the
thimble
on
her
finger
and
rattled
the
the
literature
of
both
those
trinkets
being
obviously
in
course
of
wearing
out
and
wasting
away
through
excessive
friction
the
thimble
is
it
young
woman
said
snitchey
diverting
himself
at
her
expense
what
does
the
thimble
say
says
replied
clemency
reading
slowly
round
as
if
it
were
a
tower
and
snitchey
and
craggs
laughed
heartily
new
said
snitchey
easy
said
craggs
a
knowledge
of
human
nature
in
it
said
snitchey
applicable
to
the
affairs
of
life
said
craggs
the
inquired
the
head
of
the
firm
grater
says
returned
clemency
as
you
wold
be
done
by
or
you
be
done
brown
you
mean
said
snitchey
do
understand
retorted
clemency
shaking
her
head
vaguely
a
no
lawyer
am
afraid
that
if
she
was
doctor
said
snitchey
turning
to
him
suddenly
as
if
to
anticipate
any
effect
that
might
otherwise
be
consequent
on
this
retort
find
it
to
be
the
golden
rule
of
half
her
clients
they
are
serious
enough
in
that
whimsical
as
your
world
is
and
lay
the
blame
on
us
afterwards
we
in
our
profession
are
little
else
than
mirrors
after
all
alfred
but
we
are
generally
consulted
by
angry
and
quarrelsome
people
who
are
not
in
their
best
looks
and
it
rather
hard
to
quarrel
with
us
if
we
reflect
unpleasant
aspects
i
think
said
snitchey
i
speak
for
self
and
craggs
said
craggs
so
if
britain
will
oblige
us
with
a
mouthful
of
ink
said
snitchey
returning
to
the
papers
sign
seal
and
deliver
as
soon
as
possible
or
the
coach
will
be
coming
past
before
we
know
where
we
are
if
one
might
judge
from
his
appearance
there
was
every
probability
of
the
coach
coming
past
before
britain
knew
where
he
was
for
he
stood
in
a
state
of
abstraction
mentally
balancing
the
doctor
against
the
lawyers
and
the
lawyers
against
the
doctor
and
their
clients
against
both
and
engaged
in
feeble
attempts
to
make
the
thimble
and
a
new
idea
to
him
square
with
system
of
philosophy
and
in
short
bewildering
himself
as
much
as
ever
his
great
namesake
has
done
with
theories
and
schools
but
clemency
who
was
his
good
genius
though
he
had
the
meanest
possible
opinion
of
her
understanding
by
reason
of
her
seldom
troubling
herself
with
abstract
speculations
and
being
always
at
hand
to
do
the
right
thing
at
the
right
time
having
produced
the
ink
in
a
twinkling
tendered
him
the
further
service
of
recalling
him
to
himself
by
the
application
of
her
elbows
with
which
gentle
flappers
she
so
jogged
his
memory
in
a
more
literal
construction
of
that
phrase
than
usual
that
he
soon
became
quite
fresh
and
brisk
how
he
laboured
under
an
apprehension
not
uncommon
to
persons
in
his
degree
to
whom
the
use
of
pen
and
ink
is
an
event
that
he
could
append
his
name
to
a
document
not
of
his
own
writing
without
committing
himself
in
some
shadowy
manner
or
somehow
signing
away
vague
and
enormous
sums
of
money
and
how
he
approached
the
deeds
under
protest
and
by
dint
of
the
coercion
and
insisted
on
pausing
to
look
at
them
before
writing
the
cramped
hand
to
say
nothing
of
the
phraseology
being
so
much
chinese
to
him
and
also
on
turning
them
round
to
see
whether
there
was
anything
fraudulent
underneath
and
how
having
signed
his
name
he
became
desolate
as
one
who
had
parted
with
his
property
and
rights
i
want
the
time
to
tell
also
how
the
blue
bag
containing
his
signature
afterwards
had
a
mysterious
interest
for
him
and
he
could
leave
it
also
how
clemency
newcome
in
an
ecstasy
of
laughter
at
the
idea
of
her
own
importance
and
dignity
brooded
over
the
whole
table
with
her
two
elbows
like
a
spread
eagle
and
reposed
her
head
upon
her
left
arm
as
a
preliminary
to
the
formation
of
certain
cabalistic
characters
which
required
a
deal
of
ink
and
imaginary
counterparts
whereof
she
executed
at
the
same
time
with
her
tongue
also
how
having
once
tasted
ink
she
became
thirsty
in
that
regard
as
tame
tigers
are
said
to
be
after
tasting
another
sort
of
fluid
and
wanted
to
sign
everything
and
put
her
name
in
all
kinds
of
places
in
brief
the
doctor
was
discharged
of
his
trust
and
all
its
responsibilities
and
alfred
taking
it
on
himself
was
fairly
started
on
the
journey
of
life
said
the
doctor
to
the
gate
and
watch
for
the
coach
time
flies
alfred
sir
yes
returned
the
young
man
hurriedly
grace
a
moment
marion
so
young
and
beautiful
so
winning
and
so
much
admired
dear
to
my
heart
as
nothing
else
in
life
is
remember
i
leave
marion
to
you
has
always
been
a
sacred
charge
to
me
alfred
she
is
doubly
so
now
i
will
be
faithful
to
my
trust
believe
me
do
believe
it
grace
i
know
it
well
who
could
look
upon
your
face
and
hear
your
voice
and
not
know
it
ah
grace
if
i
had
your
heart
and
tranquil
mind
how
bravely
i
would
leave
this
place
you
she
answered
with
a
quiet
smile
yet
grace
sister
seems
the
natural
word
it
she
said
quickly
am
glad
to
hear
it
call
me
nothing
else
yet
sister
then
said
alfred
and
i
had
better
have
your
true
and
steadfast
qualities
serving
us
here
and
making
us
both
happier
and
better
i
would
carry
them
away
to
sustain
myself
if
i
could
upon
the
exclaimed
britain
flies
alfred
said
the
doctor
marion
had
stood
apart
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
but
this
warning
being
given
her
young
lover
brought
her
tenderly
to
where
her
sister
stood
and
gave
her
into
her
embrace
have
been
telling
grace
dear
marion
he
said
you
are
her
charge
my
precious
trust
at
parting
and
when
i
come
back
and
reclaim
you
dearest
and
the
bright
prospect
of
our
married
life
lies
stretched
before
us
it
shall
be
one
of
our
chief
pleasures
to
consult
how
we
can
make
grace
happy
how
we
can
anticipate
her
wishes
how
we
can
show
our
gratitude
and
love
to
her
how
we
can
return
her
something
of
the
debt
she
will
have
heaped
upon
us
the
younger
sister
had
one
hand
in
his
the
other
rested
on
her
sister
neck
she
looked
into
that
sister
eyes
so
calm
serene
and
cheerful
with
a
gaze
in
which
affection
admiration
sorrow
wonder
almost
veneration
were
blended
she
looked
into
that
sister
face
as
if
it
were
the
face
of
some
bright
angel
calm
serene
and
cheerful
the
face
looked
back
on
her
and
on
her
lover
when
the
time
comes
as
it
must
one
day
said
alfred
wonder
it
has
never
come
yet
but
grace
knows
best
for
grace
is
always
right
when
she
will
want
a
friend
to
open
her
whole
heart
to
and
to
be
to
her
something
of
what
she
has
been
to
us
then
marion
how
faithful
we
will
prove
and
what
delight
to
us
to
know
that
she
our
dear
good
sister
loves
and
is
loved
again
as
we
would
have
her
still
the
younger
sister
looked
into
her
eyes
and
turned
not
even
towards
him
and
still
those
honest
eyes
looked
back
so
calm
serene
and
cheerful
on
herself
and
on
her
lover
when
all
that
is
past
and
we
are
old
and
living
as
we
must
together
close
together
talking
often
of
old
times
said
alfred
shall
be
our
favourite
times
among
them
this
day
most
of
all
and
telling
each
other
what
we
thought
and
felt
and
hoped
and
feared
at
parting
and
how
we
could
bear
to
say
good
bye
coming
through
the
wood
cried
britain
i
am
ready
and
how
we
met
again
so
happily
in
spite
of
all
we
make
this
day
the
happiest
in
all
the
year
and
keep
it
as
a
treble
shall
we
dear
interposed
the
elder
sister
eagerly
and
with
a
radiant
smile
alfred
do
linger
there
no
time
say
good
bye
to
marion
and
heaven
be
with
you
he
pressed
the
younger
sister
to
his
heart
released
from
his
embrace
she
again
clung
to
her
sister
and
her
eyes
with
the
same
blended
look
again
sought
those
so
calm
serene
and
cheerful
my
boy
said
the
doctor
talk
about
any
serious
correspondence
or
serious
affections
and
engagements
and
so
forth
in
such
a
ha
ha
ha
you
know
what
i
mean
why
that
of
course
would
be
sheer
nonsense
all
i
can
say
is
that
if
you
and
marion
should
continue
in
the
same
foolish
minds
i
shall
not
object
to

chapter
ii
part
the
second
snitchey
and
craggs
had
a
snug
little
office
on
the
old
battle
ground
where
they
drove
a
snug
little
business
and
fought
a
great
many
small
pitched
battles
for
a
great
many
contending
parties
though
it
could
hardly
be
said
of
these
conflicts
that
they
were
running
fights
for
in
truth
they
generally
proceeded
at
a
pace
the
part
the
firm
had
in
them
came
so
far
within
the
general
denomination
that
now
they
took
a
shot
at
this
plaintiff
and
now
aimed
a
chop
at
that
defendant
now
made
a
heavy
charge
at
an
estate
in
chancery
and
now
had
some
light
skirmishing
among
an
irregular
body
of
small
debtors
just
as
the
occasion
served
and
the
enemy
happened
to
present
himself
the
gazette
was
an
important
and
profitable
feature
in
some
of
their
fields
as
in
fields
of
greater
renown
and
in
most
of
the
actions
wherein
they
showed
their
generalship
it
was
afterwards
observed
by
the
combatants
that
they
had
had
great
difficulty
in
making
each
other
out
or
in
knowing
with
any
degree
of
distinctness
what
they
were
about
in
consequence
of
the
vast
amount
of
smoke
by
which
they
were
surrounded
the
offices
of
snitchey
and
craggs
stood
convenient
with
an
open
door
down
two
smooth
steps
in
the
so
that
any
angry
farmer
inclining
towards
hot
water
might
tumble
into
it
at
once
their
special
and
hall
of
conference
was
an
old
with
a
low
dark
ceiling
which
seemed
to
be
knitting
its
brows
gloomily
in
the
consideration
of
tangled
points
of
law
it
was
furnished
with
some
leathern
chairs
garnished
with
great
brass
nails
of
which
every
here
and
there
two
or
three
had
fallen
out
or
had
been
picked
out
perhaps
by
the
wandering
thumbs
and
forefingers
of
bewildered
clients
there
was
a
framed
print
of
a
great
judge
in
it
every
curl
in
whose
dreadful
wig
had
made
a
man
hair
stand
on
end
bales
of
papers
filled
the
dusty
closets
shelves
and
tables
and
round
the
wainscot
there
were
tiers
of
boxes
padlocked
and
fireproof
with
people
names
painted
outside
which
anxious
visitors
felt
themselves
by
a
cruel
enchantment
obliged
to
spell
backwards
and
forwards
and
to
make
anagrams
of
while
they
sat
seeming
to
listen
to
snitchey
and
craggs
without
comprehending
one
word
of
what
they
said
snitchey
and
craggs
had
each
in
private
life
as
in
professional
existence
a
partner
of
his
own
snitchey
and
craggs
were
the
best
friends
in
the
world
and
had
a
real
confidence
in
one
another
but
snitchey
by
a
dispensation
not
uncommon
in
the
affairs
of
life
was
on
principle
suspicious
of
craggs
and
craggs
was
on
principle
suspicious
of
snitchey
snitcheys
indeed
the
latter
lady
would
observe
sometimes
to
craggs
using
that
imaginative
plural
as
if
in
disparagement
of
an
objectionable
pair
of
pantaloons
or
other
articles
not
possessed
of
a
singular
number
do
see
what
you
want
with
your
snitcheys
for
my
part
you
trust
a
great
deal
too
much
to
your
snitcheys
i
think
and
i
hope
you
may
never
find
my
words
come
true
while
snitchey
would
observe
to
snitchey
of
craggs
if
ever
he
was
led
away
by
man
he
was
led
away
by
that
man
and
that
if
ever
she
read
a
double
purpose
in
a
mortal
eye
she
read
that
purpose
in
craggs
eye
notwithstanding
this
however
they
were
all
very
good
friends
in
general
and
snitchey
and
craggs
maintained
a
close
bond
of
alliance
against
office
which
they
both
considered
the
blue
chamber
and
common
enemy
full
of
dangerous
because
unknown
machinations
in
this
office
nevertheless
snitchey
and
craggs
made
honey
for
their
several
hives
here
sometimes
they
would
linger
of
a
fine
evening
at
the
window
of
their
overlooking
the
old
and
wonder
but
that
was
generally
at
assize
time
when
much
business
had
made
them
sentimental
at
the
folly
of
mankind
who
could
always
be
at
peace
with
one
another
and
go
to
law
comfortably
here
days
and
weeks
and
months
and
years
passed
over
them
their
calendar
the
gradually
diminishing
number
of
brass
nails
in
the
leathern
chairs
and
the
increasing
bulk
of
papers
on
the
tables
here
nearly
three
years
flight
had
thinned
the
one
and
swelled
the
other
since
the
breakfast
in
the
orchard
when
they
sat
together
in
consultation
at
night
not
alone
but
with
a
man
of
thirty
or
about
that
time
of
life
negligently
dressed
and
somewhat
haggard
in
the
face
but
made
and
who
sat
in
the
armchair
of
state
with
one
hand
in
his
breast
and
the
other
in
his
dishevelled
hair
pondering
moodily
snitchey
and
craggs
sat
opposite
each
other
at
a
neighbouring
desk
one
of
the
fireproof
boxes
unpadlocked
and
opened
was
upon
it
a
part
of
its
contents
lay
strewn
upon
the
table
and
the
rest
was
then
in
course
of
passing
through
the
hands
of
snitchey
who
brought
it
to
the
candle
document
by
document
looked
at
every
paper
singly
as
he
produced
it
shook
his
head
and
handed
it
to
craggs
who
looked
it
over
also
shook
his
head
and
laid
it
down
sometimes
they
would
stop
and
shaking
their
heads
in
concert
look
towards
the
abstracted
client
and
the
name
on
the
box
being
michael
warden
esquire
we
may
conclude
from
these
premises
that
the
name
and
the
box
were
both
his
and
that
the
affairs
of
michael
warden
esquire
were
in
a
bad
way
all
said
snitchey
turning
up
the
last
paper
there
no
other
resource
no
other
resource
lost
spent
wasted
pawned
borrowed
and
sold
eh
said
the
client
looking
up
returned
snitchey
else
to
be
done
you
say
at
all
the
client
bit
his
nails
and
pondered
again
i
am
not
even
personally
safe
in
england
you
hold
to
that
do
you
no
part
of
the
united
kingdom
of
great
britain
and
ireland
replied
snitchey
mere
prodigal
son
with
no
father
to
go
back
to
no
swine
to
keep
and
no
husks
to
share
with
them
eh
pursued
the
client
rocking
one
leg
over
the
other
and
searching
the
ground
with
his
eyes
snitchey
coughed
as
if
to
deprecate
the
being
supposed
to
participate
in
any
figurative
illustration
of
a
legal
position
craggs
as
if
to
express
that
it
was
a
partnership
view
of
the
subject
also
coughed
at
thirty
said
the
client
ruined
mr
warden
returned
snitchey
so
bad
as
that
you
have
done
a
good
deal
towards
it
i
must
say
but
you
are
not
ruined
a
little
nursing
little
devil
said
the
client
craggs
said
snitchey
you
oblige
me
with
a
pinch
of
snuff
thank
you
sir
as
the
imperturbable
lawyer
applied
it
to
his
nose
with
great
apparent
relish
and
a
perfect
absorption
of
his
attention
in
the
proceeding
the
client
gradually
broke
into
a
smile
and
looking
up
said
talk
of
nursing
how
long
nursing
long
nursing
repeated
snitchey
dusting
the
snuff
from
his
fingers
and
making
a
slow
calculation
in
his
mind
your
involved
estate
sir
in
good
hands
and
say
six
or
seven
years
starve
for
six
or
seven
years
said
the
client
with
a
fretful
laugh
and
an
impatient
change
of
his
position
starve
for
six
or
seven
years
mr
warden
said
snitchey
be
very
uncommon
indeed
you
might
get
another
estate
by
showing
yourself
the
while
but
we
do
think
you
could
do
it
speaking
for
self
and
craggs
and
consequently
do
advise
it
do
you
advise
i
say
repeated
snitchey
few
years
of
nursing
by
self
and
craggs
would
bring
it
round
but
to
enable
us
to
make
terms
and
hold
terms
and
you
to
keep
terms
you
must
go
away
you
must
live
abroad
as
to
starvation
we
could
ensure
you
some
hundreds
to
starve
upon
even
in
the
beginning
i
dare
say
mr
warden
said
the
client
i
have
spent
thousands
retorted
snitchey
putting
the
papers
slowly
back
into
the
box
is
no
doubt
about
no
doubt
he
repeated
to
himself
as
he
thoughtfully
pursued
his
occupation
the
lawyer
very
likely
knew
his
man
at
any
rate
his
dry
shrewd
whimsical
manner
had
a
favourable
influence
on
the
client
moody
state
and
disposed
him
to
be
more
free
and
unreserved
or
perhaps
the
client
knew
his
man
and
had
elicited
such
encouragement
as
he
had
received
to
render
some
purpose
he
was
about
to
disclose
the
more
defensible
in
appearance
gradually
raising
his
head
he
sat
looking
at
his
immovable
adviser
with
a
smile
which
presently
broke
into
a
laugh
all
he
said
friend
snitchey
pointed
out
his
partner
and
excuse
me
craggs
beg
craggs
pardon
said
the
client
all
my
headed
friends
he
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
and
dropped
his
voice
a
little
do
know
half
my
ruin
yet
snitchey
stopped
and
stared
at
him
craggs
also
stared
am
not
only
deep
in
debt
said
the
client
i
am
deep
in
in
love
cried
snitchey
said
the
client
falling
back
in
his
chair
and
surveying
the
firm
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
in
love
not
with
an
heiress
sir
said
snitchey
with
an
heiress
a
rich
lady
a
rich
lady
that
i
know
of
except
in
beauty
and
merit
single
lady
i
trust
said
snitchey
with
great
expression
not
one
of
jeddler
daughters
said
snitchey
suddenly
squaring
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
advancing
his
face
at
least
a
yard
returned
the
client
his
younger
daughter
said
snitchey
returned
the
client
craggs
said
snitchey
much
relieved
you
oblige
me
with
another
pinch
of
snuff
thank
you
i
am
happy
to
say
it
do
signify
mr
warden
she
engaged
sir
she
bespoke
my
partner
can
corroborate
me
we
know
the
fact
know
the
fact
repeated
craggs
so
do
i
perhaps
returned
the
client
quietly
of
that
are
you
men
of
the
world
and
did
you
never
hear
of
a
woman
changing
her
mind
certainly
have
been
actions
for
breach
said
snitchey
against
both
spinsters
and
widows
but
in
the
majority
of
cases
interposed
the
client
impatiently
talk
to
me
of
cases
the
general
precedent
is
in
a
much
larger
volume
than
any
of
your
law
books
besides
do
you
think
i
have
lived
six
weeks
in
the
doctor
house
for
nothing
think
sir
observed
snitchey
gravely
addressing
himself
to
his
partner
of
all
the
scrapes
mr
warden
horses
have
brought
him
into
at
one
time
and
another
and
they
have
been
pretty
numerous
and
pretty
expensive
as
none
know
better
than
himself
and
you
and
i
the
worst
scrape
may
turn
out
to
be
if
he
talks
in
this
way
this
having
ever
been
left
by
one
of
them
at
the
doctor
garden
wall
with
three
broken
ribs
a
snapped
bone
and
the
lord
knows
how
many
bruises
we
did
think
so
much
of
it
at
the
time
when
we
knew
he
was
going
on
well
under
the
doctor
hands
and
roof
but
it
looks
bad
now
sir
bad
it
looks
very
bad
doctor
jeddler
too
our
client
mr
craggs
alfred
heathfield
too
a
sort
of
client
snitchey
said
craggs
michael
warden
too
a
kind
of
client
said
the
careless
visitor
no
bad
one
either
having
played
the
fool
for
ten
or
twelve
years
however
michael
warden
has
sown
his
wild
oats
now
there
their
crop
in
that
box
and
he
means
to
repent
and
be
wise
and
in
proof
of
it
michael
warden
means
if
he
can
to
marry
marion
the
doctor
lovely
daughter
and
to
carry
her
away
with
him
craggs
snitchey
began
snitchey
and
craggs
partners
both
said
the
client
interrupting
him
know
your
duty
to
your
clients
and
you
know
well
enough
i
am
sure
that
it
is
no
part
of
it
to
interfere
in
a
mere
love
affair
which
i
am
obliged
to
confide
to
you
i
am
not
going
to
carry
the
young
lady
off
without
her
own
consent
there
nothing
illegal
in
it
i
never
was
heathfield
bosom
friend
i
violate
no
confidence
of
his
i
love
where
he
loves
and
i
mean
to
win
where
he
would
win
if
i
can
ca
craggs
said
snitchey
evidently
anxious
and
discomfited
ca
do
it
sir
she
dotes
on
mr
alfred
she
returned
the
client
craggs
she
dotes
on
him
sir
persisted
snitchey
did
live
six
weeks
some
few
months
ago
in
the
house
for
nothing
and
i
doubted
that
soon
observed
the
client
would
have
doted
on
him
if
her
sister
could
have
brought
it
about
but
i
watched
them
marion
avoided
his
name
avoided
the
subject
shrunk
from
the
least
allusion
to
it
with
evident
distress
should
she
craggs
you
know
why
should
she
sir
inquired
snitchey
do
know
why
she
should
though
there
are
many
likely
reasons
said
the
client
smiling
at
the
attention
and
perplexity
expressed
in
snitchey
shining
eye
and
at
his
cautious
way
of
carrying
on
the
conversation
and
making
himself
informed
upon
the
subject
i
know
she
does
she
was
very
young
when
she
made
the
engagement
if
it
may
be
called
one
i
am
not
even
sure
of
that
and
has
repented
of
it
perhaps
perhaps
it
seems
a
foppish
thing
to
say
but
upon
my
soul
i
do
mean
it
in
that
light
she
may
have
fallen
in
love
with
me
as
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
her
he
alfred
her
old
playfellow
too
you
remember
craggs
said
snitchey
with
a
disconcerted
laugh
her
almost
from
a
baby
makes
it
the
more
probable
that
she
may
be
tired
of
his
idea
calmly
pursued
the
client
not
indisposed
to
exchange
it
for
the
newer
one
of
another
lover
who
presents
himself
or
is
presented
by
his
horse
under
romantic
circumstances
has
the
not
unfavourable
reputation
with
a
country
girl
of
having
lived
thoughtlessly
and
gaily
without
doing
much
harm
to
anybody
and
who
for
his
youth
and
figure
and
so
forth
this
may
seem
foppish
again
but
upon
my
soul
i
do
mean
it
in
that
light
might
perhaps
pass
muster
in
a
crowd
with
alfred
himself
there
was
no
gainsaying
the
last
clause
certainly
and
snitchey
glancing
at
him
thought
so
there
was
something
naturally
graceful
and
pleasant
in
the
very
carelessness
of
his
air
it
seemed
to
suggest
of
his
comely
face
and
figure
that
they
might
be
greatly
better
if
he
chose
and
that
once
roused
and
made
earnest
but
he
never
had
been
earnest
yet
he
could
be
full
of
fire
and
purpose
dangerous
sort
of
libertine
thought
the
shrewd
lawyer
seem
to
catch
the
spark
he
wants
from
a
young
lady
eyes
observe
snitchey
he
continued
rising
and
taking
him
by
the
button
craggs
taking
him
by
the
button
also
and
placing
one
partner
on
either
side
of
him
so
that
neither
might
evade
him
do
ask
you
for
any
advice
you
are
right
to
keep
quite
aloof
from
all
parties
in
such
a
matter
which
is
not
one
in
which
grave
men
like
you
could
interfere
on
any
side
i
am
briefly
going
to
review
in
words
my
position
and
intention
and
then
i
shall
leave
it
to
you
to
do
the
best
for
me
in
money
matters
that
you
can
seeing
that
if
i
run
away
with
the
doctor
beautiful
daughter
as
i
hope
to
do
and
to
become
another
man
under
her
bright
influence
it
will
be
for
the
moment
more
chargeable
than
running
away
alone
but
i
shall
soon
make
all
that
up
in
an
altered
life
think
it
will
be
better
not
to
hear
this
mr
craggs
said
snitchey
looking
at
him
across
the
client
think
not
said
both
listened
attentively
you
need
hear
it
replied
their
client
mention
it
however
i
do
mean
to
ask
the
doctor
consent
because
he
would
give
it
me
but
i
mean
to
do
the
doctor
no
wrong
or
harm
because
besides
there
being
nothing
serious
in
such
trifles
as
he
says
i
hope
to
rescue
his
child
my
marion
from
what
i
see
i
know
she
dreads
and
contemplates
with
misery
that
is
the
return
of
this
old
lover
if
anything
in
the
world
is
true
it
is
true
that
she
dreads
his
return
nobody
is
injured
so
far
i
am
so
harried
and
worried
here
just
now
that
i
lead
the
life
of
a
i
skulk
about
in
the
dark
i
am
shut
out
of
my
own
house
and
warned
off
my
own
grounds
but
that
house
and
those
grounds
and
many
an
acre
besides
will
come
back
to
me
one
day
as
you
know
and
say
and
marion
will
probably
be
richer
on
your
showing
who
are
never
sanguine
ten
years
hence
as
my
wife
than
as
the
wife
of
alfred
heathfield
whose
return
she
dreads
remember
that
and
in
whom
or
in
any
man
my
passion
is
not
surpassed
who
is
injured
yet
it
is
a
fair
case
throughout
my
right
is
as
good
as
his
if
she
decide
in
my
favour
and
i
will
try
my
right
by
her
alone
you
will
like
to
know
no
more
after
this
and
i
will
tell
you
no
more
now
you
know
my
purpose
and
wants
when
must
i
leave
here
a
week
said
snitchey
craggs
something
less
i
should
say
responded
craggs
a
month
said
the
client
after
attentively
watching
the
two
faces
day
month
is
thursday
succeed
or
fail
on
this
day
month
i
go
too
long
a
delay
said
snitchey
too
long
but
let
it
be
so
i
thought
he
have
stipulated
for
three
he
murmured
to
himself
you
going
good
night
sir
night
returned
the
client
shaking
hands
with
the
firm
live
to
see
me
making
a
good
use
of
riches
yet
henceforth
the
star
of
my
destiny
is
marion
care
of
the
stairs
sir
replied
snitchey
she
shine
there
good
night
night
so
they
both
stood
at
the
with
a
pair
of
watching
him
down
when
he
had
gone
away
they
stood
looking
at
each
other
do
you
think
of
all
this
mr
craggs
said
snitchey
craggs
shook
his
head
was
our
opinion
on
the
day
when
that
release
was
executed
that
there
was
something
curious
in
the
parting
of
that
pair
i
recollect
said
snitchey
was
said
craggs
he
deceives
himself
altogether
pursued
snitchey
locking
up
the
fireproof
box
and
putting
it
away
if
he
do
a
little
bit
of
fickleness
and
perfidy
is
not
a
miracle
craggs
and
yet
i
thought
that
pretty
face
was
very
true
i
thought
said
snitchey
putting
on
his
for
the
weather
was
very
cold
drawing
on
his
gloves
and
snuffing
out
one
candle
i
had
even
seen
her
character
becoming
stronger
and
more
resolved
of
late
more
like
her
sister
craggs
was
of
the
same
opinion
returned
craggs
really
give
a
trifle
observed
snitchey
who
was
a
man
i
could
believe
that
mr
warden
was
reckoning
without
his
host
but
capricious
and
unballasted
as
he
is
he
knows
something
of
the
world
and
its
people
he
ought
to
for
he
has
bought
what
he
does
know
dear
enough
and
i
ca
quite
think
that
we
had
better
not
interfere
we
can
do
nothing
craggs
but
keep
quiet
returned
craggs
friend
the
doctor
makes
light
of
such
things
said
snitchey
shaking
his
head
hope
he
may
stand
in
need
of
his
philosophy
our
friend
alfred
talks
of
the
battle
of
life
he
shook
his
head
again
hope
he
may
be
cut
down
early
in
the
day
have
you
got
your
hat
craggs
i
am
going
to
put
the
other
candle
out
craggs
replying
in
the
affirmative
snitchey
suited
the
action
to
the
word
and
they
groped
their
way
out
of
the
now
dark
as
the
subject
or
the
law
in
general
my
story
passes
to
a
quiet
little
study
where
on
that
same
night
the
sisters
and
the
hale
old
doctor
sat
by
a
cheerful
fireside
grace
was
working
at
her
needle
marion
read
aloud
from
a
book
before
her
the
doctor
in
his
and
slippers
with
his
feet
spread
out
upon
the
warm
rug
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
listened
to
the
book
and
looked
upon
his
daughters
they
were
very
beautiful
to
look
upon
two
better
faces
for
a
fireside
never
made
a
fireside
bright
and
sacred
something
of
the
difference
between
them
had
been
softened
down
in
three
time
and
enthroned
upon
the
clear
brow
of
the
younger
sister
looking
through
her
eyes
and
thrilling
in
her
voice
was
the
same
earnest
nature
that
her
own
motherless
youth
had
ripened
in
the
elder
sister
long
ago
but
she
still
appeared
at
once
the
lovelier
and
weaker
of
the
two
still
seemed
to
rest
her
head
upon
her
sister
breast
and
put
her
trust
in
her
and
look
into
her
eyes
for
counsel
and
reliance
those
loving
eyes
so
calm
serene
and
cheerful
as
of
old
and
being
in
her
own
home
read
marion
from
the
book
her
home
made
exquisitely
dear
by
these
remembrances
she
now
began
to
know
that
the
great
trial
of
her
heart
must
soon
come
on
and
could
not
be
delayed
o
home
our
comforter
and
friend
when
others
fall
away
to
part
with
whom
at
any
step
between
the
cradle
and
the
grave
my
love
said
grace
puss
exclaimed
her
father
the
matter
she
put
her
hand
upon
the
hand
her
sister
stretched
towards
her
and
read
on
her
voice
still
faltering
and
trembling
though
she
made
an
effort
to
command
it
when
thus
interrupted
to
part
with
whom
at
any
step
between
the
cradle
and
the
grave
is
always
sorrowful
o
home
so
true
to
us
so
often
slighted
in
return
be
lenient
to
them
that
turn
away
from
thee
and
do
not
haunt
their
erring
footsteps
too
reproachfully
let
no
kind
looks
no
smiles
be
seen
upon
thy
phantom
face
let
no
ray
of
affection
welcome
gentleness
forbearance
cordiality
shine
from
thy
white
head
let
no
old
loving
word
or
tone
rise
up
in
judgment
against
thy
deserter
but
if
thou
canst
look
harshly
and
severely
do
in
mercy
to
the
penitent
marion
read
no
more
said
grace
for
she
was
weeping
can
not
she
replied
and
closed
the
book
words
seem
all
on
fire
the
doctor
was
amused
at
this
and
laughed
as
he
patted
her
on
the
head
overcome
by
a
said
doctor
jeddler
and
paper
well
well
it
all
one
it
as
rational
to
make
a
serious
matter
of
print
and
paper
as
of
anything
else
but
dry
your
eyes
love
dry
your
eyes
i
dare
say
the
heroine
has
got
home
again
long
ago
and
made
it
up
all
round
and
if
she
has
a
real
home
is
only
four
walls
and
a
fictitious
one
mere
rags
and
ink
what
the
matter
now
only
me
mister
said
clemency
putting
in
her
head
at
the
door
what
the
matter
with
you
said
the
doctor
bless
you
nothing
a
the
matter
with
me
returned
clemency
and
truly
too
to
judge
from
her
face
in
which
there
gleamed
as
usual
the
very
soul
of
which
ungainly
as
she
was
made
her
quite
engaging
abrasions
on
the
elbows
are
not
generally
understood
it
is
true
to
range
within
that
class
of
personal
charms
called
but
it
is
better
going
through
the
world
to
have
the
arms
chafed
in
that
narrow
passage
than
the
temper
and
clemency
was
sound
and
whole
as
any
beauty
in
the
land
a
the
matter
with
me
said
clemency
entering
come
a
little
closer
mister
the
doctor
in
some
astonishment
complied
with
this
invitation
said
i
was
to
give
you
one
before
them
you
know
said
clemency
a
novice
in
the
family
might
have
supposed
from
her
extraordinary
ogling
as
she
said
it
as
well
as
from
a
singular
rapture
or
ecstasy
which
pervaded
her
elbows
as
if
she
were
embracing
herself
that
in
its
most
favourable
interpretation
meant
a
chaste
salute
indeed
the
doctor
himself
seemed
alarmed
for
the
moment
but
quickly
regained
his
composure
as
clemency
having
had
recourse
to
both
her
pockets
beginning
with
the
right
one
going
away
to
the
wrong
one
and
afterwards
coming
back
to
the
right
one
again
produced
a
letter
from
the
was
riding
by
on
a
errand
she
chuckled
handing
it
to
the
doctor
see
the
mail
come
in
and
waited
for
it
in
the
corner
alfred
on
his
journey
home
i
bet
we
shall
have
a
wedding
in
the
house
there
was
two
spoons
in
my
saucer
this
morning
oh
luck
how
slow
he
opens
it
all
this
she
delivered
by
way
of
soliloquy
gradually
rising
higher
and
higher
on
tiptoe
in
her
impatience
to
hear
the
news
and
making
a
corkscrew
of
her
apron
and
a
bottle
of
her
mouth
at
last
arriving
at
a
climax
of
suspense
and
seeing
the
doctor
still
engaged
in
the
perusal
of
the
letter
she
came
down
flat
upon
the
soles
of
her
feet
again
and
cast
her
apron
as
a
veil
over
her
head
in
a
mute
despair
and
inability
to
bear
it
any
longer
girls
cried
the
doctor
ca
help
it
i
never
could
keep
a
secret
in
my
life
there
are
not
many
secrets
indeed
worth
being
kept
in
such
a
well
never
mind
that
coming
home
my
dears
directly
exclaimed
marion
the
is
soon
forgotten
said
the
doctor
pinching
her
cheek
thought
the
news
would
dry
those
tears
yes
let
it
be
a
surprise
he
says
here
but
i
ca
let
it
be
a
surprise
he
must
have
a
welcome
repeated
marion
perhaps
not
what
your
impatience
calls
directly
returned
the
doctor
pretty
soon
too
let
us
see
let
us
see
is
thursday
is
it
not
then
he
promises
to
be
here
this
day
month
day
month
repeated
marion
softly
gay
day
and
a
holiday
for
us
said
the
cheerful
voice
of
her
sister
grace
kissing
her
in
congratulation
looked
forward
to
dearest
and
come
at
last
she
answered
with
a
smile
a
mournful
smile
but
full
of
sisterly
affection
as
she
looked
in
her
sister
face
and
listened
to
the
quiet
music
of
her
voice
picturing
the
happiness
of
this
return
her
own
face
glowed
with
hope
and
joy
and
with
a
something
else
a
something
shining
more
and
more
through
all
the
rest
of
its
expression
for
which
i
have
no
name
it
was
not
exultation
triumph
proud
enthusiasm
they
are
not
so
calmly
shown
it
was
not
love
and
gratitude
alone
though
love
and
gratitude
were
part
of
it
it
emanated
from
no
sordid
thought
for
sordid
thoughts
do
not
light
up
the
brow
and
hover
on
the
lips
and
move
the
spirit
like
a
fluttered
light
until
the
sympathetic
figure
trembles
jeddler
in
spite
of
his
system
of
philosophy
which
he
was
continually
contradicting
and
denying
in
practice
but
more
famous
philosophers
have
done
that
could
not
help
having
as
much
interest
in
the
return
of
his
old
ward
and
pupil
as
if
it
had
been
a
serious
event
so
he
sat
himself
down
in
his
again
stretched
out
his
slippered
feet
once
more
upon
the
rug
read
the
letter
over
and
over
a
great
many
times
and
talked
it
over
more
times
still
the
day
was
said
the
doctor
looking
at
the
fire
you
and
he
grace
used
to
trot
about
in
his
holiday
time
like
a
couple
of
walking
dolls
you
remember
remember
she
answered
with
her
pleasant
laugh
and
plying
her
needle
busily
day
month
indeed
mused
the
doctor
hardly
seems
a
twelve
month
ago
and
where
was
my
little
marion
then
far
from
her
sister
said
marion
cheerily
little
grace
was
everything
to
me
even
when
she
was
a
young
child
herself
puss
true
returned
the
doctor
was
a
staid
little
woman
was
grace
and
a
wise
housekeeper
and
a
busy
quiet
pleasant
body
bearing
with
our
humours
and
anticipating
our
wishes
and
always
ready
to
forget
her
own
even
in
those
times
i
never
knew
you
positive
or
obstinate
grace
my
darling
even
then
on
any
subject
but
one
am
afraid
i
have
changed
sadly
for
the
worse
since
laughed
grace
still
busy
at
her
work
was
that
one
father
of
course
said
the
doctor
would
serve
you
but
you
must
be
called
alfred
wife
so
we
called
you
alfred
wife
and
you
liked
it
better
i
believe
odd
as
it
seems
now
than
being
called
a
duchess
if
we
could
have
made
you
one
said
grace
placidly
do
you
remember
inquired
the
doctor
think
i
remember
something
of
it
she
returned
not
much
it
so
long
ago
and
as
she
sat
at
work
she
hummed
the
burden
of
an
old
song
which
the
doctor
liked
will
find
a
real
wife
soon
she
said
breaking
off
that
will
be
a
happy
time
indeed
for
all
of
us
my
three
trust
is
nearly
at
an
end
marion
it
has
been
a
very
easy
one
i
shall
tell
alfred
when
i
give
you
back
to
him
that
you
have
loved
him
dearly
all
the
time
and
that
he
has
never
once
needed
my
good
services
may
i
tell
him
so
love
him
dear
grace
replied
marion
there
never
was
a
trust
so
generously
nobly
steadfastly
discharged
and
that
i
have
loved
you
all
the
time
dearer
and
dearer
every
day
and
o
how
dearly
now
said
her
cheerful
sister
returning
her
embrace
can
scarcely
tell
him
that
we
will
leave
my
deserts
to
imagination
it
will
be
liberal
enough
dear
marion
like
your
own
with
that
she
resumed
the
work
she
had
for
a
moment
laid
down
when
her
sister
spoke
so
fervently
and
with
it
the
old
song
the
doctor
liked
to
hear
and
the
doctor
still
reposing
in
his
chair
with
his
slippered
feet
stretched
out
before
him
on
the
rug
listened
to
the
tune
and
beat
time
on
his
knee
with
letter
and
looked
at
his
two
daughters
and
thought
that
among
the
many
trifles
of
the
trifling
world
these
trifles
were
agreeable
enough
clemency
newcome
in
the
meantime
having
accomplished
her
mission
and
lingered
in
the
room
until
she
had
made
herself
a
party
to
the
news
descended
to
the
kitchen
where
her
coadjutor
britain
was
regaling
after
supper
surrounded
by
such
a
plentiful
collection
of
bright
saucepans
burnished
gleaming
kettles
and
other
tokens
of
her
industrious
habits
arranged
upon
the
walls
and
shelves
that
he
sat
as
in
the
centre
of
a
hall
of
mirrors
the
majority
did
not
give
forth
very
flattering
portraits
of
him
certainly
nor
were
they
by
any
means
unanimous
in
their
reflections
as
some
made
him
very
others
very
some
tolerably
looking
others
vastly
according
to
their
several
manners
of
reflecting
which
were
as
various
in
respect
of
one
fact
as
those
of
so
many
kinds
of
men
but
they
all
agreed
that
in
the
midst
of
them
sat
quite
at
his
ease
an
individual
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
a
jug
of
beer
at
his
elbow
who
nodded
condescendingly
to
clemency
when
she
stationed
herself
at
the
same
table
clemmy
said
britain
are
you
by
this
time
and
the
news
clemency
told
him
the
news
which
he
received
very
graciously
a
gracious
change
had
come
over
benjamin
from
head
to
foot
he
was
much
broader
much
redder
much
more
cheerful
and
much
jollier
in
all
respects
it
seemed
as
if
his
face
had
been
tied
up
in
a
knot
before
and
was
now
untwisted
and
smoothed
out
be
another
job
for
snitchey
and
craggs
i
suppose
he
observed
puffing
slowly
at
his
pipe
witnessing
for
you
and
me
perhaps
clemmy
replied
his
fair
companion
with
her
favourite
twist
of
her
favourite
joints
wish
it
was
me
britain
what
was
you
to
be
married
said
clemency
benjamin
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
laughed
heartily
you
a
likely
subject
for
that
he
said
clem
clemency
for
her
part
laughed
as
heartily
as
he
and
seemed
as
much
amused
by
the
idea
she
assented
a
likely
subject
for
that
a
i
never
be
married
you
know
said
britain
resuming
his
pipe
you
think
i
ever
shall
though
said
clemency
in
perfect
good
faith
britain
shook
his
head
a
chance
of
it
think
said
clemency
i
suppose
you
mean
to
britain
one
of
these
days
do
you
a
question
so
abrupt
upon
a
subject
so
momentous
required
consideration
after
blowing
out
a
great
cloud
of
smoke
and
looking
at
it
with
his
head
now
on
this
side
and
now
on
that
as
if
it
were
actually
the
question
and
he
were
surveying
it
in
various
aspects
britain
replied
that
he
was
altogether
clear
about
it
but
he
thought
he
might
come
to
that
at
last
wish
her
joy
whoever
she
may
be
cried
clemency
she
have
that
said
benjamin
enough
she
would
have
led
quite
such
a
joyful
life
as
she
will
lead
and
would
have
had
quite
such
a
sociable
sort
of
husband
as
she
will
have
said
clemency
spreading
herself
half
over
the
table
and
staring
retrospectively
at
the
candle
it
been
for
not
that
i
went
to
do
it
for
it
was
accidental
i
am
sure
if
it
had
been
for
me
now
would
she
britain
not
returned
britain
by
this
time
in
that
high
state
of
appreciation
of
his
pipe
when
a
man
can
open
his
mouth
but
a
very
little
way
for
speaking
purposes
and
sitting
luxuriously
immovable
in
his
chair
can
afford
to
turn
only
his
eyes
towards
a
companion
and
that
very
passively
and
gravely
i
greatly
beholden
to
you
you
know
clem
how
nice
that
is
to
think
of
said
clemency
at
the
same
time
bringing
her
thoughts
as
well
as
her
sight
to
bear
upon
the
and
becoming
abruptly
reminiscent
of
its
healing
qualities
as
a
balsam
she
anointed
her
left
elbow
with
a
plentiful
application
of
that
remedy
see
i
made
a
good
many
investigations
of
one
sort
and
another
in
my
time
pursued
britain
with
the
profundity
of
a
sage
been
always
of
an
inquiring
turn
of
mind
and
read
a
good
many
books
about
the
general
rights
of
things
and
wrongs
of
things
for
i
went
into
the
literary
line
myself
when
i
began
life
you
though
cried
the
admiring
clemency
said
britain
was
hid
for
the
best
part
of
two
years
behind
a
bookstall
ready
to
fly
out
if
anybody
pocketed
a
volume
and
after
that
i
was
light
porter
to
a
stay
and
mantua
maker
in
which
capacity
i
was
employed
to
carry
about
in
oilskin
baskets
nothing
but
deceptions
which
soured
my
spirits
and
disturbed
my
confidence
in
human
nature
and
after
that
i
heard
a
world
of
discussions
in
this
house
which
soured
my
spirits
fresh
and
my
opinion
after
all
is
that
as
a
safe
and
comfortable
sweetener
of
the
same
and
as
a
pleasant
guide
through
life
there
nothing
like
a
clemency
was
about
to
offer
a
suggestion
but
he
stopped
her
by
anticipating
it
he
added
gravely
a
thimble
as
you
wold
you
know
and
cetrer
eh
observed
clemency
folding
her
arms
comfortably
in
her
delight
at
this
avowal
and
patting
her
elbows
a
short
cut
a
it
not
sure
said
britain
it
what
would
be
considered
good
philosophy
i
my
doubts
about
that
but
it
wears
well
and
saves
a
quantity
of
snarling
which
the
genuine
article
do
always
how
you
used
to
go
on
once
yourself
you
know
said
clemency
said
britain
the
most
extraordinary
thing
clemmy
is
that
i
should
live
to
be
brought
round
through
you
that
the
strange
part
of
it
through
you
why
i
suppose
you
have
so
much
as
half
an
idea
in
your
head
clemency
without
taking
the
least
offence
shook
it
and
laughed
and
hugged
herself
and
said
she
did
suppose
she
had
pretty
sure
of
it
said
britain
i
dare
say
you
right
said
clemency
do
pretend
to
none
i
do
want
any
benjamin
took
his
pipe
from
his
lips
and
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
his
face
a
natural
you
are
clemmy
he
said
shaking
his
head
with
an
infinite
relish
of
the
joke
and
wiping
his
eyes
clemency
without
the
smallest
inclination
to
dispute
it
did
the
like
and
laughed
as
heartily
as
he
ca
help
liking
you
said
britain
a
regular
good
creature
in
your
way
so
shake
hands
clem
whatever
happens
always
take
notice
of
you
and
be
a
friend
to
you
you
returned
clemency
that
very
good
of
you
yes
said
britain
giving
her
his
pipe
to
knock
the
ashes
out
of
it
stand
by
you
hark
that
a
curious
noise
repeated
clemency
footstep
outside
somebody
dropping
from
the
wall
it
sounded
like
said
britain
they
all
abed
all
abed
by
this
time
she
replied
you
hear
anything
they
both
listened
but
heard
nothing
tell
you
what
said
benjamin
taking
down
a
lantern
have
a
look
round
before
i
go
to
bed
myself
for
sake
undo
the
door
while
i
light
this
clemmy
clemency
complied
briskly
but
observed
as
she
did
so
that
he
would
only
have
his
walk
for
his
pains
that
it
was
all
his
fancy
and
so
forth
britain
said
likely
but
sallied
out
nevertheless
armed
with
the
poker
and
casting
the
light
of
the
lantern
far
and
near
in
all
directions
as
quiet
as
a
churchyard
said
clemency
looking
after
him
almost
as
ghostly
too
glancing
back
into
the
kitchen
she
cried
fearfully
as
a
light
figure
stole
into
her
view
that
said
marion
in
an
agitated
whisper
have
always
loved
me
have
you
not
you
child
you
may
be
sure
i
have
am
sure
and
i
may
trust
you
may
i
not
there
is
no
one
else
just
now
in
whom
i
can
trust
said
clemency
with
all
her
heart
is
some
one
out
there
pointing
to
the
door
i
must
see
and
speak
with
michael
warden
for
god
sake
retire
not
now
clemency
started
with
surprise
and
trouble
as
following
the
direction
of
the
speaker
eyes
she
saw
a
dark
figure
standing
in
the
doorway
another
moment
you
may
be
discovered
said
marion
now
wait
if
you
can
in
some
concealment
i
will
come
presently
he
waved
his
hand
to
her
and
was
gone
go
to
bed
wait
here
for
me
said
marion
hurriedly
have
been
seeking
to
speak
to
you
for
an
hour
past
oh
be
true
to
me
eagerly
seizing
her
bewildered
hand
and
pressing
it
with
both
her
own
to
her
breast
an
action
more
expressive
in
its
passion
of
entreaty
than
the
most
eloquent
appeal
in
words
marion
withdrew
as
the
light
of
the
returning
lantern
flashed
into
the
room
still
and
peaceable
nobody
there
fancy
i
suppose
said
britain
as
he
locked
and
barred
the
door
of
the
effects
of
having
a
lively
imagination
halloa
why
what
the
matter
clemency
who
could
not
conceal
the
effects
of
her
surprise
and
concern
was
sitting
in
a
chair
pale
and
trembling
from
head
to
foot
she
repeated
chafing
her
hands
and
elbows
nervously
and
looking
anywhere
but
at
him
good
in
you
britain
that
is
after
going
and
frightening
one
out
of
one
life
with
noises
and
lanterns
and
i
do
know
what
all
matter
oh
yes
you
frightened
out
of
your
life
by
a
lantern
clemmy
said
britain
composedly
blowing
it
out
and
hanging
it
up
again
apparition
very
soon
got
rid
of
but
you
as
bold
as
brass
in
general
he
said
stopping
to
observe
her
were
after
the
noise
and
the
lantern
too
what
have
you
taken
into
your
head
not
an
idea
eh
but
as
clemency
bade
him
good
night
very
much
after
her
usual
fashion
and
began
to
bustle
about
with
a
show
of
going
to
bed
herself
immediately
little
britain
after
giving
utterance
to
the
original
remark
that
it
was
impossible
to
account
for
a
whims
bade
her
good
night
in
return
and
taking
up
his
candle
strolled
drowsily
away
to
bed
when
all
was
quiet
marion
returned
the
door
she
said
stand
there
close
beside
me
while
i
speak
to
him
outside
timid
as
her
manner
was
it
still
evinced
a
resolute
and
settled
purpose
such
as
clemency
could
not
resist
she
softly
unbarred
the
door
but
before
turning
the
key
looked
round
on
the
young
creature
waiting
to
issue
forth
when
she
should
open
it
the
face
was
not
averted
or
cast
down
but
looking
full
upon
her
in
its
pride
of
youth
and
beauty
some
simple
sense
of
the
slightness
of
the
barrier
that
interposed
itself
between
the
happy
home
and
honoured
love
of
the
fair
girl
and
what
might
be
the
desolation
of
that
home
and
shipwreck
of
its
dearest
treasure
smote
so
keenly
on
the
tender
heart
of
clemency
and
so
filled
it
to
overflowing
with
sorrow
and
compassion
that
bursting
into
tears
she
threw
her
arms
round
marion
neck
little
that
i
know
my
dear
cried
clemency
little
but
i
know
that
this
should
not
be
think
of
what
you
do
have
thought
of
it
many
times
said
marion
gently
more
urged
clemency
marion
shook
her
head
alfred
sake
said
clemency
with
homely
earnestness
that
you
used
to
love
so
dearly
once
she
hid
her
face
upon
the
instant
in
her
hands
repeating
as
if
it
rent
her
heart
me
go
out
said
clemency
soothing
her
tell
him
what
you
like
do
cross
the
i
sure
no
good
will
come
of
it
oh
it
was
an
unhappy
day
when
mr
warden
was
ever
brought
here
think
of
your
good
father
darling
of
your
sister
have
said
marion
hastily
raising
her
head
do
know
what
i
do
i
must
speak
to
him
you
are
the
best
and
truest
friend
in
all
the
world
for
what
you
have
said
to
me
but
i
must
take
this
step
will
you
go
with
me
clemency
she
kissed
her
on
her
friendly
face
shall
i
go
alone
sorrowing
and
wondering
clemency
turned
the
key
and
opened
the
door
into
the
dark
and
doubtful
night
that
lay
beyond
the
threshold
marion
passed
quickly
holding
by
her
hand
in
the
dark
night
he
joined
her
and
they
spoke
together
earnestly
and
long
and
the
hand
that
held
so
fast
by
clemency
now
trembled
now
turned
deadly
cold
now
clasped
and
closed
on
hers
in
the
strong
feeling
of
the
speech
it
emphasised
unconsciously
when
they
returned
he
followed
to
the
door
and
pausing
there
a
moment
seized
the
other
hand
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
then
stealthily
withdrew
the
door
was
barred
and
locked
again
and
once
again
she
stood
beneath
her
father
roof
not
bowed
down
by
the
secret
that
she
brought
there
though
so
young
but
with
that
same
expression
on
her
face
for
which
i
had
no
name
before
and
shining
through
her
tears
again
she
thanked
and
thanked
her
humble
friend
and
trusted
to
her
as
she
said
with
confidence
implicitly
her
chamber
safely
reached
she
fell
upon
her
knees
and
with
her
secret
weighing
on
her
heart
could
pray
could
rise
up
from
her
prayers
so
tranquil
and
serene
and
bending
over
her
fond
sister
in
her
slumber
look
upon
her
face
and
smile
though
sadly
murmuring
as
she
kissed
her
forehead
how
that
grace
had
been
a
mother
to
her
ever
and
she
loved
her
as
a
child
could
draw
the
passive
arm
about
her
neck
when
lying
down
to
rest
it
seemed
to
cling
there
of
its
own
will
protectingly
and
tenderly
even
in
sleep
and
breathe
upon
the
parted
lips
god
bless
her
could
sink
into
a
peaceful
sleep
herself
but
for
one
dream
in
which
she
cried
out
in
her
innocent
and
touching
voice
that
she
was
quite
alone
and
they
had
all
forgotten
her
a
month
soon
passes
even
at
its
tardiest
pace
the
month
appointed
to
elapse
between
that
night
and
the
return
was
quick
of
foot
and
went
by
like
a
vapour
the
day
arrived
a
raging
winter
day
that
shook
the
old
house
sometimes
as
if
it
shivered
in
the
blast
a
day
to
make
home
doubly
home
to
give
the
new
delights
to
shed
a
ruddier
glow
upon
the
faces
gathered
round
the
hearth
and
draw
each
fireside
group
into
a
closer
and
more
social
league
against
the
roaring
elements
without
such
a
wild
winter
day
as
best
prepares
the
way
for
night
for
curtained
rooms
and
cheerful
looks
for
music
laughter
dancing
light
and
jovial
entertainment
all
these
the
doctor
had
in
store
to
welcome
alfred
back
they
knew
that
he
could
not
arrive
till
night
and
they
would
make
the
night
air
ring
he
said
as
he
approached
all
his
old
friends
should
congregate
about
him
he
should
not
miss
a
face
that
he
had
known
and
liked
no
they
should
every
one
be
there
so
guests
were
bidden
and
musicians
were
engaged
and
tables
spread
and
floors
prepared
for
active
feet
and
bountiful
provision
made
of
every
hospitable
kind
because
it
was
the
christmas
season
and
his
eyes
were
all
unused
to
english
holly
and
its
sturdy
green
the
was
garlanded
and
hung
with
it
and
the
red
berries
gleamed
an
english
welcome
to
him
peeping
from
among
the
leaves
it
was
a
busy
day
for
all
of
them
a
busier
day
for
none
of
them
than
grace
who
noiselessly
presided
everywhere
and
was
the
cheerful
mind
of
all
the
preparations
many
a
time
that
day
as
well
as
many
a
time
within
the
fleeting
month
preceding
it
did
clemency
glance
anxiously
and
almost
fearfully
at
marion
she
saw
her
paler
perhaps
than
usual
but
there
was
a
sweet
composure
on
her
face
that
made
it
lovelier
than
ever
at
night
when
she
was
dressed
and
wore
upon
her
head
a
wreath
that
grace
had
proudly
twined
about
it
its
mimic
flowers
were
favourites
as
grace
remembered
when
she
chose
them
that
old
expression
pensive
almost
sorrowful
and
yet
so
spiritual
high
and
stirring
sat
again
upon
her
brow
enhanced
a
next
wreath
i
adjust
on
this
fair
head
will
be
a
marriage
wreath
said
grace
i
am
no
true
prophet
dear
her
sister
smiled
and
held
her
in
her
arms
moment
grace
do
leave
me
yet
are
you
sure
that
i
want
nothing
more
her
care
was
not
for
that
it
was
her
sister
face
she
thought
of
and
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
it
tenderly
art
said
grace
go
no
farther
dear
girl
nor
your
beauty
i
never
saw
you
look
so
beautiful
as
now
never
was
so
happy
she
returned
but
there
is
a
greater
happiness
in
store
in
such
another
home
as
cheerful
and
as
bright
as
this
looks
now
said
grace
and
his
young
wife
will
soon
be
living
she
smiled
again
is
a
happy
home
grace
in
your
fancy
i
can
see
it
in
your
eyes
i
know
it
will
be
happy
dear
how
glad
i
am
to
know
it
cried
the
doctor
bustling
in
we
are
all
ready
for
alfred
eh
he
ca
be
here
until
pretty
late
an
hour
or
so
before
midnight
so
there
be
plenty
of
time
for
making
merry
before
he
comes
he
not
find
us
with
the
ice
unbroken
pile
up
the
fire
here
britain
let
it
shine
upon
the
holly
till
it
winks
again
it
a
world
of
nonsense
puss
true
lovers
and
all
the
rest
of
it
all
nonsense
but
we
be
nonsensical
with
the
rest
of
and
give
our
true
lover
a
mad
welcome
upon
my
word
said
the
old
doctor
looking
at
his
daughters
proudly
not
clear
among
other
absurdities
but
that
i
the
father
of
two
handsome
girls
that
one
of
them
has
ever
done
or
may
do
may
do
dearest
father
to
cause
you
pain
or
grief

said
marion
her
now
when
her
heart
is
full
say
that
you
forgive
her
that
you
will
forgive
her
that
she
shall
always
share
your
love
and
and
the
rest
was
not
said
for
her
face
was
hidden
on
the
old
man
shoulder
tut
tut
said
the
doctor
gently
what
have
i
to
forgive
heyday
if
our
true
lovers
come
back
to
flurry
us
like
this
we
must
hold
at
a
distance
we
must
send
expresses
out
to
stop
short
upon
the
road
and
bring
on
a
mile
or
two
a
day
until
we
properly
prepared
to
meet
kiss
me
puss
forgive
why
what
a
silly
child
you
are
if
you
had
vexed
and
crossed
me
fifty
times
a
day
instead
of
not
at
all
i
forgive
you
everything
but
such
a
supplication
kiss
me
again
puss
there
prospective
and
retrospective
a
clear
score
between
us
pile
up
the
fire
here
would
you
freeze
the
people
on
this
bleak
december
night
let
us
be
light
and
warm
and
merry
or
i
not
forgive
some
of
you
so
gaily
the
old
doctor
carried
it
and
the
fire
was
piled
up
and
the
lights
were
bright
and
company
arrived
and
a
murmuring
of
lively
tongues
began
and
already
there
was
a
pleasant
air
of
cheerful
excitement
stirring
through
all
the
house
more
and
more
company
came
flocking
in
bright
eyes
sparkled
upon
marion
smiling
lips
gave
her
joy
of
his
return
sage
mothers
fanned
themselves
and
hoped
she
might
be
too
youthful
and
inconstant
for
the
quiet
round
of
home
impetuous
fathers
fell
into
disgrace
for
too
much
exaltation
of
her
beauty
daughters
envied
her
sons
envied
him
innumerable
pairs
of
lovers
profited
by
the
occasion
all
were
interested
animated
and
expectant
and
craggs
came
arm
in
arm
but
snitchey
came
alone
what
become
of
him
inquired
the
doctor
the
feather
of
a
bird
of
paradise
in
snitchey
turban
trembled
as
if
the
bird
of
paradise
were
alive
again
when
she
said
that
doubtless
craggs
knew
she
was
never
told
nasty
office
said
craggs
wish
it
was
burnt
down
said
snitchey
he
there
a
little
matter
of
business
that
keeps
my
partner
rather
late
said
craggs
looking
uneasily
about
him
business
do
tell
me
said
snitchey
know
what
business
means
said
craggs
but
their
not
knowing
what
it
meant
was
perhaps
the
reason
why
snitchey
bird
of
paradise
feather
quivered
so
portentously
and
why
all
the
pendant
bits
on
craggs
shook
like
little
bells
wonder
you
could
come
away
craggs
said
his
wife
craggs
is
fortunate
i
sure
said
snitchey
office
so
engrosses
said
craggs
person
with
an
office
has
no
business
to
be
married
at
all
said
snitchey
then
snitchey
said
within
herself
that
that
look
of
hers
had
pierced
to
craggs
soul
and
he
knew
it
and
craggs
observed
to
craggs
that
snitcheys
were
deceiving
him
behind
his
back
and
he
would
find
it
out
when
it
was
too
late
still
craggs
without
much
heeding
these
remarks
looked
uneasily
about
until
his
eye
rested
on
grace
to
whom
he
immediately
presented
himself
evening
said
craggs
look
charmingly
your
miss
your
sister
miss
marion
is
she
she
quite
well
mr
craggs
i
is
she
here
asked
craggs
do
you
see
her
yonder
going
to
dance
said
grace
craggs
put
on
his
spectacles
to
see
the
better
looked
at
her
through
them
for
some
time
coughed
and
put
them
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
in
their
sheath
again
and
in
his
pocket
now
the
music
struck
up
and
the
dance
commenced
the
bright
fire
crackled
and
sparkled
rose
and
fell
as
though
it
joined
the
dance
itself
in
right
good
fellowship
sometimes
it
roared
as
if
it
would
make
music
too
sometimes
it
flashed
and
beamed
as
if
it
were
the
eye
of
the
old
room
it
winked
too
sometimes
like
a
knowing
patriarch
upon
the
youthful
whisperers
in
corners
sometimes
it
sported
with
the
and
shining
on
the
leaves
by
fits
and
starts
made
them
look
as
if
they
were
in
the
cold
winter
night
again
and
fluttering
in
the
wind
sometimes
its
genial
humour
grew
obstreperous
and
passed
all
bounds
and
then
it
cast
into
the
room
among
the
twinkling
feet
with
a
loud
burst
a
shower
of
harmless
little
sparks
and
in
its
exultation
leaped
and
bounded
like
a
mad
thing
up
the
broad
old
chimney
another
dance
was
near
its
close
when
snitchey
touched
his
partner
who
was
looking
on
upon
the
arm
craggs
started
as
if
his
familiar
had
been
a
spectre
he
gone
he
asked
he
has
been
with
me
said
snitchey
three
hours
and
more
he
went
over
everything
he
looked
into
all
our
arrangements
for
him
and
was
very
particular
indeed
he
humph
the
dance
was
finished
marion
passed
close
before
him
as
he
spoke
she
did
not
observe
him
or
his
partner
but
looked
over
her
shoulder
towards
her
sister
in
the
distance
as
she
slowly
made
her
way
into
the
crowd
and
passed
out
of
their
view
see
all
safe
and
well
said
craggs
did
recur
to
that
subject
i
suppose
a
word
is
he
really
gone
is
he
safe
away
keeps
to
his
word
he
drops
down
the
river
with
the
tide
in
that
shell
of
a
boat
of
his
and
so
goes
out
to
sea
on
this
dark
night
a
he
is
before
the
wind
there
no
such
lonely
road
anywhere
else
that
one
thing
the
tide
flows
he
says
an
hour
before
midnight
about
this
time
i
glad
over
snitchey
wiped
his
forehead
which
looked
hot
and
anxious
do
you
think
said
craggs
replied
his
cautious
partner
looking
straight
before
him
understand
you
do
mention
names
and
do
let
us
seem
to
be
talking
secrets
i
do
know
what
to
think
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
care
now
it
a
great
relief
his
deceived
him
i
suppose
perhaps
the
young
lady
coquetted
a
little
the
evidence
would
seem
to
point
that
way
alfred
not
arrived
yet
said
craggs
every
minute
snitchey
wiped
his
forehead
again
a
great
relief
i
have
been
so
nervous
since
we
been
in
partnership
i
intend
to
spend
the
evening
now
mr
craggs
craggs
and
snitchey
joined
them
as
he
announced
this
intention
the
bird
of
paradise
was
in
a
state
of
extreme
vibration
and
the
little
bells
were
ringing
quite
audibly
has
been
the
theme
of
general
comment
snitchey
said
snitchey
hope
the
office
is
satisfied
with
what
my
dear
asked
snitchey
the
exposure
of
a
defenceless
woman
to
ridicule
and
remark
returned
his
wife
is
quite
in
the
way
of
the
office
that
is
really
myself
said
craggs
been
so
long
accustomed
to
connect
the
office
with
everything
opposed
to
domesticity
that
i
am
glad
to
know
it
as
the
avowed
enemy
of
my
peace
there
is
something
honest
in
that
at
all
events
dear
urged
craggs
good
opinion
is
invaluable
but
i
never
avowed
that
the
office
was
the
enemy
of
your
peace
said
craggs
ringing
a
perfect
peal
upon
the
little
bells
you
indeed
you
would
be
worthy
of
the
office
if
you
had
the
candour
to
to
my
having
been
away
my
dear
said
snitchey
giving
her
his
arm
deprivation
has
been
mine
i
sure
but
as
craggs
knows
snitchey
cut
this
reference
very
short
by
hitching
her
husband
to
a
distance
and
asking
him
to
look
at
that
man
to
do
her
the
favour
to
look
at
him
which
man
my
dear
said
snitchey
chosen
companion
i
no
companion
to
you
mr
snitchey
yes
you
are
my
dear
he
interposed
no
i
not
said
snitchey
with
a
majestic
smile
know
my
station
will
you
look
at
your
chosen
companion
snitchey
at
your
referee
at
the
keeper
of
your
secrets
at
the
man
you
trust
at
your
other
self
in
short
the
habitual
association
of
self
with
craggs
occasioned
snitchey
to
look
in
that
direction
you
can
look
that
man
in
the
eye
this
night
said
snitchey
not
know
that
you
are
deluded
practised
upon
made
the
victim
of
his
arts
and
bent
down
prostrate
to
his
will
by
some
unaccountable
fascination
which
it
is
impossible
to
explain
and
against
which
no
warning
of
mine
is
of
the
least
avail
all
i
can
say
is
i
pity
you
at
the
very
same
moment
craggs
was
oracular
on
the
cross
subject
was
it
possible
she
said
that
craggs
could
so
blind
himself
to
his
snitcheys
as
not
to
feel
his
true
position
did
he
mean
to
say
that
he
had
seen
his
snitcheys
come
into
that
room
and
did
plainly
see
that
there
was
reservation
cunning
treachery
in
the
man
would
he
tell
her
that
his
very
action
when
he
wiped
his
forehead
and
looked
so
stealthily
about
him
did
show
that
there
was
something
weighing
on
the
conscience
of
his
precious
snitcheys
if
he
had
a
conscience
that
would
bear
the
light
did
anybody
but
his
snitcheys
come
to
festive
entertainments
like
a
burglar
which
by
the
way
was
hardly
a
clear
illustration
of
the
case
as
he
had
walked
in
very
mildly
at
the
door
and
would
he
still
assert
to
her
at
it
being
nearly
midnight
that
his
snitcheys
were
to
be
justified
through
thick
and
thin
against
all
facts
and
reason
and
experience
neither
snitchey
nor
craggs
openly
attempted
to
stem
the
current
which
had
thus
set
in
but
both
were
content
to
be
carried
gently
along
it
until
its
force
abated
this
happened
at
about
the
same
time
as
a
general
movement
for
a
country
dance
when
snitchey
proposed
himself
as
a
partner
to
craggs
and
craggs
gallantly
offered
himself
to
snitchey
and
after
some
such
slight
evasions
as
do
you
ask
somebody
else
and
be
glad
i
know
if
i
decline
and
wonder
you
can
dance
out
of
the
office
but
this
jocosely
now
each
lady
graciously
accepted
and
took
her
place
it
was
an
old
custom
among
them
indeed
to
do
so
and
to
pair
off
in
like
manner
at
dinners
and
suppers
for
they
were
excellent
friends
and
on
a
footing
of
easy
familiarity
perhaps
the
false
craggs
and
the
wicked
snitchey
were
a
recognised
fiction
with
the
two
wives
as
doe
and
roe
incessantly
running
up
and
down
bailiwicks
were
with
the
two
husbands
or
perhaps
the
ladies
had
instituted
and
taken
upon
themselves
these
two
shares
in
the
business
rather
than
be
left
out
of
it
altogether
but
certain
it
is
that
each
wife
went
as
gravely
and
steadily
to
work
in
her
vocation
as
her
husband
did
in
his
and
would
have
considered
it
almost
impossible
for
the
firm
to
maintain
a
successful
and
respectable
existence
without
her
laudable
exertions
but
now
the
bird
of
paradise
was
seen
to
flutter
down
the
middle
and
the
little
bells
began
to
bounce
and
jingle
in
poussette
and
the
doctor
rosy
face
spun
round
and
round
like
an
expressive
pegtop
highly
varnished
and
breathless
craggs
began
to
doubt
already
whether
country
dancing
had
been
made
easy
like
the
rest
of
life
and
snitchey
with
his
nimble
cuts
and
capers
footed
it
for
self
and
craggs
and
more
now
too
the
fire
took
fresh
courage
favoured
by
the
lively
wind
the
dance
awakened
and
burnt
clear
and
high
it
was
the
genius
of
the
room
and
present
everywhere
it
shone
in
people
eyes
it
sparkled
in
the
jewels
on
the
snowy
necks
of
girls
it
twinkled
at
their
ears
as
if
it
whispered
to
them
slyly
it
flashed
about
their
waists
it
flickered
on
the
ground
and
made
it
rosy
for
their
feet
it
bloomed
upon
the
ceiling
that
its
glow
might
set
off
their
bright
faces
and
it
kindled
up
a
general
illumination
in
craggs
little
belfry
now
too
the
lively
air
that
fanned
it
grew
less
gentle
as
the
music
quickened
and
the
dance
proceeded
with
new
spirit
and
a
breeze
arose
that
made
the
leaves
and
berries
dance
upon
the
wall
as
they
had
often
done
upon
the
trees
and
the
breeze
rustled
in
the
room
as
if
an
invisible
company
of
fairies
treading
in
the
of
the
good
substantial
revellers
were
whirling
after
them
now
too
no
feature
of
the
doctor
face
could
be
distinguished
as
he
spun
and
spun
and
now
there
seemed
a
dozen
birds
of
paradise
in
fitful
flight
and
now
there
were
a
thousand
little
bells
at
work
and
now
a
fleet
of
flying
skirts
was
ruffled
by
a
little
tempest
when
the
music
gave
in
and
the
dance
was
over
hot
and
breathless
as
the
doctor
was
it
only
made
him
the
more
impatient
for
alfred
coming
been
seen
britain
anything
been
heard
dark
to
see
far
sir
too
much
noise
inside
the
house
to
hear
right
the
gayer
welcome
for
him
how
goes
the
time
twelve
sir
he
ca
be
long
sir
up
the
fire
and
throw
another
log
upon
it
said
the
doctor
him
see
his
welcome
blazing
out
upon
the
night
good
boy
as
he
comes
along
he
saw
it
yes
from
the
chaise
he
caught
the
light
as
he
turned
the
corner
by
the
old
church
he
knew
the
room
from
which
it
shone
he
saw
the
wintry
branches
of
the
old
trees
between
the
light
and
him
he
knew
that
one
of
those
trees
rustled
musically
in
the
summer
time
at
the
window
of
marion
chamber
the
tears
were
in
his
eyes
his
heart
throbbed
so
violently
that
he
could
hardly
bear
his
happiness
how
often
he
had
thought
of
this
time
pictured
it
under
all
circumstances
feared
that
it
might
never
come
yearned
and
wearied
for
it
far
away
again
the
light
distinct
and
ruddy
kindled
he
knew
to
give
him
welcome
and
to
speed
him
home
he
beckoned
with
his
hand
and
waved
his
hat
and
cheered
out
loud
as
if
the
light
were
they
and
they
could
see
and
hear
him
as
he
dashed
towards
them
through
the
mud
and
mire
triumphantly
stop
he
knew
the
doctor
and
understood
what
he
had
done
he
would
not
let
it
be
a
surprise
to
them
but
he
could
make
it
one
yet
by
going
forward
on
foot
if
the
were
open
he
could
enter
there
if
not
the
wall
was
easily
climbed
as
he
knew
of
old
and
he
would
be
among
them
in
an
instant
he
dismounted
from
the
chaise
and
telling
the
driver
even
that
was
not
easy
in
his
agitation
to
remain
behind
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
to
follow
slowly
ran
on
with
exceeding
swiftness
tried
the
gate
scaled
the
wall
jumped
down
on
the
other
side
and
stood
panting
in
the
old
orchard
there
was
a
frosty
rime
upon
the
trees
which
in
the
faint
light
of
the
clouded
moon
hung
upon
the
smaller
branches
like
dead
garlands
withered
leaves
crackled
and
snapped
beneath
his
feet
as
he
crept
softly
on
towards
the
house
the
desolation
of
a
winter
night
sat
brooding
on
the
earth
and
in
the
sky
but
the
red
light
came
cheerily
towards
him
from
the
windows
figures
passed
and
repassed
there
and
the
hum
and
murmur
of
voices
greeted
his
ear
sweetly
listening
for
hers
attempting
as
he
crept
on
to
detach
it
from
the
rest
and
half
believing
that
he
heard
it
he
had
nearly
reached
the
door
when
it
was
abruptly
opened
and
a
figure
coming
out
encountered
his
it
instantly
recoiled
with
a
cry
he
said
you
know
me
come
in
she
answered
pushing
him
back
away
ask
me
why
do
come
in
is
the
matter
he
exclaimed
do
know
i
i
am
afraid
to
think
go
back
hark
there
was
a
sudden
tumult
in
the
house
she
put
her
hands
upon
her
ears
a
wild
scream
such
as
no
hands
could
shut
out
was
heard
and
grace
distraction
in
her
looks
and
manner
rushed
out
at
the
door
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
is
it
is
she
dead
she
disengaged
herself
as
if
to
recognise
his
face
and
fell
down
at
his
feet
a
crowd
of
figures
came
about
them
from
the
house
among
them
was
her
father
with
a
paper
in
his
hand
is
it
cried
alfred
grasping
his
hair
with
his
hands
and
looking
in
an
agony
from
face
to
face
as
he
bent
upon
his
knee
beside
the
insensible
girl
no
one
look
at
me
will
no
one
speak
to
me
does
no
one
know
me
is
there
no
voice
among
you
all
to
tell
me
what
it
is
there
was
a
murmur
among
them
is
gone
he
echoed
my
dear
alfred
said
the
doctor
in
a
broken
voice
and
with
his
hands
before
his
face
from
her
home
and
us
night
she
writes
that
she
has
made
her
innocent
and
blameless
choice
entreats
that
we
will
forgive
her
prays
that
we
will
not
forget
her
and
is
gone
whom
where
he
started
up
as
if
to
follow
in
pursuit
but
when
they
gave
way
to
let
him
pass
looked
wildly
round
upon
them
staggered
back
and
sunk
down
in
his
former
attitude
clasping
one
of
grace
cold
hands
in
his
own
there
was
a
hurried
running
to
and
fro
confusion
noise
disorder
and
no
purpose
some
proceeded
to
disperse
themselves
about
the
roads
and
some
took
horse
and
some
got
lights
and
some
conversed
together
urging
that
there
was
no
trace
or
track
to
follow
some
approached
him
kindly
with
the
view
of
offering
consolation
some
admonished
him
that
grace
must
be
removed
into
the
house
and
that
he
prevented
it
he
never
heard
them
and
he
never
moved
the
snow
fell
fast
and
thick
he
looked
up
for
a
moment
in
the
air
and
thought
that
those
white
ashes
strewn
upon
his
hopes
and
misery
were
suited
to
them
well
he
looked
round
on
the
whitening
ground
and
thought
how
marion
would
be
hushed
and
covered
up
as
soon
as
made
and
even
that
remembrance
of
her
blotted
out
but
he
never
felt
the
weather
and
he
never
stirred
chapter
iii
part
the
third
the
world
had
grown
six
years
older
since
that
night
of
the
return
it
was
a
warm
autumn
afternoon
and
there
had
been
heavy
rain
the
sun
burst
suddenly
from
among
the
clouds
and
the
old
ground
sparkling
brilliantly
and
cheerfully
at
sight
of
it
in
one
green
place
flashed
a
responsive
welcome
there
which
spread
along
the
country
side
as
if
a
joyful
beacon
had
been
lighted
up
and
answered
from
a
thousand
stations
how
beautiful
the
landscape
kindling
in
the
light
and
that
luxuriant
influence
passing
on
like
a
celestial
presence
brightening
everything
the
wood
a
sombre
mass
before
revealed
its
varied
tints
of
yellow
green
brown
red
its
different
forms
of
trees
with
raindrops
glittering
on
their
leaves
and
twinkling
as
they
fell
the
verdant
bright
and
glowing
seemed
as
if
it
had
been
blind
a
minute
since
and
now
had
found
a
sense
of
sight
wherewith
to
look
up
at
the
shining
sky
fences
homesteads
and
clustered
roofs
the
steeple
of
the
church
the
stream
the
all
sprang
out
of
the
gloomy
darkness
smiling
birds
sang
sweetly
flowers
raised
their
drooping
heads
fresh
scents
arose
from
the
invigorated
ground
the
blue
expanse
above
extended
and
diffused
itself
already
the
slanting
rays
pierced
mortally
the
sullen
bank
of
cloud
that
lingered
in
its
flight
and
a
rainbow
spirit
of
all
the
colours
that
adorned
the
earth
and
sky
spanned
the
whole
arch
with
its
triumphant
glory
at
such
a
time
one
little
roadside
inn
snugly
sheltered
behind
a
great
with
a
rare
seat
for
idlers
encircling
its
capacious
bole
addressed
a
cheerful
front
towards
the
traveller
as
a
house
of
entertainment
ought
and
tempted
him
with
many
mute
but
significant
assurances
of
a
comfortable
welcome
the
ruddy
board
perched
up
in
the
tree
with
its
golden
letters
winking
in
the
sun
ogled
the
from
among
the
green
leaves
like
a
jolly
face
and
promised
good
cheer
the
full
of
clear
fresh
water
and
the
ground
below
it
sprinkled
with
droppings
of
fragrant
hay
made
every
horse
that
passed
prick
up
his
ears
the
crimson
curtains
in
the
lower
rooms
and
the
pure
white
hangings
in
the
little
above
beckoned
come
in
with
every
breath
of
air
upon
the
bright
green
shutters
there
were
golden
legends
about
beer
and
ale
and
neat
wines
and
good
beds
and
an
affecting
picture
of
a
brown
jug
frothing
over
at
the
top
upon
the
were
flowering
plants
in
bright
red
pots
which
made
a
lively
show
against
the
white
front
of
the
house
and
in
the
darkness
of
the
doorway
there
were
streaks
of
light
which
glanced
off
from
the
surfaces
of
bottles
and
tankards
on
the
appeared
a
proper
figure
of
a
landlord
too
for
though
he
was
a
short
man
he
was
round
and
broad
and
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
legs
just
wide
enough
apart
to
express
a
mind
at
rest
upon
the
subject
of
the
cellar
and
an
easy
confidence
too
calm
and
virtuous
to
become
a
swagger
in
the
general
resources
of
the
inn
the
superabundant
moisture
trickling
from
everything
after
the
late
rain
set
him
off
well
nothing
near
him
was
thirsty
certain
dahlias
looking
over
the
palings
of
his
neat
garden
had
swilled
as
much
as
they
could
carry
perhaps
a
trifle
more
and
may
have
been
the
worse
for
liquor
but
the
roses
flowers
the
plants
at
the
windows
and
the
leaves
on
the
old
tree
were
in
the
beaming
state
of
moderate
company
that
had
taken
no
more
than
was
wholesome
for
them
and
had
served
to
develop
their
best
qualities
sprinkling
dewy
drops
about
them
on
the
ground
they
seemed
profuse
of
innocent
and
sparkling
mirth
that
did
good
where
it
lighted
softening
neglected
corners
which
the
steady
rain
could
seldom
reach
and
hurting
nothing
this
village
inn
had
assumed
on
being
established
an
uncommon
sign
it
was
called
the
and
underneath
that
household
word
was
inscribed
up
in
the
tree
on
the
same
flaming
board
and
in
the
like
golden
characters
by
benjamin
britain
at
a
second
glance
and
on
a
more
minute
examination
of
his
face
you
might
have
known
that
it
was
no
other
than
benjamin
britain
himself
who
stood
in
the
doorway
reasonably
changed
by
time
but
for
the
better
a
very
comfortable
host
indeed
said
britain
looking
down
the
road
rather
late
it
as
there
was
no
britain
coming
he
strolled
leisurely
out
into
the
road
and
looked
up
at
the
house
very
much
to
his
satisfaction
just
the
sort
of
house
said
benjamin
should
wish
to
stop
at
if
i
did
keep
it
then
he
strolled
towards
the
and
took
a
look
at
the
dahlias
they
looked
over
at
him
with
a
helpless
drowsy
hanging
of
their
heads
which
bobbed
again
as
the
heavy
drops
of
wet
dripped
off
them
must
be
looked
after
said
benjamin
not
to
forget
to
tell
her
so
she
a
long
time
coming
britain
better
half
seemed
to
be
by
so
very
much
his
better
half
that
his
own
moiety
of
himself
was
utterly
cast
away
and
helpless
without
her
had
much
to
do
i
think
said
ben
were
a
few
little
matters
of
business
after
market
but
not
many
oh
here
we
are
at
last
a
driven
by
a
boy
came
clattering
along
the
road
and
seated
in
it
in
a
chair
with
a
large
umbrella
spread
out
to
dry
behind
her
was
the
plump
figure
of
a
matronly
woman
with
her
bare
arms
folded
across
a
basket
which
she
carried
on
her
knee
several
other
baskets
and
parcels
lying
crowded
around
her
and
a
certain
bright
good
nature
in
her
face
and
contented
awkwardness
in
her
manner
as
she
jogged
to
and
fro
with
the
motion
of
her
carriage
which
smacked
of
old
times
even
in
the
distance
upon
her
nearer
approach
this
relish
of
days
was
not
diminished
and
when
the
cart
stopped
at
the
door
a
pair
of
shoes
alighting
from
it
slipped
nimbly
through
britain
open
arms
and
came
down
with
a
substantial
weight
upon
the
pathway
which
shoes
could
hardly
have
belonged
to
any
one
but
clemency
newcome
in
fact
they
did
belong
to
her
and
she
stood
in
them
and
a
rosy
soul
she
was
with
as
much
soap
on
her
glossy
face
as
in
times
of
yore
but
with
whole
elbows
now
that
had
grown
quite
dimpled
in
her
improved
condition
late
clemmy
said
britain

ben

replied
looking
busily
after
the
safe
removal
into
the
house
of
all
the
packages
and
baskets

britain
face
assumed
a
serious
expression
and
he
looked
hard
at
the
wall
it
kind
of
him
said
clemency

britain
the
sort
of
kindness
that
i
would

to

repeated
clemency
it
is
said
britain
it
was
only
this
very
day
that
i
heard
it
whispered
at
the
old
house
that
better
and
plainer
news
had
been
half
promised
of
her
soon
said
clemency
shaking
her
head
sorrowfully
and
patting
her
elbows
as
if
the
recollection
of
old
times
unconsciously
awakened
her
old
habits
dear
dear
there
be
heavy
hearts
ben
yonder
britain
heaved
a
sigh
and
shook
his
head
and
said
he
make
it
out
he
had
left
off
trying
long
ago
with
that
remark
he
applied
himself
to
putting
up
the
bill
just
inside
the
bar
window
clemency
after
meditating
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
roused
herself
cleared
her
thoughtful
brow
and
bustled
off
to
look
after
the
children
though
the
host
of
the
had
a
lively
regard
for
his
it
was
of
the
old
patronising
kind
and
she
amused
him
mightily
nothing
would
have
astonished
him
so
much
as
to
have
known
for
certain
from
any
third
party
that
it
was
she
who
managed
the
whole
house
and
made
him
by
her
plain
straightforward
thrift
honesty
and
industry
a
thriving
man
so
easy
it
is
in
any
degree
of
life
as
the
world
very
often
finds
it
to
take
those
cheerful
natures
that
never
assert
their
merit
at
their
own
modest
valuation
and
to
conceive
a
flippant
liking
of
people
for
their
outward
oddities
and
eccentricities
whose
innate
worth
if
we
would
look
so
far
might
make
us
blush
in
the
comparison
it
was
comfortable
to
britain
to
think
of
his
own
condescension
in
having
married
clemency
she
was
a
perpetual
testimony
to
him
of
the
goodness
of
his
heart
and
the
kindness
of
his
disposition
and
he
felt
that
her
being
an
excellent
wife
was
an
illustration
of
the
old
precept
that
virtue
is
its
own
reward
he
had
finished
wafering
up
the
bill
and
had
locked
the
vouchers
for
her
day
proceedings
in
the
cupboard
chuckling
all
the
time
over
her
capacity
for
business
when
returning
with
the
news
that
the
two
master
britains
were
playing
in
the
under
the
superintendence
of
one
betsey
and
that
little
clem
was
sleeping
a
picture
she
sat
down
to
tea
which
had
awaited
her
arrival
on
a
little
table
it
was
a
very
neat
little
bar
with
the
usual
display
of
bottles
and
glasses
a
sedate
clock
right
to
the
minute
it
was
five
everything
in
its
place
and
everything
furbished
and
polished
up
to
the
very
utmost
the
first
time
i
sat
down
quietly
i
declare
said
britain
taking
a
long
breath
as
if
she
had
sat
down
for
the
night
but
getting
up
again
immediately
to
hand
her
husband
his
tea
and
cut
him
his
that
bill
does
set
me
thinking
of
old
times
said
britain
handling
his
saucer
like
an
oyster
and
disposing
of
its
contents
on
the
same
principle
same
michael
warden
said
clemency
shaking
her
head
at
the
notice
of
sale
me
my
old
place
got
you
your
husband
said
britain
so
he
did
retorted
clemency
many
thanks
to
him
the
creature
of
habit
said
britain
surveying
her
over
his
saucer
had
somehow
got
used
to
you
clem
and
i
found
i
should
be
able
to
get
on
without
you
so
we
went
and
got
made
man
and
wife
ha
ha
we
who
have
thought
it
indeed
cried
clemency
was
very
good
of
you
ben
no
no
replied
britain
with
an
air
of
worth
mentioning
yes
it
was
ben
said
his
wife
with
great
simplicity
sure
i
think
so
and
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
ah
looking
again
at
the
bill
she
was
known
to
be
gone
and
out
of
reach
dear
girl
i
could
help
telling
for
her
sake
quite
as
much
as
theirs
what
i
knew
could
i
told
it
anyhow
observed
her
husband
jeddler
pursued
clemency
putting
down
her
and
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
bill
his
grief
and
passion
turned
me
out
of
house
and
home
i
never
have
been
so
glad
of
anything
in
all
my
life
as
that
i
did
say
an
angry
word
to
him
and
any
angry
feeling
towards
him
even
then
for
he
repented
that
truly
afterwards
how
often
he
has
sat
in
this
room
and
told
me
over
and
over
again
he
was
sorry
for
it
the
last
time
only
yesterday
when
you
were
out
how
often
he
has
sat
in
this
room
and
talked
to
me
hour
after
hour
about
one
thing
and
another
in
which
he
made
believe
to
be
interested
but
only
for
the
sake
of
the
days
that
are
gone
by
and
because
he
knows
she
used
to
like
me
ben
how
did
you
ever
come
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
that
clem
asked
her
husband
astonished
that
she
should
have
a
distinct
perception
of
a
truth
which
had
only
dimly
suggested
itself
to
his
inquiring
mind
do
know
i
sure
said
clemency
blowing
her
tea
to
cool
it
you
i
could
tell
you
if
you
was
to
offer
me
a
reward
of
a
hundred
pound
he
might
have
pursued
this
metaphysical
subject
but
for
her
catching
a
glimpse
of
a
substantial
fact
behind
him
in
the
shape
of
a
gentleman
attired
in
mourning
and
cloaked
and
booted
like
a
rider
on
horseback
who
stood
at
the
he
seemed
attentive
to
their
conversation
and
not
at
all
impatient
to
interrupt
it
clemency
hastily
rose
at
this
sight
britain
also
rose
and
saluted
the
guest
you
please
to
walk
sir
there
a
very
nice
room
sir
you
said
the
stranger
looking
earnestly
at
wife
i
come
in
here
surely
if
you
like
sir
returned
clemency
admitting
him
would
you
please
to
want
sir
the
bill
had
caught
his
eye
and
he
was
reading
it
property
that
sir
observed
britain
he
made
no
answer
but
turning
round
when
he
had
finished
reading
looked
at
clemency
with
the
same
observant
curiosity
as
before
were
asking
me
he
said
still
looking
at
her
you
would
please
to
take
sir
answered
clemency
stealing
a
glance
at
him
in
return
you
will
let
me
have
a
draught
of
ale
he
said
moving
to
a
table
by
the
window
will
let
me
have
it
here
without
being
any
interruption
to
your
meal
i
shall
be
much
obliged
to
you
he
sat
down
as
he
spoke
without
any
further
parley
and
looked
out
at
the
prospect
he
was
an
easy
figure
of
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
his
face
much
browned
by
the
sun
was
shaded
by
a
quantity
of
dark
hair
and
he
wore
a
moustache
his
beer
being
set
before
him
he
filled
out
a
glass
and
drank
to
the
house
adding
as
he
put
the
tumbler
down
again
a
new
house
is
it
not
particularly
new
sir
replied
britain
five
and
six
years
old
said
clemency
speaking
very
distinctly
think
i
heard
you
mention
jeddler
name
as
i
came
in
inquired
the
stranger
bill
reminds
me
of
him
for
i
happen
to
know
something
of
that
story
by
hearsay
and
through
certain
connexions
of
is
the
old
man
living
he
living
sir
said
clemency
changed
when
sir
returned
clemency
with
remarkable
emphasis
and
expression
his
daughter
went
away
he
greatly
changed
since
then
said
clemency
grey
and
old
and
has
the
same
way
with
him
at
all
but
i
think
happy
now
he
has
taken
on
with
his
sister
since
then
and
goes
to
see
her
very
often
that
did
him
good
directly
at
first
he
was
sadly
broken
down
and
it
was
enough
to
make
one
heart
bleed
to
see
him
wandering
about
railing
at
the
world
but
a
great
change
for
the
better
came
over
him
after
a
year
or
two
and
then
he
began
to
like
to
talk
about
his
lost
daughter
and
to
praise
her
ay
and
the
world
too
and
was
never
tired
of
saying
with
the
tears
in
his
poor
eyes
how
beautiful
and
good
she
was
he
had
forgiven
her
then
that
was
about
the
same
time
as
miss
grace
marriage
britain
you
remember
britain
remembered
very
well
sister
is
married
then
returned
the
stranger
he
paused
for
some
time
before
he
asked
whom
clemency
narrowly
escaped
oversetting
the
in
her
emotion
at
this
question
you
never
hear
she
said
should
like
to
hear
he
replied
as
he
filled
his
glass
again
and
raised
it
to
his
lips
it
would
be
a
long
story
if
it
was
properly
told
said
clemency
resting
her
chin
on
the
palm
of
her
left
hand
and
supporting
that
elbow
on
her
right
hand
as
she
shook
her
head
and
looked
back
through
the
intervening
years
as
if
she
were
looking
at
a
fire
would
be
a
long
story
i
am
sure
told
as
a
short
one
suggested
the
stranger
told
as
a
short
one
repeated
clemency
in
the
same
thoughtful
tone
and
without
any
apparent
reference
to
him
or
consciousness
of
having
auditors
would
there
be
to
tell
that
they
grieved
together
and
remembered
her
together
like
a
person
dead
that
they
were
so
tender
of
her
never
would
reproach
her
called
her
back
to
one
another
as
she
used
to
be
and
found
excuses
for
her
every
one
knows
that
i
sure
i
do
no
one
better
added
clemency
wiping
her
eyes
with
her
hand
so
suggested
the
stranger
so
said
clemency
taking
him
up
mechanically
and
without
any
change
in
her
attitude
or
manner
at
last
were
married
they
were
married
on
her
it
comes
round
again
very
quiet
very
humble
like
but
very
happy
alfred
said
one
night
when
they
were
walking
in
the
orchard
grace
shall
our
be
marion
and
it
was
they
have
lived
happily
together
said
the
stranger
said
clemency
two
people
ever
more
so
they
have
had
no
sorrow
but
this
she
raised
her
head
as
with
a
sudden
attention
to
the
circumstances
under
which
she
was
recalling
these
events
and
looked
quickly
at
the
stranger
seeing
that
his
face
was
turned
toward
the
window
and
that
he
seemed
intent
upon
the
prospect
she
made
some
eager
signs
to
her
husband
and
pointed
to
the
bill
and
moved
her
mouth
as
if
she
were
repeating
with
great
energy
one
word
or
phrase
to
him
over
and
over
again
as
she
uttered
no
sound
and
as
her
dumb
motions
like
most
of
her
gestures
were
of
a
very
extraordinary
kind
this
unintelligible
conduct
reduced
britain
to
the
confines
of
despair
he
stared
at
the
table
at
the
stranger
at
the
spoons
at
his
wife
followed
her
pantomime
with
looks
of
deep
amazement
and
perplexity
asked
in
the
same
language
was
it
property
in
danger
was
it
he
in
danger
was
it
she
answered
her
signals
with
other
signals
expressive
of
the
deepest
distress
and
confusion
followed
the
motions
of
her
lips
guessed
half
aloud
and
water
warning
and
walnuts
and
could
approach
her
meaning
clemency
gave
it
up
at
last
as
a
hopeless
attempt
and
moving
her
chair
by
very
slow
degrees
a
little
nearer
to
the
stranger
sat
with
her
eyes
apparently
cast
down
but
glancing
sharply
at
him
now
and
then
waiting
until
he
should
ask
some
other
question
she
had
not
to
wait
long
for
he
said
presently
what
is
the
after
history
of
the
young
lady
who
went
away
they
know
it
i
suppose
clemency
shook
her
head
heard
she
said
doctor
jeddler
is
thought
to
know
more
of
it
than
he
tells
miss
grace
has
had
letters
from
her
sister
saying
that
she
was
well
and
happy
and
made
much
happier
by
her
being
married
to
alfred
and
has
written
letters
back
but
there
a
mystery
about
her
life
and
fortunes
altogether
which
nothing
has
cleared
up
to
this
hour
and
which
she
faltered
here
and
stopped
which
repeated
the
stranger
only
one
other
person
i
believe
could
explain
said
clemency
drawing
her
breath
quickly
may
that
be
asked
the
stranger
michael
warden
answered
clemency
almost
in
a
shriek
at
once
conveying
to
her
husband
what
she
would
have
had
him
understand
before
and
letting
michael
warden
know
that
he
was
recognised
remember
me
sir
said
clemency
trembling
with
emotion
saw
just
now
you
did
you
remember
me
that
night
in
the
garden
i
was
with
her
you
were
he
said
sir
returned
clemency
to
be
sure
this
is
my
husband
if
you
please
ben
my
dear
ben
run
to
miss
grace
run
to
alfred
run
somewhere
ben
bring
somebody
here
directly
said
michael
warden
quietly
interposing
himself
between
the
door
and
britain
would
you
do
them
know
that
you
are
here
sir
answered
clemency
clapping
her
hands
in
sheer
agitation
them
know
that
they
may
hear
of
her
from
your
own
lips
let
them
know
that
she
is
not
quite
lost
to
them
but
that
she
will
come
home
again
yet
to
bless
her
father
and
her
loving
sister
even
her
old
servant
even
me
she
struck
herself
upon
the
breast
with
both
hands
a
sight
of
her
sweet
face
run
ben
run
and
still
she
pressed
him
on
towards
the
door
and
still
mr
warden
stood
before
it
with
his
hand
stretched
out
not
angrily
but
sorrowfully
perhaps
said
clemency
running
past
her
husband
and
catching
in
her
emotion
at
mr
warden
cloak
she
here
now
perhaps
she
close
by
i
think
from
your
manner
she
is
let
me
see
her
sir
if
you
please
i
waited
on
her
when
she
was
a
little
child
i
saw
her
grow
to
be
the
pride
of
all
this
place
i
knew
her
when
she
was
alfred
promised
wife
i
tried
to
warn
her
when
you
tempted
her
away
i
know
what
her
old
home
was
when
she
was
like
the
soul
of
it
and
how
it
changed
when
she
was
gone
and
lost
let
me
speak
to
her
if
you
please
he
gazed
at
her
with
compassion
not
unmixed
with
wonder
but
he
made
no
gesture
of
assent
do
think
she
can
know
pursued
clemency
truly
they
forgive
her
how
they
love
her
what
joy
it
would
be
to
them
to
see
her
once
more
she
may
be
timorous
of
going
home
perhaps
if
she
sees
me
it
may
give
her
new
heart
only
tell
me
truly
mr
warden
is
she
with
you
is
not
he
answered
shaking
his
head
this
answer
and
his
manner
and
his
black
dress
and
his
coming
back
so
quietly
and
his
announced
intention
of
continuing
to
live
abroad
explained
it
all
marion
was
dead
he
did
contradict
her
yes
she
was
dead
clemency
sat
down
hid
her
face
upon
the
table
and
cried
at
that
moment
a
old
gentleman
came
running
in
quite
out
of
breath
and
panting
so
much
that
his
voice
was
scarcely
to
be
recognised
as
the
voice
of
snitchey
heaven
mr
warden
said
the
lawyer
taking
him
aside
wind
has
blown
he
was
so
blown
himself
that
he
could
get
on
any
further
until
after
a
pause
when
he
added
feebly
here
i
am
afraid
he
answered
you
could
have
heard
what
has
just
passed
how
i
have
been
besought
and
entreated
to
perform
impossibilities
what
confusion
and
affliction
i
carry
with
me
can
guess
it
all
but
why
did
you
ever
come
here
my
good
sir
retorted
snitchey
how
should
i
know
who
kept
the
house
when
i
sent
my
servant
on
to
you
i
strolled
in
here
because
the
place
was
new
to
me
and
i
had
a
natural
curiosity
in
everything
new
and
old
in
these
old
scenes
and
it
was
outside
the
town
i
wanted
to
communicate
with
you
first
before
appearing
there
i
wanted
to
know
what
people
would
say
to
me
i
see
by
your
manner
that
you
can
tell
me
if
it
were
not
for
your
confounded
caution
i
should
have
been
possessed
of
everything
long
ago
caution
returned
the
lawyer
for
self
and
craggs
deceased
here
snitchey
glancing
at
his
shook
his
head
can
you
reasonably
blame
us
mr
warden
it
was
understood
between
us
that
the
subject
was
never
to
be
renewed
and
that
it
was
a
subject
on
which
grave
and
sober
men
like
us
i
made
a
note
of
your
observations
at
the
time
could
interfere
our
caution
too
when
craggs
sir
went
down
to
his
respected
grave
in
the
full
belief
had
given
a
solemn
promise
of
silence
until
i
should
return
whenever
that
might
be
interrupted
mr
warden
i
have
kept
it
sir
and
i
repeat
it
returned
snitchey
were
bound
to
silence
too
we
were
bound
to
silence
in
our
duty
towards
ourselves
and
in
our
duty
towards
a
variety
of
clients
you
among
them
who
were
as
close
as
wax
it
was
not
our
place
to
make
inquiries
of
you
on
such
a
delicate
subject
i
had
my
suspicions
sir
but
it
is
not
six
months
since
i
have
known
the
truth
and
been
assured
that
you
lost
her
whom
inquired
his
client
doctor
jeddler
himself
sir
who
at
last
reposed
that
confidence
in
me
voluntarily
he
and
only
he
has
known
the
whole
truth
years
and
years
you
know
it
said
his
client
do
sir
replied
snitchey
i
have
also
reason
to
know
that
it
will
be
broken
to
her
sister
evening
they
have
given
her
that
promise
in
the
meantime
perhaps
you
give
me
the
honour
of
your
company
at
my
house
being
unexpected
at
your
own
but
not
to
run
the
chance
of
any
more
such
difficulties
as
you
have
had
here
in
case
you
should
be
recognised
though
you
a
good
deal
changed
i
think
i
might
have
passed
you
myself
mr
warden
we
had
better
dine
here
and
walk
on
in
the
evening
a
very
good
place
to
dine
at
mr
warden
your
own
property
self
and
craggs
deceased
took
a
chop
here
sometimes
and
had
it
very
comfortably
served
craggs
sir
said
snitchey
shutting
his
eyes
tight
for
an
instant
and
opening
them
again
struck
off
the
roll
of
life
too
soon
forgive
me
for
not
condoling
with
you
returned
michael
warden
passing
his
hand
across
his
forehead
i
like
a
man
in
a
dream
at
present
i
seem
to
want
my
wits
craggs
yes
i
am
very
sorry
we
have
lost
mr
craggs
but
he
looked
at
clemency
as
he
said
it
and
seemed
to
sympathise
with
ben
consoling
her
craggs
sir
observed
snitchey
find
life
i
regret
to
say
as
easy
to
have
and
to
hold
as
his
theory
made
it
out
or
he
would
have
been
among
us
now
it
a
great
loss
to
me
he
was
my
right
arm
my
right
leg
my
right
ear
my
right
eye
was
craggs
i
am
paralytic
without
him
he
bequeathed
his
share
of
the
business
to
craggs
her
executors
administrators
and
assigns
his
name
remains
in
the
firm
to
this
hour
i
try
in
a
childish
sort
of
a
way
to
make
believe
sometimes
he
alive
you
may
observe
that
i
speak
for
self
and
craggs
deceased
sir
deceased
said
the
attorney
waving
his
handkerchief
michael
warden
who
had
still
been
observant
of
clemency
turned
to
snitchey
when
he
ceased
to
speak
and
whispered
in
his
ear
poor
thing
said
snitchey
shaking
his
head
she
was
always
very
faithful
to
marion
she
was
always
very
fond
of
her
pretty
marion
poor
marion
cheer
up
mistress
you
are
married
now
you
know
clemency
clemency
only
sighed
and
shook
her
head
well
wait
till
said
the
lawyer
kindly
ca
bring
back
the
dead
to
life
mister
said
clemency
sobbing
it
ca
do
that
or
it
would
bring
back
craggs
deceased
returned
the
lawyer
it
may
bring
some
soothing
circumstances
it
may
bring
some
comfort
wait
till
so
clemency
shaking
his
proffered
hand
said
she
would
and
britain
who
had
been
terribly
cast
down
at
sight
of
his
despondent
wife
which
was
like
the
business
hanging
its
head
said
that
was
right
and
snitchey
and
michael
warden
went
and
there
they
were
soon
engaged
in
a
conversation
so
cautiously
conducted
that
no
murmur
of
it
was
audible
above
the
clatter
of
plates
and
dishes
the
hissing
of
the
the
bubbling
of
saucepans
the
low
monotonous
waltzing
of
the
jack
with
a
dreadful
click
every
now
and
then
as
if
it
had
met
with
some
mortal
accident
to
its
head
in
a
fit
of
giddiness
and
all
the
other
preparations
in
the
kitchen
for
their
dinner
was
a
bright
and
peaceful
day
and
nowhere
were
the
autumn
tints
more
beautifully
seen
than
from
the
quiet
orchard
of
the
doctor
house
the
snows
of
many
winter
nights
had
melted
from
that
ground
the
withered
leaves
of
many
summer
times
had
rustled
there
since
she
had
fled
the
porch
was
green
again
the
trees
cast
bountiful
and
changing
shadows
on
the
grass
the
landscape
was
as
tranquil
and
serene
as
it
had
ever
been
but
where
was
she
not
there
not
there
she
would
have
been
a
stranger
sight
in
her
old
home
now
even
than
that
home
had
been
at
first
without
her
but
a
lady
sat
in
the
familiar
place
from
whose
heart
she
had
never
passed
away
in
whose
true
memory
she
lived
unchanging
youthful
radiant
with
all
promise
and
all
hope
in
whose
affection
and
it
was
a
mother
now
there
was
a
cherished
little
daughter
playing
by
her
side
she
had
no
rival
no
successor
upon
whose
gentle
lips
her
name
was
trembling
then
the
spirit
of
the
lost
girl
looked
out
of
those
eyes
those
eyes
of
grace
her
sister
sitting
with
her
husband
in
the
orchard
on
their
and
his
and
marion
he
had
not
become
a
great
man
he
had
not
grown
rich
he
had
not
forgotten
the
scenes
and
friends
of
his
youth
he
had
not
fulfilled
any
one
of
the
doctor
old
predictions
but
in
his
useful
patient
unknown
visiting
of
poor
men
homes
and
in
his
watching
of
sick
beds
and
in
his
daily
knowledge
of
the
gentleness
and
goodness
flowering
the
of
this
world
not
to
be
trodden
down
beneath
the
heavy
foot
of
poverty
but
springing
up
elastic
in
its
track
and
making
its
way
beautiful
he
had
better
learned
and
proved
in
each
succeeding
year
the
truth
of
his
old
faith
the
manner
of
his
life
though
quiet
and
remote
had
shown
him
how
often
men
still
entertained
angels
unawares
as
in
the
olden
time
and
how
the
most
unlikely
forms
even
some
that
were
mean
and
ugly
to
the
view
and
poorly
clad
became
irradiated
by
the
couch
of
sorrow
want
and
pain
and
changed
to
ministering
spirits
with
a
glory
round
their
heads
he
lived
to
better
purpose
on
the
altered
perhaps
than
if
he
had
contended
restlessly
in
more
ambitious
lists
and
he
was
happy
with
his
wife
dear
grace
and
marion
had
he
forgotten
her
time
has
flown
dear
grace
he
said
then
they
had
been
talking
of
that
night
yet
it
seems
a
long
long
while
ago
we
count
by
changes
and
events
within
us
not
by
years
we
have
years
to
count
by
too
since
marion
was
with
us
returned
grace
times
dear
husband
counting
as
one
we
have
sat
here
on
her
and
spoken
together
of
that
happy
return
so
eagerly
expected
and
so
long
deferred
ah
when
will
it
be
when
will
it
be
her
husband
attentively
observed
her
as
the
tears
collected
in
her
eyes
and
drawing
nearer
said
marion
told
you
in
that
farewell
letter
which
she
left
for
you
upon
your
table
love
and
which
you
read
so
often
that
years
must
pass
away
before
it
could
be
did
she
not
she
took
a
letter
from
her
breast
and
kissed
it
and
said
through
these
intervening
years
however
happy
she
might
be
she
would
look
forward
to
the
time
when
you
would
meet
again
and
all
would
be
made
clear
and
that
she
prayed
you
trustfully
and
hopefully
to
do
the
same
the
letter
runs
so
does
it
not
my
dear
alfred
every
other
letter
she
has
written
since
the
last
some
months
ago
in
which
she
spoke
of
you
and
what
you
then
knew
and
what
i
was
to
learn
he
looked
towards
the
sun
then
fast
declining
and
said
that
the
appointed
time
was
sunset
said
grace
laying
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
earnestly
is
something
in
this
letter
this
old
letter
which
you
say
i
read
so
often
that
i
have
never
told
you
but
dear
husband
with
that
sunset
drawing
near
and
all
our
life
seeming
to
soften
and
become
hushed
with
the
departing
day
i
can
not
keep
it
secret
is
it
love
marion
went
away
she
wrote
me
here
that
you
had
once
left
her
a
sacred
trust
to
me
and
that
now
she
left
you
alfred
such
a
trust
in
my
hands
praying
and
beseeching
me
as
i
loved
her
and
as
i
loved
you
not
to
reject
the
affection
she
believed
she
knew
she
said
you
would
transfer
to
me
when
the
new
wound
was
healed
but
to
encourage
and
return
it
and
make
me
a
proud
and
happy
man
again
grace
did
she
say
so
meant
to
make
myself
so
blest
and
honoured
in
your
love
was
his
wife
answer
as
he
held
her
in
his
arms
me
my
dear
he
hear
me
so
and
as
he
spoke
he
gently
laid
the
head
she
had
raised
again
upon
his
shoulder
know
why
i
have
never
heard
this
passage
in
the
letter
until
now
i
know
why
no
trace
of
it
ever
showed
itself
in
any
word
or
look
of
yours
at
that
time
i
know
why
grace
although
so
true
a
friend
to
me
was
hard
to
win
to
be
my
wife
and
knowing
it
my
own
i
know
the
priceless
value
of
the
heart
i
gird
within
my
arms
and
thank
god
for
the
rich
possession
she
wept
but
not
for
sorrow
as
he
pressed
her
to
his
heart
after
a
brief
space
he
looked
down
at
the
child
who
was
sitting
at
their
feet
playing
with
a
little
basket
of
flowers
and
bade
her
look
how
golden
and
how
red
the
sun
was
said
grace
raising
her
head
quickly
at
these
words
sun
is
going
down
you
have
not
forgotten
what
i
am
to
know
before
it
sets
are
to
know
the
truth
of
marion
history
my
love
he
answered
the
truth
she
said
imploringly
veiled
from
me
any
more
that
was
the
promise
was
it
not
was
he
answered
the
sun
went
down
on
marion
and
you
see
it
alfred
it
is
sinking
fast
he
put
his
arm
about
her
waist
and
looking
steadily
into
her
eyes
rejoined
truth
is
not
reserved
so
long
for
me
to
tell
dear
grace
it
is
to
come
from
other
lips
other
lips
she
faintly
echoed
i
know
your
constant
heart
i
know
how
brave
you
are
i
know
that
to
you
a
word
of
preparation
is
enough
you
have
said
truly
that
the
time
is
come
it
is
tell
me
that
you
have
present
fortitude
to
bear
a
trial
a
surprise
a
shock
and
the
messenger
is
waiting
at
the
gate
messenger
she
said
what
intelligence
does
he
bring
am
pledged
he
answered
her
preserving
his
steady
look
say
no
more
do
you
think
you
understand
me
am
afraid
to
think
she
said
there
was
that
emotion
in
his
face
despite
its
steady
gaze
which
frightened
her
again
she
hid
her
own
face
on
his
shoulder
trembling
and
entreated
him
to
pause
a
moment
my
wife
when
you
have
firmness
to
receive
the
messenger
the
messenger
is
waiting
at
the
gate
the
sun
is
setting
on
marion
courage
courage
grace
she
raised
her
head
and
looking
at
him
told
him
she
was
ready
as
she
stood
and
looked
upon
him
going
away
her
face
was
so
like
marion
as
it
had
been
in
her
later
days
at
home
that
it
was
wonderful
to
see
he
took
the
child
with
him
she
called
her
back
she
bore
the
lost
girl
name
and
pressed
her
to
her
bosom
the
little
creature
being
released
again
sped
after
him
and
grace
was
left
alone
she
knew
not
what
she
dreaded
or
what
hoped
but
remained
there
motionless
looking
at
the
porch
by
which
they
had
disappeared
ah
what
was
that
emerging
from
its
shadow
standing
on
its
threshold
that
figure
with
its
white
garments
rustling
in
the
evening
air
its
head
laid
down
upon
her
father
breast
and
pressed
against
it
to
his
loving
heart
o
god
was
it
a
vision
that
came
bursting
from
the
old
man
arms
and
with
a
cry
and
with
a
waving
of
its
hands
and
with
a
wild
precipitation
of
itself
upon
her
in
its
boundless
love
sank
down
in
her
embrace
marion
marion
oh
my
sister
oh
my
heart
dear
love
oh
joy
and
happiness
unutterable
so
to
meet
again
it
was
no
dream
no
phantom
conjured
up
by
hope
and
fear
but
marion
sweet
marion
so
beautiful
so
happy
so
unalloyed
by
care
and
trial
so
elevated
and
exalted
in
her
loveliness
that
as
the
setting
sun
shone
brightly
on
her
upturned
face
she
might
have
been
a
spirit
visiting
the
earth
upon
some
healing
mission
clinging
to
her
sister
who
had
dropped
upon
a
seat
and
bent
down
over
her
and
smiling
through
her
tears
and
kneeling
close
before
her
with
both
arms
twining
round
her
and
never
turning
for
an
instant
from
her
face
and
with
the
glory
of
the
setting
sun
upon
her
brow
and
with
the
soft
tranquillity
of
evening
gathering
around
them
marion
at
length
broke
silence
her
voice
so
calm
low
clear
and
pleasant
to
the
time
this
was
my
dear
home
grace
as
it
will
be
now
again
my
sweet
love
a
moment
o
marion
to
hear
you
speak
again
she
could
not
bear
the
voice
she
loved
so
well
at
first
this
was
my
dear
home
grace
as
it
will
be
now
again
i
loved
him
from
my
soul
i
loved
him
most
devotedly
i
would
have
died
for
him
though
i
was
so
young
i
never
slighted
his
affection
in
my
secret
breast
for
one
brief
instant
it
was
far
beyond
all
price
to
me
although
it
is
so
long
ago
and
past
and
gone
and
everything
is
wholly
changed
i
could
not
bear
to
think
that
you
who
love
so
well
should
think
i
did
not
truly
love
him
once
i
never
loved
him
better
grace
than
when
he
left
this
very
scene
upon
this
very
day
i
never
loved
him
better
dear
one
than
i
did
that
night
when
i
left
here
her
sister
bending
over
her
could
look
into
her
face
and
hold
her
fast
he
had
gained
unconsciously
said
marion
with
a
gentle
smile
heart
before
i
knew
that
i
had
one
to
give
him
that
heart
yours
my
sister
was
so
yielded
up
in
all
its
other
tenderness
to
me
was
so
devoted
and
so
noble
that
it
plucked
its
love
away
and
kept
its
secret
from
all
eyes
but
mine
ah
what
other
eyes
were
quickened
by
such
tenderness
and
gratitude
and
was
content
to
sacrifice
itself
to
me
but
i
knew
something
of
its
depths
i
knew
the
struggle
it
had
made
i
knew
its
high
inestimable
worth
to
him
and
his
appreciation
of
it
let
him
love
me
as
he
would
i
knew
the
debt
i
owed
it
i
had
its
great
example
every
day
before
me
what
you
had
done
for
me
i
knew
that
i
could
do
grace
if
i
would
for
you
i
never
laid
my
head
down
on
my
pillow
but
i
prayed
with
tears
to
do
it
i
never
laid
my
head
down
on
my
pillow
but
i
thought
of
alfred
own
words
on
the
day
of
his
departure
and
how
truly
he
had
said
for
i
knew
that
knowing
you
that
there
were
victories
gained
every
day
in
struggling
hearts
to
which
these
fields
of
battle
were
nothing
thinking
more
and
more
upon
the
great
endurance
cheerfully
sustained
and
never
known
or
cared
for
that
there
must
be
every
day
and
hour
in
that
great
strife
of
which
he
spoke
my
trial
seemed
to
grow
light
and
easy
and
he
who
knows
our
hearts
my
dearest
at
this
moment
and
who
knows
there
is
no
drop
of
bitterness
or
grief
of
anything
but
unmixed
happiness
in
mine
enabled
me
to
make
the
resolution
that
i
never
would
be
wife
that
he
should
be
my
brother
and
your
husband
if
the
course
i
took
could
bring
that
happy
end
to
pass
but
that
i
never
would
grace
i
then
loved
him
dearly
dearly
be
his
wife
marion
o
marion
had
tried
to
seem
indifferent
to
him
and
she
pressed
her
sister
face
against
her
own
that
was
hard
and
you
were
always
his
true
advocate
i
had
tried
to
tell
you
of
my
resolution
but
you
would
never
hear
me
you
would
never
understand
me
the
time
was
drawing
near
for
his
return
i
felt
that
i
must
act
before
the
daily
intercourse
between
us
was
renewed
i
knew
that
one
great
pang
undergone
at
that
time
would
save
a
lengthened
agony
to
all
of
us
i
knew
that
if
i
went
away
then
that
end
must
follow
which
has
followed
and
which
has
made
us
both
so
happy
grace
i
wrote
to
good
aunt
martha
for
a
refuge
in
her
house
i
did
not
then
tell
her
all
but
something
of
my
story
and
she
freely
promised
it
while
i
was
contesting
that
step
with
myself
and
with
my
love
of
you
and
home
mr
warden
brought
here
by
an
accident
became
for
some
time
our
companion
have
sometimes
feared
of
late
years
that
this
might
have
been
exclaimed
her
sister
and
her
countenance
was
never
loved
him
and
you
married
him
in
your
to
me
was
then
said
marion
drawing
her
sister
closer
to
her
the
eve
of
going
secretly
away
for
a
long
time
he
wrote
to
me
after
leaving
here
told
me
what
his
condition
and
prospects
really
were
and
offered
me
his
hand
he
told
me
he
had
seen
i
was
not
happy
in
the
prospect
of
alfred
return
i
believe
he
thought
my
heart
had
no
part
in
that
contract
perhaps
thought
i
might
have
loved
him
once
and
did
not
then
perhaps
thought
that
when
i
tried
to
seem
indifferent
i
tried
to
hide
indifference
i
can
not
tell
but
i
wished
that
you
should
feel
me
wholly
lost
to
alfred
hopeless
to
him
dead
do
you
understand
me
love
her
sister
looked
into
her
face
attentively
she
seemed
in
doubt
saw
mr
warden
and
confided
in
his
honour
charged
him
with
my
secret
on
the
eve
of
his
and
my
departure
he
kept
it
do
you
understand
me
dear
grace
looked
confusedly
upon
her
she
scarcely
seemed
to
hear
love
my
sister
said
marion
your
thoughts
a
moment
listen
to
me
do
not
look
so
strangely
on
me
there
are
countries
dearest
where
those
who
would
abjure
a
misplaced
passion
or
would
strive
against
some
cherished
feeling
of
their
hearts
and
conquer
it
retire
into
a
hopeless
solitude
and
close
the
world
against
themselves
and
worldly
loves
and
hopes
for
ever
when
women
do
so
they
assume
that
name
which
is
so
dear
to
you
and
me
and
call
each
other
sisters
but
there
may
be
sisters
grace
who
in
the
broad
world
out
of
doors
and
underneath
its
free
sky
and
in
its
crowded
places
and
among
its
busy
life
and
trying
to
assist
and
cheer
it
and
to
do
some
good
learn
the
same
lesson
and
who
with
hearts
still
fresh
and
young
and
open
to
all
happiness
and
means
of
happiness
can
say
the
battle
is
long
past
the
victory
long
won
and
such
a
one
am
i
you
understand
me
now
still
she
looked
fixedly
upon
her
and
made
no
reply
grace
dear
grace
said
marion
clinging
yet
more
tenderly
and
fondly
to
that
breast
from
which
she
had
been
so
long
exiled
you
were
not
a
happy
wife
and
mother
if
i
had
no
little
namesake
here
if
alfred
my
kind
brother
were
not
your
own
fond
husband
from
whence
could
i
derive
the
ecstasy
i
feel
but
as
i
left
here
so
i
have
returned
my
heart
has
known
no
other
love
my
hand
has
never
been
bestowed
apart
from
it
i
am
still
your
maiden
sister
unmarried
unbetrothed
your
own
loving
old
marion
in
whose
affection
you
exist
alone
and
have
no
partner
grace
she
understood
her
now
her
face
relaxed
sobs
came
to
her
relief
and
falling
on
her
neck
she
wept
and
wept
and
fondled
her
as
if
she
were
a
child
again
when
they
were
more
composed
they
found
that
the
doctor
and
his
sister
good
aunt
martha
were
standing
near
at
hand
with
alfred
is
a
weary
day
for
me
said
good
aunt
martha
smiling
through
her
tears
as
she
embraced
her
nieces
i
lose
my
dear
companion
in
making
you
all
happy
and
what
can
you
give
me
in
return
for
my
marion
converted
brother
said
the
doctor
something
to
be
sure
retorted
aunt
martha
such
a
farce
as
pray
do
said
the
doctor
penitently
i
wo
replied
aunt
martha
i
consider
myself
ill
used
i
do
know
what
to
become
of
me
without
my
marion
after
we
have
lived
together
years
must
come
and
live
here
i
suppose
replied
the
doctor
sha
quarrel
now
martha
you
must
get
married
aunt
said
alfred
returned
the
old
lady
think
it
might
be
a
good
speculation
if
i
were
to
set
my
cap
at
michael
warden
who
i
hear
is
come
home
much
the
better
for
his
absence
in
all
respects
but
as
i
knew
him
when
he
was
a
boy
and
i
was
not
a
very
young
woman
then
perhaps
he
might
respond
so
i
make
up
my
mind
to
go
and
live
with
marion
when
she
marries
and
until
then
it
will
not
be
very
long
i
dare
say
to
live
alone
what
do
you
say
brother
a
great
mind
to
say
it
a
ridiculous
world
altogether
and
there
nothing
serious
in
it
observed
the
poor
old
doctor
might
take
twenty
affidavits
of
it
if
you
chose
anthony
said
his
sister
nobody
would
believe
you
with
such
eyes
as
those
a
world
full
of
hearts
said
the
doctor
hugging
his
younger
daughter
and
bending
across
her
to
hug
grace
for
he
could
separate
the
sisters
a
serious
world
with
all
its
folly
even
with
mine
which
was
enough
to
have
swamped
the
whole
globe
and
it
is
a
world
on
which
the
sun
never
rises
but
it
looks
upon
a
thousand
bloodless
battles
that
are
some
against
the
miseries
and
wickedness
of
and
it
is
a
world
we
need
be
careful
how
we
libel
heaven
forgive
us
for
it
is
a
world
of
sacred
mysteries
and
its
creator
only
knows
what
lies
beneath
the
surface
of
his
lightest
image
you
would
not
be
the
better
pleased
with
my
rude
pen
if
it
dissected
and
laid
open
to
your
view
the
transports
of
this
family
long
severed
and
now
reunited
therefore
i
will
not
follow
the
poor
doctor
through
his
humbled
recollection
of
the
sorrow
he
had
had
when
marion
was
lost
to
him
nor
will
i
tell
how
serious
he
had
found
that
world
to
be
in
which
some
love
is
the
portion
of
all
human
creatures
nor
how
such
a
trifle
as
the
absence
of
one
little
unit
in
the
great
absurd
account
had
stricken
him
to
the
ground
nor
how
in
compassion
for
his
distress
his
sister
had
long
ago
revealed
the
truth
to
him
by
slow
degrees
and
brought
him
to
the
knowledge
of
the
heart
of
his
daughter
and
to
that
daughter
side
nor
how
alfred
heathfield
had
been
told
the
truth
too
in
the
course
of
that
then
current
year
and
marion
had
seen
him
and
had
promised
him
as
her
brother
that
on
her
in
the
evening
grace
should
know
it
from
her
lips
at
last
beg
your
pardon
doctor
said
snitchey
looking
into
the
orchard
have
i
liberty
to
come
in
without
waiting
for
permission
he
came
straight
to
marion
and
kissed
her
hand
quite
joyfully
craggs
had
been
alive
my
dear
miss
marion
said
snitchey
would
have
had
great
interest
in
this
occasion
it
might
have
suggested
to
him
alfred
that
our
life
is
not
too
easy
perhaps
that
taken
altogether
it
will
bear
any
little
smoothing
we
can
give
it
but
craggs
was
a
man
who
could
endure
to
be
convinced
sir
he
was
always
open
to
conviction
if
he
were
open
to
conviction
now
i
this
is
weakness
snitchey
my
dear
at
his
summons
that
lady
appeared
from
behind
the
door
are
among
old
friends
snitchey
having
delivered
her
congratulations
took
her
husband
aside
moment
snitchey
said
that
lady
is
not
in
my
nature
to
rake
up
the
ashes
of
the
departed
my
dear
returned
her
husband
craggs
is
my
dear
he
is
deceased
said
snitchey
i
ask
you
if
you
recollect
pursued
his
wife
evening
of
the
ball
i
only
ask
you
that
if
you
do
and
if
your
memory
has
not
entirely
failed
you
snitchey
and
if
you
are
not
absolutely
in
your
dotage
i
ask
you
to
connect
this
time
with
that
to
remember
how
i
begged
and
prayed
you
on
my
knees
your
knees
my
dear
said
snitchey
said
snitchey
confidently
you
know
it
to
beware
of
that
man
to
observe
his
eye
and
now
to
tell
me
whether
i
was
right
and
whether
at
that
moment
he
knew
secrets
which
he
did
choose
to
tell
snitchey
returned
her
husband
in
her
ear
did
you
ever
observe
anything
in
my
eye
said
snitchey
sharply
flatter
yourself
madam
that
night
he
continued
twitching
her
by
the
sleeve
happens
that
we
both
knew
secrets
which
we
choose
to
tell
and
both
knew
just
the
same
professionally
and
so
the
less
you
say
about
such
things
the
better
snitchey
and
take
this
as
a
warning
to
have
wiser
and
more
charitable
eyes
another
time
miss
marion
i
brought
a
friend
of
yours
along
with
me
here
mistress
poor
clemency
with
her
apron
to
her
eyes
came
slowly
in
escorted
by
her
husband
the
latter
doleful
with
the
presentiment
that
if
she
abandoned
herself
to
grief
the
was
done
for
mistress
said
the
lawyer
checking
marion
as
she
ran
towards
her
and
interposing
himself
between
them
the
matter
with
you
matter
cried
poor
when
looking
up
in
wonder
and
in
indignant
remonstrance
and
in
the
added
emotion
of
a
great
roar
from
britain
and
seeing
that
sweet
face
so
well
remembered
close
before
her
she
stared
sobbed
laughed
cried
screamed
embraced
her
held
her
fast
released
her
fell
on
snitchey
and
embraced
him
much
to
snitchey
indignation
fell
on
the
doctor
and
embraced
him
fell
on
britain
and
embraced
him
and
concluded
by
embracing
herself
throwing
her
apron
over
her
head
and
going
into
hysterics
behind
it
a
stranger
had
come
into
the
orchard
after
snitchey
and
had
remained
apart
near
the
gate
without
being
observed
by
any
of
the
group
for
they
had
little
spare
attention
to
bestow
and
that
had
been
monopolised
by
the
ecstasies
of
clemency
he
did
not
appear
to
wish
to
be
observed
but
stood
alone
with
downcast
eyes
and
there
was
an
air
of
dejection
about
him
though
he
was
a
gentleman
of
a
gallant
appearance
which
the
general
happiness
rendered
more
remarkable
none
but
the
quick
eyes
of
aunt
martha
however
remarked
him
at
all
but
almost
as
soon
as
she
espied
him
she
was
in
conversation
with
him
presently
going
to
where
marion
stood
with
grace
and
her
little
namesake
she
whispered
something
in
marion
ear
at
which
she
started
and
appeared
surprised
but
soon
recovering
from
her
confusion
she
timidly
approached
the
stranger
in
aunt
martha
company
and
engaged
in
conversation
with
him
too
britain
said
the
lawyer
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
bringing
out
a
document
while
this
was
going
on
congratulate
you
you
are
now
the
whole
and
sole
proprietor
of
that
freehold
tenement
at
present
occupied
and
held
by
yourself
as
a
licensed
tavern
or
house
of
public
entertainment
and
commonly
called
or
known
by
the
sign
of
the
your
wife
lost
one
house
through
my
client
michael
warden
and
now
gains
another
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
canvassing
you
for
the
county
one
of
these
fine
mornings
it
make
any
difference
in
the
vote
if
the
sign
was
altered
sir
asked
britain
in
the
least
replied
the
lawyer
said
britain
handing
him
back
the
conveyance
clap
in
the
words
and
thimble
will
you
be
so
good
and
have
the
two
mottoes
painted
up
in
the
parlour
instead
of
my
portrait
let
me
said
a
voice
behind
them
it
was
the
stranger
michael
warden
me
claim
the
benefit
of
those
inscriptions
heathfield
and
jeddler
i
might
have
deeply
wronged
you
both
that
i
did
not
is
no
virtue
of
my
own
i
will
not
say
that
i
am
six
years
wiser
than
i
was
or
better
but
i
have
known
at
any
rate
that
term
of
i
can
urge
no
reason
why
you
should
deal
gently
with
me
i
abused
the
hospitality
of
this
house
and
learnt
by
my
own
demerits
with
a
shame
i
never
have
forgotten
yet
with
some
profit
too
i
would
fain
hope
from
one
he
glanced
at
marion
whom
i
made
my
humble
supplication
for
forgiveness
when
i
knew
her
merit
and
my
deep
unworthiness
in
a
few
days
i
shall
quit
this
place
for
ever
i
entreat
your
pardon
do
as
you
would
be
done
by
forget
and
forgive
time
from
whom
i
had
the
latter
portion
of
this
story
and
with
whom
i
have
the
pleasure
of
a
personal
acquaintance
of
some
years
duration
informed
me
leaning
easily
upon
his
scythe
that
michael
warden
never
went
away
again
and
never
sold
his
house
but
opened
it
afresh
maintained
a
golden
means
of
hospitality
and
had
a
wife
the
pride
and
honour
of
that
countryside
whose
name
was
marion
but
as
i
have
observed
that
time
confuses
facts
occasionally
i
hardly
know
what
weight
to
give
to
his
authority
