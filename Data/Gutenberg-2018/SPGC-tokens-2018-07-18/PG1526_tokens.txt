a
bachelor
then
captain

so
is
now
or
was
so
very
late
for
but
a
month
ago
i
went
from
hence
and
then
was
fresh
in
murmur
as
you
know
what
great
ones
do
the
less
will
prattle
of
that
he
did
seek
the
love
of
fair
olivia

she
captain
a
virtuous
maid
the
daughter
of
a
count

died
some
twelvemonth

protection
of
his
son
her
brother

shortly
also
died
for
whose
dear
love
they
say
she
hath
abjured
the
company
and
sight
of
men
viola
o
that
i
served
that
lady
and
might
not
be
delivered
to
the
world
till

had
made
mine
own
occasion
mellow
what
my
estate

were
hard
to
compass
because
she
will
admit
no
kind
of
suit

there
is
a
fair
behaviour
in
thee
captain
and
though
that
nature
with
a
beauteous
wall
doth
oft
close
in
pollution
yet
of
thee
i
will
believe
thou
hast
a
mind
that
suits
with
this
thy
fair
and
outward
character

pray
thee
and
i
pay
thee
bounteously

such
disguise

my
intent

serve
this
duke
thou
shalt
present
me
as
an
eunuch
to
him
it
may
be
worth
thy
pains
for
i
can
sing
and
speak
to
him
in
many
sorts
of
music
that
will
allow
me
very
worth
his
service
what
else
may
hap
to
time

great
exceptions

her
except
before
excepted
maria
ay
but
you
must
confine
yourself
within
the
modest
limits
of
order
sir
toby
confine

confine
myself
no
finer
than
i
am
these

are
good
enough
to

so
be
these

too
an
they
be
not
let
them
hang
themselves
in
their
own
straps
maria
that
quaffing
and
drinking
will
undo
you
i
heard
my

talk
of
it
yesterday
and
of
a
foolish
knight
that
you
brought
in
one
night
here
to
be
her
wooer
sir
toby
who
sir
andrew
maria
ay
he
sir
toby
he
as
tall
a
man
as
any
in
illyria
maria
what
that
to
the
purpose
sir
toby
why
he
has
three
thousand
ducats
a
year
maria
ay
but
he
have
but
a
year
in

a

hath
all
the
good
gifts
of

maria
he
hath
indeed
almost
natural
for
besides
that
he
a
fool

a
great
quarreller

but
that
he
hath
the
gift
of
a
coward
to
allay

gust
he
hath
in

thought
among
the
prudent
he
would
quickly
have
the
gift
of
a
grave
sir

by
this
hand
they
are
scoundrels
and

estimable
wonder
overfar
believe

boldly
publish

could
not
but
call

that
piece
of
song
that
old
and
antique
song
we
heard
last

it
did
relieve
my
passion
much
more
than
light
airs
and
recollected
terms
of
these
most
brisk
and
times
come
but
one
verse
curio
he

not
here
so
please
your
lordship
that

sing
it
duke
who
was
it
curio
feste

constant
image
of
the
creature
that
is
how
dost
thou
like

very
echo
to
the
seat
where

throned

masterly
my
life
upo
young
though

there
is
no

heart
so
big
to

so
much
they
lack
retention
alas
their
love
may
be
called
appetite
no
motion
of
the
liver
but
the
palate
that
suffer
surfeit
cloyment
and
revolt
but
mine
is
all
as
hungry
as
the
sea
and
can
digest
as
much
make

a
worm
i
the
bud
feed
on
her
damask
cheek
she
pined
in
thought
and
with
a
green
and
yellow
melancholy
she
sat
like
patience
on
a
monument
smiling
at
grief
was
not
this
love
indeed
we
men
may
say
more
swear
more
but
indeed
our
shows

this
prerogative
of

sir
toby
what
what
malvolio
must
amend
your
drunkenness
sir
toby
out
scab
fabian
nay
patience
or
we
break
the
sinews
of
our
plot
malvolio
you
waste
the
treasure
of
your
time
with
a
foolish
knight
sir
andrew
that
me
i
warrant
you
malvolio
sir
andrew
sir
andrew
i
knew
was
i
for
many
do
call
me
fool
malvolio
what
employment
have
we
here
taking
up
the
letter
fabian
now
is
the
woodcock
near
the
gin
sir
toby
o
peace
and
the
spirit
of
humours
intimate
reading
aloud
to
him
malvolio
by
my
life
this
is
my
lady
hand
these
be
her
very
c
her
u
and
her
t
and
thus
makes
she
her
great
p
it
is
in
contempt
of
question
her
hand
sir
andrew
her
c
her
u
and
her
t
why
that
malvolio
reads
the
unknown
beloved
this
and
my
good
wishes
her
very
phrases
by
your
leave
soft
and
the
impressure
her
lucrece
with
which
she
uses
to
seal
is
my
lady
to
whom
should
this
be
fabian
this
wins
him
liver
and
all
malvolio
reads
knows
i
love
but
who
lips
do
not
move
no
man
must
know
man
must
know
what
follows
the
numbers
alter
man
must
know
if
this
should
be
thee
malvolio
sir
toby
marry
hang
thee
brock
malvolio
may
command
where
i
adore
but
silence
like
a
lucrece
knife
with
bloodless
stroke
my
heart
doth
gore
m
o
a
i
doth
sway
my
life
fabian
a
fustian
riddle
sir
toby
excellent
wench
say
malvolio
o
a
i
doth
sway
my
life
nay
but
first
let
me
see
let
me
see
let
me
see
fabian
what
dish
of
poison
has
she
dressed
him
sir
toby
and
with
what
wing
the
stannyel
checks
at
it
malvolio
may
command
where
i
adore
why
she
may
command
me
i
serve
her
she
is
my
lady
why
this
is
evident
to
any
formal
capacity
there
is
no
obstruction
in
this
and
the
end
what
should
that
alphabetical
position
portend
if
i
could
make
that
resemble
something
in
softly
m
o
a
sir
toby
o
ay
make
up
that
he
is
now
at
a
cold
scent
fabian
sowter
will
cry
upo
for
all
this
though
it
be
as
rank
as
a
fox
malvolio
m
malvolio
m
why
that
begins
my
name
fabian
did
not
i
say
he
would
work
it
out
the
cur
is
excellent
at
faults
malvolio
m
but
then
there
is
no
consonancy
in
the
sequel
that
suffers
under
probation
a
should
follow
but
o
does
fabian
and
o
shall
end
i
hope
sir
toby
ay
or
i
cudgel
him
and
make
him
cry
malvolio
and
then
i
comes
behind
fabian
ay
an
you
had
any
eye
behind
you
you
might
see
more
detraction
at
your
heels
than
fortunes
before
you
malvolio
m
o
a
i
this
simulation
is
not
as
the
former
and
yet
to
crush
this
a
little
it
would
bow
to
me
for
every
one
of
these
letters
are
in
my
name
soft
here
follows
this
fall
into
thy
hand
revolve
in
my
stars
i
am
above
thee
but
be
not
afraid
of
greatness
some
are
born
great
some
achieve
greatness
and
some
have
greatness
thrust
upon
them
thy
fates
open
their
hands
let
thy
blood
and
spirit
embrace
them
and
to
inure
thyself
to
what
thou
art
like
to
be
cast
thy
humble
slough
and
appear
fresh
be
opposite
with
a
kinsman
surly
with
servants
let
thy
tongue
tang
arguments
of
state
put
thyself
into
the
trick
of
singularity
she
thus
advises
thee
that
sighs
for
thee
remember
who
commended
thy
yellow
stockings
and
wished
to
see
thee
ever
i
say
remember
go

thou
desirest
to
be
so
if
not
let
me
see
thee
a
steward

the
fellow
of
servants
and
not
worthy
to
touch
fortune
fingers

will
be
the
very
man

do
not
now
fool
myself
to
let
imagination
jade
me
for
every
reason
excites
to
this
that
my
lady
loves
me
she
did
commend
my
yellow
stockings
of
late
she
did
praise
my
leg
being
and
in
this
she
manifests
herself
to
my
love
and
with
a
kind
of
injunction
drives
me
to
these
habits
of
her
liking
i
thank
my
stars
i
am
happy
i
will
be
strange
stout
in
yellow
stockings
and
even
with
the
swiftness
of
putting
on
jove
and
my
stars
be
praised
here
is
yet
a
postscript

not
choose
but
know
who
i
am
if
thou
entertainest
my
love
let
it
appear
in
thy
smiling
thy
smiles

thee
well
therefore
in
my
presence

sweet

thank
thee

will
smile

will
do
everything
that
thou
wilt
have
me
exit
fabian

will
not
give
my
part
of
this
sport
for
a
pension
of
thousands
to
be
paid
from
the
sophy
sir
toby
i
could
marry
this
wench

this

other
dowry
with

or
i
either
sir
toby

thou
hast
put
him
in
such
a
dream
that
when
the
image
of
it
leaves
him
he
must
run
mad
maria
nay
but
say
true
does
it
work
upon
him
sir
toby
like
with
a
midwife
maria
if
you
will
then
see
the
fruits
of
the
sport
mark
his
first
approach
before
my
lady
he
will
come
to
her
in
yellow
stockings
and
is
a
colour
she
abhors
and
a
fashion
she
detests
and
he
will
smile
upon
her
which
will
now
be
so
unsuitable
to
her
disposition
being
addicted
to
a
melancholy
as
she
is
that
it
can
not
but
turn
him
into
a
notable
contempt
if
you
will
see
it
follow
me

the
gates
of

quality
of
persons

the
time
and
like
the
haggard
check
at

name

your
servant
name
fair
princess
olivia
my
servant
sir
was
never
merry
world
since
lowly
feigning
was
call
compliment

are
servant
to
the
count
orsino
youth
viola
and
he
is
yours
and
his
must
needs
be
yours
your
servant
servant
is
your
servant
madam
olivia
for
him
i
think
not
on
him
for
his
thoughts
would
they
were
blanks
rather
than
fill
with
me
viola
madam
i
come
to
whet
your
gentle
thoughts
on
his
behalf
olivia
o
by
your
leave
i
pray
you
i
bade
you
never
speak
again
of
him
but
would
you
undertake
another
suit
i
had
rather
hear
you
to
solicit
that
than
music
from
the
spheres
viola
dear
lady
olivia
give
me
leave
beseech
you
i
did
send
after
the
last
enchantment
you
did
here
a
ring
in
chase
of
you
so
did
i
abuse
myself
my
servant
and
i
fear
me
you
under
your
hard
construction
must
i
sit
to
force
that
on
you
in
a
shameful
cunning
which
you
knew
none
of
yours
what
might
you
think
have
you
not
set
mine
honour
at
the
stake
and
baited
it
with
all
the
unmuzzl
thoughts
that
tyrannous
heart
can
think
to
one
of
your
receiving
enough
is
shown
a
cypress
not
a
bosom
hides
my
heart
so
let
me
hear
you
speak
viola
i
pity
you
olivia
that
a
degree
to
love
viola
no
not
a
grise
for
is
a
vulgar
proof
that
very
oft
we
pity
enemies
olivia
why
then
methinks
is
time
to
smile
again
o
world
how
apt
the
poor
are
to
be
proud
if
one
should
be
a
prey
how
much
the
better
to
fall
before
the
lion
than
the
wolf
clock
strikes
the
clock
upbraids
me
with
the
waste
of
be
not
afraid
good
youth
i
will
not
have
you
and
yet
when
wit
and
youth
is
come
to
harvest
your
wife
is
like
to
reap
a
proper
man
there
lies
your
way
viola
then
grace
and
good
disposition
your
ladyship
you
nothing
madam
to
my
lord
by
me
olivia
stay
i
tell
me
what
thou
of
me
viola
that
you
do
think
you
are
not
what
you
are
olivia
if
i
think
so
i
think
the
same
of
you
viola
then
think
you
right
i
am
not
what
i
am
olivia
i
would
you
were
as
i
would
have
you
be
viola
would
it
be
better
madam
than
i
am
i
wish
it
might
for
now
i
am
your
fool
olivia
o
what
a
deal
of
scorn
looks
beautiful
in
the
contempt
and
anger
of
his
lip
a
guilt
shows
not
itself
more
soon
than
love
that
would
seem
hid
love
night
is
noon
cesario
by
the
roses
of
the
spring
by
maidhood
honour
truth
and
everything
i
love
thee
so
that
maugre
all
thy
pride
nor
wit
nor
reason
can
my
passion
hide
do
not
extort
thy
reasons
from
this
clause
for
that
i
woo
thou
therefore
hast
no
cause
but
rather
reason
thus
with
reason
fetter
love
sought
is
good
but
given
unsought
is
better
viola
by
innocence
i
swear
and
by
my
youth
i
have
one
heart
one
bosom
and
one
truth
and
that
no
woman
has
nor
never
none
shall
mistress
be
of
it
save
i
alone
and
so
adieu
good
madam
never
more
will
i
my
master
tears
to
you
deplore
olivia
yet
come
again
for
thou
perhaps
mayst
move
that
heart
which
now
abhors
to
like
his
love
exeunt
scene
ii
a
room
in
olivia
house
enter
sir
toby
belch
sir
andrew
and
fabian
sir
andrew
no
faith
i
not
stay
a
jot
longer
sir
toby
thy
reason
dear
venom
give
thy
reason
fabian
you
must
needs
yield
your
reason
sir
andrew
sir
andrew
marry
i
saw
your
niece
do
more
favours
to
the
servingman
than
ever
she
bestowed
upon
me
i
i
the
orchard
sir
toby
did
she
see
thee
the
while
old
boy
tell
me
that
sir
andrew
as
plain
as
i
see
you
now
fabian
this
was
a
great
argument
of
love
in
her
toward
you
sir
andrew
will
you
make
an
ass
o
me
fabian
i
will
prove
it
legitimate
sir
upon
the
oaths
of
judgment
and
reason
sir
toby
and
they
have
been
grand
jurymen
since
before
noah
was
a
sailor
fabian
she
did
show
favour
to
the
youth
in
your
sight
only
to
exasperate
you
to
awake
your
dormouse
valour
to
put
fire
in
your
heart
and
brimstone
in
your
liver
you
should
then
have
accosted
her
and
with
some
excellent
jests
from
the
mint
you
should
have
banged
the
youth
into
dumbness
this
was
looked
for
at
your
hand
and
this
was
baulked
the
double
gilt
of
this
opportunity
you
let
time
wash
off
and
you
are
now
sailed
into
the
north
of
my
lady
opinion
where
you
will
hang
like
an
icicle
on
dutchman
beard
unless
you
do
redeem
it
by
some
laudable
attempt
either
of
valour
or
policy
sir
andrew
be
any
way
it
must
be
with
valour
for
policy
i
hate
i
had
as
lief
be
a
brownist
as
a
politician
sir
toby
why
then
build
me
thy
fortunes
upon
the
basis
of
valour
challenge
me
the
count
youth
to
fight
with
him
hurt
him
in
eleven
places
my
niece
shall
take
note
of
it
and
assure
thyself
there
is
no
in
the
world
can
more
prevail
in
man
commendation
with
woman
than
report
of
valour
fabian
there
is
no
way
but
this
sir
andrew
sir
andrew
will
either
of
you
bear
me
a
challenge
to
him
sir
toby
go
write
it
in
a
martial
hand
be
curst
and
brief
it
is
no
matter
how
witty
so
it
be
eloquent
and
full
of
invention
taunt
him
with
the
licence
of
ink
if
thou
him
some
thrice
it
shall
not
be
amiss
and
as
many
lies
as
will
lie
in
thy
sheet
of
paper
although
the
sheet
were
big
enough
for
the
bed
of
ware
in
england
set
down
go
about
it
let
there
be
gall
enough
in
thy
ink
though
thou
write
with
a
no
matter
about
it
sir
andrew
where
shall
i
find
you
sir
toby
we
call
thee
at
the
cubiculo
go
exit
sir
andrew
fabian
this
is
a
dear
manakin
to
you
sir
toby
sir
toby
i
have
been
dear
to
him
lad
some
two
thousand
strong
or
so
fabian
we
shall
have
a
rare
letter
from
him
but
you
not
deliver
it
sir
toby
never
trust
me
then
and
by
all
means
stir
on
the
youth
to
an
answer
i
think
oxen
and
wainropes
can
not
hale
them
together
for
andrew
if
he
were
opened
and
you
find
so
much
blood
in
his
liver
as
will
clog
the
foot
of
a
flea
i
eat
the
rest
of
the
anatomy
fabian
and
his
opposite
the
youth
bears
in
his
visage
no
great
presage
of
cruelty
enter
maria
sir
toby
look
where
the
youngest
wren
of
nine
comes
maria
if
you
desire
the
spleen
and
will
laugh
yourselves
into
stitches
follow
me
yond
gull
malvolio
is
turned
heathen
a
very
renegado
for
there
is
no
christian
that
means
to
be
saved
by
believing
rightly
can
ever
believe
such
impossible
passages
of
grossness
he
in
yellow
stockings
sir
toby
and
maria
most
villainously
like
a
pedant
that
keeps
a
school
i
the
i
have
dogged
him
like
his
murderer
he
does
obey
every
point
of
the
letter
that
i
dropped
to
betray
him
he
does
smile
his
face
into
more
lines
than
is
in
the
new
map
with
the
augmentation
of
the
indies
you
have
not
seen
such
a
thing
as
i
can
hardly
forbear
hurling
things
at
him
i
know
my
lady
will
strike
him
if
she
do
he
smile
and
for
a
great
favour
sir
toby
come
bring
us
bring
us
where
he
is
exeunt
scene
iii
a
street
enter
antonio
and
sebastian
sebastian
i
would
not
by
my
will
have
troubled
you
but
since
you
make
your
pleasure
of
your
pains
i
will
no
further
chide
you
antonio
i
could
not
stay
behind
you
my
desire
more
sharp
than
filed
steel
did
spur
me
forth
and
not
all
love
to
see
you
though
so
much
as
might
have
drawn
one
to
a
longer
voyage
but
jealousy
what
might
befall
your
travel
being
skilless
in
these
parts
which
to
a
stranger
unguided
and
unfriended
often
prove
rough
and
unhospitable
my
willing
love
the
rather
by
these
arguments
of
fear
set
forth
in
your
pursuit
sebastian
my
kind
antonio
i
can
no
other
answer
make
but
thanks
and
thanks
and
ever
thanks
often
good
turns
are
shuffled
off
with
such
uncurrent
pay
but
were
my
worth
as
is
my
conscience
firm
you
should
find
better
dealing
what
to
do
shall
we
go
see
the
reliques
of
this
town
antonio
sir
best
first
go
see
your
lodging
sebastian
i
am
not
weary
and
is
long
to
night
i
pray
you
let
us
satisfy
our
eyes
with
the
memorials
and
the
things
of
fame
that
do
renown
this
city
antonio
would
you
pardon
me
i
do
not
without
danger
walk
these
streets
once
in
a
the
count
his
galleys
i
did
some
service
of
such
note
indeed
that
were
i
here
it
would
scarce
be
answered
sebastian
belike
you
slew
great
number
of
his
people
antonio
the
offence
is
not
of
such
a
bloody
nature
albeit
the
quality
of
the
time
and
quarrel
might
well
have
given
us
bloody
argument
it
might
have
since
been
answered
in
repaying
what
we
took
from
them
which
for
traffic
sake
most
of
our
city
did
only
myself
stood
out
for
which
if
i
be
lapsed
in
this
place
i
shall
pay
dear
sebastian
do
not
then
walk
too
open
antonio
it
doth
not
fit
me
hold
sir

south
suburbs

the
time
and
feed
your
knowledge
with
viewing
of
the
town
there
shall
you
have
me
sebastian
why

haply
your
eye
shall
light
upon
some
toy

think
is
not
for
idle
markets

sad
and
civil
and
suits
well
for
a
servant
with
my
fortunes
where

malvolio
maria
he
coming
madam
but
in
very
strange
manner

he
rave
maria
no
madam
he
does
nothing
but
smile
your

tainted

eye
of

malvolio
o
ho
do
you
come
near
me
now
no
worse
man
than
sir
toby
to
look
to
me
this
concurs
directly
with
the
letter
she
sends
him
on
purpose
that
i
may
appear
stubborn
to
him
for
she
incites
me
to
that
in
the
letter
thy
humble
slough
says
she
opposite
with
a
kinsman
surly
with
servants
let
thy
tongue
tang
with
arguments
of
state
put
thyself
into
the
trick
of
singularity
and
consequently
sets
down
the
manner
how
as
a
sad
face
a
reverend
carriage
a
slow
tongue
in
the
habit
of
some
sir
of
note
and
so
forth
i
have
limed
her
but
it
is
jove
doing

me
thankful
and
when
she
went
away
now
this
fellow
be
looked
to
fellow
not
malvolio
nor
after
my
degree
but
fellow
why
everything
adheres
together
that
no
dram
of
a
scruple
no
scruple
of
a
scruple
no
obstacle
no
incredulous
or
unsafe
circumstance
what
can
be
said
nothing
that
can
be
can
come
between
me
and
the
full
prospect
of
my
hopes
well
jove

the
doer
of
this

in
thy
mind
why

do
call
thee

for
i
will
show

no
reason
fabian
a
good
note
that
keeps
you
from
the
blow
of
the
law
sir

comest
to
the
lady

but
thou
liest
in
thy
throat
that

matter
i
challenge
thee
for
fabian
very
brief
and
to
exceeding
good
senseless
sir

going
home
where
if

thy
chance
to
kill
me
fabian
good

like
a
rogue
and
a
villain

mercy
upon

of

my
hope

and
so
look
to
thyself
thy
friend
as
thou
usest
him
and
thy
sworn
enemy
andrew
if
this
letter
move
him
not
his
legs

not
i
him
maria
you
may
have
very
fit
occasion
he

corner
of
the
orchard
like
a
so
soon
as
ever
thou
seest
him
draw
and
as
thou
drawest
swear
horrible
for
it
comes
to
pass
oft
that
a
terrible
oath
with
a
swaggering
accent
sharply
twanged
off
gives
manhood
more
approbation
than
ever
proof
itself
would
have
earned
him
away
sir
andrew
nay
let
me
alone
for
swearing
exit
sir

deliver

him
out
to
be
of
good
capacity
and
breeding
his
employment
between
his
lord
and
my
niece
confirms
no
less
therefore
this
letter
being
so
excellently
ignorant
will
breed
no
terror
in
the
youth
he
will
find
it
comes
from
a
clodpole
but
sir
i
will
deliver
his
challenge
by
word
of
mouth
set
upon
notable
report
of
valour

drive
the
gentleman
as
i
know
his
youth
will
aptly
receive
it
into
a
most
hideous
opinion
of
his
rage
skill
fury
and
impetuosity
this
will
so
fright
them
both
that
they
will
kill

this
pearl

gave
me
i
do

and
though
is
wonder
that
enwraps
me
thus
yet
is
not
madness
where
antonio
then
i
could
not
find
him
at
the
elephant
yet
there
he
was
and
there
i
found
this
credit
that
he
did
range
the
town
to
seek
me
out
his
counsel
now
might
do
me
golden
service
for
though
my
soul
disputes
well
with
my
sense
that
this
may
be
some
error
but
no
madness
yet
doth
this
accident
and
flood
of

so
far
exceed
all
instance
all
discourse
that
i
am
ready
to
distrust
mine
eyes
and
wrangle
with
my
reason
that
persuades
me
to
any
other
trust

that
i

a
smooth
discreet

shallow

such
scathful
grapple
did
he
make
with
the
most
noble
bottom

very
envy
and
the
tongue
of
los
cried
fame
and
honour

is
that
antonio

was
beset
where
being
apprehended
his
false
cunning
not
meaning
to
partake
with

in
danger
taught
him
to
face
me
out
of
his
acquaintance

grew
a
thing
while
one
would
wink
denied
me
mine
own
purse

everywhere
i
had
a
sister
whom
the
blind
waves
and
surges
have
devoured
to

what
kin
are
you
to

what
countryman
what
name
what
parentage
viola
of
messaline
sebastian
was
my

such
a
sebastian
was
my

and
suit
you
come
to
fright
us
sebastian
a
spirit
i
am
indeed

am
in
that
dimension
grossly
clad
which
from
the
womb
i
did
participate
were
you
a
woman
as
the
rest
goes
even
i
should
my
tears
let
fall
upon
your
cheek
and
say
thrice
welcome
drowned
viola
viola
my
father
had
a
mole
upon
his
brow
sebastian
and
so
had
mine
viola
and
died
that
day
when
viola
from
her
birth
had
numbered
thirteen
years

that
record
is
lively
in
my
soul
he
finished
indeed
his
mortal
act
that
day
that
made
my
sister
thirteen
years

us
happy
both

a
thousand
times

your

for
your
service
done

so
much
against
the
mettle
of
your

beneath

soft
and
tender
breeding
and
since
you
called

for
so
long
here

my
hand
you
shall
from
this
time
be
you
master

no
malvolio
lady
you
have
pray
you
peruse
that
letter
you
must
not
now
deny
it
is
your
hand
write
from
it
if
you
can
in
hand
or
phrase
or
say
is
not
your
seal
not
your
invention
you
can
say
none
of
this
well
grant
it
then
and
tell
me
in
the
modesty
of
honour
why
you
have
given
me
such
clear
lights
of
favour
bade
me
come
smiling
and
to
you
to
put
on
yellow
stockings
and
to
frown
upon
sir
toby
and
the
lighter
people
and
acting
this
in
an
obedient
hope
why
have
you
suffer
me
to
be
imprison
kept
in
a
dark
house
visited
by
the
priest
and
made
the
most
notorious
geck
and
gull
that
invention
played
on
tell
me
why
olivia
alas
malvolio
this
is
not
my
writing
though
i
confess
much
like
the
character
but
out
of
question
is
maria
hand
and
now
i
do
bethink
me
it
was
she
first
told
me
thou
wast
mad
then
in
smiling
and
in
such
forms
which
here
were
upon
thee
in
the
letter
be
content
this
practice
hath
most
shrewdly
pass
upon
thee
but
when
we
know
the
grounds
and
authors
of
it
thou
shalt
be
both
the
plaintiff
and
the
judge
of
thine
own
cause
fabian
good
madam
hear
me
speak
and
let
no
quarrel
nor
no
brawl
to
come
taint
the
condition
of
this
present
hour
which
i
have
wonder
at
in
hope
it
shall
not
most
freely
i
confess
myself
and
toby
set
this
device
against
malvolio
here
upon
some
stubborn
and
uncourteous
parts
we
had
conceiv
against
him
maria
writ
the
letter
at
sir
toby
great
importance
in
recompense
whereof
he
hath
married
her
how
with
a
sportful
malice
it
was
may
rather
pluck
on
laughter
than
revenge
if
that
the
injuries
be
justly
that
have
on
both
sides
past
olivia
alas
poor
fool
how
have
they
baffled
thee
clown
why
are
born
great
some
achieve
greatness
and
some
have
greatness
thrown
upon
them
i
was
one
sir
in
this
interlude
one
sir
topas
sir
but
that
all
one
the
lord
fool
i
am
not
mad
but
do
you
remember
why
laugh
you
at
such
a
barren
rascal
an
you
smile
not
gagged
and
thus
the
whirligig
of
time
brings
in
his
revenges
malvolio
i
be
revenged
on
the
whole
pack
of
you
exit
olivia
he
hath
been
most
notoriously
abus
duke
pursue
him
and
entreat
him
to
a
peace
he
hath
not
told
us
of
the
captain
yet
when
that
is
known
and
golden
time
convents
a
solemn
combination
shall
be
made
of
our
dear
meantime
sweet

we
will
not
part
from

you
shall
