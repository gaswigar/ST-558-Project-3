conclusion
i
the
trial
during
the
first
two
months
of
the
year
the
greatest
possible
excitement
existed
in
dublin
respecting
the
state
trials
in
which
mr
his
son
the
editors
of
three
different
repeal
newspapers
tom
steele
the
rev
mr
tierney
a
priest
who
had
taken
a
somewhat
prominent
part
in
the
repeal
movement
and
mr
ray
the
secretary
to
the
repeal
association
were
indicted
for
conspiracy
those
who
only
read
of
the
proceedings
in
papers
which
gave
them
as
a
mere
portion
of
the
news
of
the
day
or
learned
what
was
going
on
in
dublin
by
chance
conversation
can
have
no
idea
of
the
absorbing
interest
which
the
whole
affair
created
in
ireland
but
more
especially
in
the
metropolis
every
one
felt
strongly
on
one
side
or
on
the
other
every
one
had
brought
the
matter
home
to
his
own
bosom
and
looked
to
the
result
of
the
trial
with
individual
interest
and
suspense
footnote
the
historical
events
described
here
form
a
backdrop
to
the
novel
daniel
came
from
a
wealthy
irish
catholic
family
he
was
educated
in
the
law
which
he
practiced
most
successfully
and
developed
a
passion
for
religious
and
political
liberty
in
together
with
lalor
sheil
and
thomas
wyse
he
organized
the
catholic
association
whose
major
goal
was
catholic
emancipation
this
was
achieved
by
act
of
parliament
the
following
year
served
in
parliament
in
the
and
was
active
in
the
passage
of
bills
emancipating
the
jews
and
outlawing
slavery
in
he
formed
the
repeal
association
whose
goal
was
repeal
of
the
act
of
union
which
joined
ireland
to
great
britain
in
after
serving
a
year
as
lord
mayor
of
dublin
challenged
the
british
government
by
announcing
that
he
intended
to
achieve
repeal
within
a
year
though
he
openly
opposed
violence
prime
minister
peel
government
considered
him
a
threat
and
arrested
and
his
associates
in
on
charges
of
conspiracy
sedition
and
unlawfule
assembly
they
were
tried
in
and
all
but
one
were
convicted
although
the
conviction
was
later
overturned
in
the
house
of
lords
did
serve
some
time
in
jail
and
was
considered
a
martyr
to
the
cause
of
irish
independence
even
at
this
short
interval
irishmen
can
now
see
how
completely
they
put
judgment
aside
and
allowed
feeling
and
passion
to
predominate
in
the
matter
many
of
the
hottest
protestants
of
the
staunchest
foes
to
now
believe
that
his
absolute
imprisonment
was
not
to
be
desired
and
that
whether
he
were
acquitted
or
convicted
the
government
would
have
sufficiently
shown
by
instituting
his
trial
its
determination
to
put
down
proceedings
of
which
they
did
not
approve
on
the
other
hand
that
class
of
men
who
then
styled
themselves
repealers
are
now
aware
that
the
continued
imprisonment
of
their
leader
the
persecution
as
they
believed
it
to
be
of
the
liberator
would
have
been
the
one
thing
most
certain
to
have
sustained
his
influence
and
to
have
given
fresh
force
to
their
agitation
nothing
ever
so
strengthened
the
love
of
the
irish
for
and
the
obedience
of
the
irish
to
as
his
imprisonment
nothing
ever
so
weakened
his
power
over
them
as
his
unexpected
enfranchisement
the
country
shouted
for
joy
when
he
was
set
free
and
expended
all
its
enthusiasm
in
the
effort
footnote
the
irish
often
referred
to
daniel
as
the
liberator
footnote
enfranchisement
being
set
free
this
is
a
political
observation
by
trollope
at
the
time
however
to
which
i
am
now
referring
each
party
felt
the
most
intense
interest
in
the
struggle
and
the
most
eager
desire
for
success
every
repealer
and
every
in
dublin
felt
that
it
was
a
contest
in
which
he
himself
was
to
a
certain
extent
individually
engaged
all
the
tactics
of
the
opposed
armies
down
to
the
minutest
legal
details
were
eagerly
and
passionately
canvassed
in
every
circle
ladies
who
had
before
probably
never
heard
of
panels
in
forensic
phraseology
now
spoke
enthusiastically
on
the
subject
and
those
on
one
side
expressed
themselves
indignant
at
the
fraudulent
omission
of
certain
names
from
the
lists
of
jurors
while
those
on
the
other
were
capable
of
proving
the
legality
of
choosing
the
jury
from
the
names
which
were
given
and
stated
most
positively
that
the
omissions
were
accidental
the
traversers
were
in
everybody
mouth
a
term
heretofore
confined
to
law
courts
and
lawyers
rooms
the
the
of
the
government
forces
was
most
virulently
assailed
every
legal
step
which
he
took
was
scrutinised
and
abused
every
measure
which
he
used
was
base
enough
of
itself
to
hand
down
his
name
to
everlasting
infamy
such
were
the
tenets
of
the
repealers
and
and
his
counsel
their
base
artifices
falsehoods
delays
and
unprofessional
proceedings
were
declared
by
the
saxon
party
to
be
equally
abominable
footnote
traversers
trollope
repeatedly
refers
to
the
defendants
as
traversers
the
term
probably
comes
from
the
legal
term
to
traverse
which
is
to
deny
the
charges
against
one
in
a
common
law
proceeding
thus
the
traversers
would
have
been
those
who
pled
innocent
the
whole
irish
bar
seemed
for
the
time
to
have
laid
aside
the
habitual
and
indifference
of
lawyers
and
to
have
employed
their
hearts
as
well
as
their
heads
on
behalf
of
the
different
parties
by
whom
they
were
engaged
the
very
jurors
themselves
for
a
time
became
famous
or
infamous
according
to
the
opinions
of
those
by
whom
their
position
was
discussed
their
names
and
additions
were
published
and
republished
they
were
declared
to
be
men
who
would
stand
by
their
country
and
do
their
duty
without
fear
or
favour
so
said
the
protestants
by
the
roman
catholics
they
were
looked
on
as
perjurors
determined
to
stick
to
the
government
with
blind
indifference
to
their
oaths
their
names
are
now
for
the
most
part
forgotten
though
so
little
time
has
elapsed

gave
rise
to

the
evidence
rested
chiefly
on
the
reports
of
certain
writers
who
had
been
employed
to
attend
repeal
meetings
and
their
examinations
and
were
read
and

seemed
as

and
were

for
some

honour
which
each

to
you
whether
you
were
reading
the

mail
or

every
word
that
was
uttered
in

was
of

in
dublin
and
delay
in
ascertaining
to
the
minutest
shade
what
had
taken
place
in
court
during
any
period
was
accounted
a
sad
misfortune
the
press
round
the
four
courts
every
morning
before
the
doors
were
open
was
very
great
and
except
by
the
favoured
few
who
were
able
to
obtain
seats
it
was
only
with
extreme
difficulty
and
perseverance
that
an
entrance
into
the
body
of
the
court
could
be
obtained
footnote

on

day
on
which
the

of

was
to
be
commenced
that
two
young
men
who
had
been
standing
for
a
couple
of
hours
in
front
of
the
doors
of
the
court
were
still
waiting
there
with
what
patience
was
left
to
them
after
having
been
pressed
and
jostled
for
so
long
a
time
richard
lalor
sheil
however
was
to
address
the
jury
on
behalf

mr
john

every
one
in
dublin
knew
that
that
was
a
treat
not
to
be
lost
the
two
young
men
too
were
violent
repealers
the
elder
of
them
was
a
denizen
of
dublin
who
knew
the
names
of
the
contributors
to
the
nation
who
had
constantly
listened
to
the
indignation
and
enthusiasm
of
smith

during
his
life
in

done
many
things
which

done
and
had
probably
made
as
many
omissions
of
things
which
it
had
behoved
him
to
do
he
had
that
knowledge
of
the
persons
of
his
which
appears
to
be
so
much
more
general
in
dublin
than
in
any
other
large
town
he
could
tell
you
the
name
and
trade
of
every
one
he
met
in
the
streets
and
was

the
character
and
talents
of
all
whose
employments
partook
in
any
degree
of
a
public
nature
his
name
was
kelly
and
as
his
calling
was
that
of
an
attorney
clerk
his
knowledge

perhaps
a
more
enthusiastic

was
a
young
fellow
about
years
of
age
with
that
mixture
of
cunning
and
frankness
in
his
bright
eye

is
so
common
among

could
not
be
in

much
of

kind
of

some
ten

put
her
shoulders
to

earned
comfortably
by
sheer
industry
that
which
so
many
of
her
class
when
similarly
situated

confessed
with
most
scrupulous
accuracy
the
various
peccadillos
of
which
she
might

thought
with
reason
by
those
who
knew
her
best
that
all
the
extra
prayers
she
said

in

she
would
not

was
always

unawares
had
seen
her
extracting
the
pinches
of
moist
brown
saccharine
from
the
huge
slit
in
her
petticoat
and
could
not
believe
her
kate
the
other
servant
was
a
lass
who
washed
the
potatoes
fed
the
pigs
and
ate
her
food
nobody
knew
when
or
where
kates
particularly
irish
kates
are
pretty
by
prescription
but
kelly
kate
had
been
excepted
and
was
certainly
a
most
positive
exception
poor
kate
was
very
ugly
her
hair
had
that
appearance
of
having
been
dressed
by
the
which
is
sometimes
presented
by
the
heads
of
young
women
in
her
situation
her
mouth
extended
nearly
from
ear
to
ear
her
neck
and
throat
which
were
always
nearly
bare
presented
no
feminine
charms
to
view
and
her
short
coarse
petticoat
showed
her
red
legs
nearly
to
the
knee
for
except
on
sundays
she
knew
not
the
use
of
shoes
and
stockings
but
though
kate
was
ungainly
and
ugly
she
was
useful
and
grateful
very
fond
of
the
whole
family
and
particularly
attached
to
the
two
young
ladies
in
whose
behalf
she
doubtless
performed
many
a
service
acceptable
enough
to
them
but
of
which
had
she
known
of
them
the
widow
would
have
been
but
little
likely
to
approve
such
was
kelly
household
at
the
time
that
her
son
martin
left
connaught
to
pay
a
short
visit
to
the
metropolis
during
the
period
of
trial
but
although
martin
was
a
staunch
repealer
and
had
gone
as
far
as
galway
and
athlone
to
be
present
at
the
monster
repeal
meetings
which
had
been
held
there
it
was
not
political
anxiety
alone
which
led
him
to
dublin
his
landlord
the
young
lord
ballindine
was
there
and
though
martin
could
not
exactly
be
said
to
act
as
his
lordship
agent
for
lord
ballindine
had
unfortunately
a
legal
agent
with
whose
services
his
pecuniary
embarrassments
did
not
allow
him
to
dispense
he
was
a
kind
of
confidential
tenant
and
his
attendance
had
been
requested
martin
moreover
had
a
somewhat
important
piece
of
business
of
his
own
in
hand
which
he
expected
would
tend
greatly
to
his
own
advantage
and
although
he
had
fully
made
up
his
mind
to
carry
it
out
if
possible
he
wanted
in
conducting
it
a
little
of
his
brother
legal
advice
and
above
all
his
sanction
this
business
was
nothing
less
than
an
intended
elopement
with
an
heiress
belonging
to
a
rank
somewhat
higher
than
that
in
which
martin
kelly
might
be
supposed
to
look
with
propriety
for
his
bride
but
martin
was
a
handsome
fellow
not
much
burdened
with
natural
modesty
and
he
had
as
he
supposed
managed
to
engage
the
affections
of
anastasia
lynch
a
lady
resident
near
dunmore
all
particulars
respecting
martin
intended
the
amount
of
her
fortune
her
birth
and
parentage
her
age
and
attractions
shall
in
due
time
be
made
known
or
rather
perhaps
be
suffered
to
make
themselves
known
in
the
mean
time
we
will
return
to
the
two
brothers
who
are
still
anxiously
waiting
to
effect
an
entrance
into
the
august
presence
of
the
law
martin
had
already
told
his
brother
of
his
matrimonial
speculations
and
had
received
certain
hints
from
that
learned
youth
as
to
the
proper
means
of
getting
correct
information
as
to
the
amount
of
the
wealth
her
power
to
dispose
of
it
by
her
own
deed
and
certain
other
particulars
always
interesting
to
gentlemen
who
seek
money
and
love
at
the
same
time
john
did
not
quite
approve
of
the
plan
there
might
have
been
a
shade
of
envy
at
his
brother
good
fortune
there
might
be
some
doubt
as
to
his
brother
power
of
carrying
the
affair
through
successfully
but
though
he
had
not
encouraged
him
he
gave
him
the
information
he
wanted
and
was
as
willing
to
talk
over
the
matter
as
martin
could
desire
as
they
were
standing
in
the
crowd
their
conversation
ran
partly
on
repeal
and
and
partly
on
matrimony
and
anty
lynch
as
the
lady
was
usually
called
by
those
who
knew
her
best
tear
and
misther
lord
chief
justice
exclaimed
martin
and
are
ye
niver
going
to
opin
them
big
doors
and
what
be
the
good
of
his
opening
them
yet
answered
john
when
a
bigger
man
than
himself
a
there
dan
and
the
other
boys
is
in
it
yet
and
sure
all
the
twelve
judges
could
get
on
a
peg
without
them
well
dan
my
darling
said
the
other
you
thought
more
of
here
this
day
than
the
lot
of
though
the
place
in
a
manner
belongs
to
them
and
you
only
a
prisoner
faix
and
that
what
he
not
martin
no
more
than
yourself
nor
so
likely
he
the
traverser
as
i
told
you
before
and
not
being
a
prisoner
if
he
were
a
prisoner
how
did
he
manage
to
tell
us
all
what
he
did
at
the
hall
yesterday
av
he
not
a
prisoner
he
the
to
it
it
not
of
his
own
free
will
and
pleasure
he
come
here
to
listen
to
all
the
lies
them
thundhering
saxon
ruffians
choose
to
say
about
him
and
why
not
why
would
he
come
here
and
vindicate
himself
when
you
hear
sheil
by
and
by
you
see
then
whether
they
think
themselves
likely
to
be
prisoners
no
no
they
never
will
be
av
there
a
ghost
of
a
conscience
left
in
one
of
them
protesthant
raps
that
picked
so
carefully
out
of
all
dublin
to
make
jurors
of
they
convict
i
heard
ford
the
night
before
last
offer
four
to
one
that
they
did
find
the
lot
guilty
and
he
knows
what
he
about
and
is
the
man
to
thrust
a
protestant
half
as
far
as
he
see
him
is
tom
steele
a
protesthant
himself
john
well
i
believe
he
is
so
gray
and
more
of
too
but
there
a
difference
between
them
and
the
downright
murdhering
tory
set
poor
tom
does
throuble
the
church
much
but
you
be
all
for
protesthants
now
martin
when
you
your
new
barry
used
to
be
one
of
your
raal
it
little
i
thinking
i
and
barry
be
having
to
do
together
unless
it
be
about
the
brads
and
the
law
about
them
now
thank
god
makes
no
differ
for
roman
and
protesthant
anty
as
good
a
catholic
as
ever
breathed
and
so
was
her
mother
before
her
and
when
she
mrs
kelly
as
i
mane
to
make
her
master
barry
may
shell
out
the
cash
and
go
to
heaven
his
own
way
for
me
it
ai
the
family
then
you
fond
of
martin
and
i
wondher
at
that
considering
how
old
sim
loved
us
all
niver
mind
sim
john
he
dead
and
gone
and
av
he
niver
did
a
good
deed
before
he
did
one
when
he
did
lave
all
his
cash
to
that
precious
son
of
his
barry
lynch
you
prepared
for
squalls
with
barry
i
suppose
he
have
all
the
squalling
on
his
own
side
i
thinking
john
i
do
mane
to
squall
for
one
i
do
see
why
i
need
with
in
my
pocket
and
a
good
wife
to
the
fore
the
good
enough
av
you
touch
it
certainly
said
the
man
of
law
thinking
of
his
own
insufficient
guinea
and
you
must
look
to
have
some
throuble
yet
afore
you
do
that
but
as
to
the
wife
why
the
less
said
the
better
eh
martin
av
it
not
asking
too
much
might
i
throuble
you
sir
to
set
anywhere
else
but
on
my
shouldher
this
was
addressed
to
a
very
fat
citizen
who
was
wheezing
behind
martin
and
who
to
escape
suffocation
in
the
crowd
was
endeavouring
to
raise
himself
on
his
shoulders
and
why
the
less
said
the
better
i
wish
yourself
may
never
have
a
worse
i
wish
i
may
martin
as
far
as
the
cash
goes
and
a
man
like
me
might
look
a
long
time
in
dublin
before
he
got
a
quarter
of
the
money
but
you
must
own
anty
no
great
beauty
and
she
not
over
young
either
av
she
no
beauty
she
not
downright
ugly
like
many
a
girl
that
gets
a
good
husband
and
av
she
not
over
young
she
not
over
old
she
not
so
much
older
than
myself
after
all
it
only
because
her
own
people
have
always
made
nothing
of
her
that
what
has
made
everybody
else
do
the
same
why
martin
i
know
she
ten
years
older
than
barry
and
older
than
you
one
year
and
anty
not
full
ten
years
older
than
him
besides
what
ten
years
between
man
and
wife
not
much
when
it
on
the
right
side
but
it
the
wrong
side
with
you
martin
well
john
now
by
virtue
of
your
oath
as
you
chaps
say
you
marry
a
woman
twice
her
age
av
she
half
the
money
begad
you
would
and
leap
at
it
perhaps
i
would
i
a
deal
sooner
have
a
woman
eighty
than
forty
there
be
some
chance
then
of
having
the
money
after
the
throuble
was
over
anty
neither
ould
enough
nor
young
enough
she
not
forty
any
way
and
wo
be
yet
for
five
years
and
more
and
as
i
hope
for
glory
john
though
i
know
you
wo
believe
me
i
would
marry
her
av
she
all
sim
lynch
property
instead
of
only
half
av
i
was
really
fond
of
her
and
av
i
think
i
make
her
a
good
husband
you
did
tell
mother
what
you
afther
did
you
sorrow
a
word
but
she
so
she
partly
guesses
and
i
think
meg
let
slip
something
the
girls
and
anty
are
thick
as
thiefs
since
old
sim
died
though
they
could
be
at
the
house
much
since
barry
came
home
and
anty
dare
for
her
life
come
down
to
the
shop
did
mother
say
anything
about
the
schame
faix
not
much
but
what
she
did
say
did
show
she
much
mind
for
it
since
sim
lynch
tried
to
get
toneroe
from
her
when
father
died
she
never
a
good
word
for
any
of
them
not
but
what
she
always
a
civil
look
for
anty
when
she
sees
her
there
not
much
fear
she
look
black
on
the
wife
when
you
bring
the
money
home
with
her
but
where
you
live
martin
the
little
shop
at
dunmore
be
no
place
for
mrs
kelly
when
there
a
lady
of
the
name
with
of
her
own
then
john
and
that
what
i
do
know
i
build
up
the
ould
house
at
toneroe
some
of
the
themselves
lived
there
years
ago
i
believe
they
did
but
it
was
years
ago
and
very
many
years
ago
too
since
they
lived
there
why
you
have
to
pull
it
all
down
before
you
began
to
build
it
up
i
build
a
new
house
out
and
out
av
i
got
three
new
lifes
in
the
laise
i
do
that
and
the
lord
would
be
refusing
me

the
lord
martin

of
any
lord

you
with
of
your
own
give
up
toneroe

lynch

at
dunmore
afther
you
married
his
sisther

not
do
you
know
barry

of
the
raal
gentry

ways

yer
reverence
mr
tierney
never
mind
they
could
come
to
no
good
when
they
be
parsecuting
the
likes
of
you
bravo
tom
hurrah
for
tom
steele
such
and
such
like
were
the
exclamations
which
greeted
the
traversers
and
their
as
they
drew
up
to
the
front
of
the
four
courts
dan
was
in
the
lord
mayor
state
carriage
accompanied
by
that
high
official
and
came
up
to
stand
his
trial
for
conspiracy
and
sedition
in
just
such
a
manner
as
he
might
be
presumed
to
proceed
to
take
the
chair
at
some
popular
municipal
assembly
and
this
was
just
the
thing
qualified
to
please
those
who
were
on
his
own
side
and
mortify
the
feelings
of
the
party
so
bitterly
opposed
to
him
there
was
a
bravado
in
it
and
an
apparent
contempt
not
of
the
law
so
much
as
of
the
existing
authorities
of
the
law
which
was
well
qualified
to
have
this
double
effect
and
now
the
outer
doors
of
the
court
were
opened
and
the
crowd
at
least
as
many
as
were
able
to
effect
an
entrance
rushed
in
martin
and
john
kelly
were
among
those
nearest
to
the
door
and
in
reward
of
their
long
patience
got
sufficiently
into
the
body
of
the
court
to
be
in
a
position
to
see
when
standing
on
tiptoe
the
noses
of
three
of
the
four
judges
and
the
wigs
of
four
of
the
numerous
counsel
employed
the
court
was
so
filled
by
those
who
had
a
place
there
by
right
or
influence
enough
to
assume
that
they
had
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
obtain
a
more
favourable
situation
but
this
of
itself
was
a
great
deal
quite
sufficient
to
justify
martin
in
detailing
to
his
connaught
friends
every
particular
of
the
whole
trial
they
would
probably
be
able
to
hear
everything
they
could
positively
see
three
of
the
judges
and
if
those
two
big
policemen
with
high
hats
could
by
any
possibility
be
got
to
remove
themselves
it
was
very
probable
that
they
would
be
able
to
see
sheil
back
when
he
stood
up
john
soon
began
to
show
off
his
forensic
knowledge
he
gave
a
near
guess
at
the
names
of
the
four
counsel
whose
heads
were
visible
merely
from
the
different
shades
and
shapes
of
their
wigs
then
he
particularised
the
inferior
angels
of
that
busy
elysium
that
ford
that
gartlan
that
peirce
mahony
he
exclaimed
as
the
different
attorneys
for
the
traversers
furiously
busy
with
their
huge
bags
fidgetted
about
rapidly
or
stood
up
in
their
seats
telegraphing
others
in
different
parts
of
the
court
there
old
kemmis
as
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
crown
agent
he
the
boy
that
doctored
the
jury
list
fancy
a
jury
chosen
out
of
all
dublin
and
not
one
catholic
as
if
that
could
be
fair
and
then
he
named
the
different
judges
look
at
that

like
the
rest
of
here
john
was
obliged
to
give
over
the
instruction
of
his
brother
being
enjoined
so
to
do
by
one
of
the
policemen
in
his
front
who
enforced
his
commands
for
silence
with
a
backward
shove
of
his
wooden
truncheon
which
came
with
rather
unnecessary
violence
against
the
pit
of
john
stomach
the
fear
of
being
turned
out
made
him
for
the
nonce
refrain
from
that
vengeance
of
abuse
which
his
education
as
a
dublin
jackeen
well
qualified
him
to
inflict
but
he
put
down
the
man
face
in
his
retentive
memory
and
made
up
his
mind
to
pay
him
off
and
now
the
business
of
the
day
commenced
after
some
official
delays
and
arrangements
sheil
arose
and
began
his
speech
in
defence
of
john
it
would
be
out
of
place
here
to
give
either
his
words
or
his
arguments
besides
they
have
probably
before
this
been
read
by
all
who
would
care
to
read
them
when
he
commenced
his
voice
appeared
to
those
who
were
not
accustomed
to
hear
him
weak
piping
and
most
unfit
for
a
popular
orator
but
this
effect
was
soon
lost
in
the
elegance
of
his
language
and
the
energy
of
his
manner
and
before
he
had
been
ten
minutes
on
his
legs
the
disagreeable
tone
was
forgotten
though
it
was
sounding
in
the
eager
ears
of
every
one
in
the
court
his
speech
was
certainly
brilliant
effective
and
eloquent
but
it
satisfied
none
that
heard
him
though
it
pleased
all
it
was
neither
a
defence
of
the
general
conduct
and
politics
of
the
party
such
as
himself
attempted
in
his
own
case
nor
did
it
contain
a
chain
of
legal
arguments
to
prove
that
john
individually
had
not
been
guilty
of
conspiracy
such
as
others
of
the
counsel
employed
subsequently
in
favour
of
their
own
clients
sheil
speech
was
one
of
those
numerous
anomalies
with
which
this
singular
trial
was
crowded
and
which
together
showed
the
great
difficulty
of
coming
to
a
legal
decision
on
a
political
question
in
a
criminal
court
of
this
the
present
day
gave
two
specimens
which
will
not
be
forgotten
when
a
privy
councillor
a
member
of
a
former
government
whilst
defending
his
client
as
a
barrister
proposed
in
court
a
new
form
of
legislation
for
ireland
equally
distant
from
that
adopted
by
government
and
that
sought
to
be
established
by
him
whom
he
was
defending
and
when
the
traverser
on
his
trial
rejected
the
defence
of
his
counsel
and
declared
aloud
in
court
that
he
would
not
by
his
silence
appear
to
agree
in
the
suggestions
then
made
this
spirit
of
turning
the
court
into
a
political
debating
arena
extended
to
all
present
in
spite
of
the
vast
efforts
made
by
them
all
only
one
of
the
barristers
employed
has
added
much
to
his
legal
reputation
by
the
occasion
imputations
were
made
such
as
i
presume
were
never
before
uttered
by
one
lawyer
against
another
in
a
court
of
law
an
sent
a
challenge
from
his
very
seat
of
office
and
though
that
challenge
was
read
in
court
it
was
passed
over
by
four
judges
with
hardly
a
reprimand
if
any
seditious
speech
was
ever
made
by
that
which
he
made
in
his
defence
was
especially
so
and
he
was
without
check
allowed
to
use
his
position
as
a
traverser
at
the
bar
as
a
rostrum
from
which
to
fulminate
more
thoroughly
and
publicly
than
ever
those
doctrines
for
uttering
which
he
was
then
being
tried
and
to
crown
it
all
even
the
silent
dignity
of
the
bench
was
forgotten
and
the
lawyers
pleading
against
the
crown
were
unhappily
alluded
to
by
the
chief
justice
as
the
gentlemen
on
the
side
martin
and
john
patiently
and
enduringly
remained
standing
the
whole
day
till
four
and
then
the
latter
had
to
effect
his
escape
in
order
to
keep
an
appointment
which
he
had
made
to
meet
lord
ballindine
as
they
walked
along
the
quays
they
both
discussed
the
proceedings
of
the
day
and
both
expressed
themselves
positively
certain
of
the
result
of
the
trial
and
of
the
complete
triumph
of
and
his
party
to
these
pleasant
certainties
martin
added
his
conviction
that
repeal
must
soon
follow
so
decided
a
victory
and
that
the
hopes
of
ireland
would
be
realised
before
the
close
of
john
was
neither
so
sanguine
nor
so
enthusiastic
it
was
the
battle
rather
than
the
thing
battled
for
that
was
dear
to
him
the
strife
rather
than
the
result
he
felt
that
it
would
be
dull
times
in
dublin
when
they
should
have
no
usurping
government
to
abuse
no
saxon
parliament
to
upbraid
no
english
laws
to
ridicule
and
no
established
church
to
curse
the
only
thing
which
could
reconcile
him
to
immediate
repeal
would
be
the
probability
of
having
then
to
contend
for
the
election
of
an
irish
sovereign
and
the
possible
dear
delight
which
might
follow
of
ireland
going
to
war
with
england
in
a
national
and
becoming
manner
discussing
these
important
measures
they
reached
the
dublin
lodgings
and
martin
turned
in
to
wash
his
face
and
hands
and
put
on
clean
boots
before
he
presented
himself
to
his
landlord
and
patron
the
young
lord
ballindine
ii
the
two
heiresses
francis
john
mountmorris
lord
viscount
ballindine
was
years
of
age
when
he
came
into
possession
of
the
ballindine
property
and
succeeded
to
an
irish
peerage
as
the
third
viscount
and
he
is
now
at
this
time
of
trial
the
head
of
the
family
had
for
many
years
back
been
styled
the
and
had
enjoyed
much
more
local
influence
under
that
denomination
than
their
descendants
had
possessed
since
they
had
obtained
a
more
substantial
though
not
a
more
respected
title
the
had
possessed
large
tracts
of
not
very
good
land
chiefly
in
county
roscommon
but
partly
in
mayo
and
galway
their
property
had
extended
from
dunmore
nearly
to
roscommon
and
again
on
the
other
side
to
castlerea
and
ballyhaunis
but
this
had
been
in
their
palmy
days
long
long
ago
when
the
government
in
consideration
of
past
services
in
the
year
converted
the
into
viscount
ballindine
the
family
property
consisted
of
the
greater
portion
of
the
land
lying
between
the
villages
of
dunmore
and
ballindine
their
old
residence
which
the
peer
still
kept
up
was
called
kelly
court
and
is
situated
in
that
corner
of
county
roscommnon
which
runs
up
between
mayo
and
galway
the
first
lord
lived
long
enough
to
regret
his
change
of
title
and
to
lament
the
increased
expenditure
with
which
he
had
thought
it
necessary
to
accompany
his
more
elevated
rank
his
son
succeeded
and
showed
in
his
character
much
more
of
the
viscount
than
of
the
ancient
his
whole
long
life
was
passed
in
hovering
about
the
english
court
from
the
time
of
his
father
death
he
never
once
put
his
foot
in
ireland
he
had
been
appointed
at
different
times
from
his
youth
upwards
page
gentleman
in
waiting
usher
of
the
black
rod
deputy
groom
of
the
stole
chief
equerry
to
the
princess
royal
which
appointment
only
lasted
till
the
princess
was
five
years
old
lord
gold
stick
keeper
of
the
royal
robes
till
at
last
he
had
culminated
for
ten
halcyon
years
in
a
lord
of
the
bedchamber
in
the
latter
portion
of
his
life
he
had
grown
too
old
for
this
and
it
was
reported
at
ballindine
dunmore
and
kelly
court
with
how
much
truth
i
know
that
since
her
majesty
accession
he
had
been
joined
with
the
spinster
sister
of
a
scotch
marquis
and
an
antiquated
english
countess
in
the
custody
of
the
laces
belonging
to
the
queen
dowager
this
nobleman
publicly
useful
as
his
life
had
no
doubt
been
had
done
little
for
his
own
tenants
or
his
own
property
on
his
father
death
he
had
succeeded
to
about
three
thousand
and
he
left
about
one
and
he
would
have
spent
or
mortgaged
this
had
he
not
on
his
marriage
put
it
beyond
his
own
power
to
do
so
it
was
not
only
by
thriftless
extravagance
that
he
thus
destroyed
a
property
which
with
care
and
without
extortion
would
have
doubled
its
value
in
the
years
during
which
it
was
in
his
hands
but
he
had
been
afraid
to
come
to
ireland
and
had
been
duped
by
his
agent
when
he
came
to
the
title
simeon
lynch
had
been
recommended
to
him
as
a
fit
person
to
manage
his
property
and
look
after
his
interests
and
simeon
had
managed
it
well
in
that
manner
most
conducive
to
the
prosperity
of
the
person
he
loved
best
in
the
world
and
that
was
himself
when
large
tracts
of
land
fell
out
of
lease
sim
had
represented
that
tenants
could
not
be
found
that
the
land
was
not
worth
cultivating
that
the
country
was
in
a
state
which
prevented
the
possibility
of
letting
and
ultimately
put
himself
into
possession
with
a
lease
for
ever
at
a
rent
varying
from
half
a
crown
to
five
shillings
an
acre
the
courtier
lord
had
one
son
of
whom
he
made
a
soldier
but
who
never
rose
to
a
higher
rank
than
that
of
captain
about
a
dozen
years
before
the
date
of
my
story
the
honourable
captain
after
numerous
quarrels
with
the
right
honourable
lord
of
the
bedchamber
had
at
last
come
to
some
family
settlement
with
him
and
having
obtained
the
power
of
managing
the
property
himself
came
over
to
live
at
his
paternal
residence
of
kelly
court
a
very
sorry
kind
of
court
he
found
it
neglected
dirty
and
out
of
repair
one
of
the
first
retainers
whom
he
met
was
jack
kelly
the
family
fool
jack
was
not
such
a
fool
as
those
who
of
yore
were
valued
appendages
to
noble
english
establishments
he
resembled
them
in
nothing
but
his
occasional
wit
he
was
a
dirty
barefooted
unshorn
ragged
ruffian
who
ate
potatoes
in
the
kitchen
of
the
court
and
had
never
done
a
day
work
in
his
life
such
as
he
was
however
he
was
presented
to
captain
as
his
honour
the
masther
fool
so
you
my
fool
jack
are
ye
said
the
captain
faix
i
war
the
lord
fool
ance
but
i
no
be
anybody
fool
but
sim
lynch
now
i
and
the
lord
are
both
sim
fools
now
not
but
the
first
of
the
two
for
i
never
be
fool
enough
to
give
away
all
my
land
av
my
father
been
wise
enough
to
lave
me
any
captain
soon
found
out
the
manner
in
which
the
agent
had
managed
his
father
affairs
simeon
lynch
was
dismissed
and
proceedings
at
common
law
were
taken
against
him
to
break
such
of
the
leases
as
were
thought
by
clever
attorneys
to
have
the
ghost
of
a
flaw
in
them
money
was
borrowed
from
a
dublin
house
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
on
the
suit
paying
off
debts
and
making
kelly
court
habitable
and
the
estate
was
put
into
their
hands
simeon
lynch
built
himself
a
large
staring
house
at
dunmore
defended
his
leases
set
up
for
a
country
gentleman
on
his
own
account
and
sent
his
only
son
barry
to
eton
merely
because
young
was
also
there
and
he
was
determined
to
show
that
he
was
as
rich
and
ambitious
as
the
family
whom
he
had
done
so
much
to
ruin
kelly
court
was
restored
to
such
respectability
as
could
ever
belong
to
so
ugly
a
place
it
was
a
large
red
stone
mansion
standing
in
a
demesne
of
very
poor
ground
ungifted
by
nature
with
any
beauty
and
but
little
assisted
by
cultivation
or
improvement
a
belt
of
firs
ran
round
the
demesne
inside
the
dilapidated
wall
but
this
was
hardly
sufficient
to
relieve
the
barren
aspect
of
the
locality
fine
trees
there
were
none
and
the
race
of
had
never
been
great
gardeners
captain
was
a
man
of
more
practical
sense
or
of
better
education
than
most
of
his
family
and
he
did
do
a
good
deal
to
humanise
the
place
he
planted
tilled
manured
and
improved
he
imported
and
and
civilised
kelly
court
a
little
but
his
reign
was
not
long
he
died
about
five
years
after
he
had
begun
his
career
as
a
country
gentleman
leaving
a
widow
and
two
daughters
in
ireland
a
son
at
school
at
eton
and
an
expensive
lawsuit
with
numerous
ramifications
all
unsettled
francis
the
son
went
to
eton
and
oxford
was
presented
at
court
by
his
grandfather
and
came
hack
to
ireland
at
to
idle
away
his
time
till
the
old
lord
should
die
till
this
occurred
he
could
neither
call
himself
the
master
of
the
place
nor
touch
the
rents
in
the
meantime
the
lawsuits
were
dropped
both
parties
having
seriously
injured
their
resources
without
either
of
them
obtaining
any
benefit
barry
lynch
was
recalled
from
his
english
education
where
he
had
not
shown
off
to
any
great
credit
and
both
he
and
his
father
were
obliged
to
sit
down
prepared
to
make
the
best
show
they
could
on
eight
hundred
pounds
and
to
wage
an
underhand
internecine
war
with
the
simeon
and
his
son
however
did
not
live
altogether
alone
anastasia
lynch
was
barry
sister
and
older
than
him
by
about
ten
years
their
mother
had
been
a
roman
catholic
whereas
sim
was
a
protestant
and
in
consequence
the
daughter
had
been
brought
up
in
the
mother
and
the
son
in
the
father
religion
when
this
mother
died
simeon
no
doubt
out
of
respect
to
the
memory
of
the
departed
tried
hard
to
induce
his
daughter
to
prove
her
religious
zeal
and
enter
a
nunnery
but
this
anty
though
in
most
things
a
docile
creature
absolutely
refused
to
do
her
father
advised
implored
and
threatened
but
in
vain
and
the
poor
girl
became
a
great
thorn
in
the
side
of
both
father
and
son
she
had
neither
beauty
talent
nor
attraction
to
get
her
a
husband
and
her
father
was
determined
not
to
encumber
his
already
diminished
property
with
such
a
fortune
as
would
make
her
on
that
ground
acceptable
to
any
respectable
suitor
poor
anty
led
a
miserable
life
associating
neither
with
superiors
nor
inferiors
and
her
own
position
was
not
sufficiently
declared
to
enable
her
to
have
any
equals
she
was
slighted
by
her
father
and
the
servants
and
bullied
by
her
brother
and
was
only
just
enabled
by
humble
unpresuming
disposition
to
carry
on
her
tedious
life
from
year
to
year
without
grumbling
in
the
meantime
the
black
rod
gold
stick
royal
equerry
and
lord
of
the
bedchamber
was
called
away
from
his
robes
and
his
finery
to
give
an
account
of
the
manner
in
which
he
had
renounced
the
pomps
and
vanities
of
this
wicked
world
and
frank
became
lord
ballindine
with
as
i
have
before
said
an
honourable
mother
two
sisters
a
large
red
house
and
a
thousand
he
was
not
at
all
a
man
after
the
pattern
of
his
grandfather
but
he
appeared
as
little
likely
to
redeem
the
old
family
acres
he
seemed
to
be
a
reviving
chip
of
the
old
block
of
the
during
the
two
years
he
had
been
living

won
the
hearts
of
all
the
tenants
of
all
those
who
would
have
been
tenants
if
the
property
had
not

still

up

footnote
french
former
previous
this
was
a
great
comfort
to
the
neighbourhood
which
had
learned
heartily
to
despise
the
name
of
lord
ballindine
and
frank
was
encouraged
in
shooting
hunting
racing
in
preparing
to
be
a
thorough
irish
gentleman
and
in
determining
to
make
good
the
prophecies
of
his
friends
that
he
would
be
at
last
one
more
raal
to
brighten
the
counthry
and
if
he
could
have
continued
to
be
frank
or
even
the
he
would
probably
have
done
well
enough
for
he
was
fond
of
his
mother
and
sisters
and
he
might
have
continued
to
hunt
shoot
and
farm
on
his
remaining
property
without
further
encroaching
on
it
but
the
title
was
sure
to
be
his
ruin
when
he
felt
himself
to
be
a
lord
he
could
not
be
content
with
the
simple
life
of
a
country
gentleman
or
at
any
rate
without
taking
the
lead
in
the
country
so
as
soon
as
the
old
man
was
buried
he
bought
a
pack
of
harriers
and
despatched
a
couple
of
to
the
skilful
hands
of
old
jack
igoe
the
curragh
trainer
frank
was
a
very
handsome
fellow
full
six
feet
high
with
black
hair
and
silky
whiskers
meeting
under
his
chin
the
men
said
he
dyed
them
and
the
women
declared
he
did
not
i
am
inclined
myself
to
think
he
must
have
done
so
they
were
so
very
black
he
had
an
eye
like
a
hawk
round
bright
and
bold
a
mouth
and
chin
almost
too
well
formed
for
a
man
and
that
kind
of
broad
forehead
which
conveys
rather
the
idea
of
a
generous
kind
disposition
than
of
a
deep
mind
or
a
commanding
intellect
frank
was
a
very
handsome
fellow
and
he
knew
it
and
when
he
commenced
so
many
expenses
immediately
on
his
grandfather
death
he
consoled
himself
with
the
idea
that
with
his
person
and
rank
he
would
soon
be
able
by
some
happy
matrimonial
speculation
to
make
up
for
what
he
wanted
in
wealth
and
he
had
not
been
long
his
own
master
before
he
met
with
the
lady
to
whom
he
destined
the
honour
of
doing
so
he
had
however
not
properly
considered
his
own
disposition
when
he
determined
upon
looking
out
for
great
wealth
and
on
disregarding
other
qualifications
in
his
bride
so
that
he
obtained
that
in
sufficient
quantity
he
absolutely
fell
in
love
with
fanny
wyndham
though
her
twenty
thousand
pounds
was
felt
by
him
to
be
hardly
enough
to
excuse
him
in
doing
so
certainly
not
enough
to
make
his
doing
so
an
accomplishment
of
his
prudential
resolutions
what
would
twenty
thousand
pounds
do
towards
clearing
the
property
and
establishing
himself
in
a
manner
and
style
fitting
for
a
lord
ballindine
however
he
did
propose
to
her
was
accepted
and
the
match
after
many
difficulties
was
acceded
to
by
the
lady
guardian
the
earl
of
cashel
it
was
stipulated
however
that
the
marriage
should
not
take
place
till
the
lady
was
of
age
and
at
the
time
of
the
bargain
she
wanted
twelve
months
of
that
period
of
universal
discretion
lord
cashel
had
added
in
his
prosy
sensible
aristocratic
lecture
on
the
subject
to
lord
ballindine
that
he
trusted
that
during
the
interval
considering
their
united
limited
income
his
lordship
would
see
the
wisdom
of
giving
up
his
hounds
or
at
any
rate
of
withdrawing
from
the
turf
frank
at
the
hounds
said
that
horses
cost
nothing
in
connaught
and
dogs
less
and
that
he
could
not
well
do
there
without
them
but
promised
to
turn
in
his
mind
what
lord
cashel
had
said
about
the
turf
and
at
last
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
when
a
good
opportunity
offered
of
backing
out
he
would
part
with
finn
and
granuell
as
the
two
nags
at
igoe
were
patriotically
denominated
they
continued
however
appearing
in
the
curragh
lists
in
lord
ballindine
name
as
a
part
of
igoe
string
and
running
for
whips
wellingtons
and
madrids
sometimes
with
good
and
sometimes
with
indifferent
success
while
their
noble
owner
when
staying
at
grey
abbey
lord
cashel
magnificent
seat
near
kilcullen
spent
too
much
of
his
time
at
least
so
thought
the
earl
and
fanny
wyndham
in
seeing
them
get
their
gallops
and
in
lecturing
the
grooms
and
being
lectured
by
mr
igoe
nothing
more
however
could
be
done
and
it
was
trusted
that
when
the
day
of
the
wedding
should
come
he
would
be
found
minus
the
animals
what
however
was
lord
cashel
surprise
when
after
an
absence
of
two
months
from
grey
abbey
lord
ballindine
declared
in
the
earl
presence
with
an
air
of
carelessness
that
he
had
been
elected
one
of
the
stewards
of
the
curragh
in
the
room
of
walter
blake
who
had
retired
in
rotation
from
that
honourable
office
the
next
morning
the
earl
chagrin
was
woefully
increased
by
his
hearing
that
that
very
valuable
and
promising
derby
colt
brien
boru
now
two
years
old
by
sir
hercules
out
of
eloisa
had
been
added
to
his
lordship
lot
lord
cashel
felt
that
he
could
not
interfere
further
than
by
remarking
that
it
appeared
his
young
friend
was
determined
to
leave
the
turf
with
éclat
and
fanny
wyndham
could
only
be
silent
and
reserved
for
one
evening
this
occurred
about
four
months
before
the
commencement
of
my
tale
and
about
five
before
the
period
fixed
for
the
marriage
but
at
the
time
at
which
lord
ballindine
will
be
introduced
in
person
to
the
reader
he
had
certainly
made
no
improvement
in
his
manner
of
going
on
he
had
during
this
period
received
from
lord
cashel
a
letter
intimating
to
him
that
his
lordship
thought
some
further
postponement
advisable
that
it
was
as
well
not
to
fix
any
day
and
that
though
his
lordship
would
always
be
welcome
at
grey
abbey
when
his
personal
attendance
was
not
required
at
the
curragh
it
was
better
that
no
correspondence
by
letter
should
at
present
be
carried
on
between
him
and
miss
wyndham
and
that
miss
wyndham
herself
perfectly
agreed
in
the
propriety
of
these
suggestions
now
grey
abbey
was
only
about
eight
miles
distant
from
the
curragh
and
lord
ballindine
had
at
one
time
been
in
the
habit
of
staying
at
his
friend
mansion
during
the
period
of
his
attendance
at
the
but
since
lord
cashel
had
shown
an
entire
absence
of
interest
in
the
doings
of
finn
and
fanny
had
ceased
to
ask
after
granuell
cough
he
had
discontinued
doing
so
and
had
spent
much
of
his
time
at
his
friend
walter
blake
residence
at
the
curragh
now
handicap
lodge
offered
much
more
dangerous
quarters
for
him
than
did
grey
abbey
in
the
meantime
his
friends
in
connaught
were
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
his
bringing
home
a
bride
fanny
twenty
thousand
were
magnified
to
fifty
and
the
capabilities
even
of
fifty
were
greatly
exaggerated
besides
the
connection
was
so
good
a
one
so
exactly
the
thing
for
the
lord
cashel
was
one
of
the
first
resident
noblemen
in
ireland
a
representative
peer
a
wealthy
man
and
possessed
of
great
influence
not
unlikely
to
be
a
cabinet
minister
if
the
whigs
came
in
and
able
to
shower
down
into
connaught
a
degree
of
patronage
such
as
had
never
yet
warmed
that
poor
unfriended
region
and
fanny
wyndham
was
not
only
his
lordship
ward
but
his
favourite
niece
also
the
match
was
in
every
way
a
good
one
and
greatly
pleasing
to
all
the
kellys
whether
with
an
o
or
without
for
shure
they
were
all
the
one
family
old
simeon
lynch
and
his
son
barry
did
not
participate
in
the
general
joy
they
had
calculated
that
their
neighbour
was
on
the
high
road
to
ruin
and
that
he
would
soon
have
nothing
but
his
coronet
left
they
could
not
therefore
bear
the
idea
of
his
making
so
eligible
a
match
they
had
moreover
had
domestic
dissensions
to
disturb
the
peace
of
dunmore
house
simeon
had
insisted
on
barry
taking
a
farm
into
his
own
hands
and
looking
after
it
barry
had
declared
his
inability
to
do
so
and
had
nearly
petrified
the
old
man
by
expressing
a
wish
to
go
to
paris
then
barry
debts
had
showered
in
and
simeon
had
pledged
himself
not
to
pay
them
simeon
had
threatened
to
disinherit
barry
and
barry
had
called
his
father
a
d
d
obstinate
old
fool
these
quarrels
had
got
to
the
ears
of
the
neighbours
and
it
was
being
calculated
that
in
the
end
barry
would
get
the
best
of
the
battle
when
one
morning
the
war
was
brought
to
an
end
by
a
fit
of
apoplexy
and
the
old
man
was
found
dead
in
his
chair
and
then
a
terrible
blow
fell
upon
the
son
for
a
recent
will
was
found
in
the
old
man
desk
dividing
his
property
equally
and
without
any
other
specification
between
barry
and
anty
this
was
a
dreadful
blow
to
barry
he
consulted
with
his
friend
molloy
the
attorney
of
tuam
as
to
the
validity
of
the
document
and
the
power
of
breaking
it
but
in
vain
it
was
properly
attested
though
drawn
up
in
the
old
man
own
and
his
sister
whom
he
looked
upon
but
as
little
better
than
a
head
had
not
only
an
equal
right
to
all
the
property
but
was
equally
mistress
of
the
house
the
money
at
the
bank
the
wine
in
the
cellar
and
the
very
horses
in
the
stable
this
was
a
hard
blow
but
barry
was
obliged
to
bear
it
at
first
he
showed
his
plainly
enough
in
his
treatment
of
his
sister
but
he
soon
saw
that
this
was
folly
and
that
though
her
quiet
disposition
prevented
her
from
resenting
it
such
conduct
would
drive
her
to
marry
some
needy
man
then
he
began
with
an
ill
grace
to
try
what
coaxing
would
do
he
kept
however
a
sharp
watch
on
all
her
actions
and
on
once
hearing
that
in
his
absence
the
two
kelly
girls
from
the
hotel
had
been
seen
walking
with
her
he
gave
her
a
long
lecture
on
what
was
due
to
her
own
dignity
and
the
memory
of
her
departed
parents
he
made
many
overtures
to
her
as
to
the
division
of
the
property
but
easy
and
humble
as
anty
was
she
was
careful
enough
to
put
her
name
to
nothing
that
could
injure
her
rights
they
had
divided
the
money
at
the
banker
and
she
had
once
rather
startled
barry
by
asking
him
for
his
moiety
towards
paying
the
butcher
bill
and
his
dismay
was
completed
shortly
afterwards
by
being
informed
by
a
steady
old
gentleman
in
dunmore
whom
he
did
not
like
a
bit
too
well
that
he
had
been
appointed
by
miss
lynch
to
manage
her
business
and
receive
her
rents
as
soon
as
it
could
be
decently
done
after
his
father
burial
barry
took
himself
off
to
dublin
to
consult
his
friends
there
as
to
what
he
should
do
but
he
soon
returned
determined
to
put
a
bold
face
on
it
and
come
to
some
understanding
with
his
sister
he
first
proposed
to
her
to
go
and
live
in
dublin
but
she
said
she
preferred
dunmore
he
then
talked
of
selling
the
house
and
to
this
she
agreed
he
next
tried
to
borrow
money
for
the
payment
of
his
debts
on
which
she
referred
him
to
the
steady
old
man
though
apparently
docile
and
obedient
she
would
not
put
herself
in
his
hands
nor
would
her
agent
allow
him
to
take
any
unfair
advantage
of
her
whilst
this
was
going
on
our
friend
martin
kelly
had
set
his
eye
upon
the
prize
and
by
means
of
his
sister
intimacy
with
anty
and
his
own
good
looks
had
succeeded
in
obtaining
from
her
half
a
promise
to
become
his
wife
anty
had
but
little
innate
respect
for
gentry
and
though
she
feared
her
brother
displeasure
she
felt
no
degradation
at
the
idea
of
uniting
herself
to
a
man
in
martin
kelly
rank
she
could
not
however
be
brought
to
tell
her
brother
openly
and
declare
her
determination
and
martin
had
at
length
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
must
carry
her
off
before
delay
and
unforeseen
changes
might
either
alter
her
mind
or
enable
her
brother
to
entice
her
out
of
the
country
thus
matters
stood
at
dunmore
when
martin
kelly
started
for
dublin
and
at
the
time
when
he
was
about
to
wait
on
his
patron
at
hotel
both
martin
and
lord
ballindine
and
they
were
related
in
some
distant
degree
at
least
so
always
said
the
kellys
and
i
never
knew
that
the
denied
it
both
the
young
men
were
at
the
time
anxious
to
get
married
and
both
with
the
same
somewhat
mercenary
views
and
i
have
fatigued
the
reader
with
the
long
history
of
past
affairs
in
order
to
imbue
him
if
possible
with
some
interest
in
the
ways
and
means
which
they
both
adopted
to
accomplish
their
objects
iii
morrison
hotel
at
about
five
on
the
evening
of
the
day
of
sheil
speech
lord
ballindine
and
his
friend
walter
blake
were
lounging
on
different
sofas
in
a
room
at
morrison
hotel
before
they
went
up
to
dress
for
dinner
walter
blake
was
an
man
about
thirty
or
years
of
age
good
looking
and
gentlemanlike
but
presenting
quite
a
contrast
in
his
appearance
to
his
friend
lord
ballindine
he
had
a
cold
quiet
grey
eye
and
a
thin
lip
and
though
he
was
in
reality
a
much
cleverer
he
was
a
much
less
engaging
man
yet
blake
could
be
very
amusing
but
he
rather
laughed
at
people
than
with
them
and
when
there
were
more
than
two
in
company
he
would
usually
be
found
making
a
butt
of
one
nevertheless
his
society
was
greatly
sought
after
on
matters
connected
with
racing
his
word
was
infallible
he
rode
boldly
and
always
rode
good
horses
and
though
he
was
anything
but
rich
he
managed
to
keep
up
a
comfortable
snuggery
at
the
curragh
and
to
drink
the
very
best
claret
that
dublin
could
procure
walter
blake
was
a
finished
gambler
and
thus
it
was
that
with
about
six
hundred
a
year
he
managed
to
live
on
equal
terms
with
the
richest
around
him
his
father
laurence
blake
of
castleblakeney
in
county
galway
was
a
very
embarrassed
man
of
good
property
strictly
entailed
and
when
walter
came
of
age
he
and
his
father
who
could
never
be
happy
in
the
same
house
though
possessing
in
most
things
similar
tastes
had
made
such
a
disposition
of
the
estate
as
gave
the
father
a
clear
though
narrowed
income
and
enabled
the
son
at
once
to
start
into
the
world
without
waiting
for
his
father
death
though
by
so
doing
he
greatly
lessened
the
property
which
he
must
otherwise
have
inherited
blake
was
a
thorough
gambler
and
knew
well
how
to
make
the
most
of
the
numerous
chances
which
the
turf
afforded
him
he
had
a
large
stud
of
horses
to
the
training
and
working
of
which
he
attended
almost
as
closely
as
the
person
whom
he
paid
for
doing
so
but
it
was
in
the
that
he
was
most
formidable
it
was
said
in
kildare
street
that
no
one
at
tattersall
could
beat
him
at
a
book
he
had
latterly
been
trying
a
wider
field
than
the
curragh
supplied
him
and
had
on
one
or
two
occasions
run
a
horse
in
england
with
such
success
as
had
placed
him
at
any
rate
quite
at
the
top
of
the
irish
sporting
tree
he
was
commonly
called
dot
blake
in
consequence
of
his
having
told
one
of
his
friends
that
the
cause
of
his
the
friend
losing
so
much
money
on
the
turf
was
that
he
did
not
mind
the
dot
and
carry
on
part
of
the
business
meaning
thereby
that
he
did
not
attend
to
the
necessary
calculations
for
a
short
time
after
giving
this
piece
of
friendly
caution
he
had
been
dot
and
carry
on
but
that
was
too
long
to
last
and
he
had
now
for
some
years
been
known
to
every
sporting
man
in
ireland
as
dot
blake
this
man
was
at
present
lord
ballindine
most
intimate
friend
and
he
could
hardly
have
selected
a
more
dangerous
one
they
were
now
going
down
together
to
handicap
lodge
though
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
in
the
way
of
racing
for
months
to
come
yet
blake
knew
his
business
too
well
to
suppose
that
his
presence
was
necessary
only
when
the
horses
were
running
and
he
easily
persuaded
his
friend
that
it
was
equally
important
that
he
should
go
and
see
that
it
was
all
right
with
the
derby
colt
they
were
talking
almost
in
the
dark
on
these
topics
when
the
waiter
knocked
at
the
door
and
informed
them
that
a
young
man
named
kelly
wished
to
see
lord
ballindine
show
him
up
said
frank
a
tenant
of
mine
dot
one
of
the
respectable
few
of
that
cattle
indeed
almost
the
only
one
that
got
a
sort
of
subagent
and
a
fifteenth
cousin
to
boot
i
believe
i
am
going
to
put
him
to
the
best
use
i
know
for
such
respectable
fellows
and
that
is
to
get
him
to
borrow
money
for
me
and
he
charge
you
twice
as
much
for
it
and
make
three
times
as
much
bother
about
it
as
the
fellows
in
the
next
street
who
have
your
when
i
want
lawyer
business
done
i
go
to
a
lawyer
and
when
i
want
to
borrow
money
i
go
to
my
own
man
of
business
he
makes
it
his
business
to
find
money
and
he
dare
rob
me
more
than
is
decent
fitting
and
customary
because
he
has
a
character
to
lose
those
fellows
at
guinness
make
such
a
fuss
about
everything
and
i
do
put
my
nose
into
that
little
back
room
but
what
every
word
i
say
by
some
means
or
other
finds
its
way
down
to
grey
abbey
well
frank
you
know
your
own
affairs
best
but
i
do
think
make
money
by
being
afraid
of
your
agent
or
your
wife
guardian
if
she
is
to
be
your
wife
afraid
man
i
as
much
afraid
of
lord
cashel
as
you
are
i
think
i
shown
myself
much
afraid
but
i
do
choose
to
make
him
my
guardian
just
when
he
ceasing
to
be
hers
nor
do
i
wish
just
now
to
break
with
grey
abbey
altogether
do
you
mean
to
go
over
there
from
the
curragh
next
week
i
do
think
i
shall
they
do
like
me
a
bit
too
well
when
the
smell
of
the
stables
on
me
there
it
is
again
frank
what
is
it
to
you
what
lord
cashel
likes
if
you
wish
to
see
miss
wyndham
and
if
the
old
don
mean
to
close
his
doors
against
you
what
business
has
he
to
inquire
where
you
came
from
i
suppose
he
does
like
me
a
bit
too
well
but
you
not
weak
enough
to
be
afraid
to
say
that
you
been
at
handicap
lodge
the
truth
is
dot
i
do
think
i
go
to
grey
abbey
at
all
till
fanny
of
age
she
only
wants
a
month
of
it
now
and
then
i
can
meet
lord
cashel
in
a
business
way
as
one
man
should
meet
another
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
said
blake
make
out
what
it
is
that
has
set
that
old
fellow
so
strong
against
horses
he
won
the
oaks
twice
himself
and
that
not
so
very
long
ago
and
his
own
son
kilcullen
is
deeper
a
good
deal
on
the
turf
than
i
am
and
by
a
long
chalk
less
likely
to
pull
through
as
i
take
it
but
here
the
connaught
man
on
the
stairs
i
could
swear
to
galway
by
the
tread
of
his
foot
and
martin
knocked
at
the
door
and
walked
in
well
kelly
said
lord
ballindine
how
does
dublin
agree
with
you
and
i
hope
i
see
your
lordship
well
my
lord
said
martin
how
are
they
all
at
dunmore
and
kelly
court
why
thin
they
all
well
my
lord
except
sim
lynch
and
he
dead
but
your
lordship
have
heard
that
what
old
simeon
lynch
dead
said
blake
well
then
promotion
peter
mahon
that
was
the
agent
at
castleblakeney
is
now
the
biggest
rogue
alive
in
connaught
do
swear
to
that
said
lord
ballindine
there
some
of
breed
still
left
at
dunmore
it
would
be
easy
to
beat
barry
would
it
kelly
why
then
i
do
know
i
would
like
to
be
saying
against
the
gentleman
friend
that
he
spoke
of
and
doubtless
his
honour
knows
him
well
or
he
would
say
so
much
of
him
indeed
i
do
said
blake
i
never
give
a
man
a
good
character
till
i
know
he
deserves
it
well
frank
i
go
and
dress
and
leave
you
and
kelly
to
your
business
and
he
left
the
room
i
sorry
to
hear
you
speak
so
hard
agin
barry
my
lord
began
martin
he
may
be
so
bad
not
but
that
he
a
piece
of
timber
to
dale
with
and
why
should
you
be
sorry
i
speak
against
him
there
not
more
friendship
i
suppose
between
you
and
barry
lynch
now
than
there
used
to
be
why
not
exactly
frindship
my
lord
but
i
my
rasons
why
i
wish
you
not
to
belittle
the
lynches
your
lordship
might
forgive
them
all
now
the
old
man
dead
forgive
them
indeed
i
can
and
easily
i
do
know
i
ever
did
any
of
them
an
injury
except
when
i
thrashed
barry
at
eton
for
calling
himself
the
son
of
a
gentleman
but
what
makes
you
stick
up
for
them
you
not
going
to
marry
the
daughter
are
you
martin
blushed
up
to
his
forehead
as
his
landlord
thus
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
but
as
it
was
dark
his
blushes
could
be
seen
so
after
dangling
his
hat
about
for
a
minute
and
standing
first
on
one
foot
and
then
on
the
other
he
took
courage
and
answered
well
frank
that
is
your
lordship
i
mane
i
i
might
do
worse
body
and
soul
man
exclaimed
the
other
jumping
from
his
recumbent
position
on
the
sofa
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
you
going
to
marry
anty
lynch
in
course
not
answered
martin
av
your
lordship
objects
object
man
how
the
devil
can
i
object
why
she
six
hundred
a
year
has
she
about
four
my
lord
i
think
nearest
the
mark
four
hundred
a
year
and
i
do
suppose
you
owe
a
penny
in
the
world
not
much
unless
the
last
gale
to
your
lordship
and
we
never
pay
that
till
next
may
footnote
gale
rent
payment
gale
day
was
the
day
on
which
rent
was
due
and
so
you
going
to
marry
anty
lynch
again
repeated
frank
as
though
he
could
bring
himself
to
realise
the
idea
and
now
martin
tell
me
all
about
it
how
the
devil
you
managed
it
when
it
to
come
off
and
how
you
and
barry
mean
to
hit
it
off
together
when
brothers
i
suppose
i
lose
a
good
tenant
any
way
not
av
i
a
good
one
you
wo
with
my
consent
my
lord
ah
but
it
be
anty
consent
now
you
know
she
may
like
toneroe
but
tell
me
all
about
it
what
put
it
into
your
head
why
my
lord
you
run
away
so
fast
one
ca
tell
you
anything
i
did
say
i
was
going
to
marry
her
at
laist
not
for
certain
i
only
said
i
might
do
worse
well
then
are
you
going
to
marry
her
or
rather
is
she
going
to
marry
you
or
is
she
not
why
i
do
know
i
tell
your
lordship
just
how
it
is
you
know
when
old
sim
died
my
lord
of
course
i
do
why
i
was
at
kelly
court
at
the
time
so
you
were
my
lord
i
was
forgetting
but
you
went
away
again
immediately
and
did
hear
how
barry
tried
to
come
round
his
sisther
when
he
heard
how
the
will
went
and
how
he
tried
to
break
the
will
and
to
chouse
her
out
of
the
money
why
this
is
the
very
man
you
would
let
me
call
a
rogue
a
minute
or
two
ago
ah
my
lord
that
was
just
before
sthrangers
besides
it
no
use
calling
one
own
people
bad
names
not
that
he
belongs
to
me
yet
and
never
will
but
between
you
and
i
he
is
a
rogue
and
his
father
son
every
inch
of
him
well
martin
i
remember
i
not
abuse
him
when
he
your
but
how
did
you
get
round
the
sister
that
the
question
well
my
lord
i
tell
you
you
know
there
was
always
a
kind
of
frindship
between
anty
and
the
girls
at
home
and
they
set
her
up
to
going
to
old
moylan
he
that
receives
the
rents
on
young
property
away
at
strype
moylan
uncle
to
flaherty
that
married
mother
sister
well
she
went
to
him
he
a
kind
of
office
at
dunmore
my
lord
oh
i
know
him
and
his
office
he
knows
the
value
of
a
name
at
the
back
of
a
bit
of
paper
as
well
as
any
one
he
does
my
lord
but
he
an
honest
old
fellow
is
moylan
and
manages
a
little
for
mother
oh
of
course
he
honest
martin
because
he
belongs
to
you
you
know
barry
to
be
an
honest
chap
then
and
that
what
he
niver
will
be
the
longest
day
he
lives
but
however
moylan
got
her
to
sign
all
the
papers
and
when
barry
was
out
he
went
and
took
an
inventhory
to
the
house
and
made
out
everything
square
and
right
and
you
may
be
sure
barry
have
to
get
up
very
before
he
come
round
him
well
after
a
little
the
ould
chap
came
to
me
one
morning
and
asked
me
all
manner
of
questions
whether
i
knew
anty
lynch
whether
we
did
used
to
be
great
friends
and
a
lot
more
i
never
minded
him
much
for
though
i
and
anty
used
to
speak
and
she
dhrank
tay
on
the
sly
with
us
two
or
three
times
before
her
father
death
i
never
thought
much
about
her
nor
would
now
martin
eh
if
it
was
for
the
old
man
will
in
course
i
would
my
lord
i
wo
be
denying
it
but
on
the
other
hand
i
would
marry
her
now
for
all
her
money
av
i
mane
to
trate
her
well
well
my
lord
after
beating
about
the
bush
for
a
long
time
the
ould
thief
popped
it
out
and
told
me
that
he
thought
anty
be
all
the
betther
for
a
husband
and
that
av
i
was
wanting
a
wife
he
i
might
suit
myself
now
well
i
thought
of
it
a
little
and
tould
him
i
take
the
hint
the
next
day
he
comes
to
me
again
all
the
way
down
to
toneroe
where
i
was
walking
the
big
by
myself
and
began
saying
that
as
he
was
anty
agent
of
course
he
would
see
her
wronged
right
moylan
says
i
as
i
mane
to
be
her
husband
i
wo
see
her
wronged
neither
but
says
he
mane
that
i
must
see
her
property
properly
settled
not
says
i
is
the
best
way
for
her
to
marry
and
then
you
know
no
one
can
schame
her
out
of
it
there
lots
of
them
schamers
about
now
says
i
thrue
for
you
says
he
they
not
far
to
look
for
and
that
was
thrue
too
my
lord
for
he
and
i
were
both
schaming
about
poor
anty
money
at
that
moment
says
he
afther
walking
on
a
little
quite
quiet
you
war
to
marry
her
i
made
up
my
mind
about
that
moylan
says
i
av
it
should
come
to
pass
that
you
do
marry
her
of
course
you
expect
to
have
the
money
settled
on
herself
course
i
would
when
i
die
says
i
but
says
he
once
would
it
be
enough
for
you
to
have
a
warm
roof
over
your
head
and
a
leg
of
mutton
on
the
table
every
day
and
no
work
to
do
for
it
and
so
my
lord
it
came
out
that
the
money
was
to
be
settled
on
herself
and
that
he
was
to
be
her
agent
well
martin
after
that
i
think
you
need
go
to
sim
lynch
or
barry
for
the
biggest
rogues
in
connaught
to
be
settling
the
poor
girl
money
between
you
that
way
well
but
listen
my
lord
i
gave
in
to
the
ould
man
that
is
i
made
no
objection
to
his
schame
but
i
was
determined
av
i
ever
did
marry
anty
lynch
that
i
would
be
agent
and
owner
too
myself
as
long
as
i
lived
though
in
course
it
was
but
right
that
they
should
settle
it
so
that
av
i
died
first
the
poor
crature
should
be
out
of
her
money
but
i
did
let
on
to
him
about
all
that
for
av
he
was
angered
the
ould
fool
might
perhaps
spoil
the
game
and
i
knew
av
anty
married
me
at
all
it
be
for
liking
and
av
iver
i
got
on
the
soft
side
of
her
i
soon
be
able
to
manage
matthers
as
i
plazed
and
ould
moylan
soon
find
his
best
game
be
to
go
asy
upon
my
soul
martin
i
think
you
seem
to
have
been
the
sharpest
rogue
of
the
two
is
there
an
honest
man
in
connaught
at
all
i
wonder
i
ca
say
rightly
just
at
present
my
lord
but
there
be
two
plaze
god
when
i
and
your
lordship
are
there
thank
ye
kelly
for
the
compliment
and
especially
for
the
good
company
but
let
me
hear
how
on
earth
you
ever
got
face
enough
to
go
up
and
ask
anty
lynch
to
marry
you
oh
a
little
soft
sawther
did
it
i
was
long
in
putting
my
on
her
when
i
once
began
well
my
lord
from
that
day
out
from
afther
moylan
visit
you
know
i
began
really
to
think
of
it
i
sure
the
ould
robber
meant
to
have
asked
for
a
wapping
sum
of
money
down
for
his
good
will
in
the
bargain
but
when
he
saw
me
he
got
afeard
he
was
another
honest
man
just
now
only
among
sthrangers
my
lord
i
he
a
cousin
of
your
own
and
i
would
like
to
spake
ill
of
the
blood
god
forbid
but
go
on
kelly
well
so
from
that
out
i
began
to
think
of
it
in
arnest
the
lord
forgive
me
but
my
first
thoughts
was
how
i
like
to
pull
down
barry
lynch
and
my
second
that
i
not
demane
myself
by
marrying
the
sisther
of
such
an
ruffian
and
that
it
would
become
me
to
live
on
the
money
that
been
got
by
chating
your
lordship
grandfather
my
lordship
grandfather
ought
to
have
looked
after
that
himself
if
those
are
all
your
scruples
they
need
stick
in
your
throat
much
i
said
as
much
as
that
to
myself
too
so
i
soon
went
to
work
i
was
rather
shy
about
it
at
first
but
the
girls
helped
me
they
put
it
into
her
head
i
think
before
i
mentioned
it
at
all
however
by
degrees
i
asked
her
plump
whether
she
any
mind
to
be
kelly
and
though
she
did
say
she
did
say
but
how
the
devil
man
did
you
manage
to
get
at
her
i
told
barry
watches
her
like
a
dragon
ever
since
he
read
his
father
will
he
could
watch
her
so
close
but
what
she
could
make
her
way
down
to
mother
shop
now
and
again
or
for
the
matter
of
that
but
what
i
could
make
my
way
up
to
the
house
that
true
for
what
need
she
mind
barry
now
she
may
marry
whom
she
pleases
and
need
tell
him
unless
she
likes
until
the
priest
has
his
book
ready
ah
my
lord
but
there
the
rub
she
is
afraid
of
barry
and
though
she
did
say
so
she
wo
agree
to
tell
him
or
to
let
me
tell
him
or
just
to
let
the
priest
walk
into
the
house
without
telling
him
she
fond
of
barry
though
for
the
life
of
me
i
ca
see
what
there
is
in
him
for
anybody
to
be
fond
of
he
and
his
father
led
her
the
divil
own
life
mewed
up
there
because
she
would
be
a
nun
but
still
is
both
fond
and
afraid
of
him
and
though
i
do
think
marry
anybody
else
at
laist
not
yet
awhile
i
do
think
she
ever
get
courage
to
marry
me
at
any
rate
not
in
the
ordinary
way
why
then
martin
you
must
do
something
extraordinary
i
suppose
that
just
it
my
lord
and
what
i
wanted
was
to
ask
your
lordship
advice
and
sanction
like
sanction
why
i
should
think
you
want
anybody
sanction
for
marrying
a
wife
with
four
hundred
but
if
that
anything
to
you
i
can
assure
you
i
approve
of
it
thank
you
my
lord
that
kind
to
tell
the
truth
continued
lord
ballindine
i
a
little
of
your
own
first
feeling
i
be
glad
of
it
if
it
were
only
for
the
rise
it
would
take
out
of
my
schoolfellow
barry
not
but
that
i
think
you
a
deal
too
good
to
be
his
and
you
know
kelly
or
ought
to
know
that
i
be
heartily
glad
of
anything
for
your
own
welfare
so
i
advise
you
to
hammer
away
while
the
iron
hot
as
the
saying
is
that
just
what
i
coming
to
what
your
lordship
advise
me
to
do
advise
you
why
you
must
know
best
yourself
how
the
matter
stands
talk
her
over
and
make
her
tell
barry
divil
a
tell
my
lord
in
her
she
would
do
it
in
a
month
of
sundays
then
do
you
tell
him
at
once
i
suppose
you
not
afraid
of
him
she
niver
come
to
the
scratch
av
i
did
he
bully
the
life
out
of
her
or
get
her
out
of
the
counthry
some
way
then
wait
till
his
back
turned
for
a
month
or
so
when
he
out
let
the
priest
walk
in
and
do
the
matter
quietly
that
way
well
i
thought
of
that
myself
my
lord
but
he
as
wary
as
a
weazel
and
i
afeard
he
smells
something
in
the
wind
there
that
blackguard
moylan
too
he
be
telling
barry
and
would
when
he
came
to
find
things
were
to
be
settled
as
he
intended
then
you
must
carry
her
off
and
marry
her
up
here
or
in
galway
or
down
in
connemara
or
over
at
liverpool
or
any
where
you
please
now
you
hit
it
my
lord
that
just
what
i
thinking
myself
unless
i
take
her
off
gretna
green
fashion
i
never
get
her
then
why
do
you
want
my
advice
if
you
made
up
your
mind
to
that
i
think
you
quite
right
and
what
more
i
think
you
ought
to
lose
no
time
in
doing
it
will
she
go
do
you
think
why
with
a
little
talking
i
think
she
will
then
what
are
you
losing
your
time
for
man
hurry
down
and
off
with
her
i
think
dublin
probably
your
best
ground
then
you
think
my
lord
i
betther
do
it
at
once
of
course
i
do
what
is
there
to
delay
you
why
you
see
my
lord
the
poor
girl
as
good
as
got
no
friends
and
i
would
like
it
to
be
thought
in
the
counthry
i
taken
her
at
a
disadvantage
it
thrue
enough
in
one
way
i
marrying
her
for
the
money
that
is
in
course
i
would
marry
her
without
it
and
i
tould
her
out
open
before
her
face
and
before
the
girls
that
av
ten
times
as
much
i
would
marry
her
unless
i
was
to
be
masther
as
long
as
i
lived
of
everything
in
my
own
house
like
another
man
and
i
think
she
liked
me
the
betther
for
it
but
for
all
that
i
like
to
catch
her
up
without
having
something
fair
done
by
the
property
the
lawyers
martin
can
manage
that
afterwards
when
she
once
mrs
kelly
you
can
do
what
you
like
about
the
fortune
that
thrue
my
lord
but
i
would
like
the
bad
name
i
get
through
the
counthry
av
i
whisked
her
off
without
letting
her
settle
anything
they
be
saying
i
robbed
her
whether
i
did
or
no
and
when
a
thing
once
said
it
difficult
to
unsay
it
the
like
of
me
my
lord
ca
do
things
like
you
noblemen
and
gentry
besides
never
forgive
me
they
think
down
there
that
poor
anty
simple
like
tho
she
cute
enough
av
they
knew
her
i
would
for
all
the
money
wish
it
should
be
said
that
martin
kelly
ran
off
with
a
fool
and
robbed
her
barry
be
making
her
out
a
dale
more
simple
than
she
is
and
altogether
my
lord
i
would
like
it
well
martin
perhaps
you
right
at
any
rate
you
on
the
right
side
what
is
it
then
you
think
of
doing
why
i
was
thinking
my
lord
av
i
could
get
some
lawyer
here
to
draw
up
a
deed
just
settling
all
anty
property
on
herself
when
i
die
and
on
her
children
av
she
has
any
so
that
i
could
spend
it
you
know
she
could
sign
it
and
so
could
i
before
we
started
and
then
i
feel
she
been
traited
as
well
as
tho
she
all
the
friends
in
connaught
to
her
back
and
a
great
deal
better
probably
well
martin
i
no
lawyer
but
i
should
think
there
not
be
much
difficulty
about
that
any
attorney
could
do
it
but
i
look
so
quare
my
lord
walking
into
a
sthranger
room
and
explaining
what
i
wanted
all
about
the
running
away
and
everything
to
be
sure
there
my
brother
john
people
they
attorneys
but
about
robberies
and
hanging
and
such
things
they
most
engaged
and
i
was
thinking
av
your
lordship
would
think
it
too
much
throuble
to
give
me
a
line
to
your
own
people
or
you
say
a
word
to
them
explaining
what
i
want
it
be
the
greatest
favour
in
life
i
tell
you
what
i
do
kelly
i
go
with
you
to
mr
blake
lawyers
that
my
friend
that
was
sitting
here
and
i
no
doubt
we
get
the
matter
settled
the
guinnesses
you
know
do
all
my
business
and
they
not
lawyers
long
life
to
your
lordship
and
that
just
like
yourself
i
knew
you
stick
by
me
and
shall
i
call
on
you
my
lord
and
at
what
time
wait
here
mr
blake
i
ask
him
and
you
might
as
well
meet
me
there
grey
and
forrest
the
name
it
in
clare
street
i
think
here
mr
blake
again
entered
the
room
what
said
he
is
your
business
over
yet
ballindine
i
suppose
i
then
only
mind
dinner
ordered
for
half
past
six
and
it
that
now
and
you
not
dressed
yet
you
not
and
i
was
just
wanting
you
we
all
friends
here
kelly
you
know
and
you
need
mind
my
telling
mr
blake
this
fellow
going
to
elope
with
an
heiress
from
connaught
and
he
wants
a
decently
honest
lawyer
first
i
should
have
thought
said
blake
that
an
indecently
dishonest
clergyman
would
have
suited
him
better
under
those
circumstances
he
want
that
too
and
i
no
doubt
you
can
recommend
one
but
at
present
he
wants
a
lawyer
and
as
i
have
none
of
my
own
i
think
forrest
would
serve
his
turn
i
always
found
mr
forrest
ready
to
do
anything
in
the
way
of
his
profession
for
money
no
but
he
draw
up
a
deed
would
he
blake
it
a
sort
of
a
marriage
settlement
oh
he
quite
at
home
at
that
work
he
drew
up
five
for
my
five
sisters
and
thereby
ruined
my
father
property
and
my
prospects
well
he
see
me
would
he
said
lord
ballindine
of
course
he
would
but
mind
we
to
be
off
early
we
ought
to
be
at
the
curragh
by
three
i
suppose
i
could
see
him
at
ten
said
his
lordship
it
was
then
settled
that
blake
should
write
a
line
to
the
lawyer
informing
him
that
lord
ballindine
wished
to
see
him
at
his
office
at
ten
the
next
morning
it
was
also
agreed
that
martin
should
meet
him
there
at
that
hour
and
kelly
took
his
leave
much
relieved
on
the
subject
nearest
his
heart
well
frank
said
blake
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
and
have
you
got
the
money
you
wanted
indeed
i
not
then
and
why
not
if
your
protégé
is
going
to
elope
with
an
heiress
he
ought
to
have
money
at
command
and
so
he
will
and
it
be
a
great
temptation
to
me
to
know
where
i
can
get
it
so
easily
but
he
was
telling
me
all
about
this
woman
before
i
thought
of
my
own
concerns
and
i
did
like
to
be
talking
to
him
of
what
i
wanted
myself
when
he
been
asking
a
favour
of
me
it
would
be
too
much
like
looking
for
payment
there
you
wrong
fair
barter
is
the
truest
and
honestest
system
all
the
world
me
ca
thee
as
the
scotch
call
it
is
the
best
system
to
go
by
i
never
do
or
ask
that
is
for
whatever
i
do
i
expect
a
return
and
for
whatever
i
get
i
intend
to
make
one
i
get
the
money
from
guinness
after
all
that
be
the
best
and
as
you
say
the
cheapest
there
you
right
his
business
is
to
lend
money
and
he
lend
it
you
as
long
as
you
means
to
repay
it
and
i
sure
no
connaught
man
will
do
more
that
is
if
i
know
them
i
suppose
he
will
but
heaven
only
knows
how
long
that
be
and
the
young
lord
threw
himself
back
on
the
sofa
as
if
he
thought
a
little
meditation
would
do
him
good
however
very
little
seemed
to
do
for
him
for
he
soon
roused
himself
and
said
i
wonder
how
the
devil
dot
you
do
without
borrowing
my
income
larger
than
yours
bad
as
it
is
i
only
three
horses
in
training
and
you
i
suppose
above
a
dozen
and
take
the
year
through
i
do
entertain
half
the
fellows
at
kelly
court
that
you
do
at
handicap
lodge
and
yet
i
never
hear
of
your
borrowing
money
there
many
reasons
for
that
in
the
first
place
i
have
an
estate
in
the
second
i
have
a
mother
in
the
third
i
have
a
pack
of
hounds
in
the
fourth
i
have
a
title
and
in
the
fifth
no
one
would
lend
me
money
if
i
asked
it
as
for
the
estate
it
devilish
little
i
spend
on
it
as
for
my
mother
she
has
her
own
jointure
as
for
the
hounds
they
eat
my
own
potatoes
and
as
for
the
title
i
do
support
it
but
i
have
your
luck
dot
you
never
want
for
money
though
the
mint
broke
very
likely
i
may
when
it
does
but
i
likely
to
be
poor
enough
till
that
happy
accident
occurs
but
as
far
as
luck
goes
you
had
more
than
me
you
won
nearly
as
much
in
stakes
as
i
did
last
autumn
and
your
stable
expenses
were
much
above
a
quarter
what
mine
were
but
the
truth
is
i
manage
better
i
know
where
my
money
goes
to
and
you
do
i
work
hard
and
you
do
i
spend
my
money
on
necessary
to
my
style
of
living
you
spend
yours
on
what
not
necessary
what
the
deuce
have
the
fellows
in
mayo
and
roscommon
done
for
you
that
you
should
mount
two
or
three
rascals
twice
to
show
them
sport
when
you
not
there
yourself
two
months
in
the
season
i
suppose
you
do
keep
the
horses
and
men
for
nothing
if
you
do
the
dogs
and
i
much
doubt
whether
they
not
the
dearest
part
of
the
bargain
of
course
they
cost
something
but
it
the
only
thing
i
can
do
for
the
country
and
there
were
always
hounds
at
kelly
court
till
my
grandfather
got
the
property
and
they
looked
upon
him
as
no
better
than
an
old
woman
because
he
gave
them
up
besides
i
suppose
i
shall
be
living
at
kelly
court
soon
altogether
and
i
could
never
get
on
then
without
hounds
it
bad
enough
as
it
is
i
have
a
doubt
in
the
world
it
bad
enough
i
know
what
castleblakeney
is
but
i
doubt
your
living
there
i
no
doubt
try
that
is
if
you
marry
miss
wyndham
but
she
be
sick
of
it
in
three
months
and
you
in
six
and
you
go
and
live
at
paris
florence
or
naples
and
there
be
another
end
of
the
for
thirty
or
forty
years
as
far
as
ireland
concerned
you
never
do
for
a
poor
country
lord
you
not
sufficiently
proud
or
stingy
you
do
very
well
as
a
country
gentleman
and
you
make
a
decent
nobleman
with
such
a
fortune
as
lord
cashel
but
your
game
if
you
lived
on
your
own
property
would
be
a
very
difficult
one
and
one
for
which
you
neither
tact
nor
temper
well
i
hope
i
never
live
out
of
ireland
though
i
may
have
tact
to
make
one
thousand
go
as
far
as
five
i
sense
enough
to
see
that
a
poor
absentee
landlord
is
a
great
curse
to
his
country
and
what
i
hope
i
never
shall
be
my
dear
lord
ballindine
all
poor
men
are
curses
to
themselves
or
some
one
else
a
poor
absentee
the
worst
of
all
he
leaves
nothing
behind
and
can
leave
nothing
he
wants
all
he
has
for
himself
and
if
he
does
give
his
neighbours
the
profit
which
must
arise
somewhere
from
his
own
consumption
he
can
give
nothing
a
rich
man
can
afford
to
leave
three
or
four
thousand
a
year
behind
him
in
the
way
of
wages
for
labour
my
gracious
frank
you
should
put
all
that
in
a
pamphlet
and
not
inflict
it
on
a
poor
devil
waiting
for
his
dinner
at
present
give
your
profit
to
morrison
and
come
and
consume
some
and
i
tell
you
what
sheil
going
to
do
for
us
all
lord
ballindine
did
as
he
was
bid
and
left
the
room
to
prepare
for
dinner
by
the
time
that
he
had
eaten
his
soup
and
drank
a
glass
of
wine
he
had
got
rid
of
the
fit
of
blue
devils
which
the
thoughts
of
his
poverty
had
brought
on
and
he
spent
the
rest
of
the
evening
comfortably
enough
listening
to
his
friend
comical
version
of
shell
speech
receiving
instruction
from
that
great
master
of
the
art
as
to
the
manner
in
which
he
should
treat
his
derby
colt
and
being
flattered
into
the
belief
that
he
would
be
a
prominent
favourite
for
that
great
race
when
they
had
finished
their
wine
they
sauntered
into
the
kildare
street
club
blake
was
soon
busy
with
his
little
and
lord
ballindine
followed
his
example
brien
boru
was
before
long
in
great
demand
blake
took
fifty
to
one
and
then
talked
the
horse
up
till
he
ended
by
giving
he
was
soon
ranked
the
first
of
the
irish
lot
and
the
success
of
the
hibernians
had
made
them
very
sanguine
of
late
lord
ballindine
found
himself
the
centre
of
a
little
sporting
circle
as
being
the
man
with
the
crack
nag
of
the
day
he
was
talked
of
courted
and
appealed
to
and
i
regret
to
say
that
before
he
left
the
club
he
was
again
nearly
forgetting
kelly
court
and
miss
wyndham
had
altogether
got
rid
of
his
patriotic
notions
as
to
the
propriety
of
living
on
his
own
estate
had
determined
forthwith
to
send
brien
boru
over
to
scott
english
stables
and
then
went
to
bed
and
dreamed
that
he
was
a
winner
of
the
derby
and
was
preparing
for
the
glories
of
newmarket
with
five
or
six
thousand
pounds
in
his
pocket
martin
kelly
dined
with
his
brother
at
jude
and
spent
his
evening
equally
unreasonably
at
least
it
may
be
supposed
so
from
the
fact
that
at
one
in
the
morning
he
was
to
be
seen
standing
on
one
of
the
tables
at
burton
bindon
with
a
pewter
pot
full
of
porter
in
his
hand
and
insisting
that
every
one
in
the
room
should
drink
the
health
of
anty
lynch
whom
on
that
occasion
he
swore
to
be
the
prettiest
and
the
youngest
girl
in
connaught
it
was
lucky
he
was
so
intoxicated
that
no
one
could
understand
him
and
that
his
hearers
were
so
drunk
that
they
could
understand
nothing
as
otherwise
the
publicity
of
his
admiration
might
have
had
the
effect
of
preventing
the
accomplishment
of
his
design
he
managed
however
to
meet
his
patron
the
next
morning
at
the
lawyer
though
his
eyes
were
very
red
and
his
cheeks
pale
and
after
being
there
for
some
half
hour
left
the
office
with
the
assurance
that
whenever
he
and
the
lady
might
please
to
call
there
they
should
find
a
deed
prepared
for
their
signature
which
would
adjust
the
property
in
the
manner
required
that
afternoon
lord
ballindine
left
dublin
with
his
friend
to
make
instant
arrangements
for
the
exportation
of
brien
boru
and
at
two
the
next
day
martin
left
by
the
boat
for
ballinaslie
having
evinced
his
patriotism
by
paying
a
year
subscription
in
advance
to
the
nation
newspaper
and
with
his
mind
fully
made
up
to
bring
anty
away
to
dublin
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
iv
the
dunmore
inn
anty
lynch
was
not
the
prettiest
or
the
youngest
girl
in
connaught
nor
would
martin
have
affirmed
her
to
be
so
unless
he
had
been
very
much
inebriated
indeed
however
young
she
might
have
been
once
she
was
never
pretty
but
in
all
ireland
there
was
not
a
more
young
woman
i
do
not
use
the
word
simple
as
foolish
for
though
uneducated
she
was
not
foolish
but
she
was
unaffected
honest
humble
and
true
entertaining
a
very
lowly
idea
of
her
own
value
and
unelated
by
her
newly
acquired
wealth
she
had
been
so
little
thought
of
all
her
life
by
others
that
she
had
never
learned
to
think
much
of
herself
she
had
had
but
few
acquaintances
and
no
friends
and
had
spent
her
life
hitherto
so
quietly
and
silently
that
her
apparent
apathy
was
attributable
rather
to
want
of
subjects
of
excitement
than
to
any
sluggishness
of
disposition
her
mother
had
died
early
and
since
then
the
only
case
in
which
anty
had
been
called
on
to
exercise
her
own
judgment
was
in
refusing
to
comply
with
her
father
wish
that
she
should
become
a
nun
on
this
subject
though
often
pressed
she
had
remained
positive
always
pleading
that
she
felt
no
call
to
the
sacred
duties
which
would
be
required
and
innocently
assuring
her
father
that
if
allowed
to
remain
at
home
she
would
cause
him
no
trouble
and
but
little
expense
so
she
had
remained
at
home
and
had
inured
herself
to
bear
without
grumbling
or
thinking
that
she
had
cause
for
grumbling
the
petulance
of
her
father
and
the
more
cruel
harshness
and
of
her
brother
in
all
the
family
schemes
of
aggrandisement
she
had
been
set
aside
and
barry
had
been
intended
by
the
father
as
the
scion
on
whom
all
the
family
honours
were
to
fall
his
education
had
been
expensive
his
allowance
liberal
and
his
whims
permitted
while
anty
was
never
better
dressed
than
a
decent
english
servant
and
had
been
taught
nothing
save
the
lessons
she
had
learnt
from
her
mother
who
died
when
she
was
but
thirteen
mrs
lynch
had
died
before
the
commencement
of
sim
palmy
days
they
had
seen
no
company
in
her
time
for
they
were
then
only
rising
people
and
since
that
the
great
friends
to
whom
sim
in
his
wealth
had
attached
himself
and
with
whom
alone
he
intended
that
barry
should
associate
were
all
of
the
masculine
gender
he
gave
bachelor
to
young
men
for
whom
anty
was
well
contented
to
cook
and
when
they
as
they
often
from
the
effect
of
their
potations
were
perforce
obliged
to
do
stayed
the
night
at
dunmore
house
anty
never
showed
herself
in
the
breakfast
parlour
but
boiled
the
eggs
made
the
tea
and
took
her
own
breakfast
in
the
kitchen
it
was
not
wonderful
therefore
that
no
one
proposed
for
anty
and
though
all
who
knew
the
lynches
knew
that
sim
had
a
daughter
it
was
very
generally
given
out
that
she
was
not
so
wise
as
her
neighbours
and
the
father
and
brother
took
no
pains
to
deny
the
rumour
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
knew
better
the
lynches
were
very
generally
disliked
and
the
shameful
way
miss
anty
was
trated
was
often
discussed
in
the
little
shops
and
many
of
the
townspeople
were
ready
to
aver
that
simple
or
no
anty
lynch
was
the
best
of
the
breed
matters
stood
thus
at
dunmore
when
the
quarrel
before
alluded
to
occurred
and
when
sim
made
his
will
dividing
his
property
and
died
before
destroying
it
as
he
doubtless
would
have
done
when
his
passion
was
over
great
was
the
surprise
of
every
one
concerned
and
of
many
who
were
not
at
all
concerned
when
it
was
ascertained
that
anty
lynch
was
an
heiress
and
that
she
was
now
possessed
of
four
hundred
pounds
in
her
own
right
but
the
passion
of
her
brother
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
he
soon
however
found
that
it
was
too
literally
true
and
that
no
direct
means
were
at
hand
by
which
he
could
deprive
his
sister
of
her
patrimony
the
lawyer
when
he
informed
anty
of
her
fortune
and
present
station
made
her
understand
that
she
had
an
equal
right
with
her
brother
in
everything
in
the
house
and
though
at
first
she
tacitly
acquiesced
in
his
management
she
was
not
at
all
simple
enough
to
be
ignorant
of
the
rights
of
possession
or
weak
enough
to
relinquish
them
barry
soon
made
up
his
mind
that
as
she
had
and
must
have
the
property
all
he
could
now
do
was
to
take
care
that
it
should
revert
to
him
as
her
heir
and
the
measure
of
most
importance
in
effecting
this
would
be
to
take
care
that
she
did
not
marry
in
his
first
passion
after
his
father
death
he
had
been
rough
and
cruel
to
her
but
he
soon
changed
his
conduct
and
endeavoured
to
flatter
her
into
docility
at
one
moment
and
to
frighten
her
into
obedience
in
the
next
he
soon
received
another
blow
which
was
also
a
severe
one
moylan
the
old
man
who
proposed
the
match
to
martin
called
on
him
and
showed
him
that
anty
had
appointed
him
her
agent
and
had
executed
the
necessary
legal
documents
for
the
purpose
upon
this
subject
he
argued
for
a
long
time
with
his
sister
pointing
out
to
her
that
the
old
man
would
surely
rob
her
offering
to
act
as
her
agent
himself
recommending
others
as
more
honest
and
fitting
and
lastly
telling
her
that
she
was
an
obstinate
fool
who
would
soon
be
robbed
of
every
penny
she
had
and
that
she
would
die
in
a
workhouse
at
last
but
anty
though
she
dreaded
her
brother
was
firm
wonderful
as
it
may
appear
she
even
loved
him
she
begged
him
not
to
quarrel
with
her
promised
to
do
everything
to
oblige
him
and
answered
his
wrath
with
gentleness
but
it
was
of
no
avail
barry
knew
that
her
agent
was
a
plotter
that
he
would
plot
against
his
influence
though
he
little
guessed
then
what
would
be
the
first
step
moylan
would
take
or
how
likely
it
would
be
if
really
acted
on
to
lead
to
his
sister
comfort
and
happiness
after
this
barry
passed
two
months
of
great
misery
and
vexation
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
what
to
do
or
what
final
steps
to
take
either
about
the
property
his
sister
or
himself
at
first
he
thought
of
frightening
moylan
and
his
sister
by
pretending
that
he
would
prove
anty
to
be
of
weak
mind
and
not
fit
to
manage
her
own
affairs
and
that
he
would
indict
the
old
man
for
conspiracy
but
he
felt
that
moylan
was
not
a
man
to
be
frightened
by
such
bugbears
then
he
made
up
his
mind
to
turn
all
he
had
into
money
to
leave
his
sister
to
the
dogs
or
any
one
who
might
choose
to
rob
her
and
go
and
live
abroad
then
he
thought
if
his
sister
should
die
what
a
pity
it
would
be
he
should
lose
it
all
and
how
he
should
blame
himself
if
she
were
to
die
soon
after
having
married
some
low
adventurer
and
he
reflected
how
probable
such
a
thing
would
be
how
likely
that
such
a
man
would
soon
get
rid
of
her
and
then
his
mind
began
to
dwell
on
her
death
and
to
wish
for
it
he
found
himself
constantly
thinking
of
it
and
ruminating
on
it
and
determining
that
it
was
the
only
event
which
could
set
him
right
his
own
debts
would
swallow
up
half
his
present
property
and
how
could
he
bring
himself
to
live
on
the
pitiful
remainder
when
that
stupid
idiot
as
he
called
her
to
himself
had
three
times
more
than
she
could
possibly
want
morning
after
morning
he
walked
about
the
small
grounds
round
the
house
with
his
hat
over
his
eyes
and
his
hands
tossing
about
the
money
in
his
pockets
thinking
of
this
cursing
his
father
and
longing
almost
praying
for
his
sister
death
then
he
would
have
his
horse
and
flog
the
poor
beast
along
the
roads
without
going
anywhere
or
having
any
object
in
view
but
always
turning
the
same
thing
over
and
over
in
his
mind
and
after
dinner
he
would
sit
by
the
hour
over
the
fire
drinking
longing
for
his
sister
money
and
calculating
the
probabilities
of
his
ever
possessing
it
he
began
to
imagine
all
the
circumstances
which
might
lead
to
her
death
he
thought
of
all
the
ways
in
which
persons
situated
as
she
was
might
and
often
did
die
he
reflected
without
knowing
that
he
was
doing
so
on
the
probability
of
robbers
breaking
into
the
house
if
she
were
left
alone
in
it
and
of
their
murdering
her
he
thought
of
silly
women
setting
their
own
clothes
on
fire
of
their
falling
out
of
window
drowning
themselves
of
their
perishing
in
a
hundred
possible
but
improbable
ways
it
was
after
he
had
been
drinking
a
while
that
these
ideas
became
most
vivid
before
his
eyes
and
seemed
like
golden
dreams
the
accomplishment
of
which
he
could
hardly
wish
for
and
at
last
as
the
fumes
of
the
spirit
gave
him
courage
other
and
more
horrible
images
would
rise
to
his
imagination
and
the
drops
of
sweat
would
stand
on
his
brow
as
he
would
invent
schemes
by
which
were
he
so
inclined
he
could
accelerate
without
detection
the
event
for
which
he
so
ardently
longed
with
such
thoughts
would
he
turn
into
bed
and
though
in
the
morning
he
would
try
to
dispel
the
ideas
in
which
he
had
indulged
overnight
they
still
left
their
impression
on
his
mind
they
added
bitterness
to
his
hatred
and
made
him
look
on
himself
as
a
man
injured
by
his
father
and
sister
and
think
that
he
owed
it
to
himself
to
redress
his
injuries
by
some
extraordinary
means
it
was
whilst
barry
lynch
was
giving
way
to
such
thoughts
as
these
and
vainly
endeavouring
to
make
up
his
mind
as
to
what
he
would
do
that
martin
made
his
offer
to
anty
to
tell
the
truth
it
was
sister
meg
who
had
made
the
first
overture
and
as
anty
had
not
rejected
it
with
any
great
disdain
but
had
rather
shown
a
disposition
to
talk
about
it
as
a
thing
just
possible
martin
had
repeated
it
in
person
and
had
reiterated
it
till
anty
had
at
last
taught
herself
to
look
upon
it
as
a
likely
and
desirable
circumstance
martin
had
behaved
openly
and
honourably
with
regard
to
the
money
part
of
the
business
telling
his
contemplated
bride
that
it
was
of
course
her
fortune
which
had
first
induced
him
to
think
of
her
but
adding
that
he
would
also
value
her
and
love
her
for
herself
if
she
would
allow
him
he
described
to
her
the
sort
of
settlement
he
should
propose
and
ended
by
recommending
an
early
day
for
the
wedding
anty
had
sense
enough
to
be
pleased
at
his
straightforward
and
honest
manner
and
though
she
did
not
say
much
to
himself
she
said
a
great
deal
in
his
praise
to
meg
which
all
found
its
way
to
martin
ears
but
still
he
could
not
get
over
the
difficulty
which
he
had
described
to
lord
ballindine
anty
wanted
to
wait
till
her
brother
should
go
out
of
the
country
and
martin
was
afraid
that
he
would
not
go
and
things
were
in
this
state
when
he
started
for
dublin
the
village
of
dunmore
has
nothing
about
it
which
can
especially
recommend
it
to
the
reader
it
has
none
of
those
beauties
of
nature
which
have
taught
irishmen
to
consider
their
country
as
the
first
flower
of
the
earth
and
first
gem
of
the
sea
it
is
a
dirty
ragged
little
town
standing
in
a
very
poor
part
of
the
country
with
nothing
about
it
to
induce
the
traveller
to
go
out
of
his
beaten
track
it
is
on
no
high
road
and
is
blessed
with
no
adventitious
circumstances
to
add
to
its
prosperity
it
was
once
the
property
of
the
but
in
those
times
the
landed
proprietors
thought
but
little
of
the
towns
and
now
it
is
parcelled
out
among
different
owners
some
of
whom
would
think
it
folly
to
throw
away
a
penny
on
the
place
and
others
of
whom
have
not
a
penny
to
throw
away
it
consists
of
a

i
must
beg
the
reader
to
presume
himself
to
be
present
there
with
me
on
the
morning
on
which
the
two
young
kellys
went
to
hear
sheil
speech
at
about
ten
the
widow
kelly
and
her
daughters
were
busy
in
the

which
occupied
the
most
important
part
of
the
of
the
inn
it
was
a
long
scrambling
house
next
to
the
shop
and
opening
out
of
it
was
a
large
furnished
with
narrow
benches
and
rickety
tables
and
here
the
more
humble
of
kelly
guests
regaled
themselves
on
the
other
side
of
this
was
the
hall
or
passage
of
the
house
and
next
to
that
again
a
large
dingy
dark
kitchen

in
which
were
always
congregated
a
parcel
of
ragged
old
men
boys
and
noisy
women
pretending
to
be
busy
but
usually
doing
but
little
good
and
attracted
by
the
warmth
of
the
big
fire
and
the
hopes
of
some
scraps
of
food
and
drink
for
the
widow
kelly
god
bless
her
was
a
thrue
christhian
and
begrudge
the
poor
more
power
to
her
like
some
upstarts
who
might
live
to
be
in
want
yet
glory
be
to
the
almighty
the
difference
of
the
english
and
irish
character
is
nowhere
more
plainly
discerned
than
in
their
respective
kitchens
with
the
former
this
apartment
is
probably
the
cleanest
and
certainly
the
most
orderly
in
the
house
it
is
rarely
intruded
into
by
those
unconnected
in
some
way
with
its
business
everything
it
contains
is
under
the
vigilant
eye
of
its
chief
occupant
who
would
imagine
it
quite
impossible
to
carry
on
her
business
whether
of
an
humble
or
important
nature
if
her
apparatus
was
subjected
to
the
hands
of
the
unauthorised
an
irish
kitchen
is
devoted
to
hospitality
in
every
sense
of
the
word
its
doors
are
open
to
almost
all
loungers
and
idlers
and
the
chances
are
that
billy
bawn
the
cripple
or
judy
molloy
the
deaf
old
hag
are
more
likely
to
know
where
to
find
the
required
utensil
than
the
cook
herself
it
is
usually
a
temple
dedicated
to
the
goddess
of
disorder
and
too
often
joined
with
her
is
the
potent
deity
of
dirt
it
is
not
that
things
are
out
of
their
place
for
they
have
no
place
it
is
that
the
floor
is
not
scoured
for
you
can
not
scour
dry
mud
into
anything
but
wet
mud
it
is
that
the
chairs
and
tables
look
filthy
for
there
are
none
it
is
that
the
pots
and
plates
and
pans
do
shine
for
you
see
none
to
shine
all
you
see
is
a
grimy
black
ceiling
an
uneven
clay
floor
a
small
darkened
window
one
or
two
recesses
a
heap
of
potatoes
in
the
corner
a
pile
of
turf
against
the
wall
two
pigs
and
a
dog
under
the
single
dresser
three
or
four
chickens
on
the
an
old
cock
moaning
on
the
top
of
a
rickety
press
and
a
crowd
of
ragged
garments
squatting
standing
kneeling
and
crouching
round
the
fire
from
which
issues
a
babel
of
strange
tongues
not
one
word
of
which
is
at
first
intelligible
to
ears
unaccustomed
to
such
eloquence
and
yet
out
of
these
unfathomable
unintelligible
dens
proceed
in
due
time
dinners
of
which
the
appearance
of
them
gives
no
promise
such
a
kitchen
was
kelly
and
yet
it
was
well
known
and
attested
by
those
who
had
often
tried
the
experiment
that
a
man
need
think
it
no
misfortune
to
have
to
get
his
dinner
his
punch
and
his
bed
at
the
widow
above
stairs
were
two
and
a
colony
of
occupied
indiscriminately
by
the
family
or
by
such
customers
as
might
require
them
if
you
came
back
to
dine
at
the
inn
after
a
day
shooting
on
the
bogs
you
would
probably
find
miss
jane
on
the
table
or
miss
meg
album
on
the
sofa
and
when
a
little
accustomed
to
sojourn
at
such
places
you
would
feel
no
surprise
at
discovering
their
dresses
turned
inside
out
and
hanging
on
the
pegs
in
your
or
at
seeing
their
and
black
pins
in
the
drawer
of
your
on
the
morning
in
question
the
widow
and
her
daughters
were
engaged
in
the
shop
putting
up
of
sugar
cutting
bits
of
tobacco
tying
bundles
of
dip
candles
attending
to
chance
customers
and
preparing
for
the
more
busy
hours
of
the
day
it
was
evident
that
something
had
occurred
at
the
inn
which
had
ruffled
the
even
tenor
of
its
way
the
widow
was
peculiarly
gloomy
though
fond
of
her
children
she
was
an
autocrat
in
her
house
and
accustomed
as
autocrats
usually
are
to
scold
a
good
deal
and
now
she
was
using
her
tongue
pretty
freely
it
was
the
girls
however
she
was
rating
for
they
could
answer
for
themselves
and
did
when
they
thought
it
necessary
but
now
they
were
demure
conscious
and
quiet
kelly
was
denouncing
one
of
the
reputed
sins
of
the
province
to
which
she
belonged
and
describing
the
horrors
of
schaming
them
underhand
ways
she
declared
niver
come
to
no
good
av
thrue
what
father
connel
afther
telling
me
there
harum
come
of
it
before
it
done
and
over
schaming
schaming
and
schaming
for
iver
the
back
of
my
hand
to
such
doings
i
wish
the
tongue
had
been
out
of
moylan
mouth
the
ould
rogue
before
he
put
the
thing
in
his
head
av
he
wanted
the
young
woman
and
she
was
willing
why
not
take
her
in
a
dacent
way
and
have
done
with
it
i
sure
she
ould
enough
but
what
does
he
want
with
a
wife
like
her
making
innimies
for
himself
i
suppose
he
be
sitting
up
for
a
gentleman
now
bad
cess
to
them
for
gentry
not
but
that
he
as
good
a
right
as
some
and
a
dale
more
than
others
who
are
ashamed
to
put
their
hand
to
a
turn
of
work
i
hate
such
huggery
muggery
work
up
in
a
corner
half
your
own
doing
and
a
nice
piece
of
work
it
be
when
he
got
an
ould
wife
and
a
dozen
lawsuits
when
he
finds
his
farm
gone
and
his
pockets
empty
for
it
be
a
dale
asier
for
him
to
be
getting
the
wife
than
the
money
when
he
got
every
body
abuse
and
nothing
else
by
his
bargain
it
was
very
apparent
that
martin
secret
had
not
been
well
kept
and
that
the
fact
of
his
intended
marriage
with
anty
lynch
was
soon
likely
to
be
known
to
all
dunmore
the
truth
was
that
moylan
had
begun
to
think
himself
overreached
in
the
matter
to
be
afraid
that
by
the
very
measure
he
had
himself
proposed
he
would
lose
all
share
in
the
great
prize
he
had
put
in
martin
way
and
that
he
should
himself
be
the
means
of
excluding
his
own
finger
from
the
pie
it
appeared
to
him
that
if
he
allowed
this
his
own
folly
would
only
be
equalled
by
the
young
man
ingratitude
and
he
determined
therefore
if
possible
to
prevent
the
match
whereupon
he
told
the
matter
as
a
secret
to
those
whom
he
knew
would
set
it
moving
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
it
reached
the
ears
of
father
connel
and
he
lost
none
in
stepping
down
to
learn
the
truth
of
so
important
a
piece
of
luck
to
one
of
his
parishioners
and
to
congratulate
the
widow
here
however
he
was
out
in
his
reckoning
for
she
declared
she
did
not
believe
it
that
it
was
and
be
true
and
it
was
only
after
his
departure
that
she
succeeded
in
extracting
the
truth
from
her
daughters
the
news
however
quickly
reached
the
kitchen
and
its
lazy
crowd
and
the
inn
door
and
its
constant
loungers
and
was
readily
and
gladly
credited
in
both
places
crone
after
crone
and
cripple
after
cripple
hurried
into
the
shop
to
congratulate
the
angry
widow
on
masther
martin
luck
and
war
he
worthy
of
it
the
handsome
jewel
and
would
he
look
the
gintleman
every
inch
of
him
and
sally
expatiated
greatly
on
it
in
the
kitchen
and
drank
both
their
healths
in
an
extra
pot
of
tea
and
kate
grinned
her
delight
and
jack
the
ostler
who
took
care
of
martin
horse
boasted
loudly
of
it
in
the
street
declaring
that
it
was
a
good
thing
enough
for
anty
lynch
with
all
her
money
to
get
a
husband
at
all
out
of
the
kellys
for
the
divil
a
know
any
one
knowed
in
the
counthry
where
the
lynchs
come
from
but
every
one
knowed
who
the
kellys
wor
and
martin
was
that
far
from
the
lord
himself
there
was
great
commotion
during
the
whole
day
at
the
inn
some
said
martin
had
gone
to
town
to
buy
furniture
others
that
he
had
done
so
to
prove
the
will
one
suggested
that
he
surely
have
to
fight
barry
and
another
prayed
that
if
he
did
he
might
kill
the
blackguard
and
have
all
the
fortin
to
himself
out
and
out
god
bless
him
a
loving
brother
the
great
news
was
not
long
before
it
reached
the
ears
of
one
not
disposed
to
receive
the
information
with
much
satisfaction
and
this
was
barry
lynch
the
proposed
bride
amiable
brother
the
medium
through
which
he
first
heard
it
was
not
one
likely
to
add
to
his
good
humour
jacky
the
fool
had
for
many
years
been
attached
to
the
kelly
court
family
that
is
to
say
he
had
attached
himself
to
it
by
getting
his
food
in
the
kitchen
and
calling
himself
the
lord
fool
but
latterly
he
had
quarrelled
with
kelly
court
and
had
insisted
on
being
sim
lynch
fool
much
to
the
chagrin
of
that
old
man
and
since
his
death
he
had
nearly
maddened
barry
by
following
him
through
the
street
and
being
continually
found
at
the
when
he
went
out
jack
attendance
was
certainly
dictated
by
affection
rather
than
any
mercenary
views
for
he
never
got
a
scrap
out
of
the
dunmore
house
kitchen
or
a
halfpenny
from
his
new
patron
but
still
he
was
fool
and
like
other
fools
a
desperate
annoyance
to
his
master
on
the
day
in
question
as
young
lynch
was
riding
out
of
the
gate
about
three
in
the
afternoon
there
as
usual
was
jack
now
yer

jacky
you
not
forget
your
own
fool
mr
barry
barry
did
not
condescend
to
answer
this
customary
appeal
but
only
looked
at
the
poor
ragged
fellow
as
though
he
like
to
flog
the
life
out
of
him
shure
your
honour
barry

this
the
time
then
to
open
yer

hand
when
miss
anty

great
match

thing

a
lord
shure
yer
honour
not
be
refusing
me
this
blessed
day
what
the
d
are
you
saying
about
miss
lynch
said
barry
his
attention
somewhat
arrested
by
the
mention
of
his
sister
name
is
she
going
to
be
married
then
to
the
dacentest
fellow
in
dunmore
martin
kelly
god
bless
him
ah
there
be
fine
times
at
dunmore
then
he
not
the
boy
to
rattle
a
poor
divil
out
of
the
kitchen
into
the
cold
winther
night
the
kellys
was
always
the
right
sort
for
the
poor
barry
was
frightened
in
earnest
now
it
struck
him
at
once
that
jack
could
have
made
the
story
out
of
his
own
head
and
the
idea
that
there
was
any
truth
in
it
nearly
knocked
him
off
his
horse
he
rode
on
however
trying
to
appear
to
be
regardless
of
what
had
been
said
to
him
and
as
he
trotted
off
he
heard
the
fool
parting
salutation
and
will
yer
honour
be
forgething
me
afther
the
news
i
brought
yer
well
hard
as
ye
are
misther
barry
i
hot
yer
now
any
way
and
in
truth
jack
had
hit
him
hard
of
all
things
that
could
happen
to
him
this
would
be
about
the
worst
he
had
often
thought
with
dread
of
his
sister
marrying
and
of
his
thus
being
forced
to
divide
everything
all
his
spoil
with
some
confounded
stranger
but
for
her
to
marry
a
shopkeeper
son
in
the
very
village
in
which
he
lived
was
more
than
he
could
bear
he
could
never
hold
up
his
head
in
the
county
again
and
then
he
thought
of
his
debts
and
tried
to
calculate
whether
he
might
get
over
to
france
without
paying
them
and
be
able
to
carry
his
share
of
the
property
with
him
and
so
he
went
on
pursuing
his
wretched
uneasy
solitary
ride
sometimes
sauntering
along
at
a
snail
pace
and
then
again
spurring
the
poor
brute
and
endeavouring
to
bring
his
mind
to
some
settled
plan
but
whenever
he
did
so
the
idea
of
his
sister
death
was
the
only
one
which
seemed
to
present
either
comfort
or
happiness
he
made
up
his
mind
at
last
to
put
a
bold
face
on
the
matter
to
find
out
from
anty
herself
whether
there
was
any
truth
in
the
story
and
if
there
should
be
for
he
felt
confident
she
would
not
be
able
to
deceive
him
to
frighten
her
and
the
whole
party
of
the
kellys
out
of
what
he
considered
a
damnable
conspiracy
to
rob
him
of
his
property
he
got
off
his
horse
and
stalked
into
the
house
on
inquiry
he
found
that
anty
was
in
her
own
room
he
was
sorry
she
was
not
out
for
to
tell
the
truth
he
was
rather
anxious
to
put
off
the
meeting
as
he
did
not
feel
himself
quite
up
to
the
mark
and
was
ashamed
of
seeming
afraid
of
her
he
went
into
the
stable
and
abused
the
groom
into
the
kitchen
and
swore
at
the
maid
and
then
into
the
garden
it
was
a
nasty
cold
february
day
and
he
walked
up
and
down
the
damp
muddy
walks
till
he
was
too
tired
and
cold
to
walk
longer
and
then
turned
into
the
parlour
and
remained
with
his
back
to
the
fire
till
the
man
came
in
to
lay
the
cloth
thinking
on
the
one
subject
that
occupied
all
his
mind
occasionally
grinding
his
teeth
and
heaping
curses
on
his
father
and
sister
who
together
had
inflicted
such
grievous
such
unexpected
injuries
upon
him
if
at
this
moment
there
was
a
soul
in
all
ireland
over
whom
satan
had
full
dominion
if
there
was
a
breast
unoccupied
by
one
good
thought
if
there
was
a
heart
wishing
a
brain
conceiving
and
organs
ready
to
execute
all
that
was
evil
from
the
worst
motives
they
were
to
be
found
in
that
miserable
creature
as
he
stood
there
urging
himself
on
to
hate
those
whom
he
should
have
loved
cursing
those
who
were
nearest
to
him
fearing
her
whom
he
had
all
his
life
and
striving
to
pluck
up
courage
to
take
such
measures
as
might
entirely
quell
her
money
was
to
him
the
only
source
of
gratification
he
had
looked
forward
when
a
boy
to
his
manhood
as
a
period
when
he
might
indulge
unrestrained
in
pleasures
which
money
would
buy
and
when
a
man
to
his
father
death
as
a
time
when
those
means
would
be
at
his
full
command
he
had
neither
ambition
nor
affection
in
his
nature
his
father
had
taught
him
nothing
but
the
excellence
of
money
and
having
fully
imbued
him
with
this
had
cut
him
off
from
the
use
of
it
he
was
glad
when
he
found
that
dinner
was
at
hand
and
that
he
could
not
now
see
his
sister
until
after
he
had
fortified
himself
with
drink
anty
rarely
if
ever
dined
with
him
so
he
sat
down
and
swallowed
his
solitary
meal
he
did
not
eat
much
but
he
gulped
down
three
or
four
glasses
of
wine
and
immediately
on
having
done
so
he
desired
the
servant
with
a
curse
to
bring
him
hot
water
and
sugar
and
not
to
keep
him
waiting
all
night
for
a
tumbler
of
punch
as
he
did
usually
before
the
man
had
got
into
the
kitchen
he
rang
the
bell
again
and
when
the
servant
returned
breathless
with
the
steaming
jug
he
threatened
to
turn
him
out
of
the
house
at
once
if
he
was
not
quicker
in
obeying
the
orders
given
him
he
then
made
a
tumbler
of
punch
filling
the
glass
half
full
of
spirits
and
drinking
it
so
hot
as
to
scald
his
throat
and
when
that
was
done
he
again
rang
the
bell
and
desired
the
servant
to
tell
miss
anty
that
he
wanted
to
speak
to
her
when
the
door
was
shut
he
mixed
more
drink
to
support
his
courage
during
the
interview
and
made
up
his
mind
that
nothing
should
daunt
him
from
preventing
the
marriage
in
one
way
or
another
when
anty
opened
the
door
he
was
again
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
his
hands
in
his
pockets
the
flaps
of
his
coat
hanging
over
his
arms
his
shoulders
against
the
and
his
foot
on
the
chair
on
which
he
had
been
sitting
his
face
was
red
and
his
eyes
were
somewhat
he
had
always
a
surly
look
though
from
his
black
hair
and
large
bushy
whiskers
many
people
would
have
called
him
good
looking
but
now
there
was
a
scowl
in
his
restless
eyes
which
frightened
anty
when
she
saw
it
and
the
thick
drops
of
perspiration
on
his
forehead
did
not
add
benignity
to
his
face
were
you
wanting
me
barry
said
anty
who
was
the
first
to
speak
what
do
you
stand
there
for
with
the
door
open
replied
her
brother
d
you
think
i
want
the
servants
to
hear
what
i
got
to
say
i
do

said
anty
shutting
the
door
but
they
hear
just
as
well
now
av
they
wish
for
they
come
to
the
will
they
by
g
said
barry
and
he
rushed
to
the
door
which
he
banged
open
finding
no
victim
outside
on
whom
to
exercise
his
wrath
let
me
catch
and
he
returned
to
his
position
by
the
fire
anty
had
sat
down
on
a
sofa
that
stood
by
the
wall
opposite
the
fireplace
and
barry
remained
for
a
minute
thinking
how
he
open
the
campaign
at
last
he
began
anty
look
you
here
now
what
scheme
have
you
got
in
your
head

me
know
at
once
what

better
i
no
schame
in
my
head
that
i

secret

me
i
your
brother
and
have
a
right
to
know
what

he
did
like
to
ask
her
at
once
whether
she
was
going
to
get
married
it
might
not
be
true
and
then
he
would
only
be
putting
the
idea
into
her
head
why

he
walked
away
from
the
fire
and
came
and
stood
opposite
to
her
as
she
sat
upon
the
sofa

you
going
to

continued
stamping
on
the
floor

violently
than

in
the
room

more
and
she
got
up
to
go
to
the
door
barry
however
rushed
before
her
and
prevented
her
he
turned
the
lock
and
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
and
then
he
caught
her
arm
as
she
attempted
to
get
to
the
bell
and
dragged
her
back
to
the
sofa
you
not
off
so
easy
as
that
i
can
tell
you
why
d
you
think
you
to
marry
whom
you

without
even
telling
me
of
it
what
think
the
world
would
say
of
me
if
i
were
to
let
such
an
idiot
as
you
be
caught
up
by
the
first
sharper
that
tried
to
rob
you
of
your
money
now
look
here
and
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
laid
his
hand
violently
on
her
arm
as
he
spoke
you
do
go
out
of
this
room
alive
until
you
given
me
your
solemn
promise
and
sworn
on
the
cross
that
you
never
marry
without
my
consent
and
you
give
me
that
in
writing
too
anty
at
first
turned
very
pale
when
she
felt
his
heavy
hand
on
her
arm
and
saw
his
red
glaring
eyes
so
near
her
own
but
when
he
said
she
should
leave
the
room
alive
she
jumped
from
the
sofa
and
shrieked
at
the
top
of
her
shrill
voice
oh
barry
you
not
murdher
me
shure
you
would
murdher
your
own
sisther
barry
was
rather
frightened
at
the
noise
and
moreover
the
word
murder
quelled
him
but
when
he
found
after
a
moment
pause
that
the
servants
had
not
heard
or
had
not
heeded
his
sister
he
determined
to
carry
on
his
game
now
that
he
had
proceeded
so
far
he
took
however
a
long
drink
out
of
his
tumbler
to
give
him
fresh
courage
and
then
returned
to
the
charge
who
talked
of
murdering
you
but
if
you
bellow
in
that
way
i
gag
you
it
a
great
deal
i
asking
indeed
that
when
i
your
only
guardian
my
advice
should
be
asked
for
before
you
throw
away
your
money
on
a
low
ruffian
you
more
fit
for
a
than
to
be
any
man
wife
and
by
heaven
that
where
i
put
you
if
you
give
me
the
promise
i
ask
will
you
swear
you
marry
no
one
without
my
leave
poor
anty
shook
with
fear
as
she
sate
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
her
brother
face
he
was
nearly
drunk
now
and
she
felt
that
he
was
so
and
he
looked
so
hot
and
so
fierce
so
red
and
cruel
that
she
was
all
but
paralysed
nevertheless
she
mustered
strength
to
say

i
tell
you
everything

if

wo
make
the
promise
i
telling
you
by
this
time
anty
presence
of
mind
had
clean
left
her
indeed
all
the
faculties
of
her
reason
had
vanished
and
as
she
saw
her
scowling
face
so
near
her
own
and
heard
him
threatening
to
drag
her
to
a
she
put
her
hands
before
her
eyes
and
made
one
rush
to
escape
from
him
to
the
door
to
the
window
anywhere
to
get
out
of
his
reach
barry
was
quite
drunk
now
had
he
not
been
so
even
he
would
hardly
have
done
what
he
then
did
as
she
endeavoured
to
rush
by
him
he
raised
his
fist
and
struck
her
on
the
face
with
all
his
force
the
blow
fell
upon
her
hands
as
they
were
crossed
over
her
face
but
the
force
of
the
blow
knocked
her
down
and
she
fell
upon
the
floor
senseless
striking
the
back
of
her
head
against
the
table
confound
her
muttered
the
brute
between
his
teeth
as
she
fell
for
an
obstinate
fool
what
the
d
l
shall
i
do
now
anty
get
up

up
will
you
what
ails
you
and
then
again
to
himself
the
d
l
seize
her
what
am
i
to
do
now
and
he
succeeded
in
dragging
her
on
to
the
sofa
the
and
the
cook
although
up
to
this
point
they
had
considered
it
would
be
ill
manners
to
interrupt
the
brother
and
sister
in
their
family
interview
were
nevertheless
at
the
door
and
though
they
could
see
nothing
and
did
not
succeed
in
hearing
much
were
not
the
less
fully
aware
that
the
conversation
was
of
a
somewhat
stormy
nature
on
the
part
of
the
brother
when
they
heard
the
noise
which
followed
the
blow
though
not
exactly
knowing
what
had
happened
they
became
frightened
and
began
to
think
something
terrible
was
being
done

parleying
she
rapped
her
knuckles
loudly
against
the
door
and
as
she
did
so
terry
sneaked
away
to
the
kitchen
barry
had
just
succeeded
in
raising
his
sister
to
the
sofa
as
he
heard
the
knock
who
that
he
called
out
loudly
what

moment
consideration
he
went
and
unlocked
the
door
or
go
in
and
see
what
she
wants
she
fainted
i
think
barry
lynch
walked
out
of
the
room
and
into
the
garden
before
the
house
to
think
over
what
he
had
done
and
what
he
better
do
for
the
future
leaving
anty
to
the
care
of
the
frightened
woman
she
soon
came
to
herself
and
excepting
that
her
head
was
bruised
in
the
fall
was
not
much
hurt
the
blow
falling
on
her
hands
had
neither
cut
nor
marked
her
but
she
was
for
a
long
time
so
flurried
that
she
did
not
know
where
she
was
and
in
answer
to
all
tender
inquiries
as
to
the
cause
of
her
fall
and
anathemas
as
to
the
master
bad
temper
merely
said
that
she
get
to
bed
for
her
head
ached
so
she
did
know
where
she
was
to
bed
accordingly
she
went
and
glad
she
was
to
have
escaped
alive
from
that
drunken
face
which
had
glared
on
her
for
the
last
half
hour
after
wandering
about
round
the
house
and
through
the
grounds
for
above
an
hour
barry
returned
half
sobered
to
the
room
but
in
his
present
state
of
mind
he
could
not
go
to
bed
sober
he
ordered
more
hot
water
and
again
sat
down
alone
to
drink
and
drown
the
remorse
he
was
beginning
to
feel
for
what
he
had
done
or
rather
not
remorse
but
the
feeling
of
fear
that
every
one
would
know
how
he
had
treated
anty
and
that
they
would
side
with
her
against
him
whichever
way
he
looked
all
was
misery
and
disappointment
to
him
and
his
only
hope
for
the
present
was
in
drink
there
he
sat
for
a
long
time
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
turf
till
it
was
all
burnt
out
trying
to
get
fresh
courage
from
the
spirits
he
swallowed
and
swearing
to
himself
that
he
would
not
be
beat
by
a
woman
about
one
he
seized
one
of
the
candles
and
staggered
up
to
bed
as
he
passed
his
sister
door
he
opened
it
and
went
in
she
was
fast
asleep
her
shoes
were
off
and
the
were
thrown
over
her
but
she
was
not
undressed
he
slowly
shut
the
door
and
stood
for
some
moments
looking
at
her
then
walking
to
the
bed
he
took
her
shoulder
and
shook
it
as
gently
as
his
drunkenness
would
let
him
this
did
not
wake
her
so
he
put
the
candle
down
on
the
table
close
beside
the
bed
and
steadying
himself
against
the
bedstead
he
shook
her
again
and
again
anty
he
whispered
anty
and
at
last
she
opened
her
eyes
directly
she
saw
his
face
she
closed
them
again
and
buried
her
own
in
the
clothes
however
he
saw
that
she
was
awake
and
bending
his
head
he
muttered
loud
enough
for
her
to
hear
but
in
a
thick
harsh
hurried
drunken
voice
anty
d
hear
if
you
marry
that
man
i
have
your
life
and
then
leaving
the
candle
behind
him
he
staggered
off
into
his
own
room
in
the
dark
vi
the
escape
in
vain
after
that
did
anty
try
to
sleep
turn
which
way
she
would
she
saw
the
bloodshot
eyes
and
horrid
drunken
face
of
her
cruel
brother
for
a
long
time
she
lay
trembling
and
anxious
fearing
she
knew
not
what
and
trying
to
compose
herself
trying
to
make
herself
think
that
she
had
no
present
cause
for
fear
but
in
vain
if
she
heard
a
noise
she
thought
it
was
her
brother
footstep
and
when
the
house
was
perfectly
silent
and
still
she
feared
the
very
silence
itself
at
last
she
crept
out
of
bed
and
taking
the
candle
left
by
her
brother
which
had
now
burned
down
to
the
socket
stepped
softly
down
the
stairs
to
the
place
where
the
two
slept
and
having
awakened
them
she
made
biddy
return
with
her
and
keep
her
company
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
she
did
not
quite
tell
the
girl
all
that
had
passed
she
did
not
own
that
her
brother
had
threatened
to
send
her
to
a
madhouse
or
that
he
had
sworn
to
have
her
life
but
she
said
enough
to
show
that
he
had
shamefully
her
and
to
convince
biddy
that
wherever
her
mistress
might
find
a
home
it
would
be
very
unadvisable
that
she
and
barry
should
continue
to
live
under
the
same
roof
early
in
the
morning
long
afore
the
break
o
day
as
the
song
says
biddy
got
up
from
her
hard
bed
on
the
floor

started
to
carry
into
immediate
execution
the
counsels

had
given
during
the
night
as
she
passed
the
head
of
the
stairs
she
heard
the
loud
snore
of
barry
in
his
drunken
slumber
and
wishing
that
he
might
sleep
as

for

back
again
the
two
crept
off
to
the
back
door
together
and
judy
having
opened
it
biddy
sallied
out
on
her
important
and
mission
it
was
still
dark
though
the
morning
was
beginning
to
break
as
she
stood
panting
at
the
front
door
of
the
inn
she
tried
to
get
in
at
the
back
but
the
yard
gates
were
fastened
and
jack
the
ostler
did
not
seem
to
be
about
yet
so
she
gave
a
timid
modest
knock
with
the
iron
knocker
on
the
front
door
a
pause
and
then
a
second
knock
a
little
louder
another
pause
and
then
a
third
and
then
as
no
one
came
she
remembered
the
importance
of
her
message
and
gave
such
a
rap
as
a
man
might
do
who
badly
wanted
a
glass
of
hot
drink
after
travelling
the
whole
night
the
servants
had
good
or
hardy
consciences
for
they
slept
soundly
but
the
widow
kelly
in
her
little
behind
the
shop
well
knew
the
sound
of
that
knocker
and
hurrying
on
her
slippers
and
her
gown
she
got
to
the
door
and
asked
who
was
there
is
that
sally
said
biddy

the
widow
voice

kelly

begged
av
me
to
help

and
she
went
up
to
her
room
and
laid
herself
down
and
i
thought
to
myself
that
at
any
rate
it
was
all
over
for
that
night
when
she
war
gone
the
masther
he
soon
come
back
into

just
like
the
divil
as

painted
only
for

after
that
terry
wint
to

and
i
and
judy
were
long
afther
him
for
we
did
care
to
be
sitting
up
alone
wid
him
and
he
mad
dhrunk
so
we
turned
in
and
we
were
in
bed
maybe
two
hours
or
so
and
fast
enough
when
down
come
the
misthress
as
pale
as
a
sheet
wid
a
candle
in
her
hand
and
begged
me
for
dear
life
to
come
up
into
her
room
to
her
and
so
i
did
in
coorse
and
then
she
tould
me
all
and
not
contint
with
what
he
done
down
stairs
but
the
dhrunken
ruffian
must
come
up
into
her
and
swear
the
most
dreadfullest
things
to
her
you
iver
heerd
mrs
kelly
the
words
he
war
afther
using
and
the
things
he
said
war
most
horrid
and
miss
anty
would
for
her
dear
life
nor
for
all
the
money
in
dunmore
stop
another
night
nor
another
day
in
the
house
wid
him
but
is
she
much
hurt
biddy
oh
her
head
cut
dreadful
where
she
fell
and
he
shuck
the
very
life
out
of
her
poor
carcase
so
he
did
mrs
kelly
the
ruffian
do
be
cursing
i
tell
you
girl
and
what
is
it
your
misthress
is
wishing
to
do
now
did
she
tell
you
to
come
to
me
no
she
did
exactly
tell
me
only
as
she
war
saying
that
she
would
for
anything
be
staying
in
the
house
with
mr
barry
and
as
she
did
seem
to
be
knowing
where
she
be
going
and
av
she
be
raally
going
to
be
married
to
mr
martin
drat
mr
martin
you
fool
did
she
tell
you
she
wanted
to
come
here
she
did
quite
say
as
much
as
that
to
tell
the
thruth
thin
it
wor
i
that
said
it
and
she
did
unsay
it
so
wid
that
i
thought
come
down
here
the
first
thing
and
av
you
mrs
kelly
wor
thinking
it
right
we
get
her
out
of
the
house
before
the
masther
stirring
the
widow
was
a
prudent
woman
and
she
stood
for
some
time
considering
for
she
felt
that
if
she
held
out
her
hand
to
anty
now
she
must
stick
to
her
through
and
through
in
the
battle
which
there
would
be
between
her
and
her
brother
and
there
might
be
more
plague
than
profit
in
that
but
then
again
she
was
not
at
all
so
indifferent
as
she
had
appeared
to
be
to
her
favourite
son
marrying
four
hundred
she
was
angry
at
his
thinking
of
such
a
thing
without
consulting
her
she
feared
the
legal
difficulties
he
must
encounter
and
she
did
like
the
thoughts
of
its
being
said
that
her
son
had
married
an
old
fool
and
cozened
her
out
of
her
money
but
still
four
hundred
was
a
great
thing
and
anty
was
a
tractable
young
woman
of
the
right
religion
and
would
not
make
a
bad
wife
and
on
reconsideration
mrs
kelly
thought
the
thing
was
to
be
sneezed
at
then
again
she
hated
barry
and
having
a
high
spirit
felt
indignant
that
he
should
think
of
preventing
her
son
from
marrying
his
sister
if
the
two
of
them
chose
to
do
it
and
she
knew
she
be
able
and
willing
enough
too
to
tell
him
a
bit
of
her
mind
if
there
should
be
occasion
and
lastly
and
most
powerfully
of
all
the
feeling
came
in
to
overcome
her
prudential
scruples
and
to
open
her
heart
and
her
house
to
a
poor
kindly
innocent
creature
as
anty
lynch
had
been
she
was
making
up
her
mind
what
to
do
and
determining
to
give
battle
royal
to
barry
and
all
his
satellites
on
behalf
of
anty
when
biddy
interrupted
her
by
saying
i
hope
i
war
wrong
in
coming
down
and
throubling
you
so
arly
i
thought
maybe

that
she
had

request
began
to
cry
and
to
stuff
the
corner
of
her
petticoat
into
her
eyes

said
the
widow

and

and
it

betther
for
her
jist
popping
into
miss
bed
than
getting
between
a
pair
of
cowld
sheets
these
preparations
met
with
biddy
entire
approval
for
she
reiterated
her
blessings
on
the
widow
as
she
went
to
announce
all
the
news
to
sally
and
kate
while
mrs
kelly
made
such
preparations
as
were
fitting
for
a
walk
at
that
early
hour
up
to
dunmore
house
they
were
not
long
before
they
were
under
weigh
but
they
did
not
reach
the
house
quite
so
quickly
as
biddy
had
left
it
mrs
kelly
had
to
pick
her
way
in
the
half
light
and
observed
that
she
never
been
up
to
the
house
since
old
simeon
lynch
built
it
and
when
the
stones
were
laying
for
it
she
did
think
she
ever
would
but
one
never
knowed
what
changes
might
happen
in
this
world
they
were
soon
in
the
house
for
judy
was
up
to
let
them
in
and
though
she
stared
when
she
saw
mrs
kelly
she
merely
curtsied
and
said
nothing
the
girl
went
upstairs
first
with
the
candle
and
mrs
kelly
followed
very
gently
on
tiptoe
she
need
not
have
been
so
careful
to
avoid
waking
barry
for
had
a
drove
of
oxen
been
driven
upstairs
it
would
not
have
roused
him
however
up
she
crept
her
thick
shoes
creaking
on
every
stair
and
stood
outside
the
door
while
biddy
went
in
to
break
the
news
of
her
arrival
anty
was
still
asleep
but
it
did
not
take
much
to
rouse
her
and
she
trembled
in
her
bed
when
on
her
asking
what
was
the
matter
mrs
kelly
popped
her
bonnet
inside
the
door
and
said
it
only
me
my
dear
mrs
kelly
you
know
from
the
inn
and
then
she
very
cautiously
insinuated
the
rest
of
her
body
into
the
room
as
though
she
thought
that
barry
was
asleep
under
the
bed
and
she
was
afraid
of
treading
on
one
of
his
stray
fingers
it
only
me
my
dear
biddy
been
down
to
me
like
a
good
girl
and
i
tell
you
what
this
is
no
place
for

just
at
present

be
batthered
and
bruised
and
perhaps
murthered
out
and
out
hush
biddy
do
be
saying
such
things
said
the
widow
who
had
a
great
idea
of
carrying
on
the
war
on
her
own
premises
but
who
felt
seriously
afraid
of
barry
now
that
she
was
in
his
house
do
be
saying
such
things
to
frighthen
her
but
you
be
asier
there
than
here
she
continued
to
anty
and
there
nothin

mrs
kelly
courage
waned
from
the
moment
of
her
leaving
her
own
door
and
it
did
not
return
till
she
felt
herself
within
it
again
indeed
as
she
was
leaving
the
gate
of
dunmore
house
with
anty
on
her
arm
she
was
already
beginning
to
repent
what
she
was
doing
for
there
were
idlers
about
and
she
felt
ashamed
of
carrying
off
the
young
heiress
but
these
feelings
vanished
the
moment
she
had
crossed
her
own
sill
when
she
had
once
got
anty
home
it
was
all
right
the
widow
kelly
seldom
went
out
into
the
world
she
seldom
went
anywhere
except
to
mass
and
when
out
she
was
a
very
modest
and
retiring
old
lady
but
she
could
face
the
devil
if
necessary
across
her
own
counter
and
so
anty
was
rescued
for
a
while
from
her
brother
persecution
this
happened
on
the
morning
on
which
martin
and
lord
ballindine
met
together
at
the
lawyer
when
the
deeds
were
prepared
which
young
kelly
genuine
honesty
made
him
think
necessary
before
he
eloped
with
old
sim
lynch
heiress
he
would
have
been
rather
surprised
to
hear
at
that
moment
that
his
mother
had
been
before
him
and
carried
off
his
bride
elect
to
the
inn
anty
was
soon
domesticated
the
widow
very
properly
would
let
her
friends
meg
and
jane
ask
her
any
questions
at
present
sally
had
made
on
the
occasion
a
pot
of
tea
sufficient
to
supply
the
morning
wants
of
half
a
regiment
and
had
fully
determined
that
it
should
not
be
wasted
the
kelly
girls
were
both
up
and
ready
to
do
anything
for
their
friend
so
they
got
her
to
take
a
little
of
sally
specific
and
put
her
into
a
warm
bed
to
sleep
quiet
and
secure
from
any
interruption
while
her
guest
was
sleeping
the
widow
made
up
her
mind
that
her
best
and
safest
course
for
the
present
would
be
as
she
expressed
it
to
her
daughter
meg
to
keep
her
toe
in
her
pump
and
say
nothing
to
nobody
anty
can
just
stay
quiet
and
asy
she
continued
till
we
see
what
master
barry
manes
to
be
afther
he
find
it
difficult
enough
to
move
her
out
of
this
i
thinking
and
i
doubt
his
trying
as
to
money
matthers
i
neither
meddle
nor
make
nor
will
you
mind
so
listen
to
that
girls
and
as
to
moylan
he
a
dacent
quiet
poor
man
but
it
bad
thrusting
any
one
av
he
her
agent
however
i
look
afther
the
estate
only
barry
be
smashing
the
things
up
there
at
the
house
yonder
in
his
anger
and
dhrunken
fits
and
it
a
pity
the
poor
girl
property
should
go
to
rack
but
he
such
a
born
divil
she
lucky
to
be
out
of
his
clutches
alive
though
thank
the
almighty
that
put
a
good
roof
over
the
lone
widow
this
day
he
clutch
her
here
would
i
like
to
see
him
come
to
the
door
and
ax
for
her
and
he
ca
smash
the
acres
nor
the
money
they
say
mulholland
has
at
tuam
and
faix
av
he
does
any
harm
up
there
at
the
house
shure
enough
anty
can
make
him
pay
for
it
every
pot
and
pan
of
it
out
of
his
share
and
she
do
it
too
av
she
said
by
me
but
mind
i
neither
meddle
nor
make
neither
do
you
and
then
we
safe
and
anty
too
and
martin
be
here
soon
i
wondher
what
good
do
him
they
might
have
the
repale
without
him
i
suppose
and
when
he
here
why
av
he
minded
to
marry
her
and
she
plased
why
father
geoghegan
may
come
down
and
do
it
before
the
whole
counthry
and
who
ashamed
but
there
be
no
and
schaming
that
is
av
they
said
by
me
faix
i
like
to
know
who
she
to
be
afeared
of
and
she
undher
this
roof
i
martin
ai
fool
enough
to
care
for
what
such
a
fellow
as
barry
lynch
can
do
or
say
and
he
with
all
the
kellys
to
back
him
as
shure
they
would
and
why
not
from
the
lord
down
not
that
i
recommend
the
match
i
think
martin
a
dale
betther
off
as
he
is
for
he
wanting
nothing
and
he
his
own
industhry
and
maybe
a
handful
of
money
besides
but
as
for
being
afeard
i
niver
heard
yet
that
a
kelly
need
be
afeard
of
a
lynch
in
dunmore
in
this
manner
did
mrs
kelly
express
the
various
thoughts
that
ran
through
her
head
as
she
considered
anty
affairs
and
if
we
could
analyse
the
good
lady
mind
we
should
probably
find
that
the
result
of
her
reflections
was
a
pleasing
assurance
that
she
could
exercise
the
christian
virtues
of
charity
and
hospitality
towards
anty
and
at
the
same
time
secure
her
son
wishes
and
welfare
without
subjecting
her
own
name
to
any
obloquy
or
putting
herself
to
any
loss
or
inconvenience
she
determined
to
put
no
questions
to
anty
nor
even
to
allude
to
her
brother
unless
spoken
to
on
the
subject
but
at
the
same
time
she
stoutly
resolved
to
come
to
no
terms
with
barry
and
to
defy
him
to
the
utmost
should
he
attempt
to
invade
her
in
her
own
territories
after
a
sound
sleep
anty
got
up
much
strengthened
and
refreshed
and
found
the
two
kelly
girls
ready
to
condole
with
or
congratulate
her
according
to
her
mood
and
spirits
in
spite
of
their
mother
caution
they
were
quite
prepared
for
gossiping
as
soon
as
anty
showed
the
slightest
inclination
that
way
and
though
she
at
first
was
afraid
to
talk
about
her
brother
and
was
even
from
kindly
feeling
unwilling
to
do
so
the
luxury
of
such
an
opportunity
of
unrestrained
confidence
overcame
her
and
before
the
three
had
been
sitting
together
for
a
couple
of
hours
she
had
described
the
whole
interview
as
well
as
the
last
drunken
midnight
visit
of
barry
to
her
own
which
to
her
imagination
was
the
most
horrible
of
all
the
horrors
of
the
night
poor
anty
she
cried
vehemently
that
morning
more
in
sorrow
for
her
brother
than
in
remembrance
of
her
own
fears
as
she
told
her
friends
how
he
had
threatened
to
shut
her
up
in
a
and
then
to
murder
her
unless
she
promised
him
not
to
marry
and
when
she
described
how
brutally
he
had
struck
her
and
how
afterwards
he
had
crept
to
her
room
with
his
red
eyes
and
swollen
face
in
the
dead
of
the
night
and
placing
his
hot
mouth
close
to
her
ears
had
dreadfully
sworn
that
she
should
die
if
she
thought
of
martin
kelly
as
her
husband
she
trembled
as
though
she
was
in
an
ague
fit
the
girls
said
all
they
could
to
comfort
her
and
they
succeeded
in
a
great
degree
but
they
could
not
bring
her
to
talk
of
martin
she
shuddered
whenever
his
name
was
mentioned
and
they
began
to
fear
that
barry
threat
would
have
the
intended
effect
and
frighten
her
from
the
match
however
they
kindly
talked
of
other
things
of
how
impossible
it
was
that
she
should
go
back
to
dunmore
house
and
how
comfortable
and
snug
they
would
make
her
at
the
inn
till
she
got
a
home
for
herself
of
what
she
should
do
and
of
all
their
little
household
plans
together
till
anty
when
she
could
forget
her
brother
threats
for
a
time
seemed
to
be
more
comfortable
and
happy
than
she
had
been
for
years
in
vain
did
the
widow
that
morning
repeatedly
invoke
meg
and
jane
first
one
and
then
the
other
to
assist
in
her
commercial
labours
in
vain
were
sally
and
kate
commissioned
to
bring
them
down
if
on
some
urgent
behest
one
of
them
darted
down
to
mix
a
dandy
of
punch
or
weigh
a
pound
of
sugar
when
the
widow
was
imperatively
employed
elsewhere
she
was
upstairs
again
before
her
mother
could
look
about
her
and
at
last
mrs
kelly
was
obliged
to
content
herself
with
the
reflection
that
girls
would
be
girls
and
that
it
was
nathural
and
right
they
should
wish
to
lave
anty
alone
the
first
morning
and
she
sthrange
to
the
place
at
five
the
widow
as
was
her
custom
went
up
to
her
dinner
and
meg
was
then
obliged
to
come
down
and
mind
the
shop
till
her
sister
having
dined
should
come
down
and
relieve
guard
she
had
only
just
ensconced
herself
behind
the
counter
when
who
should
walk
into
the
shop
but
barry
lynch
had
meg
seen
an
ogre
or
the
enemy
of
all
mankind
himself
she
could
not
at
the
moment
have
been
more
frightened
and
she
stood
staring
at
him
as
if
the
sudden
loss
of
the
power
of
motion
alone
prevented
her
from
running
away
i
want
to
see
mrs
kelly
said
barry
d
hear
i
want
to
see
your
mother
go
and
tell
her
but
we
must
go
back
and
see
how
mr
lynch
had
managed
to
get
up
and
pass
his
morning
vii
mr
barry
lynch
makes
a
morning
call
it
was
noon
before
barry
first
opened
his
eyes
and
discovered
the
reality
of
the
headache
which
the
night
miserable
and
solitary
debauch
had
entailed
on
him
for
in
spite
of
the
assurance
that
there
is
not
a
headache
in
a
hogshead
of
it
whiskey
punch
will
sicken
one
as
well
as
more
expensive
and
more
fashionable
potent
drinks
barry
was
very
sick
when
he
first
awoke
and
very
miserable
too
for
vague
recollections
of
what
he
had
done
and
doubtful
fears
of
what
he
might
have
done
crowded
on
him
a
drunken
man
always
feels
more
anxiety
about
what
he
has
not
done
in
his
drunkenness
than
about
what
he
has
and
so
it
was
with
barry
he
remembered
having
used
rough
language
with
his
sister
but
he
could
not
remember
how
far
he
had
gone
he
remembered
striking
her
and
he
knew
that
the
servant
had
come
in
but
he
could
not
remember
how
or
with
what
he
had
struck
her
or
whether
he
had
done
so
more
than
once
or
whether
she
had
been
much
hurt
he
could
not
even
think
whether
he
had
seen
her
since
or
not
he
remembered
being
in
the
garden
after
she
had
fallen
and
drinking
again
after
that
but
nothing
further
surely
he
could
not
have
killed
her
he
could
not
even
have
hurt
her
very
much
or
he
would
have
heard
of
it
before
this
if
anything
serious
had
happened
the
servants
would
have
taken
care
that
he
should
have
heard
enough
about
it
ere
now
then
he
began
to
think
what
it
could
be
and
that
it
must
be
late
for
his
watch
was
run
down
the
general
fate
of
drunkards
who
are
doomed
to
utter
ignorance
of
the
hour
at
which
they
wake
to
the
consciousness
of
their
miserable
disgrace
he
feared
to
ring
the
bell
for
the
servant
he
was
afraid
to
ask
the
particulars
of
last
night
work
so
he
turned
on
his
pillow
and
tried
to
sleep
again
but
in
vain
if
he
closed
his
eyes
anty
was
before
them
and
he
was
dreaming
half
awake
that
he
was
trying
to
stifle
her
and
that
she
was
escaping
to
tell
all
the
world
of
his
brutality
and
cruelty
this
happened
over
and
over
again
for
when
he
dozed
but
for
a
minute
the
same
thing
as
vividly
as
before
and
made
even
his
waking
consciousness
preferable
to
the
visions
of
his
disturbed
slumbers
so
at
last
he
roused
himself
and
endeavoured
to
think
what
he
should
do
whilst
he
was
sitting
up
in
his
bed
and
reflecting
that
he
must
undress
himself
before
he
could
dress
himself
for
he
had
tumbled
into
bed
with
most
of
his
clothes
on
terry
red
head
appeared
at
the
door
showing
an
anxiety
on
the
part
of
its
owner
to
see
if
the
masther
was
awake
but
to
take
no
step
to
bring
about
such
a
state
if
luckily
he
still
slept
what
the
time
terry
said
lynch
frightened
by
his
own
state
into
rather
more
courtesy
than
he
usually
displayed
to
those
dependent
on
him
well
then
i
it
past
one
yer
honer
the
d
l
it
is
i
such
a
headache
i
was
screwed
last
night
eh
terry
i
yer
war
yer
honer
what
was
it
when
i
went
to
bed
well
then
i
do
rightly
know
mr
barry
it
was
only
about
ten
when
i
tuk
in
the
last
hot
wather
and
i
did
see
yer
honer
afther
that
well
tell
miss
anty
to
make
me
a
cup
of
tea
and
do
you
bring
it
up
here
this
was
a
feeler
if
anything
was
the
matter
with
anty
terry
would
be
sure
to
tell
him
now
but
he
only
said
yis
yer
honer
and
retreated
barry
now
comforted
himself
with
the
reflection
that
there
was
no
great
harm
done
and
that
though
certainly
there
had
been
some
row
between
him
and
anty
it
would
probably
blow
over
and
then
also
he
began
to
reflect
that
perhaps
what
he
had
said
and
done
would
frighten
her
out
of
her
match
with
kelly
in
the
meantime
terry
went
into
the
kitchen
with
the
news
that
masther
was
awake
and
axing
for
tay
biddy
had
considered
herself
entitled
to
remain
all
the
morning
at
the
inn
having
in
a
manner
earned
a
right
to
be
idle
for
that
day
by
her
activity
during
the
night
and
the
other
girl
had
endeavoured
to
enjoy
the
same
luxury
for
she
had
been
found
once
or
twice
during
the
morning
ensconced
in
the
kitchen
under
sally
wing
but
mrs
kelly
had
hunted
her
back
to
go
and
wait
on
her
master
giving
her
to
understand
that
she
would
not
receive
the
whole
household
and
ye
afther
telling
him
where
miss
anty
gone
terry
inquired
the
injured
fair
one
divil
a
tell
for
me
thin
shure
he
may
find
it
out
hisself
widout
my
telling
him
faix
it
he
be
mad
thin
when
he
finds
she
taken
up
with
the
likes
of
the
widdy
kelly
and
ai
she
betther
there
nor
being
murthered
up
here
he
be
killing
her
out
and
out
some
night
well
but
terry
he
not
so
bad
as
all
that
there
worse
than
him
and
ai
it
rasonable
he
should
be
quiet
and
asy
and
she
taking
up
with
the
likes
of
martin
kelly
may
be
so
but
would
she
be
a
dale
happier
with
martin
than
up
here
wid
him
any
ways
it
do
do
angering
him
so
get
him
the
tay
judy
it
was
soon
found
that
this
was
easier
said
than
done
for
anty
in
her
confusion
had
taken
away
the
keys
in
her
pocket
and
there
was
no
tea
to
be
had
the
bell
was
now
rung
and
as
barry
had
gradually
himself
rung
violently
and
terry
when
he
arrived
distracted
at
the
door
was
angrily
asked
by
his
thirsty
master
why
the
tea
appear
the
truth
was
now
obliged
to
come
out
or
at
any
rate
part
of
it
so
terry
answered
that
miss
anty
was
out
and
had
the
keys
with
her
miss
anty
was
so
rarely
out
that
barry
instantly
trembled
again
had
she
gone
to
a
magistrate
to
swear
against
him
had
she
run
away
from
him
had
she
gone
off
with
martin
where
the
d

gone
terry
said
he
in
his
extremity
faix
yer

thin
i
not
rightly
knowing
but
i
hear
tell
down
at
the
widow
kelly
who
told
you
you
fool
well
thin
yer
honer
it
war
judy
and
where
judy
and
it
ended
in
judy
being
produced
and
the
two
of
them
at
length
explained
to
their
master
that
the
widow
had
come
up
early
in
the
morning
and
fetched
her
away
and
judy
swore
that
not
a
know
she
knowed
how
it
had
come
about
or
what
had
induced
the
widow
to
come
or
miss
anty
to
go
or
anything
about
it
only
for
shure
miss
anty
was
down
there
snug
enough
with
miss
jane
and
miss
meg
and
the
widdy
war
in
her
tantrums
and
would
let
ony
dacent
person
inside
the
barring
biddy
and
that
wor
all
she
knowed
av
she
wor
on
the
book
the
secret
was
now
out
anty
had
left
him
and
put
herself
under
the
protection
of
martin
kelly
mother
had
absolutely
defied
him
after
all
his
threats
of
the
preceding
night
what
should
he
do
now
all
his
hatred
for
her
returned
again
all
his
anxious
wishes
that
she
might
be
somehow
removed
from
his
path
as
an
obnoxious
a
few
minutes
ago
he
was
afraid
he
had
murdered
her
and
he
now
almost
wished
that
he
had
done
so
he
finished
dressing
himself
and
then
sat
down
in
the
parlour
which
had
been
the
scene
of
his
last
brutality
to
concoct
fresh
schemes
for
the
persecution
of
his
sister
in
the
meantime
terry
rushed
down
to
the
inn
demanding
the
keys
and
giving
mrs
kelly
a
fearful
history
of
his
master
anger
this
she
very
wisely
refrained
from
retailing
but
having
procured
the
keys
gave
them
to
the
messenger
merely
informing
him
that
thanks
to
god
kind
protection
miss
anty
was
tolerably
well
over
the
last
night
work
and
he
might
tell
his
master
so
this
message
terry
thought
it
wisest
to
suppress
so
he
took
the
breakfast
up
in
silence
and
his
master
asked
no
more
questions
he
was
very
sick
and
pale
and
could
eat
nothing
but
he
drank
a
quantity
of
tea
and
a
couple
of
glasses
of
and
then
he
felt
better
and
again
began
to
think
what
measures
he
should
take
what
scheme
he
could
concoct
for
stopping
this
horrid
marriage
and
making
his
sister
obedient
to
his
wishes
confound
her
he
said
almost
aloud
as
he
thought
with
bitter
vexation
of
spirit
of
her
unincumbered
moiety
of
the
property
confound
them
all
grinding
his
teeth
and
meaning
by
the
all
to
include
with
anty
his
father
and
every
one
who
might
have
assisted
his
father
in
making
the
odious
will
as
well
as
his
own
attorney
in
tuam
who
would
find
out
some
legal
expedient
by
which
he
could
set
it
aside
and
then
as
he
thought
of
the
shameful
persecution
of
which
he
was
the
victim
he
kicked
the
fender
with
impotent
violence
and
as
the
noise
of
the
falling
fire
irons
added
to
his
passion
he
reiterated
his
kicks
till
the
unoffending
piece
of
furniture
was
smashed
and
then
with
manly
indignation
he
turned
away
to
the
window
but
breaking
the
furniture
though
it
was
what
the
widow
predicted
of
him
would
in
any
way
mend
matters
or
assist
him
in
getting
out
of
his
difficulties
what
was
he
to
do
he
could
live
on
he
could
remain
in
dunmore
to
be
known
by
every
one
as
martin
kelly
he
could
endure
the
thoughts
of
dividing
the
property
with
such
a
huxtering
blackguard
as
he
called
him
over
and
over
again
he
could
stay
there
to
be
beaten
by
him
in
the
course
of
legal
proceedings
or
to
give
him
up
amicable
possession
of
what
ought
to
have
been
what
should
have
been
his
what
he
looked
upon
as
his
own
he
came
back
and
sat
down
again
over
the
fire
contemplating
the
debris
of
the
fender
and
turning
all
these
miserable
circumstances
over
in
his
mind
after
remaining
there
till
five
and
having
fortified
himself
with
sundry
glasses
of
wine
he
formed
his
resolution
he
would
make
one
struggle
more
he
would
first
go
down
to
the
widow
and
claim
his
sister
as
a
poor
simple
young
woman
inveigled
away
from
her
natural
guardian
and
if
this
were
unsuccessful
as
he
felt
pretty
sure
it
would
be
he
would
take
proceedings
to
prove
her
a
lunatic
if
he
failed
he
might
still
delay
and
finally
put
off
the
marriage
and
he
was
sure
he
could
get
some
attorney
to
put
him
in
the
way
of
doing
it
and
to
undertake
the
work
for
him
his
late
father
attorney
had
been
a
fool
in
not
breaking
the
will
or
at
any
rate
trying
it
and
he
would
go
to
daly
young
daly
he
knew
was
a
sharp
fellow
and
wanted
practice
and
this
would
just
suit
him
and
then
if
at
last
he
found
that
nothing
could
be
done
by
this
means
if
his
sister
and
the
property
go
from
him
he
would
compromise
the
matter
with
the
bridegroom
he
would
meet
him
half
way
and
raising
what
money
he
could
on
his
share
of
the
estate
give
leg
bail
to
his
creditors
and
go
to
some
place
abroad
where
tidings
of
dunmore
would
never
reach
him
what
did
it
matter
what
people
said
he
should
never
hear
it
he
would
make
over
the
whole
property
to
kelly
on
getting
a
good
life
income
out
of
it
martin
was
a
prudent
fellow
and
would
jump
at
such
a
plan
as
he
thought
of
this
he
even
began
to
wish
that
it
was
done
he
pictured
to
himself
the
easy
pleasures
the
the
and
cafés
of
some
calais
or
boulogne
pleasures
which
he
had
never
known
but
which
had
been
so
glowingly
described
to
him
and
he
got
almost
cheerful
again
as
he
felt
that
in
any
way
there
might
be
bright
days
yet
in
store
for
him
he
would
however
still
make
the
last
effort
for
the
whole
stake
it
would
be
time
enough
to
give
in
and
make
the
best
of
a
when
he
was
forced
to
do
so
if
beaten
he
would
make
use
of
martin
kelly
but
he
would
first
try
if
he
could
prove
him
to
be
a
swindling
adventurer
and
his
sister
to
be
an
idiot
footnote
pis
aller
french
last
resort
much
satisfied
at
having
come
to
this
salutary
resolution
he
took
up
his
hat
and
set
out
for
the
widow
in
order
to
put
into
operation
the
first
part
of
the
scheme
he
rather
wished
it
over
as
he
knew
that
mrs
kelly
was
no
coward
and
had
a
strong
tongue
in
her
head
however
it
must
be
done
and
the
sooner
the
better
he
first
of
all
looked
at
himself
in
his
glass
to
see
that
his
appearance
was
sufficiently
haughty
and
indignant
and
as
he
flattered
himself
like
that
of
a
gentleman
singularly
out
of
his
element
in
such
a
village
as
dunmore
and
then
having
ordered
his
dinner
to
be
ready
on
his
return
he
proceeded
on
his
voyage
for
the
recovery
of
his
dear
sister
entering
the
shop
he
communicated
his
wishes
to
meg
in
the
manner
before
described
and
while
she
was
gone
on
her
errand
he
remained
alone
there
lashing
his
boot
in
the
most
approved
but
still
in
a
very
manner
oh
mother
said
meg
rushing
into
the
room
where
her
mother
and
jane
and
anty
were
at
dinner

pale
and
dropped
her
knife
and
fork
i

said

old

my
mind
set
down
quiet
meg
and
get
your
dinner
and
the
widow
got
up
and
proceeded
to
the
shop
the
girls
were
all
in
commotion
one
went
to
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
to
overhear
as
much
as
possible
of
what
was
to
take
place
and
the
other
clasped
anty
hand
to
her
having
first
thrown
open
the
door
of
one
of
the
that
she
might
have
a
place
of
retreat
in
the
event
of
the
enemy
succeeding
in
pushing
his
way
upstairs
your
humble
sarvant
mr
lynch
said
the
widow
entering
the
shop
and
immediately
taking
up
a
position
of
strength
in
her
accustomed
place
behind
the
counter
were
you
wanting
me
this
evening
and
she
took
up
the
knife
with
which
she
cut
of
tobacco
for
her
customers
and
hitting
the
counter
with
its
wooden
handle
looked
as
hard
as
copper
and
as
bold
as
brass
yes
mrs
kelly
said
barry
with
as
much
dignity
as
he
could
muster
i
do
want
to
speak
to
you

sister
has
foolishly
left
her
home
this
morning
and
my
servants
tell
me

is
under
your
roof
is
this
true
is
it
anty
indeed
she
is
thin
ating
her
dinner
upstairs
this
very
moment
and
she
rapped
the
counter
again
and
looked
her
foe
in
the
face
then
with
your
leave
mrs
kelly
i
step
up
and
speak
to
her
i
suppose
she
alone
indeed
she
ai
thin
for
she
the
two
girls
ating
wid
her
and
myself
too
barring
that
i
just
come
down
at
your
bidding
no
not
so
bad
as
that
to
lave
her
all
alone
and
as
for
your
seeing
her
mr
lynch
i
do
think
she
exactly
wishing
it
at
present
so
you
a
message
i
take
it
you
do
mean
to
say
that
miss
lynch
my
sister
is
in
this
inn
and
that
you
intend
to
prevent
my
seeing
her
you
better
take
care
what
you
doing
mrs
kelly
i
do
want
to
say
anything
harsh
at
present
but
you
better
take
care
what
you
about
with
me
and
my
family
or
you
find
yourself
in
a
scrape
that
you
little
bargain
for
i
take
care
of
myself
mr
barry
never
fear
for
me
darling
and
what
more
i
take
care
of
your
sister
too
and
to
give
you
a
bit
of
my
mind
she
want
my
care
i
thinking
while
you
in
the
counthry
i
not
come
here
to
listen
to
impertinence
mrs
kelly
and
i
will
not
do
so
in
fact
it
is
very
unwillingly
that
i
came
into
this
house
at
all
oh
pray
lave
it
thin
pray
lave
it
we
can
do
without
you
perhaps
you
will
have
the
civility
to
listen
to
me
it
is
very
unwillingly
i
say
that
i
have
come
here
at
all
but
my
sister
who
is
unfortunately
not
able
to
judge
for
herself
is
here
how
she
came
here
i
do
pretend
to
say
oh
she
walked
said
the
widow
interrupting
him
she
walked
quiet
and
asy
out
of
your
door
and
into
mine
but
that
a
lie
for
it
was
out
of
her
own
she
did
come
through
the
nor
yet
out
of
the
window
i
saying
nothing
about
how
she
came
here
but
here
she
is
poor
creature
poor
crature
indeed
she
was
like
to
be
a
poor
crature
av
she
stayed
up
there
much
longer
here
she
is
i
say
and
i
consider
it
my
duty
to
look
after
her
you
can
not
but
be
aware
mrs
kelly
that
this
is
not
a
fit
place
for
miss
lynch
you
must
be
aware
that
a
however
decent
or
a
village
shop
however
respectable
is
not
the
proper
place
for
my
sister
and
though
i
may
not
yet
be
legally
her
guardian
i
am
her
brother
and
am
in
charge
of
her
property
and
i
insist
on
seeing
her
it
will
be
at
your
peril
if
you
prevent
me
have
you
done
now
misther
barry
that
what
i
got
to
say
and
i
think
you
sense
enough
to
see
the
folly
not
to
speak
of
the
danger
of
preventing
me
from
seeing
my
sister
that
your
say
misther
lynch
and
now
listen
to
mine
av
miss
anty
was
wishing
to
see
you
you
be
welcome
upstairs
for
her
sake
but
she
ai
so
there
an
end
of
that
for
not
a
foot
will
you
put
inside
this
unless
you
intending
to
force
your
way
and
i
think
you
be
for
trying
that
and
as
to
bearing
the
danger
why
i
do
my
best
and
for
all
the
harm
you
likely
to
do
me
by
fair
manes
i
do
think
i
be
axing
any
one
to
help
me
out
of
it
so
good
bye
t
ye
av
you
no
further
commands
for
i
yet
well
finish
the
bit
i
was
ating
and
you
mean
to
say
mrs
kelly
you
take
upon
yourself
to
prevent
my
seeing
my
sister
indeed
i
do
unless
she
was
wishing
it
as
well
as
yourself
and
no
mistake
and
you
do
that
knowing
as
you
do
that
the
unfortunate
young
woman
is
of
weak
mind
and
unable
to
judge
for
herself
and
that
her
brother
and
her
only
living
relative
and
guardian
all
blathershin
masther
barry
said
the
uncourteous
widow
dropping
the
knife
from
her
hand
and
smacking
her
fingers
as
for
wake
mind
it
sthrong
enough
to
take
good
care
of
herself
and
her
money
too
now
she
once
out
of
dunmore
house
there
many
waker
than
anty
lynch
though
few
have
had
worse
tratement
to
make
them
so
as
for
guardian
i
thinking
it
long
since
she
was
of
age
and
av
her
father
did
think
she
wanted
one
when
he
made
his
will
you
need
bother
yourself
about
it
now
she
no
one
to
plaze
only
herself
and
as
for
brother
masther
barry
why
did
you
think
of
that
before
you
struck
her
like
a
brute
as
you
are
before
you
got
dhrunk
like
a
baste
and
then
threatened
to
murdher
her
why
did
you
think
about
brother
and
sisther
before
you
thried
to
rob
the
poor
crature
as
you
call
her
and
when
you
found
she
was
quite
wake
enough
as
you
call
it
swore
to
have
her
life
av
she
would
act
at
your
bidding
being
a
brother
and
a
guardian
is
it
masther
barry
talk
to
me
of
danger
you
ruffian
continued
the
widow
with
her
back
now
thoroughly
up
you
betther
look
to
yourself
or
i
know
who
be
in
most
danger
av
it
was
the
throuble
it
be
to
anty
and
god
knows
she
had
throubles
enough
i
have
had
her
before
the
magisthrates
before
this
to
tell
of
what
was
done
last
night
up
at
the
house
yonder
but
mind
she
can
do
it
yet
and
av
you
do
take
yourself
very
asy
she
shall
danger
indeed
a
robber
and
ruffian
like
you
to
talk
of
danger
to
me
and
his
sisther
too
and
aftimer
trying
his
best
last
night
to
murdher
her
these
last
words
with
a
long
drawl
on
the
word
were
addressed
rather
to
the
crowd
whom
the
widow
loud
voice
had
attracted
into
the
open
shop
than
to
barry
who
stood
during
this
tirade
half
stupefied
with
rage
and
half
frightened
at
the
open
attack
made
on
him
with
reference
to

she
turned
round
to
the
listening
crowd
for
sympathy
which
those
who
dared
were
not
slow
in
giving
her
and
that
thrue
for
you
mrs
kelly
exclaimed
one
it
a
shame
for
him
to
come
storming
here
agin
a
lone
widdy
so
it
is
said
a
virago
who
seemed
well
able
like
the
widow
herself
to
take
her
own
part
who
iver
knew
any
good
of
a
lynch
barring
miss
anty
herself
argued
a
third
the
kellys
is
always
too
good
for
the
likes
of

put
in
a
fourth
presuming
that
the
intended

in

mr

said
the
widow
who
was
well
pleased
to
have
her
son
name
mentioned
in
the
affair
it
no
business
of
his
one
way
or
another
he
ai
in

it
miss
anty

has
come
to
me
for
protection
and
by
the
blessed
virgin
she
shall
have
it
as
long
as
my
name
mary
kelly
and
i
ai
like
to
change
it
so
that
the
long
and
short
of
it
barry

so
you

go

think
either
on
more
than
a
match
for
you
then
i
tell
you
mrs
kelly
replied
barry
who
was
hardly
able
to
get
in
a
word
that
you
hear
more
about
it
steps
are
now
being
taken
to
prove
miss
lynch
a
lunatic
as
every
one
here
knows
she
unfortunately
is
and
as
sure
as
you
stand
there
you
have
to
answer
for
detaining
her
and
you
much
mistaken
if
you
think
get
hold
of
her
property
even
though
she
were
to
marry
your
son
for
i
warn
you
she
not
her
own
mistress
or
able
to
be
so
drat
your
impudence
you
ruffian
answered
his
opponent
who
cares
for
her
money
it
not
come
to
that
yet
that
a
kelly
is
wanting
to
schame
money
out
of
a
lynch
i
nothing
more
to
say
since
you
insist
on
keeping
possession
of
my
sister
and
barry
turned
to
the
door
but
you
be
indicted
for
conspiracy
so
you
better
be
prepared
conspiracy
is
it
said
one
of
mrs
kelly
admirers
maybe
he
get
you
put
in
along
with
dan
and
father
tierney
god
bless
them
it
conspiracy
they
afore
the
judges
for
barry
now
took
himself
off
before
hearing
the
last
of
the
final
peal
of
thunder
get
out
wid
you
you
no
good
and
never
will
be
an
it
was
for
the
young
woman
upstairs
i
have
the
coat
off
your
back
and
your
face
well
mauled
before
i
let
you
out
of
the
shop
and
so
ended
the
interview
in
which
the
anxious
brother
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
been
triumphant
or
successful
the
widow
on
the
other
hand
seemed
to
feel
that
she
had
acquitted
herself
well
and
that
she
had
taken
the
orphan
part
like
a
woman
a
christian
and
a
mother
and
merely
saying
with
a
kind
of
inward
chuckle
come
to
me
indeed
with
his
roguery
he
got
the
wrong
pig
by
the
ear
she
walked
off
to
join
the
more
timid
trio
upstairs
one
of
whom
was
speedily
sent
down
to
see
that
business
did
not
go
astray
and
then
she
gave
a
long
account
of
the
interview
to
anty
and
meg
which
was
hardly
necessary
as
they
had
heard
most
of
what
had
passed
the
widow
however
was
not
to
know
that
and
she
was
very
voluble
in
her
description
of
barry
insolence
and
of
the
dreadfully
abusive
things
he
had
said
to
her
how
he
had
given
her
the
lie
and
called
her
out
of
her
name
she
did
not
however
seem
to
be
aware
that
she
had
herself
said
a
word
which
was
more
than
necessarily
violent
and
assured
anty
over
and
over
again
that
out
of
respect
to
her
feelings
and
because
the
man
was
after
all
her
brother
she
had
refrained
from
doing
and
saying
what
she
would
have
done
and
said
had
she
been
treated
in
such
a
manner
by
anybody
else
she
seemed
however
in
spite
of
the
which
she
had
undergone
to
be
in
a
serene
and
happy
state
of
mind
she
shook
anty
two
hands
in
hers
and
told
her
to
make
herself
snug
and
asy
where
she
was
like
a
dear
girl
and
to
fret
for
nothing
for
no
one
could
hurt
or
harum
her
and
she
undher
mary
kelly
roof
then
she
wiped
her
face
in
her
apron
set
to
at
her
dinner
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
drink
a
glass
of
porter
a
thing
she
had
done
except
on
a
sunday
since
her
eldest
daughter
marriage
barry
lynch
sneaked
up
the
town
like
a
beaten
dog
he
felt
that
the
widow
had
had
the
best
of
it
and
he
also
felt
that
every
one
in
dunmore
was
against
him
it
was
however
only
what
he
had
expected
and
calculated
upon
and
what
should
he
care
for
the
dunmore
people
they
would
rise
up
and
kill
him
nor
would
they
be
likely
even
to
injure
him
let
them
hate
on
he
would
follow
his
own
plan
as
he
came
near
the
house
gate
there
was
sitting
as
usual
jacky
the
fool
well
yer
honer

said

masther
barry
barry
looked
round
for
something
wherewith
to
avenge
himself
for
this
but
jacky
was
out
of
his
reach
so
he
merely
muttered
some
customary
but
inaudible
curses
and
turned
into
the
house
he
immediately
took
pen
ink
and
paper
and
writing
the
following
note
dispatched
it
to
tuam
by
terry
mounted
for
the
occasion
and
directed
on
no
account
to
return
without
an
answer
if
mr
daly
at
home
he
was
to
wait
for
his
return
that
is
if
he
was
expected
home
that
night
dunmore
house
my
dear
sir
i
wish
to
consult
you
on
legal
business
which
will
no
the
subject
is
of
considerable
importance
and
i
am
induced
to
think
it
will
be
more
ably
handled
by
you
than
by
mr
blake
my
father
man
of
business
there
is
a
bed
at
your
service
at
dunmore
house
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
to
dinner
i
am
dear
sir
your
faithful
servant
barry
lynch
you
had
better
not
mention
in
tuam
that
you
are
coming
to
me
not
that
my
business
is
one
that
i
intend
to
keep
secret
daly
solicitor
tuam
in
about
two
hours
time
terry
had
put
the
above
into
the
hands
of
the
person
for
whom
it
was
intended
and
in
two
more
he
had
brought
back
an
answer
saying
that
mr
daly
would
be
at
dunmore
house
to
dinner
on
the
following
day
and
terry
on
his
journey
there
and
back
did
not
forget
to
tell
everyone
he
saw
from
whom
he
came
and
to
whom
he
was
going
viii
mr
martin
kelly
returns
to
dunmore
we
will
now
return
to
martin
kelly
i
have
before
said
that
as
soon
as
he
had
completed
his
legal
business
namely
his
instructions
for
the
settlement
of
anty
lynch
property
respecting
which
he
and
lord
ballindine
had
been
together
to
the
lawyer
in
clare
street
he
started
for
home
by
the
ballinasloe
and
reached
that
famous
depôt
of
the
fleecy
tribe
without
adventure
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
the
tedium
of
that
horrid
voyage
for
it
has
been
often
described
before
and
to
martin
who
was
in
no
ways
fastidious
it
was
not
so
unendurable
as
it
must
always
be
to
those
who
have
been
accustomed
to
more
rapid
movement
nor
yet
will
i
attempt
to
put
on
record
the
miserable
resources
of
those
who
doomed
to
a
twenty
sojourn
in
one
of
these
floating
prisons
vainly
endeavour
to
occupy
or
amuse
their
minds
but
i
will
advise
any
who
from
arrangements
or
unforeseen
misfortune
may
find
themselves
on
board
the
ballinasloe
to
entertain
no
such
vain
dream
the
of
patient
endurance
is
the
only
weapon
of
any
use
in
attempting
to
overcome
the
lengthened
ennui
of
this
most
tedious
transit
reading
is
out
of
the
question
i
have
tried
it
myself
and
seen
others
try
it
but
in
vain

sense
of
the
motion
almost
imperceptible
but
still
perceptible
the
noises
above
you
the
smells
around
you
the
diversified
crowd
of
which
you
are
a
part
at
one
moment
the
heat
this
crowd
creates
at
the
next
the
draught
which
a
window
just
opened
behind
your
ears
lets
in
on
you
the
fumes
of
punch
the
snores
of
the
man
under
the
table
the
noisy
anger
of
his
neighbour
who
reviles
the
attendant
sylph
the
witticisms
of
a
third
who
makes
continual
amorous
overtures
to
the
same
overtasked
damsel
notwithstanding
the
publicity
of
his
situation
the
loud
complaints
of
the
old
lady
near
the
door
who
can
not
obtain
the
gratuitous
kindness
of
a
glass
of
water
and
the
lullabies
of
the
young
one
who
is
suckling
her
infant
under
your
elbow
these
things
alike
prevent
one
from
reading
sleeping
or
thinking
all
one
can
do
is
to
wait
till
the
long
night
gradually
wears
itself
away
and
reflect
that
time
and
the
hour
run
through
the
longest

the

erroneous

he
travelled
by

on
giving
his

mr

who
made
no
objection
to
the
proposal
and
he
also
throwing
a
somewhat
diminutive
into

well
placed
himself
alongside

they
proceeded
on
their
journey
with
the
most
amicable
feelings
towards
each
other
they
little
guessed
either
the
one
or
the
other
as
they
commenced
talking
on

now
subject
of
the
great
trial
that
they
were
going
to
dunmore
for
the
express
object
though
not
with
the
expressed
purpose
of
opposing
each
other

daly
was
to
be
employed
to
suggest
any
legal
means
for
robbing
martin
of
a
wife
and
anty
of
her
property
and
that
martin
was
going
home
with
the
fixed
determination
of
effecting
a
wedding
to
prevent
which
his
companion
was
in
consideration
of
liberal
payment
to
use
all
his
ingenuity
and
energy
when
they
had
discussed
and
his
companions
and
their
chances
of
liberation
for
four
or
five
miles
and
when
martin
had
warmly
expressed
his
assurance
that
no
jury
could
convict
the
saviours
of
their
country
and
daly
had
given
utterance
to
his
legal
opinion
that
saltpetre
could
save
them
from
two
years

martin
asked
his
companion
whether
he
was
going
beyond
dunmore

night
no
indeed

replied

joy
of
your
new
client
i
not
over
fond
of
him
myself
i
own
but
then
there
were
always
rasons
why
he
and
i
should
pull
well
together
barry
always
been
a
dale
too
high
for
me
since
he
was
at
school
with
the
young
lord
well
good
evening
mr
daly
never
mind
time
car
coming
down
the
street
as
you
at
your
friend
gate
and
martin
took
his
bag
on
his
arm
and
walked
down
to
the
inn
though
martin
could
guess
as
he
walked
quickly
down
the
street
what
barry
lynch
could
want
with
young
daly
who
was
beginning
to
be
known
as
a
clever
though
not
practitioner
he
felt
a
presentiment
that
it
must
have
some
reference
to
anty
and
himself
and
this
made
him
rather
uncomfortable
could
barry
have
heard
of
his
engagement
had
anty
repented
of
her
bargain
during
his
short
absence
had
that
old
reptile
moylan
played
him
false
and
spoilt
his
game
that
must
be
it
said
martin
to
himself
and
it
odd
but
i
be
even
with
the
schamer
yet
only
she
so
asy
frightened
av
the
laist
pluck
in
life
it
little
i
care
for
moylan
or
barry
either
this
little
soliloquy
brought
him
to
the
inn
door
some
of
the
tribe
of
loungers
who
were
always
hanging
about
the
door
and
whom
in
her
hatred
of
idleness
the
widow
would
one
day
rout
from
the
place
and
in
her
charity
feed
the
next
had
seen
martin
coming
down
the
street
and
had
given
intelligence
in
the
kitchen
as
he
walked
in
therefore
at
the
open
door
meg
and
jane
were
ready
to
receive
him
in
the
passage
their
looks
were
big
with
some
important
news
martin
soon
saw
that
they
had
something
to
tell
well
girls
he
said
as
he
chucked
his
bag
and
coat
to
sally
for
heaven
sake

me
something

ate
for
i
starved

how

ould
lady
and
he
stepped
on
as
if
to
pass
by
them
upstairs

a
moment
martin
said
meg
do

in
a
hurry
there

one
there
who
there
is
it

stranger

anty
in
the
parlour
in
the
parlour
upstairs
said
he
the
deuce
she

and
what
brought
her
here
did
she
quarrel
with
barry
meg
added
he
in
a
whisper
indeed
she
did
out
and
out
said
meg
oh
he
used
her
horrible
said
jane
he
hear

about

by
and
by
said
meg
come
up
and
see
her
now
martin
but
does
mother
know
she
here
why
it
was
she
brought
her
here
she
fetched
her
down
from
the
house
yesterday
before
we
was
up
thus
assured
that
anty
had
not
been
smuggled
upstairs
her
lover
or
suitor
as
he
might
perhaps
be
more
confidently
called
proceeded
to
visit
her
if
he
wished
her
to
believe
that
his
first
impulse
on
hearing
of
her
being
in
the
house
had
been
to
throw
himself
at
her
feet
it
would
have
been
well
that
this
conversation
should
have
been
carried
on
out
of
her
hearing
but
anty
was
not
an
exigent
mistress
and
was
perfectly
contented
that
as
much
of
her
recent
history
as
possible
should
be
explained
before
martin
presented
himself
martin
went
slowly
upstairs
and
paused
a
moment
at
the
door
as
if
he
was
a
little
afraid
of
commencing
the
interview
he
looked
round
to
his
sisters
and
made
a
sign
to
them
to
come
in
with
him
and
then
quickly
pushing
open
the
unfastened
door
walked
briskly
up
to
anty
and
shook
hands
with
her
i
hope
you
very
well
anty
said
he
seeing
you
here
is
what
i
did
expect
but
i
very
glad
you
come
down
thank
ye
martin
replied
she
it
was
very
good
of
your
mother
fetching
me
she
been
the
best
friend
i
had
many
a
day
begad
it
a
fine
thing
to
see
you
and
the
ould
lady
pull
so
well
together
it
was
yesterday
you
came
here
yesterday
morning
i
was
so
glad
to
come
i
do
know
what
been
saying
to
barry
but
the
night
before
last
he
got
drinking
and
then
he
was
very
bad
to
me
and
tried
to
frighten
me
and
so
you
see
i
come
down
to
your
mother
till
we
could
be
friends
again
anty
apology
for
being
at
the
inn
was
perhaps
unnecessary
but
with
the
feeling
so
natural
to
a
woman
she
was
half
afraid
that
martin
would
fancy
she
had
run
after
him
and
she
therefore
thought
it
as
well
to
tell
him
that
it
was
only
a
temporary
measure
poor
anty
at
the
moment
she
said
so
she
trembled
at
the
very
idea
of
putting
herself
again
in
her
brother
power
frinds
indeed
said
meg
how
can
you
iver
be
frinds
with
the
like
of
him
what
nonsense
you
talk
anty
why
martin
he
was
like
to
murdher
her
he
raised
his
fist
to
her
and
knocked
her
down
and
afther
that
swore
to
her
he
kill
her
outright
av
she
would
sware
that
she
niver
whist
meg
how
can
you
go
on
that
way
said
anty
interrupting
her
and
blushing
i
not
stop
in
the
room
do
you
know
he
was
dhrunk
when
he
done
all
that
and
wo
he
be
dhrunk
again
anty
suggested
jane
shure
he
will
he
be
dhrunk
always
now
he
once
begun
replied
meg
who
of
all
the
family
was
the
most
anxious
to
push
her
suit
and
who
though
really
fond
of
her
friend
thought
the
present
opportunity
a
great
deal
too
good
to
be
thrown
away
and
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
anty
even
thinking
of
being
reconciled
to
her
brother
wo
he
be
always
dhrunk
now
she
continued
and
ai
we
all
frinds
here
and
why
should
you
let
me
tell
martin
all
afther
all
said
and
done
is
he
the
best
frind
you
got
here
anty
blushed
very
red
and
to
tell
the
truth
so
did
martin
too
well
so
he
is
and
unless
you
tell
him
what
happened
how
he
to
know
what
to
advise
and
to
tell
the
truth
would
you
sooner
do
what
he
says
than
any
one
else
i
sure
i
very
much
obliged
to
mr
martin
it
had
been
plain
martin
before
meg
appeal
but
your
mother
knows
what
best
for
me
and
i
do
whatever
she
says
av
it
had
been
for
her
i
do
know
where
i
be
now
but
you
need
quarrel
with
martin
because
you
frinds
with
mother
answered
meg
nonsense
meg
said
jane
anty
not
going
to
quarrel
with
him
you
hurry
her
too
much
martin
looked
rather
stupid
all
this
time
but
he
plucked
up
courage
and
said
who
going
to
quarrel
i
shure
anty
you
and
i
wo
but
whatever
it
is
barry
did
to
you
i
hope
you
wo
go
back
there
again
now
you
once
here
but
did
he
railly
sthrike
you
in
arnest
he
did
and
knocked
her
down
said
jane
but
wo
you
get
your
brother
his
dinner
said
anty
he
must
be
very
hungry
afther
his
ride
and
wo
you
see
your
mother
afther
your
journey
mr
martin
i
shure
she
expecting
you
this
for
the
present
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
the
girls
went
to
get
something
for
their
brother
to
eat
and
he
descended
into
the
lower
regions
to
pay
his
filial
respects
to
his
mother
a
considerable
time
passed
before
martin
returned
to
the
meal
the
three
young
women
had
provided
for
him
during
which
he
was
in
close
consultation
with
the
widow
in
the
first
place
she
began
upbraiding
him
for
his
folly
in
wishing
to
marry
an
old
maid
for
her
money
she
then
taxed
him
with
villany
for
trying
to
cheat
anty
out
of
her
property
and
when
he
defended
himself
from
that
charge
by
telling
her
what
he
had
done
about
the
settlement
she
asked
him
how
much
he
had
to
pay
the
rogue
of
a
lawyer
for
that
gander
job
she
then
proceeded
to
point
out
all
the
difficulties
which
lay
in
the
way
of
a
marriage
between
him
martin
and
her
anty
and
showed
how
mad
it
was
for
either
of
them
to
think
about
it
from
that
she
got
into
a
narrative
of
barry
conduct
and
anty
sufferings
neither
of
which
lost
anything
in
the
telling
and
having
by
this
time
gossiped
herself
into
a
good
humour
she
proceeded
to
show
how
through
her
means
and
assistance
the
marriage
might
take
place
if
he
was
still
bent
upon
it
she
eschewed
all
running
away
and
would
hear
of
no
clandestine
proceedings
they
should
be
married
in
the
face
of
day
as
the
kellys
ought
with
all
their
friends
round
them
they
have
no
work
up
in
a
corner
not
they
indeed
why
should
they
for
fear
of
barry
lynch
who
cared
for
a
dhrunken
blackguard
like
that
not
she
indeed
who
ever
heard
of
a
kelly
being
afraid
of
a
lynch
they
ax
him
to
come
and
see
his
sister
married
and
av
he
did
like
it
he
might
do
the
other
thing
and
so
the
widow
got
quite
eloquent
on
the
glories
of
the
wedding
and
the
enormities
of
her
son
future
who
had
she
assured
martin
come
down
and
abused
her
horribly
in
her
own
shop
before
all
the
town
because
she
allowed
anty
to
stay
in
the
house
she
then
proceeded
to
the
consequences
of
the
marriage
and
expressed
her
hope
that
when
martin
got
all
that
ready
money
he
would
do
something
for
his
poor
sisthers
for
heaven
knew
they
war
like
to
be
bad
enough
off
for
all
she
be
able
to
do
for
them
from
this
she
got
to
own
future
mode
of
life
suggesting
a
small
snug
cottage
on
the
farm
just
big
enough
for
them
two
and
a
slip
of
a
girl
servant
and
not
to
be
taring
and
tatthering
away
as
av
money
had
no
eend
and
afther
all
she
added
there
war
nothing
like
industhry
and
who
know
whether
that
born
villain
barry
might
yet
get
sich
a
hoult
of
the
money
that
there
be
no
getting
it
out
of
his
fist
and
she
then
depicted
in
most
pathetic
language
what
would
be
the
misery
of
herself
and
all
the
kellys
if
martin
flushed
with
his
prosperity
were
to
give
up
the
farm
at
toneroe
and
afterwards
find
that
he
had
been
robbed
of
his
expected
property
and
that
he
had
no
support
for
himself
and
his
young
bride
on
this
subject
martin
considerably
comforted
her
by
assuring
her
that
he
had
no
thoughts
of
abandoning
toneroe
although
he
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
acquiesce
in
the
very
small
cottage
and
he
moreover
expressed
his
thorough
confidence
that
he
would
neither
be
led
himself
nor
lead
anty
into
the
imprudence
of
a
marriage
until
he
had
well
satisfied
himself
that
the
property
was
safe
the
widow
was
well
pleased
to
find
from
martin
prudent
resolves
that
he
was
her
own
son
and
that
she
need
blush
for
him
and
then
they
parted
she
to
her
shop
and
he
to
his
dinner
not
however
before
he
had
promised
her
to
give
up
all
ideas
of
a
clandestine
marriage
and
to
permit
himself
to
be
united
to
his
wife
in
the
face
of
day
as
became
a
kelly
the
evening
passed
over
quietly
and
snugly
at
the
inn
martin
had
not
much
difficulty
in
persuading
his
three
companions
to
take
a
glass
of
punch
each
out
of
his
tumbler
and
less
in
getting
them
to
take
a
second
and
before
they
went
to
bed
he
and
anty
were
again
intimate
and
as
he
was
sitting
next
her
for
a
couple
of
hours
on
the
little
sofa
opposite
the
fire
it
is
more
than
probable
that
he
got
his
arm
round
her
waist
a
comfortable
position
which
seemed
in
no
way
to
shock
the
decorum
of
either
meg
or
jane
ix
mr
daly
the
attorney
we
must
now
see
how
things
went
on
in
the
enemy
camp
the
attorney
drove
up
to
the
door
of
dunmore
house
on
his
car
and
was
shown
into
the
where
he
met
barry
lynch
the
two
young
men
were
acquainted
though
not
intimate
with
each
other
and
they
bowed
and
then
shook
hands
and
barry
told
the
attorney
that
he
was
welcome
to
dunmore
house
and
the
attorney
made
another
bow
rubbed
his
hands
before
the
fire
and
said
it
was
a
very
cold
evening
and
barry
said
it
was
cold
for
that
time
of
the
year
which
considering
that
they
were
now
in
the
middle
of
february
showed
that
barry
was
rather
abroad
and
did
exactly
know
what
to
say
he
remained
for
about
a
minute
silent
before
the
fire
and
then
asked
daly
if
like
to
see
his
room
and
the
attorney
acquiescing
he
led
him
up
to
it
and
left
him
there
the
truth
was
that
as
the
time
of
the
man
visit
had
drawn
nearer
barry
had
become
more
and
more
embarrassed
and
now
that
the
attorney
had
absolutely
come
his
employer
felt
himself
unable
to
explain
the
business
before
dinner
these
fellows
are
so
confoundedly
sharp
i
shall
never
be
up
to
him
till
i
get
a
tumbler
of
punch
on
board
said
he
to
himself
comforting
himself
with
the
reflection
besides
never
well
able
for
anything
till
i
get
a
little
warmed
we
get
along
like
a
house
on
fire
when
we
got
the
hot
water
between
us
the
true
meaning
of
all
which
was
that
he
had
the
courage
to
make
known
his
villanous
schemes
respecting
his
sister
till
he
was
half
drunk
and
in
order
the
earlier
to
bring
about
this
necessary
and
now
daily
consummation
he
sneaked
downstairs
and
took
a
solitary
glass
of
brandy
to
fortify
himself
for
entertaining
the
attorney
the
dinner
was
dull
enough
for
of
course
as
long
as
the
man
was
in
the
room
there
was
no
talking
on
business
and
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
barry
was
not
likely
to
be
an
agreeable
companion
the
attorney
ate
his
dinner
as
if
it
was
a
part
of
the
fee
received
in
payment
of
the
work
he
was
to
do
and
with
a
determination
to
make
the
most
of
it
at
last
the
dishes
disappeared
and
with
them
terry
rooney
who
however
like
a
faithful
servant
felt
too
strong
an
interest
in
his
master
affairs
to
be
very
far
absent
when
matters
of
importance
were
likely
to
be
discussed
and
now
mr
daly
said
lynch
we
can
be
snug
here
without
interruption
for
an
hour
or
two
you
find
that
whiskey
old
and
good
i
think
but
if
you
prefer
wine
that
port
on
the
table
came
from
barton
in
sackville
street
thank
ye
if
i
take
anything
it
be
a
glass
of
punch
but
as
business
to
talk
of
i
better
keep
my
head
clear
my
head
never
so
clear
then
as
when
i
done
my
second
tumbler
i
never
so
sure
of
what
i
about
as
when
i
a
little
warmed
says
you
my
head
strong
it
no
reason
should
be
weak
but
do
as
you
like
liberty
hall
here
now
mr
daly
that
is
as
far
as
i
concerned
you
knew
my
father
i
believe
mr
daly
well
then
mr
lynch
i
did
exactly
know
him
but
living
so
near
him
and
he
having
so
much
business
in
the
county
and
myself
having
a
little
i
believe
i
been
in
company
with
him
odd
times
he
was
a
queer
man
was
he
mr
daly
was
he
then
i
dare
say
i
did
know
much
about
him
i
take
the
sugar
from
you
mr
lynch
i
believe
i
might
as
well
mix
a
drop
as
the
night
cold
that
right
i
thought
you
were
the
fellow
to
sit
with
an
empty
glass
before
you
but
as
i
was
saying
before
the
old
boy
was
a
queer
hand
that
is
latterly
for
the
last
year
or
so
of
course
you
know
all
about
his
will
faith
then
not
much
i
heard
he
left
a
will
dividing
the
property
between
you
and
miss
lynch
he
did
just
at
the
last
moment
when
the
breath
was
much
more
than
left
in
him
he
signed
a
will
making
away
half
the
estate
just
as
you
say
to
my
sister
blake
could
have
broke
the
will
only
he
was
so
d
and
stupid
it
too
late
now
i
suppose
why
i
could
hardly
answer
that
you
know
as
i
never
heard
the
circumstances
but
i
was
given
to
understand
that
blake
consulted
mcmahon
and
that
mcmahon
would
take
up
the
case
as
there
was
nothing
he
could
put
before
the
chancellor
mind
i
only
repeating
what
people
said
in
tuam
and
about
there
of
course
i
could
think
of
advising
till
i
knew
the
particulars
was
it
on
this
subject
mr
lynch
you
were
good
enough
to
send
for
me
not
at
all
mr
daly
i
look
upon
that
as
done
and
gone
bad
luck
to
blake
and
mcmahon
both
the
truth
is
between
you
and
me
daly
i
do
mind
telling
you
as
i
hope
now
you
will
become
my
man
of
business
and
it
only
fair
you
should
know
all
about
it
the
truth
is
blake
was
more
interested
on
the
other
side
and
he
was
determined
the
case
should
go
before
the
chancellor
but
when
my
father
signed
that
will
it
was
just
after
one
of
those
fits
he
had
lately
that
could
be
proved
and
he
did
know
what
he
was
doing
from
adam
he
did
know
what
was
in
the
will
nor
that
he
was
signing
a
will
at
all
so
help
me
he
did
however
that
over
it
was
to
talk
about
that
that
i
sent
for
you
only
sorrow
seize
the
rogue
that
made
the
old
man
rob
me
it
was
anty
herself
poor
creature
she
knew
nothing
about
it
it
was
those
who
meant
to
get
hold
of
my
money
through
her
that
did
it
poor
anty
heaven
knows
she
was
up
to
such
a
dodge
as
that
well
mr
lynch
of
course
i
know
nothing
of
the
absolute
facts
but
from
what
i
hear
i
think
it
as
well
to
let
the
will
alone
the
chancellor
wo
put
a
will
aside
in
a
hurry
it
always
a
difficult
job
would
cost
an
immense
sum
of
money
which
should
any
way
come
out
of
the
property
and
after
all
the
chances
are
ten
to
one
be
beat
perhaps
you
right
now
though
i
sure
had
the
matter
been
properly
taken
up
at
first
had
you
seen
the
whole
case
at
the
first
start
the
thing
could
have
been
done
i
sure
you
would
have
said
so
but
that
over
now
it
another
business
i
want
you
for
but
you
do
drink
your
punch
and
it
dry
work
talking
without
wetting
one
whistle
and
barry
carried
out
his
own
recommendation
i
doing
very
well
thank
ye
mr
lynch
and
what
is
it
i
can
do
for
you
that
what
i
coming
to
you
know
that
by
the
will
my
sister
anty
gets
from
four
to
five
hundred
a
year
i
did
know
the
amount
but
i
believe
she
has
half
whatever
there
is
exactly
half
the
land
half
the
cash
half
the
house
half
everything
except
the
debts
and
those
were
contracted
in
my
name
and
i
must
pay
them
all
is
that
hard
mr
daly
i
did
know
your
father
had
debts
oh
but
he
had
debts
which
ought
to
have
been
his
though
as
i
said
they
stand
in
my
name
and
i
must
pay
them
and
i
suppose
what
you
now
want
is
to
saddle
the
debts
on
the
entire
property
if
you
can
really
prove
that
the
debts
were
incurred
for
your
father
benefit
i
should
think
you
might
do
that
but
has
your
sister
refused
to
pay
the
half
they
ca
be
heavy
wo
miss
lynch
agree
to
pay
the
half
herself
this
last
lie
of
barry
for
to
give
the
devil
his
due
old
sim
had
owed
one
penny
for
the
last
twenty
years
was
only
a
bright
invention
of
the
moment
thrown
off
by
our
injured
hero
to
aggravate
the
hardships
of
his
case
but
he
was
determined
to
make
the
most
of
it
not
heavy
faith
they
heavy
and
d
d
heavy
too
mr
daly
what
take
two
hundred
out
of
my
miserable
share
of
the
property
divil
a
less
oh
there
never
any
knowing
how
a
man
cut
up
till
he
gone
that
true
but
how
could
your
father
owe
such
a
sum
as
that
and
no
one
know
it
why
that
must
be
four
or
five
thousand
pounds
about
five
i
believe
and
you
put
your
name
to
them
is
that
it
something
like
it
you
know
he
and
lord
ballindine
years
ago
were
fighting
about
the
leases
we
held
under
the
old
lord
and
then
the
old
man
wanted
ready
money
and
borrowed
it
in
dublin
and
some
years
since
that
is
about
three
years
ago
sooner
than
see
any
of
the
property
sold
i
took
up
the
debt
myself
you
know
it
was
all
as
good
as
my
own
then
and
now
confound
it
i
must
pay
the
whole
out
of
the
miserable
thing
that
left
me
under
this
infernal
will
but
it
even
about
that
i
sent
for
you
only
i
must
explain
exactly
how
matters
are
before
i
come
to
the
real
point
but
your
father
name
must
be
joined
with
yours
in
the
debt
and
if
so
you
can
come
upon
the
entire
property
for
the
payment
there
no
difficulty
about
that
your
sister
of
course
must
pay
the
half
it
not
so
my
dear
fellow
i
ca
explain
the
thing
exactly
but
it
i
that
owe
the
money
and
i
must
pay
it
but
it
no
good
talking
of
that
well
you
see
anty
that
my
sister
has
this
property
all
in
her
own
hands
but
you
do
drink
your
punch
and
barry
mixed
his
third
tumbler
of
course
she
has
and
surely
she
wo
refuse
to
pay
half
the
claims
on
the
estate
never
mind
the
claims
answered
barry
who
began
to
fear
that
he
had
pushed
his
little
invention
a
thought
too
far
i
tell
you
i
must
stand
to
them
you
do
suppose
i
ask
her
to
pay
a
penny
as
a
favour
no
i
a
little
too
proud
for
that
besides
it
be
no
use
not
the
least
and
that
what
i
coming
to
you
see
anty
got
this
money
and
you
know
do
you
mr
daly
poor
anty
not
just
like
other
people
no
said
mr
daly
i
did
i
ca
say
i
know
much
about
miss
lynch
i
never
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
but
did
you
never
hear
she
was
quite
right
indeed
i
never
did
then
well
that
odd
but
we
never
had
it
much
talked
about
poor
creature
indeed
there
was
no
necessity
for
people
to
know
much
about
it
for
she
never
gave
any
trouble
and
to
tell
the
truth
as
long
as
she
was
kept
quiet
she
never
gave
us
occasion
to
think
much
about
it
but
confound
them
for
rogues
those
who
have
got
hold
of
her
now
have
quite
upset
her
but
what
is
it
ails
your
sister
mr
lynch
to
have
it
out
at
once
then
she
not
right
in
her
upper
story
mind
i
do
mean
she
a
downright
lunatic
but
she
cracked
poor
thing
and
quite
unable
to
judge
for
herself
in
and
such
like
and
though
she
might
have
done
very
well
poor
thing
and
passed
without
notice
if
she
been
left
quiet
as
was
always
intended
i
afraid
now
unless
she
well
managed
she
end
her
life
in
the
ballinasloe
asylum
the
attorney
made
no
answer
to
this
although
barry
paused
to
allow
him
to
do
so
daly
was
too
sharp
and
knew
his
employer
character
too
well
to
believe
all
he
said
and
he
now
began
to
fancy
that
he
saw
what
the
affectionate
brother
was
after
well
daly
continued
barry
after
a
minute
pause
after
the
old
man
died
we
went
on
quiet
enough
for
some
time
i
was
up
in
dublin
mostly
about
that
confounded
loan
and
poor
anty
was
left
here
by
herself
and
what
should
she
do
but
take
up
with
a
low
huxter
family
in
the
town
here
that
bad
said
the
attorney
was
there
an
unmarried
young
man
among
them
at
all
faith
there
was
so
as
great
a
blackguard
as
there
is
in
connaught
and
miss
lynch
is
going
to
marry
him
that
just
it
daly
that
what
we
must
prevent
you
know
for
the
sake
of
the
family
i
could
let
it
go
on
then
poor
creature
be
plundered
and
she
be
a
downright
idiot
in
no
time
and
you
know
daly
the
property
go
to
the
devil
and
where
i
be
then
daly
could
help
thinking
that
in
all
probability
his
kind
host
would
not
be
long
in
following
the
property
but
he
did
not
say
so
he
merely
asked
the
name
of
the
blackguard
whom
miss
anty
meant
to
marry
wait
till
i
tell
you
the
whole
of
it
the
first
thing
i
heard
was
that
anty
had
made
a
low
ruffian
named
moylan
her
agent
i
know
him
she
could
have
done
much
worse
well
she
made
him
her
agent
without
speaking
to
me
or
telling
me
a
word
about
it
and
i
could
make
out
what
had
put
it
into
her
head
till
i
heard
that
this
old
rogue
was
a
kind
of
cousin
to
some
people
living
here
named
kelly
what
the
widow
that
keeps
the
inn
the
very
same
confound
her
for
an
impertinent
scheming
old
hag
as
she
is
well
that
the
house
that
anty
was
always
going
to
drinking
tea
with
the
daughters
and
walking
with
the
son
an
infernal
young
farmer
that
lives
with
them
the
worst
of
the
whole
set
what
martin
kelly
there
worse
fellows
than
him
mr
lynch
i
be
hanged
if
i
know
them
then
but
if
there
are
i
do
choose
my
poor
sister
only
one
remove
from
an
idiot
and
hardly
that
to
be
carried
off
from
her
mother
house
and
married
to
such
a
fellow
as
that
why
it
all
the
same
infernal
plot
it
the
same
people
that
got
the
old
man
to
sign
the
will
when
he
was
past
his
senses
begad
they
must
have
been
clever
to
do
that
how
the
deuce
could
they
have
got
the
will
drawn
i
tell
you
they
do
it
answered
barry
whose
courage
was
now
somewhat
raised
by
the
whiskey
that
neither
here
nor
there
but
they
did
it
and
when
the
old
fool
was
dead
they
got
this
moylan
made
anty
agent
and
then
the
hag
of
a
mother
comes
up
here
before
daylight
and
bribes
the
servant
and
carries
her
off
down
to
her
filthy
den
which
she
calls
an
inn
and
when
i
call
to
see
my
sister
i
get
nothing
but
insolence
and
abuse
and
when
did
this
happen
when
did
miss
lynch
leave
the
house
yesterday
morning
about
four
she
went
down
of
her
own
accord
though
d
l
a
bit
the
old
hag
came
up
here
and
filched
her
out
of
her
bed
but
she
could
have
taken
your
sister
away
unless
she
had
wished
to
go
of
course
she
wished
it
but
a
silly
creature
like
her
ca
be
let
to
do
all
she
she
wishes
to
get
a
husband
and
does
care
what
sort
of
a
one
she
gets
but
you
do
suppose
an
old
maid
forty
years
old
who
has
always
been
too
stupid
and
foolish
ever
to
be
seen
or
spoken
to
should
be
allowed
to
throw
away
four
hundred
on
the
first
robber
that
tries
to
cheat
her
you
do
mean
to
say
there
a
law
to
prevent
that
i
do
know
how
you
prevent
it
mr
lynch
she
her
own
mistress
what
the
d
l
do
you
mean
to
say
there
nothing
to
prevent
an
idiot
like
that
from
marrying
if
she
an
idiot
but
i
think
you
find
your
sister
has
sense
enough
to
marry
whom
she
pleases
i
tell
you
she
an
idiot
not
raving
mind
but
everybody
knows
she
was
never
fit
to
manage
anything
who
prove
it
why
i
would
divil
a
doubt
of
it
i
could
prove
that
she
never
could
all
her
life
ah
my
dear
sir
you
could
do
it
nor
could
i
advise
you
to
try
that
is
unless
there
were
plenty
more
who
could
swear
positively
that
she
was
out
of
her
mind
would
the
servants
swear
that
could
you
yourself
now
positively
swear
that
she
was
out
of
her
mind
why
she
never
had
any
mind
to
be
out
of
unless
you
are
very
sure
she
is
and
for
a
considerable
time
back
has
been
a
confirmed
lunatic
you
be
very
wrong
very
i
mean
mr
lynch
to
try
that
game
at
all
things
would
come
out
which
you
would
like
and
your
motives
would
be
would
be
seen
through
at
once
the
attorney
was
on
the
point
of
saying
but
he
stopped
himself
and
finished
by
the
words
called
in
question
and
i
to
sit
here
then
and
see
that
young
blackguard
kelly
run
off
with
what
ought
to
be
my
own
and
my
sister
into
the
bargain
blessed
if
i
do
if
you
ca
put
me
in
the
way
of
stopping
it
find
those
that
can
you
getting
too
much
in
a
hurry
mr
lynch
is
your
sister
at
the
inn
now
to
be
sure
she
is
and
she
is
engaged
to
this
young
man
she
is
why
then
she
might
be
married
to
him
for
anything
you
know
she
might
if
he
was
here
but
they
tell
me
he
away
in
dublin
if
they
told
you
so
they
told
you
wrong
he
came
into
dunmore
from
tuam
on
the
same
car
with
myself
this
very
afternoon
what
martin
kelly
then
he
be
off
with
her
this
night
while
sitting
here
and
barry
jumped
up
as
if
to
rush
out
and
prevent
the
immediate
consummation
of
his
worst
fears
stop
a
moment
mr
lynch
said
the
more
prudent
and
more
sober
lawyer
if
they
were
off
you
could
follow
them
and
if
you
did
follow
and
find
them
you
could
prevent
their
being
married
if
such
were
their
wish
and
they
had
a
priest
ready
to
do
it
take
my
advice
remain
quiet
where
you
are
and
let
talk
the
matter
over
as
for
taking
out
a
commission
lunatico
as
we
call
it
you
find
you
could
do
it
miss
lynch
may
be
a
little
weak
or
so
in
the
upper
story
but
not
a
lunatic
and
you
could
make
her
so
if
you
had
half
dunmore
to
back
you
because
she
be
brought
before
the
commissioners
herself
and
that
you
know
would
soon
settle
the
question
but
you
might
still
prevent
the
marriage
for
a
time
at
any
rate
at
least
i
think
so
and
after
that
you
must
trust
to
the
chapter
of
accidents
so
help
me
that
all
i
want
if
i
got
her
once
up
here
again
and
was
sure
the
thing
was
off
for
a
month
or
so
let
me
alone
then
for
bringing
her
to
reason
as
daly
watched
his
comrade
reddening
face
and
saw
the
malicious
gleam
of
his
eyes
as
he
declared
how
easily
he
manage
the
affair
if
poor
anty
was
once
more
in
the
house
his
heart
misgave
him
even
though
he
was
a
sharp
attorney
at
the
idea
of
assisting
such
a
cruel
brute
in
his
cruelty
and
for
a
moment
he
had
determined
to
throw
up
the
matter
barry
was
so
unprincipled
and
so
wickedly
malicious
in
his
want
of
principle
that
he
disgusted
even
daly
but
on
second
thoughts
the
lawyer
remembered
that
if
he
did
do
the
job
another
would
and
quieting
his
not
very
violent
qualms
of
conscience
with
the
idea
that
though
employed
by
the
brother
he
might
also
to
a
certain
extent
protect
the
sister
he
proceeded
to
give
his
advice
as
to
the
course
which
would
be
most
likely
to
keep
the
property
out
of
the
hands
of
the
kellys
he
explained
to
barry
that
as
anty
had
left
her
own
home
in
company
with
martin
mother
and
as
she
now
was
a
guest
at
the
widow
it
was
unlikely
that
any
immediate
clandestine
marriage
should
be
resorted
to
that
their
most
likely
course
would
be
to
brazen
the
matter
out
and
have
the
wedding
solemnised
without
any
secrecy
and
without
any
especial
notice
to
him
barry
that
on
the
next
morning
a
legal
notice
should
be
prepared
in
tuam
and
served
on
the
widow
informing
her
that
it
was
his
intention
to
indict
her
for
conspiracy
in
enticing
away
from
her
own
home
his
sister
anty
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
possession
of
her
property
she
being
of
weak
mind
and
not
able
properly
to
manage
her
own
affairs
that
a
copy
of
this
notice
should
also
be
sent
to
martin
warning
him
that
he
would
be
included
in
the
indictment
if
he
took
any
proceedings
with
regard
to
miss
lynch
and
that
a
further
copy
should
if
possible
be
put
into
the
hands
of
miss
lynch
herself
you
may
be
sure
that
frighten
them
continued
daly
and
then
you
know
when
we
see
what
sort
of
fight
they
make
we
be
able
to
judge
whether
we
ought
to
go
on
and
prosecute
or
not
i
think
the
widow
be
very
shy
of
meddling
when
she
finds
you
in
earnest
and
you
see
mr
lynch
he
went
on
dropping
his
voice
if
you
go
into
court
as
i
do
think
you
will
you
go
with
clean
hands
as
you
ought
to
do
nobody
can
say
anything
against
you
for
trying
to
prevent
your
sister
from
marrying
a
man
so
much
younger
than
herself
and
so
much
inferior
in
station
and
fortune
you
wo
seem
to
gain
anything
by
it
and
that
everything
with
a
jury
and
then
you
know
if
it
comes
out
that
miss
lynch
mind
is
rather
touched
it
an
additional
reason
why
you
should
protect
her
from
intriguing
and
interested
schemers
do
you
see
barry
did
see
or
fancied
he
saw
that
he
had
now
got
the
kellys
in
a
dead
fix
and
anty
back
into
his
own
hands
again
and
his
having
been
fully
roused
by
his
potations
he
was
tolerably
happy
and
talked
very
loudly
of
the
manner
in
which
he
would
punish
those
huxters
who
had
presumed
to
interfere
with
him
in
the
management
of
his
family
towards
the
latter
end
of
the
evening
he
became
even
more
confidential
and
showed
the
cloven
foot
if
possible
more
undisguisedly
than
he
had
hitherto
done
he
spoke
of
the
impossibility
of
allowing
four
hundred
a
year
to
be
carried
off
from
him
and
suggested
to
daly
that
his
sister
would
soon
drop
off
that
there
would
then
be
a
nice
thing
left
and
that
he
daly
should
have
the
agency
and
if
he
pleased
the
use
of
dunmore
house
as
for
himself
he
had
no
idea
of
mewing
himself
up
in
such
a
hole
as
that
but
before
he
went
he
take
care
to
drive
that
villain
moylan
out
of
the
place
the
cursed
villany
of
those
kellys
to
go
and
palm
such
a
robber
as
that
off
on
his
sister
by
way
of
an
agent
to
all
this
daly
paid
but
little
attention
for
he
saw
that
his
host
was
drunk
but
when
moylan
name
was
mentioned
he
began
to
think
that
it
might
be
as
well
either
to
include
him
in
the
threatened
indictment
or
else
which
would
be
better
still
to
buy
him
over
to
their
side
as
they
might
probably
learn
from
him
what
martin
plans
really
were
barry
was
however
too
tipsy
to
pay
much
attention
to
this
or
to
understand
any
plans
so
the
two
retired
to
their
beds
barry
determined
as
he
declared
to
the
attorney
in
his
drunken
friendship
to
have
it
out
of
anty
when
he
caught
her
and
daly
promising
to
go
to
tuam
early
in
the
morning
have
the
notices
prepared
and
served
and
come
back
in
the
evening
to
dine
and
sleep
and
have
if
possible
an
interview
with
mr
moylan
as
he
undressed
he
reflected
that
during
his
short
professional
career
he
had
been
thrown
into
the
society
of
many
unmitigated
rogues
of
every
description
but
that
his
new
friend
barry
lynch
though
he
might
not
equal
them
in
energy
of
villany
and
courage
to
do
serious
evil
beat
them
all
hollow
in
selfishness
and
utter
brutal
want
of
feeling
conscience
and
principle
x
dot
blake
advice
in
hour
or
two
after
martin
kelly
had
left
porto
bello
in
the
ballinasloe
our
other
hero
lord
ballindine
and
his
friend
dot
blake
started
from
morrison
hotel
with
post
horses
for
handicap
lodge
and
as
they
travelled
in
blake
very
comfortable
barouche
they
reached
their
destination
in
time
for
a
late
dinner
without
either
adventure
or
discomfort
here
they
remained
for
some
days
fully
occupied
with
the
education
of
their
horses
the
attention
necessary
to
the
engagements
for
which
they
were
to
run
and
with
their
lord
ballindine
horse
brien
boru
was
destined
to
give
the
saxons
a
dressing
at
epsom
and
put
no
one
knows
how
many
thousands
into
his
owner
hands
by
winning
the
derby
and
arrangements
had
already
been
made
for
sending
him
over
to
john
scott
the
english
trainer
at
an
expense
which
if
the
horse
should
by
chance
fail
to
be
successful
would
be
of
very
serious
consequence
to
his
lordship
but
lord
ballindine
had
made
up
his
mind
or
rather
blake
had
made
it
up
for
him
and
the
thing
was
to
be
done
the
risk
was
to
be
run
and
the
preparations
the
sweats
and
the
gallops
the
physicking
feeding
and
coddling
kept
frank
tolerably
well
employed
though
the
whole
process
would
have
gone
on
quite
as
well
had
he
been
absent
it
was
not
so
however
with
dot
blake
the
turf
to
him
was
not
an
expensive
pleasure
but
a
very
serious
business
and
one
which
to
give
him
his
due
he
well
understood
he
himself
regulated
the
work
both
of
his
horses
and
his
men
and
saw
that
both
did
what
was
allotted
to
them
he
took
very
good
care
that
he
was
never
charged
a
guinea
where
a
guinea
was
not
necessary
and
that
he
got
a
guinea
worth
for
every
guinea
he
laid
out
in
fact
he
trained
his
own
horses
and
was
thus
able
to
assure
himself
that
his
interests
were
never
made
subservient
to
those
of
others
who
kept
horses
in
the
same
stables
dot
was
in
his
glory
and
in
his
element
on
the
curragh
and
he
was
never
quite
happy
anywhere
else
this
however
was
not
the
case
with
his
companion
for
a
couple
of
days
the
excitement
attending
brien
boru
was
sufficient
to
fill
lord
ballindine
mind
but
after
that
he
could
not
help
recurring
to
other
things
he
was
much
in
want
of
money
and
had
been
civilly
told
by
his
agent
managing
clerk
before
he
left
town
that
there
was
some
difficulty
in
the
way
of
his
immediately
getting
the
sum
required
this
annoyed
him
for
he
could
not
carry
on
the
game
without
money
and
then
again
he
was
unhappy
to
be
so
near
fanny
wyndham
from
day
to
day
without
seeing
her
he
was
truly
and
earnestly
attached
to
her
and
miserable
at
the
threat
which
had
been
all
but
made
by
her
guardian
that
the
match
should
be
broken
off
it
was
true
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
go
to
grey
abbey
as
long
as
he
remained
at
handicap
lodge
and
having
made
the
resolution
he
thought
he
was
wise
in
keeping
it
but
still
he
continually
felt
that
she
must
be
aware
that
he
was
in
the
neighbourhood
and
could
not
but
be
hurt
at
his
apparent
indifference
and
then
he
knew
that
her
guardian
would
make
use
of
his
present
employment
his
sojourn
at
such
a
den
of
sporting
characters
as
his
friend
blake
habitation
and
his
continued
absence
from
grey
abbey
though
known
to
be
in
its
vicinity
as
additional
arguments
for
inducing
his
ward
to
declare
the
engagement
at
an
end
these
troubles
annoyed
him
and
though
he
daily
stood
by
and
saw
brien
boru
go
through
his
manoeuvres
he
was
discontented
and
fidgety
he
had
been
at
handicap
lodge
about
a
fortnight
and
was
beginning
to
feel
anything
but
happy
his
horse
was
to
go
over
in
another
week
money
was
not
plentiful
with
him
and
tradesmen
were
becoming
obdurate
and
persevering
his
host
blake
was
not
a
soothing
or
a
comfortable
friend
under
these
circumstances
he
gave
him
a
good
deal
of
practical
advice
but
he
could
not
sympathise
with
him
blake
was
a
sharp
hard
sensible
man
who
reduced
everything
to
pounds
shillings
and
pence
lord
ballindine
was
a
man
of
feeling
and
for
the
time
at
least
a
man
of
pleasure
and
though
they
were
or
thought
themselves
friends
they
did
not
pull
well
together
in
fact
they
bored
each
other
terribly
one
morning
lord
ballindine
was
riding
out
from
the
when
he
met
if
not
an
old
at
any
rate
an
intimate
acquaintance
named
tierney
mr
or
as
he
was
commonly
called
mat
tierney
was
a
bachelor
about
sixty
years
of
age
who
usually
inhabited
a
lodge
near
the
curragh
and
who
kept
a
horse
or
two
on
the
turf
more
for
the
sake
of
the
standing
which
it
gave
him
in
the
society
he
liked
best
than
from
any
intense
love
of
the
sport
he
was
a
fat
jolly
fellow
always
laughing
and
usually
in
a
good
humour
he
was
very
fond
of
what
he
considered
the
world
and
the
world
at
least
that
part
of
it
which
knew
him
returned
the
compliment
well
my
lord
said
he
after
a
few
minutes
of
enthusiasm
respecting
brien
boru
i
congratulate
you
sincerely
what
about
said
lord
ballindine
why
i
find
you
got
a
horse
and
i
hear
you
got
rid
of
a
lady
you
very
lucky
no
doubt
in
both
but
i
think
fortune
has
stood
to
you
most
in
the
latter
lord
ballindine
was
petrified
he
did
not
know
what
to
reply
he
was
aware
that
his
engagement
with
miss
wyndham
was
so
public
that
tierney
could
allude
to
no
other
lady
but
he
could
not
conceive
how
any
one
could
have
heard
that
his
intended
marriage
was
broken
off
at
any
rate
how
he
could
have
heard
it
spoken
of
so
publicly
as
to
induce
him
to
mention
it
in
that
sort
of
way
to
himself
his
first
impulse
was
to
be
very
indignant
but
he
felt
that
no
one
would
dream
of
quarrelling
with
mat
tierney
so
he
said
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
collect
his
thoughts
sufficiently
i
was
not
aware
of
the
second
piece
of
luck
mr
tierney
pray
who
is
the
lady
why
miss
wyndham
said
mat
himself
a
little
astonished
at
lord
ballindine
tone
i
sure
mr
tierney
said
frank
you
would
say
nothing
particularly
in
connection
with
a
lady
name
which
you
intended
either
to
be
impertinent
or
injurious
were
it
not
that
i
am
quite
certain
of
this
i
must
own
that
what
you
have
just
said
would
appear
to
be
both
my
dear
lord
said
the
other
surprised
and
grieved
i
beg
ten
thousand
pardons
if
i
have
unintentionally
said
anything
which
you
feel
to
be
either
but
surely
if
i
am
not
wrong
in
asking
the
match
between
you
and
miss
wyndham
is
broken
off
may
i
ask
you
mr
tierney
who
told
you
so
certainly
lord
kilcullen
and
as
he
is
miss
wyndham
cousin
and
lord
cashel
son
i
could
not
but
think
the
report
authentic
this
overset
frank
still
more
thoroughly
lord
kilcullen
would
never
have
spread
the
report
publicly
unless
he
had
been
authorised
to
do
so
by
lord
cashel
frank
and
lord
kilcullen
had
never
been
intimate
and
the
former
was
aware
that
the
other
had
always
been
averse
to
the
proposed
marriage
but
still
he
would
never
have
openly
declared
that
the
marriage
was
broken
off
had
he
not
had
some
authority
for
saying
so
as
you
seem
somewhat
surprised
continued
mat
seeing
that
lord
ballindine
remained
silent
and
apparently
at
a
loss
for
what
he
ought
to
say
perhaps
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
lord
kilcullen
mentioned
it
last
night
very
publicly
at
a
as
an
absolute
fact
indeed
from
his
manner
i
thought
he
wished
it
to
be
generally
made
known
i
presumed
therefore
that
it
had
been
mutually
agreed
between
you
that
the
event
was
not
to
come
off
that
the
match
was
not
to
be
run
and
with
my
peculiar
views
you
know
on
the
subject
of
matrimony
i
thought
it
a
fair
point
for
congratulation
if
lord
kilcullen
had
misled
me
i
heartily
beg
to
apologise
and
at
the
same
time
by
giving
you
my
authority
to
show
you
that
i
could
not
intend
anything
impertinent
if
it
suits
you
you
are
quite
at
liberty
to
tell
lord
kilcullen
all
i
have
told
you
and
if
you
wish
me
to
contradict
the
report
which
i
must
own
i
have
spread
i
will
do
so
frank
felt
that
he
could
not
be
angry
with
mat
tierney
he
therefore
thanked
him
for
his
open
explanation
and
merely
muttering
something
about
private
affairs
not
being
worthy
of
public
interest
rode
off
towards
handicap
lodge
it
appeared
very
plain
to
him
that
the
grey
abbey
family
must
have
discarded
him
that
fanny
wyndham
lord
and
lady
cashel
and
the
whole
set
must
have
made
up
their
minds
to
drop
him
altogether
otherwise
one
of
the
family
would
not
have
openly
declared
the
match
at
an
end
and
yet
he
was
at
a
loss
to
conceive
how
they
could
have
done
so
how
even
lord
cashel
could
have
reconciled
it
to
himself
to
do
so
without
the
courtesy
of
writing
to
him
on
the
subject
and
then
when
he
thought
of
her
his
own
fanny
as
he
had
so
often
called
her
he
was
still
more
bewildered
she
with
whom
he
had
sat
for
so
many
sweet
hours
talking
of
the
impossibility
of
their
ever
forgetting
deserting
or
even
slighting
each
other
she
who
had
been
so
entirely
devoted
to
him
so
much
more
than
engaged
to
him
could
she
have
lent
her
name
to
such
a
heartless
mode
of
breaking
her
faith
if
i
had
merely
proposed
for
her
through
her
guardian
thought
frank
to
himself
if
i
had
got
lord
cashel
to
make
the
engagement
as
many
men
do
i
should
not
be
surprised
but
after
all
that
has
passed
between
us
after
all
her
vows
and
all
her
and
then
lord
ballindine
struck
his
horse
with
his
heel
and
made
a
cut
at
the
air
with
his
whip
as
he
remembered
certain
passages
more
binding
even
than
promises
warmer
even
than
vows
which
seemed
to
make
him
as
miserable
now
as
they
had
made
him
happy
at
the
time
of
their
occurrence
i
would
not
believe
it
he
continued
meditating
if
twenty
kilcullens
said
it
or
if
fifty
mat
tierneys
swore
to
it
and
then
he
rode
on
towards
the
lodge
in
a
state
of
mind
for
which
i
am
quite
unable
to
account
if
his
disbelief
in
fanny
wyndham
constancy
was
really
as
strong
as
he
had
declared
it
to
be
and
as
he
rode
many
unusual
thoughts
for
hitherto
frank
had
not
been
a
very
man
crowded
his
mind
as
to
the
baseness
falsehood
and
iniquity
of
the
human
race
especially
of
rich
cautious
old
peers
who
had
beautiful
wards
in
their
power
by
the
time
he
had
reached
the
lodge
he
had
determined
that
he
must
now
do
something
and
that
as
he
was
quite
unable
to
come
to
any
satisfactory
conclusion
on
his
own
unassisted
judgment
he
must
consult
blake
who
by
the
bye
was
nearly
as
sick
of
fanny
wyndham
as
he
would
have
been
had
he
himself
been
the
person
engaged
to
marry
her
as
he
rode
round
to
the
yard
he
saw
his
friend
standing
at
the
door
of
one
of
the
stables
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
well
frank
how
does
brien
go
not
that
he
ever
be
the
thing
till
he
gets
to
the
other
side
of
the
water
they
never
be
able
to
bring
a
horse
out
as
he
should
be
on
the
curragh
till
regular
trained
gallops
the
slightest
frost
in
spring
or
sun
in
summer
and
the
ground
so
hard
you
might
as
well
gallop
your
horse
down
the
pavement
of
grafton
street
confound
the
horse
answered
frank
come
here
dot
a
minute
i
want
to
speak
to
you
what
the
d
l
the
matter
he
not
lame
is
he
who
what
brien
boru
not
that
i
know
of
i
wish
the
brute
had
never
been
foaled
and
why
so
what
crotchet
have
you
got
in
your
head
now
something
wrong
about
fanny
i
suppose
why
did
you
hear
anything
nothing
but
what
you
told
me
i
just
seen
mat
tierney
and
he
told
me
that
kilcullen
had
declared
at
a
large
yesterday
that
the
match
between
me
and
his
cousin
was
finally
broken
off
you
would
believe
what
mat
tierney
would
say
mat
was
only
taking
a
rise
out
of
you
not
at
all
he
was
not
only
speaking
seriously
but
he
told
me
what
i
very
sure
was
the
truth
as
far
as
lord
kilcullen
was
concerned
i
mean
i
sure
kilcullen
said
it
and
in
the
most
public
manner
he
could
and
now
the
question
is
what
had
i
better
do
there
no
doubt
as
to
what
you
better
do
the
question
is
what
you
rather
do
but
what
had
i
do
call
on
kilcullen
for
an
explanation
that
the
last
thing
to
think
of
no
but
declare
what
he
reports
to
be
the
truth
return
miss
wyndham
the
lock
of
hair
you
have
in
your
desk
and
next
your
heart
or
wherever
you
keep
it
write
her
a
pretty
note
and
conclude
by
saying
that
the
free
to
wed
another
that
what
i
should
do
it
very
odd
blake
that
you
wo
speak
seriously
to
a
man
for
a
moment
you
as
much
heart
in
you
as
one
of
your
own
horses
i
wish
i
never
come
to
this
cursed
lodge
of
yours
i
be
all
right
then
as
for
my
heart
frank
if
i
have
as
much
as
my
horses
i
ought
to
be
contented
for
are
usually
considered
to
have
a
good
deal
as
for
my
cursed
lodge
i
can
assure
you
i
have
endeavoured
and
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
still
endeavour
to
make
it
as
agreeable
to
you
as
i
am
able
and
as
to
my
speaking
seriously
upon
my
word
i
never
spoke
more
so
you
asked
me
what
i
thought
you
had
better
do
and
i
began
by
telling
you
there
would
be
a
great
difference
between
that
and
what
you
rather
do
but
in
heaven
name
why
would
you
have
me
break
off
with
miss
wyndham
when
every
one
knows
i
engaged
to
her
and
when
you
know
that
i
wish
to
marry
her
firstly
to
prevent
her
breaking
off
with
you
though
i
fear
hardly
time
for
that
and
secondly
in
consequence
as
the
newspapers
say
of
incompatibility
of
temper
why
you
do
even
know
her
but
i
know
you
and
i
know
what
your
joint
income
would
be
and
i
know
that
there
would
be
great
incompatibility
between
you
as
lord
ballindine
with
a
wife
and
family
and
fifteen
hundred
a
year
or
so
but
mind
i
only
telling
you
what
i
think
you
better
do
well
i
sha
do
that
if
i
was
once
settled
down
i
could
live
as
well
on
fifteen
hundred
a
year
as
any
country
gentleman
in
ireland
it
only
the
interference
of
lord
cashel
that
makes
me
determined
not
to
pull
in
till
i
am
married
if
he
had
let
me
have
my
own
way
i
should
by
this
time
have
had
a
horse
in
the
world
except
one
or
two
hunters
or
so
down
in
the
country
well
frank
if
you
determined
to
get
yourself
married
i
give
you
the
best
advice
in
my
power
as
to
the
means
of
doing
it
is
that
what
you
want
i
want
to
know
what
you
think
i
ought
to
do
just
at
this
minute
with
matrimony
as
the
you
know
i
wish
to
marry
fanny
wyndham
and
the
sooner
the
better
is
that
it
of
course
she
be
of
age
now
in
a
few
days
replied
lord
ballindine
then
i
advise
you
to
order
a
new
blue
coat
and
to
buy
a
confusion
cried
frank
stamping
his
foot
and
turning
away
in
a
passion
and
then
he
took
up
his
hat
to
rush
out
of
the
room
in
which
the
latter
part
of
the
conversation
had
taken
place
stop
a
minute
frank
said
blake
and
do
be
in
a
passion
what
i
said
was
only
meant
to
show
you
how
easy
i
think
it
is
for
you
to
marry
miss
wyndham
if
you
choose
easy
and
every
soul
at
grey
abbey
turned
against
me
in
consequence
of
my
owning
that
brute
of
a
horse
i
go
over
there
at
once
and
i
show
lord
cashel
that
at
any
rate
he
shall
not
treat
me
like
a
child
as
for
kilcullen
if
he
interferes
with
me
or
my
name
in
any
way
i
you
what
thrash
him
indeed
i
like
nothing
better
and
then
shoot
him
be
tried
by
your
peers
and
perhaps
hung
is
that
it
oh
that
nonsense
i
do
wish
to
fight
any
one
but
i
am
not
going
to
be
insulted
i
do
think
you
are
i
do
think
there
the
least
chance
of
kilcullen
insulting
you
he
has
too
much
worldly
wisdom
but
to
come
back
to
miss
wyndham
if
you
really
mean
to
marry
her
and
if
as
i
believe
she
is
really
fond
of
you
lord
cashel
and
all
the
family
ca
prevent
it
she
is
probably
angry
that
you
have
not
been
over
there
he
is
probably
irate
at
your
staying
here
and
not
unlikely
has
made
use
of
her
own
anger
to
make
her
think
that
she
has
quarrelled
with
you
and
hence
kilcullen
report
and
what
shall
i
do
now
nothing
but
eat
your
dinner
and
drink
your
wine
ride
over
see
lord
cashel
and
tell
him
but
do
it
quite
coolly
if
you
can
exactly
what
you
have
heard
and
how
you
have
heard
it
and
beg
him
to
assure
lord
kilcullen
that
he
is
mistaken
in
his
notion
that
the
match
is
off
and
beg
also
that
the
report
may
not
be
repeated
do
this
and
do
it
as
if
you
were
lord
cashel
equal
not
as
if
you
were
his
son
or
his
servant
if
you
are
collected
and
steady
with
him
for
ten
minutes
you
soon
find
that
he
will
become
bothered
and
unsteady
that
very
easy
to
say
here
but
it
not
so
easy
to
do
there
you
do
know
him
as
i
do
he
so
sedate
and
so
slow
and
so
dull
especially
sitting
alone
as
he
does
of
a
morning
in
that
large
dingy
uncomfortable
of
his
he
measures
his
words
like
senna
and
salts
and
their
tone
is
as
disagreeable
then
do
you
drop
out
yours
like
prussic
acid
and
you
beat
him
at
his
own
game
those
are
all
externals
my
dear
fellow
when
a
man
knows
he
has
nothing
within
his
head
to
trust
to
when
he
has
neither
sense
nor
genius
he
puts
on
a
wig
ties
up
his
neck
in
a
white
choker
sits
in
a
big
chair
and
frightens
the
world
with
his
silence
remember
if
you
were
not
a
baby
he
would
not
be
a
bugbear
and
should
i
not
ask
to
see
fanny
by
all
means
do
leave
grey
abbey
without
seeing
and
making
your
peace
with
miss
wyndham
that
be
easy
with
you
because
it
your
i
own
that
with
myself
it
would
be
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
morning
work
but
do
ask
to
see
her
as
a
favour
when
done
with
the
lord
and
do
let
your
conference
be
very
long
when
you
done
with
the
lord
tell
him
you
say
a
word
to
the
lady
and
whatever
may
have
been
his
you
find
that
if
you
cool
he
be
bothered
and
he
wo
know
how
to
refuse
and
if
he
does
prevent
you
i
sure
miss
wyndham
wo
and
if
he
asks
about
these
wretched
horses
of
mine
do
let
him
talk
more
about
your
affairs
than
you
can
help
but
if
he
presses
you
and
he
wo
if
you
play
your
game
well
tell
him
that
you
quite
aware
your
income
wo
allow
you
to
keep
up
an
establishment
at
the
curragh
after
you
married
but
about
brien
boru
and
the
derby
brien
boru
you
might
as
well
talk
to
him
about
your
do
go
into
particulars
stick
to
generals
he
never
ask
you
those
questions
unless
he
sees
you
shiver
and
shake
like
a
after
a
great
deal
of
confabulation
in
which
dot
blake
often
repeated
his
opinion
of
lord
ballindine
folly
in
not
rejoicing
at
an
opportunity
of
breaking
off
the
match
it
was
determined
that
frank
should
ride
over
the
next
morning
and
do
exactly
what
his
friend
proposed
if
however
one
might
judge
from
his
apparent
dread
of
the
interview
with
lord
cashel
there
was
but
little
chance
of
his
conducting
it
with
the
coolness
or
assurance
insisted
on
by
dot
the
probability
was
that
when
the
time
did
come
he
would
as
blake
said
shiver
and
shake
like
a
and
what
will
you
do
when
you
married
frank
said
blake
for
beginning
to
think
the
symptoms
are
strong
and
you
hardly
get
out
of
it
now
do
why
i
suppose
i
do
much
the
same
as
others
have
two
children
and
live
happy
ever
afterwards
i
dare
say
you
right
about
the
two
children
only
you
might
say
two
dozen
but
as
to
the
living
happy
that
more
problematical
what
do
you
mean
to
eat
and
drink
eggs
potatoes
and
bacon
buttermilk
and
potheen
it
odd
if
i
ca
get
plenty
of
them
in
mayo
if
i
nothing
better
footnote
pootheen
illegal
untaxed
whiskey
moonshine
i
suppose
you
will
frank
but
bacon
wo
go
down
well
after
venison
and
a
course
of
claret
is
a
bad
preparative
for
potheen
punch
not
the
man
to
live
with
a
family
on
a
small
income
and
what
the
d
l
you
do
i
do
know
you
fortify
kelly
court
that
be
the
first
step
is
it
against
the
repealers
faith
no
you
join
them
of
course
but
against
the
and
his
officers
an
army
much
more
likely
to
crown
their
enterprises
with
success
you
seem
to
forget
dot
that
after
all
i
marrying
a
girl
with
quite
as
large
a
fortune
as
i
had
any
right
to
expect
the
limit
to
your
expectations
was
only
in
your
own
modesty
the
less
you
had
a
right
in
the
common
parlance
to
expect
the
more
you
wanted
and
the
more
you
ought
to
have
looked
for
say
that
miss
wyndham
fortune
clears
a
thousand
a
year
of
your
property
you
would
never
be
able
to
get
along
on
what
you
have
no
i
tell
you
what
you
do
you
shut
up
kelly
court
raise
the
rents
take
a
moderate
house
in
london
and
lord
cashel
when
his
party
are
in
will
get
you
made
a
court
stick
of
and
you
lead
just
such
a
life
as
your
grandfather
if
it
not
very
glorious
at
any
rate
it
a
useful
kind
of
life
i
hope
miss
wyndham
will
like
it
you
have
to
christen
your
children
ernest
and
albert
and
that
sort
of
thing
that
the
worst
of
it
and
you
never
be
let
to
sit
down
and
that
a
bore
but
you
strong
legs
it
would
never
do
for
me
i
could
never
stand
out
a
long
tragedy
in
drury
lane
with
my
neck
in
a
stiff
white
choker
and
my
toes
screwed
into
tight
dress
boots
i
sooner
be
a
porter
myself
for
he
can
go
to
bed
when
the
day
over
you
very
witty
dot
but
you
know
i
the
last
man
in
ireland
not
excepting
yourself
to
put
up
with
that
kind
of
thing
whatever
i
may
have
to
live
on
i
shall
live
in
my
own
country
and
on
my
own
property
very
well
if
you
wo
be
a
gold
stick
there
the
other
alternative
fortify
kelly
court
and
prepare
for
the
officers
of
the
two
there
certainly
more
fun
in
it
and
you
can
go
out
with
the
harriers
on
a
sunday
afternoon
and
live
like
a
of
the
ould
times
only
the
punch
kill
you
in
about
ten
years
go
on
dot
go
on
you
want
to
provoke
me
but
you
wo
i
wonder
whether
you
bear
it
as
well
if
i
told
you
you
die
a
without
a
friend
or
a
shilling
to
bless
you
i
do
think
i
should
because
i
should
know
that
you
were
threatening
me
with
a
fate
which
my
conduct
and
line
of
life
would
not
warrant
any
one
in
expecting
upon
my
word
then
i
think
there
quite
as
much
chance
of
that
as
there
is
of
my
getting
shut
up
by
bailiffs
in
kelly
court
and
dying
drunk
i
bet
you
fifty
pounds
i
a
better
account
at
my
bankers
than
you
have
in
ten
years
faith
i
not
take
it
it
be
hard
work
getting
fifty
pounds
out
of
you
then
in
the
meantime
come
and
play
a
game
of
billiards
before
dinner
to
this
lord
ballindine
consented
and
they
adjourned
to
the
but
before
they
commenced
playing
blake
declared
that
if
the
names
of
lord
cashel
or
miss
wyndham
were
mentioned
again
that
evening
he
should
retreat
to
his
own
room
and
spend
the
hours
by
himself
so
for
the
rest
of
that
day
lord
ballindine
was
again
driven
back
upon
brien
boru
and
the
derby
for
conversation
as
dot
was
too
close
about
his
own
stable
to
talk
much
of
his
own
horses
and
their
performances
except
when
he
was
doing
so
with
an
eye
to
business
xi
the
earl
of
cashel
about
two
on
the
following
morning
lord
ballindine
set
off
for
grey
abbey
on
horseback
dressed
with
something
more
than
ordinary
care
and
with
a
considerable
palpitation
about
his
heart
he
hardly
knew
himself
what
or
whom
he
feared
but
he
knew
that
he
was
afraid
of
something
he
had
a
cold
sinking
sensation
within
him
and
he
felt
absolutely
certain
that
he
should
be
signally
defeated
in
his
present
mission
he
had
plenty
of
what
is
usually
called
courage
had
his
friend
recommended
him
instantly
to
call
out
lord
kilcullen
and
shoot
him
and
afterwards
any
number
of
other
young
men
who
might
express
a
thought
in
opposition
to
his
claim
on
miss
wyndham
hand
he
would
have
set
about
it
with
the
greatest
readiness
and
aptitude
but
he
knew
he
could
not
baffle
the
appalling
solemnity
of
lord
cashel
in
his
own
study
frank
was
not
so
very
weak
a
man
as
he
would
appear
to
be
when
in
the
society
of
blake
he
unfortunately
allowed
blake
to
think
for
him
in
many
things
and
he
found
a
convenience
in
having
some
one
to
tell
him
what
to
do
but
he
was
in
most
respects
a
better
and
in
some
even
a
wiser
man
than
his
friend
he
often
felt
that
the
kind
of
life
he
was
leading
contracting
debts
which
he
could
not
pay
and
spending
his
time
in
pursuits
which
were
not
really
congenial
to
him
was
unsatisfactory
and
discreditable
and
it
was
this
very
feeling
and
the
inability
to
defend
that
which
he
knew
to
be
wrong
and
foolish
which
made
him
so
certain
that
he
would
not
be
able
successfully
to
persist
in
his
claim
to
miss
wyndham
hand
in
opposition
to
the
trite
and
objections
which
he
knew
her
guardian
would
put
forward
he
consoled
himself
however
with
thinking
that
at
any
rate
they
could
not
prevent
his
seeing
her
and
he
was
quite
sanguine
as
to
her
forgiveness
if
he
but
got
a
fair
opportunity
of
asking
it
and
when
that
was
obtained
why
should
the
care
for
any
one
fanny
would
be
of
age
and
her
own
mistress
in
a
few
days
and
all
the
solemn
earls
in
england
and
ireland
too
could
not
then
prevent
her
marrying
whom
and
when
she
liked
he
thought
a
great
deal
on
all
his
friend
had
said
to
his
future
poverty
but
then
his
ideas
and
blake
were
very
different
about
life
blake
idea
of
happiness
was
the
concentrating
of
every
thing
into
a
focus
for
his
own
enjoyment
whereas
he
frank
had
only
had
recourse
to
dissipation
and
extravagance
because
he
had
nothing
to
make
home
pleasant
to
him
if
he
once
had
fanny
wyndham
installed
as
lady
ballindine
at
kelly
court
he
was
sure
he
could
do
his
duty
as
a
country
gentleman
and
live
on
his
income
be
it
what
it
might
not
only
without
grumbling
but
without
wishing
for
anything
more
he
was
fond
of
his
country
his
name
and
his
countrymen
he
was
fully
convinced
of
his
folly
in
buying
and
in
allowing
himself
to
be
dragged
on
the
turf
he
would
sell
brien
boru
and
the
other
two
irish
chieftains
for
what
they
would
fetch
and
show
fanny
and
her
guardian
that
he
was
in
earnest
in
his
intention
of
reforming
blake
might
laugh
at
him
if
he
liked
but
he
would
not
stay
to
be
laughed
at
he
felt
that
handicap
lodge
was
no
place
for
him
and
besides
why
should
he
bear
dot
disagreeable
sarcasms
it
was
not
the
part
of
a
real
friend
to
say
such
cutting
things
as
he
continually
did
after
all
lord
cashel
would
be
a
safer
friend
or
at
any
rate
adviser
and
instead
of
trying
to
defeat
him
by
coolness
or
insolence
he
would
at
once
tell
him
of
all
his
intentions
explain
to
him
exactly
how
matters
stood
and
prove
his
good
resolutions
by
offering
to
take
whatever
steps
the
earl
might
recommend
about
the
horses
this
final
determination
made
him
easier
in
this
mind
and
as
he
entered
the
gates
of
grey
abbey
park
he
was
tolerably
comfortable
trusting
to
his
own
good
resolutions
and
the
effect
which
he
felt
certain
the
expression
of
them
must
have
on
lord
cashel
grey
abbey
is
one
of
the
largest
but
by
no
means
one
of
the
most
picturesque
demesnes
in
ireland
it
is
situated
in
the
county
of
kildare
about
two
miles
from
the
little
town
of
kilcullen
in
a
flat
uninteresting
and
not
very
fertile
country
the
park
itself
is
extensive
and
tolerably
well
wooded
but
it
wants
water
and
undulation
and
is
deficient
of
any
object
of
attraction
except
that
of
size
and
not
very
magnificent
timber
i
suppose
years
ago
there
was
an
abbey
here
or
near
the
spot
but
there
is
now
no
vestige
of
it
remaining
in
a
corner
of
the
demesne
there
are
standing
the
remains
of
one
of
those
strong
square
ugly
castles
which
two
centuries
since
were
the
real
habitations
of
the
landed
proprietors
of
the
country
and
many
of
which
have
been
inhabited
even
to
a
much
later
date
they
now
afford
the
strongest
record
of
the
apparently
miserable
state
of
life
which
even
the
favoured
of
the
land
then
endured
and
of
the
numberless
domestic
comforts
which
years
and
skill
have
given
us
apt
as
we
are
to
look
back
with
fond
regret
to
the
happy
days
of
past
periods
this
old
castle
now
used
as
a
is
the
only
record
of
antiquity
at
grey
abbey
and
yet
the
ancient
family
of
the
greys
have
lived
there
for
centuries
the
first
of
them
who
possessed
property
in
ireland
obtained
in
the
reign
of
henry
ii
grants
of
immense
tracts
of
land
stretching
through
wicklow
kildare
and
the
queen
and
counties
and
although
his
descendants
have
been
unable
to
retain
through
the
various
successive
convulsions
which
have
taken
place
in
the
interior
of
ireland
since
that
time
anything
like
an
eighth
of
what
the
family
once
pretended
to
claim
the
earl
of
cashel
their
present
representative
has
enough
left
to
enable
him
to
consider
himself
a
very
great
man
the
present
mansion
built
on
the
site
of
that
in
which
the
family
had
lived
till
about
seventy
years
since
is
like
the
grounds
large
commodious
and
uninteresting
it
is
built
of
stone
which
appears
as
if
it
had
been
plastered
over
is
three
stories
high
and
the
windows
are
all
of
the
same
size
and
at
regular
intervals
the
body
of
the
house
looks
like
a
huge
square
dutch
old
lady
and
the
two
wings
might
be
taken
for
her
two
equally
fat
square
dutch
daughters
inside
the
furniture
is
good
strong
and
plain
there
are
plenty
of
and
offices
a
small
gallery
of
very
indifferent
paintings
and
a
kitchen
with
an
excellent
and
patent
boilers
of
every
shape
considering
the
nature
of
the
attractions
it
is
somewhat
strange
that
lord
cashel
should
have
considered
it
necessary
to
make
it
generally
known
that
the
park
might
be
seen
any
day
between
the
hours
of
nine
and
six
and
the
house
on
tuesdays
and
fridays
between
the
hours
of
eleven
and
four
yet
such
is
the
case
and
the
strangeness
of
this
proceeding
on
his
part
is
a
good
deal
diminished
by
the
fact
that
persons
either
induced
by
lord
cashel
good
nature
or
thinking
that
any
big
house
must
be
worth
seeing
very
frequently
pay
to
the
housekeeper
for
the
privilege
of
being
dragged
through
every
room
in
the
mansion
there
is
a
bed
there
in
which
the
regent
slept
when
in
ireland
and
a
room
which
was
tenanted
by
lord
normanby
when
lord
lieutenant
there
is
moreover
a
satin
counterpane
which
was
made
by
the
lord
aunt
and
a
which
was
given
to
the
lord
grandfather
by
frederick
the
great
these
are
the
lions
of
the
place
and
the
gratification
experienced
by
those
who
see
them
is
no
doubt
great
but
i
doubt
if
it
equals
the
annoyance
and
misery
to
which
they
are
subjected
in
being
obliged
to
pass
one
unopened
door
that
of
the
private
room
of
lady
selina
the
only
daughter
of
the
earl
at
present
unmarried
it
contains
only
a
bed
and
the
usual
instruments
of
a
lady
toilet
but
lady
selina
does
not
choose
to
have
it
shown
and
it
has
become
invested
in
the
eyes
of
the
visitors
with
no
ordinary
mystery
many
a
petitionary
whisper
is
addressed
to
the
housekeeper
on
the
subject
but
in
vain
and
consequently
the
public
too
often
leave
grey
abbey
dissatisfied
as
lord
ballindine
rode
through
the
gates
and
up
the
long
approach
to
the
house
he
was
so
satisfied
of
the
wisdom
of
his
own
final
resolution
and
of
the
successful
termination
of
his
embassy
under
such
circumstances
that
he
felt
relieved
of
the
uncomfortable
sensation
of
fear
which
had
oppressed
him
and
it
was
only
when
the
high
powdered
servant
told
him
with
a
very
solemn
face
that
the
earl
was
alone
in
the
the
odious
room
he
hated
so
much
that
he
began
again
to
feel
a
little
misgiving
however
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
now
so
he
gave
up
his
horse
to
the
groom
and
followed
the
servant
into
the
lord
cashel
was
a
man
about
with
considerable
external
dignity
of
appearance
though
without
any
personal
advantage
either
in
face
figure
or
manner
he
had
been
an
earl
with
a
large
income
for
thirty
years
and
in
that
time
he
had
learned
to
look
collected
even
when
his
ideas
were
confused
to
keep
his
eye
steady
and
to
make
a
few
words
go
a
long
way
he
had
never
been
intemperate
and
was
therefore
strong
and
hale
for
his
years
he
had
not
done
many
glaringly
foolish
things
and
therefore
had
a
character
for
wisdom
and
judgment
he
had
run
away
with
no
man
wife
and
since
his
marriage
had
seduced
no
man
daughter
he
was
therefore
considered
a
moral
man
he
was
not
so
deeply
in
debt
as
to
have
his
affairs
known
to
every
one
and
hence
was
thought
prudent
and
as
he
lived
in
his
own
house
with
his
own
wife
paid
his
servants
and
labourers
their
wages
regularly
and
nodded
in
church
for
two
hours
every
sunday
he
was
thought
a
good
man
such
were
his
virtues
and
by
these
negative
qualities
this
he
had
acquired
and
maintained
a
considerable
influence
in
the
country
when
lord
ballindine
name
was
announced
he
slowly
rose
and
just
touching
the
tip
of
frank
fingers
by
way
of
shaking
hands
with
him
hoped
he
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
well
the
viscount
hoped
the
same
of
the
earl
and
of
the
ladies
this
included
the
countess
and
lady
selina
as
well
as
fanny
and
was
therefore
not
a
particular
question
but
having
hoped
this
and
the
earl
remaining
silent
he
got
confused
turned
red
hummed
and
hawed
a
little
sat
down
and
then
endeavouring
to
drown
his
confusion
in
volubility
began
talking
quickly
about
his
anxiety
to
make
final
arrangements
concerning
matters
which
of
course
he
had
most
deeply
at
heart
and
at
last
ran
himself
fairly
aground
from
not
knowing
whether
under
the
present
circumstances
he
ought
to
speak
of
his
affianced
to
her
guardian
as
fanny
or
miss
wyndham
when
he
had
quite
done
and
was
dead
silent
and
had
paused
sufficiently
long
to
assure
the
earl
that
he
was
going
to
say
nothing
further
just
at
present
the
great
man
commenced
his
answer
this
is
a
painful
subject
my
lord
most
peculiarly
painful
at
the
present
time
but
surely
after
all
that
has
passed
but
especially
after
what
has
passed
lord
cashel
thought
this
was
a
dead
hit
you
can
not
consider
your
engagement
with
miss
wyndham
to
be
still
in
force
good
gracious
and
why
not
my
lord
i
am
ready
to
do
anything
her
friends
in
fact
i
came
solely
this
morning
to
consult
yourself
about
i
sure
fanny
herself
ca
conceive
the
engagement
to
be
broken
off
of
course
if
miss
wyndham
wishes
it
but
i
believe
i
ca
believe
if
it
about
the
horses
lord
cashel
upon
my
word
i
ready
to
sell
them
this
was
not
very
dignified
in
poor
frank
and
to
tell
the
truth
he
was
completely
bothered
lord
cashel
looked
so
more
than
ordinarily
glum
had
he
been
going
to
put
on
a
black
cap
and
pass
sentence
of
death
or
disinherit
his
eldest
son
he
could
not
have
looked
more
stern
or
more
important
frank
lack
of
dignity
added
to
his
and
made
him
feel
immeasurably
superior
to
any
little
difficulty
which
another
person
might
have
felt
in
making
the
communication
he
was
going
to
make
he
was
really
quite
in
a
solemn
good
humour
lord
confusion
was
so
flattering
i
can
assure
you
my
lord
miss
wyndham
calls
for
no
such
sacrifice
nor
do
i
there
was
a
time
when
as
her
guardian
i
ventured
to
hint
and
i
own
i
was
taking
a
liberty
a
fruitless
liberty
in
doing
so
that
i
thought
your
remaining
on
the
turf
was
hardly
prudent
but
i
can
assure
you
with
all
kindly
feeling
with
no
approach
to
animosity
that
i
will
not
offend
in
a
similar
way
again
i
hear
by
mere
rumour
that
you
have
extended
your
operations
to
the
other
kingdom
i
hope
i
have
not
been
the
means
of
inducing
you
to
do
so
but
advice
if
not
complied
with
often
gives
a
bias
in
an
opposite
direction
with
regard
to
miss
wyndham
i
must
express
and
i
really
had
thought
it
was
unnecessary
to
do
so
though
it
was
certainly
my
intention
as
it
was
miss
wyndham
wish
that
i
should
have
written
to
you
formally
on
the
subject
but
your
own
conduct
excuse
me
lord
ballindine
your
own
evident
indifference
and
continued
i
fear
i
must
call
it
dissipation
and
your
as
i
considered
unfortunate
selection
of
acquaintance
combined
with
the
necessary
diminution
of
that
attachment
which
i
presume
miss
wyndham
once
felt
for
you
necessary
inasmuch
as
it
was
as
far
as
i
understand
never
of
a
sufficiently
ardent
nature
to
outlive
the
slights
indeed
my
lord
i
do
wish
to
offend
you
or
hurt
your
feelings
but
i
must
say
the
slights
which
it
encountered
here
the
earl
felt
that
his
sentence
was
a
little
confused
but
the
viscount
looked
more
so
and
therefore
not
at
all
abashed
by
the
want
of
a
finish
to
his
original
proposition
he
continued
glibly
enough
in
short
in
considering
all
the
features
of
the
case
i
thought
the
proposed
marriage
a
most
imprudent
one
and
on
questioning
miss
wyndham
as
to
her
feelings
i
was
i
must
own
gratified
to
learn
that
she
agreed
with
me
indeed
she
conceived
that
your
conduct
gave
ample
proof
my
lord
of
your
readiness
to
be
absolved
from
your
engagement
pardon
me
a
moment
my
lord
as
i
said
before
i
still
deemed
it
incumbent
on
me
and
on
my
ward
that
i
as
her
guardian
should
give
you
an
absolute
and
written
explanation
of
her
feelings
that
would
have
been
done
yesterday
and
this
most
unpleasant
meeting
would
have
been
spared
to
both
of
us
but
for
the
unexpected
did
you
hear
of
the
occurrence
which
has
happened
in
miss
wyndham
family
my
lord
occurrence
no
lord
cashel
i
did
not
hear
of
any
especial
occurrence
there
had
been
a
peculiarly
solemn
air
about
lord
cashel
during
the
whole
of
the
interview
which
deepened
into
quite
funereal
gloom
as
he
asked
the
last
question
but
he
was
so
uniformly
solemn
that
this
had
not
struck
lord
ballindine
besides
an
appearance
of
solemnity
agreed
so
well
with
lord
cashel
cast
of
features
and
tone
of
voice
that
a
visage
more
lengthened
and
a
speech
somewhat
slower
than
usual
served
only
to
show
him
off
as
so
much
the
more
clearly
identified
by
his
own
characteristics
thus
a
man
who
always
wears
a
green
coat
does
not
become
remarkable
by
a
new
green
coat
he
is
only
so
much
the
more
than
ever
the
man
in
the
green
coat
lord
ballindine
therefore
answered
the
question
without
the
appearance
of
that
surprise
which
lord
cashel
expected
he
would
feel
if
he
had
really
not
yet
heard
of
the
occurrence
about
to
be
related
to
him
the
earl
therefore
made
up
his
mind
as
indeed
he
had
nearly
done
before
that
frank
knew
well
what
was
going
to
be
told
him
though
it
suited
his
purpose
to
conceal
his
knowledge
he
could
not
however
give
his
young
brother
nobleman
the
lie
and
he
was
therefore
constrained
to
tell
his
tale
as
if
to
one
to
whom
it
was
unknown
he
was
determined
however
though
he
could
not
speak
out
plainly
to
let
frank
see
that
he
was
not
deceived
by
his
hypocrisy
and
that
he
lord
cashel
was
well
aware
not
only
that
the
event
about
to
be
told
had
been
known
at
handicap
lodge
but
that
the
viscount
present
visit
to
grey
abbey
had
arisen
out
of
that
knowledge
lord
ballindine
up
to
this
moment
was
perfectly
ignorant
of
this
event
and
it
is
only
doing
justice
to
him
to
say
that
had
he
heard
of
it
it
would
at
least
have
induced
him
to
postpone
his
visit
for
some
time
lord
cashel
paused
for
a
few
moments
looking
at
frank
in
a
most
diplomatic
manner
and
then
proceeded
to
unfold
his
budget
i
am
much
surprised
that
you
should
not
have
heard
of
it
the
distressing
news
reached
grey
abbey
yesterday
and
must
have
been
well
known
in
different
circles
in
dublin
yesterday
morning
considering
the
great
intercourse
between
dublin
and
the
curragh
i
wonder
you
can
have
been
left
so
long
in
ignorance
of
a
circumstance
so
likely
to
be
widely
discussed
and
which
at
one
time
might
have
so
strongly
affected
your
own
interests
lord
cashel
again
paused
and
looked
hard
at
frank
he
flattered
himself
that
he
was
reading
his
thoughts
but
he
looked
as
if
he
had
detected
a
spot
on
the
other
collar
and
wanted
to
see
whether
it
was
ink
or
soot
lord
ballindine
was
however
confounded
when
the
earl
spoke
of
a
circumstance
so
likely
to
be
widely
discussed
mat
conversation
recurred
to
him
and
lord
kilcullen
public
declaration
that
fanny
wyndham
match
was
it
was
certainly
odd
for
lord
cashel
to
call
this
an
occurrence
in
miss
wyndham
family
but
then
he
had
a
way
of
saying
everything
i
say
continued
the
earl
after
a
short
pause
that
i
can
not
but
be
surprised
that
an
event
of
so
much
importance
of
so
painful
a
nature
and
doubtless
already
so
publicly
known
should
not
before
this
have
reached
the
ears
of
one
to
whom
i
presume
miss
wyndham
name
was
not
always
wholly
indifferent
but
as
you
have
not
heard
it
my
lord
i
will
communicate
it
to
you
and
again
he
paused
as
though
expecting
another
assurance
of
lord
ballindine
ignorance
why
my
lord
said
frank
i
did
hear
a
rumour
which
surprised
me
very
much
but
i
could
not
suppose
it
to
be
true
to
tell
the
truth
it
was
very
much
in
consequence
of
what
i
heard
that
i
came
to
grey
abbey
it
was
now
lord
cashel
turn
to
be
confounded
first
to
deny
that
he
had
heard
anything
about
it
and
then
immediately
to
own
that
he
had
heard
it
and
had
been
induced
to
renew
his
visits
to
grey
abbey
in
consequence
just
what
he
in
his
wisdom
had
suspected
was
the
case
but
how
could
lord
ballindine
have
the
face
to
own
it
i
must
however
tell
the
reader
the
event
of
which
frank
was
ignorant
and
which
it
appears
lord
cashel
is
determined
not
to
communicate
to
him
fanny
wyndham
father
had
held
a
governorship
or
some
golden
appointment
in
the
golden
days
of
india
and
consequently
had
died
rich
he
left
eighty
thousand
pounds
to
his
son
who
was
younger
than
fanny
and
twenty
to
his
daughter
his
son
had
lately
been
put
into
the
guards
but
he
was
not
long
spared
to
enjoy
his
sword
and
his
uniform
he
died
and
his
death
had
put
his
sister
in
possession
of
his
money
and
lord
cashel
thought
that
though
frank
might
slight
twenty
thousand
pounds
he
would
be
too
glad
to
be
allowed
to
remain
the
accepted
admirer
of
a
hundred
thousand
i
thought
you
must
have
heard
it
my
lord
resumed
the
senior
as
soon
as
he
had
collected
his
shreds
of
dignity
which
frank
open
avowal
had
somewhat
scattered
i
felt
certain
you
must
have
heard
it
and
you
will
i
am
sure
perceive
that
this
is
no
time
for
you
excuse
me
if
i
use
a
word
which
may
appear
harsh
it
is
no
time
for
any
one
not
intimately
connected
with
miss
wyndham
by
ties
of
family
to
intrude
upon
her
sorrow
frank
was
completely
bothered
he
thought
that
if
she
were
so
sorrowful
if
she
grieved
so
deeply
at
the
match
being
broken
off
that
was
just
the
reason
why
he
should
see
her
after
all
it
was
rather
flattering
to
himself
to
hear
of
her
sorrows
dear
fanny
was
she
so
grieved
that
she
was
forced
to
part
from
him
but
lord
cashel
he
said
i
am
ready
to
do
whatever
you
please
i
take
any
steps
you
advise
but
i
really
can
not
see
why
i
to
be
told
that
the
engagement
between
me
and
miss
wyndham
is
off
without
hearing
any
reason
from
herself
i
make
any
sacrifice
you
please
or
she
requires
i
sure
she
was
attached
to
me
and
she
can
not
have
overcome
that
affection
so
soon
i
have
already
said
that
we
require
miss
wyndham
requires
no
sacrifice
from
you
the
time
for
sacrifice
is
past
and
i
do
not
think
her
affection
was
of
such
a
nature
as
will
long
prey
on
her
spirits
my
affection
for
her
is
i
can
assure
you
pray
excuse
me
but
i
think
this
is
hardly
the
time
either
to
talk
of
or
to
show
your
affection
had
it
been
proved
to
be
of
a
lasting
i
fear
i
must
say
a
sincere
nature
it
would
now
have
been
most
valued
i
will
leave
yourself
to
say
whether
this
was
the
case
and
so
you
mean
to
say
lord
cashel
that
i
can
not
see
miss
wyndham
assuredly
lord
ballindine
and
i
must
own
that
i
hardly
appreciate
your
delicacy
in
asking
to
do
so
at
the
present
moment
there
was
something
very
hard
in
this
the
match
was
to
be
broken
off
without
any
notice
to
him
and
when
he
requested
at
any
rate
to
hear
this
decision
from
the
mouth
of
the
only
person
competent
to
make
it
he
was
told
that
it
was
indelicate
for
him
to
wish
to
do
so
this
put
his
back
up
well
my
lord
he
said
with
some
spirit
miss
wyndham
is
at
present
your
ward
and
in
your
house
and
i
am
obliged
to
postpone
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
which
at
least
i
am
entitled
of
hearing
her
decision
from
her
own
mouth
i
can
not
think
that
she
expects
i
should
be
satisfied
with
such
an
answer
as
i
have
now
received
i
shall
write
to
her
this
evening
and
shall
expect
at
any
rate
the
courtesy
of
an
answer
from
herself
my
advice
to
my
ward
will
be
not
to
write
to
you
at
any
rate
for
the
present
i
presume
my
lord
you
can
not
doubt
my
word
that
miss
wyndham
chooses
to
be
released
from
an
engagement
which
i
must
say
your
own
conduct
renders
it
highly
inexpedient
for
her
to
keep
i
do
doubt
your
word
of
course
lord
cashel
but
such
being
the
case
i
think
miss
wyndham
might
at
least
tell
me
so
herself
i
should
have
thought
lord
ballindine
that
you
would
have
felt
that
the
sudden
news
of
a
dearly
loved
brother
death
was
more
than
sufficient
to
excuse
miss
wyndham
from
undergoing
an
interview
which
even
under
ordinary
circumstances
would
be
of
very
doubtful
expediency
her
brother
death
good
gracious
is
harry
wyndham
dead
frank
was
so
truly
surprised
so
effectually
startled
by
the
news
which
he
now
for
the
first
time
heard
that
had
his
companion
possessed
any
real
knowledge
of
human
nature
he
would
at
once
have
seen
that
his
astonishment
was
not
affected
but
he
had
none
and
therefore
went
on
blundering
in
his
own
pompous
manner
yes
my
lord
he
is
dead
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
had
already
heard
it
and
unless
my
ears
deceived
me
you
explained
that
his
demise
was
the
immediate
cause
of
your
present
visit
i
can
not
however
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
i
think
you
have
exercised
a
sound
discretion
in
the
matter
in
expressing
such
an
opinion
however
i
am
far
from
wishing
to
utter
anything
which
may
be
irritating
or
offensive
to
your
feelings
upon
my
word
then
i
never
heard
a
word
about
it
till
this
moment
poor
harry
and
is
fanny
much
cut
up
miss
wyndham
is
much
afflicted
i
would
for
worlds
annoy
her
or
press
on
her
at
such
a
moment
pray
tell
her
lord
cashel
how
deeply
i
feel
her
sorrows
pray
tell
her
this
with
my
kindest
best
compliments
this
termination
was
very
cold
but
so
was
lord
cashel
face
his
lordship
had
also
risen
from
his
chair
and
frank
saw
it
was
intended
that
the
interview
should
end
but
he
would
now
have
been
glad
to
stay
he
wanted
to
ask
a
hundred
questions
how
the
poor
lad
had
died
whether
he
had
been
long
ill
whether
it
had
been
expected
but
he
saw
that
he
must
go
so
he
rose
and
putting
out
his
hand
which
lord
cashel
just
touched
he
said
good
bye
my
lord
i
trust
after
a
few
months
are
gone
by
you
may
see
reason
to
alter
the
opinion
you
have
expressed
respecting
your
ward
should
i
not
hear
from
you
before
then
i
shall
again
do
myself
the
honour
of
calling
at
grey
abbey
but
i
will
write
to
miss
wyndham
before
i
do
so
lord
cashel
had
the
honour
of
wishing
lord
ballindine
a
very
good
morning
and
of
bowing
him
to
the
door
and
so
the
interview
ended
xii
fanny
wyndham
when
lord
cashel
had
seen
frank
over
the
mat
which
lay
outside
his
study
door
and
that
there
was
a
six
foot
servitor
to
open
any
other
door
through
which
he
might
have
to
pass
he
returned
to
his
seat
and
drawing
his
chair
close
to
the
fire
began
to
speculate
on
fanny
and
her
discarded
lover
he
was
very
well
satisfied
with
himself
and
with
his
own
judgment
and
firmness
in
the
late
conversation
it
was
very
evident
that
frank
had
heard
of
harry
wyndham
death
and
of
fanny
great
accession
of
wealth
that
he
had
immediately
determined
that
the
heiress
was
no
longer
to
be
neglected
and
that
he
ought
to
strike
while
the
iron
was
hot
hence
his
visit
to
grey
abbey
his
pretended
ignorance
of
the
young
man
death
when
he
found
he
could
not
see
miss
wyndham
was
a
ruse
but
an
old
bird
like
lord
cashel
was
not
to
be
caught
with
chaff
and
then
how
indelicate
of
him
to
come
and
press
his
suit
immediately
after
news
of
so
distressing
a
nature
had
reached
miss
wyndham
how
very
impolitic
thought
lord
cashel
to
show
such
a
hurry
to
take
possession
of
the
fortune
how
completely
he
had
destroyed
his
own
game
and
then
other
thoughts
passed
through
his
mind
his
ward
had
now
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
clear
which
was
certainly
a
great
deal
of
ready
money
lord
cashel
had
no
younger
sons
but
his
heir
lord
kilcullen
was
an
expensive
man
and
owed
he
did
not
exactly
know
and
was
always
afraid
to
ask
how
much
he
must
marry
soon
or
he
would
be
sure
to
go
to
the
devil
he
had
been
living
with
actresses
and
quite
long
enough
for
his
own
respectability
and
if
he
ever
intended
to
be
such
a
pattern
to
the
country
as
his
father
it
was
now
time
for
him
to
settle
down
and
lord
cashel
bethought
himself
that
if
he
could
persuade
his
son
to
marry
fanny
wyndham
and
pay
his
debts
with
her
fortune
surely
he
could
owe
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
he
would
be
able
to
give
them
a
very
handsome
allowance
to
live
on
to
do
lord
cashel
justice
we
must
say
that
he
had
fully
determined
that
it
was
his
duty
to
break
off
the
match
between
frank
and
his
ward
before
he
heard
of
the
accident
which
had
so
enriched
her
and
fanny
herself
feeling
slighted
and
neglected
knowing
how
near
to
her
her
lover
was
and
that
nevertheless
he
never
came
to
see
her
hearing
his
name
constantly
mentioned
in
connection
merely
with
horses
and
jockeys
had
been
induced
to
express
her
acquiescence
in
her
views
and
to
throw
poor
frank
overboard
in
all
this
the
earl
had
been
actuated
by
no
mercenary
views
as
far
as
his
own
immediate
family
was
concerned
he
had
truly
and
justly
thought
that
lord
ballindine
with
his
limited
fortune
and
dissipated
habits
was
a
bad
match
for
his
ward
and
he
had
consequently
done
his
best
to
break
the
engagement
there
could
therefore
he
thought
be
nothing
unfair
in
his
taking
advantage
of
the
prudence
which
he
had
exercised
on
her
behalf
he
did
not
know
when
he
was
persuading
her
to
renounce
lord
ballindine
that
at
that
moment
her
young
rich
and
only
brother
was
lying
at
the
point
of
death
he
had
not
done
it
for
his
own
sake
or
lord
kilcullen
there
could
therefore
be
nothing
unjust
or
ungenerous
in
their
turning
to
their
own
account
the
two
losses
that
of
her
lover
and
her
brother
which
had
fallen
on
miss
wyndham
at
the
same
time
if
he
as
her
guardian
would
have
been
wrong
to
allow
lord
ballindine
to
squander
her
twenty
thousands
he
would
be
so
much
the
more
wrong
to
let
him
make
ducks
and
drakes
of
five
times
as
much
in
this
manner
he
quieted
his
conscience
as
to
his
premeditated
absorption
of
his
fortune
it
was
true
that
lord
kilcullen
was
a
heartless
roué
whereas
lord
ballindine
was
only
a
thoughtless
rake
but
then
lord
kilcullen
would
be
an
earl
and
a
peer
of
parliament
and
lord
ballindine
was
only
an
irish
viscount
it
was
true
that
in
spite
of
her
present
anger
fanny
dearly
loved
lord
ballindine
and
was
dearly
loved
by
him
and
that
lord
kilcullen
was
not
a
man
to
love
or
be
loved
but
then
the
kelly
court
rents
what
were
they
to
the
grey
abbey
rents
not
a
twentieth
part
of
them
and
above
all
lord
kilcullen
vices
were
filtered
through
the
cleansing
medium
of
his
father
partiality
and
lord
ballindine
faults
were
magnified
by
the
cautious
scruples
of
fanny
guardian
the
old
man
settled
therefore
in
his
own
mind
that
fanny
should
be
his
dear
daughter
and
the
only
difficulty
he
expected
to
encounter
was
with
his
hopeful
son
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
fanny
might
object
or
that
she
could
be
other
than
pleased
with
the
arrangement
he
determined
however
to
wait
a
little
before
the
tidings
of
her
future
destiny
should
be
conveyed
to
her
although
no
time
was
to
be
lost
in
talking
over
the
matter
with
lord
kilcullen
in
the
meantime
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
to
tell
fanny
of
lord
ballindine
visit
and
the
wily
peer
was
glad
to
think
that
she
could
not
but
be
further
disgusted
at
the
hurry
which
her
former
lover
had
shown
to
renew
his
protestations
of
affection
as
soon
as
the
tidings
of
her
wealth
had
reached
him
however
he
would
say
nothing
on
that
head
he
would
merely
tell
her
that
lord
ballindine
had
called
had
asked
to
see
her
and
had
been
informed
of
her
determination
to
see
him
no
more
he
sat
for
a
considerable
time
musing
over
the
fire
and
strengthening
his
resolution
and
then
he
stalked
and
strutted
into
the
where
the
ladies
were
sitting
to
make
his
communication
to
miss
wyndham
miss
wyndham
and
her
cousin
lady
selina
grey
the
only
unmarried
daughter
left
on
the
earl
hands
were
together
lady
selina
was
not
in
her
and
in
manner
face
and
disposition
was
something
like
her
father
she
was
not
therefore
very
charming
but
his
faults
were
softened
down
in
her
and
what
was
pretence
in
him
was
to
a
certain
degree
real
in
her
she
had
a
most
exaggerated
conception
of
her
own
station
and
dignity
and
of
what
was
due
to
her
and
expected
from
her
because
her
rank
enabled
her
to
walk
out
of
a
room
before
other
women
she
fancied
herself
better
than
them
and
entitled
to
be
thought
better
she
was
plain
and
in
no
ways
attractive
but
she
had
refused
the
offer
of
a
respectable
country
gentleman
because
he
was
only
a
country
gentleman

then
flattered
herself
that
she
owned
the
continuance
of
her
maiden
condition
to
her
high
station

made
her
a
fit
match
only
for
the
most
exalted

she
was
true
industrious
and
charitable
she
worked
hard
to
bring
her
acquirements
to
that
pitch
which
she
considered
necessary
to
render
her
fit
for
her
position
she
truly
loved
her
family
and
tried
hard
to
love
her
neighbours
in
which
she
might
have
succeeded
but
for
the
immeasurable
height
from
which
she
looked
down
on
them
she
listened
complacently
to
all
those
serious
cautions
against
pride
which
her
religion
taught
her
and
considered
that
she
was
obeying
its
warnings
when
she
spoke
condescendingly
to
those
around
her
she
thought
that
condescension
was
humility
and
that
her
was
not
pride
but
a
proper
feeling
of
her
own
and
her
family
dignity

she
had
hair

was
never

worn
in
plain
braids
fastened
at
the

of
her
head
together
with
the
long
rich
folds
which
were
collected
there
under
a
simple
comb
her
forehead
was
high
and
beautifully
formed

when
she

showed
the

her

encouraged
her

comb

that
luxuriant
hair
and
which
gave
the
greatest
charm
to
her
face
her
mouth
was
large
too
large
for
a
beauty

therefore
she
was
not
a
regular
beauty

were
she
talking

you

willing
to
please
you
you
could
hardly
wish
it
to
be
less
i
can
not
describe
the
shade
of
her
complexion

it
was
rich
and
glowing
and
though
she
was
not
a

i
believe
that
in

her
portrait
an
artist
would
have
mixed
more

retroussé
french
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
now
speaking
she
was
sitting
or
rather
lying
on
a
sofa
with
her
face
turned
towards
her
cousin
but
her
eyes
fixed
on
vacancy
as
might
have
been
expected
she
was
thinking
of
her
brother
and
his
sudden
death
but
other
subjects
crowded
with
that
into
her
mind
and
another
figure
shared
with
him
her
thoughts
she
had
been
induced
to
give
her
guardian
an
unqualified
permission
to
reject
in
her
name
any
further
intercourse
with
frank
and
though
she
had
doubtless
been
induced
to
do
so
by
the
distressing
consciousness
that
she
had
been
slighted
by
him
she
had
cheated
herself
into
the
belief
that
prudence
had
induced
her
to
do
so
she
felt
that
she
was
not
fitted
to
be
a
poor
man
wife
and
that
lord
ballindine
was
as
ill
suited
for
matrimonial
poverty
she
had
therefore
induced
herself
to
give
him
up
she
was
afraid
that
if
she
delayed
doing
so
she
might
herself
be
given
up
now
however
the
case
was
altered
though
she
sincerely
grieved
for
her
brother
she
could
not
but
recollect
the
difference
which
his
death
made
in
her
own
position
she
was
now
a
great
heiress
and
were
she
to
marry
lord
ballindine
if
she
did
not
make
him
a
rich
man
she
would
at
any
rate
free
him
from
all
embarrassment
besides
could
she
give
him
up
now
now
that
she
was
rich
he
would
first
hear
of
her
brother
death
and
her
wealth
and
then
would
immediately
be
told
that
she
had
resolved
to
reject
him
could
she
bear
that
she
should
be
subjected
to
the
construction
which
would
fairly
be
put
upon
her
conduct
if
she
acted
in
this
manner
and
then
again
she
felt
that
she
loved
him
and
she
did
love
him
more
dearly
than
she
was
herself
aware
she
began
to
repent
of
her
easy
submission
to
her
guardian
advice
and
to
think
how
she
could
best
unsay
what
she
had
already
said
she
had
lost
her
brother
could
she
afford
also
to
lose
her
lover
she
had
had
none
she
could
really
love
but
those
two
and
the
tears
again
came
to
her
eyes
and
lady
selina
saw
her
for
the
twentieth
time
that
morning
turn
her
face
to
the
back
of
the
sofa
and
heard
her
sob
lady
selina
was
sitting
at
one
of
the
windows
over
her
frame
she
had
talked
a
great
deal
of
sound
sense
to
fanny
that
morning
about
her
brother
and
now
prepared
to
talk
some
more
preparatory
to
this
she
threw
back
her
long
red
curls
from
her
face
and
wiped
her
red
nose
for
it
was
february
fanny
you
should
occupy
yourself
indeed
you
should
my
dear
it
no
use
your
attempting
your
embroidery
for
your
mind
would
still
wander
to
him
that
is
no
more
you
should
read
indeed
you
should
do
go
on
with
gibbon
i
fetch
it
for
you
only
tell
me
where
you
were
i
could
not
read
selina
i
could
not
think
about
what
i
read
more
than
about
the
work
but
you
should
try
fanny
the
very
attempt
would
be
work
to
your
mind
besides
you
would
be
doing
your
duty
could
all
your
tears
bring
him
back
to
you
can
all
your
sorrow
again
restore
him
to
his
friends
no
and
you
have
great
consolation
fanny
in
reflecting
that
your
remembrance
of
your
brother
is
mixed
with
no
alloy
he
had
not
lived
to
be
contaminated
by
the
heartless
vices
of
that
portion
of
the
world
into
which
he
would
probably
have
been
thrown
he
had
not
become
dissipated
extravagant
and
sensual
this
should
be
a
great
consolation
to
you
it
might
be
thought
that
lady
selina
was
making
sarcastic
allusions
to
her
own
brother
and
to
fanny
lover
but
she
meant
nothing
of
the
kind
her
remarks
were
intended
to
be
sensible
true
and
consolatory
and
they
at
any
rate
did
no
harm
for
fanny
was
thinking
of
something
else
before
she
had
half
finished
her
speech
they
had
both
again
been
silent
for
a
short
time
when
the
door
opened
and
in
came
the
earl
his
usual
pomposity
of
demeanour
was
somewhat
softened
by
a
lachrymose
air
which
in
respect
to
his
ward
grief
he
put
on
as
he
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
and
he
walked
somewhat
more
gently
than
usual
into
the
room
well
fanny
how
are
you
now
he
said
as
he
crept
up
to
her
you
should
brood
over
these
sad
thoughts
your
poor
brother
has
gone
to
a
better
world
we
shall
always
think
of
him
as
one
who
had
felt
no
sorrow
and
been
guilty
of
but
few
faults
he
died
before
he
had
wasted
his
fortune
and
health
as
he
might
have
done
this
will
always
be
a
consolation
it
was
singular
how
nearly
alike
were
the
platitudes
of
the
daughter
and
the
father
the
young
man
had
not
injured
his
name
or
character
in
the
world
and
had
left
his
money
behind
him
and
therefore
his
death
was
less
grievous
fanny
did
not
answer
but
she
sat
upright
on
the
sofa
as
he
came
up
to
her
and
he
then
sat
down
beside
her
perhaps
i
wrong
fanny
to
speak
to
you
on
other
subjects
so
soon
after
the
sad
event
of
which
we
heard
last
night
but
on
the
whole
i
think
it
better
to
do
so
it
is
good
for
you
to
rouse
yourself
to
exert
yourself
to
think
of
other
things
besides
it
will
be
a
comfort
to
you
to
know
that
i
have
already
done
what
i
am
sure
you
strongly
wished
to
have
executed
at
once
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
guardian
to
say
anything
further
to
induce
his
ward
to
listen
she
knew
that
he
was
going
to
speak
about
lord
ballindine
and
she
was
all
attention
i
shall
not
trouble
you
fanny
by
speaking
to
you
now
i
hope
no
said
fanny
with
her
heart
palpitating
if
it
anything
i
ought
to
hear
it
will
be
no
trouble
to
me
why
my
dear
i
do
think
you
ought
to
know
without
loss
of
time
that
lord
ballindine
has
been
with
me
this
morning
fanny
blushed
up
to
her
hair
not
with
shame
but
with
emotion
as
to
what
was
coming
next
i
have
had
a
long
conversation
with
him
continued
the
earl
in
the
and
i
think
i
have
convinced
him
that
it
is
for
your
mutual
happiness
he
paused
for
he
could
condescend
to
tell
a
lie
but
in
his
glib
speechifying
manner
he
was
nearly
falling
into
one
mutual
happiness
was
such
an
appropriate
prudential
phrase
that
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
but
he
corrected
himself
at
least
i
think
i
have
convinced
him
that
it
is
impossible
that
he
should
any
longer
look
upon
miss
wyndham
as
his
future
wife
lord
cashel
paused
for
some
mark
of
approbation
fanny
saw
that
she
was
expected
to
speak
and
therefore
asked
whether
lord
ballindine
was
still
in
the
house
she
listened
tremulously
for
his
answer
for
she
felt
that
if
her
lover
were
to
be
rejected
he
had
a
right
after
what
had
passed
between
them
to
expect
that
she
should
in
person
express
her
resolution
to
him
and
yet
if
she
had
to
see
him
now
could
she
reject
him
could
she
tell
him
that
all
the
vows
that
had
been
made
between
them
were
to
be
as
nothing
no
she
could
only
fall
on
his
shoulder
and
weep
in
his
arms
but
lord
cashel
had
managed
better
than
that
no
fanny
neither
he
nor
i
at
the
present
moment
could
expect
you
could
reasonably
expect
you
to
subject
yourself
to
anything
so
painful
as
an
interview
must
now
have
been
lord
ballindine
has
left
the
house
i
hope
for
the
last
time
at
least
for
many
months
these
words
fell
cold
upon
fanny
ears
did
he
leave
any
any
message
for
me
nothing
of
any
moment
nothing
which
it
can
avail
to
communicate
to
you
he
expressed
his
grief
for
your
brother
death
and
desired
i
should
tell
you
how
grieved
he
was
that
you
should
be
so
afflicted
poor
harry
sobbed
fanny
for
it
was
a
relief
to
cry
again
though
her
tears
were
more
for
her
lover
than
her
brother
poor
harry
they
were
very
fond
of
each
other
i
sure
he
must
have
been
sorry
sure
he
feel
it
and
she
paused
and
sobbed
again
he
had
heard
of
harry
death
then
when
she
said
this
she
had
in
her
mind
none
of
the
dirty
suspicion
that
had
actuated
lord
cashel
but
he
guessed
at
her
feelings
by
his
own
and
answered
accordingly
at
first
i
understood
him
to
say
he
had
but
then
he
seemed
to
wish
to
express
that
he
had
not
my
impression
i
own
is
that
he
must
have
heard
of
it
the
sad
news
must
have
reached
him
fanny
still
did
not
understand
the
earl
the
idea
of
her
lover
coming
after
her
money
immediately
on
her
obtaining
possession
of
it
never
entered
her
mind
she
thought
of
her
wealth
as
far
as
it
might
have
affected
him
but
did
not
dream
of
its
altering
his
conduct
towards
her
and
did
he
seem
unhappy
about
it
she
continued
i
am
sure
it
would
make
him
very
unhappy
he
could
not
have
loved
harry
better
if
he
had
been
his
brother
and
then
she
blushed
again
through
her
tears
as
she
remembered
that
she
had
intended
that
they
should
be
brothers
lord
cashel
did
not
say
anything
more
on
this
head
he
was
fully
convinced
that
lord
ballindine
only
looked
on
the
young
man
death
as
a
windfall
which
he
might
turn
to
his
own
advantage
but
he
thought
it
would
be
a
little
too
strong
to
say
so
outright
just
at
present
it
will
be
a
comfort
for
you
to
know
that
this
matter
is
now
settled
continued
the
earl
and
that
no
one
can
attach
the
slightest
blame
to
you
in
the
matter
lord
ballindine
has
shown
himself
so
very
imprudent
so
very
unfit
in
every
way
for
the
honour
you
once
intended
him
that
no
other
line
of
conduct
was
open
to
you
than
that
which
you
have
wisely
pursued
this
treading
on
the
fallen
was
too
much
for
fanny
i
have
no
right
either
to
speak
or
to
think
ill
of
him
said
she
through
her
tears
and
if
any
one
is
in
the
matter
it
is
he
but
did
he
not
ask
to
see
me
surely
fanny
you
would
not
at
the
present
moment
have
wished
to
see
him
oh
no
it
is
a
great
relief
under
all
the
circumstances
not
having
to
do
so
but
was
he
contented
i
should
be
glad
that
he
were
satisfied
that
he
should
think
i
had
treated
him
harshly
or
rudely
did
he
appear
as
if
he
wished
to
see
me
again
why
he
certainly
did
ask
for
a
last
interview
which
anticipating
your
wishes
i
have
refused
but
was
he
satisfied
did
he
appear
to
think
that
he
had
been
badly
treated
rejected
lovers
answered
the
earl
with
a
stately
smile
seldom
express
much
satisfaction
with
the
terms
of
their
rejection
but
i
can
not
say
that
lord
ballindine
testified
any
strong
emotion
he
rose
from
the
sofa
as
he
said
this
and
then
intending
to
clinch
the
nail
added
as
he
went
to
the
door
to
tell
the
truth
fanny
i
think
lord
ballindine
is
much
more
eager
for
an
alliance
with
your
fair
self
now
than
he
was
a
few
days
back
when
he
could
never
find
a
time
to
leave
his
horses
and
his
friend
mr
blake
either
to
see
his
intended
wife
or
to
pay
lady
cashel
the
usual
courtesy
of
a
morning
visit
he
then
opened
the
door
and
again
closing
it
added
i
think
however
fanny
that
what
has
now
passed
between
us
will
secure
you
from
any
further
annoyance
from
him
lord
cashel
in
this
last
speech
had
greatly
overshot
his
mark
his
object
had
been
to
make
the
separation
between
his
ward
and
her
lover
permanent
and
hitherto
he
had
successfully
appealed
to
her
pride
and
her
judgment
fanny
had
felt
lord
cashel
to
be
right
when
he
told
her
that
she
was
neglected
and
that
frank
was
dissipated
and
in
debt
she
knew
she
should
be
unhappy
as
the
wife
of
a
poor
nobleman
and
she
felt
that
it
would
break
her
proud
heart
to
be
jilted
herself
she
had
therefore
though
unwillingly
still
entirely
agreed
with
her
guardian
as
to
the
expediency
of
breaking
off
the
match
and
had
lord
cashel
been
judicious
he
might
have
confirmed
her
in
this
resolution
but
his
last
thunderbolt
which
had
been
intended
to
crush
lord
ballindine
had
completely
recoiled
upon
himself
fanny
now
instantly
understood
the
allusion
and
raising
her
face
which
was
again
resting
on
her
hands
looked
at
him
with
an
indignant
glance
through
her
tears
lord
cashel
however
had
left
the
room
without
observing
the
indignation
expressed
in
fanny
eyes
but
she
was
indignant
she
knew
frank
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
he
had
come
to
grey
abbey
that
morning
with
no
such
base
motives
as
those
ascribed
to
him
he
might
have
heard
of
harry
death
and
come
there
to
express
his
sorrow
and
offer
that
consolation
which
she
felt
she
could
accept
from
him
sooner
than
from
any
living
creature
or
he
might
have
been
ignorant
of
it
altogether
but
that
he
should
come
there
to
press
his
suit
because
her
brother
was
dead
immediately
after
his
death
was
not
only
impossible
but
the
person
who
could
say
it
was
possible
must
be
false
and
untrue
to
her
her
uncle
could
not
have
believed
it
himself
he
had
basely
pretended
to
believe
it
that
he
might
widen
the
breach
which
he
had
made
fanny
was
alone
in
the
for
her
cousin
had
left
it
as
soon
as
her
father
began
to
talk
about
lord
ballindine
and
she
sat
there
glowering
through
her
tears
for
a
long
time
had
lord
ballindine
been
able
to
know
all
her
thoughts
at
this
moment
he
would
have
felt
little
doubt
as
to
the
ultimate
success
of
his
suit
xiii
father
and
son
lord
cashel
firmly
believed
when
he
left
the
room
that
he
had
shown
great
tact
in
discovering
frank
mercenary
schemes
and
in
laying
them
open
before
fanny
and
that
she
had
firmly
and
finally
made
up
her
mind
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
him
he
had
not
long
been
in
his
customary
chair
in
the
before
he
began
to
feel
a
certain
degree
of
horror
at
the
young
lord
baseness
and
to
think
how
worthily
he
had
executed
his
duty
as
a
guardian
in
saving
miss
wyndham
from
so
sordid
a
suitor
from
thinking
of
his
duties
as
a
guardian
his
mind
not
unnaturally
recurred
to
those
which
were
incumbent
on
him
as
a
father
and
here
nothing
disturbed
his
serenity
it
is
true
that
from
an
appreciation
of
the
lustre
which
would
reflect
back
upon
himself
from
allowing
his
son
to
become
a
decidedly
fashionable
young
man
he
had
encouraged
him
in
extravagance
dissipation
and
heartless
worldliness
he
had
brought
him
up
to
be
supercilious
expensive
unprincipled
and
useless
but
then
he
was
gentlemanlike
dignified
and
sought
after
and
now
the
father
reflected
with
satisfaction
that
if
he
could
accomplish
his
scheme
he
would
pay
his
son
debts
with
his
ward
fortune
and
at
the
same
time
tie
him
down
to
some
degree
of
propriety
and
decorum
by
a
wife
lord
kilcullen
when
about
to
marry
would
be
obliged
to
cashier
his
and
their
expensive
crews
and
though
he
might
not
leave
the
turf
altogether
when
married
he
would
gradually
be
drawn
out
of
turf
society
and
would
doubtless
become
a
good
steady
family
nobleman
like
his
father
why
he
lord
cashel
himself
wise
prudent
and
respectable
as
he
was
example
as
he
knew
himself
to
be
to
all
peers
english
irish
and
scotch
had
had
his
horses
and
his
indiscretions
when
he
was
young
and
then
he
stroked
the
calves
of
his
legs
and
smiled
grimly
for
the
memory
of
his
juvenile
vices
was
pleasant
to
him
lord
cashel
thought
as
he
continued
to
reflect
on
the
matter
that
lord
ballindine
was
certainly
a
sordid
schemer
but
that
his
son
was
a
young
man
of
whom
he
had
just
reason
to
be
proud
and
who
was
worthy
of
a
wife
in
the
shape
of
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
and
then
he
congratulated
himself
on
being
the
most
anxious
of
guardians
and
the
best
of
fathers
and
with
these
comfortable
reflections
the
worthy
peer
strutted
off
through
his
ample
doors
up
his
lofty
stairs
and
away
through
his
long
corridors
to
dress
for
dinner
you
might
have
heard
his
boots
creaking
till
he
got
inside
his
but
you
must
have
owned
that
they
did
so
with
a
most
dignified
cadence
it
was
pleasant
enough
certainly
planning
all
these
things
but
there
would
be
some
little
trouble
in
executing
them
in
the
first
place
lord
kilcullen
though
a
very
good
son
on
the
whole
as
the
father
frequently
remarked
to
himself
was
a
little
fond
of
having
a
will
of
his
own
and
might
object
to
dispense
with
his
and
though
there
was
unfortunately
but
little
doubt
that
the
money
was
indispensably
necessary
to
him
it
was
just
possible
that
he
might
insist
on
having
the
cash
without
his
cousin
however
the
proposal
must
be
made
and
as
the
operations
necessary
to
perfect
the
marriage
would
cause
some
delay
and
the
money
would
certainly
be
wanted
as
soon
as
possible
no
time
was
to
be
lost
lord
kilcullen
was
accordingly
summoned
to
grey
abbey
and
as
he
presumed
his
attendance
was
required
for
the
purpose
of
talking
over
some
method
of
raising
the
wind
he
obeyed
the
i
should
rather
have
said
of
raising
a
storm
for
no
gentle
puff
would
serve
to
waft
him
through
his
present
necessities
down
he
came
to
the
great
delight
of
his
mother
who
thought
him
by
far
the
finest
young
man
of
the
day
though
he
usually
slighted
snubbed
and
ridiculed
her
and
of
his
sister
who
always
hailed
with
dignified
joy
the
return
of
the
eldest
scion
of
her
proud
family
to
the
ancestral
roof
the
earl
was
also
glad
to
find
that
no
previous
engagement
detained
him
that
is
that
he
so
far
sacrificed
his
own
comfort
as
to
leave
tattersall
and
the
of
the
to
come
all
the
way
to
grey
abbey
in
the
county
of
kildare
but
though
the
earl
was
glad
to
see
his
son
he
was
still
a
little
consternated
the
business
interview
could
not
be
postponed
as
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
lord
kilcullen
would
stay
long
at
grey
abbey
during
the
london
season
and
the
father
had
yet
hardly
sufficiently
crammed
himself
for
the
occasion
besides
the
pressure
from
without
must
have
been
very
strong
to
have
produced
so
immediate
a
compliance
with
a
behest
not
uttered
in
a
very
peremptory
manner
or
generally
speaking
to
a
very
obedient
child
on
the
morning
after
his
arrival
the
earl
was
a
little
uneasy
in
his
chair
during
breakfast
it
was
rather
a
sombre
meal
for
fanny
had
by
no
means
recovered
her
spirits
nor
did
she
appear
to
be
in
the
way
to
do
so
the
countess
tried
to
chat
a
little
to
her
son
but
he
hardly
answered
her
and
lady
selina
though
she
was
often
profound
was
never
amusing
lord
cashel
made
sundry
attempts
at
general
conversation
but
as
often
failed
it
was
at
last
however
over
and
the
father
requested
the
son
to
come
with
him
into
the
when
the
fire
was
poked
and
the
chairs
were
drawn
together
over
the
rug
there
were
no
further
preliminaries
which
could
be
decently
introduced
and
the
earl
was
therefore
forced
to
commence
well
kilcullen
i
glad
you
come
to
grey
abbey
i
afraid
however
we
sha
induce
you
to
stay
with
us
long
so
it
as
well
perhaps
to
settle
our
business
at
once
you
would
however
greatly
oblige
your
mother
and
i
sure
i
need
not
add
myself
if
you
could
make
your
arrangements
so
as
to
stay
with
us
till
after
easter
we
could
then
return
together
till
after
easter
my
lord
i
should
be
in
the
hue
and
cry
before
that
time
if
i
was
so
long
absent
from
my
accustomed
haunts
besides
i
should
only
put
out
your
own
arrangements
or
rather
those
of
lady
cashel
there
would
probably
be
no
room
for
me
in
the
family
the
family
coach
wo
go
lord
kilcullen
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
the
state
of
my
affairs
at
present
renders
it
advisable
that
the
family
should
remain
at
grey
abbey
this
season
i
shall
attend
my
parliamentary
duties
alone
this
was
intended
as
a
hit
the
first
at
the
prodigal
son
but
kilcullen
was
too
crafty
to
allow
it
to
tell
he
merely
bowed
his
head
and
opened
his
eyes
to
betoken
his
surprise
at
such
a
decision
and
remained
quiet
indeed
continued
lord
cashel
i
did
not
even
intend
to
have
gone
myself
but
the
unexpected
death
of
harry
wyndham
renders
it
necessary
i
must
put
fanny
affairs
in
a
right
train
poor
harry
did
you
see
much
of
him
during
his
illness
why
no
i
ca
say
i
did
i
not
a
very
good
hand
at
doctoring
or
nursing
i
saw
him
once
since
he
got
his
commission
glittering
with
his
gold
lace
like
a
new
on
a
town
hall
he
had
time
to
polish
the
shine
off
his
death
will
make
a
great
difference
as
far
as
fanny
is
concerned
eh
indeed
it
will
her
fortune
now
is
considerable
a
deuced
pretty
thing
remembering
that
it
all
ready
money
and
that
she
can
touch
it
the
moment
she
of
age
she
entirely
off
with
ballindine
she
oh
entirely
said
the
earl
with
considerable
that
affair
is
entirely
over
i
stated
so
everywhere
publicly
but
i
dare
say
she
give
him
her
money
nevertheless
she
not
the
girl
to
give
over
a
man
if
she
really
fond
of
him
but
my
dear
kilcullen
she
has
authorised
me
to
give
him
a
final
answer
and
i
have
done
so
after
that
you
know
it
would
be
quite
impossible
for
her
to
to
you
see
she
marry
lord
ballindine
had
harry
lived
it
might
have
been
different
but
now
she
got
all
her
brother
money
think
it
a
point
of
honour
to
marry
her
poor
lover
besides
her
staying
this
year
in
the
country
will
be
in
his
favour
she
see
no
one
here
and
she
want
something
to
think
of
i
understand
he
has
altogether
thrown
himself
into
blake
hands
the
keenest
fellow
in
ireland
with
as
much
mercy
as
a
foxhound
he
a
positive
fool
is
ballindine
i
afraid
he
is
i
afraid
he
is
and
you
may
be
sure
i
too
fond
of
fanny
that
is
i
have
too
much
regard
for
the
trust
reposed
in
me
to
allow
her
to
throw
herself
away
upon
him
that
all
very
well
but
what
can
you
do
why
not
allow
him
to
see
her
and
i
another
plan
in
my
head
for
her
ah
but
the
thing
is
to
put
the
plan
into
head
i
be
sorry
to
hear
of
a
fine
girl
like
fanny
wyndham
breaking
her
heart
in
a
barrack
in
connaught
without
money
to
pay
a
schoolmaster
to
teach
her
children
to
spell
but
i
too
many
troubles
of
my
own
to
think
of
just
at
present
to
care
much
about
hers
and
the
son
and
heir
got
up
and
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
put
his
arms
under
his
upon
my
soul
my
lord
i
never
was
so
hard
up
in
my
life
lord
cashel
now
prepared
himself
for
action
the
first
shot
was
fired
and
he
must
go
on
with
the
battle
so
i
hear
kilcullen
and
yet
during
the
last
four
years
you
had
nearly
double
your
allowance
and
before
that
i
paid
every
farthing
you
owed
within
the
last
five
years
you
had
nearly
forty
thousand
pounds
supposing
you
had
younger
brothers
lord
kilcullen
supposing
that
i
had
had
six
or
eight
sons
instead
of
only
one
what
would
you
have
done
how
then
would
you
have
paid
your
debts
fate
having
exempted
me
and
your
lordship
from
so
severe
a
curse
i
have
never
turned
my
mind
to
reflect
what
i
might
have
done
under
such
an
infliction
or
supposing
i
had
chosen
myself
to
indulge
in
those
expensive
habits
which
would
have
absorbed
my
income
and
left
me
unable
to
do
more
for
you
than
many
other
noblemen
in
my
position
do
for
their
sons
do
you
ever
reflect
how
impossible
it
would
then
have
been
for
me
to
have
helped
you
out
of
your
difficulties
i
feel
as
truly
grateful
for
your
in
this
respect
as
i
do
in
that
of
my
brethren
lord
cashel
saw
that
he
was
laughed
at
and
he
looked
angry
but
he
did
not
want
to
quarrel
with
his
son
so
he
continued
jervis
writes
me
word
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
thirty
thousand
pounds
should
be
paid
for
you
at
once
or
that
your
remaining
in
london
or
in
fact
in
the
country
at
all
is
quite
out
of
the
question
indeed
my
lord
i
afraid
jervis
is
right
thirty
thousand
pounds
are
you
aware
what
your
income
is
why
hardly
i
know
jervis
takes
care
that
i
never
see
much
of
it
do
you
mean
that
you
do
receive
it
oh
i
do
not
at
all
doubt
its
accurate
payment
i
mean
to
say
that
i
do
often
have
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
much
of
it
at
the
right
side
of
my
banker
book
thirty
thousand
pounds
and
will
that
sum
set
you
completely
free
in
the
world
i
am
sorry
to
say
it
will
not
nor
nearly
then
lord
kilcullen
said
the
earl
with
most
severe
but
still
most
courteous
dignity
may
i
trouble
you
to
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
what
at
the
present
moment
you
do
owe
i
afraid
i
could
not
do
so
with
any
accuracy
but
it
is
more
than
double
the
sum
you
have
named
do
you
mean
that
you
have
no
schedule
of
your
debts
no
means
of
acquainting
me
with
the
amount
how
can
you
expect
that
i
can
assist
you
when
you
think
it
too
much
trouble
to
make
yourself
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
state
of
your
own
affairs
a
list
could
certainly
be
made
out
if
i
had
any
prospect
of
being
able
to
settle
the
amount
if
your
lordship
can
undertake
to
do
so
at
once
i
will
undertake
to
hand
you
a
correct
list
of
the
sums
due
before
i
leave
grey
abbey
i
presume
you
would
not
require
to
know
exactly
to
whom
all
the
items
were
owing
this
effrontery
was
too
much
and
lord
cashel
was
very
near
to
losing
his
temper
upon
my
honour
kilcullen
you
cool
very
cool
you
come
upon
me
to
pay
heaven
knows
how
many
thousands
more
money
i
know
than
able
to
raise
and
you
condescendingly
tell
me
that
you
will
trouble
yourself
so
far
as
to
let
me
know
how
much
money
i
am
to
give
you
but
that
i
am
not
to
know
what
is
done
with
it
no
if
i
am
to
pay
your
debts
again
i
will
do
it
through
jervis
pray
remember
replied
lord
kilcullen
not
at
all
disturbed
from
his
equanimity
that
i
have
not
proposed
that
you
should
pay
my
debts
without
knowing
where
the
money
went
and
also
that
i
have
not
yet
asked
you
to
pay
them
at
all
who
then
do
you
expect
will
pay
them
i
can
assure
you
i
should
be
glad
to
be
relieved
from
the
honour
i
merely
said
that
i
had
not
yet
made
any
proposition
respecting
them
of
course
i
expect
your
assistance
failing
you
i
have
no
resource
but
the
jews
i
should
regret
to
put
the
property
into
their
hands
especially
as
hitherto
i
have
not
raised
money
on
post
obits
footnote
post
obit
a
loan
that
need
not
be
repaid
until
the
death
of
a
specified
individual
usually
someone
from
whom
the
borrower
expected
to
inherit
enough
to
repay
the
loan
at
any
rate
i
glad
of
that
said
the
father
willing
to
admit
any
excuse
for
returning
to
his
good
humour
that
would
be
ruin
and
i
hope
that
anything
short
of
that
may
be
may
be
may
be
done
something
with
the
expression
was
not
dignified
and
it
pained
the
earl
to
make
it
but
it
was
expressive
and
he
did
wish
at
once
to
say
that
he
had
a
proposal
for
paying
off
his
son
debts
but
now
kilcullen
tell
me
fairly
in
round
figures
what
do
you
think
you
owe
as
near
as
you
can
guess
without
going
to
pen
and
paper
you
know
well
my
lord
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
make
a
proposition
to
you
if
you
will
hand
over
to
mr
jervis
fifty
thousand
pounds
for
him
to
pay
such
claims
as
have
already
been
made
upon
him
as
your
agent
and
such
other
debts
as
i
may
have
sent
in
to
him
and
if
you
will
give
myself
thirty
thousand
to
pay
such
debts
as
i
do
not
choose
to
have
paid
by
an
agent
i
will
undertake
to
have
everything
settled
eighty
thousand
pounds
in
four
years
why
kilcullen
what
have
you
done
with
it
where
has
it
gone
you
have
five
thousand
no
house
to
keep
up
no
property
to
support
no
tenants
to
satisfy
no
rates
to
pay
five
thousand
for
your
own
personal
expenses
and
in
four
years
you
have
got
eighty
thousand
in
debt
the
property
never
can
stand
that
you
know
it
never
can
stand
at
that
rate
why
kilcullen
what
have
you
done
with
it
mr
crockford
has
a
portion
of
it
and
john
scott
has
some
of
it
a
great
deal
of
it
is
scattered
rather
widely
so
widely
that
it
would
be
difficult
now
to
trace
it
but
my
lord
it
has
gone
i
wo
deny
that
the
greater
portion
of
it
has
been
lost
at
play
or
on
the
turf
i
trust
i
may
in
future
be
more
fortunate
and
more
cautious
i
trust
so
i
trust
so
indeed
eighty
thousand
pounds
and
do
you
think
i
can
raise
such
a
sum
as
that
at
a
week
warning
indeed
i
have
no
doubt
as
to
your
being
able
to
do
so
it
may
be
another
question
whether
you
are
willing
i
am
not
i
am
not
able
said
the
libelled
father
as
you
know
well
enough
the
incumbrances
on
the
property
take
more
than
a
quarter
of
my
income
there
can
nevertheless
be
no
doubt
of
your
being
able
to
have
the
money
and
that
at
once
if
you
chose
to
go
into
the
market
for
it
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
mr
jervis
could
get
it
for
you
at
once
at
five
per
cent
four
thousand
gone
for
ever
from
the
property
and
what
security
am
i
to
have
that
the
same
sacrifice
will
not
be
again
incurred
after
another
lapse
of
four
years
you
can
have
no
security
my
lord
against
my
being
in
debt
you
can
however
have
every
security
that
you
will
not
again
pay
my
debts
in
your
own
resolution
i
trust
however
that
i
have
some
experience
to
prevent
my
again
falling
into
so
disagreeable
a
predicament
i
think
i
have
heard
your
lordship
say
that
you
incurred
some
unnecessary
expenses
yourself
in
london
before
your
marriage
i
wish
kilcullen
that
you
had
never
exceeded
your
income
more
than
i
did
mine
but
it
is
no
use
talking
any
further
on
this
subject
i
can
not
and
i
will
not
i
can
not
in
justice
either
to
myself
or
to
you
borrow
this
money
for
you
nor
if
i
could
should
i
think
it
right
to
do
so
then
what
the
devil
the
use
of
talking
about
it
so
long
said
the
dutiful
son
hastily
jumping
up
from
the
chair
in
which
he
had
again
sat
down
did
you
bring
me
down
to
grey
abbey
merely
to
tell
me
that
you
knew
of
my
difficulties
and
that
you
could
do
nothing
to
assist
me
now
do
put
yourself
into
a
passion
pray
do
said
the
father
a
little
frightened
by
the
sudden
ebullition
if
you
sit
down
and
listen
to
me
i
tell
you
what
i
propose
i
did
not
send
for
you
here
without
intending
to
point
out
to
you
some
method
of
extricating
yourself
from
your
present
pecuniary
embarrassment
and
if
you
have
any
wish
to
give
up
your
course
of
i
must
say
reckless
profusion
and
commence
that
upright
and
distinguished
career
which
i
still
hope
to
see
you
take
you
will
i
think
own
that
my
plan
is
both
a
safer
and
a
more
expedient
one
than
that
which
you
have
proposed
it
is
quite
time
for
you
now
to
abandon
the
expensive
follies
of
youth
and
lord
cashel
was
getting
into
a
delightfully
dignified
tone
and
felt
himself
prepared
for
a
good
burst
of
eloquence
but
his
son
looked
impatient
and
as
he
could
not
take
such
liberty
with
him
as
he
could
with
lord
ballindine
he
came
to
the
point
at
once
and
ended
abruptly
by
saying
and
get
married
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
my
wife
to
pay
my
debts
why
not
exactly
that
but
as
of
course
you
could
not
marry
any
woman
but
a
woman
with
a
large
fortune
that
would
follow
as
a
matter
of
consequence
your
lordship
proposes
the
fortune
not
as
the
first
object
of
my
affection
but
merely
as
a
corollary
but
perhaps
it
will
be
as
well
that
you
should
finish
your
proposition
before
i
make
any
remarks
on
the
subject
and
lord
kilcullen
sat
down
with
a
look
of
listless
indifference
well
kilcullen
i
have
latterly
been
thinking
much
about
you
and
so
has
your
poor
mother
she
is
very
uneasy
that
you
should
still
still
be
unmarried
and
jervis
has
written
to
me
very
strongly
you
see
it
is
quite
necessary
that
something
should
be
done
or
we
shall
both
be
ruined
now
if
i
did
raise
this
sum
and
i
really
could
not
do
it
i
do
think
i
could
manage
it
just
at
present
but
even
if
i
did
it
would
only
be
encouraging
you
to
go
on
just
in
the
same
way
again
now
if
you
were
to
marry
your
whole
course
of
life
would
be
altered
and
you
would
become
at
the
same
time
more
respectable
and
more
happy
that
would
depend
a
good
deal
upon
circumstances
i
should
think
oh
i
am
sure
you
would
you
are
just
the
same
sort
of
fellow
i
was
when
at
your
age
and
i
was
much
happier
after
i
was
married
so
i
know
it
now
you
see
your
cousin
has
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
in
fact
something
more
than
that
what
fanny
poor
ballindine
so
that
the
way
with
him
is
it
when
i
was
contradicting
the
rumour
of
his
marriage
with
fanny
i
little
thought
that
i
was
to
be
his
rival
at
any
rate
i
shall
have
to
shoot
him
first
you
might
at
any
rate
confine
yourself
to
sense
lord
kilcullen
when
i
am
taking
so
much
pains
to
talk
sensibly
to
you
on
a
subject
which
i
presume
can
not
but
interest
you
indeed
my
lord
i
all
attention
and
i
do
intend
to
talk
sensibly
when
i
say
that
i
think
you
are
proposing
to
treat
ballindine
very
ill
the
world
will
think
well
of
your
turning
him
adrift
on
the
score
of
the
match
being
an
imprudent
one
but
it
wo
speak
so
leniently
of
you
if
you
expel
him
as
soon
as
your
ward
becomes
an
heiress
to
make
way
for
your
own
son
you
know
that
i
not
thinking
of
doing
so
i
long
seen
that
lord
ballindine
would
not
make
a
fitting
husband
for
fanny
long
before
harry
died
and
you
think
that
i
shall
indeed
i
do
i
think
she
will
be
lucky
to
get
you
i
flattered
into
silence
pray
go
on
you
will
be
an
earl
a
peer
and
a
man
of
property
what
would
she
become
if
she
married
lord
ballindine
oh
you
are
quite
right
go
on
i
wonder
it
never
occurred
to
her
before
to
set
her
cap
at
me
now
do
be
serious
i
wonder
how
you
can
joke
on
such
a
subject
with
all
your
debts
i
sure
i
feel
them
heavy
enough
if
you
do
you
see
lord
ballindine
was
refused
i
may
say
he
was
refused
before
we
heard
about
that
poor
boy
unfortunate
death
it
was
the
very
morning
we
heard
of
it
three
or
four
hours
before
the
messenger
came
that
fanny
had
expressed
her
resolution
to
declare
it
off
and
commissioned
me
to
tell
him
so
and
therefore
of
course
the
two
things
ca
have
the
remotest
reference
to
each
other
i
see
there
are
or
have
been
two
fanny
wyndhams
separate
persons
though
both
wards
of
your
lordship
lord
ballindine
was
engaged
to
the
girl
who
had
a
brother
but
he
can
have
no
possible
concern
with
fanny
wyndham
the
heiress
who
has
no
brother
how
can
you
be
so
unfeeling
but
you
may
pay
your
debts
in
your
own
way
you
wo
ever
listen
to
what
i
have
to
say
i
should
have
thought
that
as
your
father
i
might
have
considered
myself
entitled
to
more
respect
from
you
indeed
my
lord
i
all
respect
and
attention
and
i
wo
say
one
more
word
till
you
finished
well
you
must
see
there
can
be
no
objection
on
the
score
of
lord
ballindine
oh
none
at
all
and
then
where
could
fanny
wish
for
a
better
match
than
yourself
it
would
be
a
great
thing
for
her
and
the
match
would
be
in
all
things
so
so
respectable
and
just
what
it
ought
to
be
and
your
mother
would
be
so
delighted
and
so
should
i
and
her
fortune
would
so
nicely
pay
all
my
debts
exactly
of
course
i
should
take
care
to
have
your
present
income
five
thousand
a
year
settled
on
her
in
the
shape
of
jointure
and
i
sure
that
would
be
treating
her
handsomely
the
interest
of
her
fortune
would
not
be
more
than
that
and
what
should
we
live
on
why
of
course
i
should
continue
your
present
allowance
and
you
think
that
that
which
i
have
found
so
insufficient
for
myself
would
be
enough
for
both
of
us
you
must
make
it
enough
kilcullen
in
order
that
there
may
be
something
left
to
enable
you
to
keep
up
your
title
when
i
am
gone
by
this
time
lord
kilcullen
appeared
to
be
as
serious
and
nearly
as
solemn
as
his
father
and
he
sat
for
a
considerable
time
musing
till
his
father
said
well
kilcullen
will
you
take
my
advice
it
impracticable
my
lord
in
the
first
place
the
money
must
be
paid
immediately
and
considerable
delay
must
occur
before
i
could
even
offer
to
miss
wyndham
and
in
the
next
place
were
i
to
do
so
i
am
sure
she
would
refuse
me
why
there
must
be
some
delay
of
course
but
i
suppose
if
i
passed
my
word
through
jervis
for
so
much
of
the
debts
as
are
immediate
that
a
settlement
might
be
made
whereby
they
might
stand
over
for
twelve
months
with
interest
of
course
as
to
refusing
you
it
not
at
all
likely
where
would
she
look
for
a
better
offer
i
do
know
much
of
my
cousin
but
i
do
think
she
exactly
the
girl
to
take
a
man
because
he
a
good
match
for
her
perhaps
not
but
then
you
know
you
understand
women
so
well
and
would
have
such
opportunities
you
would
be
sure
to
make
yourself
agreeable
to
her
with
very
little
effort
on
your
part
yes
poor
thing
she
would
be
delivered
over
ready
bound
into
the
lion
den
and
then
the
young
man
sat
silent
again
for
some
time
turning
the
matter
over
in
his
mind
at
last
he
said
well
my
lord
i
am
a
considerate
and
a
dutiful
son
and
i
will
agree
to
your
proposition
but
i
must
saddle
it
with
conditions
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
sum
which
i
suggested
should
be
paid
through
your
agent
could
be
arranged
to
be
paid
in
a
year
or
eighteen
months
by
your
making
yourself
responsible
for
it
and
i
would
undertake
to
indemnify
you
but
the
thirty
thousand
pounds
i
must
have
at
once
i
must
return
to
london
with
the
power
of
raising
it
there
without
delay
this
also
i
would
repay
you
out
of
fanny
fortune
i
would
then
undertake
to
use
my
best
endeavours
to
effect
a
union
with
your
ward
but
i
most
positively
will
not
agree
to
this
nor
have
any
hand
in
the
matter
unless
i
am
put
in
immediate
possession
of
the
sum
i
have
named
and
unless
you
will
agree
to
double
my
income
as
soon
as
i
am
married
to
both
these
propositions
the
earl
at
first
refused
to
accede
but
his
son
was
firm
then
lord
cashel
agreed
to
put
him
in
immediate
possession
of
the
sum
of
money
he
required
but
would
not
hear
of
increasing
his
income
they
argued
discussed
and
quarrelled
over
the
matter
for
a
long
time
till
at
last
the
anxious
father
in
his
passion
told
his
son
that
he
might
go
his
own
way
and
that
he
would
take
no
further
trouble
to
help
so
unconscionable
a
child
lord
kilcullen
rejoined
by
threatening
immediately
to
throw
the
whole
of
the
property
which
was
entailed
on
himself
into
the
hands
of
the
jews
long
they
argued
and
bargained
till
each
was
surprised
at
the
obstinacy
of
the
other
they
ended
however
by
splitting
the
difference
and
it
was
agreed
that
lord
cashel
was
at
once
to
hand
over
thirty
thousand
pounds
and
to
take
his
son
bond
for
the
amount
that
the
other
debts
were
to
stand
over
till
fanny
money
was
forthcoming
and
that
the
income
of
the
newly
married
pair
was
to
be
seven
thousand
five
hundred
at
least
thought
lord
kilcullen
to
himself
as
he
shook
hands
with
his
father
at
the
termination
of
the
interview
i
have
not
done
so
badly
for
those
infernal
dogs
will
be
silenced
and
i
shall
get
the
money
i
could
not
have
gone
back
without
that
i
can
go
on
with
the
marriage
or
not
as
i
may
choose
hereafter
it
wo
be
a
bad
speculation
however
to
do
lord
cashel
justice
he
did
not
intend
cheating
his
son
nor
did
he
suspect
his
son
of
an
intention
to
cheat
him
but
the
generation
was
deteriorating
xiv
the
countess
it
was
delightful
to
see
on
what
good
terms
the
earl
and
his
son
met
that
evening
at
dinner
the
latter
even
went
so
far
as
to
be
decently
civil
to
his
mother
and
was
quite
attentive
to
fanny
she
however
did
not
seem
to
appreciate
the
compliment
it
was
now
a
fortnight
since
she
had
heard
of
her
brother
death
and
during
the
whole
of
that
time
she
had
been
silent
unhappy
and
fretful
not
a
word
more
had
been
said
to
her
about
lord
ballindine
nor
had
she
as
yet
spoken
about
him
to
any
one
but
she
had
been
thinking
about
little
else
and
had
ascertained
at
least
so
she
thought
that
she
could
never
be
happy
unless
she
were
reconciled
to
him
the
more
she
brooded
over
the
subject
the
more
she
felt
convinced
that
such
was
the
case
she
could
not
think
how
she
had
ever
been
induced
to
sanction
by
her
name
such
an
unwarrantable
proceeding
as
the
unceremonious
dismissal
of
a
man
to
whom
her
troth
had
been
plighted
merely
because
he
had
not
called
to
see
her
as
for
his
not
writing
she
was
aware
that
lord
cashel
had
recommended
that
till
she
was
of
age
they
should
not
correspond
as
she
thought
the
matter
over
in
her
own
room
long
hour
after
hour
she
became
angry
with
herself
for
having
been
talked
into
a
feeling
of
anger
for
him
what
right
had
she
to
be
angry
because
he
kept
horses
she
could
not
expect
him
to
put
himself
into
lord
cashel
indeed
she
thought
she
would
have
liked
him
less
if
he
had
done
so
and
now
to
reject
him
just
when
circumstances
put
it
in
her
power
to
enable
her
to
free
him
from
his
embarrassments
and
live
a
manner
becoming
his
station
what
must
frank
think
of
her
for
he
could
not
but
suppose
that
her
rejection
had
been
caused
by
her
unexpected
inheritance
in
the
course
of
the
fortnight
she
made
up
her
mind
that
all
lord
cashel
had
said
to
lord
ballindine
should
be
unsaid
but
who
was
to
do
it
it
would
be
a
most
unpleasant
task
to
perform
and
one
which
she
was
aware
her
guardian
would
be
most
unwilling
to
undertake
she
fully
resolved
that
she
would
do
it
herself
if
she
could
find
no
fitting
ambassador
to
undertake
the
task
though
that
would
be
a
step
to
which
she
would
fain
not
be
driven
at
one
time
she
absolutely
thought
of
asking
her
cousin
kilcullen
about
it
this
was
just
before
his
leaving
grey
abbey
he
seemed
so
much
more
civil
and
kind
than
usual
but
then
she
knew
so
little
of
him
and
so
little
liked
what
she
did
know
that
scheme
therefore
was
given
up
lady
selina
was
so
cold
and
prudent
would
talk
to
her
so
much
about
propriety
and
that
she
could
not
make
a
confidante
of
her
no
one
could
talk
to
selina
on
any
subject
more
immediately
interesting
than
a
roman
emperor
or
a
pattern
for
fanny
felt
that
she
would
not
be
equal
herself
to
going
boldly
to
lord
cashel
and
desiring
him
to
inform
lord
ballindine
that
he
had
been
mistaken
in
the
view
he
had
taken
of
his
ward
wishes
no
that
was
impossible
such
a
proceeding
would
probably
bring
on
a
fit
of
apoplexy
there
was
no
one
else
to
whom
she
could
apply
but
her
aunt
lady
cashel
was
a
very
old
woman
who
slept
the
greatest
portion
of
her
time
and
knitted
through
the
rest
of
her
existence
she
did
not
take
a
prominent
part
in
any
of
the
important
doings
of
grey
abbey
and
though
lord
cashel
constantly
referred
to
her
for
he
thought
it
respectable
to
do
so
no
one
regarded
her
much
fanny
felt
however
that
she
would
neither
scold
her
ridicule
her
nor
refuse
to
listen
to
lady
cashel
therefore
at
last
she
went
for
assistance
her
ladyship
always
passed
the
morning
after
breakfast
in
a
room
adjoining
her
own
in
which
she
daily
held
deep
debate
with
griffiths
her
factotum
respecting
household
affairs
and
her
own
little
ailments
and
cossetings
griffiths
luckily
was
a
woman
of
much
the
same
tastes
as
her
ladyship
only
somewhat
of
a
more
active
temperament
and
they
were
most
stedfast
friends
it
was
such
a
comfort
to
lady
cashel
to
have
some
one
to
whom
she
could
twaddle
the
morning
after
lord
kilcullen
departure
fanny
knocked
at
her
door
and
was
asked
to
come
in
the
countess
as
usual
was
in
her
easy
chair
with
the
in
her
lap
and
griffiths
was
seated
at
the
table
pulling
about
threads
and
keeping
her
ladyship
awake
by
small
talk
i
afraid
i
disturbing
you
aunt
said
fanny
but
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
for
a
minute
or
two
good
morning
mrs
griffiths
oh
no
you
wo
disturb
me
fanny
i
was
a
little
busy
this
morning
for
i
wanted
to
finish
this
side
of
the
you
see
what
a
deal
done
and
the
countess
lugged
up
a
whole
heap
of
miscellaneous
worsted
from
a
basket
just
under
her
arm
and
i
must
finish
it
by
or
i
sha
get
the
other
done
i
do
know
when
but
still
i
plenty
of
time
to
attend
to
you
footnote
annunciation
day
march
then
i
go
down
my
lady
and
see
about
getting
the
syrup
boiled
said
griffiths
good
morning
miss
wyndham
do
but
mind
you
come
up
again
immediately
i
ring
the
bell
when
miss
wyndham
is
going
and
pray
do
leave
me
alone
now
no
my
lady
not
a
moment
and
griffiths
escaped
to
the
syrup
fanny
heart
beat
quick
and
hard
as
she
sat
down
on
the
sofa
opposite
to
her
aunt
it
was
impossible
for
any
one
to
be
afraid
of
lady
cashel
there
was
so
very
little
about
her
that
could
inspire
awe
but
then
what
she
had
to
say
was
so
very
disagreeable
to
say
if
she
had
had
to
tell
her
tale
out
loud
merely
to
the
empty
easy
chair
it
would
have
been
a
dreadful
undertaking
well
fanny
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
sure
you
look
very
nice
in
your
bombazine
and
it
very
nicely
made
up
who
was
it
made
it
for
you
i
got
it
down
from
dublin
aunt
from
foley
oh
i
remember
so
you
told
me
griffiths
has
a
niece
makes
those
things
up
very
well
but
then
she
lives
at
namptwich
and
one
send
to
england
for
it
i
had
such
a
quantity
of
mourning
by
me
i
did
get
any
made
up
new
else
i
think
i
must
have
sent
for
her
my
dear
aunt
i
am
very
unhappy
about
something
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
i
afraid
though
it
will
give
you
a
great
deal
of
trouble
good
gracious
fanny
what
is
it
is
it
about
poor
harry
i
sure
i
grieved
about
him
more
than
i
can
tell
no
aunt
he
gone
now
and
time
is
the
only
cure
for
that
grief
i
know
i
must
bear
that
without
complaining
but
aunt
i
feel
i
think
that
is
that
i
used
lord
ballindine
very
good
gracious
me
my
love
i
thought
lord
cashel
had
managed
all
that
i
thought
that
was
all
settled
you
know
he
would
keep
those
horrid
horses
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
and
what
more
could
you
do
than
just
let
lord
cashel
settle
it
yes
but
aunt
you
see
i
had
engaged
myself
to
lord
ballindine
and
i
do
think
in
fact
oh
aunt
i
did
not
wish
to
break
my
word
to
lord
ballindine
and
i
am
very
very
sorry
for
what
has
been
done
and
fanny
was
again
in
tears
but
my
dear
fanny
said
the
countess
so
far
excited
as
to
commence
rising
from
her
seat
the
attempt
however
was
abandoned
when
she
felt
the
ill
effects
of
the
labour
to
which
she
was
exposing
herself
but
my
dear
fanny
what
would
you
have
it
done
now
you
know
and
really
it
for
the
best
oh
but
dear
aunt
i
must
get
somebody
to
see
him
i
been
thinking
about
it
ever
since
he
was
here
with
my
uncle
i
would
let
him
think
that
i
broke
it
all
off
merely
because
because
of
poor
money
and
fanny
sobbed
away
dreadfully
but
you
do
want
to
marry
him
said
the
naïve
countess
now
fanny
did
want
to
marry
him
though
she
hardly
liked
saying
so
even
to
lady
cashel
you
know
i
promised
him
i
would
said
she
and
what
will
he
think
of
me
what
must
he
think
of
me
to
throw
him
off
so
cruelly
so
harshly
after
all
that
past
oh
aunt
i
must
see
him
again
i
know
something
of
human
nature
replied
the
aunt
and
if
you
do
i
tell
you
it
will
end
in
your
being
engaged
to
him
again
you
know
off
now
come
my
dear
do
think
so
much
about
it
i
sure
lord
cashel
would
do
anything
cruel
or
harsh
oh
i
must
see
him
again
whatever
comes
of
it
and
then
she
paused
for
a
considerable
time
during
which
the
bewildered
old
lady
was
thinking
what
she
could
do
to
relieve
her
sensitive
niece
dear
dear
aunt
i
do
want
to
deceive
you
and
fanny
springing
up
knelt
at
her
aunt
feet
and
looked
up
into
her
face
i
do
love
him
i
always
loved
him
and
i
can
not
can
not
quarrel
with
him
and
then
she
burst
out
crying
vehemently
hiding
her
face
in
the
countess
lap
lady
cashel
was
quite
overwhelmed
fanny
was
usually
so
much
more
collected
than
herself
that
her
present
prostration
both
of
feeling
and
body
was
dreadful
to
see
suppose
she
was
to
go
into
hysterics
there
they
would
be
alone
and
lady
cashel
felt
that
she
had
not
strength
to
ring
the
bell
but
my
dear
fanny
oh
dear
oh
dear
this
is
very
dreadful
but
fanny
he
gone
away
now
lift
up
your
face
fanny
for
you
frighten
me
well
i
sure
i
do
anything
for
you
perhaps
he
would
mind
coming
back
again
he
always
was
very
i
sure
i
always
liked
lord
ballindine
very
much
only
he
would
have
all
those
horses
but
i
sure
if
you
wish
it
i
should
be
very
glad
to
see
him
marry
you
only
you
know
you
must
wait
some
time
because
of
poor
harry
and
i
sure
i
do
know
how
you
manage
with
lord
cashel
dear
aunt
i
want
you
to
speak
to
lord
cashel
when
i
was
angry
because
i
thought
frank
did
come
here
as
he
might
have
done
i
consented
that
my
uncle
should
break
off
the
match
besides
then
you
know
we
should
have
had
so
little
between
us
but
i
did
know
then
how
well
i
loved
him
indeed
indeed
aunt
i
can
not
bring
my
heart
to
quarrel
with
him
and
i
am
quite
sure
he
would
never
wish
to
quarrel
with
me
will
you
go
to
my
uncle
tell
him
that
i
changed
my
mind
tell
him
that
i
was
a
foolish
girl
and
did
not
know
my
mind
but
tell
him
i
be
friends
with
frank
again
well
of
course
i
do
what
you
wish
me
indeed
i
would
do
anything
for
you
fanny
as
if
you
were
one
of
my
own
but
really
i
know
good
gracious
what
am
i
to
say
to
him
would
it
be
better
fanny
if
you
were
to
go
to
him
yourself
oh
no
aunt
pray
do
you
tell
him
first
i
could
go
to
him
besides
he
would
do
anything
for
you
you
know
i
want
you
to
go
to
him
do
now
dear
aunt
and
tell
him
not
from
me
but
from
yourself
how
very
very
much
i
that
is
how
very
very
but
you
will
know
what
to
say
only
frank
must
come
back
again
well
fanny
dear
i
go
to
lord
cashel
or
perhaps
he
mind
coming
here
ring
the
bell
for
me
dear
but
i
sure
he
be
very
angry
i
just
write
a
line
and
ask
lord
ballindine
to
come
and
dine
here
and
let
him
settle
it
all
himself
only
i
do
think
lord
cashel
would
like
it
griffiths
answered
the
summons
and
was
despatched
to
the
to
tell
his
lordship
that
her
ladyship
would
be
greatly
obliged
if
he
would
step
upstairs
to
her
for
a
minute
or
two
and
as
soon
as
griffiths
was
gone
on
her
errand
fanny
fled
to
her
own
apartment
leaving
her
aunt
in
a
very
bewildered
and
pitiable
state
of
mind
and
there
she
waited
with
palpitating
heart
and
weeping
eyes
the
effects
of
the
interview
she
was
dreadfully
nervous
for
she
felt
certain
that
she
would
be
summoned
before
her
uncle
hitherto
she
alone
in
all
the
house
had
held
him
in
no
kind
of
awe
indeed
her
respect
for
her
uncle
had
not
been
of
the
most
exalted
kind
but
now
she
felt
she
was
afraid
of
him
she
remained
in
her
room
much
longer
than
she
thought
it
would
have
taken
her
aunt
to
explain
what
she
had
to
say
at
last
however
she
heard
footsteps
in
the
corridor
and
griffiths
knocked
at
the
door
her
aunt
would
be
obliged
by
her
stepping
into
her
room
she
tried
not
to
look
disconcerted
and
asked
if
lord
cashel
were
still
there
she
was
told
that
he
was
and
she
felt
that
she
had
to
muster
up
all
her
courage
to
encounter
him
when
she
went
into
the
room
lady
cashel
was
still
in
her
but
the
chair
seemed
to
lend
none
of
its
easiness
to
its
owner
she
was
sitting
upright
with
her
hands
on
her
two
knees
and
she
looked
perplexed
distressed
and
unhappy
lord
cashel
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
and
fanny
had
never
seen
his
face
look
so
black
he
really
seemed
for
the
time
to
have
given
over
acting
to
have
thrown
aside
his
dignity
and
to
be
natural
and
in
earnest
lady
cashel
began
the
conversation
oh
fanny
she
said
you
must
really
overcome
all
this
sensitiveness
you
really
must
i
spoken
to
your
uncle
and
quite
impossible
and
very
unwise
and
indeed
it
ca
be
done
at
all
in
fact
lord
ballindine
is
by
any
means
the
sort
of
person
i
supposed
fanny
knit
her
brows
a
little
at
this
and
felt
somewhat
less
humble
than
she
did
before
she
knew
she
should
get
indignant
if
her
uncle
abused
her
lover
and
that
if
she
did
her
courage
would
rise
in
proportion
her
aunt
continued
your
uncle
very
kind
about
it
and
says
he
can
of
course
forgive
your
feeling
a
little
out
of
sorts
just
at
present
and
i
sure
so
can
i
and
i
sure
i
do
anything
to
make
you
happy
but
as
for
making
it
all
up
with
lord
ballindine
again
indeed
it
can
not
be
thought
of
fanny
and
so
your
uncle
will
tell
you
and
then
lord
cashel
opened
his
oracular
mouth
for
the
purpose
of
doing
so
really
fanny
this
is
the
most
unaccountable
thing
i
ever
heard
of
but
you
better
sit
down
while
i
speak
to
you
and
fanny
sat
down
on
the
sofa
i
think
i
understood
you
rightly
when
you
desired
me
less
than
a
month
ago
to
inform
lord
ballindine
that
circumstances
that
is
his
own
conduct
obliged
you
to
decline
the
honour
of
his
alliance
did
you
not
do
so
spontaneously
and
of
your
own
accord
certainly
uncle
i
agreed
to
take
your
advice
though
i
did
so
most
unwillingly
had
i
not
your
authority
for
desiring
him
i
wo
say
to
discontinue
his
visits
for
that
he
had
long
done
but
to
give
up
his
pretensions
to
your
hand
did
you
not
authorise
me
to
do
so
i
believe
i
did
but
uncle
and
i
have
done
as
you
desired
me
and
now
fanny
that
i
have
done
so
now
that
i
have
fully
explained
to
him
what
you
taught
me
to
believe
were
your
wishes
on
the
subject
will
you
tell
me
for
i
really
think
your
aunt
must
have
misunderstood
you
what
it
is
that
you
wish
me
to
do
why
uncle
you
pointed
out
and
it
was
very
true
then
that
my
fortune
was
not
sufficient
to
enable
lord
ballindine
to
keep
up
his
rank
it
is
different
now
and
i
am
very
very
sorry
that
it
is
so
but
it
is
different
now
and
i
feel
that
i
ought
not
to
reject
lord
ballindine
because
i
am
so
much
richer
than
i
was
when
he
when
he
proposed
to
me
then
it
merely
a
matter
of
feeling
with
you
and
not
of
affection
if
i
understand
you
you
are
afraid
that
you
should
be
thought
to
have
treated
lord
ballindine
badly
it
not
only
that
and
then
she
paused
for
a
few
moments
and
added
i
thought
i
could
have
parted
with
him
when
you
made
me
believe
that
i
ought
to
do
so
but
i
find
i
can
not
you
mean
that
you
love
him
and
the
earl
looked
very
black
at
his
niece
he
intended
to
frighten
her
out
of
her
resolution
but
she
quietly
answered
yes
uncle
i
do
and
you
want
me
to
tell
him
so
after
having
banished
him
from
my
house
fanny
eyes
again
shot
fire
at
the
word
banished
but
she
answered
very
quietly
and
even
with
a
smile
no
uncle
but
i
want
you
to
ask
him
here
again
i
might
tell
him
the
rest
myself
but
fanny
dear
said
the
countess
your
uncle
could
do
it
you
know
he
told
him
to
go
away
before
besides
i
really
do
think
come
he
so
taken
up
with
those
horrid
horses
and
that
mr
blake
who
is
worse
than
any
of
really
fanny
kilcullen
says
that
he
and
mr
blake
are
quite
notorious
i
think
aunt
lord
kilcullen
might
be
satisfied
with
looking
after
himself
if
it
depended
on
him
he
never
had
a
kind
word
to
say
for
lord
ballindine
but
you
know
fanny
continued
the
aunt
he
knows
everybody
and
if
he
says
lord
ballindine
is
that
sort
of
person
why
it
must
be
so
though
i
sure
i
very
sorry
to
hear
it
lord
cashel
saw
that
he
could
not
trust
any
more
to
his
wife
that
last
hit
about
kilcullen
had
been
very
unfortunate
so
he
determined
to
put
an
end
to
all
fanny
yearnings
after
her
lover
with
a
strong
hand
and
said
if
you
mean
fanny
after
what
has
passed
that
i
should
go
to
lord
ballindine
and
give
him
to
understand
that
he
is
again
welcome
to
grey
abbey
i
must
at
once
tell
you
that
it
is
absolutely
absolutely
impossible
if
i
had
no
personal
objection
to
the
young
man
on
any
prudential
score
the
very
fact
of
my
having
already
at
your
request
desired
his
absence
from
my
house
would
be
sufficient
to
render
it
impossible
i
owe
too
much
to
my
own
dignity
and
am
too
anxious
for
your
reputation
to
think
of
doing
such
a
thing
but
when
i
also
remember
that
lord
ballindine
is
a
reckless
dissipated
gambler
i
much
fear
with
no
fixed
principle
i
should
consider
any
step
towards
renewing
the
acquaintance
between
you
a
most
wicked
and
unpardonable
proceeding
when
fanny
heard
her
lover
designated
as
a
reckless
gambler
she
lost
all
remaining
feelings
of
fear
at
her
uncle
anger
and
standing
up
looked
him
full
in
the
face
through
her
tears
it
not
so
my
lord
she
said
when
he
had
finished
he
is
not
what
you
have
said
i
know
him
too
well
to
believe
such
things
of
him
and
i
will
not
submit
to
hear
him
abused
oh
fanny
my
dear
said
the
frightened
countess
do
speak
in
that
way
surely
your
uncle
means
to
act
for
your
own
happiness
and
do
you
know
lord
ballindine
has
those
horrid
horses
if
i
do
mind
his
horses
aunt
no
one
else
need
but
he
no
gambler
and
he
not
dissipated
i
sure
not
half
so
much
so
as
lord
kilcullen
in
that
fanny
you
mistaken
said
the
earl
but
i
do
wish
to
discuss
the
matter
with
you
you
must
however
fully
understand
this
lord
ballindine
can
not
be
received
under
this
roof
if
you
regret
him
you
must
remember
that
his
rejection
was
your
own
act
i
think
you
then
acted
most
prudently
and
i
trust
it
will
not
be
long
before
you
are
of
the
same
opinion
yourself
and
lord
cashel
moved
to
the
door
as
though
he
had
accomplished
his
part
in
the
interview
stop
one
moment
uncle
said
fanny
striving
hard
to
be
calm
and
hardly
succeeding
i
did
not
ask
my
aunt
to
speak
to
you
on
this
subject
till
i
had
turned
it
over
and
over
in
my
mind
and
resolved
that
i
would
not
make
myself
and
another
miserable
for
ever
because
i
had
been
foolish
enough
not
to
know
my
mind
you
best
know
whether
you
can
ask
lord
ballindine
to
grey
abbey
or
not
but
i
am
determined
if
i
can
not
see
him
here
that
i
will
see
him
somewhere
else
and
she
turned
towards
the
door
and
then
thinking
of
her
aunt
she
turned
back
and
kissed
her
and
immediately
left
the
room
the
countess
looked
up
at
her
husband
quite
dumbfounded
and
he
seemed
rather
distressed
himself
however
he
muttered
something
about
her
being
a
simpleton
and
soon
thinking
better
about
it
and
then
betook
himself
to
his
private
retreat
to
hold
sweet
converse
with
his
own
thoughts
having
first
rung
the
bell
for
griffiths
to
pick
up
the
scattered
threads
of
her
mistress
knitting
lord
cashel
certainly
did
not
like
the
look
of
things
there
was
a
determination
in
fanny
eye
as
she
made
her
parting
speech
which
upset
him
rather
and
which
threw
considerable
difficulties
in
the
way
of
lord
kilcullen
wooing
to
be
sure
time
would
do
a
great
deal
but
then
there
was
so
much
time
to
spare
he
had
already
taken
steps
to
borrow
the
thirty
thousand
pounds
and
had
indeed
empowered
his
son
to
receive
it
he
had
also
pledged
himself
for
the
other
fifty
and
then
after
all
that
perverse
fool
of
a
girl
would
insist
on
being
in
love
with
that
scapegrace
lord
ballindine
this
however
might
wear
away
and
he
would
take
very
good
care
that
she
should
hear
of
his
misdoings
it
would
be
very
odd
if
after
all
his
plans
were
to
be
destroyed
and
his
arrangements
disconcerted
by
his
own
ward
and
niece
especially
when
he
designed
so
great
a
match
for
her
he
could
not
however
make
himself
quite
comfortable
though
he
had
great
confidence
in
his
own
diplomatic
resources
xv
handicap
lodge
lord
ballindine
left
grey
abbey
and
rode
homewards
towards
handicap
lodge
in
a
melancholy
and
speculative
mood
his
first
thoughts
were
all
of
harry
wyndham
frank
as
the
accepted
suitor
of
his
sister
had
known
him
well
and
intimately
and
had
liked
him
much
and
the
poor
young
fellow
had
been
much
attached
to
him
he
was
greatly
shocked
to
hear
of
his
death
it
was
not
yet
a
month
since
he
had
seen
him
shining
in
all
the
splendour
of
his
cavalry
regimentals
and
lord
ballindine
was
unfeignedly
grieved
to
think
how
short
a
time
the
lad
had
lived
to
enjoy
them
his
thoughts
then
naturally
turned
to
his
own
position
and
the
declaration
which
lord
cashel
had
made
to
him
respecting
himself
could
it
be
absolutely
true
that
fanny
had
determined
to
give
him
up
altogether
after
all
her
willing
vows
and
assurances
of
unalterable
affection
could
she
be
so
cold
as
to
content
herself
with
sending
him
a
formal
message
by
her
uncle
that
she
did
not
wish
to
see
him
again
frank
argued
with
himself
that
it
was
impossible
he
was
sure
he
knew
her
too
well
but
still
lord
cashel
would
hardly
tell
him
a
downright
lie
and
he
had
distinctly
stated
that
the
rejection
came
from
miss
wyndham
herself
then
he
began
to
feel
indignant
and
spurred
his
horse
and
rode
a
little
faster
and
made
a
few
resolutions
as
to
upholding
his
own
dignity
he
would
run
after
neither
lord
cashel
nor
his
niece
he
would
not
even
ask
her
to
change
her
mind
since
she
had
been
able
to
bring
herself
to
such
a
determination
as
that
expressed
to
him
but
he
would
insist
on
seeing
her
she
could
not
refuse
that
to
him
after
what
had
passed
between
them
and
he
would
then
tell
her
what
he
thought
of
her
and
leave
her
for
ever
but
no
he
would
do
nothing
to
vex
her
as
long
as
she
was
grieving
for
her
brother
poor
harry
she
loved
him
so
dearly
perhaps
after
all
his
sudden
rejection
was
in
some
manner
occasioned
by
this
sad
event
and
would
be
revoked
as
her
sorrow
grew
less
with
time
and
then
for
the
first
time
the
idea
shot
across
his
mind
of
the
wealth
fanny
must
inherit
by
her
brother
death
it
certainly
had
a
considerable
effect
on
him
for
he
breathed
slow
awhile
and
was
some
little
time
before
he
could
entirely
realise
the
conception
that
fanny
was
now
the
undoubted
owner
of
a
large
fortune
that
is
it
thought
he
to
himself
at
last
that
sordid
earl
considers
that
he
can
now
be
sure
of
a
higher
match
for
his
niece
and
fanny
has
allowed
herself
to
be
persuaded
out
of
her
engagement
she
has
allowed
herself
to
be
talked
into
the
belief
that
it
was
her
duty
to
give
up
a
poor
man
like
me
and
then
he
felt
very
angry
again
heavens
said
he
to
himself
is
it
possible
she
should
be
so
servile
and
so
mean
fanny
wyndham
who
cared
so
little
for
the
prosy
admonitions
of
her
uncle
a
few
months
since
can
she
have
altered
her
disposition
so
completely
can
the
possession
of
her
brother
money
have
made
so
vile
a
change
in
her
character
could
she
be
the
same
fanny
who
had
so
entirely
belonged
to
him
who
had
certainly
loved
him
truly
once
perish
her
money
he
had
sought
her
from
affection
alone
he
had
truly
and
fondly
loved
her
he
had
determined
to
cling
to
her
in
spite
of
the
advice
of
his
friends
and
then
he
found
himself
deserted
and
betrayed
by
her
because
circumstances
had
given
her
the
probable
power
of
making
a
better
match
such
were
lord
ballindine
thoughts
and
he
flattered
himself
with
the
reflection
that
he
was
a
most
cruelly
used
affectionate
and
disinterested
lover
he
did
not
at
the
moment
remember
that
it
was
fanny
twenty
thousand
pounds
which
had
first
attracted
his
notice
and
that
he
had
for
a
considerable
time
wavered
before
he
made
up
his
mind
to
part
with
himself
at
so
low
a
price
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
he
should
remember
that
just
at
present
and
he
rode
on
considerably
out
of
humour
with
all
the
world
except
himself
as
he
got
near
to
handicap
lodge
however
the
genius
of
the
of
that
classic
spot
came
upon
him
and
he
began
to
bethink
himself
that
it
would
be
somewhat
foolish
of
him
to
give
up
the
game
just
at
present
he
reflected
that
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
would
work
a
wondrous
change
and
improvement
at
kelly
court
and
that
if
he
was
before
prepared
to
marry
fanny
wyndham
in
opposition
to
the
wishes
of
her
guardian
he
should
now
be
doubly
determined
to
do
so
even
though
all
grey
abbey
had
resolved
to
the
contrary
the
last
idea
in
his
mind
as
he
got
off
his
horse
at
his
friend
door
was
as
to
what
dot
blake
would
think
and
say
of
the
tidings
he
brought
home
with
him
it
was
dark
when
he
reached
handicap
lodge
and
having
first
asked
whether
mr
blake
was
in
and
heard
that
he
was
dressing
for
dinner
he
went
to
perform
the
same
operation
himself
when
he
came
down
full
of
his
budget
and
quite
ready
as
usual
to
apply
to
dot
for
advice
he
was
surprised
and
annoyed
to
find
two
other
gentlemen
in
the
room
together
with
blake
what
a
bore
to
have
to
make
one
of
a
of
four
and
the
long
protracted
rubber
of
shorts
which
would
follow
it
when
his
mind
was
so
full
of
other
concerns
however
it
was
not
to
be
avoided
the
guests
were
the
fat
mat
tierney
and
a
little
connaught
member
of
parliament
named
morris
who
wore
a
wig
played
a
very
good
rubber
of
whist
and
knew
a
good
deal
about
selling
hunters
he
was
not
very
bright
but
he
told
one
or
two
good
stories
of
his
own
adventures
in
the
world
which
he
repeated
oftener
than
was
approved
of
by
his
intimate
friends
and
he
drank
his
wine
plentifully
and
discreetly
for
if
he
did
get
a
game
of
cards
after
consuming
a
certain
quantum
he
invariably
went
to
sleep
there
was
something
in
the
manner
in
which
the
three
greeted
him
on
entering
the
room
which
showed
him
that
they
had
been
speaking
of
him
and
his
affairs
dot
was
the
first
to
address
him
well
frank
i
hope
i
am
to
wish
you
joy
i
hope
you
made
a
good
morning
work
of
it
frank
looked
rather
distressed
before
he
could
answer
however
mat
tierney
said
well
ballindine
upon
my
soul
i
congratulate
you
sincerely
though
of
course
you
seen
nothing
at
grey
abbey
but
tears
and
cambric
handkerchiefs
i
very
glad
now
that
what
kilcullen
told
me
true
he
left
dublin
for
london
yesterday
and
i
suppose
he
wo
hear
of
his
cousin
death
before
he
gets
there
upon
my
honour
lord
ballindine
said
the
member
you
are
a
lucky
fellow
i
believe
old
wyndham
was
a
regular
golden
nabob
and
i
suppose
now
you
touch
the
whole
of
his
gatherings
dot
and
his
guests
had
heard
of
harry
wyndham
death
and
accession
of
fortune
but
they
had
not
heard
that
she
had
rejected
her
lover
and
that
he
had
been
all
but
turned
out
of
her
guardian
house
nor
did
he
mean
to
tell
them
but
he
did
not
find
himself
pleasantly
situated
in
having
to
hear
their
congratulations
and
listen
to
their
jokes
while
he
himself
felt
that
the
rumour
which
he
had
so
emphatically
denied
to
mat
tierney
only
two
days
since
had
turned
out
to
be
true
not
one
of
the
party
made
the
slightest
reference
to
the
poor
brother
from
whom
fanny
new
fortune
had
come
except
as
the
lucky
means
of
conveying
it
to
her
there
was
no
regret
even
pretended
for
his
early
death
no
sympathy
expressed
with
fanny
sorrow
and
there
was
moreover
an
evident
conviction
in
the
minds
of
all
the
three
that
frank
of
course
looked
on
the
accident
as
a
piece
of
unalloyed
good
fortune
a
splendid
windfall
in
his
way
unattended
with
any
disagreeable
concomitants
this
grated
against
his
feelings
and
made
him
conscious
that
he
was
not
yet
heartless
enough
to
be
quite
fit
for
the
society
in
which
he
found
himself
the
party
soon
went
into
the
and
frank
at
first
got
a
little
ease
for
fanny
wyndham
seemed
to
be
forgotten
in
the
willing
devotion
which
was
paid
to
blake
soup
the
interest
of
the
fish
also
seemed
to
be
absorbing
and
though
conversation
became
more
general
towards
the
latter
courses
still
it
was
on
general
subjects
as
long
as
the
servants
were
in
the
room
but
much
to
his
annoyance
his
mistress
again
came
on
the
tapis
together
with
the
claret
footnote
a
tapis
was
a
small
cloth
or
tapestry
sometimes
used
to
cover
a
table
hence
the
expression
on
the
tapis
meant
on
the
table
or
under
consideration
you
and
kilcullen
do
hit
it
off
together
eh
ballindine
said
mat
we
never
quarrelled
answered
frank
we
never
however
were
very
intimate
i
wonder
at
that
for
you
both
fond
of
the
turf
there
a
large
string
of
his
at
murphy
now
is
there
dot
too
many
i
believe
said
blake
if
you
a
mind
to
be
a
purchaser
you
find
him
a
very
pleasant
fellow
especially
if
you
do
object
to
his
own
prices
faith
i
not
trouble
him
said
mat
i
two
of
them
already
and
a
couple
on
the
turf
and
a
couple
for
the
saddle
are
quite
enough
to
suit
me
but
what
the
deuce
made
him
say
so
publicly
that
your
match
was
off
ballindine
he
could
have
heard
of
wyndham
death
at
the
time
or
i
should
think
he
was
after
the
money
himself
i
can
not
tell
he
certainly
had
not
my
authority
said
frank
nor
the
lady
either
i
hope
you
had
better
ask
herself
tierney
and
if
she
rejects
me
maybe
she
take
you
there
a
speculation
for
you
said
blake
you
do
think
yourself
too
old
yet
i
hope
to
make
your
fortune
by
marriage
and
if
you
do
i
sure
miss
wyndham
ca
i
tell
you
what
dot
i
admire
miss
wyndham
much
and
i
admire
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
more
i
do
know
anything
i
admire
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
except
two
but
upon
my
word
i
take
the
money
and
the
lady
together
well
that
kind
of
him
is
it
frank
so
you
a
chance
left
yet
ah
but
you
forget
morris
said
tierney
and
there
yourself
too
if
ballindine
is
not
to
be
the
lucky
man
i
do
see
why
either
of
you
should
despair
oh
as
for
me
i
the
devil
i
a
tail
only
i
do
wear
it
except
on
state
occasions
and
i
horns
and
hoofs
only
people
see
them
but
i
do
see
why
morris
should
not
succeed
he
the
only
one
of
the
four
that
does
own
a
racehorse
and
that
much
in
his
favour
what
do
you
say
morris
i
have
no
objection
said
the
member
except
that
i
would
like
to
stand
in
lord
ballindine
way
oh
he
the
soul
of
you
would
take
it
ill
of
him
would
you
frank
not
the
least
said
frank
sulkily
for
he
did
like
the
conversation
and
he
did
know
how
to
put
a
stop
to
it
perhaps
you
would
mind
giving
him
a
line
of
introduction
to
lord
cashel
said
mat
but
morris
said
blake
i
afraid
your
politics
would
go
against
you
a
repealer
would
never
go
down
at
grey
abbey
morris
never
let
his
politics
harm
him
said
tierney
repeal
a
very
good
thing
the
other
side
of
the
shannon
or
one
might
carry
it
as
far
as
conciliation
hall
if
one
was
hard
pressed
and
near
an
election
were
you
ever
in
conciliation
hall
yet
morris
no
mat
but
i
going
next
thursday
will
you
go
with
me
faith
i
will
not
but
i
think
you
should
go
you
ought
to
do
something
for
your
country
for
you
a
patriot
i
never
was
a
public
man
well
when
i
can
do
any
good
for
my
country
i
go
there
talking
of
that
i
saw
in
town
yesterday
and
i
never
saw
him
looking
so
well
the
verdict
has
disturbed
him
much
i
wonder
what
steps
the
government
will
take
now
they
must
be
fairly
bothered
i
do
think
they
dare
imprison
him
not
dare
said
blake
why
not
when
they
had
courage
to
indict
him
you
need
not
fear
but
what
they
dare
to
go
on
with
a
strong
hand
now
they
have
a
verdict
i
tell
you
what
dot
if
they
imprison
the
whole
set
said
mat
and
keep
them
in
prison
for
twelve
months
every
catholic
in
ireland
will
be
a
repealer
by
the
end
of
that
time
and
why
should
they
all
be
repealers
said
morris
it
seems
to
me
that
it
just
as
natural
for
us
to
be
repealers
as
it
is
for
you
to
be
the
contrary
i
wo
say
they
do
dare
to
put
them
in
prison
continued
mat
but
i
will
say
they
be
great
fools
to
do
it
the
government
have
so
good
an
excuse
for
not
doing
so
they
have
such
an
easy
path
out
of
the
hobble
there
was
just
enough
difference
of
opinion
among
the
judges
just
enough
irregularity
in
the
trial
such
as
the
omissions
of
the
names
from
the
long
panel
to
enable
them
to
pardon
the
whole
set
with
a
good
grace
if
they
did
said
blake
the
whole
high
tory
party
in
this
country
peers
and
parsons
would
be
furious
they
lose
one
set
of
supporters
and
would
gain
another
my
opinion
is
they
lock
the
whole
party
up
in
the
stone
jug
for
some
time
at
least
why
said
tierney
their
own
party
could
not
quarrel
with
them
for
not
taking
an
advantage
of
a
verdict
as
to
the
legality
of
which
there
is
so
much
difference
of
opinion
even
among
the
judges
i
do
know
much
about
these
things
myself
but
as
far
as
i
can
understand
they
would
have
all
been
found
guilty
of
high
treason
a
few
years
back
and
probably
have
been
hung
or
beheaded
and
if
they
could
do
that
now
the
country
would
be
all
the
quieter
but
they
ca
the
people
will
have
their
own
way
and
if
they
want
the
people
to
go
easy
they
put
into
prison
rob
them
all
of
the
glories
of
martyrdom
and
you
find
you
cut
their
combs
and
stop
their
crowing
it
not
so
easy
to
do
that
now
mat
said
morris
you
find
that
the
country
will
stick
to
whether
he
in
prison
or
out
of
it
but
peel
will
never
dare
to
put
him
there
they
talk
of
the
penitentiary
but
i
tell
you
what
if
they
put
him
there
the
people
of
dublin
wo
leave
one
stone
upon
another
they
have
it
all
down
in
a
night
you
forget
morris
how
near
richmond
barracks
are
to
the
penitentiary
no
i
do
not
that
i
think
there
be
any
row
of
the
kind
for
i
bet
a
hundred
guineas
they
never
put
in
prison
at
all
done
said
dot
and
his
little
book
was
out
put
that
down
morris
and
i
initial
it
a
hundred
guineas
even
that
is
not
in
prison
within
twelve
months
of
this
time
very
well
that
is
that
he
not
put
there
and
kept
there
for
six
months
in
consequence
of
the
verdict
just
given
at
the
state
trials
no
my
boy
that
not
it
i
said
nothing
about
being
kept
there
six
months
they
going
to
try
for
a
writ
of
error
or
what
the
devil
they
call
it
before
the
peers
but
i
bet
you
a
cool
hundred
he
is
put
in
prison
before
twelve
months
are
over
in
consequence
of
the
verdict
if
he
locked
up
there
for
one
night
i
win
will
you
take
that
well
i
will
said
morris
and
they
both
went
to
work
at
their
little
books
i
was
in
london
said
mat
during
the
greater
portion
of
the
trial
and
it
astonishing
what
unanimity
of
opinion
there
was
at
the
club
that
the
whole
set
would
be
acquitted
i
heard
howard
make
bet
at
the
reform
club
that
the
only
man
put
in
prison
would
be
the
he
ought
to
have
included
the
chief
justice
said
morris
by
the
bye
mat
is
that
howard
the
brother
of
the
honourable
and
riverind
augustus
upon
my
soul
i
do
know
whose
brother
he
is
who
is
the
riverind
augustus
morris
wants
to
tell
a
story
mat
said
blake
spoil
him
now
indeed
i
do
said
the
member
i
never
told
it
to
any
one
till
i
mentioned
it
to
you
the
other
day
it
only
happened
the
other
day
but
it
worth
telling
out
with
it
morris
said
mat
it
is
very
long
is
it
because
if
it
is
we
get
dot
to
give
us
a
little
whiskey
and
hot
water
first
i
sick
of
the
claret
just
as
you
like
mat
and
blake
rang
the
bell
and
the
hot
water
was
brought
you
know
savarius
said
morris
anxious
to
tell
his
story
eh
tierney
what
savy
with
the
whiskers
said
tierney
to
be
sure
i
do
who
does
know
savy
you
know
him
do
you
lord
ballindine
morris
was
determined
everybody
should
listen
to
him
oh
yes
i
know
him
he
comes
from
county
mayo
his
property
close
to
mine
that
is
the
patch
of
rocks
and
cabins
which
he
has
managed
to
mortgage
three
times
over
and
each
time
for
more
than
its
value
which
he
still
calls
the
estate
well
some
time
ago
that
is
since
london
began
to
fill
was
seen
walking
down
regent
street
with
a
parson
how
the
deuce
he
ever
got
hold
of
the
parson
or
the
parson
of
him
was
never
explained
but
phil
mahon
saw
him
and
asked
him
who
his
friend
in
the
white
choker
was
it
my
friend
in
black
you
mane
says
savy
my
frind
was
the
honourable
and
the
riverind
augustus
howard
the
dane
the
dane
said
mahon
the
duce
did
any
of
the
howards
become
danes
bother
said
savy
not
of
thim
danes
he
is
not
the
danes
of
shwaden
i
mane
at
all
man
but
a
rural
dane
of
the
church
of
england
mat
tierney
laughed
heartily
at
this
and
even
frank
forgot
that
his
dignity
had
been
hurt
and
that
he
meant
to
be
sulky
and
he
laughed
also
the
little
member
was
delighted
with
his
success
and
felt
himself
encouraged
to
persevere
ah
savy
a
queer
fellow
if
you
knew
him
he
continued
turning
to
lord
ballindine
and
upon
my
soul
he
no
fool
oh
if
you
knew
him
as
well
did
you
hear
ballindine
say
he
was
his
next
door
neighbour
in
mayo
said
blake
or
rather
next
barrack
neighbour
for
they
dispense
with
doors
in
mayo
eh
frank
and
their
houses
are
all
cabins
or
barracks
why
we
certainly
do
pretend
to
all
the
apuleian
luxuries
of
handicap
lodge
but
we
are
ignorant
enough
to
think
ourselves
comfortable
and
swinish
enough
to
enjoy
our
pitiable
state
i
beg
ten
thousand
pardons
my
dear
fellow
i
did
mean
to
offend
your
nationality
castlebar
we
must
allow
is
a
fine
provincial
city
though
killala
the
mayo
city
i
believe
and
claremorris
which
is
your
own
town
i
think
is
as
all
admit
a
gem
of
paradise
only
it
a
pity
so
many
of
the
houses
have
been
unroofed
lately
it
adds
perhaps
to
the
picturesque
effect
but
it
must
i
should
think
take
away
from
the
comfort
not
a
house
in
claremorris
belongs
to
me
said
lord
ballindine
again
rather
sulky
or
ever
did
to
any
of
my
family
i
would
as
soon
own
claremorris
though
as
i
would
castleblakeney
your
own
town
is
quite
as
a
place
that
quite
true
but
i
have
some
hopes
that
castleblakeney
will
be
blotted
out
of
the
face
of
creation
before
i
come
into
possession
but
i
was
saying
about
savy
again
interposed
morris
did
you
ever
hear
what
he
did
but
blake
would
not
allow
his
guest
the
privilege
of
another
story
if
you
encourage
morris
said
he
we
shall
never
get
our
whist
and
with
that
he
rose
from
the
table
and
walked
away
into
the
next
room
they
played
high
morris
always
played
high
if
he
could
for
he
made
money
by
whist
tierney
was
not
a
gambler
by
profession
but
the
men
he
lived
among
all
played
and
he
therefore
got
into
the
way
of
it
and
played
the
game
well
for
he
was
obliged
to
do
so
in
his
own
defence
blake
was
an
adept
at
every
thing
of
the
kind
and
though
the
was
not
the
place
where
his
light
shone
brightest
still
he
was
quite
at
home
at
it
as
might
be
supposed
lord
ballindine
did
not
fare
well
among
the
three
he
played
with
each
of
them
one
after
the
other
and
lost
with
them
all
blake
to
do
him
justice
did
not
wish
to
see
his
money
go
into
the
little
member
pocket
and
once
or
twice
proposed
giving
up
but
frank
did
not
second
the
proposal
and
morris
was
inveterate
the
consequence
was
that
before
the
table
was
broken
up
lord
ballindine
had
lost
a
sum
of
money
which
he
could
very
ill
spare
and
went
to
bed
in
a
very
unenviable
state
of
mind
in
spite
of
the
brilliant
prospects
on
which
his
friends
congratulated
him
xvi
brien
boru
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
when
frank
was
alone
with
blake
he
explained
to
him
how
matters
really
stood
at
grey
abbey
he
told
him
how
impossible
he
had
found
it
to
insist
on
seeing
miss
wyndham
so
soon
after
her
brother
death
and
how
disgustingly
disagreeable
stiff
and
repulsive
the
earl
had
been
and
by
degrees
they
got
to
talk
of
other
things
and
among
them
frank
present
pecuniary
miseries
there
can
be
no
doubt
i
suppose
said
dot
when
frank
had
consoled
himself
by
anathematising
the
earl
for
ten
minutes
as
to
the
fact
of
miss
wyndham
inheriting
her
brother
fortune
faith
i
do
know
i
never
thought
about
her
fortune
if
believe
me
i
never
even
remembered
that
her
brother
death
would
in
any
way
affect
her
in
the
way
of
money
until
after
i
left
grey
abbey
oh
i
can
believe
you
capable
of
anything
in
the
way
of
imprudence
ah
but
dot
to
think
of
that
pompous
fool
who
sits
and
caws
in
that
dingy
of
his
with
as
much
wise
as
an
antiquated
raven
to
think
of
him
insinuating
that
i
had
come
there
looking
for
harry
wyndham
money
when
as
you
know
i
was
as
ignorant
of
the
poor
fellow
death
as
lord
cashel
was
himself
a
week
ago
insolent
blackguard
i
would
never
willingly
speak
another
word
to
him
or
put
my
foot
inside
that
infernal
door
of
his
if
it
were
to
get
ten
times
all
harry
wyndham
fortune
then
if
i
understand
you
you
now
mean
to
relinquish
your
claims
to
miss
wyndham
hand
no
i
do
believe
she
ever
sent
the
message
her
uncle
gave
me
i
do
see
why
i
to
give
her
up
just
because
she
got
this
money
nor
i
frank
to
tell
the
truth
especially
considering
how
badly
you
want
it
yourself
but
i
do
think
quarrelling
with
the
uncle
is
the
surest
way
to
get
the
niece
but
man
he
quarrelled
with
me
it
takes
two
people
to
quarrel
if
he
quarrelled
with
you
do
you
be
the
less
willing
to
come
to
loggerheads
with
him
would
it
be
the
best
plan
dot
to
carry
her
off
she
would
go
my
boy
rope
ladders
and
are
out
of
fashion
but
if
she
really
fond
of
me
and
upon
my
honour
i
do
believe
i
flattering
myself
in
thinking
that
she
is
why
the
deuce
she
marry
me
lord
cashel
she
must
be
her
own
mistress
in
a
week
or
two
by
heavens
i
can
not
stomach
that
fellow
arrogant
assumption
of
superiority
footnote
malgré
french
in
spite
of
notwithstanding
it
will
be
much
more
convenient
for
her
to
marry
you
lord
cashel
whom
you
may
pitch
to
the
devil
in
any
way
you
like
best
as
soon
as
you
have
fanny
wyndham
at
kelly
court
but
till
that
happy
time
take
my
advice
and
submit
to
the
cawing
rooks
and
ravens
are
respectable
birds
just
because
they
do
look
so
wise
it
a
great
thing
to
look
wise
the
doing
so
does
an
acknowledged
fool
like
lord
cashel
very
great
credit

bon
gré
french

what
ought
i
to
do
i
ca
go
to
the
man
house
when
he
told
me
expressly
not
to
do
so
oh
yes
you
can
not
immediately
but
by
and
by
in
a
month
or
six
weeks
i
tell
you
what
i
should
do
in
your
place
and
remember
frank
i
quite
in
earnest
now
for
it
a
very
different
thing
playing
a
game
for
twenty
thousand
pounds
which
to
you
joined
to
a
wife
would
have
been
a
positive
irreparable
loss
and
starting
for
five
or
six
times
that
sum
which
would
give
you
an
income
on
which
you
might
manage
to
live
well
thou
sapient
counsellor
but
i
tell
you
beforehand
the
chances
are
ten
to
one
i
follow
your
plan
do
as
you
like
about
that
you
at
any
rate
have
me
to
blame
i
would
in
the
first
place
assure
myself
that
fanny
inherited
her
brother
money
there
no
doubt
about
that
lord
cashel
said
as
much
make
sure
of
it
however
a
lawyer
do
that
for
you
with
very
little
trouble
then
take
your
name
off
the
turf
at
once
it
worth
your
while
to
do
it
now
you
may
either
do
it
by
a
sale
of
the
horses
or
by
running
them
in
some
other
person
name
then
watch
your
opportunity
call
at
grey
abbey
when
the
earl
is
not
at
home
and
manage
to
see
some
of
the
ladies
if
you
ca
do
that
if
you
effect
an
write
to
miss
wyndham
do
be
too
lachrymose
or
supplicatory
in
your
style
but
ask
her
to
give
you
a
plain
answer
personally
or
in
her
own
handwriting
and
if
she
declines
the
honour
if
as
you
say
and
as
i
believe
she
loves
or
has
loved
you
i
think
she
do
so
she
submit
to
a
little
parleying
and
then
she
capitulate
but
it
will
be
much
better
that
you
should
see
her
if
possible
without
writing
at
all
i
do
like
the
idea
of
calling
at
grey
abbey
i
wonder
whether
they
go
to
london
this
season
if
they
do
you
can
go
after
them
the
truth
is
simply
this
ballindine
miss
wyndham
will
follow
her
own
fancy
in
the
matter
in
spite
of
her
guardian
but
if
you
make
no
further
advances
to
her
of
course
she
can
make
none
to
you
but
i
think
the
game
is
in
your
own
hand
you
have
the
head
to
play
it
or
i
should
consider
the
stakes
as
good
as
won
but
then
about
these
horses
dot
i
wish
i
could
sell
them
out
and
out
at
once
you
find
it
very
difficult
to
get
anything
like
the
value
for
a
horse
that
well
up
for
the
derby
you
see
a
purchaser
must
make
up
his
mind
to
so
much
outlay
there
the
and
expense
of
english
training
with
so
remote
a
chance
of
any
speedy
return
but
you
said
you
advise
me
to
sell
them
that
if
you
can
get
a
purchaser
or
else
run
them
in
another
name
you
may
run
them
in
my
name
if
you
like
it
but
scott
must
understand
that
i
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
expense
would
you
not
buy
them
yourself
blake
no
i
would
not
why
not
if
i
gave
you
anything
like
the
value
for
them
the
bargain
would
not
suit
me
and
if
i
got
them
for
what
they
be
worth
to
me
you
think
and
other
people
would
say
that
i
robbed
you
then
followed
a
lengthened
and
most
intricate
discourse
on
the
affairs
of
the
stable
frank
much
wanted
his
friend
to
take
his
stud
entirely
off
his
hands
but
this
dot
resolutely
refused
to
do
in
the
course
of
conversation
frank
owned
that
the
present
state
of
his
funds
rendered
it
almost
impracticable
for
him
to
incur
the
expense
of
sending
his
favourite
brien
boru
to
win
laurels
in
england
he
had
lost
nearly
three
hundred
pounds
the
previous
evening
which
his
account
at
his
banker
did
not
enable
him
to
pay
his
dublin
agent
had
declined
advancing
him
more
money
at
present
and
his
tradesmen
were
very
importunate
in
fact
he
was
in
a
scrape
and
dot
must
advise
him
how
to
extricate
himself
from
it
i
tell
you
the
truth
ballindine
said
he
as
far
as
concerned
myself
i
never
will
lend
money
except
where
i
see
as
a
matter
of
business
that
it
is
a
good
speculation
to
do
so
i
do
it
for
my
father
who
asked
you
said
frank
turning
very
red
and
looking
very
angry
you
did
not
certainly
but
i
thought
you
might
and
you
would
have
been
annoyed
when
i
refused
you
now
you
have
the
power
of
being
indignant
instead
however
having
said
so
much
i
tell
you
what
i
think
you
should
do
and
what
i
will
do
to
relieve
you
as
far
as
the
horses
are
concerned
do
you
go
down
to
kelly
court
and
remain
there
quiet
for
a
time
you
be
able
to
borrow
what
money
you
absolutely
want
down
there
if
the
dublin
fellows
actually
refuse
but
do
with
as
little
as
you
can
the
horses
shall
run
in
my
name
for
twelve
months
if
they
win
i
will
divide
with
you
at
the
end
of
the
year
the
amount
won
after
deducting
their
expenses
if
they
lose
i
will
charge
you
with
half
the
amount
lost
including
the
expenses
should
you
not
feel
inclined
at
the
end
of
the
year
to
repay
me
this
sum
i
will
then
keep
the
horses
instead
or
sell
them
at
dycer
if
you
like
it
better
and
hand
you
the
balance
if
there
be
any
what
do
you
say
to
this
you
will
be
released
from
all
trouble
annoyance
and
expense
and
the
cattle
will
i
trust
be
in
good
hands
that
is
to
say
that
for
one
year
you
are
to
possess
one
half
of
whatever
value
the
horses
may
be
exactly
we
shall
be
partners
for
one
year
to
make
that
fair
said
frank
you
ought
to
put
into
the
concern
three
horses
as
good
and
as
valuable
as
my
three
yes
and
you
ought
to
bring
into
the
concern
half
the
capital
to
be
expended
in
their
training
and
knowledge
experience
and
skill
in
making
use
of
them
equal
to
mine
no
frank
you
mistaken
if
you
think
that
i
can
afford
to
give
up
my
time
merely
for
the
purpose
of
making
an
arrangement
to
save
you
from
trouble
upon
my
word
dot
answered
the
other
you
about
the
coolest
hand
i
ever
met
did
i
ask
you
for
your
precious
time
or
anything
else
you
always
afraid
that
you
going
to
be
done
now
you
might
make
a
distinction
between
me
and
some
of
your
other
friends
and
remember
that
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
doing
anybody
why
i
own
i
do
think
it
very
likely
that
i
or
indeed
anyone
else
should
suffer
much
from
you
in
that
way
for
your
sin
is
not
too
much
sharpness
then
why
do
you
talk
about
what
you
can
afford
to
do
because
it
necessary
i
made
a
proposal
which
you
thought
an
unfair
one
you
may
believe
me
but
it
is
a
most
positive
fact
that
my
only
object
in
making
that
proposal
was
to
benefit
you
you
will
find
it
difficult
to
get
rid
of
your
horses
on
any
terms
and
yet
with
the
very
great
stake
before
you
in
miss
wyndham
fortune
it
would
be
foolish
in
you
to
think
of
keeping
them
and
on
this
account
i
thought
in
what
manner
i
could
take
them
from
you
if
they
belong
to
my
stables
i
shall
consider
myself
bound
to
run
them
to
the
best
advantage
and
well
well
for
heaven
sake
do
speechify
about
it
stop
a
moment
frank
and
listen
for
i
must
make
you
understand
i
must
make
you
see
that
i
am
not
taking
advantage
of
your
position
and
trying
to
rob
my
own
friend
in
my
own
house
i
do
care
what
most
people
say
of
me
for
in
my
career
i
must
expect
people
to
lie
of
me
i
must
also
take
care
of
myself
but
i
do
wish
you
to
know
that
though
i
could
not
disarrange
my
schemes
for
you
i
would
not
take
you
in
why
dot
how
can
you
go
on
so
i
only
thought
i
was
taking
a
leaf
out
of
your
book
by
being
careful
to
make
the
best
bargain
i
could
well
as
i
was
saying
i
would
run
the
horses
to
the
best
advantage
especially
brien
for
the
derby
by
doing
so
my
whole
book
would
be
upset
i
should
have
to
bet
all
round
again
and
very
likely
not
be
able
to
get
the
bets
i
want
i
could
not
do
this
without
a
very
strong
interest
in
the
horse
besides
you
remember
that
i
should
have
to
go
over
with
him
to
england
myself
and
that
i
should
be
obliged
to
be
in
england
a
great
deal
at
a
time
when
my
own
business
would
require
me
here
my
dear
fellow
said
frank
you
going
on
as
though
it
were
necessary
to
defend
yourself
i
never
accused
you
of
anything
never
mind
whether
you
did
or
no
you
understand
me
now
if
it
will
suit
you
you
can
take
my
offer
but
i
should
be
glad
to
know
at
once
while
this
conversation
was
going
on
the
two
young
men
had
left
the
house
and
sauntered
out
into
blake
here
were
his
stables
where
he
kept
such
horses
as
were
not
actually
in
the
hands
and
a
large
assortment
of
aged
hunters
celebrated
brood
mares
thoroughbred
fillies
colts
and
promising
foals
they
were
immediately
joined
by
blake
stud
groom
who
came
on
business
intent
to
request
a
few
words
with
his
master
which
meant
that
lord
ballindine
was
to
retreat
as
it
was
full
time
for
his
friend
to
proceed
to
his
regular
day
work
blake
groom
was
a
very
different
person
in
appearance
from
the
sort
of
servant
in
the
possession
of
which
the
fashionable
owner
of
two
or
three
horses
usually
rejoices
he
had
no
diminutive
top
boots
no
loose
brown
breeches
buttoned
low
beneath
the
knee
no
elongated
waistcoat
with
capacious
pockets
no
dandy
coat
with
remarkably
short
tail
he
was
a
very
ugly
man
of
about
fifty
named
john
bottom
dressed
somewhat
like
a
seedy
gentleman
but
he
understood
his
business
well
and
did
it
and
was
sufficiently
wise
to
know
that
he
served
his
own
pocket
best
in
the
long
run
by
being
true
to
his
master
and
by
resisting
the
numerous
tempting
offers
which
were
made
to
him
by
denizens
of
the
turf
to
play
foul
with
his
master
horses
he
was
therefore
a
treasure
to
blake
and
he
knew
it
and
valued
himself
accordingly
well
john
said
his
master
i
suppose
i
must
desert
lord
ballindine
again
and
obey
your
summons
your
few
words
will
last
nearly
till
dinner
i
suppose
why
there
is
a
few
things
to
be
sure
be
the
better
for
being
talked
over
a
bit
as
his
lordship
knows
well
enough
i
wish
we
as
crack
a
nag
in
our
stables
as
his
lordship
maybe
we
may
some
day
one
down
and
another
come
on
you
know
as
the
said
at
any
rate
your
horses
do
want
bottom
said
frank
he
he
he
laughed
john
or
rather
tried
to
do
so
he
had
laughed
at
that
joke
a
thousand
times
and
in
the
best
of
humours
he
was
a
merry
man
well
frank
said
blake
the
cock
has
crowed
i
must
away
i
suppose
you
ride
down
to
igoe
and
see
brien
but
think
of
what
i
said
and
he
added
whispering
remember
that
i
will
do
the
best
i
can
for
the
animals
if
you
put
them
into
my
stables
they
shall
be
made
second
to
nothing
and
shall
only
and
always
run
to
win
so
blake
and
john
bottom
walked
off
to
the
box
stables
and
home
paddocks
frank
ordered
his
horse
and
complied
with
his
friend
suggestion
by
riding
down
to
igoe
he
was
not
in
happy
spirits
as
he
went
he
felt
afraid
that
his
hopes
with
regard
to
fanny
would
be
blighted
and
that
if
he
persevered
in
his
suit
he
would
only
be
harassed
annoyed
and
disappointed
he
did
not
see
what
steps
he
could
take
or
how
he
could
manage
to
see
her
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
go
to
grey
abbey
after
having
been
as
he
felt
turned
out
by
lord
cashel
other
things
troubled
him
also
what
should
he
now
do
with
himself
it
was
true
that
he
could
go
down
to
his
own
house
but
everyone
at
court
expected
him
to
bring
with
him
a
bride
and
a
fortune
and
instead
of
that
he
would
have
to
own
that
he
had
been
jilted
and
would
be
reduced
to
the
disagreeable
necessity
of
borrowing
money
from
his
own
tenants
and
then
that
awful
subject
money
took
possession
of
him
what
the
deuce
was
he
to
do
what
a
fool
he
had
been
to
be
seduced
on
to
the
turf
by
such
a
man
as
blake
and
then
he
expressed
a
wish
to
himself
that
blake
had
been
a
long
way
off
before
he
ever
saw
him
there
he
was
steward
of
the
curragh
the
owner
of
the
best
horse
in
ireland
and
absolutely
without
money
to
enable
him
to
carry
on
the
game
till
he
could
properly
retreat
from
it
then
he
was
a
little
unfair
upon
his
friend
he
accused
him
of
knowing
his
position
and
wishing
to
take
advantage
of
it
and
by
the
time
he
had
got
to
igoe
his
mind
was
certainly
not
in
a
very
charitable
mood
towards
poor
dot
he
had
nevertheless
determined
to
accept
his
offer
and
to
take
a
last
look
at
the
three
milesians
the
people
about
the
stables
always
made
a
great
fuss
with
lord
ballindine
partly
because
he
was
one
of
the
stewards
and
partly
because
he
was
going
to
run
a
crack
horse
for
the
derby
in
england
and
though
generally
speaking
he
did
not
care
much
for
personal
complimentary
respect
he
usually
got
chattered
and
flattered
into
good
humour
at
igoe
well
my
lord
said
a
sort
of
foreman
or
partner
or
managing
man
who
usually
presided
over
the
yard
i
think
we
be
apt
to
get
justice
to
ireland
on
the
downs
this
year
that
is
they
give
us
nothing
but
what
we
takes
from
by
hard
fighting
or
running
as
the
case
may
be
how
brien
looking
this
morning
grady
as
fresh
as
a
primrose
my
lord
and
as
clear
as
crystal
he
ready
this
moment
to
run
through
any
set
of
three
years
old
as
could
be
put
on
the
curragh
anyway
i
afraid
you
putting
him
on
too
forward
too
forrard
is
it
my
lord
not
a
bit
he
a
hoss
as
naturally
pick
up
flesh
though
he
feeds
free
too
he
this
moment
all
wind
and
bottom
though
as
one
may
say
he
got
no
training
he
niver
been
sthretched
yet
faith
it
thrue
i
telling
you
my
lord
i
know
scott
does
like
getting
horses
early
in
the
season
that
are
too
fine
too
much
drawn
up
he
thinks
they
lose
power
by
it
and
so
they
do
it
the
distance
that
kills
them
at
the
derby
it
so
hard
to
get
a
young
horse
to
stay
the
distance
that
thrue
shure
enough
my
lord
and
there
is
a
gentleman
this
side
the
wather
anyway
undherstands
thim
things
betther
than
your
lordship
well
grady
let
have
a
look
at
the
young
chieftain
he
all
right
about
the
lungs
anyway
and
feet
too
my
lord
niver
saw
a
set
of
claner
feet
with
plates
on
and
legs
too
if
you
were
to
canter
him
down
the
road
i
do
think
he
feel
it
not
that
i
like
to
thry
though
why
he
not
yet
had
much
to
try
them
faix
he
has
my
lord
did
he
win
the
autumn
produce
stakes
the
only
thing
he
ever
ran
for
ah
but
i
tell
you
as
your
lordship
knows
very
well
no
one
betther
that
it
a
ticklish
thing
to
bring
a
two
year
old
to
the
post
in
anything
like
condition
with
any
running
in
him
at
all
and
not
hurt
his
legs
but
i
think
he
all
right
eh
grady
right
your
lordship
knows
he
right
i
wish
he
may
be
made
righter
at
john
scott
that
all
but
that
unpossible
of
course
grady
you
think
he
might
be
trained
here
as
well
as
at
the
other
side
of
the
water
no
i
do
my
lord
quite
different
i
none
of
thim
ideas
at
all
and
never
had
thank
god
i
knows
what
we
can
do
and
i
knows
what
they
can
do
breed
a
hoss
in
ireland
train
him
in
the
north
of
england
and
run
him
in
the
south
and
he
do
your
work
for
you
and
win
your
money
steady
and
shure
and
why
not
run
in
the
north
too
they
too
my
lord
they
like
to
pick
up
the
crumbs
themselves
small
blame
to
thim
in
that
matther
no
a
bright
irish
nag
with
lots
of
heart
like
brien
boru
is
the
hoss
to
stand
on
for
the
derby
where
all
run
fair
and
fair
alike
the
best
wins
but
i
wo
say
but
he
be
the
betther
for
a
little
polishing
at
johnny
scott
besides
grady
no
horse
could
run
immediately
after
a
sea
voyage
do
you
remember
what
a
show
we
made
of
peter
simple
at
kilrue
to
be
shure
i
does
my
lord
besides
they
proper
gallops
there
which
we
have
and
they
betther
manes
of
measuring
horses
why
they
can
measure
a
horse
to
half
a
pound
and
tell
his
rale
pace
on
a
course
to
a
couple
of
take
the
sheets
off
larry
and
let
his
lordship
run
his
hand
over
him
he
as
bright
as
a
star
is
he
i
think
you
getting
him
too
fine
i
sure
scott
say
so
do
mind
him
my
lord
he
not
like
one
of
those
english
cats
with
jist
a
dash
of
speed
about
and
nothing
more
brutes
that
they
put
in
training
half
a
dozen
times
in
as
many
months
thim
animals
pick
up
a
lot
of
loose
flabby
flesh
in
no
time
and
loses
it
in
less
and
in
course
av
they
gets
a
sweat
too
much
there
nothin
left
in
not
a
hapoth
brien
a
different
guess
sort
of
animal
from
that
were
you
going
to
have
him
out
grady
why
we
was
not
that
is
only
just
for
walking
exercise
with
his
sheets
on
but
a
canter
down
the
half
mile
slope
and
up
again
by
the
bushes
wo
go
agin
him
well
saddle
him
then
and
let
pat
get
up
yes
my
lord
and
brien
was
saddled
by
the
two
men
together
with
much
care
and
ceremony
and
pat
was
put
up
and
now
pat
continued
grady
keep
him
well
in
hand
down
the
slope
do
let
him
out
at
all
at
all
till
you
come
to
the
turn
when
you
fairly
round
the
corner
just
shake
your
reins
the
laste
in
life
and
when
you
halfway
up
the
rise
when
the
lad
begins
to
snort
a
bit
let
him
just
see
the
end
of
the
switch
just
raise
it
till
it
catches
his
eye
and
av
he
show
that
he
disposed
for
running
i
mistaken
we
step
across
to
the
bushes
my
lord
and
see
him
come
round
lord
ballindine
and
the
managing
man
walked
across
to
the
bushes
accordingly
and
pat
did
exactly
as
he
was
desired
it
was
a
pretty
thing
to
see
the
beautiful
young
animal
with
his
sleek
brown
coat
shining
like
a
lady
curls
arching
his
neck
and
throwing
down
his
head
in
his
impatience
to
start
he
was
the
very
picture
of
health
and
symmetry
when
he
flung
up
his
head
you
think
the
blood
was
running
from
his
nose
his
nostrils
were
so
ruddy
bright
he
cantered
off
in
great
impatience
and
fretted
and
fumed
because
the
little
fellow
on
his
back
would
be
the
master
and
not
let
him
have
his
play
down
the
slope
and
round
the
corner
by
the
trees
it
was
beautiful
to
watch
him
his
motions
were
so
easy
so
graceful
at
the
turn
he
answered
to
the
boy
encouragement
and
mended
his
pace
till
again
he
felt
the
bridle
and
then
as
the
jock
barely
moved
his
right
arm
he
bounded
up
the
rising
ground
past
the
spot
where
lord
ballindine
and
the
trainer
were
standing
and
shot
away
till
he
was
beyond
the
place
where
he
knew
his
gallop
ordinarily
ended
as
grady
said
he
had
yet
been
stretched
he
had
never
yet
tried
his
own
pace
and
he
had
that
look
so
beautiful
in
a
horse
when
running
of
working
at
his
ease
and
much
within
his
power
he
a
beautiful
creature
said
lord
ballindine
as
he
mournfully
reflected
that
he
was
about
to
give
up
to
dot
blake
half
the
possession
of
his
favourite
and
the
whole
of
the
nominal
title
it
was
such
a
pity
he
should
be
so
hampered
the
mere
of
possessing
such
a
horse
was
so
great
a
pleasure
he
is
a
fine
creature
said
he
and
i
am
sure
will
do
well
your
lordship
may
say
that
he
go
precious
nigh
to
astonish
the
saxons
i
think
i
suppose
the
at
the
derby
be
nigh
four
thousand
this
year
i
suppose
it
will
something
like
that
well
i
would
like
a
nag
out
of
our
stables
to
do
the
trick
on
the
downs
and
av
we
does
it
iver
it
be
now
mr
igoe
standing
a
deal
of
cash
on
him
i
wonder
is
mr
blake
standing
much
on
him
my
lord
you
be
precious
deep
grady
if
you
could
find
what
he
doing
in
that
way
that
thrue
for
you
my
lord
but
av
he
or
your
lordship
wants
to
get
more
on
now
the
time
i
lay
twenty
thousand
pounds
this
moment
that
afther
he
been
a
fortnight
at
johnny
scott
the
odds
agin
him
wo
be
more
than
ten
to
one
from
that
day
till
the
morning
he
comes
out
on
the
downs
i
dare
say
not
i
wondher
who
your
lordship
put
up
that
must
depend
on
scott
and
what
sort
of
a
string
he
has
running
he
nothing
as
yet
high
in
the
betting
except
hardicanute
nothing
my
lord
and
take
my
word
for
it
that
horse
is
ownly
jist
run
up
for
the
sake
of
the
betting
that
not
his
nathural
position
well
pat
you
may
take
the
saddle
off
will
your
lordship
see
the
mare
out
not
grady
let
see
what
the
day
she
runs
the
fifteenth
of
may
my
lord
i
afraid
mr
watts
patriot
be
too
much
for
her
that
av
he
run
kind
but
he
do
do
that
always
well
good
morning
to
your
lordship
good
morning
grady
and
frank
rode
back
towards
handicap
lodge
he
had
a
great
contest
with
himself
on
his
road
home
he
had
hated
the
horses
two
days
since
when
he
was
at
grey
abbey
and
had
hated
himself
for
having
become
their
possessor
and
now
he
could
bear
the
thought
of
parting
with
them
to
be
steward
of
the
curragh
to
own
the
best
horse
of
the
year
and
to
win
the
derby
were
very
pleasant
things
in
themselves
and
for
what
was
he
going
to
give
over
all
this
glory
pleasure
and
profit
to
another
to
please
a
girl
who
had
rejected
him
even
jilted
him
and
to
appease
an
old
earl
who
had
already
turned
him
out
of
his
house
no
he
would
do
it
by
the
time
that
he
was
half
a
mile
from
igoe
stables
he
had
determined
that
as
the
girl
was
gone
it
would
be
a
pity
to
throw
the
horses
after
her
he
would
finish
this
year
on
the
turf
and
then
if
fanny
wyndham
was
still
her
own
mistress
after
christmas
he
would
again
ask
her
her
mind
if
she
a
girl
of
spirit
he
said
to
himself
and
nobody
knows
better
than
i
do
that
she
is
she
wo
like
me
the
worse
for
having
shown
that
i
not
to
be
led
by
the
nose
by
a
pompous
old
fool
like
lord
cashel
and
he
rode
on
fortifying
himself
in
this
resolution
for
the
second
half
mile
but
what
the
deuce
should
he
do
about
money
there
was
only
one
more
half
mile
before
he
was
again
at
handicap
guinness
people
had
his
and
he
knew
he
had
twelve
hundred
a
year
after
paying
the
interest
of
the
old
incumbrances
they
had
advanced
him
much
since
he
came
of
age
certainly
not
above
five
thousand
pounds
and
it
surely
was
very
hard
he
could
not
get
five
or
six
hundred
pounds
when
he
wanted
it
so
much
it
was
very
hard
that
he
should
be
able
to
do
what
he
liked
with
his
own
like
the
duke
of
newcastle
however
the
money
must
be
had
he
must
pay
blake
and
tierney
the
balance
of
what
they
had
won
at
whist
and
the
horse
could
go
over
the
water
till
the
wind
was
raised
if
he
was
driven
very
hard
he
might
get
something
from
martin
kelly
these
unpleasant
cogitations
brought
him
over
the
third
half
mile
and
he
rode
through
the
gate
of
handicap
lodge
in
a
desperate
state
of
indecision
i
tell
you
what
i
do
dot
he
said
when
he
met
his
friend
coming
in
from
his
morning
work
and
i
deuced
sorry
to
do
it
for
i
shall
be
giving
you
the
best
horse
of
his
year
and
something
tells
me
he
win
the
derby
i
suppose
means
old
jack
igoe
or
that
blackguard
grady
said
dot
but
as
to
his
winning
that
as
it
may
be
you
know
the
chances
are
sixteen
to
one
he
wo
upon
my
honour
i
do
think
they
are
will
you
take
twelve
to
one
ah
youk
now
dot
i
not
now
wanting
to
bet
on
the
horse
with
you
i
was
only
saying
that
i
a
kind
of
inward
conviction
that
he
will
win
my
dear
frank
said
the
other
if
men
selling
horses
could
also
sell
their
inward
convictions
with
them
what
a
lot
of
articles
of
that
description
there
would
be
in
the
market
but
what
were
you
going
to
say
you
do
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
agree
to
your
terms
providing
pay
half
the
expenses
of
the
horses
since
the
last
race
each
of
them
ran
you
must
see
that
would
be
only
fair
supposing
the
horses
belonged
to
you
equally
with
me
ever
since
that
time
it
would
be
quite
fair
no
doubt
if
i
agreed
to
it
it
would
be
quite
fair
also
if
i
agreed
to
give
you
five
hundred
pounds
but
i
will
do
neither
one
nor
the
other
but
look
here
dot
brien
ran
for
the
autumn
produce
stakes
last
october
and
won
them
since
then
he
has
done
nothing
to
reimburse
me
for
his
expense
nor
yet
has
anything
been
taken
out
of
him
by
running
surely
if
you
are
to
have
half
the
profits
you
should
at
any
rate
pay
half
the
expenses
that
very
well
put
frank
and
if
you
and
i
stood
upon
equal
ground
with
an
arbiter
between
us
by
whose
decision
we
were
bound
to
abide
and
to
whom
the
settlement
of
the
question
was
entrusted
your
arguments
would
no
doubt
be
successful
but
well
that
the
fair
way
of
looking
at
it
but
as
i
was
going
to
say
that
not
the
case
we
are
neither
of
us
bound
to
take
any
one
decision
and
therefore
any
terms
which
either
of
us
chooses
to
accept
must
be
fair
now
i
have
told
you
my
terms
the
lowest
price
if
you
like
to
call
it
so
at
which
i
will
give
your
horses
the
benefit
of
my
experience
and
save
you
from
their
immediate
pecuniary
pressure
and
i
will
neither
take
any
other
terms
nor
will
i
press
these
on
you
why
blake
i
sooner
deal
with
all
the
jews
of
israel
stop
frank
one
word
of
abuse
and
i
wash
my
hands
of
the
matter
altogether
wash
away
then
i
keep
the
horses
though
i
have
to
sell
my
hunters
and
the
plate
at
kelly
court
into
the
bargain
i
was
going
to
add
only
your
energy
far
too
great
to
allow
of
a
slow
steady
man
like
me
finishing
his
sentence
i
was
going
to
say
that
if
you
pressed
for
money
as
you
say
and
if
it
will
be
any
accommodation
i
will
let
you
have
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
at
five
per
cent
on
the
security
of
the
horses
that
is
that
you
will
be
charged
with
that
amount
and
the
interest
in
the
final
closing
of
the
account
at
the
end
of
the
year
before
the
horses
are
restored
to
you
had
an
uninterested
observer
been
standing
by
he
might
have
seen
with
half
an
eye
that
blake
coolness
was
put
on
and
that
his
indifference
to
the
bargain
was
assumed
this
offer
of
the
loan
was
a
second
bid
when
he
found
the
first
was
likely
to
be
rejected
it
was
made
too
at
the
time
that
he
was
positively
declaring
that
he
would
make
none
but
the
first
offer
poor
frank
he
was
utterly
unable
to
cope
with
his
friend
at
the
weapons
with
which
they
were
playing
and
he
was
consequently
most
egregiously
plundered
but
it
was
in
an
affair
of
and
the
sporting
world
when
it
learned
the
terms
on
which
the
horses
were
transferred
from
lord
ballindine
name
to
that
of
mr
blake
had
not
a
word
of
censure
to
utter
against
the
latter
he
was
pronounced
to
be
very
wide
awake
and
decidedly
at
the
top
of
his
profession
and
lord
ballindine
was
spoken
of
for
a
week
with
considerable
pity
and
contempt
when
blake
mentioned
the
loan
frank
got
up
and
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
then
bit
his
lips
and
walked
twice
up
and
down
the
room
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
then
he
paused
looked
out
of
the
window
and
attempted
to
whistle
then
he
threw
himself
into
an
armchair
poked
out
both
his
legs
as
far
as
he
could
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair
and
set
to
work
hard
to
make
up
his
mind
but
it
was
no
good
in
about
five
minutes
he
found
he
could
not
do
it
so
he
took
out
his
purse
and
extracting
threw
it
up
to
the
ceiling
saying
well
dot
head
or
harp
if
you
right
you
have
them
harp
cried
dot
they
both
examined
the
coin
they
yours
said
frank
with
much
solemnity
and
now
you
got
the
best
horse
yes
i
believe
the
very
best
horse
alive
for
nothing
only
half
of
him
frank
well
said
frank
it
done
now
i
suppose
oh
of
course
it
is
said
dot
i
draw
out
the
agreement
and
give
you
a
cheque
for
the
money
and
so
he
did
and
frank
wrote
a
letter
to
igoe
authorizing
him
to
hand
over
the
horses
to
mr
blake
groom
stating
that
he
had
sold
them
for
so
ran
his
agreement
with
dot
and
desiring
that
his
bill
for
training
might
be
forthwith
forwarded
to
kelly
court
poor
frank
he
was
ashamed
to
go
to
take
a
last
look
at
his
dear
favourites
and
tell
his
own
trainer
that
he
had
sold
his
own
horses
the
next
morning
saw
him
with
his
servant
on
the
ballinasloe
coach
travelling
towards
kelly
court
and
also
saw
brien
boru
granuell
and
finn
led
across
the
downs
from
igoe
stables
to
handicap
lodge
the
handsome
sheets
hoods
and
rollers
in
which
they
had
hitherto
appeared
and
on
which
the
initial
b
was
alone
conspicuous
were
carefully
folded
up
and
they
were
henceforth
seen
in
plainer
but
as
serviceable
apparel
labelled
b
will
you
give
fourteen
to
one
against
brien
boru
said
viscount
avoca
to
lord
tathenham
corner
about
ten
days
after
this
at
tattersall
i
will
said
lord
tathenham
in
hundreds
said
the
sharp
irishman
very
well
said
lord
tathenham
and
the
bet
was
booked
you
did
know
i
suppose
said
the
successful
viscount
that
dot
blake
has
bought
brien
boru
and
who
the
devil
dot
blake
said
lord
tathenham
oh
you
know
before
may
over
said
the
viscount
xvii
martin
kelly
courtship
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
tuam
attorney
daly
dined
with
barry
lynch
at
dunmore
house
on
the
same
evening
that
martin
kelly
reached
home
after
his
dublin
excursion
and
that
on
that
occasion
a
good
deal
of
interesting
conversation
took
place
after
dinner
barry
however
was
hardly
amenable
to
reason
at
that
social
hour
and
it
was
not
till
the
following
morning
that
he
became
thoroughly
convinced
that
it
would
be
perfectly
impossible
for
him
to
make
his
sister
out
a
lunatic
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
chancellor
he
then
agreed
to
abandon
the
idea
and
in
lieu
of
it
to
indict
or
at
any
rate
to
threaten
to
indict
the
widow
kelly
and
her
son
for
a
conspiracy
and
an
attempt
to
inveigle
his
sister
anty
into
a
disgraceful
marriage
with
the
object
of
swindling
her
out
of
her
property
i
see
moylan
mr
lynch
said
daly
and
if
i
can
talk
him
over
i
think
we
might
succeed
in
frightening
the
whole
set
of
them
so
far
as
to
prevent
the
marriage
moylan
must
know
that
if
your
sister
was
to
marry
young
kelly
there
be
an
end
to
his
agency
but
we
must
promise
him
something
mr
lynch
yes
i
suppose
we
must
pay
him
before
we
get
anything
out
of
him
no
not
before
but
he
must
understand
that
he
will
get
something
if
he
makes
himself
useful
you
must
let
me
explain
to
him
that
if
the
marriage
is
prevented
you
will
make
no
objection
to
his
continuing
to
act
as
miss
lynch
agent
and
i
might
hint
the
possibility
of
his
receiving
the
rents
on
the
whole
property
hint
what
you
like
daly
but
do
tie
me
down
to
the
infernal
ruffian
i
suppose
we
can
throw
him
overboard
afterwards
ca
we
why
not
altogether
mr
lynch
if
i
make
him
a
definite
promise
i
shall
expect
you
to
keep
to
it
confound
him
but
tell
me
daly
what
is
it
he
to
do
and
what
is
it
we
to
do
why
mr
lynch
it
more
than
probable
i
think
that
this
plan
of
martin
kelly
marrying
your
sisther
may
have
been
talked
over
between
the
ould
woman
moylan
and
the
young
man
and
if
so
that
something
like
a
conspiracy
if
i
could
worm
that
out
of
him
i
think
i
manage
to
frighten
them
and
what
the
deuce
had
i
better
do
you
see
there
was
a
bit
of
a
row
between
us
that
is
anty
got
frightened
when
i
spoke
to
her
of
this
rascal
and
then
she
left
the
house
could
you
make
her
understand
that
she
be
all
right
if
she
come
to
the
house
again
while
barry
lynch
had
been
sleeping
off
the
effects
of
the
punch
daly
had
been
inquiring
into
the
circumstances
under
which
anty
had
left
the
house
and
he
had
pretty
nearly
learned
the
truth
he
knew
therefore
how
much
belief
to
give
to
his
client
representation
i
do
think
said
he
that
your
sister
will
be
likely
to
come
back
at
present
she
will
probably
find
herself
quieter
and
easier
at
the
inn
you
see
she
has
been
used
to
a
quiet
life
but
if
she
remains
there
she
can
marry
that
young
ruffian
any
moment
she
takes
it
into
her
head
to
do
so
there
always
some
rogue
of
a
priest
ready
to
do
a
job
of
that
sort
exactly
so
mr
lynch
of
course
your
sister
can
marry
whom
she
pleases
and
when
she
pleases
and
neither
you
nor
any
one
else
can
prevent
her
but
still
then
what
the
devil
the
use
of
my
paying
you
to
come
here
and
tell
me
that
that
your
affair
i
did
come
without
being
sent
for
but
i
was
going
to
tell
you
that
though
we
ca
prevent
her
from
marrying
if
she
pleases
we
may
make
her
afraid
to
do
so
you
had
better
write
her
a
kind
affectionate
note
regretting
what
has
taken
place
between
you
and
promising
to
give
her
no
molestation
of
any
kind
if
she
will
return
to
her
own
house
and
keep
a
copy
of
this
letter
then
i
will
see
moylan
and
if
i
can
do
anything
with
him
it
will
be
necessary
that
you
should
also
see
him
you
could
come
over
to
tuam
and
meet
him
in
my
office
and
then
i
will
try
and
force
an
entrance
into
the
widow
castle
and
if
possible
see
your
sister
and
humbug
the
ould
woman
into
a
belief
that
she
has
laid
herself
open
to
criminal
indictment
we
might
even
go
so
far
as
to
have
notices
served
on
them
but
if
they
snap
their
fingers
at
us
we
can
do
nothing
further
my
advice
in
that
case
would
be
that
you
should
make
the
best
terms
in
your
power
with
martin
kelly
and
let
the
whole
thing
go
i
sooner
why
daly
i
believe
you
as
bad
as
blake
you
afraid
of
these
huxtering
thieves
if
you
go
on
in
that
way
mr
lynch
you
get
no
professional
gentleman
to
act
with
you
i
give
you
my
best
advice
it
you
do
like
it
you
need
follow
it
but
you
wo
get
a
solicitor
in
connaught
to
do
better
for
you
than
what
i
proposing
confusion
muttered
barry
and
he
struck
the
hot
turf
in
the
grate
a
desperate
blow
with
the
tongs
which
he
had
in
his
hands
and
sent
the
sparks
and
bits
of
fire
flying
about
the
hearth
the
truth
is
you
see
your
sister
in
her
full
senses
there
the
divil
a
doubt
of
that
the
money
her
own
and
she
can
marry
whom
she
pleases
all
that
we
can
do
is
to
try
and
make
the
kellys
think
they
have
got
into
a
scrape
but
this
letter
what
on
earth
am
i
to
say
to
her
i
just
put
down
what
i
would
say
were
i
you
and
if
you
like
you
can
copy
it
daly
then
wrote
the
following
letter
my
dear
anty
before
taking
other
steps
which
could
not
fail
of
being
very
disagreeable
to
you
and
to
others
i
wish
to
point
out
to
you
how
injudiciously
you
are
acting
in
leaving
your
own
house
and
to
try
to
induce
you
to
do
that
which
will
be
most
beneficial
to
yourself
and
most
conducive
to
your
happiness
and
respectability
if
you
will
return
to
dunmore
house
i
most
solemnly
promise
to
leave
you
unmolested
i
much
regret
that
my
violence
on
thursday
should
have
annoyed
you
but
i
can
assure
you
it
was
attributable
merely
to
my
anxiety
on
your
account
nothing
however
shall
induce
me
to
repeat
it
but
you
must
be
aware
that
a
little
inn
is
not
a
fit
place
for
you
to
be
stopping
at
and
i
am
obliged
to
tell
you
that
i
have
conclusive
evidence
of
a
conspiracy
having
been
formed
by
the
family
with
whom
you
are
staying
to
get
possession
of
your
money
and
that
this
conspiracy
was
entered
into
very
shortly
after
the
contents
of
my
father
will
had
been
made
public
i
have
this
fact
proved
at
the
assizes
and
the
disreputable
parties
to
it
punished
unless
you
will
consent
at
any
rate
for
a
time
to
put
yourself
under
the
protection
of
your
brother
in
the
meantime
pray
believe
me
dear
anty
in
spite
of
appearances
your
affectionate
brother
barry
lynch
it
was
then
agreed
that
this
letter
should
be
copied
and
signed
by
barry
and
delivered
by
terry
on
the
following
morning
which
was
sunday
daly
then
returned
to
tuam
with
no
warm
admiration
for
his
client
in
the
meantime
the
excitement
at
the
inn
arising
from
anty
arrival
and
martin
return
was
gradually
subsiding
these
two
important
events
both
happening
on
the
same
day
sadly
upset
the
domestic
economy
of
mrs
kelly
establishment
sally
had
indulged
in
tea
almost
to
stupefaction
and
kattie
elfin
locks
became
more
than
ordinarily
disordered
on
the
following
morning
however
things
seemed
to
fall
a
little
more
into
their
places
the
widow
was
as
usual
behind
her
counter
and
if
her
girls
did
not
give
her
as
much
assistance
as
she
desired
of
them
and
as
much
as
was
usual
with
them
they
were
perhaps
excusable
for
they
could
not
well
leave
their
new
guest
alone
on
the
day
after
her
coming
to
them
martin
went
out
early
to
toneroe
doubtless
the
necessary
labours
of
the
incipient
spring
required
him
at
the
farm
but
i
believe
that
if
his
motives
were
analysed
he
hardly
felt
himself
up
to
a
with
his
mistress
before
he
had
enjoyed
a
cool
day
consideration
of
the
extraordinary
circumstances
which
had
brought
her
into
the
inn
as
his
mother
guest
he
moreover
wished
to
have
a
little
undisturbed
conversation
with
meg
and
to
learn
from
her
how
anty
might
be
inclined
towards
him
just
at
present
so
martin
spent
his
morning
among
his
lambs
and
his
ploughs
and
was
walking
home
towards
dusk
tired
enough
when
he
met
barry
lynch
on
horseback
that
hero
having
come
out
as
usual
for
his
solitary
ride
to
indulge
in
useless
dreams
of
the
happy
times
he
would
have
were
his
sister
only
removed
from
her
tribulations
in
this
world
though
martin
had
never
been
on
friendly
terms
with
his
more
ambitious
neighbour
there
had
never
up
to
this
time
been
any
quarrel
between
them
and
he
therefore
just
muttered
good
morning
mr
lynch
as
he
passed
him
on
the
road
barry
said
nothing
and
did
not
appear
to
see
him
as
he
passed
but
some
idea
struck
him
as
soon
as
he
had
passed
and
he
pulled
in
his
horse
and
hallooed
out
kelly
and
as
martin
stopped
he
added
come
here
a
moment
i
want
to
speak
to
you
well
mr
barry
what
is
it
said
the
other
returning
lynch
paused
and
evidently
did
not
know
whether
to
speak
or
let
it
alone
at
last
he
said
never
mind
i
get
somebody
else
to
say
what
i
was
going
to
say
but
you
better
look
sharp
what
you
about
my
lad
or
find
yourself
in
a
scrape
that
you
do
dream
of
and
is
that
all
you
called
me
back
for
said
martin
that
all
i
mean
to
say
to
you
at
present
well
then
mr
lynch
i
must
say
you
very
good
and
i
shure
i
will
look
sharp
enough
but
to
my
thinking
know
you
want
looking
afther
yourself
a
precious
dale
more
than
i
do
and
then
he
turned
to
proceed
homewards
but
said
as
he
was
going
have
you
any
message
for
your
sisther
mr
lynch
by
my
young
man
i
make
you
pay
for
what
you
doing
answered
barry
i
know
you
be
glad
to
hear
she
pretty
well
she
coming
round
from
the
thratement
she
got
the
other
night
though
by
all
accounts
it
a
wondher
she
alive
this
moment
to
tell
of
it
barry
did
not
attempt
any
further
reply
but
rode
on
sorry
enough
that
he
had
commenced
the
conversation
martin
got
home
in
time
for
a
snug
tea
with
anty
and
his
sisters
and
succeeded
in
prevailing
on
the
three
to
take
each
a
glass
of
punch
and
before
anty
went
to
bed
he
began
to
find
himself
more
at
his
ease
with
her
and
able
to
call
her
by
her
christian
name
without
any
disagreeable
emotion
he
certainly
had
a
most
able
coadjutor
in
meg
she
made
room
on
the
sofa
for
him
between
herself
and
his
mistress
and
then
contrived
that
the
room
should
be
barely
sufficient
so
that
anty
was
rather
closely
hemmed
up
in
one
corner
moreover
she
made
anty
give
her
opinion
as
to
martin
looks
after
his
metropolitan
excursion
and
tried
hard
to
make
martin
pay
some
compliments
to
anty
appearance
but
in
this
she
failed
although
she
gave
him
numerous
opportunities
however
they
passed
the
evening
very
comfortably
quite
sufficiently
so
to
make
anty
feel
that
the
kindly
humble
friendship
of
the
inn
was
infinitely
preferable
to
the
miserable
grandeur
of
dunmore
house
and
it
is
probable
that
all
the
lovemaking
in
the
world
would
not
have
operated
so
strongly
in
martin
favour
as
this
feeling
meg
however
was
not
satisfied
for
as
soon
as
she
had
seen
jane
and
anty
into
the
she
returned
to
her
brother
and
lectured
him
as
to
his
lukewarm
manifestations
of
affection
martin
said
she
returning
into
the
little
and
carefully
shutting
the
door
after
her
you
the
biggest
bosthoon
of
a
gandher
i
ever
see
to
be
losing
your
opportunities
with
anty
this
way
i
it
waiting
you
are
for
herself
to
come
forward
to
you
do
you
think
a
young
woman
do
expect
something
more
from
a
lover
than
jist
for
you
to
sit
by
her
and
go
on
all
as
one
as
though
she
was
one
of
your
own
sisthers
av
once
she
gets
out
of
this
before
the
priest
has
made
one
of
the
two
of
you
mind
i
tell
you
it
be
all
up
with
you
i
wondher
martin
you
have
got
more
pluck
in
you
oh
bother
meg
you
thinking
of
nothing
but
kissing
and
anty
not
the
same
as
you
and
jane
and
does
be
all
agog
for
such
nonsense
i
tell
you
martin
anty

woman
and
take
my
word
for
it
what
another
girl
likes
wo
come
amiss
to
her
besides
why
do
you
spake
to
her
spake
why
what
would
you
have
me
spake
well
martin
you
a
fool
have
you
or
have
you
not
made
up
your
mind
to
marry
anty
to
be
shure
i
will
av
she
have
me
and
do
you
expect
her
to
have
you
without
asking
shure
you
know
did
i
ask
her
often
enough
ah
but
you
must
do
more
than
jist
ask
her
that
way
she
never
make
up
her
mind
to
go
before
the
priest
unless
you
say
something
sthronger
to
her
jist
tell
her
plump
out
you
ready
and
willing
and
get
the
thing
done
before
lent
what
to
hindher
you
shure
you
know
she
added
in
a
whisper
you
not
get
sich
a
fortune
as
anty
in
your
way
every
day
spake
out
man
and
do
be
afraid
of
her
take
my
word
she
wo
like
you
a
bit
the
worse
for
a
few
kisses
martin
promised
to
comply
with
his
sister
advice
and
to
sound
anty
touching
their
marriage
on
the
following
morning
after
mass
on
the
sunday
morning
at
breakfast
the
widow
proposed
to
anty
that
she
should
go
to
mass
with
herself
and
her
daughters
but
anty
trembled
so
violently
at
the
idea
of
showing
herself
in
public
after
her
escape
from
dunmore
house
that
the
widow
did
not
press
her
to
do
so
although
afterwards
she
expressed
her
disapprobation
of
anty
conduct
to
her
own
girls
i
do
see
what
she
has
to
be
afeard
of
said
she
in
going
to
get
mass
from
her
own
clergyman
in
her
own
chapel
she
do
think
i
suppose
that
barry
lynch
dare
come
in
there
to
pull
her
out
before
the
blessed
altar
glory
be
to
god
ah
but
mother
you
know
she
has
been
so
frighted
frighted
indeed
she
get
over
these
tantrums
i
hope
before
sunday
next
or
i
know
where
i
wish
her
again
so
anty
was
left
at
home
and
the
rest
of
the
family
went
to
mass
when
the
women
returned
meg
manoeuvred
greatly
and
in
fine
successfully
that
no
one
should
enter
the
little
parlour
to
interrupt
the
wooing
she
intended
should
take
place
there
she
had
no
difficulty
with
jane
for
she
told
her
what
her
plans
were
and
though
her
less
energetic
sister
did
not
quite
agree
in
the
wisdom
of
her
designs
and
pronounced
an
opinion
that
it
would
be
better
to
let
things
settle
down
a
bit
still
she
did
not
presume
to
run
counter
to
meg
views
but
meg
had
some
work
to
dispose
of
her
mother
it
would
not
have
answered
at
all
as
meg
had
very
well
learned
herself
to
caution
her
mother
not
to
interrupt
martin
in
his
for
the
widow
had
no
charity
for
such
follies
she
certainly
expected
her
daughters
to
get
married
and
wished
them
to
be
well
and
speedily
settled
but
she
watched
anything
like
a
flirtation
on
their
part
as
closely
as
a
cat
does
a
mouse
if
any
young
man
were
in
the
house
she
listen
to
the
fall
of
his
footsteps
with
the
utmost
care
and
when
she
had
reason
to
fear
that
there
was
anything
like
a
lengthened
upstairs
she
would
steal
on
the
pair
if
possible
unawares
and
interrupt
without
the
least
reserve
any
billing
and
cooing
which
might
be
going
on
sending
the
delinquent
daughter
to
her
work
and
giving
a
glower
at
the
swain
which
she
expected
might
be
sufficient
to
deter
him
from
similar
offences
for
some
little
time
the
girls
consequently
were
taught
to
be
on
the
alert
to
steal
about
on
tiptoe
to
elude
their
mother
watchful
ear
to
have
recourse
to
a
thousand
little
methods
of
deceiving
her
and
to
baffle
her
with
her
own
weapons
the
mother
if
she
suspected
that
any
prohibited
frolic
was
likely
to
be
carried
on
at
a
late
hour
would
tell
her
daughters
that
she
was
going
to
bed
and
would
shut
herself
up
for
a
couple
of
hours
in
her
and
then
steal
out
eavesdropping
peeping
through
and
listening
at
and
the
daughters
knowing
their
mother
practice
would
not
come
forth
till
the
listening
and
peeping
had
been
completed
and
till
they
had
ascertained
by
some
infallible
means
that
the
old
woman
was
between
the
sheets
each
party
knew
the
tricks
of
the
other
and
yet
taking
it
all
in
all
the
widow
got
on
very
well
with
her
children
and
everybody
said
what
a
good
mother
she
had
been
she
was
accustomed
to
use
deceit
and
was
therefore
not
disgusted
by
it
in
others
whether
the
system
of
domestic
manners
which
i
have
described
is
one
likely
to
induce
to
sound
restraint
and
good
morals
is
a
question
which
i
will
leave
to
be
discussed
by
writers
on
educational
points
however
meg
managed
it
she
did
contrive
that
her
mother
should
not
go
near
the
little
parlour
this
sunday
morning
and
anty
was
left
alone
to
receive
her
lover
visit
i
regret
to
say
that
he
was
long
in
paying
it
he
loitered
about
the
chapel
gates
before
he
came
home
and
seemed
more
than
usually
willing
to
talk
to
anyone
about
anything
at
last
however
just
as
meg
was
getting
furious
he
entered
the
inn
why
martin
you
born
ideot
av
she
ai
waiting
for
you
this
hour
and
more
thim
that
long
waited
for
is
always
welcome
when
they
do
come
replied
martin
well
afther
all
i
done
for
you
are
you
going
in
now
cause
you
do
i
go
and
tell
her
not
to
be
tasing
herself
about
you
i
neither
be
art
or
part
in
any
such
schaming
schaming
is
it
meg
faith
it
be
a
clever
fellow
beat
you
at
that
and
without
waiting
for
his
sister
sharp
reply
he
walked
into
the
little
room
where
anty
was
sitting
so
anty
you
would
come
to
mass
he
began
maybe
i
go
next
sunday
said
she
it
a
long
time
since
you
missed
mass
before
i
thinking
not
since
the
sunday
afther
father
death
it
little
you
were
thinking
then
how
soon
you
be
stopping
down
here
with
us
at
the
inn
that
thrue
for
you
martin
god
knows
at
this
point
of
the
conversation
martin
stuck
fast
he
did
not
know
rosalind
recipe
for
the
difficulty
a
man
feels
when
he
finds
himself
gravelled
for
conversation
with
his
mistress
so
he
merely
scratched
his
head
and
thought
hard
to
find
what
he
say
next
i
doubt
whether
the
conviction
which
was
then
strong
on
his
mind
that
meg
was
listening
at
the
keyhole
to
every
word
that
passed
at
all
assisted
him
in
the
operation
at
last
some
muse
came
to
his
aid
and
he
made
out
another
sentence
footnote
rosalind
recipe
in
you
like
act
iii
sc
ii
rosalind
disguised
as
a
young
man
instructs
orlando
to
practice
his
wooing
on
her
it
was
very
odd
my
finding
you
down
here
all
ready
before
me
it
it
was
your
mother
was
a
very
good
woman
to
me
that
morning
anyhow
and
tell
me
now
anty
do
you
like
the
inn
i
do
but
it
quare
like
how
quare
why
having
meg
and
jane
here
i
was
ever
used
to
anyone
to
talk
to
only
just
the
servants
you
have
plenty
always
to
talk
to
now
eh
anty
and
martin
tried
a
sweet
look
at
his
lady
love
i
shure
i
do
know
av
i
only
left
quiet
that
what
i
most
care
about
but
anty
tell
me
you
do
want
always
to
be
what
you
call
quiet
oh
but
i
do
why
not
but
you
do
mane
anty
that
you
would
like
to
have
some
kind
of
work
to
do
some
occupation
like
why
i
would
like
to
be
idle
but
a
person
need
be
idle
because
they
quiet
and
that
thrue
anty
and
martin
broke
down
again
there
be
a
great
crowd
in
chapel
i
suppose
said
anty
there
was
a
great
crowd
and
what
was
father
geoghegan
preaching
about
well
then
i
did
mind
to
tell
the
truth
anty
i
came
out
most
as
soon
as
the
preaching
began
only
i
know
he
told
the
boys
to
pray
that
the
liberathor
might
be
got
out
of
his
throubles
and
so
they
should
not
that
there
much
to
throuble
him
as
far
as
the
concerned
is
there
then
i
thought
they
made
him
out
guilty
so
they
did
the
false
ruffians
but
what
harum
that
do
they
dare
touch
a
hair
of
his
head
politics
however
are
not
a
favourable
introduction
to
so
martin
felt
and
again
gave
up
the
subject
in
the
hopes
that
he
might
find
something
better
what
a
fool
the
man
is
thought
meg
to
herself
at
the
door
if
i
had
a
lover
went
on
like
that
would
i
pull
his
ears
martin
got
up
walked
across
the
room
looked
out
of
the
little
window
felt
very
much
ashamed
of
himself
and
returning
sat
himself
down
on
the
sofa
anty
he
said
at
last
blushing
nearly
brown
as
he
spoke
were
you
thinking
of
what
i
was
spaking
to
you
about
before
i
went
to
dublin
anty
blushed
also
now
about
what
she
said
why
just
about
you
and
me
making
a
match
of
it
come
anty
dear
what
the
good
of
losing
time
i
been
thinking
of
little
else
and
after
what
been
between
us
you
must
have
thought
the
matther
over
too
though
you
do
let
on
to
be
so
innocent
come
anty
now
that
you
and
mother
so
thick
there
can
be
nothing
against
it
but
indeed
there
is
martin
a
great
dale
against
it
though
i
sure
it
good
of
you
to
be
thinking
of
me
there
so
much
against
it
i
think
we
had
betther
be
of
one
mind
and
give
it
over
at
once
and
what
to
hinder
us
marrying
anty
av
yourself
is
plazed
you
and
i
and
mother
are
plazed
sorrow
a
one
that
i
know
of
has
a
word
to
say
in
the
matther
but
barry
do
like
it
and
afther
all
are
you
going
to
wait
for
what
barry
likes
you
did
wait
for
what
was
plazing
to
barry
lynch
when
you
came
down
here
nor
yet
did
mother
when
she
went
up
and
fetched
you
down
at
five
in
the
morning
dreading
he
murdher
you
outright
and
it
was
thrue
for
her

the
two
of
us
but
it
not
that

it
because

of

because
he
threatened
and
frightened
you
and
what
on
could
he
do
to
harum
you
av
you

suffered
and
i
a
feeling
that

of
it
and
afther

to
tell
me
now
that
i
may
jist
go
my
own
way

that
to
be
your
answer
and
all
i
to
get
from

maning
to
do
everything
for
the
best
maning
what

good
of
maning
anyways
anty
let
me
have
an
answer
for
i
not

making
a
fool
of
myself
any
longer
somehow
all
the
boys
here
every
sowl
in
dunmore
has
it
that
you
and
i
is
to
be
married
and
now
afther
promising
me
as
you
did
oh
i
never
promised
martin
it
was
all
one
as
a
promise
and
now
i
to
be
thrown
overboard
and
why
because
barry
lynch
got
dhrunk
and
frightened
you
av
i
seen
the
ruffian
striking

near
putting
it
beyond
him
to
strike
another
woman
iver
again
glory
be
to
god
that
you
was
near
him
that
night
said
anty
crossing
herself
it
was
bad
enough
but
av
the
two
of
you
should
ever
be
set
fighting
along
of
me
it
would
kill
me
outright
but
who
talking
of
fighting
anty
dear
and
martin
drew
a
little
nearer
to
her
who
talking
of
fighting
i
never
wish
to
spake
another
word
to
barry
the
longest
day
that
ever
comes
av
he
get
out
of
my
way
i
go
bail
he
not
find
me
in
his
but
he
would
get
out
of
your
way
nor
get
out
of
mine
av
you
and
i
got
married
he
be
in
our
way
and
we
be
in
his
and
nothing
could
iver
come
of
it
but
sorrow
and
misery
and
maybe
bloodshed
them
all
a
woman
fears
av
you
an
i
were
once
spliced
by
the
priest
god
bless
him
barry
would
trouble
dunmore
long
afther
that
another
rason
too
why
should
i
be
dhriving
him
out
of
his
own
house
you
know
he
a
right
to
the
house
as
well
as
i
who
talking
of
dhriving
him
out
faith
he
be
welcome
to
stay
there
long
enough
for
me
he
go
fast
enough
without
dhriving
though
you
ca
say
the
counthry
would
have
a
good
riddhance
of
him
but
never
mind
that
anty
it
was
about
barry
one
way
or
the
other
i
was
thinking
when
i
first
asked
you
to
have
me
nor
it
about
myself
altogether
as
i
could
let
you
know
though
in
course
i
not
saying
but
that
myself
as
dear
to
myself
as
another
why
not
but
to
tell
the
blessed
truth
i
was
thinking
av
you
too
and
that
you
be
happier
and
asier
let
alone
betther
an
more
respecthable
as
an
honest
man
wife
as
i
make
you
than
being
mewed
up
there
in
dread
of
your
life
never
daring
to
open
your
mouth
to
a
christian
for
fear
of
your
own
brother
who
niver
did
nor
niver
will
lift
a
hand
to
sarve
you
though
he
was
backward
to
lift
it
to
sthrike
you
woman
and
sisther
though
you
were
come
anty
darlin
he
added
after
a
pause
during
which
he
managed
to
get
his
arm
behind
her
back
though
he
could
be
said
to
have
it
fairly
round
her
waist
get
quit
of
all
these
quandaries
and
say
at
once
like
an
honest
girl
you
do
what
i
asking
and
what
no
living
man
can
hindher
you
from
or
say
against
or
else
jist
fairly
say
you
wo
and
i
have
done
with
it
anty
sat
silent
for
she
did
like
to
say
she
would
and
she
thought
of
her
brother
threats
and
was
afraid
to
say
she
would
martin
advanced
a
little
in
his
proceedings
however
and
now
succeeded
in
getting
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
having
done
so
he
was
slow
in
letting
her
feel
its
pressure
she
made
an
attempt
with
her
hand
to
disengage
herself
certainly
not
a
successful
and
probably
not
a
very
energetic
attempt
when
the
widow
step
was
heard
on
the
stairs
martin
retreated
from
his
position
on
the
sofa
and
meg
from
hers
outside
the
door
and
mrs
kelly
entered
the
room
with
barry
letter
in
her
hand
meg
following
to
ascertain
the
cause
of
the
unfortunate
interruption
xviii
an
attorney
office
in
connaught
anty
here
a
letter
for
ye
began
the
widow
terry
brought
it
down
from
the
house
and
says
it
from
misther
barry
i
he
was
in
the
right
not
to
bring
it
hisself
a
letther
for
me
mrs
kelly
what
can
he
be
writing
about
i
just
know
whether
i
ought
to
open
it
or
no
and
anty
trembled
as
she
turned
the
epistle
over
and
over
again
in
her
hands
what
for
would
you
not
open
it
the
letther
ca
hurt
you
girl
whatever
the
writher
might
do
thus
encouraged
anty
broke
the
seal
and
made
herself
acquainted
with
the
contents
of
the
letter
which
daly
had
dictated
but
she
then
found
that
her
difficulties
had
only
just
commenced
was
she
to
send
an
answer
and
if
so
what
answer
and
if
she
sent
none
what
notice
ought
she
to
take
of
it
the
matter
was
one
evidently
too
weighty
to
be
settled
by
her
own
judgment
so
she
handed
the
letter
to
be
read
first
by
the
widow
and
then
by
martin
and
lastly
by
the
two
girls
who
by
this
time
were
both
in
the
room
well
the
dethermined
impudence
of
that
blackguard
exclaimed
mrs
kelly
conspiracy
av
that
do
bang
banagher
what
does
the
man
mean
by
eh
martin
faith
you
must
ask
himself
that
mother
and
then
it
ten
to
one
he
ca
tell
you
i
suppose
said
meg
he
wants
to
say
that
we
all
schaming
to
rob
anty
of
her
money
only
he
dare
for
the
life
of
him
spake
it
out
straight
forrard
or
maybe
suggested
jane
he
wants
to
bring
something
agen
us
like
this
affair
of
only
he
find
down
here
that
he
got
dublin
soft
goods
to
deal
wid
then
followed
a
consultation
as
to
the
proper
steps
to
be
taken
in
the
matter
the
widow
advised
that
father
geoghegan
should
be
sent
for
to
indite
such
a
reply
as
a
christian
woman
should
send
to
so
base
a
letter
meg
who
was
very
hot
on
the
subject
and
who
had
read
of
some
such
proceeding
in
a
novel
was
for
putting
up
in
a
blank
envelope
the
letter
itself
and
returning
it
to
barry
by
the
hands
of
jack
the
ostler
at
the
same
time
she
declared
that
no
surrender
should
be
her
motto
jane
was
of
opinion
that
miss
anastasia
lynch
compliments
to
mr
barry
lynch
and
she
did
find
herself
strong
enough
to
move
to
dunmore
house
at
present
would
answer
all
purposes
and
be
on
the
whole
the
safest
course
while
martin
pronounced
that
if
anty
would
be
led
by
him
she
just
pitch
the
letter
behind
the
fire
an
take
no
notice
of
it
good
bad
or
indifferent
none
of
these
plans
pleased
anty
for
as
she
remarked
after
all
barry
was
her
brother
and
blood
was
thickher
than
wather
so
after
much
consultation
pen
ink
and
paper
were
procured
and
the
following
letter
was
concocted
between
them
all
the
soft
bits
having
been
great
in
which
however
anty
quiet
perseverance
carried
the
point
in
opposition
to
the
wishes
of
all
the
kellys
the
words
put
in
brackets
were
those
peculiarly
objected
to
dunmore
inn
february
dear
barry
i
am
very
sorry
i
ca
come
back
to
the
house
at
any
rate
just
at
present
i
am
not
very
sthrong
in
health
and
there
are
kind
female
friends
about
me
here
which
you
know
there
could
be
up
at
the
house
anty
herself
in
the
original
draft
inserted
ladies
but
the
good
sense
repudiated
the
term
and
insisted
on
the
word
females
jane
suggested
that
females
did
not
sound
quite
respectful
alone
and
martin
thought
that
anty
might
call
them
female
friends
which
was
consequently
done
besides
there
are
reasons
why
i
quieter
here
till
things
are
a
little
more
settled
i
will
forgive
and
forget
all
that
happened
up
at
the
house
between
us
why
you
ca
forget
it
said
meg
oh
i
could
av
he
was
kind
to
me
i
forget
it
all
in
a
week
av
he
was
kind
to
me
answered
anty
and
i
will
do
nothing
particular
without
first
letting
you
know
they
were
all
loud
against
this
paragraph
but
they
could
not
carry
their
point
i
must
tell
you
dear
barry
that
you
are
very
much
mistaken
about
the
people
of
this
house
they
are
dear
kind
friends
to
me
and
wherever
i
am
i
must
love
them
to
the
last
day
of
my
life
but
indeed
i
am
and
hope
you
believe
so
your
affectionate
sister
anastasia
lynch
when
the
last
paragraph
was
read
over
anty
shoulder
meg
declared
she
was
a
dear
dear
creature
jane
gave
her
a
big
kiss
and
began
crying
even
the
widow
put
the
corner
of
her
apron
to
her
eye
and
martin
trying
to
look
manly
and
unconcerned
declared
that
he
was
quite
shure
they
all
loved
her
and
they
be
brutes
and
bastes
av
they
did
the
letter
as
given
above
was
finally
decided
on
written
sealed
and
despatched
by
jack
who
was
desired
to
be
very
particular
to
deliver
it
at
the
front
door
with
miss
lynch
love
which
was
accordingly
done
all
the
care
however
which
had
been
bestowed
on
it
did
not
make
it
palatable
to
barry
who
was
alone
when
he
received
it
and
merely
muttered
as
he
read
it
confound
her
slut
friends
indeed
what
business
has
she
with
friends
except
such
as
i
please
if
i
the
choosing
of
her
friends
they
be
a
strait
waistcoat
and
the
madhouse
doctor
good
heaven
that
half
my
property
no
but
of
it
should
belong
to
her
the
stupid
robber
these
last
pleasant
epithets
had
reference
to
his
respected
progenitor
on
the
same
evening
after
tea
martin
endeavoured
to
make
a
little
further
advance
with
anty
for
he
felt
that
he
had
been
interrupted
just
as
she
was
coming
round
but
her
nerves
were
again
disordered
and
he
soon
found
that
if
he
pressed
her
now
he
should
only
get
a
decided
negative
which
he
might
find
it
very
difficult
to
induce
her
to
revoke
anty
letter
was
sent
off
early
on
the
monday
morning
at
least
as
early
as
barry
now
ever
managed
to
do
anything
to
the
attorney
at
tuam
with
strong
injunctions
that
no
time
was
to
be
lost
in
taking
further
steps
and
with
a
request
that
daly
would
again
come
out
to
dunmore
this
however
he
did
not
at
present
think
it
expedient
to
do
so
he
wrote
to
barry
begging
him
to
come
into
tuam
on
the
wednesday
to
meet
moylan
whom
he
daly
would
if
possible
contrive
to
see
on
the
intervening
day
obstinate
puppy
said
barry
to
himself
if
he
had
the
least
pluck
in
life
he
have
broken
the
will
or
at
least
made
the
girl
out
a
lunatic
but
a
connaught
lawyer
has
half
the
wit
or
courage
now
that
he
used
to
have
however
he
wrote
a
note
to
daly
agreeing
to
his
proposal
and
promising
to
be
in
tuam
at
two
on
the
wednesday
on
the
following
day
daly
saw
moylan
and
had
a
long
conversation
with
him
the
old
man
held
out
for
a
long
time
expressing
much
indignation
at
being
supposed
capable
of
joining
in
any
underhand
agreement
for
transferring
miss
lynch
property
to
his
relatives
the
kellys
and
declaring
that
he
would
make
public
to
every
one
in
dunmore
and
tuam
the
base
manner
in
which
barry
lynch
was
treating
his
sister
indeed
moylan
kept
to
his
story
so
long
and
so
firmly
that
the
young
attorney
was
nearly
giving
him
up
but
at
last
he
found
his
weak
side
well
mr
moylan
he
said
then
i
can
only
say
your
own
conduct
is
very
disinterested
and
i
might
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
you
appear
to
me
foolishly
indifferent
to
your
own
concerns
here
the
agency
of
the
whole
property
going
the
rents
i
believe
are
about
a
thousand
you
might
be
recaving
them
all
by
jist
a
word
of
your
mouth
and
that
only
telling
the
blessed
truth
and
here
you
going
to
put
the
whole
thing
into
the
hands
of
young
kelly
throwing
up
even
the
half
of
the
business
you
have
got
who
says
i
afther
doing
any
sich
thing
mr
daly
why
martin
kelly
says
so
did
as
many
as
four
or
five
persons
hear
him
say
down
at
dunmore
that
divil
a
one
of
the
tenants
iver
pay
a
haporth
of
the
november
rents
to
anyone
only
jist
to
himself
there
was
father
geoghegan
heard
him
an
doctor
ned
blake
footnote
haporth
worth
maybe
he
find
his
mistake
mr
daly
maybe
he
will
mr
moylan
maybe
we
put
the
whole
affair
into
the
courts
and
have
a
regular
recaver
over
the
property
under
the
chancellor
people
though
they
ever
so
respectable
in
their
way
and
i
do
mane
to
say
a
word
against
the
kellys
mr
moylan
for
they
were
always
friends
of
mine
but
people
ca
be
allowed
to
make
a
dead
set
at
a
property
like
this
and
have
it
all
their
own
way
like
the
bull
in
the
i
know
there
has
been
an
agreement
made
and
that
in
the
eye
of
the
law
is
a
conspiracy
i
positively
know
that
an
agreement
has
been
made
to
induce
miss
lynch
to
become
martin
kelly
wife
and
i
know
the
parties
to
it
too
and
i
also
know
that
an
active
young
fellow
like
him
would
be
paying
an
agent
to
get
in
his
rents
and
i
thought
if
mr
lynch
was
willing
to
appoint
you
his
agent
as
well
as
his
sister
it
might
be
worth
your
while
to
lend
us
a
hand
to
settle
this
affair
without
forcing
us
to
stick
people
into
a
whom
neither
i
nor
mr
lynch
but
what
the
d
l
can
i
jist
hear
me
out
mr
moylan
you
see
if
they
once
knew
the
kellys
i
mane
that
you
would
lend
a
hand
to
this
piece
of
iniquity
which
piece
of
iniquity
mr
daly
for
i
entirely
bothered
ah
now
mr
moylan
none
of
your
fun
this
piece
of
iniquity
of
theirs
i
say
for
i
can
call
it
no
less
if
they
once
knew
that
you
would
help
they
be
obliged
to
drop
it
all
the
matter
never
have
to
go
into
court
at
all
and
you
jist
step
into
the
agency
fair
and
aisy
and
into
the
bargain
you
do
nothing
but
an
honest
work
the
old
man
broke
down
and
consented
to
go
agin
the
kellys
as
he
somewhat
ambiguously
styled
his
apostasy
provided
the
agency
was
absolutely
promised
to
him
and
he
went
away
with
the
understanding
that
he
was
to
come
on
the
following
day
and
meet
mr
lynch
at
two
punctual
to
the
time
of
his
appointment
moylan
was
there
and
was
kept
waiting
an
hour
in
daly
little
parlour
at
the
end
of
this
time
barry
came
in
having
invigorated
his
courage
and
spirits
with
a
couple
of
glasses
of
brandy
daly
had
been
for
some
time
on
the
for
him
for
he
wished
to
say
a
few
words
to
him
in
private
and
give
him
his
cue
before
he
took
him
into
the
room
where
moylan
was
sitting
this
could
not
well
be
done
in
the
office
for
it
was
crowded
it
would
i
think
astonish
a
london
attorney
in
respectable
practice
to
see
the
manner
in
which
his
brethren
towards
the
west
of
ireland
get
through
their
work
daly
office
was
open
to
all
the
world
the
front
door
of
the
house
of
which
he
rented
the
ground
floor
was
never
closed
except
at
night
nor
was
the
door
of
the
office
which
opened
immediately
into
the
hail
during
the
hour
that
moylan
was
waiting
in
the
parlour
daly
was
sitting
with
his
hat
on
upon
a
high
stool
with
his
feet
resting
on
a
small
counter
which
ran
across
the
room
smoking
a
pipe
a
boy
about
seventeen
years
of
age
daly
clerk
was
filling
up
numbers
of
those
abominable
formulas
of
legal
persecution
in
which
attorneys
deal
and
was
plying
his
trade
as
steadily
as
though
no
february
blasts
were
blowing
in
on
him
through
the
open
door
no
sounds
of
loud
and
boisterous
conversation
were
rattling
in
his
ears
the
dashing
manager
of
one
of
the
branch
banks
in
the
town
was
sitting
close
to
the
little
stove
and
raking
out
the
turf
ashes
with
the
office
rule
while
describing
a
that
had
taken
place
on
the
previous
sunday
at
blake
of
blakemount
he
had
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
was
searching
for
a
piece
of
turf
wherewith
to
light
it
a
little
fat
oily
shopkeeper
in
the
town
who
called
himself
a
woollen
merchant
was
standing
with
the
raised
leaf
of
the
counter
in
his
hand
roaring
with
laughter
at
the
manager
story
two
frieze
coated
farmers
outside
the
counter
were
stretching
across
it
and
whispering
very
audibly
to
daly
some
details
of
litigation
which
did
not
appear
very
much
to
interest
him
and
a
couple
of
idle
blackguards
were
leaning
against
the
wall
ready
to
obey
any
behest
of
the
which
might
enable
them
to
earn
a
sixpence
without
labour
and
listening
with
all
their
ears
to
the
different
interesting
topics
of
conversation
which
might
be
broached
in
the
inner
office
here
the
very
man
i
waiting
for
at
last
said
daly
when
from
his
position
on
the
stool
he
saw
through
the
two
open
doors
the
bloated
red
face
of
barry
lynch
approaching
and
giving
an
impulse
to
his
body
by
a
shove
against
the
wall
behind
him
he
raised
himself
on
to
the
counter
and
assisting
himself
by
a
pull
at
the
collar
of
the
frieze
coat
of
the
farmer
who
was
in
the
middle
of
his
story
jumped
to
the
ground
and
met
his
client
at
the
front
door
i
beg
your
pardon
mr
lynch
said
he
as
soon
as
he
had
shaken
hands
with
him
but
will
you
just
step
up
to
my
room
a
minute
for
i
want
to
spake
to
you
and
he
took
him
up
into
his
for
he
had
a
second
you
excuse
my
bringing
you
up
here
for
the
office
was
full
you
see
and
moylan
in
the
parlour
the
d
l
he
is
he
came
round
then
did
he
eh
daly
oh
i
had
a
terrible
hard
game
to
play
with
him
i
no
idea
be
so
tough
a
customer
or
make
such
a
good
fight
but
i
think
managed
him
there
was
a
regular
plan
then
eh
daly
just
as
i
said
it
was
a
regular
planned
scheme
among
them
wait
a
moment
and
you
know
all
about
it
at
least
as
much
as
i
know
myself
and
to
tell
the
truth
that
devilish
little
but
if
we
manage
to
break
off
the
match
and
get
your
sister
clane
out
of
the
inn
there
you
must
give
moylan
your
agency
at
any
rate
for
two
or
three
years
you
have
promised
that
but
i
have
though
we
can
do
nothing
without
it
it
was
only
when
i
hinted
that
that
the
old
sinner
came
round
but
what
the
deuce
is
it
he
to
do
for
us
after
all
he
to
allow
us
to
put
him
forward
as
a
bugbear
to
frighten
the
kellys
with
that
all
and
if
we
can
manage
that
that
enough
but
come
down
now
i
only
wanted
to
warn
you
that
if
you
think
the
agency
is
too
high
a
price
to
pay
for
the
man
services
whatever
they
may
be
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
dispense
with
them
well
answered
barry
as
he
followed
the
attorney
downstairs
i
ca
understand
what
you
about
but
i
suppose
you
must
be
right
and
they
went
into
the
little
parlour
where
moylan
was
sitting
moylan
and
barry
lynch
had
only
met
once
since
the
former
had
been
entrusted
to
receive
anty
rents
on
which
occasion
moylan
had
been
grossly
insulted
by
her
brother
barry
remembering
the
meeting
felt
very
awkward
at
the
idea
of
entering
into
amicable
conversation
with
him
and
crept
in
at
the
door
like
a
whipped
dog
moylan
was
too
old
to
feel
any
such
compunctions
and
consequently
made
what
he
intended
to
be
taken
as
a
very
complaisant
bow
to
his
future
patron
he
was
an
ugly
stumpy
man
about
fifty
with
a
blotched
face
straggling
sandy
hair
and
grey
shaggy
whiskers
he
wore
a
long
brown
great
coat
buttoned
up
to
his
chin
and
this
was
the
only
article
of
wearing
apparel
visible
upon
him
in
his
hands
he
twirled
a
shining
new
hat
as
soon
as
their
mutual
salutations
were
over
daly
commenced
his
business
there
is
no
doubt
in
the
world
mr
lynch
said
he
addressing
barry
that
a
most
unfair
attempt
has
been
made
by
this
family
to
get
possession
of
your
sister
property
a
most
shameful
attempt
which
the
law
will
no
doubt
recognise
as
a
misdemeanour
but
i
think
we
shall
be
able
to
stop
their
game
without
any
law
at
all
which
will
save
us
the
annoyance
of
putting
mr
moylan
here
and
other
respectable
witnesses
on
the
table
mr
moylan
says
that
very
soon
afther
your
father
will
was
made
known
now
mr
daly
shure
i
niver
said
a
word
in
life
at
all
about
the
will
said
moylan
interrupting
him
no
you
did
not
i
mane
very
soon
afther
you
got
the
agency
divil
a
word
i
said
about
the
agency
either
well
well
some
time
ago
he
says
that
some
time
ago
he
and
martin
kelly
were
talking
over
your
sister
affairs
i
believe
the
widow
was
there
too
ah
now
mr
daly
why
you
be
putting
them
words
into
my
mouth
sorrow
a
word
of
the
kind
i
iver
utthered
at
all
what
the
deuce
was
it
you
did
say
then
faix
i
do
know
that
i
said
much
at
all
did
you
say
mr
moylan
that
martin
kelly
was
talking
to
you
about
marrying
anty
some
six
weeks
ago
maybe
i
did
he
was
spaking
about
it
and
if
you
were
in
the
chair
now
before
a
jury
would
you
swear
that
there
was
a
schame
among
them
to
get
anty
lynch
married
to
martin
kelly
come
mr
moylan
that
all
we
want
to
know
if
you
ca
say
as
much
as
that
for
us
now
just
that
we
may
let
the
kellys
know
what
sort
of
evidence
we
could
bring
against
them
if
they
push
us
we
must
only
have
you
and
others
summoned
and
see
what
you
have
to
say
then
oh
i
say
the
truth
mr
daly
divil
a
less
and
i
do
as
much
as
that
now
but
i
thought
mr
lynch
was
wanting
to
say
something
about
the
property
not
a
word
then
i
to
say
about
it
said
barry
except
that
i
wo
let
that
robber
young
kelly
walk
off
with
it
as
long
as
there
law
in
the
land
mr
moylan
probably
meant
about
the
agency
observed
daly
barry
looked
considerably
puzzled
and
turned
to
the
attorney
for
assistance
he
manes
continued
daly
that
he
and
the
kellys
are
good
friends
and
it
would
be
any
convenience
to
him
just
to
say
anything
that
would
be
pleasing
to
them
unless
we
could
make
him
independent
of
them
is
that
about
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
mr
moylan
indepindent
of
the
kellys
is
it
mr
daly
faix
thin
i
teetotally
indepindent
of
them
this
minute
and
mane
to
continue
so
glory
be
to
god
oh
i
not
afeard
to
tell
the
thruth
agin
ere
a
kelly
in
galway
or
roscommon
and
av
that
was
all
i
do
see
why
i
need
have
come
here
this
day
when
i
called
upon
in
the
rigular
way
and
has
a
rigular
question
put
me
before
the
jury
either
at
sessions
or
you
find
i
not
be
bothered
for
an
answer
and
av
that
all
i
i
may
be
going
and
he
made
a
movement
towards
the
door
just
as
you
please
mr
moylan
said
daly
and
you
may
be
sure
that
you
not
be
long
without
an
opportunity
of
showing
how
free
you
are
with
your
answers
but
as
a
friend
i
tell
you
you
be
wrong
to
lave
this
room
till
you
had
a
little
more
talk
with
mr
lynch
and
myself
i
believe
i
mentioned
to
you
mr
lynch
was
looking
out
for
someone
to
act
as
agent
over
his
portion
of
the
dunmore
property
barry
looked
as
black
as
thunder
but
he
said
nothing
you
war
mr
daly
av
i
could
accommodate
mr
lynch
i
shure
i
be
happy
to
undhertake
the
business
i
believe
mr
lynch
said
daly
turning
to
the
other
i
may
go
so
far
as
to
promise
mr
moylan
the
agency
of
the
whole
property
provided
miss
lynch
is
induced
to
quit
the
house
of
the
kellys
of
course
mr
moylan
you
can
see
that
as
long
as
miss
lynch
is
in
a
position
of
unfortunate
hostility
to
her
brother
the
same
agent
could
not
act
for
both
but
i
think
my
client
is
inclined
to
put
his
property
under
your
management
providing
his
sister
returns
to
her
own
home
i
believe
stating
your
wishes
mr
lynch
manage
it
your
own
way
said
barry
for
i
do
see
what
doing
if
this
man
can
do
anything
for
me
why
i
suppose
i
must
pay
him
for
it
and
if
so
your
plan
as
good
a
way
of
paying
him
as
another
the
attorney
raised
his
hat
with
his
hand
and
scratched
his
head
he
was
afraid
that
moylan
would
have
again
gone
off
in
a
pet
at
brutality
but
the
old
man
sat
quite
quiet
he
would
have
much
minded
what
was
said
to
him
as
long
as
he
secured
the
agency
you
see
mr
moylan
continued
daly
you
can
have
the
agency
five
per
cent
upon
the
rents
is
what
my
client
no
daly
five
per
cent
i
shot
if
i
do
exclaimed
barry
i
gething
pounds
per
annum
from
miss
anty
for
her
half
and
i
would
think
of
collecting
the
other
for
less
declared
moylan
and
then
a
long
battle
followed
on
this
point
which
it
required
all
daly
tact
and
perseverance
to
adjust
the
old
man
was
pertinacious
and
many
whispers
had
to
be
made
into
barry
ear
before
the
matter
could
be
settled
it
was
however
at
last
agreed
that
notice
was
to
be
served
on
the
kellys
of
barry
lynch
determination
to
indict
them
for
a
conspiracy
that
daly
was
to
see
the
widow
martin
and
if
possible
anty
and
tell
them
all
that
moylan
was
prepared
to
prove
that
such
a
conspiracy
had
been
formed
care
was
also
to
be
taken
that
copies
of
the
notices
so
served
should
be
placed
in
anty
hands
moylan
in
the
meantime
agreed
to
keep
out
of
the
way
and
undertook
should
he
be
unfortunate
enough
to
encounter
any
of
the
family
of
the
kellys
to
brave
the
matter
out
by
declaring
that
av
he
war
brought
before
the
judge
and
jury
he
could
do
more
than
tell
the
blessed
thruth
and
why
not
in
reward
for
this
he
was
to
be
appointed
agent
over
the
entire
property
the
moment
that
miss
lynch
left
the
inn
at
which
time
he
was
to
receive
a
document
signed
by
barry
undertaking
to
retain
him
in
the
agency
for
four
years
certain
or
else
to
pay
him
a
hundred
pounds
when
it
was
taken
from
him
these
terms
having
been
mutually
agreed
to
and
barry
having
with
many
oaths
declared
that
he
was
a
most
shamefully
man
the
three
separated
moylan
skulked
off
to
one
of
his
haunts
in
the
town
barry
went
to
the
bank
to
endeavour
to
get
a
bill
discounted
and
daly
returned
to
his
office
to
prepare
the
notices
for
the
unfortunate
widow
and
her
son
footnote
bill
discounted
a
common
way
for
young
men
to
borrow
money
in
nineteenth
century
britain
was
to
sign
a
promissory
note
an
often
called
a
bill
to
repay
the
loan
at
a
specified
time
the
lender
gave
the
borrower
less
than
the
face
value
of
the
note
that
is
he
discounted
the
note
the
difference
being
the
interest
sometimes
these
notes
were
by
a
third
party
who
became
responsible
for
repaying
the
loan
if
the
borrower
defaulted
this
is
one
of
the
major
themes
in
trollope
later
book
trollope
himself
was
quite
familiar
with
methods
of
borrowing
having
gotten
into
debt
in
his
youth
xix
mr
daly
visits
the
dunmore
inn
daly
let
no
grass
grow
under
his
feet
for
early
on
the
following
morning
he
hired
a
car
and
proceeded
to
dunmore
with
the
notices
in
his
pocket
his
feelings
were
not
very
comfortable
on
his
journey
for
he
knew
that
he
was
going
on
a
bad
errand
and
he
was
not
naturally
either
a
heartless
or
an
unscrupulous
man
considering
that
he
was
a
provincial
attorney
but
he
was
young
in
business
and
poor
and
he
could
not
afford
to
give
up
a
client
he
endeavoured
to
persuade
himself
that
it
certainly
was
a
wrong
thing
for
martin
kelly
to
marry
such
a
woman
as
anty
lynch
and
that
barry
had
some
show
of
justice
on
his
side
but
he
could
not
succeed
he
knew
that
martin
was
a
frank
honourable
fellow
and
that
a
marriage
with
him
would
be
the
very
thing
most
likely
to
make
anty
happy
and
he
was
certain
moreover
that
however
anxious
martin
might
naturally
be
to
secure
the
fortune
he
would
take
no
illegal
or
even
unfair
steps
to
do
so
he
felt
that
his
client
was
a
ruffian
of
the
deepest
die
that
his
sole
object
was
to
rob
his
sister
and
that
he
had
no
case
which
it
would
be
possible
even
to
bring
before
a
jury
his
intention
now
was
merely
to
work
upon
the
timidity
and
ignorance
of
anty
and
the
other
females
and
to
frighten
them
with
a
bugbear
in
the
shape
of
a
criminal
indictment
and
daly
felt
that
the
work
he
was
about
was
very
very
dirty
work
two
or
three
times
on
the
road
he
had
all
but
made
up
his
mind
to
tear
the
letters
he
had
in
his
pocket
and
to
drive
at
once
to
dunmore
house
and
tell
barry
lynch
that
he
would
do
nothing
further
in
the
case
and
he
would
have
done
so
had
he
not
reflected
that
he
had
gone
so
far
with
moylan
that
he
could
not
recede
without
leaving
it
in
the
old
rogue
power
to
make
the
whole
matter
public
as
he
drove
down
the
street
of
dunmore
he
endeavoured
to
quiet
his
conscience
by
reflecting
that
he
might
still
do
much
to
guard
anty
from
the
ill
effects
of
her
brother
rapacity
and
that
at
any
rate
he
would
not
see
her
property
taken
from
her
though
she
might
be
frightened
out
of
her
matrimonial
speculation
he
wanted
to
see
the
widow
martin
and
anty
and
if
possible
to
see
them
at
first
separately
and
fortune
so
far
favoured
him
that
as
he
got
off
the
car
he
saw
our
hero
standing
at
the
inn
door
ah
mr
daly
said
he
coming
up
to
the
car
and
shaking
hands
with
the
attorney
for
daly
put
out
his
hand
to
him
how
are
you
again
i
suppose
you
going
up
to
the
house
they
say
you
barry
right
hand
man
now
were
you
coming
into
the
inn
why
i
will
step
in
just
this
minute
but
i
a
word
i
want
to
spake
to
you
first
to
me
said
martin
yes
to
you
martin
kelly
is
that
quare
and
then
he
gave
directions
to
the
driver
to
put
up
the
horse
and
bring
the
car
round
again
in
an
hour
time
d
you
remember
my
telling
you
the
day
we
came
into
dunmore
on
the
car
together
that
i
was
going
up
to
the
house
faith
i
do
well
it
not
so
long
since
and
do
you
mind
my
telling
you
i
did
know
from
adam
what
it
was
for
that
barry
lynch
was
sending
for
me
and
i
remember
that
too
and
that
i
tould
you
that
when
i
did
know
i
should
tell
you
begad
you
did
mr
daly
thim
very
words
why
then
martin
i
tould
you
what
was
thrue
for
i
come
all
the
way
from
tuam
this
minute
to
tell
you
all
about
it
martin
turned
very
red
for
he
rightly
conceived
that
when
an
attorney
came
all
the
way
from
tuam
to
talk
to
him
the
tidings
were
not
likely
to
be
agreeable
and
is
it
about
barry
lynch
business
it
is
then
it
schames
there
divil
a
doubt
of
that
it
is
schames
as
you
say
martin
said
daly
slapping
him
on
the
shoulder
fine
schames
no
less
than
a
wife
with
four
hundred
would
that
be
a
fine
schame
it
would
mr
daly
av
the
wife
and
the
fortune
were
honestly
come
by
and
is
it
a
hundred
pities
that
i
must
come
and
upset
such
a
pretty
schame
as
that
but
for
all
that
it
thrue
i
sorry
for
you
martin
but
you
must
give
up
anty
lynch
give
her
up
is
it
faith
i
have
got
her
to
give
up
worse
luck
nor
never
will
martin
and
that
worse
luck
again
well
mr
daly
av
that
all
you
come
to
say
you
might
have
saved
yourself
miss
lynch
is
nothing
to
me
mind
how
should
she
be
but
av
she
war
neither
barry
lynch
who
as
big
a
rogue
as
there
is
from
this
to
hisself
and
back
again
nor
you
who
i
take
it
rogue
enough
to
do
barry
work
would
put
me
off
it
well
martin
thank
for
the
compliment
but
now
you
know
what
i
come
about
and
there
no
joke
in
it
of
course
i
do
want
you
to
tell
me
anything
of
your
plans
but
as
mr
lynch
lawyer
i
must
tell
you
so
much
as
this
of
his
that
if
his
sister
does
lave
the
inn
and
honestly
assure
him
that
she
give
up
her
intention
of
marrying
you
he
determined
to
take
proceedings
he
then
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
bringing
out
the
two
notices
handed
to
martin
the
one
addressed
to
him
read
that
and
it
give
you
an
idea
what
afther
and
when
i
tell
you
that
moylan
owns
and
will
swear
to
it
too
that
he
was
present
when
all
the
plans
were
made
you
see
that
not
going
to
sea
without
wind
in
our
sails
well
i
shot
av
i
know
the
laist
in
the
world
what
all
this
is
about
said
martin
as
he
stood
in
the
street
reading
over
the
letter
well
that
do
mr
daly
go
on
away
from
her
home
that
good
when
the
blackguard
nearly
knocked
the
life
out
of
her
and
mother
brought
her
down
here
from
downright
charity
and
to
prevent
murdher
intellects
well
mr
daly
i
did
expect
this
kind
of
thing
from
you
begorra
i
thought
you
were
above
this
wake
intellects
faith
they
a
dale
too
sthrong
and
too
good
and
too
wide
awake
too
for
barry
to
get
the
betther
of
her
that
way
not
that
i
in
the
laist
in
life
surprised
at
anything
he
do
but
i
thought
that
you
mr
daly
would
put
your
hands
to
such
work
as
that
daly
felt
the
rebuke
and
felt
it
strongly
too
but
now
that
he
was
embarked
in
the
business
he
must
put
the
best
face
he
could
upon
it
still
it
was
a
moment
or
two
before
he
could
answer
the
young
farmer
why
he
said
why
did
you
put
your
hands
to
such
a
dirty
job
as
this
martin
you
were
doing
well
and
not
in
want
and
how
could
you
let
anyone
persuade
you
to
go
and
sell
yourself
to
an
ugly
ould
maid
for
a
few
hundred
pounds
do
you
know
that
if
you
were
married
to
her
this
minute
you
have
a
lawsuit
that
go
near
to
ruin
you
before
you
could
get
possession
of
the
property
av
i
in
want
of
legal
advice
mr
daly
which
thank
god
i
not
nor
likely
to
be
but
av
i
war
it
not
from
barry
lynch
attorney
i
be
looking
for
it
i
be
sorry
to
see
you
in
want
of
it
martin
but
if
you
mane
to
keep
out
of
the
worst
kind
of
law
you
better
have
done
with
anty
lynch
i
a
dale
sooner
be
drawing
up
a
marriage
settlement
between
you
and
some
pretty
girl
with
five
or
six
hundred
pound
fortune
than
i
be
exposing
to
the
counthry
such
a
mane
trick
as
this
you
now
afther
of
seducing
a
poor
ould
maid
like
anty
lynch
into
a
disgraceful
marriage
look
here
mr
daly
said
the
other
you
hired
yourself
out
to
barry
lynch
and
you
must
do
his
work
i
suppose
whether
it
dirthy
or
clane
and
you
know
yourself
as
well
as
i
can
tell
you
which
likely
to
be
that
my
concern
lave
that
to
me
you
quite
enough
to
do
to
mind
yourself
but
av
he
nothing
betther
for
you
to
do
than
to
send
you
here
and
calling
folks
out
of
their
name
he
must
have
a
sight
more
money
to
spare
than
i
give
him
credit
for
and
you
must
be
a
dale
worse
off
than
your
neighbours
thought
you
to
do
it
for
him
that
do
said
mr
daly
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
inn
only
remember
mr
kelly
you
now
received
notice
of
the
steps
which
my
client
feels
himself
called
upon
to
take
martin
turned
to
go
away
but
then
reflecting
that
it
would
be
as
well
not
to
leave
the
women
by
themselves
in
the
power
of
the
enemy
he
also
waited
at
the
door
till
it
was
opened
by
katty
is
miss
lynch
within
asked
daly
go
round
to
the
shop
katty
said
martin
and
tell
mother
to
come
to
the
door
there
a
gentleman
wanting
her
it
was
miss
lynch
i
asked
for
said
daly
still
looking
to
the
girl
for
an
answer
do
as
i
bid
you
you
born
ideot
and
do
stand
gaping
there
shouted
martin
to
the
girl
who
immediately
ran
off
towards
the
shop
i
might
as
well
warn
you
mr
kelly
that
if
miss
lynch
is
denied
to
me
the
fact
of
her
being
so
denied
will
be
a
very
sthrong
proof
against
you
and
your
family
in
fact
it
amounts
to
an
illegal
detention
of
her
person
in
the
eye
of
the
law
daly
said
this
in
a
very
low
voice
almost
a
whisper
faith
the
law
must
have
quare
eyes
av
it
makes
anything
wrong
with
a
young
lady
being
asked
the
question
whether
or
no
she
wishes
to
see
an
attorney
at
eleven
in
the
morning
an
attorney
whispered
meg
to
jane
and
anty
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
heaven
and
said
poor
anty
shaking
and
shivering
going
to
be

young
daly
said
jane
stretching
forward
and
peeping
clown
the
stairs
i
can
see
the
curl
of
his
whiskers
by
this
time
the
news
had
reached
mrs
kelly
in

shop
that
a
sthrange
gentleman

axing
for
miss
anty
but
that
she

the
widow
dropped
her
tobacco
knife
flung
off
her
dirty
apron
and
having
summoned
jane
and
meg
to
attend
to
the
mercantile
affairs
of
the
establishment
turned
into
the
inn
and
met
mr
daly
and
her
son
still
standing
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
the
widow
curtsied
ceremoniously
and
wished
daly
good

he
was
equally
civil
in
his
salutation
mr
daly

to

herself
on
a
chair
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
her
hands
folded
over
each
other
in
her
lap
as
if
she
was
preparing
to

questions
from
that
time
to
a
very
late
hour
in
the
evening
and
now
mr
daly
av

respect
to

daly
but
i
can
assure
you
you
will
put

in
a
very
awkward
position
if
you
refuse
to
allow
me
to
see
miss
lynch
ah

martin
do

a
word
to

just
as
she
chooses
what
she
afeard
of
that
she
should
hear
what
anyone
has
to
say
to
her
the
widow
seemed
to
be
in
great
doubt
and
perplexity
and
continued
whispering
with
martin
for
some
time
during
which
daly
remained
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
at
length
martin
said
av
got
another
of
them
notices
to
give
my
mother
mr
daly
why
do
you
do
it
why
to
tell
you
the
thruth
answered
the
attorney
i
do
want
to
throuble
your
mother
unless
it
absolutely
necessary
and
although
i
have
the
notice
ready
in
my
pocket
if
i
could
see
miss
lynch
i
might
be
spared
the
disagreeable
job
of
serving
it
on
her
the
holy
virgin
save
us
said
the
widow
an
what
notice
is
it
at
all
you
going
to
serve
on
a
poor
lone
woman
like
me
be
said
by
me
mother
and
fetch
anty
in
here
mr
daly
wo
expect
i
suppose
but
what
you
should
stay
and
hear
what
it
is
he
has
to
say
both
you
and
your
mother
are
welcome
to
hear
all
that
i
have
to
say
to
the
lady
said
daly
for
he
felt
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
see
anty
alone
the
widow
unwillingly
got
up
to
fetch
her
guest
when
she
got
to
the
door
she
turned
round
and
said
and
is
there
a
notice
as
you
calls
it
to
be
sarved
on
miss
lynch
not
a
line
mrs
kelly
not
a
line
on
my
honour
i
only
want
her
to
hear
a
few
words
that
i
commissioned
by
her
brother
to
say
to
her
and
you
not
going
to
give
her
any
paper
nor
nothing
of
that
sort
at
all
not
a
word
mrs
kelly
ah
mother
said
martin
mr
daly
could
hurt
her
av
he
war
wishing
and
he
not
go
and
bring
her
in
the
widow
went
out
and
in
a
few
minutes
returned
bringing
anty
with
her
trembling
from
head
to
foot
the
poor
young
woman
had
not
exactly
heard
what
had
passed
between
the
attorney
and
the
mother
and
her
son
but
she
knew
very
well
that
his
visit
had
reference
to
her
and
that
it
was
in
some
way
connected
with
her
brother
she
had
therefore
been
in
a
great
state
of
alarm
since
meg
and
jane
had
left
her
alone
when
mrs
kelly
came
into
the
little
room
where
she
was
sitting
and
told
her
that
mr
daly
had
come
to
dunmore
on
purpose
to
see
her
her
first
impulse
was
to
declare
that
she
would
go
to
him
and
had
she
done
so
the
widow
would
not
have
pressed
her
but
she
hesitated
for
she
did
like
to
refuse
to
do
anything
which
her
friend
asked
her
and
when
mrs
kelly
said
martin
says
as
how
the
man
ca
hurt
you
anty
so
you
betther
jist
hear
what
it
is
he
has
to
say
she
felt
that
she
had
no
loophole
of
escape
and
got
up
to
comply
but
mind
anty
whispered
the
cautious
widow
as
her
hand
was
on
the
parlour
door
becase
this
daly
is
wanting
to
speak
to
you
that
no
rason
you
should
be
wanting
to
spake
to
him
so
if
you
be
said
by
me
you
jist
hould
your
tongue
and
let
him
say
on
fully
determined
to
comply
with
this
prudent
advice
anty
followed
the
old
woman
and
curtseying
at
daly
without
looking
at
him
sat
herself
down
in
the
middle
of
the
old
sofa
with
her
hands
crossed
before
her
anty
said
martin
making
great
haste
to
speak
before
daly
could
commence
and
then
checking
himself
as
he
remembered
that
he
have
ventured
on
the
familiarity
of
calling
her
by
her
christian
name
in
daly
presence
miss
lynch
i
mane
as
mr
daly
here
has
come
all
the
way
from
tuam
on
purpose
to
spake
to
you
it
would
perhaps
be
manners
in
you
to
let
him
go
back
without
hearing
him
but
remember
whatever
your
brother
says
or
whatever
mr
daly
says
for
him
and
all
one
you
still
your
own
mistress
free
to
act
and
to
spake
to
come
and
to
go
and
that
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
can
hurt
you
or
mother
or
me
nor
anybody
belonging
to
us
god
knows
said
daly
i
want
to
have
no
hand
in
hurting
any
of
you
but
to
tell
the
truth
martin
it
would
be
well
for
miss
lynch
to
have
a
better
adviser
than
you
or
she
may
get
herself
and
what
think
more
of
she
get
her
friends
maning
you
mrs
kelly

duty
continued
daly
rather
bothered
by
the
manner
in
which
he
had
to
make
his
communication
and
it
is
a
duty
which
he
is
determined
to
go
through
with
duty
said
the
widow
with
a
twist
of
her
nose
and
giving
almost
a
whistle
through
her
lips
in
a
manner
which
very
plainly
declared
the
contempt
she
felt
for
barry
ideas
of
duty
with
this
object
continued
daly
i
have
already
handed
to
martin
kelly
a
notice
of
what
your
brother
means
to
do
and
i
have
another
notice
prepared
in
my
pocket
for
his

the
next
step

be
to
swear
the
informations
before
a
magistrate
and
get
the
committals
made
out
mrs
kelly
and
her
son
will
then
have
to
give
bail
for
their
appearance
at
the
assizes
and
so
we
can
said
the
widow
betther
bail
than
a
lynch
or
daly
not
but
what
the
dalys
is
respictable
betther
bail
any
way
than
a
lynch
in
galway
could
show
either
for
sessions
or
by

or
by

winter
or
summer

take

mrs

said

muttered
the
widow
faix
i
his
chief
failing
at

for

dhrink

home
and
give
him
your
promise
that
you
will
never

martin
kelly
anty
blushed
deep
crimson
over
her
whole
face
at
the
mention
of
her
contemplated
marriage
and
to
tell
the
truth
so
did
martin
here
is
the
notice
said

taking
the
paper

that
you
be
guided
by
your
brother
on
this
subject
i
burn
the

is
concerned
your
brother
will
not
in
the
least
interfere
with

in
the
management
of

matter
whatever
effect
daly
threats
may
have
had
on
the
widow
and
her
son
they
told
strongly
upon
anty
for
she
sat
now
the
picture
of
misery
and
indecision
at
last
she
said
oh
lord

me
what

i
to

mrs
kelly

said
martin
why

convent

minute

said
martin
who
quite
like
his
mistress
allusion
to
a
convent
you
do
suppose

a
word
of
thruth
in
all
this
long
story
of
mr
daly
he
knows
and
i
say
it
out
to

out
of

that
barry
may
have
his
will
on
you
again
and
god
forgive
him
his
errand
here
this
day
said
the
widow
for
it
was
a
very
bad
one
if
you
will
allow
me
to
offer
you
my
advice
miss
lynch
said
daly
you
will
put
yourself
at
any
rate
for
a
time
under
your
protection
she
wo
do
no
sich
thing
said
the
widow
what
to
be
locked
into
the
parlour
agin
and
be
nigh
murdhered
holy
father
oh
no
said
anty
at
last
shuddering
in
horror
at
the
remembrance
of
the
last
night
she
passed
in
dunmore
house
i
can
not
go
back
to
live
with
him
but
i
do
anything
else
av
he
only
lave
me
and
my
kind
kind
friends
in
pace
and
quiet
indeed
and
you
wo
anty
said
the
widow
you
do
nothing
for
him
your
frinds
that
av
you
mane
the
kellys
is
very
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
if
your
brother
miss
lynch
will
lave
dunmore
house
altogether
and
let
you
have
it
to
yourself
will
you
go
and
live
there
and
give
him
the
promise
not
to
marry
martin
kelly
indeed
an
she
wo
said
the
widow
she
give
no
promise
of
the
kind
promise
indeed
what
for
should
she
promise
barry
lynch
whom
she
will
marry
or
whom
she
wo
raily
mrs
kelly
i
think
you
might
let
miss
lynch
answer
for
herself
i
would
for
all
the
world
thin
go
to
live
at
dunmore
house
said
anty
and
you
are
determined
to
stay
in
this
inn
here
in
course
she
is
that
till
she
a
snug
house
of
her
own
said
the
widow
ah
mother
said
martin
what
for
will
you
be
talking
and
you
determined
repeated
daly
to
stay
here
i
am
faltered
anty
then
i
have
nothing
further
to
do
than
to
hand
you
this
mrs
kelly
and
he
offered
the
notice
to
the
widow
but
she
refused
to
touch
it
and
he
consequently
put
it
down
on
the
table
but
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
you
miss
lynch
that
the
gentry
of
this
counthry
before
whom
you
will
have
to
appear
will
express
very
great
indignation
at
your
conduct
in
persevering
in
placing
poor
people
like
the
kellys
in
so
dreadful
a
predicament
by
your
wilful
and
disgraceful
obstinacy
poor
anty
burst
into
tears
she
had
been
for
some
time
past
trying
to
restrain
herself
but
daly
last
speech
and
the
horrible
idea
of
the
gentry
of
the
country
browbeating
and
frowning
at
her
completely
upset
her
and
she
hid
her
face
on
the
arm
of
the
sofa
and
sobbed
aloud
poor
people
like
the
kellys
shouted
the
widow
now
for
the
first
time
really
angry
with
daly
not
so
poor
mr
daly
as
to
do
dirthy
work
for
anyone
i
wish
i
could
say
as
much
this
day
for
your
son
poor
people
indeed
i
suppose
now
you
would
call
barry
lynch
one
of
your
poor
people
but
in
my
mind
he
the
poorest
crature
living
this
day
in
county
galway
av
you
done
now
mr
daly
you
my
lave
to
be
walking
and
the
less
you
let
the
poor
kellys
see
of
you
from
this
time
out
the
betther
when
anty
sobs
commenced
martin
had
gone
over
to
her
to
comfort
her
ah
anty
dear
he
whispered
to
her
shure
you
not
be
minding
what
such
a
fellow
as
he
be
saying
to
you
shure
he
jist

by
barry

thry
and
frighten
you
but
it
was
of
no
avail
daly
had
succeeded
at
any
rate
in
making
her
miserable
and
it
was
past
the
power
of
martin
eloquence
to
undo
what
the
attorney
had
done
well

daly

of

attorney

but
they
did
not

able

the
widow

all
these
throubles
on

and
bear
it
all
than

into
law
and
sorrow
and
expense
only
i
could
find
the
words
in
my
throat
to
say

i
tould
the
man
that
i
gone
back
at
once
i
wish
i
had
indeed
mrs
kelly
i
wish
i
had
why
anty
said
martin
you
a
fool
enough
to
believe
what
been
saying
shure
all
he
afther
is
to
frighthen
you
out
of
this
never
fear
barry
ca
hurt
us
a
halfporth
though
no
doubt
willing
enough
av
he
had
the
way
i
wish
i
was
in
a
convent
this
moment
said
anty
oh
i
wish
done
as
father
asked
me
long
since
av
the
walls
of
a
convent
was
around
me
i
niver
know
what
throubles
was
no
more
you
sha
now
said
martin
who
to
hurt
you
come
anty
look
up
there
nothing
in
all
this
to
vex
you
but
neither
son
nor
mother
were
able
to
soothe
the
poor
young
woman
the
very
presence
of
an
attorney
was
awful
to
her
and
all
the
jargon
which
daly
had
used
of
juries
judges
trials
and
notices
had
sounded
terribly
in
her
ears
the
very
names
of
such
things
were
to
her
terrible
realities
and
she
could
bring
herself
to
believe
that
her
brother
would
threaten
to
make
use
of
such
horrible
engines
of
persecution
without
having
the
power
to
bring
them
into
action
then
visions
of
the
lunatic
asylum
into
which
he
had
declared
that
he
would
throw
her
flitted
across
her
and
made
her
whole
body
shiver
and
shake
and
again
she
remembered
the
horrid
glare
of
his
eye
the
hot
breath
and
the
frightful
form
of
his
visage
on
the
night
when
he
almost
told
her
that
he
would
murder
her
poor
anty
had
at
no
time
high
or
enduring
spirits
but
such
as
she
had
were
now
completely
quelled
a
dreadful
feeling
of
coming
evil
a
foreboding
of
misery
such
as
will
sometimes
overwhelm
stronger
minds
than
anty
seemed
to
stifle
her
and
she
continued
sobbing
till
she
fell
into
hysterics
when
meg
and
jane
were
summoned
to
her
assistance
they
sat
with
her
for
above
an
hour
doing
all
that
kindness
and
affection
could
suggest
but
after
a
time
anty
told
them
that
she
had
a
cold
sick
feeling
within
herself
that
she
felt
weak
and
ill
and
that
she
sooner
go
to
bed
to
bed
they
accordingly
took
her
and
sally
brought
her
tea
and
katty
lighted
a
fire
in
her
room
and
jane
read
to
her
an
edifying
article
from
the
lives
of
the
saints
and
meg
argued
with
her
as
to
the
folly
of
being
frightened
but
it
was
all
of
no
avail
before
night
anty
was
really
ill
the
next
morning
the
widow
was
obliged
to
own
to
herself
that
such
was
the
case
in
the
afternoon
doctor
colligan
was
called
in
and
it
was
many
many
weeks
before
anty
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
attorney
visit
xx
very
liberal
when
the
widow
left
the
parlour
after
having
placed
her
guest
in
the
charge
of
her
daughters
she
summoned
her
son
to
follow
her
down
stairs
and
was
very
careful
not
to
leave
behind
her
the
notice
which
daly
had
placed
on
the
table
as
soon
as
she
found
herself
behind
the
shutter
of
her
little
desk
which
stood
in
the
she
commenced
very
eagerly
spelling
it
over
the
purport
of
the
notice
was
to
inform
her
that
barry
lynch
intended
immediately
to
apply
to
the
magistrates
to
commit
her
and
her
son
for
conspiring
together
to
inveigle
anty
into
a
marriage
and
that
the
fact
of
their
having
done
so
would
be
proved
by
mr
moylan
who
was
prepared
to
swear
that
he
had
been
present
when
the
plan
had
been
arranged
between
them
the
reader
is
aware
that
whatever
show
of
truth
there
might
be
for
this
accusation
as
far
as
martin
and
moylan
himself
were
concerned
the
widow
at
any
rate
was
innocent
and
he
can
conceive
the
good
indignation
at
the
idea
of
her
own
connection
moylan
having
been
seduced
over
to
the
enemy
though
she
had
put
on
a
bold
front
against
daly
and
though
she
did
not
quite
believe
that
barry
was
in
earnest
in
taking
proceedings
against
her
still
her
heart
failed
her
as
she
read
the
legal
technicalities
of
the
papers
she
held
in
her
hand
and
turned
to
her
son
for
counsel
in
considerable
tribulation
but
there
must
be
something
in
it
i
tell
you
said
she
though
barry
lynch
and
that
limb
o
the
divil
young
daly
stick
at
nothin
in
the
way
of
lies
and
desait
they
niver
go
to
say
all
this
about
moylan
unless
he
agree
to
do
their
bidding
that
like
enough
mother
i
dare
say
moylan
has
been
talked
over
bought
over
rather
for
he
not
one
of
them
as
do
mischief
for
nothin
and
does
the
ould
robber
mane
to
say
that
i
as
i
live
i
niver
as
much
as
mentioned
anty
name
to
moylan
except
jist
about
the
agency
i
shure
you
did
mother
and
what
is
it
then
he
has
to
say
agin
us
jist
lies
that
av
he
were
called
on
to
say
anything
but
he
niver
will
be
this
is
all
one
of
barry
schames
to
frighten
you
and
get
anty
turned
out
of
the
inn
thin
master
barry
does
know
the
widdy
kelly
i
can
tell
him
that
for
when
i
puts
my
hand
to
a
thing
i
mane
to
pull
through
wid
it
but
tell
me
all
this
be
costing
money
wo
it
attorneys
do
bring
thim
sort
of
things
about
for
nothing
and
she
gave
a
most
contemptuous
twist
to
the
notice
oh
barry
must
pay
for
that
i
doubt
that
martin
he
not
fond
of
paying
the
mane
dirthy
blackguard

would
let
any
one
come
nigh
her
well
martin
you
see
we
have
to
pay
for
it
this
comes
of
meddling
with
other
folks
i
wonder
how
i
was
iver
fool
enough
to
have
fitched
her
down
here
good
could
come
of
daling
with
such
people
as

lynch
but
you

murdhered
she
nothin
to

and
i
do
know
as
she
iver
like
to

in
all
this
throuble
along
of
you
and
you
should
lave

the
dark

to
moylan
about

whole
thruth
as
i
tould
it
all
before
to
mister
frank
that
is
lord
ballindine
up
in
dublin
and
as
i
would
mind
telling
it
this
minute
to

or
any
one
else
in
the
three
counties
when
moylan
got
the
agency
he
come
out
to
me
at
toneroe
and
afther
talking
a
bit
about
anty
and
her
fortune
he
let
on
as
how
it
would
be
a
bright
spec
for
me
to
marry
her
and
i
wo
deny
that
it
was
he
as
first
put
it
into
my
head
well
thin
he
had
schames
of
his
own
about
keeping
the
agency
and
getting
a
nice
thing
out
of
the
property
himself
for
putting
anty
in
my
way
but
i
tould
him
downright
i
did
know
anything
about
that
and
that
iver
i
did
anything
in
the
matter
it
would
be
all
fair
and
above
board
and
that
was
all
the
conspiracy
i
and
moylan
had
and
enough
too
martin
said
the
widow
you
find
it
quite
enough
to
get
us
into
throuble
and
why
would
you
tell
me
what
was
going
on
between
you
there
was
nothing
going
on
between
us
i
say
there
was
and
to
go
and
invaigle
me
into
your
schames
without
knowing
a
word
about
it
it
was
a
murdhering
shame
of
you
and
av
i
do
have
to
pay
for
it
i
never
forgive
you
that
right
mother
quarrel
with
me
about
it
do
it
was
i
made
you
bring
anty
down
here
was
it
when
i
was
up
in
dublin
all
the
time
but
to
go
and
put
yourself
in
the
power
of
sich
a
fellow
as
moylan
i
did
think
you
were
so
soft
ah
bother
mother
who
put
themselves
in
the
power
of
moylan
i
moyle
him
and
spoil
him
too
the
false
blackguard
to
turn
agin
the
family
them
as
has
made
him
i
wondher
what
he
to
get
for
swearing
agin
us
and
then
after
a
pause
she
added
in
a
most
pathetic
voice
oh
martin
to
think
of
being
dragged
away
to
galway
before
the
whole
counthry
to
be
made
a
conspirather
of
i
that
always
paid
my
way
before
and
behind
though
only
a
poor
widdy
who
to
mind
the
shop
i
wondher
i
shure
meg
not
able
and
there
be
be
jist
nigh
her
time
and
wo
be
able
to
come
martin
you
been
and
ruined
me
with
your
plots
and
your
marriages
what
did
you
want
with
a
wife
i
wondher
and
you
so
well
off
and
mrs
kelly
began
wiping
her
eyes
for
she
was
affected
to
tears
at
the
prospect
of
her
coming
misery
av
you
take
it
so
to
heart
mother
you
betther
give
anty
a
hint
to
be
out
of
this
you
heard
daly
tell
her
that
was
all
barry
wanted
martin
knew
his
mother
tolerably
well
or
he
would
not
have
made
this
proposition
he
understood
what
the
real
extent
of
her
sorrow
was
and
how
much
of
her
lamentation
he
was
to
attribute
to
her
laudable
wish
to
appear
a
martyr
to
the
wishes
and
pleasures
of
her
children
turn
her
out
replied
she
no
niver
and
i
did
think
i
heard
you
asking
me
to
i
did
ask
you
mother
only
anything
be
betther
than
downright
ruin
i
would
demane
myself
to
barry
so
much
as
to
wish
her
out
of
this
now
she
here
but
it
was
along
of
you
she
came
here
and
av
i
to
pay
for
all
this
lawyer
work
you
ought
to
see
me
at
a
loss
shure
i
do
know
where
your
sisthers
is
to
look
for
a
pound
or
two
when
i
gone
av
things
goes
on
this
way
and
again
the
widow
whimpered
do
let
that
throuble
you
mother
av
there
anything
to
pay
i
wo
let
it
come
upon
you
any
way
but
i
tell
you
there
be
nothing
more
about
it
mrs
kelly
was
somewhat
quieted
by
her
son
guarantee
and
muttering
that
she
could
afford
to
be
wasting
her
mornings
in
that
way
diligently
commenced
weighing
out
innumerable
of
brown
sugar
and
martin
went
about
his
own
business
daly
left
the
inn
after
his
interview
with
anty
and
the
kellys
in
anything
but
a
pleasant
frame
of
mind
in
the
first
place
he
knew
that
he
had
been
signally
unsuccessful
and
that
his
want
of
success
had
been
mainly
attributable
to
his
having
failed
to
see
anty
alone
and
in
the
next
place
he
felt
more
than
ever
disgusted
with
his
client
he
began
to
reflect
for
the
first
time
that
he
might
and
probably
would
irretrievably
injure
his
character
by
undertaking
as
martin
truly
called
it
such
a
very
low
line
of
business
that
if
the
matter
were
persevered
in
every
one
in
connaught
would
be
sure
to
hear
of
anty
persecution
and
that
his
own
name
would
be
so
mixed
up
with
lynch
in
the
transaction
as
to
leave
him
no
means
of
escaping
the
ignominy
which
was
so
justly
due
to
his
employer
beyond
these
selfish
motives
of
wishing
to
withdraw
from
the
business
he
really
pitied
anty
and
felt
a
great
repugnance
at
being
the
means
of
adding
to
her
troubles
and
he
was
aware
of
the
scandalous
shame
of
subjecting
her
again
to
the
of
such
a
wretch
as
her
brother
by
threatening
proceedings
which
he
knew
could
never
be
taken
as
he
got
on
the
car
to
return
to
tuam
he
determined
that
whatever
plan
he
might
settle
on
adopting
he
would
have
nothing
further
to
do
with
prosecuting
or
persecuting
either
anty
or
the
kellys
i
give
him
the
best
advice
i
can
about
it
said
daly
to
himself
and
if
he
do
like
it
he
may
do
the
other
thing
i
would
carry
on
with
this
game
for
all
he
worth
and
that
i
believe
is
not
much
he
had
intended
to
go
direct
to
dunmore
house
from
the
kellys
and
to
have
seen
barry
but
he
would
have
had
to
stop
for
dinner
if
he
had
done
so
and
though
generally
speaking
not
very
squeamish
in
his
society
he
did
not
wish
to
enjoy
another
with
him
it
better
to
get
him
over
to
tuam
thought
he
and
try
and
make
him
see
rason
when
he
sober
nothing
too
hot
or
too
bad
for
him
when
he
mad
dhrunk
afther
dinner
accordingly
lynch
was
again
summoned
to
tuam
and
held
a
second
council
in
the
attorney
little
parlour
daly
commenced
by
telling
him
that
his
sister
had
seen
him
and
had
positively
refused
to
leave
the
inn
and
that
the
widow
and
her
son
had
both
listened
to
the
threats
of
a
prosecution
unmoved
and
undismayed
barry
indulged
in
his
usual
volubility
of
expletives
expressed
his
fixed
intention
of
exterminating
the
kellys
declared
with
many
asseverations
his
conviction
that
his
sister
was
a
lunatic
swore
by
everything
under
in
and
above
the
earth
that
he
would
have
her
shut
up
in
the
lunatic
asylum
in
ballinasloe
in
the
teeth
of
the
lord
chancellor
and
all
the
other
lawyers
in
ireland
cursed
the
shades
of
his
father
deeply
and
copiously
assured
daly
that
he
was
only
prevented
from
recovering
his
own
property
by
the
weakness
and
ignorance
of
his
legal
advisers
and
ended
by
asking
the
attorney
advice
as
to
his
future
conduct
what
the
d
l
then
am
i
to
do
with
the
confounded
ideot
said
he
if
you
take
my
advice
you
do
nothing
what
and
let
her
marry
and
have
that
young
blackguard
brought
up
to
dunmore
under
my
very
nose
i
very
much
afraid
mr
lynch
if
you
wish
to
be
quit
of
martin
kelly
it
is
you
must
lave
dunmore
you
may
be
shure
he
wo
oh
as
for
that
i
nothing
to
tie
me
to
dunmore
i
hate
the
place
i
never
meant
to
live
there
if
i
only
saw
my
sister
properly
taken
care
of
and
that
it
was
put
out
of
her
power
to
throw
herself
away
i
should
leave
it
at
once
between
you
and
me
mr
lynch
she
will
be
taken
care
of
and
as
for
throwing
herself
away
she
must
judge
of
that
herself
take
my
word
for
it
the
best
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
come
to
terms
with
martin
kelly
and
to
sell
out
your
property
in
dunmore
you
make
much
better
terms
before
marriage
than
you
would
afther
it
stands
to
rason
barry
was
half
standing
and
half
sitting
on
the
small
parlour
table
and
there
he
remained
for
a
few
minutes
meditating
on
daly
most
unpleasant
proposal
it
was
a
hard
pill
for
him
to
swallow
and
he
could
get
it
down
without
some
convulsive
grimaces
he
bit
his
under
lip
till
the
blood
came
through
it
and
at
last
said
why
you
taken
this
thing
up
daly
as
if
you
were
to
be
paid
by
the
kellys
instead
of
by
me
i
ca
understand
it
confound
me
if
i
can
daly
turned
very
red
at
the
insinuation
he
was
within
an
ace
of
seizing
lynch
by
the
collar
and
expelling
him
in
a
summary
way
from
his
premises
a
feat
which
he
was
able
to
perform
and
willing
also
for
he
was
sick
of
his
client
but
he
thought
of
it
a
second
time
and
restrained
himself
mr
lynch
he
said
after
a
moment
or
two
that
the
second
time
you
made
an
observation
of
that
kind
to
me
and
i
tell
you
what
if
your
business
was
the
best
in
the
county
instead
of
being
as
bad
a
case
as
was
ever
put
into
a
lawyer
hands
i
would
stand
it
from
you
if
you
think
you
can
let
out
your
passion
against
me
as
you
do
against
your
own
people
you
find
your
mistake
out
very
soon
so
you
betther
mind
what
you
saying
why
what
the
devil
did
i
say
said
lynch
half
abashed
i
not
repeat
it
and
you
had
betther
either
and
now
do
you
choose
to
hear
my
professional
advice
and
behave
to
me
as
you
ought
and
shall
do
or
will
you
go
out
of
this
and
look
out
for
another
attorney
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
jist
as
lieve
you
take
your
business
to
some
one
else
barry
brow
grew
very
black
and
he
looked
at
daly
as
though
he
would
much
like
to
insult
him
again
if
he
dared
but
he
did
not
dare
he
had
no
one
else
to
look
to
for
advice
or
support
he
had
utterly
estranged
from
him
his
father
lawyer
and
though
he
suspected
that
daly
was
not
true
to
him
he
felt
that
he
could
not
break
with
him
he
was
obliged
therefore
to
swallow
his
wrath
though
it
choked
him
and
to
mutter
something
in
the
shape
of
an
apology
it
was
a
mutter
daly
heard
something
about
its
being
only
a
joke
and
not
expecting
to
be
taken
up
so
d
sharp
and
accepting
these
sounds
as
an
again
renewed
his
functions
as
attorney
footnote
amende
honorable
french
apology
will
you
authorise
me
to
see
martin
kelly
and
to
treat
with
him
you
find
it
the
cheapest
thing
you
can
do
and
more
than
that
it
be
what
nobody
can
blame
you
for
how
treat
with
him
i
owe
him
nothing
i
do
see
what
i
got
to
treat
with
him
about
am
i
to
offer
him
half
the
property
on
condition
he
consent
to
marry
my
sister
is
that
what
you
mean
no
that
not
what
i
mean
but
it
come
to
much
the
same
thing
in
the
end
in
the
first
place
you
must
withdraw
all
opposition
to
miss
lynch
marriage
indeed
you
must
give
it
your
direct
sanction
and
in
the
next
place
you
must
make
an
amicable
arrangement
with
martin
about
the
division
of
the
property
what
coolly
give
him
all
he
has
the
impudence
to
ask
throw
up
the
game
altogether
and
pitch
the
whole
stakes
into
his
lap
why
daly
you
well
mr
lynch
finish
your
speech
said
daly
looking
him
full
in
the
face
barry
had
been
on
the
point
of
again
accusing
the
attorney
of
playing
false
to
him
but
he
paused
in
time
he
caught
daly
eye
and
did
not
dare
to
finish
the
sentence
which
he
had
begun
i
ca
understand
you
i
mean
said
he
i
ca
understand
what
you
after
but
go
on
you
right
but
i
ca
see
for
the
life
of
me
what
am
i
to
get
by
such
a
plan
as
that
barry
was
now
cowed
and
frightened
he
had
no
by
him
to
reassure
him
and
he
became
comparatively
speaking
calm
and
subdued
indeed
before
the
interview
was
over
he
fell
into
a
pitiably
lachrymose
tone
and
claimed
sympathy
for
the
many
hardships
he
had
to
undergo
through
the
of
his
family
i
try
and
explain
to
you
mr
lynch
what
you
get
by
it
as
far
as
i
can
understand
your
father
left
about
eight
hundred
between
the
two
that
you
and
your
sisther
and
then
there
the
house
and
furniture
nothing
on
earth
can
keep
her
out
of
her
property
or
prevent
her
from
marrying
whom
she
plases
martin
kelly
who
is
an
honest
fellow
though
sharp
enough
has
set
his
eye
on
her
and
before
many
weeks
you
find
he
make
her
his
wife
undher
these
circumstances
would
he
be
the
best
tenant
you
could
find
for
dunmore
you
not
fond
of
the
place
and
will
be
still
less
so
when
he
your
lave
it
altogether
mr
lynch
give
him
a
laise
of
the
whole
concern
and
if
you
do
that
now
at
once
take
my
word
for
it
you
get
more
out
of
dunmore
than
iver
you
will
by
staying
here
and
fighting
the
matther
out
but
about
the
debts
daly
why
i
suppose
the
fact
is
the
debts
are
all
your
own
eh
well
suppose
they
are
exactly
so
personal
debts
of
your
own
why
when
you
made
some
final
arrangement
about
the
property
you
must
make
some
other
arrangement
with
your
creditors
but
that
quite
a
separate
affair
you
do
expect
martin
kelly
to
pay
your
debts
i
suppose
but
i
might
get
a
sum
of
money
for
the
might
i
i
do
think
martin
able
to
put
a
large
sum
down
i
tell
you
what
i
think
you
might
ask
and
what
i
think
he
would
give
to
get
your
and
consent
to
the
match
and
to
prevent
any
further
difficulty
i
think
he
become
your
tenant
for
the
whole
of
your
share
at
a
rent
of
a
year
and
maybe
he
give
you
three
hundred
pounds
for
the
furniture
and
stock
and
things
about
the
place
if
so
you
should
give
him
a
laise
of
three
lives
there
was
a
good
deal
in
this
proposition
that
was
pleasing
to
mind
five
hundred
without
any
trouble
in
collecting
it
the
power
of
living
abroad
in
the
unrestrained
indulgence
of
hotels
and
billiard
rooms
the
probable
chance
of
being
able
to
retain
his
income
and
bilk
his
creditors
the
prospect
of
shaking
off
from
himself
the
consequences
of
a
connection
with
the
kellys
and
being
for
ever
rid
of
dunmore
encumbrances
these
things
all
opened
before
his
eyes
a
vista
of
future
idle
uncontrolled
enjoyment
just
suited
to
his
taste
and
strongly
tempted
him
at
once
to
close
with
daly
offer
but
still
he
could
hardly
bring
himself
to
consent
to
be
vanquished
by
his
own
sister
it
was
wormwood
to
him
to
think
that
after
all
she
should
be
left
to
the
undisturbed
enjoyment
of
her
father
legacy
he
had
been
by
the
widow
insulted
by
young
kelly
cowed
and
silenced
by
the
attorney
whom
he
had
intended
to
patronise
and
convert
into
a
creature
of
his
own
he
could
however
have
borne
and
put
up
with
all
this
if
he
could
only
have
got
his
will
of
his
sister
but
to
give
up
to
her
who
had
been
his
slave
all
his
life
to
own
at
last
that
he
had
no
power
over
her
whom
he
had
always
looked
upon
as
so
abject
so
mean
a
thing
to
give
in
of
his
own
accord
to
the
robbery
which
had
been
committed
on
him
by
his
own
father
and
to
do
this
while
he
felt
convinced
as
he
still
did
that
a
sufficiently
unscrupulous
attorney
could
save
him
from
such
cruel
disgrace
and
loss
was
a
trial
to
which
he
could
hardly
bring
himself
to
submit
crushed
and
tamed
as
he
was
he
still
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
parlour
table
and
there
he
remained
mute
balancing
the
pros
and
cons
of
daly
plan
daly
waited
a
minute
or
two
for
his
answer
and
finding
that
he
said
nothing
left
him
alone
for
a
time
to
make
up
his
mind
telling
him
that
he
would
return
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
barry
never
moved
from
his
position
it
was
an
important
question
he
had
to
settle
and
so
he
felt
it
for
he
gave
up
to
the
subject
his
undivided
attention
since
his
boyhood
he
had
looked
forward
to
a
life
of
ease
pleasure
and
licence
and
had
longed
for
his
father
death
that
he
might
enjoy
it
it
seemed
now
within
his
reach
for
his
means
though
reduced
would
still
be
sufficient
for
sensual
gratification
but
idle
unprincipled
brutal
castaway
wretch
as
barry
was
he
still
felt
the
degradation
of
inaction
when
he
had
such
stimulating
motives
to
energy
as
unsatisfied
rapacity
and
hatred
for
his
sister
ignorant
as
he
was
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
right
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
it
would
be
wrong
in
him
to
yield
could
he
only
pluck
up
sufficient
courage
to
speak
his
mind
to
daly
and
frighten
him
into
compliance
with
his
wishes
he
still
felt
that
he
might
be
successful
that
he
might
by
some
legal
tactics
at
any
rate
obtain
for
himself
the
management
of
his
sister
property
but
this
he
could
not
do
he
felt
that
daly
was
his
master
and
though
he
still
thought
that
he
might
have
triumphed
had
he
come
sufficiently
prepared
that
is
with
a
considerable
quantum
of
spirits
inside
him
he
knew
himself
well
enough
to
be
aware
that
he
could
do
nothing
without
this
assistance
and
alas
he
could
not
obtain
it
there
he
had
great
reliance
in
the
efficacy
of
whiskey
he
would
trust
much
to
a
large
dose
of
port
wine
but
with
brandy
he
considered
himself
invincible
he
sat
biting
his
lip
trying
to
think
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
trying
to
gain
sufficient
to
finish
his
interview
with
daly
with
some
appearance
of
resolution
and
but
it
was
in
vain
when
the
attorney
returned
his
face
still
plainly
showed
that
he
was
utterly
unresolved
utterly
unable
to
resolve
on
anything
well
mr
lynch
said
daly
will
you
let
me
spake
to
kelly
about
this
or
would
you
rather
sleep
on
the
matther
barry
gave
a
long
sigh
would
he
give
six
hundred
daly
he
still
have
two
hundred
clear
and
think
what
that
be
for
a
fellow
like
him
you
must
ask
him
for
it
yourself
then
i
not
propose
to
him
any
such
thing
upon
my
soul
he
be
a
great
fool
to
give
the
five
hundred
because
he
no
occasion
to
meddle
with
you
in
the
matther
at
all
at
all
but
still
i
think
he
may
give
it
but
as
for
asking
for
more
at
any
rate
i
wo
do
it
you
can
do
what
you
like
yourself
and
am
i
to
sell
the
furniture
and
everything
horses
cattle
and
everything
about
the
place
for
three
hundred
pounds
not
unless
you
like
it
you
ai
mr
lynch
but
i
tell
you
this
if
you
can
do
so
and
do
do
so
it
be
the
best
bargain
you
ever
made
mind
of
it
all
belongs
to
your
sisther
barry
muttered
an
oath
through
his
ground
teeth
he
would
have
liked
to
scratch
the
ashes
of
his
father
from
their
and
wreak
his
vengeance
on
them
whenever
this
degrading
fact
was
named
to
him
but
i
want
the
money
daly
said
he
i
could
get
afloat
unless
i
had
more
than
that
i
could
pay
your
bill
you
know
unless
i
got
a
higher
figure
down
than
that
come
daly
you
must
do
something
for
me
you
must
do
something
you
know
to
earn
the
fees
and
he
tried
to
look
facetious
by
giving
a
wretched
ghastly
grin
my
bill
wo
be
a
long
one
mr
lynch
and
you
may
be
shure
i
trying
to
make
it
as
short
as
i
can
and
as
for
earning
it
whatever
you
may
think
i
can
assure
you
i
shall
never
have
got
money
harder
i
now
given
you
my
best
advice
if
your
mind
not
yet
made
up
perhaps
you
have
the
goodness
to
let
me
hear
from
you
when
it
is
and
daly
walked
from
the
fire
towards
the
door
and
placed
his
hand
upon
the
handle
of
it
this
was
a
hint
which
barry
could
misunderstand
well
i
write
to
you
he
said
and
passed
through
the
door
he
felt
however
that
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
trust
himself
to
his
own
judgment
and
he
turned
back
as
daly
passed
into
his
office
daly
he
said
step
out
one
minute
i
wo
keep
you
a
second
the
attorney
unwillingly
lifted
up
the
counter
and
came
out
to
him
manage
it
your
own
way
said
he
do
whatever
you
think
best
but
you
must
see
that
i
been
badly
used
infernally
cruelly
treated
and
you
ought
to
do
the
best
you
can
for
me
here
am
i
giving
away
as
i
may
say
my
own
property
to
a
young
shopkeeper
and
upon
my
soul
you
ought
to
make
him
pay
something
for
it
upon
my
soul
you
ought
for
it
only
fair
i
tould
you
mr
lynch
what
i
propose
to
martin
kelly
if
you
do
think
the
terms
fair
you
can
propose
any
others
yourself
or
you
at
liberty
to
employ
any
other
agent
you
please
barry
sighed
again
but
he
yielded
he
felt
and
unhappy
and
he
longed
to
quit
a
country
so
distasteful
to
him
and
relatives
and
neighbours
so
ungrateful
he
longed
in
his
heart
for
the
sweet
easy
haunts
of
boulogne
which
he
had
never
known
but
of
which
he
had
heard
many
a
glowing
description
from
congenial
spirits
whom
he
knew
he
had
heard
enough
of
the
ways
and
means
of
many
a
leading
star
in
that
elysium
to
be
aware
that
with
five
hundred
unembarrassed
and
punctually
paid
he
might
shine
as
a
prince
indeed
he
would
go
at
once
to
that
happy
foreign
shore
where
the
memory
of
no
father
would
follow
him
where
the
presence
of
no
sister
would
degrade
and
irritate
him
where
were
rife
and
brandy
cheap
where
virtue
was
easy
and
restraint
unnecessary
where
no
duties
would
harass
him
no
tenants
upbraid
him
no
duns
persecute
him
there
carefully
guarding
himself
against
the
schemes
of
those
less
fortunate
followers
of
pleasure
among
whom
he
would
be
thrown
in
his
social
hours
he
would
convert
every
shilling
of
his
income
to
some
purpose
of
and
live
a
life
of
luxurious
abandonment
and
he
need
not
be
altogether
idle
he
reflected
within
himself
afterwards
as
he
was
riding
home
he
felt
that
he
was
possessed
of
sufficient
energy
and
talent
to
make
himself
perfectly
master
of
a
pack
of
cards
to
be
a
proficient
over
a
and
even
to
get
the
upper
hand
of
a
box
of
dice
with
such
pursuits
left
to
him
he
might
yet
live
to
be
talked
of
feared
and
wealthy
and
barry
utmost
ambition
would
have
carried
him
no
further
as
i
said
before
he
yielded
to
the
attorney
and
commissioned
him
fully
to
treat
with
martin
kelly
in
the
manner
proposed
by
himself
martin
was
to
give
him
five
hundred
for
his
share
of
the
property
and
three
hundred
pounds
for
the
furniture
and
barry
was
to
give
his
sister
his
written
and
unconditional
assent
to
her
marriage
was
to
sign
any
document
which
might
be
necessary
as
to
her
settlement
and
was
then
to
leave
dunmore
for
ever
daly
made
him
write
an
authority
for
making
such
a
proposal
by
which
he
bound
himself
to
the
terms
should
they
be
acceded
to
by
the
other
party
but
you
must
bear
in
mind
added
daly
as
his
client
for
the
second
time
turned
from
the
door
that
i
do
guarantee
that
martin
kelly
will
accept
these
terms
it
very
likely
he
may
be
sharp
enough
to
know
that
he
can
manage
as
well
without
you
as
he
can
with
you
remember
that
mr
lynch
i
will
i
will
daly
but
look
here
if
he
bites
freely
and
i
think
he
will
and
if
you
find
you
could
get
as
much
as
a
thousand
out
of
him
or
even
eight
hundred
you
shall
have
one
hundred
clear
for
yourself
this
was
barry
last
piece
of
diplomacy
for
that
day
daly
vouchsafed
him
no
answer
but
returned
into
his
office
and
barry
mounted
his
horse
and
returned
home
not
altogether
with
his
prospects
but
still
regretting
that
he
should
have
gone
about
so
serious
a
piece
of
business
so
utterly
unprepared
these
regrets
rose
stronger
when
his
courage
returned
to
him
as
he
sate
solitary
over
his
fire
i
should
have
had
him
here
said
he
to
himself
and
not
gone
to
that
confounded
cold
hole
of
his
after
all
there
no
place
for
a
cock
to
fight
on
like
his
own
dunghill
and
there
nothing
able
to
carry
a
fellow
well
through
a
tough
bit
of
jobation
with
a
lawyer
like
a
stiff
tumbler
of
brandy
punch
it
have
been
worth
a
couple
of
hundred
to
me
to
have
had
him
out
here
impertinent
puppy
well
devil
a
halfpenny
i
pay
him
this
thought
was
consolatory
and
he
began
again
to
think
of
boulogne

a
tedious
session
scolding
xxi
lord
ballindine
at
home
two
days
after
the
last
recorded
interview
between
lord
ballindine
and
his
friend
dot
blake
the
former
found
himself
once
more
sitting
down
to
dinner
with
his
mother
and
sisters
the
honourable
mrs
and
the
honourable
misses
at
least
such
were
the
titular
dignities
conferred
on
them
in
county
mayo
though
i
believe
strictly
speaking
the
young
ladies
had
no
claim
to
the
appellation
mrs
was
a
very
small
woman
with
no
particularly
developed
character
and
perhaps
of
no
very
general
utility
she
was
fond
of
her
daughters
and
more
than
fond
of
her
son
partly
because
he
was
so
tall
and
so
handsome
and
partly
because
he
was
the
lord
the
head
of
the
family
and
the
owner
of
the
house
she
was
on
the
whole
a
person
though
perhaps
her
temper
was
a
little
soured
by
her
husband
having
very
unfairly
died
before
he
had
given
her
a
right
to
call
herself
lady
ballindine
she
was
naturally
shy
and
reserved
and
the
seclusion
of
court
did
not
tend
to
make
her
less
so
but
she
felt
that
the
position
and
rank
of
her
son
required
her
to
be
dignified
and
consequently
when
in
society
she
somewhat
ridiculously
aggravated
her
natural
timidity
with
an
assumed
rigidity
of
demeanour
she
was
however
a
good
woman
striving
with
small
means
to
do
the
best
for
her
family
prudent
and
and
very
diligent
in
looking
after
the
house
servants
her
two
daughters
had
been
at
the
instance
of
their
grandfather
the
courtier
christened
augusta
and
sophia
after
the
two
princesses
of
that
name
and
were
now
called
guss
and
sophy
they
were
both
pretty
girls
one
with
dark
brown
and
the
other
light
brown
hair
they
both
played
the
harp
badly
sung
tolerably
danced
well
and
were
very
fond
of
nice
young
men
they
both
thought
kelly
court
rather
dull
but
then
they
had
known
nothing
better
since
they
had
grown
up
and
there
were
some
tolerably
nice
people
not
very
far
off
whom
they
occasionally
saw
there
were
the
dillons
of
ballyhaunis
who
had
three
thousand
and
spent
six
they
were
really
a
delightful
family
three
daughters
and
four
sons
all
unmarried
and
up
to
anything
the
sons
all
hunted
shot
danced
and
did
everything
that
they
ought
to
do
at
least
in
the
eyes
of
young
ladies
though
some
of
their
more
coldly
prudent
acquaintances
expressed
an
opinion
that
it
would
be
as
well
if
the
three
younger
would
think
of
doing
something
for
themselves
but
they
looked
so
manly
and
handsome
when
they
breakfasted
at
kelly
court
on
a
hunt
morning
with
their
bright
tops
red
coats
and
that
guss
and
sophy
and
a
great
many
others
thought
it
would
be
a
shame
to
interrupt
them
in
their
career
and
then
ballyhaunis
was
only
eight
miles
from
kelly
court
though
they
were
irish
miles
it
is
true
and
the
road
was
not
patronised
by
the
grand
jury
but
the
distance
was
only
eight
miles
and
there
were
always
beds
for
them
when
they
went
to
dinner
at
peter
dillon
then
there
were
the
blakes
of
castletown
to
be
sure
they
could
give
no
parties
for
they
were
both
unmarried
but
they
were
none
the
worse
for
that
and
they
had
plenty
of
horses
and
went
out
everywhere
and
the
blakes
of
morristown
they
also
were
very
nice
people
only
unfortunately
old
blake
was
always
on
his
keeping
and
could
show
himself
out
of
doors
except
on
sundays
for
fear
of
the
bailiffs
and
the
browns
of
mount
dillon
and
the
browns
of
castle
brown
and
general
bourke
of
creamstown
all
these
families
lived
within
fifteen
or
sixteen
miles
of
kelly
court
and
prevented
the
from
feeling
themselves
quite
isolated
from
the
social
world
their
nearest
neighbours
however
were
the
armstrongs
and
of
them
they
saw
a
great
deal
the
reverend
joseph
armstrong
was
rector
of
ballindine
and
mrs
was
his
parishioner
and
the
only
protestant
one
he
had
and
as
mr
armstrong
did
not
like
to
see
his
church
quite
deserted
and
as
mrs
was
as
she
flattered
herself
a
very
fervent
protestant
they
were
all
in
all
to
each
other
ballindine
was
not
a
good
living
and
mr
armstrong
had
a
very
large
family
he
was
therefore
a
poor
man
his
children
were
helpless
uneducated
and
improvident
his
wife
was
nearly
worn
out
with
the
labours
of
bringing
them
forth
and
afterwards
catering
for
them
and
a
great
portion
of
his
own
life
was
taken
up
in
a
hard
battle
with
tradesmen
and
creditors
and
debtors
yet
in
spite
of
the
insufficiency
of
his
two
hundred
to
meet
all
or
half
his
wants
mr
armstrong
was
not
an
unhappy
man
at
any
moment
of
social
enjoyment
he
forgot
all
his
cares
and
poverty
and
was
always
the
first
to
laugh
and
the
last
to
cease
to
do
so
he
never
refused
an
invitation
to
dinner
and
if
he
did
not
entertain
many
in
his
own
house
it
was
his
fortune
and
not
his
heart
that
prevented
him
from
doing
so
he
could
hardly
be
called
a
good
clergyman
and
yet
his
remissness
was
not
so
much
his
own
fault
as
that
of
circumstances
how
could
a
protestant
rector
be
a
good
parish
clergyman
with
but
one
old
lady
and
her
daughters
for
the
exercise
of
his
clerical
energies
and
talents
he
constantly
lauded
the
zeal
of
paul
for
proselytism
but
as
he
himself
once
observed
even
paul
had
never
had
to
deal
with
the
obstinacy
of
an
irish
roman
catholic
he
often
regretted
the
want
of
work
and
grieved
that
his
profession
as
far
as
he
saw
and
had
been
instructed
required
nothing
of
him
but
a
short
service
on
every
sunday
morning
and
the
celebration
of
the
eucharist
four
times
but
such
were
the
facts
and
the
idleness
which
this
want
of
work
engendered
and
the
habits
which
his
poverty
induced
had
given
him
a
character
as
a
clergyman
very
different
from
that
which
the
high
feelings
and
strict
principles
which
animated
him
at
his
ordination
would
have
seemed
to
ensure
he
was
in
fact
a
loose
slovenly
man
somewhat
too
fond
of
his
tumbler
of
punch
a
little
lax
perhaps
as
to
clerical
discipline
but
very
staunch
as
to
doctrine
he
possessed
no
industry
or
energy
of
any
kind
but
he
was
and
charitable
lived
on
friendly
terms
with
all
his
neighbours
and
was
intimate
with
every
one
that
dwelt
within
ten
miles
of
him
priest
and
parson
lord
and
commoner
such
was
the
neighbourhood
of
kelly
court
and
among
such
lord
ballindine
had
now
made
up
his
mind
to
remain
a
while
till
circumstances
should
decide
what
further
steps
he
should
take
with
regard
to
fanny
wyndham
there
were
a
few
hunting
days
left
in
the
season
which
he
intended
to
enjoy
and
then
he
must
manage
to
make
shift
to
lull
the
time
with
shooting
fishing
farming
and
nursing
his
horses
and
dogs
his
mother
and
sisters
had
heard
nothing
of
the
rumour
of
the
quarrel
between
frank
and
fanny
which
mat
tierney
had
so
openly
alluded
to
at
handicap
lodge
and
he
was
rather
put
out
by
their
eager
questions
on
the
subject
nothing
was
said
about
it
till
the
servant
withdrew
after
dinner
but
the
three
ladies
were
too
anxious
for
information
to
delay
their
curiosity
any
longer
well
frank
said
the
elder
sister
who
was
sitting
over
the
fire
close
to
his
left
elbow
he
had
a
bottle
of
claret
at
his
right
well
frank
do
tell
us
something
about
fanny
wyndham
we
are
so
longing
to
hear
and
you
never
will
write
you
know
everybody
says
it
a
brilliant
match
said
the
mother
they
say
here
she
forty
thousand
pounds
i
sure
i
hope
she
has
frank
but
when
is
it
to
be
said
sophy
she
of
age
now
is
she
and
i
thought
you
were
only
waiting
for
that
i
sure
we
shall
like
her
come
frank
do
tell
us
when
are
we
to
see
lady
ballindine
frank
looked
rather
serious
and
embarrassed
but
did
not
immediately
make
any
reply
you
have
quarrelled
have
you
frank
said
the
mother
the
match
is
off
is
it
said
guss
miss
wyndham
has
just
lost
her
only
brother
said
he
he
died
quite
suddenly
in
london
about
ten
days
since
she
was
very
much
attached
to
him
good
gracious
how
shocking
said
sophy
i
sorry
said
guss
why
frank
said
their
mother
now
excited
into
absolute
animation
his
fortune
was
more
than
double
hers
was
it
who
have
it
now
it
was
mother
five
times
as
much
as
hers
i
believe
gracious
powers
and
who
has
it
now
why
do
you
tell
me
frank
his
sister
fanny
heavens
and
earth
i
hope
you
not
going
to
let
her
quarrel
with
you
are
you
has
there
been
anything
between
you
have
there
been
any
words
between
you
and
lord
cashel
why
do
you
tell
me
frank
when
you
know
how
anxious
i
am
if
you
must
know
all
about
it
i
have
not
had
any
words
as
you
call
them
with
fanny
wyndham
but
i
have
with
her
guardian
he
thinks
a
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
pounds
much
too
great
a
fortune
for
a
connaught
viscount
however
i
do
think
so
it
will
be
for
time
to
show
what
fanny
thinks
meanwhile
the
less
said
about
it
the
better
remember
that
girls
will
you
oh
we
will
we
wo
say
a
word
about
it
but
she
never
change
her
mind
because
of
her
money
will
she
that
what
would
make
me
love
a
man
twice
the
more
said
guss
or
at
any
rate
show
it
twice
the
stronger
frank
said
the
anxious
mother
for
heaven
sake
do
let
anything
stand
between
you
and
lord
cashel
think
what
a
thing
it
is
you
lose
why
it
pay
all
the
debts
and
leave
the
property
worth
twice
what
it
ever
was
before
if
lord
cashel
thinks
you
ought
to
give
up
the
hounds
do
it
at
once
frank
anything
rather
than
quarrel
with
him
you
could
get
them
again
you
know
when
all
settled
i
given
up
quite
as
much
as
i
intend
for
lord
cashel
now
frank
do
be
a
fool
or
you
repent
it
all
your
life
what
does
it
signify
how
much
you
give
up
to
such
a
man
as
lord
cashel
you
do
think
do
you
that
he
objects
to
our
being
at
kelly
court
because
i
sure
we
would
stay
a
moment
if
we
thought
that
mother
i
would
part
with
a
cur
dog
out
of
the
place
to
please
lord
cashel
but
if
i
were
to
do
everything
on
earth
at
his
beck
and
will
it
would
make
no
difference
he
will
never
let
me
marry
fanny
wyndham
if
he
can
help
it
but
thank
god
i
do
believe
he
can
i
hope
not
i
hope
not
you
never
see
half
such
a
fortune
again
well
mother
say
nothing
about
it
one
way
or
the
other
to
anybody
and
as
you
now
know
how
the
matter
stands
it
no
good
any
of
us
talking
more
about
it
till
i
settled
what
i
mean
to
do
myself
i
shall
hate
her
said
sophy
if
her
getting
all
her
brother
money
changes
her
but
i
sure
it
wo
and
so
the
conversation
ended
lord
ballindine
had
not
rested
in
his
paternal
halls
the
second
night
before
he
had
commenced
making
arrangements
for
a
hunt
breakfast
by
way
of
letting
all
his
friends
know
that
he
was
again
among
them
and
so
missives
in
guss
and
sophy
handwriting
were
sent
round
by
a
little
boy
to
all
the
mounts
towns
and
castles
belonging
to
the
dillons
blakes
bourkes
and
browns
of
the
neighbourhood
to
tell
them
that
the
dogs
would
draw
the
kelly
court
covers
at
eleven
on
the
following
tuesday
morning
and
that
the
preparatory
breakfast
would
be
on
the
table
at
ten
this
was
welcome
news
to
the
whole
neighbourhood
it
was
only
on
the
sunday
evening
that
the
sportsmen
got
the
intimation
and
very
busy
most
of
them
were
on
the
following
monday
to
see
that
their
nags
and
breeches
were
all
right
fit
to
work
and
fit
to
be
seen
the
four
dillons
of
ballyhaunis
gave
out
to
their
grooms
a
large
assortment
of
and
bingham
blake
of
castletown
ordered
a
new
set
of
girths
to
his
hunting
saddle
and
his
brother
jerry
who
was
in
no
slight
degree
proud
of
his
legs
but
whose
nether
trappings
were
rather
the
worse
from
the
constant
work
of
a
heavy
season
went
so
far
as
to
go
forth
very
early
on
the
monday
morning
to
excite
the
ballinrobe
tailor
to
undertake
the
almost
impossible
task
of
completing
him
a
pair
of
doeskin
by
the
tuesday
morning
the
work
was
done
and
the
breeches
home
at
castletown
by
eight
though
the
doeskin
had
to
be
purchased
in
tuam
and
an
assistant
artist
taken
away
from
his
mother
wake
to
sit
up
all
night
over
the
seams
but
then
the
tailor
owed
a
small
trifle
of
arrear
of
rent
for
his
and
his
landlord
was
jerry
blake
there
nothing
carries
one
further
than
a
good
connexion
thought
both
jerry
and
the
tailor
when
the
job
was
finished
footnote
first
cousin
among
the
other
invitations
sent
was
one
to
martin
kelly
not
exactly
worded
like
the
others
for
though
lord
ballindine
was
perhaps
more
anxious
to
see
him
than
anyone
else
martin
had
not
yet
got
quite
so
high
in
the
ladder
of
life
as
to
be
asked
to
breakfast
at
court
but
the
fact
that
frank
for
a
moment
thought
of
asking
him
showed
that
he
was
looking
upwards
in
the
world
estimation
frank
wrote
him
a
note
himself
saying
that
the
hounds
would
throw
off
at
kelly
court
at
eleven
that
if
he
would
ride
over
he
would
be
sure
to
see
a
good
hunt
and
that
he
lord
ballindine
had
a
few
words
to
say
to
him
on
business
just
while
the
dogs
were
being
put
into
the
cover
martin
as
usual
had
a
good
horse
which
he
was
disposed
to
sell
if
as
he
said
he
got
its
value
and
wrote
to
say
he
would
wait
on
lord
ballindine
at
eleven
the
truth
was
frank
wanted
to
borrow
money
from
him
another
note
was
sent
to
the
glebe
requesting
the
rector
to
come
to
breakfast
and
to
look
at
the
hounds
being
thrown
off
the
modest
style
of
the
invitation
was
considered
as
due
to
mr
armstrong
clerical
position
but
was
hardly
rendered
necessary
by
his
habits
for
though
the
parson
attended
such
meetings
in
an
old
suit
of
rusty
black
and
rode
an
equally
pony
he
was
always
to
be
seen
at
the
end
of
the
day
among
those
who
were
left
around
the
dogs
on
the
tuesday
morning
there
was
a
good
deal
of
bustle
at
court
all
the
boys
about
the
place
were
collected
in
front
of
the
house
to
walk
the
gentlemen
horses
about
while
the
riders
were
at
breakfast
and
earn
a
sixpence
or
a
fourpenny
bit
and
among
them
sitting
idly
on
the
big
steppingstone
placed
near
the
door
was
jack
the
fool
who
for
the
day
seemed
to
have
deserted
the
service
of
barry
lynch
and
now
the
flocked
up
to
the
door
and
it
was
laughable
to
see
the
knowledge
of
character
displayed
by
the
gossoons
in
the
selection
of
their
customers
one
or
two
who
were
known
to
be
bad
pays
were
allowed
to
dismount
without
molestation
of
any
kind
and
could
not
even
part
with
their
steeds
till
they
had
come
to
an
absolute
bargain
as
to
the
amount
of
gratuity
to
be
given
lambert
brown
was
one
of
these
unfortunate
characters
a
younger
brother
who
had
a
little
and
but
a
very
little
money
and
who
was
determined
to
keep
that
he
was
a
miserable
at
his
brother
house
without
profession
or
prospects
greedy
stingy
and
disagreeable
endowed
with
a
squint
and
long
lank
hair
he
was
a
bad
horseman
always
craning
and
shirking
in
the
field
boasting
and
lying
after
dinner
nevertheless
he
was
invited
and
endured
because
he
was
one
of
the
browns
of
mount
dillon
cousin
to
the
browns
of
castle
brown
nephew
to
mrs
dillon
the
member
wife
and
third
cousin
of
lord
ballaghaderrin
he
dismounted
in
the
gravel
circle
before
the
door
and
looked
round
for
someone
to
take
his
horse
but
none
of
the
urchins
would
come
to
him
at
last
he
caught
hold
of
a
little
ragged
boy
whom
he
knew
from
his
own
side
of
the
country
and
who
had
come
all
the
way
there
eight
long
irish
miles
on
the
chance
of
earning
sixpence
and
seeing
a
hunt
here
patsy
come
here
you
born
little
divil
and
he
laid
hold
of
the
arm
of
the
brat
who
was
trying
to
escape
from
him
come
and
hold
my
horse
for
me
and
i
not
forget
you
shure
yer
honer
mr
lambert
i
ca
thin
for
i
afther
engaging
myself
this
blessed
minute
to
mr
larry
dillon
only
he
jist
trotted
round
to
the
stables
to
spake
a
word
to
mick
keogh
do
be
lying
you
little
blackguard
hould
the
horse
and
do
stir
out
of
that
shure
how
can
i
mr
lambert
when
i
been
and
guv
my
word
to
mr
larry
and
the
little
fellow
put
his
hands
behind
him
that
he
might
not
be
forced
to
take
hold
of
the
reins
do
talk
to
me
you
young
imp
but
take
the
horse
i
not
forget
you
when
i
come
out
what
the
matter
with
you
you
fool
d
think
i
tell
you
a
lie
about
it
patsy
evidently
thought
he
would
for
though
he
took
the
horse
almost
upon
compulsion
he
whimpered
as
he
did
so
and
said
shure
mr
lambert
would
you
go
and
rob
a
poor
boy
of
his
chances
i
come
all
the
way
from
ballyglass
this
blessed
morning
to
a
tizzy
and
av
i
does
get
it
from
you
this
turn
i
but
lambert
brown
had
gone
into
the
house
and
on
his
return
after
breakfast
he
fully
justified
the
lad
suspicion
for
he
again
promised
him
that
he
would
forget
him
and
that
he
see
him
some
day
at
mr
dillon
well
lambert
brown
said
the
boy
as
that
worthy
gentleman
rode
off
it
you
the
raal
blackguard
and
it
well
all
the
counthry
knows
you
sorrow
be

bed
this
night
it
little
the
poor
grieve
for
you
when
you
stretched
or
the
rich
either
for
the
matther
of
that
very
different
was
the
reception
bingham
blake
got
as
he
drove
up
with
his
tandem
and
had
kept
themselves
idle
each
in
the
hope
of
being
the
lucky
individual
to
come
in
for
shilling
och
mr
bingham
shure
i
first
roared
one
fellow
but
the
first
as
he
styled
himself
was
soon
knocked
down
under
the
wheels
of
the
cart
by
the
others
mr
blake
thin
mr
blake
darlint
does
ye
remimber
the
promise
you
guv
me
mr
jerry
mr
jerry
avick
this
was
addressed
to
the
brother
spake
a
word
for
me
do
yer
honour
shure
it
was
i
come
all
the
way
from
teddy
mahony
with
the
breeches
this
morning
god
bless
and
the
fine
legs
as
is
in
but
they
were
all
balked
for
blake
had
his
servant
there
get
out
you
blackguards
said
he
raising
his
tandem
whip
as
if
to
strike
them
get
out
you
robbers
are
you
going
to
take
the
cart
and
horses
clean
away
from
me
that
mare
settle
some
of
ye
if
you
make
so
free
with
her
she
not
a
bit
too
chary
of
her
hind
feet
get
out
of
that
i
tell
you
and
he
lightly
struck
with
the
point
of
his
whip
the
boy
who
had
lambert
brown
horse
ah
mr
bingham
said
the
boy
pretending
to
rub
the
part
very
hard
you
owe
me
one
for
that
anyhow
and
it
you
are
the
good
mark
for
it
god
bless
you
faix
said
another
one
blow
from
your
honour
is
worth
two
promises
from
lambert
brown
any
way
there
was
a
great
laugh
at
this
among
the
ragged
crew
for
lambert
brown
was
still
standing
on
the
doorsteps
when
he
heard
this
sally
however
he
walked
in
and
the
different
and
were
not
long
in
crowding
after
him
lord
ballindine
received
them
in
the
same
costume
and
very
glad
they
all
seemed
to
see
him
again
when
an
irish
gentleman
is
popular
in
his
neighbourhood
nothing
can
exceed
the
real
devotion
paid
to
him
and
when
that
gentleman
is
a
master
of
hounds
and
does
not
require
a
subscription
he
is
more
than
ever
so
welcome
back
ballindine
better
late
than
never
but
why
did
you
stay
away
so
long
said
general
bourke
an
old
gentleman
with
long
thin
flowing
grey
hairs
waving
beneath
his
felt
you
not
getting
so
fond
of
the
turf
i
hope
as
to
be
giving
up
the
field
for
it
give
me
the
sport
where
i
can
ride
my
own
horse
myself
not
where
i
must
pay
a
young
rascal
for
doing
it
for
me
and
robbing
me
into
the
bargain
most
likely
quite
right
general
said
frank
so
you
see
i
given
up
the
curragh
and
come
down
to
the
dogs
again
yes
but
you
waited
too
long
man
the
dogs
have
nearly
done
their
work
for
this
year
i
sorry
for
it
the
last
day
of
the
season
is
the
worst
day
in
the
year
to
me
i
ill
for
a
week
after
it
well
general
please
the
pigs
we
be
in
great
tune
next
october
i
as
fine
a
set
of
puppies
to
enter
as
there
is
in
ireland
let
alone
connaught
you
must
come
down
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
them
next
october
all
very
well
for
you
young
fellows
but
i
always
make
up
my
mind
that
i
never
turn
out
another
season
and
it
be
true
for
me
this
year
i
hunting
over
sixty
years
ballindine
in
these
three
counties
i
ought
to
have
had
enough
of
it
by
this
time
you
say
i
bet
you
ten
pounds
said
bingham
blake
that
you
hunt
after
eighty
done
with
you
bingham
said
the
general
and
the
bet
was
booked
general
bourke
was
an
old
soldier
who
told
the
truth
in
saying
that
he
had
hunted
over
the
same
ground
sixty
years
ago
but
he
had
not
been
at
it
ever
since
for
he
had
in
the
meantime
seen
a
great
deal
of
hard
active
service
and
obtained
high
military
reputation
but
he
had
again
taken
kindly
to
the
national
sport
of
his
country
on
returning
to
his
own
estate
at
the
close
of
the
peninsular
war
and
had
ever
since
attended
the
meets
twice
a
week
through
every
winter
with
fewer
exceptions
than
any
other
member
of
the
hunt
he
always
wore
of
the
ancient
cut
with
deep
painted
tops
and
square
toes
drawn
tight
up
over
the
calf
of
his
leg
a
pair
of
most
capacious
leather
breeches
the
origin
of
which
was
unknown
to
any
other
present
member
of
the
hunt
and
a
red
frock
coat
very
much
soiled
by
weather
water
and
wear
the
general
was
a
rich
man
and
therefore
always
had
a
horse
to
suit
him
on
the
present
occasion
he
was
riding
a
strong
brown
beast
called
parsimony
that
would
climb
over
anything
and
creep
down
the
gable
end
of
a
house
if
he
were
required
to
do
so
he
was
got
by
oeconomy
those
who
know
county
mayo
know
the
breed
well
they
were
now
all
crowded
into
the
large
at
kelly
court
about
redcoats
and
mr
armstrong
rusty
black
in
spite
of
his
shabby
appearance
however
and
the
fact
that
the
greater
number
of
those
around
him
were
roman
catholics
he
seemed
to
be
very
popular
with
the
lot
and
his
opinion
on
the
important
subject
of
its
being
a
scenting
morning
was
asked
with
as
much
confidence
in
his
judgment
as
though
the
foxes
of
the
country
were
peculiarly
subject
to
episcopalian
jurisdiction
well
then
peter
said
he
the
wind
in
the
right
quarter
mick
says
there
a
strong
in
the
long
bit
of
gorse
behind
the
firs
if
he
breaks
from
that
he
must
run
towards
ballintubber
and
when
you
once
over
the
meering
into
roscommon
there
not
an
acre
of
tilled
land
unless
a
herd
garden
between
that
and
the
deuce
knows
where
all
further
than
most
of
you
like
to
ride
i
take
it
footnote
meering
a
boundary
such
as
a
ditch
or
fence
between
farms
fields
bogs
etc
how
far
you
go
yourself
armstrong
faith
i
believe
it
few
of
the
crack
nags
beat
the
old
black
pony
at
a
long
day
is
it
i
said
the
parson
innocently
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
dogs
give
tongue
and
seen
them
well
on
their
game
i
go
home
i
land
ploughing
and
i
must
look
after
that
but
as
i
was
saying
if
the
fox
breaks
well
away
from
the
gorse
you
have
the
best
run
you
seen
this
season
but
if
he
dodges
back
into
the
plantation
you
have
enough
to
do
to
make
him
break
at
all
and
when
he
does
he
go
away
towards
ballyhaunis
through
as
cross
a
country
as
ever
a
horse
put
a
shoe
into
and
having
uttered
this
scientific
prediction
which
was
listened
to
with
the
greatest
deference
by
peter
dillon
the
rev
joseph
armstrong
turned
his
attention
to
the
ham
and
tea
the
three
ladies
were
all
smiles
to
meet
their
guests
mrs
dressed
in
a
piece
of
satin
turk
came
forward
to
shake
hands
with
the
general
but
sophy
and
guss
kept
their
positions
beneath
the
and
at
each
end
of
the
long
table
being
very
properly
of
opinion
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
younger
part
of
the
community
to
come
forward
and
make
their
overtures
to
them
bingham
blake
the
cynosure
on
whom
the
eyes
of
the
beauty
of
county
mayo
were
most
generally
placed
soon
found
his
seat
beside
guss
rather
to
sophy
mortification
but
sophy
was
and
when
peter
dillon
placed
himself
at
her
right
hand
she
was
quite
happy
though
peter
father
was
still
alive
and
bingham
had
been
dead
this
many
a
year
and
castletown
much
in
want
of
a
mistress
now
miss
said
bingham
do
let
me
manage
the
the
and
will
be
quite
enough
for
your
energies
indeed
and
i
wo
mr
blake
you
a
great
deal
too
awkward
and
a
great
deal
too
hungry
the
last
you
breakfasted
here
you
threw
the
into
the
when
i
let
you
help
me
to
think
of
your
remembering
that
but
i
improved
since
then
been
taking
lessons

my
old
aunt

a
husband

make
when

little
more
improved

i
as
you
so
fond
of
accomplishments

you
take
me
yourself
why
as
you

useful

lambert
said
lord
ballindine
across
the
table

the
stingy
gentleman
with
the
squint
are

going
to
ride
hard
i
go
bail
i
not
much
behind
my
lord
said
lambert

lambert
said
his
cousin
young
brown
of
mount
brown
the
dogs
kill
and
you
do
see
them
do
it
oh
that
may
be
and
yet
i
may
be
much
behind

the
next
field
to
them
maybe
you
not
be
within
ten
fields
yourself
come
lambert
i
tell
you
what
we

together
and
i
bet
you
a
crown

three
leaps
ah
now

it
easy
with
yourself
said
lambert
there

but
no
one
better
than

that
it
eh
well
jerry
how

the
new
articles
fit
said
nicholas
dillon
pretty
well
thank
you
they
be
a
deal
more
comfortable
though
if
you
pay
for
them
did
you
hear
miss
what
jerry
blake
did
yesterday
said
nicholas
dillon
aloud
across
the
table
indeed
i
did
not
said
guss
but
i
hope
for
the
sake
of
the
blakes
in
general
he
did
do
anything
much
amiss
i
tell
you
then
continued
nicholas
a
portion
of
his
ould
i
not
specify
what
you
know
but
a
portion
which
he
been
wearing
since
the
last
election
were
too
shabby
to
show
well
he
could
catch
a
hedge
tailor
far
or
near
only
poor
lame
andy
oulahan
who
was
burying
his
wife
rest
her
sowl
the
very
moment
jerry
got
a
howld
of
him
well
jerry
was
wild
that
the
tailors
were
so
scarce
so
he
laid
his
hands
on
andy
dragged
him
away
from
the
corpse
and
all
the
illigant
enthertainment
of
the
funeral
and
never
let
him
out
of
sight
till
he
put
on
the
last
button
oh
mr
blake
said
guss
you
did
not
take
the
man
away
from
his
dead
wife
indeed
i

such
good
chance
his
to
the
fore
this
day
worse
luck
for
him
it
was
only
his
mother

burying
but

did
take
him
away
from
his
mother
funeral

did
it
according
to
law
you
know
i
got
bingham
to
give
me
a
warrant
first
before
i
let
the
policeman
lay
a
hand
on
him
now
general

no

you
a
hot
cup
of
coffee

drop
more
mrs

than
well
but

i
just
take
a
crust
of
bread
in
my
pocket
and
what
would
you
do
that
for
you
be
coming
back
to
lunch
you
know

it
lunch
mrs
pray
do
think
of
troubling
yourself
to
have
lunch
on
the
table
maybe
we
be
a
deal
nearer
creamstown
than
kelly
court
at
lunch
time
but
it
quite
time
we
were
off
as
for
bingham
blake
from
the
look
of
him
he
going
to
stay
here
with
your
daughter
augusta
all
the
morning
i
believe
then
he
much
sooner
be
with
the
dogs
general
than
losing
his
time
with
her
are
you
going
to
move
at
all
ballindine
said
the
impatient
old
sportsman
do
you
know
what
time
it
is
it
be
twelve
before
you
have
the
dogs
in
the
cover
very
good
time
too
general
men
must
eat
you
know
and
the
fox
wo
stir
till
we
move
him
but
come
gentlemen
you
seem
to
be
dropping
your
knives
and
forks
suppose
we
get
into
our
saddles
and
again
the
sallied
out
bingham
gave
guss
a
tender
squeeze
which
she
all
but
returned
as
she
bade
him
take
care
and
not
go
and
kill
himself
peter
dillon
stayed
to
have
a
few
last
words
with
sophy
and
to
impress
upon
her
his
sister
nora
message
that
she
and
sister
were
to
be
sure
to
come
over
on
friday
to
ballyhaunis
and
spend
the
night
there
we
will
if
we
let
tell
nora
said
sophy
but
now
frank
at
home
we
must
mind
him
you
know
make
him
bring
you
over
there
be
a
bed
for
him
the
old
house
is
big
enough
heaven
knows
indeed
it
is
well
i
do
my
best
but
tell
nora
to
be
sure
and
get
the
fiddler
from
hollymount
it
so
stupid
for
her
to
be
sitting
there
at
the
piano
while
we
dancing
i
manage
that
only
do
you
bring
frank
to
dance
with
her
and
another
tender
squeeze
was
given
and
peter
hurried
out
to
the
horses
and
now
they
were
all
gone
but
the
parson
mrs
said
he
mrs
armstrong
wants
a
favour
from
you
poor
minny
very
bad
with
her
throat
she
did
get
a
wink
of
sleep
last
night
dear
me
poor
thing
can
i
send
her
anything
if
you
could
let
them
have
a
little
black
currant
jelly
mrs
armstrong
would
be
so
thankful
she
has
so
much
to
think
of
and
is
so
weak
herself
poor
thing
she
has
time
to
make
those
things
indeed
i
will
mr
armstrong
i
send
it
down
this
morning
and
a
little
calf
foot
jelly
wo
hurt
her
it
is
in
the
house
and
mrs
armstrong
might
be
able
to
get
the
feet
you
know
give
them
my
love
and
if
i
can
get
out
at
all
i
go
and
see
them
and
so
the
parson
having
completed
his
domestic
embassy
for
the
benefit
of
his
sick
little
girl
followed
the
others
keen
for
the
hunt
and
the
three
ladies
were
left
alone
to
see
the
plate
and
china
put
away
xxii
the
hunt
though
the
majority
of
those
who
were
in
the
habit
of
hunting
with
the
kelly
court
hounds
had
been
at
the
breakfast
there
were
still
a
considerable
number
of
horsemen
waiting
on
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
house
when
frank
and
his
friends
sallied
forth
the
dogs
were
collected
round
the
huntsman
behaving
themselves
for
the
most
part
with
admirable
propriety
an
occasional
yelp
from
a
young
hound
would
now
and
then
prove
that
the
whipper
had
his
eye
on
them
and
would
not
allow
rambling
but
the
old
dogs
sat
demurely
on
their
haunches
waiting
the
signal
for
action
there
they
sat
as
grave
as
so
many
senators
with
their
large
heads
raised
their
heavy
lips
hanging
from
each
side
of
their
jaws
and
their
deep
strong
chests
expanded
so
as
to
show
fully
their

whipper
an
officer
of
the
hunt
whose
duty
was
to
help

hunstman

the
hounds
among
the
men
who
had
arrived
on
the
lawn
during
breakfast
were
two
who
certainly
had
not
come
together
and
who
had
not
spoken
since
they
had
been
there
they
were
martin
kelly
and
barry
lynch
martin
was
dressed
just
as
usual
except
that
he
had
on
a
pair
of
spurs
but
barry
was
armed
some
time
before
his
father
death
he
had
supplied
himself
with
all
the
fashionable
requisites
for
the
field
not
because
he
was
fond
of
hunting
for
he
was
not
but
in
order
to
prove
himself
as
much
a
gentleman
as
other
people
he
had
been
out
twice
this
year
but
had
felt
very
miserable
for
no
one
spoke
to
him
and
he
had
gone
home
on
both
occasions
early
in
the
day
but
he
had
now
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
show
himself
to
his
old
schoolfellow
in
his
new
character
as
an
independent
country
gentleman
and
what
was
more
he
was
determined
that
lord
ballindine
should
not
cut
him
footnote
from
head
to
foot
he
very
soon
had
an
opportunity
for
effecting
his
purpose
for
the
moment
that
frank
got
on
his
horse
he
unintentionally
rode
close
up
to
him
how
d
do
my
lord
i
hope
i
see
your
lordship
well
said
barry
with
a
clumsy
attempt
at
ease
and
familiarity
i
glad
to
find
your
lordship
in
the
field
before
the
season
over
good
morning
mr
lynch
said
frank
and
was
turning
away
from
him
when
remembering
that
he
must
have
come
from
dunmore
he
asked
did
you
see
martin
kelly
anywhere
ca
say
i
did
my
lord
said
barry
and
he
turned
away
completely
silenced
and
out
of
countenance
martin
had
been
talking
to
the
huntsman
and
criticizing
the
hounds
he
knew
every
dog
name
character
and
capabilities
and
also
every
horse
in
lord
ballindine
stable
and
was
consequently
held
in
great
respect
by
mick
keogh
and
his
crew
and
now
the
business
began
mick
said
the
lord
we
take
them
down
to
the
young
plantation
and
bring
them
back
through
the
firs
and
so
into
the
gorse
if
the
lad
lying
there
we
must
hit
him
that
way
that
thrue
for
yer
honer
my
lord
and
he
started
off
with
his
obedient
family
you
wrong
ballindine
said
the
parson
for
you
drive
him
up
into
the
big
plantation
and
you
be
all
day
before
you
make
him
break
and
ten
to
one
they
chop
him
in
the
cover
would
you
put
them
into
the
gorse
at
once
then
take
gently
through
the
firs
maybe
he
lying
out
and
down
into
the
gorse
and
then
if
he
there
he
must
go
away
and
into
a
country
too
miles
upon
miles
of
pasture
right
away
to
ballintubber
that
thrue
too
my
lord
let
his
rivirence
alone
for
understandhing
a
fox
said
mick
with
a
wink
the
parson
behests
were
obeyed
the
hounds
followed
mick
into
the
plantation
and
were
followed
by
two
or
three
of
the
more
eager
of
the
party
who
did
not
object
to
receiving
wet
boughs
in
their
faces
or
who
delighted
in
riding
for
half
an
hour
with
their
heads
bowed
close
down
over
their
the
rest
remained
with
the
whipper
outside
stay
a
moment
here
martin
said
lord
ballindine
they
ca
get
away
without
our
seeing
them
and
i
want
to
speak
a
few
words
to
you
and
i
want
particularly
to
spake
to
your
lordship
said
martin
and
there
no
fear
of
the
fox
i
never
knew
a
fox
lie
in
those
firs
yet
nor
i
either
but
you
see
the
parson
would
have
his
way
i
suppose
if
the
priest
were
out
and
he
told
you
to
run
the
dogs
through
the
you
do
it
i
blessed
if
i
would
my
lord
every
man
to
his
trade
not
but
what
mr
armstrong
knows
pretty
well
what
he
about
well
but
martin
i
tell
you
what
i
want
of
you
i
want
a
little
money
without
bothering
those
fellows
up
in
dublin
and
i
believe
you
could
let
me
have
it
at
any
rate
you
and
your
mother
together
those
fellows
at
guinness
are
stiff
about
it
and
i
want
three
hundred
pounds
without
absolutely
telling
them
that
they
must
give
it
me
give
you
my
bill
for
the
amount
at
twelve
months
and
allow
you
six
per
cent
but
then
i
want
it
immediately
can
you
let
me
have
it
why
my
lord
said
martin
after
pausing
awhile
and
looking
very
contemplative
during
the
time
i
certainly
have
the
money
that
is
i
and
mother
together
but
oh
if
you
any
doubt
about
it
or
if
it
puts
you
out
do
do
it
divil
a
doubt
on
my
lord
but
i
tell
you
i
was
just
going
to
ask
your
lordship
advice
about
laying
out
the
same
sum
in
another
way
and
i
do
think
i
could
raise
twice
that
much
very
well
martin
if
you
anything
better
to
do
with
your
money
i
sure
i
be
sorry
to
take
it
from
you
that
jist
it
my
lord
i
do
think
i
can
do
betther
but
i
want
your
advice
about
it
my
advice
whether
you
ought
to
lend
me
three
hundred
pounds
or
not
why
martin
you
a
fool
i
would
ask
you
to
lend
it
me
if
i
thought
you
ought
to
lend
it
oh
i
certain
sure
of
that
my
lord
but
there
an
offer
made
me
that
i
like
to
have
your
lordship
mind
about
it
not
much
to
my
liking
though
and
i
think
it
be
betther
for
me
to
be
giving
you
the
money
and
then
martin
told
his
landlord
the
offer
which
had
been
made
to
him
by
daly
on
the
part
of
barry
lynch
you
see
my
lord
he
concluded
by
saying
it
be
a
great
thing
to
be
shut
of
barry
entirely
out
of
the
counthry
and
to
have
poor
anty
mind
at
ase
about
it
should
she
iver
live
to
get
betther
but
thin
i
do
like
to
have
dailings
with
the
divil
or
any
one
so
much
of
his
colour
as
barry
lynch
this
is
a
very
grave
matter
martin
and
takes
some
little
time
to
think
about
to
tell
the
truth
i
forgot
your
matrimonial
speculation
when
i
asked
for
the
money
though
i
want
the
cash
i
think
you
should
keep
it
in
your
power
to
close
with
barry
no
you
better
keep
the
money
by
you
after
all
the
ould
woman
could
let
me
have
it
on
the
security
of
the
house
you
know
av
i
did
take
up
with
the
offer
so
any
way
your
lordship
need
be
balked
about
the
cash
but
is
miss
lynch
so
very
ill
martin
and
she
is
mr
frank
very
bad
intirely
doctor
colligan
was
with
her
three
times
yestherday
and
does
barry
take
any
notice
of
her
now
she
ill
why
not
yet
he
did
but
then
we
kept
it
from
him
as
much
as
we
could
till
it
got
dangerous
like
mother
manes
to
send
colligan
to
him
av
he
thinks
she
not
betther
if
she
were
to
die
martin
there
be
an
end
of
it
all
there
oh
in
course
there
would
my
lord
and
then
he
added
with
a
sigh
i
be
sorry
she
die
for
somehow
i
very
fond
of
her
quare
as
it
seem
to
you
i
be
very
sorry
she
should
die
of
course
you
would
martin
and
it
does
seem
queer
at
all
oh
i
was
thinking
about
the
money
then
my
lord
i
was
only
thinking
of
anty
herself
you
do
know
what
a
good
young
woman
she
is
it
anything
but
herself
she
thinking
of
always
did
she
make
any
will
deed
she
did
my
lord
nor
wo
it
my
mind
ah
but
she
should
after
all
that
you
and
your
mother
gone
through
it
be
a
thousand
pities
that
wretch
barry
got
all
the
property
again
he
wilcome
to
it
for
the
kellys
av
anty
dies
but
av
she
lives
he
shall
niver
rob
a
penny
from
her
oh
my
lord
we
would
put
sich
a
thing
as
a
will
into
her
head
and
she
so
bad
for
all
the
money
the
ould
man
their
father
iver
had
but
hark
my
lord
that
gaylass
i
know
the
note
well
and
she
as
true
as
gould
there
the
fox
there
just
inside
the
gorse
as
the
parson
said
and
away
they
both
trotted
to
the
bottom
of
the
plantation
from
whence
the
cheering
sound
of
the
dog
voices
came
sharp
sweet
and
mellow
yes
the
parson
was
as
right
as
if
he
had
been
let
into
the
confidence
overnight
and
had
betrayed
it
in
the
morning
gaylass
was
hardly
in
the
gorse
before
she
discovered
the
doomed
brute
vicinity
and
told
of
it
to
the
whole
canine
confraternity
away
from
his
he
went
towards
the
open
country
but
immediately
returned
into
the
covert
for
he
saw
a
lot
of
boys
before
him
who
had
assembled
with
the
object
of
looking
at
the
hunt
but
with
the
very
probable
effect
of
spoiling
it
for
as
much
as
a
fox
hates
a
dog
he
fears
the
human
race
more
and
will
run
from
an
urchin
with
a
stick
into
the
jaws
of
his
much
more
fatal
enemy
as
long
as
them
blackguards
is
there
a
hollowing
and
a
screeching
divil
a
fox
in
all
ireland
go
out
of
this
said
mick
to
his
master
ah
boys
said
frank
riding
up
if
you
want
to
see
a
hunt
will
you
keep
back
begorra
we
will
yer
honer
said
one
faix
we
would
be
afther
spiling
your
honer
divarsion
my
lord
on
no
account
said
another
we
be
out
o
this
althogether
now
this
blessed
minute
said
a
third
but
still
there
they
remained
each
loudly
endeavouring
to
banish
the
others
at
last
however
the
fox
saw
a
fair
course
before
him
and
away
he
went
and
with
very
little
start
for
the
dogs
followed
him
out
of
the
covert
almost
with
a
view
and
now
the
men
settled
themselves
to
the
work
and
began
to
strive
for
the
pride
of
place
at
least
the
younger
portion
of
them
for
in
every
field
there
are
two
classes
of
men
those
who
go
out
to
get
the
greatest
possible
quantity
of
riding
and
those
whose
object
is
to
get
the
least
those
who
go
to
work
their
nags
and
those
who
go
to
spare
them
the
former
think
that
the
excellence
of
the
hunt
depends
on
the
horses
the
latter
on
the
dogs
the
former
go
to
act
and
the
latter
to
see
and
it
is
very
generally
the
case
that
the
least
active
part
of
the
community
know
the
most
about
the
sport
they
the
less
active
part
above
alluded
to
know
every
and
they
consult
the
wind
and
calculate
that
a
fox
wo
run
with
his
nose
against
it
they
remember
this
stream
and
this
bog
and
avoid
them
they
are
often
at
the
top
of
eminences
and
only
descend
when
they
see
which
way
the
dogs
are
going
they
take
short
cuts
and
lay
themselves
out
for
narrow
lanes
they
dislike
galloping
and
eschew
leaping
and
yet
when
a
man
is
bringing
up
his
two
hundred
guinea
hunter
a
minute
or
two
late
for
the
finish
covered
with
foam
trembling
with
his
exertion
not
a
breath
left
in
him
he
probably
find
one
of
these
steady
fellows
there
before
him
mounted
on
a
screw
but
as
cool
and
as
fresh
as
when
he
was
brought
out
of
the
stable
and
what
is
perhaps
still
more
amazing
at
the
end
of
the
day
when
the
hunt
is
canvassed
after
dinner
our
dashing
friend
who
is
in
great
doubt
whether
his
thoroughbred
steeplechaser
will
ever
recover
his
day
work
and
who
has
been
personally
administering
warm
mashes
and
bandages
before
he
would
venture
to
take
his
own
boots
off
finds
he
does
not
know
half
as
much
about
the
hunt
or
can
tell
half
as
correctly
where
the
game
went
as
our
friend
whose
hack
will
probably
go
out
on
the
following
morning
under
the
car
with
the
mistress
and
children
such
a
one
was
parson
armstrong
and
when
lord
ballindine
and
most
of
the
others
went
away
after
the
hounds
he
coolly
turned
round
in
a
different
direction
crept
through
a
broken
wall
into
a
peasant
garden
and
over
a
dunghill
by
the
cabin
door
into
a
road
and
then
trotted
along
as
demurely
and
leisurely
as
though
he
were
going
to
bury
an
old
woman
in
the
next
parish
frank
was
generally
speaking
as
a
man
as
is
often
met
but
even
he
got
excited
and
irritable
when
hunting
his
own
pack
all
masters
of
hounds
do
some
one
was
always
too
forward
another
too
near
the
dogs
a
third
interfering
with
the
servants
and
a
fourth
making
too
much
noise
confound
it
peter
he
said
when
they
had
gone
over
a
field
or
two
and
the
dogs
missed
the
scent
for
a
moment
i
thought
at
any
rate
you
knew
better
than
to
cross
the
dogs
that
way
who
crossed
the
dogs
said
the
other
what
nonsense
you
talking
why
i
was
out
of
the
till
they
were
nearly
all
at
the
next
wall
well
it
may
be
nonsense
continued
frank
but
when
i
see
a
man
riding
right
through
the
hounds
and
they
hunting
i
call
that
crossing
them
hoicks
tally
hollowed
some
one
there
graceful
has
it
again
well
done
granger
faith
frank
that
a
good
dog
if
he
not
first
he
always
second
now
gentlemen
steady
for
heaven
sake
do
let
the
dogs
settle
to
their
work
before
you
of
them
upon
my
soul
nicholas
brown
it
ridiculous
to
see
you
it
be
a
good
thing
if
he
were
half
as
much
in
a
hurry
to
get
to
heaven
said
bingham
blake
said
nicholas
go
to
heaven
yourself
i
well
enough
where
i
am
and
now
they
were
off
again
in
the
next
field
the
whole
pack
caught
a
view
of
the
fox
just
as
he
was
stealing
out
and
after
him
they
went
with
their
noses
well
above
the
ground
their
voices
loud
and
clear
and
in
one
bevy
away
they
went
the
game
was
strong
the
scent
was
good
the
ground
was
soft
but
not
too
soft
and
a
magnificent
hunt
they
had
but
there
were
some
misfortunes
shortly
after
getting
away
barry
lynch
wishing
in
his
ignorance
to
lead
and
show
himself
off
and
not
knowing
how
scurrying
along
among
the
dogs
and
bothered
at
every
leap
had
given
great
offence
to
lord
ballindine
but
not
wishing
to
speak
severely
to
a
man
whom
he
would
not
under
any
circumstances
address
in
a
friendly
way
he
talked
at
him
and
endeavoured
to
bring
him
to
order
by
blowing
up
others
in
his
hearing
but
this
was
thrown
away
on
barry
and
he
continued
his
career
in
a
most
disgusting
manner
scrambling
through
gaps
together
with
the
dogs
crossing
other
men
without
the
slightest
reserve
annoying
every
one
and
evidently
pluming
himself
on
his
performance
frank
brow
was
getting
blacker
and
blacker
jerry
blake
and
young
brown
were
greatly
amusing
themselves
at
the
exhibition
and
every
now
and
then
gave
him
a
word
or
two
of
encouragement
praising
his
mare
telling
how
well
he
got
over
that
last
fence
and
bidding
him
mind
and
keep
well
forward
this
was
all
new
to
barry
and
he
really
began
to
feel
himself
in
his
element
if
it
had
been
for
those
abominable
walls
he
would
have
enjoyed
himself
but
this
was
too
good
to
last
and
before
very
long
he
made
a
which
brought
down
on
him
in
a
torrent
the
wrath
of
the
viscount
they
had
been
galloping
across
a
large
unbroken
which
exactly
suited
barry
taste
and
he
had
got
well
forward
towards
the
hounds
frank
was
behind
expostulating
with
jerry
blake
and
the
others
for
encouraging
him
when
the
dogs
came
to
a
small
stone
wall
about
two
feet
and
a
half
high
in
this
there
was
a
broken
gap
through
which
many
of
them
crept
barry
also
saw
this
happy
escape
from
the
grand
difficulty
of
jumping
and
ignorant
that
if
he
rode
the
gap
at
all
he
should
let
the
hounds
go
first
made
for
it
right
among
them
in
spite
of
frank
voice
now
raised
loudly
to
caution
him
the
horse
the
man
rode
knew
his
business
better
than
himself
and
tried
to
spare
the
dogs
which
were
under
his
feet
but
in
getting
out
he
made
a
slight
spring
and
came
down
on
the
haunches
of
a
favourite
young
hound
called
goneaway
he
broke
the
leg
close
to
the
socket
and
the
poor
beast
most
loudly
told
his
complaint
this
was
too
much
to
be
borne
and
frank
rode
up
red
with
passion
and
a
lot
of
others
including
the
whipper
soon
followed
he
has
killed
the
dog
said
he
did
you
ever
see
such
a
clumsy
ignorant
fool
mr
lynch
if
you
do
me
the
honour
to
stay
away
another
day
and
amuse
yourself
in
any
other
way
i
should
be
much
obliged
it
was
my
fault
then
said
barry
do
you
mean
to
give
me
the
lie
sir
replied
frank
the
dog
got
under
the
horse
feet
how
was
i
to
help
it
there
was
a
universal
titter
at
this
which
made
barry
wish
himself
at
home
again
with
his
ah
sir
said
frank
you
as
fit
to
ride
a
hunt
as
you
are
to
do
anything
else
which
gentlemen
usually
do
may
i
trouble
you
to
make
yourself
scarce
your
horse
i
see
ca
carry
you
much
farther
and
if
you
take
my
advice
you
go
home
before
you
ridden
over
yourself
well
martin
is
the
bone
broken
martin
had
got
off
his
horse
and
was
kneeling
down
beside
the
poor
hurt
brute
indeed
it
is
my
lord
in
two
places
you
better
let
tony
kill
him
he
has
an
awful
sprain
in
the
back
as
well
he
niver
put
a
foot
to
the
ground
again
by
heavens
that
too
bad
is
it
bingham
he
was
out
and
out
the
finest
puppy
we
entered
last
year
what
can
you
expect
said
bingham
when
such
fellows
as
that
come
into
a
field
he
as
much
business
here
as
a
cow
in
a
but
what
can
we
do
one
ca
turn
him
off
the
land
if
he
chooses
to
come
he
must
why
yes
said
bingham
if
he
will
come
he
must
but
then
if
he
insists
on
doing
so
he
may
be
horsewhipped
he
may
be
ridden
over
he
may
be
kicked
and
he
may
be
told
that
he
a
low
vulgar
paltry
scoundrel
and
if
he
repeats
his
visits
that
the
treatment
probably
receive
barry
was
close
to
both
the
speakers
and
of
course
heard
and
was
intended
to
hear
every
word
that
was
said
he
contented
himself
however
with
muttering
certain
inaudible
defiances
and
was
seen
and
heard
of
no
more
that
day
the
hunt
was
continued
and
the
fox
was
killed
but
frank
and
those
with
him
saw
but
little
more
of
it
however
as
soon
as
directions
were
given
for
the
death
of
poor
goneaway
they
went
on
and
received
a
very
satisfactory
account
of
the
proceedings
from
those
who
had
seen
the
finish
as
usual
the
parson
was
among
the
number
and
he
gave
them
a
most
detailed
history
not
only
of
the
fox
proceedings
during
the
day
but
also
of
all
the
reasons
which
actuated
the
animal
in
every
different
turn
he
took
i
declare
armstrong
said
peter
dillon
i
think
you
were
a
fox
yourself
once
do
you
remember
anything
about
it
what
a
run
he
would
give
said
jerry
the
best
pack
that
was
ever
kennelled
would
have
a
chance
with
him
who
was
that
old
chap
said
nicholas
dillon
showing
off
his
classical
learning
who
said
that
dead
animals
always
became
something
else
maybe
it
only
in
the
course
of
nature
for
a
dead
fox
to
become
a
live
parson
exactly
you
hit
it
said
armstrong
and
in
the
same
way
the
moment
the
breath
is
out
of
a
goose
it
becomes
an
idle
squireen
and
generally
speaking
a
younger
brother
footnote
squireen
diminutive
of
squire
a
minor
irish
gentleman
given
to
putting
on
airs
or
imitating
the
manners
and
haughtiness
of
men
of
greater
wealth
put
that
in
your
pipe
and
smoke
it
nick
said
jerry
and
take
care
how
you
meddle
with
the
church
again
who
saw
anything
of
lambert
brown
said
another
i
left
him
bogged
below
there
at
gurtnascreenagh
and
all
he
could
do
the
old
grey
horse
would
move
a
leg
to
get
out
for
him
oh
he
there
still
said
nicholas
he
was
trying
to
follow
me
and
i
took
him
there
on
purpose
it
not
deep
and
he
do
no
hurt
keep
as
well
there
as
anywhere
else
nonsense
dillon
said
the
general
you
make
his
brother
really
angry
if
you
go
on
that
way
if
the
man
a
fool
leave
him
in
his
folly
but
do
be
playing
tricks
on
him
you
only
get
yourself
into
a
quarrel
with
the
family
and
how
shall
we
manage
about
the
money
my
lord
said
martin
as
he
drew
near
the
point
at
which
he
would
separate
from
the
rest
to
ride
towards
dunmore
i
been
thinking
about
it
and
there
no
doubt
about
having
it
for
you
on
friday
av
that
suit
that
of
yours
is
a
most
unmitigated
blackguard
he
martin
said
frank
who
was
thinking
more
about
poor
goneaway
than
the
money
he
is
no
of
mine
yet
and
probably
niver
will
be
for
i
afeard
poor
anty
go
but
av
he
iver
is
he
soon
take
himself
out
of
the
counthry
and
be
no
more
throuble
to
your
lordship
or
any
of
us
but
to
think
of
his
riding
right
of
the
poor
brute
and
then
saying
that
the
dog
got
under
his
horse
feet
why
he
a
fool
as
well
as
a
knave
was
he
ever
out
before
well
then
i
believe
he
was
twice
this
year
though
i
did
see
him
myself
then
i
hope
this
be
the
last
time
three
times
is
quite
enough
for
such
a
fellow
as
that
i
do
think
he
be
apt
to
show
again
afther
what
you
and
mr
bingham
said
to
him
well
shure
mr
bingham
was
very
hard
on
him
serve
him
right
nothing
too
bad
for
him
oh
that
thrue
for
you
my
lord
i
do
pity
him
one
bit
but
about
the
money
and
this
job
of
my
own
av
it
was
asking
too
much
be
a
great
thing
av
your
lordship
see
daly
it
was
then
settled
that
lord
ballindine
should
ride
over
to
dunmore
on
the
following
friday
and
if
circumstances
seemed
to
render
it
advisable
that
he
and
martin
should
go
on
together
to
the
attorney
at
tuam
xxiii
doctor
colligan
doctor
colligan
the
galen
of
dunmore
though
a
practitioner
of
most
unprepossessing
appearance
and
demeanour
was
neither
ignorant
nor
careless
though
for
many
years
he
had
courted
the
public
in
vain
his
neighbours
had
at
last
learned
to
know
and
appreciate
him
and
at
the
time
of
anty
illness
the
inhabitants
of
three
parishes
trusted
their
corporeal
ailments
to
his
care
with
comfort
to
themselves
and
profit
to
him
nevertheless
there
were
many
things
about
doctor
colligan
not
calculated
to
inspire
either
respect
or
confidence
he
always
seemed
a
little
afraid
of
his
patient
and
very
much
afraid
of
his
friends
he
was
always
dreading
the
appearance
at
dunmore
of
one
of
those
young
rivals
who
had
lately
established
themselves
at
tuam
on
one
side
and
hollymount
on
the
other
and
to
prevent
so
fatal
a
circumstance
was
continually
trying
to
be
civil
and
obliging
to
his
customers
he
would
not
put
on
a
blister
or
order
a
black
dose
without
consulting
with
the
lady
of
the
house
and
asking
permission
of
the
patient
and
consequently
had
always
an
air
of
doubt
and
indecision
then
he
was
excessively
dirty
in
his
person
and
practice
he
carried
a
considerable
territory
beneath
his
nails
smelt
equally
strongly
of
the
laboratory
and
the
stable
would
wipe
his
hands
on
the
patient
sheets
and
wherever
he
went
left
horrid
marks
of
his
whereabouts
he
was
very
fond
of
good
eating
and
much
drinking
and
would
neglect
the
best
customer
that
ever
was
sick
when
tempted
by
the
fascination
of
a
game
of
loo
he
was
certainly
a
bad
for
though
he
worked
hard
for
the
support
of
his
wife
and
children
he
was
little
among
them
paid
them
no
attention
and
felt
no
scruple
in
assuring
mrs
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
remain
up
all
night
with
that
dreadful
mrs
jones
whose
children
were
always
so
tedious
or
that
mr
blake
was
so
bad
after
his
accident
that
he
could
not
leave
him
for
a
moment
when
to
tell
the
truth
the
doctor
had
passed
the
night
with
the
cards
in
his
hands
and
a
tumbler
of
punch
beside
him
he
was
a
tall
heavy
man
with
short
black
curly
hair
was
a
little
bald
at
the
top
of
his
head
and
looked
always
as
though
he
had
shaved
himself
the
day
before
yesterday
and
had
not
washed
since
his
face
was
but
heavy
and
unintellectual
he
was
ignorant
of
everything
but
his
profession
and
the
odds
on
the
or
the
but
to
give
him
his
due
on
these
subjects
he
was
not
ignorant
and
this
was
now
so
generally
known
that
in
dangerous
cases
doctor
colligan
had
been
sent
for
many
many
miles
this
was
the
man
who
attended
poor
anty
in
her
illness
and
he
did
as
much
for
her
as
could
be
done
but
it
was
a
bad
case
and
doctor
colligan
thought
it
would
be
fatal
she
had
intermittent
fever
and
was
occasionally
delirious
but
it
was
her
great
debility
between
the
attacks
which
he
considered
so
dangerous
on
the
morning
after
the
hunt
he
told
martin
that
he
greatly
feared
she
would
go
off
from
exhaustion
in
a
few
days
and
that
it
would
be
wise
to
let
barry
know
the
state
in
which
his
sister
was
there
was
a
consultation
on
the
subject
between
the
two
and
martin
mother
in
which
it
was
agreed
that
the
doctor
should
go
up
to
dunmore
house
and
tell
barry
exactly
the
state
of
affairs
and
good
news
it
be
for
him
said
mrs
kelly
the
best
he
heard
since
the
ould
man
died
av
he
had
his
will
of
her
she
niver
rise
from
the
bed
where
she
stretched
but
glory
be
to
god
there
a
providence
over
all
and
maybe
she
live
yet
to
give
him
the
how
you
talk
mother
said
martin
and
what
the
use
whatever
he
wishes
wo
harum
her
and
maybe
now
she
dying
his
heart
be
softened
to
her
any
way
do
let
him
have
to
say
she
died
here
without
his
hearing
a
word
how
bad
she
was
maybe
he
be
afther
saying
we
murdhered
her
for
her
money
said
the
widow
with
a
shudder
he
can
hardly
complain
of
that
when
he
be
getting
all
the
money
himself
but
however
it
much
betther
all
ways
that
doctor
colligan
should
see
him
you
know
mrs
kelly
said
the
doctor
as
a
matter
of
course
he
be
asking
to
see
his
sister
you
would

martin

in
the
widow
being
sent
into
anty
room
to
ask
her
whether
she
had
any
message
to
send
to
her
brother
the
poor
girl
knew
how
ill
she
was
and
expected
her
death
and
when
the
widow
told
her
that
doctor
colligan
was
going
to
call
on
her
brother
she
said
that
she
hoped
she

my
words
else
och
musha
musha
i
do
at
all
faix
forty
pounds
wo
clear
what
this
turn
is
like
to
come
to
an
all
from
your
dirthy
undherhand
schaming
ways
in
truth
the
widow
was
perplexed
in
her
inmost
soul
about
anty
torn
and
tortured
by
doubts
and
anxieties
her
real
love
of
anty
and
true
charity
was
in
state
of
battle
with
her
parsimony
and
then
avarice
was
strong
within
her
and
utter
uncontrolled
hatred
of
barry
still
stronger
but
opposed
to
these
was
dread
of
some
unforeseen
evil
some
tremendous
law
proceedings
she
had
a
idea
that
she
was
doing
what
she
had
no
right
to
do
and
that
she
might
some
day
be
walked
off
to
galway
assizes
then
again
she
had
an
absurd
pride
about
it
which
often
made
her
declare
that
she
never
be
beat
by
such
a
scum
of
the
as
barry
lynch
and
that
she
fight
it
out
with
him
if
it
cost
her
a
hundred
pounds
though
no
one
understood
what
the
battle
was
which
she
was
to
fight
just
before
anty
illness
had
become
so
serious
daly
called
and
had
succeeded
in
reconciling
both
martin
and
the
widow
to
himself
but
he
had
not
quite
made
them
agree
to
his
proposal
the
widow
indeed
was
much
averse
to
it
she
would
deal
with
such
a
greek
as
barry
even
in
the
acceptance
of
a
boon
when
she
found
him
willing
to
compromise
she
became
more
than
ever
averse
to
any
friendly
terms
but
now
the
whole
ground
was
slipping
from
under
her
feet
anty
was
dying
she
would
have
had
her
trouble
for
nothing
and
that
hated
barry
would
gain
his
point
and
the
whole
of
his
sister
property
in
triumph
twenty
times
the
idea
of
a
will
had
come
into
her
mind
and
how
comfortable
it
would
be
if
anty
would
leave
her
property
or
at
any
rate
a
portion
of
it
to
martin
but
though
the
thoughts
of
such
a
delightful
arrangement
kept
her
in
a
continual
whirlwind
of
anxiety
she
never
hinted
at
the
subject
to
anty
as
she
said
to
herself
a
kelly
would
demane
herself
to
ask
a
brass
penny
from
a
lynch
she
did
even
speak
to
her
daughters
about
it
though
the
continual
twitter
she
was
in
made
them
aware
that
there
was
some
unusual
burthen
on
her
mind
it
was
not
only
to
the
kellys
that
the
idea
occurred
that
anty
in
her
illness
might
make
a
will
the
thoughts
of
such
a
catastrophe
had
robbed
barry
of
half
the
pleasure
which
the
rumours
of
his
dangerous
position
had
given
him
he
had
not
received
any
direct
intimation
of
anty
state
but
had
heard
through
the
servants
that
she
was
ill
very
ill
dangerously
not
expected
as
the
country
people
call
it
and
each
fresh
rumour
gave
him
new
hopes
and
new
life
he
now
spurned
all
idea
of
connexion
with
martin
he
would
trample
on
the
kellys
for
thinking
of
such
a
thing
he
would
show
daly
when
in
the
plenitude
of
his
wealth
and
power
how
he
despised
the
lukewarmness
and
timidity
of
his
councils
these
and
other
delightful
visions
were
floating
through
his
imagination
when
all
of
a
sudden
like
a
blow
like
a
thunderbolt
the
idea
of
fell
as
it
were
upon
him
with
a
ton
weight
his
heart
sunk
low
within
him
he
became
white
and
his
jaw
dropped
after
all
there
were
victory
and
triumph
plunder
and
wealth
wealth
in
the
very
hands
of
his
enemies
of
course
the
kellys
would
force
her
to
make
a
will
if
she
did
do
it
of
her
own
accord
if
not
they
forge
one
there
was
some
comfort
in
that
thought
he
could
at
any
rate
contest
the
will
and
swear
that
it
was
a
forgery
he
swallowed
a
dram
and
went
off
almost
weeping
to
daly
oh
mr
daly
poor
anty
dying
did
you
hear
mr
daly
she
all
but
gone
yes
daly
had
been
sorry
to
hear
that
miss
lynch
was
very
what
shall
i
do
continued
barry
if
they
say
that
she
left
a
will
go
and
hear
it
read
or
if
you
do
like
to
do
that
yourself
stay
away
and
let
me
hear
it
but
they
forge
one
they
make
out
what
they
please
and
when
she
dying
they
make
her
put
her
name
to
it
or
they
only
just
put
the
pen
in
her
hand
when
she
not
knowing
what
she
doing
they
do
anything
now
daly
to
get
the
money
they
been
fighting
for
so
hard
it
my
belief
answered
the
attorney
that
the
kellys
not
only
wo
do
anything
dishonest
but
that
they
wo
even
take
any
unfair
advantage
of
you
but
at
any
rate
you
can
do
nothing
you
must
wait
patiently
you
at
any
rate
can
take
no
steps
till
she
dead
but
could
she
make
a
will
in
my
favour
i
know
she
do
it
if
i
asked
her
if
i
asked
her
now
now
she
going
off
you
know
i
sure
she
do
it
do
you
think
she
would
you
safer
i
think
to
let
it
alone
said
daly
who
could
hardly
control
the
ineffable
disgust
he
felt
i
do
know
that
continued
barry
she
weak
and
do
what
she
asked
besides
make
her
do
it
fancy
if
when
gone
i
find
i
have
to
share
everything
with
those
people
and
he
struck
his
forehead
and
pushed
the
hair
off
his
perspiring
face
as
he
literally
shook
with
despair
i
must
see
her
daly
i
quite
sure
she
make
a
will
if
i
beg
her
they
ca
hinder
me
seeing
my
own
only
dying
sister
can
they
daly
and
when
i
once
there
i
sit
with
her
and
watch
till
it
all
over
i
sure
now
she
ill
i
do
anything
for
her
daly
said
nothing
though
barry
paused
for
him
to
reply
only
about
the
form
continued
he
i
would
know
what
to
put
by
heavens
daly
you
must
come
with
me
you
can
be
up
at
the
house
and
i
can
have
you
down
at
a
minute
warning
daly
utterly
declined
but
barry
continued
to
press
him
but
you
must
daly
i
tell
you
i
know
right
i
know
her
so
well
she
do
it
at
once
for
the
sake
for
the
sake
of
you
know
she
is
my
own
sister
and
all
that
and
she
thinks
so
much
of
that
kind
of
thing
i
tell
you
what
daly
upon
my
honour
and
soul
and
he
repeated
the
words
in
a
most
solemn
tone
if
draw
the
will
and
she
signs
it
so
that
i
come
in
for
the
whole
thing
and
i
know
she
will
i
make
over
fifty
ay
seventy
pounds
a
year
for
you
for
ever
and
ever
i
will
as
i
live
the
interview
ended
by
the
attorney
turning
barry
lynch
into
the
street
and
assuring
him
that
if
he
ever
came
into
his
office
again
on
any
business
whatsoever
he
would
unscrupulously
kick
him
out
so
ended
also
the
connexion
between
the
two
for
daly
never
got
a
farthing
for
his
labour
indeed
after
all
that
had
taken
place
he
thought
it
as
well
not
to
trouble
his
client
with
a
bill
barry
went
home
and
of
course
got
drunk
when
doctor
colligan
called
on
lynch
he
found
that
he
was
not
at
home
he
was
at
that
very
moment
at
tuam
with
the
attorney
the
doctor
repeated
his
visit
later
in
the
afternoon
but
barry
had
still
not
returned
and
he
therefore
left
word
that
he
would
call
early
after
breakfast
the
following
morning
he
did
so
and
after
waiting
half
an
hour
in
the
barry
only
half
awake
and
half
dressed
and
still
half
drunk
came
down
to
him
the
doctor
with
a
long
face
delivered
his
message
and
explained
to
him
the
state
in
which
his
sister
was
lying
assured
him
that
everything
in
the
power
of
medicine
had
been
and
should
be
done
that
nevertheless
he
feared
the
chance
of
recovery
was
remote
and
ended
by
informing
him
that
miss
lynch
was
aware
of
her
danger
and
had
expressed
a
wish
to
see
him
before
it
might
be
too
late
could
he
make
it
convenient
to
come
over
just
now
in
half
an
hour
or
say
an
hour
said
the
doctor
looking
at
the
red
face
and
unfinished
toilet
of
the
distressed
brother
barry
at
first
scarcely
knew
what
reply
to
give
on
his
return
from
tuam
he
had
determined
that
he
would
at
any
rate
make
his
way
into
his
sister
room
and
as
he
thought
to
himself
see
what
would
come
of
it
in
his
courage
he
had
further
determined
that
he
would
treat
the
widow
and
her
family
with
a
very
high
hand
if
they
dared
to
make
objection
to
his
seeing
his
sister
but
now
when
the
friendly
overture
came
from
anty
herself
and
was
brought
by
one
of
the
kelly
faction
he
felt
himself
a
little
confounded
as
though
he
rather
dreaded
the
interview
and
would
wish
to
put
it
off
for
a
day
or
two
oh
yes
certainly
doctor
colligan
to
be
sure
that
is
tell
me
doctor
is
she
really
so
bad
indeed
mr
lynch
she
is
very
weak
but
doctor
you
do
think
there
is
any
chance
i
mean
there
any
danger
is
there
that
she
go
off
at
once
why
no
i
do
think
there
is
indeed
i
have
no
doubt
she
will
hold
out
a
fortnight
yet
then
perhaps
doctor
i
better
put
it
off
till
i
tell
you
why
there
a
person
i
wish
why
mr
lynch
would
be
better
the
fever
periodical
you
see
and
will
be
on
her
again
i
beg
your
pardon
doctor
colligan
said
barry
of
a
sudden
remembering
to
be
civil
but
you
take
a
glass
of
wine
not
a
drop
thank
ye
of
anything
oh
but
you
will
and
barry
rang
the
bell
and
had
the
wine
brought
and
you
expect
she
have
another
attack
that
a
matter
of
course
mr
lynch
the
fever
come
on
her
again
every
attack
leaves
her
weaker
and
weaker
and
we
fear
she
go
off
before
it
leaves
her
altogether
poor
thing
said
barry
contemplatively
we
had
her
head
shaved
said
the
doctor
did
you
indeed
answered
barry
she
was
my
favourite
sister
doctor
colligan
that
is
i
had
no
other
i
believe
not
said
doctor
colligan
looking
sympathetic
take
another
glass
of
wine
doctor
now
do
and
he
poured
out
another
bumper
mr
lynch
not
a
drop
more
and
you
be
over
in
an
hour
then
i
better
go
and
tell
her
that
she
may
be
prepared
you
know
and
the
doctor
returned
to
the
sick
room
of
his
patient
barry
remained
standing
in
the
parlour
looking
at
the
glasses
and
the
decanter
as
though
he
were
speculating
on
the
manner
in
which
they
had
been
fabricated
she
may
recover
after
all
thought
he
to
himself
she
as
strong
as
a
horse
i
know
her
better
than
they
do
i
know
she
recover
and
then
what
shall
i
do
stand
to
the
offer
daly
made
to
kelly
i
suppose
and
then
he
sat
down
close
to
the
table
with
his
elbow
on
it
and
his
chin
resting
on
his
hand
and
there
he
remained
full
of
thought
to
tell
the
truth
barry
lynch
had
never
thought
more
intensely
than
he
did
during
those
ten
minutes
at
last
he
jumped
up
suddenly
as
though
surprised
at
what
had
been
passing
within
himself
he
looked
hastily
at
the
door
and
at
the
window
as
though
to
see
that
he
had
not
been
watched
and
then
went
upstairs
to
dress
himself
preparatory
to
his
visit
to
the
inn
xxiv
anty
lynch
scene
the
first
anty
had
borne
her
illness
with
that
patience
and
endurance
which
were
so
particularly
inherent
in
her
nature
she
had
never
complained
and
had
received
the
untiring
attentions
and
care
of
her
two
young
friends
with
a
warmth
of
affection
and
gratitude
which
astonished
them
accustomed
as
they
had
been
in
every
little
illness
to
give
and
receive
that
tender
care
with
which
sickness
is
treated
in
affectionate
families
when
ill
they
felt
they
had
a
right
to
be
petulant
and
to
complain
to
exact
and
to
be
attended
to
they
had
been
used
to
it
from
each
other
and
thought
it
an
incidental
part
of
the
business
but
anty
had
hitherto
had
no
one
to
nurse
her
and
she
looked
on
meg
and
jane
as
kind
ministering
angels
emulous
as
they
were
to
relieve
her
wants
and
ease
her
sufferings
her
thin
face
had
become
thinner
and
was
very
pale
her
head
had
been
shaved
close
and
there
was
nothing
between
the
broad
white
border
of
her
nightcap
and
her
clammy
brow
and
wan
cheek
but
illness
was
more
becoming
to
anty
than
health
it
gave
her
a
melancholy
and
beautiful
expression
of
resignation
which
under
ordinary
circumstances
was
wanting
to
her
features
though
not
to
her
character
her
eyes
were
brighter
than
they
usually
were
and
her
complexion
was
clear
colourless
and
transparent
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
anty
in
her
illness
was
beautiful
but
she
was
no
longer
plain
and
even
to
the
young
kellys
whose
feelings
and
sympathies
can
not
be
supposed
to
have
been
of
the

that

to

that
blagguard
of
a
brother
of
hers
into
the
house
and
that
as
a
frind
like
is
what
i
did
think
i
ever
have
put
upon
me
barry
made
his
appearance
about
an
hour
after
the
time
at
which
they
had
begun
to
expect
him
and
as
soon
as
meg
saw
him
one
of
them
flew
upstairs
to
tell
anty
and
give
her
her
tonic
barry
had
made
himself
quite
a
dandy
to
do
honour
to
the
occasion
of
paying
probably
a
parting
visit
to
his
sister
whom
he
had
driven
out
of
her
own
house
to
die
at
the
inn
he
had
on
his
new
blue
and
a
buff
waistcoat
with
gilt
buttons
over
which
his
was
gracefully
arranged
his
pantaloons
were
strapped
clown
very
tightly
over
his
polished
boots
a
shining
new
silk
hat
was
on
one
side
of
his
head
and
in
his
hand
he
was
dangling
an
ebony
cane
in
spite
however
of
all
these
gaudy
trappings
he
could
not
muster
up
an
easy
air
and
as
he
knocked
he
had
that
look
proverbially
attributed
to
dogs
who
are
going
to
be
hung
sally
opened
the
door
for
him
and
the
widow
who
had
come
out
from
the
shop
made
him
a
low
courtesy
in
the
passage
oh
ah
yes
mrs
kelly
i
believe
said
barry
yes
mr
lynch
that
my
name
glory
be
to
god
my
sister
miss
lynch
is
still
staying
here
i
believe
why
drat
it
man
was
dr
colligan
with
you
less
than
an
hour
ago
telling
you
you
must
come
here
av
you
wanted
to
see
her
you
oblige
me
by
sending
up
the
servant
to
tell
miss
lynch
here
walk
up
here
a
minute
and
i
do
that
errand
for
you
well
continued
she
muttering
to
herself
for
him
to
ax
av
she
war
staying
here
as
though
he
did
know
it
there
niver
was
his
ditto
for
desait
maneness
and
divilry
a
minute
or
two
after
the
widow
had
left
him
barry
found
himself
by
his
sister
but
never
had
he
found
himself
in
a
position
for
which
he
was
less
fitted
or
which
was
less
easy
to
him
he
assumed
however
a
long
and
solemn
face
and
crawling
up
to
the
told
his
sister
in
a
whining
voice
that
he
was
very
glad
to
see
her
sit
down
barry
sit
down
said
anty
stretching
out
her
thin
pale
hand
and
taking
hold
of
her
brother
barry
did
as
he
was
told
and
sat
down
i
so
glad
to
see
you
barry
said
she
i
so
very
glad
to
see
you
once
more
and
then
after
a
pause
and
it
be
the
last
time
barry
for
i
dying
barry
told
her
he
did
think
she
was
for
he
did
know
when
seen
her
looking
better
yes
i
am
barry
doctor
colligan
has
said
as
much
and
i
should
know
it
well
enough
myself
even
if
he
never
said
a
word
we
friends
now
are
we
not
everything
forgiven
and
forgotten
is
it
barry
anty
had
still
hold
of
her
brother
hand
and
seemed
desirous
to
keep
it
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
with
his
knees
tucked
in
against
the
bed
the
very
picture
of
discomfort
both
of
body
and
mind
oh
of
course
it
is
anty
said
he
forgive
and
forget
that
was
always
my
motto
i
sure
i
never
bore
any
malice
indeed
i
never
was
so
sorry
as
when
you
went
away
and
ah
barry
said
anty
it
was
better
i
went
then
it
all
better
as
it
is
when
the
priest
has
been
with
me
and
given
me
comfort
i
wo
fear
to
die
but
there
are
other
things
barry
i
want
to
spake
to
you
about
if
there
anything
i
can
do
i
sure
i
do
it
if
there
anything
at
all
you
wish
would
you
like
to
come
up
to
the
house
again
oh
no
barry
not
for
worlds
why
perhaps
just
at
present
you
are
too
weak
to
move
only
it
be
more
comfortable
for
you
to
be
in
your
own
house
these
people
here
are
all
very
well
i
dare
say
but
they
must
be
a
great
bother
to
you
eh
so
interested
you
know
in
everything
they
do
ah
barry
you
do
know
them
barry
remembered
that
he
would
be
on
the
wrong
tack
to
abuse
the
kellys
i
sure
they
very
nice
people
said
he
indeed
i
always
thought
so
and
said
so
but
they
not
like
your
own
flesh
and
blood
are
they
anty
and
why
should
you
come
up
and
be
no
barry
said
she
i
not
do
that
as
they
so
very
very
kind
as
to
let
me
stay
here
i
remain
till
till
god
takes
me
to
himself
but
they
not
my
flesh
and
blood
and
she
turned
round
and
looked
affectionately
in
the
face
of
her
brother
there
are
only
the
two
of
us
left
now
and
soon
very
soon
you
be
all
alone
barry
felt
very
uncomfortable
and
wished
the
interview
was
over
he
tried
to
say
something
but
failed
and
anty
went
on
when
that
time
comes
will
you
remember
what
i
say
to
you
now
when
you
all
alone
barry
when
there
nothing
left
to
trouble
you
or
put
you
out
will
you
think
then
of
the
last
time
you
ever
saw
your
sister
and
oh
anty
sure
i
be
seeing
you
again
no
barry
never
again
this
is
the
last
time
we
shall
ever
meet
and
think
how
much
we
ought
to
be
to
each
other
we
neither
of
us
father
or
mother
husband
or
when
i
gone
you
be
alone
will
you
think
of
me
then
and
will
you
remember
remember
every
day
what
i
say
to
you
now
indeed
i
will
anty
i
do
anything
everything
you
have
me
is
there
anything
you
wish
me
to
give
to
any
person
barry
she
continued
no
good
ever
came
of
my
father
will
barry
almost
jumped
off
his
chair
as
he
heard
his
sister
words
so
much
did
they
startle
him
but
he
said
the
money
has
done
me
no
good
but
the
loss
of
it
has
blackened
your
heart
and
turned
your
blood
to
gall
against
me
yes
barry
yes
do
speak
now
let
me
go
on
the
old
man
brought
you
up
to
look
for
it
and
alas
he
taught
you
to
look
for
nothing
else
it
has
not
been
your
fault
and
i
not
blaming
you
i
not
maning
to
blame
you
my
own
brother
for
you
are
my
own
and
she
turned
round
in
the
bed
and
shed
tears
upon
his
hand
and
kissed
but
gold
and
land
will
never
make
you
happy
no
not
all
the
gold
of
england
nor
all
the
land
the
old
kings
ever
had
could
make
you
happy
av
the
heart
was
bad
within
you
you
have
it
all
now
barry
or
mostly
all
you
have
what
you
think
the
old
man
wronged
you
of
you
have
it
with
no
one
to
provide
for
but
yourself
with
no
one
to
trouble
you
no
one
to
thwart
you
but
oh
barry
av
it
in
your
heart
that
that
can
make
you
happy
there
nothing
before
you
but
misery
and
death
and
hell
barry
shook
like
a
child
in
the
clutches
of
its
master
yes
barry
misery
and
death
and
all
the
tortures
of
the
damned
it
to
save
you
from
this
my
own
brother
to
try
and
turn
your
heart
from
that
foul
love
of
money
that
your
sister
is
now
speaking
to
you
from
her
oh
barry
try
and
cure
it
learn
to
give
to
others
and
you
enjoy
what
you
have
learn
to
love
others
and
then
you
know
what
it
is
to
be
loved
yourself
try
try
to
soften
that
hard
heart
marry
at
once
barry
at
once
before
you
older
and
worse
to
cure
and
you
have
children
and
love
them
and
when
you
feel
as
feel
you
must
that
the
money
is
clinging
round
your
soul
fling
it
from
you
and
think
of
the
last
words
your
sister
said
to
you
the
sweat
was
now
running
down
the
cheeks
of
the
wretched
man
for
the
mixed
rebuke
and
prayer
of
his
sister
had
come
home
to
him
and
touched
him
but
it
was
neither
with
pity
with
remorse
nor
penitence
no
in
that
foul
heart
there
was
no
room
even
for
remorse
but
he
trembled
with
fear
as
he
listened
to
her
words
and
falling
on
his
knees
swore
to
her
that
he
would
do
just
as
she
would
have
him
if
i
could
but
think
continued
she
that
you
would
remember
what
i
am
saying
oh
i
will
anty
i
will
indeed
indeed
i
will
if
i
could
believe
so
barry
i
die
happy
and
in
comfort
for
i
love
you
better
than
anything
on
earth
and
again
she
pressed
his
hot
red
hand
but
oh
brother
i
feel
for
you
you
never
kneel
before
the
altar
of
god
you
no
priest
to
move
the
weight
of
sin
from
your
soul
and
how
heavy
that
must
be
do
you
remember
barry
it
but
a
week
or
two
ago
and
you
threatened
to
kill
me
for
the
sake
of
our
father
money
you
wanted
to
put
me
in
a
you
tried
to
make
me
mad
with
fear
and
cruelty
me
your
sister
and
i
never
harmed
or
crossed
you
god
is
now
doing
what
you
threatened
a
kind
good
god
is
now
taking
me
to
himself
and
you
will
get
what
you
so
longed
for
without
more
sin
on
your
conscience
but
it
never
bless
you
av
you
still
the
same
wishes
in
your
heart
the
same
love
of
gold
the
same
hatred
of
a
oh
anty
sobbed
out
barry
who
was
now
absolutely
in
tears
i
was
drunk
that
night
i
was
indeed
or
i
never
have
said
or
done
what
i
did
and
how
often
are
you
so
barry
is
it
so
with
you
every
night
that
another
thing
for
my
sake
for
your
own
sake
for
god
sake
give
up
the
dhrink
it
killing
you
from
day
to
day
and
hour
to
hour
i
see
it
in
your
eyes
and
smell
it
in
your
breath
and
hear
it
in
your
voice
it
that
that
makes
your
heart
so
black
it
that
that
gives
you
over
body
and
soul
to
the
devil
i
would
not
have
said
a
word
about
that
night
to
hurt
you
now
and
dear
barry
i
would
have
said
such
words
as
these
to
you
at
all
but
that
i
shall
never
speak
to
you
again
and
oh
i
pray
that
you
remember
them
you
idle
now
always
do
continue
so
earn
your
money
and
it
will
be
a
blessing
to
you
and
to
others
but
in
idleness
and
drunkenness
and
wickedness
it
will
only
lead
you
quicker
to
the
devil
barry
reiterated
his
promises
he
would
take
the
pledge
he
would
work
at
the
farm
he
would
marry
and
have
a
family
he
would
not
care
the
least
for
money
he
would
pay
his
debts
he
would
go
to
church
or
chapel
if
anty
liked
it
better
at
any
rate
he
say
his
prayers
he
would
remember
every
word
she
had
said
to
the
last
day
of
his
life
he
promised
everything
or
anything
as
though
his
future
existence
depended
on
his
appeasing
his
dying
sister
but
during
the
whole
time
his
chief
wish
his
longing
desire
was
to
finish
the
interview
and
get
out
of
that
horrid
room
he
felt
that
he
was
mastered
and
cowed
by
the
creature
whom
he
had
so
despised
and
he
could
not
account
for
the
feeling
why
did
he
not
dare
to
answer
her
she
had
told
him
he
would
have
her
money
she
had
said
it
would
come
to
him
as
a
matter
of
course
and
it
was
not
the
dread
of
losing
that
which
prevented
his
saying
a
word
in
his
own
defence
no
she
had
really
frightened
him
she
had
made
him
really
feel
that
he
was
a
low
wretched
wicked
creature
and
he
longed
to
escape
from
her
that
he
might
recover
his
composure
i
have
but
little
more
to
say
to
you
barry
she
continued
and
that
little
is
about
the
property
you
will
have
it
all
but
a
small
sum
of
money
here
anty
was
interrupted
by
a
knock
at
the
door
and
the
entrance
of
the
widow
she
came
to
say
that
the
quarter
of
an
hour
allowed
by
the
doctor
had
been
long
exceeded
and
that
really
mr
barry
ought
to
take
his
leave
as
so
much
talking
would
be
bad
for
anty
this
was
quite
a
for
barry
who
was
only
anxious
to
be
off
but
anty
begged
for
a
respite
one
five
minutes
longer
dear
mrs
kelly
said
she
and
i
shall
have
done
only
five
minutes
i
much
stronger
now
and
really
it
hurt
me
well
then
mind
only
five
minutes
said
the
widow
and
again
left
them
alone
you
do
know
barry
you
can
never
know
how
good
that
woman
has
been
to
me
indeed
all
of
them
and
all
for
nothing
they
asked
nothing
of
me
and
now
that
they
know
i
dying
i
sure
they
expect
nothing
from
me
she
has
enough
but
i
wish
to
leave
something
to
martin
and
the
girls
and
a
slight
pale
blush
covered
her
wan
cheeks
and
forehead
as
she
mentioned
martin
name
i
will
leave
him
five
hundred
pounds
and
them
the
same
between
them
it
will
be
nothing
to
you
barry
out
of
the
whole
but
see
and
pay
it
at
once
will
you
and
she
looked
kindly
into
his
face
he
promised
vehemently
that
he
would
and
told
her
not
to
bother
herself
about
a
will
they
should
have
the
money
as
certainly
as
if
twenty
wills
were
made
to
give
barry
his
due
at
that
moment
he
meant
to
be
as
good
as
his
word
anty
however
told
him
that
she
would
make
a
will
that
she
would
send
for
a
lawyer
and
have
the
matter
properly
settled
and
now
she
said
dear
barry
may
god
almighty
bless
you
may
he
guide
you
and
preserve
you
and
may
he
above
all
take
from
you
that
horrid
love
of
the
world
gold
and
wealth
good
bye
and
she
raised
herself
up
in
her
bed
good
bye
for
the
last
time
my
own
dear
brother
and
try
to
remember
what
i
said
to
you
this
day
kiss
me
before
you
go
barry
barry
leaned
over
the
bed
and
kissed
her
and
then
crept
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
stairs
with
the
tears
streaming
down
his
red
cheeks
and
skulked
across
the
street
to
his
own
house
with
his
hat
slouched
over
his
face
and
his
handkerchief
held
across
his
mouth
xxv
anty
lynch
scene
the
second
anty
was
a
good
deal
exhausted
by
her
interview
with
her
brother
but
towards
evening
she
rallied
a
little
and
told
jane
who
was
sitting
with
her
that
she
wanted
to
say
one
word
in
private
to
martin
jane
was
rather
surprised
for
though
martin
was
in
the
habit
of
going
into
the
room
every
morning
to
see
the
invalid
anty
had
never
before
asked
for
him
however
she
went
for
martin
and
found
him
martin
said
she
anty
wants
to
see
you
alone
in
private
me
said
martin
turning
a
little
red
do
you
know
what
it
about
she
did
say
a
word
only
she
wanted
to
see
you
alone
but
thinking
it
something
about
her
brother
he
was
with
her
a
long
long
time
this
morning
and
went
away
more
like
a
dead
man
than
a
live
one
but
come
do
keep
her
waiting
and
whatever
you
do
do
stay
long
every
word
she
spakes
is
killing
her
martin
followed
his
sister
into
the
and
gently
taking
anty
offered
hand
asked
her
in
a
whisper
what
he
could
do
for
her
jane
went
out
and
to
do
her
justice
sat
herself
down
at
a
distance
from
the
door
though
she
was
in
a
painful
state
of
curiosity
as
to
what
was
being
said
within
you
all
too
good
to
me
martin
said
anty
you
spoil
me
between
you
minding
every
word
i
say
so
quick
martin
assured
her
again
in
a
whisper
that
anything
and
everything
they
could
do
for
her
was
only
a
pleasure
do
mind
whispering
said
anty
spake
out
your
voice
wo
hurt
me
i
love
to
hear
your
voices
they
all
so
kind
and
good
but
martin
i
business
you
must
do
for
me
and
that
at
once
for
i
feel
within
me
that
i
soon
be
gone
from
this
we
hope
not
anty
but
it
all
with
god
now
is
it
no
one
knows
that
betther
than
yourself
oh
yes
i
do
know
that
and
i
feel
it
is
his
pleasure
that
it
should
be
so
and
i
do
fear
to
die
a
few
weeks
back
the
thoughts
of
death
when
they
came
upon
me
nearly
killed
me
but
that
feeling
all
gone
now
martin
did
not
know
what
answer
to
make
he
again
told
her
he
hoped
she
would
soon
get
better
it
is
a
difficult
task
to
talk
properly
to
a
dying
person
about
death
and
martin
felt
that
he
was
quite
incompetent
to
do
so
but
she
continued
after
a
little
there
still
much
that
i
want
to
do
that
i
ought
to
do
in
the
first
place
i
must
make
my
will
martin
was
again
puzzled
this
was
another
subject
on
which
he
felt
himself
equally
unwilling
to
speak
he
could
not
advise
her
not
to
make
one
and
he
certainly
would
not
advise
her
to
do
so
your
will
anty
there
time
enough
for
that
you
be
sthronger
you
know
in
a
day
or
two
doctor
colligan
says
so
and
then
we
talk
about
it
i
hope
there
is
time
enough
martin
but
there
is
more
than
enough
it
not
much
that
i
have
to
say
were
you
spaking
to
barry
about
it
this
morning
oh
i
was
i
told
him
what
i
do
he
have
the
property
now
mostly
all
as
one
as
av
the
ould
man
had
left
it
to
him
it
would
have
been
betther
so
eh
martin
anty
never
doubted
her
disinterestedness
at
this
moment
she
suspected
him
of
no
dirty
longing
after
her
money
and
she
did
him
only
justice
when
he
came
into
her
room
he
had
no
thoughts
of
inheriting
anything
from
her
had
he
been
sure
that
by
asking
he
could
have
induced
her
to
make
a
will
in
his
favour
he
would
not
have
done
so
but
still
his
heart
sunk
a
little
within
him
when
he
heard
her
declare
that
she
was
going
to
leave
everything
back
to
her
brother
it
was
however
only
for
a
moment
he
remembered
his
honest
determination
firmly
and
resolutely
to
protect
their
joint
property
against
any
of
her
brother
attempts
should
he
ever
marry
her
but
in
no
degree
to
strive
or
even
hanker
after
it
unless
it
became
his
own
in
a
fair
straightforward
manner
well
anty
i
think
you
right
said
he
but
would
it
all
go
to
barry
nathurally
without
your
bothering
yourself
about
a
will
and
you
so
wake
in
course
it
would
at
laist
i
suppose
so
but
martin
and
she
smiled
faintly
as
she
looked
up
into
his
face
i
want
the
two
dear
dear
girls
and
i
want
yourself
to
have
some
little
thing
to
remember
me
by
and
your
dear
kind
mother
she
does
want
money
but
if
i
ask
her
to
take
a
few
of
the
silver
things
in
the
house
i
sure
she
keep
them
for
my
sake
oh
martin
i
do
love
you
all
so
very
so
very
much
and
the
warm
tears
streamed
down
her
cheeks
martin
eyes
were
affected
too
he
made
a
desperate
struggle
to
repress
the
weakness
but
he
could
not
succeed
and
was
obliged
to
own
it
by
rubbing
his
eyes
with
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
and
i
shure
anty
said
he
we
all
love
you
any
one
must
love
you
who
knew
you
and
then
he
paused
he
was
trying
to
say
something
of
his
own
true
personal
regard
for
her
but
he
hardly
knew
how
to
express
it
we
all
love
you
as
though
you
were
one
of
ourselves
and
so
you
are
it
all
the
same
at
any
rate
it
is
to
me
and
i
would
have
been
one
of
you
had
i
lived
i
can
talk
to
you
more
about
it
now
martin
than
i
ever
could
before
because
i
know
i
feel
i
am
dying
but
you
must
talk
anty
it
wakens
you
and
you
had
too
much
talking
already
this
day
it
does
me
good
martin
and
i
must
say
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
i
may
be
able
again
had
it
plazed
god
i
should
have
lived
i
would
have
prayed
for
nothing
higher
or
betther
than
to
be
one
of
such
a
family
as
yourselves
had
i
been
had
i
been
and
now
anty
blushed
again
and
she
also
found
a
difficulty
in
expressing
herself
but
she
soon
got
over
it
and
continued
had
i
been
permitted
to
marry
you
martin
i
think
i
would
have
been
a
good
wife
to
you
i
am
very
very
sure
i
would
have
been
an
affectionate
one
i
shure
you
would
i
shure
you
would
anty
god
send
you
may
still
av
you
war
only
once
well
again
there
nothing
now
to
hindher
us
you
forget
barry
anty
said
with
a
shudder
but
it
does
matther
talking
of
that
now
martin
was
on
the
point
of
telling
her
that
barry
had
agreed
under
certain
conditions
to
their
marriage
but
on
second
thoughts
he
felt
it
would
be
useless
to
do
so
and
anty
continued
i
would
have
done
all
i
could
martin
i
would
have
loved
you
fondly
and
truly
i
would
have
liked
what
you
liked
and
av
i
could
i
would
made
your
home
quiet
and
happy
your
mother
should
have
been
my
mother
and
your
sisthers
my
sisthers
so
they
are
now
anty
so
they
are
now
my
own
own
anty
they
love
you
as
much
as
though
they
were
god
almighty
bless
them
for
their
goodness
and
you
too
martin
i
can
not
tell
you
i
niver
could
tell
you
how
i
valued
your
honest
thrue
love
for
i
know
you
have
loved
me
honestly
and
thruly
but
always
been
afraid
to
spake
to
you
i
sometimes
thought
you
must
despise
me
i
been
so
wake
and
cowardly
despise
you
anty
how
could
i
despise
you
when
i
always
loved
you
but
now
martin
about
poor
barry
for
he
is
poor
i
sometimes
thought
as
i
been
lying
here
the
long
long
hours
awake
that
feeling
to
you
as
i
do
i
ought
to
be
laving
you
what
the
ould
man
left
to
me
i
be
sorry
you
did
anty
i
not
be
saying
but
what
i
thought
of
that
when
i
first
looked
for
you
but
it
was
never
to
take
it
from
you
but
to
share
it
with
you
and
make
you
happy
with
it
i
know
it
martin
i
always
knew
it
and
felt
it
and
now
av
it
god
will
that
you
should
go
from
us
i
rather
barry
had
the
money
than
us
we
enough
the
lord
be
praised
and
i
would
for
worlds
it
should
be
said
that
it
war
for
that
we
brought
you
among
us
nor
for
all
county
galway
would
i
lave
it
to
barry
to
say
that
when
you
were
here
sick
and
wake
and
dying
we
put
a
pen
into
your
hand
to
make
you
sign
a
will
to
rob
him
of
what
should
by
rights
be
his
that
it
dear
martin
it
would
bless
you
if
you
had
it
it
can
bless
no
one
who
looks
to
it
alone
for
a
blessing
it
would
make
you
happy
it
would
make
you
miserable
av
people
said
you
had
that
which
you
ought
not
to
have
besides
i
love
my
poor
brother
he
is
my
brother
my
only
real
relation
we
lived
all
our
lives
together
and
though
he
is
what
he
should
be
the
fault
is
not
all
his
own
i
should
not
sleep
in
my
grave
av
i
died
with
his
curse
upon
me
as
i
should
av
he
found
when
i
am
gone
that
i
willed
the
property
all
away
i
told
him
he
have
it
all
nearly
all
and
i
begged
him
prayed
to
him
from
my
dying
bed
to
mend
his
ways
to
try
and
be
something
betther
in
the
world
than
what
i
fear
he
like
to
be
i
think
he
minded
what
i
said
when
he
was
here
for
words
have
a
solemn
sound
to
the
most
worldly
but
when
i
gone
he
be
all
alone
there
be
no
one
to
look
afther
him
nobody
loves
him
no
one
even
likes
him
no
one
will
live
with
him
but
those
who
mane
to
rob
him
and
he
will
be
robbed
and
plundered
and
desaved
when
he
thinks
he
robbing
and
desaving
others
anty
paused
more
for
breath
than
for
a
reply
but
martin
felt
that
he
must
say
something
indeed
anty
i
fear
he
hardly
come
to
good
he
dhrinks
too
much
by
all
accounts
besides
he
idle
and
the
honest
feeling
is
in
him
it
thrue
dear
martin
it
too
thrue
will
you
do
me
a
great
great
favour
martin
and
she
rose
up
a
little
and
turned
her
moist
clear
eye
full
upon
him
will
you
show
your
thrue
love
to
your
poor
anty
by
a
rale
lasting
kindness
but
one
that
be
giving
you
much
much
throuble
and
pain
afther
i
dead
and
gone
long
long
after
i
in
my
cold
grave
will
you
do
that
for
me
martin
indeed
i
will
anty
said
martin
rather
astonished
but
with
a
look
of
solemn
assurance
anything
that
i
can
do
i
will
you
need
dread
my
not
remembering
but
i
fear
it
is
much
that
i
can
do
for
you
will
you
always
think
and
spake
of
barry
will
you
always
act
to
him
and
by
him
and
for
him
not
as
a
man
whom
you
know
and
dislike
but
as
my
brother
your
own
anty
only
brother
whatever
he
does
will
you
thry
to
make
him
do
betther
whatever
troubles
he
in
will
you
lend
him
your
hand
come
what
come
may
to
him
will
you
be
his
frind
he
has
no
frind
now
when
i
gone
will
you
be
a
frind
to
him
martin
was
much
confounded
he
wo
let
me
be
his
frind
he
said
he
looks
down
on
us
and
despises
us
he
thinks
himself
too
high
to
be
befrinded
by
us
besides
of
all
dunmore
he
hates
us
most
he
wo
when
he
finds
you
have
got
the
property
from
him
but
frindship
does
depend
on
letting
rale
frindship
does
i
want
you
to
be
dhrinking
and
ating
and
going
about
with
him
god
forbid
you
too
good
for
that
but
when
you
find
he
wants
a
frind
come
forward
and
thry
and
make
him
do
something
for
himself
you
but
come
together
you
be
the
executhor
in
the
will
wo
you
martin
and
then
he
meet
you
about
the
property
he
ca
help
it
and
you
must
meet
then
as
frinds
and
keep
that
up
if
he
insults
you
forgive
it
or
my
sake
if
he
fractious
and
annoying
put
up
with
it
for
my
sake
for
my
sake
thry
to
make
him
like
you
and
thry
to
make
others
like
him
martin
felt
that
this
would
be
impossible
but
he
did
say
so
no
one
respects
him
now
but
all
respect
you
i
see
it
in
people
eyes
and
manners
without
hearing
what
they
say
av
you
spake
well
of
him
at
any
rate
kindly
of
him
people
wo
turn
themselves
so
against
him
will
you
do
all
this
for
my
sake
martin
solemnly
promised
that
as
far
as
he
could
he
would
do
so
that
at
any
rate
as
far
as
himself
was
concerned
he
would
never
quarrel
with
him
you
have
very
very
much
to
forgive
continued
anty
but
then
it
so
sweet
to
forgive
and
he
had
no
fond
mother
like
you
he
has
not
been
taught
any
duties
any
virtues
as
you
have
he
has
only
been
taught
that
money
is
the
thing
to
love
and
that
he
should
worship
nothing
but
that
martin
for
my
sake
will
you
look
on
him
as
a
brother
a
wicked
bad
castaway
brother
but
still
as
a
brother
to
be
forgiven
and
if
possible
redeemed
as
i
hope
for
glory
in
heaven
i
will
said
martin
but
i
think
he
go
far
from
this
i
think
he
quit
dunmore
maybe
he
will
perhaps
it
betther
he
should
but
he
lave
his
name
behind
him
do
be
too
hard
on
that
and
do
let
others
and
even
av
he
does
go
it
not
be
long
before
he
want
a
frind
and
i
know
anywhere
he
can
go
that
he
likely
to
find
one
wherever
he
may
go
or
whatever
he
may
do
you
wo
forget
he
was
my
brother
will
you
martin
you
wo
forget
he
was
your
own
anty
only
brother
martin
again
gave
her
his
solemn
word
that
he
would
to
the
best
of
his
ability
act
as
a
friend
and
brother
to
barry
and
now
about
the
will
martin
again
endeavoured
to
dissuade
her
from
thinking
about
a
will
just
at
present
ah
but
my
heart
set
upon
it
she
said
i
should
be
happy
unless
i
did
it
and
i
sure
you
do
want
to
make
me
unhappy
now
you
must
get
me
some
lawyer
here
martin
i
afraid
you
not
lawyer
enough
for
that
yourself
indeed
i
not
anty
it
a
trade
i
know
little
about
well
you
must
get
me
a
lawyer
not
for
i
know
i
sha
be
well
enough
but
i
hope
i
shall
next
day
and
you
may
tell
him
just
what
to
put
in
it
i
no
secrets
from
you
and
she
told
him
exactly
what
she
had
before
told
her
brother
that
not
hurt
him
she
continued
and
i
like
to
think
you
and
the
dear
girls
should
accept
something
from
me
martin
then
agreed
to
go
to
daly
he
was
on
good
terms
with
them
all
now
since
making
the
last
offer
to
them
respecting
the
property
besides
as
martin
said
he
knew
no
other
lawyer
and
as
the
will
was
so
decidedly
in
barry
favour
who
was
so
proper
to
make
it
as
own
lawyer
now
martin
said
anty
we
shall
be
desperately
scolded
for
talking
so
long
but
it
was
on
my
mind
to
say
it
all
and
i
betther
now
it
all
over
good
night
dear
anty
said
martin
i
be
seeing
you
every
day
i
hope
martin
till
it
all
over
god
bless
you
god
bless
you
all
and
you
above
all
you
do
know
martin
at
laist
you
did
know
all
along
how
well
how
thruly
i
loved
you
good
night
and
martin
left
the
room
as
barry
had
done
in
tears
but
he
had
no
feeling
within
him
of
which
he
had
cause
to
be
ashamed
he
was
ashamed
and
tried
to
hide
his
face
for
he
was
not
accustomed
to
be
seen
with
the
tears
running
down
his
cheeks
but
still
he
had
within
him
a
strong
sensation
of
gratified
pride
as
he
reflected
that
he
was
the
object
of
the
warmest
affection
to
so
sweet
a
creature
as
anty
lynch
well
martin
what
was
it
she
wanted
said
his
mother
as
she
met
him
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
i
could
tell
you
now
mother
said
he
but
av
there
was
iver
an
angel
on
it
anty
lynch
and
saying
so
he
pushed
open
the
door
and
escaped
into
the
street
i
wondher
what
she
been
about
now
said
the
widow
speculating
to
herself
well
av
she
does
lave
it
away
from
barry
who
can
say
but
what
she
has
a
right
to
do
as
she
likes
with
her
own
and
who
done
the
most
for
her
i
like
to
know
and
pleasant
prospects
of
her
son
enjoying
an
independence
flitted
before
her
mind
eye
but
thin
she
continued
talking
to
herself
i
would
have
it
said
in
dunmore
that
a
kelly
demaned
hisself
to
rob
a
lynch
not
for

all

answered
in
the
same

from
the

upstairs

ambassador
two
days
after
the
hunt
in
which
poor
goneaway
was
killed
by
horse
ballindine
received
the
following
letter
from
his
friend
dot
blake
limmer
hotel
march
dear
frank
i
and
brien
and
bottom
crossed
over
last
friday
night
and
thanks
to
the
god
of
storms
were
allowed
to
get
quietly
through
it
the
young
chieftain
did
like
being
boxed
on
the
quay
a
bit
too
well
the
rattling
of
the
chains
upset
him
and
the
fellows
there
are
so
infernally
noisy
and
awkward
that
i
wonder
he
was
ever
got
on
board
it
difficult
to
make
an
irishman
handy
but
it
the
very
devil
to
make
him
quiet
there
were
four
at
his
head
and
three
at
his
tail
two
at
the
wheel
turning
and
one
up
aloft
hallooing
like
a
demon
in
the
air
and
when
master
brien
showed
a
little
aversion
to
this
comic
performance
they
were
going
to
drag
him
into
the
box
gré
mal
till
bottom
interposed
and
saved
the
men
and
the
horse
from
destroying
each
other
we
got
safe
to
middleham
on
saturday
night
the
greatest
part
of
the
way
by
rail
scott
has
a
splendid
string
of
horses
these
english
fellows
do
their
work
in
tiptop
style
only
they
think
more
of
spending
money
than
they
do
of
making
it
i
waited
to
see
him
out
on
monday
when
he
got
a
trot
and
he
was
as
bright
as
though
never
left
the
curragh
scott
says
he
a
little
too
fine
but
you
know
of
course
he
must
find
some
fault
to
give
igoe
his
due
he
could
not
be
in
better
condition
and
scott
was
obliged
to
own
that
where
he
came
he
was
very
well
i
came
on
here
on
tuesday
and
have
taken
thirteen
wherever
i
could
get
it
and
thought
the
money
safe
i
have
got
a
good
deal
on
and
wo
budge
till
i
do
it
at
six
to
one
and
i
sure
i
bring
him
to
that
i
think
he
rise
quickly
as
he
wants
so
little
training
and
as
his
qualities
must
be
at
once
known
now
he
in
scott
stables
so
if
you
mean
to
put
any
more
on
you
had
better
do
it
at
once
so
much
for
the
stables
i
left
the
other
two
at
home
but
have
one
of
my
own
string
here
as
maybe
i
pick
up
a
match
and
now
i
wish
to
let
you
know
a
report
that
i
heard
this
morning
at
least
a
secret
which
bids
fair
to
become
a
report
it
is
said
that
kilcullen
is
to
marry
f
w
and
that
he
has
already
paid
heaven
only
knows
how
many
thousand
pounds
of
debt
with
her
money
that
the
old
earl
has
arranged
it
all
and
that
the
beautiful
heiress
has
reluctantly
agreed
to
be
made
a
viscountess
i
very
far
from
saying
that
i
believe
this
but
it
may
suit
you
to
know
that
i
heard
the
arrangement
mentioned
before
two
other
persons
one
of
whom
was
morris
strange
enough
this
as
he
was
one
of
the
set
at
handicap
lodge
when
you
told
them
that
the
match
with
yourself
was
still
on
i
have
no
doubt
the
plan
would
suit
father
and
son
you
best
know
how
far
the
lady
may
have
been
likely
to
accede
at
any
rate
my
dear
frank
if
you
take
my
advice
you
not
sit
quiet
till
she
does
marry
some
one
you
ca
expect
she
wear
the
willow
for
you
very
long
if
you
do
nothing
yourself
write
to
her
by
post
and
write
to
the
earl
by
the
same
post
saying
you
have
done
so
tell
her
in
the
sweetest
way
you
can
that
you
can
not
live
without
seeing
her
and
getting
your
if
it
is
to
be
from
her
own
dear
lips
and
tell
him
in
as
few
words
as
you
please
that
you
mean
to
do
yourself
the
honour
of
knocking
at
his
door
on
such
and
such
a
day
and
do
it

he

blake
shall
i
do
anything
for
you
here
about
brien
i
think
i
might
still
get
you
eleven
to
one
but
let
me
hear
at
once
as
frank
read
the
first
portion
of
this
epistle
his
affection
for
his
poor
dear
favourite
nag
returned
in
full
force
and
he
felt
all
the
pangs
of
remorse
for
having
parted
with
him
but
when
he
came
to
the
latter
part
to
lord
kilcullen
name
and
the
initials
by
which
his
own
fanny
was
designated
he
forgot
all
about
horse
and
owner
became
totally
regardless
of
thirteen
eleven
and
six
to
one
and
read
on
hastily
to
the
end
read
it
all
again
then
closed
the
letter
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
remained
for
a
considerable
time
in
silent
contemplation
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
what
he
would
do
nobody
was
with
him
as
he
opened
his
which
he
took
from
the
messenger
as
the
boy
was
coming
up
to
the
house
he
therefore
read
his
letter
alone
on
the
lawn
and
he
continued
pacing
up
and
down
before
the
house
with
a
most
perturbed
air
for
half
an
hour
kilcullen
going
to
marry
fanny
wyndham
so
that
was
the
cause
of
lord
cashel
singular
behaviour
his
incivility
and
refusal
to
allow
frank
to
see
his
ward
what
to
have
arranged
it
all
in
hours
thought
frank
to
himself
to
have
made
over
his
ward
money
to
his
son
before
her
brother
from
whom
she
inherited
it
was
in
his
grave
to
determine
at
once
to
reject
an
accepted
suitor
for
the
sake
of
closing
on
the
poor
girl
money
and
without
the
slightest
regard
for
her
happiness
without
a
thought
for
her
welfare
and
then
such
lies
said
the
viscount
aloud
striking
his
heel
into
the
grass
in
his
angry
impetuosity
such
base
cruel
lies
to
say
that
she
had
authorised
him
when
he
could
have
dared
to
make
such
a
proposal
to
her
and
her
brother
but
two
days
dead
well
i
took
him
for
a
pompous
fool
but
i
never
thought
him
such
an
avaricious
knave
and
fanny
too
could
fanny
have
agreed
so
soon
to
give
her
hand
to
another
she
could
not
have
transferred
her
heart
his
own
dear
fond
fanny
a
short
time
ago
they
had
been
all
in
all
to
each
other
and
now
so
completely
estranged
as
they
were
however
dot
was
right
up
to
this
time
fanny
might
be
quite
true
to
him
indeed
there
was
not
ground
even
for
doubting
her
for
it
was
evident
that
no
reliance
was
to
be
placed
in
lord
cashel
asseverations
but
still
he
could
not
expect
that
she
should
continue
to
consider
herself
engaged
if
she
remained
totally
neglected
by
her
lover
he
must
do
something
and
that
at
once
but
there
was
very
great
difficulty
in
deciding
what
that
something
was
to
be
it
was
easy
enough
for
dot
to
say
first
write
and
then
go
if
he
were
to
write
what
security
was
there
that
his
letter
would
be
allowed
to
reach
fanny
and
if
he
went
how
much
less
chance
was
there
that
he
would
be
allowed
to
see
her
and
then
again
to
be
turned
out
of
the
house
again
informed
by
that
pompous
scheming
earl
that
his
visits
there
were
not
desired
or
worse
still
not
to
be
admitted
to
be
driven
from
the
door
by
a
footman
who
would
well
know
for
what
he
came
no
come
what
come
might
he
would
never
again
go
to
grey
abbey
at
least
not
unless
he
was
specially
and
courteously
invited
thither
by
the
owner
and
then
it
should
only
be
to
marry
his
ward
and
take
her
from
the
odious
place
never
to
return
again
the
impudent
impostor
continued
frank
to
himself
to
pretend
to
suspect
me
when
he
was
himself
hatching
his
dirty
mercenary
heartless
schemes
but
still
the
same
question
recurred
what
was
to
be
done
venting
his
wrath
on
lord
cashel
would
not
get
him
out
of
the
difficulty
going
was
out
of
the
question
writing
was
of
little
use
could
he
not
send
somebody
else
some
one
who
could
not
be
refused
admittance
to
fanny
and
who
might
at
any
rate
learn
what
her
wishes
and
feelings
were
he
did
not
like
making
love
by
deputy
but
still
in
his
present
dilemma
he
could
think
of
nothing
better
but
whom
was
he
to
send
bingham
blake
was
a
man
of
character
and
would
not
make
a
fool
of
himself
but
he
was
too
young
he
would
not
be
able
to
make
his
way
to
fanny
no
a
young
unmarried
man
would
not
mat
tierney
he
was
afraid
of
no
one
and
always
cool
and
collected
but
then
mat
was
in
london
besides
he
was
a
sort
of
friend
of
kilcullen
general
bourke
no
one
could
refuse
an
to
his
venerable
grey
hairs
and
polished
manner
besides
his
standing
in
the
world
was
so
good
so
unexceptionable
but
then
the
chances
were
he
would
not
go
on
such
an
errand
he
was
too
old
to
be
asked
to
take
such
a
troublesome
service
and
besides
if
asked
it
was
very
probable
he
would
say
that
he
considered
lord
cashel
entitled
to
his
ward
obedience
the
rector
the
rev
joseph
armstrong
he
must
be
the
man
there
was
at
any
rate
respectability
in
his
profession
and
he
had
sufficient
worldly
tact
not
easily
to
be
thrust
aside
from
his
object
the
difficulty
would
be
whether
he
had
a
coat
sufficiently
decent
to
appear
in
at
grey
abbey
after
mature
consideration
he
made
up
his
mind
that
the
parson
should
be
his
ambassador
he
would
sooner
have
confided
in
bingham
blake
but
an
unmarried
man
would
not
do
no
the
parson
must
be
the
man
frank
was
unfortunately
but
little
disposed
to
act
in
any
case
without
advice
and
in
his
anxiety
to
consult
some
one
as
to
consulting
the
parson
returned
into
the
house
to
make
a
clear
breast
of
it
to
his
mother
he
found
her
in
the
with
the
two
girls
and
the
three
were
holding
council
deep
oh
here
frank
said
sophy
we
better
tell
him
all
about
it
at
once
and
he
tell
us
which
she
like
best
we
did
mean
to
tell
you
said
guss
but
i
and
sophy
are
going
to
work
two
sofas
for
the
in
berlin
wool
you
know
be
very
handsome
everybody
has
them
now
you
know
they
have
a
splendid
pair
at
ballyhaunis
which
nora
and
her
cousin
worked
but
we
want
to
know
what
pattern
would
suit
fanny
taste
said
sophy
well
you
ca
know
that
said
frank
rather
pettishly
so
better
please
yourselves
oh
but
you
must
know
what
she
likes
continued
guss
i
for
this
and
she
displayed
a
pattern
showing
forth
two
gorgeous
macaws
each
with
plumage
of
the
brightest
colours
the
colours
are
so
bright
and
the
feathers
will
work
in
so
well
i
do
like
anything
in
but
flowers
said
sophy
nora
dillon
says
she
saw
two
most
beautiful
wreaths
at
that
shop
in
grafton
street
both
hanging
from
bars
you
know
and
that
would
be
so
much
prettier
i
sure
fanny
would
like
flowers
best
would
she
now
frank
mamma
thinks
the
common
patterns
are
nicer
for
furniture
indeed
i
do
my
dear
said
mrs
and
you
see
them
much
more
common
now
in
but
still
i
much
sooner
have
them
just
what
fanny
would
like
best
surely
frank
you
must
have
heard
her
speak
about
all
this
completely
disconcerted
frank
and
made
him
very
much
out
of
love
with
his
own
plan
of
consulting
his
mother
he
gave
the
trio
some
not
very
encouraging
answer
as
to
their
intentions
towards
his
and
again
left
them
alone
well
there
nothing
for
it
but
to
send
the
parson
i
do
think
he
make
a
fool
of
himself
but
then
i
know
he
look
so
shabby
however
here
goes
and
he
mounted
his
nag
and
rode
off
to
ballindine
glebe
the
was
about
a
couple
of
miles
from
kelly
court
and
it
was
about
four
when
lord
ballindine
got
there
he
knocked
at
the
door
which
was
wide
open
though
it
was
yet
only
the
last
day
of
march
and
was
told
by
a
remarkably
slatternly
that
her
master
was
jist
afther
dinner
that
he
was
stepped
out
but
was
about
the
place
and
could
be
fetched
in
at
oncet
and
would
his
honour
walk
in
and
so
lord
ballindine
was
shown
into
the
rectory
on
one
side
of
the
passage
alias
hall
while
the
attendant
of
all
work
went
to
announce
his
arrival
in
the
rectory
on
the
other
side
here
mrs
armstrong
was
sitting
among
her
numerous
progeny
securing
the
of
the
dinner
from
their
rapacious
paws
and
endeavouring
to
make
two
very
unruly
boys
consume
the
portions
of
fat
which
had
been
supplied
to
them
with
as
they
loudly
declared
an
unfairly
insufficient
quantum
of
lean
as
the
girl
was
enough
to
leave
both
doors
wide
open
frank
had
the
full
advantage
of
the
conversation
now
greg
said
the
mother

you

and
you
shall
both

before
you
have
a
bit
of
anything
else
then
followed
a
desperate
fit
of
coughing
my
poor
minny
said
the
mother

just
as
bad
as
ever
why
would
you

wet
grass

said
greg
jumping
up
to
rush
into
the
other
room
he
come
about
the
black
colt
i
know
stay
where
you
are
greg
and
do
go
in
there
with
your
dirty
face
and
fingers
and
after
speculating
a
little
longer
the
lady
went
into
the
herself
though
to
tell
the
truth
her
own
face
and
fingers
were
hardly
in
a
state
suitable
for
receiving
company
mrs
armstrong
marched
into
the
with
something
of
a
stately
air
to
meet
the
strange
gentleman
and
there
she
found
her
old
friend
lord
ballindine
whoever
called
at
the
rectory
and
at
whatever
hour
the
visit
might
be
made
poor
mrs
armstrong
was
sure
to
apologise
for
the
confusion
in
which
she
was
found
she
had
always
just
got
rid
of
a
servant
and
could
not
get
another
that
suited
her
or
there
was
some
other
commonplace
reason
for
her
being
discovered
however
she
managed
to
talk
to
frank
for
a
minute
or
two
with
tolerable
volubility
till
her
eyes
happening
to
dwell
on
her
own
hands
which
were
certainly
not
as
white
as
a
lady
should
be
she
became
a
little
uncomfortable
and
embarrassed
tried
to
hide
them
in
her
drapery
then
remembered
that
she
had
on
her
morning
slippers
which
were
rather
the
worse
for
wear
and
feeling
too
much
ashamed
of
her
to
remain
hurried
out
of
the
room
saying
that
she
would
go
and
see
where
armstrong
could
possibly
have
got
himself
to
she
did
not
appear
again
to
lord
ballindine
footnote
en
déshabille
french
partly
or
scantily
dressed
poor
mrs
armstrong
though
she
looked
so
little
like
one
she
had
been
brought
up
as
a
lady
carefully
and
delicately
and
her
lot
was
the
more
miserable
for
she
knew
how
lamentable
were
her
present
deficiencies
when
she
married
a
poor
curate
having
herself
only
a
few
hundred
pounds
fortune
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
a
life
of
comparative
poverty
but
she
had
meant
even
in
her
poverty
to
be
decent
respectable
and
weak
health
nine
children
an
improvident
husband
and
an
income
so
lamentably
to
her
wants
had
however
been
too
much
for
her
and
she
had
degenerated
into
a
slatternly
idle
scold
in
a
short
time
the
parson
came
in
from
his
farm
rusty
and
muddy
rusty
from
his
clerical
dress
muddy
from
his
farming
occupations
and
lord
ballindine
went
into
the
business
of
his
embassy
he
remembered
however
how
plainly
he
had
heard
the
threats
about
the
uneaten
fat
and
not
wishing
the
household
to
hear
all
he
had
to
say
respecting
fanny
wyndham
he
took
the
parson
out
into
the
road
before
the
house
and
walking
up
and
down
unfolded
his
proposal
mr
armstrong
expressed
extreme
surprise
at
the
nature
of
the
mission
on
which
he
was
to
be
sent
secondly
at
the
necessity
of
such
a
mission
at
all
and
thirdly
lastly
and
chiefly
at
the
enormous
amount
of
the
heiress
fortune
to
lose
which
he
declared
would
be
an
unpardonable
sin
on
lord
ballindine
part
he
seemed
to
be
not
at
all
surprised
that
lord
cashel
should
wish
to
secure
so
much
money
in
his
own
family
nor
did
he
at
all
participate
in
the
unmeasured
reprobation
with
which
frank
loaded
the
worthy
earl
name
one
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
pounds
would
justify
anything
and
he
thought
of
his
nine
poor
children
his
poor
wife
his
poor
home
his
poor
two
hundred
and
his
poor
self
he
calculated
that
so
very
rich
a
lady
would
most
probably
have
some
interest
in
the
church
which
she
could
not
but
exercise
in
his
favour
if
he
were
instrumental
in
getting
her
married
and
he
determined
to
go
then
the
difficult
question
as
to
the
wardrobe
occurred
to
him
besides
he
had
no
money
for
the
road
those
however
were
minor
evils
to
be
got
over
and
he
expressed
himself
willing
to
undertake
the
embassy
but
my
dear
ballindine
what
is
it
i
to
do
said
he
of
course
you
know
i
do
anything
for
you
as
of
course
i
ought
anything
that
ought
to
be
done
but
what
is
it
exactly
you
wish
me
to
say
you
see
armstrong
that
pettifogging
schemer
told
me
he
did
wish
me
to
come
to
his
house
again
and
i
would
even
for
fanny
wyndham
force
myself
into
any
man
house
he
would
not
let
me
see
her
when
i
was
there
and
i
could
not
press
it
because
her
brother
was
only
just
dead
so
i
obliged
to
take
her
refusal
second
hand
now
i
believe
she
ever
sent
the
message
he
gave
me
i
think
he
has
made
her
believe
that
i
deserting
and
her
and
in
this
way
she
may
be
piqued
and
tormented
into
marrying
kilcullen
i
see
it
now
upon
my
word
then
lord
cashel
knows
how
to
play
his
cards
but
if
i
go
to
grey
abbey
i
ca
see
her
without
seeing
him
of
course
not
but
i
coming
to
that
you
see
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
fanny
love
she
has
assured
me
of
it
a
thousand
times
i
would
say
so
to
you
even
as
it
looks
like
boasting
only
it
so
necessary
you
should
know
how
the
land
lies
besides
everybody
knew
it
all
the
world
knew
we
were
engaged
oh
boasting
it
no
boasting
at
all
it
would
be
very
little
good
my
going
to
grey
abbey
if
she
had
not
told
you
so
well
i
think
that
if
you
were
to
see
lord
cashel
and
tell
him
in
your
own
quiet
way
who
you
are
that
you
are
rector
of
ballindine
and
my
especial
friend
and
that
you
had
come
all
the
way
from
county
mayo
especially
to
see
miss
wyndham
that
you
might
hear
from
herself
whatever
message
she
had
to
send
to
me
if
you
were
to
do
this
i
think
he
would
dare
to
prevent
you
from
seeing
her
if
he
did
of
course
i
would
put
it
to
him
that
you
who
were
so
long
received
as
miss
wyndham
accepted
swain
were
at
least
entitled
to
so
much
consideration
at
her
hands
and
that
i
must
demand
so
much
on
your
behalf
would
that
be
it
eh
exactly
i
see
you
understand
it
as
if
you
been
at
it
all
your
life
only
do
call
me
her
swain
well
i
think
of
another
word
her
beau
for
heaven
sake
no
that
ten
times
worse
well
her
lover
that
at
any
rate
english
but
say
her
accepted
husband
that
be
true
and
plain
if
you
do
that
i
think
you
will
manage
to
see
her
and
then
well
then
for
that
be
the
difficult
part
oh
when
you
see
her
one
simple
word
will
do
fanny
wyndham
loves
plain
dealing
merely
tell
her
that
lord
ballindine
has
not
changed
his
mind
and
that
he
wishes
to
know
from
herself
by
the
mouth
of
a
friend
whom
he
can
trust
whether
she
has
changed
hers
if
she
tells
you
that
she
has
i
would
not
follow
her
farther
though
she
were
twice
as
rich
as
croesus
i
not
hunting
her
for
her
money
but
i
am
determined
that
lord
cashel
shall
not
make
us
both
miserable
by
forcing
her
into
a
marriage
with
his
of
a
son
well
ballindine
i
go
but
mind
you
must
not
blame
me
if
i
fail
i
do
the
best
i
can
for
you
of
course
i
wo
when
will
you
be
able
to
start
why
i
suppose
there
no
immediate
hurry
said
the
parson
remembering
that
the
new
suit
of
clothes
must
be
procured
oh
but
there
is
kilcullen
will
be
there
at
once
and
considering
how
long
it
is
since
i
saw
fanny
three
months
i
believe
no
time
should
be
lost
how
long
is
her
brother
dead
oh
a
month
or
very
near
it
well
i
go
monday
fortnight
that
do
wo
it
it
was
at
last
agreed
that
the
parson
was
to
start
for
grey
abbey
on
the
monday
week
following
that
he
was
to
mention
to
no
one
where
he
was
going
that
he
was
to
tell
his
wife
that
he
was
going
on
business
he
was
not
allowed
to
talk
about
she
would
be
a
very
meek
woman
if
she
rested
satisfied
with
that
and
that
he
was
to
present
himself
at
grey
abbey
on
the
following
wednesday
and
now
said
the
parson
with
some
little
hesitation
my
difficulty
commences
we
country
rectors
are
never
rich
but
when
we
nine
children
ballindine
it
rare
to
find
us
with
money
in
our
pockets
you
must
advance
me
a
little
cash
for
the
emergencies
of
the
road
my
dear
fellow
of
course
the
expense
must
be
my
own
i
send
you
down
a
note
between
this
and
then
i
have
enough
about
me
now
or
stay
i
give
you
a
cheque
and
he
turned
into
the
house
and
wrote
him
a
cheque
for
twenty
pounds
that
get
the
coat
into
the
bargain
thought
the
rector
as
he
rather
uncomfortably
shuffled
the
bit
of
paper
into
his
pocket
he
had
still
a
gentleman
dislike
to
be
paid
for
his
services
but
then
necessity
how
stern
she
is
he
literally
could
not
have
gone
without
it
xxvii
mr
lynch
last
resource
on
the
following
morning
lord
ballindine
as
he
had
appointed
to
do
drove
over
to
dunmore
to
settle
with
martin
about
the
money
and
if
necessary
to
go
with
him
to
the
attorney
office
in
tuam
martin
had
as
yet
given
daly
no
answer
respecting
barry
lynch
last
proposal
and
though
poor
anty
health
made
it
hardly
necessary
that
any
answer
should
be
given
still
lord
ballindine
had
promised
to
see
the
attorney
if
martin
thought
it
necessary
the
family
were
all
in
great
confusion
that
morning
for
anty
was
very
bad
worse
than
she
had
ever
been
she
was
in
a
paroxysm
of
fever
was
raving
in
delirium
and
in
such
a
state
that
martin
and
his
sister
were
occasionally
obliged
to
hold
her
in
bed
sally
the
old
servant
had
been
in
the
room
for
a
considerable
time
during
the
morning
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
with
a
big
in
her
hand
and
begging
in
a
whining
voice
from
time
to
time
that
miss
anty
god
bless
her
might
get
a
dhrink
of
tay
but
as
she
had
been
of
no
other
service
and
as
the
widow
thought
it
as
well
that
she
should
not
hear
what
anty
said
in
her
raving
she
had
been
desired
to
go
and
was
sitting
over
the
fire
she
had
fixed
the
big
among
the
embers
and
held
a
of
tea
in
her
lap
discoursing
to
nelly
who
with
her
hair
somewhat
more
than
ordinarily
dishevelled
in
token
of
grief
for
illness
was
seated
on
a
low
stool
nursing
a
well
nelly
said
the
prophetic
sally
boding
evil
in
her
anger
for
considering
how
long
she
had
been
in
the
family
she
had
thought
herself
entitled
to
hear

into
the
sod
without
a
word
said
to
him
about
it
god

betwixt
us
and
all

and
she
took
a
long
pull
at
the
and
as
the
liquid
flowed
down
her
throat
she
gradually
threw
back
her
head
till
the
top
of
her
mop
cap
was
flattened
against
the
side
of
the
wide
and
the
bowl
was
turned
bottom
upwards
so
that
the
brown
sugar
might
trickle
into
her
mouth
she
then
gave
a
long
sigh
and
repeated
that
difficult
question
who
is
they
to
ax
to
the
wake
it
was
too
much
for
nelly
to
answer
she
the
sigh
and
more
closely
embraced
the
candlestick

docthor
back
again
only
mostly
he
do

knocking
much
nelly
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
to
lord
ballindine
who
had
left
his
gig
in
charge
of
his
servant
he
asked
for
martin
who
in
a
short
time
joined
him
in
the
parlour
this
is
a
dangerous
place
for
your
lordship
now
said
he
the
fever
is
so
bad
in
the
house
thank
god
nobody
seems
to
have
taken
it
yet
but
there
no
knowing
is
she
still
so
bad
martin
worse
than
iver
a
dale
worse
i
do
think
it
last
long
now
another
bout
such
as
this
last
about
finish
it
but
i
wo
keep
your
lordship
i
managed
about
the
money
and
the
necessary
writing
was
gone
through
and
the
cash
was
handed
to
lord
ballindine
you
given
over
all
thoughts
then
about
lynch
offer
eh
martin
i
suppose
you
done
with
all
that
now
quite
done
with
it
my
lord
and
done
with
too
seen
enough
this
last
time
back
to
cure
me
altogether
at
laist
i
hope
so
she
does
mean
to
make
any
will
then
why
she
wishes
to
make
one
but
i
doubt
whether
she
ever
be
able
and
then
martin
gave
his
landlord
an
account
of
all
that
anty
had
said
about
her
will
her
wishes
as
to
the
property
her
desire
to
leave
something
to
him
martin
and
his
sisters
and
last
he
repeated
the
strong
injunctions
which
anty
had
given
him
respecting
her
poor
brother
and
her
assurance
so
full
of
affection
that
had
she
lived
she
would
have
done
her
best
to
make
him
happy
as
her
husband
lord
ballindine
was
greatly
affected
he
warmly
shook
hands
with
martin
told
him
how
highly
he
thought
of
his
conduct
and
begged
him
to
take
care
that
anty
had
the
gratification
of
making
her
will
as
she
had
desired
to
do
the
fact
lord
ballindine
said
of
your
being
named
in
the
will
as
her
executor
will
give
you
more
control
over
barry
than
anything
else
could
do
he
then
proposed
at
once
to
go
himself
to
tuam
and
explain
to
daly
what
it
was
miss
lynch
wished
him
to
do
this
lord
ballindine
did
and
the
next
day
the
will
was
completed
for
a
week
or
ten
days
anty
remained
in
much
the
same
condition
after
each
attack
of
fever
it
was
expected
that
she
would
perish
from
weakness
and
exhaustion
but
she
still
held
on
and
then
the
fever
abated
and
doctor
colligan
thought
that
it
was
possible
she
might
recover
she
was
however
so
dreadfully
emaciated
and
worn
out
there
was
so
little
vitality
left
in
her
that
he
would
not
encourage
more
than
the
faintest
hope
anty
herself
was
too
weak
either
to
hope
or
fear
and
the
women
of
the
family
who
from
continual
attendance
knew
how
very
near
to
death
she
was
would
hardly
allow
themselves
to
think
that
she
could
recover
there
were
two
persons
however
who
from
the
moment
of
her
amendment
felt
an
inward
sure
conviction
of
her
convalescence
they
were
martin
and
barry
to
the
former
this
feeling
was
of
course
one
of
unalloyed
delight
he
went
over
to
kelly
court
and
spoke
there
of
his
betrothed
as
though
she
were
already
sitting
up
and
eating
mutton
chops
was
congratulated
by
the
young
ladies
on
his
approaching
nuptials
and
sauntered
round
the
kelly
court
shrubberies
with
frank
talking
over
his
future
prospects
asking
advice
about
this
and
that
and
propounding
the
pros
and
cons
on
that
difficult
question
whether
he
would
live
at
dunmore
or
build
a
house
at
toneroe
for
himself
and
anty
with
barry
however
the
feeling
was
very
different
he
was
again
going
to
have
his
property
wrenched
from
him
he
was
again
to
suffer
the
pangs
he
had
endured
when
first
he
learned
the
purport
of
his
father
will
after
clutching
the
fruit
for
which
he
had
striven
as
even
he
himself
felt
so
basely
it
was
again
to
be
torn
from
him
so
cruelly
he
had
been
horribly
anxious
for
a
termination
to
anty
sufferings
horribly
impatient
to
feel
himself
possessor
of
the
whole
from
day
to
day
and
sometimes
two
or
three
times
a
day
he
had
seen
dr
colligan
and
inquired
how
things
were
going
on
he
had
especially
enjoined
that
worthy
man
to
come
up
after
his
morning
call
at
the
inn
and
get
a
glass
of
sherry
at
dunmore
house
and
the
doctor
had
very
generally
done
so
for
some
time
barry
endeavoured
to
throw
the
veil
of
brotherly
regard
over
the
true
source
of
his
anxiety
but
the
veil
was
much
too
thin
to
hide
what
it
hardly
covered
and
barry
as
he
got
intimate
with
the
doctor
all
but
withdrew
it
altogether
when
barry
would
say
well
doctor
how
is
she
and
then
remark
in
answer
to
the
doctor
statement
that
she
was
very
bad
well
i
suppose
it
last
much
longer
but
it
very
tedious
is
it
poor
thing
it
was
plain
enough
that
the
brother
was
not
longing
for
the
recovery
and
then
he
would
go
a
little
further
and
remark
that
if
the
poor
thing
was
to
go
it
would
be
better
for
all
she
went
at
once
and
expressed
an
opinion
that
he
was
rather
by
being
kept
so
very
long
in
suspense
doctor
colligan
ought
to
have
been
shocked
at
this
and
so
he
was
at
first
to
a
certain
extent
but
he
was
not
a
man
of
a
very
high
tone
of
feeling
he
had
so
often
heard
of
heirs
to
estates
longing
for
the
death
of
the
proprietors
of
them
he
had
so
often
seen
relatives
callous
and
indifferent
at
the
loss
of
those
who
ought
to
have
been
dear
to
them
it
seemed
so
natural
to
him
that
barry
should
want
the
estate
that
he
gradually
got
accustomed
to
his
impatient
inquiries
and
listened
to
and
answered
them
without
disgust
he
fell
too
into
a
kind
of
intimacy
with
barry
he
liked
his
daily
glass
or
three
or
four
glasses
of
sherry
and
besides
it
was
a
good
thing
for
him
to
stand
well
in
a
professional
point
of
view
with
a
man
who
had
the
best
house
in
the
village
and
who
would
soon
have
eight
hundred
if
barry
showed
his
impatience
and
discontent
as
long
as
the
daily
bulletins
told
him
that
anty
was
still
alive
though
dying
it
may
easily
be
imagined
that
he
did
not
hide
his
displeasure
when
he
first
heard
that
she
was
alive
and
better
his
brow
grew
very
black
his
cheeks
flushed
the
drops
of
sweat
stood
on
his
forehead
and
he
said
speaking
through
his
closed
teeth
d
it
doctor
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
she
recovering
now
i
do
say
mr
lynch
whether
she
is
or
no
but
it
certain
the
fever
has
left
her
she
very
weak
very
weak
indeed
i
never
knew
a
person
to
be
alive
and
have
less
life
in
but
the
fever
has
left
her
and
there
certainly
is
hope
hope
said
barry
why
you
told
me
she
could
live
i
do
say
she
will
mr
lynch
but
i
say
she
may
of
course
we
must
do
what
we
can
for
her
and
the
doctor
took
his
sherry
and
went
his
way
how
horrible
then
was
the
state
of
barry
mind
for
a
time
he
was
absolutely
stupified
with
despair
he
stood
fixed
on
the
spot
where
the
doctor
had
left
him
realising
bringing
home
to
himself
the
tidings
which
he
had
heard
his
sister
to
rise
again
as
though
it
were
from
the
dead
to
push
him
off
his
stool
was
he
to
fall
again
into
that
horrid
low
abyss
in
which
even
the
tuam
attorney
had
scorned
him
in
which
he
had
even
invited
that
odious
huxter
son
to
marry
his
sister
and
live
in
his
house
what
was
he
again
to
be
reduced
to
poverty
to
want
to
despair
by
her
whom
he
so
hated
could
nothing
be
done
something
must
be
done
she
should
not
be
could
not
be
allowed
to
leave
that
bed
of
sickness
alive
there
must
be
an
end
of
her
he
muttered
through
his
teeth
or
she
drive
me
mad
and
then
he
thought
how
easily
he
might
have
smothered
her
as
she
lay
there
clasping
his
hand
with
no
one
but
themselves
in
the
room
and
as
the
thought
crossed
his
brain
his
eyes
nearly
started
from
his
head
the
sweat
ran
down
his
face
he
clutched
the
money
in
his
trousers
pocket
till
the
coin
left
an
impression
on
his
flesh
and
he
gnashed
his
teeth
till
his
jaws
ached
with
his
own
violence
but
then
in
that
he
had
been
afraid
of
her
he
could
not
have
touched
her
then
for
the
wealth
of
the
bank
of
england
but
now
the
devil
sat
within
him
and
revelled
with
full
dominion
over
his
soul
there
was
then
no
feeling
left
akin
to
humanity
to
give
him
one
chance
of
escape
there
was
no
glimmer
of
pity
no
shadow
of
remorse
no
sparkle
of
love
even
though
of
a
degraded
kind
no
hesitation
in
the
will
for
crime
which
might
yet
by
god
grace
lead
to
its
eschewal
all
there
was
black
foul
and
deadly
ready
for
the
devil
deadliest
work
murder
crouched
there
ready
to
spring
yet
afraid
cowardly
but
too
thirsty
alter
blood
to
heed
its
own
fears
theft
low
pilfering
pettifogging
theft
avarice
lust
and
impotent
scalding
hatred
controlled
by
these
the
black
blood
rushed
quick
to
and
from
his
heart
filling
him
with
sensual
desires
below
the
passions
of
a
brute
but
denying
him
one
feeling
or
one
appetite
for
aught
that
was
good
or
even
human
again
the
next
morning
the
doctor
was
questioned
with
intense
anxiety
was
she
going
was
she
drooping
had
yesterday
horrid
doubts
raised
only
a
false
alarm
it
was
utterly
beyond
barry
power
to
make
any
attempt
at
concealment
even
of
the
most
shallow
kind
well
doctor
is
she
dying
yet
was
the
brutal
question
he
put
she
is
if
anything
rather
stronger
answered
the
doctor
shuddering
involuntarily
at
the
open
expression
of
barry
atrocious
wish
and
yet
taking
his
glass
of
wine
the
devil
she
is
muttered
barry
throwing
himself
into
an
he
sat
there
some
little
time
and
the
doctor
also
sat
down
said
nothing
but
continued
sipping
his
wine
in
the
name
of
mercy
what
must
i
do
said
barry
speaking
more
to
himself
than
to
the
other
why
you
enough
mr
lynch
without
hers
you
can
do
well
enough
without
it
enough
would
you
think
you
had
enough
if
you
were
robbed
of
more
than
half
of
all
you
have
half
indeed
he
shouted
i
may
say
all
at
once
i
do
believe
there
a
man
in
ireland
would
bear
it
nor
will
i
again
there
was
a
silence
but
still
somehow
colligan
seemed
to
stay
longer
than
usual
every
now
and
then
barry
would
for
a
moment
look
full
in
his
face
and
almost
instantly
drop
his
eyes
again
he
was
trying
to
mature
future
plans
bringing
into
shape
thoughts
which
had
occurred
to
him
in
a
wild
way
at
different
times
proposing
to
himself
schemes
with
which
his
brain
had
been
long
loaded
but
which
he
had
never
resolved
on
which
he
had
never
made
palpable
and
definite
one
thing
he
found
sure
and
certain
on
one
point
he
was
able
to
become
determined
he
could
not
do
it
alone
he
must
have
an
assistant
he
must
buy
some
one
aid
and
again
he
looked
at
colligan
and
again
his
eyes
fell
there
was
no
encouragement
there
but
there
was
no
discouragement
why
did
he
stay
there
so
long
why
did
he
so
slowly
sip
that
third
glass
of
wine
was
he
waiting
to
be
asked
was
he
ready
willing
to
be
bought
there
must
be
something
in
his
thoughts
he
must
have
some
reason
for
sitting
there
so
long
and
so
silent
without
speaking
a
word
or
taking
his
eyes
off
the
fire
barry
had
all
but
made
up
his
mind
to
ask
the
aid
he
wanted
but
he
felt
that
he
was
not
prepared
to
do
so
that
he
should
soon
quiver
and
shake
that
he
could
not
then
carry
it
through
he
felt
that
he
wanted
spirit
to
undertake
his
own
part
in
the
business
much
less
to
inspire
another
with
the
will
to
assist
him
in
it
at
last
he
rose
abruptly
from
his
chair
and
said
will
you
dine
with
me
colligan
i
so
down
in
the
mouth
so
deucedly
hipped
it
will
be
a
charity
well
said
colligan
i
do
care
if
i
do
i
must
go
down
to
your
sister
in
the
evening
and
i
shall
be
near
her
here
yes
of
course
you
be
near
her
here
as
you
say
come
at
six
then
by
the
bye
could
you
go
to
anty
first
so
that
we
wo
be
disturbed
over
our
punch
i
must
see
her
the
last
thing
about
nine
but
i
can
look
up
again
afterwards
for
a
minute
or
so
i
do
stay
long
with
her
now
better
not
well
then
you
be
here
at
six
yes
six
sharp
and
at
last
the
doctor
got
up
and
went
away
it
was
odd
that
doctor
colligan
should
have
sat
thus
long
it
showed
a
great
want
of
character
and
of
good
feeling
in
him
he
should
never
have
become
intimate
or
even
have
put
up
with
a
man
expressing
such
wishes
as
those
which
so
often
fell
from
barry
lips
but
he
was
entirely
innocent
of
the
thoughts
which
barry
attributed
to
him
it
had
never
even
occurred
to
him
that
barry
bad
as
he
was
would
wish
to
murder
his
sister
no
bad
heedless
sensual
as
doctor
colligan
might
be
barry
was
a
thousand
fathoms
deeper
in
iniquity
than
he
as
soon
as
he
had
left
the
room
the
other
uttered
a
long
deep
sigh
it
was
a
great
relief
to
him
to
be
alone
he
could
now
collect
his
thoughts
mature
his
plans
and
finally
determine
he
took
his
usual
remedy
in
his
difficulties
a
glass
of
brandy
and
going
out
into
the
garden
walked
up
and
down
the
gravel
walk
almost
unconsciously
for
above
an
hour
yes
he
would
do
it
he
would
not
be
a
coward
the
thing
had
been
done
a
thousand
times
before
had
he
heard
of
it
over
and
over
again
besides
colligan
manner
was
an
assurance
to
him
that
he
would
not
boggle
at
such
a
job
but
then
of
course
he
must
be
paid
and
barry
began
to
calculate
how
much
he
must
offer
for
the
service
and
when
the
service
should
be
performed
how
he
might
avoid
the
fulfilment
of
his
portion
of
the
bargain
he
went
in
and
ordered
the
dinner
filled
the
spirit
decanters
opened
a
couple
of
bottles
of
wine
and
then
walked
out
again
in
giving
his
orders
and
doing
the
various
little
things
with
which
he
had
to
keep
himself
employed
everybody
and
everything
seemed
strange
to
him
he
hardly
knew
what
he
was
about
and
felt
almost
as
though
he
were
in
a
dream
he
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
as
to
what
he
would
do
his
resolution
was
fixed
to
carry
it
through
but
still
there
was
the
but
how
was
he
to
open
it
to
doctor
colligan
he
walked
up
and
down
the
gravel
path
for
a
long
time
thinking
of
this
or
rather
trying
to
think
of
it
for
his
thoughts
would
fly
away
to
all
manner
of
other
subjects
and
he
continually
found
himself
harping
upon
some
trifle
connected
with
anty
but
wholly
irrespective
of
her
death
some
little
thing
that
she
had
done
for
him
or
ought
to
have
done
something
she
had
said
a
long
time
ago
and
which
he
had
never
thought
of
till
now
something
she
had
worn
and
which
at
the
time
he
did
not
even
know
that
he
had
observed
and
as
often
as
he
found
his
mind
thus
wandering
he
would
start
off
at
a
quicker
pace
and
again
endeavour
to
lay
out
a
line
of
conduct
for
the
evening
at
last
however
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
be
better
to
trust
to
the
chapter
of
chances
there
was
one
thing
or
rather
two
things
he
could
certainly
do
he
could
make
the
doctor
half
drunk
before
he
opened
on
the
subject
and
he
would
take
care
to
be
in
the
same
state
himself
so
he
walked
in
and
sat
still
before
the
fire
for
the
two
long
remaining
hours
which
intervened
before
the
clock
struck
six
it
was
about
noon
when
the
doctor
left
him
and
during
those
six
long
solitary
hours
no
one
feeling
of
remorse
had
entered
his
breast
he
had
often
doubted
hesitated
as
to
the
practicability
of
his
present
plan
but
not
once
had
he
made
the
faintest
effort
to
overcome
the
wish
to
have
the
deed
done
there
was
not
one
moment
in
which
he
would
not
most
willingly
have
had
his
sister
blood
upon
his
hands
upon
his
brain
upon
his
soul
could
he
have
willed
and
accomplished
her
death
without
making
himself
liable
to
the
penalties
of
the
law
at
length
doctor
colligan
came
and
barry
made
a
great
effort
to
appear
unconcerned
and
in
good
humour
and
how
is
she
now
doctor
he
said
as
they
sat
down
to
table
is
it
anty
why
you
know
i
did
mean
to
see
her
since
i
was
here
this
morning
till
nine
oh
true
so
you
were
saying
i
forgot
well
will
you
take
a
glass
of
wine
and
barry
filled
his
own
glass
quite
full
he
drank
his
wine
at
dinner
like
a
glutton
who
had
only
a
short
time
allowed
him
and
wished
during
that
time
to
swallow
as
much
as
possible
and
he
tried
to
hurry
his
companion
in
the
same
manner
but
the
doctor
did
choose
to
have
wine
forced
down
his
throat
he
wished
to
enjoy
himself
and
remonstrated
against
barry
violent
hospitality
at
last
dinner
was
over
the
things
were
taken
away
they
both
drew
their
chairs
over
the
fire
and
began
the
business
of
the
evening
the
making
and
consumption
of
punch
barry
had
determined
to
begin
upon
the
subject
which
lay
so
near
his
heart
at
eight
he
had
thought
it
better
to
fix
an
exact
hour
and
had
calculated
that
the
whole
matter
might
be
completed
before
colligan
went
over
to
the
inn
he
kept
continually
looking
at
his
watch
and
gulping
down
his
drink
and
thinking
over
and
over
again
how
he
would
begin
the
conversation
you
very
comfortable
here
lynch
said
the
doctor
stretching
his
long
legs
before
the
fire
and
putting
his
dirty
boots
upon
the
fender
yes
indeed
said
barry
not
knowing
what
the
other
was
saying
all
you
want
a
wife
and
you
have
as
warm
a
house
as
there
is
in
galway
you
be
marrying
soon
i
suppose
well
i
would
wonder
if
i
did
you
do
take
your
punch
brandy
there
if
you
like
it
better
than
whiskey
this
is
very
good
thank
you
could
be
better
you
have
much
land
in
your
own
hands
have
you
why
no
i
do
think
i
have
what
that
you
saying
land
no
not
much
if
there
a
thing
i
hate
it
farming
well
upon
my
word
you
wrong
i
do
see
what
else
a
gentleman
has
to
do
in
the
country
i
wish
to
goodness
i
could
give
up
the
gallipots
and
farm
a
few
acres
of
my
own
land
there
nothing
i
wish
so
much
as
to
get
a
bit
of
land
indeed
i
been
looking
out
for
it

so
difficult

get

gallipots
a
gallipot
was
a
small
ceramic
vessel
used
by
apothecaries
to
hold
medicines
the
term
was
also
used
colloquially
to
refer
to
apothecaries
themselves
and
even
physicians
trollope
so
uses
the
term
in
later
chapters
up
to
this
barry
had
hardly
listened
to
what
the
doctor
had
been
saying
but
now
he
was
all
attention
so
that
is
to
be
his
price
thought
he
to
himself
he
cost
me
dear
but
i
suppose
he
must
have
it
barry
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
near
eight
but
he
seemed
to
feel
that
all
he
had
drank
had
had
no
effect
on
him
it
had
not
given
him
the
usual
pluck
it
had
not
given
him
the
feeling
of
reckless
assurance
which
he
mistook
for
courage
and
capacity

you
a
mind
to
be

and
then
he
remained
silent
for
a
minute
what
an
opportunity
this
was
for
him
to
lose
colligan
so
evidently
wished
to
be
bribed
so
clearly
showed
what
the
price
was
which
was
to
purchase
him
but
still
he
could
not
ask
the
fatal
question
again
he
sat
silent
for
a
while
till
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
found
it
was
a
quarter
past
eight
never
fear
he
said
referring
to
the
farm
you
shall
have
it
and
it
shall
not
be
the
worst
land
on
the
estate
that
i
give
you
you
may
be
sure
for
upon
my
soul
i
have
a
great
regard
for
you
i
have
indeed
the
doctor
thanked
him
for
his
good
opinion
oh
i
not
blarneying
you
upon
my
soul
i
not
that
not
the
way
with
me
at
all
and
when
you
know
me
better
you
say
so
and
you
may
be
sure
you
shall
have
the
farm
by
michaelmas
and
then
in
a
voice
which
he
tried
to
make
as
unconcerned
as
possible
he
continued
by
the
bye
colligan
when
do
you
think
this
affair
of
anty
be
over
it

devil
and
all
for
a
man

to
know
when
he
be

oh
you
must
calculate
on
your

at
all
now
said
the
other
in
an
altered
voice
i
tell
you
it
very
probable
she
may
recover

silenced
barry
and
he
let
the
time
go
by
till
the
doctor
took
up
his
hat
to
go
down
to
his
patient
you
not
be
long
i
suppose
said
barry
well
it
getting
late
said
colligan
and
i
do
think
i
be
coming
back
oh
but
you
will
indeed
you
must
you
promised
you
would
you
know
and
i
want
to
hear
how
she
goes
on
well
i
just
come
up
but
i
wo
stay
for
i
promised
mrs
colligan
to
be
home
early
this
was
always
the
doctor
excuse
when
he
wished
to
get
away
he
never
allowed
his
domestic
promises
to
draw
him
home
when
there
was
anything
to
induce
him
to
stay
abroad
but
to
tell
the
truth
he
was
getting
rather
sick
of
his
companion
the
doctor
took
his
hat
and
went
to
his
patient
he
not
be
above
ten
minutes
or
at
any
rate
a
quarter
of
an
hour
thought
barry
and
then
i
must
do
it
how
he
sucked
it
all
in
about
the
farm
that
the
trap
certainly
and
he
stood
leaning
with
his
back
against
the
and
his
hanging
over
his
arm
waiting
for
and
yet
fearing
the
moment
of
the
return
it
seemed
an
age
since
he
went
barry
looked
at
his
watch
almost
every
minute
it
was
twenty
minutes
past
nine
thirty
forty
three
quarters
of
an
hour
by
heaven
said
he
the
man
is
not
coming
he
is
going
to
desert
me
and
i
shall
be
ruined
why
the
deuce
did
i
speak
out
when
the
man
was
here
at
last
his
ear
caught
the
sound
of
the
doctor
heavy
foot
on
the
gravel
outside
the
door
and
immediately
afterwards
the
door
bell
was
rung
barry
hastily
poured
out
a
glass
of
raw
spirits
and
swallowed
it
he
then
threw
himself
into
his
chair
and
doctor
colligan
again
entered
the
room
what
a
time
you
been
colligan
why
i
thought
you
were
coming
all
night
now
terry
some
hot
water
and
mind
you
look
sharp
about
it
well
how
anty
weak
very
weak
but
mending
i
think
the
disease
wo
kill
her
now
the
only
thing
is
whether
the
cure
will
well
doctor
you
ca
expect
me
to
be
very
anxious
about
it
unfortunately
we
had
never
any
reason
to
be
proud
of
anty
and
it
would
be
humbug
in
me
to
pretend
that
i
wish
she
should
recover
to
rob
me
of
what
you
know
i
every
right
to
consider
my
own
terry
brought
the
hot
water
in
and
left
the
room
well
i
ca
say
you
do
appear
very
anxious
about
it
i
just
swallow
one
dandy
of
punch
and
then
i
get
home
i
later
now
than
i
meant
to
be
nonsense
man
the
idea
of
your
being
in
a
hurry
when
everybody
knows
that
a
doctor
can
never
tell
how
long
he
may
be
kept
in
a
but
come
now
tell
the
truth
put
yourself
in
my
condition
and
do
you
mean
to
say
you
be
very
anxious
that
anty
should
recover
would
you
like
your
own
sister
to
rise
from
her
to
rob
you
of
everything
you
have
for
by
heaven
it
is
robbery
nothing
less
so
that
there
no
making
any
arrangement
with
her
tried
everything
fair
means
and
foul
and
nothing
do
but
she
must
go
and
marry
that
low
young
kelly
so
immeasurably
beneath
her
you
know
and
of
course
only
scheming
for
her
money
put
yourself
in
my
place
i
say
and
tell
me
fairly
what
your
own
wishes
would
be
i
was
always
fond
of
my
brothers
and
sisters
answered
the
doctor
and
we
could
well
rob
each
other
for
none
of
us
had
a
penny
to
lose
that
a
different
thing
but
just
supposing
you
were
exactly
in
my
shoes
at
this
moment
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
be
glad
she
should
get
well
that
you
be
glad
she
should
be
able
to
deprive
you
of
your
property
disgrace
your
family
drive
you
from
your
own
home
and
make
your
life
miserable
for
ever
after
upon
my
soul
i
ca
say
but
good
night
now
you
getting
excited
and
i
finished
my
drop
of
punch
ah
nonsense
man
sit
down
i
something
in
earnest
i
want
to
say
to
you
and
barry
got
up
and
prevented
the
doctor
from
leaving
the
room
colligan
had
gone
so
far
as
to
put
on
his
hat
and
great
coat
and
now
sat
down
again
without
taking
them
off
you
and
i
colligan
are
men
of
the
world
and
too
wide
awake
for
all
the
old
woman
nonsense
people
talk
what
can
i
or
what
could
you
in
my
place
care
for
a
old
maid
like
anty
who
better
dead
than
alive
for
her
own
sake
and
everybody
else
unless
it
is
some
scheming
ruffian
like
young
kelly
there
who
wants
to
make
money
by
her
i
not
asking
you
to
care
for
her
only
if
those
are
your
ideas
it
as
well
not
to
talk
about
them
for
appearance
sake
appearance
sake
there
nothing
makes
me
so
sick
as
for
two
men
like
you
and
me
who
know
what
what
to
be
talking
about
appearance
sake
like
two
confounded
parsons
whose
business
it
is
to
humbug
everybody
and
themselves
into
the
bargain
i
tell
you
what
had
my
father
bad
luck
to
him
for
an
old
rogue
not
made
such
a
will
as
he
did
i
treated
anty
as
well
as
any
parson
of
all
would
treat
an
old
maid
of
a
sister
but
i
not
going
to
have
her
put
over
my
head
this
way
come
doctor
confound
all
humbug
i
say
it
openly
to
you
to
please
me
anty
must
never
come
out
of
that
bed
alive
as
if
your
wishes
could
make
any
difference
if
it
is
to
be
so
die
poor
creature
without
your
saying
so
much
about
it
but
and
it
very
likely
too
she
be
alive
and
strong
after
the
two
of
us
are
under
the
sod
well
if
it
must
be
so
it
must
but
what
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
is
this
while
you
were
away
i
was
thinking
about
what
you
said
of
the
farm
of
being
a
tenant
of
mine
you
know
we
can
talk
about
that
another
time
said
the
doctor
who
began
to
feel
an
excessive
wish
to
be
out
of
the
house
there
no
time
like
the
present
when
i
got
it
in
my
mind
and
if
you
wait
i
can
settle
it
all
for
you
i
was
telling
you
that
i
hate
farming
and
so
i
do
there
are
thirty
or
acres
of
land
about
the
house
and
lying
round
to
the
back
of
the
town
you
shall
take
them
off
my
hands
and
welcome
this
was
too
good
an
offer
to
be
resisted
and
colligan
said
he
would
take
the
land
with
many
thanks
if
the
rent
any
way
suited
him
we
not
quarrel
about
that
you
may
be
sure
colligan
continued
barry
and
as
i
said
fifty
acres
at
first
it
was
fifty
acres
i
think
you
were
saying
you
wished
for
i
not
baulk
you
and
go
back
from
my
own
word
what
you
have
yourself
round
the
house
be
enough
only
thinking
the
rent
be
too
high
it
shall
not
it
shall
be
low
enough
and
as
i
was
saying
you
shall
have
the
remainder
at
the
same
price
immediately
after
michaelmas
as
soon
as
ever
those
devils
are
ejected
well
said
colligan
who
was
now
really
interested
what
the
figure
barry
had
been
looking
steadfastly
at
the
fire
during
the
whole
conversation
up
to
this
playing
with
the
poker
and
knocking
the
coals
about
he
was
longing
to
look
into
the
other
face
but
he
did
not
dare
now
however
was
his
time
it
was
now
or
never
he
took
one
furtive
glance
at
the
doctor
and
saw
that
he
was
really
anxious
on
the
subject
that
his
attention
was
fixed
the
figure
said
he
the
figure
should
not
trouble
you
if
you
had
no
one
but
me
to
deal
with
but
there
be
anty
confound
her
putting
her
fist
into
this
and
every
other
plan
of
mine
i
better
deal
with
the
agent
i
thinking
said
colligan
so
good
night
you
find
you
a
deal
better
be
dealing
with
me
you
never
find
an
easier
fellow
to
deal
with
or
one
who
put
a
better
thing
in
your
way
colligan
again
sat
down
he
could
quite
make
barry
out
he
suspected
he
was
planning
some
iniquity
but
he
could
tell
what
and
he
remained
silent
looking
full
into
the
other
face
till
he
should
go
on
barry
winced
under
the
look
and
hesitated
but
at
last
he
screwed
himself
up
to
the
point
and
said
one
word
between
two
friends
is
as
good
as
a
thousand
if
anty
dies
of
this
bout
you
shall
have
the
fifty
acres
with
a
lease
for
perpetuity
at
sixpence
an
acre
come
that
not
a
high
figure
i
think
what
said
colligan
apparently
not
understanding
him
a
lease
for
perpetuity
at
how
much
an
acre
sixpence
a
penny
a
just
anything
you
please
but
all
on
anty
dying
while
she
alive
i
can
do
nothing
for
the
best
friend
i
have
by
the
almighty
above
us
said
the
doctor
almost
in
a
whisper
i
believe
the
wretched
man
means
me
to
murder
her
his
own
sister
murder
who
talked
or
said
a
word
of
murder
said
barry
with
a
hoarse
and
croaking
voice
is
she
dying
as
she
is
and
is
she
better
dead
than
alive
it
only
just
not
taking
so
much
trouble
to
keep
the
life
in
her
you
so
exceeding
clever
you
know
and
he
made
a
ghastly
attempt
at
smiling
with
any
other
doctor
she
have
been
dead
long
since
leave
her
to
herself
a
little
and
the
your
own
and
i
sure
there
been
nothing
at
all
like
murder
between
us
by
heavens
he
does
and
colligan
rose
quickly
from
his
seat
he
means
to
have
her
murdered
and
thinks
to
make
me
do
the
deed
why
you
vile
thieving
murdering
reptile
and
as
he
spoke
the
doctor
seized
him
by
the
throat
and
shook
him
violently
in
his
strong
grasp
who
told
you
i
was
a
fit
person
for
such
a
plan
who
told
you
to
come
to
me
for
such
a
deed
who
told
you
i
would
sell
my
soul
for
your
paltry
land
and
he
continued
grasping
barry
throat
till
he
was
black
in
the
face
and
nearly
choked
merciful
heaven
that
i
should
have
sat
here
and
listened
to
such
a
scheme
take
care
of
yourself
said
he
and
he
threw
him
violently
backwards
over
the
chairs
if
you
to
be
found
in
connaught
or
in
ireland
the
next
day
i
hang
you
and
so
saying
he
hurried
out
of
the
room
and
went
home
well
thought
he
on
his
road
i
have
heard
of
such
men
as
that
before
and
i
believe
that
when
i
was
young
i
read
of
such
but
i
never
expected
to
meet
so
black
a
villain
what
had
i
better
do
if
i
go
and
swear
an
information
before
a
magistrate
there
be
nothing
but
my
word
and
his
besides
he
said
nothing
that
the
law
could
take
hold
of
and
yet
i
ought
to
let
it
pass
at
any
rate
i
sleep
on
it
and
so
he
did
but
it
was
not
for
a
long
time
for
the
recollection
of
barry
hideous
proposal
kept
him
awake
barry
lay
sprawling
among
the
chairs
till
the
sound
of
the
hall
door
closing
told
him
that
his
guest
had
gone
when
he
slowly
picked
himself
up
and
sat
down
upon
the
sofa
colligan
last
words
were
ringing
in
his
ear
if
you
found
in
ireland
the
next
day
i
hang
you
hang
him
and
had
he
really
given
any
one
the
power
to
speak
to
him
in
such
language
as
that
after
all
what
had
he
said
he
had
not
even
whispered
a
word
of
murder
he
had
only
made
an
offer
of
what
he
would
do
if
anty
should
die
besides
no
one
but
themselves
had
heard
even
that
and
then
his
thoughts
went
off
to
another
train
who
have
thought
he
said
to
himself
the
man
was
such
a
fool
he
meant
it
at
first
as
well
as
i
did
myself
i
sure
he
did
he
never
have
caught
as
he
did
about
the
farm
else
only
he
got
afraid
the
confounded
fool
as
for
hanging
i
let
him
know
it
just
as
easy
for
me
to
tell
a
story
i
suppose
as
it
is
for
him
and
then
barry
too
dragged
himself
up
to
bed
and
cursed
himself
to
sleep
his
waking
thoughts
however
were
miserable
enough
xxviii
fanny
wyndham
rebels
we
will
now
return
to
grey
abbey
lord
cashel
and
that
unhappy
heiress
his
ward
fanny
wyndham
affairs
there
had
taken
no
turn
to
give
increased
comfort
either
to
the
earl
or
to
his
niece
during
the
month
which
succeeded
the
news
of
young
harry
death
the
former
still
adhered
with
fixed
pertinacity
of
purpose
to
the
matrimonial
arrangement
which
he
had
made
with
his
son
circumstances
indeed
rendered
it
even
much
more
necessary
in
the
earl
eyes
than
it
had
appeared
to
be
when
he
first
contemplated
this
scheme
for
releasing
himself
from
his
son
pecuniary
difficulties
he
had
as
the
reader
will
remember
advanced
a
very
large
sum
of
money
to
lord
kilcullen
to
be
repaid
out
of
fanny
wyndham
fortune
this
money
lord
kilcullen
had
certainly
appropriated
in
the
manner
intended
by
his
father
but
it
had
anything
but
the
effect
of
quieting
the
creditors
the
payments
were
sufficiently
large
to
make
the
whole
hungry
crew
hear
that
his
lordship
was
paying
his
debts
but
not
at
all
sufficient
to
satisfy
their
craving
indeed
nearly
the
whole
went
in
liquidation
of
turf
engagements
and
gambling
debts
the
jews
and
tradesmen
merely
heard
that
money
was
going
from
lord
kilcullen
pocket
but
with
all
their
exertions
they
got
very
little
of
it
themselves
consequently
claims
of
all
kinds
bills
duns
remonstrances
and
threats
poured
in
not
only
upon
the
son
but
also
upon
the
father
the
latter
it
is
true
was
not
in
his
own
person
liable
for
one
penny
of
them
nor
could
he
well
on
his
own
score
be
said
to
be
an
embarrassed
man
but
he
was
not
the
less
uneasy
he
had
determined
if
possible
to
extricate
his
son
once
more
and
as
a
preliminary
step
had
himself
already
raised
a
large
sum
of
money
which
it
would
much
trouble
him
to
pay
and
he
moreover
as
he
frequently
said
to
lord
kilcullen
would
not
and
could
not
pay
another
penny
for
the
same
purpose
until
he
saw
a
tolerably
sure
prospect
of
being
repaid
out
of
his
ward
fortune
he
was
therefore
painfully
anxious
on
the
subject
anxious
not
only
that
the
matter
should
be
arranged
but
that
it
should
be
done
at
once
it
was
plain
that
lord
kilcullen
could
not
remain
in
london
for
he
would
be
arrested
the
same
thing
would
happen
at
grey
abbey
if
he
were
to
remain
there
long
without
settling
his
affairs
and
if
he
were
once
to
escape
his
creditors
by
going
abroad
there
would
be
no
such
thing
as
getting
him
back
again
lord
cashel
saw
no
good
reason
why
there
should
be
any
delay
harry
wyndham
was
dead
above
a
month
and
fanny
was
evidently
grieving
more
for
the
loss
of
her
lover
than
that
of
her
brother
she
naturally
felt
alone
in
the
world
and
as
lord
cashel
thought
one
young
viscount
would
be
just
as
good
as
another
the
advantages
too
were
much
in
favour
of
his
son
he
would
one
day
be
an
earl
and
possess
grey
abbey
so
great
an
accession
of
grandeur
dignity
and
rank
could
not
but
be
as
the
earl
considered
very
delightful
to
a
sensible
girl
like
his
ward
the
marriage
of
course
need
be
much
hurried
four
or
five
months
time
would
do
for
that
he
was
only
anxious
that
they
should
be
engaged
that
lord
kilcullen
should
be
absolutely
accepted
lord
ballindine
finally
rejected
the
earl
certainly
felt
some
scruples
of
conscience
at
the
sacrifice
he
was
making
of
his
ward
and
stronger
still
respecting
his
fortune
but
he
appeased
them
with
the
reflection
that
if
his
son
were
a
gambler
a
and
a
scamp
lord
ballindine
was
probably
just
as
bad
and
that
if
the
latter
were
to
spend
all
fanny
money
there
would
be
no
chance
of
redemption
whereas
he
could
at
any
rate
settle
on
his
wife
a
jointure
which
would
be
a
full
compensation
for
the
loss
of
her
fortune
should
she
outlive
her
husband
and
besides
he
looked
on
lord
kilcullen
faults
as
a
father
is
generally
inclined
to
look
on
those
of
a
son
whom
he
had
not
entirely
given
up
whom
he
is
still
striving
to
redeem
he
called
his
iniquitous
vices
follies
his
licentiousness
love
of
pleasure
his
unprincipled
expenditure
and
extravagance
a
want
of
the
knowledge
of
what
money
was
and
his
worst
sin
of
all
because
the
one
least
likely
to
be
abandoned
his
positive
unyielding
damning
selfishness
he
called
fashion
the
fashion
of
the
young
men
of
the
day
poor
lord
cashel
he
wished
to
be
honest
to
his
ward
and
yet
to
save
his
son
and
his
own
pocket
at
the
same
time
at
her
expense
he
wished
to
be
in
his
own
estimation
honourable
and
disinterested
and
yet
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
be
generous
to
his
own
flesh
and
blood
at
the
expense
of
another
the
contest
within
him
made
him
miserable
but
the
devil
and
mammon
were
too
strong
for
him
particularly
coming
as
they
did
half
hidden
beneath
the
gloss
of
parental
affection
there
was
little
of
the
roman
about
the
earl
and
he
could
not
condemn
his
own
son
so
he
fumed
and
fretted
and
twisted
himself
about
in
the
easy
chair
in
his
dingy
and
passed
long
hours
in
trying
to
persuade
himself
that
it
was
for
fanny
advantage
that
he
was
going
to
make
her
lady
kilcullen
he
might
have
saved
himself
all
his
anxiety
fanny
wyndham
had
much
too
strong
a
mind
much
too
marked
a
character
of
her
own
to
be
made
lady
anything
by
lord
anybody
lord
cashel
might
possibly
prevent
her
from
marrying
frank
especially
as
she
had
been
weak
enough
through
pique
and
anger
to
lend
him
her
name
for
dismissing
him
but
neither
he
nor
anyone
else
could
make
her
accept
one
man
while
she
loved
another
and
while
that
other
was
unmarried
since
the
interview
between
fanny
and
her
uncle
and
aunt
which
has
been
recorded
she
had
been
nearly
as
uncomfortable
as
lord
cashel
and
she
had
to
a
certain
extent
made
the
whole
household
as
much
so
as
herself
not
that
there
was
anything
of
the
character
in
fanny
composition
but
that
the
natural
disposition
of
grey
abbey
and
all
belonging
to
it
was
to
be
dull
solemn
slow
and
respectable
fanny
alone
had
ever
given
any
life
to
the
place
or
made
the
house
tolerable
and
her
secession
to
the
ranks
of
the
sombre
crew
was
therefore
the
more
remarked
if
fanny
moped
all
grey
abbey
might
figuratively
be
said
to
hang
down
its
head
lady
cashel
was
in
every
sense
of
the
words
continually
wrapped
up
in
wools
and
worsteds
the
earl
was
always
equally
ponderous
and
the
specific
gravity
of
lady
selina
could
not
be
calculated
it
was
beyond
the
power
of
figures
even
in
algebraic
denominations
to
describe
her
moral
weight
and
now
fanny
did
mope
and
grey
abbey
was
triste
indeed
griffiths
in
my
lady
boudoir
rolled
and
unrolled
those
huge
white
bundles
of
mysterious
fleecy
hosiery
with
more
than
usually
slow
and
unbroken
perseverance
my
lady
herself
bewailed
the
fermentation
among
the
with
a
voice
that
did
more
than
whine
it
was
almost
funereal
as
my
lord
went
from
to
from
to
and
from
to
his
footsteps
creaked
with
a
sound
more
deadly
than
that
of
a
the
itself
had
caught
a
darker
gloom
the
backs
of
the
books
seemed
to
have
lost
their
gilding
and
the
mahogany
furniture
its
french
polish
there
like
a
god
lord
cashel
sate
alone
throned
amid
clouds
of
awful
dulness
ruling
the
world
of
nothingness
around
by
the
silent
solemnity
of
his
inertia
footnote
triste

lady
selina
was
always
useful
but
with
a
solid
slow
activity
a
dignified
intensity
of
heavy
perseverance
which
made
her
perhaps
more
intolerable
than
her
father
she
was
like
some
old
coaches
which
we
remember
very
sure
very
respectable
but
so
tedious
so
monotonous
so
heavy
in
their
motion
that
a
man
with
a
spark
of
mercury
in
his
composition
would
prefer
any
danger
from
a
faster
vehicle
to
their
horrid
weary
murderous
slow
security
lady
selina
from
day
to
day
performed
her
duties
in
a
most
uncompromising
manner
she
knew
what
was
due
to
her
position
and
from
it
and
exacted
and
performed
accordingly
with
a
stiff
steady
propriety
which
made
her
an
awful
if
not
a
hateful
creature
one
of
her
daily
duties
and
one
for
the
performance
of
which
she
had
unfortunately
ample
opportunity
was
the
consolation
of
fanny
under
her
troubles
poor
fanny
how
great
an
aggravation
was
this
to
her
other
miseries
for
a
considerable
time
lady
selma
had
known
nothing
of
the
true
cause
of
fanny
gloom
for
though
the
two
cousins
were
good
friends
as
far
as
lady
selina
was
capable
of
admitting
so
human
a
frailty
as
friendship
still
fanny
could
not
bring
herself
to
make
a
confidante
of
her
her
kind
stupid
unpretending
old
aunt
was
a
much
better
person
to
talk
to
even
though
she
did
arch
her
eyebrows
and
shake
her
head
when
lord
ballindine
name
was
mentioned
and
assure
her
niece
that
though
she
had
always
liked
him
herself
he
could
not
be
good
for
much
because
lord
kilcullen
had
said
so
but
fanny
could
not
well
dissemble
she
was
tormented
by
lady
condolements
and
recommendations
of
gibbon
her
encomiums
on
industry
and
anathemas
against
idleness
she
was
so
often
reminded
that
weeping
would
not
bring
back
her
brother
nor
inactive
reflection
make
his
fate
less
certain
that
at
last
she
made
her
monitor
understand
that
it
was
about
lord
ballindine
fate
that
she
was
anxious
and
that
it
was
his
coming
back
which
might
be
effected
by
weeping
or
other
measures
lady
selina
was
shocked
by
such
feminine
girlish
weakness
such
want
of
dignity
and
character
such
forgetfulness
as
she
said
to
fanny
of
what
was
due
to
her
own
position
lady
selina
was
herself
unmarried
and
not
likely
to
marry
and
why
had
she
maintained
her
virgin
state
and
foregone
the
blessings
of
love
and
matrimony
because
as
she
often
said
to
herself
and
occasionally
said
to
fanny
she
would
not
step
down
from
the
lofty
pedestal
on
which
it
had
pleased
fortune
and
birth
to
place
her
she
learned
however
by
degrees
to
forgive
though
she
approve
fanny
weakness
she
remembered
that
it
was
a
very
different
thing
to
be
an
earl
niece
and
an
earl
daughter
and
that
the
same
conduct
could
not
be
expected
from
fanny
wyndham
and
lady
selina
grey
the
two
were
sitting
together
in
one
of
the
grey
abbey
about
the
middle
of
april
fanny
had
that
morning
again
been
talking
to
her
guardian
on
the
subject
nearest
to
her
heart
and
had
nearly
distracted
him
by
begging
him
to
take
steps
to
make
frank
understand
that
a
renewal
of
his
visits
at
grey
abbey
would
not
be
ill
received
lord
cashel
at
first
tried
to
frighten
her
out
of
her
project
by
silence
frowns
and
looks
but
not
finding
himself
successful
he
commenced
a
long
oration
in
which
he
broke
down
or
rather
which
he
had
to
cut
up
into
sundry
short
speeches
in
which
he
endeavoured
to
make
it
appear
that
lord
ballindine
expulsion
had
originated
with
fanny
herself
and
that
banished
or
not
banished
the
less
fanny
had
to
do
with
him
the
better
his
ward
however
declared
in
rather
a
tempestuous
manner
that
if
she
could
not
see
him
at
grey
abbey
she
would
see
him
elsewhere
and
his
lordship
was
obliged
to
capitulate
by
promising
that
if
frank
were
unmarried
in
twelve
months
time
and
fanny
should
then
still
be
of
the
same
mind
he
would
consent
to
the
match
and
use
his
influence
to
bring
it
about
this
by
no
means
satisfied
fanny
but
it
was
all
that
the
earl
would
say
and
she
had
now
to
consider
whether
she
would
accept
those
terms
or
act
for
herself
had
she
had
any
idea
what
steps
she
could
with
propriety
take
in
opposition
to
the
earl
she
would
have
withdrawn
herself
and
her
fortune
from
his
house
and
hands
without
any
scruples
of
conscience
but
what
was
she
to
do
she
could
write
to
her
lover
and
ask
him
to
come
back
to
her
whither
could
she
go
she
could
well
set
up
house
for
herself
lady
selina
was
bending
over
her
and
penning
most
decorous
notes
with
a
precision
of
calligraphy
which
it
was
painful
to
witness
she
was
writing
orders
to
dublin
tradesmen
and
each
order
might
have
been
printed
in
the
complete
as
a
specimen
of
the
manner
in
which
young
ladies
should
address
such
correspondents
fanny
had
a
volume
of
french
poetry
in
her
hand
but
had
it
been
greek
prose
it
would
have
given
her
equal
occupation
and
amusement
it
had
been
in
her
hands
and
she
had
not
read
a
line
fanny
said
lady
selina
raising
up
her
thin
red
spiral
tresses
from
her
desk
and
speaking
in
a
firm
decided
tone
as
if
well
assured
of
the
importance
of
the
question
she
was
going
to
put
do
you
want
some
things
from
ellis
from
where
selina
said
fanny
slightly
starting
from
ellis
repeated
lady
selina
oh
the
man
in
grafton
no
thank
you
and
fanny
returned
to
her
thoughts
surely
you
do
fanny
said
her
ladyship
i
sure
you
want
black
crape
you
were
saying
so
on
friday
last
was
i
yes
i
think
i
do
it
do
another
time
selina
never
mind
now
you
had
better
have
it
in
the
parcel
he
will
send
if
give
me
the
pattern
and
tell
me
how
much
you
want
i
write
for
it
thank
you
selina
you
very
kind
but
i
wo
mind
it
how
very
foolish
of
you
fanny
you
know
you
want
it
and
then
be
annoyed
about
it
you
better
let
me
order
it
with
the
other
things
very
well
dear
order
it
then
for
me
how
much
will
you
want
you
must
send
the
pattern
too
you
know
indeed
selina
i
do
care
about
having
it
at
all
i
can
do
very
well
without
it
so
do
mind
troubling
yourself
how
very
ridiculous
fanny
you
know
you
want
black
crape
and
you
must
get
it
from
ellis
lady
selina
paused
for
a
reply
and
then
added
in
a
voice
of
sorrowful
rebuke
it
to
save
yourself
the
trouble
of
sending
jane
for
the
pattern
well
selina
perhaps
it
is
do
bother
me
about
it
now
there
a
dear
i
be
more
myself
but
indeed
indeed
i
neither
well
nor
happy
now
not
well
fanny
what
ails
you
oh
nothing
ails
me
that
is
nothing
in
the
doctor
way
i
mean
i
was
you
said
you
were
well
and
people
usually
mean
by
that
that
they
are
but
i
did
mean
it
said
fanny
becoming
almost
irritated
i
only
meant
and
she
paused
and
did
not
finish
her
sentence
lady
selina
wiped
her
pen
in
her
scarlet
embroidered
closed
the
lid
of
her
patent
inkstand
folded
a
piece
of
over
the
note
she
was
writing
pushed
back
the
ruddy
ringlets
from
her
contemplative
forehead
gave
a
slight
sigh
and
turned
herself
towards
her
cousin
with
the
purpose
of
commencing
a
vigorous
lecture
and
by
which
she
hoped
to
exorcise
the
spirit
of
lamentation
from
fanny
breast
and
restore
her
to
a
healthful
activity
in
the
performance
of
this
world
duties
fanny
felt
what
was
coming
she
could
not
fly
so
she
closed
her
book
and
her
eyes
and
prepared
herself
for
endurance
fanny
said
lady
selina
in
a
voice
which
was
intended
to
be
both
severe
and
sorrowful
you
are
giving
way
to
very
foolish
feelings
in
a
very
foolish
way
you
are
preparing
great
unhappiness
for
yourself
and
allowing
your
mind
to
waste
itself
in
uncontrolled
sorrow
in
a
manner
in
a
manner
which
can
not
but
be
ruinously
injurious
my
dear
fanny
why
do
you
do
something
why
do
you
occupy
yourself
you
given
up
your
work
you
given
up
your
music
you
given
up
everything
in
the
shape
of
reading
how
long
fanny
will
you
go
on
in
this
sad
manner
lady
selina
paused
but
as
fanny
did
not
immediately
reply
she
continued
her
speech
i
begged
you
to
go
on
with
your
reading
because
nothing
but
mental
employment
will
restore
your
mind
to
its
proper
tone
i
sure
i
brought
you
the
second
volume
of
gibbon
twenty
times
but
i
do
believe
you
read
a
chapter
this
month
back
how
long
will
you
allow
yourself
to
go
on
in
this
sad
manner
not
long
selina
as
you
say
i
sad
enough
but
is
it
becoming
in
you
fanny
to
grieve
in
this
way
for
a
man
whom
you
yourself
rejected
because
he
was
unworthy
of
you
selina
i
told
you
before
that
such
was
not
the
case
i
believe
him
to
be
perfectly
worthy
of
me
and
of
any
one
much
my
superior
too
but
you
did
reject
him
fanny
you
bade
papa
tell
him
to
discontinue
his
visits
did
you
fanny
felt
that
her
cousin
was
taking
an
unfair
advantage
in
throwing
thus
in
her
teeth
her
own
momentary
folly
in
having
been
partly
persuaded
partly
piqued
into
quarrelling
with
her
lover
and
she
resented
it
as
such
if
i
did
she
said
somewhat
angrily
it
does
not
make
my
grief
any
lighter
to
know
that
i
brought
it
on
myself
no
fanny
but
it
should
show
you
that
the
loss
for
which
you
grieve
is
past
recovery
sorrow
for
which
there
is
no
cure
should
cease
to
be
grieved
for
at
any
rate
openly
if
lord
ballindine
were
to
die
you
would
not
allow
his
death
to
doom
you
to
perpetual
sighs
and
perpetual
inactivity
no
you
then
know
that
grief
was
hopeless
and
recover
but
lord
ballindine
is
not
dead
said
fanny
ah
that
just
the
point
continued
her
ladyship
he
should
be
dead
to
you
to
you
he
should
now
be
just
the
same
as
though
he
were
in
his
grave
you
loved
him
some
time
since
and
accepted
him
but
you
found
your
love
misplaced
unreturned
or
at
any
rate
coldly
returned
though
you
loved
him
you
passed
a
deliberate
judgment
on
him
and
wisely
rejected
him
having
done
so
his
name
should
not
be
on
your
lips
his
form
and
figure
should
be
forgotten
no
thoughts
of
him
should
sully
your
mind
no
love
for
him
should
be
permitted
to
rest
in
your
heart
it
should
be
rooted
out
whatever
the
exertion
may
cost
you
selina
i
believe
you
have
no
heart
yourself
perhaps
as
much
as
yourself
fanny
i
heard
of
some
people
who
were
said
to
be
all
heart
i
flatter
myself
i
am
not
one
of
them
i
trust
i
have
some
mind
to
regulate
my
heart
and
some
conscience
to
prevent
my
sacrificing
my
duties
for
the
sake
of
my
heart
if
you
knew
said
fanny
the
meaning
of
what
love
was
you
know
that
it
can
not
be
given
up
in
a
moment
as
you
suppose
rooted
out
as
you
choose
to
call
it
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
selina
i
choose
to
root
it
out
i
gave
my
word
to
frank
not
twelve
months
since
and
that
with
the
consent
of
every
one
belonging
to
me
i
owned
that
i
loved
him
and
solemnly
assured
him
i
would
always
do
so
i
can
not
and
i
ought
not
and
i
will
not
break
my
word
you
would
think
of
nothing
but
what
you
call
your
own
dignity
i
will
not
give
up
my
own
happiness
and
i
firmly
believe
his
too
for
anything
so
empty
do
be
angry
with
me
fanny
said
lady
selina
my
regard
for
your
dignity
arises
only
from
my
affection
for
you
i
should
be
sorry
to
see
you
lessen
yourself
in
the
eyes
of
those
around
you
you
must
remember
that
you
can
not
act
as
another
girl
might
whose
position
was
less
exalted
miss
might
cry
for
her
lost
lover
till
she
got
him
back
again
or
got
another
and
no
one
would
be
the
wiser
and
she
would
not
be
the
worse
but
you
can
not
do
that
rank
and
station
are
in
themselves
benefits
but
they
require
more
rigid
conduct
much
more
control
over
the
feelings
than
is
necessary
in
a
humbler
position
you
should
always
remember
fanny
that
much
is
expected
from
those
to
whom
much
is
given
and
i
to
be
miserable
all
my
life
because
i
not
a
daughter
like
miss
god
forbid
fanny
if
you
employ
your
time
engage
your
mind
and
cease
to
think
of
lord
ballindine
you
soon
cease
to
be
miserable
yes
though
you
might
never
again
feel
the
happiness
of
loving
you
might
still
be
far
from
miserable
but
i
ca
cease
to
think
of
him
selina
i
wo
even
try
then
fanny
i
truly
pity
you
no
selina
it
i
that
pity
you
said
fanny
roused
to
energy
as
different
thoughts
crowded
to
her
mind
you
who
think
more
of
your
position
as
an
earl
daughter
an
aristocrat
than
of
your
nature
as
a
woman
thank
heaven
i
not
a
queen
to
be
driven
to
have
other
feelings
than
those
of
my
sex
i
do
love
lord
ballindine
and
if
i
had
the
power
to
cease
to
do
so
this
moment
i
sooner
drown
myself
than
exercise
it
then
why
were
you
weak
enough
to
reject
him
because
i
was
a
weak
wretched
foolish
girl
i
said
it
in
a
moment
of
passion
and
my
uncle
acted
on
it
at
once
without
giving
me
one
minute
for
reflection
without
allowing
me
one
short
hour
to
look
into
my
own
heart
and
find
how
i
was
deceiving
myself
in
thinking
that
i
ought
to
part
from
him
i
told
lord
cashel
in
the
morning
that
i
would
give
him
up
and
before
i
had
time
to
think
of
what
i
had
said
he
had
been
here
and
had
been
turned
out
of
the
house
oh
selina
it
was
very
very
cruel
in
your
father
to
take
me
at
my
word
so
shortly
and
fanny
hid
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
and
burst
into
tears
that
unfair
fanny
it
could
be
cruel
in
him
to
do
for
you
that
which
he
would
have
done
for
his
own
daughter
he
thought
and
thinks
that
lord
ballindine
would
not
make
you
happy
why
should
he
think
so
he
no
business
to
think
so
sobbed
fanny
through
her
tears
who
could
have
a
business
to
think
for
you
if
not
your
guardian
why
did
he
think
so
then
before
he
encouraged
me
to
receive
him
it
was
because
frank
would
do
just
what
he
was
bid
it
was
because
he
would
become
stiff
and
solemn
and
grave
like
like
fanny
was
going
to
make
a
comparison
that
would
not
have
been
flattering
either
to
lady
selina
or
to
her
father
but
she
did
not
quite
forget
herself
and
stopped
short
without
expressing
the
likeness
had
he
spoken
against
him
at
first
i
would
have
obeyed
but
i
will
not
destroy
myself
now
for
his
prejudices
and
fanny
buried
her
face
among
the
pillows
of
the
sofa
and
sobbed
aloud
lady
selina
walked
over
to
the
sofa
and
stood
at
the
head
of
it
bending
over
her
cousin
she
wished
to
say
something
to
soothe
and
comfort
her
but
did
not
know
how
there
was
nothing
soothing
or
comforting
in
her
nature
nothing
soft
in
her
voice
her
manner
was
repulsive
and
almost
unfeeling
and
yet
she
was
not
unfeeling
she
loved
fanny
as
warmly
as
she
was
capable
of
loving
she
would
have
made
almost
any
personal
sacrifice
to
save
her
cousin
from
grief
she
would
were
it
possible
have
borne
her
sorrows
herself
but
she
could
not
unbend
she
could
not
sit
down
by
fanny
side
and
taking
her
hand
say
soft
and
soothing
things
she
could
not
make
her
grief
easier
by
expressing
hope
for
the
future
or
consolation
for
the
past
she
would
have
felt
that
she
was
compromising
truth
by
giving
hope
and
dignity
by
uttering
consolation
for
the
loss
of
that
which
she
considered
better
lost
than
retained
lady
selina
only
recipe
was
endurance
and
occupation
and
at
any
rate
she
practised
what
she
preached
she
was
never
idle
and
she
never
complained
as
she
saw
fanny
grief
and
heard
her
sobs
she
at
first
thought
that
in
mercy
she
should
now
give
up
the
subject
of
the
conversation
but
then
she
reflected
that
such
mercy
might
be
the
greatest
cruelty
and
that
the
truest
kindness
would
be
to
prove
to
fanny
the
hopelessness
of
her
passion
but
fanny
she
said
when
the
other
tears
were
a
little
subsided
it
no
use
either
saying
or
thinking
impossibilities
what
are
you
to
do
you
surely
will
not
willingly
continue
to
indulge
a
hopeless
passion
selina
you
drive
me
mad
if
you
go
on
let
me
have
my
own
way
but
fanny
if
your
own
way
a
bad
way
surely
you
wo
refuse
to
listen
to
reason
you
must
know
that
what
i
say
is
only
from
my
affection
i
want
you
to
look
before
you
i
want
you
to
summon
courage
to
look
forward
and
then
i
sure
your
common
sense
will
tell
you
that
lord
ballindine
can
never
be
anything
to
you
look
here
selina
and
fanny
rose
and
wiped
her
eyes
and
somewhat
composed
her
ruffled
hair
which
she
shook
back
from
her
face
and
forehead
as
she
endeavoured
to
repress
the
palpitation
which
had
followed
her
tears
i
have
looked
forward
and
i
have
determined
what
i
mean
to
do
it
was
your
father
who
brought
me
to
this
by
forcing
me
into
a
childish
quarrel
with
the
man
i
love
i
have
implored
him
almost
on
my
knees
to
invite
lord
ballindine
again
to
grey
abbey
he
has
refused
to
do
so
at
any
rate
for
twelve
months
and
has
he
consented
to
ask
him
at
the
end
of
twelve
months
asked
selina
much
astonished
and
to
tell
the
truth
considerably
shocked
at
this
instance
of
what
she
considered
her
father
weakness
he
might
as
well
have
said
twelve
years
replied
fanny
how
can
i
how
can
any
one
suppose
that
he
should
remain
single
for
my
sake
for
twelve
months
after
being
repelled
without
a
cause
or
without
a
word
of
explanation
without
even
seeing
me
turned
out
of
the
house
and
insulted
in
every
way
no
whatever
he
might
do
i
will
not
wait
twelve
months
i
ask
lord
cashel
once
again
and
then
fanny
paused
for
a
moment
to
consider
in
what
words
she
would
finish
her
declaration
well
fanny
said
selina
waiting
with
eager
expectation
for
final
declaration
for
she
expected
to
hear
her
say
that
she
would
drown
herself
or
lock
herself
up
for
ever
or
do
something
equally
absurd
then
continued
fanny
and
a
deep
blush
covered
her
face
as
she
spoke
i
will
write
to
lord
ballindine
and
tell
him
that
i
am
still
his
own
if
he
chooses
to
take
me
oh
fanny
do
not
say
such
a
horrid
thing
write
to
a
man
and
beg
him
to
accept
you
no
fanny
i
know
you
too
well
at
any
rate
to
believe
that
you
do
that
indeed
indeed
i
will
then
you
disgrace
yourself
for
ever
oh
fanny
though
my
heart
were
breaking
though
i
knew
i
were
dying
for
very
love
i
sooner
have
it
break
i
sooner
die
at
once
than
disgrace
my
sex
by
becoming
a
suppliant
to
a
man
disgrace
selina
and
am
i
not
now
disgraced
have
i
not
given
him
my
solemn
word
have
i
not
pledged
myself
to
him
as
his
wife
have
i
not
sworn
to
him
a
hundred
times
that
my
heart
was
all
his
own
have
i
not
suffered
those
caresses
which
would
have
been
disgraceful
had
i
not
looked
on
myself
as
almost
already
his
bride
and
is
it
no
disgrace
after
that
to
break
my
word
to
throw
him
aside
like
a
glove
that
would
fit
to
treat
him
as
a
servant
that
would
suit
me
to
send
him
a
contemptuous
message
to
be
gone
and
so
to
forget
him
that
i
might
lay
myself
out
for
the
addresses
and
admiration
of
another
could
any
conduct
be
worse
than
that
any
disgrace
deeper
oh
selina
i
shudder
as
i
think
of
it
could
i
ever
bring
my
lips
to
own
affection
for
another
without
being
overwhelmed
with
shame
and
disgrace
and
then
that
the
world
should
say
that
i
had
accepted
and
rejoiced
in
his
love
when
i
was
poor
and
rejected
it
with
scorn
when
i
was
rich
no
i
would
sooner
ten
thousand
times
sooner
my
uncle
should
do
it
for
me
but
if
he
will
not
write
to
frank
i
will
and
though
my
hand
will
shake
and
my
face
will
be
flushed
as
i
do
so
i
shall
never
think
that
i
have
disgraced
myself
and
if
fanny
if
after
that
he
refuses
you
fanny
was
still
standing
and
she
remained
so
for
a
moment
or
two
meditating
her
reply
and
then
she
answered
should
he
do
so
then
i
have
the
alternative
which
you
say
you
would
prefer
then
i
will
endeavour
to
look
forward
to
a
broken
heart
and
death
without
a
complaint
and
without
tears
then
selina
and
she
tried
to
smile
through
the
tears
which
were
again
running
down
her
cheeks
i
come
to
you
and
endeavour
to
borrow
your
stoic
endurance
and
patient
industry
and
as
she
said
so
she
walked
to
the
door
and
escaped
before
lady
selina
had
time
to
reply
xxix
the
countess
of
cashel
in
trouble
after
considerable
negotiation
between
the
father
and
the
son
the
time
was
fixed
for
lord
kilcullen
arrival
at
grey
abbey
the
earl
tried
much
to
accelerate
it
and
the
viscount
was
equally
anxious
to
stave
off
the
evil
day
but
at
last
it
was
arranged
that
on
the
of
april
he
was
to
make
his
appearance
and
that
he
should
commence
his
wooing
as
soon
as
possible
after
that
day
when
this
was
absolutely
fixed
lord
cashel
paid
a
visit
to
his
countess
in
her
boudoir
to
inform
her
of
the
circumstance
and
prepare
her
for
the
expected
guest
he
did
not
however
say
a
word
of
the
purport
of
his
son
visit
he
had
at
one
time
thought
of
telling
the
old
lady
all
about
it
and
bespeaking
her
influence
with
fanny
for
the
furtherance
of
his
plan
but
on
reconsideration
he
reflected
that
his
wife
was
not
the
person
to
be
trusted
with
any
intrigue
so
he
merely
told
her
that
lord
kilcullen
would
be
at
grey
abbey
in
five
days
that
he
would
probably
remain
at
home
a
long
time
that
as
he
was
giving
up
his
london
vices
and
extravagances
and
going
to
reside
at
grey
abbey
he
wished
that
the
house
should
be
made
as
pleasant
for
him
as
possible
that
a
set
of
friends
relatives
and
acquaintances
should
be
asked
to
come
and
stay
there
and
in
short
that
lord
kilcullen
having
been
a
truly
prodigal
son
should
have
a
fatted
calf
prepared
for
his
arrival
all
this
flurried
and
rejoiced
terrified
and
excited
my
lady
exceedingly
in
the
first
place
it
was
so
truly
delightful
that
her
son
should
turn
good
and
proper
and
careful
and
decorous
just
at
the
right
time
of
life
so
exactly
the
thing
that
ought
to
happen
of
course
young
noblemen
were
extravagant
and
wicked
and
lascivious
habitual
breakers
of
the
commandments
and
it
was
their
nature
in
lady
cashel
thoughts
on
the
education
of
young
men
these
evils
were
ranked
with
the
measles
and
hooping
cough
it
was
well
that
they
should
be
gone
through
and
be
done
with
early
in
life
she
had
a
kind
of
hazy
idea
that
an
and
a
gambling
club
were
indispensable
in
fitting
a
young
aristocrat
for
his
future
career
and
i
doubt
whether
she
would
not
have
agreed
to
the
expediency
of
inoculating
a
son
of
hers
with
these
ailments
in
a
mild
degree
vaccinating
him
as
it
were
with
dissipation
in
order
that
he
might
not
catch
the
disease
late
in
life
in
a
violent
and
fatal
form
she
had
not
therefore
made
herself
unhappy
about
her
son
for
a
few
years
after
his
first
entrance
on
a
life
in
london
but
latterly
she
had
begun
to
be
a
little
uneasy
tidings
of
the
great
amount
of
his
debts
reached
even
her
ears
and
moreover
it
was
nearly
time
that
he
should
reform
and
settle
down
during
the
last
twelve
months
she
had
remarked
fully
twelve
times
to
griffiths
that
she
wondered
when
kilcullen
would
marry
and
she
had
even
twice
asked
her
husband
whether
he
did
think
that
such
a
circumstance
would
be
advantageous
she
was
therefore
much
rejoiced
to
hear
that
her
son
was
coming
to
live
at
home
but
then
why
was
it
so
sudden
it
was
quite
proper
that
the
house
should
be
made
a
little
gay
for
his
reception
that
he
be
expected
to
spend
his
evenings
with
no
other
society
than
that
of
his
father
and
mother
his
sister
and
his
cousin
but
how
was
she
to
get
the
house
ready
for
the
people
and
the
people
ready
for
the
house
at
so
very
short
a
notice
what
trouble
also
it
would
be
to
her
neither
she
nor
griffiths
would
know
another
moment
rest
besides
and
the
thought
nearly
drove
her
into
hysterics
where
was
she
to
get
a
new
cook
however
she
promised
her
husband
to
do
her
best
she
received
from
him
a
list
of
people
to
be
invited
and
merely
stipulating
that
she
should
be
required
to
ask
any
one
except
the
parson
of
the
parish
under
a
week
undertook
to
make
the
place
as
bearable
as
possible
to
so
fastidious
and
distinguished
a
person
as
her
own
son
her
first
confidante
was
of
course
griffiths
and
with
her
assistance
the
wool
and
the
worsted
and
the
the
unfinished
vallances
and
interminable
yards
of
fringe
were
put
up
and
rolled
out
of
the
way
and
it
was
then
agreed
that
a
council
should
be
held
to
which
her
ladyship
proposed
to
invite
lady
selina
and
fanny
griffiths
however
advanced
an
opinion
that
the
latter
was
at
present
too
to
be
of
any
use
in
such
a
matter
and
strengthened
her
argument
by
asserting
that
miss
wyndham
had
of
late
been
quite
mumchance
lady
cashel
was
at
first
rather
inclined
to
insist
on
her
niece
being
called
to
the
council
but
griffiths
eloquence
was
too
strong
and
her
judgment
too
undoubted
so
fanny
was
left
undisturbed
and
lady
selina
alone
summoned
to
join
the
aged
female
senators
of
grey
abbey
footnote
mumchance
silent
and
idle
selina
said
her
ladyship
as
soon
as
her
daughter
was
seated
on
the
sofa
opposite
to
her
mother
easy
chair
while
griffiths
having
shut
the
door
had
according
to
custom
sat
herself
down
on
her
own
chair
on
the
further
side
of
the
little
table
that
always
stood
at
the
countess
right
hand
selina
what
do
you
think
your
father
tells
me
lady
selina
could
think
and
declined
guessing
for
as
she
remarked
guessing
was
a
loss
of
time
and
she
never
guessed
right
adolphus
is
coming
home
on
tuesday
adolphus
why
it
not
a
month
since
he
was
here
and
he
not
coming
only
for
a
visit
he
coming
to
stay
here
from
what
your
father
says
i
suppose
he
stay
here
the
greater
part
of
the
summer
what
stay
at
grey
abbey
all
may
and
june
said
lady
selina
evidently
discrediting
so
unlikely
a
story
and
thinking
it
all
but
impossible
that
her
brother
should
immure
himself
at
grey
abbey
during
the
london
season
it
true
my
lady
said
griffiths
oracularly
as
if
her
word
were
necessary
to
place
the
countess
statement
beyond
doubt
yes
continued
lady
cashel
and
he
has
given
up
all
his
establishment
in
london
his
horses
and
clubs
and
the
opera
and
all
that
he
go
into
parliament
i
dare
say
now
for
the
county
at
any
rate
he
coming
to
live
at
home
here
for
the
summer
and
has
he
sold
all
his
horses
asked
lady
selina
if
he
not
done
it
he
doing
it
said
the
countess
i
declare
i
delighted
with
him
it
shows
such
proper
feeling
i
always
knew
he
would
i
was
sure
that
when
the
time
came
for
doing
it
adolphus
would
not
forget
what
was
due
to
himself
and
to
his
family
if
what
you
say
is
true
mamma
he
going
to
be
married
that
just
what
i
was
thinking
my
lady
said
griffiths
when
her
ladyship
first
told
me
all
about
it
how
his
lordship
was
coming
down
to
live
regular
and
decorous
among
his
own
people
and
that
he
was
turning
his
back
upon
his
pleasures
and
iniquities
thinks
i
to
myself
there
be
wedding
favours
coming
soon
to
grey
abbey
if
it
is
so
selina
your
father
did
say
anything
to
me
about
it
said
the
countess
somewhat
additionally
flustered
by
the
importance
of
the
last
suggestion
and
if
he
even
guessed
such
a
thing
i
sure
he
have
mentioned
it
it
might
be
quite
fixed
you
know
mamma
but
if
adolphus
is
doing
as
you
say
you
may
be
sure
he
either
engaged
or
thinking
of
becoming
so
well
my
dear
i
sure
i
wish
it
may
be
so
only
i
own
i
like
to
know
because
it
makes
a
difference
as
to
the
people
he
like
to
meet
you
know
i
sure
nothing
would
delight
me
so
much
as
to
receive
adolphus
wife
of
course
she
always
be
welcome
to
lie
in
here
indeed
it
be
the
fittest
place
but
we
should
be
dreadfully
put
about
eh
griffiths
why
we
should
my
lady
but
to
my
mind
this
would
be
the
only
most
proper
place
for
my
lord
heir
to
be
born
in
if
the
mother
and
child
could
have
the
best
of
minding
here
where
could
they
of
course
griffiths
and
we
would
mind
the
trouble
on
such
an
occasion
i
think
the
south
room
would
be
the
best
because
of
the
being
such
a
good
size
and
neither
of
the
fireplaces
smoking
you
know
well
i
do
doubt
but
it
would
my
lady
only
the
blue
room
is
nearer
to
your
ladyship
here
and
in
course
your
ladyship
would
choose
to
be
in
and
out
and
visions
of
caudle
cups
cradles
and
monthly
nurses
floated
over
lady
cashel
brain
and
gave
her
a
kind
of
dreamy
feel
that
the
world
was
going
to
begin
again
with
her
but
mamma
is
adolphus
really
to
be
here
on
tuesday
said
lady
selina
recalling
the
two
old
women
from
their
attendance
on
the
unborn
to
the
necessities
of
the
present
generation
indeed
he
is
my
dear
and
that
what
i
sent
for
you
for
your
papa
wishes
to
have
a
good
deal
of
company
here
to
meet
your
brother
and
indeed
it
only
reasonable
for
of
course
this
place
would
be
very
dull
for
him
if
there
was
nobody
here
but
ourselves
and
he
always
used
to
see
so
many
people
but
the
worst
is
it
all
to
be
done
at
once
and
you
know
there
be
so
much
to
be
got
through
before
be
ready
for
a
house
full
of
company
things
to
be
got
from
dublin
and
the
people
to
be
asked
and
then
selina
and
her
ladyship
almost
wept
as
the
latter
came
to
her
great
final
difficulty
what
are
we
to
do
about
a
cook
richards
never
do
griffiths
says
she
wo
even
do
for
ourselves
as
it
is
indeed
she
wo
my
lady
it
was
only
impudence
in
her
coming
to
such
a
place
at
she
never
be
able
to
send
a
dinner
up
for
eighteen
or
twenty
what
are
we
to
do
griffiths
what
can
have
become
of
all
the
cooks
i
sure
there
used
to
be
cooks
enough
when
i
was
first
married
well
my
lady
i
think
they
must
be
all
gone
to
england
those
that
are
any
good
but
i
do
know
what
come
to
the
servants
altogether
as
your
ladyship
says
they
quite
altered
for
the
worse
since
we
were
young
but
mamma
said
lady
selina
you
not
going
to
ask
people
here
just
immediately
are
you
directly
my
dear
your
papa
wishes
it
done
at
once
we
to
have
a
this
day
week
that
be
thursday
and
we
get
as
many
of
the
people
as
we
can
to
stay
afterwards
and
we
get
the
to
come
on
wednesday
just
to
make
the
table
look
not
quite
so
bare
and
i
want
you
to
write
the
notes
at
once
there
be
a
great
many
things
to
be
got
from
dublin
too
it
very
soon
after
poor
harry
wyndham
death
to
be
receiving
company
said
lady
selina
solemnly
really
mamma
i
do
think
it
will
be
treating
fanny
well
to
be
asking
all
these
people
so
soon
the
or
the
fitzgeralds
are
all
very
well
just
our
own
near
neighbours
but
do
you
think
mamma
it
rather
too
soon
to
be
asking
a
of
strange
people
well
my
love
i
was
thinking
so
and
i
mentioned
it
to
your
father
but
he
said
that
poor
harry
had
been
dead
a
month
now
and
that
true
you
know
and
that
people
do
think
so
much
now
about
those
kind
of
things
as
they
used
to
and
that
true
too
i
believe
indeed
you
may
say
that
my
lady
interposed
griffiths
i
remember
when
bombazines
used
to
be
worn
three
full
months
for
an
uncle
or
cousin
and
now
they
hardly
ever
worn
at
all
for
the
like
except
in
cases
where
the
brother
or
sister
of
him
or
her
as
is
dead
may
be
stopping
in
the
house
and
then
only
for
a
month
and
they
were
always
worn
the
full
six
months
for
a
brother
or
sister
and
sometimes
the
twelve
months
round
your
aunt
lady
charlotte
my
lady
wore
hers
the
full
twelve
months
when
your
uncle
lord
frederick
was
shot
by
sir
patrick
and
now
they
very
seldom
never
i
may
say
wear
them
the
six
months
indeed
i
think
mourning
is
going
out
altogether
and
i
very
sorry
for
it
for
it
a
very
decent
proper
sort
of
thing
at
least
such
was
always
my
humble
opinion
my
lady
well
but
what
i
was
saying
is
continued
the
countess
that
what
would
be
thought
strange
a
few
years
ago
is
thought
at
all
so
now
and
though
i
sure
selina
i
would
like
to
do
anything
that
looked
unkind
to
fanny
i
really
do
see
how
we
can
help
it
as
your
father
makes
such
a
point
of
it
i
ca
say
i
think
it
right
mamma
for
i
do
but
if
you
and
papa
do
of
course
i
nothing
further
to
say
well
my
love
i
do
know
that
i
do
exactly
think
it
right
and
i
sure
it
not
my
wish
to
be
having
people
especially
when
i
know
where
on
earth
to
turn
for
a
cook
but
what
can
we
do
my
dear
adolphus
would
stay
the
third
night
here
i
sure
if
there
was
nobody
to
amuse
him
and
you
would
have
him
turned
out
of
the
house
would
you
have
him
turned
out
mamma
god
forbid
i
sooner
he
should
be
here
than
anywhere
for
here
he
must
be
out
of
harm
way
but
still
i
think
that
if
he
comes
to
a
house
of
mourning
he
might
for
a
short
time
submit
to
put
up
with
its
decent
tranquillity
selina
said
the
mother
pettishly
i
really
thought
you
help
me
when
i
so
much
to
trouble
and
vex
me
and
not
make
any
fresh
difficulties
how
can
i
help
it
if
your
father
says
the
people
are
to
come
i
ca
say
i
wo
let
them
in
i
hope
you
wo
make
fanny
think
i
doing
it
from
disrespect
to
her
i
sure
i
would
have
a
soul
here
for
a
twelvemonth
on
my
own
account
i
sure
miss
wyndham
wo
think
any
such
thing
my
lady
said
griffiths
will
she
lady
selina
indeed
i
do
think
she
matter
it
one
pin
indeed
selina
i
do
think
she
will
said
the
countess
and
then
she
half
whispered
to
her
daughter
poor
fanny
it
not
about
her
brother
she
grieving
it
that
horrid
man
ballindine
she
sent
him
away
and
now
she
wants
to
have
him
back
i
really
think
a
little
company
will
be
the
best
thing
to
bring
her
to
herself
again
there
was
a
little
degree
of
humbug
in
this
whisper
for
her
ladyship
meant
her
daughter
to
understand
that
she
would
speak
aloud
about
before
griffiths
and
yet
she
had
spent
many
a
half
hour
talking
to
her
factotum
on
that
very
subject
indeed
what
subject
was
there
of
any
interest
to
lady
cashel
on
which
she
did
not
talk
to
griffiths
well
mamma
said
lady
selina
dutifully
i
not
say
another
word
about
it
only
let
me
know
what
you
want
me
to
do
and
i
do
it
who
is
it
you
mean
to
ask
why
first
of
all
there
the
fitzgeralds
your
father
thinks
that
lord
and
lady
george
would
come
for
a
week
or
so
and
you
know
the
girls
have
been
long
talking
of
coming
to
grey
abbey
these
two
years
i
believe
and
more
the
girls
will
come
i
dare
say
mamma
though
i
do
exactly
think
they
the
sort
of
people
who
will
amuse
adolphus
but
i
do
think
lord
george
or
lady
george
will
sleep
away
from
home
we
can
ask
them
however
mountains
is
only
five
miles
from
here
and
i
sure
go
back
after
dinner
well
my
dear
if
they
will
they
must
and
i
ca
help
it
only
i
must
say
it
be
very
of
them
i
sure
it
a
long
time
since
they
were
asked
to
stay
here
as
you
say
mamma
at
any
rate
we
can
ask
them
and
who
comes
next
why
your
father
has
put
down
the
swinburn
people
next
though
i
sure
i
do
know
how
they
are
to
come
so
far
why
mamma
the
colonel
is
a
martyr
to
the
gout
yes
my
lady
said
griffiths
and
ellison
is
worse
again
with
rheumatics
there
would
be
nothing
to
do
the
whole
time
but
nurse
the
two
of
them
never
mind
griffiths
you
not
have
to
nurse
them
so
you
be
so
me
my
lady
i
sure
i
begs
pardon
but
i
did
mean
nothing
besides
ellison
was
always
a
very
nice
lady
to
me
and
i
sure
i
be
happy
to
nurse
her
if
she
wanted
it
only
that
as
in
duty
bound
i
your
ladyship
to
look
to
first
and
so
could
spare
time
very
well
for
nursing
any
one
of
course
you
could
griffiths
but
selina
at
any
rate
you
must
ask
the
ellisons
your
papa
thinks
a
great
deal
about
the
colonel
he
has
so
much
influence
in
the
county
and
adolphus
will
very
likely
stand
now
your
papa
and
the
colonel
were
members
together
for
the
county
more
than
forty
years
since
well
mamma
i
write
ellison
shall
i
say
for
a
week
or
ten
days
say
for
ten
days
or
a
fortnight
and
then
perhaps
they
stay
a
week
then
there
the
bishop
of
maryborough
and
moore
i
sure
adolphus
will
be
glad
to
meet
the
bishop
for
it
was
he
that
christened
him
very
well
mamma
i
write
to
moore
i
suppose
the
bishop
is
in
dublin
at
present
yes
my
dear
i
believe
so
there
ca
be
anything
to
prevent
their
coming
only
that
he
the
managing
man
on
the
education
board
and
giving
up
his
time
very
much
to
that
at
present
i
dare
say
he
come
but
he
wo
stay
long
well
selina
if
he
wo
i
ca
help
it
and
i
sure
now
i
think
about
the
cook
i
do
see
how
we
to
expect
anybody
to
stay
what
am
i
to
do
griffiths
about
that
horrid
woman
i
tell
you
what
i
was
thinking
my
lady
only
i
do
know
whether
your
ladyship
would
like
it
either
and
if
you
did
you
could
easily
get
rid
of
him
when
all
these
people
are
gone
get
rid
of
who
i
was
going
to
say
my
lady
if
your
ladyship
would
consent
to
have
a
man
cook
for
a
time
just
to
try
then
i
never
will
griffiths
there
be
no
peace
in
the
house
with
him
well
your
ladyship
knows
best
in
course
only
if
you
thought
well
of
trying
it
of
course
you
need
keep
the
man
and
i
know
murray
in
dublin
that
was
cook
so
many
years
to
old
lord
galway
i
know
he
to
be
heard
of
at
the
hotel
in
grafton
street
i
ca
bear
the
thoughts
of
a
man
cook
griffiths
i
sooner
have
three
women
cooks
and
i
sure
one
enough
to
plague
anybody
but
none
worse
my
lady
said
griffiths
you
need
tell
me
that
i
wonder
selina
if
i
were
to
write
to
my
sister
whether
she
could
send
me
over
anything
that
would
answer
what
from
london
my
lady
answered
griffiths
you
find
a
london
woman
cook
sent
over
in
that
way
twice
worse
than
any
man
she
be
all
airs
and
graces
if
your
ladyship
thought
well
of
thinking
about
murray
richards
would
do
very
well
under
him
she
a
decent
poor
creature
poor
woman
only
she
certainly
is
not
a
cook
that
suit
for
such
a
house
as
this
and
it
was
only
impudence
her
thinking
to
attempt
it
but
mamma
said
lady
selina
do
let
me
know
to
whom
i
am
to
write
and
then
you
and
griffiths
can
settle
about
the
cook
afterwards
the
time
is
so
very
short
that
i
ought
not
to
lose
a
post
the
poor
countess
threw
herself
back
in
her
easy
chair
the
picture
of
despair
oh
how
much
preferable
were
rolls
of
worsted
and
yards
of
netting
to
the
toils
and
turmoil
of
preparing
for
and
entertaining
company
she
was
already
nearly
overcome
by
the
former
she
did
dare
to
look
forward
to
the
miseries
of
the
latter
she
already
began
to
feel
the
ill
effects
of
her
son
reformation
and
to
wish
that
it
had
been
postponed
just
for
a
month
or
two
till
she
was
a
little
more
settled
well
mamma
said
lady
selina
as
undisturbed
and
calm
as
ever
and
as
resolved
to
do
her
duty
without
flinching
shall
we
go
on
the
countess
groaned
and
sighed
there
the
list
there
selina
which
your
father
put
down
in
pencil
you
know
the
people
as
well
as
i
do
just
ask
them
all
but
mamma
i
not
to
ask
them
all
to
stay
here
i
suppose
some
are
only
to
come
to
dinner
the
and
the
parchments
ask
the
for
wednesday
and
thursday
the
girls
might
as
well
stay
and
sleep
here
but
what
the
good
of
writing
to
them
ca
you
drive
over
to
the
parsonage
and
settle
it
all
there
you
do
nothing
but
make
difficulties
selina
and
my
racking
lady
selina
sate
silent
for
a
short
time
conning
the
list
and
endeavouring
to
see
her
way
through
the
labyrinth
of
difficulties
which
was
before
her
without
further
trouble
to
her
mother
while
the
countess
leaned
back
with
her
eyes
closed
and
her
hands
placed
on
the
arms
of
her
chair
as
though
she
were
endeavouring
to
get
some
repose
after
the
labour
she
had
gone
through
her
daughter
however
again
disturbed
her
mamma
she
said
trying
by
the
solemnity
of
her
tone
to
impress
her
mother
with
the
absolute
necessity
she
was
under
of
again
appealing
to
her
upon
the
subject
what
we
to
do
about
young
men
about
young
men
my
dear
yes
mamma
there
be
a
of
young
ladies
there
the
fitzgeralds
and
lady
louisa
pratt
and
miss
ellison
and
the
three
and
not
a
single
young
man
except
mr
curate
well
my
dear
i
sure
hill
a
very
nice
young
man
so
he
is
mamma
a
very
good
young
man
but
he
wo
do
to
amuse
such
a
quantity
of
girls
if
there
were
only
one
or
two
he
do
very
well
besides
i
sure
adolphus
wo
like
it
why
wo
he
talk
to
the
young
ladies
i
sure
he
was
always
fond
of
ladies
society
i
tell
you
mamma
it
wo
do
there
be
the
bishop
and
two
other
clergymen
and
old
colonel
ellison
who
has
always
got
the
gout
and
lord
george
if
he
comes
and
i
sure
he
wo
if
you
want
to
make
a
pleasant
party
for
adolphus
you
must
get
some
young
men
besides
you
ca
ask
all
those
girls
and
have
nobody
to
dance
with
them
or
talk
to
them
i
sure
my
dear
i
do
know
what
you
to
do
i
do
know
any
young
men
except
hill
and
there
that
young
grundy
who
lives
in
dublin
i
promised
his
aunt
to
be
civil
to
him
ca
you
ask
him
down
he
was
here
before
mamma
and
i
do
think
he
liked
it
i
sure
we
did
he
did
speak
a
word
the
whole
day
he
was
here
he
not
at
all
the
person
to
suit
adolphus
then
my
dear
you
go
to
your
papa
and
ask
him
it
quite
clear
i
ca
make
young
men
i
remember
years
ago
there
always
used
to
be
too
many
of
them
and
i
do
know
where
they
all
gone
to
at
any
rate
when
they
do
come
there
be
nothing
for
them
to
eat
and
lady
cashel
again
fell
back
upon
her
deficiencies
in
the
kitchen
establishment
lady
selina
saw
that
nothing
more
could
be
obtained
from
her
mother
no
further
intelligence
as
regarded
the
embryo
party
the
whole
burden
was
to
lie
on
her
shoulders
and
very
heavy
she
felt
it
as
far
as
concerned
herself
she
had
no
particular
wish
for
one
kind
of
guest
more
than
another
it
was
not
for
herself
that
she
wanted
young
men
she
knew
that
at
any
rate
there
were
none
within
reach
whom
she
could
condescend
to
notice
save
as
her
father
guests
there
could
be
no
one
there
whose
presence
could
be
to
her
of
any
interest
the
gouty
colonel
and
the
worthy
bishop
would
be
as
agreeable
to
her
as
any
other
men
that
would
now
be
likely
to
visit
grey
abbey
but
lady
selina
felt
a
real
desire
that
others
in
the
house
might
be
happy
while
there
she
was
no
flirt
herself
nor
had
she
ever
been
it
was
not
in
her
nature
to
be
so
but
though
she
herself
might
be
contented
to
twaddle
with
old
men
she
knew
that
other
girls
would
not
yet
it
was
not
that
she
herself
had
no
inward
wish
for
that
admiration
which
is
desired
by
nearly
every
woman
or
that
she
thought
a
married
state
was
an
unenviable
one
no
she
could
have
loved
and
loved
truly
and
could
have
devoted
herself
most
scrupulously
to
the
duties
of
a
wife
but
she
had
vainly
and
foolishly
built
up
for
herself
a
pedestal
and
there
she
had
placed
herself
nor
would
she
come
down
to
stand
on
common
earth
though
apollo
had
enticed
her
unless
he
came
with
the
coronet
of
a
peer
upon
his
brow
she
left
her
mother
boudoir
went
down
into
the
and
there
she
wrote
her
notes
of
invitation
and
her
orders
to
the
tradesmen
and
then
she
went
to
her
father
and
consulted
him
on
the
difficult
subject
of
young
men
she
suggested
the
newbridge
barracks
where
the
dragoons
were
and
the
curragh
where
perhaps
some
stray
denizen
of
pleasure
might
be
found
neither
too
bad
for
grey
abbey
nor
too
good
to
be
acceptable
to
lord
kilcullen
and
at
last
it
was
decided
that
a
certain
captain
cokely
and
mat
tierney
should
be
asked
they
were
both
acquaintances
of
adolphus
and
though
mat
was
not
a
young
man
he
was
not
very
old
and
was
usually
very
gay
so
that
matter
was
settled
and
the
invitations
were
sent
off
the
countess
overcame
her
difficulty
by
consenting
that
murray
the
man
cook
should
be
hired
for
a
given
time
with
the
distinct
understanding
that
he
was
to
take
himself
off
with
the
rest
of
the
guests
and
so
great
was
her
ladyship
sense
of
the
importance
of
the
negotiation
that
she
absolutely
despatched
griffiths
to
dublin
to
arrange
it
though
thereby
she
was
left
two
whole
days
in
solitary
misery
at
grey
abbey
and
had
to
go
to
bed
and
get
up
she
really
hardly
knew
how
with
such
assistance
as
lady
selina
maid
could
give
her
when
these
things
were
all
arranged
selina
told
her
cousin
that
adolphus
was
coming
home
and
that
a
house
full
of
company
had
been
asked
to
meet
him
she
was
afraid
that
fanny
would
be
annoyed
and
offended
at
being
forced
to
go
into
company
so
soon
after
her
death
but
such
was
not
the
case
she
felt
herself
that
her
poor
brother
was
not
the
cause
of
the
grief
that
was
near
her
heart
and
she
would
not
pretend
what
she
did
really
feel
you
were
quite
right
selina
she
said
smiling
about
the
things
you
said
yesterday
i
should
want
from
dublin
now
i
shall
want
them
and
as
i
would
accept
of
your
offer
i
must
take
the
trouble
of
writing
myself
if
you
like
it
fanny
i
write
for
you
said
selina
oh
no
i
not
quite
so
idle
as
that
and
she
also
began
her
preparations
for
the
expected
festivities
little
did
either
of
them
think
that
she
fanny
wyndham
was
the
sole
cause
of
all
the
trouble
which
the
household
and
neighbourhood
were
to
undergo
the
fatigue
of
the
countess
griffiths
journey
the
arrival
of
the
dread
man
cook
richards
indignation
at
being
made
subordinate
to
such
authority
the
bishop
desertion
of
the
education
board
the
colonel
dangerous
and
precipitate
consumption
of
colchicum
the
quarrel
between
lord
and
lady
george
as
to
staying
or
not
staying
the
new
dresses
of
the
miss
which
their
worthy
father
could
so
ill
afford
and
above
all
the
confusion
misery
rage
and
astonishment
which
attended
lord
kilcullen
unexpected
retreat
from
london
in
the
middle
of
the
summer
and
all
in
vain
how
proud
and
satisfied
lord
ballindine
might
have
been
had
he
been
able
to
see
all
this
and
could
he
have
known
how
futile
was
every
effort
lord
cashel
could
make
to
drive
from
fanny
wyndham
heart
the
love
she
felt
for
him
the
invitations
however
were
generally
speaking
accepted
the
bishop
and
his
wife
would
be
most
happy
the
colonel
would
come
if
the
gout
would
possibly
allow
lady
george
wrote
a
note
to
say
they
would
be
very
happy
to
stay
a
few
days
and
lord
george
wrote
another
soon
after
to
say
he
was
sorry
but
that
they
must
return
the
same
evening
the
would
be
delighted
mat
tierney
would
be
very
proud
captain
cokely
would
do
himself
the
honour
and
last
but
not
least
murray
would
preside
below
stairs
for
a
serious
consideration
what
a
pity
so
much
trouble
should
have
been
taken
they
might
all
have
stayed
at
home
for
fanny
wyndham
will
never
become
lady
kilcullen
xxx
lord
kilcullen
obeys
his
father
on
the
appointed
day
or
rather
on
the
night
of
the
appointed
day
lord
kilcullen
reached
grey
abbey
for
it
was
about
eleven
when
his
rattled
up
to
the
door
he
had
been
expected
to
dinner
at
seven
and
the
first
attempts
of
murray
in
the
kitchens
of
grey
abbey
had
been
kept
waiting
for
him
till
eight
but
in
vain
at
that
hour
the
earl
black
with
ordered
dinner
and
remarked
that
he
considered
it
criminal
in
any
man
to
make
an
appointment
who
was
not
sufficiently
attached
to
veracity
to
keep
it
the
evening
was
passed
in
moody
silence
the
countess
was
disappointed
for
she
always
contrived
to
persuade
herself
that
she
was
very
anxious
to
see
her
son
lady
selina
was
really
vexed
and
began
to
have
her
doubts
as
to
her
brother
coming
at
all
what
was
to
be
done
if
it
turned
out
that
all
the
company
had
been
invited
for
nothing
as
to
fanny
though
very
indifferent
to
the
subject
of
her
cousin
coming
she
was
not
at
all
in
a
state
of
mind
to
dissipate
the
sullenness
which
prevailed
the
ladies
went
to
bed
early
the
countess
grumbling
at
her
lot
in
not
being
allowed
to
see
her
son
and
her
daughter
and
niece
marching
off
with
their
respective
candlesticks
in
solemn
silence
the
earl
retired
to
his
soon
afterwards
but
he
had
not
yet
sat
down
when
the
quick
rattle
of
the
wheels
was
heard
upon
the
gravel
before
the
house
lord
cashel
walked
out
into
the
hall
prepared
to
meet
his
son
in
a
befitting
manner
that
is
with
a
dignified
austerity
that
could
not
fail
to
convey
a
rebuke
even
to
his
hardened
heart
but
he
was
balked
in
his
purpose
for
he
found
that
lord
kilcullen
was
not
alone
mat
tierney
had
come
down
with
him
kilcullen
had
met
his
friend
in
dublin
and
on
learning
that
he
also
was
bound
for
grey
abbey
on
the
day
but
one
following
had
persuaded
him
to
accelerate
his
visit
had
waited
for
him
and
brought
him
down
in
his
own
carriage
the
truth
was
that
lord
kilcullen
had
thought
that
the
shades
of
grey
abbey
would
be
too
much
for
him
without
some
genial
spirit
to
enlighten
them
he
was
delighted
to
find
that
mat
tierney
was
to
be
there
and
was
rejoiced
to
be
able
to
convey
him
with
him
as
a
sort
of
protection
from
his
father
eloquence
for
the
first
two
days
of
the
visit
lord
kilcullen
your
mother
and
i
began
the
father
intent
on
at
once
commenting
on
the
iniquity
of
the
late
arrival
when
he
saw
the
figure
of
a
very
stout
gentleman
amply
wrapped
up
in
travelling
habiliments
follow
his
son
into
the
inner
hall
tierney
my
lord
said
the
son
was
good
enough
to
come
down
with
me
i
found
that
he
intended
to
be
here
and
i
told
him
you
and
my
mother
would
be
delighted
to
see
him
instead
the
earl
shook
tierney
hand
and
told
him
how
very
welcome
he
was
at
all
times
and
especially
at
present
unexpected
pleasures
were
always
the
most
agreeable
and
then
the
earl
bustled
about
and
ordered
supper
and
wine
and
fussed
about
the
and
performed
the
necessary
rites
of
hospitality
and
then
went
to
bed
without
having
made
one
solemn
speech
to
his
son
so
far
lord
kilcullen
had
been
successful
in
his
manoeuvre
and
he
trusted
that
by
making
judicious
use
of
mat
tierney
he
might
be
able
to
stave
off
the
evil
hour
for
at
any
rate
a
couple
of
days
but
he
was
mistaken
lord
cashel
was
now
too
much
in
earnest
to
be
put
off
his
purpose
he
had
been
made
too
painfully
aware
that
his
son
position
was
desperate
and
that
he
must
at
once
be
saved
by
a
desperate
effort
or
given
over
to
utter
ruin
and
to
tell
the
truth
so
heavy
were
the
new
debts
of
which
he
heard
from
day
to
day
so
insurmountable
seemed
the
difficulties
that
he
all
but
repented
that
he
had
not
left
him
to
his
fate
the
attempt
however
must
again
be
made
he
was
there
in
the
house
and
could
not
be
turned
out
but
lord
cashel
determined
that
at
any
rate
no
time
should
be
lost
the
two
new
arrivals
made
their
appearance
the
next
morning
greatly
to
lady
cashel
delight
she
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
her
apology
and
delighted
to
find
that
at
any
rate
one
of
her
expected
guests
would
not
fail
her
in
her
need
the
breakfast
went
over
pleasantly
enough
and
kilcullen
was
asking
mat
to
accompany
him
into
the
stables
to
see
what
novelties
they
should
find
there
when
lord
cashel
spoiled
the
arrangement
by
saying
could
you
spare
me
in
the
bookroom
first
kilcullen
this
request
of
course
could
not
be
refused
and
the
father
and
son
walked
off
leaving
mat
tierney
to
the
charity
of
the
ladies
there
was
much
less
of
flippant
overbearing
impudence
now
about
lord
kilcullen
much
less
of
arrogance
and
insult
from
the
son
towards
the
father
than
there
had
been
in
the
previous
interview
which
has
been
recorded
he
seemed
to
be
somewhat
in
dread
to
be
cowed
and
ill
at
ease
he
tried
however
to
assume
his
usual
manner
and
followed
his
father
into
the
with
an
affected
air
of
indifference
which
very
ill
concealed
his
real
feelings
kilcullen
began
the
earl
i
was
very
sorry
to
see
tierney
with
you
last
night
it
would
have
been
much
better
that
we
should
have
been
alone
together
at
any
rate
for
one
morning
i
suppose
you
are
aware
that
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
talked
over
between
us
i
suppose
there
is
said
the
son
but
i
could
well
help
bringing
the
man
when
he
told
me
he
was
coming
here
he
did
ask
you
to
bring
him
i
suppose
but
we
will
not
talk
about
that
will
you
do
me
the
favour
to
inform
me
what
your
present
plans
are
my
present
plans
my
lord
indeed
i
no
plans
it
a
long
time
since
i
had
a
plan
of
my
own
i
am
however
prepared
to
acquiesce
entirely
in
any
which
you
may
propose
i
have
come
quite
prepared
to
throw
at
miss
wyndham
feet
myself
and
my
fortune
and
do
you
expect
her
to
accept
you
you
said
she
would
my
lord
so
i
have
taken
that
for
granted
i
at
any
rate
will
ask
her
if
she
refuses
me
your
lordship
will
perhaps
be
able
to
persuade
her
to
a
measure
so
evidently
beneficial
to
all
parties
the
persuading
must
be
with
yourself
but
if
you
suppose
you
can
carry
her
with
a
high
hand
without
giving
yourself
the
trouble
to
try
to
please
her
you
are
very
much
mistaken
if
you
think
she
accept
you
merely
because
you
ask
her
you
might
save
yourself
the
trouble
and
as
well
return
to
london
at
once
just
as
you
please
my
lord
but
i
thought
i
came
in
obedience
to
your
express
wishes
so
you
did
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
your
manner
in
coming
is
very
different
from
what
i
would
wish
it
to
be
your
did
you
want
me
to
crawl
here
on
my
hands
and
knees
i
wanted
you
to
come
kilcullen
with
some
sense
of
what
you
owe
to
those
who
are
endeavouring
to
rescue
you
from
ruin
with
some
feeling
of
at
any
rate
sorrow
for
the
mad
extravagance
of
your
past
career
instead
of
that
you
come
gay
reckless
and
unconcerned
as
ever
you
pick
up
the
first
jovial
companion
you
meet
and
with
him
disturb
the
house
at
a
most
unseasonable
hour
you
are
totally
regardless
of
the
appointments
you
make
and
plainly
show
that
as
you
come
here
solely
for
your
own
pleasure
you
consider
it
needless
to
consult
my
wishes
or
my
comfort
are
you
aware
that
you
kept
your
mother
and
myself
two
hours
waiting
for
dinner
yesterday
the
pathos
with
which
lord
cashel
terminated
his
speech
and
it
was
one
the
thrilling
effect
of
which
he
intended
to
be
overwhelming
almost
restored
lord
kilcullen
to
his
accustomed
effrontery
my
lord
he
said
i
did
not
consider
myself
of
sufficient
importance
to
have
delayed
your
dinner
ten
minutes
i
have
always
endeavoured
kilcullen
to
show
the
same
respect
to
you
in
my
house
which
my
father
showed
to
me
in
his
but
you
do
not
allow
me
the
opportunity
but
let
that
pass
we
have
more
important
things
to
speak
of
when
last
we
were
here
together
why
did
you
not
tell
me
the
whole
truth
what
truth
my
lord
about
your
debts
kilcullen
why
did
you
conceal
from
me
their
full
amount
why
at
any
rate
did
you
take
pains
to
make
me
think
them
so
much
less
than
they
really
are
conceal
my
lord
that
is
hardly
fair
considering
that
i
told
you
expressly
i
could
not
give
you
any
idea
what
was
the
amount
i
owed
i
concealed
nothing
if
you
deceived
yourself
the
fault
was
not
mine
you
could
not
but
have
known
that
the
claims
against
you
were
much
larger
than
i
supposed
them
to
be
double
i
suppose
good
heaven
why
in
ten
years
more
at
this
rate
you
would
more
than
consume
the
fee
simple
of
the
whole
property
what
can
i
say
to
you
kilcullen
to
make
you
look
on
your
own
conduct
in
the
proper
light
i
think
you
have
said
enough
for
the
purpose
you
have
told
me
to
marry
and
i
have
consented
to
do
so
do
you
think
kilcullen
you
have
spent
the
last
eight
years
in
a
way
which
it
can
please
a
father
to
contemplate
do
you
think
i
can
look
back
on
your
conduct
with
satisfaction
or
content
and
yet
you
have
no
regret
to
express
for
the
past
no
promises
to
make
for
the
future
i
fear
it
is
all
in
vain
i
fear
that
what
i
am
doing
what
i
am
striving
to
do
is
now
all
in
vain
i
fear
it
is
hopeless
to
attempt
to
recall
you
from
the
horrid
reckless
wicked
mode
of
life
you
have
adopted
the
sombre
mantle
of
expostulatory
eloquence
had
now
descended
on
the
earl
and
he
continued
turning
full
upon
his
victim
and
raising
and
lowering
his
voice
with
monotonous
i
fear
it
is
to
no
good
purpose
that
i
am
subjecting
your
mother
and
myself
to
privation
restraint
and
inconvenience
that
i
am
straining
every
nerve
to
place
you
again
in
a
position
of
respectability
a
position
suitable
to
my
fortune
and
your
own
rank
i
am
endeavouring
to
retrieve
the
desperate
extravagance
the
i
must
say
though
i
do
not
wish
to
hurt
your
feelings
yet
i
must
say
disgraceful
ruin
of
your
past
career
and
how
do
you
help
me
what
regret
do
you
show
what
promises
of
amendment
do
you
afford
you
drive
up
to
my
at
midnight
with
your
boon
companion
you
disturb
the
whole
household
at
most
unseasonable
hours
and
subject
my
family
to
the
same
disreputable
irregularity
in
which
you
have
yourself
so
long
indulged
can
such
doings
kilcullen
give
me
any
hopes
for
the
future
can
my
lord
i
am
extremely
sorry
for
the
dinner
what
can
i
say
more
and
as
for
mat
tierney
he
is
your
own
guest
or
her
ladyship
not
mine
it
is
my
misfortune
to
have
come
in
the
same
carriage
with
him
but
that
is
the
extent
of
my
offence
well
kilcullen
if
you
think
your
conduct
has
always
been
such
as
it
ought
to
be
it
is
of
little
use
for
me
to
bring
up
arguments
to
the
contrary
i
do
think
so
my
lord
what
can
i
say
more
i
have
done
those
things
which
i
ought
not
to
have
done
were
i
to
confess
my
transgressions
for
the
hour
together
i
could
not
say
more
except
that
i
have
left
undone
the
things
which
i
ought
to
have
done
or
do
you
want
me
to
beat
my
breast
and
tear
my
hair
i
want
you
lord
kilcullen
to
show
some
sense
of
decency
some
filial
respect
well
my
lord
here
i
am
prepared
to
marry
a
wife
of
your
own
choosing
and
to
set
about
the
business
this
morning
if
you
please
i
thought
you
would
have
called
that
decent
filial
and
respectable
the
earl
could
hardly
gainsay
this
but
still
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
give
over
so
soon
the
unusual
pleasure
of
blowing
up
his
only
son
it
was
so
long
since
lord
kilcullen
had
been
regularly
in
his
power
and
it
might
never
occur
again
so
he
returned
from
consideration
of
the
future
to
a
further
retrospect
on
the
past
you
certainly
have
played
your
cards
most
foolishly
you
have
thrown
away
your
money
rather
i
should
say
my
money
in
a
manner
which
nothing
can
excuse
or
palliate
you
might
have
made
the
turf
a
source
of
gratifying
amusement
your
income
was
amply
sufficient
to
enable
you
to
do
so
but
you
have
possessed
so
little
so
little
judgment
so
little
discrimination
that
you
have
allowed
yourself
to
be
plundered
by
every
blackleg
and
robbed
by
every
everybody
in
short
who
chose
to
rob
you
the
same
thing
has
been
the
case
in
all
your
other
amusements
and
pursuits
well
my
lord
i
confess
it
all
is
that
enough
enough
kilcullen
said
the
earl
in
a
voice
of
horrified
astonishment
how
enough
how
can
anything
be
enough
after
such
a
course
so
wild
so
mad
so
ruinous
for
heaven
sake
my
lord
finish
the
list
of
my
iniquities
or
you
make
me
feel
that
i
am
utterly
unfit
to
become
my
husband
i
fear
you
are
indeed
i
fear
you
are
are
the
horses
disposed
of
yet
kilcullen
indeed
they
are
not
my
lord
nor
can
i
dispose
of
them
there
is
more
owing
for
them
than
they
are
worth
you
may
say
they
belong
to
the
trainer
now
is
the
establishment
in
curzon
street
broken
up
to
tell
the
truth
not
exactly
but
i
no
thoughts
of
returning
there
i
still
under
rent
for
the
house
the
was
continued
for
a
considerable
time
till
the
earl
had
literally
nothing
more
to
say
and
lord
kilcullen
was
so
irritated
that
he
told
his
father
he
would
not
stand
it
any
longer
then
they
went
into
money
affairs
and
the
earl
spoke
despondingly
about
ten
thousands
and
twenty
thousands
and
the
viscount
somewhat
flippantly
of
fifty
thousands
and
sixty
thousands
and
this
was
continued
till
the
earl
felt
that
his
son
was
too
deep
in
the
mire
to
be
pulled
out
and
the
son
thought
that
deep
as
he
was
there
it
would
be
better
to
remain
and
wallow
in
it
than
undergo
so
disagreeable
a
process
as
that
to
which
his
father
subjected
him
in
extricating
him
from
it
it
was
settled
however
that
jervis
lord
agent
should
receive
full
authority
to
deal
summarily
in
all
matters
respecting
the
horses
and
their
trainers
the
house
in
curzon
street
and
its
inhabitants
and
all
other
appendages
and
sources
of
expense
which
lord
kilcullen
had
left
behind
him
and
that
he
kilcullen
should
at
once
commence
his
siege
upon
his
cousin
fortune
and
on
this
point
the
son
bargained
that
as
it
would
be
essentially
necessary
that
his
spirits
should
be
light
and
easy
he
was
not
during
the
operation
to
be
subjected
to
any
of
his
father
conversations
for
this
he
stipulated
as
an
absolute
quâ
in
the
negotiation
and
the
clause
was
at
last
agreed
to
though
not
without
much
difficulty
both
father
and
son
seemed
to
think
that
the
offer
should
be
made
at
once
lord
cashel
really
feared
that
his
son
would
be
arrested
at
grey
abbey
and
he
was
determined
to
pay
nothing
further
for
him
unless
he
felt
secure
of
fanny
fortune
and
whatever
were
lord
hopes
and
fears
as
to
his
future
lot
he
was
determined
not
to
remain
long
in
suspense
as
far
as
his
projected
marriage
was
concerned
he
was
determined
to
do
his
best
to
accomplish
it
for
he
would
have
done
anything
to
get
the
command
of
ready
money
if
he
was
not
successful
at
any
rate
he
need
not
remain
in
the
purgatory
of
grey
abbey
the
queen
bench
would
be
preferable
to
that
he
was
not
however
very
doubtful
he
felt
but
little
confidence
in
the
constancy
of
any
affection
and
a
great
deal
in
his
own
powers
of
fascination
he
had
always
been
successful
in
his
appeals
to
ladies
hearts
and
did
not
doubt
of
being
so
now
when
the
object
of
his
adoration
must
as
he
thought
be
so
dreadfully
in
want
of
some
excitement
something
to
interest
her
any
fool
might
have
her
now
thought
he
and
she
have
any
violent
objection
to
being
lady
kilcullen
for
the
present
and
lady
cashel
in
due
time
he
felt
however
something
like
remorse
at
the
arrangement
to
which
he
was
a
party
it
was
not
that
he
was
about
to
make
a
beautiful
creature
his
own
cousin
miserable
for
life
by
uniting
her
to
a
spendthrift
a
and
a
gambler
such
was
the
natural
lot
of
women
in
the
higher
ranks
of
life
but
he
felt
that
he
was
robbing
her
of
her
money
he
would
have
thought
it
to
be
no
disgrace
to
carry
her
off
had
another
person
been
her
guardian
she
would
then
have
had
fair
play
and
it
would
be
the
guardian
fault
if
her
fortune
were
not
secure
but
she
had
no
friend
now
to
protect
her
it
was
her
guardian
himself
who
was
betraying
her
to
ruin
however
the
money
must
be
had
and
lord
kilcullen
was
not
long
in
quieting
his
conscience
tierney
said
kilcullen
meeting
his
friend
after
his
escape
from
the
you
are
not
troubled
with
a
father
now
i
believe
do
you
recollect
whether
you
ever
had
one
well
i
ca
say
i
remember
just
at
present
said
mat
but
i
believe
i
had
a
sort
of
one
once
i
a
more
dutiful
son
than
you
said
the
other
i
never
can
forget
mine
i
have
no
doubt
an
alligator
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
is
a
fearful
creature
a
shark
when
one
bathing
or
a
jungle
tiger
when
one
out
shooting
ought
i
sure
to
be
avoided
but
no
creature
yet
created
however
hungry
or
however
savage
can
equal
in
ferocity
a
governor
who
has
to
shell
out
his
cash
i
no
wish
for
a
with
any
monster
but
i
sooner
meet
a
starved
hyena
in
the
desert
than
be
shut
up
for
another
hour
with
my
lord
cashel
in
that
room
of
his
on
the
side
of
the
hall
if
you
hear
of
my
having
beat
a
retreat
from
grey
abbey
without
giving
you
or
any
one
else
warning
of
my
intention
you
will
know
that
i
have
lacked
courage
to
comply
with
a
second
summons
to
those
gloomy
realms
if
i
receive
another
invite
such
as
that
i
got
this
morning
i
am
off
lady
cashel
guests
came
on
the
day
appointed
the
carriages
were
driven
up
one
after
another
in
quick
succession
about
an
hour
before
and
as
her
ladyship
mind
became
easy
on
the
score
of
disappointments
it
was
somewhat
troubled
as
to
the
multitude
of
people
to
be
fed
and
entertained
murray
had
not
yet
forgiven
the
injury
inflicted
on
him
when
the
family
dinner
was
kept
waiting
for
lord
kilcullen
and
richards
was
still
pouting
at
her
own
degraded
position
the
countess
had
spent
the
morning
pretending
to
make
arrangements
which
were
in
fact
all
settled
by
griffiths
and
when
she
commenced
the
operation
of
dressing
herself
she
declared
she
was
so
utterly
exhausted
by
what
she
had
gone
through
during
the
last
week
as
to
be
entirely
unfit
to
entertain
her
company
poor
dear
lady
cashel
was
she
so
ignorant
of
her
own
nature
as
to
suppose
it
possible
that
she
should
ever
entertain
anybody
however
a
glass
of
wine
and
some
mysterious
drops
and
a
little
paint
a
good
deal
of
coaxing
the
sight
of
her
diamonds
and
of
a
large
turban
somewhat
revivified
her
and
she
was
in
her
in
due
time
supported
by
lady
selina
and
fanny
ready
to
receive
her
visitors
as
soon
as
they
should
descend
from
their
respective
rooms
lady
cashel
had
already
welcomed
lord
george
and
shaken
hands
with
the
bishop
and
was
now
deep
in
turnips
and
freeholders
with
the
gouty
colonel
who
had
hobbled
into
the
room
on
a
pair
of
crutches
and
was
accommodated
with
two
easy
chairs
in
a
corner
one
for
himself
and
the
other
for
his
feet
now
my
dear
lady
george
said
the
countess
you
must
not
think
of
returning
to
mountains
tonight
indeed
we
made
sure
of
you
and
lord
george
for
a
week
my
dear
lady
cashel
it
impossible
indeed
we
wished
it
of
all
things
and
tried
it
every
way
but
we
could
manage
it
lord
george
has
so
much
to
do
there
the
sessions
at
dunlavin
and
he
has
promised
to
meet
sir
glenmalure
aubrey
about
a
road
or
a
river
or
a
bridge
i
forget
which
it
is
and
they
must
attend
to
those
things
you
know
or
the
tenants
could
get
their
corn
to
market
but
you
do
know
how
sorry
we
are
and
such
a
charming
set
you
have
got
here
well
i
know
it
no
use
pressing
you
but
i
ca
tell
you
how
vexed
i
am
for
i
counted
on
you
above
all
and
adolphus
will
be
so
sorry
you
know
lord
kilcullen
come
home
lady
george
yes
i
was
very
glad
to
hear
we
were
to
meet
him
oh
yes
he
come
to
stay
here
some
time
i
believe
he
got
quite
fond
of
grey
abbey
lately
he
and
his
father
get
on
so
well
together
it
quite
a
delight
to
me
oh
it
must
be
i
sure
said
lady
george
and
the
countess
sidled
off
to
the
bishop
fat
wife
well
this
is
very
kind
of
you
and
the
bishop
to
come
at
so
short
a
notice
indeed
i
hardly
dared
expect
it
i
know
he
has
so
much
to
do
in
dublin
with
those
horrid
boards
and
things
he
is
busy
there
to
be
sure
lady
cashel
but
he
could
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
coming
to
grey
abbey
he
thinks
so
very
much
of
the
earl
indeed
he
contrive
to
be
able
to
come
here
when
he
could
think
of
going
anywhere
else
i
sure
lord
cashel
feels
how
kind
he
is
and
so
do
i
and
so
does
adolphus
lord
kilcullen
will
be
delighted
to
meet
you
and
the
bishop
the
bishop
wife
assured
the
countess
that
nothing
on
earth
at
the
present
moment
would
give
the
bishop
so
much
pleasure
as
meeting
lord
kilcullen
you
know
the
bishop
christened
him
do
you
said
lady
cashel
no
did
he
though
said
the
bishop
wife
how
very
interesting
is
it
and
adolphus
longs
to
meet
him
he
so
fond
of
everything
that
and
talented
adolphus
is
a
little
sarcastic
perhaps
i
do
mind
saying
so
to
you
but
that
only
to
inferior
sort
of
people
not
talented
you
know
some
people
are
stupid
and
adolphus
ca
bear
that
indeed
they
are
my
lady
i
was
dining
last
week
at
prijean
in
merrion
square
you
know
mrs
prijean
i
think
i
met
her
at
carton
four
years
ago
well
she
is
very
heavy
what
do
you
think
lady
cashel
she
adolphus
ca
bear
people
of
that
sort
but
he
be
delighted
with
the
bishop
it
so
delightful
his
having
christened
him
adolphus
means
to
live
a
good
deal
here
now
indeed
he
and
his
father
have
so
much
in
common
that
they
ca
get
on
very
well
apart
and
i
really
hope
he
and
the
bishop
see
a
good
deal
of
each
other
and
the
countess
left
the
bishop
wife
and
sat
herself
down
by
old
ellison
my
dear
ellison
i
am
so
delighted
to
see
you
once
again
at
grey
abbey
it
such
ages
since
you
were
here
indeed
it
is
lady
cashel
a
very
long
time
but
the
poor
colonel
suffers
so
much
it
rarely
he
fit
to
be
moved
and
indeed
i
not
much
better
myself
i
was
not
able
to
move
my
left
shoulder
from
a
week
before
till
a
few
days
since
you
do
say
so
rheumatism
i
suppose
oh
yes
all
rheumatism
no
one
knows
what
i
suffer
and
what
do
you
use
for
it
oh
there
nothing
any
use
i
know
the
very
nature
of
rheumatism
now
i
had
it
so
long
and
it
minds
nothing
at
all
there
no
preventing
it
and
no
curing
it
it
like
a
bad
husband
lady
cashel
the
best
way
is
to
put
up
with
it
and
how
is
the
dear
colonel
mrs
ellison
why
he
was
just
able
to
come
here
and
that
was
all
but
he
was
dying
to
see
lord
cashel
he
thinks
the
ministers
be
shaken
about
this
business
of
and
if
so
that
there
be
a
general
election
and
then
what
they
do
about
the
county
i
sure
lord
cashel
wanted
to
see
the
colonel
on
that
very
subject
so
does
adolphus
lord
kilcullen
you
know
i
never
meddle
with
those
things
but
i
really
think
adolphus
is
thinking
of
going
into
parliament
you
know
he
living
here
at
present
his
father
views
and
his
own
are
so
exactly
the
same
on
all
those
sort
of
things
that
it
quite
delightful
he
taking
a
deal
of
interest
about
the
county
lately
is
adolphus
and
about
grey
abbey
too
he
just
the
same
his
father
used
to
be
and
that
kind
of
thing
is
so
pleasant
is
it
mrs
ellison
mrs
ellison
said
it
was
and
at
the
same
moment
groaned
for
her
shoulder
gave
her
a
twinge
the
subject
of
these
eulogiums
in
the
meantime
did
not
make
his
appearance
till
immediately
before
dinner
was
announced
and
certainly
did
not
evince
very
strongly
the
delight
which
his
mother
had
assured
her
friends
he
would
feel
at
meeting
them
for
he
paid
but
very
little
attention
to
any
one
but
mat
tierney
and
his
cousin
fanny
he
shook
hands
with
all
the
old
gentlemen
bowed
to
all
the
old
ladies
and
nodded
at
the
young
ones
but
if
he
really
felt
that
strong
desire
which
his
mother
had
imputed
to
him
of
opening
his
heart
to
the
bishop
and
the
colonel
respecting
things
temporal
and
spiritual
he
certainly
very
successfully
suppressed
his
anxiety
he
had
during
the
last
two
or
three
days
applied
himself
to
the
task
of
ingratiating
himself
with
fanny
he
well
knew
how
to
suit
himself
to
different
characters
and
to
make
himself
agreeable
when
he
pleased
and
fanny
though
she
had
never
much
admired
her
dissipated
cousin
certainly
found
his
conversation
a
relief
after
the
usual
oppressive
tedium
of
grey
abbey
society
he
had
not
begun
by
making
love
to
her
or
expressing
admiration
or
by
doing
or
saying
anything
which
could
at
all
lead
her
to
suspect
his
purpose
or
put
her
on
her
guard
he
had
certainly
been
much
more
attentive
to
her
much
more
intimate
with
her
than
he
usually
had
been
in
his
flying
visits
to
grey
abbey
but
then
he
was
now
making
his
first
appearance
as
a
reformed
rake
and
besides
he
was
her
first
cousin
and
she
therefore
felt
no
inclination
to
repel
his
advances
he
was
obliged
in
performance
of
a
domestic
duty
to
walk
out
to
dinner
with
one
of
lady
george
daughters
but
he
contrived
to
sit
next
to
fanny
and
much
to
his
father
satisfaction
talked
to
her
during
the
whole
ceremony
and
where
have
you
hidden
yourself
all
the
morning
fanny
said
he
that
nobody
has
seen
anything
of
you
since
breakfast
whither
have
taken
yourself
all
the
day
rather
that
you
had
not
a
moment
to
come
and
look
after
us
the
miss
have
been
expecting
you
to
ride
with
them
walk
with
them
talk
with
them
and
play
with
them
they
did
give
up
the
sticks
till
it
was
quite
dark
in
the
hope
of
you
and
mr
tierney
making
your
appearance
well
fanny
do
tell
my
mother
and
i
tell
you
the
truth
promise
now
oh
i
no
well
then
and
he
whispered
into
her
ear
i
was
running
away
from
the
miss
but
that
wo
do
at
all
do
you
know
they
were
asked
here
for
your
especial
edification
and
amusement
oh
i
know
they
were
so
were
the
bishop
and
the
colonel
and
lord
george
and
their
respective
wives
and
mr
hill
my
dear
mamma
asked
them
all
here
for
my
amusement
but
you
know
one
man
may
lead
a
horse
to
water
a
hundred
ca
make
him
drink
i
can
not
can
not
drink
of
the
miss
and
the
bishop
of
maryborough
for
shame
adolphus
you
ought
at
any
rate
to
do
something
to
amuse
them
amuse
them
my
dear
fanny
who
ever
heard
of
amusing
a
bishop
but
it
very
easy
to
find
fault
what
have
you
done
yourself
for
their
amusement
i
did
run
away
from
them
though
had
i
done
so
there
would
have
been
more
excuse
for
me
than
for
you
so
there
would
fanny
said
kilcullen
feeling
that
she
had
alluded
to
her
brother
death
and
i
very
very
sorry
all
these
people
are
here
to
bore
you
at
such
a
time
and
doubly
sorry
that
they
should
have
been
asked
on
my
account
they
mistake
me
greatly
here
they
know
that
i
thought
grey
abbey
dull
and
have
avoided
it
and
now
that
determined
to
get
over
the
feeling
because
i
think
it
right
to
do
so
they
make
it
ten
times
more
unbearable
than
ever
for
my
gratification
it
like
giving
a
child
physic
mixed
in
sugar
the
sugar
sure
to
be
the
nastiest
part
of
the
dose
indeed
i
have
no
dislike
to
grey
abbey
at
present
though
i
own
i
have
no
taste
for
the
sugar
in
which
my
kind
mother
has
tried
to
conceal
its
proper
flavour
well
make
the
best
of
it
they
all
be
gone
in
ten
days
ten
days
are
they
to
stay
ten
days
will
you
tell
me
fanny
what
was
the
object
in
asking
mat
tierney
to
meet
such
a
party
to
help
you
to
amuse
the
young
ladies
gracious
heavens
does
lady
cashel
really
expect
mat
tierney
to
play
with
the
miss
well
the
time
will
come
to
an
end
i
suppose
but
in
truth
i
more
sorry
for
you
than
for
any
one
it
was
very
their
getting
such
a
crowd
to
bore
you
at
such
a
time
and
lord
kilcullen
contrived
to
give
his
voice
a
tone
of
tender
solicitude
kilcullen
said
the
earl
across
the
table
you
do
hear
the
bishop
his
lordship
is
asking
you
to
drink
wine
with
him
i
shall
be
most
proud
of
the
honour
said
the
son
and
bobbed
his
head
at
the
bishop
across
the
table
fanny
was
on
the
point
of
saying
something
respecting
her
brother
to
lord
kilcullen
which
would
have
created
a
kind
of
confidence
between
them
but
the
bishop
glass
of
wine
broke
it
off
and
from
that
time
lord
kilcullen
was
forced
by
his
father
into
a
general
conversation
with
his
guests
in
the
evening
there
was
music
and
singing
the
miss
and
miss
fitzgeralds
and
mr
hill
performed
even
mat
tierney
condescended
to
amuse
the
company
by
singing
the
coronation
first
begging
the
bishop
to
excuse
the
peculiar
allusions
to
the
contained
in
one
of
the
verses
and
then
fanny
was
asked
to
sing
she
had
again
become
silent
dull
and
unhappy
was
brooding
over
her
miseries
and
disappointments
and
she
declined
lord
kilcullen
was
behind
her
chair
and
when
they
pressed
her
he
whispered
to
her
do
sing
for
them
fanny
it
a
shame
that
they
should
tease
you
at
such
a
time
i
wonder
how
my
mother
can
have
been
so
thoughtless
fanny
persisted
in
declining
to
sing
and
lord
kilcullen
again
sat
down
beside
her
do
trouble
yourself
about
them
fanny
said
he
they
just
fit
to
sing
to
each
other
it
very
good
work
for
them
i
should
think
it
very
good
work
as
you
call
it
for
myself
too
another
time
only
i
hardly
in
singing
humour
at
present
and
therefore
obliged
to
you
for
your
assistance
and
protection
your
most
devoted
knight
as
long
as
this
fearful
invasion
lasts
your
amadis
de
gaul
your
bertrand
du
guesclin
and
no
paladin
of
old
ever
attempted
to
defend
a
damsel
from
more
formidable
foes

gaul
was
the
title
hero
of
a
century
romantic
novel
probably
first
written
in
spanish
which
was
popular
throughout
europe
bertrand
du
guesclin
was
a
historical
figure
a
fourteenth
century
french
soldier
and
marshall
of
france
indeed
adolphus
i
do
think
them
so
formidable
many
of
them
are
my
own
friends
is
mrs
ellison
your
own
friend
or
mrs
moore
not
exactly
those
two
in
particular
who
then
is
it
miss
judith
or
is
the
reverend
mr
hill
one
of
those
to
whom
you
give
that
sweetest
of
all
names
yes
to
both
of
them
it
was
only
this
morning
i
had
a
long
what
with
mr
hill
no
not
with
mr
hill
though
it
would
be
the
first
even
with
him
but
with
judith
i
lent
her
a
pattern
for
worsted
work
and
does
that
make
her
your
friend
do
you
give
your
friendship
so
easily
you
forget
that
i
known
her
for
years
well
now
i
not
i
seen
her
about
three
times
in
my
life
and
spoken
two
words
to
her
perhaps
twice
and
yet
i
describe
her
character
to
you
and
if
you
can
say
that
the
description
is
incorrect
i
will
permit
you
to
call
her
your
friend
well
let
hear
the
character
it
would
be
kind
in
me
though
to
laugh
at
your
oh
she
not
so
especially
and
particularly
my
friend
that
you
need
mind
that
then
you
promise
not
to
be
angry
oh
no
i
wo
be
angry
well
then
she
has
two
passions
they
are
for
worsted
and
she
has
a
moral
objection
to
waltzing
theoretically
she
disapproves
of
flirtations
she
encourages
correspondence
between
young
ladies
always
crosses
her
letters
and
never
finished
one
for
the
last
ten
years
without
expressing
entire
resignation
to
the
will
of
god
as
if
she
could
be
resigned
without
so
often
saying
so
she
speaks
to
her
confidential
friends
of
young
men
as
a
very
worthless
insignificant
race
of
beings
she
is
however
prepared
to
take
the
very
first
that
may
be
unfortunate
enough
to
come
in
her
way
she
has
no
ideas
of
her
own
but
is
quick
enough
at
borrowing
those
of
other
people
she
considers
herself
a
profound
theologian
dotes
on
a
converted
papist
and
looks
on
a
puseyite
as
something
one
shade
blacker
than
the
devil
now
is
that
sufficiently
like
for
a
portrait
footnote
puseyite
a
follower
of
edward
pusey
one
of
three
scholars
at
oxford
who
started
a
movement
critical
of
the
church
of
england
one
of
the
three
john
henry
newman
converted
to
catholicism
and
pusey
and
his
followers
were
accused
of
advocating
catholic
practices
it
the
portrait
of
a
set
i
fear
rather
than
an
individual
i
know
that
it
particularly
like
miss
except
as
to
the
worsted
and
what
not
as
to
the
waltzing
resignation
and
worthless
young
men
come
are
they
not
exactly
her
traits
does
she
waltz
no
she
does
not
and
have
you
heard
her
express
a
moral
objection
to
it
well
i
believe
i
have
did
you
ever
get
a
letter
from
her
or
see
a
letter
of
hers
i
do
remember
yes
i
did
once
a
long
time
ago
and
was
she
very
resigned
in
it
well
i
declare
i
believe
she
was
and
it
very
proper
too
people
ought
to
be
resigned
oh
of
course
and
now
does
she
love
a
convert
and
hate
a
puseyite
all
irish
clergyman
daughters
do
that
well
fanny
you
ca
say
but
that
it
was
a
good
portrait
and
after
that
will
you
pretend
to
say
you
call
miss
your
friend
not
my
very
friend
of
friends
but
as
friends
go
she
as
good
as
most
others
and
who
is
the
friend
of
friends
fanny
come
you
not
my
father
confessor
i
not
to
tell
you
all
if
i
told
you
that
you
make
another
portrait
i
sure
i
could
draw
a
disparaging
picture
of
anybody
you
would
really
call
your
friend
but
indeed
i
pity
you
living
among
so
many
such
people
there
can
be
nobody
here
who
understands
you
oh
i
not
very
unintelligible
much
more
so
than
miss
i
should
wish
to
have
to
draw
your
portrait
pray
do
if
it
were
frightful
i
should
think
you
uncivil
and
if
you
made
it
handsome
i
should
know
you
were
flattering
besides
you
do
know
enough
of
me
to
tell
me
my
character
i
think
i
do
but
i
study
it
a
little
more
before
i
put
it
on
the
canvass
some
likenesses
are
very
hard
to
catch
fanny
felt
when
she
went
to
bed
that
she
had
spent
a
pleasanter
evening
than
she
usually
did
and
that
it
was
a
much
less
nuisance
to
talk
to
her
cousin
adolphus
than
to
either
his
father
mother
or
sister
and
as
she
sat
before
her
fire
while
her
maid
was
brushing
her
hair
she
began
to
think
that
she
had
mistaken
his
character
and
that
he
could
be
the
hard
sensual
selfish
man
for
which
she
had
taken
him
her
ideas
naturally
fell
back
to
frank
and
her
love
her
difficulties
and
sorrows
and
before
she
went
to
sleep
she
had
almost
taught
herself
to
think
that
she
might
make
lord
kilcullen
the
means
of
bringing
lord
ballindine
back
to
grey
abbey
she
had
to
be
sure
been
told
that
her
cousin
had
spoken
ill
of
frank
that
it
was
he
who
had
been
foremost
in
decrying
lord
folly
and
extravagance
but
she
had
never
heard
him
do
so
she
had
only
heard
of
it
through
lord
cashel
and
she
quite
ceased
to
believe
anything
her
guardian
might
say
respecting
her
discarded
lover
at
any
rate
she
would
try
some
step
she
was
determined
to
take
about
lord
ballindine
and
if
her
cousin
refused
to
act
like
a
cousin
and
a
friend
she
would
only
be
exactly
where
she
was
before
xxxi
the
two
friends
the
next
three
days
passed
slowly
and
tediously
for
most
of
the
guests
assembled
at
grey
abbey
captain
cokely
and
a
mr
battersby
came
over
from
newbridge
barracks
but
they
did
not
add
much
to
the
general
enjoyment
of
the
party
though
their
arrival
was
hailed
with
delight
by
some
of
the
young
ladies
at
any
rate
they
made
the
rooms
look
less
forlorn
in
the
evenings
and
made
it
worth
the
girls
while
to
put
on
their
best
bibs
and
tuckers
but
what
the
use
of
it
at
all
said
matilda
fitzgerald
to
little
letty
when
she
had
spent
of
an
hour
in
adjusting
her
curls
and
setting
her
flounces
properly
on
the
evening
before
the
arrival
of
the
two
cavalry
officers
not
a
soul
to
look
at
us
but
a
crusty
old
colonel
a
musty
old
bishop
and
a
fusty
old
beau
who
the
old
beau
said
letty
why
that
mr
tierney
i
ca
conceive
how
lady
cashel
can
have
asked
us
to
meet
such
a
set
and
matilda
descended
pouting
and
out
of
humour
but
on
the
next
day
she
went
through
her
work
much
more
willingly
if
not
more
carefully
that
captain
cokely
a
very
nice
fellow
said
matilda
the
best
of
that
newbridge
set
out
and
out
well
now
i
really
think
he
not
so
nice
as
mr
battersby
said
letty
i
sure
he
not
so
oh
battersby
only
a
boy
after
all
letty
i
do
know
whether
i
like
officers
so
much
better
than
other
men
and
she
twisted
her
neck
round
to
get
a
look
at
her
back
in
the
and
gave
her
dress
a
little
pull
just
above
her
bustle
i
sure
i
do
said
letty
they
so
much
more
to
say
for
themselves
and
they
so
much
smarter
why
yes
they
are
smarter
said
matilda
and
there
nothing
on
earth
so
dowdy
as
an
old
black
coat
but
then
officers
are
always
going
away
you
no
sooner
get
to
know
one
or
two
of
a
set
and
to
feel
that
one
of
them
is
really
a
darling
fellow
but
there
they
are
off
to
jamaica
china
hounslow
barracks
or
somewhere
and
then
all
to
do
over
again
well
i
do
wish
they
would
move
them
about
quite
so
much
but
let
go
down
i
think
i
do
now
wo
i
and
they
descended
to
begin
the
evening
campaign
was
miss
wyndham
engaged
to
some
one
said
old
mrs
ellison
to
mrs
moore
i
sure
some
one
told
me
so
oh
yes
she
was
said
mrs
moore
the
affair
was
settled
and
everything
arranged
but
the
man
was
very
poor
and
a
gambler
lord
ballindine
he
has
the
name
of
a
property
down
in
mayo
somewhere
but
when
she
got
all
her
brother
money
lord
cashel
thought
it
a
pity
to
sacrifice
it
so
he
got
her
out
of
the
scrape
a
very
good
thing
for
the
poor
girl
for
they
say
he
a
desperate
scamp
well
i
declare
i
think
said
mrs
ellison
she
not
have
far
to
look
for
another
what
you
think
there
something
between
her
and
lord
kilcullen
said
mrs
moore
it
looks
like
it
at
any
rate
do
it
said
mrs
ellison
well
i
really
think
it
does
said
mrs
moore
i
sure
i
be
very
glad
of
it
i
know
he
wants
money
desperately
and
it
would
be
such
a
capital
thing
for
the
earl
at
any
rate
the
lady
does
not
look
a
bit
unwilling
said
mrs
ellison
i
suppose
she
fond
of
rakish
young
men
you
say
lord
ballindine
was
of
that
set
and
i
sure
lord
kilcullen
the
same
he
has
the
reputation
at
any
rate
they
say
he
and
his
father
never
speak
except
just
in
public
to
avoid
the
show
of
the
thing
and
the
two
old
ladies
set
to
work
to
a
good
dish
of
scandal
miss
wyndham
an
exceedingly
fine
girl
said
captain
cokely
to
mat
tierney
as
they
were
playing
a
game
of
piquet
in
the
little
yes
said
mat
and
she
a
hundred
thousand
exceedingly
fine
charms
too
independently
of
her
fine
face
so
i
hear
said
cokely
but
i
only
believe
half
of
what
i
hear
about
those
things
she
has
more
than
that
i
know
it
has
she
though
faith
do
you
know
i
think
kilcullen
has
a
mind
to
keep
it
in
the
family
he
very
soft
on
her
and
she
just
as
sweet
to
him
i
should
be
surprised
if
he
were
to
marry
now
and
turn
steady
not
at
all
there
are
two
reasons
against
it
in
the
first
place
too
much
dipped
for
even
fanny
fortune
to
be
any
good
to
him
and
secondly
she
engaged
what
to
ballindine
said
cokely
exactly
so
said
mat
ah
my
dear
fellow
that
all
off
long
since
i
heard
kilcullen
say
so
myself
i
back
kilcullen
to
marry
her
against
ballindine
for
a
hundred
pounds
done
said
mat
and
the
bet
was
booked
the
same
evening
tierney
wrote
to
dot
blake
and
said
in
a
postscript
i
know
you
care
for
ballindine
so
do
i
but
i
do
write
to
him
if
he
really
wants
to
secure
his
he
should
see
that
she
does
get
bagged
in
his
absence
kilcullen
is
here
and
i
tell
you
he
a
keen
sportsman
they
say
it
quite
up
with
him
in
london
and
i
should
be
sorry
she
were
sacrificed
she
seems
a
nice
girl
lord
kilcullen
had
ample
opportunities
of
forwarding
his
intimacy
with
fanny
and
he
did
not
neglect
them
to
give
him
his
due
he
played
his
cards
as
well
as
his
father
could
wish
him
he
first
of
all
overcame
the
dislike
with
which
she
was
prepared
to
regard
him
he
then
interested
her
about
himself
and
before
he
had
been
a
week
at
grey
abbey
she
felt
that
she
had
a
sort
of
cousinly
affection
for
him
he
got
her
to
talk
with
a
degree
of
interest
about
himself
and
when
he
could
do
that
there
was
no
wonder
that
tierney
should
have
fears
for
his
friend
interests
not
that
there
was
any
real
occasion
for
them
fanny
wyndham
was
not
the
girl
to
be
talked
out
of
or
into
a
real
passion
by
anyone
now
tell
me
the
truth
fanny
said
kilcullen
as
they
were
sitting
over
the
fire
together
in
the
library
one
dark
afternoon
before
they
went
to
dress
for
dinner
had
you
been
taught
to
look
on
me
as
a
kind
of
ogre
a
monster
of
iniquity
who
spoke
nothing
but
oaths
and
did
nothing
but
sin
not
exactly
that
but
i
wo
say
i
thought
you
were
exactly
just
what
you
ought
to
be
but
did
you
think
i
was
exactly
what
i
ought
not
to
have
been
did
you
imagine
now
that
i
habitually
sat
up
all
night
gambling
and
drinking
buckets
of
champagne
and
and
that
i
lay
in
bed
all
day
devising
iniquity
in
my
dreams
come
now
tell
the
truth
and
shame
the
devil
if
i
am
the
devil
i
know
people
have
made
me
out
to
be
why
really
adolphus
i
never
calculated
how
your
days
and
nights
were
spent
but
if
i
am
to
tell
the
truth
i
fear
some
of
them
might
have
been
passed
to
better
advantage
which
of
us
fanny
might
with
truth
say
the
same
of
ourselves
of
course
none
of
us
said
fanny
do
think
i
judging
you
you
asked
me
the
question
and
i
suppose
you
wanted
an
answer
i
did
i
wanted
a
true
one
for
though
you
may
never
have
given
yourself
much
trouble
to
form
an
opinion
about
me
i
am
anxious
that
you
should
do
so
now
i
do
want
to
trouble
you
with
what
is
done
and
past
i
do
want
to
make
it
appear
that
i
have
not
been
thoughtless
and
imprudent
wicked
and
iniquitous
if
you
are
fond
of
strong
terms
neither
do
i
want
to
trouble
you
with
confessing
all
my
improprieties
that
i
may
regularly
receive
absolution
but
i
do
wish
you
to
believe
that
i
have
done
nothing
which
should
exclude
me
from
your
future
good
opinion
from
your
friendship
and
esteem
i
am
not
of
an
unforgiving
temperament
even
had
you
done
anything
for
me
to
forgive
but
i
am
not
aware
that
you
have
no
nothing
for
you
to
forgive
in
the
light
of
an
offence
to
yourself
but
much
perhaps
to
prevent
your
being
willing
to
regard
me
as
a
personal
friend
we
not
only
first
cousins
fanny
but
are
placed
more
closely
together
than
cousins
usually
are
you
have
neither
father
nor
mother
now
also
you
have
no
brother
and
he
took
her
hands
in
his
own
as
he
said
so
who
should
be
a
brother
to
you
if
i
am
not
who
at
any
rate
should
you
look
on
as
a
friend
if
not
on
me
nobody
could
be
better
i
believe
than
selina
but
she
is
stiff
and
cold
unlike
you
in
everything
i
should
be
so
happy
if
i
could
be
the
friend
the
friend
of
friends
you
spoke
of
the
other
evening
if
i
could
fill
the
place
which
must
be
empty
near
your
heart
i
can
never
be
this
to
you
if
you
believe
that
anything
in
my
past
life
has
been
really
disgraceful
it
is
for
this
reason
that
i
want
to
know
what
you
truly
think
of
me
i
wo
deny
that
i
am
anxious
you
should
think
well
of
me
well
at
any
rate
for
the
present
and
the
future
and
charitably
as
regards
the
past
fanny
had
been
taken
much
by
surprise
by
the
turn
her
cousin
had
given
to
the
conversation
and
was
so
much
affected
that
before
he
had
finished
she
was
in
tears
she
had
taken
her
hand
out
of
his
to
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
and
as
she
did
not
immediately
answer
he
continued
i
shall
probably
be
much
here
for
some
time
to
come
such
at
least
are
my
present
plans
and
i
hope
that
while
i
am
we
shall
become
friends
not
such
friends
fanny
as
you
and

friends
only
of
circumstance
who
have
neither
tastes
habits
or
feelings
in
common
friends
whose
friendship
consists
in
living
in
the
same
parish
and
meeting
each
other
once
or
twice
a
week
but
friends
in
reality
friends
in
confidence
friends
in
mutual
dependence
friends
in
love
friends
dear
fanny
as
cousins
situated
as
we
are
should
be
to
each
other
fanny
heart
was
very
full
for
she
felt
how
much
how
desperately
she
wanted
such
a
friend
as
kilcullen
described
how
delightful
it
would
be
to
have
such
a
friend
and
to
find
him
in
her
own
cousin
the
whole
family
hitherto
were
so
cold
to
her
so
uncongenial
the
earl
she
absolutely
disliked
she
loved
her
aunt
but
it
was
only
because
she
was
her
aunt
she
could
like
her
and
though
she
loved
lady
selina
and
to
a
degree
admired
her
it
was
like
loving
a
marble
figure
there
was
more
true
feeling
in
what
kilcullen
had
now
said
to
her
than
in
all
that
had
fallen
from
the
whole
family
for
the
four
years
she
had
lived
at
grey
abbey
and
she
could
not
therefore
but
close
on
the
offer
of
his
affection
shall
we
be
such
friends
then
said
he
or
after
all
am
i
too
bad
have
i
too
much
of
the
taint
of
the
wicked
world
to
be
the
friend
of
so
pure
a
creature
as
you
oh
no
adolphus
i
sure
i
never
thought
so
said
she
i
never
judged
you
and
indeed
i
am
not
disposed
to
do
so
now
i
too
much
in
want
of
kindness
to
reject
yours
even
were
i
disposed
to
do
so
which
i
am
not
then
fanny
we
are
to
be
friends
true
loving
trusting
friends
oh
yes
said
fanny
i
am
really
truly
grateful
for
your
affection
and
kindness
i
know
how
precious
they
are
and
i
will
value
them
accordingly
again
lord
kilcullen
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
in
his
and
then
he
kissed
it
and
told
her
she
was
his
own
dear
cousin
fanny
and
then
recommended
her
to
go
and
dress
which
she
did
he
sat
himself
down
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ruminating
and
then
also
went
off
to
dress
but
during
that
quarter
of
an
hour
very
different
ideas
passed
through
his
mind
than
such
as
those
who
knew
him
best
would
have
given
him
credit
for
in
the
first
place
he
thought
that
he
really
began
to
feel
an
affection
for
his
cousin
fanny
and
to
speculate
whether
it
were
absolutely
within
the
verge
of
possibility
that
he
should
marry
her
retrieve
his
circumstances
treat
her
well
and
live
happily
for
the
rest
of
his
life
as
a
respectable
nobleman
for
two
or
three
minutes
the
illusion
remained
till
it
was
banished
by
retrospection
it
was
certainly
possible
that
he
should
marry
her
it
was
his
full
intention
to
do
so
but
as
to
retrieving
his
circumstances
and
treating
her
well
the
first
was
absolutely
impossible
the
other
nearly
so
and
as
to
his
living
happily
at
grey
abbey
as
a
family
man
he
yawned
as
he
felt
how
impossible
it
would
be
that
he
should
spend
a
month
in
such
a
way
let
alone
a
life
but
then
fanny
wyndham
was
so
beautiful
so
lively
so
affectionate
so
exactly
what
a
cousin
and
a
wife
ought
to
be
he
could
not
bear
to
think
that
all
his
protestations
of
friendship
and
love
had
been
hypocritical
that
he
could
only
look
upon
her
as
a
gudgeon
and
himself
as
a
bigger
fish
determined
to
swallow
her
yet
such
must
be
his
views
regarding
her
he
departed
to
dress
absolutely
troubled
in
his
conscience
and
what
were
fanny
thoughts
about
her
cousin
she
was
much
surprised
and
gratified
but
at
the
same
time
somewhat
flustered
and
overwhelmed
by
the
warmth
and
novelty
of
his
affection
however
she
never
for
a
moment
doubted
his
truth
towards
her
or
had
the
slightest
suspicion
of
his
real
object
her
chief
thought
was
whether
she
could
induce
him
to
be
a
mediator
for
her
between
lord
cashel
and
lord
ballindine
during
the
next
two
days
he
spoke
to
her
a
good
deal
about
her
brother
of
whom
he
had
really
known
nothing
he
contrived
however
to
praise
him
as
a
young
man
of
much
spirit
and
great
promise
then
he
spoke
of
her
own
large
fortune
asked
her
what
her
wishes
were
about
its
investment
and
told
her
how
happy
he
would
be
to
express
those
wishes
at
once
to
lord
cashel
and
to
see
that
they
were
carried
out
once
or
twice
she
had
gradually
attempted
to
lead
the
conversation
to
lord
ballindine
but
kilcullen
was
too
crafty
and
had
prevented
her
and
she
had
not
yet
sufficient
courage
to
tell
him
at
once
what
was
so
near
her
heart
fanny
said
lady
selina
one
morning
about
a
week
after
the
general
arrival
of
the
company
at
grey
abbey
and
when
some
of
them
had
taken
their
departure
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
have
recovered
your
spirits
i
know
you
have
made
a
great
effort
and
i
appreciate
and
admire
it
indeed
selina
i
fear
you
are
admiring
me
too
soon
i
own
i
have
been
amused
this
week
past
and
to
a
certain
degree
pleased
but
i
fear
you
find
i
shall
relapse
there
been
no
radical
reform
my
thoughts
are
all
in
the
same
direction
as
they
were
but
the
great
trial
in
this
world
is
to
behave
well
and
becomingly
in
spite
of
oppressive
thoughts
and
it
always
takes
a
struggle
to
do
that
and
that
struggle
you
made
i
hope
it
may
lead
you
to
feel
that
you
may
be
contented
and
in
comfort
without
having
everything
which
you
think
necessary
to
your
happiness
i
sure
i
looked
forward
to
this
week
as
one
of
unmixed
trouble
and
torment
but
i
was
very
wrong
to
do
so
it
has
given
me
a
great
deal
of
unmixed
satisfaction
i
very
glad
of
that
selina
but
what
was
it
i
sure
it
could
not
have
come
from
poor
mrs
ellison
or
the
bishop
wife
and
you
seemed
to
me
to
spend
all
your
time
in
talking
to
them
virtue
they
say
is
its
own
reward
i
do
know
what
other
satisfaction
you
can
have
had
from
them
in
the
first
place
it
has
given
me
great
pleasure
to
see
that
you
were
able
to
exert
yourself
in
company
and
that
the
crowd
of
people
did
not
annoy
you
but
i
have
chiefly
been
delighted
by
seeing
that
you
and
adolphus
are
such
good
friends
you
must
think
fanny
that
i
am
anxious
about
an
only
brother
especially
when
we
have
all
had
so
much
cause
to
be
anxious
about
him
and
do
you
think
it
must
be
a
delight
to
me
to
find
that
he
is
able
to
take
pleasure
in
your
society
i
should
be
doubly
pleased
doubly
delighted
if
i
could
please
him
myself
but
i
have
not
the
vivacity
to
amuse
him
what
nonsense
selina
do
say
that
but
it
true
fanny
i
have
not
and
grey
abbey
has
become
distasteful
to
him
because
we
are
all
sedate
steady
people
perhaps
some
would
call
us
dull
and
heavy
and
i
have
grieved
that
it
should
be
so
though
i
can
not
alter
my
nature
but
you
are
so
much
the
contrary
there
is
so
much
in
your
character
like
his
own
before
he
became
fond
of
the
world
that
i
feel
he
can
become
attached
to
and
fond
of
you
and
i
am
delighted
to
see
that
he
thinks
so
himself
what
do
you
think
of
him
now
that
you
have
seen
more
of
him
than
you
ever
did
before
indeed
said
fanny
i
like
him
very
much
he
is
very
clever
is
he
he
might
have
been
anything
if
he
had
given
himself
fair
play
he
seems
to
have
taken
greatly
to
you
oh
yes
we
are
great
friends
and
then
fanny
paused
so
great
friends
she
continued
looking
somewhat
gravely
in
lady
face
that
i
mean
to
ask
the
greatest
favour
of
him
that
i
could
ask
of
anyone
one
i
am
sure
i
little
dreamed
i
should
ever
ask
of
him
what
is
it
fanny
is
it
a
secret
indeed
it
is
selina
but
it
a
secret
i
will
tell
you
i
mean
to
tell
him
all
i
feel
about
lord
ballindine
and
i
mean
to
ask
him
to
see
him
for
me
adolphus
has
offered
to
be
a
brother
to
me
and
i
mean
to
take
him
at
his
word
lady
selina
turned
very
pale
and
looked
very
grave
as
she
replied
that
is
not
giving
him
a
brother
work
fanny
a
brother
should
protect
you
from
importunity
and
insult
from
injury
and
wrong
and
that
i
am
sure
adolphus
would
do
but
no
brother
would
consent
to
offer
your
hand
to
a
man
who
had
neglected
you
and
been
refused
and
who
in
all
probability
would
now
reject
you
with
scorn
if
he
has
the
opportunity
or
if
not
that
will
take
you
for
your
money
sake
that
fanny
is
not
a
brother
work
and
it
is
an
embassy
which
i
am
sure
adolphus
will
not
undertake
if
you
take
my
advice
you
will
not
ask
him
as
lady
selina
finished
speaking
she
walked
to
the
door
as
if
determined
to
hear
no
reply
from
her
cousin
but
as
she
was
leaving
the
room
she
fancied
that
she
heard
her
sobbing
and
her
heart
softened
and
she
again
turned
towards
her
and
said
god
knows
fanny
i
do
not
wish
to
be
severe
or
to
you
i
would
do
anything
for
your
comfort
and
happiness
but
i
can
not
bear
to
think
that
you
should
lady
selina
was
puzzled
for
a
word
to
express
her
meaning
that
you
should
forget
yourself
and
she
attempted
to
put
her
arm
round
fanny
waist
but
she
was
mistaken
fanny
was
not
sobbing
but
was
angry
and
what
selina
now
said
about
her
forgetting
herself
did
not
make
her
less
so
no
she
said
withdrawing
herself
from
her
cousin
embrace
and
standing
erect
while
her
bosom
was
swelling
with
indignation
i
want
no
affection
from
you
selina
that
is
accompanied
by
so
much
disapprobation
you
do
wish
to
be
severe
only
you
say
that
i
am
likely
to
forget
myself
forget
myself
and
fanny
threw
back
her
beautiful
head
and
clenched
her
little
fists
by
her
side
the
other
day
you
said
myself
and
i
bore
it
calmly
then
but
i
will
not
any
longer
bear
such
imputations
i
tell
you
plainly
selina
i
will
not
forget
myself
nor
will
i
be
forgotten
nor
will
i
submit
to
whatever
fate
cold
unfeeling
people
may
doom
me
merely
because
i
am
a
woman
and
alone
i
will
not
give
up
lord
ballindine
if
i
have
to
walk
to
his
door
and
tell
him
so
and
were
i
to
do
so
i
should
never
think
that
i
had
forgotten
myself
listen
to
me
fanny
said
selina
wait
a
moment
continued
fanny
i
have
listened
enough
it
is
my
turn
to
speak
now
for
one
thing
i
have
to
thank
you
you
have
dispelled
the
idea
that
i
could
look
for
help
to
anyone
in
this
family
i
will
not
ask
your
brother
to
do
anything
for
me
which
you
think
so
disgraceful
i
will
not
subject
him
to
the
scorn
with
which
you
choose
to
think
my
love
will
be
treated
by
him
who
loved
me
so
well
that
you
should
dare
to
tell
me
that
he
who
did
so
much
for
my
love
should
now
scorn
it
oh
selina
that
i
may
live
to
forget
that
you
said
those
words
and
fanny
for
a
moment
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
but
it
was
but
for
a
moment
however
she
continued
i
will
now
act
for
myself
as
you
think
i
might
forget
myself
i
tell
you
i
will
do
it
in
no
clandestine
way
i
will
write
to
lord
ballindine
and
i
will
show
my
letter
to
my
uncle
the
whole
house
shall
read
it
if
they
please
i
will
tell
lord
ballindine
all
the
truth
and
if
lord
cashel
turns
me
from
his
house
i
shall
probably
find
some
friend
to
receive
me
who
may
still
believe
that
i
have
not
forgotten
myself
and
fanny
wyndham
sailed
out
of
the
room
lady
selina
when
she
saw
that
she
was
gone
sat
down
on
the
sofa
and
took
her
book
she
tried
to
make
herself
believe
that
she
was
going
to
read
but
it
was
no
use
the
tears
dimmed
her
eyes
and
she
put
the
book
down
the
same
evening
the
countess
sent
for
selina
into
her
boudoir
and
with
a
fidgety
mixture
of
delight
and
surprise
told
her
that
she
had
a
wonderful
piece
of
good
news
to
communicate
to
her
i
declare
my
dear
she
said
it
the
most
delightful
thing
heard
for
years
and
years
and
it
just
exactly
what
i
had
planned
myself
only
i
never
told
anybody
dear
me
it
makes
me
so
happy
what
is
it
mamma
your
papa
has
been
talking
to
me
since
dinner
my
love
and
he
tells
me
adolphus
is
going
to
marry
fanny
wyndham
going
to
marry
whom
said
lady
selina
almost
with
a
shout
fanny
i
say
it
the
most
delightful
match
in
the
world
it
just
what
ought
to
be
done
i
suppose
they
wo
have
the
wedding
before
summer
though
may
is
a
very
nice
month
let
me
see
it
only
wants
three
weeks
to
may
mamma
what
are
you
talking
about
you
dreaming
dreaming
my
dear
i
not
dreaming
at
all
it
a
fact
thought
of
all
this
happening
so
soon
out
of
this
party
which
gave
us
so
much
trouble
however
i
knew
your
father
was
right
i
said
all
along
that
he
was
in
the
right
to
ask
the
people
mamma
said
lady
selina
gravely
listen
to
me
calmly
now
and
attentively
i
do
know
what
papa
has
told
you
but
i
tell
you
fanny
does
not
dream
of
marrying
adolphus
he
has
never
asked
her
and
if
he
did
she
would
never
accept
him
fanny
is
more
than
ever
in
love
with
lord
ballindine
the
countess
opened
her
eyes
wide
and
looked
up
into
her
face
but
said
nothing
tell
me
mamma
as
nearly
as
you
can
recollect
what
it
is
papa
has
said
to
you
that
if
possible
we
may
prevent
mischief
and
misery
papa
could
have
said
that
fanny
had
accepted
adolphus
he
did
say
exactly
that
my
dear
but
he
said
that
it
was
his
wish
they
should
be
married
that
adolphus
was
very
eager
for
it
and
that
fanny
had
received
his
attentions
and
admiration
with
evident
pleasure
and
satisfaction
and
so
she
has
my
dear
you
could
but
have
seen
that
yourself
well
mamma
what
else
did
papa
say
why
he
said
just
what
i
telling
you
that
i
was
to
be
surprised
if
we
were
called
on
to
be
ready
for
the
wedding
at
a
short
notice
or
at
any
rate
to
be
ready
to
congratulate
fanny
he
certainly
say
she
had
accepted
him
but
he
said
he
had
no
doubt
about
it
and
i
sure
from
what
was
going
on
last
week
i
could
have
any
doubt
either
but
he
told
me
not
to
speak
to
anyone
about
it
yet
particularly
not
to
fanny
only
my
dear
i
could
help
you
know
talking
it
over
with
you
and
the
countess
leaned
back
in
her
chair
very
much
exhausted
with
the
history
she
had
narrated
now
mamma
listen
to
me
it
is
not
many
hours
since
fanny
told
me
she
was
unalterably
determined
to
throw
herself
at
lord
ballindine
feet
goodness
gracious
me
how
shocking
said
the
countess
she
even
said
that
she
would
ask
adolphus
to
be
the
means
of
bringing
lord
ballindine
back
to
grey
abbey
lord
have
mercy
said
the
countess
i
only
tell
you
this
mamma
to
show
you
how
impossible
it
is
that
papa
should
be
right
what
are
we
to
do
my
dear
oh
dear
there
be
such
a
piece
of
work
what
a
nasty
thing
fanny
is
i
sure
she
been
making
love
to
adolphus
all
the
week
no
mamma
she
has
not
do
be
unfair
to
fanny
if
there
is
anyone
in
fault
it
is
adolphus
but
as
you
say
what
shall
we
do
to
prevent
further
misunderstanding
i
think
i
had
better
tell
papa
the
whole
and
so
she
did
on
the
following
morning
but
she
was
too
late
she
did
not
do
it
till
after
lord
kilcullen
had
offered
and
had
been
refused
xxxii
how
lord
kilcullen
fares
in
his
wooing
about
twelve
the
same
night
lord
kilcullen
and
mat
tierney
were
playing
billiards
and
were
just
finishing
their
last
game
the
were
lighted
ready
for
them
and
tierney
was
on
the
point
of
making
the
final
hazard
so
you
determined
to
go
mat
said
kilcullen
oh
yes
i
go
your
mother
take
me
for
a
second
paddy
rea
else
said
mat
who
the
deuce
was
paddy
rea
did
you
ever
hear
of
paddy
rea
michael
french
of
glare
abbey
he
dead
now
but
he
was
alive
enough
at
the
time
i
telling
you
of
and
kept
the
best
house
in
county
clare
well
he
was
coming
down
on
the
limerick
coach
and
met
a
deuced
pleasant
talkative
sort
of
a
fellow
of
it
they
dined
and
got
a
tumbler
of
punch
together
at
roscrea
and
when
french
got
down
at
bird
hill
he
told
his
acquaintance
that
if
he
ever
found
himself
anywhere
near
ennis
he
be
glad
to
see
him
at
glare
abbey
he
was
a
hospitable
sort
of
a
fellow
and
had
got
into
a
kind
of
way
of
saying
the
same
thing
to
everybody
without
meaning
anything
except
to
be
civil
just
as
i
wish
a
man
good
morning
well
french
thought
no
more
about
the
man
whose
name
he
did
even
know
but
about
a
fortnight
afterwards
a
hack
car
from
ennis
made
its
appearance
at
glare
abbey
and
the
talkative
traveller
and
a
small
portmanteau
had
soon
found
their
way
into
the
hail
french
was
a
good
deal
annoyed
for
he
had
some
fashionables
in
the
house
but
he
could
turn
the
man
out
so
he
asked
his
name
and
introduced
paddy
rea
to
the
company
how
long
do
you
think
he
stayed
at
glare
abbey
heaven
only
knows
three
months
seventeen
years
said
mat
they
did
everything
to
turn
him
out
and
could
do
it
it
killed
old
french
and
at
last
his
son
pulled
the
house
down
and
paddy
rea
went
then
because
there
was
a
roof
to
cover
him
now
i
do
want
to
drive
your
father
to
pull
down
this
house
so
i
go
the
place
is
so
ugly
that
if
you
could
make
him
do
so
it
would
be
an
advantage
but
i
afraid
the
plan
would
succeed
so
i
wo
press
you
but
if
you
go
i
sha
remain
long
if
it
was
to
save
my
life
and
theirs
i
ca
get
up
small
talk
for
the
rector
and
his
curate
well
good
night
said
mat
and
the
two
turned
off
towards
their
as
they
passed
from
the
through
the
hall
lord
cashel
shuffled
out
of
his
room
in
his
slippers
and
kilcullen
said
he
with
a
great
deal
of
unconcerned
good
humour
affected
in
his
tone
just
give
me
one
moment
i
a
word
to
say
to
you
goodnight
mr
tierney
goodnight
i
sorry
to
hear
we
to
lose
you
lord
kilcullen
shrugged
his
shoulders
winked
at
his
friend
and
then
turned
round
and
followed
his
father
it
only
one
word
kilcullen
said
the
father
who
was
afraid
of
angering
or
irritating
his
son
now
that
he
thought
he
was
in
so
fair
a
way
to
obtain
the
heiress
and
her
fortune
i
not
detain
you
half
a
minute
and
then
he
said
in
a
whisper
take
my
advice
kilcullen
and
strike
when
the
iron
hot
i
do
quite
understand
you
my
lord
said
his
son
affecting
ignorance
of
his
father
meaning
i
mean
you
ca
stand
better
than
you
do
with
fanny
certainly
played
your
cards
admirably
and
she
a
charming
girl
a
very
charming
girl
and
i
long
to
know
that
she
your
own
take
my
advice
and
ask
her
at
once
my
lord
said
the
dutiful
son
if
i
to
carry
on
this
affair
i
must
be
allowed
to
do
it
in
my
own
way
you
i
dare
say
have
more
experience
than
i
can
boast
and
if
you
choose
to
make
the
proposal
yourself
to
miss
wyndham
on
my
behalf
i
shall
be
delighted
to
leave
the
matter
in
your
hands
but
in
that
case
i
shall
choose
to
be
absent
from
grey
abbey
if
you
wish
me
to
do
it
you
must
let
me
do
it
when
i
please
and
how
i
please
oh
certainly
certainly
kilcullen
said
the
earl
i
only
want
to
point
out
that
i
think
you
gain
nothing
by
delay
very
well
my
lord
good
night
and
lord
kilcullen
went
to
bed
and
the
father
shuffled
back
to
his
study
he
had
had
three
different
letters
that
day
from
lord
kilcullen
creditors
all
threatening
immediate
arrest
unless
he
would
make
himself
responsible
for
his
debts
no
wonder
that
he
was
in
a
hurry
poor
man
and
lord
kilcullen
though
he
had
spoken
so
coolly
on
the
subject
and
had
snubbed
his
father
was
equally
in
a
hurry
he
also
received
letters
and
threats
and
warnings
and
understood
even
better
than
his
father
did
the
perils
which
awaited
him
he
knew
that
he
remain
at
grey
abbey
another
week
that
in
a
day
or
two
it
would
be
safe
for
him
to
leave
the
house
and
that
his
only
chance
was
at
once
to
obtain
the
promise
of
his
cousin
hand
and
then
betake
himself
to
some
place
of
security
till
he
could
make
her
fortune
available
when
fanny
came
into
the
next
morning
he
asked
her
to
walk
with
him
in
the
demesne
after
breakfast
during
the
whole
of
the
previous
evening
she
had
sat
silent
and
alone
pretending
to
read
although
he
had
made
two
or
three
efforts
to
engage
her
in
conversation
she
could
not
however
refuse
to
walk
with
him
nor
could
she
quite
forgive
herself
for
wishing
to
do
so
she
felt
that
her
sudden
attachment
for
him
was
damped
by
what
had
passed
between
her
and
lady
selina
but
she
knew
at
the
same
time
that
she
was
very
unreasonable
for
quarrelling
with
one
cousin
for
what
another
had
said
she
accepted
his
invitation
and
shortly
after
breakfast
went
upstairs
to
get
ready
it
was
a
fine
bright
april
morning
though
the
air
was
cold
and
the
ground
somewhat
damp
so
she
put
on
her
boa
and
strong
boots
and
sallied
forth
with
lord
kilcullen
not
exactly
in
a
good
humour
but
still
feeling
that
she
could
not
justly
be
out
of
humour
with
him
at
the
same
moment
lady
selina
knocked
at
her
father
door
with
the
intention
of
explaining
to
him
how
impossible
it
was
that
fanny
should
be
persuaded
to
marry
her
brother
poor
lord
cashel
his
life
at
that
time
was
certainly
not
a
happy
one
the
two
cousins
walked
some
way
nearly
in
silence
fanny
felt
very
little
inclined
to
talk
and
even
kilcullen
with
all
his
knowledge
of
womankind
with
all
his
assurance
had
some
difficulty
in
commencing
what
he
had
to
get
said
and
done
that
morning
so
grey
abbey
will
once
more
sink
into
its
accustomed
dullness
said
he
cokely
went
yesterday
and
tierney
and
the
ellisons
go
do
you
dread
it
fanny
oh
i
used
to
it
besides
i
one
of
the
component
elements
of
the
dullness
you
know
i
a
portion
of
the
thing
itself
it
you
that
must
feel
it
i
feel
it
i
suppose
i
shall
but
as
i
told
you
before
the
physic
to
me
was
not
nearly
so
nauseous
as
the
sugar
i
at
any
rate
glad
to
get
rid
of
such
sweetmeats
as
the
bishop
and
mrs
ellison
and
they
were
both
silent
again
for
a
while
but
you
not
a
portion
of
the
heaviness
of
grey
abbey
fanny
said
he
referring
to
what
she
had
said
you
not
an
element
of
its
dullness
i
do
say
this
in
flattery
i
trust
nothing
so
vile
as
flattery
will
ever
take
place
between
us
but
you
know
yourself
that
your
nature
is
intended
for
other
things
that
you
were
not
born
to
pass
your
life
in
such
a
house
as
this
without
society
without
excitement
without
something
to
fill
your
mind
fanny
you
ca
be
happy
here
at
grey
abbey
happy
thought
fanny
to
herself
no
indeed
i
not
happy
she
say
so
however
and
kilcullen
after
a
little
while
went
on
speaking
i
sure
you
ca
be
comfortable
here
you
do
feel
it
i
dare
say
so
intolerable
as
i
do
but
still
you
have
been
out
enough
enough
in
the
world
to
feel
strongly
the
everlasting
of
this
horrid
place
i
wonder
what
possesses
my
father
that
he
does
not
go
to
london
for
your
sake
if
for
no
one
else
it
not
just
of
him
to
coop
you
up
here
indeed
it
is
adolphus
said
she
you
mistake
my
character
i
not
at
all
anxious
for
london
parties
and
gaiety
stupid
as
you
may
think
me
i
quite
as
well
contented
to
stay
here
as
i
should
be
to
go
to
london
do
you
mean
me
to
believe
said
kilcullen
with
a
gentle
laugh
that
you
are
contented
to
live
and
die
in
single
blessedness
at
grey
abbey
that
your
ambition
does
not
soar
higher
than
the
interchange
of
patterns
with
miss
i
did
not
say
so
adolphus
what
is
your
ambition
then
what
kind
and
style
of
life
would
you
choose
to
live
come
fanny
i
wish
i
could
get
you
to
talk
with
me
about
yourself
i
wish
i
could
teach
you
to
believe
how
anxious
i
am
that
your
future
life
should
be
happy
and
contented
and
at
the
same
time
splendid
and
noble
as
it
should
be
i
sure
you
must
have
ambition
i
have
studied
lavater
well
enough
to
know
that
such
a
head
and
face
as
yours
never
belonged
to
a
mind
that
could
satisfy
itself
with
footnote
lavater
johann
kaspar
lavater
swiss
writer
whose
only
widely
read
book
was
a
tract
on
physiognomy
physiognomische
fragmente
zur
beförderung
der
menschenkenntnis
und
menschenliebe
the
victorians
put
much
stock
in
physiognomy
you
are
very
severe
on
the
poor
but
am
i
not
in
the
right
decidedly
not
lavater
and
my
head
and
face
have
misled
you
nonsense
fanny
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
have
no
aspiration
for
a
kind
of
life
different
from
this
you
are
leading
if
so
i
am
much
disappointed
in
you
much
very
much
astray
in
my
judgment
of
your
character
then
he
walked
on
a
few
yards
looking
on
the
ground
and
said
come
fanny
i
am
talking
very
earnestly
to
you
and
you
answer
me
only
in
joke
you
do
think
me
impertinent
do
you
to
talk
about
yourself
impertinent
adolphus
of
course
i
do
why
wo
you
talk
to
me
then
in
the
spirit
in
which
i
am
talking
to
you
if
you
knew
fanny
how
interested
i
am
about
you
how
anxious
that
you
should
be
happy
how
confidently
i
look
forward
to
the
distinguished
position
i
expect
you
to
fill
if
you
could
guess
how
proud
i
mean
to
be
of
you
when
you
are
the
cynosure
of
all
eyes
the
admired
of
all
admirers
admired
not
more
for
your
beauty
than
your
talent
if
i
could
make
you
believe
fanny
how
much
i
expect
from
you
and
how
fully
i
trust
that
my
expectations
will
be
realised
you
would
not
at
any
rate
answer
me
lightly
adolphus
said
fanny
i
thought
there
was
to
be
no
flattering
between
us
and
do
you
think
i
would
flatter
you
do
you
think
i
would
stoop
to
flatter
you
oh
fanny
you
do
understand
me
yet
you
do
at
all
understand
how
thoroughly
from
the
heart
i
speaking
how
much
in
earnest
i
am
and
so
far
from
flattering
you
i
am
quite
as
anxious
to
find
fault
with
you
as
i
am
to
praise
you
could
i
feel
that
i
had
liberty
to
do
so
pray
do
said
fanny
anything
but
flattery
for
a
friend
never
flatters
but
kilcullen
had
intended
to
flatter
his
fair
cousin
and
he
had
been
successful
she
was
gratified
and
pleased
by
his
warmth
of
affection
pray
do
repeated
fanny
i
have
more
faults
than
virtues
to
be
told
of
and
so
i
afraid
you
find
out
when
you
know
me
better
to
begin
then
said
kilcullen
are
you
not
wrong
but
no
fanny
i
will
not
torment
you
now
with
a
catalogue
of
faults
i
did
not
ask
you
to
come
out
with
me
for
that
object
you
are
now
in
grief
for
the
death
of
poor
harry
fanny
blushed
as
she
reflected
how
much
more
poignant
a
sorrow
weighed
upon
her
heart
and
are
therefore
unable
to
exert
yourself
but
as
soon
as
you
are
able
when
you
have
recovered
from
this
severe
blow
i
trust
you
will
not
be
content
to
loiter
and
dawdle
away
your
existence
at
grey
abbey
not
the
whole
of
it
said
fanny
none
of
it
replied
her
cousin
every
month
every
day
should
have
its
purpose
my
father
has
got
into
a
dull
heartless
apathetic
mode
of
life
which
suits
my
mother
and
selina
but
which
will
never
suit
you
grey
abbey
is
like
the
dead
sea
of
which
the
waters
are
always
bitter
as
well
as
stagnant
it
makes
me
miserable
dearest
fanny
to
see
you
stifled
in
such
a
pool
your
beauty
talents
and
energies
your
disposition
to
enjoy
life
and
power
of
making
it
enjoyable
for
others
are
all
thrown
away
oh
fanny
if
i
could
rescue
you
from
this
you
are
inventing
imaginary
evils
said
she
at
any
rate
they
are
not
palpable
to
my
eyes
that
it
that
just
what
i
fear
said
the
other
that
time
habit
and
endurance
may
teach
you
to
think
that
nothing
further
is
to
be
looked
for
in
this
world
than
vegetation
at
grey
abbey
or
some
other
place
of
the
kind
to
which
you
may
be
transplanted
i
want
to
wake
you
from
such
a
torpor
to
save
you
from
such
ignominy
i
wish
to
restore
you
to
the
world
there
time
enough
adolphus
you
see
me
yet
the
gayest
of
the
gay
at
almack
ah
but
to
please
me
fanny
it
must
be
as
one
of
the
leaders
not
one
of
the
led
oh
that
be
in
years
to
come
in
twenty
years
time
when
i
come
forth
glorious
in
a
jewelled
turban
and
yards
upon
yards
of
yellow
satin
fat
fair
and
forty
i
certainly
no
ambition
to
be
one
of
the
leaders
yet
lord
kilcullen
walked
on
silent
for
a
considerable
time
during
which
fanny
went
on
talking
about
london
almack
and
the
miserable
life
of
lady
patronesses
till
at
last
she
also
became
silent
and
began
thinking
of
lord
ballindine
she
had
some
little
time
since
fully
made
up
her
mind
to
open
her
heart
to
lord
kilcullen
about
him
and
she
had
as
fully
determined
not
to
do
so
after
what
selina
had
said
upon
the
subject
but
now
she
again
wavered
his
manner
was
so
kind
and
affectionate
his
interest
in
her
future
happiness
appeared
to
be
so
true
and
unaffected
at
any
rate
he
would
not
speak
harshly
or
cruelly
to
her
if
she
convinced
him
how
completely
her
happiness
depended
on
her
being
reconciled
to
lord
ballindine
she
had
all
but
brought
herself
to
the
point
she
had
almost
determined
to
tell
him
everything
when
he
stopped
rather
abruptly
and
said
i
also
am
leaving
grey
abbey
again
fanny
leaving
grey
abbey
said
fanny
you
told
me
the
other
day
you
were
going
to
live
here
so
i
intended
so
i
do
intend
but
still
i
must
leave
it
for
a
while
i
going
about
business
and
i
do
know
how
long
i
may
be
away
i
go
on
saturday
i
hope
adolphus
you
have
quarrelled
with
your
father
said
she
oh
no
said
he
it
is
on
his
advice
that
i
am
going
i
believe
there
is
no
fear
of
our
quarrelling
now
i
should
rather
say
i
trust
there
is
none
he
not
only
approves
of
my
going
but
approves
of
what
i
am
about
to
do
before
i
go
and
what
is
that
i
had
not
intended
fanny
to
say
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
for
some
time
for
i
feel
that
different
circumstances
make
it
premature
but
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
leave
you
without
doing
so
and
again
he
paused
and
walked
on
a
little
way
in
silence
and
yet
he
continued
i
hardly
know
how
to
utter
what
i
wish
to
say
or
rather
what
i
would
wish
to
have
said
were
it
not
that
i
dread
so
much
the
answer
you
may
make
me
stop
fanny
stop
a
moment
the
seat
is
quite
dry
sit
down
one
moment
fanny
sat
down
in
a
little
alcove
which
they
had
reached
considerably
embarrassed
and
surprised
she
had
not
however
the
most
remote
idea
of
what
he
was
about
to
say
to
her
had
any
other
man
in
the
world
almost
spoken
to
her
in
the
same
language
she
would
have
expected
an
offer
but
from
the
way
in
which
she
had
always
regarded
her
cousin
both
heretofore
when
she
hardly
knew
him
and
now
when
she
was
on
such
affectionate
terms
with
him
she
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
receiving
an
offer
from
lord
cashel
as
from
his
son
fanny
he
said
i
told
you
before
that
i
have
my
father
warmest
and
most
entire
approval
for
what
i
am
now
going
to
do
should
i
be
successful
in
what
i
ask
he
will
be
delighted
but
i
have
no
words
to
tell
you
what
my
own
feelings
will
be
fanny
dearest
fanny
and
he
sat
down
close
beside
her
i
love
you
better
ah
how
much
better
than
all
the
world
holds
beside
dearest
dearest
fanny
will
you
can
you
return
my
love
adolphus
said
fanny
rising
suddenly
from
her
seat
more
for
the
sake
of
turning
round
so
as
to
look
at
him
than
with
the
object
of
getting
from
him
adolphus
you
are
joking
with
me
no
by
heavens
then
said
he
following
her
and
catching
her
hand
no
man
in
ireland
is
this
moment
more
in
earnest
no
man
more
anxiously
painfully
in
earnest
oh
fanny
why
should
you
suppose
that
i
am
not
so
how
can
you
think
i
would
joke
on
such
a
subject
no
hear
me
he
said
interrupting
her
as
she
prepared
to
answer
him
hear
me
out
and
then
you
will
know
how
truly
i
am
in
earnest
no
not
a
word
further
almost
shrieked
fanny
not
a
word
more
adolphus
not
a
syllable
at
any
rate
till
you
have
heard
me
oh
you
have
made
me
so
miserable
and
fanny
burst
into
tears
i
have
spoken
too
suddenly
to
you
fanny
i
should
have
given
you
more
time
i
should
have
waited
till
no
no
no
said
fanny
it
is
not
that
but
yes
what
you
say
is
true
had
you
waited
but
one
hour
but
ten
minutes
i
should
have
told
you
that
which
would
for
ever
have
prevented
all
this
i
should
have
told
you
adolphus
how
dearly
how
unutterably
i
love
another
and
fanny
again
sat
down
hid
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
against
the
corner
of
the
and
sobbed
and
cried
as
though
she
were
during
which
time
kilcullen
stood
by
rather
perplexed
as
to
what
he
was
to
say
next
and
beginning
to
be
very
doubtful
as
to
his
ultimate
success
dear
fanny
he
said
for
both
our
sakes
pray
try
to
be
collected
all
my
future
happiness
is
at
this
moment
at
stake
i
did
not
bring
you
here
to
listen
to
what
i
have
told
you
without
having
become
too
painfully
sure
that
your
hand
your
heart
your
love
are
necessary
to
my
happiness
all
my
hopes
are
now
at
stake
but
i
would
not
if
i
could
secure
my
own
happiness
at
the
expense
of
yours
pray
believe
me
fanny
when
i
say
that
i
love
you
completely
unalterably
devotedly
it
is
necessary
now
for
my
own
sake
that
i
should
say
as
much
as
that
having
told
you
so
much
of
my
own
heart
let
me
hear
what
you
wish
to
tell
me
of
yours
oh
that
i
might
have
the
most
distant
gleam
of
hope
that
it
would
ever
return
the
love
which
fills
my
own
it
can
not
adolphus
it
never
can
said
she
still
trying
to
hide
her
tears
oh
why
should
this
bitter
misery
have
been
added
she
then
rose
quickly
from
her
seat
wiped
her
eyes
and
pushing
back
her
hair
continued
i
will
no
longer
continue
to
live
such
a
life
as
i
have
done
miserable
to
myself
and
the
cause
of
misery
to
others
adolphus
i
love
lord
ballindine
i
love
him
with
i
believe
as
true
and
devoted
a
love
as
woman
ever
felt
for
a
man
i
valued
appreciated
gloried
in
your
friendship
but
i
can
never
return
your
love
my
heart
is
wholly
utterly
given
away
and
i
would
not
for
worlds
receive
it
back
till
i
learn
from
his
own
mouth
that
he
has
ceased
to
love
me
oh
fanny
my
poor
fanny
said
kilcullen
if
such
is
the
case
you
are
really
to
be
pitied
if
this
be
true
your
condition
is
nearly
as
unhappy
as
my
own
i
am
unhappy
very
unhappy
in
your
love
said
fanny
drawing
herself
up
proudly
but
not
unhappy
in
my
own
my
misery
is
that
i
should
be
the
cause
of
trouble
and
unhappiness
to
others
i
have
nothing
to
regret
in
my
own
choice
you
are
harsh
fanny
it
may
be
well
that
you
should
be
decided
but
it
can
not
become
you
also
to
be
unfeeling
i
have
offered
to
you
all
that
a
man
can
offer
my
name
my
fortune
my
life
my
heart
though
you
may
refuse
me
you
have
no
right
to
be
offended
with
me
oh
adolphus
said
she
now
in
her
turn
offering
him
her
hand
pray
forgive
me
pray
do
not
be
angry
heaven
knows
i
feel
no
offence
and
how
strongly
how
sincerely
i
feel
the
compliment
you
have
offered
me
but
i
want
you
to
see
how
vain
it
would
be
in
me
to
leave
you
leave
you
in
any
doubt
i
only
spoke
as
i
did
to
show
you
i
could
not
think
twice
when
my
heart
was
given
to
one
whom
i
so
entirely
love
respect
and
and
approve
lord
kilcullen
face
became
thoughtful
and
his
brow
grew
black
he
stood
for
some
time
irresolute
what
to
say
or
do
let
us
walk
on
fanny
for
this
is
cold
and
damp
he
said
at
last
let
us
go
back
to
the
house
then
as
you
like
fanny
oh
how
painful
all
this
is
how
doubly
painful
to
know
that
ray
own
love
is
hopeless
and
that
yours
is
no
less
so
did
you
not
refuse
lord
ballindine
if
i
did
is
it
not
sufficient
that
i
tell
you
i
love
him
if
he
were
gone
past
all
redemption
you
would
not
have
me
encourage
you
while
i
love
another
i
never
dreamed
of
this
what
fanny
what
are
your
hopes
what
is
it
you
wish
or
intend
supposing
me
as
i
wish
i
were
fathoms
deep
below
the
earth
what
would
you
do
you
can
not
marry
lord
ballindine
then
i
will
marry
no
one
said
fanny
striving
hard
to
suppress
her
tears
and
barely
succeeding
good
heavens
exclaimed
kilcullen
what
an
infatuation
is
this
and
then
again
he
walked
on
silent
a
little
way
have
you
told
any
one
of
this
fanny
do
they
know
of
it
at
grey
abbey
come
fanny
speak
to
me
forget
if
you
will
that
i
would
be
your
lover
remember
me
only
as
your
cousin
and
your
friend
and
speak
to
me
openly
do
they
know
that
you
have
repented
of
the
refusal
you
gave
lord
ballindine
they
all
know
that
i
love
him
your
father
your
mother
and
selina
you
do
say
my
father
yes
said
fanny
stopping
on
the
path
and
speaking
with
energy
as
she
confronted
her
cousin
yes
lord
cashel
he
above
all
others
knows
it
i
have
told
him
so
almost
on
my
knees
i
have
implored
him
as
a
child
may
implore
her
father
to
bring
back
to
me
the
only
man
i
ever
loved
i
have
besought
him
not
to
sacrifice
me
oh
how
i
have
implored
him
to
spare
me
the
dreadful
punishment
of
my
own
folly
wretchedness
rather
in
rejecting
the
man
i
loved
but
he
has
not
listened
to
me
he
will
never
listen
to
me
and
i
will
never
ask
again
he
shall
find
that
i
am
not
a
tree
or
a
stone
to
be
planted
or
placed
as
he
chooses
i
will
not
again
be
subjected
to
what
i
have
suffered
i
will
not
i
will
not
but
fanny
was
out
of
breath
and
could
not
complete
the
catalogue
of
what
she
would
not
do
and
did
you
intend
to
tell
me
all
this
had
i
not
spoken
to
you
as
i
have
done
said
kilcullen
i
did
said
she
i
was
on
the
point
of
telling
you
everything
twice
i
had
intended
to
do
so
i
intended
to
implore
you
as
you
loved
me
as
your
cousin
to
use
your
exertions
to
reconcile
my
uncle
and
lord
ballindine
and
now
instead
of
that
you
find
i
love
you
too
well
myself
oh
forget
adolphus
forget
that
the
words
ever
passed
your
lips
you
have
not
loved
me
long
and
therefore
will
not
continue
to
love
me
when
you
know
i
never
can
be
yours
forget
your
love
wo
you
adolphus
and
she
put
her
clasped
hands
upon
his
breast
forget
let
us
both
forget
that
the
words
were
ever
spoken
be
still
my
cousin
my
friend
my
brother
and
we
shall
still
both
be
happy
different
feelings
were
disturbing
lord
kilcullen
breast
different
from
each
other
and
some
of
them
very
different
from
those
which
usually
found
a
place
there
he
had
sought
fanny
hand
not
only
with
most
sordid
but
also
with
most
dishonest
views
he
not
only
intended
to
marry
her
for
her
fortune
but
also
to
rob
her
of
her
money
to
defraud
her
that
he
might
enable
himself
once
more
to
enter
the
world
of
pleasure
with
the
slight
encumbrance
of
a
wretched
wife
but
in
carrying
out
his
plan
he
had
disturbed
it
by
his
own
weakness
he
had
absolutely
allowed
himself
to
fall
in
love
with
his
cousin
and
when
as
he
had
just
done
he
offered
her
his
hand
he
was
quite
as
anxious
that
she
should
accept
him
for
her
own
sake
as
for
that
of
her
money
he
had
taught
himself
to
believe
that
she
would
accept
him
and
many
misgivings
had
haunted
him
as
to
the
ruined
state
to
which
he
should
bring
her
as
his
wife
but
these
feelings
though
strong
enough
to
disturb
him
were
not
strong
enough
to
make
him
pause
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
he
could
yet
make
her
happy
and
hurried
on
to
the
consummation
of
his
hopes
he
now
felt
strongly
tempted
to
act
a
generous
part
to
give
her
up
and
to
bring
lord
ballindine
back
to
her
feet
to
deserve
at
any
rate
well
of
her
and
leave
all
other
things
to
chance
but
lord
kilcullen
was
not
accustomed
to
make
such
sacrifices
he
had
never
learned
to
disregard
himself
and
again
and
again
he
turned
it
over
in
his
mind
how
could
he
get
her
fortune
was
there
any
way
left
in
which
he
might
be
successful
this
is
child
play
fanny
he
said
you
may
reject
me
to
that
i
have
nothing
further
to
say
for
i
am
but
an
indifferent
wooer
but
you
can
never
marry
lord
ballindine
oh
adolphus
for
mercy
sake
do
say
so
but
i
do
say
so
fanny
god
knows
not
to
wound
you
or
for
any
unworthy
purpose
but
because
it
is
so
he
was
your
lover
and
you
sent
him
away
you
can
not
whistle
him
back
as
you
would
a
dog
fanny
made
no
answer
to
this
but
walked
on
towards
the
house
anxious
to
find
herself
alone
in
her
own
room
that
she
might
compose
her
mind
and
think
over
all
that
she
had
heard
and
said
nor
did
lord
kilcullen
renew
the
conversation
till
he
got
to
the
house
he
could
not
determine
what
to
do
under
other
circumstances
it
might
he
felt
have
been
wise
for
him
to
wait
till
time
had
weakened
fanny
regret
for
her
lost
lover
but
in
his
case
this
was
impracticable
if
he
waited
anywhere
it
would
be
in
the
queen
bench
and
yet
he
could
not
but
feel
that
at
present
it
was
hopeless
for
him
to
push
his
suit
they
reached
the
steps
together
and
as
he
opened
the
front
door
fanny
turned
round
to
wish
him
good
morning
as
she
was
hurrying
in
but
he
stopped
her
and
said
one
word
more
fanny
before
we
part
you
must
not
refuse
me
nor
must
we
part
in
this
way
step
in
here
i
will
not
keep
you
a
minute
and
he
took
her
into
a
room
off
the
hall
do
not
let
us
be
children
fanny
do
not
let
us
deceive
each
other
or
ourselves
do
not
let
us
persist
in
being
irrational
if
we
ourselves
see
that
we
are
so
and
he
paused
for
a
reply
well
adolphus
was
all
she
said
if
i
could
avoid
it
continued
he
i
would
not
hurt
your
feelings
but
you
must
see
you
must
know
that
you
can
not
marry
lord
ballindine
fanny
who
was
now
sitting
bit
her
lips
and
clenched
her
hands
but
she
said
nothing
if
this
is
so
if
you
feel
that
so
far
your
fate
is
fixed
are
you
mad
enough
to
give
yourself
up
to
a
vain
and
wicked
passion
for
wicked
it
will
be
will
you
not
rather
strive
to
forget
him
who
has
forgotten
you
that
is
not
true
interposed
fanny
his
conduct
unfortunately
proves
that
it
is
too
true
continued
kilcullen
he
has
forgotten
you
and
you
can
not
blame
him
that
he
should
do
so
now
that
you
have
rejected
him
but
he
neglected
you
even
before
you
did
so
is
it
wise
is
it
decorous
is
it
maidenly
in
you
to
indulge
any
longer
in
so
vain
a
passion
think
of
this
fanny
as
to
myself
heaven
knows
with
what
perfect
truth
with
what
true
love
i
offered
you
this
morning
all
that
a
man
can
offer
how
ardently
i
hoped
for
an
answer
different
from
that
you
have
now
given
me
you
can
not
give
me
your
heart
now
love
can
not
at
a
moment
be
transferred
but
think
fanny
think
whether
it
is
not
better
for
you
to
accept
an
offer
which
your
friends
will
all
approve
and
which
i
trust
will
never
make
you
unhappy
than
to
give
yourself
up
to
a
lasting
regret
to
tears
misery
and
grief
and
would
you
take
my
hand
without
my
heart
said
she
not
for
worlds
replied
the
other
were
i
not
certain
that
your
heart
would
follow
your
hand
whoever
may
be
your
husband
you
will
love
him
but
ask
my
mother
talk
to
her
ask
her
advice
she
at
any
rate
will
only
tell
you
that
which
must
be
best
for
your
own
happiness
go
to
her
fanny
if
her
advice
be
different
from
mine
i
will
not
say
a
word
farther
to
urge
my
suit
i
will
go
to
no
one
said
fanny
rising
i
have
gone
to
too
many
with
a
piteous
story
on
my
lips
i
have
no
friend
now
in
this
house
i
had
still
hoped
to
find
one
in
you
but
that
hope
is
over
i
am
of
course
proud
of
the
honour
your
declaration
has
conveyed
but
i
should
be
wicked
indeed
if
i
did
not
make
you
perfectly
understand
that
it
is
one
which
i
can
not
accept
whatever
may
be
your
views
your
ideas
i
will
never
marry
unless
i
thoroughly
love
and
feel
that
i
am
thoroughly
loved
by
my
future
husband
had
you
not
made
this
declaration
had
you
not
even
persisted
in
repeating
it
after
i
had
opened
my
whole
heart
to
you
i
could
have
loved
and
cherished
you
as
a
brother
under
no
circumstances
could
i
ever
have
accepted
you
as
a
husband
good
morning
and
she
left
him
alone
feeling
that
he
could
have
but
little
chance
of
success
should
he
again
renew
the
attempt
he
did
not
see
her
again
till
when
she
appeared
silent
and
reserved
but
still
collected
and
at
her
ease
nor
did
he
speak
to
her
at
dinner
or
during
the
evening
till
the
moment
the
ladies
were
retiring
for
the
night
he
then
came
up
to
her
as
she
was
standing
alone
turning
over
some
things
on
a
and
said
fanny
i
probably
leave
grey
abbey
i
will
say
good
bye
to
you
tonight
good
bye
adolphus
may
we
both
be
happier
when
next
we
meet
said
she
my
happiness
i
fear
is
doubtful
but
i
will
not
speak
of
that
now
if
i
can
do
anything
for
yours
before
i
go
i
will
fanny
i
will
ask
my
father
to
invite
lord
ballindine
here
he
has
been
anxious
that
we
should
be
married
when
i
tell
him
that
that
is
impossible
he
may
perhaps
be
induced
to
do
so
do
that
said
fanny
and
you
will
be
a
friend
to
me
do
that
and
you
will
be
more
than
a
brother
to
me
i
will
and
in
doing
so
i
shall
crush
every
hope
that
i
have
had
left
in
me
do
not
say
so
adolphus
do
not
you
understand
what
i
mean
in
a
short
time
i
can
not
explain
everything
to
you
now
but
this
will
i
do
i
will
make
lord
cashel
understand
that
we
never
can
be
more
to
each
other
than
we
are
now
and
i
will
advise
him
to
seek
a
reconciliation
with
lord
ballindine
and
now
good
bye
and
he
held
out
his
hand
but
i
shall
see
you
probably
not
and
if
you
do
it
will
be
but
for
a
moment
when
i
shall
have
other
adieux
to
make
good
bye
then
adolphus
and
may
god
bless
you
and
may
we
yet
live
to
have
many
happy
days
together
and
she
shook
hands
with
him
and
went
to
her
room
xxxiii
lord
kilcullen
makes
another
visit
to
the
lord
cashel
plans
were
certainly
not
lucky
it
was
not
that
sufficient
care
was
not
used
in
laying
them
nor
sufficient
caution
displayed
in
maturing
them
he
passed
his
time
in
care
and
caution
he
spared
no
pains
in
seeing
that
the
whole
machinery
was
right
he
was
indefatigable
in
deliberation
diligent
in
manoeuvring
constant
in
attention
but
somehow
he
was
unlucky
his
schemes
were
never
successful
in
the
present
instance
he
was
peculiarly
unfortunate
for
everything
went
wrong
with
him
he
had
got
rid
of
an
obnoxious
lover
he
had
coaxed
over
his
son
he
had
spent
an
immensity
of
money
he
had
undergone
worlds
of
trouble
and
and
then
when
he
really
began
to
think
that
his
ward
fortune
would
compensate
him
for
this
his
own
family
came
to
him
one
after
another
to
assure
him
that
he
was
completely
mistaken
that
it
was
utterly
impossible
that
such
a
thing
as
a
family
marriage
between
the
two
cousins
could
never
take
place
and
indeed
ought
not
to
be
thought
of
lady
selina
gave
him
the
first
check
on
the
morning
on
which
lord
kilcullen
made
his
offer
she
paid
her
father
a
solemn
visit
in
his
and
told
him
exactly
what
she
had
before
told
her
mother
assured
him
that
fanny
could
not
be
induced
at
any
rate
at
present
to
receive
her
cousin
as
her
lover
whispered
to
him
with
unfeigned
sorrow
and
shame
that
fanny
was
still
madly
in
love
with
lord
ballindine
and
begged
him
to
induce
her
brother
to
postpone
his
offer
at
any
rate
for
some
months
i
hate
lord
ballindine
very
name
said
the
earl
petulant
with
irritation
we
none
of
us
approve
of
him
papa
we
do
think
of
supposing
that
he
could
now
be
a
fitting
husband
for
fanny
or
that
they
could
possibly
ever
be
married
of
course
it
not
to
be
thought
of
but
if
you
would
advise
adolphus
not
to
be
premature
he
might
in
the
end
be
more
successful
kilcullen
has
made
his
own
bed
and
he
must
lie
in
it
i
interfere
between
them
said
the
angry
father
but
if
you
were
only
to
recommend
delay
suggested
the
daughter
a
few
months
delay
think
how
short
a
time
harry
wyndham
has
been
dead
lord
cashel
knew
that
delay
was
death
in
this
case
so
he
pished
and
hummed
and
hawed
quite
lost
the
dignity
on
which
he
piqued
himself
and
ended
by
declaring
that
he
would
not
interfere
that
they
might
do
as
they
liked
that
young
people
would
not
be
guided
and
that
he
would
not
make
himself
unhappy
about
them
and
so
lady
selina
crestfallen
and
disappointed
went
away
then
lady
cashel
reflecting
on
what
her
daughter
had
told
her
and
yet
anxious
that
the
marriage
should
if
possible
take
place
at
some
time
or
other
sent
griffiths
down
to
her
lord
with
a
message
would
his
lordship
be
kind
enough
to
step
to
her
ladyship
lord
cashel
went
up
and
again
had
all
the
difficulties
of
the
case
opened
out
before
him
but
you
see
said
her
ladyship
poor
fanny
she
become
so
unreasonable
i
do
know
what
come
to
her
i
sure
i
do
everything
i
can
to
make
her
happy
but
i
suppose
if
she
do
like
to
marry
nobody
can
make
her
make
her
who
talking
of
making
her
said
the
earl
no
of
course
not
continued
the
countess
that
just
what
selina
says
no
one
can
make
her
do
anything
she
got
so
obstinate
of
late
but
it
all
that
horrid
lord
ballindine
and
those
odious
horses
sure
i
do
know
what
business
gentlemen
have
to
have
horses
at
all
there
never
any
good
comes
of
it
there
adolphus
he
had
the
good
sense
to
get
rid
of
his
and
yet
fanny
so
foolish
she
sooner
have
that
other
horrid
man
and
i
sure
he
not
half
so
nor
a
quarter
so
agreeable
as
adolphus
all
these
encomiums
on
his
son
and
animadversions
on
lord
ballindine
were
not
calculated
to
put
the
earl
into
a
good
humour
he
was
heartily
sick
of
the
subject
thoroughly
repented
that
he
had
not
allowed
his
son
to
ruin
himself
in
his
own
way
detested
the
very
name
of
lord
ballindine
and
felt
no
very
strong
affection
for
his
poor
innocent
ward
he
accordingly
made
his
wife
nearly
the
same
answer
he
had
made
his
daughter
and
left
her
anything
but
comforted
by
the
visit
it
was
about
eleven
on
the
same
evening
that
lord
kilcullen
after
parting
with
fanny
opened
the
door
he
had
been
quite
sincere
in
what
he
had
told
her
he
had
made
up
his
mind
entirely
to
give
over
all
hopes
of
marrying
her
himself
and
to
tell
his
father
that
the
field
was
again
open
for
lord
ballindine
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
would
not
have
been
noble
enough
to
do
this
had
he
thought
he
had
himself
any
chance
of
being
successful
but
still
there
was
something
chivalrous
in
his
resolve
something
magnanimous
in
his
determination
to
do
all
he
could
for
the
happiness
of
her
he
really
loved
when
everything
in
his
own
prospects
was
gloomy
dark
and
desperate
as
he
entered
his
father
room
feeling
that
it
would
probably
be
very
long
before
he
should
be
closeted
with
him
again
he
determined
that
he
would
not
quietly
bear
reproaches
and
even
felt
a
source
of
satisfaction
in
the
prospect
of
telling
his
father
that
their
joint
plans
were
overturned
their
schemes
completely
at
an
end
i
disturbing
you
my
lord
i
afraid
said
the
son
walking
into
the
room
not
at
all
with
the
manner
of
one
who
had
any
hesitation
at
causing
the
disturbance
who
that
said
the
earl
adolphus
no
yes
that
is
i
just
going
to
bed
what
is
it
you
want
the
earl
had
been
dozing
after
all
the
vexations
of
the
day
to
tell
the
truth
my
lord
i
a
good
deal
that
i
wish
to
say
will
it
trouble
you
to
listen
to
me
wo
morning
do
i
shall
leave
grey
abbey
early
my
lord
immediately
after
breakfast
good
heavens
kilcullen
what
do
you
mean
you
not
going
to
run
off
to
london
again
a
little
farther
than
that
i
afraid
will
be
necessary
said
the
son
i
have
offered
to
miss
wyndham
have
been
refused
and
having
finished
my
business
at
grey
abbey
your
lordship
will
probably
think
that
in
leaving
it
i
shall
be
acting
with
discretion
you
have
offered
to
fanny
and
been
refused
indeed
i
have
finally
and
peremptorily
refused
not
only
that
i
have
pledged
my
word
to
my
cousin
that
i
will
never
renew
my
suit
the
earl
sat
speechless
in
his
chair
so
much
worse
was
this
catastrophe
even
than
his
expectations
lord
kilcullen
continued
i
hope
at
any
rate
you
are
satisfied
with
me
i
have
not
only
implicitly
obeyed
your
directions
but
i
have
done
everything
in
my
power
to
accomplish
what
you
wished
had
my
marriage
with
my
cousin
been
a
project
of
my
own
i
could
not
have
done
more
for
its
accomplishment
miss
wyndham
affections
are
engaged
and
she
will
never
i
am
sure
marry
one
man
while
she
loves
another
loves
another
psha
roared
the
earl
is
this
to
be
the
end
of
it
all
after
your
promises
to
me
after
your
engagement
after
such
an
engagement
sir
you
come
to
me
and
talk
about
a
girl
loving
another
loving
another
will
her
loving
another
pay
your
debts
exactly
the
reverse
my
lord
said
the
son
i
fear
it
will
materially
postpone
their
payment
well
sir
said
the
earl
he
did
not
exactly
know
how
to
commence
the
thunder
of
indignation
with
which
he
intended
to
annihilate
his
son
for
certainly
kilcullen
had
done
the
best
in
his
power
to
complete
the
bargain
but
still
the
storm
could
not
be
stayed
unreasonable
as
it
might
be
for
the
earl
to
be
tempestuous
on
the
occasion
well
sir
and
he
stood
up
from
his
chair
to
face
his
victim
who
was
still
standing
and
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
trowsers
pockets
frowned
awfully
well
sir
am
i
to
be
any
further
favoured
with
your
plans
i
have
none
my
lord
said
kilcullen
i
am
again
ready
to
listen
to
yours
my
plans
i
have
no
further
plans
to
offer
for
you
you
are
ruined
utterly
ruined
you
have
done
your
best
to
ruin
me
and
your
mother
i
have
pointed
out
to
you
i
arranged
for
you
the
only
way
in
which
your
affairs
could
be
redeemed
i
made
every
thing
easy
for
you
no
my
lord
you
could
not
make
it
easy
for
me
to
get
my
love
do
contradict
me
sir
i
say
i
did
i
made
every
thing
straight
and
easy
for
you
and
now
you
come
to
me
with
a
whining
story
about
a
girl
love
what
her
love
to
me
sir
where
am
i
to
get
my
thirty
thousand
pounds
sir
and
my
note
of
hand
is
passed
for
as
much
more
at
this
time
where
am
i
to
raise
that
sir
do
you
remember
that
you
have
engaged
to
repay
me
these
sums
do
you
remember
that
or
have
such
trifles
escaped
your
recollection
i
remember
perfectly
well
my
lord
that
if
i
married
my
cousin
you
were
to
repay
yourself
those
sums
out
of
her
fortune
but
i
also
remember
and
so
must
you
that
i
beforehand
warned
you
that
i
thought
she
would
refuse
me
refuse
you
said
the
earl
with
a
contortion
of
his
nose
and
lips
intended
to
convey
unutterable
scorn
of
course
she
refused
you
when
you
asked
her
as
a
child
would
ask
for
an
apple
or
a
cake
what
else
could
you
expect
i
hardly
think
your
lordship
knows
do
you
hardly
think
then
i
do
know
and
know
well
too
i
know
you
have
deceived
me
grossly
deceived
me
induced
me
to
give
you
money
to
incur
debts
with
which
i
never
would
have
burdened
myself
had
i
not
believed
you
were
sincere
in
your
promise
but
you
have
deceived
me
sir
taken
me
in
for
by
heaven
it
no
better
it
no
better
than
downright
swindling
and
that
from
a
son
to
his
father
but
it
for
the
last
time
not
a
penny
more
do
you
get
from
me
you
can
ruin
the
property
indeed
i
believe
you
have
but
for
your
mother
and
sister
sake
i
keep
till
i
die
what
little
you
have
left
me
lord
cashel
had
worked
himself
up
into
a
perfect
frenzy
and
was
stamping
about
the
room
as
he
uttered
this
speech
but
as
he
came
to
the
end
of
it
he
threw
himself
into
his
chair
again
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
lord
kilcullen
was
standing
with
his
back
resting
against
the
with
a
look
of
feigned
indifference
on
his
face
which
he
tried
hard
to
maintain
but
his
brow
became
clouded
and
he
bit
his
lips
when
his
father
accused
him
of
swindling
and
he
was
just
about
to
break
forth
into
a
torrent
of
recrimination
when
lord
cashel
turned
off
into
a
pathetic
strain
and
kilcullen
thought
it
better
to
leave
him
there
what
i
to
do
i
do
know
what
i
am
to
do
i
do
not
know
said
the
earl
beating
the
table
with
one
hand
and
hiding
his
face
with
the
other
sixty
thousand
pounds
in
one
year
and
that
after
so
many
drains
and
there
only
my
own
life
there
only
my
own
life
and
then
there
was
a
pause
for
four
or
five
minutes
during
which
lord
kilcullen
took
snuff
poked
the
fire
and
then
picked
up
a
newspaper
as
though
he
were
going
to
read
it
this
last
was
too
much
for
the
father
and
he
again
roared
out
well
sir
what
are
you
standing
there
for
if
you
nothing
else
to
say
why
do
you
go
i
done
with
you
you
can
not
get
more
out
of
me
i
promise
you
i
a
good
deal
to
say
before
i
go
my
lord
said
kilcullen
i
was
waiting
till
you
were
disposed
to
listen
to
me
i
a
good
deal
to
say
indeed
which
you
must
hear
and
i
trust
therefore
you
will
endeavour
to
be
cool
whatever
your
opinions
may
be
about
my
conduct
cool
no
sir
i
will
not
be
cool
you
too
cool
yourself
cool
enough
for
both
you
think
my
lord
kilcullen
said
the
earl
you
neither
heart
nor
principle
you
have
done
your
worst
to
ruin
me
and
now
you
come
to
insult
me
in
my
own
room
say
what
you
want
to
say
and
then
leave
me
as
to
insulting
language
my
lord
i
think
you
need
not
complain
when
you
remember
that
you
have
just
called
me
a
swindler
because
i
have
been
unable
to
accomplish
your
wish
and
my
own
by
marrying
my
cousin
however
i
will
let
that
pass
i
have
done
the
best
i
could
to
gain
that
object
i
did
more
than
either
of
us
thought
it
possible
that
i
should
do
when
i
consented
to
attempt
it
i
offered
her
my
hand
and
assured
her
of
my
affection
without
falsehood
or
hypocrisy
my
bargain
was
that
i
should
offer
to
her
i
have
done
more
than
that
for
i
have
loved
her
i
have
however
been
refused
and
in
such
a
manner
as
to
convince
me
that
it
would
be
useless
for
me
to
renew
my
suit
if
your
lordship
will
allow
me
to
advise
you
on
such
a
subject
i
would
suggest
that
you
make
no
further
objection
to
fanny
union
with
lord
ballindine
for
marry
him
she
certainly
will
what
sir
again
shouted
lord
cashel
i
trust
fanny
will
receive
no
further
annoyance
on
the
subject
she
has
convinced
me
that
her
own
mind
is
thoroughly
made
up
and
she
is
not
the
person
to
change
her
mind
on
such
a
subject
and
have
you
enough
on
hand
in
your
own
troubles
but
what
you
must
lecture
me
about
my
ward
is
it
for
that
you
have
come
to
torment
me
at
this
hour
had
not
you
better
at
once
become
her
guardian
yourself
sir
and
manage
the
matter
in
your
own
way
i
promised
fanny
i
would
say
as
much
to
you
i
will
not
again
mention
her
name
unless
you
press
me
to
do
so
that
very
kind
said
the
earl
and
now
about
myself
i
think
your
lordship
will
agree
with
me
that
it
is
better
that
i
should
at
once
leave
grey
abbey
when
i
tell
you
that
if
i
remain
here
i
shall
certainly
be
arrested
before
the
week
is
over
if
i
am
found
outside
the
house
i
do
not
wish
to
have
bailiffs
knocking
at
your
lordship
door
and
your
servants
instructed
to
deny
me
upon
my
soul
you
are
too
good
at
any
rate
said
kilcullen
you
agree
with
me
that
this
is
no
place
for
me
to
remain
in
you
quite
at
liberty
to
go
said
the
earl
you
were
never
very
ceremonious
with
regard
to
me
pray
do
begin
to
be
so
now
pray
go
if
you
like
your
mother
heart
will
be
broken
all
i
trust
my
mother
will
be
able
to
copy
your
lordship
indifference
indifference
is
sixty
thousand
pounds
in
one
year
and
more
than
double
within
three
or
four
indifference
i
have
paid
too
much
to
be
indifferent
but
it
is
hopeless
to
pay
more
i
have
no
hope
for
you
you
are
ruined
and
i
could
redeem
you
even
if
i
would
i
could
not
set
you
free
and
tell
you
to
begin
again
even
were
it
wise
to
do
so
and
therefore
i
tell
you
to
go
and
now
good
night
i
have
not
another
word
to
say
to
you
and
the
earl
got
up
as
if
to
leave
the
room
stop
my
lord
you
must
listen
to
me
said
kilcullen
not
a
word
further
i
have
heard
enough
and
he
put
out
the
candles
on
the
table
having
lighted
a
bed
candle
which
he
held
in
his
hand
pardon
me
my
lord
continued
the
son
standing
just
before
his
father
so
as
to
prevent
his
leaving
the
room
pardon
me
but
you
must
listen
to
what
i
have
to
say
not
another
word
not
another
word
leave
the
door
sir
or
i
will
ring
for
the
servants
to
open
it
do
so
said
kilcullen
and
they
also
shall
hear
what
i
have
to
say
i
am
going
to
leave
you
perhaps
for
ever
and
you
will
not
listen
to
the
last
word
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
i
stay
five
minutes
said
the
earl
taking
out
his
watch
and
then
i
go
and
if
you
attempt
again
to
stop
me
i
ring
the
bell
for
the
servants
thank
you
my
lord
for
the
five
minutes
it
will
be
time
enough
i
purpose
leaving
grey
abbey
and
i
shall
probably
be
in
france
in
three
days
time
when
there
i
trust
i
shall
cease
to
trouble
you
but
i
can
not
indeed
i
will
not
go
without
funds
to
last
me
till
i
can
make
some
arrangement
your
lordship
must
give
me
five
hundred
pounds
i
have
not
the
means
even
of
carrying
myself
from
hence
to
calais
not
one
penny
not
one
penny
if
it
were
to
save
you
from
the
gaol
this
is
too
bad
and
the
earl
again
walked
to
the
door
against
which
lord
kilcullen
leaned
his
back
by
heaven
sir
raise
the
house
if
you
think
to
frighten
me
by
violence
i
use
no
violence
but
you
must
hear
the
alternative
if
you
please
it
the
whole
house
shall
hear
it
too
if
you
persist
in
refusing
the
small
sum
i
now
ask
i
will
not
give
you
one
penny
to
save
you
from
gaol
is
that
plain
perfectly
plain
and
very
easy
to
believe
but
you
will
give
more
than
a
penny
you
would
even
give
more
than
i
ask
to
save
yourself
from
the
annoyance
you
will
have
to
undergo
not
on
any
account
will
i
give
you
one
single
farthing
very
well
then
i
have
only
to
tell
you
what
i
must
do
of
course
i
shall
remain
here
you
can
not
turn
me
out
of
your
house
or
refuse
me
a
seat
at
your
table
by
heavens
though
i
both
can
and
will
you
can
not
my
lord
if
you
think
of
it
you
find
you
can
not
without
much
disagreeable
trouble
an
eldest
son
would
be
a
very
difficult
tenant
to
eject
summarily
and
of
my
own
accord
i
will
not
go
without
the
money
i
ask
by
heavens
this
exceeds
all
i
ever
heard
would
you
rob
your
own
father
i
will
not
rob
him
but
i
remain
in
his
house
the
officers
doubtless
will
hang
about
the
doors
and
be
rather
troublesome
before
the
windows
but
i
shall
not
be
the
first
irish
gentleman
that
has
remained
at
home
upon
his
keeping
and
like
other
irish
gentlemen
i
will
do
so
rather
than
fall
into
the
hands
of
these
myrmidons
i
have
no
wish
to
annoy
you
i
shall
be
most
sorry
to
do
so
most
sorry
to
subject
my
mother
to
the
misery
which
must
attend
the
continual
attempts
which
will
be
made
to
arrest
me
but
i
will
not
put
my
head
into
the
lion
jaw
this
is
the
return
for
what
i
have
done
for
him
ejaculated
the
earl
in
his
misery
unfortunate
reprobate
unfortunate
reprobate
that
i
should
be
driven
to
wish
that
he
was
in
gaol
your
wishing
so
wo
put
me
there
my
lord
if
it
would
i
should
not
be
weak
enough
to
ask
you
for
this
money
do
you
mean
to
comply
with
my
request
i
do
not
sir
not
a
penny
shall
you
have
not
one
farthing
more
shall
you
get
from
me
then
good
night
my
lord
i
grieve
that
i
should
have
to
undergo
a
siege
in
your
lordship
house
more
especially
as
it
is
likely
to
be
a
long
one
in
a
week
time
there
will
be
a
issued
against
me
and
then
it
will
be
too
late
for
me
to
think
of
france
and
so
saying
the
son
retired
to
his
own
room
and
left
the
father
to
consider
what
he
had
better
do
in
his
distress
footnote
ne

latin
let
him
not
leave
a
legal
writ
forbidding
a
person
to
leave
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
lord
cashel
was
dreadfully
embarrassed
what
lord
kilcullen
said
was
perfectly
true
an
eldest
son
was
a
most
difficult
tenant
to
eject
and
then
the
ignominy
of
having
his
heir
arrested
in
his
own
house
or
detained
there
by
bailiffs
lurking
round
the
premises
he
could
not
determine
whether
it
would
be
more
painful
to
keep
his
son
or
to
give
him
up
if
he
did
the
latter
he
would
be
driven
to
effect
it
by
a
most
disagreeable
process
he
would
have
to
assist
the
officers
of
the
law
in
their
duty
and
to
authorise
them
to
force
the
doors
locked
by
his
son
the
prospect
either
way
was
horrid
he
would
willingly
give
the
five
hundred
pounds
to
be
rid
of
his
heir
were
it
not
for
his
sake
or
rather
his
pride
sake
he
had
said
he
would
not
and
as
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
he
buttoned
up
his
breeches
pocket
and
tried
to
resolve
that
come
what
come
might
he
would
not
expedite
his
son
departure
by
the
outlay
of
one
shilling
the
candles
had
been
put
out
and
the
gloom
of
the
room
was
only
lightened
by
a
single
taper
which
as
it
stood
near
the
door
only
served
to
render
palpable
the
darkness
of
the
further
end
of
the
chamber
for
half
an
hour
lord
cashel
walked
to
and
fro
anxious
wretched
and
in
doubt
instead
of
going
to
his
room
how
he
wished
that
lord
ballindine
had
married
his
ward
and
taken
her
off
six
months
since
all
this
trouble
would
not
then
have
come
upon
him
and
as
he
thought
of
the
thirty
thousand
pounds
that
he
had
spent
and
the
thirty
thousand
more
that
he
must
spend
he
hurried
on
with
such
rapidity
that
in
the
darkness
he
struck
his
shin
violently
against
some
heavy
piece
of
furniture
and
limping
back
to
the
candlestick
swore
through
his
teeth
no
not
a
penny
were
it
to
save
him
from
perdition
i
see
the
sheriff
officer
i
see
the
sheriff
himself
and
tell
him
that
every
door
in
the
house
every
closet
every
cellar
shall
be
open
to
him
my
house
shall
enable
no
one
to
defy
the
law
and
with
this
noble
resolve
to
which
by
the
bye
the
blow
on
his
shin
greatly
contributed
lord
cashel
went
to
bed
and
the
house
was
at
rest
about
nine
on
the
following
morning
lord
kilcullen
was
still
in
bed
but
awake
his
servant
had
been
ordered
to
bring
him
hot
water
and
he
was
seriously
thinking
of
getting
up
and
facing
the
troubles
of
the
day
when
a
very
timid
knock
at
the
door
announced
to
him
that
some
stranger
was
approaching
he
adjusted
his
nightcap
brought
the
up
close
to
his
neck
and
on
giving
the
usual
answer
to
a
knock
at
the
door
saw
a
large
cap
introduce
itself
the
head
belonging
to
which
seemed
afraid
to
follow
who
that
he
called
out
it
me
my
lord
said
the
head
gradually
following
the
cap
griffiths
my
lord
well
lady
selina
my
lord
her
ladyship
bids
me
give
your
lordship
her
love
and
would
you
see
her
ladyship
for
five
minutes
before
you
get
up
lord
kilcullen
having
assented
to
this
proposal
the
cap
and
head
retired
a
second
knock
at
the
door
was
soon
given
and
lady
selina
entered
the
room
with
a
little
bit
of
paper
in
her
hand
good
morning
adolphus
said
the
sister
good
morning
selina
said
the
brother
it
must
be
something
very
particular
which
brings
you
here
at
this
hour
it
is
indeed
something
very
particular
i
have
been
with
papa
this
morning
adolphus
he
has
told
me
of
the
interview
between
you
last
night
well
oh
adolphus
he
is
very
angry
he
so
am
i
selina
i
am
very
angry
too
so
we
quits
we
laid
a
plan
together
and
we
both
failed
and
each
blames
the
other
so
you
need
not
tell
me
anything
further
about
his
anger
did
he
send
any
message
to
me
he
did
he
told
me
i
might
give
you
this
if
i
would
undertake
that
you
left
grey
abbey
and
lady
selina
held
up
but
did
not
give
him
the
bit
of
paper
what
a
dolt
he
is
oh
adolphus
said
selina
do
speak
so
of
your
father
so
he
is
how
on
earth
can
you
undertake
that
i
shall
leave
the
house
i
can
ask
you
to
give
me
your
word
that
you
will
do
so
and
i
can
take
back
the
check
if
you
refuse
said
lady
selina
conceiving
it
utterly
impossible
that
one
of
her
own
family
could
break
his
word
well
selina
i
answer
you
fairly
if
that
bit
of
paper
is
a
cheque
for
five
hundred
pounds
i
will
leave
this
place
in
two
hours
if
it
is
not
it
is
said
selina
it
is
a
cheque
for
five
hundred
pounds
and
i
may
then
give
it
to
you
i
thought
as
much
said
lord
kilcullen
i
thought
he
alter
his
mind
yes
you
may
give
it
me
and
tell
my
father
i
dine
in
london
evening
he
says
adolphus
he
not
see
you
before
you
go
well
there
comfort
in
that
anyhow
oh
adolphus
how
can
you
speak
in
that
manner
now
how
can
you
speak
in
that
wicked
thoughtless
reckless
manner
said
his
sister
because
i
a
wicked
thoughtless
reckless
man
i
suppose
i
mean
to
vex
you
selina
but
my
father
is
so
pompous
so
absurd
and
so
tedious
in
the
whole
of
this
affair
i
have
endeavoured
to
do
exactly
as
he
would
have
me
and
he
is
more
angry
with
me
now
because
his
plan
has
failed
than
he
ever
was
before
for
any
of
my
past
but
let
me
get
up
now
there
a
good
girl
for
i
no
time
to
lose
will
you
see
your
mother
before
you

adolphus
why
no
it
be
no
use
only
tormenting
her
tell
her
something
you
know
anything
that
wo
vex
her
but
i
can
not
tell
her
anything
about
you
that

not
vex
her
well
then
say
what
will
vex
her
least
tell
her
tell
her
oh

what
to
tell
her
and
i
sure

and
fanny

said
kilcullen
i
have
bid
her
good
bye
but
give
her
my
kindest
love
and
tell
her
that
i
did
what
i
told
her
i
would
do
she

me
what
took
place
between

yesterday
why
selina
everybody
tells
you
everything
and
now
i
tell
you
something
if
you
care
for
your
cousin
happiness
do
not
attempt
to
raise
difficulties
between
her
and
lord
ballindine
and
now
i
must
say
good
bye
to
you

my
breakfast

the
yard

bye
adolphus
god

you
and
enable
you
yet
to
retrieve
your
course
i
afraid
it
is
a
bad
one
and
she
stooped
down
and
kissed
her
brother
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
in
two
hours
time
he
had
left
grey
abbey
he
dined
that
day
in
dublin
the
next
in
london
and
the
third
in
boulogne
and
the
of
county
kildare
in
vain
issued
writs
for
his
capture
xxxiv
the
doctor
makes
a
clean
breast
of
it
we
will
now
return
for
a
while
to
dunmore
and
settle
the
affairs
of
the
kellys
and
lynches
which
we
left
in
rather
a
precarious
state
barry
attempt
on
doctor
colligan
virtue
was
very
unsuccessful
for
anty
continued
to
mend
under
the
treatment
of
that
uncouth
but
safe
son
of
galen
as
colligan
told
her
brother
the
fever
had
left
her
though
for
some
time
it
was
doubtful
whether
she
had
strength
to
recover
from
its
effects
this
however
she
did
gradually
and
about
a
fortnight
after
the
dinner
at
dunmore
house
the
doctor
told
mrs
kelly
and
martin
that
his
patient
was
out
of
danger
martin
had
for
some
time
made
up
his
mind
that
anty
was
to
live
for
many
years
in
the
character
of
mrs
martin
and
could
not
therefore
be
said
to
be
much
affected
by
the
communication
but
if
he
was
not
his
mother
was
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
anty
was
to
die
that
she
was
to
pay
for
the
doctor
the
wake
and
the
funeral
and
that
she
would
have
a
hardship
and
grievance
to
boast
of
and
a
subject
of
to
enlarge
on
which
would
have
lasted
her
till
her
death
and
she
consequently
felt
something
like
disappointment
at
being
ordered
to
administer
to
anty
a
mutton
chop
and
a
glass
of
sherry
every
day
at
one
not
that
the
widow
was
less
assiduous
or
less
attentive
to
anty
wants
now
that
she
was
convalescent
but
she
certainly
had
not
so
much
personal
satisfaction
as
when
she
was
able
to
speak
despondingly
of
her
patient
to
all
her
gossips
poor
cratur
she
used
to
say
it
all
up
with
her
now
the
lord
be
praised
for
all
his
mercies
she
all
as
one
as
gone
glory
be
to
god
and
the
blessed
virgin
shure
no
good
ever
come
of
money
not
that
she
was
iver
to
blame
thank
the
lord
av
i
have
a
penny
saved
at
all
it
was
honestly

not
that
i
shall
have
when
this
is
done
and
paid
for
not
a
stifle
stiver
mrs
kelly
probably
meant
but
what
that
and
she
snapped
her
fingers
to
show
that
the
world
gear
was
all
dross
in
her
she
shall
be
dacently
sthretched
though
she
is
a
lynch
and
a
kelly

to

years

there
not
be

all
the
dirthy
money
sim
lynch
scraped
together
out
of
the
gutthers
footnote
stiver
a
dutch
coin
worth
almost
nothing
there
was
a
degree
of
triumph
in
these
lamentations
a
tone
of
assurance
in
the
truth
of
her
melancholy
predictions
which
showed
that
the
widow
was
not
ill
at
ease
with
herself
when
anty
was
declared
out
of
danger
her
joy
was
expressed
with
much
more
moderation
yes
thin
she
said
to
father
pat
geoghegan
poor
thing
rallying
a
bit
the
docthor
says
maybe
she
not
go
this
time
but
he
much
in
dread
of
a
relapse
mrs
kelly
i
suppose
well
relapse
av
you
will
father
pat
relapse
or
reclaps
pretty
much
the
same
i
thinking
for
she
niver
get
through
another
bout
god
send
we
may
be
well
out
of
the
hobble
this
day
twelvemonth
martin
my
own
son
and
ai
above
industhrying
as
his
father
and
mother
did
afore
him
and
i
wo
say
a
word
agin
him
but
he
brought
more
throuble
on
me
with
them
lynches
than
iver
i
knew
before
what
has
a
lone
woman
like
me
father
pat
to
do
wid
sthrangers
like
them
jist
to
turn
their
backs
on
me
when
i
ai
no
furder
use
and
to
be
gitting
the
hights
of
insolence
and
abuse
as
i
did
from
that
blagguard
barry
he
betther
keep
his
toe
in
his
pump
and
go
asy
or
he
wake
to
a
sore
morning
yet
some
day
doctor
colligan
also
was
in
trouble
from
his
connection
with
the
lynches
not
that
he
had
any
dissatisfaction
at
the
recovery
of
his
patient
for
he
rejoiced
at
it
both
on
her
account
and
his
own
he
had
strongly
that
feeling
of
which
must
always
be
enjoyed
by
a
doctor
who
brings
a
patient
safely
through
a
dangerous
illness
but
barry
iniquitous
proposal
to
him
weighed
heavy
on
his
conscience
it
was
now
a
week
since
it
had
been
made
and
he
had
spoken
of
it
to
no
one
he
had
thought
much
and
frequently
of
what
he
ought
to
do
whether
he
should
publicly
charge
lynch
with
the
fact
whether
he
should
tell
it
confidentially
to
some
friend
whom
he
could
trust
or
whether
by
far
the
easiest
alternative
he
should
keep
it
in
his
own
bosom
and
avoid
the
man
in
future
as
he
would
an
incarnation
of
the
devil
it
preyed
much
upon
his
spirits
for
he
lived
in
fear
of
barry
lynch
in
fear
lest
he
should
determine
to
have
the
first
word
and
in
his
own
defence
accuse
him
colligan
of
the
very
iniquity
which
he
had
himself
committed
nothing
the
doctor
felt
would
be
too
bad
or
too
false
for
barry
lynch
nothing
could
be
more
damnable
than
the
proposal
he
had
made
and
yet
it
would
be
impossible
to
convict
him
impossible
to
punish
him
he
would
of
course
deny
the
truth
of
the
accusation
and
probably
return
the
charge
on
his
accuser
and
yet
colligan
felt
that
he
would
be
compromising
the
matter
if
he
did
not
mention
it
to
some
one
and
that
he
would
outrage
his
own
feelings
if
he
did
not
express
his
horror
at
the
murder
which
he
had
been
asked
to
commit
for
one
week
these
feelings
quite
destroyed
poor
colligan
peace
of
mind
during
the
second
he
determined
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
and
on
the
first
day
of
the
third
week
after
turning
in
his
mind
twenty
different
people
martin
kelly
young
daly
the
widow
the
parish
priest
the
parish
parson
the
nearest
stipendiary
magistrate
and
a
brother
doctor
in
tuam
he
at
last
determined
on
going
to
lord
ballindine
as
being
both
a
magistrate
and
a
friend
of
the
kellys
doctor
colligan
himself
was
not
at
all
acquainted
with
lord
ballindine
he
attended
none
of
the
family
who
extensively
patronised
his
rival
and
he
had
never
been
inside
kelly
court
house
he
felt
therefore
considerable
embarrassment
at
his
mission
but
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
and
manfully
setting
himself
in
his
antique
rickety
gig
started
early
enough
to
catch
lord
ballindine
as
he
thought
before
he
left
the
house
after
breakfast
lord
ballindine
had
spent
the
last
week
or
ten
days
restlessly
enough
armstrong
his
clerical
ambassador
had
not
yet
started
on
his
mission
to
grey
abbey
and
innumerable
difficulties
seemed
to
arise
to
prevent
his
doing
so
first
of
all
the
black
cloth
was
to
be
purchased
and
a
tailor
sufficiently
adept
for
making
up
the
new
suit
was
to
be
caught
this
was
a
work
of
some
time
for
though
there
is
in
the
west
of
ireland
a
very
general
complaint
of
the
stagnation
of
trade
trade
itself
is
never
so
stagnant
as
are
the
tradesmen
when
work
is
to
be
done
and
it
is
useless
for
a
poor
wight
to
think
of
getting
his
coat
or
his
boots
till
such
time
as
absolute
want
shall
have
driven
the
artisan
to
look
for
the
price
of
his
job
unless
some
private
and
underhand
influence
be
used
as
was
done
in
the
case
of
jerry
new
leather
breeches
this
cause
of
delay
was
however
not
mentioned
to
lord
ballindine
but
when
it
was
well
got
over
and
a
neighbouring
parson
procured
to
preach
on
the
next
sunday
to
mrs
and
the
three
policemen
who
attended
ballindine
church
mrs
armstrong
broke
her
thumb
with
the
while
making
a
beef
pudding
for
the
family
dinner
and
her
departure
was
again
retarded
and
then
on
the
next
sunday
the
neighbouring
parson
could
not
leave
his
own
policemen
and
the
two
spinsters
who
usually
formed
his
audience
all
this
tormented
lord
ballindine
and
he
was
really
thinking
of
giving
up
the
idea
of
sending
mr
armstrong
altogether
when
he
received
the
following
letter
from
his
friend
dot
blake
limmer
hotel
april
dear
frank
one
cries
out
what
are
you
at
the
other
what
are
you
after
every
one
is
saying
what
a
fool
you
are
kilcullen
is
at
grey
abbey
with
the
evident
intention
of
superseding
you
in
possession
of
miss
w
and
what
is
much
more
to
his
taste
as
it
would
be
to
mine
of
her
fortune
mr
has
written
to
me
grey
where
he
has
been
staying
he
is
a
fellow
and
remembers
how
warmly
you
contradicted
the
report
that
your
match
was
broken
off
for
heaven
sake
follow
up
your
warmth
of
denial
with
some
show
of
positive
action
a
little
less
cool
than
your
present
quiescence
or
you
can
not
expect
that
any
amount
of
love
should
be
strong
enough
to
prevent
your
affianced
from
resenting
your
conduct
i
am
doubly
anxious
quite
as
anxious
that
kilcullen
whom
i
detest
should
not
get
young
wyndham
money
as
i
am
that
you
should
he
is
utterly
smashed
if
he
got
double
the
amount
of
fanny
cash
it
could
not
keep
him
above
water
for
more
than
a
year
or
so
and
then
she
must
go
down
with
him
i
am
sure
the
old
fool
his
father
does
not
half
know
the
amount
of
his
son
liabilities
or
he
could
not
be
heartless
enough
to
consent
to
sacrifice
the
poor
girl
as
she
will
be
sacrificed
if
kilcullen
gets
her
i
am
not
usually
very
anxious
about
other
people
concerns
but
i
do
feel
anxious
about
this
matter
i
want
to
have
a
respectable
house
in
the
country
in
which
i
can
show
my
face
when
i
grow
a
little
older
and
be
allowed
to
sip
my
glass
of
claret
and
talk
about
my
horses
in
spite
of
my
iniquitous
propensities
and
i
expect
to
be
allowed
to
do
so
at
kelly
court
but
if
you
let
miss
wyndham
slip
through
your
fingers
you
wo
have
a
house
over
your
head
in
a
few
time
much
less
a
shelter
to
offer
a
friend
for
god
sake
start
for
grey
abbey
at
once
why
man
alive
the
ogre
ca
eat
you
the
whole
town
is
in
the
devil
of
a
ferment
about
brien
of
course
you
heard
the
rumour
last
week
of
his
heels
being
cracked
some
of
the
knowing
boys
want
to
get
out
of
the
trap
they
are
in
and
despairing
of
bringing
the
horse
down
in
the
betting
by
fair
means
got
a
boy
out
of
scott
stables
to
swear
to
the
fact
i
went
down
at
once
to
yorkshire
and
published
a
letter
in
last
saturday
stating
that
he
is
all
right
this
you
have
probably
seen
you
will
be
astonished
to
hear
it
but
i
believe
lord
tattenham
corner
got
the
report
spread
for
heaven
sake
do
mention
this
particularly
not
as
coming
from
me
they
say
that
if
brien
does
the
trick
he
will
lose
more
than
he
has
made
these
three
years
and
i
believe
he
will
he
is
nominally
at
to
but
you
ca
get
to
anything
like
a
figure
from
a
safe
party
for
heaven
sake
go
to
grey
abbey
and
at
once
always
faithfully
blake
this
letter
naturally
increased
lord
ballindine
uneasiness
and
he
wrote
a
note
to
mr
armstrong
informing
him
that
he
would
not
trouble
him
to
go
at
all
unless
he
could
start
the
next
day
indeed
that
he
should
then
go
himself
if
mr
armstrong
did
not
do
so
this
did
not
suit
mr
armstrong
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
go
he
could
not
well
return
the
twenty
pounds
he
had
received
nor
did
he
wish
to
forego
the
advantage
which
might
arise
from
the
trip
so
he
told
his
wife
to
be
very
careful
about
her
thumb
made
up
his
mind
to
leave
the
three
policemen
for
once
without
spiritual
food
and
wrote
to
lord
ballindine
to
say
that
he
would
be
with
him
the
next
morning
immediately
after
breakfast
on
his
road
to
catch
the
at
ballyglass
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
or
rather
better
for
he
breakfasted
at
kelly
court
and
induced
lord
ballindine
to
get
into
his
own
gig
and
drive
him
as
far
as
the
road
but
you
be
four
or
five
hours
too
soon
said
frank
the
coach
does
pass
ballyglass
till
three
i
want
to
see
those
cattle
of
rutledge
i
stay
there
and
maybe
get
a
bit
of
luncheon
it
not
a
bad
thing
to
be
provided
for
the
road
i
tell
you
what
though
said
frank
i
want
to
go
to
tuam
so
you
might
as
well
get
the
coach
there
and
if
there
time
to
spare
you
can
pay
your
respects
to
the
bishop
it
was
all
the
same
to
mr
armstrong
and
the
two
therefore
started
for
tuam
together
they
had
not
however
got
above
half
way
down
the
avenue
when
they
saw
another
gig
coming
towards
them
and
after
sundry
speculations
as
to
whom
it
might
contain
mr
armstrong
pronounced
the
driver
to
be
that
dirty
gallipot
colligan
it
was
colligan
and
as
the
two
gigs
met
in
the
narrow
road
the
dirty
gallipot
took
off
his
hat
and
was
very
sorry
to
trouble
lord
ballindine
but
had
a
few
words
to
say
to
him
on
very
important
and
pressing
business
lord
ballindine
touched
his
hat
and
intimated
that
he
was
ready
to
listen
but
gave
no
signs
of
getting
out
of
his
gig
my
lord
said
colligan
it
particularly
important
and
if
you
could
as
a
magistrate
spare
me
five
minutes
oh
certainly
mr
colligan
said
frank
that
is
i
rather
hurried
i
may
say
very
much
hurried
just
at
present
but
still
i
suppose
there
no
objection
to
mr
armstrong
hearing
what
you
have
to
say
why
my
lord
said
colligan
i
do
know
your
lordship
can
judge
yourself
afterwards
but
i
rather
oh
i
get
down
said
the
parson
i
just
take
a
walk
among
the
trees
i
suppose
the
doctor
wo
be
long
if
you
would
mind
getting
into
my
buggy
and
letting
me
into
his
lordship
gig
you
could
be
following
us
on
mr
armstrong
suggested
colligan
this
suggestion
was
complied
with
the
parson
and
the
doctor
changed
places
and
the
latter
awkwardly
enough
but
with
perfect
truth
whispered
his
tale
into
lord
ballindine
ear
at
first
frank
had
been
annoyed
at
the
interruption
but
as
he
learned
the
cause
of
it
he
gave
his
full
attention
to
the
matter
and
only
interrupted
the
narrator
by
exclamations
of
horror
and
disgust
when
doctor
colligan
had
finished
lord
ballindine
insisted
on
repeating
the
whole
affair
to
mr
armstrong
i
could
not
take
upon
myself
said
he
to
advise
you
what
to
do
much
less
to
tell
you
what
you
should
do
there
is
only
one
thing
clear
you
can
not
let
things
rest
as
they
are
armstrong
is
a
man
of
the
world
and
will
know
what
to
do
you
can
not
object
to
talking
the
matter
over
with
him
colligan
consented
and
armstrong
having
been
summoned
drove
the
doctor
buggy
up
alongside
of
lord
ballindine
gig
armstrong
said
frank
i
have
just
heard
the
most
horrid
story
that
ever
came
to
my
ears
that
wretch
barry
lynch
has
tried
to
induce
doctor
colligan
to
poison
his
sister
what
shouted
armstrong
to
poison
his
sister
gently
mr
armstrong
pray
do
speak
so
loud
or
it
be
all
through
the
country
in
no
time
poison
his
sister
repeated
armstrong
oh
it
hang
him
no
doubt
it
hang
him
of
course
you
take
the
information
but
the
doctor
has
tendered
me
any
information
said
frank
stopping
his
horse
so
that
armstrong
was
able
to
get
close
up
to
his
elbow
but
i
presume
it
is
his
intention
to
do
so
said
the
parson
i
should
choose
to
have
another
magistrate
present
then
said
frank
really
doctor
colligan
i
think
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
come
before
myself
and
the
stipendiary
magistrate
at
tuam
we
shall
be
sure
to
find
brew
at
home
but
my
lord
said
colligan
i
really
had
no
intention
of
doing
that
i
have
no
witnesses
i
can
prove
nothing
indeed
i
ca
say
he
ever
asked
me
to
do
the
deed
he
did
say
anything
i
could
charge
him
with
as
a
crime
he
only
offered
me
the
farm
if
his
sister
should
die
but
i
knew
what
he
meant
there
was
no
mistaking
it
i
saw
it
in
his
eye
and
what
did
you
do
doctor
colligan
at
the
time
said
the
parson
i
hardly
remember
said
the
doctor
i
was
so
flurried
but
i
know
i
knocked
him
down
and
then
i
rushed
out
of
the
room
i
believe
i
threatened
i
have
him
hung
but
you
did
knock
him
down
oh
i
did
he
was
sprawling
on
the
ground
when
i
left
him
you
quite
sure
you
knocked
him
down
repeated
the
parson
the
divil
a
doubt
on
earth
about
that
replied
colligan
i
tell
you
when
i
left
the
room
he
was
on
his
back
among
the
chairs
and
you
did
not
hear
a
word
from
him
since
not
a
word
then
there
ca
be
any
mistake
about
it
my
lord
said
armstrong
if
he
did
not
feel
that
his
life
was
in
the
doctor
hands
he
would
not
put
up
with
being
knocked
down
and
i
tell
you
what
more
if
you
tax
him
with
the
murder
he
deny
it
and
defy
you
but
tax
him
with
having
been
knocked
down
and
he
swear
his
foot
slipped
or
that
he
have
done
as
much
for
the
doctor
if
he
had
run
away
and
then
ask
him
why
the
doctor
knocked
him
down
you
have
him
on
the
hip
so
there
something
in
that
said
frank
but
the
question
is
what
is
doctor
colligan
to
do
he
says
he
ca
swear
any
information
on
which
a
magistrate
could
commit
him
unless
he
does
my
lord
said
armstrong
i
do
think
you
should
listen
to
him
at
all
at
least
not
as
a
magistrate
well
doctor
colligan
what
do
you
say
i
do
know
what
to
say
my
lord
i
came
to
your
lordship
for
advice
both
as
a
magistrate
and
as
a
friend
of
the
young
man
who
is
to
marry
lynch
sister
of
course
if
you
can
not
advise
me
i
will
go
away
again
you
wo
come
before
me
and
mr
brew
then
i
do
say
i
wo
said
colligan
but
i
do
see
the
use
i
not
able
to
prove
anything
i
tell
you
what
ballindine
said
the
parson
only
i
do
know
whether
it
may
be
tampering
with
justice
suppose
we
were
to
go
to
this
you
and
i
together
and
telling
him
what
we
know
give
him
his
option
to
stand
his
trial
or
quit
the
country
take
my
word
for
it
he
go
and
that
would
be
the
best
way
to
be
rid
of
him
he
leave
his
sister
in
peace
and
quiet
then
to
enjoy
her
fortune
that
true
said
frank
and
it
would
be
a
great
thing
to
rid
the
country
of
him
do
you
remember
the
way
he
rode
of
that
poor
bitch
of
mine
the
other
day
goneaway
you
know
the
best
bitch
in
the
pack
indeed
i
do
said
the
parson
but
for
all
that
she
was
the
best
bitch
in
the
pack
she
had
half
the
nose
of
gaylass
but
as
i
was
saying
armstrong
it
would
be
a
great
thing
to
rid
the
country
of
barry
lynch
indeed
it
would
and
there
be
nothing
then
to
prevent
young
kelly
marrying
anty
at
once
make
him
give
his
consent
in
writing
before
you
let
him
go
said
armstrong
i
tell
you
what
doctor
colligan
said
frank
do
you
get
into
your
own
gig
and
follow
us
on
and
i
talk
the
matter
over
with
mr
armstrong
the
doctor
again
returned
to
his
buggy
and
the
parson
to
his
own
seat
and
lord
ballindine
drove
off
at
a
pace
which
made
it
difficult
enough
for
doctor
colligan
to
keep
him
in
sight
i
do
know
how
far
we
can
trust
that
apothecary
said
frank
to
his
friend
he
an
honest
man
i
believe
said
armstrong
though
he
a
dirty
drunken
blackguard
maybe
he
was
drunk
this
evening
at
lynch
i
was
wrong
to
call
him
a
drunkard
i
believe
he
does
get
drunk
though
he
always
drinking
but
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
what
telling
you
now
is
as
true
as
gospel
if
he
was
telling
a
lie
from
malice
he
be
louder
and
more
urgent
about
it
you
see
he
half
afraid
to
speak
as
it
is
he
would
not
have
come
near
you
at
all
only
his
conscience
makes
him
afraid
to
keep
the
matter
to
himself
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
ballindine
barry
lynch
did
propose
to
him
to
murder
his
sister
indeed
it
does
surprise
me
he
is
so
utterly
worthless
but
murder
armstrong
downright
murder
of
the
worst
kind
studied
premeditated
he
must
have
been
thinking
of
it
and
planning
it
for
days
a
man
may
be
worthless
and
yet
not
such
a
wretch
as
that
would
make
him
can
you
really
think
he
meant
colligan
to
murder
his
sister
i
can
and
do
think
so
said
the
parson
the
temptation
was
great
he
had
been
waiting
for
his
sister
death
and
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
bear
disappointment
i
do
not
think
he
could
do
it
with
his
own
hand
for
he
is
a
coward
but
i
can
quite
believe
that
he
could
instigate
another
person
to
do
it
then
i
hang
him
i
would
raise
my
hand
to
save
him
from
the
rope
nor
would
i
but
we
ca
hang
him
we
can
do
nothing
to
him
if
he
defies
us
but
if
he
well
handled
we
can
drive
him
from
the
country
the
lord
and
the
parson
talked
the
matter
over
till
they
reached
dunmore
and
agreed
that
they
would
go
with
colligan
to
barry
lynch
tell
him
of
the
charge
which
was
brought
against
him
and
give
him
his
option
of
standing
his
trial
or
of
leaving
the
country
under
a
written
promise
that
he
would
never
return
to
it
in
this
case
he
was
also
to
write
a
note
to
anty
signifying
his
consent
that
she
should
marry
martin
kelly
and
also
execute
some
deed
by
which
all
control
over
the
property
should
be
taken
out
of
his
own
hands
and
that
he
should
agree
to
receive
his
income
whatever
it
might
be
through
the
hands
of
an
agent
there
were
sundry
matters
connected
with
the
subject
which
were
rather
difficult
of
arrangement
in
the
first
place
frank
was
obliged
very
unwillingly
to
consent
that
mr
armstrong
should
remain
at
any
rate
one
day
longer
in
the
country
it
was
however
at
last
settled
that
he
should
return
that
night
and
sleep
at
kelly
court
then
lord
ballindine
insisted
that
they
should
tell
young
kelly
what
they
were
about
before
they
went
to
barry
house
as
it
would
be
necessary
to
consult
him
as
to
the
disposition
he
would
wish
to
have
made
of
the
property
armstrong
was
strongly
against
this
measure
but
it
was
at
last
decided
on
and
then
they
had
to
induce
colligan
to
go
with
them
he
much
wished
them
to
manage
the
business
without
him
he
had
had
quite
enough
of
dunmore
house
and
in
spite
of
the
valiant
manner
in
which
he
had
knocked
its
owner
down
the
last
time
he
was
there
seemed
now
quite
afraid
to
face
him
but
mr
armstrong
informed
him
that
he
must
go
on
now
as
he
had
said
so
much
and
at
last
frightened
him
into
an
unwilling
compliance
the
three
of
them
went
up
into
the
little
parlour
of
the
inn
and
summoned
martin
to
the
conference
and
various
were
the
conjectures
made
by
the
family
as
to
the
nature
of
the
business
which
brought
three
such
persons
to
the
inn
together
but
the
widow
settled
them
all
by
asserting
that
a
kelly
need
be
afeared
thank
god
to
see
his
own
landlord
in
his
own
house
nor
though
he
brought
an
attorney
wid
him
as
well
as
a
parson
and
a
docther
and
so
martin
was
sent
for
and
soon
heard
the
horrid
story
not
long
after
he
had
joined
them
the
four
sallied
out
together
and
meg
remarked
that
something
very
bad
was
going
to
happen
for
the
lord
never
passed
her
before
without
a
kind
word
or
a
nod
and
now
he
took
no
more
notice
of
her
than
if
it
had
been
only
sally
herself
that
met
him
on
the
stairs
xxxv
mr
lynch
bids
farewell
to
dunmore
poor
martin
was
dreadfully
shocked
and
not
only
shocked
but
grieved
and
astonished
he
had
never
thought
well
of
his
intended
but
he
had
not
judged
him
so
severely
as
mr
armstrong
had
done
he
listened
to
all
lord
ballindine
said
to
him
and
agreed
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
measures
he
proposed
but
there
was
nothing
of
elation
about
him
at
the
downfall
of
the
man
whom
he
could
not
but
look
on
as
his
enemy
indeed
he
was
not
only
subdued
and
modest
in
his
demeanour
but
he
appeared
so
reserved
that
he
could
hardly
be
got
to
express
any
interest
in
the
steps
which
were
to
be
taken
respecting
the
property
it
was
only
when
lord
ballindine
pointed
out
to
him
that
it
was
his
duty
to
guard
anty
interests
that
he
would
consent
to
go
to
dunmore
house
with
them
and
to
state
when
called
upon
to
do
so
what
measures
he
would
wish
to
have
adopted
with
regard
to
the
property
suppose
he
denies
himself
to
us
said
frank
as
the
four
walked
across
the
street
together
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
whole
population
if
he
in
the
house
i
go
bail
we
wo
go
away
without
seeing
him
said
the
parson
will
he
be
at
home
kelly
do
you
think
indeed
he
will
mr
armstrong
said
martin
he
be
in
bed
and
asleep
he
never
out
of
bed
i
believe
much
before
one
or
two
in
the
day
it
a
bad
life
he
leading
since
the
ould
man
died
you
may
say
that
said
the
doctor
cursing
and
drinking
drinking
and
cursing
nothing
else
you
find
him
curse
at
you
dreadful
mr
armstrong
i
afraid
i
can
bear
that
doctor
it
part
of
my
own
trade
you
know
but
i
think
we
find
him
quiet
enough
i
think
you
find
the
difficulty
is
to
make
him
speak
at
all
you
better
be
spokesman
my
lord
as
you
a
magistrate
no
armstrong
i
will
not
you
much
more
able
and
more
fitting
if
it
necessary
for
me
to
act
as
a
magistrate
i
do
so
but
at
first
we
leave
him
to
you
very
well
said
the
parson
and
i
do
my
best
but
i
tell
you
what
i
am
afraid
of
if
we
find
him
in
bed
we
must
wait
for
him
and
when
the
servant
tells
him
who
we
are
and
mentions
the
doctor
name
along
with
yours
my
lord
he
guess
what
we
come
about
and
he
be
out
of
the
window
or
into
the
cellar
and
then
there
be
no
catching
him
without
the
police
we
must
make
our
way
up
into
his
i
do
think
we
could
well
do
that
said
the
doctor
no
armstrong
said
lord
ballindine
i
do
think
we
ought
to
force
ourselves
upstairs
we
might
as
well
tell
all
the
servants
what
come
about
and
so
we
must
said
armstrong
if
it
necessary
the
more
determined
we
are
in
fact
the
rougher
we
are
with
him
the
more
likely
we
are
to
bring
him
on
his
knees
i
tell
you
you
must
have
no
scruples
in
dealing
with
such
a
fellow
but
leave
him
to
me
and
so
saying
the
parson
gave
a
thundering
rap
at
the
hail
door
and
in
about
one
minute
repeated
it
which
brought
biddy
running
to
the
door
without
shoes
or
stockings
with
her
hair
streaming
behind
her
head
and
in
her
hand
the
comb
with
which
she
had
been
disentangling
it
is
your
master
at
home
said
armstrong
begorra
he
is
said
the
girl
out
of
breath
that
is
he
not
up
yet
nor
awake
yer
honer
and
she
held
the
door
in
her
hand
as
though
this
answer
was
final
but
i
want
to
see
him
on
especial
and
immediate
business
said
the
parson
pushing
back
the
door
and
the
girl
together
and
walking
into
the
hall
i
must
see
him
at
once
mr
lynch
will
excuse
me
we
known
each
other
a
long
time
begorra
i
do
know
said
the
girl
only
he
in
bed
and
fast
could
yer
honer
call
agin
about
four
or
five
that
the
time
the
masther
most
fittest
to
be
talking
to
the
likes
of
yer
honer
these
gentlemen
could
not
wait
said
the
parson
shure
the
docther
there
and
mr
martin
knows
well
enough
i
not
telling
you
a
bit
of
a
lie
misther
armstrong
said
the
girl
i
know
you
not
my
good
girl
i
know
you
not
telling
a
lie
but
nevertheless
i
must
see
mr
lynch
just
step
up
and
wake
him
and
tell
him
i
waiting
to
say
two
words
to
him
faix
yer
honer
he
very
bitther
intirely
when
he
waked
this
early
but
in
course
i
be
led
by
yer
honers
i
say
then
that
the
lord
and
parson
armstrong
and
the
docther
and
mr
martin
is
waiting
to
spake
two
words
to
him
is
that
it
that
do
as
well
as
anything
said
armstrong
and
then
when
the
girl
went
upstairs
he
continued
you
see
she
knew
us
all
and
of
course
will
tell
him
who
we
are
but
i
not
let
him
escape
for
go
up
with
her
and
as
the
girl
slowly
opened
her
master
door
mr
armstrong
stood
close
outside
it
in
the
passage
after
considerable
efforts
biddy
succeeded
in
awaking
her
master
sufficiently
to
make
him
understand
that
lord
ballindine
and
doctor
colligan
were
downstairs
and
that
parson
armstrong
was
just
outside
the
door
the
poor
girl
tried
hard
to
communicate
her
tidings
in
such
a
whisper
as
would
be
inaudible
to
the
parson
but
this
was
impossible
for
barry
only
swore
at
her
and
asked
her
what
the
d
she
meant
by
jabbering
there
in
that
manner
when
however
he
did
comprehend
who
his
visitors
were
and
where
they
were
he
gnashed
his
teeth
and
clenched
his
fist
at
the
poor
girl
in
sign
of
his
anger
against
her
for
having
admitted
so
unwelcome
a
party
but
he
was
too
frightened
to
speak
mr
armstrong
soon
put
an
end
to
this
dumb
show
by
walking
into
the
when
the
girl
escaped
and
he
shut
the
door
barry
sat
up
in
his
bed
rubbed
his
eyes
and
stared
at
him
but
he
said
nothing
mr
lynch
said
the
parson
i
had
better
at
once
explain
the
circumstances
which
have
induced
me
to
make
so
very
strange
a
visit
confounded
strange
i
must
say
to
come
up
to
a
man
room
in
this
way
and
him
in
bed
doctor
colligan
is
downstairs
d
doctor
colligan
he
at
his
lies
again
i
suppose
much
i
care
for
doctor
colligan
doctor
colligan
is
downstairs
continued
mr
armstrong
and
lord
ballindine
who
you
are
aware
is
a
magistrate
they
wish
to
speak
to
you
mr
lynch
and
that
at
once
i
suppose
they
can
wait
till
a
man
dressed
that
depends
on
how
long
you
dressing
mr
lynch
upon
my
word
this
is
cool
enough
in
a
man
own
house
said
barry
well
you
do
expect
me
to
get
up
while
you
there
i
suppose
indeed
i
do
mr
lynch
never
mind
me
just
wash
and
dress
yourself
as
though
i
was
here
i
wait
here
till
we
go
down
together
i
d
d
if
i
do
said
barry
i
not
stir
while
you
remain
there
and
he
threw
himself
back
in
the
bed
and
wrapped
the
bedclothes
round
him
very
well
said
mr
armstrong
and
then
going
out
on
to
the
called
out
over
the
banisters
doctor
doctor
colligan
tell
his
lordship
mr
lynch
objects
to
a
private
interview
he
had
better
just
step
down
to
the
and
issue
his
warrant
you
might
as
well
tell
constable
nelligan
to
be
in
the
way
d
n
exclaimed
barry
sitting
bolt
upright
in
his
bed
who
says
i
object
to
see
anybody
mr
armstrong
what
do
you
go
and
say
that
for
mr
armstrong
returned
into
the
room
it
not
true
i
only
want
to
have
my
to
myself
while
i
get
up
for
once
in
the
way
mr
lynch
you
must
manage
to
get
up
although
your
privacy
be
intruded
on
to
tell
you
the
plain
truth
i
will
not
leave
you
till
you
come
downstairs
with
me
unless
it
be
in
the
custody
of
a
policeman
if
you
will
quietly
dress
and
come
downstairs
with
me
i
trust
we
may
be
saved
the
necessity
of
troubling
the
police
at
all
barry
at
last
gave
way
and
gradually
extricating
himself
from
the
bedclothes
put
his
feet
down
on
the
floor
and
remained
sitting
on
the
side
of
his
bed
he
leaned
his
head
down
on
his
hands
and
groaned
inwardly
for
he
was
very
sick
and
the
fumes
of
last
night
punch
still
disturbed
his
brain
his
stockings
and
drawers
were
on
for
terry
when
he
put
him
to
bed
considered
it
only
waste
of
time
to
pull
them
off
for
shure
would
they
have
jist
to
go
on
agin
the
next
morning
do
be
particular
mr
lynch
never
mind
washing
or
shaving
till
we
gone
we
wo
keep
you
long
i
hope
you
very
kind
i
must
say
said
barry
i
suppose
you
wo
object
to
my
having
a
bottle
of
soda
water
and
he
gave
a
terrible
tug
at
the
bell
not
at
all
nor
a
glass
of
brandy
in
it
if
you
like
it
indeed
mr
lynch
i
think
that
just
at
present
it
will
be
the
better
thing
for
you
barry
got
his
bottle
of
soda
water
and
swallowed
about
two
glasses
of
whiskey
in
it
for
brandy
was
beginning
to
be
scarce
with
him
and
then
commenced
his
toilet
he
took
parson
armstrong
hint
and
was
very
particular
about
it
he
huddled
on
his
clothes
smoothed
his
hair
with
his
brush
and
muttering
something
about
it
being
their
own
fault
descended
into
the
parlour
followed
by
mr
armstrong
he
made
a
kind
of
bow
to
lord
ballindine
took
no
notice
of
martin
but
turning
round
sharp
on
the
doctor
said
of
all
the
false
ruffians
i
ever
met
colligan
by
heavens
the
worst
there
one
comfort
no
man
in
dunmore
will
believe
a
word
you
say
he
then
threw
himself
back
into
the
easy
chair
and
said
well
gentlemen
well
my
lord
here
i
am
you
ca
say
i
ashamed
to
show
my
face
though
i
must
say
your
visit
is
not
made
in
the
genteelest
manner
mr
lynch
said
the
parson
do
you
remember
the
night
doctor
colligan
knocked
you
down
in
this
room
in
this
room
was
it
doctor
yes
in
this
room
said
the
doctor
rather
do
you
remember
the
circumstance
mr
lynch
it
a
lie
said
barry
no
it
not
said
the
parson
if
you
forget
it
i
can
call
in
the
servant
to
remember
so
much
as
that
for
me
but
you
find
it
better
mr
lynch
to
let
us
finish
this
business
among
ourselves
come
think
about
it
i
sure
you
remember
being
knocked
down
by
the
doctor
i
remember
a
scrimmage
there
was
between
us
i
do
care
what
the
girl
says
she
did
see
it
colligan
i
suppose
has
given
her
and
she
swear
anything
for
that
well
you
remember
the
night
of
the
scrimmage
i
do
colligan
got
drunk
here
one
night
he
wanted
me
to
give
him
a
farm
and
said
cursed
queer
things
about
my
sister
i
hardly
know
what
he
said
but
i
know
i
had
to
turn
him
out
of
the
house
and
there
was
a
scrimmage
between
us
i
see
you
so
far
prepared
mr
lynch
now
i
tell
you
my
version
of
the
martin
kelly
just
see
that
the
door
is
shut
you
endeavoured
to
bribe
doctor
colligan
to
murder
your
own
sister
it
a
most
infernal
lie
said
barry
where
your
evidence
where
your
evidence
what
the
good
of
your
all
coming
here
with
such
a
story
as
that
where
your
evidence
you
better
be
quiet
mr
lynch
or
we
adjourn
at
once
from
here
to
the
open
adjourn
when
you
like
it
all
one
to
me
who
believe
such
a
drunken
ruffian
as
that
colligan
i
like
to
know
such
a
story
as
that
my
lord
said
armstrong
i
afraid
we
must
go
on
with
this
business
at
the
martin
i
believe
i
must
trouble
you
to
go
down
to
the
police
barrack
and
the
whole
party
except
barry
rose
from
their
seats
what
the
devil
are
you
going
to
drag
me
down
to
the
for
gentlemen
said
he
i
give
you
any
satisfaction
but
you
expect
i
own
to
such
a
lie
as
this
about
my
sister
i
suppose
my
word
as
good
as
colligan
gentlemen
i
suppose
my
character
as
a
protestant
gentleman
stands
higher
than
his
a
dirty
papist
apothecary
he
tells
one
story
i
tell
another
only
he
got
the
first
word
of
me
that
all
i
suppose
gentlemen
i
not
to
be
condemned
on
the
word
of
such
a
man
as
that
i
think
mr
lynch
said
armstrong
if
you
listen
to
me
save
yourself
and
us
a
great
deal
of
trouble
you
asked
me
who
my
witness
was
my
witness
is
in
this
house
i
would
not
charge
you
with
so
horrid
so
damnable
a
crime
had
i
not
thoroughly
convinced
myself
you
were
guilty
now
do
hold
your
tongue
mr
lynch
or
i
will
have
you
down
to
the
we
all
know
you
are
guilty
you
know
it
yourself
i
began
barry
stop
mr
lynch
not
one
word
till
i
done
or
what
i
have
to
say
shall
be
said
in
public
we
all
know
you
are
guilty
but
we
probably
may
be
able
to
prove
it
no
i
should
think
not
shouted
barry
we
may
be
able
to
prove
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
enable
a
jury
to
hang
you
or
upon
my
word
i
would
interfere
to
prevent
it
the
law
should
have
its
course
i
hang
you
with
as
little
respite
as
i
would
a
dog
barry
grinned
horribly
at
this
suggestion
but
said
nothing
and
the
parson
continued
it
is
not
the
want
of
evidence
that
stands
in
the
way
of
so
desirable
a
proceeding
but
that
doctor
colligan
thoroughly
disgusted
and
shocked
at
the
iniquity
of
your
proposal
oh
go
on
mr
armstrong
go
on
i
see
you
are
determined
to
have
it
all
your
own
way
but
my
turn
come
soon
i
say
that
doctor
colligan
interrupted
you
before
you
fully
committed
yourself
fully
committed
myself
indeed
why
colligan
knows
well
enough
that
when
he
got
up
in
such
a
fluster
there
not
been
a
word
at
all
said
about
anty
had
there
mr
lynch
just
now
you
said
you
turned
the
doctor
out
of
your
house
for
speaking
about
your
sister
you
only
committing
yourself
i
say
therefore
the
evidence
though
quite
strong
enough
to
put
you
into
the
dock
as
a
murderer
in
intention
might
not
be
sufficient
to
induce
a
jury
to
find
you
guilty
but
guilty
you
would
be
esteemed
in
the
mind
of
every
man
woman
and
child
in
this
county
guilty
of
the
wilful
deliberate
murder
of
your
own
sister
by
heavens
i
not
stand
this
exclaimed
i
not
stand
this
i
did
do
it
mr
armstrong
i
did
do
it
he
a
liar
lord
ballindine
upon
my
sacred
word
and
honour
as
a
gentleman
he
a
liar
why
do
you
believe
him
when
you
wo
believe
me
ai
i
a
protestant
mr
armstrong
and
ai
you
a
protestant
clergyman
you
know
that
such
men
as
he
will
tell
any
lie
will
do
any
dirty
job
on
my
sacred
word
of
honour
as
a
gentleman
lord
ballindine
he
offered
to
poison
anty
on
condition
he
got
the
farm
round
the
house
for
nothing
he
knows
it
true
and
why
should
you
believe
him
sooner
than
me
mr
armstrong
barry
had
got
up
from
his
seat
and
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
now
standing
opposite
lord
ballindine
and
appealing
to
him
and
then
doing
the
same
thing
to
mr
armstrong
he
was
a
horrid
figure
he
had
no
collar
round
his
neck
and
his
handkerchief
was
put
on
in
such
a
way
as
to
look
like
a
hangman
knot
his
face
was
blotched
and
red
and
greasy
for
he
had
neither
shaved
nor
washed
himself
since
his
last
night
debauch
he
had
neither
waistcoat
nor
braces
on
and
his
trousers
fell
on
his
hips
his
long
hair
hung
over
his
eyes
which
were
bleared
and
bloodshot
he
was
suffering
dreadfully
from
terror
and
an
intense
anxiety
to
shift
the
guilt
from
himself
to
doctor
colligan
he
was
a
most
pitiable
object
so
wretched
so
unmanned
so
low
in
the
scale
of
creation
lord
ballindine
did
pity
his
misery
and
suggested
to
mr
armstrong
whether
by
any
possibility
there
could
be
any
mistake
in
the
matter
whether
it
was
possible
doctor
colligan
could
have
mistaken
lynch
object
the
poor
wretch
jumped
at
this
and
doubly
condemned
himself
by
doing
so
he
did
then
said
barry
he
must
have
done
so
as
i
hope
for
heaven
lord
ballindine
i
never
had
the
idea
of
getting
him
to
to
do
anything
to
anty
i
would
have
done
it
for
worlds
indeed
i
would
there
must
be
some
mistake
indeed
there
must
he
been
drinking
mr
armstrong
drinking
a
good
deal
that
night
is
that
true
doctor
colligan
come
man
speak
the
truth
do
go
and
try
and
hang
a
fellow
out
of
mistake
his
lordship
sees
it
all
a
mistake
and
of
course
he
the
best
able
to
judge
of
the
lot
here
a
magistrate
and
a
nobleman
and
all
i
know
you
wo
see
me
wronged
lord
ballindine
i
know
you
wo
i
give
you
my
sacred
word
of
honour
as
a
gentleman
it
all
came
from
mistake
when
we
were
both
drunk
or
nearly
drunk
come
doctor
colligan
speak
man
is
that
the
truth
i
tell
you
mr
armstrong
lord
ballindine
in
the
right
of
it
there
is
some
mistake
in
all
this
as
sure
as
the
lord
in
heaven
said
the
doctor
now
becoming
a
little
uneasy
at
the
idea
that
lord
ballindine
should
think
he
had
told
so
strange
a
story
without
proper
foundation
as
sure
as
the
lord
in
heaven
he
offered
me
the
farm
for
a
reward
should
i
manage
to
prevent
his
sister
recovery
what
do
you
think
mr
armstrong
said
lord
ballindine
think
said
the
parson
there
no
possibility
of
thinking
at
all
the
truth
becomes
clearer
every
moment
why
you
wretched
creature
it
not
ten
minutes
since
you
yourself
accused
doctor
colligan
of
offering
to
murder
your
sister
according
to
your
own
showing
therefore
there
was
a
deliberate
conversation
between
you
and
your
own
evasion
now
would
prove
which
of
you
were
the
murderer
were
any
additional
proof
wanted
but
it
is
not
barry
lynch
as
sure
as
you
now
stand
in
the
presence
of
your
creator
whose
name
you
so
constantly
blaspheme
you
endeavoured
to
instigate
that
man
to
murder
your
own
sister
oh
lord
ballindine
oh
lord
ballindine
shrieked
barry
in
his
agony
do
desert
me
pray
pray
do
desert
me
i
did
do
it
i
never
thought
of
doing
it
we
were
at
school
together
were
we
and
you
wo
see
me
put
upon
this
way
you
may
think
much
of
me
in
other
things
but
you
wo
believe
that
a
of
your
own
ever
ever
ever
barry
could
bring
himself
to
use
the
words
with
which
his
sentence
should
be
finished
and
so
he
flung
himself
back
into
his
armchair
and
burst
into
tears
you
appeal
to
me
mr
lynch
said
lord
ballindine
and
i
must
say
i
most
firmly
believe
you
to
be
guilty
my
only
doubt
is
whether
you
should
not
at
once
be
committed
for
trial
at
the
next
assizes
oh
my
g
exclaimed
barry
and
for
some
time
he
continued
blaspheming
most
horribly
swearing
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
against
him
accusing
mr
armstrong
in
the
most
bitter
terms
of
joining
with
doctor
colligan
and
martin
kelly
to
rob
and
murder
him
now
mr
lynch
continued
the
parson
as
soon
as
the
unfortunate
man
would
listen
to
him
as
i
before
told
you
i
am
in
doubt
we
are
all
in
doubt
whether
or
not
a
jury
would
hang
you
and
we
think
that
we
shall
do
more
good
to
the
community
by
getting
you
out
of
the
way
than
by
letting
you
loose
again
after
a
trial
which
will
only
serve
to
let
everyone
know
how
great
a
wretch
there
is
in
the
county
we
will
therefore
give
you
your
option
either
to
stand
your
trial
or
to
leave
the
country
at
once
and
for
ever
and
my
property
what
to
become
of
my
property
said
barry
your
property
safe
mr
lynch
we
ca
touch
that
we
not
prescribing
any
punishment
to
you
we
fear
indeed
we
know
beyond
the
reach
of
the
law
or
we
should
make
the
proposal
barry
breathed
freely
again
as
he
heard
this
avowal
but
you
not
beyond
the
reach
of
public
opinion
of
public
execration
of
general
hatred
and
of
a
general
curse
for
your
sister
sake
for
the
sake
of
martin
kelly
who
is
going
to
marry
the
sister
whom
you
wished
to
murder
and
not
for
your
own
sake
you
shall
be
allowed
to
leave
the
country
without
this
public
brand
being
put
upon
your
name
if
you
remain
no
one
shall
speak
to
you
but
as
to
a
man
who
would
have
murdered
his
sister
murder
shall
be
everlastingly
muttered
in
your
ears
nor
will
your
going
then
avail
you
for
your
character
shall
go
with
you
and
the
very
blackguards
with
whom
you
delight
to
assort
shall
avoid
you
as
being
too
bad
even
for
their
society
go
now
mr
lynch
go
at
once
leave
your
sister
to
happiness
which
you
can
not
prevent
and
she
at
least
shall
know
nothing
of
your
iniquity
and
you
shall
enjoy
the
proceeds
of
your
property
anywhere
you
will
anywhere
that
is
but
in
ireland
do
you
agree
to
this
i
an
innocent
man
mr
armstrong

am

well
said
the
parson
then
we
may
as
well
go
away
and
leave
you
to
your
fate
come
lord
ballindine
we
can
have
nothing
further
to
say
and
they
again
all
rose
from
their
seats
stop
mr
armstrong
stop
said
barry
well
said
the
parson
for
barry
repressed
the
words
which
were
in
his
mouth
when
he
found
that
his
visitors
did
stop
as
he
desired
them
well
mr
lynch
what
have
you
further
to
say
indeed
i
am
not
guilty
mr
armstrong
put
on
his
hat
and
rushed
to
the
door
but
continued
barry

if

in

your
creditors

dare
to
tell

of
the
horrid
accusation
which

against

and

to
galway
barry
sat
silent
for
a
while
trying
to
think
the
parson
was
like
an
incubus
upon
him
which
he
was
totally
unable
to
shake
off
he
knew
neither
how
to
resist
nor
how
to
give
way
misty
ideas
got
into
his
head
of
escaping
to
his
and
blowing
his
own
brains
out
different
schemes
of
retaliation
and
revenge
flitted
before
him
but
he
could
decide
on
nothing
there
he
sat
silent
stupidly
gazing
at
nothing
while
lord
ballindine
and
mr
armstrong
stood
whispering
over
the
fire
i
afraid
we
in
the
wrong
i
really
think
we
are
said
frank
we
must
go
through
with
it
now
any
way
said
the
parson
come
mr
lynch
i
will
give
you
five
minutes
more
and
then
i
go
and
he
pulled
out
his
watch
and
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
looking
at
it
lord
ballindine
walked
to
the
window
and
martin
kelly
and
doctor
colligan
sat
in
distant
parts
of
the
room
with
long
faces
silent
and
solemn
breathing
heavily
how
long
those
five
minutes
appeared
to
them
and
how
short
to
barry
the
time
was
not
long
enough
to
enable
him
to
come
to
any
decision
at
the
end
of
the
five
minutes
he
was
still
gazing
vacantly
before
him
he
was
still
turning
over
in
his
brain
one
after
another
the
same
crowd
of
undigested
schemes
the
time
is
out
mr
lynch
will
you
go
said
the
parson
i
no
money
hoarsely
croaked
barry
if
that
the
only
difficulty
we
raise
money
for
him
said
frank
i
advance
him
money
said
martin
do
you
mean
you
no
money
at
all
said
the
parson
do
you
hear
me
say
so
said
barry
and
you
go
if
you
get
money
say
ten
pounds
said
the
parson
ten
pounds
i
can
go
nowhere
with
ten
pounds
you
know
that
well
enough
i
give
him
said
martin
i
sure
his
sister
do
that
for
him
say
fifty
said
barry
and
i
off
at
once
i
have
got
it
said
martin
no
said
the
parson
i
not
see
you
bribed
to
go
take
the
that
will
last
you
till
you
make
arrangements
about
your
property
we
are
not
going
to
pay
you
for
going
mr
lynch
you
seem
very
anxious
about
it
any
way
i
am
anxious
about
it
rejoined
the
parson
i
am
anxious
to
save
your
sister
from
knowing
what
it
was
that
her
brother
wished
to
accomplish
barry
scowled
at
him
as
though
he
would
like
if
possible
to
try
his
hand
at
murdering
him
but
he
did
not
answer
him
again
arrangements
were
at
last
made
for
barry
departure
and
off
he
went
that
very
day
not
to
roscommon
but
to
tuam
and
there
at
the
instigation
of
martin
daly
the
attorney
took
upon
himself
the
division
and
temporary
management
of
the
property
from
thence
with
martin
or
rather
with
his
sister
pounds
in
his
pocket
he
started
to
that
elysium
for
which
he
had
for
some
time
so
ardently
longed
and
soon
landed
at
boulogne
regardless
alike
of
his
sister
his
future
brother
lord
ballindine
or
mr
armstrong
the
parson
had
found
it
quite
impossible
to
carry
out
one
point
on
which
he
had
insisted
he
could
not
induce
barry
lynch
to
write
to
his
sister
no
not
a
line
not
a
word
had
it
been
to
save
him
from
hanging
he
could
hardly
have
induced
himself
to
write
those
common
words
oh
you
can
tell
her
what
you
like
said
he
it
you
making
me
go
away
at
once
in
this
manner
tell
her
whatever
confounded
lies
you
like
tell
her
i
gone
because
i
did
choose
to
stay
and
see
her
make
a
fool
of
herself
and
that
the
truth
too
if
it
was
for
that
i
would
move
a
step
for
any
of
you
he
went
however
as
i
have
before
said
and
troubled
the
people
of
dunmore
no
longer
nor
shall
he
again
trouble
us
oh
but
martin
what
nonsense
said
the
widow
coaxingly
to
her
son
that
night
before
she
went
to
bed
the
lord
would
be
going
up
there
just
to
wish
him
good
bye
and
parson
armstrong
too
what
the
dickens
could
they
be
at
there
so
long
come
martin
you
safe
with
me
you
know
tell
us
something
about
it
now
nonsense
mother
i
nothing
to
tell
barry
lynch
has
left
the
place
for
good
and
all
that
all
about
it
god
bless
the
back
of
him
thin
he
my
lave
for
going
long
since
but
you
might
be
telling
us
what
made
him
be
starting
this
way
all
of
a
heap
do
you
know
mother
he
was
head
and
ears
in
debt
do
tell
me
said
the
widow
parson
armstrong
not
a
officer
that
he
should
be
looking
after
folks
in
debt
no
mother
he
not
that
i
know
of
but
he
do
like
for
all
that
to
see
his
tithes
walking
out
of
the
country
do
be
coming
over
me
that
way
martin
barry
lynch
nor
his
father
before
him
never
held
any
land
in
ballindine
parish
did
they
well
thin
you
know
more
than
i
mother
so
it
no
use
my
telling
you
and
martin
walked
off
to
bed
i
even
you
yet
my
lad
said
she
close
as
you
are
you
see
else
wait
awhile
till
the
money
wanting
and
then
let
see
know
all
about
it
and
the
widow
slapped
herself
powerfully
on
that
part
where
her
pocket
depended
in
sign
of
the
great
confidence
she
had
in
the
strength
of
her
purse
did
i
manage
that
well
said
the
parson
as
lord
ballindine
drove
him
home
to
kelly
court
as
soon
as
the
long
interview
was
over
if
i
can
do
as
well
at
grey
abbey
you
employ
me
again
i
think
upon
my
word
then
armstrong
said
frank
i
never
was
in
such
hot
water
as
i
have
been
all
this
day
and
now
it
over
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
sorry
we
interfered
we
did
what
we
had
no
possible
right
to
do
nonsense
man
you
do
suppose
i
have
dreamed
of
letting
him
off
if
the
law
could
have
touched
him
but
it
could
no
magistrates
in
the
county
could
have
committed
him
for
he
had
done
and
as
far
as
i
can
judge
had
said
literally
nothing
it
true
we
know
what
he
intended
but
a
score
of
magistrates
could
have
done
nothing
with
him
as
it
is
we
got
him
out
of
the
country
he
never
come
back
again
what
i
mean
is
we
had
no
business
to
drive
him
out
of
the
country
with
threats
oh
ballindine
that
nonsense
one
can
keep
no
common
terms
with
such
a
blackguard
as
that
however
it
done
now
and
i
must
say
i
think
it
was
well
done
there
no
doubt
of
your
talent
in
the
matter
armstrong
upon
my
soul
i
never
saw
anything
so
cool
what
a
wretch
what
an
absolute
fiend
the
fellow
is
bad
enough
said
the
parson
i
seen
bad
men
before
but
i
think
he
the
worst
i
ever
saw
what
mrs
say
of
my
coming
in
this
way
without
notice
the
parson
enjoyed
his
claret
at
kelly
court
that
evening
after
his
hard
day
work
and
the
next
morning
he
started
for
grey
abbey
xxxvi
mr
armstrong
visits
grey
abbey
on
a
delicate
mission
lord
cashel
certainly
felt
a
considerable
degree
of
relief
when
his
daughter
told
him
that
lord
kilcullen
had
left
the
house
and
was
on
his
way
to
dublin
though
he
had
been
forced
to
pay
so
dearly
for
the
satisfaction
had
had
to
falsify
his
solemn
assurance
that
he
would
not
give
his
son
another
penny
and
to
break
through
his
resolution
of
acting
the
roman
father
he
consoled
himself
with
the
idea
that
he
had
been
actuated
by
affection
for
his
profligate
son
but
such
had
not
been
the
case
could
he
have
handed
him
over
to
the
sheriff
officer
silently
and
secretly
he
would
have
done
so
but
his
pride
could
not
endure
the
reflection
that
all
the
world
should
know
that
bailiffs
had
forced
an
entry
into
grey
abbey
footnote
roman
father
lucius
junius
brutus
legendary
founder
of
the
roman
republic
was
said
to
have
passed
sentence
of
death
on
his
two
sons
for
participating
in
a
rebellion
he
closely
questioned
lady
selina
with
regard
to
all
that
had
passed
between
her
and
her
brother
did
he
say
anything
at
last
he
said
did
he
say
anything
about
about
fanny
not
much
papa
but
what
he
did
say
he
said
with
kindness
and
affection
replied
her
ladyship
glad
to
repeat
anything
in
favour
of
her
brother
affection
pooh
said
the
earl
he
has
no
affection
no
affection
for
any
one
he
has
no
affection
even
for
what
did
he
say
about
her
selina
he
seemed
to
wish
she
should
marry
lord
ballindine
she
may
marry
whom
she
pleases
now
said
the
earl
i
wash
my
hands
of
her
i
have
done
my
best
to
prevent
what
i
thought
a
disgraceful
match
for
her
it
would
not
have
been
disgraceful
papa
had
she
married
him
six
months
ago
a
gambler
and
a
said
the
earl
forgetting
it
is
to
be
supposed
for
the
moment
his
own
son
character
she
marry
him
now
i
suppose
and
repent
at
her
leisure
i
give
myself
no
further
trouble
about
it
the
earl
thought
upon
the
subject
however
a
good
deal
and
before
mr
armstrong
arrival
he
had
all
but
made
up
his
mind
that
he
must
again
swallow
his
word
and
ask
his
ward
lover
back
to
his
house
he
had
at
any
rate
become
assured
that
if
he
did
not
do
so
some
one
else
would
do
it
for
him
mr
armstrong
was
happily
possessed
of
a
considerable
stock
of
and
during
his
first
day
journey
felt
no
want
of
it
with
regard
to
the
delicate
mission
with
which
he
was
entrusted
but
when
he
had
deposited
his
at
the
little
hotel
at
kilcullen
bridge
and
found
himself
seated
on
a
hack
car
and
proceeding
to
grey
abbey
he
began
to
feel
that
he
had
rather
a
difficult
part
to
play
and
by
the
time
that
the
house
was
in
sight
he
felt
himself
completely
puzzled
as
to
the
manner
in
which
he
should
open
his
negotiation
he
had
however
desired
the
man
to
drive
to
the
house
and
he
could
not
well
stop
the
car
in
the
middle
of
the
demesne
to
mature
his
plans
and
when
he
was
at
the
door
he
could
not
stay
there
without
applying
for
admission
so
he
got
his
in
his
hand
and
rang
the
bell
after
a
due
interval
which
to
the
parson
did
not
seem
a
bit
too
long
the
powdered
footman
appeared
and
announced
that
lord
cashel
was
at
home
and
in
another
minute
mr
armstrong
found
himself
in
the
it
was
the
morning
after
lord
kilcullen
departure
and
lord
cashel
was
still
anything
but
comfortable
her
ladyship
had
been
bothering
him
about
the
poor
boy
as
she
called
her
son
now
that
she
learned
he
was
in
distress
and
had
been
beseeching
him
to
increase
his
allowance
the
earl
had
not
told
his
wife
the
extent
of
their
son
pecuniary
delinquencies
and
consequently
she
was
greatly
dismayed
when
her
husband
very
solemnly
said
my
lady
lord
kilcullen
has
no
longer
any
allowance
from
me
good
gracious
screamed
her
ladyship
no
allowance
how
is
the
poor
boy
to
live
that
i
really
can
not
tell
i
can
not
even
guess
but
let
him
live
how
he
may
i
will
not
absolutely
ruin
myself
for
his
sake
the
interview
was
not
a
comfortable
one
either
to
the
father
or
mother
lady
cashel
cried
a
great
deal
and
was
very
strongly
of
opinion
that
her
son
would
die
of
cold
and
starvation
how
could
he
get
shelter
or
food
any
more
than
a
common
person
if
he
had
no
allowance
might
he
at
any
rate
come
back
and
live
at
grey
abbey
that
would
cost
his
father
anything
and
then
the
countess
remembered
how
she
had
praised
her
son
to
mrs
ellison
and
the
wife
and
she
cried
worse
than
ever
and
was
obliged
to
be
left
to
griffiths
and
her
drops
this
happened
on
the
evening
of
lord
kilcullen
departure
and
on
the
next
morning
her
ladyship
did
not
appear
at
breakfast
she
was
weak
and
nervous
and
had
her
tea
in
her
own
there
was
no
one
sitting
at
breakfast
but
the
earl
fanny
and
lady
selina
and
they
were
all
alike
stiff
cold
and
silent
the
earl
felt
as
if
he
were
not
at
home
even
in
his
own
he
felt
afraid
of
his
ward
as
though
he
were
conscious
that
she
knew
how
he
had
intended
to
injure
her
and
as
soon
as
he
had
swallowed
his
eggs
he
muttered
something
which
was
inaudible
to
both
the
girls
and
retreated
to
his
private
den
he
had
not
been
there
long
before
the
servant
brought
in
our
name
the
rev
george
armstrong
written
on
a
plain
card
the
parson
had
not
put
the
name
of
his
parish
fearing
that
the
earl
knowing
from
whence
he
came
might
guess
his
business
and
decline
seeing
him
as
it
was
no
difficulty
was
made
and
the
parson
soon
found
himself
with
the
earl
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
calling
on
you
lord
cashel
said
mr
armstrong
having
accepted
the
offer
of
a
chair
on
a
rather
delicate
mission
the
earl
bowed
and
rubbed
his
hands
and
felt
more
comfortable
than
he
had
done
for
the
last
week
he
liked
delicate
missions
coming
to
him
for
he
flattered
himself
that
he
knew
how
to
receive
them
in
a
delicate
manner
he
liked
also
displaying
his
dignity
to
strangers
for
he
felt
that
strangers
stood
rather
in
awe
of
him
he
also
felt
though
he
did
not
own
it
to
himself
that
his
manner
was
not
so
effective
with
people
who
had
known
him
some
time
i
may
say
a
very
delicate
mission
said
the
parson
and
one
i
would
not
have
undertaken
had
i
not
known
your
lordship
character
for
candour
and
honesty
lord
cashel
again
bowed
and
rubbed
his
hands
i
am
my
lord
a
friend
of
lord
ballindine
and
as
such
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
calling
on
your
lordship
a
friend
of
lord
ballindine
said
the
earl
arching
his
eyebrows
and
assuming
a
look
of
great
surprise
a
very
old
friend
my
lord
the
clergyman
of
his
parish
and
for
many
years
an
intimate
friend
of
his
father
i
have
known
lord
ballindine
since
he
was
a
child
lord
ballindine
is
lucky
in
having
such
a
friend
few
young
men
now
i
am
sorry
to
say
care
much
for
their
father
friends
is
there
anything
mr
armstrong
in
which
i
can
assist
either
you
or
his
lordship
my
lord
said
the
parson
i
need
not
tell
you
that
before
i
took
the
perhaps
unwarrantable
liberty
of
troubling
you
i
was
made
acquainted
with
lord
ballindine
engagement
with
your
ward
and
with
the
manner
in
which
that
engagement
was
broken
off
and
your
object
is
mr
armstrong
my
object
is
to
remove
if
possible
the
unfortunate
misunderstanding
between
your
lordship
and
my
friend
misunderstanding
mr
armstrong
there
was
no
misunderstanding
between
us
i
really
think
we
perfectly
understood
each
other
lord
ballindine
was
engaged
to
my
ward
his
engagement
however
being
contingent
on
his
adoption
of
a
certain
line
of
conduct
this
line
of
conduct
his
lordship
did
not
adopt
perhaps
he
used
a
wise
discretion
however
i
thought
not
i
thought
the
mode
of
life
which
he
pursued
but
pardon
me
a
moment
mr
armstrong
and
i
shall
have
said
all
which
appears
to
me
to
be
necessary
on
the
occasion
perhaps
more
than
is
necessary
more
probably
than
i
should
have
allowed
myself
to
say
had
not
lord
ballindine
sent
as
his
ambassador
the
clergyman
of
his
parish
and
the
friend
of
his
father
and
lord
cashel
again
bowed
and
rubbed
his
hands
i
thought
mr
armstrong
that
your
young
friend
appeared
wedded
to
a
style
of
life
quite
incompatible
with
his
income
with
his
own
income
as
a
single
man
and
the
income
which
he
would
have
possessed
had
he
married
my
ward
i
thought
that
their
marriage
would
only
lead
to
poverty
and
distress
and
i
felt
that
i
was
only
doing
my
duty
to
my
ward
in
expressing
this
opinion
to
her
i
found
that
she
was
herself
of
the
same
opinion
that
she
feared
a
union
with
lord
ballindine
would
not
ensure
happiness
either
to
him
or
to
herself
his
habits
were
too
evidently
those
of
extravagance
and
hers
had
not
been
such
as
to
render
a
life
of
privation
anything
but
a
life
of
misery
i
had
thought
one
moment
more
mr
armstrong
and
i
shall
have
done
after
mature
consideration
miss
wyndham
commissioned
me
to
express
her
sentiments
and
i
must
say
they
fully
coincided
with
my
own
to
lord
ballindine
and
to
explain
to
him
that
she
found
herself
obliged
to
to
to
retrace
the
steps
which
she
had
taken
in
the
matter
i
did
this
in
a
manner
as
little
painful
to
lord
ballindine
as
i
was
able
it
is
difficult
mr
armstrong
to
make
a
disagreeable
communication
palatable
it
is
very
difficult
to
persuade
a
young
man
who
is
in
love
to
give
up
the
object
of
his
idolatry
but
i
trust
lord
ballindine
will
do
me
the
justice
to
own
that
on
the
occasion
alluded
to
i
said
nothing
unnecessarily
harsh
nothing
calculated
to
harass
his
feelings
i
appreciate
and
esteem
lord
ballindine
good
qualities
and
i
much
regretted
that
prudence
forbad
me
to
sanction
the
near
alliance
he
was
anxious
to
do
me
the
honour
of
making
with
me
lord
cashel
finished
his
harangue
and
felt
once
more
on
good
terms
with
himself
he
by
no
means
intended
offering
any
further
vehement
resistance
to
his
ward
marriage
he
was
indeed
rejoiced
to
have
an
opportunity
of
giving
way
decently
but
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
explaining
his
conduct
and
making
a
speech
my
lord
said
the
parson
what
you
tell
me
is
only
a
repetition
of
what
i
heard
from
my
young
friend
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
i
trust
then
i
may
have
the
pleasure
of
feeling
that
lord
ballindine
attributes
to
me
no
personal
unkindness
not
in
the
least
lord
cashel
very
far
from
it
though
lord
ballindine
may
not
be
may
not
hitherto
have
been
free
from
the
follies
of
his
age
he
has
had
quite
sense
enough
to
appreciate
your
lordship
conduct
i
endeavoured
at
any
rate
that
it
should
be
such
as
to
render
me
liable
to
no
just
imputation
of
fickleness
or
cruelty
no
one
would
for
a
moment
accuse
your
lordship
of
either
it
is
my
knowledge
of
your
lordship
character
in
this
particular
which
has
induced
me
to
undertake
the
task
of
begging
you
to
reconsider
the
subject
lord
ballindine
has
you
are
aware
sold
his
i
had
heard
so
mr
armstrong
though
perhaps
not
on
good
authority
he
has
and
is
now
living
among
his
own
tenantry
and
friends
at
kelly
court
he
is
passionately
devotedly
attached
to
your
ward
lord
cashel
and
with
a
young
man
vanity
he
still
thinks
that
she
may
not
be
quite
indifferent
to
him
it
was
at
her
own
instance
mr
armstrong
that
his
suit
was
rejected
i
am
well
aware
of
that
my
lord
but
ladies
you
know
do
sometimes
mistake
their
own
feelings
miss
wyndham
must
have
been
attached
to
my
friend
or
she
would
not
have
received
him
as
her
lover
will
you
my
lord
allow
me
to
see
miss
wyndham
if
she
still
expresses
indifference
to
lord
ballindine
i
will
assure
her
that
she
shall
be
no
further
persecuted
by
his
suit
if
such
be
not
the
case
surely
prudence
need
not
further
interfere
to
prevent
a
marriage
desired
by
both
the
persons
most
concerned
lord
ballindine
is
not
now
a
spendthrift
whatever
he
may
formerly
have
been
and
miss
wyndham
princely
fortune
though
it
alone
would
never
have
induced
my
friend
to
seek
her
hand
will
make
the
match
all
that
it
should
be
you
will
not
object
my
lord
to
my
seeing
miss
wyndham
mr
armstrong
really
you
must
be
aware
such
a
request
is
rather
unusual
so
are
the
circumstances
replied
the
parson
they
also
are
unusual
i
do
not
doubt
miss
wyndham
wisdom
in
rejecting
lord
ballindine
when
as
you
say
he
appeared
to
be
wedded
to
a
life
of
extravagance
i
have
no
doubt
she
put
a
violent
restraint
on
her
own
feelings
exercised
in
fact
a
which
shows
a
very
high
tone
of
character
and
should
elicit
nothing
but
admiration
but
circumstances
are
much
altered
lord
cashel
continued
to
raise
objections
to
the
parson
request
though
it
was
throughout
the
interview
his
intention
to
accede
to
it
at
last
he
gave
up
the
point
with
much
grace
and
in
such
a
manner
as
he
thought
should
entitle
him
to
the
eternal
gratitude
of
his
ward
lord
ballindine
and
the
parson
he
consequently
rang
the
bell
and
desired
the
servant
to
give
his
compliments
to
miss
wyndham
and
tell
her
that
the
rev
mr
armstrong
wished
to
see
her
alone
upon
business
of
importance
mr
armstrong
felt
that
his
success
was
much
greater
than
he
had
had
any
reason
to
expect
from
lord
ballindine
description
of
his
last
visit
at
grey
abbey
he
had
in
fact
overcome
the
only
difficulty
if
miss
wyndham
really
disliked
his
friend
and
objected
to
the
marriage
mr
armstrong
was
well
aware
that
he
had
only
to
return
and
tell
his
friend
so
in
the
best
way
he
could
if
however
she
still
had
a
true
regard
for
him
if
she
were
the
fanny
wyndham
ballindine
had
described
her
to
be
if
she
had
ever
really
been
devoted
to
him
if
she
had
at
all
a
wish
in
her
heart
to
see
him
again
at
her
feet
the
parson
felt
that
he
would
have
good
news
to
send
back
to
kelly
court
and
that
he
would
have
done
the
lovers
a
service
which
they
never
could
forget
at
any
rate
mr
armstrong
said
lord
cashel
as
the
parson
was
bowing
himself
backwards
out
of
the
room
you
will
join
our
family
circle
while
you
are
in
the
neighbourhood
whatever
may
be
the
success
of
your
mission
and
i
assure
you
i
hope
it
may
be
such
as
will
be
gratifying
to
you
i
am
happy
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
any
friend
of
lord
ballindine
when
lord
ballindine
chooses
his
friends
so
well
this
was
meant
as
a
slap
at
dot
blake
you
will
give
me
leave
to
send
down
to
the
town
for
your
luggage
mr
armstrong
made
no
objection
to
this
proposal
and
the
luggage
was
sent
for
the
servant
again
took
him
in
tow
and
ushered
him
out
of
the
across
the
hall
through
the
and
into
the
library
gave
him
a
chair
and
then
brought
him
a
newspaper
giving
him
to
understand
that
miss
wyndham
would
soon
be
with
him
the
parson
took
the
paper
in
his
hands
but
he
did
not
trouble
himself
much
with
the
contents
of
it
what
was
he
to
say
to
miss
wyndham
how
was
he
to
commence
he
had
never
gone
for
another
in
his
life
and
now
at
his
advanced
age
it
really
did
come
rather
strange
to
him
and
then
he
began
to
think
whether
she
were
short
or
tall
dark
or
fair
stout
or
slender
it
certainly
was
very
odd
but
in
all
their
conversations
on
the
subject
lord
ballindine
had
never
given
him
any
description
of
his
inamorata
mr
armstrong
however
had
not
much
time
to
make
up
his
mind
on
any
of
these
points
for
the
door
opened
and
miss
wyndham
entered
she
was
dressed
in
black
for
she
was
of
course
still
in
mourning
for
her
brother
but
in
spite
of
her
sable
habiliments
she
startled
the
parson
by
the
brilliance
of
her
beauty
there
was
a
quiet
dignity
of
demeanour
natural
to
fanny
wyndham
a
pose
and
a
grace
of
motion
which
saved
her
from
ever
looking
awkward
or
confused
she
never
appeared
to
lose
her
though
never
arrogant
she
seemed
always
to
know
what
was
due
to
herself
no
insignificant
puppy
could
ever
have
attempted
to
flirt
with
her
when
summoned
by
the
servant
to
meet
a
strange
clergyman
alone
in
the
library
at
the
request
of
lord
cashel
she
felt
that
his
visit
must
have
some
reference
to
her
lover
indeed
her
thoughts
for
the
last
few
days
had
run
on
little
else
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
talk
to
her
cousin
about
him
then
her
cousin
had
matured
that
determination
by
making
love
to
her
himself
then
she
had
talked
to
him
of
lord
ballindine
and
he
had
promised
to
talk
to
his
father
on
the
same
subject
and
she
had
since
been
endeavouring
to
bring
herself
to
make
one
other
last
appeal
to
her
uncle
feelings
her
mind
was
therefore
full
of
lord
ballindine
when
she
walked
into
the
library
but
her
face
was
no
her
gait
and
demeanour
were
as
dignified
as
though
she
had
no
anxious
love
within
her
heart
no
one
grand
desire
to
disturb
the
even
current
of
her
blood
she
bowed
her
beautiful
head
to
mr
armstrong
as
she
walked
into
the
room
and
sitting
down
herself
begged
him
to
take
a
chair
the
parson
had
by
no
means
made
up
his
mind
as
to
what
he
was
to
say
to
the
young
lady
so
he
shut
his
eyes
and
rushed
at
once
into
the
middle
of
his
subject
miss
wyndham
he
said
i
have
come
a
long
way
to
call
on
you
at
the
request
of
a
friend
of
yours
a
very
dear
and
old
friend
of
mine
at
the
request
of
lord
ballindine
fanny
countenance
became
deeply
suffused
at
her
lover
name
but
the
parson
did
not
observe
it
indeed
he
hardly
ventured
to
look
in
her
face
she
merely
said
in
a
voice
which
seemed
to
him
to
be
anything
but
promising
well
sir
the
truth
was
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
had
she
dared
she
would
have
fallen
on
her
knees
before
her
lover
friend
and
sworn
to
him
how
well
she
loved
him
when
lord
ballindine
was
last
at
grey
abbey
miss
wyndham
he
had
not
the
honour
of
an
interview
with
you
no
sir
said
fanny
her
voice
look
and
manner
were
still
sedate
and
courtly
her
heart
however
was
beating
so
violently
that
she
hardly
knew
what
she
said
circumstances
i
believe
prevented
it
said
the
parson
my
friend
however
received
through
lord
cashel
a
message
from
you
which
which
which
has
been
very
fatal
to
his
happiness
fanny
tried
to
say
something
but
she
was
not
able
the
very
decided
tone
in
which
your
uncle
then
spoke
to
him
has
made
lord
ballindine
feel
that
any
further
visit
to
grey
abbey
on
his
own
part
would
be
an
intrusion
i
never
said
fanny
i
never
you
never
authorised
so
harsh
a
message
you
would
say
it
is
not
the
harshness
of
the
language
but
the
certainty
of
the
fact
that
has
destroyed
my
friend
happiness
if
such
were
to
be
the
case
if
it
were
absolutely
necessary
that
the
engagement
between
you
and
lord
ballindine
should
be
broken
off
the
more
decided
the
manner
in
which
it
were
done
the
better
lord
ballindine
now
wishes
i
am
a
bad
messenger
in
such
a
case
as
this
miss
wyndham
it
is
perhaps
better
to
tell
you
at
once
a
plain
tale
frank
has
desired
me
to
tell
you
that
he
loves
you
well
and
truly
that
he
can
not
believe
you
are
indifferent
to
him
that
your
vows
to
him
so
precious
are
still
ringing
in
his
ears
that
he
is
as
far
as
his
heart
is
concerned
unchanged
and
he
has
commissioned
me
to
ascertain
from
yourself
whether
you
have
really
changed
your
mind
since
he
last
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
the
parson
waited
a
moment
for
an
answer
and
then
added
lord
ballindine
by
no
means
wishes
to
persecute
you
on
the
subject
nor
would
i
do
so
if
he
did
wish
it
you
have
only
to
tell
me
that
you
do
not
intend
to
renew
your
acquaintance
with
lord
ballindine
and
i
will
leave
grey
abbey
fanny
still
remained
silent
say
the
one
word
miss
wyndham
and
you
need
not
pain
yourself
by
any
further
speech
i
will
at
once
be
gone
fanny
strove
hard
to
keep
her
composure
and
to
make
some
fitting
reply
to
mr
armstrong
but
she
was
unable
her
heart
was
too
full
she
was
too
happy
she
had
openly
and
in
spite
of
rebuke
avowed
her
love
to
her
uncle
her
aunt
to
lady
selina
and
her
cousin
but
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
confess
it
to
mr
armstrong
at
last
she
said
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
kindness
mr
armstrong
perhaps
i
owe
it
to
lord
ballindine
to
to
i
will
ask
my
uncle
sir
to
write
to
him
i
shall
write
to
lord
ballindine
this
evening
miss
wyndham
will
you
intrust
me
with
no
message
i
came
from
him
to
see
you
with
no
other
purpose
i
must
give
him
some
news
i
must
tell
him
i
have
seen
you
may
i
tell
him
not
to
despair
tell
him
tell
him
said
fanny
and
she
paused
to
make
up
her
mind
as
to
the
words
of
her
message
tell
him
to
come
himself
and
hurrying
from
the
room
she
left
the
parson
alone
to
meditate
on
the
singular
success
of
his
mission
he
stood
for
about
half
an
hour
thinking
over
what
had
occurred
and
rejoicing
greatly
in
his
mind
that
he
had
undertaken
the
business
what
fools
men
are
about
women
he
said
at
last
to
himself
they
know
their
nature
so
well
when
they
are
thinking
and
speaking
of
them
with
reference
to
others
but
as
soon
as
a
man
is
in
love
with
one
himself
he
is
cowed
he
thinks
the
nature
of
one
woman
is
different
from
that
of
all
others
and
he
is
afraid
to
act
on
his
general
knowledge
well
i
might
as
well
write
to
him
for
thank
god
i
can
send
him
good
news
and
he
rang
the
bell
and
asked
if
his
bag
had
come
it
had
and
was
in
his
could
the
servant
get
him
pen
ink
and
paper
the
servant
did
so
and
within
two
hours
of
his
entering
the
doors
of
grey
abbey
he
was
informing
his
friend
of
the
success
of
his

the
two
following
letters
for

off
in
the

on
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
mr

arrived

april
dear
frank
you
will
own
i
have
not
lost
much
time
i
left
kelly
court
the
day
before
yesterday
and
i
am
already
able
to
send
you
good
news
i
have
seen
lord
cashel
and
have
found
him
anything
but
uncourteous
i
have
also
seen
miss
wyndham
and
though
she
said
but
little
to
me
that
little
was
just
what
you
would
have
wished
her
to
say
she
bade
me
tell
you
to
come
yourself
in
obedience
to
her
commands
i
do
hereby
require
you
to
pack
yourself
up
and
proceed
forthwith
to
grey
abbey
his
lordship
has
signified
to
me
that
it
is
his
intention
in
his
own
and
lady
cashel
name
to
request
the
renewed
pleasure
of
an
immediate
and
he
hopes
a
prolonged
visit
from
your
lordship
you
will
not
my
dear
frank
i
am
sure
be
such
a
fool
as
to
allow
your
dislike
to
such
an
empty
as
this
earl
to
stand
in
the
way
of
your
love
or
your
fortune
you
ca
expect
miss
wyndham
to
go
to
you
so
pocket
your
resentment
like
a
sensible
fellow
and
accept
lord
cashel
invitation
as
though
there
had
been
no
difference
between
you
i
have
also
received
an
invite
and
intend
staying
here
a
day
or
two
i
ca
say
that
judging
from
the
master
of
the
house
i
think
that
a
prolonged
sojourn
would
be
very
agreeable
i
have
as
yet
seen
none
of
the
ladies
except
my
embryo
lady
ballindine
i
think
i
have
done
my
business
a
little
in
the
vidi
style
what
has
effected
the
change
in
lord
cashel
views
i
need
not
trouble
myself
to
guess
you
will
soon
learn
all
about
it
from
miss
wyndham
i
will
not
in
a
letter
express
my
admiration
but
i
will
proclaim
in
connaught
on
my
return
that
so
worthy
a
bride
was
never
yet
brought
down
to
the
far
west
lord
cashel
will
of
course
have
some
pet
bishop
or
dean
to
marry
you
but
after
what
has
passed
i
shall
certainly
demand
the
privilege
of
christening
the
heir
believe
me
dear
frank
your
affectionate
friend
george
armstrong
lord
cashel
letter
was
as
follows
it
cost
his
lordship
three
hours
to
compose
and
was
twice
copied
i
trust
therefore
it
is
a
fair
specimen
of
what
a
nobleman
ought
to
write
on
such
an
occasion
grey
abbey
april
my
dear
lord
circumstances
to
which
i
rejoice
that
i
need
not
now
more
particularly
allude
made
your
last
visit
at
my
house
a
disagreeable
one
to
both
of
us
the
necessity
under
which
i
then
laboured
of
communicating
to
your
lordship
a
decision
which
was
likely
to
be
inimical
to
your
happiness
but
to
form
which
my
duty
imperatively
directed
me
was
a
source
of
most
serious
inquietude
to
my
mind
i
now
rejoice
that
that
decision
was
so
painful
to
you
has
been
so
lastingly
painful
as
i
trust
i
may
measure
your
gratification
at
a
renewal
of
your
connection
with
my
family
by
the
acuteness
of
the
sufferings
which
an
interruption
of
that
connexion
has
occasioned
you
i
have
i
can
assure
you
my
lord
received
much
pleasure
from
the
visit
of
your
very
estimable
friend
the
reverend
mr
armstrong
and
it
is
no
slight
addition
to
my
gratification
on
this
occasion
to
find
your
most
intimate
friendship
so
well
bestowed
i
have
had
much
unreserved
conversation
with
mr
armstrong
and
i
am
led
by
him
to
believe
that
i
may
be
able
to
induce
you
to
give
lady
cashel
and
myself
the
pleasure
of
your
company
at
grey
abbey
we
shall
be
truly
delighted
to
see
your
lordship
and
we
sincerely
hope
that
the
attractions
of
grey
abbey
may
be
such
as
to
induce
you
to
prolong
your
visit
for
some
time
perhaps
it
might
be
unnecessary
for
me
now
more
explicitly
to
allude
to
my
ward
but
still
i
can
not
but
think
that
a
short
but
candid
explanation
of
the
line
of
conduct
i
have
thought
it
my
duty
to
adopt
may
prevent
any
disagreeable
feeling
between
us
should
you
as
i
sincerely
trust
you
will
do
us
the
pleasure
of
joining
our
family
circle
i
must
own
my
dear
lord
that
a
few
months
since
i
feared
you
were
wedded
to
the
expensive
pleasures
of
the
your
acceptance
of
the
office
of
steward
at
the
curragh
meetings
confirmed
the
reports
which
reached
me
from
various
quarters
my
ward
fortune
was
then
not
very
considerable
and
actuated
by
an
uncle
affection
for
his
niece
as
well
as
a
guardian
caution
for
his
ward
i
conceived
it
my
duty
to
ascertain
whether
a
withdrawal
from
the
engagement
in
contemplation
between
miss
wyndham
and
yourself
would
be
detrimental
to
her
happiness
i
found
that
my
ward
views
agreed
with
my
own
she
thought
her
own
fortune
insufficient
seeing
that
your
habits
were
then
expensive
and
perhaps
not
truly
knowing
the
intensity
of
her
own
affection
she
coincided
in
my
views
you
are
acquainted
with
the
result
these
causes
have
operated
in
inducing
me
to
hope
that
i
may
still
welcome
you
by
the
hand
as
my
dear
niece
husband
her
fortune
is
very
greatly
increased
your
character
is
i
will
not
say
altered
is
now
fixed
and
established
and
lastly
and
chiefly
i
find
i
blush
my
lord
to
tell
a
lady
secret
that
my
ward
happiness
still
depends
on
you
i
am
sure
my
dear
lord
i
need
not
say
more
we
shall
be
delighted
to
see
you
at
your
earliest
convenience
we
wish
that
you
could
have
come
to
us
before
your
friend
left
but
i
regret
to
learn
from
him
that
his
parochial
duties
preclude
the
possibility
of
his
staying
with
us
beyond
thursday
i
shall
anxiously
wait
for
your
reply
in
the
meantime
i
beg
to
assure
you
with
the
joint
kind
remembrances
of
all
our
party
that
i
am
most
faithfully
yours
cashel
mr
armstrong
descended
to
the
before
dinner
looking
most
respectable
with
a
stiff
white
tie
and
the
new
suit
expressly
prepared
for
the
occasion
he
was
introduced
to
lady
cashel
and
lady
selina
as
a
valued
friend
of
lord
ballindine
and
was
received
by
the
former
at
least
in
a
most
flattering
manner
lady
selina
had
hardly
reconciled
herself
to
the
return
of
lord
ballindine
it
was
from
no
envy
at
her
cousin
happiness
she
was
really
too
and
too
falsely
proud
also
to
envy
anyone
but
it
was
the
harsh
conviction
of
her
mind
that
no
duties
should
be
disregarded
and
that
all
duties
were
disagreeable
she
was
always
opposed
to
the
doing
of
anything
which
appeared
to
be
the
especial
wish
of
the
person
consulting
her
because
it
would
be
agreeable
she
judged
that
it
would
be
wrong
she
was
most
sincerely
anxious
for
her
poor
dependents
but
she
tormented
them
most
cruelly
when
biddy
finn
wished
to
marry
lady
selina
told
her
it
was
her
duty
to
put
a
restraint
on
her
inclinations
and
ultimately
prevented
her
though
there
was
no
objection
on
earth
to
tony
mara
and
when
the
widow
cullen
wanted
to
open
a
little
shop
for
soap
and
candles
having
eight
pounds
ten
shillings
left
to
stock
it
after
the
wake
and
funeral
were
over
lady
selina
told
the
widow
it
was
her
duty
to
restrain
her
inclination
and
she
did
so
and
the
eight
pounds
ten
shillings
drifted
away
in
quarters
of
tea
and
most
probably
half
noggins
of
whiskey
in
the
same
way
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
think
that
fanny
was
doing
right
in
following
the
bent
of
her
dearest
wishes
in
marrying
this
man
she
loved
so
truly
she
was
weak
she
was
giving
way
to
temptation
she
was
going
back
from
her
word
she
was
she
said
giving
up
her
claim
to
that
high
standard
of
feminine
character
which
it
should
be
the
proudest
boast
of
a
woman
to
maintain
it
was
in
vain
that
her
mother
argued
the
point
with
her
in
her
own
way
but
why
should
she
marry
him
my
dear
said
the
countess
when
they
love
each
other
and
now
there
plenty
of
money
and
all
that
and
your
papa
thinks
it
all
right
i
declare
i
ca
see
the
harm
of
it
i
do
say
there
harm
mother
said
lady
selina
not
absolute
harm
but
there
weakness
she
had
ceased
to
esteem
lord
ballindine
ah
but
my
dear
she
very
soon
began
to
esteem
him
again
poor
dear
she
did
know
how
well
she
loved
him
she
ought
to
have
known
mamma
to
have
known
well
before
she
rejected
him
but
having
rejected
him
no
power
on
earth
should
have
induced
her
to
name
him
or
even
to
think
of
him
again
she
should
have
been
dead
to
him
and
he
should
have
been
the
same
as
dead
to
her
well
i
do
know
said
the
countess
but
i
sure
i
shall
be
delighted
to
see
anybody
happy
in
the
house
again
and
i
always
liked
lord
ballindine
myself
there
was
never
any
trouble
about
his
dinners
or
anything
and
lady
cashel
was
delighted
the
grief
she
had
felt
at
the
abrupt
termination
of
all
her
hopes
with
regard
to
her
son
had
been
too
much
for
her
she
had
been
unable
even
to
mind
her
and
griffiths
had
failed
to
comfort
her
but
from
the
moment
that
her
husband
had
told
her
with
many
hems
and
haws
that
mr
armstrong
had
arrived
to
repeat
lord
ballindine
proposal
and
that
he
had
come
to
consult
her
about
again
asking
his
lordship
to
grey
abbey
she
became
happy
and
and
before
griffiths
had
left
her
for
the
night
she
had
commenced
her
consultations
as
to
the
preparations
for
the
wedding
xxxviii
wait
till
i
tell
you
there
was
no
one
at
dinner
that
first
evening
but
mr
armstrong
and
the
family
circle
and
the
parson
certainly
felt
it
dull
enough
fanny
naturally
was
rather
silent
lady
selina
did
not
talk
a
great
deal
the
countess
reiterated
twenty
times
the
pleasure
she
had
in
seeing
him
at
grey
abbey
and
asked
one
or
two
questions
as
to
the
quantity
of
flannel
it
took
to
make
petticoats
for
the
old
women
in
his
parish
but
to
make
up
the
rest
lord
cashel
talked
incessantly
he
wished
to
show
every
attention
to
his
guest
and
he
crammed
him
with
ecclesiastical
conversation
till
mr
armstrong
felt
that
poor
as
he
was
and
much
as
his
family
wanted
the
sun
of
lordly
favour
he
would
not
give
up
his
little
living
down
in
connaught
where
at
any
rate
he
could
do
as
he
pleased
to
be
domestic
chaplain
to
lord
cashel
with
a
salary
of
a
thousand
the
next
morning
was
worse
and
the
whole
of
the
long
day
was
insufferable
he
endeavoured
to
escape
from
his
noble
friend
into
the
demesne
where
he
might
have
explored
the
fox
coverts
and
ascertained
something
of
the
sporting
capabilities
of
the
country
but
lord
cashel
would
not
leave
him
alone
for
an
instant
and
he
had
not
only
to
endure
the
earl
tediousness
but
also
had
to
assume
a
demeanour
which
was
not
at
all
congenial
to
his
feelings
lord
cashel
would
talk
church
and
to
him
and
descanted
on
the
abominations
of
the
national
system
and
the
glories
of
now
mr
armstrong
had
no
leaning
to
popery
and
had
nothing
to
say
against
sunday
schools
but
he
had
not
one
in
his
own
parish
in
which
by
the
bye
he
was
the
father
of
all
the
protestant
children
to
be
found
there
without
the
slightest
slur
upon
his
reputation
be
it
said
lord
cashel
totally
mistook
his
character
and
mr
armstrong
did
not
know
how
to
set
him
right
and
at
five
he
went
to
dress
more
tired
than
he
ever
had
been
after
hunting
all
day
and
then
riding
home
twelve
miles
on
a
wet
dark
night
with
a
lame
horse
to
do
honour
to
her
guest
lady
cashel
asked
mr
the
rector
together
with
his
wife
and
daughters
to
dine
there
on
the
second
day
and
mr
armstrong
though
somewhat
afraid
of
brother
clergymen
was
delighted
to
hear
that
they
were
coming
anything
was
better
than
another
with
the
ponderous
earl
there
were
no
other
neighbours
near
enough
to
grey
abbey
to
be
asked
on
so
short
a
notice
but
the
rector
his
wife
and
their
daughters
entered
the
punctually
at
six
the
character
and
feelings
of
mr
were
exactly
those
which
the
earl
had
attributed
to
mr
armstrong
he
had
been
an
orangeman
and
was
a
most
ultra
and
even
furious
protestant
he
was
by
principle
a
charitable
man
to
his
neighbours
but
he
hated
popery
and
he
carried
the
feeling
to
such
a
length
that
he
almost
hated
papists
he
had
not
generally
speaking
a
bad
opinion
of
human
nature
but
he
would
not
have
considered
his
life
or
property
safe
in
the
hands
of
any
roman
catholic
he
pitied
the
ignorance
of
the
heathen
the
credulity
of
the
mahommedan
the
desolateness
of
the
jew
even
the
infidelity
of
the
atheist
but
he
execrated

abominated

brimstone
thou
doer
of

devil

thou
false
prophet
thou
ravenous

such
was
the
language
of
his
soul
at
the
sight
of
a
priest
such
would
have
been
the
language
of
his
tongue
had
not
as
he
thought
evil
legislators
given
a
licence
to
falsehood
in
his
unhappy
country
and
rendered
it
impossible
for
a
true
churchman
openly
to
declare
the
whole
truth

the
person
so
excommunicated
is
also
condemned

give
utterance
to
such

as
these

who
as
he
thought
destroyed
the

turned

foxes
yet

by
no

he
did

at

on
one
occasion
at

hall
but
even
his

found
that

did

more
harm
than
good
and
his
public
exhibitions
had
been
as
much
as
possible
discouraged
apart
from
his
fanatical
enthusiasm
he
was
a
good
man
of
pure
life
and
simple
habits
and
rejoiced
exceedingly
that
in
the
midst
of
the
laxity
in
religious
opinions
which
so
generally
disfigured
the
age
his
wife
and
his
children
were
equally
eager
and
equally
zealous
with
himself
in
the
service
of
their
great
master
a
beneficed
clergyman
from
the
most
benighted
that
is
most
papistical
portion
of
connaught
would
be
sure
thought
mr
to
have
a
with
him
to
sympathise
with
his
wailings
and
to
have
similar
woes
to
communicate
how
many
protestants
have
you
said
he
to
mr
armstrong
in
the
a
few
minutes
after
they
had
been
introduced
to
each
other
i
had
two
hundred
and
seventy
in
the
parish
on
new
year
day
and
since
that
we
had
two
births
and
a
very
proper
church
of
england
has
been
sent
here
in
place
of
a
horrid
papist
we
a
great
gain
in
serjeant
woody
my
lord
in
one
way
we
certainly
have
mr
said
the
earl
i
wish
all
the
police
force
were
protestants
i
think
they
would
be
much
more
effective
but
serjeant
carroll
was
a
very
good
man
you
know
he
was
removed
from
hence
on
his
promotion
i
know
he
was
my
lord
just
to
please
the
priests
just
because
he
was
a
papist
do
you
think
there
was
a
single
thing
done
or
a
word
said
at
petty
sessions
but
what
father
flannery
knew
all
about
it
yes
every
word
when
did
the
police
ever
take
any
of
father
flannery
own
people
did
serjeant
carroll
take
that
horrible
man
leary
that
robbed
the
old
widow
that
lived
under
the
bridge
said
the
countess
true
my
lady
he
did
said
mr
but
you
find
if
you
inquire
that
leary
had
paid
the
priest
his
dues
nor
yet
his
brother
how
a
protestant
government
can
reconcile
it
to
their
conscience
how
they
can
sleep
at
night
after
pandering
to
the
priests
as
they
daily
do
i
can
not
conceive
how
many
protestants
did
you
say
you
have
mr
armstrong
we
not
very
strong
down
in
the
west
mr
said
the
other
parson
there
are
usually
two
or
three
in
the
kelly
court
pew
the
vicarage
pew
musters
pretty
well
for
mrs
armstrong
and
five
of
the
children
are
always
there
then
there
are
usually
two
policemen
and
the
clerk
though
by
the
bye
he
does
belong
to
the
parish
i
borrowed
him
from
claremorris
mr
gave
a
look
of
horror
and
astonishment
i
can
however
make
a
boast
which
perhaps
you
can
not
mr
joscelyn
all
my
parishioners
are
usually
to
be
seen
in
church
and
if
one
is
absent
i
able
to
miss
him
it
must
paralyse
your
efforts
preaching
to
such
a
congregation
said
the
other
do
not
disparage
my
congregation
said
mr
armstrong
laughing
they
are
friendly
and
neighbourly
if
not
important
in
point
of
numbers
and
if
i
wanted
to
fill
my
church
the
roman
catholics
think
so
well
of
me
that
they
flock
in
crowds
there
if
i
asked
them
and
the
priest
would
show
them
the
way
for
any
special
occasion
i
mean
if
the
bishop
came
to
see
me
or
anything
of
that
kind
mr
was
struck
dumb
and
indeed
he
would
have
had
no
time
to
answer
if
the
power
of
speech
had
been
left
to
him
for
the
servant
announced
dinner
the
conversation
was
a
little
more
general
during
but
after
dinner
the
parish
clergyman
returned
to
another
branch
of
his
favourite
subject
perhaps
he
thought
that
mr
armstrong
was
himself
not
very
orthodox
or
perhaps
that
it
was
useless
to
enlarge
on
the
abominations
of
babylon
to
a
protestant
peer
and
a
protestant
parson
but
on
this
occasion
he
occupied
himself
with
the
temporal
iniquities
of
the
roman
catholics
the
trial
of
and
his
had
come
to
an
end
and
he
and
they
with
one
exception
had
just
commenced
their
period
of
imprisonment
the
one
exception
was
a
clergyman
who
had
been
acquitted
he
had
in
some
way
been
connected
with
mr
parish
and
as
the
parish
priest
and
most
of
his
flock
were
hot
repealers
there
was
a
good
deal
of
excitement
on
the
occasion
rejoicings
at
the
priest
acquittal
and
howlings
yellings
and
murmurings
at
the
condemnation
of
the
others
we
fallen
on
frightful
days
mr
armstrong
said
mr
frightful
lawless
dangerous
days
we
must
take
them
as
we
find
them
mr
doubtless
mr
armstrong
doubtless
and
i
acknowledge
his
infinite
wisdom
who
for
his
own
purposes
now
allows
sedition
to
rear
her
head
unchecked
and
falsehood
to
sit
in
the
high
places
they
are
indeed
dangerous
days
when
the
sympathy
of
government
is
always
with
the
evil
doers
and
the
religion
of
the
state
is
deserted
by
the
crown
why
god
bless
me
mr
the
queen
has
turned
papist
and
the
repealers
are
all
in
prison
or
soon
will
be
there
i
do
mean
the
queen
i
believe
she
is
very
good
i
believe
she
is
a
sincere
protestant
god
bless
her
and
mr
in
his
loyalty
drank
a
glass
of
port
wine
but
i
mean
her
advisers
they
do
not
dare
protect
the
protestant
faith
they
do
not
dare
secure
the
tranquillity
of
the
country
are
not
and
the
whole
set
under
conviction
at
this
moment
i
no
politician
myself
but
the
only
question
seems
to
be
whether
they
have
gone
a
step
too
far
why
did
they
let
that
priest
escape
them
said
mr
i
suppose
he
was
not
guilty
said
mr
armstrong
at
any
rate
you
had
a
staunch
protestant
jury
i
tell
you
the
priests
are
at
the
head
of
it
all
would
be
nothing
without
them
he
is
only
their
creature
the
truth
is
the
government
did
not
dare
to
frame
an
indictment
that
would
really
lead
to
the
punishment
of
a
priest
the
government
is
truckling
to
the
false
hierarchy
of
rome
look
at
oxford
a
jesuitical
seminary
devoted
to
the
secret
propagation
of
romish
go
into
the
churches
of
england
and
watch
their
bowings
their
genuflexions
their
crosses
and
their
candles
see
the
demeanour
of
their
apostate
clergy
look
into
their
private
oratories
see
their
their
crucifixes
and
images
and
then
can
you
doubt
that
the
most
dreadful
of
all
prophecies
is
about
to
be
accomplished
but
i
have
not
been
into
their
closets
mr
nor
yet
into
their
churches
lately
and
therefore
i
have
not
seen
these
things
nor
have
i
seen
anybody
who
has
have
you
seen
crucifixes
in
the
rooms
of
church
of
england
clergymen
or
candles
on
the
of
english
churches
god
forbid
that
i
should
willingly
go
where
such
things
are
to
be
seen
but
of
the
fearful
fact
there
is
unfortunately
no
doubt
and
then
as
to
the
state
of
the
country
we
have
nothing
round
us
but
anarchy
and
misrule
my
life
mr
armstrong
has
not
been
safe
any
day
this
week
past
good
heaven
mr
your
life
not
safe
i
thought
you
were
as
quiet
here
in
kildare
as
we
are
in
mayo
wait
till
i
tell
you
mr
armstrong
you
know
this
priest
whom
they
have
let
loose
to
utter
more
sedition
he
was
coadjutor
to
the
priest
in
this
parish
was
he
the
people
are
not
attacking
you
i
suppose
because
he
let
loose
wait
till
i
tell
you
no
the
people
are
mad
because
and
his
myrmidons
are
to
be
locked
up
and
mingled
with
their
fury
on
this
head
are
their
insane
rejoicings
at
the
escape
of
this
priest
they
are
therefore
or
were
till
saturday
last
howling
for
joy
and
for
grief
at
the
same
time
oh
such
horrid
howls
mr
armstrong
i
declare
mr
armstrong
i
have
trembled
for
my
children
this
week
past
the
earl
who
well
knew
mr
and
the
nature
of
his
grievances
had
heard
all
these
atrocities
before
and
not
being
very
excited
by
their
interest
had
continued
sipping
his
claret
in
silence
till
he
began
to
doze
and
by
the
time
the
worthy
parson
had
got
to
the
climax
of
his
misery
the
nobleman
was
fast
asleep
you
do
mean
that
the
people
made
any
attack
on
the
parsonage
said
mr
armstrong
wait
till
i
tell
you
mr
armstrong
replied
the
other
on
thursday
morning
last
they
all
heard
that
was
a
convicted
felon
conspirator
i
believe
mr
conspiracy
is
felony
mr
armstrong
and
that
their
priest
had
been
let
loose
it
was
soon
evident
that
no
work
was
to
be
done
that
day
they
assembled
about
the
roads
in
groups
at
the
at
priest
flannery
house
at
the
teetotal
as
they
call
it
where
the
people
drink
cordial
made
of
whiskey
and
disturb
the
neighbourhood
with
cracked
horns
and
we
heard
that
a
public
demonstration
was
to
be
made
was
it
a
demonstration
of
joy
or
of
grief
both
mr
armstrong
it
was
mixed
they
were
to
shout
and
dance
for
joy
about
father
tyrrel
and
howl
and
curse
for
grief
about
and
they
did
shout
and
howl
with
a
vengeance
all
thursday
you
would
have
thought
that
a
legion
of
devils
had
been
let
loose
into
kilcullen
but
did
they
commit
any
personal
outrages
mr
wait
till
i
tell
you
i
soon
saw
how
the
case
was
going
to
be
and
i
determined
to
be
prepared
i
armed
myself
mr
armstrong
and
so
did
mrs
mrs
is
a
most
determined
woman
a
woman
of
great
spirit
we
were
resolved
to
protect
our
daughters
and
our
infants
from
as
long
as
god
should
leave
us
the
power
to
do
so
we
both
armed
ourselves
with
pistols
and
i
can
assure
you
that
as
far
as
ammunition
goes
we
were
prepared
to
give
them
a
hot
reception
dear
me
this
must
have
been
very
unpleasant
to
mrs
oh
she
a
woman
of
great
nerve
mr
armstrong
mary
is
a
woman
of
very
great
nerve
i
can
assure
you
we
shall
never
forget
that
thursday
night
about
seven
in
the
evening
it
got
darkish
but
the
horrid
yells
of
the
wild
creatures
had
never
ceased
for
one
and
a
little
after
seven
twenty
different
bonfires
illuminated
the
parish
there
were
bonfires
on
every
side
of
us
huge
masses
of
blazing
turf
were
to
be
seen
scattered
through
the
whole
country
did
they
burn
any
thing
except
the
turf
mr
wait
till
i
tell
you
mr
armstrong
i
shall
never
forget
that
night
we
neither
of
us
once
lay
down
no
not
for
a
moment
about
eight
the
children
were
put
to
bed
but
with
their
clothes
and
shoes
on
for
there
was
no
knowing
at
what
moment
and
in
how
sudden
a
way
the
poor
innocents
might
be
called
up
my
daughters
behaved
admirably
they
remained
quite
quiet
in
the
till
about
eleven
when
we
had
evening
worship
and
then
they
retired
to
rest
their
mother
however
insisted
that
they
should
not
take
off
their
petticoats
or
stockings
at
about
one
we
went
to
the
it
was
then
bright
moonlight
but
the
flames
of
the
surrounding
turf
overpowered
the
moon
the
whole
horizon
was
one
glare
of
light
but
were
not
the
police
about
mr
oh
they
were
about
to
be
sure
poor
men
but
what
could
they
do
the
government
now
licenses
every
outrage
but
what
the
people
do
said
mr
armstrong
wait
till
i
tell
you
they
remained
up
all
night
and
so
did
we
you
may
be
sure
mary
did
not
rise
from
her
chair
once
that
night
without
a
pistol
in
her
hand
we
heard
the
sounds
of
their
voices
continually
close
to
the
parsonage
gate
we
could
see
them
in
the
road
from
the
windows
crowds
of
them
men
women
and
children
and
still
they
continued
shouting
the
next
morning
they
were
a
little
more
quiet
but
still
the
parish
was
disturbed
nobody
was
at
work
and
men
and
women
stood
collected
together
in
the
roads
but
as
soon
as
it
was
dusk
the
shoutings
and
the
bonfires
began
again
and
again
did
i
and
mrs
prepare
for
a
night
of
anxious
watching
we
sat
up
all
friday
night
mr
armstrong
with
the
pistols
again
indeed
we
did
and
lucky
for
us
that
we
did
so
had
they
not
known
that
we
were
prepared
i
am
convinced
the
house
would
have
been
attacked
our
daughters
sat
with
us
this
night
and
we
were
so
far
used
to
the
state
of
disturbance
that
we
were
able
to
have
a
little
supper
you
must
have
wanted
that
i
think
indeed
we
did
about
four
in
the
morning
i
dropped
asleep
on
the
sofa
but
mary
never
closed
her
eyes
did
they
come
into
the
garden
at
all
or
near
the
house
no
they
did
not
and
i
am
very
thankful
they
refrained
from
doing
so
for
i
determined
to
act
promptly
mr
armstrong
and
so
was
mary
that
is
mrs
we
were
both
determined
to
fire
if
we
found
our
premises
invaded
thank
god
the
miscreants
did
not
come
within
the
gate
you
did
not
suffer
much
then
except
the
anxiety
mr
god
was
very
merciful
and
protected
us
but
who
can
feel
safe
living
in
such
times
and
among
such
a
people
and
it
all
springs
from
rome
the
scarlet
woman
is
now
in
her
full
power
and
in
her
full
deformity
she
was
smitten
down
for
a
while
but
has
now
risen
again
for
a
while
the
right
foot
of
truth
was
on
her
neck
for
a
while
she
lay
prostrated
before
the
strength
of
those
who
by
god
grace
had
prevailed
against
her
but
the
latter
prophecies
which
had
been
revealed
to
us
are
now
about
to
be
accomplished
it
is
well
for
those
who
comprehend
the
signs
of
the
coming
time
suppose
we
join
the
ladies
said
the
earl
awakened
by
the
sudden
lull
in
mr
voice
but
wo
you
take
a
glass
of
madeira
first
mr
armstrong
mr
armstrong
took
his
glass
of
madeira
and
then
went
to
the
ladies
and
the
next
morning
left
grey
abbey
for
his
own
parish
well
thought
he
to
himself
as
he
was
driven
through
the
park
in
the
gig
i
very
glad
i
came
here
for
frank
sake
i
smoothed
his
way
to
matrimony
and
a
fortune
but
i
do
know
anything
which
would
induce
me
to
stay
a
week
at
grey
abbey
the
earl
is
bad
nearly
unbearable
but
the
parson
i
sooner
by
half
be
a
roman
myself
than
think
so
badly
of
my
neighbours
as
he
does
many
a
time
since
has
he
told
in
connaught
how
mr
and
mary
his
wife
sat
up
two
nights
running
armed
to
the
teeth
to
protect
themselves
from
the
noisy
repealers
of
kilcullen
mr
armstrong
arrived
safely
at
his
parsonage
and
the
next
morning
he
rode
over
to
kelly
court
but
lord
ballindine
was
not
there
he
had
started
for
grey
abbey
almost
immediately
on
receiving
the
two
letters
which
we
have
given
and
he
and
his
friend
had
passed
each
other
on
the
road
xxxix
it
never
rains
but
it
pours
when
frank
had
read
his
two
letters
from
grey
abbey
he
was
in
such
a
state
of
excitement
as
to
be
unable
properly
to
decide
what
he
would
immediately
do
his
first
idea
was
to
gallop
to
tuam
as
fast
as
his
best
horse
would
carry
him
to
take
four
horses
there
and
not
to
stop
one
moment
till
he
found
himself
at
grey
abbey
but
a
little
consideration
showed
him
that
this
would
not
do
he
would
not
find
horses
ready
for
him
on
the
road
he
must
take
some
clothes
with
him
and
it
would
be
only
becoming
in
him
to
give
the
earl
some
notice
of
his
approach
so
he
at
last
made
up
his
mind
to
postpone
his
departure
for
a
few
hours
he
was
however
too
much
overcome
with
joy
to
be
able
to
do
anything
rationally
his
anger
against
the
earl
totally
evaporated
indeed
he
only
thought
of
him
now
as
a
man
who
had
a
house
in
which
he
could
meet
his
love
he
rushed
into
the
where
his
mother
and
sisters
were
sitting
and
with
the
two
letters
open
in
his
hand
proclaimed
his
intention
of
leaving
home
that
day
goodness
gracious
frank
and
where
are
you
going
said
mrs
to
grey
abbey
no

augusta

up
from
her
chair
i
am
so
glad
shouted
sophy
throwing
down
her
portion
of
the
sofa
you
have
made
up
your
difference
then
with
miss
wyndham
said
the
anxious
mother
i
am
so
glad
my
own
dear
good
sensible
frank
i
never
had
any
difference
with
fanny
said
he
i
was
not
able
to
explain
all
about
it
nor
can
i
now
it
was
a
crotchet
of
the
earl
only
some
nonsense
however
i
off
now
i
ca
wait
a
day
for
i
mean
to
write
to
say
i
shall
be
at
grey
abbey
the
day
after
and
i
must
go
by
dublin
i
shall
be
off
in
a
couple
of
hours
so
for
heaven
sake
sophy
look
sharp
and
put
up
my
things
the
girls
both
bustled
out
of
the
room
and
frank
was
following
them
but
his
mother
called
him
back
when
is
it
to
be
frank
come
tell
me
something
about
it
i
never
asked
any
questions
when
i
thought
the
subject
was
a
painful
one
god
bless
you
mother
you
never
did
but
i
can
tell
you
nothing
only
the
stupid
old
earl
has
begged
me
to
go
there
at
once
fanny
must
settle
the
time
herself
there
be
settlements
and
lawyer
work
that
true
my
love
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
in
ready
cash
does
want
looking
after
but
look
here
my
dear
fanny
is
of
age
she
she
is
mother
well
now
frank
take
my
advice
they
want
to
tie
up
her
money
in
all
manner
of
ways
so
as
to
make
it
of
the
least
possible
use
to
you
or
to
her
either
they
always
do
they
never
contented
unless
they
lock
up
a
girl
money
so
that
neither
she
nor
her
husband
can
spend
the
principal
or
the
interest
do
let
them
do
it
frank
of
course
she
will
be
led
by
you
let
them
settle
whatever
is
fair
on
her
but
do
let
them
bother
the
money
so
that
you
ca
pay
off
the
debts
it
be
a
grand
thing
frank
to
redeem
the
property
frank
hemmed
and
hawed
and
said
he
consult
his
lawyer
in
dublin
before
the
settlements
were
signed
but
declared
that
he
was
not
going
to
marry
fanny
wyndham
for
her
money
that
all
very
well
frank
said
the
mother
but
you
know
you
could
not
marry
her
without
the
money
and
mind
it
now
or
never
think
what
a
thing
it
would
be
to
have
the
property
unencumbered
the
son
hurried
away
to
throw
himself
at
the
feet
of
his
mistress
and
the
mother
remained
in
her
thinking
with
delight
on
the
renovated
grandeur
of
the
family
and
of
the
decided
lead
which
the
would
again
be
able
to
take
in
connaught
fanny
joy
was
quite
equal
to
that
of
her
lover
but
it
was
not
shown
quite
so
openly
her
aunt
congratulated
her
most
warmly
kissed
her
twenty
times
called
her
her
own
dear
darling
niece
and
promised
her
to
love
her
husband
and
to
make
him
a
purse
if
she
could
get
griffiths
to
teach
her
that
new
stitch
it
looked
so
easy
she
was
sure
she
could
learn
it
and
it
would
tease
her
eyes
lady
selina
also
wished
her
joy
but
she
did
it
very
coldly
though
very
sensibly
believe
me
my
dear
fanny
i
am
glad
you
should
have
the
wish
of
your
heart
there
were
obstacles
to
your
union
with
lord
ballindine
which
appeared
to
be
insurmountable
and
i
therefore
attempted
to
wean
you
from
your
love
i
hope
he
will
prove
worthy
of
that
love
and
that
you
may
never
have
cause
to
repent
of
your
devotion
to
him
you
are
going
greatly
to
increase
your
cares
and
troubles
may
god
give
you
strength
to
bear
them
and
wisdom
to
turn
them
to
advantage
the
earl
made
a
very
long
speech
to
her
in
which
there
were
but
few
pauses
and
not
one
full
stop
fanny
was
not
now
inclined
to
quarrel
with
him
and
he
quite
satisfied
himself
that
his
conduct
throughout
towards
his
ward
had
been
dignified
prudent
consistent
and
disinterested
these
speeches
and
congratulations
all
occurred
during
the
period
of
mr
armstrong
visit
and
fanny
heard
nothing
more
about
her
lover
till
the
third
morning
after
that
gentleman
departure
the
earl
announced
then
on
entering
the
that
he
had
that
morning
received
a
communication
from
lord
ballindine
and
that
his
lordship
intended
reaching
grey
abbey
that
day
in
time
for
dinner
fanny
felt
herself
blush
but
she
said
nothing
lady
selina
regretted
that
he
had
had
a
very
wet
day
yesterday
and
hoped
he
would
have
a
fine
day
and
lady
cashel
was
overcome
at
the
reflection
that
she
had
no
one
to
meet
him
at
dinner
and
that
she
had
not
yet
suited
herself
with
a
cook
dear
me
exclaimed
her
ladyship
i
wish
we
got
this
letter
yesterday
no
one
knows
now
beforehand
when
people
are
coming
sure
it
use
to
be
so
i
shall
be
so
glad
to
see
lord
ballindine
you
know
fanny
he
was
always
a
great
favourite
of
mine
do
you
think
selina
the
would
mind
coming
again
without
any
notice
sure
i
do
know
i
would
not
for
the
world
treat
lord
ballindine
shabbily
but
what
can
i
do
my
dear
i
think
my
lady
we
may
dispense
with
any
ceremony
now
with
lord
ballindine
said
the
earl
he
will
i
am
sure
be
delighted
to
be
received
merely
as
one
of
the
family
you
need
not
mind
asking
the
do
you
think
not
well
that
a
great
comfort
besides
lord
ballindine
never
was
particular
but
still
fanny
had
i
known
he
was
coming
so
soon
i
would
have
had
murray
down
from
dublin
again
at
once
for
mrs
richards
is
not
a
good
cook
during
the
remainder
of
the
morning
fanny
was
certainly
very
happy
but
she
was
very
uneasy
she
hardly
knew
how
to
meet
lord
ballindine
she
felt
that
she
had
treated
him
badly
though
she
had
never
ceased
to
love
him
dearly
and
she
also
thought
she
owed
him
much
for
his
constancy
it
was
so
good
of
him
to
send
his
friend
to
her
and
one
to
whom
her
uncle
could
not
refuse
admission
and
then
she
thought
she
had
treated
mr
armstrong
haughtily
and
unkindly
she
had
never
thanked
him
for
all
the
trouble
he
had
taken
she
had
never
told
him
how
very
happy
he
had
made
her
but
she
would
do
so
at
some
future
time
when
he
should
be
an
honoured
and
a
valued
guest
in
her
own
and
her
house
but
how
should
she
receive
her
lover
would
they
allow
her
to
be
alone
with
him
if
only
for
a
moment
at
their
first
meeting
oh
how
she
longed
for
a
confidante
but
she
could
not
make
a
confidante
of
her
cousin
twice
she
went
down
to
the
with
the
intention
of
talking
of
her
love
but
lady
selina
looked
so
rigid
and
spoke
so
rigidly
that
she
could
not
do
it
she
said
such
things
and
spoke
of
lord
ballindine
exactly
as
she
would
of
any
other
visitor
who
might
have
been
coming
to
the
house
she
did
not
confine
herself
to
his
eating
and
drinking
as
her
mother
did
but
she
said
he
find
the
house
very
dull
she
was
afraid
especially
as
the
shooting
was
all
over
and
the
hunting
very
nearly
so
that
he
would
however
probably
be
a
good
deal
at
the
curragh
races
fanny
knew
that
her
cousin
did
not
mean
to
be
unkind
but
there
was
no
sympathy
in
her
she
could
not
talk
to
her
of
the
only
subject
which
occupied
her
thoughts
so
she
retreated
to
her
own
room
and
endeavoured
to
compose
herself
as
the
afternoon
drew
on
she
began
to
wish
that
he
was
not
coming
till
she
became
very
anxious
she
must
see
him
somewhere
before
she
dressed
for
dinner
and
she
would
not
could
not
bring
herself
to
go
down
into
the
and
shake
hands
with
him
when
he
came
before
her
uncle
her
aunt
and
her
cousin
she
was
still
pondering
on
the
subject
when
about
four
in
the
afternoon
she
got
a
message
from
her
aunt
desiring
her
to
go
to
her
in
her
boudoir
that
do
griffiths
said
the
countess
as
fanny
entered
her
room
you
can
come
up
when
i
ring
sit
down
fanny
sit
down
my
dear
i
was
thinking
lord
ballindine
will
soon
be
here
i
suppose
he
will
aunt
in
his
letter
to
lord
cashel
he
said
he
be
here
before
dinner
i
sure
he
be
here
soon
dear
me
i
so
glad
it
all
made
up
between
you
i
sure
fanny
i
hope
and
think
and
believe
you
be
very
very
happy
dear
aunt
and
fanny
kissed
lady
cashel
a
word
of
kindness
to
her
then
seemed
invaluable
it
was
so
very
proper
in
lord
ballindine
to
give
up
his
horses
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
said
the
countess
i
sure
i
always
said
he
turn
out
just
what
he
should
be
and
he
is
so
i
suppose
dear
you
go
abroad
the
first
thing
i
have
thought
of
that
yet
aunt
said
fanny
trying
to
smile
oh
of
course
you
will
you
go
to
the
rhine
and
switzerland
and
como
and
rome
and
those
sort
of
places
it
be
very
nice
we
went
there
your
uncle
and
i
and
it
was
delightful
only
i
used
to
be
very
tired
it
was
then
we
went
to
rome
though
i
remember
now
it
was
after
adolphus
was
born
poor
adolphus
and
her
ladyship
sighed
as
her
thoughts
went
back
to
the
miseries
of
her
eldest
born
but
tell
you
why
i
sent
for
you
my
dear
you
know
i
must
go
downstairs
to
receive
lord
ballindine
and
tell
him
how
glad
i
am
that
he
come
back
and
i
sure
i
am
very
glad
that
he
coming
and
your
uncle
will
be
there
but
i
was
thinking
you
perhaps
sooner
see
him
first
alone
you
be
a
little
flurried
my
dear
that
natural
so
if
you
like
you
can
remain
up
here
my
dear
in
my
room
quiet
and
comfortable
by
yourself
and
griffiths
shall
show
lord
ballindine
upstairs
as
soon
as
he
leaves
the
how
very
very
kind
of
you
dear
aunt
said
fanny
relieved
from
her
most
dreadful
difficulty
and
so
it
was
arranged
lady
cashel
went
down
into
the
to
await
her
guest
and
fanny
brought
her
book
into
her
aunt
boudoir
and
pretended
she
would
read
till
lord
ballindine
disturbed
her
i
need
hardly
say
that
she
did
not
read
much
she
sat
there
over
her
aunt
fire
waiting
to
catch
the
sound
of
the
wheels
on
the
gravel
at
the
front
door
at
one
moment
she
would
think
that
he
was
never
coming
the
time
appeared
to
be
so
long
and
then
again
when
she
heard
any
sound
which
might
be
that
of
his
approach
she
would
again
wish
to
have
a
few
minutes
more
to
herself
at
length
however
she
certainly
did
hear
him
there
was
the
quick
rattle
of
the
chaise
over
the
gravel
becoming
quicker
and
quicker
till
the
vehicle
stopped
with
that
kind
of
plunge
which
is
made
by
no
other
animal
than
a
and
by
him
only
at
his
arrival
at
the
end
of
a
stage
then
the
steps
were
let
down
with
a
crash
she
would
not
go
to
the
window
or
she
might
have
seen
him
she
longed
to
do
so
but
it
appeared
so
undignified
she
sat
quite
still
in
her
chair
but
she
heard
his
quick
step
at
the
hail
door
she
was
sure
she
could
have
sworn
to
his
step
and
then
she
heard
the
untying
of
cords
and
pulling
down
of
luggage
lord
ballindine
was
again
in
the
house
and
the
dearest
wish
of
her
heart
was
accomplished
she
felt
that
she
was
trembling
she
had
not
yet
made
up
her
mind
how
she
would
receive
him
what
she
would
first
say
to
him
and
certainly
she
had
no
time
to
do
so
now
she
got
up
and
looked
in
her
aunt
it
was
more
a
movement
of
instinct
than
one
of
premeditation
but
she
thought
she
had
never
seen
herself
look
so
wretchedly
she
had
however
but
little
time
either
for
regret
or
improvement
on
that
score
for
there
were
footsteps
in
the
corridor
he
could
have
stayed
a
moment
to
speak
to
anyone
downstairs
however
there
he
certainly
was
she
heard
griffiths
voice
in
the
passage
this
way
my
lord
in
my
lady
boudoir
and
then
the
door
opened
and
in
a
moment
she
was
in
her
lover
arms
my
own
fanny
once
more
my
own
oh
frank
dear
frank
lord
ballindine
was
only
ten
minutes
late
in
coming
down
to
dinner
and
miss
wyndham
not
about
half
an
hour
which
should
be
considered
as
showing
great
moderation
on
her
part
for
of
course
frank
kept
her
talking
a
great
deal
longer
than
he
should
have
done
and
then
she
not
only
had
to
dress
but
to
go
through
many
processes
with
her
eyes
to
obliterate
the
trace
of
tears
she
was
however
successful
for
she
looked
very
beautiful
when
she
came
down
and
so
dignified
so
composed
so
quiet
in
her
happiness
and
yet
so
very
happy
in
her
quietness
fanny
was
anything
but
a
hypocrite
she
had
hardly
a
taint
of
hypocrisy
in
her
composition
but
her
looks
seldom
betrayed
her
feelings
there
was
a
majesty
of
beauty
about
her
a
look
of
serenity
in
her
demeanour
which
in
public
made
her
appear
superior
to
all
emotion
frank
seemed
to
be
much
less
at
his
ease
he
attempted
to
chat
easily
with
the
countess
and
to
listen
pleasantly
to
the
witticisms
of
the
earl
but
he
was
not
comfortable
he
did
not
amalgamate
well
with
the
family
had
there
been
a
larger
party
he
could
have
talked
all
to
his
love
but
as
it
was
he
hardly
spoke
a
word
to
her
during
the
ceremony
and
indeed
but
few
during
the
evening
he
did
sit
next
to
her
on
the
sofa
to
be
sure
and
watched
the
lace
she
was
working
but
he
could
not
talk
unreservedly
to
her
when
old
lady
cashel
was
sitting
close
to
him
on
the
other
side
and
lady
selina
on
a
chair
immediately
opposite
and
then
it
is
impossible
to
talk
to
mistress
in
an
ordinary
voice
on
ordinary
subjects
when
one
has
not
seen
her
for
some
months
a
lover
is
never
so
badly
off
as
in
a
family
party
a
or
a
large
assembly
are
what
suit
him
best
he
is
equally
at
his
ease
in
either
but
he
is
completely
out
of
his
element
in
a
family
party
after
all
lady
cashel
was
right
it
would
have
been
much
better
to
have
asked
the
the
next
morning
frank
underwent
a
desperate
interview
in
the
his
head
was
dizzy
before
lord
cashel
had
finished
half
of
what
he
had
to
say
he
commenced
by
pointing
out
with
what
perfect
uprightness
and
wisdom
he
had
himself
acted
with
regard
to
his
ward
and
lord
ballindine
did
not
care
to
be
at
the
trouble
of
contradicting
him
he
then
went
to
the
subject
of
settlements
and
money
matters
professed
that
he
had
most
unbounded
confidence
in
his
young
liberality
integrity
and
good
feeling
that
he
would
be
glad
to
listen
and
he
had
no
doubt
to
accede
to
any
proposals
made
by
him
that
he
was
quite
sure
lord
ballindine
would
make
no
proposal
which
was
not
liberal
fair
and
most
proper
and
he
said
a
great
deal
more
of
the
kind
and
then
himself
proposed
to
arrange
his
ward
fortune
in
such
a
way
as
to
put
it
quite
beyond
her
future
husband
control
on
this
subject
however
frank
rather
nonplussed
the
earl
by
proposing
nothing
and
agreeing
to
nothing
but
simply
saying
that
he
would
leave
the
whole
matter
in
the
hands
of
the
lawyers
quite
right
my
lord
quite
right
said
lord
cashel
my
men
of
business
green
and
grogram
will
manage
all
that
they
know
all
about
fanny
property
they
can
draw
out
the
settlements
and
grogram
can
bring
them
here
and
we
can
execute
them
that
be
the
simplest
way
i
write
to
mr
cummings
then
and
tell
him
to
wait
on
green
and
grogram
cummings
is
a
very
proper
man
he
was
recommended
to
me
by
guinness
oh
ah
yes
your
attorney
you
mean
said
the
earl
why
yes
that
will
be
quite
proper
too
of
course
mr
cummings
will
see
the
necessity
of
absolutely
securing
miss
wyndham
fortune
nothing
further
however
was
said
between
them
on
the
subject
and
the
settlements
whatever
was
their
purport
were
drawn
out
without
any
visible
interference
on
the
part
of
lord
ballindine
but
mr
grogram
the
attorney
on
his
first
visit
to
grey
abbey
on
the
subject
had
no
difficulty
in
learning
that
miss
wyndham
was
determined
to
have
a
will
of
her
own
in
the
disposition
of
her
own
money
fanny
told
her
lover
the
whole
episode
of
lord
kilcullen
offer
to
her
but
she
told
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
redound
rather
to
her
credit
than
otherwise
she
had
learned
to
love
him
as
a
cousin
and
a
friend
and
his
proposal
to
her
had
not
destroyed
the
feeling
a
woman
can
rarely
be
really
offended
at
the
expression
of
love
unless
it
be
from
some
one
unfitted
to
match
with
her
either
in
rank
or
age
besides
fanny
thought
that
lord
kilcullen
had
behaved
generously
to
her
when
she
so
violently
repudiated
his
love
she
believed
that
it
had
been
sincere
she
had
not
even
to
herself
accused
him
of
meanness
or
treachery
and
she
spoke
of
him
as
one
to
be
pitied
liked
and
regarded
not
as
one
to
be
execrated
and
avoided
and
then
she
confessed
to
frank
all
her
fears
respecting
himself
how
her
heart
would
have
broken
had
he
taken
her
own
rash
word
as
final
and
so
deserted
her
she
told
him
that
she
had
never
ceased
to
love
him
for
a
day
not
even
on
that
day
when
in
her
foolish
spleen
she
had
told
her
uncle
she
was
willing
to
break
off
the
match
she
owned
to
him
all
her
troubles
all
her
doubts
how
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
write
to
him
but
had
not
dared
to
do
so
lest
his
answer
should
be
such
as
would
kill
her
at
once
and
then
she
prayed
to
be
forgiven
for
her
falseness
for
having
consented
even
for
a
moment
to
forget
the
solemn
vows
she
had
so
often
repeated
to
him
frank
stopped
her
again
and
again
in
her
sweet
confessions
and
swore
the
blame
was
only
his
he
anathematised
himself
his
horses
and
his
friends
for
having
caused
a
moment
uneasiness
to
her
but
she
insisted
on
receiving
his
forgiveness
and
he
was
obliged
to
say
that
he
forgave
her
with
all
his
follies
and
all
his
weakness
lord
ballindine
was
not
of
an
unforgiving
temperament
he
was
too
happy
to
be
angry
with
any
one
now
he
forgave
even
lord
cashel
and
had
he
seen
lord
kilcullen
he
would
have
been
willing
to
give
him
his
hand
as
to
a
brother
frank
spent
two
or
three
delightful
weeks
basking
in
the
sunshine
of
fanny
love
and
lord
cashel
favour
nothing
could
be
more
obsequiously
civil
than
the
earl
demeanour
now
that
the
matter
was
decided
every
thing
was
to
be
done
just
as
lord
ballindine
liked
his
taste
was
to
be
consulted
in
every
thing
the
earl
even
proposed
different
visits
to
the
curragh
asked
after
the
whereabouts
of
fin
and
brien
boru
and
condescended
pleasantly
to
inquire
whether
dot
blake
was
prospering
as
usual
with
his
favourite
amusement
at
length
the
day
was
fixed
for
the
marriage
it
was
to
be
in
the
pleasant
grateful
month
of
may
the
end
of
may
and
lord
and
lady
ballindine
were
then
to
start
for
a
summer
tour
as
the
countess
had
proposed
to
see
the
rhine
and
switzerland
and
rome
and
those
sort
of
places
and
now
invitations
were
sent
far
and
wide
to
relatives
and
friends
lord
cashel
had
determined
that
the
wedding
should
be
a
great
concern
the
ruin
of
his
son
was
to
be
forgotten
in
the
marriage
of
his
niece
the
bishop
of
maryborough
was
to
come
and
marry
them
the
ellisons
were
to
come
again
and
the
fitzgeralds
a
duchess
was
secured
though
duchesses
are
scarce
in
ireland
and
great
exertions
were
made
to
get
at
a
royal
prince
who
was
commanding
the
forces
in
the
west
but
the
royal
prince
did
not
see
why
he
should
put
himself
to
so
much
trouble
and
he
therefore
sent
to
say
that
he
was
very
sorry
but
the
peculiar
features
of
the
time
made
it
quite
impossible
for
him
to
leave
his
command
even
on
so
great
a
temptation
and
a
paragraph
consequently
found
its
way
into
the
papers
very
laudatory
of
his
royal
highness
military
energy
and
attention
mrs
and
her
daughters
received
a
very
warm
invitation
which
they
were
delighted
to
accept
sophy
and
augusta
were
in
the
seventh
heaven
of
happiness
for
they
were
to
form
a
portion
of
the
fair
bevy
of
bridesmaids
appointed
to
attend
fanny
wyndham
to
the
altar
frank
rather
pished
and
poohed
at
all
these
preparations
of
grandeur
he
felt
that
when
the
ceremony
took
place
he
would
look
like
the
ornamental
calf
in
the
middle
of
it
but
on
the
whole
he
bore
his
martyrdom
patiently
four
spanking
bays
and
a
new
chariot
ordered
from
hutton
on
the
occasion
would
soon
carry
him
away
from
the
worst
part
of
it
lord
cashel
was
in
the
midst
of
his
glory
he
had
got
an
occupation
and
he
delighted
in
it
lady
selina
performed
her
portion
of
the
work
with
exemplary
patience
and
attention
she
wrote
all
the
orders
to
the
tradesmen
and
all
the
invitations
she
even
condescended
to
give
advice
to
fanny
about
her
dress
and
to
griffiths
about
the
arrangement
of
the
rooms
and
tables
but
poor
lady
cashel
worked
the
hardest
of
all
her
troubles
had
no
end
had
she
known
what
she
was
about
to
encounter
when
she
undertook
the
task
of
superintending
the
arrangements
for
her
niece
wedding
she
would
never
have
attempted
it
she
would
never
have
entered
into
negotiations
with
that
treacherous
murray
that
man
cook
in
dublin
but
have
allowed
mrs
richards
to
have
done
her
best
or
her
worst
in
her
own
simple
way
in
spite
of
the
duchess
and
the
bishop
and
the
hopes
of
a
royal
prince
indulged
in
by
lord
cashel
she
did
not
dare
to
say
as
much
to
her
husband
but
she
confessed
to
griffiths
that
she
was
delighted
when
she
heard
his
royal
highness
would
not
come
she
was
sure
his
coming
would
not
make
dear
fanny
a
bit
happier
and
she
really
would
not
have
known
what
to
do
with
him
after
the
married
people
were
gone
frank
received
two
letters
from
dot
blake
during
his
stay
at
grey
abbey
in
the
former
he
warmly
congratulated
him
on
his
approaching
nuptials
and
strongly
commended
him
on
his
success
in
having
arranged
matters
you
never
could
have
forgiven
yourself
he
said
had
you
allowed
miss
wyndham
splendid
fortune
to
slip
through
your
hands
i
knew
you
were
not
the
man
to
make
a
vain
boast
of
a
girl
love
and
i
was
therefore
sure
that
you
might
rely
on
her
affection
i
only
feared
you
might
let
the
matter
go
too
far
you
know
i
strongly
advised
you
not
to
marry
twenty
thousand
pounds
i
am
as
strongly
of
opinion
that
you
would
be
a
fool
to
neglect
to
marry
six
times
as
much
you
see
i
still
confine
myself
to
the
money
part
of
the
business
as
though
the
lady
herself
were
of
no
value
i
do
think
so
however
only
i
know
you
never
would
have
lived
happily
without
an
easy
fortune
and
then
he
spoke
of
brien
boru
and
informed
lord
ballindine
that
that
now
celebrated
nag
was
at
the
head
of
the
list
of
the
derby
horses
that
it
was
all
but
impossible
to
get
any
odds
against
him
at
all
that
the
whole
betting
world
were
talking
of
nothing
else
that
three
conspiracies
had
been
detected
the
object
of
which
was
to
make
him
safe
that
is
to
make
him
very
unsafe
to
his
friends
that
foreman
had
been
offered
two
thousand
to
dose
him
and
that
scott
himself
slept
in
the
stable
with
him
every
night
to
prevent
anything
like
false
play
the
second
letter
was
written
by
dot
at
epsom
on
the
of
may
thirty
minutes
after
the
great
race
had
been
run
it
was
very
short
and
shall
therefore
be
given
entire
epsom
derby
day
race
just
over
god
bless
you
my
dear
boy
brien
has
done
the
trick
and
done
it
well
butler
rode
him
beautifully
but
he
did
not
want
any
riding
he
the
kindest
beast
ever
had
a
saddle
on
the
stakes
are
close
on
four
thousand
pounds
your
share
will
do
well
to
pay
the
posters
for
yourself
and
my
lady
on
your
wedding
trip
i
win
well
very
well
but
i
doubt
the
settling
we
shall
have
awful
faces
at
the
corner
next
week
you
probably
have
heard
all
about
it
by
express
before
you
get
this
in
greatest
haste
yours
blake
the
next
week
the
following
paragraph
appeared
in
bell
life
in
london
it
never
rains
but
it
pours
it
appears
pretty
certain
now
that
brien
boru
is
not
the
property
of
the
gentleman
in
whose
name
he
has
run
but
that
he
is
owned
by
a
certain
noble
lord
well
known
on
the
irish
turf
who
has
lately
however
been
devoting
his
time
to
pursuits
more
pleasant
and
more
profitable
than
the
cares
of
the
stable
pleasant
and
profitable
as
it
doubtless
must
be
to
win
the
best
race
of
the
year
the
on
the
derby
is
about
four
thousand
pounds
and
brien
boru
is
certainly
the
best
horse
of
his
year
but
lord
ballindine
matrimonial
is
we
are
told
a
clear
quarter
of
a
million
and
those
who
are
good
judges
declare
that
no
more
beautiful
woman
than
the
future
lady
ballindine
will
have
graced
the
english
court
for
many
a
long
year
his
lordship
on
the
whole
is
not
doing
badly
lord
cashel
also
congratulated
frank
on
his
success
on
the
turf
in
spite
of
the
very
decided
opinion
he
had
expressed
on
the
subject
when
he
was
endeavouring
to
throw
him
on
one
side
my
dear
ballindine
he
said
i
wish
you
joy
with
all
my
heart
a
most
magnificent
animal
i
told
is
brien
and
still
partly
your
own
property
you
say
well
it
a
great
triumph
to
beat
those
english
lads
on
their
own
ground
is
it
and
thorough
irish
blood
too
thorough
irish
blood
he
has
the
whack
strain
in
him
through
the
dam
the
very
best
blood
in
ireland
you
know
my
mare
that
won
the
oaks
in
was
by
out
of
by
whack
you
say
you
mean
to
give
up
the
turf
and
you
know
i
done
so
too
but
if
you
ever
do
change
your
mind
should
you
ever
run
horses
again
take
my
advice
and
stick
to
the
whack
strain
there
no
beating
the
real
blood
on
the
of
may
lord
ballindine
and
fanny
wyndham
were
married
the
bishop
turned
off
iligant
as
a
wag
said
in
the
servants
hall
there
was
a
long
account
of
the
affair
in
the
morning
post
of
the
day
there
were
eight
bridesmaids
all
of
whom
it
was
afterwards
remarked
were
themselves
married
within
two
years
of
the
time
an
omen
which
was
presumed
to
promise
much
continued
happiness
to
lord
and
lady
ballindine
and
all
belonging
to
them
murray
the
man
cook
did
come
down
from
dublin
just
in
time
but
he
behaved
very
badly
he
got
quite
drunk
on
the
morning
of
the
wedding
he
however
gave
richards
an
opportunity
of
immortalising
herself
she
behaved
on
the
trying
occasion
so
well
that
she
is
now
confirmed
in
her
situation
and
lady
cashel
has
solemnly
declared
that
she
will
never
again
on
any
account
be
persuaded
to
allow
a
man
cook
to
enter
the
house
lady
selina
she
would
not
officiate
as
one
of
the
bridesmaids
is
still
unmarried
but
her
temper
is
not
thereby
soured
nor
her
life
embittered
she
is
active
energetic
and
good
as
ever
and
as
ever
cold
hard
harsh
and
dignified
lord
kilcullen
has
hardly
been
heard
of
since
his
departure
from
grey
abbey
it
is
known
that
he
is
living
at
baden
but
no
one
knows
on
what
his
father
never
mentions
his
name
his
mother
sometimes
talks
of
poor
adolphus
but
if
he
were
dead
and
buried
he
could
not
give
less
trouble
to
the
people
of
grey
abbey
no
change
has
occurred
or
is
likely
to
take
place
in
the
earl
himself
nor
is
any
desirable
how
could
he
change
for
the
better
how
could
he
bear
his
honours
with
more
dignity
or
grace
his
high
position
with
more
decorum
every
year
since
the
marriage
of
his
niece
he
has
sent
lord
and
lady
ballindine
an
invitation
to
grey
abbey
but
there
has
always
been
some
insuperable
impediment
to
the
visit
a
child
had
just
been
born
or
was
just
going
to
be
born
or
mrs
was
ill
or
one
of
the
miss
was
going
to
be
married
it
was
very
unfortunate
but
lord
and
lady
ballindine
were
never
able
to
get
as
far
as
grey
abbey
great
improvements
have
been
effected
at
kelly
court
old
buildings
have
been
pulled
down
and
additions
built
up
a
great
many
thousand
young
trees
have
been
planted
and
some
miles
of
new
roads
and
walks
constructed
the
place
has
quite
an
altered
appearance
and
though
connaught
is
still
connaught
and
county
mayo
is
the
poorest
part
of
it
lady
ballindine
does
not
find
kelly
court
unbearable
she
has
three
children
already
and
doubtless
will
have
many
more
her
nursery
therefore
prevents
her
from
being
tormented
by
the
weariness
of
the
far
west
lord
ballindine
himself
is
very
happy
he
still
has
the
hounds
and
maintains
in
the
three
counties
round
him
the
sporting
which
has
for
so
many
years
belonged
to
his
family
but
he
has
no
his
friend
dot
purchased
the
lot
of
them
out
and
out
soon
after
the
famous
derby
and
a
very
good
bargain
for
himself
he
is
said
to
have
made
he
is
still
intimate
with
lord
ballindine
and
always
spends
a
fortnight
with
him
at
kelly
court
during
the
sophy
married
a
blake
and
augusta
married
a
dillon
and
as
they
both
live
within
ten
miles
of
kelly
court
and
their
husbands
are
related
to
all
the
blakes
and
all
the
dillons
and
as
ballindine
himself
is
the
head
of
all
the
kellys
there
is
a
rather
strong
clan
of
them
about
cousins
muster
together
in
red
coats
and
every
tuesday
and
friday
during
the
it
would
hardly
be
wise
in
that
country
to
quarrel
with
a
kelly
a
dillon
or
a
blake
xl
conclusion
we
must
now
return
to
dunmore
and
say
a
few
parting
words
of
the
kellys
and
anty
lynch
and
then
our
task
will
be
finished
it
will
be
remembered
that
that
demon
of
dunmore
barry
lynch
has
been
made
to
vanish
like
lord
kilcullen
he
has
gone
abroad
he
has
settled
himself
at
an
hotel
at
boulogne
and
is
determined
to
enjoy
himself
arrangements
have
been
made
about
the
property
certainly
not
very
satisfactory
to
barry
because
they
are
such
as
make
it
necessary
for
him
to
pay
his
own
debts
but
they
still
leave
him
sufficient
to
allow
of
his
indulging
in
every
vice
congenial
to
his
taste
and
if
he
does
get
fleeced
by
cleverer
rogues
than
himself
which
however
will
probably
be
the
case
he
will
have
quite
enough
to
last
him
till
he
has
drunk
himself
to
death
after
his
departure
there
was
nothing
to
delay
anty
marriage
but
her
own
rather
slow
recovery
she
has
no
other
relatives
to
ask
no
other
friends
to
consult
now
that
barry
was
gone
she
was
entirely
her
own
mistress
and
was
quite
willing
to
give
up
her
dominion
over
herself
to
martin
kelly
she
had
however
been
greatly
shaken
not
by
illness
only
but
by
fear
also
her
fears
of
barry
and
for
barry
she
still
dreamed
while
asleep
and
thought
while
awake
of
that
horrid
night
when
he
crept
up
to
her
room
and
swore
that
he
would
murder
her
this
and
what
she
had
suffered
since
had
greatly
weakened
her
and
it
was
some
time
before
doctor
colligan
would
pronounce
her
convalescent
at
last
however
the
difficulties
were
overcome
all
arrangements
were
completed
anty
was
well
the
property
was
settled
martin
was
impatient
and
the
day
was
fixed
there
was
no
bishop
no
duchess
no
at
the
given
on
the
occasion
by
mrs
kelly
nevertheless
it
was
in
its
way
quite
as
grand
an
affair
as
that
given
by
the
countess
the
widow
opened
her
heart
and
opened
her
house
her
great
enemy
barry
lynch
was
gone
clean
beaten
out
of
the
field
thoroughly
vanquished
as
far
as
ireland
was
concerned
annihilated
and
therefore
any
one
else
in
the
three
counties
was
welcome
to
share
her
hospitality
oh
the
excess
of
delight
the
widow
experienced
in
speaking
of
barry
to
one
of
her
gossips
as
the
poor
misfortunate
crature
daly
the
attorney
was
especially
invited
and
he
came
moylan
also
was
asked
but
he
stayed
away
doctor
colligan
was
there
in
great
feather
had
it
not
been
for
him
there
would
probably
have
been
no
wedding
at
all
it
would
have
been
a
great
thing
if
lord
ballindine
could
have
been
got
to
grace
the
party
though
only
for
ten
minutes
but
he
was
at
that
time
in
switzerland
with
his
own
bride
so
he
could
not
possibly
do
so
well
said
mrs
costelloe
the
grocer
wife
from
tuam
an
old
friend
of
the
widow
who
had
got
into
a
corner
with
her
to
have
a
little
chat
and
drink
of
porter
before
the
ceremony
and
i
shure
i
wish
you
joy
of
the
marriage
faux
i
tould
it
nigh
to
five
hundred
miss
anty

may
god
bless

incrase
it
well
martin
has
his
own
luck
but
he
desarves
it
he
desarves
it
i
do
know
so
much
about
luck
thin
mrs
costelloe
said
the
widow
who
still
professed
to
think
that
her
son
gave
quite
as
much
as
he
got
in
marrying
anty
lynch
i
do
know
so
much
about
luck
martin
was
very
well
as
he
was
his
poor
father
did
lave
him
that
way
that
he
need
be
looking
to
a
wife
for
mains
the
lord

praised
and
that
thrue
too
mrs
kelly
said
the
other
but
miss
fortune
ai
a
bad
step
to
a
young
man
neither
why
there
be
a
young
gintleman
within
tin
no
not
within
forty
miles
more
respectable
than
martin
kelly
that
is
regarding
mains
and
you
need
stop
there
neither
you
may
say
the
very
same
regarding
characther
too
and
family
too
glory
be
to
the
virgin
like
to
know
where
some
of
their
ancesthers
wor
when
the
kellys

ould

for
you
my

know
indeed

good
characther
but
is
it
thrue
mrs
kelly
that
martin
will
live
up
in
the
big
house
yonder
where
should
a
man
live
thin
mrs
costelloe
when
he
gets
married
but
jist
in
his
own
house
why
for
should
he
not
live
there
that
thrue
agin
to
be
shure
but
yet
only
to
think
martin
living
in
ould
sim
lynch

house
i
wondther
what

av
he

the
thruth
he
say
there
was
an
honest
man

wor
niver
the
case
as
long
as
any
of
his
own
breed
was
in
it
barring
anty
i
main
she
honest
and
thrue
the
lord
be
good
to
her
the
poor
thing
but
the
not
to
your
liking
mrs
costelloe
you
not
tasting
it
at
all
this
morning
no
one
could
have
been
more
humble
and
meek
than
was
anty
herself
in
the
midst
of
her
happiness
she
had
no
idea
of
taking
on
herself
the
airs
of
a
fine
lady
or
the
importance
of
an
heiress
she
had
no
wish
to
be
thought
a
lady
she
had
no
wish
for
other
friends
than
those
of
her
husband
and
his
family
she
had
never
heard
of
her
brother
last
horrible
proposal
to
doctor
colligan
and
of
the
manner
in
which
his
consent
to
her
marriage
had
been
obtained
nor
did
martin
intend
that
she
should
hear
it
she
had
merely
been
told
that
her
brother
had
found
that
it
was
for
his
advantage
to
leave
the
neighbourhood
altogether
that
he
had
given
up
all
claim
to
the
house
and
that
his
income
was
to
be
sent
to
him
by
a
person
appointed
in
the
neighbourhood
to
receive
it
anty
however
before
signing
her
own
settlement
was
particularly
careful
that
nothing
should
be
done
injurious
to
her
interest
and
that
no
unfair
advantage
should
be
taken
of
his
absence
martin
too
was
quiet
enough
on
the
occasion
it
was
arranged
that
he
and
his
wife
and
at
any
rate
one
of
his
sisters
should
live
at
dunmore
house
and
that
he
should
keep
in
his
own
hands
the
farm
near
dunmore
which
old
sim
had
held
as
well
as
his
own
farm
at
toneroe
but
to
tell
the
truth
martin
felt
rather
ashamed
of
his
grandeur
he
would
much
have
preferred
building
a
nice
snug
little
house
of
his
own
on
the
land
he
held
under
lord
ballindine
but
he
was
told
that
he
would
be
a
fool
to
build
a
house
on
another
man
ground
when
he
had
a
very
good
one
ready
built
on
his
own
he
gave
way
to
such
good
advice
but
he
did
not
feel
at
all
happy
at
the
idea
and
when
going
up
to
the
house
always
felt
an
inclination
to
shirk
in
at
the
but
though
neither
the
widow
nor
martin
triumphed
aloud
at
their
worldly
prosperity
the
two
girls
made
up
for
their
quiescence
they
were
full
of
nothing
else
their
brother
fine
house
anty
great
fortune
their
wealth
prosperity
and
future
station
and
happiness
gave
them
subjects
of
delightful
conversation
among
their
friends
meg
moreover
boasted
that
it
was
all
her
own
doing
that
it
was
she
who
had
made
up
the
match
that
martin
would
never
have
thought
of
it
but
for
her
nor
anty
either
for
the
matter
of
that
and
will
your
mother
be
staying
down
at
the
shop
always
the
same
as
iver
said
matilda
nolan
the
daughter
of
the
innkeeper
at
tuam
she
says
so
then
said
jane
in
a
tone
of
disappointment
for
her
mother
pertinacity
in
adhering
to
the
counter
was
at
present
the
one
misery
of
her
life
and
which
of
you
will
be
staying
here
along
with
her
dears
said
matilda
she
be
wanting
one
of
you
to
be
with
her
any
ways
oh
turn
about
i
suppose
said
jane
she
not
get
much
of
my
company
any
way
said
meg
i
had
enough
of
the
nasty
place
and
now
martin
has
a
dacent
house
to
put
over
our
heads
and
mainly
through
my
mains
i
may
say
i
do
see
why
i
to
be
mewing
myself
up
in
such
a
hole
as
this
there
room
for
her
up
in
dunmore
house
and
wilcome
too
let
her
come
up
there
av
she
mains
to
demain
herself
by
sticking
down
here
she
may
stay
by
herself
for
me
but
you
take
your
turn
meg
said
jane
it
be
a
very
little
turn
then
said
meg
i
sick
of
the
nasty
ould
place
fancy
coming
down
here
matilda
to
the
tobacco
and
sugar
after
living
up
there
a
month
or
so
with
everything
nice
and
comfortable
and
it
only
mother
whims
for
she
do
want
the
shop
anty
begged
and
prayed
of
her
for
to
come
and
live
at
dunmore
house
for
good
and
all
but
no
she
says
she
never
live
in
any
one
house
that
is
her
own
i
not
so
any
way
said
jane
i
be
glad
enough
to
live
in
another
person
house
av
i
liked
it
i
go
bail
you
would
my
dear
said
matilda
willing
enough
especially
john
dolan
oh
av
i
iver
live
in
that
it
be
partly
my
own
you
know
and
a
girl
might
do
worse
that
thrue
dear
said
matilda
but
john
dolan
not
so
soft
as
to
take
any
girl
just
as
she
stands
what
does
your
mother
say
about
the
money
part
of
the
business
and
so
the
two
friends
put
their
heads
together
to
arrange
another
wedding
if
possible
martin
and
anty
did
not
go
to
visit
switzerland
or
rome
as
soon
as
they
were
married
but
they
took
a
at
renvill
near
galway
and
with
much
difficulty
persuaded
mrs
kelly
to
allow
both
her
daughters
to
accompany
them
and
very
merry
they
all
were
anty
soon
became
a
different
creature
from
what
she
ever
had
been
she
learned
to
be
happy
and
gay
to
laugh
and
enjoy
the
sunshine
of
the
world
she
had
always
been
kind
to
others
and
now
she
had
round
her
those
who
were
kind
and
affectionate
to
her
her
manner
of
life
was
completely
changed
indeed
life
itself
was
an
altered
thing
to
her
it
was
so
new
to
her
to
have
friends
to
be
loved
to
be
one
of
a
family
who
regarded
and
looked
up
to
her
she
hardly
knew
herself
in
her
new
happiness
they
returned
to
dunmore
in
the
early
autumn
and
took
up
their
residence
at
sim
lynch
big
house
as
had
been
arranged
martin
was
very
shy
about
it
it
was
long
before
he
talked
about
it
as
his
house
or
his
ground
or
his
farm
and
it
was
long
before
he
could
find
himself
quite
at
home
in
his
own
parlour
many
attempts
were
made
to
induce
the
widow
to
give
up
the
inn
and
shift
her
quarters
to
the
big
house
but
in
vain
she
declared
that
ould
as
she
was
she
would
think
of
making
herself
throublesome
to
young
folks
who
afther
a
bit
would
a
dail
sooner
have
her
room
than
her
company
that
she
had
always
been
misthress
and
mostly
masther
too
in
her
own
house
glory
be
to
god
and
that
she
meant
to
be
so
still
and
that
poor
as
the
place
was
she
meant
to
call
it
her
own
she
did
think
herself
at
all
fit
company
for
people
who
lived
in
grand
houses
and
had
their
own
demesnes
and
gardens
and
the
rest
of
it
she
had
always
lived
where
money
was
to
be
made
and
she
see
the
sense
of
going
in
her
old
age
to
a
place
where
the
only
work
would
be
how
to
spend
it
some
folks
would
find
it
was
a
dail
asier
to
scatther
it
than
it
wor
to
put
it
together
all
this
she
said
and
a
great
deal
more
which
had
her
character
not
been
known
would
have
led
people
to
believe
that
her
son
was
a
spendthrift
and
that
he
and
anty
were
commencing
life
in
an
expensive
way
and
without
means
but
then
the
widow
kelly
known
and
her
speeches
were
only
taken
at
their
value
she
so
far
relaxed
however
that
she
spent
every
sunday
at
the
house
on
which
occasions
she
invariably
dressed
herself
with
all
the
grandeur
she
was
able
to
display
and
passed
the
whole
afternoon
sitting
on
a
sofa
with
her
hands
before
her
trying
to
look
as
became
a
lady
enjoying
herself
in
a
fine
her
sundays
were
certainly
not
the
comfort
to
her
which
they
had
been
when
spent
at
the
inn
but
they
made
her
enjoy
with
a
keener
relish
the
feeling
of
perfect
sovereignty
when
she
returned
to
her
own
domains
i
have
nothing
further
to
tell
of
mr
and
mrs
kelly
i
believe
doctor
colligan
has
been
once
called
in
on
an
interesting
occasion
if
not
twice
so
it
is
likely
that
dunmore
house
will
not
be
left
without
an
heir
i
have
also
learned
on
inquiry
that
margaret
and
jane
kelly
have
both
arranged
their
own
affairs
to
their
own
satisfaction
