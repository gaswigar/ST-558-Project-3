against
one

a
small
bundle

gestures
with
her
hands

fixed
up
the

for
him
a
deteckative
like

so
bad
as
that
he
was
followed
by
a
large
and
growing
group
intent
on
watching
a
detective
detect
philo
gubb
the
detective
the
egg
walking
close
along
the
wall
to
avoid
the
creaking
floor
boards
philo
gubb
and
student
of
the
rising
sun
detective
agency
correspondence
school
of
detecting
tiptoed
to
the
door
of
the
bedroom
he
shared
with
the
mysterious
critz
in
appearance
gubb
was
tall
and
gaunt
reminding
one
of
a
modern
don
quixote
or
a
human
flamingo
by
nature
gubb
was
the
gentlest
and
most
of
men
now
bending
his
long
angular
body
almost
double
he
placed
his
eye
to
a
crack
in
the
door
panel
and
stared
into
the
room
within
just
out
of
the
limited
area
of
gubb
vision
roscoe
critz
paused
in
his
work
and
listened
carefully
he
heard
the
sharp
whistle
of
gubb
breath
as
it
cut
against
the
sharp
edge
of
the
crack
in
the
panel
and
he
knew
he
was
being
spied
upon
he
placed
his
chubby
hands
on
his
knees
and
smiled
at
the
door
while
a
red
flush
of
triumph
spread
over
his
face
through
the
crack
in
the
door
gubb
could
see
the
top
of
the
washstand
beside
which
critz
was
sitting
but
he
could
not
see
critz
as
he
stared
however
he
saw
a
plump
hand
appear
and
pick
up
one
by
one
the
articles
lying
on
the
washstand
they
were
first
seven
or
eight
half
shells
of
english
walnuts
second
a
rubber
shoe
heel
out
of
which
a
piece
had
been
cut
third
a
small
rubber
ball
no
larger
than
a
pea
fourth
a
book
and
lastly
a
large
and
glittering
brick
of
yellow
gold
as
the
hand
withdrew
the
golden
brick
gubb
pressed
his
face
closer
against
the
door
in
his
effort
to
see
more
and
suddenly
the
door
flew
open
and
gubb
sprawled
on
his
hands
and
knees
on
the
worn
carpet
of
the
bedroom
there
now
said
critz
there
now
serves
you
right
hope
you
hurt
chuself
gubb
arose
slowly
like
a
giraffe
and
brushed
his
knees
why
he
asked
snoopin
an
sneakin
like
that
said
critz
crossly
scarin
me
to
fits
how
i
know
who
was
if
you
want
to
come
in
why
do
you
come
right
in
of
snoopin
an
sneakin
an
in
that
way
as
he
talked
critz
replaced
the
shells
and
the
rubber
heel
and
the
rubber
pea
and
the
on
the
washstand
he
was
a
plump
little
man
with
a
shiny
bald
head
and
a
white
goatee
as
he
talked
he
bent
his
head
down
so
that
he
might
look
above
the
glasses
of
his
spectacles
and
in
spite
of
his
pretended
anger
he
looked
like
nothing
so
much
as
a
kindly
benevolent
old
gentleman
the
sort
of
old
gentleman
that
keeps
a
small
store
in
a
small
village
and
sells
that
smells
of
soap
and
candy
sticks
out
of
a
glass
jar
with
a
glass
cover
how
i
know
but
what
you
was
a
detective
he
asked
in
a
gentler
tone
i
am
said
gubb
soberly
seating
himself
on
one
of
the
two
beds
i
putty
near
a
deteckative
as
you
might
say
ding
it
all
said
critz
now
i
got
to
go
and
hunt
another
room
i
ca
room
with
no
detective
well
now
critz
said
gubb
i
do
want
you
should
feel
that
way
knowin
you
are
a
detective
makes
me
all
nervous
complained
critz
and
a
man
in
my
business
has
to
have
a
steady
hand
do
he
you
ai
told
me
what
your
business
is
said
gubb
you
need
pretend
you
do
know
said
critz
any
detective
that
saw
that
stuff
on
the
washstand
would
know
well
of
course
said
gubb
i
ai
a
full
deteckative
yet
you
ca
look
for
me
to
guess
things
as
quick
as
a
full
deteckative
would
of
course
that
brick
sort
of
looks
like
a
it
a
said
critz
yes
said
gubb
but
i
do
mean
no
offense
critz
from
the
way
you
look
i
sort
of
thought
well
that
it
was
a
you
bought
critz
turned
very
red
well
what
if
i
did
buy
it
he
said
that
ai
any
reason
i
sell
it
is
it
just
because
a
man
buys
eggs
once
or
twice
ai
any
reason
he
should
go
into
the
business
of
is
it
just
because
i
bought
one
or
two
in
my
day
ai
any
reason
i
should
go
to
sellin
is
it
gubb
stared
at
critz
with
unconcealed
surprise
you
ai
you
ai
a
con
man
are
you
mr
critz
he
asked
if
i
ai
yet
that
no
sign
i
ai
goin
to
be
said
critz
firmly
one
man
has
as
good
a
right
to
try
his
hand
at
it
as
another
especially
when
a
man
has
had
my
experience
in
it
gubb
there
ai
hardly
a
con
game
i
ai
been
conned
with
i
been
confidenced
long
enough
from
now
on
i
goin
to
confidence
other
folks
what
i
goin
to
do
and
i
wo
be
bothered
by
no
detective
in
the
same
room
with
me
detectives
and
con
men
do
mix
noways
no
sir
well
sir
said
gubb
i
can
see
the
sense
of
that
but
you
do
need
to
move
right
away
i
do
aim
to
start
in
deteckating
in
earnest
for
a
couple
of
months
yet
i
got
a
couple
of
jobs
of
and
decorating
to
finish
up
and
i
ca
start
in
sleuthing
until
i
get
my
star
anyway
and
i
do
get
my
star
until
i
get
one
more
lesson
and
learn
it
and
send
in
the
examination
paper
and
five
dollars
extra
for
the
diploma
then
i
goin
at
it
as
a
business
it
a
good
business
every
day
there
more
crooks
excuse
me
i
did
mean
to
say
that
that
all
right
said
critz
kindly
call
a
spade
a
spade
if
i
ai
a
crook
yet
i
hope
to
be
soon
i
did
know
how
you
feel
about
it
explained
gubb
tactfulness
is
strongly
advised
into
the
lessons
of
the
rising
sun
deteckative
agency
correspondence
school
of
deteckating
slocum
ohio
asked
critz
quickly
you
did
see
the
ad
in
the
and
farmside
did
you
yes
slocum
ohio
said
gubb
and
that
is
the
paper
i
saw
the
ad
into
money
in
deteckating
be
a
sleuth
we
can
make
you
the
equal
of
sherlock
holmes
in
twelve
lessons
why
well
sir
said
critz
that
funny
that
ad
was
right
atop
of
the
one
i
saw
and
i
studied
quite
considerable
before
i
could
make
up
my
mind
whether
be
best
for
me
to
be
a
detective
and
go
out
and
get
square
with
the
fellers
that
sold
me
and
things
by
putting
them
in
jail
or
to
even
things
up
by
sending
for
this
book
that
was
advertised
right
under
the
sun
correspondence
school
how
come
i
settled
to
do
as
i
done
was
that
i
had
a
sort
of
stock
to
start
with
with
a
and
some
green
goods
i
bought
and
this
book
only
cost
a
quatter
of
a
dollar
and
she
a
hummer
for
a
quatter
of
a
dollar
a
hummer
he
pulled
the
book
from
his
pocket
and
handed
it
to
gubb
the
title
of
the
book
was
the
complete
con
man
by
the
king
of
the
grafters
price
cents
that
there
book
said
critz
proudly
as
if
he
himself
had
written
it
tells
everything
a
man
need
to
know
to
work
every
game
there
is
once
i
get
it
by
heart
i
wo
be
afraid
to
try
any
of
them
of
course
i
got
to
start
in
small
i
ca
hope
to
pull
off
a
game
right
at
the
start
because
that
has
to
have
a
gang
you
do
know
anybody
you
could
recommend
for
a
gang
do
you
not
right
offhand
said
gubb
thoughtfully
illustration
this
shell
game
is
easy
enough
when
you
know
how
if
you
was
goin
into
the
detective
business
said
critz
you
be
just
the
feller
for
me
you
look
sort
of
honest
and
not
as
if
you
was
too
bright
and
that
counts
a
lot
even
in
this
here
simple
little
shell
game
i
got
to
have
a
podner
i
got
to
have
a
podner
i
can
trust
so
i
can
let
him
look
like
he
was
winnin
money
off
of
me
you
see
he
explained
moving
to
the
washstand
this
shell
game
is
easy
enough
when
you
know
how
i
put
three
shells
down
like
this
on
a
stand
and
i
put
the
little
rubber
pea
on
the
stand
and
then
i
take
up
the
three
shells
like
this
two
in
one
hand
and
one
in
the
other
and
i
wave
around
over
the
pea
and
maybe
push
the
pea
around
a
little
and
i
say
on
come
on
the
hand
is
quicker
than
the
eye
and
all
of
a
suddent
i
put
the
shells
down
and
you
think
the
pea
is
under
one
of
them
like
that
i
do
think
the
pea
is
under
one
of
said
gubb
i
seen
it
roll
onto
the
floor
it
did
roll
onto
the
floor
that
time
said
critz
apologetically
it
most
generally
does
for
me
yet
i
ai
got
it
down
to
perfection
yet
this
is
the
way
it
ought
to
work
oh
pshaw
there
she
goes
onto
the
floor
again
went
under
the
bed
that
time
here
she
is
now
the
way
she
ought
to
work
is
there
she
goes
again
you
got
to
practice
that
game
a
lot
before
you
try
it
onto
folks
in
public
critz
said
gubb
seriously
do
i
know
that
said
critz
rather
impatiently
same
as
you
got
to
practice
snoopin
gubb
maybe
you
thought
i
know
you
was
snoopin
after
me
wherever
i
went
last
night
did
you
asked
gubb
with
surprise
plainly
written
on
his
face
i
seen
you
every
moment
from
nine
till
eleven
said
critz
i
did
like
it
neither
i
did
think
to
annoy
you
apologized
gubb
i
was
lesson
four
you
was
supposed
to
know
i
was
there
at
all
well
i
do
like
it
said
critz
was
all
right
last
night
for
i
did
have
nothin
important
on
hand
but
if
i
been
up
a
con
game
the
feller
i
was
after
would
have
thought
it
mighty
strange
to
see
a
man
follerin
me
everywhere
like
that
if
you
went
about
it
quiet
and
unobtrusive
i
would
mind
but
if
i
had
a
customer
on
hand
and
he
seen
you
it
would
make
him
nervous
think
there
was
a
a
crazy
man
follerin
us
i
was
just
practicin
apologized
gubb
it
wo
be
so
bad
when
i
get
the
hang
of
it
we
all
got
to
be
beginners
sometime
i
guess
so
said
critz
rearranging
the
shells
and
the
little
rubber
pea
well
i
put
the
pea
down
like
this
and
i
dare
you
to
bet
which
shell
she
goin
to
be
under
and
you
do
bet
see
so
i
put
the
shells
down
and
you
willin
to
bet
you
see
me
put
the
first
shell
over
the
pea
like
this
so
you
keep
your
eye
on
that
shell
and
i
move
the
shells
around
like
this
she
under
the
same
shell
said
gubb
well
yes
she
said
critz
placidly
but
she
had
ought
to
be
by
rights
she
ought
to
sort
of
ooze
out
from
under
whilst
movin
the
shells
around
and
i
ought
to
sort
of
catch
her
in
between
my
fingers
and
hold
her
there
so
you
do
see
her
then
when
you
say
which
shell
she
under
she
ai
under
any
shell
between
my
fingers
so
when
you
put
down
your
money
i
tell
you
to
pick
up
that
shell
and
there
ai
anything
under
it
and
before
you
can
pick
up
the
other
shells
i
pick
one
up
and
let
the
pea
fall
on
the
stand
like
it
had
been
under
that
shell
all
the
time
that
the
game
only
up
to
now
i
ai
got
the
hang
of
it
she
wo
ooze
out
from
under
and
she
wo
stick
between
my
fingers
and
when
she
does
stick
she
wo
drop
at
the
right
time
except
for
that
you
got
her
all
right
have
you
asked
gubb
except
for
that
said
critz
and
i
have
that
only
my
fingers
are
stubby
what
was
it
you
thought
of
having
me
do
if
i
was
a
deteckative
asked
gubb
the
work
you
have
to
do
would
be
capping
work
said
critz
capper
that
the
professional
name
for
it
you
guess
which
shell
the
ball
was
under
that
would
be
easy
the
way
you
do
it
now
said
gubb
i
told
you
i
got
to
learn
it
better
did
i
asked
critz
impatiently
you
be
capper
and
you
guess
which
shell
the
pea
was
under
no
matter
which
you
guessed
i
leave
it
under
that
one
you
win
and
you
win
ten
dollars
every
time
you
bet
but
not
for
keeps
that
why
i
got
to
have
an
honest
capper
i
can
see
that
said
gubb
but
what
the
use
lettin
me
win
it
if
i
got
to
bring
it
back
that
starts
the
boobs
bettin
said
critz
the
boobs
see
how
you
look
to
be
winnin
and
they
want
to
win
too
but
they
do
when
they
bet
i
win
that
ai
a
square
game
said
gubb
seriously
is
it
a
crook
ai
expected
to
be
square
said
critz
it
stands
to
reason
if
a
crook
wants
to
be
a
crook
he
got
to
be
crooked
he
yes
of
course
said
gubb
i
had
looked
at
it
that
way
as
far
as
i
can
see
said
critz
the
more
i
know
how
a
detective
acts
the
better
off
i
be
when
i
start
in
doin
real
business
ai
that
so
i
guess
till
i
get
the
hang
of
things
better
i
stay
right
here
i
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
critz
said
gubb
with
relief
i
like
you
and
i
like
your
looks
and
there
no
tellin
who
i
might
get
for
a
roommate
next
time
i
might
get
some
one
that
honest
so
it
was
agreed
and
critz
stood
over
the
washstand
and
manipulated
the
little
rubber
pea
and
the
three
shells
while
gubb
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
studied
lesson
eleven
of
the
rising
sun
detective
agency
correspondence
school
of
detecting
when
presently
critz
learned
to
work
the
little
pea
neatly
he
urged
gubb
to
take
the
part
of
capper
and
each
time
gubb
won
he
gave
him
a
bill
then
gubb
posed
as
a
boob
and
critz
won
all
the
money
back
again
beaming
over
his
spectacle
rims
and
chuckling
again
and
again
until
he
burst
into
a
fit
of
coughing
that
made
him
red
in
the
face
and
did
not
cease
until
he
had
taken
a
big
drink
of
water
out
of
the
never
had
he
seemed
more
like
a
kindly
old
gentleman
from
behind
the
candy
counter
of
a
small
village
he
hung
over
the
washstand
manipulating
the
little
rubber
pea
as
if
fascinated
ai
it
curyus
how
a
feller
catches
onto
a
thing
like
that
all
to
once
he
said
after
a
while
if
it
had
been
that
i
was
so
anxious
i
might
have
fooled
with
that
for
weeks
and
weeks
and
not
got
anywheres
with
it
i
do
wisht
you
could
be
my
capper
a
while
anyway
until
i
could
get
one
i
need
all
my
time
to
study
said
gubb
it
ai
easy
to
learn
deteckating
by
mail
pshaw
now
said
critz
i
real
sorry
maybe
if
i
was
to
pay
you
for
your
time
and
trouble
five
dollars
a
night
how
say
gubb
considered
well
i
dunno
he
said
slowly
i
sort
of
hate
to
take
money
for
doin
a
favor
like
that
now
there
ai
no
need
to
feel
that
way
said
critz
your
time
wuth
somethin
to
me
it
wuth
a
lot
to
me
to
get
the
hang
of
this
game
once
i
get
the
hang
of
it
it
wo
be
no
trouble
for
me
to
sell
like
this
one
for
all
the
way
from
a
thousand
dollars
up
i
paid
fifteen
hundred
for
this
one
myself
and
got
it
cheap
that
a
good
profit
for
this
brick
ai
wuth
a
cent
over
one
hundred
dollars
and
i
know
for
i
took
it
to
the
bank
after
i
bought
it
and
that
what
they
was
willin
to
pay
me
for
it
so
it
easy
wuth
a
few
dollars
for
me
to
have
help
whilst
i
learnin
i
can
easy
afford
to
pay
you
a
few
dollars
and
to
pay
a
friend
of
yours
the
same
well
now
said
gubb
i
do
know
but
what
i
might
as
well
make
a
little
that
way
as
any
other
i
got
a
friend
he
stopped
short
you
do
aim
to
the
to
him
do
you
critz
eyes
opened
wide
behind
their
spectacles
land
sakes
no
he
said
well
i
got
a
friend
may
be
willing
to
help
out
said
gubb
what
he
have
to
do
you
or
him
said
critz
would
be
the
and
pretend
to
buy
the
brick
and
you
or
him
would
pretend
to
help
me
to
sell
it
maybe
you
better
have
the
brick
because
you
can
look
stupid
and
the
feller
that
got
the
brick
has
got
to
look
that
i
can
look
anyway
said
gubb
with
pride
do
tell
said
critz
and
so
it
was
arranged
that
the
first
rehearsal
of
the
game
should
take
place
the
next
evening
but
as
gubb
turned
away
critz
deftly
slipped
something
into
the
student
detective
coat
pocket
it
was
toward
noon
the
next
day
that
critz
peering
over
his
spectacles
and
avoiding
as
best
he
could
the
pails
of
paste
entered
the
parlor
of
the
vacant
house
where
gubb
was
at
work
i
just
come
around
said
critz
rather
reluctantly
to
say
you
better
not
say
nothing
to
your
friend
i
guess
that
deal
off
pshaw
now
said
gubb
you
do
mean
so
i
do
mean
nothing
in
the
way
of
aspersions
you
mind
said
critz
with
reluctance
but
i
guess
we
better
call
it
off
of
course
so
far
as
i
know
you
are
all
right
i
do
know
what
you
gettin
at
said
gubb
why
do
you
say
it
well
i
been
buncoed
so
often
said
critz
seem
like
any
one
can
get
money
from
me
any
time
and
any
way
and
i
got
to
thinkin
it
over
i
do
know
anything
about
you
do
i
and
here
i
am
going
to
give
you
a
that
cost
me
fifteen
hundred
dollars
and
let
you
go
out
and
wait
until
i
come
for
it
with
your
friend
and
well
what
to
stop
you
from
just
goin
away
with
that
brick
and
never
comin
back
gubb
looked
at
critz
blankly
i
went
and
told
my
friend
he
said
he
all
ready
to
start
in
i
hate
it
to
have
to
say
it
said
critz
but
when
i
come
to
count
over
them
bills
i
lent
you
to
cap
the
shell
game
with
there
was
a
one
short
i
know
said
gubb
turning
red
and
if
you
go
over
there
to
my
coat
you
find
it
in
my
pocket
all
ready
to
hand
back
to
you
i
do
know
how
i
come
to
keep
it
in
my
pocket
must
ha
missed
it
when
i
handed
you
back
the
rest
well
i
had
a
notion
it
was
that
way
said
critz
kindly
you
look
like
you
was
honest
gubb
but
a
that
any
bank
will
pay
a
hundred
dollars
for
i
got
to
get
out
of
this
way
of
trustin
everybody
critz
was
evidently
distressed
if
was
anybody
else
but
you
he
said
with
an
effort
i
make
him
put
up
a
hundred
dollars
to
cover
the
cost
of
a
brick
like
that
whilst
he
had
it
there
i
said
it
and
i
guess
you
mad
i
ai
mad
protested
gubb
as
you
goin
to
pay
me
and
pete
and
it
business
i
ai
so
set
against
puttin
up
what
the
brick
is
worth
critz
heaved
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
you
do
know
how
good
that
makes
me
feel
he
said
i
was
almost
losin
what
faith
in
mankind
i
had
left
gubb
ate
his
frugal
evening
meals
at
the
pie
wagon
on
willow
street
just
off
main
where
by
day
pete
dispensed
light
viands
and
pete
was
the
friend
he
had
invited
to
share
critz
generosity
the
seal
of
secrecy
had
been
put
on
pete
lips
before
gubb
offered
him
the
opportunity
to
accept
or
decline
and
when
gubb
stopped
for
his
evening
meal
pete
now
off
duty
was
waiting
for
him
the
story
of
critz
and
his
amateur
con
business
had
amused
pete
he
could
hardly
believe
such
utter
innocence
existed
perhaps
he
did
not
believe
it
existed
for
he
had
come
from
the
city
and
he
had
had
shady
companions
before
he
landed
in
riverbank
he
was
a
fellow
with
a
hard
fist
and
a
scar
across
his
face
and
when
gubb
had
told
him
of
critz
and
his
affairs
he
had
seen
an
opportunity
to
shear
a
country
lamb
how
goes
it
for
philo
he
asked
gubb
taking
the
stool
next
to
gubb
while
the
night
man
drew
a
cup
of
coffee
quite
well
said
gubb
everything
is
arranged
satisfactory
to
be
on
the
old
by
the
on
the
levee
at
nine
with
he
glanced
at
the
night
man
back
and
lowered
his
voice
and
critz
will
bring
you
there
nine
eh
said
i
meet
him
at
your
room
do
i
you
meet
him
at
the
riverbank
hotel
at
said
gubb
like
it
was
the
real
thing
i
goin
over
to
my
room
now
and
give
him
the
money
what
money
asked
pete
quickly
well
you
see
said
gubb
he
sort
of
hated
to
trust
the
trust
out
of
his
hands
without
a
deposit
it
the
only
one
he
has
so
i
thought
i
put
up
a
hundred
dollars
he
all
right
oh
sure
said
a
hundred
dollars
eh
he
looked
at
gubb
who
was
eating
a
piece
of
apple
pie
fashion
and
studied
him
in
a
new
light
one
hundred
dollars
eh
he
repeated
thoughtfully
you
give
him
a
deposit
now
and
he
meets
you
at
nine
and
me
at
and
the
train
leaves
for
chicago
at
halfway
between
the
and
the
hotel
say
gubby
what
does
this
old
guy
look
like
gubb
albeit
with
a
tongue
unused
to
description
delineated
critz
as
best
he
could
and
as
he
proceeded
pete
became
interested
pinkish
and
bald
top
of
his
head
like
a
egg
he
got
a
scar
across
his
face
the
dickens
he
has
short
and
plump
and
a
old
nice
grandpa
blue
eyes
say
did
he
have
a
coughin
spell
and
choke
red
in
the
face
well

he
said
old
himself
that
right
and
caught
him
with
the
goods
say
listen
gubby
for
five
minutes
pete
talked
while
gubb
sat
with
his
mouth
wide
open

and
do
you

me

gubb
got
it
when
he
entered
his
bedroom
critz
was
waiting
for
him
it
was
slightly
after
eight
perhaps
critz
had
what
appeared
to
be
the
neatly
wrapped
in
newspaper
and
he
looked
up
with
his
kindly
blue
eyes
he
had
been
reading
the
complete
con
man
and
had
pushed
his
spectacles
up
on
his
forehead
as
gubb
entered
i
done
that
brick
up
for
you
he
said
indicating
it
with
his
hand
so
it
would
glitter
whilst
you
was
goin
through
the
street
if
word
got
passed
around
there
was
a
in
town
folks
might
sort
of
get

my
wife

chuckled

she

what

gubb

from
his
pocket

said
critz
mildly
but
i
it
just
as
well
thankee
mister
gubb
i
just
pile
into
my
coat
gubb
had
picked
up
the
and
now
he
let
it
fall
once
more
the
door
flew
open
but
this
time
it
opened
for
three
stalwart
policemen
whose
revolvers
pointed
unwaveringly
at
critz
the
plump
little
man
gave
one
glance
and
put
up
his
hands
all
right
boys
you
got
me
he
said
in
quite
another
voice
and
allowed
them
to
seize
his
arms
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
police
but
at
gubb
who
was
tearing
the
wrapper
from
what
proved
to
be
but
a
common
vitrified
he
looked
long
and
hard
say
said
critz
to
gubb
i
the
goat
you
stung
all
right
you
worked
me
to
a
finish
i
thought
i
knew
all
of
you
from
burns
down
but
you
a
new
one
to
me
who
are
you
anyway
gubb
looked
up
me
he
said
with
pride
why
why
i
gubb
the
foremost
deteckative
of
riverbank
iowa
the
pet
on
the
morning
following
his
capture
of
the
egg
the
riverbank
eagle
printed
two
full
columns
in
praise
of
detective
gubb
and
complimented
riverbank
on
having
a
superior
to
sherlock
holmes
in
its
midst
philo
gubb
said
the
eagle
has
thus
far
received
only
eleven
of
the
twelve
lessons
from
the
rising
sun
detective
correspondence
school
of
detecting
and
we
look
for
great
things
from
him
when
he
finally
receives
his
diploma
and
badge
he
informed
us
that
he
hopes
to
begin
work
on
the
dynamite
case
soon
with
the
money
he
will
receive
for
capturing
the
egg
gubb
intends
to
purchase
eighteen
complete
disguises
from
the
supply
department
of
the
rising
sun
detective
agency
slocum
ohio
gubb
wishes
us
to
announce
that
until
the
disguises
arrive
he
will
continue
to
do
decorating
and
interior
painting
at
reasonable
rates
unfortunately
there
were
no
calls
for
gubb
detective
services
for
some
time
after
he
received
his
disguises
and
diploma
but
while
waiting
he
devoted
his
spare
time
to
the
dynamite
mystery
a
remarkable
case
on
which
many
detectives
had
been
working
for
many
weeks
this
led
only
to
his
being
beaten
up
twice
by
joseph
henry
one
of
the
men
he
shadowed
the
arrival
in
riverbank
of
the
world
monster
combined
shows
the
day
after
gubb
received
his
diploma
seemed
to
offer
an
opportunity
for
his
detective
talents
as
a
circus
is
usually
accompanied
by
crooks
and
early
in
the
morning
gubb
donned
disguise
number
sixteen
which
was
catalogued
as
negro
complete
but
while
looking
for
crooks
while
watching
the
circus
unload
his
eyes
alighted
on
syrilla
known
as
half
a
ton
of
beauty
the
fat
lady
of
the
as
syrilla
descended
from
the
car
aided
by
the
living
skeleton
and
the
strong
man
the
fair
creature
wore
a
evening
gown
her
arms
and
shoulders
were
snowy
white
except
for
a
peculiar
mark
on
one
arm
not
only
had
gubb
never
seen
such
white
arms
and
shoulders
but
he
had
never
seen
so
much
arm
and
shoulder
on
one
woman
and
from
that
moment
he
was
deeply
and
hopelessly
in
love
like
one
hypnotized
he
followed
her
to
the
tent
paid
his
admission
and
stood
all
day
before
her
platform
he
was
still
there
when
the
tent
was
taken
down
that
night
gubb
was
not
the
only
man
in
riverbank
to
fall
in
love
with
syrilla
when
the
ladies
of
the
riverbank
social
service
league
heard
that
the
circus
was
coming
to
town
they
were
distressed
to
think
how
narrow
the
intellectual
life
of
the
freaks
must
be
and
they
instructed
their
field
secretary
horace
winterberry
to
go
to
the
and
organize
the
freaks
into
an
ibsen
literary
and
debating
society
this
winterberry
did
and
the
tasmanian
wild
man
was
made
president
but
so
deeply
did
winterberry
fall
in
love
with
syrilla
that
he
begged
dorgan
the
manager
of
the
to
let
him
join
the
and
this
dorgan
did
putting
him
in
a
cage
as
the
mexican
hairless
as
winterberry
was
exceedingly
bald
at
the
very
next
stop
made
by
the
circus
a
strong
woman
entered
the
and
dragged
winterberry
away
this
was
his
wife
of
this
the
ladies
of
the
riverbank
social
service
league
knew
nothing
however
they
believed
winterberry
had
been
stolen
by
the
circus
and
that
he
was
doubtless
being
forced
to
learn
to
swing
on
a
trapeze
or
ride
a
bareback
horse
and
they
decided
to
hire
detective
gubb
to
find
and
return
him
at
the
very
moment
when
the
ladies
were
deciding
to
retain
services
the
detective
was
on
his
way
to
do
a
job
of
thinking
of
the
fair
syrilla
he
might
never
see
again
when
suddenly
he
put
down
the
pail
of
paste
he
was
carrying
and
grasped
the
handle
of
his
more
firmly
he
stared
with
amazement
and
fright
at
a
remarkable
creature
that
came
toward
him
from
a
small
thicket
near
the
railway
tracks
gubb
first
and
correct
impression
was
that
this
was
some
remarkable
creature
escaped
from
the
circus
the
horrid
thing
loping
toward
him
was
indeed
the
tasmanian
wild
man
as
the
wild
man
approached
philo
gubb
prepared
to
defend
himself
he
was
prepared
to
defend
himself
to
his
last
drop
of
blood
when
halfway
across
the
field
the
tasmanian
wild
man
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
and
as
if
fearing
pursuit
increased
his
speed
and
came
toward
philo
gubb
in
great
leaps
and
bounds
the
correspondence
school
detective
waved
his
more
frantically
than
ever
the
tasmanian
wild
man
stopped
short
within
six
feet
of
him
viewed
thus
closely
the
wild
man
was
a
sight
to
curdle
the
blood
remnants
of
chains
hung
from
his
wrists
and
ankles
his
long
hair
was
matted
about
his
face
and
his
finger
nails
were
long
and
his
face
was
daubed
with
ochre
and
red
with
black
rings
around
the
eyes
and
the
circles
within
the
rings
were
painted
white
giving
him
an
air
of
wildness
possessed
by
but
few
wild
men
his
only
garments
were
a
pair
of
very
short
trunks
and
the
skin
of
some
wild
animal
bound
about
his
body
with
ropes
of
philo
gubb
bent
to
receive
the
leap
he
felt
the
tasmanian
wild
man
was
about
to
make
but
to
his
surprise
the
wild
man
held
up
one
hand
in
token
of
amity
and
with
the
other
removed
the
matted
hair
from
his
head
revealing
an
of
taffy
yellow
neatly
parted
in
the
middle
and
smoothed
back
carefully
i
say
old
chap
he
said
in
a
pleasant
and
tone
stop
waving
that
weapon
at
me
will
you
my
intentions
are
most
kindly
i
assure
you
can
you
inform
me
where
a
chap
can
get
a
pair
of
trousers
hereabout
philo
gubb
experienced
eye
saw
at
once
that
this
creature
was
less
wild
than
he
was
painted
he
lowered
the
come
into
this
house
said
philo
gubb
inside
the
house
we
can
discuss
pants
in
calmness
the
tasmanian
wild
man
accepted
now
then
said
philo
gubb
when
they
were
safe
in
the
kitchen
he
seated
himself
on
a
roll
of
and
the
tasmanian
wild
man
whose
real
name
was
waldo
emerson
snooks
told
his
brief
story
upon
graduating
from
harvard
he
had
sought
employment
offering
to
furnish
entertainment
by
the
evening
reading
an
essay
entitled
the
comparative
mentality
of
ibsen
and
emerson
with
sidelights
on
the
effect
of
turnip
diet
at
brook
farm
but
the
agency
was
unable
to
get
him
any
engagements
they
happened
however
to
receive
a
request
from
dorgan
manager
of
the
asking
for
a
tasmanian
wild
man
and
snooks
had
taken
that
job
to
his
own
surprise
he
made
an
excellent
wild
man
he
was
able
to
rattle
his
chains
dash
up
and
down
the
cage
gnaw
the
iron
bars
of
the
cage
eat
raw
meat
and
howl
as
no
other
tasmanian
wild
man
had
ever
done
those
things
and
all
would
have
been
well
if
an
interloper
had
not
entered
the
the
interloper
was
winterberry
who
had
introduced
the
subject
of
ibsen
plays
and
in
a
discussion
of
them
the
tasmanian
wild
man
and
hoxie
the
strong
man
had
quarreled
and
hoxie
had
threatened
to
tear
snooks
limb
from
limb
and
he
would
have
done
so
said
the
tasmanian
wild
man
with
emotion
if
i
had
not
fled
i
dare
not
return
i
mean
to
work
my
way
back
to
boston
and
give
up
tasmanian
wild
as
a
profession
but
i
can
not
without
pants
i
guess
you
ca
said
philo
gubb
in
any
station
of
boston
life
pants
is
expected
to
be
worn
so
the
question
is
old
chap
where
am
i
to
be
panted
said
waldo
emerson
snooks
i
ca
pant
you
said
philo
gubb
but
i
can
overall
you
the
late
tasmanian
wild
man
was
most
grateful
when
he
was
dressed
in
the
overalls
and
had
wiped
the
from
his
face
on
an
old
rag
no
one
would
have
recognized
him
and
as
for
thanks
said
philo
gubb
do
mention
it
a
deteckative
gent
is
obliged
to
keep
up
a
set
of
disguises
hitherto
unsuspected
by
the
mortal
world
this
tasmanian
wild
man
outfit
will
do
for
a
hermit
disguise
so
you
do
owe
me
no
thanks
as
philo
gubb
watched
waldo
emerson
snooks
start
in
the
direction
of
boston
only
some
thirteen
hundred
miles
away
he
had
no
idea
how
soon
he
would
have
occasion
to
use
the
tasmanian
wild
man
disguise
but
hardly
had
the
wild
man
departed
than
a
small
boy
came
to
summon
gubb
and
it
was
with
a
sense
of
elation
and
importance
that
he
appeared
before
the
meeting
of
the
riverbank
ladies
social
service
league
and
so
said
garthwaite
at
the
close
of
the
interview
you
understand
us
mr
gubb
yes
said
philo
gubb
what
you
want
me
to
do
is
to
find
winterberry
ai
it
exactly
agreed
garthwaite
and
when
found
said
gubb
the
said
stolen
goods
is
to
be
returned
to
you
just
so
and
the
fiends
in
human
form
that
stole
him
are
to
be
given
the
full
limit
of
the
law
they
certainly
deserve
it
abducting
a
nice
little
gentleman
like
winterberry
said
garthwaite
they
do
indeed
said
philo
gubb
and
they
shall
be
i
would
only
ask
how
far
you
want
me
to
arrest
if
the
manager
of
the
stole
him
my
natural
and
professional
deteckative
instincts
would
tell
me
to
arrest
the
manager
and
if
the
whole
stole
him
i
would
make
bold
to
arrest
the
whole
but
if
the
whole
circus
stole
him
am
i
to
arrest
the
whole
circus
and
if
so
ought
i
to
include
the
menagerie
ought
i
to
arrest
the
elephants
and
the
camels
arrest
only
those
in
human
form
said
garthwaite
philo
gubb
sat
straight
and
put
his
hands
on
his
knees
in
referring
to
human
form
he
asked
do
you
include
them
oorangootangs
and
apes
i
do
said
garthwaite
association
with
criminals
has
probably
inclined
their
poor
minds
to
criminality
yes
said
philo
gubb
rising
i
leave
on
this
case
by
the
first
train
gubb
hastily
packed
the
tasmanian
garment
and
six
other
disguises
in
a
suitcase
put
the
fourteen
dollars
given
him
by
garthwaite
in
his
pocket
and
hurried
to
catch
the
train
for
bardville
where
the
world
monster
combined
shows
were
to
show
the
next
day
with
true
detective
caution
philo
gubb
disguised
even
this
simple
act
having
packed
his
suitcase
gubb
wrapped
it
carefully
in
manila
paper
and
inserted
a
laundry
ticket
under
the
twine
thus
any
one
seeing
him
might
well
suppose
he
was
returning
from
the
laundry
and
not
going
to
bardville
to
make
this
seem
the
more
likely
he
donned
his
chinese
disguise
number
seventeen
consisting
of
a
pink
wig
with
a
long
pigtail
a
blue
jumper
and
a
yellow
complexion
gubb
rubbed
his
face
with
crude
ochre
powder
and
his
complexion
was
a
little
high
being
more
the
hue
of
a
pumpkin
than
the
true
oriental
skin
tint
those
he
met
on
his
way
to
the
station
imagined
he
was
in
the
last
stages
of
yellow
fever
and
fled
from
him
hastily
he
reached
the
station
just
as
the
train
wheels
began
to
move
and
he
was
springing
up
the
steps
onto
the
platform
of
the
last
car
when
a
hand
grasped
his
arm
he
turned
his
head
and
saw
that
the
man
grasping
him
was
jonas
medderbrook
one
of
riverbank
wealthiest
men
gubb
i
want
you
shouted
medderbrook
energetically
but
philo
gubb
shook
off
the
detaining
arm
me
no
savvy
melican
talkee
he
jabbered
bunting
medderbrook
off
the
car
step
bright
and
early
next
morning
philo
gubb
gave
himself
a
healthy
coat
of
tan
with
rather
high
color
on
his
from
his
collection
of
beards
and
mustaches
carefully
tagged
from
number
one
to
number
eighteen
in
harmony
with
the
types
of
disguise
mentioned
in
the
twelve
lessons
of
the
rising
sun
detective
agency
correspondence
school
of
detecting
he
selected
mustache
number
eight
and
inserted
the
spring
wires
in
his
nostrils
mustache
number
eight
was
a
long
deadly
black
mustache
with
ends
and
when
philo
gubb
had
donned
it
he
had
a
most
sinister
appearance
particularly
as
he
failed
to
remove
the
string
tag
which
bore
the
legend
number
eight
gambler
or
card
sharp
manufactured
and
sold
by
the
rising
sun
detective
agency
correspondence
school
of
detecting
supply
bureau
having
put
on
this
mustache
gubb
took
a
common
splint
from
under
the
bed
and
placed
in
it
the
matted
hair
of
the
tasmanian
wild
man
his
materials
a
small
mirror
two
towels
a
cake
of
soap
the
tasmanian
wild
man
animal
skin
robe
the
hair
rope
and
the
abbreviated
trunks
he
covered
these
with
a
newspaper
the
sun
was
just
rising
when
he
reached
the
railway
siding
and
hardly
had
gubb
arrived
when
the
work
of
unloading
the
circus
began
illustration
winterberry
did
not
seem
to
be
concealed
among
them
gubb
searching
for
the
abducted
winterberry
sped
rapidly
from
place
to
place
the
string
tag
on
his
mustache
napping
over
his
shoulder
but
he
saw
no
one
answering
garthwaite
description
of
winterberry
when
the
tent
wagons
had
departed
the
elephants
and
camels
were
unloaded
but
winterberry
did
not
seem
to
be
concealed
among
them
and
the
animal
cages
which
came
next
were
all
tightly
closed
there
were
four
or
five
cars
however
that
attracted
philo
gubb
attention
and
one
in
particular
made
his
heart
beat
rapidly
this
car
bore
the
words
world
monster
combined
shows
freak
car
and
as
winterberry
had
gone
as
a
social
reform
agent
to
the
gubb
rightly
felt
that
here
if
anywhere
he
would
find
a
clue
and
he
was
doubly
agitated
since
he
knew
the
beautiful
syrilla
was
doubtless
in
that
car
walking
around
the
car
he
heard
the
door
at
one
end
open
he
crouched
under
the
platform
his
ears
and
eyes
on
edge
hardly
was
he
concealed
before
the
head
ruffian
of
the
unloading
gang
approached
mister
dorgan
he
said
in
quite
another
tone
than
he
had
used
to
his
laborers

wild
man

grounds

a
voice
and
dorgan
looked
around
to
see
syrilla
the
fat
lady
standing
in
the
car
door
oh

said
dorgan
laughing

the
fat

reproachfully
and
i
do

is
nice

and
a

and

wo

said
dorgan
firmly
a
corpse
may
be
a
corpse
syrilla
any
place
but
in
a
circus
but
in
a
circus
it
is
a
feature
he
goin
to
be
one
of
the
seven
sleepers
one
of
what
asked
syrilla
one
of
the
seven
sleepers
said
dorgan
i
goin
to
put
him
in
the
cage
the
wild
man
was
in
and
i
goin
to
tell
the
audiences
asleep

dead
i
say
i
give
my
word
he
only
asleep
we
offer
five
thousand
dollars
i
say
any
man
woman
or
child
that
proves
contrary
than
that
we
have
documents
provin
that
this
human
bein
in
this
cage
fell
asleep
in
the
year
and
has
been
sleepin
ever
since
the
longest
nap
on
record
i
say
that
fetch
a
laugh
and
you
do
care
dearie
that
i
be
creepy
all
through
the
show
do
you
said
syrilla
i
wo
care
a
hang
said
dorgan
gubb
glided
noiselessly
from
under
the
car
and
sped
away
he
had
heard
enough
to
know
that
deviltry
was
afoot
there
was
no
doubt
in
his
mind
that
the
pet
was
the
late
winterberry
for
if
ever
a
man
deserved
to
be
called
pet
winterberry
according
to
garthwaite
description
was
that
man
there
was
no
doubt
that
winterberry
had
been
murdered
and
that
these
heartless
wretches
meant
to
make
capital
of
his
body
the
inference
was
logical
it
was
a
strong
clue
and
gubb
hurried
to
the
circus
grounds
to
study
the
situation
no
said
syrilla
tearfully
you
care
a
hang
for
the
nerves
of
the
lady
and
gent
freaks
under
your
care
dorgan
it
to
you
if
repulsion
from
that
pet
drags
seventy
or
eighty
pounds
of
fat
off
of
me
for
you
well
know
what
my
contract
is
so
much
a
week
and
so
much
for
each
additional
pound
of
fat
and
the
less
fat
i
am
the
less
you
have
to
add
onto
your
the
day
the
pet
come
to
the
show
first
i
fainted
outright
and
busted
down
the
platform
but
little
do
you
care
mr
dorgan
do
you
worry
you
did
murder
him
said
dorgan
he
looks
so
lifelike
sobbed
syrilla
oh
hoxie
shouted
dorgan
yes
sir
said
the
strong
man
coming
to
the
car
door
take
syrilla
in
and
tell
the
girls
to
put
ice
on
her
head
gettin
hysterics
again
and
when
you
told
you
go
up
to
the
grounds
and
tell
blake
and
skinny
to
unpack
the
petrified
man
tell
i
goin
to
use
him
again
and
if
he
lookin
have
one
of
the
men
go
over
his
complexion
and
make
him
look
nice
and
lifelike
dorgan
swung
off
from
the
car
step
and
walked
away
the
petrified
man
had
been
one
of
his
mistakes
in
days
past
petrified
men
had
been
important
features
and
dorgan
had
supposed
the
time
had
come
to
them
and
he
had
had
an
excellent
petrified
man
made
of
concrete
with
steel
reinforcements
in
the
legs
and
arms
and
a
body
of
hollow
tile
so
that
it
could
stand
rough
travel
unfortunately
the
features
of
the
petrified
man
had
been
entrusted
to
an
artist
devoted
to
the
making
of
clothing
dummies
instead
of
an
aztec
or
cave
dweller
cast
of
countenance
he
had
given
the
petrified
man
the
simpering
features
of
the
wax
figures
seen
in
cheap
clothing
stores
the
result
was
that
instead
of
gazing
at
the
petrified
man
with
awe
as
a
wonder
of
nature
the
audiences
laughed
at
him
and
the
living
freaks
dubbed
him
the
pet
or
still
more
rudely
the
corpse
and
when
the
glass
case
broke
at
the
end
of
the
week
dorgan
ordered
the
pet
packed
in
a
box
just
now
however
the
flight
of
the
tasmanian
wild
man
and
the
involuntary
departure
of
winterberry
at
the
command
of
his
wife
after
his
short
appearance
as
the
mexican
hairless
suggested
the
new
use
for
the
petrified
man
when
detective
gubb
reached
the
circus
grounds
the
glaring
banners
had
not
yet
been
erected
before
the
tent
but
all
the
tents
except
the
big
top
were
up
and
all
hands
were
at
work
on
that
one
or
supposed
to
be
two
were
not
two
of
the
roustabouts
after
glancing
here
and
there
glided
into
the
property
tent
and
concealed
themselves
behind
a
pile
of
blue
cases
hampers
and
canvas
bags
one
of
them
immediately
drew
from
under
his
coat
a
small
but
heavy
parcel
wrapped
in
an
old
rag
say
cul
he
said
in
a
coarse
voice
you
sure
have
got
a
head
on
you
this
here
stuff
will
be
just
as
safe
in
there
as
in
a
bank
see
gim
me
the
to
be
opened
until
chicago
said
the
other
gleefully
pointing
to
the
words
daubed
on
one
of
the
blue
cases
but
i
guess
it
will
be
hey
old
pal
i
guess
so
together
they
removed
the
lid
of
the
box
and
detective
gubb
seeking
the
crawled
under
the
wall
of
the
property
tent
just
in
time
to
see
the
two
ruffians
hurriedly
jam
their
parcel
into
the
case
and
screw
the
lid
in
place
again
gubb
mustache
was
now
in
a
diagonal
position
but
little
he
cared
for
that
his
eyes
were
fastened
on
the
countenances
of
the
two
roustabouts
the
men
were
easy
to
remember
one
was
and
pockmarked
and
the
other
was
dark
and
the
lobes
of
his
ears
were
slit
as
if
some
one
had
at
some
time
forcibly
removed
a
pair
of
rings
from
them
very
quietly
philo
gubb
wiggled
backward
out
of
the
tent
but
as
he
did
so
his
eyes
caught
a
word
painted
on
the
side
of
the
blue
case
it
was
gubb
proceeded
to
the
next
tent
stooping
he
peered
inside
and
what
he
saw
satisfied
him
that
he
had
found
the
around
the
inside
of
the
tent
men
were
erecting
a
blue
platform
and
on
the
far
side
four
men
were
wheeling
a
tongueless
cage
into
place
a
door
at
the
back
of
the
cage
swung
open
and
shut
as
the
men
moved
the
cage
but
another
in
front
was
securely
bolted
and
barred
gubb
lowered
the
tent
wall
and
backed
away
it
was
into
this
cage
that
the
body
of
winterberry
was
to
be
put
to
make
a
public
holiday
for
yokels
and
the
murderer
was
still
at
large
murderer
murderers
for
who
were
the
two
rough
characters
he
had
seen
tampering
with
the
case
containing
the
remains
of
the
pet
what
had
they
been
putting
in
the
case
if
not
the
murderers
they
were
surely
accomplices
walking
like
a
wary
flamingo
gubb
circled
the
tent
he
saw
dorgan
and
syrilla
enter
it
himself
hidden
in
a
clump
of
bushes
he
saw
lonergan
the
living
skeleton
hoxie
the
strong
man
major
ching
the
chinese
giant
general
thumb
the
dwarf
princess
zozo
the
serpent
charmer
maggie
the
circassian
girl
and
the
rest
of
the
employees
enter
the
tent
then
he
removed
his
number
eight
mustache
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
balanced
his
mirror
against
a
twig
gubb
was
changing
his
disguise
for
a
while
the
lady
and
gentleman
freaks
stood
talking
casting
reproachful
glances
at
dorgan
syrilla
with
traces
of
tears
on
her
face
was
complaining
of
the
cruel
man
who
insisted
that
the
pet
become
part
of
the
show
once
more
and
dorgan
was
resisting
their
reproaches
i
the
boss
of
the
show
he
said
firmly
i
goin
to
use
that
cage
and
i
goin
to
use
the
pet
could
you
put
orlando
in
it
and
get
up
a
spiel
about
him
asked
princess
zozo
whose
largest
serpent
was
called
orlando
if
you
got
him
a
bottle
of
cold
cream
from
the
tent
he
lie
for
hours
with
his
dear
little
nose
sniffin
it
he
pashnutly
fond
of
cold
cream
well
the
public
ai
pashnutly
fond
of
seein
a

it
said
dorgan
the
pet

goin
into
that
cage
see
could
you
borry
an
ape
from
the
menagerie
asked
lonergan
the
living
skeleton
who
was
as
passionately
fond
of
syrilla
as
orlando
was
of
cold
cream
and
have
him
be
the
first
to
speak
the
human
language
only
he
got
a
cold

and
got
roasted
by
the
whole
crowd
no
sir
lonergan
i
ca
and
i
wo
bring
that
case
right
over
here
he
added
turning
to
the
four
roustabouts
who
were
carrying
the
blue
case
into
the
tent
got
it
open
good
now
he
looked
toward
the
cage
and
stopped
short
his
mouth
open
and
his
eyes
staring
sitting
on
his
haunches
his
fore
paws
or
hands
hanging
down
like
those
of
a
begging
dog
a
tasmanian
wild
man
stared
from
between
the
bars
of
the
cage
the
matted
hair
the
bare
legs
the
animal
skin
blanket
the
streaks
of
ochre
and
red
on
the
face
the
black
circles
around
the
eyes
with
the
white
inside
the
circles
were
those
of
a
real
tasmanian
wild
man
but
this
tasmanian
wild
man
was
tall
and
thin
almost
rivaling
lonergan
in
that
respect
the
thin
roman
nose
and
the
blinky
eyes
together
with
the
manner
of
holding
the
head
on
one
side
suggested
a
bird
a
large
and
dissipated
flamingo
for
instance
dorgan
stared
with
his
mouth
open
he
stared
so
steadily
that
he
even
took
a
telegram
from
the
messenger
boy
who
entered
the
tent
and
signed
for
it
without
looking
at
the
address
the
messenger
boy
too
stopped
to
stare
at
the
tasmanian
flamingo
the
men
who
had
brought
the
blue
case
set
it
down
and
stared
the
freaks
gathered
in
front
of
the
cage
and
stared
what
is
it
asked
syrilla
in
a
voice
trembling
with
emotion
say
where
in
the
did
come
from
asked
dorgan
suddenly
what
in
the
dickens
are
you
anyway
i
a
tasmanian
wild
man
said
gubb
mildly
you
a
tasmanian
wild
man
said
dorgan
you
do
think
you
look
like
a
tasmanian
wild
man
do
you
why
you
look
like
you
look
like
you
look
he
looks
like
an
intoxicated
pterodactyl
said
lonergan
who
had
some
knowledge
of
prehistoric
animals
only
hairier
he
looks
like
a
human
turkey
with
a
piebald
face
suggested
general
thumb
he
do
look
like
nothin
said
dorgan
at
last
that
what
he
looks
like
you
get
out
of
that
cage
he
added
sternly
to
gubb
i
do
want
nothin
that
looks
like

nowhere
near
this
show
but
dorgan
dearie
think
how
he
draw
crowds
said
syrilla
crowds
of
course

draw
crowds
said
dorgan
but
what
would
i
say
when
i
lectured
about
him
what
would
i
call
him
no
he
got
to
go
boys
he
said
to
the
four
roustabouts
two
of
whom
were
those
gubb
had
seen
in
the
property
tent
throw
this
feller
out
of
the
tent
stop
said
gubb
raising
one
hand
i
will
admit
i
have
tried
to
deceive
you
i
am
not
a
tasmanian
wild
man
i
am
a
deteckative
detective
said
dorgan
in
disguise
said
gubb
modestly
in
the
deteckative
profession
the
assuming
of
disguises
is
often
necessary
to
the
completion
of
the
clarification
of
a
mystery
plot
he
pointed
down
at
the
pet
whose
newly
rouged
and
powdered
face
rested
smirkingly
in
the
box
below
the
cage
i
arrest
you
all
he
said
but
before
he
could
complete
the
sentence
the
man
and
the
man
turned
and
bolted
from
the
tent
gubb
beat
and
jerked
at
the
bars
of
his
cage
as
frantically
as
waldo
emerson
snooks
had
ever
beaten
and
jerked
but
he
could
not
rend
them
apart
get
those
two
fellers
gubb
shouted
to
hoxie
and
the
strong
man
ran
from
the
tent
what
this
about
arrest
asked
dorgan
i
arrest
this
whole
said
gubb
pressing
his
face
between
the
bars
of
the
cage
for
the
murder
of
that
poor
gentle
harmless
man
now
a
dead
corpse
into
that
blue
box
there
winterberry
by
name
but
called
by
you
by
the
alias
of
the
winterberry
exclaimed
dorgan
that
winterberry
that
winterberry
that
a
stone
man
a
concrete
man
with
hollow
tile
stomach
and
reinforced
concrete
arms
and
legs
i
had
him
made
to
order
the
criminal
mind
is
well
equipped
with
explanations
for

of
stress
said
gubb
lesson
six
of
the
correspondence
school
of

warns
the
deteckative
against
explanations
of
murderers
when
confronted
by
the
victim
i
demand
an
autopsy
onto
mr
winterberry
autopsy
exclaimed
dorgan
i
autopsy
him
for
you
he
grasped
one
of
the
pet
hands
and
wrenched
off
one
concrete
arm
he
struck
the
head
with
a
tent
stake
and
shattered
it
into
crumbling
concrete
he
jerked
the
roman
tunic
from
the
body
and
disclosed
the
hollow
tile
stomach
hello
he
said
lifting
a
parcel
from
the
interior
of
the
pet
what
this
when
unwrapped
it
proved
to
be
two
dozen
silver
forks
and
spoons
and
a

dorgan

how

jonas

dorgan
and

said
dorgan
and

jonas

you
did
actually
come
here
to
find
winterberry
did
you
asked
syrilla
gubb
folded
the
telegram
raised
his
matted
hair
and
tucked
the
telegram
between
it
and
his
own
hair
for
when
a
deteckative
starts
out
to
detect
he
said
calmly
sometimes
he
detects
one
thing
and
sometimes
he
detects
another
that
cup
is
one
of
the
things
i
deteckated
and
now
if
all
are
willing
step
outside
and
get
my
pants
on
i
feel
better
and
you
look
better
said
dorgan
you
could
look
worse
in
the
course
of
the
deteckative
career
said
gubb
a
gent
has
to
look
a
lot
of
different
ways
and
i
thank
you
for
the
compliment
the
art
of
disguising
the
human
physiology
is
difficult
this
disguise
is
but
one
of
many
i
am
frequently
called
upon
to
assume
well
if
any
more
are
like
this
one
said
dorgan
with
sincerity
i
glad
i
not
a
detective
syrilla
however
heaved
her
several
hundred
pounds
of
bosom
and
cast
her
eyes
toward
gubb
i
think
detectives
are
lovely
in
any
disguise
she
said
and
gubb
heart
beat
wildly
the
eagle
claws
as
philo
gubb
boarded
the
train
for
riverbank
after
recovering
the
silver
from
the
interior
of
the
petrified
man
he
cast
a
regretful
glance
backward
it
was
for
syrilla
there
was
half
a
ton
of
her
beauty
and
her
placid
expression
touched
an
echoing
chord
in
philo
gubb
heart
philo
felt
however
that
his
admiration
must
be
hopeless
for
syrilla
must
earn
a
salary
in
keeping
with
her
size
and
his
income
was
too
irregular
and
small
to
keep
even
a
thin
wife
five
hundred
dollars
was
a
large
reward
for
a
that
cost
not
over
thirty
dollars
it
is
true
but
jonas
medderbrook
could
afford
to
pay
what
he
chose
and
as
he
was
passionately
fond
of
golf
and
passionately
poor
at
the
game
and
as
this
was
probably
the
only
golf
prize
he
would
ever
win
he
was
justified
in
paying
liberally
especially
as
this
cup
was
not
merely
a
tankard
but
almost
large
enough
to
be
called
a
tank
detective
gubb
hastened
to
the
home
of
medderbrook
but
when
the
door
of
that
palatial
house
opened
the
colored
butler
told
gubb
that
medderbrook
was
at
the
golf
club
attending
the
annual
banquet
of
the
fifty
worst
duffers
gubb
started
for
the
golf
club
as
he
walked
he
thought
of
syrilla
and
he
was
at
the
gate
of
the
golf
club
before
he
knew
it
he
walked
up
the
path
toward
the
but
when
halfway
he
stopped
short
all
his
detective
instincts
aroused
the
windows
of
the
glowed
with
light
and
sounds
of
merriment
issued
from
them
but
the
cause
of
philo
gubb
sudden
pause
was
a
head
silhouetted
against
one
of
the
glowing
windows
as
gubb
watched
he
saw
the
head
disappear
in
the
gloom
below
the
window
only
to
reappear
at
another
window
gubb
following
the
directions
as
laid
down
in
lesson
four
of
the
correspondence
lessons
dropped
to
his
hands
and
knees
and
crept
silently
toward
the
paul
pry
when
within
a
few
feet
of
him
gubb
seated
himself
on
the
grass
as
philo
sat
on
the
damp
grass
the
man
at
the
window
turned
his
head
and
gubb
noted
with
surprise
that
the
stranger
had
none
of
the
marks
of
a
sodden
criminal
the
face
was
that
of
a
respectably
benevolent
old
gentleman
kindliness
and
beamed
from
its
lines
but
at
the
moment
the
plump
little
man
seemed
in
trouble
said
gubb
i
presume
you
are
taking
an
observation
of
the
within
the
inside
of
the
club
the
old
gentleman
turned
sharply
illustration
a
head
silhouetted
against
one
of
the
glowing
windows
shess
he
said
i
look
at
der
peoples
eading

to
see

und
sooch
goot
eaders

mit

vos
a
schplendid
eader
gubb
raised
himself
to
his
knees
and
looked
into
the
that
he
said
is
the
honorable
jonas
medderbrook
the
wealthiest
rich
man
in
riverbank
metterbrook
mettercrook
said
the
old
not
chones
eh
not
jones
to
my
present
personal
knowledge
at
this
time
said
philo
gubb
not
chones
repeated
the
plumply
dot
vos
stranche
you
vos
sure
he
vos
not
chones
i
quite
almost
positive
upon
that
point
of
knowledge
said
philo
gubb
for
i
have
under
my
arm
a
golf
cup
i
am
returning
back
to
medderbrook
to
receive
five
hundred
dollars
reward
from
him
for
so
queried
the
stranger
fife
hunderdt
dollars
und
it
is
his
cup
it
is
said
philo
gubb
he
raised
the
cup
in
his
hand
that
the
stranger
might
read
the
inscription
stating
that
the
cup
was
jonas
medderbrook
the
light
of
the
window
made
the
engraving
easy
to
read
but
the
old
first
drew
from
his
pocket
a
pair
of
spectacles
and
adjusted
them
carefully
on
his
nose
he
then
took
the
cup
and
moved
closer
to
the
window
and
read
the
inscription
shess
shess
he
agreed
nodding
his
head
several
times
and
then
he
smiled
at
gubb
a
broadly
benevolent
smile
oxcoose
me
he
added
and
with
gentle
deliberation
he
removed
gubb
hat
shoost
a
minute
please
he
continued
and
with
his
free
hand
he
felt
gently
of
the
top
of
gubb
head
he
turned
gubb
head
gently
to
the
right
so
he
exclaimed
dot
vos
goot
he
raised
the
cup
above
his
head
and
brought
it
down
on
top
of
gubb
head
in
the
exact
spot
he
had
selected
for
two
moments
gubb
made
motions
with
his
hands
resembling
those
of
a
swimmer
and
then
he
collapsed
in
a
heap
the
kindly
looking
old
gentleman
seeing
he
was
quite
unconscious
tucked
the
golf
cup
under
his
own
arm
and
waddled
slowly
down
the
path
to
the
club
gates
ten
minutes
later
a
small
automobile
drove
up
and
young
anson
briggs
hopped
out
gubb
was
just
getting
to
his
feet
feeling
the
top
of
his
head
with
his
hand
as
he
did
so
here
said
briggs
you
must
not
do
that
why
ca
i
do
it
gubb
asked
crossly
it
is
my
own
personal
head
and
if
i
wish
to
desire
to
rub
it
you
are
not
concerned
in
the
occasion
whatever
oh
rub
your
head
if
you
want
to
exclaimed
the
doctor
i
say
you
must
not
stand
up
a
man
that
has
just
had
a
fit
must
not
stand
up
who
had
a
fit
asked
philo
gubb
you
did
said
briggs
i
am
told
you
had
a
very
bad
fit
and
fell
and
knocked
your
head
against
the
building
you
dazed
lie
down
i
prefer
to
wish
to
stand
erect
on
my
feet
said
gubb
firmly
where
my
cup
what
cup
who
told
you
i
was
suffering
from
the
symptom
of
a
fit
demanded
philo
gubb
why
a
short
plump
little
german
did
said
the
doctor
he
sent
me
here
and
he
gave
me
this
to
give
to
you
the
doctor
held
an
envelope
toward
gubb
and
the
detective
took
it
and
tore
it
open
by
the
light
of
the
window
he
read
rec
of
jones
golluf
cup
worth
schreckenheim
philo
gubb
turned
to
briggs
i
am
much
obliged
for
the
hastiness
with
which
you
came
to
relieve
one
you
considered
to
think
in
trouble
doctor
he
said
but
fits
are
not
in
my
line
of
sickness
which
mainly
is
dyspeptic
to
date
now
what
is
all
this
asked
the
doctor
suspiciously
what
is
that
letter
anyway
it
is
a
clue
said
philo
gubb
which
connected
with
the
bump
on
the
top
of
the
cranium
of
my
skull
will
no
doubt
land
somebody
into
jail
so
doctor
he
picked
his
hat
from
the
lawn
and
in
his
most
stately
manner
walked
around
the
and
in
at
the
door
inside
the
gubb
asked
one
of
the
waiters
to
call
medderbrook
and
medderbrook
immediately
appeared
as
he
came
from
the
rapidly
the
napkin
he
had
had
tucked
in
his
neck
fell
over
his
shoulder
behind
him
and
medderbrook
instead
of
turning
around
bent
backward
until
he
could
pick
up
the
napkin
with
his
teeth
after
which
he
resumed
his
normal
upright
position
excuse
me
gubb
he
said
i
did
think
what
i
was
doing
where
is
the
cup
the
detective
explained
he
handed
medderbrook
the
receipt
that
had
been
sent
by
schreckenheim
and
the
moment
eyes
fell
upon
it
he
turned
red
that
infernal
dutchman
he
cried
although
schreckenheim
was
not
a
dutchman
at
all
but
a
i
jail
him
for
this
he
stopped
short
gubb
he
said
did
that
fellow
tell
you
what
his
business
was
he
did
not
said
philo
gubb
he
failed
to
express
any
mention
of
it
that
man
said
medderbrook
bitterly
is
schreckenheim
the
greatest
tattoo
artist
in
the
world
he
is
the
king
of
them
all
a
connoisseur
in
tattooish
art
can
tell
a
schreckenheim
as
easily
as
a
can
tell
a
corot
but
no
matter
gubb
you
are
a
detective
and
i
believe
what
is
told
detectives
is
held
inviolable
yes
you
and
all
riverbank
see
in
me
an
ordinary
citizen
wealthy
perhaps
but
ordinary
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
once
he
looked
cautiously
around
i
was
once
a
contortionist
i
was
once
contortionist
and
now
i
am
a
wealthy
man
my
wife
left
me
because
she
said
i
was
stingy
and
she
took
my
child
my
only
daughter
i
have
never
seen
either
of
them
since
i
have
searched
high
and
low
but
i
can
not
find
them
gubb
i
would
give
the
man
that
finds
my
daughter
if
she
is
alive
a
thousand
dollars
you
do
object
to
my
attempting
to
try
said
philo
gubb
no
said
jonas
medderbrook
but
that
is
not
what
i
wish
to
explain
in
my
contortion
act
gubb
i
was
obliged
to
wear
the
most
expensive
silk
tights
wiggling
on
the
floor
destroys
them
rapidly
i
had
a
happy
thought
i
was
known
as
the
could
i
not
save
all
expense
of
tights
by
having
myself
tattooed
so
that
my
skin
would
represent
scales
look
medderbrook
pulled
up
his
cuff
and
showed
gubb
his
arm
it
was
beautifully
tattooed
in
red
and
blue
like
the
scales
of
a
cobra
the
cost
continued
medderbrook
was
great
herr
schreckenheim
worked
continuously
on
me
and
when
he
reached
my
manly
chest
i
had
a
brilliant
thought
i
would
have
tattooed
upon
it
an
american
eagle
imagine
the
enthusiasm
of
an
audience
when
i
stood
straight
spread
my
arms
and
showed
that
noble
emblem
of
our
nation
strength
and
freedom
i
told
herr
schreckenheim
and
he
set
to
work
when
and
the
contract
price
by
the
way
for
doing
that
eagle
was
five
hundred
dollars
when
the
eagle
was
about
completed
i
said
to
herr
schreckenheim
course
you
will
do
no
more
eagles
eagles
he
said
questioningly
other
men
i
said
want
to
be
the
only
man
with
an
eagle
on
my
chest
am
doing
an
eagle
on
another
man
now
he
said
i
was
angry
at
once
i
jumped
from
the
table
and
threw
on
my
clothes
i
cried
another
spot
or
dot
shall
you
make
on
me
go
i
will
never
pay
you
a
cent
he
was
very
angry
is
a
contract
he
cried
hundred
dollars
you
owe
me
owe
it
to
you
when
the
job
is
complete
i
declared
was
the
contract
is
this
job
complete
where
are
the
eagle
claws
never
pay
you
a
cent
we
had
a
lot
of
angry
words
he
demanded
that
i
give
him
a
chance
to
put
the
claws
on
the
eagle
i
refused
i
said
i
would
never
pay
he
said
he
would
follow
me
to
the
end
of
the
world
and
collect
he
said
he
would
do
those
eagle
claws
if
he
had
to
do
them
on
my
infant
daughter
i
dared
him
to
touch
the
child
and
now
said
medderbrook
he
has
taken
the
golf
cup
i
value
at
five
hundred
dollars
he
has
won
at
the
mention
of
the
threat
regarding
the
child
philo
gubb
eyes
opened
wide
but
he
kept
silence
gubb
said
medderbrook
suddenly
i
give
you
a
thousand
dollars
if
you
can
recover
my
poor
child
the
deteckative
profession
is
full
of
complicity
of
detail
said
gubb
and
the
impossible
is
quite
possible
when
put
in
the
right
hands
the
cup
bother
the
cup
said
medderbrook
carelessly
i
want
my
child
i
give
thousand
dollars
for
my
child
gubb
with
difficulty
could
philo
gubb
restrain
his
eagerness
to
depart
he
had
a
clue
ordinarily
gubb
would
have
taken
any
disguise
that
seemed
to
him
best
suited
for
the
work
in
hand
but
now
he
was
going
to
see
and
be
seen
by
syrilla
gubb
ran
down
the
list
number
seven
card
sharp
number
nine
minister
of
the
gospel
number
twelve
butcher
number
sixteen
negro
number
seventeen
chinese
laundryman
number
twenty
cowboy
philo
gubb
paused
there
he
would
be
a
cowboy
for
it
was
a
jaunty
disguise
chaps
sombrero
spurs
buckskin
gloves
holsters
and
pistols
blue
shirt
yellow
hair
stubby
mustache
he
donned
the
complete
disguise
put
his
street
garments
in
a
suitcase
and
viewed
himself
in
his
small
mirror
he
highly
approved
of
the
disguise
he
touched
his
cheeks
with
red
to
give
himself
a
healthy
outdoor
appearance
early
the
next
morning
before
the
earliest
merchants
had
opened
their
shops
philo
gubb
boarded
the
train
for
west
higgins
for
it
was
there
the
world
greatest
combined
shows
were
to
appear
the
few
sleepy
passengers
did
not
open
their
eyes
the
conductor
as
he
took
gubb
ticket
merely
remarked
joining
the
show
at
west
higgins
and
passed
on
boys
were
already
gathering
on
the
west
higgins
station
platform
when
the
train
pulled
in
and
they
cheered
gubb
thinking
him
part
of
the
show
this
greatly
increased
the
difficulty
of
gubb
detective
work
he
had
hoped
to
steal
unobserved
to
the
circus
grounds
but
a
dozen
small
boys
immediately
attached
themselves
to
him
running
before
him
and
whooping
with
joy
boys
said
gubb
sternly
i
wish
you
to
run
away
and
play
elsewhere
than
in
front
of
me
continuously
and
all
the
time
and
they
cheered
because
he
had
spoken
only
the
glad
news
that
the
circus
trains
had
reached
town
finally
dragged
them
reluctantly
away
detective
gubb
hurried
to
the
circus
grounds
the
cook
tent
was
already
up
and
the
grub
tent
was
being
put
up
presently
the
tent
was
up
and
the
big
top
rising
it
was
not
until
nine
however
that
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
began
to
appear
and
when
they
arrived
they
went
at
once
to
the
grub
tent
and
seated
themselves
at
the
table
from
a
corner
of
the
big
top
side
wall
detective
gubb
watched
them
look
there
dearie
said
syrilla
suddenly
to
princess
zozo
that
cowboy
look
like
gubb
that
was
at
bardville
and
got
the
golf
cup
it
do
look
like
him
said
princess
zozo
it
is
him
why
you
ask
him
to
come
over
and
help
at
the
eats
you
seemed
to
like
him
yesterday
i
thought
he
was
a
real
gentlemun
dearie
if
that
what
you
mean
said
syrilla
and
raising
her
voice
she
called
to
gubb
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
and
then
he
came
forward
we
knowed
you
the
minute
we
seen
you
gubb
come
and
sit
in
beside
me
and
have
some
breakfast
if
you
ai
dined
i
thought
you
went
home
last
night
you
ai
after
no
more
are
you
there
are
variously
many
ends
to
the
deteckative
business
said
gubb
as
he
seated
himself
beside
syrilla
i
upon
a
most
important
case
at
the
present
time
syrilla
reached
for
her
fifth
boiled
potato
and
as
her
arm
passed
gubb
face
he
thrilled
he
had
not
been
mistaken
upon
that
arm
was
a
pair
of
eagle
claws
tattooed
in
red
and
blue
how
little
these
had
meant
to
him
before
and
how
much
they
meant
now
i
presume
you
do
hardly
ever
long
for
a
home
in
one
place
miss
syrilla
he
began
with
his
eye
fixed
on
her
arm
just
above
the
elbow
well
believe
me
dearie
said
syrilla
you
do
want
to
think
that
just
because
i
travel
with
a
i
do
long
for
the
refinements
of
a
true
home
just
like
other
folks
some
folks
think
easy
to
see
through
and
that
i
ai
nothin
but
fat
and
appetite
but
they
got
me
down
wrong
gubb
i
was
unfortunate
in
gettin
lost
from
my
father
and
mother
when
a
babe
but
many
is
the
time
i
said
to
zozo
got
a
refined
strain
in
my
nature
have
i
zozo
you
say
it
every
time
we
begin
to
rag
you
about
fallin
in
love
with
every
new
thin
man
you
see
said
princess
zozo
you
said
it
last
night
when
we
was
joshin
you
about
gubb
here
syrilla
colored
but
gubb
thrilled
joyously
just
the
same
dearie
syrilla
said
to
princess
zozo
i
got
myself
listed
right
when
i
say
i
got
a
refined
nature
i
got
all
the
instincts
of
a
real
society
lady
and
sometimes
it
irks
me
awful
not
to
be
able
to
let
myself
loose
and
bant
like
pant
asked
gubb
was
the
word
i
used
gubb
syrilla
replied
maybe
you
would
guess
it
lookin
at
me
shovelin
in
the
eatables
this
way
but
eatin
food
is
the
croolest
thing
i
have
to
do
it
jars
me
somethin
terrible
yes
dearie
what
i
long
for
day
and
night
is
a
chance
to
take
my
place
in
the
social
stratums
i
was
born
for
and
bant
off
the
fat
like
other
social
ladies
is
doin
right
along
i
do
eat
food
because
i
like
it
gubb
but
because
a
lady
in
a
profession
like
mine
has
got
to
keep
fatted
up
my
outside
may
be
fat
gubb
but
i
got
a
soul
inside
of
me
as
skinny
as
any
lady
would
care
to
have
and
as
soon
as
possible
i
goin
to
quit
the
road
and
bant
off
six
or
seven
hundred
pounds
would
you
believe
it
possible
that
i
ai
dared
to
eat
a
pickle
for
over
seven
years
because
it
might
start
me
on
the
thinward
road
i
presume
to
suppose
said
gubb
politely
that
if
you
was
to
be
offered
a
home
that
was
rich
with
wealth
and
i
was
to
take
you
there
and
place
you
beside
your
parental
father
you
would
refuse
gubb
awaited
the
reply
with
eagerness
he
tried
to
remain
calm
but
in
spite
of
himself
he
was
nervous
watch
me
said
syrilla
if
you
could
show
me
a
nook
like
that
you
could
hold
me
in
this
show
business
with
a
and
bull
tackle
but
that
a
rosy
dream
you
ai
got
a
locket
with
the
photo
of
your
mother
picture
into
it
asked
gubb
no
said
syrilla
my
pa
and
ma
was
unknown
to
me
i
dare
say
they
got
sick
of
hearin
me
bawl
and
left
me
on
a
doorstep
the
first
i
knew
of
things
was
that
i
was
travelin
with
a
show
representin
a
newborn
babe
in
an
incubator
machine
i
was
incubated
up
to
the
time
i
was
five
years
old
and
got
too
long
to
go
in
the
glass
case
but
some
one
was
your
guardian
in
charge
of
you
no
doubt
asked
gubb
i
had
forty
of
them
dearie
said
syrilla
whenever
money
run
low
they
quit
because
they
could
get
paid
on
saturday
night
hah
said
gubb
and
does
the
name
jones
bring
back
the
memory
of
any
rememberance
to
you
no
gubb
said
syrilla
regretfully
seeing
how
eager
he
was
it
do
in
that
state
of
the
case
of
things
said
gubb
i
got
to
go
over
to
that
and
sit
down
and
think
awhile
i
got
a
certain
clue
i
got
to
think
over
and
make
sure
it
leads
right
and
if
it
does
i
have
something
important
to
say
to
you
the
in
question
was
attached
to
a
canvas
wagon
near
by
and
detective
gubb
seated
himself
on
it
and
thought
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
having
finished
entered
the
tent
with
the
exception
of
syrilla
who
remained
to
finish
her
meal
she
ate
a
great
deal
at
meals
before
meals
and
after
meals
gubb
from
his
seat
on
the
looked
at
syrilla
thoughtfully
he
had
not
the
least
doubt
that
syrilla
was
the
lost
daughter
of
jones
or
medderbrook
as
he
now
called
himself
the
tattoo
artist
had
sworn
to
complete
the
eagle
by
putting
its
claws
on
jones
daughter
if
need
be
and
here
were
the
claws
on
arm
but
just
as
it
is
desirable
at
times
to
have
a
handwriting
expert
identify
a
bit
of
writing
gubb
felt
that
if
he
could
prove
that
the
claws
tattooed
on
syrilla
arm
were
the
work
of
schreckenheim
his
case
would
be
complete
he
longed
for
schreckenheim
presence
but
lacking
that
he
had
a
happy
idea
enderbury
the
tattooed
man
of
the
should
be
a
connoisseur
and
would
perhaps
be
able
to
identify
the
eagle
claws
leaving
syrilla
still
eating
gubb
entered
the
tent
enderbury
seated
on
a
blue
property
case
was
engaged
in
biting
the
entire
row
of
finger
nails
on
his
right
hand
and
a
frown
creased
his
brow
he
was
enwrapped
by
a
long
purple
bathrobe
which
tied
closely
about
his
neck
as
he
caught
sight
of
gubb
he
started
slightly
and
doubled
his
hand
into
a
fist
but
he
immediately
calmed
himself
and
assumed
a
nonchalant
air
as
a
matter
of
fact
enderbury
led
a
dog
life
for
years
he
had
loved
syrilla
devotedly
but
he
was
so
bashful
he
had
never
dared
to
confess
his
love
to
her
and
year
after
year
he
saw
her
smile
upon
one
thin
man
after
another
now
it
was
lonergan
again
it
was
winterberry
or
it
was
gubb
or
smith
or
jones
or
doe
but
for
enderbury
she
seemed
to
have
nothing
but
contempt
enderbury
had
first
seen
her
when
she
was
posing
in
the
infant
incubator
and
had
loved
her
even
then
for
he
was
twenty
when
she
was
but
five
the
coming
of
a
new
rival
always
affected
him
as
the
coming
of
gubb
had
but
for
good
reason
he
hated
gubb
worse
than
any
of
the
others
excuse
me
for
begging
your
pardon
said
gubb
but
in
the
deteckative
business
questions
have
to
be
asked
have
you
ever
chanced
to
happen
to
notice
some
tattoo
work
upon
the
arm
of
miss
syrilla
of
this
i
have
said
enderbury
shortly
a
pair
of
eagle
claws
said
gubb
can
you
tell
me
from
your
knowledge
and
belief
if
the
work
there
done
was
the
work
of
a
herr
schreckenheim
i
can
tell
you
if
i
want
to
said
enderbury
what
do
you
want
to
know
for
if
those
claws
are
the
work
of
herr
schreckenheim
said
gubb
i
am
prepared
to
offer
to
miss
syrilla
her
daughterly
place
in
a
home
of
wealth
at
riverbank
iowa
if
those
claws
are
schreckenheim
claws
miss
syrilla
is
the
daughter
of
jonas
medderbrook
of
the
said
burg
beyond
the
question
of
a
particle
of
doubt
enderbury
looked
at
gubb
with
surprise
that
non
he
began
and
if
schreckenheim
did
those
claws
take
syrilla
away
from
this
show
forever
he
asked
i
will
said
philo
gubb
if
she
desires
to
wish
to
go
then
i
have
nothing
whatever
to
say
said
enderbury
and
he
shut
his
mouth
firmly
nor
would
he
say
more
do
you
desire
to
wish
me
to
understand
that
they
are
not
the
work
of
herr
schreckenheim
persisted
gubb
i
have
nothing
to
say
said
enderbury
i
consider
that
conclusive
circumstantial
evidence
that
they
are
said
detective
gubb
and
he
clanked
out
of
the
syrilla
was
still
seated
at
the
grub
table
finishing
her
meal
and
gubb
seated
himself
opposite
her
as
delicately
as
he
could
he
told
of
jonas
medderbrook
and
his
lost
daughter
of
the
home
of
wealth
that
awaited
that
daughter
and
finally
of
his
belief
that
syrilla
was
that
daughter
it
was
clear
that
syrilla
was
quite
willing
to
take
up
a
life
of
refinement
and
dieting
if
she
was
given
an
opportunity
such
as
gubb
was
able
to
offer
in
the
name
of
jonas
medderbrook
and
this
being
so
he
questioned
her
regarding
the
eagle
claws
gubb
she
said
i
wish
to
die
on
the
spot
if
i
know
how
i
got
them
claws
tattooed
onto
me
if
you
ask
me
i
say
it
is
the
mystery
of
my
life
they
been
on
me
since
i
was
a
little
girl
no
bigger
than
why
who
is
that
gubb
turned
his
head
quickly
but
he
was
not
in
time
to
see
a
plump
looking
little
slip
quickly
out
of
sight
behind
the
cook
tent
neither
did
he
see
the
glitter
of
the
sun
on
a
large
silver
golf
cup
the
plump
carried
under
his
arm
but
the
had
recognized
gubb
even
through
his
disguise
of
a
cowboy
no
matter
said
syrilla
but
these
claws
have
been
on
my
arm
since
i
was
a
wee
little
girl
gubb
i
always
thought
they
was
a
trademark
of
a
hospital
i
was
not
knowingly
aware
that
hospitals
had
trademarks
said
gubb
maybe
they
do
said
syrilla
but
when
i
was
a
small
child
i
had
an
accident
and
had
to
be
took
to
a
hospital
and
it
was
until
after
that
that
anybody
saw
the
eagle
claws
on
me
i
considered
that
maybe
it
was
like
the
mark
the
laundry
puts
on
a
handkerchief
it
has
laundered
i
do
know
much
about
the
manners
of
the
ways
of
hospitals
admitted
gubb
and
that
may
be
so
but
i
have
another
idea
did
you
ever
hear
of
herr
schreckenheim
only
that
enderbury
is
always
cross
on
the
days
of
the
month
that
he
gets
schreckenheim
statements
of
money
due
schreckenheim
is
the
man
that
tattooed
enderbury
so
beautiful
but
poor
enderbury
has
never
been
able
to
pay
him
in
full
philo
gubb
arose
i
am
going
to
telegraph
medderbrook
to
come
on
to
west
higgins
immediately
by
the
three
afternoon
train
he
said
and
you
will
meet
him
as
your
paternal
father
and
arrange
to
make
your
home
with
him
as
soon
as
you
desire
to
wish
it
at
five
that
afternoon
medderbrook
escorted
by
gubb
entered
the
tent
the
lady
and
gentlemen
freaks
were
resting
before
evening
grub
and
all
were
gathered
around
syrilla
platform
for
the
news
that
she
was
to
leave
the
show
to
enter
a
home
of
wealth
and
refinement
had
spread
quickly
syrilla
herself
was
in
tears
now
that
the
time
had
come
she
was
loath
to
part
from
her
kind
companions
i
tell
you
gubb
medderbrook
said
as
they
entered
the
if
you
have
indeed
found
my
daughter
you
have
made
me
a
happy
man
you
can
not
know
how
lonesome
my
life
has
been
now
which
is
she
she
is
the
female
lady
in
the
pink
satin
dress
on
that
platform
said
gubb
medderbrook
looked
toward
syrilla
and
gasped
why
that
that
the
fat
woman
that
the
fat
woman
of
the
he
exclaimed
i
thought
i
why
my
daughter
would
be
a
fat
woman
in
a
but
she
is
said
gubb
great
scott
exclaimed
medderbrook
for
years
medderbrook
had
retained
a
memory
of
his
daughter
as
he
had
seen
her
last
a
tender
babe
in
long
clothes
as
he
rode
toward
west
higgins
however
he
had
thought
about
his
daughter
and
he
had
revised
his
conception
of
her
she
was
older
now
of
course
and
he
had
finally
settled
the
matter
by
deciding
that
she
would
be
a
dainty
slip
of
a
girl
probably
a
walker
or
one
of
the
in
the
grand
spectacle
or
perhaps
even
engaged
as
the
beauty
but
a
fat
lady
medderbrook
walked
toward
syrilla
every
eye
in
the
tent
was
upon
him
there
was
utter
silence
except
for
syrilla
happy
sobbing
shess
said
a
voice
suddenly

vot

or

make
troubles
the
voice
came
from
outside
the
tent
and
with
surprising
agility
detective
gubb
dived
under
the
platform
and
wriggled
under
the
canvas
wall
i
do
owe
you
a
cent
exclaimed
the
voice
of
enderbury

collect
ten
dollars

claws
from
syrilla
und
how
does

get
those
claws
on

asked
herr
schreckenheim
shrewdly
i
tell
you
how
said
enderbury
you
remember
when
griggs
barton
circus
burned
down
years
ago
well
syrilla
was
burned
in
that
fire
burned
on
the
arm
and
they
took
her
to
a
hospital
and
her
arm
would
heal
so
somebody
had
to
furnish
some
skin
for
a
job
and
i
did
it
the
piece
they
took
had
those
claws
on
it
that
what
happened
i
gave
those
eagle
claws
to
cure
her
and
i
hung
around
her
all
these
years
like
a
faithful
dog
and
she
do
care
a
hang
for
me
and
now
she
going
away
go
and
collect
for
those
claws
from
her
i
have
got
them
she
going
to
be
rich
she
can
pay
you
simultaneously
there
was
an
exclamation
from
medderbrook
a
cry
from
syrilla
and
a
short
sharp
yell
from
outside
the
tent
gubb
entered
spurs
first
creeping
backward
under
the
canvas
as
he
backed
from
under
the
platform
it
was
observed
that
he
held
a
shoe
about
no
size
in
one
hand
and
that
a
foot
was
in
the
shoe
and
the
foot
on
a
leg
and
the
leg
on
a
short
plump
elderly
who
yelled
as
he
was
dragged
into
the
tent
on
his
back
in
one
hand
of
the
was
a
large
silver
golf
cup
with
a
deep
dent
on
one
side
as
gubb
arose
to
his
feet
still
holding
the
tattoo
artist
foot
in
his
hand
he
said
medderbrook
the
deteckative
business
is
not
always
completely
satisfactory
in
all
kinds
of
respects
and
it
looks
as
if
it
appeared
that
the
daughter
i
found
for
you
is
somebody
else
but
if
you
will
look
at
the
other
end
of
the
assaulter
and
batterer
i
have
in
hand
you
will
see
that
i
have
recovered
the
silver
golf
cup
trophy
once
again
for
the
second
time
and
that
said
medderbrook
as
he
took
the
cup
from
the
hand
is
remarkable
work
the
ordinary
detective
is
usually
satisfied
to
recover
stolen
property
once
but
you
have
recovered
this
cup
twice
the
motto
of
my
deteckative
business
said
gubb
modestly
is
no
matter
how
many
times
gubb
might
have
said
more
but
he
was
interrupted
by
princess
zozo
the
snake
charmer
who
had
walked
around
syrilla
and
unhooked
two
of
the
hooks
at
the
top
of
syrilla
gown
look
she
exclaimed
and
she
pointed
to
a
second
pair
of
claws
tattooed
between
syrilla
shoulder
blades
without
a
word
medderbrook
took
five
hundred
dollars
from
his
purse
and
handed
them
to
schreckenheim
that
pays
you
for
the
cup
he
said
and
then
turning
to
syrilla
come
to
my
arms
my
daughter
after
syrilla
had
hugged
her
father
affectionately
gubb
and
the
freaks
laid
him
on
the
ground
and
by
fanning
him
vigorously
were
able
to
bring
him
back
to
life
medderbrook
first
act
upon
opening
his
eyes
was
to
hold
out
his
hand
to
gubb
thank
you
gubb
he
panted
it
a
big
price
but
i
keep
my
word
the
ten
thousand
dollars
shall
be
yours
into
ordinary
circumstances
said
gubb
gravely
ten
thousand
dollars
would
be
a
largely
big
price
to
pay
for
recovering
back
a
lost
daughter
medderbrook
but
into
the
present
case
it
do
amount
to
more
than
ten
dollars
per
pound
of
daughter
which
ai
a
largely
great
rate
per
pound
the
oubliette
the
discovery
that
syrilla
was
the
daughter
of
jonas
medderbrook
born
jones
was
a
great
triumph
for
philo
gubb
but
while
the
riverbank
eagle
made
a
great
hurrah
about
it
philo
gubb
was
not
entirely
happy
over
the
matter
having
won
a
reward
of
ten
thousand
dollars
for
discovering
syrilla
and
five
hundred
dollars
for
recovering
medderbrook
golf
cup
gubb
might
have
ventured
to
tell
syrilla
of
his
love
for
her
but
for
three
reasons
the
first
reason
was
that
gubb
was
so
bashful
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
speak
his
love
openly
and
immediately
if
syrilla
had
returned
to
riverbank
with
her
father
gubb
would
have
courted
her
by
degrees
or
if
syrilla
had
weighed
only
two
hundred
pounds
gubb
might
have
had
the
bravery
to
propose
to
her
instantly
but
she
weighed
one
thousand
pounds
and
it
required
five
times
the
bravery
to
propose
to
a
thousand
pounds
that
was
required
to
propose
to
two
hundred
pounds
the
second
reason
was
that
dorgan
the
manager
of
the
would
not
release
syrilla
from
her
contract
she
a
beauty
of
a
fat
lady
said
dorgan
and
i
got
a
contract
with
her
and
i
going
to
hold
her
to
it
medderbrook
and
gubb
would
have
been
quite
hopeless
when
dorgan
said
this
if
syrilla
had
not
taken
them
to
one
side
listen
dearies
she
said
he
a
mean
old
brute
but
do
you
fret
i
got
a
hunch
how
to
make
him
cancel
my
contract
in
a
perfectly
refined
an
ladylike
manner
right
now
i
start
in
bantin
and
in
the
manner
an
the
way
i
can
lose
three
or
four
hundred
pounds
when
i
set
out
to
do
it
is
something
grand
it
wo
be
no
time
at
all
until
i
thin
and
an
dorgan
will
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
me
this
information
greatly
cheered
gubb
while
he
admired
syrilla
just
as
she
was
a
rapid
mental
calculation
assured
him
that
she
would
still
be
quite
plump
at
seven
hundred
pounds
and
he
knew
he
could
love
seven
tenths
of
syrilla
more
than
he
could
love
ten
tenths
of
any
other
lady
in
the
world
the
third
reason
had
to
do
with
the
reward
when
gubb
and
medderbrook
were
proceeding
homeward
on
the
train
medderbrook
brought
up
the
subject
of
the
reward
again
i
going
to
pay
you
that
ten
thousand
dollars
gubb
he
said
but
i
going
to
pay
it
so
it
will
be
worth
a
lot
more
than
ten
thousand
dollars
to
you
you
are
very
overly
kind
said
gubb
it
because
i
know
you
are
fond
of
syrilla
said
medderbrook
gubb
blushed
so
i
ai
going
to
give
you
ten
thousand
dollars
in
cash
said
medderbrook
i
going
to
do
a
lot
better
by
you
than
that
i
going
to
give
you
stock
the
only
trouble
stock
sounds
quite
elegantly
nice
said
gubb
the
only
trouble
said
medderbrook
is
that
the
stock
i
want
to
give
you
is
in
a
block
of
thousand
dollars
nice
stock
it
as
neatly
engraved
as
any
stock
i
ever
saw
and
it
is
genuine
common
stock
in
the
utterly
hopeless
company
the
name
sounds
sort
of
unhopeful
ventured
gubb
timidly
that
shows
you
do
know
anything
about
gold
mines
said
medderbrook
cheerfully
the
reason
i
the
reason
the
miners
gave
it
that
name
is
because
this
mine
lies
right
between
two
of
the
best
in
minnesota
one
of
them
is
the
utterly
good
and
the
other
is
the
so
when
i
so
when
the
miners
named
this
mine
they
took
part
of
the
names
of
the
two
others
and
called
this
one
the
utterly
hopeless
that
the
way
i
the
way
it
is
always
done
it
very
cleverly
bright
said
gubb
it
an
old
trick
i
should
say
an
old
and
approved
method
said
medderbrook
so
what
i
going
to
do
gubb
is
to
let
you
in
on
the
ground
floor
on
this
mine
it
a
chance
i
would
offer
to
everybody
this
mine
has
paid
out
all
its
money
in
dividends
i
tell
you
as
an
actual
fact
gubb
that
so
far
it
has
paid
out
a
cent
in
dividends
not
even
to
the
preferred
stock
no
sir
and
it
ai
one
of
these
mines
that
has
been
mined
until
all
the
gold
is
mined
out
of
it
no
sir
not
an
ounce
of
gold
has
ever
been
taken
out
of
the
utterly
hopeless
mine
not
an
ounce
it
is
all
there
yet
exclaimed
gubb
all
there
ever
was
said
medderbrook
yes
sir
if
you
want
me
to
i
give
you
a
written
guarantee
that
the
utterly
hopeless
mine
has
never
paid
a
cent
in
dividends
and
that
not
an
ounce
of
gold
has
ever
been
taken
out
of
the
mine
that
shows
you
i
square
about
this
so
what
i
going
to
do
he
said
impressively
is
to
turn
over
to
you
a
block
of
thousand
dollars
worth
of
utterly
hopeless
stock
and
apply
the
ten
thousand
dollars
i
owe
you
as
part
of
the
purchase
price
all
you
need
to
do
then
is
to
pay
me
the
other
fifteen
thousand
dollars
as
rapidly
as
you
can
that
very
kindly
generous
of
you
said
gubb
gratefully
and
that
is
all
said
medderbrook
i
own
every
single
share
of
the
stock
of
that
mine
gubb
and
as
soon
as
you
get
the
fifteen
thousand
dollars
paid
up
i
advance
the
price
of
that
stock
one
hundred
per
cent
yes
sir
i
double
the
price
of
the
stock
and
what
you
own
will
be
worth
fifty
thousand
dollars
there
were
tears
in
philo
gubb
eyes
as
he
grasped
hand
and
all
i
ask
said
medderbrook
is
that
you
hustle
up
and
pay
that
fifteen
thousand
dollars
as
quick
as
you
can
so
that
he
added
you
be
worth
fifty
thousand
dollars
all
the
sooner
upon
reaching
riverbank
medderbrook
took
gubb
to
his
home
and
turned
over
to
him
the
stock
in
the
utterly
hopeless
mine
and
here
said
medderbrook
is
a
receipt
for
ten
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
and
you
can
give
me
back
that
five
hundred
i
paid
you
for
recovering
of
my
golf
cup
that
to
show
you
everything
is
fair
and
square
when
you
deal
with
me
now
you
owe
me
only
fourteen
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
while
gubb
was
handing
the
five
hundred
dollars
back
to
medderbrook
the
colored
butler
entered
with
a
telegram
medderbrook
tore
it
open
hastily
good
news
already
he
said
and
handed
it
to
gubb
it
was
from
syrilla
and
said
be
brave
have
lost
four
ounces
already
kind
regards
and
best
love
to
gubb
with
only
partial
satisfaction
gubb
left
medderbrook
and
proceeded
downtown
he
now
had
a
double
incentive
for
seeking
the
rewards
that
fall
to
detectives
for
he
had
syrilla
to
win
and
the
utterly
hopeless
stock
to
pay
for
he
started
for
the
for
he
was
hungry
but
on
the
way
certain
suspicious
actions

henry
the
liveryman
who
had
twice
beaten
him
up
while
he
was
working
on
the
dynamiter
case
stopped
him
and
it
was
much
later
when
he
entered
the
as
philo
gubb
entered
billy
getz
sat
on
one
of
the
stools
and
stirred
his
coffee
he
held
a
dime
novel
with
his
other
hand
reading
but
pete
kept
an
eye
on
him
he
knew
billy
getz
and
his
practical
jokes
if
unwatched
for
a
moment
the
young
might
empty
the
salt
into
the
or
play
some
other
prank
that
came
under
his
idea
of
fun
billy
getz
was
a
good
example
of
the
spoiled
only
son
he
went
in
for
all
the
vice
there
was
in
town
and
to
occupy
his
spare
time
he
planned
practical
jokes
he
was
thirty
years
old
rather
bald
had
a
pale
and
leathery
skin
and
a
preternaturally
serious
expression
in
his
pranks
he
was
aided
by
the
group
of
young
fellows
known
as
the
kidders
billy
getz
as
he
read
the
last
line
of
the
thrilling
tale
of
the
pale
avengers
tucked
the
book
in
his
pocket
and
looked
up

he
shouted
and
in
one
leap
was
over
the
counter
and
crouching
behind
it
billy
getz
turned
toward
the
door
where
a
short
man
was
standing
with
a
pine
slab
held
in
his
hand
intense
anger
glittered
in
his
eyes
and
he
darted
to
the
counter
and
leaning
over
brought
the
slab
down
on
philo
gubb

with
a
resounding
whack

winked
at
joe
henry
you
let

explain
to
gubb
an
if
he
ai
satisfied
why
all
right
for
a
moment
joe
henry
studied
face
and
then
he
put
down
the
slab
all
right
you
explain
he
said
ungraciously
and
philo
gubb
raised
his
white
face
above
the
counter
upon
the
passage
of
the
state
prohibitory
law
every
saloon
in
riverbank
had
been
closed
and
there
had
been
growlings
from
the
saloon
element
five
of
the
leading
prohibitionists
had
received
threatening
letters
and
a
few
nights
later
the
houses
of
four
of
the
five
were
blown
up
kegs
of
powder
had
been
placed
in
the
cellar
windows
of
each
of
the
four
houses
wrecking
them
and
the
fifth
house
was
saved
only
because
the
fuse
there
was
damp
luckily
no
one
was
killed
but
that
was
not
the
fault
of
the
dynamiters
as
every
one
called
them
the
town
and
state
immediately
offered
a
reward
of
five
thousand
dollars
for
the
arrest
and
conviction
of
the
dynamiters
and
detectives
flocked
to
riverbank
real
detectives
came
to
try
for
the
noble
prize
amateur
detectives
came
in
hordes
citizens
who
were
not
detectives
at
all
tried
their
hands
at
the
work
for
the
first
few
days
rumors
of
the
immediate
capture
of
the
ghouls
were
flying
everywhere
but
day
followed
day
and
week
followed
week
and
no
one
was
incarcerated
the
went
back
to
their
ordinary
occupations
the
amateur
detectives
went
home
the
real
detectives
were
called
off
on
other
and
more
promising
jobs
and
soon
the
field
was
left
clear
for
philo
gubb
not
that
he
made
much
progress
each
night
he
hid
himself
in
the
dark
doorway
of
willcox
hall
waiting
to
pick
up
lesson
four
rule
four
some
person
and
having
picked
him
up
he
proceeded
to
trail
and
shadow
him
lesson
four
rules
four
to
seventeen
six
times
twice
by
joe
henry
he
was
well
beaten
by
those
he
followed
it
became
such
a
nuisance
to
be
followed
by
philo
gubb
in
false
mustache
or
whiskers
that
it
was
a
public
relief
when
billy
getz
and
other
young
fellows
took
upon
themselves
the
duty
of
being
shadowed
with
hats
pulled
over
their
eyes
and
turned
up
they
would
pass
the
dark
doorway
of
willcox
hall
let
themselves
be
picked
up
and
then
lead
poor
detective
gubb
across
vacant
lots
over
mud
flats
or
among
dark
lumber
piles
only
to
give
him
the
slip
with
infinite
ease
when
they
tired
of
the
game
but
philo
gubb
was
back
the
next
night
waiting
in
the
shadow
of
the
doorway
of
willcox
hall
he
did
not
progress
very
rapidly
toward
the
goal
of
the
reward
but
he
counted
it
all
good
practice
but
being
beaten
twice
in
succession
by
joe
henry
aroused
his
suspicion
joe
henry
ran
a
small
carting
business
he
had
three
teams
and
three
drays
and
a
small
stable
on
locust
street
on
the
alley
corner
he
was
a
great
friend
of
pete
and
he
ate
at
the
philo
gubb
after
leaving
medderbrook
had
not
intentionally
picked
up
joe
henry
on
his
way
to
the
it
had
been
necessary
for
him
to
pass
the
alley
opposite
joe
henry
stable
and
his
detective
instinct
told
him
to
hide
himself
behind
a
manure
bin
in
the
alley
and
watch
the
stable
in
the
warm
june
dusk
he
had
crouched
there
watching
and
waiting
gubb
could
see
into
the
stable
but
there
was
not
much
to
see
the
stable
boy
sat
at
the
door
his
chair
tipped
back
until
a
few
minutes
after
eleven
when
one
of
joe
henry
drays
drove
up
with
a
load
of
baled
hay
philo
gubb
heard
the
voices
of
the
men
as
they
hoisted
the
hay
to
the
and
he
saw
joe
henry
helping
with
the
the
hay
was
water
dripped
from
it
onto
the
floor
of
the
stable
but
nothing
exciting
occurred
and
philo
gubb
was
about
to
consider
this
a
dull
evening
work
when
joe
henry
appeared
in
the
doorway
a
pitchfork
in
one
hand
and
the
slab
of
pine
in
the
other
he
looked
up
and
down
the
street
and
then
with
surprising
agility
sprang
across
the
street
toward
where
philo
gubb
lay
hid
with
a
wild
cry
philo
gubb
fled
the
pitchfork
clattered
at
his
feet
but
missed
him
and
he
had
every
advantage
of
long
legs
and
speed
his
heels
clattered
on
the
alley
pave
and
joe
henry
clattered
farther
and
farther
behind
at
each
leap
of
the
correspondence
school
detective
all
right
you
explain
said
joe
henry
sullenly
now

joe
henry
frowned
and
pete
shook
his
head
if

my
advice
gubby
he
said
you

case
right
here
an
now

of
fear
i
ca

that
if
them
gools

me
i
object

a
dangerous
employment
and

he
went
out
and
closed
the
door
there
said
pete
ai
that
better
than
beatin
him
up

said
joe
henry
grudgingly
chances
are
he
such
a
dummy
he
go
right
ahead
follerin
me
he
needs
a
good
scare
thrown
into
him
billy
getz
slid
from
his
stool
and
ran
his
hands
deep
into
his
pockets
jingling
a
few
coins
and
a
bunch
of
keys
want
me
to
scare
him
he
asked
pleasantly
say
you
can
do
it
too
said
joe
henry
eagerly
you
the
feller
that
can
kid
him
to
death
go
ahead
if
you
do
i
give
you
a
case
of
six
star
ai
that
so
pete
absolutely
said
that
a
bet
said
billy
getz
pleasantly
leave
it
to
the
kidders
philo
gubb
went
straight
to
his
room
at
the
widow
murphy
and
having
taken
off
his
shoes
and
coat
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
his
feet
on
the
bed
and
opened
the
pale
avengers
he
had
never
before
read
a
dime
novel
and
this
opened
a
new
world
to
him
he
read
breathlessly
the
style
of
the
story
was
somewhat
like
this
the
picture
on
the
wall
swung
aside
and
detective
brown
stared
into
the
muzzles
of
two
revolvers
and
the
sharp
eyes
of
the
youngest
of
the
pale
avengers
a
thrill
of
horror
swept
through
the
detective
he
felt
his
doom
was
at
hand
but
he
did
not
cringe
your
time
has
come
said
the
avenger
be
not
too
sure
said
detective
brown
haughtily
are
you
ready
to
die
ever
ready
the
detective
extended
his
hand
toward
the
table
on
which
his
revolver
lay
a
cruel
laugh
greeted
him
it
was
the
last
human
voice
he
was
to
hear
as
if
by
magic
the
floor
under
his
feet
gave
way
down
down
down
a
thousand
feet
he
was
precipitated
he
tried
to
grasp
the
walls
of
masonry
but
in
vain
nothing
could
stay
him
as
he
plunged
into
the
deep
water
of
the
oubliette
a
fiendish
laugh
echoed
in
his
ears
the
pale
avengers
had
destroyed
one
more
of
their
adversaries
until
he
read
this
thrilling
tale
philo
gubb
had
not
guessed
the
fiendishness
of
malefactors
when
brought
to
bay
and
yet
here
it
was
in
black
and
white
the
oubliette
a
dark
dank
dungeon
hidden
beneath
the
ground
was
a
favorite
method
of
killing
detectives
it
seemed
generally
speaking
the
oubliette
seemed
to
be
the
prevailing
fashion
in
vengeful
murder
sometimes
the
bed
sank
into
the
oubliette
sometimes
the
floor
gave
way
and
cast
the
victim
into
the
oubliette
sometimes
the
whole
room
sank
slowly
into
the
oubliette
but
death
for
the
victim
always
lurked
in
the
pit
before
getting
into
bed
philo
gubb
examined
the
walls
the
floor
and
the
ceiling
of
his
room
they
seemed
safe
and
secure
but
twice
during
the
night
he
awoke
with
a
cry
imagining
himself
sinking
through
the
floor
three
nights
later
as
philo
gubb
stood
in
the
dark
doorway
of
the
willcox
building
waiting
to
pick
up
any
suspicious
character
billy
getz
slipped
in
beside
him
and
drew
him
hastily
to
the
back
of
the
entry
hush
not
a
word
he
whispered
did
you
see
a
man
in
the
window
across
the
street
the
third
window
on
the
top
floor
no
whispered
philo
gubb
was
was
there
one
with
a
rifle
whispered
billy
getz
ready
to
pick
you
off
come
it
is
suicide
for
you
to
try
to
go
out
the
front
way
now
follow
me
i
have
news
for
you
step
quietly
he
led
the
through
the
back
corridor
to
the
open
air
and
up
the
outside
back
stairs
to
the
third
floor
and
into
the
building
he
tapped
lightly
on
a
door
and
it
was
opened
the
merest
crack
friends
whispered
billy
getz
and
the
door
opened
wide
and
admitted
them
the
room
was
the
of
the
kidders
where
they
gathered
night
after
night
to
play
cards
and
drink
illicit
whiskey
green
shades
over
which
were
hung
heavy
curtains
protected
the
windows
a
large
round
table
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
under
the
a
couch
was
in
one
corner
of
the
room
and
these
with
the
chairs
and
a
formless
heap
in
a
far
corner
over
which
a
was
thrown
constituted
all
the
furniture
except
for
the
iron
cuspidors
here
the
young
fellows
came
for
their
sport
feeling
safe
from
intrusion
for
the
possession
of
whiskey
was
against
the
law
there
was
a
fine
of
five
hundred
dollars
one
half
to
the
informer
for
the
misdemeanor
of
having
whiskey
in
one
possession
but
the
kidders
had
no
fear
they
knew
each
other
for
the
moment
the
cards
were
put
away
and
the
hid
the
four
cases
of
six
star
that
represented
the
club
stock
of
liquor
the
five
young
men
already
in
the
room
were
sitting
around
the
table
sit
down
detective
gubb
said
billy
getz
here
we
are
safe
here
we
may
talk
freely
and
we
have
something
big
to
talk
philo
gubb
moved
a
chair
to
the
table
he
had
to
push
one
of
the
cuspidors
aside
to
make
room
and
as
he
pushed
it
with
his
foot
he
saw
an
oblong
of
paper
lying
in
it
among
the
sand
and
cigar
stubs
it
was
a
six
star
whiskey
label
he
turned
his
head
from
it
with
his
twist
of
the
neck
and
let
his
eyes
rest
on
billy
getz
we
know
who
dynamited
those
houses
said
billy
getz
suddenly
do
you
know
jack
harburger

said
philo
gubb

do
know

well

do
said
billy
getz
he
the
slickest
ever
he
was
the
boss
of
the
gang
read
this
he
slid
a
sheet
of
across
to
philo
gubb
and
the
detective
read
it
slowly
billy
send
me
five
hundred
dollars
quick
i
got
to
get
away
from
here
and
we
made
him
our
friend
said
billy
getz
resentfully
why
he
was
here
the
night
of
the
dynamiting
was
he
boys
he
sure
was
said
the
kidders
now
he
nothing
to
us
said
billy
getz
now
what
do
you
say
detective
gubb
if
we
fix
it
so
you
can
grab
him
will
you
split
the
reward
with
us
half
for
you
and
half
for
me
asked
philo
gubb
his
eyes
as
big
as
poker
chips
three
thousand
for
you
and
two
for
us
was
what
we
figured
was
fair
said
billy
getz
you
ought
to
have
the
most
you
put
in
your
experience
and
your
education
in
detective
work
and
that
ought
to
be
worth
something
admitted
philo
gubb
so
it
was
agreed
they
explained
to
philo
gubb
that
jack
harburger
was
the
son
of
old
harburger
of
the
harburger
house
at
derlingport
and
that
they
could
count
on
the
clerk
of
that
hotel
to
help
them
billy
getz
would
go
up
and
get
things
ready
and
the
next
day
philo
gubb
would
appear
at
the
hotel
in
disguise
of
course
and
do
his
part
the
clerk
would
give
him
a
room
next
to
jack
harburger
room
and
see
that
there
was
a
hidden
opening
in
the
partition
and
billy
getz
pretending
he
was
bringing
the
money
would
wring
a
full
confession
from
jack
harburger
then
philo
gubb
need
only
step
into
the
room
and
snap
the
handcuffs
on
jack
harburger
and
collect
the
reward
they
shook
hands
all
finally
and
billy
getz
went
to
the
window
to
see
that
no
ghoul
was
lurking
in
the
street
ready
to
murder
philo
gubb
when
he
went
out
as
he
turned
away
from
the
window
the
toe
of
his
shoe
caught
in
the
fringe
of
the
and
dragged
it
partially
from
the
pile
in
the
corner
with
a
quick
sweep
of
his
hand
billy
getz
replaced
the
cover
but
not
before
philo
gubb
had
seen
the
necks
of
a
full
case
of
bottles
and
had
caught
the
glint
of
the
label
on
one
of
them
bearing
the
six
silver
stars
like
that
in
the
cuspidor
billy
getz
cast
a
quick
glance
at
the
correspondence
school
detective
face
but
philo
gubb
his
head
well
back
on
his
stiff
neck
was
already
gazing
at
the
door
two
days
later
philo
gubb
with
his
telescope
valise
in
his
hand
boarded
the
morning
train
for
derlingport
the
river
was
on
one
of
its
rampages
and
the
water
came
close
to
the
tracks
here
and
there
on
the
way
to
derlingport
the
water
was
over
the
tracks
and
in
many
places
the
which
followed
the
railway
was
completely
swamped
and
the
passing
vehicles
sank
in
the
muddy
water
to
their
hubs
the
year
is
still
known
as
the
year
of
the
big
flood
in
riverbank
the
water
had
flooded
the
front
street
cellars
and
in
derlingport
the
sewers
had
backed
up
flooding
the
entire
lower
part
of
the
town
when
the
train
reached
derlingport
philo
gubb
with
his
telescope
valise
which
contained
his
twelve
correspondence
school
lessons
the
pale
avengers
a
pair
of
handcuffs
his
revolver
and
three
extra
disguises
walked
toward
the
harburger
house
he
was
already
thoroughly
disguised
wearing
a
beard
and
a
red
mustache
and
an
wig
with
long
hair
luckily
he
passed
no
one
with
that
disguise
he
would
have
drawn
an
immense
crowd
nothing
like
it
had
ever
been
seen
on
the
streets
of
derlingport
or
elsewhere
for
that
matter
a
full
block
away
philo
gubb
saw
the
sign
of
the
hotel
and
he
immediately
became
cautious
as
a
detective
should
he
crossed
the
street
and
observed
the
exits
there
was
a
main
entrance
on
the
corner
a
ladies
entrance
at
the
side
and
an
entrance
to
what
had
once
been
the
from
the
one
could
drop
to
the
street
without
great
injury
philo
gubb
noted
all
these
and
then
walked
to
the
alley
there
were
two
doors
opening
on
the
alley
one
a
cook
door
and
the
other
evidently
leading
to
the
cellar
at
the
latter
a
dray
stood
and
as
philo
gubb
paused
there
two
men
came
from
this
door
and
laid
a
bale
of
hay
on
the
dray
pushing
it
forward
carefully
they
did
not
toss
it
carelessly
onto
the
dray
but
slid
it
onto
the
dray
and
the
hay
was
wet
moreover
the
two
men
were
two
of
joe
henry
men
and
that
was
odd
it
was
odd
that
joe
henry
should
send
a
dray
the
full
thirty
miles
to
derlingport
to
get
a
load
of
wet
hay
when
he
could
get
all
the
dry
hay
he
wanted
in
riverbank
but
it
did
not
impress
philo
gubb
he
hurried
to
the
main
entrance
of
the
hotel
and
entered
the
lobby
of
the
harburger
house
was
large
and
gloomy
in
its
woodwork
except
for
one
man
sitting
at
a
desk
by
the
window
and
writing
industriously
and
the
clerk
behind
the
counter
the
lobby
was
untenanted
to
the
left
a
huge
stairway
led
to
the
gloom
above
for
the
hotel
boasted
no
elevator
except
the
huge
baggage
lift
which
had
been
put
in
in
the
palmy
days
of
the
house
when
the
great
river
packets
were
still
a
business
factor
philo
gubb
walked
across
the
lobby
to
the
clerk
desk
the
industrious
penman
by
the
window
glanced
over
his
shoulder
he
looked
more
like
a
hotel
clerk
than
like
a
traveling
salesman
but
philo
gubb
gave
this
no
thought
the
clerk
behind
the
desk
put
his
fingers
on
his
lips
sh
he
whispered
are
you
detective
gubb
good
i
been
expecting
you
have
you
a
gun
in
my
telescope
case
whispered
philo
gubb
take
this
one
said
the
clerk
handing
the
a
glittering
revolver
be
careful
come
i
show
you
the
room
he
came
from
behind
the
desk
and
picked
up
philo
gubb
telescope
valise
and
led
the
way
up
the
dingy
stairway
luckily
for
billy
great
practical
joke
philo
gubb
had
never
seen
jack
harburger
or
he
would
have
recognized
him
in
the
plump
little
man
carrying
his
telescope
valise
up
three
flights
of
dark
stairs
jack
harburger
led
philo
gubb
and
at
the
landing
of
the
fourth
floor
he
stopped
illustration
these
here
is
false
whiskers
and
hair
you
were
taking
a
risk
a
big
risk
coming
undisguised
he
said
but
i
am
disguised
said
philo
gubb
these
here
is
false
whiskers
and
hair
what
exclaimed
jack
harburger
wonderful
work
a
splendid
detective
you
fooled
me
with
it
and
i
was
on
my
guard
you
do
bend
down
like
an
old
man
that
it
now
listen
i
have
cut
a
hole
through
the
wall
from
your
room
into
jack
you
can
hear
every
word
he
speaks
have
you
pencil
and
paper
good
jot
down
every
word
you
hear
and
do
make
a
sound
if
you
are
discovered
well
they
a
desperate
gang
come
he
led
the
way
through
a
long
dark
corridor
that
turned
and
twisted
at
the
extreme
end
he
stopped
put
down
the
telescope
valise
and
drew
a
key
from
his
pocket
that
jack
room
he
breathed
softly
and
you
go
in
here
sorry
it
is
a
better
room
we
had
to
use
it
and
you
wo
be
here
long
anyway
he
opened
the
door
it
was
a
large
door
that
swung
outward
and
it
occupied
one
half
of
one
side
of
the
room
the
floor
of
the
room
was
carpeted
and
the
walls
were
papered
as
was
the
ceiling
there
was
no
window
but
an
electric
light
burned
in
the
center
of
the
ceiling
across
the
far
side
of
the
room
stood
a
narrow
iron
bed
with
a
small
bureau
beside
it
jack
harburger
pointed
to
a
hole
in
the
that
your
he
whispered
and
philo
gubb
stepped
into
the
room
instantly
the
door
slammed
behind
him
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
and
he
heard
a
heavy
iron
bar
clank
as
it
fell
into
place
outside
he
was
a
prisoner
caught
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
and
he
knew
it
he
threw
himself
against
the
door
but
it
did
not
give
the
electric
light
above
his
head
went
dark
he
put
out
his
hand
and
the
wall
gave
slightly
he
drew
the
revolver
and
waited
dreading
what
might
next
occur
he
heard
soft
footsteps
outside
the
door
and
raising
the
revolver
pulled
the
trigger
the
trigger
snapped
harmlessly
he
had
been
tricked
tricked
all
around
is
the
oubliette
prepared
whispered
a
voice
outside
all
ready
for
him
twelve
feet
of
water
he
drown
like
a
rat
good
a
slow
death
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
like
we
served
the
other
two
then
get
rid
of
his
body
the
same
way
a
stone
on
it
and
the
river
yes
they
never
come
up
again
the
voices
died
away
along
the
corridor
and
philo
gubb
was
left
in
utter
silence
oubliette
the
fate
of
the
detectives
of
the
pale
avengers
was
to
be
his
suddenly
the
room
began
to
quiver
the
floor
and
the
walls
trembled
and
creaked
and
philo
gubb
threw
himself
once
more
against
the
door
he
shouted
and
beat
upon
it
with
his
hands
inch
by
inch
creaking
and
swaying
the
room
glided
downward
the
door
seemed
to
glide
upward
beyond
the
ceiling
giving
place
to
a
solid
wall
he
turned
and
beat
on
the
side
of
the
room
and
it
gave
forth
a
hollow
sound
as
he
moved
the
room
swayed
under
his
feet
he
was
doomed
alone
in
the
darkness
his
fear
suddenly
gave
way
to
a
feeling
of
pride
he
was
dangerous
enough
then
to
be
thought
worthy
of
death
his
last
drop
of
doubt
oozed
out
of
his
mind
he
was
he
must
be
a
great
detective
or
such
means
would
not
have
been
taken
to
get
rid
of
him
he
felt
a
sort
of
calm
joy
in
this
his
murderers
knew
his
prowess
locked
in
the
room
going
down
to
certain
death
he
exulted
and
if
he
was
as
great
as
all
that
it
could
not
be
that
his
position
was
hopeless
time
and
again
carl
carroll
the
boy
detective
had
been
in
equally
precarious
positions
but
in
the
end
he
had
brought
the
pale
avengers
low
and
what
a
boy
untrained
could
do
a
graduate
of
the
rising
sun
correspondence
school
of
detecting
ought
to
be
able
to
do
he
drew
his
knife
from
his
pocket
and
cut
into
the
of
the
side
wall
being
a
the
first
touch
of
his
hand
against
the
side
wall
had
told
him
the
was
pasted
on
canvas
and
not
on
a
solid
wall
and
now
he
ripped
the
canvas
away
the
wall
was
of
rough
boards
scarred
and
marred
the
opposite
wall
was
the
same
he
kneeled
on
the
bed
and
tried
the
rear
wall
he
felt
the
plastered
wall
gliding
upward
he
stood
on
the
bed
and
ripped
the
canvas
ceiling
away
as
he
ripped
the
ceiling
away
light
entered
the
cage
from
a
dirty
skylight
far
above
just
over
his
head
a
heavy
iron
grating
covered
the
cage
barring
him
in
but
high
up
he
could
see
the
great
drum
from
which
the
cable
slowly
unwound
as
the
car
descended
he
was
in
an
elevator
but
this
knowledge
gave
him
small
comfort
cage
room
or
elevator
call
it
what
he
chose
it
was
relentlessly
descending
into
the
flooded
cellar
he
watched
the
drum
with
fascinated
eyes
as
the
wire
cable
unwound
itself
he
lay
back
on
the
bed
his
feet
hanging
to
the
floor
and
stared
upward
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
the
revolving
drum
it
was
like
a
clock
marking
the
moments
he
still
had
to
live
but
suddenly
he
was
galvanized
into
action
over
his
feet
something
cold
ran
making
him
jerk
them
from
the
floor
it
was
the
water
of
the
oubliette
and
he
gazed
on
it
with
horror
as
it
rose
inch
by
inch
toward
him
slowly
as
the
car
dropped
the
water
crept
up
it
reached
the
first
drawer
of
the
small
bureau
it
crept
up
to
the
side
rails
of
the
bed
it
wet
the
mattress
and
still
it
rose
he
stood
on
the
bed
and
grasped
the
iron
grating
above
his
head
stop
whispered
a
voice
above
his
head
and
the
creaking
cage
stopped
gubb
detective
gubb
whispered
the
voice
and
philo
gubb
looked
upward
listen
detective
gubb
said
the
voice
one
touch
of
my
hand
on
the
lever
and
you
will
be
dropped
beneath
the
waters
never
to
appear
again
except
dead
one
only
chance
remains
for
your
life
and
blackened
with
crime
though
we
are
we
offer
you
that
chance
if
you
will
swear
to
leave
the
state
never
to
return
we
will
spare
you
what
say
you
philo
gubb
it
was
an
offer
no
mortal
could
refuse
life
after
all
is
sweet
philo
gubb
the
relentless
correspondence
school
detective
opened
his
mouth
but
as
he
turned
his
head
upward
he
closed
it
again
and
licked
his
lips
twice
no
durn
ye
he
shouted
angrily
i
wo
never
do
no
such
thing
there
was
a
hurried
whispering
of
many
voices
above
him
think
well
said
the
voice
again
we
will
give
you
until
midnight
to
reconsider
your
rashness
until
midnight
detective
gubb
you
ca
scare
shouted
philo
gubb
until
midnight
repeated
the
voice
and
then
there
was
silence
philo
gubb
immediately
drew
his
heavy
from
his
pocket
and
began
cutting
out
one
of
the
panels
of
the
door
that
shut
him
in
on
one
side
he
did
not
work
hurriedly
he
was
not
at
all
frightened
looking
up
he
had
seen
the
drum
and
there
was
no
more
cable
on
the
drum
to
be
unwound
the
car
could
descend
no
farther
his
feet
were
as
wet
as
they
could
get
unless
the
river
rose
to
unbelievable
height
he
could
not
be
drowned
in
the
makeshift
oubliette
unless
he
voluntarily
lay
down
in
the
shallow
water
and
inhaled
it
he
worked
on
the
panel
slowly
but
with
the
earnestness
of
a
very
angry
victim
of
a
hoax
the
panel
fell
outward
with
a
splash
and
floated
away
philo
gubb
bent
sideways
and
squeezed
out
of
the
small
opening
into
the
cellar
the
huge
cellar
was
dusky
in
the
dim
light
that
entered
through
the
cobwebbed
panes
high
in
the
wall
it
was
an
immense
place
and
now
in
water
except
for
a
gangway
of
boards
laid
on
low
trestles
which
led
from
one
side
of
the
cellar
to
the
cellar
door
there
were
and
like
watery
bays
leading
from
the
general
cellar
sea
and
strange
appliance
to
discover
in
a
hotel
cellar
a
small
press
stood
on
an
extemporized
platform
against
one
wall
and
alongside
it
on
a
long
table
such
as
are
seen
in
factories
bales
of
hay
some
complete
and
some
torn
open
and
cases
the
cases
were
labeled
blue
river
canned
tomatoes
but
one
split
across
the
end
gave
evidence
that
their
contents
were
not
canned
tomatoes
at
all
through
the
crack
in
the
case
glittered
the
six
silver
stars
of
the
six
star
whiskey
there
were
of
the
cases
philo
gubb
waded
to
the
raised
gangway
and
walked
to
the
cellar
door
it
was
on
the
inside
and
he
lifted
the
bars
cautiously
and
stepped
into
the
alley
closing
the
door
carefully
behind
him
he
pulled
his
false
whiskers
and
wig
from
his
face
and
stuffed
them
in
his
pockets
and
hurried
down
the
alley
when
he
returned

getz
jack
harburger
and
six
of
the
kidders
were
holding
high
revel
in
the
closed
of
the
harburger
house
but
they
all
fell
silent
when
the
door
opened
and
the
sheriff
of
derling
county
entered
with
philo
gubb
and
three
deputies
in
company
it
was
evident
that
the
sheriff
did
not
consider
philo
gubb
a
joke
jack
he
said
to
harburger
detective
gubb
of
riverbank
has
been
doing
some
sleuthing
in
your
hotel
he
says
we
want
to
have
a
look
at
the
cellar
the
next
morning
the
riverbank
eagle
was
full
of
philo
gubb
again
through
the
superb
acumen
of
that
wonderful
detective
three
stores
of
whiskey
had
been
discovered
and
confiscated
one
in
the
cellar
of
the
harburger
house
at
derlingport
one
in
joe
henry
stable
at
riverbank
and
a
smaller
one
in
the
room
in
the
willcox
building
frequented
by
the
kidders
how
i
done
it
said
philo
gubb
to
one
of
his
admirers
i
done
it
like
a
deteckative
does
it
a
deteckative
that
wants
to
detect
picks
up
some
feller
that
looks
like
it
says
in
lesson
four
rule
four
and
then
he
shadows
and
trails
him
like
it
says
in
lesson
four
rules
four
to
seventeen
and
then
somethin
bound
to
happen
but
how
can
you
tell
what
goin
to
happen
asked
his
admirer
well
sir
said
philo
gubb
that
the
beauty
of
the
deteckative
business
you
do
ever
know
what
goin
to
happen
until
it
happens
the
although
detective
gubb
experience
with
the
did
not
lead
to
the
detection
of
the
dynamiters
for
whom
a
reward
of
five
thousand
dollars
was
offered
it
resulted
in
the
payment
to
him
of
one
half
of
three
fines
of
five
hundred
dollars
for
each
of
the
three
stores
of
whiskey
he
had
unearthed
with
this
money
amounting
to
seven
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
gubb
went
to
the
home
of
jonas
medderbrook
and
paid
that
gentleman
the
entire
amount
that
there
payment
gubb
said
deducted
from
what
i
owe
onto
them
shares
of
perfectly
worthless
stock
the
name
of
the
mine
if
you
please
is
utterly
hopeless
and
not
perfectly
worthless
said
medderbrook
severely
just
so
said
gubb
apologetically
you
must
excuse
me
medderbrook
i
ai
no
expert
onto
names
and
offhand
them
two
names
seem
about
the
same
to
me
but
my
remark
was
to
be
that
the
indebtedness
of
the
liability
i
now
owe
you
is
only
thirteen
thousand
seven
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
and
the
sooner
you
get
it
paid
up
the
better
it
will
suit
me
said
medderbrook
yes
sir
said
gubb
and
hesitated
then
assuming
an
air
of
little
concern
he
asked
it
ai
likely
to
suppose
we
had
any
word
from
miss
syrilla
is
it
mr
medderbrook
for
answer
medderbrook
went
to
his
desk
and
brought
gubb
a
telegram
it
was
from
syrilla
it
said
eating
no
potatoes
drinking
no
water
have
lost
eight
pounds
kind
love
to
gubb
she
wore
herself
down
to
nine
hundred
and
pounds
according
to
that
said
gubb
she
has
only
got
to
wear
off
two
hundred
and
pounds
more
before
dorgan
will
discharge
her
away
from
the
and
at
the
rate
she
is
wearing
herself
away
said
medderbrook
that
will
be
in
about
ten
years
what
interests
me
more
is
that
the
telegram
came
collect
and
cost
me
forty
cents
if
you
want
to
do
the
square
thing
gubb
you
pay
me
twenty
cents
for
your
share
of
that
telegram
gubb
immediately
gave
medderbrook
twenty
cents
and
medderbrook
kindly
allowed
him
to
keep
the
telegram
gubb
placed
it
in
the
pocket
nearest
his
heart
and
proceeded
to
a
house
on
tenth
street
where
he
had
a
job
of
at
about
this
same
time
smith
wittaker
the
riverbank
marshal
or
chief
of
police
as
he
would
have
been
called
in
a
larger
city
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
against
the
edge
of
his
desk
in
the
dingy
marshal
room
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
city
hall
and
grinned
at
griscom
one
of
citizens
well
i
do
know
he
said
with
a
grin
i
do
know
but
what
be
glad
to
be
like
that
i
guess
it
was
just
somebody
playing
a
joke
on
you
if
it
was
said
griscom
i
am
ready
to
do
a
little
joking
myself
i
just
enough
of
a
joker
to
want
to
see
whoever
it
was
in
jail
my
house
is
my
house
it
is
my
castle
as
the
saying
is
and
i
do
want
strangers
wandering
in
and
out
of
it
whether
they
come
to
take
away
my
property
or
leave
property
that
is
not
mine
is
there
or
is
there
not
a
law
against
such
things
as
happened
at
my
house
oh
there
a
law
all
right
said
marshal
wittaker
it
burglary
whether
the
burglar
breaks
into
your
house
or
breaks
out
of
it
how
do
you
know
he
broke
out
well
my
wife
and
i
went
to
the
riverbank
theater
last
night
said
griscom
and
when
i
got
home
and
went
to
put
the
key
in
the
keyhole
there
was
another
key
in
it
here
are
the
two
keys
marshal
wittaker
took
the
two
keys
and
examined
them
one
was
an
old
doorkey
much
worn
and
the
other
a
new
key
evidently
the
work
of
an
amateur
all
right
said
marshal
wittaker
when
he
had
examined
the
keys
this
new
one
was
made
out
of
an
old
spoon
go
ahead
we
never
had
a
key
like
that
in
the
house
said
griscom
but
when
we
reached
home
last
night
this
key
was
sticking
in
the
lock
of
the
front
door
on
the
outside
and
the
door
was
unlocked
and
standing
ajar
just
as
if
some
one
had
gone
in
at
the
front
door
and
left
it
unlocked
said
wittaker
exactly
said
griscom
so
the
first
thing
we
thought
was
and
the
first
place
my
wife
looked
was
the
sideboard
in
the
and
there
yes
said
wittaker
there
on
the
sideboard
were
a
dozen
solid
silver
spoons
you
had
never
seen
before
and
marked
with
my
wife
initials
understand
said
griscom
and
the
cellar
window
the
one
on
the
east
side
of
the
house
had
been
broken
out
of
why
not
broken
into
asked
the
marshal
well
i
not
quite
a
fool
said
griscom
with
some
heat
i
know
because
of
the
marks
his
jimmy
made
on
the
sill
some
one
has
been
playing
a
joke
on
you
said
wittaker
you
wait
and
you
see
you
wo
be
offended
if
i
ask
you
a
question
my
wife
knows
no
more
about
it
than
i
do
said
griscom
hotly
now
now
said
wittaker
soothingly
i
did
mean
that
what
are
your
own
spoons
solid
or
plated
plated
said
griscom
well
said
wittaker
there
where
to
look
for
the
joke
try
to
think
who
would
consider
it
a
joke
to
send
you
solid
silver
spoons
billy
getz
exclaimed
griscom
mentioning
the
town
joker
that
the
man
i
had
in
mind
said
wittaker
now
i
guess
you
can
handle
this
alone
mr
griscom
i
guess
i
can
agreed
griscom
and
he
went
out
the
marshal
chuckled
he
said
to
himself
that
a
new
one
for
sure
the
sort
of
burglary
to
set
philo
gubb
the
on
he
was
still
grinning
as
he
went
out
but
he
tried
to
hide
the
grin
when
he
met
billy
getz
on
main
street
billy
uttered
a
hasty
stop
now
wittaker
but
the
head
of
the
riverbank
police
grasped
his
arm
what
your
rush
i
got
some
fun
for
you
said
wittaker
some
other
time
said
billy
i
just
borrowed
this
from
doc
mortimer
and
promised
to
take
it
back
quick
what
is
it
asked
the
marshal
gazing
at
the
curious
affair
billy
had
in
his
hands
it
looked
very
much
like
a
coffeepot
and
on
the
lid
was
a
wheel
like
a
small
tin
windmill
just
below
the
lid
and
above
the
spout
was
a
hole
as
large
as
a
dime
said
billy
trying
to
pull
away
let
me
go
will
you
wittaker
i
in
a
hurry
just
borrowed
it
to
settle
a
bet
with
sam
simmons
i
show
two
pounds
more
lung
pressure
than
he
does
pounds
you
scoffed
wittaker
i
bet
i
can
show
if
you
can
show
oh
well
i
suppose
i
ca
get
away
until
baby
tries
the
new
toy
but
hurry
up
will
you
the
marshal
put
his
lips
to
the
spout
and
blew
instantly
from
the
hole
under
the
lid
a
great
cloud
of
flour
shot
out
covering
his
face
and
head
and
deluging
his
garments
from
up
and
down
the
street
came
shouts
of
joy
and
the
marshal
brushing
at
his
face
grinned
one
on
me
billy
he
said
patting
the
flour
out
of
his
hair
and
just
when
i
was
coming
to
put
you
onto
some
fun
too
what
do
you
know
about
the
griscom
not
a
thing
billy
said
tell
me
i
did
expect
you
would
know
anything
about
it
said
the
marshal
with
a
wink
but
how
about
putting
correspondence
school
detective
gubb
onto
the
job
fine
said
billy
tell
me
what
the
griscom
thing
is
and
i
do
the
rest
billy
found
philo
gubb
at
work
in
the
house
on
tenth
street
hanging
paper
on
the
second
floor
and
the
lank
detective
looked
at
billy
solemnly
as
the
story
of
the
griscom
affair
was
explained
to
him
when
i
started
in
takin
lessons
from
the
rising
sun
deteckative
agency
correspondence
school
of
deteckating
said
gubb
solemnly
i
aimed
to
do
a
strictly
retail
business
in
deteckating
and
let
the
wholesale
alone
seeing
that
you
learned
by
mail
said
billy
getz
i
should
think
you
be
better
fitted
to
do
a
business
them
terms
of
retail
and
wholesale
is
my
own
said
gubb
you
do
believe
anybody
would
a
house
i
guess
said
billy
yes
i
do
philo
gubb
said
a
fellow
can
tie
a
knot
or
he
can
it
ca
he
he
can
hitch
a
horse
or
he
can
it
and
if
a
man
can
burgle
he
can
a
mercenary
burglar
would
naturally
burgle
things
out
of
a
house
after
he
had
burgled
himself
in
but
a
burglar
would
just
as
naturally
things
into
a
house
and
then
himself
out
that
stands
to
reason
of
course
it
does
said
billy
getz
and
i
knew
you
would
see
it
that
way
i
see
things
reasonable
said
philo
gubb
but
i
guess
i
wo
take
up
the
case
ai
no
common
crime
it
ai
mentioned
in
the
twelve
lessons
i
got
from
the
rising
sun
correspondence
school
i
would
hardly
know
how
to
go
about
catching
an
just
do
the
opposite
from
what
it
says
to
do
to
catch
a
burglar
said
billy
getz
common
sense
would
tell
you
that
would
it
but
listen
gubb
i
let
wittaker
catch
his
own
burglars
the
reason
i
ask
you
to
take
this
case
is
because
i
know
you
have
a
good
heart
it
good
but
it
hard
said
philo
gubb
a
deteckative
has
to
have
a
hard
heart
all
right
here
is
this
man
houses
for
all
we
know
he
is
honest
and
upright
said
billy
getz
he
continues
houses
the
habit
grows
each
house
he
tempts
him
to
two
each
set
of
spoons
he
leaves
in
a
house
tempts
him
to
leave
two
sets
in
the
next
house
or
four
sets
or
a
solid
silver
in
a
short
time
he
wipes
out
his
little
fortune
he
borrows
he
begs
at
last
he
steals
in
order
to
one
house
he
burgles
another
he
leads
a
dual
life
a
sort
of
life
but
what
if
i
caught
him
said
gubb
oh
you
wo
catch
i
mean
we
will
leave
that
to
you
frighten
him
out
of
the
habit
i
tell
marshal
wittaker
you
will
get
on
the
trail
yes
said
philo
gubb
i
feel
sorry
for
the
feller
maybe
lettin
his
wife
and
children
suffer
for
food
whilst
he
away
his
substance
then
said
billy
getz
taking
up
his
suppose
you
stop
in
at
the
marshal
office
at
wittaker
will
tell
you
all
about
it
philo
gubb
waited
until
billy
was
well
out
of
the
house
and
then
he
said
he
done
it
and
i
know
he
done
it
and
he
done
it
to
make
a
fool
out
of
me
but
i
guess
i
owe
billy
getz
a
scare
and
if
i
can
prove
that
onto
him
he
get
the
scare
all
right
detective
gubb
when
it
was
time
to
go
to
the
marshal
office
pinned
his
large
star
on
his
vest
put
three
false
beards
in
his
pocket
and
went
the
marshal
received
him
cordially
billy
getz
was
there
you
understand
said
wittaker
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
putting
you
on
this
case
but
i
want
to
ask
you
to
report
to
me
every
evening
i
could
write
out
a
docket
said
philo
gubb
that
what
them
french
deteckatives
did
always
good
idea
said
wittaker
write
out
a
docket
and
bring
it
in
every
night
now
i
go
over
this
griscom
case
so
you
understand
how
to
go
at
it
here
for
instance
is
the
house
the
clock
on
the
marshal
desk
marked
ten
before
they
were
aware
billy
had
arisen
from
his
chair
for
he
had
a
poker
game
waiting
for
him
at
the
kidders
club
when
the
telephone
bell
rang
the
marshal
drew
the
toward
him

the
telephone

broke
out
through
a
cellar
window
yes

understand
no
it
does
seem
possible
but
such
things
have
happened
i
send
he
looked
around
but
philo
gubb
who
had
heard
the
name
and
address
was
already
gone
i
attend
to
it
at
once
he
concluded
and
hung
up
the
receiver
he
turned
to
billy
getz
billy
he
said
severely
is
this
another
of
your
jokes
wittaker
said
billy
i
give
you
my
word
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
well
i
believe
you
said
wittaker
rather
reluctantly
i
thought
it
was
you
who
do
you
suppose
is
trying
to
take
the
honor
of
town
from
you
i
ca
imagine
said
billy
are
you
going
to
leave
the
thing
in
gubb
hands
that
detective
not
much
it
is
getting
serious
i
send
purcell
up
to
look
the
ground
over
a
man
ca
make
keys
and
break
out
of
houses
and
leave
engraved
spoons
and
forks
around
without
leaving
plenty
of
traces
we
have
the
man
and
give
him
a
good
scare
detective
gubb
in
the
meanwhile
had
gone
directly
to
house
at
locust
avenue
millbrook
a
short
stout
man
with
a
husky
voice
that
gurgled
when
he
was
excited
opened
the
door
i
deteckative
gubb
of
the
rising
sun
deteckative
correspondence
school
of
deteckating
come
to
see
about
your
said
philo
gubb
opening
his
coat
to
show
his
badge
this
is
a
most
peculiar
case
i
never
heard
anything
like
it
in
my
life
gurgled
millbrook
did
take
a
thing

a
dozen
spoons

in
at
the
front
door
and
broke

gubb
seating
himself
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
and
drawing

notebook
and
pencil
married
married
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
asked
millbrook
twenty
years

june
if
you
want
to
know
that
makes
it
a
difficult
case
said
philo
gubb
if
you
was
a
bride
and
a
groom
it
would
be
easier
but
i
guess
maybe
you
can
tell
me
the
names
of
some
of
the
folks
you
had
to
dinner
dinner

had
thousands
to

dining
out
and
giving

is
our
favorite
amusement
i
ca

mean
i
ca
understand

plated
spoons

said
detective
gubb
griscom
house
was
last
night
and
he
had
plated
spoons
the
left
solid
ones
on
him
like
he
did
on
you
now
i
reason
like
sherlock
holmes
you
both
got
plated
spoons
an
leaves
you
solid
ones
so
he
must
have
known
you
had
plated
ones
and
needed
solid
ones
so
it
must
be
some
one
who
has
had
dinner
with
you
my
dear
man
gurgled
millbrook
we
never
have
had
a
plated
spoon
in
this
house
who
sent
you
here
anyway
nobody
said
philo
gubb
i
come
of
myself
well
you
can
go
of
yourself
gurgled
millbrook
angrily
there
the
door
get
out
on
his
way
out
gubb
met
patrolman
purcell
coming
in
illustration
who
sent
you
here
anyway
detective
gubb
outside
the
house
examined
the
cellar
window
as
well
as
he
could
there
was
not
a
mark
to
be
seen
from
the
outside
but
a
bore
the
marks
of
the
exit
to
get
out
of
the
cellar
the
had
had
to
wiggle
himself
out
of
the
small
window
and
had
crushed
the
pansies
flat
detective
gubb
felt
carefully
among
the
crushed
pansies
and
his
hand
found
something
hard
and
round
it
was
the
drumstick
bone
of
a
chicken
leg
detective
gubb
threw
it
away
even
an
would
not
have
chosen
a
chicken
leg
bone
as
a
weapon
evidently
billy
getz
had
not
left
any
clue
in
the
philo
gubb
had
no
doubt
that
billy
was
putting
up
a
joke
on
him
the
detective
decided
that
his
best
method
would
be
to
shadow
billy
getz
from
sundown
each
day
until
he
caught
him
another
house
or
found
something
to
connect
him
with
the
so
he
went
home
it
was
eleven
when
he
began
to
undress
it
was
then
he
first
realized
that
the
knees
of
his
light
trousers
were
damp
from
kneeling
in
the
and
he
looked
at
them
ruefully
the
knees
were
stained
like
joseph
coat
of
many
colors
and
they
were
his
best
trousers
he
hung
them
carefully
over
the
back
of
his
chair
and
went
to
bed
the
next
morning
he
rolled
the
trousers
in
a
bundle
and
took
them
with
him
on
his
way
to
his
job
on
main
street
he
stopped
at
frank
the
tailor
pants
cleaned
and
pressed
cents
he
unrolled
the
trousers
and
laid
them
across
the
counter
can
you
remove
those
stains
he
asked
oh

i
couldt
said
frank

press

said
philo
gubb
and
went
out
illustration
under
his
arm
he
carried
a
small
bundle
old
john
westcote
and
pansy
stains
on
his
trouser
knees
was
it
the
thing
seemed
impossible
but
so
did
for
that
matter
old
john
westcote
was
one
of
the
richest
men
in
riverbank
he
was
a
retired
merchant
and
as
mean
as
sin
he
was
the
last
man
in
riverbank
any
one
would
suspect
of
leaving
spoons
and
forks
in
other
houses
but
how
did
it
come
that
he
had
pansy
stains
on
the
knees
of
his
trousers
philo
gubb
thought
of
old
john
westcote
all
day
and
toward
night
he
hit
on
a
solution
wedding
presents
from
what
he
had
heard
old
john
was
or
had
been
the
sort
of
man
to
accept
a
wedding
invitation
go
to
the
reception
and
eat
his
fill
and
never
send
the
bride
so
much
as
a
black
wire
hairpin
and
now
grown
old
his
conscience
might
be
hurting
him
he
might
be
in
that
state
when
restitution
becomes
a
craze
and
the
ungiven
wedding
presents
might
press
upon
his
conscience
it
was
not
at
all
unlikely
that
he
had
chosen
the
method
of
giving
the
presents
at
this
late
date
the
form
of
the
goods
forks
and
spoons
and
the
initials
engraved
upon
them
made
this
more
likely
that
night
detective
gubb
did
not
report
in
person
or
by
docket
to
marshal
wittaker
at
seven
he
was
hiding
in
the
hazel
brush
opposite
old
john
westcote
lonely
house
on
pottex
lane
at
the
old
man
tottered
from
his
gate
and
tottered
down
the
lane
toward
the
more
thickly
settled
part
of
the
town
under
his
arm
he
carried
a
small
bundle
a
bundle
wrapped
in
newspaper
detective
gubb
waited
until
the
old
man
was
well
in
advance
and
then
slipped
from
the
hazel
brush
and
followed
him
observing
all
the
rules
for
shadowing
and
trailing
as
taught
by
the
rising
sun
detective
agency
correspondence
school
of
detecting
for
three
hours
the
old
man
wandered
the
streets
now
he
walked
along
main
street
peering
anxiously
into
the
faces
of
the
pedestrians
with
purblind
eyes
and
now
walking
the
residence
streets
detective
gubb
kept
close
behind
as
ten
struck
from
the
clock
in
the
high
school
tower
old
john
westcote
quickened
his
steps
a
little
and
walked
toward
the
opposite
end
of
the
town
where
the
are
down
the
hill
into
the
lumber
district
he
walked
and
detective
gubb
dodged
from
tree
to
tree
halfway
down
the
hill
the
old
man
hesitated
he
glanced
around
at
his
side
was
a
mass
of
lilac
bushes
seeming
strangely
out
of
place
among
the
huge
piles
of
lumber
without
stopping
the
old
man
let
the
bundle
slide
from
under
his
arm
and
fall
on
the
walk
for
a
moment
it
lay
like
a
white
spot
on
the
walk
and
then
it
moved
rapidly
out
of
sight
into
the
bushes
bundles
do
not
move
thus
unless
assisted
but
philo
gubb
was
too
far
away
to
see
the
hand
he
knew
must
have
reached
out
for
the
bundle
he
ran
rapidly
keeping
in
the
sawdust
that
formed
the
unfruitful
soil
of
the
until
he
dared
come
no
nearer
and
then
he
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
tallest
and
lay
flat
he
commanded
every
side
of
the
hillside
and
he
did
not
have
long
to
wait
from
the
lower
side
of
the
yard
he
saw
a
black
figure
emerge
cross
the
street
and
disappear
over
the
bank
into
the
railway
below
gubb
scrambled
down
and
followed
at
the
bank
above
the
he
paused
keeping
in
a
shadow
and
looked
here
and
there
flat
cars
and
box
cars
stood
on
the
tracks
in
great
numbers
most
of
them
closed
and
sealed
some
partly
open
he
heard
a
car
door
grate
as
it
was
closed
he
slipped
down
the
bank
and
crept
on
his
hands
and
knees
he
was
halfway
down
the
line
of
cars
when
he
heard
a
voice
it
came
from
car
b
q
run
all
the
breath
out
of
me
said
the
voice
in
a
wheeze
well

get
it
whispered
another
voice

i
got
it
got
something
anyway
strike
a
match
bill
and
see

say
i
never
thought
to
have
a
thousand
dollars
at
once
in
me
life
what
that
it
was
philo
gubb
slipping
the
car
door
latch
over
the
staple
and
hammering
home
the
hasp
with
a
rock
it
was
the
engine
backing
against
the
long
row
of
cars
to
make
a
coupling
and
then
moving
slowly
forward
toward
derlingport
as
the
heavy
train
got
under
way
the
two
rascals
hammered
on
the
side
of
the
car
with
their
fists
they
swore
they
kicked
against
the
doors
philo
gubb
drew
himself
into
the
next
open
car
as
the
train
moved
away
about
the
same
time
officer
purcell
entered
the
marshal
office
where
wittaker
and
billy
getz
sat
awaiting
the
coming
of
philo
gubb
purcell
led
john
gutman
the

comin
out

a
dream
he
was
to

i
tripped
over
a
wire
fence
cuttin
a
corner
an
fell
into
a
got
hail
columbia
from
the
lady
too
she
said
old
man
westcote

into
the
flowers
yesterday
and
she
did
mean
to

as
no
landin
place
heard
from
detective
gubb
yet
wittaker
grinned
we
ought
to
hear
from
him
soon
and
i
reckon

worth
waiting
to
hear
from
and
he
was
word
came
from
him
about
an
hour
later
it
was
a
telegram
from
the
sheriff
of
derling
county
detective
gubb

of
the
dynamiters

other
three
an
maybe
we
can
split
it
with
gubb
and
us
sitting
here
thinking
we
had
a
joke
on
him
exclaimed
marshal
wittaker
with
disgust
it
makes
me
sick
well
i
feel
a
little
bilious
myself
said
billy
getz
the
stamp
the
house
in
tenth
street
where
philo
gubb
was
doing
a
job
of
when
he
made
the
happy
error
of
capturing
the
dynamiters
while
seeking
the
was
the
home
of
aunt
martha
turner
a
member
of
the
ladies
temperance
league
of
riverbank
the
members
of
the
ladies
temperance
league
and
aunt
martha
turner
particularly
had
recently
begun
a
movement
to
have
city
attorney
mullen
impeached
and
thrown
out
of
office
for
they
claimed
that
while
he
had
been
elected
by
the
party
and
had
pledged
himself
to
close
every
saloon
he
had
not
closed
one
single
saloon
aunt
martha
turner
and
her
associates
believed
this
was
because
attorney
mullen
was
himself
a
drinker
of
beer
and
it
was
to
get
proof
of
this
that
the
ladies
had
engaged
a
youth
named
slippery
williams
to
make
a
raid
on
his
home
detective
gubb
was
however
quite
unconscious
of
all
this
when
he
proceeded
to
the
home
of
aunt
martha
to
complete
his
work
there
he
was
in
an
unhappy
frame
of
mind
for
he
had
in
his
pocket
nothing
but
one
stamp
and
he
had
immediate
need
for
one
hundred
dollars
gubb
had
early
that
morning
visited
the
home
of
medderbrook
from
whom
he
hoped
to
have
news
of
syrilla
but
the
colored
butler
informed
him
that
medderbrook
had
been
called
to
chicago
he
done
lef
word
howsomedever
said
the
butler
dat
ef
you
come
an
was
willin
to
pay
thutty
cents
you
could
have
dis
telegraf
whut
come
from
mis
syrilla
an
he
lef
dis
note
fo
you
whut
you
can
have
whever
you
pay
or
not
gubb
quite
willingly
gave
the
negro
thirty
cents
the
very
last
money
he
possessed
and
read
the
telegram
it
said
hope
on
hope
ever
have
given
up
wheat
bread
corn
bread
rye
bread
bread
bakers
bread
biscuit
and
rolls
have
lost
six
pounds
more
love
to
gubby
this
would
have
sent
gubb
to
his
work
in
a
happy
frame
of
mind
had
it
not
been
for
the
note
medderbrook
had
left
this
note
said
called
to
chicago
suddenly
i
must
have
one
hundred
dollars
payment
on
account
of
the
gold
stock
immediately
can
not
let
my
daughter
marry
a
man
who
puts
off
paying
for
gold
stock
forever
unless
i
hear
from
you
with
money
all
is
over
between
us
such
a
letter
would
have
made
any
lover
sad
gubb
had
no
idea
where
he
could
raise
one
hundred
dollars
during
the
day
and
he
saw
his
promising
romance
cut
short
just
when
syrilla
was
beginning
to
lose
weight
handsomely
the
greeting
he
received
when
he
reached
aunt
martha
turner
was
not
of
a
sort
to
cheer
him
turner
met
him
with
a
sour
face
no
you
ca
go
ahead
with
puttin
the
on
this
kitchen
ceilin
gubb
she
said
i
like
to
if
i
could
said
philo
gubb
wistfully
my
financial
condition
ai
such
as
to
allow
me
to
waste
a
day
i
very
low
in
a
monetary
shape
right
now
aunt
martha
turner
seemed
worried
well
she
said
reluctantly
i
guess
if
that
the
case
you
might
as
well
go
ahead
i
expect
i
have
to
be
out
of
the
house
all
day
if
you
get
done
before
i
get
back
lock
the
kitchen
door
and
put
the
key
behind
a
shutter
she
departed
and
philo
gubb
set
up
his
trestle
unrolled
and
trimmed
a
strip
of
pasted
it
and
climbed
his
ladder
at
the
top
he
seated
himself
a
moment
and
shook
his
head
he
sighed
and
picked
up
the
strip
of
but
before
he
could
get
to
his
feet
the
kitchen
door
opened
and
snooks
turner
put
his
head
in
cautiously
say
gubb
where
aunt
martha
he
asked
in
a
whisper
she
gone
out
said
philo
gubb
she
wo
be
back
for
quite
some
time
i
guess
snooksy
good
said
snooks
and
he
entered
the
kitchen
some
weeks
before
he
had
met
nan
kilfillan
he
was
deeply
in
love
with
nan
and
nan
was
a
good
girl
although
aunt
martha
turner
did
not
approve
of
her
because
she
was
hired
girl
to
city
attorney
mullen
before
she
had
met
snooks
nan
had
done
her
best
to
make
something
of
slippery
williams
who
was
courting
her
then
but
that
task
was
beyond
even
nan
powers
snooks
held
a
job
on
the
eagle
as
city
reporter
with
the
dignified
title
of
city
editor
and
he
was
making
good
he
got
the
news
he
seemed
able
to
smell
news
when
there
was
big
news
in
the
air
he
would
become
uneasy
and
feel
nervous
i
got
the
twitches
again
he
would
say
to
the
editor
of
the
eagle
there
some
big
item
around
i
got
to
get
it
and
he
would
get
it
she
gone
out
has
she
said
snooks
when
he
had
entered
his
kitchen
and
asked
philo
gubb
about
aunt
martha
that
good
i
wanted
to
see
you
on
a
matter
of
business
detective
business
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
drew
out
a
small
roll
of
bills
he
was
not
the
usually
neat
snooks
one
eye
was
blackened
and
one
side
of
his
face
was
scratched
his
clothes
were
badly
torn
and
soiled
he
looked
as
if
some
one
had
tried
to
murder
him
there
he
said
holding
the
bills
up
to
philo
gubb
after
counting
them
there
dollars

that
and
find
out
what
i
have
done
and
what
the
matter

all
about

you
want
me
to
find
out
asked
gubb
fondling
the
bills

knew

would
ask

snooks
peevishly

do
know
what
it
is

you
say

to
be
here
now
you
snooks
he
says

got
no
consideration
for
me
at
all
here
i
figgered
that
there
would
be
no
wave
of
crime
strike
town
for
some
days
and
i
went
and
took
the
jail
door
down
to
the
blacksmith
to
have
a
panel
put
in
where
the
one
rusted
out
and
my
wife
made
me
promise
to

to
the
farm
with
her
and

i
got
a
strong
imagination

door
bright
he
says
honor
bright
i
says
so
he
went
said
snooks
and
he
trusting
me
and
here
i
am
you
can
see
it
would
do
for
me
to
be
running
all
over
town
when
by
rights
i
locked
and
barred
and
bolted
in
jail
i
locked
and
barred
and
bolted
in
jail
and
well
started
on
my
way
to
the
penitentiary
as
a
burglar
as
a
burglar
exclaimed
gubb
that
it
said
snooks
i
ca
see
head
or
tail
of
it
you
got
to
help
me
out
gubb
see
if
you
can
make
any
sense
of
this
last
night
i
went
out
for
a
walk
with
nan
she
my
girl
you
know
and
she
going
to
marry
me
maybe
she
wo
now
but
she
was
going
to
she
works
for
mullen
we
got
back
to
mullen
house
about
eleven
and
mullen
always
locks
the
door
at
ten
whether
nan
is
in
or
not
so
being
late
we
had
to
ring
the
doorbell
and
mullen
came
to
the
door
to
let
nan
in
and
when
he
saw
i
was
with
her
he
shook
hands
with
me
and
asked
me
to
come
in
and
have
a
cigar
and
sit
awhile
but
i
told
him
i
had
to
hustle
up
some
news
for
paper
and
he
let
me
go
that
how
pleasant
he
was
so
i
went
downtown
and
the
first
fellow
i
met
was
sammy
wilmerton
widow
wilmerton
boy
asked
philo
gubb
exactly
said
snooks
feeling
his
eye
with
his
finger
and
he
says
did
you
hear
what
the
ladies
temperance
league
did
last
night
i
had
heard
heard
ma
say
says
sammy
do
say
i
told
you
they
got
up
a
petition
to
have
city
attorney
mullen
impeached
by
the
city
council
well
that
was
news
i
went
into
the
office
and
called
up
mullen
is
that
attorney
mullen
i
says
he
says
something
happened
last
night
i
says
i
like
to
see
you
about
it
do
you
know
what
happened
he
says

i
says
i
come
up
after
a
half
a
minute
he
says
yes
come
up
come
right
away
i
be
waiting
for
you
so
i
went
nothing
strange
about
that
said
philo
gubb
shifting
himself
on
the
ladder
so
i
went
continued
snooks
i
rang
the
doorbell
and
the
moment
it
rang
the
door
flew
open
and
down
came
a
over
me
and
somebody
grabbed
me
in
his
arms
and
lugged
me
into
the
house
i
guess
it
was
attorney
mullen
you
know
how
big
and
husky
he
is
but
i
could
see
him
i
could
see
anything
only
every
two
seconds
bump
he
hit
at
my
head
through
the
blanket
that
how
i
got
this
eye
and
all
the
time
he
was
talking
to
me
mad
as
a
hatter
and
i
could
hear
a
word
he
said
but
i
could
hear
his
wife
screaming
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
i
could
hear
nan
screaming
and
i
heard
a
window
go
up
that
yelling
says
mullen
in
a
voice
i
hear
and
then
he
picked
me
up
again
and
carried
me
to
the
back
door
and
opened
it
and
threw
me
all
the
way
down
the
eight
steps
i
chucked
off
the
blanket
and
i
was
going
up
the
steps
again
to
show
him
he
treat
me
that
way
when
somebody
next
door
took
a
shot
at
me
with
a
revolver
thought
i
was
a
burglar
i
guess
i
started
to
run
for
the
back
gate
when
somebody
shot
at
me
from
the
other
house
what
do
you
think
of
that
for
a
few
minutes
it
sounded
like
the
battle
of
san
juan
and
i
ca
understand
yet
why
i
did
suffer
an
awful
loss
of
life
but
you
did
asked
philo
gubb
no
siree
i
made
a
dive
for
the
cellar
door
just
as
they
got
the
range
i
stayed
in
the
cellarway
with
the
bullets
pattering
on
it
like
hail
until
the
cop
came
tim
fogarty
was
the
cop
he
ordered
firing
and
the
shower
stopped
and
i
let
him
capture
me
he
took
me
to
the
calaboose
and
this
morning
early
he
had
me
before
the
judge
and
i
held
for
the
grand
jury
and
the
charge
is
burglary
and
petit
larceny
now
what
is
the
answer
being
pulled
into
a
house
and
thrown
out
the
other
door
burglary
said
philo
gubb
burglary
is
breaking
in
or
breaking
out
maybe
attorney
mullen
mistook
you
for
some
one
else
mistook
nothing
said
snooks

was
in
the
this
morning
he
handled
the
case
against
me
who
is
that
some
one
was
climbing
the
back
steps
and
snooks
made
one
dive
for
the
cellar
door
and
slipped
inside
he
knew
how
to
get
out
through
the
cellar
for
he
was
familiar
with
it
he
did
not
wait
now
but
opened
the
outside
cellar
door
and
after
looking
to
see
that
the
way
was
clear
hurried
back
to
the
jail
philo
gubb
did
not
have
time
to
descend
from
his
ladder
before
the
kitchen
door
opened
the

was
rightfully
his
and
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
to
earn
it
however
he
must
get
to
work
on
the
case
he
raised
the
pasted
strip
of
paper

on
the
ceiling
some
one
tapped
at

when
miss
turner

said
philo
gubb
a
new
knock
on
the
door
interrupted
them
and
slippery
glided
to
the
cellar
door
through
which
snooks
had
so
recently
fled
the
kitchen
door
opened
to
admit
attorney
smith
he
was
a
thin
man
but
as
thin
men
quite
frequently
are
do
get
down
gubb
do
get
down
he
said
i
came
in
the
back
way
hoping
to
find
miss
turner
she
is
not
here
she
out
said
philo
too
bad
said
attorney
smith
i
wanted
to
see
her
about
her
nephew
you
have
heard
he
is
in
jail
why
yes
said
philo
crossing
one
leg
over
the
other
he
hired
me
to
do
some
deteckating
i
sort
of
in
charge
of
that
case
i
just
going
to
start
in
looking
it
up
attorney
smith
took
a
turn
to
the
end
of
the
room
and
back
he
was
known
in
riverbank
as
the
unsuccessful
competitor
against
attorney
mullen
for
the
city
attorneyship
and
was
supposed
to
be
the
counselor
of
the
liquor
interests
you
have
done
nothing
yet
he
asked
suddenly
stopping
below
philo
gubb
elevated
seat
no
i
just
about
beginning
to
commence
said
philo
then
you
know
nothing
regarding
the
the
articles
young
turner
is
charged
with
stealing
well
maybe
i
do
know
something
about
that
said
philo
if
you
mean
seven
bottles
of
beer
and
a
i
do
where
are
they
asked
attorney
smith
in
the
sharp
tone
he
used
in
addressing
a
witness
for
the
other
side
when
he
was
trying
a
case
i
guess
i
told
about
all
i
going
to
tell
about
them
said
philo
thoughtfully
i
do
want
to
be
disobliging
mister
smith
but
i
look
on
them
bottles
of
beer
as
a
clue
and
that
as
a
clue
and
they
about
the
only
clue
i
got
i
got
to
save
up
my
clues
are
they
in
this
house
asked
smith
sharply
if
they
ai
they
somewheres
else
said
philo
gubb
said
smith
impressively
there
are
large
interests
at
stake
in
this
case
larger
interests
than
you
imagine
we
are
all
interested
at
this
moment
in
clearing
your
client
of
the
suspicion
which
i
hope
is
an
unjust
suspicion
now
resting
over
and
upon
him
i
need
not
say
what
the
interests
are
but
they
are
very
powerful
i
feel
confident
that
those
interests
could
succeed
in
clearing
snooks
turner
well
i
guess
if
i
was
left
alone
long
enough
to
get
down
from
this
ladder
i
could
clear
him
myself
i
did
study
in
the
rising
sun
deteckative
agency
correspondence
school
of
deteckating
for
nothing
said
philo
gubb
snooks
hired
me
and
he
did
well
said
attorney
smith
heartily
i
praise
his
acumen
i
wonder
if
i
might
be
permitted
on
behalf
of
the
powerful
interests
i
represent
to
contribute
to
the
expense
of
the
work
you
will
do
i
guess
you
might
said
philo
gubb
deteckating
runs
into
money
the
interests
i
represent
said
smith
taking
out
his
wallet
will
contribute
ten
dollars
and
they
did
they
put
a
crisp
bill
in
philo
gubb
hands
and
now
having
shown
our
unity
of
interest
with
young
turner
there
can
be
no
harm
in
telling
us
where
that
beer
is
can
there
he
turned
toward
the
kitchen
door
for
nan
kilfillan
stood
there
her
eyes
were
red
and
swollen
attorney
smith
hastily
excused
himself
and
went
away
and
nan
came
into
the
kitchen
oh
mr
gubb
she
exclaimed
you
get
snooks
out
of
jail
wo
you
it
would
break
my
heart
if
he
was
sent
to
the
penitentiary
and
i
he
has
done
nothing
wrong
he
is
depending
on
you
gubb
i
brought
you
ten
dollars
it
is
all
i
have
left
of
last
wages
but
it
will
help
a
little
wo
it
thank
you
said
philo
gubb
taking
the
money
i
can
not
estimate
in
advance
what
the
cost
of
his
clearance
will
be
it
may
be
more
and
it
may
be
less
it
is
a
complicated
case
i
am
just
about
going
to
get
down
from
this
ladder
and
start
working
on
it
vigorously
if
you
he
stopped
if
you
wish
to
help
us
in
this
case
miss
kilfillan
he
said
will
you
go
to
the
jail
and
ask
snooks
where
is
the
beer
and
the
where
is
her
face
went
white
what
beer
and
what
she
asked
tensely
seven
bottles
and
a
said
philo
gubb
oh
she
moaned
and
he
said
he
did
do
it
he
swore
he
did
do
it
oh
snooks
how
could
you
how
could
you
now
do
you
weep
like
that
said
philo
gubb
soothingly
you
go
and
ask
him
i
have
my
things
ready
for
my
immediate
departure
onto
the
case
by
the
time
you
get
back
nan
hurried
away
and
philo
gubb
waited
only
to
count
the
money
he
had
so
far
received
it
amounted
to
dollars
he
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
and
stood
up
on
the
stepladder
he
had
even
proceeded
so
far
as
to
put
one
foot
on
a
lower
step
when
wilmerton
entered
the
kitchen
she
was
a
stout
woman
and
she
was
almost
out
of
breath
she
had
to
stand
a
minute
before
she
could
speak
but
as
she
stood
she
made
gestures
with
her
hands
as
if
much
of
her
delivery
could
be
given
at
any
rate
and
the
words
might
catch
up
with
their
appropriate
gestures
if
they
could
mister
gubb
mister
gubb
she
gasped
oh
this
is
terrible
terrible
miss
turner
should
never
have
dared
it
oh
my
breath
do
you
do
you
know
where
the
beer
is
i
would
advise
you
to
take
beer
for
shortness
of
the
breath
said
philo
gubb
just
rest
a
minute
but
gasped
poor
wilmerton
i
miss
turner
it
was
folly
she
so
stubborn
ah
h
i
thought
i
never
get
a
full
breath
again
as
long
as
i
lived
how
can
we
get
rid
of
the
beer
illustration
she
made
gestures
with
her
hands
there
plenty
want
to
take
it
said
gubb
attorney
smith
oh
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
moaned
wilmerton
he
threatened
it
threatened
what
asked
philo
gubb
that
he
would
find
the
beer
in
this
house
cried
wilmerton
he
threatened
aunt
martha
that
if
she
did
not
give
it
to
him
freely
he
would
have
it
found
here
and
make
a
scandal
beer
hidden
between
the
quilt
and
the
mattress
of
aunt
martha
bed
and
she
secretary
of
the
ladies
temperance
league
it
awful
martha
is
so
headstrong
getting
herself
in
an
awful
fix
she
never
should
have
had
a
thing
to
do
with
that
slippery
fellow
with
who
with
slippery
williams
asked
philo
gubb
intensely
surprised
aunt
martha
turner
what
did
she
have
to
do
with
slippery
williams
well
she
had
plenty
and
enough
and
more
than
that
to
do
with
him
said
wilmerton
angrily
getting
bottles
of
beer
in
her
bed
and
robbing
houses
at
her
time
of
life
and
wanting
the
ladies
temperance
league
to
have
a
special
meeting
this
morning
to
approve
of
burglary
and
larceny
at
her
age
now
miss
wilmerton
said
philo
gubb
from
the
top
of
the
ladder
i
ought
to
warn
you
before
you
go
any
farther
that
snooks
turner
has
engaged
me
and
my
services
to
detect
for
him
in
this
burglar
case
if
aunt
martha
turner
burgled
the
burglary
that
snooks
is
in
jail
for
maybe
you
ought
not
say
anything
about
it
to
me
i
got
to
do
what
i
can
to
free
snooksy
no
matter
who
it
gets
into
trouble
mr
gubb
exclaimed
wilmerton
suddenly
gubb
i
not
authorized
so
to
do
but
i
warrant
i
get
the
other
ladies
to
authorize
or
i
know
why
if
i
was
to
give
you
twenty
dollars
on
behalf
of
the
ladies
temperance
league
to
help
get
snooksy
out
of
jail
and
land
only
knows
why
he
is
in
jail
would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
beg
and
plead
with
snooksy
to
leave
attorney
mullen
alone
in
the
after
this
she
held
four
bills
up
to
philo
gubb
and
he
took
them
from
what
i
saw
of
his
eye
said
gubb
i
guess
snooks
will
be
willing
to
leave
attorney
mullen
alone
in
every
shape
and
form
from
now
on
now
maybe
you
can
tell
me
how
snooks
got
into
this
business
i
have
the
slightest
idea
in
the
world
said
wilmerton
all
i
know
about
it
is
both
wilmerton
and
philo
gubb
turned
their
heads
toward
the
door
the
greater
duskiness
of
the
kitchen
was
caused
by
the
large
form
of
city
attorney
mullen
he
bowed
ceremoniously
to
wilmerton
who
turned
bright
red
with
embarrassment
probably
because
of
her
part
in
the
efforts
of
the
league
to
have
mullen
impeached
by
the
city
council
attorney
mullen
was
not
however
embarrassed
i
am
glad
you
are
here
wilmerton
he
said
for
i
wish
a
witness
i
do
not
wish
to
have
any
stigma
of
bribery
rest
on
me
i
came
here
he
continued
taking
a
leather
purse
from
the
inner
pocket
of
his
coat
to
give
these
dollars
to
gubb
gubb
i
have
just
visited
snooks
so
called
turner
at
the
jail
i
went
there
with
the
intention
of
bailing
him
out
pending
the
simple
process
of
his
ultimate
and
speedy
release
from
the
charges
against
him
i
am
convinced
that
i
was
wrong
when
i
made
the
charge
of
burglary
against
him
i
am
convinced
that
no
burglary
was
ever
committed
on
my
premises
oh
exclaimed
wilmerton
not
even
seven
bottles
of
beer
and
a
i
suppose
attorney
mullen
turned
on
her
like
a
flash
what
do
you
know
about
beer
and
he
snapped
i
may
not
know
as
much
as
detective
gubb
but
i
know
what
i
know
she
answered
and
mullen
restrained
himself
sufficiently
to
hide
the
glare
of
hatred
in
his
eyes
by
turning
to
philo
gubb
exactly
he
said
with
forced
calmness
and
perhaps
i
know
more
about
them
than
gubb
knows
in
fact
i
do
know
more
about
them
i
know
they
are
upstairs
between
a
blanket
and
a
mattress
i
know
wilmerton
he
almost
shouted
turning
on
her
with
an
accusing
forefinger
that
they
were
stolen
from
a
house
in
this
town
by
some
one
representing
the
ladies
temperance
league
i
know
that
burglary
was
committed
by
or
at
the
behest
of
some
one
representing
the
ladies
temperance
league
i
know
that
if
this
matter
is
carried
to
the
end
a
respectable
old
lady
a
leader
in
the
ladies
temperance
league
will
go
behind
the
bars
sentenced
as
a
burglar
that
what
i
know
oh
my
gasped
wilmerton
and
sank
into
a
chair
now
then
said
attorney
mullen
turning
to
philo
gubb
again
and
handing
him
the
dollars
i
give
you
this
money
as
my
share
of
the
fund
that
is
to
pay
you
for
the
work
you
do
for
snooks
turner
i
make
no
request
because
of
the
money
it
is
yours
but
if
you
love
justice
for
heaven
sake
send
word
to
him
to
come
out
of
jail
wo
he
come
out
asked
philo
gubb
puzzled
no
he
wo
said
attorney
mullen
i
begged
him
to
but
he
said
not
until
philo
gubb
gets
to
the
bottom
of
this
case
but
should
we
as
citizens
and
as
members
of
the
prohibition
party
permit
you
gubb
to
land
aunt
martha
turner
in
the
calaboose
well
if
what
i
find
out
when
i
get
down
from
this
ladder
and
start
to
work
sends
her
there
i
do
see
that
i
can
help
it
said
philo
gubb
deteckative
work
is
a
science
as
operated
by
them
that
has
studied
in
the
rising
sun
deteckative
agency
correspondence
school
of
deteckating
snooks
says
he
do
know
anything
about
any
beer
said
nan
kilfillan
entering
hastily
and
then
pausing
as
she
saw
mullen
did
you
tell
him
it
was
upstairs
in
bed
asked
philo
gubb
in
his
room
in
his
bed
said
attorney
mullen
eagerly
why
that
puts
an
entirely
different
aspect
on
the
matter
that
gives
me
as
city
attorney
all
the
proof
i
shall
need
to
convict
the
respectable
miss
martha
turner
and
her
honorable
nephew
of
the
and
by
the
gods
i
convict
them
he
glared
at
wilmerton
nan
broke
into
sobs
unless
he
added
gently
this
whole
matter
is
dropped
philo
gubb
took
out
all
the
money
he
had
received
and
counted
it
sitting
on
the
ladder
i
guess
he
said
thoughtfully
you
had
better
run
up
to
the
jail
and
tell
snooksy
i
want
to
see
him
right
away
miss
kilfillan
maybe
he
can
stretch
the
jail
that
much
again
tell
him
i
just
going
to
get
down
from
this
ladder
and
start
to
work
and
i
want
to
ask
his
advice
what
do
you
want
to
ask
him
inquired
attorney
mullen
as
nan
hurried
away
i
want
to
ask
him
about
those
seven
bottles
of
beer
and
that
said
philo
gubb
gubb
said
the
city
attorney
i
can
tell
you
about
those
bottles
of
beer
if
those
bottles
of
beer
came
from
my
house
aunt
martha
turner
goes
to
the
penitentiary
if
she
does
not
go
to
the
penitentiary
there
are
no
bottles
of
beer
and
there
is
no
and
never
were
i
told
her
she
had
done
a
foolish
foolish
thing
exclaimed
wilmerton
just
so
and
it
foolish
said
attorney
mullen
it
was
done
and
if
it
was
done
and
snooks
turner
telephoned
and
i
thought
he
meant
the
burglary
i
would
naturally
assault
him
you
hurt
him
bad
said
philo
gubb
and
i
meant
to
said
attorney
mullen
all
turned
toward
the
door
where
policeman
fogarty
entered
with
snooksy
and
nan
i
done
ivrything
i
cud
t
quiet
th
matter
up
said
fogarty
to
mullen
thus
explaining
his
interest
in
the
affair
i
like
jail
said
snooks
cheerfully
i
going
to
stay
in
jail
aunt
martha
turner
interrupted
him
she
came
into
the
kitchen
like
a
gust
of
wind
scattering
the
others
like
leaves
and
threw
her
arms
around
her
nephew
snooksy
oh
my
snooksy
my
snooksy
she
moaned
do
you
love
your
old
auntie
any
more
wo
you
be
a
good
boy
for
your
poor
old
auntie
do
you
love
her
at
all
any
more
sure
said
snooks
happily
a
fellow
can
love
you
in
jail
he
but
wo
you
come
out
she
pleaded
everybody
wants
you
to
come
out
dear
dear
boy
see
they
all
want
you
to
come
out
every
last
one
of
them
please
come
out
oh
i
like
it
in
jail
said
snooks
it
gives
me
time
for
meditation
well
folks
i
be
going
back
his
aunt
grasped
him
firmly
by
the
arm
and
wailed
so
did
nan
but
snooksy
begged
turner
do
you
know
they
send
me
to
the
penitentiary
if
you
go
back
to
that
old
jail
yes
but
do
you
care
auntie
they
say
the
penitentiary
is
nicer
than
the
jail
better
doors
nobody
can
break
in
and
steal
things
from
you
snooks
turner
said
his
aunt
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
mullen
will
forgive
and
forget
if
you
will
would
you
rather
see
me
go
to
prison
suffer
no
of
course
not
auntie
said
snooks
laughing
but
you
see
hired
detective
gubb
to
work
on
this
case
and
if
there
no
case
it
will
not
be
fair
to
him
he
all
worked
up
about
it
he
so
eager
to
be
at
it
that
he
has
almost
come
down
from
the
top
of
that
ladder
in
another
day
or
two
he
would
come
all
the
way
down
and
then
no
telling
what
would
happen
no
i
a
newspaper
man
i
want
philo
gubb
to
discover
something
we
do
know
anything
about
i
might
start
in
trailing
and
shadowing
somebody
that
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case
suggested
philo
gubb
that
would
discommode
none
of
you
folks
and
i
sort
of
feel
as
if
i
was
giving
you
your
money
worth
somebody
has
been
writin
on
the
front
of
the
methodist
church
with
black
chalk
i
might
try
to
detect
who
done
that
but
that
would
be
a
very
difficult
job
said
snooks
it
would
be
some
hard
admitted
philo
gubb
then
you
ought
to
have
more
money
said
snooks
aunt
martha
ought
to
contribute
to
the
fund
if
aunt
martha
contributes
to
the
fund
i
be
good
i
come
out
of
jail
aunt
martha
opened
her
shopping
bag
and
fumbled
in
it
with
her
old
fingers
philo
gubb
took
from
his
pocket
the
bills
he
had
been
given
during
the
morning
he
counted
them
he
had
exactly
one
hundred
dollars
just
enough
to
send
to
medderbrook
how
much
should
i
give
you
mr
gubb
asked
aunt
martha
tremulously
and
philo
gubb
stared
thoughtfully
at
the
ceiling
for
a
few
minutes
when
he
spoke
his
words
were
cryptic
to
all
those
in
the
room
well
he
said
i
guess
ten
cents
will
be
about
enough
got
a
postage
stamp
myself
ai
detectives
wonderful
whispered
nan
clinging
to
snooks
arm
you
ca
ever
tell
what
they
really
mean
nobody
seemed
to
care
what
philo
gubb
meant
but
a
week
later
snooks
stopped
him
on
the
street
and
asked
him
why
he
had
asked
for
ten
cents
for
to
register
a
letter
said
philo
gubb
a
letter
i
had
to
send
off
the
chicken
philo
gubb
with
three
rolls
of
under
his
arm
and
a
pail
of
mixed
paste
in
one
hand
walked
along
cherry
street
near
the
on
this
occasion
gubb
was
in
a
reasonably
contented
frame
of
mind
for
he
had
just
received
his
share
of
the
reward
for
capturing
the
dynamiters
and
had
this
very
morning
paid
the
full
amount
to
medderbrook
leaving
but
eleven
thousand
six
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
still
to
be
paid
that
gentleman
for
the
utterly
hopeless
stock
and
upon
the
further
payment
of
cents
half
its
cost
medderbrook
gave
him
a
telegram
he
had
received
from
syrilla
the
telegram
was
as
follows
rapidly
shrinking
have
given
up
all
soups
including
tomato
soup
chicken
soup
mulligatawny
mock
turtle
green
pea
vegetable
gumbo
lentil
consommé
bouillon
and
clam
broth
now
weigh
only
nine
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
wire
at
once
whether
clam
chowder
is
a
soup
or
a
food
fond
remembrances
to
gubby
gubb
was
thinking
of
this
telegram
as
he
walked
toward
his
work
just
ahead
of
him
a
short
lane
led
between
smith
house
and
the
cherry
street
methodist
chapel
to
the
chicken
coop
stood
on
the
fence
line
between
her
property
and
the
illustration
deteckating
is
my
aim
and
my
profession
philo
gubb
had
passed
smith
front
gate
when
smith
waddled
to
her
fence
and
hailed
him
oh
mr
gubb
she
panted
you
got
to
excuse
me
for
speakin
to
you
when
i
do
know
you
miffin
says
you
a
detective
deteckating
is
my
aim
and
my
profession
said
gubb
well
said
smith
i
want
to
ask
a
word
of
you
about
crime
i
had
a
chicken
stole
is
a
crime
if
ever
there
was
one
said
philo
gubb
seriously
what
was
the
chicken
worth
forty
cents
said
smith
well
said
philo
gubb
it
would
hardly
pay
me
it
ai
much
admitted
smith
no
you
right
it
ai
said
philo
gubb
was
this
a
rooster
or
a
hen
it
was
a
hen
said
smith
well
said
gubb
if
you
was
to
offer
a
reward
of
a
hundred
dollars
for
the
capture
of
the
thief
oh
my
land
exclaimed
smith
it
would
be
cheaper
for
me
to
pay
somebody
five
dollars
to
come
and
steal
the
rest
of
the
chickens
it
seems
to
me
that
you
ought
to
make
the
thief
pay
i
ai
the
one
that
did
the
crime
am
i
it
only
right
that
a
thief
should
pay
for
the
time
and
trouble
he
puts
you
to
ai
it
i
never
before
looked
at
it
that
way
said
gubb
thoughtfully
but
it
stands
to
reason
of
course
it
does
said
smith
you
catch
that
thief
and
you
can
offer
yourself
a
million
dollars
reward
if
you
want
to
none
of
my
business
well
said
philo
gubb
picking
up
his
i
guess
if
there
ai
any
important
murders
or
things
turn
up
by
seven
start
in
to
work
for
that
reward
i
guess
i
ca
ask
more
than
five
dollars
reward
at
seven
the
evening
was
still
light
and
philo
gubb
to
cover
his
intentions
and
avert
suspicion
in
case
his
interview
with
smith
had
been
observed
by
the
thief
put
a
false
beard
in
his
pocket
and
a
revolver
beside
it
and
left
his
office
in
the
opera
house
block
cautiously
he
slipped
into
the
alley
and
glided
down
it
keeping
close
to
the
stables
a
detective
must
be
cautious
the
abandoned
offered
admirable
seclusion
a
is
built
entirely
or
almost
so
of
the
brick
that
are
to
be
burned
and
the
kilns
are
torn
down
and
carted
away
as
the
brick
are
sold
the
of
the
kilns
was
a
mere
roof
of
planks
laid
on
timbers
that
were
upheld
by
poles
a
ladder
leaning
against
one
of
the
poles
gave
access
to
the
roof
in
the
darkness
it
was
impossible
for
philo
gubb
to
find
a
of
the
culprit
on
the
kilns
although
he
looked
for
one
he
did
not
even
find
the
usual
and
highly
helpful
button
torn
from
its
place
in
the
criminal
eagerness
to
depart
he
found
only
an
old
horseshoe
and
a
broken
tobacco
pipe
as
there
were
evidences
that
the
pipe
had
been
abandoned
on
that
spot
several
years
earlier
neither
of
these
was
a
very
valuable
clue
gubb
next
gave
his
attention
to
the
chicken
coop
it
was
preëminently
a
chicken
coop
of
the
variety
philo
gubb
entered
the
and
looked
around
lighting
his
dark
lantern
and
throwing
its
rays
here
and
there
that
he
might
see
better
the
house
was
so
low
of
roof
that
he
had
to
stoop
to
avoid
the
roosts
and
the
tails
of
the
chickens
brushed
his
hat
it
needed
brushing
so
this
did
no
harm
the
hens
and
the
two
roosters
complained
gently
of
this
interruption
of
their
beauty
sleep
and
moved
along
the
roosts
and
gubb
went
outside
again
it
was
quite
evident
that
the
thief
had
had
no
great
hardships
to
undergo
in
robbing
that
roost
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
enter
the
choose
a
chicken
and
walk
away
with
it
why
had
he
not
taken
ten
chickens
gubb
as
he
put
the
keg
hoop
over
the
end
board
of
the
gate
studied
this
the
theory
that
gubb
adopted
was
that
the
thief
coming
for
a
raid
on
the
coop
had
been
surprised
to
find
it
so
poorly
guarded
it
had
been
so
easy
to
enter
the
coop
and
steal
the
chicken
that
he
had
decided
it
would
be
folly
to
take
eight
or
ten
chickens
and
thus
arouse
instant
suspicion
and
reprisal
instead
of
this
he
had
taken
but
one
trusting
that
the
loss
of
one
would
be
unnoticed
or
laid
to
rats
or
cats
or
weasels
thus
he
would
be
able
to
return
again
and
again
as
fowl
meat
was
needed
or
desired
and
the
chickens
would
be
like
money
in
the
bank
a
fund
on
which
to
draw
this
theory
was
so
sound
that
gubb
believed
it
would
require
nothing
more
than
patience
to
capture
the
criminal
the
thief
would
come
back
for
more
chickens
philo
gubb
looked
around
for
an
advantageous
position
in
which
to
await
the
coming
of
the
thief
and
be
unseen
himself
and
the
loose
board
roof
of
the
met
his
eye
no
position
could
be
better
he
climbed
the
ladder
inside
the
kiln
pushed
one
of
the
boards
aside
enough
to
permit
him
to
squeeze
through
onto
the
roof
and
creeping
carefully
over
the
loose
boards
reached
the
edge
of
the
roof
here
he
stretched
himself
out
flat
on
the
boards
and
waited
nothing
absolutely
nothing
happened
the
mosquitoes
numerous
indeed
because
of
the
nearness
of
the
pond
buzzed
around
his
head
and
stung
him
on
the
neck
and
hands
but
he
did
not
dare
slap
at
them
lest
he
betray
his
hour
followed
hour
and
no
chicken
thief
appeared
and
when
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
lighted
the
east
he
climbed
down
and
stalked
stiffly
away
to
a
short
hour
of
sleep
the
next
night
the
correspondence
school
detective
wasted
no
time
in
preliminary
observations
of
the
lay
of
the
land
he
kept
out
of
sight
until
the
sun
had
set
and
dusk
covered
the
land
with
shade
and
then
he
went
at
once
to
the
roof
of
the
this
time
he
was
disguised
in
a
red
mustache
a
pair
of
flowing
white
and
a
woolen
cap
and
he
wore
two
revolvers
large
ones
in
a
belt
about
his
waist
it
was
still
too
early
for
brisk
business
in
when
philo
gubb
climbed
to
the
roof
of
the
kiln
and
spread
himself
out
there
and
he
felt
that
he
had
time
for
a
few
minutes
sleep
he
was
tremendously
sleepy
sleep
fairly
pushed
his
eyelids
down
over
his
eyes
and
he
put
his
crooked
arm
under
his
head
and
after
thinking
fondly
of
syrilla
for
a
few
minutes
went
to
sleep
so
suddenly
that
it
was
like
falling
off
a
cliff
into
dreamland
he
dreamed
uneasily
of
having
been
captured
by
an
array
of
forty
chicken
thieves
of
having
been
led
in
triumph
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
and
of
having
been
condemned
as
a
detective
trust
on
the
charge
of
acting
in
restraint
of
trade
as
injuring
the
chicken
stealers
association
business
and
required
to
dissolve
himself
the
dream
was
agonizing
as
he
tried
one
dissolvent
after
another
without
success
turpentine
merely
dissolved
his
skin
alcohol
had
no
effect
whatever
he
imagined
himself
in
a
long
room
in
which
stood
vast
rows
of
vats
bearing
different
labels
and
in
and
out
of
these
he
climbed
trying
to
obey
the
order
of
the
court
but
nothing
seemed
capable
of
dissolving
him
and
he
suddenly
discovered
that
he
was
made
of
rubber
he
seemed
to
remember
that
rubber
was
soluble
in
benzine
and
he
started
on
a
tour
of
the
vats
trying
to
find
a
benzine
vat
he
walked
many
miles
sometimes
he
arose
in
the
air
with
ease
and
grace
and
flew
a
few
miles
finally
he
found
the
vat
of
benzine
immersed
himself
in
it
and
began
to
dissolve
calmly
and
with
a
blessed
sense
of
having
done
his
duty
it
was
then
that
philo
gubb
entered
the
dreamless
sleep
of
the
utterly
weary
and
about
the
same
time
two
men
slunk
under
the
roof
of
the
and
after
looking
carefully
around
took
seats
on
the
fallen
bricks
resting
their
backs
against
the
partly
demolished
kiln
they
arranged
the
bricks
as
comfortably
as
possible
before
seating
themselves
and
when
they
were
seated
one
of
them
drew
a
whiskey
bottle
from
his
pocket
and
after
taking
a
good
swig
offered
it
to
his
partner
nope
said
he
i
going
to
steer
clear
of
that
stuff
until

know
where

harmless
thing

of
fellers
tell
how
mother
smith
keeps
tabs
on
anybody
that

of
ten
cents
even
why
maybe
the
chicken

night
and

wixy
drunkenly
you

all
right
said
sandlot
rising
i
see
ghosts
then
but
see
them
by
myself

can
go
said
wixy
carelessly
and
finished
the
last
drop
in
his
bottle
ol
sandlot
sandlot
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
arose
and
after
a
parting
glance
at
wixy
struck
out
across
the
drying
floor
of
the
and
was
lost
in
the
darkness
wixy
blinked
and
balanced
the
empty
bottle
in
his
hand
he
afraid
he
boasted
to
himself
he
coward
of
dark
of
ghosts
los
his
nerve
i
ain
he
arose
to
his
feet
unsteadily
sandlot
coward
he
said
and
threw
down
the
empty
bottle
with
a
motion
of
disgust
at
the
cowardice
of
sandlot
the
bottle
burst
with
a
jangling
of
glass
on
the
loose
board
roof
philo
gubb
raised
his
head
suddenly
for
an
instant
he
imagined
he
was
a
disembodied
spirit
his
body
having
been
dissolved
in
benzine
but
as
he
became
wider
awake
he
was
conscious
of
a
noise
beneath
him
wixy
was
shifting
twenty
or
thirty
bricks
that
had
fallen
from
the
kiln
upon
a
truss
of
straw
used
the
last
winter
to
cover
bricks
to
protect
them
from
the
frost
against
their
drying
he
was
preparing
a
bed
he
muttered
to
himself
as
he
worked
and
philo
gubb
placing
his
eye
to
a
crack
between
the
boards
of
the
roof
tried
to
observe
him
the
darkness
was
so
absolute
he
could
see
nothing
whatever
he
heard
wixy
stretch
out
on
the
straw
and
in
a
minute
more
he
heard
the
heavy
breathing
of
a
sleeper
wixy
was
not
letting
any
cowardice
disturb
his
repose
at
all
events
and
philo
gubb
considered
how
he
could
best
get
himself
off
the
roof
the
sleeping
man
was
immediately
beneath
him
the
ladder
was
a
full
ten
yards
away
every
motion
made
the
loose
boards
complain
looking
down
gubb
saw
that
the
top
of
the
kiln
reached
within
a
few
feet
of
where
he
lay
and
that
the
partially
removed
sides
had
left
a
series
of
giant
steps
gubb
loosened
his
pistols
in
his
belt
now
that
he
had
the
chicken
thief
so
near
he
meant
to
capture
him
with
the
utmost
care
he
slid
one
of
the
boards
of
the
roof
aside
and
put
his
long
legs
into
the
opening
thus
made
feeling
for
the
kiln
until
he
touched
it
and
when
he
had
a
firm
footing
on
it
he
lowered
the
upper
part
of
his
body
through
the
roof
five
feet
away
a
reached
from
one
pillar
of
the
roof
to
another
and
just
below
that
was
one
of
the
steps
of
the
kiln
philo
gubb
lighted
his
dark
lantern
and
casting
its
ray
saw
this
if
he
could
jump
and
reach
it
he
could
drop
to
the
lower
step
and
avoid
the
danger
of
bringing
the
side
of
the
kiln
down
with
him
he
slipped
the
lantern
into
his
pocket
reached
out
his
hands
and
jumped
into
the
dark
for
an
instant
his
fingers
grappled
with
the
he
struggled
to
gain
a
firmer
hold
and
then
he
dropped
straight
upon
the
sleeping
wixy
he
alighted
fair
and
square
on
the
murderer
stomach
and
the
air
went
out
of
wixy
in
a
sudden
philo
gubb
in
the
unreasoning
excitement
of
the
moment
grappled
with
wixy
but
the
unresistance
of
the
man
told
that
he
was
unconscious
and
the
correspondence
school
detective
released
him
and
stood
up
he
uncovered
the
lens
of
his
dark
lantern
and
turned
the
ray
on
wixy
the
murderer
lay
flat
on
his
back
his
eyes
closed
and
his
mouth
open
gubb
put
his
hand
on
wixy
heart
it
still
beat
the
man
was
not
dead
illustration
with
another
groan
wixy
raised
his
hands
with
the
dark
lantern
in
one
hand
and
a
rusty
tin
can
in
the
other
gubb
hurried
to
the
pond
and
returned
with
the
can
full
of
water
but
even
in
this
crisis
he
did
not
act
thoughtlessly
he
set
the
dark
lantern
on
a
shelf
of
the
kiln
so
that
its
rays
might
illuminate
wixy
and
himself
alike
drew
one
of
his
pistols
and
pointed
it
full
at
wixy
head
and
holding
it
so
he
dashed
the
can
of
water
in
the
face
of
the
unconscious
man
wixy
moved
uneasily
he
emitted
a
long
sigh
and
opened
his
eyes
i
got
you
said
philo
gubb
sternly
there
ai
no
use
to
make
a
move
because
i
a
deteckative
and
if
you
do
i
shoot
this
pistol
at
you
if
you
able
so
to
do
just
put
up
your
hands
wixy
blinked
in
the
strong
light
of
the
lantern
he
groaned
and
placed
one
of
his
hands
on
his
stomach
put
up
said
philo
gubb
and
with
another
groan
wixy
raised
his
hands
he
was
still
flat
on
his
back
he
looked
as
if
he
were
doing
some
sort
of
health
exercise
in
a
minute
the
hands
fell
to
the
ground
i
guess
you
better
set
up
said
philo
gubb
you
ai
goin
to
be
able
to
hold
up
your
hands
if
you
lay
down
that
way
as
he
helped
wixy
to
a
sitting
position
he
kept
his
pistol
against
the
fellow
head
now
then
said
philo
gubb
when
he
had
arranged
his
captive
to
suit
his
taste
what
you
got
to
say
i
got
to
say
i
never
done
what
you
think
i
done
whatever
it
is
said
wixy
i
do
know
what
it
is
but
i
never
done
it
some
other
feller
done
it
that
do
bother
me
none
said
philo
gubb
if
you
did
do
it
i
do
know
who
did
just
about
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
account
for
the
chicken
and
pay
my
expenses
of
getting
you
and
the
quicker
you
do
it
the
better
off
you
be
pale
as
wixy
was
he
turned
still
paler
when
philo
gubb
mentioned
the
chicken
i
never
killed
the
chicken
he
almost
shouted
i
never
did
it
i
do
care
whether
you
killed
the
chicken
or
not
said
philo
gubb
calmly
the
chicken
is
gone
and
i
reckon
that
the
end
of
the
chicken
but
smith
has
got
to
be
paid
did
she
send
you
asked
wixy
trembling
did
mother
smith
put
you
onto
me
she
did
so
said
the
correspondence
school
detective
and
you
can
pay
up
or
go
to
jail
how
you
like
that
wixy
studied
the
tall
detective
look
here
he
said
i
give
you
fifty
and
we
call
it
square
he
meant
fifty
dollars
maybe
that
would
satisfy
smith
said
philo
gubb
thinking
of
fifty
cents
but
it
do
satisfy
me
my
time
valuable
and
it
got
to
be
paid
for
ten
times
fifty
ai
a
bit
too
much
and
if
it
had
took
longer
to
catch
you
i
have
asked
more
if
you
want
to
give
that
much
all
right
and
if
you
do
all
right
too
wixy
studied
the
face
of
philo
gubb
carefully
there
was
no
sign
of
mercy
in
the
face
of
the
detective
indeed
his
face
was
severe
it
was
relentless
in
its
sternness
five
dollars
was
little
enough
to
ask
for
two
nights
of
correspondence
school
detective
work
rather
than
take
less
he
would
lead
the
chicken
thief
to
jail
and
wixy
with
his
third
and
half
of
the
third
of
the
proceeds
of
the
criminal
job
that
had
led
to
the
death
of
the
chicken
knowing
the
relentlessness
of
mother
smith
that
female
fagin
of
chicago
considered
that
he
would
be
doing
well
to
purchase
his
freedom
for
five
hundred
dollars
all
right
pal
he
said
suddenly
you
on
it
a
bet
here
you
are
he
slipped
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
drew
out
a
great
roll
of
money
with
the
muzzle
of
philo
gubb
pistol
hovering
just
out
of
reach
before
him
he
counted
out
five
crisp
one
hundred
dollar
bills
he
held
them
out
with
a
sickly
grin
philo
gubb
took
them
and
looked
at
them
puzzled
what
this
for
he
asked
and
wixy
suddenly
blazed
forth
in
anger
now
do
come
any
of
that
he
cried
a
bargain
is
a
bargain
do
you
come
you
did
say
you
take
five
hundred
and
try
to
get
more
out
of
me
i
wo
give
you
no
more
i
wo
you
can
jug
me
if
you
want
to
you
ca
prove
nothin
on
me
and
you
know
it
have
you
found
the
body
of
the
chicken
well
you
got
to
have
the
corpus
ai
you
huh
ai
five
hundred
enough
i
bet
the
chicken
never
cost
mother
smith
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
i
was
only
thinkin
began
philo
gubb
do
think
then
said
wixy
five
hundred
dollars
seemed
too
philo
began
again
it
all
you
get
if
i
hang
for
it
said
wixy
firmly
you
can
give
mother
smith
what
you
want
and
keep
what
you
want
that
all
you
get
philo
gubb
could
not
understand
it
he
tried
to
but
he
could
not
understand
it
at
all
and
then
suddenly
a
great
light
dawned
in
his
brain
there
was
something
this
chicken
thief
knew
that
he
and
smith
did
not
know
the
stolen
chicken
must
have
been
of
some
rare
and
strain
so
it
was
all
right
the
thief
was
paying
what
the
chicken
was
worth
and
not
what
smith
thought
it
was
worth
in
her
ignorance
he
slipped
the
money
into
his
pocket
all
right
he
said
i
satisfied
if
you
are
the
chicken
was
a
fancy
bird
ai
it
so
the
chicken
was
a
tough
old
rooster
that
what
he
was
said
wixy
staggering
to
his
feet
i
thought
he
was
a
hen
said
philo
gubb
smith
said
he
was
a
hen
wixy
laughed
a
sickly
laugh
that
ai
much
of
a
joke
that
why
everybody
called
him
chicken
because
his
first
name
was
hen
philo
gubb
mouth
fell
open
he
was
convinced
now
that
he
had
to
do
with
an
insane
man
wixy
moved
toward
the
open
well
so
pard
he
said
to
philo
gubb
give
my
regards
to
mother
smith
and
say
he
added
if
you
see
sal
do
let
her
know
what
happened
to
the
chicken
do
say
anybody
made
away
with
the
chicken
see
tell
sal
the
chicken
flew
the
coop
himself
see
who
is
sal
asked
philo
gubb
you
ask
mother
smith
said
wixy
she
tell
you
and
he
went
out
into
the
dark
philo
gubb
heard
him
shuffle
across
the
and
when
the
sound
had
died
away
in
the
distance
he
put
up
his
revolver
five
hundred
dollars
he
said
and
he
routed
smith
out
of
bed
he
did
not
tell
her
the
amount
of
reward
he
had
made
the
chicken
thief
pay
he
asked
her
what
the
most
expensive
chicken
in
the
world
might
be
worth
and
she
reluctantly
accepted
ten
dollars
as
being
far
too
much
then
he
asked
her
who
sal
was
sal
queried
smith
the
chicken
thief
declared
the
statement
that
you
would
know
said
gubb
he
said
to
tell
her
well
gubb
said
smith
tartly
i
do
know
any
sal
and
if
i
did
i
would
carry
messages
to
her
for
a
chicken
thief
and
it
is
past
midnight
and
the
draught
on
my
bare
feet
is
giving
me
my
death
of
cold
and
if
you
think
this
is
a
pink
tea
for
me
to
stand
around
and
hold
fool
conversation
at
i
do
and
she
slammed
the
door
the
dragon
eye
it
was
with
great
pleasure
that
gubb
carried
four
hundred
and
ninety
dollars
to
medderbrook
and
his
intended
received
him
quite
graciously
this
is
more
like
it
gubb
he
said
keep
the
money
coming
right
along
and
you
find
i
a
good
friend
and
a
faithful
one
i
aim
so
to
do
to
the
best
of
my
ability
said
gubb
delighted
to
find
medderbrook
in
a
good
humor
i
hope
to
get
the
eleven
thousand
two
hundred
and
sixty
dollars
i
owe
you
paid
up
where
do
you
get
that
asked
medderbrook
you
owe
me
twelve
thousand
dollars
gubb
it
was
eleven
thousand
seven
hundred
and
fifty
said
gubb
and
this
here
payment
of
four
hundred
and
ninety
ah
said
medderbrook
but
the
utterly
hopeless
has
declared
a
dividend
but
ventured
gubb
timidly
i
thought
dividends
was
money
that
came
to
the
owner
of
the
stock
often
so
said
medderbrook
i
may
say
not
infrequently
so
but
in
this
case
it
was
a
compound
ten
per
cent
reversible
dividend
cumulative
and
retroactive
payable
to
prior
owners
of
the
stock
on
account
of
the
second
mortgage
debenture
lien
in
such
a
case
he
explained
unless
the
priority
is
waived
by
the
party
of
the
first
part
you
have
to
pay
it
to
me
oh
said
gubb
luckily
said
medderbrook
i
was
able
to
prevail
upon
the
registrar
of
the
company
to
make
the
dividend
only
ten
cumulative
per
cents
instead
of
eleven
retroactive
geometrical
per
cents
or
you
would
now
owe
me
thirteen
thousand
dollars
well
i
sure
i
much
obliged
to
you
said
gubb
with
sincere
gratitude
i
appreciate
your
kindness
of
most
greatly
he
stood
for
a
minute
or
two
uneasily
while
medderbrook
frowned
like
a
great
financier
burdened
with
cares
i
do
suppose
said
gubb
when
he
had
screwed
up
his
courage
you
have
had
no
telegraphic
communications
from
miss
syrilla
why
yes
i
have
said
medderbrook
taking
a
telegram
from
his
pocket
and
it
will
only
cost
you
one
dollar
to
read
it
i
paid
two
dollars
gubb
was
very
glad
to
pay
the
small
sum
and
he
eagerly
devoured
the
telegram
which
read
oh
be
joyful
have
given
up
all
meat
diet
have
given
up
beef
pork
lamb
mutton
veal
chicken
pigs
feet
bacon
hash
corned
beef
venison
bear
steak
frogs
legs
opossum
and
fried
snails
weigh
only
nine
hundred
and
forty
pounds
affectionate
thoughts
to
little
gubby
i
wish
said
gubb
wistfully
when
he
had
read
the
message
that
miss
syrilla
could
be
here
present
this
week
in
riverbank
whilst
the
carnival
is
going
on
she
would
draw
a
big
crowd
at
cents
admission
said
medderbrook
i
was
thinking
how
pleasantly
nice
it
would
be
for
her
to
enjoy
the
festivities
of
the
occasion
said
gubb
but
this
was
not
quite
true
what
he
wished
was
that
she
could
be
present
to
see
him
in
the
handsome
disguise
he
had
obtained
for
his
work
as
official
detective
of
the
carnival
and
which
he
was
now
about
to
don
this
the
second
day
of
the
third
riverbank
carnival
opened
with
a
sun
hot
enough
to
frizzle
bacon
and
the
ladies
in
charge
of
the
lemonade
and
cone
booths
were
pleased
while
the
committee
from
riverbank
lodge
no
selling
broiled
frankfurters
known
as
hot
dogs
groaned
it
was
no
day
for
hot
food
but
it
was
grand
carnival
weather
the
grounds
opened
at
and
the
amateur
circus
began
at
but
philo
gubb
the
detective
was
on
the
grounds
in
full
regalia
by
ten
in
the
morning
through
some
awful
error
on
the
part
of
the
chicago
costumer
philo
gubb
regalia
had
not
arrived
in
time
for
the
first
day
of
the
carnival
so
he
had
absented
himself
rather
than
let
the
crooks
and
thieves
who
were
supposed
to
swarm
the
grounds
have
an
opportunity
to
become
acquainted
with
his
appearance
and
thus
be
put
on
their
guard
against
the
famous
correspondence
school
detective
when
the
committee
on
organization
of
the
third
carnival
and
circus
for
the
benefit
of
the
riverbank
free
hospital
held
its
first
public
mass
meeting
in
willcox
hall
philo
gubb
had
been
there
like
all
the
rest
of
riverbank
he
was
willing
to
assist
the
good
cause
in
any
way
he
could
and
he
had
meant
to
donate
his
services
as
official
but
a
grander
opportunity
offered
beech
the
chairman
of
the
committee
on
peanuts
and
police
protection
offered
gubb
the
position
of
official
detective
gubb
accepted
eagerly
during
the
weeks
of
preparation
for
the
carnival
a
thousand
plans
for
getting
the
better
of
pickpockets
and
other
crooks
passed
through
philo
gubb
mind
he
finally
decided
to
disguise
himself
as
ali
baba
he
had
a
slight
recollection
that
ali
baba
had
something
to
do
with
forty
thieves
it
seemed
an
appropriate
his
disguise
he
ordered
from
the
supply
department
of
the
rising
sun
detective
agency
where
he
bought
all
his
disguises
it
consisted
of
a
tall
conical
cap
spangled
with
stars
a
sort
of
red
gown
bespattered
with
black
crescents
a
small
metal
tube
and
a
wand
with
the
metal
tube
came
several
hundred
sheets
of
apparently
blank
paper
but
when
these
were
rolled
into
cylinders
and
inserted
in
the
metal
tube
for
half
a
minute
characters
appeared
on
the
sheets
a
child
could
work
the
magic
tube
and
so
could
philo
gubb
it
was
not
until
the
second
day
that
beech
thought
of
gubb
at
all
then
phillipetti
of
general
phillipetti
who
was
ambassador
to
siberia
in
asked
for
gubb
phillipetti
was
in
charge
of
the
hot
waffles
booth
no
aided
by
seventeen
ladies
of
the
highest
society
riverbank
could
boast
and
they
served
hot
waffles
with
their
own
fair
hands
to
all
who
chose
to
buy
the
cooking
of
the
waffles
being
a
warm
task
in
late
june
had
been
turned
over
to
three
colored
women
hired
for
the
occasion
and
to
complete
the
ongsomble
and
make
things
perfectly
apropos
two
of
phillipetti
favorite
words
the
three
colored
women
had
been
dressed
as
turkish
slaves
while
phillipetti
and
her
aides
dressed
as
beauties
of
the
harem
to
judge
by
phillipetti
costume
the
beauties
of
the
harem
were
expensive
to
clothe
she
had
more
silk
gold
lace
and
tinsel
strung
upon
her
ample
form
than
would
set
a
theatrical
costumer
up
in
business
but
the
star
feature
of
her
costume
was
her
turban
it
was
a
gorgeous
creation
and
would
have
been
a
comfortable
piece
of
headgear
in
midwinter
although
slightly
heating
for
a
hot
june
day
but
it
came
near
being
the
talk
of
the
carnival
for
in
the
center
of
the
front
just
above
her
forehead
phillipetti
had
pinned
the
celebrated
brooch
containing
the
dragon
eye
the
priceless
ruby
given
to
old
general
phillipetti
by
the
dugosh
of
zind
after
the
old
diplomat
had
saved
the
worthless
life
of
the
old
reprobate
by
appealing
to
the
of
siberia
in
his
behalf
the
dragon
eye
was
about
the
size
of
a
lemon
and
weighed
nearly
as
much
as
a
pound
of
creamery
butter
so
it
required
considerable
turban
to
make
it
apropos
and
complete
its
ongsomble
pinned
on
her
chest
phillipetti
wore
a
small
mirror
somewhat
smaller
than
a
tea
saucer
by
tipping
the
outer
edge
of
the
mirror
upward
and
glancing
down
into
it
phillipetti
had
a
good
view
of
the
entire
façade
of
her
turban
reflected
in
the
mirror
and
she
was
thus
able
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
dragon
eye
oh
mr
beech
cried
phillipetti
stopping
him
as
he
was
bustling
past
her
booth
you
know
where
gubb
is
gubb
gubb
said
beech
oh
that
fellow
no
i
do
know
where
he
is
why
it
gone
the
dragon
eye
is
gone
moaned
phillipetti
beech
although
greatly
concerned
tried
to
maintain
his
composure
phillipetti
explained
that
she
had
removed
her
turban
and
placed
it
under
a
chair
at
the
back
of
the
booth
a
little
later
she
had
noticed
that
the
turban
with
the
priceless
dragon
eye
was
gone
now
this
now
was
not
wholly
unexpected
beech
said
a
now
unfortunate
thing
but
it
the
sort
of
thing
that
happens
now
phillipetti
just
let
me
beg
you
not
to
say
anything
about
it
to
anybody
and
i
have
detective
gubb
get
right
on
the
case
the
matter
is
in
my
hands
rest
easy
we
will
attend
to
it
i
i
hate
to
lose
the
dragon
eye
said
phillipetti
wiping
her
eyes
but
the
worst
is
to
have
my
turban
stolen
beech
i
will
give
one
hundred
dollars
to
whoever
returns
the
dragon
eye
to
me
the
of
my
costume
is
ruined
i
have
anything
else
to
wear
on
my
head
you
look
fine
just
as
you
are
said
beech
but
if
you
want
something
to
wear
you
can
get
a
turkish
hat
at
the
paper
hat
booth
for
cents
thank
you
said
phillipetti
scornfully
i
do
wear
hats
within
twenty
minutes
the
boy
scouts
who
were
acting
as
aides
to
the
executive
committee
had
tacked
in
ten
prominent
places
ten
hastily
daubed
placards
that
read
philo
gubb
please
report
at
executive
booth
beech
chmn
police
committee
and
the
members
of
the
board
of
managers
had
singly
and
by
roundabout
routes
approached
the
scene
of
the
theft
and
had
studied
it
illustration
the
of
my
costume
is
ruined
to
the
left
of
phillipetti
booth
was
the
ethiopian
dip
here
some
thirty
feet
back
from
a
counter
and
shielded
by
a
net
a
negro
sat
on
an
elevated
perch
just
over
a
canvas
tub
full
of
water
in
front
of
the
net
was
a
small
target
and
if
a
patron
of
the
game
hit
the
target
with
a
baseball
the
negro
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
dropped
into
the
tub
of
water
the
price
was
three
throws
for
five
cents
as
riverbank
had
some
remarkably
clever
baseball
throwers
the
ethiopian
was
dipped
quite
frequently
as
the
water
was
cold
and
such
a
bath
an
unusual
luxury
for
the
riverbank
ethiopians
no
one
ethiopian
cared
to
be
dipped
very
often
in
succession
therefore
the
committee
of
seven
of
the
exempt
firemen
association
which
had
the
dip
in
charge
had
arranged
for
a
quick
change
of
ethiopians
and
while
one
sat
on
the
perch
to
be
dipped
three
others
lolled
in
bathing
costumes
just
back
of
phillipetti
booth

questioned
the
colored

beech
went
away
the
detective
business
was
not
his
business
he
specialized
in
coal
and
not
in
crime
but
in
going
he
passed
by
phillipetti
booth
and
spoke
to
her
it
will
be
all
right
he
said
reassuringly
we
are
on
the
track
oh
thank
you
said
phillipetti
who
had
completed
the
apropriety
of
her
ongsomble
by
wrapping
a
green
silk
handkerchief
about
her
head
i
hope
to
return
the
turban
and
the
jewel
sometime
said
beech
bluffing
bravely
but
philo
gubb
did
not
heed
the
notices
posted
to
call
him
to
the
executive
booth
the
evening
passed
and
he
did
not
appear
and
beech
on
his
way
home
stopped
at
the
police
station
it
was
after
midnight
but
chief
of
police
wittaker
was
still
on
duty
he
never
slept
during
the
carnival
beech
explained
the
loss
of
the
turban
and
the
dragon
eye
and
early
the
next
morning
the
chief
himself
took
up
the
hunt
by
three
in
the
afternoon
he
had
discovered
several
things
he
discovered
that
the
yellow
man
who
had
claimed
to
see
the
board
pushed
out
from
the
inside
was
the
husband
of
one
of
the
waffle
cooks
in
phillipetti
booth
he
learned
that
the
yellow
man
had
been
in
jail
he
learned
that
for
a
few
minutes
the
yellow
negro
had
been
alone
behind
the
waffle
booth
the
chief
thereupon
arrested
the
yellow
negro
as
he
led
the
negro
from
the
grounds
by
the
back
way
in
order
to
cause
as
little
commotion
as
possible
he
brushed
by
a
strange
creature
dressed
as
a
wizard
who
was
standing
by
the
rear
entrance
droning
tell
your
fortune
ten
cents
tell
your
fortune
ten
cents
the
wizard
was
tall
and
thin
and
wore
a
long
white
beard
a
sort
of
gown
and
a
pointed
cap
as
the
chief
passed
with
his
prisoner
the
wizard
turned
his
eyes
on
the
two
and
then
droned
on
it
was
philo
gubb
the
detective
on
the
job
philo
gubb
having
received
his
costume
had
come
to
the
carnival
grounds
the
back
way
he
had
wandered
about
the
grounds
peeking
and
peering
seeking
malefactors
unsuccessfully
he
felt
the
whole
weight
of
the
carnival
on
his
shoulders
when
he
suspected
a
youth
he
followed
him
at
a
safe
distance
stopping
when
he
stopped
going
on
when
he
went
on
he
was
so
intent
on
trailing
and
shadowing
that
he
did
not
even
notice
the
placards
calling
him
to
the
executive
booth
every
few
minutes
he
had
to
stop
and
tell
a
fortune
with
the
magic
tube
so
far
he
had
collected
two
dollars
and
sixty
cents
the
chief
with
his
prisoner
walking
quietly
by
his
side
to
avoid
unpleasant
commotion
in
an
otherwise
orderly
crowd
had
just
passed
the
wizard
when
he
heard
voices
that
made
him
look
back
there
he
is
said
one
voice
kick
him
off
the
grounds
here
you
said
another
voice
you
got
to
get
out
of
here
and
you
got
to
give
up
the
money
you
taken
quick
now
we
allow
any
professionals
on
these
grounds
the
voices
were
those
of
henry
cross
officer
of
the
day
for
this
day
of
the
carnival
and
sam
green
of
police
and
they
were
speaking
to
the
wizard
sh
said
the
wizard
in
a
mysterious
voice
it
all
right
make
a
fuss
it
all
right
let
me
kick
him
off
the
grounds
said
cross
all
i
want
is
a
chance
to
kick
him
off
the
grounds
the
cheap
professional
fakir
sneaking
in
to
get
money
that
ought
to
go
to
the
hospital
let
me
kick
now
wait
said
green
irritably
we
want
to
make
him
disgorge
first
do
we
just
keep
your
head
on
cross
let
me
handle
this
it
all
right
do
make
a
fuss
whispered
the
wizard
i
belong
here
you
belong
nowhere
shouted
cross
you
belong
here
indeed
why
you
could
tell
that
to
a
baby
i
guess
not
telling

and
putting
the
cash

your
pocket

the
ladies
aid
of
the
second
baptist
church

the
exclusive
privilege

the
chief

back

chicago
grafter

make

said
the
chief
if

tries
to

i
club
him
cross
and
green
hurried
away
and
the
chief
dangled
his
club
meaningly
the
yellow
man
who
had
been
standing
awaiting
the
end
of
the
controversy
seated
himself
on
the
grass
and
leaned
his
back
against
a
tree
philo
gubb
as
evidence
that
he
did
not
mean
to
run
also
seated
himself
and
leaned
back
against
the
same
tree
the
chief
stood
a
short
distance
away
his
eyes
keenly
on
them
how
about
it
chicago
man
asked
the
yellow
man
in
a
low
tone
bending
down
to

blade
of

the
yellow

and
his
hand
slid

eye
into
the
hand
of
philo
gubb
the
chief
moved
nearer
i
guess
dey

in
a
louder
voice
kaze

they
let

said
the
chief
meaningly
and
if
we
can
prove
it
on
you
you
go
to
the
pen
cross
and
green
returned
with
beech
there
he
is
said
cross
pointing
to
the
wizard
gubb
never
saw
him
in
my
life
said
beech
now
then
what
is
this
now
what
this
story
you
the
detective
arose
and
leaned
close
to
beech
ear
he
whispered
three
words
and
beech
attitude
changed
entirely
oh
he
said
i
wondered
where
now
all
right
it
all
right
it
all
right
cross
all
right
green
all
right
chief
then
he
turned
to
gubb
we
been
wanting
you
detective
put
up
placards
for
you
now
listen
phillipetti
had
a
turban
stolen
from
her
booth
and
that
infernal
ton
and
a
half
or
so
of
ruby
was
in
it
the
dragon
eye
she
calls
it
well
that
turban
was
stolen
i
am
quite
well
acquainted
with
that
fact
said
philo
gubb
well
why
do
you
hunt
for
it
then
asked
beech
crossly
i
thought
you
were
going
to
be
of
some
use
fooling
around
here
with
your
silly
having
the
time
of
your
life
while
all
of
us
are
worrying
about
that
dragon
eye
why
do
you
hunt
for
it
it
ai
hardly
necessary
to
engage
in
deteckative
exertions
at
the
present
moment
on
account
of
that
ruby
said
philo
gubb
slowly
because
when
i
want
it
all
i
got
to
do
is
to
consult
the
magic
deteckative
tube
you
crazy
said
beech
you
crazy
as
a
loon
the
usual
price
for
consulting
the
oracle
is
ten
cents
said
philo
gubb
but
i
make
a
special
exception
out
of
this
time
he
put
the
end
of
the
magic
tube
to
his
ear
and
listened
the
genyi
of
the
tube
says
i
got
the
dragon
eye
into
my
pocket
and
if
you
ask
this
yellow
negro
he
tell
you
where
the
turban
is
at
honest
exclaimed
beech
gubb
you
a
wonder
the
negro
thus
trapped
told
where
he
had
hidden
the
turban
and
in
a
few
minutes
beech
cross
and
green
returned
with
phillipetti
on
whose
head
again
towered
the
turban
with
the
eye
gleaming
in
it
making
her
ongsomble
thoroughly
apropos
gubb
said
beech
i
want
phillipetti
to
meet
you
you
certainly
are
a
wizard
yes
indeed
said
phillipetti
the
wizardry
of
your
whole
ongsomble
is
completely
apropos
to
your
detective
ability
the
progressive
murder
when
philo
gubb
paid
medderbrook
the
one
hundred
dollars
he
had
received
for
retrieving
the
dragon
eye
medderbrook
was
not
extremely
gracious
i
take
it
on
account
he
said
grudgingly
but
it
ought
to
be
more
it
only
brings
what
you
owe
me
for
that
utterly
hopeless
stock
down
to
eleven
thousand
nine
hundred
dollars
and
at
this
rate
you
never
get
me
paid
up
i
ca
tell
when
come
along
another
dividend
of
ten
cumulative
per
cents
on
that
stock
that
i
will
have
to
charge
up
against
you
unless
you
can
do
better
i
have
half
a
mind
not
to
let
you
see
the
telegram
i
got
from
my
daughter
syrilla
this
morning
was
the
news
into
it
good
asked
gubb
eagerly
as
good
as

said
medderbrook
as
good
as
utterly
hopeless
stock
what
did
miss
syrilla
convey
the
remark
of

the
lovelorn
detective

medderbrook
i

telegram
for
one
dollar
and
cents
i

read
it
from
start
to

gubb
his
heart
palpitating
as
only
a
lover
heart
can
palpitate
paid
medderbrook
the
sum
he
asked
and
eagerly
read

medderbrook
as

missive
to
his
lips
but
unless
i
am
mistaken
you

be
still
more
deeply
touched
when
you

and

said
gubb
and
he
returned
to
his
office
in
the
opera
house
block
with
a
light
heart
with
the
increase
of
fame
that
came
to
him
as
a
detective
business
had
grown
and
he
had
left
murphy
house
and
taken
a
room
on
the
second
floor
of
opera
house
block
near
the
offices
of
gilroy
and
dillman
loans
and
real
estate
the
door
now
bore
the
sign
philo
gubb
deteckative
also
on
this
morning
detective
gubb
had
hardly
reached
his
office
when
uncle
gabriel
hostetter
a
shrewd
smile
on
his
face
opened
door
uncle
gabriel
hostetter
was
a
old
man
with
a
long
white
beard
that
came
to
a
thin
point
he
wore
spectacles
the
rims
forming
irregular
octagons
and
on
his
head
he
wore
one
of
the
grandest
old
silk
hats
that
ever
saw
the
light
of
day
in
his
principal
garment
was
a
frock
coat
once
black
but
now
grayish
green
he
was
the
wealthiest
man
in
town
and
it
was
said
that
when
he
once
got
his
hands
on
a
silver
dollar
he
squeezed
it
so
hard
that
the
bird
of
freedom
on
it
uttered
a
squawk
he
opened
philo
gubb
door
hesitatingly
he
expected
to
see
an
array
of
mahogany
desks
and
filing
cabinets
for
which
he
would
have
to
pay
every
time
the
detective
turned
around
when
he
peered
into
the
room
he
saw
a
tall
thin
man
in
white
overalls
with
a
bib
sitting
on
an
bundle
of
stirring
a
pail
of
paste
with
one
hand
while
he
ate
a
ham
sandwich
by
means
of
the
other
i
guess
i
got
in
the
wrong
place
said
uncle
gabe
thought
this
was
a
detective
office
all
right

him
said
philo
gubb

a
hunk
of
sandwich
with
a
gulp
and
wiping
his
hand

his
overalls

old
gabe

what
say
that
fair
enough
you
ai
come
up
any
i
come
all
the
way
down
all
right
then
said
philo
it
a
go
now
who
was
murdered
and
when
was
he
murdered
and
why
was
he
murdered
them
the
things
got
to
know
first

a
dollar
five
for
the
first
day

said
old
gabe
philo
dug
into
his
pocket
and
drew
out
some
money
there
he
said
there
two
dollars
and
ten
cents
that
pays
for
two
days
now
go
ahead
he
drew
out
his
notebook
and
wet
the
end
of
a
pencil
and
waited
the
reason
this
is
such
a
hard
case
said
old
gabe
slowly
and
choosing
his
words
with
care
is
because
the
murder
ai
completed
yet
it
being
did
right
now
exclaimed
philo
excitedly
why
we
ought
to
be
sitting
here
like
this
we
ought
now
do
be
in
such
a
hurry
said
old
gabe
if
you
mean
we
ought
to
be
where
the
victim
of
the
murder
is
we
are
he
right
here
now
i
him
i
the
one
that
being
murdered
i
being
murdered
by
slow
murder
i
liable
to
drop
down
dead
any
minute
but
i
do
want
to
be
murdered
and
not
have
the
feller
that
murders
me
hang
like
he
ought
i
ca
be
expected
to
it
ai
human
nature
no
it
ai
agreed
philo
a
man
ca
help
feeling
revengeful
against
the
man
that
murders
him
if
anybody
murdered
me
i
feel
the
same
way
how
he
killing
you
slow
poison
said
old
gabe
shootin
me
to
death
with
a
gun
the
correspondence
school
detective
looked
at
old
gabe
with
amazement
shootin
you
to
death
with
a
gun
he
exclaimed
ai
you
told
the
police
i
come
to
you
did
i
asked
old
gabe
if
i
was
to
set
the
police
on
the
feller
he
might
rouse
up
and
shoot
me
to
death
all
at
once
how
is
he
shootin
you
to
death
asked
philo
by
inches
said
old
gabe
yes
sir
by
inches
every
once
in
a
while
he
takes
a
shot
at
me
sometimes
through
the
window
of
my
house
and
sometimes
when
i
walkin
on
the
street
and
he
ai
ever
hit
you
yet
asked
philo
gubb
hit
me
exclaimed
old
gabe
why
he
do
ever
miss
me
he
hits
me
every
time
there
ai
a
day
he
do
shoot
and
hit
me
and
some
days
he
hits
me
two
or
three
times
i
dare
say
i
almost
dead
now
if
i
knowed
it
philo
gubb
fondled
his
notebook
uncertainly
what
what
does
he
shoot
you
with
he
asked
well
i
dunno
exactly
said
old
gabe
with
a
philo
gubb
closed
his
notebook
and
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
if
all
you
was
after
was
to
get
that
two
dollars
and
ten
cents
you
might
have
got
it
without
wastin
so
much
of
my
time
he
said
reproachfully
but
old
gabe
did
not
move
what
the
matter
he
asked
maybe
i
a
fool
gubb
said
bitterly
but
i
ai
no
such
fool
as
to
think
anybody
is
murdering
nobody
with
a
was
you
ever
shot
with
a
cannon
asked
old
gabe
calmly
no
nor
nobody
ever
tried
to
murder
me
with
a
said
philo
gubb
if
you
ever
shot
by
a
cannon
ball
said
old
gabe
you
know
it
when
a
cannon
ball
hits
you
there
ai
nothin
left
of
you
at
all
but
when
a
cannon
ball
hits
you
you
got
a
chance
to
live
a
minute
or
two
maybe
that
the
difference
between
a
cannon
ball
shootin
you
and
a
cannon
ball
shootin
you
and
a
rifle
ball
is
different
too
i
got
a
job
of
as
soon
as
i
can
get
away
from
here
said
philo
gubb
meaningly
you
got
a
job
of
detectin
on
hand
now
said
old
gabe
and
as
i
was
sayin
a
rifle
ball
acts
different
maybe
it
kills
you
the
first
shot
and
maybe
you
can
hold
three
or
four
rifle
bullets
before
you
die
but
if
they
keep
on
shootin
at
you
you
get
killed
sooner
or
later
probably
five
shots
is
all
any
man
could
stand
i
guess
about
it
illustration
there
ai
a
day
he
do
shoot
and
hit
me
and
then
you
come
down
to
one
of
them
little
caliber
revolvers
if
he
do
hit
you
in
the
heart
a
murderer
could
easy
enough
shoot
at
you
times
with
one
of
them
little
before
he
killed
you
dead
but
you
be
dead
sooner
or
later
it
just
a
matter
of
what
a
man
shoots
you
with
that
makes
the
difference
in
time
of
course
he
continued
agreeably
you
do
expect
no
to
kill
me
as
quick
as
a
gun
would
if
you
expect
that
you
unreasonable
but
the
principle
is
just
the
same
shootin
is
shootin
you
know
how
that
pome
goes
constant
drip
of
water
wears
away
the
hardest
stone
and
that
just
as
true
of
murderin
a
man
with
a
and
the
beauty
of
it
is
that
nobody
knows
you
committin
a
murder
if
anybody
catches
you
and
asks
you
what
you
doin
you
just
say
nothin
just
shootin
peas
maybe
that
so
agreed
philo
gubb
it
sounds
reasonable
but
the
thing
for
me
to
do
is
to
wait
until
you
dead
and
then
catch
the
feller
it
ai
a
murder
until
you
dead
it
ai
ai
it
sneered
old
gabe
you
wait
until
i
am
dead
i
suppose
and
then
start
out
to
catch
the
feller
and
you
lose
all
the
help
i
can
give
you
it
ai
often
a
detective
can
get
the
corpse
to
help
him
like
this
no
it
ai
agreed
philo
gubb
i
got
a
suspicion
who
the
feller
is
said
gabe
who
asked
philo
gubb
you
go
ahead
with
the
case
on
the
terms
we
settled
on
asked
old
gabe
philo
gubb
considered
this
carefully
why
yes
he
said
at
length
i
will
who
is
the
feller
you
think
is
doin
it
pierce
the
cashier
of
the
farmers
and
citizens
bank
said
old
gabe
his
eyes
shining
with
malice
and
shrewdness
as
he
leaned
forward
and
whispered
the
words
my
own
he
is
i
tell
you
why
he
tryin
it
for
my
money
so
his
wife
get
it
an
he
can
be
president
of
the
bank
in
my
place
you
seen
him
have
a
asked
philo
gubb
no
sir
said
old
gabe
and
i
never
seen
one
of
the
peas
all
i
ever
felt
was
the
sting
of
it
when
it
hit
me
maybe
said
philo
gubb
eagerly
maybe
it
ai
a
maybe
it
a
short
pistol
with
a
silencer
onto
it
maybe
only
because
he
been
afraid
to
come
nigh
enough
to
you
that
he
killed
you
yet
it
do
seem
to
me
that
any
man
would
try
to
murder
any
one
with
a
humph
said
old
gabe
maybe
you
are
right
at
that
something
i
never
thought
of
it
sounds
likely
too
a
deteckative
has
to
think
of
all
them
things
said
philo
simply
if
i
was
you
i
be
more
careful
i
will
said
old
gabe
see
here
if
he
shootin
at
me
like
that
it
ai
no
joke
is
it
tell
you
what
i
do
i
let
you
off
from
payin
me
that
dollar
five
a
day
just
you
hustle
onto
this
case
and
keep
at
it
and
i
leave
you
work
on
it
for
nothin
all
i
want
is
that
you
should
send
me
word
of
what
you
find
out
it
is
the
custom
of
all
the
graduates
of
the
rising
sun
correspondence
school
deteckatives
to
make
reports
in
writing
said
philo
gubb
i
start
right
in
shadowing
and
trailing
mister
farrington
pierce
according
to
lessons
three
and
four
and
i
report
every
day
everything
you
find
out
said
old
gabe
do
leave
out
a
thing
and
particularly
at
night
that
when
he
shoots
me
the
most
i
wo
leave
him
a
minute
said
philo
gubb
i
got
a
man
i
hire
to
help
me
on
my
and
i
get
him
to
finish
up
this
job
i
start
trailin
and
shadowin
farry
pierce
right
away
old
gabe
shook
hands
with
philo
and
went
out
when
the
door
was
closed
behind
him
he
chuckled
and
all
the
way
home
his
face
was
creased
in
a
grin
he
felt
that
he
had
done
a
good
bit
of
business
and
saved
himself
a
good
sum
of
money
philo
gubb
in
the
meantime
having
put
a
false
beard
and
a
wig
in
his
pocket
went
out
across
the
street
from
the
bank
was
grammill
cigar
store
where
the
idler
men
of
the
town
loafed
when
they
had
nothing
better
on
hand
and
philo
gubb
entered
and
bought
a
cigar
and
took
an
easy
loafing
position
near
the
front
window
he
commanded
a
view
of
the
only
entrance
to
the
bank
and
here
he
waited
at
fifteen
minutes
after
three
farry
pierce
came
out
of
the
bank
there
a
man
with
an
easy
job
said
one
of
the
loafers
that
farry
pierce
nothing
to
do
till
too
much
time
on
his
hands
i
guess
said
another
who
by
the
way
had
more
spare
time
than
farry
pierce
from
what
i
hear
he
be
better
off
if
he
had
to
work
all
day
all
night
the
widow
asked
the
first
speaker
that
what
they
say
said
the
second
they
tell
me
he
blowing
all
his
salary
and
more
on
that
widow
must
make
old
gabe
crazy
to
see
any
of
his
kin
spend
money
that
way
or
any
way
he
a
close
one
old
gabe
is
what
you
hear
about
farry
and
the
widow
asked
the
first
makes
old
gabe
crazy
they
tell
me
he
wants
his
girl
to
get
a
divorce
who
told
you
that
my
girl
my
girl
is
workin
for
his
girl
fr
what
she
tells
me
old
gabe
is
pretty
well
worked
up
about
it
said
he
get
a
spotter
to
foller
farry
and
get
some
evidence
on
him
if
it
did
cost
so
blame
much
i
bet
the
wo
be
any
divorces
in
that
family
if
old
gabe
has
to
pay
out
any
money
i
bet
they
wo
and
the
ai
no
detectives
workin
for
nothin
so
far
as
i
hear
not
this
year
no
nor
next
year
neither
said
the
other
and
as
this
was
in
the
nature
of
a
joke
they
both
laughed
but
philo
gubb
did
not
join
their
laughter
he
felt
his
face
grow
red
his
lean
hands
folded
and
unfolded
as
he
watched
farry
pierce
disappear
around
the
corner
of
the
bank
building
if
any
one
felt
like
murdering
old
gabe
with
a
at
that
moment
philo
gubb
did
shadow
and
trail
farry
pierce
the
old
coming
with
a
fairy
tale
and
getting
the
only
fully
graduated
deteckative
in
riverbank
to
shadow
and
trail
a
and
report
daily
divorce
case
evidence
hey
talking
murderer
and
working
a
deteckative
into
doing
scandal
sleuthing
free
of
charge
philo
gubb
face
reddened
again
with
new
anger
as
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
touched
the
beard
and
wig
he
had
placed
there
but
for
this
chance
conversation
he
would
have
been
following
farry
pierce
now
and
making
a
fool
of
himself
but
for
this
chance
conversation
he
would
not
have
lost
sight
of
farry
pierce
by
day
or
by
night
he
went
back
to
his
office
put
on
his
overalls
and
went
to
his
work
on
a
job
at
six
he
started
for
home
a
block
down
the
street
he
met
one
of
the
loafers
he
had
heard
speaking
in
grammill
cigar
store
what
do
you
think
about
it
he
asked
philo
gubb
about
what
asked
philo
in
return
ai
you
heerd
asked
the
man
why
it
all
over
town
by
now
farry
pierce
murdered
old
gabe
hostetter
not
twenty
minutes
after
we
seen
him
comin
out
of
the
bank
shot
him
killed
him
first
shot
yes
sir
killed
him
instantly
with
a
little
mite
of
a
pistol
with
about
as
much
carry
as
a
must
have
hit
him
in
just
the
right
spot
did
you
see
the
pistol
asked
philo
gubb
nervously
no
i
did
said
his
informant
but
that
what
the
feller
told
me
him
instantly
with
one
of
these
here
little
was
what
he
said
what
you
lookin
so
funny
about
if
you
insist
to
wish
to
know
said
philo
gubb
gabe
hostetter
was
murdered
instantly
at
all
he
was
progressively
murdered
by
inches
over
a
long
considerable
period
of
time
like
little
drops
of
water
for
a
minute
the
loafer
stared
at
gubb
then
he
laughed
crazy
he
scoffed
crazy
as
a
loon
and
he
walked
away
and
left
gubb
struggling
for
a
suitably
crushing
retort
the
missing
master
that
evening
gubb
received
a
short
note
from
medderbrook
that
was
in
the
form
of
a
bill
or
statement
it
read
due
from
gubb
to
medderbrook
please
remit
so
he
put
on
his
hat
and
walked
to
medderbrook
elegant
home
i
want
you
to
hurry
up
with
what
you
owe
me
said
medderbrook
when
gubb
explained
that
he
could
pay
nothing
on
the
utterly
hopeless
stock
at
the
moment
because
i
know
you
are
soft
on
syrilla
and
from
a
telegram
i
got
from
her
it
looks
as
if
it
would
be
no
time
at
all
before
she
reduced
her
weight
down
to
seven
hundred
pounds
and
dorgan
of
the
broke
his
contract
with
her
and
if
you
want
to
read
the
telegram
you
can
do
so
by
paying
half
what
it
cost
me
which
was
three
dollars
gubb
paid
medderbrook
one
dollar
and
a
half
as
any
lover
would
and
read
the
telegram
from
syrilla
it
said
love
is
triumphing
have
given
up
all
cereal
diet
have
given
up
oatmeal
rice
farina
puffed
wheat
corn
flakes
hominy
shredded
wheat
force
cream
of
wheat
grapenuts
boiled
barley
popcorn
flour
paste
and
rice
powder
weigh
now
only
nine
hundred
and
pounds
soft
thoughts
to
dearest
gubby
gubb
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
said
far
be
it
from
me
to
say
aught
or
anything
medderbrook
but
i
would
wish
the
cost
of
telegrams
would
reduce
themselves
down
a
little
this
one
is
marked
onto
its
upper
corner
yes
the
telegraph
boy
said
that
was
a
mistake
said
medderbrook
hastily
and
very
likely
so
said
gubb
but
for
a
reduction
of
five
pounds
one
dollar
fifty
is
a
highish
price
to
pay
thirty
cents
a
pound
is
too
much
well
said
medderbrook
i
do
want
to
have
any
quarrel
with
you
so
i
do
this
for
you
i
will
make
you
a
flat
price
of
cents
per
pound
which
is
a
fair
and
reasonable
price
for
glad
tidings
to
a
fond
heart
said
gubb
and
this
matter
having
been
amicably
settled
he
returned
to
his
office
that
evening
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
cot
bed
minus
his
coat
vest
and
trousers
with
his
bare
feet
comfortably
extended
at
his
back
a
pillow
made
a
and
a
bundle
of
served
as
a
rather
lofty
footstool
he
was
deeply
immersed
in
lesson
eleven
his
face
screwed
into
tensity
from
time
to
time
he
wiggled
one
toe
or
another
as
a
fly
alighted
on
it
sometimes
when
more
than
one
fly
alighted
on
his
toes
at
once
he
wiggled
all
ten
toes
simultaneously
a
trunk
a
varnished
oak
washstand
and
a
cot
showed
that
the
room
was
not
only
a
decorator
shop
but
a
and
that
this
was
the
office
of
philo
gubb
detective
was
shown
by
a
row
of
hooks
from
which
hung
various
disguises
used
by
the
celebrated
detective
by
a
portrait
of
william
burns

from
a

and
pasted
on
the

and
by
a

which
read

or
job
terms
on
application
on
the
cot
at
philo
gubb
side
lay
a
copy
of
that
day
morning
chicago
paper
with
a
spread
headline
reading
wife
offers
reward
and
it
was
this
that
had
driven
philo
gubb
the
detective
to
renewed
study
of
lesson
eleven
procedure
in
abduction
and
missing
men
cases
custer
master
of
chicago
had
mysteriously
disappeared
one
paragraph
in
the
article
had
caught
gubb
particular
attention
master
feels
that
her
husband
is
still
alive
and
insists
that
master
will
be
found
in
one
of
the
iowa
towns
on
the
mississippi
river
the
police
of
these
towns
have
been
notified
and
detectives
have
gone
to
investigate
the
masters
stand
high
in
society
master
it
is
understood
recently
inherited
from
a
maternal
uncle
at
the
time
the
will
was
probated
considerable
interest
was
aroused
by
the
fact
that
the
legacy
was
to
go
to
master
only
on
condition
that
he
carried
out
certain
provisions
contained
in
a
sealed
envelope
to
be
read
only
by
the
executors
and
master
and
so
on
the
paper
pointed
out
that
master
had
been
a
sufferer
from
dyspepsia
for
many
years
but
this
had
not
had
a
permanently
depressing
effect
on
his
mind
his
home
relations
were
most
satisfactory
his
own
business
he
was
a
dealer
in
laundry
supplies
and
laundry
machinery
was
doing
well
and
no
trace
of
outside
troubles
could
be
discovered
on
the
morning
of
his
disappearance
master
had
shown
some
signs
of
mental
eccentricity
a
neighbor
happening
to
be
at
her
window
saw
master
come
hurriedly
from
the
door
of
his
house
an
hour
later
a
friend
passed
him
as
he
was
standing
on
a
corner
six
blocks
from
home
master
seemed
greatly
distressed
i
ca
do
it
it
kills
me
i
ca
do
it
he
was
muttering
to
himself
i
never
could
do
it
i
said
so
the
next
news
of
master
was
gained
from
the
keeper
of
a
and
known
as
the
imperial
natatorium
about
ten
master
entered
the
natatorium
hurriedly
asked
the
price
of
baths
and
chose
to
pay
for
a
plunge
in
the
big
he
paid
in
advance
removed
his
garments
in
one
of
the
small
put
on
a
and
went
to
the
edge
of
the
big
pool
here
he
grasped
the
rail
and
extended
one
foot
until
his
toes
touched
the
cold
water
when
he
uttered
a
cry
rushed
to
the
and
as
soon
as
he
had
thrown
on
his
clothes
dashed
from
the
building
that
was
the
last
seen
of
master
philo
gubb
having
finished
reading
lesson
eleven
for
the
third
time
had
picked
up
the
chicago
paper
when
the
silence
of
the
opera
house
building
was
disturbed
by
the
sound
of
feet
ascending
the
stairs
the
nocturnal
visitors
seemed
unacquainted
with
the
building
for
after
two
or
three
steps
had
been
taken
one
lighted
a
match
it
was
evident
to
the
detective
that
these
visitors
were
reading
the
names
on
the
doors
as
they
progressed
along
the
corridor
and
he
was
about
to
extinguish
his
lamp
and
prepare
for
the
worst
when
the
two
men
stopped
again
struck
a
match
and
after
an
instant
hesitation
rapped
sharply
upon
his
door
come
in
called
philo
gubb
at
the
same
time
drawing
his
over
his
scantily
clad
legs
he
knotted
the
sheet
behind
like
an
apron
and
arose
to
greet
the
comers
they
were
two
one
of
them
gubb
recognized
at
once
he
was
billy
gribble
proprietor
of
the
gold
star
hand
laundry
just
across
the
way
on
main
street
the
other
man
was
a
stranger
under
his
arm
billy
gribble
carried
a
long
cylindrical
parcel
enclosed
in
heavy
wrapping
paper
the
parcel
was
about
six
feet
long
and
nearly
as
large
around
as
billy
himself
under
his
other
arm
billy
carried
a
second
parcel
this
was
about
three
feet
square
the
trained
eye
of
detective
gubb
noted
all
this
at
a
glance
billy
gribble
dropped
the
two
parcels
on
the
floor
gubby
old
sport
he
said
in
his
noisy
way

at
the
man
the
man
was
tall
and
thin

and
thinner
than
gubb
himself
he
was
and
his
face
showed
deep
lines
about
the
mouth
and
nose
his
hair
was
closely
clipped
making
his
head
seem
in
its
smallness
but
gubb
was
not
gazing
at
these
things
his
eyes
were
fastened
on
the
end
of
the
suitcase
the
stranger
still
held
in
his
hand

the
end
of
the
case
were
painted
in
black
the
letters
and
the
word

the
stranger
glanced
down
at
the
suitcase
and
put
it
on
the
floor
with
a
suddenness
that
brought
forth
a
thumping
sound
clue
he
said
and
he
kicked
the
suitcase
i
presume

honor
of
this

hour

i
waited
and
he
came
back
asked
detective
gubb
eagerly

said
witzel
philo
gubb
sighed
with
relief
then
i
got
a
chance
at
an
opportunity
to
get
that
five
thousand
dollars
he
said
gubb
said
witzel
you
have
a
chance
to

gribble
you

i
said
to
gribble
said
witzel
slowly
is
this
the
town
where
a
detective
by
the
name
of
grubb
lives
gubb
is
the
name
said
gubb
gubb
that
what
i
said
said
witzel
that
made
me
think
a
bit
i
says
there
will
be
forty
chicago
detectives
in
his
town
all
looking
for
master
and
i
do
care
a
whoop
for
any
of
them
i
says
the
leader
of
them
all
as
anybody
who
has
read
the
exploits
of
of
george
augustus
wechsler
charles
augustus
witzel
said
gribble
correctingly
i
have
so
many
i
forget
them
said
witzel
to
gubb
you
understand
that
perfectly
you
are
a
detective
and
i
a
detective
witzel
or
wotzel
or
wutzel
who
cares
we
understand
each
other
do
we
i
presume
to
suppose
we
will
do
so
in
the
course
of
time
said
philo
gubb
politely
said
witzel
so
i
said
to
gribble
afraid
of
gubb
he
the
man
who
will
find
master
if
i
do
but
i
got
an
advantage
i
got
the
clue
he
pointed
to
the
suitcase
so
gribble
says
to
me
said
witzel
do
you
and
gubb
combine
idea
i
says
and
here
i
am
how
about
it
mr
gobb
gubb
is
the
name
i
adhere
to
when
not
deteckating
said
gubb
kindly
and
as
to
how
about
it
i
would
want
to
enter
into
a
combination
shutting
me
out
from
using
the
ability
taught
to
me
in
chapters
one
to
twelve
inclusive
of
the
correspondence
course
for
the
hundred
which
would
fall
to
my
share
i
should
expect
to
detect
to
some
considerable
extent
quite
right
right
said
witzel
promptly
that
meets
my
plans
entirely
i
make
my
headquarters
here
i
give
you
a
free
hand
i
am
a
an
inductive
detective
yes
sir
a
sherlock
holmes
deteckative
said
philo
gubb
said
witzel
i
think
things
out
but
you
go
out
you
shadow
and
snoop
and
trail
i
remain
here
for
you
see
he
added
i
so
well
known
that
if
master
saw
me
he
would
disappear
instantly
instantly
i
willing
to
transact
it
as
a
business
bargain
onto
them
terms
said
philo
gubb
and
it
was
agreed
gribble
immediately
cut
the
cords
that
bound
the
two
bundles
and
released
a
canvas
cot
and
a
bundle
of
bedding
then
he
said
and
withdrew
closing
the
door
behind
him
gubb
waited
until
he
heard
gribble
footsteps
on
the
stairs
that
gribble
man
ai
what
i
term
by
name
of
a
of
a
he
hesitated
he
not
known
as
a
strictly
reliable
citizen
in
any
respect
he
ended
i
would
trust
him
any
more
than
need
be
necessary
thank
you
said
witzel
who
was
already
removing
his
garments
i
do
mean
to
and
now
if
you
do
mind
i
retire
let
see
if
master
has
a
in
his
suitcase
i
think
it
helps
the
inductive
mind
to
sleep
in
the
of
the
man
it
is
hunting
he
opened
the
suitcase
using
oddly
enough
a
key
from
his
own
bunch
of
keys
he
found
a
and
put
it
on
to
his
surprise
it
fitted
him
exactly
which
was
odd
for
witzel
was
an
unusually
tall
and
thin
man
without
wasting
time
he
climbed
into
the
cot
and
closed
his
eyes
gubb
also
retired
philo
gubb
from
his
cot
watched
witzel
until
he
was
sure
he
was
thoroughly
asleep
then
the
correspondence
school
detective
slipped
out
of
bed
and
knelt
over
the
suitcase
the
suitcase
contained
linen
all
plainly
marked
the
name
master
was
written
in
indelible
ink
on
each
piece
an
extra
suit
of
outer
garments
was
marked
with
master
name
there
were
toilet
articles
engraved
with
master
name
and
these
gubb
examined
closely
but
what
caught
and
held
his
interest
most
was
a
folded
document
covered
in
paper
and
endorsed
last
will
and
testament
of
orlando
higgins
copy
the
will
began
with
the
usual
preamble
but
the
clause
that
caught
philo
gubb
eye
and
held
it
was
the
next
to
my
nephew
custer
master
this
clause
said
i
give
and
bequeath
but
be
it
understood
my
said
nephew
custer
master
shall
benefit
by
this
clause
only
in
case
he
faithfully
carries
out
the
instructions
contained
in
the
sealed
envelope
attached
hereto
the
contents
of
said
envelope
to
be
read
by
my
hereinafter
named
executors
and
the
said
custer
master
and
not
by
any
other
persons
whatsoever
the
said
executors
are
to
be
the
sole
judges
of
whether
the
said
custer
master
has
carried
out
the
instructions
therein
contained
this
document
was
worn
at
the
corners
of
the
folds
and
slightly
soiled
as
if
master
had
carried
it
in
his
pocket
some
time
before
dropping
it
in
his
suitcase
with
the
same
caution
and
following
closely
lesson
three
and
its
directions
for
searching
occupied
apartments
gubb
examined
the
articles
of
dress
the
chicago
detective
had
cast
aside
all
were
marked
master
or
or
with
a
monogram
composed
of
the
letters
interwoven
as
cautiously
as
he
could
philo
gubb
crossed
to
his
trunk
and
took
from
the
compartment
of
the
tray
his
trusty
pistol
it
was
a
large
and
deadly
looking
pistol
about
a
foot
and
a
half
long
with
a
small
ramrod
beneath
the
barrel
it
was
a
of
the
crop
of
and
carried
a
bullet
the
size
of
a
cherry
it
was
as
heavy
as
a
vitrified
its
efficiency
as
a
firearm
was
unknown
as
gubb
had
never
discharged
it
but
it
looked
dangerous
a
man
facing
philo
gubb
trusty
weapon
felt
that
if
the
gun
went
off
he
would
be
utterly
and
disastrously
blown
to
flinders
gubb
pointed
it
at
the
sleeping
witzel
using
both
hands
and
sighting
along
the
barrel
wake
up
he
exclaimed
sternly
witzel
sat
straight
up
on
the
cot
for
an
instant
he
was
still
dazed
with
sleep
and
did
not
seem
to
know
where
he
was
then
a
look
of
joy
spread
over
his
face
and
he
jumped
from
the
cot
and
with
both
hands
extended
moved
toward
detective
gubb
superb
he
exclaimed
a
perfect
specimen
wonderfully
preserved
go
back
said
philo
gubb
sternly
this
article
is
a
loaded
pistol
gun
prepared
for
momentary
explosion
at
any
time
at
all
go
back
remarkable
cried
witzel
joyously
a
superb
specimen
let
me
see
it
let
me
look
at
it
he
walked
up
to
the
gun
and
peered
into
its
muzzle
with
one
eye
he
bent
his
head
to
read
the
engraving
on
the
top
of
the
barrel
a
real
briggs
bolton
caliber
he
exclaimed
rapturously
gubb
pushed
him
away
with
one
hand
go
back
there
into
range
he
said
sternly
in
shooting
i
aim
to
kill
but
not
to
blow
into
particles
of
pieces
but
my
dear
sir
exclaimed
witzel

a
pistol

philo
gubb
if
you

witzel
that

it
is

gubb
it

a
briggs
bolton
and
i
warn
you
that

that
gun
so
full
of
powder
that
if

and
ruin
the
only
perfect
specimen
of
that
gun
i
ever

philo
gubb
sternly
that

gun

back
there
where
i
can
shoot

i
wo
said
witzel
angrily
philo
gubb
was
slow
to
anger
but
he
was
sorely
pressed
now
and
his
temper
failed
him
look
here
he
said
to
witzel
if
you
do
go
back
where
i
can
get
a
shot
at
you
i
i
smack
you
on
the
face
if
you
shoot
off
that
gun
and
bust

said
witzel
with
equal
anger
i
i
hit
you
on
the
head

back
cried
philo
gubb
menacingly
one
i
give
you
fifty
dollars
for
that
gun
just

witzel
two

gubb
sixty
dollars

witzel
th
said
the
detective
stepping
backward
to
get
room
to
sight
along
the
long
barrel
unfortunately
the
trunk
was
just
behind
him
and
as
he
stepped
back
he
tripped
over
it
and
fell
backward
doubling
up
like
a
but
he
kept
his
presence
of
mind
the
long
barrel
of
the
briggs
bolton
protruded
from
between
the
soles
of
philo
gubb
feet
in
witzel
direction
hands
up
he
said
instantly
witzel
raised
his
hands
in
the
air
i
give
you
seventy
dollars
he
said
make
it
said
gubb
and
as
soon
as
i
done
with
it
you
can
have
it
it
a
bargain
said
witzel
happily
it
my
pistol
now
what
all
this
nonsense
about
shooting
me
is
an
insufficient
word
to
use
in
relation
to
this
here
case
said
philo
gubb
grimly
it
wo
be
nonsense
for
you
when
you
get
through
with
it
what
did
you
do
with
the
corpse
with
the
with
the
cried
witzel
the
remains
said
gubb
what
did
you
do
with
them
the
remains
of
what
asked
witzel
of
mister
custer
master
said
philo
gubb
easing
himself
a
little
by
shifting
one
waving
foot
there
is
no
need
to
pretend
to
play
innocent
where
is
the
body
my
dear
detective
gubb
exclaimed
witzel
i

nothing
about
any
body

said
philo
gubb
maybe
so
but

your
clothes

of
mister

the
question
is

or

you
and
william
gribble
murder
him
together
mouth
fell
open
murder
him
he
exclaimed
aghast
but
but
in
the
name
of
the
law
said
philo
gubb
i
take
you
into
custody
for
the
murder
and
disappearing
bodyliness
of

trunk
and
i
put

in
proper
shape
and

witzel
turned
all
but
his
head
he
kept
his
face
toward
the
priceless
or
more
properly
briggs
bolton
gubb
he
said
you
are
making
a
serious
mistake
i
am
a
detective
you
ai
said
philo
gubb
i
searched
all
your
things
and
you
ai
got
a
silver
badge
nor
a
false
mustache
nowhere
i
going
to
turn
you
right
over
to
the
police
morning
to
the
police
exclaimed
witzel
do
do
that
whatever
you
do
do
do
that
and
suddenly
like
a
nervous
dyspeptic
suddenly
overwrought
witzel
broke
down
and
falling
on
the
cot
began
to
sob
philo
gubb
looked
at
him
a
moment
with
amazement
then
he
dug
a
pair
of
handcuffs
out
of
his
trunk
and
walking
to
where
witzel
lay
prodded
him
in
the
back
with
the
muzzle
of
the
pistol
witzel
turned
quickly
rolling
over
like
an
eel
stop
it
you
tickling
me
i
ca
stand
tickling
he
cried
i
i
ca
stand
lots
of
things

i
the
most
sensitive
man
in
the
world
i
i
ca
stand
cold

all
well
nobody

said
philo
gubb
handcuffs
cold
water
but
cold
water
is
said
witzel
cold
water
kills
me
it
makes
me
shiver
and
turn
blue
and
and
gives
me
cramps
in
the
palms
of
my
hands
and
the
soles
of
my
feet
i
listen
my
doctor
says
cold
baths
will
kill
me
the
shock
of
bad
heart
you

philo
gubb
eyes
blinked
i
tell
said
witzel
grasping
gubb
hand
i
cold
baths
they
kill
me
you
understand
it
would
be
suicide
so
so
i
knew
billy
gribble

i
set
him
up
in
business
here
to
get
rid
of
him
do
he
owe
me
a
good

he
asked
philo
gubb
has
he
two
bathrooms
in
connection
with
his
laundry
and
cold
baths
all
hours
ladies
tuesdays
and

frank
i
am
custer
master
illustration
the
missing
master
the
reward
for
who
for
who
the
reward
said
philo
gubb
seeking
a
grammatical
form
that
would
sound
right
for
information
as
to
which
five
thousand
dollars
reward
is
offered
exactly
said
master
and
i
will
make
it
six
thousand
if
you
do
not
give
information
i
admit
i
am
master
i
am
custer
master
here
read
this
he
reached
for
his
vest
and
from
the
pocket
took
a
slip
of
paper
it
was
typewritten
and
headed
secret
stipulation
regarding
custer
master
clause
of
orlando
higgins
will
copy
being
a
firm
believer
in
the
efficacy
of
cold
baths
for
the
cure
of
dyspepsia
and
having
been
laughed
at
for
same
by
my
nephew
custer
master
and
feeling
that
a
course
of
baths
would
cure
him
i
make
it
a
part
of
my
will
and
testament
that
the
sum
or
sums
bequeathed
to
him
shall
be
given
to
him
only
after
he
has
faithfully
and
upon
the
sworn
testimony
of
an
bathed
for
twelve
minutes
every
morning
for
one
month
of
thirty
days
in
water
cleanliness
may
be
next
to
godliness
said
master
but
baths
are
my
shortest
road
to
a
future
state
and
i
not
ready
for
that
yet
still
i
did
not
like
to
give
up
to
billy
gribble
he
added
with
a
meaning
smile
all
baths
are
cold
baths
i
hold
a
mortgage
on
his
laundry
machinery
and
so
you
came
up
here
to
my
office
to
hide
whilst
bathing
in
at
mister
gribble
said
philo
gubb
exactly
said
master
if
you
ai
got
six
thousand
and
dollars
by
you
said
philo
gubb
simply
you
can
give
me
a
check
for
the
whole
amount
in
the
morning
but
if
you
go
to
take
the
bullet
out
of
this
pistol
you
have
to
get
an
auger
i
made
the
bullet
myself
and
it
was
too
big
and
i
had
to
pound
it
into
the
gun
with
a
hammer
and
it
in
good
and
safe
and
you
would
have
dared
to
pull
the
trigger
asked
master
i
would
have
dared
so
to
do
said
gubb
it
would
have
blown
the
pistol
to
atoms
exclaimed
master
it
would
so
have
done
said
gubb
except
for
the
time
i
loaded
it
being
the
first
beginning
time
i
ever
loaded
a
pistol
in
loading
a
briggs
bolton
i
have
since
subsequently
learned
the
powder
ought
to
go
into
it
first
and
the
bullet
second
i
put
the
bullet
in
first
well
bless
my
stars
exclaimed
master
bless
my
stars
if
that
is
the
case
if
that
is
the
case
i
going
to
bed
again
i
have
to
get
up
before
daylight
to
take
a
bath
waffles
and
mustard
it
would
not
be
true
to
say
that
gubb
had
become
suspicious
of
medderbrook
honesty
the
fact
that
the
cashier
of
the
riverbank
national
bank
told
him
the
utterly
hopeless
stock
was
not
worth
the
paper
it
was
printed
on
did
pain
him
however
it
pained
gubb
to
think
his
might
be
guilty
of
even
unconscious
duplicity
and
when
master
paid
him
the
six
thousand
and
dollars
gubb
decided
that
only
three
thousand
dollars
of
it
should
pass
immediately
into
hands
gubb
put
two
thousand
dollars
in
the
bank
and
invested
the
balance
in
furniture
for
his
office
and
in
articles
and
instruments
that
were
needed
for
his
detective
career
the
three
thousand
dollars
he
took
to
medderbrook
and
paid
it
to
him
leaving
only
eight
thousand
nine
hundred
dollars
unpaid
medderbrook
was
greatly
pleased
with
this
and
told
gubb
so
this
is
a
bully
payment
on
account
he
said
and
if
you
keep
on
this
way
you
soon
be
all
paid
up
but
you
do
want
to
let
that
worry
you
for
i
having
a
lot
of
stock
in
a
mine
printed
and
i
sell
you
a
whole
lot
of
it
as
soon
as
we
are
square
i
going
to
call
it
the
little
syrilla
i
do
think
i
buy
any
more
stock
after
the
present
lot
is
paid
up
completely
full
said
gubb
that
all
right
said
medderbrook
i
have
given
the
printer
final
orders
yet
and
if
you
prefer
something
else
i
make
it
stock
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
the
property
will
produce
just
as
much
oil
as
it
will
gold
every
bit
have
you
heard
from
miss
syrilla
recently
of
late
asked
gubb
yes
i
have
said
medderbrook
i
have
heard
two
dollars
and
a
half
worth
the
telegram
which
medderbrook
permitted
gubb
to
read
after
he
had
paid
the
cash
in
hand
said
heaven
smiles
on
us
have
given
up
all
vegetable
diet
have
given
up
potatoes
beets
artichokes

swiss

only

hundred

fifteen
pounds
dorgan
worried
i
dream
of
gubby
and
love
gubb
sighed
happily
i
suppose
he
said
blissfully
that
by
the
present
moment
of
time
miss
syrilla
has
only
got
left
a
remainder
of
six
double
chins
out
of
seven
dear
little
one
and
he
went
back
to
his
office
feeling
that
it
would
not
be
long
now
before
the
apple
of
his
eye
was
released
from
her
contract
the
next
day
gubb
had
begun
his
labors
on
a
new
and
interesting
case
when
the
door
opened
gubb
come
across
the
hall
here
gubb
looked
up
from
the
labor
in
which
he
was
engaged
and
blinked
at
lawyer
higgins
at
the
present
time
i
am
momently
engaged
upon
a
case
said
gubb
as
soon
as
i
am
disengaged
away
from
what
i
am
at
i
expect
to
be
engaged
at
the
next
thing
i
have
to
do
i
should
wish
to
assume
to
be
rude
higgins
but
when
a
deteckative
is
working
up
a
case
and
has
a
sign
on
his
door
back
at
midnight
he
generally
means
he
ai
receiving
callers
on
no
account
that
all
right
said
higgins
briskly
but
this
is
business
got
a
real
job
for
you
i
am
engaged
upon
a
real
job
now
said
philo
gubb
this
is
a
detective
job
said
higgins
we
want
you
to
find
a
man
and
if
you
find
him
there
two
hundred
dollars
in
it
for
you
what
sort
of
a
job
is
it
you
have
on
hand
i
am
searching
out
the
whereabouts
of
a
lost
party
said
gubb
earnestly
i
investigating
clues
at
the
present
time
and
moment
higgins
stepped
inside
the
door
he
walked
to
where
philo
gubb
sat
at
an
elaborate
mahogany
desk
and
looked
at
the
apparatus
gubb
was
using
what
the
dickens
he
asked
on
the
slide
of
the
desk
were
grouped
a
number
of
small
articles
and
a
large
and
powerful
microscope
through
the
lens
of
the
microscope
gubb
was
inspecting
something
that
looked
like
frayed
wool
yarn
you
do
expect
to
find
your
missing
party
in
that
wad
of
wool
do
you
gubb
asked
higgins
jestingly
maybe
i
do
and
maybe
the
operations
of
the
deteckative
mind
are
none
of
your
particular
affair
when
conducted
in
the
private
seclusion
of
my
laboratory
said
gubb
now
do
get
mad
said
higgins
it
just
struck
me
as
funny
looks
as
if
you
were
hunting
for
fleas
in
a
wisp
of
dog
hair
philo
gubb
looked
up
quickly
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
but
a
moment
before
found
a
flea
in
the
wool
he
was
examining
and
the
wool
was
indeed
a
wisp
of
dog
hair
the
party
gubb
had
been
engaged
to
find
was
a
dog
and
gubb
was
by
the
inductive
method
of
detecting
trying
to
reason
out
the
location
of
the
dog
by
the
aid
of
the
microscope
gubb
was
searching
for
the
slight
indications
that
mean
so
much
to
detectives
unfortunately
however
gubb
had
not
yet
found
anything
from
which
he
could
deduce
anything
whatever
unless
the
flea
in
the
wool
might
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
dog
now
or
once
had
fleas
tell
you
what
i
want
said
higgins
i
want
you
to
find
mustard
detective
gubb
swung
suddenly
in
his
chair
and
faced
higgins
i
do
want
nothing
more
to
do
with
that
will
he
said
i
with
you
there
said
higgins
laughing
when
made
his
will
so
that
my
client
could
get
her
rights
at
once
he
did
a
mean
trick
and
i
dare
say
doblin
will
think
so
when
she
gets
my
bill
but
just
the
same
gubb
you
in
the
detective
business
more
or
less
and
it
strikes
me
you
ought
to
take
a
job
when
it
offered
to
you
you
signed
the
will
as
a
witness
and
this
man
bilton
commonly
known
as
mustard
on
account
of
his
yellow
complexion
and
hair
was
the
other
witness
was
he
now
if
you
ca
give
us
the
information
we
want
and
mustard
can
it
looks
to
me
as
if
it
was
your
duty
as
a
fellow
witness
to
hunt
him
up
but
we
do
ask
that
we
willing
to
pay
you
if
you
find
him
are
you
prepared
to
contract
to
say
you
pay
me
just
for
hunting
for
him
asked
gubb
we
give
you
two
hundred
dollars
if
you
can
produce
mustard
here
in
riverbank
said
higgins
the
job
i
took
on
to
hunt
up
another
missing
party
will
occupy
me
for
quite
a
while
i
guess
said
gubb
but
maybe
i
might
put
in
what
extra
time
i
can
spare
looking
for
your
party
do
it
said
higgins
i
do
say
you
the
best
detective
in
the
world
gubb
but
you
do
have
luck
you
must
have
a
magic
talisman
the
operation
of
the
deteckative
mind
is
always
like
magic
to
the
common
folks
said
gubb
gravely
all
right
then
said
higgins
two
hundred
if
you
find
him
and
now
will
you
just
come
across
the
hall
for
one
minute
gubb
left
his
microscope
reluctantly
he
was
sick
and
tired
of
the
will
but
he
followed
higgins
the
second
floor
of
the
opera
house
block
was
laid
out
in
small
offices
arranged
on
two
sides
of
a
corridor
one
of
these
offices
had
been
for
many
years
the
office
of
haddon
who
specialized
in
commercial
law
collections
and
jokes
and
he
had
accumulated
a
snug
little
fortune
it
was
said
he
could
draw
a
contract
no
one
could
break
except
himself
on
the
streets
and
in
his
home
and
at
his
office
except
when
at
work
on
some
especially
difficult
case
his
face
always
wore
a
quizzical
smile
seemed
to
enjoy
himself
every
moment
walking
along
the
street
he
would
suddenly
stop
some
citizen
enunciate
a
dozen
or
twenty
cryptic
words
laugh
and
proceed
on
his
way
leaving
the
citizen
to
puzzle
over
the
affair
lose
interest
in
it
and
forget
it
a
week
a
month
or
a
year
later
would
stop
the
same
citizen
and
utter
ten
more
words
the
key
to
the
cryptic
joke
then
chuckling
he
would
hurry
away
he
had
a
lot
of
fun
his
keen
brain
felt
equal
to
making
fun
of
the
whole
town
and
not
letting
the
town
know
it
money
came
to
him
easily
he
had
no
wife
his
pleasure
was
in
his
books
and
he
was
probably
a
happy
man
but
he
died
he
died
and
left
a
will
for
some
years
lived
with
his
niece
an
orphan
she
was
eighteen
and
there
might
have
been
some
gossip
but
forestalled
it
by
hiring
old
mullarky
bought
his
niece
a
pup
and
had
a
built
and
put
in
the
yard
he
christened
the
pup
himself
naming
it
waffles
because
he
said
the
minute
he
saw
the
pup
it
reminded
him
of
dolly
the
pup
was
just
the
color
of
the
waffles
dolly
baked
baked
is
word
so
he
bought
waffles
and
brought
him
home
to
dolly
and
the
girl
loved
the
dog
from
the
first
minute
then
just
as
the
dog
had
outgrown
puppyhood
died
his
will
was
found
in
the
safe
in
his
office
old
judge
mackinnon
who
shared
the
office
with
found
the
will
the
day
after
died
it
was
in
a
white
legal
envelope
endorsed
my
will
haddon
the
judge
opened
the
envelope
it
was
not
sealed
and
took
out
the
will
the
will
was
not
filled
in
on
a
printed
form
it
was
a
holograph
will
written
in
own
hand
it
began
in
the
usual
formal
manner
and
there
were
two
bequests
the
first
read
to
my
niece
dorothy
since
she
is
so
extremely
fond
of
her
dog
waffles
i
give
and
bequeath
the
now
on
my
property
at
locust
street
riverbank
iowa
the
second
read
secondly
to
my
cousin
ardelia
doblin
i
bequeath
the
entire
remainder
and
residue
of
my
estate
etc
judge
mackinnon
frowned
as
he
read
these
two
bequests
he
knew
ardelia
doblin
as
a
spiteful
woman
to
cut
off
dolly
with
a
and
give
his
entire
estate
to
ardelia
doblin
might
be
idea
of
a
joke
but
the
judge
did
not
like
it
he
read
the
final
clause
appointing
him
sole
executor
without
bond
signature
was
correctly
appended
the
will
was
dated
july
it
was
witnessed
by
philo
gubb
and
max
bilton
the
judge
knew
both
witnesses
gubb
was
the
eccentric
who
thought
he
was
a
detective
because
he
had
taken
a
correspondence
course
and
bilton
was
a
jaundiced
loafer
commonly
called
mustard
the
good
old
man
sighed
and
was
about
to
put
the
will
back
in
the
envelope
when
he
noticed
three
letters
at
the
bottom
of
the
sheet
they
were
now
is
an
english
abbreviation
that
means
please
turn
over
the
judge
turned
the
paper
over
suddenly
he
smiled
then
he
looked
grave
again
and
then
he
grinned
after
which
he
shook
his
head
the
reverse
of
the
sheet
contained
a
will
exactly
like
that
on
the
obverse
word
for
word
it
was
the
same
line
for
line
punctuation
mark
for
punctuation
mark
the
two
wills
on
the
opposite
sides
of
the
sheet
were
identical
except
for
two
words
in
the
will
the
judge
was
now
reading
the
name
sarah
kinsey
was
substituted
for
the
name
ardelia
doblin
the
date
was
the
same
the
witnesses
were
the
same
there
were
two
wills
one
written
on
one
side
of
the
sheet
and
the
other
written
on
the
other
side
of
the
sheet
of
the
same
date
with
the
same
signature
and
with
the
same
witnesses
had
joked
to
the
last
this
is
a
dickens
of
a
joke
exclaimed
judge
mackinnon
should
not
have
done
this
he
saw
the
property
of
haddon
being
dissipated
in
lawsuits
over
this
remarkable
will
he
knew
sarah
kinsey
as
well
as
he
knew
ardelia
doblin
and
she
was
just
such
another
mean
cantankerous
individual
a
joke
a
joke
but
you
should
have
done
this
said
the
judge
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
notify
the
parties
concerned
he
went
to
see
dolly
first
and
told
her
as
gently
as
he
could
about
the
will
she
cried
a
little
softly
at
first
and
then
she
smiled
bravely
you
must
worry
about
it
judge
mackinnon
she
said
i
of
course
i
never
thought
what
uncle
haddon
would
do
with
his
money
and
and
we
used
to
joke
about
the
he
always
said
he
would
leave
it
to
me
in
his
will
uncle
haddon
loved
to
joke
judge
mackinnon
he
was
a
joking
jackanapes
said
judge
mackinnon
angrily
ardelia
doblin
and
sarah
kinsey
took
the
matter
in
quite
a
different
spirit
doblin
could
hardly
wait
until
judge
mackinnon
was
out
of
the
house
before
she
hurried
down
to
see
lawyer
higgins
and
kinsey
did
not
wait
until
the
judge
was
ready
to
go
but
put
on
her
hat
in
his
presence
so
eager
was
she
to
hurry
down
to
see
lawyer
burch
ten
hours
later
the
will
was
the
one
matter
talked
about
in
riverbank
evidently
there
must
be
some
clue
leading
to
the
solution
of
the
mystery
some
cleverly
planned
key
such
as
haddon
would
undoubtedly
have
left
in
perpetrating
such
a
joke
common
sense
was
sufficient
to
tell
any
one
that
could
not
have
written
both
wills
simultaneously
that
he
had
written
one
will
on
one
side
of
the
paper
after
which
he
had
turned
the
paper
over
and
had
written
the
other
will
on
the
other
side
of
the
paper
the
difficulty
was
to
tell
which
side
he
had
written
last
lawyer
higgins
lawyer
burch
and
judge
mackinnon
went
over
both
sides
of
the
paper
with
a
microscope
the
same
ink
had
been
used
on
both
sides
writing
was
the
same
on
both
sides
often
in
writing
as
many
words
as
occupied
both
sides
of
the
paper
in
question
a
hand
grows
involuntarily
weary
there
was
nothing
of
this
sort
there
seemed
to
be
absolutely
nothing
on
which
the
greatest
penmanship
expert
could
base
a
plea
that
either
side
was
in
fact
the
will
of
haddon
either
might
be
the
last
nothing
was
left
untested
by
higgins
and
burch
the
two
sides
of
the
paper
on
which
the
wills
were
written
were
subjected
to
the
minutest
scrutiny
each
will
was
witnessed
by
the
same
pair
of
witnesses
and
these
were
philo
gubb
and
max
bilton
it
was
no
trouble
to
get
philo
gubb
to
tell
about
signing
the
will
judge
mackinnon
crossed
the
hall
and
brought
philo
gubb
to
the
office
yes
sir
said
gubb
i
signed
my
signature
onto
that
document
two
times
as
requested
so
to
do
by
the
late
deceased
he
come
over
to
my
official
deteckative
headquarters
and
asked
me
to
step
across
and
do
him
the
pleasure
of
a
small
favor
and
i
done
so
yes
sir
my
signed
signature
and
that
my
signed
signature
also
likewise
did
he
say
anything
mr
gubb
asked
the
judge
he
says
this
is
my
last
will
and
testament
and
i
wish
you
to
sign
your
signature
onto
it
as
a
witness
so
he
put
the
paper
in
front
of
me
i
sign
it
i
says
it
right
here
under
bilton
name
he
says
so
i
signed
my
signature
like
he
told
me
yes
said
the
judge
and
blotted
it
with
a
piece
of
did
he
not
he
so
done
said
gubb
and
then
what
then
he
turned
the
paper
over
said
gubb
and
he
says
please
sign
this
one
so
i
signed
it
under
bilton
name
again
said
the
judge
why
no
said
the
detective
not
under
it
because
it
was
located
nowhere
to
have
an
under
to
it
bilton
signed
on
that
side
yet
there
was
an
instant
sensation
bilton
had
signed
that
side
said
higgins
which
side
he
signed
the
other
side
from
the
side
he
had
signed
said
gubb
did
you
notice
which
side
he
had
not
signed
insisted
higgins
was
it
this
side
that
mentions
doblin
or
this
side
that
mentions
kinsey
which
was
it
gubb
took
the
paper
and
examined
it
carefully
he
turned
it
over
and
over
could
say
he
said
briefly
in
other
words
said
burch
you
signed
one
side
before
bilton
signed
and
one
side
after
he
signed
but
you
do
know
which
yes
sir
i
do
said
gubb
so
said
judge
mackinnon
with
a
smile
you
can
swear
you
signed
both
these
wills
as
witness
but
you
have
no
idea
which
you
signed
last
mr
gubb
so
said
gubb
with
emphasis
now
just
a
minute
said
burch
one
of
these
bilton
signatures
is
bilton
and
the
other
is
bilton
you
do
recall
which
was
on
the
paper
when
you
signed
do
you
burch
said
gubb
i
was
taking
no
extra
time
to
find
out
if
a
feller
like
mustard
bilton
signed
his
name
or
max
or
methuselah
no
sir
do
you
know
where
mustard
bilton
is
now
asked
judge
mackinnon
do
know
said
gubb
the
three
lawyers
consulted
for
a
minute
or
two
then
the
judge
turned
to
gubb
again
and
did
say
anything
more
on
the
occasion
when
you
signed
the
will
asked
the
judge
he
said
you
said
gubb
he
said
you
sherlock
holmes
higgins
and
burch
laughed
and
even
the
judge
smiled
and
they
told
gubb
he
could
go
an
hour
or
three
quarters
of
an
hour
after
he
had
been
called
to
identify
his
signature
to
the
wills
a
gentle
tap
at
gubb
door
caused
him
to
look
up
from
the
pamphlet
lesson
four
rising
sun
detective
agency
correspondence
school
of
detecting
he
was
reading
come
on
right
in
he
called
and
in
answer
the
door
opened
and
a
young
woman
entered
she
was
a
girl
and
when
she
pushed
back
her
veil
gubb
saw
she
had
been
weeping
for
her
eyes
were
red
gubb
hastily
pulled
out
his
desk
chair
take
a
seat
and
set
down
he
said
politely
is
there
anything
in
my
lines
i
can
be
doing
for
you
are
you
philo
gubb
she
asked
seating
herself
yes
and
deteckating
done
he
said
it
about
a
dog
my
dog
said
the
young
woman
he
lost
or
stolen
and
emotion
choked
her
words
i
know
it
sounds
foolish
to
ask
a
detective
to
look
for
a
dog
she
said
with
a
poor
attempt
at
a
smile
but
in
the
deteckative
line
nothing
sounds
foolish
said
gubb
with
politeness
but
uncle
haddon
told
me
once
that
if
ever
i
needed
a
a
detective
i
should
come
to
you
the
young
woman
continued
you
knew
uncle
haddon
mr
gubb
i
had
the
pleasure
of
being
known
to
and
knowing
of
him
said
gubb
my
name
is
dolly
i
am
his
niece
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
said
philo
gubb
and
he
shook
hands
gravely
he
gave
me
my
dog
said
miss
he
gave
him
to
me
when
the
dog
was
just
a
puppy
and
he
called
him
waffles
he
used
to
joke
about
my
loving
the
dog
more
than
i
loved
him
he
used
to
say
miss
wiped
her
eyes
for
a
moment
she
could
not
speak
he
used
to
say
she
continued
in
a
moment
that
i
never
break
my
heart
over
a
lost
uncle
but
that
if
i
lost
waffles
i
die
of
grief
it
was
so
of
course
but
i
to
have
waffles
gone
he
is
all
i
have
to
remember
uncle
haddon
by
and
then
to
have
him
go
i
should
take
it
a
pleasure
to
be
employed
upon
a
case
to
fetch
him
back
said
gubb
oh
would
you
cried
miss
i
so
glad
i
was
afraid
a
a
real
detective
might
not
want
to
bother
with
a
dog
of
course
pay
the
remuneration
will
be
minimum
on
account
of
the
smallness
of
the
crime
under
the
statutes
made
and
provided
said
gubb
but
you
must
let
me
pay
urged
miss
one
of
the
things
uncle
haddon
said
was
you
ever
lose
that
dog
dolly
hire
detective
gubb
understand
he
a
wonderful
detective
he
leave
no
stone
unturned
he
find
your
dog
he
pry
the
roof
off
the
to
find
a
flea
and
when
he
found
the
flea
he
hunt
up
a
blond
dog
to
match
it
remember
he
said
you
lose
the
dog
get
gubb
i
consider
the
compliment
the
highest
form
of
flattery
said
gubb
so
i
want
you
to
try
to
find
waffles
please
if
it
is
beneath
you
to
hunt
a
dog
said
miss
how
much
will
you
charge
to
find
waffles
mr
gubb
i
ought
to
have
five
dollars
gubb
began
doubtfully
of
course
exclaimed
miss
why
i
expected
to
pay
far
more
well
and
good
said
gubb
and
now
how
aged
was
the
dog
when
he
was
purloined
away
from
you
philo
gubb
secured
a
complete
history
of
the
dog
miss
had
brought
also
two
photographs
of
waffles
in
pleasing
poses
and
when
she
left
gubb
accompanied
her
to
the
late
home
of
waffles
it
was
there
he
gathered
the
clues
over
which
he
was
poring
with
his
microscope
when
higgins
came
to
ask
him
to
step
across
the
hall
and
to
offer
him
two
hundred
dollars
if
he
could
produce
mustard
bilton
gubb
went
across
the
hall
gubb
said
judge
mackinnon
when
he
had
introduced
the
detective
to
kinsey
and
doblin
was
mustard
bilton
in
this
office
when
you
signed
your
name
to
these
wills
no
sir
he
was
not
present
in
person
said
gubb
he
was
elsewhere
well
ladies
said
the
judge
it
seems
to
me
that
until
we
can
find
mustard
we
can
not
proceed
last
will
whichever
it
is
must
be
probated
if
i
took
this
will
to
the
courthouse
whichever
side
happened
to
be
uppermost
would
be
probated
first
and
the
other
side
would
naturally
appear
on
the
record
as
the
latest
will
it
is
a
responsibility
i
do
not
care
to
undertake
if
you
will
not
agree
to
compromise
and
divide
the
estate
never
said
both
ladies
we
must
find
mustard
said
the
judge
gubb
went
into
the
hall
but
lawyer
burch
followed
him
gubb
he
said
just
a
word
find
mustard
for
me
now
talk
find
him
bring
mustard
to
judge
mackinnon
office
and
i
put
two
hundred
dollars
in
your
hand
that
all
detective
gubb
returned
to
his
office
and
resumed
his
work
on
his
lost
dog
clues
one
by
one
he
submitted
the
clues
to
inspection
under
the
microscope
he
tried
the
five
processes
of
the
sherlock
holmes
inductive
method
on
them
by
some
strange
quirk
quite
out
of
keeping
with
the
usual
logic
he
could
make
nothing
of
them
even
the
flea
in
the
bit
of
dog
hair
did
not
point
direct
to
the
location
of
the
dog
they
were
blind
clues
gubb
swept
them
into
an
empty
envelope
sealed
the
envelope
put
on
his
hat
and
went
out
on
the
stair
he
met
judge
mackinnon
well
if
meant
to
have
a
little
joke
and
he
did
he
had
it
said
the
judge
with
a
chuckle
you
should
have
been
in
that
room
just
now
cat
fights
those
two
women
all
but
jumped
on
each
other
with
claws
and
teeth
i
do
know
why
wanted
to
worry
them
but
he
has
paid
them
back
well
for
whatever
they
ever
did
to
him
and
the
dog
has
disappeared
away
too
said
gubb
i
am
proceeding
on
my
way
at
the
present
time
to
help
discover
where
the
dog
is
hope
you
find
the
poor
child
pet
said
the
judge
as
he
turned
off
in
the
opposite
direction
gubb
proceeded
to
the
late
home
of
haddon
he
followed
the
brick
walk
to
the
back
of
the
house
he
was
already
familiar
with
the
premises
the
the
only
recently
painted
structure
in
the
neighborhood
stood
opposite
the
kitchen
door
it
was
perhaps
three
feet
in
height
and
four
feet
long
with
a
pointed
roof
as
a
door
it
had
an
open
arch
and
at
one
side
of
this
was
a
staple
to
which
a
chain
could
be
attached
the
grass
in
front
of
the
was
worn
away
leaving
the
soil
packed
hard
the
detective
arriving
at
the
walked
around
it
gazing
at
it
closely
the
inductive
method
had
failed
as
it
always
failed
for
gubb
and
he
meant
now
to
try
following
a
clue
in
person
if
he
could
find
a
clue
to
follow
gubb
dropped
to
his
hands
and
knees
and
crept
around
the
seeking
a
clue
hidden
in
the
grass
when
he
reached
the
front
of
the
he
paused
ye
look
that
like
a
dog
i
was
thinkin
ye
howl
for
a
bone
said
mullarky
suddenly
from
the
kitchen
door
gubb
turned
and
eyed
her
with
disapproval
the
operations
of
deteckating
are
strange
to
the
lay
mind
he
said
haughtily
those
not
understanding
them
should
be
seen
and
not
heard
an
hear
the
man
cried
mullarky
does
a
drive
all
of
ye
crazy
t
see
a
human
bein
crawlin
around
on
his
four
legs
callin

awn
if
ye
wish
crawl
inside
of

i
going

so
said
gubb
and
he
did
inside
or
as
far
inside
as
he
could
get
gubb
struck
a
match
and
examined
the
floor
of
the
house
there
was
straw
on
it
but
nothing
even
remotely
suggesting
a
clue
no
dog
thief
had
left
a
glove
there
gubb
began
to
back
out
and
as
he
backed
his
head
touched
something
softer
than
a
pine
board
he
craned
his
long
neck
and
looked
upward
tacked
to
the
inside
of
the
roof
of
the
house
was
a
long
envelope
gubb
put
up
his
hand
and
pulled
it
loose
then
he
backed
into
the
daylight
he
sat
on
the
bare
spot
before
the
and
examined
the
envelope
the
envelope
was
sealed
but
on
the
face
of
it
was
written
to
be
delivered
to
judge
mackinnon
after
waffles
has
been
returned
to
his
house
and
home
waffles
will
be
found
in
the
old
on
the
illinois
side
of
the
river
north
from
the
turnpike
at
the
far
end
of
the
bridge
it
was
a
clue
without
stopping
to
silence
the
scornful
laughter
of
mullarky
philo
gubb
jumped
to
his
feet
and
made
for
the
illinois
side
of
the
long
bridge
as
rapidly
as
his
long
legs
could
carry
him
he
reached
the
old
and
there
he
found
mustard
bilton
seated
at
the
door
smoking
a
cob
pipe
in
lazy
comfort
come

he
says
you
gubb
would
want
to
see
what

inside
the
empty
can
before
he
start
out
to

the
feller

sit
quiet
an
wait
till

snoops
round
enough
he
says

energetically
mustard
took

looked

glancing
at
the
doblin

time

he
gubb
said
judge
mackinnon
suddenly
would
you
be
betraying
a
professional
secret
if
you
told
us
how
you
found
this
document
in
the
pursuit
of
following
my
deteckative
profession
said
detective
gubb
according
to
lesson
six
page
the
anonymous
wiggle
any
one
reading
a
history
of
the
detective
work
of
philo
gubb
the
detective
might
imagine
that
crime
stalked
abroad
endlessly
in
riverbank
and
that
criminals
crowded
the
streets
but
this
would
be
mere
imagination
for
weeks
before
he
took
on
the
case
of
the
anonymous
wiggle
he
had
been
obliged
to
revert
to
his
of
and
decorating
four
hundred
of
the
dollars
he
had
earned
by
solving
the
mystery
of
the
missing
mustard
and
waffles
he
had
paid
to
medderbrook
together
with
five
dollars
for
a
telegram
medderbrook
had
received
from
syrilla
this
telegram
was
a
great
satisfaction
to
gubb
it
brought
the
day
when
she
might
be
his
nearer
and
showed
that
the
fair
creature
was
fighting
nobly
to
reduce
it

love
to
gubby
from

syrilla
crime
is
not
rampant
in
riverbank
gubb
therefore
welcomed
gladly
miss
petunia
scroggs
when
she
came
to
his
office
in
the
opera
house
block
and
said
gubb
philo
gubb
the
detective
well
my
name
is
miss
petunia
scroggs
and
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
detecting
something
for
me
i
pleased
to
said
gubb
placing
a
chair
for
the
lady
anything
in
the
deteckative
line
which
i
can
do
for
you
will
be
so
done
gladly
and
in
good
shape
at
the
present
moment
of
time
engaged
upon
a
job
of
kitchen
paper
for
horton
up
on
eleventh
street
but
the
same
will
not
occupy
long
as
she
wants
it
hung
over
what
is
already
on
the
wall
to
minimize
the
cost
of
the
expense
different
people
different
ways
said
miss
scroggs
smiling
sweetly
scrape
it
off
and
be
clean
is
my
idea
yes
said
philo
gubb
well
i
did
come
here
to
talk
about
horton
notion
of
how
a
kitchen
ought
to
be
papered
said
miss
scroggs
how
do
you
detect
by
the
day
or
by
the
job
my
terms
in
such
matters
is
various
and
sundry
to
suit
the
taste
said
gubb
then
i
hire
you
by
the
job
said
miss
scroggs
if
your
rates
ai
too
high
now
first
off
i
ai
ever
been
married
i
a
maiden
lady
yes
said
philo
gubb
jotting
this
down
on
a
sheet
of
paper
not
but
what
i
could
have
been
a
wedded
wife
many
the
time
said
miss
scroggs
hastily
but
i
says
to
myself
of
mind
petunia
peace
of
mind
yes
said
philo
gubb
i
a
unmarried
bachelor
man
myself
well
i
surprised
to
hear
you
say
it
in
a
boasting
tone
said
miss
petunia
gently
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
it
yes
said
philo
gubb
but
you
was
conversationally
speaking
of
some
deteckative
work
and
i
leading
right
up
to
it
all
the
time
said
miss
scroggs
peace
of
mind
is
why
i
have
remained
single
up
to
now
and
peace
of
mind
i
have
had
but
i
wo
have
it
much
longer
if
this
anonymous
wiggle
keeps
on
writing
me
letters
somebody
named
with
that
cognomen
is
writing
letters
to
you
like
a
black
hand
would
asked
gubb
eagerly
cognomen
or
not
said
miss
scroggs
that
what
i
call
him
or
her
or
whoever
it
is
snake
would
be
a
better
name
she
added
but
i
must
say
the
thing
looks
more
like
a
now
here
she
said
opening
her
black
is
letter
number
one
read
it
gubb
took
the
envelope
and
looked
at
the
address
it
was
written
in
a
hand
evidently
disguised
by
slanting
the
letters
backward
and
had
been
mailed
at
the
riverbank
hum
said
gubb
lesson
nine
of
the
rising
sun
deteckative
agency
correspondence
school
of
deteckating
gives
the
full
rules
and
regulations
for
to
elucidate
the
mystery
of
threatening
letters
scurrilous
letters
et
cetery
now
is
this
a
threatening
letter
or
a
scurrilous
letter
well
it
may
be
threatening
and
it
may
not
be
threatening
said
miss
scroggs
if
it
is
a
threat
i
must
say
i
never
heard
of
a
threat
just
like
it
and
if
it
is
scurrilous
i
must
say
i
never
heard
of
anything
that
scurriled
in
the
words
used
read
it
philo
gubb
pulled
the
letter
from
the
envelope
and
read
it
it
ran
thus
petunia
open
any
book
at
page
fourteen
and
read
the
first
complete
sentence
at
the
top
of
the
page
go
thou
and
do
likewise
for
signature
there
was
nothing
but
a
waved
line
drawn
with
a
pen
in
some
respects
it
did
resemble
an
philo
gubb
frowned
the
advice
of
the
inditer
that
wrote
this
letter
seemingly
appears
to
be
sort
of
unexact
he
said
every
book
is
apt
to
have
a
different
lot
of
words
at
the
top
of
page
fourteen
just
so
said
miss
scroggs
you
may
well
say
that
and
say
it
to
myself
i
did
until
i
started
to
open
a
book
i
went
to
the
and
i
took
down
my
bible
and
i
turned
to
page
fourteen
as
the
writer
beyond
no
doubt
thought
you
would
said
gubb
i
do
know
what
he
thought
said
miss
scroggs
but
when
i
opened
my
bible
and
turned
to
page
fourteen
there
was
any
page
fourteen
in
it
page
fourteen
is
part
of
the
foreword
from
the
translators
to
the
reader
so
i
thought
maybe
it
had
got
lost
and
never
been
missed
so
i
took
up
another
book
i
took
up
emerson
essays
volume
two
and
what
did
you
read
asked
philo
gubb
nothing
said
miss
scroggs
because
i
could
page
fourteen
was
tore
out
of
the
book
so
i
went
through
all
my
books
and
every
page
fourteen
was
tore
out
of
every
book
there
was
only
one
book
in
the
house
that
had
a
page
fourteen
left
in
it
and
what
did
that
say
asked
gubb
it
said
said
miss
petunia
one
quart
of
flour
add
a
cup
of
water
beat
well
and
add
the
beaten
whites
of
two
eggs
did
you
do
all
that
inquired
gubb
well
said
miss
petunia
i
did
see
any
harm
in
trying
it
just
to
see
what
happened
so
i
did
it
and
what
happened
asked
gubb
nothing
said
miss
petunia
in
a
couple
of
days
the
water
dried
up
and
the
dough
got
pasty
and
moulded
and
i
threw
it
out
just
so
said
philo
gubb
you
sort
of
expect
it
to
get
mouldy
but
you
would
call
it
threatening
at
the
first
look
no
said
miss
petunia
and
then
i
got
this
letter
number
two
she
handed
the
second
letter
to
gubb
it
ran
thus
scroggs
a
complete
study
of
the
history
and
antiquities
of
diocese
of
ossory
fails
to
reveal
the
presence
of
a
single
individual
bearing
the
name
of
scroggs
from
the
year
to
date
like
the
first
letter
this
was
signed
with
a
waved
line
gubb
studied
it
carefully
i
do
see
no
sign
of
a
threat
in
that
he
said
not
unless
you
should
say
it
was
belittling
me
to
tell
me
to
my
face
that
no
scroggs
ever
lived
wherever
that
says
they
did
live
said
miss
petunia
now
here
the
next
letter
gubb
read
it
it
ran
thus
miss
petunia
for
rising
temperature
accompanied
by
falling
barometer
followed
by
heavy
showers
lower
temperature
will
follow
in
the
north
central
states
and
northern
missouri
i
should
call
that
exactly
scurrilous
neither
said
gubb
it
ai
said
miss
petunia
and
unless
you
can
call
a
mention
of
threatening
weather
a
threat
i
would
call
it
a
threatening
letter
and
then
i
got
this
letter
she
handed
gubb
the
fourth
letter
and
he
read
it
it
ran
petunia
scroggs
trout
are
rising
freely
in
the
maine
waters
the
parmacheene
belle
is
one
of
the
best
flies
to
use
gubb
having
read
this
letter
shook
his
head
and
placed
the
letter
on
top
of
those
he
had
previously
read
it
was
signed
with
the
wiggle
like
the
others
speaking
as
a
deteckative
he
said
i
do
see
anything
into
these
letters
yet
that
would
fetch
the
writer
into
the
grasp
of
the
law
are
they
all
like
this
if
you
mean
do
they
say
they
are
going
to
murder
me
or
do
they
call
me
names
said
miss
scroggs
they
do
here
take
them
gubb
took
the
remaining
letters
and
read
them
there
were
about
a
dozen
of
them
while
peculiar
epistles
to
write
to
a
maiden
lady
of
years
they
were
not
what
one
might
call
violent
they
were
in
part
as
follows

a

swedish
iron
is
largely
used
in
the
manufacture
of
upholstery
tacks
because
of
its
peculiar
ductile
qualities
i
do
see
nothing
much
into
them
said
gubb
when
he
had
read
them
all
i
do
see
much
of
a
deteckative
case
into
them
if
i
was
to
get
letters
like
these
i
would
worry
much
about
them
i
let
them
come
you
may
say
that
said
miss
petunia
because
you
are
a
man
and
big
and
strong
and
but
when
a
person
is
a
woman
and
lives
alone
and
has
some
money
laid
by
that
some
folks
would
be
glad
enough
to
get
letters
coming
right
along
from
she
do
know
who
scare
her
every
time
i
get
another
of
those
anonymous
wiggle
letters
i
get
more
and
more
nervous
if
they
said
me
five
thousand
dollars
or
i
will
kill
you
i
would
know
what
to
do
but
when
a
letter
comes
that
says
like
that
one
does
iron
is
largely
used
in
the
manufacture
of
upholstery
tacks
i
do
know
what
to
think
or
what
to
do
i
can
see
to
understand
that
it
might
worry
you
some
said
gubb
sympathetically
what
do
you
want
i
should
do
i
want
you
should
find
out
who
wrote
the
letters
said
miss
scroggs
gubb
looked
at
the
pile
of
letters
it
going
to
be
a
hard
job
he
said
i
got
to
try
to
guess
out
a
cryptogram
in
these
letters
i
ought
to
have
a
hundred
dollars
it
a
good
deal
but
i
pay
it
said
miss
petunia
i
ai
rich
but
i
got
quite
a
little
money
in
the
bank
and
i
own
the
house
i
live
in
and
a
farm
i
rent
pa
left
me
money
and
property
worth
about
ten
thousand
dollars
and
i
have
wasted
it
so
go
ahead
illustration
you
are
a
man
and
big
and
strong
and
i
so
do
said
philo
gubb
and
first
off
i
ask
you
who
your
neighbors
are
my
neighbors
exclaimed
miss
petunia
on
both
sides
said
gubb
and
who
comes
to
your
house
most
well
i
declare
said
miss
petunia
i
do
know
what
you
are
getting
at
but
on
one
side
i
have
no
neighbors
at
all
and
on
the
other
side
is
canterby
i
guess
she
comes
to
my
house
oftener
than
anybody
else
i
am
acquainted
with
canterby
said
gubb
i
did
a
job
of
there
only
last
week
did
you
indeed
said
miss
scroggs
politely
she
a
real
nice
lady
i
do
give
opinions
on
deteckative
matters
until
i
sure
said
gubb
she
seems
nice
enough
to
the
naked
eye
i
do
want
to
get
you
to
suspicion
her
or
nobody
miss
scroggs
but
about
the
only
clue
i
can
grab
hold
of
is
that
first
letter
you
got
it
said
to
look
on
page
fourteen
and
all
the
pages
by
that
number
was
torn
out
of
your
books
except
my
said
miss
petunia
and
a
person
naturally
would
go
to
think
of
a
as
a
real
book
said
gubb
if
you
stop
to
think
you
see
that
whoever
wrote
that
letter
must
have
beforehand
tore
out
all
the
page
fourteens
from
the
books
into
your
house
for
some
reason
why
yes
exclaimed
miss
scroggs
clapping
her
hands
together
how
wise
you
are
deteckative
work
fetches
deteckative
wisdom
said
gubb
modestly
i
do
want
to
throw
suspicion
at
canterby
but
letter
number
one
points
at
her
first
of
all
o
h
yes
o
h
my
and
i
never
even
thought
of
that
cried
miss
petunia
admiringly
us
deteckatives
have
to
think
of
things
said
philo
gubb
and
so
we
will
say
just
for
cod
like
that
canterby
got
at
your
books
and
ripped
out
the
pages
she
think
will
miss
petunia
do
when
she
finds
she
has
any
page
fourteens
to
look
at
she
rush
out
to
borrow
a
book
to
look
at
now
where
would
you
rush
out
to
borrow
a
book
if
you
wanted
to
borrow
one
in
a
hurry
to
canterby
house
exclaimed
miss
petunia
just
so
said
gubb
you
rush
over
and
you
say
canterby
lend
me
a
book
and
she
would
hand
you
a
book
and
when
you
looked
at
page
fourteen
and
read
the
first
full
sentence
on
the
page
what
would
you
read
what
would
i
read
asked
miss
scroggs
breathlessly
you
would
read
what
she
meant
you
to
read
said
gubb
triumphantly
so
then
what
if
i
was
in
her
place
and
i
had
written
a
letter
to
you
meaning
to
give
you
a
threat
in
a
roundabout
way
and
it
went
dead
i
write
some
foolish
letters
to
you
to
make
you
think
the
whole
thing
was
just
foolishness
i
write
you
letters
about
weather
and
tacks
and
cats
and
lime
and
trout
and
such
things
to
throw
you
off
the
scent
maybe
said
gubb
with
a
smile
just
copy
bits
out
of
a
newspaper
how
wonderfully
wonderful
exclaimed
miss
petunia
that
is
what
us
deteckatives
spend
the
midnight
oil
learning
the
rising
sun
deteckative
agency
correspondence
school
lessons
for
said
gubb
so
if
my
theory
is
right
what
you
want
to
do
when
you
get
back
home
is
to
rush
over
to
canterby
and
ask
to
borrow
a
book
and
look
on
page
fourteen
and
then
come
back
and
tell
you
what
it
says
asked
miss
petunia
just
so
said
philo
gubb
miss
petunia
arose
with
a
simper
and
gubb
arose
to
open
the
door
for
her
he
felt
particularly
gracious
never
in
his
career
had
he
been
able
to
apply
the
inductive
system
before
and
he
was
well
pleased
with
himself
his
somewhat
melancholy
eyes
almost
beamed
on
miss
petunia
and
he
felt
a
warm
glow
in
his
heart
for
the
poor
little
thing
who
had
come
to
him
in
her
trouble
as
he
stood
waiting
for
miss
scroggs
to
gather
up
her
feather
boa
and
her
parasol
and
her
black
he
felt
the
dangerous
pity
of
the
strong
for
the
weak
miss
petunia
held
out
her
hand
with
a
pretty
gesture
she
was
fully
but
she
was
kittenish
for
her
age
there
was
something
almost
girlish
in
her
manner
and
the
long
dancing
brown
curls
that
hung
below
her
very
youthful
hat
added
to
the
effect
when
she
had
shaken
gubb
hand
she
out
of
his
office
an
admirable
creature
said
gubb
to
himself
and
he
turned
to
his
microscope
and
began
to
study
the
ink
of
the
letters
under
that
instrument
his
next
work
must
be
to
find
the
identical
ink
and
the
identical
he
had
no
doubt
he
would
find
them
in
canterby
home
the
ink
was
a
pale
blue
in
places
deepening
to
a
strong
blue
in
other
places
with
grainy
blue
specks
he
decided
rightly
that
this
ink
had
been
made
of
laundry
blue
the
paper
was
plain
glossy
of
surface
and
with
blue
lines
and
in
the
upper
left
corner
the
maker
impress
this
was
composed
of
three
feathers
with
the
word
excellent
beneath
the
envelopes
were
of
the
proper
size
to
receive
the
letters
they
bore
an
unmistakable
odor
of
toilet
soap
and
dusenberry
said
gubb
and
smiled
hod
dusenberry
kept
a
small
store
near
the
home
of
canterby
there
seemed
no
doubt
that
the
coils
of
the
investigation
were
tightening
around
canterby
and
gubb
put
on
his
hat
and
went
out
he
went
to
hod
dusenberry
store
dusenberry
sat
behind
the
counter
i
came
in
said
gubb
to
purchase
a
bottle
of
ink
off
of
you
there
now
said
dusenberry
that
the
third
call
for
ink
i
had
in
two
months
i
been
meanin
to
lay
in
more
ink
right
along
and
it
allus
slips
my
mind
i
told
miss
scroggs
when
she
asked
for
ink
and
what
did
you
tell
canterby
when
she
asked
for
ink
asked
gubb
mrs
canterby
said
hod
dusenberry
maybe
i
ought
to
see
the
joke
but
i
feelin
stupid
i
reckon
what
the
laugh
part
it
was
my
intentional
aim
to
furnish
laughable
amusement
said
detective
gubb
seriously
what
did
canterby
say
when
she
asked
for
ink
and
you
did
have
none
she
did
say
nothin
said
dusenberry
because
she
never
asked
me
for
no
ink
never
she
do
trade
here
that
all
about
mrs
canterby
the
correspondence
school
detective
had
been
leaning
on
the
and
with
the
shrewdness
of
his
kind
had
let
his
eyes
search
its
contents
in
the
was
of
the
very
sort
the
anonymous
wiggle
letters
had
been
written
on
also
envelopes
strangely
similar
to
those
that
had
held
the
letters
gubb
smiled
pleasantly
at
dusenberry
i
make
a
guess
that
canterby
do
buy
her
off
you
neither
he
hazarded
you
guess
mighty
right
she
do
said
dusenberry
and
maybe
you
do
recall
who
ever
bought
like
this
into
the
case
here
said
gubb
i
guess
maybe
i
do
just
the
same
said
dusenberry
promptly
and
it
ai
hard
to
recall
either
because
nobody
buys
it
but
miss
scroggs
is
the
female
i
ever
did
see
crazy
after
a
husband
is
he
chuckled
if
i
was
married
already
i
dare
say
would
have
worried
me
into
matrimony
before
now
trouble
is
that
everybody
knows
her
too
well
men
all
keep
out
of
her
way
but
she
a
dandy
is
they
tell
me
that
when
hinterman
the
plumber
hired
a
new
man
up
to
derlingport
and
found
out
he
was
a
single
feller
she
went
to
work
and
had
new
plumbing
put
in
her
house
just
so
the
feller
would
have
to
come
within
her
reach
but
he
got
away
he
did
said
gubb
nervously
oh
yes
said
dusenberry
he
stood
as
long
as
he
could
and
then
he
threw
up
his
job
and
went
back
to
derlingport
they
tell
me
she
do
do
nothin
much
now
but
set
around
the
house
and
think
up
new
ways
to
git
acquainted
with
men
that
ai
heard
enough
of
her
to
stay
shy
of
her
sorry
i
ai
got
no
ink
mr
gubb
it
a
matter
of
no
consequential
importance
thank
you
said
gubb
and
he
went
out
he
was
distinctly
troubled
he
recalled
now
that
miss
scroggs
had
smiled
in
a
winning
way
when
she
spoke
to
him
and
that
she
had
quite
warmly
pressed
his
hand
when
she
departed
with
a
timid
bachelor
extreme
fear
of
designing
women
gubb
dreaded
another
meeting
with
miss
scroggs
only
his
faithfulness
to
his
correspondence
school
diploma
had
power
to
keep
him
at
work
on
the
anonymous
wiggle
case
and
he
walked
thoughtfully
toward
the
home
of
canterby
he
went
to
the
back
door
and
knocked
gently
canterby
came
to
the
door
said
gubb
i
been
a
little
nervous
about
that
paper
i
hung
onto
your
walls
if
i
could
take
a
look
at
it
well
now
gubb
that
real
kind
of
you
said
canterby
you
can
look
and
welcome
if
you
just
wait
until
i
excuse
myself
to
miss
scroggs
is
she
here
asked
gubb
with
a
hasty
glance
toward
his
avenues
of
escape
she
just
run
in
to
borrow
a
book
to
read
said
canterby
and
she
having
some
trouble
finding
one
to
suit
her
taste
she
in
my
sort
of
glancing
through
some
books
does
does
she
glance
through
to
about
near
to
page
fourteen
asked
gubb
nervously
now
that
you
call
it
to
mind
said
canterby
that
about
how
far
she
is
glancing
through
them
she
glanced
through
about
sixteen
and
she
still
glancing
she
thinks
maybe
she
take
lover
or
the
hidden
secret
but
she
ai
sure
she
come
over
to
borrow
shirmer
but
i
had
lent
that
to
a
friend
she
was
real
disappointed
i
did
have
it
gubb
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
face
he
too
would
have
liked
at
that
moment
to
have
seen
a
copy
of
weldon
shirmer
and
to
have
read
what
stood
at
the
top
of
page
fourteen
if
it
ai
too
much
trouble
canterby
he
said
i
wish
you
would
sort
of
fetch
that
myra
book
out
here
without
miss
knowing
you
done
so
i
got
a
special
reason
for
it
in
my
deteckative
capacity
and
i
wish
you
would
mention
to
miss
scroggs
about
my
being
here
land
sakes
said
canterby
what
up
now
miss
scroggs
right
interested
in
you
too
she
made
inquiries
of
me
about
you
when
you
was
working
here
she
says
she
thinks
you
are
a
real
handsome
gentleman
canterby
laughed
coyly
and
went
out
and
gubb
dropped
into
a
chair
and
wiped
his
face
again
nervously
his
eye
falling
on
the
kitchen
table
noted
a
sheet
of
it
was
the
same
style
of
paper
as
that
on
which
the
anonymous
wiggle
letters
had
been
written
he
bent
forward
and
glanced
at
it
in
blue
ink
evidently
made
of
indigo
dissolved
in
water
was
written
on
the
sheet
a
recipe
the
writing
although
undisguised
and
slanting
properly
was
beyond
doubt
the
same
as
that
of
the
wiggle
letters
when
canterby
returned
to
the
kitchen
with
myra
lover
hidden
in
the
folds
of
her
skirt
the
perplexed
gubb
held
the
recipe
in
his
hand
by
any
chance
of
doubt
he
said
do
you
happen
to
be
aware
of
whom
wrote
this
petunia
wrote
it
said
canterby
promptly
and
whatever
are
you
being
so
mysterious
for
there
no
mystery
about
that
for
it
her
recipe
there
is
often
mystery
hidden
into
recipes
when
least
expected
said
gubb
i
see
you
got
the
book
he
took
it
and
turned
to
page
fourteen
at
the
top
of
the
page
were
the
words
completing
a
sentence
without
turning
a
hair
of
his
head
then
followed
the
first
complete
sentence
it
ran
woman
like
you
said
lord
cyril
be
loved
cherished
and
obeyed
goodness
exclaimed
gubb
and
handed
the
book
back
to
canterby
why
did
you
say
that
asked
canterby
i
was
just
judging
by
the
book
that
miss
scroggs
is
fond
of
love
and
affection
in
fiction
tales
he
said
fond
of
exclaimed
canterby
far
be
it
from
me
to
say
anything
about
a
neighbor
lady
but
if
petunia
scroggs
ai
crazy
over
love
and
marriage
i
do
know
what
she
do
anything
in
the
world
to
get
a
husband
i
recall
about
tim
wentworth
furnaces
put
in
and
repaired
and
how
hungry
petunia
used
to
look
after
him
when
he
went
by
in
his
wagon
but
she
could
get
after
him
because
she
has
a
furnace
in
her
house
but
the
minute
he
hung
up
the
sign
cleaned
she
was
down
to
his
shop
and
had
him
up
to
the
place
and
i
know
it
for
a
fact
for
i
took
some
of
the
soot
out
of
her
eye
myself
that
she
courted
him
so
hard
when
he
got
to
her
house
that
even
when
he
went
to
the
roof
to
clean
the
chimney
she
stuck
her
head
in
the
fireplace
and
talked
up
the
flue
at
him
goodness
said
gubb
again
i
guess
i
go
on
my
way
and
look
at
your
some
other
day
canterby
laughed
just
as
you
wish
she
said
but
if
petunia
has
set
out
after
you
you
wo
get
away
from
her
that
easy
but
gubb
was
already
moving
to
the
door
he
heard
miss
voice
calling
canterby
and
coming
nearer
and
nearer
and
he
fled
at
higgins
he
stopped
and
asked
to
see
a
copy
of
weldon
shirmer
and
turned
to
page
fourteen
ran
the
first
full
sentence
decreed
that
you
wed
a
solver
of
mysteries
gubb
shivered
this
was
the
mysterious
passage
miss
scroggs
had
meant
to
bring
to
his
eyes
in
an
impressive
manner
he
was
sure
of
one
thing
whatever
fate
had
decreed
in
the
case
of
the
heroine
of
weldon
shirmer
philo
gubb
had
no
intention
of
allowing
fate
to
decree
that
one
particular
correspondence
school
solver
of
mysteries
should
marry
miss
petunia
scroggs
he
hurried
to
his
office
at
the
office
door
he
paused
to
take
his
key
from
his
pocket
but
when
he
tried
it
in
the
lock
he
found
the
door
had
been
left
unlocked
and
he
opened
the
door
hastily
and
hurried
inside
miss
petunia
scroggs
was
sitting
in
his
a
winning
smile
on
her
lips
and
lover
or
the
hidden
secret
in
her
lap
dear
wonderful
mr
gubb
she
said
sweetly
it
was
just
as
you
said
it
would
be
here
is
the
book
canterby
loaned
me
for
a
moment
gubb
stood
like
a
flamingo
fascinated
by
a
serpent
you
detectives
are
such
wonderful
men
cooed
miss
petunia
you
live
such
thrilling
lives
ah
me
she
sighed
when
i
think
of
how
noble
and
how
strong
and
how
protective
such
as
you
are
gubb
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
miss
petunia
face
but
he
pawed
behind
himself
for
the
door
he
felt
his
hand
touch
the
knob
and
when
i
think
of
how
helpless
and
alone
i
am
said
miss
petunia
rising
from
her
chair
although
i
have
ample
money
in
the
bank
slammed
the
door
behind
gubb
went
the
lock
as
he
turned
the
key
his
feet
hurried
to
the
stairs
and
down
to
the
nearest
street
almost
falling
over
silas
washington
seated
on
the
lowest
step
the
little
negro
looked
up
in
surprise
do
you
want
to
earn
half
a
dollar
asked

his

and
he
glanced

down
the
street
and
say

bit
of
difference

the
lady

of
his
life
yassah
said
the
little
negro
the
half
of
a
thousand
philo
gubb
sat
in
his
office
in
the
opera
house
block
with
a
large
green
volume
open
on
his
knees
reading
a
paragraph
of
some
ten
lines
he
had
read
this
paragraph
twenty
times
before
but
he
never
tired
of
reading
it
it

he
hoped
that
some
day
this
short
record
of
his
life
might
be
lengthened
by
at
least
one
line
which
would
say
that
he
had
syrilla
medderbrook
and
since
his
escape
from
petunia
scroggs
and
her
wiles
and
the
latest
telegram
from
syrilla
he
had
reason
for
the
hope
as
gubb
had
not
tried
to
collect
the
one
hundred
dollars
due
him
from
miss
scroggs
he
had
nothing
with
which
to
pay
medderbrook
more
on
account
of
the
utterly
hopeless
mining
stock
but
under
his
agreement
with
medderbrook
he
had
paid
that
gentleman
dollars
and
fifty

for

gubb
therefore
mused
pleasantly
as
he
read
the
book
that
contained
the
short
but
interesting
reference
to
himself
the
book
with
the
green
cover
was
iowa
prominent
citizens
sixth
edition
and
was
a
sort
of
local
or
state
who
who
in
its
pages
for
the
first
time
philo
gubb
appeared
and
he
took
great
delight
in
reading
there
how
great
he
was
we
all
do
we
are
never
so
sure
we
are
great
as
when
we
read
it
in
print
it
is
always
comforting
to
a
great
man
to
be
reassured
that
he
was
dobbinsville
that
he
jane
dau
of
oscar
and
siluria
botts
and
that
he
is
not
yet
there
are
some
of
us
who
are
never
sure
we
are
not
except
when
we
see
our
names
in
the
current
volume
of
who
who
who
it
or
iowa
prominent
citizens
outside
philo
gubb
door
a
man
was
standing
studying
that
part
of
iowa
prominent
citizens
devoted
to
the
town
of
riverbank
the
man
was
not
as
young
as
he
appeared
to
be
his
garments
were
of
a
youthful
cut
and
cloth
being
of
the
sort
generally
known
as
college
youth
style
but
they
were
themselves
no
longer
youthful
in
fact
the
man
looked
seedy
notwithstanding
this
he
had
an
air
a
something
that
attracted
and
held
the
attention
a
cane
gave
some
of
it
the
extreme
good
style
of
his
panama
hat
gave
some
of
it
his
carriage
and
the
eyeglasses
with
the
black
silk
gave
still
more
when
however
he
removed
his
hat
one
saw
that
he
was
partly
bald
and
that
his
reddish
hair
was
combed
carefully
to
cover
the
bald
spot
the
book
in
his
hand
was
a
small
memorandum
book
and
in
this
he
had
pasted
the
various
notices
cut
from
iowa
prominent
citizens
and
one
only
cut
from
who
who
relating
to
citizens
of
riverbank
he
had
done
this
for
convenience
as
well
as
for
safety
for
thus
he
had
all
the
riverbank
prominents
in
compact
form
and
avoided
the
necessity
of
carrying
iowa
prominent
citizens
and
who
who
about
with
him
that
would
have
been
more
or
less
dangerous
particularly
so
since
he
had
been
exposed
by
the
new
york
sun
as
the
bald
impostor
the
bald
impostor
to
explain
him
briefly
was
a
professional
relative
he
was
the
greatest
in
the
united
states
and
always
he
was
the
son
cousin
or
nephew
of
one
of
the
great
of
one
of
the
great
mentioned
in
who
who
he
was
as
variable
as
a
chameleon
sometimes
he
was
a
son
cousin
or
nephew
of
some
one
beginning
with
and
sometimes
of
some
one
beginning
with
but
usually
of
some
one
with
about
twelve
to
fourteen
lines
in
who
the
great
theory
he
had
established
and
which
was
the
basis
of
all
his
operations
was
this
every
who
who
is
proud
of
every
other
who
and
no
who
who
can
refuse
the
son
cousin
or
nephew
of
any
other
who
who
five
dollars
when
asked
for
one
dollar
and
eighty
cents
the
bald
impostor
operation
was
simple
in
the
extreme
he
went
to
riverbank
he
found
let
us
say
the
name
of
judge
orley
morvis
in
who
who
then
he
looked
up
chief
justice
bassio
bates
in
the
latest
who
who
gathered
a
few
facts
regarding
him
from
that
useful
volume
and
called
on
judge
orley
morvis
having
a
judge
to
impose
upon
he
began
by
introducing
himself
as
the
favorite
nephew
of
chief
justice
bassio
bates
being
in
town
he
would
say
when
the
judge
was
mellowed
by
the
thought
that
a
nephew
of
bassio
bates
was
before
him
i
remembered
that
you
were
located
here
my
uncle
has
often
spoken
to
me
of
your
admirable
decision
in
the
calf
case
the
case
is
mentioned
in
who
who
the
judge
ca
help
being
pleased
to
learn
that
chief
justice
bassio
bates
approved
of
his
decision
in
the
case
my
uncle
has
often
regretted
that
you
have
never
met
says
the
bald
impostor
if
he
had
known
i
was
to
be
in
riverbank
he
would
have
sent
his
copy
of
your
work
and
torts
to
be
autographed
liens
and
torts
is
the
one
volume
written
by
judge
orley
morvis
mentioned
in
who
who
the
judge
becomes
mellower
than
ever
ah
yes
says
the
judge
tickled
and
how
is
your
uncle
may
i
ask
in
excellent
health
considering
his
age
you
know
he
is
says
the
bald
impostor
having
got
the
june
from
who
who
but
his
toe
still
bothers
him
a
man
of
his
age
you
know
such
things
heal
slowly
no
i
did
hear
of
that
says
the
judge
intensely
interested
he
is
going
to
get
some
intimate
details
oh
it
was
quite
dreadful
says
the
bald
impostor
he
dropped
a
volume
of
coke
on
littleton
on
it
last
march
no
it
was
april
because
it
was
april
he
spent
at
my
mother
all
this
is
pure
invention
and
that
is
where
the
bald
impostor
leads
all
others
even
as
he
invents
details
of
the
sore
toe
you
see
he
introduces
his
mother
she
was
taken
sick
early
in
april
he
says
and
presently
he
has
out
of
who
who
attending
to
the
chief
justice
sore
toe
and
advising
the
mother
to
try
the
denver
climate
and
the
next
thing
the
judge
knows
the
bald
impostor
is
telling
that
he
is
now
on
his
way
back
from
denver
to
chicago
so
then
it
comes
out
the
bald
impostor
sits
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
and
becomes
nervous
and
perspires
perspiring
is
a
sure
sign
a
man
is
unaccustomed
to
asking
a
loan
and
the
bald
impostor
is
entitled
to
start
the
first
school
of
free
perspiring
in
america
he
can
perspire
in
december
when
the
furnace
is
out
and
the
windows
are
open
all
his
head
pores
have
or
something
of
the
sort
he
is
as
free
with
beads
of
perspiration
as
the
early
indian
traders
were
with
beads
of
glass
he
mops
them
with
a
white
silk
handkerchief
so
he
perspires
and
out
comes
the
cruel
admission
he
needs
just
one
dollar
and
eighty
cents
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
has
stopped
at
riverbank
because
his
uncle
had
so
often
spoken
of
judge
orley
morvis
and
really
one
dollar
and
eighty
cents
would
see
him
through
nicely
but
my
dear
boy
says
the
judge
kindly
the
fare
is
six
dollars
and
your
meals
a
is
enough
insists
the
bald
impostor
i
have
enough
to
make
up
the
fare
with
added
and
i
could
ask
you
to
pay
for
my
meals
i
i
have
a
few
cents
and
can
buy
a
sandwich
my
dear
boy
says
judge
orley
morvis
of
riverbank
and
it
is
what
he
did
say
i
could
think
of
the
nephew
of
a
chief
justice
of
the
united
states
existing
for
that
length
of
time
on
a
sandwich
here
here
are
twenty
dollars
take
them
i
insist
i
must
insist
some
give
him
more
than
that
we
usually
give
him
five
dollars
illustration
he
perspires
and
out
comes
the
cruel
admission
i
admit
that
when
the
bald
impostor
visited
me
and
asked
for
one
dollar
and
eighty
cents
i
gave
him
five
dollars
and
an
autographed
copy
of
one
of
my
books
he
was
to
send
the
five
back
by
the
next
day
unfortunately
he
seems
to
have
no
idea
of
the
flight
of
time
for
him
never
seems
to
arrive
for
me
it
is
the
five
that
does
not
arrive
the
great
body
of
us
consider
those
who
give
him
more
than
five
to
be
plutocrats
but
then
we
sometimes
give
him
autographed
copies
of
our
books
or
other
touching
souvenirs
and
write
in
them
memory
of
a
pleasant
i
wonder
what
he
did
with
my
book
judge
orley
morvis
was
the
only
who
whoer
in
riverbank
but
the
town
was
well
represented
in
iowa
prominent
citizens
and
after
collecting
twenty
dollars
from
the
judge
the
bald
impostor
proceeded
to
gubb
office
detective
and
decorator
he
said
to
himself
i
wonder
if
william
burns
has
a
son
better
not
a
crank
detective
might
know
all
about
burns
i
his
cousin
let
me
see
i
jared
burns
of
chicago
and
mother
has
been
to
denver
for
the
air
he
took
out
the
memorandum
book
again
the
case
the
case
waffles
mustard
i
must
remember
that
he
knocked
on
the
door
mr
gubb
he
asked
as
philo
gubb
opened
the
door
philo
gubb
i
am
him
yes
sir
said
the
detective
will
you
step
inside
into
the
room
thank
you
yes
said
the
bald
impostor
as
he
entered
philo
gubb
drew
a
chair
to
his
desk
and
the
bald
impostor
took
it
he
leaned
forward
ready
to
begin
with
the
words
gubb
my
name
is
jared
burns
william
burns
is
my
cousin
when
there
came
another
rap
at
the
door
gubb
visitor
moved
uneasily
in
his
chair
and
gubb
went
to
the
door
dropping
an
open
letter
carelessly
on
the
before
the
bald
impostor
the
new
visitor
was
an
italian
selling
oranges
and
as
gubb
had
fairly
to
push
the
italian
out
of
the
door
the
bald
impostor
had
time
to
read
the
letter
and
quite
a
little
ahead
of
time
began
wiping
perspiration
from
his
forehead
the
letter
was
from
the
headquarters
of
the
rising
sun
detective
agency
and
was
brutally
frank
in
denouncing
the
bald
impostor
as
an
impostor
and
painfully
plain
in
describing
him
as
bald
it
described
in
the
simplest
terms
his
mode
of
getting
money
and
it
warned
gubb
to
be
on
the
outlook
for
him
as
he
is
supposed
to
be
working
in
your
district
at
present
the
bald
impostor
gasped
a
number
of
victims
have
organized
continued
the
letter
what
they
call
the
easy
association
of
america
and
have
posted
a
reward
of
fifty
dollars
for
the
arrest
of
the
fraud
the
bald
impostor
glanced
toward
philo
gubb
and
hastily
turned
the
letter
upside
down
when
gubb
returned
the
bald
impostor
was
rubbing
the
palms
of
his
hands
together
and
smiling
my
name
gubb
he
said
is
allwood
burns
i
am
a
detective
i
have
heard
of
your
wonderful
work
in
the
case
said
gubb
i
should
say
waffles
said
the
bald
impostor
hastily
i
consider
it
one
of
the
most
remarkable
cases
of
detective
acumen
on
record
we
in
the
rising
sun
detective
agency
were
delighted
it
was
a
proof
that
the
methods
of
our
correspondence
school
of
detecting
were
not
short
of
the
best
philo
gubb
stared
at
his
visitor
with
unconcealed
admiration
are
you
out
from
the
rising
sun
deteckative
agency
yourself
he
asked
the
bald
impostor
smiled
i
wrote
you
a
letter
yesterday
he
said
if
you
have
not
received
it
yet
you
will
soon
but
i
can
give
you
the
contents
here
and
now
a
certain
impostor
is
going
about
the
country
philo
gubb
picked
up
the
letter
and
glanced
at
the
signature
it
was
indeed
signed
allwood
burns
gubb
extended
his
hand
again
and
once
more
shook
the
hand
of
his
visitor
this
time
far
more
heartily
most
glad
indeed
to
meet
your
acquaintance
burns
said
philo
gubb
heartily
it
is
a
pleasure
to
meet
anybody
from
the
offices
of
the
rising
sun
deteckative
agency
and
if
you
ever
see
the
man
that
wrote
the
correspondence
course
of
deteckating
i
wish
the
false
burns
smiled
i
wrote
it
he
said
modestly
i
am
very
glad
to
meet
you
sir
exclaimed
philo
gubb
and
again
he
shook
his
visitor
hand
because
ah
yes
because
queried
the
bald
impostor
pleasantly
because
said
philo
gubb
there
a
question
i
want
to
ask
i
refer
to
lesson
seven
thievery
detecting
same
charges
therefor

have
had
some
trouble
with
therefor
indeed
let
me
see
the
lesson

said
the
bald
impostor
charges
for
such
services
philo
gubb
read
pointing
to
the
paragraph
with
his
long
forefinger
be
not
less
than
ten
dollars
per
diem
that
what
it
says
ai
it
it
does
said
the
bald
impostor
well
burns
said
philo
gubb
i
took
on
a
job
of
detecting
and
i
had
to
detect
for
two
diems
to
do
it
and
that
would
be
twenty
dollars
would
it
it
would
said
the
bald
impostor
which
is
fair
and
proper
said
philo
gubb
but
the
old
gent
would
pay
it
so
i
ask
you
if
you
be
kindly
willing
to
go
to
him
along
with
me
in
company
and
tell
him
i
charged
right
and
according
to
rates
as
low
as
possible
of
course
i
will
go
said
the
bald
impostor
all
right
said
philo
gubb
rising
and
the
old
gent
is
a
man
you
be
glad
to
meet
he
a
prominent
citizen
gentleman
of
the
town
his
name
is
judge
orley
morvis
the
bald
impostor
gasped
every
pore
on
his
head
worked
immediately
and
so
he
wo
suspicion
that
i
running
in
some
outsider
on
him
said
philo
gubb
i
fetch
along
this
letter
you
wrote
me
to
certify
your
identical
identity
he
picked
up
the
warning
letter
from
the
rising
sun
agency
and
stood
waiting
for
the
bald
impostor
to
arise
but
the
bald
impostor
did
not
arise
for
once
at
least
he
was
flabbergasted
he
opened
and
shut
his
mouth
like
a
fish
out
of
water
his
head
seemed
to
exude
millions
of
moist
beads
he
saw
a
smile
of
triumph
on
philo
gubb
face
gubb
was
smiling
triumphantly
because
he
was
able
now
to
show
judge
orley
morvis
a
thing
or
two
but
the
bald
impostor
was
sure
philo
gubb
knew
he
was
the
bald
impostor
he
was
caught
and
he
knew
it
so
he
surrendered
all
right
he
said
nervously
you
got
me
i
wo
give
you
any
trouble
it
me
that
being
a
troubling
nuisance
to
you
burns
said
philo
gubb
the
detective
stopped
short
a
look
of
shame
passed
across
his
face
i
hope
you
will
humbly
pardon
me
burns
he
said
contritely
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
to
think
of
me
starting
to
get
you
to
attend
to
my
business
when
you
have
business
much
more
important
that
fetched
you
to
riverbank
a
sudden
light
seemed
to
break
upon
philo
gubb
of
a
certain
course
he
exclaimed
what
you
come
about
was
this
this
he
looked
at
the
letter
in
his
hand
this
bald
impostor
was
it
philo
gubb
visitor
who
had
begun
to
breathe
normally
again
gasped
like
a
fish
once
more
he
saw
philo
gubb
finish
reading
the
description
of
the
bald
impostor
and
then
philo
gubb
looked
up
and
looked
the
bald
impostor
full
in
the
face
he
looked
the
bald
impostor
over
from
bald
spot
to
shoes
and
looked
back
again
at
the
description
item
by
item
he
compared
the
description
in
the
letter
with
the
appearance
of
the
man
before
him
while
the
impostor
continued
to
wipe
the
palms
of
his
hands
with
the
balled
handkerchief
at
last
philo
gubb
nodded
his
head
exactly
similar
to
the
most
nominal
respects
he
said
quite
identical
in
every
shape
and
manner
oh
i
admit
it
i
admit
it
said
the
bald
impostor
hopelessly
yes
sir
said
philo
gubb
and
i
admit
it
the
whilst
i
admire
it
it
is
the
most
perfect
disguise
of
an
imitation
i
ever
looked
at
what
asked
the
bald
impostor
the
disguise
you
got
onto
yourself
said
philo
gubb
it
is
most
marvelously
similar
in
likeness
to
the
description
in
the
letter
if
you
will
take
the
complimentary
flattery
of
a
student
burns
i
will
say
i
never
seen
no
better
disguise
got
up
in
the
world
you
are
a
real
deteckative
artist
the
bald
impostor
could
not
speak
he
could
only
gasp
if
i
did
know
who
you
were
of
your
own
self
said
philo
gubb
in
the
most
complimentary
tones
i
have
thought
you
were
this
here
descriptioned
bald
impostor
himself
his
visitor
moistened
his
lips
to
speak
but
gubb
did
not
give
him
an
opportunity
i
presume
said
gubb
you
have
so
done
because
you
are
working
upon
this
bald
impostor
yourself
yes
oh
yes
said
the
bald
impostor
hoarsely
exactly
in
that
case
said
gubb
i
consider
it
a
high
compliment
for
you
to
call
upon
me
us
deteckatives
do
usually
visit
around
in
disguises
the
visitor
moistened
his
lips
again
i
wanted
to
see
he
said
but
the
words
were
so
hoarse
they
could
hardly
be
heard
i
wanted
to
see
well
now
said
philo
gubb
contritely
you
must
feel
bad
that
i
did
take
you
for
that
fraud
feller
right
away
off
i
had
read
the
letter
through
down
to
the
description
quite
if
i
had
i
would
have
mistook
you
for
him
at
once
the
resemblance
is
most
remarkably
unique
thank
you
said
the
bald
impostor
regaining
more
of
his
usual
confidence
and
it
was
a
hard
disguise
for
me
to
assume
i
not
naturally
reddish
like
this
my
hair
is
long
and
black
and
and
my
taste
in
clothes
is
quiet
mostly
blacks
or
dark
blues
now
the
reason
i
am
in
this
disguise
he
was
interrupted
by
a
loud
and
strenuous
knock
on
the
door
gubb
went
to
the
door
but
before
he
reached
it
his
visitor
had
made
one
leap
and
was
hidden
behind
the
office
desk
for
a
voice
had
called
impatiently
gubb
and
it
was
the
voice
of
judge
orley
morvis
when
detective
gubb
had
greeted
his
new
visitor
he
turned
to
introduce
the
judge
and
a
look
of
blank
surprise
swept
his
features
detective
burns
was
gone
for
a
moment
only
detective
gubb
was
puzzled
there
was
but
one
place
in
the
room
capable
of
concealing
a
human
being
and
that
was
the
space
behind
the
desk
he
placed
a
chair
for
the
judge
exactly
in
front
of
the
desk
and
himself
stood
in
a
negligent
attitude
with
one
elbow
on
the
top
of
the
desk
in
this
position
he
was
able
to
turn
his
head
and
by
craning
his
neck
a
little
look
down
upon
the
false
burns
burns
made
violent
gestures
urging
secrecy
gubb
allayed
his
fears
i
glad
you
come
just
now
judge
he
said
because
we
can
say
a
few
or
more
words
together
there
being
nobody
here
but
you
and
me
i
presume
you
come
to
talk
about
the
per
diem
charge
i
charged
to
you
did
you
yes
i
did
said
the
judge
well
i
be
able
to
prove
quite
presently
or
sooner
that
the
price
is
correctly
said
gubb
because
the
leading
head
of
the
rising
sun
deteckative
agency
is
right
in
town
and
as
soon
as
he
gets
done
with
a
job
he
has
on
hand
he
going
up
to
see
you
maybe
you
heard
of
allwood
burns
he
wrote
the
correspondence
lessons
in
deteckating
by
which
i
graduated
out
of
the
deteckative
correspondence
school
never
heard
of
him
in
my
life
said
the
judge
this
here
said
gubb
not
without
pride
is
a
personal
letter
i
got
from
him
this
just
now
and
he
handed
the
judge
the
letter
judge
orley
morvis
took
the
letter
with
an
air
of
disdain
and
began
to
read
it
with
a
certain
irritating
superciliousness
almost
immediately
he
began
to
turn
red
behind
the
ears
then
his
ears
turned
red
then
his
whole
face
turned
red
he
breathed
hard
his
hand
shook
with
rage
well
of
all
the
infernal
he
began
and
stopped
has
the
aforesaid
impostor
been
to
see
asked
philo
gubb
eagerly
me
nonsense
exclaimed
the
judge
violently
do
you
think
i
would
be
taken
in
by
a
child
trick
like
this
nonsense
gubb
nonsense
i
did
hardly
think
it
was
possible
said
detective
gubb
possible
cried
the
judge
with
anger
do
you
think
a
common
faker
like
that
could
hoodwink
me
give
an
impostor
twenty
dollars
nonsense
sir
he
arose
he
was
in
a
great
rage
about
it
he
stamped
to
the
door
and
do
let
me
hear
you
retailing
any
such
lie
about
me
around
this
town
sir
he
exclaimed
he
slammed
the
door
and
then
the
bald
impostor
slowly
raised
his
head
above
the
desk
what
did
you
hide
for
asked
philo
gubb
the
bald
impostor
wiped
his
bedewed
brow
hide
he
said
questioningly
oh
yes
i
did
hide
did
i
yes
yes
i
hid
you
see
you
see
the
judge
came
in
if
you
had
hid
said
philo
gubb
i
could
have
got
that
business
of
the
per
diem
charge
per
day
fixed
up
right
here
i
was
going
to
introduce
him
to
you
yes
going
to
introduce
him
to
me
said
the
bald
impostor
that
was
it
that
was
why
i
hid
you
were
going
to
introduce
him
to
me
you
see
i
do
quite
comprehend
the
meaning
of
the
reason
said
philo
gubb
why
you
see
said
the
bald
impostor
glibly
you
see
if
you
introduced
me
to
him
why
why
he
know
me
he
know
you
said
philo
gubb
he
know
me
repeated
the
false
burns
i
tell
you
why
the
bald
impostor
call
on
him
honest
i
was
there
said
the
bald
impostor
the
judge
gave
him
twenty
dollars
and
a
copy
of
some
book
or
other
he
had
written
and
he
wrote
his
autograph
in
the
book
remember
that
the
judge
wrote
his
autograph
in
a
book
and
gave
it
to
the
fellow
i
telling
you
this
so
you
can
tell
the
judge
tell
him
i
told
you
tell
him
the
mother
is
much
better
now
tell
him
judge
bassio
bates
toe
is
quite
well
and
then
ask
him
for
the
twenty
dollars
he
owes
you
you
get
it
and
you
was
there
asked
philo
gubb
amazed
out
of
sight
but
there
said
the
false
burns
glibly
just
ready
to
put
my
hand
on
the
fellow
but
i
could
i
had
the
heart
to
do
it
i
thought
of
the
ridicule
it
would
bring
down
on
the
poor
old
judge
you
know
he
an
uncle
of
mine
i
his
nephew
he
said
said
philo
gubb
hesitatingly
he
never
heard
of
you
he
never
did
said
the
bald
impostor
promptly
i
was
his
third
sister
adopted
child
i
am
an
adopted
nephew
and
of
course
you
know
he
would
never
have
anything
to
do
with
his
sister
after
she
married
ah
general
winston
wells
not
a
thing
it
was
what
killed
my
poor
foster
mother
grief
he
wiped
his
eyes
with
his
silk
handkerchief
grief
yes
grief
and
i
had
the
heart
to
bring
shame
to
the
old
man
by
arresting
the
impostor
in
his
house
by
showing
that
the
good
old
man
was
such
a
silly
old
fellow
as
to
be
done
by
a
simple
trick
and
what
did
it
matter
i
can
pick
up
the
bald
impostor
in
derlingport
in
derlingport
queried
philo
gubb
in
derlingport
said
the
bald
impostor
nervously
for
that
is
where
he
went
i
get
him
there
but
half
of
the
thousand
dollars
is
rightfully
yours
and
you

have
it
thousand
dollars
queried
philo
gubb
in
amazement
the
reward
has
been
increased
said
the
false
burns
the
the
publishers
of
who
increased
it
to
a
thousand
because
the
bald
impostor
works
on
the
names
in
their
book
they
thought
they
ought
to
but
you
shall
have
your
half
of
the
thousand
i
can
pick
him
up
in
derlingport
this
afternoon
if

here
in
riverbank
where

are
our
correspondent
and
thus
entitled
to
half
the
reward
earned
by
any
one
in
the
head
office

knew
that
did
you
no
said
philo
gubb
am
i
did
you
get
circular
no
asked
the
bald
impostor
i
did
ever
get
the
receipt
of
it

gubb
an
oversight

the
bald
impostor
i
send
you
one
the
minute

get
back
to
chicago

pick
up
the
bald
impostor
at
derlingport
this
afternoon
if
gubb
i
am
ashamed
to
make
an
admission
to
you
i
the
bald
impostor
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
and
pearls
of
perspiration
came
upon
his
brow
he
took
out
his
silk
handkerchief
and
wiped
his
forehead
go
right
on
ahead
and
say
whatever
you
got
upon
your
mind
to
say
said
gubb
well
the
fact
is
said
the
false
burns
nervously
i
short
of
cash
i
need
just
one
dollar
and
eighty
cents
to
get
to
derlingport
why
of
course
said
philo
gubb
heartily
all
of
us
get
into
similar
or
like
predicaments
at
various
often
times
burns
it
is
a
pleasure
to
be
able
to
help
out
a
feller
deteckative
in
such
a
time
and
manner
only
yes
said
the
bald
impostor
nervously
only
i
could
think
of
giving
you
only
the
bare
mere
sum
to
get
to
derlingport
said
the
graduate
of
the
rising
sun
detective
correspondence
school
of
detecting
generously
i
could
think
of
letting
you
start
off
away
with
anything
less
than
a
bill
dietz
bessie
john
philo
gubb
sat
on
an
upturned
bundle
of
rolls
of
in
the
of
pilker
famous
pilker
mansion
in
riverbank
biting
into
a
thick
ham
sandwich
it
was
noon
gubb
ate
methodically
taking
a
large
bite
of
sandwich
chewing
the
bite
long
and
well
and
then
swallowing
it
with
a
wonderful
up
and
down
gliding
of
his
knobby
adam
apple
from
time
to
time
he
turned
his
head
and
looked
at
the
walls
of
the
the
time
was
saturday
noon
and
but
one
wall
was
covered
with
the
new
a
natural
forest
tapestry
paper
with
lifelike
representations
of
leafy
trees
he
had
promised
to
have
the
pilker
completed
by
saturday
night
it
seemed
quite
impossible
to
philo
gubb
that
he
could
finish
the
pilker
before
dark
and
it
worried
him
other
matters
even
closer
to
his
heart
worried
gubb
he
had
had
a
great
quarrel
with
medderbrook
the
father
of
the
fair
fat
lady
of
the
world
greatest
combined
shows
judge
orley
morvis
had
paid
gubb
twenty
dollars
for
certain
detective
work
but
gubb
had
not
turned
all
this
over
to
medderbrook
and
medderbrook
had
resented
this
he
told
gubb
he
was
a
cheap
sport
i
worked
hard
said
medderbrook
to
sell
you
that
utterly
hopeless
stock
and
now
you
hold
out
on
me
that
not
the
way
i
expect
a
i
beg
your
pardon
but
what
was
that
term
of
phrase
you
called
me
asked
gubb
i
called
you
said
medderbrook
changing
his
tone
to
one
of
politeness
an
in
high
financial
circles
the
term
is
short
for
meaning
one
who
never
buys
stocks
unless
he
is
sure
they
are
of
the
highest
class
and
at
the
lowest
price
well
i
should
hereafter
prefer
not
to
be
so
called
said
gubb
almost
as
soon
as
he
had
said
the
cruel
words
he
regretted
them
but
the
next
day
medderbrook
colored
butler
came
to
office
with
a
telegram
for
which
he
demanded
dollars
and
fifty
cents
gubb
trembled
with
emotion
as
he
paid
for
it
meant
that
syrilla
was
still
losing
flesh
and
that
dorgan
must
surely
cancel
his
contract
with
her
soon
the
telegram
read
happy
days
still
shrinking
have
lost
one
hundred
and
pounds
since
last

sure
to
be
canceled
as
soon
as
dorgan
gets
back
from
hurried
trip
to
siam
weather
very
hot
can
feel
myself
shrink
fond
thoughts
to
my
gubby
the
very
next
day
the
colored
butler
brought
gubb
another
telegram
fifty
dollars
please
sah
he
said
what
cried
gubb
yes
sah
said
the
negro
that
the
amount
mistah
meddahbrook
done
say
gubb
could
hardly
believe
it
but
he
wrote
his
check
for
the
fifty
dollars
and
then
read
the
telegram
it
ran
excelsior
have
lost
two
hundred
pounds
since
last

only
four
hundred
pounds
every
one
guys
me
when
i
am
ballyhooed
as
fat
lady
affection
to
gubby
gubb
was
greatly
pleased
by
this
but
when
the
next
day
the
colored
butler
again
appeared
and
asked
for
fifty
dollars
gubb
was
worried
the
telegram
this
time
read
frightened
have
lost
two
hundred
pounds
since
last
wire
now

only
two
hundred
if

and

to
gubby

a
man
who
looked
like
napoleon
bonaparte
gone
to
seed
that
same
afternoon
the
negro
brought
gubb
another
telegram
on
which
he
collected
seven
dollars
and
fifty
cents
this
telegram
contained
these
words

indeed
frightened

cereals
but
have
lost
fifty
pounds
more
weigh
only
one
hundred
and
fifty
taking
tonic
hope
for
the
best
tell
gubby
i
think
of
him
as
much
as
when
i
weighed
half
a
ton
gubb
was
much
distressed
he
had
no
doubt
that
his
syrilla
would
rapidly
recover
a
part
of
her
lost
weight
but
he
felt
as
if
at
the
moment
he
had
lost
syrilla
he
could
not
picture
her
as
a
sylph
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
he
was
worried
indeed
as
he
sat
eating
his
lunch
in
pilker
mansion
it
was
then
he
heard
a
voice
say
are
you
the
feller
they
call
bugg
gubb
looked
up
in
the
door
stood
a
man
who
looked
like
napoleon
bonaparte
gone
to
seed

are
looking
for
to

gubb

somewhat
offended

to
the
stranger
he
removed

greasy
coat
threw
his
greasy
cap
into
a
corner
wiped
his
greasy
hands
on
a
wad
of
trimmings
and
set
to
work
when
gubb
had
completed
his
modest
luncheon
he
asked
his
name
youse
might
as
well
call

greasy
said
the
new
employee
greasier
than
anything
got
it
my
during
the
afternoon
philo
gubb
learned
something
of
his
immediate
past
greasy
had
saved
some
money
working
at
paul
and
had
bought
a
some
boat
he
said
streak
lightnin
was
what
i
named
her
and
she
was
and
he
had
come
down
the
mississippi
she
can
beat
anything
on
the
dad
he
said
the
dad
was
his
disrespectful
paraphrase
of
the
father
of
waters
the
title
of
the
giant
mississippi
he
told
of
his
adventures
until
he
mentioned
the
silver
sides
then
he
swore
in
a
manner
that
suited
his
piratical
countenance
exactly
he
had
been
floating
peacefully
down
the
river
with
the
current
his
power
shut
off
and
himself
asleep
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
doing
no
harm
to
any
one
when
along
came
the
silver
sides
and
without
giving
him
a
warning
signal
ran
him
down
done
it
too
he
said
angrily
he
had
managed
to
keep
the
boat
afloat
until
he
reached
riverbank
but
to
fix
her
up
would
take
more
money
than
he
had
so
he
had
hunted
a
job
in
his
own
line
and
found
philo
gubb
the
silver
sides
captain
brooks
owner
was
a
small
packet
plying
between
derlingport
and
bardenton
stopping
at
riverbank
which
was
midway
between
the
two
no
one
knowing
captain
brooks
would
have
suspected
him
of
running
down
anything
whatever
he
was
a
kind
stout
old
gentleman
he
had
a
nice
motherly
old
wife
and
eight
children
mainly
girls
and
they
made
their
home
on
the
silver
sides
brooks
and
the
girls
cooked
for
the
crew
and
kept
the
boat
as
neat
as
a
new
pin
captain
brooks
occupied
the
tom
brooks
served
as
first
mate
and
bill
brooks
acted
as
purser
altogether
they
were
a
delightfully
and
family
it
was
hard
to
believe
they
would
run
down
a
helpless
in
but
greasy
swore
to
it
and
about
it
during
the
next
few
weeks
greasy
and
the
detective
worked
side
by
side
greasy
had
every
night
and
all
sunday
for
his
own
purposes
once
gubb
met
greasy
carrying
a
large
bundle
of
canvas
and
gubb
imagined
greasy
was
fitting
a
mast
and
sail
to
the
on
july
the
independent
horde
of
kalmucks
gave
a
moonlight
excursion
on
the
mississippi
chartering
the
silver
sides
for
the
purpose
the
kalmucks
were
the
leading
lodge
of
the
town
and
leaders
also
in
social
affairs
they
gave
frequent
dramatic
entertainments
in
their
hall
in
winter
and
outdoors
in
the
big
yard
back
of
kalmuck
temple
in
the
summer
in
the
entire
history
of
the
lodge
there
had
never
been
so
much
as
an
untoward
incident
but
at
eleven
on
the
night
of
july
something
frightful
did
occur
it
spread
it
across
the
top
of
the
first
page
of
the
daily
eagle
in
the
one
shocking
word
pirates
the
silver
star
had
started
on
the
return
trip
and
had
reached
a
point
about
two
miles
below
towhead
island
when
a
rifle
or
revolver
bullet
crashed
through
the
glass
window
on
the
western
side
of
the
uncle
jerry
as
most
people
called
captain
brooks
turned
his
head
stared
out
at
the
moonlit
waters
of
the
river
and
saw
bearing
down
upon
him
from
the
northwest
a
long
low
craft
four
men
stood
in
the
forward
part
of
the
boat
and
a
fifth
sat
beside
the
motor
in
the
bright
moonlight
captain
brooks
could
see
that
all
the
men
wore
black
masks
he
also
saw
that
all
were
armed
and
that
from
the
staff
at
the
stern
of
the
boat
floated
a
flag
on
which
was
painted
in
white
the
skull
and
that
have
always
been
the
insignia
of
pirates
even
as
he
looked
one
of
the
men
in
the
raised
his
arm
uncle
jerry
saw
a
flash
of
fire
and
another
pane
of
glass
at
his
side
jingled
to
the
floor
the
low
black
craft
swept
rapidly
across
the
bows
of
the
silver
sides
the
sputtering
of
its
motor
ceased
and
the
next
moment
the
pirates
were
aboard
the
barge
lining
up
the
dancers
at
the
points
of
their
pistols
and
preparing
to
take
away
their
money
and
they
did
take
it
they
began
at
the
bow
of
the
barge
and
walked
to
the
stern
making
one
after
another
of
the
excursionists
deliver
his
valuables
and
then
slipped
quietly
over
the
stern
of
the
barge
the
pirate
craft
began
to
spit
and
sputter
furiously
and
the
next
moment
it
was
tearing
through
the
water
like
a
streak
of
lightning
to
chase
a
in
an
elderly
river
packet
would
have
been
nonsense
uncle
jerry
signaled
full
speed
ahead
and
kept
to
the
channel
where
his
boat
belonged
presently
brooks
panting
climbed
to
the
well
pa
she
said
pirates
has
been
and
robbed

said
uncle
jerry

brooks

brooks

like

of

twentieth
century
in

a
fool
detective
snapped
brooks
you
come
up
and
ask
me
to
throw
my
money
into
the
river
philo
gubb
although
not
a
dancer
had
been
on
the
barge
when
it
was
attacked
because
he
was
a
lover
of
he
too
had
been
lined
up
and
robbed
he
had
been
robbed
not
only
of
forty
perfectly
good
cents
but
his
pirate
had
seen
his
opal
and
had
rudely
taken
it
from
gubb
tie
the
pirate
was
gubb
noticed
a
short
heavy
man
with
greasy
hands
as
the
dashed
away
gubb
pressed
to
the
rear
of
the
barge
and
looked
after
it
as
the
boat
regained
her
speed
philomela
brooks
approached
him
oh
mr
gubb
she
exclaimed
i
so
tremulous
if
you
will
kindly
not
interrupt
me
at
the
present
moment
of
time
said
gubb
i
will
be
much
obliged
i
am
making
an
endeavor
to
try
to
do
some
deteckative
work
onto
this
case
oh
mr
gubb
miss
philomela
cried
and
you
think
you
do
any
good
in
the
deteckative
business
said
gubb
sternly
we
try
to
do
all
the
good
we
can
do
whether
we
can
do
it
or
not
and
he
turned
away
and
sought
a
more
secluded
spot
the
affair
of
the
pirate
craft
caused
a
tremendous
sensation
in
riverbank
before
eight
the
next
morning
every
one
in
riverbank
seemed
to
have
heard
of
the
affair
and
when
at
eight
philo
gubb
entered
the
vacant
himmeldinger
house
which
he
was
decorating
he
started
with
surprise
to
see
greasy
already
there
he
had
not
expected
to
see
him
at
all
but
there
he
was
trimming
the
edge
of
a
roll
of
dietz
bessie
john
and
as
he
turned
to
greet
gubb
the
detective
saw
in
greasy
greasy
tie
what
seemed
to
be
his
own
opal
that
there
said
gubb
sternly
is
a
nice
you
got
into
your
tie
ai
it
said
greasy
proudly
me
new
give
it
to
me
last
night
to
greasy
detective
gubb
said
nothing
he
was
not
yet
ready
to
act
but
to
himself
he
muttered
that
there
is
a
clue
i
had
ought
to
look
into
in
the
town
excitement
was
high
all
day
there
was
some
time
wasted
while
the
chief
of
police
and
the
county
sheriff
tried
to
discover
which
was
compelled
by
law
to
fight
pirates
but
the
chief
of
police
finally
put
the
job
on
the
sheriff
hands
and
the
old
fourth
of
july
cannon
was
loaded
with
powder
and
nails
and
put
on
the
bow
of
the
good
haddon
rogers
a
posse
of
about
three
hundred
men
with
shotguns
and
army
muskets
was
crowded
aboard
and
the
got
under
way
this
was
of
course
monday
and
monday
the
silver
sides
made
her
usual
trip
to
bardenton
leaving
in
the
morning
and
returning
late
at
night
it
was
usually
two
at
night
when
she
tied
up
at
the
riverbank
levee
but
this
time
two
came
without
the
silver
sides
there
was
a
good
reason
as
the
packet
neared
hog
island
about
two
miles
below
the
towhead
on
her
return
trip
uncle
jerry
heard
the
sputter
of
a
gas
engine
and
saw
dart
out
from
below
hog
island
the
same
low
black
craft
that
had
carried
the
pirates
before
even
before
the
craft
was
within
range
the
revolvers
began
to
spit
at
the
silver
sides
well
dang
them
pirates
to
the
dickens
exclaimed
uncle
jerry
if
they
be
goin
to
keep
up
this
nonsense
i
goin
to
get
mad
at
but
he
signaled
the
to
slow
down
as
if
it
was
getting
to
be
a
habit
with
him
one
of
the
upper
panes
just
above
his
line
of
vision
clattered
down
as
he
pulled
the
at
the
first
volley
ma
brooks
and
her
daughters
dashed
into
the
galley
and
slammed
the
door
the
remainder
of
the
male
brookses
made
two
jumps
to
the
coal
bins
and
began
burrowing
into
the
coal
and
the
three
members
of
the
crew
dived
into
openings
between
the
small
piles
of
cargo
stuff
and
tried
to
become
invisible
when
the
pirates
clambered
aboard
the
silver
star
they
seemed
to
be
boarding
a
deserted
vessel
they
worked
quickly
and
thoroughly
piece
by
piece
they
threw
the
cargo
of
the
silver
sides
into
the
until
they
uncovered
the
three
members
of
the
crew
who
leaped
from
their
like
startled
rabbits
and
loped
wildly
to
places
of
greater
safety
half
a
dozen
revolver
shots
followed
them
the
pirates
then
leisurely
reëmbarked
fired
a
parting
salute
and
glided
away
the
next
morning
greasy
appeared
at
work
with
his
pocket
full
of
sultana
raisins
and
offered
some
to
gubb
thank
you
said
gubb
raisins
are
one
of
my
foremost
fondnesses
nice
ones
like
these
are
hard
to
find
obtainable
you
right
they
are
said
greasy
me
give
me
these
last
night
she
the
girl
that
knows
good
raisins
ai
she
evidently
she
was
but
philo
gubb
had
taken
occasion
to
discover
before
he
went
to
work
that
morning
whether
the
silver
sides
had
been
pirated
again
and
he
had
learned
that
a
boxes
of
sultana
raisins
had
formed
part
of
the
cargo
of
the
silver
sides
he
looked
at
greasy
severely
your
is
considerably
generous
in
giving
things
she
he
said
trying
to
hide
the
guile
of
his
questions
in
an
indifferent
tone
you
ai
cared
to
mention
her
name
to
me
as
yet
to
this
time
ai
i
said
greasy
carelessly
well
i
ai
ashamed
of
her
her

some
girl

most
of
your
evenings

right
glad
to

a
barn

philo
gubb

sleepin
in
a

greasy
i

of

barn
i

yawning
my
till

i
presume
you

much
time
on
your

late
times
said
gubb
ai
had
no
time
said
greasy
briefly
detective
gubb
as
he
pasted
paper
on
the
walls
of
the
himmeldinger
house
turned
various
matters
over
and
over
in
his
mind
his
clues
pointed
as
clearly
to
greasy
as
the
great
dipper
points
to
the
north
star
he
had
decided
to
join
the
posse
on
the
haddon
rogers
when
she
set
out
on
her
next
voyage
of
vengeance
but
now
he
changed
his
mind
a
barn
large
and
vacant
would
be
an
excellent
place
in
which
to
hide
the
proceeds
of
a
pirate
raid
lest
possibly
the
barn
should
recognize
him
and
hide
itself
gubb
first
went
to
his
office
in
the
opera
house
building
disguised
himself
as
a
hostler
with
cowhide
boots
a
cob
pipe
a
battered
straw
hat
and
blue
jean
trousers
lest
his
face
be
recognized
by
the
barn
he
wore
a
set
of
red
whiskers
which
would
have
been
more
natural
had
they
been
a
paler
shade
of
scarlet
thus
disguised
he
crept
softly
down
the
opera
house
building
stairs
and
ran
full
into
billy
getz
riverbank
best
example
of
the
spoiled
species
and
the
town
inveterate
jester
getz
put
a
hand
on
gubb
arm
he
said
mysteriously

pirate
business

into
the
country
and
back
across
the
cemetery
as
advised
in
lesson
thirteen
would
you
there
are
only
twelve
lessons
said
gubb
haughtily
and
stalked
away
he
went
however
to
hampton
barn
climbed
in
through
the
alley
window
and
searched
the
place
the
barn
contained
nothing
of
interest
a
cot
stood
at
one
end
of
the
and
stretched
across
the
wall
at
the
other
end
was
a
canvas
on
which
was
a
partly
completed
scene
of
a
ruined
castle
with
mountains
in
the
distance
on
the
floor
were
pails
and
brushes
bundles
of
dry
colors
glue
and
the
various
articles
needed
by
a
gubb
looked
behind
the
canvas
no
loot
was
concealed
there
he
returned
to
his
office
discarded
his
disguise
and
went
back
to
the
himmeldinger
house
seated
on
the
front
steps
quite
neglecting
his
work
was
greasy
and
beside
him
sat
a
girl
this
said
greasy
is
maggie
tiffkins
youse
ought
to
know
her
mag
consider
this
a
proper
knockdown
to
gubb
my
boss
that
night
the
silver
sides
was
attacked
by
the
pirates
on
her
return
from
derlingport
the
next
morning
gubb
awaited
greasy
coming
impatiently
hoping
for
a
new
clue
but
greasy
had
none
he
was
glum
he
had
had
a
quarrel
with
maggie
and
he
was
cross
last
job
of
work
i
ever
do
for
billy
getz
and
them
kalmucks
of
he
said
crossly
he
gettin
worse
and
worse
them
first
two
scenes
i
painted
he
kicked
enough
about
said
the
forest
scene
looked
like
a
sandwich
and
asked
me
if
the
parlor
scene
was
a
or
a
but
when
i
do
a
old
bum
castle
and
he
wants
to
know
if
it
a
interior
i
get
hot
and
so
would
youse
for
three
nights
the
silver
sides
now
protected
by
the
presence
of
part
of
the
armed
posse
was
not
disturbed
but
on
the
fourth
night
the
low
black
pirate
craft
boldly
attacked
the
steamer
carrying
on
a
running
fight
the
pirates
did
not
venture
to
board
her
but
the
piratical
business
was
getting
to
be
an
unbearable
nuisance
to
uncle
jerry
brooks
a
dozen
small
craft
were
armed
and
patrolled
the
river
on
the
fourteenth
night
when
the
silver
sides
was
on
her
derlingport
trip
the
jane
the
opposition
steamer
making
the
same
ports
was
boldly
attacked
by
the
pirates
and
lost
the
most
precious
part
of
her
cargo
it
was
then
determined
to
exterminate
the
pirates
at
any
cost
once
only
had
a
steamer
been
attacked
above
the
town
and
this
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
pirates
had
their
nest
below
riverbank
and
this
was
the
more
likely
as
the
river
below
town
gave
far
greater
opportunities
for
hiding
the
pirate
boat
during
the
day
there
were
several
sloughs
or
bayous
and
many
indentations
of
the
while
above
the
town
there
was
none
above
the
town
the
shores
sloped
back
from
the
river
edge
and
even
a
skiff
on
the
shore
could
be
seen
from
across
the
river
the
search
for
the
pirate
vessel
was
therefore
conducted
below
the
town
but
most
unsuccessfully
gubb
in
the
three
weeks
during
which
the
search
went
on
exhausted
all
his
disguises
and
every
page
of
the
twelve
lessons
of
the
rising
sun
detective
agency
correspondence
school
of
detecting
he
was
in
a
condition
bordering
on
despair
each
day
he
donned
a
disguise
and
visited
the
barn
and
saw
nothing
but
scenery
and
more
scenery
he
had
reached
a
point
where
detective
skill
seemed
to
fail
and
where
he
feared
he
might
have
to
go
openly
to
greasy
and
ask
him
whether
he
was
the
pirate
or
at
least
go
to
maggie
and
ask
her
where
she
had
obtained
the
and
the
raisins
and
that
would
not
have
been
detecting
nothing
like
it
was
mentioned
in
the
twelve
lessons
a
reward
of
one
hundred
dollars
rewards
are
always
in
capital
letters
had
been
offered
by
the
business
men
association
for
the
capture
of
the
pirate
craft
but
no
one
seemed
likely
to
earn
the
reward
say
honest
said
greasy
if
my
boat
was
workin
i
go
out
alone
in
her
and
cop
off
them
hundred
dollars
youse
is
a
detective
gubb
why
do
youse
get
to
work
and
grab
them
dollars
your
boat
is
not
into
a
workable
condition
asked
philo
gubb
she
all
but
that
said
greasy
she
hauled
up
on
the
levee
rottin
like
a
tomato
i
tried
to
sell
her
to
muller
the
grocery
feller
where
mag
gets
them
raisins
you
liked
and
i
tried
to
trade
her
for
a
ring
to
calloway
the
jewelry
man
what
mag
got
my
opal
of
but
i
ca
get
rid
of
her
nohow
if
i
had
her
workin
i
find
them
pirates
or
i
know
why
i
have
remembered
the
thought
of
something
i
got
to
go
downtown
said
gubb
and
he
left
greasy
and
went
to
question
muller
and
calloway
the
one
admitted
selling
mag
the
raisins
and
the
other
the
pin
and
thus
two
perfectly
good
clues
went
bad
gubb
turned
toward
fifth
street
when
billy
getz
caught
him
by
the
arm
come
on
and
hunt
pirates
he
said
the
good
cruiser
haddon
rogers
is
going
to
hit
a
new
trail
this
time
come
on
along
billy
getz
escorted
him
aboard
the
haddon
rogers
and
led
him
straight
to
the
sheriff
on
the
upper
deck
sheriff
he
said
we
got
now
this
time
we
got
sure
here
gubb
the
famous
gubb
detective
and
after
many
solicitations
he
has
consented
to
accompany
us
we
will
have
the
pirate
craft
ere
we
return
gubb
never
fails
the
sheriff
smiled
always
kidding
ai
you
billy
he
said
the
boat
started
she
steamed
slowly
up
the
river
the
members
of
the
posse
on
the
upper
deck
on
either
side
scanning
the
shores
carefully
occasionally
the
backed
and
ran
closer
to
shore
to
permit
a
nearer
inspection
of
some
skiff
or
to
view
some
log
left
on
the
shore
by
the
last
flood
billy
getz
standing
beside
the
sheriff
and
gubb
called
their
attention
to
every
shadow
and
lump
on
the
shore
the
boat
proceeded
on
her
slow
course
and
reached
the
channel
between
an
island
and
the
illinois
shore
the
wooded
bank
of
the
island
rose
directly
from
the
water
some
of
the
dipping
their
roots
into
the
river
there
was
no
place
where
a
boat
could
be
hidden
and
the
ferry
steamed
slowly
along
billy
getz
poked
fun
at
gubb
in
the
most
serious
manner
and
gubb
was
sternly
haughty
knowing
he
was
being
made
sport
of
his
eyes
rested
with
intensity
on
the
wooded
shore
of
the
island
now
this
combination
of
and
detecting
has
its
advantages
said
billy
getz
with
a
wink
at
the
sheriff
when
a
man
philo
gubb
was
not
hearing
him
the
remarkableness
of
the
similarity
of
nature
to
art
is
quite
often
remarkable
to
observe
he
said
to
the
sheriff
and
is
seeming
to
grow
more
so
now
and
then
from
time
to
time
that
piece
of
section
of
woods
right
there
is
so
naturally
grown
you
might
say
it
was
torn
right
off
a
roll
of
dietz
bessie
john
he
stopped
short
what
the
matter
asked
billy
getz
nervously
run
the
boat
in
there
said
philo
gubb
excitedly
those
verdures
ai
bessie
john
they
bessie
john
the
sheriff
stared
keenly
at
the
spot
indicated
by
detective
extended
hand
and
turning
suddenly
said
a
word
to
the
pilot
in
the
house
at
his
side
the
ferry
veered
and
ran
in
toward
the
island
not
until
the
boat
was
nearer
the
shore
than
a
front
row
of
the
orchestra
seats
to
the
back
drop
of
a
theater
did
the
others
on
the
boat
understand
then
the
trick
was
seen
and
understood
the
trees
of
the
shore
were
not
all
trees
one
group
was
a
painted
canvas
copied
carefully
by
greasy
from
dietz
bessie
john
at
the
behest
of
billy
getz
stretched
across
a
small
indentation
of
the
shore
it
made
a
safe
screen
unrecognizable
a
few
rods
from
the
shore
and
behind
this
bit
of
painted
forest
they
found
the
long
low
black
pirate
craft
billy
getz
when
the
sheriff
had
torn
down
the
canvas
and
his
men
had
hoisted
and
heaved
the
pirate
craft
to
the
broad
deck
of
the
ferry
billy
getz
was
gone
riverbank
never
saw
him
again
and
a
of
his
roistering
companions
also
disappeared
completely
sometimes
occasionally
said
philo
gubb
as
the
ferry
turned
toward
town
the
combination
of
and
deteckative
work
is
detrimental
to
one
or
both
as
the
case
may
be
but
at
other
occasional
times
they
are
worth
one
hundred
dollars
that
right
said
the
sheriff
suddenly
you
get
that
reward
you
most
certainly
sure
said
philo
gubb
henry
philo
gubb
entered
his
office
and
placed
on
his
the
express
package
he
had
found
leaning
against
his
door
with
his
he
cut
the
cord
that
bound
the
package
it
contained
he
knew
the
new
disguise
for
which
he
had
sent
dollars
to
the
rising
sun
detective
agency
supply
bureau
and
he
was
eager
to
examine
his
purchase
which
in
the
catalogue
was
known
as
no
french
count
with
beard
and
wig
complete
list
special
price
to
our
graduates
express
paid
gubb
wore
a
face
more
solemn
than
usual
for
he
had
just
had
bad
news
he
had
hidden
his
distrust
of
medderbrook
the
father
of
his
beloved
syrilla
and
had
carried
that
gentleman
the
one
hundred
dollars
he
had
earned
by
aiding
in
the
capture
of
the
river
pirates
but
he
had
found
medderbrook
close
to
tears
read
this
gubb
medderbrook
said
and
that
he
was
deeply
affected
was
shown
by
the
fact
that
he
did
not
ask
gubb
to
pay
any
part
of
the
cost
of
the
telegram
from
syrilla
which
had
this
time
come
collect
the
telegram
read
scared
crazy
resumed
vegetables
and
all
kinds
of
food
eating
steadily
all
day
and
night
but
have
lost
pounds
more
now
weigh
only
one
hundred
and
and
going
down
rapidly
if
worse
goes
to
worst
love
to
gubby
it
is
not
surprising
that
gubb
sighed
as
he
lifted
the
exaggeratedly
frock
coat
from
the
package
but
there
came
a
tap
on
the
door
and
he
hastily
covered
the
coat
with
the
wrapping
paper
and
turned
to
the
door
enter
in
he
said
and
the
door
opened
cautiously
and
a
short
man
entered
peering
into
the
room
first
and
then
closing
the
door
behind
him
as
cautiously
as
he
had
opened
it
are
you
this
here
detective
feller
he
asked
bluntly
i
am
mister
gubb
deteckating
and
done
to
command
at
your
service
admitted
gubb
wo
you
take
a
seat
onto
a
chair
depends
said
gubb
visitor
keeping
his
hand
on
the
doorknob
i
put
it
to
you
like
this
say
some
guy
stole
something
from
me
and
i
was
willing
to
pay
you
for
finding
out
who
stole
it
and
for
getting
it
back
you
take
a
job
like
that
and
say
nothing
about
it
to
anybody
would
you
most
certainly
sure
agreed
gubb
that
the
idee
you
keep
it
dark
it
would
be
nobody
business
but
yours
and
mine
would
it
it
would
be
a
quiet
little
deal
between
you
and
me
and
nobody
would
know
anything
about
it
hey
exactly
sure
said
philo
gubb
the
deteckative
business
is
conducted
onto
an
absolutely
quiet
basis
correct
said
his
visitor
i
see
you
and
me
can
do
business
now
my
name
is
gus
smith
and
i
had
one
of
the
rawest
deals
handed
me
a
man
ever
had
handed
him
i
was
coming
along
down
one
of
these
alleys
between
streets
this
morning
and
he
stopped
short
and
turned
to
the
door
some
one
had
tapped
on
the
panels
smith
opened
the
door
the
merest
crack
and
peered
out
he
closed
it
again
instantly
somebody
to
see
you
he
whispered
what
i
got
to
say
i
want
kept
private
i
be
back
he
opened
the
door
and
slipped
out
and
as
he
went
a
second
visitor
entered
the
newcomer
was
somewhat
tall
and
thin
and
his
hair
was
long
so
long
it
fell
upon
his
shoulders
in
greasy
curls
he
wore
a
rather
ancient
frock
coat
and
a
black
slouch
hat
and
a
touch
of
style
was
added
by
his
gray
kid
gloves
although
the
weather
was
average
summer
weather
his
face
was
thin
and
adorned
by
a
silky
brown
beard
divided
at
the
chin
and
falling
in
two
carefully
arranged
points
he
closed
the
door
carefully
first
looking
into
the
hall
to
see
that
gus
smith
had
disappeared
gubb
the
detective
he
asked
most
absolutely
sure
said
gubb
my
name
said
gubb
visitor
is
one
you
are
doubtless
familiar
with
i
am
alibaba
singh
pleased
to
meet
your
acquaintance
said
gubb
what
can
i
aim
to
do
for
you
alibaba
singh
brought
a
chair
close
to
gubb
desk
and
seated
himself
he
leaned
close
to
gubb
so
close
that
gubb
scented
the
rank
odor
of
cheap
and
whispered
everything
is
to
be
strictly
confidential
most
strictly
confidential
that
understood
most
absolutely
sure
of
course
now
you
must
have
heard
of
me
i
made
quite
a
stir
here
in
riverbank
since
i
came
theosophical
lectures
first
lessons
in
nirvana
buddhistic
philosophy
mysteries
of
vedaism
et
cetery
i
read
your
advertisement
notices
into
the
newspapers
admitted
gubb
just
so
i
have
done
well
here
many
sought
the
mysteries
i
have
been
unusually
successful
in
riverbank
he
stopped
short
and
looked
at
philo
gubb
suspiciously
you
do
believe
in
transmigration
do
you
he
asked
not
without
i
do
without
knowing
it
said
gubb
what
is
it
transmigration
repeated
alibaba
singh
it
hindoos
believe
in
it
at
death
the
souls
of
the
good
enter
higher
forms
of
life
the
souls
of
the
bad
enter
lower
forms
of
life
if
you
were
a
bad
man
and
died
you
would
become
a
a
dog
or
a
horse
or
or
something
you
believe
that
do
you
most
certainly
not
at
all
said
gubb
i
i
teach
it
said
alibaba
singh
uneasily
it
is
part
of
my
teaching
you
do
aim
to
believe
nothing
of
that
sort
do
you
asked
gubb
as
if
he
could
not
imagine
any
man
so
foolish
now
that
it
said
alibaba
singh
that
why
i
came
to
you
all
this
is
strictly
confidential
of
course
thanks
i
can
speak
right
out
gubb
i
have
in
the
past
taught
some
things
i
did
not
absolutely
believe
quite
likely
true
admitted
philo
gubb
we
we
occulists
get
carried
on
by
our
eloquence
said
alibaba
singh
we
we
go
too
far
sometimes
far
too
far
i
admit
it
i
admit
that
frankly
when
our
clients
reach
out
to
us
for
more
and
more
we
we
sometimes
go
too
far
i
wo
say
we
string
them
along
i
would
say
that
but
we
we
lead
them
farther
than
we
have
gone
ourselves
perhaps
you
understand
almost
absolutely
said
gubb
just
so
gubb
one
of
my
clients
was
greatly
interested
in
transmigration
of
souls
greatly
interested
she
was
interested
in
all
things
mystical
in
reincarnation
in
the
return
of
the
spirits
of
the
dead
in
everything
like
that
i
really
gubb
it
was
hard
for
me
to
keep
up
with
her
and
you
proceeded
to
go
ahead
and
teach
her
about
this
transmigration
of
souls
that
you
do
believe
into
yourself
said
gubb
helpfully
and
when
she
found
out
you
was
a
faker
she
set
out
to
sue
you
for
her
money
back
no
not
that
said
alibaba
singh
energetically
that
not
it
she
does
want
her
money
back
she
she
satisfied
willing
to
accept
what
had
happened
philosophically
she
almost
content
gubb
the
reason
i
came
to
you
was
that
i
did
not
want
her
to
land
in
alibaba
singh
looked
carefully
around
i
do
want
her
to
land
in
jail
he
whispered
it
would
make
trouble
for
me
the
lady
gubb
is
henry
k
lippett
well
queried
gubb
what
i
do
know
said
alibaba
singh
wiping
his
brow
nervously
is
whether
i
reincarnate
her
late
husband
or
whether
liable
to
be
arrested
for
stealing
a
alibaba
singh
stopped
short
and
arose
hastily
some
one
had
knocked
on
gubb
door
alibaba
singh
moved
toward
the
door
i
do
want
to
talk
about
this
with
anybody
around
he
said
nervously
i
come
back
later
not
a
word
about
it
he
brushed
past
gubb
new
visitor
as
he
went
out
and
gubb
arose
to
greet
the
newcomer
this
third
visitor
was
a
large
man
with
an
extremely
loud
vest
he
wore
a
high
hat
of
gray
beaver
and
a
large
but
questionable
diamond
sparkled
on
his
finger
he
walked
directly
up
to
gubb
and
shook
hands
sit
down
he
commanded
now
you
gubb
the
detective
ai
you
good
enough
my
name
is
stephen
watts
but
they
mostly
call
me
steve
for
short
steve
he
added
holding
up
his
right
hand
to
show
that
one
finger
was
missing
i
in
the
show
business
ever
hear
of
john
the
educated
horse
ever
hear
of
hogo
the
human
trilobite
ever
hear
of
henry
the
educated
pig
well
them
are
me
that
my
show
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
sheriff
frequently
often
said
gubb
with
a
smile
well
up
to
derlingport
this
here
human
trilobite
of
mine
got
loose
from
my
tent
and
when
they
found
him
he
had
eat
about
half
of
the
marble
cornerstone
out
from
under
the
dawkins
building
crazy
after
white
marble
it
like
candy
to
him
so
dawkins
attaches
my
show
and
sends
the
sheriff
with
an
execution
to
grab
the
whole
business
unless
i
pay
for
a
new
cornerstone
said
it
would
cost
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
i
did
have
the
money
so
he
took
the
show
said
philo
gubb
said
steve
he
grabbed
the
whole
caboodle
henry
the
educated
pig
that
why
i
here
that
sheriff
attachment
is
out
against
that
pig
it
was
a
felony
to
remove
that
pig
from
derling
county
while
that
attachment
was
out
against
it
the
pig
was
removed
you
removed
it
away
from
there
asked
philo
gubb
listen
said
steve
i
did
remove
that
pig
from
derling
county
it
was
stole
from
me
greasy
gus
stole
it
augustus
smith
my
man
stole
henry
the
educated
pig
and
made
a
with
him
see
see
what
i
want
not
positively
exact
said
philo
gubb
well
it
a
little
bit
delicate
said
steve
and
that
why
i
come
to
you
instead
of
to
the
police
i
want
that
pig
but
if
i
go
to
the
police
and
they
find
the
pig
they
send
it
back
to
the
sheriff
in
derling
county
see
do
you
want
i
should
arrest
greasy
augustus
p
smith
asked
philo
gubb
not
on
your
life
said
vigorously
no
arrests
you
just
get
the
pig
how
big
is
the
size
of
the
pig
asked
philo
gubb
it
a
big
pig
said
watts
henry
has
been
getting
almost
too
fat
and
that
a
fact
i
been
thinking
right
along
i
have
to
diet
henry
but
i
never
got
to
it
he
one
of
these
big
pigs
looks
like
a
prize
pig
in
a
county
fair
and
listen
he
in
this
town
really
indeed
said
gubb
i
know
it
said
steve
i
seen
greasy
gus
load
that
pig
into
a
farm
wagon
at
derlingport
and
i
thought
gus
was
trying
to
salvage
the
pig
for
me
like
one
feller
will
help
out
another
in
time
of
trouble
so
i
come
down
to
riverbank
on
the
train
expecting
gus
would
show
up
at
the
hotel
and
tell
me
where
the
pig
was
hid
all
right
gus
shows
up
i
says
henry
gus
lets
on
to
be
worried
he
says
guy
lifted
him
when
i
looking
of
course
i
knew
that
was
a
lie
and
i
told
him
so
he
says
never
get
henry
back
i
meant
to
give
him
back
to
you
but
after
you
have
talked
to
me
like
that
i
never
give
him
back
i
keep
him
he
says
i
can
find
him
so
there
you
are
gubb
henry
is
in
riverbank
and
i
want
henry
this
story
about
henry
being
stolen
is
a
lie
henry
is
hid
and
gus
smith
knows
where
gubb
looked
at
watts
thoughtfully
now
if
you
one
of
these
fellers
with
a
conscience
said
you
can
send
henry
back
to
the
sheriff
but
i
have
greasy
gus
putting
a
trick
like
this
over
on
me
no
sir
he
shook
hands
with
gubb
again
and
went
out
it
was
fully
fifteen
minutes
before
gus
smith
who
must
have
been
waiting
across
the
street
came
in
he
closed
the
door
and
locked
it
i
saw
old
come
out
of
this
building
he
said
what
did
he
want
he
came
upon
confidential
business
which
ca
be
mentioned
said
gubb
just
so
said
smith
he
wanted
you
to
find
henry
the
educated
pig
now
listen
to
me
i
skipped
out
with
that
pig
to
do
a
favor
and
save
part
of
his
show
for
him
and
that
the
truth
but
he
do
believe
it
not
him
he
called
me
a
thief
and
worse
he
did
he
had
the
nerve
to
say
i
wanted
that
pig
myself
to
start
in
business
with
and
that
a
lie
no
man
can
insult
me
like
that
gubb
look
at
this
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
couple
of
feet
of
whipcord
and
handed
it
to
philo
gubb
what
is
this
asked
gubb
that
all
that
left
of
henry
said
greasy
gus
that
his
total
remains
up
to
date
that
the
rope
i
led
henry
with
after
i
quit
the
wagon
of
a
farmer
that
rode
us
out
of
derlingport
that
cord
was
tied
to
henry
left
hind
foot
look
at
the
end
without
the
knot
was
that
cut
or
was
it
i
most
generally
reserve
my
opinion
until
later
than
right
at
first
said
philo
gubb
all
right
reserve
it
said
greasy
gus
looks
to
me
like
it
was
cut
no
matter
the
main
thing
i
want
is
for
you
to
find
henry
that
under
them
certain
specifications
said
philo
gubb
i
can
take
up
the
case
and
get
right
to
work
onto
it
all
right
then
said
greasy
gus
now
here
what
i
know
about
it
i
got
out
of
derlingport
with
henry
and
when
the
farmer
dumped
us
from
his
wagon
i
hitched
this
whipcord
to
henry
leg
and
drove
him
along
the
road
after
while
i
hit
this
town
of
riverbank
i
thought
maybe
the
police
would
be
looking
for
henry
so
i
took
to
an
alley
instead
of
a
regular
street
and
along
we
came
we
came
down
the
alley
and
of
a
sudden
i
began
to
wonder
what
i
do
with
henry
now
i
got
him
into
town
it
would
look
kind
of
suspicious
for
me
and
henry
to
go
to
a
hotel
know
what
i
do
i
says
to
myself
i
want
to
do
is
to
go
alone
and
rent
a
barn
and
say
i
thinking
of
buying
a
pig
if
i
can
get
a
place
to
keep
him
so
that
what
i
did
you
left
the
pig
alone
in
the
alley
by
itself
asked
philo
gubb
yes
sir
said
smith
i
found
an
alley
fence
that
had
a
staple
in
it
and
i
tied
one
end
of
the
whipcord
to
the
staple
and
went
down
the
alley
to
find
a
barn
i
could
put
henry
in
about
the
fifth
barn
i
tried
i
found
a
place
for
henry
and
then
i
went
back
to
get
him
and
he
was
gone
and
no
clue
asked
gubb
this
tag
end
of
the
rope
said
greasy
gus
and
that
all
i
know
about
where
henry
went
but
my
idee
is
somebody
come
along
and
seen
him
there
and
just
thought
he
have
a
pig
cheap
it
a
pretty
hard
case
to
work
onto
said
gubb
doubtfully
somebody
might
have
come
along
with
a
wagon
and
loaded
him
in
sure
said
smith
no
telling
at
all
that
why
i
come
to
you
if
he
was
where
i
could
fall
over
him
i
would
need
a
detective
would
i
and
if
you
find
henry
i
just
give
you
these
four
bills
i
no
millionaire
but
i
blow
that
much
for
the
satisfaction
of
getting
back
at
watts
is
it
a
go
under
them
certain
specifications
said
gubb
using
the
exact
words
he
had
used
before
i
can
take
up
the
case
and
get
right
to
work
onto
it
smith
shook
hands
to
bind
the
bargain
and
departed
he
had
hardly
disappeared
before
alibaba
singh
opened
the
door
cautiously
put
his
head
inside
and
then
entered
i
thought
that
man
would
stay
forever
he
said
with
annoyance
he
is
in
any
way
interested
in
my
affairs
or
in
the
affairs
of
henry
lippett
is
he
nobody
has
been
here
that
is
interested
into
anything
you
are
interested
into
in
the
slightest
form
or
manner
gubb
assured
him
and
alibaba
singh
sighed
with
relief
you
never
knew
henry
lippett
did
you
he
asked
never
at
all
said
gubb
he
broke
his
neck
said
alibaba
singh
and
it
killed
him
he
hesitated
and
seemed
lost
in
thought
he
drew
himself
together
sharply
it
is
he
exclaimed
with
irritation
and
with
no
connection
with
what
he
had
just
said
i
believe
it
i
i
his
distress
was
great
he
wrung
one
hand
inside
the
other
he
almost
wept
gubb
he
said
since
i
was
here
i
have
been
up
to
lippett
house
again
and
it
is
worse
than
ever
it
ca
be
possible
i
have
the
power
i
know
i
have
the
power
you
ought
to
try
to
explain
yourself
more
plain
to
your
deteckative
said
gubb
i
tell
you
everything
said
alibaba
singh
in
a
sudden
burst
of
confidence
gubb
i
am
an
impostor
i
am
a
fraud
i
am
not
a
hindoo
my
name
is
guffins
james
guffins
i
did
stuff
in
a
bowery
show
i
took
up
this
mystic
yogi
hindoo
stuff
because
i
thought
it
would
pay
and
it
was
easy
to
fool
the
dames
they
fell
for
it
fast
enough
and
i
made
good
money
but
i
no
yogi
i
no
miracle
man
i
could
bring
a
man
back
to
life
in
his
own
form
or
any
other
form
could
i
undoubtedly
hardly
so
said
gubb
glad
to
hear
you
say
it
said
guffins
with
relief
a
man
gets
so
interested
in
his
work
and
there
is
a
lot
you
can
learn
in
books
about
this
hindoo
business
but
of
course
i
could
bring
lippett
back
i
no
spiritualistic
medium
i
could
materialize
the
spirit
of
a
pig
as
he
said
the
word
guffins
shuddered
it
had
come
out
unintentionally
but
it
seemed
to
jar
him
to
the
depth
of
his
being
he
had
evidently
not
meant
to
say
gubb
i
will
be
frank
with
you
i
need
your
help
he
continued
lippett
attended
my
lecture
and
she
became
interested
she
formed
a
class
to
study
yogi
philosophy
we
went
deep
into
it
i
had
to
read
up
one
week
what
i
taught
them
the
next
the
lights
turned
low
and
my
hindoo
costume
helped
of
course
air
of
mystery
strange
perfumes
and
all
that
you
said
you
never
knew
henry
k
lippett
never
at
all
said
gubb
fat
man
said
guffins
he
must
have
been
a
very
fat
man
and
a
hearty
eater
rather
rather
an
eater
he
must
have
lived
to
eat
guffins
sighed
again
of
course
there
was
remuneration
guffins
went
on
for
me
i
mean
to
pay
for
my
time
lippett
was
most
generous
i
her
he
said
angrily
i
could
guarantee
to
materialize
her
dead
husband
i
said
to
her
lippett
we
had
better
not
try
it
my
power
may
be
too
weak
and
think
of
the
risk
he
be
pure
spirit
floating
in
nirvana
and
come
to
us
as
a
pure
spirit
but
what
if
his
life
was
not
all
it
should
have
been
on
earth
what
if
his
spirit
has
passed
into
a
lower
form
as
a
punishment
for
misdeeds
you
will
pardon
me
for
speaking
so
of
him
but
men
are
weak
i
said
he
may
now
be
a
a
bird
of
the
air
it
would
be
a
shock
i
said
see
him
changed
into
a
bird
of
the
air
guffins
paused
and
groaned
but
she
would
have
it
he
went
on
she
would
have
me
make
the
attempt
so
guffins
looked
at
gubb
appealingly
you
believe
i
could
do
it
do
you
he
pleaded
not
in
any
manner
of
means
said
gubb
that
what
i
want
you
to
prove
to
her
said
guffins
why
i
came
to
you
everybody
knows
you
are
a
detective
i
want
you
to
to
get
on
my
trail
you
want
me
to
arrest
you
cried
gubb
with
surprise
i
want
you
to
be
looking
for
me
as
if
you
wanted
to
arrest
me
said
poor
guffins
as
if
you
had
received
word
that
i
was
a
fraud
and
that
you
had
traced
me
to
lippett
you
can
go
there
and
say
i
am
too
late
he
has
escaped
and
then
you
can
tell
her
it
could
be
that
what
could
be
asked
gubb
the
room
was
darkish
said
guffins
the
lights
were
dim
i
stood
in
the
light
of
the
red
globe
and
it
gave
me
a
weird
look
i
held
the
crystal
globe
in
one
hand
and
the
jade
talisman
in
the
other
the
incense
arose
from
the
as
if
out
of
the
empty
air
a
bell
rang
three
times
i
bowed
low
three
times
as
the
bell
rang
and
muttered
the
magic
words
i
made
them
up
as
i
said
them
but
they
sounded
mystic
lippett
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
her
chair
breathless
with
emotion
the
curtains
were
drawn
across
the
door
at
the
back
of
the
room
you
could
have
heard
a
pin
drop
we
were
alone
just
we
two
i
felt
creepy
myself
i
turned
toward
the
curtains
i
said
appear
yes
queried
philo
gubb
guffins
threw
out
both
hands
with
a
gesture
of
utter
despair
a
pig
came
under
the
curtains
he
groaned
a
pig
a
great
fat
pig
the
kind
you
see
at
county
fairs
came
under
the
curtains
and
grunted
twice
it
stood
there
and
raised
its
head
and
grunted
twice
guffins
wrung
his
hands
nervously
it
it
surprised
me
he
said
but
only
for
a
minute
i
said
out
you
beast
and
was
going
to
kick
it
but
lippett
rose
slowly
from
her
chair
she
for
an
instant
and
then
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
she
began
to
weep
knew
it
she
sobbed
knew
it
oh
henry
i
knew
you
ate
too
much
i
told
you
and
you
again
and
again
you
were
making
a
pig
of
yourself
oh
henry
if
you
had
only
been
less
of
a
pig
when
you
were
alive
before
and
what
do
you
think
that
pig
did
what
did
it
do
asked
philo
gubb
it
sat
up
on
its
hind
legs
and
begged
said
guffins
begged
for
food
it
was
awful
lippett
could
stand
it
she
wept
was
always
so
hungry
in
his
other
life
she
said
ca
begin
to
be
stern
with
him
now
but
not
when
he
has
just
come
back
to
me
come
henry
she
went
into
the
continued
guffins
and
henry
or
the
pig
for
it
have
been
henry
followed
her
and
what
do
you
think
it
did
what
asked
gubb
it
went
right
to
the
table
and
climbed
into
a
chair
pigs
do
do
that
do
they
but
you
do
believe
it
could
have
been
henry
do
you
it
got
up
in
the
chair
and
in
it
and
put
its
front
feet
on
the
table
and
grunted
and
lippett
hurried
about
saying
henry
oh
poor
dear
henry
and
brought
a
plate
of
fried
hominy
and
sliced
apple
and
set
it
before
him
and
he
touch
it
he
would
eat
so
lippett
wept
harder
and
got
a
napkin
and
tied
it
around
the
pig
neck
then

he
almost
climbed
into
the
plate
and
gobbled
the
food
down
and
then
he
grunted
for
more
and
lippett
wept
and
said
henry
he
always
did
tie
a
napkin
around
his
neck
he
spilled
his
soup
so
it
henry
it
acts
just
like
henry
he
never
did
anything
at
the
table
but
eat
and
grunt
and
so
said
guffins
sadly
she
thinks
it
henry

up
the
guest
bedroom
for
him
the
idea
of
such
a
notion
said
gubb
illustration
she
thinks
it
henry
she
fixed
up
the
guest
bedroom
for
him
well
that
it
said
guffins
sadly
i
ai
sure
but
it
henry
do

know
that
pig
walks
on
its
hind
feet
like
a
man
she
says

like
henry

asked
gubb
i
told
you
henry

told
you
henry
broke
his
neck
he
fell
down
and
broke
his
neck
in
his
store
he
was
coming
down
the
back
stairs
in
the
dark
and
his
foot
caught
in
a
piece
of
rope
and
he
fell
and
this
pig
came
into
the
parlor
with
a
piece
of
string
on
its
leg
here
the
string
gubb
took
it
from
his
desk
he
took
the
string
greasy
gus
had
left
the
two
ends
joined
perfectly
i
get
you
out
of
this
fix
and
fix
it
so
lippett
wo

that
pig
onto
her
hands
he
said
i

her
what
a
fraud
of
a
faker
you
are
and
it
wo
cost
you
but
dollars
willingly
paid
said
guffins
reaching
into
his
pocket
and
do
you
worry
about
that
pig
being
henry
lippett
said
gubb
that
pig
was
a
stranger
into
riverbank
and
he
went
on
as
if
reading
the
words
from
the
end
of
the
whipcord
it
was
tied
to
the
alley
fence
tied
to
an
iron
staple
he
said
by
a
short
stoutish
man
with
a
ruddish
face
he
took
up
the
other
piece
of
cord
and
looked
at
it
closely
and
the
pig
jerked
the
cord
in
two
and
went
into
the
yard
and
in
at
the
open
door
and
into
the
room
and
what
is
moreover
also
the
pig
is
an
educated
and
its
name
is
henry
and
and
what
asked
guffins
eagerly
if
you
want
to
get
rid
of
the
pig
out
of
lippett
house
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
write
to
the
sheriff
of
derling
county
derlingport
iowa
and
you
need
trouble
yourself
into
it
no
further
great
scott
cried
guffins
and
you
can
tell
all
that
from
that
piece
of
cord
gubb
assumed
a
look
of
wisdom
us
gents
that
is
into
the
deteckative
business
he
said
carelessly
has
to
learn
twelve
correspondence
lessons
before
we
get
our
diplomas
the
deteckative
mind
is
educated
up
to
such
things
buried
bones
when
gubb
went
to
the
house
of
jonas
medderbrook
to
pay
him
the
money
he
had
received
for
solving
the
mystery
of
henry
the
educated
pig
he
found
the
house
closed
locked
and
deserted
and
on
the
door
was
pinned
a
card
that
said
simply
and
in
a
neat
handwriting
gone
to
patagonia
will
be
back
in
one
hundred
years
please
wait
this
was
signed
jonas
medderbrook
but
not
until
the
next
day
did
gubb
learn
from
the
riverbank
eagle
that
medderbrook
had
decamped
after
selling
his
friends
and
neighbors
an
immense
amount
of
stock
in
the
utterly
hopeless
of
which
gubb
had
a
very
large
and
entirely
worthless
quantity
the
departure
of
medderbrook
was
a
great
shock
to
gubb
as
it
seemed
to
indicate
that
serious
complications
in
his
wooing
of
syrilla
might
result
from
it
especially
as
he
had
only
heard
from
syrilla
through
medderbrook
but
disturbed
as
he
was
by
this
fear
he
was
even
more
upset
by
a
telegram
that
came
to
him
direct
that
afternoon
it
was
from
syrilla
herself
alas
it
read
the
worst
has
happened
weighed
myself
this
morning
and
weighed
only
one
hundred
pounds
later
discovered
scales
were
one
hundred
and
five
pounds
out
of
balance
registering
one
hundred
and
five
pounds
too
much
i
can
not
marry
you
now
or
ever
gubby
dear
as
can
not
permit
your
faithful
heart
to
wed
one
who
weighs
five
pounds
less
than
nothing
forever
syrilla
the
blow
was
a
severe
one
to
gubb
as
it
would
have
been
to
any
lover
who
loved
a
of
beauty
only
to
have
her
shrink
to
five
pounds
less
than
nothing
for
several
days
he
remained
locked
in
his
office
hardly
touching
food
and
then
with
a
sad
heart
he
resumed
his
customary
occupations
he
would
never
have
learned
the
truth
about
syrilla
had
it
not
been
for
a
tramp
called
chi
foxy
chi
foxy
made
the
long
walk
from
derlingport
and
night
found
him
on
the
outskirts
of
riverbank
he
begged
a
from
one
of
the
small
houses
and
hunted
a
place
to
spend
the
night
he
found
it
underneath
a
alongside
the
railway
tracks
and
that
it
had
been
used
as
by
other
tramps
was
shown
by
the
heap
of
crushed
straw
the
and
the
remnants
of
a
small
fire
chi
foxy
crawled
in
and
stretched
himself
out
for
a
comfortable
night
he
lighted
his
pipe
loosened
the
laces
of
his
shoes
and
settled
back
for
a
comfortable
smoke
just
outside
the
rear
of
his
sleeping
quarters
ran
the
wire
fence
which
was
also
the
back
fence
of
a
small
piece
of
property
on
which
stood
a
rickety
old
house
the
house
was
devoid
of
paint
but
it
was
a
cheerful
sight
from
where
chi
foxy
reclined
he
had
a
clear
view
of
the
kitchen
window
from
which
the
light
came
in
a
yellow
glow
and
he
could
see
a
woman
cooking
something
in
a
on
a
kitchen
stove
a
man
sat
beside
the
stove
his
elbows
on
his
knees
waiting
for
supper
chi
foxy
almost
decided
to
climb
the
fence
and
knock
at
the
door
of
the
kitchen
at
the
moment
the
woman
took
the
off
the
stove
but
he
was
feeling
well
filled
and
comfortable
and
he
decided
to
wait
and
to
use
the
house
as
his
this
required
no
little
strength
of
character
for
the
perfume
of
fried
veal
chops
was
wafted
to
his
nostrils
but
he
held
himself
in
hand
and
when
he
had
burned
his
pipeful
of
tobacco
he
curled
down
and
went
to
sleep
he
was
awakened
by
the
sound
of
voices
near
at
hand
and
peered
out
between
the
ties
the
night
was
not
dark
the
voices
had
come
from
a
man
and
a
woman
and
as
chi
foxy
watched
them
the
man
began
digging
in
the
sandy
soil
with
a
spade
he
made
quite
a
hole
in
the
soil
and
turned
to
the
woman
hand
me
the
bag
he
said
the
woman
dragged
a
heavy
to
the
edge
of
the
hole
the
man
untwisted
the
neck
of
the
bag
and
it
over
the
hole
there
followed
the
rattle
of
bones
one
striking
against
the
other
and
the
man
handed
the
bag
back
to
the
woman
chi
foxy
peered
eagerly
at
the
hole
he
saw
bones
he
looked
up
at
the
stars
and
saw
it
must
be
well
after
midnight
he
saw
the
man
hastily
spade
the
soft
soil
over
the
bones
saw
him
scatter
loose
dry
over
the
completed
job
and
saw
the
man
and
woman
hurry
back
to
the
dark
house
the
next
morning
chi
foxy
left
his
and
climbed
over
the
wire
fence
he
looked
curiously
at
the
spot
where
the
weird
burial
had
taken
place
and
went
on
toward
the
house
he
knocked
on
the
door
and
it
was
opened
by
the
man
a
tall
lanky
specimen
say
friend
how
about
givin
a
feller

ma
asked
the
man
turning
his
head
got
some
breakfast
for
this
feller
the
woman
looked
toward
the
tramp
she
evidently
decided
in
his
favor
let
him
set
on
the
step
and
i
kin
hand
him
out
some
coffee
and
some
meat
if

she
said
and
chi
foxy
seated
himself
the
breakfast
she
brought
him
on
a
chipped
plate
was
all
he
could
have
desired
there
was
a
half
of
a
veal
cutlet
browned
to
a
nicety
a
portion
of
fried
potatoes
a
thick
slice
of
bread
without
butter
and
a
cup
of
coffee
chi
foxy
ate
and
drank
thanks
folks
he
said
i
wo
forgit
you
and
he
continued
on
his
way
toward
riverbank
so
you
here
said
the
first
policeman
he
met
right
on
time
with
the
first
frosty
breeze

turned
up

went
from

begging
a
but
the
residents
were
colder
than
the
weather
at
the
twelfth
house
he
knocked
on
the
back
door
but
he
was
beginning
to
feel
hopeless
a
thin
streamer
of
smoke
was
issuing
from
the
kitchen
chimney
and
where
there
is
smoke
there
is
food
but
here
instead
of
a
woman
coming
to
the
door
a
man
put
his
face
to
the
kitchen
window
and
looked
out
it
was
the
face
of
a
tall
thin
man
with
a
long
neck
and
prominent
and
as
the
man
peered
out
of
the
window
he
looked
something
like
a
flamingo
he
opened
the
door
come
right
into
the
inside
said
philo
gubb
pleasantly
and
heat

looked
around

brisk
fire
in
the
stove
but
no
sign
of

he
did
me

said
briefly

hey
the
celebrated
detective
considered
chi
foxy
it
was
evident
that
gubb
doubted
the
authenticity
of

in
times
of
necessary
need
he
said
slowly
i
often
assume
onto
me
the
disguise
of

so
complete
that
i

this
here
correspondence
school

i
like
to
see

first
thing
my
old
pard
shermlock
hollums
told
me
was
to
be
anything
but
what
i
was
disguised
to
be
as
long
as
i
was
disguised
to
be

that
right

of
whine
at
him

penny
for
to
hire

bed
that
how
me
and
shermlock
stuck
to
a
disguise
and
shermlock
me
and
him
was
like
twins
we
was
and
yet
when
i
was
in
this
tramp

and
went
up
to

to
go
to
the
hospital
to
get
plastered
up
that
detecting
chi
foxy
looked
at
gubb
but
gubb
did
not
seem
to
have
melted
that
livin
up
to
your
disguise
continued
chi
foxy
me
and
shermlock
when
we
had
on
tramp
disguises
we
tramps
why
i
used
to
go
home
and
my
valet
would
throw
me
downstairs
i
was
so
thoroughly
disguised
and
i
kept
actin
so
trampish
while
i
had
the
disguise
on
that
he
used
to
come
at
me
with
a
golluf
stick
and
whack
me
on
the
head
and
when
i
got
into
my
own
room
i
kept
right
on
being
a
tramp
took
off
my
clothes
still
a
tramp
took
off
my
false
whiskers
still
a
tramp
i
be
there
stark
naked
and
i
still
be
a
tramp
yes
sir
that
the
kind
of
detective
disguising
i
did
and
then
i
take
a
bath

i
was
myself
again

when
scrubbed
myself
in
the
bathtub
i
figured
i
got
rid
of
the
tramp
disguise
right
down
into
the
skin
and
i
be
myself
again
and
not
until
then
he
looked
at
gubb
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
why
i
remember
one
time
he
said
briskly
i
was
asked
to
the
dook
palace
to
a
swell
party
me
and
shermlock
was
both
asked
because
they
knew
one
of
us
would
go
unless
the
other
did
well
sir
i
had
been
out
detecting
in
a
tramp
disguise
that
day
stolen
jools
and
murderers
and
that
sort
of
business
and
i
went
and
took
my
bath
and

up
in
swell
clothes
and
called

automobile
and
when
the
feller
i
hired

come
to
open
the
door
of
the
car
at
the
dook
palace
i
dodged
yes
sir
i
dodged

i
thought
he
was
going
to
hit
me
because
i
had
no
business
in
my
own
automobile
that
was
funny
was
it
so
i
went
up
the
steps
into
the
dook
palace
and
the
gentleman
he
had
to
open
the
door
opened
the
door
and
he
called
out
my
name
and
up
come
the
dookess

of
sluff

they
call
her
but

she
says
to
me
i
mighty
glad
to
see
you
here
we
going
to
have
a
swell
party
and
i
started
to
say
back
something
pleasant
but
what
i
said
was
missus
wo
you
give
a
poor
cove
a
what
seemed
to
be
the
reason
you
said
that
asked
philo
gubb
with
interest
that
what
worried
me
said
chi
foxy
i
did
mean
to
say
it
i
just
said
it
against
my
will
as
you
might
say
but
i
guess
she
thought
i
was
tryin
to
be
smart
for
she
just
says
naughty
mike
and
whistled
to
the
dook
to
come
and
blow
me
off
to
the
feeds
so
the
dook
come
and
led
me
into
the
and
stacked
me
up
against
the
table
for
a
feed
swell
feed
bo
samwiches
till
you
could
rest
ham
samwiches
and
chicken
samwiches
and
tongue
samwiches
and
club
samwiches
and
and
all
kinds
of
samwiches
and
what
did
i
do
i
grabbed
half
a
dozen
of
them
samwiches
and
rammed
them
into
my
pants
pocket
just
like
a
tramp
would
do
it
the
dook
looked
surprised
but
he
begun
to
and
he
slapped
me
on
the
back
and
said
joke
ol
chap
good
joke
so
that
passed
off
all
right
then
i
went
into
the
jool
room
because
the
dook
had
told
me
his
son
the
dookette
or
what
you
might
call
the
little
dookerino
was
in
there
so
in
i
went
and
the
first
thing
i
knew
i
was
hiding
one
of
the
dook
gold
crowns
inside
my
vest
in
a
minute
in
come
the
dook
to
pick
out
a
crown
to
wear
at
dinner
i
thought
you
said
they
had
a
dinner
at
the
table
said
philo
gubb
pshaw
that
was
nothing
but
the
appetizer
said
chi
foxy
well
in
he
come
and
began
lookin
through
his
crowns
for
the
one
he
wanted
and
all
at
once
he
saw
how
my
vest
bulged
out
and
he
knew
by
the
rough
edges
of
the
bulge
it
was
samwiches
because
them
dookal
samwiches
is
all
boneless
so
he
puts
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
he
says
ai
you
carryin
the
joke
a
bit
too
far
that
what
he
says
and
i
wish
you
could
have
heard
how
sad
his
voice
was
he
says
know
me
mike
and
you
know
that
anything
i
got
is
yours
that
crown
you
got
inside
your
vest
for
a
minute
i
did
know
what
to
do
i
was
in
tramp
disguise
and
i
thought
he
would
think
i
was
a
thief
in
real
life
so
i
says
search
me
do
have
to
search
you
he
says
i
can
see
my
favorite
crown
bulging
out
your
vest
do
mean
that
dook
old
chap
i
says
mean
take
me
up
to
your
or
the
bathroom
and
give
me
the
something
wrong
with
me
and
i
know
what
but
some
of
my
tramp
disguise
must
be
sticking
to
me
somewhere
so
we
went
up
to
the
bathroom
and
he
went
over
me
with
this
monocule
he
always
wore
and
then
he
went
over
me
with
a
and
then
he
went
over
me
with
a
microscope
but
he
could
see
a
speck
of
tramp
disguise
on
me
not
a
speck
lookin
i
says
must
be
there
somewhere
dook
i
says
i
would
act
so
pernicious
so
he
begun
again
and
all
at
once
i
hear
him
chuckle
he
was
lookin
in
my
ear
with
the
microscope
what
was
it
asked
philo
gubb
eagerly
a
hair
said
chi
foxy
just
one
hair
it
was
a
hair
out
of
my
tramp
whiskers
that
had
got
in
my
ear
and
the
minute
he
pulled
it
out
i
was
all
right
again
and
no
more
tramp
than
he
was
so
you
see
that
the
way
i
keep
acting
tramp
as
long
as
i
have
even
one
hair
of
tramp
disguise
about
me
come
on
be
a
good
feller
and
let
me
have
half
a
dollar
to
get
some
feeds
with
gubb
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
withdrew
it
again
i
much
admire
to
like
the
way
you
act
right
up
to
the
disguise
he
said
and
it
does
you
proud
but
of
course
when
you
ask
for
fifty
cents
it
nothing
but
part
of
the
disguise
ai
it
now
see
here
bo
said
chi
foxy
earnestly
do
you
go
and
misunderstand
me
i
did
mean
to
be
mistook
that
way
i
want
fifty
cents
i
hungry
i
am
gubb
smiled
approvingly
most
excellent
trampish
disguise
work
he
said
nobody
could
do
it
better
a
real
tramp
could
do
it
better
chi
foxy
frowned
say
he
said
cut
that
out
wo
you
cully
your
head
ai
solid
ivory
is
it
i
starvin
gim
me
fifty
cents
mister
gim
me
a
quarter
if
you
wo
give
me
fifty
come
on
now
be
a
good
feller
a
deteckative
like
you
are
ought
to
need
cents
so
bad
as
that
said
gubb
a
deteckative
acquainted
with
the
knowing
of
a
dook
and
of
sherlock
holmes
do
have
to
beg
chi
foxy
actually
gritted
his
teeth
he
was
angry
with
himself
he
had
talked
too
well
he
had
proved
so
thoroughly
that
he
was
a
detective
that
gubb
would
not
believe
he
was
hungry
see
here
bo
he
said
suddenly
is
this
straight
about
you
being
a
detective
or
is
that
a
bluff
too
philo
gubb
showed
chi
foxy
the
badge
he
had
received
upon
completion
of
his
correspondence
course
of
twelve
lessons
i
the
most
celebrated
and
only
deteckative
in
the
town
of
riverbank
iowa
he
said
seriously
and
you
can
ask
the
sheriff
or
the
chief
of
police
if
you
do
believe
me
i
working
right
now
onto
a
case
of
quite
some
importance
into
which
a
calf
was
stolen
but
up
to
now
the
clues
ai
what
they
should
be
if
you
do
think
i
a
deteckative
you
can
ask
farmer
hopper
he
hired
me
for
to
get
the
capture
of
the
guilty
aforesaid
chi
foxy
studied
gubb
simple
face
and
you
can
arrest
a
feller
and
lodge
him
in
jail
he
asked
i
arrested
many
and
lodged
them
into
jail
gubb
assured
him
well
bo
said
chi
foxy
frankly
i
the
man
you
looking
for
arrest
me
the
tramp
knew
enough
about
arrests
to
know
that
even
a
suspect
when
lodged
in
jail
would
be
fed
and
he
was
hungry
and
getting
hungrier
every
moment
gubb
looked
at
him
with
surprise
i
thought
you
said
you
was
a
deteckative
he
said
i
am
said
chi
foxy
or
i
would
know
i
was
a
criminal
i
detected
it
myself
because
nobody
else
could
even
my
old
friend
shermlock
hollums
could
detect
it
but
i
did
i
a
a
murderer
i
am
there
a
reward
offered
for
me
then
why
do
you
arrest
yourself
and
get
the
reward
asked
gubb
say
said
chi
foxy
with
disgust
it
ca
be
done
i
know
for
tried
i
a
fugitive
that
what
i
am
and
right
behind
me
no
matter
where
i
flee
to
comes
myself
ready
to
grab
me
and
arrest
me
i
chased
myself
all
over
europe
asia
and
africa
and
i
ca
get
away
from
myself
and
i
ca
grab
myself
it
it
just
awful
chi
foxy
wiped
an
imaginary
tear
from
his
eye
and
i
ca
keep
away
from
the
scene
of
my
crime
he
said
i
come
back
here
time
after
time
did
you
do
the
murder
here
asked
gubb
with
increased
interest
illustration
a
deteckative
like
you
are
ought
to
need
cents
so
bad
as
that
that
what
i
did
said
chi
foxy
i
did
it
here
take
me
down
to
the
me
and
you
can
hold
me
all
right
it
somewhat
out
of
the
ordinary
common
run
for
a
feller
to
be
a
deteckative
and
the
criminal
murderer
he
chasing
both
at
once
said
gubb
doubtfully
that
so
ai
it
agreed
chi
foxy
it
looks
that
way
but
facts
are
facts
ai
they
quite
occasionally
they
are
such
agreed
gubb
that
right
said
chi
foxy
and
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
explain
them
you
see
bo
i
was
a
young
feller
when
i
murdered
this
old
miser
what
did
you
say
his
name
was
asked
gubb
smith
said
chi
foxy
promptly
john
smith
and
he
lived
right
here
in
this
town
and
i
murdered
the
old
feller
and
got
away
nobody
cared
much
whether
the
old
feller
was
murdered
or
not
and
much
might
have
been
said
of
it
except
that
the
old
feller
had
a
nephew
his
name
was
smith
peter
p
smith
what
did
he
do
asked
gubb
he
offered
a
reward
of
a
thousand
dollars
said
chi
foxy
it
was
one
of
them
unsolved
mystery
cases
one
of
them
cases
that
never
get
solved
because
no
detective
is
smart
enough
to
solve
it
nobody
knew
who
killed
old
john
smith
but
me
and
i
was
going
around
telling
it
i
should
think
not
said
gubb
no
sir
said
chi
foxy
so
i
was
as
safe
as
a
babe
unborn
i
skipped
up
the
river
to
minneapolis
and
nobody
thought
of
lookin
for
me
because
i
was
suspected
and
then
i
did
a
fool
thing
murderers
always
does
said
gubb
sure
said
chi
foxy
i
thought
i
go
to
new
orleans
it
was
all
right
nice
trip
until
we
got
to
dubuque
and
then
what
happened
the
old
steamboat
blew
up
i
went
sailin
up
in
the
air
like
one
of
these
here
skyrockets
i
did
and
when
i
come
down
i
lit
head
first
it
is
a
remarkable
wonder
it
did
kill
you
to
death
said
gubb
ai
it
said
chi
foxy
but
it
did
worse
than
kill
me
it
knocked
my
senses
out
of
me
when
i
come
to
i
did
know
what
had
happened
i
did
remember
a
thing
out
of
my
past
not
a
thing
i
was
like
a
newborn
babe
i
did
have
an
idea
or
a
memory
left
in
me
when
they
picked
me
up
and
i
opened
my
eyes
i
could
just
say
and
and
things
like
that
and
i
did
know
who
i
was
or
where
been
or
anything
so
some
kind
folks
took
me
and
sent
me
to
and
i
started
in
to
learn
my
and
things
like
that
i
learned
fast
and
pretty
soon
i
was
in
the
high
school
and
pretty
soon
i
graduated
and
the
name
i
graduated
under
was
mike
higgs
higgs
being
the
name
of
the
family
that
adopted
me
mike
higgs
repeated
gubb
trying
to
remember
a
celebrated
detective
of
that
name
yes
said
chi
foxy
they
named
me
mike
after
the
old
of
the
family
he
was
a
butcher
and
they
wanted
me
to
be
a
butcher
but
i
wanted
to
be
a
detective
so
higgs
he
lent
me
enough
money
to
go
to
london
and
take
lessons
in
detecting
from
shermlock
hollums
and
i
did
he
says
to
me
when
i
finished
the
course
i
hate
to
say
it
but
i
ca
call
you
a
rival
you
so
far
ahead
of
me
in
detective
knowledge
that
i
like
a
child
beside
you
that
what
my
old
friend
and
teacher
shermlock
hollums
says
to
me
that
was
exceedingly
high
praising
from
one
so
great
said
gubb
you
bet
it
was
said
chi
foxy
so
one
day
shermlock
says
to
me
you
so
good
at
this
detecting
work
why
do
you
try
to
solve
the
great
mystery
that
i
says
the
greatest
unsolved
mystery
of
the
world
he
says
mystery
of
the
riverbank
iowa
miser
so
he
told
me
what
he
knew
about
it
continued
chi
foxy
and
i
set
to
work
i
come
here
to
riverbank
to
hunt
up
a
clue
and
i
found
just
one
clue
what
was
it
asked
philo
gubb
it
was
a
speck
of
red
pepper
no
bigger
than
the
point
of
a
pin
said
chi
foxy
crushed
into
the
carpet
by
the
old
miser
bed
where
he
had
been
killed
i
picked
up
the
speck
of
red
pepper
and
microscoped
it
and
i
saw
that
along
one
edge
it
was
sort
of
brown
where
it
had
been
burned
a
little
have
you
got
it
now
asked
gubb
got
it
said
chi
foxy
i
should
say
not
while
i
was
lookin
at
it
a
breeze
come
and
blowed
it
away
and
i
never
saw
it
again
but
that
was
enough
for
me
pepper
i
says
burned
and
i
began
to
tremble
why
i
never
was
able
to
get
smoking
tobacco
strong
enough
to
suit
me
and
to
make
it
taste
snappy
i
always
put
a
little
red
pepper
in
my
pipe
i
turned
as
white
as
a
sheet
pepper
partly
burned
i
says
to
myself
in
the
world
but
me
puts
red
pepper
in
his
tobacco
well
sir
i
started
tracing
myself
back
and
i
found
out
i
was
the
murderer
and
i
was
the
detective
after
the
murderer
i
was
everybody
concerned
in
a
moment
i
was
overcome
by
criminal
fear
and
i
fled
i
fled
all
over
europe
asia
and
africa
and
wherever
i
went
i
was
right
after
myself
ready
to
arrest
me
chi
foxy
paused
and
glanced
at
gubb
questioningly
with
a
solemn
face
the
great
correspondence
school
detective
blinked
his
eyes
at
chi
foxy
so
now
arrest
me
said
chi
foxy
philo
gubb
rubbed
his
chin
i
like
to
favor
you
by
so
doing
jones
he
said
for
i
can
easy
see
higgs
that
you
ca
arrest
yourself
but
it
is
against
the
instructions
in
lesson
six
of
the
rising
sun
correspondence
school
of
deteckating
for
a
graduate
to
arrest
a
man
without
a
good
clue
and
the
only
clue
you
had
was
blowed
away
for
a
moment
this
seemed
to
annoy
chi
foxy
but
his
face
suddenly
brightened
clue
he
said
say
friend
i
would
ask
you
to
arrest
me
on
any
such
clue
as
a
speck
of
red
pepper
no
sir
but
i
got
a
clue
that
mean
something
i
can
tell
you
right
where
i
buried
that
old
miser
bones
i
can
you
go
up
the
river
road
until
you
come
to
a
on
the
railway
and
just
back
of
the
is
a
old
and
unpainted
all
right
right
in
that
yard
close
to
the
railway
fence
the
bones
is
buried
now
you
turn
me
over
to
the
law
and
you
go
up
there
we
best
go
up
there
immediately
first
before
anything
else
said
philo
gubb
starting
to
remove
his
apron
putting
off
clues
until
sometime
else
is
against
paragraph
four
lesson
one
if
you
come
up
there
with
me
look
here
said
chi
foxy
will
you
buy
me
a
feed
on
the
way
up
if
i
go
with
you
quite
certainly
sure
said
gubb
and
so
it
was
agreed
the
detective
and
the
stopped
at
hank
restaurant
and
chi
foxy
ate
a
heavy
meal
and
then
led
the
way
to
the
and
pointed
over
the
wire
fence
to
the
spot
where
the
bones
of
the
murdered
miser
were
supposed
to
repose
right
there
he
said
but
when
gubb
had
climbed
the
fence
and
had
turned
to
look
for
chi
foxy
the
late
was
gone
gubb
face
turned
red
but
as
he
hung
his
head
in
shame
he
noticed
that
the
ground
at
his
feet
had
lately
been
spaded
he
stooped
to
look
at
it
and
then
walked
to
the
house
and
knocked
a
lanky
man
came
to
the
door
and
a
woman
peered
at
gubb
from
behind
the
man
i
hope
you
pardon
said
gubb
politely
but
my
name
is
gubb
deteckative
and
and
i
looking
up
a
case
might
i
trouble
you
for
the
loan
of
a
spade
or
shovel
what
you
want
with
it
asked
the
man
gruffly
to
dig
said
gubb
the
man
reluctantly
handed
gubb
a
spade
on
which
there
were
still
traces
of
soft
sandy
soil
gubb
walked
to
the
rear
of
the
yard
and
jabbed
the
spade
into
the
soft
soil
it
struck
something
hard
in
a
moment
or
two
gubb
had
the
evidences
of
crime
completely
uncovered
there
were
bones
buried
there
many
bones
gubb
looked
up
and
wiped
his
brow
then
he
looked
down
at
the
bones
one
was
a
skull
gubb
stared
at
it
it
was
indeed
a
skull
but
it
was
the
skull
of
a
calf
all
the
bones
were
calf
bones
not
bones
of
the
human
calf
but
bones
of
the
veal
calf
gubb
turned
his
head
and
saw
the
long
lanky
man
approaching
all
right
said
the
long
lanky
man

a
detective

that
close

the
lanky

but

wish

how
you

i
was
the
calf
thief
gubb
smiled
an
inscrutable
smile
a
deteckative
acquires
dexterity
in
the
way
of
capturing
up
the
criminal
classes
he
said
with
oracular
yet
modest
simplicity
the
next
day
when
gubb
returned
to
his
job
he
found
chi
foxy
waiting
for
him
boss
he
said
with
a
laugh
i
showed
you
where
that
murdered
bones
was
buried
wo
you
stake
me
to
a
meal
are
you
hungry
again
asked
gubb
hungry
said
chi
foxy
i
so
hungry
that
i
feel
like
a
living
skeleton
i
so
hungry
that
a
square
meal
would
make
me
feel
like
syrilla
that
fat
lady
i
seen
at
derlingport
a
couple
of
days
ago
what
that
you
remarked
about
asked
gubb
pinning
chi
foxy
with
his
eye
did
i
understand
the
meaning
of
what
you
said
was
that
you
saw
a
fat
lady
named
syrilla
at
derlingport
said
chi
foxy
a
swell
guy
named
medderbrook
give
me
a
meal
and
a
ticket
to
the
big
show
it
was
a
performance
so
to
say
special
attraction
bo
you
have
laughed
your
head
off
this
here
syrilla
fat
lady
got
married
to
the
living
skeleton
in
the
middle
ring
and
she
had
the
snake
charmer
for
a
bridesmaid
say
you
have
laughed
but
gubb
did
not
laugh
he
never
laughed
again
philo
gubb
greatest
case
philo
gubb
wrapped
in
his
bathrobe
went
to
the
door
of
the
room
that
was
the
headquarters
of
his
business
of
and
decorating
as
well
as
the
office
of
his
detective
business
and
opened
the
door
a
crack
it
was
still
early
in
the
morning
but
gubb
was
a
modest
man
and
lest
any
one
should
see
him
in
his
scanty
attire
he
peered
through
the
crack
of
the
door
before
he
stepped
hastily
into
the
hall
and
captured
his
copy
of
the
riverbank
daily
eagle
when
he
had
secured
the
still
damp
newspaper
he
returned
to
his
cot
bed
and
spread
himself
out
to
read
comfortably
it
was
a
hot
iowa
morning
business
was
so
slack
that
if
gubb
had
not
taken
out
his
set
of
eight
varieties
of
false
whiskers
daily
and
brushed
them
carefully
the
moths
would
have
been
able
to
devour
them
at
leisure
gubb
opened
the
eagle
the
first
words
that
met
his
eye
caused
him
to
sit
upright
on
his
cot
at
the
top
of
the
first
column
of
the
first
page
were
the
headlines
mysterious
death
of
henry
smitz
body
found
in
mississippi
river
by
boatman
early
this
foul
play
suspected
gubb
unfolded
the
paper
and
read
the
item
under
the
headlines
with
the
most
intense
interest
foul
play
meant
the
possibility
of
an
opportunity
to
put
to
use
once
more
the
precepts
of
the
course
of
twelve
lessons
and
with
them
fresh
in
his
mind
detective
gubb
was
eager
to
undertake
the
solution
of
any
mystery
that
riverbank
could
furnish
this
was
the
article
just
as
we
go
to
press
we
receive
word
through
policeman
michael
that
the
and
boatman
samuel
fliggis
long
sam
while
dredging
for
mussels
last
night
just
below
the
bridge
recovered
the
body
of
henry
smitz
late
of
this
place
smitz
had
been
missing
for
three
days
and
his
wife
had
been
greatly
worried
brownson
of
the
brownson
packing
company
by
whom
he
was
employed
admitted
that
smitz
had
been
missing
for
several
days
the
body
was
found
sewed
in
a
sack
foul
play
is
suspected
i
should
think
foul
play
would
be
suspected
exclaimed
philo
gubb
if
a
man
was
sewed
into
a
bag
and
deposited
into
the
mississippi
river
until
dead
he
propped
the
paper
against
the
foot
of
the
cot
bed
and
was
still
reading
when
some
one
knocked
on
his
door
he
wrapped
his
bathrobe
carefully
about
him
and
opened
the
door
a
young
woman
with
eyes
stood
in
the
doorway
p
gubb
she
asked
i
sorry
to
disturb
you
so
early
in
the
morning
gubb
but
i
could
sleep
all
night
i
came
on
a
matter
of
business
as
you
might
say
there
a
couple
of
things
i
want
you
to
do
or
deteckating
asked
gubb
both
said
the
young
woman
my
name
is
smitz
emily
smitz
my
husband
i
aware
of
the
knowledge
of
your
loss
said
the
detective
gently
lots
of
people
know
of
it
said
smitz
i
guess
everybody
knows
of
it
i
told
the
police
to
try
to
find
henry
so
it
is
no
secret
and
i
want
you
to
come
up
as
soon
as
you
get
dressed
and
paper
my
bedroom
gubb
looked
at
the
young
woman
as
if
he
thought
she
had
gone
insane
under
the
burden
of
her
woe
and
then
i
want
you
to
find
henry
she
said
because
i
heard
you
can
do
so
well
in
the
detecting
line
gubb
suddenly
realized
that
the
poor
creature
did
not
yet
know
the
full
extent
of
her
loss
he
gazed
down
upon
her
with
pity
in
his
eyes
i
know
you
think
it
strange
the
young
woman
went
on
that
i
should
ask
you
to
paper
a
bedroom
first
when
my
husband
is
lost
but
if
he
is
gone
it
is
because
i
was
a
mean
stubborn
thing
we
never
quarreled
in
our
lives
gubb
until
i
picked
out
the
for
our
bedroom
and
henry
said
parrots
and
and
tropical
flowers
that
were
as
big
as
umbrellas
would
look
awful
on
our
bedroom
wall
so
i
said
he
had
anything
but
low
dutch
taste
and
he
got
mad
right
have
it
your
own
way
he
said
and
i
went
and
had
skaggs
put
the
paper
on
the
wall
and
the
next
day
henry
did
come
home
at
all
if
i
thought
henry
would
take
it
that
way
i
rather
had
the
wall
bare
gubb
i
cried
and
cried
and
last
night
i
made
up
my
mind
it
was
all
my
fault
and
that
when
henry
came
home
he
find
a
decent
paper
on
the
wall
i
do
mind
telling
you
gubb
that
when
the
paper
was
on
the
wall
it
looked
worse
than
it
looked
in
the
roll
it
looked
crazy
yes
said
gubb
it
often
does
but
however
something
you
ought
to
know
right
away
about
henry
the
young
woman
stared
at
gubb
for
a
moment
she
turned
as
white
as
her
shirtwaist
henry
is
dead
she
cried
and
collapsed
into
gubb
long
thin
arms
gubb
the
inert
form
of
the
young
woman
in
his
arms
glanced
around
with
a
startled
gaze
he
stood
miserably
not
knowing
what
to
do
when
suddenly
he
saw
policeman
coming
toward
him
down
the
hall
policeman
was
leading
by
the
arm
a
man
whose
wrists
bore
clanking
handcuffs
what
this
now
asked
the
policeman
none
too
gently
as
he
saw
the
bathrobed
gubb
holding
the
fainting
woman
in
his
arms
i
am
exceedingly
glad
you
have
come
said
gubb
the
only
meaning
into
it
is
that
this
is
smitz
fainted
onto
me
against
my
will
and
wishes
i
was
only
askin
said
policeman
politely
enough
you
should
ask
such
things
until
you
asked
to
ask
said
gubb
after
looking
into
gubb
room
to
see
that
there
was
no
easy
means
of
escape
pushed
his
prisoner
into
the
room
and
took
the
limp
form
of
smitz
from
gubb
who
entered
the
room
and
closed
the
door
i
may
as
well
say
what
i
want
to
say
right
now
said
the
handcuffed
man
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
with
gubb
i
heard
of
detective
gubb
off
and
on
many
a
time
and
as
soon
as
i
got
into
this
trouble
i
said
the
man
that
can
get
me
out
if
any
one
can
my
name
is
herman
wiggins
glad
to
meet
you
said
gubb
slipping
his
long
legs
into
his
trousers
and
i
give
you
my
word
for
what
it
is
worth
continued
wiggins
that
i
as
innocent
of
this
crime
as
the
babe
unborn
what
crime
asked
gubb
why
killing
hen
smitz
what
crime
did
you
think
said
wiggins
do
i
look
like
a
man
that
would
go
and
murder
a
man
just
because
he
hesitated
and
gubb
who
was
slipping
his
suspenders
over
his
bony
shoulders
looked
at
wiggins
with
keen
eyes
well
just
because
him
and
me
had
words
in
fun
said
wiggins
i
leave
it
to
you
ca
a
man
say
words
in
fun
once
in
a
while
certainly
sure
said
gubb
i
guess
so
said
wiggins
anybody
know
a
man
do
mean
all
he
says
when
i
went
and
told
hen
smitz
i
murder
him
as
sure
as
green
apples
grow
on
a
tree
i
was
just
fooling
but
this
fool
policeman
mr
yes
they
gave
him
this
hen
smitz
case
to
look
into
and
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
arrest
me
for
murder
nervy
i
call
it
policeman
opened
the
door
a
crack
and
peeked
in
seeing
gubb
well
along
in
his
dressing
operations
he
opened
the
door
wider
and
assisted
smitz
to
a
chair
she
was
still
limp
but
she
was
a
brave
little
woman
and
was
trying
to
control
her
sobs
through
asked
wiggins
if
you
are
come
along
back
to
jail
now
do
talk
to
me
in
that
tone
of
voice
said
wiggins
angrily
no
i
not
through
you
do
know
how
to
treat
a
gentleman
like
a
gentleman
and
never
did
he
turned
to
gubb
the
long
and
short
of
it
is
this
i
arrested
for
the
murder
of
hen
smitz
and
i
did
murder
him
and
i
want
you
to
take
my
case
and
get
me
out
of
jail
ah
stuff
exclaimed
you
murdered
him
and
you
know
you
did
what
the
use
talkin
smitz
leaned
forward
in
her
chair
murdered
henry
she
cried
he
never
murdered
henry
i
murdered
him
now
said
politely
i
hate
to
contradict
a
lady
but
you
never
murdered
him
at
all
this
man
here
murdered
him
and
got
the
proof
on
him
i
murdered
him
cried
smitz
again
i
drove
him
out
of
his
right
mind
and
made
him
kill
himself
nothing
of
the
sort
declared
this
man
wiggins
murdered
him
i
did
not
exclaimed
wiggins
indignantly
some
other
man
did
it
it
seemed
a
deadlock
for
each
was
quite
positive
gubb
looked
from
one
to
the
other
doubtfully
all
right
take
me
back
to
jail
said
wiggins
you
look
up
the
case
gubb
that
all
i
came
here
for
will
you
do
it
dig
into
it
hey
i
most
certainly
shall
be
glad
to
so
do
said
gubb
at
the
regular
terms
led
his
prisoner
away
for
a
few
minutes
smitz
sat
silent
her
hands
clasped
staring
at
the
floor
then
she
looked
up
into
gubb
eyes
you
will
work
on
this
case
gubb
wo
you
she
begged
i
have
a
little
money
i
give
it
all
to
have
you
do
your
best
it
is
cruel
cruel
to
have
that
poor
man
suffer
under
the
charge
of
murder
when
i
know
so
well
henry
killed
himself
because
i
was
cross
with
him
you
can
prove
he
killed
himself
that
it
was
my
fault
you
will
the
way
the
deteckative
profession
operates
onto
a
case
said
gubb
is
to
go
to
work
to
prove
anything
particularly
especial
it
finds
a
clue
or
clues
and
follows
them
to
where
they
lead
to
that
i
shall
be
willing
to
do
that
is
all
i
could
ask
said
smitz
gratefully
arising
from
her
seat
with
difficulty
she
walked
tremblingly
to
the
door
gubb
assisted
her
down
the
stairs
and
it
was
not
until
she
was
gone
that
he
remembered
that
she
did
not
know
the
body
of
her
husband
had
been
found
sewed
in
a
sack
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
young
husbands
have
been
known
to
quarrel
with
their
wives
over
matters
as
trivial
as
bedroom
they
have
even
been
known
to
leave
home
for
several
days
at
a
time
when
angry
in
extreme
cases
they
have
even
been
known
to
seek
death
at
their
own
hands
but
it
is
not
at
all
usual
for
a
young
husband
to
leave
home
for
several
days
and
then
in
cold
blood
sew
himself
in
a
sack
and
jump
into
the
river
in
the
first
place
there
are
easier
ways
of
terminating
one
life
in
the
second
place
a
man
can
jump
into
the
river
with
perfect
ease
without
going
to
the
trouble
of
sewing
himself
in
a
sack
and
in
the
third
place
it
is
exceedingly
difficult
for
a
man
to
sew
himself
into
a
sack
it
is
almost
impossible
to
sew
himself
into
a
sack
a
man
must
have
no
little
skill
and
he
must
have
a
large
roomy
sack
he
takes
let
us
say
a
threaded
with
a
good
length
of
twine
he
steps
into
the
sack
and
pulls
it
up
over
his
head
he
then
reaches
above
his
head
holding
the
mouth
of
the
sack
together
with
one
hand
while
he
sews
with
the
other
hand
in
hot
anger
this
would
be
quite
impossible
philo
gubb
thought
of
all
this
as
he
looked
through
his
disguises
selecting
one
suitable
for
the
work
he
had
in
hand
he
had
just
decided
that
the
most
appropriate
disguise
would
be
number
undertaker
and
had
picked
up
the
close
black
wig
and
long
drooping
mustache
when
he
had
another
thought
given
a
bag
sufficiently
loose
to
permit
free
motion
of
the
hands
and
arms
and
a
man
even
in
hot
anger
might
sew
himself
in
a
man
intent
on
suicidally
bagging
himself
would
sew
the
mouth
of
the
bag
shut
and
would
then
cut
a
slit
in
the
front
of
the
bag
large
enough
to
crawl
into
he
would
then
crawl
into
the
bag
and
sew
up
the
slit
which
would
be
immediately
in
front
of
his
hands
it
could
be
done
philo
gubb
chose
from
his
wardrobe
a
black
frock
coat
and
a
silk
hat
with
a
wide
band
of
crape
he
carefully
locked
his
door
and
went
down
to
the
street
on
a
day
as
hot
as
this
day
promised
to
be
a
frock
coat
and
a
silk
hat
could
be
nothing
but
distressingly
uncomfortable
between
his
door
and
the
corner
eight
various
citizens
spoke
to
philo
gubb
calling
him
by
name
in
fact
riverbank
was
as
accustomed
to
seeing
gubb
in
disguise
as
out
of
disguise
and
while
a
few
children
might
be
interested
by
the
sight
of
detective
gubb
in
disguise
the
older
citizens
thought
no
more
of
it
as
a
rule
than
of
seeing
banker
jennings
appear
in
a
pink
shirt
one
day
and
a
blue
striped
one
the
next
no
one
ever
accused
banker
jennings
of
trying
to
hide
his
identity
by
a
change
of
shirts
and
no
one
imagined
that
gubb
was
trying
to
disguise
himself
when
he
put
on
a
disguise
they
considered
it
a
mere
business
custom
just
as
a
butcher
tied
on
a
white
apron
before
he
went
behind
his
counter
this
was
why
instead
of
wondering
who
the
tall
stranger
might
be
banker
jennings
greeted
philo
gubb
cheerfully
ah
gubb
he
said
so
you
are
going
to
work
on
this
smitz
case
are
you
glad
of
it
and
wish
you
luck
hope
you
place
the
crime
on
the
right
man
and
get
him
the
full
penalty
let
me
tell
you
nothing
in
this
rumor
of
smitz
being
short
of
money
we
did
lend
him
money
but
we
never
pressed
him
for
it
we
never
even
asked
him
for
interest
i
told
him
a
dozen
times
he
could
have
as
much
more
from
us
as
he
wanted
within
reason
whenever
he
wanted
it
and
that
he
could
pay
me
when
his
invention
was
on
the
market
no
report
of
news
of
any
such
rumor
has
as
yet
come
to
my
hearing
said
gubb
but
since
you
mention
it
i
take
it
for
less
than
it
is
worth
and
that
less
than
nothing
said
the
banker
have
you
any
clue
i
on
my
way
to
find
one
at
the
present
moment
of
time
said
gubb
well
let
me
give
you
a
pointer
said
the
banker
get
a
line
on
herman
wiggins
or
some
of
his
crew
understand
do
say
i
said
a
word
i
do
want
to
be
brought
into
this
but
smitz
was
afraid
of
wiggins
and
his
crew
he
told
me
so
he
said
wiggins
had
threatened
to
murder
him
wiggins
is
at
present
in
the
custody
of
the
county
jail
for
killing
smitz
with
intent
to
murder
him
said
gubb
oh
then
then
it
all
settled
said
the
banker
they
proved
it
on
him
i
thought
they
would
well
i
suppose
you
got
to
do
your
little
bit
of
detecting
just
the
same
got
to
air
the
camphor
out
of
the
false
hair
eh
the
banker
waved
a
cheerful
hand
at
gubb
and
passed
into
his
banking
institution
detective
gubb
cordially
greeted
by
his
many
friends
and
admirers
passed
on
down
the
main
street
and
by
the
time
he
reached
the
street
that
led
to
the
river
he
was
followed
by
a
large
and
growing
group
intent
on
the
pleasant
occupation
of
watching
a
detective
detect
as
gubb
walked
toward
the
river
other
citizens
joined
the
group
but
all
kept
a
respectful
distance
behind
him
when
gubb
reached
river
street
and
his
false
mustache
fell
off
the
interest
of
the
audience
stopped
short
three
paces
behind
him
and
stood
until
he
had
rescued
the
mustache
and
once
more
placed
its
wires
in
his
nostrils
then
when
he
moved
forward
again
they
too
moved
forward
never
perhaps
in
the
history
of
crime
was
a
detective
favored
with
a
more
respectful
gallery
on
the
edge
of
the
river
gubb
found
long
sam
fliggis
the
mussel
dredger
seated
on
an
empty
with
his
own
audience
ranged
before
him
listening
while
he
told
for
the
fortieth
time
the
story
of
his
finding
of
the
body
of
smitz
as
philo
gubb
approached
long
sam
ceased
speaking
and
his
audience
and
gubb
gallery
merged
into
one
great
circle
which
respectfully
looked
and
listened
while
gubb
questioned
the
mussel
dredger
illustration
he
was
followed
by
a
large
and
growing
group
intent
on
watching
a
detective
detect
suicide
said
long
sam
scoffingly
why
he
wa
no
more
a
suicide
than
i
am
right
now
he
was
murdered
or
wa
nothin
i
dredged
up
some
suicides
in
my
day
and
some
of
had
stones
tied
to
to
make
sure
they
sink
and
some
thought
they
sink
without
no
ballast
but
nary
one
of
ever
sewed
himself
into
a
bag
and
i
give
my
word
he
said
positively
that
hen
smitz
could
have
sewed
himself
into
that
burlap
bag
unless
some
one
done
the
sewing
then
the
feller
that
did
it
was
an
and
the
way
i
look
at
it
is
that
an
is
jest
the
same
as
a
murderer
the
crowd
murmured
approval
but
gubb
held
up
his
hand
for
silence
in
certain
kinds
of
burlap
bags
it
is
possibly
probable
a
man
could
sew
himself
into
it
said
gubb
and
the
crowd
seeing
the
logic
of
the
remark
applauded
gently
but
feelingly
you
ai
seen
the
way
he
was
sewed
up
said
long
sam
or
you
would
talk
like
that
i
have
yet
took
a
look
admitted
gubb
but
i
aim
so
to
do
immediately
after
i
find
a
clue
onto
which
to
work
up
my
case
an
deteckative
ca
set
forth
to
work
until
he
has
a
clue
that
being
a
rule
of
the
game
what
kind
of
a
clue
was
you
lookin
for
asked
long
sam
what
a
clue
anyway
a
clue
said
gubb
is
almost
anything
connected
with
the
late
lamented
but
generally
something
that
nobody
but
a
deteckative
would
think
had
anything
to
do
with
anything
whatsoever
not
infrequently
often
it
is
a
button
well
i
got
no
button
except
them
that
is
sewed
onto
me
said
long
sam
but
if
this
here
will
do
any
good
he
brought
from
his
pocket
the
point
of
a
heavy
and
laid
it
in
philo
gubb
palm
gubb
looked
at
it
carefully
in
the
eye
of
the
needle
still
remained
a
few
inches
of
twine
i
cut
that
the
burlap
he
was
sewed
up
in
volunteered
long
sam
i
thought
i
keep
it
as
a
sort
of
nice
little
souvenir
like
it
back
again
when
you
do
need
it
for
a
clue
no
more
certainly
sure
agreed
gubb
and
he
examined
the
needle
carefully
there
are
two
kinds
of
in
general
use
in
both
the
point
of
the
needle
is
curved
to
facilitate
pushing
it
into
and
out
of
a
closely
filled
sack
in
both
the
curved
portion
is
somewhat
flattened
so
that
the
thumb
and
finger
may
secure
a
firm
grasp
to
pull
the
needle
through
but
in
one
style
the
eye
is
at
the
end
of
the
shaft
while
in
the
other
it
is
near
the
point
this
needle
was
like
neither
the
eye
was
midway
of
the
shaft
the
needle
was
pointed
at
each
end
and
the
curved
portions
were
not
flattened
gubb
noticed
another
thing
the
twine
was
not
the
ordinary
loosely
twisted
hemp
twine
but
a
hard
smooth
cotton
cord
like
carpet
warp
thank
you
said
gubb
and
now
i
will
go
elsewhere
to
investigate
to
a
further
extent
and
it
is
not
necessarily
imperative
that
everybody
should
accompany
along
with
me
if
they
do
want
to
but
everybody
did
want
to
it
seemed
long
sam
and
his
audience
joined
gubb
gallery
and
with
a
dozen
or
so
newcomers
they
followed
gubb
at
a
decent
distance
as
he
walked
toward
the
plant
of
the
brownson
packing
company
which
stood
on
the
riverbank
some
two
blocks
away
it
was
here
henry
smitz
had
worked
six
or
eight
buildings
of
various
sizes
the
largest
of
which
stood
immediately
on
the
river
edge
together
with
the
yards
or
pens
all
enclosed
by
a
high
board
fence
constituted
the
plant
of
the
packing
company
and
as
gubb
appeared
at
the
gate
the
watchman
there
stood
aside
to
let
him
enter
gubb
he
said
pleasantly
i
been
sort
of
expecting
you
always
right
on
the
job
when
there
crime
being
done
ai
you
you
find
merkel
and
brill
and
jokosky
and
the
rest
of
wiggins
crew
in
the
main
building
and
i
guess
they
tell
you
just
what
they
told
the
police
they
hate
it
but
what
else
can
they
say
it
the
truth
what
is
the
truth
asked
gubb
that
wiggins
was
dead
sore
at
hen
smitz
said
the
watchman
that
wiggins
told
hen
he
do
for
him
if
he
lost
them
their
jobs
like
he
said
he
would
that
the
truth
gubb
his
admiring
followers
were
halted
at
the
gate
by
the
watchman
entered
the
large
building
and
inquired
his
way
to
wiggins
department
he
found
it
on
the
side
of
the
building
toward
the
river
and
on
the
ground
floor
on
one
side
the
vast
room
led
into
the
refrigerating
room
of
the
company
on
the
other
it
opened
upon
a
long
but
narrow
dock
that
ran
the
width
of
the
building
along
the
outer
edge
of
the
dock
were
tied
two
barges
and
into
these
barges
some
of
wiggins
crew
were
dumping
mutton
not
legs
of
mutton
but
entire
sheep
neatly
sewed
in
burlap
the
large
room
was
the
packing
and
shipping
room
and
the
work
of
wiggins
crew
was
that
of
sewing
the
slaughtered
and
refrigerated
sheep
carcasses
in
burlap
for
shipment
bales
of
burlap
stood
against
one
wall
strands
of
hemp
twine
ready
for
the
needle
hung
from
pegs
in
the
wall
and
the
posts
that
supported
the
floor
above
the
contiguity
of
the
refrigerating
room
gave
the
room
a
pleasantly
cool
atmosphere
gubb
glanced
sharply
around
here
was
the
burlap
here
were
needles
here
was
twine
yonder
was
the
river
into
which
hen
smitz
had
been
thrown
he
glanced
across
the
narrow
dock
at
the
blue
river
as
his
eye
returned
he
noticed
one
of
the
men
carefully
sweeping
the
dock
with
a
broom
sweeping
fragments
of
glass
into
the
river
as
the
men
in
the
room
watched
him
curiously
gubb
picked
up
a
piece
of
burlap
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
wrapped
a
strand
of
twine
around
his
finger
and
pocketed
the
twine
examined
the
needles
stuck
in
improvised
made
by
boring
gimlet
holes
in
the
wall
and
then
walked
to
the
dock
and
picked
up
one
of
the
pieces
of
glass
clues
he
remarked
and
gave
his
attention
to
the
work
of
questioning
the
men
although
manifestly
reluctant
they
honestly
admitted
that
wiggins
had
more
than
once
threatened
hen
smitz
that
he
hated
hen
smitz
with
the
hatred
of
a
man
who
has
been
threatened
with
the
loss
of
his
job
gubb
learned
that
hen
smitz
had
been
the
foreman
for
the
entire
building
a
sort
of
autocrat
with
as
wiggins
crew
informed
him
an
easy
job
he
had
only
to
see
that
the
crews
in
the
building
turned
out
more
work
this
year
than
they
did
last
year
had
been
his
motto
they
said
and
they
hated
gubb
gallery
was
awaiting
him
at
the
gate
and
its
members
were
in
a
heated
discussion
as
to
what
gubb
had
been
doing
they
ceased
at
once
when
he
appeared
and
fell
in
behind
him
as
he
walked
away
from
the
packing
house
and
toward
the
undertaking
establishment
of
holworthy
bartman
on
the
main
street
here
joining
the
curious
group
already
assembled
the
gallery
was
forced
to
wait
while
gubb
entered
his
task
was
an
unpleasant
but
necessary
one
he
must
visit
the
little
morgue
at
the
back
of
bartman
establishment
the
body
of
poor
hen
smitz
had
not
yet
been
removed
from
the
bag
in
which
it
had
been
found
and
it
was
to
the
bag
gubb
gave
his
closest
attention
the
bag
in
order
that
the
body
might
be
identified
had
not
been
ripped
but
had
been
cut
and
not
a
stitch
had
been
severed
it
did
not
take
gubb
a
moment
to
see
that
hen
smitz
had
not
been
sewed
in
a
bag
at
all
he
had
been
sewed
in
burlap
burlap
yard
goods
to
use
a
shopkeeper
term
and
it
was
burlap
identical
with
that
used
by
wiggins
and
his
crew
it
was
no
loose
bag
of
burlap
but
a
wrapping
of
burlap
a
cocoon
of
burlap
that
had
been
drawn
tight
around
the
body
as
burlap
is
drawn
tight
around
the
carcass
of
sheep
for
shipment
like
a
wrappings
it
would
have
been
utterly
impossible
for
hen
smitz
to
have
sewed
himself
into
the
casing
not
only
because
it
bound
his
arms
tight
to
his
sides
but
because
the
burlap
was
lapped
over
and
sewed
from
the
outside
this
once
and
for
all
ended
the
suicide
theory
the
question
was
who
was
the
murderer
as
philo
gubb
turned
away
from
the
bier
undertaker
bartman
entered
the
morgue
the
crowd
outside
is
getting
impatient
gubb
he
said
in
his
soft
undertakery
voice
it
is
getting
on
toward
their
lunch
hour
and
they
want
to
crowd
into
my
front
office
to
find
out
what
learned
i
afraid
they
break
my
windows
pushing
so
hard
against
them
i
do
want
to
hurry
you
but
if
you
would
go
out
and
tell
them
wiggins
is
the
murderer
they
go
away
of
course
there
no
doubt
about
wiggins
being
the
murderer
since
he
has
admitted
he
asked
the
for
the
bulb
what
bulb
asked
philo
gubb
the
bulb
we
found
sewed
inside
this
burlap
when
we
sliced
it
open
said
bartman
matter
of
fact
we
found
it
in
hand
took
it
for
a
clue
and
i
guess
it
fixes
the
murder
on
wiggins
beyond
all
doubt
the
says
wiggins
got
it
from
him
and
what
does
wiggins
remark
on
that
subject
asked
gubb
not
a
word
said
bartman
his
lawyer
told
him
not
to
open
his
mouth
and
he
wo
listen
to
that
crowd
out
there
i
will
attend
to
that
crowd
right
presently
said
gubb
sternly
what
i
should
wish
to
know
now
is
why
mister
wiggins
went
and
sewed
an
bulb
in
with
the
corpse
for
in
the
first
place
said
bartman
he
did
sew
it
in
with
any
corpse
because
hen
smitz
was
a
corpse
when
he
was
sewed
in
that
burlap
unless
wiggins
drowned
him
first
for
mortimer
says
hen
smitz
died
of
drowning
and
in
the
second
place
if
you
had
a
live
man
to
sew
in
burlap
and
had
to
hold
him
while
you
sewed
him
you
be
liable
to
sew
anything
in
with
him
my
idea
is
that
wiggins
and
some
of
his
crew
jumped
on
hen
smitz
and
threw
him
down
and
some
of
them
held
him
while
the
others
sewed
him
in
my
idea
is
that
wiggins
got
that
bulb
to
replace
one
that
had
burned
out
and
that
he
met
hen
smitz
and
had
words
with
him
and
they
clinched
and
hen
smitz
grabbed
the
bulb
and
then
the
others
came
and
they
sewed
him
into
the
burlap
and
dumped
him
into
the
river
so
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
go
out
and
tell
that
crowd
that
wiggins
did
it
and
that
you
let
them
know
who
helped
him
as
soon
as
you
find
out
and
you
better
do
it
before
they
break
my
windows
detective
gubb
turned
and
went
out
of
the
morgue
as
he
left
the
undertaker
establishment
the
crowd
gave
a
slight
cheer
but
gubb
walked
hurriedly
toward
the
jail
he
found
policeman
there
and
questioned
him
about
the
bulb
and
proud
to
be
the
center
of
so
large
and
interested
a
gathering
of
his
fellow
citizens
pulled
the
bulb
from
his
pocket
and
handed
it
to
gubb
while
he
repeated
in
more
detail
the
facts
given
by
bartman
gubb
looked
at
the
bulb
i
presume
to
suppose
he
said
that
wiggins
asked
the
for
a
new
bulb
to
replace
one
that
was
burned
out
you
right
said
why
for
the
reason
that
this
bulb
is
a
bulb
said
gubb
and
so
it
was
the
inner
surface
of
the
bulb
was
darkened
slightly
and
the
filament
of
carbon
was
severed
took
the
bulb
and
examined
it
curiously
that
odd
ai
it
he
said
it
might
so
seem
to
the
mind
said
gubb
but
to
the
deteckative
mind
nothing
is
odd
no
no
this
ai
so
odd
either
said
for
whether
hen
smitz
grabbed
the
bulb
before
wiggins
changed
the
new
one
for
the
old
one
or
after
he
changed
it
do
make
so
much
difference
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
to
the
deteckative
mind
said
gubb
it
makes
the
difference
that
this
ai
the
bulb
you
thought
it
was
and
hence
consequently
it
ai
the
bulb
mister
wiggins
got
from
the
gubb
started
away
the
crowd
followed
him
he
did
not
go
in
search
of
the
original
bulb
at
once
he
returned
first
to
his
room
where
he
changed
his
undertaker
disguise
for
number
six
that
of
a
blue
with
a
long
brown
beard
then
he
led
the
way
back
to
the
packing
house
again
the
crowd
was
halted
at
the
gate
but
again
gubb
passed
inside
and
he
found
the
eating
his
luncheon
out
of
a
tin
pail
the
was
perfectly
willing
to
talk
it
was
like
this
said
the
we
been
working
overtime
in
some
departments
down
here
and
wiggins
and
his
crew
had
to
work
overtime
the
night
hen
smitz
was
murdered
hen
and
wiggins
was
at
outs
or
anyway
i
heard
hen
tell
wiggins
he
better
be
hunting
another
job
because
he
would
have
this
one
long
and
wiggins
told
hen
that
if
he
lost
his
job
he
murder
him
wiggins
would
murder
hen
that
is
i
did
think
it
was
much
of
anything
but
loose
talk
at
the
time
but
hen
was
working
overtime
too
he
been
working
nights
up
in
that
little
room
of
his
on
the
second
floor
for
quite
some
time
and
this
night
wiggins
come
to
me
and
he
says
hen
had
asked
him
for
a
fresh
bulb
so
i
give
it
to
wiggins
and
then
i
went
home
and
come
to
find
out
wiggins
sewed
that
bulb
up
with
hen
perhaps
maybe
you
have
like
this
into
your
said
gubb
producing
the
needle
long
sam
had
given
him
the
took
the
needle
and
examined
it
carefully
never
had
any
like
that
he
said
now
if
said
philo
gubb
if
the
bulb
that
was
sewed
up
into
the
burlap
with
henry
smitz
was
a
new
bulb
and
if
wiggins
had
given
the
new
bulb
to
henry
and
if
henry
had
changed
the
new
bulb
for
an
old
one
where
would
he
have
changed
it
at
up
in
his
room
where
he
was
always
tinkering
at
that
machine
of
his
said
the
could
i
have
the
pleasure
of
taking
a
look
into
that
there
room
for
a
moment
of
time
asked
gubb
the
arose
returned
the
remnants
of
his
luncheon
to
his
and
led
the
way
up
the
stairs
he
opened
the
door
of
the
room
henry
smitz
had
used
as
a
and
gubb
walked
in
the
room
was
in
some
confusion
but
except
in
one
or
two
particulars
no
more
than
a
is
apt
to
be
a
rather
cumbrous
machine
the
invention
on
which
henry
smitz
had
been
working
stood
as
the
murdered
man
had
left
it
all
its
levers
wheels
arms
and
cogs
intact
a
chair
tipped
over
lay
on
the
floor
a
roll
of
burlap
stood
on
a
roller
by
the
machine
looking
up
gubb
saw
on
the
ceiling
the
lighting
fixture
of
the
room
and
in
it
was
a
clean
shining
bulb
where
another
similar
bulb
might
have
been
in
the
other
socket
was
a
plug
from
which
an
insulated
wire
evidently
to
furnish
power
ran
to
the
small
motor
connected
with
the
machine
on
which
henry
smitz
had
been
working
the
was
the
first
to
speak
hello
he
said
somebody
broke
that
window
and
it
was
true
somebody
had
not
only
broken
the
window
but
had
broken
every
pane
and
the
sash
itself
but
gubb
was
not
interested
in
this
he
was
gazing
at
the
electric
bulb
and
thinking
of
part
two
lesson
six
of
the
course
of
twelve
lessons
how
to
identify
by
with
general
remarks
on
the
bertillon
system
he
looked
about
for
some
means
of
reaching
the
bulb
above
his
head
his
eye
lit
on
the
fallen
chair
by
placing
the
chair
upright
and
placing
one
foot
on
the
frame
of
henry
smitz
machine
and
the
other
on
the
he
could
reach
the
bulb
he
righted
the
chair
and
stepped
onto
its
seat
he
put
one
foot
on
the
frame
of
henry
smitz
machine
very
carefully
he
put
the
other
foot
on
the
top
of
the
he
reached
upward
and
unscrewed
the
bulb
the
saw
the
chair
totter
he
sprang
forward
to
steady
it
but
he
was
too
late
philo
gubb
grasping
the
air
fell
on
the
broad
level
board
that
formed
the
middle
part
of
henry
smitz
machine
the
effect
was
instantaneous
the
cogs
and
wheels
of
the
machine
began
to
revolve
rapidly
two
strong
steel
arms
flopped
down
and
held
detective
gubb
to
the
table
clamping
his
arms
to
his
side
the
roll
of
burlap
unrolled
and
as
it
unrolled
the
loose
end
was
seized
and
slipped
under
gubb
and
wrapped
around
him
and
drawn
taut
bundling
him
as
a
sheep
carcass
is
bundled
an
arm
reached
down
and
back
and
forth
with
a
sewing
motion
and
passed
from
gubb
head
to
his
feet
as
it
reached
his
feet
a
knife
sliced
the
burlap
in
which
he
was
wrapped
from
the
burlap
on
the
roll
and
then
a
most
surprising
thing
happened
as
if
the
board
on
which
he
lay
had
been
a
catapult
it
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
raised
philo
gubb
and
tossed
him
through
the
open
window
the
heard
a
muffled
scream
and
then
a
great
splash
but
when
he
ran
to
the
window
the
great
detective
had
disappeared
in
the
bosom
of
the
mississippi
like
henry
smitz
he
had
tried
to
reach
the
ceiling
by
standing
on
the
like
henry
smitz
he
had
fallen
upon
the
newly
invented
burlaping
and
loading
machine
like
henry
smitz
he
had
been
wrapped
and
thrown
through
the
window
into
the
river
but
unlike
henry
smitz
he
had
not
been
sewn
into
the
burlap
because
philo

had
the
needle
in
his

it

the

to

as
nearly
as
possible
the
probable
action
of
the

had

a
man
may
be
