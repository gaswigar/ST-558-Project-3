let
get
out
of
here
fast
i
said
we
probably
set
off
an
alarm
already
as
if
in
answer
a
low
chime
cut
across
our
talk
pearly
light
sprang
up
on
a
square
panel
foster
and
i
stared
at
it
what
do
you
make
of
it
he
said
i
no
expert
on
relics
i
said
but
if
that
not
a
radar
screen
i
eat
it
i
sat
down
in
the
single
chair
before
the
dusty
control
console
and
watched
a
red
blip
creep
across
the
screen
that
blip
is
either
a
mighty
slow
airplane
or
it
at
one
hell
of
an
altitude
i
sat
upright
eyes
on
the
screen
look
at
this
foster
i
snapped
a
pattern
of
dots
flashed
across
the
screen
faded
flashed
again
i
do
like
that
thing
blinking
at
us
i
said
it
makes
me
feel
conspicuous
i
looked
at
the
big
red
button
beside
the
screen
maybe
if
i
pushed
that
without
waiting
to
think
it
over
i
jabbed
at
it
i
not
sure
you
should
have
done
that
foster
said
there
room
for
doubt
i
said
in
a
strained
voice
it
looks
like
i
launched
a
bomb
from
the
ship
overhead

a

prologue
he
awoke
and
lay
for
a
moment
looking
up
at
a
low
ceiling
dimly
visible
in
a
faint
red
glow
feeling
the
hard
mat
under
his
back
he
turned
his
head
saw
a
wall
and
a
panel
on
which
a
red
indicator
light
glared
he
swung
his
legs
over
the
side
of
the
narrow
couch
and
sat
up
the
room
was
small
unadorned
pain
throbbed
in
his
forearm
he
shook
back
the
loose
sleeve
of
the
strange
purple
garment
saw
a
pattern
of
tiny
punctures
in
the
skin
he
recognized
the
mark
of
a
feeding
hunter
who
would
have
dared
a
dark
shape
on
the
floor
caught
his
eye
he
slid
from
the
couch
knelt
by
the
still
body
of
a
man
in
a
purple
tunic
stained
black
with
blood
gently
he
rolled
the
body
onto
its
back
ammaerln
he
seized
the
limp
wrist
there
was
a
faint
pulse
he
rose
and
saw
a
second
body
and
near
the
door
two
more
quickly
he
went
to
each
all
three
were
dead
hideously
slashed
only
ammaerln
still
breathed
faintly
he
went
to
the
door
shouted
into
the
darkness
the
ranged
shelves
of
a
library
gave
back
a
brief
echo
he
turned
back
to
the
room
noticed
a
recording
monitor
against
a
wall
he
fitted
the
neurodes
to
the
dying
man
temples
but
for
this
gesture
of
recording
ammaerln
life
memories
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
he
must
get
him
to
a
therapist
and
quickly
he
crossed
the
library
found
a
great
echoing
hall
beyond
this
was
not
the
sapphire
palace
beside
the
shallow
sea
the
lines
were
unmistakeable
he
was
aboard
a
ship
a
why
how
he
stood
uncertain
the
silence
was
absolute
he
crossed
the
great
hall
and
entered
the
observation
lounge
here
lay
another
dead
man
by
his
uniform
a
member
of
the
crew
he
touched
a
knob
and
the
great
screens
glowed
blue
a
giant
crescent
swam
into
focus
locked
soft
blue
against
the
black
of
space
beyond
it
a
smaller
companion
hung
airless
what
worlds
were
these
an
hour
later
he
had
ranged
the
vast
ship
from
end
to
end
in
all
seven
corpses
cruelly
slashed
peopled
the
silent
vessel
in
the
control
sector
the
communicator
lights
glowed
but
to
his
call
there
was
no
answer
from
the
strange
world
below
he
turned
to
the
recording
room
ammaerln
still
breathed
weakly
the
memory
recording
had
been
completed
all
that
the
dying
man
remembered
of
his
long
life
was
imprinted
now
in
the
silver
cylinder
it
remained
only
to
the
trace
his
eyes
was
caught
by
a
small
cylinder
projecting
from
the
aperture
at
the
side
of
the
high
couch
where
he
had
awakened
his
own
so
he
himself
had
undergone
the
change
he
took
the
cylinder
thrust
it
into
a
pocket
then
whirled
at
a
sound
a
nest
of
hunters
swarming
globes
of
pale
light
clustered
at
the
door
then
they
were
on
him
they
pressed
close
humming
in
their
eagerness
without
the
proper
weapon
he
was
helpless
he
caught
up
the
limp
body
of
ammaerln
with
the
hunters
trailing
in
a
luminous
stream
he
ran
with
his
burden
to
the
bay
three
shuttles
lay
in
their
cradles
he
groped
to
a
switch
his
head
swimming
with
the
sulphurous
reek
of
the
hunters
light
flooded
the
bay
driving
them
back
he
entered
the
lifeboat
placed
the
dying
man
on
a
cushioned
couch
it
had
been
long
since
he
had
manned
the
controls
of
a
ship
but
he
had
not
forgotten
ammaerln
was
dead
when
the
lifeboat
reached
the
planetary
surface
the
vessel
settled
gently
and
the
lock
cycled
he
looked
out
at
a
vista
of
ragged
forest
this
was
no
civilized
world
only
the
landing
ring
and
the
clearing
around
it
showed
the
presence
of
man
there
was
a
hollow
in
the
earth
by
a
square
marker
block
at
the
eastern
perimeter
of
the
clearing
he
hoisted
the
body
of
ammaerln
to
his
back
and
moved
heavily
down
the
access
ladder
working
he
deepened
the
hollow
placed
the
body
in
it
scraped
earth
over
it
then
he
rose
and
turned
back
toward
the
shuttle
boat
forty
feet
away
a
dozen
men
squat
bearded
wrapped
in
the
shaggy
hides
of
beasts
stood
between
him
and
the
access
ladder
the
tallest
among
them
shouted
raised
a
bronze
sword
threateningly
behind
these
others
clustered
at
the
ladder
motionless
he
watched
as
one
scrambled
up
reached
the
top
disappeared
into
the
boat
in
a
moment
the
savage
reappeared
at
the
opening
and
hurled
down
handfuls
of
small
bright
objects
shouting
others
clambered
up
to
share
the
loot
the
first
man
again
vanished
within
the
boat
before
the
foremost
of
the
others
had
gained
the
entry
the
port
closed
shutting
off
a
terrified
cry
from
within
men
dropped
from
the
ladder
as
it
swung
up
the
boat
rose
slowly
angling
toward
the
west
dwindling
the
savages
shrank
back
awed
the
man
watched
until
the
tiny
blue
light
was
lost
against
the
sky
chapter
i
the
ad
read
of
fortune
seeks
companion
in
arms
to
share
unusual
adventure
foster
box
i
crumpled
the
newspaper
and
tossed
it
in
the
general
direction
of
the
wire
basket
beside
the
park
bench
pushed
back
a
slightly
frayed
cuff
and
took
a
look
at
my
bare
wrist
it
was
just
habit
the
watch
was
in
a
hock
shop
in
tupelo
mississippi
it
did
matter
i
did
have
to
know
what
time
it
was
across
the
park
most
of
the
store
windows
were
dark
along
the
side
street
there
were
no
people
in
sight
they
were
all
home
now
having
dinner
as
i
watched
the
lights
blinked
off
in
the
drug
store
with
the
bottles
of
colored
water
in
the
window
the
left
the
candy
and
cigar
emporium
at
the
end
of
the
line
i
fidgeted
on
the
hard
bench
and
felt
for
a
cigarette
i
did
have
i
wished
the
old
boy
back
of
the
counter
would
call
it
a
day
and
go
home
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
enough
i
was
going
to
rob
his
store
i
was
a
artist
maybe
that
why
that
nervous
feeling
was
playing
around
under
my
rib
cage
there
was
really
nothing
to
it
the
wooden
door
with
the
hardware
counter
lock
that
would
open
almost
as
easily
without
a
key
as
with
one
the
metal
box
with
the
day
receipts
in
it
i
be
on
my
way
to
the
depot
with
fare
to
miami
in
my
pocket
ten
minutes
after
i
cracked
the
door
i
learned
a
lot
harder
tricks
than
petty
larceny
back
when
i
had
a
big
future
ahead
with
army
intelligence
that
was
a
long
time
ago
and
i
had
a
lot
of
breaks
since
then
none
good
i
got
up
and
took
another
turn
around
the
park
it
was
a
warm
evening
and
the
mosquitoes
were
out
i
caught
a
whiff
of
frying
hamburger
from
the
elite
cafe
down
the
street
it
reminded
me
that
i
had
eaten
lately
there
were
lights
on
at
the
commercial
hotel
and
one
in
the
ticket
office
at
the
station
the
local
police
force
was
still
sitting
on
a
stool
at
the
rexall
talking
to
the
counter
girl
i
could
see
the
revolver
hanging
down
in
a
worn
leather
holster
at
his
hip
all
of
a
sudden
i
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
it
over
with
i
took
another
look
at
the
lights
all
the
stores
were
dark
now
there
was
nothing
to
wait
for
i
crossed
the
street
sauntered
past
the
cigar
store
there
were
dusty
boxes
of
stogies
in
the
window
and
piles
of
homemade
fudge
stacked
on
plates
with
paper
doilies
under
them
behind
them
the
interior
of
the
store
looked
grim
and
dead
i
looked
around
then
turned
down
the
side
street
toward
the
back
door
a
black
sedan
eased
around
the
corner
and
pulled
in
to
the
curb
a
face
leaned
over
to
look
at
me
through
lenses
like
the
bottoms
of
tabasco
bottles
the
hot
evening
air
stirred
and
i
felt
my
damp
shirt
cold
against
my
back
looking
for
anything
in
particular
mister
the
cop
said
i
just
looked
at
him
passing
through
town
are
you
he
asked
for
some
reason
i
shook
my
head
i
got
a
job
here
i
said
i
going
to
work
for
mr
foster
what
mr
foster
the
cop
voice
was
wheezy
but
relentless
a
voice
used
to
asking
questions
i
remembered
the
ad
something
about
an
adventure
foster
box
the
cop
was
still
staring
at
me
box
nineteen
i
said
he
looked
me
over
some
more
then
reached
across
and
opened
the
door
better
come
on
down
to
the
station
house
with
me
mister
he
said
at
police
headquarters
the
cop
motioned
me
to
a
chair
sat
down
behind
a
desk
and
pulled
a
phone
to
him
he
dialed
slowly
then
swiveled
his
back
to
me
to
talk
insects
danced
around
the
bare
light
bulb
there
was
an
odor
of
leather
and
unwashed
bedding
i
sat
and
listened
to
a
radio
in
the
distance
wailing
a
sad
song
it
was
half
an
hour
before
i
heard
a
car
pull
up
outside
the
man
who
came
through
the
door
was
wearing
a
light
suit
that
was
neither
new
nor
freshly
pressed
but
had
that
look
of
perfect
fit
and
taste
that
only
the
most
expensive
tailoring
can
achieve
he
moved
in
a
relaxed
way
but
gave
an
impression
of
power
held
in
reserve
at
first
glance
i
thought
he
was
in
his
middle
thirties
but
when
he
looked
my
way
i
saw
the
fine
lines
around
the
blue
eyes
i
got
to
my
feet
he
came
over
to
me
i
foster
he
said
and
held
out
his
hand
i
shook
it
my
name
is
legion
i
said
the
desk
sergeant
spoke
up
this
fellow
says
he
come
here
to
mayport
to
see
you
mr
foster
foster
looked
at
me
steadily
that
right
sergeant
this
gentleman
is
considering
a
proposition
i
made
well
i
did
know
foster
the
cop
said
i
quite
understand
sergeant
foster
said
we
all
feel
better
knowing
you
on
the
job
well
you
know
the
cop
said
we
may
as
well
be
on
our
way
then
foster
said
if
you
ready
mr
legion
sure
i
ready
i
said
foster
said
goodnight
to
the
cop
and
we
went
out
on
the
pavement
in
front
of
the
building
i
stopped
thanks
foster
i
said
i
comb
myself
out
of
your
hair
now
foster
had
his
hand
on
the
door
of
a
deceptively
cabriolet
i
could
smell
the
solid
leather
upholstery
from
where
i
stood
why
not
come
along
to
my
place
legion
he
said
we
might
at
least
discuss
my
proposition
i
shook
my
head
i
not
the
man
for
the
job
foster
i
said
if
you
like
to
advance
me
a
couple
of
bucks
i
get
myself
a
bite
to
eat
and
fade
right
out
of
your
life
what
makes
you
so
sure
you
not
interested
your
ad
said
something
about
adventure
i
had
my
adventures
now
i
just
looking
for
a
hole
to
crawl
into
i
do
believe
you
legion
foster
smiled
at
me
a
slow
calm
smile
i
think
your
adventures
have
hardly
begun
i
thought
about
it
if
i
went
along
i
at
least
get
a
meal
and
maybe
even
a
bed
for
the
night
it
was
better
than
curling
up
under
a
tree
well
i
said
a
remark
like
that
demands
time
for
an
explanation
i
got
into
the
car
and
sank
back
in
a
seat
that
seemed
to
fit
me
the
way
foster
jacket
fit
him
i
hope
you
wo
mind
if
i
drive
fast
foster
said
i
want
to
be
home
before
dark
we
started
up
and
wheeled
away
from
the
curb
like
a
torpedo
sliding
out
of
the
launching
tube
i
got
out
of
the
car
in
the
drive
at
foster
house
and
looked
around
at
the
wide
clipped
lawn
the
flower
beds
that
were
vivid
even
by
moonlight
the
line
of
tall
poplars
and
the
big
white
house
i
wish
i
had
come
i
said
this
kind
of
place
reminds
me
of
all
the
things
i
have
gotten
out
of
life
your
life
still
ahead
of
you
foster
said
he
opened
the
slab
of
mahogany
that
was
the
front
door
and
i
followed
him
inside
at
the
end
of
a
short
hall
he
flipped
a
switch
that
flooded
the
room
before
us
with
soft
light
i
stared
at
an
expanse
of
pale
grey
carpet
about
the
size
of
a
tennis
court
on
which
rested
glowing
danish
teak
furniture
upholstered
in
rich
colors
the
walls
were
a
grey
here
and
there
were
expensively
framed
abstractions
the
air
was
cool
with
the
heavy
coolness
of
air
conditioning
foster
crossed
to
a
bar
that
looked
modest
in
the
setting
in
spite
of
being
bigger
than
those
in
most
of
the
places
i
seen
lately
would
you
care
for
a
drink
he
said
i
looked
down
at
my
limp
stained
suit
and
grimy
cuffs
look
foster
i
said
i
just
realized
something
if
you
got
a
stable
i
go
sleep
in
it
foster
laughed
come
on
i
show
you
the
bath
i
came
downstairs
clean
showered
and
wearing
a
set
of
clothes
i
found
him
sitting
sipping
a
drink
and
listening
to
music
the
i
said
a
little
gloomy
is
it
i
read
something
else
into
it
foster
said
sit
down
and
have
a
bite
to
eat
and
a
drink
i
sat
in
one
of
the
big
soft
chairs
and
tried
not
to
let
my
hand
shake
as
i
reached
for
one
of
the
sandwiches
piled
on
the
coffee
table
tell
me
something
legion
foster
said
why
did
you
come
here
mention
my
name
if
you
did
intend
to
see
me
i
shook
my
head
it
just
worked
out
that
way
tell
me
something
about
yourself
foster
said
it
not
much
of
a
story
still
i
like
to
hear
it
well
i
was
born
grew
up
went
to
school
what
school
university
of
illinois
what
was
your
major
music
foster
looked
at
me
frowning
slightly
it
the
truth
i
said
i
wanted
to
be
a
conductor
the
army
had
other
ideas
i
was
in
my
last
year
when
the
draft
got
me
they
discovered
i
had
what
they
considered
an
aptitude
for
intelligence
work
i
did
mind
it
i
had
a
pretty
good
time
for
a
couple
of
years
go
on
foster
said
well
i
had
a
bath
and
a
good
meal
i
owed
him
something
if
he
wanted
to
hear
my
troubles
why
not
tell
him
i
was
putting
on
a
demonstration
a
defective
timer
set
off
a
charge
of
fifty
seconds
early
on
a
setting
a
student
was
killed
i
got
off
easy
with
a
busted
eardrum
and
a
pound
or
two
of
gravel
imbedded
in
my
back
when
i
got
out
of
the
hospital
the
army
felt
real
bad
about
letting
me
go
but
they
did
my
terminal
leave
pay
gave
me
a
big
weekend
in
san
francisco
and
set
me
up
in
business
as
a
private
investigator
i
had
enough
left
over
after
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
a
few
months
later
to
get
me
to
las
vegas
i
lost
what
was
left
and
took
a
job
with
a
casino
operator
named
gonino
i
stayed
with
gonino
for
nearly
a
year
then
one
night
a
visiting
bank
clerk
lost
his
head
and
shot
him
eight
times
with
a
target
pistol
i
left
town
the
same
night
after
that
i
sold
used
cars
for
a
couple
of
months
in
memphis
then
i
made
like
a
life
guard
at
daytona
baited
hooks
on
a
tuna
boat
out
of
key
west
all
the
odd
jobs
with
low
pay
and
no
future
i
spent
a
couple
of
years
in
cuba
all
i
got
out
of
that
was
two
bullet
scars
on
the
left
leg
and
a
prominent
position
on
a
cia
blacklist
after
that
things
got
tough
a
man
in
my
trade
ca
really
hope
to
succeed
in
a
big
way
without
the
little
blue
card
in
the
plastic
cover
to
back
his
play
i
was
headed
south
for
the
winter
and
i
picked
mayport
to
run
out
of
money
i
stood
up
i
sure
enjoyed
the
bath
foster
and
the
meal
too
i
like
real
well
to
get
into
that
bed
upstairs
and
have
a
night
sleep
just
to
make
it
complete
but
i
not
interested
in
the
job
i
turned
away
and
started
across
the
room
legion
foster
said
i
turned
a
beer
bottle
was
hanging
in
the
air
in
front
of
my
face
i
put
a
hand
up
fast
and
the
bottle
slapped
my
palm
not
bad
set
of
reflexes
for
a
man
whose
adventures
are
all
behind
him
foster
said
i
tossed
the
bottle
aside
if
i
missed
that
would
have
knocked
my
teeth
out
i
said
angrily
you
did
miss
even
though
you
weaving
a
little
from
the
beer
and
a
man
who
can
feel
a
pint
or
so
of
beer
is
an
alcoholic
so
you
clean
on
that
score
i
did
say
i
was
ready
for
the
rummy
ward
i
said
i
just
not
interested
in
your
proposition
whatever
it
is
legion
foster
said
maybe
you
have
the
idea
i
put
that
ad
in
the
paper
last
week
on
a
whim
the
fact
is
i
been
running
it
in
one
form
or
another
for
over
eight
years
i
looked
at
him
and
waited
not
only
locally
i
run
it
in
the
papers
and
in
some
of
the
national
weekly
and
monthly
publications
all
together
i
had
perhaps
fifty
responses
foster
smiled
wryly
about
three
quarters
of
them
were
from
women
who
thought
i
wanted
a
playmate
several
more
were
from
men
with
the
same
idea
the
few
others
were
hopelessly
unsuitable
that
surprising
i
said
i
have
thought
you
have
brought
half
the
nuts
in
the
country
out
of
the
woodwork
by
now
foster
looked
at
me
not
smiling
i
realized
suddenly
that
behind
the
urbane
façade
there
was
a
hint
of
tension
a
trace
of
worry
in
the
level
blue
eyes
i
like
very
much
to
interest
you
in
what
i
have
to
say
legion
i
think
you
lack
only
one
thing
confidence
in
yourself
i
laughed
shortly
what
are
the
qualifications
you
think
i
have
i
a
jack
of
no
trades
legion
you
a
man
of
considerable
intelligence
and
more
than
a
little
culture
you
travelled
widely
and
know
how
to
handle
yourself
in
difficult
situations
or
you
would
have
survived
i
sure
your
training
includes
techniques
of
entry
and
not
known
to
the
average
man
and
perhaps
most
important
although
you
an
honest
man
you
capable
of
breaking
the
law
when
necessary
so
that
it
i
said
no
i
not
forming
a
mob
legion
as
i
said
in
the
ad
this
is
an
unusual
adventure
it
may
probably
will
involve
infringing
various
statutes
and
regulations
of
one
sort
or
another
after
you
know
the
full
story
i
leave
you
to
judge
whether
it
justifiable
if
foster
was
trying
to
arouse
my
curiosity
he
was
succeeding
he
was
dead
serious
about
whatever
it
was
he
was
planning
it
sounded
like
something
no
one
with
good
sense
would
want
to
get
involved
in
but
on
the
other
hand
foster
did
look
like
the
sort
of
man
to
do
anything
foolish
why
do
you
tell
me
what
this
is
all
about
i
said
why
would
a
man
with
all
this
i
waved
a
hand
at
the
luxurious
room
want
to
pick
a
hobo
like
me
out
of
the
gutter
and
talk
him
into
taking
a
job
your
ego
has
taken
a
severe
beating
legion
that
obvious
i
think
you
afraid
that
i
expect
too
much
of
you
or
that
i
be
shocked
by
some
disclosure
you
may
make
perhaps
if
you
forget
yourself
and
your
problems
for
the
moment
we
could
reach
an
understanding
yeah
i
said
just
forget
my
problems
chiefly
money
problems
of
course
most
of
the
problems
of
this
society
involve
the
abstraction
of
values
that
money
represents
okay
i
said
i
got
my
problems
you
got
yours
let
leave
it
at
that
you
feel
that
because
i
have
material
comfort
my
problems
must
of
necessity
be
trivial
ones
foster
said
tell
me
legion
have
you
ever
known
a
man
who
suffered
from
amnesia
foster
crossed
the
room
to
a
small
writing
desk
took
something
from
a
drawer
then
looked
at
me
i
like
you
to
examine
this
he
said
i
went
over
and
took
the
object
from
his
hand
it
was
a
small
book
with
a
cover
of
plastic
unornamented
except
for
an
embossed
design
of
two
concentric
rings
i
opened
the
cover
the
pages
were
as
thin
as
tissue
but
opaque
and
covered
with
extremely
fine
writing
in
strange
foreign
characters
the
last
dozen
pages
were
in
english
i
had
to
hold
the
book
close
to
my
eyes
to
read
the
minute
script
having
come
nigh
to
calamity
with
the
near
lofs
of
the
key
i
will
henceforth
keep
this
journal
in
the
english
tongue
footnote
transcriber
note
sections
of
this
text
used
long
s
typeface
text
left
as
printed
with
the
letter
f
substituted
for
the
long
s
if
this
is
an
explanation
of
something
it
too
subtle
for
me
i
said
legion
how
old
would
you
say
i
am
that
a
hard
one
i
said
when
i
first
saw
you
i
would
have
said
the
late
thirties
maybe
now
frankly
you
look
closer
to
fifty
i
can
show
you
proof
foster
said
that
i
spent
the
better
part
of
a
year
in
a
military
hospital
in
france
i
awakened
in
a
ward
bandaged
to
the
eyes
and
with
no
memories
whatever
of
my
life
before
that
day
according
to
the
records
made
at
the
time
i
appeared
to
be
about
thirty
years
of
age
well
i
said
amnesia
not
so
unusual
among
war
casualties
and
you
seem
to
have
done
pretty
well
since
foster
shook
his
head
impatiently
there
nothing
difficult
about
acquiring
material
wealth
in
this
society
though
the
effort
kept
me
well
occupied
for
a
number
of
years
and
diverted
my
thoughts
from
the
question
of
my
past
life
the
time
came
however
when
i
had
the
leisure
to
pursue
the
matter
the
clues
i
had
were
meagre
enough
the
notebook
i
shown
you
was
found
near
me
and
i
had
a
ring
on
my
finger
foster
held
out
his
hand
on
the
middle
finger
was
a
massive
signet
engraved
with
the
same
design
of
concentric
circles
i
had
seen
on
the
cover
of
the
notebook
i
was
badly
burned
my
clothing
was
charred
oddly
enough
the
notebook
was
quite
unharmed
though
it
was
found
among
burned
debris
it
made
of
very
tough
stuff
what
did
you
find
out
in
a
word
nothing
no
military
unit
claimed
me
i
spoke
english
from
which
it
was
deduced
that
i
was
english
or
american
they
could
tell
which
from
your
accent
apparently
not
it
appears
i
spoke
a
sort
of
hybrid
dialect
maybe
you
lucky
i
be
happy
to
forget
my
first
thirty
years
i
spent
a
considerable
sum
of
money
in
my
attempts
to
discover
my
past
foster
went
on
and
several
years
of
time
in
the
end
i
gave
it
up
and
it
was
until
then
that
i
found
the
first
faint
inkling
so
you
did
find
something
i
said
nothing
i
had
had
all
along
the
notebook
i
have
thought
you
would
have
read
that
before
you
did
anything
else
i
said
do
tell
me
you
put
it
in
the
bureau
drawer
and
forgot
it
i
read
it
of
course
what
i
could
read
of
it
only
a
relatively
small
section
is
in
english
the
rest
is
a
cipher
and
what
i
read
seemed
meaningless
quite
unrelated
to
me
you
glanced
through
it
it
no
more
than
a
journal
irregularly
kept
and
so
cryptic
as
to
be
little
better
than
a
code
itself
and
of
course
the
dates
they
range
from
the
early
eighteenth
century
through
the
early
twentieth
a
sort
of
family
record
maybe
i
said
carried
on
generation
after
generation
did
it
mention
any
names
or
places
look
at
it
again
legion
foster
said
see
if
you
notice
anything
odd
other
than
what
we
already
discussed
i
thumbed
through
the
book
again
it
was
no
more
than
an
inch
thick
but
it
was
heavy
surprisingly
heavy
there
were
a
lot
of
pages
i
shuffled
through
hundreds
of
closely
written
sheets
and
yet
the
book
was
less
than
half
used
i
read
bits
here
and
there
may
the
voyage
was
not
a
succefs
i
must
forsake
this
avenue
of
enquiry
builded
the
weft
barrier
a
cubit
higher
now
the
fires
burn
every
night
is
there
no
limit
to
their
infernal
perfiftence
i
have
great
hopes
for
the
philadelphia
enterprise
my
greatest
foe
is
impatience
all
preparations
for
the
change
are
made
yet
i
confefs
i
am
uneasy
there
are
plenty
of
oddities
i
said
aside
from
the
entries
themselves
this
is
supposed
to
be
old
but
the
quality
of
the
paper
and
binding
beats
anything
i
seen
and
that
handwriting
is
pretty
fancy
for
a
quill
pen
there
a
stylus
clipped
to
the
spine
of
the
book
foster
said
it
was
written
with
that
i
looked
pulled
out
a
slim
pen
then
looked
at
foster
speaking
of
odd
i
said
a
genuine
antique
early
colonial
pen
turn
up
every
day
suspend
your
judgement
until
you
seen
it
all
foster
said
and
two
hundred
years
on
one
refill
that
not
bad
i
riffled
through
the
pages
then
i
tossed
the
book
onto
the
table
kidding
who
foster
i
said
the
book
was
described
in
detail
in
the
official
record
of
which
i
have
copies
they
mention
the
paper
and
binding
the
stylus
even
quote
some
of
the
entries
the
authorities
worked
over
it
pretty
closely
trying
to
identify
me
they
reached
the
same
conclusion
as
you
that
it
was
the
work
of
a
crackpot
but
they
saw
the
same
book
you
looking
at
now
so
what
so
it
was
faked
up
some
time
during
the
war
what
does
that
prove
i
ready
to
concede
it
forty
years
old
you
do
understand
legion
foster
said
i
told
you
i
woke
up
in
a
military
hospital
in
france
but
it
was
an
aef
hospital
and
the
year
was
chapter
ii
i
glanced
sideways
at
foster
he
did
look
like
a
nut
all
i
got
to
say
is
i
said
you
a
hell
of
a
ninety
you
find
my
appearance
strangely
youthful
what
would
be
your
reaction
if
i
told
you
that
i
aged
greatly
in
the
past
few
months
that
a
year
ago
i
could
have
passed
as
no
older
than
thirty
without
the
slightest
difficulty
i
do
think
i
believe
you
i
said
and
i
sorry
foster
but
i
do
believe
the
bit
about
the
hospital
either
how
can
i
it
i
know
fantastic
but
let
go
back
a
moment
to
the
book
itself
look
closely
at
the
paper
it
been
examined
by
experts
they
baffled
by
it
attempts
to
analyze
it
chemically
failed
they
were
unable
to
take
a
sample
it
impervious
to
solvents
they
could
get
a
sample
i
said
why
not
just
tear
off
the
corner
of
one
of
the
sheets
try
it
foster
said
i
picked
up
the
book
and
plucked
at
the
edge
of
one
of
the
blank
sheets
then
pinched
harder
and
pulled
the
paper
held
i
got
a
better
grip
and
pulled
again
it
was
like
fine
tough
leather
except
that
it
did
even
stretch
it
tough
all
right
i
said
i
took
out
my
pocket
knife
and
opened
it
and
worked
on
the
edge
of
the
paper
nothing
i
went
over
to
the
bureau
and
put
the
paper
flat
against
the
top
and
sawed
at
it
putting
my
weight
on
the
knife
i
raised
the
knife
and
brought
it
down
hard
i
did
so
much
as
mark
the
sheet
i
put
the
knife
away
that
some
paper
foster
i
said
try
to
tear
the
binding
foster
said
put
a
match
to
it
shoot
at
it
if
you
like
nothing
will
make
an
impression
on
that
material
now
you
a
logical
man
legion
is
there
something
here
outside
ordinary
experience
or
is
there
not
i
sat
down
feeling
for
a
cigarette
i
still
did
have
what
does
it
prove
i
said
only
that
the
book
is
not
a
simple
fraud
you
facing
something
which
ca
be
dismissed
as
fancy
the
book
exists
that
is
our
basic
point
of
departure
where
do
we
go
from
there
there
is
a
second
factor
to
be
considered
foster
went
on
at
some
time
in
the
past
i
seem
to
have
made
an
enemy
someone
or
something
is
systematically
hunting
me
i
tried
a
laugh
but
it
felt
out
of
place
why
not
sit
still
and
let
it
catch
up
with
you
maybe
it
could
tell
you
what
the
whole
thing
is
about
foster
shook
his
head
it
started
almost
thirty
years
ago
he
said
i
was
driving
south
from
albany
new
york
at
night
it
was
a
long
straight
stretch
of
road
no
houses
i
noticed
lights
following
me
not
headlights
something
that
bobbed
along
off
in
the
fields
along
the
road
but
they
kept
pace
gradually
moving
alongside
then
they
closed
in
ahead
keeping
out
of
range
of
my
headlights
i
stopped
the
car
i
was
seriously
alarmed
just
curious
i
wanted
a
better
look
so
i
switched
on
my
spotlight
and
played
it
on
the
lights
they
disappeared
as
the
light
touched
them
after
half
a
dozen
were
gone
the
rest
began
closing
in
i
kept
picking
them
off
there
was
a
sound
too
a
sort
of
humming
i
caught
a
whiff
of
sulphur
then
and
suddenly
i
was
afraid
deathly
afraid
i
caught
the
last
one
in
the
beam
no
more
than
ten
feet
from
the
car
i
ca
describe
the
horror
of
the
moment
it
sounds
pretty
weird
i
said
but
what
was
there
to
be
afraid
of
it
must
have
been
some
kind
of
heat
lightning
there
is
always
the
pat
explanation
foster
said
but
no
explanation
can
rationalize
the
instinctive
dread
i
felt
i
started
up
the
car
and
drove
on
right
through
the
night
and
the
next
day
i
sensed
that
i
must
put
distance
between
myself
and
whatever
it
was
i
had
met
i
bought
a
home
in
california
and
tried
to
put
the
incident
out
of
my
mind
with
limited
success
then
it
happened
again
the
same
thing
lights
it
was
more
sophisticated
the
next
time
it
started
with
interference
static
on
my
radio
then
it
affected
the
wiring
in
the
house
all
the
lights
began
to
glow
weakly
even
though
they
were
switched
off
i
could
feel
it
feel
it
in
my
bones
moving
closer
hemming
me
in
i
tried
the
car
it
would
start
fortunately
i
kept
a
few
horses
at
that
time
i
mounted
and
rode
into
town
and
at
a
fair
gallop
you
may
be
sure
i
saw
the
lights
but
outdistanced
them
i
caught
a
train
and
kept
going
i
do
see
it
happened
again
four
times
in
all
i
thought
perhaps
i
had
succeeded
in
eluding
it
at
last
i
was
mistaken
i
have
had
definite
indications
that
my
time
here
is
drawing
to
a
close
i
would
have
been
gone
before
now
but
there
were
certain
arrangements
to
be
made
look
i
said
this
is
all
wrong
you
need
a
psychiatrist
not
an
guy
delusions
of
persecution
it
seemed
obvious
that
the
explanation
was
to
be
found
somewhere
in
my
past
life
foster
went
on
i
turned
to
the
notebook
my
only
link
i
copied
it
out
including
the
encrypted
portion
i
had
photostatic
enlargements
made
of
the
initial
section
the
part
written
in
unfamiliar
characters
none
of
the
experts
who
have
examined
the
script
have
been
able
to
identify
it
i
necessarily
therefore
concentrated
my
attention
on
the
last
section
the
only
part
written
in
english
i
was
immediately
struck
by
a
curious
fact
i
had
ignored
before
the
writer
made
references
to
an
enemy
a
mysterious
against
which
defensive
measures
had
to
be
taken
maybe
that
where
you
got
the
idea
i
said
when
you
first
read
the
book
the
writer
of
the
log
foster
said
was
dogged
by
the
same
nemesis
that
now
follows
me
it
does
make
any
sense
i
said
for
the
moment
foster
said
stop
looking
for
logic
in
the
situation
look
for
a
pattern
instead
there
a
pattern
all
right
i
said
the
next
thing
that
struck
me
foster
went
on
was
a
reference
to
a
loss
of
memory
a
second
point
of
some
familiarity
to
me
the
writer
expresses
frustration
at
the
inability
to
remember
certain
facts
which
would
have
been
useful
to
him
in
his
pursuit
what
kind
of
pursuit
some
sort
of
scientific
project
as
nearly
as
i
can
gather
the
journal
bristles
with
tantalizing
references
to
matters
that
are
never
explained
and
you
think
the
man
that
wrote
it
had
amnesia
not
exactly
amnesia
perhaps
foster
said
but
there
were
things
he
was
unable
to
remember
if
that
amnesia
we
all
got
it
i
said
nobody
got
a
perfect
memory
but
these
were
matters
of
importance
not
the
kinds
of
thing
that
simply
slip
one
mind
i
can
see
how
you
want
to
believe
the
book
had
something
to
do
with
your
past
foster
i
said
it
must
be
a
hard
thing
not
knowing
your
own
life
story
but
you
on
the
wrong
track
maybe
the
book
is
a
story
you
started
to
write
in
code
so
nobody
would
accidentally
read
the
stuff
and
kid
you
about
it
legion
what
was
it
you
planned
to
do
when
you
got
to
miami
the
question
caught
me
a
little
well
i
do
know
i
hedged
i
wanted
to
get
south
where
it
warm
i
used
to
know
a
few
people
in
other
words
nothing
foster
said
legion
i
pay
you
well
to
stay
with
me
and
see
this
thing
through
i
shook
my
head
not
me
foster
the
whole
thing
sounds
well
the
kindest
word
i
can
think
of
is
legion
foster
said
do
you
really
believe
i
insane
let
just
say
this
all
seems
a
little
screwy
to
me
mr
foster
i
not
asking
you
just
to
work
for
me
foster
said
i
asking
for
your
help
you
might
as
well
look
for
your
fortune
in
tea
leaves
i
said
irritated
there
nothing
in
what
you
told
me
there
more
legion
much
more
i
recently
made
an
important
discovery
when
i
know
you
with
me
i
tell
you
you
know
enough
now
to
accept
the
fact
that
this
is
entirely
a
figment
of
my
imagination
i
do
know
anything
i
said
so
far
it
all
talk
if
you
concerned
about
payment
no
damn
it
i
barked
where
are
the
papers
you
keep
talking
about
i
ought
to
have
my
head
examined
for
sitting
here
humoring
you
got
troubles
enough
i
stopped
talking
and
rubbed
my
hands
over
my
scalp
i
sorry
foster
i
said
i
guess
what
really
griping
me
is
that
you
got
everything
i
think
i
want
and
you
not
content
with
it
it
bothers
me
to
see
you
off
chasing
fairies
if
a
man
with
his
health
and
plenty
of
money
ca
enjoy
life
what
the
hell
is
there
for
anybody
foster
looked
at
me
thoughtfully
legion
if
you
could
have
anything
in
life
you
wanted
what
would
you
ask
for
anything
i
wanted
a
lot
of
different
things
once
i
wanted
to
be
a
hero
later
i
wanted
to
be
smart
know
all
the
answers
then
i
had
the
idea
that
a
chance
to
do
an
honest
job
one
that
needed
doing
was
the
big
thing
i
never
found
that
job
i
never
got
smart
either
or
figured
out
how
to
tell
a
hero
from
a
coward
without
a
program
in
other
words
foster
said
you
were
looking
for
an
abstraction
to
believe
in
in
this
case
justice
but
you
wo
find
justice
in
nature
it
a
thing
that
only
man
expects
or
acknowledges
there
are
some
good
things
in
life
i
like
to
get
a
piece
of
them
do
lose
your
capacity
for
dreaming
in
the
process
dreams
i
said
oh
i
got
those
i
want
an
island
somewhere
in
the
sun
where
i
can
spend
my
time
fishing
and
watching
the
sea
you
speaking
cynically
but
you
still
attempting
to
concretize
an
abstraction
foster
said
but
no
matter
materialism
is
simply
another
form
of
idealism
i
looked
at
foster
but
i
know
i
never
have
those
things
or
that
justice
you
were
talking
about
either
once
you
really
know
never
make
it
perhaps
unattainability
is
an
essential
element
of
any
dream
foster
said
but
hold
onto
your
dream
whatever
it
is
do
ever
give
it
up
so
much
for
philosophy
i
said
where
is
it
getting
us
you
like
to
see
the
papers
foster
said
he
fished
a
key
ring
from
an
inner
pocket
if
you
do
mind
going
out
to
the
car
he
said
and
perhaps
getting
your
hands
dirty
there
a
welded
to
the
frame
i
keep
photostats
of
everything
there
along
with
my
passport
emergency
funds
and
so
on
i
learned
to
be
ready
to
travel
on
very
short
notice
lift
the
floorboards
you
see
the
box
it
not
all
that
urgent
i
said
i
take
a
look
in
the
morning
after
i
caught
up
on
some
sleep
but
do
get
the
wrong
idea
it
just
my
curiosity
very
well
foster
said
he
lay
back
sighed
i
tired
legion
he
said
my
mind
is
tired
yeah
i
said
so
is
mine
not
to
mention
other
portions
of
my
anatomy
get
some
sleep
foster
said
we
talk
again
in
the
morning
i
pushed
back
the
light
blanket
and
slid
out
of
bed
underfoot
the
rug
was
as
thick
and
soft
as
a
working
girl
mink
i
went
across
to
the
closet
and
pushed
the
button
that
made
the
door
slide
aside
my
old
clothes
were
still
lying
on
the
floor
where
i
had
left
them
but
i
had
the
clean
ones
foster
had
lent
me
he
would
mind
if
i
borrowed
them
for
a
while
longer
it
would
be
cheaper
for
him
in
the
long
run
foster
was
as
looney
as
a
bike
racer
but
there
was
no
point
in
my
waiting
around
to
tell
him
so
the
borrowed
outfit
did
include
a
coat
i
thought
of
putting
my
old
jacket
on
but
it
was
warm
outside
and
a
grey
with
grease
spots
would
help
the
picture
any
i
transferred
my
personal
belongings
from
the
grimy
clothes
on
the
floor
and
eased
the
door
open
downstairs
the
curtains
were
drawn
in
the
living
room
i
could
vaguely
make
out
the
outline
of
the
bar
it
would
hurt
to
take
along
a
bite
to
eat
i
groped
my
way
behind
the
bar
felt
along
the
shelves
found
a
stack
of
small
cans
that
rattled
softly
nuts
probably
i
reached
to
put
a
can
on
the
bar
and
it
clattered
against
something
i
could
see
i
swore
silently
felt
over
the
obstruction
it
was
bulky
with
the
cold
smoothness
of
metal
and
there
were
small
projections
with
sharp
corners
it
felt
for
all
the
world
like
i
leaned
over
it
and
squinted
with
the
faint
gleam
of
moonlight
from
a
chink
in
the
heavy
curtains
falling
just
so
i
could
almost
make
out
the
shape
i
crouched
a
little
lower
and
caught
the
glint
of
light
along
the
perforated
jacket
of
a
calibre
machine
gun
my
eye
followed
the
barrel
made
out
the
darker
square
of
the
entrance
hall
and
the
tiny
reflection
of
light
off
the
polished
brass
doorknob
at
the
far
end
i
stepped
back
flattened
against
the
wall
with
a
hollow
feeling
inside
if
i
had
tried
to
walk
through
that
door
foster
was
crazy
enough
for
two
ordinary
nuts
my
eyes
flicked
around
the
room
i
had
to
get
out
quickly
before
he
jumped
out
and
said
and
i
died
of
heart
failure
the
windows
maybe
i
came
around
the
end
of
the
bar
got
down
and
crawled
under
the
barrel
of
the
gun
and
over
to
the
heavy
drapes
pushing
them
aside
pale
light
glowed
beyond
the
glass
not
the
soft
light
of
the
moon
but
a
milky
churning
glow
that
reminded
me
of
the
phosphorescence
of
sea
water
i
dropped
the
curtain
ducked
back
under
the
gun
into
the
hall
and
pushed
through
a
swinging
door
into
the
kitchen
there
was
a
faint
glow
from
the
luminous
handle
of
the
refrigerator
i
yanked
it
open
spilling
light
on
the
floor
and
looked
around
plenty
of
gleaming
white
fixtures
but
no
door
out
there
was
a
window
almost
obscured
by
leaves
i
eased
it
open
and
almost
broke
my
fist
on
a
trellis
back
in
the
hall
i
tried
two
more
doors
both
locked
a
third
opened
and
i
found
myself
looking
down
the
cellar
stairs
they
were
steep
and
dark
as
cellar
stairs
always
seem
to
be
but
they
might
be
the
way
out
i
felt
for
a
light
switch
flipped
it
on
a
weak
illumination
showed
me
a
patch
of
floor
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
it
still
inviting
but
i
went
down
there
was
an
oil
furnace
in
the
center
of
the
room
with
dusty
spidering
out
across
the
ceiling
some
heavy
packing
cases
of
rough
wood
were
stacked
along
one
wall
and
at
the
far
side
of
the
room
there
was
a
coal
bin
but
no
cellar
door
i
turned
to
go
back
up
then
i
heard
a
sound
and
froze
somewhere
a
cockroach
scuttled
briefly
then
i
heard
the
sound
again
a
faint
grinding
of
stone
against
stone
i
peered
through
the
shadows
my
mouth
suddenly
dry
there
was
nothing
the
thing
for
me
to
do
was
to
get
up
the
stairs
fast
batter
the
iron
trellis
out
of
the
kitchen
window
and
run
like
hell
the
trouble
was
i
had
to
move
to
do
it
and
the
sound
of
my
own
steps
was
so
loud
it
was
paralyzing
compared
to
this
the
shock
of
stumbling
over
the
gun
was
just
a
mild
kick
like
finding
a
whistle
in
your
ordinarily
i
did
believe
in
things
that
went
bump
in
the
night
but
this
time
i
was
hearing
the
bumps
myself
and
all
i
could
think
about
was
edgar
allen
poe
and
his
cheery
tales
about
people
who
got
themselves
buried
before
they
were
thoroughly
dead
there
was
another
sound
then
a
sharp
snap
and
i
saw
light
spring
up
from
a
crack
that
opened
across
the
floor
in
the
shadowy
corner
that
was
enough
for
me
i
jumped
for
the
stairs
took
them
three
at
a
time
and
banged
through
the
kitchen
door
i
grabbed
up
a
chair
swung
it
around
and
slammed
it
against
the
trellis
it
bounced
back
and
cracked
me
across
the
mouth
i
dropped
it
tasting
blood
maybe
that
was
what
i
needed
the
panic
faded
before
a
stronger
emotion
anger
i
turned
and
barged
along
the
dark
hall
to
the
living
room
and
lights
suddenly
went
on
i
whirled
and
saw
foster
standing
in
the
hall
doorway
fully
dressed
ok
foster
i
yelled
just
show
me
the
way
out
of
here
foster
held
my
eyes
his
face
tense
calm
yourself
legion
he
said
softly
what
happened
here
get
over
there
to
that
gun
i
snapped
nodding
toward
the
calibre
on
the
bar
disarm
it
and
then
get
the
front
door
open
i
leaving
foster
eyes
flicked
over
the
clothes
i
was
wearing
so
i
see
he
said
he
looked
me
in
the
face
again
what
is
it
frightened
you
legion
do
act
so
innocent
i
said
or
am
i
supposed
to
get
the
idea
the
brownies
set
up
that
booby
trap
while
you
were
asleep
his
eyes
went
to
the
gun
and
his
expression
tightened
it
mine
he
said
it
an
automatic
arrangement
something
activated
it
and
without
sounding
my
alarm
you
have
been
outside
have
you
how
could
i
this
is
important
legion
foster
rapped
it
would
take
more
than
the
sight
of
a
machine
gun
to
panic
you
what
have
you
seen
i
was
looking
for
a
back
door
i
said
i
went
down
to
the
cellar
i
did
like
it
down
there
so
i
came
back
up
what
did
you
see
in
the
cellar
foster
face
looked
strained
colorless
it
looked
like
i
hesitated
there
was
a
crack
in
the
floor
noises
lights
the
floor
foster
said
certainly
that
the
weak
point
he
seemed
to
be
talking
to
himself
i
jerked
a
thumb
over
my
shoulder
something
funny
going
on
outside
your
windows
too
foster
looked
toward
the
heavy
hangings
listen
carefully
legion
he
said
we
are
in
grave
danger
both
of
us
it
fortunate
you
arose
when
you
did
this
house
as
you
must
have
guessed
by
now
is
something
of
a
fortress
at
this
moment
it
is
under
attack
the
walls
are
protected
by
some
rather
formidable
defenses
i
ca
say
as
much
for
the
cellar
floor
it
merely
three
feet
of
we
have
to
go
now
very
swiftly
and
very
quietly
ok
show
me
i
said
foster
turned
and
went
back
along
the
hall
to
one
of
the
locked
doors
where
he
pressed
something
the
door
opened
and
i
followed
him
inside
a
small
room
he
crossed
to
a
blank
wall
pressed
against
it
a
panel
slid
aside
and
foster
jumped
back
god
wounds
he
gasped
he
threw
himself
at
the
wall
and
the
panel
closed
i
stood
stock
still
from
somewhere
there
was
a
smell
like
sulphur
what
the
hell
goes
on
i
said
my
voice
cracked
as
it
always
does
when
i
scared
that
odor
foster
said
quickly
the
other
way
i
stepped
back
and
foster
pushed
past
me
and
ran
along
the
hall
with
me
at
his
heels
i
did
look
back
to
see
what
was
at
my
own
heels
foster
took
the
stairs
three
at
a
time
pulled
up
short
on
the
landing
he
went
to
his
knees
shoved
back
an
isfahan
rug
as
supple
as
sable
and
gripped
a
steel
ring
set
in
the
floor
he
looked
at
me
his
face
white
invoke
thy
gods
he
said
hoarsely
and
heaved
at
the
ring
a
section
of
floor
swung
up
showing
the
first
step
of
a
flight
leading
down
into
a
black
hole
foster
did
hesitate
he
dropped
his
feet
in
scrambled
down
i
followed
the
stairs
went
down
about
ten
feet
ending
on
a
stone
floor
there
was
the
sound
of
a
latch
turning
and
we
stepped
out
into
a
larger
room
i
saw
moonlight
through
a
row
of
high
windows
and
smelled
the
fragrance
of
fresh
night
air
we
in
the
garage
foster
whispered
go
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
car
and
get
in
quietly
i
touched
the
smooth
flank
of
the
rakish
cabriolet
felt
my
way
around
it
and
eased
the
door
open
i
slipped
into
the
seat
and
closed
the
door
gently
beside
me
foster
touched
a
button
and
a
green
light
glowed
on
the
dash
ready
he
said
sure
the
starter
whined
half
a
turn
and
the
engine
caught
without
waiting
foster
gunned
it
let
in
the
clutch
the
car
leaped
for
the
closed
doors
and
i
ducked
and
then
saw
the
doors
snap
aside
as
the
car
roared
out
into
the
night
we
took
the
first
turn
in
the
drive
at
forty
and
rounded
onto
the
highway
at
sixty
tires
screaming
i
took
a
look
back
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
house
its
stately
façade
white
in
the
moonlight
and
then
we
were
out
of
sight
over
a
rise
what
it
all
about
i
called
over
the
rush
of
air
the
needle
touched
ninety
kept
going
later
foster
barked
i
did
feel
like
arguing
i
watched
in
the
mirror
for
a
few
minutes
wondering
where
all
the
cops
were
tonight
then
i
settled
down
in
the
padded
seat
and
watched
the
speedometer
eat
up
the
miles
chapter
iii
it
was
nearly
and
a
tentative
grey
streak
showed
through
the
palm
fronds
to
the
east
before
i
broke
the
silence
by
the
way
i
said
what
was
the
routine
with
the
steel
shutters
and
the
glass
in
the
kitchen
and
the
handy
machine
gun
covering
the
front
door
mice
bad
around
the
place
are
they
those
things
were
necessary
and
more
now
that
the
short
hairs
along
my
spine
have
relaxed
i
said
the
whole
thing
looks
pretty
silly
we
run
far
enough
now
to
be
able
to
stop
and
turn
around
and
stick
our
tongues
out
not
yet
not
for
a
long
while
yet
why
do
we
just
go
back
home
i
went
on
and
no
foster
said
sharply
i
want
your
word
on
that
legion
no
matter
what
do
ever
go
near
that
house
again
it
be
daylight
soon
i
said
we
feel
pretty
asinine
about
this
little
trip
after
the
sun
comes
up
but
do
worry
i
wo
tell
anybody
we
got
to
keep
moving
foster
said
at
the
next
town
telephone
for
seats
on
a
flight
out
of
miami
hold
on
i
said
you
raving
what
about
your
house
we
even
stick
around
long
enough
to
make
sure
the
tv
was
turned
off
and
what
about
passports
and
money
and
luggage
and
what
makes
you
think
i
going
with
you
i
kept
myself
in
readiness
for
this
emergency
foster
said
there
are
disposition
instructions
for
the
house
on
file
with
a
legal
firm
in
jacksonville
there
is
nothing
to
connect
me
with
my
former
life
once
i
changed
my
name
and
disappeared
as
for
the
rest
we
can
buy
luggage
in
the
morning
my
passport
is
in
the
car
perhaps
we
better
go
first
to
puerto
rico
until
we
can
arrange
for
one
for
you
look
i
said
i
got
spooked
in
the
dark
that
all
why
not
just
admit
we
made
fools
of
ourselves
foster
shook
his
head
the
inherent
inertia
of
the
human
mind
he
said
how
it
fights
to
resist
new
ideas
the
kind
of
new
ideas
you
talking
about
could
get
both
of
us
locked
up
in
the
chuckle
ward
i
said
legion
foster
said
i
think
you
better
write
down
what
i
going
to
tell
you
it
important
vitally
important
i
wo
waste
time
with
preliminaries
the
notebook
i
showed
you
it
in
my
jacket
you
must
read
the
english
portion
of
it
afterwards
what
i
about
to
say
may
make
more
sense
i
hope
you
do
feel
your
last
will
and
testament
coming
on
foster
i
said
not
before
you
tell
me
what
that
was
we
were
both
so
eager
to
get
away
from
i
be
frank
with
you
foster
said
flatly
i
do
know
foster
wheeled
into
the
dark
drive
of
a
silent
service
station
eased
to
a
stop
set
the
brake
and
slumped
back
in
the
seat
do
you
mind
driving
for
a
while
legion
he
said
i
not
feeling
very
well
sure
i
drive
i
said
i
opened
the
door
and
got
out
and
went
around
to
his
side
foster
sat
limply
eyes
closed
his
face
drawn
and
strained
he
looked
older
than
he
had
last
night
years
older
the
night
experiences
had
taken
anything
off
my
age
either
foster
opened
his
eyes
looked
at
me
blankly
he
seemed
to
gather
himself
with
an
effort
i
sorry
he
said
i
not
myself
he
moved
over
and
i
got
in
the
driver
seat
if
you
sick
i
said
we
better
find
a
doctor
no
it
all
right
he
said
blurrily
just
keep
going
we
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
mayport
now
i
said
foster
turned
to
me
started
to
say
something
and
slumped
in
a
dead
faint
i
grabbed
for
his
pulse
it
was
strong
and
steady
i
rolled
up
an
eyelid
and
a
dilated
pupil
stared
sightlessly
he
was
all
right
i
hoped
but
the
thing
to
do
was
get
him
in
bed
and
call
a
doctor
we
were
at
the
edge
of
a
small
town
i
let
the
brake
off
and
drove
slowly
into
town
swung
around
a
corner
and
pulled
up
in
front
of
the
sagging
marquee
of
a
hotel
foster
stirred
as
i
cut
the
engine
foster
i
said
i
going
to
get
you
into
a
bed
can
you
walk
he
groaned
softly
and
opened
his
eyes
they
were
glassy
i
got
out
and
got
him
to
the
sidewalk
he
was
still
half
out
i
walked
him
into
the
dingy
lobby
and
over
to
a
reception
counter
where
a
dim
bulb
burned
i
dinged
the
bell
it
was
a
minute
before
an
old
man
shuffled
out
from
where
he
been
sleeping
he
yawned
eyed
me
suspiciously
looked
at
foster
we
do
want
no
drunks
here
he
said
respectable
house
my
friend
is
sick
i
said
give
me
a
double
with
bath
and
call
a
doctor
what
he
got
the
old
man
said
ai
contagious
is
it
that
what
i
want
a
doctor
to
tell
me
i
ca
get
the
doc
in
the
morning
and
we
got
no
private
bathrooms
i
signed
the
register
we
rode
the
elevator
to
the
fourth
floor
went
along
a
gloomy
hall
to
a
door
painted
a
peeling
brown
it
did
look
inviting
the
room
inside
was
much
better
there
was
a
lot
of
flowered
wallpaper
and
an
and
two
wide
beds
i
stretched
foster
out
on
one
he
lay
relaxed
a
serene
expression
on
his
face
the
kind
undertakers
try
for
but
never
quite
seem
to
manage
i
sat
down
on
the
other
bed
and
pulled
off
my
shoes
it
was
my
turn
to
have
a
tired
mind
i
lay
on
the
bed
and
let
it
sink
down
like
a
grey
stone
into
still
water
i
awoke
from
a
dream
in
which
i
had
just
discovered
the
answer
to
the
riddle
of
life
i
tried
to
hold
onto
it
but
it
slipped
away
it
always
does
grey
daylight
was
filtering
through
the
dusty
windows
foster
lay
slackly
on
the
broad
sagging
bed
a
ceiling
lamp
with
a
faded
fringed
shade
casting
a
sickly
yellow
light
over
him
it
did
make
things
any
cheerier
i
flipped
it
off
foster
was
lying
on
his
back
arms
spread
wide
breathing
heavily
maybe
it
was
only
exhaustion
and
he
did
need
a
doctor
after
all
he
probably
wake
up
in
a
little
while
raring
to
go
as
for
me
i
was
feeling
hungry
again
i
have
to
have
a
buck
or
so
for
sandwiches
i
went
over
to
the
bed
and
called
foster
name
he
did
move
if
he
was
sleeping
that
soundly
maybe
i
would
bother
him
i
eased
his
wallet
out
of
his
coat
pocket
took
it
to
the
window
and
checked
it
it
was
fat
i
took
a
ten
put
the
wallet
on
the
table
i
remembered
foster
had
said
something
about
money
in
the
car
i
had
the
keys
in
my
pocket
i
got
my
shoes
on
and
let
myself
out
quietly
foster
had
moved
down
on
the
street
i
waited
for
a
couple
of
yokels
who
were
looking
over
foster
car
to
move
on
then
slid
into
the
seat
leaned
over
and
got
the
floor
boards
up
the
was
set
into
the
channel
of
the
frame
i
scraped
the
road
dirt
off
the
lock
and
opened
it
with
a
key
from
foster
key
ring
took
out
the
contents
there
was
a
bundle
of
stiffish
papers
a
passport
some
maps
marked
up
and
a
wad
of
currency
that
made
my
mouth
go
dry
i
riffled
through
it
fifty
grand
if
it
was
a
buck
i
stuffed
the
papers
money
and
passport
back
in
the
box
and
locked
it
and
climbed
out
onto
the
sidewalk
a
few
doors
down
the
street
there
was
a
dirty
window
lettered
mae
eat
i
went
in
ordered
hamburgers
and
coffee
to
go
and
sat
at
the
counter
with
keys
in
front
of
me
thinking
about
the
car
that
went
with
them
the
passport
only
needed
a
little
work
on
the
picture
to
get
me
wherever
i
wanted
to
go
and
the
money
would
buy
me
my
choice
of
islands
foster
would
have
a
nice
long
nap
and
then
take
a
train
home
with
his
dough
he
hardly
miss
what
i
took
the
counterman
put
a
paper
bag
in
front
of
me
and
i
paid
him
and
went
out
i
stood
by
the
car
jingling
the
keys
on
my
palm
and
thinking
i
could
be
in
miami
in
an
hour
and
i
knew
where
to
go
for
the
passport
job
foster
was
a
nice
guy
and
i
liked
him
but
i
never
have
a
break
like
this
again
i
reached
for
the
car
door
and
a
voice
said
paper
mister
i
jumped
and
looked
around
a
kid
was
looking
at
me
sure
i
said
i
gave
him
a
single
and
took
the
paper
flipped
it
open
a
mayport
dateline
caught
my
eye
police
raid
hideout
a
surprise
raid
by
local
police
led
to
the
discovery
here
today
of
a
secret
gangland
fortress
chief
chesters
of
the
mayport
police
stated
that
the
raid
came
as
an
aftermath
of
the
arrival
in
the
city
yesterday
of
a
notorious
northern
gang
member
a
number
of
firearms
including
machine
guns
were
seized
in
the
raid
on
a
house
miles
from
mayport
on
the
fernandina
road
the
raid
was
said
by
chief
chesters
to
be
the
culmination
of
a
lengthy
investigation
foster
owner
of
the
property
is
missing
and
feared
dead
police
are
seeking
the
who
visited
the
house
last
night
it
is
feared
that
foster
may
have
been
the
victim
of
a
gangland
murder
i
banged
through
the
door
to
the
darkened
room
and
stopped
short
in
the
gloom
i
could
see
foster
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
looking
my
way
look
at
this
i
yelped
flapping
the
paper
in
his
face
now
the
cops
are
dragging
the
state
for
me
and
on
a
murder
rap
at
that
get
on
the
phone
and
get
this
thing
straightened
out
if
you
can
you
and
your
little
green
men
the
cops
think
they
stumbled
on
al
arsenal
you
have
fun
explaining
that
one
foster
looked
at
me
interestedly
he
smiled
what
funny
about
it
foster
i
yelled
your
dough
may
buy
you
out
but
what
about
me
forgive
me
for
asking
foster
said
pleasantly
but
who
are
you
there
are
times
when
i
slow
on
the
uptake
but
this
was
one
of
them
the
implications
of
what
foster
had
said
hit
me
hard
enough
to
make
my
knees
go
weak
oh
no
foster
i
said
you
ca
lose
your
memory
again
not
right
now
not
with
the
police
looking
for
me
you
my
alibi
the
one
that
has
to
explain
all
the
business
about
the
guns
and
the
ad
in
the
paper
i
just
came
to
see
about
a
job
remember
my
voice
was
getting
a
little
shrill
foster
sat
looking
at
me
wearing
an
expression
between
a
frown
and
a
smile
like
a
credit
manager
turning
down
an
application
he
shook
his
head
slightly
my
name
is
not
foster
look
i
said
your
name
was
foster
yesterday
that
all
i
care
about
you
the
one
that
owns
the
house
the
cops
are
all
upset
about
and
you
the
corpse
i
supposed
to
have
knocked
off
you
got
to
go
to
the
cops
with
me
right
now
and
tell
them
i
just
an
innocent
bystander
i
went
to
the
window
and
raised
the
shades
to
let
some
light
into
the
room
turned
back
to
foster
i
explain
to
the
cops
about
you
thinking
the
little
men
were
after
you
i
stopped
talking
and
stared
at
foster
for
a
wild
moment
i
thought
i
made
a
mistake
that
i
wandered
into
the
wrong
room
i
knew
foster
face
all
right
the
light
was
bright
enough
now
to
see
clearly
but
the
man
i
was
talking
to
could
have
been
a
day
over
twenty
years
old
i
went
close
to
him
staring
hard
there
were
the
same
cool
blue
eyes
but
the
lines
around
them
were
gone
the
black
hair
grew
lower
and
thicker
than
i
remembered
it
and
the
skin
was
clear
i
sat
down
hard
on
my
bed
i
said
es
la
dificultad
foster
said
shut
up
i
moaned
i
confused
enough
in
one
language
i
was
trying
hard
to
think
but
i
could
seem
to
get
started
a
few
minutes
earlier
i
had
the
world
by
the
tail
just
before
it
turned
around
and
bit
me
cold
sweat
popped
out
on
my
forehead
when
i
thought
about
how
close
i
had
come
to
driving
off
in
foster
car
every
cop
in
the
state
would
be
looking
for
it
by
now
and
if
they
found
me
in
it
the
jury
would
be
out
ten
minutes
reaching
a
verdict
of
guilty
then
another
thought
hit
me
the
kind
that
brings
you
bolt
upright
with
your
teeth
clenched
and
your
heart
hammering
it
would
be
long
before
the
local
hick
cops
would
notice
the
car
out
front
they
come
in
after
me
and
i
tell
them
it
belonged
to
foster
they
take
a
look
at
him
and
say
nuts
the
bird
we
want
is
fifty
years
old
and
where
did
you
hide
the
body
i
got
up
and
started
pacing
foster
had
already
told
me
there
was
nothing
to
connect
him
with
his
house
in
mayport
the
locals
there
had
seen
enough
of
him
to
know
he
was
pushing
middle
age
at
least
i
could
kick
and
scream
and
tell
them
this
kid
was
foster
but
i
never
make
it
stick
there
was
no
way
to
prove
my
story
figure
foster
was
dead
and
that
i
killed
him
and
anybody
who
thinks
you
need
a
to
prove
murder
better
read
his
perry
mason
again
i
glanced
out
of
the
window
and
did
a
double
take
two
cops
were
standing
by
foster
car
one
of
them
went
around
to
the
back
and
got
out
a
pad
and
took
down
the
license
number
then
said
something
over
his
shoulder
and
started
across
the
street
the
second
cop
planted
himself
by
the
car
his
eye
on
the
front
of
the
hotel
i
whirled
on
foster
get
your
shoes
on
i
croked
let
get
the
hell
out
of
here
we
went
down
the
stairs
quietly
and
found
a
back
door
opening
on
an
alley
nobody
saw
us
go
an
hour
later
i
sagged
in
a
grimy
coach
seat
and
studied
foster
sitting
across
from
me
a
nut
with
the
face
of
a
young
kid
and
a
mind
like
a
blank
slate
i
had
no
choice
but
to
drag
him
with
me
my
only
chance
was
to
stick
close
and
hope
he
got
back
enough
of
his
memory
to
get
me
off
the
hook
it
was
time
for
me
to
be
figuring
my
next
move
i
thought
about
the
fifty
thousand
dollars
i
had
left
behind
in
the
car
and
groaned
foster
looked
concerned
are
you
in
pain
he
said
and
how
i
in
pain
i
said
before
i
met
you
i
was
a
homeless
bum
broke
and
hungry
now
i
can
add
a
couple
more
items
the
cops
are
after
me
and
i
got
a
mental
case
to
nursemaid
what
law
have
you
broken
foster
said
none
i
barked
as
a
crook
i
a
washout
i
planned
three
larcenies
in
the
last
twelve
hours
and
flunked
out
on
all
of
them
and
now
i
wanted
for
murder
whom
did
you
kill
foster
inquired
courteously
i
leaned
across
so
i
could
snarl
in
his
face
you
then
get
this
through
your
head
foster
the
only
crime
i
guilty
of
is
stupidity
i
listened
to
your
crazy
story
because
of
you
i
in
a
mess
i
never
get
straightened
out
i
leaned
back
and
then
there
the
question
of
old
men
that
take
a
nap
and
wake
up
in
their
late
teens
we
go
into
that
later
after
i
had
my
nervous
breakdown
i
sorry
if
i
been
the
cause
of
difficulty
foster
said
i
wish
that
i
could
recall
the
things
you
spoken
of
is
there
anything
i
can
do
to
assist
you
now
and
you
were
the
one
who
wanted
help
i
said
there
is
one
thing
let
me
have
the
money
you
got
on
you
we
need
it
foster
got
out
his
wallet
after
i
told
him
where
it
was
and
handed
it
to
me
i
looked
through
it
there
was
nothing
in
it
with
a
photo
or
fingerprints
when
foster
said
he
had
arranged
matters
so
that
he
could
disappear
without
a
trace
he
had
been
kidding
we
go
to
miami
i
said
i
know
a
place
in
the
cuban
section
where
we
can
lie
low
cheap
maybe
if
we
wait
a
while
you
start
remembering
things
yes
foster
said
that
would
be
pleasant
you
have
forgotten
how
to
talk
at
least
i
said
i
wonder
what
else
you
can
do
do
you
remember
how
you
made
all
that
money
i
can
remember
nothing
of
your
economic
system
foster
said
he
looked
around
this
is
a
very
primitive
world
in
many
respects
he
said
it
should
not
be
difficult
to
amass
wealth
here
i
never
had
much
luck
at
it
i
said
i
have
even
been
able
to
amass
the
price
of
a
meal
food
is
exchanged
for
money
foster
asked
everything
is
exchanged
for
money
i
said
including
most
of
the
human
virtues
this
is
a
strange
world
foster
said
it
will
take
me
a
long
while
to
become
accustomed
to
it
yeah
me
too
i
said
maybe
things
would
be
better
on
mars
foster
nodded
perhaps
he
said
perhaps
we
should
go
there
i
groaned
then
caught
myself
no
i
not
in
pain
i
said
but
do
take
me
so
literally
foster
we
rode
along
in
silence
for
a
while
say
foster
i
said
have
you
still
got
that
notebook
of
yours
foster
tried
several
pockets
came
up
with
the
book
he
looked
at
it
turned
it
over
frowning
you
remember
it
i
said
watching
him
he
shook
his
head
slowly
then
ran
his
finger
around
the
circles
embossed
on
the
cover
this
pattern
he
said
it
signifies
go
on
foster
i
said
signifies
what
i
sorry
he
said
i
do
remember
i
took
the
book
and
sat
looking
at
it
i
did
really
see
it
though
i
was
seeing
my
future
when
foster
did
turn
up
they
naturally
assume
he
was
dead
i
been
with
him
just
before
his
disappearance
it
was
hard
to
see
why
they
want
to
talk
to
me
and
my
having
vanished
too
would
help
any
my
picture
would
blossom
out
in
post
offices
all
over
the
country
and
even
if
they
did
catch
me
right
away
the
murder
charge
would
always
be
there
hanging
over
me
it
would
do
any
good
to
turn
myself
in
and
tell
them
the
whole
story
they
would
believe
me
and
i
would
blame
them
i
really
believe
it
myself
and
i
lived
through
it
but
then
maybe
i
was
just
imagining
that
foster
looked
younger
after
all
a
good
night
rest
i
looked
at
foster
and
almost
groaned
again
twenty
was
stretching
it
eighteen
was
more
like
it
i
was
willing
to
swear
he
never
shaved
in
his
life
foster
i
said
it
got
to
be
in
this
book
who
you
are
where
you
came
from
it
the
only
hope
i
got
i
suggest
we
read
it
then
foster
said
a
bright
idea
i
said
why
did
i
think
of
that
i
thumbed
through
the
book
to
the
section
in
english
and
read
for
an
hour
starting
with
the
entry
dated
january
the
writer
had
scribbled
a
few
lines
every
few
months
he
seemed
to
be
some
kind
of
pioneer
in
the
virginia
colony
he
complained
about
prices
and
the
indians
and
the
ignorance
of
the
other
settlers
and
every
now
and
then
threw
in
a
remark
about
the
enemy
he
often
took
long
trips
and
when
he
got
home
he
complained
about
those
too
it
a
funny
thing
foster
i
said
this
is
supposed
to
have
been
written
over
a
period
of
a
couple
of
hundred
years
but
it
all
in
the
same
hand
that
kind
of
odd
is
it
why
should
a
man
handwriting
change
foster
said
well
it
might
get
a
little
shaky
there
toward
the
last
do
you
agree
why
is
that
i
spell
it
out
foster
i
said
most
people
do
live
that
long
a
hundred
years
is
stretching
it
to
say
nothing
of
two
this
must
be
a
very
violent
world
then
foster
said
skip
it
i
said
you
talk
like
you
just
visiting
by
the
way
do
you
remember
how
to
write
foster
looked
thoughtful
yes
he
said
i
can
write
i
handed
him
the
book
and
the
stylus
try
it
i
said
foster
opened
to
a
blank
page
wrote
and
handed
the
book
back
to
me
always
and
always
and
always
i
read
i
looked
at
foster
what
does
that
mean
i
looked
at
the
words
again
then
quickly
flipped
to
the
pages
written
in
english
i
was
no
expert
on
penmanship
but
this
came
up
and
cracked
me
right
in
the
eye
the
book
was
written
in
foster
hand
it
does
make
sense
i
was
saying
for
the
fortieth
time
foster
nodded
sympathetic
agreement
why
would
you
write
out
this
junk
yourself
and
then
spend
all
that
time
and
money
trying
to
have
it
deciphered
you
said
experts
worked
over
it
and
could
break
it
but
i
went
on
you
must
have
known
you
wrote
it
you
knew
your
own
handwriting
but
on
the
other
hand
you
had
amnesia
before
you
had
the
idea
you
might
have
told
something
about
yourself
in
the
book
i
sighed
leaned
back
and
tossed
the
book
over
to
foster
here
you
read
a
while
i
said
i
arguing
with
myself
and
i
ca
tell
winning
foster
looked
the
book
over
carefully
this
is
odd
he
said
what
odd
the
book
is
made
of
khaff
it
is
a
permanent
material
and
yet
it
shows
damage
i
sat
perfectly
still
and
waited
here
on
the
back
cover
foster
said
a
scuffed
area
since
this
is
khaff
it
can
not
be
an
actual
scar
it
must
have
been
placed
there
i
grabbed
the
book
and
looked
there
was
a
faint
mark
across
the
back
cover
as
though
the
book
had
been
scraped
on
something
sharp
i
remembered
how
much
luck
i
had
had
with
a
knife
the
mark
had
been
put
here
disguised
as
a
casual
nick
in
the
finish
it
had
to
mean
something
how
do
you
know
what
the
material
is
i
asked
foster
looked
surprised
in
the
same
way
that
i
know
the
window
is
of
glass
he
said
i
simply
know
speaking
of
glass
i
said
wait
till
i
get
my
hands
on
a
microscope
then
maybe
we
begin
to
get
some
answers
chapter
iv
the
pound
señorita
with
the
wart
on
her
upper
lip
put
a
pot
of
black
cuban
coffee
and
a
pitcher
of
salted
milk
down
beside
the
two
chipped
cups
leered
at
me
in
a
way
that
might
have
been
appealing
thirty
years
before
and
waddled
back
to
the
kitchen
i
poured
a
cup
gulped
half
of
it
and
shuddered
in
the
street
outside
the
cafe
a
guitar
cried
okay
foster
i
said
here
what
i
got
the
first
half
of
the
book
is
in
i
ca
read
that
but
this
middle
section
the
part
coded
in
regular
letters
it
actually
encrypted
english
a
sort
of
résumé
of
what
happened
i
picked
up
the
sheets
of
paper
on
which
i
had
transcribed
my
deciphering
of
the
coded
section
of
the
book
using
the
key
that
had
been
in
the
fake
scratch
on
the
back
cover
i
read
the
first
time
i
am
afraid
my
attempt
to
construct
the
communicator
called
down
the
hunters
upon
me
i
made
such
a
shield
as
i
could
contrive
and
sought
their
nesting
came
there
and
it
was
in
that
place
that
i
knew
of
old
and
it
was
no
hive
but
a
pit
in
the
ground
built
by
men
of
the
two
worlds
and
i
would
have
come
into
it
but
the
hunters
swarmed
in
their
multitudes
i
fought
them
and
killed
many
but
at
last
i
fled
away
i
came
to
the
western
shore
and
there
i
hired
bold
sailors
and
a
poor
craft
and
set
days
we
came
to
shore
in
this
wilderness
and
there
were
men
as
from
the
dawn
of
time
and
i
fought
them
and
when
they
had
learned
fear
i
lived
among
them
in
peace
and
the
hunters
have
not
found
this
place
now
it
may
be
that
my
saga
ends
here
but
i
will
do
what
i
am
change
may
soon
come
upon
me
i
must
prepare
for
the
stranger
who
will
come
after
me
all
that
he
must
know
is
in
these
pages
and
say
i
to
him
patience
for
the
time
of
this
race
draws
close
venture
not
again
on
the
eastern
continent
but
wait
for
soon
the
northern
sailors
must
come
in
numbers
into
this
wilderness
seek
out
their
cleverest
and
when
it
may
be
devise
a
shield
and
only
then
return
to
the
pit
of
the
hunters
it
lies
in
the
plain
parts
of
the
girth
of
this
to
the
west
of
the
great
chalk
face
and
parts
north
from
the
median
line
as
i
reckon
the
stones
mark
it
well
with
the
sign
of
the
two
i
looked
across
at
foster
it
goes
on
then
with
a
account
of
dealings
with
aborigines
he
was
trying
to
get
them
civilized
in
a
hurry
they
figured
he
was
a
god
and
he
set
them
to
work
building
roads
and
cutting
stone
and
learning
mathematics
and
so
on
he
was
doing
all
he
could
to
set
things
up
so
this
stranger
who
was
to
follow
him
would
know
the
score
and
carry
on
the
good
work
foster
eyes
were
on
my
face
what
is
the
nature
of
the
change
he
speaks
of
he
never
says
but
i
suppose
he
talking
about
death
i
said
i
do
know
where
the
stranger
is
supposed
to
come
from
listen
to
me
legion
foster
said
there
was
a
hint
of
the
old
anxious
look
in
his
eyes
i
think
i
know
what
the
change
was
i
think
he
knew
he
would
forget
you
got
amnesia
on
the
brain
old
buddy
i
and
the
stranger
is
himself
a
man
without
a
memory
i
sat
frowning
at
foster
yeah
maybe
i
said
go
on
and
he
says
that
all
that
the
stranger
needs
to
know
is
there
in
the
book
not
in
the
part
i
decoded
i
said
he
describes
how
they
coming
along
with
the
job
and
how
the
new
mine
panned
out
but
there
nothing
about
what
the
hunters
are
or
what
had
gone
on
before
he
tangled
with
them
the
first
time
it
must
be
there
legion
but
in
the
first
section
the
part
written
in
alien
symbols
maybe
i
said
but
why
the
hell
did
he
give
us
a
key
to
that
part
i
think
he
assumed
that
the
stranger
himself
would
remember
the
old
writing
foster
said
how
could
he
know
that
it
would
be
forgotten
with
the
rest
your
guess
is
as
good
as
any
i
said
maybe
better
you
know
how
it
feels
to
lose
your
memory
but
we
learned
a
few
things
foster
said
the
pit
of
the
hunters
we
have
the
location
if
you
call
this
thousand
parts
to
the
west
of
chalk
face
a
location
i
said
we
know
more
than
that
foster
said
he
mentions
a
plain
and
it
must
lie
on
a
continent
to
the
east
if
you
assume
that
he
sailed
from
europe
to
america
then
the
continent
to
the
east
would
be
europe
i
said
but
maybe
he
went
from
africa
to
south
america
or
the
mention
of
northern
sailors
that
suggests
the
vikings
you
seem
to
know
a
little
history
foster
i
said
you
got
a
lot
of
odd
facts
tucked
away
we
need
maps
foster
said
we
look
for
a
plain
near
the
sea
not
necessarily
and
with
a
formation
called
a
chalk
face
to
the
east
what
this
line
business
i
said
and
the
bit
about
ten
thousand
parts
of
something
i
do
know
but
we
must
have
maps
i
bought
some
this
afternoon
i
said
i
also
got
a
globe
i
figured
we
might
need
them
let
get
out
of
this
and
back
to
the
room
where
we
can
spread
out
i
know
it
a
grim
prospect
but
i
got
to
my
feet
dropped
some
coins
on
the
table
and
led
the
way
out
it
was
a
short
half
block
to
the
flea
trap
we
called
home
we
kept
out
of
it
as
much
as
we
could
holding
our
long
daily
conferences
across
the
street
at
the
novedades
the
roaches
scurried
as
we
passed
up
the
dark
stairway
to
our
not
much
brighter
room
i
crossed
to
the
bureau
and
opened
a
drawer
the
globe
foster
said
taking
it
in
his
hands
i
wonder
if
perhaps
he
meant
a
part
of
the
circumference
of
the
earth
what
would
he
know
about
disregard
the
anachronistic
aspect
of
it
foster
said
the
man
who
wrote
the
book
knew
many
things
we
have
to
start
with
some
assumptions
let
make
the
obvious
ones
that
we
looking
for
a
plain
on
the
west
coast
of
europe
lying
he
pulled
a
chair
up
to
the
scabrous
table
and
riffled
through
to
one
of
my
scribbled
sheets
of
the
circumference
of
the
earth
that
would
be
about
miles
west
of
a
chalk
formation
and
miles
north
of
a
median
line
maybe
i
said
he
means
the
equator
certainly
why
not
that
would
mean
our
plain
lies
on
a
line
through
he
studied
the
small
globe
warsaw
and
south
of
amsterdam
but
this
part
about
a
rock
outcropping
i
said
how
do
we
find
out
if
there
any
conspicuous
chalk
formation
around
there
we
can
consult
a
geology
text
there
may
be
a
library
in
this
neighborhood
the
only
chalk
deposits
i
ever
heard
about
i
said
are
the
white
cliffs
of
dover
white
cliffs
we
both
reached
for
the
globe
at
once
one
hundred
miles
west
of
the
chalk
cliffs
said
foster
he
ran
a
finger
over
the
globe
north
of
london
but
south
of
birmingham
that
puts
us
reasonably
near
the
sea
where
the
atlas
i
said
i
rummaged
came
up
with
a
cheap
edition
flipped
the
pages
here
england
i
said
now
we
look
for
a
plain
foster
put
a
finger
on
the
map
here
he
said
a
large
plain
called
salisbury
large
is
right
i
said
it
would
take
years
to
find
a
stone
cairn
on
that
we
getting
excited
about
nothing
we
looking
for
a
hole
in
the
ground
hundreds
of
years
old
if
this
lousy
notebook
means
anything
maybe
marked
with
a
few
stones
in
the
middle
of
miles
of
plain
and
it
all
guesswork
anyway
i
took
the
atlas
turned
the
page
i
do
know
what
i
expected
to
get
out
of
decoding
those
pages
i
said
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
than
this
i
think
we
should
try
legion
foster
said
we
can
go
there
search
over
the
ground
it
would
be
costly
but
not
impossible
we
can
start
by
gathering
capital
wait
a
minute
foster
i
said
i
was
staring
at
a
map
showing
southern
england
suddenly
my
heart
was
thudding
i
put
a
finger
on
a
tiny
dot
in
the
center
of
salisbury
plain
six
two
and
even
i
said
there
your
pit
of
the
hunters
foster
leaned
over
read
the
fine
print
stonehenge
i
read
from
the
encyclopedia
page
great
stone
structure
lying
on
the
plain
of
salisbury
wiltshire
england
is
among
megalithic
monuments
of
the
ancient
world
within
a
circular
ditch
in
diameter
stones
up
to
in
height
are
arranged
in
concentric
circles
the
central
altar
stone
over
long
is
approached
from
the
northeast
by
a
broad
roadway
called
the
it
is
not
an
altar
said
foster
how
do
you
know
because
foster
frowned
i
know
that
all
the
journal
said
the
stones
were
arranged
in
the
sign
of
the
two
worlds
i
said
that
means
the
concentric
circles
i
suppose
the
same
thing
that
stamped
on
the
cover
of
the
notebook
and
the
ring
foster
said
let
me
read
the
rest
great
sarsen
stone
stands
upright
in
the
avenue
the
axis
through
the
two
stones
when
erected
pointed
directly
to
the
rising
of
the
sun
on
midsummer
day
calculations
based
on
this
observation
indicate
a
date
of
approximately
foster
took
the
book
and
i
sat
on
the
window
sill
and
looked
out
at
a
big
florida
moon
over
the
ragged
line
of
roofs
with
a
skinny
royal
palm
sticking
up
in
silhouette
it
did
look
much
like
the
postcard
views
of
miami
i
lit
a
cigarette
and
thought
about
a
man
who
long
ago
had
crossed
the
north
atlantic
in
a
dragon
boat
to
be
a
god
among
the
indians
i
wondered
where
he
came
from
and
what
it
was
he
was
looking
for
and
what
kept
him
going
in
spite
of
the
hell
that
showed
in
the
spare
lines
of
the
journal
he
kept
if
i
reminded
myself
he
had
ever
existed
foster
was
poring
over
the
book
look
i
said
let
get
back
to
earth
we
have
things
to
think
about
plans
to
make
the
fairy
tales
can
wait
until
later
what
do
you
suggest
foster
said
that
we
forget
the
things
told
me
and
the
things
we
read
here
discard
the
journal
and
abandon
the
attempt
to
find
the
answers
no
i
said
i
no
sorehead
sure
there
some
things
here
that
somebody
ought
to
look
into
some
day
but
right
now
what
i
want
is
the
cops
off
my
neck
and
i
been
thinking
i
dictate
a
letter
you
write
it
your
lawyers
know
your
handwriting
tell
them
you
were
on
the
thin
edge
of
a
nervous
breakdown
that
why
all
the
artillery
around
your
house
and
you
made
up
your
mind
suddenly
to
get
away
from
it
all
tell
them
you
do
want
to
be
bothered
that
why
you
travelling
incognito
and
that
the
northern
mobster
that
came
to
see
you
was
just
stupid
not
a
killer
that
ought
to
at
least
cool
off
the
cops
foster
looked
thoughtful
that
an
excellent
suggestion
he
said
then
we
need
merely
to
arrange
for
passage
to
england
and
proceed
with
the
investigation
you
do
get
the
idea
i
said
you
can
arrange
things
by
mail
so
we
get
our
hands
on
that
dough
of
yours
any
such
attempt
would
merely
bring
the
police
down
on
us
foster
said
you
already
pointed
out
the
unwisdom
of
attempting
to
pass
myself
off
as
myself
there
ought
to
be
a
way
i
said
we
have
only
one
avenue
of
inquiry
foster
said
we
have
no
choice
but
to
explore
it
we
take
passage
on
a
ship
to
england
what
we
use
for
money
and
papers
it
would
cost
hundreds
unless
i
added
we
worked
our
way
but
that
no
good
still
need
passports
plus
union
cards
and
seamen
tickets
your
friend
foster
said
the
one
who
prepares
passports
ca
he
produce
the
other
papers
as
well
yeah
i
said
i
guess
so
but
it
will
cost
us
i
sure
we
can
find
a
way
to
pay
foster
said
will
you
see
him
early
in
the
morning
i
looked
around
the
blowsy
room
hot
night
air
stirred
a
geranium
wilting
in
a
tin
can
on
the
window
sill
an
odor
of
bad
cooking
and
worse
plumbing
floated
up
from
the
street
at
least
i
said
it
would
mean
getting
out
of
here
chapter
v
it
was
almost
sundown
when
foster
and
i
pushed
through
the
door
to
the
saloon
bar
at
the
ancient
sinner
and
found
a
corner
table
i
watched
foster
spread
out
his
maps
and
papers
behind
us
there
was
a
murmur
of
conversation
and
the
thump
of
darts
against
a
board
when
are
you
going
to
give
up
and
admit
we
wasting
our
time
i
said
two
weeks
of
tramping
over
the
same
ground
and
we
end
up
in
the
same
place
we
hardly
begun
our
investigation
foster
said
mildly
you
keep
saying
that
i
said
but
if
there
ever
was
anything
in
that
it
long
gone
the
archaeologists
have
been
digging
over
the
site
for
years
and
they
have
come
up
with
anything
they
do
know
what
to
look
for
foster
said
they
were
searching
for
indications
of
religious
significance
human
sacrifice
that
sort
of
thing
we
do
know
what
we
looking
for
either
i
said
unless
you
think
maybe
we
meet
the
hunters
hiding
under
a
loose
stone
you
say
that
sardonically
foster
said
but
i
do
consider
it
impossible
i
know
i
said
you
convinced
yourself
that
the
hunters
were
after
us
back
at
mayport
when
we
ran
off
like
a
pair
of
idiots
from
what
you
told
me
of
the
circumstances
foster
began
i
know
you
do
consider
it
impossible
that
the
trouble
with
you
you
do
consider
anything
impossible
it
would
make
life
a
lot
easier
for
me
if
you
let
me
rule
out
a
few
items
like
leprechauns
who
hang
out
at
stonehenge
foster
looked
at
me
it
had
only
been
a
few
weeks
since
he
woke
up
from
a
nap
looking
like
a
senior
class
president
who
made
up
his
mind
whether
to
be
a
preacher
or
a
movie
star
but
he
had
already
lost
that
mild
innocent
air
he
learned
fast
and
day
by
day
i
had
seen
his
old
personality
reemerge
and
in
spite
of
my
attempts
to
hold
onto
the
ascendency
dominate
our
partnership
it
a
failing
of
your
culture
foster
said
that
hypothesis
becomes
dogma
almost
overnight
you
too
close
to
your
neolithic
when
the
blind
acceptance
of
tribal
lore
had
survival
value
having
learned
to
evoke
the
fire
god
from
sticks
by
rote
you
tend
to
extend
the
principle
to
all
facts
here
an
established
fact
for
you
i
said
we
got
fifteen
pounds
left
that
about
forty
dollars
it
time
we
figure
out
where
to
go
from
here
before
somebody
starts
checking
up
on
those
phoney
papers
of
ours
foster
shook
his
head
i
not
satisfied
that
we
exhausted
the
possibilities
here
i
been
studying
the
geometric
relationships
between
the
various
structures
i
have
some
ideas
i
want
to
check
i
think
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
go
out
at
night
when
we
can
work
without
the
usual
crowd
of
tourists
observing
every
move
i
groaned
my
dogs
are
killing
me
i
said
let
hope
you
come
up
with
something
better
or
at
least
different
we
have
a
bite
to
eat
here
and
wait
until
dark
to
start
out
foster
said
the
publican
brought
us
plates
of
cold
meat
and
potato
salad
i
worked
on
a
thin
but
durable
slice
of
ham
and
thought
about
all
the
people
somewhere
who
were
sitting
down
now
to
gracious
meals
in
the
glitter
of
crystal
and
silver
i
had
too
many
greasy
french
fries
in
too
many
cheap
dives
the
last
few
years
i
could
feel
them
all
now
burning
in
my
stomach
i
was
getting
farther
from
my
island
all
the
time
and
it
was
nobody
fault
but
mine
the
ancient
sinner
i
said
that
me
foster
looked
up
curious
names
these
old
pubs
have
he
said
i
suppose
in
some
cases
the
origins
are
lost
in
antiquity
why
do
they
think
up
something
cheery
i
said
like
paradise
bar
and
grill
or
happy
hour
cafe
did
you
notice
the
sign
hanging
outside
no
a
picture
of
a
skeleton
he
holding
one
hand
up
like
a
yankee
evangelist
prophesying
doom
you
can
see
it
through
the
window
there
foster
turned
and
looked
out
at
the
weathered
sign
creaking
in
the
evening
wind
he
looked
at
it
for
a
long
time
when
he
turned
back
there
was
a
strange
look
around
his
eyes
what
the
matter
i
started
foster
ignored
me
waved
to
the
proprietor
a
short
fat
country
man
he
came
over
to
the
table
wiping
his
hands
on
his
apron
a
very
interesting
old
building
foster
said
we
been
admiring
it
when
was
it
built
well
sir
the
publican
said
this
here
house
is
a
many
a
hundred
year
old
it
were
built
by
the
monks
they
say
from
the
monastery
what
used
to
stand
nearby
here
it
were
tore
down
by
the
king
men
henry
that
was
what
time
he
drove
the
papists
out
that
would
be
henry
the
eighth
i
suppose
aye
it
would
that
and
this
house
is
all
that
were
spared
it
being
the
as
the
king
said
were
a
worthwhile
institution
and
he
laid
on
a
tithe
that
two
kegs
of
stout
was
to
be
laid
by
for
the
king
use
each
brewing
time
very
interesting
foster
said
is
the
custom
still
continued
the
publican
shook
his
head
it
were
ended
in
my
granfer
time
it
being
that
the
queen
were
a
teetotaller
how
did
it
acquire
the
curious
name
ancient
sinner
the
tale
is
the
publican
said
that
one
day
a
lay
brother
of
the
order
were
digging
about
yonder
on
the
plain
by
the
great
stones
in
search
of
the
druid
treasure
albeit
the
abbot
had
forbid
him
to
go
nigh
the
heathen
ground
and
he
come
on
the
bones
of
a
man
and
being
of
a
kindly
turn
he
had
the
thought
to
give
them
christian
burial
now
knowing
the
abbott
would
nae
permit
it
he
set
to
work
to
dig
a
grave
by
moonlight
in
holy
ground
under
the
monastery
walls
but
the
abbott
being
wakeful
were
abroad
and
come
on
the
brother
and
when
he
asked
the
why
of
it
the
lay
brother
having
visions
of
penances
to
burden
him
for
many
a
day
he
ups
and
tells
the
abbott
it
were
a
ale
cellar
he
were
about
digging
and
the
abbott
not
being
without
wisdom
clapped
him
on
the
back
and
went
on
his
way
and
so
it
was
the
got
built
and
blessed
by
the
abbott
and
with
it
the
bones
that
was
laid
away
under
the
floor
beneath
the
so
the
ancient
sinner
is
buried
under
the
floor
aye
so
the
tale
goes
though
i
not
dug
for
him
meself
but
the
house
has
been
knowed
by
the
name
these
four
hundred
years
where
was
it
you
said
the
lay
brother
was
digging
on
the
plain
yonder
by
the
druid
stones
what
they
call
stonehenge
the
publican
said
he
picked
up
the
empty
glasses
what
about
another
gentlemen
certainly
foster
said
he
sat
quietly
across
from
me
his
features
composed
but
i
could
see
there
was
tension
under
the
surface
calm
what
this
all
about
i
asked
softly
when
did
you
get
so
interested
in
local
history
later
foster
murmured
keep
looking
bored
that
be
easy
i
said
the
publican
came
back
and
placed
heavy
glass
mugs
before
us
you
were
telling
us
about
the
lay
brother
finding
the
bones
foster
said
you
say
they
were
buried
in
stonehenge
the
publican
cleared
his
throat
glanced
sideways
at
foster
the
gentlemen
wouldna
be
from
the
university
now
i
suppose
he
said
let
just
say
foster
said
easily
smiling
that
we
have
a
great
interest
in
these
bits
of
lore
an
interest
supported
by
modest
funds
of
course
the
publican
made
a
show
of
wiping
at
the
rings
on
the
table
top
a
costly
business
i
wager
he
said
digging
about
in
odd
places
and
all
now
knowing
where
to
dig
that
important
i
be
bound
very
important
foster
said
worth
five
pounds
easily
my
granfer
told
me
of
the
spot
took
me
out
by
moonlight
he
did
and
showed
me
where
his
granfer
had
showed
him
told
me
it
were
a
fine
great
secret
the
likes
of
which
a
simple
man
could
well
take
pride
in
and
an
additional
five
pounds
as
a
token
of
my
personal
esteem
foster
said
the
publican
eyed
me
well
a
secret
as
was
handed
down
father
to
son
and
of
course
my
associate
wishes
to
express
his
esteem
too
foster
said
another
five
pounds
worth
that
all
the
esteem
the
budget
will
bear
foster
i
said
i
got
out
the
fifteen
pounds
and
passed
the
money
across
to
him
i
hope
you
have
forgotten
those
people
back
home
who
wanted
to
talk
to
us
i
said
they
be
getting
in
touch
with
us
any
time
now
i
bet
foster
rolled
up
the
bills
and
held
them
in
his
hand
that
true
legion
he
said
perhaps
we
should
take
the
time
but
being
it
for
the
advancement
of
science
the
publican
said
i
willing
to
make
the
sacrifice
we
want
to
go
out
tonight
foster
said
we
have
a
very
tight
schedule
the
landlord
dickered
with
foster
for
another
five
minutes
before
he
agreed
to
guide
us
to
the
spot
where
the
skeleton
had
been
found
when
he
left
i
began
now
tell
me
look
at
the
signboard
again
foster
said
i
looked
the
skull
smiled
holding
up
a
hand
i
see
it
i
said
but
it
does
explain
why
you
handed
over
our
last
buck
look
at
the
hand
look
at
the
ring
on
the
finger
i
looked
again
a
heavy
ring
was
painted
on
the
bony
index
finger
with
a
pattern
of
concentric
circles
it
was
a
duplicate
of
the
one
on
foster
finger
the
publican
pulled
the
battered
morris
minor
to
the
side
of
the
highway
and
set
the
brake
this
is
as
close
as
we
best
take
the
machine
he
said
we
got
out
looked
across
the
rolling
plain
where
the
megaliths
of
stonehenge
loomed
against
the
last
glow
of
sunset
the
publican
rummaged
in
the
boot
produced
a
ragged
blanket
and
two
long
flashlights
gave
one
to
foster
and
the
other
to
me
do
nae
use
the
electric
torches
until
i
tell
ye
he
said
lest
the
whole
county
see
there
folks
abroad
here
we
watched
as
he
draped
the
blanket
over
a
barbed
wire
fence
clambered
over
and
started
across
the
barren
field
foster
and
i
followed
not
talking
the
plain
was
deserted
a
few
lonely
lights
showed
on
a
distant
slope
it
was
a
dark
night
with
no
moon
i
could
hardly
see
the
ground
ahead
a
car
moved
along
a
distant
road
its
headlights
bobbing
we
moved
past
the
outer
ring
of
stones
skirting
fallen
slabs
twenty
feet
long
we
break
our
necks
i
said
let
have
one
of
the
flashlights
not
yet
foster
whispered
our
guide
paused
we
came
up
to
him
it
were
a
mortal
long
time
since
i
were
last
hereabouts
he
said
i
best
take
me
bearings
off
the
friar
heel
what
that
yon
great
stone
standing
alone
in
the
avenue
we
squinted
it
was
barely
visible
as
a
dark
shape
against
the
sky
the
bones
were
buried
there
foster
asked
nay
all
by
theirself
they
was
now
it
were
twenty
paces
granfer
said
him
bein
fifteen
stone
and
long
in
the
leg
the
publican
muttered
to
himself
pacing
off
distances
what
to
keep
him
from
just
pointing
to
a
spot
after
a
while
i
said
to
foster
and
saying
is
it
we
wait
and
see
foster
said
they
were
a
hollow
as
it
were
in
the
earth
the
publican
said
with
a
bit
of
stone
by
it
i
reckon
it
were
fifty
paces
from
here
he
pointed
yonder
i
do
see
anything
i
said
let
take
a
closer
look
foster
started
off
and
i
followed
the
publican
trailing
behind
i
made
out
a
dim
shape
with
a
deep
depression
in
the
earth
before
it
this
could
be
the
spot
foster
said
old
graves
often
sink
suddenly
he
grabbed
my
arm
look
the
surface
of
the
ground
before
us
seemed
to
tremble
then
heave
foster
snapped
on
his
flashlight
the
earth
at
the
bottom
of
the
hollow
rose
cracked
open
a
boiling
mass
of
luminescence
churned
and
a
globe
of
light
separated
itself
rose
bumbling
along
the
face
of
the
weathered
stone
saints
preserve
us
the
publican
said
in
a
choked
voice
foster
and
i
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
watching
the
lone
globe
rose
higher
and
abruptly
shot
straight
toward
us
foster
threw
up
an
arm
and
ducked
the
ball
of
light
veered
struck
him
a
glancing
blow
darted
off
a
few
yards
hovered
in
an
instant
the
air
was
alive
with
the
spheres
boiling
up
from
the
ground
and
hurtling
toward
us
buzzing
like
a
hive
of
foster
flashlight
lanced
out
toward
the
swarm
use
your
light
legion
he
shouted
hoarsely
i
was
still
standing
frozen
the
globes
rushed
straight
at
foster
ignoring
me
behind
me
i
heard
the
publican
turn
and
run
i
fumbled
with
the
flashlight
switch
snapped
it
on
swung
the
beam
of
white
light
on
foster
the
globe
at
his
head
vanished
as
the
light
touched
it
more
globes
swarmed
to
foster
and
popped
like
soap
bubbles
in
the
flashlight
glare
but
more
swarmed
to
take
their
places
foster
reeled
fighting
at
them
he
swung
the
light
and
i
heard
it
smash
against
the
stone
behind
him
in
the
instant
darkness
the
globes
clustered
thick
around
his
head
foster
i
yelled
run
he
got
no
more
than
five
yards
before
he
staggered
went
to
his
knees
cover
he
croaked
he
fell
on
his
face
i
rushed
the
mass
of
darting
globes
took
up
a
stance
straddling
his
body
a
sulphurous
reek
hung
around
me
i
coughed
concentrated
on
beaming
the
lights
around
foster
head
no
more
were
rising
from
the
crack
in
the
earth
now
a
suffocating
cloud
pressed
around
both
of
us
but
it
was
foster
they
went
for
i
thought
of
the
slab
if
i
could
get
my
back
to
it
i
might
have
a
chance
i
stooped
got
a
grip
on
foster
coat
and
started
back
dragging
him
the
lights
boiled
around
me
i
swept
the
beam
of
light
and
kept
going
until
my
back
slammed
against
the
stone
i
crouched
against
it
now
they
could
only
come
from
the
front
i
glanced
at
the
cleft
the
lights
had
come
from
it
looked
big
enough
to
get
foster
into
that
would
give
him
some
protection
i
tumbled
him
over
the
edge
then
flattened
my
back
against
the
slab
and
settled
down
to
fight
in
earnest
i
worked
in
a
pattern
sweeping
vertically
then
horizontally
the
globes
ignored
me
drove
toward
the
cleft
fighting
to
get
at
foster
and
i
swept
them
away
as
they
came
the
cloud
around
me
was
smaller
now
the
attack
less
ravenous
i
picked
out
individual
globes
snuffed
them
out
the
hum
became
ragged
faltered
then
there
were
only
a
few
globes
around
me
milling
wildly
disorganized
the
last
half
dozen
fled
bumbling
away
across
the
plain
i
slumped
against
the
rock
sweat
running
down
into
my
eyes
my
lungs
burning
with
the
sulphur
foster
i
gasped
are
you
all
right
he
did
answer
i
flashed
the
light
onto
the
cleft
it
showed
me
damp
clay
a
few
pebbles
foster
was
gone
chapter
vi
i
scrambled
to
the
edge
of
the
pit
and
played
the
light
around
inside
it
shelved
back
at
one
side
and
a
dark
mouth
showed
sloping
down
into
the
earth
the
hiding
place
from
which
the
globes
had
swarmed
foster
was
wedged
in
the
opening
i
scrambled
down
beside
him
tugged
him
back
to
the
level
ground
he
was
still
breathing
that
was
something
i
wondered
if
the
pub
owner
would
come
back
now
that
the
lights
were
gone
or
if
he
tell
someone
what
had
happened
bring
out
a
search
party
somehow
i
doubted
it
he
did
seem
like
the
type
to
ask
for
trouble
with
the
ghosts
of
ancient
sinners
foster
groaned
and
opened
his
eyes
where
are
they
he
muttered
take
it
easy
foster
i
said
you
ok
now
legion
foster
said
he
tried
to
sit
up
the
hunters
ok
call
hunters
if
you
want
to
i
have
got
a
better
name
for
them
i
worked
them
over
with
the
flashlights
they
gone
that
means
let
not
worry
about
what
it
means
let
just
get
out
of
here
the
hunters
they
burst
out
of
the
ground
from
a
cleft
in
the
earth
that
right
you
were
halfway
into
the
hole
i
guess
that
where
they
were
hiding
the
pit
of
the
hunters
foster
said
if
you
say
so
i
said
lucky
you
did
go
down
it
legion
give
me
the
flashlight
i
feel
something
coming
on
that
i
not
going
to
like
i
said
i
handed
him
the
light
and
he
flashed
it
into
the
tunnel
mouth
i
saw
a
polished
roof
of
black
glass
arching
four
feet
over
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
a
stone
dislodged
by
my
movement
clattered
away
down
the
slope
hell
that
tunnel
i
said
peering
into
it
and
i
mean
neolithic
man
legion
we
have
to
see
what
down
there
foster
said
we
could
come
back
later
with
ropes
and
big
insurance
policies
i
said
but
we
wo
said
foster
we
found
what
we
were
looking
for
sure
i
said
and
it
serves
us
right
are
you
sure
you
feel
good
enough
to
make
like
alice
and
the
white
rabbit
i
sure
let
go
foster
thrust
his
legs
into
the
opening
slid
over
the
edge
and
disappeared
i
followed
him
i
eased
down
a
few
feet
glanced
back
for
a
last
look
at
the
night
sky
then
lost
my
grip
and
slid
i
hit
bottom
hard
enough
to
knock
the
wind
out
of
me
i
got
to
my
hands
and
knees
on
a
level
floor
what
is
this
place
i
dug
the
flashlight
out
of
the
rubble
flashed
it
around
we
were
in
a
room
ten
yards
square
i
saw
smooth
walls
the
dark
bulks
of
massive
shapes
that
made
me
think
of
sarcophagi
in
egyptian
burial
vaults
except
that
these
threw
back
highlights
from
dials
and
levers
for
a
couple
of
guys
who
get
shy
in
the
company
of
cops
i
said
we
a
talent
for
doing
the
wrong
thing
this
is
some
kind
of
top
secret
military
installation
impossible
foster
replied
this
could
be
a
modern
structure
at
the
bottom
of
a
shaft
let
get
out
of
here
fast
i
said
we
probably
set
off
an
alarm
already
as
if
in
answer
a
low
chime
cut
across
our
talk
pearly
light
sprang
up
on
a
square
panel
i
got
to
my
feet
moved
over
to
stare
at
it
foster
came
to
my
side
what
do
you
make
of
it
he
said
i
no
expert
on
relics
i
said
but
if
that
not
a
radar
screen
i
eat
it
i
sat
down
in
the
single
chair
before
the
dusty
control
console
and
watched
a
red
blip
creep
across
the
screen
foster
stood
behind
me
we
owe
a
debt
to
that
ancient
sinner
he
said
who
would
have
dreamed
he
lead
us
here
ancient
sinner
i
said
this
place
is
as
modern
as
next
year
juke
box
look
at
the
symbols
on
the
machines
foster
said
they
identical
with
those
in
the
first
section
of
the
journal
all
look
alike
to
me
i
said
it
this
screen
that
got
me
worried
if
i
got
it
doped
out
correctly
that
blip
is
either
a
mighty
slow
airplane
or
it
at
one
hell
of
an
altitude
modern
aircraft
operate
at
great
heights
foster
said
not
at
this
height
i
said
give
me
a
few
more
minutes
to
study
these
scales
there
are
a
number
of
controls
here
foster
said
obviously
intended
to
activate
mechanisms
do
touch
i
said
unless
you
want
to
start
world
war
iii
i
hardly
think
the
results
would
be
so
drastic
foster
replied
surely
this
installation
has
a
simple
purpose
unconnected
with
modern
wars
but
very
possibly
connected
with
the
mystery
of
the
journal
and
of
my
own
past
the
less
we
know
about
this
the
better
i
said
at
least
if
we
do
mess
with
anything
we
can
always
claim
we
just
stepped
in
here
to
get
out
of
the
rain
you
forgetting
the
hunters
said
foster
some
new
gimmick
they
came
out
of
this
shaft
legion
it
was
opened
by
the
pressure
of
the
hunters
bursting
out
why
did
they
pick
that
precise
moment
just
as
we
arrived
i
asked
i
think
they
were
aroused
said
foster
i
think
they
sensed
the
presence
of
their
ancient
foe
i
swung
around
to
look
at
him
i
see
the
way
your
thoughts
are
running
i
said
you
their
ancient
foe
now
huh
just
let
me
get
this
straight
that
means
that
umpteen
hundred
years
ago
you
personally
had
a
fight
with
the
hunters
here
at
stonehenge
you
killed
a
batch
of
them
and
ran
you
hired
some
kind
of
viking
ship
and
crossed
the
atlantic
later
on
you
lost
your
memory
and
started
being
a
guy
named
foster
a
few
weeks
ago
you
lost
it
again
is
that
the
picture
more
or
less
and
now
we
a
couple
of
hundred
feet
under
stonehenge
after
a
brush
with
a
crowd
of
luminous
stinkbombs
and
you
telling
me
you
be
nine
hundred
on
your
next
birthday
remember
the
entry
in
the
journal
legion
came
to
the
place
of
the
hunters
and
it
was
a
place
i
knew
of
old
and
there
was
no
hive
but
a
pit
built
by
men
of
the
two
worlds
okay
i
said
so
you
pushing
a
thousand
i
glanced
at
the
screen
got
out
a
scrap
of
paper
and
scribbled
a
rapid
calculation
here
another
big
number
for
you
that
object
on
the
screen
is
at
an
altitude
give
or
take
a
few
percent
of
thirty
thousand
miles
i
tossed
the
pencil
aside
swung
around
to
frown
at
foster
what
are
we
mixed
up
in
foster
not
that
i
really
want
to
know
i
ready
to
go
to
a
nice
clean
jail
now
and
pay
my
debt
to
society
calm
down
legion
foster
said
you
raving
ok
i
said
turning
back
to
the
screen
you
the
boss
do
what
you
like
it
just
my
reflexes
wanting
to
run
i
got
no
place
to
run
to
at
least
with
you
i
always
got
the
wild
hope
that
maybe
not
completely
nuts
and
that
somehow
i
sat
upright
eyes
on
the
screen
look
at
this
foster
i
snapped
a
pattern
of
dots
flashed
across
the
screen
faded
flashed
again
some
kind
of
iff
i
said
a
recognition
signal
i
wonder
what
supposed
to
do
now
foster
watched
the
screen
saying
nothing
i
do
like
that
thing
blinking
at
us
i
said
it
makes
me
feel
conspicuous
i
looked
at
the
big
red
button
beside
the
screen
maybe
if
i
pushed
that
without
waiting
to
think
it
over
i
jabbed
at
it
a
yellow
light
blinked
on
the
control
panel
on
the
screen
the
pattern
of
dots
vanished
the
red
blip
separated
a
smaller
blip
moving
off
at
right
angles
to
the
main
mass
i
not
sure
you
should
have
done
that
foster
said
there
room
for
doubt
i
said
in
a
strained
voice
it
looks
like
i
launched
a
bomb
from
the
ship
overhead
the
climb
back
up
the
tunnel
took
three
hours
and
every
foot
of
the
way
i
was
listening
to
a
refrain
in
my
head
this
may
be
it
this
may
be
it
this
may
be
i
crawled
out
of
the
tunnel
mouth
and
lay
on
my
back
breathing
hard
foster
groped
his
way
out
beside
me
we
have
to
get
to
the
highway
i
said
untying
the
rope
of
ripped
garments
that
had
linked
us
during
the
climb
there
a
telephone
at
the
pub
we
notify
the
authorities
i
glanced
up
hold
it
i
grabbed
foster
arm
and
pointed
overhead
what
that
foster
looked
up
a
brilliant
point
of
blue
light
brighter
than
a
star
grew
perceptibly
as
we
watched
maybe
we
wo
get
to
notify
anybody
after
all
i
said
i
think
that
our
bomb
coming
home
to
roost
that
illogical
foster
said
the
installation
would
hardly
be
arranged
merely
to
destroy
itself
in
so
complex
a
manner
let
get
out
of
here
i
yelled
it
approaching
us
very
rapidly
foster
said
the
distance
we
could
run
in
the
next
few
minutes
would
be
trivial
by
comparison
with
the
killing
radius
of
a
modern
bomb
we
be
safer
sheltered
in
the
cleft
than
on
the
open
we
could
slide
down
the
tunnel
i
said
and
be
buried
you
right
i
rather
fry
on
the
surface
we
crouched
watching
the
blue
glare
directly
overhead
growing
larger
brighter
i
could
see
foster
face
by
its
light
now
that
no
bomb
foster
said
it
not
falling
it
coming
down
slowly
like
a
like
a
slowly
falling
bomb
i
said
and
it
coming
right
down
on
top
of
us
goodbye
foster
i
ca
claim
it
been
fun
knowing
you
but
it
been
different
we
feel
the
heat
at
any
second
now
i
hope
it
fast
the
glaring
disc
was
the
size
of
the
full
moon
now
unbearably
bright
it
lit
the
plain
like
a
pale
blue
sun
there
was
no
sound
as
it
dropped
lower
the
disc
foreshortened
and
i
could
see
a
dark
shape
above
it
dimly
lit
by
the
glare
thrown
back
from
the
ground
the
thing
is
the
size
of
a
ferry
boat
i
said
it
going
to
miss
us
foster
said
it
will
come
to
ground
several
hundred
feet
to
the
east
of
us
we
watched
the
slender
shape
float
down
with
dreamlike
slowness
now
five
hundred
feet
above
now
three
hundred
then
hovering
just
above
the
giant
stones
it
coming
down
smack
on
top
of
stonehenge
i
yelled
we
watched
as
the
vessel
settled
into
place
dead
center
on
the
ancient
ring
of
stones
for
a
moment
they
were
vividly
silhouetted
against
the
flood
of
blue
radiance
then
abruptly
the
glare
faded
and
died
foster
i
said
do
you
think
it
barely
possible
a
slit
of
yellow
light
appeared
on
the
side
of
the
hull
then
it
widened
to
a
square
a
ladder
extended
itself
dropping
down
to
touch
the
ground
if
somebody
with
tentacles
starts
down
that
ladder
i
said
in
an
unnaturally
shrill
voice
i
getting
out
of
here
no
one
will
emerge
foster
said
quietly
i
think
we
find
legion
that
this
ship
of
space
is
at
our
disposal
i
not
going
aboard
that
thing
i
said
for
the
fifth
time
i
not
sure
of
much
in
this
world
but
i
sure
of
that
legion
foster
said
this
is
no
twentieth
century
military
vessel
it
obviously
homed
on
the
transmitter
in
the
underground
station
which
appears
to
be
directly
under
the
old
monument
which
is
several
thousand
years
old
and
i
supposed
to
believe
the
ship
has
been
orbiting
the
earth
for
the
last
few
thousand
years
waiting
for
someone
to
push
the
red
button
you
call
that
logical
given
permanent
materials
such
as
those
the
notebook
is
made
of
it
not
impossible
or
even
difficult
we
got
out
of
the
tunnel
alive
let
settle
for
that
we
on
the
verge
of
solving
a
mystery
that
goes
back
through
the
centuries
said
foster
a
mystery
that
i
pursued
if
i
understand
the
journal
through
many
lifetimes
one
thing
about
losing
your
memory
you
do
have
any
fixed
ideas
to
get
in
the
way
of
your
theories
foster
smiled
grimly
the
trail
has
brought
us
here
we
must
follow
it
wherever
it
leads
i
lay
on
the
ground
staring
up
at
the
unbelievable
shape
across
the
field
the
beckoning
square
of
light
this
ship
or
whatever
it
is
i
said
it
drops
down
out
of
nowhere
and
opens
its
doors
and
you
want
to
walk
right
into
the
cosy
interior
listen
foster
cut
in
i
heard
a
low
rumbling
then
a
sound
that
rolled
ominously
like
distant
guns
more
ships
i
started
jet
aircraft
foster
said
from
the
bases
in
east
anglia
probably
of
course
they
have
tracked
our
ship
in
that
all
for
me
i
yelled
getting
to
my
feet
the
secret
out
get
down
legion
foster
shouted
the
engines
were
a
blanketing
roar
now
what
for
they
two
long
lines
of
fire
traced
themselves
across
the
sky
curving
down
i
hit
the
dirt
behind
the
stone
in
the
same
instant
the
rockets
struck
the
shock
wave
slammed
at
the
earth
like
a
monster
thunderclap
and
i
saw
the
tunnel
mouth
collapse
i
twisted
saw
the
red
interior
of
the
jet
tailpipe
as
the
fighter
hurtled
past
rolling
into
a
climbing
turn
they
crazy
i
yelled
firing
on
a
second
barrage
blasted
across
my
indignation
i
hugged
the
muck
and
waited
while
nine
salvoes
shook
the
earth
then
the
rumble
died
reluctantly
the
air
reeked
of
high
explosives
we
have
been
dead
now
if
we
tried
the
tunnel
i
gasped
spitting
dirt
it
caved
at
the
first
rocket
and
if
the
ship
was
what
you
thought
foster
they
destroyed
something
the
sentence
died
unnoticed
the
dust
was
settling
and
through
it
the
shape
of
the
ship
reared
up
unchanged
except
that
the
square
of
light
was
gone
as
i
watched
the
door
opened
again
and
the
ladder
ran
out
once
more
invitingly
they
try
next
time
with
nukes
i
said
that
may
be
too
much
for
the
ship
defenses
and
it
will
sure
be
too
much
for
us
listen
foster
cut
in
a
deeper
rumble
was
building
in
the
distance
to
the
ship
foster
called
he
was
up
and
running
and
i
hesitated
just
long
enough
to
think
about
trying
for
the
highway
and
being
caught
in
the
open
and
then
i
was
running
too
ahead
foster
stumbled
crossing
the
ground
that
had
been
ripped
up
by
the
rocket
bursts
made
it
to
the
ladder
and
went
up
it
fast
the
growl
of
the
approaching
bombers
grew
a
snarl
of
deadly
hatred
i
leaped
a
stone
fragment
took
the
ladder
in
two
jumps
plunged
into
the
interior
behind
me
the
door
smacked
shut
i
was
standing
in
a
luxuriously
fitted
circular
room
there
was
a
pedestal
in
the
center
of
the
floor
from
which
a
polished
bar
projected
the
bones
of
a
man
lay
beside
it
while
i
stared
foster
sprang
forward
seized
the
bar
and
pulled
it
slid
back
easily
the
lights
flickered
and
i
had
a
moment
of
vertigo
nothing
else
happened
try
it
the
other
way
i
yelled
the
bombs
will
fall
any
second
i
went
for
it
hand
outstretched
foster
thrust
in
front
of
me
look
i
stared
at
the
glowing
panel
he
was
pointing
to
a
duplicate
of
the
one
in
the
underground
chamber
it
showed
a
curved
white
line
with
a
red
point
ascending
from
it
we
clear
foster
said
we
made
a
successful
but
we
ca
be
moving
there
no
acceleration
there
must
be
soundproofing
that
why
we
ca
hear
the
bombers
no
soundproofing
would
help
if
we
were
at
ground
zero
foster
said
this
ship
is
the
product
of
an
advanced
science
we
left
the
bombers
far
behind
where
are
we
going
who
steering
this
thing
it
steers
itself
i
would
judge
foster
said
i
do
know
where
we
going
but
we
well
on
the
way
i
looked
at
him
in
amazement
you
like
this
do
you
foster
having
the
time
of
your
life
i
ca
deny
that
i
delighted
at
this
turn
of
events
foster
said
do
you
see
this
vessel
is
a
launch
or
lifeboat
under
automatic
control
and
it
taking
us
to
the
mother
ship
okay
foster
i
said
i
looked
at
the
skeleton
on
the
floor
behind
him
but
i
hope
we
have
better
luck
than
the
last
passenger
chapter
vii
it
was
two
hours
later
and
foster
and
i
stood
silent
before
a
screen
that
had
glowed
into
life
when
i
touched
a
silver
button
beside
it
it
showed
us
a
vast
emptiness
of
bottomless
black
set
thick
with
corruscating
points
of
polychrome
brilliance
that
hurt
to
look
at
and
against
that
backdrop
a
ship
vast
beyond
imagining
blotting
out
half
the
titanic
vista
with
its
bulk
but
dead
even
from
the
distance
of
miles
i
could
sense
it
the
great
black
torpedo
shape
dull
moonlight
glinting
along
the
unbelievable
length
of
its
sleek
flank
drifted
a
derelict
i
wondered
for
how
many
centuries
it
had
waited
here
and
for
what
i
feel
said
foster
somehow
i
coming
home
i
tried
to
say
something
croaked
cleared
my
throat
if
this
is
your
jitney
i
said
i
hope
they
did
leave
the
meter
ticking
on
you
we
broke
we
closing
rapidly
said
foster
another
ten
minutes
guess
how
do
we
go
about
heaving
to
alongside
you
did
come
across
a
book
of
instructions
did
you
i
think
i
can
predict
that
the
approach
will
be
automatic
this
is
your
big
moment
is
it
i
said
i
got
to
hand
it
to
you
pal
you
won
out
by
pluck
just
like
the
rover
boys
the
ship
appeared
to
move
smoothly
closer
looming
over
us
fine
golden
lines
of
decorative
filigree
work
visible
now
against
the
black
a
tiny
square
of
pale
light
appeared
grew
into
a
huge
bay
door
that
swallowed
us
the
screen
went
dark
there
was
a
gentle
jar
then
motionlessness
the
port
opened
silently
we
arrived
foster
said
shall
we
step
out
and
have
a
look
i
would
think
of
going
back
without
one
i
said
i
followed
him
out
and
stopped
dead
gaping
i
had
expected
an
empty
hold
bare
metal
walls
instead
i
found
a
vaulted
cavern
shadowed
mysterious
rich
with
a
thousand
colors
there
was
a
hint
of
strange
perfume
in
the
air
and
i
heard
low
music
that
muttered
among
buttresses
there
were
pools
playing
fountains
waterfalls
dim
vistas
stretching
away
lit
by
slanting
rays
of
muted
sunlight
what
kind
of
place
is
it
i
asked
it
like
a
fairyland
or
a
dream
it
not
an
earthly
scheme
of
decoration
foster
said
but
i
find
it
strangely
pleasing
hey
look
over
there
i
yelped
suddenly
pointing
an
skull
stared
past
me
from
the
shadows
at
the
base
of
a
column
foster
went
over
to
the
skull
stood
looking
down
at
it
there
was
a
disaster
here
he
said
that
much
is
plain
it
creepy
i
said
let
go
back
i
forgot
to
get
film
for
my
brownie
the
pose
no
threat
said
foster
he
was
kneeling
looking
at
the
white
bones
he
picked
up
something
stared
at
it
look
legion
i
went
over
foster
held
up
a
ring
we
onto
something
hot
pal
i
said
it
the
twin
to
yours
i
wonder
who
he
was
i
shook
my
head
if
we
knew
that
and
who
killed
him
or
what
let
go
on
the
answers
must
be
here
somewhere
foster
moved
off
toward
a
corridor
that
reminded
me
of
a
sunny
avenue
lined
with
chestnut
trees
though
there
were
no
trees
and
no
sun
i
followed
gaping
for
hours
we
wandered
looking
touching
not
saying
much
but
saturated
in
wonder
like
kids
in
a
toy
factory
we
came
across
another
skeleton
lying
among
towering
engines
finally
we
paused
in
a
giant
storeroom
stacked
high
with
supplies
have
you
stopped
to
think
foster
i
said
fingering
a
length
of
cloth
as
thin
as
woven
spider
webs
this
boat
a
of
salable
items
talk
about
the
wealth
of
the
indies
i
seek
only
one
thing
here
my
friend
foster
said
my
past
sure
i
said
but
just
in
case
you
do
find
it
you
might
consider
the
business
angle
we
can
set
up
a
regular
shuttle
run
hauling
stuff
down
you
earthmen
sighed
foster
for
you
every
new
experience
is
immediately
assessed
in
terms
of
its
merchandising
possibilities
well
i
leave
that
to
you
okay
okay
i
said
you
go
on
ahead
and
scout
around
down
that
way
if
you
want
where
the
stuff
is
i
want
to
browse
around
here
for
a
while
as
you
wish
we
meet
at
this
end
of
the
big
hall
we
passed
back
there
okay
foster
nodded
and
went
on
i
turned
to
a
bin
filled
with
what
looked
like
unset
emeralds
the
size
of
walnuts
i
picked
up
a
handful
juggled
them
lovingly
anyone
for
marbles
i
murmured
to
myself
hours
later
i
came
along
a
corridor
that
was
like
a
path
through
a
garden
that
was
a
forest
crossed
a
ballroom
like
a
meadow
floored
in
wood
and
shaded
by
giant
ferns
and
went
under
an
arch
into
the
hall
where
foster
sat
at
a
long
table
cut
from
yellow
marble
a
light
the
color
of
sunrise
gleamed
through
tall
i
dumped
an
armfull
of
books
on
the
table
look
at
these
i
said
all
made
from
the
same
stuff
as
the
journal
and
the
pictures
i
flipped
open
one
of
the
books
a
heavy
volume
to
a
spread
in
color
showing
a
group
of
bearded
arabs
in
dingy
white
djellabas
staring
toward
the
camera
a
flock
of
thin
goats
in
the
background
it
looked
like
the
kind
of
picture
the
national
geographic
runs
except
that
the
quality
of
the
color
and
detail
was
equal
to
the
best
color
transparencies
i
ca
read
the
print
i
said
but
i
a
whiz
at
looking
at
pictures
most
of
the
books
showed
scenes
like
i
hope
i
never
see
in
the
flesh
but
i
found
a
few
that
were
made
on
earth
god
knows
how
long
ago
travel
books
perhaps
foster
said
travel
books
that
you
could
sell
to
any
university
on
earth
for
their
next
year
budget
i
said
shuffling
pages
take
a
look
at
this
one
foster
looked
across
at
the
panoramic
shot
of
a
procession
of
men
in
white
sarongs
carrying
a
miniature
golden
boat
on
their
shoulders
descending
a
long
flight
of
white
stone
steps
leading
from
a
colonnade
of
heroic
human
figures
with
folded
arms
and
painted
faces
in
the
background
cliffs
loomed
up
baked
in
desert
heat
that
the
temple
of
in
its
prime
i
said
which
makes
this
print
close
to
four
thousand
years
old
here
another
i
recognize
i
turned
to
a
smaller
aerial
view
showing
a
gigantic
pyramid
its
polished
stone
facing
chipped
in
places
and
with
a
few
panels
missing
from
the
lower
levels
revealing
the
cruder
structure
of
massive
blocks
beneath
that
one
of
the
major
pyramids
maybe
khufu
i
said
it
was
already
a
couple
thousand
years
old
and
falling
into
disrepair
and
look
at
this
i
opened
another
volume
showed
foster
a
vivid
photograph
of
a
great
shaggy
elephant
with
a
pinkish
trunk
upraised
between
yellow
tusks
a
mastodon
i
said
and
there
a
woolly
rhino
and
an
critter
that
must
be
a
this
book
is
a
lifetime
of
rummaging
would
exhaust
the
treasures
aboard
this
ship
said
foster
how
about
bones
did
you
find
any
more
foster
nodded
there
was
a
disaster
of
some
sort
perhaps
disease
none
of
the
bones
was
broken
i
ca
figure
the
one
in
the
lifeboat
i
said
why
was
he
wearing
a
necklace
of
bear
teeth
i
sat
down
across
from
foster
we
got
plenty
of
mysteries
to
solve
all
right
but
there
are
some
other
items
we
better
talk
about
for
instance
where
the
kitchen
i
getting
hungry
foster
handed
me
a
black
rod
from
among
several
that
lay
on
the
table
i
think
this
may
be
important
he
said
what
is
it
a
chop
stick
touch
it
to
your
head
above
the
ear
what
does
it
do
give
you
a
massage
i
pressed
it
to
my
temple
was
in
a
room
facing
a
towering
surface
of
ribbed
metal
i
reached
out
placed
my
hands
over
the
proper
perforations
the
housings
opened
for
apparent
malfunction
in
the
quaternary
field
amplifiers
i
knew
circuit
override
was
necessary
before
i
blinked
looked
around
at
the
yellow
table
and
piled
books
the
rod
in
my
hand
i
was
in
some
kind
of
powerhouse
i
said
there
was
something
wrong
with
with
the
quaternary
field
amplifiers
foster
said
i
seemed
to
be
right
there
i
said
i
understood
exactly
what
it
was
all
about
these
are
technical
manuals
foster
said
they
tell
us
everything
we
need
to
know
about
the
ship
i
was
thinking
about
what
i
was
getting
ready
to
do
i
said
the
way
you
do
when
you
starting
into
a
job
i
was
the
quaternary
whatzits
and
i
knew
how
foster
got
to
his
feet
and
moved
toward
the
doorway
we
have
to
start
at
one
end
of
the
library
and
work
our
way
through
he
said
it
will
take
us
a
while
but
we
get
the
facts
we
need
then
we
can
plan
foster
picked
a
handful
of
briefing
rods
from
the
racks
in
the
comfortably
furnished
library
and
started
in
the
first
thing
we
needed
was
a
clue
as
to
where
to
look
for
food
and
beds
or
for
operating
instructions
for
the
ship
itself
i
hoped
we
might
find
the
equivalent
of
a
library
then
we
could
put
our
hands
on
what
we
wanted
in
a
hurry
i
went
to
the
far
end
of
the
first
rack
and
spotted
a
short
row
of
red
rods
that
stood
out
vividly
among
the
black
ones
i
took
one
out
thought
it
over
decided
it
was
unlikely
that
it
was
any
more
dangerous
than
the
others
and
put
it
against
my
temple
the
bells
rang
i
applied
tension
suppressed
cortical
areas
and
iota
and
stood
by
i
jerked
the
rod
from
my
head
my
ears
still
ringing
with
the
shrill
alarm
the
effect
of
the
rods
was
like
reality
itself
but
intensified
all
attention
focused
on
the
experience
at
hand
i
thought
of
the
entertainment
potentialities
of
the
idea
you
could
kill
a
tiger
ride
an
airplane
down
in
flames
face
the
heavyweight
champion
i
wondered
about
the
stronger
sensations
like
pain
and
fear
would
they
seem
as
real
as
the
impulse
to
check
the
whatchamacallits
or
tighten
up
your
cortical
thingamajigs
i
tried
another
rod
the
sound
of
the
i
racked
instruments
walked
not
ran
to
the
nearest
another
assumed
duty
as
alert
officer
i
reported
first
to
coordination
control
via
and
confirmed
these
were
routine
sop
covering
simple
situations
aboard
ship
i
skipped
a
few
tried
again
a
xivometer
i
keyed
one
followed
with
the
three
rods
further
along
i
got
this
situation
falling
outside
my
area
of
primary
conditioning
i
reported
in
corpo
to
technical
briefing

section
four
twelve
preliminary
i
recalled
that
it
was
now
necessary
to
supply
my
activity
code
my

my
activity
code
a
sensation
of
disorientation
grew
confused
images
flickered
like
vague
then
a
clear
voice
cut
across
the
confusion
you
have
suffered
partial
do
not
be
alarmed
select
a
general

rod
from
the
nearest
emergency
rack
its
location
is
was
moving
along
the
stacks
to
pause
in
front
of
a
niche
where
a
plastic
strip
was
clamped
to
the
wall
i
removed
it
fitted
it
to
my
head

i
was
moving
along
the

that
last
bit
had
been
potent
something
about
a
general
background
briefing
hey
foster
i
called
i
think
i
got
something
he
appeared
from
the
stacks
as
i
see
it
i
said
this
background
briefing
should
tell
us
all
we
need
to
know
about
the
ship
then
we
can
plan
our
next
move
more
intelligently
we
know
what
we
doing
i
took
the
thing
from
the
wall
just
as
i
had
seemed
to
do
in
the
phantom
scene
the
red
rod
had
projected
for
me
these
things
make
me
dizzy
i
said
handing
it
to
foster
anyway
you
the
logical
one
to
try
it
he
took
the
plastic
shape
went
to
the
reclining
seat
at
the
near
end
of
the
library
hall
and
settled
himself
i
have
an
idea
this
one
will
hit
harder
than
the
others
he
said
he
fitted
the
clamp
to
his
head
and
instantly
his
eyes
glazed
he
slumped
back
limp
foster
i
yelled
i
jumped
forward
started
to
pull
the
plastic
piece
from
his
head
then
hesitated
maybe
foster
abrupt
reaction
was
standard
procedure
but
i
did
like
it
much
i
went
on
reasoning
with
myself
after
all
this
was
what
the
red
rod
had
indicated
as
normal
procedure
in
a
given
emergency
foster
was
merely
having
his
faded
personality
touched
up
and
his
personality
was
what
we
needed
to
give
us
the
answers
to
a
lot
of
the
questions
we
been
asking
though
the
ship
and
everything
in
it
had
lain
unused
and
silent
for
forgotten
millenia
still
the
library
should
be
good
the
librarian
was
gone
from
his
post
for
forgotten
centuries
and
foster
was
lying
unconscious
and
i
was
thirty
thousand
miles
from
home
but
i
should
let
trifles
like
that
worry
me
i
got
up
and
prowled
the
room
there
was
much
to
look
at
except
stacks
and
more
stacks
the
knowledge
stored
here
was
fantastic
both
in
magnitude
and
character
if
i
ever
get
home
with
a
load
of
these
rods
i
strolled
through
a
door
leading
to
another
room
it
was
small
functional
dimly
lit
the
middle
of
the
room
was
occupied
by
a
large
and
elaborate
divan
with
a
fitting
at
one
end
other
curious
accoutrements
were
ranked
along
the
walls
there
was
much
in
them
to
thrill
me
but
i
had
hit
the
jackpot
two
skeletons
lay
near
the
door
in
the
final
slump
of
death
another
lay
beside
the
fancy
couch
there
was
a
dagger
beside
it
i
squatted
beside
the
two
near
the
door
and
examined
them
closely
as
far
as
i
could
tell
they
were
as
human
as
i
was
i
wondered
what
kind
of
men
they
had
been
what
kind
of
world
they
had
come
from
that
could
build
a
ship
like
this
and
stock
it
as
it
was
stocked
the
dagger
that
lay
near
the
other
bones
was
interesting
it
seemed
to
be
made
of
a
transparent
orange
metal
and
its
hilt
was
stamped
in
a
repeated
pattern
of
the
two
worlds
motif
it
was
the
first
clue
as
to
what
had
taken
place
among
these
men
when
they
last
lived
not
a
complete
clue
but
a
start
i
took
a
closer
look
at
an
apparatus
like
a
dentist
chair
parked
against
the
wall
there
were
metal
arms
mounted
above
it
and
a
series
of
colored
glass
lenses
a
row
of
dull
silver
cylinders
was
racked
against
the
wall
another
projected
from
a
socket
at
the
side
of
the
machine
i
took
it
out
and
looked
at
it
it
was
a
plain
plastic
heavy
and
smooth
i
felt
pretty
sure
it
was
a
close
cousin
to
the
chopsticks
stored
in
the
library
i
wondered
what
brand
of
information
was
recorded
in
it
as
i
dropped
it
in
my
pocket
i
lit
a
cigarette
and
went
out
to
where
foster
lay
he
was
still
in
the
same
position
as
when
i
had
left
him
i
sat
down
on
the
floor
beside
the
couch
to
wait
it
was
an
hour
before
he
stirred
heaved
a
sigh
and
opened
his
eyes
he
reached
up
pulled
off
the
plastic
headpiece
dropped
it
on
the
floor
are
you
okay
i
said
brother
i
been
sweating
foster
looked
at
me
his
eyes
traveling
up
to
my
uncombed
hair
and
down
to
my
scuffed
shoes
his
eyes
narrowed
in
a
faint
frown
then
he
said
something
in
a
language
that
seemed
to
be
all
z
and
q
do
spring
any
surprises
on
me
foster
i
said
hoarsely
talk
american
a
look
of
surprise
crossed
his
face
he
stared
into
my
eyes
again
then
glanced
around
the
room
this
is
a
ship
library
he
said
i
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
you
gave
me
a
scare
foster
i
thought
for
a
second
your
memory
was
wandering
again
foster
was
watching
my
face
as
i
spoke
what
was
it
all
about
i
said
what
have
you
found
out
i
know
you
said
foster
slowly
your
name
is
legion
i
nodded
i
could
feel
myself
getting
tense
again
sure
you
know
me
just
take
it
easy
pal
this
is
no
time
to
lose
your
marbles
i
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
you
remember
we
were
he
shook
my
hand
off
that
is
not
the
custom
in
vallon
he
said
coldly
vallon
i
echoed
what
kind
of
routine
is
this
foster
we
were
friends
when
we
walked
into
this
room
an
hour
ago
we
were
hot
on
the
trail
of
something
and
i
human
enough
to
want
to
know
how
it
turned
out
where
are
the
others
there
a
couple
of
in
the
next
room
i
snapped
but
they
lost
a
lot
of
weight
i
can
find
you
several
more
in
the
same
condition
outside
of
them
there
only
me
foster
looked
at
me
as
if
i
was
there
i
remember
vallon
he
said
he
put
a
hand
to
his
head
but
i
remember
too
a
barbaric
world
brutal
and
primitive
you
were
there
we
traveled
in
a
crude
and
then
in
a
barge
that
wallowed
in
the
sea
there
were
narrow
ugly
rooms
evil
odors
harsh
noises
that
not
a
very
flattering
portrait
of
god
country
i
said
but
i
afraid
i
recognize
it
the
people
were
the
worst
foster
said
misshapen
diseased
with
swollen
abdomens
and
wasted
skin
and
withered
limbs
some
of
the
boys
do
get
out
enough
i
said
the
hunters
we
fled
from
them
legion
you
and
i
and
i
remember
a
he
paused
strange
it
had
lost
its
and
fallen
into
ruin
us
natives
call
it
stonehenge
the
hunters
burst
out
of
the
earth
we
fought
them
but
why
should
the
hunters
seek
me
i
was
hoping
you
tell
me
i
said
do
you
know
where
this
ship
came
from
and
why
this
is
a
ship
of
the
two
worlds
he
replied
but
i
know
nothing
of
how
it
came
to
be
here
how
about
all
that
stuff
in
the
journal
maybe
now
you
the
journal
foster
broke
in
where
is
it
in
your
coat
pocket
i
guess
foster
felt
through
his
jacket
awkwardly
brought
out
the
journal
he
opened
it
i
moved
around
to
look
over
his
shoulder
he
had
the
book
open
to
the
first
section
the
part
written
in
the
curious
alien
characters
that
nobody
had
been
able
to
decipher
and
he
was
reading
it
we
sat
at
the
library
table
of
deep
green
heavy
polished
wood
the
journal
open
at
its
center
for
hours
i
had
waited
while
foster
read
now
at
last
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
ran
a
hand
through
the
youthful
black
hair
and
sighed
my
name
he
said
was
qulqlan
and
this
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
book
is
my
story
this
is
one
part
of
the
past
i
was
seeking
and
i
remember
none
of
it
tell
me
what
the
journal
says
i
asked
read
it
to
me
foster
picked
it
up
riffled
the
pages
it
seems
that
i
awoke
once
before
in
a
small
room
aboard
this
vessel
i
was
lying
on
a
by
which
circumstance
i
knew
that
i
had
suffered
a
change
you
mean
you
lost
your
memory
and
regained
it
on
the
couch
my
had
been
on
my
mind
i
awoke
knowing
my
identity
but
not
how
i
came
to
be
aboard
this
vessel
the
journal
says
that
my
last
memory
was
of
a
building
beside
the
shallow
sea
where
that
on
a
far
world
called
vallon
yeah
and
what
next
i
looked
around
me
and
saw
four
men
lying
on
the
floor
slashed
and
bloody
one
was
alive
i
gave
him
what
emergency
treatment
i
could
then
searched
the
ship
i
found
three
more
men
dead
none
living
then
the
hunters
attacked
swarming
to
me
our
friends
the
yes
they
would
have
sucked
the
life
from
me
and
i
had
no
shield
of
light
i
fled
to
the
lifeboat
carrying
the
wounded
man
i
descended
to
the
planet
below
your
earth
the
man
died
there
he
had
been
my
friend
a
man
named
ammaerln
i
buried
him
in
a
shallow
depression
in
the
earth
and
marked
the
place
with
a
stone
the
ancient
sinner
i
said
yes
i
suppose
it
was
his
bones
the
lay
brother
found
and
we
found
out
last
night
that
the
depression
was
the
result
of
dirt
sifting
into
the
ventilator
shaft
but
i
guess
you
did
know
anything
about
the
underground
installation
way
back
then
does
the
journal
say
anything
no
there
is
no
mention
made
of
it
here
foster
shook
his
head
how
curious
to
read
of
the
affairs
of
this
stranger
and
know
he
is
myself
how
about
the
hunters
how
did
they
get
to
earth
they
are
insubstantial
creatures
said
foster
yet
they
can
endure
the
vacuum
of
space
i
can
only
surmise
that
they
followed
the
lifeboat
down
they
were
tailing
you
yes
but
i
have
no
idea
why
they
pursued
me
they
harmless
creatures
in
the
natural
state
used
to
seek
out
the
rare
fugitive
from
justice
on
vallon
they
can
be
attuned
to
the
individual
thereafter
they
follow
him
and
mark
him
out
for
capture
kind
of
like
bloodhounds
i
said
say
what
were
you
a
racketeer
on
vallon
the
journal
is
frustratingly
silent
as
to
my
vallonian
career
said
foster
but
this
whole
matter
of
the
unexplained
voyage
and
the
evidences
of
violence
aboard
the
ship
make
me
wonder
whether
i
and
perhaps
others
of
my
companions
were
being
exiled
for
crimes
done
in
the
two
worlds
wow
so
they
sicced
the
hunters
on
you
i
said
but
why
did
they
hang
around
at
stonehenge
all
this
time
there
was
a
trickle
of
power
feeding
the
screens
said
foster
they
need
a
source
of
electrical
energy
to
live
until
a
hundred
years
ago
it
was
the
only
one
on
the
planet
how
did
they
get
down
into
the
shaft
without
opening
it
up
given
time
they
pass
easily
through
porous
substances
but
of
course
last
night
when
i
came
on
them
after
their
long
fast
they
simply
burst
through
in
their
haste
okay
what
happened
next
after
you
buried
the
man
the
journal
tells
that
i
was
set
upon
by
natives
men
who
wore
the
hides
of
animals
one
of
their
number
entered
the
ship
he
must
have
moved
the
drive
lever
it
lifted
leaving
me
marooned
so
those
were
his
bones
we
found
in
the
boat
i
mused
the
ones
with
the
necklace
i
wonder
why
he
did
come
into
the
ship
undoubtedly
he
did
but
remember
the
skeleton
we
found
just
inside
the
landing
port
that
must
have
been
a
fairly
fresh
and
rather
gory
corpse
at
the
time
the
savage
stepped
aboard
it
probably
seemed
to
him
all
too
clear
an
indication
of
what
lay
in
store
for
himself
if
he
ventured
further
in
his
terror
he
must
have
retreated
to
the
boat
to
wait
and
there
starved
to
death
he
was
stranded
in
your
world
and
you
were
stranded
in
his
yes
said
foster
and
then
it
seems
i
lived
among
the
and
came
to
be
their
king
i
waited
there
by
the
landing
ring
through
many
years
in
the
hope
of
rescue
because
i
did
not
age
as
the
natives
did
i
was
worshipped
as
a
god
i
would
have
built
a
signalling
device
but
there
were
no
pure
metals
nothing
i
could
use
i
tried
to
teach
them
but
it
was
a
work
of
centuries
i
should
think
you
could
have
set
up
a
school
trained
the
smartest
ones
i
said
there
was
no
lack
of
intelligent
minds
foster
said
it
is
plain
that
the
savages
were
of
the
blood
of
the
two
worlds
this
earth
must
have
been
seeded
long
ago
by
some
ancient
castaways
but
how
could
you
go
on
living
for
hundreds
of
years
are
your
people
supermen
that
live
forever
the
natural
span
of
a
human
life
is
very
great
among
your
people
there
is
a
wasting
disease
from
which
you
all
die
young
that
no
disease
i
said
you
just
naturally
get
old
and
die
the
human
mind
is
a
magnificent
instrument
foster
said
not
meant
to
wither
quickly
i
have
to
chew
that
one
over
i
said
why
did
you
catch
this
disease
all
vallonians
are
innoculated
against
it
i
like
a
shot
of
that
i
said
but
let
get
back
to
you
foster
turned
the
pages
of
the
journal
i
ruled
many
peoples
under
many
names
he
said
i
traveled
in
many
lands
seeking
for
skilled
wise
men
but
always
i
returned
to
the
it
must
have
been
tough
i
said
exiled
on
a
strange
world
living
out
your
life
in
a
wilderness
century
after
century
my
life
was
not
without
interest
foster
said
i
watched
my
savage
people
put
aside
their
animal
hides
and
learn
the
ways
of
civilization
i
taught
them
how
to
build
and
keep
herds
and
till
the
land
i
built
a
great
city
and
i
tried
foolishly
to
teach
their
noble
caste
the
code
of
chivalry
of
the
two
worlds
but
although
they
sat
at
a
round
table
like
the
great
at
they
never
really
understood
and
then
they
grew
too
wise
and
wondered
at
their
king
who
never
aged
i
left
them
and
tried
again
to
build
a
the
hunters
sensed
it
and
swarmed
to
me
i
drove
them
off
with
fires
and
then
i
grew
curious
and
followed
them
back
to
their
nest
i
know
i
and
it
was
a
place
you
knew
of
old
no
hive
but
a
pit
built
by
men
they
overwhelmed
me
i
barely
escaped
with
my
life
starvation
had
made
the
hunters
vicious
they
would
have
drained
my
body
of
its
and
if
you
known
the
transmitter
was
there
but
you
did
so
you
put
an
ocean
between
you
and
them
they
found
me
even
there
each
time
i
destroyed
many
of
them
and
fled
but
always
a
few
lived
to
breed
and
seek
me
out
again
but
your
signaller
did
it
work
no
it
was
a
hopeless
attempt
only
a
highly
developed
technology
could
supply
the
raw
materials
i
could
only
teach
what
i
knew
encourage
the
development
of
the
sciences
and
wait
and
then
i
began
to
forget
why
a
mind
grows
weary
foster
said
it
is
the
price
of
longevity
it
must
renew
itself
shock
and
privation
hasten
the
change
i
had
held
it
off
for
many
centuries
now
i
felt
it
coming
on
me
at
home
on
vallon
a
man
would
record
his
memory
at
such
a
time
store
it
electronically
in
a
recording
device
and
after
the
change
use
the
to
restore
in
his
renewed
body
his
old
recollections
in
toto
but
marooned
as
i
was
my
memories
once
lost
were
gone
forever
i
did
what
i
could
i
prepared
a
safe
place
and
wrote
messages
that
i
would
find
when
i
awoke
when
you
woke
up
in
the
hotel
you
were
young
again
overnight
how
could
it
happen
when
the
mind
renews
itself
erasing
the
scars
of
the
years
the
body
too
regenerates
the
skin
forgets
its
wrinkles
and
the
muscles
their
fatigue
they
become
again
as
they
once
were
when
i
first
met
you
i
said
you
told
me
about
waking
up
back
in
with
no
memory
yours
is
a
harsh
world
legion
i
must
have
forgotten
many
times
somewhere
some
time
i
lost
the
vital
link
forgot
my
quest
when
the
hunters
came
again
i
fled
not
understanding
you
had
a
machine
gun
set
up
in
the
house
at
mayport
what
good
was
that
against
the
hunters
none
i
suppose
foster
replied
but
i
did
know
i
only
knew
that
i
was
pursued
and
by
then
you
could
have
made
a
signaller
i
said
but
forgotten
how
or
even
that
you
needed
one
but
in
the
end
i
found
it
with
your
help
legion
but
still
there
is
a
mystery
what
came
to
pass
aboard
this
ship
all
those
centuries
ago
why
was
i
here
and
what
killed
the
others
look
i
said
here
a
theory
there
was
a
mutiny
while
you
were
in
the
machine
having
your
memory
fixed
you
woke
up
and
it
was
all
over
and
the
crew
was
dead
that
hypothesis
will
serve
said
foster
but
one
day
i
must
learn
the
truth
of
this
matter
what
i
ca
figure
out
is
why
somebody
from
vallon
did
come
after
this
ship
it
was
right
here
in
orbit
consider
the
immensity
of
space
legion
this
is
one
tiny
world
among
the
stars
but
there
was
a
station
here
fitted
out
for
handling
your
ships
that
sounds
like
it
was
a
regular
port
of
call
and
the
books
with
the
pictures
they
prove
your
people
have
been
here
off
and
on
for
thousands
of
years
why
would
they
stop
coming
there
are
such
beacons
on
a
thousand
worlds
said
foster
think
of
it
as
a
buoy
marking
a
reef
a
trailblaze
in
the
wilderness
ages
could
pass
before
a
wanderer
chanced
this
way
again
the
fact
that
the
ventilator
shaft
at
stonehenge
was
choked
with
the
debris
of
centuries
when
i
first
landed
there
shows
how
seldom
this
world
was
visited
i
thought
about
it
bit
by
bit
foster
was
putting
together
the
pieces
of
his
past
but
he
still
had
a
long
way
to
go
before
he
had
the
big
picture
frame
and
all
i
had
an
idea
say
you
said
you
were
in
the
memory
machine
you
woke
up
there
and
you
just
had
your
memory
restored
why
not
do
the
same
thing
again
now
that
is
if
your
brain
can
take
another
pounding
this
soon
yes
he
said
he
stood
up
abruptly
there
just
a
chance
come
i
followed
him
out
of
the
library
into
the
room
with
the
bones
he
moved
over
to
look
down
at
them
curiously
quite
a
fracas
i
said
three
of
this
would
be
the
room
where
i
awakened
said
foster
these
are
the
men
i
saw
dead
they
still
dead
i
said
but
what
about
the
machine
foster
walked
across
to
the
fancy
couch
leaned
down
beside
it
then
shook
his
head
no
he
said
of
course
it
would
be
here
what
my
the
one
that
was
used
to
restore
my
memory
that
other
time
suddenly
i
recalled
the
cylinder
i
had
pocketed
hours
before
with
a
surprising
flutter
at
my
heart
i
held
it
up
like
a
kid
in
a
classroom
who
knows
he
got
the
right
answer
this
it
foster
glanced
at
it
briefly
no
that
an
empty
like
those
you
see
filed
over
there
he
pointed
to
the
rack
of
cylinders
on
the
opposite
wall
they
would
be
used
for
emergency
recordings
regular
would
be
with
a
pattern
of
colored
lines
it
figures
i
said
that
would
have
been
too
easy
we
have
to
do
everything
the
hard
way
i
looked
around
it
a
big
bureau
to
look
for
a
collar
button
under
but
i
guess
we
can
try
it
does
matter
really
when
i
return
to
vallon
i
recover
my
past
there
are
vaults
where
every
citizen
trace
is
stored
but
you
had
yours
here
with
you
it
could
only
have
been
a
copy
the
master
trace
is
never
removed
from
i
guess
you
be
eager
to
get
back
there
i
said
that
be
quite
a
moment
for
you
getting
back
home
after
all
these
years
speaking
of
years
were
you
able
to
figure
out
how
long
you
were
marooned
down
on
earth
i
lost
all
record
of
dates
long
ago
said
foster
i
can
only
estimate
the
time
about
how
long
i
persisted
since
i
descended
from
this
ship
legion
he
said
three
thousand
years
have
passed
i
hate
to
see
the
team
split
up
i
said
you
know
i
was
kind
of
getting
used
to
being
an
apprentice
nut
i
going
to
miss
you
foster
come
with
me
to
vallon
legion
he
said
we
were
standing
in
the
observation
lounge
looking
out
at
the
surface
of
the
earth
thirty
thousand
miles
away
beyond
it
the
disk
of
the
moon
hung
like
a
cardboard
cutout
thanks
anyway
buddy
i
said
i
like
to
see
those
other
worlds
of
yours
but
in
the
end
i
might
regret
it
it
no
good
giving
an
eskimo
a
television
set
i
just
sit
around
on
vallon
pining
for
home
people
stinks
and
all
you
could
return
here
some
day
from
what
i
understand
about
traveling
in
a
ship
like
this
i
said
a
couple
of
hundred
years
would
pass
before
i
got
back
even
if
it
only
seemed
like
a
few
weeks
en
route
i
want
to
live
out
my
life
here
with
the
kind
of
people
i
know
in
the
world
i
grew
up
in
it
has
its
faults
but
it
home
then
there
is
nothing
i
can
do
legion
foster
said
to
reward
your
loyalty
and
express
my
gratitude
well
ah
i
said
there
is
a
little
something
let
me
take
the
lifeboat
and
stock
it
with
a
few
goodies
from
the
library
and
some
of
those
marbles
from
the
storeroom
and
a
couple
of
the
smaller
mechanical
gadgets
i
think
i
know
how
to
merchandise
them
in
a
way
that
leave
the
economy
on
an
even
keel
and
incidentally
set
me
up
for
life
as
you
said
i
a
materialist
as
you
wish
foster
said
take
whatever
you
desire
one
thing
i
have
to
do
when
i
get
back
i
said
is
open
the
tunnel
at
stonehenge
enough
to
sneak
a
thermite
bomb
down
it
if
they
have
already
found
the
beacon
station
as
i
judge
the
temper
of
the
local
people
foster
said
the
secret
is
safe
for
at
least
three
generations
i
bring
the
boat
down
in
a
blind
spot
where
radar
wo
pick
it
up
i
said
our
timing
was
good
in
another
few
years
it
have
been
possible
and
this
ship
would
soon
have
been
discovered
foster
said
in
spite
of
screens
i
looked
at
the
great
smooth
sphere
hanging
haloed
against
utter
black
the
pacific
ocean
threw
back
a
brilliant
image
of
the
sun
i
think
i
see
an
island
down
there
that
will
fill
the
bill
perfectly
i
said
and
if
it
does
there
are
a
million
more
to
choose
from
you
changed
legion
foster
said
you
sound
like
a
man
with
a
fair
share
of
de
i
used
to
think
i
was
a
guy
who
never
got
the
breaks
i
said
there
something
about
standing
here
looking
at
the
world
that
makes
that
kind
of
thinking
sound
pretty
dumb
there
everything
down
there
a
man
needs
to
make
his
own
breaks
even
without
a
stock
of
trade
goods
every
world
has
its
rules
of
life
foster
said
some
more
complex
than
others
to
face
your
own
reality
that
the
challenge
me
against
the
universe
i
said
with
those
odds
even
a
loser
can
look
good
i
turned
to
foster
we
in
a
orbit
i
said
we
better
get
moving
i
want
to
put
the
boat
down
in
southern
south
america
i
know
a
place
there
where
i
can
without
answering
too
many
questions
you
have
several
hours
before
the
most
favorable
launch
time
foster
said
there
no
hurry
maybe
not
i
said
but
i
got
a
lot
to
do
i
took
a
last
look
toward
the
majestic
planet
beyond
the
viewscreen
and
i
eager
to
get
started
chapter
viii
i
sat
on
the
terrace
watching
the
sun
go
down
into
the
sea
and
thinking
about
foster
somewhere
out
there
beyond
the
purple
palaces
on
the
far
horizon
in
the
ship
that
had
waited
for
him
for
three
thousand
years
heading
home
at
last
it
was
strange
to
reflect
that
for
him
traveling
near
the
speed
of
light
only
a
few
days
had
passed
while
three
years
went
by
for
me
three
fast
years
that
i
had
made
good
use
of
the
toughest
part
had
been
the
first
few
months
after
i
put
the
lifeboat
down
in
a
cañon
in
the
desert
country
south
of
a
little
town
called
itzenca
in
peru
i
waited
by
the
boat
for
a
week
to
be
sure
the
vigilantes
were
going
to
show
up
full
of
helpful
suggestions
and
embarassing
questions
then
i
hiked
to
town
carrying
a
pack
with
a
few
carefully
selected
items
to
start
my
new
career
it
took
me
two
weeks
to
work
lie
barter
and
plead
my
way
to
the
seaport
town
of
callao
and
another
week
to
line
up
passage
home
as
a
deck
hand
on
a
banana
scow
i
disappeared
over
the
side
at
tampa
and
made
it
to
miami
without
attracting
attention
as
far
as
i
could
tell
the
cops
had
already
lost
interest
in
me
my
old
friend
the
heavyweight
señorita
was
overjoyed
to
see
me
but
she
put
me
up
and
i
started
in
on
my
plan
to
turn
my
souvenirs
into
money
the
items
i
had
brought
with
me
from
the
lifeboat
were
a
pocketful
of
little
gray
dominoes
that
were
actually
movie
film
and
a
small
projector
to
go
with
them
i
did
offer
them
for
sale
direct
i
made
arrangements
with
an
old
acquaintance
in
the
business
of
making
pictures
with
low
costume
budgets
for
private
showings
i
set
up
the
apparatus
and
projected
my
films
and
he
copied
them
in
mm
i
told
him
that
i
smuggled
them
in
from
east
germany
he
did
think
much
of
the
krauts
but
he
admitted
you
had
to
hand
it
to
them
technically
the
special
effects
were
absolutely
his
favorite
was
one
i
called
the
mammoth
hunt
i
had
twelve
pictures
altogether
with
a
little
judicious
cutting
and
a
commentary
they
made
up
into
short
subjects
he
got
in
touch
with
a
friend
in
the
distribution
end
in
new
york
and
after
a
little
cagy
fencing
over
contract
terms
we
agreed
on
a
deal
that
paid
a
hundred
thousand
for
the
twelve
with
an
option
on
another
dozen
at
the
same
price
within
a
week
after
the
pictures
hit
the
neighborhood
theatres
around
bayonne
new
jersey
in
a
cautious
tryout
i
had
offers
up
to
half
a
million
for
my
next
consignment
no
questions
asked
i
left
my
pal
mickey
to
handle
the
details
on
a
percentage
basis
and
headed
back
for
itzenca
the
lifeboat
was
just
as
i
left
it
it
would
have
been
all
right
for
another
fifty
years
as
far
as
the
danger
of
anybody
stumbling
over
it
was
concerned
i
explained
to
the
crew
i
brought
out
with
me
that
it
was
a
fake
rocket
ship
a
prop
i
was
using
for
a
film
i
was
making
i
let
them
wander
all
over
it
and
get
their
curiosity
out
of
their
systems
the
concensus
was
that
it
would
fool
anybody
no
tail
fins
no
ray
guns
and
the
instrument
panel
was
a
joke
but
they
figured
that
it
was
my
money
so
they
went
to
work
setting
up
a
system
of
camouflage
nets
part
of
the
plot
i
told
them
and
my
cargo
a
year
after
my
homecoming
i
had
my
island
a
square
mile
of
perfect
climate
fifteen
miles
off
the
peruvian
coast
and
a
house
that
was
tailored
to
my
every
whim
by
a
architect
who
made
a
fortune
on
the
job
and
earned
it
the
uppermost
floor
almost
a
tower
was
a
and
it
was
there
that
i
had
stored
my
stock
in
trade
i
had
sold
off
the
best
of
the
hundred
or
so
films
i
had
picked
out
before
leaving
foster
but
there
were
plenty
of
other
items
the
projector
itself
was
the
big
prize
the
power
unit
converted
nuclear
energy
to
light
with
percent
efficiency
it
scanned
the
films
one
molecular
layer
at
a
time
and
projected
a
continuous
picture
no
flicker
here
the
color
and
sound
were
absolutely
with
the
result
that
i
had
a
few
complaints
from
my
distributor
that
the
technicolor
was
kind
of
the
principles
involved
in
the
projector
were
new
and
in
theory
at
least
way
over
the
heads
of
our
local
physicists
but
the
practical
application
was
nothing
much
i
figured
that
with
the
right
contacts
in
scientific
circles
to
help
me
introduce
the
system
i
had
a
industry
up
my
sleeve
i
had
already
fed
a
few
little
gimmicks
into
the
market
a
tough
paper
suitable
for
shirts
and
underwear
a
chemical
that
bleached
teeth
white
as
the
driven
snow
an
pigment
for
artists
with
the
knowledge
i
had
absorbed
from
all
the
briefing
rods
i
had
studied
i
had
the
techniques
of
a
hundred
new
industries
at
my
fingertips
and
i
had
exhausted
the
possibilities
yet
i
spent
most
of
a
year
roaming
the
world
discovering
all
the
things
that
a
free
hand
with
a
dollar
bill
could
do
for
a
man
the
next
year
i
put
in
fixing
up
the
island
buying
paintings
and
rugs
and
silver
for
the
house
and
a
concert
grand
piano
after
the
first
big
thrill
of
economic
freedom
had
worn
off
i
still
enjoyed
my
music
for
six
months
i
had
a
physical
instructor
giving
me
a
routine
of
diet
sleep
and
all
the
precision
my
metabolism
could
stand
at
the
end
of
the
course
i
was
twice
the
man
i
ever
been
the
instructor
was
a
physical
wreck
and
i
was
looking
around
for
a
new
hobby
now
after
three
years
it
was
beginning
to
get
me
boredom
the
disease
of
the
idle
rich
that
i
had
sworn
would
never
touch
me
but
thinking
about
wealth
and
having
it
on
your
hands
are
two
different
things
and
i
was
beginning
to
remember
almost
with
nostalgia
the
tough
old
times
when
every
day
was
an
adventure
full
of
cops
and
missed
meals
and
a
thousand
unappeased
desires
not
that
i
was
really
suffering
i
was
relaxed
in
a
comfortable
chair
after
a
day
of
surf
fishing
and
a
modest
dinner
of
chateaubriand
i
was
smoking
a
skinny
cigar
rolled
by
an
expert
from
the
world
finest
leaf
and
listening
to
the
best
music
a
could
produce
and
the
view
though
free
was
worth
a
million
dollars
a
minute
after
a
while
i
would
stroll
down
to
the
boathouse
start
up
the
launch
and
tool
over
to
the
mainland
transfer
to
my
caddie
convertible
and
drive
into
town
where
a
tall
brunette
from
stockholm
was
waiting
for
me
to
take
her
to
the
movies
my
steady
gal
was
a
secretary
for
an
electronics
firm
i
finished
up
my
stogie
and
leaned
forward
to
drop
it
in
a
big
silver
ashtray
when
something
caught
my
eye
out
across
the
water
i
sat
squinting
at
it
then
went
inside
and
came
out
with
a
pair
of
binoculars
i
focused
them
and
studied
the
dark
speck
that
stood
out
clearly
now
against
the
gaudy
sky
it
was
a
power
boat
heading
dead
toward
my
island
i
watched
it
come
closer
swing
off
toward
the
concrete
jetty
i
had
built
below
the
and
ease
alongside
in
a
murmur
of
powerful
engines
they
died
and
the
boat
sat
in
a
sudden
silence
dwarfing
the
pier
i
studied
the
hull
the
inconspicuous
flag
aft
two
heavy
deck
guns
were
mounted
on
the
foredeck
and
there
were
four
torpedoes
slung
in
launching
cradles
the
hardware
make
half
as
much
impression
on
me
as
the
ranks
of
helmeted
men
drawn
up
on
deck
i
sat
and
watched
the
men
shuffled
off
onto
the
pier
formed
up
into
two
squads
i
counted
men
and
a
couple
of
officers
there
was
the
faint
sound
of
orders
being
barked
and
the
column
stepped
off
moving
along
the
paved
road
that
swung
between
the
transplanted
royal
palms
and
hibiscus
right
up
to
the
wide
drive
that
curved
off
to
the
house
they
halted
did
a
left
face
and
stood
at
parade
rest
the
two
officers
wearing
class
a
and
a
tubby
civilian
with
a
brief
case
came
up
the
drive
trying
to
look
as
casual
as
possible
under
the
circumstances
they
paused
at
the
foot
of
the
broad
flight
of
tennessee
marble
steps
leading
up
to
my
perch
the
leading
officer
a
brigadier
general
no
less
looked
up
at
me
may
we
come
up
sir
he
said
i
looked
across
at
the
silent
ranks
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
drive
if
the
boys
want
a
drink
of
water
sarge
i
said
tell
to
come
on
over
i
am
general
smale
the
said
this
is
colonel
sanchez
of
the
peruvian
army
he
indicated
the
other
military
type
and
pruffy
of
the
american
embassy
at
lima
howdy
pruffy
i
said
howdy
sanchez
howdy
this
ah
call
is
official
in
nature
legion
the
general
said
it
a
matter
of
great
importance
involving
the
security
of
your
country
ok
general
i
said
come
on
up
what
happened
you
boys
started
another
war
have
you
they
filed
up
onto
the
terrace
hesitated
then
shook
hands
and
sat
down
gingerly
in
the
chairs
pruffy
held
his
briefcase
in
his
lap
put
your
sandwiches
on
the
table
if
you
like
pruffy
i
said
he
blinked
gripped
the
briefcase
tighter
i
offered
my
cigars
around
pruffy
looked
startled
smale
shook
his
head
and
sanchez
took
three
i
here
the
general
said
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
legion
pruffy
represents
the
department
of
state
in
the
matter
and
colonel
sanchez
do
tell
me
i
said
he
represents
the
peruvian
government
which
is
why
i
do
ask
you
what
an
armed
american
force
is
doing
wandering
around
on
peruvian
soil
here
pruffy
put
in
i
hardly
think
i
believe
you
i
said
what
it
all
about
smale
i
come
directly
to
the
point
he
said
for
some
time
the
investigative
and
security
agencies
of
the
us
government
have
been
building
a
file
on
what
for
lack
of
a
better
name
has
been
called
martians
smale
coughed
apologetically
a
little
over
three
years
ago
he
went
on
an
unidentified
flying
object
you
interested
in
flying
saucers
general
i
said
by
no
means
he
snapped
the
object
appeared
on
a
number
of
radar
screens
descending
from
extreme
altitude
it
came
to
earth
at
he
hesitated
do
tell
me
you
came
all
the
way
out
here
to
tell
me
you
ca
tell
me
i
a
site
in
england
smale
said
american
aircraft
were
dispatched
to
investigate
the
object
before
they
could
make
identification
it
rose
again
accelerated
at
tremendous
speed
and
was
lost
at
an
altitude
of
several
hundred
miles
i
thought
we
had
better
radar
than
that
i
said
the
satellite
program
no
such
specialized
equipment
was
available
smale
said
an
intensive
investigation
turned
up
the
fact
that
two
strangers
possibly
americans
had
visited
the
site
only
a
few
hours
before
the
ah
visitation
i
nodded
i
was
thinking
about
the
close
call
i
had
when
i
went
back
to
see
about
lobbing
a
bomb
down
the
shaft
to
obliterate
the
beacon
station
there
were
plainclothes
men
all
over
the
place
like
old
maids
at
a
movie
star
funeral
it
was
just
as
well
they
never
found
it
the
rocket
blasts
had
collapsed
the
tunnel
and
apparently
the
whole
underground
installation
was
made
of
substances
that
did
show
up
in
detecting
equipment
i
had
an
idea
metal
was
passé
where
foster
came
from
some
months
later
smale
went
on
a
series
of
rather
curious
short
films
went
on
exhibition
in
the
united
states
they
showed
scenes
representing
conditions
on
other
planets
as
well
as
ancient
and
prehistoric
incidents
here
on
earth
they
were
prefaced
with
explanations
that
they
merely
represented
the
opinions
of
science
as
to
what
was
likely
to
be
found
on
distant
worlds
they
attracted
wide
interest
and
with
few
exceptions
scientists
praised
their
verisimilitude
i
admire
a
clever
fake
i
said
with
a
topical
subject
like
space
travel
one
item
which
was
commented
on
as
a
surprising
inaccuracy
in
view
of
the
technical
excellence
of
the
other
films
smale
said
was
the
view
of
our
planet
from
space
showing
the
earth
against
the
backdrop
of
stars
a
study
of
the
constellations
by
astronomers
quickly
indicated
a
approximately
for
the
scene
oddly
the
north
polar
cap
was
shown
centered
on
hudson
bay
no
south
polar
cap
was
in
evidence
the
continent
of
antarctica
appeared
to
be
at
a
latitude
of
some
degrees
entirely
free
of
ice
i
looked
at
him
and
waited
now
studies
made
since
that
time
indicate
that
nine
thousand
years
ago
the
north
pole
was
indeed
centered
on
hudson
bay
smale
said
and
antarctica
was
in
fact
that
idea
been
around
a
long
time
i
said
there
was
a
theory
then
there
was
the
matter
of
the
views
of
mars
the
general
went
on
the
aerial
shots
of
the
were
regarded
as
very
cleverly
done
he
turned
to
pruffy
who
opened
his
briefcase
and
handed
a
couple
of
photos
across
this
is
a
scene
taken
from
the
film
smale
said
it
was
an
color
shot
showing
a
row
of
mounds
drifted
with
pinkish
dust
against
a
horizon
smale
placed
another
photo
beside
the
first
this
one
he
said
was
taken
by
automatic
cameras
in
the
successful
mars
probe
of
last
year
i
looked
the
second
shot
was
fuzzy
and
the
color
was
shifted
badly
toward
the
blue
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
scene
the
mounds
were
drifted
a
little
deeper
and
the
angle
was
different
but
they
were
the
same
mounds
in
the
meantime
smale
bored
on
relentlessly
a
number
of
novel
products
appeared
on
the
market
chemists
and
physicists
alike
were
dumfounded
at
the
theoretical
base
implied
by
the
techniques
involved
one
of
the
products
a
type
of
pigment
embodied
a
completely
new
concept
in
crystallography
progress
i
said
why
when
i
was
a
boy
it
was
an
extremely
tortuous
trail
we
followed
smale
said
but
we
found
that
all
these
curious
observations
making
up
the
file
had
in
the
end
only
one
factor
in
common
and
that
factor
legion
was
you
chapter
ix
it
was
a
few
minutes
after
sunrise
and
smale
and
i
were
back
on
the
terrace
toying
with
the
remains
of
ham
steaks
and
honeydew
that
one
advantage
of
being
in
jail
in
your
own
house
the
good
i
commented
i
can
understand
your
feelings
smale
said
frankly
i
did
relish
this
assignment
but
it
clear
that
there
are
matters
here
which
require
explanation
it
was
my
hope
that
you
see
fit
to
cooperate
voluntarily
take
your
army
and
sail
off
into
the
sunrise
general
i
said
then
maybe
i
be
in
a
position
to
do
something
voluntary
your
patriotism
alone
my
patriotism
keeps
telling
me
that
where
i
come
from
a
citizen
has
certain
legal
rights
i
said
this
is
a
matter
that
transcends
legal
technicalities
smale
said
i
tell
you
quite
frankly
the
presence
of
the
task
force
here
only
received
post
approval
by
the
peruvian
government
they
were
faced
with
the
i
mention
this
only
to
indicate
just
how
strongly
the
government
feels
in
this
matter
seeing
you
hit
the
beach
with
a
platoon
of
infantry
was
enough
of
a
hint
for
me
i
said
you
lucky
i
did
wipe
you
out
with
my
disintegrator
rays
smale
choked
on
a
bite
of
melon
just
kidding
i
said
but
i
have
given
you
any
trouble
why
the
reinforcements
small
stared
at
me
what
reinforcements
i
pointed
with
a
fork
he
turned
gazed
out
to
sea
a
conning
tower
was
breaking
the
surface
leaving
a
white
wake
behind
it
rose
higher
water
streaming
off
the
deck
a
hatch
popped
open
and
men
poured
out
lining
up
smale
got
to
his
feet
his
napkin
falling
to
the
floor
sergeant
he
yelled
i
sat
as
smale
jumped
to
the
stair
went
down
it
three
steps
at
a
time
i
heard
him
bellowing
the
shouts
of
men
and
the
clatter
of
rifles
being
unstacked
feet
pounding
i
went
to
the
marble
banister
and
looked
down
pruffy
was
out
on
the
lawn
in
purple
pajamas
yelping
questions
colonel
sanchez
was
pulling
at
smale
arm
also
yelling
the
marines
were
forming
up
on
the
lawn
let
watch
those
petunias
sergeant
i
yelled
keep
out
of
this
legion
smale
shouted
why
should
i
be
the
only
one
not
yelling
i
yelled
after
all
i
own
the
place
smale
bounded
back
up
the
stairs
you
my
prime
responsibility
legion
he
barked
i
getting
you
to
a
point
of
maximum
security
where
the
cellar
i
keep
it
downstairs
i
said
what
this
all
about
interservice
rivalry
you
afraid
the
sailors
are
going
to
steal
the
glory
that
a
sub
smale
barked
gagarin
class
it
belongs
to
the
soviet
navy
i
stood
there
with
my
mouth
open
looking
at
smale
without
seeing
him
and
trying
hard
to
think
fast
i
had
been
too
startled
when
the
marines
showed
up
i
had
gone
over
the
legal
aspects
of
my
situation
months
before
with
a
platoon
of
legal
talent
i
knew
that
sooner
or
later
somebody
would
come
around
to
hit
me
for
tax
evasion
draft
dodging
or
overtime
parking
but
i
was
in
the
clear
the
government
might
resent
my
knowing
a
lot
of
things
it
did
but
no
one
could
ever
prove
i
swiped
them
from
uncle
sam
in
the
end
have
to
let
me
go
and
my
account
in
a
swiss
bank
would
last
me
even
if
they
managed
to
suppress
any
new
developments
from
my
fabulous
lab
in
a
way
i
was
glad
the
showdown
had
come
but
i
forgotten
about
the
russians
naturally
they
be
interested
and
their
spies
were
at
least
as
good
as
the
intrepid
agents
of
the
us
secret
service
i
should
have
realized
that
sooner
or
later
they
pay
a
call
and
the
legal
niceties
would
slow
them
down
they
slap
me
into
a
brain
laundry
and
sweat
every
last
secret
out
of
me
as
casually
as
i
squeeze
a
lemon
the
sub
was
fully
surfaced
now
and
i
was
looking
down
the
barrels
of
half
a
dozen
rifles
any
one
of
which
could
blast
navy
out
of
the
water
with
one
salvo
there
were
a
couple
of
hundred
men
i
estimated
putting
landing
boats
over
the
side
and
spilling
into
them
down
on
the
lawn
the
sergeant
was
snapping
orders
and
the
men
were
off
to
positions
that
must
have
been
spotted
in
advance
it
looked
like
the
russians
were
entirely
unexpected
this
was
a
game
the
big
boys
were
playing
and
i
was
just
a
pawn
caught
in
the
middle
my
rosy
picture
of
me
confounding
the
bureaucrats
was
fading
fast
my
island
was
about
to
become
a
battlefield
and
whichever
way
it
turned
out
i
be
the
loser
i
had
one
slim
possibility
to
get
lost
in
the
shuffle
smale
grabbed
my
arm
do
stand
there
man
he
snapped
which
way
sorry
general
i
said
and
slammed
a
hard
right
to
his
stomach
he
folded
but
still
managed
to
lunge
for
me
i
gave
him
a
left
to
the
jaw
and
he
dropped
i
jumped
over
him
plunged
through
the
french
doors
and
took
the
spiral
glass
stairway
four
at
a
time
whirled
and
slammed
the
door
behind
me
the
armored
walls
would
stand
anything
short
of
a
direct
hit
with
a
artillery
shell
and
the
boys
down
below
were
unlikely
to
use
any
heavy
stuff
for
fear
of
damaging
the
goods
they
been
sent
out
to
collect
i
was
safe
for
a
little
while
now
i
had
to
do
some
fast
accurate
thinking
i
could
carry
much
with
me
when
and
if
i
made
it
off
the
island
a
few
briefing
rods
maybe
what
was
left
of
the
movies
but
i
had
already
audited
most
of
the
rods
i
knew
them
as
well
as
i
know
my
tax
bracket
one
listen
to
a
rod
gave
you
a
fast
picture
of
the
subject
two
or
three
repeats
engraved
it
on
your
brain
the
only
reason
a
man
could
know
everything
was
that
too
much
too
fast
would
overload
the
mind
and
amnesia
wiped
the
slate
clean
i
did
have
time
to
use
any
more
rods
and
i
could
carry
anything
but
just
to
walk
off
and
leave
it
all
i
rummaged
through
odds
and
ends
stuffing
small
items
into
my
pockets
i
came
across
a
dull
silvery
cylinder
three
inches
long
striped
in
black
and
gold
a
it
reminded
me
of
something
that
was
an
idea
i
still
had
the
plastic
headpiece
that
foster
had
used
to
acquire
a
background
knowledge
of
his
old
home
i
had
tried
it
once
for
a
moment
it
had
given
me
a
headache
in
two
seconds
flat
just
pressed
against
my
temple
it
had
been
lying
here
ever
since
but
maybe
now
was
the
time
to
try
it
again
half
the
items
i
had
here
in
my
were
mysteries
like
the
silver
cylinder
in
my
hand
but
i
knew
exactly
what
the
plastic
headband
could
give
me
it
contained
all
anyone
needed
to
know
about
vallon
and
the
two
worlds
and
all
the
marvels
they
possessed
i
glanced
out
the
window
smale
marines
were
trotting
across
the
lawn
the
russians
were
fanning
out
along
the
water
edge
it
looked
like
business
all
right
still
it
would
take
them
a
while
to
get
warmed
up
and
more
time
still
to
decide
to
blast
me
out
of
my
fort
it
had
taken
an
hour
or
so
for
foster
to
soak
up
the
briefing
maybe
i
would
be
much
longer
at
it
i
tossed
the
cylinder
aside
tried
a
couple
of
drawers
found
the
inconspicuous
strip
of
plastic
that
encompassed
a
whole
civilization
i
carried
it
across
to
a
chair
settled
myself
then
hesitated
this
thing
had
been
designed
for
an
alien
brain
not
mine
suppose
it
burnt
out
my
wiring
left
me
here
gibbering
for
smale
or
the
ruskis
to
work
over
but
the
alternative
was
to
leave
my
island
virtually
settle
for
what
i
might
in
time
manage
to
salvage
from
my
account
if
i
could
devise
a
way
of
withdrawing
money
without
calling
down
the
gestapo
no
i
would
go
back
to
poverty
without
a
struggle
what
i
could
carry
in
my
head
would
give
me
independence
even
immunity
from
the
greed
of
nations
i
could
barter
my
knowledge
for
my
freedom
there
were
plenty
of
things
wrong
with
this
picture
but
it
was
the
best
i
could
do
on
short
notice
gingerly
i
fitted
the
band
to
my
head
there
was
a
feeling
of
pressure
then
a
sensation
like
warm
water
rising
about
me
panic
tried
to
rise
faded
a
voice
seemed
to
reassure
me
i
was
among
friends
i
was
safe
all
was
well
chapter
x
lay
in
the
dark
the
memory
of
towers
and
trumpets
and
fountains
of
fire
in
my
mind
i
put
up
my
hand
felt
a
coarse
garment
had
i
but
dreamed
i
stirred
light
blazed
in
a
widening
band
above
my
face
through
narrowed
eyes
i
saw
a
room
a
mean
chamber
dusty
littered
with
rubbish
in
a
wall
there
was
a
window
i
went
to
it
stared
out
upon
a
green
sward
a
path
that
curved
downward
to
a
white
strand
it
was
a
strange
scene
and
yet
wave
of
vertigo
swept
over
me
faded
i
blinked
tried
to
reached
up
felt
something
clamped
over
my
head
i
pulled
it
off
and
it
fell
to
the
floor
with
a
faint
clatter
a
briefing
device
of
the
type
used
to
indoctrinate
unidentified
citizens
who
had
undergone
a
change
unprepared
suddenly
like
water
pouring
down
a
drain
the
picture
in
my
mind
faded
left
me
standing
in
my
old
familiar
junk
room
with
a
humming
in
my
head
and
a
throb
in
my
temples
i
had
been
about
to
try
the
briefing
gimmick
and
had
wondered
if
it
would
work
it
had
with
a
vengeance
for
a
minute
there
i
had
stumbled
around
the
room
like
a
stranger
yearning
for
dear
old
vallon
i
could
remember
the
feeling
but
it
was
gone
now
i
was
just
me
in
trouble
as
usual
there
were
a
lot
of
tantalizing
ideas
floating
around
in
my
mind
right
at
the
edge
of
consciousness
later
i
have
to
sit
down
and
go
over
them
carefully
right
now
i
had
my
hands
full
two
armies
had
me
cornered
and
all
the
guns
belonged
to
the
opposition
that
part
was
okay
i
did
want
to
fight
anybody
all
i
wanted
out
of
this
situation
was
me
a
rattle
of
gunfire
outside
brought
me
to
the
window
in
a
jump
it
was
the
same
view
as
a
few
moments
before
but
it
made
more
sense
now
there
was
the
still
smoking
wreckage
of
the
pt
boat
sunk
in
ten
feet
of
water
a
few
yards
from
the
end
of
the
jetty
somebody
must
have
tried
to
make
a
run
for
it
the
russian
sub
was
nowhere
in
sight
probably
it
had
landed
the
men
and
backed
out
of
danger
from
any
unexpected
quarter
two
or
three
corpses
lay
in
view
down
by
the
water
edge
from
where
i
stood
i
could
say
whether
they
were
good
guys
or
villains
there
were
more
shots
coming
from
somewhere
off
to
the
left
it
looked
like
the
boys
were
fighting
it
out
old
style
hand
to
hand
with
small
arms
it
figured
after
all
what
they
wanted
was
me
and
all
my
clever
ideas
intact
not
a
smoking
ruin
i
do
know
whether
it
was
my
romantic
streak
or
my
cynical
one
that
had
made
me
drive
the
architect
nuts
putting
secret
passages
in
the
walls
of
my
chateau
and
tunnels
under
the
lawn
but
i
was
glad
now
i
had
them
there
was
a
narrow
door
in
the
west
wall
of
the
that
gave
onto
a
tight
spiral
stair
from
there
i
could
take
my
choice
the
boathouse
the
edge
of
the
woods
behind
the
house
or
the
beach
a
hundred
yards
north
of
the
jetty
all
i
had
to
do
was
the
house
trembled
a
split
second
ahead
of
a
terrific
blast
that
slammed
me
to
the
floor
i
felt
blood
start
from
my
nose
head
ringing
i
scrambled
to
my
feet
groped
through
the
dust
to
my
escape
hatch
somebody
outside
was
getting
impatient
it
would
do
to
have
my
fancy
getaway
route
fall
in
before
i
had
used
it
i
felt
another
shell
hit
the
house
mortars
i
guessed
or
rockets
i
must
have
slept
through
the
preliminaries
and
wakened
just
in
time
for
the
main
bout
my
fingers
were
on
the
sensitive
pressure
areas
that
worked
the
concealed
door
i
took
a
last
glance
around
the
room
where
the
dust
was
just
settling
from
the
last
blast
my
eyes
fell
on
a
plain
cylinder
lying
where
i
had
tossed
it
an
hour
before
but
now
i
knew
what
it
was
in
one
jump
i
was
across
the
room
and
had
grabbed
it
up
i
remembered
finding
it
aboard
the
lifeboat
when
i
tidied
up
it
had
lain
concealed
among
the
bones
of
the
man
with
the
necklace
he
must
have
come
across
it
admired
its
pretty
colors
and
tucked
it
away
in
his
fur
pants
and
now
i
with
my
vallonian
memories
banked
in
my
mind
could
appreciate
just
how
precious
an
object
it
was
it
was
foster
memory
it
would
be
only
a
copy
undoubtedly
still
i
could
leave
it
behind
a
blast
heavier
than
the
last
one
rocked
the
house
a
big
chunk
of
plaster
fell
it
was
way
past
time
to
go
snorting
and
coughing
from
the
dust
i
got
back
to
the
emergency
door
went
through
it
and
started
down
at
the
bottom
i
paused
to
think
it
over
and
the
earth
jumped
again
i
fell
back
saw
the
roof
of
the
beach
tunnel
collapse
that
left
the
woods
and
the
boathouse
i
did
have
much
time
to
decide
the
tunnels
might
go
any
second
apparently
my
architect
had
economized
on
the
tunnel
shorings
but
then
he
had
figured
on
any
major
wars
happening
in
the
front
yard
the
fight
was
going
on
as
near
as
i
could
judge
to
the
south
of
the
house
and
behind
it
probably
the
woods
were
full
of
skirmishers
taking
advantage
of
the
cover
the
best
bet
was
the
boathouse
direct
i
have
preferred
to
wait
until
dark
but
the
idea
did
seem
practical
under
the
circumstances
i
took
a
deep
breath
and
started
into
the
tunnel
with
a
little
luck
i
find
my
boat
intact
i
would
have
to
pull
out
under
the
noses
of
the
combatants
but
maybe
the
element
of
surprise
would
give
me
a
few
hundred
yards
start
i
had
enough
horses
to
beat
anything
afloat
to
the
mainland
if
i
could
make
a
clean
break
the
tunnel
was
dark
but
that
did
bother
me
it
ran
dead
straight
to
the
boathouse
i
came
to
the
wooden
slat
door
and
stood
for
a
moment
listening
everything
was
quiet
i
eased
it
open
and
stepped
on
to
the
ramp
inside
the
building
in
the
gloom
polished
mahogany
and
threw
back
muted
highlights
i
circled
slipped
the
mooring
rope
and
was
about
to
step
into
the
cockpit
when
i
heard
the
bolt
of
a
rifle
smack
home
i
whirled
threw
myself
flat
the
deafening
of
a
calibre
fired
at
close
quarters
laid
a
pattern
of
fine
ripples
on
the
black
water
i
rolled
hit
with
a
splash
that
drowned
a
second
shot
and
dove
deep
three
strokes
took
me
under
the
door
out
into
the
green
gloom
of
open
water
i
hugged
the
yellowish
sand
of
the
bottom
angled
off
to
the
right
and
kept
going
i
had
to
get
out
of
my
jacket
and
somehow
i
managed
it
almost
without
losing
a
stroke
and
there
went
all
the
goodies
i
stashed
away
in
the
pockets
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
drink
i
still
had
it
was
in
my
slacks
and
there
was
time
to
get
out
of
them
nor
to
kick
off
my
tennis
shoes
ten
strokes
fifteen
twenty
i
knew
my
limit
good
strokes
on
a
full
load
of
air
but
i
had
dived
in
a
hurry
and
another
and
one
more
and
up
above
a
man
was
waiting
rifle
aimed
for
my
head
to
break
the
surface
thirty
strokes
and
here
i
come
ready
or
not
i
rolled
on
my
back
got
my
face
above
the
surface
i
got
half
a
gulp
of
fresh
air
before
the
shot
slapped
spray
into
my
face
and
echoed
off
across
the
water
i
sank
like
a
stone
kicked
off
and
made
another
yards
before
i
had
to
come
up
the
rifleman
was
faster
this
time
the
bullet
crossed
my
shoulder
like
a
hot
iron
and
i
was
under
water
again
my
was
weak
now
the
strength
was
draining
from
my
arms
fast
i
had
to
have
air
but
i
could
almost
feel
the
solid
smack
of
a
bullet
against
my
skull
i
had
to
keep
going
my
chest
was
on
fire
and
there
was
a
whirling
blackness
all
around
me
i
felt
consciousness
fading
but
maybe
just
one
more
stroke
from
a
distance
i
observed
the
clumsy
efforts
of
the
swimmer
watched
the
flounderings
of
the
poor
untrained
creature
was
apparent
that
an
override
of
the
autonomic
system
was
required
with
dispatch
i
activated
cortical
area
omicron
the
blood
supply
drew
an
emergency
oxygen
source
from
stored
fats
diverting
the
necessary
energy
to
break
the
molecular
with
the
body
drawing
on
internal
sources
ample
for
six
hundred
seconds
at
maximum
demand
i
stimulated
areas
upsilon
and
mu
i
channeled
full
energy
to
the
muscle
complexes
involved
increased
power
output
to
full
skeletal
tolerance
eliminated
waste
body
drove
through
the
water
with
the
fluid
grace
of
a
i
floated
on
my
back
breathing
in
great
surges
of
cool
air
and
blinking
at
the
crimson
sky
i
had
been
under
water
a
few
yards
from
shore
drowning
then
there
was
an
awareness
like
a
voice
telling
me
what
to
do
from
out
of
the
mass
of
vallionan
knowledge
i
had
acquired
i
had
drawn
what
i
needed
and
now
i
was
here
half
a
mile
from
the
beach
winded
but
intact
but
there
was
no
time
now
to
wonder
at
miracles
i
raised
my
head
and
glanced
toward
the
house
a
column
of
smoke
rose
from
a
gaping
cavity
where
the
bedroom
windows
used
to
be
a
man
jumped
up
darted
across
the
lawn
fell
i
heard
a
shot
a
few
seconds
later
floating
lazily
across
the
still
sunset
water
there
was
no
visible
activity
at
the
water
edge
the
rifleman
was
gone
he
probably
thought
he
finished
me
especially
if
he
had
noticed
blood
in
the
water
i
thought
about
sharks
i
had
heard
of
any
in
this
neighborhood
but
a
little
blood
was
just
the
thing
to
bait
them
in
i
twisted
got
a
look
at
the
throbbing
burn
across
my
left
shoulder
where
the
bullet
had
grazed
it
was
nothing
much
just
a
skin
gouge
it
seem
to
be
bleeding
if
it
had
been
there
was
much
i
could
do
about
it
it
was
no
time
for
worrying
i
had
to
keep
my
mind
on
the
problem
of
getting
to
the
mainland
it
was
a
swim
but
if
the
boys
on
shore
could
keep
each
other
occupied
i
ought
to
be
able
to
make
it
i
thought
again
about
pulling
off
my
pants
and
shoes
but
decided
against
it
i
be
in
awkward
shape
without
them
if
i
made
it
i
felt
beat
as
though
i
had
eaten
all
day
which
was
too
strange
because
i
had
well
at
least
i
would
get
stomach
cramps
while
circling
the
island
from
there
i
strike
out
for
shore
and
the
first
thing
i
would
do
when
i
got
out
of
this
would
be
to
order
the
biggest
rarest
steak
in
south
america
i
took
a
last
look
toward
the
house
i
could
see
fire
inside
it
now
i
guessed
each
side
was
rationalizing
the
destruction
as
denial
to
the
enemy
it
had
been
a
nice
place
and
i
miss
it
some
day
somebody
was
going
to
pay
for
it
chapter
xi
i
sat
at
the
kitchen
table
in
margareta
lima
apartment
and
gnawed
the
last
few
shreds
off
the
stripped
while
my
girl
poured
me
another
cup
of
coffee
now
tell
me
about
it
she
said
why
did
they
burn
your
house
and
how
did
you
succeed
in
getting
here
they
got
so
interested
in
the
fight
they
lost
their
heads
i
said
that
the
only
explanation
i
can
think
of
i
thought
i
be
as
safe
as
a
watch
at
a
pickpockets
convention
i
figured
they
go
to
some
pains
to
avoid
damaging
me
i
guessed
wrong
but
your
own
people
maybe
they
were
right
they
could
afford
to
let
the
ruskis
get
me
funny
if
they
just
thought
to
write
me
a
letter
and
ask
for
my
but
how
did
you
get
covered
with
mud
and
the
blood
stains
on
your
back
i
had
a
nice
long
swim
five
hours
worth
then
another
hour
getting
through
a
mangrove
swamp
lucky
i
had
a
moon
then
a
hike
and
here
i
am
i
hope
you
feeling
better
now
that
you
had
something
to
eat
you
looked
terrible
another
block
and
i
would
have
made
it
i
felt
sucked
dry
the
scratch
on
my
back
is
nothing
but
maybe
the
shock
i
do
know
lie
down
now
and
sleep
said
margareta
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
get
me
some
clothes
i
said
a
grey
suit
white
shirt
black
tie
and
shoes
and
go
to
my
bank
and
draw
some
money
save
five
thousand
oh
yeah
see
if
there
anything
in
the
papers
if
you
see
anybody
hanging
around
the
lobby
when
you
come
back
do
come
up
give
me
a
call
and
i
meet
you
she
stood
up
this
is
really
awful
she
said
ca
your
embassy
did
i
mention
it
a
pruffy
of
the
embassy
came
along
to
hold
smale
hand
not
to
mention
a
colonel
sanchez
i
would
be
surprised
if
the
local
cops
were
in
the
act
by
now
unless
they
all
think
i
dead
that
impression
wo
last
long
after
you
show
up
with
a
nice
fresh
check
on
my
account
and
spend
part
of
it
on
a
suit
i
get
some
sleep
and
light
out
as
soon
as
you
get
back
where
will
you
go
i
get
to
the
airport
and
play
it
by
ear
i
do
think
alerted
everybody
it
was
a
deal
until
it
went
sour
now
they
still
picking
up
the
pieces
the
bank
wo
be
open
for
hours
yet
said
margareta
go
to
sleep
and
do
worry
i
take
care
of
everything
i
made
it
to
the
bedroom
and
slid
out
on
the
big
wide
bed
and
consciousness
slipped
away
like
a
silk
curtain
falling
i
knew
i
was
alone
as
soon
as
i
opened
my
eyes
i
had
heard
anything
but
i
could
feel
someone
in
the
room
i
sat
up
slowly
looked
around
he
was
sitting
in
the
embroidered
chair
by
the
window
an
fellow
in
a
tan
tropical
suit
with
an
unlighted
cigarette
in
his
mouth
and
no
particular
expression
on
his
face
go
ahead
light
up
i
said
do
mind
me
thanks
he
said
in
a
thin
voice
he
took
a
lighter
from
an
inner
pocket
flipped
it
held
it
to
the
cigarette
i
stood
up
there
was
a
blur
of
motion
from
my
visitor
and
the
lighter
was
gone
and
a
revolver
was
in
its
place
you
got
the
wrong
scoop
mister
i
said
i
do
bite
i
rather
you
would
move
suddenly
legion
he
said
he
coughed
his
eyes
on
mine
my
nerves
are
what
they
used
to
be
the
gun
was
still
on
me
which
side
are
you
working
for
i
said
and
can
i
put
my
shoes
on
or
are
you
afraid
i
pull
a
gat
out
of
my
sock
he
rested
the
pistol
on
his
knee
get
completely
dressed
mr
legion
sorry
i
said
no
can
do
no
clothes
he
frowned
slightly
my
jacket
will
be
a
little
small
for
you
he
said
but
i
think
you
can
manage
i
was
sitting
on
the
bed
again
i
going
to
get
out
a
cigarette
i
said
try
not
to
shoot
me
i
reached
for
a
package
on
the
table
lit
up
his
eyes
stayed
on
mine
how
come
you
did
figure
i
was
dead
i
asked
blowing
smoke
at
him
we
checked
the
house
he
said
no
body
why
you
incompetent
asses
you
were
supposed
to
think
i
drowned
that
possibility
was
considered
but
we
made
the
routine
checks
anyway
nice
of
you
to
let
me
sleep
it
out
how
long
have
you
been
here
only
a
few
minutes
he
said
he
glanced
at
his
watch
we
have
to
be
going
in
another
fifteen
what
do
you
want
with
me
i
said
you
blew
up
everything
you
were
interested
in
the
department
wants
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
look
i
just
a
dumb
guy
i
whined
i
do
know
nothing
about
all
that
stuff
i
was
just
the
guy
that
peddled
it
see
he
took
a
drag
on
his
cigarette
squinted
at
me
through
the
smoke
you
ran
up
an
a
average
in
college
he
said
including
english
you
boys
really
do
your
homework
i
looked
at
the
pistol
i
wonder
if
you
really
shoot
me
i
mused
i
try
to
make
the
position
clear
he
said
just
to
avoid
any
unfortunate
misunderstanding
my
instructions
are
to
bring
you
in
alive
if
possible
if
it
appears
that
you
may
evade
arrest
or
fall
into
the
wrong
hands
i
be
forced
to
use
the
gun
i
pulled
my
shoes
on
thinking
it
over
my
best
chance
to
make
a
break
was
now
while
there
was
only
one
watchdog
but
i
had
a
feeling
he
was
telling
the
truth
about
shooting
me
i
had
already
seen
the
boys
in
action
at
the
house
he
got
up
let
step
into
the
living
room
mr
legion
i
moved
past
him
through
the
door
in
the
living
room
the
clock
on
the
mantel
said
eleven
i
been
asleep
for
five
or
six
hours
margareta
ought
to
be
getting
back
any
minute
put
this
on
he
said
i
took
the
light
jacket
wedged
myself
into
it
looked
at
my
reflection
in
the
big
rectangular
mirror
that
occupied
most
of
a
wall
above
the
low
divan
it
not
the
real
me
i
said
i
usually
the
telephone
rang
i
looked
at
my
watchdog
he
shook
his
head
we
stood
and
listened
to
it
ring
after
a
while
it
stopped
we
better
be
going
now
he
said
walk
ahead
of
me
please
take
the
elevator
to
the
basement
and
leave
by
the
service
entrance
he
stopped
talking
eyes
on
the
door
there
was
the
rattle
of
a
key
the
gun
came
up
hold
it
i
snapped
it
the
girl
who
owns
the
apartment
i
moved
to
face
him
my
back
to
the
door
that
was
foolish
of
you
legion
he
said
do
move
again
i
watched
the
door
in
the
big
mirror
on
the
opposite
wall
the
knob
turned
the
door
swung
in
and
a
thin
brown
man
in
white
shirt
and
white
pants
slipped
into
the
room
as
he
pushed
the
door
back
he
transferred
a
small
automatic
to
his
left
hand
my
keeper
threw
a
lever
on
the
revolver
that
was
aimed
at
my
belt
buckle
stand
absolutely
still
legion
he
said
if
you
have
a
chance
that
it
he
moved
aside
slightly
looked
past
me
to
the
newcomer
i
watched
in
the
mirror
as
the
man
in
white
behind
me
swiveled
to
keep
both
of
us
covered
this
is
a
weapon
said
my
first
owner
to
the
new
man
i
think
you
know
about
them
we
leaked
the
information
to
you
holding
the
trigger
back
if
my
hand
relaxes
it
fires
so
i
be
a
little
careful
about
shooting
if
i
were
you
the
thin
man
swallowed
a
black
leather
bow
tie
bobbing
against
his
adam
apple
he
did
say
anything
he
was
having
to
make
some
tough
decisions
his
instructions
would
be
the
same
as
my
other
friend
to
bring
me
in
alive
if
possible
who
does
this
bird
represent
i
asked
my
man
i
noticed
my
voice
was
pitched
half
an
octave
higher
than
usual
he
a
soviet
agent
i
looked
in
the
mirror
at
the
man
again
nuts
i
said
he
looks
like
a
waiter
in
a
chili
joint
he
probably
came
up
to
take
our
order
you
talk
too
much
when
you
nervous
said
my
keeper
between
his
teeth
he
held
the
gun
on
me
steadily
i
watched
his
trigger
finger
to
see
if
it
looked
like
relaxing
i
say
it
a
stalemate
i
said
let
take
it
once
more
from
the
top
both
of
you
go
out
and
shut
up
legion
my
man
licked
his
lips
glanced
at
my
face
sorry
it
looks
as
though
you
do
want
to
shoot
me
i
blurted
out
loudly
in
the
mirror
i
had
seen
the
door
which
was
standing
ajar
ease
open
an
inch
two
inches
you
spoil
this
nice
coat
i
kept
on
talking
and
anyway
it
would
be
a
big
mistake
because
everybody
knows
russian
agents
are
stubby
men
with
wide
cheekbones
and
tight
hats
silently
margareta
slipped
into
the
room
took
two
quick
steps
and
slammed
a
heavy
handbag
down
on
the
pompadour
that
went
with
the
adam
apple
the
man
in
white
stumbled
and
fired
a
round
into
the
rug
the
automatic
dropped
from
his
hand
and
my
pal
in
tan
stepped
to
him
and
hit
him
hard
on
the
back
of
the
head
with
his
pistol
he
whirled
toward
me
hissed
play
it
smart
just
loud
enough
for
me
to
hear
then
turned
to
margareta
he
slipped
the
gun
into
his
pocket
but
i
knew
he
could
get
it
out
again
in
a
hurry
very
nicely
done
miss
he
said
i
have
this
person
removed
from
your
apartment
legion
and
i
were
just
going
margareta
looked
at
me
i
thought
over
two
or
three
remarks
but
none
of
them
seemed
to
fit
i
did
intend
to
see
her
get
hurt
or
involved
apparently
my
fbi
type
was
willing
to
leave
her
out
of
it
if
i
went
quietly
on
the
other
hand
this
was
my
last
chance
to
get
out
of
the
net
before
it
closed
for
good
my
keeper
was
watching
waiting
for
me
to
try
something
tip
margareta
off
it
okay
honey
i
said
this
is
smith
of
our
embassy
we
old
friends
i
stepped
past
her
headed
for
the
door
my
hand
was
on
the
knob
when
i
heard
a
solid
thunk
behind
me
i
whirled
in
time
to
clip
the
fbi
on
the
jaw
as
he
fell
forward
margareta
looked
at
me
that
handbag
packs
a
wallop
i
said
nice
work
maggie
i
knelt
pulled
off
the
fellow
belt
and
cinched
his
hands
behind
his
back
with
it
margareta
got
the
idea
did
the
same
for
the
other
man
who
was
beginning
to
groan
now
who
are
these
men
she
said
what
i
tell
you
all
about
it
later
right
now
i
have
to
get
to
some
people
i
know
get
this
story
on
the
wires
out
in
the
open
be
a
little
shy
about
gunning
me
down
or
locking
me
up
without
trial
if
i
give
the
show
enough
publicity
i
reached
in
my
pocket
handed
her
the
cylinder
just
to
be
on
the
safe
side
i
said
mail
this
to
me
john
jones
at
itzenca
general
delivery
all
right
said
margareta
and
i
have
your
things
she
stepped
into
the
hall
came
back
with
a
shopping
bag
and
a
suit
carton
she
took
a
wad
of
bills
from
her
handbag
and
handed
it
to
me
i
went
to
her
and
put
my
arms
around
her
listen
honey
as
soon
as
i
leave
go
to
the
bank
and
draw
fifty
grand
get
out
of
the
country
they
have
got
anything
on
you
except
that
you
beaned
a
couple
of
intruders
in
your
apartment
but
it
be
better
if
you
disappear
leave
an
address
care
of
poste
restante
basel
switzerland
i
get
in
touch
when
i
can
she
put
up
an
argument
but
i
made
my
point
twenty
minutes
later
i
was
pushing
through
the
big
glass
doors
onto
the
sidewalk
dressed
to
the
teeth
with
five
grand
on
one
hip
and
a
on
the
other
i
had
a
good
meal
and
a
fair
sleep
and
against
me
the
secret
services
of
two
or
three
countries
did
have
a
chance
i
got
as
far
as
the
corner
before
they
nailed
me
chapter
xii
you
have
a
great
deal
to
lose
general
smale
was
saying
and
nothing
to
gain
by
your
stubbornness
you
a
young
man
vigorous
and
sure
intelligent
you
have
a
fortune
of
some
million
and
a
quarter
dollars
which
i
assure
you
you
be
permitted
to
keep
as
against
that
prospect
so
long
as
you
refuse
to
cooperate
we
must
regard
you
as
no
better
than
a
traitorous
criminal
and
deal
with
you
accordingly
what
have
you
been
feeding
me
i
said
my
mouth
tastes
like
somebody
old
gym
shoes
and
my
arm
purple
to
the
elbow
do
you
know
it
illegal
to
administer
drugs
without
a
license
the
nation
security
is
at
stake
snapped
smale
the
funny
thing
is
it
must
not
have
worked
or
you
would
be
begging
me
to
tell
all
i
thought
that
scopolamine
or
whatever
using
was
the
real
goods
we
gotten
nothing
but
gibberish
smale
said
most
of
it
in
an
incomprehensible
language
who
the
devil
are
you
legion
where
do
you
come
from
you
know
everything
i
said
you
told
me
yourself
i
a
guy
named
legion
from
mount
sterling
illinois
population
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
i
a
humane
man
legion
but
if
necessary
i
beat
it
out
of
you
you
i
smiled
curling
a
lip
you
mean
you
call
in
a
herd
of
real
crooks
to
do
the
dirty
work
my
only
crime
is
knowing
something
you
politicians
want
and
you
willing
to
lie
cheat
steal
torture
and
kill
to
get
it
you
know
that
and
so
do
i
let
not
kid
each
other
i
know
your
measure
as
a
man
mr
general
smale
had
gone
white
i
in
a
position
to
inflict
agonies
on
you
you
insolent
rotter
he
grated
i
refrained
from
doing
so
you
might
add
that
to
your
analysis
of
my
character
i
a
soldier
i
know
my
duty
i
prepared
to
give
my
life
if
need
be
my
honor
even
prepared
to
forego
your
good
opinion
so
long
as
i
obtain
for
my
government
the
information
you
withholding
turn
me
loose
then
ask
me
in
a
nice
way
as
far
as
i
know
i
got
anything
of
military
significance
to
tell
you
but
if
i
were
treated
as
a
free
citizen
i
might
be
inclined
to
let
you
be
the
judge
of
that
tell
us
now
then
you
go
free
sure
i
said
i
invented
a
combination
rocket
ship
and
time
machine
i
traveled
around
the
solar
system
and
made
a
few
short
trips
back
into
history
in
my
spare
time
i
invented
other
gadgets
i
planning
to
take
out
patents
so
naturally
i
do
intend
to
spill
any
secrets
can
i
go
now
smale
got
to
his
feet
until
we
can
safely
move
you
you
remain
in
this
room
you
on
the
floor
of
the
yordano
building
the
windows
are
of
unbreakable
glass
in
case
you
contemplate
a
particularly
untidy
suicide
your
person
has
been
stripped
of
all
potentially
dangerous
items
though
i
suppose
you
could
still
swallow
your
tongue
and
suffocate
the
door
is
of
heavy
construction
and
securely
locked
i
forgot
to
tell
you
i
said
i
mailed
a
letter
to
a
friend
telling
him
all
about
you
the
sheriff
will
be
here
with
a
posse
any
minute
now
to
spring
me
you
mailed
no
letter
smale
said
unfortunately
we
do
feel
it
would
be
advisable
to
allow
any
furniture
to
remain
here
which
you
might
be
foolish
enough
to
dismantle
for
use
as
a
weapon
it
rather
a
drab
room
to
spend
your
future
in
but
until
you
decide
to
cooperate
this
will
be
your
world
i
did
say
anything
i
sat
on
the
floor
and
watched
him
leave
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
two
uniformed
men
outside
the
door
no
doubt
take
turns
looking
through
the
peephole
i
have
solitude
without
privacy
i
wondered
if
margareta
had
managed
to
mail
the
cylinder
i
stretched
out
on
the
floor
which
was
padded
with
a
nice
thick
rug
presumably
so
that
i
would
beat
my
brains
out
against
it
just
to
spite
them
i
was
way
behind
on
my
sleep
being
interrogated
while
unconscious
was
a
very
restful
procedure
i
was
too
worried
in
spite
of
what
smale
said
they
could
keep
me
here
forever
maybe
margareta
had
gotten
clear
and
told
the
story
to
some
newsmen
this
kind
of
thing
could
stay
hidden
forever
or
could
it
i
thought
about
what
smale
had
said
about
my
talking
gibberish
under
the
narcotics
that
was
an
odd
one
quite
suddenly
i
got
it
by
means
of
the
drugs
they
must
have
tapped
a
level
where
the
vallonian
background
briefing
was
stored
they
been
firing
questions
at
a
set
of
memories
that
did
speak
english
i
grinned
then
laughed
out
loud
luck
was
still
in
the
saddle
with
me
the
glass
was
in
double
panels
set
in
aluminum
frames
and
sealed
with
a
plastic
strip
the
space
between
the
two
panels
of
glass
was
evacuated
of
air
creating
an
insulating
barrier
against
the
heat
of
the
sun
i
ran
a
finger
over
the
aluminum
it
was
dural
good
tough
stuff
if
i
had
something
to
pry
with
i
might
possibly
lever
the
metal
away
from
the
glass
far
enough
to
take
a
crack
at
the
edge
the
weak
point
of
if
i
had
something
to
hit
it
with
smale
had
done
a
good
job
of
stripping
the
room
and
me
i
had
my
shirt
and
pants
and
shoes
but
no
tie
or
belt
i
still
had
my
wallet
empty
a
pack
of
cigarettes
with
two
wilted
weeds
in
it
and
a
box
of
matches
smale
had
missed
a
bet
i
might
set
fire
to
my
hair
and
burn
to
the
ground
i
might
also
stuff
a
sock
down
my
throat
and
strangle
or
hang
myself
with
a
shoe
lace
but
i
was
going
to
i
looked
at
the
window
some
more
the
door
was
too
tough
to
tackle
and
the
heavies
outside
were
probably
hoping
for
an
excuse
to
work
me
over
they
would
expect
me
to
go
after
the
glass
after
all
i
was
still
stories
up
what
would
i
do
if
i
did
make
it
to
the
window
sill
but
we
could
worry
about
that
later
after
i
had
smelled
the
fresh
air
my
forefinger
found
an
irregularity
in
the
smooth
metal
a
short
groove
i
looked
closer
saw
a
screw
head
set
flush
with
the
aluminum
surface
maybe
if
the
frame
was
bolted
together
no
such
luck
the
screw
i
had
found
was
the
only
one
what
was
it
for
maybe
if
i
removed
it
i
find
out
but
i
wait
until
dark
to
try
it
smale
had
left
a
light
fixture
in
the
room
after
sundown
i
be
able
to
work
unobserved
a
couple
of
hours
went
by
and
no
one
came
to
disturb
my
solitude
not
even
to
feed
me
maybe
they
planned
to
starve
me
out
or
maybe
they
were
used
to
being
jailers
and
had
forgotten
the
animals
had
to
be
fed
i
had
a
short
scrap
of
metal
i
worked
loose
from
my
wallet
it
was
mild
steel
flimsy
stuff
only
about
an
inch
long
but
i
was
hoping
the
screw
might
not
be
set
too
tight
aluminum
threads
strip
pretty
easily
so
it
probably
was
cinched
up
too
hard
there
was
no
point
in
theorizing
it
was
dark
now
i
give
it
a
try
i
went
to
the
window
fitted
the
edge
of
metal
into
the
slotted
and
twisted
it
turned
just
like
that
i
backed
it
off
ten
turns
twenty
it
was
a
thick
bolt
with
fine
threads
it
came
free
and
air
whooshed
into
the
hole
the
screw
apparently
sealed
the
panel
after
the
air
was
evacuated
i
thought
it
over
if
i
could
fill
the
space
between
the
panels
with
water
and
let
it
freeze
quite
a
trick
in
the
tropics
i
might
as
well
plan
to
fill
it
with
gin
and
set
it
on
fire
i
was
going
in
circles
every
idea
i
had
started
with
i
needed
something
i
could
manage
with
the
materials
at
hand
cloth
a
box
of
matches
a
few
bits
of
paper
i
got
out
a
cigarette
lit
up
and
while
the
match
was
burning
examined
the
hole
from
which
i
removed
the
plug
it
was
about
of
an
inch
in
diameter
and
an
inch
deep
and
there
was
a
hole
near
the
bottom
communicating
with
the
air
space
between
the
glass
panels
it
was
an
method
of
manufacture
but
it
seemed
to
have
worked
all
right
the
air
was
pumped
out
and
the
hole
sealed
with
the
screw
it
had
at
any
rate
the
advantage
of
being
easy
to
service
if
the
panel
leaked
now
with
some
way
of
pumping
air
i
could
blow
out
the
panels
there
was
no
pump
on
the
premises
but
i
did
have
some
chemicals
the
match
heads
they
were
old
style
too
like
a
lot
of
things
in
peru
the
kind
i
sat
on
the
floor
and
started
to
work
chipping
the
heads
off
the
matchsticks
collecting
the
dry
purplish
material
on
a
scrap
of
paper
matches
gave
me
a
respectable
sample
i
packed
it
together
rolled
it
in
the
paper
and
crimped
the
ends
then
i
tucked
the
makeshift
firecracker
into
the
hole
the
screw
had
come
from
using
the
metal
scrap
i
scraped
at
the
threads
of
the
screw
burring
them
then
i
started
it
in
the
hole
half
a
dozen
turns
until
it
came
up
against
the
match
heads
the
shoes
margareta
had
bought
me
were
the
latest
thing
in
lima
styles
with
thin
soles
pointed
toes
and
leather
heels
bad
on
the
feet
but
just
the
thing
to
pound
with
i
thought
about
trying
to
work
loose
a
piece
of
rug
to
shield
my
face
but
decided
against
it
have
to
stand
aside
and
take
my
chances
i
took
the
shoe
by
the
toe
and
hefted
it
the
flexible
sole
gave
it
a
good
action
like
a
sap
there
were
still
a
couple
of
in
the
equation
but
a
healthy
crack
on
the
screw
ought
to
drive
it
against
the
packed
hard
enough
to
detonate
them
and
the
expanding
gasses
from
the
explosion
ought
to
exert
enough
pressure
against
the
glass
panels
to
break
them
i
know
in
a
second
i
flattened
myself
against
the
wall
brought
the
shoe
up
and
laid
it
on
the
with
everything
i
had
there
was
a
deafening
boom
a
blast
of
hot
air
and
a
chemical
stink
then
a
gust
of
cool
night
wind
and
i
was
on
the
sill
my
back
to
the
street
six
hundred
feet
below
my
fingers
groping
for
a
hold
on
the
ledge
above
the
window
i
found
a
grip
pulled
up
reached
higher
got
my
feet
on
the
muntin
strip
paused
to
rest
for
three
seconds
reached
again
i
pulled
my
feet
above
the
window
level
and
heard
shouts
in
the
room
below
fool
killed
himself
get
a
light
in
here
i
clung
breathing
deep
and
murmured
thanks
to
the
architect
who
had
stressed
a
strong
horizontal
element
in
his
façade
and
arranged
the
strip
windows
in
bays
set
twelve
inches
from
the
face
of
the
structure
now
if
the
boys
below
would
keep
their
eyes
on
the
street
long
enough
for
me
to
get
on
the
roof
i
looked
up
to
get
an
idea
how
far
i
have
to
go
and
gripped
the
ledge
convulsively
as
the
whole
building
leaned
out
tilting
me
back
cold
sweat
ran
into
my
eyes
i
squeezed
the
stone
until
my
knuckles
creaked
and
held
on
i
laid
my
cheek
against
the
rough
plaster
listening
to
my
heart
thump
adrenalin
and
high
hopes
had
gotten
me
this
far
and
now
it
had
all
drained
out
and
left
me
a
frail
animal
flattened
against
the
cruel
face
of
a
tower
like
a
fly
on
a
ceiling
with
nothing
between
me
and
the
unyielding
concrete
below
but
the
feeble
grip
of
fingers
and
toes
i
started
to
yell
for
help
and
the
words
stuck
in
my
dry
throat
i
breathed
in
shallow
gasps
feeling
my
muscles
tightening
until
i
hung
rigid
as
a
board
afraid
even
to
roll
my
eyeballs
for
fear
of
dislodging
myself
i
closed
my
eyes
felt
my
hands
going
numb
and
tried
again
to
yell
only
a
thin
croak
emerged
a
minute
earlier
i
had
had
only
one
worry
that
they
look
up
and
see
me
now
my
worst
fear
was
that
they
would
this
was
the
end
i
been
close
before
but
not
like
this
my
fingers
could
take
the
strain
for
maybe
another
minute
maybe
even
two
then
i
let
go
and
the
wind
would
whip
at
me
for
a
few
timeless
seconds
before
i
hit
i
had
had
a
lot
of
big
ideas
but
in
the
cosmic
scheme
i
was
a
gnat
on
a
windshield
i
thought
i
learned
something
was
a
jump
ahead
of
most
guys
and
could
play
the
meaningless
game
with
a
certain
flair
but
my
fancy
philosophies
were
words
written
in
smoke
when
they
came
up
against
the
raw
power
of
blind
instinct
my
conscious
mind
had
an
of
but
the
idiot
subconscious
that
had
frozen
me
here
learned
anything
since
the
first
ape
that
had
owned
it
rode
out
a
storm
in
a
and
lived
to
be
my
ancestor
i
heard
a
sound
and
it
was
me
whimpering
i
was
a
poor
weakling
out
of
his
element
bleating
for
mercy
down
inside
of
me
something
did
like
the
picture
a
small
defiance
flickered
found
a
foothold
burned
brighter
i
would
die
but
that
would
solve
a
lot
of
problems
and
if
i
had
to
die
at
least
i
could
die
trying
my
mind
moved
in
to
take
over
from
my
body
it
was
the
body
that
was
wasting
my
last
strength
on
a
precarious
illusion
of
safety
numbing
my
senses
paralyzing
me
it
was
a
tyranny
i
would
accept
i
needed
a
cool
head
and
a
steady
hand
and
an
unimpaired
sense
of
balance
and
if
the
imbecile
body
would
cooperate
the
mind
would
take
it
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
force
it
i
been
feeding
this
hulk
for
years
now
it
would
do
what
i
told
it
first
loosen
the
grip
yes
if
it
killed
me
bend
those
fingers
sure
i
might
fall
all
the
way
and
splatter
when
i
hit
but
did
this
lousy
slab
of
meat
expect
to
live
forever
i
had
news
for
it
time
was
short
any
way
you
figured
i
was
standing
a
little
looser
now
my
hands
resting
flat
my
legs
taking
the
load
i
had
a
good
wide
ledge
to
stand
on
nearly
a
foot
and
in
a
minute
i
was
going
to
reach
up
and
get
a
new
hold
and
lift
one
foot
at
a
time
and
if
i
slipped
at
least
i
have
done
it
my
way
i
let
go
and
the
building
leaned
out
and
to
hell
with
it
i
felt
for
the
next
ledge
gripped
it
pulled
up
found
a
sure
i
was
dead
it
was
a
long
way
to
the
top
and
there
was
a
fancy
cornice
i
never
get
over
but
when
the
moment
came
and
i
started
the
long
ride
down
i
thumb
my
nose
at
the
old
hag
instinct
who
been
as
tough
as
she
thought
she
was
i
was
under
the
cornice
now
hanging
on
for
a
breather
and
listening
to
the
hooting
and
hollering
from
the
window
far
below
a
couple
of
heads
had
popped
out
and
taken
a
look
but
it
was
dark
up
where
i
was
and
all
the
attention
was
centered
down
where
the
crowd
had
gathered
and
lights
were
playing
looking
for
a
mess
pretty
soon
now
begin
to
get
the
drift
so
i
better
be
going
i
looked
up
at
the
overhang
and
felt
the
old
urge
to
clutch
and
hang
on
so
i
leaned
outward
a
little
further
just
to
show
me
who
was
boss
it
was
a
long
reach
and
i
have
to
risk
it
all
on
one
lunge
because
if
i
missed
there
was
any
net
and
my
fingers
knew
it
i
heard
my
nails
rasp
on
the
plaster
i
grated
my
teeth
together
and
unhooked
one
hand
it
was
like
a
claw
carved
from
wood
i
took
a
bent
my
knees
slightly
they
were
as
responsive
as
a
couple
of
bolted
on
to
the
hip
tough
but
it
was
now
or
never
i
let
go
with
both
hands
and
stretched
leaning
back
my
wooden
hands
bumped
the
edge
scrabbled
hooked
on
as
my
legs
swung
free
and
i
was
hanging
like
an
sailor
strung
up
by
the
thumbs
a
wind
off
the
roof
whipped
at
my
face
and
now
i
was
a
doll
fluttering
in
the
breeze
i
had
to
pull
now
pull
hard
heave
myself
up
and
over
the
edge
but
i
was
tired
too
tired
my
crepe
paper
arms
with
the
wooden
hands
seemed
to
belong
to
someone
else
someone
who
been
dead
a
long
time
but
the
someone
was
me
death
was
an
old
story
one
that
i
wrote
myself
this
was
something
that
had
happened
before
long
ago
and
the
palindrome
of
life
was
finished
where
it
started
and
a
dark
curtain
was
falling
then
from
the
darkness
a
voice
was
speaking
in
a
strange
language
a
confusion
of
strange
thought
symbols
but
through
them
an
ever
more
insistent
call
dilate
the
secondary
vascular
complex
shunt
full
conductivity
to
the
upsilon
now
stripping
oxygen
ions
from
fatty
cell
masses
pour
in
energy
to
the
sinews
with
a
smooth
surge
of
power
i
pulled
myself
up
fell
forward
rolled
onto
my
back
and
lay
on
the
flat
roof
the
beautiful
flat
roof
still
warm
from
the
day
sun
i
was
here
looking
at
the
stars
safe
and
later
on
when
i
had
more
time
i
stop
to
think
about
it
but
now
i
had
to
move
before
they
had
time
to
organize
themselves
cordon
off
the
building
and
start
a
search
staggering
from
the
exertion
of
the
long
climb
i
got
to
my
feet
went
to
the
shed
housing
the
entry
to
the
service
stair
the
door
was
locked
i
did
waste
any
time
kicking
at
it
i
got
a
leg
up
and
stood
on
the
doorknob
two
jumps
and
it
snapped
off
i
pushed
the
stub
of
the
shaft
through
and
tickled
the
back
edge
of
the
locking
tongue
eased
it
out
the
door
opened
a
short
flight
of
steps
led
down
to
a
storeroom
there
were
dusty
boards
paint
cans
odd
tools
i
picked
up
a
length
of
and
a
hammer
with
one
claw
missing
and
stepped
out
into
the
hall
the
street
was
a
long
way
down
and
i
did
feel
like
wasting
time
with
stairs
i
found
the
elevator
pushed
the
button
stood
in
front
of
it
whistling
a
fat
man
in
a
drab
suit
came
along
looked
at
me
distastefully
thought
about
telling
me
that
workmen
used
the
freight
elevator
then
changed
his
mind
and
said
nothing
the
elevator
arrived
i
stepped
in
jauntily
the
fat
man
followed
me
pushed
the
button
for
the
foyer
i
smiled
and
nodded
went
on
whistling
we
stopped
and
the
doors
opened
i
waited
for
the
fat
man
to
leave
then
glanced
out
tightening
my
grip
on
the
hammer
and
followed
i
could
see
the
lights
in
the
street
out
front
and
in
the
distance
there
was
the
wail
of
a
siren
but
nobody
in
the
lobby
looked
my
way
i
headed
across
toward
the
side
exit
dumped
the
board
at
the
door
tucked
the
hammer
in
the
waist
band
of
my
pants
and
stepped
out
onto
the
pavement
there
were
a
lot
of
people
hurrying
past
but
this
was
lima
they
did
waste
a
glance
on
a
barefooted
carpenter
i
moved
off
not
hurrying
there
was
a
lot
of
rough
country
between
me
and
itzenca
the
little
town
near
which
the
life
boat
was
hidden
in
a
cañon
but
i
aimed
to
cover
it
in
a
week
some
time
between
now
and
tomorrow
i
have
to
figure
out
a
way
to
equip
myself
with
a
few
necessities
but
i
was
worried
a
man
who
had
successfully
taken
up
work
in
middle
life
would
have
any
trouble
stealing
a
pair
of
boots
foster
had
shoved
off
for
home
three
years
ago
local
time
although
to
him
aboard
the
ship
only
a
few
weeks
might
have
passed
my
lifeboat
was
a
midge
compared
to
the
mother
ship
he
rode
but
it
had
plenty
of
speed
once
aboard
the
lugger
and
maybe
i
could
put
a
little
space
between
me
and
the
big
boys
i
was
up
against
now
i
had
used
the
best
camouflage
i
knew
of
on
the
boat
the
native
bearers
who
had
done
my
unloading
and
carried
my
vallonian
treasures
across
the
desert
to
the
nearest
railhead
were
not
the
gossipy
type
if
general
smale
boys
had
heard
about
the
boat
they
had
mentioned
it
and
if
they
had
well
i
solve
that
one
when
i
got
to
it
there
were
still
quite
a
few
in
the
equation
but
my
arithmetic
was
getting
better
all
the
time
chapter
xiii
i
took
the
precaution
of
sneaking
up
on
the
lifeboat
in
the
dead
of
night
but
i
could
have
saved
myself
a
crawl
except
for
the
fact
that
the
camouflage
nets
had
rotted
away
to
shreds
the
ship
was
just
as
i
had
left
it
doors
sealed
why
smale
team
had
found
it
i
know
i
think
that
one
over
when
i
was
well
away
from
earth
it
had
been
a
long
tough
trip
from
lima
to
the
cañon
but
i
had
made
it
without
interference
i
had
swapped
my
platinum
finger
ring
for
a
pistol
but
i
had
had
to
use
it
in
a
shabby
bar
in
one
of
the
villages
i
passed
through
i
had
heard
a
battered
radio
sputtering
news
there
was
no
mention
of
the
assault
on
the
island
or
of
my
escape
it
seemed
that
all
parties
were
willing
to
cover
it
up
and
pretend
it
had
happened
i
went
into
the
post
office
at
itzenca
and
picked
up
the
parcel
margareta
had
mailed
me
with
foster
in
it
while
i
was
checking
to
see
whether
uncle
sam
minions
had
intercepted
the
package
and
substituted
a
carrot
i
felt
something
rubbing
against
my
shin
i
glanced
down
and
saw
a
grey
and
white
cat
reasonably
clean
and
obviously
hungry
i
do
know
whether
i
ploughed
through
a
field
of
wild
catnip
the
night
before
or
if
it
was
my
way
with
a
finger
behind
the
furry
ears
but
kitty
followed
me
out
of
itzenca
and
right
into
the
bush
she
kept
pace
with
me
leading
most
of
the
time
as
far
as
the
space
boat
and
was
the
first
one
aboard
i
did
waste
time
with
formalities
i
had
once
audited
a
briefing
rod
on
the
boat
operation
not
that
i
had
ever
expected
to
use
the
information
for
a
once
aboard
i
hit
the
controls
and
cut
a
swathe
through
the
atmosphere
that
must
have
sent
fingers
jumping
for
panic
buttons
from
washington
to
moscow
i
did
know
how
many
weeks
or
months
of
unsullied
leisure
stretched
ahead
of
me
now
there
would
be
time
and
to
spare
for
exploring
the
boat
working
out
a
daily
routine
chewing
over
the
details
of
both
my
memories
and
laying
plans
for
my
arrival
on
foster
world
vallon
but
first
i
wanted
to
catch
a
show
that
was
making
a
stand
for
me
only
the
spectacle
of
the
retreating
earth
i
dropped
into
a
seat
opposite
the
screen
and
flipped
into
view
the
big
luminous
ball
of
wool
that
was
my
home
planet
i
been
hoping
to
get
a
last
look
at
my
island
but
i
could
see
it
the
whole
sphere
was
blanketed
in
cloud
a
thin
worn
blanket
in
places
but
still
intact
but
the
moon
was
a
sight
an
undipped
edam
cheese
with
the
markings
of
roquefort
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
watched
it
grow
until
it
filled
my
screen
it
was
too
close
for
comfort
i
dumped
the
tabby
out
of
my
lap
and
adjusted
a
dial
the
dead
world
swept
past
and
i
had
a
brief
glimpse
of
burst
bubbles
of
craters
that
became
the
eyes
and
mouth
and
pock
marks
of
a
face
on
a
head
that
swung
away
from
me
in
disdain
and
then
the
sibling
planets
dwindled
and
were
gone
forever
the
lifeboat
was
completely
equipped
and
i
found
comfortable
quarters
an
ample
food
supply
was
available
by
the
touch
of
a
panel
on
the
table
in
the
that
was
a
trick
my
predecessor
with
the
dental
jewelery
had
discovered
i
guessed
during
the
courses
of
my
first
journey
earthward
and
on
my
visits
to
the
boat
for
saleable
playthings
while
she
lay
in
i
had
discovered
most
of
the
available
amenities
aboard
now
i
luxuriated
in
a
steaming
bath
of
recycled
water
sponged
down
with
disposable
towels
packed
in
scented
alcohol
fed
the
cat
and
myself
and
lay
down
to
sleep
for
about
two
weeks
by
the
third
week
i
was
reasonably
refreshed
and
rested
the
scars
from
my
recent
brushes
with
what
passed
as
the
law
were
healed
i
had
gotten
over
regretting
the
toys
i
left
behind
on
my
island
and
the
money
in
my
banks
in
lima
and
switzerland
and
even
margareta
i
was
headed
for
a
new
world
there
was
no
point
in
dragging
along
old
attachments
the
cat
was
a
godsend
i
began
to
realize
i
named
her
itzenca
after
the
village
where
she
adopted
me
and
i
talked
to
her
by
the
hour
i
always
had
felt
that
there
was
a
subtle
difference
between
talking
to
somebody
else
and
talking
to
yourself
the
latter
gets
a
little
tedious
after
the
first
few
days
but
you
can
keep
the
other
up
indefinitely
so
itz
got
talked
to
plenty
as
we
rode
to
the
stars
say
itz
said
i
where
would
you
like
your
sand
box
situated
right
there
in
front
of
the
tv
screen
there
not
much
traffic
there
since
we
cleared
the
solar
system
you
have
the
place
all
to
yourself
no
said
itzenca
by
a
flirt
of
her
tail
and
she
walked
over
behind
a
crate
that
had
never
been
unloaded
on
earth
i
pulled
out
a
box
of
junk
and
slid
the
sand
box
in
its
place
itzenca
promptly
lost
interest
and
instead
jumped
up
on
the
junk
box
which
fell
off
the
bench
and
scattered
small
objects
of
khaff
and
metal
in
all
directions
come
back
here
blast
you
i
said
and
help
me
pick
up
this
stuff
itz
bounded
after
a
silver
object
that
was
still
rolling
i
was
there
almost
as
quick
as
she
was
and
grabbed
up
the
cylinder
suddenly
the
horsing
around
was
over
this
thing
was
somebody
memory
i
dropped
onto
a
bench
to
examine
it
my
pulse
pounding
where
the
heck
did
this
come
from
cat
i
said
itz
jumped
up
into
my
lap
and
nosed
the
cylinder
i
was
trying
to
hark
back
to
those
days
three
years
before
when
i
had
loaded
the
lifeboat
with
all
the
loot
it
would
carry
for
the
trip
back
to
earth
listen
itz
we
got
to
do
some
tall
remembering
let
see
there
was
a
whole
rack
of
blanks
in
the
section
of
the
room
where
we
found
the
three
skeletons
yeah
now
i
remember
i
pulled
this
one
out
of
the
recorder
set
which
means
it
had
been
used
but
not
yet
i
showed
it
to
foster
when
he
was
hunting
his
own
trace
he
did
realize
i
pulled
it
out
of
the
machine
and
he
thought
it
was
an
empty
but
i
bet
you
somebody
had
his
mind
taped
and
then
left
in
a
hurry
before
the
trace
could
be
and
filed
on
the
other
hand
maybe
it
a
blank
that
had
just
been
inserted
when
somebody
broke
up
the
but
was
there
something
foster
said
about
when
he
woke
up
way
back
when
with
a
pile
of
fresh
corpses
around
him
he
gave
somebody
emergency
treatment
and
to
a
vallonian
that
would
include
a
complete
do
you
realize
what
i
got
here
in
my
hand
itz
she
looked
up
at
me
inquiringly
this
is
what
left
of
the
guy
that
foster
buried
his
pal
ammaerln
i
think
he
called
him
what
inside
this
cylinder
used
to
be
tucked
away
in
the
skull
of
the
ancient
sinner
the
guy
not
so
dead
after
all
i
bet
his
family
will
pay
plenty
for
this
trace
and
be
grateful
besides
that
be
an
ace
in
the
hole
in
case
i
get
too
hungry
on
vallon
i
got
up
and
crossed
the
apartment
itz
followed
me
out
to
my
sleeping
couch
i
dropped
the
trace
in
a
drawer
beside
foster
own
memory
wonder
how
foster
making
out
without
his
past
itz
he
claimed
the
one
i
got
here
would
only
be
a
copy
of
the
original
stored
at
but
my
briefing
did
say
anything
about
copying
memories
he
must
be
somebody
pretty
important
to
rate
that
service
suddenly
my
eyes
were
riveted
to
the
markings
on
foster
trace
lying
in
the
drawer
the
royal
colors
i
sat
down
on
the
bed
with
a
lurch
itzenca
old
gal
it
looks
like
we
be
entering
vallonian
society
from
the
top
we
been
consorting
with
a
member
of
the
vallonian
nobility
during
the
days
that
followed
i
tried
again
and
again
to
raise
foster
on
the
communicator
without
result
i
wondered
how
i
find
him
among
the
millions
on
the
planet
my
best
bet
would
be
to
get
settled
down
in
the
vallonian
environment
then
start
making
a
few
inquiries
i
would
play
it
casually
act
the
part
of
a
vallonian
who
had
merely
been
travelling
for
a
few
hundred
years
which
was
unheard
of
and
play
my
cards
close
to
my
gravy
stains
until
i
learned
what
the
score
was
with
my
vallonian
briefing
i
ought
to
be
able
to
carry
it
off
the
vallonians
might
not
like
illegal
immigrants
any
better
than
they
did
back
home
so
i
keep
my
interesting
foreign
background
to
myself
i
would
need
a
new
name
i
thought
over
several
possibilities
and
selected
drgon
it
was
as
good
a
vallonian
jawbreaker
as
any
i
canvassed
the
emergency
wardrobe
that
was
standard
equipment
on
lifeboats
there
was
everything
from
suits
for
outings
on
worlds
like
pluto
to
sheer
silk
balloon
for
stepping
out
on
venus
in
amongst
them
was
a
selection
of
dresses
reminiscent
of
ancient
greece
they
had
been
the
sharp
style
of
vallon
when
foster
left
home
they
looked
comfortable
i
picked
one
in
a
sober
color
then
got
busy
with
the
cutting
and
seaming
unit
to
fit
it
to
my
frame
i
did
plan
to
attract
unnecessary
attention
with
garments
when
i
crossed
my
first
vallonians
itzenca
watched
with
interest
what
the
heck
am
i
going
to
do
with
you
on
vallon
i
asked
her
the
only
cat
on
the
planet
you
may
have
to
put
up
with
an
iggrfn
for
a
boy
friend
i
said
searching
my
vallonian
memory
they
about
the
nearest
thing
to
you
in
size
and
shape
but
they
kind
of
objectionable
personality
wise
i
finished
off
my
new
duds
then
dug
through
the
handicrafts
gear
and
picked
out
a
sheet
of
khaffite
a
vallonian
alloy
that
was
supposed
to
have
almost
the
durability
of
khaff
without
being
so
hard
to
work
there
were
appropriate
tools
in
the
little
workshop
for
shaping
it
and
adding
decoration
do
worry
i
said
to
itz
you
wo
go
ashore
shabbily
clad
either
you
be
a
knockout
in
this
item
i
parked
her
on
the
workbench
and
sat
down
to
my
tools
i
clipped
out
an
strip
of
the
khaffite
shaped
it
in
a
circle
and
fitted
it
with
a
catch
after
a
leisurely
meal
i
spent
what
passed
for
an
evening
etching
itzenca
on
the
new
collar
with
plenty
of
curlicues
then
i
fitted
it
on
her
she
did
seem
to
mind
a
bit
there
all
set
to
wow
those
vallonians
like
they
never
been
wowed
itzenca
purred
we
strolled
into
the
observation
lounge
strange
star
systems
glowed
far
away
we
be
stepping
out
with
our
memories
any
night
now
i
said
the
proximity
alarms
were
ringing
i
watched
the
screen
with
its
image
of
a
great
green
world
rimmed
on
one
edge
with
glaring
white
from
the
distant
giant
sun
on
the
other
flooded
with
a
cool
glow
reflected
from
the
blue
outer
planet
the
trip
was
almost
over
and
my
confidence
was
beginning
to
fray
around
the
edges
in
a
few
minutes
i
would
be
stepping
into
an
unknown
world
all
set
to
find
my
old
pal
foster
and
see
the
sights
i
did
have
a
passport
but
there
was
no
reason
to
anticipate
trouble
all
i
had
to
do
was
let
my
natural
identity
take
a
back
seat
and
allow
my
vallonian
background
to
do
the
talking
and
yet
now
vallon
spread
out
below
us
a
misty
landscape
bright
under
the
glow
of
the
immense
moonlike
sister
world
cinte
i
had
set
the
landing
monitor
for
the
capital
city
of
vallon
that
was
where
foster
would
have
headed
i
guessed
maybe
i
could
pick
up
the
trail
there
the
city
was
directly
below
a
vast
network
of
avenues
i
had
been
contacted
by
planetary
control
that
was
normal
enough
however
a
small
vessel
coming
in
on
auto
could
handle
itself
a
little
apprehensively
i
ran
over
my
lines
a
last
time
i
was
drgon
citizen
of
the
two
worlds
back
from
a
season
of
and
in
need
of
briefing
rods
to
bring
me
up
to
date
on
developments
at
home
i
also
required
assignment
of
quarters
my
tailoring
was
impeccable
my
command
of
the
language
a
little
rusty
from
long
and
the
only
souvenirs
i
had
to
declare
were
a
tattered
native
costume
from
my
last
port
of
call
a
quaint
weapon
from
the
same
and
a
small
animal
i
had
taken
a
liking
to
the
landing
ring
was
visible
on
the
screen
now
coming
slowly
up
to
meet
us
there
was
a
gentle
shock
and
then
absolute
stillness
i
watched
the
port
cycle
open
i
went
to
it
and
looked
out
at
the
pale
city
stretching
away
to
the
hills
i
took
a
breath
of
the
fragrant
night
air
spiced
with
a
perfume
and
the
part
of
me
that
was
now
vallonian
ached
with
the
inexpressible
emotion
of
homecoming
i
started
to
buckle
on
my
pistol
and
gather
up
a
few
belongings
then
decided
to
wait
until
i
met
the
welcoming
committee
i
whistled
to
itzenca
and
we
stepped
out
and
down
we
crossed
the
clipped
green
luminous
in
the
glow
from
the
lights
over
the
gate
marking
the
path
that
curved
up
toward
the
terraces
above
there
was
no
one
in
sight
bright
cintelight
showed
me
the
gardens
and
walks
and
when
i
reached
the
terraces
the
avenues
beyond
but
no
people
i
stood
by
a
low
wall
of
polished
marble
and
thought
about
it
it
was
about
midnight
and
the
nights
on
vallon
lasted
hours
but
there
should
have
been
some
activity
here
this
was
a
busy
port
scheduled
vessels
private
yachts
official
ships
all
of
them
came
and
went
from
but
not
tonight
the
cat
and
i
walked
across
the
terrace
passed
through
the
open
arch
to
a
refreshment
lounge
the
low
tables
and
cushioned
couches
stood
empty
under
the
rosy
light
from
the
ceiling
panels
my
slippered
feet
whispered
on
the
polished
floor
i
stood
and
listened
dead
silence
there
was
even
the
hum
of
a
mosquito
all
such
insect
pests
had
been
killed
off
long
ago
the
lights
glowed
the
tables
waited
invitingly
how
long
had
they
waited
i
sat
down
at
one
of
them
and
thought
hard
i
had
made
a
lot
of
plans
but
i
had
counted
on
a
deserted
spaceport
how
was
i
going
to
ask
questions
about
foster
if
there
was
no
one
to
ask
i
got
up
and
moved
on
through
the
empty
lounge
past
a
wide
arcade
out
onto
a
terraced
lawn
a
row
of
tall
trees
made
a
dark
wall
beyond
a
still
pool
and
behind
them
distant
towers
loomed
colored
lights
sparkled
a
broad
avenue
swept
in
a
wide
curve
between
fountains
slanted
away
to
the
hills
a
hundred
yards
from
where
i
stood
a
small
vehicle
was
parked
at
the
curb
i
headed
for
it
it
was
an
open
cushioned
finished
in
violet
inlays
against
bright
chrome
i
slid
into
the
seat
looked
over
the
controls
while
itzenca
skipped
to
a
place
beside
me
there
was
a
simple
lever
arrangement
a
steering
tiller
it
looked
easy
i
tried
a
few
pulls
and
pushes
lights
blinked
on
the
panel
the
car
quivered
lifted
a
few
inches
drifted
slowly
across
the
road
i
moved
the
tiller
twiddled
things
the
car
moved
off
toward
the
towers
i
like
the
controls
a
wheel
and
a
couple
of
foot
pedals
would
have
suited
me
better
but
it
beat
walking
two
hours
later
we
had
cruised
the
city
and
found
nothing
it
had
changed
from
what
my
extra
memory
recalled
except
that
all
the
people
were
gone
the
parks
and
boulevards
were
trimmed
the
fountains
and
pools
sparkled
the
lights
glowed
but
nothing
moved
the
automatic
dust
precipitators
and
air
filters
would
run
forever
keeping
things
clean
and
neat
but
there
was
no
one
there
to
appreciate
it
i
pulled
over
sat
watching
the
play
of
colored
lights
on
a
waterfall
and
considered
maybe
i
find
more
of
a
clue
inside
one
of
the
buildings
i
left
the
car
and
picked
one
at
random
a
tall
slab
of
pink
crystal
inside
i
looked
around
at
a
great
airy
cavern
full
of
light
and
listened
to
the
purring
of
the
cat
and
my
own
breathing
there
was
nothing
else
to
hear
i
picked
a
random
corridor
went
along
it
passed
through
empty
rooms
it
was
all
in
the
old
vallonian
style
walls
paneled
in
jade
brocades
hangings
in
iridescent
colors
rugs
like
pools
of
fire
in
one
chamber
i
picked
up
a
cloak
of
and
put
it
over
my
shoulders
i
was
getting
cold
in
my
daytime
street
dress
walking
among
the
tangible
ghosts
of
the
long
past
did
warm
me
up
any
we
climbed
a
wide
spiral
stair
passed
from
vacant
room
to
vacant
room
i
thought
of
the
people
who
had
once
used
them
where
were
they
now
i
found
a
musical
instrument
and
blew
a
few
notes
on
it
it
had
a
deep
mellow
tone
that
echoed
along
the
deserted
corridor
i
thought
it
sounded
a
lot
like
i
felt
sad
and
forgotten
i
went
out
onto
a
lofty
terrace
overlooking
gardens
leaned
on
a
balustrade
and
looked
up
at
the
brilliant
disc
of
cinte
it
loomed
enormous
its
diameter
four
times
that
of
the
earthly
moon
we
come
a
long
way
to
find
nothing
i
said
to
itzenca
she
pushed
her
way
along
my
leg
and
flexed
her
tail
in
a
gesture
meant
to
console
but
it
did
help
after
the
long
wait
the
tension
of
expectation
i
felt
suddenly
as
empty
as
the
silent
halls
of
the
building
i
sat
on
the
balustrade
and
leaned
back
against
the
polished
pink
wall
took
out
the
clarinet
and
blew
some
blue
notes
that
which
once
had
been
was
no
more
remembering
it
i
played
the
for
a
dead
and
felt
a
forlorn
nostalgia
for
a
glory
i
had
never
known
i
finished
and
looked
up
at
a
sound
four
tall
men
in
grey
cloaks
and
a
glitter
of
steel
came
toward
me
from
the
shadows
i
had
dropped
the
clarinet
and
was
on
my
feet
i
tried
to
back
up
but
the
balustrade
stopped
me
the
four
spread
out
the
man
in
the
lead
fingered
a
short
club
and
spoke
to
me
in
gibberish
i
blinked
at
him
and
tried
to
think
of
a
snappy
comeback
he
snapped
his
fingers
and
two
of
the
others
came
up
they
reached
for
my
arms
i
started
to
square
off
fist
cocked
then
relaxed
after
all
i
was
just
a
tourist
drgon
by
name
unfortunately
before
i
could
get
my
fist
back
the
man
with
the
club
swung
it
and
caught
me
across
the
forearm
i
yelled
jumped
back
found
myself
grappled
by
the
others
my
arm
felt
dead
to
the
shoulder
i
tried
a
kick
and
regretted
that
too
there
was
armor
under
the
cloaks
the
club
wielder
said
something
and
pointed
at
the
cat
it
was
time
i
wised
up
i
relaxed
tried
to
coax
my
into
the
foreground
i
listened
to
the
rhythm
of
the
language
it
was
vallonian
badly
warped
by
time
but
i
could
understand
it
musician
would
be
an
owner
one
of
them
said
laughter
whose
man
are
you
piper
what
are
your
colors
i
curled
my
tongue
tried
to
shape
it
around
the
sort
of
syllables
i
heard
them
uttering
it
seemed
to
me
a
gross
debasement
of
the
vallonian
i
knew
still
i
managed
an
answer
i
am
a
citizen
of
vallon
a
dog
of
a
masterless
renegade
the
man
with
the
club
hefted
it
glowered
at
me
and
what
wretched
dialect
is
that
you
speak
i
have
been
long
i
stuttered
i
ask
for
briefing
rods
and
for
a
dwelling
place
a
dwelling
place
you
have
the
man
said
in
the
men
shed
at
he
gestured
and
handcuffs
snapped
on
my
wrists
he
turned
and
stalked
away
and
the
others
hustled
me
after
him
over
my
shoulder
i
got
a
glimpse
of
a
cat
tail
disappearing
over
the
balustrade
outside
a
long
grey
waited
on
the
lawn
they
dumped
me
in
the
back
seat
climbed
aboard
i
got
a
last
look
at
the
spires
of
as
we
tilted
hurtled
away
across
the
low
hills
somewhere
in
the
shuffle
i
had
lost
my
new
cloak
i
shivered
i
listened
to
the
talk
and
what
i
heard
did
make
me
feel
any
better
the
chain
between
my
wrists
kept
up
a
faint
jingling
i
gathered
be
hearing
a
lot
of
that
kind
of
music
from
now
on
i
had
had
an
idealistic
notion
of
wanting
to
fit
into
this
new
world
find
a
place
in
its
society
i
found
a
place
all
right
a
job
with
security
i
was
a
slave
chapter
xiv
it
was
banquet
night
at
and
i
gulped
my
soup
in
the
kitchen
and
ran
over
in
my
mind
the
latest
batch
of
jingles
i
was
expected
to
perform
i
had
only
been
on
the
estate
a
few
weeks
but
i
was
already
owner
gope
favorite
piper
if
i
kept
on
at
this
rate
i
would
soon
have
a
cell
to
myself
in
the
slave
pens
sime
the
pastry
cook
came
over
to
me
pipe
us
a
merry
tune
drgon
he
said
and
i
reward
you
with
a
frosting
pot
with
pleasure
good
sime
i
said
i
finished
off
the
soup
and
got
out
my
clarinet
i
had
tried
out
half
a
dozen
strange
instruments
but
i
still
liked
this
one
best
what
your
pleasure
one
of
the
outland
tunes
you
learned
called
cagu
the
bodyguard
i
complied
with
the
barrel
they
pounded
the
table
and
hallooed
when
i
finished
and
i
got
my
goody
pan
sime
stood
watching
me
scrape
at
it
why
do
you
claim
the
chief
piper
place
drgon
sime
said
you
pipe
rings
around
the
lout
then
you
have
freeman
status
and
could
sit
among
us
in
the
kitchen
almost
as
an
equal
i
went
after
the
last
of
the
chocilla
frosting
licked
my
fingers
and
laid
the
pot
aside
i
gladly
be
the
equal
of
such
a
pastry
cook
as
yourself
good
sime
i
said
but
what
can
a
do
sime
blinked
at
me
you
can
challenge
the
chief
piper
he
said
there
none
can
deny
you
his
master
in
all
but
name
do
fear
the
outcome
of
the
trial
you
triumph
sure
he
glanced
around
at
the
kitchen
staff
is
it
not
so
goodmen
i
warrant
it
the
said
if
you
lose
i
take
your
stripes
for
you
you
going
too
fast
for
me
goodmen
i
said
how
can
i
claim
another
place
sime
waved
his
arms
you
have
long
indeed
piper
drgon
know
you
naught
of
how
the
world
wags
these
days
one
would
take
you
for
a
cintean
heretic
as
i
said
goodmen
in
my
youth
all
men
were
free
and
the
high
king
ruled
at
is
ill
to
speak
of
these
things
said
sime
in
a
low
tone
only
owners
know
their
former
lives
though
i
heard
it
said
that
long
ago
no
man
was
so
mean
but
that
he
recorded
his
lives
and
kept
them
safe
how
you
came
by
yours
i
ask
not
but
do
not
speak
of
it
owner
gope
is
a
jealous
master
though
a
most
generous
and
worshipful
lord
he
added
hastily
looking
around
i
wo
speak
of
it
then
good
sime
i
said
but
i
have
been
long
away
even
the
language
has
changed
so
that
i
wrench
my
tongue
in
the
speaking
of
it
advise
me
if
you
will
sime
puffed
out
his
cheeks
frowning
at
me
i
scarce
know
where
to
start
he
said
all
things
belong
to
the
owners
as
is
only
right
he
looked
around
for
confirmation
the
others
nodded
men
of
low
skill
are
likewise
property
and
is
well
is
so
else
would
they
starve
as
masterless
strays
if
the
greymen
failed
to
find
them
first
he
made
a
sign
and
spat
so
did
everybody
else
now
men
of
good
skill
are
freemen
each
earning
rewards
as
befits
his
ability
i
am
chief
pastry
cook
to
the
lord
gope
with
the
perquisites
of
that
station
therefore
that
none
other
equals
my
talents
he
looked
around
truculently
saw
no
challengers
and
thus
it
is
with
us
all
and
if
some
varlet
claims
the
place
of
any
man
here
put
in
cagu
then
he
got
ta
submit
to
the
trial
then
said
sime
pulling
at
his
apron
agitatedly
this
upstart
pastry
cook
must
cook
against
me
and
all
in
the
hall
will
judge
and
he
who
prevails
is
the
chief
pastry
cook
and
the
other
takes
a
dozen
lashes
for
his
impertinence
but
fear
not
drgon
spoke
cagu
a
chief
piper
ai
but
a
man
only
a
tutor
is
lower
down
among
freemen
and
anyway
the
good
had
promised
to
take
the
lash
for
you
there
was
a
bellow
from
the
door
and
i
grabbed
my
clarinet
and
scrambled
after
the
page
owner
gope
did
like
to
wait
around
for
i
saw
him
looming
up
at
his
place
as
i
darted
through
to
my
assigned
position
within
the
huge
circle
of
the
table
the
chief
piper
had
just
squeezed
his
instrument
and
released
a
windy
blast
of
discordant
sound
he
was
a
lean
creature
fond
of
ordering
the
about
he
pranced
in
an
intricate
pattern
pumping
away
at
his
bladders
until
i
winced
at
the
screech
of
it
owner
gope
noticed
him
about
the
same
time
he
picked
up
a
heavy
brass
mug
and
to
peg
it
at
the
chief
piper
who
saw
it
just
in
time
to
duck
the
mug
hit
a
swollen
a
yellow
one
with
green
tassels
it
burst
with
a
sour
bleat
as
sweet
a
note
as
has
been
played
tonight
roared
owner
gope
begone
lest
you
call
up
the
hill
devils
his
eye
fell
on
me
here
dugon
or
digen
he
cried
now
here
a
true
piper
summon
up
a
fair
melody
dgron
to
clear
the
fumes
of
the
last
performer
from
the
air
before
the
wine
sours
i
bowed
low
wet
my
lips
and
launched
into
the
o
clock
to
judge
from
the
roar
that
went
up
when
i
finished
they
liked
it
i
followed
with
brown
and
of
gope
pounded
and
the
table
quieted
down
the
rarest
slave
in
all
i
swear
it
he
bellowed
were
he
not
a
slave
i
drink
his
health
by
your
leave
owner
i
said
gope
stared
then
nodded
indulgently
speak
then
dugong
he
said
i
claim
the
place
of
chief
piper
i
yells
rang
out
gope
grinned
widely
so
be
it
he
said
shall
the
vote
be
taken
now
or
must
we
submit
to
more
of
the
vile
bladderings
ere
we
proclaim
our
good
dagron
chief
piper
proclaim
him
somebody
shouted
there
must
be
a
trial
another
offered
dubiously
gope
slammed
a
huge
hand
against
the
table
bring
lylk
the
chief
piper
before
me
he
yelled
he
of
the
wretched
the
piper
reappeared
fingering
his
bladders
nervously
the
place
of
the
chief
piper
is
declared
vacant
gope
said
loudly
the
piper
pinched
a
pink
bladder
which
emitted
a
thin
since
the
former
chief
piper
has
been
advanced
in
degree
to
a
new
office
continued
gope
a
blue
bladder
moaned
lost
amid
yells
and
cheers
let
these
be
punctured
gope
cried
i
banish
their
rancid
squeals
forever
from
now
let
all
know
this
former
piper
is
now
chief
fool
to
this
household
let
him
wear
the
broken
bladders
as
a
sign
of
his
office
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
glad
cries
whistles
volunteers
leaped
to
rip
the
colored
they
died
in
a
final
flurry
of
trills
and
flutters
a
tied
the
draggled
instrument
to
the
head
i
gave
them
and
the
former
piper
capered
gingerly
owner
gope
roared
with
laughter
i
followed
with
dipsy
and
the
new
fool
encouraged
by
success
leaped
and
grimaced
pirouetted
strutted
bladders
bobbing
the
crowd
laughed
until
the
tears
flowed
a
great
day
for
gope
shouted
by
the
horns
of
the
i
have
gained
a
prince
of
pipers
and
a
king
of
fools
i
proclaim
them
to
be
men
and
both
shall
have
places
at
table
henceforth
the
fool
and
i
followed
up
with
three
more
numbers
then
gope
let
us
squeeze
into
a
space
on
a
hard
bench
at
the
far
side
of
the
table
a
table
slave
put
loaded
plates
before
us
well
done
good
drgon
he
whispered
do
not
forget
us
slaves
in
your
new
honor
do
worry
i
said
sniffling
the
aroma
of
a
big
slab
of
roast
beef
i
be
sneaking
down
for
a
snack
every
night
about
i
looked
around
the
barbarically
decorated
hall
seeing
things
in
a
new
way
there
nothing
like
a
little
slavery
to
make
a
man
appreciate
even
a
modest
portion
of
freedom
everything
i
had
thought
i
knew
about
vallon
had
been
wrong
the
centuries
that
had
passed
had
changed
things
and
not
for
the
better
the
old
society
that
foster
knew
was
dead
and
buried
the
old
palaces
and
villas
lay
deserted
the
spaceports
unused
and
the
old
system
of
that
foster
described
was
lost
and
forgotten
i
did
know
what
kind
of
a
cataclysm
could
have
plunged
the
seat
of
a
galactic
empire
back
into
feudal
darkness
but
it
had
happened
so
far
i
had
found
a
trace
of
foster
my
questions
had
gotten
me
nothing
but
blank
stares
maybe
foster
had
made
it
there
could
have
been
an
accident
in
space
or
perhaps
he
was
somewhere
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
world
vallon
was
a
big
planet
and
communications
were
poor
maybe
foster
was
dead
i
could
live
out
a
long
life
here
and
never
find
the
answers
i
remembered
my
own
disappointment
at
the
breakdown
of
my
illusions
that
night
at
how
much
more
heartbreaking
must
have
been
foster
experience
when
and
if
he
had
arrived
back
here
and
now
we
were
both
in
the
same
boat
with
our
memories
of
the
old
vallon
and
the
dreary
spectacle
of
the
new
providing
plenty
of
food
for
bitterness
and
foster
memory
that
i
had
been
bringing
him
for
a
keepsake
what
a
laugh
that
was
far
from
being
a
superfluous
duplicate
of
a
master
trace
to
which
he
had
expected
easy
access
my
copy
of
the
trace
was
now
with
the
vaults
at
sealed
and
forbidden
of
the
greatest
possible
importance
to
foster
and
there
was
a
machine
left
on
the
planet
to
play
it
on
well
i
still
meant
to
find
foster
if
it
took
me
owner
gope
was
humming
loudly
and
tunelessly
to
himself
i
knew
the
sign
i
got
ready
to
play
again
being
chief
piper
probably
going
to
be
just
one
big
bowl
of
cherries
but
at
least
i
was
a
slave
now
i
had
a
long
way
to
go
but
i
was
making
progress
owner
gope
and
i
got
along
well
he
was
a
shrewd
old
duck
and
he
liked
having
such
an
unusual
piper
on
hand
he
had
heard
from
the
greymen
the
police
force
how
i
had
landed
at
the
deserted
port
he
warned
me
in
an
oblique
way
not
to
let
word
get
out
that
i
knew
anything
about
old
times
in
vallon
the
whole
subject
was
tabu
especially
the
old
capital
city
and
the
royal
palaces
themselves
small
wonder
that
my
trespassing
there
had
brought
the
greymen
down
on
me
in
doublequick
time
gope
took
me
with
him
everywhere
he
went
by
or
formal
river
barge
there
were
still
a
lot
of
vehicles
around
though
few
people
seemed
to
know
how
to
use
them
simple
as
they
were
to
operate
the
were
more
useful
since
they
required
no
roads
but
gope
preferred
the
ground
cars
i
think
he
liked
the
sensation
of
speed
you
got
barrelling
along
a
ninety
or
a
hundred
on
one
of
the
roads
that
had
originally
been
intended
merely
as
scenic
drives
one
afternoon
several
months
after
my
promotion
i
dropped
in
at
the
kitchen
i
was
due
to
shove
off
with
owner
gope
and
his
usual
retinue
for
a
visit
to
a
big
estate
a
hundred
miles
north
of
in
the
direction
of
sime
and
my
other
old
cronies
fixed
me
up
with
a
healthy
lunch
and
warned
me
that
it
would
be
a
rough
trip
the
stretch
of
road
we
be
using
was
a
favorite
of
road
pirates
what
i
do
understand
i
said
is
why
gope
does
mount
a
couple
of
guns
on
the
car
and
blast
his
way
through
the
raiders
every
time
he
goes
off
the
estate
he
taking
his
life
in
his
hands
the
boys
were
shocked
even
piratical
renegades
would
never
dream
of
taking
a
man
life
good
drgon
sime
said
every
owner
far
and
near
would
band
together
to
hunt
such
miscreants
down
and
their
own
fellows
would
abet
the
hunters
nay
none
is
so
low
as
to
steal
all
a
man
lives
the
corsairs
themselves
know
full
well
that
in
their
next
life
they
may
be
simple
goodmen
even
slaves
the
chief
put
in
for
you
know
good
drgon
that
when
a
member
of
a
pirate
band
suffers
the
change
the
others
lead
the
newman
to
an
estate
that
he
may
find
his
place
how
often
do
these
changes
come
along
i
asked
it
varies
greatly
some
men
of
great
strength
and
moral
power
have
been
known
to
go
on
unchanged
for
three
or
four
hundred
years
but
the
ordinary
man
lives
a
life
of
eighty
to
one
hundred
years
sime
paused
or
it
may
be
less
a
life
of
travail
and
strife
can
age
one
sooner
than
one
of
peace
and
retirement
or
unusual
vicissitudes
can
shorten
a
life
remarkably
a
cousin
of
mine
who
was
marooned
on
the
great
stony
place
in
the
southern
and
who
wandered
for
three
weeks
without
more
to
eat
or
drink
than
a
small
bag
of
wine
underwent
the
change
after
only
fourteen
years
when
he
was
found
his
face
was
lined
and
his
hair
had
greyed
in
the
way
that
presages
the
change
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
fell
in
a
fit
as
one
does
and
slept
for
a
night
and
a
day
when
he
awoke
he
was
a
newman
young
and
knowing
nothing
did
you
tell
him
who
he
was
nay
sime
lowered
his
voice
you
are
much
favored
of
owner
gope
good
drgon
and
rightly
still
there
are
matters
a
man
talks
not
of
a
newman
takes
a
name
and
sets
out
to
learn
whatever
trade
he
can
put
in
the
carver
of
roasts
by
his
own
skills
he
can
rise
as
you
have
risen
good
drgon
do
you
have
memory
machines
or
briefing
rods
i
persisted
little
black
sticks
you
touch
them
to
your
head
and
sime
made
a
motion
in
the
air
i
have
heard
of
these
wands
a
forbidden
relic
of
the
black
arts
nuts
i
said
you
do
believe
in
magic
do
you
sime
the
rods
are
nothing
but
a
scientific
development
by
your
own
people
how
managed
to
lose
all
knowledge
of
your
own
past
sime
raised
his
hands
in
distress
good
drgon
press
us
not
in
these
matters
such
things
are
forbidden
okay
boys
i
guess
i
just
nosy
i
went
on
out
to
the
car
and
climbed
in
to
wait
for
owner
gope
trying
to
learn
anything
about
vallon
history
was
about
like
questioning
a
village
of
eskimos
about
the
great
trek
over
from
asia
they
know
anything
i
had
reached
a
few
tentative
conclusions
on
my
own
however
my
theory
was
that
some
sudden
social
cataclysm
had
broken
down
the
system
of
personality
reinforcement
and
memory
recording
that
had
given
continuity
to
the
culture
vallonian
society
based
as
it
was
on
the
techniques
of
memory
preservation
had
gradually
disintegrated
vallon
was
plunged
into
a
feudal
state
resembling
its
ancient
social
pattern
of
fifty
thousand
years
earlier
prior
to
the
development
of
memory
recording
the
people
huddled
together
on
estates
for
protection
from
real
or
imagined
perils
and
shunning
the
old
villas
and
cities
as
tabu
except
for
those
included
in
estates
knew
nothing
of
space
travel
and
ancient
history
like
sime
they
had
no
wish
even
to
speak
of
such
matters
i
might
have
better
luck
with
my
detective
work
on
a
big
estate
like
i
was
looking
forward
to
today
trip
i
was
cramped
on
it
was
a
small
poor
estate
covering
only
about
twenty
square
miles
with
half
a
dozen
villages
of
farmers
and
craftsmen
and
the
big
house
of
owner
gope
i
had
seen
all
of
it
and
it
was
a
dead
end
gope
appeared
with
cagu
and
two
other
bodyguards
four
dancing
girls
and
an
gift
hamper
they
took
their
places
and
the
driver
started
up
and
wheeled
the
heavy
car
out
onto
the
highroad
i
felt
a
pulse
of
excitement
as
we
accelerated
in
the
direction
of
maybe
at
the
big
estate
i
get
news
of
foster
we
were
doing
about
fifty
down
a
winding
mountain
road
i
was
in
the
front
seat
beside
the
driver
fiddling
with
my
clarinet
and
watching
the
road
from
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
was
wishing
the
driver
knuckles
did
show
white
on
the
speed
control
lever
he
drove
like
a
drunken
spinster
fast
but
nervous
it
was
entirely
his
fault
gope
insisted
on
plenty
of
speed
i
was
grateful
for
the
auto
steer
mechanism
at
least
we
could
drive
over
a
cliff
we
rounded
a
curve
the
wheels
screeching
from
the
driver
awkward
swing
into
the
turn
and
saw
another
car
in
the
road
a
quarter
of
a
mile
ahead
not
moving
but
parked
sideways
the
driver
hit
the
brakes
behind
us
owner
gope
yelled
pirates
do
slacken
your
pace
driver
but
but
owner
gope
the
driver
gasped
ram
the
blackguards
if
you
must
gope
shouted
but
do
stop
the
girls
in
the
back
yelped
in
alarm
the
flunkies
set
up
a
wail
the
driver
rolled
his
eyes
almost
lost
control
then
gritted
his
teeth
reached
out
to
switch
off
the
circuit
and
slam
the
speed
control
lever
against
the
dash
i
watched
for
two
long
heartbeats
as
we
roared
straight
for
the
blockading
car
then
i
slid
over
and
grabbed
for
the
controls
the
driver
held
on
frozen
i
reared
back
and
clipped
him
on
the
jaw
he
crumpled
into
his
corner
mouth
open
and
eyes
screwed
shut
as
i
hit
the
override
and
worked
the
tiller
it
was
an
awkward
position
for
steering
but
i
preferred
it
to
hammering
in
at
ninety
per
the
car
ahead
was
still
sitting
tight
now
a
hundred
yards
away
now
fifty
i
cut
hard
to
the
right
toward
the
rising
cliff
face
the
car
backed
to
block
me
at
the
last
instant
i
whipped
to
the
left
barreled
past
with
half
an
inch
to
spare
rocketed
along
the
ragged
edge
with
the
left
wheel
rolling
on
air
then
whipped
back
into
the
center
of
the
road
well
done
yelled
cagu
but
they
give
chase
gope
shouted
assassins
masterless
swine
the
driver
had
his
eyes
open
now
crawl
over
me
i
barked
he
mumbled
and
clambered
past
me
and
i
slid
into
his
seat
still
clinging
to
the
accelerator
lever
and
putting
up
the
speed
another
curve
was
coming
up
i
grabbed
a
quick
look
in
the
the
pirates
were
swinging
around
to
follow
us
press
on
commanded
gope
we
close
to
it
no
more
than
five
miles
what
kind
of
speed
have
they
got
i
called
back
they
beat
us
easy
said
cagu
cheerfully
what
the
road
like
ahead
a
fair
road
straight
and
true
now
that
we
descended
the
mountain
answered
gope
we
squealed
through
the
turn
and
hit
a
straightaway
a
curving
road
branched
off
ahead
what
that
i
snapped
a
winding
trail
gasped
the
driver
it
comes
on
but
by
a
longer
way
i
gauged
my
speed
braked
minutely
and
cut
hard
we
howled
up
the
steep
slope
into
a
turn
between
hills
gope
shouted
what
madness
is
this
are
you
in
league
with
the
villains
we
have
got
a
chance
on
the
straightaway
i
called
back
not
in
a
straight
speed
contest
i
whipped
the
tiller
over
then
back
the
other
way
following
the
tight
we
flashed
past
magnificent
vistas
of
rugged
peaks
and
rolling
plains
but
i
did
have
time
to
admire
the
view
there
were
squeals
from
the
odalisques
in
the
rear
seats
a
gabble
of
excited
talk
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
our
pursuers
just
heading
into
the
side
road
behind
us
any
way
they
can
head
us
off
i
yelled
not
unless
they
have
confederates
stationed
ahead
said
gope
but
these
pariahs
work
alone
i
worked
the
brake
and
speed
levers
handled
the
tiller
we
swung
right
then
left
higher
and
higher
then
down
a
steep
grade
and
up
again
the
pirate
car
rounded
a
turn
only
a
few
hundred
yards
behind
now
i
scanned
the
road
ahead
followed
its
winding
course
along
the
mountainside
through
a
tunnel
then
out
again
to
swing
around
the
shoulder
of
the
next
peak
pitch
something
out
when
we
go
through
the
tunnel
i
yelled
anything
my
cloak
cried
gope
and
the
gift
hamper
one
of
the
flunkies
started
to
moan
the
girls
caught
the
fever
joined
in
with
shrill
lamentations
silence
roared
gope
lend
a
hand
here
or
by
the
beard
you
be
jettisoned
with
the
rest
we
roared
into
the
tunnel
mouth
there
was
a
blast
of
air
as
the
rear
deck
cover
opened
gope
and
cagu
hefted
the
heavy
gift
hamper
tumbled
it
out
followed
it
with
a
cloak
a
wine
jug
assorted
sandals
bracelets
fruit
then
we
were
back
in
the
sunlight
and
i
was
fighting
the
curve
in
the
i
saw
the
pirates
burst
from
the
tunnel
mouth
gope
black
and
yellow
cloak
spread
over
the
canopy
smashed
fruit
spattered
over
it
the
remains
of
the
hamper
dragging
under
the
chassis
the
car
rocked
and
a
corner
of
the
cloak
lifted
clearing
the
driver
view
barely
in
time
tough
luck
i
said
we
got
a
long
straight
stretch
ahead
and
fresh
out
of
ideas
the
other
car
gained
i
held
the
speed
bar
against
the
dash
but
we
were
up
against
a
faster
car
it
was
a
hundred
yards
behind
us
then
fifty
then
pulling
out
to
go
alongside
i
slowed
imperceptibly
let
him
get
his
front
wheels
past
us
then
cut
sharply
there
was
a
clash
of
wheel
fairings
and
i
fought
the
tiller
as
we
rebounded
from
the
heavier
car
he
crept
forward
almost
alongside
again
shoulder
to
shoulder
we
raced
at
down
the
steep
grade
i
hit
the
brakes
and
cut
hard
to
the
left
slapped
his
right
rear
wheel
slid
back
he
braked
too
that
was
a
mistake
the
heavy
car
lost
traction
sliding
in
slow
motion
in
a
skid
it
rose
on
its
nose
ploughing
up
a
cloud
of
dust
the
hamper
whirled
away
the
cloak
fluttered
and
was
gone
then
the
pirate
car
seemed
to
float
for
an
instant
in
air
before
it
dropped
wheels
up
out
of
sight
over
the
sheer
cliff
we
raced
alone
down
the
slope
and
out
onto
the
wooded
plain
toward
the
towers
of
a
shout
went
up
owner
gope
leaned
forward
to
pound
my
back
by
the
nine
eyes
of
the
hill
devil
he
bellowed
masterfully
executed
the
prince
of
pipers
is
a
prince
of
drivers
too
this
night
sit
by
my
side
at
the
at
in
the
rank
of
a
chief
driver
i
swear
it
compared
with
making
a
left
turn
off
the
outer
drive
at
on
a
friday
that
was
nothing
i
said
i
held
onto
the
tiller
and
tried
breathing
again
i
been
a
fool
to
try
to
flip
a
heavier
car
but
it
had
worked
and
now
i
gotten
another
promotion
i
was
doing
okay
and
let
no
man
raise
a
charge
of
assassination
gope
went
on
not
see
so
clever
a
immured
i
charge
you
all
say
nothing
of
this
we
consider
that
the
rascals
merely
outdid
themselves
in
their
villainy
that
was
the
first
i
thought
of
that
angle
to
take
a
human
life
was
still
the
one
unthinkable
crime
in
this
world
of
immortals
because
you
took
not
just
one
but
all
a
man
lives
the
punishment
was
walling
up
for
life
but
just
one
life
in
my
case
one
would
be
enough
i
did
have
any
spares
i
had
taken
a
bigger
chance
with
gope
than
i
had
with
the
pirates
life
here
was
a
series
of
gambles
but
it
looked
like
the
got
ahead
fast
my
best
bet
was
to
stay
on
the
make
and
calculate
the
odds
when
it
was
over
i
spent
the
first
day
at
the
tall
buildings
and
keeping
an
eye
open
for
foster
on
the
off
chance
that
i
might
pass
him
on
the
street
it
was
about
as
likely
as
running
into
an
old
high
school
chum
from
perth
amboy
among
the
body
servants
of
the
shah
of
afghanistan
but
i
kept
looking
by
sunset
i
was
no
wiser
than
before
dressed
in
the
latest
in
vallonian
cape
and
ruffles
i
was
sitting
with
my
buddy
cagu
chief
bodyguard
to
owner
gope
at
a
small
table
on
the
first
terrace
at
the
palace
of
merrymaking
biggest
community
feasting
hall
it
looked
like
a
hollywood
producer
idea
of
a
century
night
club
complete
with
nine
dance
floors
on
five
levels
indoor
pools
fountains
two
thousand
tables
musicians
girls
noise
colored
lights
and
food
fit
for
an
owner
it
was
open
to
all
goodmen
of
the
estate
and
to
guests
of
equivalent
rank
after
the
life
at
it
looked
like
the
big
time
to
me
cagu
was
a
old
cuss
but
his
face
was
cut
and
scarred
from
a
thousand
encounters
with
other
bodyguards
and
his
nose
had
been
broken
so
often
that
it
was
invisible
in
profile
where
do
you
manage
to
get
in
all
the
fights
cagu
i
asked
him
i
known
you
for
three
months
and
i
have
seen
a
blow
struck
in
anger
yet
here
he
grinned
showing
me
some
broken
front
teeth

picked
up
my
drink

it
to
cagu
and
got
it
in
my
lap
as
somebody
jostled
my
arm
i
looked
up
a
thug

over
me
punk
cagu
he
said
in
a
hoarse
whisper
he
probed
at
a
back
tooth
with
a
silver
pick
rolled
his
eyes
from
me
to
my
partner
cagu
stood
up
and
threw
a
punch
to
the
other
paunch
he
clinched

over
cagu

him

of
the
guys
he
signaled
a
passing
bring
my
friend
a
new
suit

it
snappy
do
the
customers
kind
of
resent
it
when
you
birds
stage
a
heavyweight
bout
in
the
aisle
i
asked
a
drink
in
the
lap
is
routine
it
could
happen
in
any
joint
in
manhattan
but
a
meal
would
be
overdoing
it
nah
we
move
down
inta
the
spot
he
waved
a
thumb
in
the
general
direction
of
somewhere
else
he
looked

over
where

first
time
ina
palace

cagu
and
mull
swapped
lies
while
i
worked
on
my
drinking
although
i
had
learned
anything
on
my
day
looking
around
at
it
was
still
a
better
spot
for
snooping
than
there
were
two
major
cities
on
the
estate
and
scores
of
villages
somewhere
among
the
population
i
might
have
better
luck
finding
someone
to
talk
history
with
or
someone
who
knew
foster
hey
growled
mull
look
who
comin
i
followed
his
gaze
three
thugs
swaggered
up
to
the
table
one
of
them
a
gorilla
at
least
seven
feet
tall
reached
out
took
cagu
and
mull
by
the
backs
of
their
necks
and
cracked
their
skulls
together
i
jumped
up
ducked
a
fist
and
saw
a
beautiful
burst
of
fireworks
followed
by
soothing
darkness
i
fumbled
in
the
dark
with
the
lengths
of
cloth
entangling
my
legs
sat
up
cracked
my
head
i
groaned
freed
a
leg
from
the
chair
rungs
groped
my
way
out
from
under
the
table
a
helped
me
up
dusted
me
off
the
lout
lolling
in
a
chair
glanced
my
way
nodded
you
should
hang
out
with
lugs
like
that
mull
he
said
cagu
told
me
you
was
just
a
piper
but
the
way
you
come
outa
that
chair
he
shrugged
turned
back
to
whatever
he
was
watching
i
checked
a
few
elbow
and
knee
joints
worked
my
jaw
tried
my
neck
all
okay
you
the
one
that
slugged
me
i
asked
huh
yeah
i
stepped
over
to
his
chair
picked
a
spot
and
cleared
my
throat
hey
you
i
said
he
turned
and
i
put
everything
i
had
behind
a
straight
right
to
the
point
of
the
jaw
he
went
over
feet
in
the
air
flipped
a
rail
and
crashed
down
between
two
tables
below
i
leaned
over
the
rail
a
party
of
indignant
stared
up
at
me
sorry
folks
i
said
he
slipped
a
shout
went
up
from
the
floor
some
distance
away
i
looked
in
a
cleared
circle
two
levels
below
a
pair
of
men
were
slugging
it
out
one
of
them
was
cagu
i
watched
saw
his
opponent
fall
another
man
stepped
in
to
take
his
place
i
turned
and
made
my
way
down
to
the
cagu
exchanged
haymakers
with
two
more
opponents
before
he
folded
and
was
hauled
from
the
ring
i
propped
him
up
in
a
chair
fitted
a
drink
into
his
fist
and
watched
the
boys
pound
each
other
it
was
easy
to
see
why
the
scarred
face
was
the
sign
of
their
craft
there
was
no
defensive
fighting
whatever
they
stood
and
hit
as
hard
as
they
could
until
one
collapsed
it
was
fancy
but
the
fans
loved
it
cagu
came
to
after
a
while
and
filled
me
in
on
the
backgrounds
so
they
all
top
boys
he
said
but
it
ai
like
in
the
old
days
when
i
was
in
my
prime
i
could
took
any
three
of
these
bums
the
only
one
maybe
i
woulda
had
a
little
trouble
with
is
torbu
which
one
is
he
he
ai
down
there
yet
he
show
to
take
on
the
last
boys
on
their
feet
more
gladiators
pushed
their
way
to
the
spot
pulled
off
cloaks
and
weskits
and
waded
in
others
folded
were
dragged
clear
revived
to
down
another
and
shot
cheer
on
the
fray
after
an
hour
the
waiting
line
had
dwindled
away
to
nothing
the
two
battlers
on
the
spot
slugged
clinched
breathed
hard
swung
and
missed
the
crowd
booed
where
torbu
cagu
wondered
maybe
he
did
come
tonight
i
said
sure
you
met
him
he
knocked
you
under
the
table
oh
him
where
he
go
the
last
i
saw
he
was
asleep
on
the
floor
i
said
hozzat
i
did
much
like
him
slugging
me
i
clobbered
him
one
hey
yelped
cagu
his
face
lit
up
he
got
to
his
feet
hold
it
i
said
what
cagu
pushed
his
way
through
to
the
spot
took
aim
and
floored
the
closest
fighter
turned
and
laid
out
the
other
he
raised
both
hands
above
his
head
got
ta
champion
he
bellowed
takes
on
all
comers
he
turned
waved
to
me
our
boy
drgon
he
there

haymaker

to
me

and
slammed
a
roundhouse
right
to
the
side
of
cagu
jaw
the
old
fighter
hit
the
floor
hard
skidded
lay
still
i
got
to
my
feet
they
pulled
him
to
the
nearest
table
hoisted
him
into
a
chair
i
made
my
way
down
to
the
little
clearing
in
the
crowd
a
man
bending
over
cagu
straightened
face
white
i
pushed
him
aside
grabbed
the
bodyguard
wrist
there
was
no
pulse
cagu
was
dead
torbu
stood
in
the
center
of
the
spot
mouth
open
what
he
started
i
pushed
between
two
fans
went
for
him
he
saw
me
crouched
swung
i
ducked
uppercut
him
he
staggered
back
i
pressed
him
threw
lefts
and
rights
to
the
body
ducked
under
his
wild
swings
then
rocked
his
head
left
and
right
he
stood
knees
together
eyes
glazed
hands
down
i
measured
him
his
jaw
he
dropped
like
a
log
panting
i
looked
across
at
cagu
his
scarred
face
white
as
wax
was
strangely
altered
now
it
looked
peaceful
somebody
helped
torbu
to
his
feet
walked
him
to
the
it
had
been
a
big
evening
now
all
i
had
to
do
was
take
the
body
home
i
went
over
to
where
cagu
was
laid
out
on
the
floor
shocked
people
stood
staring
torbu
was
beside
the
body
a
tear
ran
down
his
nose
dripped
on
cagu
face
torbu
wiped
it
away
with
a
big
scarred
hand
i
sorry
old
friend
he
said
i
did
mean
it
i
picked
cagu
up
and
got
him
over
my
shoulder
and
all
the
way
to
the
far
exit
it
was
so
quiet
in
the
palace
of
merrymaking
that
i
could
hear
my
own
heavy
breathing
and
the
tinkle
of
fountains
and
the
squeak
of
my
fancy
yellow
plastic
shoes
in
the
bodyguards
quarters
i
laid
cagu
out
on
a
bunk
then
faced
the
dozen
scowling
bruisers
who
stared
down
at
the
still
body
cagu
was
a
good
man
i
said
now
he
dead
he
died
like
an
animal
for
nothing
that
ended
all
his
lives

good
time
will
come
back
too
what
the
rthr
i
said
kinda
like
a
owner
there
ai
no
rthr
now
but
a
long
time
ago
back
when
our
first
lives
started
there
was
a
rthr
that
was
owner
of
all
vallon
and
everybody
lived
high
and
had
all
their
lives
torbu
stopped
eyed
me
warily
do
say
nothing
to
nobody
he
went
on
about
what
i
been
you
that
a
secret
of
the
brotherhood
but
it
kind
of
like
a
hope
we
got
that
what
we
waitin
for
through
all
our
lives
we
got
to
do
the
best
we
can
and
keep
true
to
the
code
and
the
brotherhood
and
someday
the
rthr
will
come
back
maybe
okay
i
said
dream
on
big
boy
and
while
you
treasuring
your
rosy
dreams
you
get
your
brains
kicked
out
like
cagu
i
turned
away
listen
drgon
it
no
good
buckin
the
system
it
too
big
for
one
guy
or
even
a
bunch
of
guys
but
i
looked
up
yeah
if
you
got
ta
stick
your
neck
out
see
owner
gope
abruptly
torbu
turned
and
pushed
back
through
the
door
see
owner
gope
huh
okay
what
did
i
have
to
lose
i
headed
back
along
the
corridor
toward
owners
country
i
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
carpet
in
gope
suite
trying
to
keep
my
temper
hot
enough
to
supply
the
gall
i
needed
to
bust
in
on
an
owner
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
sat
in
his
ceremonial
chair
and
stared
at
me
impassively
with
your
help
or
without
it
i
said
i
going
to
find
the
answers
yes
good
drgon
he
said
not
bellowing
for
once
i
understand
but
there
are
matters
you
know
not
of
just
get
me
back
into
the
spaceport
noble
gope
i
have
enough
briefing
rods
aboard
to
prove
my
point
and
a
few
other
little
items
to
boot
it
forbidden
do
you
not
understand
i
understand
too
much
i
snapped
he
straightened
eyed
me
with
a
touch
of
the
old
ferocity
mind
your
tone
drgon
i
owner
i
broke
in
do
you
remember
cagu
maybe
you
remember
him
as
a
newman
young
handsome
like
a
god
out
of
some
old
legend
you
seen
him
live
his
life
was
it
a
good
life
did
the
promise
of
youth
ever
get
paid
off
gope
closed
his
eyes
stop
he
said
this
is
bad
bad
the
deaths
they
died
i
have
watched
beside
and
the
lives
they
led
were
mine
i
quoted
are
you
proud
of
them
and
what
about
yourself
do
you
ever
wonder
what
you
might
have
been
back
in
the
good
time
who
are
you
asked
gope
his
eyes
fixed
on
mine
you
speak
old
vallonian
you
rake
up
the
forbidden
knowledge
and
challenge
the
very
powers
he
got
to
his
feet
i
could
have
you
immured
drgon
i
could
hand
you
to
the
greymen
for
a
fate
i
shudder
to
name
he
turned
and
walked
the
length
of
the
room
restlessly
then
turned
back
to
me
and
stopped
matters
stand
ill
with
this
fair
world
he
said
legend
tells
us
that
once
men
lived
as
the
high
gods
on
vallon
there
was
a
mighty
owner
rthr
of
all
vallon
it
is
whispered
that
he
will
come
again
your
legends
are
all
true
you
can
take
my
word
for
that
but
that
does
mean
some
supernatural
sugar
daddy
is
going
to
come
along
and
bail
you
out
and
do
get
the
idea
i
think
i
the
fabled
answer
to
prayers
all
i
mean
is
that
once
upon
a
time
vallon
was
a
good
place
to
live
and
it
could
be
again
right
now
it
like
a
land
under
an
enchantment
and
you
sleeping
beauties
need
waking
up
your
cities
and
roads
and
ships
are
still
here
intact
but
nobody
knows
how
to
run
them
and
you
all
afraid
to
try
who
scared
you
off
who
started
the
rumors
what
broke
down
the
memory
recording
system
why
ca
we
all
go
to
and
use
the
archives
to
give
everybody
back
what
he
lost
these
are
dread
words
said
gope
there
must
be
somebody
behind
it
or
there
was
once
who
is
he
gope
thought
there
is
one
man
among
us
the
great
owner
owner
of
owners
ommodurad
by
name
where
he
dwells
i
know
not
this
is
a
secret
possessed
only
by
his
intimates
what
does
he
look
like
how
do
i
get
to
see
him
gope
shook
his
head
i
have
seen
him
but
once
closely
cowled
he
is
a
tall
man
and
silent
is
said
gope
lowered
his
voice
by
his
black
arts
he
possesses
all
his
lives
an
aura
of
dread
hangs
about
him
never
mind
that
jazz
i
said
he
a
man
like
other
men
stick
a
knife
between
his
ribs
and
you
put
an
end
to
him
aura
and
all
i
do
not
like
this
talk
of
death
let
the
doer
of
evil
deeds
be
immured
it
is
sufficient
first
let
find
him
how
can
i
get
close
to
him
there
are
those
owners
who
are
his
confidants
said
gope
his
trusted
agents
it
is
through
them
that
we
small
owners
learn
of
his
will
can
we
enlist
one
of
them
never
they
are
bound
to
him
by
ties
of
darkness
spells
and
incantations
i
a
fast
man
with
a
pair
of
loaded
dice
myself
it
all
done
with
mirrors
let
stick
to
the
point
noble
gope
how
can
i
work
into
a
spot
with
one
of
these
big
shots
nothing
easier
a
driver
and
piper
of
such
skills
as
your
own
can
claim
what
place
he
chooses
how
about
bodyguarding
suppose
i
could
take
a
heavy
named
torbu
would
that
set
me
in
better
with
a
new
owner
such
is
no
place
for
a
man
of
your
abilities
good
drgon
gope
exclaimed
true
is
a
place
most
close
to
an
owner
but
there
is
much
danger
in
it
the
challenge
to
a
bodyguard
involves
the
most
bloody
combat
second
only
to
the
rigors
of
a
challenge
to
an
owner
himself
what
that
i
snapped
challenge
an
owner
be
calm
good
drgon
said
gope
staring
at
me
incredulously
no
common
man
with
his
wits
about
him
will
challenge
an
owner
but
i
could
if
i
wanted
to
in
sooth
if
you
have
tired
of
life
of
all
your
lives
is
as
good
a
way
to
end
them
as
another
but
you
must
know
good
drgon
an
owner
is
a
warrior
trained
in
the
skills
of
battle
none
less
than
another
such
may
hope
to
prevail
i
smacked
my
fist
into
my
palm
i
should
have
thought
of
this
sooner
the
cooks
cook
for
their
places
the
pipers
pipe
and
the
best
man
wins
it
figures
that
the
owners
would
use
the
same
system
but
the
procedure
noble
gope
how
do
you
get
your
chance
to
prove
who
can
own
the
best
it
is
a
contest
with
naked
steel
it
is
the
measure
and
glory
of
an
owner
that
he
alone
stands
ready
to
prove
his
quality
against
the
peril
of
death
itself
gope
drew
himself
up
with
pride
what
about
the
bodyguards
i
asked
they
fight
with
their
hands
good
drgon
and
they
lack
skill
with
those
a
death
such
as
you
described
tonight
that
is
a
rare
and
sorry
accident
it
showed
up
this
whole
grubby
farce
in
its
true
colors
a
civilization
like
that
of
vallon
reduced
to
this
still
it
is
sweet
to
live
by
whatever
rules
i
do
believe
that
and
neither
do
you
what
owner
can
i
challenge
how
do
i
go
about
it
give
up
this
course
good
drgon
where
the
nearest
buddy
of
the
big
owner
gope
threw
up
his
hands
here
at
owner
qohey
but
and
how
do
i
call
his
bluff
gope
put
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
it
is
no
bluff
good
drgon
it
is
long
now
since
last
owner
qohey
stood
to
his
blade
to
protect
his
place
but
you
may
be
sure
he
has
lost
none
of
his
skill
thus
it
was
he
won
his
way
to
while
lesser
knights
such
as
myself
contented
themselves
with
meaner
fiefs
i
not
bluffing
either
noble
gope
i
said
stretching
a
point
i
was
no
in
the
good
time
it
is
your
death
tell
me
how
i
offer
the
challenge
or
i
twist
his
nose
in
the
main
banqueting
salon
tomorrow
night
gope
sat
down
heavily
raised
his
hand
and
let
them
fall
if
i
tell
you
not
another
will
but
i
will
not
soon
find
another
piper
of
your
worth
chapter
xv
gaudy
hangings
of
purple
cut
the
light
of
the
sun
to
a
rich
gloom
in
the
enormous
audience
hall
a
rustling
murmur
was
audible
in
the
room
as
uneasy
courtiers
and
supplicants
fidgeted
waiting
for
the
appearance
of
the
owner
it
had
been
two
months
since
gope
had
explained
to
me
how
a
formal
challenge
to
an
owner
was
conducted
and
as
he
pointed
out
this
was
the
only
kind
of
challenge
that
would
help
if
i
waylaid
the
man
and
cut
him
down
even
in
a
fair
fight
his
bodyguards
would
repay
the
favor
before
i
could
establish
the
claim
that
i
was
their
legitimate
new
boss
i
had
spent
three
hours
every
day
in
the
armory
at
trading
buffets
with
gope
and
a
couple
of
the
bodyguards
the
slab
of
edged
steel
had
felt
right
at
home
in
my
hand
that
first
day
for
about
a
minute
i
had
the
borrowed
knowledge
to
give
me
all
the
technique
i
needed
but
the
muscle
power
for
putting
the
knowledge
into
practice
was
another
matter
after
five
minutes
i
was
slumped
against
the
wall
gulping
air
while
gope
whistled
his
sticker
around
my
head
and
talked
you
laid
on
like
no
piper
good
drgon
yet
have
you
much
to
learn
in
the
matter
of
endurance
and
he
was
at
me
again
i
spent
the
afternoon
and
making
wild
swings
and
finally
fell
down
pooped
i
have
moved
if
gope
had
had
at
me
with
a
hot
poker
gope
and
the
others
laughed
til
they
cried
then
hauled
me
away
to
my
room
and
let
me
sleep
they
rolled
me
out
the
next
morning
to
go
at
it
again
as
gope
said
there
was
no
time
to
waste
and
after
two
months
of
it
i
felt
ready
for
anything
gope
had
warned
me
that
owner
qohey
was
a
big
fellow
but
that
did
bother
me
the
bigger
they
came
the
bigger
the
target
there
was
a
murmur
in
a
different
key
in
the
audience
hall
and
tall
gilt
doors
opened
at
the
far
side
of
the
room
a
couple
of
liveried
flunkies
scampered
into
view
then
a
stalked
into
the
hall
made
his
way
to
the
dias
turned
to
face
the
crowd
he
was
enormous
his
neck
was
as
thick
as
my
thigh
his
features
chipped
out
of
granite
the
grey
variety
he
threw
back
his
brilliant
purple
cloak
from
his
shoulders
and
reached
out
an
arm
like
an
oak
root
for
the
ceremonial
sword
one
of
the
flunkies
was
struggling
with
he
took
the
sword
with
its
sheath
sat
down
and
stood
it
between
his
feet
his
arms
folded
on
top
who
has
a
grievance
he
spoke
the
voice
reverberated
like
the
old
wurlitzer
at
the
rialto
back
home
this
was
my
cue
there
he
was
just
asking
for
it
all
i
had
to
do
was
speak
up
owner
qohey
would
gladly
oblige
me
the
fact
that
next
to
him
primo
carnera
would
look
dainty
should
slow
me
down
i
cleared
my
throat
with
a
thin
squeak
and
edged
forward
not
very
far
i
have
one
little
item
i
started
nobody
was
listening
up
front
a
big
fellow
in
a
black
toga
was
pushing
through
the
crowd
everybody
turned
to
stare
at
him
there
was
a
craning
of
necks
the
crowd
drew
back
from
the
dias
leaving
an
opening
the
man
in
black
stepped
into
the
clear
flung
back
the
flapping
garment
from
his
right
arm
and
whipped
out
a
long
polished
length
of
iron
it
was
beginning
to
look
like
somebody
had
beaten
me
to
the
punch
the
newcomer
stood
there
in
front
of
qohey
with
the
naked
blade
making
all
the
threat
that
was
needed
qohey
stared
at
him
for
a
long
moment
then
stood
gestured
to
a
flunky
the
flunky
turned
cleared
his
throat
the
place
of
has
been
claimed
he
recited
in
a
shrill
voice
let
the
issue
be
joined
he
skittered
out
of
the
way
and
qohey
rose
threw
aside
his
purple
cloak
and
cowl
and
stepped
down
i
pushed
forward
to
get
a
better
look
the
challenger
in
black
tossed
his
loose
garment
aside
stood
facing
qohey
in
a
jerkin
and
hose
heavy
moccasins
of
soft
leather
were
laced
up
the
calf
he
was
magnificently
muscled
but
qohey
towered
over
him
like
a
tree
with
a
build
that
would
have
taken
the
mr
muscle
beach
title
any
time
he
cared
to
try
for
it
i
did
know
whether
to
be
glad
or
sad
that
the
initiative
had
been
taken
out
from
under
me
if
the
man
in
black
won
i
wondered
would
i
then
be
able
to
step
in
in
turn
and
take
him
on
he
was
a
lot
smaller
than
qohey
but
there
was
always
the
chance
qohey
unsheathed
his
fancy
iron
and
whirled
it
like
it
was
a
putter
i
felt
sorry
for
the
smaller
man
who
was
just
standing
watching
him
he
really
did
have
a
chance
i
had
got
through
to
the
fore
rank
by
now
the
challenger
turned
and
i
saw
his
face
i
stopped
dead
while
fire
bells
clanged
in
my
head
the
man
in
black
was
foster
in
dead
silence
qohey
and
foster
squared
off
touched
their
sword
points
to
the
floor
in
some
kind
of
salute
and
qohey
slicer
whipped
up
in
a
vicious
cut
foster
leaned
aside
just
far
enough
then
countered
with
a
flick
that
made
qohey
jump
back
i
let
out
a
long
breath
and
tried
swallowing
foster
was
like
a
terrier
up
against
a
bull
but
it
did
seem
to
bother
him
only
me
i
had
come
light
years
to
find
him
just
in
time
to
see
him
get
his
head
lopped
off
qohey
blade
flashed
cutting
at
foster
head
foster
hardly
moved
almost
effortlessly
it
seemed
he
interposed
his
heavy
weapon
between
the
attacking
steel
and
himself
clang
qohey
hacked
and
chopped
and
foster
played
with
him
then
foster
arm
flashed
out
and
there
was
blood
on
qohey
wrist
a
gasp
went
up
from
the
crowd
now
foster
took
a
step
forward
struck
and
faltered
in
an
instant
qohey
was
on
him
and
the
two
men
were
locked
chest
to
chest
for
a
moment
foster
held
then
qohey
weight
told
and
foster
reeled
back
he
tried
to
bring
up
the
sword
seemed
to
struggle
then
qohey
lashed
out
again
foster
twisted
took
the
blow
awkwardly
just
above
the
hand
guard
stumbled
and
fell
qohey
leaped
to
him
raised
the
sword
i
hauled
mine
half
way
out
of
its
sheath
and
pushed
forward
let
the
man
be
put
away
from
my
sight
rumbled
qohey
he
lowered
his
immense
sword
turned
pushed
aside
a
flunky
who
had
bustled
up
with
a
wad
of
bandages
as
he
strode
from
the
room
a
swarm
of
bodyguards
fanned
out
between
the
crowd
and
foster
i
could
see
him
clumsily
struggling
to
rise
then
i
was
shoved
back
still
craning
for
a
glimpse
there
was
something
wrong
here
foster
had
acted
like
a
man
suddenly
had
qohey
doped
him
in
some
way
the
cordon
stopped
pushing
turned
their
backs
to
the
crowd
i
tugged
at
the
arm
of
the
man
beside
me
did
you
see
anything
strange
there
i
started
he
pulled
free
strange
yea
the
mercy
of
our
lord
qohey
instead
of
meting
out
death
on
the
spot
our
owner
was
generous
i
mean
about
the
fight
i
grabbed
his
arm
again
to
keep
him
from
moving
off
that
the
impudent
rascal
would
dare
to
claim
the
place
of
owner
at
there
wonder
enough
for
any
man
he
snapped
unhand
me
fellow
i
unhanded
him
and
tried
to
collect
my
wits
what
now
i
tapped
a
bodyguard
on
the
shoulder
he
whirled
club
in
hand
what
to
be
the
fate
of
the
man
i
asked
like
the
boss
said
they
gon
na
immure
the
bum
for
his
pains
you
mean
wall
him
up
yeah
just
a
peep
hole
to
pass
chow
in
every
day
so
he
starve
see
the
bodyguard
chuckled
how
long
he
last
do
worry
after
the
change
owner
qohey
got
a
newman
shut
up
another
bruiser
said
the
crowd
was
slowly
thinning
the
bodyguards
were
relaxing
standing
in
pairs
talking
two
servants
moved
about
where
the
fight
had
taken
place
making
mystical
motions
in
the
air
above
the
floor
i
edged
forward
watching
them
they
seemed
to
be
plucking
imaginary
flowers
strange
i
moved
even
farther
forward
to
take
a
closer
look
then
saw
a
tiny
glint
a
servant
hurried
across
made
gestures
i
pushed
him
aside
groped
and
my
fingers
encountered
a
delicate
filament
of
wire
i
pulled
it
in
swept
up
more
the
servants
had
stopped
and
stood
watching
me
muttering
the
whole
area
of
the
combat
was
covered
with
the
invisible
wires
looping
up
in
coils
two
feet
high
no
wonder
foster
had
stumbled
had
trouble
raising
his
sword
he
had
been
netted
encased
in
a
mesh
of
incredibly
fine
tough
wire
and
in
the
dim
light
even
the
crowd
twenty
feet
away
had
seen
it
owner
qohey
was
a
good
man
with
the
chopper
but
he
did
rely
on
that
alone
to
hold
onto
his
job
i
put
my
hand
on
my
sword
hilt
chewed
my
lower
lip
i
had
found
foster
but
it
would
do
me
or
vallon
much
good
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
dungeons
to
be
walled
up
until
the
next
change
and
it
would
be
three
months
before
i
could
legally
make
another
try
for
qohey
place
after
seeing
him
in
action
i
was
glad
i
had
tried
today
he
would
have
needed
any
net
to
handle
me
i
would
have
to
spend
the
next
three
months
working
on
my
swordplay
and
hope
foster
could
hold
out
maybe
i
could
sneak
a
message
a
heavy
blow
on
the
back
sent
me
spinning
four
bodyguards
moved
to
ring
me
in
clubs
in
hand
they
were
strangers
to
me
but
across
the
room
i
saw
torbu
looming
looking
my
way
i
saw
him
he
started
to
pull
that
fancy
sword
said
one
of
the
guards
he
was
asking
me
questions
unbuckle
it
and
drop
it
another
ordered
me
do
try
anything
what
this
all
about
i
said
i
have
a
right
to
wear
a
ceremonial
sword
at
an
audience
move
in
boys
the
four
men
stepped
toward
me
the
clubs
came
up
i
warded
off
a
smashing
blow
with
my
left
arm
took
a
blinding
crack
across
the
face
felt
myself
going
down
another
blow
and
another
killing
ones
then
i
was
aware
of
being
dragged
endlessly
of
voices
barking
sharp
questions
of
pain
after
a
long
time
it
was
dark
and
silent
and
i
slept
i
groaned
and
the
sound
was
dead
muffled
i
put
out
a
hand
and
touched
stone
on
my
right
my
left
elbow
touched
stone
i
made
an
instinctive
move
to
sit
up
and
smacked
my
head
against
more
stone
my
new
room
was
confining
gingerly
i
felt
my
face
and
winced
at
the
touch
the
bridge
of
my
nose
felt
different
it
was
lower
than
it
used
to
be
in
spite
of
the
swelling
i
lay
back
and
traced
the
pattern
of
pain
there
was
the
nose
smashed
flat
with
secondary
aches
around
the
eyes
they
be
beautiful
shiners
if
i
could
see
them
now
the
left
arm
it
was
curled
close
to
my
side
and
when
i
moved
it
i
saw
why
it
broken
but
the
shoulder
was
right
and
there
was
a
deep
bruise
above
the
elbow
my
knees
and
shin
as
far
as
i
could
reach
were
caked
with
dried
blood
that
figured
i
remembered
being
dragged
i
tried
my
chest
seemed
to
be
okay
my
hands
worked
my
teeth
were
in
place
maybe
i
was
as
sick
as
i
felt
but
where
the
hell
was
i
the
floor
was
hard
cold
i
needed
a
big
soft
bed
and
a
little
soft
nurse
and
a
hot
meal
and
a
cold
drink
foster
i
cracked
my
head
again
and
flopped
back
groaned
some
more
it
still
sounded
pretty
dead
i
swallowed
licked
my
lips
felt
a
nice
split
that
ran
well
into
the
bristles
i
had
attended
the
audience
quite
a
few
hours
must
have
passed
since
then
they
had
taken
foster
away
to
immure
him
somebody
said
then
the
guards
had
tapped
me
worked
me
over
immured
i
got
a
third
crack
on
the
head
suddenly
it
was
hard
to
breathe
i
was
walled
up
sealed
away
from
the
light
buried
under
the
foundations
of
the
giant
towers
of
i
felt
their
crushing
weight
i
forced
myself
to
relax
breathe
deep
being
immured
was
the
same
as
being
buried
alive
not
exactly
this
was
the
method
these
vallonians
had
figured
out
to
end
a
man
life
effectively
without
ending
all
his
lives
they
figured
to
keep
me
neatly
packaged
here
until
my
next
change
thus
acquiring
another
healthy
newman
for
the
kitchen
or
the
stables
they
did
know
the
only
change
that
would
happen
to
me
was
death
they
have
to
feed
me
that
meant
a
hole
i
ran
my
fingers
along
the
rough
stone
found
an
square
opening
on
the
left
wall
just
under
the
ceiling
i
reached
through
it
felt
nothing
but
the
solidness
of
its
thick
sides
how
thick
the
wall
was
i
had
no
way
of
determining
i
was
feeling
dizzy
i
lay
back
and
tried
to
think
i
was
awake
again
there
had
been
a
sound
i
moved
and
felt
something
hit
my
chest
i
groped
for
it
it
was
a
small
loaf
of
hard
bread
i
heard
the
sound
again
and
a
second
object
thumped
against
me
hey
i
yelled
listen
to
me
i
die
in
here
i
not
like
the
rest
of
you
i
wo
go
through
a
change
i
rot
here
till
i
die
i
listened
the
silence
was
absolute
answer
me
i
screamed
you
making
a
mistake
i
gave
up
when
my
throat
got
raw
the
people
who
dropped
the
bread
through
the
little
holes
to
the
prisoners
had
heard
a
lot
of
yelling
in
their
time
they
did
listen
any
more
i
felt
for
the
other
item
that
had
been
pushed
in
to
me
it
was
a
water
bottle
made
of
tough
plastic
i
fumbled
the
cap
off
took
a
swallow
it
was
good
i
tried
the
bread
it
was
tough
tasteless
i
lay
and
chewed
and
wondered
what
i
was
supposed
to
do
about
toilet
facilities
it
was
an
interesting
problem
i
could
see
it
was
going
to
be
a
great
life
while
it
lasted
i
laughed
a
weak
snort
of
despair
as
a
i
was
a
bust
i
had
even
been
able
to
get
around
to
bailing
out
my
pal
foster
after
qohey
had
him
i
wondered
where
he
was
now
sealed
up
in
the
next
probably
but
he
had
answered
my
yells
yeah
mine
had
been
a
great
idea
but
it
had
worked
out
i
had
come
a
long
long
way
and
now
i
was
going
to
die
in
this
reeking
hole
i
had
a
sudden
vision
of
steaks
uneaten
and
life
unlived
i
would
have
been
good
for
another
few
decades
anyway
and
then
i
had
another
thought
if
i
never
had
them
was
it
going
to
be
because
i
had
tried
abruptly
i
was
planning
i
would
keep
calm
and
use
my
head
i
would
wear
myself
out
with
screams
and
struggles
figure
the
angles
use
everything
i
had
to
make
the
best
try
i
could
first
to
explore
the
cell
it
hurt
to
move
but
that
did
matter
i
felt
over
the
walls
estimating
size
my
chamber
was
three
feet
wide
two
feet
high
and
seven
feet
long
the
walls
were
relatively
smooth
except
for
a
few
mortar
joints
the
stones
were
big
eighteen
inches
or
so
by
a
couple
of
feet
i
scratched
at
the
mortar
it
was
rock
hard
i
wondered
how
they
gotten
me
in
some
of
the
stones
must
be
newly
placed
or
else
there
was
a
door
i
could
feel
anything
as
far
as
my
hands
would
reach
maybe
at
the
other
end
i
tried
to
twist
around
no
go
the
people
who
had
built
the
cage
knew
just
how
to
dimension
it
to
keep
the
occupant
oriented
the
way
they
wanted
him
he
was
supposed
to
just
lie
quietly
and
wait
for
the
bread
and
water
to
fall
through
the
hole
above
his
chest
that
was
reason
enough
to
change
positions
if
they
wanted
me
to
stay
put
i
at
least
have
the
pleasure
of
defying
the
rules
and
there
just
might
be
a
reason
why
they
did
want
me
moving
around
i
turned
on
my
side
pulled
my
legs
up
hugged
them
to
my
chest
worked
my
way
down
and
jammed
my
skinned
knees
and
shins
did
help
any
i
inched
them
higher
wincing
at
the
pain
then
braced
my
hands
against
the
floor
and
roof
and
forced
my
torso
toward
my
feet
still
no
go
the
rough
stone
was
shredding
my
back
i
moved
my
knees
apart
that
eased
the
pressure
a
little
i
made
another
inch
i
rested
tried
to
get
some
air
it
was
easy
my
chest
was
crushed
between
my
thighs
and
the
stone
wall
at
my
back
i
breathed
shallowly
wondering
whether
i
should
go
back
or
try
to
push
on
i
tried
to
move
my
legs
they
did
like
the
idea
i
might
as
well
go
on
it
would
be
no
fun
either
way
and
if
i
waited
i
stiffen
up
while
inactivity
and
no
food
and
loss
of
blood
would
weaken
me
further
every
moment
i
would
do
better
next
time
not
even
as
well
this
was
the
time
now
i
set
myself
pushed
again
i
did
move
i
pushed
harder
scraping
my
palms
raw
against
the
stone
i
was
stuck
good
i
went
limp
suddenly
then
i
panicked
in
the
grip
of
claustrophobia
i
snarled
rammed
my
hands
hard
against
the
floor
and
wall
and
heaved
and
felt
my
lacerated
back
slip
along
the
stone
sliding
on
a
lubricating
film
of
blood
i
pushed
again
my
back
curved
doubled
my
knees
were
forced
up
beside
my
ears
i
could
breathe
at
all
now
and
my
spine
was
breaking
it
did
matter
i
might
as
well
break
it
rip
off
all
the
hide
bleed
to
death
i
had
nothing
to
lose
i
shoved
again
felt
the
back
of
my
head
grate
my
neck
bent
creaking
then
i
was
through
stretching
out
to
flop
on
my
back
gasping
my
head
where
my
feet
had
been
score
one
for
our
side
it
took
a
long
time
to
get
my
breath
back
and
sort
out
my
various
abrasions
my
back
was
worst
then
my
legs
and
hands
there
was
a
messy
spot
on
the
back
of
my
head
and
sharp
pains
shot
down
my
spine
and
i
was
getting
tired
of
breathing
through
my
mouth
instead
of
my
smashed
nose
other
than
that
i
never
felt
better
in
my
life
i
had
plenty
of
room
to
relax
in
i
could
breathe
all
i
had
to
do
was
rest
and
after
a
while
they
drop
some
more
nice
bread
and
water
in
to
me
i
shook
myself
awake
there
was
something
about
the
absolute
darkness
and
silence
that
made
my
mind
want
to
curl
up
and
sleep
but
there
was
no
time
for
that
if
there
had
been
a
stone
freshly
set
in
mortar
to
seal
the
chamber
after
i
had
been
stuffed
inside
this
was
the
time
to
find
it
before
it
set
too
hard
i
ran
my
hands
over
the
wall
found
the
joints
the
mortar
was
dry
and
hard
in
the
first
in
the
next
under
my
fingernail
soft
mortar
crumbled
away
i
traced
the
joint
it
ran
around
a
stone
i
raised
myself
on
my
elbows
settled
down
to
scratching
at
it
half
an
hour
later
i
had
ten
bloody
tips
and
a
groove
dug
out
around
the
stone
it
was
slow
work
and
i
could
go
much
farther
without
a
tool
of
some
sort
i
felt
for
the
water
bottle
took
off
the
cap
tried
to
crush
it
it
would
crush
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
cell
maybe
the
stone
would
move
mortar
and
all
if
i
shoved
hard
enough
i
set
my
feet
against
the
end
wall
my
hands
against
the
block
and
strained
until
the
blood
roared
in
my
ears
no
use
it
was
planted
as
solid
as
a
in
the
spare
bedroom
i
was
lying
there
just
thinking
about
it
when
i
became
aware
of
something
it
was
a
noise
exactly
it
was
more
like
a
sound
heard
inside
the
brain
or
the
memory
of
one
but
my
next
sensation
was
perfectly
real
i
felt
four
little
feet
walking
gravely
up
my
belly
toward
my
chin
it
was
my
cat
itzenca
chapter
xvi
for
a
while
i
toyed
with
the
idea
of
just
chalking
it
up
as
a
miracle
then
i
decided
it
would
be
a
nice
problem
in
probabilities
it
had
been
seven
months
since
we
had
parted
company
on
the
pink
terrace
at
where
would
i
have
gone
if
i
had
been
a
cat
and
how
could
i
have
found
me
my
old
pal
from
earth
itzenca
exhaled
a
snuffle
in
my
ear
come
to
think
of
it
the
stink
is
pretty
strong
is
it
i
guess
there
nobody
on
vallon
with
quite
the
same
heady
fragrance
and
what
with
the
close
quarters
here
the
concentration
of
sweat
blood
and
must
be
pretty
penetrating
itz
did
seem
to
care
she
marched
around
my
head
and
back
again
now
and
then
laid
a
tentative
paw
on
my
nose
or
chin
and
kept
up
a
steady
rumbling
purr
the
feeling
of
affection
i
had
for
that
cat
right
then
was
close
to
being
one
of
my
life
grand
passions
my
hands
roamed
over
her
scrawny
frame
fingered
again
the
khaffite
collar
i
had
whiled
away
an
hour
in
fashioning
for
her
aboard
the
lifeboat
my
head
hit
the
stone
wall
with
a
crack
i
did
even
notice
in
ten
seconds
i
had
released
the
collar
clasp
pulled
the
collar
from
itzenca
neck
thumbed
the
stiff
khaffite
out
into
a
blade
about
ten
inches
long
and
was
scraping
at
the
mortar
beyond
my
head
at
fever
heat
they
had
fed
me
three
times
by
the
time
the
groove
was
nine
inches
deep
on
all
sides
of
the
block
and
the
mortar
had
hardened
but
i
was
nearly
through
i
figured
i
took
a
rest
then
made
another
try
at
loosening
the
block
i
thrust
the
blade
into
the
slot
levered
gently
at
the
stone
if
it
was
only
supported
on
one
edge
now
as
it
would
be
if
it
were
a
little
less
than
a
foot
thick
it
should
be
about
ready
to
go
i
could
tell
i
put
down
my
scraper
got
into
position
and
pushed
i
was
as
strong
as
i
had
been
there
was
much
force
in
the
push
again
i
rested
and
again
i
tried
maybe
there
was
only
a
thin
crust
of
mortar
still
holding
maybe
one
more
ounce
of
pressure
would
do
it
i
took
a
deep
breath
strained
and
felt
the
block
shift
minutely
now
i
heaved
again
teeth
gritted
drew
back
my
feet
and
thrust
hard
the
stone
slid
out
with
a
grating
sound
dropped
half
an
inch
i
paused
to
listen
all
quiet
i
shoved
again
and
the
stone
dropped
with
a
heavy
thud
to
the
floor
outside
with
no
loss
of
time
i
pushed
through
behind
it
felt
a
breath
of
cooler
air
got
my
shoulders
free
pulled
my
legs
through
and
stood
for
the
first
time
in
how
many
days
i
had
already
figured
my
next
move
as
soon
as
itzenca
had
stepped
out
i
reached
back
in
groped
for
the
water
bottle
the
dry
crusts
i
had
been
saving
and
the
wad
of
bread
paste
i
had
made
up
i
reached
a
second
time
for
a
handful
of
the
powdered
mortar
i
had
produced
then
lifted
the
stone
i
settled
it
in
place
using
the
hard
bread
as
supports
then
packed
the
open
joint
with
gummy
bread
i
dusted
it
over
with
dry
mortar
then
carefully
swept
up
the
debris
as
well
as
i
could
in
the
total
darkness
the
man
would
have
a
light
and
he
was
due
in
half
an
hour
or
so
as
closely
as
i
had
been
able
to
estimate
the
time
of
his
regular
round
i
did
want
him
to
see
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
i
was
counting
on
finding
foster
filed
away
somewhere
in
the
stacks
and
i
need
time
to
try
to
release
him
i
moved
along
the
corridor
counting
my
steps
one
hand
full
of
breadcrumbs
and
stone
dust
the
other
feeling
the
wall
there
were
narrow
side
branches
every
few
feet
the
access
ways
to
the
feeding
holes
paces
from
my
slot
i
came
to
a
wooden
door
it
locked
but
i
did
open
it
i
was
ready
to
use
it
yet
i
went
back
passed
my
hole
continued
nine
paces
to
a
blank
wall
then
i
tried
the
side
branches
they
were
all
stubs
dead
ends
each
had
the
holes
on
either
side
i
called
foster
name
softly
at
each
hole
but
there
was
no
answer
i
heard
no
signs
of
life
no
yells
or
heavy
breathing
was
i
the
only
one
here
that
what
i
had
figured
on
foster
had
to
be
in
one
of
these
delightful
bedrooms
i
had
come
across
the
universe
to
see
him
and
i
was
going
to
leave
without
him
it
was
time
to
get
ready
for
the
bread
man
i
had
a
choice
of
trying
to
get
back
into
my
hole
and
replacing
the
block
or
of
hiding
in
one
of
the
side
branches
i
thought
it
over
for
a
couple
of
microseconds
and
decided
against
getting
back
in
my
tomb
if
there
were
as
many
vacancies
here
as
i
guessed
i
be
safe
in
any
one
of
the
side
passages
but
my
own
i
groped
my
way
into
a
convenient
itzenca
at
my
heels
with
half
a
year
experience
at
dodging
humans
behind
her
she
could
be
trusted
not
to
show
at
the
crucial
moment
i
figured
i
had
just
jettisoned
my
handful
of
trash
in
the
backmost
corner
of
the
passage
when
there
was
a
soft
grating
sound
from
the
door
i
flattened
myself
against
the
wall
i
know
in
a
second
or
two
how
observant
the
keeper
was
a
light
splashed
on
the
floor
it
must
have
been
dim
but
seemed
to
my
eyes
like
the
blaze
of
noon
soft
footsteps
sounded
i
held
my
breath
a
man
in
bodyguard
trappings
basket
in
hand
moved
past
the
entry
of
the
branch
where
i
stood
went
on
i
breathed
again
now
all
i
had
to
do
was
keep
an
eye
on
the
feeder
watch
where
he
stopped
i
stepped
to
the
corridor
risked
a
glance
saw
him
entering
a
branch
far
down
the
corridor
as
he
disappeared
i
made
it
three
branches
farther
along
ducked
out
of
sight
i
heard
him
coming
back
i
flattened
myself
he
went
by
me
opened
the
door
it
closed
behind
him
and
the
darkness
and
silence
settled
down
once
more
i
stood
where
i
was
feeling
like
a
guy
who
just
showed
up
for
a
party
on
the
wrong
day
the
bread
man
had
stopped
at
one
cell
only
mine
foster
was
here
it
was
a
long
wait
for
the
next
feeding
but
i
put
the
time
to
use
first
i
had
a
good
nap
i
had
been
getting
my
rest
while
i
scratched
my
way
out
of
my
nest
i
woke
up
feeling
better
and
started
thinking
about
the
next
move
the
bodyguard
who
brought
the
food
was
the
first
item
i
had
had
to
get
a
set
of
clothes
somewhere
and
he
be
the
easiest
source
to
tap
if
my
mental
clock
was
right
it
was
about
time
the
door
creaked
and
i
did
a
fast
fade
down
a
side
branch
the
guard
shuffled
into
view
now
was
the
time
i
moved
out
quietly
i
thought
and
he
whirled
dropped
the
load
and
bottle
and
fumbled
at
his
club
hilt
i
did
have
a
club
to
slow
me
down
i
went
at
him
threw
a
beautiful
right
square
to
the
mouth
he
went
over
backwards
with
me
on
top
i
heard
his
head
hit
with
a
sound
like
a
length
of
rubber
hose
slapping
a
grapefruit
he
did
move
i
pulled
the
clothes
off
him
struggled
into
them
they
did
fit
too
well
and
they
probably
smelled
gamey
to
anybody
who
had
spent
a
week
where
i
had
but
details
like
those
did
count
anymore
i
tore
his
sash
into
strips
and
tied
him
he
was
dead
quite
but
i
had
reason
to
know
that
any
yelling
he
did
was
unlikely
to
attract
much
attention
i
hoped
he
enjoy
the
rest
and
quiet
until
the
next
feeding
time
by
then
i
expected
to
be
long
gone
i
lifted
the
door
open
and
stepped
out
into
a
corridor
with
itzenca
abreast
of
me
i
moved
along
in
absolute
stillness
passed
a
side
corridor
came
to
a
heavy
door
locked
we
retraced
our
steps
went
down
the
side
hall
found
a
flight
of
worn
steps
followed
them
up
two
flights
and
emerged
in
a
dark
room
a
line
of
light
showed
around
a
door
i
went
to
it
peered
through
the
crack
two
men
in
stained
tunics
fussed
over
a
boiling
cauldron
i
pushed
through
the
door
the
two
looked
up
startled
i
rounded
a
littered
table
grabbed
up
a
heavy
soup
ladle
and
skulled
the
nearest
cook
just
as
he
opened
up
to
yell
the
other
one
a
big
fellow
went
for
a
cleaver
i
caught
him
in
two
jumps
laid
him
out
cold
beside
his
pal
i
found
an
apron
ripped
it
up
and
tied
and
gagged
the
two
slaves
then
hauled
them
into
a
storeroom
i
was
stacking
vallonians
away
like
a
squirrel
storing
nuts
i
came
back
into
the
kitchen
it
was
silent
now
the
room
reeked
of
sour
soup
a
stack
of
unpleasantly
familiar
loaves
stood
by
the
oven
i
gave
them
a
kick
that
collapsed
the
pile
as
i
passed
to
pick
up
a
knife
i
hacked
tough
slices
from
a
cold
haunch
of
vallonian
mutton
threw
one
to
itzenca
across
the
table
and
sat
and
gnawed
the
meat
while
i
tried
to
think
through
my
plans
owner
qohey
was
a
big
man
to
tackle
but
he
was
the
one
with
the
answers
if
i
could
make
my
way
to
his
apartment
and
if
i
stopped
before
i
forced
the
truth
out
of
him
then
i
might
get
to
foster
and
tell
him
that
if
he
had
the
memory
playback
machine
i
had
the
memory
if
it
had
been
filched
from
the
bottom
of
a
knapsack
aboard
a
lifeboat
parked
at
four
and
a
but
it
was
something
to
shoot
at
my
first
move
would
be
to
locate
qohey
quarters
somewhere
here
in
the
palace
and
get
inside
my
bodyguard
outfit
was
as
good
a
disguise
as
any
for
the
attempt
i
finished
off
my
share
of
the
meat
and
got
to
my
feet
i
have
to
find
a
place
to
clean
myself
up
shave
the
rear
door
banged
open
and
two
bodyguards
came
through
it
talking
loudly
laughing
hey
cook
set
out
meat
for
the
heavy
in
the
lead
stopped
short
gaping
at
me
i
gaped
back

trailed
off
the
other
bodyguard

past
him

started
i
reached
for
the
cleaver

tall
wall
cupboard

club

torbu
watched
as
the
boys
belted
and
strapped
me
into
a
fighting
outfit
i
had
made
him
uneasy
maybe
even
started
him
thinking
if
i
could
last
just
those
minutes
flat
before
owner
qohey
killed
me
then
he
collect
his
bet
i
be
out
of
his
hair
and
he
could
go
back
to

torbu
a
plain
tough
guy
with
a
code
he
could
still
believe
in
and
if
i
won
i
felt
better
in
the
clean
trappings
of
tough
leather
and
steel
torbu
led
the
way
and
fifteen
bodyguards
followed
like
a
herd
of
trolls
there
were
few
palace
servants
out
at
this
hour
those
who
saw
us
gaped
from
a
safe
distance
and
went
on
about
their
business
we
crossed
the
empty
audience
hall
climbed
a
wide
staircase
went
along
a
spacious
corridor
hung
with
rich
brocades
and
carpeted
in
silk
with
soft
lights
glowing
around
ornate
doors
we
stopped
before
a
great
double
door
two
guards
in
dress
purple
sauntered
over
to
see
what
it
was
all
about
torbu
clued
them
in
they
hesitated
looked
us
over
we
goin
in
rookie
said
torbu
open
up
they
did
i
pushed
past
torbu
into
a
room
whose
splendor
made
gope
state
apartment
look
like
a
motel
bright
cintelight
streamed
through
tall
windows
showed
me
a
wide
bed
and
somebody
in
it
i
went
to
it
grabbed
the
bedclothes
and
hauled
them
off
onto
the
floor
owner
qohey
sat
up
slowly
seven
feet
of
muscle
he
looked
at
me
glanced
past
me
to
the
foremost
of
my
escort
he
was
out
of
the
bed
like
a
tiger
coming
straight
for
me
there
was
no
time
to
fumble
with
the
sword
i
went
to
meet
him
threw
all
my
weight
into
a
right
haymaker
and
felt
it
connect
i
plunged
past
whirled
qohey
was
staggering
but
still
on
his
feet
i
had
hit
him
with
everything
i
had
nearly
broken
my
fist
and
he
was
still
standing
i
could
let
him
rest
i
was
after
him
slammed
a
hard
punch
to
the
kidneys
caught
him
across
the
jaw
as
he
turned
drove
a
left
and
right
into
his
stomach
a
girder
fell
from
the
top
of
the
golden
gate
bridge
and
shattered
every
bone
in
my
body
there
was
a
booming
like
heavy
surf
and
i
was
floating
in
it
dead
then
i
was
in
hell
being
prodded
by
tridents
i
blinked
my
eyes
the
roaring
was
fading
now
i
saw
qohey
leaning
against
the
foot
of
the
bed
breathing
heavily
i
had
to
get
him
i
got
my
feet
under
me
stood
up
my
chest
was
caved
in
and
my
left
arm
belonged
to
somebody
else
okay
i
still
had
my
right
i
made
it
over
to
qohey
maneuvered
into
position
he
did
look
at
me
he
seemed
to
be
having
trouble
breathing
those
gut
punches
had
gotten
to
him
i
picked
a
spot
just
behind
the
right
ear
reared
back
and
threw
a
punch
with
my
shoulder
and
legs
behind
it
i
felt
the
jaw
go
qohey
jumped
the
and
piled
onto
the
floor
like
a
freight
hitting
an
open
switch
i
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
sucked
in
air
and
tried
to
ignore
the
whirling
lights
that
were
closing
in
after
awhile
i
noticed
torbu
standing
in
front
of
me
with
the
cat
under
one
arm
both
of
them
were
grinning
at
me
any
orders
owner
drgon
i
found
my
voice
wake
him
up
and
prop
him
in
a
chair
i
want
to
talk
to
him
qohey
did
much
like
the
idea
but
after
torbu
and
a
couple
of
other
lads
had
explained
the
situation
to
him
in
sign
language
he
decided
to
cooperate
get
off
his
head
mull
torbu
said
and
untwist
that
rope
blon
owner
drgon
wants
him
in
a
conversational
mood

i
had
been
feeling
over
my
ribs
trying
to
count
how
many
were
broken
and
how
many
just
bent
qohey
punch
was
a
lot
like
the
kick
of
a
ostrich
he
was
looking
at
me
now
eyes
wild
qohey
i
want
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
if
i
do
like
the
answers

quarters
for
you
in
the
basement
annex
i
just
left
a
cozy
room
there
myself
there
no
view
to
speak
of
but
peaceful
qohey
grunted
something
he
was
having
trouble
talking
around
his
broken
jaw
the
fellow
in
black
i
said
the
one
who
claimed
your
place
as
owner
you
netted
him
and
had
your
bully
boys
haul
him
off
somewhere
i
want
to
know
where
qohey
grunted

him

i
said

his
enunciation
torbu
kicked
the
former
owner
in
the
shin
qohey
jumped
and
glowered
at
him
call
off
your
dogs
he
mumbled
you
not
find
the
upstart
you
seek
here
why
not
i
sent
him
away
where
to
that
place
from
which
you
and
your
turncoat
crew
will
never
fetch
him
back
be
more
specific

spat
torbu
did
much
like
that
crack
about
turncoats
i
said
eager
to
show
you
how
little
i
advise
you
to
talk
fast
and
plain
before
you
lose
a
whole
raft
of
lives
even
these
swine
would
never
dare
i
took
out
the
knife
i
was
wearing
as
part
of
my
i
put
the
point
against
qohey
throat
and
pushed
gently
until
a
trickle
of
crimson
ran
down
the
thick
neck
talk
i
said
quietly
or
i
cut
your
throat
myself
qohey
had
shrunk
back
as
far
as
he
could
in
the
heavy
chair
seek
him
then
assassin
he
sneered
seek
him
in
the
dungeons
of
the
owner
of
owners
keep
talking
i
prompted
the
great
owner
commanded
that
the
slave
be
brought
to
him
at
the
palace
of
sapphires
by
the
shallow
sea
has
this
owners
owner
got
a
name
how
he
hear
about
him
lord
ommodurad
qohey
voice
grated
out
he
was
watching
foot
there
was
that
about
the
person
of
the
stranger
that
led
me
to
inform
him
when
did
he
go
yesterday
you
know
this
sapphire
palace
torbu
sure
he
answered
but
the
place
is
tabu
it
crawlin
with
demons
and
warlocks
the
word
is
there
a
curse
on
the
then
i
go
in
alone
i
said
i
put
the
knife
away
but
first
got
a
call
to
make
at
the
spaceport
at
sure
owner
drgon
the
port
easy
some
say
it
kind
of
haunted
too
but
that
just
a
gag
the
greymen
hang
out
there
we
can
take
care
of
the
greymen
i
said

fifty
of
your
best
men
together
and
line
up
some
i
want
the
outfit
ready
to
move
out
in
half

hour
what
about

chiseler
asked
torbu

him
up
until
i
get
back
if
i
do
make
it
i
know
understand
chapter
xvii
it
was
not
quite
dawn
when
my
task
force
settled
down
on
the
smooth
landing
pad
beside
the
lifeboat
that
had
brought
me
to
vallon
it
stood
as
i
had
left
it
seven
before
the
port
open
the
access
ladder
extended
the
interior
lights
lit
there
were
any
spooks
aboard
but
they
had
kept
visitors
away
as
effectively
as
if
there
had
been
even
the
greymen
did
mess
with
somebody
had
done
a
thorough
job
of
indoctrination
on
vallon
you
ai
gon
na
go
inside
that
accursed
vessel
are
you
owner
drgon
asked
torbu
making
his
cabalistic
sign
in
the
air
it
manned
by
gobblins
that
just
propaganda
where
my
cat
can
go
i
can
go
look
itzenca
scampered
up
the
ladder
and
had
disappeared
inside
the
boat
by
the
time
i
took
the
first
rung
the
guards
gawked
from
below
as
i
stepped
into
the
softly
lit
lounge
the
cylinder
that
was
foster
memory
lay
in
the
bag
i
had
packed
and
left
behind
months
before
with
it
was
the
other
plain
one
ammaerln
memory
somewhere
in
must
be
the
machine
that
would
give
these
meaning
together
foster
and
i
would
find
it
i
found
the
automatic
lying
where
i
had
left
it
i
picked
up
the
worn
belt
strapped
it
around
me
my
vallonian
career
to
date
suggested
it
would
be
a
bright
idea
to
bring
it
along
the
vallonians
had
never
developed
any
personal
armament
to
equal
it
in
a
society
of
immortals
knives
were
considered
lethal
enough
for
all
ordinary
purposes
come
on
cat
i
said
there
nothing
more
here
we
need
back
on
the
ramp
i
beckoned
my
platoon
leaders
over
i
going
to
the
sapphire
palace
i
said
anybody
that
does
want
to
go
can
check
out
now
pass
the
word
torbu
stood
silent
for
a
long
moment
staring
straight
ahead
i
do
like
it
much
owner
he
said
but
i
go
and
so
will
the
rest
of
there
be
no
backing
out
once
we
shove
off
i
said
and
by
the
way
i
jacked
a
round
into
the
chamber
of
the
pistol
raised
it
and
fired
the
shot
into
the
air
they
all
jumped
if
you
ever
hear
that
sound
come
the
men
nodded
turned
to
their
cars
i
picked
up
the
cat
and
piled
into
the
lead
vehicle
next
to
torbu
it
a
run
he
said
we
might
run
into
a
little
greyman
action
on
the
way
we
can
handle
we
lifted
swung
to
the
east
barrelled
along
at
low
altitude
what
do
we
do
when
we
get
there
boss
said
torbu
we
play
it
by
ear
let
see
how
far
we
can
get
on
pure
gall
before
ommodurad
drops
the
hanky
the
palace
lay
below
us
rearing
blue
towers
to
the
twilit
sky
like
a
royal
residence
in
the
munchkin
country
beyond
it
sunset
colors
reflected
from
the
silky
surface
of
the
shallow
sea
the
timeless
stones
and
still
waters
looked
much
as
they
had
when
foster
set
out
to
lose
his
identity
on
earth
three
thousand
years
before
but
its
magnificence
was
lost
on
these
people
the
hulking
crew
around
me
never
paused
to
wonder
about
the
marvels
wrought
by
their
immortal
ancestors
themselves
stolidly
they
lived
their
feudal
lives
in
dismal
contrast
with
the
monuments
all
about
them
i
turned
to
my
cohort
of
hoodlums
you
boys
claim
it
the
demons
and
warlocks
that
keep
the
whole
of
vallon
at
arm
length
from
this
place
in
that
case
there
no
protocol
for
a
new
owner
reception
at
the
blue
palace
a
guy
with
a
little
luck
and
even
less
of
a
memory
than
usual
could
skip
the
goblins
and
play
it
but
dumb
show
up
at
the
palace
grounds
out
of
common
politeness
to
the
top
dog
to
pay
his
respects
anything
wrong
with
that
what
if
they
rush
us
first
before
we
got
time
to
go
into
the
act
said
somebody
in
the
mob
that
where
the
luck
comes
in
i
said
anybody
else
torbu
looked
around
at
his
henchmen
there
was
some
shrugging
of
shoulders
a
few
grunts
he
looked
at
me
you
do
the
figurin
owner
he
said
the
boys
will
back
your
play
we
were
dropping
toward
the
wide
lawns
now
and
still
no
opposition
showed
itself
then
the
towering
blue
spires
were
looming
over
us
and
we
saw
men
forming
up
behind
the
steel
gates
of
the
great
pavilion
a
reception
committee
i
said
hold
tight
fellas
do
start
anything
the
further
in
we
get
peaceably
the
less
that
leaves
to
do
the
hard
way
the
cars
settled
down
gently
and
torbu
and
i
climbed
out
as
quickly
as
the
other
boats
disgorged
their
men
ranks
were
closed
and
we
moved
off
toward
the
gates
itzenca
as
mascot
brought
up
the
rear
still
no
excitement
no
rush
by
the
palace
guards
had
too
many
centuries
of
calm
made
them
lackadaisical
or
did
ommodurad
use
a
brand
of
we
could
see
from
here
we
made
it
to
the
gate
and
it
opened
in
we
go
i
said
but
be
ready
the
uniformed
men
inside
the
compound
obviously
chosen
for
their
beef
content
kept
their
distance
looked
at
us
questioningly
we
pulled
up
on
a
broad
drive
and
waited
for
the
next
move
about
now
somebody
should
stride
up
to
us
and
offer
the
key
to
the
city
or
something
but
there
seemed
to
be
a
hitch
it
was
understandable
after
all
there
had
been
any
callers
dropping
cards
here
for
about
years
it
was
a
long
five
minutes
before
a
hard
case
in
a
carapace
of
armor
and
a
puffy
pink
cape
bustled
down
the
palace
steps
and
came
up
to
us
who
comes
in
force
to
the
sapphire
palace
he
demanded
glancing
past
me
at
my
i
owner
drgon
fellow
i
barked
these
are
my
honor
guard
what
provincial
welcome
is
this
from
the
great
owner
to
a
loyal
that
punctured
his
pomposity
a
little
he
apologized
in
a
way
mumbled
something
about
arrangements
and
beckoned
over
a
couple
of
one
of
them
came
over
and
spoke
to
torbu
who
looked
my
way
hand
on
dagger
hilt
what
this
i
said
where
i
go
my
men
go
there
is
the
matter
of
caste
said
my
greeter
packs
of
retainers
are
not
ushered
into
the
presence
of
lord
ommodurad
owner
of
owners
i
thought
that
one
over
and
failed
to
come
up
with
a
plausible
loophole
okay
torbu
i
said
keep
the
boys
together
and
behave
yourselves
i
see
you
in
an
hour
oh
and
see
that
itzenca
gets
made
comfy
the
beetle
man
snapped
a
few
orders
then
waved
me
toward
the
palace
with
the
slightest
bow
i
ever
saw
a
guard
kept
me
company
up
the
steps
and
into
the
great
pavilion
i
guess
i
expected
the
usual
audience
chamber
or
barbarically
splendid
hall
complete
with
pipers
fools
and
ceremonial
guards
what
i
got
was
an
office
about
sixteen
by
eighteen
and
tasteful
but
i
stopped
in
front
of
a
block
of
grey
marble
with
a
couple
of
quill
pens
in
a
crystal
holder
and
underneath
leg
room
for
a
behemoth
who
was
sitting
behind
the
desk
he
got
to
his
feet
with
all
the
ponderous
mass
of
nero
wolfe
but
a
lot
more
agility
and
grace
you
wish
he
rumbled
i
owner
drgon
ah
great
owner
i
said
i
planned
to
give
my
host
the
routine
i
was
going
to
find
the
second
part
of
the
act
easy
there
was
something
about
ommodurad
that
made
me
feel
like
a
mouse
who
just
changed
his
mind
about
the
cheese
qohey
had
been
big
but
this
guy
could
crush
skulls
as
most
men
pinch
peanut
hulls
and
in
his
eyes
was
the
kind
of
remote
look
that
came
of
three
millenia
of
not
even
having
to
mention
the
power
he
asserted
you
ignore
superstition
observed
the
big
owner
he
did
waste
many
words
it
seemed
gope
had
said
he
was
the
silent
type
it
was
a
bad
lead
i
decided
to
follow
it
do
believe
in
i
said
to
your
business
then
he
continued
why
just
been
chosen
owner
at
i
said
felt
it
was
only
fitting
that
i
come
and
do
obeisance
before
your
grace
that
expression
is
not
used
oh
this
fellow
had
a
disconcerting
way
of
not
getting
sucked
in
lord
ommodurad
he
nodded
just
perceptibly
then
turned
to
the
foremost
of
the
herd
who
had
brought
me
in
quarters
for
the
guest
and
his
retinue
his
eyes
had
already
withdrawn
like
the
head
of
a
galapagos
turtle
into
its
enormous
shell
in
contemplation
of
eternal
verities
i
piped
up
again
ah
pardon
me
the
piercing
stare
of
ommodurad
eyes
was
on
me
again
there
was
a
friend
of
mine
i
gulped
swell
guy
but
impulsive
it
seems
he
challenged
the
former
owner
of
ommodurad
did
no
more
than
twitch
an
but
suddenly
the
air
was
electric
his
stare
did
waver
by
a
millimeter
but
the
lazy
slouch
of
the
six
guards
had
altered
to
sprung
steel
they
had
moved
but
i
felt
them
now
all
around
me
and
not
a
foot
away
i
had
a
sinking
feeling
that
i
gone
too
so
i
thought
maybe
i
crave
your
excellency
help
if
possible
to
locate
my
pal
i
finished
weakly
for
an
interminable
minute
the
owner
of
owners
bored
into
me
with
his
eyes
then
he
raised
a
finger
a
quarter
of
an
inch
the
guards
relaxed
quarters
for
the
guest
and
his
retinue
repeated
ommodurad
he
withdrew
then
without
moving
i
was
dismissed
i
went
quietly
attended
by
my
hulking
escort
i
tried
hard
not
to
let
my
expression
show
any
excitement
but
i
was
feeling
plenty
ommodurad
was
for
a
reason
i
was
willing
to
bet
that
he
had
his
memories
of
the
good
time
intact
instead
of
the
debased
modern
dialect
that
i
heard
everywhere
since
my
arrival
ommodurad
spoke
flawless
old
vallonian
it
was
and
the
palace
of
sapphires
was
silent
i
was
alone
in
the
ornate
bed
chamber
the
great
owner
had
assigned
me
it
was
a
nice
room
but
i
would
learn
anything
staying
in
it
nobody
had
said
i
was
confined
to
quarters
i
do
a
little
scouting
and
see
what
i
could
pick
up
if
anything
i
slung
on
the
holster
and
and
slid
out
of
the
darkened
chamber
into
the
scarcely
lighter
corridor
beyond
i
saw
a
guard
at
the
far
end
he
ignored
me
i
headed
in
the
opposite
direction
none
of
the
rooms
was
locked
there
was
no
arsenal
at
the
palace
and
no
archives
that
lesser
folk
than
the
great
owner
could
use
with
profit
everything
was
easy
of
access
i
guessed
that
ommodurad
rightly
counted
on
indifference
to
keep
snoopers
away
here
and
there
guards
eyed
me
as
i
passed
along
but
they
said
nothing
i
saw
again
by
cintelight
the
office
where
ommodurad
had
received
me
and
near
it
an
ostentatious
hall
with
black
onyx
floor
and
ceiling
gold
hangings
and
ceremonial
but
the
center
of
attraction
was
the
familiar
motif
of
the
concentric
circles
of
the
two
worlds
sketched
in
beaten
gold
across
the
broad
wall
of
black
marble
behind
the
throne
here
the
idea
had
been
elaborated
on
outward
from
both
the
inner
and
outer
circles
flamed
the
waving
lines
of
a
sunburst
at
dead
center
a
boss
like
a
sword
hilt
in
form
chased
in
black
and
gold
erupted
a
foot
from
the
wall
it
was
the
first
time
i
seen
the
symbol
since
i
arrived
on
vallon
i
found
it
strangely
exciting
like
a
footprint
in
the
sand
i
went
on
toured
the
laundry
and
inspected
pantries
large
and
small
and
caught
a
whiff
of
stables
the
palace
was
asleep
few
of
its
occupants
noticed
me
and
those
who
did
hung
back
silent
it
looked
as
if
the
great
owner
had
given
orders
to
let
me
roam
freely
somehow
i
did
find
that
comforting
then
i
came
into
a
hall
and
saw
a
squad
of
guards
the
same
six
who
kept
me
such
close
company
earlier
in
the
day
they
were
drawn
up
at
parade
rest
three
on
each
side
of
a
massive
ivory
door
somebody
lived
in
safety
and
splendor
on
the
other
side
six
sets
of
hard
eyes
turned
my
way
it
was
too
late
to
duck
back
out
of
sight
i
trotted
up
to
the
first
of
the
row
of
guards
say
fella
i
where
the
ah
you
know
every
bed
chamber
is
equipped
he
said
gruffly
raising
his
sword
and
fingering
its
tip
lovingly
yeah
i
never
noticed
i
moved
off
looking
chastened
if
they
thought
i
was
a
kewpie
so
much
the
better
i
was
a
mouse
in
cat
country
here
and
i
was
ready
to
fake
a
not
yet
on
the
ground
floor
i
found
torbu
and
his
cohort
quartered
in
a
off
the
main
entry
hall
we
still
in
enemy
territory
i
reminded
torbu
i
want
every
man
ready
no
fear
boss
said
torbu
all
my
bullies
got
an
eye
on
the
door
and
a
hand
on
a
have
you
seen
or
heard
anything
useful
naw
these
local
dullards
fall
dumb
at
the
first
query
keep
your
ears
cocked
i
want
at
least
two
men
awake
and
on
the
alert
all
night
you
bet
noble
drgon
i
judged
distances
carefully
as
i
went
back
up
the
two
flights
to
my
own
room
inside
i
dropped
into
a
brocaded
easy
chair
and
tried
to
add
up
what
i
seen
first
ommodurad
apartment
as
nearly
as
i
could
judge
was
directly
over
my
own
two
floors
up
that
was
a
break
or
maybe
i
was
where
i
was
for
easier
surveillance
i
skip
that
angle
i
decided
it
tended
to
discourage
me
and
i
needed
all
the
enthusiasm
i
could
generate
second
i
was
going
to
learn
anything
useful
trotting
around
corridors
ommodurad
was
the
kind
to
leave
traces
of
skullduggery
lying
around
where
the
guests
would
see
them
and
third
i
should
have
known
better
than
to
hit
this
fortress
with
two
squads
and
a
in
the
first
place
foster
was
here
qohey
had
said
so
and
the
great
owner
reaction
to
my
mention
of
him
confirmed
it
what
was
it
about
foster
anyway
that
made
him
so
interesting
to
these
top
people
i
have
to
ask
him
that
one
when
i
found
him
but
to
do
that
i
have
to
leave
the
beaten
track
i
went
to
the
wide
double
window
and
looked
up
a
cloud
swept
from
the
great
face
of
cinte
blue
in
the
southern
sky
and
i
could
see
an
elaborately
carved
façade
ranging
up
past
a
row
of
windows
above
my
own
to
a
railed
balcony
bathed
in
a
pale
light
from
the
apartment
within
if
my
calculations
were
correct
that
would
be
ommodurad
digs
the
front
door
was
guarded
like
an
harem
but
the
back
way
looked
like
a
breeze
i
pulled
my
head
back
in
and
thought
about
it
it
was
risky
but
it
had
that
element
of
the
unexpected
that
just
might
let
me
get
away
with
it
tomorrow
the
owner
of
owners
might
have
thought
it
through
and
switched
me
to
another
room
or
to
a
cell
in
the
basement
then
too
did
occur
to
these
vallonians
as
readily
as
it
did
to
a
from
earth
they
had
too
much
to
lose
to
risk
it
on
a
chancey
climb
too
much
thinking
is
never
a
good
idea
when
your
pulse
is
telling
you
it
time
for
action
i
rolled
a
heavy
armoire
fairly
soundlessly
over
the
carpet
and
lodged
it
against
the
door
that
might
slow
down
a
casual
caller
i
slipped
the
magazine
out
of
the
automatic
fitted
nine
greasy
brass
cartridges
into
it
slammed
it
home
dropped
the
pistol
back
in
the
holster
it
had
a
comforting
weight
i
buttoned
the
strap
over
it
and
went
back
to
the
window
the
clouds
were
back
across
cinte
floodlight
that
would
help
i
stepped
out
the
deep
carving
gave
me
easy
handholds
and
i
made
it
to
the
next
windowsill
without
even
working
up
a
light
sweat
compared
with
my
last
climb
back
in
lima
this
was
a
cinch
i
rested
a
moment
then
clambered
around
the
dark
window
just
in
case
there
was
an
insomniac
on
the
other
side
of
the
glass
and
went
on
up
i
reached
the
balcony
had
a
hairy
moment
as
i
groped
outward
for
a
hold
on
the
smooth
above
and
then
i
was
pulling
up
and
over
the
ornamental
iron
work
the
balcony
was
narrow
about
twenty
feet
long
giving
on
half
a
dozen
tall
glass
doors
three
showed
light
behind
heavy
draperies
three
were
dark
i
moved
close
tried
to
see
something
past
the
edge
of
the
draperies
no
go
i
put
an
ear
to
the
glass
thought
maybe
i
heard
a
sound
like
a
distant
volcano
that
would
be
ommodurad
bass
rumble
the
bear
was
in
his
cave
i
went
along
to
the
dark
doors
and
on
impulse
tried
a
handle
it
turned
and
the
door
swung
in
soundlessly
i
felt
my
pulse
pick
up
a
beat
i
stood
peering
past
the
edge
of
the
door
into
the
interior
it
did
look
inviting
in
fact
it
looked
repellent
even
a
country
boy
like
me
could
see
that
to
step
into
the
dragon
den
without
even
a
zippo
to
spot
the
footstools
with
would
be
the
act
of
a
nitwit
i
swallowed
hard
got
a
firm
grip
on
my
pistol
and
went
in
a
soft
fold
of
drapery
brushed
my
face
and
i
had
the
pistol
out
and
my
back
to
the
wall
with
a
speed
that
would
have
made
earp
faint
with
envy
my
adrenals
gave
a
couple
of
wild
jumps
and
my
nervous
system
followed
with
a
variety
of
sensations
none
pleasant
it
took
me
a
minute
to
get
my
adam
apple
swallowed
again
and
remind
myself
that
i
was
a
rough
tough
from
the
planet
earth
who
had
parlayed
one
short
life
into
more
trouble
than
most
vallonians
managed
in
half
of
eternity
and
i
was
on
my
way
to
get
my
pal
foster
out
of
a
tight
spot
hand
him
back
his
memory
and
set
the
two
worlds
back
on
the
rails
they
had
fallen
off
of
about
six
hundred
years
before
alexander
started
looking
around
for
his
first
rumble
i
stopped
before
i
got
so
confident
i
charged
into
the
next
room
and
challenged
ommodurad
to
wrestle
two
falls
out
of
three
i
could
hear
his
voice
better
now
muttering
beyond
the
partition
if
i
could
make
out
what
he
was
saying
i
edged
along
the
wall
found
a
heavy
door
closed
and
locked
no
help
there
i
felt
my
way
further
found
another
door
delicately
i
tried
the
handle
eased
it
open
a
crack
a
closet
half
filled
with
racked
garments
but
i
could
hear
more
clearly
now
maybe
it
was
a
double
closet
with
communicating
doors
both
to
the
room
i
was
in
and
to
the
next
one
where
the
great
owner
was
still
rambling
on
apparently
something
had
overcome
his
aversion
to
talking
there
were
pauses
that
must
have
been
filled
in
by
the
replies
of
somebody
else
who
did
have
the
vocal
timbre
ommodurad
did
i
felt
my
way
through
the
hanging
clothing
felt
over
the
closet
walls
i
was
out
of
luck
there
was
no
other
door
i
put
an
ear
to
the
wall
i
could
catch
an
occasional
word
ring
vaults
it
sounded
like
something
i
like
to
hear
more
about
how
could
i
get
closer
on
impulse
i
reached
up
touched
a
low
ceiling
and
felt
a
ridge
like
the
trim
around
an
access
panel
to
a
crawl
space
i
crossed
my
fingers
stood
on
to
push
at
the
panel
nothing
moved
i
felt
around
in
the
dark
encountered
a
low
shelf
covered
with
shoes
i
investigated
it
was
movable
i
eased
it
aside
a
foot
or
two
piled
the
shoes
on
the
floor
and
stepped
up
the
panel
was
two
feet
long
on
a
side
with
no
discernible
hinges
or
catch
i
pushed
some
more
then
gritted
my
teeth
and
heaved
there
was
a
startlingly
loud
and
the
panel
lifted
i
blinked
away
the
dust
that
settled
in
my
eyes
reached
to
feel
around
within
the
opening
touched
nothing
but
rough
floor
boards
this
would
be
an
excellent
time
i
reflected
to
back
out
of
here
get
a
few
hours
sleep
and
tomorrow
bid
ommodurad
a
hearty
farewell
then
in
a
few
months
after
i
had
had
time
to
organize
my
new
estate
and
align
a
few
supporting
owners
i
could
come
back
in
force
i
cocked
my
head
listening
ommodurad
had
stopped
talking
and
another
voice
said
something
then
there
was
a
heavy
thump
the
clump
of
feet
and
a
metallic
sound
after
a
moment
the
great
owner
voice
came
again
and
the
other
voice
answered
i
stretched
grabbed
the
edge
of
the
opening
and
pulled
myself
up
i
leaned
forward
got
a
leg
up
and
rolled
silently
onto
the
rough
floor
feeling
my
way
i
crawled
felt
a
wall
rising
followed
it
turned
a
corner
the
voices
were
louder
quite
suddenly
i
saw
why
there
was
a
ventilating
register
ahead
gridded
light
gleaming
through
it
i
crept
along
to
the
opening
lay
flat
peered
through
it
and
saw
three
men
ommodurad
was
standing
with
his
back
to
me
a
giant
figure
swathed
to
the
eyes
in
purple
robes
beside
him
a
lean
redhead
with
a
leg
that
had
been
broken
and
badly
set
stood
teeth
bared
in
an
eager
grimace
clutching
a
rod
of
office
the
third
man
was
foster
foster
stood
legs
braced
apart
as
though
to
withstand
an
earthquake
hands
manacled
before
him
he
looked
steadily
at
the
redhead
like
a
man
marking
a
tree
for
cutting
i
know
nothing
of
these
crimes
he
said
ommodurad
turned
swept
out
of
sight
the
redhead
motioned
foster
turned
away
moving
stiffly
passed
from
my
view
i
heard
a
door
open
and
close
i
lay
where
i
was
and
tried
to
sort
out
half
a
dozen
conflicting
impulses
that
clamored
for
attention
a
few
were
easy
it
would
help
matters
to
yell
stop
thief
or
to
fall
through
the
register
and
chase
after
foster
with
loud
cries
of
joy
it
be
much
better
to
scramble
out
dash
downstairs
and
turn
out
my
bodyguards
to
raid
ommodurad
apartment
what
might
do
some
good
was
to
gather
more
information
it
had
been
bad
luck
that
i
had
arrived
at
my
peephole
a
few
minutes
too
late
to
hear
what
the
interview
had
been
all
about
but
i
might
still
make
use
of
my
advantage
i
felt
over
the
register
found
fasteners
at
the
corners
they
lifted
easily
and
the
metal
grating
tilted
back
into
my
hands
i
laid
it
aside
poked
my
head
out
the
room
was
empty
as
far
as
i
could
see
it
was
time
to
take
a
few
chances
i
reversed
my
position
let
my
legs
through
the
opening
and
dropped
softly
to
the
floor
i
reached
back
up
and
managed
to
prop
the
grating
in
position
just
in
case
it
was
a
fancy
chamber
hung
in
purple
and
furnished
for
a
king
i
poked
through
the
pigeonholes
of
a
secretary
opened
a
few
cupboards
peered
under
the
bed
it
looked
like
i
was
going
to
find
any
useful
clues
lying
around
loose
i
went
to
the
glass
doors
to
the
balcony
unlocked
one
and
left
it
ajar
in
case
i
wanted
to
leave
in
a
hurry
there
was
another
door
across
the
room
i
went
over
and
tried
it
locked
that
gave
me
something
definite
to
look
for
a
key
i
rummaged
some
more
in
the
secretary
then
tried
the
drawer
in
a
small
table
beside
a
broad
couch
and
came
up
with
a
nice
little
steel
key
that
looked
like
maybe
i
tried
it
it
was
luck
was
still
coming
my
way
i
pushed
open
the
door
saw
a
dark
room
beyond
i
felt
for
a
light
switch
flicked
it
on
pushed
the
door
shut
behind
me
the
room
looked
like
the
popular
idea
of
a
necromancer
study
the
windowless
walls
were
lined
with
shelves
packed
closely
with
books
the
high
ceiling
hung
like
a
hovering
bat
above
the
ramparted
floor
of
bare
wood
narrow
tables
choked
with
books
and
instruments
stood
along
a
side
of
the
chamber
and
at
the
far
end
i
saw
a
couch
with
a
heavy
apparatus
like
a
beauty
shop
mounted
at
one
end
i
recognized
it
it
was
a
memory
reinforcing
machine
the
first
i
had
seen
on
vallon
i
crossed
the
room
and
examined
it
the
last
one
i
had
seen
on
the
in
the
room
near
the
library
had
been
a
stark
utility
model
this
was
a
deluxe
job
with
soft
upholstery
and
bright
metal
fittings
and
more
dials
and
idiot
lights
than
a
late
model
detroit
status
symbol
this
solved
one
of
the
problems
that
had
been
hovering
around
the
edge
of
my
mind
i
had
fetched
foster
memory
back
to
him
but
without
a
machine
to
use
it
in
it
was
just
a
tantalizing
souvenir
now
all
i
had
to
do
was
sneak
him
away
from
ommodurad
make
it
back
here
all
of
a
sudden
i
felt
tired
vulnerable
helpless
and
all
alone
i
had
been
taking
wild
chances
setting
my
head
more
and
more
brazenly
into
the
kind
of
iron
noose
the
big
owner
would
arrange
for
his
enemies
and
without
the
ghost
of
a
plan
without
even
an
idea
of
what
was
going
on
what
was
ommodurad
interest
in
foster
why
did
he
hide
away
here
keeping
the
rest
of
vallon
away
with
rumors
of
magic
and
spells
what
connection
did
he
have
with
the
disaster
that
had
befallen
the
two
worlds
now
reduced
to
one
and
a
poor
one
at
that
and
why
was
i
a
plain
joe
named
legion
mixed
up
in
it
right
to
the
eyebrows
when
i
could
be
sitting
safe
at
home
in
a
clean
federal
pen
the
answer
to
that
last
one
was
too
hard
to
recite
i
had
had
a
pal
once
a
smooth
character
named
foster
who
had
pulled
me
back
from
the
ragged
edge
just
when
i
was
about
to
make
a
bigger
mistake
than
usual
he
had
been
a
gentleman
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
and
he
had
treated
me
like
one
together
we
had
shared
a
strange
adventure
that
had
made
me
rich
and
had
showed
me
that
it
was
never
too
late
to
straighten
your
back
and
take
on
whatever
the
fates
handed
out
i
had
come
running
his
way
when
trouble
got
too
thick
back
home
and
i
found
him
in
a
worse
spot
that
i
was
in
he
had
come
back
after
the
most
agonizing
exile
a
man
had
ever
suffered
to
find
his
world
fallen
back
into
savagery
and
his
memory
still
eluding
him
now
he
was
in
chains
without
friends
and
without
hope
but
still
not
broken
still
standing
on
his
own
two
feet
but
he
was
wrong
on
one
point
he
had
one
little
hope
not
much
just
a
guy
with
a
penchant
for
bad
decisions
but
i
was
here
and
i
was
free
i
had
my
pistol
on
my
hip
and
a
neat
back
way
into
the
owner
bedroom
and
if
i
played
it
right
and
watched
my
timing
and
had
maybe
just
a
little
luck
say
about
the
amount
it
took
to
hit
the
irish
sweepstakes
i
might
bring
it
off
yet
right
now
it
was
time
to
return
to
my
ommodurad
might
come
back
and
talk
some
more
tip
me
off
to
a
vulnerable
spot
in
the
armor
of
his
fortress
i
went
to
the
door
flicked
off
the
light
turned
the
handle
and
went
rigid
ommodurad
was
back
he
pulled
off
the
purple
cloak
tossed
it
aside
strode
to
a
wall
bar
i
clung
to
the
crack
of
the
door
not
daring
to
move
even
to
close
it
but
my
lord
the
voice
of
the
redhead
said
i
know
he
remembers
not
so
ommodurad
voice
rumbled
on
the
morrow
i
strip
his
mind
to
the
bare
clean
jelly
let
me
dread
lord
with
my
steel
i
have
the
truth
from
him
such
a
one
as
he
your
steel
has
never
known
the
bass
voice
snarled
great
owner
i
crave
but
one
hour
tomorrow
in
the
ceremonial
chamber
i
shall
environ
him
with
the
emblems
of
the
past
enough
ommodurad
fist
slammed
against
the
bar
made
glasses
jump
on
such
starveling
lackwits
as
you
a
mighty
empire
hangs
it
is
a
crime
before
the
gods
and
on
his
head
i
lay
it
the
owner
tossed
off
a
glass
jerked
his
head
at
the
cowering
man
still
i
grant
thy
boon
now
begone
babbler
of
folly
the
redhead
ducked
grinning
disappeared
ommodurad
muttered
to
himself
strode
up
and
down
the
room
stood
staring
out
into
the
night
he
noticed
the
open
balcony
door
pulled
it
shut
with
a
curse
i
held
my
breath
but
no
general
check
of
doors
followed
the
big
man
threw
off
his
clothes
then
he
clambered
up
on
the
wide
couch
touched
a
switch
somewhere
and
the
room
was
dark
within
five
minutes
i
heard
the
heavy
breathing
of
deep
sleep
i
had
found
out
one
thing
anyway
tomorrow
was
foster
last
day
one
way
or
another
ommodurad
and
the
redhead
between
them
would
destroy
him
that
did
leave
much
time
but
since
the
project
was
already
hopeless
it
did
make
much
difference
i
had
a
choice
of
moves
now
i
could
across
to
the
register
and
try
to
wiggle
through
it
without
waking
up
the
brontosaurus
on
the
bed
or
i
could
try
for
the
balcony
door
a
foot
from
where
he
slept
or
i
could
stay
put
and
wait
him
out
the
last
idea
had
the
virtue
of
requiring
no
immediate
daring
adventures
i
could
just
curl
up
on
the
floor
or
better
still
on
the
padded
couch
a
weird
idea
was
taking
shape
in
my
mind
like
a
genie
rising
from
a
bottle
i
felt
in
my
pocket
pulled
out
the
two
small
cylinders
that
represented
two
men
memories
of
hundreds
of
years
of
living
one
belonged
to
foster
the
one
with
the
black
and
golden
bands
but
the
other
was
the
property
of
a
stranger
who
had
died
three
thousand
years
ago
out
in
space
this
cylinder
barely
three
inches
long
held
all
the
memories
of
a
man
who
had
been
foster
confidant
when
he
was
qulqlan
a
man
who
knew
what
had
happened
aboard
the
ship
what
the
purpose
of
the
expedition
had
been
and
what
conditions
they
had
left
behind
on
vallon
i
needed
that
knowledge
i
needed
any
knowledge
i
could
get
to
add
a
to
my
side
of
the
balance
when
the
showdown
came
the
cylinder
would
tell
me
plenty
including
possibly
the
reason
for
ommodurad
interest
in
foster
it
was
simple
to
use
i
merely
placed
the
cylinder
in
the
receptacle
in
the
side
of
the
machine
took
my
place
lowered
the
helmet
into
position
and
in
an
hour
or
so
i
would
awaken
with
another
memories
stored
in
my
brain
to
use
as
i
saw
fit
it
would
be
a
crime
to
waste
the
opportunity
the
machine
i
had
found
here
was
probably
the
only
one
still
in
existence
on
vallon
i
had
blundered
my
way
into
the
one
room
in
the
palace
that
could
help
me
in
what
i
had
to
do
i
had
been
lucky
i
could
waste
that
luck
i
went
across
to
the
chair
spotted
the
recess
in
its
side
and
thrust
the
plain
cylinder
into
it
it
seated
with
a
click
i
sat
on
the
couch
lay
back
reached
up
to
pull
the
headpiece
down
into
position
against
my
skull
there
was
an
instant
of
pain
like
a
lobotomy
performed
without
anesthetic
then
blackness
chapter
xviii
stood
beside
the
royal
couch
where
qulqlan
the
rthr
lay
and
i
saw
that
this
was
the
hour
for
which
i
had
waited
long
for
the
change
was
on
him
stood
at
the
third
hour
of
the
death
watch
all
aboard
slept
save
myself
alone
i
must
move
swiftly
and
at
the
dawn
watch
show
them
the
deed
well
shook
the
sleeping
man
him
who
had
once
been
the
rthr
king
no
more
by
the
law
of
the
change
he
wakened
slowly
looked
about
him
with
the
clear
eyes
of
the
rise
i
commanded
and
the
king
follow
me
i
said
he
made
to
question
me
after
the
manner
of
those
newly
awakened
from
their
change
i
bade
him
be
silent
like
a
lamb
he
came
and
i
led
him
through
shadowed
ways
to
the
cage
of
the
hunters
they
rose
keen
in
their
hunger
to
my
coming
as
i
had
trained
took
the
arm
of
qulqlan
and
thrust
it
into
the
cage
the
hunters
clustered
taking
the
mark
of
their
prey
he
watched
innocent
eyes
that
which
you
feel
is
pain
mindless
one
i
spoke
it
is
a
thing
of
which
you
will
learn
much
in
the
time
before
you
then
they
had
done
and
i
set
the
time
my
chambers
i
cloaked
the
innocent
in
a
plain
purple
robe
and
afterward
led
him
to
the
cradle
where
the
lifeboat
lay
by
virtue
of
the
curse
of
the
gods
which
is
upon
me
one
was
there
before
me
i
waited
not
but
moved
as
the
haik
strikes
and
took
him
fair
in
the
back
with
my
dagger
i
dragged
the
body
into
hiding
behind
the
flared
foot
of
a
column
but
no
sooner
was
he
hidden
well
away
than
others
came
from
the
shadows
summoned
by
some
device
i
know
not
of
they
asked
of
the
rthr
wherefore
he
walked
by
night
robed
in
the
colors
of
ammaerln
of
and
i
knew
black
despair
that
my
grand
design
foundered
thus
in
the
shallows
of
their
i
spoke
forth
with
a
great
show
of
anger
that
i
ammaerln
vizier
and
companion
to
the
rthr
did
but
walk
and
speak
in
confidence
with
my
liege
they
persisted
gholad
foremost
among
them
and
then
one
saw
the
hidden
corse
and
in
an
instant
they
ringed
me
in
did
i
draw
the
long
blade
and
hold
it
at
the
throat
of
qulqlan
press
me
not
or
your
king
will
surely
die
i
said
and
they
feared
me
and
shrank
do
you
dream
that
i
ammaerln
wisest
of
the
wise
have
come
here
for
the
love
of
i
raged
long
have
i
plotted
against
this
hour
to
lure
the
king
in
this
his
princely
yacht
his
faithful
vizier
at
his
side
that
the
change
might
come
to
him
far
from
his
court
then
would
the
ancient
wrong
be
there
are
those
men
born
to
rule
as
the
seeks
the
sun
and
such
a
one
am
i
long
has
this
one
now
mindless
denied
to
me
my
destiny
but
behold
i
with
a
stroke
shall
set
things
below
us
lies
a
green
world
peopled
by
savages
not
one
am
i
to
take
blood
vengeance
on
a
man
newborn
from
the
change
instead
i
shall
set
him
free
to
take
up
his
life
there
below
may
the
fates
lead
him
again
to
royal
state
if
that
be
their
will
there
were
naught
but
fools
among
them
and
they
drew
steel
i
cried
out
to
them
that
all
all
should
share
they
heeded
me
not
but
rushed
upon
me
then
did
i
turn
to
qulqlan
and
drive
the
long
blade
at
his
throat
but
gholad
threw
himself
before
him
and
fell
in
his
place
then
they
pressed
me
and
i
did
strike
out
against
three
who
hemmed
me
close
and
though
they
took
many
wounds
they
persisted
in
their
madness
one
leaping
in
to
strike
and
another
at
my
back
so
that
i
whirled
and
slashed
at
shadows
who
danced
the
end
i
hunted
them
down
in
those
corners
whither
they
had
dragged
themselves
and
each
did
i
put
to
the
sword
and
i
turned
at
last
to
find
the
rthr
gone
and
some
few
with
them
and
madness
took
me
that
i
had
been
gulled
like
a
tinker
by
common
the
chamber
of
the
memory
couch
would
i
find
them
there
they
would
seek
to
give
back
to
the
mindless
one
that
memory
of
past
glories
which
i
had
schemed
so
long
to
deny
him
almost
i
wept
to
see
such
cunning
wasted
terrible
in
my
wrath
i
came
upon
them
there
there
were
but
two
and
though
they
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
the
entry
way
their
poor
dirks
were
no
match
for
my
long
blade
i
struck
them
dead
and
went
to
the
couch
to
lay
my
hand
on
the
cylinder
marked
with
the
vile
gold
and
black
of
qulqlan
that
i
might
destroy
it
and
with
it
the
rthr
forever
i
heard
a
sound
and
whirled
about
a
hideous
figure
staggered
to
me
from
the
gloom
and
for
an
instant
i
saw
the
flash
of
steel
in
the
bloody
hand
of
the
accursed
gholad
whom
i
had
left
for
dead
then
i
knew
cold
agony
between
my
ribs
lay
slumped
against
the
wall
his
face
greenish
above
the
tunic
when
he
spoke
air
whistled
through
his
slashed
have
done
traitor
who
once
was
honored
of
the
king
he
whispered
have
you
no
pity
for
him
who
once
ruled
in
justice
and
splendor
at
high
had
you
not
robbed
me
of
my
destiny
murderous
dog
i
croaked
that
splendor
would
have
been
mine
you
came
upon
him
helpless
gasped
gholad
make
some
amends
now
for
your
shame
let
the
rthr
have
his
mind
which
is
more
precious
than
his
life
i
but
rest
to
gather
strength
soon
will
i
rise
and
turn
him
from
the
couch
then
will
i
die
content
once
you
were
his
friend
gholad
whispered
by
his
side
you
fought
when
both
of
you
were
young
remember
that
and
have
pity
to
leave
him
here
in
this
ship
of
death
mindless
and
alone
i
have
loosed
the
hunters
i
shrieked
in
triumph
with
them
will
the
rthr
share
this
tomb
until
the
end
of
time
i
searched
within
me
and
found
a
last
terrible
strength
and
i
rose
up
and
even
as
my
hand
reached
out
to
pluck
away
the
mind
trace
of
the
king
i
felt
the
bloody
fingers
of
gholad
on
my
ankle
and
then
my
strength
was
gone
and
i
was
falling
headlong
into
that
dark
well
of
death
from
which
there
is
no
returning
i
woke
up
and
lay
for
a
long
time
in
the
dark
without
moving
trying
to
remember
the
fragments
of
a
strange
dream
of
violence
and
death
i
could
still
taste
the
lingering
dregs
of
some
bitter
emotion
but
i
had
more
important
things
to
think
about
than
dreams
for
just
a
moment
i
could
remember
what
it
was
i
had
to
do
then
with
a
start
i
remembered
where
i
was
i
had
lain
down
on
the
couch
and
pulled
the
headpiece
into
place
it
had
worked
i
thought
hard
tried
to
tap
a
new
reservoir
of
memories
drew
a
blank
maybe
my
was
too
alien
for
the
vallonian
to
affect
it
was
another
good
idea
that
had
worked
out
but
at
least
i
had
had
a
good
rest
now
it
was
time
to
get
moving
first
to
see
if
ommodurad
was
still
asleep
i
started
to
sit
up
nothing
happened
i
had
a
moment
of
vertigo
as
my
inner
ear
tried
to
accommodate
to
having
stayed
in
the
same
place
after
automatically
adjusting
to
my
intention
of
rising
i
lay
perfectly
still
and
tried
to
think
it
through
i
had
tried
to
move
and
had
so
much
as
twitched
a
muscle
i
was
paralyzed
or
tied
up
or
maybe
if
i
was
lucky
imagining
things
i
could
try
it
again
and
next
time
i
was
afraid
to
try
suppose
i
tried
and
nothing
happened
again
it
was
better
to
lie
here
and
tell
myself
it
was
all
a
mistake
maybe
i
should
go
back
to
sleep
and
wake
up
later
and
try
it
again
this
was
ridiculous
all
i
had
to
do
was
sit
up
i
nothing
i
lay
in
the
dark
and
tried
to
will
an
arm
to
move
my
head
to
turn
it
was
as
though
i
had
no
arm
no
head
just
a
mind
alone
in
the
dark
i
strained
to
sense
the
ropes
that
held
me
down
still
nothing
no
ropes
no
arms
no
body
there
was
no
pressure
against
me
from
the
couch
no
vagrant
itch
or
cramp
no
physical
sensation
i
was
a
disembodied
brain
lying
nestled
in
a
great
bed
of
pitchblack
cotton
wool
then
abruptly
i
was
aware
of
myself
not
the
gross
mechanism
of
bone
and
muscle
but
the
field
generated
within
a
brain
alive
with
flashing
currents
and
a
lightning
interplay
of
molecular
forces
a
sense
of
orientation
grew
i
occupied
a
block
of
cells
here
in
the
left
hemisphere
the
mass
of
neural
tissue
loomed
over
me
gigantic
and
i
i
was
reduced
to
the
elemental
ego
who
possessed
as
a
material
appurtenance
my
arms
and
legs
my
body
my
brain
relieved
of
outside
stimuli
i
was
able
now
to
conceptualize
myself
as
i
actually
was
an
insubstantial
state
existing
in
an
immaterial
continuum
created
by
the
action
of
neural
currents
within
the
cerebrum
as
a
magnetic
field
is
created
in
space
by
the
flow
of
electricity
and
i
knew
what
had
happened
i
had
opened
my
mind
to
invasion
by
alien
memories
the
other
mind
had
seized
upon
the
sensory
centers
and
driven
me
to
this
dark
corner
i
was
a
fugitive
within
my
own
skull
for
a
timeless
time
i
lay
stunned
immured
now
as
the
massive
stones
of
had
never
confined
me
my
basic
still
survived
out
was
shunted
aside
cut
off
from
any
contact
with
the
body
itself
with
shadowy
fingers
of
imagination
i
clawed
at
the
walls
surrounding
me
fought
for
a
glimpse
of
light
for
a
way
out
and
found
none
then
at
last
i
began
again
to
think
i
must
analyze
my
awareness
of
my
surroundings
seek
out
channels
through
which
impulses
from
sensory
nerves
flowed
and
tap
them
i
tried
cautiously
an
extension
of
my
reached
out
with
ultimate
delicacy
there
were
the
ranked
infinities
of
cells
there
the
rushing
torrents
of
gross
fluid
there
the
taut
cables
of
the
interconnecting
web
and
there
barrier
blank
and
impregnable
the
wall
reared
up
my
questing
tendril
of
raced
over
the
surface
like
an
ant
over
a
melon
and
found
no
tiniest
fissure
it
loomed
alien
inscrutable
the
invader
who
had
stolen
my
brain
i
withdrew
to
dissipate
my
force
was
senseless
i
must
select
a
point
of
attack
hurl
against
it
all
the
power
of
my
surviving
identity
before
it
too
dwindled
away
and
the
abstraction
that
was
legion
vanished
forevermore
the
last
of
the
phantom
emotions
that
had
clung
for
how
long
to
the
incorporeal
mind
field
had
faded
now
leaving
me
with
no
more
than
an
intellectual
determination
to
reassert
myself
dimly
i
recognized
this
sign
of
my
waning
sense
of
identity
but
there
was
no
surge
of
instinctive
fear
instead
i
coolly
assessed
my
resources
and
almost
at
once
stumbled
into
an
unused
channel
here
within
my
own
for
a
moment
i
recoiled
from
the
outré
configuration
of
the
stored
patterns
and
then
i
remembered
i
had
been
in
the
water
struggling
while
the
red
soldier
waited
rifle
aimed
and
then
a
flood
of
data
flowing
with
cold
impersonal
precision
and
i
had
deftly
marshalled
the
forces
of
my
body
to
survive
and
once
more
as
i
hung
by
numbed
fingers
under
the
cornice
of
the
yordano
building
the
cold
voice
had
spoken
and
i
had
forgotten
the
miracle
had
been
pushed
back
rejected
by
the
conscious
mind
but
now
i
knew
this
was
the
knowledge
that
i
had
received
from
the
background
briefing
device
that
i
had
used
in
my
island
before
i
fled
this
was
the
survival
data
known
to
all
old
vallonians
of
the
days
of
the
two
worlds
it
had
lain
here
unused
the
secrets
of
superhuman
strength
and
endurance
buried
by
the
imbecile
of
aversion
to
the
alien
but
the
ego
alone
remained
now
stripped
of
the
burden
of
neurosis
freed
from
subconscious
pressures
the
levels
of
the
mind
were
laid
bare
and
i
saw
close
at
hand
the
regions
where
dreams
were
born
the
barren
sources
of
instinctive
the
linkages
to
blinding
emotions
and
all
lay
now
under
my
overt
control
without
further
hesitation
i
tapped
the
stored
vallonian
knowledge
encompassed
it
made
it
mine
then
again
i
approached
the
barrier
spread
out
across
it
probed
in
vain
vile
primitive
the
thought
thundered
out
with
crushing
force
i
recoiled
then
renewed
my
attack
alert
now
i
knew
what
to
do
i
sought
and
found
a
line
of
synaptic
weakness
burrowed
at
it
intolerable
vestigial
erasure
i
struck
instantly
slipped
past
the
shield
laid
firm
hold
on
an
optic
receptor
bank
the
alien
mind
threw
itself
against
me
but
too
late
i
held
secure
and
the
assault
faded
withdrew
cautiously
i
extended
my
interpretive
receptivity
there
was
a
pattern
of
pulses
oscillations
in
the
range
i
tuned
focussed
abruptly
i
was
seeing
for
a
moment
my
fragile
equilibrium
tottered
as
i
strove
to
integrate
the
flow
of
external
stimuli
into
my
bodiless
then
a
balance
was
struck
i
held
my
ground
and
stared
through
the
one
eye
i
had
recaptured
from
the
usurper
and
i
reeled
again
bright
daylight
blazed
in
the
chamber
of
ommodurad
the
scene
shifted
as
the
body
moved
about
crossing
the
room
turning
i
had
assumed
that
the
body
still
lay
in
the
dark
but
instead
it
walked
without
my
knowledge
propelled
by
a
stranger
the
field
of
vision
flashed
across
the
couch
ommodurad
was
gone
i
sensed
that
the
entire
left
lobe
disoriented
by
the
loss
of
the
eye
had
slipped
now
to
secondary
awareness
its
defenses
weakened
i
retreated
momentarily
from
my
optic
outpost
laid
a
temporary
traumatic
block
across
the
access
nerves
to
keep
the
intruder
from
reasserting
possession
and
concentrated
my
force
in
an
attack
on
the
auricular
channels
it
was
an
easy
rout
instantly
my
eye
coordinated
its
impressions
with
those
coming
in
along
the
aural
nerves
and
heard
my
voice
mouth
a
curse
the
body
was
standing
beside
a
bare
wall
with
a
hand
laid
upon
it
in
the
wall
a
recess
partly
obscured
by
a
sliding
panel
stood
empty
the
body
turned
strode
to
a
doorway
emerged
into
a
gloomy
corridor
the
glance
flicked
from
the
face
of
one
guard
to
another
they
stared
in
surprise
brought
weapons
up
you
dare
to
bar
the
path
to
the
lord
ammaerln
my
voice
slashed
at
the
men
stand
aside
as
you
value
your
lives
and
the
body
pushed
past
them
striding
off
along
the
corridor
it
passed
through
a
great
archway
descended
a
flight
of
marble
stairs
came
along
a
hall
i
had
seen
on
my
tour
of
the
palace
of
sapphires
and
into
the
onyx
chamber
with
the
great
golden
sunburst
that
covered
the
high
black
wall
in
the
great
owner
chair
at
the
ommodurad
sat
scowling
at
the
lame
courtier
whose
red
hair
was
hidden
now
under
a
black
cowl
between
them
foster
stood
the
heavy
manacles
dragging
at
his
wrists
ommodurad
turned
his
face
paled
then
flushed
darkly
he
rose
teeth
bared
the
gaze
of
my
eye
fixed
on
foster
foster
stared
back
a
look
of
incredulity
growing
on
his
face
my
lord
rthr
i
heard
my
voice
say
the
eye
swept
down
and
fixed
on
the
manacles
the
body
drew
back
a
step
as
if
in
horror
you
overreach
yourself
ommodurad
my
voice
cried
harshly
ommodurad
stepped
toward
me
his
immense
arm
raised
lay
not
a
hand
on
me
dog
of
a
usurper
my
voice
roared
out
by
the
gods
would
you
take
me
for
common
clay
and
unbelievably
ommodurad
paused
stared
in
my
face
i
know
you
as
the
upstart
drgon
petty
owner
he
rumbled
but
i
know
i
see
another
there
behind
your
pale
eyes
foul
was
the
crime
that
brought
me
to
this
pass
my
voice
said
but
know
that
your
master
ammaerln
stands
before
you
in
the
body
of
a
primitive
ammaerln
ommodurad
jerked
as
though
he
had
been
struck
my
body
turned
dismissing
him
the
eye
rested
on
foster
my
liege
my
voice
said
unctuously
i
swear
the
dog
dies
for
this
treason
it
is
a
mindless
one
intruder
ommodurad
broke
in
seek
no
favor
with
the
rthr
for
he
that
was
rthr
is
no
more
you
deal
with
me
now
my
body
whirled
on
ommodurad
give
a
thought
to
your
tone
lest
your
ambitions
prove
your
death
ommodurad
put
a
hand
to
his
dagger
ammaerln
of
you
may
be
or
a
changeling
from
dark
regions
i
know
not
of
but
know
that
this
day
i
hold
all
power
in
vallon
and
what
of
this
one
who
was
once
qulqlan
what
consort
do
you
hold
with
him
you
say
is
mindless
i
saw
my
hand
sweep
out
in
a
contemptuous
gesture
at
foster
an
end
to
patience
the
great
owner
roared
shall
i
stand
in
my
inner
citadel
and
give
account
of
myself
to
a
madman
he
started
toward
my
body
does
the
fool
ommodurad
forget
the
power
of
the
great
ammaerln
my
voice
said
softly
and
the
towering
figure
hesitated
once
more
searching
my
face
the
rthr
hour
is
past
and
yours
bungler
and
fool
my
voice
went
on
your
months
or
is
it
years
of
are
ended
my
voice
rose
in
a
bellow
know
that
i
ammaerln
the
great
have
returned
to
rule
at
high
months
rumbled
ommodurad
indeed
i
believe
the
tales
of
the
greymen
are
true
and
that
an
evil
spirit
has
returned
to
haunt
me
you
speak
of
months
he
threw
back
his
head
laughed
a
choked
throaty
laugh
that
was
half
sob
know
demon
or
madman
or
ancient
prince
of
evil
for
thirty
centuries
have
i
brooded
alone
sealed
from
an
empire
by
a
single
key
i
felt
the
shock
rack
through
and
through
the
invader
mind
this
was
the
opportunity
i
had
hoped
for
quick
as
thought
i
moved
slashed
at
the
wavering
shield
and
was
past
it
i
grappled
onto
the
foul
scanned
its
symbolisms
a
miasma
of
twisted
concepts
like
great
webs
asquirm
with
bristling
nodes
like
crouching
spiders
and
through
it
all
a
yammering
torrent
of
deformed
in
my
eagerness
i
was
careless
the
invader
mind
recovering
struck
back
too
late
i
felt
it
slip
into
my
awareness
flick
over
the
stored
information
i
leaped
to
protect
one
fact
and
lost
my
gains
with
only
a
single
tenuous
line
of
rapport
with
the
alien
mind
still
open
i
clung
shaken
but
hugging
precious
patterns
of
stolen
data
my
raid
had
been
no
more
than
an
irritation
to
the
other
mind
but
i
had
fetched
away
a
mass
of
information
i
interpreted
it
integrated
it
matched
it
to
known
patterns
a
complex
structure
of
relationships
evolved
growing
into
a
new
awareness
upon
the
of
foster
face
was
now
another
that
of
qulqlan
rthr
of
all
vallon
ruler
of
the
two
worlds
and
other
pictures
snatched
from
the
intruder
mind
were
present
now
in
the
of
me
legion
the
vaults
deep
in
the
rock
under
the
fabled
city
of
where
the
of
every
citizen
was
stored
sealed
by
the
rthr
and
keyed
to
his
mind
alone
ammaerln
urging
the
king
to
embark
on
a
stressing
the
burden
of
government
tempting
him
to
bring
with
him
the
royal
qulqlan
acquiescence
and
ammaerln
secret
joy
at
the
advancement
of
his
scheme
the
coming
of
the
change
for
the
rthr
aboard
ship
far
out
in
space
and
the
vizier
bold
stroke
and
then
the
fools
who
found
him
at
the
lifeboat
and
the
loss
of
all
all
there
my
own
memories
took
up
the
tale
the
awakening
of
foster
unsuspecting
and
his
recording
of
the
mind
of
the
dying
ammaerlin
the
flight
from
the
hunters
the
of
the
king
that
lay
for
three
millenia
among
neolithic
bones
until
i
a
primitive
plucked
it
from
its
place
and
the
pocket
of
a
coarse
fibre
garment
where
the
cylinder
lay
now
on
the
hip
of
the
body
i
inhabited
but
as
inaccessible
to
me
as
if
it
had
been
a
million
miles
away
but
there
was
a
second
ammaerln
i
had
crossed
a
galaxy
to
come
to
foster
and
with
me
locked
in
an
unmarked
pewter
cylinder
i
had
brought
foster
ancient
nemesis
i
had
given
it
life
and
a
body
foster
once
rthr
had
survived
against
all
logic
and
had
come
back
back
from
the
dead
the
last
hope
of
a
golden
age
to
meet
his
fate
at
my
hands
three
thousand
years
i
heard
my
voice
saying
three
thousand
years
have
the
men
of
vallon
lived
mindless
with
the
glory
that
was
vallon
locked
away
in
a
vault
without
a
key
i
alone
said
ommodurad
have
borne
the
curse
of
knowledge
long
ago
in
the
days
of
the
rthr
i
took
my
from
the
vaults
in
anticipation
of
the
day
of
days
when
he
should
fall
little
joy
has
it
brought
me
and
now
my
voice
said
you
think
to
force
this
mind
that
is
no
mind
to
unseal
the
vault
i
know
it
for
a
hopeless
task
ommodurad
said
at
first
i
thought
since
he
speaks
the
tongue
of
old
vallon
that
he
dissembled
but
he
knows
nothing
this
is
but
the
dry
husk
of
the
rthr
and
i
sicken
of
the
sight
i
would
fain
kill
him
now
and
let
the
long
farce
end
not
so
my
voice
cut
in
once
i
decreed
exile
to
the
mindless
one
so
be
it
the
face
of
ommodurad
twisted
in
its
rage
your
witless
chatterings
too
i
tire
of
them
wait
my
voice
snarled
would
you
put
aside
the
key
there
was
a
silence
as
ommodurad
stared
at
my
face
i
saw
my
hand
rise
into
view
gripped
in
it
was
foster
the
two
worlds
lie
in
my
hand
my
voice
spoke
observe
well
the
black
and
golden
bands
of
the
royal
who
holds
this
key
is
as
for
the
mindless
body
yonder
let
it
be
destroyed
ommodurad
locked
eyes
with
mine
then
let
the
deed
be
done
he
said
the
redhead
drew
a
long
stiletto
from
under
his
cloak
smiling
i
could
wait
no
longer
along
the
link
i
had
kept
through
the
intruder
barrier
i
poured
the
last
of
the
stored
energy
of
my
mind
i
felt
the
enemy
recoil
then
strike
back
with
crushing
force
but
i
was
past
the
shield
as
the
invader
reached
out
to
encircle
me
i
shattered
my
unified
forward
impulse
into
myriad
nervous
streamlets
that
flowed
on
under
over
and
around
the
opposing
force
i
spread
myself
through
and
through
the
inner
drawing
new
power
from
the
trunk
sources
i
caught
a
vicious
blast
of
pure
wrath
that
rocked
me
and
then
i
grappled
shield
to
shield
with
the
alien
and
he
was
stronger
like
a
corrosive
fluid
the
massive
shredded
my
extended
i
drew
back
slowly
reluctantly
i
caught
a
shadowy
impression
of
the
body
standing
rigid
eyes
blank
and
sensed
a
rumbling
voice
that
spoke
quick
the
intruder
now
i
struck
for
the
right
optic
center
clamped
down
with
a
death
grip
the
enemy
mind
went
mad
as
the
darkness
closed
in
i
heard
my
voice
scream
and
i
saw
in
vivid
pantomime
the
vision
that
threatened
the
invader
the
redhead
darting
to
me
the
stiletto
flashing
and
then
the
invading
mind
broke
swirled
into
chaos
and
was
gone
i
reeled
shocked
and
alone
inside
my
skull
the
brain
loomed
dark
and
untenanted
now
i
began
to
move
crept
along
the
major
nerve
paths
reoccupied
the
cortex
agony
i
twisted
felt
again
with
a
massive
return
of
sensation
my
arms
my
legs
opened
both
eyes
to
see
blurred
figures
moving
and
in
my
chest
a
hideous
pain
i
was
sprawled
on
the
floor
gasping
sudden
understanding
came
the
redhead
had
struck
and
the
other
mind
in
full
rapport
with
the
pain
centers
had
broken
under
the
shock
left
the
stricken
brain
to
me
alone
as
through
a
red
veil
i
saw
the
giant
figure
of
ommodurad
loom
stoop
over
me
rise
with
the
royal
cylinder
in
his
hand
and
beyond
foster
strained
backward
the
chain
between
his
wrists
garroting
the
redhead
ommodurad
turned
took
a
step
flicked
the
man
from
foster
grasp
and
hurled
him
aside
he
drew
his
dagger
quick
as
a
hunting
cat
foster
leaped
struck
with
the
manacles
and
the
knife
clattered
across
the
floor
ommodurad
backed
away
with
a
curse
while
the
redhead
seized
the
stiletto
he
had
let
fall
and
moved
in
foster
turned
to
meet
him
staggering
and
raised
heavy
arms
i
fought
to
move
got
my
hand
as
far
as
my
side
fumbled
with
the
leather
strap
the
alien
mind
had
stolen
from
my
brain
the
knowledge
of
the
cylinder
but
i
had
kept
from
it
the
fact
of
the
pistol
i
had
my
hand
on
its
butt
now
painfully
i
drew
it
dragged
my
arm
up
struggled
to
raise
the
weapon
centered
it
on
the
back
of
the
mop
of
red
hair
free
now
of
the
cowl
and
fired
ommodurad
had
found
his
dagger
he
turned
back
from
the
corner
where
foster
had
sent
it
spinning
spattered
with
the
blood
of
the
redhead
foster
retreated
until
his
back
was
at
the
wall
a
haggard
figure
against
the
gaudy
golden
sunburst
the
flames
of
beaten
metal
shimmered
and
flared
before
my
dimming
vision
the
great
gold
circles
of
the
two
worlds
seemed
to
revolve
while
waves
of
darkness
rolled
over
me
but
there
was
a
thought
something
i
had
found
among
the
patterns
in
the
intruder
mind
at
the
center
of
the
sunburst
rose
a
boss
in
black
and
gold
erupting
a
foot
from
the
wall
like
a
the
thought
came
from
far
away
the
sword
of
the
rthr
used
once
in
the
dawn
of
a
world
by
a
warrior
king
but
laid
away
now
locked
in
its
sheath
of
stone
keyed
to
the
of
the
rthr
that
none
other
might
ever
draw
it
to
some
ignoble
end
a
sword
keyed
to
the
basic
of
the
king
i
drew
a
last
breath
blinked
back
the
darkness
ommodurad
stepped
past
me
knife
in
hand
toward
the
unarmed
man
foster
i
croaked
the
sword
foster
head
came
up
i
had
spoken
in
english
the
syllables
rang
strangely
in
that
outworld
setting
ommodurad
ignored
the
unknown
words
draw
the
sword
from
the
stone
you
qulqlan
rthr
of
vallon
i
saw
him
reach
out
grasp
the
ornate
hilt
ommodurad
with
a
cry
leaped
toward
him
the
sword
slid
out
smoothly
four
feet
of
glittering
steel
ommodurad
stopped
stared
at
the
manacled
hands
gripping
the
hilt
of
the
fabled
blade
slowly
he
sank
to
his
knees
bent
his
neck
i
yield
qulqlan
he
said
i
crave
the
mercy
of
the
rthr
behind
me
i
heard
thundering
feet
dimly
i
was
aware
of
torbu
raising
my
head
of
foster
leaning
over
me
they
were
saying
something
but
i
could
hear
my
feet
were
cold
and
the
coldness
crept
higher
i
felt
hands
touch
me
and
the
cool
smoothness
of
metal
against
my
temples
i
wanted
to
say
something
tell
foster
that
i
had
found
the
answer
the
one
that
had
always
eluded
me
before
i
wanted
to
tell
him
that
all
lives
are
the
same
length
when
viewed
from
the
foreshortened
perspective
of
death
and
that
life
like
music
requires
no
meaning
but
only
a
certain
symmetry
but
it
was
too
hard
i
tried
to
cling
to
the
thought
to
carry
it
with
me
into
the
cold
void
toward
which
i
moved
but
it
slipped
away
and
there
was
only
my
alone
in
emptiness
and
the
winds
that
swept
through
eternity
blew
away
the
last
shred
of
ego
and
i
was
one
with
darkness
epilogue
i
awoke
to
a
light
like
that
of
a
morning
when
the
world
was
young
gossamer
curtains
fluttered
at
tall
windows
through
which
i
saw
a
squadron
of
trim
white
clouds
riding
in
a
high
blue
sky
i
turned
my
head
and
foster
stood
beside
me
dressed
in
a
short
white
tunic
that
a
crazy
set
of
threads
foster
i
said
but
on
your
build
it
looks
good
but
you
aged
you
look
if
you
look
a
day
foster
smiled
welcome
to
vallon
my
friend
he
said
in
english
i
noticed
that
he
faltered
a
bit
over
the
words
as
if
he
had
used
them
for
a
long
time
vallon
i
said
then
it
was
all
a
dream
regard
it
as
a
dream
legion
your
life
begins
today
there
was
something
i
said
something
i
had
to
do
but
it
seem
to
matter
i
feel
relaxed
inside
someone
came
forward
from
behind
foster
gope
i
said
then
i
hesitated
you
are
gope
are
you
i
said
in
vallonian
he
laughed
i
was
known
by
that
name
once
he
said
but
my
true
name
is
gwanne
my
eyes
fell
on
my
legs
i
saw
that
i
was
wearing
a
tunic
like
except
that
mine
was
pale
blue
who
put
the
dress
on
me
i
asked
and
where
my
pants
this
garment
suits
you
better
said
gope
come
look
in
the
glass
i
got
to
my
feet
stepped
to
a
long
mirror
glanced
at
the
reflection
it
not
the
real
me
boys
i
started
then
i
stared
a
hercules
and
stared
back
i
shut
my
mouth
and
his
mouth
shut
i
moved
an
arm
and
he
did
likewise
i
whirled
on
foster
what
how
who
the
mortal
body
that
was
legion
died
of
its
wounds
he
said
but
the
mind
that
was
the
man
was
recorded
we
have
waited
many
years
to
give
that
mind
life
again
i
turned
back
to
the
mirror
gaped
the
young
giant
gaped
back
i
remember
i
said
i
remember
a
knife
in
my
guts
and
a
redheaded
man
and
the
great
owner
and
for
his
crimes
told
gope
he
went
to
a
place
of
exile
until
the
change
should
come
on
him
long
have
we
waited
i
looked
again
and
now
i
saw
two
faces
in
the
mirror
and
both
of
them
were
young
one
was
low
down
just
above
my
ankles
and
it
belonged
to
a
cat
i
had
known
as
itzenca
the
other
higher
up
was
that
of
a
man
i
had
known
as
ommodurad
but
this
was
a
ommodurad
just
under
onto
the
blank
slate
we
traced
your
mind
said
gope
he
owed
you
a
life
legion
foster
said
his
own
was
forfeit
i
guess
i
ought
to
kick
and
scream
and
demand
my
original
ugly
puss
back
i
said
slowly
studying
my
reflection
but
the
fact
is
i
like
looking
like
mr
universe
your
earthly
body
was
infected
with
the
germs
of
old
age
said
foster
now
you
can
look
forward
to
a
great
span
of
life
but
come
said
gope
all
vallon
waits
to
honor
you
he
led
the
way
to
the
tall
window
your
place
is
by
my
side
at
the
great
said
foster
and
afterwards
all
of
the
two
worlds
lie
before
you
i
looked
past
the
open
window
and
saw
a
carpet
of
velvet
green
that
curved
over
foothills
to
the
rim
of
a
forest
down
the
long
sward
i
saw
a
procession
of
bright
knights
and
ladies
come
riding
on
animals
some
black
some
golden
palomino
that
looked
for
all
the
world
like
unicorns
my
eyes
traveled
upward
to
where
the
light
of
a
great
white
sun
flashed
on
blue
towers
and
somewhere
trumpets
sounded
it
looks
like
a
pretty
fair
offer
i
said
i
take
it
a
trace
of
memory
help
wanted
soldier
of
fortune
seeks
companion
in
arms
to
share
unusual
adventure
foster
box
legion
was
desperate
but
not
that
desperate
even
petty
larceny
seemed
preferable
to
that
kind
of
proposal
but
fate
stepped
in
and
now
he
is
on
the
run
pursued
by
cops
the
cia
and
a
few
acquaintances
of
foster
and
foster
has
lost
his
memory
not
to
mention
about
thirty
years
of
his
age
the
key
to
legion
dilemma
and
to
foster
forgotten
past
is
in
a
row
of
metal
cylinders
aboard
a
spaceship
that
has
been
orbiting
earth
for
thousands
of
years
and
legion
troubles
have
really
