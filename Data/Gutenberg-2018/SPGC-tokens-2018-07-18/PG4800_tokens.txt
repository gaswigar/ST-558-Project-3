the
complete
poetical
works
of
percy
bysshe
shelley
volume
oxford
edition
including
materials
never
before
printed
in
any
edition
of
the
poems
edited
with
textual
notes
by
thomas
hutchinson
a
editor
of
the
oxford
wordsworth
preface
this
edition
of
his
poetical
works
contains
all
ascertained
poems
and
fragments
of
verse
that
have
hitherto
appeared
in
print
in
preparing
the
volume
i
have
worked
as
far
as
possible
on
the
principle
of
recognizing
the
editio
princeps
as
the
primary
textual
authority
i
have
not
been
content
to
reprint
recension
of
or
that
of
any
subsequent
editor
of
the
poems
the
present
text
is
the
result
of
a
fresh
collation
of
the
early
editions
and
in
every
material
instance
of
departure
from
the
wording
of
those
originals
the
rejected
reading
has
been
subjoined
in
a
footnote
again
wherever
as
in
the
case
of
julian
and
maddalo
there
has
appeared
to
be
good
reason
for
superseding
the
authority
of
the
editio
princeps
the
fact
is
announced
and
the
substituted
exemplar
indicated
in
the
prefatory
note
in
the
case
of
a
few
pieces
extant
in
two
or
more
versions
of
debatable
authority
the
alternative
text
or
texts
will
be
found
at
the
end
of
the
relevant
work
but
it
may
be
said
once
for
all
that
this
does
not
pretend
to
be
a
variorum
edition
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
term
the
textual
apparatus
does
not
claim
to
be
exhaustive
thus
i
have
not
thought
it
necessary
to
cumber
the
footnotes
with
every
minute
grammatical
correction
introduced
by
shelley
apparently
on
her
own
authority
into
the
texts
of
nor
has
it
come
within
the
scheme
of
this
edition
to
record
every
conjectural
emendation
adopted
or
proposed
by
rossetti
and
others
in
recent
times
but
it
is
hoped
that
up
to
and
including
the
editions
of
at
least
no
important
variation
of
the
text
has
been
overlooked
whenever
a
reading
has
been
adopted
on
manuscript
authority
a
reference
to
the
particular
source
has
been
added
below
i
have
been
chary
of
gratuitous
interference
with
the
punctuation
of
the
manuscripts
and
early
editions
in
this
direction
however
some
revision
was
indispensable
even
in
his
most
carefully
finished
fair
copy
shelley
thus
in
the
exquisite
autograph
hunt
of
julian
and
maddalo
buxton
forman
the
most
conservative
of
editors
finds
it
necessary
to
supplement
shelley
punctuation
in
no
fewer
than
places
and
sometimes
punctuates
capriciously
in
the
very
act
of
transcribing
his
mind
was
apt
to
stray
from
the
work
in
hand
to
higher
things
he
would
lose
himself
in
contemplating
those
airy
abstractions
and
lofty
visions
of
which
alone
he
greatly
cared
to
sing
to
the
neglect
and
detriment
of
the
merely
external
and
formal
element
of
his
song
shelley
recked
little
of
the
jots
and
tittles
of
literary
craftsmanship
he
committed
many
a
small
sin
against
the
rules
of
grammar
and
certainly
paid
but
a
halting
attention
to
the
nice
distinctions
of
punctuation
thus
in
the
early
editions
a
comma
occasionally
plays
the
part
of
a
semicolon
colons
and
semicolons
seem
to
be
employed
interchangeably
a
semicolon
almost
invariably
appears
where
nowadays
we
should
employ
the
dash
and
lastly
the
dash
itself
becomes
a
point
of
all
work
replacing
indifferently
commas
colons
semicolons
or
periods
inadequate
and
sometimes
haphazard
as
it
is
however
shelley
punctuation
so
far
as
it
goes
is
of
great
value
as
an
index
to
his
metrical
or
at
times
it
may
be
to
his
rhetorical
intention
for
in
hands
punctuation
serves
rather
to
mark
the
rhythmical
pause
and
onflow
of
the
verse
or
to
secure
some
declamatory
effect
than
to
indicate
the
structure
or
elucidate
the
sense
for
this
reason
the
original
pointing
has
been
retained
save
where
it
tends
to
obscure
or
pervert
the
poet
meaning
amongst
the
editor
notes
at
the
end
of
the
volume
the
reader
will
find
lists
of
the
punctual
variations
in
the
longer
poems
by
means
of
which
the
supplementary
points
now
added
may
be
identified
and
the
original
points
which
in
this
edition
have
been
deleted
or
else
replaced
by
others
ascertained
in
the
order
of
their
occurrence
in
the
use
of
capitals
shelley
practice
has
been
followed
while
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
reduce
the
number
of
his
inconsistencies
in
this
regard
to
have
reproduced
the
spelling
of
the
manuscripts
would
only
have
served
to
divert
attention
from
shelley
poetry
to
my
own
ingenuity
in
disgusting
the
reader
according
to
the
rules
of
editorial
punctilio
i
adapt
a
phrase
or
two
from
the
preface
to
the
revolt
of
islam
shelley
was
neither
very
accurate
nor
always
consistent
in
his
spelling
he
was
to
say
the
truth
indifferent
about
all
such
matters
indeed
to
one
absorbed
in
the
spectacle
of
a
world
travailing
for
lack
of
the
gospel
of
political
justice
the
study
of
orthographical
niceties
must
have
seemed
an
occupation
for
bedlamites
again
as
a
distinguished
critic
and
editor
of
shelley
professor
dowden
aptly
observes
in
this
connexion
great
poet
is
not
of
an
age
but
for
all
time
irregular
or
antiquated
forms
such
as
and
the
like
can
only
serve
to
distract
the
reader
attention
and
mar
his
enjoyment
of
the
verse
accordingly
shelley
eccentricities
in
this
kind
have
been
discarded
and
his
spelling
reversed
in
accordance
with
modern
usage
all
weak
whether
indicatives
or
participles
have
been
printed
with
ed
rather
than
t
participial
adjectives
and
substantives
such
as
alone
excepted
in
the
case
of
which
has
two
both
employed
by
shelley
see
for
an
example
of
the
longer
form
the
hymn
to
mercury
where
rhymes
with
line
the
shorter
form
rhyming
to
occurs
more
frequently
one
with
the
long
vowel
of
the
the
other
with
a
of
course
wherever
this
takes
place
whether
indicated
by
a
corresponding
change
in
the
spelling
or
not
t
not
ed
is
properly
used
etc
the
forms
discarded
under
the
general
rule
laid
down
above
are
such
as
etc
like
that
of
from
i
have
not
hesitated
to
print
the
longer
form
and
the
shorter
after
henry
sweet
example
in
order
clearly
to
indicate
the
pronunciation
intended
by
shelley
in
the
editions
the
two
are
confounded
under
the
one
spelling
in
a
few
cases
shelley
spelling
though
unusual
or
obsolete
has
been
retained
thus
in
and
one
or
two
more
words
the
ae
will
be
found
and
still
appears
as
shelley
seems
to
have
uniformly
written
here
the
word
is
so
printed
whenever
it
is
employed
as
a
trisyllable
elsewhere
the
ordinary
spelling
has
been
adopted
not
a
little
has
been
written
about
revolt
of
islam
which
has
been
described
as
a
deliberately
coined
by
shelley
no
better
warrant
than
the
exigency
of
the
rhyme
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
is
simply
an
overlooked
misprint
for
not
by
any
means
a
but
a
genuine
english
verbal
substantive
of
regular
formation
familiar
to
many
from
its
employment
by
chaucer
true
the
corresponding
in
the
passage
above
referred
to
are
but
a
laxity
such
as
is
quite
in
shelley
manner
thus
in
this
very
poem
we
find
kissed
shelley
may
have
first
seen
the
word
in
the
ancient
mariner
but
he
employs
it
more
correctly
than
coleridge
who
seems
to
have
mistaken
it
for
a
whereas
in
truth
it
serves
either
as
the
third
person
singular
of
the
present
or
as
here
for
the
verbal
substantive
the
editor
of
shelley
enters
upon
a
goodly
heritage
the
accumulated
gains
of
a
series
of
distinguished
predecessors
shelley
two
editions
of
form
the
nucleus
of
the
present
volume
and
her
notes
are
here
reprinted
in
full
but
the
arrangement
of
the
poems
differs
to
some
extent
from
that
followed
by
her
chiefly
in
respect
of
queen
mab
which
is
here
placed
at
the
head
of
the
juvenilia
instead
of
at
the
forefront
of
the
poems
of
maturity
in
a
slender
volume
of
poems
and
fragments
entitled
relics
of
shelley
was
published
by
richard
garnett
a
precious
sheaf
gleaned
from
the
manuscripts
preserved
at
boscombe
manor
the
relics
constitute
a
salvage
second
only
in
value
to
the
posthumous
poems
of
to
the
growing
mass
of
shelley
verse
yet
more
material
was
added
in
by
william
michael
rossetti
who
edited
for
moxon
the
complete
poetical
works
published
in
that
year
to
him
we
owe
in
particular
a
revised
and
greatly
enlarged
version
of
the
fragmentary
drama
of
charles
i
but
though
not
seldom
successful
in
restoring
the
text
rossetti
pushed
revision
beyond
the
bounds
of
prudence
freely
correcting
grammatical
errors
rectifying
small
inconsistencies
in
the
sense
and
too
lightly
adopting
conjectural
emendations
on
the
grounds
of
rhyme
or
metre
in
the
course
of
an
article
published
in
the
westminster
review
for
july
miss
mathilde
blind
with
the
aid
of
material
furnished
by
garnett
enabled
in
the
words
of

forman
supply
omissions

authoritative
emendations
and
controvert
erroneous
changes
in
rossetti
work
and
in
the
more
cautiously
edited
text
of
his
later
edition
published
by
moxon
in
may
be
traced
the
influence
of
her
strictures
six
years
later
appeared
a
variorum
edition
in
which
for
the
first
time
shelley
text
was
edited
with
scientific
exactness
of
method
and
with
a
due
respect
for
the
authority
of
the
original
editions
it
would
be
difficult
indeed
to
the
gains
which
have
accrued
to
the
lovers
of
shelley
from
the
strenuous
labours
of
harry
buxton
forman
he
too
has
enlarged
the
body
of
poetry
forman
most
notable
addition
is
the
second
part
of
the
daemon
of
the
world
which
he
printed
privately
in
and
included
in
his
library
edition
of
the
poetical
works
published
in
the
same
year
see
the
list
of
editions
etc
at
the
end
of
volume
but
important
as
his
editions
undoubtedly
are
it
may
safely
be
affirmed
that
his
services
in
this
direction
constitute
the
least
part
of
what
we
owe
him
he
has
vindicated
the
authenticity
of
the
text
in
many
places
while
in
many
others
he
has
succeeded
with
the
aid
of
manuscripts
in
restoring
it
his
untiring
industry
in
research
his
wide
bibliographical
knowledge
and
experience
above
all
his
accuracy
as
invariable
as
it
is
minute
have
combined
to
make
him
in
the
words
of
professor
dowden
chief
living
authority
on
all
that
relates
to
shelley
writings
his
name
stands
securely
linked
for
all
time
to
shelley
by
a
long
series
of
notable
words
including
three
successive
editions
of
the
poems
an
edition
of
the
prose
remains
as
well
as
many
minor
publications
a
bibliography
the
shelley
library
and
several
facsimile
reprints
of
the
early
issues
edited
for
the
shelley
society
to
professor
dowden
whose
authoritative
biography
of
the
poet
published
in
was
followed
in
by
an
edition
of
the
poems
macmillans
is
due
the
addition
of
several
pieces
belonging
to
the
juvenile
period
incorporated
by
him
in
the
pages
of
the
life
of
shelley
professor
dowden
has
also
been
enabled
with
the
aid
of
the
manuscripts
placed
in
his
hands
to
correct
the
text
of
the
juvenilia

many
places

professor
george
woodberry

a
centenary
edition
of
the
complete

quote
his
own
words
an
attempt
is
made
summarize
the
labours
of
more
than
half
a
century
on
shelley
text
and
on
his
biography
so
far
as
the
biography
is
bound
up
with
the
text

this
centenary
edition

textual
variations
found
in
the
harvard
college
manuscripts
as
well
as
those
in

belonging
to

of
brooklyn
are
fully
recorded
professor
text
is
conservative
on
the
whole
but
his
revision
of
the
punctuation
is
drastic
and
occasionally
sacrifices
melody
to
perspicuity

fruits
of

careful
scrutiny

can
not
do
better
than
quote
the
following
succinct
and
luminous
account
from
a
causerie

manuscripts
in
the
bodleian
library
contributed
by
richard
garnett
to
the
columns
of
the
speaker
of
december
the
textual
point
of
view
shelley
works
may
be
divided
into
three
classes
those
published
in
his
lifetime
under
his
own
direction
those
also
published
in
his
lifetime
but
in
his
absence
from
the
press
and
those
published
after
his
death
the
first
class
includes
queen
mab
the
revolt
of
islam
and
alastor
with
its
appendages
published
in
england
before
his
final
departure
for
the
continent
and
the
cenci
and
adonais
printed
under
his
own
eye
at
leghorn
and
pisa
respectively
except
for
some
provoking
but
corrigible
misprints
in
the
revolt
of
islam
and
one
crucial
passage
in
alastor
these
poems
afford
little
material
for
conjectural
emendation
for
the
alexandrines
now
and
then
left
in
the
middle
of
stanzas
in
the
revolt
of
islam
must
remain
untouched
as
proceeding
not
from
the
printer
carelessness
but
the
author
the
second
class
poems
printed
during
shelley
lifetime
but
not
under
his
immediate
inspection
comprise
prometheus
unbound
and
rosalind
and
helen
together
with
the
pieces
which
accompanied
them
epipsychidion
hellas
and
swellfoot
the
tyrant
the
correction
of
the
most
important
of
these
the
prometheus
was
the
least
satisfactory
shelley
though
speaking
plainly
to
the
publisher
rather
hints
than
expresses
his
dissatisfaction
when
writing
to
gisborne
the
corrector
but
there
is
a
pretty
clear
hint
when
on
a
subsequent
occasion
he
says
to
him
i
have
received
which
is
prettily
printed
and
with
fewer
mistakes
than
any
poem
i
ever
published
this
also
was
probably
not
without
influence
on
his
determination
to
have
the
cenci
and
adonais
printed
in
italy
of
the
third
class
of
shelley
writings
those
which
were
first
published
after
his
death
sufficient
facsimiles
have
been
published
to
prove
that
trelawny
graphic
description
of
the
chaotic
state
of
most
of
them
was
really
in
no
respect
exaggerated
the
difficulty
is
much
augmented
by
the
fact
that
these
pieces
are
rarely
consecutive
but
literally
disiecti
membra
poetae
scattered
through
various
notebooks
in
a
way
to
require
piecing
together
as
well
as
deciphering
the
editors
of
the
posthumous
poems
moreover
though
diligent
according
to
their
light
were
neither
endowed
with
remarkable
acumen
nor
possessed
of
the
wide
knowledge
requisite
for
the
full
intelligence
of
so
erudite
a
poet
as
shelley
hence
the
perpetration
of
numerous
mistakes
some
few
of
the
manuscripts
indeed
such
as
those
of
the
witch
of
atlas
julian
and
maddalo
and
the
lines
at
naples
were
beautifully
written
out
for
the
press
in
shelley
best
hand
but
their
very
value
and
beauty
necessitated
the
ordeal
of
transcription
with
disastrous
results
in
several
instances
an
entire
line
dropped
out
of
the
lines
at
naples
and
although
julian
and
maddalo
was
extant
in
more
than
one
very
clear
copy
the
printed
text
had
several
such
errors
as
least
for
lead
corrupt
state
of
the
text
has
stimulated
the
ingenuity
of
numerous
correctors
who
have
suggested
many
acute
and
convincing
emendations
and
some
very
specious
ones
which
sustained
scrutiny
has
proved
untenable
it
should
be
needless
to
remark
that
success
has
in
general
been
proportionate
to
the
facilities
of
access
to
the
manuscripts
which
have
only
of
late
become
generally
available
if
shelley
is
less
fortunate
than
most
modern
poets
in
the
purity
of
his
text
he
is
more
fortunate
than
many
in
the
preservation
of
his
manuscripts
these
have
not
as
regards
a
fair
proportion
been
destroyed
or
dispersed
at
auctions
but
were
protected
from
either
fate
by
their
very
character
as
confused
memoranda
as
such
they
remained
in
the
possession
of
shelley
widow
and
passed
from
her
to
her
son
and
after
sir
percy
shelley
death
lady
shelley
took
the
occasion
of
the
erection
of
the
monument
to
shelley
at
university
college
oxford
to
present
certain
of
the
manuscripts
to
the
bodleian
library
and
verse
and
sculpture
form
an
imperishable
memorial
of
his
connection
with
the
university
where
his
residence
was
so
brief
and
troubled
garnett
proceeds
most
important
of
the
bodleian
manuscripts
is
that
of
prometheus
unbound
which
says
locock
has
the
appearance
of
being
an
intermediate
draft
and
also
the
first
copy
made
this
should
confer
considerable
authority
on
its
variations
from
the
accepted
text
as
this
appears
to
have
been
printed
from
a
copy
not
made
by
shelley
himself
my
he
writes
to
ollier
on
september
is
now
being
transcribed
an
expression
which
he
would
hardly
have
used
if
he
had
himself
been
the
copyist
he
wished
the
proofs
to
be
sent
to
him
in
italy
for
correction
but
to
this
ollier
objected
and
on
may
shelley
signifies
his
acquiescence
adding
however
in
this
case
i
shall
repose
trust
in
your
care
respecting
the
correction
of
the
press
gisborne
will
revise
it
he
heard
it
recited
and
will
therefore
more
readily
seize
any
error
this
confidence
in
the
accuracy
of
gisborne
verbal
memory
is
touching
from
a
letter
to
gisborne
on
may
following
it
appears
that
the
offer
to
correct
came
from
him
and
that
shelley
sent
him
two
little
papers
of
corrections
and
additions
which
were
probably
made
use
of
or
the
fact
would
have
been
made
known
in
the
case
of
additions
this
may
satisfactorily
account
for
apparent
omissions
in
the
bodleian
manuscript
gisborne
after
all
did
not
prove
fully
up
to
the
mark
it
is
to
be
regretted
writes
shelley
to
ollier
on
november
that
the
errors
of
the
press
are
so
numerous
adding
i
shall
send
you
the
list
of
errata
in
a
day
or
two
this
was
probably
the
list
of
errata
written
by
shelley
himself
from
which
shelley
corrected
the
edition
of
in
placing
queen
mab
at
the
head
of
the
juvenilia
i
have
followed
the
arrangement
adopted
by
buxton
forman
in
his

edition
of

have
excluded
the

having
failed
to
satisfy
myself
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
grounds
on
which
in
certain
quarters
it
is
accepted
as
the
work
of

the
shorter
fragments
are
printed
as
in

of
along
with
the
miscellaneous
poems
of
the
years
to
which
they
severally
belong
under
titles
which
are
sometimes
borrowed
from
buxton
forman
sometimes
of
my
own
choosing
i
have
added
a
few
brief
editor
notes
mainly
on
textual
questions
at
the
end
of
the
book
of
the
poverty
of
my
work
in
this
direction
i
am
painfully
aware
but
in
the
present

the
ordinary
reader
will

find

and
if
this
be
so
the
principal

june
preface
by
shelley
to
first
collected
edition
obstacles
have
long
existed
to
my
presenting
the
public
with
a
perfect
edition
of
shelley
poems
these
being
at
last
happily
removed
i
hasten
to
fulfil
an
important
duty
that
of
giving
the
productions
of
a
sublime
genius
to
the
world
with
all
the
correctness
possible
and
of
at
the
same
time
detailing
the
history
of
those
productions
as
they
sprang
living
and
warm
from
his
heart
and
brain
i
abstain
from
any
remark
on
the
occurrences
of
his
private
life
except
inasmuch
as
the
passions
which
they
engendered
inspired
his
poetry
this
is
not
the
time
to
relate
the
truth
and
i
should
reject
any
colouring
of
the
truth
no
account
of
these
events
has
ever
been
given
at
all
approaching
reality
in
their
details
either
as
regards
himself
or
others
nor
shall
i
further
allude
to
them
than
to
remark
that
the
errors
of
action
committed
by
a
man
as
noble
and
generous
as
shelley
may
as
far
as
he
only
is
concerned
be
fearlessly
avowed
by
those
who
loved
him
in
the
firm
conviction
that
were
they
judged
impartially
his
character
would
stand
in
fairer
and
brighter
light
than
that
of
any
contemporary
whatever
faults
he
had
ought
to
find
extenuation
among
his
fellows
since
they
prove
him
to
be
human
without
them
the
exalted
nature
of
his
soul
would
have
raised
him
into
something
divine
the
qualities
that
struck
any
one
newly
introduced
to
shelley
were
first
a
gentle
and
cordial
goodness
that
animated
his
intercourse
with
warm
affection
and
helpful
sympathy
the
other
the
eagerness
and
ardour
with
which
he
was
attached
to
the
cause
of
human
happiness
and
improvement
and
the
fervent
eloquence
with
which
he
discussed
such
subjects
his
conversation
was
marked
by
its
happy
abundance
and
the
beautiful
language
in
which
he
clothed
his
poetic
ideas
and
philosophical
notions
to
defecate
life
of
its
misery
and
its
evil
was
the
ruling
passion
of
his
soul
he
dedicated
to
it
every
power
of
his
mind
every
pulsation
of
his
heart
he
looked
on
political
freedom
as
the
direct
agent
to
effect
the
happiness
of
mankind
and
thus
any
hope
of
liberty
inspired
a
joy
and
an
exultation
more
intense
and
wild
than
he
could
have
felt
for
any
personal
advantage
those
who
have
never
experienced
the
workings
of
passion
on
general
and
unselfish
subjects
can
not
understand
this
and
it
must
be
difficult
of
comprehension
to
the
younger
generation
rising
around
since
they
can
not
remember
the
scorn
and
hatred
with
which
the
partisans
of
reform
were
regarded
some
few
years
ago
nor
the
persecutions
to
which
they
were
exposed
he
had
been
from
youth
the
victim
of
the
state
of
feeling
inspired
by
the
reaction
of
the
french
revolution
and
believing
firmly
in
the
justice
and
excellence
of
his
views
it
can
not
be
wondered
that
a
nature
as
sensitive
as
impetuous
and
as
generous
as
his
should
put
its
whole
force
into
the
attempt
to
alleviate
for
others
the
evils
of
those
systems
from
which
he
had
himself
suffered
many
advantages
attended
his
birth
he
spurned
them
all
when
balanced
with
what
he
considered
his
duties
he
was
generous
to
imprudence
devoted
to
heroism
these
characteristics
breathe
throughout
his
poetry
the
struggle
for
human
weal
the
resolution
firm
to
martyrdom
the
impetuous
pursuit
the
glad
triumph
in
good
the
determination
not
to
despair
such
were
the
features
that
marked
those
of
his
works
which
he
regarded
with
most
complacency
as
sustained
by
a
lofty
subject
and
useful
aim
in
addition
to
these
his
poems
may
be
divided
into
two
classes
the
purely
imaginative
and
those
which
sprang
from
the
emotions
of
his
heart
among
the
former
may
be
classed
the
witch
of
atlas
adonais
and
his
latest
composition
left
imperfect
the
triumph
of
life
in
the
first
of
these
particularly
he
gave
the
reins
to
his
fancy
and
luxuriated
in
every
idea
as
it
rose
in
all
there
is
that
sense
of
mystery
which
formed
an
essential
portion
of
his
perception
of
life
a
clinging
to
the
subtler
inner
spirit
rather
than
to
the
outward
form
a
curious
and
metaphysical
anatomy
of
human
passion
and
perception
the
second
class
is
of
course
the
more
popular
as
appealing
at
once
to
emotions
common
to
us
all
some
of
these
rest
on
the
passion
of
love
others
on
grief
and
despondency
others
on
the
sentiments
inspired
by
natural
objects
shelley
conception
of
love
was
exalted
absorbing
allied
to
all
that
is
purest
and
noblest
in
our
nature
and
warmed
by
earnest
passion
such
it
appears
when
he
gave
it
a
voice
in
verse
yet
he
was
usually
averse
to
expressing
these
feelings
except
when
highly
idealized
and
many
of
his
more
beautiful
effusions
he
had
cast
aside
unfinished
and
they
were
never
seen
by
me
till
after
i
had
lost
him
others
as
for
instance
rosalind
and
helen
and
lines
written
among
the
euganean
hills
i
found
among
his
papers
by
chance
and
with
some
difficulty
urged
him
to
complete
them
there
are
others
such
as
the
ode
to
the
skylark
and
the
cloud
which
in
the
opinion
of
many
critics
bear
a
purer
poetical
stamp
than
any
other
of
his
productions
they
were
written
as
his
mind
prompted
listening
to
the
carolling
of
the
bird
aloft
in
the
azure
sky
of
italy
or
marking
the
cloud
as
it
sped
across
the
heavens
while
he
floated
in
his
boat
on
the
thames
no
poet
was
ever
warmed
by
a
more
genuine
and
unforced
inspiration
his
extreme
sensibility
gave
the
intensity
of
passion
to
his
intellectual
pursuits
and
rendered
his
mind
keenly
alive
to
every
perception
of
outward
objects
as
well
as
to
his
internal
sensations
such
a
gift
is
among
the
sad
vicissitudes
of
human
life
the
disappointments
we
meet
and
the
galling
sense
of
our
own
mistakes
and
errors
fraught
with
pain
to
escape
from
such
he
delivered
up
his
soul
to
poetry
and
felt
happy
when
he
sheltered
himself
from
the
influence
of
human
sympathies
in
the
wildest
regions
of
fancy
his
imagination
has
been
termed
too
brilliant
his
thoughts
too
subtle
he
loved
to
idealize
reality
and
this
is
a
taste
shared
by
few
we
are
willing
to
have
our
passing
whims
exalted
into
passions
for
this
gratifies
our
vanity
but
few
of
us
understand
or
sympathize
with
the
endeavour
to
ally
the
love
of
abstract
beauty
and
adoration
of
abstract
good
the
to
agathon
kai
to
kalon
of
the
socratic
philosophers
with
our
sympathies
with
our
kind
in
this
shelley
resembled
plato
both
taking
more
delight
in
the
abstract
and
the
ideal
than
in
the
special
and
tangible
this
did
not
result
from
imitation
for
it
was
not
till
shelley
resided
in
italy
that
he
made
plato
his
study
he
then
translated
his
symposium
and
his
ion
and
the
english
language
boasts
of
no
more
brilliant
composition
than
plato
praise
of
love
translated
by
shelley
to
return
to
his
own
poetry
the
luxury
of
imagination
which
sought
nothing
beyond
itself
as
a
child
burdens
itself
with
spring
flowers
thinking
of
no
use
beyond
the
enjoyment
of
gathering
them
often
showed
itself
in
his
verses
they
will
be
only
appreciated
by
minds
which
have
resemblance
to
his
own
and
the
mystic
subtlety
of
many
of
his
thoughts
will
share
the
same
fate
the
metaphysical
strain
that
characterizes
much
of
what
he
has
written
was
indeed
the
portion
of
his
works
to
which
apart
from
those
whose
scope
was
to
awaken
mankind
to
aspirations
for
what
he
considered
the
true
and
good
he
was
himself
particularly
attached
there
is
much
however
that
speaks
to
the
many
when
he
would
consent
to
dismiss
these
huntings
after
the
obscure
which
entwined
with
his
nature
as
they
were
he
did
with
difficulty
no
poet
ever
expressed
in
sweeter
more
or
more
passionate
verse
the
gentler
or
more
forcible
emotions
of
the
soul
a
wise
friend
once
wrote
to
shelley
are
still
very
young
and
in
certain
essential
respects
you
do
not
yet
sufficiently
perceive
that
you
are
so
it
is
seldom
that
the
young
know
what
youth
is
till
they
have
got
beyond
its
period
and
time
was
not
given
him
to
attain
this
knowledge
it
must
be
remembered
that
there
is
the
stamp
of
such
inexperience
on
all
he
wrote
he
had
not
completed
his
year
when
he
died
the
calm
of
middle
life
did
not
add
the
seal
of
the
virtues
which
adorn
maturity
to
those
generated
by
the
vehement
spirit
of
youth
through
life
also
he
was
a
martyr
to
and
constant
pain
wound
up
his
nerves
to
a
pitch
of
susceptibility
that
rendered
his
views
of
life
different
from
those
of
a
man
in
the
enjoyment
of
healthy
sensations
perfectly
gentle
and
forbearing
in
manner
he
suffered
a
good
deal
of
internal
irritability
or
rather
excitement
and
his
fortitude
to
bear
was
almost
always
on
the
stretch
and
thus
during
a
short
life
he
had
gone
through
more
experience
of
sensation
than
many
whose
existence
is
protracted
i
die
he
said
on
the
eve
of
his
unanticipated
death
have
lived
to
be
older
than
my
father
the
weight
of
thought
and
feeling
burdened
him
heavily
you
read
his
sufferings
in
his
attenuated
frame
while
you
perceived
the
mastery
he
held
over
them
in
his
animated
countenance
and
brilliant
eyes
he
died
and
the
world
showed
no
outward
sign
but
his
influence
over
mankind
though
slow
in
growth
is
fast
augmenting
and
in
the
ameliorations
that
have
taken
place
in
the
political
state
of
his
country
we
may
trace
in
part
the
operation
of
his
arduous
struggles
his
spirit
gathers
peace
in
its
new
state
from
the
sense
that
though
late
his
exertions
were
not
made
in
vain
and
in
the
progress
of
the
liberty
he
so
fondly
loved
he
died
and
his
place
among
those
who
knew
him
intimately
has
never
been
filled
up
he
walked
beside
them
like
a
spirit
of
good
to
comfort
and
benefit
to
enlighten
the
darkness
of
life
with
irradiations
of
genius
to
cheer
it
with
his
sympathy
and
love
any
one
once
attached
to
shelley
must
feel
all
other
affections
however
true
and
fond
as
wasted
on
barren
soil
in
comparison
it
is
our
best
consolation
to
know
that
such
a
and
exalted
being
was
once
among
us
and
now
exists
where
we
hope
one
day
to
join
him
although
the
intolerant
in
their
blindness
poured
down
anathemas
the
spirit
of
good
who
can
judge
the
heart
never
rejected
him
in
the
notes
appended
to
the
poems
i
have
endeavoured
to
narrate
the
origin
and
history
of
each
the
loss
of
nearly
all
letters
and
papers
which
refer
to
his
early
life
renders
the
execution
more
imperfect
than
it
would
otherwise
have
been
i
have
however
the
liveliest
recollection
of
all
that
was
done
and
said
during
the
period
of
my
knowing
him
every
impression
is
as
clear
as
if
stamped
yesterday
and
i
have
no
apprehension
of
any
mistake
in
my
statements
as
far
as
they
go
in
other
respects
i
am
indeed
incompetent
but
i
feel
the
importance
of
the
task
and
regard
it
as
my
most
sacred
duty
i
endeavour
to
fulfil
it
in
a
manner
he
would
himself
approve
and
hope
in
this
publication
to
lay
the
first
stone
of
a
monument
due
to
shelley
genius
his
sufferings
and
his
virtues

postscript
in
second
edition
of
in
revising
this
new
edition
and
carefully
consulting
scattered
and
confused
papers
i
found
a
few
fragments
which
had
hitherto
escaped
me
and
was
enabled
to
complete
a
few
poems
hitherto
left
unfinished
what
at
one
time
escapes
the
searching
eye
dimmed
by
its
own
earnestness
becomes
clear
at
a
future
period
by
the
aid
of
a
friend
i
also
present
some
poems
complete
and
correct
which
hitherto
have
been
defaced
by
various
mistakes
and
omissions
it
was
suggested
that
the
poem
to
the
queen
of
my
heart
was
falsely
attributed
to
shelley
i
certainly
find
no
trace
of
it
among
his
papers
and
as
those
of
his
intimate
friends
whom
i
have
consulted
never
heard
of
it
i
omit
it
two
poems
are
added
of
some
length
swellfoot
the
tyrant
and
peter
bell
the
third
i
have
mentioned
the
circumstances
under
which
they
were
written
in
the
notes
and
need
only
add
that
they
are
conceived
in
a
very
different
spirit
from
shelley
usual
compositions
they
are
specimens
of
the
burlesque
and
fanciful
but
although
they
adopt
a
familiar
style
and
homely
imagery
there
shine
through
the
radiance
of
the
poet
imagination
the
earnest
views
and
opinions
of
the
politician
and
the
moralist
at
my
request
the
publisher
has
restored
the
omitted
passages
of
queen
mab
i
now
present
this
edition
as
a
complete
collection
of
my
husband
poetical
works
and
i
do
not
foresee
that
i
can
hereafter
add
to
or
take
away
a

preface
by
shelley
to
the
volume
of
posthumous
poems
published
in
in
nobil
sangue
vita
umile
e
queta
ed
in
alto
intelletto
un
puro
core
frutto
senile
in
sul
giovenil
fibre
e
in
aspetto
pensoso
anima
petrarca
it
had
been
my
wish
on
presenting
the
public
with
the
posthumous
poems
of
shelley
to
have
accompanied
them
by
a
biographical
notice
as
it
appeared
to
me
that
at
this
moment
a
narration
of
the
events
of
my
husband
life
would
come
more
gracefully
from
other
hands
than
mine
i
applied
to
leigh
hunt
the
distinguished
friendship
that
shelley
felt
for
him
and
the
enthusiastic
affection
with
which
leigh
hunt
clings
to
his
friend
memory
seemed
to
point
him
out
as
the
person
best
calculated
for
such
an
undertaking
his
absence
from
this
country
which
prevented
our
mutual
explanation
has
unfortunately
rendered
my
scheme
abortive
i
do
not
doubt
but
that
on
some
other
occasion
he
will
pay
this
tribute
to
his
lost
friend
and
sincerely
regret
that
the
volume
which
i
edit
has
not
been
honoured
by
its
insertion
the
comparative
solitude
in
which
shelley
lived
was
the
occasion
that
he
was
personally
known
to
few
and
his
fearless
enthusiasm
in
the
cause
which
he
considered
the
most
sacred
upon
earth
the
improvement
of
the
moral
and
physical
state
of
mankind
was
the
chief
reason
why
he
like
other
illustrious
reformers
was
pursued
by
hatred
and
calumny
no
man
was
ever
more
devoted
than
he
to
the
endeavour
of
making
those
around
him
happy
no
man
ever
possessed
friends
more
unfeignedly
attached
to
him
the
ungrateful
world
did
not
feel
his
loss
and
the
gap
it
made
seemed
to
close
as
quickly
over
his
memory
as
the
murderous
sea
above
his
living
frame
hereafter
men
will
lament
that
his
transcendent
powers
of
intellect
were
extinguished
before
they
had
bestowed
on
them
their
choicest
treasures
to
his
friends
his
loss
is
irremediable
the
wise
the
brave
the
gentle
is
gone
for
ever
he
is
to
them
as
a
bright
vision
whose
radiant
track
left
behind
in
the
memory
is
worth
all
the
realities
that
society
can
afford
before
the
critics
contradict
me
let
them
appeal
to
any
one
who
had
ever
known
him
to
see
him
was
to
love
him
and
his
presence
like
ithuriel
spear
was
alone
sufficient
to
disclose
the
falsehood
of
the
tale
which
his
enemies
whispered
in
the
ear
of
the
ignorant
world
his
life
was
spent
in
the
contemplation
of
nature
in
arduous
study
or
in
acts
of
kindness
and
affection
he
was
an
elegant
scholar
and
a
profound
metaphysician
without
possessing
much
scientific
knowledge
he
was
unrivalled
in
the
justness
and
extent
of
his
observations
on
natural
objects
he
knew
every
plant
by
its
name
and
was
familiar
with
the
history
and
habits
of
every
production
of
the
earth
he
could
interpret
without
a
fault
each
appearance
in
the
sky
and
the
varied
phenomena
of
heaven
and
earth
filled
him
with
deep
emotion
he
made
his
study
and
of
the
shadowed
copse
the
stream
the
lake
and
the
waterfall
ill
health
and
continual
pain
preyed
upon
his
powers
and
the
solitude
in
which
we
lived
particularly
on
our
first
arrival
in
italy
although
congenial
to
his
feelings
must
frequently
have
weighed
upon
his
spirits
those
beautiful
and
affecting
lines
written
in
dejection
near
naples
were
composed
at
such
an
interval
but
when
in
health
his
spirits
were
buoyant
and
youthful
to
an
extraordinary
degree
such
was
his
love
for
nature
that
every
page
of
his
poetry
is
associated
in
the
minds
of
his
friends
with
the
loveliest
scenes
of
the
countries
which
he
inhabited
in
early
life
he
visited
the
most
beautiful
parts
of
this
country
and
ireland
afterwards
the
alps
of
switzerland
became
his
inspirers
prometheus
unbound
was
written
among
the
deserted
and
ruins
of
rome
and
when
he
made
his
home
under
the
pisan
hills
their
roofless
recesses
harboured
him
as
he
composed
the
witch
of
atlas
adonais
and
hellas
in
the
wild
but
beautiful
bay
of
spezzia
the
winds
and
waves
which
he
loved
became
his
playmates
his
days
were
chiefly
spent
on
the
water
the
management
of
his
boat
its
alterations
and
improvements
were
his
principal
occupation
at
night
when
the
unclouded
moon
shone
on
the
calm
sea
he
often
went
alone
in
his
little
shallop
to
the
rocky
caves
that
bordered
it
and
sitting
beneath
their
shelter
wrote
the
triumph
of
life
the
last
of
his
productions
the
beauty
but
strangeness
of
this
lonely
place
the
refined
pleasure
which
he
felt
in
the
companionship
of
a
few
selected
friends
our
entire
sequestration
from
the
rest
of
the
world
all
contributed
to
render
this
period
of
his
life
one
of
continued
enjoyment
i
am
convinced
that
the
two
months
we
passed
there
were
the
happiest
which
he
had
ever
known
his
health
even
rapidly
improved
and
he
was
never
better
than
when
i
last
saw
him
full
of
spirits
and
joy
embark
for
leghorn
that
he
might
there
welcome
leigh
hunt
to
italy
i
was
to
have
accompanied
him
but
illness
confined
me
to
my
room
and
thus
put
the
seal
on
my
misfortune
his
vessel
bore
out
of
sight
with
a
favourable
wind
and
i
remained
awaiting
his
return
by
the
breakers
of
that
sea
which
was
about
to
engulf
him
he
spent
a
week
at
pisa
employed
in
kind
offices
toward
his
friend
and
enjoying
with
keen
delight
the
renewal
of
their
intercourse
he
then
embarked
with
williams
the
chosen
and
beloved
sharer
of
his
pleasures
and
of
his
fate
to
return
to
us
we
waited
for
them
in
vain
the
sea
by
its
restless
moaning
seemed
to
desire
to
inform
us
of
what
we
would
not
learn
but
a
veil
may
well
be
drawn
over
such
misery
the
real
anguish
of
those
moments
transcended
all
the
fictions
that
the
most
glowing
imagination
ever
portrayed
our
seclusion
the
savage
nature
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
surrounding
villages
and
our
immediate
vicinity
to
the
troubled
sea
combined
to
imbue
with
strange
horror
our
days
of
uncertainty
the
truth
was
at
last
known
a
truth
that
made
our
loved
and
lovely
italy
appear
a
tomb
its
sky
a
pall
every
heart
echoed
the
deep
lament
and
my
only
consolation
was
in
the
praise
and
earnest
love
that
each
voice
bestowed
and
each
countenance
demonstrated
for
him
we
had
lost
not
i
fondly
hope
for
ever
his
unearthly
and
elevated
nature
is
a
pledge
of
the
continuation
of
his
being
although
in
an
altered
form
rome
received
his
ashes
they
are
deposited
beneath
its
wall
and
world
sole
is
enriched
by
his
remains
i
must
add
a
few
words
concerning
the
contents
of
this
volume
julian
and
maddalo
the
witch
of
atlas
and
most
of
the
translations
were
written
some
years
ago
and
with
the
exception
of
the
cyclops
and
the
scenes
from
the
magico
prodigioso
may
be
considered
as
having
received
the
author
ultimate
corrections
the
triumph
of
life
was
his
last
work
and
was
left
in
so
unfinished
a
state
that
i
arranged
it
in
its
present
form
with
great
difficulty
all
his
poems
which
were
scattered
in
periodical
works
are
collected
in
this
volume
and
i
have
added
a
reprint
of
alastor
or
the
spirit
of
solitude
the
difficulty
with
which
a
copy
can
be
obtained
is
the
cause
of
its
republication
many
of
the
miscellaneous
poems
written
on
the
spur
of
the
occasion
and
never
retouched
i
found
among
his
manuscript
books
and
have
carefully
copied
i
have
subjoined
whenever
i
have
been
able
the
date
of
their
composition
i
do
not
know
whether
the
critics
will
reprehend
the
insertion
of
some
of
the
most
imperfect
among
them
but
i
frankly
own
that
i
have
been
more
actuated
by
the
fear
lest
any
monument
of
his
genius
should
escape
me
than
the
wish
of
presenting
nothing
but
what
was
complete
to
the
fastidious
reader
i
feel
secure
that
the
lovers
of
poetry
who
know
how
more
than
any
poet
of
the
present
day
every
line
and
word
he
wrote
is
instinct
with
peculiar
beauty
will
pardon
and
thank
me
i
consecrate
this
volume
to
them
the
size
of
this
collection
has
prevented
the
insertion
of
any
prose

might
moralize

that

coy

repose

they
when

through

the
broad
moon

weary
night
without

her
dewy
eyes
are
closed
on
their
translucent
lids
whose
texture
fine
scarce
hides
the

pillowed

twining
like
tendrils
of
the
parasite
around
a
marble
column

whence
that
rushing
sound
is
like
a
wondrous
strain
that
sweeps
around
a
lonely
ruin
when
west
winds
sigh
and
evening
waves
respond
in
whispers
from
the
shore
wilder
than
the
unmeasured
notes
which
from
the
unseen
lyres
of
dells
and
groves
the
genii
of
the
breezes
sweep
floating
on
waves
of
music
and
of
light
the
chariot
of
the
daemon
of
the
world
descends
in
silent
power
its
shape
reposed
within
slight
as
some
cloud
that
catches
but
the
palest
tinge
of
day
when
evening
yields
to
night
bright
as
that
fibrous
woof
when
stars
indue
its
transitory
robe

shapeless
shadows

hung
like

atmosphere
in
flaming
sparkles
flew
and
where
the
burning
wheels
eddied
above
the
mountain
loftiest
peak
was
traced
a
line
of
lightning
now
far
above
a
rock
the
utmost
verge
of
the
wide
earth
it
flew
the
rival
of
the
andes
whose
dark
brow
frowned
the
silver
sea
far
far
below
the
chariot
stormy
path
calm
as
a
slumbering
babe
tremendous
ocean
lay
its
broad
and
silent
mirror
gave
to
view
the
pale
and
waning
stars
the
chariot
fiery
track
and
the
grey
light
of
morn
tingeing
those
fleecy
clouds
that
cradled
in
their
folds
the
infant
dawn
the
chariot
seemed
to
fly
through
the
abyss
of
an
immense
concave
radiant
with
million
constellations
tinged
with
shades
of
infinite
colour
and
semicircled
with
a
belt
flashing
incessant
meteors
as
they
approached
their
goal
the
winged
shadows
seemed
to
gather
speed
the
sea
no
longer
was
distinguished
earth
appeared
a
vast
and
shadowy
sphere
suspended
in
the
black
concave
of
heaven
with
the
sun
cloudless
orb
whose
rays
of
rapid
light
parted
around
the
chariot
swifter
course
and
fell
like
ocean
feathery
spray
dashed
from
the
boiling
surge
before
a
vessel
prow
the
magic
car
moved
on
earth
distant
orb
appeared
the
smallest
light
that
twinkles
in
the
heavens
whilst
round
the
chariot
way
innumerable
systems
widely
rolled
and
countless
spheres
diffused
an
ever
varying
glory
it
was
a
sight
of
wonder
some
were
horned
and
like
the
moon
argentine
crescent
hung
in
the
dark
dome
of
heaven
some
did
shed
a
clear
mild
beam
like
hesperus
while
the
sea
yet
glows
with
fading
sunlight
others
dashed
athwart
the
night
with
trains
of
bickering
fire
like
sphered
worlds
to
death
and
ruin
driven
some
shone
like
stars
and
as
the
chariot
passed
bedimmed
all
other
light
spirit
of
nature
here
in
this
interminable
wilderness
of
worlds
at
whose
involved
immensity
even
soaring
fancy
staggers
here
is
thy
fitting
temple
yet
not
the
lightest
leaf
that
quivers
to
the
passing
breeze
is
less
instinct
with
thee
yet
not
the
meanest
worm
that
lurks
in
graves
and
fattens
on
the
dead
less
shares
thy
eternal
breath
spirit
of
nature
thou
imperishable
as
this
glorious
scene
here
is
thy
fitting
temple
if
solitude
hath
ever
led
thy
steps
to
the
shore
of
the
immeasurable
sea
and
thou
hast
lingered
there
until
the
sun
broad
orb
seemed
resting
on
the
fiery
line
of
ocean
thou
must
have
marked
the
braided
webs
of
gold
that
without
motion
hang
over
the
sinking
sphere
thou
must
have
marked
the
billowy
mountain
clouds
edged
with
intolerable
radiancy
towering
like
rocks
of
jet
above
the
burning
deep
and
yet
there
is
a
moment
when
the
sun
highest
point
peers
like
a
star
ocean
western
edge
when
those
far
clouds
of
feathery
purple
gleam
like
fairy
lands
girt
by
some
heavenly
sea
then
has
thy
rapt
imagination
soared
where
in
the
midst
of
all
existing
things
the
temple
of
the
mightiest
daemon
stands
yet
not
the
golden
islands
that
gleam
amid
yon
flood
of
purple
light
nor
the
feathery
curtains
that
canopy
the
sun
resplendent
couch
nor
the
burnished
ocean
waves
paving
that
gorgeous
dome
so
fair
so
wonderful
a
sight
as
the
eternal
temple
could
afford
the
elements
of
all
that
human
thought
can
frame
of
lovely
or
sublime
did
join
to
rear
the
fabric
of
the
fane
nor
aught
of
earth
may
image
forth
its
majesty
yet
likest
evening
vault
that
faery
hall
as
heaven
low
resting
on
the
wave
it
spread
its
floors
of
flashing
light
its
vast
and
azure
dome
and
on
the
verge
of
that
obscure
abyss
where
crystal
battlements
the
gulf
of
the
dark
world
ten
thousand
spheres
diffuse
their
lustre
through
its
adamantine
gates
the
magic
car
no
longer
moved
the
daemon
and
the
spirit
entered
the
eternal
gates
those
clouds
of
aery
gold
that
slept
in
glittering
billows
beneath
the
azure
canopy
with
the
ethereal
footsteps
trembled
not
while
slight
and
odorous
mists
floated
to
strains
of
thrilling
melody
through
the
vast
columns
and
the
pearly
shrines
the
daemon
and
the
spirit
approached
the
overhanging
battlement
below
lay
stretched
the
boundless
universe
there
far
as
the
remotest
line
that
limits
swift
imagination
flight
unending
orbs
mingled
in
mazy
motion
immutably
fulfilling
eternal
nature
law
above
below
around
the
circling
systems
formed
a
wilderness
of
harmony
each
with
undeviating
aim
in
eloquent
silence
through
the
depths
of
space
pursued
its
wondrous
awhile
the
spirit
paused
in
ecstasy
yet
soon
she
saw
as
the
vast
spheres
swept
by
strange
things
within
their
belted
orbs
appear
like
animated
frenzies
dimly
moved
shadows
and
skeletons
and
fiendly
shapes
thronging
round
human
graves
and
the
dead
sculpturing
records
for
each
memory
in
verse
such
as
malignant
gods
pronounce
blasting
the
hopes
of
men
when
heaven
and
hell
confounded
burst
in
ruin
the
world
and
they
did
build
vast
trophies
instruments
of
murder
human
bones
barbaric
gold
skins
torn
from
living
men
and
towers
of
skulls
with
sightless
holes
gazing
on
blinder
heaven
mitres
and
crowns
and
brazen
chariots
stained
with
blood
and
scrolls
of
mystic
wickedness
the
sanguine
codes
of
venerable
crime
the
likeness
of
a
throned
king
came
by
when
these
had
passed
bearing
upon
his
brow
a
threefold
crown
his
countenance
was
calm
his
eye
severe
and
cold
but
his
right
hand
was
charged
with
bloody
coin
and
he
did
gnaw
by
fits
with
secret
smiles
a
human
heart
concealed
beneath
his
robe
and
motley
shapes
a
multitudinous
throng
around
him
knelt
with
bosoms
bare
and
bowed
heads
and
false
looks
of
true
submission
as
the
sphere
rolled
by
brooking
no
eye
to
witness
their
foul
shame
which
human
hearts
must
feel
while
human
tongues
tremble
to
speak
they
did
rage
horribly
breathing
in
fierce
blasphemies
against
the
daemon
of
the
world
and
high
hurling
their
armed
hands
where
the
pure
spirit
serene
and

secure
stood

thee

entwined
those

thy
glorious

the
spirit
saw
the
vast
frame
of
the
renovated
world
smile
in
the
lap
of
chaos
and
the
sense
of
hope
thro
her
fine
texture
did
suffuse
such
varying
glow
as
summer
evening
casts
on
undulating
clouds
and
deepening
lakes
like
the
vague
sighings
of
a
wind
at
even
that
wakes
the
wavelets
of
the
slumbering
sea
and
dies
on
the
creation
of
its
breath
and
sinks
and
rises
fails
and
swells
by

the
sweet
stream
of

that
with
wild
motion
flowed
the
spirit
human

the
mighty
tide
of

paused

from

the

renew

the
flame
of
consentaneous
love
inspires
all

the

suck
to
myriads
who

no

deform
the
beaming
brow
of
heaven
nor
scatter
in
the
freshness
of
its
pride
the
foliage
of
the
undecaying
trees

ripe
flowers
ever
fair

autumn
proudly
bears
her
matron
grace

flush
on

bloom
beneath

its
tint

blushes
into

habitable
earth
is
full
of
bliss
those
wastes
of
frozen
billows
that
were
hurled
by
everlasting
round
the
poles
where
matter
dared
not
vegetate
nor
live
but
ceaseless
frost
round
the
vast
solitude
bound
its
broad
zone
of
stillness
are
unloosed
and
fragrant
zephyrs
there
from
spicy
isles
ruffle
the
placid
that
rolls
its
broad
bright
surges
to
the
sloping
sand
whose
roar
is
wakened
into
echoings
sweet
to
murmur
through
the
groves
and
melodise
with
man
blest
nature
there
the
vast
tract
of
the
parched
and
sandy
waste
now
teems
with
countless
rills
and
shady
woods
and
pastures
and
white
cottages
and
where
the
startled
wilderness
did
hear
a
savage
conqueror
stained
in
kindred
blood
hymmng
his
victory
or
the
milder
snake
crushing
the
bones
of
some
frail
antelope
within
his
brazen
folds
the
dewy
lawn
offering
sweet
incense
to
the
sunrise
smiles
to
see
a
babe
before
his
mother
door
share
with
the
green
and
golden
basilisk
that
comes
to
lick
his
feet
his
morning
meal
those
trackless
deeps
where
many
a
weary
sail
has
seen
above
the
illimitable
plain
morning
on
night
and
night
on
morning
rise
whilst
still
no
land
to
greet
the
wanderer
spread
its
shadowy
mountains
on
the
sunbright
sea
where
the
loud
roarings
of
the
so
long
have
mingled
with
the
gusty
wind
in
melancholy
loneliness
and
swept
the
desert
of
those
ocean
solitudes
but
vocal
to
the
harrowing
shriek
the
bellowing
monster
and
the
rushing
storm
now
to
the
sweet
and
sounds
of
kindliest
human
impulses
respond
those
lonely
realms
bright
begem
with
lightsome
clouds
and
shining
seas
between
and
fertile
valleys
resonant
with
bliss
whilst
green
woods
overcanopy
the
wave
which
like
a
labourer
leaps
to
shore
to
meet
the
kisses
of
the
flowerets
there
man
chief
perceives
the
change
his
being
notes
the
gradual
renovation
and
defines
each
movement
of
its
progress
on
his
mind
man
where
the
gloom
of
the
long
polar
night
lowered
the
rocks
and
frozen
soil
where
scarce
the
hardiest
herb
that
braves
the
frost
basked
in
the
moonlight
ineffectual
glow
shrank
with
the
plants
and
darkened
with
the
night
nor
where
the
tropics
bound
the
realms
of
day
with
a
broad
belt
of
mingling
cloud
and
flame
where
blue
mists
through
the
unmoving
atmosphere
scattered
the
seeds
of
pestilence
and
fed
unnatural
vegetation
where
the
land
teemed
with
all
earthquake
tempest
and
disease
was
man
a
nobler
being
slavery
had
crushed
him
to
his
country
dust
even
where
the
milder
zone
afforded
man
a
seeming
shelter
yet
contagion
there
blighting
his
being
with
unnumbered
ills
spread
like
a
quenchless
fire
nor
truth
availed
till
late
to
arrest
its
progress
or
create
that
peace
which
first
in
bloodless
victory
waved
her
snowy
standard
this
favoured
clime
there
man
was
long
the
of
slaves
the
mimic
of
surrounding
misery
the
jackal
of
ambition
the
bloodhound
of
religion
hungry
zeal
here
now
the
human
being
stands
adorning
this
loveliest
earth
with
taintless
body
and
mind
blest
from
his
birth
with
all
bland
impulses
which
gently
in
his
noble
bosom
wake
all
kindly
passions
and
all
pure
desires
him
still
from
hope
to
hope
the
bliss
pursuing
which
from
the
exhaustless
lore
of
human
weal
dawns
on
the
virtuous
mind
the
thoughts
that
rise
in
infiniteness
gift
with
eternity
that
mocks
the
unprevailing
hoariness
of
age
and
man
once
fleeting
the
transient
scene
swift
as
an
unremembered
vision
stands
immortal
upon
earth
no
longer
now
he
slays
the
beast
that
sports
around
his
dwelling
and
horribly
devours
its
mangled
flesh
or
drinks
its
vital
blood
which
like
a
stream
of
poison
thro
his
fevered
veins
did
flow
feeding
a
plague
that
secretly
consumed
his
feeble
frame
and
kindling
in
his
mind
hatred
despair
and
fear
and
vain
belief
the
germs
of
misery
death
disease
and
crime
no
longer
now
the
winged
habitants
that
in
the
woods
their
sweet
lives
sing
away
flee
from
the
form
of
man
but
gather
round
and
prune
their
sunny
feathers
on
the
hands
which
little
children
stretch
in
friendly
sport
towards
these
dreadless
partners
of
their
play
all
things
are
void
of
terror
man
has
lost
his
desolating
privilege
and
stands
an
equal
amidst
equals
happiness
and
science
dawn
though
late
upon
the
earth
peace
cheers
the
mind
health
renovates
the
frame
disease
and
pleasure
cease
to
mingle
here
reason
and
passion
cease
to
combat
there
whilst
mind
unfettered
the
earth
extends
its
energies
and
wields
the
sceptre
of
a
vast
dominion
there
mild
is
the
slow
necessity
of
death
the
tranquil
spirit
fails
beneath
its
grasp
without
a
groan
almost
without
a
fear
resigned
in
peace
to
the
necessity
calm
as
a
voyager
to
some
distant
land
and
full
of
wonder
full
of
hope
as
he
the
deadly
germs
of
languor
and
disease
waste
in
the
human
frame
and
nature
gifts
with
choicest
boons
her
human
worshippers
how
vigorous
now
the
athletic
form
of
age
how
clear
its
open
and
unwrinkled
brow
where
neither
avarice
cunning
pride
or
care
had
stamped
the
seal
of
grey
deformity
on
all
the
mingling
lineaments
of
time
how
lovely
the
intrepid
front
of
youth
how
sweet
the
smiles
of
taintless
infancy
within
the
massy
prison
mouldering
courts
fearless
and
free
the
ruddy
children
play
weaving
gay
chaplets
for
their
innocent
brows
with
the
green
ivy
and
the
red
that
mock
the
dungeon
unavailing
gloom
the
ponderous
chains
and
gratings
of
strong
iron
there
rust
amid
the
accumulated
ruins
now
mingling
slowly
with
their
native
earth
there
the
broad
beam
of
day
which
feebly
once
lighted
the
cheek
of
lean
captivity
with
a
pale
and
sickly
glare
now
freely
shines
on
the
pure
smiles
of
infant
playfulness
no
more
the
shuddering
voice
of
hoarse
despair
peals
through
the
echoing
vaults
but
soothing
notes
of
winds
and
gladsome
birds
and
merriment
are
resonant
around
the
fanes
of
fear
and
falsehood
hear
no
more
the
voice
that
once
waked
multitudes
to
war
thundering
thro
all
their
aisles
but
now
respond
to
the
death
dirge
of
the
melancholy
wind
it
were
a
sight
of
awfulness
to
see
the
works
of
faith
and
slavery
so
vast
so
sumptuous
yet
withal
so
perishing
even
as
the
corpse
that
rests
beneath
their
wall
a
thousand
mourners
deck
the
pomp
of
death
the
breathing
marble
glows
above
to
decorate
its
memory
and
tongues
are
busy
of
its
life
worms
in
silence
and
in
darkness
seize
their
prey
these
ruins
soon
leave
not
a
wreck
behind
their
elements
the
globe
to
happier
shapes
are
moulded
and
become
ministrant
to
all
blissful
impulses
thus
human
things
are
perfected
and
earth
even
as
a
child
beneath
its
mother
love
is
strengthened
in
all
excellence
and
grows
fairer
and
nobler
with
each
passing
year
now
time
his
dusky
pennons
the
scene
closes
in

let

teach
thee

and
that

whose

its

the

of
all

is

there
that

the

the

preface
the
poem
entitled
alastor
may
be
considered
as
allegorical
of
one
of
the
most
interesting
situations
of
the
human
mind
it
represents
a
youth
of
uncorrupted
feelings
and
adventurous
genius
led
forth
by
an
imagination
inflamed
and
purified
through
familiarity
with
all
that
is
excellent
and
majestic
to
the
contemplation
of
the
universe
he
drinks
deep
of
the
fountains
of
knowledge
and
is
still
insatiate
the
magnificence
and
beauty
of
the
external
world
sinks
profoundly
into
the
frame
of
his
conceptions
and
affords
to
their
modifications
at
variety
not
to
be
exhausted
so
long
as
it
is
possible
for
his
desires
to
point
towards
objects
thus
infinite
and
unmeasured
he
is
joyous
and
tranquil
and
but
the
period
arrives
when
these
objects
cease
to
suffice
his
mind
is
at
length
suddenly
awakened
and
thirsts
for
intercourse
with
an
intelligence
similar
to
itself
he
images
to
himself
the
being
whom
he
loves
conversant
with
speculations
of
the
sublimest
and
most
perfect
natures
the
vision
in
which
he
embodies
his
own
imaginations
unites
all
of
wonderful
or
wise
or
beautiful
which
the
poet
the
philosopher
or
the
lover
could
depicture
the
intellectual
faculties
the
imagination
the
functions
of
sense
have
their
respective
requisitions
on
the
sympathy
of
corresponding
powers
in
other
human
beings
the
poet
is
represented
as
uniting
these
requisitions
and
attaching
them
to
a
single
image
he
seeks
in
vain
for
a
prototype
of
his
conception
blasted
by
his
disappointment
he
descends
to
an
untimely
grave
the
picture
is
not
barren
of
instruction
to
actual
men
the
seclusion
was
avenged
by
the
furies
of
an
irresistible
passion
pursuing
him
to
speedy
ruin
but
that
power
which
strikes
the
luminaries
of
the
world
with
sudden
darkness
and
extinction
by
awakening
them
to
too
exquisite
a
perception
of
its
influences
dooms
to
a
slow
and
poisonous
decay
those
manner
spirits
that
dare
to
abjure
its
dominion
their
destiny
is
more
abject
and
inglorious
as
their
delinquency
is
more
contemptible
and
pernicious
they
who
deluded
by
no
generous
error
instigated
by
no
sacred
thirst
of
doubtful
knowledge
duped
by
no
illustrious
superstition
loving
nothing
on
this
earth
and
cherishing
no
hopes
beyond
yet
keep
aloof
from
sympathies
with
their
kind
rejoicing
neither
in
human
joy
nor
mourning
with
human
grief
these
and
such
as
they
have
their
apportioned
curse
they
languish
because
none
feel
with
them
their
common
nature
they
are
morally
dead
they
are
neither
friends
nor
lovers
nor
fathers
nor
citizens
of
the
world
nor
benefactors
of
their
country
among
those
who
attempt
to
exist
without
human
sympathy
the
pure
and
perish
through
the
intensity
and
passion
of
their
search
after
its
communities
when
the
vacancy
of
their
spirit
suddenly
makes
itself
felt
all
else
selfish
blind
and
torpid
are
those
unforeseeing
multitudes
who
constitute
together
with
their
own
the
lasting
misery
and
loneliness
of
the
world
those
who
love
not
their
live
unfruitful
lives
and
prepare
for
their
old
age
a
miserable
grave
good
die
first
and
those
whose
hearts
are
dry
as
summer
dust
burn
to
the
socket
december
alastor
or
the
spirit
of
solitude
earth
ocean
air
beloved
brotherhood
if
our
great
mother
has
imbued
my
soul
with
aught
of
natural
piety
to
feel
your
love
and
recompense
the
boon
with
mine
if
dewy
morn
and
odorous
noon
and
even
with
sunset
and
its
gorgeous
ministers
and
solemn
midnight
tingling
silentness
if
autumn
hollow
sighs
in
the
sere
wood
and
winter
robing
with
pure
snow
and
crowns
of
starry
ice
the
grey
grass
and
bare
boughs
if
spring
voluptuous
pantings
when
she
breathes
her
first
sweet
kisses
have
been
dear
to
me
if
no
bright
bird
insect
or
gentle
beast
i
consciously
have
injured
but
still
loved
and
cherished
these
my
kindred
then
forgive
this
boast
beloved
brethren
and
withdraw
no
portion
of
your
wonted
favour
now
mother
of
this
unfathomable
world
favour
my
solemn
song
for
i
have
loved
thee
ever
and
thee
only
i
have
watched
thy
shadow
and
the
darkness
of
thy
steps
and
my
heart
ever
gazes
on
the
depth
of
thy
deep
mysteries
i
have
made
my
bed
in
charnels
and
on
coffins
where
black
death
keeps
record
of
the
trophies
won
from
thee
hoping
to
still
these
obstinate
questionings
of
thee
and
thine
by
forcing
some
lone
ghost
thy
messenger
to
render
up
the
tale
of
what
we
are
in
lone
and
silent
hours
when
night
makes
a
weird
sound
of
its
own
stillness
like
an
inspired
and
desperate
alchymist
staking
his
very
life
on
some
dark
hope
have
i
mixed
awful
talk
and
asking
looks
with
my
most
innocent
love
until
strange
tears
uniting
with
those
breathless
kisses
made
such
magic
as
compels
the
charmed
night
to
render
up
thy
charge
and
though
yet
thou
hast
unveiled
thy
inmost
sanctuary
enough
from
incommunicable
dream
and
twilight
phantasms
and
deep
thought
has
shone
within
me
that
serenely
now
and
moveless
as
a
lyre
suspended
in
the
solitary
dome
of
some
mysterious
and
deserted
fane
i
wait
thy
breath
great
parent
that
my
strain
may
modulate
with
murmurs
of
the
air
and
motions
of
the
forests
and
the
sea
and
voice
of
living
beings
and
woven
hymns
of
night
and
day
and
the
deep
heart
of
man
there
was
a
poet
whose
untimely
tomb
no
human
hands
with
pious
reverence
reared
but
the
charmed
eddies
of
autumnal
winds
built
his
mouldering
bones
a
pyramid
of
mouldering
leaves
in
the
waste
wilderness
a
lovely
youth
no
mourning
maiden
decked
with
weeping
flowers
or
votive
cypress
wreath
the
lone
couch
of
his
everlasting
sleep
gentle
and
brave
and
generous
no
lorn
bard
breathed
his
dark
fate
one
melodious
sigh
he
lived
he
died
he
sung
in
solitude
strangers
have
wept
to
hear
his
passionate
notes
and
virgins
as
unknown
he
passed
have
pined
and
wasted
for
fond
love
of
his
wild
eyes
the
fire
of
those
soft
orbs
has
ceased
to
burn
and
silence
too
enamoured
of
that
voice
locks
its
mute
music
in
her
rugged
cell
by
solemn
vision
and
bright
silver
dream
his
infancy
was
nurtured
every
sight
and
sound
from
the
vast
earth
and
ambient
air
sent
to
his
heart
its
choicest
impulses
the
fountains
of
divine
philosophy
fled
not
his
thirsting
lips
and
all
of
great
or
good
or
lovely
which
the
sacred
past
in
truth
or
fable
consecrates
he
felt
and
knew
when
early
youth
had
passed
he
left
his
cold
fireside
and
alienated
home
to
seek
strange
truths
in
undiscovered
lands
many
a
wide
waste
and
tangled
wilderness
has
lured
his
fearless
steps
and
he
has
bought
with
his
sweet
voice
and
eyes
from
savage
men
his
rest
and
food
nature
most
secret
steps
he
like
her
shadow
has
pursued
the
red
volcano
overcanopies
its
fields
of
snow
and
pinnacles
of
ice
with
burning
smoke
or
where
bitumen
lakes
on
black
bare
pointed
islets
ever
beat
with
sluggish
surge
or
where
the
secret
caves
rugged
and
dark
winding
among
the
springs
of
fire
and
poison
inaccessible
to
avarice
or
pride
their
starry
domes
of
diamond
and
of
gold
expand
above
numberless
and
immeasurable
halls
frequent
with
crystal
column
and
clear
shrines
of
pearl
and
thrones
radiant
with
chrysolite
nor
had
that
scene
of
ampler
majesty
than
gems
or
gold
the
varying
roof
of
heaven
and
the
green
earth
lost
in
his
heart
its
claims
to
love
and
wonder
he
would
linger
long
in
lonesome
vales
making
the
wild
his
home
until
the
doves
and
squirrels
would
partake
from
his
innocuous
hand
his
bloodless
food
lured
by
the
gentle
meaning
of
his
looks
and
the
wild
antelope
that
starts
the
dry
leaf
rustles
in
the
brake
suspend
her
timid
steps
to
gaze
upon
a
form
more
graceful
than
her
own
his
wandering
step
obedient
to
high
thoughts
has
visited
the
awful
ruins
of
the
days
of
old
athens
and
tyre
and
balbec
and
the
waste
where
stood
jerusalem
the
fallen
towers
of
babylon
the
eternal
pyramids
memphis
and
thebes
and
of
strange
sculptured
on
alabaster
obelisk
or
jasper
tomb
or
mutilated
sphynx
dark
aethiopia
in
her
desert
hills
conceals
among
the
ruined
temples
there
stupendous
columns
and
wild
images
of
more
than
man
where
marble
daemons
watch
the
zodiac
brazen
mystery
and
dead
men
hang
their
mute
thoughts
on
the
mute
walls
around
he
lingered
poring
on
memorials
of
the
world
youth
through
the
long
burning
day
gazed
on
those
speechless
shapes
nor
when
the
moon
filled
the
mysterious
halls
with
floating
shades
suspended
he
that
task
but
ever
gazed
and
gazed
till
meaning
on
his
vacant
mind
flashed
like
strong
inspiration
and
he
saw
the
thrilling
secrets
of
the
birth
of
time
meanwhile
an
arab
maiden
brought
his
food
her
daily
portion
from
her
father
tent
and
spread
her
matting
for
his
couch
and
stole
from
duties
and
repose
to
tend
his
steps
enamoured
yet
not
daring
for
deep
awe
to
speak
her
love
and
watched
his
nightly
sleep
sleepless
herself
to
gaze
upon
his
lips
parted
in
slumber
whence
the
regular
breath
of
innocent
dreams
arose
then
when
red
morn
made
paler
the
pale
moon
to
her
cold
home
wildered
and
wan
and
panting
she
returned
the
poet
wandering
on
through
arabie
and
persia
and
the
wild
carmanian
waste
and
the
aerial
mountains
which
pour
down
indus
and
oxus
from
their
icy
caves
in
joy
and
exultation
held
his
way
till
in
the
vale
of
cashmire
far
within
its
loneliest
dell
where
odorous
plants
entwine
beneath
the
hollow
rocks
a
natural
bower
beside
a
sparkling
rivulet
he
stretched
his
languid
limbs
a
vision
on
his
sleep
there
came
a
dream
of
hopes
that
never
yet
had
flushed
his
cheek
he
dreamed
a
veiled
maid
sate
near
him
talking
in
low
solemn
tones
her
voice
was
like
the
voice
of
his
own
soul
heard
in
the
calm
of
thought
its
music
long
like
woven
sounds
of
streams
and
breezes
held
his
inmost
sense
suspended
in
its
web
of
woof
and
shifting
hues
knowledge
and
truth
and
virtue
were
her
theme
and
lofty
hopes
of
divine
liberty
thoughts
the
most
dear
to
him
and
poesy
herself
a
poet
soon
the
solemn
mood
of
her
pure
mind
kindled
through
all
her
frame
a
permeating
fire
wild
numbers
then
she
raised
with
voice
stifled
in
tremulous
sobs
subdued
by
its
own
pathos
her
fair
hands
were
bare
alone
sweeping
from
some
strange
harp
strange
symphony
and
in
their
branching
veins
the
eloquent
blood
told
an
ineffable
tale
the
beating
of
her
heart
was
heard
to
fill
the
pauses
of
her
music
and
her
breath
tumultuously
accorded
with
those
fits
of
intermitted
song
sudden
she
rose
as
if
her
heart
impatiently
endured
its
bursting
burthen
at
the
sound
he
turned
and
saw
by
the
warm
light
of
their
own
life
her
glowing
limbs
beneath
the
sinuous
veil
of
woven
wind
her
outspread
arms
now
bare
her
dark
locks
floating
in
the
breath
of
night
her
beamy
bending
eyes
her
parted
lips
outstretched
and
pale
and
quivering
eagerly
his
strong
heart
sunk
and
sickened
with
excess
of
love
he
reared
his
shuddering
limbs
and
quelled
his
gasping
breath
and
spread
his
arms
to
meet
her
panting
bosom
she
drew
back
a
while
then
yielding
to
the
irresistible
joy
with
frantic
gesture
and
short
breathless
cry
folded
his
frame
in
her
dissolving
arms
now
blackness
veiled
his
dizzy
eyes
and
night
involved
and
swallowed
up
the
vision
sleep
like
a
dark
flood
suspended
in
its
course
rolled
back
its
impulse
on
his
vacant
brain
roused
by
the
shock
he
started
from
his
trance
the
cold
white
light
of
morning
the
blue
moon
low
in
the
west
the
clear
and
garish
hills
the
distinct
valley
and
the
vacant
woods
spread
round
him
where
he
stood
whither
have
fled
the
hues
of
heaven
that
canopied
his
bower
of
yesternight
the
sounds
that
soothed
his
sleep
the
mystery
and
the
majesty
of
earth
the
joy
the
exultation
his
wan
eyes
gaze
on
the
empty
scene
as
vacantly
as
ocean
moon
looks
on
the
moon
in
heaven
the
spirit
of
sweet
human
love
has
sent
a
vision
to
the
sleep
of
him
who
spurned
her
choicest
gifts
he
eagerly
pursues
beyond
the
realms
of
dream
that
fleeting
shade
he
overleaps
the
bounds
alas
alas
were
limbs
and
breath
and
being
intertwined
thus
treacherously
lost
lost
for
ever
lost
in
the
wide
pathless
desert
of
dim
sleep
that
beautiful
shape
does
the
dark
gate
of
death
conduct
to
thy
mysterious
paradise
o
sleep
does
the
bright
arch
of
rainbow
clouds
and
pendent
mountains
seen
in
the
calm
lake
lead
only
to
a
black
and
watery
depth
while
death
blue
vault
with
loathliest
vapours
hung
where
every
shade
which
the
foul
grave
exhales
hides
its
dead
eye
from
the
detested
day
conducts
o
sleep
to
thy
delightful
realms
this
doubt
with
sudden
tide
flowed
on
his
heart
the
insatiate
hope
which
it
awakened
stung
his
brain
even
like
despair
while
daylight
held
the
sky
the
poet
kept
mute
conference
with
his
still
soul
at
night
the
passion
came
like
the
fierce
fiend
of
a
distempered
dream
and
shook
him
from
his
rest
and
led
him
forth
into
the
as
an
eagle
grasped
in
folds
of
the
green
serpent
feels
her
breast
burn
with
the
poison
and
precipitates
through
night
and
day
tempest
and
calm
and
cloud
frantic
with
dizzying
anguish
her
blind
flight
the
wide
aery
wilderness
thus
driven
by
the
bright
shadow
of
that
lovely
dream
beneath
the
cold
glare
of
the
desolate
night
through
tangled
swamps
and
deep
precipitous
dells
startling
with
careless
step
the
moonlight
snake
he
fled
red
morning
dawned
upon
his
flight
shedding
the
mockery
of
its
vital
hues
upon
his
cheek
of
death
he
wandered
on
till
vast
aornos
seen
from
petra
steep
hung
the
low
horizon
like
a
cloud
through
balk
and
where
the
desolated
tombs
of
parthian
kings
scatter
to
every
wind
their
wasting
dust
wildly
he
wandered
on
day
after
day
a
weary
waste
of
hours
bearing
within
his
life
the
brooding
care
that
ever
fed
on
its
decaying
flame
and
now
his
limbs
were
lean
his
scattered
hair
sered
by
the
autumn
of
strange
suffering
sung
dirges
in
the
wind
his
listless
hand
hung
like
dead
bone
within
its
withered
skin
life
and
the
lustre
that
consumed
it
shone
as
in
a
furnace
burning
secretly
from
his
dark
eyes
alone
the
cottagers
who
ministered
with
human
charity
his
human
wants
beheld
with
wondering
awe
their
fleeting
visitant
the
mountaineer
encountering
on
some
dizzy
precipice
that
spectral
form
deemed
that
the
spirit
of
wind
with
lightning
eyes
and
eager
breath
and
feet
disturbing
not
the
drifted
snow
had
paused
in
its
career
the
infant
would
conceal
his
troubled
visage
in
his
mother
robe
in
terror
at
the
glare
of
those
wild
eyes
to
remember
their
strange
light
in
many
a
dream
of
but
youthful
maidens
taught
by
nature
would
interpret
half
the
woe
that
wasted
him
would
call
him
with
false
names
brother
and
friend
would
press
his
pallid
hand
at
parting
and
watch
dim
through
tears
the
path
of
his
departure
from
their
father
door
at
length
upon
the
lone
chorasmian
shore
he
paused
a
wide
and
melancholy
waste
of
putrid
marshes
a
strong
impulse
urged
his
steps
to
the
a
swan
was
there
beside
a
sluggish
stream
among
the
reeds
it
rose
as
he
approached
and
with
strong
wings
scaling
the
upward
sky
bent
its
bright
course
high
over
the
immeasurable
main
his
eyes
pursued
its
flight
hast
a
home
beautiful
bird
thou
voyagest
to
thine
home
where
thy
sweet
mate
will
twine
her
downy
neck
with
thine
and
welcome
thy
return
with
eyes
bright
in
the
lustre
of
their
own
fond
joy
and
what
am
i
that
i
should
linger
here
with
voice
far
sweeter
than
thy
dying
notes
spirit
more
vast
than
thine
frame
more
attuned
to
beauty
wasting
these
surpassing
powers
in
the
deaf
air
to
the
blind
earth
and
heaven
that
echoes
not
my
thoughts
a
gloomy
smile
of
desperate
hope
wrinkled
his
quivering
lips
for
sleep
he
knew
kept
most
relentlessly
its
precious
charge
and
silent
death
exposed
faithless
perhaps
as
sleep
a
shadowy
lure
with
doubtful
smile
mocking
its
own
strange
charms
startled
by
his
own
thoughts
he
looked
around
there
was
no
fair
fiend
near
him
not
a
sight
or
sound
of
awe
but
in
his
own
deep
mind
a
little
shallop
floating
near
the
shore
caught
the
impatient
wandering
of
his
gaze
it
had
been
long
abandoned
for
its
sides
gaped
wide
with
many
a
rift
and
its
frail
joints
swayed
with
the
undulations
of
the
tide
a
restless
impulse
urged
him
to
embark
and
meet
lone
death
on
the
drear
ocean
waste
for
well
he
knew
that
mighty
shadow
loves
the
slimy
caverns
of
the
populous
deep
the
day
was
fair
and
sunny
sea
and
sky
drank
its
inspiring
radiance
and
the
wind
swept
strongly
from
the
shore
blackening
the
waves
following
his
eager
soul
the
wanderer
leaped
in
the
boat
he
spread
his
cloak
aloft
on
the
bare
mast
and
took
his
lonely
seat
and
felt
the
boat
speed
the
tranquil
sea
like
a
torn
cloud
before
the
hurricane
as
one
that
in
a
silver
vision
floats
obedient
to
the
sweep
of
odorous
winds
upon
resplendent
clouds
so
rapidly
along
the
dark
and
ruffled
waters
fled
the
straining
a
whirlwind
swept
it
on
with
fierce
gusts
and
precipitating
force
through
the
white
ridges
of
the
chafed
sea
the
waves
arose
higher
and
higher
still
their
fierce
necks
writhed
beneath
the
tempest
scourge
like
serpents
struggling
in
a
vulture
grasp
calm
and
rejoicing
in
the
fearful
war
of
wave
ruining
on
wave
and
blast
on
blast
descending
and
black
flood
on
whirlpool
driven
with
dark
obliterating
course
he
sate
as
if
their
genii
were
the
ministers
appointed
to
conduct
him
to
the
light
of
those
beloved
eyes
the
poet
sate
holding
the
steady
helm
evening
came
on
the
beams
of
sunset
hung
their
rainbow
hues
high
the
shifting
domes
of
sheeted
spray
that
canopied
his
path
the
waste
deep
twilight
ascending
slowly
from
the
east
entwined
in
duskier
wreaths
her
braided
locks
the
fair
front
and
radiant
eyes
of
day
night
followed
clad
with
stars
on
every
side
more
horribly
the
multitudinous
streams
of
ocean
mountainous
waste
to
mutual
war
rushed
in
dark
tumult
thundering
as
to
mock
the
calm
and
spangled
sky
the
little
boat
still
fled
before
the
storm
still
fled
like
foam
down
the
steep
cataract
of
a
wintry
river
now
pausing
on
the
edge
of
the
riven
wave
now
leaving
far
behind
the
bursting
mass
that
fell
convulsing
ocean
safely
fled
as
if
that
frail
and
wasted
human
form
had
been
an
elemental
god
at
midnight
the
moon
arose
and
lo
the
ethereal
cliffs
of
caucasus
whose
icy
summits
shone
among
the
stars
like
sunlight
and
around
whose
caverned
base
the
whirlpools
and
the
waves
bursting
and
eddying
irresistibly
rage
and
resound
who
shall
save
the
boat
fled
on
the
boiling
torrent
drove
the
crags
closed
round
with
black
and
jagged
arms
the
shattered
mountain
overhung
the
sea
and
faster
still
beyond
all
human
speed
suspended
on
the
sweep
of
the
smooth
wave
the
little
boat
was
driven
a
cavern
there
yawned
and
amid
its
slant
and
winding
depths
ingulfed
the
rushing
sea
the
boat
fled
on
with
unrelaxing
and
love
the
poet
cried
aloud
have
beheld
the
path
of
thy
departure
sleep
and
death
shall
not
divide
us
long
the
boat
pursued
the
windings
of
the
cavern
daylight
shone
at
length
upon
that
gloomy
river
flow
now
where
the
fiercest
war
among
the
waves
is
calm
on
the
unfathomable
stream
the
boat
moved
slowly
where
the
mountain
riven
exposed
those
black
depths
to
the
azure
sky
ere
yet
the
flood
enormous
volume
fell
even
to
the
base
of
caucasus
with
sound
that
shook
the
everlasting
rocks
the
mass
filled
with
one
whirlpool
all
that
ample
chasm
stair
above
stair
the
eddying
waters
rose
circling
immeasurably
fast
and
laved
with
alternating
dash
the
gnarled
roots
of
mighty
trees
that
stretched
their
giant
arms
in
darkness
over
it
i
the
midst
was
left
reflecting
yet
distorting
every
cloud
a
pool
of
treacherous
and
tremendous
calm
seized
by
the
sway
of
the
ascending
stream
with
dizzy
swiftness
round
and
round
and
round
ridge
after
ridge
the
straining
boat
arose
till
on
the
verge
of
the
extremest
curve
where
through
an
opening
of
the
rocky
bank
the
waters
overflow
and
a
smooth
spot
of
glassy
quiet
mid
those
battling
tides
is
left
the
boat
paused
shall
it
sink
down
the
abyss
shall
the
reverting
stress
of
that
resistless
gulf
embosom
it
now
shall
it
fall
a
wandering
stream
of
wind
breathed
from
the
west
has
caught
the
expanded
sail
and
lo
with
gentle
motion
between
banks
of
mossy
slope
and
on
a
placid
stream
beneath
a
woven
grove
it
sails
and
hark
the
ghastly
torrent
mingles
its
far
roar
with
the
breeze
murmuring
in
the
musical
woods
where
the
embowering
trees
recede
and
leave
a
little
space
of
green
expanse
the
cove
is
closed
by
meeting
banks
whose
yellow
flowers
for
ever
gaze
on
their
own
drooping
eyes
reflected
in
the
crystal
calm
the
wave
of
the
boat
motion
marred
their
pensive
task
which
naught
but
vagrant
bird
or
wanton
wind
or
falling
or
their
own
decay
had
disturbed
before
the
poet
longed
to
deck
with
their
bright
hues
his
withered
hair
but
on
his
heart
its
solitude
returned
and
he
forbore
not
the
strong
impulse
hid
in
those
flushed
cheeks
bent
eyes
and
shadowy
frame
had
yet
performed
its
ministry
it
hung
upon
his
life
as
lightning
in
a
cloud
gleams
hovering
ere
it
vanish
ere
the
floods
of
night
close
over
it
the
noonday
sun
now
shone
upon
the
forest
one
vast
mass
of
mingling
shade
whose
brown
magnificence
a
narrow
vale
embosoms
there
huge
caves
scooped
in
the
dark
base
of
their
aery
rocks
mocking
its
moans
respond
and
roar
for
ever
the
meeting
boughs
and
implicated
leaves
wove
twilight
the

path
as
led
by
love
or
dream
or
god
or
mightier
death
he
sought
in
nature
dearest
haunt
some
bank
her
cradle
and
his
sepulchre
more
dark
and
dark
the
shades
accumulate
the
oak
expanding
its
immense
and
knotty
arms
embraces
the
light
beech
the
pyramids
of
the
tall
cedar
overarching

most
solemn
domes

like
clouds
suspended
in
an
emerald
sky
the
ash

floating
hang
tremulous
and
pale
like
restless
serpents
clothed
in
rainbow
and
in
fire
the
parasites
starred
with
ten
thousand
blossoms
flow
around
the
grey
trunks
and
as
gamesome
infants
eyes
with
gentle

innocent
wiles

their
beams
round

of
those
that

beneath

canopies
extend
their
swells
fragrant
with
perfumed
herbs
and
eyed
with
blooms
minute
yet
beautiful
one
darkest
glen
sends
from
its
woods
of
twined
with
jasmine
a
odour
to
invite
to
some
more
lovely
mystery
through
the
dell
silence
and
twilight
here
keep
their
noonday
watch
and
sail
among
the
shades
like
vaporous
shapes
beyond
a
well
dark
gleaming
and
of
most
translucent

images
all
the
woven
boughs
above
and
each
depending
leaf
and
every
speck
of
azure
sky
darting
between
their
chasms
nor
aught
else
in
the
liquid
mirror
laves
its
portraiture
but
some
inconstant
star
between
one
foliaged
lattice
twinkling
fair
or
painted
bird
sleeping
beneath
the
moon
or
gorgeous
insect
floating
motionless
unconscious
of
the
day
ere
yet
his
wings
have
spread
their
glories
to
the
gaze
of
noon
hither
the
poet
came
his
eyes
beheld
their
own
wan
light
through
the
reflected
lines
of
his
thin
hair
distinct
in
the
dark
depth
of
that
still
fountain
as
the
human
heart
gazing
in
dreams
over
the
gloomy
grave
sees
its
own
treacherous
likeness
there
he
heard
the
motion
of
the
leaves
the
grass
that
sprung
startled
and
glanced
and
trembled
even
to
feel
an
unaccustomed
presence
and
the
sound
of
the
sweet
brook
that
from
the
secret
springs
of
that
dark
fountain
rose
a
spirit
seemed
to
stand
beside
him
clothed
in
no
bright
robes
of
shadowy
silver
or
enshrining
light
borrowed
from
aught
the
visible
world
affords
of
grace
or
majesty
or
mystery
but
undulating
woods
and
silent
well
and
leaping
rivulet
and
evening
gloom
now
deepening
the
dark
shades
for
speech
assuming
held
commune
with
him
as
if
he
and
it
were
all
that
was
only
when
his
regard
was
raised
by
intense
pensiveness
two
eyes
two
starry
eyes
hung
in
the
gloom
of
thought
and
seemed
with
their
serene
and
azure
smiles
to
beckon
him
obedient
to
the
light
that
shone
within
his
soul
he
went
pursuing
the
windings
of
the
the
rivulet
wanton
and
wild
through
many
a
green
ravine
beneath
the
forest
flowed
sometimes
it
fell
among
the
moss
with
hollow
harmony
dark
and
profound
now
on
the
polished
stones
it
danced
like
childhood
laughing
as
it
went
then
through
the
plain
in
tranquil
wanderings
crept
reflecting
every
herb
and
drooping
bud
that
overhung
its
stream
whose
source
is
inaccessibly
profound
whither
do
thy
mysterious
waters
tend
thou
imagest
my
life
thy
darksome
stillness
thy
dazzling
waves
thy
loud
and
hollow
gulfs
thy
searchless
fountain
and
invisible
course
have
each
their
type
in
me
and
the
wide
sky
and
measureless
ocean
may
declare
as
soon
what
oozy
cavern
or
what
wandering
cloud
contains
thy
waters
as
the
universe
tell
where
these
living
thoughts
reside
when
stretched
upon
thy
flowers
my
bloodless
limbs
shall
waste
i
the
passing
wind
beside
the
grassy
shore
of
the
small
stream
he
went
he
did
impress
on
the
green
moss
his
tremulous
step
that
caught
strong
shuddering
from
his
burning
limbs
as
one
roused
by
some
joyous
madness
from
the
couch
of
fever
he
did
move
yet
not
like
him
forgetful
of
the
grave
where
when
the
flame
of
his
frail
exultation
shall
be
spent
he
must
descend
with
rapid
steps
he
went
beneath
the
shade
of
trees
beside
the
flow
of
the
wild
babbling
rivulet
and
now
the
forest
solemn
canopies
were
changed
for
the
uniform
and
lightsome
evening
sky
grey
rocks
did
peep
from
the
spare
moss
and
stemmed
the
struggling
brook
tall
spires
of
windlestrae
threw
their
thin
shadows
down
the
rugged
slope
and
nought
but
gnarled
roots
of
ancient
pines
branchless
and
blasted
clenched
with
grasping
roots
the
unwilling
soil
a
gradual
change
was
here
yet
ghastly
for
as
fast
years
flow
away
the
smooth
brow
gathers
and
the
hair
grows
thin
and
white
and
where
irradiate
dewy
eyes
had
shone
gleam
stony
orbs
so
from
his
steps
bright
flowers
departed
and
the
beautiful
shade
of
the
green
groves
with
all
their
odorous
winds
and
musical
motions
calm
he
still
pursued
the
stream
that
with
a
larger
volume
now
rolled
through
the
labyrinthine
dell
and
there
fretted
a
path
through
its
descending
curves
with
its
wintry
speed
on

above

black

whose

ten

on

the
near

in
naked
and
severe
simplicity
made
contrast
with
the
universe
a
pine
stretched
athwart
the
vacancy
its
swinging
boughs
to

inconstant

yielding
one
only
response
at

pause
in
most
familiar
cadence
with
the
howl
the
thunder

the

of
homeless
streams

its
solemn
song

the
broad
river
foaming
and

fell
into

overlooked
in

embower

and

one

alone
has
ever
broken
the
stillness
of

solitude
one
voice
alone
inspired
its

even
that
voice
which
hither
came
floating
among
the

and
led
the
loveliest
among
human
forms
to
make
their
wild

the
depository
of
all
the

that
endued

still
guiding

career
in
thy

of

death
a
rare
and
regal
prey
he
hath
prepared
prowling
around
the
world
glutted
with
which
thou
mayst
repose
and
men
go
to
their
graves
like
flowers
or
creeping
worms
nor
ever
more
offer
at
thy
dark
shrine
the
unheeded
tribute
of
a
broken
heart
when
on
the
threshold
of
the
green
recess
the
wanderer
footsteps
fell
he
knew
that
death
was
on
him
yet
a
little
ere
it
fled
did
he
resign
his
high
and
holy
soul
to
images
of
the
majestic
past
that
paused
within
his
passive
being
now
like
winds
that
bear
sweet
music
when
they
breathe
through
some
dim
latticed
chamber
he
did
place
his
pale
lean
hand
upon
the
rugged
trunk
of
the
old
pine
upon
an
ivied
stone
reclined
his
languid
head
his
limbs
did
rest
diffused
and
motionless
on
the
smooth
brink
of
that
obscurest
chasm
and
thus
he
lay
surrendering
to
their
final
impulses
the
hovering
powers
of
life
hope
and
despair
the
torturers
slept
no
mortal
pain
or
fear
marred
his
repose
the
influxes
of
sense
and
his
own
being
unalloyed
by
pain
yet
feebler
and
more
feeble
calmly
fed
the
stream
of
thought
till
he
lay
breathing
there
at
peace
and
faintly
smiling
his
last
sight
was
the
great
moon
which
the
western
line
of
the
wide
world
her
mighty
horn
suspended
with
whose
dun
beams
inwoven
darkness
seemed
to
mingle
now
upon
the
jagged
hills
it
rests
and
still
as
the
divided
frame
of
the
vast
meteor
sunk
the
poet
blood
that
ever
beat
in
mystic
sympathy
with
nature
ebb
and
flow
grew
feebler
still
and
when
two
lessening
points
of
light
alone
gleamed
through
the
darkness
the
alternate
gasp
of
his
faint
respiration
scarce
did
stir
the
stagnate
night
till
the
minutest
ray
was
quenched
the
pulse
yet
lingered
in
his
heart
it
paused
it
fluttered
but
when
heaven
remained
utterly
black
the
murky
shades
involved
an
image
silent
cold
and
motionless
as
their
own
voiceless
earth
and
vacant
air
even
as
a
vapour
fed
with
golden
beams
that
ministered
on
sunlight
ere
the
west
eclipses
it
was
now
that
wondrous
frame
no
sense
no
motion
no
divinity
a
fragile
lute
on
whose
harmonious
strings
the
breath
of
heaven
did
wander
a
bright
stream
once
fed
with
waves
a
dream
of
youth
which
night
and
time
have
quenched
for
ever
still
dark
and
dry
and
unremembered
now
oh
for
medea
wondrous
alchemy
which
it
fell
made
the
earth
gleam
with
bright
flowers
and
the
wintry
boughs
exhale
from
vernal
blooms
fresh
fragrance
o
that
god
profuse
of
poisons
would
concede
the
chalice
which
but
one
living
man
has
drained
who
now
vessel
of
deathless
wrath
a
slave
that
feels
no
proud
exemption
in
the
blighting
curse
he
bears
over
the
world
wanders
for
ever
lone
as
incarnate
death
o
that
the
dream
of
dark
magician
in
his
visioned
cave

the
cinders
of
a
crucible
for
life

note
on
alastor
by
shelley
alastor
is
written
in
a
very
different
tone
from
queen
mab
in
the
latter
shelley
poured
out
all
the
cherished
speculations
of
his
youth
all
the
irrepressible
emotions
of
sympathy
censure
and
hope
to
which
the
present
suffering
and
what
he
considers
the
proper
destiny
of
his
gave
birth
alastor
on
the
contrary
contains
an
individual
interest
only
a
very
few
years
with
their
attendant
events
had
checked
the
ardour
of
shelley
hopes
though
he
still
thought
them
and
that
to
advance
their
fulfilment
was
the
noblest
task
man
could
achieve
this
is
neither
the
time
nor
place
to
speak
of
the
misfortunes
that
chequered
his
life
it
will
be
sufficient
to
say
that
in
all
he
did
he
at
the
time
of
doing
it
believed
himself
justified
to
his
own
conscience
while
the
various
ills
of
poverty
and
loss
of
friends
brought
home
to
him
the
sad
realities
of
life
physical
suffering
had
also
considerable
influence
in
causing
him
to
turn
his
eyes
inward
inclining
him
rather
to
brood
over
the
thoughts
and
emotions
of
his
own
soul
than
to
glance
abroad
and
to
make
as
in
queen
mab
the
whole
universe
the
object
and
subject
of
his
song
in
the
spring
of
an
eminent
physician
pronounced
that
he
was
dying
rapidly
of
a
consumption
abscesses
were
formed
on
his
lungs
and
he
suffered
acute
spasms
suddenly
a
complete
change
took
place
and
though
through
life
he
was
a
martyr
to
pain
and
debility
every
symptom
of
pulmonary
disease
vanished
his
nerves
which
nature
had
formed
sensitive
to
an
unexampled
degree
were
rendered
still
more
susceptible
by
the
state
of
his
health
as
soon
as
the
peace
of
had
opened
the
continent
he
went
abroad
he
visited
some
of
the
more
magnificent
scenes
of
switzerland
and
returned
to
england
from
lucerne
by
the
reuss
and
the
rhine
this
enchanted
him
in
his
favourite
poem
of
thalaba
his
imagination
had
been
excited
by
a
description
of
such
a
voyage
in
the
summer
of
after
a
tour
along
the
southern
coast
of
devonshire
and
a
visit
to
clifton
he
rented
a
house
on
bishopgate
heath
on
the
borders
of
windsor
forest
where
he
enjoyed
several
months
of
comparative
health
and
tranquil
happiness
the
later
summer
months
were
warm
and
dry
accompanied
by
a
few
friends
he
visited
the
source
of
the
thames
making
a
voyage
in
a
wherry
from
windsor
to
crichlade
his
beautiful
stanzas
in
the
churchyard
of
lechlade
were
written
on
that
occasion
alastor
was
composed
on
his
return
he
spent
his
days
under
the
of
windsor
great
park
and
the
magnificent
woodland
was
a
fitting
study
to
inspire
the
various
descriptions
of
forest
scenery
we
find
in
the
poem
none
of
shelley
poems
is
more
characteristic
than
this
the
solemn
spirit
that
reigns
throughout
the
worship
of
the
majesty
of
nature
the
broodings
of
a
poet
heart
in
solitude
the
mingling
of
the
exulting
joy
which
the
various
aspects
of
the
visible
universe
inspires
with
the
sad
and
struggling
pangs
which
human
passion
imparts
give
a
touching
interest
to
the
whole
the
death
which
he
had
often
contemplated
during
the
last
months
as
certain
and
near
he
here
represented
in
such
colours
as
had
in
his
lonely
musings
soothed
his
soul
to
peace
the
versification
sustains
the
solemn
spirit
which
breathes
throughout
it
is
peculiarly
melodious
the
poem
ought
rather
to
be
considered
didactic
than
narrative
it
was
the
outpouring
of
his
own
emotions
embodied
in
the
purest
form
he
could
conceive
painted
in
the
ideal
hues
which
his
brilliant
imagination
inspired

author
preface
the
poem
which
i
now
present
to
the
world
is
an
attempt
from
which
i
scarcely
dare
to
expect
success
and
in
which
a
writer
of
established
fame
might
fail
without
disgrace
it
is
an
experiment
on
the
temper
of
the
public
mind
as
to
how
far
a
thirst
for
a
happier
condition
of
moral
and
political
society
survives
among
the
enlightened
and
refined
the
tempests
which
have
shaken
the
age
in
which
we
live
i
have
sought
to
enlist
the
harmony
of
metrical
language
the
ethereal
combinations
of
the
fancy
the
rapid
and
subtle
transitions
of
human
passion
all
those
elements
which
essentially
compose
a
poem
in
the
cause
of
a
liberal
and
comprehensive
morality
and
in
the
view
of
kindling
within
the
bosoms
of
my
readers
a
virtuous
enthusiasm
for
those
doctrines
of
liberty
and
justice
that
faith
and
hope
in
something
good
which
neither
violence
nor
misrepresentation
nor
prejudice
can
ever
totally
extinguish
among
mankind
for
this
purpose
i
have
chosen
a
story
of
human
passion
in
its
most
universal
character
diversified
with
moving
and
romantic
adventures
and
appealing
in
contempt
of
all
artificial
opinions
or
institutions
to
the
common
sympathies
of
every
human
breast
i
have
made
no
attempt
to
recommend
the
motives
which
i
would
substitute
for
those
at
present
governing
mankind
by
methodical
and
systematic
argument
i
would
only
awaken
the
feelings
so
that
the
reader
should
see
the
beauty
of
true
virtue
and
be
incited
to
those
inquiries
which
have
led
to
my
moral
and
political
creed
and
that
of
some
of
the
sublimest
intellects
in
the
world
the
poem
therefore
with
the
exception
of
the
first
canto
which
is
purely
introductory
is
narrative
not
didactic
it
is
a
succession
of
pictures
illustrating
the
growth
and
progress
of
individual
mind
aspiring
after
excellence
and
devoted
to
the
love
of
mankind
its
influence
in
refining
and
making
pure
the
most
daring
and
uncommon
impulses
of
the
imagination
the
understanding
and
the
senses
its
impatience
at
the
oppressions
which
are
done
under
the
sun
its
tendency
to
awaken
public
hope
and
to
enlighten
and
improve
mankind
the
rapid
effects
of
the
application
of
that
tendency
the
awakening
of
an
immense
nation
from
their
slavery
and
degradation
to
a
true
sense
of
moral
dignity
and
freedom
the
bloodless
dethronement
of
their
oppressors
and
the
unveiling
of
the
religious
frauds
by
which
they
had
been
deluded
into
submission
the
tranquillity
of
successful
patriotism
and
the
universal
toleration
and
benevolence
of
true
philanthropy
the
treachery
and
barbarity
of
hired
soldiers
vice
not
the
object
of
punishment
and
hatred
but
kindness
and

transient
nature
of
ignorance
and
error
and
the
eternity
of
genius
and
virtue
such
is
the
series
of
delineations
of
which
the
poem
consists
and
if
the
lofty
passions
with
which
it
has
been
my
scope
to
distinguish
this
story
shall
not
excite
in
the
reader
a
generous
impulse
an
ardent
thirst
for
excellence
an
interest
profound
and
strong
such
as
belongs
to
no
meaner
desires
let
not
the
failure
be
imputed
to
a
natural
unfitness
for
human
sympathy
in
these
sublime
and
animating
themes
it
is
the
business
of
the
poet
to
communicate
to
others
the
pleasure
and
the
enthusiasm
arising
out
of
those
images
and
feelings
in
the
vivid
presence
of
which
within
his
own
mind
consists
at
once
his
inspiration
and
his
reward
the
panic
which
like
an
epidemic
transport
seized
upon
all
classes
of
men
during
the
excesses
consequent
upon
the
french
revolution
is
gradually
giving
place
to
sanity
it
has
ceased
to
be
believed
that
whole
generations
of
mankind
ought
to
consign
themselves
to
a
hopeless
inheritance
of
ignorance
and
misery
because
a
nation
of
men
who
had
been
dupes
and
slaves
for
centuries
were
incapable
of
conducting
themselves
with
the
wisdom
and
tranquillity
of
freemen
so
soon
as
some
of
their
fetters
were
partially
loosened
that
their
conduct
could
not
have
been
marked
by
any
other
characters
than
ferocity
and
thoughtlessness
is
the
historical
fact
from
which
liberty
derives
all
its
recommendations
and
falsehood
the
worst
features
of
its
deformity
there
is
a
reflux
in
the
tide
of
human
things
which
bears
the
shipwrecked
hopes
of
men
into
a
secure
haven
after
the
storms
are
past
methinks
those
who
now
live
have
survived
an
age
of
despair
the
french
revolution
may
be
considered
as
one
of
those
manifestations
of
a
general
state
of
feeling
among
civilised
mankind
produced
by
a
defect
of
correspondence
between
the
knowledge
existing
in
society
and
the
improvement
or
gradual
abolition
of
political
institutions
the
year
may
be
assumed
as
the
epoch
of
one
of
the
most
important
crises
produced
by
this
feeling
the
sympathies
connected
with
that
event
extended
to
every
bosom
the
most
generous
and
amiable
natures
were
those
which
participated
the
most
extensively
in
these
sympathies
but
such
a
degree
of
unmingled
good
was
expected
as
it
was
impossible
to
realise
if
the
revolution
had
been
in
every
respect
prosperous
then
misrule
and
superstition
would
lose
half
their
claims
to
our
abhorrence
as
fetters
which
the
captive
can
unlock
with
the
slightest
motion
of
his
fingers
and
which
do
not
eat
with
poisonous
rust
into
the
soul
the
revulsion
occasioned
by
the
atrocities
of
the
demagogues
and
the
of
successive
tyrannies
in
france
was
terrible
and
felt
in
the
remotest
corner
of
the
civilised
world
could
they
listen
to
the
plea
of
reason
who
had
groaned
under
the
calamities
of
a
social
state
according
to
the
provisions
of
which
one
man
riots
in
luxury
whilst
another
famishes
for
want
of
bread
can
he
who
the
day
before
was
a
trampled
slave
suddenly
become
forbearing
and
independent
this
is
the
consequence
of
the
habits
of
a
state
of
society
to
be
produced
by
resolute
perseverance
and
indefatigable
hope
and
and
courage
and
the
systematic
efforts
of
generations
of
men
of
intellect
and
virtue
such
is
the
lesson
which
experience
teaches
now
but
on
the
first
reverses
of
hope
in
the
progress
of
french
liberty
the
sanguine
eagerness
for
good
overleaped
the
solution
of
these
questions
and
for
a
time
extinguished
itself
in
the
unexpectedness
of
their
result
thus
many
of
the
most
ardent
and
of
the
worshippers
of
public
good
have
been
morally
ruined
by
what
a
partial
glimpse
of
the
events
they
deplored
appeared
to
show
as
the
melancholy
desolation
of
all
their
cherished
hopes
hence
gloom
and
misanthropy
have
become
the
characteristics
of
the
age
in
which
we
live
the
solace
of
a
disappointment
that
unconsciously
finds
relief
only
in
the
wilful
exaggeration
of
its
own
despair
this
influence
has
tainted
the
literature
of
the
age
with
the
hopelessness
of
the
minds
from
which
it
flows
metaphysics
i
ought
to
except
sir
drummond
academical
questions
a
volume
of
very
acute
and
powerful
metaphysical
criticism
and
inquiries
into
moral
and
political
science
have
become
little
else
than
vain
attempts
to
revive
exploded
superstitions
or
sophisms
like
those
of
malthus
it
is
remarkable
as
a
symptom
of
the
revival
of
public
hope
that
malthus
has
assigned
in
the
later
editions
of
his
work
an
indefinite
dominion
to
moral
restraint
over
the
principle
of
population
this
concession
answers
all
the
inferences
from
his
doctrine
unfavourable
to
human
improvement
and
reduces
the
essay
on
population
to
a
commentary
illustrative
of
the
unanswerableness
of
political
justice
calculated
to
lull
the
oppressors
of
mankind
into
a
security
of
everlasting
triumph
our
works
of
fiction
and
poetry
have
been
overshadowed
by
the
same
infectious
gloom
but
mankind
appear
to
me
to
be
emerging
from
their
trance
i
am
aware
methinks
of
a
slow
gradual
silent
change
in
that
belief
i
have
composed
the
following
poem
i
do
not
presume
to
enter
into
competition
with
our
greatest
contemporary
poets
yet
i
am
unwilling
to
tread
in
the
footsteps
of
any
who
have
preceded
me
i
have
sought
to
avoid
the
imitation
of
any
style
of
language
or
versification
peculiar
to
the
original
minds
of
which
it
is
the
character
designing
that
even
if
what
i
have
produced
be
worthless
it
should
still
be
properly
my
own
nor
have
i
permitted
any
system
relating
to
mere
words
to
divert
the
attention
of
the
reader
from
whatever
interest
i
may
have
succeeded
in
creating
to
my
own
ingenuity
in
contriving
to
disgust
them
according
to
the
rules
of
criticism
i
have
simply
clothed
my
thoughts
in
what
appeared
to
me
the
most
obvious
and
appropriate
language
a
person
familiar
with
nature
and
with
the
most
celebrated
productions
of
the
human
mind
can
scarcely
err
in
following
the
instinct
with
respect
to
selection
of
language
produced
by
that
familiarity
there
is
an
education
peculiarly
fitted
for
a
poet
without
which
genius
and
sensibility
can
hardly
fill
the
circle
of
their
capacities
no
education
indeed
can
entitle
to
this
appellation
a
dull
and
unobservant
mind
or
one
though
neither
dull
nor
unobservant
in
which
the
channels
of
communication
between
thought
and
expression
have
been
obstructed
or
closed
how
far
it
is
my
fortune
to
belong
to
either
of
the
latter
classes
i
can
not
know
i
aspire
to
be
something
better
the
circumstances
of
my
accidental
education
have
been
favourable
to
this
ambition
i
have
been
familiar
from
boyhood
with
mountains
and
lakes
and
the
sea
and
the
solitude
of
forests
danger
which
sports
upon
the
brink
of
precipices
has
been
my
playmate
i
have
trodden
the
glaciers
of
the
alps
and
lived
under
the
eye
of
mont
blanc
i
have
been
a
wanderer
among
distant
fields
i
have
sailed
down
mighty
rivers
and
seen
the
sun
rise
and
set
and
the
stars
come
forth
whilst
i
have
sailed
night
and
day
down
a
rapid
stream
among
mountains
i
have
seen
populous
cities
and
have
watched
the
passions
which
rise
and
spread
and
sink
and
change
amongst
assembled
multitudes
of
men
i
have
seen
the
theatre
of
the
more
visible
ravages
of
tyranny
and
war
cities
and
villages
reduced
to
scattered
groups
of
black
and
roofless
houses
and
the
naked
inhabitants
sitting
famished
upon
their
desolated
thresholds
i
have
conversed
with
living
men
of
genius
the
poetry
of
ancient
greece
and
rome
and
modern
italy
and
our
own
country
has
been
to
me
like
external
nature
a
passion
and
an
enjoyment
such
are
the
sources
from
which
the
materials
for
the
imagery
of
my
poem
have
been
drawn
i
have
considered
poetry
in
its
most
comprehensive
sense
and
have
read
the
poets
and
the
historians
and
the
metaphysicians
in
this
sense
there
may
be
such
a
thing
as
perfectibility
in
works
of
fiction
notwithstanding
the
concession
often
made
by
the
advocates
of
human
improvement
that
perfectibility
is
a
term
applicable
only
to
science
whose
writings
have
been
accessible
to
me
and
have
looked
upon
the
beautiful
and
majestic
scenery
of
the
earth
as
common
sources
of
those
elements
which
it
is
the
province
of
the
poet
to
embody
and
combine
yet
the
experience
and
the
feelings
to
which
i
refer
do
not
in
themselves
constitute
men
poets
but
only
prepares
them
to
be
the
auditors
of
those
who
are
how
far
i
shall
be
found
to
possess
that
more
essential
attribute
of
poetry
the
power
of
awakening
in
others
sensations
like
those
which
animate
my
own
bosom
is
that
which
to
speak
sincerely
i
know
not
and
which
with
an
acquiescent
and
contented
spirit
i
expect
to
be
taught
by
the
effect
which
i
shall
produce
upon
those
whom
i
now
address
i
have
avoided
as
i
have
said
before
the
imitation
of
any
contemporary
style
but
there
must
be
a
resemblance
which
does
not
depend
upon
their
own
will
between
all
the
writers
of
any
particular
age
they
can
not
escape
from
subjection
to
a
common
influence
which
arises
out
of
an
infinite
combination
of
circumstances
belonging
to
the
times
in
which
they
live
though
each
is
in
a
degree
the
author
of
the
very
influence
by
which
his
being
is
thus
pervaded
thus
the
tragic
poets
of
the
age
of
pericles
the
italian
revivers
of
ancient
learning
those
mighty
intellects
of
our
own
country
that
succeeded
the
reformation
the
translators
of
the
bible
shakespeare
spenser
the
dramatists
of
the
reign
of
elizabeth
and
lord
bacon
milton
stands
alone
in
the
age
which
he
illumined
the
colder
spirits
of
the
interval
that
succeeded
all
resemble
each
other
and
differ
from
every
other
in
their
several
classes
in
this
view
of
things
ford
can
no
more
be
called
the
imitator
of
shakespeare
than
shakespeare
the
imitator
of
ford
there
were
perhaps
few
other
points
of
resemblance
between
these
two
men
than
that
which
the
universal
and
inevitable
influence
of
their
age
produced
and
this
is
an
influence
which
neither
the
meanest
scribbler
nor
the
sublimest
genius
of
any
era
can
escape
and
which
i
have
not
attempted
to
escape
i
have
adopted
the
stanza
of
spenser
a
measure
inexpressibly
beautiful
not
because
i
consider
it
a
finer
model
of
poetical
harmony
than
the
blank
verse
of
shakespeare
and
milton
but
because
in
the
latter
there
is
no
shelter
for
mediocrity
you
must
either
succeed
or
fail
this
perhaps
an
aspiring
spirit
should
desire
but
i
was
enticed
also
by
the
brilliancy
and
magnificence
of
sound
which
a
mind
that
has
been
nourished
upon
musical
thoughts
can
produce
by
a
just
and
harmonious
arrangement
of
the
pauses
of
this
measure
yet
there
will
be
found
some
instances
where
i
have
completely
failed
in
this
attempt
and
one
which
i
here
request
the
reader
to
consider
as
an
erratum
where
there
is
left
most
inadvertently
an
alexandrine
in
the
middle
of
a
stanza
but
in
this
as
in
every
other
respect
i
have
written
fearlessly
it
is
the
misfortune
of
this
age
that
its
writers
too
thoughtless
of
immortality
are
exquisitely
sensible
to
temporary
praise
or
blame
they
write
with
the
fear
of
reviews
before
their
eyes
this
system
of
criticism
sprang
up
in
that
torpid
interval
when
poetry
was
not
poetry
and
the
art
which
professes
to
regulate
and
limit
its
powers
can
not
subsist
together
longinus
could
not
have
been
the
contemporary
of
homer
nor
boileau
of
horace
yet
this
species
of
criticism
never
presumed
to
assert
an
understanding
of
its
own
it
has
always
unlike
true
science
followed
not
preceded
the
opinion
of
mankind
and
would
even
now
bribe
with
worthless
adulation
some
of
our
greatest
poets
to
impose
gratuitous
fetters
on
their
own
imaginations
and
become
unconscious
accomplices
in
the
daily
murder
of
all
genius
either
not
so
aspiring
or
not
so
fortunate
as
their
own
i
have
sought
therefore
to
write
as
i
believe
that
homer
shakespeare
and
milton
wrote
with
an
utter
disregard
of
anonymous
censure
i
am
certain
that
calumny
and
misrepresentation
though
it
may
move
me
to
compassion
can
not
disturb
my
peace
i
shall
understand
the
expressive
silence
of
those
sagacious
enemies
who
dare
not
trust
themselves
to
speak
i
shall
endeavour
to
extract
from
the
midst
of
insult
and
contempt
and
maledictions
those
admonitions
which
may
tend
to
correct
whatever
imperfections
such
censurers
may
discover
in
this
my
first
serious
appeal
to
the
public
if
certain
critics
were
as
as
they
are
malignant
how
great
would
be
the
benefit
to
be
derived
from
their
virulent
writings
as
it
is
i
fear
i
shall
be
malicious
enough
to
be
amused
with
their
paltry
tricks
and
lame
invectives
should
the
public
judge
that
my
composition
is
worthless
i
shall
indeed
bow
before
the
tribunal
from
which
milton
received
his
crown
of
immortality
and
shall
seek
to
gather
if
i
live
strength
from
that
defeat
which
may
nerve
me
to
some
new
enterprise
of
thought
which
may
not
be
worthless
i
can
not
conceive
that
lucretius
when
he
meditated
that
poem
whose
doctrines
are
yet
the
basis
of
our
metaphysical
knowledge
and
whose
eloquence
has
been
the
wonder
of
mankind
wrote
in
awe
of
such
censure
as
the
hired
sophists
of
the
impure
and
superstitious
noblemen
of
rome
might
affix
to
what
he
should
produce
it
was
at
the
period
when
greece
was
led
captive
and
asia
made
tributary
to
the
republic
fast
verging
itself
to
slavery
and
ruin
that
a
multitude
of
syrian
captives
bigoted
to
the
worship
of
their
obscene
ashtaroth
and
the
unworthy
successors
of
socrates
and
zeno
found
there
a
precarious
subsistence
by
administering
under
the
name
of
freedmen
to
the
vices
and
vanities
of
the
great
these
wretched
men
were
skilled
to
plead
with
a
superficial
but
plausible
set
of
sophisms
in
favour
of
that
contempt
for
virtue
which
is
the
portion
of
slaves
and
that
faith
in
portents
the
most
fatal
substitute
for
benevolence
in
the
imaginations
of
men
which
arising
from
the
enslaved
communities
of
the
east
then
first
began
to
overwhelm
the
western
nations
in
its
stream
were
these
the
kind
of
men
whose
disapprobation
the
wise
and
lucretius
should
have
regarded
with
a
salutary
awe
the
latest
and
perhaps
the
meanest
of
those
who
follow
in
his
footsteps
would
disdain
to
hold
life
on
such
conditions
the
poem
now
presented
to
the
public
occupied
little
more
than
six
months
in
the
composition
that
period
has
been
devoted
to
the
task
with
unremitting
ardour
and
enthusiasm
i
have
exercised
a
watchful
and
earnest
criticism
on
my
work
as
it
grew
under
my
hands
i
would
willingly
have
sent
it
forth
to
the
world
with
that
perfection
which
long
labour
and
revision
is
said
to
bestow
but
i
found
that
if
i
should
gain
something
in
exactness
by
this
method
i
might
lose
much
of
the
newness
and
energy
of
imagery
and
language
as
it
flowed
fresh
from
my
mind
and
although
the
mere
composition
occupied
no
more
than
six
months
the
thoughts
thus
arranged
were
slowly
gathered
in
as
many
years
i
trust
that
the
reader
will
carefully
distinguish
between
those
opinions
which
have
a
dramatic
propriety
in
reference
to
the
characters
which
they
are
designed
to
elucidate
and
such
as
are
properly
my
own
the
erroneous
and
degrading
idea
which
men
have
conceived
of
a
supreme
being
for
instance
is
spoken
against
but
not
the
supreme
being
itself
the
belief
which
some
superstitious
persons
whom
i
have
brought
upon
the
stage
entertain
of
the
deity
as
injurious
to
the
character
of
his
benevolence
is
widely
different
from
my
own
in
recommending
also
a
great
and
important
change
in
the
spirit
which
animates
the
social
institutions
of
mankind
i
have
avoided
all
flattery
to
those
violent
and
malignant
passions
of
our
nature
which
are
ever
on
the
watch
to
mingle
with
and
to
alloy
the
most
beneficial
innovations
there
is
no
quarter
given
to
revenge
or
envy
or
prejudice
love
is
celebrated
everywhere
as
the
sole
law
which
should
govern
the
moral
world
dedication
there
is
no
danger
to
a
man
that
knows
what
life
and
death
is
there
not
any
law
exceeds
his
knowledge
neither
is
it
lawful
that
he
should
stoop
to
any
other
chapman
to

so
now
my
is
ended
mary
and
i
return
to
thee
mine
own
heart
home
as
to
his
queen
some
victor
knight
of
faery
earning
bright
spoils
for
her
enchanted
dome
nor
thou
disdain
that
ere
my
fame
become
a
star
among
the
stars
of
mortal
night
if
it
indeed
may
cleave
its
natal
gloom
its
doubtful
promise
thus
i
would
unite
with
thy
beloved
name
thou
child
of
love
and
light
the
toil
which
stole
from
thee
so
many
an
hour
is
ended
and
the
fruit
is
at
thy
feet
no
longer
where
the
woods
to
frame
a
bower
with
interlaced
branches
mix
and
meet
or
where
with
sound
like
many
voices
sweet
waterfalls
leap
among
wild
islands
green
which
framed
for
my
lone
boat
a
lone
retreat
of
trees
and
weeds
shall
i
be
seen
but
beside
thee
where
still
my
heart
has
ever
been
thoughts
of
great
deeds
were
mine
dear
friend
when
first
the
clouds
which
wrap
this
world
from
youth
did
pass
i
do
remember
well
the
hour
which
burst
my
spirit
sleep
a
fresh
it
was
when
i
walked
forth
upon
the
glittering
grass
and
wept
i
knew
not
why
until
there
rose
from
the
near
schoolroom
voices
that
alas
were
but
one
echo
from
a
world
of
woes
the
harsh
and
grating
strife
of
tyrants
and
of
foes
and
then
i
clasped
my
hands
and
looked
around
but
none
was
near
to
mock
my
streaming
eyes
which
poured
their
warm
drops
on
the
sunny
ground
so
without
shame
i
spake
will
be
wise
and
just
and
free
and
mild
if
in
me
lies
such
power
for
i
grow
weary
to
behold
the
selfish
and
the
strong
still
tyrannise
without
reproach
or
check
i
then
controlled
my
tears
my
heart
grew
calm
and
i
was
meek
and
bold
and
from
that
hour
did
i
with
earnest
thought
heap
knowledge
from
forbidden
mines
of
lore
yet
nothing
that
my
tyrants
knew
or
taught
i
cared
to
learn
but
from
that
secret
store
wrought
linked
armour
for
my
soul
before
it
might
walk
forth
to
war
among
mankind
thus
power
and
hope
were
strengthened
more
and
more
within
me
till
there
came
upon
my
mind
a
sense
of
loneliness
a
thirst
with
which
i
pined
alas
that
love
should
be
a
blight
and
snare
to
those
who
seek
all
sympathies
in
one
such
once
i
sought
in
vain
then
black
despair
the
shadow
of
a
starless
night
was
thrown
over
the
world
in
which
i
moved
alone
yet
never
found
i
one
not
false
to
me
hard
hearts
and
cold
like
weights
of
icy
stone
which
crushed
and
withered
mine
that
could
not
be
aught
but
a
lifeless
clod
until
revived
by
thee
thou
friend
whose
presence
on
my
wintry
heart
fell
like
bright
spring
upon
some
herbless
plain
how
beautiful
and
calm
and
free
thou
wert
in
thy
young
wisdom
when
the
mortal
chain
of
custom
thou
didst
burst
and
rend
in
twain
and
walked
as
free
as
light
the
clouds
among
which
many
an
envious
slave
then
breathed
in
vain
from
his
dim
dungeon
and
my
spirit
sprung
to
meet
thee
from
the
woes
which
had
begirt
it
long
no
more
alone
through
the
world
wilderness
although
i
trod
the
paths
of
high
intent
i
journeyed
now
no
more
companionless
where
solitude
is
like
despair
i
there
is
the
wisdom
of
a
stern
content
when
poverty
can
blight
the
just
and
good
when
infamy
dares
mock
the
innocent
and
cherished
friends
turn
with
the
multitude
to
trample
this
was
ours
and
we
unshaken
stood
now
has
descended
a
serener
hour
and
with
inconstant
fortune
friends
return
though
suffering
leaves
the
knowledge
and
the
power
which
says
let
scorn
be
not
repaid
with
scorn
and
from
thy
side
two
gentle
babes
are
born
to
fill
our
home
with
smiles
and
thus
are
we
most
fortunate
beneath
life
beaming
morn
and
these
delights
and
thou
have
been
to
me
the
parents
of
the
song
i
consecrate
to
thee
is
it
that
now
my
inexperienced
fingers
but
strike
the
prelude
of
a
loftier
strain
or
must
the
lyre
on
which
my
spirit
lingers
soon
pause
in
silence
to
sound
again
though
it
might
shake
the
anarch
custom
reign
and
charm
the
minds
of
men
to
truth
own
sway
holier
than
was
amphion
i
would
fain
reply
in
hope
but
i
am
worn
away
and
death
and
love
are
yet
contending
for
their
prey
and
what
art
thou
i
know
but
dare
not
speak
time
may
interpret
to
his
silent
years
yet
in
the
paleness
of
thy
thoughtful
cheek
and
in
the
light
thine
ample
forehead
wears
and
in
thy
sweetest
smiles
and
in
thy
tears
and
in
thy
gentle
speech
a
prophecy
is
whispered
to
subdue
my
fondest
fears
and
through
thine
eyes
even
in
thy
soul
i
see
a
lamp
of
vestal
fire
burning
internally
they
say
that
thou
wert
lovely
from
thy
birth
of
glorious
parents
thou
aspiring
child
i
wonder
not
for
one
then
left
this
earth
whose
life
was
like
a
setting
planet
mild
which
clothed
thee
in
the
radiance
undefiled
of
its
departing
glory
still
her
fame
shines
on
thee
through
the
tempests
dark
and
wild
which
shake
these
latter
days
and
thou
canst
claim
the
shelter
from
thy
sire
of
an
immortal
name
one
voice
came
forth
from
many
a
mighty
spirit
which
was
the
echo
of
three
thousand
years
and
the
tumultuous
world
stood
mute
to
hear
it
as
some
lone
man
who
in
a
desert
hears
the
music
of
his
home
unwonted
fears
fell
on
the
pale
oppressors
of
our
race
and
faith
and
custom
and
cares
like
dragons
for
a
space
left
the
torn
human
heart
their
food
and
truth
deathless
voice
pauses
among
mankind
if
there
must
be
no
response
to
my
cry
if
men
must
rise
and
stamp
with
fury
blind
on
his
pure
name
who
loves
them
thou
and
i
sweet
friend
can
look
from
our
tranquillity
like
lamps
into
the
world
tempestuous
night
two
tranquil
stars
while
clouds
are
passing
by
which
wrap
them
from
the
foundering
seaman
sight
that
burn
from
year
to

with

cloaking

when
the
last
hope
of
trampled
france
had
failed
like
a
brief
dream
of
unremaining
glory
from
visions
of
despair
i
rose
and
scaled
the
peak
of
an
aerial
promontory
whose
caverned
base
with
the
vexed
surge
was
hoary
and
saw
the
golden
dawn
break
forth
and
waken
each
cloud
and
every
wave
but
transitory
the
calm
for
sudden
the
firm
earth
was
shaken
as
if
by
the
last
wreck
its
frame
were
overtaken
so
as
i
stood
one
blast
of
muttering
thunder
burst
in
far
peals
along
the
waveless
deep
when
gathering
fast
around
above
and
under
long
trains
of
tremulous
mist
began
to
creep
until
their
complicating
lines
did
steep
the
orient
sun
in
shadow
not
a
sound
was
heard
one
horrible
repose
did
keep
the
forests
and
the
floods
and
all
around
darkness
more
dread
than
night
was
poured
upon
the
ground
hark
is
the
rushing
of
a
wind
that
sweeps
earth
and
the
ocean
see
the
lightnings
yawn
deluging
heaven
with
fire
and
the
lashed
deeps
glitter
and
boil
beneath
it
rages
on
one
mighty
stream
whirlwind
and
waves
upthrown
lightning
and
hail
and
darkness
eddying
by
there
is
a
pause
the
that
were
gone
into
their
caves
to
shriek
come
forth
to
spy
what
calm
has
on
earth
what
light
is
in
the
sky
for
where
the
irresistible
storm
had
cloven
that
fearful
darkness
the
blue
sky
was
seen
fretted
with
many
a
fair
cloud
interwoven
most
delicately
and
the
ocean
green
beneath
that
opening
spot
of
blue
serene
quivered
like
burning
emerald
calm
was
spread
on
all
below
but
far
on
high
between
earth
and
the
upper
air
the
vast
clouds
fled
countless
and
swift
as
leaves
on
autumn
tempest
shed
for
ever
as
the
war
became
more
fierce
between
the
whirlwinds
and
the
rack
on
high
that
spot
grew
more
serene
blue
light
did
pierce
the
woof
of
those
white
clouds
which
seem
to
lie
far
deep
and
motionless
while
through
the
sky
the
pallid
semicircle
of
the
moon
passed
on
in
slow
and
moving
majesty
its
upper
horn
arrayed
in
mists
which
soon
but
slowly
fled
like
dew
beneath
the
beams
of
noon
i
could
not
choose
but
gaze
a
fascination
dwelt
in
that
moon
and
sky
and
clouds
which
drew
my
fancy
thither
and
in
expectation
of
what
i
knew
not
i
remained
the
hue
of
the
white
moon
amid
that
heaven
so
blue
suddenly
stained
with
shadow
did
appear
a
speck
a
cloud
a
shape
approaching
grew
like
a
great
ship
in
the
sun
sinking
sphere
beheld
afar
at
sea
and
swift
it
came
anear
even
like
a
bark
which
from
a
chasm
of
mountains
dark
vast
and
overhanging
on
a
river
which
there
collects
the
strength
of
all
its
fountains
comes
forth
whilst
with
the
speed
its
frame
doth
quiver
sails
oars
and
stream
tending
to
one
endeavour
so
from
that
chasm
of
light
a
winged
form
on
all
the
winds
of
heaven
approaching
ever
floated
dilating
as
it
came
the
storm
pursued
it
with
fierce
blasts
and
lightnings
swift
and
warm
a
course
precipitous
of
dizzy
speed
suspending
thought
and
breath
a
monstrous
sight
for
in
the
air
do
i
behold
indeed
an
eagle
and
a
serpent
wreathed
in
fight
and
now
relaxing
its
impetuous
flight
before
the
aerial
rock
on
which
i
stood
the
eagle
hovering
wheeled
to
left
and
right
and
hung
with
lingering
wings
over
the
flood
and
startled
with
its
yells
the
wide
air
solitude
a
shaft
of
light
upon
its
wings
descended
and
every
golden
feather
gleamed
therein
feather
and
scale
inextricably
blended
the
serpent
mailed
and
skin
shone
through
the
plumes
its
coils
were
twined
within
by
many
a
swoln
and
knotted
fold
and
high
and
far
the
neck
receding
lithe
and
thin
sustained
a
crested
head
which
warily
shifted
and
glanced
before
the
eagle
steadfast
eye
around
around
in
ceaseless
circles
wheeling
with
clang
of
wings
and
scream
the
eagle
sailed
incessantly
sometimes
on
high
concealing
its
lessening
orbs
sometimes
as
if
it
failed
drooped
through
the
air
and
still
it
shrieked
and
wailed
and
casting
back
its
eager
head
with
beak
and
talon
unremittingly
assailed
the
wreathed
serpent
who
did
ever
seek
upon
his
enemy
heart
a
mortal
wound
to
wreak
what
life
what
power
was
kindled
and
arose
within
the
sphere
of
that
appalling
fray
for
from
the
encounter
of
those
wondrous
foes
a
vapour
like
the
sea
suspended
spray
hung
gathered
in
the
void
air
far
away
floated
the
shattered
plumes
bright
scales
did
leap
the
eagle
talons
made
their
way
like
sparks
into
the
darkness
as
they
sweep
blood
stains
the
snowy
foam
of
the
tumultuous
deep
swift
chances
in
that
combat
many
a
check
and
many
a
change
a
dark
and
wild
turmoil
sometimes
the
snake
around
his
enemy
neck
locked
in
stiff
rings
his
adamantine
coil
until
the
eagle
faint
with
pain
and
toil
remitted
his
strong
flight
and
near
the
sea
languidly
fluttered
hopeless
so
to
foil
his
adversary
who
then
reared
on
high
his
red
and
burning
crest
radiant
with
victory
then
on
the
white
edge
of
the
bursting
surge
where
they
had
sunk
together
would
the
snake
relax
his
suffocating
grasp
and
scourge
the
wind
with
his
wild
writhings
for
to
break
that
chain
of
torment
the
vast
bird
would
shake
the
strength
of
his
unconquerable
wings
as
in
despair
and
with
his
sinewy
neck
dissolve
in
sudden
shock
those
linked
rings
then
soar
as
swift
as
smoke
from
a
volcano
springs
wile
baffled
wile
and
strength
encountered
strength
thus
long
but
unprevailing
the
event
of
that
portentous
fight
appeared
at
length
until
the
lamp
of
day
was
almost
spent
it
had
endured
when
lifeless
stark
and
rent
hung
high
that
mighty
serpent
and
at
last
fell
to
the
sea
while
the
continent
with
clang
of
wings
and
scream
the
eagle
passed
heavily
borne
away
on
the
exhausted
blast
and
with
it
fled
the
tempest
so
that
ocean
and
earth
and
sky
shone
through
the
atmosphere
only
was
strange
to
see
the
red
commotion
of
waves
like
mountains
the
sinking
sphere
of
sunset
sweep
and
their
fierce
roar
to
hear
amid
the
calm
down
the
steep
path
i
wound
to
the
the
evening
was
most
clear
and
beautiful
and
there
the
sea
i
found
calm
as
a
cradled
child
in
dreamless
slumber
bound
there
was
a
woman
beautiful
as
morning
sitting
beneath
the
rocks
upon
the
sand
of
the
waste
sea
fair
as
one
flower
adorning
an
icy
wilderness
each
delicate
hand
lay
crossed
upon
her
bosom
and
the
band
of
her
dark
hair
had
and
so
she
sate
looking
upon
the
waves
on
the
bare
strand
upon
the
a
small
boat
did
wait
fair
as
herself
like
love
by
hope
left
desolate
it
seemed
that
this
fair
shape
had
looked
upon
that
unimaginable
fight
and
now
that
her
sweet
eyes
were
weary
of
the
sun
as
brightly
it
illustrated
her
woe
for
in
the
tears
which
silently
to
flow
paused
not
its
lustre
hung
she
watching
aye
the
which
the
faint
tide
wove
below
upon
the
spangled
sands
groaned
heavily
and
after
every
groan
looked
up
over
the
sea
and
when
she
saw
the
wounded
serpent
make
his
path
between
the
waves
her
lips
grew
pale
parted
and
quivered
the
tears
ceased
to
break
from
her
immovable
eyes
no
voice
of
wail
escaped
her
but
she
rose
and
on
the
gale
loosening
her
robe
and
shadowy
hair
poured
forth
her
voice
the
caverns
of
the
vale
that
opened
to
the
ocean
caught
it
there
and
filled
with
silver
sounds
the
overflowing
air
she
spake
in
language
whose
strange
melody
might
not
belong
to
earth
i
heard
alone
what
made
its
music
more
melodious
be
the
pity
and
the
love
of
every
tone
but
to
the
snake
those
accents
sweet
were
known
his
native
tongue
and
hers
nor
did
he
beat
the
hoar
spray
idly
then
but
winding
on
through
the
green
shadows
of
the
waves
that
meet
near
to
the
shore
did
pause
beside
her
snowy
feet
then
on
the
sands
the
woman
sate
again
and
wept
and
clasped
her
hands
and
all
between
renewed
the
unintelligible
strain
of
her
melodious
voice
and
eloquent
mien
and
she
unveiled
her
bosom
and
the
green
and
glancing
shadows
of
the
sea
did
play
its
marmoreal
depth
one
moment
seen
for
ere
the
next
the
serpent
did
obey
her
voice
and
coiled
in
rest
in
her
embrace
it
lay
then
she
arose
and
smiled
on
me
with
eyes
serene
yet
sorrowing
like
that
planet
fair
while
yet
the
daylight
lingereth
in
the
skies
which
cleaves
with
arrowy
beams
the
air
and
said
grieve
is
wise
but
the
despair
was
weak
and
vain
which
led
thee
here
from
sleep
this
shalt
thou
know
and
more
if
thou
dost
dare
with
me
and
with
this
serpent
the
deep
a
voyage
divine
and
strange
companionship
to
keep
her
voice
was
like
the
wildest
saddest
tone
yet
sweet
of
some
loved
voice
heard
long
ago
i
wept
this
fair
woman
all
alone
over
the
sea
with
that
fierce
serpent
go
his
head
is
on
her
heart
and
who
can
know
how
soon
he
may
devour
his
feeble
prey
such
were
my
thoughts
when
the
tide
gan
to
flow
and
that
strange
boat
like
the
moon
shade
did
sway
amid
reflected
stars
that
in
the
waters
lay
a
boat
of
rare
device
which
had
no
sail
but
its
own
curved
prow
of
thin
moonstone
wrought
like
a
web
of
texture
fine
and
frail
to
catch
those
gentlest
winds
which
are
not
known
to
breathe
but
by
the
steady
speed
alone
with
which
it
cleaves
the
sparkling
sea
and
now
we
are
embarked
the
mountains
hang
and
frown
over
the
starry
deep
that
gleams
below
a
vast
and
dim
expanse
as
the
waves
we
go
and
as
we
sailed
a
strange
and
awful
tale
that
woman
told
like
such
mysterious
dream
as
makes
the
slumberer
cheek
with
wonder
pale
was
midnight
and
around
a
shoreless
stream
wide
ocean
rolled
when
that
majestic
theme
shrined
in
her
heart
found
utterance
and
she
bent
her
looks
on
mine
those
eyes
a
kindling
beam
of
love
divine
into
my
spirit
sent
and
ere
her
lips
could
move
made
the
air
eloquent
not
to
me
but
hear
much
shalt
thou
learn
much
must
remain
unthought
and
more
untold
in
the
dark
future

then
that
from

the

sprung
from

its
tempestuous
jar
a
comet

the
morning

mingling
their
beams
in
combat
as
he
stood
all

war
in
dreadful
sympathy
when
to
the

the

none

the

a
dire
snake

unreconciled

lingering
the
dawn
of

was
evil

life
this
made
him
strong
to
soar
aloft
with
overshadowing
wings
and
the
great
spirit
of
good
did
creep
among
the
nations
of
mankind

every

cursed

blasphemed
him

was
many
years
ago
since
first
my
thirsting
soul
aspired
to
know
the
secrets
of
this
wondrous
world
when
deep
my
heart
was
pierced
with
sympathy
for
woe
which
could
not
be
mine
own
and
thought
did
keep
in
dream
unnatural
watch
beside
an
infant
sleep
could
not
be
mine
own
since
far
from
men
i
dwelt
a
free
and
happy
orphan
child
by
the
in
a
deep
mountain
glen
and
near
the
waves
and
through
the
forests
wild
i
roamed
to
storm
and
darkness
reconciled
for
i
was
calm
while
tempest
shook
the
sky
but
when
the
breathless
heavens
in
beauty
smiled
i
wept
sweet
tears
yet
too
tumultuously
for
peace
and
clasped
my
hands
aloft
in
ecstasy
were
forebodings
of
my
fate
before
a
woman
heart
beat
in
my
virgin
breast
it
had
been
nurtured
in
divinest
lore
a
dying
poet
gave
me
books
and
blessed
with
wild
but
holy
talk
the
sweet
unrest
in
which
i
watched
him
as
he
died
away
a
youth
with
hoary
hair
a
fleeting
guest
of
our
lone
mountains
and
this
lore
did
sway
my
spirit
like
a
storm
contending
there
alway
the
dark
tale
which
history
doth
unfold
i
knew
but
not
methinks
as
others
know
for
they
weep
not
and
wisdom
had
unrolled
the
clouds
which
hide
the
gulf
of
mortal
woe
to
few
can
she
that
warning
vision
show
for
i
loved
all
things
with
intense
devotion
so
that
when
hope
deep
source
in
fullest
flow
like
earthquake
did
uplift
the
stagnant
ocean
of
human
thoughts
mine
shook
beneath
the
wide
emotion
first
the
living
blood
through
all
these
veins
kindled
a
thought
in
sense
great
france
sprang
forth
and
seized
as
if
to
break
the
ponderous
chains
which
bind
in
woe
the
nations
of
the
earth
i
saw
and
started
from
my
and
to
the
clouds
and
waves
in
tameless
gladness
shrieked
till
they
caught
immeasurable
mirth
and
laughed
in
light
and
music
soon
sweet
madness
was
poured
upon
my
heart
a
soft
and
thrilling
sadness
slumber
fell
on
me
my
dreams
were
fire
soft
and
delightful
thoughts
did
rest
and
hover
like
shadows
my
brain
and
strange
desire
the
tempest
of
a
passion
raging
over
my
tranquil
soul
its
depths
with
light
did
cover
which
passed
and
calm
and
darkness
sweeter
far
came
then
i
loved
but
not
a
human
lover
for
when
i
rose
from
sleep
the
morning
star
shone
through
the
which
round
my
casement
were
like
an
eye
which
seemed
to
smile
on
me
i
watched
till
by
the
sun
made
pale
it
sank
under
the
billows
of
the
heaving
sea
but
from
its
beams
deep
love
my
spirit
drank
and
to
my
brain
the
boundless
world
now
shrank
into
one
thought
one
image
yes
for
ever
even
like
the
dayspring
poured
on
vapours
dank
the
beams
of
that
one
star
did
shoot
and
quiver
through
my
benighted
mind
and
were
extinguished
never
day
passed
thus
at
night
methought
in
dream
a
shape
of
speechless
beauty
did
appear
it
stood
like
light
on
a
careering
stream
of
golden
clouds
which
shook
the
atmosphere
a
winged
youth
his
radiant
brow
did
wear
the
morning
star
a
wild
dissolving
bliss
over
my
frame
he
breathed
approaching
near
and
bent
his
eyes
of
kindling
tenderness
near
mine
and
on
my
lips
impressed
a
lingering
kiss
said
a
spirit
loves
thee
mortal
maiden
how
wilt
thou
prove
thy
worth
then
joy
and
sleep
together
fled
my
soul
was
deeply
laden
and
to
the
shore
i
went
to
muse
and
weep
but
as
i
moved
over
my
heart
did
creep
a
joy
less
soft
but
more
profound
and
strong
than
my
sweet
dream
and
it
forbade
to
keep
the
path
of
the
that
spirit
tongue
seemed
whispering
in
my
heart
and
bore
my
steps
along
to
that
vast
and
peopled
city
led
which
was
a
field
of
holy
warfare
then
i
walked
among
the
dying
and
the
dead
and
shared
in
fearless
deeds
with
evil
men
calm
as
an
angel
in
the
dragon
den
how
i
braved
death
for
liberty
and
truth
and
spurned
at
peace
and
power
and
fame
and
when
those
hopes
had
lost
the
glory
of
their
youth
how
sadly
i
returned
might
move
the
hearer
ruth
tears
throng
fast
the
tale
may
not
be
said
know
then
that
when
this
grief
had
been
subdued
i
was
not
left
like
others
cold
and
dead
the
spirit
whom
i
loved
in
solitude
sustained
his
child
the
wood
the
waves
the
fountains
and
the
hush
of
night
these
were
his
voice
and
well
i
understood
his
smile
divine
when
the
calm
sea
was
bright
with
silent
stars
and
heaven
was
breathless
with
delight
lonely
glens
amid
the
roar
of
rivers
when
the
dim
nights
were
moonless
have
i
known
joys
which
no
tongue
can
tell
my
pale
lip
quivers
when
thought
revisits
them
know
thou
alone
that
after
many
wondrous
years
were
flown
i
was
awakened
by
a
shriek
of
woe
and
over
me
a
mystic
robe
was
thrown
by
viewless
hands
and
a
bright
star
did
glow
before
my
steps
the
snake
then
met
his
mortal
foe
fearest
not
then
the
serpent
on
thy
heart
it
she
said
with
brief
and
passionate
cry
and
spake
no
more
that
silence
made
me
start
i
looked
and
we
were
sailing
pleasantly
swift
as
a
cloud
between
the
sea
and
sky
beneath
the
rising
moon
seen
far
away
mountains
of
ice
like
sapphire
piled
on
high
hemming
the
horizon
round
in
silence
lay
on
the
still
waters
these
we
did
approach
alway
and
swift
and
swifter
grew
the
vessel
motion
so
that
a
dizzy
trance
fell
on
my
brain
wild
music
woke
me
we
had
passed
the
ocean
which
girds
the
pole
nature
remotest
reign
and
we
glode
fast
a
pellucid
plain
of
waters
azure
with
the
noontide
day
ethereal
mountains
shone
around
a
fane
stood
in
the
midst
girt
by
green
isles
which
lay
on
the
blue
sunny
deep
resplendent
far
away
it
was
a
temple
such
as
mortal
hand
has
never
built
nor
ecstasy
nor
dream
reared
in
the
cities
of
enchanted
land
likest
heaven
ere
yet
day
purple
stream
ebbs
the
western
forest
while
the
gleam
of
the
unrisen
moon
among
the
clouds
is
gathering
when
with
many
a
golden
beam
the
thronging
constellations
rush
in
crowds
paving
with
fire
the
sky
and
the
marmoreal
floods
like
what
may
be
conceived
of
this
vast
dome
when
from
the
depths
which
thought
can
seldom
pierce
genius
beholds
it
rise
his
native
home
girt
by
the
deserts
of
the
universe
yet
nor
in
painting
light
or
mightier
verse
or
sculpture
marble
language
can
invest
that
shape
to
mortal
sense
such
glooms
immerse
that
incommunicable
sight
and
rest
upon
the
labouring
brain
and
overburdened
breast
winding
among
the
lawny
islands
fair
whose
blosmy
forests
starred
the
shadowy
deep
the
wingless
boat
paused
where
an
ivory
stair
its
fretwork
in
the
crystal
sea
did
steep
encircling
that
vast
fane
aerial
heap
we
disembarked
and
through
a
portal
wide
we
passed
whose
roof
of
moonstone
carved
did
keep
a
glimmering
the
forms
on
every
side
sculptures
like
life
and
thought
immovable
we
came
to
a
vast
hall
whose
glorious
roof
was
diamond
which
had
drunk
the
lightning
sheen
in
darkness
and
now
poured
it
through
the
woof
of
clouds
hung
there
to
screen
its
blinding
splendour
through
such
veil
was
seen
that
work
of
subtlest
power
divine
and
rare
orb
above
orb
with
starry
shapes
between
and
horned
moons
and
meteors
strange
and
fair
on
columns
poised
one
hollow
hemisphere
ten
thousand
columns
in
that
quivering
light
distinct
between
whose
shafts
wound
far
away
the
long
and
labyrinthine
aisles
more
bright
with
their
own
radiance
than
the
heaven
of
day
and
on
the
jasper
walls
around
there
lay
paintings
the
poesy
of
mightiest
thought
which
did
the
spirit
history
display
a
tale
of
passionate
change
divinely
taught
which
in
their
winged
dance
unconscious
genii
wrought
beneath
there
sate
on
many
a
sapphire
throne
the
great
who
had
departed
from
mankind
a
mighty
senate
some
whose
white
hair
shone
like
mountain
snow
mild
beautiful
and
blind
some
female
forms
whose
gestures
beamed
with
mind
and
ardent
youths
and
children
bright
and
fair
and
some
had
lyres
whose
strings
were
intertwined
with
pale
and
clinging
flames
which
ever
there
waked
faint
yet
thrilling
sounds
that
pierced
the
crystal
air
one
seat
was
vacant
in
the
midst
a
throne
reared
on
a
pyramid
like
sculptured
flame
distinct
with
circling
steps
which
rested
on
their
own
deep
fire
soon
as
the
woman
came
into
that
hall
she
shrieked
the
spirit
name
and
fell
and
vanished
slowly
from
the
sight
darkness
arose
from
her
dissolving
frame
which
gathering
filled
that
dome
of
woven
light
blotting
its
sphered
stars
with
supernatural
night
then
first
two
glittering
lights
were
seen
to
glide
in
circles
on
the
amethystine
floor
small
serpent
eyes
trailing
from
side
to
side
like
meteors
on
a
river
grassy
shore
they
round
each
other
rolled
dilating
more
and
more
then
rose
commingling
into
one
one
clear
and
mighty
planet
hanging
a
cloud
of
deepest
shadow
which
was
thrown
athwart
the
glowing
steps
and
the
crystalline
throne
the
cloud
which
rested
on
that
cone
of
flame
was
cloven
beneath
the
planet
sate
a
form
fairer
than
tongue
can
speak
or
thought
may
frame
the
radiance
of
whose
limbs
and
warm
flowed
forth
and
did
with
softest
light
inform
the
shadowy
dome
the
sculptures
and
the
state
of
those
assembled
shapes
with
clinging
charm
sinking
upon
their
hearts
and
mine
he
sate
majestic
yet
most
mild
calm
yet
compassionate
wonder
and
joy
a
passing
faintness
threw
over
my
brow
a
hand
supported
me
whose
touch
was
magic
strength
an
eye
of
blue
looked
into
mine
like
moonlight
soothingly
and
a
voice
said
must
a
listener
be
this
day
two
mighty
spirits
now
return
like
birds
of
calm
from
the
world
raging
sea
they
pour
fresh
light
from
hope
immortal
urn
a
tale
of
human
power
despair
not
list
and
learn
i
looked
and
lo
one
stood
forth
eloquently
his
eyes
were
dark
and
deep
and
the
clear
brow
which
shadowed
them
was
like
the
morning
sky
the
cloudless
heaven
of
spring
when
in
their
flow
through
the
bright
air
the
soft
winds
as
they
blow
wake
the
green
world
his
gestures
did
obey
the
oracular
mind
that
made
his
features
glow
and
where
his
curved
lips
lay
passion
divinest
stream
had
made
impetuous
way
beneath
the
darkness
of
his
outspread
hair
he
stood
thus
beautiful
but
there
was
one
who
sate
beside
him
like
his
shadow
there
and
held
his
hand
far
lovelier
she
was
known
to
be
thus
fair
by
the
few
lines
alone
which
through
her
floating
locks
and
gathered
cloak
glances
of
glory
shone
none
else
beheld
her
eyes
in
him
they
woke
memories
which
found
a
tongue
as
thus
he
silence
broke
canto
the
starlight
smile
of
children
the
sweet
looks
of
women
the
fair
breast
from
which
i
fed
the
murmur
of
the
unreposing
brooks
and
the
green
light
which
shifting
overhead
some
tangled
bower
of
vines
around
me
shed
the
shells
on
the
and
the
wild
flowers
the
through
the
rafters
cheerly
spread
and
on
the
twining
flax
in
life
young
hours
these
sights
and
sounds
did
nurse
my
spirit
folded
powers
in
argolis
beside
the
echoing
sea
such
impulses
within
my
mortal
frame
arose
and
they
were
dear
to
memory
like
tokens
of
the
dead
but
others
came
soon
in
another
shape
the
wondrous
fame
of
the
past
world
the
vital
words
and
deeds
of
minds
whom
neither
time
nor
change
can
tame
traditions
dark
and
old
whence
evil
creeds
start
forth
and
whose
dim
shade
a
stream
of
poison
feeds
i
heard
as
all
have
heard
the
various
story
of
human
life
and
wept
unwilling
tears
feeble
historians
of
its
shame
and
glory
false
disputants
on
all
its
hopes
and
fears
victims
who
worshipped
ruin
chroniclers
of
daily
scorn
and
slaves
who
loathed
their
state
yet
flattering
power
had
given
its
ministers
a
throne
of
judgement
in
the
grave
was
fate
that
among
such
as
these
my
youth
should
seek
its
mate
the
land
in
which
i
lived
by
a
fell
bane
was
withered
up
tyrants
dwelt
side
by
side
and
stabled
in
our
homes
until
the
chain
stifled
the
captive
cry
and
to
abide
that
blasting
curse
men
had
no
shame
all
vied
in
evil
slave
and
despot
fear
with
lust
strange
fellowship
through
mutual
hate
had
tied
like
two
dark
serpents
tangled
in
the
dust
which
on
the
paths
of
men
their
mingling
poison
thrust
earth
our
bright
home
its
mountains
and
its
waters
and
the
ethereal
shapes
which
are
suspended
over
its
green
expanse
and
those
fair
daughters
the
clouds
of
sun
and
ocean
who
have
blended
the
colours
of
the
air
since
first
extended
it
cradled
the
young
world
none
wandered
forth
to
see
or
feel
a
darkness
had
descended
on
every
heart
the
light
which
shows
its
worth
must
among
gentle
thoughts
and
fearless
take
its
birth
this
vital
world
this
home
of
happy
spirits
was
as
a
dungeon
to
my
blasted
kind
all
that
despair
from
murdered
hope
inherits
they
sought
and
in
their
helpless
misery
blind
a
deeper
prison
and
heavier
chains
did
find
and
stronger
tyrants
a
dark
gulf
before
the
realm
of
a
stern
ruler
yawned
behind
terror
and
time
conflicting
drove
and
bore
on
their
tempestuous
flood
the
shrieking
wretch
from
shore
out
of
that
ocean
wrecks
had
guilt
and
woe
framed
a
dark
dwelling
for
their
homeless
thought
and
starting
at
the
ghosts
which
to
and
fro
glide
its
dim
and
gloomy
strand
had
brought
the
worship
thence
which
they
each
other
taught
well
might
men
loathe
their
life
well
might
they
turn
even
to
the
ills
again
from
which
they
sought
such
refuge
after
death
well
might
they
learn
to
gaze
on
this
fair
world
with
hopeless
unconcern
for
they
all
pined
in
bondage
body
and
soul
tyrant
and
slave
victim
and
torturer
bent
before
one
power
to
which
supreme
control
over
their
will
by
their
own
weakness
lent
made
all
its
many
names
omnipotent
all
symbols
of
things
evil
all
divine
and
hymns
of
blood
or
mockery
which
rent
the
air
from
all
its
fanes
did
intertwine
imposture
impious
toils
round
each
discordant
shrine
i
heard
as
all
have
heard
life
various
story
and
in
no
careless
heart
transcribed
the
tale
but
from
the
sneers
of
men
who
had
grown
hoary
in
shame
and
scorn
from
groans
of
crowds
made
pale
by
famine
from
a
mother
desolate
wail
her
polluted
child
from
innocent
blood
poured
on
the
earth
and
brows
anxious
and
pale
with
the
heart
warfare
did
i
gather
food
to
feed
my
many
thoughts
a
tameless
multitude
i
wandered
through
the
wrecks
of
days
departed
far
by
the
desolated
shore
when
even
the
still
sea
and
jagged
islets
darted
the
light
of
moonrise
in
the
northern
heaven
among
the
clouds
near
the
horizon
driven
the
mountains
lay
beneath
one
planet
pale
around
me
broken
tombs
and
columns
riven
looked
vast
in
twilight
and
the
sorrowing
gale
waked
in
those
ruins
gray
its
everlasting
wail
i
knew
not
who
had
framed
these
wonders
then
nor
had
i
heard
the
story
of
their
deeds
but
dwellings
of
a
race
of
mightier
men
and
monuments
of
less
ungentle
creeds
tell
their
own
tale
to
him
who
wisely
heeds
the
language
which
they
speak
and
now
to
me
the
moonlight
making
pale
the
blooming
weeds
the
bright
stars
shining
in
the
breathless
sea
interpreted
those
scrolls
of
mortal
mystery
such
man
has
been
and
such
may
yet
become
ay
wiser
greater
gentler
even
than
they
who
on
the
fragments
of
yon
shattered
dome
have
stamped
the
sign
of
power
i
felt
the
sway
of
the
vast
stream
of
ages
bear
away
my
floating
thoughts
my
heart
beat
loud
and
fast
even
as
a
storm
let
loose
beneath
the
ray
of
the
still
moon
my
spirit
onward
passed
beneath
truth
steady
beams
upon
its
tumult
cast
it
shall
be
thus
no
more
too
long
too
long
sons
of
the
glorious
dead
have
ye
lain
bound
in
darkness
and
in
ruin
hope
is
strong
justice
and
truth
their
winged
child
have
found
awake
arise
until
the
mighty
sound
of
your
career
shall
scatter
in
its
gust
the
thrones
of
the
oppressor
and
the
ground
hide
the
last
altar
unregarded
dust
whose
idol
has
so
long
betrayed
your
impious
trust
it
must
be
so
i
will
arise
and
waken
the
multitude
and
like
a
sulphurous
hill
which
on
a
sudden
from
its
snows
has
shaken
the
swoon
of
ages
it
shall
burst
and
fill
the
world
with
cleansing
fire
it
must
it
will
it
may
not
be
restrained
and
who
shall
stand
amid
the
rocking
earthquake
steadfast
still
but
laon
on
high
freedom
desert
land
a
tower
whose
marble
walls
the
leagued
storms
withstand
one
summer
night
in
commune
with
the
hope
thus
deeply
fed
amid
those
ruins
gray
i
watched
beneath
the
dark
sky
starry
cope
and
ever
from
that
hour
upon
me
lay
the
burden
of
this
hope
and
night
or
day
in
vision
or
in
dream
clove
to
my
breast
among
mankind
or
when
gone
far
away
to
the
lone
shores
and
mountains
was
a
guest
which
followed
where
i
fled
and
watched
when
i
did
rest
these
hopes
found
words
through
which
my
spirit
sought
to
weave
a
bondage
of
such
sympathy
as
might
create
some
response
to
the
thought
which
ruled
me
now
and
as
the
vapours
lie
bright
in
the
outspread
morning
radiancy
so
were
these
thoughts
invested
with
the
light
of
language
and
all
bosoms
made
reply
on
which
its
lustre
streamed
it
might
through
darkness
wide
and
deep
those
tranced
spirits
smite
yes
many
an
eye
with
dizzy
tears
was
dim
and
oft
i
thought
to
clasp
my
own
heart
brother
when
i
could
feel
the
listener
senses
swim
and
hear
his
breath
its
own
swift
gaspings
smother
even
as
my
words
evoked
them
and
another
and
yet
another
i
did
fondly
deem
felt
that
we
all
were
sons
of
one
great
mother
and
the
cold
truth
such
sad
reverse
did
seem
as
to
awake
in
grief
from
some
delightful
dream
yes
oft
beside
the
ruined
labyrinth
which
skirts
the
hoary
caves
of
the
green
deep
did
laon
and
his
friend
on
one
gray
plinth
round
whose
worn
base
the
wild
waves
hiss
and
leap
resting
at
eve
a
lofty
converse
keep
and
that
this
friend
was
false
may
now
be
said
calmly
that
he
like
other
men
could
weep
tears
which
are
lies
and
could
betray
and
spread
snares
for
that
guileless
heart
which
for
his
own
had
bled
then
had
no
great
aim
recompensed
my
sorrow
i
must
have
sought
dark
respite
from
its
stress
in
dreamless
rest
in
sleep
that
sees
no
morrow
for
to
tread
life
dismaying
wilderness
without
one
smile
to
cheer
one
voice
to
bless
amid
the
snares
and
scoffs
of
human
kind
is
hard
but
i
betrayed
it
not
nor
less
with
love
that
scorned
return
sought
to
unbind
the
interwoven
clouds
which
make
its
wisdom
blind
with
deathless
minds
which
leave
where
they
have
passed
a
path
of
light
my
soul
communion
knew
till
from
that
glorious
intercourse
at
last
as
from
a
mine
of
magic
store
i
drew
words
which
were
weapons
round
my
heart
there
grew
the
adamantine
armour
of
their
power
and
from
my
fancy
wings
of
golden
hue
sprang
forth
yet
not
alone
from
wisdom
tower
a
minister
of
truth
these
plumes
young
laon
bore
an
orphan
with
my
parents
lived
whose
eyes
were
lodestars
of
delight
which
drew
me
home
when
i
might
wander
forth
nor
did
i
prize
aught
human
thing
beneath
heaven
mighty
dome
beyond
this
child
so
when
sad
hours
were
come
and
baffled
hope
like
ice
still
clung
to
me
since
kin
were
cold
and
friends
had
now
become
heartless
and
false
i
turned
from
all
to
be
cythna
the
only
source
of
tears
and
smiles
to
thee
what
wert
thou
then
a
child
most
infantine
yet
wandering
far
beyond
that
innocent
age
in
all
but
its
sweet
looks
and
mien
divine
even
then
methought
with
the
world
tyrant
rage
a
patient
warfare
thy
young
heart
did
wage
when
those
soft
eyes
of
scarcely
conscious
thought
some
tale
or
thine
own
fancies
would
engage
to
overflow
with
tears
or
converse
fraught
with
passion
their
depths
its
fleeting
light
had
wrought
she
moved
upon
this
earth
a
shape
of
brightness
a
power
that
from
its
objects
scarcely
drew
one
impulse
of
her
being
in
her
lightness
most
like
some
radiant
cloud
of
morning
dew
which
wanders
through
the
waste
air
pathless
blue
to
nourish
some
far
desert
she
did
seem
beside
me
gathering
beauty
as
she
grew
like
the
bright
shade
of
some
immortal
dream
which
walks
when
tempest
sleeps
the
wave
of
life
dark
stream
as
mine
own
shadow
was
this
child
to
me
a
second
self
far
dearer
and
more
fair
which
clothed
in
undissolving
radiancy
all
those
steep
paths
which
languor
and
despair
of
human
things
had
made
so
dark
and
bare
but
which
i
trod
alone
nor
till
bereft
of
friends
and
overcome
by
lonely
care
knew
i
what
solace
for
that
loss
was
left
though
by
a
bitter
wound
my
trusting
heart
was
cleft
once
she
was
dear
now
she
was
all
i
had
to
love
in
human
life
this
playmate
sweet
this
child
of
twelve
years
old
so
she
was
made
my
sole
associate
and
her
willing
feet
wandered
with
mine
where
earth
and
ocean
meet
beyond
the
aereal
mountains
whose
vast
cells
the
unreposing
billows
ever
beat
through
forests
wild
and
old
and
lawny
dells
where
boughs
of
incense
droop
over
the
emerald
wells
and
warm
and
light
i
felt
her
clasping
hand
when
twined
in
mine
she
followed
where
i
went
through
the
lone
paths
of
our
immortal
land
it
had
no
waste
but
some
memorial
lent
which
strung
me
to
my
toil
some
monument
vital
with
mind
then
cythna
by
my
side
until
the
bright
and
beaming
day
were
spent
would
rest
with
looks
entreating
to
abide
too
earnest
and
too
sweet
ever
to
be
denied
and
soon
i
could
not
have
refused
her
thus
for
ever
day
and
night
we
two
were
parted
but
when
brief
sleep
divided
us
and
when
the
pauses
of
the
lulling
air
of
noon
beside
the
sea
had
made
a
lair
for
her
soothed
senses
in
my
arms
she
slept
and
i
kept
watch
over
her
slumbers
there
while
as
the
shifting
visions
over
her
swept
amid
her
innocent
rest
by
turns
she
smiled
and
wept
and
in
the
murmur
of
her
dreams
was
heard
sometimes
the
name
of
laon
suddenly
she
would
arise
and
like
the
secret
bird
whom
sunset
wakens
fill
the
shore
and
sky
with
her
sweet
accents
a
wild
melody
hymns
which
my
soul
had
woven
to
freedom
strong
the
source
of
passion
whence
they
rose
to
be
triumphant
strains
which
like
a
spirit
tongue
to
the
enchanted
waves
that
child
of
glory
sung
her
white
arms
lifted
through
the
shadowy
stream
of
her
loose
hair
oh
excellently
great
seemed
to
me
then
my
purpose
the
vast
theme
of
those
impassioned
songs
when
cythna
sate
amid
the
calm
which
rapture
doth
create
after
its
tumult
her
heart
vibrating
her
spirit
the
ocean
floating
state
from
her
deep
eyes
far
wandering
on
the
wing
of
visions
that
were
mine
beyond
its
utmost
spring
for
before
cythna
loved
it
had
my
song
peopled
with
thoughts
the
boundless
universe
a
mighty
congregation
which
were
strong
they
trod
the
darkness
to
disperse
the
cloud
of
that
unutterable
curse
which
clings
upon
mankind
all
things
became
slaves
to
my
holy
and
heroic
verse
earth
sea
and
sky
the
planets
life
and
fame
and
fate
or
else
binds
the
world
wondrous
frame
and
this
beloved
child
thus
felt
the
sway
of
my
conceptions
gathering
like
a
cloud
the
very
wind
on
which
it
rolls
away
hers
too
were
all
my
thoughts
ere
yet
endowed
with
music
and
with
light
their
fountains
flowed
in
poesy
and
her
still
and
earnest
face
pallid
with
feelings
which
intensely
glowed
within
was
turned
on
mine
with
speechless
grace
watching
the
hopes
which
there
her
heart
had
learned
to
trace
in
me
communion
with
this
purest
being
kindled
intenser
zeal
and
made
me
wise
in
knowledge
which
in
hers
mine
own
mind
seeing
left
in
the
human
world
few
mysteries
how
without
fear
of
evil
or
disguise
was
cythna
what
a
spirit
strong
and
mild
which
death
or
pain
or
peril
could
despise
yet
melt
in
tenderness
what
genius
wild
yet
mighty
was
enclosed
within
one
simple
child
new
lore
was
this
old
age
with
its
gray
hair
and
wrinkled
legends
of
unworthy
things
and
icy
sneers
is
nought
it
can
not
dare
to
burst
the
chains
which
life
for
ever
flings
on
the
entangled
soul
aspiring
wings
so
is
it
cold
and
cruel
and
is
made
the
careless
slave
of
that
dark
power
which
brings
evil
like
blight
on
man
who
still
betrayed
laughs
the
grave
in
which
his
living
hopes
are
laid
nor
are
the
strong
and
the
severe
to
keep
the
empire
of
the
world
thus
cythna
taught
even
in
the
visions
of
her
eloquent
sleep
unconscious
of
the
power
through
which
she
wrought
the
woof
of
such
intelligible
thought
as
from
the
tranquil
strength
which
cradled
lay
in
her
rest
my
spirit
sought
why
the
deceiver
and
the
slave
has
sway
heralds
so
divine
of
truth
arising
day
within
that
fairest
form
the
female
mind
untainted
by
the
poison
clouds
which
rest
on
the
dark
world
a
sacred
home
did
find
but
else
from
the
wide
earth
maternal
breast
victorious
evil
which
had
dispossessed
all
native
power
had
those
fair
children
torn
and
made
them
slaves
to
soothe
his
vile
unrest
and
minister
to
lust
its
joys
forlorn
till
they
had
learned
to
breathe
the
atmosphere
of
scorn
this
misery
was
but
coldly
felt
till
she
became
my
only
friend
who
had
endued
my
purpose
with
a
wider
sympathy
thus
cythna
mourned
with
me
the
servitude
in
which
the
half
of
humankind
were
mewed
victims
of
lust
and
hate
the
slaves
of
slaves
she
mourned
that
grace
and
power
were
thrown
as
food
to
the
hyena
lust
who
among
graves
over
his
loathed
meal
laughing
in
agony
raves
and
i
still
gazing
on
that
glorious
child
even
as
these
thoughts
flushed
her
sweet
well
with
the
world
art
thou
unreconciled
never
will
peace
and
human
nature
meet
till
free
and
equal
man
and
woman
greet
domestic
peace
and
ere
this
power
can
make
in
human
hearts
its
calm
and
holy
seat
this
slavery
must
be
broken
as
i
spake
from
cythna
eyes
a
light
of
exultation
brake
she
replied
earnestly
shall
be
mine
this
task
mine
laon
thou
hast
much
to
gain
nor
wilt
thou
at
poor
cythna
pride
repine
if
she
should
lead
a
happy
female
train
to
meet
thee
over
the
rejoicing
plain
when
myriads
at
thy
call
shall
throng
around
the
golden
city
then
the
child
did
strain
my
arm
upon
her
tremulous
heart
and
wound
her
own
about
my
neck
till
some
reply
she
found
i
smiled
and
spake
dost
thou
smile
at
what
i
say
laon
i
am
not
weak
and
though
my
cheek
might
become
pale
the
while
with
thee
if
thou
desirest
will
i
seek
through
their
array
of
banded
slaves
to
wreak
ruin
upon
the
tyrants
i
had
thought
it
was
more
hard
to
turn
my
unpractised
cheek
to
scorn
and
shame
and
this
beloved
spot
and
thee
o
dearest
friend
to
leave
and
murmur
not
came
i
what
i
am
thou
laon
knowest
how
a
young
child
should
thus
undaunted
be
methinks
it
is
a
power
which
thou
bestowest
through
which
i
seek
by
most
resembling
thee
so
to
become
most
good
and
great
and
free
yet
far
beyond
this
ocean
utmost
roar
in
towers
and
huts
are
many
like
to
me
who
could
they
see
thine
eyes
or
feel
such
lore
as
i
have
learnt
from
them
like
me
would
fear
no
more
thou
that
i
shall
speak
unskilfully
and
none
will
heed
me
i
remember
now
how
once
a
slave
in
tortures
doomed
to
die
was
saved
because
in
accents
sweet
and
low
he
sung
a
song
his
judge
loved
long
ago
as
he
was
led
to
all
shall
relent
who
hear
me
tears
as
mine
have
flowed
shall
flow
hearts
beat
as
mine
now
beats
with
such
intent
as
renovates
the
world
a
will
omnipotent
i
will
tread
pride
golden
palaces
through
penury
roofless
huts
and
squalid
cells
will
i
descend
in
abjectness
woman
with
some
vile
slave
her
tyrant

there
with
the
music
of
thine
own
sweet
spells
will
disenchant
the
captives
and
will
pour
for
the
despairing
from
the
crystal
wells
of
thy
deep
spirit
reason
mighty
lore
and
power
shall
then
abound
and
hope
arise
once
more
man
be
free
if
woman
be
a
slave
chain
one
who
lives
and
breathes
this
boundless
air
to
the
corruption
of
a
closed
grave

they
whose
mates

beasts
condemned
to
bear
scorn
heavier
far
than

or

to
trample
their
oppressors
in
their

wear
the
shape

come
behind
and

tottering
dome
am
a
child
i
would
not
yet
depart
when
i
go
forth
alone
bearing
the
lamp
aloft
which
thou
hast
kindled
in
my
heart
millions
of
slaves
from
many
a
dungeon
damp
shall
leap
in
joy
as
the
benumbing
cramp
of
ages
leaves
their
limbs
no

thy
cythna

radiant
stamp

an
invulnerable
charm
upon
her
children
brow
dark
falsehood
to
disarm
yet
awhile
for
the
appointed
day
thou
wilt
depart
and
i
with
tears
shall
stand
watching
thy
dim
sail
skirt
the
ocean
gray
amid
the
dwellers
of
this
lonely
land
i
shall
remain
alone
and
thy
command
shall
then
dissolve
the
world
unquiet
trance
and
multitudinous
as
the
desert
sand
borne
on
the
storm
its
millions
shall
advance
thronging
round
thee
the
light
of
their
deliverance
like
the
forests
of
some
pathless
mountain
which
from
remotest
glens
two
warring
winds
involve
in
fire
which
not
the
loosened
fountain
of
broadest
floods
might
quench
shall
all
the
kinds
of
evil
catch
from
our
uniting
minds
the
spark
which
must
consume
them
cythna
then
will
have
cast
off
the
impotence
that
binds
her
childhood
now
and
through
the
paths
of
men
will
pass
as
the
charmed
bird
that
haunts
the
serpent
den
part
o
laon
i
must
dare
nor
tremble
to
meet
those
looks
no
more
oh
heavy
stroke
sweet
brother
of
my
soul
can
i
dissemble
the
agony
of
this
thought
as
thus
she
spoke
the
gathered
sobs
her
quivering
accents
broke
and
in
my
arms
she
hid
her
beating
breast
i
remained
still
for
tears
sudden
she
woke
as
one
awakes
from
sleep
and
wildly
pressed
my
bosom
her
whole
frame
impetuously
possessed
part
to
meet
again
but
yon
blue
waste
yon
desert
wide
and
deep
holds
no
recess
within
whose
happy
silence
thus
embraced
we
might
survive
all
ills
in
one
caress
nor
doth
the
grave
i
fear
is
passionless
nor
yon
cold
vacant
heaven
we
meet
again
within
the
minds
of
men
whose
lips
shall
bless
our
memory
and
whose
hopes
its
light
retain
when
these
dissevered
bones
are
trodden
in
the
plain
i
could
not
speak
though
she
had
ceased
for
now
the
fountains
of
her
feeling
swift
and
deep
seemed
to
suspend
the
tumult
of
their
flow
so
we
arose
and
by
the
starlight
steep
went
homeward
neither
did
we
speak
nor
weep
but
pale
were
calm
with
passion
thus
subdued
like
evening
shades
that
the
mountains
creep
we
moved
towards
our
home
where
in
this
mood
each
from
the
other
sought
refuge
in
solitude
canto
what
thoughts
had
sway
cythna
lonely
slumber
that
night
i
know
not
but
my
own
did
seem
as
if
they
might
ten
thousand
years
outnumber
of
waking
life
the
visions
of
a
dream
which
hid
in
one
dim
gulf
the
troubled
stream
of
mind
a
boundless
chaos
wild
and
vast
whose
limits
yet
were
never
memory
theme
and
i
lay
struggling
as
its
whirlwinds
passed
sometimes
for
rapture
sick
sometimes
for
pain
aghast
two
hours
whose
mighty
circle
did
embrace
more
time
than
might
make
gray
the
infant
world
rolled
thus
a
weary
and
tumultuous
space
when
the
third
came
like
mist
on
breezes
curled
from
my
dim
sleep
a
shadow
was
unfurled
methought
upon
the
threshold
of
a
cave
i
sate
with
cythna
drooping
briony
pearled
with
dew
from
the
wild
streamlet
shattered
wave
hung
where
we
sate
to
taste
the
joys
which
nature
gave
we
lived
a
day
as
we
were
wont
to
live
but
nature
had
a
robe
of
glory
on
and
the
bright
air
every
shape
did
weave
intenser
hues
so
that
the
herbless
stone
the
leafless
bough
among
the
leaves
alone
had
being
clearer
than
its
own
could
be
and
cythna
pure
and
radiant
self
was
shown
in
this
strange
vision
so
divine
to
me
that
if
i
loved
before
now
love
was
agony
morn
fled
noon
came
evening
then
night
descended
and
we
prolonged
calm
talk
beneath
the
sphere
of
the
calm
moon
when
suddenly
was
blended
with
our
repose
a
nameless
sense
of
fear
and
from
the
cave
behind
i
seemed
to
hear
sounds
gathering
upwards
accents
incomplete
and
stifled
shrieks
and
now
more
near
and
near
a
tumult
and
a
rush
of
thronging
feet
the
cavern
secret
depths
beneath
the
earth
did
beat
the
scene
was
changed
and
away
away
away
through
the
air
and
over
the
sea
we
sped
and
cythna
in
my
sheltering
bosom
lay
and
the
winds
bore
me
through
the
darkness
spread
around
the
gaping
earth
then
vomited
legions
of
foul
and
ghastly
shapes
which
hung
upon
my
flight
and
ever
as
we
fled
they
plucked
at
cythna
soon
to
me
then
clung
a
sense
of
actual
things
those
monstrous
dreams
among
and
i
lay
struggling
in
the
impotence
of
sleep
while
outward
life
had
burst
its
bound
though
still
deluded
strove
the
tortured
sense
to
its
dire
wanderings
to
adapt
the
sound
which
in
the
light
of
morn
was
poured
around
our
dwelling
breathless
pale
and
unaware
i
rose
and
all
the
cottage
crowded
found
with
armed
men
whose
glittering
swords
were
bare
and
whose
degraded
limbs
the
tyrant
garb
did
wear
and
ere
with
rapid
lips
and
gathered
brow
i
could
demand
the
cause
a
feeble
shriek
it
was
a
feeble
shriek
faint
far
and
low
arrested
me
my
mien
grew
calm
and
meek
and
grasping
a
small
knife
i
went
to
seek
that
voice
among
the
crowd
was
cythna
cry
beneath
most
calm
resolve
did
agony
wreak
its
whirlwind
rage
so
i
passed
quietly
till
i
beheld
where
bound
that
dearest
child
did
lie
i
started
to
behold
her
for
delight
and
exultation
and
a
joyance
free
solemn
serene
and
lofty
filled
the
light
of
the
calm
smile
with
which
she
looked
on
me
so
that
i
feared
some
brainless
ecstasy
wrought
from
that
bitter
woe
had
wildered
her
farewell
she
said
as
i
drew
nigh
first
my
peace
was
marred
by
this
strange
stir
now
i
am
calm
as
truth
its
chosen
minister
not
so
laon
say
farewell
in
hope
these
bloody
men
are
but
the
slaves
who
bear
their
mistress
to
her
task
it
was
my
scope
the
slavery
where
they
drag
me
now
to
share
and
among
captives
willing
chains
to
wear
awhile
the
rest
thou
knowest
return
dear
friend
let
our
first
triumph
trample
the
despair
which
would
ensnare
us
now
for
in
the
end
in
victory
or
in
death
our
hopes
and
fears
must
blend
these
words
had
fallen
on
my
unheeding
ear
whilst
i
had
watched
the
motions
of
the
crew
with
glance
not
many
were
around
her
for
their
comrades
just
withdrew
to
guard
some
other
victim
so
i
drew
my
knife
and
with
one
impulse
suddenly
all
unaware
three
of
their
number
slew
and
grasped
a
fourth
by
the
throat
and
with
loud
cry
my
countrymen
invoked
to
death
or
liberty
what
followed
then
i
know
not
for
a
stroke
on
my
raised
arm
and
naked
head
came
down
filling
my
eyes
with
when
i
awoke
i
felt
that
they
had
bound
me
in
my
swoon
and
up
a
rock
which
overhangs
the
town
by
the
steep
path
were
bearing
me
below
the
plain
was
filled
with
slaughter
overthrown
the
vineyards
and
the
harvests
and
the
glow
of
blazing
roofs
shone
far
the
white
ocean
flow
upon
that
rock
a
mighty
column
stood
whose
capital
seemed
sculptured
in
the
sky
which
to
the
wanderers
the
solitude
of
distant
seas
from
ages
long
gone
by
had
made
a
landmark
its
height
to
fly
scarcely
the
cloud
the
vulture
or
the
blast
has
power
and
when
the
shades
of
evening
lie
on
earth
and
ocean
its
carved
summits
cast
the
sunken
daylight
far
through
the
aerial
waste
they
bore
me
to
a
cavern
in
the
hill
beneath
that
column
and
unbound
me
there
and
one
did
strip
me
stark
and
one
did
fill
a
vessel
from
the
putrid
pool
one
bare
a
lighted
torch
and
four
with
friendless
care
guided
my
steps
the
along
then
up
a
steep
and
dark
and
narrow
stair
we
wound
until
the
torch
fiery
tongue
amid
the
gushing
day
beamless
and
pallid
hung
they
raised
me
to
the
platform
of
the
pile
that
column
dizzy
height
the
grate
of
brass
through
which
they
thrust
me
open
stood
the
while
as
to
its
ponderous
and
suspended
mass
with
chains
which
eat
into
the
flesh
alas
with
brazen
links
my
naked
limbs
they
bound
the
grate
as
they
departed
to
repass
with
horrid
clangour
fell
and
the
far
sound
of
their
retiring
steps
in
the
dense
gloom
was
drowned
the
noon
was
calm
and
bright
around
that
column
the
overhanging
sky
and
circling
sea
spread
forth
in
silentness
profound
and
solemn
the
darkness
of
brief
frenzy
cast
on
me
so
that
i
knew
not
my
own
misery
the
islands
and
the
mountains
in
the
day
like
clouds
reposed
afar
and
i
could
see
the
town
among
the
woods
below
that
lay
and
the
dark
rocks
which
bound
the
bright
and
glassy
bay
it
was
so
calm
that
scarce
the
feathery
weed
sown
by
some
eagle
on
the
topmost
stone
swayed
in
the
air
so
bright
that
noon
did
breed
no
shadow
in
the
sky
beside
mine
own
mine
and
the
shadow
of
my
chain
alone
below
the
smoke
of
roofs
involved
in
flame
rested
like
night
all
else
was
clearly
shown
in
that
broad
glare
yet
sound
to
me
none
came
but
of
the
living
blood
that
ran
within
my
frame
the
peace
of
madness
fled
and
ah
too
soon
a
ship
was
lying
on
the
sunny
main
its
sails
were
flagging
in
the
breathless
noon
its
shadow
lay
beyond
that
sight
again
waked
with
its
presence
in
my
tranced
brain
the
stings
of
a
known
sorrow
keen
and
cold
i
knew
that
ship
bore
cythna
the
plain
of
waters
to
her
blighting
slavery
sold
and
watched
it
with
such
thoughts
as
must
remain
untold
i
watched
until
the
shades
of
evening
wrapped
earth
like
an
exhalation
then
the
bark
moved
for
that
calm
was
by
the
sunset
snapped
it
moved
a
speck
upon
the
ocean
dark
soon
the
wan
stars
came
forth
and
i
could
mark
its
path
no
more
i
sought
to
close
mine
eyes
but
like
the
balls
their
lids
were
stiff
and
stark
i
would
have
risen
but
ere
that
i
could
rise
my
parched
skin
was
split
with
piercing
agonies
i
gnawed
my
brazen
chain
and
sought
to
sever
its
adamantine
links
that
i
might
die
o
liberty
forgive
the
base
endeavour
forgive
me
if
reserved
for
victory
the
champion
of
thy
faith
sought
to
that
starry
night
with
its
clear
silence
sent
tameless
resolve
which
laughed
at
misery
into
my
soul
linked
remembrance
lent
to
that
such
power
to
me
such
a
severe
content
to
breathe
to
be
to
hope
or
to
despair
and
die
i
questioned
not
nor
though
the
sun
its
shafts
of
agony
kindling
through
the
air
moved
over
me
nor
though
in
evening
dun
or
when
the
stars
their
visible
courses
run
or
morning
the
wide
universe
was
spread
in
dreary
calmness
round
me
did
i
shun
its
presence
nor
seek
refuge
with
the
dead
from
one
faint
hope
whose
flower
a
dropping
poison
shed
two
days
thus
passed
i
neither
raved
nor
died
thirst
raged
within
me
like
a
scorpion
nest
built
in
mine
entrails
i
had
spurned
aside
the
while
despair
possessed
my
thoughts
and
now
no
drop
remained
the
uprest
of
the
third
sun
brought
hunger
but
the
crust
which
had
been
left
was
to
my
craving
breast
fuel
not
food
i
chewed
the
bitter
dust
and
bit
my
bloodless
arm
and
licked
the
brazen
rust
my
brain
began
to
fail
when
the
fourth
morn
burst
the
golden
isles
a
fearful
sleep
which
through
the
caverns
dreary
and
forlorn
of
the
riven
soul
sent
its
foul
dreams
to
sweep
with
whirlwind
swiftness
a
fall
far
and
deep
a
gulf
a
void
a
sense
of
senselessness
these
things
dwelt
in
me
even
as
shadows
keep
their
watch
in
some
dim
charnel
loneliness
a
shoreless
sea
a
sky
sunless
and
planetless
the
forms
which
peopled
this
terrific
trance
i
well
remember
like
a
choir
of
devils
around
me
they
involved
a
giddy
dance
legions
seemed
gathering
from
the
misty
levels
of
ocean
to
supply
those
ceaseless
revels
foul
ceaseless
shadows
thought
could
not
divide
the
actual
world
from
these
entangling
evils
which
so
bemocked
themselves
that
i
descried
all
shapes
like
mine
own
self
hideously
multiplied
the
sense
of
day
and
night
of
false
and
true
was
dead
within
me
yet
two
visions
burst
that
darkness
one
as
since
that
hour
i
knew
was
not
a
phantom
of
the
realms
accursed
where
then
my
spirit
dwelt
but
of
the
first
i
know
not
yet
was
it
a
dream
or
no
but
both
though
not
distincter
were
immersed
in
hues
which
when
through
memory
waste
they
flow
make
their
divided
streams
more
bright
and
rapid
now
methought
that
grate
was
lifted
and
the
seven
who
brought
me
thither
four
stiff
corpses
bare
and
from
the
frieze
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
hung
them
on
high
by
the
entangled
hair
swarthy
were
three
the
fourth
was
very
fair
as
they
retired
the
golden
moon
upsprung
and
eagerly
out
in
the
giddy
air
leaning
that
i
might
eat
i
stretched
and
clung
over
the
shapeless
depth
in
which
those
corpses
hung
a
woman
shape
now
lank
and
cold
and
blue
the
dwelling
of
the
worm
hung
there
the
white
and
hollow
cheek
i
drew
to
my
dry
lips
what
radiance
did
inform
those
horny
eyes
whose
was
that
withered
form
alas
alas
it
seemed
that
cythna
ghost
laughed
in
those
looks
and
that
the
flesh
was
warm
within
my
teeth
a
whirlwind
keen
as
frost
then
in
its
sinking
gulfs
my
sickening
spirit
tossed
then
seemed
it
that
a
tameless
hurricane
arose
and
bore
me
in
its
dark
career
beyond
the
sun
beyond
the
stars
that
wane
on
the
verge
of
formless
space
it
languished
there
and
dying
left
a
silence
lone
and
drear
more
horrible
than
famine
in
the
deep
the
shape
of
an
old
man
did
then
appear
stately
and
beautiful
that
dreadful
sleep
his
heavenly
smiles
dispersed
and
i
could
wake
and
weep
and
when
the
blinding
tears
had
fallen
i
saw
that
column
and
those
corpses
and
the
moon
and
felt
the
poisonous
tooth
of
hunger
gnaw
my
vitals
i
rejoiced
as
if
the
boon
of
senseless
death
would
be
accorded
soon
when
from
that
stony
gloom
a
voice
arose
solemn
and
sweet
as
when
low
winds
attune
the
midnight
pines
the
grate
did
then
unclose
and
on
that
reverend
form
the
moonlight
did
repose
he
struck
my
chains
and
gently
spake
and
smiled
as
they
were
loosened
by
that
hermit
old
mine
eyes
were
of
their
madness
half
beguiled
to
answer
those
kind
looks
he
did
enfold
his
giant
arms
around
me
to
uphold
my
wretched
frame
my
scorched
limbs
he
wound
in
linen
moist
and
balmy
and
as
cold
as
dew
to
drooping
leaves
the
chain
with
sound
like
earthquake
through
the
chasm
of
that
steep
stair
did
bound
as
lifting
me
it
fell
what
next
i
heard
were
billows
leaping
on
the
and
the
shrill
whose
breath
idly
stirred
my
hair
i
looked
abroad
and
saw
a
star
shining
beside
a
sail
and
distant
far
that
mountain
and
its
column
the
known
mark
of
those
who
in
the
wide
deep
wandering
are
so
that
i
feared
some
spirit
fell
and
dark
in
trance
had
lain
me
thus
within
a
fiendish
bark
for
now
indeed
over
the
salt
i
sailed
yet
dared
not
look
upon
the
shape
of
him
who
ruled
the
helm
although
the
pillow
for
my
light
head
was
hollowed
in
his
lap
and
my
bare
limbs
his
mantle
did
enwrap
fearing
it
was
a
fiend
at
last
he
bent
me
his
aged
face
as
if
to
snap
those
dreadful
thoughts
the
gentle
grandsire
bent
and
to
my
inmost
soul
his
soothing
looks
he
sent
a
soft
and
healing
potion
to
my
lips
at
intervals
he
raised
now
looked
on
high
to
mark
if
yet
the
starry
giant
dips
his
zone
in
the
dim
sea
now
cheeringly
though
he
said
little
did
he
speak
to
me
is
a
friend
beside
thee
take
good
cheer
poor
victim
thou
art
now
at
liberty
i
joyed
as
those
a
human
tone
to
hear
who
in
cells
deep
and
lone
have
languished
many
a
year
a
dim
and
feeble
joy
whose
glimpses
oft
were
quenched
in
a
relapse
of
wildering
dreams
yet
still
methought
we
sailed
until
aloft
the
stars
of
night
grew
pallid
and
the
beams
of
morn
descended
on
the
and
still
that
aged
man
so
grand
and
mild
tended
me
even
as
some
sick
mother
seems
to
hang
in
hope
over
a
dying
child
till
in
the
azure
east
darkness
again
was
piled
and
then
the
steaming
from
the
shore
sent
odours
dying
sweet
across
the
sea
and
the
swift
boat
the
little
waves
which
bore
were
cut
by
its
keen
keel
though
slantingly
soon
i
could
hear
the
leaves
sigh
and
could
see
the
starring
the
dim
grove
as
past
the
pebbly
beach
the
boat
did
flee
on
sidelong
wing
into
a
silent
cove
where
ebon
pines
a
shade
under
the
starlight
wove
notes
torches
editions
bent
meant
cj
nettleship
canto
the
old
man
took
the
oars
and
soon
the
bark
smote
on
the
beach
beside
a
tower
of
stone
it
was
a
crumbling
heap
whose
portal
dark
with
blooming
was
overgrown
upon
whose
floor
the
spangling
sands
were
strown
and
rarest
which
the
eternal
flood
slave
to
the
mother
of
the
months
had
thrown
within
the
walls
of
that
gray
tower
which
stood
a
changeling
of
man
art
nursed
amid
nature
brood
when
the
old
man
his
boat
had
anchored
he
wound
me
in
his
arms
with
tender
care
and
very
few
but
kindly
words
he
said
and
bore
me
through
the
tower
adown
a
stair
whose
smooth
descent
some
ceaseless
step
to
wear
for
many
a
year
had
we
came
at
last
to
a
small
chamber
which
with
mosses
rare
was
tapestried
where
me
his
soft
hands
placed
upon
a
couch
of
grass
and
interlaced
the
moon
was
darting
through
the
lattices
its
yellow
light
warm
as
the
beams
of
day
so
warm
that
to
admit
the
dewy
breeze
the
old
man
opened
them
the
moonlight
lay
upon
a
lake
whose
waters
wove
their
play
even
to
the
threshold
of
that
lonely
home
within
was
seen
in
the
dim
wavering
ray
the
antique
sculptured
roof
and
many
a
tome
whose
lore
had
made
that
sage
all
that
he
had
become
the
barrier
of
the
sea
was
past
and
i
was
on
the
margin
of
a
lake
a
lonely
lake
amid
the
forests
vast
and
snowy
mountains
did
my
spirit
wake
from
sleep
as
as
the
snake
that
girds
eternity
in
life
and
truth
might
not
my
heart
its
cravings
ever
slake
was
cythna
then
a
dream
and
all
my
youth
and
all
its
hopes
and
fears
and
all
its
joy
and
ruth
thus
madness
came
again
a
milder
madness
which
darkened
nought
but
time
unquiet
flow
with
supernatural
shades
of
clinging
sadness
that
gentle
hermit
in
my
helpless
woe
by
my
sick
couch
was
busy
to
and
fro
like
a
strong
spirit
ministrant
of
good
when
i
was
healed
he
led
me
forth
to
show
the
wonders
of
his
sylvan
solitude
and
we
together
sate
by
that
flood
he
knew
his
soothing
words
to
weave
with
skill
from
all
my
madness
told
like
mine
own
heart
of
cythna
would
he
question
me
until
that
thrilling
name
had
ceased
to
make
me
start
from
his
familiar
lips
it
was
not
art
of
wisdom
and
of
justice
when
he
spoke
when
mid
soft
looks
of
pity
there
would
dart
a
glance
as
keen
as
is
the
lightning
stroke
when
it
doth
rive
the
knots
of
some
ancestral
oak
thus
slowly
from
my
brain
the
darkness
rolled
my
thoughts
their
due
array
did
through
the
enchantments
of
that
hermit
old
then
i
bethought
me
of
the
glorious
doom
of
those
who
sternly
struggle
to
relume
the
lamp
of
hope
man
bewildered
lot
and
sitting
by
the
waters
in
the
gloom
of
eve
to
that
friend
heart
i
told
my
thought
that
heart
which
had
grown
old
but
had
corrupted
not
that
hoary
man
had
spent
his
livelong
age
in
converse
with
the
dead
who
leave
the
stamp
of
thoughts
on
many
a
page
when
they
are
gone
into
the
senseless
damp
of
graves
his
spirit
thus
became
a
lamp
of
splendour
like
to
those
on
which
it
fed
through
peopled
haunts
the
city
and
the
camp
deep
thirst
for
knowledge
had
his
footsteps
led
and
all
the
ways
of
men
among
mankind
he
read
but
custom
maketh
blind
and
obdurate
the
loftiest
hearts
he
had
beheld
the
woe
in
which
mankind
was
bound
but
deemed
that
fate
which
made
them
abject
would
preserve
them
so
and
in
such
faith
some
steadfast
joy
to
know
he
sought
this
cell
but
when
fame
went
abroad
that
one
in
argolis
did
undergo
torture
for
liberty
and
that
the
crowd
high
truths
from
gifted
lips
had
heard
and
understood
and
that
the
multitude
was
gathering
wide
his
spirit
leaped
within
his
aged
frame
in
lonely
peace
he
could
no
more
abide
but
to
the
land
on
which
the
victor
flame
had
fed
my
native
land
the
hermit
came
each
heart
was
there
a
shield
and
every
tongue
was
as
a
sword
of
truth
young
laon
name
rallied
their
secret
hopes
though
tyrants
sung
hymns
of
triumphant
joy
our
scattered
tribes
among
he
came
to
the
lone
column
on
the
rock
and
with
his
sweet
and
mighty
eloquence
the
hearts
of
those
who
watched
it
did
unlock
and
made
them
melt
in
tears
of
penitence
they
gave
him
entrance
free
to
bear
me
thence
this
the
old
man
said
years
are
spent
while
slowly
truth
on
thy
benighted
sense
has
crept
the
hope
which
wildered
it
has
lent
meanwhile
to
me
the
power
of
a
sublime
intent
from
the
records
of
my
youthful
state
and
from
the
lore
of
bards
and
sages
old
from
my
wakened
thoughts
create
out
of
the
hopes
of
thine
aspirings
bold
have
i
collected
language
to
unfold
truth
to
my
countrymen
from
shore
to
shore
doctrines
of
human
power
my
words
have
told
they
have
been
heard
and
men
aspire
to
more
than
they
have
ever
gained
or
ever
lost
of
yore
secret
chambers
parents
read
and
weep
my
writings
to
their
babes
no
longer
blind
and
young
men
gather
when
their
tyrants
sleep
and
vows
of
faith
each
to
the
other
bind
and
marriageable
maidens
who
have
pined
with
love
till
life
seemed
melting
through
their
look
a
warmer
zeal
a
nobler
hope
now
find
and
every
bosom
thus
is
rapt
and
shook
like
autumn
myriad
leaves
in
one
swoln
tyrants
of
the
golden
city
tremble
at
voices
which
are
heard
about
the
streets
the
ministers
of
fraud
can
scarce
dissemble
the
lies
of
their
own
heart
but
when
one
meets
another
at
the
shrine
he
inly
weets
though
he
says
nothing
that
the
truth
is
known
murderers
are
pale
upon
the
and
gold
grows
vile
even
to
the
wealthy
crone
and
laughter
fills
the
fane
and
curses
shake
the
throne
thoughts
and
mighty
hopes
and
gentle
deeds
abound
for
fearless
love
and
the
pure
law
of
mild
equality
and
peace
succeeds
to
faiths
which
long
have
held
the
world
in
awe
bloody
and
false
and
cold
as
whirlpools
draw
all
wrecks
of
ocean
to
their
chasm
the
sway
of
thy
strong
genius
laon
which
foresaw
this
hope
compels
all
spirits
to
obey
which
round
thy
secret
strength
now
throng
in
wide
array
i
have
been
thy
passive
instrument
as
thus
the
old
man
spake
his
countenance
gleamed
on
me
like
a
spirit
hast
lent
to
me
to
all
the
power
to
advance
towards
this
unforeseen
deliverance
from
our
ancestral
chains
ay
thou
didst
rear
that
lamp
of
hope
on
high
which
time
nor
chance
nor
change
may
not
extinguish
and
my
share
of
good
was
the
world
its
gathered
beams
to
bear
i
alas
am
both
unknown
and
old
and
though
the
woof
of
wisdom
i
know
well
to
dye
in
hues
of
language
i
am
cold
in
seeming
and
the
hopes
which
inly
dwell
my
manners
note
that
i
did
long
repel
but
laon
name
to
the
tumultuous
throng
were
like
the
star
whose
beams
the
waves
compel
and
tempests
and
his
tongue
were
as
a
lance
to
quell
the
mailed
crest
of
wrong
blood
need
not
flow
if
thou
at
length
wouldst
rise
perchance
the
very
slaves
would
spare
their
brethren
and
themselves
great
is
the
strength
of
words
for
lately
did
a
maiden
fair
who
from
her
childhood
has
been
taught
to
bear
the
tyrant
heaviest
yoke
arise
and
make
her
sex
the
law
of
truth
and
freedom
hear
and
with
these
quiet
words
for
thine
own
sake
i
prithee
spare
me
did
with
ruth
so
take
hearts
that
even
the
torturer
who
had
bound
her
meek
calm
frame
ere
it
was
yet
impaled
loosened
her
weeping
then
nor
could
be
found
one
human
hand
to
harm
her
unassailed
therefore
she
walks
through
the
great
city
veiled
in
virtue
adamantine
eloquence
scorn
and
death
and
pain
thus
trebly
mailed
and
blending
in
the
smiles
of
that
defence
the
serpent
and
the
dove
wisdom
and
innocence
women
throng
around
her
path
from
their
luxurious
dungeons
from
the
dust
of
meaner
thralls
from
the
oppressor
wrath
or
the
caresses
of
his
sated
lust
they
congregate
in
her
they
put
their
trust
the
tyrants
send
their
armed
slaves
to
quell
her
power
they
even
like
a
caught
by
some
forest
bend
beneath
the
spell
of
that
young
maiden
speech
and
to
their
chiefs
rebel
she
doth
equal
laws
and
justice
teach
to
woman
outraged
and
polluted
long
gathering
the
sweetest
fruit
in
human
reach
for
those
fair
hands
now
free
while
armed
wrong
trembles
before
her
look
though
it
be
strong
thousands
thus
dwell
beside
her
virgins
bright
and
matrons
with
their
babes
a
stately
throng
lovers
renew
the
vows
which
they
did
plight
in
early
faith
and
hearts
long
parted
now
unite
homeless
orphans

a
home
near
her
and
those
poor
victims
of
the
proud
no
less
fair
wrecks
on
whom
the
smiling
world
with
stir
thrusts
the
redemption
of
its
wickedness
in
squalid
huts
and
in
its
palaces
sits
lust
alone
while
the
land
is
borne
her
voice
whose
awful
sweetness
doth
repress
all
evil
and
her
foes
relenting
turn
and
cast
the
vote
of
love
in
hope
abandoned
urn
in
the
populous
city
a
young
maiden
has
baffled
havoc
of
the
prey
which
he
marks
as
his
own
with
chains
men
make
them
arms
to
hurl
down
tyranny
false
arbiter
between
the
bound
and
free
and
the
land
in
hamlets
and
in
towns
the
multitudes
collect
tumultuously
and
throng
in
arms
but
tyranny
disowns
their
claim
and
gathers
strength
around
its
trembling
thrones
soon
although
unwillingly
to
shed
the
free
can
not
forbear
the
queen
of
slaves
the
hoodwinked
angel
of
the
blind
and
dead
custom
with
iron
mace
points
to
the
graves
where
her
own
standard
desolately
waves
over
the
dust
of
prophets
and
of
kings
many
yet
stand
in
her
array
she
paves
her
path
with
human
hearts
and
it
flings
the
wildering
gloom
of
her
immeasurable
wings
is
a
plain
beneath
the
city
wall
bounded
by
misty
mountains
wide
and
vast
millions
there
lift
at
freedom
thrilling
call
ten
thousand
standards
wide
they
load
the
blast
which
bears
one
sound
of
many
voices
past
and
startles
on
his
throne
their
sceptred
foe
he
sits
amid
his
idle
pomp
aghast
and
that
his
power
hath
passed
away
doth
know
why
pause
the
victor
swords
to
seal
his
overthrow
tyrant
guards
resistance
yet
maintain
fearless
and
fierce
and
hard
as
beasts
of
blood
they

a
speck
amid
the
peopled
plain
carnage
and
ruin
have
been
made
their
food
from
infancy
ill
has
become
their
good
and
for
its
hateful
sake
their
will
has
wove
the
chains
which
eat
their
hearts
the
multitude
surrounding
them
with
words
of
human
love
seek
from
their
own
decay
their
stubborn
minds
to
move
the
land
is
felt
a
sudden
pause
as
night
and
day
those
ruthless
bands
around
the
watch
of
love
is
kept
a
trance
which
awes
the
thoughts
of
men
with
hope
as
when
the
sound
of
whirlwind
whose
fierce
blasts
the
waves
and
clouds
confound
dies
suddenly
the
mariner
in
fear
feels
silence
sink
upon
his
heart
thus
bound
the
conquerors
pause
and
oh
may
freemen
clasp
the
relentless
knees
of
dread
the
murderer
blood
be
shed

but
a
change
and
choice
of
bonds
from
slavery
to
cowardice
a
wretched
fall
uplift
thy
charmed
voice
pour
on
those
evil
men
the
love
that
lies
hovering
within
those
eyes
arise
my
friend
farewell
as
thus
he
spake
from
the
green
earth
lightly
i
did
arise
as
one
out
of
dim
dreams
that
doth
awake
and
looked
upon
the
depth
of
that
reposing
lake
i
saw
my
countenance
reflected
there
and
then
my
youth
fell
on
me
like
a
wind
descending
on
still
waters
my
thin
hair
was
prematurely
gray
my
face
was
lined
with
channels
such
as
suffering
leaves
behind
not
age
my
brow
was
pale
but
in
my
cheek
and
lips
a
flush
of
gnawing
fire
did
find
their
food
and
dwelling
though
mine
eyes
might
speak
a
subtle
mind
and
strong
within
a
frame
thus
weak
and
though
their
lustre
now
was
spent
and
faded
yet
in
my
hollow
looks
and
withered
mien
the
likeness
of
a
shape
for
which
was
braided
the
brightest
woof
of
genius
still
was
seen
one
who
methought
had
gone
from
the
world
scene
and
left
it
vacant
was
her
lover
face
it
might
resemble
her
it
once
had
been
the
mirror
of
her
thoughts
and
still
the
grace
which
her
mind
shadow
cast
left
there
a
lingering
trace
what
then
was
i
she
slumbered
with
the
dead
glory
and
joy
and
peace
had
come
and
gone
doth
the
cloud
perish
when
the
beams
are
fled
which
steeped
its
skirts
in
gold
or
dark
and
lone
doth
it
not
through
the
paths
of
night
unknown
on
outspread
wings
of
its
own
wind
upborne
pour
rain
upon
the
earth
the
stars
are
shown
when
the
cold
moon
sharpens
her
silver
horn
under
the
sea
and
make
the
wide
night
not
forlorn
strengthened
in
heart
yet
sad
that
aged
man
i
left
with
interchange
of
looks
and
tears
and
lingering
speech
and
to
the
camp
began
my
war
many
a
which
rears
its
hundred
crests
aloft
my
spirit
bears
my
frame
many
a
dale
and
many
a
moor
and
gaily
now
meseems
serene
earth
wears
the
blosmy
spring
investiture
a
vision
which
aught
sad
from
sadness
might
allure
my
powers
revived
within
me
and
i
went
as
one
whom
winds
waft
the
bending
grass
through
many
a
vale
of
that
broad
continent
at
night
when
i
reposed
fair
dreams
did
pass
before
my
pillow
my
own
cythna
was
not
like
a
child
of
death
among
them
ever
when
i
arose
from
rest
a
woful
mass
that
gentlest
sleep
seemed
from
my
life
to
sever
as
if
the
light
of
youth
were
not
withdrawn
for
ever
aye
as
i
went
that
maiden
who
had
reared
the
torch
of
truth
afar
of
whose
high
deeds
the
hermit
in
his
pilgrimage
had
heard
haunted
my
ah
hope
its
sickness
feeds
with
it
finds
or
flowers
or
weeds
could
she
be
cythna
was
that
corpse
a
shade
such
as
thought
from
madness
breeds
why
was
this
hope
not
torture
yet
it
made
a
light
around
my
steps
which
would
not
ever
fade
notes
where
when
edition
canto
over
the
utmost
hill
at
length
i
sped
a
snowy
steep
the
moon
was
hanging
low
over
the
asian
mountains
and
outspread
the
plain
the
city
and
the
camp
below
skirted
the
midnight
ocean
glimmering
flow
the
city
moonlit
spires
and
myriad
lamps
like
stars
in
a
sublunar
sky
did
glow
and
fires
blazed
far
amid
the
scattered
camps
like
springs
of
flame
which
burst
swift
earthquake
stamps
all
slept
but
those
in
watchful
arms
who
stood
and
those
who
sate
tending
the
beacon
light
and
the
few
sounds
from
that
vast
multitude
made
silence
more
oh
what
a
might
of
human
thought
was
cradled
in
that
night
how
many
hearts
impenetrably
veiled
beat
underneath
its
shade
what
secret
fight
evil
and
good
in
woven
passions
mailed
waged
through
that
silent
throng
a
war
that
never
failed
and
now
the
power
of
good
held
victory
so
through
the
labyrinth
of
many
a
tent
among
the
silent
millions
who
did
lie
in
innocent
sleep
exultingly
i
went
the
moon
had
left
heaven
desert
now
but
lent
from
eastern
morn
the
first
faint
lustre
showed
an
armed
youth
over
his
spear
he
bent
his
downward
friend
i
cried
aloud
and
quickly
common
hopes
made
freemen
understood
i
sate
beside
him
while
the
morning
beam
crept
slowly
over
heaven
and
talked
with
him
of
those
immortal
hopes
a
glorious
theme
which
led
us
forth
until
the
stars
grew
dim
and
all
the
while
methought
his
voice
did
swim
as
if
it
drowned
in
remembrance
were
of
thoughts
which
make
the
moist
eyes
overbrim
at
last
when
daylight
to
fill
the
air
he
looked
on
me
and
cried
in
wonder
art
here
then
suddenly
i
knew
it
was
the
youth
in
whom
its
earliest
hopes
my
spirit
found
but
envious
tongues
had
stained
his
spotless
truth
and
thoughtless
pride
his
love
in
silence
bound
and
shame
and
sorrow
mine
in
toils
had
wound
whilst
he
was
innocent
and
i
deluded
the
truth
now
came
upon
me
on
the
ground
tears
of
repenting
joy
which
fast
intruded
fell
fast
and
its
peace
our
mingling
spirits
brooded
thus
while
with
rapid
lips
and
earnest
eyes
we
talked
a
sound
of
sweeping
conflict
spread
as
from
the
earth
did
suddenly
arise
from
every
tent
roused
by
that
clamour
dread
our
bands
outsprung
and
seized
their
arms
we
sped
towards
the
sound
our
tribes
were
gathering
far
those
sanguine
slaves
amid
ten
thousand
dead
stabbed
in
their
sleep
trampled
in
treacherous
war
the
gentle
hearts
whose
power
their
lives
had
sought
to
spare
like
rabid
snakes
that
sting
some
gentle
child
who
brings
them
food
when
winter
false
and
fair
allures
them
forth
with
its
cold
smiles
so
wild
they
rage
among
the
camp
they
overbear
the
patriot
hosts
confusion
then
despair
descends
like
night
when
one
did
cry
like
a
bright
ghost
from
heaven
that
shout
did
scare
the
slaves
and
widening
through
the
vaulted
sky
seemed
sent
from
earth
to
heaven
in
sign
of
victory
in
sudden
panic
those
false
murderers
fled
like
insect
tribes
before
the
northern
gale
but
swifter
still
our
hosts
encompassed
their
shattered
ranks
and
in
a
craggy
vale
where
even
their
fierce
despair
might
nought
avail
hemmed
them
around
and
then
revenge
and
fear
made
the
high
virtue
of
the
patriots
fail
one
pointed
on
his
foe
the
mortal
spear
i
rushed
before
its
point
and
cried
forbear
the
spear
transfixed
my
arm
that
was
uplifted
in
swift
expostulation
and
the
blood
gushed
round
its
point
i
smiled
and
thou
gifted
with
eloquence
which
shall
not
be
withstood
flow
thus
i
cried
in
joy
vital
flood
until
my
heart
be
dry
ere
thus
the
cause
for
which
thou
wert
aught
worthy
be
subdued
ah
ye
are
pale
ye
weep
your
passions
pause
well
ye
feel
the
truth
of
love
benignant
laws
our
brethren
and
our
friends
are
slain
ye
murdered
them
i
think
as
they
did
sleep
alas
what
have
ye
done
the
slightest
pain
which
ye
might
suffer
there
were
eyes
to
weep
but
ye
have
quenched
them
there
were
smiles
to
steep
your
hearts
in
balm
but
they
are
lost
in
woe
and
those
whom
love
did
set
his
watch
to
keep
around
your
tents
truth
freedom
to
bestow
ye
stabbed
as
they
did
sleep
but
they
forgive
ye
now
wherefore
should
ill
ever
flow
from
ill
and
pain
still
keener
pain
for
ever
breed
we
all
are
brethren
even
the
slaves
who
kill
for
hire
are
men
and
to
avenge
misdeed
on
the
misdoer
doth
but
misery
feed
with
her
own
broken
heart
o
earth
o
heaven
and
thou
dread
nature
which
to
every
deed
and
all
that
lives
or
is
to
be
hath
given
even
as
to
thee
have
these
done
ill
and
are
forgiven
then
your
hands
and
hearts
and
let
the
past
be
as
a
grave
which
gives
not
up
its
dead
to
evil
thoughts
a
film
then
overcast
my
sense
with
dimness
for
the
wound
which
bled
freshly
swift
shadows
mine
eyes
had
shed
when
i
awoke
i
lay
mid
friends
and
foes
and
earnest
countenances
on
me
shed
the
light
of
questioning
looks
whilst
one
did
close
my
wound
with
balmiest
herbs
and
soothed
me
to
repose
and
one
whose
spear
had
pierced
me
leaned
beside
with
quivering
lips
and
humid
eyes
and
all
seemed
like
some
brothers
on
a
journey
wide
gone
forth
whom
now
strange
meeting
did
befall
in
a
strange
land
round
one
whom
they
might
call
their
friend
their
chief
their
father
for
assay
of
peril
which
had
saved
them
from
the
thrall
of
death
now
suffering
thus
the
vast
array
of
those
fraternal
bands
were
reconciled
that
day
lifting
the
thunder
of
their
acclamation
towards
the
city
then
the
multitude
and
i
among
them
went
in
joy
a
nation
made
free
by
love
a
mighty
brotherhood
linked
by
a
jealous
interchange
of
good
a
glorious
pageant
more
magnificent
than
kingly
slaves
arrayed
in
gold
and
blood
when
they
return
from
carnage
and
are
sent
in
triumph
bright
beneath
the
populous
battlement
afar
the
were
thronged
on
high
and
myriads
on
each
giddy
turret
clung
and
to
each
spire
far
lessening
in
the
sky
bright
pennons
on
the
idle
winds
were
hung
as
we
approached
a
shout
of
joyance
sprung
at
once
from
all
the
crowd
as
if
the
vast
and
peopled
earth
its
boundless
skies
among
the
sudden
clamour
of
delight
had
cast
when
from
before
its
face
some
general
wreck
had
passed
our
armies
through
the
city
hundred
gates
were
poured
like
brooks
which
to
the
rocky
lair
of
some
deep
lake
whose
silence
them
awaits
throng
from
the
mountains
when
the
storms
are
there
and
as
we
passed
through
the
calm
sunny
air
a
thousand
crowns
were
shed
the
token
flowers
of
truth
and
freedom
fair
and
fairest
hands
bound
them
on
many
a
head
those
angels
of
love
heaven
that
over
all
was
spread
i
trod
as
one
tranced
in
some
rapturous
vision
those
bloody
bands
so
lately
reconciled
were
ever
as
they
went
by
the
contrition
of
anger
turned
to
love
from
ill
beguiled
and
every
one
on
them
more
gently
smiled
because
they
had
done
evil
the
sweet
awe
of
such
mild
looks
made
their
own
hearts
grow
mild
and
did
with
soft
attraction
ever
draw
their
spirits
to
the
love
of
freedom
equal
law
and
they
and
all
in
one
loud
symphony
my
name
with
liberty
commingling
lifted
friend
and
the
preserver
of
the
free
the
parent
of
this
joy
and
fair
eyes
gifted
with
feelings
caught
from
one
who
had
uplifted
the
light
of
a
great
spirit
round
me
shone
and
all
the
shapes
of
this
grand
scenery
shifted
like
restless
clouds
before
the
steadfast
sun
where
was
that
maid
i
asked
but
it
was
known
of
none
laone
was
the
name
her
love
had
chosen
for
she
was
nameless
and
her
birth
none
knew
where
was
laone
now
the
words
were
frozen
within
my
lips
with
fear
but
to
subdue
such
dreadful
hope
to
my
great
task
was
due
and
when
at
length
one
brought
reply
that
she
would
appear
i
then
withdrew
to
judge
what
need
for
that
great
throng
might
be
for
now
the
stars
came
thick
over
the
twilight
sea
yet
need
was
none
for
rest
or
food
to
care
even
though
that
multitude
was
passing
great
since
each
one
for
the
other
did
prepare
all
kindly
succour
therefore
to
the
gate
of
the
imperial
house
now
desolate
i
passed
and
there
was
found
aghast
alone
the
fallen
tyrant
silently
he
sate
upon
the
footstool
of
his
golden
throne
which
starred
with
sunny
gems
in
its
own
lustre
shone
alone
but
for
one
child
who
led
before
him
a
graceful
dance
the
only
living
thing
of
all
the
crowd
which
thither
to
adore
him
flocked
yesterday
who
solace
sought
to
bring
in
his
abandonment
she
knew
the
king
had
praised
her
dance
of
yore
and
now
she
wove
its
circles
aye
weeping
and
murmuring
mid
her
sad
task
of
unregarded
love
that
to
no
smiles
it
might
his
speechless
sadness
move
she
fled
to
him
and
wildly
clasped
his
feet
when
human
steps
were
heard
he
moved
nor
spoke
nor
changed
his
hue
nor
raised
his
looks
to
meet
the
gaze
of
strangers
our
loud
entrance
woke
the
echoes
of
the
hall
which
circling
broke
the
calm
of
its
recesses
like
a
tomb
its
sculptured
walls
vacantly
to
the
stroke
of
footfalls
answered
and
the
twilight
gloom
lay
like
a
charnel
mist
within
the
radiant
dome
the
little
child
stood
up
when
we
came
nigh
her
lips
and
cheeks
seemed
very
pale
and
wan
but
on
her
forehead
and
within
her
eye
lay
beauty
which
makes
hearts
that
feed
thereon
sick
with
excess
of
sweetness
on
the
throne
she
leaned
the
king
with
gathered
brow
and
lips
wreathed
by
long
scorn
did
inly
sneer
and
frown
with
hue
like
that
when
some
great
painter
dips
his
pencil
in
the
gloom
of
earthquake
and
eclipse
she
stood
beside
him
like
a
rainbow
braided
within
some
storm
when
scarce
its
shadows
vast
from
the
blue
paths
of
the
swift
sun
have
faded
a
sweet
and
solemn
smile
like
cythna
cast
one
moment
light
which
made
my
heart
beat
fast
that
child
parted
lips
a
gleam
of
bliss
a
shade
of
vanished
days
as
the
tears
passed
which
wrapped
it
even
as
with
a
father
kiss
i
pressed
those
softest
eyes
in
trembling
tenderness
the
sceptred
wretch
then
from
that
solitude
i
drew
and
of
his
change
compassionate
with
words
of
sadness
soothed
his
rugged
mood
but
he
while
pride
and
fear
held
deep
debate
with
sullen
guile
of
hate
glared
on
me
as
a
toothless
snake
might
glare
pity
not
scorn
i
felt
though
desolate
the
desolator
now
and
unaware
the
curses
which
he
mocked
had
caught
him
by
the
hair
i
led
him
forth
from
that
which
now
might
seem
a
gorgeous
grave
through
portals
sculptured
deep
with
imagery
beautiful
as
dream
we
went
and
left
the
shades
which
tend
on
sleep
over
its
unregarded
gold
to
keep
their
silent
the
child
trod
faintingly
and
as
she
went
the
tears
which
she
did
weep
glanced
in
the
starlight
wildered
seemed
she
and
when
i
spake
for
sobs
she
could
not
answer
me
at
last
the
tyrant
cried
hungers
slave
stab
her
or
give
her
bread
it
was
a
tone
such
as
sick
fancies
in
a
grave
might
hear
i
trembled
for
the
truth
was
known
he
with
this
child
had
thus
been
left
alone
and
neither
had
gone
forth
for
food
but
he
in
mingled
pride
and
awe
cowered
near
his
throne
and
she
a
nursling
of
captivity
knew
nought
beyond
those
walls
nor
what
such
change
might
be
and
he
was
troubled
at
a
charm
withdrawn
thus
suddenly
that
sceptres
ruled
no
more
that
even
from
gold
the
dreadful
strength
was
gone
which
once
made
all
things
subject
to
its
power
such
wonder
seized
him
as
if
hour
by
hour
the
past
had
come
again
and
the
swift
fall
of
one
so
great
and
terrible
of
yore
to
desolateness
in
the
hearts
of
all
like
wonder
stirred
who
saw
such
awful
change
befall
a
mighty
crowd
such
as
the
wide
land
pours
once
in
a
thousand
years
now
gathered
round
the
fallen
tyrant
like
the
rush
of
showers
of
hail
in
spring
pattering
along
the
ground
their
many
footsteps
fell
else
came
no
sound
from
the
wide
multitude
that
lonely
man
then
knew
the
burden
of
his
change
and
found
concealing
in
the
dust
his
visage
wan
refuge
from
the
keen
looks
which
through
his
bosom
ran
and
he
was
faint
withal
i
sate
beside
him
upon
the
earth
and
took
that
child
so
fair
from
his
weak
arms
that
ill
might
none
betide
him
or
her
when
food
was
brought
to
them
her
share
to
his
averted
lips
the
child
did
bear
but
when
she
saw
he
had
enough
she
ate
and
wept
the
while
the
lonely
man
despair
hunger
then
overcame
and
of
his
state
forgetful
on
the
dust
as
in
a
trance
he
sate
slowly
the
silence
of
the
multitudes
passed
as
when
far
is
heard
in
some
lone
dell
the
gathering
of
a
wind
among
the
woods
he
is
fallen
they
cry
who
did
dwell
like
famine
or
the
plague
or
aught
more
fell
among
our
homes
is
fallen
the
murderer
who
slaked
his
thirsting
soul
as
from
a
well
of
blood
and
tears
with
ruin
he
is
here
sunk
in
a
gulf
of
scorn
from
which
none

him
rear
then
was
heard
who
judged
let
him
be
brought
to
judgement
blood
for
blood
cries
from
the
soil
on
which
his
crimes
have
deep
pollution
wrought
shall
othman
only
unavenged
despoil
shall
they
who
by
the
stress
of
grinding
toil
wrest
from
the
unwilling
earth
his
luxuries
perish
for
crime
while
his
foul
blood
may
boil
or
creep
within
his
veins
at

and
to
high
justice
make
her
chosen
sacrifice
do
ye
seek
what
fear
ye
then
i
cried
suddenly
starting
forth
ye
should
shed
the
blood
of
othman
if
your
hearts
are
tried
in
the
true
love
of
freedom
cease
to
dread
this
one
poor
lonely
man
beneath
heaven
spread
in
purest
light
above
us
all
through
earth
maternal
earth
who
doth
her
sweet
smiles
shed
for
all
let
him
go
free
until
the
worth
of
human
nature
win
from
these
a
second
birth
call
ye
justice
is
there
one
who
in
secret
thought
has
wished
another
ill
are
ye
all
pure
let
those
stand
forth
who
hear
and
tremble
not
shall
they
insult
and
kill
if
such
they
be
their
mild
eyes
can
they
fill
with
the
false
anger
of
the
hypocrite
alas
such
were
not
pure
the
chastened
will
of
virtue
sees
that
justice
is
the
light
of
love
and
not
revenge
and
terror
and
despite
the
murmur
of
the
people
slowly
dying
paused
as
i
spake
then
those
who
near
me
were
cast
gentle
looks
where
the
lone
man
was
lying
shrouding
his
head
which
now
that
infant
fair
clasped
on
her
lap
in
silence
through
the
air
sobs
were
then
heard
and
many
kissed
my
feet
in
pity
madness
and
to
the
despair
of
him
whom
late
they
cursed
a
solace
sweet
his
very
victims
brought
soft
looks
and
speeches
meet
then
to
a
home
for
his
repose
assigned
accompanied
by
the
still
throng
he
went
in
silence
where
to
soothe
his
rankling
mind
some
likeness
of
his
ancient
state
was
lent
and
if
his
heart
could
have
been
innocent
as
those
who
pardoned
him
he
might
have
ended
his
days
in
peace
but
his
straight
lips
were
bent
men
said
into
a
smile
which
guile
portended
a
sight
with
which
that
child
like
hope
with
fear
was
blended
was
midnight
now
the
eve
of
that
great
day
whereon
the
many
nations
at
whose
call
the
chains
of
earth
like
mist
melted
away
decreed
to
hold
a
sacred
festival
a
rite
to
attest
the
equality
of
all
who
live
so
to
their
homes
to
dream
or
wake
all
went
the
sleepless
silence
did
recall
laone
to
my
thoughts
with
hopes
that
make
the
flood
recede
from
which
their
thirst
they
seek
to
slake
the
dawn
flowed
forth
and
from
its
purple
fountains
i
drank
those
hopes
which
make
the
spirit
quail
as
to
the
plain
between
the
misty
mountains
and
the
great
city
with
a
countenance
pale
i
went
it
was
a
sight
which
might
avail
to
make
men
weep
exulting
tears
for
whom
now
first
from
human
power
the
reverend
veil
was
torn
to
see
earth
from
her
general
womb
pour
forth
her
swarming
sons
to
a
fraternal
doom
to
see
far
glancing
in
the
misty
morning
the
signs
of
that
innumerable
host
to
hear
one
sound
of
many
made
the
warning
of
earth
to
heaven
from
its
free
children
tossed
while
the
eternal
hills
and
the
sea
lost
in
wavering
light
and
starring
the
blue
sky
the
city
myriad
spires
of
gold
almost
with
human
joy
made
mute
society
its
witnesses
with
men
who
must
hereafter
be
to
see
like
some
vast
island
from
the
ocean
the
altar
of
the
federation
rear
its
pile
i
the
midst
a
work
which
the
devotion
of
millions
in
one
night
created
there
sudden
as
when
the
moonrise
makes
appear
strange
clouds
in
the
east
a
marble
pyramid
distinct
with
steps
that
mighty
shape
did
wear
the
light
of
genius
its
still
shadow
hid
far
ships
to
know
its
height
the
morning
mists
forbid
to
hear
the
restless
multitudes
for
ever
around
the
base
of
that
great
altar
flow
as
on
some
burst
and
shiver
atlantic
waves
and
solemnly
and
slow
as
the
wind
bore
that
tumult
to
and
fro
to
feel
the
dreamlike
music
which
did
swim
like
beams
through
floating
clouds
on
waves
below
falling
in
pauses
from
that
altar
dim
as
tongues
breathed
an
aerial
hymn
to
hear
to
see
to
live
was
on
that
morn
lethean
joy
so
that
all
those
assembled
cast
off
their
memories
of
the
past
outworn
two
only
bosoms
with
their
own
life
trembled
and
mine
was
one
and
we
had
both
dissembled
so
with
a
beating
heart
i
went
and
one
who
having
much
covets
yet
more
resembled
a
lost
and
dear
possession
which
not
won
he
walks
in
lonely
gloom
beneath
the
noonday
sun
to
the
great
pyramid
i
came
its
stair
with
female
choirs
was
thronged
the
loveliest
among
the
free
grouped
with
its
sculptures
rare
as
i
approached
the
morning
golden
mist
which
now
the
breezes
kissed
with
their
cold
lips
fled
and
the
summit
shone
like
athos
seen
from
samothracia
dressed
in
earliest
light
by
vintagers
and
one
sate
there
a
female
shape
upon
an
ivory
throne
a
form
most
like
the
imagined
habitant
of
silver
exhalations
sprung
from
dawn
by
winds
which
feed
on
sunrise
woven
to
enchant
the
faiths
of
men
all
mortal
eyes
were
drawn
as
famished
mariners
through
strange
seas
gone
gaze
on
a
burning
by
the
light
of
those
divinest
lineaments
alone
with
thoughts
which
none
could
share
from
that
fair
sight
i
turned
in
sickness
for
a
veil
shrouded
her
countenance
bright
and
neither
did
i
hear
the
acclamations
which
from
brief
silence
bursting
filled
the
air
with
her
strange
name
and
mine
from
all
the
nations
which
we
they
said
in
strength
had
gathered
there
from
the
sleep
of
bondage
nor
the
vision
fair
of
that
bright
pageantry
beheld
but
blind
and
silent
as
a
breathing
corpse
did
fare
leaning
upon
my
friend
till
like
a
wind
to
fevered
cheeks
a
voice
flowed
my
troubled
mind
like
music
of
some
minstrel
heavenly
gifted
to
one
whom
fiends
enthral
this
voice
to
me
scarce
did
i
wish
her
veil
to
be
uplifted
i
was
so
calm
and
i
could
see
the
platform
where
we
stood
the
statues
three
which
kept
their
marble
watch
on
that
high
shrine
the
multitudes
the
mountains
and
the
sea
as
when
eclipse
hath
passed
things
sudden
shine
to
men
astonished
eyes
most
clear
and
crystalline
at
first
laone
spoke
most
tremulously
but
soon
her
voice
the
calmness
which
it
shed
gathered
and
art
whom
i
sought
to
see
and
thou
art
our
first
votary
here
she
said
had
a
dear
friend
once
but
he
is
dead
and
of
all
those
on
the
wide
earth
who
breathe
thou
dost
resemble
him
alone
i
spread
this
veil
between
us
two
that
thou
beneath
shouldst
image
one
who
may
have
been
long
lost
in
death
this
wilt
thou
not
henceforth
pardon
me
yes
but
those
joys
which
silence
well
requite
forbid
reply
why
men
have
chosen
me
to
be
the
priestess
of
this
holiest
rite
i
scarcely
know
but
that
the
floods
of
light
which
flow
over
the
world
have
borne
me
hither
to
meet
thee
long
most
dear
and
now
unite
thine
hand
with
mine
and
may
all
comfort
wither
from
both
the
hearts
whose
pulse
in
joy
now
beat
together
our
own
will
as
others
law
we
bind
if
the
foul
worship
trampled
here
we
fear
if
as
ourselves
we
cease
to
love
our
kind
she
paused
and
pointed
upwards
sculptured
there
three
shapes
around
her
ivory
throne
appear
one
was
a
giant
like
a
child
asleep
on
a
loose
rock
whose
grasp
crushed
as
it
were
in
dream
sceptres
and
crowns
and
one
did
keep
its
watchful
eyes
in
doubt
whether
to
smile
or
weep
a
woman
sitting
on
the
sculptured
disk
of
the
broad
earth
and
feeding
from
one
breast
a
human
babe
and
a
young
basilisk
her
looks
were
sweet
as
heaven
when
loveliest
in
autumn
eves
the
third
image
was
dressed
in
white
wings
swift
as
clouds
in
winter
skies
beneath
his
feet
ghastliest
forms
repressed
lay
faith
an
obscene
worm
who
sought
to
rise
while
calmly
on
the
sun
he
turned
his
diamond
eyes
beside
that
image
then
i
sate
while
she
stood
mid
the
throngs
which
ever
ebbed
and
flowed
like
light
amid
the
shadows
of
the
sea
cast
from
one
cloudless
star
and
on
the
crowd
that
touch
which
none
who
feels
forgets
bestowed
and
whilst
the
sun
returned
the
steadfast
gaze
of
the
great
image
as
heaven
it
glode
that
rite
had
place
it
ceased
when
sunset
blaze
burned
the
isles
all
stood
in
joy
and
deep
amaze
when
in
the
silence
of
all
spirits
there
laone
voice
was
felt
and
through
the
air
her
thrilling
gestures
spoke
most
eloquently
fair
art
thou
as
yon
sunset
swift
and
strong
as
eagles
beautiful
and
young
that
float
among
the
blinding
beams
of
morning
and
underneath
thy
feet
writhe
faith
and
folly
custom
and
hell
and
mortal
melancholy
hark
the
earth
starts
to
hear
the
mighty
warning
of
thy
voice
sublime
and
holy
its
free
spirits
here
assembled
see
thee

thee

thee
now
to
thy
voice
their

trembled

ten
thousand
clouds

wide
wind
as
it
flies

thy
irresistible
children

to
hail
thee

like

spirit
through
the
darkness
shining
in
tones
whose
sweetness
silence
did
prolong
as
if
to
lingering
winds
they
did
belong
poured
forth
her
inmost
soul
a
passionate
speech
with
wild
and
thrilling
pauses
woven
among
which
whoso
heard
was
mute
for
it
could
teach
to
rapture
like
her
own
all
listening
hearts
to
reach
her
voice
was
as
a
mountain
stream
which
sweeps
the
withered
leaves
of
autumn
to
the
lake
and
in
some
deep
and
narrow
bay
then
sleeps
in
the
shadow
of
the
shores
as
dead
leaves
wake
under
the
wave
in
flowers
and
herbs
which
make
those
green
depths
beautiful
when
skies
are
blue
the
multitude
so
moveless
did
partake
such
living
change
and
kindling
murmurs
flew
as
that
speechless
calm
delight
and
wonder
grew
over
the
plain
the
throngs
were
scattered
then
in
groups
around
the
fires
which
from
the
sea
even
to
the
gorge
of
the
first
blazed
wide
and
far
the
banquet
of
the
free
was
spread
beneath
many
a
dark
beneath
whose
spires
which
swayed
in
the
red
flame
reclining
as
they
ate
of
liberty
and
hope
and
justice
and
laone
name
earth
children
did
a
woof
of
happy
converse
frame
their
feast
was
such
as
earth
the
general
mother
pours
from
her
fairest
bosom
when
she
smiles
in
the
embrace
of
autumn
to
each
other
as
when
some
parent
fondly
reconciles
her
warring
children
she
their
wrath
beguiles
with
her
own
sustenance
they
relenting
weep
such
was
this
festival
which
from
their
isles
and
continents
and
winds
and
oceans
deep
all
shapes
might
throng
to
share
that
fly
or
walk
or
creep
might
share
in
peace
and
innocence
for
gore
or
poison
none
this
festal
did
pollute
but
piled
on
high
an
overflowing
store
of
pomegranates
and
citrons
fairest
fruit
melons
and
dates
and
figs
and
many
a
root
sweet
and
sustaining
and
bright
grapes
ere
yet
accursed
fire
their
mild
juice
could
transmute
into
a
mortal
bane
and
brown
corn
set
in
baskets
with
pure
streams
their
thirsting
lips
they
wet
laone
had
descended
from
the
shrine
and
every
deepest
look
and
holiest
mind
fed
on
her
form
though
now
those
tones
divine
were
silent
as
she
passed
she
did
unwind
her
veil
as
with
the
crowds
of
her
own
kind
she
mixed
some
impulse
made
my
heart
refrain
from
seeking
her
that
night
so
i
reclined
amidst
a
group
where
on
the
utmost
plain
a
festal
watchfire
burned
beside
the
dusky
main
and
joyous
was
our
feast
pathetic
talk
and
wit
and
harmony
of
choral
strains
while
far
orion
the
waves
did
walk
that
flow
among
the
isles
held
us
in
chains
of
sweet
captivity
which
none
disdains
who
feels
but
when
his
zone
grew
dim
in
mist
which
clothes
the
ocean
bosom
the
plains
the
multitudes
went
homeward
to
their
rest
which
that
delightful
day
with
its
own
shadow
blessed
notes
flame
light
edition
canto
beside
the
dimness
of
the
glimmering
sea
weaving
swift
language
from
impassioned
themes
with
that
dear

lingered
who
to
me
so
late
had
been
restored
beneath
the
gleams
of
the
silver
stars
and
ever
in
soft
dreams
of
future
love
and
peace
sweet
converse
lapped
our
willing
fancies
till
the
pallid
beams
of
the
last
watchfire
fell
and
darkness
wrapped
the
waves
and
each
bright
chain
of
floating
fire
was
snapped
and
till
we
came
even
to
the
city
wall
and
the
great
gate
then
none
knew
whence
or
why
disquiet
on
the
multitudes
did
fall
and
first
one
pale
and
breathless
passed
us
by
and
stared
and
spoke
not
then
with
piercing
cry
a
troop
of
women
by
the
shrieks
of
their
own
terror
driven
tumultuously
hither
and
thither
hurrying
with
pale
cheeks
each
one
from
fear
unknown
a
sudden
refuge
seeks
then
rallying
cries
of
treason
and
of
danger
resounded
and
come
to
arms
to
arms
the
tyrant
is
amongst
us
and
the
stranger
comes
to
enslave
us
in
his
name
to
arms
in
vain
for
panic
the
pale
fiend
who
charms
strength
to
forswear
her
right
those
millions
swept
like
waves
before
the
tempest
these
alarms
came
to
me
as
to
know
their
cause
i
lept
on
the
gate
turret
and
in
rage
and
grief
and
scorn
i
wept
for
to
the
north
i
saw
the
town
on
fire
and
its
red
light
made
morning
pallid
now
which
burst
over
wide
asia
louder
higher
the
yells
of
victory
and
the
screams
of
woe
i
heard
approach
and
saw
the
throng
below
stream
through
the
gates
like
waterfalls
fed
from
a
thousand
storms
the
fearful
glow
of
bombs
flares
overhead
at
intervals
the
red
artillery
bolt
mangling
among
them
falls
and
now
the
horsemen
come
and
all
was
done
swifter
than
i
have
spoken
i
beheld
their
red
swords
flash
in
the
unrisen
sun
i
rushed
among
the
rout
to
have
repelled
that
miserable
flight
one
moment
quelled
by
voice
and
looks
and
eloquent
despair
as
if
reproach
from
their
own
hearts
withheld
their
steps
they
stood
but
soon
came
pouring
there
new
multitudes
and
did
those
rallied
bands
i
strove
as
drifted
on
some
cataract
by
irresistible
streams
some
wretch
might
strive
who
hears
its
fatal
roar
the
files
compact
whelmed
me
and
from
the
gate
availed
to
drive
with
quickening
impulse
as
each
bolt
did
rive
their
ranks
with
bloodier
chasm
into
the
plain
disgorged
at
length
the
dead
and
the
alive
in
one
dread
mass
were
parted
and
the
stain
of
blood
from
mortal
steel
fell
the
fields
like
rain
for
now
the
despot
bloodhounds
with
their
prey
unarmed
and
unaware
were
gorging
deep
their
gluttony
of
death
the
loose
array
of
horsemen
the
wide
fields
murdering
sweep
and
with
loud
laughter
for
their
tyrant
reap
a
harvest
sown
with
other
hopes
the
while
far
overhead
ships
from
propontis
keep
a
killing
rain
of
fire
when
the
waves
smile
as
sudden
earthquakes
light
many
a
thus
sudden
unexpected
feast
was
spread
for
the
of
i
saw
the
sight
i
moved
i
lived
as
the
heaps
of
dead
whose
stony
eyes
glared
in
the
morning
light
i
trod
to
me
there
came
no
thought
of
flight
but
with
loud
cries
of
scorn
which
whoso
heard
that
dreaded
death
felt
in
his
veins
the
might
of
virtuous
shame
return
the
crowd
i
stirred
and
desperation
hope
in
many
hearts
recurred
a
band
of
brothers
gathering
round
me
made
although
unarmed
a
steadfast
front
and
still
retreating
with
stern
looks
beneath
the
shade
of
gathered
eyebrows
did
the
victors
fill
with
doubt
even
in
success
deliberate
will
inspired
our
growing
troop
not
overthrown
it
gained
the
shelter
of
a
grassy
hill
and
ever
still
our
comrades
were
hewn
down
and
their
defenceless
limbs
beneath
our
footsteps
strown
immovably
we
stood
in
joy
i
found
beside
me
then
firm
as
a
giant
pine
among
the
driven
around
the
old
man
whom
i
loved
his
eyes
divine
with
a
mild
look
of
courage
answered
mine
and
my
young
friend
was
near
and
ardently
his
hand
grasped
mine
a
moment
now
the
line
of
war
extended
to
our
rallying
cry
as
myriads
flocked
in
love
and
brotherhood
to
die
for
ever
while
the
sun
was
climbing
heaven
the
horseman
hewed
our
unarmed
myriads
down
safely
though
when
by
thirst
of
carnage
driven
too
near
those
slaves
were
swiftly
overthrown
by
hundreds
leaping
on
them
flesh
and
bone
soon
made
our
ghastly
ramparts
then
the
shaft
of
the
artillery
from
the
sea
was
thrown
more
fast
and
fiery
and
the
conquerors
laughed
in
pride
to
hear
the
wind
our
screams
of
torment
waft
for
on
one
side
alone
the
hill
gave
shelter
so
vast
that
phalanx
of
unconquered
men
and
there
the
living
in
the
blood
did
welter
of
the
dead
and
dying
which
in
that
green
glen
like
stifled
torrents
made
a
plashy
fen
under
the
feet
thus
was
the
butchery
waged
while
the
sun
clomb
heaven
eastern
steep
but
when
it
to
sink
a
fiercer
combat
raged
for
in
more
doubtful
strife
the
armies
were
engaged
within
a
cave
upon
the
hill
were
found
a
bundle
of
rude
pikes
the
instrument
of
those
who
war
but
on
their
native
ground
for
natural
rights
a
shout
of
joyance
sent
even
from
our
hearts
the
wide
air
pierced
and
rent
as
those
few
arms
the
bravest
and
the
best
seized
and
each
sixth
thus
armed
did
now
present
a
line
which
covered
and
sustained
the
rest
a
confident
phalanx
which
the
foes
on
every
side
invest
that
onset
turned
the
foes
to
flight
almost
but
soon
they
saw
their
present
strength
and
knew
that
coming
night
would
to
our
resolute
host
bring
victory
so
dismounting
close
they
drew
their
glittering
files
and
then
the
combat
grew
unequal
but
most
horrible
and
ever
our
myriads
whom
the
swift
bolt
overthrew
or
the
red
sword
failed
like
a
mountain
river
which
rushes
forth
in
foam
to
sink
in
sands
for
ever
sorrow
and
shame
to
see
with
their
own
kind
our
human
brethren
mix
like
beasts
of
blood
to
mutual
ruin
armed
by
one
behind
who
sits
and
scoffs
that
friend
so
mild
and
good
who
like
its
shadow
near
my
youth
had
stood
was
stabbed
my
old
preserver
hoary
hair
with
the
flesh
clinging
to
its
roots
was
strewed
under
my
feet
i
lost
all
sense
or
care
and
like
the
rest
i
grew
desperate
and
unaware
the
battle
became
ghastlier
in
the
midst
i
paused
and
saw
how
ugly
and
how
fell
o
hate
thou
art
even
when
thy
life
thou
for
love
the
ground
in
many
a
little
dell
was
broken
up
and
down
whose
steeps
befell
alternate
victory
and
defeat
and
there
the
combatants
with
rage
most
horrible
strove
and
their
eyes
started
with
cracking
stare
and
impotent
their
tongues
they
lolled
into
the
air
flaccid
and
foamy
like
a
mad
dog
hanging
want
and
and
the
pest
swift
bane
when
its
shafts
smite
while
yet
its
bow
is
twanging
have
each
their
mark
and
sign
some
ghastly
stain
and
this
was
thine
o
war
of
hate
and
pain
thou
loathed
slave
i
saw
all
shapes
of
death
and
ministered
to
many
the
plain
while
carnage
in
the
sunbeam
warmth
did
seethe
till
twilight
the
east
wove
her
serenest
wreath
the
few
who
yet
survived
resolute
and
firm
around
me
fought
at
the
decline
of
day
winding
above
the
mountain
snowy
term
new
banners
shone
they
quivered
in
the
ray
of
the
sun
unseen
orb
ere
night
the
array
of
fresh
troops
hemmed
us
in
of
those
brave
bands
i
soon
survived
alone
and
now
i
lay
vanquished
and
faint
the
grasp
of
bloody
hands
i
felt
and
saw
on
high
the
glare
of
falling
brands
when
on
my
foes
a
sudden
terror
came
and
they
fled
scattering
lo
with
reinless
speed
a
black
tartarian
horse
of
giant
frame
comes
trampling
over
the
dead
the
living
bleed
beneath
the
hoofs
of
that
tremendous
steed
on
which
like
to
an
angel
robed
in
white
sate
one
waving
a
sword
the
hosts
recede
and
fly
as
through
their
ranks
with
awful
might
sweeps
in
the
shadow
of
eve
that
phantom
swift
and
bright
and
its
path
made
a
i
rose
and
marked
its
coming
it
relaxed
its
course
as
it
approached
me
and
the
wind
that
flows
through
night
bore
accents
to
mine
ear
whose
force
might
create
smiles
in
death
the
tartar
horse
paused
and
i
saw
the
shape
its
might
which
swayed
and
heard
her
musical
pants
like
the
sweet
source
of
waters
in
the
desert
as
she
said
with
me
laon
now
i
rapidly
obeyed
then
away
she
cried
and
stretched
her
sword
as
a
scourge
over
the
courser
head
and
lightly
shook
the
we
spake
no
word
but
like
the
vapour
of
the
tempest
fled
over
the
plain
her
dark
hair
was
dispread
like
the
pine
locks
upon
the
lingering
blast
over
mine
eyes
its
shadowy
strings
it
spread
fitfully
and
the
hills
and
streams
fled
fast
as
their
glimmering
forms
the
steed
broad
shadow
passed
and
his
hoofs
ground
the
rocks
to
fire
and
dust
his
strong
sides
made
the
torrents
rise
in
spray
and
turbulence
as
of
a
whirlwind
gust
surrounded
us
and
still
away
away
through
the
desert
night
we
sped
while
she
alway
gazed
on
a
mountain
which
we
neared
whose
crest
crowned
with
a
marble
ruin
in
the
ray
of
the
obscure
stars
gleamed
its
rugged
breast
the
steed
strained
up
and
then
his
impulse
did
arrest
a
rocky
hill
which
overhung
the
ocean
from
that
lone
ruin
when
the
steed
that
panted
paused
might
be
heard
the
murmur
of
the
motion
of
waters
as
in
spots
for
ever
haunted
by
the
choicest
winds
of
heaven
which
are
enchanted
to
music
by
the
wand
of
solitude
that
wizard
wild
and
the
far
tents
implanted
upon
the
plain
be
seen
by
those
who
stood
thence
marking
the
dark
shore
of
ocean
curved
flood
one
moment
these
were
heard
and
seen
another
passed
and
the
two
who
stood
beneath
that
night
each
only
heard
or
saw
or
felt
the
other
as
from
the
lofty
steed
she
did
alight
cythna
for
from
the
eyes
whose
deepest
light
of
love
and
sadness
made
my
lips
feel
pale
with
influence
strange
of
mournfullest
delight
my
own
sweet
cythna
looked
with
joy
did
quail
and
felt
her
strength
in
tears
of
human
weakness
fail
and
for
a
space
in
my
embrace
she
rested
her
head
on
my
unquiet
heart
reposing
while
my
faint
arms
her
languid
frame
invested
at
length
she
looked
on
me
and
half
unclosing
her
tremulous
lips
said
thy
bands
were
losing
the
battle
as
i
stood
before
the
king
in
i
burst
them
then
and
swiftly
choosing
the
time
did
seize
a
tartar
sword
and
spring
upon
his
horse
and
swift
as
on
the
whirlwind
wing
thou
and
i
been
borne
beyond
pursuer
and
we
are
here
then
turning
to
the
steed
she
pressed
the
white
moon
on
his
front
with
pure
and
lips
and
many
a
fragrant
weed
from
the
green
ruin
plucked
that
he
might
feed
but
i
to
a
stone
seat
that
maiden
led
and
kissing
her
fair
eyes
said
hast
need
of
rest
and
i
heaped
up
the
courser
bed
in
a
green
mossy
nook
with
mountain
flowers
dispread
within
that
ruin
where
a
shattered
portal
looks
to
the
eastern
stars
abandoned
now
by
man
to
be
the
home
of
things
immortal
memories
like
awful
ghosts
which
come
and
go
and
must
inherit
all
he
builds
below
when
he
is
gone
a
hall
stood
whose
roof
fair
clinging
weeds
with
ivy
pale
did
grow
clasping
its
gray
rents
with
a
verdurous
woof
a
hanging
dome
of
leaves
a
canopy
the
autumnal
winds
as
if
had
made
a
natural
couch
of
leaves
in
that
recess
which
seasons
none
disturbed
but
in
the
shade
of
flowering
parasites
did
spring
love
to
dress
with
their
sweet
blooms
the
wintry
loneliness
of
those
dead
leaves
shedding
their
stars
the
wandering
wind
her
nurslings
might
caress
whose
intertwining
fingers
ever
there
made
music
wild
and
soft
that
filled
the
listening
air
we
know
not
where
we
go
or
what
sweet
dream
may
pilot
us
through
caverns
strange
and
fair
of
far
and
pathless
passion
while
the
stream
of
life
our
bark
doth
on
its
whirlpools
bear
spreading
swift
wings
as
sails
to
the
dim
air
nor
should
we
seek
to
know
so
the
devotion
of
love
and
gentle
thoughts
be
heard
still
there
louder
and
louder
from
the
utmost
ocean
of
universal
life
attuning
its
commotion
to
the
pure
all
things
are
pure
oblivion
wrapped
our
spirits
and
the
fearful
overthrow
of
public
hope
was
from
our
being
snapped
though
linked
years
had
bound
it
there
for
now
a
power
a
thirst
a
knowledge
which
below
all
thoughts
like
light
beyond
the
atmosphere
clothing
its
clouds
with
grace
doth
ever
flow
came
on
us
as
we
sate
in
silence
there
beneath
the
golden
stars
of
the
clear
azure
air
in
silence
which
doth
follow
talk
that
causes
the
baffled
heart
to
speak
with
sighs
and
tears
when
wildering
passion
swalloweth
up
the
pauses
of
inexpressive
speech
the
youthful
years
which
we
together
passed
their
hopes
and
fears
the
blood
itself
which
ran
within
our
frames
that
likeness
of
the
features
which
endears
the
thoughts
expressed
by
them
our
very
names
and
all
the
winged
hours
which
speechless
memory
claims
had
found
a
voice
and
ere
that
voice
did
pass
the
night
grew
damp
and
dim
and
through
a
rent
of
the
ruin
where
we
sate
from
the
morass
a
wandering
meteor
by
some
wild
wind
sent
hung
high
in
the
green
dome
to
which
it
lent
a
faint
and
pallid
lustre
while
the
song
of
blasts
in
which
its
blue
hair
quivering
bent
strewed
strangest
sounds
the
moving
leaves
among
a
wondrous
light
the
sound
as
of
a
spirit
tongue
the
meteor
showed
the
leaves
on
which
we
sate
and
cythna
glowing
arms
and
the
thick
ties
of
her
soft
hair
which
bent
with
gathered
weight
my
neck
near
hers
her
dark
and
deepening
eyes
which
as
twin
phantoms
of
one
star
that
lies
a
dim
well
move
though
the
star
reposes
swam
in
our
mute
and
liquid
ecstasies
her
marble
brow
and
eager
lips
like
roses
with
their
own
fragrance
pale
which
spring
but
half
uncloses
the
meteor
to
its
far
morass
returned
the
beating
of
our
veins
one
interval
made
still
and
then
i
felt
the
blood
that
burned
within
her
frame
mingle
with
mine
and
fall
around
my
heart
like
fire
and
over
all
a
mist
was
spread
the
sickness
of
a
deep
and
speechless
swoon
of
joy
as
might
befall
two
disunited
spirits
when
they
leap
in
union
from
this
earth
obscure
and
fading
sleep
was
it
one
moment
that
confounded
thus
all
thought
all
sense
all
feeling
into
one
unutterable
power
which
shielded
us
even
from
our
own
cold
looks
when
we
had
gone
into
a
wide
and
wild
oblivion
of
tumult
and
of
tenderness
or
now
had
ages
such
as
make
the
moon
and
sun
the
seasons
and
mankind
their
changes
know
left
fear
and
time
unfelt
by
us
alone
below
i
know
not
what
are
kisses
whose
fire
clasps
the
failing
heart
in
languishment
or
limb
twined
within
limb
or
the
quick
dying
gasps
of
the
life
meeting
when
the
faint
eyes
swim
through
tears
of
a
wide
mist
boundless
and
dim
in
one
caress
what
is
the
strong
control
which
leads
the
heart
that
dizzy
steep
to
climb
where
far
over
the
world
those
vapours
roll
which
blend
two
restless
frames
in
one
reposing
soul
it
is
the
shadow
which
doth
float
unseen
but
not
unfelt
blind
mortality
whose
divine
darkness
fled
not
from
that
green
and
lone
recess
where
lapped
in
peace
did
lie
our
linked
frames
till
from
the
changing
sky
that
night
and
still
another
day
had
fled
and
then
i
saw
and
felt
the
moon
was
high
and
clouds
as
of
a
coming
storm
were
spread
under
its
orb
loud
winds
were
gathering
overhead
cythna
sweet
lips
seemed
lurid
in
the
moon
her
fairest
limbs
with
the
night
wind
were
chill
and
her
dark
tresses
were
all
loosely
strewn
her
pale
bosom
all
within
was
still
and
the
sweet
peace
of
joy
did
almost
fill
the
depth
of
her
unfathomable
look
and
we
sate
calmly
though
that
rocky
hill
the
waves
contending
in
its
caverns
strook
for
they
foreknew
the
storm
and
the
gray
ruin
shook
there
we
unheeding
sate
in
the
communion
of
interchanged
vows
which
with
a
rite
of
faith
most
sweet
and
sacred
stamped
our
few
were
the
living
hearts
which
could
unite
like
ours
or
celebrate
a
bridal
night
with
such
close
sympathies
for
they
had
sprung
from
linked
youth
and
from
the
gentle
might
of
earliest
love
delayed
and
cherished
long
which
common
hopes
and
fears
made
like
a
tempest
strong
and
such
is
nature
law
divine
that
those
who
grow
together
can
not
choose
but
love
if
faith
or
custom
do
not
interpose
or
common
slavery
mar
what
else
might
move
all
gentlest
thoughts
as
in
the
sacred
grove
which
shades
the
springs
of
ethiopian
nile
that
living
tree
which
if
the
arrowy
dove
strike
with
her
shadow
shrinks
in
fear
awhile
but
its
own
kindred
leaves
clasps
while
the
sunbeams
smile
and
clings
to
them
when
darkness
may
dissever
the
close
caresses
of
all
duller
plants
which
bloom
on
the
wide
earth
thus
we
for
ever
were
linked
for
love
had
nursed
us
in
the
haunts
where
knowledge
from
its
secret
source
enchants
young
hearts
with
the
fresh
music
of
its
springing
ere
yet
its
gathered
flood
feeds
human
wants
as
the
great
nile
feeds
egypt
ever
flinging
light
on
the
woven
boughs
which
its
waves
are
swinging
the
tones
of
cythna
voice
like
echoes
were
of
those
far
murmuring
streams
they
rose
and
fell
mixed
with
mine
own
in
the
tempestuous
air
and
so
we
sate
until
our
talk
befell
of
the
late
ruin
swift
and
horrible
and
how
those
seeds
of
hope
might
yet
be
sown
whose
fruit
is
evil
mortal
poison
well
for
us
this
ruin
made
a
lone
but
cythna
eyes
looked
faint
and
now
two
days
were
gone
since
she
had
food
therefore
i
did
awaken
the
tartar
steed
who
from
his
ebon
mane
soon
as
the
clinging
slumbers
he
had
shaken
bent
his
thin
head
to
seek
the
brazen
rein
following
me
obediently
with
pain
of
heart
so
deep
and
dread
that
one
caress
when
lips
and
heart
refuse
to
part
again
till
they
have
told
their
fill
could
scarce
express
the
anguish
of
her
mute
and
fearful
tenderness
cythna
beheld
me
part
as
i
bestrode
that
willing
steed
the
tempest
and
the
night
which
gave
my
path
its
safety
as
i
rode
down
the
ravine
of
rocks
did
soon
unite
the
darkness
and
the
tumult
of
their
might
borne
on
all
far
through
the
streaming
rain
floating
at
intervals
the
garments
white
of
cythna
gleamed
and
her
voice
once
again
came
to
me
on
the
gust
and
soon
i
reached
the
plain
i
dreaded
not
the
tempest
nor
did
he
who
bore
me
but
his
eyeballs
wide
and
red
turned
on
the
lightning
cleft
exultingly
and
when
the
earth
beneath
his
tameless
tread
shook
with
the
sullen
thunder
he
would
spread
his
nostrils
to
the
blast
and
joyously
mock
the
fierce
peal
with
neighings
thus
we
sped
the
lit
plain
and
soon
i
could
descry
where
death
and
fire
had
gorged
the
spoil
of
victory
there
was
a
desolate
village
in
a
wood
whose
leaves
now
scattering
fed
the
hungry
storm
it
was
a
place
of
blood
a
heap
of
hearthless
walls
the
flames
were
dead
within
those
dwellings
now
the
life
had
fled
from
all
those
corpses
now
but
the
wide
sky
flooded
with
lightning
was
ribbed
overhead
by
the
black
rafters
and
around
did
lie
women
and
babes
and
men
slaughtered
confusedly
beside
the
fountain
in
the
dismounting
i
beheld
those
corpses
stare
with
horny
eyes
upon
each
other
face
and
on
the
earth
and
on
the
vacant
air
and
upon
me
close
to
the
waters
where
i
stooped
to
slake
my
thirst
i
shrank
to
taste
for
the
salt
bitterness
of
blood
was
there
but
tied
the
steed
beside
and
sought
in
haste
if
any
yet
survived
amid
that
ghastly
waste
no
living
thing
was
there
beside
one
woman
whom
i
found
wandering
in
the
streets
and
she
was
withered
from
a
likeness
of
aught
human
into
a
fiend
by
some
strange
misery
soon
as
she
heard
my
steps
she
leaped
on
me
and
glued
her
burning
lips
to
mine
and
laughed
with
a
loud
long
and
frantic
laugh
of
glee
and
cried
mortal
thou
hast
deeply
quaffed
the
plague
blue
kisses
soon
millions
shall
pledge
the
draught
name
is
pestilence
this
bosom
dry
once
fed
two
babes
a
sister
and
a
brother
when
i
came
home
one
in
the
blood
did
lie
of
three
the
flames
had
ate
the
other
since
then
i
have
no
longer
been
a
mother
but
i
am
pestilence
hither
and
thither
i
flit
about
that
i
may
slay
and
smother
all
lips
which
i
have
kissed
must
surely
wither
but
death
if
thou
art
he
we
go
to
work
together
thou
here
the
moonlight
comes
in
flashes
the
dew
is
rising
dankly
from
the
dell
moisten
her
and
thou
shalt
see
the
gashes
in
my
sweet
boy
now
full
of
worms
but
tell
first
what
thou
seek
for
food
well
thou
shalt
have
food
famine
my
paramour
waits
for
us
at
the
feast
cruel
and
fell
is
famine
but
he
drives
not
from
his
door
those
whom
these
lips
have
kissed
alone
no
more
no
more
as
thus
she
spake
she
grasped
me
with
the
strength
of
madness
and
by
many
a
ruined
hearth
she
led
and
over
many
a
corpse
at
length
we
came
to
a
lone
hut
where
on
the
earth
which
made
its
floor
she
in
her
ghastly
mirth
gathering
from
all
those
homes
now
desolate
had
piled
three
heaps
of
loaves
making
a
dearth
among
the
dead
round
which
she
set
in
state
a
ring
of
cold
stiff
babes
silent
and
stark
they
sate
she
leaped
upon
a
pile
and
lifted
high
her
mad
looks
to
the
lightning
and
cried
share
the
great
feast
we
must
die
and
then
she
spurned
the
loaves
with
her
pale
feet
towards
her
bloodless
guests
that
sight
to
meet
mine
eyes
and
my
heart
ached
and
but
that
she
who
loved
me
did
with
absent
looks
defeat
despair
i
might
have
raved
in
sympathy
but
now
i
took
the
food
that
woman
offered
me
and
vainly
having
with
her
madness
striven
if
i
might
win
her
to
return
with
me
departed
in
the
eastern
beams
of
heaven
the
lightning
now
grew
pallid
rapidly
as
by
the
shore
of
the
tempestuous
sea
the
dark
steed
bore
me
and
the
mountain
gray
soon
echoed
to
his
hoofs
and
i
could
see
cythna
among
the
rocks
where
she
alway
had
sate
with
anxious
eyes
fixed
on
the
lingering
day
and
joy
was
ours
to
meet
she
was
most
pale
famished
and
wet
and
weary
so
i
cast
my
arms
around
her
lest
her
steps
should
fail
as
to
our
home
we
went
and
thus
embraced
her
full
heart
seemed
a
deeper
joy
to
taste
than
the
prosperous
know
the
steed
behind
trod
peacefully
along
the
mountain
waste
we
reached
our
home
ere
morning
could
unbind
night
latest
veil
and
on
our
reclined
her
chilled
heart
having
cherished
in
my
bosom
and
sweetest
kisses
past
we
two
did
share
our
peaceful
meal
as
an
autumnal
blossom
which
spreads
its
shrunk
leaves
in
the
sunny
air
after
cold
showers
like
rainbows
woven
there
thus
in
her
lips
and
cheeks
the
vital
spirit
mantled
and
in
her
eyes
an
atmosphere
of
health
and
hope
and
sorrow
languished
near
it
and
fear
and
all
that
dark
despondence
doth
inherit
notes
bradley
who
cps
marianne
dream
see
note
at
end
canto
so
we
sate
joyous
as
the
morning
ray
which
fed
upon
the
wrecks
of
night
and
storm
now
lingering
on
the
winds
light
airs
did
play
among
the
dewy
weeds
the
sun
was
warm
and
we
sate
linked
in
the
inwoven
charm
of
converse
and
caresses
sweet
and
deep
speechless
caresses
talk
that
might
disarm
time
though
he
wield
the
darts
of
death
and
sleep
and
those
thrice
mortal
barbs
in
his
own
poison
steep
i
told
her
of
my
sufferings
and
my
madness
and
how
awakened
from
that
dreamy
mood
by
liberty
uprise
the
strength
of
gladness
came
to
my
spirit
in
my
solitude
and
all
that
now
i
was
while
tears
pursued
each
other
down
her
fair
and
listening
cheek
fast
as
the
thoughts
which
fed
them
like
a
flood
from
sunbright
dales
and
when
i
ceased
to
speak
her
accents
soft
and
sweet
the
pausing
air
did
wake
she
told
me
a
strange
tale
of
strange
endurance
like
broken
memories
of
many
a
heart
woven
into
one
to
which
no
firm
assurance
so
wild
were
they
could
her
own
faith
impart
she
said
that
not
a
tear
did
dare
to
start
from
the
swoln
brain
and
that
her
thoughts
were
firm
when
from
all
mortal
hope
she
did
depart
borne
by
those
slaves
across
the
ocean
term
and
that
she
reached
the
port
without
one
fear
infirm
one
was
she
among
many
there
the
thralls
of
the
cold
tyrant
cruel
lust
and
they
laughed
mournfully
in
those
polluted
halls
but
she
was
calm
and
sad
musing
alway
on
loftiest
enterprise
till
on
a
day
the
tyrant
heard
her
singing
to
her
lute
a
wild
and
sad
and
lay
like
winds
that
die
in
wastes
one
moment
mute
the
evil
thoughts
it
made
which
did
his
breast
pollute
even
when
he
saw
her
wondrous
loveliness
one
moment
to
great
nature
sacred
power
he
bent
and
was
no
longer
passionless
but
when
he
bade
her
to
his
secret
bower
be
borne
a
loveless
victim
and
she
tore
her
locks
in
agony
and
her
words
of
flame
and
mightier
looks
availed
not
then
he
bore
again
his
load
of
slavery
and
became
a
king
a
heartless
beast
a
pageant
and
a
name
she
told
me
what
a
loathsome
agony
is
that
when
selfishness
mocks
love
delight
foul
as
in
dream
most
fearful
imagery
to
dally
with
the
mowing
dead
that
night
all
torture
fear
or
horror
made
seem
light
which
the
soul
dreams
or
knows
and
when
the
day
shone
on
her
awful
frenzy
from
the
sight
where
like
a
spirit
in
fleshly
chains
she
lay
struggling
aghast
and
pale
the
tyrant
fled
away
her
madness
was
a
beam
of
light
a
power
which
dawned
through
the
rent
soul
and
words
it
gave
gestures
and
looks
such
as
in
whirlwinds
bore
which
might
not
be
withstood
whence
none
could
save
all
who
approached
their
sphere
like
some
calm
wave
vexed
into
whirlpools
by
the
chasms
beneath
and
sympathy
made
each
attendant
slave
fearless
and
free
and
they
began
to
breathe
deep
curses
like
the
voice
of
flames
far
underneath
the
king
felt
pale
upon
his
noonday
throne
at
night
two
slaves
he
to
her
chamber
sent
one
was
a
green
and
wrinkled
eunuch
grown
from
human
shape
into
an
instrument
of
all
things
ill
distorted
bowed
and
bent
the
other
was
a
wretch
from
infancy
made
dumb
by
poison
who
nought
knew
or
meant
but
to
obey
from
the
fire
isles
came
he
a
diver
lean
and
strong
of
oman
coral
sea
they
bore
her
to
a
bark
and
the
swift
stroke
of
silent
rowers
clove
the
blue
moonlight
seas
until
upon
their
path
the
morning
broke
they
anchored
then
where
be
there
calm
or
breeze
the
gloomiest
of
the
drear
symplegades
shakes
with
the
sleepless
surge
the
ethiop
there
wound
his
long
arms
around
her
and
with
knees
like
iron
clasped
her
feet
and
plunged
with
her
among
the
closing
waves
out
of
the
boundless
air
as
an
eagle
stooping
from
the
plain
of
morning
light
into
some
shadowy
wood
he
plunged
through
the
green
silence
of
the
main
through
many
a
cavern
which
the
eternal
flood
had
scooped
as
dark
lairs
for
its
monster
brood
and
among
mighty
shapes
which
fled
in
wonder
and
among
mightier
shadows
which
pursued
his
heels
he
wound
until
the
dark
rocks
under
he
touched
a
golden
chain
a
sound
arose
like
thunder
stunning
clang
of
massive
bolts
redoubling
beneath
the
deep
a
burst
of
waters
driven
as
from
the
roots
of
the
sea
raging
and
bubbling
and
in
that
roof
of
crags
a
space
was
riven
through
which
there
shone
the
emerald
beams
of
heaven
shot
through
the
lines
of
many
waves
inwoven
like
sunlight
through
acacia
woods
at
even
through
which
his
way
the
diver
having
cloven
passed
like
a
spark
sent
up
out
of
a
burning
oven
then
she
said
laid
me
in
a
cave
above
the
waters
by
that
chasm
of
sea
a
fountain
round
and
vast
in
which
the
wave
imprisoned
boiled
and
leaped
perpetually
down
which
one
moment
resting
he
did
flee
winning
the
adverse
depth
that
spacious
cell
like
an
hupaithric
temple
wide
and
high
whose
aery
dome
is
inaccessible
was
pierced
with
one
round
cleft
through
which
the
sunbeams
fell
the
fountain
brink
was
richly
paven
with
the
deep
wealth
coral
and
pearl
and
sand
like
spangling
gold
and
purple
shells
engraven
with
mystic
legends
by
no
mortal
hand
left
there
when
thronging
to
the
moon
command
the
gathering
waves
rent
the
hesperian
gate
of
mountains
and
on
such
bright
floor
did
stand
columns
and
shapes
like
statues
and
the
state
of
kingless
thrones
which
earth
did
in
her
heart
create
fiend
of
madness
which
had
made
its
prey
of
my
poor
heart
was
lulled
to
sleep
awhile
there
was
an
interval
of
many
a
day
and
a
brought
me
food
the
while
whose
nest
was
built
in
that
untrodden
isle
and
who
to
be
the
gaoler
had
been
taught
of
that
strange
dungeon
as
a
friend
whose
smile
like
light
and
rest
at
morn
and
even
is
sought
that
wild
bird
was
to
me
till
madness
misery
brought
misery
of
a
madness
slow
and
creeping
which
made
the
earth
seem
fire
the
sea
seem
air
and
the
white
clouds
of
noon
which
oft
were
sleeping
in
the
blue
heaven
so
beautiful
and
fair
like
hosts
of
ghastly
shadows
hovering
there
and
the
looked
a
fiend
who
bore
thy
mangled
limbs
for
food
thus
all
things
were
transformed
into
the
agony
which
i
wore
even
as
a
poisoned
robe
around
my
bosom
core
i
knew
the
day
and
night
fast
fleeing
the
eagle
and
the
fountain
and
the
air
another
frenzy
came
there
seemed
a
being
within
me
a
strange
load
my
heart
did
bear
as
if
some
living
thing
had
made
its
lair
even
in
the
fountains
of
my
life
a
long
and
wondrous
vision
wrought
from
my
despair
then
grew
like
sweet
reality
among
dim
visionary
woes
an
unreposing
throng
i
was
about
to
be
a
mother
month
after
month
went
by
and
still
i
dreamed
that
we
should
soon
be
all
to
one
another
i
and
my
child
and
still
new
pulses
seemed
to
beat
beside
my
heart
and
still
i
deemed
there
was
a
babe
within
and
when
the
rain
of
winter
through
the
rifted
cavern
streamed
methought
after
a
lapse
of
lingering
pain
i
saw
that
lovely
shape
which
near
my
heart
had
lain
was
a
babe
beautiful
from
its
birth
it
was
like
thee
dear
love
its
eyes
were
thine
its
brow
its
lips
and
so
upon
the
earth
it
laid
its
fingers
as
now
rest
on
mine
thine
own
beloved
was
a
dream
divine
even
to
remember
how
it
fled
how
swift
how
utterly
might
make
the
heart
repine
though
was
a
dream
then
cythna
did
uplift
her
looks
on
mine
as
if
some
doubt
she
sought
to
shift
a
doubt
which
would
not
flee
a
tenderness
of
questioning
grief
a
source
of
thronging
tears
which
having
passed
as
one
whom
sobs
oppress
she
spoke
in
the
wilderness
of
years
her
memory
aye
like
a
green
home
appears
she
sucked
her
fill
even
at
this
breast
sweet
love
for
many
months
i
had
no
mortal
fears
methought
i
felt
her
lips
and
breath
approve
it
was
a
human
thing
which
to
my
bosom
clove
watched
the
dawn
of
her
first
smiles
and
soon
when
zenith
stars
were
trembling
on
the
wave
or
when
the
beams
of
the
invisible
moon
or
sun
from
many
a
prism
within
the
cave
their
shadows
to
the
water
gave
her
looks
would
hunt
them
and
with
outspread
hand
from
the
swift
lights
which
might
that
fountain
pave
she
would
mark
one
and
laugh
when
that
command
slighting
it
lingered
there
and
could
not
understand
her
looks
began
to
talk
with
me
and
no
articulate
sounds
but
something
sweet
her
lips
would
frame
so
sweet
it
could
not
be
that
it
was
meaningless
her
touch
would
meet
mine
and
our
pulses
calmly
flow
and
beat
in
response
while
we
slept
and
on
a
day
when
i
was
happiest
in
that
strange
retreat
with
heaps
of
golden
shells
we
two
did
play
both
infants
weaving
wings
for
time
perpetual
way
night
methought
her
waning
eyes
were
grown
weary
with
joy
and
tired
with
our
delight
we
on
the
earth
like
sister
twins
lay
down
on
one
fair
mother
bosom
from
that
night
she
fled
like
those
illusions
clear
and
bright
which
dwell
in
lakes
when
the
red
moon
on
high
pause
ere
it
wakens
tempest
and
her
flight
though
was
the
death
of
brainless
fantasy
yet
smote
my
lonesome
heart
more
than
all
misery
seemed
that
in
the
dreary
night
the
diver
who
brought
me
thither
came
again
and
bore
my
child
away
i
saw
the
waters
quiver
when
he
so
swiftly
sunk
as
once
before
then
morning
came
it
shone
even
as
of
yore
but
i
was
changed
the
very
life
was
gone
out
of
my
heart
i
wasted
more
and
more
day
after
day
and
sitting
there
alone
vexed
the
inconstant
waves
with
my
perpetual
moan
was
no
longer
mad
and
yet
methought
my
breasts
were
swoln
and
changed
in
every
vein
the
blood
stood
still
one
moment
while
that
thought
was
passing
with
a
gush
of
sickening
pain
it
ebbed
even
to
its
withered
springs
again
when
my
wan
eyes
in
stern
resolve
i
turned
from
that
most
strange
delusion
which
would
fain
have
waked
the
dream
for
which
my
spirit
yearned
with
more
than
human
love
then
left
it
unreturned
now
my
reason
was
restored
to
me
i
struggled
with
that
dream
which
like
a
beast
most
fierce
and
beauteous
in
my
memory
had
made
its
lair
and
on
my
heart
did
feast
but
all
that
cave
and
all
its
shapes
possessed
by
thoughts
which
could
not
fade
renewed
each
one
some
smile
some
look
some
gesture
which
had
blessed
me
heretofore
i
sitting
there
alone
vexed
the
inconstant
waves
with
my
perpetual
moan
passed
i
know
not
whether
months
or
years
for
day
nor
night
nor
change
of
seasons
made
its
note
but
thoughts
and
unavailing
tears
and
i
became
at
last
even
as
a
shade
a
smoke
a
cloud
on
which
the
winds
have
preyed
till
it
be
thin
as
air
until
one
even
a
nautilus
upon
the
fountain
played
spreading
his
azure
sail
where
breath
of
heaven
descended
not
among
the
waves
and
whirlpools
driven
when
the
eagle
came
that
lovely
thing
oaring
with
rosy
feet
its
silver
boat
fled
near
me
as
for
shelter
on
slow
wing
the
eagle
hovering
his
prey
did
float
but
when
he
saw
that
i
with
fear
did
note
his
purpose
proffering
my
own
food
to
him
the
eager
plumes
subsided
on
his
throat
he
came
where
that
bright
child
of
sea
did
swim
and
it
cast
in
peace
his
shadow
broad
and
dim
wakened
me
it
gave
me
human
strength
and
hope
i
know
not
whence
or
wherefore
rose
but
i
resumed
my
ancient
powers
at
length
my
spirit
felt
again
like
one
of
those
like
thine
whose
fate
it
is
to
make
the
woes
of
humankind
their
prey
what
was
this
cave
its
deep
foundation
no
firm
purpose
knows
immutable
resistless
strong
to
save
like
mind
while
yet
it
mocks
the
grave
where
was
laon
might
my
heart
be
dead
while
that
far
dearer
heart
could
move
and
be
or
whilst
over
the
earth
the
pall
was
spread
which
i
had
sworn
to
rend
i
might
be
free
could
i
but
win
that
friendly
bird
to
me
to
bring
me
ropes
and
long
in
vain
i
sought
by
intercourse
of
mutual
imagery
of
objects
if
such
aid
he
could
be
taught
but
fruit
and
flowers
and
boughs
yet
never
ropes
he
brought
live
in
our
own
world
and
mine
was
made
from
glorious
fantasies
of
hope
departed
aye
we
are
darkened
with
their
floating
shade
or
cast
a
lustre
on
them
time
imparted
such
power
to
me
i
became
my
eye
and
voice
grew
firm
calm
was
my
mind
and
piercing
like
the
morn
now
it
has
darted
its
lustre
on
all
hidden
things
behind
yon
dim
and
fading
clouds
which
load
the
weary
wind
mind
became
the
book
through
which
i
grew
wise
in
all
human
wisdom
and
its
cave
which
like
a
mine
i
rifled
through
and
through
to
me
the
keeping
of
its
secrets
gave
one
mind
the
type
of
all
the
moveless
wave
whose
calm
reflects
all
moving
things
that
are
necessity
and
love
and
life
the
grave
and
sympathy
fountains
of
hope
and
fear
justice
and
truth
and
time
and
the
world
natural
sphere
on
the
sand
would
i
make
signs
to
range
these
woofs
as
they
were
woven
of
my
thought
clear
elemental
shapes
whose
smallest
change
a
subtler
language
within
language
wrought
the
key
of
truths
which
once
were
dimly
taught
in
old
crotona
and
sweet
melodies
of
love
in
that
lorn
solitude
i
caught
from
mine
own
voice
in
dream
when
thy
dear
eyes
shone
through
my
sleep
and
did
that
utterance
harmonize
songs
were
winds
whereon
i
fled
at
will
as
in
a
winged
chariot
the
plain
of
crystal
youth
and
thou
wert
there
to
fill
my
heart
with
joy
and
there
we
sate
again
on
the
gray
margin
of
the
glimmering
main
happy
as
then
but
wiser
far
for
we
smiled
on
the
flowery
grave
in
which
were
lain
fear
faith
and
slavery
and
mankind
was
free
equal
and
pure
and
wise
in
wisdom
prophecy
to
my
will
my
fancies
were
as
slaves
to
do
their
sweet
and
subtile
ministries
and
oft
from
that
bright
fountain
shadowy
waves
they
would
make
human
throngs
gather
and
rise
to
combat
with
my
overflowing
eyes
and
voice
made
deep
with
passion
thus
i
grew
familiar
with
the
shock
and
the
surprise
and
war
of
earthly
minds
from
which
i
drew
the
power
which
has
been
mine
to
frame
their
thoughts
anew
thus
my
prison
was
the
populous
earth
where
i
saw
even
as
misery
dreams
of
morn
before
the
east
has
given
its
glory
birth
religion
pomp
made
desolate
by
the
scorn
of
wisdom
faintest
smile
and
thrones
uptorn
and
dwellings
of
mild
people
interspersed
with
undivided
fields
of
ripening
corn
and
love
made
free
a
hope
which
we
have
nursed
even
with
our
blood
and
tears
until
its
glory
burst
is
not
lost
there
is
some
recompense
for
hope
whose
fountain
can
be
thus
profound
even
throned
evil
splendid
impotence
girt
by
its
hell
of
power
the
secret
sound
of
hymns
to
truth
and
freedom
the
dread
bound
of
life
and
death
passed
fearlessly
and
well
dungeons
wherein
the
high
resolve
is
found
racks
which
degraded
woman
greatness
tell
and
what
may
else
be
good
and
irresistible
are
the
thoughts
which
like
the
fires
that
flare
in
isles
we
cherish
yet
in
this
dark
ruin
such
were
mine
even
there
as
in
its
sleep
some
odorous
violet
while
yet
its
leaves
with
nightly
dews
are
wet
breathes
in
prophetic
dreams
of
day
uprise
or
as
ere
scythian
frost
in
fear
has
met
spring
messengers
descending
from
the
skies
the
buds
foreknow
their
life
this
hope
must
ever
rise
years
had
passed
when
sudden
earthquake
rent
the
depth
of
ocean
and
the
cavern
cracked
with
sound
as
if
the
world
wide
continent
had
fallen
in
universal
ruin
wracked
and
through
the
cleft
streamed
in
one
cataract
the
stifling
waters
when
i
woke
the
flood
whose
banded
waves
that
crystal
cave
had
sacked
was
ebbing
round
me
and
my
bright
abode
before
me
yawned
a
chasm
desert
and
bare
and
broad
me
was
the
sky
beneath
the
sea
i
stood
upon
a
point
of
shattered
stone
and
heard
loose
rocks
rushing
tumultuously
with
splash
and
shock
into
the
deep
anon
all
ceased
and
there
was
silence
wide
and
lone
i
felt
that
i
was
free
the
quivered
beneath
my
feet
the
broad
heaven
shone
around
and
in
my
hair
the
winds
did
play
lingering
as
they
pursued
their
unimpeded
way
spirit
moved
upon
the
sea
like
wind
which
round
some
thymy
cape
will
lag
and
hover
though
it
can
wake
the
still
cloud
and
unbind
the
strength
of
tempest
day
was
almost
over
when
through
the
fading
light
i
could
discover
a
ship
approaching
its
white
sails
were
fed
with
the
north
wind
its
moving
shade
did
cover
the
twilight
deep
the
mariners
in
dread
cast
anchor
when
they
saw
new
rocks
around
them
spread
when
they
saw
one
sitting
on
a
crag
they
sent
a
boat
to
me
the
sailors
rowed
in
awe
through
many
a
new
and
fearful
jag
of
overhanging
rock
through
which
there
flowed
the
foam
of
streams
that
can
not
make
abode
they
came
and
questioned
me
but
when
they
heard
my
voice
they
became
silent
and
they
stood
and
moved
as
men
in
whom
new
love
had
stirred
deep
thoughts
so
to
the
ship
we
passed
without
a

sate
beside
the
steersman
then
and
gazing
upon
the
west
cried
spread
the

behold
the
sinking
moon
is
like
a
blazing
over
the
mountains
yet
the
city
of

yon
cape
alone
does
from
the
sight
withhold
the
stream

the
north
breathes
steadily
beneath

tremble
with
the
cold
ye
can
not

upon
the
dreary
sea
haste
haste

the
warm

mariners
obeyed
the
captain
stood
aloof
and
whispering
to
the
pilot
said
alas
alas
i
fear
we
are
pursued
by
wicked
ghosts
a
phantom
of
the
dead
the
night
before
we
sailed
came
to
my
bed
in
dream
like
that
the
pilot
then
replied
it
can
not
be
she
is
a
human
maid
her
low
voice
makes
you
weep
she
is
some
bride
or
daughter
of

can

nought
beside
passed
the
islets
borne
by

and
as
we
sailed
the
mariners
came
near
and
thronged
around
to
listen
in
the
gleam
of
the
pale
moon
i
stood
as
one
whom
fear
may
not
attaint
and
my
calm
voice
did
rear
ye
are
all
human
yon
broad
moon
gives
light
to
millions
who
the
selfsame
likeness
wear
even
while
i
speak
beneath
this
very
night
their
thoughts
flow
on
like
ours
in
sadness

what
dream
ye
your

have
built
an
home
even
for
yourselves

shore

ye
some

thus
builds
for
man

the

saw

worshipped
was
his
own
his
likeness

the
world
vast
mirror
shown
and
an
innocent
dream

that
a
faith
nursed
by
fear
dew
of

grows
thereon
and
that
men
say
that
power
has
chosen
death
on
all
who
scorn

wreak
immortal
wrath
men
say

all
that

that
the
stings
of
death

make
the
wise
his
vengeance
feel
though
truth
and
virtue
arm
their
hearts
with
tenfold
steel
and
it
is
said
this
power
will
punish
wrong
yes
add
despair
to
crime
and
pain
to
pain
and
deepest
hell

deathless
snakes

all

its

folly
the
pattern
whence
all
fraud
and
wrong
is
made
a
law
to
which
mankind
has
been
betrayed
and
human
love
is
as
the
name
well
known
of
a
dear
mother
whom
the
murderer
laid
in
bloody
grave

into
darkness
thrown
gathered
her
wildered
babes
around
him

o

to

weary
waves
justice

or
joy
those
only

labyrinth

guide
us
as
one
clear
star
the
seaman
saves
to
give
to
all
an
equal

to
track
the
steps
of
freedom
though
through
graves
she
pass
to
suffer
all
in
patient
mood
to
weep
for
crime
though
stained
with
thy
friend
dearest
blood
to
feel
the
peace
of
lot
to
own
all
sympathies
and
outrage
none
and
in
the
inmost
bowers
of
sense
and
thought
until
life
sunny
day
is
quite
gone
down
to
sit
and
smile
with
joy
or
not
alone
to
kiss
salt
tears
from
the
worn
cheek
of
woe
to
live
as
if
to
love
and
live
were
one
this
is
not
faith
or
law
nor
those
who
bow
to
thrones
on
heaven
or
earth
such
destiny
may
know
but
children
near
their
parents
tremble
now
because
they
must
obey
one
rules
another
and
as
one
power
rules
both
high
and
low
so
man
is
made
the
captive
of
his
brother
and
hate
is
throned
on
high
with
fear
her
mother
above
the
highest
and
those
whence
love
yet
flowed
when
faith
had
choked
all
other
are
darkened
woman
as
the
dwells
of
man
a
slave
and
life
is
poisoned

the

is
this
which

ye

thus

perpetual

look
on
your

it
is
the
book
of
fate
ah
it
is
dark
with
many
a
blazoned
name
of
misery
all
are
mirrors
of
the
same
but
the
dark
fiend
who
with
his
iron
pen
dipped
in
scorn
fiery
poison
makes
his
fame
enduring
there
would
the
heads
of
men
pass
harmless
if
they
scorned
to
make
their
hearts
his
den
yes
it
is
hate
that
shapeless
fiendly
thing
of
many
names
all
evil
some
divine
whom
arms
with
a
mortal
sting
which
when
the
heart
its
snaky
folds
entwine
is
wasted
quite
and
when
it
doth
repine
to
gorge
such
bitter
prey
on
all
beside
it
turns
with
ninefold
rage
as
with
its
twine
when
amphisbaena
some
fair
bird
has
tied
soon
the
putrid
mass
he
threats
on
every
side
reproach
not
thine
own
soul
but
know
thyself
nor
hate
another
crime
nor
loathe
thine
own
it
is
the
dark
idolatry
of
self
which
when
our
thoughts
and
actions
once
are
gone
demands
that
man
should
weep
and
bleed
and
groan
oh
vacant
expiation
be
at
the
past
is
death
the
future
is
thine
own
and
love
and
joy
can
make
the
foulest
breast
a
paradise
of
flowers
where
peace
might
build
her
nest
speak
thou
whence
come
ye
a
youth
made
reply
wearily
wearily
the
boundless
deep
we
sail
thou
readest
well
the
misery
told
in
these
faded
eyes
but
much
doth
sleep
within
which
there
the
poor
heart
loves
to
keep
or
dare
not
write
on
the
dishonoured
brow
even
from
our
childhood
have
we
learned
to
steep
the
bread
of
slavery
in
the
tears
of
woe
and
never
dreamed
of
hope
or
refuge
until
now
yes
i
must
speak
my
secret
should
have
perished
even
with
the
heart
it
wasted
as
a
brand
fades
in
the
dying
flame
whose
life
it
cherished
but
that
no
human
bosom
can
withstand
thee
wondrous
lady
and
the
mild
command
of
thy
keen
eyes
yes
we
are
wretched
slaves
who
from
their
wonted
loves
and
native
land
are
reft
and
bear
the
dividing
waves
the
unregarded
prey
of
calm
and
happy
graves
we
drag
afar
from
pastoral
vales
the
fairest
among
the
daughters
of
those
mountains
lone
we
drag
them
there
where
all
things
best
and
rarest
are
stained
and
trampled
years
have
come
and
gone
since
like
the
ship
which
bears
me
i
have
known
no
thought
but
now
the
eyes
of
one
dear
maid
on
mine
with
light
of
mutual
love
have
shone
she
is
my
life
i
am
but
as
the
shade
of
her
a
smoke
sent
up
from
ashes
soon
to
fade
for
she
must
perish
in
the
tyrant
hall
alas
alas
he
ceased
and
by
the
sail
sate
cowering
but
his
sobs
were
heard
by
all
and
still
before
the
ocean
and
the
gale
the
ship
fled
fast
till
the
stars
to
fail
and
round
me
gathered
with
mute
countenance
the
seamen
gazed
the
pilot
worn
and
pale
with
toil
the
captain
with
gray
locks
whose
glance
met
mine
in
restless
awe
they
stood
as
in
a
trance
recede
not
pause
not
now
thou
art
grown
old
but
hope
will
make
thee
young
for
hope
and
youth
are
children
of
one
mother
even
love
behold
the
eternal
stars
gaze
on
us
is
the
truth
within
your
soul
care
for
your
own
or
ruth
for
others
sufferings
do
ye
thirst
to
bear
a
heart
which
not
the
serpent
custom
tooth
may
violate
be
free
and
even
here
swear
to
be
firm
till
death
they
cried
we
swear
we
swear
very
darkness
shook
as
with
a
blast
of
subterranean
thunder
at
the
cry
the
hollow
shore
its
thousand
echoes
cast
into
the
night
as
if
the
sea
and
sky
and
earth
rejoiced
with
liberty
for
in
that
name
they
swore
bolts
were
undrawn
and
on
the
deck
with
unaccustomed
eye
the
captives
gazing
stood
and
every
one
shrank
as
the
inconstant
torch
upon
her
countenance
shone
were
earth
purest
children
young
and
fair
with
eyes
the
shrines
of
unawakened
thought
and
brows
as
bright
as
spring
or
morning
ere
dark
time
had
there
its
evil
legend
wrought
in
characters
of
cloud
which
wither
the
change
was
like
a
dream
to
them
but
soon
they
knew
the
glory
of
their
altered
lot
in
the
bright
wisdom
of
youth
breathless
noon
sweet
talk
and
smiles
and
sighs
all
bosoms
did
attune
one
was
mute
her
cheeks
and
lips
most
fair
changing
their
hue
like
lilies
newly
blown
beneath
a
bright
acacia
shadowy
hair
waved
by
the
wind
amid
the
sunny
noon
showed
that
her
soul
was
quivering
and
full
soon
that
youth
arose
and
breathlessly
did
look
on
her
and
me
as
for
some
speechless
boon
i
smiled
and
both
their
hands
in
mine
i
took
and
felt
a
soft
delight
from
what
their
spirits
shook
canto
night
we
anchored
in
a
woody
bay
and
sleep
no
more
around
us
dared
to
hover
than
when
all
doubt
and
fear
has
passed
away
it
shades
the
couch
of
some
unresting
lover
whose
heart
is
now
at
rest
thus
night
passed
over
in
mutual
joy
around
a
forest
grew
of
poplars
and
dark
oaks
whose
shade
did
cover
the
waning
stars
pranked
in
the
waters
blue
and
trembled
in
the
wind
which
from
the
morning
flew
joyous
mariners
and
each
free
maiden
now
brought
from
the
deep
forest
many
a
bough
with
woodland
spoil
most
innocently
laden
soon
wreaths
of
budding
foliage
seemed
to
flow
over
the
mast
and
sails
the
stern
and
prow
were
canopied
with
blooming
boughs
the
while
on
the
slant
sun
path
the
waves
we
go
rejoicing
like
the
dwellers
of
an
isle
doomed
to
pursue
those
waves
that
can
not
cease
to
smile
many
ships
spotting
the
dark
blue
deep
with
snowy
sails
fled
fast
as
ours
came
nigh
in
fear
and
wonder
and
on
every
steep
thousands
did
gaze
they
heard
the
startling
cry
like
earth
own
voice
lifted
unconquerably
to
all
her
children
the
unbounded
mirth
the
glorious
joy
of
thy
name
liberty
they
heard
as
the
mountains
of
the
earth
from
peak
to
peak
leap
on
the
beams
of
morning
birth
from
that
cry
over
the
boundless
hills
sudden
was
caught
one
universal
sound
like
a
volcano
voice
whose
thunder
fills
remotest
skies
such
glorious
madness
found
a
path
through
human
hearts
with
stream
which
drowned
its
struggling
fears
and
cares
dark
custom
brood
they
knew
not
whence
it
came
but
felt
around
a
wide
contagion
poured
they
called
aloud
on
liberty
that
name
lived
on
the
sunny
flood
reached
the
alas
from
many
spirits
the
wisdom
which
had
waked
that
cry
was
fled
like
the
brief
glory
which
dark
heaven
inherits
from
the
false
dawn
which
fades
ere
it
is
spread
upon
the
night
devouring
darkness
shed
yet
soon
bright
day
will
burst
even
like
a
chasm
of
fire
to
burn
the
shrouds
outworn
and
dead
which
wrap
the
world
a
wide
enthusiasm
to
cleanse
the
fevered
world
as
with
an
earthquake
spasm
walked
through
the
great
city
then
but
free
from
shame
or
fear
those
mariners
and
happy
maidens
did
encompass
me
and
like
a
subterranean
wind
that
stirs
some
forest
among
caves
the
hopes
and
fears
from
every
human
soul
a
murmur
strange
made
as
i
passed
and
many
wept
with
tears
of
joy
and
awe
and
winged
thoughts
did
range
and
words
which
prophesied
of
change
with
strong
speech
i
tore
the
veil
that
hid
nature
and
truth
and
liberty
and
love
as
one
who
from
some
mountain
pyramid
points
to
the
unrisen
sun
the
shades
approve
his
truth
and
flee
from
every
stream
and
grove
thus
gentle
thoughts
did
many
a
bosom
fill
wisdom
the
mail
of
tried
affections
wove
for
many
a
heart
and
tameless
scorn
of
ill
thrice
steeped
in
molten
steel
the
unconquerable
will
said
i
was
a
maniac
wild
and
lost
some
that
i
scarce
had
risen
from
the
grave
the
prophet
virgin
bride
a
heavenly
ghost
some
said
i
was
a
fiend
from
my
weird
cave
who
had
stolen
human
shape
and
the
wave
the
forest
and
the
mountain
came
some
said
i
was
the
child
of
god
sent
down
to
save
woman
from
bonds
and
death
and
on
my
head
the
burden
of
their
sins
would
frightfully
be
laid
soon
my
human
words
found
sympathy
in
human
hearts
the
purest
and
the
best
as
friend
with
friend
made
common
cause
with
me
and
they
were
few
but
resolute
the
rest
ere
yet
success
the
enterprise
had
blessed
leagued
with
me
in
their
hearts
their
meals
their
slumber
their
hourly
occupations
were
possessed
by
hopes
which
i
had
armed
to
overnumber
those
hosts
of
meaner
cares
which
life
strong
wings
encumber
chiefly
women
whom
my
voice
did
waken
from
their
cold
careless
willing
slavery
sought
me
one
truth
their
dreary
prison
has
shaken
they
looked
around
and
lo
they
became
free
their
many
tyrants
sitting
desolately
in
halls
could
none
restrain
for
wrath
red
fire
had
withered
in
the
eye
whose
lightning
once
was
death
nor
fear
nor
gain
could
tempt
one
captive
now
to
lock
another
chain
who
were
sent
to
bind
me
wept
and
felt
their
minds
outsoar
the
bonds
which
clasped
them
round
even
as
a
waxen
shape
may
waste
and
melt
in
the
white
furnace
and
a
visioned
swound
a
pause
of
hope
and
awe
the
city
bound
which
like
the
silence
of
a
tempest
birth
when
in
its
awful
shadow
it
has
wound
the
sun
the
wind
the
ocean
and
the
earth
hung
terrible
ere
yet
the
lightnings
have
leaped
forth
clouds
inwoven
in
the
silent
sky
by
winds
from
distant
regions
meeting
there
in
the
high
name
of
truth
and
liberty
around
the
city
millions
gathered
were
by
hopes
which
sprang
from
many
a
hidden
lair
words
which
the
lore
of
truth
in
hues
of
flame
arrayed
thine
own
wild
songs
which
in
the
air
like
homeless
odours
floated
and
the
name
of
thee
and
many
a
tongue
which
thou
hadst
dipped
in
flame
tyrant
knew
his
power
was
gone
but
fear
the
nurse
of
vengeance
bade
him
wait
the
event
that
perfidy
and
custom
gold
and
prayer
and
when
force
is
impotent
to
fraud
the
sceptre
of
the
world
has
lent
might
as
he
judged
confirm
his
failing
sway
therefore
throughout
the
streets
the
priests
he
sent
to
curse
the
to
their
gods
did
they
for
earthquake
plague
and
want
kneel
in
the
public
way
grave
and
hoary
men
were
bribed
to
tell
from
seats
where
law
is
made
the
slave
of
wrong
how
glorious
athens
in
her
splendour
fell
because
her
sons
were
free
and
that
among
mankind
the
many
to
the
few
belong
by
heaven
and
nature
and
necessity
they
said
that
age
was
truth
and
that
the
young
marred
with
wild
hopes
the
peace
of
slavery
with
which
old
times
and
men
had
quelled
the
vain
and
free
with
the
falsehood
of
their
poisonous
lips
they
breathed
on
the
enduring
memory
of
sages
and
of
bards
a
brief
eclipse
there
was
one
teacher
who
necessity
had
armed
with
strength
and
wrong
against
mankind
his
slave
and
his
avenger
aye
to
be
that
we
were
weak
and
sinful
frail
and
blind
and
that
the
will
of
one
was
peace
and
we
should
seek
for
nought
on
earth
but
toil
and
misery
for
thus
we
might
avoid
the
hell
hereafter
so
spake
the
hypocrites
who
cursed
and
lied
alas
their
sway
was
past
and
tears
and
laughter
clung
to
their
hoary
hair
withering
the
pride
which
in
their
hollow
hearts
dared
still
abide
and
yet
obscener
slaves
with
smoother
brow
and
sneers
on
their
strait
lips
thin
blue
and
wide
said
that
the
rule
of
men
was
over
now
and
hence
the
subject
world
to
woman
will
must
bow
gold
was
scattered
through
the
streets
and
wine
flowed
at
a
hundred
feasts
within
the
wall
in
vain
the
steady
towers
in
heaven
did
shine
as
they
were
wont
nor
at
the
priestly
call
left

her
banquet
in

at

who
throng
to
kneel
for

nor

dimmed
hope
newly
kindled
flame
gold
was
as
a
god
whose
faith
began
to
fade
so
that
its
worshippers
were
few
and
faith
itself
which
in
the
heart
of
man
gives
shape
voice
name
to
spectral
terror
knew
its
downfall
as
the
altars
lonelier
grew
till
the
priests
stood
alone
within
the
fane
the
shafts
of
falsehood
unpolluting
flew
and
the
cold
sneers
of
calumny
were
vain
the
union
of
the

discord
brand
to
stain
rest
thou
lo
we
two
are
here
we
have
survived
a
ruin
wide
and
deep
strange
thoughts

i
can
not
grieve
or
fear
sitting
with
thee
upon
this
lonely
steep
i
smile
though
human
love
should
make
me
weep
we
have
survived
a
joy
that
knows
no
sorrow
and
i
do
feel
a
mighty
calmness
creep
over
my
heart
which
can
no
longer
borrow
its
hues
from
chance
or
change
dark
children
of
know
not
what
will
come
yet
laon
dearest
cythna
shall
be
the
prophetess
of

her
lips
shall
rob
thee
of
the
grace
thou
wearest
to
hide
thy

sounds
from

which
was

the

nightingale
has
answered
me
with
her
most
soothing
song
out

the

by
that
proud
neigh

each

that
mighty
steed
bore
me
abroad

i
returned
with

to
our
retreat
and
dark

the

which
flowed
over
the

had
stained

make
behind

a
chasm
like

wake
for
from
the
utmost
realms
of
earth
came
pouring
the
banded
slaves
whom
every
despot
sent
at
that
throned
traitor
summons
like
the
roaring
of
fire
whose
floods
the

circumvent

the
scorched

of

so
bent
the
armies
of
the
leagued
kings
around
their

the

trembled
as

from

of

they
came
the

they
came
like

whom
from

the

led
them

took
his

be

answered
we
fear
the

morn
is
drawing
near
we
were
slaying
still
without
remorse
and
now
that
dreadful
chief
beneath
my
hand
defenceless
lay
when
on
a
horse
an
angel
bright
as
day
waving
a
brand
which
flashed
among
the
stars
passed
thou
stand
parleying
with
me
thou
wretch
the
king
replied
bind
him
to

and
of
this

whoso
will
drag
that
woman
to
his
side
that
scared
him
thus
may
burn
his
dearest
foe
beside
gold
and

forth
they
rushed
into
the
loud

the
roar
of
their
career
the
horsemen
shook
the
earth
the
wheeled
artillery

the
pavement
tore
the
infantry

after

did
pour
their
clouds
on
the

five
days
they
slew
among
the
wasted
fields
the
sixth
saw
gore
stream
through
the
city
on
the
seventh
the
dew
of
slaughter
became
stiff
and
there
was
peace
anew
peace
in
the
desert
fields
and
villages
between
the
glutted
beasts
and
mangled
dead
peace
in
the
silent
streets
save
when
the
cries
of
victims
to
their
fiery
judgement
led
made
pale
their
voiceless
lips
who
seemed
to
dread
even
in
their
dearest
kindred
lest
some
tongue
be
faithless
to
the
fear
yet
unbetrayed
peace
in
the
tyrant
palace
where
the
throng
waste
the
triumphal
hours
in
festival
and
song
day
after
day
the
burning
sun
rolled
on
over
the
land
it
came
out
of
the
east
like
fire
and
fiercely
shone
a
lamp
of
autumn
ripening
with
its
flame
the
few
lone
ears
of
corn
the
sky
became
stagnate
with
heat
so
that
each
cloud
and
blast
languished
and
died
the
thirsting
air
did
claim
all
moisture
and
a
rotting
vapour
passed
from
the
unburied
dead
invisible
and
fast
first
want
then
plague
came
on
the
beasts
their
food
failed
and
they
drew
the
breath
of
its
decay
millions
on
millions
whom
the
scent
of
blood
had
lured
or
who
from
regions
far
away
had
tracked
the
hosts
in
festival
array
from
their
dark
deserts
gaunt
and
wasting
now
stalked
like
fell
shades
among
their
perished
prey
in
their
green
eyes
a
strange
disease
did
glow
they
sank
in
hideous
spasm
or
pains
severe
and
slow
the
fish
were
poisoned
in
the
streams
the
birds
in
the
green
woods
perished
the
insect
race
was
withered
up
the
scattered
flocks
and
herds
who
had
survived
the
wild
beasts
hungry
chase
died
moaning
each
upon
the
other
face
in
helpless
agony
gazing
round
the
city
all
night
the
lean
hyaenas
their
sad
case
like
starving
infants
wailed
a
woeful
ditty
and
many
a
mother
wept
pierced
with
unnatural
pity
amid
the
aereal
minarets
on
high
the
ethiopian
vultures
fluttering
fell
from
their
long
line
of
brethren
in
the
sky
startling
the
concourse
of
too
well
these
signs
the
coming
mischief
did
foretell
strange
panic
first
a
deep
and
sickening
dread
within
each
heart
like
ice
did
sink
and
dwell
a
voiceless
thought
of
evil
which
did
spread
with
the
quick
glance
of
eyes
like
withering
lightnings
shed
day
after
day
when
the
year
wanes
the
frosts
strip
its
green
crown
of
leaves
till
all
is
bare
so
on
those
strange
and
congregated
hosts
came
famine
a
swift
shadow
and
the
air
groaned
with
the
burden
of
a
new
despair
famine
than
whom
misrule
no
deadlier
daughter
feeds
from
her
thousand
breasts
though
sleeping
there
with
lidless
eyes
lie
faith
and
plague
and
slaughter
a
ghastly
brood
conceived
of
lethe
sullen
water
there
was
no
food
the
corn
was
trampled
down
the
flocks
and
herds
had
perished
on
the
shore
the
dead
and
putrid
fish
were
ever
thrown
the
deeps
were
foodless
and
the
winds
no
more
creaked
with
the
weight
of
birds
but
as
before
those
winged
things
sprang
forth
were
void
of
shade
the
vines
and
orchards
autumn
golden
store
were
burned
so
that
the
meanest
food
was
weighed
with
gold
and
avarice
died
before
the
god
it
made
there
was
no
corn
in
the
wide
all
loathliest
things
even
human
flesh
was
sold
they
weighed
it
in
small
scales
and
many
a
face
was
fixed
in
eager
horror
then
his
gold
the
miser
brought
the
tender
maid
grown
bold
through
hunger
bared
her
scorned
charms
in
vain
the
mother
brought
her
eldest
born
controlled
by
instinct
blind
as
love
but
turned
again
and
bade
her
infant
suck
and
died
in
silent
pain
then
fell
blue
plague
upon
the
race
of
man
for
the
sheathed
steel
so
late
which
gave
oblivion
to
the
dead
when
the
streets
ran
with
brothers
blood
o
that
the
earthquake
grave
would
gape
or
ocean
lift
its
stifling
wave
vain
cries
throughout
the
streets
thousands
pursued
each
by
his
fiery
torture
howl
and
rave
or
sit
in
frenzy
unimagined
mood
upon
fresh
heaps
of
dead
a
ghastly
multitude
it
was
not
hunger
now
but
thirst
each
well
was
choked
with
rotting
corpses
and
became
a
cauldron
of
green
mist
made
visible
at
sunrise
thither
still
the
myriads
came
seeking
to
quench
the
agony
of
the
flame
which
raged
like
poison
through
their
bursting
veins
naked
they
were
from
torture
without
shame
spotted
with
nameless
scars
and
lurid
blains
childhood
and
youth
and
age
writhing
in
savage
pains
it
was
not
thirst
but
madness
many
saw
their
own
lean
image
everywhere
it
went
a
ghastlier
self
beside
them
till
the
awe
of
that
dread
sight
to
sent
those
shrieking
victims
some
ere
life
was
spent
sought
with
a
horrid
sympathy
to
shed
contagion
on
the
sound
and
others
rent
their
matted
hair
and
cried
aloud
tread
on
fire
the
avenging
power
his
hell

spread
sometimes
the

the
dead
were
hid
near
the
great
fountain
in
the
public
square
where
corpses
made
a
crumbling
pyramid
under
the
sun
was
heard
one
stifled
prayer
for
life
in
the
hot
silence
of
the
air
and
strange
was
amid
that
hideous
heap
to
see
some
shrouded
in
their
long
and
golden
hair
as
if
not
dead
but
slumbering
quietly
like
forms
which
sculptors
carve
then
love
to
agony
famine
had
spared
the
palace
of
the
king
he
rioted
in
festival
the
while
he
and
his
guards
and
priests
but
plague
did
fling
one
shadow
upon
all
famine
can
smile
on
him
who
brings
it
food
and
pass
with
guile
of
thankful
falsehood
like
a
courtier
gray
the
of
the
throne
but
many
a
mile
comes
plague
a
winged
wolf
who
loathes
alway
the
garbage
and
the
scum
that
strangers
make
her
prey
so
near
the
throne
amid
the
gorgeous
feast
sheathed
in
resplendent
arms
or
loosely
dight
to
luxury
ere
the
mockery
yet
had
ceased
that
lingered
on
his
lips
the
warrior
might
was
loosened
and
a
new
and
ghastlier
night
in
dreams
of
frenzy
lapped
his
eyes
he
fell
headlong
or
with
stiff
eyeballs
sate
upright
among
the
guests
or
raving
mad
did
tell
strange
truths
a
dying
seer
of
dark
oppression
hell
the
princes
and
the
priests
were
pale
with
terror
that
monstrous
faith
wherewith
they
ruled
mankind
fell
like
a
shaft
loosed
by
the
bowman
error
on
their
own
hearts
they
sought
and
they
could
find
no
refuge
was
the
blind
who
led
the
blind
so
through
the
desolate
streets
to
the
high
fane
the
and
endless
armies
wind
in
sad
procession
each
among
the
train
to
his
own
idol
lifts
his
supplications
vain
god
they
cried
know
our
secret
pride
has
scorned
thee
and
thy
worship
and
thy
name
secure
in
human
power
we
have
defied
thy
fearful
might
we
bend
in
fear
and
shame
before
thy
presence
with
the
dust
we
claim
kindred
be
merciful
o
king
of
heaven
most
justly
have
we
suffered
for
thy
fame
made
dim
but
be
at
length
our
sins
forgiven
ere
to
despair
and
death
thy
worshippers
be
driven
king
of
glory
thou
alone
hast
power
who
can
resist
thy

who
can
restrain
thy
wrath
when
on
the
guilty
thou
dost
shower
the
shafts
of
thy
revenge
a
blistering
rain
greatest
and
best
be
merciful
again
have
we
not
stabbed
thine
enemies
and
made
the
earth
an
altar
and
the
heavens
a
fane
where
thou
wert
worshipped
with
their
blood
and
laid
those
hearts
in
dust
which
would
thy
searchless
works
have
weighed
didst
thou
loosen
on
this
impious
city
thine
angels
of
revenge
recall
them
now
thy
worshippers
abased
here
kneel
for
pity
and
bind
their
souls
by
an
immortal
vow
we
swear
by
thee
and
to
our
oath
do
thou
give
sanction
from
thine
hell
of
fiends
and
flame
that
we
will
kill
with
fire
and
torments
slow
the
last
of
those
who
mocked
thy
holy
name
and
scorned
the
sacred
laws
thy
prophets
did
proclaim
thus
they
with
trembling
limbs
and
pallid
lips
worshipped
their
own
hearts
image
dim
and
vast
scared
by
the
shade
wherewith
they
would
eclipse
the
light
of
other
minds
troubled
they
passed
from
the
great
temple
fiercely
still
and
fast
the
arrows
of
the
plague
among
them
fell
and
they
on
one
another
gazed
aghast
and
through
the
hosts
contention
wild
befell
as
each
of
his

god
the
wondrous
works
did
tell
and
oromaze

zerdusht
and

and
foh
a
tumult
of
strange
names
which
never
met
before
as
watchwords
of
a
single
woe
arose
each
raging
votary
to
throw
aloft
his
armed
hands
and
each
did
howl
god
alone
is
god
and
slaughter
now
would
have
gone
forth
when
from
beneath
a
cowl
a
voice
came
forth
which
pierced
like
ice
through
every
soul
was
an
iberian
priest
from
whom
it
came
a
zealous
man
who
led
the
legioned
west
with
words
which
faith
and
pride
had
steeped
in
flame
to
quell
the
unbelievers
a
dire
guest
even
to
his
friends
was
he
for
in
his
breast
did
hate
and
guile
lie
watchful
intertwined
twin
serpents
in
one
deep
and
winding
nest
he
loathed
all
faith
beside
his
own
and
pined
to
wreak
his
fear
of
heaven
in
vengeance
on
mankind
but
more
he
loathed
and
hated
the
clear
light
of
wisdom
and
free
thought
and
more
did
fear
lest
kindled
once
its
beams
might
pierce
the
night
even
where
his
idol
stood
for
far
and
near
did
many
a
heart
in
europe
leap
to
hear
that
faith
and
tyranny
were
trampled
down
many
a
pale
victim
doomed
for
truth
to
share
the
murderer
cell
or
see
with
helpless
groan
the
priests
his
children
drag
for
slaves
to
serve
their
own
he
dared
not
kill
the
infidels
with
fire
or
steel
in
europe
the
slow
agonies
of
legal
torture
mocked
his
keen
desire
so
he
made
truce
with
those
who
did
despise
the
expiation
and
the
sacrifice
that
though
detested
islam
kindred
creed
might
crush
for
him
those
deadlier
enemies
for
fear
of
god
did
in
his
bosom
breed
a
jealous
hate
of
man
an
unreposing
need
peace
he
cried
we
are
dead
the
day
of
judgement
comes
and
all
shall
surely
know
whose
god
is
god
each
fearfully
shall
pay
the
errors
of
his
faith
in
endless
woe
but
there
is
sent
a
mortal
vengeance
now
on
earth
because
an
impious
race
had
spurned
him
whom
we
all
adore
a
subtle
foe
by
whom
for
ye
this
dread
reward
was
earned
and
kingly
thrones
which
rest
on
faith
nigh
overturned
ye
because
ye
weep
and
kneel
and
pray
that
god
will
lull
the
pestilence
it
rose
even
from
beneath
his
throne
where
many
a
day
his
mercy
soothed
it
to
a
dark
repose
it
walks
upon
the
earth
to
judge
his
foes
and
what
are
thou
and
i
that
he
should
deign
to
curb
his
ghastly
minister
or
close
the
gates
of
death
ere
they
receive
the
twain
who
shook
with
mortal
spells
his
undefended
reign
there
is
famine
in
the
gulf
of
hell
its
giant
worms
of
fire
for
ever
their
lurid
eyes
are
on
us
those
who
fell
by
the
swift
shafts
of
pestilence
ere
dawn
are
in
their
jaws
they
hunger
for
the
spawn
of
satan
their
own
brethren
who
were
sent
to
make
our
souls
their
spoil
see
see
they
fawn
like
dogs
and
they
will
sleep
with
luxury
spent
when
those
detested
hearts
their
iron
fangs
have
rent
god
may
then
lull
pestilence
to
sleep
pile
high
the
pyre
of
expiation
now
a
forest
spoil
of
boughs
and
on
the
heap
pour
venomous
gums
which
sullenly
and
slow
when
touched
by
flame
shall
burn
and
melt
and
flow
a
stream
of
clinging
fire
and
fix
on
high
a
net
of
iron
and
spread
forth
below
a
couch
of
snakes
and
scorpions
and
the
fry
of
centipedes
and
worms
earth
hellish
progeny
laon
and
laone
on
that
pyre
linked
tight
with
burning
brass
perish
then
pray
that
with
this
sacrifice
the
withering
ire
of
heaven
may
be
appeased
he
ceased
and
they
a
space
stood
silent
as
far
far
away
the
echoes
of
his
voice
among
them
died
and
he
knelt
down
upon
the
dust
alway
muttering
the
curses
of
his
speechless
pride
whilst
shame
and
fear
and
awe
the
armies
did
divide
his
voice
was
like
a
blast
that
burst
the
portal
of
fabled
hell
and
as
he
spake
each
one
saw
gape
beneath
the
chasms
of
fire
immortal
and
heaven
above
seemed
cloven
where
on
a
throne
girt
round
with
storms
and
shadows
sate
alone
their
king
and
judge
fear
killed
in
every
breast
all
natural
pity
then
a
fear
unknown
before
and
with
an
inward
fire
possessed
they
raged
like
homeless
beasts
whom
burning
woods
invest
was
at
noon
the
public
crier
went
forth
proclaiming
through
the
living
and
the
dead
monarch
saith
that
his
great
empire
worth
is
set
on
laon
and
laone
head
he
who
but
one
yet
living
here
can
lead
or
who
the
life
from
both
their
hearts
can
wring
shall
be
the
kingdom
heir
a
glorious
meed
but
he
who
both
alive
can
hither
bring
the
princess
shall
espouse
and
reign
an
equal
king
ere
night
the
pyre
was
piled
the
net
of
iron
was
spread
above
the
fearful
couch
below
it
overtopped
the
towers
that
did
environ
that
spacious
square
for
fear
is
never
slow
to
build
the
thrones
of
hate
her
mate
and
foe
so
she
scourged
forth
the
maniac
multitude
to
rear
this
pyramid
tottering
and
slow
foodless
like
lean
herds
pursued
by
gadflies
they
have
piled
the
heath
and
gums
and
wood
night
came
a
starless
and
a
moonless
gloom
until
the
dawn
those
hosts
of
many
a
nation
stood
round
that
pile
as
near
one
lover
tomb
two
gentle
sisters
mourn
their
desolation
and
in
the
silence
of
that
expectation
was
heard
on
high
the
reptiles
hiss
and
crawl
it
was
so
deep
save
when
the
devastation
of
the
swift
pest
with
fearful
interval
marking
its
path
with
shrieks
among
the
crowd
would
fall
morn
came
among
those
sleepless
multitudes
madness
and
fear
and
plague
and
famine
still
heaped
corpse
on
corpse
as
in
autumnal
woods
the
frosts
of
many
a
wind
with
dead
leaves
fill
earth
cold
and
sullen
brooks
in
silence
still
the
pale
survivors
stood
ere
noon
the
fear
of
hell
became
a
panic
which
did
kill
like
hunger
or
disease
with
whispers
drear
as
hark
come
they
yet
just
heaven
thine
hour
is
near
and
priests
rushed
through
their
ranks
some
counterfeiting
the
rage
they
did
inspire
some
mad
indeed
with
their
own
lies
they
said
their
god
was
waiting
to
see
his
enemies
writhe
and
burn
and
bleed
and
that
till
then
the
snakes
of
hell
had
need
of
human
souls
three
hundred
furnaces
soon
blazed
through
the
wide
city
where
with
speed
men
brought
their
infidel
kindred
to
appease
god
wrath
and
while
they
burned
knelt
round
on
quivering
knees
the
noontide
sun
was
darkened
with
that
smoke
the
winds
of
eve
dispersed
those
ashes
gray
the
madness
which
these
rites
had
lulled
awoke
again
at
who
shall
dare
to
say
the
deeds
which
night
and
fear
brought
forth
or
weigh
in
balance
just
the
good
and
evil
there
he
might
man
deep
and
searchless
heart
display
and
cast
a
light
on
those
dim
labyrinths
where
hope
near
imagined
chasms
is
struggling
with
despair
is
said
a
mother
dragged
three
children
then
to
those
fierce
flames
which
roast
the
eyes
in
the
head
and
laughed
and
died
and
that
unholy
men
feasting
like
fiends
upon
the
infidel
dead
looked
from
their
meal
and
saw
an
angel
tread
the
visible
floor
of
heaven
and
it
was
she
and
on
that
night
one
without
doubt
or
dread
came
to
the
fire
and
said
i
am
he
kill
me
they
burned
them
both
with
hellish
mockery
and
one
by
one
that
night
young
maidens
came
beauteous
and
calm
like
shapes
of
living
stone
clothed
in
the
light
of
dreams
and
by
the
flame
which
shrank
as
overgorged
they
laid
them
down
and
sung
a
low
sweet
song
of
which
alone
one
word
was
heard
and
that
was
liberty
and
that
some
kissed
their
marble
feet
with
moan
like
love
and
died
and
then
that
they
did
die
with
happy
smiles
which
sunk
in
white
tranquillity

the

had
blown
her

apart
through
which
her

and

shone
a
cloud
was
hanging
the
western
mountains
before
its
blue
and
moveless
depth
were
flying
gray
mists
poured
forth
from
the
unresting
fountains
of
darkness
in

the

sudden
the
sun
shone
forth
its

lying
like
boiling
gold
on
ocean
strange
to

on
the
shattered
vapours
which
defying
the
power
of

in

tossed
restlessly
in
the

like
wrecks
in

sea
it
was
a
stream
of
living
beams
whose
bank
on
either
side
by
the
cloud
cleft
was
made
and
where
its
chasms
that
flood
of
glory
drank
its
waves
gushed
forth
like
fire
and
as
if
swayed
by
some
mute
tempest
rolled
on

the
shade

on

rapture
and
love
and
admiration
wrought
a
passion
deeper
far
than
tears
or
mirth
or

or
has
birth
from
common
joy
which
with
the
speechless
feeling
that
led
her
there
united
and
shot
forth
from
her
far
eyes
a
light
of
deep
revealing
all
but
her
dearest
self
from
my
regard
concealing
her
lips
were
parted
and
the
measured
breath
was
now
heard
there
her
dark
and
intricate
eyes
orb
within
orb
deeper
than
sleep
or
death
absorbed
the
glories
of
the
burning
skies
which
mingling
with
her
heart
deep
ecstasies
burst
from
her
looks
and
gestures
and
a
light
of
liquid
tenderness
like
love
did
rise
from
her
whole
frame
an
atmosphere
which
quite
arrayed
her
in
its
beams
tremulous
and
soft
and
bright
she
would
have
clasped
me
to
her
glowing
frame
those
warm
and
odorous
lips
might
soon
have
shed
on
mine
the
fragrance
and
the
invisible
flame
which
now
the
cold
winds
stole
she
would
have
laid
upon
my
languid
heart
her
dearest
head
i
might
have
heard
her

tender

her

never

heard
me
as
i
fled
her
eager
tone
sunk
on
my
heart
and
almost
wove
a
chain
around
my
will
to
link
it
with

that
my
stern

almost
gone

faint

back
thou
dearest

return
ah
me
return
the
wind
passed
by
on
which
those
accents
died
faint
far
and
lingeringly
woe
woe
that
moonless
midnight
want
and
pest
were
horrible
but
one
more
fell
doth
rear
as
in
a
hydra
swarming
lair
its
crest
eminent
among
those
victims
even
the
fear
of
hell
each
girt
by
the
hot
atmosphere
of
his
blind
agony
like
a
scorpion
stung
by
his
own
rage
upon
his
burning
bier
of
circling
coals
of
fire
but
still
there
clung
one
hope
like
a
keen
sword
on
starting
threads
uphung
not
death
death
was
no
more
refuge
or
rest
not
life
it
was
despair
to
be
not
sleep
for
fiends
and
chasms
of
fire
had
dispossessed
all
natural
dreams
to
wake
was
not
to
weep
but
to
gaze
mad
and
pallid
at
the
leap
to
which
the
future
like
a
snaky
scourge
or
like
some
tyrant
eye
which
aye
doth
keep
its
withering
beam
upon
his
slaves
did
urge
their
steps
they
heard
the
roar
of
hell
sulphureous
surge
each
of
that
multitude
alone
and
lost
to
sense
of
outward
things
one
hope
yet
knew
as
on
a
crag
some
seaman
tossed
stares
at
the
rising
tide
or
like
the
crew
whilst
now
the
ship
is
splitting
through
and
through
each
if
the
tramp
of
a
far
steed
was
heard
started
from
sick
despair
or
if
there
flew
one
murmur
on
the
wind
or
if
some
word
which
none
can
gather
yet
the
distant
crowd
has
stirred
why
became
cheeks
wan
with
the
kiss
of
death
paler
from
hope
they
had
sustained
despair
why
watched
those
myriads
with
suspended
breath
sleepless
a
second
night
they
are
not
here
the
victims
and
hour
by
hour
a
vision
drear
warm
corpses
fall
upon
the
dead
and
even
in
death
their
lips
are
wreathed
with
the
crowd

mute
and
moveless
overhead
silent
arcturus
shines
thou
not
the
tread
rushing
feet
laughter
the
shout
the
scream
of
triumph
not
to
be
contained
see
hark
they
come
they
come
give
way
alas
ye
deem
falsely
is
but
a
crowd
of
maniacs
stark
driven
like
a
troop
of
spectres
through
the
dark
from
the
choked
well
whence
a
bright
sprung
a
lurid
which
dropped
many
a
spark
from
its
blue
train
and
spreading
widely
clung
to
their
wild
hair
like
mist
the
topmost
pines
among
and
many
from
the
crowd
collected
there
joined
that
strange
dance
in
fearful
sympathies
there
was
the
silence
of
a
long
despair
when
the
last
echo
of
those
terrible
cries
came
from
a
distant
street
like
agonies
stifled
before
the
tyrant
throne
all
night
his
aged
senate
sate
their
eyes
in
stony
expectation
fixed
when
one
sudden
before
them
stood
a
stranger
and
alone
dark
priests
and
haughty
warriors
gazed
on
him
with
baffled
wonder
for
a
hermit
vest
concealed
his
face
but
when
he
spake
his
tone
ere
yet
the
matter
did
their
thoughts
arrest
earnest
benignant
calm
as
from
a
breast
void
of
all
hate
or
terror
made
them
start
for
as
with
gentle
accents
he
addressed
his
speech
to
them
on
each
unwilling
heart
unusual
awe
did
fall
a
dart
princes
of
the
earth
ye
sit
aghast
amid
the
ruin
which
yourselves
have
made
yes
desolation
heard
your
trumpet
blast
and
sprang
from
sleep
dark
terror
has
obeyed
your
bidding
o
that
i
whom
ye
have
made
your
foe
could
set
my
dearest
enemy
free
from
pain
and
fear
but
evil
casts
a
shade
which
can
not
pass
so
soon
and
hate
must
be
the
nurse
and
parent
still
of
an
ill
progeny
turn
to
heaven
for
aid
in
your
distress
alas
that
ye
the
mighty
and
the
wise
who
if
ye
dared
might
not
aspire
to
less
than
ye
conceive
of
power
should
fear
the
lies
which
thou
and
thou
didst
frame
for
mysteries
to
blind
your
slaves
consider
your
own
thought
an
empty
and
a
cruel
sacrifice
ye
now
prepare
for
a
vain
idol
wrought
out
of
the
fears
and
hate
which
vain
desires
have
brought
seek
for
happiness
alas
the
day
ye
find
it
not
in
luxury
nor
in
gold
nor
in
the
fame
nor
in
the
envied
sway
for
which
o
willing
slaves
to
custom
old
severe
taskmistress
ye
your
hearts
have
sold
ye
seek
for
peace
and
when
ye
die
to
dream
no
evil
dreams
all
mortal
things
are
cold
and
senseless
then
if
aught
survive
i
deem
it
must
be
love
and
joy
for
they
immortal
seem
not
the
future
weep
not
for
the
past
oh
could
i
win
your
ears
to
dare
be
now
glorious
and
great
and
calm
that
ye
would
cast
into
the
dust
those
symbols
of
your
woe
purple
and
gold
and
steel
that
ye
would
go
proclaiming
to
the
nations
whence
ye
came
that
want
and
plague
and
fear
from
slavery
flow
and
that
mankind
is
free
and
that
the
shame
of
royalty
and
faith
is
lost
in
freedom
fame
thus
is
well
if
not
i
come
to
say
that
laon
while
the
stranger
spoke
among
the
council
sudden
tumult
and
affray
arose
for
many
of
those
warriors
young
had
on
his
eloquent
accents
fed
and
hung
like
bees
on
they
knew
the
truth
and
from
their
thrones
in
vindication
sprung
the
men
of
faith
and
law
then
without
ruth
drew
forth
their
secret
steel
and
stabbed
each
ardent
youth
they
stabbed
them
in
the
back
and
sneered
a
slave
who
stood
behind
the
throne
those
corpses
drew
each
to
its
bloody
dark
and
secret
grave
and
one
more
daring
raised
his
steel
anew
to
pierce
the
stranger
hast
thou
to
do
with
me
poor
wretch
calm
solemn
and
severe
that
voice
unstrung
his
sinews
and
he
threw
his
dagger
on
the
ground
and
pale
with
fear
sate
silently
his
voice
then
did
the
stranger
rear
doth
avail
not
that
i
weep
for
ye
ye
can
not
change
since
ye
are
old
and
gray
and
ye
have
chosen
your

your

flying
upon
the

from

among

in

closed
their

eyes
from

to
house
replying
with
loud
acclaim
the
living
shook

cope
and
filled
the
startled
earth
with
echoes
morn
did
ope
its
pale
eyes
then
and
lo
the
long
array
of
guards
in
golden
arms
and
priests
beside
singing
their
bloody
hymns
whose
garbs
betray
the
blackness
of
the
faith
it
seems
to
hide
and
see
the
tyrant
chariot
glide
among
the
gloomy
cowls
and
glittering
spears
a
shape
of
light
is
sitting
by
his
side
a
child
most
beautiful
i
the
midst
appears
laon
exempt
alone
from
mortal
hopes
and
fears
his
head
and
feet
are
bare
his
hands
are
bound
behind
with
heavy
chains
yet
none
do
wreak
their
scoffs
on
him
though
myriads
throng
around
there
are
no
sneers
upon
his
lip
which
speak
that
scorn
or
hate
has
made
him
bold
his
cheek
resolve
has
not
turned
pale
his
eyes
are
mild
and
calm
and
like
the
morn
about
to
break
smile
on
mankind
his
heart
seems
reconciled
to
all
things
and
itself
like
a
reposing
child
tumult
was
in
the
soul
of
all
beside
ill
joy
or
doubt
or
fear
but
those
who
saw
their
tranquil
victim
pass
felt
wonder
glide
into
their
brain
and
became
calm
with
see
the
slow
pageant
near
the
pile
doth
draw
a
thousand
torches
in
the
spacious
square
borne
by
the
ready
slaves
of
ruthless
law
await
the
signal
round
the
morning
fair
is
changed
to
a
dim
night
by
that
unnatural
glare
and
see
beneath
a
canopy
upon
a
platform
level
with
the
pile
the
anxious
tyrant
sit
enthroned
on
high
girt
by
the
chieftains
of
the
host
all
smile
in
expectation
but
one
child
the
while
i
laon
led
by
mutes
ascend
my
bier
of
fire
and
look
around
each
distant
isle
is
dark
in
the
bright
dawn
towers
far
and
near
pierce
like
reposing
flames
the
tremulous
atmosphere
there
was
such
silence
through
the
host
as
when
an
earthquake
trampling
on
some
populous
town
has
crushed
ten
thousand
with
one
tread
and
men
expect
the
second
all
were
mute
but
one
that
fairest
child
who
bold
with
love
alone
stood
up
before
the
king
without
avail
pleading
for
laon
life
her
stifled
groan
was
heard
she
trembled
like
one
aspen
pale
among
the
gloomy
pines
of
a
norwegian
vale
what
were
his
thoughts
linked
in
the
morning
sun
among
those
reptiles
stingless
with
delay
even
like
a
tyrant
wrath
the
roared
hark
again
in
that
dread
pause
he
lay
as
in
a
quiet
dream
the
slaves
obey
a
thousand
torches
drop
and
hark
the
last
bursts
on
that
awful
silence
far
away
millions
with
hearts
that
beat
both
loud
and
fast
watch
for
the
springing
flame
expectant
and
aghast
they
fly
the
torches
fall
a
cry
of
fear
has
startled
the
triumphant
they
recede
for
ere
the
cannon
roar
has
died
they
hear
the
tramp
of
hoofs
like
earthquake
and
a
steed
dark
and
gigantic
with
the
tempest
speed
bursts
through
their
ranks
a
woman
sits
thereon
fairer
it
seems
than
aught
that
earth
can
breed
calm
radiant
like
the
phantom
of
the
dawn
a
spirit
from
the
caves
of
daylight
wandering
gone
all
thought
it
was
god
angel
come
to
sweep
the
lingering
guilty
to
their
fiery
grave
the
tyrant
from
his
throne
in
dread
did
leap
her
innocence
his
child
from
fear
did
save
scared
by
the
faith
they
feigned
each
priestly
slave
knelt
for
his
mercy
whom
they
served
with
blood
and
like
the
refluence
of
a
mighty
wave
sucked
into
the
loud
sea
the
multitude
with
crushing
panic
fled
in
terror
altered
mood
they
pause
they
blush
they
gaze
a
gathering
shout
bursts
like
one
sound
from
the
ten
thousand
streams
of
a
tempestuous
sea
that
sudden
rout
one
checked
who
never
in
his
mildest
dreams
felt
awe
from
grace
or
loveliness
the
seams
of
his
rent
heart
so
hard
and
cold
a
creed
had
seared
with
blistering
ice
but
he
misdeems
that
he
is
wise
whose
wounds
do
only
bleed
inly
for
self
thus
thought
the
iberian
priest
indeed
and
others
too
thought
he
was
wise
to
see
in
pain
and
fear
and
hate
something
divine
in
love
and
beauty
no
now
with
a
bitter
smile
whose
light
did
shine
like
a
fiend
hope
upon
his
lips
and
eyne
he
said
and
the
persuasion
of
that
sneer
rallied
his
trembling
comrades
it
mine
to
stand
alone
when
kings
and
soldiers
fear
a
woman
heaven
has
sent
its
other
victim
here
it
not
impious
said
the
king
break
our
holy
oath
to
keep
it
say
shrieked
the
exulting
priest
to
the
stake
bind
her
and
on
my
head
the
burden
lay
of
her
just
torments
at
the
judgement
day
will
i
stand
up
before
the
golden
throne
of
heaven
and
cry
to
thee
did
i
betray
an
infidel
but
for
me
she
would
have
known
another
moment
joy
the
glory
be
thine
own
they
trembled
but
replied
not
nor
obeyed
pausing
in
breathless
silence
cythna
sprung
from
her
gigantic
steed
who
like
a
shade
chased
by
the
winds
those
vacant
streets
among
fled
tameless
as
the
brazen
rein
she
flung
upon
his
neck
and
kissed
his
mooned
brow
a
piteous
sight
that
one
so
fair
and
young
the
clasp
of
such
a
fearful
death
should
woo
with
smiles
of
tender
joy
as
beamed
from
cythna
now
the
warm
tears
burst
in
spite
of
faith
and
fear
from
many
a
tremulous
eye
but
like
soft
dews
which
feed
spring
earliest
buds
hung
gathered
there
frozen
by
doubt
alas
they
could
not
choose
but
weep
for
when
her
faint
limbs
did
refuse
to
climb
the
pyre
upon
the
mutes
she
smiled
and
with
her
eloquent
gestures
and
the
hues
of
her
quick
lips
even
as
a
weary
child
wins
sleep
from
some
fond
nurse
with
its
caresses
mild
she
won
them
though
unwilling
her
to
bind
near
me
among
the
snakes
when
there
had
fled
one
soft
reproach
that
was
most
thrilling
kind
she
smiled
on
me
and
nothing
then
we
said
but
each
upon
the
other
countenance
fed
looks
of
insatiate
love
the
mighty
veil
which
doth
divide
the
living
and
the
dead
was
almost
rent
the
world
grew
dim
and
pale
all
light
in
heaven
or
earth
beside
our
love
did
yet
yet
one
brief
relapse
like
the
last
beam
of
dying
flames
the
stainless
air
around
hung
silent
and
serene
a
gleam
burst
upwards
hurling
fiercely
from
the
ground
the
globed
smoke
i
heard
the
mighty
sound
of
its
uprise
like
a
tempestuous
ocean
and
through
its
chasms
i
saw
as
in
a
swound
the
tyrant
child
fall
without
life
or
motion
before
his
throne
subdued
by
some
unseen
and
is
this
death
the
pyre
has
disappeared
the
pestilence
the
tyrant
and
the
throng
the
flames
grow
silent
slowly
there
is
heard
the
music
of
a
song
which
like
the
kiss
of
love
when
life
is
young
steeps
the
faint
eyes
in
darkness
sweet
and
deep
with
notes
it
floats
along
till
on
my
passive
soul
there
seemed
to
creep
a
melody
like
waves
on
wrinkled
sands
that
leap
the
warm
touch
of
a
soft
and
tremulous
hand
wakened
me
then
lo
cythna
sate
reclined
beside
me
on
the
waved
and
golden
sand
of
a
clear
pool
upon
a
bank
with
strange
and
flowers
which
to
the
wind
breathed
divine
odour
high
above
was
spread
the
emerald
heaven
of
trees
of
unknown
kind
whose
moonlike
blooms
and
bright
fruit
overhead
a
shadow
which
was
light
upon
the
waters
shed
and
round
about
sloped
many
a
lawny
mountain
with
forests
and
vast
caves
of
marble
radiance
to
that
mighty
fountain
and
where
the
flood
its
own
bright
margin
laves
their
echoes
talk
with
its
eternal
waves
which
from
the
depths
whose
jagged
caverns
breed
their
unreposing
strife
it
lifts
and
heaves
till
through
a
chasm
of
hills
they
roll
and
feed
a
river
deep
which
flies
with
smooth
but
arrowy
speed
as
we
sate
gazing
in
a
trance
of
wonder
a
boat
approached
borne
by
the
musical
air
along
the
waves
which
sung
and
sparkled
under
its
rapid
keel
a
winged
shape
sate
there
a
child
with
wings
so
fair
that
as
her
bark
did
through
the
waters
glide
the
shadow
of
the
lingering
waves
did
wear
light
as
from
starry
beams
from
side
to
side
while
veering
to
the
wind
her
plumes
the
bark
did
guide
the
boat
was
one
curved
shell
of
hollow
pearl
almost
translucent
with
the
light
divine
of
her
within
the
prow
and
stern
did
curl
horned
on
high
like
the
young
moon
supine
when
dim
twilight
mountains
dark
with
pine
it
floats
upon
the
sunset
sea
of
beams
whose
golden
waves
in
many
a
purple
line
fade
fast
till
borne
on
sunlight
ebbing
streams
dilating
on
earth
verge
the
sunken
meteor
gleams
its
keel
has
struck
the
sands
beside
our
feet
then
cythna
turned
to
me
and
from
her
eyes
which
swam
with
unshed
tears
a
look
more
sweet
than
happy
love
a
wild
and
glad
surprise
glanced
as
she
spake
this
is
paradise
and
not
a
dream
and
we
are
all
united
lo
that
is
mine
own
child
who
in
the
guise
of
madness
came
like
day
to
one
benighted
in
lonesome
woods
my
heart
is
now
too
well
requited
and
then
she
wept
aloud
and
in
her
arms
clasped
that
bright
shape
less
marvellously
fair
than
her
own
human
hues
and
living
charms
which
as
she
leaned
in
passion
silence
there
breathed
warmth
on
the
cold
bosom
of
the
air
which
seemed
to
blush
and
tremble
with
delight
the
glossy
darkness
of
her
streaming
hair
fell
that
snowy
child
and
wrapped
from
sight
the
fond
and
long
embrace
which
did
their
hearts
unite
then
the
bright
child
the
plumed
seraph
came
and
fixed
its
blue
and
beaming
eyes
on
mine
and
said
was
disturbed
by
tremulous
shame
when
once
we
met
yet
knew
that
i
was
thine
from
the
same
hour
in
which
thy
lips
divine
kindled
a
clinging
dream
within
my
brain
which
ever
waked
when
i
might
sleep
to
twine
thine
image
with
her
memory
dear
again
we
meet
exempted
now
from
mortal
fear
or
pain
the
consuming
flames
had
wrapped
ye
round
the
hope
which
i
had
cherished
went
away
i
fell
in
agony
on
the
senseless
ground
and
hid
mine
eyes
in
dust
and
far
astray
my
mind
was
gone
when
bright
like
dawning
day
the
spectre
of
the
plague
before
me
flew
and
breathed
upon
my
lips
and
seemed
to
say
they
wait
for
thee
beloved
then
i
knew
the
on
my
breast
and
became
calm
anew
was
the
calm
of
love
for
i
was
dying
i
saw
the
black
and
pyre
in
its
own
gray
and
shrunken
ashes
lying
the
pitchy
smoke
of
the
departed
fire
still
hung
in
many
a
hollow
dome
and
spire
above
the
towers
like
night
beneath
whose
shade
awed
by
the
ending
of
their
own
desire
the
armies
stood
a
vacancy
was
made
in
expectation
depth
and
so
they
stood
dismayed
frightful
silence
of
that
altered
mood
the
tortures
of
the
dying
clove
alone
till
one
uprose
among
the
multitude
and
said
the
flood
of
time
is
rolling
on
we
stand
upon
its
brink
whilst
they
are
gone
to
glide
in
peace
down
death
mysterious
stream
have
ye
done
well
they
moulder
flesh
and
bone
who
might
have
made
this
life
envenomed
dream
a
sweeter
draught
than
ye
will
ever
taste
i
deem
these
perish
as
the
good
and
great
of
yore
have
perished
and
their
murderers
will
repent
yes
vain
and
barren
tears
shall
flow
before
yon
smoke
has
faded
from
the
firmament
even
for
this
cause
that
ye
who
must
lament
the
death
of
those
that
made
this
world
so
fair
can
not
recall
them
now
but
there
is
lent
to
man
the
wisdom
of
a
high
despair
when
such
can
die
and
he
live
on
and
linger
here
ay
ye
may
fear
not
now
the
pestilence
from
fabled
hell
as
by
a
charm
withdrawn
all
power
and
faith
must
pass
since
calmly
hence
in
pain
and
fire
have
unbelievers
gone
and
ye
must
sadly
turn
away
and
moan
in
secret
to
his
home
each
one
returning
and
to
long
ages
shall
this
hour
be
known
and
slowly
shall
its
memory
ever
burning
fill
this
dark
night
of
things
with
an
eternal
morning
for
me
that
world
is
grown
too
void
and
cold
since
hope
pursues
immortal
destiny
with
steps
thus
slow
therefore
shall
ye
behold
how
those
who
love
yet
fear
not
dare
to
die
tell
to
your
children
this
then
suddenly
he
sheathed
a
dagger
in
his
heart
and
fell
my
brain
grew
dark
in
death
and
yet
to
me
there
came
a
murmur
from
the
crowd
to
tell
of
deep
and
mighty
change
which
suddenly
befell
suddenly
i
stood
a
winged
thought
before
the
immortal
senate
and
the
seat
of
that
spirit
whence
is
wrought
the
strength
of
its
dominion
good
and
great
the
better
genius
of
this
world
estate
his
realm
around
one
mighty
fane
is
spread
elysian
islands
bright
and
fortunate
calm
dwellings
of
the
free
and
happy
dead
where
i
am
sent
to
lead
these
winged
words
she
said
and
with
the
silence
of
her
eloquent
smile
bade
us
embark
in
her
divine
canoe
then
at
the
helm
we
took
our
seat
the
while
above
her
head
those
plumes
of
dazzling
hue
into
the
winds
invisible
stream
she
threw
sitting
beside
the
prow
like
gossamer
on
the
swift
breath
of
morn
the
vessel
flew
the
bright
whirlpools
of
that
fountain
fair
whose
shores
receded
fast
while
we
seemed
lingering
there
till
down
that
mighty
stream
dark
calm
and
fleet
between
a
chasm
of
cedarn
mountains
riven
chased
by
the
thronging
winds
whose
viewless
feet
as
swift
as
twinkling
beams
had
under
heaven
from
woods
and
waves
wild
sounds
and
odours
driven
the
boat
fled
visibly
three
nights
and
days
borne
like
a
cloud
through
morn
and
noon
and
even
we
sailed
along
the
winding
watery
ways
of
the
vast
stream
a
long
and
labyrinthine
maze
a
scene
of
joy
and
wonder
to
behold
that
river
shapes
and
shadows
changing
ever
where
the
broad
sunrise
filled
with
deepening
gold
its
whirlpools
where
all
hues
did
spread
and
quiver
and
where
melodious
falls
did
burst
and
shiver
among
rocks
clad
with
flowers
the
foam
and
spray
sparkled
like
stars
upon
the
sunny
river
or
when
the
moonlight
poured
a
holier
day
one
vast
and
glittering
lake
around
green
islands
lay
morn
noon
and
even
that
boat
of
pearl
outran
the
streams
which
bore
it
like
the
arrowy
cloud
of
tempest
or
the
speedier
thought
of
man
which
flieth
forth
and
can
not
make
abode
sometimes
through
forests
deep
like
night
we
glode
between
the
walls
of
mighty
mountains
crowned
with
cyclopean
piles
whose
turrets
proud
the
homes
of
the
departed
dimly
frowned
the
bright
waves
which
girt
their
dark
foundations
round
sometimes
between
the
wide
and
flowering
meadows
mile
after
mile
we
sailed
and
was
delight
to
see
far
off
the
sunbeams
chase
the
shadows
over
the
grass
sometimes
beneath
the
night
of
wide
and
vaulted
caves
whose
roofs
were
bright
with
starry
gems
we
fled
whilst
from
their
deep
and
chasms
shades
beautiful
and
white
amid
sweet
sounds
across
our
path
would
sweep
like
swift
and
lovely
dreams
that
walk
the
waves
of
sleep
and
ever
as
we
sailed
our
minds
were
full
of
love
and
wisdom
which
would
overflow
in
converse
wild
and
sweet
and
wonderful
and
in
quick
smiles
whose
light
would
come
and
go
like
music
wide
waves
and
in
the
flow
of
sudden
tears
and
in
the
mute
caress
for
a
deep
shade
was
cleft
and
we
did
know
that
virtue
though
obscured
on
earth
not
less
survives
all
mortal
change
in
lasting
loveliness
three
days
and
nights
we
sailed
as
thought
and
feeling
number
delightful
hours
for
through
the
sky
the
sphered
lamps
of
day
and
night
revealing
new
changes
and
new
glories
rolled
on
high
sun
moon
and
moonlike
lamps
the
progeny
of
a
diviner
heaven
serene
and
fair
on
the
fourth
day
wild
as
a
windwrought
sea
the
stream
became
and
fast
and
faster
bare
the
boat
steadily
speeding
there
steady
and
swift
where
the
waves
rolled
like
mountains
within
the
vast
ravine
whose
rifts
did
pour
tumultuous
floods
from
their
ten
thousand
fountains
the
thunder
of
whose
roar
made
the
air
sweep
in
whirlwinds
from
the
shore
calm
as
a
shade
the
boat
of
that
fair
child
securely
fled
that
rapid
stress
before
amid
the
topmost
spray
and
sunbows
wild
wreathed
in
the
silver
mist
in
joy
and
pride
we
smiled
the
torrent
of
that
wide
and
raging
river
is
passed
and
our
aereal
speed
suspended
we
look
behind
a
golden
mist
did
quiver
when
its
wild
surges
with
the
lake
were
blended
our
bark
hung
there
as
on
a
line
suspended
between
two
heavens
that
windless
waveless
lake
which
four
great
cataracts
from
four
vales
attended
by
mists
aye
feed
from
rocks
and
clouds
they
break
and
of
that
azure
sea
a
silent
refuge
make
motionless
resting
on
the
lake
awhile
i
saw
its
marge
of
mountains
rear
their
peaks
aloft
i
saw
each
radiant
isle
and
in
the
midst
afar
even
like
a
sphere
hung
in
one
hollow
sky
did
there
appear
the
temple
of
the
spirit
on
the
sound
which
issued
thence
drawn
nearer
and
more
near
like
the
swift
moon
this
glorious
earth
around
the
charmed

note
on
the
revolt
of
islam
by
shelley
shelley
possessed
two
remarkable
qualities
of
intellect
a
brilliant
imagination
and
a
logical
exactness
of
reason
his
inclinations
led
him
he
fancied
almost
alike
to
poetry
and
metaphysical
discussions
i
say
fancied
because
i
believe
the
former
to
have
been
paramount
and
that
it
would
have
gained
the
mastery
even
had
he
struggled
against
it
however
he
said
that
he
deliberated
at
one
time
whether
he
should
dedicate
himself
to
poetry
or
metaphysics
and
resolving
on
the
former
he
educated
himself
for
it
discarding
in
a
great
measure
his
philosophical
pursuits
and
engaging
himself
in
the
study
of
the
poets
of
greece
italy
and
england
to
these
may
be
added
a
constant
perusal
of
portions
of
the
old
testament
the
psalms
the
book
of
job
the
prophet
isaiah
and
others
the
sublime
poetry
of
which
filled
him
with
delight
as
a
poet
his
intellect
and
compositions
were
powerfully
influenced
by
exterior
circumstances
and
especially
by
his
place
of
abode
he
was
very
fond
of
travelling
and
increased
this
restlessness
the
sufferings
occasioned
by
a
cold
english
winter
made
him
pine
especially
when
our
colder
spring
arrived
for
a
more
genial
climate
in
he
again
visited
switzerland
and
rented
a
house
on
the
banks
of
the
lake
of
geneva
and
many
a
day
in
cloud
or
sunshine
was
passed
alone
in
his
boat
sailing
as
the
wind
listed
or
weltering
on
the
calm
waters
the
majestic
aspect
of
nature
ministered
such
thoughts
as
he
afterwards
enwove
in
verse
his
lines
on
the
bridge
of
the
arve
and
his
hymn
to
intellectual
beauty
were
written
at
this
time
perhaps
during
this
summer
his
genius
was
checked
by
association
with
another
poet
whose
nature
was
utterly
dissimilar
to
his
own
yet
who
in
the
poem
he
wrote
at
that
time
gave
tokens
that
he
shared
for
a
period
the
more
abstract
and
etherealised
inspiration
of
shelley
the
saddest
events
awaited
his
return
to
england
but
such
was
his
fear
to
wound
the
feelings
of
others
that
he
never
expressed
the
anguish
he
felt
and
seldom
gave
vent
to
the
indignation
roused
by
the
persecutions
he
underwent
while
the
course
of
deep
unexpressed
passion
and
the
sense
of
injury
engendered
the
desire
to
embody
themselves
in
forms
defecated
of
all
the
weakness
and
evil
which
cling
to
real
life
he
chose
therefore
for
his
hero
a
youth
nourished
in
dreams
of
liberty
some
of
whose
actions
are
in
direct
opposition
to
the
opinions
of
the
world
but
who
is
animated
throughout
by
an
ardent
love
of
virtue
and
a
resolution
to
confer
the
boons
of
political
and
intellectual
freedom
on
his
he
created
for
this
youth
a
woman
such
as
he
delighted
to
imagine
full
of
enthusiasm
for
the
same
objects
and
they
both
with
will
unvanquished
and
the
deepest
sense
of
the
justice
of
their
cause
met
adversity
and
death
there
exists
in
this
poem
a
memorial
of
a
friend
of
his
youth
the
character
of
the
old
man
who
liberates
laon
from
his
tower
prison
and
tends
on
him
in
sickness
is
founded
on
that
of
doctor
lind
who
when
shelley
was
at
eton
had
often
stood
by
to
befriend
and
support
him
and
whose
name
he
never
mentioned
without
love
and
veneration
during
the
year
we
were
established
at
marlow
in
buckinghamshire
shelley
choice
of
abode
was
fixed
chiefly
by
this
town
being
at
no
great
distance
from
london
and
its
neighbourhood
to
the
thames
the
poem
was
written
in
his
boat
as
it
floated
under
the
beech
groves
of
bisham
or
during
wanderings
in
the
neighbouring
country
which
is
distinguished
for
peculiar
beauty
the
chalk
hills
break
into
cliffs
that
overhang
the
thames
or
form
valleys
clothed
with
beech
the
wilder
portion
of
the
country
is
rendered
beautiful
by
exuberant
vegetation
and
the
cultivated
part
is
peculiarly
fertile
with
all
this
wealth
of
nature
which
either
in
the
form
of
gentlemen
parks
or
soil
dedicated
to
agriculture
flourishes
around
marlow
was
inhabited
i
hope
it
is
altered
now
by
a
very
poor
population
the
women
are
lacemakers
and
lose
their
health
by
sedentary
labour
for
which
they
were
very
ill
paid
the
ground
to
the
dust
not
only
the
paupers
but
those
who
had
risen
just
above
that
state
and
were
obliged
to
pay
the
changes
produced
by
peace
following
a
long
war
and
a
bad
harvest
brought
with
them
the
most
evils
to
the
poor
shelley
afforded
what
alleviation
he
could
in
the
winter
while
bringing
out
his
poem
he
had
a
severe
attack
of
ophthalmia
caught
while
visiting
the
poor
cottages
i
mention
these
things
for
this
minute
and
active
sympathy
with
his
gives
a
thousandfold
interest
to
his
speculations
and
stamps
with
reality
his
pleadings
for
the
human
race
the
poem
bold
in
its
opinions
and
uncompromising
in
their
expression
met
with
many
censurers
not
only
among
those
who
allow
of
no
virtue
but
such
as
supports
the
cause
they
espouse
but
even
among
those
whose
opinions
were
similar
to
his
own
i
extract
a
portion
of
a
letter
written
in
answer
to
one
of
these
friends
it
best
details
the
impulses
of
shelley
mind
and
his
motives
it
was
written
with
entire
unreserve
and
is
therefore
a
precious
monument
of
his
own
opinion
of
his
powers
of
the
purity
of
his
designs
and
the
ardour
with
which
he
clung
in
adversity
and
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
to
views
from
which
he
believed
the
permanent
happiness
of
mankind
must
eventually
spring
december
have
read
and
considered
all
that
you
say
about
my
general
powers
and
the
particular
instance
of
the
poem
in
which
i
have
attempted
to
develop
them
nothing
can
be
more
satisfactory
to
me
than
the
interest
which
your
admonitions
express
but
i
think
you
are
mistaken
in
some
points
with
regard
to
the
peculiar
nature
of
my
powers
whatever
be
their
amount
i
listened
with
deference
and
to
your
censures
of
the
revolt
of
islam
but
the
productions
of
mine
which
you
commend
hold
a
very
low
place
in
my
own
esteem
and
this
reassures
me
in
some
degree
at
least
the
poem
was
produced
by
a
series
of
thoughts
which
filled
my
mind
with
unbounded
and
sustained
enthusiasm
i
felt
the
precariousness
of
my
life
and
i
engaged
in
this
task
resolved
to
leave
some
record
of
myself
much
of
what
the
volume
contains
was
written
with
the
same
feeling
as
real
though
not
so
prophetic
as
the
communications
of
a
dying
man
i
never
presumed
indeed
to
consider
it
anything
approaching
to
faultless
but
when
i
consider
contemporary
productions
of
the
same
apparent
pretensions
i
own
i
was
filled
with
confidence
i
felt
that
it
was
in
many
respects
a
genuine
picture
of
my
own
mind
i
felt
that
the
sentiments
were
true
not
assumed
and
in
this
have
i
long
believed
that
my
power
consists
in
sympathy
and
that
part
of
the
imagination
which
relates
to
sentiment
and
contemplation
i
am
formed
if
for
anything
not
in
common
with
the
herd
of
mankind
to
apprehend
minute
and
remote
distinctions
of
feeling
whether
relative
to
external
nature
or
the
living
beings
which
surround
us
and
to
communicate
the
conceptions
which
result
from
considering
either
the
moral
or
the
material
universe
as
a
whole
of
course
i
believe
these
faculties
which
perhaps
comprehend
all
that
is
sublime
in
man
to
exist
very
imperfectly
in
my
own
mind
but
when
you
advert
to
my
a
cold
forced
unimpassioned
insignificant
piece
of
cramped
and
cautious
argument
and
to
the
little
scrap
about
mandeville
which
expressed
my
feelings
indeed
but
cost
scarcely
two
minutes
thought
to
express
as
specimens
of
my
powers
more
favourable
than
that
which
grew
as
it
were
from
the
agony
and
bloody
sweat
of
intellectual
travail
surely
i
must
feel
that
in
some
manner
either
i
am
mistaken
in
believing
that
i
have
any
talent
at
all
or
you
in
the
selection
of
the
specimens
of
it
yet
after
all
i
can
not
but
be
conscious
in
much
of
what
i
write
of
an
absence
of
that
tranquillity
which
is
the
attribute
and
accompaniment
of
power
this
feeling
alone
would
make
your
most
kind
and
wise
admonitions
on
the
subject
of
the
economy
of
intellectual
force
valuable
to
me
and
if
i
live
or
if
i
see
any
trust
in
coming
years
doubt
not
but
that
i
shall
do
something
whatever
it
may
be
which
a
serious
and
earnest
estimate
of
my
powers
will
suggest
to
me
and
which
will
be
in
every
respect
accommodated
to

meets
in
the
ship
in
which
he
is
embarked
a
lady
who
appears
to
him
to
embody
his
ideal
of
love
and
beauty
but
she
proves
to
be
pandemos
or
the
earthly
and
unworthy

who
after
disappointing
his
cherished
dreams
and
hopes
deserts
him

part
there
was
a
youth
who
as
with
toil
and
travel
had
grown
quite
weak
and
gray
before
his
time
nor
any
could
the
restless
griefs
unravel
which
burned
within
him
withering
up
his
prime
and
goading
him
like
fiends
from
land
to
land
not
his
the
load
of
any
secret
crime
for
nought
of
ill
his
heart
could
understand
but
pity
and
wild
sorrow
for
the
same
not
his
the
thirst
for
glory
or
command
baffled
with
blast
of
shame
nor
evil
joys
which
fire
the
vulgar
breast
and
quench
in
speedy
smoke
its
feeble
flame
had
left
within
his
soul
their
dark
unrest
nor
what
religion
fables
of
the
grave
feared

none

he
a
purer
heart
could
have
or
that
loved

more
for
itself
alone
of
nought
in
heaven
or
earth
was
he
the
slave
what
sorrow
strange
and
shadowy
and
unknown
sent
him
a
hopeless
wanderer
through
mankind
if
with
a
human
sadness
he
did
groan
he
had
a
gentle
yet
aspiring
mind
just
innocent
with
varied
learning
fed
and
such
a
glorious
consolation
find
in
others
joy
when
all
their
own
is
dead
he
loved
and
laboured
for
his
kind
in
grief
and
yet
unlike
all
others
it
is
said
that
from
such
toil
he
never
found
relief
although
a
child
of
fortune
and
of
power
of
an
ancestral
name
the
orphan
chief
his
soul
had
wedded
wisdom
and
her
dower
is
love
and
justice
clothed
in
which
he
sate
apart
from
men
as
in
a
lonely
tower
pitying
the
tumult
of
their
dark
yet
even
in
youth
did
he
not
abuse
the
strength
of
wealth
or
thought
to
consecrate
those
false
opinions
which
the
harsh
rich
use
to
blind
the
world
they
famish
for
their
pride
nor
did
he
hold
from
any
man
his
dues
but
like
a
steward
in
honest
dealings
tried
with
those
who
toiled
and
wept
the
poor
and
wise
his
riches
and
his
cares
he
did
divide
fearless
he
was
and
scorning
all
disguise
what
he
dared
do
or
think
though
men
might
start
he
spoke
with
mild
yet
unaverted
eyes
liberal
he
was
of
soul
and
frank
of
heart
and
to
his
many
friends
all
loved
him
well

knew
or
felt
he
would
impart
if
words
he
found
those
inmost
thoughts
to
tell
if
not
he
smiled
or
wept
and
his
weak
foes
he
neither
spurned
nor
hated
though
with
fell
and
mortal
hate
their
thousand
voices
rose
they
passed
like
aimless
arrows
from
his
ear
nor
did
his
heart
or
mind
its
portal
close
to
those
or
them
or
any
whom
life
sphere
may
comprehend
within
its
wide
array
what
sadness
made
that
vernal
spirit
sere
he
knew
not
though
his
life
day
after
day
was
failing
like
an
unreplenished
stream
though
in
his
eyes
a
cloud
and
burthen
lay
through
which
his
soul
like
vesper
serene
beam
piercing
the
chasms
of
ever
rising
clouds
shone
softly
burning
though
his
lips
did
seem
like
reeds
which
quiver
in
impetuous
floods
and
through
his
sleep
and
each
waking
hour
thoughts
after
thoughts
unresting
multitudes
were
driven
within
him
by
some
secret
power
which
bade
them
blaze
and
live
and
roll
afar
like
lights
and
sounds
from
haunted
tower
to
tower
castled
mountains
borne
when
tempest
war
is
levied
by
the
winds
and
the
pale
dalesmen
watch
with
eager
ear
though
such
were
in
his
spirit
as
the
fiends
which
wake
and
feed
an
everliving
woe
what
was
this
grief
which
in
other
minds
a
mirror
found
he
knew
not
none
could
know
but
on
might
question
him
he
turned
the
light
of
his
frank
eyes
as
if
to
show
he
knew
not
of
the
grief
within
that
burned
but
asked
forbearance
with
a
mournful
look
or
spoke
in
words
from
which
none
ever
learned
the
cause
of
his
disquietude
or
shook
with
spasms
of
silent
passion
or
turned
pale
so
that
his
friends
soon
rarely
undertook
to
stir
his
secret
pain
without
avail
for
all
who
knew
and
loved
him
then
perceived
that
there
was
drawn
an
adamantine
veil
between
his
heart
and
mind
both
unrelieved
wrought
in
his
brain
and
bosom
separate
strife
some
said
that
he
was
mad
others
believed
that
memories
of
an
antenatal
life
made
this
where
now
he
dwelt
a
penal
hell
and
others
said
that
such
mysterious
grief
from
god
displeasure
like
a
darkness
fell
on
souls
like
his
which
owned
no
higher
law
than
love
love
calm
steadfast
invincible
by
mortal
fear
or
supernatural
awe
and
others
the
shadow
of
a
dream
which
the
veiled
eye
of
memory
never
saw
through
the
soul
abyss
like
some
dark
stream
through
shattered
mines
and
caverns
underground
rolls
shaking
its
foundations
and
no
beam
joy
may
rise
but
it
is
quenched
and
drowned
in
the
dim
whirlpools
of
this
dream
obscure
soon
its
exhausted
waters
will
have

they

babbling
vain
words
and
fond
philosophy

was
their
consolation
such
debate
men
held
with
one
another

did
he
like
one
who
labours
with
a
human
woe
decline
this
talk

if
its
theme
might
be
another
not
himself

fro

canvassed
it
with
subtlest
wit

none
but
those
who
loved
him

could
know
that
which
he
knew
not
how
it
galled
and
bit
his
weary
mind
this
converse
vain
and
cold
for
like
an
eyeless
nightmare

did
sit
upon
his
being
a
snake

fold
by
fold
pressed
out
the
life

a
clinging

clenched
him

would
hang

blend
with
his

arrowy
light
shone
like
the
reflex
of
a
thousand

was
the
last
whom
superstition

spared
in
greece
the
blight
that
cramps
and
blinds

in
his
olive
bower
at

island

mariner

fell
in

with

the
story
of
rosalind
and
helen
is
undoubtedly
not
an
attempt
in
the
highest
style
of
poetry
it
is
in
no
degree
calculated
to
excite
profound
meditation
and
if
by
interesting
the
affections
and
amusing
the
imagination
it
awakens
a
certain
ideal
melancholy
favourable
to
the
reception
of
more
important
impressions
it
will
produce
in
the
reader
all
that
the
writer
experienced
in
the
composition
i
resigned
myself
as
i
wrote
to
the
impulses
of
the
feelings
which
moulded
the
conception
of
the
story
and
this
impulse
determined
the
pauses
of
a
measure
which
only
pretends
to
be
regular
inasmuch
as
it
corresponds
with
and
expresses
the
irregularity
of
the
imaginations
which
inspired
it
i
do
not
know
which
of
the
few
scattered
poems
i
left
in
england
will
be
selected
by
my
bookseller
to
add
to
this
collection
one
lines
written
among
the
euganean
hills
editor
which
i
sent
from
italy
was
written
after
a
day
excursion
among
those
lovely
mountains
which
surround
what
was
once
the
retreat
and
where
is
now
the
sepulchre
of
petrarch
if
any
one
is
inclined
to
condemn
the
insertion
of
the
introductory
lines
which
image
forth
the
sudden
relief
of
a
state
of
deep
despondency
by
the
radiant
visions
disclosed
by
the
sudden
burst
of
an
italian
sunrise
in
autumn
on
the
highest
peak
of
those
delightful
mountains
i
can
only
offer
as
my
excuse
that
they
were
not
erased
at
the
request
of
a
dear
friend
with
whom
added
years
of
intercourse
only
add
to
my
apprehension
of
its
value
and
who
would
have
had
more
right
than
any
one
to
complain
that
she
has
not
been
able
to
extinguish
in
me
the
very
power
of

helen
come
hither
my
sweet
rosalind
is
long
since
thou
and
i
have
met
and
yet
methinks
it
were
unkind
those
moments
to
forget
come
sit
by
me
i
see
thee
stand
by
this
lone
lake
in
this
far
land
thy
loose
hair
in
the
light
wind
flying
thy
sweet
voice
to
each
tone
of
even
united
and
thine
eyes
replying
to
the
hues
of
yon
fair
heaven
come
gentle
friend
wilt
sit
by
me
and
be
as
thou
wert
wont
to
be
ere
we
were
disunited
none
doth
behold
us
now
the
power
that
led
us
forth
at
this
lone
hour
will
be
but
ill
requited
if
thou
depart
in
scorn
oh
come
and
talk
of
our
abandoned
home
remember
this
is
italy
and
we
are
exiles
talk
with
me
of
that
our
land
whose
wilds
and
floods
barren
and
dark
although
they
be
were
dearer
than
these
chestnut
woods
those
heathy
paths
that
inland
stream
and
the
blue
mountains
shapes
which
seem
like
wrecks
of
childhood
sunny
dream
which
that
we
have
abandoned
now
weighs
on
the
heart
like
that
remorse
which
altered
friendship
leaves
i
seek
no
more
our
youthful
intercourse
that
can
not
be

speak
speak
to
me
leave
me
when
morn
did
come
when
evening
fell
upon
our
common
home
when
for
one
hour
we
parted
do
not
frown
i
would
not
chide
thee
though
thy
faith
is
broken
but
turn
to
me
oh
by
this
cherished
token
of
woven
hair
which
thou
wilt
not
disown
turn
as
but
the
memory
of
me
and
not
my
scorned
self
who
prayed
to
thee
rosalind
is
it
a
dream
or
do
i
see
and
hear
frail
helen
i
would
flee
thy
tainting
touch
but
former
years
arise
and
bring
forbidden
tears
and
my
memory
seeks
yet
its
lost
repose
in
thee
i
share
thy
crime
i
can
not
choose
but
weep
for
thee
mine
own
strange
grief
but
seldom
stoops
to
such
relief
nor
ever
did
i
love
thee
less
though
mourning
thy
wickedness
even
with
a
sister
woe
i
knew
what
to
the
evil
world
is
due
and
therefore
sternly
did
refuse
to
link
me
with
the
infamy
of
one
so
lost
as
helen
now
bewildered
by
my
dire
despair
wondering
i
blush
and
weep
that
thou
love
me
still
thou
only
there
let
us
sit
on
that
gray
stone
till
our
mournful
talk
be
done
helen
alas
not
there
i
can
not
bear
the
murmur
of
this
lake
to
hear
a
sound
from
there
rosalind
dear
which
never
yet
i
heard
elsewhere
but
in
our
native
land
recurs
even
here
where
now
we
meet
it
stirs
too
much
of
suffocating
sorrow
in
the
dell
of
yon
dark
chestnutwood
is
a
stone
seat
a
solitude
less
like
our
own
the
ghost
of
peace
will
not
desert
this
spot
if
thy
kind
feelings
should
not
cease
we
may
sit
here
rosalind
thou
lead
my
sweet
and
i
will
follow
henry

seat
where
you
are
going

is

trees

close

the
little
river
helen
yes
i
know
i
was
bewildered
kiss
me
and
be
gay
dear
boy
why
do
you
sob
henry
i
do
not
know
but
it
might
break
any
one
heart
to
see
you
and
the
lady
cry
so
bitterly
helen
it
is
a
gentle
child
my
friend
go
home
henry
and
play
with
lilla
till
i
come
we
only
cried
with
joy
to
see
each
other
we
are
quite
merry
now
the
boy
lifted
a
sudden
look
upon
his
mother
and
in
the
gleam
of
forced
and
hollow
joy
which
lightened
her
face
laughed
with
the
glee
of
light
and
unsuspecting
infancy
and
whispered
in
her
ear
home
with
you
that
sweet
strange
then
off
he
flew
but
stopped
and
beckoned
with
a
meaning
smile
where
the
road
turned
pale
rosalind
the
while
hiding
her
face
stood
weeping
silently
in
silence
then
they
took
the
way
beneath
the
forest
solitude
it
was
a
vast
and
antique
wood
thro
which
they
took
their
way
and
the
gray
shades
of
evening
that
green
wilderness
did
fling
still
deeper
solitude
pursuing
still
the
path
that
wound
the
vast
and
knotted
trees
around
through
which
slow
shades
were
wandering
to
a
deep
lawny
dell
they
came
to
a
stone
seat
beside
a
spring
which
the
columned
wood
did
frame
a
roofless
temple
like
the
fane
where
ere
new
creeds
could
faith
obtain
man
early
race
once
knelt
beneath
the
overhanging
deity
this
fair
fountain
hung
the
sky
now
spangled
with
rare
stars
the
snake
the
pale
snake
that
with
eager
breath
creeps
here
his
noontide
thirst
to
slake
is
beaming
with
many
a
mingled
hue
shed
from
yon
dome
eternal
blue
when
he
floats
on
that
dark
and
lucid
flood
in
the
light
of
his
own
loveliness
and
the
birds
that
in
the
fountain
dip
their
plumes
with
fearless
fellowship
above
and
round
him
wheel
and
hover
the
fitful
wind
is
heard
to
stir
one
solitary
leaf
on
high
the
chirping
of
the
grasshopper
fills
every
pause
there
is
emotion
in
all
that
dwells
at
noontide
here
then
through
the
intricate
wild
wood
a
maze
of
life
and
light
and
motion
is
woven
but
there
is
stillness
now
gloom
and
the
trance
of
nature
now
the
snake
is
in
his
cave
asleep
the
birds
are
on
the
branches
dreaming
only
the
shadows
creep
only
the
is
gleaming
only
the
owls
and
the
nightingales
wake
in
this
dell
when
daylight
fails
and
gray
shades
gather
in
the
woods
and
the
owls
have
all
fled
far
away
in
a
merrier
glen
to
hoot
and
play
for
the
moon
is
veiled
and
sleeping
now
the
accustomed
nightingale
still
broods
on
her
accustomed
bough
but
she
is
mute
for
her
false
mate
has
fled
and
left
her
desolate
this
silent
spot
tradition
old
had
peopled
with
the
spectral
dead
for
the
roots
of
the
speaker
hair
felt
cold
and
stiff
as
with
tremulous
lips
he
told
that
a
hellish
shape
at
midnight
led
the
ghost
of
a
youth
with
hoary
hair
and
sate
on
the
seat
beside
him
there
till
a
naked
child
came
wandering
by
when
the
fiend
would
change
to
a
lady
fair
a
fearful
tale
the
truth
was
worse
for
here
a
sister
and
a
brother
had
solemnized
a
monstrous
curse
meeting
in
this
fair
solitude
for
beneath
yon
very
sky
had
they
resigned
to
one
another
body
and
soul
the
multitude
tracking
them
to
the
secret
wood
tore
limb
from
limb
their
innocent
child
and
stabbed
and
trampled
on
its
mother
but
the
youth
for
god
most
holy
grace
a
priest
saved
to
burn
in
the
duly
at
evening
helen
came
to
this
lone
silent
spot
from
the
wrecks
of
a
tale
of
wilder
sorrow
so
much
of
sympathy
to
borrow
as
soothed
her
own
dark
lot
duly
each
evening
from
her
home
with
her
fair
child
would
helen
come
to
sit
upon
that
antique
seat
while
the
hues
of
day
were
pale
and
the
bright
boy
beside
her
feet
now
lay
lifting
at
intervals
his
broad
blue
eyes
on
her
now
where
some
sudden
impulse
calls
following
he
was
a
gentle
boy
and
in
all
gentle
sorts
took
joy
oft
in
a
dry
leaf
for
a
boat
with
a
small
feather
for
a
sail
his
fancy
on
that
spring
would
float
if
some
invisible
breeze
might
stir
its
marble
calm
and
helen
smiled
through
tears
of
awe
on
the
gay
child
to
think
that
a
boy
as
fair
as
he
in
years
which
never
more
may
be
by
that
same
fount
in
that
same
wood
the
like
sweet
fancies
had
pursued
and
that
a
mother
lost
like
her
had
mournfully
sate
watching
him
then
all
the
scene
was
wont
to
swim
through
the
mist
of
a
burning
tear
for
many
months
had
helen
known
this
scene
and
now
she
thither
turned
her
footsteps
not
alone
the
friend
whose
falsehood
she
had
mourned
sate
with
her
on
that
seat
of
stone
silent
they
sate
for
evening
and
the
power
its
glimpses
bring
had
with
one
awful
shadow
quelled
the
passion
of
their
grief
they
sate
with
linked
hands
for
unrepelled
had
helen
taken
rosalind
like
the
autumn
wind
when
it
unbinds
the
tangled
locks
of
the
nightshade
hair
which
is
twined
in
the
sultry
summer
air
round
the
walls
of
an
outworn
sepulchre
did
the
voice
of
helen
sad
and
sweet
and
the
sound
of
her
heart
that
ever
beat
as
with
sighs
and
words
she
breathed
on
her
unbind
the
knots
of
her
friend
despair
till
her
thoughts
were
free
to
float
and
flow
and
from
her
labouring
bosom
now
like
the
bursting
of
a
prisoned
flame
the
voice
of
a
long
pent
sorrow
came
rosalind
i
saw
the
dark
earth
fall
upon
the
coffin
and
i
saw
the
stone
laid
over
him
whom
this
cold
breast
had
pillowed
to
his
nightly
rest
thou
knowest
not
thou
canst
not
know
my
agony
oh
i
could
not
weep
the
sources
whence
such
blessings
flow
were
not
to
be
approached
by
me
but
i
could
smile
and
i
could
sleep
though
with
a
heart
in
morning
light
in
evening
gloom
i
watched
and
would
not
thence
depart
my
husband
unlamented
tomb
my
children
knew
their
sire
was
gone
but
when
i
told
them
is
dead
they
laughed
aloud
in
frantic
glee
they
clapped
their
hands
and
leaped
about
answering
each
other
ecstasy
with
many
a
prank
and
merry
shout
but
i
sate
silent
and
alone
wrapped
in
the
mock
of
mourning
weed
they
laughed
for
he
was
dead
but
i
sate
with
a
hard
and
tearless
eye
and
with
a
heart
which
would
deny
the
secret
joy
it
could
not
quell
low
muttering
his
loathed
name
till
from
that
came
remorse
where
sin
was
none
a
hell
which
in
pure
spirits
should
not
dwell
i
tell
thee
truth
he
was
a
man
hard
selfish
loving
only
gold
yet
full
of
guile
his
pale
eyes
ran
with
tears
which
each
some
falsehood
told
and
oft
his
smooth
and
bridled
tongue
would
give
the
lie
to
his
flushing
cheek
he
was
a
coward
to
the
strong
he
was
a
tyrant
to
the
weak
on
whom
his
vengeance
he
would
wreak
for
scorn
whose
arrows
search
the
heart
from
many
a
stranger
eye
would
dart
and
on
his
memory
cling
and
follow
his
soul
to
its
home
so
cold
and
hollow
he
was
a
tyrant
to
the
weak
and
we
were
such
alas
the
day
oft
when
my
little
ones
at
play
were
in
youth
natural
lightness
gay
or
if
they
listened
to
some
tale
of
travellers
or
of
fairy
land
when
the
light
from
the
dying
brand
flashed
on
their
faces
if
they
heard
or
thought
they
heard
upon
the
stair
his
footstep
the
suspended
word
died
on
my
lips
we
all
grew
pale
the
babe
at
my
bosom
was
hushed
with
fear
if
it
thought
it
heard
its
father
near
and
my
two
wild
boys
would
near
my
knee
cling
cowed
and
cowering
fearfully
i
tell
thee
truth
i
loved
another
his
name
in
my
ear
was
ever
ringing
his
form
to
my
brain
was
ever
clinging
yet
if
some
stranger
breathed
that
name
my
lips
turned
white
and
my
heart
beat
fast
my
nights
were
once
haunted
by
dreams
of
flame
my
days
were
dim
in
the
shadow
cast
by
the
memory
of
the
same
day
and
night
day
and
night
he
was
my
breath
and
life
and
light
for
three
short
years
which
soon
were
passed
on
the
fourth
my
gentle
mother
led
me
to
the
shrine
to
be
his
sworn
bride
eternally
and
now
we
stood
on
the
altar
stair
when
my
father
came
from
a
distant
land
and
with
a
loud
and
fearful
cry
rushed
between
us
suddenly
i
saw
the
stream
of
his
thin
gray
hair
i
saw
his
lean
and
lifted
hand
and
heard
his
words
and
live
oh
god
wherefore
do
i
live
hold
he
cried
tell
thee
is
her
brother
thy
mother
boy
beneath
the
sod
of
yon
churchyard
rests
in
her
shroud
so
cold
i
am
now
weak
and
pale
and
old
we
were
once
dear
to
one
another
i
and
that
corpse
thou
art
our
child
then
with
a
laugh
both
long
and
wild
the
youth
upon
the
pavement
fell
they
found
him
dead
all
looked
on
me
the
spasms
of
my
despair
to
see
but
i
was
calm
i
went
away
i
was
like
clay
i
did
not
weep
i
did
not
speak
but
day
by
day
week
after
week
i
walked
about
like
a
corpse
alive
alas
sweet
friend
you
must
believe
this
heart
is
stone
it
did
not
break
my
father
lived
a
little
while
but
all
might
see
that
he
was
dying
he
smiled
with
such
a
woeful
smile
when
he
was
in
the
churchyard
lying
among
the
worms
we
grew
quite
poor
so
that
no
one
would
give
us
bread
my
mother
looked
at
me
and
said
faint
words
of
cheer
which
only
meant
that
she
could
die
and
be
content
so
i
went
forth
from
the
same
church
door
to
another
husband
bed
and
this
was
he
who
died
at
last
when
weeks
and
months
and
years
had
passed
through
which
i
firmly
did
fulfil
my
duties
a
devoted
wife
with
the
stern
step
of
vanquished
will
walking
beneath
the
night
of
life
whose
hours
extinguished
like
slow
rain
falling
for
ever
pain
by
pain
the
very
hope
of
death
dear
rest
which
since
the
heart
within
my
breast
of
natural
life
was
dispossessed
its
strange
sustainer
there
had
been
when
flowers
were
dead
and
grass
was
green
upon
my
mother
grave
that
mother
whom
to
outlive
and
cheer
and
make
my
wan
eyes
glitter
for
her
sake
was
my
vowed
task
the
single
care
which
once
gave
life
to
my
despair
when
she
was
a
thing
that
did
not
stir
and
the
crawling
worms
were
cradling
her
to
a
sleep
more
deep
and
so
more
sweet
than
a
baby
rocked
on
its
nurse
knee
i
lived
a
living
pulse
then
beat
beneath
my
heart
that
awakened
me
what
was
this
pulse
so
warm
and
free
alas
i
knew
it
could
not
be
my
own
dull
blood
was
like
a
thought
of
liquid
love
that
spread
and
wrought
under
my
bosom
and
in
my
brain
and
crept
with
the
blood
through
every
vein
and
hour
by
hour
day
after
day
the
wonder
could
not
charm
away
but
laid
in
sleep
my
wakeful
pain
until
i
knew
it
was
a
child
and
then
i
wept
for
long
long
years
these
frozen
eyes
had
shed
no
tears
but
now
was
the
season
fair
and
mild
when
april
has
wept
itself
to
may
i
sate
through
the
sweet
sunny
day
by
my
window
bowered
round
with
leaves
and
down
my
cheeks
the
quick
tears
fell
like
twinkling
from
the
eaves
when
warm
spring
showers
are
passing
o
helen
none
can
ever
tell
the
joy
it
was
to
weep
once
more
i
wept
to
think
how
hard
it
were
to
kill
my
babe
and
take
from
it
the
sense
of
light
and
the
warm
air
and
my
own
fond
and
tender
care
and
love
and
smiles
ere
i
knew
yet
that
these
for
it
might
as
for
me
be
the
masks
of
a
grinning
mockery
and
haply
i
would
dream
sweet
to
feed
it
from
my
faded
breast
or
mark
my
own
heart
restless
beat
rock
it
to
its
untroubled
rest
and
watch
the
growing
soul
beneath
dawn
in
faint
smiles
and
hear
its
breath
half
interrupted
by
calm
sighs
and
search
the
depth
of
its
fair
eyes
for
long
departed
memories
and
so
i
lived
till
that
sweet
load
was
lightened
darkly
forward
flowed
the
stream
of
years
and
on
it
bore
two
shapes
of
gladness
to
my
sight
two
other
babes
delightful
more
in
my
lost
soul
abandoned
night
than
their
own
country
ships
may
be
sailing
towards
wrecked
mariners
who
cling
to
the
rock
of
a
wintry
sea
for
each
as
it
came
brought
soothing
tears
and
a
loosening
warmth
as
each
one
lay
sucking
the
sullen
milk
away
about
my
frozen
heart
did
play
and
weaned
it
oh
how
painfully
as
they
themselves
were
weaned
each
one
from
that
sweet
food
even
from
the
thirst
of
death
and
nothingness
and
rest
strange
inmate
of
a
living
breast
which
all
that
i
had
undergone
of
grief
and
shame
since
she
who
first
the
gates
of
that
dark
refuge
closed
came
to
my
sight
and
almost
burst
the
seal
of
that
lethean
spring
but
these
fair
shadows
interposed
for
all
delights
are
shadows
now
and
from
my
brain
to
my
dull
brow
the
heavy
tears
gather
and
flow
i
can
not
speak
oh
let
me
weep
the
tears
which
fell
from
her
wan
eyes
glimmered
among
the
moonlight
dew
her
deep
hard
sobs
and
heavy
sighs
their
echoes
in
the
darkness
threw
when
she
grew
calm
she
thus
did
keep
the
tenor
of
her
tale
he
died
i
know
not
how
he
was
not
old
if
age
be
numbered
by
its
years
but
he
was
bowed
and
bent
with
fears
pale
with
the
quenchless
thirst
of
gold
which
like
fierce
fever
left
him
weak
and
his
strait
lip
and
bloated
cheek
were
warped
in
spasms
by
hollow
sneers
and
selfish
cares
with
barren
plough
not
age
had
lined
his
narrow
brow
and
foul
and
cruel
thoughts
which
feed
upon
the
withering
life
within
like
vipers
on
some
poisonous
weed
whether
his
ill
were
death
or
sin
none
knew
until
he
died
indeed
and
then
men
owned
they
were
the
same
seven
days
within
my
chamber
lay
that
corse
and
my
babes
made
holiday
at
last
i
told
them
what
is
death
the
eldest
with
a
kind
of
shame
came
to
my
knees
with
silent
breath
and
sate
at
my
feet
and
soon
the
others
left
their
play
and
sate
there
too
it
is
unmeet
to
shed
on
the
brief
flower
of
youth
the
withering
knowledge
of
the
grave
from
me
remorse
then
wrung
that
truth
i
could
not
bear
the
joy
which
gave
too
just
a
response
to
mine
own
in
vain
i
dared
not
feign
a
groan
and
in
their
artless
looks
i
saw
between
the
mists
of
fear
and
awe
that
my
own
thought
was
theirs
and
they
expressed
it
not
in
words
but
said
each
in
its
heart
how
every
day
will
pass
in
happy
work
and
play
now
he
is
dead
and
gone
away
after
the
funeral
all
our
kin
assembled
and
the
will
was
read
my
friend
i
tell
thee
even
the
dead
have
strength
their
putrid
shrouds
within
to
blast
and
torture
those
who
live
still
fear
the
living
but
a
corse
is
merciless
and
power
doth
give
to
such
pale
tyrants
half
the
spoil
he
rends
from
those
who
groan
and
toil
because
they
blush
not
with
remorse
among
their
crawling
worms
behold
i
have
no
child
my
tale
grows
old
with
grief
and
staggers
let
it
reach
the
limits
of
my
feeble
speech
and
languidly
at
length
recline
on
the
brink
of
its
own
grave
and
mine
thou
knowest
what
a
thing
is
poverty
among
the
fallen
on
evil
days
crime
and
fear
and
infamy
and
houseless
want
in
frozen
ways
wandering
ungarmented
and
pain
and
worse
than
all
that
inward
stain
foul
which
drowns
in
sneers
youth
starlight
smile
and
makes
its
tears
first
like
hot
gall
then
dry
for
ever
and
well
thou
knowest
a
mother
never
could
doom
her
children
to
this
ill
and
well
he
knew
the
same
the
will
imported
that
if
again
i
sought
my
children
to
behold
or
in
my
birthplace
did
remain
beyond
three
days
whose
hours
were
told
they
should
inherit
nought
and
he
to
whom
next
came
their
patrimony
a
sallow
lawyer
cruel
and
cold
aye
watched
me
as
the
will
was
read
with
eyes
askance
which
sought
to
see
the
secrets
of
my
agony
and
with
close
lips
and
anxious
brow
stood
canvassing
still
to
and
fro
the
chance
of
my
resolve
and
all
the
dead
man
caution
just
did
call
for
in
that
killing
lie
was
said
is
adulterous
and
doth
hold
in
secret
that
the
christian
creed
is
false
and
therefore
is
much
need
that
i
should
have
a
care
to
save
my
children
from
eternal
fire
friend
he
was
sheltered
by
the
grave
and
therefore
dared
to
be
a
liar
in
truth
the
indian
on
the
pyre
of
her
dead
husband
half
consumed
as
well
might
there
be
false
as
i
to
those
abhorred
embraces
doomed
far
worse
than
fire
brief
agony
as
to
the
christian
creed
if
true
or
false
i
never
questioned
it
i
took
it
as
the
vulgar
do
nor
my
vexed
soul
had
leisure
yet
to
doubt
the
things
men
say
or
deem
that
they
are
other
than
they
seem
all
present
who
those
crimes
did
hear
in
feigned
or
actual
scorn
and
fear
men
women
children
slunk
away
whispering
with
pride
which
half
suspects
its
own
base
lie
i
spoke
to
none
nor
did
abide
but
silently
i
went
my
way
nor
noticed
i
where
joyously
sate
my
two
younger
babes
at
play
in
the
through
which
i
passed
but
went
with
footsteps
firm
and
fast
till
i
came
to
the
brink
of
the
ocean
green
and
there
a
woman
with
gray
hairs
who
had
my
mother
servant
been
kneeling
with
many
tears
and
prayers
made
me
accept
a
purse
of
gold
half
of
the
earnings
she
had
kept
to
refuge
her
when
weak
and
old
with
woe
which
never
sleeps
or
slept
i
wander
now
is
a
vain
thought
but
on
yon
alp
whose
snowy
head
the
azure
air
is
islanded
we
see
it
the
flood
of
cloud
which
sunrise
from
its
eastern
caves
drives
wrinkling
into
golden
waves
hung
with
its
precipices
proud
from
that
gray
stone
where
first
we
met
there
now
who
knows
the
dead
feel
nought
should
be
my
grave
for
he
who
yet
is
my
soul
soul
once
said
sweet
stars
and
lightnings
to
abide
and
winds
and
lulling
snows
that
beat
with
their
soft
flakes
the
mountain
wide
where
weary
meteor
lamps
repose
and
languid
storms
their
pinions
close
and
all
things
strong
and
bright
and
pure
and
ever
during
aye
endure
who
knows
if
one
were
buried
there
but
these
things
might
our
spirits
make
amid
the
air
their
own
eternity
partake
then
was
a
wild
and
playful
saying
at
which
i
laughed
or
seemed
to
laugh
they
were
his
words
now
heed
my
praying
and
let
them
be
my
epitaph
thy
memory
for
a
term
may
be
my
monument
wilt
remember
me
i
know
thou
wilt
and
canst
forgive
whilst
in
this
erring
world
to
live
my
soul
disdained
not
that
i
thought
its
lying
forms
were
worthy
aught
and
much
less
thee
helen
o
speak
not
so
but
come
to
me
and
pour
thy
woe
into
this
heart
full
though
it
be
ay
overflowing
with
its
own
i
thought
that
grief
had
severed
me
from
all
beside
who
weep
and
groan
its
likeness
upon
earth
to
be
its
express
image
but
thou
art
more
wretched
sweet
we
will
not
part
henceforth
if
death
be
not
division
if
so
the
dead
feel
no
contrition
but
wilt
thou
hear
since
last
we
parted
all
that
has
left
me
broken
hearted
rosalind
yes
speak
the
faintest
stars
are
scarcely
shorn
of
their
thin
beams
by
that
delusive
morn
which
sinks
again
in
darkness
like
the
light
of
early
love
soon
lost
in
total
night
helen
alas
italian
winds
are
mild
but
my
bosom
is
cold
wintry
cold
when
the
warm
air
weaves
among
the
fresh
leaves
soft
music
my
poor
brain
is
wild
and
i
am
weak
like
a
nursling
child
though
my
soul
with
grief
is
gray
and
old
rosalind
weep
not
at
thine
own
words
though
they
must
make
me
weep
what
is
thy
tale
helen
i
fear
shake
thy
gentle
heart
with
tears
thou
well
rememberest
when
we
met
no
more
and
though
i
dwelt
with
lionel
that
friendless
caution
pierced
me
sore
with
grief
a
wound
my
spirit
bore
indignantly
but
when
he
died
with
him
lay
dead
both
hope
and
pride
alas
all
hope
is
buried
now
but
then
men
dreamed
the
aged
earth
was
labouring
in
that
mighty
birth
which
many
a
poet
and
a
sage
has
aye
foreseen
the
happy
age
when
truth
and
love
shall
dwell
below
among
the
works
and
ways
of
men
which
on
this
world
not
power
but
will
even
now
is
wanting
to
fulfil
among
mankind
what
thence
befell
of
strife
how
vain
is
known
too
well
when
liberty
dear
paean
fell
murderous
howls
to
lionel
though
of
great
wealth
and
lineage
high
yet
through
those
dungeon
walls
there
came
thy
thrilling
light
o
liberty
and
as
the
meteor
midnight
flame
startles
the
dreamer
truth
flashed
on
his
visionary
youth
and
filled
him
not
with
love
but
faith
and
hope
and
courage
mute
in
death
for
love
and
life
in
him
were
twins
born
at
one
birth
in
every
other
first
life
then
love
its
course
begins
though
they
be
children
of
one
mother
and
so
through
this
dark
world
they
fleet
divided
till
in
death
they
meet
but
he
loved
all
things
ever
then
he
passed
amid
the
strife
of
men
and
stood
at
the
throne
of
armed
power
pleading
for
a
world
of
woe
secure
as
one
on
a
tower
the
wrecks
which
the
surge
trails
to
and
fro
the
passions
wild
of
human
kind
he
stood
like
a
spirit
calming
them
for
it
was
said
his
words
could
bind
like
music
the
lulled
crowd
and
stem
that
torrent
of
unquiet
dream
which
mortals
truth
and
reason
deem
but
is
revenge
and
fear
and
pride
joyous
he
was
and
hope
and
peace
on
all
who
heard
him
did
abide
raining
like
dew
from
his
sweet
talk
as
where
the
evening
star
may
walk
along
the
brink
of
the
gloomy
seas
liquid
mists
of
splendour
quiver
his
very
gestures
touched
to
tears
the
unpersuaded
tyrant
never
so
moved
before
his
presence
stung
the
torturers
with
their
victim
pain
and
none
knew
how
and
through
their
ears
the
subtle
witchcraft
of
his
tongue
unlocked
the
hearts
of
those
who
keep
gold
the
world
bond
of
slavery
men
wondered
and
some
sneered
to
see
one
sow
what
he
could
never
reap
for
he
is
rich
they
said
and
young
and
might
drink
from
the
depths
of
luxury
if
he
seeks
fame
fame
never
crowned
the
champion
of
a
trampled
creed
if
he
seeks
power
power
is
enthroned
ancient
rights
and
wrongs
to
feed
which
hungry
wolves
with
praise
and
spoil
those
who
would
sit
near
power
must
toil
and
such
there
sitting
all
may
see
what
seeks
he
all
that
others
seek
he
casts
away
like
a
vile
weed
which
the
sea
casts
unreturningly
that
poor
and
hungry
men
should
break
the
laws
which
wreak
them
toil
and
scorn
we
understand
but
lionel
we
know
is
rich
and
nobly
born
so
wondered
they
yet
all
men
loved
young
lionel
though
few
approved
all
but
the
priests
whose
hatred
fell
like
the
unseen
blight
of
a
smiling
day
the
withering
honey
dew
which
clings
under
the
bright
green
buds
of
may
whilst
they
unfold
their
emerald
wings
for
he
made
verses
wild
and
queer
on
the
strange
creeds
priests
hold
so
dear
because
they
bring
them
land
and
gold
of
devils
and
saints
and
all
such
gear
he
made
tales
which
whoso
heard
or
read
would
laugh
till
he
were
almost
dead
so
this
grew
a
proverb
get
old
till
lionel
banquet
in
hell
you
hear
and
then
you
will
laugh
yourself
young
again
so
the
priests
hated
him
and
he
repaid
their
hate
with
cheerful
glee
ah
smiles
and
joyance
quickly
died
for
public
hope
grew
pale
and
dim
in
an
altered
time
and
tide
and
in
its
wasting
withered
him
as
a
summer
flower
that
blows
too
soon
droops
in
the
smile
of
the
waning
moon
when
it
scatters
through
an
april
night
the
frozen
dews
of
wrinkling
blight
none
now
hoped
more
gray
power
was
seated
safely
on
her
ancestral
throne
and
faith
the
python
undefeated
even
to
its
steps
dragged
on
her
foul
and
wounded
train
and
men
were
trampled
and
deceived
again
and
words
and
shows
again
could
bind
the
wailing
tribes
of
human
kind
in
scorn
and
famine
fire
and
blood
raged
round
the
raging
multitude
to
fields
remote
by
tyrants
sent
to
be
the
scorned
instrument
with
which
they
drag
from
mines
of
gore
the
chains
their
slaves
yet
ever
wore
and
in
the
streets
men
met
each
other
and
by
old
altars
and
in
halls
and
smiled
again
at
festivals
but
each
man
found
in
his
heart
brother
cold
cheer
for
all
though
half
deceived
the
outworn
creeds
again
believed
and
the
same
round
anew
began
which
the
weary
world
yet
ever
ran
many
then
wept
not
tears
but
gall
within
their
hearts
like
drops
which
fall
wasting
the
away
and
in
that
dark
and
evil
day
did
all
desires
and
thoughts
that
claim
men
care
ambition
friendship
fame
love
hope
though
hope
was
now
despair
indue
the
colours
of
this
change
as
from
the
air
the
earth
takes
hues
obscure
and
strange
when
storm
and
earthquake
linger
there
and
so
my
friend
it
then
befell
to
many
most
to
lionel
whose
hope
was
like
the
life
of
youth
within
him
and
when
dead
became
a
spirit
of
unresting
flame
which
goaded
him
in
his
distress
over
the
world
vast
wilderness
three
years
he
left
his
native
land
and
on
the
fourth
when
he
returned
none
knew
him
he
was
stricken
deep
with
some
disease
of
mind
and
turned
into
aught
unlike
lionel
on
him
on
whom
did
he
pause
in
sleep
serenest
smiles
were
wont
to
keep
and
did
he
wake
a
winged
band
of
bright
persuasions
which
had
fed
on
his
sweet
lips
and
liquid
eyes
kept
their
swift
pinions
half
outspread
to
do
on
men
his
least
command
on
him
whom
once
was
paradise
even
to
behold
now
misery
lay
in
his
own
heart
was
merciless
to
all
things
else
none
may
express
its
innocence
and
tenderness
said
that
he
had
refuge
sought
in
love
from
his
unquiet
thought
in
distant
lands
and
been
deceived
by
some
strange
show
for
there
were
found
blotted
with
tears
as
those
relieved
by
their
own
words
are
wont
to
do
these
mournful
verses
on
the
ground
by
all
who
read
them
blotted
too
am
i
changed
my
hopes
were
once
like
fire
i
loved
and
i
believed
that
life
was
love
how
am
i
lost
on
wings
of
swift
desire
among
heaven
winds
my
spirit
once
did
move
i
slept
and
silver
dreams
did
aye
inspire
my
liquid
sleep
i
woke
and
did
approve
all
nature
to
my
heart
and
thought
to
make
a
paradise
of
earth
for
one
sweet
sake
love
but
i
believe
in
love
no
more
i
feel
desire
but
hope
not
o
from
sleep
most
vainly
must
my
weary
brain
implore
its
long
lost
flattery
now
i
wake
to
weep
and
sit
through
the
long
day
gnawing
the
core
of
my
bitter
heart
and
like
a
miser
keep
since
none
in
what
i
feel
take
pain
or
pleasure
to
my
own
soul
its
treasure
he
dwelt
beside
me
near
the
sea
and
oft
in
evening
did
we
meet
when
the
waves
beneath
the
starlight
flee
the
yellow
sands
with
silver
feet
and
talked
our
talk
was
sad
and
sweet
till
slowly
from
his
mien
there
passed
the
desolation
which
it
spoke
and
smiles
as
when
the
lightning
blast
has
parched
some
oak
the
next
spring
shows
leaves
pale
and
rare
but
like
flowers
delicate
and
fair
on
its
rent
boughs
again
arrayed
his
countenance
in
tender
light
his
words
grew
subtile
fire
which
made
the
air
his
hearers
breathed
delight
his
motions
like
the
winds
were
free
which
bend
the
bright
grass
gracefully
then
fade
away
in
circlets
faint
and
winged
hope
on
which
upborne
his
soul
seemed
hovering
in
his
eyes
like
some
bright
spirit
newly
born
floating
amid
the
sunny
skies
sprang
forth
from
his
rent
heart
anew
yet
his
talk
and
looks
and
mien
tempering
their
loveliness
too
keen
past
woe
its
shadow
backward
threw
till
like
an
exhalation
spread
from
flowers
half
drunk
with
evening
dew
they
did
become
infectious
sweet
and
subtle
mists
of
sense
and
thought
which
wrapped
us
soon
when
we
might
meet
almost
from
our
own
looks
and
aught
the
wild
world
holds
and
so
his
mind
was
healed
while
mine
grew
sick
with
fear
for
ever
now
his
health
declined
like
some
frail
bark
which
can
not
bear
the
impulse
of
an
altered
wind
though
prosperous
and
my
heart
grew
full
its
new
joy
of
a
new
care
for
his
cheek
became
not
pale
but
fair
as
lilies
are
and
soon
his
deep
and
sunny
hair
in
this
alone
less
beautiful
like
grass
in
tombs
grew
wild
and
rare
the
blood
in
his
translucent
veins
beat
not
like
animal
life
but
love
seemed
now
its
sullen
springs
to
move
when
life
had
failed
and
all
its
pains
and
sudden
sleep
would
seize
him
oft
like
death
so
calm
but
that
a
tear
his
pointed
eyelashes
between
would
gather
in
the
light
serene
of
smiles
whose
lustre
bright
and
soft
beneath
lay
undulating
there
his
breath
was
like
inconstant
flame
as
eagerly
it
went
and
came
and
i
hung
him
in
his
sleep
till
like
an
image
in
the
lake
which
rains
disturb
my
tears
would
break
the
shadow
of
that
slumber
deep
then
he
would
bid
me
not
to
weep
and
say
with
flattery
false
yet
sweet
that
death
and
he
could
never
meet
if
i
would
never
part
with
him
and
so
we
loved
and
did
unite
all
that
in
us
was
yet
divided
for
when
he
said
that
many
a
rite
by
men
to
bind
but
once
provided
could
not
be
shared
by
him
and
me
or
they
would
kill
him
in
their
glee
i
shuddered
and
then
laughing
said
will
have
rites
our
faith
to
bind
but
our
church
shall
be
the
starry
night
our
altar
the
grassy
earth
outspread
and
our
priest
the
muttering
wind
was
sunset
as
i
spoke
one
star
had
scarce
burst
forth
when
from
afar
the
ministers
of
misrule
sent
seized
upon
lionel
and
bore
his
chained
limbs
to
a
dreary
tower
in
the
midst
of
a
city
vast
and
wide
for
he
they
said
from
his
mind
had
bent
against
their
gods
keen
blasphemy
for
which
though
his
soul
must
roasted
be
in
hell
red
lakes
immortally
yet
even
on
earth
must
he
abide
the
vengeance
of
their
slaves
a
trial
i
think
men
call
it
what
avail
are
prayers
and
tears
which
chase
denial
from
the
fierce
savage
nursed
in
hate
what
the
knit
soul
that
pleading
and
pale
makes
wan
the
quivering
cheek
which
late
it
painted
with
its
own
delight
we
were
divided
as
i
could
i
stilled
the
tingling
of
my
blood
and
followed
him
in
their
despite
as
a
widow
follows
pale
and
wild
the
murderers
and
corse
of
her
only
child
and
when
we
came
to
the
prison
door
and
i
prayed
to
share
his
dungeon
floor
with
prayers
which
rarely
have
been
spurned
and
when
men
drove
me
forth
and
i
stared
with
blank
frenzy
on
the
sky
a
farewell
look
of
love
he
turned
half
calming
me
then
gazed
awhile
as
if
thro
that
black
and
massy
pile
and
thro
the
crowd
around
him
there
and
thro
the
dense
and
murky
air
and
the
thronged
streets
he
did
espy
what
poets
know
and
prophesy
and
said
with
voice
that
made
them
shiver
and
clung
like
music
in
my
brain
and
which
the
mute
walls
spoke
again
prolonging
it
with
deepened
strain
not
the
tyrants
shall
rule
for
ever
or
the
priests
of
the
bloody
faith
they
stand
on
the
brink
of
that
mighty
river
whose
waves
they
have
tainted
with
death
it
is
fed
from
the
depths
of
a
thousand
dells
around
them
it
foams
and
rages
and
swells
and
their
swords
and
their
sceptres
i
floating
see
like
wrecks
in
the
surge
of
eternity
i
dwelt
beside
the
prison
gate
and
the
strange
crowd
that
out
and
in
passed
some
no
doubt
with
mine
own
fate
might
have
fretted
me
with
its
ceaseless
din
but
the
fever
of
care
was
louder
within
soon
but
too
late
in
penitence
or
fear
his
foes
released
him
thence
i
saw
his
thin
and
languid
form
as
leaning
on
the
jailor
arm
whose
hardened
eyes
grew
moist
the
while
to
meet
his
mute
and
faded
smile
and
hear
his
words
of
kind
farewell
he
tottered
forth
from
his
damp
cell
many
had
never
wept
before
from
whom
fast
tears
then
gushed
and
fell
many
will
relent
no
more
who
sobbed
like
infants
then
aye
all
who
thronged
the
prison
stony
hall
the
rulers
or
the
slaves
of
law
felt
with
a
new
surprise
and
awe
that
they
were
human
till
strong
shame
made
them
again
become
the
same
the
prison
huge
and
grim
from
human
looks
the
infection
caught
and
fondly
crouched
and
fawned
on
him
and
men
have
heard
the
prisoners
say
who
in
their
rotting
dungeons
lay
that
from
that
hour
throughout
one
day
the
fierce
despair
and
hate
which
kept
their
trampled
bosoms
almost
slept
where
like
twin
vultures
they
hung
feeding
on
each
heart
wound
wide
torn
and
bleeding
because
their
jailors
rule
they
thought
grew
merciful
like
a
parent
sway
i
know
not
how
but
we
were
free
and
lionel
sate
alone
with
me
as
the
carriage
drove
thro
the
streets
apace
and
we
looked
upon
each
other
face
and
the
blood
in
our
fingers
intertwined
ran
like
the
thoughts
of
a
single
mind
as
the
swift
emotions
went
and
came
thro
the
veins
of
each
united
frame
so
thro
the
long
long
streets
we
passed
of
the
city
vast
which
is
that
desert
where
each
one
seeks
his
mate
yet
is
alone
beloved
and
sought
and
mourned
of
none
until
the
clear
blue
sky
was
seen
and
the
grassy
meadows
bright
and
green
and
then
i
sunk
in
his
embrace
enclosing
there
a
mighty
space
of
love
and
so
we
travelled
on
by
woods
and
fields
of
yellow
flowers
and
towns
and
villages
and
towers
day
after
day
of
happy
hours
it
was
the
azure
time
of
june
when
the
skies
are
deep
in
the
stainless
noon
and
the
warm
and
fitful
breezes
shake
the
fresh
green
leaves
of
the
hedgerow
briar
and
there
were
odours
then
to
make
the
very
breath
we
did
respire
a
liquid
element
whereon
our
spirits
like
delighted
things
that
walk
the
air
on
subtle
wings
floated
and
mingled
far
away
the
warm
winds
of
the
sunny
day
and
when
the
evening
star
came
forth
above
the
curve
of
the
new
bent
moon
and
light
and
sound
ebbed
from
the
earth
like
the
tide
of
the
full
and
the
weary
sea
to
the
depths
of
its
own
tranquillity
our
natures
to
its
own
repose
did
the
earth
breathless
sleep
attune
like
flowers
which
on
each
other
close
their
languid
leaves
when
daylight
gone
we
lay
till
new
emotions
came
which
seemed
to
make
each
mortal
frame
one
soul
of
interwoven
flame
a
life
in
life
a
second
birth
in
worlds
diviner
far
than
earth
which
like
two
strains
of
harmony
that
mingle
in
the
silent
sky
then
slowly
disunite
passed
by
and
left
the
tenderness
of
tears
a
soft
oblivion
of
all
fears
a
sweet
sleep
so
we
travelled
on
till
we
came
to
the
home
of
lionel
among
the
mountains
wild
and
lone
beside
the
hoary
western
sea
which
near
the
verge
of
the
echoing
shore
the
massy
forest
shadowed
the
ancient
steward
with
hair
all
hoar
as
we
alighted
wept
to
see
his
master
changed
so
fearfully
and
the
old
man
sobs
did
waken
me
from
my
dream
of
unremaining
gladness
the
truth
flashed
me
like
quick
madness
when
i
looked
and
saw
that
there
was
death
on
lionel
yet
day
by
day
he
lived
till
fear
grew
hope
and
faith
and
in
my
soul
i
dared
to
say
nothing
so
bright
can
pass
away
death
is
dark
and
foul
and
dull
but
he
is
o
how
beautiful
yet
day
by
day
he
grew
more
weak
and
his
sweet
voice
when
he
might
speak
which
was
loud
became
more
low
and
the
light
which
flashed
through
his
waxen
cheek
grew
faint
as
the
hues
which
flow
from
sunset
the
alpine
snow
and
death
seemed
not
like
death
in
him
for
the
spirit
of
life
every
limb
lingered
a
mist
of
sense
and
thought
when
the
summer
wind
faint
odours
brought
from
mountain
flowers
even
as
it
passed
his
cheek
would
change
as
the
noonday
sea
which
the
dying
breeze
sweeps
fitfully
if
but
a
cloud
the
sky
you
might
see
his
colour
come
and
go
and
the
softest
strain
of
music
made
sweet
smiles
yet
sad
arise
and
fade
amid
the
dew
of
his
tender
eyes
and
the
breath
with
intermitting
flow
made
his
pale
lips
quiver
and
part
you
might
hear
the
beatings
of
his
heart
quick
but
not
strong
and
with
my
tresses
when
oft
he
playfully
would
bind
in
the
bowers
of
mossy
lonelinesses
his
neck
and
win
me
so
to
mingle
in
the
sweet
depth
of
woven
caresses
and
our
faint
limbs
were
intertwined
alas
the
unquiet
life
did
tingle
from
mine
own
heart
through
every
vein
like
a
captive
in
dreams
of
liberty
who
beats
the
walls
of
his
stony
cell
but
his
it
seemed
already
free
like
the
shadow
of
fire
surrounding
me
on
my
faint
eyes
and
limbs
did
dwell
that
spirit
as
it
passed
till
soon
as
a
frail
cloud
wandering
the
moon
beneath
its
light
invisible
is
seen
when
it
folds
its
gray
wings
again
to
alight
on
midnight
dusky
plain
i
lived
and
saw
and
the
gathering
soul
passed
from
beneath
that
strong
control
and
i
fell
on
a
life
which
was
sick
with
fear
of
all
the
woe
that
now
i
bear
amid
a
bloomless
myrtle
wood
on
a
green
and
promontory
not
far
from
where
we
dwelt
there
stood
in
record
of
a
sweet
sad
story
an
altar
and
a
temple
bright
circled
by
steps
and
the
gate
was
sculptured
fidelity
and
in
the
shrine
an
image
sate
all
veiled
but
there
was
seen
the
light
of
smiles
which
faintly
could
express
a
mingled
pain
and
tenderness
through
that
ethereal
drapery
the
left
hand
held
the
head
the
right
beyond
the
veil
beneath
the
skin
you
might
see
the
nerves
quivering
within
was
forcing
the
point
of
a
barbed
dart
into
its
heart
an
unskilled
hand
yet
one
informed
with
genius
had
the
marble
warmed
with
that
pathetic
life
this
tale
it
told
a
dog
had
from
the
sea
when
the
tide
was
raging
fearfully
dragged
lionel
mother
weak
and
pale
then
died
beside
her
on
the
sand
and
she
that
temple
thence
had
planned
but
it
was
lionel
own
hand
had
wrought
the
image
each
new
moon
that
lady
did
in
this
lone
fane
the
rites
of
a
religion
sweet
whose
god
was
in
her
heart
and
brain
the
seasons
loveliest
flowers
were
strewn
on
the
marble
floor
beneath
her
feet
and
she
brought
crowns
of
white
whose
odour
is
so
sweet
and
faint
and
weeds
like
branching
chrysolite
woven
in
devices
fine
and
quaint
and
tears
from
her
brown
eyes
did
stain
the
altar
need
but
look
upon
that
dying
statue
fair
and
wan
if
tears
should
cease
to
weep
again
and
rare
arabian
odours
came
through
the
myrtle
copses
steaming
thence
from
the
hissing
frankincense
whose
smoke
as
ocean
foam
hung
in
dense
flocks
beneath
the
dome
that
ivory
dome
whose
azure
night
with
golden
stars
like
heaven
was
bright
the
split
cedar
pointed
flame
and
the
lady
harp
would
kindle
there
the
melody
of
an
old
air
softer
than
sleep
the
villagers
mixed
their
religion
up
with
hers
and
as
they
listened
round
shed
tears
one
eve
he
led
me
to
this
fane
daylight
on
its
last
purple
cloud
was
lingering
gray
and
soon
her
strain
the
nightingale
began
now
loud
climbing
in
circles
the
windless
sky
now
dying
music
suddenly
scattered
in
a
thousand
notes
and
now
to
the
hushed
ear
it
floats
like
field
smells
known
in
infancy
then
failing
soothes
the
air
again
we
sate
within
that
temple
lone
pavilioned
round
with
parian
stone
his
mother
harp
stood
near
and
oft
i
had
awakened
music
soft
amid
its
wires
the
nightingale
was
pausing
in
her
tale
drain
the
cup
said
lionel
the
has
crowned
so
well
with
the
wine
of
her
bright
and
liquid
song
heardst
thou
not
sweet
words
among
that
minstrelsy
thou
not
that
those
who
die
awake
in
a
world
of
ecstasy
that
love
when
limbs
are
interwoven
and
sleep
when
the
night
of
life
is
cloven
and
thought
to
the
world
dim
boundaries
clinging
and
music
when
one
beloved
is
singing
is
death
let
us
drain
right
joyously
the
cup
which
the
sweet
bird
fills
for
me
he
paused
and
to
my
lips
he
bent
his
own
like
spirit
his
words
went
through
all
my
limbs
with
the
speed
of
fire
and
his
keen
eyes
glittering
through
mine
filled
me
with
the
flame
divine
which
in
their
orbs
was
burning
far
like
the
light
of
an
unmeasured
star
in
the
sky
of
midnight
dark
and
deep
yes
was
his
soul
that
did
inspire
sounds
which
my
skill
could
awaken
and
first
i
felt
my
fingers
sweep
the
harp
and
a
long
quivering
cry
burst
from
my
lips
in
symphony
the
dusk
and
solid
air
was
shaken
as
swift
and
swifter
the
notes
came
from
my
touch
that
wandered
like
quick
flame
and
from
my
bosom
labouring
with
some
unutterable
thing
the
awful
sound
of
my
own
voice
made
my
faint
lips
tremble
in
some
mood
of
wordless
thought
lionel
stood
so
pale
that
even
beside
his
cheek
the
snowy
column
from
its
shade
caught
whiteness
yet
his
countenance
raised
upward
burned
with
radiance
of
joy
whose
light
like
the
moon
struggling
through
the
night
of
clouds
did
break
with
beams
that
might
not
be
confined
i
paused
but
soon
his
gestures
kindled
new
power
as
by
the
moving
wind
the
waves
are
lifted
and
my
song
to
low
soft
notes
now
changed
and
dwindled
and
from
the
twinkling
wires
among
my
languid
fingers
drew
and
flung
circles
of
sound
yet
faint
in
aery
rings
they
bound
my
lionel
who
as
every
strain
grew
fainter
but
more
sweet
his
mien
sunk
with
the
sound
relaxedly
and
slowly
now
he
turned
to
me
as
slowly
faded
from
his
face
that
awful
joy
with
looks
serene
he
was
soon
drawn
to
my
embrace
and
my
wild
song
then
died
away
in
murmurs
words
i
dare
not
say
we
mixed
and
on
his
lips
mine
fed
till
they
methought
felt
still
and
cold
is
it
with
thee
love
i
said
no
word
no
look
no
motion
yes
there
was
a
change
but
spare
to
guess
nor
let
that
moment
hope
be
told
i
looked
and
knew
that
he
was
dead
and
fell
as
the
eagle
on
the
plain
falls
when
life
deserts
her
brain
and
the
mortal
lightning
is
veiled
again
o
that
i
were
now
dead
but
such
did
they
not
love
demand
too
much
those
dying
murmurs
he
forbade
o
that
i
once
again
were
mad
and
yet
dear
rosalind
not
so
for
i
would
live
to
share
thy
woe
sweet
boy
did
i
forget
thee
too
alas
we
know
not
what
we
do
when
we
speak
words
no
memory
more
is
in
my
mind
of
that
sea
shore
madness
came
on
me
and
a
troop
of
misty
shapes
did
seem
to
sit
beside
me
on
a
vessel
poop
and
the
clear
north
wind
was
driving
it
then
i
heard
strange
tongues
and
saw
strange
flowers
and
the
stars
methought
grew
unlike
ours
and
the
azure
sky
and
the
stormless
sea
made
me
believe
that
i
had
died
and
waked
in
a
world
which
was
to
me
drear
hell
though
heaven
to
all
beside
then
a
dead
sleep
fell
on
my
mind
whilst
animal
life
many
long
years
had
rescued
from
a
chasm
of
tears
and
when
i
woke
i
wept
to
find
that
the
same
lady
bright
and
wise
with
silver
locks
and
quick
brown
eyes
the
mother
of
my
lionel
had
tended
me
in
my
distress
and
died
some
months
before
nor
less
wonder
but
far
more
peace
and
joy
brought
in
that
hour
my
lovely
boy
for
through
that
trance
my
soul
had
well
the
impress
of
thy
being
kept
and
if
i
waked
or
if
i
slept
no
doubt
though
memory
faithless
be
thy
image
ever
dwelt
on
me
and
thus
o
lionel
like
thee
is
our
sweet
child
is
sure
most
strange
i
knew
not
of
so
great
a
change
as
that
which
gave
him
birth
who
now
is
all
the
solace
of
my
woe
that
lionel
great
wealth
had
left
by
will
to
me
and
that
of
all
the
ready
lies
of
law
bereft
my
child
and
me
might
well
befall
but
let
me
think
not
of
the
scorn
which
from
the
meanest
i
have
borne
when
for
my
child
beloved
sake
i
mixed
with
slaves
to
vindicate
the
very
laws
themselves
do
make
let
me
not
say
scorn
is
my
fate
lest
i
be
proud
suffering
the
same
with
those
who
live
in
deathless
fame
she
where
red
morning
thro
the
woods
is
burning
the
dew
said
rosalind
and
with
these
words
they
rose
and
towards
the
flood
of
the
blue
lake
beneath
the
leaves
now
wind
with
equal
steps
and
fingers
intertwined
thence
to
a
lonely
dwelling
where
the
shore
is
shadowed
with
steep
rocks
and
cypresses
cleave
with
their
dark
green
cones
the
silent
skies
and
with
their
shadows
the
clear
depths
below
and
where
a
little
terrace
from
its
bowers
of
blooming
myrtle
and
faint
scatters
its
fragrance
the
liquid
marble
of
the
windless
lake
and
where
the
aged
forest
limbs
look
hoar
under
the
leaves
which
their
green
garments
make
they
come
is
helen
home
and
clean
and
white
like
one
which
tyrants
spare
on
our
own
land
in
some
such
solitude
its
casements
bright
shone
through
their
in
the
morning
sun
and
even
within
was
scarce
like
italy
and
when
she
saw
how
all
things
there
were
planned
as
in
an
english
home
dim
memory
disturbed
poor
rosalind
she
stood
as
one
whose
mind
is
where
his
body
can
not
be
till
helen
led
her
where
her
child
yet
slept
and
said
that
brow
was
lionel
those
lips
were
his
and
so
he
ever
kept
one
arm
in
sleep
pillowing
his
head
with
it
you
can
not
see
his
eyes
they
are
two
wells
of
liquid
love
let
us
not
wake
him
yet
but
rosalind
could
bear
no
more
and
wept
a
shower
of
burning
tears
which
fell
upon
his
face
and
so
his
opening
lashes
shone
with
tears
unlike
his
own
as
he
did
leap
in
sudden
wonder
from
his
innocent
sleep
so
rosalind
and
helen
lived
together
thenceforth
changed
in
all
else
yet
friends
again
such
as
they
were
when
the
mountain
heather
they
wandered
in
their
youth
through
sun
and
rain
and
after
many
years
for
human
things
change
even
like
the
ocean
and
the
wind
her
daughter
was
restored
to
rosalind
and
in
their
circle
thence
some
visitings
of
joy
their
new
calm
would
intervene
a
lovely
child
she
was
of
looks
serene
and
motions
which
things
indifferent
shed
the
grace
and
gentleness
from
whence
they
came
and
helen
boy
grew
with
her
and
they
fed
from
the
same
flowers
of
thought
until
each
mind
like
springs
which
mingle
in
one
flood
became
and
in
their
union
soon
their
parents
saw
the
shadow
of
the
peace
denied
to
them
and
rosalind
for
when
the
living
stem
is
cankered
in
its
heart
the
tree
must
fall
died
ere
her
time
and
with
deep
grief
and
awe
the
pale
survivors
followed
her
remains
beyond
the
region
of
dissolving
rains
up
the
cold
mountain
she
was
wont
to
call
her
tomb
and
on
chiavenna
precipice
they
raised
a
pyramid
of
lasting
ice
whose
polished
sides
ere
day
had
yet
begun
caught
the
first
glow
of
the
unrisen
sun
the
last
when
it
had
sunk
and
thro
the
night
the
charioteers
of
arctos
wheeled
round
its
glittering
point
as
seen
from
helen
home
whose
sad
inhabitants
each
year
would
come
with
willing
steps
climbing
that
rugged
height
and
hang
long
locks
of
hair
and
garlands
bound
with
amaranth
flowers
which
in
the
clime
despite
filled
the
frore
air
with
unaccustomed
light
such
flowers
as
in
the
wintry
memory
bloom
of
one
friend
left
adorned
that
frozen
tomb
helen
whose
spirit
was
of
softer
mould
whose
sufferings
too
were
less
death
slowlier
led
into
the
peace
of
his
dominion
cold
she
died
among
her
kindred
being
old
and
know
that
if
love
die
not
in
the
dead
as
in
the
living
none
of

was
begun
at
marlow
and
thrown
aside
till
i
found
it
and
at
my
request
it
was
completed
shelley
had
no
care
for
any
of
his
poems
that
did
not
emanate
from
the
depths
of
his
mind
and
develop
some
high
or
abstruse
truth
when
he
does
touch
on
human
life
and
the
human
heart
no
pictures
can
be
more
faithful
more
delicate
more
subtle
or
more
pathetic
he
never
mentioned
love
but
he
shed
a
grace
borrowed
from
his
own
nature
that
scarcely
any
other
poet
has
bestowed
on
that
passion
when
he
spoke
of
it
as
the
law
of
life
which
inasmuch
as
we
rebel
against
we
err
and
injure
ourselves
and
others
he
promulgated
that
which
he
considered
an
irrefragable
truth
in
his
eyes
it
was
the
essence
of
our
being
and
all
woe
and
pain
arose
from
the
war
made
against
it
by
selfishness
or
insensibility
or
mistake
by
reverting
in
his
mind
to
this
first
principle
he
discovered
the
source
of
many
emotions
and
could
disclose
the
secrets
of
all
hearts
and
his
delineations
of
passion
and
emotion

maddalo
is
a
venetian
nobleman
of
ancient
family
and
of
great
fortune
who
without
mixing
much
in
the
society
of
his
countrymen
resides
chiefly
at
his
magnificent
palace
in
that
city
he
is
a
person
of
the
most
consummate
genius
and
capable
if
he
would
direct
his
energies
to
such
an
end
of
becoming
the
redeemer
of
his
degraded
country
but
it
is
his
weakness
to
be
proud
he
derives
from
a
comparison
of
his
own
extraordinary
mind
with
the
dwarfish
intellects
that
surround
him
an
intense
apprehension
of
the
nothingness
of
human
life
his
passions
and
his
powers
are
incomparably
greater
than
those
of
other
men
and
instead
of
the
latter
having
been
employed
in
curbing
the
former
they
have
mutually
lent
each
other
strength
his
ambition
preys
upon
itself
for
want
of
objects
which
it
can
consider
worthy
of
exertion
i
say
that
maddalo
is
proud
because
i
can
find
no
other
word
to
express
the
concentred
and
impatient
feelings
which
consume
him
but
it
is
on
his
own
hopes
and
affections
only
that
he
seems
to
trample
for
in
social
life
no
human
being
can
be
more
gentle
patient
and
unassuming
than
maddalo
he
is
cheerful
frank
and
witty
his
more
serious
conversation
is
a
sort
of
intoxication
men
are
held
by
it
as
by
a
spell
he
has
travelled
much
and
there
is
an
inexpressible
charm
in
his
relation
of
his
adventures
in
different
countries
julian
is
an
englishman
of
good
family
passionately
attached
to
those
philosophical
notions
which
assert
the
power
of
man
over
his
own
mind
and
the
immense
improvements
of
which
by
the
extinction
of
certain
moral
superstitions
human
society
may
be
yet
susceptible
without
concealing
the
evil
in
the
world
he
is
for
ever
speculating
how
good
may
be
made
superior
he
is
a
complete
infidel
and
a
scoffer
at
all
things
reputed
holy
and
maddalo
takes
a
wicked
pleasure
in
drawing
out
his
taunts
against
religion
what
maddalo
thinks
on
these
matters
is
not
exactly
known
julian
in
spite
of
his
heterodox
opinions
is
conjectured
by
his
friends
to
possess
some
good
qualities
how
far
this
is
possible
the
pious
reader
will
determine
julian
is
rather
serious
of
the
maniac
i
can
give
no
information
he
seems
by
his
own
account
to
have
been
disappointed
in
love
he
was
evidently
a
very
cultivated
and
amiable
person
when
in
his
right
senses
his
story
told
at
length
might
be
like
many
other
stories
of
the
same
kind
the
unconnected
exclamations
of
his
agony
will
perhaps
be
found
a
sufficient
comment
for
the
text
of
every
heart
i
rode
one
evening
with
count
maddalo
upon
the
bank
of
land
which
breaks
the
flow
of
adria
towards
venice
a
bare
strand
of
hillocks
heaped
from
sand
matted
with
thistles
and
amphibious
weeds
such
as
from
earth
embrace
the
salt
ooze
breeds
is
this
an
uninhabited
which
the
lone
fisher
when
his
nets
are
dried
abandons
and
no
other
object
breaks
the
waste
but
one
dwarf
tree
and
some
few
stakes
broken
and
unrepaired
and
the
tide
makes
a
narrow
space
of
level
sand
thereon
where
was
our
wont
to
ride
while
day
went
down
this
ride
was
my
delight
i
love
all
waste
and
solitary
places
where
we
taste
the
pleasure
of
believing
what
we
see
is
boundless
as
we
wish
our
souls
to
be
and
such
was
this
wide
ocean
and
this
shore
more
barren
than
its
billows
and
yet
more
than
all
with
a
remembered
friend
i
love
to
ride
as
then
i
rode
for
the
winds
drove
the
living
spray
along
the
sunny
air
into
our
faces
the
blue
heavens
were
bare
stripped
to
their
depths
by
the
awakening
north
and
from
the
waves
sound
like
delight
broke
forth
harmonising
with
solitude
and
sent
into
our
hearts
aereal
merriment
so
as
we
rode
we
talked
and
the
swift
thought
winging
itself
with
laughter
lingered
not
but
flew
from
brain
to
brain
such
glee
was
ours
charged
with
light
memories
of
remembered
hours
none
slow
enough
for
sadness
till
we
came
homeward
which
always
makes
the
spirit
tame
this
day
had
been
cheerful
but
cold
and
now
the
sun
was
sinking
and
the
wind
also
our
talk
grew
somewhat
serious
as
may
be
talk
interrupted
with
such
raillery
as
mocks
itself
because
it
can
not
scorn
the
thoughts
it
would
extinguish
was
forlorn
yet
pleasing
such
as
once
so
poets
tell
the
devils
held
within
the
dales
of
hell
concerning
god
freewill
and
destiny
of
all
that
earth
has
been
or
yet
may
be
all
that
vain
men
imagine
or
believe
or
hope
can
paint
or
suffering
may
achieve
we
descanted
and
i
for
ever
still
is
it
not
wise
to
make
the
best
of
ill
argued
against
despondency
but
pride
made
my
companion
take
the
darker
side
the
sense
that
he
was
greater
than
his
kind
had
struck
methinks
his
eagle
spirit
blind
by
gazing
on
its
own
exceeding
light
meanwhile
the
sun
paused
ere
it
should
alight
over
the
horizon
of
the
mountains
oh
how
beautiful
is
sunset
when
the
glow
of
heaven
descends
upon
a
land
like
thee
thou
paradise
of
exiles
italy
thy
mountains
seas
and
vineyards
and
the
towers
of
cities
they
encircle
it
was
ours
to
stand
on
thee
beholding
it
and
then
just
where
we
had
dismounted
the
count
men
were
waiting
for
us
with
the
as
those
who
pause
on
some
delightful
way
though
bent
on
pleasant
pilgrimage
we
stood
looking
upon
the
evening
and
the
flood
which
lay
between
the
city
and
the
shore
paved
with
the
image
of
the
sky
the
hoar
and
aery
alps
towards
the
north
appeared
through
mist
an
bulwark
reared
between
the
east
and
west
and
half
the
sky
was
roofed
with
clouds
of
rich
emblazonry
dark
purple
at
the
zenith
which
still
grew
down
the
steep
west
into
a
wondrous
hue
brighter
than
burning
gold
even
to
the
rent
where
the
swift
sun
yet
paused
in
his
descent
among
the
hills
they
were
those
famous
euganean
hills
which
bear
as
seen
from
lido
thro
the
harbour
piles
the
likeness
of
a
clump
of
peaked
isles
and
then
as
if
the
earth
and
sea
had
been
dissolved
into
one
lake
of
fire
were
seen
those
mountains
towering
as
from
waves
of
flame
around
the
vaporous
sun
from
which
there
came
the
inmost
purple
spirit
of
light
and
made
their
very
peaks
transparent
it
fade
said
my
companion
will
show
you
soon
a
better
station
so
the
lagune
we
glided
and
from
that
funereal
bark
i
leaned
and
saw
the
city
and
could
mark
how
from
their
many
isles
in
evening
gleam
its
temples
and
its
palaces
did
seem
like
fabrics
of
enchantment
piled
to
heaven
i
was
about
to
speak
when
are
even
now
at
the
point
i
meant
said
maddalo
and
bade
the
gondolieri
cease
to
row
julian
on
the
west
and
listen
well
if
you
hear
not
a
deep
and
heavy
bell
i
looked
and
saw
between
us
and
the
sun
a
building
on
an
island
such
a
one
as
age
to
age
might
add
for
uses
vile
a
windowless
deformed
and
dreary
pile
and
on
the
top
an
open
tower
where
hung
a
bell
which
in
the
radiance
swayed
and
swung
we
could
just
hear
its
hoarse
and
iron
tongue
the
broad
sun
sunk
behind
it
and
it
tolled
in
strong
and
black
we
behold
shall
be
the
madhouse
and
its
belfry
tower
said
maddalo
ever
at
this
hour
those
who
may
cross
the
water
hear
that
bell
which
calls
the
maniacs
each
one
from
his
cell
to
vespers
much
skill
as
need
to
pray
in
thanks
or
hope
for
their
dark
lot
have
they
to
their
stern
maker
i
replied
ho
you
talk
as
in
years
past
said
maddalo
strange
men
change
not
you
were
ever
still
among
christ
flock
a
perilous
infidel
a
wolf
for
the
meek
lambs
if
you
ca
swim
beware
of
providence
i
looked
on
him
but
the
gay
smile
had
faded
in
his
eye
such
he
cried
our
mortality
and
this
must
be
the
emblem
and
the
sign
of
what
should
be
eternal
and
divine
and
like
that
black
and
dreary
bell
the
soul
hung
in
a
tower
must
toll
our
thoughts
and
our
desires
to
meet
below
round
the
rent
heart
and
pray
as
madmen
do
for
what
they
know
not
till
the
night
of
death
as
sunset
that
strange
vision
severeth
our
memory
from
itself
and
us
from
all
we
sought
and
yet
were
baffled
i
recall
the
sense
of
what
he
said
although
i
mar
the
force
of
his
expressions
the
broad
star
of
day
meanwhile
had
sunk
behind
the
hill
and
the
black
bell
became
invisible
and
the
red
tower
looked
gray
and
all
between
the
churches
ships
and
palaces
were
seen
huddled
in
gloom
into
the
purple
sea
the
orange
hues
of
heaven
sunk
silently
we
hardly
spoke
and
soon
the
gondola
conveyed
me
to
my
lodging
by
the
way
the
following
morn
was
rainy
cold
and
dim
ere
maddalo
arose
i
called
on
him
and
whilst
i
waited
with
his
child
i
played
a
lovelier
toy
sweet
nature
never
made
a
serious
subtle
wild
yet
gentle
being
graceful
without
design
and
unforeseeing
with
eyes
oh
speak
not
of
her
eyes
which
seem
twin
mirrors
of
italian
heaven
yet
gleam
with
such
deep
meaning
as
we
never
see
but
in
the
human
countenance
with
me
she
was
a
special
favourite
i
had
nursed
her
fine
and
feeble
limbs
when
she
came
first
to
this
bleak
world
and
she
yet
seemed
to
know
on
second
sight
her
ancient
playfellow
less
changed
than
she
was
by
six
months
or
so
for
after
her
first
shyness
was
worn
out
we
sate
there
rolling
billiard
balls
about
when
the
count
entered
salutations
past
word
you
spoke
last
night
might
well
have
cast
a
darkness
on
my
spirit
if
man
be
the
passive
thing
you
say
i
should
not
see
much
harm
in
the
religions
and
old
saws
tho
i
may
never
own
such
leaden
laws
which
break
a
teachless
nature
to
the
yoke
mine
is
another
faith
thus
much
i
spoke
and
noting
he
replied
not
added
this
lovely
child
blithe
innocent
and
free
she
spends
a
happy
time
with
little
care
while
we
to
such
sick
thoughts
subjected
are
as
came
on
you
last
night
it
is
our
will
that
thus
enchains
us
to
permitted
ill
we
might
be
otherwise
we
might
be
all
we
dream
of
happy
high
majestical
where
is
the
love
beauty
and
truth
we
seek
but
in
our
mind
and
if
we
were
not
weak
should
we
be
less
in
deed
than
in
desire
if
we
were
not
weak
and
we
aspire
how
vainly
to
be
strong
said
maddalo
talk
utopia
remains
to
know
i
then
rejoined
those
who
try
may
find
how
strong
the
chains
are
which
our
spirit
bind
brittle
perchance
as
straw
we
are
assured
much
may
be
conquered
much
may
be
endured
of
what
degrades
and
crushes
us
we
know
that
we
have
power
over
ourselves
to
do
and
suffer
what
we
know
not
till
we
try
but
something
nobler
than
to
live
and
die
so
taught
those
kings
of
old
philosophy
who
reigned
before
religion
made
men
blind
and
those
who
suffer
with
their
suffering
kind
yet
feel
their
faith
religion
dear
friend
said
maddalo
judgement
will
not
bend
to
your
opinion
though
i
think
you
might
make
such
a
system
as
far
as
words
go
i
knew
one
like
you
who
to
this
city
came
some
months
ago
with
whom
i
argued
in
this
sort
and
he
is
now
gone
mad
and
so
he
answered
me
poor
fellow
but
if
you
would
like
to
go
we
visit
him
and
his
wild
talk
will
show
how
vain
are
such
aspiring
theories
hope
to
prove
the
induction
otherwise
and
that
a
want
of
that
true
theory
still
which
seeks
a
soul
of
goodness
in
things
ill
or
in
himself
or
others
has
thus
bowed
his
being
there
are
some
by
nature
proud
who
patient
in
all
else
demand
but
this
to
love
and
be
beloved
with
gentleness
and
being
scorned
what
wonder
if
they
die
some
living
death
this
is
not
destiny
but
man
own
wilful
as
thus
i
spoke
servants
announced
the
gondola
and
we
through
the
rain
and
sea
sailed
to
the
island
where
the
madhouse
stands
we
disembarked
the
clap
of
tortured
hands
fierce
yells
and
howlings
and
lamentings
keen
and
laughter
where
complaint
had
merrier
been
moans
shrieks
and
curses
and
blaspheming
prayers
accosted
us
we
climbed
the
oozy
stairs
into
an
old
courtyard
i
heard
on
high
then
fragments
of
most
touching
melody
but
looking
up
saw
not
the
singer
there
through
the
black
bars
in
the
tempestuous
air
i
saw
like
weeds
on
a
wrecked
palace
growing
long
tangled
locks
flung
wildly
forth
and
flowing
of
those
who
on
a
sudden
were
beguiled
into
strange
silence
and
looked
forth
and
smiled
hearing
sweet
sounds
then
i
there
were
a
cure
of
these
with
patience
and
kind
care
if
music
can
thus
move
but
what
is
he
whom
we
seek
here
his
sad
history
i
know
but
this
said
maddalo
came
to
venice
a
dejected
man
and
fame
said
he
was
wealthy
or
he
had
been
so
some
thought
the
loss
of
fortune
wrought
him
woe
but
he
was
ever
talking
in
such
sort
as
you
do
far
more
sadly
he
seemed
hurt
even
as
a
man
with
his
peculiar
wrong
to
hear
but
of
the
oppression
of
the
strong
or
those
absurd
deceits
i
think
with
you
in
some
respects
you
know
which
carry
through
the
excellent
impostors
of
this
earth
when
they
outface
detection
he
had
worth
poor
fellow
but
a
humorist
in
his
way
what
drove
him
mad
can
not
say
a
lady
came
with
him
from
france
and
when
she
left
him
and
returned
he
wandered
then
about
yon
lonely
isles
of
desert
sand
till
he
grew
wild
he
had
no
cash
or
land
remaining
the
police
had
brought
him
here
some
fancy
took
him
and
he
would
not
bear
removal
so
i
fitted
up
for
him
those
rooms
beside
the
sea
to
please
his
whim
and
sent
him
busts
and
books
and
urns
for
flowers
which
had
adorned
his
life
in
happier
hours
and
instruments
of
music
you
may
guess
a
stranger
could
do
little
more
or
less
for
one
so
gentle
and
unfortunate
and
those
are
his
sweet
strains
which
charm
the
weight
from
madmen
chains
and
make
this
hell
appear
a
heaven
of
sacred
silence
hushed
to
hear
this
was
kind
of
you
he
had
no
claim
as
the
world
says
but
the
very
same
which
i
on
all
mankind
were
i
as
he
fallen
to
such
deep
reverse
his
melody
is
interrupted
now
we
hear
the
din
of
madmen
shriek
on
shriek
again
begin
let
us
now
visit
him
after
this
strain
he
ever
communes
with
himself
again
and
sees
nor
hears
not
any
having
said
these
words
we
called
the
keeper
and
he
led
to
an
apartment
opening
on
the
sea
there
the
poor
wretch
was
sitting
mournfully
near
a
piano
his
pale
fingers
twined
one
with
the
other
and
the
ooze
and
wind
rushed
through
an
open
casement
and
did
sway
his
hair
and
starred
it
with
the
brackish
spray
his
head
was
leaning
on
a
music
book
and
he
was
muttering
and
his
lean
limbs
shook
his
lips
were
pressed
against
a
folded
leaf
in
hue
too
beautiful
for
health
and
grief
smiled
in
their
motions
as
they
lay
apart
as
one
who
wrought
from
his
own
fervid
heart
the
eloquence
of
passion
soon
he
raised
his
sad
meek
face
and
eyes
lustrous
and
glazed
and
spoke
sometimes
as
one
who
wrote
and
thought
his
words
might
move
some
heart
that
heeded
not
if
sent
to
distant
lands
and
then
as
one
reproaching
deeds
never
to
be
undone
with
wondering
then
his
speech
was
lost
in
grief
and
then
his
words
came
each
unmodulated
cold
expressionless
but
that
from
one
jarred
accent
you
might
guess
it
was
despair
made
them
so
uniform
and
all
the
while
the
loud
and
gusty
storm
hissed
through
the
window
and
we
stood
behind
stealing
his
accents
from
the
envious
wind
unseen
i
yet
remember
what
he
said
distinctly
such
impression
his
words
made
after
month
he
cried
bear
this
load
and
as
a
jade
urged
by
the
whip
and
goad
to
drag
life
on
which
like
a
heavy
chain
lengthens
behind
with
many
a
link
of
pain
and
not
to
speak
my
grief
o
not
to
dare
to
give
a
human
voice
to
my
despair
but
live
and
move
and
wretched
thing
smile
on
as
if
i
never
went
aside
to
groan
and
wear
this
mask
of
falsehood
even
to
those
who
are
most
dear
not
for
my
own
repose
alas
no
scorn
or
pain
or
hate
could
be
so
heavy
as
that
falsehood
is
to
me
but
that
i
can
not
bear
more
altered
faces
than
needs
must
be
more
changed
and
cold
embraces
more
misery
disappointment
and
mistrust
to
own
me
for
their
father
would
the
dust
were
covered
in
upon
my
body
now
that
the
life
ceased
to
toil
within
my
brow
and
then
these
thoughts
would
at
the
least
be
fled
let
us
not
fear
such
pain
can
vex
the
dead
power
delights
to
torture
us
i
know
that
to
myself
i
do
not
wholly
owe
what
now
i
suffer
though
in
part
i
may
alas
none
strewed
sweet
flowers
upon
the
way
where
wandering
heedlessly
i
met
pale
pain
my
shadow
which
will
leave
me
not
again
if
i
have
erred
there
was
no
joy
in
error
but
pain
and
insult
and
unrest
and
terror
i
have
not
as
some
do
bought
penitence
with
pleasure
and
a
dark
yet
sweet
offence
for
then
if
love
and
tenderness
and
truth
had
overlived
hope
momentary
youth
my
creed
should
have
redeemed
me
from
repenting
but
loathed
scorn
and
outrage
unrelenting
met
love
excited
by
far
other
seeming
until
the
end
was
gained
as
one
from
dreaming
of
sweetest
peace
i
woke
and
found
my
state
such
as
it
thou
my
spirit
mate
who
for
thou
art
compassionate
and
wise
wouldst
pity
me
from
thy
most
gentle
eyes
if
this
sad
writing
thou
shouldst
ever
see
my
secret
groans
must
be
unheard
by
thee
thou
wouldst
weep
tears
bitter
as
blood
to
know
thy
lost
friend
incommunicable
woe
few
by
whom
my
nature
has
been
weighed
in
friendship
let
me
not
that
name
degrade
by
placing
on
your
hearts
the
secret
load
which
crushes
mine
to
dust
there
is
one
road
to
peace
and
that
is
truth
which
follow
ye
love
sometimes
leads
astray
to
misery
yet
think
not
though
subdued
and
i
may
well
say
that
i
am
subdued
that
the
full
hell
within
me
would
infect
the
untainted
breast
of
sacred
nature
with
its
own
unrest
as
some
perverted
beings
think
to
find
in
scorn
or
hate
a
medicine
for
the
mind
which
scorn
or
hate
have
wounded
o
how
vain
the
dagger
heals
not
but
may
rend
again
believe
that
i
am
ever
still
the
same
in
creed
as
in
resolve
and
what
may
tame
my
heart
must
leave
the
understanding
free
or
all
would
sink
in
this
keen
agony
nor
dream
that
i
will
join
the
vulgar
cry
or
with
my
silence
sanction
tyranny
or
seek
a
moment
shelter
from
my
pain
in
any
madness
which
the
world
calls
gain
ambition
or
revenge
or
thoughts
as
stern
as
those
which
make
me
what
i
am
or
turn
to
avarice
or
misanthropy
or
lust
heap
on
me
soon
o
grave
thy
welcome
dust
till
then
the
dungeon
may
demand
its
prey
and
poverty
and
shame
may
meet
and
say
halting
beside
me
on
the
public
way
that
youth
is
ours
let
sit
beside
him
he
may
live
some
six
months
yet
or
the
red
scaffold
as
our
country
bends
may
ask
some
willing
victim
or
ye
friends
may
fall
under
some
sorrow
which
this
heart
or
hand
may
share
or
vanquish
or
avert
i
am
prepared
in
truth
with
no
proud
joy
to
do
or
suffer
aught
as
when
a
boy
i
did
devote
to
justice
and
to
love
my
nature
worthless
now
must
remove
a
veil
from
my
pent
mind
is
torn
aside
o
pallid
as
death
dedicated
bride
thou
mockery
which
art
sitting
by
my
side
am
i
not
wan
like
thee
at
the
grave
call
i
haste
invited
to
thy
to
greet
the
ghastly
paramour
for
whom
thou
hast
deserted
me
and
made
the
tomb
thy
bridal
bed
but
i
beside
your
feet
will
lie
and
watch
ye
from
my
thus
wide
awake
tho
dead
yet
stay
o
stay
go
not
so
soon
i
know
not
what
i
say
hear
but
my
reasons
i
am
mad
i
fear
my
fancy
is
thou
art
not
here
pale
art
thou
is
most
true
but
thou
art
gone
thy
work
is
finished
i
am
left
alone
was
it
i
who
wooed
thee
to
this
breast
which
like
a
serpent
thou
envenomest
as
in
repayment
of
the
warmth
it
lent
didst
thou
not
seek
me
for
thine
own
content
did
not
thy
love
awaken
mine
i
thought
that
thou
wert
she
who
said
you
kiss
me
not
ever
i
fear
you
do
not
love
me
now
in
truth
i
loved
even
to
my
overthrow
her
who
would
fain
forget
these
words
but
they
cling
to
her
mind
and
can
not
pass
away
say
that
i
am
proud
that
when
i
speak
my
lip
is
tortured
with
the
wrongs
which
break
the
spirit
it
expresses
never
one
humbled
himself
before
as
i
have
done
even
the
instinctive
worm
on
which
we
tread
turns
though
it
wound
not
then
with
prostrate
head
sinks
in
the
dusk
and
writhes
like
me
and
dies
no
wears
a
living
death
of
agonies
as
the
slow
shadows
of
the
pointed
grass
mark
the
eternal
periods
his
pangs
pass
slow
making
moments
be
as
mine
seem
each
an
immortality
you
had
never
seen
me
never
heard
my
voice
and
more
than
all
had
endured
the
deep
pollution
of
my
loathed
embrace
that
your
eyes
had
lied
love
in
my
face
that
like
some
maniac
monk
i
had
torn
out
the
nerves
of
manhood
by
their
bleeding
root
with
mine
own
quivering
fingers
so
that
our
hearts
had
for
a
moment
mingled
there
to
disunite
in
horror
these
were
not
with
thee
like
some
suppressed
and
hideous
thought
which
flits
athwart
our
musings
but
can
find
no
rest
within
a
pure
and
gentle
mind
thou
sealedst
them
with
many
a
bare
broad
word
and
searedst
my
memory
them
for
i
heard
and
can
forget
not
they
were
ministered
one
after
one
those
curses
mix
them
up
like
poisons
in
one
cup
and
they
will
make
one
blessing
which
thou
didst
imprecate
for
on
me
death
were
a
cruel
punishment
for
one
most
cruel
if
such
can
love
to
make
that
love
the
fuel
of
the
mind
hell
hate
scorn
remorse
despair
but
me
whose
heart
a
stranger
tear
might
wear
as
the
sandy
who
loved
and
pitied
all
things
and
could
moan
for
woes
which
others
hear
not
and
could
see
the
absent
with
the
glance
of
phantasy
and
with
the
poor
and
trampled
sit
and
weep
following
the
captive
to
his
dungeon
deep
me
who
am
as
a
nerve
which
do
creep
the
else
unfelt
oppressions
of
this
earth
and
was
to
thee
the
flame
upon
thy
hearth
when
all
beside
was
cold
that
thou
on
me
shouldst
rain
these
plagues
of
blistering
agony
such
curses
are
from
lips
once
eloquent
with
love
too
partial
praise
let
none
relent
who
intend
deeds
too
dreadful
for
a
name
henceforth
if
an
example
for
the
same
they
seek
for
thou
on
me
lookedst
so
and
so
and
didst
speak
thus
and
thus
i
live
to
show
how
much
men
bear
and
die
not
wilt
tell
with
the
grimace
of
hate
how
horrible
it
was
to
meet
my
love
when
thine
grew
less
thou
wilt
admire
how
i
could
address
such
features
to
love
work
this
taunt
though
true
for
indeed
nature
nor
in
form
nor
hue
bestowed
on
me
her
choicest
workmanship
shall
not
be
thy
defence
for
since
thy
lip
met
mine
first
years
long
past
since
thine
eye
kindled
with
soft
fire
under
mine
i
have
not
dwindled
nor
changed
in
mind
or
body
or
in
aught
but
as
love
changes
what
it
loveth
not
after
long
years
and
many
trials
vain
are
words
i
thought
never
to
speak
again
not
even
in
secret
not
to
mine
own
heart
but
from
my
lips
the
unwilling
accents
start
and
from
my
pen
the
words
flow
as
i
write
dazzling
my
eyes
with
scalding
tears
my
sight
is
dim
to
see
that
charactered
in
vain
on
this
unfeeling
leaf
which
burns
the
brain
and
eats
into
it
blotting
all
things
fair
and
wise
and
good
which
time
had
written
there
who
inflict
must
suffer
for
they
see
the
work
of
their
own
hearts
and
this
must
be
our
chastisement
or
recompense
o
child
i
would
that
thine
were
like
to
be
more
mild
for
both
our
wretched
sakes
for
thine
the
most
who
feelest
already
all
that
thou
hast
lost
without
the
power
to
wish
it
thine
again
and
as
slow
years
pass
a
funereal
train
each
with
the
ghost
of
some
lost
hope
or
friend
following
it
like
its
shadow
wilt
thou
bend
no
thought
on
my
dead
memory
love
fear
me
not
against
thee
i
would
not
move
a
finger
in
despite
do
i
not
live
that
thou
mayst
have
less
bitter
cause
to
grieve
i
give
thee
tears
for
scorn
and
love
for
hate
and
that
thy
lot
may
be
less
desolate
than
his
on
whom
thou
tramplest
i
refrain
from
that
sweet
sleep
which
medicines
all
pain
then
when
thou
speakest
of
me
never
say
he
could
forgive
not
here
i
cast
away
all
human
passions
all
revenge
all
pride
i
think
speak
act
no
ill
i
do
but
hide
under
these
words
like
embers
every
spark
of
that
which
has
consumed
me
quick
and
dark
the
grave
is
yawning
as
its
roof
shall
cover
my
limbs
with
dust
and
worms
under
and
over
so
let
oblivion
hide
this
grief
the
air
closes
upon
my
accents
as
despair
upon
my
heart
let
death
upon
despair
he
ceased
and
overcome
leant
back
awhile
then
rising
with
a
melancholy
smile
went
to
a
sofa
and
lay
down
and
slept
a
heavy
sleep
and
in
his
dreams
he
wept
and
muttered
some
familiar
name
and
we
wept
without
shame
in
his
society
i
think
i
never
was
impressed
so
much
the
man
who
were
not
must
have
lacked
a
touch
of
human
nature
then
we
lingered
not
although
our
argument
was
quite
forgot
but
calling
the
attendants
went
to
dine
at
maddalo
yet
neither
cheer
nor
wine
could
give
us
spirits
for
we
talked
of
him
and
nothing
else
till
daylight
made
stars
dim
and
we
agreed
his
was
some
dreadful
ill
wrought
on
him
boldly
yet
unspeakable
by
a
dear
friend
some
deadly
change
in
love
of
one
vowed
deeply
which
he
dreamed
not
of
for
whose
sake
he
it
seemed
had
fixed
a
blot
of
falsehood
on
his
mind
which
flourished
not
but
in
the
light
of
truth
and
having
stamped
this
canker
on
his
youth
she
had
abandoned
him
and
how
much
more
might
be
his
woe
we
guessed
not
he
had
store
of
friends
and
fortune
once
as
we
could
guess
from
his
nice
habits
and
his
gentleness
these
were
now
lost
it
were
a
grief
indeed
if
he
had
changed
one
unsustaining
reed
for
all
that
such
a
man
might
else
adorn
the
colours
of
his
mind
seemed
yet
unworn
for
the
wild
language
of
his
grief
was
high
such
as
in
measure
were
called
poetry
and
i
remember
one
remark
which
then
maddalo
made
he
said
wretched
men
are
cradled
into
poetry
by
wrong
they
learn
in
suffering
what
they
teach
in
song
if
i
had
been
an
unconnected
man
i
from
this
moment
should
have
formed
some
plan
never
to
leave
sweet
venice
for
to
me
it
was
delight
to
ride
by
the
lone
sea
and
then
the
town
is
silent
one
may
write
or
read
in
gondolas
by
day
or
night
having
the
little
brazen
lamp
alight
unseen
uninterrupted
books
are
there
pictures
and
casts
from
all
those
statues
fair
which
were
with
poetry
and
all
we
seek
in
towns
with
little
to
recall
regrets
for
the
green
country
i
might
sit
in
maddalo
great
palace
and
his
wit
and
subtle
talk
would
cheer
the
winter
night
and
make
me
know
myself
and
the
firelight
would
flash
upon
our
faces
till
the
day
might
dawn
and
make
me
wonder
at
my
stay
but
i
had
friends
in
london
too
the
chief
attraction
here
was
that
i
sought
relief
from
the
deep
tenderness
that
maniac
wrought
within
me
was
perhaps
an
idle
thought
but
i
imagined
that
if
day
by
day
i
watched
him
and
but
seldom
went
away
and
studied
all
the
beatings
of
his
heart
with
zeal
as
men
study
some
stubborn
art
for
their
own
good
and
could
by
patience
find
an
entrance
to
the
caverns
of
his
mind
i
might
reclaim
him
from
this
dark
estate
in
friendships
i
had
been
most
fortunate
yet
never
saw
i
one
whom
i
would
call
more
willingly
my
friend
and
this
was
all
accomplished
not
such
dreams
of
baseless
good
oft
come
and
go
in
crowds
or
solitude
and
leave
no
trace
but
what
i
now
designed
made
for
long
years
impression
on
my
mind
the
following
morning
urged
by
my
affairs
i
left
bright
venice
after
many
years
and
many
changes
i
returned
the
name
of
venice
and
its
aspect
was
the
same
but
maddalo
was
travelling
far
away
among
the
mountains
of
armenia
his
dog
was
dead
his
child
had
now
become
a
woman
such
as
it
has
been
my
doom
to
meet
with
few
a
wonder
of
this
earth
where
there
is
little
of
transcendent
worth
like
one
of
shakespeare
women
kindly
she
and
with
a
manner
beyond
courtesy
received
her
father
friend
and
when
i
asked
of
the
lorn
maniac
she
her
memory
tasked
and
told
as
she
had
heard
the
mournful
tale
the
poor
sufferer
health
began
to
fail
two
years
from
my
departure
but
that
then
the
lady
who
had
left
him
came
again
her
mien
had
been
imperious
but
she
now
looked
meek
perhaps
remorse
had
brought
her
low
her
coming
made
him
better
and
they
stayed
together
at
my
father
for
i
played
as
i
remember
with
the
lady
shawl
i
might
be
six
years
old
but
after
all
she
left
her
heart
must
have
been
tough
how
did
it
end
was
not
this
enough
they
met
they
parted
is
there
no
more
within
that
interval
which
bore
the
stamp
of
why
they
parted
how
they
met
yet
if
thine
aged
eyes
disdain
to
wet
those
wrinkled
cheeks
with
youth
remembered
tears
ask
me
no
more
but
let
the
silent
years
be
closed
and
cered
over
their
memory
as
yon
mute
marble
where
their
corpses
lie
i
urged
and
questioned
still
she
told
me
how
all
happened
but
the
cold
world
shall
not
know
cancelled
fragments
of
julian
and
maddalo
think
you
the
dead
are
dust
and
clay
what
should
they
be
the
last
hour
of
day
look
on
the
west
how
beautiful
it
is
vaulted
with
radiant
vapours
the
deep
bliss
of
that
unutterable
light
has
made
the
edges
of
that
cloud
fade
into
a
hue
like
some
harmonious
thought
wasting
itself
on
that
which
it
had
wrought
till
it
dies
and
between
the
light
hues
of
the
tender
pure
serene
and
infinite
tranquillity
of
heaven
ay
beautiful
but
when
not
the
only
comfort
which
remains

note
by
shelley
from
the
baths
of
lucca
in
shelley
visited
venice
and
circumstances
rendering
it
eligible
that
we
should
remain
a
few
weeks
in
the
neighbourhood
of
that
city
he
accepted
the
offer
of
lord
byron
who
lent
him
the
use
of
a
villa
he
rented
near
este
and
he
sent
for
his
family
from
lucca
to
join
him
i
capuccini
was
a
villa
built
on
the
site
of
a
capuchin
convent
demolished
when
the
french
suppressed
religious
houses
it
was
situated
on
the
very
overhanging
brow
of
a
low
hill
at
the
foot
of
a
range
of
higher
ones
the
house
was
cheerful
and
pleasant
a
walk
a
pergola
as
it
is
called
in
italian
led
from
the
to
a
at
the
end
of
the
garden
which
shelley
made
his
study
and
in
which
he
began
the
prometheus
and
here
also
as
he
mentions
in
a
letter
he
wrote
julian
and
maddalo
a
slight
ravine
with
a
road
in
its
depth
divided
the
garden
from
the
hill
on
which
stood
the
ruins
of
the
ancient
castle
of
este
whose
dark
massive
wall
gave
forth
an
echo
and
from
whose
ruined
crevices
owls

from

plain

to

by

far
apennines

to

was

our

an

became
alarmed
hastened

when

arrived
at

we
found
that

at

before

fled
from

the

tragic
writers
in
selecting
as
their
subject
any
portion
of
their
national
history
or
mythology
employed
in
their
treatment
of
it
a
certain
arbitrary
discretion
they
by
no
means
conceived
themselves
bound
to
adhere
to
the
common
interpretation
or
to
imitate
in
story
as
in
title
their
rivals
and
predecessors
such
a
system
would
have
amounted
to
a
resignation
of
those
claims
to
preference
over
their
competitors
which
incited
the
composition
the
agamemnonian
story
was
exhibited
on
the
athenian
theatre
with
as
many
variations
as
dramas
i
have
presumed
to
employ
a
similar
license
the
prometheus
unbound
of
aeschylus
supposed
the
reconciliation
of
jupiter
with
his
victim
as
the
price
of
the
disclosure
of
the
danger
threatened
to
his
empire
by
the
consummation
of
his
marriage
with
thetis
thetis
according
to
this
view
of
the
subject
was
given
in
marriage
to
peleus
and
prometheus
by
the
permission
of
jupiter
delivered
from
his
captivity
by
hercules
had
i
framed
my
story
on
this
model
i
should
have
done
no
more
than
have
attempted
to
restore
the
lost
drama
of
aeschylus
an
ambition
which
if
my
preference
to
this
mode
of
treating
the
subject
had
incited
me
to
cherish
the
recollection
of
the
high
comparison
such
an
attempt
would
challenge
might
well
abate
but
in
truth
i
was
averse
from
a
catastrophe
so
feeble
as
that
of
reconciling
the
champion
with
the
oppressor
of
mankind
the
moral
interest
of
the
fable
which
is
so
powerfully
sustained
by
the
sufferings
and
endurance
of
prometheus
would
be
annihilated
if
we
could
conceive
of
him
as
unsaying
his
high
language
and
quailing
before
his
successful
and
perfidious
adversary
the
only
imaginary
being
resembling
in
any
degree
prometheus
is
satan
and
prometheus
is
in
my
judgement
a
more
poetical
character
than
satan
because
in
addition
to
courage
and
majesty
and
firm
and
patient
opposition
to
omnipotent
force
he
is
susceptible
of
being
described
as
exempt
from
the
taints
of
ambition
envy
revenge
and
a
desire
for
personal
aggrandisement
which
in
the
hero
of
paradise
lost
interfere
with
the
interest
the
character
of
satan
engenders
in
the
mind
a
pernicious
casuistry
which
leads
us
to
weigh
his
faults
with
his
wrongs
and
to
excuse
the
former
because
the
latter
exceed
all
measure
in
the
minds
of
those
who
consider
that
magnificent
fiction
with
a
religious
feeling
it
engenders
something
worse
but
prometheus
is
as
it
were
the
type
of
the
highest
perfection
of
moral
and
intellectual
nature
impelled
by
the
purest
and
the
truest
motives
to
the
best
and
noblest
ends
this
poem
was
chiefly
written
upon
the
mountainous
ruins
of
the
baths
of
caracalla
among
the
flowery
glades
and
thickets
of
odoriferous
blossoming
trees
which
are
extended
in
ever
winding
labyrinths
upon
its
immense
platforms
and
dizzy
arches
suspended
in
the
air
the
bright
blue
sky
of
rome
and
the
effect
of
the
vigorous
awakening
spring
in
that
divinest
climate
and
the
new
life
with
which
it
drenches
the
spirits
even
to
intoxication
were
the
inspiration
of
this
drama
the
imagery
which
i
have
employed
will
be
found
in
many
instances
to
have
been
drawn
from
the
operations
of
the
human
mind
or
from
those
external
actions
by
which
they
are
expressed
this
is
unusual
in
modern
poetry
although
dante
and
shakespeare
are
full
of
instances
of
the
same
kind
dante
indeed
more
than
any
other
poet
and
with
greater
success
but
the
greek
poets
as
writers
to
whom
no
resource
of
awakening
the
sympathy
of
their
contemporaries
was
unknown
were
in
the
habitual
use
of
this
power
and
it
is
the
study
of
their
works
since
a
higher
merit
would
probably
be
denied
me
to
which
i
am
willing
that
my
readers
should
impute
this
singularity
one
word
is
due
in
candour
to
the
degree
in
which
the
study
of
contemporary
writings
may
have
tinged
my
composition
for
such
has
been
a
topic
of
censure
with
regard
to
poems
far
more
popular
and
indeed
more
deservedly
popular
than
mine
it
is
impossible
that
any
one
who
inhabits
the
same
age
with
such
writers
as
those
who
stand
in
the
foremost
ranks
of
our
own
can
conscientiously
assure
himself
that
his
language
and
tone
of
thought
may
not
have
been
modified
by
the
study
of
the
productions
of
those
extraordinary
intellects
it
is
true
that
not
the
spirit
of
their
genius
but
the
forms
in
which
it
has
manifested
itself
are
due
less
to
the
peculiarities
of
their
own
minds
than
to
the
peculiarity
of
the
moral
and
intellectual
condition
of
the
minds
among
which
they
have
been
produced
thus
a
number
of
writers
possess
the
form
whilst
they
want
the
spirit
of
those
whom
it
is
alleged
they
imitate
because
the
former
is
the
endowment
of
the
age
in
which
they
live
and
the
latter
must
be
the
uncommunicated
lightning
of
their
own
mind
the
peculiar
style
of
intense
and
comprehensive
imagery
which
distinguishes
the
modern
literature
of
england
has
not
been
as
a
general
power
the
product
of
the
imitation
of
any
particular
writer
the
mass
of
capabilities
remains
at
every
period
materially
the
same
the
circumstances
which
awaken
it
to
action
perpetually
change
if
england
were
divided
into
forty
republics
each
equal
in
population
and
extent
to
athens
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
but
that
under
institutions
not
more
perfect
than
those
of
athens
each
would
produce
philosophers
and
poets
equal
to
those
who
if
we
except
shakespeare
have
never
been
surpassed
we
owe
the
great
writers
of
the
golden
age
of
our
literature
to
that
fervid
awakening
of
the
public
mind
which
shook
to
dust
the
oldest
and
most
oppressive
form
of
the
christian
religion
we
owe
milton
to
the
progress
and
development
of
the
same
spirit
the
sacred
milton
was
let
it
ever
be
remembered
a
republican
and
a
bold
inquirer
into
morals
and
religion
the
great
writers
of
our
own
age
are
we
have
reason
to
suppose
the
companions
and
forerunners
of
some
unimagined
change
in
our
social
condition
or
the
opinions
which
cement
it
the
cloud
of
mind
is
discharging
its
collected
lightning
and
the
equilibrium
between
institutions
and
opinions
is
now
restoring
or
is
about
to
be
restored
as
to
imitation
poetry
is
a
mimetic
art
it
creates
but
it
creates
by
combination
and
representation
poetical
abstractions
are
beautiful
and
new
not
because
the
portions
of
which
they
are
composed
had
no
previous
existence
in
the
mind
of
man
or
in
nature
but
because
the
whole
produced
by
their
combination
has
some
intelligible
and
beautiful
analogy
with
those
sources
of
emotion
and
thought
and
with
the
contemporary
condition
of
them
one
great
poet
is
a
masterpiece
of
nature
which
another
not
only
ought
to
study
but
must
study
he
might
as
wisely
and
as
easily
determine
that
his
mind
should
no
longer
be
the
mirror
of
all
that
is
lovely
in
the
visible
universe
as
exclude
from
his
contemplation
the
beautiful
which
exists
in
the
writings
of
a
great
contemporary
the
pretence
of
doing
it
would
be
a
presumption
in
any
but
the
greatest
the
effect
even
in
him
would
be
strained
unnatural
and
ineffectual
a
poet
is
the
combined
product
of
such
internal
powers
as
modify
the
nature
of
others
and
of
such
external
influences
as
excite
and
sustain
these
powers
he
is
not
one
but
both
every
man
mind
is
in
this
respect
modified
by
all
the
objects
of
nature
and
art
by
every
word
and
every
suggestion
which
he
ever
admitted
to
act
upon
his
consciousness
it
is
the
mirror
upon
which
all
forms
are
reflected
and
in
which
they
compose
one
form
poets
not
otherwise
than
philosophers
painters
sculptors
and
musicians
are
in
one
sense
the
creators
and
in
another
the
creations
of
their
age
from
this
subjection
the
loftiest
do
not
escape
there
is
a
similarity
between
homer
and
hesiod
between
aeschylus
and
euripides
between
virgil
and
horace
between
dante
and
petrarch
between
shakespeare
and
fletcher
between
dryden
and
pope
each
has
a
generic
resemblance
under
which
their
specific
distinctions
are
arranged
if
this
similarity
be
the
result
of
imitation
i
am
willing
to
confess
that
i
have
imitated
let
this
opportunity
be
conceded
to
me
of
acknowledging
that
i
have
what
a
scotch
philosopher
characteristically
terms
passion
for
reforming
the
world
what
passion
incited
him
to
write
and
publish
his
book
he
omits
to
explain
for
my
part
i
had
rather
be
damned
with
plato
and
lord
bacon
than
go
to
heaven
with
paley
and
malthus
but
it
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
i
dedicate
my
poetical
compositions
solely
to
the
direct
enforcement
of
reform
or
that
i
consider
them
in
any
degree
as
containing
a
reasoned
system
on
the
theory
of
human
life
didactic
poetry
is
my
abhorrence
nothing
can
be
equally
well
expressed
in
prose
that
is
not
tedious
and
supererogatory
in
verse
my
purpose
has
hitherto
been
simply
to
familiarise
the
highly
refined
imagination
of
the
more
select
classes
of
poetical
readers
with
beautiful
idealisms
of
moral
excellence
aware
that
until
the
mind
can
love
and
admire
and
trust
and
hope
and
endure
reasoned
principles
of
moral
conduct
are
seeds
cast
upon
the
highway
of
life
which
the
unconscious
passenger
tramples
into
dust
although
they
would
bear
the
harvest
of
his
happiness
should
i
live
to
accomplish
what
i
purpose
that
is
produce
a
systematical
history
of
what
appear
to
me
to
be
the
genuine
elements
of
human
society
let
not
the
advocates
of
injustice
and
superstition
flatter
themselves
that
i
should
take
aeschylus
rather
than
plato
as
my
model
the
having
spoken
of
myself
with
unaffected
freedom
will
need
little
apology
with
the
candid
and
let
the
uncandid
consider
that
they
injure
me
less
than
their
own
hearts
and
minds
by
misrepresentation
whatever
talents
a
person
may
possess
to
amuse
and
instruct
others
be
they
ever
so
inconsiderable
he
is
yet
bound
to
exert
them
if
his
attempt
be
ineffectual
let
the
punishment
of
an
unaccomplished
purpose
have
been
sufficient
let
none
trouble
themselves
to
heap
the
dust
of
oblivion
upon
his
efforts
the
pile
they
raise
will

louder

thro
the

first
voice
from
the
mountains
thrice
three
hundred
thousand
years
the
earthquake
couch
we
stood
oft
as
men
convulsed
with
fears
we
trembled
in
our
multitude
second
voice
from
the
springs
thunderbolts
had
parched
our
water
we
had
been
stained
with
bitter
blood
and
had
run
mute
shrieks
of
slaughter
thro
a
city
and
a
solitude
third
voice
from
the
air
i
had
clothed
since
earth
uprose
its
wastes
in
colours
not
their
own
and
oft
had
my
serene
repose
been
cloven
by
many
a
rending
groan
fourth
voice
from
the
whirlwinds
we
had
soared
beneath
these
mountains
unresting
ages
nor
had
thunder
nor
yon
volcano
flaming
fountains
nor
any
power
above

under

made
us
mute
with
wonder

never
bowed
our
snowy
crest
as
at
the
voice
of
thine
unrest
second

never
such
a
sound
before
to
the
indian
waves
we
bore
a
pilot
asleep
on
the
howling
sea
leaped
up
from
the
deck
in
agony
and
heard
and
cried
woe
is
me
and
died
as
mad
as
the
wild
waves
be
third

by
such
dread
words
from
earth
to
heaven
my
still
realm
was
never
riven
when
its
wound
was
closed
there
stood
darkness
the
day
like
blood
fourth
voice
and
we
shrank
back
for
dreams
of
ruin
to
frozen
caves
our
flight
pursuing
made
us
keep
silence
thus
and
thus
though
silence
is
a
hell
to
us
the
earth
the
tongueless
caverns
of
the
craggy
hills
cried
then
the
hollow
heaven
replied
and
the
ocean
purple
waves
climbing
the
land
howled
to
the
lashing
winds
and
the
pale
nations
heard
it
note
as
hell

a

of

not
the
voice
which
i
gave
forth

thy

thou
scorn
him
without
whose
will
beneath
the
fierce
omnipotence
of
jove
both
they
and
thou
had
vanished
like
thin
mist
unrolled
on

who
made
his
agony
the
barrier
to
your

seen
athwart
frore

deep
below
through
whose
woods
i
wandered

with

drinking
life
from
her
loved
eyes
why
scorns
the
spirit
which
informs
ye
now
to
commune
with
me
me
alone
who
checked
as

who
checks
a

the
force
of
him
who
reigns

with
the
groans
of

tingles
through

joy
ran
as

thou
didst
from

arise
a
spirit
of
keen
joy

at
thy
voice
her
pining

uplifted
their
prostrate
brows
from
the
polluting
dust

our
almighty

with
fierce
dread

deeply

the

looks
white

waits
in
that
far
indian
vale
the
scene
of
her
sad
exile
rugged
once
and
desolate
and
frozen
like
this
ravine
but
now
invested
with
fair
flowers
and
herbs
and
haunted
by
sweet
airs
and
sounds
which
flow
among
the
woods
and
waters
from
the
aether
of
her
transforming
presence
which
would
fade
if
it
were
mingled
not
with

a

from

the
blasts

like
a
spirit
like
a
thought
which
makes
unwonted
tears
throng
to
the
horny
eyes
and
beatings
haunt
the
desolated
heart
which
should
have
learnt
repose
thou
hast
descended
cradled
in
tempests
thou
dost
wake
o
spring
o
child
of
many
winds
as
suddenly
thou
comest
as
the
memory
of
a
dream
which
now
is
sad
because
it
hath
been
sweet
like
genius
or
like
joy
which
riseth
up
as
from
the
earth
clothing
with
golden
clouds
the
desert
of
our
life
this
is
the
season

the
day
the
hour
at

thou
shouldst
come
sweet
sister

too
long
desired
too
long
delaying

how
like
the
wingless
moments
crawl
the
point
of
one
white
star
is
quivering
still
deep
in
the
orange
light
of
widening
morn
beyond
the
purple
mountains
through
a
chasm
of
mist
the
darker
lake
reflects
it
now
it
wanes
it
gleams
again
as
the
waves
fade
and
as
the
burning
threads
of
woven
cloud
unravel
in
pale
air
lost
and
through
yon
peaks
of
snow
the
roseate
sunlight
quivers
hear
i
not
the
aeolian
music
of
her
plumes
winnowing
the
crimson
dawn
panthea
enters
i
feel
i
see
those
eyes
which
burn
through
smiles
that
fade
in
tears
like
stars
half
quenched
in
mists
of
silver
dew
beloved
and
most
beautiful
who
wearest
the
shadow
of
that
soul
by
which
i
live
how
late
thou
art
the
sphered
sun
had
climbed
the
sea
my
heart
was
sick
with
hope
before
the
printless
air
felt
thy
belated
plumes
panthea
pardon
great
sister
but
my
wings
were
faint
with
the
delight
of
a
remembered
dream
as
are
the
noontide
plumes
of
summer
winds
satiate
with
sweet
flowers
i
was
wont
to
sleep
peacefully
and
awake
refreshed
and
calm
before
the
sacred
titan
fall
and
thy
unhappy
love
had
made
through
use
and
pity
both
love
and
woe
familiar
to
my
heart
as
they
had
grown
to
thine
erewhile
i
slept
under
the
glaucous
caverns
of
old
ocean
within
dim
bowers
of
green
and
purple
moss
our
young
ione
soft
and
milky
arms
locked
then
as
now
behind
my
dark
moist
hair
while
my
shut
eyes
and
cheek
were
pressed
within
the
folded
depth
of
her
bosom
but
not
as
now
since
i
am
made
the
wind
which
fails
beneath
the
music
that
i
bear
of
thy
most
wordless
converse
since
dissolved
into
the
sense
with
which
love
talks
my
rest
was
troubled
and
yet
sweet
my
waking
hours
too
full
of
care
and
pain
asia
lift
up
thine
eyes
and
let
me
read
thy
dream
panthea
as
i
have
said
with
our
at
his
feet
i
slept
the
mountain
mists
condensing
at
our
voice
under
the
moon
had
spread
their
snowy
flakes
from
the
keen
ice
shielding
our
linked
sleep
then
two
dreams
came
one
i
remember
not
but
in
the
other
his
pale
limbs
fell
from
prometheus
and
the
azure
night
grew
radiant
with
the
glory
of
that
form
which
lives
unchanged
within
and
his
voice
fell
like
music
which
makes
giddy
the
dim
brain
faint
with
intoxication
of
keen
joy
of
her
whose
footsteps
pave
the
world
with
loveliness
more
fair
than
aught
but
her
whose
shadow
thou
art
lift
thine
eyes
on
me
i
lifted
them
the
overpowering
light
of
that
immortal
shape
was
shadowed
by
love
which
from
his
soft
and
flowing
limbs
and
lips
and
keen
faint
eyes
steamed
forth
like
vaporous
fire
an
atmosphere
which
wrapped
me
in
its
power
as
the
warm
ether
of
the
morning
sun
wraps
ere
it
drinks
some
cloud
of
wandering
dew
i
saw
not
heard
not
moved
not
only
felt
his
presence
flow
and
mingle
through
my
blood
till
it
became
his
life
and
his
grew
mine
and
i
was
thus
absorbed
until
it
passed
and
like
the
vapours
when
the
sun
sinks
down
gathering
again
in
drops
upon
the
pines
and
tremulous
as
they
in
the
deep
night
my
being
was
condensed
and
as
the
rays
of
thought
were
slowly
gathered
i
could
hear
his
voice
whose
accents
lingered
ere
they
died
like
footsteps
of
weak
melody
thy
name
among
the
many
sounds
alone
i
heard
of
what
might
be
articulate
though
still
i
listened
through
the
night
when
sound
was
none
ione
wakened
then
and
said
to
me
thou
divine
what
troubles
me
i
always
knew
what
i
desired
before
nor
ever
found
delight
to
wish
in
vain
but
now
i
can
not
tell
thee
what
i
seek
i
know
not
something
sweet
since
it
is
sweet
even
to
desire
it
is
thy
sport
false
sister
thou
hast
discovered
some
enchantment
old
whose
spells
have
stolen
my
spirit
as
i
slept
and
mingled
it
with
thine
for
when
just
now
we
kissed
i
felt
within
thy
parted
lips
the
sweet
air
that
sustained
me
and
the
warmth
of
the
for
loss
of
which
i
faint
quivered
between
our
intertwining
arms
i
answered
not
for
the
eastern
star
grew
pale
but
fled
to
thee
asia
thou
speakest
but
thy
words
are
as
the
air
i
feel
them
not
oh
lift
thine
eyes
that
i
may
read
his
written
soul
panthea
i
lift
them
though
they
droop
beneath
the
load
of
that
they
would
express
what
canst
thou
see
but
thine
own
fairest
shadow
imaged
there
asia
thine
eyes
are
like
the
deep
blue
boundless
heaven
contracted
to
two
circles
underneath
their
long
fine
lashes
dark
far
measureless
orb

depth

there
was

wields

pierces
this

star
whose
emerald
beams
are
twined
with
its
fair
hair
how
as
it
moves
the
splendour
drops
in
flakes
upon
the
grass
knowest
thou
it
panthea
it
is
the
delicate
spirit
that
guides
the
earth
through
heaven
from
afar
the
populous
constellations
call
that
light
the
loveliest
of
the
planets
and
sometimes
it
floats
along
the
spray
of
the
salt
sea
or
makes
its
chariot
of
a
foggy
cloud
or
walks
through
fields
or
cities
while
men
sleep
or
the
mountain
tops
or
down
the
rivers
or
through
the
green
waste
wilderness
as
now
wondering
at
all
it
sees
before
jove
reigned
it
loved
our
sister
asia
and
it
came
each
leisure
hour
to
drink
the
liquid
light
out
of
her
eyes
for
which
it
said
it
thirsted
as
one
bit
by
a
dipsas
and
with
her
it
made
its
childish
confidence
and
told
her
all
it
had
known
or
seen
for
it
saw
much
yet
idly
reasoned
what
it
saw
and
called
her
for
whence
it
sprung
it
knew
not
nor
do
i
mother
dear
mother
the
spirit
of
the
earth
running
to
asia
mother
dearest
mother
may
i
then
talk
with
thee
as
i
was
wont
may
i
then
hide
my
eyes
in
thy
soft
arms
after
thy
looks
have
made
them
tired
of
joy
may
i
then
play
beside
thee
the
long
noons
when
work
is
none
in
the
bright
silent
air
asia
i
love
thee
gentlest
being
and
henceforth
can
cherish
thee
unenvied
speak
i
pray
thy
simple
talk
once
solaced
now
delights
spirit
of
the
earth
mother
i
am
grown
wiser
though
a
child
can
not
be
wise
like
thee
within
this
day
and
happier
too
happier
and
wiser
both
thou
knowest
that
toads
and
snakes
and
loathly
worms
and
venomous
and
malicious
beasts
and
boughs
that
bore
ill
berries
in
the
woods
were
ever
an
hindrance
to
my
walks
the
green
world
and
that
among
the
haunts
of
humankind
men
or
with
proud
angry
looks
or
cold
staid
gait
or
false
and
hollow
smiles
or
the
dull
sneer
of
ignorance
or
other
such
foul
masks
with
which
ill
thoughts
hide
that
fair
being
whom
we
spirits
call
man
and
women
too
ugliest
of
all
things
evil
though
fair
even
in
a
world
where
thou
art
fair
when
good
and
kind
free
and
sincere
like
thee
when
false
or
frowning
made
me
sick
at
heart
to
pass
them
though
they
slept
and
i
unseen
well
my
path
lately
lay
through
a
great
city
into
the
woody
hills
surrounding
it
a
sentinel
was
sleeping
at
the
gate
when
there
was
heard
a
sound
so
loud
it
shook
the
towers
amid
the
moonlight
yet
more
sweet
than
any
voice
but
thine
sweetest
of
all
a
long
long
sound
as
it
would
never
end
and
all
the
inhabitants
leaped
suddenly
out
of
their
rest
and
gathered
in
the
streets
looking
in
wonder
up
to
heaven
while
yet
the
music
pealed
along
i
hid
myself
within
a
fountain
in
the
public
square
where
i
lay
like
the
reflex
of
the
moon
seen
in
a
wave
under
green
leaves
and
soon
those
ugly
human
shapes
and
visages
of
which
i
spoke
as
having
wrought
me
pain
passed
floating
through
the
air
and
fading
still
into
the
winds
that
scattered
them
and
those
from
whom
they
passed
seemed
mild
and
lovely
forms
after
some
foul
disguise
had
fallen
and
all
were
somewhat
changed
and
after
brief
surprise
and
greetings
of
delighted
wonder
all
went
to
their
sleep
again
and
when
the
dawn
came
wouldst
thou
think
that
toads
and
snakes
and
efts
could
be
beautiful
yet
so
they
were
and
that
with
little
change
of
shape
or
hue
all
things
had
put
their
evil
nature
off
i
can
not
tell
my
joy
when
a
lake
upon
a
drooping
bough
with
nightshade
twined
i
saw
two
azure
halcyons
clinging
downward
and
thinning
one
bright
bunch
of
amber
berries
with
quick
long
beaks
and
in
the
deep
there
lay
those
lovely
forms
imaged
as
in
a
sky
so
with
my
thoughts
full
of
these
happy
changes
we
meet
again
the
happiest
change
of
all
asia
and
never
will
we
part
till
thy
chaste
sister
who
guides
the
frozen
and
inconstant
moon
will
look
on
thy
more
warm
and
equal
light
till
her
heart
thaw
like
flakes
of
april
snow
and
love
thee
spirit
of
the
earth
what
as
asia
loves
prometheus
asia
peace
wanton
thou
art
yet
not
old
enough
think
ye
by
gazing
on
each
other
eyes
to
multiply
your
lovely
selves
and
fill
with
sphered
fires
the
interlunar
air
spirit
of
the
earth
nay
mother
while
my
sister
trims
her
lamp
hard
i
should
go
darkling
asia
listen
look
the
spirit
of
the
hour
enters
prometheus
we
feel
what
thou
hast
heard
and
seen
yet
speak
spirit
of
the
hour
soon
as
the
sound
had
ceased
whose
thunder
filled
the
abysses
of
the
sky
and
the
wide
earth
there
was
a
change
the
impalpable
thin
air
and
the
sunlight
were
transformed
as
if
the
sense
of
love
dissolved
in
them
had
folded
itself
round
the
sphered
world
my
vision
then
grew
clear
and
i
could
see
into
the
mysteries
of
the
universe
dizzy
as
with
delight
i
floated
down
winnowing
the
lightsome
air
with
languid
plumes
my
coursers
sought
their
birthplace
in
the
sun
where
they
henceforth
will
live
exempt
from
toil
pasturing
flowers
of
vegetable
fire
and
where
my
moonlike
car
will
stand
within
a
temple
gazed
upon
by
phidian
forms
of
thee
and
asia
and
the
earth
and
me
and
you
fair
nymphs
looking
the
love
we
feel
in
memory
of
the
tidings
it
has
borne
beneath
a
dome
fretted
with
graven
flowers
poised
on
twelve
columns
of
resplendent
stone
and
open
to
the
bright
and
liquid
sky
yoked
to
it
by
an
amphisbaenic
snake
the
likeness
of
those
winged
steeds
will
mock
the
flight
from
which
they
find
repose
alas
whither
has
wandered
now
my
partial
tongue
when
all
remains
untold
which
ye
would
hear
as
i
have
said
i
floated
to
the
earth
it
was
as
it
is
still
the
pain
of
bliss
to
move
to
breathe
to
be
i
wandering
went
among
the
haunts
and
dwellings
of
mankind
and
first
was
disappointed
not
to
see
such
mighty
change
as
i
had
felt
within
expressed
in
outward
things
but
soon
i
looked
and
behold
thrones
were
kingless
and
men
walked
one
with
the
other
even
as
spirits
do
none
fawned
none
trampled
hate
disdain
or
fear
or
on
human
brows
no
more
inscribed
as
the
gate
of
hell
hope
abandon
ye
who
enter
here
none
frowned
none
trembled
none
with
eager
fear
gazed
on
another
eye
of
cold
command
until
the
subject
of
a
tyrant
will
became
worse
fate
the
abject
of
his
own
which
spurred
him
like
an
outspent
horse
to
death
none
wrought
his
lips
in
lines
which
smiled
the
lie
his
tongue
disdained
to
speak
none
with
firm
sneer
trod
out
in
his
own
heart
the
sparks
of
love
and
hope
till
there
remained
those
bitter
ashes
a
soul
and
the
wretch
crept
a
vampire
among
men
infecting
all
with
his
own
hideous
ill
none
talked
that
common
false
cold
hollow
talk
which
makes
the
heart
deny
the
yes
it
breathes
yet
question
that
unmeant
hypocrisy
with
such
a
as
has
no
name
and
women
too
frank
beautiful
and
kind
as
the
free
heaven
which
rains
fresh
light
and
dew
on
the
wide
earth
past
gentle
radiant
forms
from
custom
evil
taint
exempt
and
pure
speaking
the
wisdom
once
they
could
not
think
looking
emotions
once
they
feared
to
feel
and
changed
to
all
which
once
they
dared
not
be
yet
being
now
made
earth
like
heaven
nor
pride
nor
jealousy
nor
envy
nor
ill
shame
the
bitterest
of
those
drops
of
treasured
gall
spoiled
the
sweet
taste
of
the
nepenthe
love
thrones
altars
and
prisons
wherein
and
beside
which
by
wretched
men
were
borne
sceptres
tiaras
swords
and
chains
and
tomes
of
reasoned
wrong
glozed
on
by
ignorance
were
like
those
monstrous
and
barbaric
shapes
the
ghosts
of
a
fame
which
from
their
unworn
obelisks
look
forth
in
triumph
the
palaces
and
tombs
of
those
who
were
their
conquerors
mouldering
round
these
imaged
to
the
pride
of
kings
and
priests
a
dark
yet
mighty
faith
a
power
as
wide
as
is
the
world
it
wasted

now

an
astonishment

so
the
tools
and
emblems
of
its
last
captivity
amid
the
dwellings
of
the
peopled
earth
stand
not
but
unregarded
now
and
those
foul
shapes
abhorred
by
god
and
man
which
under
many
a
name
and
many
a
form
strange
savage
ghastly
dark
and
execrable
were
jupiter

tyrant
of
the

which
the
nations
served
with

and
hearts
broken
by
long
hope
and
love
dragged
to
his
altars
soiled
and
garlandless
and
slain
among
men
unreclaiming
tears
flattering
the

they
feared
which
fear
was
hate
frown
mouldering
fast
their
abandoned

note
on
prometheus
unbound
by
shelley
on
the
of
march
shelley
quitted
england
never
to
return
his
principal
motive
was
the
hope
that
his
health
would
be
improved
by
a
milder
climate
he
suffered
very
much
during
the
winter
previous
to
his
emigration
and
this
decided
his
vacillating
purpose
in
december
he
had
written
from
marlow
to
a
friend
saying
health
has
been
materially
worse
my
feelings
at
intervals
are
of
a
deadly
and
torpid
kind
or
awakened
to
such
a
state
of
unnatural
and
keen
excitement
that
only
to
instance
the
organ
of
sight
i
find
the
very
blades
of
grass
and
the
boughs
of
distant
trees
present
themselves
to
me
with
microscopic
distinctness
towards
evening
i
sink
into
a
state
of
lethargy
and
inanimation
and
often
remain
for
hours
on
the
sofa
between
sleep
and
waking
a
prey
to
the
most
painful
irritability
of
thought
such
with
little
intermission
is
my
condition
the
hours
devoted
to
study
are
selected
with
vigilant
caution
from
among
these
periods
of
endurance
it
is
not
for
this
that
i
think
of
travelling
to
italy
even
if
i
knew
that
italy
would
relieve
me
but
i
have
experienced
a
decisive
pulmonary
attack
and
although
at
present
it
has
passed
away
without
any
considerable
vestige
of
its
existence
yet
this
symptom
sufficiently
shows
the
true
nature
of
my
disease
to
be
consumptive
it
is
to
my
advantage
that
this
malady
is
in
its
nature
slow
and
if
one
is
sufficiently
alive
to
its
advances
is
susceptible
of
cure
from
a
warm
climate
in
the
event
of
its
assuming
any
decided
shape
it
would
be
my
duty
to
go
to
italy
without
delay
it
is
not
mere
health
but
life
that
i
should
seek
and
that
not
for
my
own
sake
i
feel
i
am
capable
of
trampling
on
all
such
weakness
but
for
the
sake
of
those
to
whom
my
life
may
be
a
source
of
happiness
utility
security
and
honour
and
to
some
of
whom
my
death
might
be
all
that
is
the
reverse
in
almost
every
respect
his
journey
to
italy
was
advantageous
he
left
behind
friends
to
whom
he
was
attached
but
cares
of
a
thousand
kinds
many
springing
from
his
lavish
generosity
crowded
round
him
in
his
native
country
and
except
the
society
of
one
or
two
friends
he
had
no
compensation
the
climate
caused
him
to
consume
half
his
existence
in
helpless
suffering
his
dearest
pleasure
the
free
enjoyment
of
the
scenes
of
nature
was
marred
by
the
same
circumstance
he
went
direct
to
italy
avoiding
even
paris
and
did
not
make
any
pause
till
he
arrived
at
milan
the
first
aspect
of
italy
enchanted
shelley
it
seemed
a
garden
of
delight
placed
beneath
a
clearer
and
brighter
heaven
than
any
he
had
lived
under
before
he
wrote
long
descriptive
letters
during
the
first
year
of
his
residence
in
italy
which
as
compositions
are
the
most
beautiful
in
the
world
and
show
how
truly
he
appreciated
and
studied
the
wonders
of
nature
and
art
in
that
divine
land
the
poetical
spirit
within
him
speedily
revived
with
all
the
power
and
with
more
than
all
the
beauty
of
his
first
attempts
he
meditated
three
subjects
as
the
groundwork
for
lyrical
dramas
one
was
the
story
of
tasso
of
this
a
slight
fragment
of
a
song
of
tasso
remains
the
other
was
one
founded
on
the
book
of
job
which
he
never
abandoned
in
idea
but
of
which
no
trace
remains
among
his
papers
the
third
was
the
prometheus
unbound
the
greek
tragedians
were
now
his
most
familiar
companions
in
his
wanderings
and
the
sublime
majesty
of
aeschylus
filled
him
with
wonder
and
delight
the
father
of
greek
tragedy
does
not
possess
the
pathos
of
sophocles
nor
the
variety
and
tenderness
of
euripides
the
interest
on
which
he
founds
his
dramas
is
often
elevated
above
human
vicissitudes
into
the
mighty
passions
and
throes
of
gods
and
such
fascinated
the
abstract
imagination
of
shelley
we
spent
a
month
at
milan
visiting
the
lake
of
como
during
that
interval
thence
we
passed
in
succession
to
pisa
leghorn
the
baths
of
lucca
venice
este
rome
naples
and
back
again
to
rome
whither
we
returned
early
in
march
during
all
this
time
shelley
meditated
the
subject
of
his
drama
and
wrote
portions
of
it
other
poems
were
composed
during
this
interval
and
while
at
the
bagni
di
lucca
he
translated
plato
symposium
but
though
he
diversified
his
studies
his
thoughts
centred
in
the
prometheus
at
last
when
at
rome
during
a
bright
and
beautiful
spring
he
gave
up
his
whole
time
to
the
composition
the
spot
selected
for
his
study
was
as
he
mentions
in
his
preface
the
mountainous
ruins
of
the
baths
of
caracalla
these
are
little
known
to
the
ordinary
visitor
at
rome
he
describes
them
in
a
letter
with
that
poetry
and
delicacy
and
truth
of
description
which
render
his
narrated
impressions
of
scenery
of
unequalled
beauty
and
interest
at
first
he
completed
the
drama
in
three
acts
it
was
not
till
several
months
after
when
at
florence
that
he
conceived
that
a
fourth
act
a
sort
of
hymn
of
rejoicing
in
the
fulfilment
of
the
prophecies
with
regard
to
prometheus
ought
to
be
added
to
complete
the
composition
the
prominent
feature
of
shelley
theory
of
the
destiny
of
the
human
species
was
that
evil
is
not
inherent
in
the
system
of
the
creation
but
an
accident
that
might
be
expelled
this
also
forms
a
portion
of
christianity
god
made
earth
and
man
perfect
till
he
by
his
fall
death
into
the
world
and
all
our
woe
shelley
believed
that
mankind
had
only
to
will
that
there
should
be
no
evil
and
there
would
be
none
it
is
not
my
part
in
these
notes
to
notice
the
arguments
that
have
been
urged
against
this
opinion
but
to
mention
the
fact
that
he
entertained
it
and
was
indeed
attached
to
it
with
fervent
enthusiasm
that
man
could
be
so
perfectionized
as
to
be
able
to
expel
evil
from
his
own
nature
and
from
the
greater
part
of
the
creation
was
the
cardinal
point
of
his
system
and
the
subject
he
loved
best
to
dwell
on
was
the
image
of
one
warring
with
the
evil
principle
oppressed
not
only
by
it
but
by
all
even
the
good
who
were
deluded
into
considering
evil
a
necessary
portion
of
humanity
a
victim
full
of
fortitude
and
hope
and
the
spirit
of
triumph
emanating
from
a
reliance
in
the
ultimate
omnipotence
of
good
such
he
had
depicted
in
his
last
poem
when
he
made
laon
the
enemy
and
the
victim
of
tyrants
he
now
took
a
more
idealized
image
of
the
same
subject
he
followed
certain
classical
authorities
in
figuring
saturn
as
the
good
principle
jupiter
the
usurping
evil
one
and
prometheus
as
the
regenerator
who
unable
to
bring
mankind
back
to
primitive
innocence
used
knowledge
as
a
weapon
to
defeat
evil
by
leading
mankind
beyond
the
state
wherein
they
are
sinless
through
ignorance
to
that
in
which
they
are
virtuous
through
wisdom
jupiter
punished
the
temerity
of
the
titan
by
chaining
him
to
a
rock
of
caucasus
and
causing
a
vulture
to
devour
his
heart
there
was
a
prophecy
afloat
in
heaven
portending
the
fall
of
jove
the
secret
of
averting
which
was
known
only
to
prometheus
and
the
god
offered
freedom
from
torture
on
condition
of
its
being
communicated
to
him
according
to
the
mythological
story
this
referred
to
the
offspring
of
thetis
who
was
destined
to
be
greater
than
his
father
prometheus
at
last
bought
pardon
for
his
crime
of
enriching
mankind
with
his
gifts
by
revealing
the
prophecy
hercules
killed
the
vulture
and
set
him
free
and
thetis
was
married
to
peleus
the
father
of
achilles
shelley
adapted
the
catastrophe
of
this
story
to
his
peculiar
views
the
son
greater
than
his
father
born
of
the
nuptials
of
jupiter
and
thetis
was
to
dethrone
evil
and
bring
back
a
happier
reign
than
that
of
saturn
prometheus
defies
the
power
of
his
enemy
and
endures
centuries
of
torture
till
the
hour
arrives
when
jove
blind
to
the
real
event
but
darkly
guessing
that
some
great
good
to
himself
will
flow
espouses
thetis
at
the
moment
the
primal
power
of
the
world
drives
him
from
his
usurped
throne
and
strength
in
the
person
of
hercules
liberates
humanity
typified
in
prometheus
from
the
tortures
generated
by
evil
done
or
suffered
asia
one
of
the
oceanides
is
the
wife
of
prometheus
she
was
according
to
other
mythological
interpretations
the
same
as
venus
and
nature
when
the
benefactor
of
mankind
is
liberated
nature
resumes
the
beauty
of
her
prime
and
is
united
to
her
husband
the
emblem
of
the
human
race
in
perfect
and
happy
union
in
the
fourth
act
the
poet
gives
further
scope
to
his
imagination
and
idealizes
the
forms
of
creation
such
as
we
know
them
instead
of
such
as
they
appeared
to
the
greeks
maternal
earth
the
mighty
parent
is
superseded
by
the
spirit
of
the
earth
the
guide
of
our
planet
through
the
realms
of
sky
while
his
fair
and
weaker
companion
and
attendant
the
spirit
of
the
moon
receives
bliss
from
the
annihilation
of
evil
in
the
superior
sphere
shelley
develops
more
particularly
in
the
lyrics
of
this
drama
his
abstruse
and
imaginative
theories
with
regard
to
the
creation
it
requires
a
mind
as
subtle
and
penetrating
as
his
own
to
understand
the
mystic
meanings
scattered
throughout
the
poem
they
elude
the
ordinary
reader
by
their
abstraction
and
delicacy
of
distinction
but
they
are
far
from
vague
it
was
his
design
to
write
prose
metaphysical
essays
on
the
nature
of
man
which
would
have
served
to
explain
much
of
what
is
obscure
in
his
poetry
a
few
scattered
fragments
of
observations
and
remarks
alone
remain
he
considered
these
philosophical
views
of
mind
and
nature
to
be
instinct
with
the
intensest
spirit
of
poetry
more
popular
poets
clothe
the
ideal
with
familiar
and
sensible
imagery
shelley
loved
to
idealize
the
real
to
gift
the
mechanism
of
the
material
universe
with
a
soul
and
a
voice
and
to
bestow
such
also
on
the
most
delicate
and
abstract
emotions
and
thoughts
of
the
mind
sophocles
was
his
great
master
in
this
species
of
imagery
i
find
in
one
of
his
manuscript
books
some
remarks
on
a
line
in
the
oedipus
tyrannus
which
show
at
once
the
critical
subtlety
of
shelley
mind
and
explain
his
apprehension
of
those
and
remote
distinctions
of
feeling
whether
relative
to
external
nature
or
the
living
beings
which
surround
us
which
he

in

the
greek
shakespeare
sophocles
we
find
the
image
pollas
d
odous
elthonta
phrontidos
planois
a
line
of
almost
unfathomable
depth
of
poetry
yet
how
simple
are
the
images
in
which
it
is
arrayed
coming
to
many
ways
in
the
wanderings
of
careful
thought
if
the
words
odous
and
planois
had
not
been
used
the
line
might
have
been
explained
in
a
metaphorical
instead
of
an
absolute
sense
as
we
say
ways
and
means
and
wanderings
for
error
and
confusion
but
they
meant
literally
paths
or
roads
such
as
we
tread
with
our
feet
and
wanderings
such
as
a
man
makes
when
he
loses
himself
in
a
desert
or
roams
from
city
to
city
as
oedipus
the
speaker
of
this
verse
was
destined
to
wander
blind
and
asking
charity
what
a
picture
does
this
line
suggest
of
the
mind
as
a
wilderness
of
intricate
paths
wide
as
the
universe
which
is
here
made
its
symbol
a
world
within
a
world
which
he
who
seeks
some
knowledge
with
respect
to
what
he
ought
to
do
searches
throughout
as
he
would
search
the
external
universe
for
some
valued
thing
which
was
hidden
from
him
upon
its
surface
in
reading
shelley
poetry
we
often
find
similar
verses
resembling
but
not
imitating
the
greek
in
this
species
of
imagery
for
though
he
adopted
the
style
he
gifted
it
with
that
originality
of
form
and
colouring
which
sprung
from
his
own
genius
in
the
prometheus
unbound
shelley
fulfils
the
promise
quoted
from
a
letter
in
the
note
on
the
revolt
of
islam
while
correcting
the
of
that
poem
it
struck
me
that
the
poet
had
indulged
in
an
exaggerated
view
of
the
evils
of
restored
despotism
which
however
injurious
and
degrading
were
less
openly
sanguinary
than
the
triumph
of
anarchy
such
as
it
appeared
in
france
at
the
close
of
the
last
century
but
at
this
time
a
book
scenes
of
spanish
life
translated
by
lieutenant
crawford
from
the
german
of
huber
of
rostock
fell
into
my
hands
the
account
of
the
triumph
of
the
priests
and
the
serviles
after
the
french
invasion
of
spain
in
bears
a
strong
and
frightful
resemblance
to
some
of
the
descriptions
of
the
massacre
of
the
patriots
in
the
revolt
of
islam
the
tone
of
the
composition
is
calmer
and
more
majestic
the
poetry
more
perfect
as
a
whole
and
the
imagination
displayed
at
once
more
pleasingly
beautiful
and
more
varied
and
daring
the
description
of
the
hours
as
they
are
seen
in
the
cave
of
demogorgon
is
an
instance
of
this
it
fills
the
mind
as
the
most
charming
picture
we
long
to
see
an
artist
at
work
to
bring
to
our
view
the
drawn
by
steeds
which
trample
the
dim
winds
in
each
there
stands
a
charioteer
urging
their
flight
some
look
behind
as
fiends
pursued
them
there
and
yet
i
see
no
shapes
but
the
keen
stars
others
with
burning
eyes
lean
forth
and
drink
with
eager
lips
the
wind
of
their
own
speed
as
if
the
thing
they
loved
fled
on
before
and
now
even
now
they
clasped
it
their
bright
locks
stream
like
a
comet
flashing
hair
they
all
sweep
onward
through
the
whole
poem
there
reigns
a
sort
of
calm
and
holy
spirit
of
love
it
soothes
the
tortured
and
is
hope
to
the
expectant
till
the
prophecy
is
fulfilled
and
love
untainted
by
any
evil
becomes
the
law
of
the
world
england
had
been
rendered
a
painful
residence
to
shelley
as
much
by
the
sort
of
persecution
with
which
in
those
days
all
men
of
liberal
opinions
were
visited
and
by
the
injustice
he
had
lately
endured
in
the
court
of
chancery
as
by
the
symptoms
of
disease
which
made
him
regard
a
visit
to
italy
as
necessary
to
prolong
his
life
an
exile
and
strongly
impressed
with
the
feeling
that
the
majority
of
his
countrymen
regarded
him
with
sentiments
of
aversion
such
as
his
own
heart
could
experience
towards
none
he
sheltered
himself
from
such
disgusting
and
painful
thoughts
in
the
calm
retreats
of
poetry
and
built
up
a
world
of
his
own
with
the
more
pleasure
since
he
hoped
to
induce
some
one
or
two
to
believe
that
the
earth
might
become
such
did
mankind
themselves
consent
the
charm
of
the
roman
climate
helped
to
clothe
his
thoughts
in
greater
beauty
than
they
had
ever
worn
before
and
as
he
wandered
among
the
ruins
made
one
with
nature
in
their
decay

gazed
on
the
praxitelean
shapes
that
throng

his

of

which
became

show
the
intense
delight
he
received
from
such
studies
and

impression
with
a
beauty

years
this
the

those

which

just
i
can
also
perceive
in
them
the
literary
defects
incidental
to

are
dreams
of
what

which
i

rome
may
the
cenci
preface
a
manuscript
was
communicated
to
me
during
my
travels
in
italy
which
was
copied
from
the
archives
of
the
cenci
palace
at
rome
and
contains
a
detailed
account
of
the
horrors
which
ended
in
the
extinction
of
one
of
the
noblest
and
richest
families
of
that
city
during
the
pontificate
of
clement
viii
in
the
year
the
story
is
that
an
old
man
having
spent
his
life
in
debauchery
and
wickedness
conceived
at
length
an
implacable
hatred
towards
his
children
which
showed
itself
towards
one
daughter
under
the
form
of
an
incestuous
passion
aggravated
by
every
circumstance
of
cruelty
and
violence
this
daughter
after
long
and
vain
attempts
to
escape
from
what
she
considered
a
perpetual
contamination
both
of
body
and
mind
at
length
plotted
with
her
and
brother
to
murder
their
common
tyrant
the
young
maiden
who
was
urged
to
this
tremendous
deed
by
an
impulse
which
overpowered
its
horror
was
evidently
a
most
gentle
and
amiable
being
a
creature
formed
to
adorn
and
be
admired
and
thus
violently
thwarted
from
her
nature
by
the
necessity
of
circumstance
and
opinion
the
deed
was
quickly
discovered
and
in
spite
of
the
most
earnest
prayers
made
to
the
pope
by
the
highest
persons
in
rome
the
criminals
were
put
to
death
the
old
man
had
during
his
life
repeatedly
bought
his
pardon
from
the
pope
for
capital
crimes
of
the
most
enormous
and
unspeakable
kind
at
the
price
of
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
the
death
therefore
of
his
victims
can
scarcely
be
accounted
for
by
the
love
of
justice
the
pope
among
other
motives
for
severity
probably
felt
that
whoever
killed
the
count
cenci
deprived
his
treasury
of
a
certain
and
copious
source
of
revenue
the
papal
government
formerly
took
the
most
extraordinary
precautions
against
the
publicity
of
facts
which
offer
so
tragical
a
demonstration
of
its
own
wickedness
and
weakness
so
that
the
communication
of
the
manuscript
had
become
until
very
lately
a
matter
of
some
difficulty
such
a
story
if
told
so
as
to
present
to
the
reader
all
the
feelings
of
those
who
once
acted
it
their
hopes
and
fears
their
confidences
and
misgivings
their
various
interests
passions
and
opinions
acting
upon
and
with
each
other
yet
all
conspiring
to
one
tremendous
end
would
be
as
a
light
to
make
apparent
some
of
the
most
dark
and
secret
caverns
of
the
human
heart
on
my
arrival
at
rome
i
found
that
the
story
of
the
cenci
was
a
subject
not
to
be
mentioned
in
italian
society
without
awakening
a
deep
and
breathless
interest
and
that
the
feelings
of
the
company
never
failed
to
incline
to
a
romantic
pity
for
the
wrongs
and
a
passionate
exculpation
of
the
horrible
deed
to
which
they
urged
her
who
has
been
mingled
two
centuries
with
the
common
dust
all
ranks
of
people
knew
the
outlines
of
this
history
and
participated
in
the
overwhelming
interest
which
it
seems
to
have
the
magic
of
exciting
in
the
human
heart
i
had
a
copy
of
guido
picture
of
beatrice
which
is
preserved
in
the
colonna
palace
and
my
servant
instantly
recognized
it
as
the
portrait
of
la
cenci
this
national
and
universal
interest
which
the
story
produces
and
has
produced
for
two
centuries
and
among
all
ranks
of
people
in
a
great
city
where
the
imagination
is
kept
for
ever
active
and
awake
first
suggested
to
me
the
conception
of
its
fitness
for
a
dramatic
purpose
in
fact
it
is
a
tragedy
which
has
already
received
from
its
capacity
of
awakening
and
sustaining
the
sympathy
of
men
approbation
and
success
nothing
remained
as
i
imagined
but
to
clothe
it
to
the
apprehensions
of
my
countrymen
in
such
language
and
action
as
would
bring
it
home
to
their
hearts
the
deepest
and
the
sublimest
tragic
compositions
king
lear
and
the
two
plays
in
which
the
tale
of
oedipus
is
told
were
stories
which
already
existed
in
tradition
as
matters
of
popular
belief
and
interest
before
shakspeare
and
sophocles
made
them
familiar
to
the
sympathy
of
all
succeeding
generations
of
mankind
this
story
of
the
cenci
is
indeed
eminently
fearful
and
monstrous
anything
like
a
dry
exhibition
of
it
on
the
stage
would
be
insupportable
the
person
who
would
treat
such
a
subject
must
increase
the
ideal
and
diminish
the
actual
horror
of
the
events
so
that
the
pleasure
which
arises
from
the
poetry
which
exists
in
these
tempestuous
sufferings
and
crimes
may
mitigate
the
pain
of
the
contemplation
of
the
moral
deformity
from
which
they
spring
there
must
also
be
nothing
attempted
to
make
the
exhibition
subservient
to
what
is
vulgarly
termed
a
moral
purpose
the
highest
moral
purpose
aimed
at
in
the
highest
species
of
the
drama
is
the
teaching
the
human
heart
through
its
sympathies
and
antipathies
the
knowledge
of
itself
in
proportion
to
the
possession
of
which
knowledge
every
human
being
is
wise
just
sincere
tolerant
and
kind
if
dogmas
can
do
more
it
is
well
but
a
drama
is
no
fit
place
for
the
enforcement
of
them
undoubtedly
no
person
can
be
truly
dishonoured
by
the
act
of
another
and
the
fit
return
to
make
to
the
most
enormous
injuries
is
kindness
and
forbearance
and
a
resolution
to
convert
the
injurer
from
his
dark
passions
by
peace
and
love
revenge
retaliation
atonement
are
pernicious
mistakes
if
beatrice
had
thought
in
this
manner
she
would
have
been
wiser
and
better
but
she
would
never
have
been
a
tragic
character
the
few
whom
such
an
exhibition
would
have
interested
could
never
have
been
sufficiently
interested
for
a
dramatic
purpose
from
the
want
of
finding
sympathy
in
their
interest
among
the
mass
who
surround
them
it
is
in
the
restless
and
anatomizing
casuistry
with
which
men
seek
the
justification
of
beatrice
yet
feel
that
she
has
done
what
needs
justification
it
is
in
the
superstitious
horror
with
which
they
contemplate
alike
her
wrongs
and
their
revenge
that
the
dramatic
character
of
what
she
did
and
suffered
consists
i
have
endeavoured
as
nearly
as
possible
to
represent
the
characters
as
they
probably
were
and
have
sought
to
avoid
the
error
of
making
them
actuated
by
my
own
conceptions
of
right
or
wrong
false
or
true
thus
under
a
thin
veil
converting
names
and
actions
of
the
sixteenth
century
into
cold
impersonations
of
my
own
mind
they
are
represented
as
catholics
and
as
catholics
deeply
tinged
with
religion
to
a
protestant
apprehension
there
will
appear
something
unnatural
in
the
earnest
and
perpetual
sentiment
of
the
relations
between
god
and
men
which
pervade
the
tragedy
of
the
cenci
it
will
especially
be
startled
at
the
combination
of
an
undoubting
persuasion
of
the
truth
of
the
popular
religion
with
a
cool
and
determined
perseverance
in
enormous
guilt
but
religion
in
italy
is
not
as
in
protestant
countries
a
cloak
to
be
worn
on
particular
days
or
a
passport
which
those
who
do
not
wish
to
be
railed
at
carry
with
them
to
exhibit
or
a
gloomy
passion
for
penetrating
the
impenetrable
mysteries
of
our
being
which
terrifies
its
possessor
at
the
darkness
of
the
abyss
to
the
brink
of
which
it
has
conducted
him
religion
coexists
as
it
were
in
the
mind
of
an
italian
catholic
with
a
faith
in
that
of
which
all
men
have
the
most
certain
knowledge
it
is
interwoven
with
the
whole
fabric
of
life
it
is
adoration
faith
submission
penitence
blind
admiration
not
a
rule
for
moral
conduct
it
has
no
necessary
connection
with
any
one
virtue
the
most
atrocious
villain
may
be
rigidly
devout
and
without
any
shock
to
established
faith
confess
himself
to
be
so
religion
pervades
intensely
the
whole
frame
of
society
and
is
according
to
the
temper
of
the
mind
which
it
inhabits
a
passion
a
persuasion
an
excuse
a
refuge

a

expostulation
with
cenci
after
having
administered
the
opiate
was
to
induce
him
by
a
feigned
tale
to
confess
himself
before
death
this
being
esteemed
by
catholics
as
essential
to
salvation
and
she
only
relinquishes
her
purpose
when
she
perceives
that
her
perseverance
would
expose
beatrice
to
new
outrages
i
have
avoided
with
great
care
in
writing
this
play
the
introduction
of
what
is
commonly
called
mere
poetry
and
i
imagine
there
will
scarcely
be
found
a
detached
simile
or
a
single
isolated
description
unless
beatrice
description
of
the
chasm
appointed
for
her
murder
should
be
judged
to
be
of
that
nature
an
idea
in
this
speech
was
suggested
by
a
most
sublime
passage
in
el
purgaterio
de
san
patricio
of
calderon
the
only
plagiarism
which
i
have
intentionally
committed
in
the
whole
piece
in
a
dramatic
composition
the
imagery
and
the
passion
should
interpenetrate
one
another
the
former
being
reserved
simply
for
the
full
development
and
illustration
of
the
latter
imagination
is
as
the
immortal
god
which
should
assume
flesh
for
the
redemption
of
mortal
passion
it
is
thus
that
the
most
remote
and
the
most
familiar
imagery
may
alike
be
fit
for
dramatic
purposes
when
employed
in
the
illustration
of
strong
feeling
which
raises
what
is
low
and
levels
to
the
apprehension
that
which
is
lofty
casting
over
all
the
shadow
of
its
own
greatness
in
other
respects
i
have
written
more
carelessly
that
is
without
an
and
learned
choice
of
words
in
this
respect
i
entirely
agree
with
those
modern
critics
who
assert
that
in
order
to
move
men
to
true
sympathy
we
must
use
the
familiar
language
of
men
and
that
our
great
ancestors
the
ancient
english
poets
are
the
writers
a
study
of
whom
might
incite
us
to
do
that
for
our
own
age
which
they
have
done
for
theirs
but
it
must
be
the
real
language
of
men
in
general
and
not
that
of
any
particular
class
to
whose
society
the
writer
happens
to
belong
so
much
for
what
i
have
attempted
i
need
not
be
assured
that
success
is
a
very
different
matter
particularly
for
one
whose
attention
has
but
newly
been
awakened
to
the
study
of
dramatic
literature
i
endeavoured
whilst
at
rome
to
observe
such
monuments
of
this
story
as
might
be
accessible
to
a
stranger
the
portrait
of
beatrice
at
the
colonna
palace
is
admirable
as
a
work
of
art
it
was
taken
by
guido
during
her
confinement
in
prison
but
it
is
most
interesting
as
a
just
representation
of
one
of
the
loveliest
specimens
of
the
workmanship
of
nature
there
is
a
fixed
and
pale
composure
upon
the
features
she
seems
sad
and
stricken
down
in
spirit
yet
the
despair
thus
expressed
is
lightened
by
the
patience
of
gentleness
her
head
is
bound
with
folds
of
white
drapery
from
which
the
yellow
strings
of
her
golden
hair
escape
and
fall
about
her
neck
the
moulding
of
her
face
is
exquisitely
delicate
the
eyebrows
are
distinct
and
arched
the
lips
have
that
permanent
meaning
of
imagination
and
sensibility
which
suffering
has
not
repressed
and
which
it
seems
as
if
death
scarcely
could
extinguish
her
forehead
is
large
and
clear
her
eyes
which
we
are
told
were
remarkable
for
their
vivacity
are
swollen
with
weeping
and
lustreless
but
beautifully
tender
and
serene
in
the
whole
mien
there
is
a
simplicity
and
dignity
which
united
with
her
exquisite
loveliness
and
deep
sorrow
are
inexpressibly
pathetic
beatrice
cenci
appears
to
have
been
one
of
those
rare
persons
in
whom
energy
and
gentleness
dwell
together
without
destroying
one
another
her
nature
was
simple
and
profound
the
crimes
and
miseries
in
which
she
was
an
actor
and
a
sufferer
are
as
the
mask
and
the
mantle
in
which
circumstances
clothed
her
for
her
impersonation
on
the
scene
of
the
world
the
cenci
palace
is
of
great
extent
and
though
in
part
modernized
there
yet
remains
a
vast
and
gloomy
pile
of
feudal
architecture
in
the
same
state
as
during
the
dreadful
scenes
which
are
the
subject
of
this
tragedy
the
palace
is
situated
in
an
obscure
corner
of
rome
near
the
quarter
of
the
jews
and
from
the
upper
windows
you
see
the
immense
ruins
of
mount
palatine
half
hidden
under
their
profuse
overgrowth
of
trees
there
is
a
court
in
one
part
of
the
palace
perhaps
that
in
which
cenci
built
the
chapel
to
thomas
supported
by
granite
columns
and
adorned
with
antique
friezes
of
fine
workmanship
and
built
up
according
to
the
ancient
italian
fashion
with
balcony
over
balcony
of
one
of
the
gates
of
the
palace
formed
of
immense
stones
and
leading
through
a
passage
dark
and
lofty
and
opening
into
gloomy
subterranean
chambers
struck
me
particularly
of
the
castle
of

could
obtain
no
further

that
the

the

cenci
the

it

ay
i
once
heard
the
nephew
of
the

had
sent
his
architect
to
view
the
ground
meaning
to
build
a
villa
on
my
vines
the
next
time
i
compounded
with
his
uncle
i
little
thought
he
should
outwit
me
so
henceforth
no
witness
not
the
lamp
shall
see
that
which
the
vassal
threatened
to
divulge
whose
throat
is
choked
with
dust
for
his
reward
the
deed
he
saw
could
not
have
rated
higher
than
his
most
worthless
life
it
angers
me
respited
me
from
hell
so
may
the
devil
respite
their
souls
from

no
doubt
pope
clement
and
his
most
charitable
nephews
pray
that
the
apostle
peter

the

will
grant
for

i
long

much
that
thou

with

hideously
look
deeds

through

white

venerable

your

should
be
sitting
round
you
now
but
that
you
fear
to
read
upon
their

the
shame
and
misery
you
have
written
there
where
is
your
wife
where
is
your
gentle
daughter
methinks
her
sweet
looks
which
make
all
things
else
beauteous
and
glad
might
kill
the
fiend
within
you
why
is
she
barred
from
all
society
but
her
own
strange
and
uncomplaining
wrongs
talk
with
me
count
you
know
i
mean
you
well
i
stood
beside
your
dark
and
fiery
youth
watching
its
bold
and
bad
career
as
men
watch
meteors
but
it
vanished
not
i
marked
your
desperate
and
remorseless
manhood
now
do
i
behold
you
in
dishonoured
age
charged
with
a
thousand
unrepented
crimes
yet
i
have
ever
hoped
you
would
amend
and
in
that
hope
have
saved
your
life
three
times
cenci
for
which
aldobrandino
owes
you
now
my
fief
beyond
the
cardinal
one
thing
i
pray
you
recollect
henceforth
and
so
we
shall
converse
with
less
restraint
a
man
you
knew
spoke
of
my
wife
and
daughter
he
was
accustomed
to
frequent
my
house
so
the
next
day
his
wife
and
daughter
came
and
asked
if
i
had
seen
him
and
i
smiled
i
think
they
never
saw
him
any
more
camillo
thou
execrable
man
beware
cenci
of
thee
nay
this
is
idle
we
should
know
each
other
as
to
my
character
for
what
men
call
crime
seeing
i
please
my
senses
as
i
list
and
vindicate
that
right
with
force
or
guile
it
is
a
public
matter
and
i
care
not
if
i
discuss
it
with
you
i
may
speak
alike
to
you
and
my
own
conscious
heart
for
you
give
out
that
you
have
half
reformed
me
therefore
strong
vanity
will
keep
you
silent
if
fear

not
both
will
i
do
not
doubt
all
men
delight
in
sensual
luxury
all
men
enjoy
revenge
and
most
exult
over
the
tortures
they
can
never
feel
flattering
their
secret
peace
with
others
pain
but
i
delight
in
nothing
else
i
love
the
sight
of
agony
and
the
sense
of
joy
when
this
shall
be
another
and
that
mine
and
i
have
no
remorse
and
little
fear
which
are
i
think
the
checks
of
other
men
this
mood
has
grown
upon
me
until
now
any
design
my
captious
fancy
makes
the

its

it
forms
none

alas
orsino
all
the
love
that
once
i
felt
for
you
is
turned
to
bitter
pain
ours
was
a
youthful
contract
which
you
first
broke
by
assuming
vows
no
pope
will
loose
and
thus
i
love
you
still

holily
even

i
swear
a
cold

from

from

with
this
outward
show
of
love
he
mocks
his
inward
hate
is
bold
hypocrisy
for

would
gladlier
celebrate
their
deaths

him
pray
for

eloquent

bestow
her
on
some
poor
relation
of
his

her

debarred

live
a

as
to
wine

women

with
a
peevish
temper
may
return
to
a
dull
home

rest

what

suddenly
beyond

this
golden
bowl
under
the
lamplight
as
my
spirits
do
to
hear
the
death
of
my
accursed
sons
could
i
believe
thou
wert
their
mingled
blood
then
would
i
taste
thee
like
a
sacrament
and
pledge
with
thee
the
mighty
devil
in
hell
who
if
a
father
curses
as
men
say
climb
with
swift
wings
after
their
children
souls
and
drag
them
from
the
very
throne
of
heaven
now
triumphs
in
my
triumph
but
thou
art
superfluous
i
have
drunken
deep
of
joy

i
will
taste
no

of

do
entreat
you
go
not
noble
guests
what
although
tyranny
and
impious
hate
stand
sheltered
by
a
father
hoary
hair
what
if
is
he
who
clothed
us
in
these
limbs
who
tortures
them
and
triumphs
what
if
we
the
desolate
and
the
dead
were
his
own
flesh
his
children
and
his
wife
whom
he
is
bound
to
love
and
shelter
shall
we
therefore
find
no
refuge
in
this
merciless
wide
world
o
think
what
deep
wrongs
must
have
blotted
out
first
love
then
reverence
in
a
child
prone
mind
till
it
thus
vanquish
shame
and
fear
o
think
i
have
borne
much
and
kissed
the
sacred
hand
which
crushed
us
to
the
earth
and
thought
its
stroke
was
perhaps
some
paternal
chastisement
have
excused
much
doubted
and
when
no
doubt
remained
have
sought
by
patience
love
and
tears
to
soften
him
and
when
this
could
not
be
i
have
knelt
down
through
the
long
sleepless
nights
and
lifted
up
to
god
the
father
of
all
passionate
prayers
and
when
these
were
not
heard
i
have
still
borne
until
i
meet
you
here
princes
and
kinsmen
at
this
hideous
feast
given
at
my
brothers
deaths
two
yet
remain
his
wife
remains
and
i
whom
if
ye
save
not
ye
may
soon
share
such
merriment

my
good
friends
here
will
think
of
their
own

perhaps
of
their
own
throats

enter
a

almighty

my

bids

the

demands
at
what
hour
secure

mary
exit
servant
so
daughter
our
last
hope
has
failed
ah
me
how
pale
you
look
you
tremble
and
you
stand
wrapped
in
some
fixed
and
fearful
meditation
as
if
one
thought
were
over
strong
for
you
your
eyes
have
a
chill
glare
o
dearest
child
are
you
gone
mad
if
not
pray
speak
to
me
beatrice
you
see
i
am
not
mad
i
speak
to
you
lucretia
you
talked
of
something
that
your
father
did
after
that
dreadful
feast
could
it
be
worse
than
when
he
smiled
and
cried
sons
are
dead
and
every
one
looked
in
his
neighbour
face
to
see
if
others
were
as
white
as
he
at
the
first
word
he
spoke
i
felt
the
blood
rush
to
my
heart
and
fell
into
a
trance
and
when
it
passed
i
sat
all
weak
and
wild
whilst
you
alone
stood
up
and
with
strong
words
checked
his
unnatural
pride
and
i
could
see
the
devil
was
rebuked
that
lives
in
him
until
this
hour
thus
you
have
ever
stood
between
us
and
your
father
moody
wrath
like
a
protecting
presence
your
firm
mind
has
been
our
only
refuge
and
defence
what
can
have
thus
subdued
it
what
can
now
have
given
you
that
cold
melancholy
look
succeeding
to
your
unaccustomed
fear
beatrice
what
is
it
that
you
say
i
was
just
thinking
better
not
to
struggle
any
more
men
like
my
father
have
been
dark
and
bloody
yet
never
oh
before
worse
comes
of
it
wise
to
die
it
ends
in
that
at
last
lucretia
oh
talk
not
so
dear
child
tell
me
at
once
what
did
your
father
do
or
say
to
you
he
stayed
not
after
that
accursed
feast
one
moment
in
your
speak
to
me
bernardo
oh
sister
sister
prithee
speak
to
us
beatrice
speaking
very
slowly
with
a
forced
calmness
it
was
one
word
mother
one
little
word
one
look
one
smile
wildly
oh
he
has
trampled
me
under
his
feet
and
made
the
blood
stream
down
my
pallid
cheeks
and
he
has
given
us
all
and
the
flesh
of
buffaloes
and
bade
us
eat
or
starve
and
we
have
he
has
made
me
look
on
my
beloved
bernardo
when
the
rust
of
heavy
chains
has
gangrened
his
sweet
limbs
and
i
have
never
yet
despaired
but
now
what
could
i
say
recovering
herself
ah
no
is
nothing
new
the
sufferings
we
all
share
have
made
me
wild
he
only
struck
and
cursed
me
as
he
passed
he
said
he
looked
he
did
nothing
at
all
beyond
his
wont
yet
it
disordered
me
alas
i
am
forgetful
of
my
duty
i
should
preserve
my
senses
for
your
sake
lucretia
nay
beatrice
have
courage
my
sweet
girl
if
any
one
despairs
it
should
be
i
who
loved
him
once
and
now
must
live
with
him
till
god
in
pity
call
for
him
or
me
for
you
may
like
your
sister
find
some
husband
and
smile
years
hence
with
children
round
your
knees
whilst
i
then
dead
and
all
this
hideous
coil
shall
be
remembered
only
as
a
dream
beatrice
talk
not
to
me
dear
lady
of
a
husband
did
you
not
nurse
me
when
my
mother
died
did
you
not
shield
me
and
that
dearest
boy
and
had
we
any
other
friend
but
you
in
infancy
with
gentle
words
and
looks
to
win
our
father
not
to
murder
us
and
shall
i
now
desert
you
may
the
ghost
of
my
dead
mother
plead
against
my
soul
if
i
abandon
her
who
filled
the
place
she
left
with
more
even
than
a
mother
love
bernardo
and
i
am
of
my
sister
mind
indeed
i
would
not
leave
you
in
this
wretchedness
even

should
make
me
free
to
live
in
some
blithe
place
like
others
of

age

my
dear
dear
children
enter
cenci
suddenly
cenci
what
beatrice
here
come
hither
she
shrinks
back
and
covers
her
face
nay
hide
not
your
face
is
fair
look
up
why
yesternight
you
dared
to
look
with
disobedient
insolence
upon
me
bending
a
stern
and
an
inquiring
brow
on
what
i
meant
whilst
i
then
sought
to
hide
that
which
i
came
to
tell
you
but
in
vain
beatrice
wildly
staggering
towards
the
door
oh
that
the
earth
would
gape
hide
me
o
god
cenci
then
it
was
i
whose
inarticulate
words
fell
from
my
lips
and
who
with
tottering
steps
fled
from
your
presence
as
you
now
from
mine
stay
i
command
you
from
this
day
and
hour
never
again
i
think
with
fearless
eye
and
brow
superior
and
unaltered
cheek
and
that
lip
made
for
tenderness
or
scorn
shalt
thou
strike
dumb
the
meanest
of
mankind
me
least
of
all
now
get
thee
to
thy
chamber
thou
too
loathed
image
of
thy
cursed
mother
to
bernardo
thy
milky
meek
face
makes
me
sick
with
hate
exeunt
beatrice
and
bernardo
aside
so
much
has
passed
between
us
as
must
make
me
bold
her
is
an
awful
thing
to
touch
such
mischief
as
i
now
conceive
so
men
sit
shivering
on
the
dewy
bank
and
try
the
chill
stream
with
their
feet
once
in
how
the
delighted
spirit
pants
for
joy
lucretia
advancing
timidly
towards
him
o
husband
pray
forgive
poor
beatrice
she
meant
not
any
cenci
nor
you
perhaps
nor
that
young
imp
whom
you
have
taught
by
rote
parricide
with
his
alphabet
nor
giacomo
nor
those
two
most
unnatural
sons
who
stirred
enmity
up
against
me
with
the
pope
whom
in
one
night
merciful
god
cut
off
innocent
lambs
they
thought
not
any
you
were
not
here
conspiring
you
said
nothing
of
how
i
might
be
dungeoned
as
a
madman
or
be
condemned
to
death
for
some
offence
and
you
would
be
the
witnesses
this
failing
how
just
it
were
to
hire
assassins
or
put
sudden
poison
in
my
evening
drink
or
smother
me
when
overcome
by
wine
seeing
we
had
no
other
judge
but
god
and
he
had
sentenced
me
and
there
were
none
but
you
to
be
the
executioners
of
his
decree
enregistered
in
heaven
oh
no
you
said
not
this
lucretia
so
help
me
god
i
never
thought
the
things
you
charge
me
with
cenci
if
you
dare
to
speak
that
wicked
lie
again
i
kill
you
what
it
was
not
by
your
counsel
that
beatrice
disturbed
the
feast
last
night
you
did
not
hope
to
stir
some
enemies
against
me
and
escape
and
laugh
to
scorn
what
every
nerve
of
you
now
trembles
at
you
judged
that
men
were
bolder
than
they
are
few
dare
to
stand
between
their
grave
and
me
lucretia
look
not
so
dreadfully
by
my
salvation
i
knew
not
aught
that
beatrice
designed
nor
do
i
think
she
designed
any
thing
until
she
heard
you
talk
of
her
dead
brothers
cenci
blaspheming
liar
you
are
damned
for
this
but
i
will
take
you
where
you
may
persuade
the
stones
you
tread
on
to
deliver
you
for
men
shall
there
be
none
but
those
who
dare
all
things
not
question
that
which
i
command
on
wednesday
next
i
shall
set
out
you
know
that
savage
rock
the
castle
of
petrella
safely
walled
and
moated
round
about
its
dungeons
underground
and
its
thick
towers
never
told
tales
though
they
have
heard
and
seen
what
might
make
dumb
things
why
do
you
linger
make
speediest
preparation
for
the
journey
exit
lucretia
the
sun
yet
shines
i
hear
a
busy
stir
of
men
about
the
streets
i
see
the
bright
sky
through
the
window
panes
it
is
a
garish
broad
and
peering
day
loud
light
suspicious
full
of
eyes
and
ears
and
every
little
corner
nook
and
hole
is
penetrated
with
the
insolent
light
come
darkness
yet
what
is
the
day
to
me
and
wherefore
should
i
wish
for
night
who
do
a
deed
which
shall
confound
both
night
and
day
is
she
shall
grope
through
a
bewildering
mist
of
horror
if
there
be
a
sun
in
heaven
she
shall
not
dare
to
look
upon
its
beams
nor
feel
its
warmth
let
her
then
wish
for
night
the
act
i
think
shall
soon
extinguish
all
for
me
i
bear
a
darker
deadlier
gloom
than
the
earth
shade
or
interlunar
air
or
constellations
quenched
in
murkiest
cloud
in
which
i
walk
secure
and
unbeheld
towards
my
would
that
it
were
done
exit
scene
a
chamber
in
the
vatican
enter
camillo
and
giacomo
in
conversation
camillo
there
is
an
obsolete
and
doubtful
law
by
which
you
might
obtain
a
bare
provision
of
food
and
clothing
giacomo
nothing
more
alas
bare
must
be
the
provision
which
strict
law
awards
and
aged
sullen
avarice
pays
why
did
my
father
not
apprentice
me
to
some
mechanic
trade
i
should
have
then
been
trained
in
no
highborn
necessities
which
i
could
meet
not
by
my
daily
toil
the
eldest
son
of
a
rich
nobleman
is
heir
to
all
his
incapacities
he
has
wide
wants
and
narrow
powers
if
you
cardinal
camillo
were
reduced
at
once
from
beds
of
down
and
delicate
food
an
hundred
servants
and
six
palaces
to
that
which
nature
doth
indeed
require
camillo
nay
there
is
reason
in
your
plea
hard
giacomo
hard
for
a
firm
man
to
bear
but
i
have
a
dear
wife
a
lady
of
high
birth
whose
dowry
in
ill
hour
i
lent
my
father
without
a
bond
or
witness
to
the
deed
and
children
who
inherit
her
fine
senses
the
fairest
creatures
in
this
breathing
world
and
she
and
they
reproach
me
not
cardinal
do
you
not
think
the
pope
would
interpose
and
stretch
authority
beyond
the
law
camillo
though
your
peculiar
case
is
hard
i
know
the
pope
will
not
divert
the
course
of
law
after
that
impious
feast
the
other
night
i
spoke
with
him
and
urged
him
then
to
check
your
father
cruel
hand
he
frowned
and
said
are
disobedient
and
they
sting
their
fathers
hearts
to
madness
and
despair
requiting
years
of
care
with
contumely
i
pity
the
count
cenci
from
my
heart
his
outraged
love
perhaps
awakened
hate
and
thus
he
is
exasperated
to
ill
in
the
great
war
between
the
old
and
young
i
who
have
white
hairs
and
a
tottering
body
will
keep
at
least
blameless
neutrality
enter
orsino
you
my
good
lord
orsino
heard
those
words
orsino
what
words
giacomo
alas
repeat
them
not
again
there
then
is
no
redress
for
me
at
least
none
but
that
which
i
may
achieve
myself
since
i
am
driven
to
the
but
say
my
innocent
sister
and
my
only
brother
are
dying
underneath
my
father
eye
the
memorable
torturers
of
this
land
galeaz
visconti
borgia
ezzelin
never
inflicted
on
their
meanest
slave
what
these
endure
shall
they
have
no
protection
camillo
why
if
they
would
petition
to
the
pope
i
see
not
how
he
could
refuse
it
yet
he
holds
it
of
most
dangerous
example
in
aught
to
weaken
the
paternal
power
being
as
the
shadow
of
his
own
i
pray
you
now
excuse
me
i
have
business
that
will
not
bear
delay
exit
camillo
giacomo
but
you
orsino
have
the
petition
wherefore
not
present
it
orsino
i
have
presented
it
and
backed
it
with
my
earnest
prayers
and
urgent
interest
it
was
returned
unanswered
i
doubt
not
but
that
the
strange
and
execrable
deeds
alleged
in
it
in
truth
they
might
well
baffle
any
belief
have
turned
the
pope
displeasure
upon
the
accusers
from
the
criminal
so
i
should
guess
from
what
camillo
said
giacomo
my
friend
that
devil
gold
has
whispered
silence
to
his
holiness
and
we
are
left
as
scorpions
ringed
with
fire
what
should
we
do
but
strike
ourselves
to
death
for
he
who
is
our
murderous
persecutor
is
shielded
by
a
father
holy
name
or
i
would
stops
abruptly
orsino
what
fear
not
to
speak
your
thought
words
are
but
holy
as
the
deeds
they
cover
a
priest
who
has
forsworn
the
god
he
serves
a
judge
who
makes
truth
weep
at
his
decree
a
friend
who
should
weave
counsel
as
i
now
but
as
the
mantle
of
some
selfish
guile
a
father
who
is
all
a
tyrant
seems
were
the
profaner
for
his
sacred
name
note
makes
truth
edition
makes

giacomo
ask
me
not
what
i
think
the
unwilling
brain
feigns
often
what
it
would
not
and
we
trust
imagination
with
such
fantasies
as
the
tongue
dares
not
fashion
into
words
which
have
no
words
their
horror
makes
them
dim
to
the
mind
my
heart
denies
itself
to
think
what
you
demand
orsino
but
a
friend
bosom
is
as
the
inmost
cave
of
our
own
mind
where
we
sit
shut
from
the
wide
gaze
of
day
and
from
the
air
you
look
what
i
suspected
giacomo
spare
me
now
i
am
as
one
lost
in
a
midnight
wood
who
dares
not
ask
some
harmless
passenger
the
path
across
the
wilderness
lest
he
as
my
thoughts
are
should
be
a
murderer
i
know
you
are
my
friend
and
all
i
dare
speak
to
my
soul
that
will
i
trust
with
thee
but
now
my
heart
is
heavy
and
would
take
lone
counsel
from
a
night
of
sleepless
care
pardon
me
that
i
say
farewell
farewell
i
would
that
to
my
own
suspected
self
i
could
address
a
word
so
full
of
peace
orsino
farewell
be
your
thoughts
better
or
more
bold
exit
giacomo
i
had
disposed
the
cardinal
camillo
to
feed
his
hope
with
cold
encouragement
it
fortunately
serves
my
close
designs
that
is
a
trick
of
this
same
family
to
analyse
their
own
and
other
minds
such
shall
teach
the

dangerous
secrets
for
it
tempts
our
powers
knowing
what
must
be
thought
and
may
be
done
into
the
depth
of
darkest
purposes
so
cenci
fell
into
the
pit
even
i
since
beatrice
unveiled
me
to
myself
and
made
me
shrink
from
what
i
can
not
shun
show
a
poor
figure
to
my
own
esteem
to
which
i
grow
half
reconciled
i
do
as
little
mischief
as
i
can
that
thought
shall
fee
the
accuser
conscience
after
a
pause
now
what
harm
if
cenci
should
be
murdered
yet
if
murdered
wherefore
by
me
and
what
if
i
could
take
the
profit
yet
omit
the
sin
and
peril
in
such
an
action
of
all
earthly
things
i
fear
a
man
whose
blows
outspeed
his
words
and
such
is
cenci
and
while
cenci
lives
his
daughter
dowry
were
a
secret
grave
if
a
priest
wins
oh
fair
beatrice
would
that
i
loved
thee
not
or
loving
thee
could
but
despise
danger
and
gold
and
all
that
frowns
between
my
wish
and
its
effect
or
smiles
beyond
it
there
is
no
escape
her
bright
form
kneels
beside
me
at
the
altar
and
follows
me
to
the
resort
of
men
and
fills
my
slumber
with
tumultuous
dreams
so
when
i
wake
my
blood
seems
liquid
fire
and
if
i
strike
my
damp
and
dizzy
head
my
hot
palm
scorches
it
her
very
name
but
spoken
by
a
stranger
makes
my
heart
sicken
and
pant
and
thus
unprofitably
i
clasp
the
phantom
of
unfelt
delights
till
weak
imagination
half
possesses
the
shadow
yet
much
longer
will
i
not
nurse
this
life
of
feverous
hours
from
the
unravelled
hopes
of
giacomo
i
must
work
out
my
own

from
a

the
end
of
all
her
father
dead
her
brother

to
me

a
dark
secret
surer

scared

unexpostulating

dread

wish

faint

this

dare
should

my

should
be
oh
what
am
i
what
name
what
place
what
memory
shall
be
mine
what
retrospects
outliving
even
despair
lucretia
he
is
a
violent
tyrant
surely
child
we
know
that
death
alone
can
make
us
free
his
death
or
ours
but
what
can
he
have
done
of
deadlier
outrage
or
worse
injury
thou
art
unlike
thyself
thine
eyes
shoot
forth
a
wandering
and
strange
spirit
speak
to
me
unlock
those
pallid
hands
whose
fingers
twine
with
one
another
beatrice
the
restless
life
tortured
within
them
if
i
try
to
speak
i
shall
go
mad
ay
something
must
be
done
what
yet
i
know
not
something
which
shall
make
the
thing
that
i
have
suffered
but
a
shadow
in
the
dread
lightning
which
avenges
it
brief
rapid
irreversible
destroying
the
consequence
of
what
it
can
not
cure
some
such
thing
is
to
be
endured
or
done
when
i
know
what
i
shall
be
still
and
calm
and
never
anything
will
move
me
more
but
now
o
blood
which
art
my
father
blood
circling
through
these
contaminated
veins
if
thou
poured
forth
on
the
polluted
earth
could
wash
away
the
crime
and
punishment
by
which
i
suffer
no
that
can
not
be
many
might
doubt
there
were
a
god
above
who
sees
and
permits
evil
and
so
die
that
faith
no
agony
shall
obscure
in
me
lucretia
it
must
indeed
have
been
some
bitter
wrong
yet
what
i
dare
not
guess
oh
my
lost
child
hide
not
in
proud
impenetrable
grief
thy
sufferings
from
my
fear
beatrice
i
hide
them
not
what
are
the
words
which
yon
would
have
me
speak
i
who
can
feign
no
image
in
my
mind
of
that
which
has
transformed
me
i
whose
thought
is
like
a
ghost
shrouded
and
folded
up
in
its
own
formless
horror
of
all
words
that
minister
to
mortal
intercourse
which
wouldst
thou
hear
for
there
is
none
to
tell
my
misery
if
another
ever
knew
aught
like
to
it
she
died
as
i
will
die
and
left
it
as
i
must
without
a
name
death
death
our
law
and
our
religion
call
thee
a
punishment
and
a
reward
oh
which
have
i
deserved
lucretia
the
peace
of
innocence
till
in
your
season
you
be
called
to
heaven
you
may
have
suffered
you
have
done
no
evil
death
must
be
the
punishment
of
crime
or
the
reward
of
trampling
down
the
thorns
which
god
has
strewed
upon
the
path
which
leads
to
immortality
beatrice
ay
death
the
punishment
of
crime
i
pray
thee
god
let
me
not
be
bewildered
while
i
judge
if
i
must
live
day
after
day
and
keep
these
limbs
the
unworthy
temple
of
thy
spirit
as
a
foul
den
from
which
what
thou
abhorrest
may
mock
thee
unavenged
it
shall
not
be
no
that
might
be
no
escape
for
thy
decree
yawns
like
a
hell
between
our
will
and
it
o
in
this
mortal
world
there
is
no
vindication
and
no
law
which
can
adjudge
and
execute
the
doom
of
that
through
which
i
suffer
enter
orsino
she
approaches
him
solemnly
welcome
friend
i
have
to
tell
you
that
since
last
we
met
i
have
endured
a
wrong
so
great
and
strange
that
neither
life
nor
death
can
give
me
rest
ask
me
not
what
it
is
for
there
are
deeds
which
have
no
form
sufferings
which
have
no
tongue
note
nor
edition
or
editions
orsino
and
what
is
he
who
has
thus
injured
you
beatrice
the
man
they
call
my
father
a
dread
name
orsino
it
can
not
be
beatrice
what
it
can
be
or
not
forbear
to
think
it
is
and
it
has
been
advise
me
how
it
shall
not
be
again
i
thought
to
die
but
a
religious
awe
restrains
me
and
the
dread
lest
death
itself
might
be
no
refuge
from
the
consciousness
of
what
is
yet
unexpiated
oh
speak
orsino
accuse
him
of
the
deed
and
let
the
law
avenge
thee
beatrice
oh
counsellor
if
i
could
find
a
word
that
might
make
known
the
crime
of
my
destroyer
and
that
done
my
tongue
should
like
a
knife
tear
out
the
secret
which
cankers
my
heart
core
ay
lay
all
bare
so
that
my
unpolluted
fame
should
be
with
vilest
gossips
a
stale
mouthed
story
a
mock
a
byword
an
astonishment
if
this
were
done
which
never
shall
be
done
think
of
the
offender
gold
his
dreaded
hate
and
the
strange
horror
of
the
accuser
tale
baffling
belief
and
overpowering
speech
scarce
whispered
unimaginable
wrapped
in
hideous
hints
oh
most
assured
redress
orsino
you
will
endure
it
then
beatrice
endure
orsino
it
seems
your
counsel
is
small
profit
turns
from
him
and
speaks
half
to
herself
ay
all
must
be
suddenly
resolved
and
done
what
is
this
undistinguishable
mist
of
thoughts
which
rise
like
shadow
after
shadow
darkening
each
other
orsino
should
the
offender
live
triumph
in
his
misdeed
and
make
by
use
his
crime
it
is
dreadful
no
doubt
thine
element
until
thou
mayest
become
utterly
lost
subdued
even
to
the
hue
of
that
which
thou
permittest
beatrice
to
herself
mighty
death
thou
shadow
only
judge
rightfullest
arbiter
she
retires
absorbed
in
thought
lucretia
if
the
lightning
of
god
has
descended
to
avenge
orsino
blaspheme
not
his
high
providence
commits
its
glory
on
this
earth
and
their
own
wrongs
into
the
hands
of
men
if
they
neglect
to
punish
crime
lucretia
but
if
one
like
this
wretch
should
mock
with
gold
opinion
law
and
power
if
there
be
no
appeal
to
that
which
makes
the
guiltiest
tremble
if
because
our
wrongs
for
that
they
are
unnatural
strange
and
monstrous
exceed
all
measure
of
belief
o
god
if
for
the
very
reasons
which
should
make
redress
most
swift
and
sure
our
injurer
triumphs
and
we
the
victims
bear
worse
punishment
than
that
appointed
for
their
torturer
orsino
think
not
but
that
there
is
redress
where
there
is
wrong
so
we
be
bold
enough
to
seize
it
lucretia
how
if
there
were
any
way
to
make
all
sure
i
know
not
but
i
think
it
might
be
good
to
orsino
why
his
late
outrage
to
beatrice
for
it
is
such
as
i
but
faintly
guess
as
makes
remorse
dishonour
and
leaves
her
only
one
duty
how
she
may
avenge
you
but
one
refuge
from
ills
ill
endured
me
but
one
counsel
lucretia
for
we
can
not
hope
that
aid
or
retribution
or
resource
will
arise
thence
where
every
other
one
might
find
them
with
less
need
beatrice
advances
orsino
then
beatrice
peace
orsino
and
honoured
lady
while
i
speak
i
pray
that
you
put
off
as
garments
overworn
forbearance
and
respect
remorse
and
fear
and
all
the
fit
restraints
of
daily
life
which
have
been
borne
from
childhood
but
which
now
would
be
a
mockery
to
my
holier
plea
as
i
have
said
i
have
endured
a
wrong
which
though
it
be
expressionless
is
such
as
asks
atonement
both
for
what
is
past
and
lest
i
be
reserved
day
after
day
to
load
with
crimes
an
overburthened
soul
and
be
what
ye
can
dream
not
i
have
prayed
to
god
and
i
have
talked
with
my
own
heart
and
have
unravelled
my
entangled
will
and
have
at
length
determined
what
is
right
art
thou
my
friend
orsino
false
or
true
pledge
thy
salvation
ere
i
speak
orsino
i
swear
to
dedicate
my
cunning
and
my
strength
my
silence
and
whatever
else
is
mine
to
thy
commands
lucretia
you
think
we
should
devise
his
death
beatrice
and
execute
what
is
devised
and
suddenly
we
must
be
brief
and
bold
orsino
and
yet
most
cautious
lucretia
for
the
jealous
laws
would
punish
us
with
death
and
infamy
for
that
which
it
became
themselves
to
do
beatrice
be
cautious
as
ye
may
but
prompt
orsino
what
are
the
means
orsino
i
know
two
dull
fierce
outlaws
who
think
man
spirit
as
a
worm
and
they
would
trample
out
for
any
slight
caprice
the
meanest
or
the
noblest
life
this
mood
is
marketable
here
in
rome
they
sell
what
we
now
want
lucretia
before
dawn
cenci
will
take
us
to
that
lonely
rock
petrella
in
the
apulian
apennines
if
he
arrive
there
beatrice
he
must
not
arrive
orsino
will
it
be
dark
before
you
reach
the
tower
lucretia
the
sun
will
scarce
be
set
beatrice
but
i
remember
two
miles
on
this
side
of
the
fort
the
road
crosses
a
deep
ravine
is
rough
and
narrow
and
winds
with
short
turns
down
the
precipice
and
in
its
depth
there
is
a
mighty
rock
which
has
from
unimaginable
years
sustained
itself
with
terror
and
with
toil
over
a
gulf
and
with
the
agony
with
which
it
clings
seems
slowly
coming
down
even
as
a
wretched
soul
hour
after
hour
clings
to
the
mass
of
life
yet
clinging
leans
and
leaning
makes
more
dark
the
dread
abyss
in
which
it
fears
to
fall
beneath
this
crag
huge
as
despair
as
if
in
weariness
the
melancholy
mountain
yawns
below
you
hear
but
see
not
an
impetuous
torrent
raging
among
the
caverns
and
a
bridge
crosses
the
chasm
and
high
above
there
grow
with
intersecting
trunks
from
crag
to
crag
cedars
and
yews
and
pines
whose
tangled
hair
is
matted
in
one
solid
roof
of
shade
by
the
dark
ivy
twine
at
noonday
here
twilight
and
at
sunset
blackest
night
orsino
before
you
reach
that
bridge
make
some
excuse
for
spurring
on
your
mules
or
loitering
until
beatrice
what
sound
is
that
lucretia
hark
no
it
can
not
be
a
servant
step
it
must
be
cenci
unexpectedly
returned
make
some
excuse
for
being
here
beatrice
to
orsino
as
she
goes
out
that
step
we
hear
approach
must
never
pass
the
bridge
of
which
we
spoke
exeunt
lucretia
and
beatrice
orsino
what
shall
i
do
cenci
must
find
me
here
and
i
must
bear
the
imperious
inquisition
of
his
looks
as
to
what
brought
me
hither
let
me
mask
mine
own
in
some
inane
and
vacant
smile
enter
giacomo
in
a
hurried
manner
how
have
you
ventured
hither
know
you
then
that
cenci
is
from
home
note
hither
edition
thither
edition
giacomo
i
sought
him
here
and
now
must
wait
till
he
returns
orsino
great
god
weigh
you
the
danger
of
this
rashness
giacomo
ay
does
my
destroyer
know
his
danger
we
are
now
no
more
as
once
parent
and
child
but
man
to
man
the
oppressor
to
the
oppressed
the
slanderer
to
the
slandered
foe
to
foe
he
has
cast
nature
off
which
was
his
shield
and
nature
casts
him
off
who
is
her
shame
and
i
spurn
both
is
it
a
father
throat
which
i
will
shake
and
say
i
ask
not
gold
i
ask
not
happy
years
nor
memories
of
tranquil
childhood
nor
love
though
all
these
hast
thou
torn
from
me
and
more
but
only
my
fair
fame
only
one
hoard
of
peace
which
i
thought
hidden
from
thy
hate
under
the
penury
heaped
on
me
by
thee
or
i
will
god
can
understand
and
pardon
why
should
i
speak
with
man
orsino
be
calm
dear
friend
giacomo
well
i
will
calmly
tell
you
what
he
did
this
old
francesco
cenci
as
you
know
borrowed
the
dowry
of
my
wife
from
me
and
then
denied
the
loan
and
left
me
so
in
poverty
the
which
i
sought
to
mend
by
holding
a
poor
office
in
the
state
it
had
been
promised
to
me
and
already
i
bought
new
clothing
for
my
ragged
babes
and
my
wife
smiled
and
my
heart
knew
repose
when
cenci
intercession
as
i
found
conferred
this
office
on
a
wretch
whom
thus
he
paid
for
vilest
service
i
returned
with
this
ill
news
and
we
sate
sad
together
solacing
our
despondency
with
tears
of
such
affection
and
unbroken
faith
as
temper
life
worst
bitterness
when
he
as
he
is
wont
came
to
upbraid
and
curse
mocking
our
poverty
and
telling
us
such
was
god
scourge
for
disobedient
sons
and
then
that
i
might
strike
him
dumb
with
shame
i
spoke
of
my
wife
dowry
but
he
coined
a
brief
yet
specious
tale
how
i
had
wasted
the
sum
in
secret
riot
and
he
saw
my
wife
was
touched
and
he
went
smiling
forth
and
when
i
knew
the
impression
he
had
made
and
felt
my
wife
insult
with
silent
scorn
my
ardent
truth
and
look
averse
and
cold
i
went
forth
too
but
soon
returned
again
yet
not
so
soon
but
that
my
wife
had
taught
my
children
her
harsh
thoughts
and
they
all
cried
us
clothes
father
give
us
better
food
what
you
in
one
night
squander
were
enough
for
months
i
looked
and
saw
that
home
was
hell
and
to
that
hell
will
i
return
no
more
until
mine
enemy
has
rendered
up
atonement
or
as
he
gave
life
to
me
i
will
reversing
nature
law
orsino
trust
me
the
compensation
which
thou
seekest
here
will
be
denied
giacomo
then
are
you
not
my
friend
did
you
not
hint
at
the
alternative
upon
the
brink
of
which
you
see
i
stand
the
other
day
when
we
conversed
together
my
wrongs
were
then
less
that
word
parricide
although
i
am
resolved
haunts
me
like
fear
orsino
it
must
be
fear
itself
for
the
bare
word
is
hollow
mockery
mark
how
wisest
god
draws
to
one
point
the
threads
of
a
just
doom
so
sanctifying
it
what
you
devise
is
as
it
were
accomplished
giacomo
is
he
dead
orsino
his
grave
is
ready
know
that
since
we
met
cenci
has
done
an
outrage
to
his
daughter
giacomo
what
outrage
orsino
that
she
speaks
not
but
you
may
conceive
such
half
conjectures
as
i
do
from
her
fixed
paleness
and
the
lofty
grief
of
her
stern
brow
bent
on
the
idle
air
and
her
severe
unmodulated
voice
drowning
both
tenderness
and
dread
and
last
from
this
that
whilst
her
and
i
bewildered
in
our
horror
talked
together
with
obscure
hints
both
and
darkly
guessing
stumbling
in
our
talk
over
the
truth
and
yet
to
its
revenge
she
interrupted
us
and
with
a
look
which
told
before
she
spoke
it
he
must
die
giacomo
it
is
enough
my
doubts
are
well
appeased
there
is
a
higher
reason
for
the
act
than
mine
there
is
a
holier
judge
than
me
a
more
unblamed
avenger
beatrice
who
in
the
gentleness
of
thy
sweet
youth
hast
never
trodden
on
a
worm
or
bruised
a
living
flower
but
thou
hast
pitied
it
with
needless
tears
fair
sister
thou
in
whom
men
wondered
how
such
loveliness
and
wisdom
did
not
destroy
each
other
is
there
made
ravage
of
thee
o
heart
i
ask
no
more
justification
shall
i
wait
orsino
till
he
return
and
stab
him
at
the
door
orsino
not
so
some
accident
might
interpose
to
rescue
him
from
what
is
now
most
sure
and
you
are
unprovided
where
to
fly
how
to
excuse
or
to
conceal
nay
listen
all
is
contrived
success
is
so
assured
that
enter

beatrice
my
brother
voice
you
know
me
not
giacomo
my
sister
my
lost
sister
beatrice
lost
indeed
i
see
orsino
has
talked
with
you
and
that
you
conjecture
things
too
horrible
to
speak
yet
far
less
than
the
truth
now
stay
not
he
might
return
yet
kiss
me
i
shall
know
that
then
thou
hast
consented
to
his
death
farewell
farewell
let
piety
to
god
brotherly
love
justice
and
clemency
and
all
things
that
make
tender
hardest
hearts
make
thine
hard
brother
answer
not
farewell
exeunt

a

in

house
giacomo
alone
giacomo
midnight
and
orsino
comes
not

thunder
and
the
sound
of
a
storm
what
can
the
everlasting
elements
feel
with
a
worm
like

the

would

my

they
are
now
living

i
must
wake
still
doubting
if
that
deed
be

necessary
o
thou
unreplenished
lamp
whose
narrow
fire
is
shaken
by
the
wind
and
on
whose
edge
devouring
darkness
hovers
thou
small
flame
which
as
a
dying
pulse
rises
and
falls
still
flickerest
up
and
down
how
very
soon
did
i
not
feed
thee
wouldst
thou
fail
and
be
as
thou
hadst
never
been
so
wastes
and
sinks
even
now
perhaps
the
life
that
kindled
mine
but
that
no
power
can
fill
with
vital
oil
that
broken
lamp
of
flesh
ha
is
the
blood
which
fed
these
veins
that
ebbs
till
all
is
cold
it
is
the
form
that
moulded
mine
that
sinks
into
the
white
and
yellow
spasms
of
death
it
is
the
soul
by
which
mine
was
arrayed
in
god
immortal
likeness
which
now
stands
naked
before
heaven
judgement
seat
a
bell
strikes
one
two
the
hours
crawl
on
and
when
my
hairs
are
white
my
son
will
then
perhaps
be
waiting
thus
tortured
between
just
hate
and
vain
remorse
chiding
the
tardy
messenger
of
news
like
those
which
i
expect
i
almost
wish
he
be
not
dead
although
my
wrongs
are
great
yet
is
orsino
step
enter
orsino
speak
orsino
i
am
come
to
say
he
has
escaped
giacomo
escaped
orsino
and
safe
within
petrella
he
passed
by
the
spot
appointed
for
the
deed
an
hour
too
soon
giacomo
are
we
the
fools
of
such
contingencies
and
do
we
waste
in
blind
misgivings
thus
the
hours
when
we
should
act
then
wind
and
thunder
which
seemed
to
howl
his
knell
is
the
loud
laughter
with
which
heaven
mocks
our
weakness
i
henceforth
will
repent
of
aught
designed
or
done
but
my
repentance
orsino
see
the
lamp
is
out
giacomo
if
no
remorse
is
ours
when
the
dim
air
has
drank
this
innocent
flame
why
should
we
quail
when
cenci
life
that
light
by
which
ill
spirits
see
the
worst
deeds
they
prompt
shall
sink
for
ever
no
i
am
hardened
orsino
why
what
need
of
this
who
feared
the
pale
intrusion
of
remorse
in
a
just
deed
although
our
first
plan
failed
doubt
not
but
he
will
soon
be
laid
to
rest
but
light
the
lamp
let
us
not
talk
i
the
dark
giacomo
lighting
the
lamp
and
yet
once
quenched
i
can
not
thus
relume
my
father
life
do
you
not
think
his
ghost
might
plead
that
argument
with
god
orsino
once
gone
you
can
not
now
recall
your
sister
peace
your
own
extinguished
years
of
youth
and
hope
nor
your
wife
bitter
words
nor
all
the
taunts
which
from
the
prosperous
weak
misfortune
takes
nor
your
dead
mother
nor
giacomo
o
speak
no
more
i
am
resolved
although
this
very
hand
must
quench
the
life
that
animated
it
orsino
there
is
no
need
of
that
listen
you
know
olimpio
the
castellan
of
petrella
in
old
colonna
time
him
whom
your
father
degraded
from
his
post
and
marzio
that
desperate
wretch
whom
he
deprived
last
year
of
a
reward
of
blood
well
earned
and
due
giacomo
i
knew
olimpio
and
they
say
he
hated
old
cenci
so
that
in
his
silent
rage
his
lips
grew
white
only
to
see
him
pass
of
marzio
i
know
nothing

have
sent

in

and
as
at
your
request
to
talk
with
beatrice

lucretia
giacomo
only
to
talk
orsino
the
moments
which
even
now
pass
onward
to
midnight
hour
may
memorize
their
flight
with
death
ere
then
they
must
have
talked
and
may
perhaps
have
done

made
an
end
giacomo
listen
what
sound
is
that
orsino
the
moans
and
the
beams
crack
nought

giacomo
it
is
my

complaining
in

sleep
i

not
she
is
saying
bitter
things
of
me
and
all
my
children
round
her
dreaming
that
i
deny
them
sustenance
orsino
whilst
he
who
truly
took
it
from
them
and
who
fills
their
hungry
rest
with
bitterness
now
sleeps
lapped
in
bad
pleasures
and
triumphantly
mocks
thee
in
visions
of
successful
hate
too
like
the
truth
of
day
giacomo
if
he
wakes
again
i
will
not
trust

it
is
the
iron

which
ye

swinging
to
the
wind
that
enters
whistling
as
in
scorn
come
follow
and
be
your

they
are
about
it
now
beatrice
nay
it
is
done
lucretia
i
have
not
heard
him
groan
beatrice
he
will
not

lucretia
what
sound
is
that
beatrice
list
is
the
tread
of
feet
about
his

lucretia
my
god
if
he
be
now
a
cold
stiff
corpse
beatrice
o
fear

the

and
marzio
is
it
accomplished
marzio
what
olimpio
did
you
not
call
beatrice
when
olimpio
now
beatrice
i
ask
if
all
is
over
olimpio
we
dare
not
kill
an
old
and
sleeping
man
his
thin
gray
hair
his
stern
and
reverend
brow
his
veined
hands
crossed
on
his
heaving
breast
and
the
calm
innocent
sleep
in
which
he
lay
quelled
me
indeed
indeed
i
can
not
do
it
note
reverend
reverent
all
editions
marzio
but
i
was
bolder
for
i
chid
olimpio
and
bade
him
bear
his
wrongs
to
his
own
grave
and
leave
me
the
reward
and
now
my
knife
touched
the
loose
wrinkled
throat
when
the
old
man
stirred
in
his
sleep
and
said
hear
o
hear
a
father
curse
what
art
thou
not
our
father
and
then
he
laughed
i
knew
it
was
the
ghost
of
my
dead
father
speaking
through
his
lips
and
could
not
kill
him
beatrice
miserable
slaves
where
if
ye
dare
not
kill
a
sleeping
man
found
ye
the
boldness
to
return
to
me
with
such
a
deed
undone
base
palterers
cowards
and
traitors
why
the
very
conscience
which
ye
would
sell
for
gold
and
for
revenge
is
an
equivocation
it
sleeps
over
a
thousand
daily
acts
disgracing
men
and
when
a
deed
where
mercy
insults
heaven
why
do
i
talk
snatching
a
dagger
from
one
of
them
and
raising
it
hadst
thou
a
tongue
to
say
murdered
her
own
father
i
must
do
it
but
never
dream
ye
shall
outlive
him
long
olimpio
stop
for
god
sake
marzio
i
will
go
back
and
kill

that
which
a
deadly
crime
to
leave

lucretia
would
it
were
done
beatrice
even
whilst
that
doubt
is
passing
through
your
mind
the
world
is
conscious
of
a
change
darkness
and
hell
have
swallowed
up
the
vapour
they
sent
forth
to
blacken
the
sweet
light
of
life
my
breath
comes
methinks
lighter
and
the
jellied
blood
runs
freely
through
my
veins
hark
enter
olimpio
and
marzio
he
is
olimpio
dead
marzio
we
strangled
him
that
there
might
be

we
threw
his
heavy
corpse
i
the
garden
under
the
balcony
seem

fell

giving
them
a
bag
of
coin
here
take

because
thou
wast
only
awed
by
that
which
made
me
tremble
wear
thou
this
clothes
him
in
a
rich
mantle
it
was
the
mantle
which
my
grandfather
wore
in
his
high
prosperity
and
men
envied
his
state
so
may
they
envy
thine
thou
wert
a

to
a
just

beatrice
some
tedious

there
is
a
tramp

beatrice
let
us
retire
to
counterfeit
deep
rest
i
scarcely

to
counterfeit
it
now
the
spirit
which
doth
reign
within
these
limbs
seems
strangely
undisturbed
i
could
even
sleep
fearless
and
calm
all
ill
is
surely
past
exeunt

unseasonably
i
break
upon

must
speak
with
count
cenci
doth
he
sleep
lucretia
in
a
hurried
and
confused
manner
i
think
he
sleeps
yet
wake
him
not
i
pray
spare
me
awhile
he
is
a
wicked
and
a
wrathful
man
should
he
be
roused
out
of
his
sleep
which
is
i
know
a
hell
of
angry
dreams
it
were
not
well
indeed
it
were
not
well
wait
till
day
break
aside
oh
i
am
deadly
sick
note
a
wrathful
edition
wrathful
editions
savella
i
grieve
thus
to
distress
you
but
the
count
must
answer
charges
of
the
gravest
import
and
suddenly
such
my
commission
is
lucretia
with
increased
agitation
i
dare
not
rouse
him
i
know
none
who
dare
perilous
you
might
as
safely
waken
a
serpent
or
a
corpse
in
which
some
fiend
were
laid
to
sleep
savella
lady
my
moments
here
are
counted
i
must
rouse
him
from
his
sleep
since
none
else
dare
lucretia
aside
o
terror
o
despair
to
bernardo

conduct
you

to
your

come
to
arrest
the
culprit
who
now
stands
before
the
throne
of
unappealable
god
both
earth
and
heaven
consenting
arbiters
acquit
our
deed
lucretia
oh
agony
of
fear
would
that
he
yet
might
live
even
now
i
heard
the
legate
followers
whisper
as
they
passed
they
had
a
warrant
for
his
instant
death
all
was
prepared
by
unforbidden
means
which
we
must
pay
so
dearly
having
done
even
now
they
search
the
tower
and
find
the
body
now
they
suspect
the
truth
now
they
consult
before
they
come
to
tax
us
with
the
fact
o
horrible
is
all
discovered
beatrice
mother
what
is
done
wisely
is
done
well
be
bold
as
thou
art
just
is
like
a
truant
child
to
fear
that
others
know
what
thou
hast
done
even
from
thine
own
strong
consciousness
and
thus
write
on
unsteady
eyes
and
altered
cheeks
all
thou
wouldst
hide
be
faithful
to
thyself
and
fear
no
other
witness
but
thy
fear
for
if
as
can
not
be
some
circumstance
should
rise
in
accusation
we
can
blind
suspicion
with
such
cheap
astonishment
or
overbear
it
with
such
guiltless
pride
as
murderers
can
not
feign
the
deed
is
done
and
what
may
follow
now
regards
not
me
i
am
as
universal
as
the
light
free
as
the
air
as
firm
as
the
world
centre
consequence
to
me
is
as
the
wind
which
strikes
the
solid
rock
but
shakes
it
not
a
cry
within
and
tumult
voices
murder
murder
murder
enter
bernardo
and
savella
savella
to
his
followers
go
search
the
castle
round
sound
the
alarm
look
to
the
gates
that
none
escape
beatrice
what
now
bernardo
i
know
not
what
to
say
my
father
dead
beatrice
how
dead
he
only
sleeps
you
mistake
brother
his
sleep
is
very
calm
very
like
death
wonderful
how
well
a
tyrant
sleeps
he
is
not
dead
bernardo
dead
murdered
lucretia
with
extreme
agitation
oh
no
no
he
is
not
murdered
though
he
may
be
dead
i
have
alone
the
keys
of
those
apartments
savella
ha
is
it
so
beatrice
my
lord
i
pray
excuse
us
we
will
retire
my
mother
is
not
well
she
seems
quite
overcome
with
this
strange
horror
exeunt
lucretia
and
beatrice
savella
can
you
suspect
who
may
have
murdered
him
bernardo
i
know
not
what
to
think
savella
can
you
name
any
who
had
an
interest
in
his
death
bernardo
alas
i
can
name
none
who
had
not
and
those
most
who
most
lament
that
such
a
deed
is
done
my
mother
and
my
sister
and
myself
savella
strange
there
were
clear
marks
of
violence
i
found
the
old
man
body
in
the
moonlight
hanging
beneath
the
window
of
his
chamber
among
the
branches
of
a
pine
he
could
not
have
fallen
there
for
all
his
limbs
lay
heaped
and
effortless
is
true
there
was
no
blood
favour
me
sir
it
much
imports
your
house
that
all
should
be
made
clear
to
tell
the
ladies
that
i
request
their
presence
exit
bernardo
enter
guards
bringing
in
marzio
guard
we
have
one
officer
my
lord
we
found
this
ruffian
and
another
lurking
among
the
rocks
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
they
are
the
murderers
of
count
cenci
each
had
a
bag
of
coin
this
fellow
wore
a
robe
which
shining
bright
under
the
dark
rocks
to
the
glimmering
moon
betrayed
them
to
our
notice
the
other
fell
desperately
fighting
savella
what
does
he
confess
officer
he
keeps
firm
silence
but
these
lines
found
on
him
may
speak
savella
their
language
is
at
least
sincere
reads
the
lady
beatrice
that
the
atonement
of
what
my
nature
sickens
to
conjecture
may
soon
arrive
i
send
thee
at
thy
brother
desire
those
who
will
speak
and
do
more
than
i
dare
write
devoted
servant
orsino
enter
lucretia
beatrice
and
bernardo
knowest
thou
this
writing
lady
beatrice
no
savella
nor
thou
lucretia
her
conduct
throughout
the
scene
is
marked
by
extreme
agitation
where
was
it
found
what
is
it
it
should
be
orsino
hand
it
speaks
of
that
strange
horror
which
never
yet
found
utterance
but
which
made
between
that
hapless
child
and
her
dead
father
a
gulf
of
obscure
hatred
savella
is
it
so
is
it
true
lady
that
thy
father
did
such
outrages
as
to
awaken
in
thee
unfilial
hate
beatrice
not
hate
was
more
than
hate
this
is
most
true
yet
wherefore
question
me
savella
there
is
a
deed
demanding
question
done
thou
hast
a
secret
which
will
answer
not
beatrice
what
sayest
my
lord
your
words
are
bold
and
rash
savella
i
do
arrest
all
present
in
the
name
of
the
pope
holiness
you
must
to
rome
lucretia
o
not
to
rome
indeed
we
are
not
guilty
beatrice
guilty
who
dares
talk
of
guilt
my
lord
i
am
more
innocent
of
parricide
than
is
a
child
born
fatherless
dear
mother
your
gentleness
and
patience
are
no
shield
for
this
world
this
lie
which
seems
but
is
not
what
will
human
laws
rather
will
ye
who
are
their
ministers
bar
all
access
to
retribution
first
and
then
when
heaven
doth
interpose
to
do
what
ye
neglect
arming
familiar
things
to
the
redress
of
an
unwonted
crime
make
ye
the
victims
who
demanded
it
culprits
is
ye
are
culprits
that
poor
wretch
who
stands
so
pale
and
trembling
and
amazed
if
it
be
true
he
murdered
cenci
was
a
sword
in
the
right
hand
of
justest
god
wherefore
should
i
have
wielded
it
unless
the
crimes
which
mortal
tongue
dare
never
name
god
therefore
scruples
to
avenge
savella
you
own
that
you
desired
his
death
beatrice
it
would
have
been
a
crime
no
less
than
his
if
for
one
moment
that
fierce
desire
had
faded
in
my
heart
is
true
i
did
believe
and
hope
and
pray
ay
i
even
knew
for
god
is
wise
and
just
that
some
strange
sudden
death
hung
over
him
true
that
this
did
happen
and
most
true
there
was
no
other
rest
for
me
on
earth
no
other
hope
in
heaven
now
what
of
this
savella
strange
thoughts
beget
strange
deeds
and
here
are
both
i
judge
thee
not
beatrice
and
yet
if
you
arrest
me
you
are
the
judge
and
executioner
of
that
which
is
the
life
of
life
the
breath
of
accusation
kills
an
innocent
name
and
leaves
for
lame
acquittal
the
poor
life
which
is
a
mask
without
it
is
most
false
that
i
am
guilty
of
foul
parricide
although
i
must
rejoice
for
justest
cause
that
other
hands
have
sent
my
father
soul
to
ask
the
mercy
he
denied
to
me
now
leave
us
free
stain
not
a
noble
house
with
vague
surmises
of
rejected
crime
add
to
our
sufferings
and
your
own
neglect
no
heavier
sum
let
them
have
been
enough
leave
us
the
wreck
we
have
savella
i
dare
not
lady
i
pray
that
you
prepare
yourselves
for
rome
there
the
pope
further
pleasure
will
be
known
lucretia
o
not
to
rome
o
take
us
not
to
rome
beatrice
why
not
to
rome
dear
mother
there
as
here
our
innocence
is
as
an
armed
heel
to
trample
accusation
god
is
there
as
here
and
with
his
shadow
ever
clothes
the
innocent
the
injured
and
the
weak
and
such
are
we
cheer
up
dear
lady
lean
on
me
collect
your
wandering
thoughts
my
lord
as
soon
as
you
have
taken
some
refreshment
and
had
all
such
examinations
made
upon
the
spot
as
may
be
necessary
to
the
full
understanding
of
this
matter
we
shall
be
ready
mother

they
will
bind
us
to
the
rack
and
wrest
from
our
agony

confronted
all
demanding
each
from
the
other
countenance
the
thing
which
is
in
every
heart
o
misery
she
faints
and
is
borne
out
savella
she
faints
an
ill
appearance
this
beatrice
my
lord
she
knows
not
yet
the
uses
of
the
world
she
fears
that
power
is
as
a
beast
which
grasps
and
loosens
not
a
snake
whose
look
transmutes
all
things
to
guilt
which
is
its
nutriment
she
can
not
know
how
well
the
supine
slaves
of
blind
authority
read
the
truth
of
things
when
written
on
a
brow
of
guilelessness
she
sees
not
yet
triumphant
innocence
stand
at
the
of
mortal
man
a
judge
and
an
accuser
of
the
wrong
which
drags
it
there
prepare
yourself
my

palace
enter
orsino
and
giacomo
giacomo
do
evil
deeds
thus
quickly
come
to
end
o
that
the
vain
remorse
which
must
chastise
crimes
done
had
but
as
loud
a
voice
to
warn
as
its
keen
sting
is
mortal
to
avenge
o
that
the
hour
when
present
had
cast
off
the
mantle
of
its
mystery
and
shown
the
ghastly
form
with
which
it
now
returns
when
its
scared
game
is
roused
cheering
the
hounds
of
conscience
to
their
prey
alas
alas
it
was
a
wicked
thought
a
piteous
deed
to
kill
an
old
and
father
orsino
it
has
turned
out
unluckily
in
truth
giacomo
to
violate
the
sacred
doors
of
sleep
to
cheat
kind
nature
of
the
placid
death
which
she
prepares
for
overwearied
age
to
drag
from
heaven
an
unrepentant
soul
which
might
have
quenched
in
reconciling
prayers
a
life
of
burning
crimes
orsino
you
can
not
say
i
urged
you
to
the
deed
giacomo
o
had
i
never
found
in
thy
smooth
and
ready
countenance
the
mirror
of
my
darkest
thoughts
hadst
thou
never
with
hints
and
questions
made
me
look
upon
the
monster
of
my
thought
until
it
grew
familiar
to
desire
orsino
thus
men
cast
the
blame
of
their
unprosperous
acts
upon
the
abettors
of
their
own
resolve
or
anything
but
their
weak
guilty
selves
and
yet
confess
the
truth
it
is
the
peril
in
which
you
stand
that
gives
you
this
pale
sickness
of
penitence
confess
is
fear
disguised
from
its
own
shame
that
takes
the
mantle
now
of
thin
remorse
what
if
we
yet
were
safe
giacomo
how
can
that
be
already
beatrice
lucretia
and
the
murderer
are
in

o

how
canst
thou

along

giacomo
i
sorry
for
it

the

are
waiting
at
his
own

and
such
was
my
contrivance
that
i
might
rid
me
both
of
him
and
them
i
thought
to
act
a
solemn
comedy
upon
the
painted
scene
of
this
new
world
and
to
attain
my
own
peculiar
ends
by
some
such
plot
of
mingled
good
and
ill
as
others
weave
but
there
arose
a
power
which
grasped
and
snapped
the
threads
of
my
device
and
turned
it
to
a
net
of
ruin
ha
a
shout
is
heard
is
that
my
name
i
hear
proclaimed
abroad
but
i
will
pass
wrapped
in
a
vile
disguise
rags
on
my
back
and
a
false
innocence
upon
my
face
through
the
misdeeming
crowd
which
judges
by
what
seems
is
easy
then
for
a
new
name
and
for
a
country
new
and
a
new
life
fashioned
on
old
desires
to
change
the
honours
of
abandoned
rome
and
these
must
be
the
masks
of
that
within
which
must
remain
unaltered
oh
i
fear
that
what
is
past
will
never
let
me
rest
why
when
none
else
is
conscious
but
myself
of
my
misdeeds
should
my
own
heart
contempt
trouble
me
have
i
not
the
power
to
fly
my
own
reproaches
shall
i
be
the

what
a
word
which
those
of
this
false
world
employ
against
each
other
not
themselves
as
men
wear
daggers
not
for
but
if
i
am
mistaken
where
shall
i
find
the

poison
your

mayst
thou
answer

what
evil
have
we
done
thee
i
alas
have
lived
but
on
this
earth
a
few
sad
years
and
so
my
lot
was
ordered
that
a
father
first
turned
the
moments
of
awakening
life
to
drops
each
poisoning

sweet
hope

then
stabbed
with

my

that
peace
which
sleeps
within
the
core

the

was

lift

in
pity
and
love
armed
thee
as
thou
dost
say

cut
him
off

his

becomes
my
accusation

art
thou

worse

have
done
this

more
for
there
was
one
who
was
most
pure
and
innocent
on

because
she
endured
what
never
any
guilty

innocent
endured
before
because
her
wrongs
could

soon
will
be
as
soft
as
any
grave
but
the
falsehood
it
can
wring
from
fear
makes
the
rack
cruel
giacomo
they
will
tear
the
truth
even
from
thee
at
last
those
cruel
pains
for
pity
sake
say
thou
art
guilty
now
lucretia
oh
speak
the
truth
let
us
all
quickly
die
and
after
death
god
is
our
judge
not
they
he
will
have
mercy
on
us
bernardo
if
indeed
it
can
be
true
say
so
dear
sister
mine
and
then
the
pope
will
surely
pardon
you
and
all
be
well
judge
confess
or
i
will
warp
your
limbs
with
such
keen
tortures
beatrice
tortures
turn
the
rack
henceforth
into
a
torture
your
dog
that
he
may
tell
when
last
he
lapped
the
blood
his
master
shed
not
me
my
pangs
are
of
the
mind
and
of
the
heart
and
of
the
soul
ay
of
the
inmost
soul
which
weeps
within
tears
as
of
burning
gall
to
see
in
this
ill
world
where
none
are
true
my
kindred
false
to
their
deserted
selves
and
with
considering
all
the
wretched
life
which
i
have
lived
and
its
now
wretched
end
and
the
small
justice
shown
by
heaven
and
earth
to
me
or
mine
and
what
a
tyrant
thou
art
and
what
slaves
these
and
what
a
world
we
make
the
oppressor
and
the
oppressed
such
pangs
compel
my
answer
what
is
it
thou
wouldst
with
me
judge
art
thou
not
guilty
of
thy
father
death
beatrice
or
wilt
thou
rather
tax
god
that
he
permitted
such
an
act
as
that
which
i
have
suffered
and
which
he
beheld
made
it
unutterable
and
took
from
it
all
refuge
all
revenge
all
consequence
but
that
which
thou
hast
called
my
father
death
which
is
or
is
not
what
men
call
a
crime
which
either
i
have
done
or
have
not
done
say
what
ye
will
i
shall
deny
no
more
if
ye
desire
it
thus
thus
let
it
be
and
so
an
end
of
all
now
do
your
will
no
other
pains
shall
force
another
word
judge
she
is
convicted
but
has
not
confessed
be
it
enough
until
their
final
sentence
let
none
have
converse
with
them
you
young
lord
linger
not
here
beatrice
oh
tear
him
not
away
judge
guards
do
your
duty
bernardo
embracing
beatrice
oh
would
ye
divide
body
from
soul
officer
that
is
the
headsman
business
exeunt
all
but
lucretia
beatrice
and
giacomo
giacomo
have
i
confessed
is
it
all
over
now
no
hope
no
refuge
o
weak
wicked
tongue
which
hast
destroyed
me
would
that
thou
hadst
been
cut
out
and
thrown
to
dogs
first
to
have
killed
my
father
first
and
then
betrayed
my
sister
ay
thee
the
one
thing
innocent
and
pure
in
this
black
guilty
world
to
that
which
i
so
well
deserve
my
wife
my
little
ones
destitute
helpless
and
i
father
god
canst
thou
forgive
even
the
unforgiving
when
their
full
hearts
break
thus
thus
covers
his
face
and
weeps
lucretia
o
my
child
to
what
a
dreadful
end
are
we
all
come
why
did
i
yield
why
did
i
not
sustain
those
torments
oh
that
i
were
all
dissolved
into
these
fast
and
unavailing
tears
which
flow
and
feel
not
beatrice
what
was
weak
to
do
weaker
to
lament
once
being
done
take
cheer
the
god
who
knew
my
wrong
and
made
our
speedy
act
the
angel
of
his
wrath
seems
and
but
seems
to
have
abandoned
us
let
us
not
think
that
we
shall
die
for
this
brother
sit
near
me
give
me
your
firm
hand
you
had
a
manly
heart
bear
up
bear
up
o
dearest
lady
put
your
gentle
head
upon
my
lap
and
try
to
sleep
awhile
your
eyes
look
pale
hollow
and
overworn
with
heaviness
of
watching
and
slow
grief
come
i
will
sing
you
some
low
sleepy
tune
not
cheerful
nor
yet
sad
some
dull
old
thing
some
outworn
and
unused
monotony
such
as
our
country
gossips
sing
and
spin
till
they
almost
forget
they
live
lie
down
so
that
will
do
have
i
forgot
the
words
faith
they
are
sadder
than
i
thought
they
were
song
false
friend
wilt
thou
smile
or
weep
when
my
life
is
laid
asleep
little
cares
for
a
smile
or
a
tear
the
corpse
upon
the
bier
farewell
heighho
what
is
this
whispers
low
there
is
a
snake
in
thy
smile
my
dear
and
bitter
poison
within
thy
tear
sweet
sleep
were
death
like
to
thee
or
if
thou
couldst
mortal
be
i
would
close
these
eyes
of
pain
when
to
wake
never
again
o
world
farewell
listen
to
the
passing
bell
it
says
thou
and
i
must
part
with
a
light
and
a
heavy
heart
the
scene
closes
scene
a
hall
of
the
prison
enter
camillo
and
bernardo
camillo
the
pope
is
stern
not
to
be
moved
or
bent
he
looked
as
calm
and
keen
as
is
the
engine
which
tortures
and
which
kills
exempt
itself
from
aught
that
it
inflicts
a
marble
form
a
rite
a
law
a
custom
not
a
man
he
frowned
as
if
to
frown
had
been
the
trick
of
his
machinery
on
the
advocates
presenting
the
defences
which
he
tore
and
threw
behind
muttering
with
hoarse
harsh
voice
among
ye
defended
their
old
father
killed
in
his
sleep
then
to
another
dost
this
in
virtue
of
thy
place
is
well
he
turned
to
me
then
looking
deprecation
and
said
these
three
words
coldly
must
die
bernardo
and
yet
you
left
him
not
camillo
i
urged
him
still
pleading
as
i
could
guess
the
devilish
wrong
which
prompted
your
unnatural
parent
death
and
he
replied
santa
croce
murdered
his
mother
yester
evening
and
he
is
fled
parricide
grows
so
rife
that
soon
for
some
just
cause
no
doubt
the
young
will
strangle
us
all
dozing
in
our
chairs
authority
and
power
and
hoary
hair
are
grown
crimes
capital
you
are
my
nephew
you
come
to
ask
their
pardon
stay
a
moment
here
is
their
sentence
never
see
me
more
till
to
the
letter
it
be
all
fulfilled
bernardo
o
god
not
so
i
did
believe
indeed
that
all
you
said
was
but
sad
preparation
for
happy
news
oh
there
are
words
and
looks
to
bend
the
sternest
purpose
once
i
knew
them
now
i
forget
them
at
my
dearest
need
what
think
you
if
i
seek
him
out
and
bathe
his
feet
and
robe
with
hot
and
bitter
tears
importune
him
with
prayers
vexing
his
brain
with
my
perpetual
cries
until
in
rage
he
strike
me
with
his
pastoral
cross
and
trample
upon
my
prostrate
head
so
that
my
blood
may
stain
the
senseless
dust
on
which
he
treads
and
remorse
waken
mercy
i
will
do
it
oh
wait
till
i
return
rushes
out
camillo
alas
poor
boy
a
seaman
thus
might
pray
to
the
deaf
sea
enter
lucretia
beatrice
and
giacomo
guarded
beatrice
i
hardly
dare
to
fear
that
thou
other
news
than
a
just
pardon
camillo
may
god
in
heaven
be
less
inexorable
to
the
pope
prayers
than
he
has
been
to
mine
here
is
the
sentence
and
the
warrant
beatrice
wildly
o
my
god
can
it
be
possible
i
have
to
die
so
suddenly
so
young
to
go
under
the
obscure
cold
rotting
wormy
ground
to
be
nailed
down
into
a
narrow
place
to
see
no
more
sweet
sunshine
hear
no
more
blithe
voice
of
living
thing
muse
not
again
upon
familiar
thoughts
sad
yet
thus
lost
how
fearful
to
be
nothing
or
to
be
what
oh
where
am
i
let
me
not
go
mad
sweet
heaven
forgive
weak
thoughts
if
there
should
be
no
god
no
heaven
no
earth
in
the
void
world
the
wide
gray
lampless
deep
unpeopled
world
if
all
things
then
should
be
my
father
spirit
his
eye
his
voice
his
touch
surrounding
me
the
atmosphere
and
breath
of
my
dead
life
if
sometimes
as
a
shape
more
like
himself
even
the
form
which
tortured
me
on
earth
masked
in
gray
hairs
and
wrinkles
he
should
come
and
wind
me
in
his
hellish
arms
and
fix
his
eyes
on
mine
and
drag
me
down
down
down
for
was
he
not
alone
omnipotent
on
earth
and
ever
present
even
though
dead
does
not
his
spirit
live
in
all
that
breathe
and
work
for
me
and
mine
still
the
same
ruin
scorn
pain
despair
who
ever
yet
returned
to
teach
the
laws
of
death
untrodden
realm
unjust
perhaps
as
those
which
drive
us
now
oh
whither
whither
lucretia
trust
in
god
sweet
love
the
tender
promises
of
christ
ere
night
think
we
shall
be
in
paradise
beatrice
past
whatever
comes
my
heart
shall
sink
no
more
and
yet
i
know
not
why
your
words
strike
chill
how
tedious
false
and
cold
seem
all
things
i
have
met
with
much
injustice
in
this
world
no
difference
has
been
made
by
god
or
man
or
any
power
moulding
my
wretched
lot
good
or
evil
as
regarded
me
i
am
cut
off
from
the
only
world
i
know
from
light
and
life
and
love
in
youth
sweet
prime
you
do
well
telling
me
to
trust
in
god
i
hope
i
do
trust
in
him
in
whom
else
can
any
trust
and
yet
my
heart
is
cold
during
the
latter
speeches
giacomo
has
retired
conversing
with
camillo
who
now
goes
out
giacomo
advances
giacomo
know
you
not
mother
sister
know
you
not
bernardo
even
now
is
gone
to
implore
the
pope
to
grant
our
pardon
lucretia
child
perhaps
it
will
be
granted
we
may
all
then
live
to
make
these
woes
a
tale
for
distant
years
oh
what
a
thought
it
gushes
to
my
heart
like
the
warm
blood
beatrice
yet
both
will
soon
be
cold
oh
trample
out
that
thought
worse
than
despair
worse
than
the
bitterness
of
death
is
hope
it
is
the
only
ill
which
can
find
place
upon

and

in

ay
that
does

and
yours
i

is
coming

how
often
have
we
done
this
for
one
another
now
we
shall
not
do
it
any
more
my
lord
we
are
quite
ready
well
is
very
well
the
end
note
on
the
cenci
by
shelley
the
sort
of
mistake
that
shelley
made
as
to
the
extent
of
his
own
genius
and
powers
which
led
him
deviously
at
first
but
lastly
into
the
direct
track
that
enabled
him
fully
to
develop
them
is
a
curious
instance
of
his
modesty
of
feeling
and
of
the
methods
which
the
human
mind
uses
at
once
to
deceive
itself
and
yet
in
its
very
delusion
to
make
its
way
out
of
error
into
the
path
which
nature
has
marked
out
as
its
right
one
he
often
incited
me
to
attempt
the
writing
a
tragedy
he
conceived
that
i
possessed
some
dramatic
talent
and
he
was
always
most
earnest
and
energetic
in
his
exhortations
that
i
should
cultivate
any
talent
i
possessed
to
the
utmost
i
entertained
a
truer
estimate
of
my
powers
and
above
all
though
at
that
time
not
exactly
aware
of
the
fact
i
was
far
too
young
to
have
any
chance
of
succeeding
even
moderately
in
a
species
of
composition
that
requires
a
greater
scope
of
experience
in
and
sympathy
with
human
passion
than
could
then
have
fallen
to
my
lot
or
than
any
perhaps
except
shelley
ever
possessed
even
at
the
age
of
at
which
he
wrote
the
cenci
on
the
other
hand
shelley
most
erroneously
conceived
himself
to
be
destitute
of
this
talent
he
believed
that
one
of
the
first
requisites
was
the
capacity
of
forming
and
a
story
or
plot
he
fancied
himself
to
he
defective
in
this
portion
of
imagination
it
was
that
which
gave
him
least
pleasure
in
the
writings
of
others
though
he
laid
great
store
by
it
as
the
proper
framework
to
support
the
sublimest
efforts
of
poetry
he
asserted
that
he
was
too
metaphysical
and
abstract
too
fond
of
the
theoretical
and
the
ideal
to
succeed
as
a
tragedian
it
perhaps
is
not
strange
that
i
shared
this
opinion
with
himself
for
he
had
hitherto
shown
no
inclination
for
nor
given
any
specimen
of
his
powers
in
framing
and
supporting
the
interest
of
a
story
either
in
prose
or
verse
once
or
twice
when
he
attempted
such
he
had
speedily
thrown
it
aside
as
being
even
disagreeable
to
him
as
an
occupation
the
subject
he
had
suggested
for
a
tragedy
was
charles
i
and
he
had
written
to
me
remember
charles
i
have
been
already
imagining
how
you
would
conduct
some
scenes
the
second
volume
of
leon
begins
with
this
proud
and
true
sentiment
there
is
nothing
which
the
human
mind
can
conceive
which
it
may
not
execute
shakespeare
was
only
a
human
being
these
words
were
written
in
while
we
were
in
lombardy
when
he
little
thought
how
soon
a
work
of
his
own
would
prove
a
proud
comment
on
the
passage
he
quoted
when
in
rome
in
a
friend
put
into
our
hands
the
old
manuscript
account
of
the
story
of
the
cenci
we
visited
the
colonna
and
doria
palaces
where
the
portraits
of
beatrice
were
to
be
found
and
her
beauty
cast
the
reflection
of
its
own
grace
over
her
appalling
story
imagination
became
strongly
excited
and
he
urged
the
subject
to
me
as
one
fitted
for
a
tragedy
more
than
ever
i
felt
my
incompetence
but
i
entreated
him
to
write
it
instead
and
he
began
and
proceeded
swiftly
urged
on
by
intense
sympathy
with
the
sufferings
of
the
human
beings
whose
passions
so
long
cold
in
the
tomb
he
revived
and
gifted
with
poetic
language
this
tragedy
is
the
only
one
of
his
works
that
he
communicated
to
me
during
its
progress
we
talked
over
the
arrangement
of
the
scenes
together
i
speedily
saw
the
great
mistake
we
had
made
and
triumphed
in
the
discovery
of
the
new
talent
brought
to
light
from
that
mine
of
wealth
never
alas
through
his
untimely
death
worked
to
its
depths
his
richly
gifted
mind
we
suffered
a
severe
affliction
in
rome
by
the
loss
of
our
eldest
child
who
was
of
such
beauty
and
promise
as
to
cause
him
deservedly
to
be
the
idol
of
our
hearts
we
left
the
capital
of
the
world
anxious
for
a
time
to
escape
a
spot
associated
too
intimately
with
his
presence
and
loss
such
feelings
haunted
him
when
in
the
cenci
he
makes
beatrice
speak
to
cardinal
camillo
of
fair
child
who
was
the
lodestar
of
your
life
and
say
all
see
since
his
most
swift
and
piteous
death
that
day
and
night
and
heaven
and
earth
and
time
and
all
the
things
hoped
for
or
done
therein
are
changed
to
you
through
your
exceeding
grief
some
friends
of
ours
were
residing
in
the
neighbourhood
of
leghorn
and
we
took
a
small
house
villa
valsovano
about
between
the
town
and
monte
nero
where
we
remained
during
the
summer
our
villa
was
situated
in
the
midst
of
a
podere
the
peasants
sang
as
they
worked
beneath
our
windows
during
the
heats
of
a
very
hot
season
and
in
the
evening
the
creaked
as
the
process
of
irrigation
went
on
and
the
fireflies
flashed
from
among
the
myrtle
hedges
nature
was
bright
sunshiny
and
cheerful
or
diversified
by
storms
of
a
majestic
terror
such
as
we
had
never
before
witnessed
at
the
top
of
the
house
there
was
a
sort
of
terrace
there
is
often
such
in
italy
generally
roofed
this
one
was
very
small
yet
not
only
roofed
but
glazed
this
shelley
made
his
study
it
looked
out
on
a
wide
prospect
of
fertile
country
and
commanded
a
view
of
the
near
sea
the
storms
that
sometimes
varied
our
day
showed
themselves
most
picturesquely
as
they
were
driven
across
the
ocean
sometimes
the
dark
lurid
clouds
dipped
towards
the
waves
and
became
that
churned
up
the
waters
beneath
as
they
were
chased
onward
and
scattered
by
the
tempest
at
other
times
the
dazzling
sunlight
and
heat
made
it
almost
intolerable
to
every
other
but
shelley
basked
in
both
and
his
health
and
spirits
revived
under
their
influence
in
this
airy
cell
he
wrote
the
principal
part
of
the
cenci
he
was
making
a
study
of
calderon
at
the
time
reading
his
best
tragedies
with
an
accomplished
lady
living
near
us
to
whom
his
letter
from
leghorn
was
addressed
during
the
following
year
he
admired
calderon
both
for
his
poetry
and
his
dramatic
genius
but
it
shows
his
judgement
and
originality
that
though
greatly
struck
by
his
first
acquaintance
with
the
spanish
poet
none
of
his
peculiarities
crept
into
the
composition
of
the
cenci
and
there
is
no
trace
of
his
new
studies
except
in
that
passage
to
which
he
himself
alludes
as
suggested
by
one
in
el
purgatorio
de
san
patricio
shelley
wished
the
cenci
to
be
acted
he
was
not
a
playgoer
being
of
such
fastidious
taste
that
he
was
easily
disgusted
by
the
bad
of
the
inferior
parts
while
preparing
for
our
departure
from
england
however
he
saw
miss
several
times
she
was
then
in
the
zenith
of
her
glory
and
shelley
was
deeply
moved
by
her
impersonation
of
several
parts
and
by
the
graceful
sweetness
the
intense
pathos
the
sublime
vehemence
of
passion
she
displayed
she
was
often
in
his
thoughts
as
he
wrote
and
when
he
had
finished
he
became
anxious
that
his
tragedy
should
be
acted
and
receive
the
advantage
of
having
this
accomplished
actress
to
fill
the
part
of
the
heroine
with
this
view
he
wrote
the
following
letter
to
a
friend
in
london
object
of
the
present
letter
us
to
ask
a
favour
of
you
i
have
written
a
tragedy
on
a
story
well
known
in
italy
and
in
my
conception
eminently
dramatic
i
have
taken
some
pains
to
make
my
play
fit
for
representation
and
those
who
have
already
seen
it
judge
favourably
it
is
written
without
any
of
the
peculiar
feelings
and
opinions
which
characterize
my
other
compositions
i
have
attended
simply
to
the
impartial
development
of
such
characters
as
it
is
probable
the
persons
represented
really
were
together
with
the
greatest
degree
of
popular
effect
to
be
produced
by
such
a
development
i
send
you
a
translation
of
the
italian
manuscript
on
which
my
play
is
founded
the
chief
circumstance
of
which
i
have
touched
very
delicately
for
my
principal
doubt
as
to
whether
it
would
succeed
as
an
acting
play
hangs
entirely
on
the
question
as
to
whether
any
such
a
thing
as
incest
in
this
shape
however
treated
would
be
admitted
on
the
stage
i
think
however
it
will
form
no
objection
considering
first
that
the
facts
are
matter
of
history
and
secondly
the
peculiar
delicacy
with
which
i
have
treated
it
in
speaking
of
his
mode
of
treating
this
main
incident
shelley
said
that
it
might
be
remarked
that
in
the
course
of
the
play
he
had
never
mentioned
expressly
cenci
worst
crime
every
one
knew
what
it
must
be
but
it
was
never
imaged
in
words
the
nearest
allusion
to
it
being
that
portion
of
cenci
curse
beginning
that
if
she
have
a
child
etc
am
exceedingly
interested
in
the
question
of
whether
this
attempt
of
mine
will
succeed
or
not
i
am
strongly
inclined
to
the
affirmative
at
present
founding
my
hopes
on
this
that
as
a
composition
it
is
certainly
not
inferior
to
any
of
the
modern
plays
that
have
been
acted
with
the
exception
of
remorse
that
the
interest
of
the
plot
is
incredibly
greater
and
more
real
and
that
there
is
nothing
beyond
what
the
multitude
are
contented
to
believe
that
they
can
understand
either
in
imagery
opinion
or
sentiment
i
wish
to
preserve
a
complete
incognito
and
can
trust
to
you
that
whatever
else
you
do
you
will
at
least
favour
me
on
this
point
indeed
this
is
essential
deeply
essential
to
its
success
after
it
had
been
acted
and
successfully
could
i
hope
for
such
a
thing
i
would
own
it
if
i
pleased
and
use
the
celebrity
it
might
acquire
to
my
own
purposes
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
procure
for
me
its
presentation
at
covent
garden
the
principal
character
beatrice
is
precisely
fitted
for
miss
and
it
might
even
seem
to
have
been
written
for
her
god
forbid
that
i
should
see
her
play
it
it
would
tear
my
nerves
to
pieces
and
in
all
respects
it
is
fitted
only
for
covent
garden
the
chief
male
character
i
confess
i
should
be
very
unwilling
that
any
one
but
kean
should
play
that
is
impossible
and
i
must
be
contented
with
an
inferior
actor
the
play
was
accordingly
sent
to
harris
he
pronounced
the
subject
to
be
so
objectionable
that
he
could
not
even
submit
the
part
to
miss
for
perusal
but
expressed
his
desire
that
the
author
would
write
a
tragedy
on
some
other
subject
which
he
would
gladly
accept
shelley
printed
a
small
edition
at
leghorn
to
ensure
its
correctness
as
he
was
much
annoyed
by
the
many
mistakes
that
crept
into
his
text
when
distance
prevented
him
from
correcting
the
press
universal
approbation
soon
stamped
the
cenci
as
the
best
tragedy
of
modern
times
writing
concerning
it
shelley
said
have
been
cautious
to
avoid
the
introducing
faults
of
youthful
composition
diffuseness
a
profusion
of
inapplicable
imagery
vagueness
generality
and
as
hamlet
says
words
words
there
is
nothing
that
is
not
purely
dramatic
throughout
and
the
character
of
beatrice
proceeding
from
vehement
struggle
to
horror
to
deadly
resolution
and
lastly
to
the
elevated
dignity
of
calm
suffering
joined
to
passionate
tenderness
and
pathos
is
touched
with
hues
so
vivid
and
so
beautiful
that
the
poet
seems
to
have
read
intimately
the
secrets
of
the
noble
heart
imaged
in
the
lovely
countenance
of
the
unfortunate
girl
the
fifth
act
is
a
masterpiece
it
is
the
finest
thing
he
ever
wrote
and
may
claim
proud
comparison
not
only
with
any
contemporary
but
preceding
poet
the
varying
feelings
of
beatrice
are
expressed
with
passionate
eloquence
every
character
has
a
voice
that
echoes
truth
in
its
tones
it
is
curious
to
one
acquainted
with
the
written
story
to
mark
the
success
with
which
the
poet
has
inwoven
the
real
incidents
of
the
tragedy
into
his
scenes
and
yet
through
the
power
of
poetry
has
obliterated
all
that
would
otherwise
have
shown
too
harsh
or
too
hideous
in
the
picture
his
success
was
a
double
triumph
and
often
after
he
was
earnestly
entreated
to
write
again
in
a
style
that
commanded
popular
favour
while
it
was
not
less
instinct
with
truth
and
genius
but
the
bent
of
his
mind
went
the
other
way
and
even
when
employed
on
subjects
whose
interest
depended
on
character
and
incident
he
would
start
off
in
another
direction
and
leave
the
delineations
of
human
passion
which
he
could
depict
in
so
able
a
manner
for
fantastic
creations
of
his
fancy
or
the
expression
of
those
opinions
and
sentiments
with
regard
to
human
nature
and
its
destiny
a
desire
to
diffuse
which
was
the
master
passion
of
his
soul
the
mask
of
anarchy
written
on
the
occasion
of
the
massacre
at
manchester
composed
at
the
villa

as
i
lay
asleep
in
italy
there
came
a
voice
from
over
the
sea
and
with
great
power
it
forth
led
me
to
walk
in
the
visions
of
poesy
i
met
murder
on
the
way
he
had
a
mask
like
castlereagh
very
smooth
he
looked
yet
grim
seven
followed
him
all
were
fat
and
well
they
might
be
in
admirable
plight
for
one
by
one
and
two
by
two
he
tossed
them
human
hearts
to
chew
which
from
his
wide
cloak
he
drew
next
came
fraud
and
he
had
on
like
eldon
an
ermined
gown
his
big
tears
for
he
wept
well
turned
to
as
they
fell
and
the
little
children
who
round
his
feet
played
to
and
fro
thinking
every
tear
a
gem
had
their
brains
knocked
out
by
them
clothed
with
the
bible
as
with
light
and
the
shadows
of
the
night
like
sidmouth
next
hypocrisy
on
a
crocodile
rode
by
and
many
more
destructions
played
in
this
ghastly
masquerade
all
disguised
even
to
the
eyes
like
bishops
lawyers
peers
or
spies
last
came
anarchy
he
rode
on
a
white
horse
splashed
with
blood
he
was
pale
even
to
the
lips
like
death
in
the
apocalypse
and
he
wore
a
kingly
crown
and
in
his
grasp
a
sceptre
shone
on
his
brow
this
mark
i
saw
am
god
and
king
and
law
with
a
pace
stately
and
fast
over
english
land
he
passed
trampling
to
a
mire
of
blood
the
adoring
multitude
and
a
mighty
troop
around
with
their
trampling
shook
the
ground
waving
each
a
bloody
sword
for
the
service
of
their
lord
and
with
glorious
triumph
they
rode
through
england
proud
and
gay
drunk
as
with
intoxication
of
the
wine
of
desolation
fields
and
towns
from
sea
to
sea
passed
the
pageant
swift
and
free
tearing
up
and
trampling
down
till
they
came
to
london
town
and
each
dweller
felt
his
heart
with
terror
sicken
hearing
the
tempestuous
cry
of
the
triumph
of
anarchy
for
with
pomp
to
meet
him
came
clothed
in
arms
like
blood
and
flame
the
hired
murderers
who
did
sing
art
god
and
law
and
king
have
waited
weak
and
lone
for
thy
coming
mighty
one
our
purses
are
empty
our
swords
are
cold
give
us
glory
and
blood
and
gold
lawyers
and
priests
a
motley
crowd
to
the
earth
their
pale
brows
bowed
like
a
bad
prayer
not
over
loud
whispering
art
law
and
god
then
all
cried
with
one
accord
art
king
and
god
and
lord
anarchy
to
thee
we
bow
be
thy
name
made
holy
now
and
anarchy
the
skeleton
bowed
and
grinned
to
every
one
as
well
as
if
his
education
had
cost
ten
millions
to
the
nation
for
he
knew
the
palaces
of
our
kings
were
rightly
his
his
the
sceptre
crown
and
globe
and
the
robe
so
he
sent
his
slaves
before
to
seize
upon
the
bank
and
tower
and
was
proceeding
with
intent
to
meet
his
pensioned
parliament
when
one
fled
past
a
maniac
maid
and
her
name
was
hope
she
said
but
she
looked
more
like
despair
and
she
cried
out
in
the
air
father
time
is
weak
and
gray
with
waiting
for
a
better
day
see
how
he
stands
fumbling
with
his
palsied
hands
has
had
child
after
child
and
the
dust
of
death
is
piled
over
every
one
but
me
misery
oh
misery
then
she
lay
down
in
the
street
right
before
the
horses
feet
expecting
with
a
patient
eye
murder
fraud
and
anarchy
when
between
her
and
her
foes
a
mist
a
light
an
image
rose
small
at
first
and
weak
and
frail
like
the
vapour
of
a
vale
till
as
clouds
grow
on
the
blast
like
giants
striding
fast
and
glare
with
lightnings
as
they
fly
and
speak
in
thunder
to
the
sky
it
grew
a
shape
arrayed
in
mail
brighter
than
the
viper
scale
and
upborne
on
wings
whose
grain
was
as
the
light
of
sunny
rain
on
its
helm
seen
far
away
a
planet
like
the
morning
lay
and
those
plumes
its
light
rained
through
like
a
shower
of
crimson
dew
with
step
as
soft
as
wind
it
passed
the
heads
of
men
so
fast
that
they
knew
the
presence
there
and
looked
but
all
was
empty
air
as
flowers
beneath
may
footstep
waken
as
stars
from
night
loose
hair
are
shaken
as
waves
arise
when
loud
winds
call
thoughts
sprung
that
step
did
fall
and
the
prostrate
multitude
looked
and
in
blood
hope
that
maiden
most
serene
was
walking
with
a
quiet
mien
and
anarchy
the
ghastly
birth
lay
dead
earth
upon
the
earth
the
horse
of
death
tameless
as
wind
fled
and
with
his
hoofs
did
grind
to
dust
the
murderers
thronged
behind
a
rushing
light
of
clouds
and
splendour
a
sense
awakening
and
yet
tender
was
heard
and
felt
and
at
its
close
these
words
of
joy
and
fear
arose
as
if
their
own
indignant
earth
which
gave
the
sons
of
england
birth
had
felt
their
blood
upon
her
brow
and
shuddering
with
a
mother
throe
had
turned
every
drop
of
blood
by
which
her
face
had
been
bedewed
to
an
accent
unwithstood
as
if
her
heart
had
cried
aloud
of
england
heirs
of
glory
heroes
of
unwritten
story
nurslings
of
one
mighty
mother
hopes
of
her
and
one
another
like
lions
after
slumber
in
unvanquishable
number
shake
your
chains
to
earth
like
dew
which
in
sleep
had
fallen
on
you
ye
are
many
they
are
few
is
freedom
ye
can
tell
that
which
slavery
is
too
well
for
its
very
name
has
grown
to
an
echo
of
your
own
to
work
and
have
such
pay
as
just
keeps
life
from
day
to
day
in
your
limbs
as
in
a
cell
for
the
tyrants
use
to
dwell
that
ye
for
them
are
made
loom
and
plough
and
sword
and
spade
with
or
without
your
own
will
bent
to
their
defence
and
nourishment
to
see
your
children
weak
with
their
mothers
pine
and
peak
when
the
winter
winds
are
bleak
they
are
dying
whilst
i
speak
to
hunger
for
such
diet
as
the
rich
man
in
his
riot
casts
to
the
fat
dogs
that
lie
surfeiting
beneath
his
eye
to
let
the
ghost
of
gold
take
from
toil
a
thousandfold
more
than
its
substance
could
in
the
tyrannies
of
old
coin
that
forgery
of
the
which
ye
hold
to
something
of
the
worth
of
the
inheritance
of
earth
to
be
a
slave
in
soul
and
to
hold
no
strong
control
over
your
own
wills
but
be
all
that
others
make
of
ye
at
length
when
ye
complain
with
a
murmur
weak
and
vain
to
see
the
tyrant
crew
ride
over
your
wives
and
you
blood
is
on
the
grass
like
dew
it
is
to
feel
revenge
fiercely
thirsting
to
exchange
blood
for
blood
and
wrong
for
wrong
do
not
thus
when
ye
are
strong
find
rest
in
narrow
nest
when
weary
of
their
winged
quest
beasts
find
fare
in
woody
lair
when
storm
and
snow
are
in
the
air
swine
have
litter
spread
and
with
fitting
food
are
fed
all
things
have
a
home
but
one
thou
oh
englishman
hast
none
is
slavery
savage
men
or
wild
beasts
within
a
den

endure
not
as
ye
do
but
such
ills
they
never
knew
art
thou
freedom
o
could
slaves
answer
from
their
living
graves
this
demand
tyrants
would
flee
like
a

dim

not
as
impostors

to

a

of
the
fearless
and
the

on
some
spot
of
english
ground
where
the
plains
stretch
wide
around
the
blue
sky
overhead
the
green
earth
on
which
ye
tread
all
that
must
eternal
be
witness
the
solemnity
the
corners
uttermost
of
the
bounds
of
english
coast
from
every
hut
village
and
town
where
those
who
live
and
suffer
moan
for
others
misery
or
their
own
the
workhouse
and
the
prison
where
pale
as
corpses
newly
risen
women
children
young
and
old
groan
for
pain
and
weep
for
cold
the
haunts
of
daily
life
where
is
waged
the
daily
strife
with
common
wants
and
common
cares
which
sows
the
human
heart
with
tares
from
the
palaces
where
the
murmur
of
distress
echoes
like
the
distant
sound
of
a
wind
alive
around
prison
halls
of
wealth
and
fashion
where
some
few
feel
such
compassion
for
those
who
groan
and
toil
and
wail
as
must
make
their
brethren
pale
who
suffer
woes
untold
or
to
feel
or
to
behold
your
lost
country
bought
and
sold
with
a
price
of

and

a
vast
assembly
be
and
with
great
solemnity
declare
with
measured
words
that
ye
are
as
god
has
made
ye
free
your
strong
and
simple
words
keen
to
wound
as
sharpened
swords
and
wide
as
targes
let
them
be
with
their
shade
to
cover
ye
the
tyrants
pour
around
with
a
quick
and
startling
sound
like
the
loosening
of
a
sea
troops
of
armed
emblazonry
the
charged
artillery
drive
till
the
dead
air
seems
alive
with
the
clash
of
clanging
wheels
and
the
tramp
of
horses
heels
the
fixed
bayonet
gleam
with
sharp
desire
to
wet
its
bright
point
in
english
blood
looking
keen
as
one
for

let
the
horsemen
scimitars
wheel
and
flash
like
sphereless
stars
thirsting
to
eclipse
their
burning
in
a
sea
of
death

mourning
ye
calm

note
on
the
mask
of
anarchy
by
shelley
though
shelley
first
eager
desire
to
excite
his
countrymen
to
resist
openly
the
oppressions
existent
during
good
old
times
had
faded
with
early
youth
still
his
warmest
sympathies
were
for
the
people
he
was
a
republican
and
loved
a
democracy
he
looked
on
all
human
beings
as
inheriting
an
equal
right
to
possess
the
dearest
privileges
of
our
nature
the
necessaries
of
life
when
fairly
earned
by
labour
and
intellectual
instruction
his
hatred
of
any
despotism
that
looked
upon
the
people
as
not
to
be
consulted
or
protected
from
want
and
ignorance
was
intense
he
was
residing
near
leghorn
at
villa
valsovano
writing
the
cenci
when
the
news
of
the
manchester
massacre
reached
us
it
roused
in
him
violent
emotions
of
indignation
and
compassion
the
great
truth
that
the
many
if
accordant
and
resolute
could
control
the
few
as
was
shown
some
years
after
made
him
long
to
teach
his
injured
countrymen
how
to
resist
inspired
by
these
feelings
he
wrote
the
mask
of
anarchy
which
he
sent
to
his
friend
leigh
hunt
to
be
inserted
in
the
examiner
of
which
he
was
then
the
editor
did
not
insert
it
leigh
hunt
writes
in
his
valuable
and
interesting
preface
to
this
poem
when
he
printed
it
in
i
thought
that
the
public
at
large
had
not
become
sufficiently
discerning
to
do
justice
to
the
sincerity
and
of
the
spirit
that
walked
in
this
flaming
robe
of
verse
days
of
outrage
have
passed
away
and
with
them
the
exasperation
that
would
cause
such
an
appeal
to
the
many
to
be
injurious
without
being
aware
of
them
they
at
one
time
acted
on
his
suggestions
and
gained
the
day
but
they
rose
when
human
life
was
respected
by
the
minister
in
power
such
was
not
the
case
during
the
administration
which
excited
abhorrence
the
poem
was
written
for
the
people
and
is
therefore
in
a
more
popular
tone
than
usual
portions
strike
as
abrupt
and
unpolished
but
many
stanzas
are
all
his
own
i
heard
him
repeat
and
admired
those
beginning
father
time
is
old
and
gray
before
i
knew
to
what
poem
they
were
to
belong
but
the
most
touching
passage
is
that
which
describes
the
blessed
effects
of
liberty
it
might
make
a
patriot
of
any
man
whose
heart
was
not
wholly
closed
against
his
humbler

a

peter
bell
a
lyrical
ballad
had
already
appeared
april
a
few
days
before
the
publication
of
wordsworth
peter
bell
a
tale
these
productions
were
reviewed
in
leigh
hunt
examiner
april
may
and
to
the
entertainment
derived
from
his
perusal
of
criticisms
the
composition
of
shelley
peter
bell
the
third
is
chiefly
owing
dedication
to
thomas
brown
the
younger
dear
tom
allow
me
to
request
you
to
introduce
peter
bell
to
the
respectable
family
of
the
fudges
although
he
may
fall
short
of
those
very
considerable
personages
in
the
more
active
properties
which
characterize
the
rat
and
the
apostate
i
suspect
that
even
you
their
historian
will
confess
that
he
surpasses
them
in
the
more
peculiarly
legitimate
qualification
of
intolerable
dulness
you
know
mr
examiner
hunt
well
it
was
he
who
presented
me
to
two
of
the
bells
my
intimacy
with
the
younger
bell
naturally
sprung
from
this
introduction
to
his
brothers
and
in
presenting
him
to
you
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
being
able
to
assure
you
that
he
is
considerably
the
dullest
of
the
three
there
is
this
particular
advantage
in
an
acquaintance
with
any
one
of
the
peter
bells
that
if
you
know
one
peter
bell
you
know
three
peter
bells
they
are
not
one
but
three
not
three
but
one
an
awful
mystery
which
after
having
caused
torrents
of
blood
and
having
been
hymned
by
groans
enough
to
deafen
the
music
of
the
spheres
is
at
length
illustrated
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
parties
in
the
theological
world
by
the
nature
of
peter
bell
peter
is
a
polyhedric
peter
or
a
peter
with
many
sides
he
changes
colours
like
a
chameleon
and
his
coat
like
a
snake
he
is
a
proteus
of
a
peter
he
was
at
first
sublime
pathetic
impressive
profound
then
dull
then
prosy
and
dull
and
now
dull
oh
so
very
dull
it
is
an
dulness
you
will
perceive
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
consider
hell
and
the
devil
as
supernatural
machinery
the
whole
scene
of
my
epic
is
in
world
which
is
so
peter
informed
us
before
his
conversion
to
white
obi
world
of
all
of
us
and
where
we
find
our
happiness
or
not
at
all
let
me
observe
that
i
have
spent
six
or
seven
days
in
composing
this
sublime
piece
the
orb
of
my
moonlike
genius
has
made
the
fourth
part
of
its
revolution
round
the
dull
earth
which
you
inhabit
driving
you
mad
while
it
has
retained
its
calmness
and
its
splendour
and
i
have
been
fitting
this
its
last
phase
occupy
a
permanent
station
in
the
literature
of
my
country
your
works
indeed
dear
tom
sell
better
but
mine
are
far
superior
the
public
is
no
judge
posterity
sets
all
to
rights
allow
me
to
observe
that
so
much
has
been
written
of
peter
bell
that
the
present
history
can
be
considered
only
like
the
iliad
as
a
continuation
of
that
series
of
cyclic
poems
which
have
already
been
candidates
for
bestowing
immortality
upon
at
the
same
time
that
they
receive
it
from
his
character
and
adventures
in
this
point
of
view
i
have
violated
no
rule
of
syntax
in
beginning
my
composition
with

which

the

continued
by

being
like
the
full

at

of

a
full

of
a
very
qualified
import
hoping
that
the
immortality
which
you
have
given
to
the
fudges
you
will
receive
from
them
and
in
the
firm
expectation
that
when
london
shall
be
an
habitation
of
bitterns
when
paul

westminster
abbey
shall
stand
shapeless
and
nameless
ruins
in
the

of
an
unpeopled
marsh
when
the
piers
of
waterloo
bridge
shall
become
the
nuclei
of
islets
of
reeds
and
osiers
and
cast
the
jagged
shadows
of
their
broken
arches
on
the
solitary
stream
some
transatlantic
commentator
will
be
weighing
in
the
scales
of
some
new
and
now
unimagined
system
of
criticism
the

prologue
peter
bells
one
two
and
three
the
wide
world
wandering
first
the
antenatal
peter
wrapped
in
weeds
of
the
same
metre
the
raiment
clothed
in
which
to
walk
his
way
meant
the
second
peter
whose
ambition
is
to
link
the
proposition
as
the
mean
of
two
extremes
this
was
learned
from
aldric
themes
shielding
from
the
guilt
of
schism
the
orthodoxal
syllogism
the
first
peter
he
who
was
like
the
shadow
in
the
glass
of
the
second
yet
unripe
his
substantial
then
came
peter
bell
the
second
who
henceforward
must
be
reckoned
the
body
of
a
double
soul
and
that
portion
of
the
whole
without
which
the
rest
would
seem
ends
of
a
disjointed
and
the
third
is
he
who
has
the
grave
been
forced
to
pass
to
the
other
side
which
is
go
and
try
else
just
like
this
peter
bell
the
first
was
peter
smugger
milder
softer
neater
like
the
soul
before
it
is
born
from
that
world
into
this
the
next
peter
bell
was
he
predevote
like
you
and
me
to
good
or
evil
as
may
come
his
was
the
severer
doom
for
he
was
an
evil
cotter
and
a
polygamic
potter
and
the
last
is
peter
bell
damned
since
our
first
parents
fell
damned
eternally
to
hell
surely
he
deserves
it
well
notes
aldric
aldrich
a
spelling
adopted
here
by
woodberry
the
oldest
scholiasts
read
a
dodecagamic
potter
this
is
at
once
more
descriptive
and
more
megalophonous
but
the
alliteration
of
the
text
had
captivated
the
vulgar
ear
of
the
herd
of
later
shelley
note
part
death
and
peter
bell
when
he
had
been
with
warmed
grew
serious
from
his
dress
and
mien
very
plainly
to
be
seen
peter
was
quite
reformed
his
eyes
turned
up
his
mouth
turned
down
his
accent
caught
a
nasal
twang
he
oiled
his
hair
there
might
be
heard
the
grace
of
god
in
every
word
which
peter
said
or
sang
but
peter
now
grew
old
and
had
an
ill
no
doctor
could
unravel
his
torments
almost
drove
him
mad
some
said
it
was
a
fever
bad
some
swore
it
was
the
gravel
his
holy
friends
then
came
about
and
with
long
preaching
and
persuasion
convinced
the
patient
that
without
the
smallest
shadow
of
a
doubt
he
was
predestined
to
damnation
they
said
name
is
peter
bell
thy
skin
is
of
a
brimstone
hue
alive
or
dead
ay
sick
or
well
the
one
god
made
to
rhyme
with
hell
the
other
i
think
rhymes
with
you
then
peter
set
up
such
a
yell
the
nurse
who
with
some
water
gruel
was
climbing
up
the
stairs
as
well
as
her
old
legs
could
climb
them
fell
and
broke
them
both
the
fall
was
cruel
the
parson
from
the
casement
lept
into
the
lake
of
windermere
and
many
an
eel
though
no
adept
in
god
right
reason
for
it
kept
gnawing
his
kidneys
half
a
year
and
all
the
rest
rushed
through
the
door
and
tumbled
over
one
another
and
broke
their
upon
the
floor
meanwhile
sat
peter
bell
and
swore
and
cursed
his
father
and
his
mother
and
raved
of
god
and
sin
and
death
blaspheming
like
an
infidel
and
said
that
with
his
clenched
teeth
he
seize
the
earth
from
underneath
and
drag
it
with
him
down
to
hell
as
he
was
speaking
came
a
spasm
and
wrenched
his
gnashing
teeth
asunder
like
one
who
sees
a
strange
phantasm
he
lay
there
was
a
silent
chasm
between
his
upper
jaw
and
under
and
yellow
death
lay
on
his
face
and
a
fixed
smile
that
was
not
human
told
as
i
understand
the
case
that
he
was
gone
to
the
wrong
place
i
heard
all
this
from
the
old
woman
then
there
came
down
from
langdale
pike
a
cloud
with
lightning
wind
and
hail
it
swept
over
the
mountains
like
an
ocean
and
i
heard
it
strike
the
woods
and
crags
of
grasmere
vale
and
i
saw
the
black
storm
come
nearer
minute
after
minute
its
thunder
made
the
cataracts
dumb
with
hiss
and
clash
and
hollow
hum
it
neared
as
if
the
devil
was
in
it
the
devil
was
in
it
he
had
bought
peter
for
and
when
the
storm
which
bore
him
vanished
nought
that
in
the
house
that
storm
had
caught
was
ever
seen
again
the
gaping
neighbours
came
next
day
they
found
all
vanished
from
the
shore
the
bible
whence
he
used
to
pray
half
scorched
under
a
lay
smashed
glass
and
nothing
more
part
the
devil
the
devil
i
safely
can
aver
has
neither
hoof
nor
tail
nor
sting
nor
is
he
as
some
sages
swear
a
spirit
neither
here
nor
there
in
nothing
yet
in
everything
he
is
what
we
are
for
sometimes
the
devil
is
a
gentleman
at
others
a
bard
bartering
rhymes
for
sack
a
statesman
spinning
crimes
a
swindler
living
as
he
can
a
thief
who
cometh
in
the
night
with
whole
boots
and
net
pantaloons
like
some
one
whom
it
were
not
right
to
mention
or
the
luckless
wight
from
whom
he
steals
nine
silver
spoons
but
in
this
case
he
did
appear
like
a
from
wapping
and
with
smug
face
and
eye
severe
on
every
side
did
perk
and
peer
till
he
saw
peter
dead
or
napping
he
had
on
an
upper
benjamin
for
he
was
of
the
driving
schism
in
the
which
he
wrapped
his
skin
from
the
storm
he
travelled
in
for
fear
of
rheumatism
he
called
the
ghost
out
of
the
corse
it
was
exceedingly
like
peter
only
its
voice
was
hollow
and
hoarse
it
had
a
queerish
look
of
course
its
dress
too
was
a
little
neater
the
devil
knew
not
his
name
and
lot
peter
knew
not
that
he
was
bell
each
had
an
upper
stream
of
thought
which
made
all
seem
as
it
was
not
fitting
itself
to
all
things
well
peter
thought
he
had
parents
dear
brothers
sisters
cousins
cronies
in
the
fens
of
lincolnshire
he
perhaps
had
found
them
there
had
he
gone
and
boldly
shown
his
solemn
phiz
in
his
own
village
where
he
thought
oft
when
a
boy
he
clomb
the
orchard
walls
to
pillage
the
produce
of
his
neighbour
tillage
with
marvellous
pride
and
joy
and
the
devil
thought
he
had
the
misery
and
confusion
of
an
unjust
war
just
made
a
fortune
by
the
gainful
trade
of
giving
soldiers
rations
bad
the
world
is
full
of
strange
delusion
that
he
had
a
mansion
planned
in
a
square
like
grosvenor
square
that
he
was
aping
fashion
and
that
he
now
came
to
westmoreland
to
see
what
was
romantic
there
and
all
this
though
quite
ideal
ready
at
a
breath
to
vanish
was
a
state
not
more
unreal
than
the
peace
he
could
not
feel
or
the
care
he
could
not
banish
after
a
little
conversation
the
devil
told
peter
if
he
chose
he
bring
him
to
the
world
of
fashion
by
giving
him
a
situation
in
his
own
service
and
new
clothes
and
peter
bowed
quite
pleased
and
proud
and
after
waiting
some
few
days
for
a
new
livery
dirty
yellow
turned
up
with
black
the
wretched
fellow
was
bowled
to
hell
in
the
devil
chaise
part
hell
hell
is
a
city
much
like
london
a
populous
and
a
smoky
city
there
are
all
sorts
of
people
undone
and
there
is
little
or
no
fun
done
small
justice
shown
and
still
less
pity
there
is
a
castles
and
a
canning
a
cobbett
and
a
castlereagh
all
sorts
of
caitiff
corpses
planning
all
sorts
of
cozening
for
trepanning
corpses
less
corrupt
than
they
there
is
a
who
has
lost
his
wits
or
sold
them
none
knows
which
he
walks
about
a
double
ghost
and
though
as
thin
as
fraud
almost
ever
grows
more
grim
and
rich
there
is
a
chancery
court
a
king
a
manufacturing
mob
a
set
of
thieves
who
by
themselves
are
sent
similar
thieves
to
represent
an
army
and
a
public
debt
which
last
is
a
scheme
of
paper

being
interpreted
keep
your
wax
give
us
the
honey
and
we
will
plant
while
skies
are
sunny
flowers
which
in
winter
serve
instead
there
is
a
great
talk
of
revolution
and
a
great
chance
of
despotism
german
soldiers
camps
confusion
tumults
lotteries
rage
delusion
gin
suicide
and
methodism
taxes
too
on
wine

meat

from
which
those
patriots
pure
are
fed
who
gorge

of
all
these

are
mincing

is
over

all
that

grows
cruel

such
a

each
with

all
these

at

where
small

dies
in
agonies

service

would
swear
that
every

in

there
to

would

peter

now

was
not
what
peter
was
before
damnation
men
oftentimes
prepare
a
lot
which
ere
it
finds
them
is
not
what
suits
with
their
genuine
station
all
things
that
peter
saw
and
felt
had
a
peculiar
aspect
to
him
and
when
they
came
within
the
belt
of
his
own
nature
seemed
to
melt
like
cloud
to
cloud
into
him
and
so
the
outward
world
uniting
to
that
within
him
he
became
considerably
uninviting
to
those
who
meditation
slighting
were
moulded
in
a
different
frame
and
he
scorned
them
and
they
scorned
him
and
he
scorned
all
they
did
and
they
did
all
that
men
of
their
own
trim
are
wont
to
do
to
please
their
whim
drinking
lying
swearing
play
such
were
his
thus
his
virtue
like
our
own
was
built
too
much
on
that
indignant
fuss
hypocrite
pride
stirs
up
in
us
to
bully
one
another
guilt
he
had
a
mind
which
was
somehow
at
once
circumference
and
centre
of
all
he
might
or
feel
or
know
nothing
went
ever
out
although
something
did
ever
enter
he
had
as
much
imagination
as
a
he
never
could
fancy
another
situation
from
which
to
dart
his
contemplation
than
that
wherein
he
stood
yet
his
was
individual
mind
and
new
created
all
he
saw
in
a
new
manner
and
refined
those
new
creations
and
combined
them
by
a
law
thus
though
unimaginative
an
apprehension
clear
intense
of
his
mind
work
had
made
alive
the
things
it
wrought
on
i
believe
wakening
a
sort
of
thought
in
sense
but
from
the
first
was
peter
drift
to
be
a
kind
of
moral
eunuch
he
touched
the
hem
of
nature
shift
felt
faint
and
never
dared
uplift
the
closest
tunic
she
laughed
the
while
with
an
arch
smile
and
kissed
him
with
a
sister
kiss
and
said
my
best
diogenes
i
love
you
well
but
if
you
please
tempt
not
again
my
deepest
bliss
you
are
cold
for
i
not
coy
yield
love
for
love
frank
warm
and
true
and
burns
a
scottish
peasant
boy
his
errors
prove
it
knew
my

more
learned

than
you
bacciata
non
perde
ventura
anzi

so
thought
boccaccio
whose
sweet
words
might
cure
a
male
prude
like
you
from
what
you
now
endure
a
in
soul
like
a
stagnant
laguna
then
peter
rubbed
his
eyes
severe
and
smoothed
his
spacious
forehead
down
with
his
broad
palm
love
and
fear
he
looked
as
he
no
doubt
felt
queer
and
in
his
dream
sate
down
the
devil
was
no
uncommon
creature
a
thief
just
huddled
out
of
the
dross
and
scum
of
nature
a
lump
of
limb
and
feature
with
mind
and
heart
and
fancy
muddled
he
was
that
heavy
dull
cold
thing
the
spirit
of
evil
well
may
be
a
drone
too
base
to
have
a
sting
who
gluts
and
grimes
his
lazy
wing
and
calls
lust
luxury
now
he
was
quite
the
kind
of
wight
round
whom
collect
at
a
fixed
aera
venison
turtle
hock
and
claret
good
cheer
and
those
who
come
to
share
it
and
best
east
indian
madeira
it
was
his
fancy
to
invite
men
of
science
wit
and
learning
who
came
to
lend
each
other
light
he
proudly
thought
that
his
gold
might
had
set
those
spirits
burning
and
men
of
learning
science
wit
considered
him
as
you
and
i
think
of
some
rotten
tree
and
sit
lounging
and
dining
under
it
exposed
to
the
wide
sky
and
all
the
while
with
loose
fat
smile
the
willing
wretch
sat
winking
there
believing
was
his
power
that
made
that
jovial
scene
and
that
all
paid
homage
to
his
unnoticed
chair
though
to
be
sure
this
place
was
hell
he
was
the
devil
and
all
they
what
though
the
claret
circled
well
and
wit
like
ocean
rose
and
fell
were
damned
eternally
part
grace
among
the
guests
who
often
stayed
till
the
devil
a
man
there
came
fair
as
a
maid
and
peter
noted
what
he
said
standing
behind
his
master
chair
he
was
a
mighty
poet
and
a
psychologist
all
things
he
seemed
to
understand
of
old
or
new
of
sea
or
land
but
his
own
mind
which
was
a
mist
this
was
a
man
who
might
have
turned
hell
into
heaven
and
so
in
gladness
a
heaven
unto
himself
have
earned
but
he
in
shadows
undiscerned
and
damned
himself
to
madness
he
spoke
of
poetry
and
how
it
was
a
light
a
love
a
spirit
which
like
wind
doth
blow
as
it
listeth
to
and
fro
a
dew
rained
down
from
god
above
power
which
comes
and
goes
like
dream
and
which
none
can
ever
trace
heaven
light
on
earth
truth
brightest
beam
and
when
he
ceased
there
lay
the
gleam
of
those
words
upon
his
face
now
peter
when
he
heard
such
talk
would
heedless
of
a
broken
pate
stand
like
a
man
asleep
or
balk
some
wishing
guest
of
knife
or
fork
or
drop
and
break
his
master
plate
at
night
he
oft
would
start
and
wake
like
a
lover
and
began
in
a
wild
measure
songs
to
make
on
moor
and
glen
and
rocky
lake
and
on
the
heart
of
man
and
on
the
universal
sky
and
the
wide
earth
bosom
green
and
the
sweet
strange
mystery
of
what
beyond
these
things
may
lie
and
yet
remain
unseen
for
in
his
thought
he
visited
the
spots
in
which
ere
dead
and
damned
he
his
wayward
life
had
led
yet
knew
not
whence
the
thoughts
were
fed
which
thus
his
fancy
crammed
and
these
obscure
remembrances
stirred
such
harmony
in
peter
that
whensoever
he
should
please
he
could
speak
of
rocks
and
trees
in
poetic
metre
for
though
it
was
without
a
sense
of
memory
yet
he
remembered
well
many
a
ditch
and
fence
of
lakes
he
had
intelligence
he
knew
something
of
heath
and
fell
he
had
also
dim
recollections
of
pedlars
tramping
on
their
rounds
and
pails
and
odd
collections
of
saws
and
proverbs
and
reflections
old
parsons
make
in
but
peter
verse
was
clear
and
came
announcing
from
the
frozen
hearth
of
a
cold
age
that
none
might
tame
the
soul
of
that
diviner
flame
it
augured
to
the
earth
like
gentle
rains
on
the
dry
plains
making
that
green
which
late
was
gray
or
like
the
sudden
moon
that
stains
some
gloomy
chamber
with
a
broad
light
like
day
for
language
was
in
peter
hand
like
clay
while
he
was
yet
a
potter
and
he
made
songs
for
all
the
land
sweet
both
to
feel
and
understand
as
pipkins
late
to
mountain
cotter
and
the
bookseller
gave
twenty
pounds
for
some
then
scorning
a
footman
yellow
coat
to
wear
peter
too
proud
of
heart
i
fear
instantly
gave
the
devil
warning
whereat
the
devil
took
offence
and
swore
in
his
soul
a
great
oath
then
for
his
damned
impertinence
he
bring
him
to
a
proper
sense
of
what
was
due
to
gentlemen
part
damnation
that
mine
enemy
had
written
a
book
cried
job
a
fearful
curse
if
to
the
arab
as
the
briton
galling
to
be
the
devil
to
peter
wished
no
worse
when
peter
next
new
book
found
vent
the
devil
to
all
the
first
reviews
a
copy
of
it
slyly
sent
with
note
as
compliment
and
this
short
notice
abuse
then
seriatim
month
and
quarter
appeared
such
mad
one
said
seduced
foy
daughter
then
drowned
the
mother
in
ullswater
the
last
thing
as
he
went
to
bed
another
him

his
head
where
dr

or
is
he
joking
what
does
the
rascal
mean
or
hope
no
longer
imitating
pope
in
that
barbarian
shakespeare
poking
one
more
incest
not
enough
and
must
there
be
adultery
too
grace
after
meat
miscreant
and
liar
thief
blackguard
scoundrel
fool
is
twenty
times
too
good
for
you
that
last
book
of
yours
we
think
you
double
damned
yourself
to
scorn
we
warned
you
whilst
yet
on
the
brink
you
stood
from
your
black
name
will
shrink
the
babe
that
is
unborn
all
these
reviews
the
devil
made
up
in
a
parcel
which
he
had
safely
to
peter
house
conveyed
for
carriage
tenpence
peter
paid
untied
them
read
them
went
half
mad
cried
he
is
my
reward
for
nights
of
thought
and
days
of
toil
do
poets
but
to
be
abhorred
by
men
of
whom
they
never
heard
consume
their
spirits
oil
have
i
done
to
them
and
who
is
foy
is
very
cruel
to
speak
of
me
and
betty
so
adultery
god
defend
me
oh
i
half
a
mind
to
fight
a
duel
cried
he
a
grave
look
collecting
it
my
genius
like
the
moon
sets
those
who
stand
her
face
inspecting
that
face
within
their
brain
reflecting
like
a
crazed
out
of
tune
for
peter
did
not
know
the
town
but
thought
as
country
readers
do
for
half
a
guinea
or
a
crown
he
bought
oblivion
or
renown
from
god
own
voice
in
a
review
all
peter
did
on
this
occasion
was
writing
some
sad
stuff
in
prose
it
is
a
dangerous
invasion
when
poets
criticize
their
station
is
to
delight
not
pose
the
devil
then
sent
to
leipsic
fair
for
born
translation
of
kant
book
a
world
of
words
tail
foremost
where
right
wrong
false
true
and
foul
and
fair
as
in
a
are
shook
five
thousand
crammed
octavo
pages
of
german
psychologics
he
who
his
furor
verborum
assuages
thereon
deserves
just
seven
months
wages
more
than
will
be
due
to
me
i
looked
on
them
nine
several
days
and
then
i
saw
that
they
were
bad
a
friend
too
spoke
in
their
dispraise
he
never
read
them
with
amaze
i
found
sir
william
drummond
had
when
the
book
came
the
devil
sent
it
to
verbovale
esquire
with
a
brief
note
of
compliment
by
that
night
carlisle
mail
it
went
and
set
his
soul
on
fire
fire
which
ex
luce
praebens
fumum
made
him
beyond
the
bottom
see
of
truth
clear
well
when
i
and
you
go
as
we
shall
do
subter
humum
we
may
know
more
than
he
now
peter
ran
to
seed
in
soul
into
a
walking
paradox
for
he
was
neither
part
nor
whole
nor
good
nor
bad
nor
knave
nor
fool
among
the
woods
and
rocks
furious
he
rode
where
late
he
ran
lashing
and
spurring
his
tame
hobby
turned
to
a
formal
puritan
a
solemn
and
unsexual
man
he
half
believed
white
obi
this
steed
in
vision
he
would
ride
high
trotting
over
bridges
with
flibbertigibbet
imp
of
pride
mocking
and
mowing
by
his
side
a
goblin
for
a
guide
over
gates
and
hedges
after
these
ghastly
rides
he
came
home
to
his
heart
and
found
from
thence
much
stolen
of
its
accustomed
flame
his
thoughts
grew
weak
drowsy
and
lame
of
their
intelligence
to
peter
view
all
seemed
one
hue
he
was
no
whig
he
was
no
tory
no
deist
and
no
christian
he
he
got
so
subtle
that
to
be
nothing
was
all
his
glory
one
single
point
in
his
belief
from
his
organization
sprung
the
faith
the
chief
ear
in
his
doctrines
blighted
sheaf
that
is
wrong
so
thought
calvin
and
dominic
so
think
their
fierce
successors
who
even
now
would
neither
stint
nor
stick
our
flesh
from
off
our
bones
to
pick
if
they
might
their
do
his
morals
thus
were
undermined
the
old
peter
the
hard
old
potter
was
born
anew
within
his
mind
he
grew
dull
harsh
sly
unrefined
as
when
he
tramped
beside
the
otter
in
the
death
hues
of
agony
lambently
flashing
from
a
fish
now
peter
felt
amused
to
see
shades
like
a
rainbow
rise
and
flee
mixed
with
a
certain
hungry
wish
so
in
his
country
dying
face
he
looked
and
lovely
as
she
lay
seeking
in
vain
his
last
embrace
wailing
her
own
abandoned
case
with
hardened
sneer
he
turned
away
and
coolly
to
his
own
soul
said
you
not
think
that
we
might
make
a
poem
on
her
when
she
dead
or
no
a
thought
is
in
my
head
her
shroud
for
a
new
sheet
i
take
wife
wants
let
who
will
bury
this
mangled
corpse
and
i
and
you
my
dearest
soul
will
then
make
merry
as
the
prince
regent
did
with
sherry
and
at
last
desert
me
too
and
so
his
soul
would
not
be
gay
but
moaned
within
him
like
a
fawn
moaning
within
a
cave
it
lay
wounded
and
wasting
day
by
day
till
all
its
life
of
life
was
gone
as
troubled
skies
stain
waters
clear
the
storm
in
peter
heart
and
mind
now
made
his
verses
dark
and
queer
they
were
the
ghosts
of
what
they
were
shaking
dim
in
the
wind
for
he
now
raved
enormous
folly
of
baptisms
and
graves
make
george
colman
melancholy
to
have
heard
him
like
a
male
molly
chanting
those
stupid
staves
yet
the
reviews
who
heaped
abuse
on
peter
while
he
wrote
for
freedom
so
soon
as
in
his
song
they
spy
the
folly
which
soothes
tyranny
praise
him
for
those
who
feed
was
a
man
too
great
to
scan
a
planet
lost
in
truth
keen
rays
his
virtue
awful
and
prodigious
he
was
the
most
sublime
religious
poet
of
these
days
as
soon
as
he
read
that
cried
peter
i
have
found
the
way
to
make
a
better
thing
of
metre
than
was
made
by
living
creature
up
to
this
blessed
day
then
peter
wrote
odes
to
the
devil
in
one
of
which
he
meekly
said
carnage
and
slaughter
thy
niece
and
thy
daughter
may
rapine
and
famine
thy
gorge
ever
cramming
glut
thee
with
living
and
dead
death
and
damnation
and
consternation
flit
up
from
hell
with
pure
intent
slash
them
at
manchester
glasgow
leeds
and
chester
drench
all
with
blood
from
avon
to
trent
thy
yeomen
hew
down
babes
and
women
and
laugh
with
bold
triumph
till
heaven
be
rent
when
moloch
in
jewry
munched
children
with
fury
it
was
thou
devil
dining
with
pure
intent
part
double
damnation
the
devil
now
knew
his
proper
soon
as
he
read
the
ode
he
drove
to
his
friend
lord
macmurderchouse
a
man
of
interest
in
both
houses
and
said
money
or
for
love
find
some
cure
or
sinecure
to
feed
from
the
superfluous
taxes
a
friend
of
ours
a
poet
fewer
have
fluttered
tamer
to
the
lure
than
he
his
lordship
stands
and
racks
his
stupid
brains
while
one
might
count
as
many
beads
as
he
had
boroughs
at
length
replies
from
his
mean
front
like
one
who
rubs
out
an
account
smoothing
away
the
unmeaning
furrows
happens
fortunately
dear
sir
i
can
i
hope
i
need
require
no
pledge
from
you
that
he
will
stir
in
our
affairs
like
oliver
that
he
be
worthy
of
his
hire
these
words
exchanged
the
news
sent
off
to
peter
home
the
devil
hied
took
to
his
bed
he
had
no
cough
no
doctor
meat
and
drink
yet
that
same
night
he
died
the
devil
corpse
was
leaded
down
his
decent
heirs
enjoyed
his
pelf
many
a
one
followed
his
hearse
along
the
town
where
was
the
devil
himself
when
peter
heard
of
his
promotion
his
eyes
grew
like
two
stars
for
bliss
there
was
a
bow
of
sleek
devotion
engendering
in
his
back
each
motion
seemed
a
lord
shoe
to
kiss
he
hired
a
house
bought
plate
and
made
a
genteel
drive
up
to
his
door
with
sifted
gravel
neatly
laid
as
if
defying
all
who
said
peter
was
ever
poor
but
a
disease
soon
struck
into
the
very
life
and
soul
of
peter
he
walked
about
slept
had
the
hue
of
health
upon
his
cheeks
and
few
dug
better
none
a
heartier
eater
and
yet
a
strange
and
horrid
curse
clung
upon
peter
night
and
day
month
after
month
the
thing
grew
worse
and
deadlier
than
in
this
my
verse
i
can
find
strength
to
say
peter
was
dull
he
was
at
first
dull
oh
so
dull
so
very
dull
whether
he
talked
wrote
or
rehearsed
still
with
this
dulness
was
he
cursed
dull
beyond
all
conception
dull
no
one
could
read
his
books
no
mortal
but
a
few
natural
friends
would
hear
him
the
parson
came
not
near
his
portal
his
state
was
like
that
of
the
immortal
described
by
swift
no
man
could
bear
him
his
sister
wife
and
children
yawned
with
a
long
slow
and
drear
ennui
all
human
patience
far
beyond
their
hopes
of
heaven
each
would
have
pawned
anywhere
else
to
be
but
in
his
verse
and
in
his
prose
the
essence
of
his
dulness
was
concentred
and
compressed
so
close
have
made
guatimozin
doze
on
his
red
gridiron
of
brass
a
printer
boy
folding
those
pages
fell
slumbrously
upon
one
side
like
those
famed
seven
who
slept
three
ages
to
wakeful
frenzy
vigil
rages
as
opiates
were
the
same
applied
even
the
reviewers
who
were
hired
to
do
the
work
of
his
reviewing
with
adamantine
nerves
grew
tired
gaping
and
torpid
they
retired
to
dream
of
what
they
should
be
doing
and
worse
and
worse
the
drowsy
curse
yawned
in
him
till
it
grew
a
pest
a
wide
contagious
atmosphere
creeping
like
cold
through
all
things
near
a
power
to
infect
and
to
infest
his
and
dogs
grew
dull
his
kitten
late
a
sportive
elf
the
woods
and
lakes
so
beautiful
of
dim
stupidity
were
full
all
grew
dull
as
peter
self
the
earth
under
his
feet
the
springs
which
lived
within
it
a
quick
life
the
air
the
winds
of
many
wings
that
fan
it
with
new
murmurings
were
dead
to
their
harmonious
strife
the
birds
and
beasts
within
the
wood
the
insects
and
each
creeping
thing
were
now
a
silent
multitude
love
work
was
left
unwrought
no
brood
near
peter
house
took
wing
and
every
neighbouring
cottager
stupidly
yawned
upon
the
other
no
jackass
brayed
no
little
cur
cocked
up
his
ears
no
man
would
stir
to
save
a
dying
mother
yet
all
from
that
charmed
district
went
but
some
and
who
rather
than
pay
any
rent
would
live
with
marvellous
content
over
his
father
grave
no
bailiff
dared
within
that
space
for
fear
of
the
dull
charm
to
enter
a
man
would
bear
upon
his
face
for
fifteen
months
in
any
case
the
yawn
of
such
a
venture
seven
miles
above
below
around
this
pest
of
dulness
holds
its
sway
a
ghastly
life
without
a
sound
to
peter
soul
the
spell
is
bound
how
should
it
ever
pass
away
notes
to
those
who
have
not
duly
appreciated
the
distinction
between
whale
and
russia
oil
this
attribute
might
rather
seem
to
belong
to
the
dandy
than
the
evangelic
the
effect
when
to
the
windward
is
indeed
so
similar
that
it
requires
a
subtle
naturalist
to
discriminate
the
animals
they
belong
however
to
distinct
shelley
note
one
of
the
attributes
in
linnaeus
description
of
the
cat
to
a
similar
cause
the
caterwauling
of
more
than
one
species
of
this
genus
is
to
be
referred
except
indeed
that
the
poor
quadruped
is
compelled
to
quarrel
with
its
own
pleasures
whilst
the
biped
is
supposed
only
to
quarrel
with
those
of
shelley
note
what
would
this
husk
and
excuse
for
a
virtue
be
without
its
kernel
prostitution
or
the
kernel
prostitution
without
this
husk
of
a
virtue
i
wonder
the
women
of
the
town
do
not
form
an
association
like
the
society
for
the
suppression
of
vice
for
the
support
of
what
may
be
called
the
church
and
constitution
of
their
order
but
this
subject
is
almost
too
horrible
for
a
shelley
note
this
libel
on
our
national
oath
and
this

curious
to
observe
how

peter
is
indeed
a
sort
of

cobbett
is
however
more
mischievous
than
peter
because
he
pollutes
a

how
unconquerable

on
peter
bell
the
third
by
shelley
in
this
new
edition
i
have
added
peter
bell
the
third
a
critique
on
wordsworth
peter
bell
reached
us
at
leghorn
which
amused
shelley
exceedingly
and
suggested
this
poem
i
need
scarcely
observe
that
nothing
personal
to
the
author
of
peter
bell
is
intended
in
this
poem
no
man
ever
admired
poetry
more
he
read
it
perpetually
and
taught
others
to
appreciate
its
beauties
this
poem
is
like
all
others
written
by
shelley
ideal
he
conceived
the
idealism
of
a
poet
a
man
of
lofty
and
creative
genius
quitting
the
glorious
calling
of
discovering
and
announcing
the
beautiful
and
good
to
support
and
propagate
ignorant
prejudices
and
pernicious
errors
imparting
to
the
unenlightened
not
that
ardour
for
truth
and
spirit
of
toleration
which
shelley
looked
on
as
the
sources
of
the
moral
improvement
and
happiness
of
mankind
but
false
and
injurious
opinions
that
evil
was
good
and
that
ignorance
and
force
were
the
best
allies
of
purity
and
virtue
his
idea
was
that
a
man
gifted
even
as
transcendently
as
the
author
of
peter
bell
with
the
highest
qualities
of
genius
must
if
he
fostered
such
errors
be
infected
with
dulness
this
poem
was
written
as
a
warning
not
as
a
narration
of
the
reality
he
was
unacquainted
personally
with
wordsworth
or
with
coleridge
to
whom
he
alludes
in
the
fifth
part
of
the
poem
and
therefore
i
repeat
his
poem
is
purely
ideal
it
contains
something
of
criticism
on
the
compositions
of
those
great
poets
but
nothing
injurious
to
the
men
themselves
no
poem
contains
more
of
shelley
peculiar
views
with
regard
to
the
errors
into
which
many
of
the
wisest
have
fallen
and
the
pernicious
effects
of
certain
opinions
on
society
much
of
it
is
beautifully
written
and
though
like
the
burlesque
drama
of
swellfoot
it
must
be
looked
on
as
a
plaything
it
has
so
much
merit
and
poetry
so
much
of
himself
in
it
that
it
can
not
fail
to
interest
greatly
and
by
right
belongs
to
the
world

whose
instruction

in
this

a
pretty
bowl
of
wood
not
full
of
wine
but
quicksilver
that
dew
which
the
gnomes
drink
when
at
their
subterranean
toil
they
swink
pledging
the
demons
of
the
earthquake
who
reply
to
them
in

cry
halloo
and
call
out
to
the

their

the
dying

all

their

this
quicksilver
no
gnome
has
drunk
within
the
walnut
bowl
it
lies
veined
and
thin
in
colour
like
the
wake
of
light
that
stains
the
tuscan
deep
when
from
the
moist
moon
rains
the
inmost
shower
of
its
white
fire
the
breeze
is
still
blue
heaven
smiles
over
the
pale
seas
and
in
this
bowl
of
quicksilver
for
i
yield
to
the
impulse
of
an
infancy
outlasting
manhood
i
have
made
to
float
a
rude
idealism

a
queer
broken
glass
with

the
of

round

an
inconstant
and

idle
sound

heed
him
more
than
them
the
is
gathering
on
the
mountains
like
a
cloak
folded
athwart
their
shoulders
broad
and
bare
the
ripe
corn
under
the
undulating
air
undulates
like
an
ocean
and
the
vines
are
trembling
wide
in
all
their
trellised
lines
the
murmur
of
the
awakening
sea
doth
fill
the
empty
pauses
of
the
blast
the
hill
looks
hoary
through
the
white
electric
rain
and
from
the
glens
beyond
in
sullen
strain
the
interrupted
thunder
howls
above
one
chasm
of
heaven
smiles
like
the
eye
of
love
on
the
unquiet
world
while
such
things
are
how
could
one
worth

friendship
heed
the
war
of
worms
the
shriek
of
the
world
carrion
jays
their
censure
or
their
wonder
or
their
praise
you
are
not
here
the
quaint
witch
memory
sees
in
vacant
chairs
your
absent
images
and
points
where
once
you
sat
and
now
should
be
but
are
i
demand
if
ever
we
shall
meet
as
then
we
met
and
she
replies
veiling
in
awe
her
eyes
know
the
past
alone
but
summon
home
my
sister
hope
she
speaks
of
all
to
come
but
i
an
old
diviner
who
knew
well
every
false
verse
of
that
sweet
oracle
turned
to
the
sad
enchantress
once
again
and
sought
a
respite
from
my
gentle
pain
in
citing
every
passage
and
of
our
communion
how
on
the
we
watched
the
ocean
and
the
sky
together
under
the
roof
of
blue
italian
weather
how
i
ran
home
through
last
year
and
felt
the
transverse
lightning
linger
warm
upon
my
cheek
and
how
we
often
made
feasts
for
each
other
where
good
will
outweighed
the
frugal
luxury
of
our
country
cheer
as
well
it
might
were
it
less
firm
and
clear
than
ours
must
ever
be
and
how
we
spun
a
shroud
of
talk
to
hide
us
from
the
sun
of
this
familiar
life
which
seems
to
be
but
is
not
or
is
but
quaint
mockery
of
all
we
would
believe
and
sadly
blame
the
jarring
and
inexplicable
frame
of
this
wrong
world
and
then
anatomize
the
purposes
and
thoughts
of
men
whose
eyes
were
closed
in
distant
years
or
widely
guess
the
issue
of
the
earth
great
business
when
we
shall
be
as
we
no
longer
are
like
babbling
gossips
safe
who
hear
the
war
of
winds
and
sigh
but
tremble
not
or
how
you
listened
to
some
interrupted
flow
of
visionary
rhyme
in
joy
and
pain
struck
from
the
inmost
fountains
of
my
brain
with
little
skill
perhaps
or
how
we
sought
those
deepest
wells
of
passion
or
of
thought
wrought
by
wise
poets
in
the
waste
of
years
staining
their
sacred
waters
with
our
tears
quenching
a
thirst
ever
to
be
renewed

how
i
wisest
lady
then
endued
the
language
of
a
land
which
now
is
free
and
winged
with
thoughts
of
truth
and
majesty
flits
round
the
tyrant
sceptre
like
a
cloud
and
bursts
the
peopled
prisons
and
cries
aloud
name
is
legion
that
majestic
tongue
which
calderon
over
the
desert
flung
of
ages
and
of
nations
and
which
found
an
echo
in
our
hearts
and
with
the
sound
startled
oblivion
thou
wert
then
to
me
as
is
a
nurse
when
inarticulately
a
child
would
talk
as
its
grown
parents
do
if
living
winds
the
rapid
clouds
pursue
if
hawks
chase
doves
through
the
aethereal
way
huntsmen
the
innocent
deer
and
beasts
their
prey
why
should
not
we
rouse
with
the
spirit
blast
out
of
the
forest
of
the
pathless
past
these
recollected
pleasures
you
are
now
in
london
that
great
sea
whose
ebb
and
flow
at
once
is
deaf
and
loud
and
on
the
shore
vomits
its
wrecks
and
still
howls
on
for
more
yet
in
its
depth
what
treasures
you
will
see
that
which
was
godwin
greater
none
than
he
though
fallen
and
fallen
on
evil
times
to
stand
among
the
spirits
of
our
age
and
land
before
the
dread
tribunal
of
to
come
the
foremost
while
rebuke
cowers
pale
and
dumb
you
will
see
coleridge
he
who
sits
obscure
in
the
exceeding
lustre
and
the
pure
intense
irradiation
of
a
mind
which
with
its
own
internal
lightning
blind
flags
wearily
through
darkness
and
despair
a
meteor
of
the
air
a
hooded
eagle
among
blinking
you
will
see
hunt
one
of
those
happy
souls
which
are
the
salt
of
the
earth
and
without
whom
this
world
would
smell
like
what
it
is
a
tomb
who
is
what
others
seem
his
room
no
doubt
is
still
adorned
with
many
a
cast
from
shout
with
graceful
flowers
tastefully
placed
about
and
coronals
of
bay
from
ribbons
hung
and
brighter
wreaths
in
neat
disorder
flung
the
gifts
of
the
most
learned
among
some
dozens
of
female
friends
and
cousins
and
there
is
he
with
his
eternal
puns
which
beat
the
dullest
brain
for
smiles
like
duns
thundering
for
money
at
a
poet
door
alas
it
is
no
use
to

poor

you
will
see

and
i
can
not
express

virtues
though
i
know
that
they
are

because
he
locks
then
barricades
the
gate
within
which
they
inhabit
of
his

you
cry
out
when
you

in
that
just
wit
and
sense
virtue
and
human
knowledge
all
that
might
make
this
dull
world
a
business
of
delight
are
all
combined
in
horace
and
these
with
some
exceptions
which
i
need
not
tease
your
patience
by
descanting
on
are
all
you
and
i
know
in
london
i
recall
my
thoughts
and
bid
you
look
upon
the
night
as
water
does
a
sponge
so
the
moonlight
fills
the
void
hollow
universal
air
what
see
you
unpavilioned
heaven
is
fair
whether
the
moon
into
her
chamber
gone
leaves
midnight
to
the
golden
stars
or
wan
climbs
with
diminished
beams
the
azure
steep
or
whether
clouds
sail
the
inverse
deep
piloted
by
the
blast
and
the
rare
stars
rush
through
them
dim
and
fast
all
this
is
beautiful
in
every
but
what
see
you
beside
a
shabby
stand
of
hackney
coaches
a
brick
house
or
wall
fencing
some
lonely
court
white
with
the
scrawl
of
our
unhappy
politics
or
worse
a
wretched
woman
reeling
by
whose
curse
mixed
with
the
watchman
partner
of
her
trade
you
must
accept
in
place
of
serenade
or
pollonia
murmuring
to
henry
some
unutterable
thing
i
see
a
chaos
of
green
leaves
and
fruit
built
round
dark
caverns
even
to
the
root
of
the
living
stems
that
feed
them
in
whose
bowers
there
sleep
in
their
dark
dew
the
folded
flowers
beyond
the
surface
of
the
unsickled
corn
trembles
not
in
the
slumbering
air
and
borne
in
circles
quaint
and
dance
like
winged
stars
the
flash
and
glance
pale
in
the
open
moonshine
but
each
one
under
the
dark
trees
seems
a
little
sun
a
meteor
tamed
a
fixed
star
gone
astray
from
the
silver
regions
of
the
milky
way
afar
the
contadino
song
is
heard
rude
but
made
sweet
by
distance
and
a
bird
which
can
not
be
the
nightingale
and
yet
i
know
none
else
that
sings
so
sweet
as
it
at
this
late
hour
and
then
all
is
still
now
italy
or
london
which
you
will
next

you
must
pass
with
me
i
have
my

by

turned
into
a
grave
of
dead
despondence
and
care
and
all
the
dreams
which
our
tormentors
are
oh
that
hunt
hogg
peacock
and
smith
were
there
with
everything
belonging
to
them
fair
we
will
have
books
spanish
italian
greek
and
ask
one
week
to
make
another
week
as
like
his
father
as
i
unlike
mine
which
is
not
his
fault
as
you
may
divine
though
we
eat
little
flesh
and
drink
no
wine
yet
let
be
merry
we
have
tea
and
toast
custards
for
supper
and
an
endless
host
of
syllabubs
and
jellies
and
and
other
such
luxuries
feasting
on
which
we
will
philosophize
and
we
have
fires
out
of
the
grand
duke
wood
to
thaw
the
six
weeks
winter
in
our
blood
and
then
we
talk
what

we
talk
about
oh
there
are
themes
enough
for
many
a

the
witch
of
atlas
before
those
cruel
twins
whom
at
one
birth
incestuous
change
bore
to
her
father
time
error
and
truth
had
hunted
from
the
earth
all
those
bright
natures
which
adorned
its
prime
and
left
us
nothing
to
believe
in
worth
the
pains
of
putting
into
learned
rhyme
a
there
lived
on
atlas
mountain
within
a
cavern
by
a
secret
fountain
her
mother
was
one
of
the
atlantides
the
sun
had
beholden
in
his
wide
voyage
continents
and
seas
so
fair
a
creature
as
she
lay
enfolden
in
the
warm
shadow
of
her
loveliness
he
kissed
her
with
his
beams
and
made
all
golden
the
chamber
of
gray
rock
in
which
she
lay
she
in
that
dream
of
joy
dissolved
away
is
said
she
first
was
changed
into
a
vapour
and
then
into
a
cloud
such
clouds
as
flit
like
moths
about
a
taper
round
the
red
west
when
the
sun
dies
in
it
and
then
into
a
meteor
such
as
caper
on
when
the
moon
is
in
a
fit
then
into
one
of
those
mysterious
stars
which
hide
themselves
between
the
earth
and
mars
ten
times
the
mother
of
the
months
had
bent
her
bow
beside
the
and
bidden
with
that
bright
sign
the
billows
to
indent
the
sand
like
children
chidden
at
her
command
they
ever
came
and
went
since
in
that
cave
a
dewy
splendour
hidden
took
shape
and
motion
with
the
living
form
of
this
embodied
power
the
cave
grew
warm
a
lovely
lady
garmented
in
light
from
her
own
beauty
deep
her
eyes
as
are
two
openings
of
unfathomable
night
seen
through
a
temple
cloven
roof
her
hair
dark
the
dim
brain
whirls
dizzy
with
delight
picturing
her
form
her
soft
smiles
shone
afar
and
her
low
voice
was
heard
like
love
and
drew
all
living
things
towards
this
wonder
new
and
first
the
spotted
cameleopard
came
and
then
the
wise
and
fearless
elephant
then
the
sly
serpent
in
the
golden
flame
of
his
own
volumes
intervolved
all
gaunt
and
sanguine
beasts
her
gentle
looks
made
tame
they
drank
before
her
at
her
sacred
fount
and
every
beast
of
beating
heart
grew
bold
such
gentleness
and
power
even
to
behold
the
brinded
lioness
led
forth
her
young
that
she
might
teach
them
how
they
should
forego
their
inborn
thirst
of
death
the
pard
unstrung
his
sinews
at
her
feet
and
sought
to
know
with
looks
whose
motions
spoke
without
a
tongue
how
he
might
be
as
gentle
as
the
doe
the
magic
circle
of
her
voice
and
eyes
all
savage
natures
did
imparadise
and
old
silenus
shaking
a
green
stick
of
lilies
and
the
in
a
crew
came
blithe
as
in
the
olive
copses
thick
cicadae
are
drunk
with
the
noonday
dew
and
dryope
and
faunus
followed
quick
teasing
the
god
to
sing
them
something
new
till
in
this
cave
they
found
the
lady
lone
sitting
upon
a
seat
of
emerald
stone
and
universal
pan
is
said
was
there
and
though
none
saw
him
through
the
adamant
of
the
deep
mountains
through
the
trackless
air
and
through
those
living
spirits
like
a
want
he
passed
out
of
his
everlasting
lair
where
the
quick
heart
of
the
great
world
doth
pant
and
felt
that
wondrous
lady
all
alone
and
she
felt
him
upon
her
emerald
throne
and
every
nymph
of
stream
and
spreading
tree
and
every
shepherdess
of
ocean
flocks
who
drives
her
white
waves
over
the
green
sea
and
ocean
with
the
brine
on
his
gray
locks
and
quaint
priapus
with
his
company
all
came
much
wondering
how
the
enwombed
rocks
could
have
brought
forth
so
beautiful
a
birth
her
love
subdued
their
wonder
and
their
mirth
the
herdsmen
and
the
mountain
maidens
came
and
the
rude
kings
of
pastoral
garamant
their
spirits
shook
within
them
as
a
flame
stirred
by
the
air
under
a
cavern
gaunt
pigmies
and
polyphemes
by
many
a
name
centaurs
and
satyrs
and
such
shapes
as
haunt
wet
clefts
and
lumps
neither
alive
nor
dead
and
for
she
was
beautiful
her
beauty
made
the
bright
world
dim
and
everything
beside
seemed
like
the
fleeting
image
of
a
shade
no
thought
of
living
spirit
could
abide
which
to
her
looks
had
ever
been
betrayed
on
any
object
in
the
world
so
wide
on
any
hope
within
the
circling
skies
but
on
her
form
and
in
her
inmost
eyes
which
when
the
lady
knew
she
took
her
spindle
and
twined
three
threads
of
fleecy
mist
and
three
long
lines
of
light
such
as
the
dawn
may
kindle
the
clouds
and
waves
and
mountains
with
and
she
as
many
ere
their
lamps
could
dwindle
in
the
belated
moon
wound
skilfully
and
with
these
threads
a
subtle
veil
she
wove
a
shadow
for
the
splendour
of
her
love
the
deep
recesses
of
her
odorous
dwelling
were
stored
with
magic
treasures
sounds
of
air
which
had
the
power
all
spirits
of
compelling
folded
in
cells
of
crystal
silence
there
such
as
we
hear
in
youth
and
think
the
feeling
will
never
die
yet
ere
we
are
aware
the
feeling
and
the
sound
are
fled
and
gone
and
the
regret
they
leave
remains
alone
and
there
lay
visions
swift
and
sweet
and
quaint
each
in
its
thin
sheath
like
a
chrysalis
some
eager
to
burst
forth
some
weak
and
faint
with
the
soft
burthen
of
intensest
bliss
it
was
its
work
to
bear
to
many
a
saint
whose
heart
adores
the
shrine
which
holiest
is
even
love
and
others
white
green
gray
and
black
and
of
all
shapes
and
each
was
at
her
beck
and
odours
in
a
kind
of
aviary
of
she
kept
clipped
in
a
floating
net
a
fairy
had
woven
from
while
the
moon
yet
slept
as
bats
at
the
wired
window
of
a
dairy
they
beat
their
vans
and
each
was
an
adept
when
loosed
and
missioned
making
wings
of
winds
to
stir
sweet
thoughts
or
sad
in
destined
minds
and
liquors
clear
and
sweet
whose
healthful
might
could
medicine
the
sick
soul
to
happy
sleep
and
change
eternal
death
into
a
night
of
glorious
dreams
or
if
eyes
needs
must
weep
could
make
their
tears
all
wonder
and
delight
she
in
her
crystal
vials
did
closely
keep
if
men
could
drink
of
those
clear
vials
is
said
the
living
were
not
envied
of
the
dead
her
cave
was
stored
with
scrolls
of
strange
device
the
works
of
some
saturnian
archimage
which
taught
the
expiations
at
whose
price
men
from
the
gods
might
win
that
happy
age
too
lightly
lost
redeeming
native
vice
and
which
might
quench
the
rage
of
gold
and
blood
till
men
should
live
and
move
harmonious
as
the
sacred
stars
above
and
how
all
things
that
seem
untameable
not
to
be
checked
and
not
to
be
confined
obey
the
spells
of
wisdom
wizard
skill
time
earth
and
fire
the
ocean
and
the
wind
and
all
their
shapes
and
man
imperial
will
and
other
scrolls
whose
writings
did
unbind
the
inmost
lore
of
love
let
the
profane
tremble
to
ask
what
secrets
they
contain
and
wondrous
works
of
substances
unknown
to
which
the
enchantment
of
her
father
power
had
changed
those
ragged
blocks
of
savage
stone
were
heaped
in
the
recesses
of
her
bower
carved
lamps
and
chalices
and
vials
which
shone
in
their
own
golden
beams
each
like
a
flower
out
of
whose
depth
a
shakes
his
light
under
a
cypress
in
a
starless
night
at
first
she
lived
alone
in
this
wild
home
and
her
own
thoughts
were
each
a
minister
clothing
themselves
or
with
the
ocean
foam
or
with
the
wind
or
with
the
speed
of
fire
to
work
whatever
purposes
might
come
into
her
mind
such
power
her
mighty
sire
had
girt
them
with
whether
to
fly
or
run
through
all
the
regions
which
he
shines
upon
the
and
hamadryades
oreads
and
naiads
with
long
weedy
locks
offered
to
do
her
bidding
through
the
seas
under
the
earth
and
in
the
hollow
rocks
and
far
beneath
the
matted
roots
of
trees
and
in
the
gnarled
heart
of
stubborn
oaks
so
they
might
live
for
ever
in
the
light
of
her
sweet
presence
each
a
satellite
may
not
be
the
wizard
maid
replied
fountains
where
the
naiades
bedew
their
shining
hair
at
length
are
drained
and
dried
the
solid
oaks
forget
their
strength
and
strew
their
latest
leaf
upon
the
mountains
wide
the
boundless
ocean
like
a
drop
of
dew
will
be
consumed
the
stubborn
centre
must
be
scattered
like
a
cloud
of
summer
dust
ye
with
them
will
perish
one
by
one
if
i
must
sigh
to
think
that
this
shall
be
if
i
must
weep
when
the
surviving
sun
shall
smile
on
your
decay
oh
ask
not
me
to
love
you
till
your
little
race
is
run
i
can
not
die
as
ye
must
over
me
your
leaves
shall
glance
the

in
which
ye
dwell
shall
be
my
paths
henceforth
and
so
farewell
she
spoke
and
wept
the
dark
and
azure
well
sparkled
beneath
the
shower
of
her
bright
tears
and
every
little
circlet
where
they
fell
flung
to
the
inconstant
spheres
and
intertangled
lines
of
light
a
knell
of
sobbing
voices
came
upon
her
ears
from
those
departing
forms
the
serene
of
the
white
streams
and
of
the
forest
green
all
day
the
wizard
lady
sate
aloof
spelling
out
scrolls
of
dread
antiquity
under
the
cavern
roof
or
broidering
the
pictured
poesy
of
some
high
tale
upon
her
growing
woof
which
the
sweet
splendour
of
her
smiles
could
dye
in
hues
outshining
heaven
and
ever
she
added
some
grace
to
the
wrought
poesy
while
on
her
hearth
lay
blazing
many
a
piece
of
sandal
wood
rare
gums
and
cinnamon
men
scarcely
know
how
beautiful
fire
is
each
flame
of
it
is
as
a
precious
stone
dissolved
in
light
and
this
belongs
to
each
and
all
who
gaze
upon
the
witch
beheld
it
not
for
in
her
hand
she
held
a
woof
that
dimmed
the
burning
brand
this
lady
never
slept
but
lay
in
trance
all
night
within
the
fountain
as
in
sleep
its
emerald
crags
glowed
in
her
beauty
glance
through
the
green
splendour
of
the
water
deep
she
saw
the
constellations
reel
and
dance
like
and
withal
did
ever
keep
the
tenour
of
her
contemplations
calm
with
open
eyes
closed
feet
and
folded
palm
and
when
the
whirlwinds
and
the
clouds
descended
from
the
white
pinnacles
of
that
cold
hill
she
passed
at
dewfall
to
a
space
extended
where
in
a
lawn
of
flowering
asphodel
amid
a
wood
of
pines
and
cedars
blended
there
yawned
an
inextinguishable
well
of
crimson
fire
full
even
to
the
brim
and
overflowing
all
the
margin
trim
within
the
which
she
lay
when
the
fierce
war
of
wintry
winds
shook
that
innocuous
liquor
in
many
a
mimic
moon
and
bearded
star
woods
and
lawns
the
serpent
heard
it
flicker
in
sleep
and
dreaming
still
he
crept
afar
and
when
the
windless
snow
descended
thicker
than
autumn
leaves
she
watched
it
as
it
came
melt
on
the
surface
of
the
level
flame
she
had
a
boat
which
some
say
vulcan
wrought
for
venus
as
the
chariot
of
her
star
but
it
was
found
too
feeble
to
be
fraught
with
all
the
ardours
in
that
sphere
which
are
and
so
she
sold
it
and
apollo
bought
and
gave
it
to
this
daughter
from
a
car
changed
to
the
fairest
and
the
lightest
boat
which
ever
upon
mortal
stream
did
float
and
others
say
that
when
but
three
hours
old
the
love
out
of
his
cradle
lept
and
clove
dun
chaos
with
his
wings
of
gold
and
like
a
horticultural
adept
stole
a
strange
seed
and
wrapped
it
up
in
mould
and
sowed
it
in
his
mother
star
and
kept
watering
it
all
the
summer
with
sweet
dew
and
with
his
wings
fanning
it
as
it
grew
the
plant
grew
strong
and
green
the
snowy
flower
fell
and
the
long
and
fruit
began
to
turn
the
light
and
dew
by
inward
power
to
its
own
substance
woven
tracery
ran
of
light
firm
texture
ribbed
and
branching
the
solid
rind
like
a
leaf
veined
fan
of
which
love
scooped
this
boat
and
with
soft
motion
piloted
it
round
the
circumfluous
ocean
this
boat
she
moored
upon
her
fount
and
lit
a
living
spirit
within
all
its
frame
breathing
the
soul
of
swiftness
into
it
couched
on
the
fountain
like
a
panther
tame
one
of
the
twain
at
evan
feet
that
sit
or
as
on
vesta
sceptre
a
swift
flame
or
on
blind
homer
heart
a
winged
thought
in
joyous
expectation
lay
the
boat
then
by
strange
art
she
kneaded
fire
and
snow
together
tempering
the
repugnant
mass
with
liquid
love
all
things
together
grow
through
which
the
harmony
of
love
can
pass
and
a
fair
shape
out
of
her
hands
did
flow
a
living
image
which
did
far
surpass
in
beauty
that
bright
shape
of
vital
stone
which
drew
the
heart
out
of
pygmalion
a
sexless
thing
it
was
and
in
its
growth
it
seemed
to
have
developed
no
defect
of
either
sex
yet
all
the
grace
of
both
in
gentleness
and
strength
its
limbs
were
decked
the
bosom
swelled
lightly
with
its
full
youth
the
countenance
was
such
as
might
select
some
artist
that
his
skill
should
never
die
imaging
forth
such
perfect
purity
from
its
smooth
shoulders
hung
two
rapid
wings
fit
to
have
borne
it
to
the
seventh
sphere
tipped
with
the
speed
of
liquid
lightenings
dyed
in
the
ardours
of
the
atmosphere
she
led
her
creature
to
the
boiling
springs
where
the
light
boat
was
moored
and
said
here
and
pointed
to
the
prow
and
took
her
seat
beside
the
rudder
with
opposing
feet
and
down
the
streams
which
clove
those
mountains
vast
around
their
inland
islets
and
amid
the
forests
whose
shade
cast
darkness
and
odours
and
a
pleasure
hid
in
melancholy
gloom
the
pinnace
passed
by
many
a
pyramid
of
icy
crag
cleaving
the
purple
sky
and
caverns
yawning
round
unfathomably
the
silver
noon
into
that
winding
dell
with
slanted
gleam
athwart
the
forest
tops
tempered
like
golden
evening
feebly
fell
a
green
and
glowing
light
like
that
which
drops
from
folded
lilies
in
which
dwell
when
earth
over
her
face
night
mantle
wraps
between
the
severed
mountains
lay
on
high
over
the
stream
a
narrow
rift
of
sky
and
ever
as
she
went
the
image
lay
with
folded
wings
and
unawakened
eyes
and
its
gentle
countenance
did
play
the
busy
dreams
as
thick
as
summer
flies
chasing
the
rapid
smiles
that
would
not
stay
and
drinking
the
warm
tears
and
the
sweet
sighs
inhaling
which
with
busy
murmur
vain
they
had
aroused
from
that
full
heart
and
brain
and
ever
down
the
prone
vale
like
a
cloud
upon
a
stream
of
wind
the
pinnace
went
now
lingering
on
the
pools
in
which
abode
the
calm
and
darkness
of
the
deep
content
in
which
they
paused
now
the
shallow
road
of
white
and
dancing
waters
all
besprent
with
sand
and
polished
pebbles
mortal
boat
in
such
a
shallow
rapid
could
not
float
and
down
the
earthquaking
cataracts
which
shiver
their
waters
into
golden
air
or
under
chasms
unfathomable
ever
sepulchre
them
till
in
their
rage
they
tear
a
subterranean
portal
for
the
river
it
fled
the
circling
sunbows
did
upbear
its
fall
down
the
hoar
precipice
of
spray
lighting
it
far
upon
its
lampless
way
and
when
the
wizard
lady
would
ascend
the
labyrinths
of
some
vale
which
to
the
inmost
mountain
upward
tend
she
called
and
the
pale
and
heavy
hue
which
slumber
could
extend
over
its
lips
and
eyes
as
on
the
gale
a
rapid
shadow
from
a
slope
of
grass
into
the
darkness
of
the
stream
did
pass
and
it
unfurled
its
pinions
with
stars
of
fire
spotting
the
stream
below
and
from
above
into
the
sun
dominions
flinging
a
glory
like
the
golden
glow
in
which
spring
clothes
her
minions
all
interwoven
with
fine
feathery
snow
and
moonlight
splendour
of
intensest
rime
with
which
frost
paints
the
pines
in
winter
time
and
then
it
winnowed
the
elysian
air
which
ever
hung
about
that
lady
bright
with
its
aethereal
vans
and
speeding
there
like
a
star
up
the
torrent
of
the
night
or
a
swift
eagle
in
the
morning
glare
breasting
the
whirlwind
with
impetuous
flight
the
pinnace
oared
by
those
enchanted
wings
clove
the
fierce
streams
towards
their
upper
springs
the
water
flashed
like
sunlight
by
the
prow
of
a
meteor
flung
to
heaven
the
still
air
seemed
as
if
its
waves
did
flow
in
tempest
down
the
mountains
loosely
driven
the
lady
radiant
hair
streamed
to
and
fro
beneath
the
billows
having
vainly
striven
indignant
and
impetuous
roared
to
feel
the
swift
and
steady
motion
of
the
keel
or
when
the
weary
moon
was
in
the
wane
or
in
the
noon
of
interlunar
night
the
in
visions
could
not
chain
her
spirit
but
sailed
forth
under
the
light
of
shooting
stars
and
bade
extend
amain
its
wings
the
hermaphrodite
she
to
the
austral
waters
took
her
way
beyond
the
fabulous
thamondocana
where
like
a
meadow
which
no
scythe
has
shaven
which
rain
could
never
bend
or
shake
with
the
antarctic
constellations
paven
canopus
and
his
crew
lay
the
austral
lake
there
she
would
build
herself
a
windless
haven
out
of
the
clouds
whose
moving
turrets
make
the
bastions
of
the
storm
when
through
the
sky
the
spirits
of
the
tempest
thundered
by
a
haven
beneath
whose
translucent
floor
the
tremulous
stars
sparkled
unfathomably
and
around
which
the
solid
vapours
hoar
based
on
the
level
waters
to
the
sky
lifted
their
dreadful
crags
and
like
a
shore
of
wintry
mountains
inaccessibly
hemmed
in
with
rifts
and
precipices
gray
and
hanging
crags
many
a
cove
and
bay
and
whilst
the
outer
lake
beneath
the
lash
of
the
wind
scourge
foamed
like
a
wounded
thing
and
the
incessant
hail
with
stony
clash
ploughed
up
the
waters
and
the
flagging
wing
of
the
roused
cormorant
in
the
lightning
flash
looked
like
the
wreck
of
some
fragment
of
inky
this
haven
was
as
a
gem
to
copy
heaven
engraven
on
which
that
lady
played
her
many
pranks
circling
the
image
of
a
shooting
star
even
as
a
tiger
on
hydaspes
banks
outspeeds
the
antelopes
which
speediest
are
in
her
light
boat
and
many
quips
and
cranks
she
played
upon
the
water
till
the
car
of
the
late
moon
like
a
sick
matron
wan
to
journey
from
the
misty
east
began
and
then
she
called
out
of
the
hollow
turrets
of
those
high
clouds
white
golden
and
vermilion
the
armies
of
her
ministering
spirits
in
mighty
legions
million
after
million
they
came
each
troop
emblazoning
its
merits
on
meteor
flags
and
many
a
proud
pavilion
of
the
intertexture
of
the
atmosphere
they
pitched
upon
the
plain
of
the
calm
mere
they
framed
the
imperial
tent
of
their
great
queen
of
woven
exhalations
underlaid
with
lambent
as
may
be
seen
a
dome
of
thin
and
open
ivory
inlaid
with
crimson
silk
cressets
from
the
serene
hung
there
and
on
the
water
for
her
tread
a
tapestry
of
mist
was
strewn
dyed
in
the
beams
of
the
ascending
moon
and
on
a
throne
with
starlight
caught
upon
those
wandering
isles
of
aery
dew
which
highest
shoals
of
mountain
shipwreck
not
she
sate
and
heard
all
that
had
happened
new
between
the
earth
and
moon
since
they
had
brought
the
last
intelligence
and
now
she
grew
pale
as
that
moon
lost
in
the
watery
night
and
now
she
wept
and
now
she
laughed
outright
these
were
tame
pleasures
she
would
often
climb
the
steepest
ladder
of
the
crudded
rack
up
to
some
beaked
cape
of
cloud
sublime
and
like
arion
on
the
dolphin
back
ride
singing
through
the
shoreless
air
following
the
serpent
lightning
winding
track
she
ran
upon
the
platforms
of
the
wind
and
laughed
to
bear
the
roar
behind
and
sometimes
to
those
streams
of
upper
air
which
whirl
the
earth
in
its
diurnal
round
she
would
ascend
and
win
the
spirits
there
to
let
her
join
their
chorus
mortals
found
that
on
those
days
the
sky
was
calm
and
fair
and
mystic
snatches
of
harmonious
sound
wandered
upon
the
earth
she
passed
and
happy
thoughts
of
hope
too
sweet
to
last
but
her
choice
sport
was
in
the
hours
of
sleep
to
glide
adown
old
nilus
where
he
threads
egypt
and
aethiopia
from
the
steep
of
utmost
axume
until
he
spreads
like
a
calm
flock
of
sheep
his
waters
on
the
plain
and
crested
heads
of
cities
and
proud
temples
gleam
amid
and
many
a
pyramid
by
moeris
and
the
mareotid
lakes
strewn
with
faint
blooms
like
bridal
chamber
floors
where
naked
boys
bridling
tame
or
charioteering
ghastly
alligators
had
left
on
the
sweet
waters
mighty
wakes
of
those
huge
forms
within
the
brazen
doors
of
the
great
labyrinth
slept
both
boy
and
beast
tired
with
the
pomp
of
their
osirian
feast
and
where
within
the
surface
of
the
river
the
shadows
of
the
massy
temples
lie
and
never
are
erased
but
tremble
ever
like
things
which
every
cloud
can
doom
to
die
through
canals
and
wheresoever
the
works
of
man
pierced
that
serenest
sky
with
tombs
and
towers
and
fanes
was
her
delight
to
wander
in
the
shadow
of
the
night
with
motion
like
the
spirit
of
that
wind
whose
soft
step
deepens
slumber
her
light
feet
passed
through
the
peopled
haunts
of
humankind
scattering
sweet
visions
from
her
presence
sweet
through
fane
and
and
labyrinth
mined
with
many
a
dark
and
subterranean
street
under
the
nile
through
chambers
high
and
deep
she
passed
observing
mortals
in
their
sleep
a
pleasure
sweet
doubtless
it
was
to
see
mortals
subdued
in
all
the
shapes
of
sleep
here
lay
two
sister
twins
in
infancy
there
a
lone
youth
who
in
his
dreams
did
weep
within
two
lovers
linked
innocently
in
their
loose
locks
which
over
both
did
creep
like
ivy
from
one
stem
and
there
lay
calm
old
age
with
hair
and
folded
palm
but
other
troubled
forms
of
sleep
she
saw
not
to
be
mirrored
in
a
holy
song
distortions
foul
of
supernatural
awe
and
pale
imaginings
of
visioned
wrong
and
all
the
code
of
custom
lawless
law
written
upon
the
brows
of
old
and
young
said
the
wizard
maiden
the
strife
which
stirs
the
liquid
surface
of
man
life
and
little
did
the
sight
disturb
her
we
the
weak
mariners
of
that
wide
lake
its
shores
extend
or
billows
roll
our
course
unpiloted
and
starless
make
its
wild
surface
to
an
unknown
goal
but
she
in
the
calm
depths
her
way
could
take
where
in
bright
bowers
immortal
forms
abide
beneath
the
weltering
of
the
restless
tide
and
she
saw
princes
couched
under
the
glow
of
sunlike
gems
and
round
each
in
dormitories
ranged
row
after
row
she
saw
the
priests
asleep
all
of
one
sort
for
all
were
educated
to
be
the
peasants
in
their
huts
and
in
the
port
the
sailors
she
saw
cradled
on
the
waves
and
the
dead
lulled
within
their
dreamless
graves
and
all
the
forms
in
which
those
spirits
lay
were
to
her
sight
like
the
diaphanous
veils
in
which
those
sweet
ladies
oft
array
their
delicate
limbs
who
would
conceal
from
us
only
their
scorn
of
all
concealment
they
move
in
the
light
of
their
own
beauty
thus
but
these
and
all
now
lay
with
sleep
upon
them
and
little
thought
a
witch
was
looking
on
them
she
all
those
human
figures
breathing
there
beheld
as
living
spirits
to
her
eyes
the
naked
beauty
of
the
soul
lay
bare
and
often
through
a
rude
and
worn
disguise
she
saw
the
inner
form
most
bright
and
fair
and
then
she
had
a
charm
of
strange
device
which
murmured
on
mute
lips
with
tender
tone
could
make
that
spirit
mingle
with
her
own
alas
aurora
what
wouldst
thou
have
given
for
such
a
charm
when
tithon
became
gray
or
how
much
venus
of
thy
silver
heaven
wouldst
thou
have
yielded
ere
proserpina
had
half
oh
why
not
all
the
debt
forgiven
which
dear
adonis
had
been
doomed
to
pay
to
any
witch
who
would
have
taught
you
it
the
heliad
doth
not
know
its
value
yet
is
said
in
after
times
her
spirit
free
knew
what
love
was
and
felt
itself
alone
but
holy
dian
could
not
chaster
be
before
she
stooped
to
kiss
endymion
than
now
this
lady
like
a
sexless
bee
tasting
all
blossoms
and
confined
to
none
among
those
mortal
forms
the
passed
with
an
eye
serene
and
heart
unladen
to
those
she
saw
most
beautiful
she
gave
strange
panacea
in
a
crystal
bowl
they
drank
in
their
deep
sleep
of
that
sweet
wave
and
lived
thenceforward
as
if
some
control
mightier
than
life
were
in
them
and
the
grave
of
such
when
death
oppressed
the
weary
soul
was
as
a
green
and
overarching
bower
lit
by
the
gems
of
many
a
starry
flower
for
on
the
night
when
they
were
buried
she
restored
the
embalmers
ruining
and
shook
the
light
out
of
the
funeral
lamps
to
be
a
mimic
day
within
that
deathy
nook
and
she
unwound
the
woven
imagery
of
second
childhood
swaddling
bands
and
took
the
coffin
its
last
cradle
from
its
niche
and
threw
it
with
contempt
into
a
ditch
and
there
the
body
lay
age
after
age
mute
breathing
beating
warm
and
undecaying
like
one
asleep
in
a
green
hermitage
with
gentle
smiles
about
its
eyelids
playing
and
living
in
its
dreams
beyond
the
rage
of
death
or
life
while
they
were
still
arraying
in
liveries
ever
new
the
rapid
blind
and
fleeting
generations
of
mankind
and
she
would
write
strange
dreams
upon
the
brain
of
those
who
were
less
beautiful
and
make
all
harsh
and
crooked
purposes
more
vain
than
in
the
desert
is
the
serpent
wake
which
the
sand
covers
all
his
evil
gain
the
miser
in
such
dreams
would
rise
and
shake
into
a
beggar
lap
the
lying
scribe
would
his
own
lies
betray
without
a
bribe
the
priests
would
write
an
explanation
full
translating
hieroglyphics
into
greek
how
the
god
apis
really
was
a
bull
and
nothing
more
and
bid
the
herald
stick
the
same
against
the
temple
doors
and
pull
the
old
cant
down
they
licensed
all
to
speak
they
thought
of
hawks
and
cats
and
geese
by
pastoral
letters
to
each
diocese
the
king
would
dress
an
ape
up
in
his
crown
and
robes
and
seat
him
on
his
glorious
seat
and
on
the
right
hand
of
the
sunlike
throne
would
place
a
gaudy
to
repeat
the
chatterings
of
the
every
one
of
the
prone
courtiers
crawled
to
kiss
the
feet
of
their
great
emperor
when
the
morning
came
and
kissed
alas
how
many
kiss
the
same
the
soldiers
dreamed
that
they
were
blacksmiths
and
walked
out
of
quarters
in
somnambulism
round
the
red
anvils
you
might
see
them
stand
like
cyclopses
in
vulcan
sooty
abysm
beating
their
swords
to
ploughshares
in
a
band
the
gaolers
sent
those
of
the
liberal
schism
free
through
the
streets
of
memphis
much
i
wis
to
the
annoyance
of
king
amasis
and
timid
lovers
who
had
been
so
coy
they
hardly
knew
whether
they
loved
or
not
would
rise
out
of
their
rest
and
take
sweet
joy
to
the
fulfilment
of
their
inmost
thought
and
when
next
day
the
maiden
and
the
boy
met
one
another
both
like
sinners
caught
blushed
at
the
thing
which
each
believed
was
done
only
in
fancy
till
the
tenth
moon
shone
and
then
the
witch
would
let
them
take
no
ill
of
many
thousand
schemes
which
lovers
find
the
witch
found
one
and
so
they
took
their
fill
of
happiness
in
marriage
warm
and
kind
friends
who
by
practice
of
some
envious
skill
were
torn
apart
a
wide
wound
mind
from
mind
she
did
unite
again
with
visions
clear
of
deep
affection

of

these
were

she
played
among

cities
of

note
on
the
witch
of
atlas
by
shelley
we
spent
the
summer
of
at
the
baths
of
san
giuliano
four
miles
from
pisa
these
baths
were
of
great
use
to
shelley
in
soothing
his
nervous
irritability
we
made
several
excursions
in
the
neighbourhood
the
country
around
is
fertile
and
diversified
and
rendered
picturesque
by
ranges
of
near
hills
and
more
distant
mountains
the
peasantry
are
a
handsome
intelligent
race
and
there
was
a
gladsome
sunny
heaven
spread
over
us
that
rendered
home
and
every
scene
we
visited
cheerful
and
bright
during
some
of
the
hottest
days
of
august
shelley
made
a
solitary
journey
on
foot
to
the
summit
of
monte
san
pellegrino
a
mountain
of
some
height
on
the
top
of
which
there
is
a
chapel
the
object
during
certain
days
of
the
year
of
many
pilgrimages
the
excursion
delighted
him
while
it
lasted
though
he
exerted
himself
too
much
and
the
effect
was
considerable
lassitude
and
weakness
on
his
return
during
the
expedition
he
conceived
the
idea
and
wrote
in
the
three
days
immediately
succeeding
to
his
return
the
witch
of
atlas
this
poem
is
peculiarly
characteristic
of
his
tastes
wildly
fanciful
full
of
brilliant
imagery
and
discarding
human
interest
and
passion
to
revel
in
the
fantastic
ideas
that
his
imagination
suggested
the
surpassing
excellence
of
the
cenci
had
made
me
greatly
desire
that
shelley
should
increase
his
popularity
by
adopting
subjects
that
would
more
suit
the
popular
taste
than
a
poem
conceived
in
the
abstract
and
dreamy
spirit
of
the
witch
of
atlas
it
was
not
only
that
i
wished
him
to
acquire
popularity
as
redounding
to
his
fame
but
i
believed
that
he
would
obtain
a
greater
mastery
over
his
own
powers
and
greater
happiness
in
his
mind
if
public
applause
crowned
his
endeavours
the
few
stanzas
that
precede
the
poem
were
addressed
to
me
on
my
representing
these
ideas
to
him
even
now
i
believe
that
i
was
in
the
right
shelley
did
not
expect
sympathy
and
approbation
from
the
public
but
the
want
of
it
took
away
a
portion
of
the
ardour
that
ought
to
have
sustained
him
while
writing
he
was
thrown
on
his
own
resources
and
on
the
inspiration
of
his
own
soul
and
wrote
because
his
mind
overflowed
without
the
hope
of
being
appreciated
i
had
not
the
most
distant
wish
that
he
should
truckle
in
opinion
or
submit
his
lofty
aspirations
for
the
human
race
to
the
low
ambition
and
pride
of
the
many
but
i
felt
sure
that
if
his
poems
were
more
addressed
to
the
common
feelings
of
men
his
proper
rank
among
the
writers
of
the
day
would
be
acknowledged
and
that
popularity
as
a
poet
would
enable
his
countrymen
to
do
justice
to
his
character
and
virtues
which
in
those
days
it
was
the
mode
to
attack
with
the
most
flagitious
calumnies
and
insulting
abuse
that
he
felt
these
things
deeply
can
not
be
doubted
though
he
armed
himself
with
the
consciousness
of
acting
from
a
lofty
and
heroic
sense
of
right
the
truth
burst
from
his
heart
sometimes
in
solitude
and
he
would
writes
few
unfinished
verses
that
showed
that
he
felt
the
sting
among
such
i
find
the
following
this
is
not
what
i
thought
life
was
i
knew
that
there
were
crimes
and
evil
men
misery
and
hate
nor
did
i
hope
to
pass
untouched
by
suffering
through
the
rugged
glen
in
mine
own
heart
i
saw
as
in
a
glass
the
hearts
of
others
and
when
i
went
among
my
kind
with
triple
brass
of
calm
endurance
my
weak
breast
i
armed
to
bear
scorn
fear
and
hate
a
woful
mass
i
believed
that
all
this
morbid
feeling
would
vanish
if
the
chord
of
sympathy
between
him
and
his
countrymen
were
touched
but
my
persuasions
were
vain
the
mind
could
not
be
bent
from
its
natural
inclination
shelley
shrunk
instinctively
from
portraying
human
passion
with
its
mixture
of
good
and
evil
of
disappointment
and
disquiet
such
opened
again
the
wounds
of
his
own
heart
and
he
loved
to
shelter
himself
rather
in
the
airiest
flights
of
fancy
forgetting
love
and
hate
and
regret
and
lost
hope
in
such
imaginations
as
borrowed
their
hues
from
sunrise
or
sunset
from
the
yellow
moonshine
or
paly
twilight
from
the
aspect
of
the
far
ocean
or
the
shadows
of
the
woods
which
celebrated
the
singing
of
the
winds
among
the
pines
the
flow
of
a
murmuring
stream
and
the
thousand
harmonious
sounds
which
nature
creates
in
her
solitudes
these
are
the
materials
which
form
the
witch
of
atlas
it
is
a
brilliant
congregation
of
ideas
such
as
his
senses
gathered
and
his
fancy
coloured
during
his
rambles
in
the
sunny
land
he
so
much
loved

this
tragedy
is
one
of
a
triad
or
system
of
three
plays
an
arrangement
according
to
which
the
greeks
were
accustomed
to
connect
their
dramatic
representations
elucidating
the
wonderful
and
appalling
fortunes
of
the
swellfoot
dynasty
it
was
evidently
written
by
some
learned
theban
and
from
its
characteristic
dulness
apparently
before
the
duties
on
the
importation
of
attic
salt
had
been
repealed
by
the
boeotarchs
the
tenderness
with
which
he
treats
the
pigs
proves
him
to
have
been
a
sus

possibly

as
the
poet
observes

makes

no
liberty
has
been
taken
with
the
translation
of
this
remarkable
piece
of

and
blasphemous
chorus
of
the
pigs
and
bulls
at
the
last
act
the
work
hoydipouse
or
more
properly
oedipus
has
been
rendered
literally
swellfoot
without
its

necessary

determine
whether
a
swelling
of
the
hind
or

how
the

cry
iona
taurina
i
suffer
the

presence
purganax
off
with

i
must
first
impanel
a
jury
of
the
pigs
swellfoot
pack
them
then
purganax
or
fattening
some
few
in
two
separate
sties
and
giving

clean
straw
tying
some
bits
of
ribbon
round
their

giving

some
tawdry
lace
and
bits
of
lustre
glass

their
young
boars
white
and
red
rags
and
tails
of
cows
and
jay
feathers
and
sticking
cauliflowers
between
the
ears
of
the
old
ones
and
when
they
are
persuaded
that
by
the
inherent
virtue
of
these
things
they
are
all
imperial
pigs
good
lord
they
rip
each
other
bellies
up
not
to
say
help
us
in
destroying
her
swellfoot
this
plan
might
be
tried
too
where
general
laoctonos
enter
laoctonos
and
dakry
it
is
my
royal
pleasure
that
you
lord
general
bring
the
head
and
body
if
separate
it
would
please
me
better
hither
of
queen
iona
laoctonos
that
pleasure
i
well
knew

made
a
charge
with
those
battalions
bold
called
from
their
dress
and
grin
the
royal
apes
upon
the
swine
who
in
a
hollow
square
enclosed
her
and
received
the
first
attack
like
so
many
rhinoceroses
and
then
retreating
in
good
order
with
bare
tusks
and
wrinkled
snouts
presented
to
the
foe
bore
her
in
triumph
to
the
public
sty
what
is
still
worse
some
sows
upon
the
ground
have
given
the
apples
nuts
and
gin
and
they
all
whisk
their
tails
aloft
and
cry
live
iona
down
with
swellfoot
purganax
hark
the
swine
without
long
live
iona
down
with
swellfoot
dakry
i
went
to
the
garret
of
the
swineherd
tower
which
overlooks
the
sty
and
made
a
long
harangue
all
words
to
the
assembled
swine
of
delicacy
mercy
judgement
law
morals
and
precedents
and
purity
adultery
destitution
and
divorce
piety
faith
and
state
necessity
and
how
i
loved
the
queen
and
then
i
wept
with
the
pathos
of
my
own
eloquence
and
every
tear
turned
to
a
which
brained
many
a
gaping
pig
and
there
was
made
a
slough
of
blood
and
brains
upon
the
place
greased
with
the
pounded
bacon
round
and
round
the
rolled
ploughing
the
pavement
up
and
hurling
into
the
air
with
dust
and
enter
mammon
mammon
i
wonder
that
gray
wizards
like
you
should
be
so
beardless
in
their
schemes
it
had
been
but
a
point
of
policy
to
keep
iona
and
the
swine
apart
divide
and
rule
but
ye
have
made
a
junction
between
two
parties
who
will
govern
you
but
for
my
behold
this
bag
it
is
the
poison
bag
of
that
green
spider
huge
on
which
our
spies
skulked
in
ovation
through
the
streets
of
thebes
when
they
were
paved
with
dead
a
bane
so
much
the
deadlier
fills
it
now
as
calumny
is
worse
than
death
for
here
the
gadfly
venom
fifty
times
distilled
is
mingled
with
the
vomit
of
the
leech
in
due
proportion
and
black
ratsbane
which
that
very
rat
who
like
the
pontic
tyrant
nurtures
himself
on
poison
dare
not
touch
all
is
sealed
up
with
the
broad
seal
of
fraud
who
is
the
devil
lord
high
chancellor
and
over
it
the
primate
of
all
hell
murmured
this
pious
baptism
thou
called
the
green
bag
and
this
power
and
grace
be
thine
that
thy
contents
on
whomsoever
poured
turn
innocence
to
guilt

gentlest
looks

savage
foul
and
fierce
deformity

be
they

than
their
own
the

sin
on
this
side
of
the

wither
they
to
a
ghastly
caricature
of
what
was
human
let
not

behold
their
face
with
unaverted
eyes
or
hear
their
names
with
ears
that
tingle
not
with

this
is
a
perilous
liquor

my

only
undoing
all
that
has
been
done
yet
so
as
it
may
seem
we
but
confirm
it
our
victory
is
assured
we
must
entice
her
majesty
from
the
sty
and
make
the
pigs
believe
that
the
contents
of
the
green
bag
are
the
true
test
of
guilt
or
innocence
and
that
if
she
be
guilty
transform
her
to
manifest
deformity
like
guilt
if
innocent
she
will
become
transfigured
into
an
angel
such
as
they
say
she
is
and
they
will
see
her
flying
through
the
air
so
bright
that
she
will
dim
the
noonday
sun
showering
down
blessings
in
the
shape
of

climbing

low
sties
with
pieces
of
smoked
glass
to
watch
her
sail
among

and
some
will
hold
the
flaps
of
one
another

between
their
teeth
to
catch
the
coming
hail
of
comfits
in
you
purganax
who
have
the

make

a
solemn

is
you

by

the

which
i

what
does
any

accuse
her
of

why
no

makes
any
positive
accusation
but
there
were
hints
dropped

so
the
privy

conceived
that
it
became
them
to
advise
his

to
investigate
their

not
for

he
could
be
content
to
let
his

play
any
pranks
she
pleased
if
by
that
sufferance
he
could
please
the

then
he
fears
the

note

by

brief
journal
i
kept
in
those
days
i
find
recorded
in
august
shelley
swellfoot
the
tyrant
suggested
by
the
pigs
at
the
fair
of
san
giuliano
this
was
the
period
of
queen
landing
in
england
and
the
struggles
made
by
george
iv
to
get
rid
of
her
claims
which
failing
lord
castlereagh
placed
the
green
bag
on
the
table
of
the
house
of
commons
demanding
in
the
king
name
that
an
enquiry
should
be
instituted
into
his
wife
conduct
these
circumstances
were
the
theme
of
all
conversation
among
the
english
we
were
then
at
the
baths
of
san
giuliano
a
friend
came
to
visit
us
on
the
day
when
a
fair
was
held
in
the
square
beneath
our
windows
shelley
read
to
us
his
ode
to
liberty
and
was
riotously
accompanied
by
the
grunting
of
a
quantity
of
pigs
brought
for
sale
to
the
fair
he
compared
it
to
the
of
frogs
in
the
satiric
drama
of
aristophanes
and
it
being
an
hour
of
merriment
and
one
ludicrous
association
suggesting
another
he
imagined
a
drama
on
the
circumstances
of
the
day
to
which
the
pigs
would
serve
as
chorus
and
swellfoot
was
begun
when
finished
it
was
transmitted
to
england
printed
and
published
anonymously
but
stifled
at
the
very
dawn
of
its
existence
by
the
society
for
the
suppression
of
vice
who
threatened
to
prosecute
it
if
not
immediately
withdrawn
the
friend
who
had
taken
the
trouble
of
bringing
it
out
of
course
did
not
think
it
worth
the
annoyance
and
expense
of
a
contest
and
it
was
laid
aside
hesitation
of
whether
it
would
do
honour
to
shelley
prevented
my
publishing
it
at
first
but
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
keep
back
anything
he
ever
wrote
for
each
word
is
fraught
with
the
peculiar
views
and
sentiments
which
he
believed
to
be
beneficial
to
the
human
race
and
the
bright
light
of
poetry
irradiates
every
thought
the
world
has
a
right
to
the
entire
compositions
of
such
a
man
for
it
does
not
live
and
thrive
by
the
outworn
lesson
of
the
dullard
or
the
hypocrite
but
by
the
original
free
thoughts
of
men
of
genius
who
aspire
to
pluck
bright
truth
the
moon
or
dive
into
the
bottom
of
the
deep
where
would
never
touch
the
ground
and
pluck
up
truth
even
those
who
may
dissent
from
his
opinions
will
consider
that
he
was
a
man
of
genius
and
that
the
world
will
take
more
interest
in
his
slightest
word
than
in
the
waters
of
lethe
which
are
so
eagerly
prescribed
as
medicinal
for
all
its
wrongs
and
woe
this
drama
however
must
not
be
judged
for
more
than
was
meant
it
is
a
mere
plaything
of
the
imagination
which
even
may
not
excite
smiles
among
many
who
will
not
see
wit
in
those
combinations
of
thought
which
were
full
of
the
ridiculous
to
the
author
but
like
everything
he
wrote
it
breathes
that
deep
sympathy
for
the
sorrows
of
humanity
and
indignation
against
its
oppressors
which
make
it
worthy
of
his
name

in

our
text
follows
that
of
the
editio
princeps
advertisement
the
writer
of
the
following
lines
died
at
florence
as
he
was
preparing
for
a
voyage
to
one
of
the
wildest
of
the
sporades
which
he
had
bought
and
where
he
had
fitted
up
the
ruins
of
an
old
building
and
where
it
was
his
hope
to
have
realised
a
scheme
of
life
suited
perhaps
to
that
happier
and
better
world
of
which
he
is
now
an
inhabitant
but
hardly
practicable
in
this
his
life
was
singular
less
on
account
of
the
romantic
vicissitudes
which
diversified
it
than
the
ideal
tinge
which
it
received
from
his
own
character
and
feelings
the
present
poem
like
the
vita
nuova
of
dante
is
sufficiently
intelligible
to
a
certain
class
of
readers
without
a
history
of
the
circumstances
to
which
it
relates
and
to
a
certain
other
class
it
must
ever
remain
incomprehensible
from
a
defect
of
a
common
organ
of
perception
for
the
ideas
of
which
it
treats
not
but
that
gran
vergogna
sarebbe
a
colui
che
rimasse
cosa
sotto
veste
di
figura
o
di
colore
rettorico
e
domandato
non
sapesse
denudare
le
sue
parole
da
cotal
veste
in
guisa
che
avessero
verace
intendimento
the
present
poem
appears
to
have
been
intended
by
the
writer
as
the
dedication
to
some
longer
one
the
stanza
on
the
opposite
page
is
almost
a
literal
translation
from
dante
famous
canzone
voi
ch
intendendo
il
terzo
ciel
movete
etc
the
presumptuous
application
of
the
concluding
lines
to
his
own
composition
will
raise
a
smile
at
the
expense
of
my
unfortunate
friend
be
it
a
smile
not
of
contempt
but
pity
the
nine
lines
which
follow
beginning

i
fear
ed
my
song
i
fear
that
thou
wilt
find
but
few
who
fitly
shalt
conceive
thy
reasoning
of
such
hard
matter
dost
thou
entertain
whence
if
by
misadventure
chance
should
bring
thee
to
base
company
as
chance
may
do
quite
unaware
of
what
thou
dost
contain
i
prithee
comfort

sweet
self

them
that
they

them
own

thou

orphan

whose
empire
is
the

thou
weepest
on

i
suspend
to
thee
these
votive
wreaths
of
withered
memory
poor
captive
bird
who
from
thy
narrow
cage
pourest
such
music
that
it
might
assuage
the
rugged
hearts
of
those
who
prisoned
thee
were
they
not
deaf
to
all
sweet
melody
this
song
shall
be
thy
rose
its
petals
pale
are
dead
indeed
my
adored
nightingale
but
soft
and
fragrant
is
the
faded
blossom
and
it
has
no
thorn
left
to
wound
thy
bosom
high
heart
who
dost
for
ever
beat
thine
unfeeling
bars
with
vain
endeavour
till
those
bright
plumes
of
thought
in
which
arrayed
it
this
low
and
worldly
shade
lie
shattered
and
thy
panting
wounded
breast
stains
with
dear
blood
its
unmaternal
nest
i
weep
vain
tears
blood
would
less
bitter
be
yet
poured
forth
gladlier
could
it
profit
thee
seraph
of
heaven
too
gentle
to
be
human
veiling
beneath
that
radiant
form
of
woman
all
that
is
insupportable
in
thee
of
light
and
love
and
immortality
sweet
benediction
in
the
eternal
curse
veiled
glory
of
this
lampless
universe
thou
moon
beyond
the
clouds
thou
living
form
among
the
dead
thou
star
above
the
storm
thou
wonder
and
thou
beauty
and
thou
terror
thou
harmony
of
nature
art
thou
mirror
in
whom
as
in
the
splendour
of
the
sun
all
shapes
look
glorious
which
thou
gazest
on
ay
even
the
dim
words
which
obscure
thee
now
flash
with
unaccustomed
glow
i
pray
thee
that
thou
blot
from
this
sad
song
all
of
its
much
mortality
and
wrong
with
those
clear
drops
which
start
like
sacred
dew
from
the
twin
lights
thy
sweet
soul
darkens
through
weeping
till
sorrow
becomes
ecstasy
then
smile
on
it
so
that
it
may
not
die
i
never
thought
before
my
death
to
see

thus
made
perfect
emily
i
love
thee
though
the
world
by
no
thin
name
will
hide
that
love
from
its
unvalued
shame
would
we
two
had
been
twins
of
the
same
mother
or
that
the
name
my
heart
lent
to
another
could
be
a
sister
bond
for
her
and
thee
blending
two
beams
of
one
eternity
yet
were
one
lawful
and
the
other
true
these
names
though
dear
could
paint
not
as
is
due
how
beyond
refuge
i
am
thine
ah
me
i
am
not
thine
i
am
a
part
of
thee
sweet
lamp
my
muse
has
burned
its
wings
or
like
a
dying
swan
who
soars
and
sings
young
love
should
teach
time
in
his
own
gray
style
all
that
thou
art
art
thou
not
void
of
guile
a
lovely
soul
formed
to
be
blessed
and
bless
a
well
of
sealed
and
secret
happiness
whose
waters
like
blithe
light
and
music
are
vanquishing
dissonance
and
gloom
a
star
which
moves
not
in
the
moving
heavens
alone
a
smile
amid
dark
frowns
a
gentle
tone
amid
rude
voices
a
beloved
light
a
solitude
a
refuge
a
delight
a
lute
which
those
whom
love
has
taught
to
play
make
music
on
to
soothe
the
roughest
day
and
lull
fond
grief
asleep
a
buried
treasure
a
cradle
of
young
thoughts
of
wingless
pleasure
a
grave
of
woe
i
measure
the
world
of
fancies
seeking
one
like
thee
and
find
alas
mine
own
infirmity
she
met
me
stranger
upon
life
rough
way
and
lured
me
towards
sweet
death
as
night
by
day
winter
by
spring
or
sorrow
by
swift
hope
led
into
light
life
peace
an
antelope
in
the
suspended
impulse
of
its
lightness
were
less
aethereally
light
the
brightness
of
her
divinest
presence
trembles
through
her
limbs
as
underneath
a
cloud
of
dew
embodied
in
the
windless
heaven
of
june
amid
the
stars
the
moon
burns
inextinguishably
beautiful
and
from
her
lips
as
from
a
hyacinth
full
of
a
liquid
murmur
drops
killing
the
sense
with
passion
sweet
as
stops
of
planetary
music
heard
in
trance
in
her
mild
lights
the
starry
spirits
dance
the
sunbeams
of
those
wells
which
ever
leap
under
the
lightnings
of
the
soul
too
deep
for
the
brief
of
thought
or
sense
the
glory
of
her
being
issuing
thence
stains
the
dead
blank
cold
air
with
a
warm
shade
of
unentangled
intermixture
made
by
love
of
light
and
motion
one
intense
diffusion
one
serene
omnipresence
whose
flowing
outlines
mingle
in
their
flowing
around
her
cheeks
and
utmost
fingers
glowing
with
the
unintermitted
blood
which
there
quivers
as
in
a
fleece
of
air
the
crimson
pulse
of
living
morning
quiver
continuously
prolonged
and
ending
never
till
they
are
lost
and
in
that
beauty
furled
which
penetrates
and
clasps
and
fills
the
world
scarce
visible
from
extreme
loveliness
warm
fragrance
seems
to
fall
from
her
light
dress
and
her
loose
hair
and
where
some
heavy
tress
the
air
of
her
own
speed
has
disentwined
the
sweetness
seems
to
satiate
the
faint
wind
and
in
the
soul
a
wild
odour
is
felt
beyond
the
sense
like
fiery
dews
that
melt
into
the
bosom
of
a
frozen
see
where
she
stands
a
mortal
shape
indued
with
love
and
life
and
light
and
deity
and
motion
which
may
change
but
can
not
die
an
image
of
some
bright
eternity
a
shadow
of
some
golden
dream
a
splendour
leaving
the
third
sphere
pilotless
a
tender
reflection
of
the
eternal
moon
of
love
under
whose
motions
life
dull
billows
move
a
metaphor
of
spring
and
youth
and
morning
a
vision
like
incarnate
april
warning
with
smiles
and
tears
frost
the
anatomy
into
his
summer
grave
ah
woe
is
me
what
have
i
dared
where
am
i
lifted
how
shall
i
descend
and
perish
not
i
know
that
love
makes
all
things
equal
i
have
heard
by
mine
own
heart
this
joyous
truth
averred
the
spirit
of
the
worm
beneath
the
sod
in
love
and
worship
blends
itself
with
god
spouse
sister
angel
pilot
of
the
fate
whose
course
has
been
so
starless
o
too
late
beloved
o
too
soon
adored
by
me
for
in
the
fields
of
immortality
my
spirit
should
at
first
have
worshipped
thine
a
divine
presence
in
a
place
divine
or
should
have
moved
beside
it
on
this
earth
a
shadow
of
that
substance
from
its
birth
but
not
as
now
i
love
thee
yes
i
feel
that
on
the
fountain
of
my
heart
a
seal
is
set
to
keep
its
waters
pure
and
bright
for
thee
since
in
those
tears
thou
hast
delight
we
are
we
not
formed
as
notes
of
music
are
for
one
another
though
dissimilar
such
difference
without
discord
as
can
make
those
sweetest
sounds
in
which
all
spirits
shake
as
trembling
leaves
in
a
continuous
air
thy
wisdom
speaks
in
me
and
bids
me
dare
beacon
the
rocks
on
which
high
hearts
are
wrecked
i
never
was
attached
to
that
great
sect
whose
doctrine
is
that
each
one
should
select
out
of
the
crowd
a
mistress
or
a
friend
and
all
the
rest
though
fair
and
wise
commend
to
cold
oblivion
though
it
is
in
the
code
of
modern
morals
and
the
beaten
road
which
those
poor
slaves
with
weary
footsteps
tread
who
travel
to
their
home
among
the
dead
by
the
broad
highway
of
the
world
and
so
with
one
chained
friend
perhaps
a
jealous
foe
the
dreariest
and
the
longest
journey
go
true
love
in
this
differs
from
gold
and
clay
that
to
divide
is
not
to
take
away
love
is
like
understanding
that
grows
bright
gazing
on
many
truths
is
like
thy
light
imagination
which
from
earth
and
sky
and
from
the
depths
of
human
fantasy
as
from
a
thousand
prisms
and
mirrors
fills
the
universe
with
glorious
beams
and
kills
error
the
worm
with
many
a
arrow
of
its
reverberated
lightning
narrow
the
heart
that
loves
the
brain
that
contemplates
the
life
that
wears
the
spirit
that
creates
one
object
and
one
form
and
builds
thereby
a
sepulchre

mind

differs
most
in
this

from

from

the

from
the
nobler
the

what
is

and

if

you

this

is
that
deep
well
whence
sages
draw
the
unenvied
light
of
hope
the
eternal
law
by
which
those
live
to
whom
this
world
of
life
is
as
a
garden
ravaged
and
whose
strife
tills
for
the
promise
of
a
later
birth
the
wilderness
of
this
elysian
earth
there
was
a
being
whom
my
spirit
oft
met
on
its
visioned
wanderings
far
aloft
in
the
clear
golden
prime
of
my
youth
dawn
upon
the
fairy
isles
of
sunny
lawn
amid
the
enchanted
mountains
and
the
caves
of
divine
sleep
and
on
the
waves
of
dream
whose
tremulous
floor
paved
her
light
steps
on
an
imagined
shore
under
the
gray
beak
of
some
promontory
she
met
me
robed
in
such
exceeding
glory
that
i
beheld
her
not
in
solitudes
her
voice
came
to
me
through
the
whispering
woods
and
from
the
fountains
and
the
odours
deep
of
flowers
which
like
lips
murmuring
in
their
sleep
of
the
sweet
kisses
which
had
lulled
them
there
breathed
but
of
her
to
the
enamoured
air
and
from
the
breezes
whether
low
or
loud
and
from
the
rain
of
every
passing
cloud
and
from
the
singing
of
the
and
from
all
sounds
all
silence
in
the
words
of
antique
verse
and
high
romance
in
form
sound
colour
in
whatever
checks
that
storm
which
with
the
shattered
present
chokes
the
past
and
in
that
best
philosophy
whose
taste
makes
this
cold
common
hell
our
life
a
doom
as
glorious
as
a
fiery
martyrdom
her
spirit
was
the
harmony
of
then
from
the
caverns
of
my
dreamy
youth
i
sprang
as
one
sandalled
with
plumes
of
fire
and
towards
the
lodestar
of
my
one
desire
i
flitted
like
a
dizzy
moth
whose
flight
is
as
a
dead
leaf
in
the
owlet
light
when
it
would
seek
in
hesper
setting
sphere
a
radiant
death
a
fiery
sepulchre
as
if
it
were
a
lamp
of
earthly
but
she
whom
prayers
or
tears
then
could
not
tame
passed
like
a
god
throned
on
a
winged
planet
whose
burning
plumes
to
tenfold
swiftness
fan
it
into
the
dreary
cone
of
our
life
shade
and
as
a
man
with
mighty
loss
dismayed
i
would
have
followed
though
the
grave
between
yawned
like
a
gulf
whose
spectres
are
unseen
when
a
voice
said
thou
of
hearts
the
weakest
the
phantom
is
beside
thee
whom
thou
seekest
then
i
the
world
echo
answered
and
in
that
silence
and
in
my
despair
i
questioned
every
tongueless
wind
that
flew
over
my
tower
of
mourning
if
it
knew
whither
was
fled
this
soul
out
of
my
soul
and
murmured
names
and
spells
which
have
control
over
the
sightless
tyrants
of
our
fate
but
neither
prayer
nor
verse
could
dissipate
the
night
which
closed
on
her
nor
uncreate
that
world
within
this
chaos
mine
and
me
of
which
she
was
the
veiled
divinity
the
world
i
say
of
thoughts
that
worshipped
her
and
therefore
i
went
forth
with
hope
and
fear
and
every
gentle
passion
sick
to
death
feeding
my
course
with
expectation
breath
into
the
wintry
forest
of
our
life
and
struggling
through
its
error
with
vain
strife
and
stumbling
in
my
weakness
and
my
haste
and
half
bewildered
by
new
forms
i
passed
seeking
among
those
untaught
foresters
if
i
could
find
one
form
resembling
hers
in
which
she
might
have
masked
herself
from
me
there
one
whose
voice
was
venomed
melody
sate
by
a
well
under
blue
nightshade
bowers
the
breath
of
her
false
mouth
was
like
faint
flowers
her
touch
was
as
electric
poison
flame
out
of
her
looks
into
my
vitals
came
and
from
her
living
cheeks
and
bosom
flew
a
killing
air
which
pierced
like
into
the
core
of
my
green
heart
and
lay
upon
its
leaves
until
as
hair
grown
gray
a
young
brow
they
hid
its
unblown
prime
with
ruins
of
unseasonable
time
in
many
mortal
forms
i
rashly
sought
the
shadow
of
that
idol
of
my
thought
and
some
were
fair
but
beauty
dies
away
others
were
wise
but
honeyed
words
betray
and
one
was
true
oh
why
not
true
to
me
then
as
a
hunted
deer
that
could
not
flee
i
turned
upon
my
thoughts
and
stood
at
bay
wounded
and
weak
and
panting
the
cold
day
trembled
for
pity
of
my
strife
and
pain
when
like
a
noonday
dawn
there
shone
again
deliverance
one
stood
on
my
path
who
seemed
as
like
the
glorious
shape
which
i
had
d
reamed
as
is
the
moon
whose
changes
ever
run
into
themselves
to
the
eternal
sun
the
cold
chaste
moon
the
queen
of
heaven
bright
isles
who
makes
all
beautiful
on
which
she
smiles
that
wandering
shrine
of
soft
yet
icy
flame
which
ever
is
transformed
yet
still
the
same
and
warms
not
but
illumines
young
and
fair
as
the
descended
spirit
of
that
sphere
she
hid
me
as
the
moon
may
hide
the
night
from
its
own
darkness
until
all
was
bright
between
the
heaven
and
earth
of
my
calm
mind
and
as
a
cloud
charioted
by
the
wind
she
led
me
to
a
cave
in
that
wild
place
and
sate
beside
me
with
her
downward
face
illumining
my
slumbers
like
the
moon
waxing
and
waning
endymion
and
i
was
laid
asleep
spirit
and
limb
and
all
my
being
became
bright
or
dim
as
the
moon
image
in
a
summer
sea
according
as
she
smiled
or
frowned
on
me
and
there
i
lay
within
a
chaste
cold
bed
alas
i
then
was
nor
alive
nor
dead
for
at
her
silver
voice
came
death
and
life
unmindful
each
of
their
accustomed
strife
masked
like
twin
babes
a
sister
and
a
brother
the
wandering
hopes
of
one
abandoned
mother
and
through
the
cavern
without
wings
they
flew
and
cried
he
is
not
of
our
crew
i
wept
and
though
it
be
a
dream
i
weep
what
storms
then
shook
the
ocean
of
my
sleep
blotting
that
moon
whose
pale
and
waning
lips
then
shrank
as
in
the
sickness
of
eclipse
and
how
my
soul
was
as
a
lampless
sea
and
who
was
then
its
tempest
and
when
she
the
planet
of
that
hour
was
quenched
what
frost
crept
those
waters
till
from
coast
to
coast
the
moving
billows
of
my
being
fell
into
a
death
of
ice
immovable
and
then
what
earthquakes
made
it
gape
and
split
the
white
moon
smiling
all
the
while
on
it
these
words
conceal
if
not
each
word
would
be
the
key
of
staunchless
tears
weep
not
for
me
at
length
into
the
obscure
forest
came
the
vision
i
had
sought
through
grief
and
shame
athwart
that
wintry
wilderness
of
thorns
flashed
from
her
motion
splendour
like
the
morn
and
from
her
presence
life
was
radiated
through
the
gray
earth
and
branches
bare
and
dead
so
that
her
way
was
paved
and
roofed
above
with
flowers
as
soft
as
thoughts
of
budding
love
and
music
from
her
respiration
spread
like
light
all
other
sounds
were
penetrated
by
the
small
still
sweet
spirit
of
that
sound
so
that
the
savage
winds
hung
mute
around
and
odours
warm
and
fresh
fell
from
her
hair
dissolving
the
dull
cold
in
the
frore
air
soft
as
an
incarnation
of
the
sun
when
light
is
changed
to
love
this
glorious
one
floated
into
the
cavern
where
i
lay
and
called
my
spirit
and
the
dreaming
clay
was
lifted
by
the
thing
that
dreamed
below
as
smoke
by
fire
and
in
her
beauty
glow
i
stood
and
felt
the
dawn
of
my
long
night
was
penetrating
me
with
living
light
i
knew
it
was
the
vision
veiled
from
me
so
many
years
that
it
was
emily
twin
spheres
of
light
who
rule
this
passive
earth
this
world
of
loves
this
me
and
into
birth
awaken
all
its
fruits
and
flowers
and
dart
magnetic
might
into
its
central
heart
and
lift
its
billows
and
its
mists
and
guide
by
everlasting
laws
each
wind
and
tide
to
its
fit
cloud
and
its
appointed
cave
and
lull
its
storms
each
in
the
craggy
grave
which
was
its
cradle
luring
to
faint
bowers
the
armies
of
the
showers
and
as
those
married
lights
which
from
the
towers
of
heaven
look
forth
and
fold
the
wandering
globe
in
liquid
sleep
and
splendour
as
a
robe
and
all
their
influence
blend
if
equal
yet
unlike
to
one
sweet
end
so
ye
bright
regents
with
alternate
sway
govern
my
sphere
of
being
night
and
day
thou
not
disdaining
even
a
borrowed
might
thou
not
eclipsing
a
remoter
light
and
through
the
shadow
of
the
seasons
three
from
spring
to
autumn
sere
maturity
light
it
into
the
winter
of
the
tomb
where
it
may
ripen
to
a
brighter
bloom
thou
too
o
comet
beautiful
and
fierce
who
drew
the
heart
of
this
frail
universe
towards
thine
own
till
wrecked
in
that
convulsion
alternating
attraction
and
repulsion
thine
went
astray
and
that
was
rent
in
twain
oh
float
into
our
azure
heaven
again
be
there
love
at
thy
return
the
living
sun
will
feed
thee
from
its
urn
of
golden
fire
the
moon
will
veil
her
horn
in
thy
last
smiles
adoring
even
and
morn
will
worship
thee
with
incense
of
calm
breath
and
lights
and
shadows
as
the
star
of
death
and
birth
is
worshipped
by
those
sisters
wild
called
hope
and
fear
upon
the
heart
are
piled
their
offerings
of
this
sacrifice

a

not
these
flowers
of
thought
the
fading
birth
which
from
its
heart
of
hearts
that
plant
puts
forth
whose
fruit
made
perfect
by
thy
sunny
eyes
will
be
as
of
the
trees
of
paradise
the
day
is
come
and
thou
wilt
fly
with
me
to
of
dull
mortality

mine
remain
a
vestal
sister
still
to
the
intense
the
deep
the
imperishable
not

me
henceforth
be
thou

even
as
a
bride
delighting
and
delighted
the
hour

come
the
destined
star
has
risen
which
shall
descend
upon
a
vacant
prison
the
walls
are
high
the
gates
are
strong
thick
set
the
sentinels
but
true
love
never
yet
was
thus
constrained
it
overleaps
all

like
lightning
with
invisible
violence
piercing
its
continents
like
heaven
free
breath
which

who
grasps

who
rides
upon

his
way
through
temple

the
array
of

more
strength
has
love
than
he
or
they
for
it
can
burst
his
charnel
and
make
free
the
limbs
in
chains

chaos
emily
a
ship
is
floating
in
the
harbour
now
a
wind
is
hovering
the

there
is
a
path
on
the

azure
floor
no
keel
has
ever
ploughed
that
path
before
the
halcyons
brood
around
the
foamless

the
treacherous
ocean
has
forsworn
its
wiles
the
merry
mariners
are
bold
and
free
say
my

sister
wilt
thou
sail
with
me
our
bark
is
as
an
albatross
whose
nest
is
a
far
eden
of
the
purple
east
and
we
between
her
wings
will
sit
while
night
and
day
and
storm
and
calm
pursue
their
flight
our
ministers
along
the
boundless
sea
treading
each
other
heels
unheededly
it
is
an
isle
under
ionian
skies
beautiful
as
a
wreck
of
paradise
and
for
the
harbours
are
not
safe
and
good
this
land
would
have
remained
a
solitude
but
for
some
pastoral
people
native
there
who
from
the
elysian
clear
and
golden
air
draw
the
last
spirit
of
the
age
of
gold
simple
and
spirited
innocent
and
bold
the
blue
aegean
girds
this
chosen
home
with
sound
and
light
and
foam
kissing
the
sifted
sands
and
caverns
hoar
and
all
the
winds
wandering
along
the
shore
undulate
with
the
undulating
tide
there
are
thick
woods
where
sylvan
forms
abide
and
many
a
fountain
rivulet
and
pond
as
clear
as
elemental
diamond
or
serene
morning
air
and
far
beyond
the
mossy
tracks
made
by
the
goats
and
deer
which
the
rough
shepherd
treads
but
once
a
year
pierce
into
glades
caverns
and
bowers
and
halls
built
round
with
ivy
which
the
waterfalls
illumining
with
sound
that
never
fails
accompany
the
noonday
nightingales
and
all
the
place
is
peopled
with
sweet
airs
the
light
clear
element
which
the
isle
wears
is
heavy
with
the
scent
of
which
floats
like
mist
laden
with
unseen
showers
and
falls
upon
the
eyelids
like
faint
sleep
and
from
the
moss
violets
and
jonquils
peep
and
dart
their
arrowy
odour
through
the
brain
till
you
might
faint
with
that
delicious
pain
and
every
motion
odour
beam
and
tone
with
that
deep
music
is
in
unison
which
is
a
soul
within
the
soul
they
seem
like
echoes
of
an
antenatal
it
is
an
isle
heaven

earth
and
sea
cradled
and
hung
in
clear
tranquillity
bright
as
that

washed
by

it

famine

upon

vultures

onward

upon
their
fatal
way
the
winged
storms
chanting
their
to
other
lands
leave
azure
chasms
of
calm
over
this
isle
or
weep
themselves
in
dew
from
which
its
fields
and
woods
ever
renew
their
green
and
golden
immortality
and
from
the
sea
there
rise
and
from
the
sky
there
fall
clear
exhalations
soft
and
bright
veil
after
veil
each
hiding
some
delight
which
sun
or
moon
or
zephyr
draw
aside
till
the
isle
beauty
like
a
naked
bride
glowing
at
once
with
love
and
loveliness
blushes
and
trembles
at
its
own
excess
yet
like
a
buried
lamp
a
soul
no
less
burns
in
the
heart
of
this
delicious
isle
an
atom
of
th
eternal
whose
own
smile
unfolds
itself
and
may
be
felt
not
seen
the
gray
rocks
blue
waves
and
forests
green
filling
their
bare
and
void
but
the
chief
marvel
of
the
wilderness
is
a
lone
dwelling
built
by
whom
or
how
none
of
the
rustic
know
not
a
tower
of
strength
though
with
its
height
it
overtops
the
woods
but
for
delight
some
wise
and
tender
ere
crime
had
been
invented
in
the
world
young
prime
reared
it
a
wonder
of
that
simple
time
an
envy
of
the
isles
a
made
sacred
to
his
sister
and
his
spouse
it
scarce
seems
now
a
wreck
of
human
art
but
as
it
were
titanic
in
the
heart
of
earth
having
assumed
its
form
then
grown
out
of
the
mountains
from
the
living
stone
lifting
itself
in
caverns
light
and
high
for
all
the
antique
and
learned
imagery
has
been
erased
and
in
the
place
of
it
the
ivy
and
the
interknit
the
volumes
of
their
stems
parasite
flowers
illume
with
dewy
gems
the
lampless
halls
and
when
they
fade
the
sky
peeps
through
their
of
tracery
with
moonlight
patches
or
star
atoms
keen
or
fragments
of
the
day
intense
serene
working
mosaic
on
their
parian
floors
and
day
and
night
aloof
from
the
high
towers
and
terraces
the
earth
and
ocean
seem
to
sleep
in
one
another
arms
and
dream
of
waves
flowers
clouds
woods
rocks
and
all
that
we
read
in
their
smiles
and
call
reality
this
isle
and
house
are
mine
and
i
have
vowed
thee
to
be
lady
of
the
and
i
have
fitted
up
some
chambers
there
looking
towards
the
golden
eastern
air
and
level
with
the
living
winds
which
flow
like
waves
above
the
living
waves
i
have
sent
books
and
music
there
and
all
those
instruments
with
which
high
spirits
call
the
future
from
its
cradle
and
the
past
out
of
its

with

at

an

his

on

his
fate
is
an
additional
proof
that
tree
of
knowledge
is
not
that

he
had
framed
to
himself
certain
opinions
founded
no

but
built
up
to
a

height
they
fell
by

the
thoughts
that
were
his
architects
became
unintelligible
one
to
the

as
men
upon

have

of

have

the

no

may
easily
be

by
those
to
whom
the

was

in
the

a
young
englishman
who
died
on
his
passage
from
leghorn
to
the
levant
he
had
bought
one
of
the
sporades
he
was
accompanied
by
a
lady
who
might
have
been
supposed
to
be
his
wife
an
effeminate
looking
youth
to
whom
he
shewed
an
attachment
so
singular
excessive
an
attachment
as
to
give
rise
to
the
suspicion
that
she
was
a
woman
at
his
death
this
suspicion
was
confirmed
object
speedily
found
a
refuge
both
from
the
taunts
of
the
brute
multitude
and
from
the
of
her
grief
in
the
same
grave
that
contained
her
he
had
bought
one
of
the
sporades
fitted
up
a
saracenic
castle
which
accident
had
preserved
in
some
repair
with
simple
elegance
it
was
his
intention
to
dedicate
the
remainder
of
his
life
to
undisturbed
intercourse
with

apparently
were
intended
as
a

of

of

died
at

was
preparing
for
one
wildest
of
the
of
the
sporades
where
he
bought
fitted
up
the
ruins
of
some
old
building
his
life
was
singular
less
on

of
the
romantic
vicissitudes
which
diversified
it
than
the
ideal
tinge
which
they
received
from
his
own
character

the
verses
were
apparently
intended
by
the
writer
to
accompany
some
longer
poem

collection
of
poems
of
which
are

it

my
dear
friend
is
a
new
book
for
you
i
have
already
dedicated
two
to
other
friends
one
female
and
one
male
what
you
are
is
a
thing
that
i
must
veil
what
can
this
be
to
those
who
praise
or
rail
i
never
was
attached
to
that
great
sect
whose
doctrine
is
that
each
one
should
select
out
of
the
world
a
mistress
or
a
friend
and
all
the
rest
though
fair
and
wise
commend
to
cold
oblivion
though
is
in
the
code
of
modern
morals
and
the
beaten
road
which
those
poor
slaves
with
weary
footsteps
tread
who
travel
to
their
home
among
the
dead
by
the
broad
highway
of
the
world
and
so
with
one
sad
friend
and
many
a
jealous
foe
the
dreariest
and
the
longest
journey
go
free
love
has
this
different
from
gold
and
clay
that
to
divide
is
not
to
take
away
like
ocean
which
the
general
north
wind
breaks
into
ten
thousand
waves
and
each
one
makes
a
mirror
of
the
moon
like
some
great
glass
which
did
distort
whatever
form
might
pass
dashed
into
fragments
by
a
playful
child
which
then
reflects
its
eyes
and
forehead
mild
giving
for
one
which
it
could
express
a
thousand
images
of
loveliness
if
i
were
one
whom
the
loud
world
held
wise
i
should
disdain
to
quote
authorities
in
commendation
of
this
kind
of
love
why
there
is
first
the
god
in
heaven
above
who
wrote
a
book
called
nature
is
to
be
reviewed
i
hear
in
the
next
quarterly
and
socrates
the
jesus
christ
of
greece
and
jesus
christ
himself
did
never
cease
to
urge
all
living
things
to
love
each
other
and
to
forgive
their
mutual
faults
and
smother
the
devil
of
disunion
in
their
souls
i
love
you
listen
o
embodied
ray
of
the
great
brightness
i
must
pass
away
while
you
remain
and
these
light
words
must
be
tokens
by
which
you
may
remember
me
start
not
the
thing
you
are
is
unbetrayed
if
you
are
human
and
if
but
the
shade
of
some
sublimer
spirit
and
as
to
friend
or
mistress
is
a
form
perhaps
i
wish
you
were
one
some
declare
you
a
familiar
spirit
as
you
are
others
with
a
more
inhuman
hint
that
though
not
my
wife
you
are
a
woman
what
is
the
colour
of
your
eyes
and
hair
why
if
you
were
a
lady
it
were
fair
the
world
should
know
but
as
i
am
afraid
the
quarterly
would
bait
you
if
betrayed
and
if
as
it
will
be
sport
to
see
them
stumble
over
all
sorts
of
scandals
hear
them
mumble
their
litany
of
curses
some
guess
right
and
others
swear
you
a
hermaphrodite
like
that
sweet
marble
monster
of
both
sexes
which
looks
so
sweet
and
gentle
that
it
vexes
the
very
soul
that
the
soul
is
gone
which
lifted
from
her
limbs
the
veil
of
stone
it
is
a
sweet
thing
friendship
a
dear
balm
a
happy
and
auspicious
bird
of
calm
which
rides

ever
tumultuous

that

chaos
in
commotion
a
flower
which
fresh
as

its
bold
head
into
the
world
frore

and
blooms
most
radiantly
when
others
die
health
hope

youth
and
brief
prosperity
and
with
the
light
and
odour
of
its
bloom
shining
within
the
dun

and
the
tomb
whose
coming
is
as
light
and
music
are
dissonance
and
gloom
a
star
which
moves
not
the
moving
heavens
alone
a
smile
among
dark
frowns

gentle

among
rude
voices
a

solitude

i
have
three
even
by
my
own
confession
there
may
be
some
more
for
what
i
know
for
is
my
mind
to
call
my
friends
all
who
are
wise
and
kind
and
these
heaven
knows
at
best
are
very
few
but
none
can
ever
be
more
dear
than
you
why
should
they
be
my
muse

lost
her
wings
or
like
a
dying
swan
who
soars

i
should
describe
you
in

as
it
is
are
you
not
void
of
guile
a
lovely
soul
formed
to
be
blessed
and
bless
a
well
of
sealed

secret
happiness
a

those
whom

to

rebuked

and
you
that
you
are
faultless
would
to

they
were
who
taunt
me
with
your

i
then
should
wear
these
heavy
chains
of

with
a

and
would
to

i
were

even
as
near
it
as
you
dear

alas
what
are
we
clouds
driven
by
the
wind
in
warring
multitudes
which
rain
into
the
bosom
of
the
earth
and
rise
again
and
in
our
death
and
birth
and
through
our
restless
life
take
as
from

hues
which
are
not
our

but
which
are
given

then
withdrawn

with
inconstant
glance

is
a
power

a

seraph

seemed
to
be
wonderful
and
the
immortality
of
this
great
world
which
all
things
must
inherit
was
felt
as
one
with
the
awakening

unconscious
of
itself

of
the
strange
distinctions
which
in

it
is
my
intention
to
subjoin
to
the
london
edition
of
this
poem
a
criticism
upon
the
claims
of
its
lamented
object
to
be
classed
among
the
writers
of
the
highest
genius
who
have
adorned
our
age
my
known
repugnance
to
the
narrow
principles
of
taste
on
which
several
of
his
earlier
compositions
were
modelled
prove
at
least
that
i
am
an
impartial
judge
i
consider
the
fragment
of
hyperion
as
second
to
nothing
that
was
ever
produced
by
a
writer
of
the
same
years
john
keats
died
at
rome
of
a
consumption
in
his
year
on
the
of
and
was
buried
in
the
romantic
and
lonely
cemetery
of
the
protestants
in
that
city
under
the
pyramid
which
is
the
tomb
of
cestius
and
the
massy
walls
and
towers
now
mouldering
and
desolate
which
formed
the
circuit
of
ancient
rome
the
cemetery
is
an
open
space
among
the
ruins
covered
in
winter
with
violets
and
daisies
it
might
make
one
in
love
with
death
to
think
that
one
should
be
buried
in
so
sweet
a
place
the
genius
of
the
lamented
person
to
whose
memory
i
have
dedicated
these
unworthy
verses
was
not
less
delicate
and
fragile
than
it
was
beautiful
and
where
cankerworms
abound
what
wonder
if
its
young
flower
was
blighted
in
the
bud
the
savage
criticism
on
his
endymion
which
appeared
in
the
quarterly
review
produced
the
most
violent
effect
on
his
susceptible
mind
the
agitation
thus
originated
ended
in
the
rupture
of
a
in
the
lungs
a
rapid
consumption
ensued
and
the
succeeding
acknowledgements
from
more
candid
critics
of
the
true
greatness
of
his
powers
were
ineffectual
to
heal
the
wound
thus
wantonly
inflicted
it
may
be
well
said
that
these
wretched
men
know
not
what
they
do
they
scatter
their
insults
and
their
slanders
without
heed
as
to
whether
the
poisoned
shaft
lights
on
a
heart
made
callous
by
many
blows
or
one
like
keats
composed
of
more
penetrable
stuff
one
of
their
associates
is
to
my
knowledge
a
most
base
and
unprincipled
calumniator
as
to
endymion
was
it
a
poem
whatever
might
be
its
defects
to
be
treated
contemptuously
by
those
who
had
celebrated
with
various
degrees
of
complacency
and
panegyric
paris
and
woman
and
a
syrian
tale
and
lefanu
and
barrett
and
howard
payne
and
a
long
list
of
the
illustrious
obscure
are
these
the
men
who
in
their
venal
good
nature
presumed
to
draw
a
parallel
between
the
reverend
milman
and
lord
byron
what
gnat
did
they
strain
at
here
after
having
swallowed
all
those
camels
against
what
woman
taken
in
adultery
dares
the
foremost
of
these
literary
prostitutes
to
cast
his
opprobrious
stone
miserable
man
you
one
of
the
meanest
have
wantonly
defaced
one
of
the
noblest
specimens
of
the
workmanship
of
god
nor
shall
it
be
your
excuse
that
murderer
as
you
are
you
have
spoken
daggers
but
used
none
the
circumstances
of
the
closing
scene
of
poor
keats
life
were
not
made
known
to
me
until
the
elegy
was
ready
for
the
press
i
am
given
to
understand
that
the
wound
which
his
sensitive
spirit
had
received
from
the
criticism
of
endymion
was
exasperated
by
the
bitter
sense
of
unrequited
benefits
the
poor
fellow
seems
to
have
been
hooted
from
the
stage
of
life
no
less
by
those
on
whom
he
had
wasted
the
promise
of
his
genius
than
those
on
whom
he
had
lavished
his
fortune
and
his
care
he
was
accompanied
to
rome
and
attended
in
his
last
illness
by
severn
a
young
artist
of
the
highest
promise
who
i
have
been
informed
risked
his
own
life
and
sacrificed
every
prospect
to
unwearied
attendance
upon
his
dying
friend
had
i
known
these
circumstances
before
the
completion
of
my
poem
i
should
have
been
tempted
to
add
my
feeble
tribute
of
applause
to
the
more
solid
recompense
which
the
virtuous
man
finds
in
the
recollection
of
his
own
motives
severn
can
dispense
with
a
reward
from
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
of
his
conduct
is
a
golden
augury
of
the
success
of
his
future
career
may
the
unextinguished
spirit
of
his
illustrious
friend
animate
the
creations
of
his
pencil
and
plead
against
oblivion
for
his
name
adonais
i
weep
for

he

our

after
their

pain
they
will
gather
strength
or
find
a

again

loosened
from

lost
angel
of
a
ruined
paradise

knew
not
was
her
own
as
with
no
stain
she
faded
like
a
cloud
which
had
outwept
its
rain
one
from
a
lucid
urn
of
starry
dew
washed
his
light
limbs
as
if
embalming
them
another
clipped
her
profuse
locks
and
threw
the
wreath
upon
him
like
an
anadem
which
frozen
tears
instead
of
pearls
begem
another
in
her
wilful
grief
would
break
her
bow
and
winged
reeds
as
if
to
stem
a
greater
loss
with
one
which
was
more
weak
and
dull

barbed
fire
against
his
frozen
cheek
another
splendour
on
his
mouth

that
mouth
whence
it
was

to
draw
the
breath
which
gave
it
strength
to
pierce
the
guarded
wit
and
pass
into
the
panting
heart
beneath
with
lightning
and
with
music
the
damp
death
quenched
its
caress
upon
his
icy
lips
and
as
a
dying
meteor
stains
a
wreath
of
moonlight
vapour
which
the
cold
night
clips
it
flushed
through
his
pale
limbs
and
passed
to
its
eclipse

came

persuasions
and
veiled
destinies

by
the

a
corpse
sorrow
and
fear
so
struck
so
roused
so
rapped
urania
so
saddened
round
her
like
an
atmosphere
of
stormy
mist
so
swept
her
on
her
way
even
to
the
mournful
place
where
adonais
lay
out
of
her
secret
paradise
she
sped
through
camps
and
cities
rough
with
stone
and
steel
and
human
hearts
which
to
her
aery
tread
yielding
not
wounded
the
invisible
palms
of
her
tender
feet
they
fell
and
barbed
tongues
and
thoughts
more
sharp
than
they
rent
the
soft
form
they
never
could
repel
whose
sacred
blood
like
the
young
tears
of
may
paved
with
eternal
flowers
that
undeserving
way
in
the
for
a
moment
death
shamed
by
the
presence
of
that
living
might
blushed
to
annihilation
and
the
breath
revisited
those
lips
and
life
pale
light
flashed
through
those
limbs
so
late
her
dear
delight
me
not
wild
and
drear
and
comfortless
as
silent
lightning
leaves
the
starless
night
leave
me
not
cried
urania
her
distress
roused
death
death
rose
and
smiled
and
met
her
vain
caress
yet
awhile
speak
to
me
once
again
kiss
me
so
long
but
as
a
kiss
may
live
and
in
my
heartless
breast
and
burning
brain
that
word
that
kiss
shall
all
thoughts
else
survive
with
food
of
saddest
memory
kept
alive
now
thou
art
dead
as
if
it
were
a
part
of
thee
my
adonais
i
would
give
all
that
i
am
to
be
as
thou
now
art
but
i
am
chained
to
time
and
can
not
thence
depart
gentle
child
beautiful
as
thou
wert
why
didst
thou
leave
the
trodden
paths
of
men
too
soon
and
with
weak
hands
though
mighty
heart
dare
the
unpastured
dragon
in
his
den
defenceless
as
thou
wert
oh
where
was
then
wisdom
the
mirrored
shield
or
scorn
the
spear
or
hadst
thou
waited
the
full
cycle
when
thy
spirit
should
have
filled
its
crescent
sphere
the
monsters
of
life
waste
had
fled
from
thee
like
deer
herded
wolves
bold
only
to
pursue
the
obscene
ravens
clamorous
the
dead
the
vultures
to
the
conqueror
banner
true
who
feed
where
desolation
first
has
fed
and
whose
wings
rain
contagion
how
they
fled
when
like
apollo
from
his
golden
bow
the
pythian
of
the
age
one
arrow
sped
and
smiled
the
spoilers
tempt
no
second
blow
they
fawn
on
the
proud
feet
that
spurn
them
lying
low
sun
comes
forth
and
many
reptiles
spawn
he
sets
and
each
ephemeral
insect
then
is
gathered
into
death
without
a
dawn
and
the
immortal
stars
awake
again
so
is
it
in
the
world
of
living
men
a
godlike
mind
soars
forth
in
its
delight
making
earth
bare
and
veiling
heaven
and
when
it
sinks
the
swarms
that
dimmed
or
shared
its
light
leave
to
its
kindred
lamps
the
spirit
awful
night
thus
ceased
she
and
the
mountain
shepherds
came
their
garlands
sere
their
magic
mantles
rent
the
pilgrim
of
eternity
whose
fame
over
his
living
head
like
heaven
is
bent
an
early
but
enduring
monument
came
veiling
all
the
lightnings
of
his
song
in
sorrow
from
her
wilds
ierne
sent
the
sweetest
lyrist
of
her
saddest
wrong
and
love
taught
grief
to
fall
like
music
from
his
tongue
midst
others
of
less
note
came
one
frail
form
a
phantom
among
men
companionless
as
the
last
cloud
of
an
expiring
storm
whose
thunder
is
its
knell
he
as
i
guess
had
gazed
on
nature
naked
loveliness
and
now
he
fled
astray
with
feeble
steps
the
world
wilderness
and
his
own
thoughts
along
that
rugged
way
pursued
like
raging
hounds
their
father
and
their
prey
a
pardlike
spirit
beautiful
and
swift
a
love
in
desolation
masked
a
power
girt
round
with
weakness
it
can
scarce
uplift
the
weight
of
the
superincumbent
hour
it
is
a
dying
lamp
a
falling
shower
a
breaking
billow
even
whilst
we
speak
is
it
not
broken
on
the
withering
flower
the
killing
sun
smiles
brightly
on
a
cheek
the
life
can
burn
in
blood
even
while
the
heart
may
break
his
head
was
bound
with
pansies
overblown
and
faded
violets
white
and
pied
and
blue
and
a
light
spear
topped
with
a
cypress
cone
round
whose
rude
shaft
dark
grew
yet
dripping
with
the
forest
noonday
dew
vibrated
as
the
heart
shook
the
weak
hand
that
grasped
it
of
that
crew
he
came
the
last
neglected
and
apart
a
deer
struck
by
the
hunter
dart
all
stood
aloof
and
at
his
partial
moan
smiled
through
their
tears
well
knew
that
gentle
band
who
in
another
fate
now
wept
his
own
as
in
the
accents
of
an
unknown
land
he
sung
new
sorrow
sad
urania
scanned
the
stranger
mien
and
murmured
art
thou
he
answered
not
but
with
a
sudden
hand
made
bare
his
branded
and
ensanguined
brow
which
was
like
cain
or
christ
oh
that
it
should
be
so
what
softer
voice
is
hushed
over
the
dead
athwart
what
brow
is
that
dark
mantle
thrown
what
form
leans
sadly
the
white
in
mockery
of
monumental
stone
the
heavy
heart
heaving
without
a
moan
if
it
be
he
who
gentlest
of
the
wise
taught
soothed
loved
honoured
the
departed
one
let
me
not
vex
with
inharmonious
sighs
the
silence
of
that
heart
accepted
sacrifice
our
adonais
has
drunk
poison
oh
what
deaf
and
viperous
murderer
could
crown
life
early
cup
with
such
a
draught
of
woe
the
nameless
worm
would
now
itself
disown
it
felt
yet
could
escape
the
magic
tone
whose
prelude
held
all
envy
hate
and
wrong
but
what
was
howling
in
one
breast
alone
silent
with
expectation
of
the
song
whose
master
hand
is
cold
whose
silver
lyre
unstrung
live
thou
whose
infamy
is
not
thy
fame
live
fear
no
heavier
chastisement
from
me
thou
noteless
blot
on
a
remembered
name
but
be
thyself
and
know
thyself
to
be
and
ever
at
thy
season
be
thou
free
to
spill
the
venom
when
thy
fangs
remorse
and
shall
cling
to
thee
hot
shame
shall
burn
upon
thy
secret
brow
and
like
a
beaten
hound
tremble
thou
shalt
as
now
nor
let
us
weep
that
our
delight
is
fled
far
from
these
carrion
kites
that
scream
below
he
wakes
or
sleeps
with
the
enduring
dead
thou
canst
not
soar
where
he
is
sitting
now
dust
to
the
dust
but
the
pure
spirit
shall
flow
back
to
the
burning
fountain
whence
it
came
a
portion
of
the
eternal
which
must
glow
through
time
and
change
unquenchably
the
same
whilst
thy
cold
embers
choke
the
sordid
hearth
of
shame
peace
peace
he
is
not
dead
he
doth
not
sleep
he
hath
awakened
from
the
dream
of
life
we
who
lost
in
stormy
visions
keep
with
phantoms
an
unprofitable
strife
and
in
mad
trance
strike
with
our
spirit
knife
invulnerable
we
decay
like
corpses
in
a
charnel
fear
and
grief
convulse
us
and
consume
us
day
by
day
and
cold
hopes
swarm
like
worms
within
our
living
clay
he
has
outsoared
the
shadow
of
our
night
envy
and
calumny
and
hate
and
pain
and
that
unrest
which
men
miscall
delight
can
touch
him
not
and
torture
not
again
from
the
contagion
of
the
world
slow
stain
he
is
secure
and
now
can
never
mourn
a
heart
grown
cold
a
head
grown
gray
in
vain
nor
when
the
spirit
self
has
ceased
to
burn
with
sparkless
ashes
load
an
unlamented
urn
he
lives
he
wakes
is
death
is
dead
not
he
mourn
not
for
thou
young
dawn
turn
all
thy
dew
to
splendour
for
from
thee
the
spirit
thou
lamentest
is
not
gone
ye
caverns
and
ye
forests
cease
to
moan
cease
ye
faint
flowers
and
fountains
and
thou
air
which
like
a
mourning
veil
thy
scarf
hadst
thrown
the
abandoned
earth
now
leave
it
bare
even
to
the
joyous
stars
which
smile
on
its
despair
he
is
made
one
with
nature
there
is
heard
his
voice
in
all
her
music
from
the
moan
of
thunder
to
the
song
of
night
sweet
bird
he
is
a
presence
to
be
felt
and
known
in
darkness
and
in
light
from
herb
and
stone
spreading
itself
that
power
may
move
which
has
withdrawn
his
being
to
its
own
which
wields
the
world
with
love
sustains
it
from
beneath
and
kindles
it
above
he
is
a
portion
of
the
loveliness
which
once
he
made
more
lovely
he
doth
bear
his
part
while
the
one
spirit
plastic
stress
sweeps
through
the
dull
dense
world
compelling
there
all
new
successions
to
the
forms
they
wear
torturing
th
unwilling
dross
that
checks
its
flight
to
its
own
likeness
as
each
mass
may
bear
and
bursting
in
its
beauty
and
its
might
from
trees
and
beasts
and
men
into
the
heaven
light
the
splendours
of
the
firmament
of
time
may
be
eclipsed
but
are
extinguished
not
like
stars
to
their
appointed
height
they
climb
and
death
is
a
low
mist
which
can
not
blot
the
brightness
it
may
veil
when
lofty
thought
lifts
a
young
heart
above
its
mortal
lair
and
love
and
life
contend
in
it
for
what
shall
be
its
earthly
doom
the
dead
live
there
and
move
like
winds
of
light
on
dark
and
stormy
air
the
inheritors
of
unfulfilled
renown
rose
from
their
thrones
built
beyond
mortal
thought
far
in
the
unapparent
chatterton
rose
pale
his
solemn
agony
had
not
yet
faded
from
him
sidney
as
he
fought
and
as
he
fell
and
as
he
lived
and
loved
sublimely
mild
a
spirit
without
spot
arose
and
lucan
by
his
death
approved
oblivion
as
they
rose
shrank
like
a
thing
reproved
and
many
more

on

so

yon

blind
in
unascended
majesty
silent
alone
amid

assume
thy
winged
throne
thou

who

oh
come
forth
fond
wretch
and
know
thyself
and
him

clasp
with
thy

the
pendulous
earth
as
from

thy

until
its

might
satiate
the

then
shrink
even

and
keep
thy

light
lest
it

thee

which

the
sepulchre
oh
not
of
him

of
our
joy
is
nought
that

go
thou
to
rome
at
once
the
paradise
the

the

where
its
wrecks
like
shattered
mountains
rise
and
flowering
weeds
and
fragrant
copses
dress
the
bones
of
desolation
nakedness
pass
till
the

of
the
spot
shall
lead
thy
footsteps
to
a
slope
of
green
access
where
like
an
infant
smile
over
the
dead
a
light
of
laughing
flowers
along
the
grass
is
spread
and
gray
walls
moulder
round
on
which
dull
time
feeds
like
slow
fire
upon
a
hoary
brand
and
one
keen
pyramid
with
wedge
sublime
pavilioning
the
dust
of
him
who
planned
this
refuge
for
his

doth
stand
like

these

falsehood
the
merits
and
demerits
of
his
case
inextricably
entangled
no
personal
offence
should
have
drawn
from
me
this
public
comment
upon
such
stuff
the
offence
of
this
poor
victim
seems
to
have
consisted
solely
in
his
intimacy
with
leigh
hunt
hazlitt
and
some
other
enemies
of
despotism
and
superstition
my
friend
hunt
has
a
very
hard
skull
to
crack
and
will
take
a
deal
of
killing
i
do
not
know
much
of
hazlitt
but
i
knew
personally
but
little
of
keats
but
on
the
news
of
his
situation
i
wrote
to
him
suggesting
the
propriety
of
trying
the
italian
climate
and
inviting
him
to
join
me
unfortunately
he
did
not
allow
me
passages
of
the
poem
and
ever
as
he
went
he
swept
a
lyre
of
unaccustomed
shape
and
strings
now
like
the
of
impetuous
fire
which
shakes
the
forest
with
its
murmurings
now
like
the
rush
of
the
aereal
wings
of
the
enamoured
wind
among
the
treen
whispering
unimaginable
things
and
dying
on
the
streams
of
dew
serene
which
feed
the
unmown
meads
with
green
and
the
green
paradise
which
western
waves
embosom
in
their
sweep
talking
of
freedom
to
their
tongueless
caves
or
to
the
spirits
which
within
them
keep
a
record
of
the
wrongs
which
though
they
sleep
die
not
but
dream
of
retribution
heard
his
hymns
and
echoing
them
from
steep
to
steep
kept
and
then
came
one
of
sweet
and
earnest
looks
whose
soft
smiles
to
his
dark
and
eyes
were
as
the
clear
and
brooks
are
to
the
obscure
fountains
whence
they
rise
showing
how
pure
they
are
a
paradise
of
happy
truth
upon
his
forehead
low
lay
making
wisdom
lovely
in
the
guise
of
morn
upon
the
brow
of
heaven
while
ocean
gleams
below
his
song
though
very
sweet
was
low
and
faint
a
simple
strain
a
mighty
phantasm
half
concealed
in
darkness
of
his
own
exceeding
light
which
clothed
his
awful
presence
unrevealed
charioted
on
the
night
of
whose
skirts
were
chrysolite
and
like
a
sudden
meteor
which
outstrips
the
chariot
of
the
sun
eclipse
the
armies
of
the
golden
stars

is
inscribed
as
an
imperfect
token
of
the
admiration
sympathy
and

of
the
author
pisa
november
preface
the
poem
of
hellas
written
at
the
suggestion
of
the
events
of
the
moment
is
a
mere
improvise
and
derives
its
interest
should
it
be
found
to
possess
any
solely
from
the
intense
sympathy
which
the
author
feels
with
the
cause
he
would
celebrate
the
subject
in
its
present
state
is
insusceptible
of
being
treated
otherwise
than
lyrically
and
if
i
have
called
this
poem
a
drama
from
the
circumstance
of
its
being
composed
in
dialogue
the
licence
is
not
greater
than
that
which
has
been
assumed
by
other
poets
who
have
called
their
productions
epics
only
because
they
have
been
divided
into
twelve
or
books
the
persae
of
aeschylus
afforded
me
the
first
model
of
my
conception
although
the
decision
of
the
glorious
contest
now
waging
in
greece
being
yet
suspended
forbids
a
catastrophe
parallel
to
the
return
of
xerxes
and
the
desolation
of
the
persians
i
have
therefore
contented
myself
with
exhibiting
a
series
of
lyric
pictures
and
with
having
wrought
upon
the
curtain
of
futurity
which
falls
upon
the
unfinished
scene
such
figures
of
indistinct
and
visionary
delineation
as
suggest
the
final
triumph
of
the
greek
cause
as
a
portion
of
the
cause
of
civilisation
and
social
improvement
the
drama
if
drama
it
must
be
called
is
however
so
inartificial
that
i
doubt
whether
if
recited
on
the
thespian
waggon
to
an
athenian
village
at
the
dionysiaca
it
would
have
obtained
the
prize
of
the
goat
i
shall
bear
with
equanimity
any
punishment
greater
than
the
loss
of
such
a
reward
which
the
aristarchi
of
the
hour
may
think
fit
to
inflict
the
only
which
i
have
yet
attempted
has
i
confess
in
spite
of
the
unfavourable
nature
of
the
subject
received
a
greater
and
a
more
valuable
portion
of
applause
than
i
expected
or
than
it
deserved
common
fame
is
the
only
authority
which
i
can
allege
for
the
details
which
form
the
basis
of
the
poem
and
i
must
trespass
upon
the
forgiveness
of
my
readers
for
the
display
of
newspaper
erudition
to
which
i
have
been
reduced
undoubtedly
until
the
conclusion
of
the
war
it
will
be
impossible
to
obtain
an
account
of
it
sufficiently
authentic
for
historical
materials
but
poets
have
their
privilege
and
it
is
unquestionable
that
actions
of
the
most
exalted
courage
have
been
performed
by
the
greeks
that
they
have
gained
more
than
one
naval
victory
and
that
their
defeat
in
wallachia
was
signalized
by
circumstances
of
heroism
more
glorious
even
than
victory
the
apathy
of
the
rulers
of
the
civilised
world
to
the
astonishing
circumstance
of
the
descendants
of
that
nation
to
which
they
owe
their
civilisation
rising
as
it
were
from
the
ashes
of
their
ruin
is
something
perfectly
inexplicable
to
a
mere
spectator
of
the
shows
of
this
mortal
scene
we
are
all
greeks
our
laws
our
literature
our
religion
our
arts
have
their
root
in
greece
but
for
greece
rome
the
instructor
the
conqueror
or
the
metropolis
of
our
ancestors
would
have
spread
no
illumination
with
her
arms
and
we
might
still
have
been
savages
and
idolaters
or
what
is
worse
might
have
arrived
at
such
a
stagnant
and
miserable
state
of
social
institution
as
china
and
japan
possess
the
human
form
and
the
human
mind
attained
to
a
perfection
in
greece
which
has
impressed
its
image
on
those
faultless
productions
whose
very
fragments
are
the
despair
of
modern
art
and
has
propagated
impulses
which
can
not
cease
through
a
thousand
channels
of
manifest
or
imperceptible
operation
to
ennoble
and
delight
mankind
until
the
extinction
of
the
race
the
modern
greek
is
the
descendant
of
those
glorious
beings
whom
the
imagination
almost
refuses
to
figure
to
itself
as
belonging
to
our
kind
and
he
inherits
much
of
their
sensibility
their
rapidity
of
conception
their
enthusiasm
and
their
courage
if
in
many
instances
he
is
degraded
by
moral
and
political
slavery
to
the
practice
of
the
basest
vices
it
engenders
and
that
below
the
level
of
ordinary
degradation
let
us
reflect
that
the
corruption
of
the
best
produces
the
worst
and
that
habits
which
subsist
only
in
relation
to
a
peculiar
state
of
social
institution
may
be
expected
to
cease
as
soon
as
that
relation
is
dissolved
in
fact
the
greeks
since
the
admirable
novel
of
anastasius
could
have
been
a
faithful
picture
of
their
manners
have
undergone
most
important
changes
the
flower
of
their
youth
returning
to
their
country
from
the
universities
of
italy
germany
and
france
have
communicated
to
their
the
latest
results
of
that
social
perfection
of
which
their
ancestors
were
the
original
source
the
university
of
chios
contained
before
the
breaking
out
of
the
revolution
eight
hundred
students
and
among
them
several
germans
and
americans
the
munificence
and
energy
of
many
of
the
greek
princes
and
merchants
directed
to
the
renovation
of
their
country
with
a
spirit
and
a
wisdom
which
has
few
examples
is
above
all
praise
the
english
permit
their
own
oppressors
to
act
according
to
their
natural
sympathy
with
the
turkish
tyrant
and
to
brand
upon
their
name
the
indelible
blot
of
an
alliance
with
the
enemies
of
domestic
happiness
of
christianity
and
civilisation
russia
desires
to
possess
not
to
liberate
greece
and
is
contented
to
see
the
turks
its
natural
enemies
and
the
greeks
its
intended
slaves
enfeeble
each
other
until
one
or
both
fall
into
its
net
the
wise
and
generous
policy
of
england
would
have
consisted
in
establishing
the
independence
of
greece
and
in
maintaining
it
both
against
russia
and
the
turk
but
when
was
the
oppressor
generous
or
just
should
the
english
people
ever
become
free
they
will
reflect
upon
the
part
which
those
who
presume
to
represent
their
will
have
played
in
the
great
drama
of
the
revival
of
liberty
with
feelings
which
it
would
become
them
to
anticipate
this
is
the
age
of
the
war
of
the
oppressed
against
the
oppressors
and
every
one
of
those
ringleaders
of
the
privileged
gangs
of
murderers
and
swindlers
called
sovereigns
look
to
each
other
for
aid
against
the
common
enemy
and
suspend
their
mutual
jealousies
in
the
presence
of
a
mightier
fear
of
this
holy
alliance
all
the
despots
of
the
earth
are
virtual
members
but
a
new
race
has
arisen
throughout
europe
nursed
in
the
abhorrence
of
the
opinions
which
are
its
chains
and
she
will
continue
to
produce
fresh
generations
to
accomplish
that
destiny
which
tyrants
foresee

portentous
and
until

the

seem
indeed
to
have
been
personally
more
innocent
although
it
can
not
be
said
that
as
far
as

are
concerned
they
gave
so
edifying
an
example
as
their
successor

identification

for

note

by
shelley
the
south
of
europe
was
in
a
state
of
great
political
excitement
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
the
spanish
revolution
had
been
a
signal
to
italy
secrete
societies
were
formed
and
when
naples
rose
to
declare
the
constitution
the
call
was
responded
to
from
brundusium
to
the
foot
of
the
alps
to
crush
these
attempts
to
obtain
liberty
early
in
the
austrians
poured
their
armies
into
the
peninsula
at
first
their
coming
rather
seemed
to
add
energy
and
resolution
to
a
people
long
enslaved
the
piedmontese
asserted
their
freedom
genoa
threw
off
the
yoke
of
the
king
of
sardinia
and
as
if
in
playful
imitation
the
people
of
the
little
state
of
massa
and
carrara
gave
the
conge
to
their
sovereign
and
set
up
a
republic
tuscany
alone
was
perfectly
tranquil
it
was
said
that
the
austrian
minister
presented
a
list
of
sixty
carbonari
to
the
grand
duke
urging
their
imprisonment
and
the
grand
duke
replied
do
not
know
whether
these
sixty
men
are
carbonari
but
i
know
if
i
imprison
them
i
shall
directly
have
sixty
thousand
start
up
but
though
the
tuscans
had
no
desire
to
disturb
the
paternal
government
beneath
whose
shelter
they
slumbered
they
regarded
the
progress
of
the
various
italian
revolutions
with
intense
interest
and
hatred
for
the
austrian
was
warm
in
every
bosom
but
they
had
slender
hopes
they
knew
that
the
neapolitans
would
offer
no
fit
resistance
to
the
regular
german
troops
and
that
the
overthrow
of
the
constitution
in
naples
would
act
as
a
decisive
blow
against
all
struggles
for
liberty
in
italy
we
have
seen
the
rise
and
progress
of
reform
but
the
holy
alliance
was
alive
and
active
in
those
days
and
few
could
dream
of
the
peaceful
triumph
of
liberty
it
seemed
then
that
the
armed
assertion
of
freedom
in
the
south
of
europe
was
the
only
hope
of
the
liberals
as
if
it
prevailed
the
nations
of
the
north
would
imitate
the
example
happily
the
reverse
has
proved
the
fact
the
countries
accustomed
to
the
exercise
of
the
privileges
of
freemen
to
a
limited
extent
have
extended
and
are
extending
these
limits
freedom
and
knowledge
have
now
a
chance
of
proceeding
hand
in
hand
and
if
it
continue
thus
we
may
hope
for
the
durability
of
both
then
as
i
have
said
in
shelley
as
well
as
every
other
lover
of
liberty
looked
upon
the
struggles
in
spain
and
italy
as
decisive
of
the
destinies
of
the
world
probably
for
centuries
to
come
the
interest
he
took
in
the
progress
of
affairs
was
intense
when
genoa
declared
itself
free
his
hopes
were
at
their
highest
day
after
day
he
read
the
bulletins
of
the
austrian
army
and
sought
eagerly
to
gather
tokens
of
its
defeat
he
heard
of
the
revolt
of
genoa
with
emotions
of
transport
his
whole
heart
and
soul
were
in
the
triumph
of
the
cause
we
were
living
at
pisa
at
that
time
and
several
italians
at
the
head
of
whom
we
may
place
the
celebrated
vacca
were
accustomed
to
seek
for
sympathy
in
their
hopes
from
shelley
they
did
not
find
such
for
the
despair
they
too
generally
experienced
founded
on
contempt
for
their
southern
countrymen
while
the
fate
of
the
progress
of
the
austrian
armies
then
invading
naples
was
yet
in
suspense
the
news
of
another
revolution
filled
him
with
exultation
we
had
formed
the
acquaintance
at
pisa
of
several
constantinopolitan
greeks
of
the
family
of
prince
caradja
formerly
hospodar
of
wallachia
who
hearing
that
the
bowstring
the
accustomed
finale
of
his
viceroyalty
was
on
the
road
to
him
escaped
with
his
treasures
and
took
up
his
abode
in
tuscany
among
these
was
the
gentleman
to
whom
the
drama
of
hellas
is
dedicated
prince
mavrocordato
was
warmed
by
those
aspirations
for
the
independence
of
his
country
which
filled
the
hearts
of
many
of
his
countrymen
he
often
intimated
the
possibility
of
an
insurrection
in
greece
but
we
had
no
idea
of
its
being
so
near
at
hand
when
on
the
of
april
he
called
on
shelley
bringing
the
proclamation
of
his
cousin
prince
ypsilanti
and
radiant
with
exultation
and
delight
declared
that
henceforth
greece
would
be
free
shelley
had
hymned
the
dawn
of
liberty
in
spain
and
naples
in
two
odes
dictated
by
the
warmest
enthusiasm
he
felt
himself
naturally
impelled
to
decorate
with
poetry
the
uprise
of
the
descendants
of
that
people
whose
works
he
regarded
with
deep
admiration
and
to
adopt
the
vaticinatory
character
in
prophesying
their
success
hellas
was
written
in
a
moment
of
enthusiasm
it
is
curious
to
remark
how
well
he
overcomes
the
difficulty
of
forming
a
drama
out
of
such
scant
materials
his
prophecies
indeed
came
true
in
their
general
not
their
particular
purport
he
did
not
foresee
the
death
of
lord
londonderry
which
was
to
be
the
epoch
of
a
change
in
english
politics
particularly
as
regarded
foreign
affairs
nor
that
the
navy
of
his
country
would
fight
for
instead
of
against
the
greeks
and
by
the
battle
of
navarino
secure
their
enfranchisement
from
the
turks
almost
against
reason
as
it
appeared
to
him
he
resolved
to
believe
that
greece
would
prove
triumphant
and
in
this
spirit
auguring
ultimate
good
yet
grieving
over
the
vicissitudes
to
be
endured
in
the
interval
he
composed
his
drama
hellas
was
among
the
last
of
his
compositions
and
is
among
the
most
beautiful
the
choruses
are
singularly
imaginative
and
melodious
in
their
versification
there
are
some
stanzas
that
beautifully
exemplify
shelley
peculiar
style
as
for
instance
the
assertion
of
the
intellectual
empire
which
must
be
for
ever
the
inheritance
of
the
country
of
homer
sophocles
and
plato
greece
and
her
foundations
are
built
below
the
tide
of
war
based
on
the
crystalline
sea
of
thought
and
its
eternity
and
again
that
philosophical
truth
felicitously
imaged
forth
and
wrong
bring
forth
their
kind
the
foul
cubs
like
their
parents
are
their
den
is
in
the
guilty
mind
and
conscience
feeds

your

the
echoes

a
voice
which
on
my
heart
sleeps

a
melody

early
days

as
you
said

he
was
so
awful

so
beautiful
in
mystery
and
terror
calming
me
as
the
loveliness
of

soothes

he
seemed
stormy
and
would
often
seem
a
quenchless
sun
masked
in
portentous
clouds
for
such
his
thoughts
and
even
his
actions
were
but
he
was
not
of
them
nor
they
of
him
but
as
they
hid
his
splendour
from
the
earth

said
he
was
a
man
of
blood
and
peril
and
steeped
in
bitter
infamy

should

solitude

all
the
ills
that
wait

be
sure
i
am
not

now
i
should
not
doubt
to
say
it
was
a
dream
methought
a
star
came
down
from
heaven
and
rested
mid
the
plants
of
india
which
i
had
given
a
shelter
from
the
frost
within
my
chamber
there
the
meteor
lay
panting
forth
light
among
the
leaves
and
flowers
as
if
it
lived
and
was
outworn
with
speed
or
that
it
loved
and
passion
made
the
pulse
of
its
bright
life
throb
like
an
anxious
heart
till
it
diffused
itself
and
all
the
chamber
and
walls
seemed
melted
into
emerald
fire
that
burned
not
in
the
midst
of
which
appeared
a
spirit
like
a
child
and
laughed
aloud
a
thrilling
peal
of
such
sweet
merriment
as
made
the
blood
tingle
in
my
warm
feet
then
bent
over
a
vase
and
murmuring
low
unintelligible
melodies
placed
something
in
the
mould
like
and
slowly
faded
and
in
place
of
it
a
soft
hand
issued
from
the
veil
of
fire
holding
a
cup
like
a
magnolia
flower
and
poured
upon
the
earth
within
the
vase
the
element
with
which
it
overflowed
brighter
than
morning
light
and
purer
than
the
water
of
the
springs
of
himalah
note
such
dream
omitted
indian
you
waked
not
lady
not
until
my
dream
became
like
a
child
legend
on
the
tideless
sand
which
the
first
foam
erases
half
and
half
leaves
legible
at
length
i
rose
and
went
visiting
my
flowers
from
pot
to
pot
and
thought
to
set
new
cuttings
in
the
empty
urns
and
when
i
came
to
that
beside
the
lattice
i
saw
two
little
leaves
lifting
the
light
mould
at
their
birth
and
then
i
my
forgotten
dream
and
day
by
day
green
as
a
gourd
in
june
the
plant
grew
fresh
and
thick
yet
no
one
knew
what
plant
it
was
its
stem
and
tendrils
seemed
like
emerald
snakes
mottled
and
diamonded
with
azure
mail
and
streaks
of
woven
silver
and
all
the
sheaths
that
folded
the
dark
buds
rose
like
the
crest
of
until
the
golden
eye
of
the
bright
flower
through
the
dark
lashes
of
those
veined
lids
disencumbered
of
their
silent
sleep
gazed
like
a
star
into
the
morning
light
its
leaves
were
delicate
you
almost
saw
the
pulses
with
which
the
purple
velvet
flower
was
fed
to
overflow
and
like
a
poet
heart
changing
bright
fancy
to
sweet
sentiment
changed
half
the
light
to
fragrance
it
soon
fell
and
to
a
green
and
dewy
left
all
its
treasured
beauty
day
by
day
i
nursed
the
plant
and
on
the
double
flute
played
to
it
on
the
sunny
winter
days
soft
melodies
as
sweet
as
april
rain
on
silent
leaves
and
sang
those
words
in
which
passion
makes
echo
taunt
the
sleeping
strings
and
i
would
send
tales
of
forgotten
love
late
into
the
lone
night
and
sing
wild
songs
of
maids
deserted
in
the
olden
time
and
weep
like
a
soft
cloud
in
april
bosom
upon
the
sleeping
eyelids
of
the
plant
so
that
perhaps
it
dreamed
that
spring
was
come
and
crept
abroad
into
the
moonlight
air
and
loosened
all
its
limbs
as
noon
by
noon
the
sun
averted
less
his
oblique
beam
indian
and
the
plant
died
not
in
the
frost
lady
it
grew
and
went
out
of
the
lattice
which
i
left
half
open
for
it
trailing
its
quaint
spires
along
the
garden
and
across
the
lawn
and
down
the
slope
of
moss
and
through
the
tufts
of
roots
and
stumps
of
trees
with
simple
lichens
and
old
hoary
stones
on
to
the
margin
of
the
glassy
pool
even
to
a
nook
of
unblown
violets
and
yet
unborn
under
a
pine
with
ivy
overgrown
and
theme
its
fruit
lay
like
a
sleeping
lizard
under
the
shadows
but
when
spring
indeed
came
to
unswathe
her
infants
and
the
lilies
peeped
from
their
bright
green
masks
to
wonder
at
this
shape
of
autumn
couched
in
their
recess
then
it
dilated
and
it
grew
until
one
half
lay
floating
on
the
fountain
wave
whose
pulse
elapsed
in
unlike
sympathies
kept
time
among
the
snowy
buds
its
shape
was
such
as
summer
melody
of
the
south
wind
in
spicy
vales
might
give
to
some
light
cloud
bound
from
the
golden
dawn
to
fairy
isles
of
evening
and
it
seemed
in
hue
and
form
that
it
had
been
a
mirror
of
all
the
hues
and
forms
around
it
and
upon
it
pictured
by
the
sunny
beams
which
from
the
bright
vibrations
of
the
pool
were
thrown
upon
the
rafters
and
the
roof
of
boughs
and
leaves
and
on
the
pillared
stems
of
the
dark
sylvan
temple
and
reflections
of
every
infant
flower
and
star
of
moss
and
veined
leaf
in
the
azure
odorous
air
and
thus
it
lay
in
the
elysian
calm
of
its
own
beauty
floating
on
the
line
which
like
a
film
in
purest
space
divided
the
heaven
beneath
the
water
from
the
heaven
above
the
clouds
and
every
day
i
went
watching
its
growth
and
wondering
and
as
the
day
grew
hot
methought
i
saw
a
glassy
vapour
dancing
on
the
pool
and
on
it
little
quaint
and
filmy
shapes
with
dizzy
motion

and
rise

as

should
be
let
loose
against

poor
argument
of

it
indeed
were

to
turn

at

swallowed
up

they
stand
us
in

touches

a

most
arithmetical

thence
you
infer
perhaps
the

now
if
a

should
call
his
dearest
enemies
sit
in
licensed
judgement
on

his

might
wisely
take
that
course
aside
to
cottington
it
is
enough
to
expect
from
these
lean
imposts
that
they
perform
the
office
of
a
scourge
without
more
profit
aloud
fines
and
confiscations
and
a
forced
loan
from
the
refractory
city

fill

love
of
loyal
gentlemen
and
noble
friends
for
the
worshipped
father
of
our
common
country
with
contributions
from
the
catholics
will
make

pale
in
our
excess
be
these
the
expedients
until

shall
frame
a

of

weak
expedients
they
have
we
not
drained
all
till

which
seemed
a

exhaustless

the
love
which
is
if
loyal
hearts
could
turn
their
blood
to
gold
laud
both
now
grow
barren

i
speak
it
not

looks
the

this

archy
gloriously
as
a
grave
covered
with
virgin
flowers
there
a
rainbow
in
the
sky
let
your

look
at
it
for
rainbow
in
the
morning
is
the
shepherd
warning
and
the
flocks
of
which
you
are
the
pastor
are
scattered
among
the
where
every
drop
of
water
is
a
flake
of
snow
and
the
breath
of
may
pierces
like
a
january
blast

the
sheep
have
mistaken
the
wolf
for

shepherd
my
poor
boy
and
the

the
wolves
for

queen
but
the
rainbow
was
a
good
sign
archy
it
says
that
the
waters
of
the
deluge
are
gone
and
can
return
no
more
archy
ay
the
one
but
that
of
tears
and
blood
must
yet
come
down
and
that
of
fire
follow
if
there
be
any
truth
in
the
rainbow
hung
over
the
city
with
all
its
shops
and
churches
from
north
to
south
like
a
bridge
of
congregated
lightning
pieced
by
the
masonry
of
heaven
like
a
balance
in
which
the
angel
that
distributes
the
coming
hour
was
weighing
that
heavy
one
whose
poise
is
now
felt
in
the
lightest
hearts
before
it
bows
the
proudest
heads
under
the
meanest
feet
queen
who
taught
you
this
trash
sirrah
archy
a
torn
leaf
out
of
an
old
book
trampled
in
the
but
for
the
rainbow
it
moved
as
the
sun
moved
and
until
the
top
of
the
tower
of
a
cloud
through
its
tip
and
lambeth
palace
look
as
dark
as
a
rock
before
the
other
methought
i
saw
a
crown
figured
upon
one
tip
and
a
mitre
on
the
other
so
as
i
had
heard
treasures
were
found
where
the
rainbow
quenches
its
points
upon
the
earth
i
set
off
and
at
the
tower
but
i
shall
not
tell
your
majesty
what
i
found
close
to
the
on
which
the
rainbow
had
glimmered
king
speak
i
will
make
my
fool
my
conscience
archy
then
conscience
is
a
i
saw
there
a
cat
caught
in
a
i
heard
the
rats
squeak
behind
the
wainscots
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
very
mice
were
consulting
on
the
manner
of
her
death
queen
archy
is
shrewd
and
bitter
archy
like
the
season
so
blow
the
but
at
the
other
end
of
the
rainbow
where
the
gray
rain
was
tempered
along
the
grass
and
leaves
by
a
tender
interfusion
of
violet
and
gold
in
the
meadows
beyond
lambeth
what
think
you
that
i
found
instead
of
a
mitre
king
vane
wits
perhaps
archy
something
as
vain
i
saw
a
gross
vapour
hovering
in
a
stinking
ditch
over
the
carcass
of
a
dead
ass
some
rotten
rags
and
broken
dishes
the
wrecks
of
what
once
administered
to
the
and
the
ornament
of
a
worm
of
worms
his
grace
of
canterbury
expects
to
enter
the
new
jerusalem
some
palm
sunday
in
triumph
on
the
ghost
of

my
beloved

have
you
not
noted
that
the
fool
of
late
has
lost
his
careless
mirth
and
that
his
words
sound
like
the
echoes
of
our
saddest
fears
what
can
it
mean
i
should
be
loth
to
think
some
factious
slave
had
tutored
him
king
oh
no
he
is
but
occasion
pupil
partly
is
that
our
minds
piece
the
vacant
intervals
of
his
wild
words
with
their
own
fashioning
as
in
the
imagery
of
summer
clouds
or
coals
of
the
winter
fire
idlers
find
the
perfect
shadows
of
their
teeming
thoughts

partly
that
the
terrors
of

are
sown
by
wandering

in
all

partly

your

let
us
go
try
these

from

as
we
pass
the

we
decide
where
that

hang

i
whom

had
kept
as
wakeful
as
the
stars
that
gem
the
cone
of
night
now
they
were
laid
asleep
stretched
my
faint
limbs
beneath
the
hoary
stem
which
an
old
chestnut
flung
athwart
the
steep
of
a
green
apennine
before
me
fled
the
night
behind
me
rose
the
day
the
deep
was
at
my
feet
and
heaven
above
my
head
when
a
strange
trance
over
my
fancy
grew
which
was
not
slumber
for
the
shade
it
spread
was
so
transparent
that
the
scene
came
through
as
clear
as
when
a
veil
of
light
is
drawn
evening
hills
they
glimmer
and
i
knew
that
i
had
felt
the
freshness
of
that
dawn
bathe
in
the
same
cold
dew
my
brow
and
hair
and
sate
as
thus
upon
that
slope
of
lawn
under
the
bough
and
heard
as
there
the
birds
the
fountains
and
the
ocean
hold
sweet
talk
in
music
through
the
enamoured
air
and
then
a
vision
on
my
train
was
rolled
as
in
that
trance
of
wondrous
thought
i
lay
this
was
the
tenour
of
my
waking
dream
methought
i
sate
beside
a
public
way
thick
strewn
with
summer
dust
and
a
great
stream
of
people
there
was
hurrying
to
and
fro
numerous
as
gnats
upon
the
evening
gleam
all
hastening
onward
yet
none
seemed
to
know
whither
he
went
or
whence
he
came
or
why
he
made
one
of
the
multitude
and
so
was
borne
amid
the
crowd
as
through
the
sky
one
of
the
million
leaves
of
summer
bier
old
age
and
youth
manhood
and
infancy
mixed
in
one
mighty
torrent
did
appear
some
flying
from
the
thing
they
feared
and
some
seeking
the
object
of
another
fear
and
others
as
with
steps
towards
the
tomb
pored
on
the
trodden
worms
that
crawled
beneath
and
others
mournfully
within
the
gloom
of
their
own
shadow
walked
and
called
it
death
and
some
fled
from
it
as
it
were
a
ghost
half
fainting
in
the
affliction
of
vain
breath
but
more
with
motions
which
each
other
crossed
pursued
or
shunned
the
shadows
the
clouds
threw
or
birds
within
the
noonday
aether
lost
upon
that
path
where
flowers
never
grew
and
weary
with
vain
toil
and
faint
for
thirst
heard
not
the
fountains
whose
melodious
dew
out
of
their
mossy
cells
forever
burst
nor
felt
the
breeze
which
from
the
forest
told
of
grassy
paths
and
interspersed
with
overarching
elms
and
caverns
cold
and
violet
banks
where
sweet
dreams
brood
but
they
pursued
their
serious
folly
as
of
old
and
as
i
gazed
methought
that
in
the
way
the
throng
grew
wilder
as
the
woods
of
june
when
the
south
wind
shakes
the
extinguished
day
and
a
cold
glare
intenser
than
the
noon
but
icy
cold
obscured
with
blinding
light
the
sun
as
he
the
stars
like
the
young
moon
when
on
the
sunlit
limits
of
the
night
her
white
shell
trembles
amid
crimson
air
and
whilst
the
sleeping
tempest
gathers
might
doth
as
the
herald
of
its
coming
bear
the
ghost
of
its
dead
mother
whose
dim
form
bends
in
dark
aether
from
her
infant
chair
so
came
a
chariot
on
the
silent
storm
of
its
own
rushing
splendour
and
a
shape
so
sate
within
as
one
whom
years
deform
beneath
a
dusky
hood
and
double
cape
crouching
within
the
shadow
of
a
tomb
and
what
seemed
the
head
a
crape
was
bent
a
dun
and
faint
aethereal
gloom
tempering
the
light
upon
the
a
shadow
did
assume
the
guidance
of
that
team
the
shapes
which
drew
it
in
thick
lightenings
were
lost
i
heard
alone
on
the
air
soft
stream
the
music
of
their
wings
all
the
four
faces
of
that
charioteer
had
their
eyes
banded
little
profit
brings
speed
in
the
van
and
blindness
in
the
rear
nor
then
avail
the
beams
that
quench
the
sun
or
that
with
banded
eyes
could
pierce
the
sphere
of
all
that
is
has
been
or
will
be
done
so
ill
was
the
car
guided
but
it
passed
with
solemn
speed
majestically
on
the
crowd
gave
way
and
i
arose
aghast
or
seemed
to
rise
so
mighty
was
the
trance
and
saw
like
clouds
upon
the
the
million
with
fierce
song
and
maniac
dance
raging
around
such
seemed
the
jubilee
as
when
to
greet
some
conqueror
advance
imperial
rome
poured
forth
her
living
sea
from
and
forum
and
theatre
when
upon
the
free
had
bound
a
yoke
which
soon
they
stooped
to
bear
nor
wanted
here
the
just
similitude
of
a
triumphal
pageant
for
the
chariot
rolled
a
captive
multitude
was
driven
all
those
who
had
grown
old
in
power
or
misery
all
who
had
their
age
subdued
by
action
or
by
suffering
and
whose
hour
was
drained
to
its
last
sand
in
weal
or
woe
so
that
the
trunk
survived
both
fruit
and
flower
all
those
whose
fame
or
infamy
must
grow
till
the
great
winter
lay
the
form
and
name
of
this
green
earth
with
them
for
ever
low
all
but
the
sacred
few
who
could
not
tame
their
spirits
to
the
conquerors
but
as
soon
as
they
had
touched
the
world
with
living
flame
fled
back
like
eagles
to
their
native
noon
or
those
who
put
aside
the
diadem
of
earthly
thrones
or
gems
were
there
of
athens
or
jerusalem
were
neither
mid
the
mighty
captives
seen
nor
mid
the
ribald
crowd
that
followed
them
nor
those
who
went
before
fierce
and
obscene

wild
dance
maddens
in
the
van
and
those
who
lead
it
fleet
as
shadows
on
the
green
outspeed
the
chariot
and
without
repose
mix
with
each
other
in
tempestuous
measure
to
savage
music
wilder
as
it
grows
they
tortured
by
their
agonizing
pleasure
convulsed
and
on
the
rapid
whirlwinds
spun
of
that
fierce
spirit
whose
unholy
leisure
was
soothed
by
mischief
since
the
world
begun
throw
back
their
heads
and
loose
their
streaming
hair
and
in
their
dance
round
her
who
dims
the
sun
maidens
and
youths
fling
their
wild
arms
in
air
as
their
feet
twinkle
they
recede
and
now
bending
within
each
other
atmosphere
kindle
invisibly
and
as
they
glow
like
moths
by
light
attracted
and
repelled
oft
to
their
bright
destruction
come
and
go
till
like
two
clouds
into
one
vale
impelled
that
shake
the
mountains
when
their
lightnings
mingle
and
die
in
rain
the
fiery
band
which
held
their
natures
snaps
while
the
shock
still
may
tingle
one
falls
and
then
another
in
the
path
senseless

is
the
desolation
single
yet
ere
i
can
say
where

as
of

behind

foully
disarrayed

hairs
in

wind

follow
in
the
dance
with
limbs
decayed
seeking
to
reach
the
light
which
leaves
them
still
farther
behind
and
deeper
in
the
shade
but
not
the
less
with
impotence
of
will
they
wheel
though
ghastly
shadows
interpose
round
them
and
round
each
other
and
fulfil
their
work
and
in
the
dust
from
whence
they
rose
sink
and
corruption
veils
them
as
they
lie
and
past
in
these
performs
what
in
those
struck
to
the
heart
by
this
sad
pageantry
half
to
myself
i
said
what
is
this
whose
shape
is
that
within
the
car
and
why
i
would
have
added
all
here
amiss
but
a
voice
answered
i
turned
and
knew
o
heaven
have
mercy
on
such
wretchedness
that
what
i
thought
was
an
old
root
which
grew
to
strange
distortion
out
of
the
hill
side
was
indeed
one
of
those
deluded
crew
and
that
the
grass
which
methought
hung
so
wide
and
white
was
but
his
thin
discoloured
hair
and
that
the
holes
he
vainly
sought
to
hide
were
or
had
been
eyes
thou
canst
forbear
to
join
the
dance
which
i
had
well
forborne
said
the
grim
feature
of
my
thought
aware
will
unfold
that
which
to
this
deep
scorn
led
me
and
my
companions
and
relate
the
progress
of
the
pageant
since
the
morn
thirst
of
knowledge
shall
not
then
abate
follow
it
thou
even
to
the
night
but
i
am
weary
then
like
one
who
with
the
weight
of
his
own
words
is
staggered
wearily
he
paused
and
ere
he
could
resume
i
cried
who
art
thou
thy
memory
feared
loved
hated
suffered
did
and
died
and
if
the
spark
with
which
heaven
lit
my
spirit
had
been
with
purer
nutriment
supplied
would
not
now
thus
much
inherit
of
what
was
once
rousseau
nor
this
disguise
stain
that
which
ought
to
have
disdained
to
wear
it
i
have
been
extinguished
yet
there
rise
a
thousand
beacons
from
the
spark
i
bore
who
are
those
chained
to
the
car
wise
great
the
unforgotten
they
who
wore
mitres
and
helms
and
crowns
or
wreaths
of
light
signs
of
thought
empire
over
thought
their
lore
them
not
this
to
know
themselves
their
might
could
not
repress
the
mystery
within
and
for
the
morn
of
truth
they
feigned
deep
night
them
ere
evening
is
he
with
chin
upon
his
breast
and
hands
crossed
on
his
chain
child
of
a
fierce
hour
he
sought
to
win
world
and
lost
all
that
it
did
contain
of
greatness
in
its
hope
destroyed
and
more
of
fame
and
peace
than
virtue
self
can
gain
the
opportunity
which
bore
him
on
its
eagle
pinions
to
the
peak
from
which
a
thousand
climbers
have
before
as
napoleon
fell
i
felt
my
cheek
alter
to
see
the
shadow
pass
away
whose
grasp
had
left
the
giant
world
so
weak
that
every
pigmy
kicked
it
as
it
lay
and
much
i
grieved
to
think
how
power
and
will
in
opposition
rule
our
mortal
day
and
why
god
made
irreconcilable
good
and
the
means
of
good
and
for
despair
i
half
disdained
mine
eyes
desire
to
fill
with
the
spent
vision
of
the
times
that
were
and
scarce
have
ceased
to
thou
behold
said
my

spoilers
spoiled
voltaire

paul

which
the

thinks
always
old
in
the
battle
life
and
they
did
wage
she
remained
conqueror
i
was
overcome
by
my
own
heart
alone
which
neither

nor
now
the

could
temper
to
its
object
them
pass
i
cried

its
mysterious
doom
not
so
much
more
glorious
than
it
was
that
i
desire
to
worship
those
who
drew
new
figures
on
its
false

the
old

the

paint
them
as

thrown
as
those

threw
shadows
on
it
as
it
passed
away
but
mark
how
chained
to
the
triumphal
chair
the
mighty
phantoms
of
an
elder
day
that
is
mortal
of
great
plato
there
expiates
the
joy
and
woe
his
master
knew
not
the
star
that
ruled
his
doom
was
far
too
fair

where
long
that
flower

by

or

could
subdue

the

dominion
followed
as

not

wake
and
lead
him
to
the
caves
that
held
the
treasure
of
the
secrets
of

see
the
great
bards
of
elder

who
quelled

which
they
sung
as
by
their
strain
may
well
be
known
their

tempers
its
own
contagion
to
the
vein
those
who
are
infected
with
it
i
have
suffered
what
i
wrote
or
viler
pain
and
so
my
words
have
seeds
of
misery
as
the

and
then
he
pointed
to
a
company
whom
i
quickly
recognized
the
heirs
of
caesar
crime
from
him
to
constantine
the
anarch
chiefs
whose
force
and
murderous
snares
had
founded
many
a

and
spread
the
plague
of
gold
and

abroad
and
gregory
and

men
divine
who
rose
like
shadows
between
man
and
god
till
that
eclipse
still
hanging
over
heaven
was
worshipped
by
the
world
which
they
strode
for
the
true
sun
it
quenched
power
was
given
but
to
destroy
replied
the
leader
am
one
of
those
who
have
created
even
it
be
but
a
world
of
agony
camest
thou
and
whither
goest
thou
how
did
thy
course
begin
i
said
why
eyes
are
sick
of
this
perpetual
flow
of
people
and
my
heart
sick
of
one
sad
thought
speak
i
am
i
partly
seem
to
know
how
and
by
what
paths
i
have
been
brought
to
this
dread
pass
methinks
even
thou
mayst
guess
why
this
should
be
my
mind
can
compass
not
the
conqueror
hurries
me
still
less
but
follow
thou
and
from
spectator
turn
actor
or
victim
in
this
wretchedness
what
thou
wouldst
be
taught
i
then
may
learn
from
thee
now
listen
in
the
april
prime
when
all
the
began
to
burn
kindling
green
touched
by
the
azure
clime
of
the
young
season
i
was
laid
asleep
under
a
mountain
which
from
unknown
time
yawned
into
a
cavern
high
and
deep
and
from
it
came
a
gentle
rivulet
whose
water
like
clear
air
in
its
calm
sweep
the
soft
grass
and
kept
for
ever
wet
the
stems
of
the
sweet
flowers
and
filled
the
grove
with
sounds
which
whoso
hears
must
needs
forget
pleasure
and
all
pain
all
hate
and
love
which
they
had
known
before
that
hour
of
rest
a
sleeping
mother
then
would
dream
not
of
only
child
who
died
upon
the
breast
at
eventide
a
king
would
mourn
no
more
the
crown
of
which
his
brows
were
dispossessed
the
sun
lingered
his
ocean
floor
to
gild
his
rival
new
prosperity
wouldst
forget
thus
vainly
to
deplore
which
if
ills
can
find
no
cure
from
thee
the
thought
of
which
no
other
sleep
will
quell
nor
other
music
blot
from
memory
sweet
and
deep
is
the
oblivious
spell
and
whether
life
had
been
before
that
sleep
the
heaven
which
i
imagine
or
a
hell
this
harsh
world
in
which
i
woke
to
weep
i
know
not
i
arose
and
for
a
space
the
scene
of
woods
and
waters
seemed
to
keep
though
it
was
now
broad
day
a
gentle
trace
of
light
diviner
than
the
common
sun
sheds
on
the
common
earth
and
all
the
place
filled
with
magic
sounds
woven
into
one
oblivious
melody
confusing
sense
amid
the
gliding
waves
and
shadows
dun
as
i
looked
the
bright
omnipresence
of
morning
through
the
orient
cavern
flowed
and
the
sun
image
radiantly
intense
on
the
waters
of
the
well
that
glowed
like
gold
and
threaded
all
the
forest
maze
with
winding
paths
of
emerald
fire
there
stood
the
sun
as
he
amid
the
blaze
of
his
own
glory
on
the
vibrating
floor
of
the
fountain
paved
with
flashing
rays
shape
all
light
which
with
one
hand
did
fling
dew
on
the
earth
as
if
she
were
the
dawn
and
the
invisible
rain
did
ever
sing
silver
music
on
the
mossy
lawn
and
still
before
me
on
the
dusky
grass
iris
her
scarf
had
drawn
her
right
hand
she
bore
a
crystal
glass
mantling
with
bright
nepenthe
the
fierce
splendour
fell
from
her
as
she
moved
under
the
mass
the
deep
cavern
and
with
palms
so
tender
their
tread
broke
not
the
mirror
of
its
billow
glided
along
the
river
and
did
bend
her
under
the
dark
boughs
till
like
a
willow
her
fair
hair
swept
the
bosom
of
the
stream
that
whispered
with
delight
to
be
its
pillow
one
enamoured
is
upborne
in
dream
lakes
mid
silver
mist
to
wondrous
music
so
this
shape
might
seem
to
tread
the
waves
with
feet
which
kissed
the
dancing
foam
partly
to
glide
along
the
air
which
roughened
the
moist
amethyst
the
faint
morning
beams
that
fell
among
the
trees
or
the
soft
shadows
of
the
trees
and
her
feet
ever
to
the
ceaseless
song
leaves
and
winds
and
waves
and
birds
and
bees
and
falling
drops
moved
in
a
measure
new
yet
sweet
as
on
the
summer
evening
breeze
from
the
lake
a
shape
of
golden
dew
between
two
rocks
athwart
the
rising
moon
dances
i
the
wind
where
never
eagle
flew
still
her
feet
no
less
than
the
sweet
tune
to
which
they
moved
seemed
as
they
moved
to
blot
the
thoughts
of
him
who
gazed
on
them
and
soon
that
was
seemed
as
if
it
had
been
not
and
all
the
gazer
mind
was
strewn
beneath
her
feet
like
embers
and
she
thought
by
thought
its
sparks
into
the
dust
of
death
as
day
upon
the
threshold
of
the
east
treads
out
the
lamps
of
night
until
the
breath
darkness
even
the
least
of
heaven
living
eyes
like
day
she
came
making
the
night
a
dream
and
ere
she
ceased
move
as
one
between
desire
and
shame
suspended
i
said
if
as
it
doth
seem
thou
comest
from
the
realm
without
a
name
this
valley
of
perpetual
dream
show
whence
i
came
and
where
i
am
and
why
pass
not
away
upon
the
passing
stream
and
quench
thy
thirst
was
her
reply
and
as
a
shut
lily
stricken
by
the
wand
of
dewy
morning
vital
alchemy
rose
and
bending
at
her
sweet
command
touched
with
faint
lips
the
cup
she
raised
and
suddenly
my
brain
became
as
sand
the
first
wave
had
more
than
half
erased
the
track
of
deer
on
desert
labrador
whilst
the
wolf
from
which
they
fled
amazed
his
stamp
visibly
upon
the
shore
until
the
second
bursts
so
on
my
sight
burst
a
new
vision
never
seen
before
the
fair
shape
waned
in
the
coming
light
as
veil
by
veil
the
silent
splendour
drops
from
lucifer
amid
the
chrysolite
sunrise
ere
it
tinge
the
and
as
the
presence
of
that
fairest
planet
although
unseen
is
felt
by
one
who
hopes
his
day
path
may
end
as
he
began
it
in
that
star
smile
whose
light
is
like
the
scent
of
a
jonquil
when
evening
breezes
fan
it
the
soft
note
in
which
his
dear
lament
the
brescian
shepherd
breathes
or
the
caress
that
turned
his
weary
slumber
to
content
knew
i
in
that
light
severe
excess
the
presence
of
that
shape
which
on
the
stream
moved
as
i
moved
along
the
wilderness
dimly
than
a
dream
the
host
of
a
forgotten
form
of
sleep
a
light
of
heaven
whose
beam
the
sick
day
in
which
we
wake
to
weep
glimmers
for
ever
sought
for
ever
lost
so
did
that
shape
its
obscure
tenour
keep
my
path
as
silent
as
a
ghost
but
the
new
vision
and
the
cold
bright
car
with
solemn
speed
and
stunning
music
crossed
forest
and
as
if
from
some
dread
war
triumphantly
returning
the
loud
million
fiercely
extolled
the
fortune
of
her
star
moving
arch
of
victory
the
vermilion
and
green
and
azure
plumes
of
iris
had
built
high
over
her
pavilion
underneath
aethereal
glory
clad
the
wilderness
and
far
before
her
flew
the
tempest
of
the
splendour
which
forbade
to
fall
from
leaf
and
stone
the
crew
seemed
in
that
light
like
atomies
to
dance
within
a
sunbeam
some
upon
the
new
of
flowers
that
did
enhance
the
grassy
vesture
of
the
desert
played
forgetful
of
the
chariot
swift
advance
stood
gazing
till
within
the
shade
of
the
great
mountain
its
light
left
them
dim
others
outspeeded
it
and
others
made
around
it
like
the
clouds
that
swim
round
the
high
moon
in
a
bright
sea
of
air
and
more
did
follow
with
exulting
hymn
chariot
and
the
captives
fettered
there
but
all
like
bubbles
on
an
eddying
flood
fell
into
the
same
track
at
last
and
were
i
among
the
multitude
was
swept
me
sweetest
flowers
delayed
not
long
me
not
the
shadow
nor
the
solitude
not
that
falling
stream
lethean
song
me
not
the
phantom
of
that
early
form
which
moved
upon
its
motion
but
among
thickest
billows
of
that
living
storm
i
plunged
and
bared
my
bosom
to
the
clime
of
that
cold
light
whose
airs
too
soon
deform
the
chariot
had
begun
to
climb
the
opposing
steep
of
that
mysterious
dell
behold
a
wonder
worthy
of
the
rhyme
him
who
from
the
lowest
depths
of
hell
through
every
paradise
and
through
all
glory
love
led
serene
and
who
returned
to
tell
words
of
hate
and
awe
the
wondrous
story
how
all
things
are
transfigured
except
love
for
deaf
as
is
a
sea
which
wrath
makes
hoary
world
can
hear
not
the
sweet
notes
that
move
the
sphere
whose
light
is
melody
to
lovers
a
wonder
worthy
of
his
the
grove
dense
with
shadows
to
its
inmost
covers
the
earth
was
gray
with
phantoms
and
the
air
was
peopled
with
dim
forms
as
when
there
hovers
flock
of
before
the
glare
of
the
tropic
sun
bringing
ere
evening
strange
night
upon
some
indian
isle
thus
were
diffused
around
and
some
did
fling
shadows
of
shadows
yet
unlike
themselves
behind
them
some
like
eaglets
on
the
wing
lost
in
the
white
day
others
like
elves
danced
in
a
thousand
unimagined
shapes
upon
the
sunny
streams
and
grassy
shelves
others
sate
chattering
like
restless
apes
on
vulgar
hands
some
made
a
cradle
of
the
ermined
capes
kingly
mantles
some
across
the
tiar
of
pontiffs
sate
like
vultures
others
played
under
the
crown
which
girt
with
empire
baby
or
an
idiot
brow
and
made
their
nests
in
it
the
old
anatomies
sate
hatching
their
bare
broods
under
the
shade
daemon
wings
and
laughed
from
their
dead
eyes
to
reassume
the
delegated
power
arrayed
in
which
those
worms
did
monarchize
made
this
earth
their
charnel
others
more
humble
like
falcons
sate
upon
the
fist
of
common
men
and
round
their
heads
did
soar
or
like
small
gnats
and
flies
as
thick
as
mist
on
evening
marshes
thronged
about
the
brow
of
lawyers
statesmen
priest
and
theorist
others
like
discoloured
flakes
of
snow
on
fairest
bosoms
and
the
sunniest
hair
fell
and
were
melted
by
the
youthful
glow
they
extinguished
and
like
tears
they
were
a
veil
to
those
from
whose
faint
lids
they
rained
in
drops
of
sorrow
i
became
aware
whence
those
forms
proceeded
which
thus
stained
the
track
in
which
we
moved
after
brief
space
from
every
form
the
beauty
slowly
waned
every
firmest
limb
and
fairest
face
the
strength
and
freshness
fell
like
dust
and
left
the
action
and
the
shape
without
the
grace
life
the
marble
brow
of
youth

will

some
of
the

ones
for
as
i
have
said
many
of
these
were
thrown
aside
and
i
never
saw
them
till
i
had
the
misery
of
looking
over
his
writings
after
the
hand
that
traced
them
was
dust
and
some
were
in
the
hands
of
others
and
i
never
saw
them
till
now
the
subjects
of
the
poems
are
often
to
me
an
unerring
guide
but
on
other
occasions
i
can
only
guess
by
finding
them
in
the
pages
of
the
same
manuscript
book
that
contains
poems
with
the
date
of
whose
composition
i
am
fully
conversant
in
the
present
arrangement
all
his
poetical
translations
will
be
placed
together
at
the
end
the
loss
of
his
early
papers
prevents
my
being
able
to
give
any
of
the
poetry
of
his
boyhood
of
the
few
i
give
as
early
poems
the
greater
part
were
published
with
alastor
some
of
them
were
written
previously
some
at
the
same
period
the
poem
beginning
there
are
spirits
in
the
air
was
addressed
in
idea
to
coleridge
whom
he
never
knew
and
at
whose
character
he
could
only
guess
imperfectly
through
his
writings
and
accounts
he
heard
of
him
from
some
who
knew
him
well
he
regarded
his
change
of
opinions
as
rather
an
act
of
will
than
conviction
and
believed
that
in
his
inner
heart
he
would
be
haunted
by
what
shelley
considered
the
better
and
holier
aspirations
of
his
youth
the
summer
evening
that
suggested
to
him
the
poem
written
in
the
churchyard
of
lechlade
occurred
during
his
voyage
up
the
thames
in
he
had
been
advised
by
a
physician
to
live
as
much
as
possible
in
the
open
air
and
a
fortnight
of
a
bright
warm
july
was
spent
in
tracing
the
thames
to
its
source
he
never
spent
a
season
more
tranquilly
than
the
summer
of
he
had
just
recovered
from
a
severe
pulmonary
attack
the
weather
was
warm
and
pleasant
he
lived
near
windsor
forest
and
his
life
was
spent
under
its
shades
or
on
the
water
meditating
subjects
for
verse
hitherto
he
had
chiefly
aimed
at
extending
his
political
doctrines
and
attempted
so
to
do
by
appeals
in
prose
essays
to
the
people
exhorting
them
to
claim
their
rights
but
he
had
now
begun
to
feel
that
the
time
for
action
was
not
ripe
in
england
and
that
the
pen
was
the
only
instrument
wherewith
to
prepare
the
way
for
better
things
in
the
scanty
journals
kept
during
those
years
i
find
a
record
of
the
books
that
shelley
read
during
several
years

walked
along

of
a

to

a
hoar
wood
shadowed

to

was
open

when
the
morning
came
the

her

springs
the

its
tribute
brings
of
waters
with
a
sound
but
half
its
own
such
as
a
feeble
brook
will
oft
assume
in
the
wild
woods
among
the
mountains
lone
where
waterfalls
around
it
leap
for
ever
where
woods
and
winds
contend
and
a
vast
river
over
its
rocks
ceaselessly
bursts
and
raves
thus
thou
ravine
of
arve
dark
deep
ravine
thou
vale
over
whose
pines
and
crags
and
caverns
sail
fast
and
sunbeams
awful
scene
where
power
in
likeness
of
the
arve
comes
down
from
the
that
gird
his
secret
throne
bursting
through
these
dark
mountains
like
the
flame
of
lightning
through
the
tempest
thou
dost
lie
thy
giant
brood
of
pines
around
thee
clinging
children
of
elder
time
in
whose
devotion
the
chainless
winds
still
come
and
ever
came
to
drink
their
odours
and
their
mighty
swinging
to
hear
an
old
and
solemn
harmony
thine
earthly
rainbows
stretched
across
the
sweep
of
the
ethereal
waterfall
whose
veil
robes
some
unsculptured
image
the
strange
sleep
which
when
the
voices
of
the
desert
fail
wraps
all
in
its

deep
eternity
thy
caverns
echoing
to
the

a

no

sound
can
tame
thou
art
pervaded
with
that
ceaseless

thou
art
the

that
unresting
sound
dizzy
ravine
and
when
i
gaze
on
thee
i
seem
as
in
a
trance
sublime
and
strange
to
muse
on
my
own
separate
fantasy
my
own
my
human
mind
which
passively
now
renders
and
receives
fast
influencings
holding
an
unremitting
interchange
with
the
clear
universe
of
things
around
one
legion
of
wild
thoughts
whose
wandering
wings
now
float
above
thy
darkness
and
now
rest
where
that
or
thou
art
no
unbidden
guest
in
the
still
cave
of
the
witch
poesy
seeking
among
the
shadows
that
pass
by
ghosts
of
all
things
that
are
some
shade
of
thee
some
phantom
some
faint
image
till
the
breast
from
which
they
fled
recalls
them
thou
art
there
some
say
that
gleams
of
a
remoter
world
visit
the
soul
in
sleep
that
death
is
slumber
and
that
its
shapes
the
busy
thoughts
outnumber
of
those
who
wake
and
i
look
on
high
has
some
unknown
omnipotence
unfurled
the

i
lie
in

and
does
the
mightier
world
of
sleep
spread
far
around

inaccessibly
its
circles
for
the

note
on
poems
of
by
shelley
shelley
wrote
little
during
this
year
the
poem
entitled
the
sunset
was
written
in
the
spring
of
the
year
while
still
residing
at
bishopsgate
he
spent
the
summer
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
of
geneva
the
hymn
to
intellectual
beauty
was
conceived
during
his
voyage
round
the
lake
with
lord
byron
he
occupied
himself
during
this
voyage
by
reading
the
nouvelle
heloise
for
the
first
time
the
reading
it
on
the
very
spot
where
the
scenes
are
laid
added
to
the
interest
and
he
was
at
once
surprised
and
charmed
by
the
passionate
eloquence
and
earnest
enthralling
interest
that
pervade
this
work
there
was
something
in
the
character
of
in
his
abnegation
of
self
and
in
the
worship
he
paid
to
love
that
coincided
with
shelley
own
disposition
and
though
differing
in
many
of
the
views
and
shocked
by
others
yet
the
effect
of
the
whole
was
fascinating
and
delightful
mont
blanc
was
inspired
by
a
view
of
that
mountain
and
its
surrounding
peaks
and
valleys
as
he
lingered
on
the
bridge
of
arve
on
his
way
through
the
valley
of
chamouni
shelley
makes
the
following
mention
of
this
poem
in
his
publication
of
the
history
of
a
six
tour
and
letters
from
switzerland
poem
entitled
mont
blanc
is
written
by
the
author
of
the
two
letters
from
chamouni
and
vevai
it
was
composed
under
the
immediate
impression
of
the
deep
and
powerful
feelings
excited
by
the
objects
which
it
attempts
to
describe
and
as
an
undisciplined
overflowing
of
the
soul
rests
its
claim
to
approbation
on
an
attempt
to
imitate
the
untamable
wildness
and
inaccessible
solemnity
from
which
those
feelings
sprang
this
was
an
eventful
year
and
less
time
was
given
to
study
than
usual
in
the
list
of
his

regarded
them

a
pale
dream
came
to
a
lady
fair
and
said
a
boon
a
boon
i
pray
i
know
the
secrets
of
the
air
and
things
are
lost
in
the
glare
of
day
which
i
can
make
the
sleeping
see
if
they
will
put
their
trust
in
me
and
thou
shalt
know
of
things
unknown
if
thou
wilt
let
me
rest
between
the
veiny
lids
whose
fringe
is
thrown
over
thine
eyes
so
dark
and
sheen
and
half
in
hope
and
half
in
fright
the
lady
closed
her
eyes
so
bright
at
first
all
deadly
shapes
were
driven
tumultuously
across
her
sleep
and
the
vast
cope
of
bending
heaven
all
clouds
did
sweep
and
the
lady
ever
looked
to
spy
if
the
golden
sun
shone
forth
on
high
and
as
towards
the
east
she
turned
she
saw
aloft
in
the
morning
air
which
now
with
hues
of
sunrise
burned
a
great
black
anchor
rising
there
and
wherever
the
lady
turned
her
eyes
it
hung
before
her
in
the
skies
the
sky
was
blue
as
the
summer
sea
the
depths
were
cloudless
overhead
the
air
was
calm
as
it
could
be
there
was
no
sight
or
sound
of
dread
but
that
black
anchor
floating
still
over
the
piny
eastern
hill
the
lady
grew
sick
with
a
weight
of
fear
to
see
that
anchor
ever
hanging
and
veiled
her
eyes
she
then
did
hear
the
sound
as
of
a
dim
low
clanging
and
looked
abroad
if
she
might
know
was
it
aught
else
or
but
the
flow
of
the
blood
in
her
own
veins
to
and
fro
there
was
a
mist
in
the
sunless
air
which
shook
as
it
were
with
an
earthquake
shock
but
the
very
weeds
that
blossomed
there
were
moveless
and
each
mighty
rock
stood
on
its
basis
steadfastly
the
anchor
was
seen
no
more
on
high
but
piled
around
with
summits
hid
in
lines
of
cloud
at
intervals
stood
many
a
mountain
pyramid
among
whose
everlasting
walls
two
mighty
cities
shone
and
ever
through
the
red
mist
their
domes
did
quiver
on
two
dread
mountains
from
whose
crest
might
seem
the
eagle
for
her
brood
would
have
hung
her
dizzy
nest
those
cities
stood
a
vision
strange
such
towers
to
see
sculptured
and
wrought
so
gorgeously
where
human
art
could
never
be
and
columns
framed
of
marble
white
and
giant
fanes
dome
over
dome
piled
and
triumphant
gates
all
bright
with
workmanship
which
could
not
come
from
touch
of
mortal
instrument
shot
the
vales
or
lustre
lent
from
its
own
shapes
magnificent
but
still
the
lady
heard
that
clang
filling
the
wide
air
far
away
and
still
the
mist
whose
light
did
hang
among
the
mountains
shook
alway
so
that
the
lady
heart
beat
fast
as
half
in
joy
and
half
aghast
on
those
high
domes
her
look
she
cast
sudden
from
out
that
city
sprung
a
light
that
made
the
earth
grow
red
two
flames
that
each
with
quivering
tongue
licked
its
high
domes
and
overhead
among
those
mighty
towers
and
fanes
dropped
fire
as
a
volcano
rains
its
sulphurous
ruin
on
the
plains
and
hark
a
rush
as
if
the
deep
had
burst
its
bonds
she
looked
behind
and
saw
over
the
western
steep
a
raging
flood
descend
and
wind
through
that
wide
vale
she
felt
no
fear
but
said
within
herself
is
clear
these
towers
are
nature
own
and
she
to
save
them
has
sent
forth
the
sea
and
now
those
raging
billows
came
where
that
fair
lady
sate
and
she
was
borne
towards
the
showering
flame
by
the
wild
waves
heaped
tumultuously
and
on
a
little
plank
the
flow
of
the
whirlpool
bore
her
to
and
fro
the
flames
were
fiercely
vomited
from
every
tower
and
every
dome
and
dreary
light
did
widely
shed
that
vast
flood
suspended
foam
beneath
the
smoke
which
hung
its
night
on
the
stained
cope
of
heaven
light
the
plank
whereon
that
lady
sate
was
driven
through
the
chasms
about
and
about
between
the
peaks
so
desolate
of
the
drowning
mountains
in
and
out
as
the
on
a
whirlwind
sails
while
the
flood
was
filling
those
hollow
vales
at
last
her
plank
an
eddy
crossed
and
bore
her
to
the
city
wall
which
now
the
flood
had
reached
almost
it
might
the
stoutest
heart
appal
to
hear
the
fire
roar
and
hiss
through
the
domes
of
those
mighty
palaces
the
eddy
whirled
her
round
and
round
before
a
gorgeous
gate
which
stood
piercing
the
clouds
of
smoke
which
bound
its
aery
arch
with
light
like
blood
she
looked
on
that
gate
of
marble
clear
with
wonder
that
extinguished
fear
for
it
was
filled
with
sculptures
rarest
of
forms
most
beautiful
and
strange
like
nothing
human
but
the
fairest
of
winged
shapes
whose
legions
range
throughout
the
sleep
of
those
that
are
like
this
same
lady
good
and
fair
and
as
she
looked
still
lovelier
grew
those
marble
forms
the
sculptor
sure
was
a
strong
spirit
and
the
hue
of
his
own
mind
did
there
endure
after
the
touch
whose
power
had
braided
such
grace
was
in
some
sad
change
faded
she
looked
the
flames
were
dim
the
flood
grew
tranquil
as
a
woodland
river
winding
through
hills
in
solitude
those
marble
shapes
then
seemed
to
quiver
and
their
fair
limbs
to
float
in
motion
like
weeds
unfolding
in
the
ocean
and
their
lips
moved
one
seemed
to
speak
when
suddenly
the
mountains
cracked
and
through
the
chasm
the
flood
did
break
with
an
cataract
the
statues
gave
a
joyous
scream
and
on
its
wings
the
pale
thin
dream
lifted
the
lady
from
the
stream
the
dizzy
flight
of
that
phantom
pale
waked
the
fair
lady
from
her
sleep
and
she
arose
while
from
the
veil
of
her
dark
eyes
the
dream
did
creep
and
she
walked
about
as
one
who
knew
that
sleep

many
a
stray
idea

transitory
emotion
found
imperfect

and
then
again
lost
themselves
in
silence
as
he
never

without
a
book
and
without
implements
of
writing
i
find
many
such
in

that
scarcely
bear

broken

they
are

the

queen

the
production
of
his
contemporaries
coleridge
wordsworth
moore
and

his
life
was
now
spent
more
in
thought
than
action
he
had
lost
the
eager
spirit
which
believed
it
could
achieve
what
it
projected
for
the
benefit
of
mankind
and
yet
in
the
converse
of
daily
life
shelley
was
far
from
being
a
melancholy
man
he
was
eloquent
when
philosophy
or
politics
or
taste
were
the
subjects
of
conversation
he
was
playful
and
indulged
in
the
wild
spirit
that
mocked
itself
and
others
not
in
bitterness
but
in
sport
the
author
of
nightmare
abbey
seized
on
some
points
of
his
character
and
some
habits
of
his
life
when
he
painted
scythrop
he
was
not
addicted
to
or
madeira
but
in
youth
he
had
read
of
and
eleutherarchs
and
believed
that
he
possessed
the
power
of
operating
an
immediate
change
in
the
minds
of
men
and
the
state
of
society
these
wild
dreams
had
faded
sorrow
and
adversity
had
struck
home
but
he
struggled
with
despondency
as
he
did
with
physical
pain
there
are
few
who
remember
him
sailing
paper
boats
and
watching
the
navigation
of
his
tiny
craft
with
eagerness
or
repeating
with
wild
energy
the
ancient
mariner
and
southey
old
woman
of
berkeley
but
those
who
do
will
recollect
that
it
was
in
such
and
in
the
creations
of
his
own
fancy
when
that
was
most
daring
and
ideal
that
he
sheltered
himself
from
the
storms
and
disappointments
the
pain
and
sorrow
that
beset
his
life
no
words
can
express
the
anguish
he
felt
when
his
elder
children
were
torn
from
him
in
his
first
resentment
against
the
chancellor
on
the
passing
of
the
decree
he
had
written
a
curse
in
which
there
breathes
besides
haughty
indignation
all
the
tenderness
of
a
father
love
which
could
imagine
and
fondly
dwell
upon
its
loss
and
the
consequences
at
one
time
while
the
question
was
still
pending
the
chancellor
had
said
some
words
that
seemed
to
intimate
that
shelley
should
not
be
permitted
the
care
of
any
of
his
children
and
for
a
moment
he
feared
that
our
infant
son
would
be
torn
from
us
he
did
not
hesitate
to
resolve
if
such
were
menaced
to
abandon
country
fortune
everything
and
to
escape
with
his
child
and
i
find
some
unfinished
stanzas
addressed
to
this
son
whom
afterwards
we
lost
at
rome
written
under
the
idea
that
we
might
suddenly
be
forced
to
cross
the
sea

well
as
the
one
previously
quoted
were
not
written
to
exhibit
the
pangs
of
distress
to
the
public
they
were
the
spontaneous
outbursts
of
a
man
who
brooded
over
his
wrongs
and
woes
and
was
impelled
to
shed
the
grace
of
his
genius
over
the
uncontrollable
emotions
of
his
heart

to
the
paean
with
which
the
legioned
rooks
did
hail
the
sun
uprise
majestical
gathering
round
with
wings
all
hoar
through
the
dewy
mist
they
soar
like
gray
shades
till
the
eastern
heaven
bursts
and
then
as
clouds
of
even
flecked
with
fire
and
azure
lie
in
the
unfathomable
sky
so
their
plumes
of
purple
grain
starred
with
drops
of
golden
rain
gleam
above
the
sunlight
woods
as
in
silent
multitudes
on
the
morning
fitful
gale
through
the
broken
mist
they
sail
and
the
vapours
cloven
and
gleaming
follow
down
the
dark
steep
streaming
till
all
is
bright
and
clear
and
still
round
the
solitary
hill
beneath
is
spread
like
a
green
sea
the
waveless
plain
of
lombardy
bounded
by
the
vaporous

blue
and
beaming
waves

the
sun
upsprings
behind
broad
red
radiant
on
the
level
quivering
line
of
the
waters
crystalline
and
before
that
chasm
of
light
as
within
a
furnace
bright
column
tower
and
dome
and
spire
shine
like
obelisks
of
fire
pointing
with
inconstant
motion
from
the
altar
of
dark
ocean
to
the
skies
as
the
flames
of
sacrifice
from
the
marble
shrines
did
rise
as
to
pierce
the
dome
of
gold
where
apollo
spoke
of
old
city
thou
hast
been
ocean
child
and
then
his
queen
now
is
come
a
darker
day
and
thou
soon
must
be
his
prey
if
the
power
that
raised
thee
here
hallow
so
thy
watery
bier
a
less
drear
ruin
then
than
now
with
thy
brow
stooping
to
the
slave
of
slaves
from
thy
throne
among
the
waves
wilt
thou
be
when
the
flies
as
once
before
it
flew
thine
isles
depopulate
and
all
is
in
its
ancient
state
save
where
many
a
palace
gate
with
green
overgrown
like
a
rock
of

own
topples
the
abandoned
sea
as
the
tides
change
sullenly
the
fisher
on
his
watery
way
wandering
at
the
close
of
day
will
spread
his
sail
and
seize
his
oar
till
he
pass
the
gloomy
shore
lest
thy
dead
should
from
their
sleep
bursting
the
starlight
deep
lead
a
rapid
masque
of
death
the
waters
of
his
path
those
who
alone
thy
towers
behold
quivering
through
aereal
gold
as
i
now
behold
them
here
would
imagine
not
they
were
sepulchres
where
human
forms
like
worms
to
the
corpse
of
greatness
cling
murdered
and
now
mouldering

if
freedom
should
awake
in
her
omnipotence
and
shake
from
the
celtic

all
the

of
dungeons
cold
where
a
hundred

the

immortally
one
remembrance
more
sublime
than
the
tattered
pall

thy
visage
wan
that
a
swan
of
the
songs
of
albion
driven
from
his
ancestral
streams
by
the
might
of
evil
dreams
found
a
nest
in
thee
and
ocean
welcomed
him
with
such
emotion
that
its
joy
grew
his
and
sprung
from
his
lips
like
music
flung
a
mighty
chastening
terror
what

poesy
unfailing
river
which
through
albion
winds
forever
lashing
with

many

the

chequering
the

of

with
jagged

from

albert
marenghi
was
a
florentine
if
he
had
wealth
or

or

or

or
cherished
thoughts
which
twine
the
sights
and
sounds
of
home
with
life
own
life
of
these
he
was
despoiled
and
florence
sent
no
record
of
his
crime
remains
in
story
but
if
the
morning
bright
as
evening
shone
it
was
some
high
and
holy
deed
by
glory
pursued
into
forgetfulness
which
won
from
the
blind
crowd
he
made
secure
and
free
the
patriot
meed
toil
death
and
infamy
for
when
by
sound
of
trumpet
was
declared
a
price
upon
his
life
and
there
was
set
a
penalty
of
blood
on
all
who
shared
so
much
of
water
with
him
as
might
wet
his
lips
which
speech
divided
not
he
went
alone
as
you
may
guess
to
banishment
amid
the
mountains
like
a
hunted
beast
he
hid
himself
and
hunger
toil
and
cold
month
after
month
endured
it
was
a
feast
he
found
those
globes
of
gold
which
in
the
woods
the
doth
bear
suspended
in
their
emerald
atmosphere
and
in
the
roofless
huts
of
vast
morasses
deserted
by
the
serf
all
overgrown
with
reeds
and
long
rank
grasses
and
hillocks
heaped
of
turf
and
where
the
huge
and
speckled
aloe
made
rooted
in
stones
a
broad
and
pointed
shade
he
housed
himself

the
treacherous

divides
it
from

land
shadowed
by

wide
and
on

other
creeps
eternally
through
muddy
weeds
the
shallow
sullen
sea
here
the
earth
breath
is
pestilence
and
few
but
things
whose
nature
is
at

makes
his
dungeon
more

cope

his
oppressor
warring
with
decay
or
he
could
have
lived
years
day

nor
was
his
state
so
lone
as
you
might
think
he
had
tamed
every
newt
and
snake
and
toad
and
every
seagull
which
sailed
down
to
drink
those
freshes
ere
the
went
abroad
and
each
one
with
peculiar
talk
and
play
wiled
not
untaught
his
silent
time
away
and
the
like
tame
beasts
at
night
came
licking
with
blue
tongues
his
veined
feet
and
he
would
watch
them
as
like
spirits
bright
in
many
entangled
figures
quaint
and
sweet
to
some
enchanted
music
they
would
dance
until
they
vanished
at
the
first
he
mocked
the
stars
by
grouping
on
each
weed
the
summer
in
the
golden
dawn
and
ere
the
languished
he
could
read
its
pictured
path
as
on
bare
spots
of
lawn
its
delicate
brief
touch
in
silver
weaves
the
likeness
of
the
wood
remembered
leaves
and
many
a
fresh
spring
morn
would
he
awaken
while
yet
the
unrisen
sun
made
glow
like
iron
quivering
in
crimson
fire
the
peaks
unshaken
of
mountains
and
blue
isles
which
did
environ
with
crags
that
plain
of
land
and
sea
and
feel
liberty
and
in
the
moonless
nights
when
the
dun
ocean
heaved
underneath
wide
heaven
starting
from
dreams
communed
with
the
immeasurable
world
and
felt
his
life
beyond
his
limbs
dilated
till
his
mind
grew
like
that
it
contemplated
his
food
was
the
wild
fig
and
strawberry
the
milky
which
the
shakes
into
the
tall
grass
or
such
small
fry
as
from
the
sea
by
are
cast
and
the
coarse
bulbs
of
he
found
knotted
in
clumps
under
the
spongy
ground
and
so
were
kindled
powers
and
thoughts
which
made
his
solitude
less
dark
when
memory
came
for
years
gone
by
leave
each
a
deepening
shade
his
spirit
basked
in
its
internal

note
on
poems
of
by
shelley
we
often
hear
of
persons
disappointed
by
a
first
visit
to
italy
this
was
not
shelley
case
the
aspect
of
its
nature
its
sunny
sky
its
majestic
storms
of
the
luxuriant
vegetation
of
the
country
and
the
noble
cities
enchanted
him
the
sight
of
the
works
of
art
was
full
enjoyment
and
wonder
he
had
not
studied
pictures
or
statues
before
he
now
did
so
with
the
eye
of
taste
that
referred
not
to
the
rules
of
schools
but
to
those
of
nature
and
truth
the
first
entrance
to
rome
opened
to
him
a
scene
of
remains
of
antique
grandeur
that
far
surpassed
his
expectations
and
the
unspeakable
beauty
of
naples
and
its
environs
added
to
the
impression
he
received
of
the
transcendent
and
glorious
beauty
of
italy
our
winter
was
spent
at
naples
here
he
wrote
the
fragments
of
marenghi
and
the
woodman
and
the
nightingale
which
he
afterwards
threw
aside
at
this
time
shelley
suffered
greatly
in
health
he
put
himself
under
the
care
of
a
medical
man
who
promised
great
things
and
made
him
endure
severe
bodily
pain
without
any
good
results
constant
and
poignant
physical
suffering
exhausted
him
and
though
he
preserved
the
appearance
of
cheerfulness
and
often
greatly
enjoyed
our
wanderings
in
the
environs
of
naples
and
our
excursions
on
its
sunny
sea
yet
many
hours
were
passed
when
his
thoughts
shadowed
by
illness
became
gloomy
and
then
he
escaped
to
solitude
and
in
verses
which
he
hid
from
fear
of
wounding
me
poured
forth
morbid
but
too
natural
bursts
of
discontent
and
sadness
one
looks
back
with
unspeakable
regret
and
gnawing
remorse
to
such
periods
fancying
that
had
one
been
more
alive
to
the
nature
of
his
feelings
and
more
attentive
to
soothe
them
such
would
not
have
existed
and
yet
enjoying
as
he
appeared
to
do
every
sight
or
influence
of
earth
or
sky
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
that
any
melancholy
he
showed
was
aught
but
the
effect
of
the
constant
pain
to
which
he
was
a
martyr
we
lived
in
utter
solitude
and
such
is
often
not
the
nurse
of
cheerfulness
for
then
at
least
with
those
who
have
been
exposed
to
adversity
the
mind
broods
over
its
sorrows
too
intently
while
the
society
of
the
enlightened
the
witty
and
the
wise
enables
us
to
forget
ourselves
by
making
us
the
sharers
of
the
thoughts
of
others
which
is
a
portion
of
the
philosophy
of
happiness
shelley
never
liked
society
in
numbers
it
harassed
and
wearied
him
but
neither
did
he
like
loneliness
and
usually
when
alone
sheltered
himself
against
memory
and
reflection
in
a
book
but
with
one
or
two
whom
he
loved
he
gave
way
to
wild
and
joyous
spirits
or
in
more
serious
conversation
expounded
his
opinions
with
vivacity
and
eloquence
if
an
argument
arose
no
man
ever
argued
better
he
was
clear
logical
and
earnest
in
supporting
his
own
views
attentive
patient
and
impartial
while
listening
to
those
on
the
adverse
side
had
not
a
wall
of
prejudice
been
raised
at
this
time
between
him
and
his
countrymen
how
many
would
have
sought
the
acquaintance
of
one
whom
to
know
was
to
love
and
to
revere
how
many
of
the
more
enlightened
of
his
contemporaries
have
since
regretted
that
they
did
not
seek
him
how
very
few
knew
his
worth
while
he
lived
and
of
those
few
several
were
withheld
by
timidity
or
envy
from
declaring
their
sense
of
it
but
no
man
was
ever
more
enthusiastically
loved
more
looked
up
to
as
one
superior
to
his
fellows
in
intellectual
endowments
and
moral
worth
by
the
few
who
knew
him
well
and
had
sufficient
nobleness
of
soul
to
appreciate
his
superiority
his
excellence
is
now
acknowledged
but
even
while
admitted
not
duly
appreciated
for
who
except
those
who
were
acquainted
with
him
can
imagine
his
unwearied
benevolence
his
generosity
his
systematic
forbearance
and
still
less
is
his
vast
superiority
in
intellectual
attainments
sufficiently
understood
his
sagacity
his
clear
understanding
his
learning
his
prodigious
memory
all
these
as
displayed
in
conversation
were
known
to
few
while
he
lived
and
are
now
silent

shelley
loved
the
people
and
respected
them
as
often
more
virtuous
as
always
more
suffering
and
therefore
more
deserving
of
sympathy
than
the
great
he
believed
that
a
clash
between
the
two
classes
of
society
was
inevitable
and
he
eagerly
ranged
himself
on
the
people
side
he
had
an
idea
of
publishing
a
series
of
poems
adapted
expressly
to
commemorate
their
circumstances
and
wrongs
he
wrote
a
few
but
in
those
days
of
prosecution
for
libel
they
could
not
be
printed
they
are
not
among
the
best
of
his
productions
a
writer
being
always
shackled
when
he
endeavours
to
write
down
to
the
comprehension
of
those
who
could
not
understand
or
feel
a
highly
imaginative
style
but
they
show
his
earnestness
and
with
what
compassion
he
went
home
to
the
direct
point
of
injury
that
oppression
is
detestable
as
being
the
parent
of
starvation
nakedness
and
ignorance
besides
these
outpourings
of
compassion
and
indignation
he
had
meant
to
adorn
the
cause
he
loved
with
loftier
poetry
of
glory
and
triumph
such
is
the
scope
of
the

undergrowth

and
pulpous
and
blistering
and
blue
livid

starred
with
a
lurid
dew
and
agarics

fungi
with
mildew
and
mould
started
like

from

cold
pale
fleshy
as
if
the
decaying
dead
with
a
spirit
of
growth
had
been
animated
spawn
weeds
and
filth
a
leprous
scum
made
the
running
rivulet
thick
and
dumb
and
at
its
outlet
flags
huge
as
stakes
dammed
it
up
with
roots
knotted
like
and
hour
by
hour
when
the
air
was
still
the
vapours
arose
which
have
strength
to
kill
at
morn
they
were
seen
at
noon
they
were
felt
at
night
they
were
darkness
no
star
could
melt
and
unctuous
meteors
from
spray
to
spray
crept
and
flitted
in
broad
noonday
unseen
every
branch
on
which
they
alit
by
a
venomous
blight
was
burned
and
bit
the
sensitive
plant
like
one
forbid
wept
and
the
tears
within
each
lid
of
its
folded
leaves
which
together
grew
were
changed
to
a
blight
of
frozen
glue
for
the
leaves
soon
fell
and
the
branches
soon
by
the
heavy
axe
of
the
blast
were
hewn
the
sap
shrank
to
the
root
through
every
pore
as
blood
to
a
heart
that
will
beat
no
more
for
winter
came
the
wind
was
his
whip
one
choppy
finger
was
on
his
lip
he
had
torn
the
cataracts
from
the
hills
and
they
clanked
at
his
girdle
like
manacles
his
breath
was
a
chain
which
without
a
sound
the
earth
and
the
air
and
the
water
bound
he
came
fiercely
driven
in
his
by
the
tenfold
blasts
of
the
arctic
zone
then
the
weeds
which
were
forms
of
living
death
fled
from
the
frost
to
the
earth
beneath
their
decay
and
sudden
flight
from
frost
was
but
like
the
vanishing
of
a
ghost
and
under
the
roots
of
the
sensitive
plant
the
moles
and
the
dormice
died
for
want
the
birds
dropped
stiff
from
the
frozen
air
and
were
caught
in
the
branches
naked
and
bare
first
there
came
down
a
thawing
rain
and
its
dull
drops
froze
on
the
boughs
again
then
there
steamed
up
a
freezing
dew
which
to
the
drops
of
the
grew
and
a
northern
whirlwind
wandering
about
like
a
wolf
that
had
smelt
a
dead
child
out
shook
the
boughs
thus
laden
and
heavy
and
stiff
and
snapped
them
off
with
his
rigid
griff
when
winter
had
gone
and
spring
came
back
the
sensitive
plant
was
a
leafless
wreck
but
the
mandrakes
and
toadstools
and
docks
and
darnels
rose
like
the
dead
from
their
ruined
charnels
conclusion
whether
the
sensitive
plant
or
that
which
within
its
boughs
like
a
spirit
sat
ere
its
outward
form
had
known
decay
now
felt
this
change
i
can
not
say
whether
that
lady
gentle
mind
no
longer
with
the
form
combined
which
scattered
love
as
stars
do
light
found
sadness
where
it
left
delight
i
dare
not
guess
but
in
this
life
of
error
ignorance
and
strife
where
nothing
is
but
all
things
seem
and
we
the
shadows
of
the
dream
it
is
a
modest
creed
and
yet
pleasant
if
one
considers
it
to
own
that
death
itself
must
be
like
all
the
rest
a
mockery
that
garden
sweet
that
lady
fair
and
all
sweet
shapes
and
odours
there
in
truth
have
never
passed
away
we
is
ours
are
changed
not
they
for
love
and
beauty
and
delight
there
is
no
death
nor
change
their
might
exceeds
our
organs
which
endure

night
of

the

when

like

deluge
from

sees
the

trunks
of

spin

bend
as
if
heaven
was
ruining
in
which
they
seemed

sustain
with

mass
as
if

sunk
from

they
pass
to
their

with
an
earthquake
of

the

rolls
an
inanimate
bulk
like
a
corpse
on

clay
which
is
hungering
to
fold
its
corruption
around
it
meanwhile
from
the

one
deck
is
burst
up
by
the
waters
below

it
splits
like
the
ice

burst

nine
weeks
the

vessel
had
lain
on
the
windless
expanse
of
the
watery
plain
where
the
sun
cast
no
shadow
at
noon
and
there
seemed
to
be
fire
in
the
beams
of
the
moon
till
a
fog
gathered
up
from
the
deep
whose
breath
was
quick
pestilence
then
the
cold
sleep
crept
like
blight
through
the
ears
of
a
thick
field
of
corn
the
populous
vessel
and
even
and
morn
with
their
hammocks
for
coffins
the
seamen
aghast
like
dead
men
the
dead
limbs
of
their
comrades
cast
down
the
deep
which
closed
on
them
above
and
around
and
the
sharks
and
the
dogfish
their
unbound
and
were
glutted
like
jews
with
this
manna
rained
down
from
god
on
their
wilderness
one
after
one
the
mariners
died
on
the
eve
of
this
day
when
the
tempest
was
gathering
in
cloudy
array
but
seven
remained
six
the
thunder
has
smitten
and
they
lie
black
as
mummies
on
which

has
written
his
scorn
of
the
embalmer
the
seventh
from
the

an
pierced
through
his
breast
and
his
back
and
hung
out
to
the
tempest
a
wreck
on
the
wreck
no
more
at
the
helm
sits
a
woman
more
fair
than
heaven
when
unbinding
its
hair
it
sinks
with
the
sun
on
the
earth
and
the
sea
she
clasps
a
bright
child
on
her
upgathered
knee
it
laughs
at
the
lightning
it
mocks
the
mixed
thunder
of
the
air
and
the
sea
with
desire
and
with
wonder
it
is
beckoning
the
tigers
to
rise
and
come
near
it
would
play
with
those
eyes
where
the
radiance
of
fear
is
outshining
the
meteors
its
bosom
beats
high
the
of
pleasure
has
kindled
its
eye
while
its
mother
is
lustreless
not
my
child
but
sleep
deeply
and
sweetly
and
so
be
beguiled
of
the
pang
that
awaits
us
whatever
that
be
so
dreadful
since
thou
must
divide
it
with
me

this

bosom
thy

thee
not

beating
with
dread
alas
what
is
life
what
is
death
what
are
we
that
when
the
ship
sinks
we
no
longer
may
be
what
to
see
thee
no
more
and
to
feel
thee
no
more
to
be
after
life
what
we
have
been
before
not
to
touch
those
sweet
hands
not
to
look
on

those

that
hair
all

smiling
disguise
thou
yet
wearest
sweet
spirit
which
i

by

have
so
long
called
my

which
now
fades
away

lo
the

settling
it
topples
the

the
tigers
leap
up
when
they
feel
the
slow
brine
crawling
inch

inch
on
them
hair

limbs
and
eyne
stand
rigid
with
horror
a
loud
long
hoarse
cry
bursts
at
once
from
their
vitals
tremendously
and
is
borne
down
the
mountainous
vale
of
the
wave
rebounding
like
thunder
from
crag
to
cave
mixed
with
the
clash
of
the
lashing
rain
hurried
on
by
the
might
of
the
hurricane
the
hurricane
came
from
the
west
and
passed
on
by
the
path
of
the
gate
of
the
eastern
sun
transversely
dividing
the
stream
of
the
storm
as
an
arrowy
serpent
pursuing
the
form
of
an
elephant
bursts
through
the
brakes
of
the
waste
black
as
a
cormorant
the
screaming
blast
between
ocean
and
heaven
like
an
ocean
passed
till
it
came
to
the
clouds
on
the
verge
of
the
world
which
based
on
the
sea
and
to
heaven
upcurled
like
columns
and
walls
did
surround
and
sustain
the
dome
of
the
tempest
it
rent
them
in
twain
as
a
flood
rends
its
barriers
of
mountainous
crag
and
the
dense
clouds
in
many
a
ruin
and
rag
like
the
stones
of
a
temple

passed
like

its
fall

like
foam
on
the
torrent

where
the

has
burst
out
through
the
chasm
from
the
air
of
clear
morning
the
beams
of
the
sunrise
flow
in
unimpeded
keen
golden
and
crystalline
banded
armies
of
light
and
of
air
at
one
gate
they
encounter
but
interpenetrate
and
that
breach
in
the
tempest
is
widening
away
and
the
caverns
of
cloud
are
torn
up
by
the
day
and
the
fierce
winds
are
sinking
with
weary
wings
lulled
by
the
motion
and
murmurings
and
the
long
glassy
heave
of
the
rocking
sea
and
overhead
glorious
but
dreadful
to
see
the
wrecks
of
the
tempest
like
vapours
of
gold
are
consuming
in
sunrise
the
heaped
waves
behold
the
deep
calm
of

still

the
presence
of

the

hail
to
thee
blithe
spirit
bird
thou
never
wert
that
from

or
near
it
pourest
thy
full
heart
in
profuse
strains
of
unpremeditated
art
higher
still
and
higher
from
the
earth
thou
springest
like
a
cloud
of
fire
the
blue
deep
thou
wingest
and
singing
still
dost
soar
and
soaring
ever
singest
in
the
golden
lightning
of
the
sunken
sun
which
clouds
are
thou
dost
float
and
run
like
an
unbodied
joy
whose
race
is
just
begun
the
pale
purple
even
melts
around
thy
flight
like
a
star
of
heaven
in
the
broad
daylight
thou
art
unseen
but
yet
i
hear
thy
shrill
delight
keen
as
are
the
arrows
of
that
silver
sphere
whose
intense
lamp
narrows
in
the
white
dawn
clear
until
we
hardly
see
we
feel
that
it
is
there
all
the
earth
and
air
with
thy
voice
is
loud
as
when
night
is
bare
from
one
lonely
cloud
the
moon
rains
out
her
beams
and
heaven
is
overflowed
what
thou
art
we
know
not
what
is
most
like
thee
from
rainbow
clouds
there
flow
not
drops
so
bright
to
see
as
from
thy
presence
showers
a
rain
of
melody
like
a
poet
hidden
in
the
light
of
thought
singing
hymns
unbidden
till
the
world
is
wrought
to
sympathy
with
hopes
and
fears
it
heeded
not
like
a
maiden
in
a
soothing
her
soul
in
secret
hour
with
music
sweet
as
love
which
overflows
her
bower
like
a
golden
in
a
dell
of
dew
scattering
unbeholden
its
aereal
hue
among
the
flowers
and
grass
which
screen
it
from
the
view
like
a
rose
embowered
in
its
own
green
leaves
by
warm
winds
deflowered
till
the
scent
it
gives
makes
faint
with
too
much
sweet
those
thieves
sound
of
vernal
showers
on
the
twinkling
grass
flowers
all
that
ever
was
joyous
and
clear
and
fresh
thy
music
doth
surpass
teach
us
sprite
or
bird
what
sweet
thoughts
are
thine
i
have
never
heard
praise
of
love
or
wine
that
panted
forth
a
flood
of
rapture
so
divine
chorus
hymeneal
or
triumphal
chant
matched
with
thine
would
be
all
but
an
empty
vaunt
a
thing
wherein
we
feel
there
is
some
hidden
want
what
objects
are
the
fountains
of
thy
happy
strain
what
fields
or
waves
or
mountains
what
shapes
of
sky
or
plain
what
love
of
thine
own
kind
what
ignorance
of
pain
with
thy
clear
keen
joyance
languor
can
not
be
shadow
of
annoyance
never
came
near
thee
thou
lovest
but
knew
love
sad
satiety
waking
or
asleep
thou
of
death
must
deem
things
more
true
and
deep
than
we
mortals
dream
or
how
could
thy
notes
flow
in
such
a
crystal
stream
we
look
before
and
after
and
pine
for
what
is
not
our
sincerest
laughter
with
some
pain
is
fraught
our
sweetest
songs
are
those
that
tell
of
saddest
thought
yet
if
we
could
scorn
hate
and
pride
and
fear
if
we
were
things
born
not
to
shed
a
tear
i
know
not
how
thy
joy
we
ever
should
come
near
better
than
all
measures
of
delightful
sound
better
than
all
treasures
that
in
books
are
found
thy
skill
to

were
thou
scorner
of

teach
me
half
the
gladness
that
thy

rome
was

from
thy
deep
bosom
fairest
like
a
from

cadmaean
maenad
she
drew
the
milk
of
greatness
though
thy
dearest
from
that
elysian
food
was
yet
unweaned
and
many
a
deed
of
terrible
uprightness
by
thy
sweet
love
was
sanctified
and
in
thy
smile
and
by
thy
side
saintly
camillus
lived
and
firm
atilius
died
but
when
tears
stained
thy
robe
of
and
gold
profaned
thy
capitolian
throne
thou
didst
desert
with
lightness
the
senate
of
the
tyrants
they
sunk
prone
slaves
of
one
tyrant
palatinus
sighed
faint
echoes
of
ionian
song
that
tone
thou
didst
delay
to
hear
lamenting
to
disown
from
what
hyrcanian
glen
or
frozen
hill
or
piny
promontory
of
the
arctic
main
or
utmost
islet
inaccessible
didst
thou
lament
the
ruin
of
thy
reign
teaching
the
woods
and
waves
and
desert
rocks
and
every
naiad
urn
to
talk
in
echoes
sad
and
stern
of
that
sublimest
lore
which
man
had
dared
unlearn
for
neither
didst
thou
watch
the
wizard
flocks
of
the
scald
dreams
nor
haunt
the
druid
sleep
what
if
the
tears
rained
through
thy
shattered
locks
were
quickly
dried
for
thou
didst
groan
not
weep
when
from
its
sea
of
death
to
kill
and
burn
the
galilean
serpent
forth
did
creep
and
made
thy
world
an
undistinguishable
heap
a
thousand
years
the
earth
cried
art
thou
and
then
the
shadow
of
thy
coming
fell
on
saxon
alfred
brow
and
many
a
citadel
like
rocks
which
fire
lifts
out
of
the
flat
deep
arose
in
sacred
italy
frowning
the
tempestuous
sea
of
kings
and
priests
and
slaves
in
majesty
that
multitudinous
anarchy
did
sweep
and
burst
around
their
walls
like
idle
foam
whilst
from
the
human
spirit
deepest
deep
strange
melody
with
love
and
awe
struck
dumb
dissonant
arms
and
art
which
can
not
die
with

traced
on

to

swifter

terror
of

thou
bearer
of
the
quiver

sunlike
shafts
pierce
error
as
light
may
pierce
the
clouds
when
they
dissever
in
the
calm
regions
of
the
orient
day
luther
caught
thy
wakening
glance
like
lightning
from
his
leaden
lance
reflected
it
dissolved
the
visions
of
the
trance
in
which
as
in
a
tomb
the
nations
lay
and
england
prophets
hailed
thee
as
their
queen
in
songs
whose
music
can
not
pass
away
though
it
must
flow
forever
not
unseen
before
the
countenance
of
milton
didst
thou
pass
from
the
sad
scene
beyond
whose
night
he
saw
with
a
dejected
mien
the
eager
hours
and
unreluctant
years
as
on
a
mountain
stood
trampling
to
silence
their
loud
hopes
and
fears
darkening
each
other
with
their
multitude
and
cried
aloud
indignation
answered
pity
from
her
cave
death
grew
pale
within
the
grave
and
desolation
howled
to
the
destroyer
save
when
like
heaven
sun
girt
by
the
exhalation
of
its
own
glorious
light
thou
didst
arise
chasing
thy
foes
from
nation
unto
nation
like
shadows
as
if
day
had
cloven
the
skies
at
dreaming
midnight
the
western

men
started
staggering
with
a
glad
surprise
under

spells
could
pall
thee
then
in
ominous
eclipse
a
thousand
years
bred
from
the
slime
of
deep
oppression
den
dyed
all
thy
liquid
light
with
blood
and

not
far
from
hence
from
yonder
pointed
hill
crowned
with
a
ring
of
oaks
you
may
behold
a
dark
and
barren
field
through
which
there
flows
sluggish
and
black
a
deep
but
narrow
stream
which
the
wind
ripples
not
and
the
fair
moon
gazes
in

and
finds
no

there
follow
the
herbless
banks
of
that
strange
brook
until
you
pause
beside
a
darksome
pond
the
fountain
of
this
rivulet
whose
gush
can
not
be
seen
hid
by
a
rayless
night
that
lives
beneath
the
overhanging
rock
that
shades
the
pool
an
endless
spring
of
gloom
upon
whose
edge
hovers
the
tender
light
trembling
to
mingle
with
its
paramour
but
as
syrinx
fled
pan
so
night
flies
day
or
with
most
sullen
and
regardless
hate
refuses
stern
her
embrace
on
one
side
of
this
jagged
and
shapeless
hill
there
is
a
cave
from
which
there
eddies
up
a
pale
mist
like
aereal
gossamer
whose
breath
destroys
all
life
awhile
it
veils
the
rock
then
scattered
by
the
wind
it
flies
along
the
stream
or
lingers
on
the
clefts
killing
the
sleepy
worms
if
aught

there
upon
the
beetling

of
that
dark
rock
there
stands
a
group
of
cypresses
not
such
as
with
a
graceful
spire
and
stirring
life
pierce
the
pure
heaven
of
your
native
vale
whose
branches
the
air
plays
among
but
not
disturbs
fearing
to
spoil
their
solemn
grace
but
blasted
and
all
wearily
they
stand
one
to
another
clinging
their
weak
boughs
sigh
as
the
wind
buffets
them
and
they
shake
beneath
its
blasts
a
weatherbeaten
crew
chorus
what
wondrous
sound
is
that
mournful
and
faint
but
more
melodious
than
the
murmuring
wind
which
through
the
columns
of
a
temple
glides
a
it
is
the
wandering
voice
of
orpheus
lyre
borne
by
the
winds
who
sigh
that
their
rude
king
hurries
them
fast
from
these
notes
but
in
their
speed
they
bear
along
with
them
the
waning
sound
scattering
it
like
dew
upon
the
startled
sense
chorus
does
he
still
sing
methought
he
rashly
cast
away
his
harp
when
he
had
lost
eurydice
a
ah
no
awhile
he
paused
as
a
poor
hunted
stag
a
moment
shudders
on
the
fearful
brink
of
a
swift
stream
the
cruel
hounds
press
on
with
deafening
yell
the
arrows
glance
and
wound
he
plunges
in
so
orpheus
seized
and
torn
by
the
sharp
fangs
of
an
insatiate
grief
waved
his
lyre
in
the
bright
air
and
wildly
shrieked
she
is
it
is
dark
and
then
he
struck
from
forth
the
strings
a
sound
of
deep
and
fearful
melody
alas
in
times
long
past
when
fair
eurydice
with
her
bright
eyes
sat
listening
by
his
side
he
gently
sang
of
high
and
heavenly
themes
as
in
a
brook
fretted
with
little
waves
by
the
light
airs
of
spring
each
riplet
makes
a
mirror
for
the
sun
while
it
flows
musically
through
green
banks
ceaseless
and
pauseless
ever
clear
and
fresh
so
flowed
his
song
reflecting
the
deep
joy
and
tender
love
that
fed
those
sweetest
notes
the
heavenly
offspring
of
ambrosial
food
but
that
is
past
returning
from
drear
hell
he
chose
a
lonely
seat
of
unhewn
stone
blackened
with
lichens
on
a
herbless
plain
then
from
the
deep
and
overflowing
spring
of
his
eternal
grief
there
rose
to
heaven
a
sound
of
angry
song
is
as
a
mighty
cataract
that
parts
two
sister
rocks
with
waters
swift
and
strong
and
casts
itself
with
horrid
roar
and
din
adown
a
steep
from
a
perennial
source
it
ever
flows
and
falls
and
breaks
the
air
with
loud
and
fierce
but
most
harmonious
roar
and
as
it
falls
casts
up
a
vaporous
spray
which
the
sun
clothes
in
hues
of
iris
light
thus
the
tempestuous
torrent
of
his
grief
is
clothed
in
sweetest
sounds
and
varying
words
of
poesy
unlike
all
human
works
it
never
slackens
and
through
every
change
wisdom
and
beauty
and
the
power
divine
of
mighty
poesy
together
dwell
mingling
in
sweet
accord
as
i
have
seen
a
fierce
south
blast
tear
through
the
darkened
sky
driving
along
a
rack
of
winged
clouds
which
may
not
pause
but
ever
hurry
on
as
their
wild
shepherd
wills
them
while
the
stars
twinkling
and
dim
peep
from
between
the
plumes
anon
the
sky
is
cleared
and
the
high
dome
of
serene
heaven
starred
with
fiery
flowers
shuts
in
the
shaken
earth
or
the
still
moon
swiftly
yet
gracefully
begins
her
walk
rising
all
bright
behind
the
eastern
hills

must
lend
me
words
used

i
must
borrow
from
her
perfect

forth
his
perfect

does
no

sit
upon
his
throne
of
rock
upon
a
desert
herbless
plain
for
the
evergreen
and
knotted
ilexes
and
cypresses
that
seldom
wave
their
boughs

olives
with
their

sent
from
her
maternal
breast
a
growth
of
starlike
flowers

to
pave
the

his

has
framed

near

grim
lions

fearless
from

creep
near

the

the
year
in
florence
where
shelley
passed
several
hours
daily
in
the
gallery
and
made
various
notes
on
its
ancient
works
of
art
his
thoughts
were
a
good
deal
taken
up
also
by
the
project
of
a
steamboat
undertaken
by
a
friend
an
engineer
to
ply
between
leghorn
and
marseilles
for
which
he
supplied
a
sum
of
money
this
was
a
sort
of
plan
to
delight
shelley
and
he
was
greatly
disappointed
when
it
was
thrown
aside
there
was
something
in
florence
that
disagreed
excessively
with
his
health
and
he
suffered
far
more
pain
than
usual
so
much
so
that
we
left
it
sooner
than
we
intended
and
removed
to
pisa
where
we
had
some
friends
and
above
all
where
we
could
consult
the
celebrated
vacca
as
to
the
cause
of
shelley
sufferings
he
like
every
other
medical
man
could
only
guess
at
that
and
gave
little
hope
of
immediate
relief
he
enjoined
him
to
abstain
from
all
physicians
and
medicine
and
to
leave
his
complaint
to
nature
as
he
had
vainly
consulted
medical
men
of
the
highest
repute
in
england
he
was
easily
persuaded
to
adopt
this
advice
pain
and
followed
him
to
the
end
but
the
residence
at
pisa
agreed
with
him
better
than
any
other
and
there
in
consequence
we
remained
in
the
spring
we
spent
a
week
or
two
near
leghorn
borrowing
the
house
of
some
friends
who
were
absent
on
a
journey
to
england
it
was
on
a
beautiful
summer
evening
while
wandering
among
the
lanes
whose
were
the
bowers
of
the
that
we
heard
the
carolling
of
the
skylark
which
inspired
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
his
poems
he
addressed
the
letter
to
gisborne
from
this
house
which
was
hers
he
had
made
his
study
of
the
workshop
of
her
son
who
was
an
engineer
gisborne
had
been
a
friend
of
my
father
in
her
younger
days
she
was
a
lady
of
great
accomplishments
and
charming
from
her
frank
and
affectionate
nature
she
had
the
most
intense
love
of
knowledge
a
delicate
and
trembling
sensibility
and
preserved
freshness
of
mind
after
a
life
of
considerable
adversity
as
a
favourite
friend
of
my
father
we
had
sought
her
with
eagerness
and
the
most
open
and
cordial
friendship
was
established
between
us
our
stay
at
the
baths
of
san
giuliano
was
shortened
by
an
accident
at
the
foot
of
our
garden
ran
the
canal
that
communicated
between
the
serchio
and
the
arno
the
serchio
overflowed
its
banks
and
breaking
its
bounds
this
canal
also
overflowed
all
this
part
of
the
country
is
below
the
level
of
its
rivers
and
the
consequence
was
that
it
was
speedily
flooded
the
rising
waters
filled
the
square
of
the
baths
in
the
lower
part
of
which
our
house
was
situated
the
canal
overflowed
in
the
garden
behind
the
rising
waters
on
either
side
at
last
burst
open
the
doors
and
meeting
in
the
house
rose
to
the
height
of
six
feet
it
was
a
picturesque
sight
at
night
to
see
the
peasants
driving
the
cattle
from
the
plains
below
to
the
hills
above
the
baths
a
fire
was
kept
up
to
guide
them
across
the
ford
and
the
forms
of
the
men
and
the
animals
showed
in
dark
relief
against
the
red
glare
of
the
flame
which
was
reflected
again
in
the
waters
that
filled
the
square
we
then
removed
to
pisa
and
took
up
our
abode
there
for
the
winter
the
extreme
mildness
of
the
climate
suited
shelley
and
his
solitude
was
enlivened
by
an
intercourse
with
several
intimate
friends
chance
cast
us
strangely
enough
on
this
quiet
town
but
its
very
peace
suited
shelley
its
river
the
near
mountains
and
not
distant
sea
added
to
its
attractions
and
were
the
objects
of
many
delightful
excursions
we
feared
the
south
of
italy
and
a
hotter
climate
on
account
of
our
child
our
former
bereavement
inspiring
us
with
terror
we
seemed
to
take
root
here
and
moved
little
afterwards
often
indeed
entertaining
projects
for
visiting
other
parts
of
italy
but
still
delaying
but
for
our
fears
on
account
of
our
child
i
believe
we
should
have
wandered
over
the
world
both
being
passionately
fond
of
travelling
but
human
life
besides
its
great
unalterable
necessities
is
ruled
by
a
thousand
lilliputian
ties
that
shackle
at
the
time

it
is
difficult
to

afterwards

he
would
have
said
of
broken

but
she
with
patient
look
the
golden
circle
from

finger
took
and
said
this
token
of
my
faith
the
pledge
of
vows
to
be
absolved
by
death
and
i
am
dead
or
shall
be

my

will

a
corpse
out

the
flowers

strewn
will
serve
unfaded
for

soon
that
even
the
dying
violet
will
not
die
before
ginevra
the
strong
fantasy
had
made
her
accents
weaker
and
more
weak
and
quenched
the
crimson
life
upon
her
cheek
and
glazed
her
eyes
and
spread
an
atmosphere
round
her
which
chilled
the
burning
noon
with
fear
making
her
but
an
image
of
the
thought
which
like
a
prophet
or
a
shadow
brought
news
of
the
terrors
of
the
coming
time
like
an
accuser
branded
with
the
crime
he
would
have
cast
on
a
beloved
friend
whose
dying
eyes
reproach
not
to
the
end
the
pale
betrayer
he
then
with
vain
repentance
would
share
he
can
not
now
avert
the
sentence
antonio
stood
and
would
have
spoken
when
the
compound
voice
of
women
and
of
men
was
heard
approaching
he
retired
while
she
was
led
amid
the
admiring
company
back
to
the
palace
and
her
maidens
soon
changed
her
attire
for
the
afternoon
and
left
her
at
her
own
request
to
keep
an
hour
of
quiet
rest
like
one
asleep
with
open
eyes
and
folded
hands
she
lay
pale
in
the
light
of
the
declining
day
meanwhile
the
day
sinks
fast
the
sun
is
set
and
in
the
lighted
hall
the
guests
are
met
the
beautiful
looked
lovelier
in
the
light
of
love
and
admiration
and
delight
reflected
from
a
thousand
hearts
and
eyes
kindling
a
momentary
paradise
this
crowd
is
safer
than
the
silent
wood
where
love
own
doubts
disturb
the
solitude
on
frozen
hearts
the
fiery
rain
of
wine
falls
and
the
dew
of
music
more
divine
tempers
the
deep
emotions
of
the
time
to
spirits
cradled
in
a
sunny
clime
how
many
meet
who
never
yet
have
met
to
part
too
soon
but
never
to
forget
how
many
saw
the
beauty
power
and
wit
of
looks
and
words
which
enchanted
yet
but
life
familiar
veil
was
now
withdrawn
as
the
world
leaps
before
an
earthquake
dawn
and
unprophetic
of
the
coming
hours
the
matin
winds
from
the
expanded
flowers
scatter
their
hoarded
incense
and
awaken
the
earth
until
the
dewy
sleep
is
shaken
from
every
living
heart
which
it
possesses
through
seas
and
winds
cities
and
wildernesses
as
if
the
future
and
the
past
were
all
treasured
i
the
instant
so
gherardi
hall
laughed
in
the
mirth
of
its
lord
festival
till
some
one
asked
is
the
bride
and
then
a
bridesmaid
went
and
ere
she
came
again
a
silence
fell
upon
the
guests
a
pause
of
expectation
as
when
beauty
awes
all
hearts
with
its
approach
though
unbeheld
then
wonder
and
then
fear
that
wonder
quelled
for
whispers
passed
from
mouth
to
ear
which
drew
the
colour
from
the
hearer
cheeks
and
flew
louder
and
swifter
round
the
company
and
then
gherardi
entered
with
an
eye
of
ostentatious
trouble
and
a
crowd
surrounded
him
and
some
were
weeping
loud
they
found
ginevra
dead
if
it
be
death
to
lie
without
motion
or
pulse
or
breath
with
waxen
cheeks
and
limbs
cold
stiff
and
white
and
open
eyes
whose
fixed
and
glassy
light
mocked
at
the
speculation
they
had
owned
if
it
be
death
when
there
is
felt
around
a
smell
of
clay
a
pale
and
icy
glare
and
silence
and
a
sense
that
lifts
the
hair
from
the
scalp
to
the
ankles
as
it
were
corruption
from
the
spirit
passing
forth
and
giving
all
it
shrouded
to
the
earth
and
leaving
as
swift
lightning
in
its
flight
ashes
and
smoke
and
darkness
in
our
night
of
thought
we
know
thus
much
of
death
no
more
than
the
unborn
dream
of
our
life
before
their
barks
are
wrecked
on
its
inhospitable
shore
the
marriage
feast
and
its
solemnity
was
turned
to
funeral
pomp
the
company
with
heavy
hearts
and
looks
broke
up
nor
they
who
loved
the
dead
went
weeping
on
their
way
alone
but
sorrow
mixed
with
sad
surprise
loosened
the
springs
of
pity
in
all
eyes
on
which
that
form
whose
fate
they
weep
in
vain
will
never
thought
they
kindle
smiles
again
the
lamps
which
half
extinguished
in
their
haste
gleamed
few
and
faint
the
abandoned
feast
showed
as
it
were
within
the
vaulted
room
a
cloud
of
sorrow
hanging
as
if
gloom
had
passed
out
of
men
minds
into
the
air
some
few
yet
stood
around
gherardi
there
friends
and
relations
of
the
dead
and
he
a
loveless
man
accepted
torpidly
the
consolation
that
he
wanted
not
awe
in
the
place
of
grief
within
him
wrought
their
whispers
made
the
solemn
silence
seem
more
still
some
wept
some
melted
into
tears
without
a
sob
and
some
with
hearts
that
might
be
heard
to
throb
leaned
on
the
table
and
at
intervals
shuddered
to
hear
through
the
deserted
halls
and
corridors
the
thrilling
shrieks
which
came
upon
the
breeze
of
night
that
shook
the
flame
of
every
torch
and
taper
as
it
swept
from
out
the
chamber
where
the
women
kept
their
tears
fell
on
the
dear
companion
cold
of
pleasures
now
departed
then
was
knolled
the
bell
of
death
and
soon
the
priests
arrived
and
finding
death
their
penitent
had
shrived
returned
like
ravens

corpse
whereon
a
vulture

just

the

gone

no

down

desolation

those

the
desert
and
the
solitude

which
we
are
forced
to
linger

never

there
is
much
in
the
adonais
which
seems
now
more
applicable
to
shelley
himself
than
to
the
young

poet
whom
he
mourned
the
poetic
view
he
takes
of
death
and
the
lofty
scorn
he
displays
towards
his
calumniators
are
as
a
prophecy
on
his
own

received
among
immortal
names

poisonous

shelley
favourite
taste
was
boating
when
living
near
the
thames
or
by
the
lake
of
geneva
much
of
his
life
was
spent
on
the
water
on
the
shore
of
every
lake
or
stream
or
sea
near
which
he
dwelt
he
had
a
boat
moored
he
had
latterly
enjoyed
this
pleasure
again
there
are
no
on
the
arno
and
the
shallowness
of
its
waters
except
in
when
the
stream
is
too
turbid
and
impetuous
for
boating
rendered
it
difficult
to
get
any
skiff
light
enough
to
float
shelley
however
overcame
the
difficulty
he
together
with
a
friend
contrived
a
boat
such
as
the
huntsmen
carry
about
with
them
in
the
maremma
to
cross
the
sluggish
but
deep
streams
that
intersect
the
forests
a
boat
of
laths
and
pitched
canvas
it
held
three
persons
and
he
was
often
seen
on
the
arno
in
it
to
the
horror
of
the
italians
who
remonstrated
on
the
danger
and
could
not
understand
how
anyone
could
take
pleasure
in
an
exercise
that
risked
life
va
per
la
vita
they
exclaimed
i
little
thought
how
true
their
words
would
prove
he
once
ventured
with
a
friend
on
the
glassy
sea
of
a
calm
day
down
the
arno
and
round
the
coast
to
leghorn
which
by
keeping
close
in
shore
was
very
practicable
they
returned
to
pisa
by
the
canal
when
missing
the
direct
cut
they
got
entangled
among
weeds
and
the
boat
upset
a
wetting
was
all
the
harm
done
except
that
the
intense
cold
of
his
drenched
clothes
made
shelley
faint
once
i
went
down
with
him
to
the
mouth
of
the
arno
where
the
stream
then
high
and
swift
met
the
tideless
sea
and
disturbed
its
sluggish
waters
it
was
a
waste
and
dreary
scene
the
desert
sand
stretched
into
a
point
surrounded
by
waves
that
broke
idly
though
perpetually
around
it
was
a
scene
very
similar
to
lido
of
which
he
had
said
love
all
waste
and
solitary
places
where
we
taste
the
pleasure
of
believing
what
we
see
is
boundless
as
we
wish
our
souls
to
be
and
such
was
this
wide
ocean
and
this
shore
more
barren
than
its
billows
our
little
boat
was
of
greater
use
unaccompanied
by
any
danger
when
we
removed
to
the
baths
some
friends
lived
at
the
village
of
pugnano
four
miles
off
and
we
went
to
and
fro
to
see
them
in
our
boat
by
the
canal
which
fed
by
the
serchio
was
though
an
artificial
a
full
and
picturesque
stream
making
its
way
under
verdant
banks
sheltered
by
trees
that
dipped
their
boughs
into
the
murmuring
waters
by
day
multitudes
of
ephemera
darted
to
and
fro
on
the
surface
at
night
the
fireflies
came
out
among
the
shrubs
on
the
banks
the
cicale
at
kept
up
their
hum
the
aziola
cooed
in
the
quiet
evening
it
was
a
pleasant
summer
bright
in
all
but
shelley
health
and
inconstant
spirits
yet
he
enjoyed
himself
greatly
and
became
more
and
more
attached
to
the
part
of
the
country
were
chance
appeared
to
cast
us
sometimes
he
projected
taking
a
farm
situated
on
the
height
of
one
of
the
near
hills
surrounded
by
chestnut
and
pine
woods
and
overlooking
a
wide
extent
of
country
or
settling
still
farther
in
the
maritime
apennines
at
massa
several
of
his
slighter
and
unfinished
poems
were
inspired
by
these
scenes
and
by
the
companions
around
us
it
is
the
nature
of
that
poetry
however
which
overflows
from
the
soul
oftener
to
express
sorrow
and
regret
than
joy
for
it
is
when
oppressed
by
the
weight
of
life
and
away
from
those
he
loves
that
the
poet
has
recourse
to
the
solace
of
expression
in
verse
still
shelley
passion
was
the
ocean
and
he
wished
that
our
summers
instead
of
being
passed
among
the
hills
near
pisa
should
be
spent
on
the
shores
of
the
sea
it
was
very
difficult
to
find
a
spot
we
shrank
from
naples
from
a
fear
that
the
heats
would
disagree
with
percy
leghorn
had
lost
its
only
attraction
since
our
friends
who
had
resided
there
were
returned
to
england
and
monte
nero
being
the
resort
of
many
english
we
did
not
wish
to
find
ourselves
in
the
midst
of
a
colony
of
chance
travellers
no
one
then
thought
it
possible
to
reside
at
via
reggio
which
latterly
has
become
a
summer
resort
the
low
lands
and
bad
air
of
maremma
stretch
the
whole
length
of
the
western
shores
of
the
mediterranean
till
broken
by
the
rocks
and
hills
of
spezia
it
was
a
vague
idea
but
shelley
suggested
an
excursion
to
spezia
to
see
whether
it
would
be
feasible
to
spend
a
summer
there
the
beauty
of
the
bay
enchanted
him
we
saw
no
house
to
suit
us
but
the
notion
took
root
and
many
circumstances
enchained
as
by
fatality
occurred
to
urge
him
to
execute
it
he
looked
forward
this
autumn
with
great
pleasure
to
the
prospect
of
a
visit
from
leigh
hunt
when
shelley
visited
lord
byron
at
ravenna
the
latter
had
suggested
his
coming
out
together
with
the
plan
of
a
periodical
work
in
which
they
should
all
join
shelley
saw
a
prospect
of
good
for
the
fortunes
of
his
friend
and
pleasure
in
his
society
and
instantly
exerted
himself
to
have
the
plan
executed
he
did
not
intend
himself
joining
in
the
work
partly
from
pride
not
wishing
to
have
the
air
of
acquiring
readers
for
his
poetry
by
associating
it
with
the
compositions
of
more
popular
writers
and
also
because
he
might
feel
shackled
in
the
free
expression
of
his
opinions
if
any
friends
were
to
be
compromised
by
those
opinions
carried
even
to
their
outermost
extent
he
wished
to
live
and
die
as
being
in
his
conviction
not
only
true
but
such
as
alone
would
conduce
to
the
moral
improvement
and
happiness
of
mankind
the
sale
of
the
work
might
meanwhile
either
really
or
supposedly
be
injured
by
the
free
expression
of
his
thoughts
and
this
evil
he
resolved
to
avoid
poems
written
in
the
zucca
published
by
shelley
posthumous
poems
and
dated
there

the

adore

thus
i
went
lamenting
when
i
saw
a
plant
upon
the
river
margin
lie
like
one
who
loved
beyond
his
nature
law
and
in
despair
had
cast
him
down
to
die
its
leaves
which
had
outlived
the
frost
the
thaw

blighted

a
heart

which

on

like
tears
too
true
the
heavens
had
wept
upon
it
but
the
earth
had
crushed
it
on
her
maternal
breast
i
bore
it
to
my
chamber
and
i
planted
it
in
a
vase
full
of
the
lightest
mould
the
winter
beams
which
out
of
heaven
slanted
fell
through
the
disrobed
of
cold
upon
its
leaves
and
flowers
the
stars
which
panted
in
evening
for
the
day
whose
car
has
rolled
over
the

wave
with
looks
of
light
smiled
on
it
from
the
threshold
of
the
night
the
mitigated
influences
of
air
and
light
revived
the
plant
and
from
it
grew
strong
leaves
and
tendrils
and
its
flowers
fair
full
as
a
cup
with
the
vine
burning
dew
with
golden
colours
an
atmosphere
of
vital
warmth
enfolded
it
anew
and
every
impulse
sent
to
every
part
the
unbeheld
pulsations
of
its
heart
well
might
the
plant
grow
beautiful
and
strong
even
if
the
air
and
sun
had
smiled
not
on
it
for
one
wept
it
all
the
winter
long
tears
pure
as

fell

for
sounds
of

song
mixed
with

stringed

that

it
to
leave

on
which
it

loosed
the

of
him
who
sat

the

in

the
tempest
in

the
whispering

were
half
asleep
the
clouds
were
gone
to
play
and
on
the
bosom
of
the
deep
the
smile
of

lay
it
seemed
as
if
the
hour
were
one
sent
from
beyond

which
scattered
from
above
the
sun
a
light
of
paradise
we
paused
amid
the
pines
that
stood
the
giants
of
the
waste
tortured
by
storms
to
shapes
as
rude
as
serpents
interlaced
and
soothed
by
every
azure
breath
that
under

is
blown
to
harmonies
and
hues
beneath
as
tender
as
its

now
all
the
lay
asleep

green
waves
on

as
still
as
in
the
silent
deep
the
ocean
woods
may
be
how
calm
it
was
the
silence
there
by
such
a
chain
was
bound
that
even
the
busy
woodpecker
made
stiller
by
her
sound
the
inviolable
quietness
the
breath
of
peace
we
drew
with
its
soft
motion
made
not
less
the
calm
that
round
us
grew
there
seemed
from
the
remotest
seat
of
the
white
mountain
waste
to
the
soft
flower
beneath
our
feet
a
magic
circle
traced
a
spirit
interfused
around
a
thrilling
silent
life
to
momentary
peace
it
bound
our
mortal
nature
strife
and
still
i
felt
the
centre
of
the
magic
circle
there
was
one
fair
form
that
filled
with
love
the
lifeless
atmosphere
we
paused
beside
the
pools
that
lie
under
the
forest
bough
each
seemed
as
a
little
sky
gulfed
in
a
world
below
a
firmament
of
purple
light
which
in
the
dark
earth
lay
more
boundless
than
the
depth
of

purer
than
the

in

the
lovely
forests
grew

there
there
lay

through

the

at

time
feared
that

correction

might
be
less

illness

i
believe
that
it
is
nearly
free
from
error
some
asterisks
occur
in
a
few
pages
as
they
did
in
the
volume

either
because
they
refer
to
private
concerns
or
because
the
original
manuscript
was
left
imperfect
did
any
one
see
the
papers
from
which
i
drew
that
volume
the
wonder
would
be
how
any
eyes
or
patience
were
capable
of
extracting
it
from
so
confused
a
mass
interlined
and
broken
into
fragments
so
that
the
sense
could
only
be
deciphered
and
joined
by
guesses
which
might
seem
rather
intuitive
than
founded
on
reasoning
yet
i
believe
no
mistake
was
made
the
winter
of
was
passed
in
pisa
if
we
might
call
that
season
winter
in
which
autumn
merged
into
spring
after
the
interval
of
but
few
days
of
bleaker
weather
spring
sprang
up
early
and
with
extreme
beauty
shelley
had
conceived
the
idea
of
writing
a
tragedy
on
the
subject
of
charles
i
it
was
one
that
he
believed
adapted
for
a
drama
full
of
intense
interest
contrasted
character
and
busy
passion
he
had
recommended
it
long
before
when
he
encouraged
me
to
attempt
a
play
whether
the
subject
proved
more
difficult
than
he
anticipated
or
whether
in
fact
he
could
not
bend
his
mind
away
from
the
broodings
and
wanderings
of
thought
divested
from
human
interest
which
he
best
loved
i
can
not
tell
but
he
proceeded
slowly
and
threw
it
aside
for
one
of
the
most
mystical
of
his
poems
the
triumph
of
life
on
which
he
was
employed
at
the
last
his
passion
for
boating
was
fostered
at
this
time
by
having
among
our
friends
several
sailors
his
favourite
companion
edward
ellerker
williams
of
the
light
dragoons
had
begun
his
life
in
the
navy
and
had
afterwards
entered

he
had
spent
several
years
in
india
and
his
love
for
adventure
and
manly
exercises
accorded
with
shelley
taste
it
was
their
favourite
plan
to
build
a
boat
such
as
they
could
manage
themselves
and
living
on
the
to
enjoy
at
every
hour
and

pleasure
they
loved

captain
roberts
undertook
to

the
boat
at
genoa
where
he
was
also
occupied

for
lord
byron
ours
was
to
be
an
open
boat
on
a
model
taken
from
one
of
the
royal
dockyards
i
have
since
heard
that
there
was
a
defect
in
this
model
and
that
it
was
never
seaworthy
in
the
month
of
february
shelley
and
his
friend
went
to
spezia
to
seek
for
houses
for
us
only
one
was
to
be
found
at
all
suitable
however
a
trifle
such
as
not
finding
a
house
could
not
stop
shelley
the
one
found
was
to
serve
for
all
it
was
unfurnished
we
sent
our
furniture
by
sea
and
with
a
good
deal
of
precipitation
arising
from
his
impatience
made
our
removal
we
left
pisa
on
the
of
april
the
bay
of
spezia
is
of
considerable
extent
and
divided
by
a
rocky
promontory
into
a
larger
and
smaller
one
the
town
of
lerici
is
situated
on
the
eastern
point
and
in
the
depth
of
the
smaller
bay
which
bears
the
name
of
this
town
is
the
village
of
san
terenzo
our
house
casa
magni
was
close
to
this
village
the
sea
came
up
to
the
door
a
steep
hill
sheltered
it
behind
the
proprietor
of
the
estate
on
which
it
was
situated
was
insane
he
had
begun
to
erect
a
large
house
at
the
summit
of
the
hill
behind
but
his
malady
prevented
its
being
finished
and
it
was
falling
into
ruin
he
had
and
this
to
the
italians
had
seemed
a
glaring
symptom
of
very
decided
madness
rooted
up
the
olives
on
the
hillside
and
planted
forest
trees
these
were
mostly
young
but
the
plantation
was
more
in
english
taste
than
i
ever
elsewhere
saw
in
italy
some
fine
walnut
and
ilex
trees
intermingled
their
dark
massy
foliage
and
formed
groups
which
still
haunt
my
memory
as
then
they
satiated
the
eye
with
a
sense
of
loveliness
the
scene
was
indeed
of
unimaginable
beauty
the
blue
extent
of
waters
the
almost
landlocked
bay
the
near
castle
of
lerici
shutting
it
in
to
the
east
and
distant
porto
venere
to
the
west
the
varied
forms
of
the
precipitous
rocks
that
bound
in
the
beach
over
which
there
was
only
a
winding
rugged
footpath
towards
lerici
and
none
on
the
other
side
the
tideless
sea
leaving
no
sands
nor
shingle
formed
a
picture
such
as
one
sees
in
salvator
rosa
landscapes
only
sometimes
the
sunshine
vanished
when
the
sirocco
raged
the
the
wind
was
called
on
that
shore
the
gales
and
squalls
that
hailed
our
first
arrival
surrounded
the
bay
with
foam
the
howling
wind
swept
round
our
exposed
house
and
the
sea
roared
unremittingly
so
that
we
almost
fancied
ourselves
on
board
ship
at
other
times
sunshine
and
calm
invested
sea
and
sky
and
the
rich
tints
of
italian
heaven
bathed
the
scene
in
bright
and
tints
the
natives
were
wilder
than
the
place
our
near
neighbours
of
san
terenzo
were
more
like
savages
than
any
people
i
ever
before
lived
among
many
a
night
they
passed
on
the
beach
singing
or
rather
howling
the
women
dancing
about
among
the
waves
that
broke
at
their
feet
the
men
leaning
against
the
rocks
and
joining
in
their
loud
wild
chorus
we
could
get
no
provisions
nearer
than
sarzana
at
a
distance
of
three
miles
and
a
half
off
with
the
torrent
of
the
magra
between
and
even
there
the
supply
was
very
deficient
had
we
been
wrecked
on
an
island
of
the
south
seas
we
could
scarcely
have
felt
ourselves
farther
from
civilisation
and
comfort
but
where
the
sun
shines
the
latter
becomes
an
unnecessary
luxury
and
we
had
enough
society
among
ourselves
yet
i
confess
housekeeping
became
rather
a
toilsome
task
especially
as
i
was
suffering
in
my
health
and
could
not
exert
myself
actively
at
first
the
fatal
boat
had
not
arrived
and
was
expected
with
great
impatience
on
monday
may
it
came
williams
records
the
fact
in
his
journal
and
threatening
weather
maglian
called
and
after
dinner
and
while
walking
with
him
on
the
terrace
we
discovered
a
strange
sail
coming
round
the
point
of
porto
venere
which
proved
at
length
to
be
shelley
boat
she
had
left
genoa
on
thursday
last
but
had
been
driven
back
by
the
prevailing
bad
winds
a
heslop
and
two
english
seamen
brought
her
round
and
they
speak
most
highly
of
her
performances
she
does
indeed
excite
my
surprise
and
admiration
shelley
and
i
walked
to
lerici
and
made
a
stretch
off
the
land
to
try
her
and
i
find
she
fetches
whatever
she
looks
at
in
short
we
have
now
a
perfect
plaything
for
the
summer
it
was
thus
that
mortals
welcomed
death
he
having
disguised
his
grim
form
in
a
pleasing
mask
the
time
of
the
friends
was
now
spent
on
the
sea
the
weather
became
fine
and
our
whole
party
often
passed
the
evenings
on
the
water
when
the
wind
promised
pleasant
sailing
shelley
and
williams
made
longer
excursions
they
sailed
several
times
to
massa
they
had
engaged
one
of
the
seamen
who
brought
her
round
a
boy
by
name
charles
vivian
and
they
had
not
the
slightest
apprehension
of
danger
when
the
weather
was
unfavourable
they
employed
themselves
with
alterations
in
the
rigging
and
by
building
a
boat
of
canvas
and
reeds
as
light
as
possible
to
have
on
board
the
other
for
the
convenience
of
landing
in
waters
too
shallow
for
the
larger
vessel
when
shelley
was
on
board
he
had
his
papers
with
him
and
much
of
the
triumph
of
life
was
written
as
he
sailed
or
weltered
on
that
sea
which
was
soon
to
engulf
him
the
heats
set
in
in
the
middle
of
june
the
days
became
excessively
hot
but
the
cooled
the
air
at
noon
and
extreme
heat
always
put
shelley
in
spirits
a
long
drought
had
preceded
the
heat
and
prayers
for
rain
were
being
put
up
in
the
churches
and
processions
of
relics
for
the
same
effect
took
place
in
every
town
at
this
time
we
received
letters
announcing
the
arrival
of
leigh
hunt
at
genoa
shelley
was
very
eager
to
see
him
i
was
confined
to
my
room
by
severe
illness
and
could
not
move
it
was
agreed
that
shelley
and
williams
should
go
to
leghorn
in
the
boat
strange
that
no
fear
of
danger
crossed
our
minds
living
on
the
the
ocean
became
as
a
plaything
as
a
child
may
sport
with
a
lighted
stick
till
a
spark
inflames
a
forest
and
spreads
destruction
over
all
so
did
we
fearlessly
and
blindly
tamper
with
danger
and
make
a
game
of
the
terrors
of
the
ocean
our
italian
neighbours
even
trusted
themselves
as
far
as
massa
in
the
skiff
and
the
running
down
the
line
of
coast
to
leghorn
gave
no
more
notion
of
peril
than
a
inland
navigation
would
have
done
to
those
who
had
never
seen
the
sea
once
some
months
before
trelawny
had
raised
a
warning
voice
as
to
the
difference
of
our
calm
bay
and
the
open
sea
beyond
but
shelley
and
his
friend
with
their
one
thought
themselves
a
match
for
the
storms
of
the
mediterranean
in
a
boat
which
they
looked
upon
as
equal
to
all
it
was
put
to
do
on
the
of
july
they
left
us
if
ever
shadow
of
future
ill
darkened
the
present
hour
such
was
over
my
mind
when
they
went
during
the
whole
of
our
stay
at
lerici
an
intense
presentiment
of
coming
evil
brooded
over
my
mind
and
covered
this
beautiful
place
and
genial
summer
with
the
shadow
of
coming
misery
i
had
vainly
struggled
with
these
emotions
they
seemed
accounted
for
by
my
illness
but
at
this
hour
of
separation
they
recurred
with
renewed
violence
i
did
not
anticipate
danger
for
them
but
a
vague
expectation
of
evil
shook
me
to
agony
and
i
could
scarcely
bring
myself
to
let
them
go
the
day
was
calm
and
clear
and
a
fine
breeze
rising
at
twelve
they
weighed
for
leghorn
they
made
the
run
of
about
fifty
miles
in
seven
hours
and
a
half
the
bolivar
was
in
port
and
the
regulations
of
the
not
permitting
them
to
go
on
shore
after
sunset
they
borrowed
cushions
from
the
larger
vessel
and
slept
on
board
their
boat
they
spent
a
week
at
pisa
and
leghorn
the
want
of
rain
was
severely
felt
in
the
country
the
weather
continued
sultry
and
fine
i
have
heard
that
shelley
all
this
time
was
in
brilliant
spirits
not
long
before
talking
of
presentiment
he
had
said
the
only
one
that
he
ever
found
infallible
was
the
certain
advent
of
some
evil
fortune
when
he
felt
peculiarly
joyous
yet
if
ever
fate
whispered
of
coming
disaster
such
inaudible
but
not
unfelt
prognostics
hovered
around
us
the
beauty
of
the
place
seemed
unearthly
in
its
excess
the
distance
we
were
at
from
all
signs
of
civilization
the
sea
at
our
feet
its
murmurs
or
its
roaring
for
ever
in
our
ears
all
these
things
led
the
mind
to
brood
over
strange
thoughts
and
lifting
it
from
everyday
life
caused
it
to
be
familiar
with
the
unreal
a
sort
of
spell
surrounded
us
and
each
day
as
the
voyagers
did
not
return
we
grew
restless
and
disquieted
and
yet
strange
to
say
we
were
not
fearful
of
the
most
apparent
danger
the
spell
snapped
it
was
all
over
an
interval
of
agonizing
doubt
of
days
passed
in
miserable
journeys
to
gain
tidings
of
hopes
that
took
firmer
root
even
as
they
were
more
baseless
was
changed
to
the
certainty
of
the
death
that
eclipsed
all
happiness
for
the
survivors
for
evermore
there
was
something
in
our
fate
peculiarly
harrowing
the
remains
of
those
we
lost
were
cast
on
shore
but
by
the
of
the
coast
we
were
not
permitted
to
have
possession
of
them
the
law
with
respect
to
everything
cast
on
land
by
the
sea
being
that
such
should
be
burned
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
any
remnant
bringing
the
plague
into
italy
and
no
representation
could
alter
the
law
at
length
through
the
kind
and
unwearied
exertions
of
dawkins
our
charge
at
florence
we
gained
permission
to
receive
the
ashes
after
the
bodies
were
consumed
nothing
could
equal
the
zeal
of
trelawny
in
carrying
our
wishes
into
effect
he
was
indefatigable
in
his
exertions
and
full
of
forethought
and
sagacity
in
his
arrangements
it
was
a
fearful
task
he
stood
before
us
at
last
his
hands
scorched
and
blistered
by
the
flames
of
the
and
by
touching
the
burnt
relics
as
he
placed
them
in
the
receptacles
prepared
for
the
purpose
and
there
in
compass
of
that
small
case
was
gathered
all
that
remained
on
earth
of
him
whose
genius
and
virtue
were
a
crown
of
glory
to
the
world
whose
love
had
been
the
source
of
happiness
peace
and
good
to
be
buried
with
him
the
concluding
stanzas
of
the
adonais
pointed
out
where
the
remains
ought
to
be
deposited
in
addition
to
which
our
beloved
child
lay
buried
in
the
cemetery
at
rome
thither
shelley
ashes
were
conveyed
and
they
rest
beneath
one
of
the
antique
towers
that
recur
at
intervals
in
the
circuit
of
the
massy
ancient
wall
of
rome
he
selected
the
hallowed
place
himself
there
is
sepulchre
oh
not
of
him
but
of
our
joy
and
gray
walls
moulder
round
on
which
dull
time
feeds
like
slow
fire
upon
a
hoary
brand
and
one
keen
pyramid
with
wedge
sublime
pavilioning
the
dust
of
him
who
planned
this
refuge
for
his
memory
doth
stand
like
flame
transformed
to
marble
and
beneath
a
field
is
spread
on
which
a
newer
band
have
pitched
in
heaven
smile
their
camp
of
death
welcoming
him
we
lose
with
scarce
extinguished
breath
could
sorrow
for
the
lost
and
shuddering
anguish
at
the
vacancy
left
behind
be
soothed
by
poetic
imaginations
there
was
something
in
shelley
fate
to
mitigate
pangs
which
yet
alas
could
not
be
so
mitigated
for
hard
reality
brings
too
miserably
home
to
the
mourner
all
that
is
lost
of
happiness
all
of
lonely
unsolaced
struggle
that
remains
still
though
dreams
and
hues
of
poetry
can
not
blunt
grief
it
invests
his
fate
with
a
sublime
fitness
which
those
less
nearly
allied
may
regard
with
complacency
a
year
before
he
had
poured
into
verse
all
such
ideas
about
death
as
give
it
a
glory
of
its
own
he
had
as
it
now
seems
almost
anticipated
his
own
destiny
and
when
the
mind
figures
his
skiff
wrapped
from
sight
by
the
as
it
was
last
seen
upon
the
purple
sea
and
then
as
the
cloud
of
the
tempest
passed
away
no
sign
remained
of
where
it
had
been
captain
roberts
watched
the
vessel
with
his
glass
from
the
top
of
the
lighthouse
of
leghorn
on
its
homeward
track
they
were
off
via
reggio
at
some
distance
from
shore
when
a
storm
was
driven
over
the
sea
it
enveloped
them
and
several
larger
vessels
in
darkness
when
the
cloud
passed
onwards
roberts
looked
again
and
saw
every
other
vessel
sailing
on
the
ocean
except
their
little
schooner
which
had
vanished
from
that
time
he
could
scarcely
doubt
the
fatal
truth
yet
we
fancied
that
they
might
have
been
driven
towards
elba
or
corsica
and
so
be
saved
the
observation
made
as
to
the
spot
where
the
boat
disappeared
caused
it
to
be
found
through
the
exertions
of
trelawny
for
that
effect
it
had
gone
down
in
ten
fathom
water
it
had
not
capsized
and
except
such
things
as
had
floated
from
her
everything
was
found
on
board
exactly
as
it
had
been
placed
when
they
sailed
the
boat
itself
was
uninjured
roberts
possessed
himself
of
her
and
decked
her
but
she
proved
not
seaworthy
and
her
shattered
planks
now
lie
rotting
on

of
the
moon
on
which
him
bore
the
venerable
may
from
her
immortal
limbs
he
leaped
full
soon
nor
long
could
in
the
sacred
cradle
keep
but
out
to
seek
apollo
herds
would
creep
out
of
the
lofty
cavern
wandering
he
found
a
tortoise
and
cried
out
treasure
for
mercury
first
made
the
tortoise
sing
the
beast
before
the
portal
at
his
leisure
the
flowery
herbage
was
depasturing
moving
his
feet
in
a
deliberate
measure
over
the
turf
jove
profitable
son
eying
him
laughed
and
laughing
thus
begun
useful
godsend
are
you
to
me
now
king
of
the
dance
companion
of
the
feast
lovely
in
all
your
nature
welcome
you
excellent
plaything
where
sweet
got
you
that
speckled
shell
thus
much
i
know
you
must
come
home
with
me
and
be
my
guest
you
will
give
joy
to
me
and
i
will
do
all
that
is
in
my
power
to
honour
you
to
be
at
home
than
out
of
door
so
come
with
me
and
though
it
has
been
said
that
you
alive
defend
from
magic
power
i
know
you
will
sing
sweetly
when
you
dead
thus
having
spoken
the
quaint
infant
bore
lifting
it
from
the
grass
on
which
it
fed
and
grasping
it
in
his
delighted
hold
his
treasured
prize
into
the
cavern
old
then
scooping
with
a
chisel
of
gray
steel
he
bored
the
life
and
soul
out
of
the
not
swifter
a
swift
thought
of
woe
or
weal
darts
through
the
tumult
of
a
human
breast
which
thronging
cares
annoy
not
swifter
wheel
the
flashes
of
its
torture
and
unrest
out
of
the
dizzy
eyes
than
maia
son
all
that
he
did
devise
hath
featly
done
and
through
the
tortoise
hard
stony
skin
at
proper
distances
small
holes
he
made
and
fastened
the
cut
stems
of
reeds
within
and
with
a
piece
of
leather
overlaid
the
open
space
and
fixed
the
cubits
in
fitting
the
bridge
to
both
and
stretched
all
symphonious
cords
of
rhythmical
when
he
had
wrought
the
lovely
instrument
he
tried
the
chords
and
made
division
meet
preluding
with
the
plectrum
and
there
went
up
from
beneath
his
hand
a
tumult
sweet
of
mighty
sounds
and
from
his
lips
he
sent
a
strain
of
unpremeditated
wit
joyous
and
wild
and
wanton
such
you
may
hear
among
revellers
on
a
holiday
he
sung
how
jove
and
may
of
the
bright
sandal
dallied
in
love
not
quite
legitimate
and
his
own
birth
still
scoffing
at
the
scandal
and
naming
his
own
name
did
celebrate
his
mother
cave
and
servant
maids
he
planned
all
in
plastic
verse
her
household
stuff
and
state
perennial
pot
trippet
and
brazen
pan
but
singing
he
conceived
another
plan
seized
with
a
sudden
fancy
for
fresh
meat
he
in
his
sacred
crib
deposited
the
hollow
lyre
and
from
the
cavern
sweet
rushed
with
great
leaps
up
to
the
mountain
head
revolving
in
his
mind
some
subtle
feat
of
thievish
craft
such
as
a
swindler
might
devise
in
the
lone
season
of
dun
night
lo
the
great
sun
under
the
ocean
bed
has
driven
steeds
and
chariot
the
child
meanwhile
strode
the
pierian
mountains
clothed
in
shadows
where
the
immortal
oxen
of
the
god
are
pastured
in
the
flowering
unmown
meadows
and
safely
stalled
in
a
remote
the
archer
argicide
elate
and
proud
drove
fifty
from
the
herd
lowing
aloud
he
drove
them
wandering
the
sandy
way
but
being
ever
mindful
of
his
craft
backward
and
forward
drove
he
them
astray
so
that
the
tracks
which
seemed
before
were
aft
his
sandals
then
he
threw
to
the
ocean
spray
and
for
each
foot
he
wrought
a
kind
of
raft
of
tamarisk
and
sprigs
and
bound
them
in
a
lump
with
withy
twigs
and
on
his
feet
he
tied
these
sandals
light
the
trail
of
whose
wide
leaves
might
not
betray
his
track
and
then
a
wight
like
a
man
hastening
on
some
distant
way
he
from
pieria
mountain
bent
his
flight
but
an
old
man
perceived
the
infant
pass
down
green
onchestus
heaped
like
beds
with
grass
the
old
man
stood
dressing
his
sunny
vine
old
fellow
with
the
crooked
shoulder
you
grub
those
stumps
before
they
will
bear
wine
methinks
even
you
must
grow
a
little
older
attend
i
pray
to
this
advice
of
mine
as
you
would
what
might
appal
a
bolder
seeing
see
not
and
hearing
hear
not
and
if
you
have
understanding
understand
so
saying
hermes
roused
the
oxen
vast
shadowy
mountain
and
resounding
dell
and
plains
great
hermes
passed
till
the
black
night
divine
which
favouring
fell
around
his
steps
grew
gray
and
morning
fast
wakened
the
world
to
work
and
from
her
cell
the
pallantean
moon
sublime
into
her
just
began
to
climb
now
to
alpheus
he
had
driven
all
the
oxen
of
the
sun
they
came
unwearied
to
the
lofty
stall
and
to
the
which
ever
run
through
the
fresh
fields
and
when
with
rushgrass
tall
lotus
and
all
sweet
herbage
every
one
had
pastured
been
the
great
god
made
them
move
towards
the
stall
in
a
collected
drove
a
mighty
pile
of
wood
the
god
then
heaped
and
having
soon
conceived
the
mystery
of
fire
from
two
smooth
laurel
branches
stripped
the
bark
and
rubbed
them
in
his
palms
on
high
suddenly
forth
the
burning
vapour
leaped
and
the
divine
child
saw
mercury
first
found
out
for
human
weal
matches
flint
and
steel
and
fine
dry
logs
and
roots
innumerous
he
gathered
in
a
delve
upon
the
ground
and
kindled
them
and
instantaneous
the
strength
of
the
fierce
flame
was
breathed
around
and
whilst
the
might
of
glorious
vulcan
thus
wrapped
the
great
pile
with
glare
and
roaring
sound
hermes
dragged
forth
two
heifers
lowing
loud
close
to
the
fire
such
might
was
in
the
god
and
on
the
earth
upon
their
backs
he
threw
the
panting
beasts
and
rolled
them
and
and
bored
their
lives
out
without
more
ado
he
cut
up
fat
and
flesh
and
down
before
the
fire
on
spits
of
wood
he
placed
the
two
toasting
their
flesh
and
ribs
and
all
the
gore
pursed
in
the
bowels
and
while
this
was
done
he
stretched
their
hides
over
a
craggy
stone
we
mortals
let
an
ox
grow
old
and
then
cut
it
up
after
long
consideration
but
hermes
from
the
glen
drew
the
fat
spoils
to
the
more
open
station
of
a
flat
smooth
space
and
portioned
them
and
when
he
had
by
lot
assigned
to
each
a
ration
of
the
twelve
gods
his
mind
became
aware
of
all
the
joys
which
in
religion
are
for
the
sweet
savour
of
the
roasted
meat
tempted
him
though
immortal
natheless
he
checked
his
haughty
will
and
did
not
eat
though
what
it
cost
him
words
can
scarce
express
and
every
wish
to
put
such
morsels
sweet
down
his
most
sacred
throat
he
did
repress
but
soon
within
the
lofty
portalled
stall
he
placed
the
fat
and
flesh
and
bones
and
all
and
every
trace
of
the
fresh
butchery
and
cooking
the
god
soon
made
disappear
as
if
it
all
had
vanished
through
the
sky
he
burned
the
hoofs
and
horns
and
head
and
hair
the
insatiate
fire
devoured
them
hungrily
and
when
he
saw
that
everything
was
clear
he
quenched
the
coal
and
trampled
the
black
dust
and
in
the
stream
his
bloody
sandals
tossed
all
night
he
worked
in
the
serene
moonshine
but
when
the
light
of
day
was
spread
abroad
he
sought
his
natal
divine
on
his
long
wandering
neither
man
nor
god
had
met
him
since
he
killed
apollo
kine
nor
had
barked
at
him
on
his
road
now
he
obliquely
through
the
keyhole
passed
like
a
thin
mist
or
an
autumnal
blast
right
through
the
temple
of
the
spacious
cave
he
went
with
soft
light
feet
as
if
his
tread
fell
not
on
earth
no
sound
their
falling
gave
then
to
his
cradle
he
crept
quick
and
spread
the
about
him
and
the
knave
lay
playing
with
the
covering
of
the
bed
with
his
left
hand
about
his
knees
the
right
held
his
beloved
tight
there
he
lay
innocent
as
a
child
as
gossips
say
but
though
he
was
a
god
the
goddess
his
fair
mother
unbeguiled
knew
all
that
he
had
done
being
abroad
come
you
and
from
what
adventure
wild
you
cunning
rogue
and
where
have
you
abode
all
the
long
night
clothed
in
your
impudence
what
have
you
done
since
you
departed
hence
soon
will
pass
within
this
gate
and
bind
your
tender
body
in
a
chain
inextricably
tight
and
fast
as
fate
unless
you
can
delude
the
god
again
even
when
within
his
arms
ah
runagate
a
pretty
torment
both
for
gods
and
men
your
father
made
when
he
made
you
mother
replied
sly
hermes
scold
and
bother
if
i
were
like
other
babes
as
old
and
understood
nothing
of
what
is
what
and
cared
at
all
to
hear
my
mother
scold
i
in
my
subtle
brain
a
scheme
have
got
which
whilst
the
sacred
stars
round
heaven
are
rolled
will
profit
you
and
me
nor
shall
our
lot
be
as
you
counsel
without
gifts
or
food
to
spend
our
lives
in
this
obscure
abode
we
will
leave
this
cave
and
live
among
the
gods
and
pass
each
day
in
high
communion
sharing
what
they
have
of
profuse
wealth
and
unexhausted
prey
and
from
the
portion
which
my
father
gave
to
phoebus
i
will
snatch
my
share
away
which
if
my
father
will
not
natheless
i
who
am
the
king
of
robbers
can
but
try
if
latona
son
should
find
me
out
i
countermine
him
by
a
deeper
plan
i
pierce
the
pythian
though
stout
and
sack
the
fane
of
everything
i
can
caldrons
and
tripods
of
great
worth
no
doubt
each
golden
cup
and
polished
brazen
pan
all
the
wrought
tapestries
and
garments
gay
so
they
together
talked
meanwhile
the
day
aethereal
born
arose
out
of
the
flood
of
flowing
ocean
bearing
light
to
men
apollo
passed
toward
the
sacred
wood
which
from
the
inmost
depths
of
its
green
glen
echoes
the
voice
of
neptune
and
there
stood
on
the
same
spot
in
green
onchestus
then
that
same
old
animal
the
who
was
employed
hedging
his
vineyard
there
latona
glorious
son
began
pray
tell
ancient
hedger
of
onchestus
green
whether
a
drove
of
kine
has
passed
this
way
all
heifers
with
crooked
horns
for
they
have
been
stolen
from
the
herd
in
high
pieria
where
a
black
bull
was
fed
apart
between
two
woody
mountains
in
a
neighbouring
glen
and
four
fierce
dogs
watched
there
unanimous
as
men
what
is
strange
the
author
of
this
theft
has
stolen
the
fatted
heifers
every
one
but
the
four
dogs
and
the
black
bull
are
left
stolen
they
were
last
night
at
set
of
sun
of
their
soft
beds
and
their
sweet
food
now
tell
me
man
born
ere
the
world
begun
have
you
seen
any
one
pass
with
the
cows
to
whom
the
man
of
overhanging
brows
friend
it
would
require
no
common
skill
justly
to
speak
of
everything
i
see
on
various
purposes
of
good
or
ill
many
pass
by
my
vineyard
and
to
me
difficult
to
know
the
invisible
thoughts
which
in
all
those
many
minds
may
be
thus
much
alone
i
certainly
can
say
i
tilled
these
vines
till
the
decline
of
day
then
i
thought
i
saw
but
dare
not
speak
with
certainty
of
such
a
wondrous
thing
a
child
who
could
not
have
been
born
a
week
those
cattle
closely
following
and
in
his
hand
he
held
a
polished
stick
and
as
on
purpose
he
walked
wavering
from
one
side
to
the
other
of
the
road
and
with
his
face
opposed
the
steps
he
trod
apollo
hearing
this
passed
quickly
on
no
winged
omen
could
have
shown
more
clear
that
the
deceiver
was
his
father
son
so
the
god
wraps
a
purple
atmosphere
around
his
shoulders
and
like
fire
is
gone
to
famous
pylos
seeking
his
kine
there
and
found
their
track
and
his
yet
hardly
cold
and
cried
wonder
do
mine
eyes
behold
are
the
footsteps
of
the
horned
herd
turned
back
towards
their
fields
of
asphodel
but
these
are
not
the
tracks
of
beast
or
bird
gray
wolf
or
bear
or
lion
of
the
dell
or
maned
centaur
sand
was
never
stirred
by
man
or
woman
thus
inexplicable
who
with
unwearied
feet
could
impress
the
sand
with
such
enormous
vestiges
was
most
strange
but
this
is
stranger
still
thus
having
said
phoebus
impetuously
sought
high
cyllene
hill
and
the
deep
cavern
where
dark
shadows
lie
and
where
the
ambrosial
nymph
with
happy
will
bore
the
saturnian
mercury
and
a
delightful
odour
from
the
dew
of
the
hill
pastures
at
his
coming
flew
and
phoebus
stooped
under
the
craggy
roof
arched
over
the
dark
cavern
maia
child
perceived
that
he
came
angry
far
aloof
about
the
cows
of
which
he
had
been
beguiled
and
over
him
the
fine
and
fragrant
woof
of
his
ambrosial
he
piled
as
among
lies
a
burning
spark
covered
beneath
the
ashes
cold
and
dark
there
like
an
infant
who
had
sucked
his
fill
and
now
was
newly
washed
and
put
to
bed
awake
but
courting
sleep
with
weary
will
and
gathered
in
a
lump
hands
feet
and
head
he
lay
and
his
beloved
tortoise
still
he
grasped
and
held
under
his
phoebus
the
lovely
knew
not
less
her
subtle
swindling
baby
who
lay
swathed
in
his
sly
wiles
round
every
crook
of
the
ample
cavern
for
his
kine
apollo
looked
sharp
and
when
he
saw
them
not
he
took
the
glittering
key
and
opened
three
great
hollow
recesses
in
the
rock
where
many
a
nook
was
filled
with
the
sweet
food
immortals
swallow
and
mighty
heaps
of
silver
and
of
gold
were
piled
within
a
wonder
to
behold
and
white
and
silver
robes
all
overwrought
with
cunning
workmanship
of
tracery
sweet
except
among
the
gods
there
can
be
nought
in
the
wide
world
to
be
compared
with
it
latona
offspring
after
having
sought
his
herds
in
every
corner
thus
did
greet
great
hermes
cradled
rogue
declare
of
my
illustrious
heifers
where
they
are
quickly
or
a
quarrel
between
us
must
rise
and
the
event
will
be
that
i
shall
hurl
you
into
dismal
tartarus
in
fiery
gloom
to
dwell
eternally
nor
shall
your
father
nor
your
mother
loose
the
bars
of
that
black
dungeon
utterly
you
shall
be
cast
out
from
the
light
of
day
to
rule
the
ghosts
of
men
unblessed
as
they
to
whom
thus
hermes
slily
answered
of
great
latona
what
a
speech
is
this
why
come
you
here
to
ask
me
what
is
done
with
the
wild
oxen
which
it
seems
you
miss
i
have
not
seen
them
nor
from
any
one
have
heard
a
word
of
the
whole
business
if
you
should
promise
an
immense
reward
i
could
not
tell
more
than
you
now
have
heard
should
be
both
tall
and
strong
and
i
am
but
a
little
thing
who
yet
at
least
can
think
of
nothing
wrong
my
business
is
to
suck
and
sleep
and
fling
the
about
me
all
day
long
or
half
asleep
hear
my
sweet
mother
sing
and
to
be
washed
in
water
clean
and
warm
and
hushed
and
kissed
and
kept
secure
from
harm
let
not
this
quarrel
be
averred
the
astounded
gods
would
laugh
at
you
if
you
should
allege
a
story
so
absurd
as
that
a
infant
forth
could
fare
out
of
his
home
after
a
savage
herd
i
was
born
yesterday
my
small
feet
are
too
tender
for
the
roads
so
hard
and
rough
and
if
you
think
that
this
is
not
enough
i
swear
a
great
oath
by
my
father
head
that
i
stole
not
your
cows
and
that
i
know
of
no
one
else
who
might
or
could
or
whatever
things
cows
are
i
do
not
know
for
i
have
only
heard
the
name
this
said
he
winked
as
fast
as
could
be
and
his
brow
was
wrinkled
and
a
whistle
loud
gave
he
like
one
who
hears
some
strange
absurdity
apollo
gently
smiled
and
said
ay
you
cunning
little
rascal
you
will
bore
many
a
rich
man
house
and
your
array
of
thieves
will
lay
their
siege
before
his
door
silent
as
night
in
night
and
many
a
day
in
the
wild
glens
rough
shepherds
will
deplore
that
you
or
yours
having
an
appetite
met
with
their
cattle
comrade
of
the
night
this
among
the
gods
shall
be
your
gift
to
be
considered
as
the
lord
of
those
who
swindle
and
but
now
if
you
would
not
your
last
sleep
doze
crawl
out
thus
saying
phoebus
did
uplift
the
subtle
infant
in
his
swaddling
clothes
and
in
his
arms
according
to
his
wont
a
scheme
devised
the
illustrious
argiphont
and
sneezed
and
shuddered
phoebus
on
the
grass
him
threw
and
whilst
all
that
he
had
designed
he
did
perform
eager
although
to
pass
apollo
darted
from
his
mighty
mind
towards
the
subtle
babe
the
following
scoff
not
imagine
this
will
get
you
off
little
swaddled
child
of
jove
and
may
and
seized
him
this
omen
i
shall
trace
my
noble
herds
and
you
shall
lead
the
way
cyllenian
hermes
from
the
grassy
place
like
one
in
earnest
haste
to
get
away
rose
and
with
hands
lifted
towards
his
face
round
both
his
ears
up
from
his
shoulders
drew
his
swaddling
clothes
and
mean
you
to
do
me
you
unkind
god
said
mercury
it
about
these
cows
you
tease
me
so
i
wish
the
race
of
cows
were
perished
i
stole
not
your
cows
i
do
not
even
know
what
things
cows
are
alas
i
well
may
sigh
that
since
i
came
into
this
world
of
woe
i
should
have
ever
heard
the
name
of
one
but
i
appeal
to
the
saturnian
throne
thus
phoebus
and
the
vagrant
mercury
talked
without
coming
to
an
explanation
with
adverse
purpose
as
for
phoebus
he
sought
not
revenge
but
only
information
and
hermes
tried
with
lies
and
roguery
to
cheat
but
when
no
evasion
served
for
the
cunning
one
his
match
had
found
he
paced
on
first
over
the
sandy
ground
he
of
the
silver
bow
the
child
of
jove
followed
behind
till
to
their
heavenly
sire
came
both
his
children
beautiful
as
love
and
from
his
equal
balance
did
require
a
judgement
in
the
cause
wherein
they
strove
odorous
olympus
and
its
snows
a
murmuring
tumult
as
they
came
arose
and
from
the
folded
depths
of
the
great
hill
while
hermes
and
apollo
reverent
stood
before
jove
throne
the
indestructible
immortals
rushed
in
mighty
multitude
and
whilst
their
seats
in
order
due
they
fill
the
lofty
thunderer
in
a
careless
mood
to
phoebus
said
drive
you
this
sweet
prey
this
born
but
yesterday
most
important
subject
trifler
this
to
lay
before
the
gods
father
nay
when
you
have
understood
the
business
say
not
that
i
alone
am
fond
of
prey
i
found
this
little
boy
in
a
recess
under
cyllene
mountains
far
away
a
manifest
and
most
apparent
thief
a
scandalmonger
beyond
all
belief
never
saw
his
like
either
in
heaven
or
upon
earth
for
knavery
or
craft
out
of
the
field
my
cattle
by
the
low
shore
on
which
the
loud
sea
laughed
he
right
down
to
the
had
driven
and
mere
astonishment
would
make
you
daft
to
see
the
double
kind
of
footsteps
strange
he
has
impressed
wherever
he
did
range
cattle
track
on
the
black
dust
full
well
is
evident
as
if
they
went
towards
the
place
from
which
they
came
that
asphodel
meadow
in
which
i
feed
my
many
herds
his
steps
were
most
incomprehensible
i
know
not
how
i
can
describe
in
words
those
tracks
he
could
have
gone
along
the
sands
neither
upon
his
feet
nor
on
his
hands
must
have
had
some
other
stranger
mode
of
moving
on
those
vestiges
immense
far
as
i
traced
them
on
the
sandy
road
seemed
like
the
trail
of
but
thence
no
mark
nor
track
denoting
where
they
trod
the
hard
ground
gave
but
working
at
his
fence
a
mortal
hedger
saw
him
as
he
passed
to
pylos
with
the
cows
in
fiery
haste
found
that
in
the
dark
he
quietly
had
sacrificed
some
cows
and
before
light
had
thrown
the
ashes
all
dispersedly
about
the
road
then
still
as
gloomy
night
had
crept
into
his
cradle
either
eye
rubbing
and
cogitating
some
new
sleight
no
eagle
could
have
seen
him
as
he
lay
hid
in
his
cavern
from
the
peering
day
taxed
him
with
the
fact
when
he
averred
most
solemnly
that
he
did
neither
see
nor
even
had
in
any
manner
heard
of
my
lost
cows
whatever
things
cows
be
nor
could
he
tell
though
offered
a
reward
not
even
who
could
tell
of
them
to
me
so
speaking
phoebus
sate
and
hermes
then
addressed
the
supreme
lord
of
gods
and
men
father
you
know
clearly
beforehand
that
all
which
i
shall
say
to
you
is
sooth
i
am
a
most
veracious
person
and
totally
unacquainted
with
untruth
at
sunrise
phoebus
came
but
with
no
band
of
gods
to
bear
him
witness
in
great
wrath
to
my
abode
seeking
his
heifers
there
and
saying
that
i
must
show
him
where
they
are
he
would
hurl
me
down
the
dark
abyss
i
know
that
every
apollonian
limb
is
clothed
with
speed
and
might
and
manliness
as
a
green
bank
with
flowers
but
unlike
him
i
was
born
yesterday
and
you
may
guess
he
well
knew
this
when
he
indulged
the
whim
of
bullying
a
poor
little
thing
that
slept
and
never
thought
of
i
like
a
strong
fellow
who
steals
kine
believe
me
dearest
father
such
you
are
this
driving
of
the
herds
is
none
of
mine
across
my
threshold
did
i
wander
so
may
i
thrive
i
reverence
the
divine
sun
and
the
gods
and
i
love
you
and
care
even
for
this
hard
accuser
who
must
know
i
am
as
innocent
as
they
or
you
swear
by
these
most
portals
it
is
you
will
allow
an
oath
of
might
through
which
the
multitude
of
the
immortals
pass
and
repass
forever
day
and
night
devising
schemes
for
the
affairs
of
mortals
i
am
guiltless
and
i
will
requite
although
mine
enemy
be
great
and
strong
his
cruel
threat
do
thou
defend
the
young
so
speaking
the
cyllenian
argiphont
winked
as
if
now
his
adversary
was
fitted
and
jupiter
according
to
his
wont
laughed
heartily
to
hear
the
infant
give
such
a
plausible
account
and
every
word
a
lie
but
he
remitted
judgement
at
present
and
his
exhortation
was
to
compose
the
affair
by
arbitration
and
they
by
mighty
jupiter
were
bidden
to
go
forth
with
a
single
purpose
both
neither
the
other
chiding
nor
yet
chidden
and
mercury
with
innocence
and
truth
to
lead
the
way
and
show
where
he
had
hidden
the
mighty
hermes
nothing
loth
obeyed
the
will
for
he
is
able
to
persuade
all
easily
these
lovely
children
of
heaven
highest
lord
hastened
to
pylos
and
the
pastures
wide
and
lofty
stalls
by
the
alphean
ford
where
wealth
in
the
mute
night
is
multiplied
with
silent
growth
whilst
hermes
drove
the
herd
out
of
the
stony
cavern
phoebus
spied
the
hides
of
those
the
little
babe
had
slain
stretched
on
the
precipice
above
the
plain
was
it
possible
then
phoebus
said
you
a
little
child
born
yesterday
a
thing
on
mother
milk
and
kisses
fed
could
two
prodigious
heifers
ever
flay
even
i
myself
may
well
hereafter
dread
your
prowess
offspring
of
cyllenian
may
when
you
grow
strong
and
tall
he
spoke
and
bound
stiff
withy
bands
the
infant
wrists
around
he
might
as
well
have
bound
the
oxen
wild
the
withy
bands
though
starkly
interknit
fell
at
the
feet
of
the
immortal
child
loosened
by
some
device
of
his
quick
wit
phoebus
perceived
himself
again
beguiled
and
stared
while
hermes
sought
some
hole
or
pit
looking
askance
and
winking
fast
as
thought
where
he
might
hide
himself
and
not
be
caught
sudden
he
changed
his
plan
and
with
strange
skill
subdued
the
strong
latonian
by
the
might
of
winning
music
to
his
mightier
will
his
left
hand
held
the
lyre
and
in
his
right
the
plectrum
struck
the
chords
unconquerable
up
from
beneath
his
hand
in
circling
flight
the
gathering
music
rose
and
sweet
as
love
the
penetrating
notes
did
live
and
move
within
the
heart
of
great
apollo
he
listened
with
all
his
soul
and
laughed
for
pleasure
close
to
his
side
stood
harping
fearlessly
the
unabashed
boy
and
to
the
measure
of
the
sweet
lyre
there
followed
loud
and
free
his
joyous
voice
for
he
unlocked
the
treasure
of
his
deep
song
illustrating
the
birth
of
the
bright
gods
and
the
dark
desert
earth
and
how
to
the
immortals
every
one
a
portion
was
assigned
of
all
that
is
but
chief
mnemosyne
did
maia
son
clothe
in
the
light
of
his
loud
melodies
and
as
each
god
was
born
or
had
begun
he
in
their
order
due
and
fit
degrees
sung
of
his
birth
and
being
and
did
move
apollo
to
unutterable
love
these
words
were
winged
with
his
swift
delight
schemer
well
do
you
deserve
that
fifty
oxen
should
requite
such
minstrelsies
as
i
have
heard
even
now
comrade
of
feasts
little
contriving
wight
one
of
your
secrets
i
would
gladly
know
whether
the
glorious
power
you
now
show
forth
was
folded
up
within
you
at
your
birth
whether
mortal
taught
or
god
inspired
the
power
of
unpremeditated
song
many
divinest
sounds
have
i
admired
the
olympian
gods
and
mortal
men
among
but
such
a
strain
of
wondrous
strange
untired
and
music
sweet
and
strong
yet
did
i
never
hear
except
from
thee
offspring
of
may
impostor
mercury
muse
what
skill
what
unimagined
use
what
exercise
of
subtlest
art
has
given
thy
songs
such
power
for
those
who
hear
may
choose
from
three
the
choicest
of
the
gifts
of
heaven
delight
and
love
and
sleep
sweet
sleep
whose
dews
are
sweeter
than
the
balmy
tears
of
even
and
i
who
speak
this
praise
am
that
apollo
whom
the
olympian
muses
ever
follow
their
delight
is
dance
and
the
blithe
noise
of
song
and
overflowing
poesy
and
sweet
even
as
desire
the
liquid
voice
of
pipes
that
fills
the
clear
air
thrillingly
but
never
did
my
inmost
soul
rejoice
in
this
dear
work
of
youthful
revelry
as
now
i
wonder
at
thee
son
of
jove
thy
harpings
and
thy
song
are
soft
as
love
since
thou
hast
although
so
very
small
science
of
arts
so
glorious
thus
i
swear
and
let
this
cornel
javelin
keen
and
tall
witness
between
us
what
i
promise
here
that
i
will
lead
thee
to
the
olympian
hall
honoured
and
mighty
with
thy
mother
dear
and
many
glorious
gifts
in
joy
will
give
thee
and
even
at
the
end
will
deceive
thee
to
whom
thus
mercury
with
prudent
speech
hast
thou
inquired
of
my
skill
i
envy
thee
no
thing
i
know
to
teach
even
this
day
for
both
in
word
and
will
i
would
be
gentle
with
thee
thou
canst
reach
all
things
in
thy
wise
spirit
and
thy
sill
is
highest
in
heaven
among
the
sons
of
jove
who
loves
thee
in
the
fulness
of
his
love
counsellor
supreme
has
given
to
thee
divinest
gifts
out
of
the
amplitude
of
his
profuse
exhaustless
treasury
by
thee
is
said
the
depths
are
understood
of
his
far
voice
by
thee
the
mystery
of
all
oracular
fates
and
the
dread
mood
of
the
diviner
is
breathed
up
even
i
a
child
perceive
thy
might
and
majesty
canst
seek
out
and
compass
all
that
wit
can
find
or
teach
yet
since
thou
wilt
come
take
the
lyre
be
mine
the
glory
giving
it
strike
the
sweet
chords
and
sing
aloud
and
wake
thy
joyous
pleasure
out
of
many
a
fit
of
tranced
sound
and
with
fleet
fingers
make
thy
comrade
talk
with
thee
it
can
talk
measured
music
eloquently
bear
it
boldly
to
the
revel
loud
dance
or
feast
of
solemn
state
a
joy
by
night
or
day
for
those
endowed
with
art
and
wisdom
who
interrogate
it
teaches
babbling
in
delightful
mood
all
things
which
make
the
spirit
most
elate
soothing
the
mind
with
sweet
familiar
play
chasing
the
heavy
shadows
of
dismay
those
who
are
unskilled
in
its
sweet
tongue
though
they
should
question
most
impetuously
its
hidden
soul
it
gossips
something
wrong
some
senseless
and
impertinent
reply
but
thou
who
art
as
wise
as
thou
art
strong
canst
compass
all
that
thou
desirest
i
present
thee
with
this
shell
knowing
thou
canst
interrogate
it
well
let
us
two
henceforth
together
feed
on
this
green
and
pastoral
plain
the
herds
in
litigation
they
will
breed
quickly
enough
to
recompense
our
pain
if
to
the
bulls
and
cows
we
take
good
heed
and
thou
though
somewhat
over
fond
of
gain
grudge
me
not
half
the
profit
having
spoke
the
shell
he
proffered
and
apollo
took
and
gave
him
in
return
the
glittering
lash
installing
him
as
herdsman
from
the
look
of
mercury
then
laughed
a
joyous
flash
and
then
apollo
with
the
plectrum
strook
the
chords
and
from
beneath
his
hands
a
crash
of
mighty
sounds
rushed
up
whose
music
shook
the
soul
with
sweetness
and
like
an
adept
his
sweeter
voice
a
just
accordance
kept
the
herd
went
wandering
the
divine
mead
whilst
these
most
beautiful
sons
of
jupiter
won
their
swift
way
up
to
the
snowy
head
of
white
olympus
with
the
joyous
lyre
soothing
their
journey
and
their
father
dread
gathered
them
both
into
familiar
affection
sweet
and
then
and
now
and
ever
hermes
must
love
him
of
the
golden
quiver
to
whom
he
gave
the
lyre
that
sweetly
sounded
which
skilfully
he
held
and
played
thereon
he
piped
the
while
and
far
and
wide
rebounded
the
echo
of
his
pipings
every
one
of
the
olympians
sat
with
joy
astounded
while
he
conceived
another
piece
of
fun
one
of
his
old
tricks
which
the
god
of
day
perceiving
said
fear
thee
son
of
may
fear
thee
and
thy
sly
chameleon
spirit
lest
thou
should
steal
my
lyre
and
crooked
bow
this
glory
and
power
thou
dost
from
jove
inherit
to
teach
all
craft
upon
the
earth
below
thieves
love
and
worship
thee
it
is
thy
merit
to
make
all
mortal
business
ebb
and
flow
by
roguery
now
hermes
if
you
dare
by
sacred
styx
a
mighty
oath
to
swear
you
will
never
rob
me
you
will
do
a
thing
extremely
pleasing
to
my
heart
then
mercury
swore
by
the
stygian
dew
that
he
would
never
steal
his
bow
or
dart
or
lay
his
hands
on
what
to
him
was
due
or
ever
would
employ
his
powerful
art
against
his
pythian
fane
then
phoebus
swore
there
was
no
god
or
man
whom
he
loved
more
i
will
give
thee
as
a
token
the
beautiful
wand
of
wealth
and
happiness
a
perfect
rod
of
gold
unbroken
whose
magic
will
thy
footsteps
ever
bless
and
whatsoever
by
jove
voice
is
spoken
of
earthly
or
divine
from
its
recess
it
like
a
loving
soul
to
thee
will
speak
and
more
than
this
do
thou
forbear
to
seek
dearest
child
the
divinations
high
which
thou
requirest
is
unlawful
ever
that
thou
or
any
other
deity
should
understand
and
vain
were
the
endeavour
for
they
are
hidden
in
jove
mind
and
i
in
trust
of
them
have
sworn
that
i
would
never
betray
the
counsels
of
jove
inmost
will
to
any
god
the
oath
was
terrible
brother
ask
me
not
to
speak
the
fates
by
jupiter
designed
but
be
it
mine
to
tell
their
various
lot
to
the
unnumbered
tribes
of
let
good
to
these
and
ill
to
those
be
wrought
as
i
dispense
but
he
who
comes
consigned
by
voice
and
wings
of
perfect
augury
to
my
great
shrine
shall
find
avail
in
me
will
i
not
deceive
but
will
assist
but
he
who
comes
relying
on
such
birds
as
chatter
vainly
who

flung
one

praised
me
hast
given
a

i

it
pleased

filled
another

well
knowing

the

would
wound
him
soon

take
a
sure
revenge
and
the
charm
fascinated
him

him
cup

the

had
warmed

him

oh

how
then
i
heard
of
old
that
thou
wert
wise
ulysses
i
will
dissuade
him
from
this
plan

saying
it
were
unwise
to
give
the
cyclopses
this
precious
drink
which
if
enjoyed
alone
would
make
life
sweeter
for
a
longer

vanquished
by
the
bacchic
power
he
sleeps
there
is
a
trunk
of
olive
wood
within
whose
point
having
made
sharp
with
this
good
sword
i
will
conceal
in
fire

when
i
see
it
is
alight
will
fix
it
burning
yet
within
the
socket
of
the
cyclops
eye

melt
it
out

how
the

spirit
moans
in

how
a
voice
there
murmurs
against
her
who
came
on
the
refulgence
of
your

a
sweet
thought
which
was
once
the
life
within
this
heavy
heart
man
a
time
and
oft
went
up
before
our
father
feet
and
there
it
saw
a
glorious
lady
throned
aloft
and
its
sweet
talk
of
her
my
soul
did
win
so
that
i
said
i
too
will
fare
that
thought
is
fled

one
doth
now
appear
which
tyrannizes
me
with
such
fierce
stress
that
my
heart
trembles
ye
may
see
it
leap
and
on
another
lady
bids
me
keep
mine
eyes
and
says
who
would
have
blessedness
let
him
but
look
upon
that
lady
eyes
let
him
not
fear
the
agony
of
sighs
this
lowly
thought
which
once
would
talk
with
me
of
a
bright
seraph
sitting
crowned
on
high
found
such
a
cruel
foe
it
died
and
so
my
spirit
wept
the
grief
is
hot
even
now
and
said
alas
for
me
how
swift
could
flee
that
piteous
thought
which
did
my
life
console
and
the
afflicted
one
questioning
mine
eyes
if
such
a
lady
saw
they
never
and
why
they
would
i
said
those
eyes
might
stand
for
ever
he
whom
regards
must
kill
with

their

me

i

thou
hast

thou

how

pitiful

staid

courteous
in

she
is

still
call

i

what

puffed

how
happens
it
although
you
can
maintain
the
folly
of

you

the
consequence
is
clear
who
ever

would
that

he

more

soho
livia
i
come
good
sport
livia
soho
exit
cyprian
now
since
i
am
alone
let
me
examine
the
question
which
has
long
disturbed
my
mind
with
doubt
since
first
i
read
in
plinius
the
words
of
mystic
import
and
deep
sense
in
which
he
defines
god
my
intellect
can
find
no
god
with
whom
these
marks
and
signs
fitly
agree
it
is
a
hidden
truth
which
i
must
fathom
cyprian
reads
the
daemon
dressed
in
a
court
dress
enters
note
stage
direction
so
transcr
reads
enter
the
devil
as
a
fine
gentleman
daemon
search
even
as
thou
wilt
but
thou
shalt
never
find
what
i
can
hide
cyprian
what
noise
is
that
among
the
boughs
who
moves
what
art
thou
daemon
a
foreign
gentleman
even
from
this
morning
i
have
lost
my
way
in
this
wild
place
and
my
poor
horse
at
last
quite
overcome
has
stretched
himself
upon
the
enamelled
tapestry
of
this
mossy
mountain
and
feeds
and
rests
at
the
same
time
i
was
upon
my
way
to
antioch
upon
business
of
some
importance
but
wrapped
up
in
cares
who
is
exempt
from
this
inheritance
i
parted
from
my
company
and
lost
my
way
and
lost
my
servants
and
my
comrades
cyprian
singular
that
even
within
the
sight
of
the
high
towers
of
antioch
you
could
lose
your
way
of
all
the
avenues
and
green
paths
of
this
wild
wood
there
is
not
one
but
leads
as
to
its
centre
to
the
walls
of
antioch
take
which
you
will
you
can
not
miss
your
road
daemon
and
such
is
ignorance
even
in
the
sight
of
knowledge
it
can
draw
no
profit
from
it
but
as
it
still
is
early
and
as
i
have
no
acquaintances
in
antioch
being
a
stranger
there
i
will
even
wait
the
few
surviving
hours
of
the
day
until
the
night
shall
conquer
it
i
see
both
by
your
dress
and
by
the
books
in
which
you
find
delight
and
company
that
you
are
a
great
student
for
my
part
i
feel
much
sympathy
in
such
pursuits
note
in
transcr
with
cyprian
have
you
studied
much
daemon
no
and
yet
i
know
enough
not
to
be
wholly
ignorant
cyprian
pray
sir
what
science
may
you
know
daemon
many
cyprian
alas
much
pains
must
we
expend
on
one
alone
and
even
then
attain
it
not
but
you
have
the
presumption
to
assert
that
you
know
many
without
study
daemon
and
with
truth
for
in
the
country
whence
i
come
the
sciences
require
no
learning
they
are
known
note
come
the
sciences
come
sciences
cyprian
oh
would
i
were
of
that
bright
country
for
in
this
the
more
we
study
we
the
more
discover
our
ignorance
daemon
it
is
so
true
that
i
had
so
much
arrogance
as
to
oppose
the
chair
of
the
most
high
professorship
and
obtained
many
votes
and
though
i
lost
the
attempt
was
still
more
glorious
than
the
failure
could
be
dishonourable
if
you
believe
not
let
us
refer
it
to
dispute
respecting
that
which
you
know
the
best
and
although
i
know
not
the
opinion
you
maintain
and
though
it
be
the
true
one
i
will
take
the
contrary
note
the
transcr
wanting
cyprian
the
offer
gives
me
pleasure
i
am
now
debating
with
myself
upon
a
passage
of
plinius
and
my
mind
is
racked
with
doubt
to
understand
and
know
who
is
the
god
of
whom
he
speaks
daemon
it
is
a
passage
if
i
recollect
it
right
couched
in
these
words
is
one
supreme
goodness
one
pure
essence
one
substance
and
one
sense
all
sight
all
hands
cyprian
true
daemon
what
difficulty
find
you
here
cyprian
i
do
not
recognize
among
the
gods
the
god
defined
by
plinius
if
he
must
be
supreme
goodness
even
jupiter
is
not
supremely
good
because
we
see
his
deeds
are
evil
and
his
attributes
tainted
with
mortal
weakness
in
what
manner
can
supreme
goodness
be
consistent
with
the
passions
of
humanity
daemon
the
wisdom
of
the
old
world
masked
with
the
names
of
gods
the
attributes
of
nature
and
of
man
a
sort
of
popular
philosophy
cyprian
this
reply
will
not
satisfy
me
for
such
awe
is
due
to
the
high
name
of
god
that
ill
should
never
be
imputed
then
examining
the
question
with
more
care
it
follows
that
the
gods
would
always
will
that
which
is
best
were
they
supremely
good
how
then
does
one
will
one
thing
one
another
and
that
you
may
not
say
that
i
allege
poetical
or
philosophic
learning
consider
the
ambiguous
responses
of
their
oracular
statues
from
two
shrines
two
armies
shall
obtain
the
assurance
of
one
victory
is
it
not
indisputable
that
two
contending
wills
can
never
lead
to
the
same
end
and
being
opposite
if
one
be
good
is
not
the
other
evil
evil
in
god
is
inconceivable
but
supreme
goodness
fails
among
the
gods
without
their
union
note
would
transcr
should
daemon
i
deny
your
major
these
responses
are
means
towards
some
end
unfathomed
by
our
intellectual
beam
they
are
the
work
of
providence
and
more
the
battle
loss
may
profit
those
who
lose
than
victory
advantage
those
who
win
cyprian
that
i
admit
and
yet
that
god
should
not
falsehood
is
incompatible
with
deity
assure
the
victory
it
would
be
enough
to
have
permitted
the
defeat
if
god
be
all
sight
god
who
had
beheld
the
truth
would
not
have
given
assurance
of
an
end
never
to
be
accomplished
thus
although
the
deity
may
according
to
his
attributes
be
well
distinguished
into
persons
yet
even
in
the
minutest
circumstance
his
essence
must
be
one
note
had
transcr
wanting
daemon
to
attain
the
end
the
affections
of
the
actors
in
the
scene
must
have
been
thus
influenced
by
his
voice
cyprian
but
for
a
purpose
thus
subordinate
he
might
have
employed
genii
good
or
evil
a
sort
of
spirits
called
so
by
the
learned
who
roam
about
inspiring
good
or
evil
and
from
whose
influence
and
existence
we
may
well
infer
our
immortality
thus
god
might
easily
without
descent
to
a
gross
falsehood
in
his
proper
person
have
moved
the
affections
by
this
mediation
to
the
just
point
note

these
trifling
contradictions
do
not
suffice
to
impugn
the
unity
of
the
high
gods
in
things
of
great
importance
they
still
appear
unanimous
consider
that
glorious
fabric

stamped
with
one
conception

must
have
methinks
the
advantage

they
are
equal
might
they
not
have
risen
in
opposition
to
the
work
and
being
all

to
our
author
here
have
still
destroyed

perceive
in
your
relation
that
either
has
the
right
to
satisfaction
from
the
other
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
to
leave
you
note
well
omit
cj
forman
lelio
under
this
condition
then
i
will
relate
the
cause
and
you
will
cede
and
must
confess
the
impossibility
of
compromise
for
the
same
lady
is
beloved
by
floro
and
myself
floro
it
seems
much
to
me
that
the
light
of
day
should
look
upon
that
idol
of
my
heart
but
he
leave
us
to
fight
according
to
thy
word
cyprian
permit
one
question
further
is
the
lady
impossible
to
hope
or
not
lelio
she
is
so
excellent
that
if
the
light
of
day
should
excite
floro
jealousy
it
were
without
just
cause
for
even
the
light
of
day
trembles
to
gaze
on
her
cyprian
would
you
for
your
part
marry
her
floro
such
is
my
confidence
cyprian
and
you
lelio
oh
would
that
i
could
lift
my
hope
so
high
for
though
she
is
extremely
poor
her
virtue
is
her
dowry
cyprian
and
if
you
both
would
marry
her
is
it
not
weak
and
vain
culpable
and
unworthy
thus
beforehand
to
slur
her
honour
what
would
the
world
say
if
one
should
slay
the
other
and
if
she
should
afterwards
espouse
the
murderer
the
rivals
agree
to
refer
their
quarrel
to
cyprian
who
in
consequence
visits
justina
and
becomes
enamoured
of
her
she
disdains
him
and
he
retires
to
a
solitary
scene
cyprian
o
memory
permit
it
not
that
the
tyrant
of
my
thought
be
another
soul
that
still
holds
dominion
the
will
that
would
refuse
but
can
no
more
to
bend
to
tremble
and
adore
vain
idolatry
i
saw
and
gazing
became
blind
with
error
weak
ambition
which
the
awe
of
her
presence
bound
to
terror
so
beautiful
she
was
and
i
between
my
love
and
jealousy
am
so
convulsed
with
hope
and
fear
unworthy
as
it
may
appear
so
bitter
is
the
life
i
live
that
hear
me
hell
i
now
would
give
to
thy
most
detested
spirit
my
soul
for
ever
to
inherit
to
suffer
punishment
and
pine
so
this
woman
may
be
mine

thou

the
melancholy
form
of
a
great
ship
the
outcast
of
the
sea
drives
miserably
and
it
must
fly
the
pity
of
the
port
or
perish
and
its
last
and
sole
resort
is
its

enemy
the
terror

a
fatal
prophecy
of

that
they

the

like

it
was
essential
to

to
wake
a

on

that
in

i
might
at
length
wipe
out
the
blot
of
the
discomfiture
sustained
upon
the
mountain
and
assail
with
a
new
war
the

from

never

no

can
my

daemon
because
my
happiness
is
lost
yet
i
lament
what
has
long
ceased
to
be
the
object
of
desire
or
memory
and
my
life
is
not
life
cyprian
now
since
the
fury
of
this
earthquaking
hurricane
is
still
and
the
crystalline
heaven
has
reassumed
its
windless
calm
so
quickly
that
it
seems
as
if
its
heavy
wrath
had
been
awakened
only
to
overwhelm
that
vessel
speak
who
art
thou
and
whence
comest
thou
daemon
far
more
my
coming
hither
cost
than
thou
hast
seen
or
i
can
tell
among
my
misadventures
this
shipwreck
is
the
least
wilt
thou
hear
cyprian
speak
daemon
since
thou
desirest
i
will
then
unveil
myself
to
thee
for
in
myself
i
am
a
world
of
happiness
and
misery
this
i
have
lost
and
that
i
must
lament
forever
in
my
attributes
i
stood
so
high
and
so
heroically
great
in
lineage
so
supreme
and
with
a
genius
which
penetrated
with
a
glance
the
world
beneath
my
feet
that
won
by
my
high
merit
a
king
whom
i
may
call
the
king
of
kings
because
all
others
tremble
in
their
pride
before
the
terrors
of
his
countenance
in
his
high
palace
roofed
with
brightest
gems
of
living
light
call
them
the
stars
of
heaven
named
me
his
counsellor
but
the
high
praise
stung
me
with
pride
and
envy
and
i
rose
in
mighty
competition
to
ascend
his
seat
and
place
my
foot
triumphantly
upon
his
subject
thrones
chastised
i
know
the
depth
to
which
ambition
falls
too
mad
was
the
attempt
and
yet
more
mad
were
now
repentance
of
the
irrevocable
deed
therefore
i
chose
this
ruin
with
the
glory
of
not
to
be
subdued
before
the
shame
of
reconciling
me
with
him
who
reigns
by
coward
nor
was
i
alone
nor
am
i
now
nor
shall
i
be
alone
and
there
was
hope
and
there
may
still
be
hope
for
many
suffrages
among
his
vassals
hailed
me
their
lord
and
king
and
many
still
are
mine
and
many
more
perchance
shall
be
thus
vanquished
though
in
fact
victorious
i
left
his
seat
of
empire
from
mine
eye
shooting
forth
poisonous
lightning
while
my
words
with
inauspicious
thunderings
shook
heaven
proclaiming
vengeance
public
as
my
wrong
and
imprecating
on
his
prostrate
slaves
rapine
and
death
and
outrage
then
i
sailed
over
the
mighty
fabric
of
the
world
a
pirate
ambushed
in
its
pathless
sands
a
lynx
crouched
watchfully
among
its
caves
and
craggy
shores
and
i
have
wandered
over
the
expanse
of
these
wide
wildernesses
in
this
great
ship
whose
bulk
is
now
dissolved
in
the
light
breathings
of
the
invisible
wind
and
which
the
sea
has
made
a
dustless
ruin
seeking
ever
a
mountain
through
whose
forests
i
seek
a
man
whom
i
must
now
compel
to
keep
his
word
with
me
i
came
arrayed
in
tempest
and
although
my
power
could
well
bridle
the
forest
winds
in
their
career
for
other
causes
i
forbore
to
soothe
their
fury
to
favonian
gentleness
i
could
and
would
not
aside
thus
i
wake
in
him
a
love
of

not
this
tempest
nor
the
succeeding

excite
thy
wonder

by

fear

owning
thyself
subdued

since
thou
thus
findest
defence
in

i
will
assume
a
feigned
form
and
thus
make
thee
a
victim
of
my
baffled
rage
for
i
will
mask
a
spirit
in
thy
form
who
will
betray
thy
name
to
infamy

doubly
shall
i
triumph
in
thy
loss
first
by
dishonouring
thee

then
by
turning
false

i
appeal
to

against
thee
so
that
heaven
may
scatter
thy

the
blot
upon

vanish
in
idle

did
not

now
stand
here
before
me
no

i

it

bosom
my

was
torn
in
fragments
ay
some
mortal
spell
is
wrought
against
my
frame
so
potent
was
the
charm
that
had
not
god
shielded
my
humble
innocence
from
wrong
i
should
have
sought
my
sorrow
and
my
shame
with
willing
livia
quick
bring
my
cloak
for
i
must
seek
refuge
from
these
extremes
even
in
the

justina
putting

in

i
burn
wasting
away
lisander
and
i
will
go
with
thee

when
i
once
see
them
safe
out

nothing

keeps
the

as
wonderful
as
on

a
little
better
would
he
live
hadst
thou
not
given
him
a
glimpse
of
heaven
light
which
he
calls
reason
and
employs
it
only
to
live
more
beastlily
than
any
beast
with
reverence
to
your
lordship
be
it
spoken
he
like
one
of
those
grasshoppers
who
flits
and
jumps
about
and
sings
for
ever
the

old
song

the

have
you
no
more

do
you
come
here
always
to
scold
and
cavil
and
complain
seems
nothing
ever
right
to
you
on

mephistopheles
no
lord
i
find
all
there
as
ever
bad
at
best
even
i
am
sorry
for
man
days
of
sorrow
i
could
myself
almost
give
up
the
pleasure
of
plaguing
the
poor
things
the
lord
knowest
thou
faust
mephistopheles
the
doctor
the
lord
ay
my
servant
faust
mephistopheles
in
truth
he
serves
you
in
a
fashion
quite
his
own
and
the
fool
meat
and
drink
are
not
of
earth
his
aspirations
bear
him
on
so
far
that
he
is
half
aware
of
his
own
folly
for
he
demands
from
heaven
its
fairest
star
and
from
the
earth
the
highest
joy
it
bears
yet
all
things
far
and
all
things
near
are
vain
to
calm
the
deep
emotions
of
his
breast
the
lord
though
he
now
serves
me
in
a
cloud
of
error
i
will
soon
lead
him
forth
to
the
clear
day
when
trees
look
green
full
well
the
gardener
knows
that
fruits
and
blooms
will
deck
the
coming
year
mephistopheles
what
will
you
bet
now
am
sure
of
winning
only
observe
you
give
me
full
permission
to
lead
him
softly
on
my
path
the
lord
as
long
as
he
shall
live
upon
the
earth
so
long
is
nothing
unto
thee
forbidden
man
must
err
till
he
has
ceased
to
struggle
mephistopheles
thanks
and
that
is
all
i
ask
for
willingly
i
never
make
acquaintance
with
the
dead
the
full
fresh
cheeks
of
youth
are
food
for
me
and
if
a
corpse
knocks
i
am
not
at
home
for
i
am
like
a
cat
i
like
to
play
a
little
with
the
mouse
before
i
eat
it
the
lord
well
well
it
is
permitted
thee
draw
thou
his
spirit
from
its
springs
as
thou
power
seize
him
and
lead
him
on
thy
downward
path
and
stand
ashamed
when
failure
teaches
thee
that
a
good
man
even
in
his
darkest
longings
is
well
aware
of
the
right
way
mephistopheles
well
and
good
i
am
not
in
much
doubt
about
my
bet
and
if
i
lose
then
is
your
turn
to
crow
enjoy
your
triumph
then
with
a
full
breast
ay
dust
shall
he
devour
and
that
with
pleasure
like
my
old
paramour
the
famous
snake
the
lord
pray
come
here
when
it
suits
you
for
i
never
had
much
dislike
for
people
of
your
sort
and
among
all
the
spirits
who
rebelled
the
knave
was
ever
the
least
tedious
to
me
the
active
spirit
of
man
soon
sleeps
and
soon
he
seeks
unbroken
quiet
therefore
i
have
given
him
the
devil
for
a
companion
who
may
provoke
him
to
some
sort
of
work
and
must
create
but
ye
pure
children
of
god

eternal
beauty

that
which
ever
operates
and
lives
clasp
you

the

creep
along

wonder
from

point
how
mammon
glows
among
the

faust
ay
and
strangely
through
the
solid
depth
below
a
melancholy
light
like
the
red
dawn
shoots
from

the
abyss
of

hitherward
there
rise
pillars

smoke
here

float
gently
by
here
the
light
burns
soft
as
the
enkindled
air
or
the
illumined
dust
of
golden
flowers
and
now
it
glides
like
tender
colours
spreading
and
now
bursts
forth
in
fountains
from
the
earth
and
now
it
winds
one
torrent
of
broad
light
through
the
far
valley
with
a
hundred
veins
and
now
once
more
within
that
narrow
corner
masses
itself
into
intensest
splendour
and
near
us
see
sparks
spring
out
of
the
ground
like
golden
sand
scattered
upon
the
darkness

pinnacles
of

black
wall

us
in

not
sir
mammon
gloriously
illuminate
his
palace
for
this
festival
it
is
a
pleasure
which
you
had
not
known
before
i
spy
the
boisterous
guests
already
faust
how
the
children
of
the
wind
rage
in
the
air
with
what
fierce
strokes
they
fall
upon
my
neck
note
how
now
mephistopheles
cling
tightly
to
the
old
ribs
of
the
crag
beware
for
if
with
them
thou
warrest
in
their
fierce
flight
towards
the
wilderness
their
breath
will
sweep
thee
into
dust
and
drag
thy
body
to
a
grave
in
the

around

leaning
graceful
from

long
did
she
gaze
and
silently
upon
the
slumbering
maid
oh
not
the
visioned
poet
in
his
dreams
when
silvery
clouds
float
through
the
brain
when
every
sight
of
lovely
wild
and
grand
astonishes
enraptures
elevates
when
fancy
at
a
glance
combines
the
wondrous
and
the
beautiful
so
bright
so
fair
so
wild
a
shape
hath
ever
yet
beheld
as
that
which
reined
the
coursers
of
the
air
and
poured
the
magic
of
her
gaze
upon
the
maiden
sleep
the
broad
and
yellow
moon
shone
dimly
through
her
form
that
form

the

the

that
filled
the

mild

powerful
as
that
which
bursting
from

spread
a
purpureal
halo
round
the

yet
with
an
undulating
motion
swayed
to
her
outline
gracefully
from
her
celestial

the

descended

thrice
she
waved

the

proceeded
the

disparted
and
as
the
car
of
magic
they
ascended
again
the
speechless
music
swelled
again
the
coursers
of
the
air
unfurled
their
azure
pennons
and
the
queen
shaking
the
beamy
reins
bade
them
pursue
their

the

moved
on
the
night
was
fair
and
countless
stars
studded

dark

just
the

wave
peeped
the

faint
smile
of

the

moved
on
from
the
celestial
hoofs
the
atmosphere
in
flaming
sparkles
flew
and
where
the
burning
wheels
eddied
above
the
mountain
loftiest
peak
was
traced
a
line
of
lightning
now
it
flew
far
above
a
rock
the
utmost
verge
of
earth
the
rival
of
the
andes
whose
dark
brow
lowered
the
silver
sea
far
far
below
the
chariot
path
calm
as
a
slumbering
babe
tremendous
ocean
lay
the
mirror
of
its
stillness
showed
the
pale
and
waning
stars
the
chariot
fiery
track
and
the
gray
light
of
morn
tinging
those
fleecy
clouds
that
canopied
the
dawn
seemed
it
that
the
chariot
way
lay
through
the
midst
of
an
immense
concave
radiant
with
million
constellations
tinged
with
shades
of
infinite
colour
and
semicircled
with
a
belt
flashing
incessant
meteors
the
magic
car
moved
on
as
they
approached
their
goal
the
coursers
seemed
to
gather
speed
the
sea
no

was
distinguished
earth
appeared
a
vast
and
shadowy
sphere
the
sun
unclouded
orb
rolled
through
the
black
concave
its
rays
of
rapid
light
parted
around
the
chariot
swifter
course
and
fell
like
ocean
feathery
spray
dashed
from
the
boiling
surge
before
a
vessel
prow
the
magic
car
moved
on
earth
distant
orb
appeared
the
smallest
light
that
twinkles
in
the
heaven
whilst
round
the
chariot
way
innumerable
systems
rolled
and
countless
spheres
diffused
an
glory
it
was
a
sight
of
wonder
some
were
horned
like
the
crescent
moon
some
shed
a
mild
and
silver
beam
like
hesperus
the
western
sea
some
dashed
athwart
with
trains
of
flame
like
worlds
to
death
and
ruin
driven
some
shone
like
suns
and
as
the
chariot
passed
eclipsed
all
other
light
spirit
of
nature
here
in
this
interminable
wilderness
of
worlds
at
whose
immensity
even
soaring

staggers
here
is

temple
yet
not
the

leaf
that
quivers
to
the
passing

less

with
thee
yet
not
the

worm
that
lurks
in
graves
and
fattens
on
the
dead
less
shares
thy
eternal
breath
spirit
of

thou
imperishable
as
this
scene
here
is
thy
fitting
temple
if
solitude
hath
ever
led
thy
steps
to
the
wild
ocean
echoing
shore
and
thou
hast
lingered
there
until
the
sun
broad
orb
seemed
resting
on
the
burnished
wave
thou
must
have
marked
the
lines
of
purple
gold
that
motionless
hung
the
sinking
sphere
thou
must
have
marked
the
billowy
clouds
edged
with
intolerable
radiancy
towering
like
rocks
of
jet
crowned
with
a
diamond
wreath
and
yet
there
is
a
moment
when
the
sun
highest
point
peeps
like
a
star
ocean
western
edge
when
those
far
clouds
of
feathery
gold
shaded
with
deepest
purple
gleam
like
islands
on
a
dark
blue
sea
then
has
thy
fancy
soared
above
the
earth
and
furled
its
wearied
wing
within
the
fairy
fane
yet
not
the
golden
islands
gleaming
in
yon
flood
of
light
nor
the
feathery
curtains
stretching
the
sun
bright
couch
nor
the
burnished

fair
so

spread
its
floors
of
flashing
light
its
vast
and
azure
dome
its
fertile
golden
islands
floating
on
a
silver
sea
whilst
suns
their
mingling
beamings
darted
through
clouds
of
circumambient
darkness
and
pearly
battlements
around
looked
the
immense
of
heaven
the
magic
car
no
longer
moved
the
fairy
and
the
spirit
entered
the
hall
of
spells
those
golden
clouds
that
rolled
in
glittering
billows
beneath
the
azure
canopy
with
the
aethereal
footsteps

ten

scarcely

in
the
waste
where
now
the

drinks
his
enemy
blood
and
aping

wakes
the
unholy
song
of

arose
a
stately
city

the
western

there
now
the
mossy
indented
by

once
appeared
to

all

its

there
the
wide

rude
in
the
uncultivated
loveliness
of

long
run
wild
seems
to
the
unwilling
sojourner
whose
steps
chance
in
that
desert
has
delayed
thus
to
have
stood
since
earth
was
what
it
is
yet
once
it
was
the

haunt
whither
as
to
a
common
centre
flocked
strangers
and
ships

that

a

a

gloomy

thou

fatherless

groans
of

the

to
abjectness
the
fool

courtiers
nickname

a

even

that
man
heeds
not
the
shriek
of
penury
he
smiles
at
the
deep
curses
which
the
destitute
mutter
in
secret
and
a
sullen
joy
pervades
his
bloodless
heart
when
thousands
groan
but
for
those
morsels
which
his
wantonness
wastes
in
unjoyous
revelry
to
save
all
that
they
love
from
famine
when
he
hears
the
tale
of
horror
to
some
face
of
hypocritical
assent
he
turns
smothering
the
glow
of
shame
that
spite
of
him
flushes
his
bloated
cheek
now
to
the
meal
of
silence
grandeur
and
excess
he
drags
his
palled
unwilling
appetite
if
gold
gleaming
around
and
numerous
viands
culled
from
every
clime
could
force
the
loathing
sense
to
overcome
satiety
if
wealth
the
spring
it
draws
from
poisons
not
or

unfeeling
stubborn
vice
converteth
not
its

then
that

at

her
welcome

not

behold
him
now
stretched
on
the
gorgeous
couch
his
fevered
brain
reels
dizzily
awhile
but
ah
too
soon
the
slumber
of
intemperance
subsides
and

that
undying
serpent
calls
her
venomous
brood
to

oh

oh

upon

the

that

is
the

and

defileth
not
her
snowy

in
such
a

as
thine
hark
yet
he

his
slumbers
are
but
varied
agonies
they
prey
like
scorpions
on

there
needeth
not

hell
that
bigots

to
punish
those
who
err
earth
in

contains
at

the

chastise
those
who
transgress
her
law
she
only
knows
how
justly
to
proportion
to
the
fault
the
punishment
it
merits
is
it
strange
that
this
poor
wretch
should
pride
him
in
his
woe
take
pleasure
in
his
abjectness
and
hug
the
scorpion
that
consumes
him
is
it
strange
that
placed
on
a
conspicuous
throne
of
thorns
grasping
an
iron
sceptre
and
immured
within
a
splendid
prison
whose
stern
bounds
shut
him
from
all
that
good

his
soul
asserts
not
its
humanity
that

rises
not
in

against

employ
no
is
not
strange
he
like
the
vulgar
thinks

and
lives
just
as
his

did
the
unconquered
powers
of

and
custom
interpose
between

it

him
from

and
yon
squalid
form
leaner

in

drags
out
in

a

to

many

bursts

morn
dawns
on
the

the

rolls
away

along

that

in

yet
still
thy
youthful
hands
were
pure
of
human
blood
then
manhood
gave
its
strength
and
ardour
to
thy
frenzied
brain
thine
eager
gaze
scanned
the
stupendous
scene
whose
wonders
mocked
the
knowledge
of
thy
pride
their
everlasting
and
unchanging
laws
reproached
thine
ignorance
awhile
thou
stoodst
baffled
and
gloomy
then
thou
didst
sum
up
the
elements
of
all
that
thou
didst
know
the
changing
seasons
winter
leafless
reign
the
budding
of
the
trees
the
eternal
orbs
that
beautify
the
night
the
sunrise
and
the
setting
of
the
moon
earthquakes
and
wars
and
poisons
and
disease
and
all
their
causes
to
an
abstract
point
converging
thou
didst
bend
and
called
it
god
the
the
omnipotent
the
merciful
and
the
avenging
god
who
prototype
of
human
misrule
sits
high
in
heaven
realm
upon
a
golden
throne
even
like
an
earthly
king
and
whose
dread
work
hell
gapes
for
ever
for
the
unhappy
slaves
of
fate
whom
he
created
in
his
sport
to
triumph
in
their
torments
when
they
fell
earth
heard
the
name
earth
trembled
as
the
smoke
of
his
revenge
ascended
up
to
heaven
blotting
the
constellations
and
the
cries
of
millions
butchered
in
sweet
confidence
and
unsuspecting
peace
even
when
the
bonds
of
safety
were
confirmed
by
wordy
oaths
sworn
in
his
dreadful
name
rung
through
the
land
whilst
innocent
babes
writhed
on
thy
stubborn
spear
and
thou
didst
laugh
to
hear
the
mother
shriek
of
maniac
gladness
as
the
sacred
steel
felt
cold
in
her
torn
entrails
thou
wert
then
in
manhood
prime
but
age
crept
on
one
god
would
not
suffice
for
senile
puerility
thou
framedst
a
tale
to
suit
thy
dotage
and
to
glut
thy
soul
that
the
mad
fiend
thy
wickedness
had
pictured
might
afford
a
plea
for
sating
the
unnatural
thirst
for
murder
rapine
violence
and
crime
that
still
consumed
thy
being
even
when
thou
heardst
the
step
of
fate
that
flames
might
light
thy
funeral
scene
and
the
shrill
horrent
shrieks
of
parents
dying
on
the
pile
that
burned
to
light
their
children
to
thy
paths
the
roar
of
the
encircling
flames
the
exulting
cries
of
thine
apostles
loud
commingling
there
might
sate
thine
hungry
ear
even
on
the
bed
of
death
now
contempt
is
mocking
thy
gray
hairs
thou
art
descending
to
the
darksome
grave
unhonoured
and
unpitied
but
by
those
whose
pride
is
passing
by
like
thine
and
sheds
like
thine
a
glare
that
fades
before
the
sun
of
truth
and
shines
but
in
the
dreadful
night
that
long
has
lowered
above
the
ruined
world
these
infinite
orbs
of
mingling
light
of
which
yon
earth
is
one
is
wide
diffused
a
spirit
of
activity
and
life
that
knows
no
term
cessation
or
decay
that
fades
not
when
the
lamp
of
earthly
life
extinguished
in
the
dampness
of
the
grave
awhile
there
slumbers
more
than
when
the
babe
in
the
dim
newness
of
its
being
feels
the
impulses
of
sublunary
things
and
all
is
wonder
to
unpractised
sense

active
steadfast
and
eternal
still

health
and

and
in
the
storm
of
change
that
ceaselessly
rolls
round
the
eternal
universe
and
shakes
its
undecaying
battlement
presides
apportioning
with
irresistible
law
the
place
each
spring
of
its
machine
shall
fill
so
that
when
waves
on

tumultuous
heap
confusion
to
the

heaven
lightnings
scorch
the
uprooted
whilst
to
the
eye

shipwrecked
mariner
lone
sitting
on

all
seems
unlinked
contingency

no

of
this

as
it

even
the

almighty
one
i
tremble
and
obey
spirit
centuries
have
set
their
seal
on
this
heart
of
many
wounds
and
loaded
brain
since
the
incarnate
came
humbly
he
came
veiling
his
horrible
godhead
in
the
shape
of
man
scorned
by
the
world
his
name
unheard
save
by
the
rabble
of
his
native
town
even
as
a
parish
demagogue
he
led
the
crowd
he
taught
them
justice
truth
and
peace
in
semblance
but
he
lit
within
their
souls
the
quenchless
flames
of
zeal
and
blessed
the
sword
he
brought
on
earth
to
satiate
with
the
blood
of
truth
and
freedom
his
malignant
soul
at
length
his
mortal
frame
was
led
to
death
i
stood
beside
him
on
the
torturing
cross
no
pain
assailed
his
unterrestrial
sense
and
yet
he
groaned
indignantly
i
summed
the
massacres
and
miseries
which
his
name
had
sanctioned
in
my
country
and
i
cried
go
go
in
mockery
a
smile
of
godlike
malice
reillumed
his
fading
i
go
he
cried
but
thou
shalt
wander
the
unquiet
earth
eternally
the
dampness
of
the
grave
bathed
my
imperishable
front
i
fell
and
long
lay
tranced
upon
the
charmed
soil
when
i
awoke
hell
burned
within
my
brain
which
staggered
on
its
seat
for
all
around
the
mouldering
relics
of
my
kindred
lay
even
as
the
almighty
ire
arrested
them
and
in
their
various
attitudes
of
death
my
murdered
children
mute
and
eyeless
skulls
glared
ghastily
upon
me
but
my
soul
from
sight
and
sense
of
the
polluting
woe
of
tyranny
had
long
learned
to
prefer
hell
freedom
to
the
servitude
of
heaven
therefore
i
rose
and
dauntlessly
began
my
lonely
and
unending
pilgrimage
resolved
to
wage
unweariable
war
with
my
almighty
tyrant
and
to
hurl
defiance
at
his
impotence
to
harm
beyond
the
curse
i
bore
the
very
hand
that
barred
my
passage
to
the
peaceful
grave
has
crushed
the
earth
to
misery
and
given
its
empire
to
the
chosen
of
his
slaves
these
have
i
seen
even
from
the
earliest
dawn
of
weak
unstable
and
precarious
power
then
preaching
peace
as
now
they
practise
war
so
when
they
turned
but
from
the
massacre
of
unoffending
infidels
to
quench
their
thirst
for
ruin
in
the
very
blood
that
flowed
in
their
own
veins
and
pitiless
zeal
froze
every
human
feeling
as
the
wife
sheathed
in
her
husband
heart
the
sacred
steel
even
whilst
its
hopes
were
dreaming
of
her
love
and
friends
to
friends
brothers
to
brothers
stood
opposed
in
bloodiest
and
war
scarce
satiable
by
fate
last
waged
drunk
from
the
winepress
of
the
almighty
wrath
whilst
the
red
cross
in
mockery
of
peace
pointed
to
victory
when
the
fray
was
done
no
remnant
of
the
exterminated
faith
survived
to
tell
its
ruin
but
the
flesh
with
putrid
smoke
poisoning
the
atmosphere
that
rotted
on
the
pile
i
have
seen
god
worshippers
unsheathe
the
sword
of
his
revenge
when
grace
descended
confirming
all
unnatural
impulses
to
sanctify
their
desolating
deeds
and
frantic
priests
waved
the
cross
the
unhappy
earth
then
shone
the
sun
on
showers
of
gore
from
the
upflashing
steel
of
safe
assassination
and
all
crime
made
stingless
by
the
spirits
of
the
lord
and
rainbows
canopied
the
land
no
year
of
my
eventful
being
has
passed
unstained
by
crime
and
misery
which
flows
from
god
own
faith
i
marked
his
slaves
with
tongues
whose
lies
are
venomous
beguile
the
insensate
mob
and
whilst
one
hand
was
red
with
murder
feign
to
stretch
the
other
out
for
brotherhood
and
peace
and
that
they
now
babble
of
love
and
mercy
whilst
their
deeds
are
marked
with
all
the
narrowness
and
crime
that
freedom
young
arm
dare
not
yet
chastise

claim
our
gratitude
who
now
establishing
the
imperishable
throne
of
truth
and
stubborn
virtue
maketh
vain
the
unprevailing
malice
of
my
foe
whose
bootless
rage
heaps
torments
for
the
brave
adds
impotent
eternities
to
pain
whilst
keenest
disappointment
racks
his
breast
to
see
the
smiles
of
peace
around
them
play
to
frustrate
or
to
sanctify
their
doom
have
i
stood
through
a
wild
waste
of
years
struggling
with
whirlwinds
of
mad
agony
yet
peaceful
and
serene
and
mocking
my
powerless
tyrant
horrible
curse
with
stubborn
and
unalterable
will
even
as
a
giant
oak
which
heaven
fierce
flame
had
scathed
in
the
wilderness
to
stand
a
monument
of
fadeless
ruin
there
yet
peacefully
and
movelessly
it
braves
the
midnight
conflict
of
the
wintry
storm
as
in
the
sunlight
calm
it
spreads
its
worn
and
withered
arms
on
high
to
meet
the
quiet
of
a
summer
noon
the

there
catching

those

snowstorms
round

round

vast
solitude
bound

broad
zone
of

are
unloosed
and
fragrant
zephyrs
there
from
spicy
isles
ruffle
the
placid
that
rolls
its
broad
bright
surges
to
the
sloping
sand
whose
roar
is
wakened
into
echoings
sweet
to
murmur
through

melodize
with

nature
there
deserts
of

sand
whose
fervours

bird
to
live
a
blade
of

to
spring
where
the
shrill
chirp
of
the
green
lizard

broke
on
the
sultry
silentness

now
teem
with
countless
rills
and
shady
woods
cornfields
and
pastures
and
white
cottages
and
where
the
startled
wilderness
beheld
a
savage
conqueror
stained
in
kindred
blood
a
tigress
sating
with
the
flesh
of
lambs
the
unnatural
famine
of
her
toothless
cubs
whilst
shouts
and
howlings
through
the
desert
rang
sloping
and
smooth
the
lawn
offering
sweet
incense
to
the
sunrise
smiles
to
see
a
babe
before
his
mother
door
sharing
his
morning
meal
with
the
green
and
golden
basilisk
that
comes
to
lick
his
feet
trackless
deeps
where
many
a
weary
sail
has
seen
above
the
illimitable
plain
morning
on
night
and
night
on
morning
rise
whilst
still
no
land
to
greet
the
wanderer
spread
its
shadowy
mountains
on
the
sea
where
the
loud
roarings
of
the
so
long
have
mingled
with
the
gusty
wind
in
melancholy
loneliness
and
swept
the
desert
of
those
ocean
solitudes
but
vocal
to
the
harrowing
shriek
the
bellowing
monster
and
the
rushing
storm
now
to
the

impulses
respond
those
lonely
realms
bright

with
lightsome

on

the

a
feverish
dream

stagnant
woe
whose
meagre
wants

scantily
fulfilled
apprised
him
ever
of
the
joyless
length

bound
the

with

broad
belt
of
mingling
cloud
and
flame
where
blue
mists
through
the
unmoving

crushed
him
to

bloodstained

bartered
for
the

of
power
which
all
internal
impulses
destroying
makes
human

was
changed
with

dragged
to
distant

burning
sun

kings
first
leagued

the

begat

it

add
a

its

constituent
is
obedience
a
soldier
is
of
all
descriptions
of
men
the
most
completely
a
machine
yet
his
profession
inevitably
teaches
him
something
of
dogmatism
swaggering
and
he
is
like
the
puppet
of
a
showman
who
at
the

he

that

wantonly
depriving

that

by
so
much
would
the

more
vehement

the

the

which
seduction

the

resolving

this
the

in
acrimony
and
all
the
little
tyrannies
of
domestic
life
when
they

that
their
victim
is
without
appeal
if
this
connection
were
put
on
a
rational
basis
each
would
be
assured
that
habitual
would
terminate
in
separation

would
check
this
vicious

dangerous
propensity

chastity
is
a
monkish

superstition
a
greater
foe
to

temperance
even
than
unintellectual
sensuality
it
strikes
at
the
root
of
all
domestic
happiness
and
consigns
more
than
half
of
the
human
race
to
misery
that
some
few
may
monopolize
according
to

a
system
could
not
well
have
been
devised
more
studiously
hostile
to
human
happiness
than
marriage
i
conceive
that
from
the
abolition
of
marriage
the
fit
and
natural
arrangement
of
sexual
connection
would
result
i
by
no
means
assert
that
the
intercourse
would
be
promiscuous
on
the
contrary
it
appears
from
the
relation
of
parent
to
child
that
this
union
is
generally
of
long
duration
and
marked
above
all
others
with
generosity
and
but
this
is
a
subject
which
it
is
perhaps
premature
to
discuss
that
which
will
result
from
the
abolition
of
marriage
will
be
natural
and
right
because
choice
and
change
will
be
exempted
from
restraint
in
fact
religion
and
morality
as
they
now
stand

a
practical
code

accursed

would

which

it
is
exceedingly
probable
from
many
considerations
that
this
obliquity
will
gradually
diminish

the

the

then
become
equal
on

throughout

probably

there
is
no
great
extravagance
in
presuming
that
the
progress

the
perpendicularity
of

may
be
as
rapid
as
the
progress
of

or
that
there
should
be
a
perfect
identity
between
the

it

that

not

necessity
thou
mother
of

world
he
who
asserts
the
doctrine
of
necessity
means
that
contemplating
the
events
which
compose
the
moral
and
material
universe
he
beholds
only
an
immense
and
uninterrupted
chain
of
causes
and
effects
no
one
of
which
could
occupy
any
other
place
than
it
does
occupy
or
act
in
any
other
place
than
it
does
act
the
idea
of
necessity
is
obtained
by
our
experience
of
the
connection
between
objects
the
uniformity
of
the
operations
of
nature
the
constant
conjunction
of
similar
events
and
the
consequent
inference
of
one
from
the
other
mankind
are
therefore
agreed
in
the
admission
of
necessity
if
they
admit
that
these
two
circumstances
take
place
in
voluntary
action
motive
is
to
voluntary
action
in
the
human
mind
what
cause
is
to

the
word
liberty
as
applied
to
mind
is
analogous
to
the
word
chance
as
applied
to
matter
they
spring
from
an
ignorance
of
the
certainty
of
the
conjunction
of
antecedents
and
consequents
every
human
being
is
irresistibly
impelled
to
act
precisely
as
he
does
act
in
the
eternity
which
preceded
his
birth
a
chain
of
causes
was
generated
which
operating
under
the
name
of
motives
make
it
impossible
that
any
thought
of
his
mind
or
any
action
of
his
life
should
be
otherwise
than
it
is
were
the
doctrine
of
necessity
false
the
human
mind
would
no
longer
be
a
legitimate
object
of
science
from
like
causes
it
would
be
in
vain
that
we
should
expect
like
effects
the
strongest
motive
would
no
longer
be
paramount
over
the
conduct
all
knowledge
would
be
vague

undeterminate

could
not
predict
with
any
certainty
that
we
might
not
meet
as
an
enemy
him
with
whom
we
have

the
most
probable
inducements
and
the
clearest
reasonings
would
lose
the
invariable
influence
they
possess
the
contrary
of
this
is
demonstrably
the
fact
similar
circumstances
produce
the
same
unvariable
effects
the
precise
character
and
motives
of
any
man
on
any
occasion
being
given
the
moral
philosopher
could
predict
his
actions
with
as
much
certainty
as
the
natural
philosopher
could
predict
the
effects
of
the
mixture
of
any
particular
chemical
substances
why
is
the
aged
husbandman
more
experienced
than
the
young
beginner
because
there
is
a
uniform
undeniable
necessity
in
the
operations
of
the
material
universe
why
is
the
old
statesman
more
skilful
than
the
raw
politician
because
relying
on
the
necessary
conjunction
of
motive
and
action
he
proceeds
to
produce
moral
effects
by
the
application
of
those
moral
causes
which
experience
has
shown
to
be
effectual
some
actions
may
be
found
to
which
we
can
attach
no
motives
but
these
are
the
effects
of
causes
with
which
we
are
unacquainted
hence
the
relation
which
motive
bears
to
voluntary
action
is
that
of
cause
to
effect
nor
placed
in
this
point
of
view

history

whilst

scrupled
to
admit

as

many
have
disputed
its
dominion
over
mind
independently
of
its
militating
with
the
received
ideas
of
the
justice
of

it
is
by
no
means
obvious
to
a
superficial
inquiry
when
the
mind
observes
its
own
operations
it
feels
no
connection
of
motive
and
action
but
as
we
know
more
of
causation
than
the
constant
conjunction
of
objects
and
the
consequent
inference
of
one
from
the
other
as
we
find
that
these
two
circumstances
are
universally
allowed
to
have
place
in
voluntary
action
we
may
be
easily
led
to
own
that
they
are
subjected
to
the
necessity
common
to
all
causes
the
actions
of
the
will
have
a
regular
conjunction
with
circumstances
and
characters
motive
is
to
voluntary
action
what
cause
is
to
effect
but
the
only
idea
we
can
form
of
causation
is
a
constant
conjunction
of
similar
objects
and
the
consequent
inference
of
one
from
the
other
wherever
this
is
the
case
necessity
is
clearly
established
the
idea
of
liberty
applied
metaphorically
to
the
will
has
sprung
from
a
misconception
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
power
what
is
power
id
quod
potest
that
which
can
produce
any
given
effect
to
deny
power
is
to
say
that
nothing
can
or
has
the
power
to
be
or
act
in
the
only
true
sense
of
the
word
power
it
applies
with
equal
force
to
the
lodestone
as
to
the
human
will
do
you
think
these
motives
which
i
shall
present
are
powerful
enough
to
rouse
him
is
a
question
just
as
common
as
do
you
think
this
lever
has
the
power
of
raising
this
weight
the
advocates
of
assert
that
the
will
has
the
power
of
refusing
to
be
determined
by
the
strongest
motive
but
the
strongest
motive
is
that
which
overcoming
all
others
ultimately
prevails
this
assertion
therefore
amounts
to
a
denial
of
the
will
being
ultimately
determined
by
that
motive
which
does
determine
it
which
is
absurd
but
it
is
equally
certain
that
a
man
can
not
resist
the
strongest
motive
as
that
he
can
not
overcome
a
physical
impossibility
the
doctrine
of
necessity
tends
to
introduce
a
great
change
into
the
established
notions
of
morality
and
utterly
to
destroy
religion
reward
and
punishment
must
be
considered
by
the
necessarian
merely
as
motives
which
he
would
employ
in
order
to
procure
the
adoption
or
abandonment
of
any
given
line
of
conduct
desert
in
the
present
sense
of
the
word
would
no
longer
have
any
meaning
and
he
who
should
inflict
pain
upon
another
for
no
better
reason
than
that
he
deserved
it
would
only
gratify
his
revenge
under
pretence
of
satisfying
justice
it
is
not
enough
says
the
advocate
of
that
a
criminal
should
be
prevented
from
a
repetition
of
his
crime
he
should
feel
pain
and
his
torments
when
justly
inflicted
ought
precisely
to
be
proportioned
to
his
fault
but
utility
is
morality
that
which
is
incapable
of
producing
happiness
is
useless
and
though
the
crime
of
damiens
must
be
condemned
yet
the
frightful
torments
which
revenge
under
the
name
of
justice
inflicted
on
this
unhappy
man
can
not
be
supposed
to
have
augmented
even
at
the
long
run
the
stock
of
pleasurable
sensation
in
the
world
at
the
same
time
the
doctrine
of
necessity
does
not
in
the
least
diminish
our
disapprobation
of
vice
the
conviction
which
all
feel
that
a
viper
is
a
poisonous
animal
and
that
a
tiger
is
constrained
by
the
inevitable
condition
of
his
existence
to
devour
men
does
not
induce
us
to
avoid
them
lass
sedulously
or
even
more
to
hesitate
in
destroying
them
but
he
would
surely
be
of
a
hard
heart
who
meeting
with
a
serpent
on
a
desert
island
or
in
a
situation
where
it
was
incapable
of
injury
should
wantonly
deprive
it
of
existence
a
necessarian
is
inconsequent
to
his
own
principles
if
he
indulges
in
hatred
or
contempt
the
compassion
which
he
feels
for
the
criminal
is
unmixed
with
a
desire
of
injuring
him
he
looks
with
an
elevated
and
dreadless
composure
upon
the
links
of
the
universal
chain
as
they
pass
before
his
eyes
whilst
cowardice
curiosity
and
inconsistency
only
assail
him
in
proportion
to
the
feebleness
and
indistinctness
with
which
he
has
perceived
and
rejected
the
delusions
of
religion
is
the
perception
of
the
relation
in
which
we
stand
to
the
principle
of
the
universe
but
if
the
principle
of
the
universe
be
not
an
organic
being
the
model
and
prototype
of
man
the
relation
between
it
and
human
beings
is
absolutely
none
without
some
insight
into
its
will
respecting
our
actions
religion
is
nugatory
and
vain
but
will
is
only
a
mode
of
animal
mind
moral
qualities
also
are
such
as
only
a
human
being
can
possess
to
attribute
them
to
the
principle
of
the
universe
is
to
annex
to
it
properties
incompatible
with
any
possible
definition
of
its
nature
it
is
probable
that
the
word
god
was
originally
only
an
expression
denoting
the
unknown
cause
of
the
known
events
which
men
perceived
in
the
universe
by
the
vulgar
mistake
of
a
metaphor
for
a
real
being
of
a
word
for
a
thing
it
became
a
man
endowed
with
human
qualities
and
governing
the
universe
as
an
earthly
monarch
governs
his
kingdom
their
addresses
to
this
imaginary
being
indeed
are
much
in
the
same
style
as
those
of
subjects
to
a
king
they
acknowledge
his
benevolence
deprecate
his
anger
and
supplicate
his
favour
but
the
doctrine
of
necessity
teaches
us
that
in
no
case
could
any
event
have
happened
otherwise
than
it
did
happen
and
that
if
god
is
the
author
of
good
he
is
also
the
author
of
evil
that
if
he
is
entitled
to
our
gratitude
for
the
one
he
is
entitled
to
our
hatred
for
the
other
that
admitting
the
existence
of
this
hypothetic
being
he
is
also
subjected
to
the
dominion
of
an
immutable
necessity
it
is
plain
that
the
same
arguments
which
prove
that
god
is
the
author
of
food
light
and
life
prove
him
also
to
be
the
author
of
poison
darkness
and
death
the
earthquake
the
storm
the
battle
and
the
tyranny
are
attributable
to
this
hypothetic
being
in
the
same
degree
as
the
fairest
forms
of
nature
sunshine
liberty
and
peace
but
we
are
taught
by
the
doctrine
of
necessity
that
there
is
neither
good
nor
evil
in
the
universe
otherwise
than
as
the
events
to
which
we
apply
these
epithets
have
relation
to
our
own
peculiar
mode
of
being
still
less
than
with
the
hypothesis
of
a
god
will
the
doctrine
of
necessity
accord
with
the
belief
of
a
future
state
of
punishment
god
made
man
such
as
he
is
and
than
damned
him
for
being
so
for
to
say
that
god
was
the
author
of
all
good
and
man
the
author
of
all
evil
is
to
say
that
one
man
made
a
straight
line
and
a
crooked
one
and
another
man
made
the
incongruity
a
mahometan
story
much
to
the
present
purpose
is
recorded
wherein
adam
and
moses
are
introduced
disputing
before
god
in
the
following
manner
thou
says
moses
art
adam
whom
god
created
and
animated
with
the
breath
of
life
and
caused
to
be
worshipped
by
the
angels
and
placed
in
paradise
from
whence
mankind
have
been
expelled
for
thy
fault
whereto
adam
answered
thou
art
moses
whom
god
chose
for
his
apostle
and
entrusted
with
his
word
by
giving
thee
the
tables
of
the
law
and
whom
he
vouchsafed
to
admit
to
discourse
with
himself
how
many
years
dost
thou
find
the
law
was
written
before
i
was
created
says
moses
forty
and
dost
thou
not
find
replied
adam
these
words
therein
and
adam
rebelled
against
his
lord
and
transgressed
which
moses
confessing
dost
thou
therefore
blame
me
continued
he
for
doing
that
which
god
wrote
of
me
that
i
should
do
forty
years
before
i
was
created
nay
for
what
was
decreed
concerning
me
fifty
thousand
years
before
the
creation
of
heaven
and
earth
sale
prelim
disc
to
the
koran
page
there
is
no

this
negation
must
be
understood
solely
to
affect
a
creative
deity
the
hypothesis
of
a
pervading
spirit
with
the
universe
remains
unshaken
a
close
examination
of
the
validity
of
the
proofs
adduced
to
support
any
proposition
is
the
only
secure
way
of
attaining
truth
on
the
advantages
of
which
it
is
unnecessary
to
descant
our
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
a
deity
is
a
subject
of
such
importance
that
it
can
not
be
too
minutely
investigated
in
consequence
of
this
conviction
we
proceed
briefly
and
impartially
to
examine
the
proofs
which
have
been
adduced
it
is
necessary
first
to
consider
the
nature
of
belief
when
a
proposition
is
offered
to
the
mind
it
perceives
the
agreement
or
disagreement
of
the
ideas
of
which
it
is
composed
a
perception
of
their
agreement
is
termed
belief
many
obstacles
frequently
prevent
this
perception
from
being
immediate
these
the
mind
attempts
to
remove
in
order
that
the
perception
may
be
distinct
the
mind
is
active
in
the
investigation
in
order
to
perfect
the
state
of
perception
of
the
relation
which
the
component
ideas
of
the
proposition
bear
to
each
which
is
passive
the
investigation
being
confused
with
the
perception
has
induced
many
falsely
to
imagine
that
the
mind
is
active
in
belief
that
belief
is
an
act
of
volition
in
consequence
of
which
it
may
be
regulated
by
the
mind
pursuing
continuing
this
mistake
they
have
attached
a
degree
of
criminality
to
disbelief
of
which
in
its
nature
it
is
incapable
it
is
equally
incapable
of
merit
belief
then
is
a
passion
the
strength
of
which
like
every
other
passion
is
in
precise
proportion
to
the
degrees
of
excitement
the
degrees
of
excitement
are
three
the
senses
are
the
sources
of
all
knowledge
to
the
mind
consequently
their
evidence
claims
the
strongest
assent
the
decision
of
the
mind
founded
upon
our
own
experience
derived
from
these
sources
claims
the
next
degree
the
experience
of
others
which
addresses
itself
to
the
former
one
occupies
the
lowest
degree
a
graduated
scale
on
which
should
be
marked
the
capabilities
of
propositions
to
approach
to
the
test
of
the
senses
would
be
a
just
barometer
of
the
belief
which
ought
to
be
attached
to
them
consequently
no
testimony
can
be
admitted
which
is
contrary
to
reason
reason
is
founded
on
the
evidence
of
our
senses
every
proof
may
be
referred
to
one
of
these
three
divisions
it
is
to
be
considered
what
arguments
we
receive
from
each
of
them
which
should
convince
us
of
the
existence
of
a
deity
the
evidence
of
the
senses
if
the
deity
should
appear
to
us
if
he
should
convince
our
senses
of
his
existence
this
revelation
would
necessarily
command
belief
those
to
whom
the
deity
has
thus
appeared
have
the
strongest
possible
conviction
of
his
existence
but
the
god
of
theologians
is
incapable
of
local
visibility
reason
it
is
urged
that
man
knows
that
whatever
is
must
either
have
had
a
beginning
or
have
existed
from
all
eternity
he
also
knows
that
whatever
is
not
eternal
must
have
had
a
cause
when
this
reasoning
is
applied
to
the
universe
it
is
necessary
to
prove
that
it
was
created
until
that
is
clearly
demonstrated
we
may
reasonably
suppose
that
it
has
endured
from
all
eternity
we
must
prove
design
before
we
can
infer
a
designer
the
only
idea
which
we
can
form
of
causation
is
derivable
from
the
constant
conjunction
of
objects
and
the
consequent
inference
of
one
from
the
other
in
a
case
where
two
propositions
are
diametrically
opposite
the
mind
believes
that
which
is
least
incomprehensible
it
is
easier
to
suppose
that
the
universe
has
existed
from
all
eternity
than
to
conceive
a
being
beyond
its
limits
capable
of
creating
it
if
the
mind
sinks
beneath
the
weight
of
one
is
it
an
alleviation
to
increase
the
intolerability
of
the
burthen
the
other
argument
which
is
founded
on
a
man
knowledge
of
his
own
existence
stands
thus
a
man
knows
not
only
that
he
now
is
but
that
once
he
was
not
consequently
there
must
have
been
a
cause
but
our
idea
of
causation
is
alone
derivable
from
the
constant
conjunction
of
objects
and
the
consequent
inference
of
one
from
the
other
and
reasoning
experimentally
we
can
only
infer
from
effects
causes
exactly
adequate
to
those
effects
but
there
certainly
is
a
generative
power
which
is
effected
by
certain
instruments
we
can
not
prove
that
it
is
inherent
in
these
instruments
nor
is
the
contrary
hypothesis
capable
of
demonstration
we
admit
that
the
generative
power
is
incomprehensible
but
to
suppose
that
the
same
effect
is
produced
by
an
eternal
omniscient
omnipotent
being
leaves
the
cause
in
the
same
obscurity
but
renders
it
more
incomprehensible
testimony
it
is
required
that
testimony
should
not
be
contrary
to
reason
the
testimony
that
the
deity
convinces
the
senses
of
men
of
his
existence
can
only
be
admitted
by
us
if
our
mind
considers
it
less
probable
that
these
men
should
have
been
deceived
than
that
the
deity
should
have
appeared
to
them
our
reason
can
never
admit
the
testimony
of
men
who
not
only
declare
that
they
were
of
miracles
but
that
the
deity
was
irrational
for
he
commanded
that
he
should
be
believed
he
proposed
the
highest
rewards
for
faith
eternal
punishments
for
disbelief
we
can
only
command
voluntary
actions
belief
is
not
an
act
of
volition
the
mind
is
even
passive
or
involuntarily
active
from
this
it
is
evident
that
we
have
no
sufficient
testimony
or
rather
that
testimony
is
insufficient
to
prove
the
being
of
a
god
it
has
been
before
shown
that
it
can
not
be
deduced
from
reason
they
alone
then
who
have
been
convinced
by
the
evidence
of
the
senses
can
believe
it
hence
it
is
evident
that
having
no
proofs
from
either
of
the
three
sources
of
conviction
the
mind
can
not
believe
the
existence
of
a
creative
god
it
is
also
evident
that
as
belief
is
a
passion
of
the
mind
no
degree
of
criminality
is
attachable
to
disbelief
and
that
they
only
are
reprehensible
who
neglect
to
remove
the
false
medium
through
which
their
mind
views
any
subject
of
discussion
every
reflecting
mind
must
acknowledge
that
there
is
no
proof
of
the
existence
of
a
deity
god
is
an
hypothesis
and
as
such
stands
in
need
of
proof
the
onus
probandi
rests
on
the
theist
sir
isaac
newton
says
hypotheses
non
fingo
quicquid

ex
phaenomenis
non

vocanda
est
et

vel

in

non
habent
to
all
proofs
of
the
existence
of
a
creative
god
apply
this
valuable
rule
we
see
a
variety
of
bodies
possessing
a
variety
of
powers
we
merely
know
their
effects
we
are
in
a
state
of
ignorance
with
respect
to
their
essences
and
causes
these
newton
calls
the
phenomena
of
things
but
the
pride
of
philosophy
is
unwilling
to
admit
its
ignorance
of
their
causes
from
the
phenomena
which
are
the
objects
of
our
senses
we
attempt
to
infer
a
cause
which
we
call
god
and
gratuitously
endow
it
with
all
negative
and
contradictory
qualities
from
this
hypothesis
we
invent
this
general
name
to
conceal
our
ignorance
of
causes
and
essences
the
being
called
god
by
no
means
answers
with
the
conditions
prescribed
by
newton
it
bears
every
mark
of
a
veil
woven
by
philosophical
conceit
to
hide
the
ignorance
of
philosophers
even
from
themselves
they
borrow
the
threads
of
its
texture
from
the
anthropomorphism
of
the
vulgar
words
have
been
used
by
sophists
for
the
same
purposes
from
the
occult
qualities
of
the
peripatetics
to
the
effluvium
of

the

or

of

god

represented
as

eternal
incomprehensible
he
is
contained
under
every
predicate
in
non
that
the
logic
of
ignorance
could
fabricate
even
his
worshippers
allow
that
it
is
impossible
to
form
any
idea
of
him
they
exclaim

the

that
atheism
leaves
to
man

natural

reputation

everything

but
superstition
destroys
all
these
and
erects
itself
into
a
tyranny
over

hence
atheism

the

whose

is
briefly
this
that
god
made
the
earth
in
six
days
and
there
planted
a
delightful
garden
in
which
he
placed
the
first
pair
of
human
beings
in
the
midst
of
the
garden
he
planted
a
tree
whose
fruit
although
within
their
reach
they
were
forbidden
to
touch
that
the
devil
in
the
shape
of
a
snake
persuaded
them
to
eat
of
this
fruit
in
consequence
of
which
god
condemned
both
them
and
their
posterity
yet
unborn
to
satisfy
his
justice
by
their
eternal
misery
that
four
thousand
years
after
these
events
the
human
race
in
the
meanwhile
having
gone
unredeemed
to
perdition
god
engendered
with
the
betrothed
wife
of
a
carpenter
in
judea
whose
virginity
was
nevertheless
uninjured
and
begat
a
son
whose
name
was
jesus
christ
and
who
was
crucified
and
died
in
order
that
no
more
men
might
be
devoted
to
he
bearing
the
burthen
of
his
father
displeasure
by
proxy
the
book
states
in
addition
that
the
soul
of
whoever
disbelieves
this
sacrifice
will
be
burned
with
everlasting
fire
during
many
ages
of
misery
and
darkness
this
story
gained
implicit
belief
but
at
length
men
arose
who
suspected
that
it
was
a
fable
and
imposture
and
that
jesus
christ
so
far
from
being
a
god
was
only
a
man
like
themselves
but
a
numerous
set
of
men
who
derived
and
still
derive
immense
emoluments
from
this
opinion
in
the
shape
of
a
popular
belief
told
the
vulgar
that
if
they
did
not
believe
in
the
bible
they
would
be
damned
to
all
eternity
and
burned
imprisoned
and
poisoned
all
the
unbiassed
and
unconnected
inquirers
who
occasionally
arose
they
still
oppress
them
so
far
as
the
people
now
become
more
enlightened
will
allow
the
belief
in
all
that
the
bible
contains
is
called
christianity
a
roman
governor
of
judea
at
the
instance
of
a
mob
crucified
a
man
called
jesus
eighteen
centuries
ago
he
was
a
man
of
pure
life
who
desired
to
rescue
his
countrymen
from
the
tyranny
of
their
barbarous
and
degrading
superstitions
the
common
fate
of
all
who
desire
to
benefit
mankind
awaited
him
the
rabble
at
the
instigation
of
the
priests
demanded
his
death
although
his
very
judge
made
public
acknowledgement
of
his
innocence
jesus
was
sacrificed
to
the
honour
of
that
god
with
whom
he
was
afterwards
confounded
it
is
of
importance
therefore
to
distinguish
between
the
pretended
character
of
this
being
as
the
son
of
god
and
the
saviour
of
the
world
and
his
real
character
as
a
man
who
for
a
vain
attempt
to
reform
the
world
paid
the
forfeit
of
his
life
to
that
overbearing
tyranny
which
has
since
so
long
desolated
the
universe
in
his
name
whilst
the
one
is
a
hypocritical
daemon
who
announces
himself
as
the
god
of
compassion
and
peace
even
whilst
he
stretches
forth
his
hand
with
the
sword
of
discord
to
waste
the
earth
having
confessedly
devised
this
scheme
of
desolation
from
eternity
the
other
stands
in
the
foremost
list
of
those
true
heroes
who
have
died
in
the
glorious
martyrdom
of
liberty
and
have
braved
torture
contempt
and
poverty
in
the
cause
of
suffering
humanity
since
writing
this
note
i
have
some
reason
to
suspect
that
jesus
was
an
ambitious
man
who
aspired
to
the
throne
of
judea
the
vulgar
ever
in
extremes
became
persuaded
that
the
crucifixion
of
jesus
was
a
supernatural
event
testimonies
of
miracles
so
frequent
in
unenlightened
ages
were
not
wanting
to
prove
that
he
was
something
divine
this
belief
rolling
through
the
lapse
of
ages
met
with
the
reveries
of
plato
and
the
reasonings
of
aristotle
and
acquired
force
and
extent
until
the
divinity
of
jesus
became
a
dogma
which
to
dispute
was
death
which
to
doubt
was
infamy
christianity
is
now
the
established
religion
he
who
attempts
to
impugn
it
must
be
contented
to
behold
murderers
and
traitors
take
precedence
of
him
in
public
opinion
though
if
his
genius
be
equal
to
his
courage
and
assisted
by
a
peculiar
coalition
of
circumstances
future
ages
may
exalt
him
to
a
divinity
and
persecute
others
in
his
name
as
he
was
persecuted
in
the
name
of
his
predecessor
in
the
homage
of
the
world
the
same
means
that
have
supported
every
other
popular
belief
have
supported
christianity
war
imprisonment
assassination
and
falsehood
deeds
of
unexampled
and
incomparable
atrocity
have
made
it
what
it
is
the
blood
shed
by
the
votaries
of
the
god
of
mercy
and
peace
since
the
establishment
of
his
religion
would
probably
suffice
to
drown
all
other
sectaries
now
on
the
habitable
globe
we
derive
from
our
ancestors
a
faith
thus
fostered
and
supported
we
quarrel
persecute
and
hate
for
its
maintenance
even
under
a
government
which
whilst
it
infringes
the
very
right
of
thought
and
speech
boasts
of
permitting
the
liberty
of
the
press
a
man
is
pilloried
and
imprisoned
because
he
is
a
deist
and
no
one
raises
his
voice
in
the
indignation
of
outraged
humanity
but
it
is
ever
a
proof
that
the
falsehood
of
a
proposition
is
felt
by
those
who
use
coercion
not
reasoning
to
procure
its
admission
and
a
dispassionate
observer
would
feel
himself
more
powerfully
interested
in
favour
of
a
man
who
depending
on
the
truth
of
his
opinions
simply
stated
his
reasons
for
entertaining
them
than
in
that
of
his
aggressor
who
daringly
avowing
his
unwillingness
or
incapacity
to
answer
them
by
argument
proceeded
to
repress
the
energies
and
break
the
spirit
of
their
promulgator
by
that
torture
and
imprisonment
whose
infliction
he
could
command
analogy
seems
to
favour
the
opinion
that
as
like
other
systems
christianity
has
arisen
and
augmented
so
like
them
it
will
decay
and
perish
that
as
violence
darkness
and
deceit
not
reasoning
and
persuasion
have
procured
its
admission
among
mankind
so
when
enthusiasm
has
subsided
and
time
that
infallible
controverter
of
false
opinions
has
involved
its
pretended
evidences
in
the
darkness
of
antiquity
it
will
become
obsolete
that
milton
poem
alone
will
give
permanency
to
the
remembrance
of
its
absurdities
and
that
men
will
laugh
as
heartily
at
grace
faith
redemption
and
original
sin
as
they
now
do
at
the
metamorphoses
of
jupiter
the
miracles
of
romish
saints
the
efficacy
of
witchcraft
and
the
appearance
of
departed
spirits
had
the
christian
religion
commenced
and
continued
by
the
mere
force
of
reasoning
and
persuasion
the
preceding
analogy
would
be
inadmissible
we
should
never
speculate
on
the
future
obsoleteness
of
a
system
perfectly
conformable
to
nature
and
reason
it
would
endure
so
long
as
they
endured
it
would
be
a
truth
as
indisputable
as
the
light
of
the
sun
the
criminality
of
murder
and
other
facts
whose
evidence
depending
on
our
organization
and
relative
situations
must
remain
acknowledged
as
satisfactory
so
long
as
man
is
man
it
is
an
incontrovertible
fact
the
consideration
of
which
ought
to
repress
the
hasty
conclusions
of
credulity
or
moderate
its
obstinacy
in
maintaining
them
that
had
the
jews
not
been
a
fanatical
race
of
men
had
even
the
resolution
of
pontius
pilate
been
equal
to
his
candour
the
christian
religion
never
could
have
prevailed
it
could
not
even
have
existed
on
so
feeble
a
thread
hangs
the
most
cherished
opinion
of
a
sixth
of
the
human
race
when
will
the
vulgar
learn
humility
when
will
the
pride
of
ignorance
blush
at
having
believed
before
it
could
comprehend
either
the
christian
religion
is
true
or
it
is
false
if
true
it
comes
from
god
and
its
authenticity
can
admit
of
doubt
and
dispute
no
further
than
its
omnipotent
author
is
willing
to
allow
either
the
power
or
the
goodness
of
god
is
called
in
question
if
he
leaves
those
doctrines
most
essential
to
the
of
man
in
doubt
and
dispute
the
only
ones
which
since
their
promulgation
have
been
the
subject
of
unceasing
cavil
the
cause
of
irreconcilable
hatred
if
god
has
spoken
why
is
the
universe
not
convinced
there
is
this
passage
in
the
christian
scriptures
who
obey
not
god
and
believe
not
the
gospel
of
his
son
shall
be
punished
with
everlasting
destruction
this
is
the
pivot
upon
which
all
religions
turn
they
all
assume
that
it
is
in
our
power
to
believe
or
not
to
believe
whereas
the
mind
can
only
believe
that
which
it
thinks
true
a
human
being
can
only
be
supposed
accountable
for
those
actions
which
are
influenced
by
his
will
but
belief
is
utterly
distinct
from
and
unconnected
with
volition
it
is
the
apprehension
of
the
agreement
or
disagreement
of
the
ideas
that
compose
any
preposition
belief
is
a
passion
or
involuntary
operation
of
the
mind
and
like
other
passions
its
intensity
is
precisely
proportionate
to
the
degrees
of
excitement
volition
is
essential
to
merit
or
demerit
but
the
christian
religion
attaches
the
highest
possible
degrees
of
merit
and
demerit
to
that
which
is
worthy
of
neither
and
which
is
totally
unconnected
with
the
peculiar
faculty
of
the
mind
whose
presence
is
essential
to
their
being
christianity
was
intended
to
reform
the
world
had
an
being
planned
it
nothing
is
more
improbable
than
that
it
should
have
failed
omniscience
would
infallibly
have
foreseen
the
inutility
of
a
scheme
which
experience
demonstrates
to
this
age
to
have
been
utterly
unsuccessful
christianity
inculcates
the
necessity
of
supplicating
the
deity
prayer
may
be
considered
under
two
points
of
view
as
an
endeavour
to
change
the
intentions
of
god
or
as
a
formal
testimony
of
our
obedience
but
the
former
case
supposes
that
the
caprices
of
a
limited
intelligence
can
occasionally
instruct
the
creator
of
the
world
how
to
regulate
the
universe
and
the
latter
a
certain
degree
of
servility
analogous
to
the
loyalty
demanded
by
earthly
tyrants
obedience
indeed
is
only
the
pitiful
and
cowardly
egotism
of
him
who
thinks
that
he
can
do
something
better
than
reason
christianity
like
all
other
religions
rests
upon
miracles
prophecies
and
martyrdoms
no
religion
ever
existed
which
had
not
its
prophets
its
attested
miracles
and
above
all
crowds
of
devotees
who
would
bear
patiently
the
most
horrible
tortures
to
prove
its
authenticity
it
should
appear
that
in
no
case
can
a
discriminating
mind
subscribe
to
the
genuineness
of
a
miracle
a
miracle
is
an
infraction
of
nature
law
by
a
supernatural
cause
by
a
cause
acting
beyond
that
eternal
circle
within
which
all
things
are
included
god
breaks
through
the
law
of
nature
that
he
may
convince
mankind
of
the
truth
of
that
revelation
which
in
spite
of
his
precautions
has
been
since
its
introduction
the
subject
of
unceasing
schism
and
cavil
miracles
resolve
themselves
into
the
following
question
see
essay
volume
page
whether
it
is
more
probable
the
laws
of
nature
hitherto
so
immutably
harmonious
should
have
undergone
violation
or
that
a
man
should
have
told
a
lie
whether
it
is
more
probable
that
we
are
ignorant
of
the
natural
cause
of
an
event
or
that
we
know
the
supernatural
one
that
in
old
times
when
the
powers
of
nature
were
less
known
than
at
present
a
certain
set
of
men
were
themselves
deceived
or
had
some
hidden
motive
for
deceiving
others
or
that
god
begat
a
son
who
in
his
legislation
measuring
merit
by
belief
evidenced
himself
to
be
totally
ignorant
of
the
powers
of
the
human
mind
of
what
is
voluntary
and
what
is
the
contrary
we
have
many
instances
of
men
telling
lies
none
of
an
infraction
of
nature
laws
those
laws
of
whose
government
alone
we
have
any
knowledge
or
experience
the
records
of
all
nations
afford
innumerable
instances
of
men
deceiving
others
either
from
vanity
or
interest
or
themselves
being
deceived
by
the
limitedness
of
their
views
and
their
ignorance
of
natural
causes
but
where
is
the
accredited
case
of
god
having
come
upon
earth
to
give
the
lie
to
his
own
creations
there
would
be
something
truly
wonderful
in
the
appearance
of
a
ghost
but
the
assertion
of
a
child
that
he
saw
one
as
he
passed
through
the
churchyard
is
universally
admitted
to
be
less
miraculous
but
even
supposing
that
a
man
should
raise
a
dead
body
to
life
before
our
eyes
and
on
this
fact
rest
his
claim
to
being
considered
the
son
of
god
the
humane
society
restores
drowned
persons
and
because
it
makes
no
mystery
of
the
method
it
employs
its
members
are
not
mistaken
for
the
sons
of
god
all
that
we
have
a
right
to
infer
from
our
ignorance
of
the
cause
of
any
event
is
that
we
do
not
know
it
had
the
mexicans
attended
to
this
simple
rule
when
they
heard
the
cannon
of
the
spaniards
they
would
not
have
considered
them
as
gods
the
experiments
of
modern
chemistry
would
have
defied
the
wisest
philosophers
of
ancient
greece
and
rome
to
have
accounted
for
them
on
natural
principles
an
author
of
strong
common
sense
has
observed
that
miracle
is
no
miracle
at
he
might
have
added
that
a
miracle
is
no
miracle
in
any
case
for
until
we
are
acquainted
with
all
natural
causes
we
have
no
reason
to
imagine
others
there
remains
to
be
considered
another
proof
of
christianity
prophecy
a
book
is
written
before
a
certain
event
in
which
this
event
is
foretold
how
could
the
prophet
have
foreknown
it
without
inspiration
how
could
he
have
been
inspired
without
god
the
greatest
stress
is
laid
on
the
prophecies
of
moses
and
hosea
on
the
dispersion
of
the
jews
and
that
of
isaiah
concerning
the
coming
of
the
messiah
the
prophecy
of
moses
is
a
collection
of
every
possible
cursing
and
blessing
and
it
is
so
far
from
being
marvellous
that
the
one
of
dispersion
should
have
been
fulfilled
that
it
would
have
been
more
surprising
if
out
of
all
these
none
should
have
taken
effect
in
deuteronomy
chapter
verse
where
moses
explicitly
foretells
the
dispersion
he
states
that
they
shall
there
serve
gods
of
wood
and
stone
the
lord
shall
scatter
thee
among
all
people
from
the
one
end
of
the
earth
even
to
the
other
and
there
thou
shalt
serve
other
gods
which
neither
thou
nor
thy
fathers
have
known
even
gods
of
wood
and
stone
the
jews
are
at
this
day
remarkably
tenacious
of
their
religion
moses
also
declares
that
they
shall
be
subjected
to
these
curses
for
disobedience
to
his
ritual
it
shall
come
to
pass
if
thou
wilt
not
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
lord
thy
god
to
observe
to
do
all
the
commandments
and
statutes
which
i
command
thee
this
day
that
all
these
curses
shall
come
upon
thee
and
overtake
thee
is
this
the
real
reason
the
third
fourth
and
fifth
chapters
of
hosea
are
a
piece
of
immodest
confession
the
indelicate
type
might
apply
in
a
hundred
senses
to
a
hundred
things
the
chapter
of
isaiah
is
more
explicit
yet
it
does
not
exceed
in
clearness
the
oracles
of
delphos
the
historical
proof
that
moses
isaiah
and
hosea
did
write
when
they
are
said
to
have
written
is
far
from
being
clear
and
circumstantial
but
prophecy
requires
proof
in
its
character
as
a
miracle
we
have
no
right
to
suppose
that
a
man
foreknew
future
events
from
god
until
it
is
demonstrated
that
he
neither
could
know
them
by
his
own
exertions
nor
that
the
writings
which
contain
the
prediction
could
possibly
have
been
fabricated
after
the
event
pretended
to
be
foretold
it
is
more
probable
that
writings
pretending
to
divine
inspiration
should
have
been
fabricated
after
the
fulfilment
of
their
pretended
prediction
than
that
they
should
have
really
been
divinely
inspired
when
we
consider
that
the
latter
supposition
makes
god
at
once
the
creator
of
the
human
mind
and
ignorant
of
its
primary
powers
particularly
as
we
have
numberless
instances
of
false
religions
and
forged
prophecies
of
things
long
past
and
no
accredited
case
of
god
having
conversed
with
men
directly
or
indirectly
it
is
also
possible
that
the
description
of
an
event
might
have
foregone
its
occurrence
but
this
is
far
from
being
a
legitimate
proof
of
a
divine
revelation
as
many
men
not
pretending
to
the
character
of
a
prophet
have
nevertheless
in
this
sense
prophesied
lord
chesterfield
was
never
yet
taken
for
a
prophet
even
by
a
bishop
yet
he
uttered
this
remarkable
prediction
despotic
government
of
france
is
screwed
up
to
the
highest
pitch
a
revolution
is
fast
approaching
that
revolution
i
am
convinced
will
be
radical
and
sanguinary
this
appeared
in
the
letters
of
the
prophet
long
before
the
accomplishment
of
this
wonderful
prediction
now
have
these
particulars
come
to
pass
or
have
they
not
if
they
have
how
could
the
earl
have
foreknown
them
without
inspiration
if
we
admit
the
truth
of
the
christian
religion
on
testimony
such
as
this
we
must
admit
on
the
same
strength
of
evidence
that
god
has
affixed
the
highest
rewards
to
belief
and
the
eternal
tortures
of
the
worm
to
disbelief
both
of
which
have
been
demonstrated
to
be
involuntary
the
last
proof
of
the
christian
religion
depends
on
the
influence
of
the
holy
ghost
theologians
divide
the
influence
of
the
holy
ghost
into
its
ordinary
and
extraordinary
modes
of
operation
the
latter
is
supposed
to
be
that
which
inspired
the
prophets
and
apostles
and
the
former
to
be

to
the

the

by
the

to
prove
that

man
forsook
the

sacrificed
the
purity

happiness
of
his

to
unnatural

the
date
of

have
also
been
that
of

in

the

is
one
likewise
which

admitted
to
be

has

explained
prometheus
stole
fire
from

and
was
chained
for
this
crime
to
mount
caucasus
where
a
vulture
continually
devoured
his
liver
that
grew
to
meet
its
hunger
hesiod
says
that
before
the
time
of
prometheus
mankind
were
exempt
from
suffering
that
they
enjoyed
a
vigorous
youth
and
that
death
when
at
length
it
came

the
whole

question
how
can
the

be
reconciled
with
the
liberty

pleasures
of

how
can

reject
the
evils
of
the
system
which
is
now
interwoven
with
all
the
fibres
of
our
being

believe
that
abstinence
from
animal
food
and
spirituous
liquors
would
in
a
great
measure
capacitate
us
for
the
solution
of
this
important
question
it
is
true
that
mental
and
bodily
derangement
is
attributable
in
part
to
other
deviations
from
rectitude
and
nature
than
those
which
concern
diet
the
mistakes
cherished
by
society
respecting
the
connection
of
the

whence
the
misery
and
diseases
of
unsatisfied
celibacy
unenjoying
prostitution
and
the
premature
arrival
of

necessarily
spring
the
putrid
atmosphere
of

the
exhalations
of

processes
the
muffling
of
our
bodies
in
superfluous

the
absurd
treatment
of
infants
all
these
and
innumerable
other
causes
contribute
their
mite
to
the
mass
of
human
evil
comparative
anatomy
teaches
us
that
man
resembles
frugivorous
animals
in
everything
and
carnivorous
in
nothing
he
has
neither
claws
wherewith
to
seize
his
prey
nor
distinct

tear

a

be
degraded

an
unnatural
and
inhuman
operation
that
the
flaccid
fibre
may
offer
a
fainter
resistance
to

it
is
only
by
softening
and
disguising
dead
flesh
by
culinary
preparation
that
it
is
rendered
susceptible
of
mastication

and
that
the
sight
of
its
bloody

horror
does
not
excite
intolerable
loathing

the

which
arises
from

is
sufficiently
apparent
see
lambe
reports
on

i
do
not
assert
that
the
use
of

is
in
itself
unnatural
but
that
the
unperverted
palate
would
swallow
no
liquid
capable
of
occasioning

the

drink
it

not
the

not
the

nothing
that
we
are

in

something
then
wherein
we
differ
from
them
our

of
altering
our

by
fire
so
that
our
appetite
is
no
longer
a
just
criterion
for
the
fitness
of
its

in
children
there
remain
no
traces
of
that
instinct
which
determines
in

other
animals
what
aliment
is
natural
or
otherwise
and
so
perfectly
obliterated
are
they
in
the
reasoning
adults
of
our
species
that
it
has
become
necessary
to
urge
considerations
drawn
from
comparative
anatomy
to
prove
that
we
are
naturally
frugivorous
crime
is
madness
madness
is
disease
whenever
the
cause
of

shall
be
discovered
the
root
from
which
all
vice
and
misery
have
so
long
overshadowed
the

lie
bare
to
the
axe
all
the
exertions
of
man
from
that

may
be
considered
as
tending
to
the
clear
profit
of
his
species
no
sane
mind
in
a
sane
body
resolves
upon
a
real
crime
it
is
a
man
of
violent
passions
bloodshot
eyes
and
swollen
veins
that
alone
can
grasp
the
knife
of
murder
the
system
of
a
simple
diet
promises
no
utopian
advantages
it
is
no
mere
reform
of
legislation
whilst
the
furious
passions
and
evil
propensities
of
the
human
heart
in
which
it
had
its
origin
are
still
unassuaged
it
strikes
at
the
root
of
all
evil
and
is
an
experiment
which
may
be
tried
with
success
not
alone
by
nations
but
by
small
societies
families
and
even
individuals
in
no
cases
has
a
return
to
vegetable
diet
produced
the
slightest
injury
in
most
it
has
been
attended
with
changes
undeniably
beneficial
should
ever
a
physician
be
born
with
the
genius
of
locke
i
am
persuaded
that
he
might
trace
all
bodily
and
mental
derangements
to
our
unnatural
habits
as
clearly
as
that
philosopher
has
traced
all
knowledge
to
sensation
what
prolific
sources
of
disease
are
not
those
mineral
and
vegetable
poisons
that
have
been
introduced
for
its
extirpation
how
many
thousands
have
become
murderers
and
robbers
bigots
and
domestic
tyrants
dissolute
and
abandoned
adventurers
from
the
use
of
fermented
liquors
who
had
they
slaked
their
thirst
only
with
pure
water
would
have
lived
but
to
diffuse
the
happiness
of
their
own
unperverted
feelings
how
many
groundless
opinions
and
absurd
institutions
have
not
received
a
general
sanction
from
the
sottishness
and
intemperance
of
individuals
who
will
assert
that
had
the
populace
of
paris
satisfied
their
hunger
at
the
table
of
vegetable
nature
they
would
have
lent
their
brutal
suffrage
to
the
of
robespierre
could
a
set
of
men
whose
passions
were
not
perverted
by
unnatural
stimuli
look
with
coolness
on
an
auto

is
it
to
be
believed
that
a
being
of
gentle
feelings
rising
from
his
meal
of
roots
would
take
delight
in
sports
of

you
read

his

his
eyes
beam
with
healthfulness

its
invariable
concomitants
cheerfulness

benignity
though
history
has
decided
none
of
these
questions
a
child
could
not
hesitate
to
answer
in
the
negative
surely
the
cheek
of
buonaparte
his
wrinkled
brow
and
yellow
eye
the
ceaseless
inquietude
of
his
nervous
system
speak
no
less
plainly
the
character
of
his
unresting
ambition
than
his
murders
and
his
victories
it
is
impossible
had
buonaparte
descended
from
a
race
of
vegetable
feeders
that
he
could
have
had
either
the
inclination
or
the
power
to
ascend
the
throne
of
the
bourbons
the
desire
of
tyranny
could
scarcely
be
excited
in
the
individual
the
power
to
tyrannize
would
certainly
not
be
delegated
by
a
society
neither
frenzied
by
inebriation
nor
rendered
impotent
and
irrational
by
disease
pregnant
indeed
with
inexhaustible
calamity
is
the
renunciation
of

it
concerns
our
physical

not
enumerate
nor

perhaps
suspect
the

innoxious

corrupted
by

can
wonder
that
all
the

that
those

have

alone
might
offer
a
certain
pledge
of
the
future
moral
reformation
of

on
a
natural
system
of

old
age
would
be
our
last
and
our
only
malady
the
term
of
our
existence
would
be
protracted
we
should
enjoy

and
no
longer
preclude
others
from
the
enjoyment
of
it
all
sensational
delights
would
be
infinitely
more
exquisite
and
perfect
the
very
sense
of
being
would
then
be
a
continued
pleasure
such
as
we
now
feel
it
in
some
few
and
favoured
moments
of
our
youth
by
all
that
is
sacred
in
our
hopes
for
the
human
race
i
conjure
those
who
love
happiness
and
truth
to
give
a
fair
trial
to
the
vegetable
system
reasoning
is
surely
superfluous
on
a
subject
whose
merits
an
experience
of
six
months
would
set
for
ever
at
rest
but
it
is
only
among
the
enlightened
and
benevolent
that
so
great
a
sacrifice
of
appetite
and
prejudice
can
be
expected
even
though
its
ultimate
excellence
should
not
admit
of
dispute
it
is
found
easier
by
the
victims
of
disease
to
palliate
their
torments
by
medicine
than
to
prevent
them
by
regimen
the
vulgar
of
all
ranks
are
invariably
sensual
and
indocile
yet
i
can
not
but
feel
myself
persuaded
that
when
the
benefits
of
vegetable
diet
are
mathematically
proved
when
it
is
as
clear
that
those
who
live
naturally
are
exempt
from
premature
death
as
that
nine
is
not
one
the
most
sottish
of
mankind
will
feel
a
preference
towards
a
long
and
tranquil
contrasted
with
a
short
and
painful
life
on
the
average
out
of
sixty
persons
four
die
in
three
years
hopes
are
entertained
that
in
april
a
statement
will
be
given
that
sixty
persons
all
having
lived
more
than
three
years
on
vegetables
and
pure
water
are
then
in
perfect
health
more
than
two
years
have
now
elapsed
not
one
of
them
has
died
no
such
example
will
be
found
in
any
sixty
persons
taken
at
random
seventeen
persons
of
all
ages
the
families
of
lambe
and
newton
have
lived
for
seven
years
on
this
diet
without
a
death
and
almost
without
the
slightest
illness
surely
when
we
consider
that
some
of
those
were
infants
and
one
a
martyr
to
asthma
now
nearly
subdued
we
may
challenge
any
seventeen
persons
taken
at
random
in
this
city
to
exhibit
a
parallel
case
those
who
may
have
been
excited
to
question
the
rectitude
of
established
habits
of
diet
by
these
loose
remarks
should
consult
newton
luminous
and
eloquent
essay
return
to
nature
or
defence
of
vegetable
regimen
cadell
when
these
proofs
come
fairly
before
the
world
and
are
clearly
seen
by
all
who
understand
arithmetic
it
is
scarcely
possible
that
abstinence
from
aliments
demonstrably
pernicious
should
not
become
universal
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
proselytes
so
will
be
the
weight
of
evidence
and
when
a
thousand
persons
can
be
produced
living
on
vegetables
and
distilled
water
who
have
to
dread
no
disease
but
old
age
the
world
will
be
compelled
to
regard
animal
flesh
and
fermented
liquors
as
slow
but
certain
poisons
the
change
which
would
be
produced
by
simpler
habits
on
political
economy
is
sufficiently
remarkable
the
monopolizing
eater
of
animal
flesh
would
no
longer
destroy
his
constitution
by
devouring
an
acre
at
a
meal
and
many
loaves
of
bread
would
cease
to
contribute
to
gout
madness
and
apoplexy
in
the
shape
of
a
pint
of
porter
or
a
dram
of
gin
when
appeasing
the
famine
of
the
hardworking
peasant
hungry
babes
the
quantity
of
nutritious
vegetable
matter
consumed
in
fattening
the
carcase
of
an
ox
would
afford
ten
times
the
sustenance
undepraving
indeed
and
incapable
of
generating
disease
if
gathered
immediately
from
the
bosom
of
the
earth
the
most
fertile
districts
of
the
habitable
globe
are
now
actually
cultivated
by
men
for
animals
at
a
delay
and
waste
of
aliment
absolutely
incapable
of
calculation
it
is
only
the
wealthy
that
can
to
any
great
degree
even
now
indulge
the
unnatural
craving
for
dead
flesh
and
they
pay
for
the
greater
licence
of
the
privilege
by
subjection
to
supernumerary
diseases
again
the
spirit
of
the
nation
that
should
take
the
lead
in
this
great
reform
would
insensibly
become
agricultural
commerce
with
all
its
vice
selfishness
and
corruption
would
gradually
decline
more
natural
habits
would
produce
gentler
manners
and
the
excessive
complication
of
political
relations
would
be
so
far
simplified
that
every
individual
might
feel
and
understand
why
he
loved
his
country
and
took
a
personal
interest
in
its
welfare
how
would
england
for
example
depend
on
the
caprices
of
foreign
rulers
if
she
contained
within
herself
all
the
necessaries
and
despised
whatever
they
possessed
of
the
luxuries
of
life
how
could
they
starve
her
into
compliance
with
their
views
of
what
consequence
would
it
be
that
they
refused
to
take
her
woollen
manufactures
when
large
and
fertile
tracts
of
the
island
ceased
to
be
allotted
to
the
waste
of
pasturage
on
a
natural
system
of
diet
we
should
require
no
spices
from
india
no
wines
from
portugal
spain
france
or
madeira
none
of
those
multitudinous
articles
of
luxury
for
which
every
corner
of
the
globe
is
rifled
and
which
are
the
causes
of
so
much
individual
rivalship
such
calamitous
and
sanguinary
national
disputes
in
the
history
of
modern
times
the
avarice
of
commercial
monopoly
no
less
than
the
ambition
of
weak
and
wicked
chiefs
seems
to
have
fomented
the
universal
discord
to
have
added
stubbornness
to
the
mistakes
of
cabinets
and
indocility
to
the
infatuation
of
the
people
let
it
ever
be
remembered
that
it
is
the
direct
influence
of
commerce
to
make
the
interval
between
the
richest
and
the
poorest
man
wider
and
more
unconquerable
let
it
be
remembered
that
it
is
a
foe
to
everything
of
real
worth
and
excellence
in
the
human
character
the
odious
and
disgusting
aristocracy
of
wealth
is
built
upon
the
ruins
of
all
that
is
good
in
chivalry
or
republicanism
and
luxury
is
the
forerunner
of
a
barbarism
scarce
capable
of
cure
is
it
impossible
to
realize
a
state
of
society
where
all
the
energies
of
man
shall
be
directed
to
the
production
of
his
solid
happiness
certainly
if
this
advantage
the
object
of
all
political
speculation
be
in
any
degree
attainable
it
is
attainable
only
by
a
community
which
holds
out
no
factitious
incentives
to
the
avarice
and
ambition
of
the
few
and
which
is
internally
organized
for
the
liberty
security
and
comfort
of
the
many
none
must
be
entrusted
with
power
and
money
is
the
completest
species
of
power
who
do
not
stand
pledged
to
use
it
exclusively
for
the
general
benefit
but
the
use
of
animal
flesh
and
fermented
liquors
directly
militates
with
this
equality
of
the
rights
of
man
the
peasant
can
not
gratify
these
fashionable
cravings
without
leaving
his
family
to
starve
without
disease
and
war
those
sweeping
curtailers
of
population
pasturage
would
include
a
waste
too
great
to
be
afforded
the
labour
requisite
to
support
a
family
is
far
lighter
than
is
usually
supposed
it
has
come
under
the
author
experience
that
some
of
the
workmen
on
an
embankment
in
north
wales
who
in
consequence
of
the
inability
of
the
proprietor
to
pay
them
seldom
received
their
wages
have
supported
large
families
by
cultivating
small
spots
of
sterile
ground
by
moonlight
in
the
notes
to
pratt
poem
bread
or
the
poor
is
an
account
of
an
industrious
labourer
who
by
working
in
a
small
garden
before
and
after
his
day
task
attained
to
an
enviable
state
of
independence
the
peasantry
work
not
only
for
themselves
but
for
the
aristocracy
the
army
and
the
manufacturers
the
advantage
of
a
reform
in
diet
is
obviously
greater
than
that
of
any
other
it
strikes
at
the
root
of
the
evil
to
remedy
the
abuses
of
legislation
before
we
annihilate
the
propensities
by
which
they
are
produced
is
to
suppose
that
by
taking
away
the
effect
the
cause
will
cease
to
operate
but
the
efficacy
of
this
system
depends
entirely
on
the
proselytism
of
individuals
and
grounds
its
merits
as
a
benefit
to
the
community
upon
the
total
change
of
the
dietetic
habits
in
its
members
it
proceeds
securely
from
a
number
of
particular
cases
to
one
that
is
universal
and
has
this
advantage
over
the
contrary
mode
that
one
error
does
not
invalidate
all
that
has
gone
before
let
not
too
much
however
be
expected
from
this
system
the
healthiest
among
us
is
not
exempt
from
hereditary
disease
the
most
symmetrical
athletic
and
longlived
is
a
being
inexpressibly
inferior
to
what
he
would
have
been
had
not
the
unnatural
habits
of
his
ancestors
accumulated
for
him
a
certain
portion
of
malady
and
deformity
in
the
most
perfect
specimen
of
civilized
man
something
is
still
found
wanting
by
the
physiological
critic
can
a
return
to
nature
then
instantaneously
eradicate
predispositions
that
have
been
slowly
taking
root
in
the
silence
of
innumerable
ages
indubitably
not
all
that
i
contend
for
is
that
from
the
moment
of
the
relinquishing
all
unnatural
habits
no
new
disease
is
generated
and
that
the
predisposition
to
hereditary
maladies
gradually
perishes
for
want
of
its
accustomed
supply
in
cases
of
consumption
cancer
gout
asthma
and
scrofula
such
is
the
invariable
tendency
of
a
diet
of
vegetables
and
pure
water
those
who
may
be
induced
by
these
remarks
to
give
the
vegetable
system
a
fair
trial
should
in
the
first
place
date
the
commencement
of
their
practice
from
the
moment
of
their
conviction
all
depends
upon
breaking
through
a
pernicious
habit
resolutely
and
at
once
trotter
asserts
that
no
drunkard
was
ever
reformed
by
gradually
relinquishing
his

trotter
on
the
nervous
temperament
animal
flesh
in
its
effects
on
the
human
stomach
is
analogous
to
a
dram
it
is
similar
in
the
kind
though
differing
in
the
degree
of
its
operation
the
proselyte
to
a
pure
diet
must
be
warned
to
expect
a
temporary
diminution
of
muscular
strength
the
subtraction
of
a
powerful
stimulus
will
suffice
to
account
for
this
event
but
it
is
only
temporary
and
is
succeeded
by
an
equable
capability
for
exertion
far
surpassing
his
former
various
and
fluctuating
strength
above
all
he
will
acquire
an
easiness
of
breathing
by
which
such
exertion
is
performed
with
a
remarkable
exemption
from
that
painful
and
difficult
panting
now
felt
by
almost
every
one
after
hastily
climbing
an
ordinary
mountain
he
will
be
equally
capable
of
bodily
exertion
or
mental
application
after
as
before
his
simple
meal
he

no
longer
pine
under
the
lethargy
of
ennui
that
unconquerable
weariness
of
life
more
to
be
dreaded
than

itself

will
escape
the

madness
which
broods
over
its
own
injurious
notions
of
the

the
hell

feign
every
man
forms
as
it
were

god

to
the

acceptable
than

would
be

or
persecuting

for
the
love
of

he
will
find
moreover
a
system
of
simple
diet
to
be
a
system
of
perfect
epicurism
he
will
no
longer
be
incessantly
occupied
in
blunting
and
destroying
those
organs
from
which
he
expects
his
gratification
the
pleasures
of

to
be
derived
from

potatoes

with
a

greater
than
is
supposed
these
who
wait
until
they
can
eat
this
plain
fare
with
the
sauce
of

scarcely

the

find
some

in

of

brutal
pleasures

a

full
of
horror

note
on
queen
mab
by
shelley
shelley
was
eighteen
when
he
wrote
queen
mab
he
never
published
it
when
it
was
written
he
had
come
to
the
decision
that
he
was
too
young
to
be
a
of
controversies
and
he
was
desirous
of
acquiring
sobriety
of
spirit
which
is
the
characteristic
of
true
heroism
but
he
never
doubted
the
truth
or
utility
of
his
opinions
and
in
printing
and
privately
distributing
queen
mab
he
believed
that
he
should
further
their
dissemination
without
occasioning
the
mischief
either
to
others
or
himself
that
might
arise
from
publication
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
would
himself
have
admitted
it
into
a
collection
of
his
works
his
severe
classical
taste
refined
by
the
constant
study
of
the
greek
poets
might
have
discovered
defects
that
escape
the
ordinary
reader
and
the
change
his
opinions
underwent
in
many
points
would
have
prevented
him
from
putting
forth
the
speculations
of
his
boyish
days
but
the
poem
is
too
beautiful
in
itself
and
far
too
remarkable
as
the
production
of
a
boy
of
eighteen
to
allow
of
its
being
passed
over
besides
that
having
been
frequently
reprinted
the
omission
would
be
vain
in
the
former
edition
certain
portions
were
left
out
as
shocking
the
general
reader
from
the
violence
of
their
attack
on
religion
i
myself
had
a
painful
feeling
that
such
erasures
might
be
looked
upon
as
a
mark
of
disrespect
towards
the
author
and
am
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
of
restoring
them
the
notes
also
are
reprinted
entire
not
because
they
are
models
of
reasoning
or
lessons
of
truth
but
because
shelley
wrote
them
and
that
all
that
a
man
at
once
so
distinguished
and
so
excellent
ever
did
deserves
to
be
preserved
the
alterations
his
opinions
underwent
ought
to
be
recorded
for
they
form
his
history
a
series
of
articles
was
published
in
the
new
monthly
magazine
during
the
autumn
of
the
year
written
by
a
man
of
great
talent
a
and
warm
friend
of
shelley
they
describe
admirably
the
state
of
his
mind
during
his
collegiate
life
inspired
with
ardour
for
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
endowed
with
the
keenest
sensibility
and
with
the
fortitude
of
a
martyr
shelley
came
among
his
congregated
for
the
purposes
of
education
like
a
spirit
from
another
sphere
too
delicately
organized
for
the
rough
treatment
man
uses
towards
man
especially
in
the
season
of
youth
and
too
resolute
in
carrying
out
his
own
sense
of
good
and
justice
not
to
become
a
victim
to
a
devoted
attachment
to
those
he
loved
he
added
a
determined
resistance
to
oppression
refusing
to
fag
at
eton
he
was
treated
with
revolting
cruelty
by
masters
and
boys
this
roused
instead
of
taming
his
spirit
and
he
rejected
the
duty
of
obedience
when
it
was
enforced
by
menaces
and
punishment
to
aversion
to
the
society
of
his
such
as
he
found
them
when
collected
together
in
societies
where
one
egged
on
the
other
to
acts
of
tyranny
was
joined
the
deepest
sympathy
and
compassion
while
the
attachment
he
felt
for
individuals
and
the
admiration
with
which
he
regarded
their
powers
and
their
virtues
led
him
to
entertain
a
high
opinion
of
the
perfectibility
of
human
nature
and
he
believed
that
all
could
reach
the
highest
grade
of
moral
improvement
did
not
the
customs
and
prejudices
of
society
foster
evil
passions
and
excuse
evil
actions
the
oppression
which
trembling
at
every
nerve
yet
resolute
to
heroism
it
was
his
to
encounter
at
school
and
at
college
led
him
to
dissent
in
all
things
from
those
whose
arguments
were
blows
whose
faith
appeared
to
engender
blame
and
hatred
my
existence
he
wrote
to
a
friend
in
have
incessantly
speculated
thought
and
read
his
readings
were
not
always
well
chosen
among
them
were
the
works
of
the
french
philosophers
as
far
as
metaphysical
argument
went
he
temporarily
became
a
convert
at
the
same
time
it
was
the
cardinal
article
of
his
faith
that
if
men
were
but
taught
and
induced
to
treat
their
fellows
with
love
charity
and
equal
rights
this
earth
would
realize
paradise
he
looked
upon
religion
as
it
is
professed
and
above
all
practised
as
hostile
instead
of
friendly
to
the
cultivation
of
those
virtues
which
would
make
men
brothers
can
this
be
wondered
at
at
the
age
of
seventeen
fragile
in
health
and
frame
of
the
purest
habits
in
morals
full
of
devoted
generosity
and
universal
kindness
glowing
with
ardour
to
attain
wisdom
resolved
at
every
personal
sacrifice
to
do
right
burning
with
a
desire
for
affection
and
sympathy
he
was
treated
as
a
reprobate
cast
forth
as
a
criminal
the
cause
was
that
he
was
sincere
that
he
believed
the
opinions
which
he
entertained
to
be
true
and
he
loved
truth
with
a
martyr
love
he
was
ready
to
sacrifice
station
and
fortune
and
his
dearest
affections
at
its
shrine
the
sacrifice
was
demanded
from
and
made
by
a
youth
of
seventeen
it
is
a
singular
fact
in
the
history
of
society
in
the
civilized
nations
of
modern
times
that
no
false
step
is
so
irretrievable
as
one
made
in
early
youth
older
men
it
is
true
when
they
oppose
their
fellows
and
transgress
ordinary
rules
carry
a
certain
prudence
or
hypocrisy
as
a
shield
along
with
them
but
youth
is
rash
nor
can
it
imagine
while
asserting
what
it
believes
to
be
true
and
doing
what
it
believes
to
be
right
that
it
should
be
denounced
as
vicious
and
pursued
as
a
criminal
shelley
possessed
a
quality
of
mind
which
experience
has
shown
me
to
be
of
the
rarest
occurrence
among
human
beings
this
was
his
unworldliness
the
usual
motives
that
rule
men
prospects
of
present
or
future
advantage
the
rank
and
fortune
of
those
around
the
taunts
and
censures
or
the
praise
of
those
who
were
hostile
to
him
had
no
influence
whatever
over
his
actions
and
apparently
none
over
his
thoughts
it
is
difficult
even
to
express
the
simplicity
and
directness
of
purpose
that
adorned
him
some
few
might
be
found
in
the
history
of
mankind
and
some
one
at
least
among
his
own
friends
equally
disinterested
and
scornful
even
to
severe
personal
sacrifices
of
every
baser
motive
but
no
one
i
believe
ever
joined
this
noble
but
passive
virtue
to
equal
active
endeavours
for
the
benefit
of
his
friends
and
mankind
in
general
and
to
equal
power
to
produce
the
advantages
he
desired
the
world
brightest
gauds
and
its
most
solid
advantages
were
of
no
worth
in
his
eyes
when
compared
to
the
cause
of
what
he
considered
truth
and
the
good
of
his
born
in
a
position
which
to
his
inexperienced
mind
afforded
the
greatest
facilities
to
practise
the
tenets
he
espoused
he
boldly
declared
the
use
he
would
make
of
fortune
and
station
and
enjoyed
the
belief
that
he
should
materially
benefit
his
by
his
actions
while
conscious
of
surpassing
powers
of
reason
and
imagination
it
is
not
strange
that
he
should
even
while
so
young
have
believed
that
his
written
thoughts
would
tend
to
disseminate
opinions
which
he
believed
conducive
to
the
happiness
of
the
human
race
if
man
were
a
creature
devoid
of
passion
he
might
have
said
and
done
all
this
with
quietness
but
he
was
too
enthusiastic
and
too
full
of
hatred
of
all
the
ills
he
witnessed
not
to
scorn
danger
various
disappointments
tortured
but
could
not
tame
his
soul
the
more
enmity
he
met
the
more
earnestly
he
became
attached
to
his
peculiar
views
and
hostile
to
those
of
the
men
who
persecuted
him
he
was
animated
to
greater
zeal
by
compassion
for
his
his
sympathy
was
excited
by
the
misery
with
which
the
world
is
burning
he
witnessed
the
sufferings
of
the
poor
and
was
aware
of
the
evils
of
ignorance
he
desired
to
induce
every
rich
man
to
despoil
himself
of
superfluity
and
to
create
a
brotherhood
of
property
and
service
and
was
ready
to
be
the
first
to
lay
down
the
advantages
of
his
birth
he
was
of
too
uncompromising
a
disposition
to
join
any
party
he
did
not
in
his
youth
look
forward
to
gradual
improvement
nay
in
those
days
of
intolerance
now
almost
forgotten
it
seemed
as
easy
to
look
forward
to
the
sort
of
millennium
of
freedom
and
brotherhood
which
he
thought
the
proper
state
of
mankind
as
to
the
present
reign
of
moderation
and
improvement
made
him
believe
that
his
race
would
soon
be
run
that
a
year
or
two
was
all
he
had
of
life
he
desired
that
these
years
should
be
useful
and
illustrious
he
saw
in
a
fervent
call
on
his
to
share
alike
the
blessings
of
the
creation
to
love
and
serve
each
other
the
noblest
work
that
life
and
time
permitted
him
in
this
spirit
he
composed
queen
mab
he
was
a
lover
of
the
wonderful
and
wild
in
literature
but
had
not
fostered
these
tastes
at
their
genuine
sources
the
romances
and
chivalry
of
the
middle
ages
but
in
the
perusal
of
such
german
works
as
were
current
in
those
days
under
the
influence
of
these
he
at
the
age
of
fifteen
wrote
two
short
prose
romances
of
slender
merit
the
sentiments
and
language
were
exaggerated
the
composition
imitative
and
poor
he
wrote
also
a
poem
on
the
subject
of
ahasuerus
being
led
to
it
by
a
german
fragment
he
picked
up
dirty
and
torn
in
lincoln
inn
fields
this
fell
afterwards
into
other
hands
and
was
considerably
altered
before
it
was
printed
our
earlier
english
poetry
was
almost
unknown
to
him
the
love
and
knowledge
of
nature
developed
by
wordsworth
the
lofty
melody
and
mysterious
beauty
of
poetry
and
the
wild
fantastic
machinery
and
gorgeous
scenery
adopted
by
southey
composed
his
favourite
reading
the
rhythm
of
queen
mab
was
founded
on
that
of
thalaba
and
the
first
few
lines
bear
a
striking
resemblance
in
spirit
though
not
in
idea
to
the
opening
of
that
poem
his
fertile
imagination
and
ear
tuned
to
the
finest
sense
of
harmony
preserved
him
from
imitation
another
of
his
favourite
books
was
the
poem
of
gebir
by
walter
savage
landor
from
his
boyhood
he
had
a
wonderful
facility
of
versification
which
he
carried
into
another
language
and
his
latin
were
composed
with
an
ease
and
correctness
that
procured
for
him
prizes
and
caused
him
to
be
resorted
to
by
all
his
friends
for
help
he
was
at
the
period
of
writing
queen
mab
a
great
traveller
within
the
limits
of
england
scotland
and
ireland
his
time
was
spent
among
the
loveliest
scenes
of
these
countries
mountain
and
lake
and
forest
were
his
home
the
phenomena
of
nature
were
his
favourite
study
he
loved
to
inquire
into
their
causes
and
was
addicted
to
pursuits
of
natural
philosophy
and
chemistry
as
far
as
they
could
be
carried
on
as
an
amusement
these
tastes
gave
truth
and
vivacity
to
his
descriptions
and
warmed
his
soul
with
that
deep
admiration
for
the
wonders
of
nature
which
constant
association
with
her
inspired
he
never
intended
to
publish
queen
mab
as
it
stands
but
a
few
years
after
when
printing
alastor
he
extracted
a
small
portion
which
he
entitled
the
daemon
of
the
world
in
this
he
changed
somewhat
the
versification
and
made
other
alterations
scarcely
to
be
called
improvements
some
years
after
when
in
italy
a
bookseller
published
an
edition
of
queen
mab
as
it
originally
stood
shelley
was
hastily
written
to
by
his
friends
under
the
idea
that
deeply
injurious
as
the
mere
distribution
of
the
poem
had
proved
the
publication
might
awaken
fresh
persecutions
at
the
suggestion
of
these
friends
he
wrote
a
letter
on
the
subject
printed
in
the
examiner
newspaper
with
which
i
close
this
history
of
his
earliest
work
to
the
editor
of
the
heard
that
a
poem
entitled
queen
mab
has
been
surreptitiously
published
in
london
and
that
legal
proceedings
have
been
instituted
against
the
publisher
i
request
the
favour
of
your
insertion
of
the
following
explanation
of
the
affair
as
it
relates
to
me
poem
entitled
queen
mab
was
written
by
me
at
the
age
of
eighteen
i
daresay
in
a
sufficiently
intemperate
spirit
but
even
then
was
not
intended
for
publication
and
a
few
copies
only
were
struck
off
to
be
distributed
among
my
personal
friends
i
have
not
seen
this
production
for
several
years
i
doubt
not
but
that
it
is
perfectly
worthless
in
point
of
literary
composition
and
that
in
all
that
concerns
moral
and
political
speculation
as
well
as
in
the
subtler
discriminations
of
metaphysical
and
religious
doctrine
it
is
still
more
crude
and
immature
i
am
a
devoted
enemy
to
religious
political
and
domestic
oppression
and
i
regret
this
publication
not
so
much
from
literary
vanity
as
because
i
fear
it
is
better
fitted
to
injure
than
to
serve
the
sacred
cause
of
freedom
i
have
directed
my
solicitor
to
apply
to
chancery
for
an
injunction
to
restrain
the
sale
but
after
the
precedent
of
southey
wat
tyler
a
poem
written
i
believe
at
the
same
age
and
with
the
same
unreflecting
enthusiasm
with
little
hope
of
success
i
exonerate
myself
from
all
share
in
having
divulged
opinions
hostile
to
existing
sanctions
under
the
form
whatever
it
may
be
which
they
assume
in
this
poem
it
is
scarcely
necessary
for
me
to
protest
against
the
system
of
inculcating
the
truth
of
christianity
or
the
excellence
of
monarchy
however
true
or
however
excellent
they
may
be
by
such
equivocal
arguments
as
confiscation
and
imprisonment
and
invective
and
slander
and
the
insolent
violation
of
the
most
sacred
ties
of
nature

society

it
appears
independent

ah

smoke
it
all
passes
like
thee
then
at

all
my

entirely
lost
my

you

you
the

which

will
do

this

few
of
writers
this
age
has
abundance
and
plenty
three
score
and
a
thousand
two
millions
and
twenty
three
score
of
them
wits
who
all
sharply
vie
to
try
what
odd
creature
they
best
can
belie
a
thousand
are
prudes
who
for
charity
write
and
fill
up
their
sheets
with
spleen
envy
and
spite
one
million
are
bards
who
to
heaven
aspire
and
stuff
their
works
full
of
bombast
rant
and
fire
million
are
wags
who
in
grubstreet
attend
and
just
like
a
cobbler
the
old
writings
mend
the
twenty
are
those
who
for
pulpits
indite
and
pore
over
sermons
all
saturday
night
and
now
my
good
friends
who
come
after
i
mean
as
i
wore
a
cassock
or
dined
with
a
dean
or
like
cobblers
at
mending
i
never
did
try
nor
with
poets
in
lyrics
attempted
to
vie
as
for
prudes
these
good
souls
i
both
hate
and
detest
so
here
i
believe
the
matter
must
i
heard
your
complaint
my
answer
i
made
and
since
to
your
calls
all
the
tribute
i
paid
adieu
my
good
friend
pray
never
despair
but
grammar
and
sense
and
everything
dare
attempt
but
to
write
dashing
easy
and
free
then
take
out
your
grammar
and
pay
him
his
fee
be
not
a
coward
shrink
not
to
a
tense
but
read
it
all
over
and
make
it
out
sense
what
a
tiresome
girl
pray
soon
make
an
end
else
my
limited
patience
you
quickly
expend
well
adieu
i
no
longer
your
patience
will
try
so
swift
to
the
post
now
the
letter
shall
fly
january
to
miss
harriet
grove
from
miss
elizabeth
shelley
for
your
letter
dear
hattie
accept
my
best
thanks
rendered
long
and
amusing
by
virtue
of
franks
though
concise
they
would
please
yet
the
longer
the
better
the
more
news
that
crammed
in
more
amusing
the
letter
all
excuses
of
etiquette
nonsense
i
hate
which
only
are
fit
for
the
tardy
and
late
as
when
converse
grows
flat
of
the
weather
they
talk
how
fair
the
sun
shines
a
fine
day
for
a
walk
then
to
politics
turn
of
burdett
reformation
one
declares
it
would
hurt
better
the
nation
will
ministers
keep
sure
they
acted
quite
wrong
the
burden
this
is
of
each
song
so
is
going
to
you
say
i
hope
that
success
her
great
efforts
will
pay
that
the
colonel
will
see
her
be
dazzled
outright
and
declare
he
ca
bear
to
be
out
of
her
sight
write
flaming
epistles
with
love
pointed
dart
whose
sharp
little
arrow
struck
right
on
his
heart
scold
poor
innocent
cupid
for
mischievous
ways
he
knows
not
how
much
to
laud
forth
her
praise
that
he
neither
eats
drinks
or
sleeps
for
her
sake
and
hopes
her
hard
heart
some
compassion
will
take
a
refusal
would
kill
him
so
desperate
his
flame
but
he
fears
for
he
knows
she
is
not
common
game
then
praises
her
sense
wit
discernment
and
grace
he
not
one
that
caught
by
a
sly
looking
face
yet
that
too
divine
such
a
black
sparkling
eye
at
the
bare
glance
of
which
near
a
thousand
will
die
thus
runs
he
on
meaning
but
one
word
in
ten
more
than
is
meant
by
most
such
kind
of
men
for
they
all
alike
take
them
one
with
another
begging
pardon
with
the
exception
of
my
brother
of
the
drawings
you
mention
much
praise
i
have
heard
most
opinion
the
same
with
the
difference
of
word
some
get
a
good
name
by
the
voice
of
the
crowd
whilst
to
poor
humble
merit
small
praise
is
allowed
as
in
parliament
votes
so
in
pictures
a
name
oft
determines
a
fate
at
the
altar
of
so
on
friday
this
city
gay
vortex
you
quit
and
no
longer
with
doctors
and
johnny
cats
sit
now
your
parcel
arrived
bysshe
letter
shall
go
i
hope
all
your
joy
may
be
turned
into
woe
experience
will
tell
you
that
pleasure
is
vain
when
it
promises
sunshine
how
often
comes
rain
so
when
to
fond
hope
every
blessing
is
nigh
how
oft
when
we
smile
it
is
checked
with
a
sigh
when
hope
gay
deceiver
in
pleasure
is
dressed
how
oft
comes
a
stroke
that
may
rob
us
of
rest
when
we
think
ourselves
safe
and
the
goal
near
at
hand
like
a
vessel
just
landing
we
wrecked
near
the
strand
and
though
memory
forever
the
sharp
pang
must
feel
our
duty
to
bear
and
our
hardship
to
steel
may
misfortunes
dear
girl
thy
happiness
cloy
may
thy
days
glide
in
peace
love
comfort
and
joy
may
thy
tears
with
soft
pity
for
other
woes
flow
woes
which
thy
tender
heart
never
may
know
for
hardships
our
own
god
has
taught
us
to
bear
though
sympathy
soul
to
a
friend
drops
a
tear
oh
dear
what
sentimental
stuff
have
i
written
only
fit
to
tear
up
and
play
with
a
kitten
what
sober
reflections
in
the
midst
of
this
letter
jocularity
sure
would
have
suited
much
better
but
there
are
exceptions
to
all
common
rules
for
this
is
a
truth
by
all
boys
learned
at
schools
now
adieu
my
dear
hattie
i
sure
i
must
tire
for
if
i
do
you
may
throw
it
into
the
fire
so
accept
the
best
love
of
your
cousin
and
friend
which
brings
this
nonsensical
rhyme
to
an
end
april
note
mischievous
mischevious
song
cold
cold
is
the
blast
when
december
is
howling
cold
are
the
damps
on
a
dying
man
brow
stern
are
the
seas
when
the
wild
waves
are
rolling
and
sad
is
the
grave
where
a
loved
one
lies
low
but
colder
is
scorn
from
the
being
who
loved
thee
more
stern
is
the
sneer
from
the
friend
who
has
proved
thee
more
sad
are
the
tears
when
their
sorrows
have
moved
thee
which
mixed
with
groans
anguish
and
wild
madness
flow
and
ah
poor
has
felt
all
this
horror
full
long
the
fallen
victim
contended
with
fate
a
destitute
outcast
abandoned
to
sorrow
she
sought
her
babe
food
at
her
ruiner
gate
another
had
charmed
the
remorseless
betrayer
he
turned
laughing
aside
from
her
moans
and
her
prayer
she
said
nothing
but
wringing
the
wet
from
her
hair
crossed
the
dark
mountain
side
though
the
hour
it
was
late
was
on
the
wild
height
of
the
dark
penmanmawr
that
the
form
of
the
wasted
reclined
she
shrieked
to
the
ravens
that
croaked
from
afar
and
she
sighed
to
the
gusts
of
the
wild
sweeping
i
call
not
yon
rocks
where
the
thunder
peals
rattle
i
call
not
yon
clouds
where
the
elements
battle
but
thee
cruel
i
call
thee
unkind
then
she
wreathed
in
her
hair
the
wild
flowers
of
the
mountain
and
deliriously
laughing
a
garland
entwined
she
bedewed
it
with
tears
then
she
hung
the
fountain
and
leaving
it
cast
it
a
prey
to
the
wind
go
she
exclaimed
the
tempest
is
yelling
unkind
to
be
cast
on
the
sea
that
is
swelling
but
i
left
a
pitiless
outcast
my
dwelling
my
garments
are
torn
so
they
say
is
my
mind
not
long
lived
but
over
her
grave
waved
the
desolate
form
of
a
yew
around
it
no
demons
or
ghosts
dare
to
rave
but
spirits
of
peace
steep
her
slumbers
in
dew
then
stay
thy
swift
steps
mid
the
dark
mountain
heather
though
chill
blow
the
wind
and
severe
is
the
weather
for
perfidy
traveller
can
not
bereave
her
of
the
tears
to
the
tombs
of
the
innocent
july
song
come
harriet
sweet
is
the
hour
soft
zephyrs
breathe
gently
around
the
anemone
flower
has
sunk
its
pale
head
on
the
ground
is
thus
the
world
keenness
hath
torn
some
mild
heart
that
expands
to
its
blast
thus
that
the
wretched
forlorn
sinks
poor
and
neglected
at
the
world
with
its
keenness
and
woe
has
no
charms
or
attraction
for
me
its
unkindness
with
grief
has
laid
low
the
heart
which
is
faithful
to
thee
the
high
trees
that
wave
past
the
moon
as
i
walk
in
their
umbrage
with
you
all
declare
i
must
part
with
you
soon
all
bid
you
a
tender
adieu
then
harriet
dearest
farewell
you
and
i
love
may
meet
again
these
woods
and
these
meadows
can
tell
how
soft
and
how
sweet
was
the
april
song
despair
ask
not
the
pallid
stranger
woe
with
beating
heart
and
throbbing
breast
whose
step
is
faltering
weak
and
slow
as
though
the
body
needed
whose
eye
no
object
meets
nor
cares
to
ken
a
friendly
glance
with
silent
grief
his
bosom
beats
now
fixed
as
in
a
deathlike
trance
who
looks
around
with
fearful
eye
and
shuns
all
converse
with
man
kind
as
though
some
one
his
griefs
might
spy
and
soothe
them
with
a
kindred
mind
a
friend
or
foe
to
him
the
same
he
looks
on
each
with
equal
eye
the
difference
lies
but
in
the
name
to
none
for
comfort
can
he
deep
despair
and
sorrow
trace
to
him
too
keenly
given
whose
memory
time
could
not
efface
his
peace
was
lodged
in
he
looks
on
all
this
world
bestows
the
pride
and
pomp
of
power
as
trifles
best
for
pageant
shows
which
vanish
in
an
hour
when
torn
is
dear
affection
tie
sinks
the
soft
heart
full
low
it
leaves
without
a
parting
sigh
all
that
these
realms
bestow
june
song
sorrow
to
me
this
world
a
dreary
blank
all
hopes
in
life
are
gone
and
fled
my
high
strung
energies
are
sank
and
all
my
blissful
hopes
lie
the
world
once
smiling
to
my
view
showed
scenes
of
endless
bliss
and
joy
the
world
i
then
but
little
knew
ah
little
knew
how
pleasures
cloy
all
then
was
jocund
all
was
gay
no
thought
beyond
the

i
danced
in

fading

its

deep
sorrow

where

rankling
traces
the
rising
tear
the
stifled
sigh

but
ill
at
ease

like
blackening
clouds
in
stormy
sky
where
fiercely
vivid
lightnings
play
thus
when
souls

is
dead
when
sorrow
dims
each
earthly
view
when
every
fairy
hope
is
fled
we
bid
ungrateful

adieu

calm
my

be
not
true

true
they
are

i

thy
whisperings
soft
of

be
there

may

dry
my
fast
falling

ah
sweet
is
the
moonbeam
that
sleeps
on
yon
fountain
and
sweet
the
mild
rush
of
the
breeze
and
sweet
is
the
glimpse
of
yon
mountain
the
verdant
arcades
of
yon
shadowy
trees
but
sweeter
than
all
was
thy
tone
of
affection
which
scarce
seemed
to
break
on
the
stillness
of
eve
though
the
time
it
is
past
yet
the
dear
recollection
for
aye
in
the
heart
of
thy
percy
must
live
yet
he
hears
thy
dear
voice
in
the
summer
winds
sighing
mild
accents
of
happiness
lisp
in
his
ear
when
the
moments
athwart
him
are
flying
and
he
thinks
of
the
friend
to
his
bosom
so
and
thou
dearest
friend
in
his
bosom
for
ever
must
reign
unalloyed
by
the
fast
rolling
year
he
loves
thee
and
dearest
one
never
oh
never
canst
thou
cease
to
be
loved
by
a
heart
so
sincere

stern

ear
or
compels
us
for
aye
bid
adieu
to
the
land
where
exists
that
loved
friend
to
our
bosom
so
dear
sterner
than
death
the
shuddering
wretch
bending
and
in
skeleton
grasp
his
fell
sceptre
extending
like
the
deer
to
that
loved
covert
wending
which
never
again
to
his
eyes
may
appear
and
ah
he
may
envy
the
quarry
who
bids
to
the
friend
of
affection
farewell
he
may
envy
the
bosom
so
bleeding
and
gory
he
may
envy
the
sound
of
the
drear
passing
knell
not
so
deep
is
his
grief
on
his
death
couch
reposing
when
on
the
last
vision
his
dim
eyes
are
closing
as
the
outcast
whose
senses
are
losing
the
last
tones
of
thy
voice
on
the
wild
breeze
that
swell
those
tones
were
so
soft
and
so
sad
that
ah
never
can
the
sound
cease
to
vibrate
on
memory
ear
in
the
stern
wreck
of
nature
for
ever
and
ever
the
remembrance
must
live
of
a
friend
so
sincere
august
saint
edmond
eve
oh
did
you
observe
the
black
canon
pass
and
did
you
observe
his
frown
he
goeth
to
say
the
midnight
mass
in
holy
edmond
town
he
goeth
to
sing
the
burial
chaunt
and
to
lay
the
wandering
sprite
whose
shadowy
restless
form
doth
haunt
the
abbey
drear
aisle
this
night
it
saith
it
will
not
its
wailing
cease
that
holy
man
come
near
he
pour
its
grave
the
prayer
of
peace
and
sprinkle
the
hallowed
tear
the
canon
horse
is
stout
and
strong
the
road
is
plain
and
fair
but
the
canon
slowly
wends
along
and
his
brow
is
gloomed
with
care
who
is
it
thus
late
at
the
sullen
echoes
the
portal
bell
it
sounds
like
the
whispering
voice
of
fate
it
sounds
like
a
funeral
knell
the
canon
his
faltering
knee
thrice
bowed
and
his
frame
was
convulsed
with
fear
when
a
voice
was
heard
distinct
and
loud
for
thy
hour
is
near
he
crosses
his
breast
he
mutters
a
prayer
to
heaven
he
lifts
his
eye
he
heeds
not
the
abbot
gazing
stare
nor
the
dark
monks
who
murmured
by
he
worships
the
sculptured
saints
that
frown
on
the
sacred
walls
his
face
it
grows
pale
he
trembles
he
faints
at
the
abbot
feet
he
falls
and
straight
the
father
robe
he
kissed
who
cried
dwells
with
thee
the
spirit
will
fade
like
the
morning
mist
at
your
benedicite
haste
within
the
board
is
spread
keen
blows
the
air
and
cold
the
spectre
sleeps
in
its
earthy
bed
edmond
bell
hath
tolled
rest
your
wearied
limbs
you
journeyed
many
a
mile
lay
the
wailing
sprite
that
shrieks
in
the
moonlight
aisle
faint
are
my
limbs
and
my
bosom
is
cold
yet
must
the
sprite
be
laid
yet
when
the
hour
of
horror
told
must
i
meet
the
wandering
shade
food
nor
rest
may
now
delay
for
hark
the
echoing
pile
a
bell
loud
shakes
oh
haste
away
o
lead
to
the
haunted
aisle
the
torches
slowly
move
before
the
cross
is
raised
on
high
a
smile
of
peace
the
canon
wore
but
horror
dimmed
his
eye
and
now
they
climb
the
footworn
stair
the
chapel
gates
unclose
now
each
breathed
low
a
fervent
prayer
and
fear
each
bosom
froze
now
paused
awhile
the
doubtful
band
and
viewed
the
solemn
scene
full
dark
the
clustered
columns
stand
the
moon
gleams
pale
between
father
say
what
cloisters
gloom
conceals
the
unquiet
shade
within
what
dark
unhallowed
tomb
the
corse
unblessed
was
laid
yonder
drear
aisle
alone
it
walks
and
murmurs
a
mournful
plaint
of
thee
black
canon
it
wildly
talks
and
call
on
thy
patron
saint
the
pilgrim
this
night
with
wondering
eyes
as
he
prayed
at
edmond
shrine
from
a
black
marble
tomb
hath
seen
it
rise
and
under
yon
arch
recline
say
upon
that
black
marble
tomb
what
memorial
sad
appears
it
lies
in
the
chancel
gloom
no
memorial
sad
it
bears
the
canon
his
paternoster
reads
his
rosary
hung
by
his
side
now
swift
to
the
chancel
doors
he
leads
and
untouched
they
open
wide
resistless
strange
sounds
his
steps
impel
to
approach
to
the
black
marble
tomb
enter
black
canon
a
whisper
fell
enter
thy
hour
is
come
he
paused
told
his
beads
and
the
threshold
passed
oh
horror
the
chancel
doors
close
a
loud
yell
was
borne
on
the
rising
blast
and
a
deep
dying
groan
arose
the
monks
in
amazement
shuddering
stand
they
burst
through
the
chancel
gloom
from
edmond
shrine
lo
a
skeleton
hand
points
to
the
black
marble
tomb
lo
deeply
engraved
an
inscription
blood
red
in
characters
fresh
and
clear
guilty
black
canon
of
elmham
dead
and
his
wife
lies
buried
here
in
elmham
tower
he
wedded
a
nun
to
edmond
his
bride
he
bore
on
this
eve
her
noviciate
here
was
begun
and
a
monk
gray
weeds
she
wore
o
deep
was
her
conscience
dyed
with
guilt
remorse
she
full
oft
revealed
her
blood
by
the
ruthless
black
canon
was
spilt
and
in
death
her
lips
he
sealed
her
spirit
to
penance
this
night
was
doomed
the
canon
atoned
the
deed
here
together
they
now
shall
rest
entombed
their
bodies
from
dust
are
freed
hark
a
loud
peal
of
thunder
shakes
the
roof
round
the
altar
bright
lightnings
play
speechless
with
horror
the
monks
stand
aloof
and
the
storm
dies
sudden
away
the
inscription
was
gone
a
cross
on
the
ground
and
a
rosary
shone
through
the
gloom
but
never
again
was
the
canon
there
found
or
the
ghost
on
the
black
marble
tomb
revenge
quit
me
not
yet
for
the
wind
whistles
shrill
its
blast
wanders
mournfully
over
the
hill
the
thunder
wild
voice
rattles
madly
above
you
will
not
then
can
not
then
leave
me
my
i

dearest
agnes
the
night

this
evening
to
strasburg

must
seek
the
drear
tomb
of
my
ancestors
bones
and
must
dig
their
remains
from
beneath
the
cold
stones
the
spirit
of
conrad
there
meets
me
this
night
and
we
quit
not

tomb

of
the
light
and

a
month
and
a
day
so
farewell
dearest
agnes
for

must
away
bid
me
bring
with
me
what
most
i
held
dear
or
a
month
from
that
time
should
i
lie
on
my
bier
and
i
sooner
resign
this
false
fluttering
breath
than
my
agnes
should
dread
either
danger
or
death
i
love
you
to
madness
my
agnes
i
love
my
constant
affection
this
night

night

sepulchre
jaw

i
glut
its
all
conquering
maw
no
loved
adolphus
thy
agnes
will
share
in
the
tomb
all
the
dangers
that
wait
for
you
there
i
fear
not
the
spirit
i
fear
not
the
grave
my
dearest
adolphus
i
perish
to

that
thy
love

not
go
but

those
ages
of
horror
and
woe
for
i
swear
to
thee
here
that
i
perish
ere
day
if
you
go
unattended
by
agnes
away
the
night
it
was
bleak
the
fierce
storm
raged
around
the
lightning
blue
flashed
on
the
ground
strange
forms
seemed
to
flit
and
howl
tidings
of
fate
as
agnes
advanced
to
the
sepulchre
the
youth
struck
the
portal
the
echoing
sound
was
fearfully
rolled
midst
the
tombstones
around
the
blue
lightning
gleamed
the
dark
chapel
spire
and
tinged
were
the
storm
clouds
with
sulphurous
fire
still
they
gazed
on
the
tombstone
where
conrad
reclined
yet
they
shrank
at
the
cold
chilling
blast
of
the
wind
when
a
strange
silver
brilliance
pervaded
the
scene
and
a
figure
advanced
tall
in
form
fierce
in
mien
a
mantle
encircled
his
shadowy
form
as
light
as
a
gossamer
borne
on
the
storm
celestial
terror
sat
throned
in
his
gaze
like
the
midnight
pestiferous
meteor
spirit
thy
father
adolphus
was
false
false
as
hell
and
conrad
has
cause
to
remember
it
well
he
ruined
my
mother
despised
me
his
son
i
quitted
the
world
ere
my
vengeance
was
done
i
was
nearly
expiring
was
close
of
the
day
a
demon
advanced
to
the
bed
where
i
lay
he
gave
me
the
power
from
whence
i
was
hurled
to
return
to
revenge
to
return
to
the
world
now
adolphus
i
seize
thy
best
loved
in
my
arms
i
drag
her
to
hades
all
blooming
in
charms
on
the
black
whirlwind
thundering
pinion
i
ride
and
fierce
yelling
fiends
shall
exult
thy
bride
he
spoke
and
extending
his
ghastly
arms
wide
majestic
advanced
with
a
swift
noiseless
stride
he
clasped
the
fair
agnes
he
raised
her
on
high
and
cleaving
the
roof
sped
his
way
to
the
sky
all
was
now
silent
and
over
the
tomb
thicker
deeper
was
swiftly
extended
a
gloom
adolphus
in
horror
sank
down
on
the
stone
and
his
fleeting
soul
fled
with
a
harrowing
groan
december
ghasta
or
the
avenging
demon
the
idea
of
the
following
tale
was
taken
from
a
few
unconnected
german
the
principal
character
is
evidently
the
wandering
jew
and
although
not
mentioned
by
name
the
burning
cross
on
his
forehead
undoubtedly
alludes
to
that
superstition
so
prevalent
in
the
part
of
germany
called
the
black
forest
where
this
scene
is
supposed
to
lie
hark
the
owlet
flaps
her
wing
in
the
pathless
dell
beneath

loudly
sing
tidings
of
despair
and
horror

for
the

awhile

with

a

blanched
the

cold

in

stranger

me
what

hour

stranger
you
are
i

to
tell
horrors
stranger
shalt
thou
hear
horrors
drear
as
those
of
hell
my
castle
silence
reigned
late
the
night
and
drear
the
hour
when
on
the
terrace
i
observed
a
fleeting
shadowy
mist
to
light
the
cloud
as
summer
fog
which
transient
shuns
the
morning
beam
fleeting
as
the
cloud
on

that
hangs

on

my
shuddering
brain
horror
dimmed

the
spot
to
fly
at

the
thin
and
shadowy
form
with
noiseless
trackless
footsteps

light
robe

on
the
storm
its
head
was
bound
with
lambent
flame
in
chilling
voice
drear
as
the

autumnal
ground

trees

for

chilling
time
that
wakes
the
dead
when
demons
ride
the

that
lower
the
phantom
sat
upon
my
bed
in
hollow
voice
low
as
the
sound
which
in
some
charnel
makes
its
moan
what
floats
along
the
burying
ground
the
phantom
claimed
me
as
her
own
her
chilling
finger
on
my

with
coldest
touch
congealed
my
soul
cold
as
the
finger
of
the

round
a

dead
of
the
night
when
i
sate
in
my
dwelling
one
glimmering
lamp
was
expiring
and
low
around
the
dark
tide
of
the
tempest
was
swelling
along
the
wild
mountains
were
yelling
they
bodingly
presaged
destruction
and
woe
then
that
i
started
the
wild
storm

howling
nought
was
seen
save
the
lightning
that
danced
on
the
sky
above
me
the
crash

when

the

tears
again
began
to

the

chilled

sate
in

to

he

he
rose
on

and
his

loud
did
beat
and
his

they
were
palsied
with

the

his

grew
and

shuddered
to

around

my

pain
pervaded
my

mine

again
methought

a
silvery
cloud

floated

strange
and
brilliant
light
my
form
upborne
by
viewless
aether
rode
and
spurned
the
lessening
realms
of
earthly
night
what
heavenly
notes
burst
on
my
ravished
ears
what
beauteous
spirits
met
my
dazzled
eye
hark
louder

the
music
of
the
spheres
more
clear
the
forms
of
speechless
bliss
float
by
and
heavenly
gestures
suit
aethereal

fairer
than

more
graceful
than
the

than

more
fair
were
the
bright
forms
that
swept
the
azure
sky
enthroned
in
roseate
light
a
heavenly
band
strewed
flowers
of
bliss
that
never
fade
away
they
welcome
virtue
to
its
native
land
and
songs
of
triumph
greet
the
joyous
day
when
endless
bliss
the
woes
of
fleeting
life
repay
congenial
minds
will
seek
their
kindred
soul
though
the
tide
of
time
has
rolled
between
they
mock
weak
matter
impotent
control
and
seek
of
endless
life
the
eternal
scene
at

vain
summons
this
will

him

be
till

fade
away
yes
francis
thine
was
the
dear
knife
that
tore
a
tyrant
from
his
guilty
breast
thine
was
the
daring
at
a
tyrant
gore
to
smile
in
triumph
to
contemn
the
rest
and
thine
loved
glory
of
thy
sex
to
tear
from
its
base
shrine
a
despot
haughty
soul
to
laugh
at
sorrow
in
secure
despair
to
mock
with
smiles
life
lingering
control
and
triumph
mid
the
griefs
that
round
thy
fate
did
roll
yes
the
fierce
spirits
of
the
avenging
deep
with
endless
tortures
goad
their
guilty
shades
i
see
the
lank
and
ghastly
spectres
sweep
along
the
burning
length
of
yon
arcades
and
i
see
satan
stalk
athwart
the
plain
he
hastes
along
the
burning
soil
of
hell
ye
despots
to
my
dark
domain
with
maddening
joy
mine

thy
nuptial

and
if

let

shed
on

can
you
ye
spread
your
perfumed
balm
mid
pearly
gems
of
dew
that
shine
so
bright
and
you
wild
winds
thus
can
you
sleep
so
still
whilst
throbs
the
tempest
of
my
breast
so
high
can
the
fierce
rest
on
yonder
hill
and
in
the
eternal
mansions
of
the
sky
can
the
directors
of
the
storm
in
powerless
silence
lie
hark
i
hear
music
on
the
zephyr
wing
louder
it
floats
along
the
unruffled
sky
some
fairy
sure
has
touched
the
viewless
string
now
faint
in
distant
air
the
murmurs
die
awhile
it
stills
the
tide
of
agony
now
now
it
loftier
swells
again
stern
woe
arises
with
the
awakening
melody
again
fierce
torments
such
as
demons
know
in
bitterer
feller
tide
on
this
torn
bosom
flow
arise
ye
sightless
spirits
of
the
storm
ye
unseen
minstrels
of
the
aereal
song
pour
the
fierce
tide
around
this
lonely
form
and
roll
the
tempest
wildest
swell
along
dart
the
red
lightning
wing
the
forked
flash
pour
from
thy
hills
the
thunder
roar
arouse
the
whirlwind
and
let
ocean
dash
in
fiercest
tumult
on
the
rocking
shore
destroy
this
life
or
let
earth
fabric
be
no
more
yes
every
tie
that
links
me
here
is
dead
mysterious
fate
thy
mandate
i
obey
since
hope
and
peace
and
joy
for
aye
are
fled
i
come
terrific
power
i
come
away
then
this
ruined
soul
let
spirits
of
hell
in
triumph
laughing
wildly
mock
its
pain
and
though
with
direst
pangs
mine
swell
i
echo
back
their
deadly
yells
again
cursing
the
power
that
made
aught
in
vain
fragment
yes
all
is
past
swift
time
has
fled
away
yet
its
swell
pauses
on
my
sickening
mind
how
long
will
horror
nerve
this
frame
of
clay
i
dead
and
lingers
yet
my
soul
behind
oh
powerful
fate
revoke
thy
deadly
spell
and
yet
that
may
not
ever
ever
be
heaven
will
not
smile
upon
the
work
of
hell
ah
no
for
heaven
can
not
smile
on
me
fate
envious
fate
has
sealed
my
wayward
destiny
i
sought
the
cold
brink
of
the
midnight
surge
i
sighed
beneath
its
wave
to
hide
my
woes
the
rising
tempest
sung
a
funeral
dirge
and
on
the
blast
a
frightful
yell
arose
wild
flew
the
meteors
the
maddened
main
wilder
did
grief
athwart
my
bosom
glare
stilled
was
the
unearthly
howling
and
a
strain
swelled
mid
the
tumult
of
the
battling
air
like
a
spirit
song
but
yet
more
soft
and
fair
i
met
a
maniac
like
he
was
to
me
i
said
victim
wherefore
dost
thou
roam
and
canst
thou
not
contend
with
agony
that
thus
at
midnight
thou
dost
quit
thine
home
there
she
sleeps
cold
is
her
bloodless
form
and
i
will
go
to
slumber
in
her
grave
and
then
our
ghosts
whilst
raves
the
maddened
storm
will
sweep
at
midnight
the
wildered
wave
wilt
thou
our
lowly
beds
with
tears
of
pity
lave
no
i
can
not
shed
the
pitying
tear
this
breast
is
cold
this
heart
can
feel
no
more
but
i
can
rest
me
on
thy
chilling
bier
can
shriek
in
horror
to
the
tempest
roar
the
spectral
horseman
what
was
the
shriek
that
struck
fancy
ear
as
it
sate
on
the
ruins
of
time
that
is
past
hark
it
floats
on
the
fitful
blast
of
the
wind
and
breathes
to
the
pale
moon
a
funeral
sigh
it
is
the
benshie
moan
on
the
storm
or
a
shivering
fiend
that
thirsting
for
sin
seeks
murder
and
guilt
when
virtue
sleeps
winged
with
the
power
of
some
ruthless
king
and
sweeps
the
breast
of
the
prostrate
plain
it
was
not
a
fiend
from
the
regions
of
hell
that
poured
its
low
moan
on
the
stillness
of
night
it
was
not
a
ghost
of
the
guilty
dead
nor
a
yelling
vampire
reeking
with
gore
but
aye
at
the
close
of
seven
years
end
that
voice
is
mixed
with
the
swell
of
the
storm
and
aye
at
the
close
of
seven
years
end
a
shapeless
shadow
that
sleeps
on
the
hill
awakens
and
floats
on
the
mist
of
the
heath
it
is
not
the
shade
of
a
murdered
man
who
has
rushed
uncalled
to
the
throne
of
his
god
and
howls
in
the
pause
of
the
eddying
storm
this
voice
is
low
cold
hollow
and
chill
not
heard
by
the
ear
but
is
felt
in
the
soul
is
more
frightful
far
than
the
scream
or
the
laughter
of
fiends
when
they
howl
the
corpse
of
a
man
who
has
sold
his
soul
to
hell
it
tells
the
approach
of
a
mystic
form
a
white
courser
bears
the
shadowy
sprite
more
thin
they
are
than
the
mists
of
the
mountain
when
the
clear
moonlight
sleeps
on
the
waveless
lake
more
pale
his
cheek
than
the
snows
of
nithona
when
winter
rides
on
the
northern
blast
and
howls
in
the
midst
of
the
leafless
wood
yet
when
the
fierce
swell
of
the
tempest
is
raving
and
the
whirlwinds
howl
in
the
caves
of
inisfallen
still
secure
mid
the
wildest
war
of
the
sky
the
phantom
courser
scours
the
waste
and
his
rider
howls
in
the
thunder
roar
him
the
fierce
bolts
of
avenging
heaven
pause
as
in
fear
to
strike
his
head
the
meteors
of
midnight
recoil
from
his
figure
yet
the
peasant
that
oft
passes
by
with
wonder
beholds
the
blue
flash
through
his
form
and
his
voice
though
faint
as
the
sighs
of
the
dead
the
startled
passenger
shudders
to
hear
more
distinct
than
the
thunder
wildest
roar
then
does
the
dragon
who
chained
in
the
caverns
to
eternity
curses
the
champion
of
erin
moan
and
yell
loud
at
the
lone
hour
of
midnight
and
twine
his
vast
wreaths
round
the
forms
of
the
daemons
then
in
agony
roll
his
eyeballs
though
by
death
yet
never
to
die
then
he
shakes
from
his
skeleton
folds
the
nightmares
who
shrieking
in
agony
seek
the
couch
of
some
fevered
wretch
who
courts
sleep
in
vain
then
the
tombless
ghosts
of
the
guilty
dead
in
horror
pause
on
the
fitful
gale
they
float
on
the
swell
of
the
eddying
tempest
and
scared
seek
the
caves
of
gigantic
where
their
thin
forms
pour
unearthly
sounds
on
the
blast
that
sweets
the
breast
of
the
lake
and
mingles
its
swell
with
the
moonlight
air
melody
to
a
scene
of
former
times
art
thou
indeed
forever
gone
forever
ever
lost
to
me
must
this
poor
bosom
beat
alone
or
beat
at
all
if
not
for
thee
ah
why
was
love
to
mortals
given
to
lift
them
to
the
height
of
heaven
or
dash
them
to
the
depths
of
hell
yet
i
do
not
reproach
thee
dear
ah
no
the
agonies
that
swell
this
panting
breast
this
frenzied
brain
might
wake
my
tear
oh
heaven
is
witness
i
did
love
and
heaven
does
know
i
love
thee
still
does
know
the
fruitless
thrill
when
reason
judgement
vainly
strove
to
blot
thee
from
my
memory
but
which
might
never
never
be
oh
i
appeal
to
that
blest
day
when
passion
wildest
ecstasy
was
coldness
to
the
joys
i
knew
when
every
sorrow
sunk
away
oh
i
had
never
lived
before
but
now
those
blisses
are
no
more
and
now
i
cease
to
live
again
i
do
not
blame
thee
love
ah
no
the
breast
that
feels
this
anguished
woe
throbs
for
thy
happiness
alone
two
years
of
speechless
bliss
are
gone
i
thank
thee
dearest
for
the
dream

faint

distant

the
wild
and
fitful
blast
it
moans
for
pleasures
that

moans
for

by

once
early
in
the
morning
beelzebub
arose
with
care
his
sweet
person
adorning
he
put
on
his
sunday
clothes
he
drew
on
a
boot
to
hide
his
hoof
he
drew
on
a
glove
to
hide
his
claw
his
horns
were
concealed
by
a
bras
chapeau
and
the
devil
went
forth
as
natty
a
beau
as
ever
saw
he
sate
him
down
in
london
town
before
earth
morning
ray
with
a
favourite
imp
he
began
to
chat
on
religion
and
scandal
this
and
that
until
the
dawn
of
day
and
then
to
james
court
he
went
and
paul
church
he
took
on
his
way
he
was
mighty
thick
with
every
saint
though
they
were
formal
and
he
was
gay
the
devil
was
an
agriculturist
and
as
bad
weeds
quickly
grow
in
looking
over
his
farm
i
wist
he
would
find
cause
for
woe
he
peeped
in
each
hole
to
each
chamber
stole
his
promising
to
view
grinning
applause
he
just
showed
them
his
claws
and
they
shrunk
with
affright
from
his
ugly
sight
whose
work
they
delighted
to
do
satan
poked
his
red
nose
into
crannies
so
small
one
would
think
that
the
innocents
fair
poor
lambkins
were
just
doing
nothing
at
all
but
settling
some
dress
or
arranging
some
ball
but
the
devil
saw
deeper
there
a
priest
at
whose
elbow
the
devil
during
prayer
sate
familiarly
side
by
side
declared
that
if
the
tempter
were
there
his
presence
he
would
not
abide
ah
ah
thought
old
nick
that
a
very
stale
trick
for
without
the

o
favourite
of
evil
in
your
carriage
you
would
not
ride
satan
next
saw
a
brainless
king
whose
house
was
as
hot
as
his
own
many
imps
in
attendance
were
there
on
the
wing
they
flapped
the
pennon
and
twisted
the
sting
close
by
the
very
throne
ah
ah
thought
satan
the
pasture
is
good
my
cattle
will
here
thrive
better
than
others
they
dine
on
news
of
human
blood
they
sup
on
the
groans
of
the
dying
and
dead
and
supperless
never
will
go
to
bed
which
will
make
them
fat
as
their

fat
as
the
fiends
that
feed
on

fresh
and
warm
from
the
fields
of
spain
where
ruin
ploughs
her
gory
way
where
the

nipped

hell
is
the
victor
prey
its

the

slain
fat
as
the
on
erin
shore
that
glutted
themselves
in
her
dearest
gore
and
flitted
round
castlereagh
when
they
snatched
the
patriot
heart
that
his
grasp
had
torn
from
its
widow
maniac
clasp
and
fled
at
the
dawn
of
day
fat
as
the
reptiles
of
the
tomb
that
riot
in
corruption
spoil
that
fret
their
little
hour
in
gloom
and
creep
and
live
the
while
fat
as
that
prince
maudlin
brain
which
addled
by
some
gilded
toy
tired
gives
his
sweetmeat
and
again
cries
for
it

boy
for
he
is
fat
his

strained
upon
a
levee
day
scarce
meets
across
his
princely
paunch

how
vast
his
stock
of
calf

filled
his

a

the

through

low

the

they
are
big
the
lawyers
thrive
though
they

the

of
this
poem
is

here
as
being
that
which
shelley
actually
published
in
order
to
reconvert
the
text
of
the
revolt
of

into
that
of
laon
and
cythna
the
reader
must
make
the
following
alterations
in
the
text
at
the
end
of
the
preface
add
the
personal
conduct
of
my
hero
and
heroine
there
is
one
circumstance
which
was
intended
to
startle
the
reader
from
the
trance
of
ordinary
life
it
was
my
object
to
break
through
the
crust
of
those
outworn
opinions
on
which
established
institutions
depend
i
have
appealed
therefore
to
the
most
universal
of
all
feelings
and
have
endeavoured
to
strengthen
the
moral
sense
by
forbidding
it
to
waste
its
energies
in
seeking
to
avoid
actions
which
are
only
crimes
of
convention
it
is
because
there
is
so
great
a
multitude
of
artificial
vices
that
there
are
so
few
real
virtues
those
feelings
alone
which
are
benevolent
or
malevolent
are
essentially
good
or
bad
the
circumstance
of
which
i
speak
was
introduced
however
merely
to
accustom
men
to
that
charity
and
toleration
which
the
exhibition
of
a
practice
widely
differing
from
their
own
has
a
tendency
to
promote
the
sentiments
connected
with
and
characteristic
of
this
circumstance
have
no
personal
reference
to
the
shelley
note
nothing
indeed
can
be
more
mischievous
than
many
actions
innocent
in
themselves
which
might
bring
down
upon
individuals
the
bigoted
contempt
and
rage
of
the
multitude
i
had
a
little
sister
whose
fair
eyes
to
love
in
human
life
this
sister

what
thoughts
had
sway
over
my
sister

as
if
they
did
ten
thousand
years
outnumber

left
it
vacant
was
her
brother
face
i
had
a
brother
once
but
he
is
dead
my
own
sweet
sister

quail

common
blood
which
ran
within
our
frames

such
close
sympathies

of

smother

he

a

to
wreak

god

happy
conjecture
clod
seems
to
forman
doubtful
emendation
as
shelley
may
have
used
clog
in
its
figurative
sense
of
weight
encumbrance
hardly
as
here
in
a
poetical
figure
that
would
be
to
use
a
metaphor
within
a
metaphor
shelley
compares
his
heart
to
a
concrete
object
if
clog
is
right
the
word
must
be
taken
in
one
or
other
of
its
two
recognized
literal
senses
wooden
shoe
or
block
of
wood
tied
round
the
neck
or
to
the
leg
of
a
horse
or
a
dog
again
it
is
of
others
hearts
not
of
his
own
that
shelley
here
deplores
the
icy
coldness
and
weight
besides
how
could
he
appropriately
describe
his
heart
as
a
weight
or
encumbrance
upon
the
free
play
of
impulse
and
emotion
seeing
that
for
shelley
above
all
men
the
heart
was
itself
the
main
source
and
spring
of
all
feeling
and
action
that
source
he
complains
has
been
dried
up
its
emotions
desiccated
by
the
crushing
impact
of
other
hearts
heavy
hard
and
cold
as
stone
his
heart
has
become
withered
and
barren
like
a
lump
of
earth
parched
with
frost
lifeless
clod
compare
summer
and
winter
lines
was
a
winter
such
as
when
birds
die
in
the
deep
forests
and
the
fishes
lie
stiffened
in
the
translucent
ice
which
makes
even
the
mud
and
slime
of
the
warm
lakes
a
wrinkled
clod
as
hard
as
brick
etc
the
word
revived
suits
well
with
clod
but
what
is
a
revived
clog
finally
the
first
two
lines
of
the
following
stanza
seem
decisive
in
favour
of
roseetti
word
if
any
one
wonders
how
a
misprint
overlooked
in
could
after
years
still
remain
undiscovered
in
let
him
consider
the
case
of
clog
in
lamb
parody
on
southey
and
coleridge
dactyls
lamb
letter
to
coleridge
july
sorely
your
dactyls
do
drag
along
sad
is
the
measure
that
hangs
a
clog
round
so
etc
here
the
misprint
clod
which
in
appeared
in
moxon
edition
of
the
letters
of
charles
lamb
has
through
five
successive
editions
and
under
many
editors
including
fitzgerald
ainger
and
macdonald
held
its
ground
even
to
the
present
day
and
this
notwithstanding
the
preservation
of
the
true
reading
clog
in
the
texts
of
talfourd
and
carew
hazlitt
here
then
is
the
case
of
a
palpable
misprint
surviving
despite
positive
external
evidence
of
its
falsity
over
a
period
of
years
and
walked
as
free
etc
ded
walked
is
one
of
shelley
occasional
grammatical
laxities
forman
well
observes
that
walkedst
the
right
word
here
would
naturally
seem
to
shelley
more
heinous
than
a
breach
of
syntactic
rule
rossetti
and
after
him
dowden
print
walk
forman
and
woodberry
follow
the
early
texts
here
the
text
follows
the
punctuation
of
the
editio
princeps
with
two
exceptions
a
comma
is
inserted
after
scale
line
on
the
authority
of
the
bodleian

locock
and
after
neck
line
to
indicate
the
true
construction
text
has
a
semicolon
after
plumes
line
which
rossetti

forman
departs
from
the
pointing
of

edition
here
placing
a
period
at
the
close
of

and
a
dash
after
blended
line
what

the

here
and
now

are
embarked

that
gleams
below
a

and
dim
expanse
as
the

we
go
with
woodberry
i
substitute
after
embarked
a
dash
for
the
comma
of
the

with
rossetti
i
restore
to
below
a
comma
which
i
believe
to
have
been
overlooked
by
the
printer
of
that
edition
shelley
meaning
i
take
to
be
that
vast
and
dim
expanse
of

frowning
over
the

gleams
below
it
as
we

the

to

no

the

the
manuscript
of
what
he
justly
terms
a
comma
after
soon
mine
shook

the
wide
emotion
for
emotion
the
bodleian

has
commotion
locock
perhaps
the
fitter
word
here
deep
slumber
fell
on
me
my
dreams
were
fire
the
dash
after
fire
is
from
the
bodleian
manuscript
where
moreover
the
somewhat
misleading
but
indubitably
shelleyan
comma
after
passion
editio
princeps
is
wanting
locock
i
have
added
a
dash
to
the
comma
after
cover
in
order
to
clarify
the
sense
and
shared
in
fearless
deeds
with
evil
men
with
forman
and
dowden
i
substitute
here
a
comma

the

loved

the
comma
here
important
as
marking
the
sense
as
well
as
the
rhythm
of
the
passage
is
derived
from
the
bodleian
manuscript
locock
i
looked
and
we
were
sailing
pleasantly
swift
as
a
cloud
between
the
sea
and
sky
beneath
the
rising
moon
seen
far
away
mountains
of
ice
etc
the
editio
princeps
has
a
comma
after
sky
and
a
semicolon
after
away
a
pointing
followed
by
forman
dowden
and
woodberry
by
transposing
these
points
as
in
our
text
however
a
much
better
sense
is
obtained
and
luckily
this
better
sense
proves
to
be
that
yielded
by
the
bodleian
manuscript
where
locock
reports
there
is
a
semicolon
after
sky
a
comma
after
moon
and
no
point
whatsoever
after
away
girt
by
the
deserts
of
the
universe
so
the
bodleian
manuscript
anticipated
by
woodberry
rossetti
had
substituted
a
comma
for
the
period
of
editio
princeps
hymns
which
my
soul
had
woven
to
freedom
strong
the
source
of
passion
whence
they
rose
to
be
triumphant
strains
which
etc
the
editio

followed
by

has
passion
whence
shelley

both

prints
strong
the
source
of

whence
they
rose
to
be
triumphant

which
etc
but
pale
were
calm
with

thus
subdued
etc
with
rossetti
dowden
woodberry
i
add
a
comma
after
but
to
the
pointing
of
the

princeps
shelley
poetical
works
both

methought

shelley

which
is
retained
by

but
cf
dowden

rossetti

so

an
oversight
perpetuated

the
name

notwithstanding
with

i
print

obvious
emendation
proposed
by

thus

unexpected

etc
with
forman
dowden
woodberry
i
substitute
after
isle
a
comma
for
the
full
stop
of

retained
by
rossetti
the
passage
is
obscure
perhaps
shelley
wrote
many
a
the
plain
becomes
studded
in
an
instant
with
piles
of
corpses
even
as
the

surface
of

will
sometimes
become
studded
in
an
instant
with
many
islands
uplifted
by
a
sudden
shock
of

the
editio
princeps
punctuates
thus
and
words
it
gave
gestures
and
looks
such
as
in
whirlwinds
bore
which
might
not
be
withstood
whence
none
could
save
all
who
approached
their
sphere
like
some
calm
wave
vexed
into
whirlpools
by
the
chasms
beneath
this
punctuation
is
retained
by
forman
rossetti
dowden
woodberry
place
a
comma
after
gave
and
gestures
and
adopting
the
suggestion
of
bradley
enclose
line
which
might
could
save
in
parentheses
thus
construing
which
might
not
be
withstood
and
whence
none
could
save
as
adjectival
clauses
qualifying
whirlwinds
and
taking
bore
as
a
transitive
verb
governing
all
who
approached
their
sphere
this
which
i
believe
to
be
the
true
construction
is
perhaps
indicated
quite
as
clearly
by
the
pointing
adopted
in
the
text
a
pointing
moreover
which
on
metrical
grounds
is
i
think
preferable
to
that
proposed
by
bradley
i
have
added
a
dash
to
the
comma
after
sphere
to
indicate
that
it
is
cythna
herself
and
not
all
who
approached

that
resembles
some

undoubtedly
shelley

a
conjectural
emendation
by
a
certain
campbell
mauritius

the

cf

shelley

punctuation
leaves
the
construction
ambiguous
with
woodberry
the
two
clauses
are
seen
to
be
parallel
the
latter
being
appositive
to
and
explanatory
of
the
former
while
with
dowden
the

are
placed
in
correlation

all

prior

the
important
emendation
lorn
was
first
introduced
into
the
text
by
forman
from
shelley
revised
copy
of
laon
and
cythna
where
lone
is
found
to
be
turned
into
lorn
by
the
poet
own
hand
and
hate
is
throned
on
high
with
fear
her
mother
etc
so
the
editio

forman
dowden
woodberry
following
the
text
of

cythna
read
fear
his
mother
forman
refers
to
where
fear
figures
as
a
female
and
hate
as
mate
and
foe
but
consistency
in
such
matters
was
not
one
of
characteristics

there
seems
to
be
no
need
for
alteration

suggests
that

these
stanzas
occur
in
the
esdaile

intended

shelley
bertram
dobell
rossetti

however
incline
to
think
that
we
have
here
an
address
by
shelley
in
a
despondent
mood
to
his
own
spirit
lines
these
appear
to
be
antedated

they

allude
to
the

the

version
of
these

shelley
failure
to
cancel
the
whole

was
due
locock
rightly
argues
to
inadvertence
merely
instead
of
buffaloes
the
manuscript
gives
the
buffalo
and
it
supplies
the
line
locock
which
closes
the
stanza
in
our
text
and
with
which
locock
aptly
compares

the
testimony
of
shelley
autograph
in
the
harvard

manuscript
however
is
final
against
such
a
punctuation

locock
tells
us
the

are
doubtful
many
of
them
being
vaguely
altered
with
pen
and
pencil
shelley
evidently
hesitated
between
two
or
three
alternative
ways
of
indicating
the
structure
and
corresponding
parts
of
his
elaborate
song
hence
the
chaotic
jumble
of
headings
printed
in
editions
so
far
as
the
epodes
are
concerned
the
headings
in
this
edition
are
those
of
editions
which
may
be
taken
as
supported
by
the
manuscript
locock
as
to
the
remaining
sections
locock
examination
of
the
manuscript
leads
him
to
conclude
that
shelley
final
choice
was
strophe
antistrophe
antistrophe
antistrophe
alpha
antistrophe
alpha
this
in
itself
would
be
perfectly
appropriate
but
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
method
employed
in
designating
the
epodes
i
have
therefore
adopted
in
preference
a
scheme
which
if
it
lacks
manuscript
authority
in
some
particulars
has
at
least
the
merit
of
being
absolutely
logical
and
consistent
throughout
locock
has
some
interesting
remarks
on
the
metrical
features
of
this
complex
ode
on
the
line
of
antistrophe
line
of
the
ode
aghast

pass
from
the
earth
disk
which
exceeds
by
one
foot
the
lines
of
the
two
corresponding
divisions
strophe
and
antistrophe
he
observes
happily
enough
that
may
well
have
been
intended
to
disappear
locock
does
not
seem
to
notice
that
the
closing
lines
of
these
three
answering
sections
hail
hail
all
hail
thou
shalt
be
great
all
hail
art
thou
of
all
these

hail
increase
by
regular

iambi
nor
does
he
seem
quite
to
grasp
shelley
intention
with
regard
to
the
rhyme
scheme
of
the
other
triple
group
strophe
antistrophe
antistrophe
that
of
strophe
may
be
thus
expressed
between
this
and
antistrophe
the
second
member
of
the
group
there
is
a
general
correspondence
with
in
one
particular
a
subtle
modification
the
scheme
now
becomes
the
rhymes
of
lines
and
are
transposed
god
line
answering
to
the
halfway
rhymes
of
lines
and
gawd
and
unawed
instead
of
as
in
strophe
to
the
of
lines
and
and
vice
versa
fate
line
answering
to
desolate
and
state
lines
and
instead
of
to
the
halfway
rhymes
aforesaid
as
to
antistrophe
that
follows
antistrophe
so
far
as
it
goes
but
after
line
it
breaks
off
suddenly
and
closes
with
two
lines
corresponding
in
length
and
rhyme
to
the
closing
couplet
of
antistrophe
the
section
immediately
preceding
which
however
belongs
not
to
this
group
but
to
the
other
locock
speaks
of
line
as
rhymeless

i
stood

stood

went
into

sleep
i
would
not
be

enough
if
gibbets

if
i
esteemed
you
less

would

on

lips
i
slept
on

night
and

once
early
in
the
morning
one
sung
of
thee
who
left
the
tale
untold
one
word
is
too
often
profaned
orphan
hours
the
year
is
dead
our
boat
is
asleep
on

our
spoil
is
won
out
of
the
eastern
shadow
of
the
earth
over
the

at

i

thou

one
beloved

rarely
rarely
comest
thou
reach
me
that
handkerchief
my
brain
is
hurt
returning
from
its
daily
quest
my
spirit
rome
has
fallen
ye
see
it
lying
rough

that
moanest
loud
sacred
goddess
mother

see
yon
opening

serene
in
his
unconquerable
might
shall
we
roam
my
love
she
comes
not

i
left
her
even
now
she
left
me
at
the
silent
time
she
saw
me
not
she
heard
me
not
alone
she
was
an
aged
woman
and
the
years
silence
oh
well
are
death
and
sleep
and
thou
silver
key
of
the
fountain
of
tears
sing
muse
the
son
of
maia
and
of
jove
sleep
sleep
on
forget
thy
pain
so
now
my
summer
task
is
ended
mary
so
we
sate
joyous
as
the
morning
ray
stern
stern
is
the
voice
of
fate
fearful
command
such
hope
as
is
the
sick
despair
of
good
such
was
zonoras
and
as
daylight
finds
summer
was
dead
and
autumn
was
expiring
sweet
spirit
sister
of
that
orphan
one
sweet
star
which
gleaming
the
darksome
scene
swift
as
a
spirit
hastening
to
his
task
swifter
far
than
summer
flight
swiftly
walk
the
western
wave
tell
me
thou
star
whose
wings
of
light
that
matter
of
the
murder
is
hushed
up
that
night
we
anchored
in
a
woody
bay
that
time
is
dead
for
ever
child
the
awful
shadow
of
some
unseen
power
the
babe
is
at
peace
within
the
womb
the
billows
on
the
beach
are
leaping
around
it
the
cold
earth
slept
below
the
curtain
of
the
universe
the
beats
the
death
knell
is
ringing
the
devil
i
safely
can
aver
the
devil
now
knew
his
proper
cue
the
elements
respect
their
maker
seal
the
everlasting
universe
of
things
the
fierce
beasts
of
the
woods
and
wildernesses
the
fiery
mountains
answer
each
other
the
fitful
alternations
of
the
rain
the
flower
that
smiles
the
fountains
mingle
with
the
river
the
gentleness
of
rain
was
in
the
wind
the
golden
gates
of
sleep
unbar
the
joy
the
triumph
the
delight
the
madness
the
keen
stars
were
twinkling
the
odour
from
the
flower
is
gone
the
old
man
took
the
oars
and
soon
the
bark
the
pale
stars
are
gone
the
pale
stars
of
the
morn
the
pale
the
cold
and
the
moony
smile
the
path
through
which
that
lovely
twain
the
rose
that
drinks
the
fountain
dew
the
rude
wind
is
singing
the
season
was
the
childhood
of
sweet
june
the
serpent
is
shut
out
from
paradise
the
sleepless
hours
who
watch
me
as
i
lie
the
spider
spreads
her
webs
whether
she
be
the
starlight
smile
of
children
the
sweet
looks
the
stars
may
dissolve
and
the
fountain
of
light
the
sun
is
set
the
swallows
are
asleep
the
sun
is
warm
the
sky
is
clear
the
sun
makes
music
as
of
old
the
transport
of
a
fierce
and
monstrous
gladness
the
viewless
and
invisible
consequence
the
voice
of
the
spirits
of
air
and
of
earth
the
warm
sun
is
failing
the
bleak
wind
is
wailing
the
waters
are
flashing
the
wind
has
swept
from
the
wide
atmosphere
the
world
is
dreary
the
world
is
now
our
the
world
great
age
begins
anew
then
weave
the
web
of
the
mystic
measure
there
is
a
voice
not
understood
by
all
there
is
a
warm
and
gentle
atmosphere
there
late
was
one
within
whose
subtle
being
there
was
a
little
lawny
islet
there
was
a
youth
who
as
with
toil
and
travel
these
are
two
friends
whose
lives
were
undivided
they
die
the
dead
return
not
misery
those
whom
nor
power
nor
lying
faith
nor
toil
thou
art
fair
and
few
are
fairer
thou
art
the
wine
whose
drunkenness
is
all
thou
living
light
that
in
thy
rainbow
hues
thou
supreme
goddess
by
whose
power
divine
thou
wert
not
cassius
and
thou
couldst
not
be
thou
wert
the
morning
star
among
the
living
thrice
three
hundred
thousand
years
thus
to
be
lost
and
thus
to
sink
and
die
thy
beauty
hangs
around
thee
like
thy
country
curse
is
on
thee
darkest
crest
thy
dewy
looks
sink
in
my
breast
thy
little
footsteps
on
the
sands
thy
look
of
love
has
power
to
calm
midnight
now
athwart
the
murky
air
the
terror
of
tempest
the
rags
of
the
sail
to
me
this
world
a
dreary
blank
to
the
deep
to
the
deep
to
thirst
and
find
no
fill
to
wail
and
wander
tremble
kings
despised
of
man
at
the
season
when
the
earth
upsprings
at
this
season
that
prince
athanase
dead
of
the
night
when
i
sat
in
my
dwelling
dead
of
the
night
when
i
sate
in
my
dwelling
unfathomable
sea
whose
waves
are
years
unrisen
splendour
of
the
brightest
sun
vessels
of
heavenly
medicine
may
the
breeze
victorious
wrong
with
vulture
scream
wake
the
serpent
not
lest
he
was
there
a
human
spirit
in
the
steed
we
are
as
clouds
that
veil
the
midnight
moon
we
come
from
the
mind
we
join
the
throng
we
meet
not
as
we
parted
we
strew
these
opiate
flowers
wealth
and
dominion
fade
into
the
mass
weave
the
dance
on
the
floor
of
the
breeze
weep
not
my
gentle
boy
he
struck
but
me
what
alive
and
so
bold
o
earth
what
art
thou
presumptuous
who
profanest
what
mary
is
when
she
a
little
smiles
what
men
gain
fairly
that
they
should
possess
think
you
the
dead
are
what
thoughts
had
sway
cythna
lonely
slumber
what
was
the
shriek
that
struck
fancy
ear
when
a
lover
clasps
his
fairest
when
may
is
painting
with
her
colours
gay
when
passion
trance
is
overpast
when
soft
winds
and
sunny
skies
when
the
lamp
is
shattered
when
the
last
hope
of
trampled
france
had
failed
when
winds
that
move
not
its
calm
surface
sweep
where
art
thou
beloved
where
man
profane
and
tainting
hand
whose
is
the
love
that
gleaming
through
the
world
why
is
it
said
thou
canst
not
live
wild
pale
and
even
as
one
wilt
thou
forget
the
happy
hours
within
a
cavern
of
man
trackless
spirit
worlds
on
worlds
are
rolling
ever
would
i
were
the
winged
cloud
ye
congregated
powers
of
heaven
who
share
ye
dorian
woods
and
waves
lament
aloud
ye
gentle
visitations
of
calm
thought
ye
hasten
to
the
grave
what
seek
ye
there
ye
who
intelligent
the
third
heaven
move
ye
muses
sing
the
twins
of
jove
yes
all
is
past
swift
time
has
fled
away
yes
often
when
the
eyes
are
cold
and
dry
yet
look
on
me
take
not
thine
eyes
away
you
said
that
spirits
spoke
but
it
was
thee
your
call
was
as
a
winged
car
