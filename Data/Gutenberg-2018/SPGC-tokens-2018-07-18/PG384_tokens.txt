i
the
new
lodgers
at
no
philibert
place
there
are
many
dreary
and
dingy
rows
of
ugly
houses
in
certain
parts
of
london
but
there
certainly
could
not
be
any
row
more
ugly
or
dingier
than
philibert
place
there
were
stories
that
it
had
once
been
more
attractive
but
that
had
been
so
long
ago
that
no
one
remembered
the
time
it
stood
back
in
its
gloomy
narrow
strips
of
smoky
gardens
whose
broken
iron
railings
were
supposed
to
protect
it
from
the
surging
traffic
of
a
road
which
was
always
roaring
with
the
rattle
of
busses
cabs
drays
and
vans
and
the
passing
of
people
who
were
shabbily
dressed
and
looked
as
if
they
were
either
going
to
hard
work
or
coming
from
it
or
hurrying
to
see
if
they
could
find
some
of
it
to
do
to
keep
themselves
from
going
hungry
the
brick
fronts
of
the
houses
were
blackened
with
smoke
their
windows
were
nearly
all
dirty
and
hung
with
dingy
curtains
or
had
no
curtains
at
all
the
strips
of
ground
which
had
once
been
intended
to
grow
flowers
in
had
been
trodden
down
into
bare
earth
in
which
even
weeds
had
forgotten
to
grow
one
of
them
was
used
as
a
yard
and
cheap
monuments
crosses
and
slates
were
set
out
for
sale
bearing
inscriptions
beginning
with
sacred
to
the
memory
of
another
had
piles
of
old
lumber
in
it
another
exhibited
furniture
chairs
with
unsteady
legs
sofas
with
horsehair
stuffing
bulging
out
of
holes
in
their
covering
mirrors
with
blotches
or
cracks
in
them
the
insides
of
the
houses
were
as
gloomy
as
the
outside
they
were
all
exactly
alike
in
each
a
dark
entrance
passage
led
to
narrow
stairs
going
up
to
bedrooms
and
to
narrow
steps
going
down
to
a
basement
kitchen
the
back
bedroom
looked
out
on
small
sooty
flagged
yards
where
thin
cats
quarreled
or
sat
on
the
coping
of
the
brick
walls
hoping
that
sometime
they
might
feel
the
sun
the
front
rooms
looked
over
the
noisy
road
and
through
their
windows
came
the
roar
and
rattle
of
it
it
was
shabby
and
cheerless
on
the
brightest
days
and
on
foggy
or
rainy
ones
it
was
the
most
forlorn
place
in
london
at
least
that
was
what
one
boy
thought
as
he
stood
near
the
iron
railings
watching
the
on
the
morning
on
which
this
story
begins
which
was
also
the
morning
after
he
had
been
brought
by
his
father
to
live
as
a
lodger
in
the
back
of
the
house
no
he
was
a
boy
about
twelve
years
old
his
name
was
marco
loristan
and
he
was
the
kind
of
boy
people
look
at
a
second
time
when
they
have
looked
at
him
once
in
the
first
place
he
was
a
very
big
boy
tall
for
his
years
and
with
a
particularly
strong
frame
his
shoulders
were
broad
and
his
arms
and
legs
were
long
and
powerful
he
was
quite
used
to
hearing
people
say
as
they
glanced
at
him
what
a
fine
big
lad
and
then
they
always
looked
again
at
his
face
it
was
not
an
english
face
or
an
american
one
and
was
very
dark
in
coloring
his
features
were
strong
his
black
hair
grew
on
his
head
like
a
mat
his
eyes
were
large
and
deep
set
and
looked
out
between
thick
straight
black
lashes
he
was
as
a
boy
as
one
could
imagine
and
an
observing
person
would
have
been
struck
at
once
by
a
sort
of
look
expressed
by
his
whole
face
a
look
which
suggested
that
he
was
not
a
boy
who
talked
much
this
look
was
specially
noticeable
this
morning
as
he
stood
before
the
iron
railings
the
things
he
was
thinking
of
were
of
a
kind
likely
to
bring
to
the
face
of
a
boy
an
unboyish
expression
he
was
thinking
of
the
long
hurried
journey
he
and
his
father
and
their
old
soldier
servant
lazarus
had
made
during
the
last
few
days
the
journey
from
russia
cramped
in
a
close
railway
carriage
they
had
dashed
across
the
continent
as
if
something
important
or
terrible
were
driving
them
and
here
they
were
settled
in
london
as
if
they
were
going
to
live
forever
at
no
philibert
place
he
knew
however
that
though
they
might
stay
a
year
it
was
just
as
probable
that
in
the
middle
of
some
night
his
father
or
lazarus
might
waken
him
from
his
sleep
and
say
get
up
dress
yourself
quickly
we
must
go
at
once
a
few
days
later
he
might
be
in
petersburg
berlin
vienna
or
budapest
huddled
away
in
some
poor
little
house
as
shabby
and
comfortless
as
no
philibert
place
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
as
he
thought
of
it
and
watched
the
busses
his
strange
life
and
his
close
association
with
his
father
had
made
him
much
older
than
his
years
but
he
was
only
a
boy
after
all
and
the
mystery
of
things
sometimes
weighed
heavily
upon
him
and
set
him
to
deep
wondering
in
not
one
of
the
many
countries
he
knew
had
he
ever
met
a
boy
whose
life
was
in
the
least
like
his
own
other
boys
had
homes
in
which
they
spent
year
after
year
they
went
to
school
regularly
and
played
with
other
boys
and
talked
openly
of
the
things
which
happened
to
them
and
the
journeys
they
made
when
he
remained
in
a
place
long
enough
to
make
a
few
he
knew
he
must
never
forget
that
his
whole
existence
was
a
sort
of
secret
whose
safety
depended
upon
his
own
silence
and
discretion
this
was
because
of
the
promises
he
had
made
to
his
father
and
they
had
been
the
first
thing
he
remembered
not
that
he
had
ever
regretted
anything
connected
with
his
father
he
threw
his
black
head
up
as
he
thought
of
that
none
of
the
other
boys
had
such
a
father
not
one
of
them
his
father
was
his
idol
and
his
chief
he
had
scarcely
ever
seen
him
when
his
clothes
had
not
been
poor
and
shabby
but
he
had
also
never
seen
him
when
despite
his
worn
coat
and
frayed
linen
he
had
not
stood
out
among
all
others
as
more
distinguished
than
the
most
noticeable
of
them
when
he
walked
down
a
street
people
turned
to
look
at
him
even
oftener
than
they
turned
to
look
at
marco
and
the
boy
felt
as
if
it
was
not
merely
because
he
was
a
big
man
with
a
handsome
dark
face
but
because
he
looked
somehow
as
if
he
had
been
born
to
command
armies
and
as
if
no
one
would
think
of
disobeying
him
yet
marco
had
never
seen
him
command
any
one
and
they
had
always
been
poor
and
shabbily
dressed
and
often
enough
but
whether
they
were
in
one
country
or
another
and
whatsoever
dark
place
they
seemed
to
be
hiding
in
the
few
people
they
saw
treated
him
with
a
sort
of
deference
and
nearly
always
stood
when
they
were
in
his
presence
unless
he
bade
them
sit
down
it
is
because
they
know
he
is
a
patriot
and
patriots
are
respected
the
boy
had
told
himself
he
himself
wished
to
be
a
patriot
though
he
had
never
seen
his
own
country
of
samavia
he
knew
it
well
however
his
father
had
talked
to
him
about
it
ever
since
that
day
when
he
had
made
the
promises
he
had
taught
him
to
know
it
by
helping
him
to
study
curious
detailed
maps
of
it
maps
of
its
cities
maps
of
its
mountains
maps
of
its
roads
he
had
told
him
stories
of
the
wrongs
done
its
people
of
their
sufferings
and
struggles
for
liberty
and
above
all
of
their
unconquerable
courage
when
they
talked
together
of
its
history
marco
burned
and
leaped
in
his
veins
and
he
always
knew
by
the
look
in
his
eyes
that
his
blood
burned
also
his
countrymen
had
been
killed
they
had
been
robbed
they
had
died
by
thousands
of
cruelties
and
starvation
but
their
souls
had
never
been
conquered
and
through
all
the
years
during
which
more
powerful
nations
crushed
and
enslaved
them
they
never
ceased
to
struggle
to
free
themselves
and
stand
unfettered
as
samavians
had
stood
centuries
before
why
do
we
not
live
there
marco
had
cried
on
the
day
the
promises
were
made
why
do
we
not
go
back
and
fight
when
i
am
a
man
i
will
be
a
soldier
and
die
for
samavia
we
are
of
those
who
must
for
samavia
working
day
and
night
his
father
had
answered
denying
ourselves
training
our
bodies
and
souls
using
our
brains
learning
the
things
which
are
best
to
be
done
for
our
people
and
our
country
even
exiles
may
be
samavian
soldiers
i
am
one
you
must
be
one
are
we
exiles
asked
marco
yes
was
the
answer
but
even
if
we
never
set
foot
on
samavian
soil
we
must
give
our
lives
to
it
i
have
given
mine
since
i
was
sixteen
i
shall
give
it
until
i
die
have
you
never
lived
there
said
marco
a
strange
look
shot
across
his
father
face
no
he
answered
and
said
no
more
marco
watching
him
knew
he
must
not
ask
the
question
again
the
next
words
his
father
said
were
about
the
promises
marco
was
quite
a
little
fellow
at
the
time
but
he
understood
the
solemnity
of
them
and
felt
that
he
was
being
honored
as
if
he
were
a
man
when
you
are
a
man
you
shall
know
all
you
wish
to
know
loristan
said
now
you
are
a
child
and
your
mind
must
not
be
burdened
but
you
must
do
your
part
a
child
sometimes
forgets
that
words
may
be
dangerous
you
must
promise
never
to
forget
this
wheresoever
you
are
if
you
have
playmates
you
must
remember
to
be
silent
about
many
things
you
must
not
speak
of
what
i
do
or
of
the
people
who
come
to
see
me
you
must
not
mention
the
things
in
your
life
which
make
it
different
from
the
lives
of
other
boys
you
must
keep
in
your
mind
that
a
secret
exists
which
a
chance
foolish
word
might
betray
you
are
a
samavian
and
there
have
been
samavians
who
have
died
a
thousand
deaths
rather
than
betray
a
secret
you
must
learn
to
obey
without
question
as
if
you
were
a
soldier
now
you
must
take
your
oath
of
allegiance
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
went
to
a
corner
of
the
room
he
knelt
down
turned
back
the
carpet
lifted
a
plank
and
took
something
from
beneath
it
it
was
a
sword
and
as
he
came
back
to
marco
he
drew
it
out
from
its
sheath
the
child
strong
little
body
stiffened
and
drew
itself
up
his
large
deep
eyes
flashed
he
was
to
take
his
oath
of
allegiance
upon
a
sword
as
if
he
were
a
man
he
did
not
know
that
his
small
hand
opened
and
shut
with
a
fierce
understanding
grip
because
those
of
his
blood
had
for
long
centuries
past
carried
swords
and
fought
with
them
loristan
gave
him
the
big
bared
weapon
and
stood
erect
before
him
repeat
these
words
after
me
sentence
by
sentence
he
commanded
and
as
he
spoke
them
marco
echoed
each
one
loudly
and
clearly
the
sword
in
my
hand
for
samavia
the
heart
in
my
breast
for
samavia
the
swiftness
of
my
sight
the
thought
of
my
brain
the
life
of
my
life
for
samavia
here
grows
a
man
for
samavia
god
be
thanked
then
loristan
put
his
hand
on
the
child
shoulder
and
his
dark
face
looked
almost
fiercely
proud
from
this
hour
he
said
you
and
i
are
comrades
at
arms
and
from
that
day
to
the
one
on
which
he
stood
beside
the
broken
iron
railings
of
no
philibert
place
marco
had
not
forgotten
for
one
hour
ii
a
young
citizen
of
the
world
he
had
been
in
london
more
than
once
before
but
not
to
the
lodgings
in
philibert
place
when
he
was
brought
a
second
or
third
time
to
a
town
or
city
he
always
knew
that
the
house
he
was
taken
to
would
be
in
a
quarter
new
to
him
and
he
should
not
see
again
the
people
he
had
seen
before
such
slight
links
of
acquaintance
as
sometimes
formed
themselves
between
him
and
other
children
as
shabby
and
poor
as
himself
were
easily
broken
his
father
however
had
never
forbidden
him
to
make
chance
acquaintances
he
had
in
fact
told
him
that
he
had
reasons
for
not
wishing
him
to
hold
himself
aloof
from
other
boys
the
only
barrier
which
must
exist
between
them
must
be
the
barrier
of
silence
concerning
his
wanderings
from
country
to
country
other
boys
as
poor
as
he
was
did
not
make
constant
journeys
therefore
they
would
miss
nothing
from
his
boyish
talk
when
he
omitted
all
mention
of
his
when
he
was
in
russia
he
must
speak
only
of
russian
places
and
russian
people
and
customs
when
he
was
in
france
germany
austria
or
england
he
must
do
the
same
thing
when
he
had
learned
english
french
german
italian
and
russian
he
did
not
know
he
had
seemed
to
grow
up
in
the
midst
of
changing
tongues
which
all
seemed
familiar
to
him
as
languages
are
familiar
to
children
who
have
lived
with
them
until
one
scarcely
seems
less
familiar
than
another
he
did
remember
however
that
his
father
had
always
been
unswerving
in
his
attention
to
his
pronunciation
and
method
of
speaking
the
language
of
any
country
they
chanced
to
be
living
in
you
must
not
seem
a
foreigner
in
any
country
he
had
said
to
him
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
not
but
when
you
are
in
england
you
must
not
know
french
or
german
or
anything
but
english
once
when
he
was
seven
or
eight
years
old
a
boy
had
asked
him
what
his
father
work
was
his
own
father
is
a
carpenter
and
he
asked
me
if
my
father
was
one
marco
brought
the
story
to
loristan
i
said
you
were
not
then
he
asked
if
you
were
a
shoemaker
and
another
one
said
you
might
be
a
bricklayer
or
a
tailor
and
i
did
know
what
to
tell
them
he
had
been
out
playing
in
a
london
street
and
he
put
a
grubby
little
hand
on
his
father
arm
and
clutched
and
almost
fiercely
shook
it
i
wanted
to
say
that
you
were
not
like
their
fathers
not
at
all
i
knew
you
were
not
though
you
were
quite
as
poor
you
are
not
a
bricklayer
or
a
shoemaker
but
a
patriot
you
could
not
be
only
a
bricklayer
you
he
said
it
grandly
and
with
a
queer
indignation
his
black
head
held
up
and
his
eyes
angry
loristan
laid
his
hand
against
his
mouth
hush
hush
he
said
is
it
an
insult
to
a
man
to
think
he
may
be
a
carpenter
or
make
a
good
suit
of
clothes
if
i
could
make
our
clothes
we
should
go
better
dressed
if
i
were
a
shoemaker
your
toes
would
not
be
making
their
way
into
the
world
as
they
are
now
he
was
smiling
but
marco
saw
his
head
held
itself
high
too
and
his
eyes
were
glowing
as
he
touched
his
shoulder
i
know
you
did
not
tell
them
i
was
a
patriot
he
ended
what
was
it
you
said
to
them
i
remembered
that
you
were
nearly
always
writing
and
drawing
maps
and
i
said
you
were
a
writer
but
i
did
not
know
what
you
wrote
and
that
you
said
it
was
a
poor
trade
i
heard
you
say
that
once
to
lazarus
was
that
a
right
thing
to
tell
them
yes
you
may
always
say
it
if
you
are
asked
there
are
poor
fellows
enough
who
write
a
thousand
different
things
which
bring
them
little
money
there
is
nothing
strange
in
my
being
a
writer
so
loristan
answered
him
and
from
that
time
if
by
any
chance
his
father
means
of
livelihood
were
inquired
into
it
was
simple
enough
and
true
enough
to
say
that
he
wrote
to
earn
his
bread
in
the
first
days
of
strangeness
to
a
new
place
marco
often
walked
a
great
deal
he
was
strong
and
untiring
and
it
amused
him
to
wander
through
unknown
streets
and
look
at
shops
and
houses
and
people
he
did
not
confine
himself
to
the
great
thoroughfares
but
liked
to
branch
off
into
the
side
streets
and
odd
squares
and
even
courts
and
alleyways
he
often
stopped
to
watch
workmen
and
talk
to
them
if
they
were
friendly
in
this
way
he
made
stray
acquaintances
in
his
strollings
and
learned
a
good
many
things
he
had
a
fondness
for
wandering
musicians
and
from
an
old
italian
who
had
in
his
youth
been
a
singer
in
opera
he
had
learned
to
sing
a
number
of
songs
in
his
strong
musical
he
knew
well
many
of
the
songs
of
the
people
in
several
countries
it
was
very
dull
this
first
morning
and
he
wished
that
he
had
something
to
do
or
some
one
to
speak
to
to
do
nothing
whatever
is
a
depressing
thing
at
all
times
but
perhaps
it
is
more
especially
so
when
one
is
a
big
healthy
boy
twelve
years
old
london
as
he
saw
it
in
the
marylebone
road
seemed
to
him
a
hideous
place
it
was
murky
and
and
full
of
people
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
seen
the
same
things
and
they
always
made
him
feel
that
he
wished
he
had
something
to
do
suddenly
he
turned
away
from
the
gate
and
went
into
the
house
to
speak
to
lazarus
he
found
him
in
his
dingy
closet
of
a
room
on
the
fourth
floor
at
the
back
of
the
house
i
am
going
for
a
walk
he
announced
to
him
please
tell
my
father
if
he
asks
for
me
he
is
busy
and
i
must
not
disturb
him
lazarus
was
patching
an
old
coat
as
he
often
patched
things
even
shoes
sometimes
when
marco
spoke
he
stood
up
at
once
to
answer
him
he
was
very
obstinate
and
particular
about
certain
forms
of
manner
nothing
would
have
obliged
him
to
remain
seated
when
loristan
or
marco
was
near
him
marco
thought
it
was
because
he
had
been
so
strictly
trained
as
a
soldier
he
knew
that
his
father
had
had
great
trouble
to
make
him
lay
aside
his
habit
of
saluting
when
they
spoke
to
him
perhaps
marco
had
heard
loristan
say
to
him
almost
severely
once
when
he
had
forgotten
himself
and
had
stood
at
salute
while
his
master
passed
through
a
iron
gate
before
an
equally
perhaps
you
can
force
yourself
to
remember
when
i
tell
you
that
it
is
not
safe
is
not
you
put
us
in
danger
it
was
evident
that
this
helped
the
good
fellow
to
control
himself
marco
remembered
that
at
the
time
he
had
actually
turned
pale
and
had
struck
his
forehead
and
poured
forth
a
torrent
of
samavian
dialect
in
penitence
and
terror
but
though
he
no
longer
saluted
them
in
public
he
omitted
no
other
form
of
reverence
and
ceremony
and
the
boy
had
become
accustomed
to
being
treated
as
if
he
were
anything
but
the
shabby
lad
whose
very
coat
was
patched
by
the
old
soldier
who
stood
at
attention
before
him
yes
sir
lazarus
answered
where
was
it
your
wish
to
go
marco
knitted
his
black
brows
a
little
in
trying
to
recall
distinct
memories
of
the
last
time
he
had
been
in
london
i
have
been
to
so
many
places
and
have
seen
so
many
things
since
i
was
here
before
that
i
must
begin
to
learn
again
about
the
streets
and
buildings
i
do
not
quite
remember
yes
sir
said
lazarus
there
been
so
many
i
also
forget
you
were
but
eight
years
old
when
you
were
last
here
i
think
i
will
go
and
find
the
royal
palace
and
then
i
will
walk
about
and
learn
the
names
of
the
streets
marco
said
yes
sir
answered
lazarus
and
this
time
he
made
his
military
salute
marco
lifted
his
right
hand
in
recognition
as
if
he
had
been
a
young
officer
most
boys
might
have
looked
awkward
or
theatrical
in
making
the
gesture
but
he
made
it
with
naturalness
and
ease
because
he
had
been
familiar
with
the
form
since
his
babyhood
he
had
seen
officers
returning
the
salutes
of
their
men
when
they
encountered
each
other
by
chance
in
the
streets
he
had
seen
princes
passing
sentries
on
their
way
to
their
carriages
more
august
personages
raising
the
quiet
recognizing
hand
to
their
helmets
as
they
rode
through
applauding
crowds
he
had
seen
many
royal
persons
and
many
royal
pageants
but
always
only
as
an
boy
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
crowd
of
common
people
an
energetic
lad
however
poor
can
not
spend
his
days
in
going
from
one
country
to
another
without
by
mere
chance
becoming
familiar
with
the
outer
life
of
royalties
and
courts
marco
had
stood
in
continental
thoroughfares
when
visiting
emperors
rode
by
with
glittering
soldiery
before
and
behind
them
and
a
populace
shouting
courteous
welcomes
he
knew
where
in
various
great
capitals
the
sentries
stood
before
kingly
or
princely
palaces
he
had
seen
certain
royal
faces
often
enough
to
know
them
well
and
to
be
ready
to
make
his
salute
when
particular
quiet
and
unattended
carriages
passed
him
by
it
is
well
to
know
them
it
is
well
to
observe
everything
and
to
train
one
self
to
remember
faces
and
circumstances
his
father
had
said
if
you
were
a
young
prince
or
a
young
man
training
for
a
diplomatic
career
you
would
be
taught
to
notice
and
remember
people
and
things
as
you
would
be
taught
to
speak
your
own
language
with
elegance
such
observation
would
be
your
most
practical
accomplishment
and
greatest
power
it
is
as
practical
for
one
man
as
another
for
a
poor
lad
in
a
patched
coat
as
for
one
whose
place
is
to
be
in
courts
as
you
can
not
be
educated
in
the
ordinary
way
you
must
learn
from
travel
and
the
world
you
must
lose
nothing
forget
nothing
it
was
his
father
who
had
taught
him
everything
and
he
had
learned
a
great
deal
loristan
had
the
power
of
making
all
things
interesting
to
fascination
to
marco
it
seemed
that
he
knew
everything
in
the
world
they
were
not
rich
enough
to
buy
many
books
but
loristan
knew
the
treasures
of
all
great
cities
the
resources
of
the
smallest
towns
together
he
and
his
boy
walked
through
the
endless
galleries
filled
with
the
wonders
of
the
world
the
pictures
before
which
through
centuries
an
unbroken
procession
of
almost
worshiping
eyes
had
passed
uplifted
because
his
father
made
the
pictures
seem
the
glowing
burning
work
of
men
whom
the
centuries
could
not
turn
to
dust
because
he
could
tell
the
stories
of
their
living
and
laboring
to
triumph
stories
of
what
they
felt
and
suffered
and
were
the
boy
became
as
familiar
with
the
old
masters
italian
german
french
dutch
english
spanish
as
he
was
with
most
of
the
countries
they
had
lived
in
they
were
not
merely
old
masters
to
him
but
men
who
were
great
men
who
seemed
to
him
to
have
wielded
beautiful
swords
and
held
high
splendid
lights
his
father
could
not
go
often
with
him
but
he
always
took
him
for
the
first
time
to
the
galleries
museums
libraries
and
historical
places
which
were
richest
in
treasures
of
art
beauty
or
story
then
having
seen
them
once
through
his
eyes
marco
went
again
and
again
alone
and
so
grew
intimate
with
the
wonders
of
the
world
he
knew
that
he
was
gratifying
a
wish
of
his
father
when
he
tried
to
train
himself
to
observe
all
things
and
forget
nothing
these
palaces
of
marvels
were
his
and
his
strange
but
rich
education
was
the
most
interesting
part
of
his
life
in
time
he
knew
exactly
the
places
where
the
great
rembrandts
vandykes
rubens
raphaels
tintorettos
or
frans
hals
hung
he
knew
whether
this
masterpiece
or
that
was
in
vienna
in
paris
in
venice
or
munich
or
rome
he
knew
stories
of
splendid
crown
jewels
of
old
armor
of
ancient
crafts
and
of
roman
relics
dug
up
from
beneath
the
foundations
of
old
german
cities
any
boy
wandering
to
amuse
himself
through
museums
and
palaces
on
free
days
could
see
what
he
saw
but
boys
living
fuller
and
less
lonely
lives
would
have
been
less
likely
to
concentrate
their
entire
minds
on
what
they
looked
at
and
also
less
likely
to
store
away
facts
with
the
determination
to
be
able
to
recall
at
any
moment
the
mental
shelf
on
which
they
were
laid
having
no
playmates
and
nothing
to
play
with
he
began
when
he
was
a
very
little
fellow
to
make
a
sort
of
game
out
of
his
rambles
through
and
the
places
which
whether
they
called
themselves
museums
or
not
were
storehouses
or
relics
of
antiquity
there
were
always
the
blessed
free
days
when
he
could
climb
any
marble
steps
and
enter
any
great
portal
without
paying
an
entrance
fee
once
inside
there
were
plenty
of
plainly
and
poorly
dressed
people
to
be
seen
but
there
were
not
often
boys
as
young
as
himself
who
were
not
attended
by
older
companions
quiet
and
orderly
as
he
was
he
often
found
himself
stared
at
the
game
he
had
created
for
himself
was
as
simple
as
it
was
absorbing
it
was
to
try
how
much
he
could
remember
and
clearly
describe
to
his
father
when
they
sat
together
at
night
and
talked
of
what
he
had
seen
these
night
talks
filled
his
happiest
hours
he
never
felt
lonely
then
and
when
his
father
sat
and
watched
him
with
a
certain
curious
and
deep
attention
in
his
dark
reflective
eyes
the
boy
was
utterly
comforted
and
content
sometimes
he
brought
back
rough
and
crude
sketches
of
objects
he
wished
to
ask
questions
about
and
loristan
could
always
relate
to
him
the
full
rich
story
of
the
thing
he
wanted
to
know
they
were
stories
made
so
splendid
and
full
of
color
in
the
telling
that
marco
could
not
forget
them
iii
the
legend
of
the
lost
prince
as
he
walked
through
the
streets
he
was
thinking
of
one
of
these
stories
it
was
one
he
had
heard
first
when
he
was
very
young
and
it
had
so
seized
upon
his
imagination
that
he
had
asked
often
for
it
it
was
indeed
a
part
of
the
history
of
samavia
and
he
had
loved
it
for
that
reason
lazarus
had
often
told
it
to
him
sometimes
adding
much
detail
but
he
had
always
liked
best
his
father
version
which
seemed
a
thrilling
and
living
thing
on
their
journey
from
russia
during
an
hour
when
they
had
been
forced
to
wait
in
a
cold
wayside
station
and
had
found
the
time
long
loristan
had
discussed
it
with
him
he
always
found
some
such
way
of
making
hard
and
comfortless
hours
easier
to
live
through
fine
big
lad
for
a
foreigner
marco
heard
a
man
say
to
his
companion
as
he
passed
them
this
morning
looks
like
a
pole
or
a
russian
it
was
this
which
had
led
his
thoughts
back
to
the
story
of
the
lost
prince
he
knew
that
most
of
the
people
who
looked
at
him
and
called
him
a
foreigner
had
not
even
heard
of
samavia
those
who
chanced
to
recall
its
existence
knew
of
it
only
as
a
small
fierce
country
so
placed
upon
the
map
that
the
larger
countries
which
were
its
neighbors
felt
they
must
control
and
keep
it
in
order
and
therefore
made
incursions
into
it
and
fought
its
people
and
each
other
for
possession
but
it
had
not
been
always
so
it
was
an
old
old
country
and
hundreds
of
years
ago
it
had
been
as
celebrated
for
its
peaceful
happiness
and
wealth
as
for
its
beauty
it
was
often
said
that
it
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
places
in
the
world
a
favorite
samavian
legend
was
that
it
had
been
the
site
of
the
garden
of
eden
in
those
past
centuries
its
people
had
been
of
such
great
stature
physical
beauty
and
strength
that
they
had
been
like
a
race
of
noble
giants
they
were
in
those
days
a
pastoral
people
whose
rich
crops
and
splendid
flocks
and
herds
were
the
envy
of
less
fertile
countries
among
the
shepherds
and
herdsmen
there
were
poets
who
sang
their
own
songs
when
they
piped
among
their
sheep
upon
the
mountain
sides
and
in
the
valleys
their
songs
had
been
about
patriotism
and
bravery
and
faithfulness
to
their
chieftains
and
their
country
the
simple
courtesy
of
the
poorest
peasant
was
as
stately
as
the
manner
of
a
noble
but
that
as
loristan
had
said
with
a
tired
smile
had
been
before
they
had
had
time
to
outlive
and
forget
the
garden
of
eden
five
hundred
years
ago
there
had
succeeded
to
the
throne
a
king
who
was
bad
and
weak
his
father
had
lived
to
be
ninety
years
old
and
his
son
had
grown
tired
of
waiting
in
samavia
for
his
crown
he
had
gone
out
into
the
world
and
visited
other
countries
and
their
courts
when
he
returned
and
became
king
he
lived
as
no
samavian
king
had
lived
before
he
was
an
extravagant
vicious
man
of
furious
temper
and
bitter
jealousies
he
was
jealous
of
the
larger
courts
and
countries
he
had
seen
and
tried
to
introduce
their
customs
and
their
ambitions
he
ended
by
introducing
their
worst
faults
and
vices
there
arose
political
quarrels
and
savage
new
factions
money
was
squandered
until
poverty
began
for
the
first
time
to
stare
the
country
in
the
face
the
big
samavians
after
their
first
stupefaction
broke
forth
into
furious
rage
there
were
mobs
and
riots
then
bloody
battles
since
it
was
the
king
who
had
worked
this
wrong
they
would
have
none
of
him
they
would
depose
him
and
make
his
son
king
in
his
place
it
was
at
this
part
of
the
story
that
marco
was
always
most
deeply
interested
the
young
prince
was
totally
unlike
his
father
he
was
a
true
royal
samavian
he
was
bigger
and
stronger
for
his
age
than
any
man
in
the
country
and
he
was
as
handsome
as
a
young
viking
god
more
than
this
he
had
a
lion
heart
and
before
he
was
sixteen
the
shepherds
and
herdsmen
had
already
begun
to
make
songs
about
his
young
valor
and
his
kingly
courtesy
and
generous
kindness
not
only
the
shepherds
and
herdsmen
sang
them
but
the
people
in
the
streets
the
king
his
father
had
always
been
jealous
of
him
even
when
he
was
only
a
beautiful
stately
child
whom
the
people
roared
with
joy
to
see
as
he
rode
through
the
streets
when
he
returned
from
his
journeyings
and
found
him
a
splendid
youth
he
detested
him
when
the
people
began
to
clamor
and
demand
that
he
himself
should
abdicate
he
became
insane
with
rage
and
committed
such
cruelties
that
the
people
ran
mad
themselves
one
day
they
stormed
the
palace
killed
and
overpowered
the
guards
and
rushing
into
the
royal
apartments
burst
in
upon
the
king
as
he
shuddered
green
with
terror
and
fury
in
his
private
room
he
was
king
no
more
and
must
leave
the
country
they
vowed
as
they
closed
round
him
with
bared
weapons
and
shook
them
in
his
face
where
was
the
prince
they
must
see
him
and
tell
him
their
ultimatum
it
was
he
whom
they
wanted
for
a
king
they
trusted
him
and
would
obey
him
they
began
to
shout
aloud
his
name
calling
him
in
a
sort
of
chant
in
unison
prince
ivor
prince
ivor
prince
ivor
but
no
answer
came
the
people
of
the
palace
had
hidden
themselves
and
the
place
was
utterly
silent
the
king
despite
his
terror
could
not
help
but
sneer
call
him
again
he
said
he
is
afraid
to
come
out
of
his
hole
a
savage
fellow
from
the
mountain
fastnesses
struck
him
on
the
mouth
he
afraid
he
shouted
if
he
does
not
come
it
is
because
thou
hast
killed
him
and
thou
art
a
dead
man
this
set
them
aflame
with
hotter
burning
they
broke
away
leaving
three
on
guard
and
ran
about
the
empty
palace
rooms
shouting
the
name
but
there
was
no
answer
they
sought
him
in
a
frenzy
bursting
open
doors
and
flinging
down
every
obstacle
in
their
way
a
page
found
hidden
in
a
closet
owned
that
he
had
seen
his
royal
highness
pass
through
a
corridor
early
in
the
morning
he
had
been
softly
singing
to
himself
one
of
the
shepherd
songs
and
in
this
strange
way
out
of
the
history
of
samavia
five
hundred
years
before
marco
day
the
young
prince
had
walked
singing
softly
to
himself
the
old
song
of
samavia
beauty
and
happiness
for
he
was
never
seen
again
in
every
nook
and
cranny
high
and
low
they
sought
for
him
believing
that
the
king
himself
had
made
him
prisoner
in
some
secret
place
or
had
privately
had
him
killed
the
fury
of
the
people
grew
to
frenzy
there
were
new
risings
and
every
few
days
the
palace
was
attacked
and
searched
again
but
no
trace
of
the
prince
was
found
he
had
vanished
as
a
star
vanishes
when
it
drops
from
its
place
in
the
sky
during
a
riot
in
the
palace
when
a
last
fruitless
search
was
made
the
king
himself
was
killed
a
powerful
noble
who
headed
one
of
the
uprisings
made
himself
king
in
his
place
from
that
time
the
once
splendid
little
kingdom
was
like
a
bone
fought
for
by
dogs
its
pastoral
peace
was
forgotten
it
was
torn
and
worried
and
shaken
by
stronger
countries
it
tore
and
worried
itself
with
internal
fights
it
assassinated
kings
and
created
new
ones
no
man
was
sure
in
his
youth
what
ruler
his
maturity
would
live
under
or
whether
his
children
would
die
in
useless
fights
or
through
stress
of
poverty
and
cruel
useless
laws
there
were
no
more
shepherds
and
herdsmen
who
were
poets
but
on
the
mountain
sides
and
in
the
valleys
sometimes
some
of
the
old
songs
were
sung
those
most
beloved
were
songs
about
a
lost
prince
whose
name
had
been
ivor
if
he
had
been
king
he
would
have
saved
samavia
the
verses
said
and
all
brave
hearts
believed
that
he
would
still
return
in
the
modern
cities
one
of
the
jocular
cynical
sayings
was
yes
that
will
happen
when
prince
ivor
comes
again
in
his
more
childish
days
marco
had
been
bitterly
troubled
by
the
unsolved
mystery
where
had
he
gone
the
lost
prince
had
he
been
killed
or
had
he
been
hidden
away
in
a
dungeon
but
he
was
so
big
and
brave
he
would
have
broken
out
of
any
dungeon
the
boy
had
invented
for
himself
a
dozen
endings
to
the
story
did
no
one
ever
find
his
sword
or
his
cap
or
hear
anything
or
guess
anything
about
him
ever
ever
ever
he
would
say
restlessly
again
and
again
one
winter
night
as
they
sat
together
before
a
small
fire
in
a
cold
room
in
a
cold
city
in
austria
he
had
been
so
eager
and
asked
so
many
searching
questions
that
his
father
gave
him
an
answer
he
had
never
given
him
before
and
which
was
a
sort
of
ending
to
the
story
though
not
a
satisfying
one
everybody
guessed
as
you
are
guessing
a
few
very
old
shepherds
in
the
mountains
who
like
to
believe
ancient
histories
relate
a
story
which
most
people
consider
a
kind
of
legend
it
is
that
almost
a
hundred
years
after
the
prince
was
lost
an
old
shepherd
told
a
story
his
father
had
confided
to
him
in
secret
just
before
he
died
the
father
had
said
that
going
out
in
the
early
morning
on
the
mountain
side
he
had
found
in
the
forest
what
he
at
first
thought
to
be
the
dead
body
of
a
beautiful
boyish
young
huntsman
some
enemy
had
plainly
attacked
him
from
behind
and
believed
he
had
killed
him
he
was
however
not
quite
dead
and
the
shepherd
dragged
him
into
a
cave
where
he
himself
often
took
refuge
from
storms
with
his
flocks
since
there
was
such
riot
and
disorder
in
the
city
he
was
afraid
to
speak
of
what
he
had
found
and
by
the
time
he
discovered
that
he
was
harboring
the
prince
the
king
had
already
been
killed
and
an
even
worse
man
had
taken
possession
of
his
throne
and
ruled
samavia
with
a
iron
hand
to
the
terrified
and
simple
peasant
the
safest
thing
seemed
to
get
the
wounded
youth
out
of
the
country
before
there
was
any
chance
of
his
being
discovered
and
murdered
outright
as
he
would
surely
be
the
cave
in
which
he
was
hidden
was
not
far
from
the
frontier
and
while
he
was
still
so
weak
that
he
was
hardly
conscious
of
what
befell
him
he
was
smuggled
across
it
in
a
cart
loaded
with
sheepskins
and
left
with
some
kind
monks
who
did
not
know
his
rank
or
name
the
shepherd
went
back
to
his
flocks
and
his
mountains
and
lived
and
died
among
them
always
in
terror
of
the
changing
rulers
and
their
savage
battles
with
each
other
the
mountaineers
said
among
themselves
as
the
generations
succeeded
each
other
that
the
lost
prince
must
have
died
young
because
otherwise
he
would
have
come
back
to
his
country
and
tried
to
restore
its
good
bygone
days
yes
he
would
have
come
marco
said
he
would
have
come
if
he
had
seen
that
he
could
help
his
people
loristan
answered
as
if
he
were
not
reflecting
on
a
story
which
was
probably
only
a
kind
of
legend
but
he
was
very
young
and
samavia
was
in
the
hands
of
the
new
dynasty
and
filled
with
his
enemies
he
could
not
have
crossed
the
frontier
without
an
army
still
i
think
he
died
young
illustration
he
was
the
man
who
had
spoken
to
him
in
samavian
it
was
of
this
story
that
marco
was
thinking
as
he
walked
and
perhaps
the
thoughts
that
filled
his
mind
expressed
themselves
in
his
face
in
some
way
which
attracted
attention
as
he
was
nearing
buckingham
palace
a
man
with
clever
eyes
caught
sight
of
him
and
after
looking
at
him
keenly
slackened
his
pace
as
he
approached
him
from
the
opposite
direction
an
observer
might
have
thought
he
saw
something
which
puzzled
and
surprised
him
marco
see
him
at
all
and
still
moved
forward
thinking
of
the
shepherds
and
the
prince
the
man
began
to
walk
still
more
slowly
when
he
was
quite
close
to
marco
he
stopped
and
spoke
to
him
in
the
samavian
language
what
is
your
name
he
asked
marco
training
from
his
earliest
childhood
had
been
an
extraordinary
thing
his
love
for
his
father
had
made
it
simple
and
natural
to
him
and
he
had
never
questioned
the
reason
for
it
as
he
had
been
taught
to
keep
silence
he
had
been
taught
to
control
the
expression
of
his
face
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
above
all
never
to
allow
himself
to
look
startled
but
for
this
he
might
have
started
at
the
extraordinary
sound
of
the
samavian
words
suddenly
uttered
in
a
london
street
by
an
english
gentleman
he
might
even
have
answered
the
question
in
samavian
himself
but
he
did
not
he
courteously
lifted
his
cap
and
replied
in
english
excuse
me
the
gentleman
clever
eyes
scrutinized
him
keenly
then
he
also
spoke
in
english
perhaps
you
do
not
understand
i
asked
your
name
because
you
are
very
like
a
samavian
i
know
he
said
i
am
marco
loristan
the
boy
answered
him
the
man
looked
straight
into
his
eyes
and
smiled
that
is
not
the
name
he
said
i
beg
your
pardon
my
boy
he
was
about
to
go
on
and
had
indeed
taken
a
couple
of
steps
away
when
he
paused
and
turned
to
him
again
you
may
tell
your
father
that
you
are
a
very
lad
i
wanted
to
find
out
for
myself
and
he
went
on
marco
felt
that
his
heart
beat
a
little
quickly
this
was
one
of
several
incidents
which
had
happened
during
the
last
three
years
and
made
him
feel
that
he
was
living
among
things
so
mysterious
that
their
very
mystery
hinted
at
danger
but
he
himself
had
never
before
seemed
involved
in
them
why
should
it
matter
that
he
was
then
he
remembered
something
the
man
had
not
said
he
had
said
in
what
way
he
felt
his
forehead
prickle
slightly
as
he
thought
of
the
smiling
keen
look
which
set
itself
so
straight
upon
him
had
he
spoken
to
him
in
samavian
for
an
experiment
to
see
if
he
would
be
startled
into
forgetting
that
he
had
been
trained
to
seem
to
know
only
the
language
of
the
country
he
was
temporarily
living
in
but
he
had
not
forgotten
he
had
remembered
well
and
was
thankful
that
he
had
betrayed
nothing
even
exiles
may
be
samavian
soldiers
i
am
one
you
must
be
one
his
father
had
said
on
that
day
long
ago
when
he
had
made
him
take
his
oath
perhaps
remembering
his
training
was
being
a
soldier
never
had
samavia
needed
help
as
she
needed
it
two
years
before
a
rival
claimant
to
the
throne
had
assassinated
the
then
reigning
king
and
his
sons
and
since
then
bloody
war
and
tumult
had
raged
the
new
king
was
a
powerful
man
and
had
a
great
following
of
the
worst
and
most
of
the
people
neighboring
countries
had
interfered
for
their
own
welfare
sake
and
the
newspapers
had
been
full
of
stories
of
savage
fighting
and
atrocities
and
of
starving
peasants
marco
had
late
one
evening
entered
their
lodgings
to
find
loristan
walking
to
and
fro
like
a
lion
in
a
cage
a
paper
crushed
and
torn
in
his
hands
and
his
eyes
blazing
he
had
been
reading
of
cruelties
wrought
upon
innocent
peasants
and
women
and
children
lazarus
was
standing
staring
at
him
with
huge
tears
running
down
his
cheeks
when
marco
opened
the
door
the
old
soldier
strode
over
to
him
turned
him
about
and
led
him
out
of
the
room
pardon
sir
pardon
he
sobbed
no
one
must
see
him
not
even
you
he
suffers
so
horribly
he
stood
by
a
chair
in
marco
own
small
bedroom
where
he
half
pushed
half
led
him
he
bent
his
grizzled
head
and
wept
like
a
beaten
child
dear
god
of
those
who
are
in
pain
assuredly
it
is
now
the
time
to
give
back
to
us
our
lost
prince
he
said
and
marco
knew
the
words
were
a
prayer
and
wondered
at
the
frenzied
intensity
of
it
because
it
seemed
so
wild
a
thing
to
pray
for
the
return
of
a
youth
who
had
died
five
hundred
years
before
when
he
reached
the
palace
he
was
still
thinking
of
the
man
who
had
spoken
to
him
he
was
thinking
of
him
even
as
he
looked
at
the
majestic
gray
stone
building
and
counted
the
number
of
its
stories
and
windows
he
walked
round
it
that
he
might
make
a
note
in
his
memory
of
its
size
and
form
and
its
entrances
and
guess
at
the
size
of
its
gardens
this
he
did
because
it
was
part
of
his
game
and
part
of
his
strange
training
when
he
came
back
to
the
front
he
saw
that
in
the
great
entrance
court
within
the
high
iron
railings
an
elegant
but
closed
carriage
was
drawing
up
before
the
doorway
marco
stood
and
watched
with
interest
to
see
who
would
come
out
and
enter
it
he
knew
that
kings
and
emperors
who
were
not
on
parade
looked
merely
like
private
gentlemen
and
often
chose
to
go
out
as
simply
and
quietly
as
other
men
so
he
thought
that
perhaps
if
he
waited
he
might
see
one
of
those
faces
which
represent
the
highest
rank
and
power
in
a
monarchical
country
and
which
in
times
gone
by
had
also
represented
the
power
over
human
life
and
death
and
liberty
i
should
like
to
be
able
to
tell
my
father
that
i
have
seen
the
king
and
know
his
face
as
i
know
the
faces
of
the
czar
and
the
two
emperors
there
was
a
little
movement
among
the
tall
in
the
royal
scarlet
liveries
and
an
elderly
man
descended
the
steps
attended
by
another
who
walked
behind
him
he
entered
the
carriage
the
other
man
followed
him
the
door
was
closed
and
the
carriage
drove
through
the
entrance
gates
where
the
sentries
saluted
marco
was
near
enough
to
see
distinctly
the
two
men
were
talking
as
if
interested
the
face
of
the
one
farthest
from
him
was
the
face
he
had
often
seen
in
and
newspapers
the
boy
made
his
quick
formal
salute
it
was
the
king
and
as
he
smiled
and
acknowledged
his
greeting
he
spoke
to
his
companion
that
fine
lad
salutes
as
if
he
belonged
to
the
army
was
what
he
said
though
marco
could
not
hear
him
his
companion
leaned
forward
to
look
through
the
window
when
he
caught
sight
of
marco
a
singular
expression
crossed
his
face
he
does
belong
to
an
army
sir
he
answered
though
he
does
not
know
it
his
name
is
marco
loristan
then
marco
saw
him
plainly
for
the
first
time
he
was
the
man
with
the
keen
eyes
who
had
spoken
to
him
in
samavian
iv
the
rat
marco
would
have
wondered
very
much
if
he
had
heard
the
words
but
as
he
did
not
hear
them
he
turned
toward
home
wondering
at
something
else
a
man
who
was
in
intimate
attendance
on
a
king
must
be
a
person
of
importance
he
no
doubt
knew
many
things
not
only
of
his
own
country
but
of
the
countries
of
other
kings
but
so
few
had
really
known
anything
of
poor
little
samavia
until
the
newspapers
had
begun
to
tell
them
of
the
horrors
of
its
war
and
who
but
a
samavian
could
speak
its
language
it
would
be
an
interesting
thing
to
tell
his
father
that
a
man
who
knew
the
king
had
spoken
to
him
in
samavian
and
had
sent
that
curious
message
later
he
found
himself
passing
a
side
street
and
looked
up
it
it
was
so
narrow
and
on
either
side
of
it
were
such
old
tall
and
houses
that
it
attracted
his
attention
it
looked
as
if
a
bit
of
old
london
had
been
left
to
stand
while
newer
places
grew
up
and
hid
it
from
view
this
was
the
kind
of
street
he
liked
to
pass
through
for
curiosity
sake
he
knew
many
of
them
in
the
old
quarters
of
many
cities
he
had
lived
in
some
of
them
he
could
find
his
way
home
from
the
other
end
of
it
another
thing
than
its
queerness
attracted
him
he
heard
a
clamor
of
boys
voices
and
he
wanted
to
see
what
they
were
doing
sometimes
when
he
had
reached
a
new
place
and
had
had
that
lonely
feeling
he
had
followed
some
boyish
clamor
of
play
or
wrangling
and
had
found
a
temporary
friend
or
so
to
the
street
end
there
was
an
arched
brick
passage
the
sound
of
the
voices
came
from
there
one
of
them
high
and
thinner
and
shriller
than
the
rest
marco
tramped
up
to
the
arch
and
looked
down
through
the
passage
it
opened
on
to
a
gray
flagged
space
shut
in
by
the
railings
of
a
black
deserted
and
ancient
graveyard
behind
a
venerable
church
which
turned
its
face
toward
some
other
street
the
boys
were
not
playing
but
listening
to
one
of
their
number
who
was
reading
to
them
from
a
newspaper
marco
walked
down
the
passage
and
listened
also
standing
in
the
dark
arched
outlet
at
its
end
and
watching
the
boy
who
read
he
was
a
strange
little
creature
with
a
big
forehead
and
deep
eyes
which
were
curiously
sharp
but
this
was
not
all
he
had
a
hunch
back
his
legs
seemed
small
and
crooked
he
sat
with
them
crossed
before
him
on
a
rough
wooden
platform
set
on
low
wheels
on
which
he
evidently
pushed
himself
about
near
him
were
a
number
of
sticks
stacked
together
as
if
they
were
rifles
one
of
the
first
things
that
marco
noticed
was
that
he
had
a
savage
little
face
marked
with
lines
as
if
he
had
been
angry
all
his
life
hold
your
tongues
you
fools
he
shrilled
out
to
some
boys
who
interrupted
him
do
you
want
to
know
anything
you
ignorant
swine
he
was
as
as
the
rest
of
them
but
he
did
not
speak
in
the
cockney
dialect
if
he
was
of
the
riffraff
of
the
streets
as
his
companions
were
he
was
somehow
different
then
he
by
chance
saw
marco
who
was
standing
in
the
arched
end
of
the
passage
what
are
you
doing
there
listening
he
shouted
and
at
once
stooped
to
pick
up
a
stone
and
threw
it
at
him
the
stone
hit
marco
shoulder
but
it
did
not
hurt
him
much
what
he
did
not
like
was
that
another
lad
should
want
to
throw
something
at
him
before
they
had
even
exchanged
he
also
did
not
like
the
fact
that
two
other
boys
promptly
took
the
matter
up
by
bending
down
to
pick
up
stones
also
he
walked
forward
straight
into
the
group
and
stopped
close
to
the
hunchback
what
did
you
do
that
for
he
asked
in
his
rather
deep
young
voice
he
was
big
and
enough
to
suggest
that
he
was
not
a
boy
it
would
be
easy
to
dispose
of
but
it
was
not
that
which
made
the
group
stand
still
a
moment
to
stare
at
him
it
was
something
in
himself
half
of
it
a
kind
of
impartial
lack
of
anything
like
irritation
at
the
it
was
as
if
it
had
not
mattered
to
him
in
the
least
it
had
not
made
him
feel
angry
or
insulted
he
was
only
rather
curious
about
it
because
he
was
clean
and
his
hair
and
his
shabby
clothes
were
brushed
the
first
impression
given
by
his
appearance
as
he
stood
in
the
archway
was
that
he
was
a
young
toff
poking
his
nose
where
it
was
not
wanted
but
as
he
drew
near
they
saw
that
the
clothes
were
worn
and
there
were
patches
on
his
shoes
what
did
you
do
that
for
he
asked
and
he
asked
it
merely
as
if
he
wanted
to
find
out
the
reason
i
not
going
to
have
you
swells
dropping
in
to
my
club
as
if
it
was
your
own
said
the
hunchback
i
not
a
swell
and
i
did
know
it
was
a
club
marco
answered
i
heard
boys
and
i
thought
i
come
and
look
when
i
heard
you
reading
about
samavia
i
wanted
to
hear
he
looked
at
the
reader
with
his
eyes
you
need
have
thrown
a
stone
he
added
they
do
do
it
at
clubs
i
go
away
he
turned
about
as
if
he
were
going
but
before
he
had
taken
three
steps
the
hunchback
hailed
him
unceremoniously
hi
he
called
out
hi
you
what
do
you
want
said
marco
i
bet
you
do
know
where
samavia
is
or
what
they
fighting
about
the
hunchback
threw
the
words
at
him
yes
i
do
it
north
of
beltrazo
and
east
of
jiardasia
and
they
are
fighting
because
one
party
has
assassinated
king
maran
and
the
other
will
not
let
them
crown
nicola
iarovitch
and
why
should
they
he
a
brigand
and
has
a
drop
of
royal
blood
in
him
oh
reluctantly
admitted
the
hunchback
you
do
know
that
much
do
you
come
back
here
marco
turned
back
while
the
boys
still
stared
it
was
as
if
two
leaders
or
generals
were
meeting
for
the
first
time
and
the
rabble
looking
on
wondered
what
would
come
of
their
encounter
the
samavians
of
the
iarovitch
party
are
a
bad
lot
and
want
only
bad
things
said
marco
speaking
first
they
care
nothing
for
samavia
they
only
care
for
money
and
the
power
to
make
laws
which
will
serve
them
and
crush
everybody
else
they
know
nicola
is
a
weak
man
and
that
if
they
can
crown
him
king
they
can
make
him
do
what
they
like
the
fact
that
he
spoke
first
and
that
though
he
spoke
in
a
steady
boyish
voice
without
swagger
he
somehow
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
that
they
would
listen
made
his
place
for
him
at
once
boys
are
impressionable
creatures
and
they
know
a
leader
when
they
see
him
the
hunchback
fixed
glittering
eyes
on
him
the
rabble
began
to
murmur
rat
rat
several
voices
cried
at
once
in
good
strong
cockney
arst
some
more
rat
is
that
what
they
call
you
marco
asked
the
hunchback
it
what
i
called
myself
he
answered
resentfully
rat
look
at
me
crawling
round
on
the
ground
like
this
look
at
me
he
made
a
gesture
ordering
his
followers
to
move
aside
and
began
to
push
himself
rapidly
with
queer
darts
this
side
and
that
round
the
inclosure
he
bent
his
head
and
body
and
twisted
his
face
and
made
strange
movements
he
even
uttered
sharp
squeaks
as
he
rushed
here
and
there
as
a
rat
might
have
done
when
it
was
being
hunted
he
did
it
as
if
he
were
displaying
an
accomplishment
and
his
followers
laughter
was
applause
was
i
like
a
rat
he
demanded
when
he
suddenly
stopped
you
made
yourself
like
one
on
purpose
marco
answered
you
do
it
for
fun
not
so
much
fun
said
the
rat
i
feel
like
one
every
one
my
enemy
i
vermin
i
ca
fight
or
defend
myself
unless
i
bite
i
can
bite
though
and
he
showed
two
rows
of
fierce
strong
white
teeth
sharper
at
the
points
than
human
teeth
usually
are
i
bite
my
father
when
he
gets
drunk
and
beats
me
i
bitten
him
till
he
learned
to
remember
he
laughed
a
shrill
squeaking
laugh
he
has
tried
it
for
three
months
even
when
he
was
drunk
and
he
always
drunk
then
he
laughed
again
still
more
shrilly
he
a
gentleman
he
said
i
a
gentleman
son
he
was
a
master
at
a
big
school
until
he
was
kicked
out
that
was
when
i
was
four
and
my
mother
died
i
thirteen
now
how
old
are
you
i
twelve
answered
marco
the
rat
twisted
his
face
enviously
i
wish
i
was
your
size
are
you
a
gentleman
son
you
look
as
if
you
were
i
a
very
poor
man
son
was
marco
answer
my
father
is
a
writer
then
ten
to
one
he
a
sort
of
gentleman
said
the
rat
then
quite
suddenly
he
threw
another
question
at
him
what
the
name
of
the
other
samavian
party
the
maranovitch
the
maranovitch
and
the
iarovitch
have
been
fighting
with
each
other
for
five
hundred
years
first
one
dynasty
rules
and
then
the
other
gets
in
when
it
has
killed
somebody
as
it
killed
king
maran
marco
answered
without
hesitation
what
was
the
name
of
the
dynasty
that
ruled
before
they
began
fighting
the
first
maranovitch
assassinated
the
last
of
them
the
rat
asked
him
the
fedorovitch
said
marco
the
last
one
was
a
bad
king
his
son
was
the
one
they
never
found
again
said
the
rat
the
one
they
call
the
lost
prince
marco
would
have
started
but
for
his
long
training
in
exterior
it
was
so
strange
to
hear
his
spoken
of
in
this
back
alley
in
a
slum
and
just
after
he
had
been
thinking
of
him
what
do
you
know
about
him
he
asked
and
as
he
did
so
he
saw
the
group
of
vagabond
lads
draw
nearer
not
much
i
only
read
something
about
him
in
a
torn
magazine
i
found
in
the
street
the
rat
answered
the
man
that
wrote
about
him
said
he
was
only
part
of
a
legend
and
he
laughed
at
people
for
believing
in
him
he
said
it
was
about
time
that
he
should
turn
up
again
if
he
intended
to
i
invented
things
about
him
because
these
chaps
like
to
hear
me
tell
them
they
only
stories
we
likes
a
voice
called
out
becos
wos
the
right
sort
fight
would
if
was
in
samavia
now
marco
rapidly
asked
himself
how
much
he
might
say
he
decided
and
spoke
to
them
all
he
is
not
part
of
a
legend
he
part
of
samavian
history
he
said
i
know
something
about
him
too
how
did
you
find
it
out
asked
the
rat
because
my
father
a
writer
he
obliged
to
have
books
and
papers
and
he
knows
things
i
like
to
read
and
i
go
into
the
free
libraries
you
can
always
get
books
and
papers
there
then
i
ask
my
father
questions
all
the
newspapers
are
full
of
things
about
samavia
just
now
marco
felt
that
this
was
an
explanation
which
betrayed
nothing
it
was
true
that
no
one
could
open
a
newspaper
at
this
period
without
seeing
news
and
stories
of
samavia
the
rat
saw
possible
vistas
of
information
opening
up
before
him
sit
down
here
he
said
and
tell
us
what
you
know
about
him
sit
down
you
fellows
there
was
nothing
to
sit
on
but
the
broken
flagged
pavement
but
that
was
a
small
matter
marco
himself
had
sat
on
flags
or
bare
ground
often
enough
before
and
so
had
the
rest
of
the
lads
he
took
his
place
near
the
rat
and
the
others
made
a
semicircle
in
front
of
them
the
two
leaders
had
joined
forces
so
to
speak
and
the
followers
fell
into
line
at
attention
then
the
began
to
talk
it
was
a
good
story
that
of
the
lost
prince
and
marco
told
it
in
a
way
which
gave
it
reality
how
could
he
help
it
he
knew
as
they
could
not
that
it
was
real
he
who
had
pored
over
maps
of
little
samavia
since
his
seventh
year
who
had
studied
them
with
his
father
knew
it
as
a
country
he
could
have
found
his
way
to
any
part
of
if
he
had
been
dropped
in
any
forest
or
any
mountain
of
it
he
knew
every
highway
and
byway
and
in
the
capital
city
of
melzarr
could
almost
have
made
his
way
blindfolded
he
knew
the
palaces
and
the
forts
the
churches
the
poor
streets
and
the
rich
ones
his
father
had
once
shown
him
a
plan
of
the
royal
palace
which
they
had
studied
together
until
the
boy
knew
each
apartment
and
corridor
in
it
by
heart
but
this
he
did
not
speak
of
he
knew
it
was
one
of
the
things
to
be
silent
about
but
of
the
mountains
and
the
emerald
velvet
meadows
climbing
their
sides
and
only
ending
where
huge
bare
crags
and
peaks
began
he
could
speak
he
could
make
pictures
of
the
wide
fertile
plains
where
herds
of
wild
horses
fed
or
raced
and
sniffed
the
air
he
could
describe
the
fertile
valleys
where
clear
rivers
ran
and
flocks
of
sheep
pastured
on
deep
sweet
grass
he
could
speak
of
them
because
he
could
offer
a
good
enough
reason
for
his
knowledge
of
them
it
was
not
the
only
reason
he
had
for
his
knowledge
but
it
was
one
which
would
serve
well
enough
that
torn
magazine
you
found
had
more
than
one
article
about
samavia
in
it
he
said
to
the
rat
the
same
man
wrote
four
i
read
them
all
in
a
free
library
he
had
been
to
samavia
and
knew
a
great
deal
about
it
he
said
it
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
countries
he
had
ever
traveled
in
and
the
most
fertile
that
what
they
all
say
of
it
the
group
before
him
knew
nothing
of
fertility
or
open
country
they
only
knew
london
back
streets
and
courts
most
of
them
had
never
traveled
as
far
as
the
public
parks
and
in
fact
scarcely
believed
in
their
existence
they
were
a
rough
lot
and
as
they
had
stared
at
marco
at
first
sight
of
him
so
they
continued
to
stare
at
him
as
he
talked
when
he
told
of
the
tall
samavians
who
had
been
like
giants
centuries
ago
and
who
had
hunted
the
wild
horses
and
captured
and
trained
them
to
obedience
by
a
sort
of
strong
and
gentle
magic
their
mouths
fell
open
this
was
the
sort
of
thing
to
allure
any
boy
imagination
blimme
if
i
would
liked
ketchin
one
o
them
broke
in
one
of
the
audience
and
his
exclamation
was
followed
by
a
dozen
of
like
nature
from
the
others
who
would
have
liked
ketchin
one
when
he
told
of
the
deep
forests
and
of
the
herdsmen
and
shepherds
who
played
on
their
pipes
and
made
songs
about
high
deeds
and
bravery
they
grinned
with
pleasure
without
knowing
they
were
grinning
they
did
not
really
know
that
in
this
neglected
inclosure
shut
in
on
one
side
by
houses
and
on
the
other
by
a
deserted
and
forgotten
sunken
graveyard
they
heard
the
rustle
of
green
forest
boughs
where
birds
nested
close
the
swish
of
the
summer
wind
in
the
river
reeds
and
the
tinkle
and
laughter
and
rush
of
brooks
running
they
heard
more
or
less
of
it
all
through
the
lost
prince
story
because
prince
ivor
had
loved
lowland
woods
and
mountain
forests
and
all
life
when
marco
pictured
him
tall
and
and
young
winning
all
the
people
when
he
rode
smiling
among
them
the
boys
grinned
again
with
unconscious
pleasure
wisht
got
lost
some
one
cried
out
when
they
heard
of
the
unrest
and
dissatisfaction
of
the
samavians
they
began
to
get
restless
themselves
when
marco
reached
the
part
of
the
story
in
which
the
mob
rushed
into
the
palace
and
demanded
their
prince
from
the
king
they
ejaculated
scraps
of
bad
language
the
old
geezer
had
got
him
hidden
somewhere
in
some
dungeon
or
he
killed
him
out
out
that
what
he
been
up
to
they
clamored
wisht
the
lot
of
us
had
been
there
then
wisht
we
we
give
wot
for
anyway
an
walkin
out
o
the
place
so
early
in
the
mornin
just
like
that
follered
an
done
for
they
decided
with
various
exclamations
of
boyish
wrath
somehow
the
fact
that
the
handsome
royal
lad
had
strolled
into
the
morning
sunshine
singing
made
them
more
savage
their
language
was
extremely
bad
at
this
point
but
if
it
was
bad
here
it
became
worse
when
the
old
shepherd
found
the
young
huntsman
body
in
the
forest
he
bin
for
the
bin
give
no
charnst
they
groaned
in
chorus
wisht
bin
there
when
bin
done
fur
somebody
themselves
it
was
a
story
which
had
a
queer
effect
on
them
it
made
them
think
they
saw
things
it
fired
their
blood
it
set
them
wanting
to
fight
for
ideals
they
knew
nothing
about
adventurous
things
for
instance
and
high
and
noble
young
princes
who
were
full
of
the
possibility
of
great
and
good
deeds
sitting
upon
the
broken
flagstones
of
the
bit
of
ground
behind
the
deserted
graveyard
they
were
suddenly
dragged
into
the
world
of
romance
and
noble
young
princes
and
great
and
good
deeds
became
as
real
as
the
sunken
gravestones
and
far
more
interesting
and
then
the
smuggling
across
the
frontier
of
the
unconscious
prince
in
the
bullock
cart
loaded
with
sheepskins
they
held
their
breaths
would
the
old
shepherd
get
him
past
the
line
marco
who
was
lost
in
the
recital
himself
told
it
as
if
he
had
been
present
he
felt
as
if
he
had
and
as
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
told
it
to
thrilled
listeners
his
imagination
got
him
in
its
grip
and
his
heart
jumped
in
his
breast
as
he
was
sure
the
old
man
must
have
done
when
the
guard
stopped
his
cart
and
asked
him
what
he
was
carrying
out
of
the
country
he
knew
he
must
have
had
to
call
up
all
his
strength
to
force
his
voice
into
steadiness
and
then
the
good
monks
he
had
to
stop
to
explain
what
a
monk
was
and
when
he
described
the
solitude
of
the
ancient
monastery
and
its
walled
gardens
full
of
flowers
and
old
simples
to
be
used
for
healing
and
the
wise
monks
walking
in
the
silence
and
the
sun
the
boys
stared
a
little
helplessly
but
still
as
if
they
were
vaguely
pleased
by
the
picture
and
then
there
was
no
more
to
tell
no
more
there
it
broke
off
and
something
like
a
low
howl
of
dismay
broke
from
the
semicircle
aw
they
protested
it
ought
to
stop
there
ai
there
no
more
is
that
all
there
is
it
all
that
was
ever
known
really
and
that
last
part
might
only
be
a
sort
of
story
made
up
by
somebody
but
i
believe
it
myself
the
rat
had
listened
with
burning
eyes
he
had
sat
biting
his
as
was
a
trick
of
his
when
he
was
excited
or
angry
tell
you
what
he
exclaimed
suddenly
this
was
what
happened
it
was
some
of
the
maranovitch
fellows
that
tried
to
kill
him
they
meant
to
kill
his
father
and
make
their
own
man
king
and
they
knew
the
people
would
stand
it
if
young
ivor
was
alive
they
just
stabbed
him
in
the
back
the
fiends
i
dare
say
they
heard
the
old
shepherd
coming
and
left
him
for
dead
and
ran
right
oh
that
was
it
the
lads
agreed
yer
right
there
rat
when
he
got
well
the
rat
went
on
feverishly
still
biting
his
nails
he
could
go
back
he
was
only
a
boy
the
other
fellow
had
been
crowned
and
his
followers
felt
strong
because
they
just
conquered
the
country
he
could
have
done
nothing
without
an
army
and
he
was
too
young
to
raise
one
perhaps
he
thought
he
wait
till
he
was
old
enough
to
know
what
to
do
i
dare
say
he
went
away
and
had
to
work
for
his
living
as
if
he
never
been
a
prince
at
all
then
perhaps
sometime
he
married
somebody
and
had
a
son
and
told
him
as
a
secret
who
he
was
and
all
about
samavia
the
rat
began
to
look
vengeful
if
i
bin
him
have
told
him
not
to
forget
what
the
maranovitch
had
done
to
me
have
told
him
that
if
i
could
get
back
the
throne
he
must
see
what
he
could
do
when
he
grew
to
be
a
man
and
i
have
made
him
swear
if
he
got
it
back
to
take
it
out
of
them
or
their
children
or
their
children
children
in
torture
and
killing
i
have
made
him
swear
not
to
leave
a
maranovitch
alive
and
i
have
told
him
that
if
he
do
it
in
his
life
he
must
pass
the
oath
on
to
his
son
and
his
son
as
long
as
there
was
a
fedorovitch
on
earth
would
you
he
demanded
hotly
of
marco
marco
blood
was
also
hot
but
it
was
a
different
kind
of
blood
and
he
had
talked
too
much
to
a
very
sane
man
no
he
said
slowly
what
would
have
been
the
use
it
would
have
done
samavia
any
good
and
it
would
have
done
him
any
good
to
torture
and
kill
people
better
keep
them
alive
and
make
them
do
things
for
the
country
if
you
a
patriot
you
think
of
the
country
he
wanted
to
add
that
what
my
father
says
but
he
did
not
torture
first
and
then
attend
to
the
country
snapped
the
rat
what
would
you
have
told
your
son
if
you
been
ivor
i
have
told
him
to
learn
everything
about
samavia
and
all
the
things
kings
have
to
know
and
study
things
about
laws
and
other
countries
and
about
keeping
silent
and
about
governing
himself
as
if
he
were
a
general
commanding
soldiers
in
battle
so
that
he
would
never
do
anything
he
did
not
mean
to
do
or
could
be
ashamed
of
doing
after
it
was
over
and
i
have
asked
him
to
tell
his
son
sons
to
tell
their
sons
to
learn
the
same
things
so
you
see
however
long
the
time
was
there
would
always
be
a
king
getting
ready
for
samavia
when
samavia
really
wanted
him
and
he
would
be
a
real
king
he
stopped
himself
suddenly
and
looked
at
the
staring
semicircle
i
did
make
that
up
myself
he
said
i
have
heard
a
man
who
reads
and
knows
things
say
it
i
believe
the
lost
prince
would
have
had
the
same
thoughts
if
he
had
and
told
them
to
his
son
there
has
been
a
line
of
kings
in
training
for
samavia
for
five
hundred
years
and
perhaps
one
is
walking
about
the
streets
of
vienna
or
budapest
or
paris
or
london
now
and
he
be
ready
if
the
people
found
out
about
him
and
called
him
wisht
they
would
some
one
yelled
it
would
be
a
queer
secret
to
know
all
the
time
when
no
one
else
knew
it
the
rat
communed
with
himself
as
it
were
that
you
were
a
king
and
you
ought
to
be
on
a
throne
wearing
a
crown
i
wonder
if
it
would
make
a
chap
look
different
he
laughed
his
squeaky
laugh
and
then
turned
in
his
sudden
way
to
marco
but
he
be
a
fool
to
give
up
the
vengeance
what
is
your
name
marco
loristan
what
yours
it
is
the
rat
really
it
jem
that
pretty
near
where
do
you
live
no
philibert
place
this
club
is
a
soldiers
club
said
the
rat
it
called
the
squad
i
the
captain
you
fellows
let
show
him
the
semicircle
sprang
to
its
feet
there
were
about
twelve
lads
altogether
and
when
they
stood
upright
marco
saw
at
once
that
for
some
reason
they
were
accustomed
to
obeying
the
word
of
command
with
military
precision
form
in
line
ordered
the
rat
they
did
it
at
once
and
held
their
backs
and
legs
straight
and
their
heads
up
amazingly
well
each
had
seized
one
of
the
sticks
which
had
been
stacked
together
like
guns
the
rat
himself
sat
up
straight
on
his
platform
there
was
actually
something
military
in
the
bearing
of
his
lean
body
his
voice
lost
its
squeak
and
its
sharpness
became
commanding
he
put
the
dozen
lads
through
the
drill
as
if
he
had
been
a
smart
young
officer
and
the
drill
itself
was
prompt
and
smart
enough
to
have
done
credit
to
practiced
soldiers
in
barracks
it
made
marco
involuntarily
stand
very
straight
himself
and
watch
with
surprised
interest
that
good
he
exclaimed
when
it
was
at
an
end
how
did
you
learn
that
the
rat
made
a
savage
gesture
if
i
had
legs
to
stand
on
i
have
been
a
soldier
he
said
have
enlisted
in
any
regiment
that
would
take
me
i
do
care
for
anything
else
suddenly
his
face
changed
and
he
shouted
a
command
to
his
followers
turn
your
backs
he
ordered
and
they
did
turn
their
backs
and
looked
through
the
railings
of
the
old
churchyard
marco
saw
that
they
were
obeying
an
order
which
was
not
new
to
them
the
rat
had
thrown
his
arm
up
over
his
eyes
and
covered
them
he
held
it
there
for
several
moments
as
if
he
did
not
want
to
be
seen
marco
turned
his
back
as
the
rest
had
done
all
at
once
he
understood
that
though
the
rat
was
not
crying
yet
he
was
feeling
something
which
another
boy
would
possibly
have
broken
down
under
all
right
he
shouted
presently
and
dropped
his
arm
and
sat
up
straight
again
i
want
to
go
to
war
he
said
hoarsely
i
want
to
fight
i
want
to
lead
a
lot
of
men
into
battle
and
i
have
got
any
legs
sometimes
it
takes
the
pluck
out
of
me
you
not
grown
up
yet
said
marco
you
might
get
strong
no
one
knows
what
is
going
to
happen
how
did
you
learn
to
drill
the
club
i
hang
about
barracks
i
watch
and
listen
i
follow
soldiers
if
i
could
get
books
i
read
about
wars
i
ca
go
to
libraries
as
you
can
i
can
do
nothing
but
scuffle
about
like
a
rat
i
can
take
you
to
some
libraries
said
marco
there
are
places
where
boys
can
get
in
and
i
can
get
some
papers
from
my
father
can
you
said
the
rat
do
you
want
to
join
the
club
yes
marco
answered
i
speak
to
my
father
about
it
he
said
it
because
the
hungry
longing
for
companionship
in
his
own
mind
had
found
a
sort
of
response
in
the
queer
hungry
look
in
the
rat
eyes
he
wanted
to
see
him
again
strange
creature
as
he
was
there
was
attraction
in
him
scuffling
about
on
his
low
wheeled
platform
he
had
drawn
this
group
of
rough
lads
to
him
and
made
himself
their
commander
they
obeyed
him
they
listened
to
his
stories
and
harangues
about
war
and
soldiering
they
let
him
drill
them
and
give
them
orders
marco
knew
that
when
he
told
his
father
about
him
he
would
be
interested
the
boy
wanted
to
hear
what
loristan
would
say
i
going
home
now
he
said
if
you
going
to
be
here
i
will
try
to
come
we
shall
be
here
the
rat
answered
it
our
barracks
marco
drew
himself
up
smartly
and
made
his
salute
as
if
to
a
superior
officer
then
he
wheeled
about
and
marched
through
the
brick
archway
and
the
sound
of
his
boyish
tread
was
as
regular
and
decided
as
if
he
had
been
a
man
keeping
time
with
his
regiment
he
been
drilled
himself
said
the
rat
he
knows
as
much
as
i
do
and
he
sat
up
and
stared
down
the
passage
with
new
interest
v
silence
is
still
the
order
they
were
even
poorer
than
usual
just
now
and
the
supper
marco
and
his
father
sat
down
to
was
scant
enough
lazarus
stood
upright
behind
his
master
chair
and
served
him
with
strictest
ceremony
their
poor
lodgings
were
always
kept
with
a
soldierly
cleanliness
and
order
when
an
object
could
be
polished
it
was
forced
to
shine
no
grain
of
dust
was
allowed
to
lie
undisturbed
and
this
perfection
was
not
attained
through
the
ministrations
of
a
lodging
house
slavey
lazarus
made
himself
extremely
popular
by
taking
the
work
of
caring
for
his
master
rooms
entirely
out
of
the
hands
of
the
overburdened
maids
of
all
work
he
had
learned
to
do
many
things
in
his
young
days
in
barracks
he
carried
about
with
him
coarse
bits
of
and
towels
which
he
laundered
as
if
they
had
been
the
finest
linen
he
mended
he
patched
he
darned
and
in
the
hardest
fight
the
poor
must
face
the
fight
with
dirt
and
dinginess
he
always
held
his
own
they
had
nothing
but
dry
bread
and
coffee
this
evening
but
lazarus
had
made
the
coffee
and
the
bread
was
good
as
marco
ate
he
told
his
father
the
story
of
the
rat
and
his
followers
loristan
listened
as
the
boy
had
known
he
would
with
the
smile
in
his
dark
eyes
it
was
a
look
which
always
fascinated
marco
because
it
meant
that
he
was
thinking
so
many
things
perhaps
he
would
tell
some
of
them
and
perhaps
he
would
not
his
spell
over
the
boy
lay
in
the
fact
that
to
him
he
seemed
like
a
wonderful
book
of
which
one
had
only
glimpses
it
was
full
of
pictures
and
adventures
which
were
true
and
one
could
not
help
continually
making
guesses
about
them
yes
the
feeling
that
marco
had
was
that
his
father
attraction
for
him
was
a
sort
of
spell
and
that
others
felt
the
same
thing
when
he
stood
and
talked
to
commoner
people
he
held
his
tall
body
with
singular
quiet
grace
which
was
like
power
he
never
stirred
or
moved
himself
as
if
he
were
nervous
or
uncertain
he
could
hold
his
hands
he
had
beautiful
slender
and
strong
hands
quite
still
he
could
stand
on
his
fine
arched
feet
without
shuffling
them
he
could
sit
without
any
ungrace
or
restlessness
his
mind
knew
what
his
body
should
do
and
gave
it
orders
without
speaking
and
his
fine
limbs
and
muscles
and
nerves
obeyed
so
he
could
stand
still
and
at
ease
and
look
at
the
people
he
was
talking
to
and
they
always
looked
at
him
and
listened
to
what
he
said
and
somehow
courteous
and
uncondescending
as
his
manner
unfailingly
was
it
used
always
to
seem
to
marco
as
if
he
were
giving
an
audience
as
kings
gave
them
he
had
often
seen
people
bow
very
low
when
they
went
away
from
him
and
more
than
once
it
had
happened
that
some
humble
person
had
stepped
out
of
his
presence
backward
as
people
do
when
retiring
before
a
sovereign
and
yet
his
bearing
was
the
quietest
and
least
assuming
in
the
world
and
they
were
talking
about
samavia
and
he
knew
the
story
of
the
lost
prince
he
said
ponderingly
even
in
that
place
he
wants
to
hear
about
wars
he
wants
to
talk
about
them
marco
answered
if
he
could
stand
and
were
old
enough
he
would
go
and
fight
for
samavia
himself
it
is
a
and
sad
place
now
said
loristan
the
people
are
mad
when
they
are
not
heartbroken
and
terrified
suddenly
marco
struck
the
table
with
a
sounding
slap
of
his
boy
hand
he
did
it
before
he
realized
any
intention
in
his
own
mind
why
should
either
one
of
the
iarovitch
or
one
of
the
maranovitch
be
king
he
cried
they
were
only
savage
peasants
when
they
first
fought
for
the
crown
hundreds
of
years
ago
the
most
savage
one
got
it
and
they
have
been
fighting
ever
since
only
the
fedorovitch
were
born
kings
there
is
only
one
man
in
the
world
who
has
the
right
to
the
throne
and
i
do
know
whether
he
is
in
the
world
or
not
but
i
believe
he
is
i
do
loristan
looked
at
his
hot
face
with
a
reflective
curiousness
he
saw
that
the
flame
which
had
leaped
up
in
him
had
leaped
without
warning
just
as
a
fierce
might
have
shaken
him
you
mean
he
suggested
softly
ivor
fedorovitch
king
ivor
he
ought
to
be
and
the
people
would
obey
him
and
the
good
days
would
come
again
it
is
five
hundred
years
since
ivor
fedorovitch
left
the
good
monks
loristan
still
spoke
softly
but
father
marco
protested
even
the
rat
said
what
you
said
that
he
was
too
young
to
be
able
to
come
back
while
the
maranovitch
were
in
power
and
he
would
have
to
work
and
have
a
home
and
perhaps
he
is
as
poor
as
we
are
but
when
he
had
a
son
he
would
call
him
ivor
and
him
and
his
son
would
call
son
ivor
and
tell
and
it
would
go
on
and
on
they
could
never
call
their
eldest
sons
anything
but
ivor
and
what
you
said
about
the
training
would
be
true
there
would
always
be
a
king
being
trained
for
samavia
and
ready
to
be
called
in
the
fire
of
his
feelings
he
sprang
from
his
chair
and
stood
upright
why
there
may
be
a
king
of
samavia
in
some
city
now
who
knows
he
is
king
and
when
he
reads
about
the
fighting
among
his
people
his
blood
gets
they
his
own
people
his
very
own
he
ought
to
go
to
them
he
ought
to
go
and
tell
them
who
he
is
do
you
think
he
ought
father
it
would
not
be
as
easy
as
it
seems
to
a
boy
loristan
answered
there
are
many
countries
which
would
have
something
to
say
russia
would
have
her
word
and
austria
and
germany
and
england
never
is
silent
but
if
he
were
a
strong
man
and
knew
how
to
make
strong
friends
in
silence
he
might
sometime
be
able
to
declare
himself
openly
but
if
he
is
anywhere
some
one
some
samavian
ought
to
go
and
look
for
him
it
ought
to
be
a
samavian
who
is
very
clever
and
a
patriot
he
stopped
at
a
flash
of
recognition
father
he
cried
out
father
you
you
are
the
one
who
could
find
him
if
any
one
in
the
world
could
but
perhaps
and
he
stopped
a
moment
again
because
new
thoughts
rushed
through
his
mind
have
ever
looked
for
him
he
asked
hesitating
perhaps
he
had
asked
a
stupid
question
perhaps
his
father
had
always
been
looking
for
him
perhaps
that
was
his
secret
and
his
work
but
loristan
did
not
look
as
if
he
thought
him
stupid
quite
the
contrary
he
kept
his
handsome
eyes
fixed
on
him
still
in
that
curious
way
as
if
he
were
studying
him
as
if
he
were
much
more
than
twelve
years
old
and
he
were
deciding
to
tell
him
something
comrade
at
arms
he
said
with
the
smile
which
always
gladdened
marco
heart
you
have
kept
your
oath
of
allegiance
like
a
man
you
were
not
seven
years
old
when
you
took
it
you
are
growing
older
silence
is
still
the
order
but
you
are
man
enough
to
be
told
more
he
paused
and
looked
down
and
then
looked
up
again
speaking
in
a
low
tone
i
have
not
looked
for
him
he
said
because
i
believe
i
know
where
he
is
marco
caught
his
breath
father
he
said
only
that
word
he
could
say
no
more
he
knew
he
must
not
ask
questions
silence
is
still
the
order
but
as
they
faced
each
other
in
their
dingy
room
at
the
back
of
the
shabby
house
on
the
side
of
the
roaring
common
road
as
lazarus
stood
behind
his
father
chair
and
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
empty
coffee
cups
and
the
dry
bread
plate
and
everything
looked
as
poor
as
things
always
did
there
was
a
king
of
samavia
an
ivor
fedorovitch
with
the
blood
of
the
lost
prince
in
his
veins
alive
in
some
town
or
city
this
moment
and
marco
own
father
knew
where
he
was
he
glanced
at
lazarus
but
though
the
old
soldier
face
looked
as
expressionless
as
if
it
were
cut
out
of
wood
marco
realized
that
he
knew
this
thing
and
had
always
known
it
he
had
been
a
comrade
at
arms
all
his
life
he
continued
to
stare
at
the
bread
plate
loristan
spoke
again
and
in
an
even
lower
voice
the
samavians
who
are
patriots
and
thinkers
he
said
formed
themselves
into
a
secret
party
about
eighty
years
ago
they
formed
it
when
they
had
no
reason
for
hope
but
they
formed
it
because
one
of
them
discovered
that
an
ivor
fedorovitch
was
living
he
was
head
forester
on
a
great
estate
in
the
austrian
alps
the
nobleman
he
served
had
always
thought
him
a
mystery
because
he
had
the
bearing
and
speech
of
a
man
who
had
not
been
born
a
servant
and
his
methods
in
caring
for
the
forests
and
game
were
those
of
a
man
who
was
educated
and
had
studied
his
subject
but
he
never
was
familiar
or
assuming
and
never
professed
superiority
over
any
of
his
fellows
he
was
a
man
of
great
stature
and
was
extraordinarily
brave
and
silent
the
nobleman
who
was
his
master
made
a
sort
of
companion
of
him
when
they
hunted
together
once
he
took
him
with
him
when
he
traveled
to
samavia
to
hunt
wild
horses
he
found
that
he
knew
the
country
strangely
well
and
that
he
was
familiar
with
samavian
hunting
and
customs
before
he
returned
to
austria
the
man
obtained
permission
to
go
to
the
mountains
alone
he
went
among
the
shepherds
and
made
friends
among
them
asking
many
questions
one
night
around
a
forest
fire
he
heard
the
songs
about
the
lost
prince
which
had
not
been
forgotten
even
after
nearly
five
hundred
years
had
passed
the
shepherds
and
herdsmen
talked
about
prince
ivor
and
told
old
stories
about
him
and
related
the
prophecy
that
he
would
come
back
and
bring
again
samavia
good
days
he
might
come
only
in
the
body
of
one
of
his
descendants
but
it
would
be
his
spirit
which
came
because
his
spirit
would
never
cease
to
love
samavia
one
very
old
shepherd
tottered
to
his
feet
and
lifted
his
face
to
the
myriad
stars
bestrewn
like
jewels
in
the
blue
sky
above
the
forest
trees
and
he
wept
and
prayed
aloud
that
the
great
god
would
send
their
king
to
them
and
the
stranger
huntsman
stood
upright
also
and
lifted
his
face
to
the
stars
and
though
he
said
no
word
the
herdsman
nearest
to
him
saw
tears
on
his
cheeks
great
heavy
tears
the
next
day
the
stranger
went
to
the
monastery
where
the
order
of
good
monks
lived
who
had
taken
care
of
the
lost
prince
when
he
had
left
samavia
the
secret
society
was
formed
and
the
members
of
it
knew
that
an
ivor
fedorovitch
had
passed
through
his
ancestors
country
as
the
servant
of
another
man
but
the
secret
society
was
only
a
small
one
and
though
it
has
been
growing
ever
since
and
it
has
done
good
deeds
and
good
work
in
secret
the
huntsman
died
an
old
man
before
it
was
strong
enough
even
to
dare
to
tell
samavia
what
it
knew
had
he
a
son
cried
marco
had
he
a
son
yes
he
had
a
son
his
name
was
ivor
and
he
was
trained
as
i
told
you
that
part
i
knew
to
be
true
though
i
should
have
believed
it
was
true
even
if
i
had
not
known
there
has
been
a
king
ready
for
samavia
even
when
he
has
labored
with
his
hands
and
served
others
each
one
took
the
oath
of
allegiance
as
i
did
said
marco
breathless
with
excitement
when
one
is
twelve
years
old
to
be
so
near
a
lost
prince
who
might
end
wars
is
a
thrilling
thing
the
same
answered
loristan
marco
threw
up
his
hand
in
salute
grows
a
man
for
samavia
god
be
thanked
he
quoted
and
is
somewhere
and
you
know
loristan
bent
his
head
in
acquiescence
for
years
much
secret
work
has
been
done
and
the
fedorovitch
party
has
grown
until
it
is
much
greater
and
more
powerful
than
the
other
parties
dream
the
larger
countries
are
tired
of
the
constant
war
and
disorder
in
samavia
their
interests
are
disturbed
by
them
and
they
are
deciding
that
they
must
have
peace
and
laws
which
can
be
counted
on
there
have
been
samavian
patriots
who
have
spent
their
lives
in
trying
to
bring
this
about
by
making
friends
in
the
most
powerful
capitals
and
working
secretly
for
the
future
good
of
their
own
land
because
samavia
is
so
small
and
uninfluential
it
has
taken
a
long
time
but
when
king
maran
and
his
family
were
assassinated
and
the
war
broke
out
there
were
great
powers
which
began
to
say
that
if
some
king
of
good
blood
and
reliable
characteristics
were
given
the
crown
he
should
be
upheld
blood
marco
intensity
made
his
voice
drop
almost
to
a
whisper
blood
has
been
trained
for
five
hundred
years
father
if
it
comes
true
though
he
laughed
a
little
he
was
obliged
to
wink
his
eyes
hard
because
suddenly
he
felt
tears
rush
into
them
which
no
boy
likes
the
shepherds
will
have
to
make
a
new
song
it
will
have
to
be
a
shouting
one
about
a
prince
going
away
and
a
king
coming
back
they
are
a
devout
people
and
observe
many
an
ancient
rite
and
ceremony
they
will
chant
prayers
and
burn
on
their
mountain
sides
loristan
said
but
the
end
is
not
yet
the
end
is
not
yet
sometimes
it
seems
that
perhaps
it
is
near
but
god
knows
then
there
leaped
back
upon
marco
the
story
he
had
to
tell
but
which
he
had
held
back
for
the
last
the
story
of
the
man
who
spoke
samavian
and
drove
in
the
carriage
with
the
king
he
knew
now
that
it
might
mean
some
important
thing
which
he
could
not
have
before
suspected
there
is
something
i
must
tell
you
he
said
he
had
learned
to
relate
incidents
in
few
but
clear
words
when
he
related
them
to
his
father
it
had
been
part
of
his
training
loristan
had
said
that
he
might
sometime
have
a
story
to
tell
when
he
had
but
few
moments
to
tell
it
in
some
story
which
meant
life
or
death
to
some
one
he
told
this
one
quickly
and
well
he
made
loristan
see
the
man
with
the
deliberate
manner
and
the
keen
eyes
and
he
made
him
hear
his
voice
when
he
said
tell
your
father
that
you
are
a
very
lad
i
am
glad
he
said
that
he
is
a
man
who
knows
what
training
is
said
loristan
he
is
a
person
who
knows
what
all
europe
is
doing
and
almost
all
that
it
will
do
he
is
an
ambassador
from
a
powerful
and
great
country
if
he
saw
that
you
are
a
and
fine
lad
it
might
it
might
even
be
good
for
samavia
would
it
matter
that
was
it
matter
to
samavia
marco
cried
out
loristan
paused
for
a
moment
watching
him
gravely
looking
him
over
his
big
boy
frame
his
shabby
clothes
and
his
eagerly
burning
eyes
he
smiled
one
of
his
slow
wonderful
smiles
yes
it
might
even
matter
to
samavia
he
answered
vi
the
drill
and
the
secret
party
loristan
did
not
forbid
marco
to
pursue
his
acquaintance
with
the
rat
and
his
followers
you
will
find
out
for
yourself
whether
they
are
friends
for
you
or
not
he
said
you
will
know
in
a
few
days
and
then
you
can
make
your
own
decision
you
have
known
lads
in
various
countries
and
you
are
a
good
judge
of
them
i
think
you
will
soon
see
whether
they
are
going
to
be
or
mere
rabble
the
rat
now
how
does
he
strike
you
and
the
handsome
eyes
held
their
keen
look
of
questioning
he
be
a
brave
soldier
if
he
could
stand
said
marco
thinking
him
over
but
he
might
be
cruel
a
lad
who
might
make
a
brave
soldier
can
not
be
disdained
but
a
man
who
is
cruel
is
a
fool
tell
him
that
from
me
loristan
answered
he
wastes
force
his
own
and
the
force
of
the
one
he
treats
cruelly
only
a
fool
wastes
force
may
i
speak
of
you
sometimes
asked
marco
yes
you
will
know
how
you
will
remember
the
things
about
which
silence
is
the
order
i
never
forget
them
said
marco
i
have
been
trying
not
to
for
such
a
long
time
you
have
succeeded
well
comrade
returned
loristan
from
his
to
which
he
had
gone
and
where
he
was
turning
over
papers
a
strong
impulse
overpowered
the
boy
he
marched
over
to
the
table
and
stood
very
straight
making
his
soldierly
young
salute
his
whole
body
glowing
father
he
said
you
do
know
how
i
love
you
i
wish
you
were
a
general
and
i
might
die
in
battle
for
you
when
i
look
at
you
i
long
and
long
to
do
something
for
you
a
boy
could
not
do
i
would
die
of
a
thousand
wounds
rather
than
disobey
you
or
samavia
he
seized
loristan
hand
and
knelt
on
one
knee
and
kissed
it
an
english
or
american
boy
could
not
have
done
such
a
thing
from
unaffected
natural
impulse
but
he
was
of
warm
southern
blood
i
took
my
oath
of
allegiance
to
you
father
when
i
took
it
to
samavia
it
seems
as
if
you
were
samavia
too
he
said
and
kissed
his
hand
again
loristan
had
turned
toward
him
with
one
of
the
movements
which
were
full
of
dignity
and
grace
marco
looking
up
at
him
felt
that
there
was
always
a
certain
remote
stateliness
in
him
which
made
it
seem
quite
natural
that
any
one
should
bend
the
knee
and
kiss
his
hand
a
sudden
great
tenderness
glowed
in
his
father
face
as
he
raised
the
boy
and
put
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
comrade
he
said
you
do
know
how
much
i
love
you
and
what
reason
there
is
that
we
should
love
each
other
you
do
know
how
i
have
been
watching
you
and
thanking
god
each
year
that
here
grew
a
man
for
samavia
that
i
know
you
are
a
though
you
have
lived
but
twelve
years
twelve
years
may
grow
a
man
or
prove
that
a
man
will
never
grow
though
a
human
thing
he
may
remain
for
ninety
years
this
year
may
be
full
of
strange
things
for
both
of
us
we
can
not
know
i
may
have
to
ask
you
to
do
for
me
and
for
samavia
perhaps
such
a
thing
as
no
boy
has
ever
done
before
every
night
and
every
morning
said
marco
i
shall
pray
that
i
may
be
called
to
do
it
and
that
i
may
do
it
well
you
will
do
it
well
comrade
if
you
are
called
that
i
could
make
oath
loristan
answered
him
the
squad
had
collected
in
the
inclosure
behind
the
church
when
marco
appeared
at
the
arched
end
of
the
passage
the
boys
were
drawn
up
with
their
rifles
but
they
all
wore
a
rather
dogged
and
sullen
look
the
explanation
which
darted
into
marco
mind
was
that
this
was
because
the
rat
was
in
a
bad
humor
he
sat
crouched
together
on
his
platform
biting
his
nails
fiercely
his
elbows
on
his
updrawn
knees
his
face
twisted
into
a
hideous
scowl
he
did
not
look
around
or
even
look
up
from
the
cracked
flagstone
of
the
pavement
on
which
his
eyes
were
fixed
marco
went
forward
with
military
step
and
stopped
opposite
to
him
with
prompt
salute
sorry
to
be
late
sir
he
said
as
if
he
had
been
a
private
speaking
to
his
colonel
it
rat
come
rat
the
squad
shouted
look
at
but
the
rat
would
not
look
and
did
not
even
move
what
the
matter
said
marco
with
less
ceremony
than
a
private
would
have
shown
there
no
use
in
my
coming
here
if
you
do
want
me
got
a
grouch
on
you
late
called
out
the
head
of
the
line
no
doin
nothin
when
got
a
grouch
on
i
try
to
do
anything
said
marco
his
setting
itself
into
good
stubborn
lines
that
not
what
i
came
here
for
i
came
to
drill
i
been
with
my
father
he
comes
first
i
ca
join
the
squad
if
he
does
come
first
we
not
on
active
service
and
we
not
in
barracks
then
the
rat
moved
sharply
and
turned
to
look
at
him
i
thought
you
were
coming
at
all
he
snapped
and
growled
at
once
my
father
said
you
would
he
said
you
were
a
young
swell
for
all
your
patched
clothes
he
said
your
father
would
think
he
was
a
swell
even
if
he
was
only
a
on
newspapers
and
he
would
let
you
have
anything
to
do
with
a
vagabond
and
a
nuisance
nobody
begged
you
to
join
your
father
can
go
to
blazes
do
you
speak
in
that
way
about
my
father
said
marco
quite
quietly
because
i
ca
knock
you
down
i
get
up
and
let
you
began
the
rat
immediately
white
and
raging
i
can
stand
up
with
two
sticks
i
get
up
and
let
you
no
you
wo
said
marco
if
you
want
to
know
what
my
father
said
i
can
tell
you
he
said
i
could
come
as
often
as
i
liked
till
i
found
out
whether
we
should
be
friends
or
not
he
says
i
shall
find
that
out
for
myself
it
was
a
strange
thing
the
rat
did
it
must
always
be
remembered
of
him
that
his
wretched
father
who
had
each
year
sunk
lower
and
lower
in
the
had
been
a
gentleman
once
a
man
who
had
been
familiar
with
good
manners
and
had
been
educated
in
the
customs
of
good
breeding
sometimes
when
he
was
drunk
and
sometimes
when
he
was
partly
sober
he
talked
to
the
rat
of
many
things
the
boy
would
otherwise
never
have
heard
of
that
was
why
the
lad
was
different
from
the
other
vagabonds
this
also
was
why
he
suddenly
altered
the
whole
situation
by
doing
this
strange
and
unexpected
thing
he
utterly
changed
his
expression
and
voice
fixing
his
sharp
eyes
shrewdly
on
marco
it
was
almost
as
if
he
were
asking
him
a
conundrum
he
knew
it
would
have
been
one
to
most
boys
of
the
class
he
appeared
outwardly
to
belong
to
he
would
either
know
the
answer
or
he
would
i
beg
your
pardon
the
rat
said
that
was
the
conundrum
it
was
what
a
gentleman
and
an
officer
would
have
said
if
he
felt
he
had
been
mistaken
or
rude
he
had
heard
that
from
his
drunken
father
i
beg
yours
for
being
late
said
marco
that
was
the
right
answer
it
was
the
one
another
officer
and
gentleman
would
have
made
it
settled
the
matter
at
once
and
it
settled
more
than
was
apparent
at
the
moment
it
decided
that
marco
was
one
of
those
who
knew
the
things
the
rat
father
had
once
known
the
things
gentlemen
do
and
say
and
think
not
another
word
was
said
it
was
all
right
marco
slipped
into
line
with
the
squad
and
the
rat
sat
erect
with
his
military
bearing
and
began
his
drill
squad
number
slope
arms
form
fours
right
quick
march
halt
left
turn
order
arms
stand
at
ease
stand
easy
they
did
it
so
well
that
it
was
quite
wonderful
when
one
considered
the
limited
space
at
their
disposal
they
had
evidently
done
it
often
and
the
rat
had
been
not
only
a
smart
but
a
severe
officer
this
morning
they
repeated
the
exercise
a
number
of
times
and
even
varied
it
with
review
drill
with
which
they
seemed
just
as
familiar
where
did
you
learn
it
the
rat
asked
when
the
arms
were
stacked
again
and
marco
was
sitting
by
him
as
he
had
sat
the
previous
day
from
an
old
soldier
and
i
like
to
watch
it
as
you
do
if
you
were
a
young
swell
in
the
guards
you
could
be
smarter
at
it
the
rat
said
the
way
you
hold
yourself
the
way
you
stand
got
it
wish
i
was
you
it
comes
natural
to
you
i
always
liked
to
watch
it
and
try
to
do
it
myself
i
did
when
i
was
a
little
fellow
answered
marco
i
been
trying
to
kick
it
into
these
chaps
for
more
than
a
year
said
the
rat
a
nice
job
i
had
of
it
it
nearly
made
me
sick
at
first
the
semicircle
in
front
of
him
only
giggled
or
laughed
outright
the
members
of
it
seemed
to
take
very
little
offense
at
his
cavalier
treatment
of
them
he
had
evidently
something
to
give
them
which
was
entertaining
enough
to
make
up
for
his
tyranny
and
indifference
he
thrust
his
hand
into
one
of
the
pockets
of
his
ragged
coat
and
drew
out
a
piece
of
newspaper
my
father
brought
home
this
wrapped
round
a
loaf
of
bread
he
said
see
what
it
says
there
he
handed
it
to
marco
pointing
to
some
words
printed
in
large
letters
at
the
head
of
a
column
marco
looked
at
it
and
sat
very
still
the
words
he
read
were
the
lost
prince
silence
is
still
the
order
was
the
first
thought
which
flashed
through
his
mind
silence
is
still
the
order
what
does
it
mean
he
said
aloud
there
is
much
of
it
i
wish
there
was
more
the
rat
said
fretfully
read
and
see
of
course
they
say
it
may
be
true
but
i
believe
it
is
they
say
that
people
think
some
one
knows
where
he
is
at
least
where
one
of
his
descendants
is
it
be
the
same
thing
he
be
the
real
king
if
he
just
show
himself
it
might
stop
all
the
fighting
just
read
marco
read
and
his
skin
prickled
as
the
blood
went
racing
through
his
body
but
his
face
did
not
change
there
was
a
sketch
of
the
story
of
the
lost
prince
to
begin
with
it
had
been
regarded
by
most
people
the
article
said
as
a
sort
of
legend
now
there
was
a
definite
rumor
that
it
was
not
a
legend
at
all
but
a
part
of
the
long
past
history
of
samavia
it
was
said
that
through
the
centuries
there
had
always
been
a
party
secretly
loyal
to
the
memory
of
this
worshiped
and
lost
fedorovitch
it
was
even
said
that
from
father
to
son
generation
after
generation
after
generation
had
descended
the
oath
of
fealty
to
him
and
his
descendants
the
people
had
made
a
god
of
him
and
now
romantic
as
it
seemed
it
was
beginning
to
be
an
open
secret
that
some
persons
believed
that
a
descendant
had
been
found
a
fedorovitch
worthy
of
his
young
ancestor
and
that
a
certain
secret
party
also
held
that
if
he
were
called
back
to
the
throne
of
samavia
the
interminable
wars
and
bloodshed
would
reach
an
end
the
rat
had
begun
to
bite
his
nails
fast
do
you
believe
he
found
he
asked
feverishly
i
do
i
wonder
where
he
is
if
it
true
i
wonder
where
exclaimed
marco
he
could
say
that
and
he
might
seem
as
eager
as
he
felt
the
squad
all
began
to
jabber
at
once
yus
where
there
is
no
knowin
it
be
likely
to
be
in
some
o
these
furrin
places
be
too
far
from
samavia
far
off
wos
samavia
wos
it
in
roosha
or
where
the
frenchies
were
or
the
germans
but
wherever
wos
be
the
right
sort
an
be
the
sort
a
chap
turn
and
look
at
in
the
street
the
rat
continued
to
bite
his
nails
he
might
be
anywhere
he
said
his
small
fierce
face
glowing
that
what
i
like
to
think
about
he
might
be
passing
in
the
street
outside
there
he
might
be
up
in
one
of
those
houses
jerking
his
head
over
his
shoulder
toward
the
backs
of
the
inclosing
dwellings
perhaps
he
knows
he
a
king
and
perhaps
he
does
he
know
if
what
you
said
yesterday
was
true
about
the
king
always
being
made
ready
for
samavia
yes
he
know
put
in
marco
well
it
be
finer
if
he
did
went
on
the
rat
however
poor
and
shabby
he
was
he
know
the
secret
all
the
time
and
if
people
sneered
at
him
he
sneer
at
them
and
laugh
to
himself
i
dare
say
he
walk
tremendously
straight
and
hold
his
head
up
if
i
was
him
i
like
to
make
people
suspect
a
bit
that
i
was
like
the
common
lot
o
them
he
put
out
his
hand
and
pushed
marco
excitedly
let
work
out
plots
for
him
he
said
that
be
a
splendid
game
let
pretend
we
the
secret
party
he
was
tremendously
excited
out
of
the
ragged
pocket
he
fished
a
piece
of
chalk
then
he
leaned
forward
and
began
to
draw
something
quickly
on
the
flagstones
closest
to
his
platform
the
squad
leaned
forward
also
quite
breathlessly
and
marco
leaned
forward
the
chalk
was
sketching
a
roughly
outlined
map
and
he
knew
what
map
it
was
before
the
rat
spoke
that
a
map
of
samavia
he
said
it
was
in
that
piece
of
magazine
i
told
you
about
the
one
where
i
read
about
prince
ivor
i
studied
it
until
it
fell
to
pieces
but
i
could
draw
it
myself
by
that
time
so
it
did
matter
i
could
draw
it
with
my
eyes
shut
that
the
capital
city
pointing
to
a
spot
it
called
melzarr
the
palace
is
there
it
the
place
where
the
first
of
the
maranovitch
killed
the
last
of
the
fedorovitch
the
bad
chap
that
was
ivor
father
it
the
palace
ivor
wandered
out
of
singing
the
shepherds
song
that
early
morning
it
where
the
throne
is
that
his
descendant
would
sit
upon
to
be
crowned
that
he
to
sit
upon
i
believe
he
is
let
swear
he
shall
he
flung
down
his
piece
of
chalk
and
sat
up
give
me
two
sticks
help
me
to
get
up
two
of
the
squad
sprang
to
their
feet
and
came
to
him
each
snatched
one
of
the
sticks
from
the
stacked
rifles
evidently
knowing
what
he
wanted
marco
rose
too
and
watched
with
sudden
keen
curiosity
he
had
thought
that
the
rat
could
not
stand
up
but
it
seemed
that
he
could
in
a
fashion
of
his
own
and
he
was
going
to
do
it
the
boys
lifted
him
by
his
arms
set
him
against
the
stone
coping
of
the
iron
railings
of
the
churchyard
and
put
a
stick
in
each
of
his
hands
they
stood
at
his
side
but
he
supported
himself
could
get
about
if
the
money
to
buy
crutches
said
one
whose
name
was
cad
and
he
said
it
quite
proudly
the
queer
thing
that
marco
had
noticed
was
that
the
ragamuffins
were
proud
of
the
rat
and
regarded
him
as
their
lord
and
could
get
about
an
stand
as
well
as
any
one
added
the
other
and
he
said
it
in
the
tone
of
one
who
boasts
his
name
was
ben
i
going
to
stand
now
and
so
are
the
rest
of
you
said
the
rat
squad
you
at
the
head
of
the
line
to
marco
they
were
in
line
in
a
moment
straight
shoulders
back
chins
up
and
marco
stood
at
the
head
we
going
to
take
an
oath
said
the
rat
it
an
oath
of
allegiance
allegiance
means
faithfulness
to
a
thing
a
king
or
a
country
ours
means
allegiance
to
the
king
of
samavia
we
do
know
where
he
is
but
we
swear
to
be
faithful
to
him
to
fight
for
him
to
plot
for
him
to
for
him
and
to
bring
him
back
to
his
throne
the
way
in
which
he
flung
up
his
head
when
he
said
the
word
die
was
very
fine
indeed
we
are
the
secret
party
we
will
work
in
the
dark
and
find
out
things
and
run
risks
and
collect
an
army
no
one
will
know
anything
about
until
it
is
strong
enough
to
suddenly
rise
at
a
secret
signal
and
overwhelm
the
maranovitch
and
iarovitch
and
seize
their
forts
and
citadels
no
one
even
knows
we
are
alive
we
are
a
silent
secret
thing
that
never
speaks
aloud
silent
and
secret
as
they
were
however
they
spoke
aloud
at
this
juncture
it
was
such
a
grand
idea
for
a
game
and
so
full
of
possible
larks
that
the
squad
broke
into
a
howl
of
an
exultant
cheer
hooray
they
yelled
hooray
for
the
oath
of
shut
up
you
swine
shouted
the
rat
is
that
the
way
you
keep
yourself
secret
you
call
the
police
in
you
fools
look
at
pointing
to
marco
he
got
some
sense
marco
in
fact
had
not
made
any
sound
come
here
you
cad
and
ben
and
put
me
back
on
my
wheels
raged
the
squad
commander
i
not
make
up
the
game
at
all
it
no
use
with
a
lot
of
raw
recruits
like
you
the
line
broke
and
surrounded
him
in
a
moment
pleading
and
urging
aw
rat
we
forgot
it
the
primest
game
you
ever
thought
out
rat
rat
do
get
a
grouch
on
we
keep
still
rat
primest
lark
of
all
be
the
sneakin
about
an
keepin
quiet
aw
rat
keep
it
up
keep
it
up
yourselves
snarled
the
rat
not
another
cove
of
us
could
do
it
but
you
not
one
there
no
other
cove
could
think
it
out
you
the
only
chap
that
can
think
out
things
you
thought
out
the
squad
that
why
you
captain
this
was
true
he
was
the
one
who
could
invent
entertainment
for
them
these
street
lads
who
had
nothing
out
of
that
nothing
he
could
create
what
excited
them
and
give
them
something
to
fill
empty
useless
often
cold
or
wet
or
foggy
hours
that
made
him
their
captain
and
their
pride
the
rat
began
to
yield
though
grudgingly
he
pointed
again
to
marco
who
had
not
moved
but
stood
still
at
attention
look
at
he
said
he
knows
enough
to
stand
where
he
put
until
he
ordered
to
break
line
he
a
soldier
he
is
not
a
raw
recruit
that
do
know
the
he
been
in
barracks
before
but
after
this
outburst
he
deigned
to
go
on
here
the
oath
he
said
we
swear
to
stand
any
torture
and
submit
in
silence
to
any
death
rather
than
betray
our
secret
and
our
king
we
will
obey
in
silence
and
in
secret
we
will
swim
through
seas
of
blood
and
fight
our
way
through
lakes
of
fire
if
we
are
ordered
nothing
shall
bar
our
way
all
we
do
and
say
and
think
is
for
our
country
and
our
king
if
any
of
you
have
anything
to
say
speak
out
before
you
take
the
oath
he
saw
marco
move
a
little
and
he
made
a
sign
to
him
you
he
said
have
you
something
to
say
marco
turned
to
him
and
saluted
here
stand
ten
men
for
samavia
god
be
thanked
he
said
he
dared
say
that
much
and
he
felt
as
if
his
father
himself
would
have
told
him
that
they
were
the
right
words
the
rat
thought
they
were
somehow
he
felt
that
they
struck
home
he
reddened
with
a
sudden
emotion
squad
he
said
i
let
you
give
three
cheers
on
that
it
for
the
last
time
we
begin
to
be
quiet
afterward
and
to
the
squad
exultant
relief
he
led
the
cheer
and
they
were
allowed
to
make
as
much
uproar
as
they
liked
they
liked
to
make
a
great
deal
and
when
it
was
at
an
end
it
had
done
them
good
and
made
them
ready
for
business
the
rat
opened
the
drama
at
once
never
surely
had
there
ever
before
been
heard
a
conspirator
whisper
as
hollow
as
his
secret
ones
he
said
it
is
midnight
we
meet
in
the
depths
of
darkness
we
dare
not
meet
by
day
when
we
meet
in
the
daytime
we
pretend
not
to
know
each
other
we
are
meeting
now
in
a
samavian
city
where
there
is
a
fortress
we
shall
have
to
take
it
when
the
secret
sign
is
given
and
we
make
our
rising
we
are
getting
everything
ready
so
that
when
we
find
the
king
the
secret
sign
can
be
given
what
is
the
name
of
the
city
we
are
in
whispered
cad
it
is
called
larrina
it
is
an
important
seaport
we
must
take
it
as
soon
as
we
rise
the
next
time
we
meet
i
will
bring
a
dark
lantern
and
draw
a
map
and
show
it
to
you
it
would
have
been
a
great
advantage
to
the
game
if
marco
could
have
drawn
for
them
the
map
he
could
have
made
a
map
which
would
have
shown
every
fortress
every
stronghold
and
every
weak
place
being
a
boy
he
knew
what
excitement
would
have
thrilled
each
breast
how
they
would
lean
forward
and
pile
question
on
question
pointing
to
this
place
and
to
that
he
had
learned
to
draw
the
map
before
he
was
ten
and
he
had
drawn
it
again
and
again
because
there
had
been
times
when
his
father
had
told
him
that
changes
had
taken
place
oh
yes
he
could
have
drawn
a
map
which
would
have
moved
them
to
a
frenzy
of
joy
but
he
sat
silent
and
listened
only
speaking
when
he
asked
a
question
as
if
he
knew
nothing
more
about
samavia
than
the
rat
did
what
a
secret
party
they
were
they
drew
themselves
together
in
the
closest
of
circles
they
spoke
in
unearthly
whispers
a
sentinel
ought
to
be
posted
at
the
end
of
the
passage
marco
whispered
ben
take
your
gun
commanded
the
rat
ben
rose
stealthily
and
shouldering
his
weapon
crept
on
tiptoe
to
the
opening
there
he
stood
on
guard
my
father
says
there
been
a
secret
party
in
samavia
for
a
hundred
years
the
rat
whispered
who
told
him
asked
marco
a
man
who
has
been
in
samavia
answered
the
rat
he
said
it
was
the
most
wonderful
secret
party
in
the
world
because
it
has
worked
and
waited
so
long
and
never
given
up
though
it
has
had
no
reason
for
hoping
it
began
among
some
shepherds
and
who
bound
themselves
by
an
oath
to
find
the
lost
prince
and
bring
him
back
to
the
throne
there
were
too
few
of
them
to
do
anything
against
the
maranovitch
and
when
the
first
lot
found
they
were
growing
old
they
made
their
sons
take
the
same
oath
it
has
been
passed
on
from
generation
to
generation
and
in
each
generation
the
band
has
grown
no
one
really
knows
how
large
it
is
now
but
they
say
that
there
are
people
in
nearly
all
the
countries
in
europe
who
belong
to
it
in
dead
secret
and
are
sworn
to
help
it
when
they
are
called
they
are
only
waiting
some
are
rich
people
who
will
give
money
and
some
are
poor
ones
who
will
slip
across
the
frontier
to
fight
or
to
help
to
smuggle
in
arms
they
even
say
that
for
all
these
years
there
have
been
arms
made
in
caves
in
the
mountains
and
hidden
there
year
after
year
there
are
men
who
are
called
forgers
of
the
sword
and
they
and
their
fathers
and
grandfathers
and
have
always
made
swords
and
stored
them
in
caverns
no
one
knows
of
hidden
caverns
underground
marco
spoke
aloud
the
thought
which
had
come
into
his
mind
as
he
listened
a
thought
which
brought
fear
to
him
if
the
people
in
the
streets
talk
about
it
they
wo
be
hidden
long
it
is
common
talk
my
father
says
only
very
few
have
guessed
and
most
of
them
think
it
is
part
of
the
lost
prince
legend
said
the
rat
the
maranovitch
and
iarovitch
laugh
at
it
they
have
always
been
great
fools
they
too
full
of
their
own
swagger
to
think
anything
can
interfere
with
them
do
you
talk
much
to
your
father
marco
asked
him
the
rat
showed
his
sharp
white
teeth
in
a
grin
i
know
what
you
thinking
of
he
said
you
remembering
that
i
said
he
was
always
drunk
so
he
is
except
when
he
only
drunk
and
when
he
drunk
he
the
most
splendid
talker
in
london
he
remembers
everything
he
has
ever
learned
or
read
or
heard
since
he
was
born
i
get
him
going
and
listen
he
wants
to
talk
and
i
want
to
hear
i
found
out
almost
everything
i
know
in
that
way
he
did
know
he
was
teaching
me
but
he
was
he
goes
back
into
being
a
gentleman
when
half
drunk
if
if
you
care
about
the
samavians
you
better
ask
him
not
to
tell
people
about
the
secret
party
and
the
forgers
of
the
sword
suggested
marco
the
rat
started
a
little
that
true
he
said
you
sharper
than
i
am
it
ought
to
be
blabbed
about
or
the
maranovitch
might
hear
enough
to
make
them
stop
and
listen
i
get
him
to
promise
there
one
queer
thing
about
him
he
added
very
slowly
as
if
he
were
thinking
it
over
i
suppose
part
of
the
gentleman
that
left
in
him
if
he
makes
a
promise
he
never
breaks
it
drunk
or
sober
ask
him
to
make
one
said
marco
the
next
moment
he
changed
the
subject
because
it
seemed
the
best
thing
to
do
go
on
and
tell
us
what
our
own
secret
party
is
to
do
we
forgetting
he
whispered
the
rat
took
up
his
game
with
renewed
keenness
it
was
a
game
which
attracted
him
immensely
because
it
called
upon
his
imagination
and
held
his
audience
spellbound
besides
plunging
him
into
war
and
strategy
we
preparing
for
the
rising
he
said
it
must
come
soon
waited
so
long
the
caverns
are
stacked
with
arms
the
maranovitch
and
the
iarovitch
are
fighting
and
using
all
their
soldiers
and
now
is
our
time
he
stopped
and
thought
his
elbows
on
his
knees
he
began
to
bite
his
nails
again
the
secret
signal
must
be
given
he
said
then
he
stopped
again
and
the
squad
held
its
breath
and
pressed
nearer
with
a
softly
shuffling
sound
two
of
the
secret
ones
must
be
chosen
by
lot
and
sent
forth
he
went
on
and
the
squad
almost
brought
ruin
and
disgrace
upon
itself
by
wanting
to
cheer
again
and
only
just
stopping
itself
in
time
must
be
chosen
the
rat
repeated
looking
from
one
face
to
another
each
one
will
take
his
life
in
his
hand
when
he
goes
forth
he
may
have
to
die
a
thousand
deaths
but
he
must
go
he
must
steal
in
silence
and
disguise
from
one
country
to
another
wherever
there
is
one
of
the
secret
party
whether
he
is
in
a
hovel
or
on
a
throne
the
messengers
must
go
to
him
in
darkness
and
stealth
and
give
him
the
sign
it
will
mean
hour
has
come
god
save
samavia
god
save
samavia
whispered
the
squad
excitedly
and
because
they
saw
marco
raise
his
hand
to
his
forehead
every
one
of
them
saluted
they
all
began
to
whisper
at
once
let
draw
lots
now
let
draw
lots
rat
do
let
no
waitin
the
rat
began
to
look
about
him
with
dread
anxiety
he
seemed
to
be
examining
the
sky
the
darkness
is
not
as
thick
as
it
was
he
whispered
midnight
has
passed
the
dawn
of
day
will
be
upon
us
if
any
one
has
a
piece
of
paper
or
a
string
we
will
draw
the
lots
before
we
part
cad
had
a
piece
of
string
and
marco
had
a
knife
which
could
be
used
to
cut
it
into
lengths
this
the
rat
did
himself
then
after
shutting
his
eyes
and
mixing
them
he
held
them
in
his
hand
ready
for
the
drawing
the
secret
one
who
draws
the
longest
lot
is
chosen
the
secret
one
who
draws
the
shortest
is
chosen
he
said
solemnly
the
drawing
was
as
solemn
as
his
tone
each
boy
wanted
to
draw
either
the
shortest
lot
or
the
longest
one
the
heart
of
each
thumped
somewhat
as
he
drew
his
piece
of
string
when
the
drawing
was
at
an
end
each
showed
his
lot
the
rat
had
drawn
the
shortest
piece
of
string
and
marco
had
drawn
the
longest
one
comrade
said
the
rat
taking
his
hand
we
will
face
death
and
danger
together
god
save
samavia
answered
marco
and
the
game
was
at
an
end
for
the
day
the
primest
thing
the
squad
said
the
rat
had
ever
made
up
for
them
wos
a
wonder
he
wos
vii
the
lamp
is
lighted
on
his
way
home
marco
thought
of
nothing
but
the
story
he
must
tell
his
father
the
story
the
stranger
who
had
been
to
samavia
had
told
the
rat
father
he
felt
that
it
must
be
a
true
story
and
not
merely
an
invention
the
forgers
of
the
sword
must
be
real
men
and
the
hidden
subterranean
caverns
stacked
through
the
centuries
with
arms
must
be
real
too
and
if
they
were
real
surely
his
father
was
one
of
those
who
knew
the
secret
his
thoughts
ran
very
fast
the
rat
boyish
invention
of
the
rising
was
only
part
of
a
game
but
how
natural
it
would
be
that
sometime
perhaps
before
long
there
would
be
a
real
rising
surely
there
would
be
one
if
the
secret
party
had
grown
so
strong
and
if
many
weapons
and
secret
friends
in
other
countries
were
ready
and
waiting
during
all
these
years
hidden
work
and
preparation
would
have
been
going
on
continually
even
though
it
was
preparation
for
an
unknown
day
a
party
which
had
lasted
so
long
which
passed
its
oath
on
from
generation
to
generation
must
be
of
a
deadly
determination
what
might
it
not
have
made
ready
in
its
caverns
and
secret
he
longed
to
reach
home
and
tell
his
father
at
once
all
he
had
heard
he
recalled
to
mind
word
for
word
all
that
the
rat
had
been
told
and
even
all
he
had
added
in
his
game
because
well
because
that
seemed
so
real
too
so
real
that
it
actually
might
be
useful
but
when
he
reached
no
philibert
place
he
found
loristan
and
lazarus
very
much
absorbed
in
work
the
door
of
the
back
was
locked
when
he
first
knocked
on
it
and
locked
again
as
soon
as
he
had
entered
there
were
many
papers
on
the
table
and
they
were
evidently
studying
them
several
of
them
were
maps
some
were
road
maps
some
maps
of
towns
and
cities
and
some
of
fortifications
but
they
were
all
maps
of
places
in
samavia
they
were
usually
kept
in
a
strong
box
and
when
they
were
taken
out
to
be
studied
the
door
was
always
kept
locked
before
they
had
their
evening
meal
these
were
all
returned
to
the
strong
box
which
was
pushed
into
a
corner
and
had
newspapers
piled
upon
it
when
he
arrives
marco
heard
loristan
say
to
lazarus
we
can
show
him
clearly
what
has
been
planned
he
can
see
for
himself
his
father
spoke
scarcely
at
all
during
the
meal
and
though
it
was
not
the
habit
of
lazarus
to
speak
at
such
times
unless
spoken
to
this
evening
it
seemed
to
marco
that
he
more
silent
than
he
had
ever
seen
him
look
before
they
were
plainly
both
thinking
anxiously
of
deeply
serious
things
the
story
of
the
stranger
who
had
been
to
samavia
must
not
be
told
yet
but
it
was
one
which
would
keep
loristan
did
not
say
anything
until
lazarus
had
removed
the
things
from
the
table
and
made
the
room
as
neat
as
possible
while
that
was
being
done
he
sat
with
his
forehead
resting
on
his
hand
as
if
absorbed
in
thought
then
he
made
a
gesture
to
marco
come
here
comrade
he
said
marco
went
to
him
some
one
may
come
to
talk
with
me
about
grave
things
he
said
i
think
he
will
come
but
i
can
not
be
quite
sure
it
is
important
that
he
should
know
that
when
he
comes
he
will
find
me
quite
alone
he
will
come
at
a
late
hour
and
lazarus
will
open
the
door
quietly
that
no
one
may
hear
it
is
important
that
no
one
should
see
him
some
one
must
go
and
walk
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
until
he
appears
then
the
one
who
goes
to
give
warning
must
cross
the
pavement
before
him
and
say
in
a
low
voice
lamp
is
lighted
and
at
once
turn
quietly
away
what
boy
heart
would
not
have
leaped
with
joy
at
the
mystery
of
it
even
a
common
and
dull
boy
who
knew
nothing
of
samavia
would
have
felt
jerky
marco
voice
almost
shook
with
the
thrill
of
his
feeling
how
shall
i
know
him
he
said
at
once
without
asking
at
all
he
knew
he
was
the
some
one
who
was
to
go
you
have
seen
him
before
loristan
answered
he
is
the
man
who
drove
in
the
carriage
with
the
king
i
shall
know
him
said
marco
when
shall
i
go
not
until
it
is
one
go
to
bed
and
sleep
until
lazarus
calls
you
then
he
added
look
well
at
his
face
before
you
speak
he
will
probably
not
be
dressed
as
well
as
he
was
when
you
saw
him
first
marco
went
to
his
room
and
went
to
bed
as
he
was
told
but
it
was
hard
to
go
to
sleep
the
rattle
and
roaring
of
the
road
did
not
usually
keep
him
awake
because
he
had
lived
in
the
poorer
quarter
of
too
many
big
capital
cities
not
to
be
accustomed
to
noise
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
as
he
lay
and
looked
out
at
the
lamplight
he
heard
every
bus
and
cab
which
went
past
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
people
who
were
in
them
and
on
top
of
them
and
of
the
people
who
were
hurrying
along
on
the
pavement
outside
the
broken
iron
railings
he
was
wondering
what
they
would
think
if
they
knew
that
things
connected
with
the
battles
they
read
of
in
the
daily
papers
were
going
on
in
one
of
the
shabby
houses
they
scarcely
gave
a
glance
to
as
they
went
by
them
it
must
be
something
connected
with
the
war
if
a
man
who
was
a
great
diplomat
and
the
companion
of
kings
came
in
secret
to
talk
alone
with
a
patriot
who
was
a
samavian
whatever
his
father
was
doing
was
for
the
good
of
samavia
and
perhaps
the
secret
party
knew
he
was
doing
it
his
heart
almost
beat
aloud
under
his
shirt
as
he
lay
on
the
lumpy
mattress
thinking
it
over
he
must
indeed
look
well
at
the
stranger
before
he
even
moved
toward
him
he
must
be
sure
he
was
the
right
man
the
game
he
had
amused
himself
with
so
long
the
game
of
trying
to
remember
pictures
and
people
and
places
clearly
and
in
detail
had
been
a
wonderful
training
if
he
could
draw
he
knew
he
could
have
made
a
sketch
of
the
clever
aquiline
face
with
the
and
delicately
close
mouth
which
looked
as
if
it
had
been
shut
upon
secrets
always
always
if
he
could
draw
he
found
himself
saying
again
he
draw
though
perhaps
only
roughly
he
had
often
amused
himself
by
making
sketches
of
things
he
wanted
to
ask
questions
about
he
had
even
drawn
people
faces
in
his
untrained
way
and
his
father
had
said
that
he
had
a
crude
gift
for
catching
a
likeness
perhaps
he
could
make
a
sketch
of
this
face
which
would
show
his
father
that
he
knew
and
would
recognize
it
he
jumped
out
of
bed
and
went
to
a
table
near
the
window
there
was
paper
and
a
pencil
lying
on
it
a
street
lamp
exactly
opposite
threw
into
the
room
quite
light
enough
for
him
to
see
by
he
half
knelt
by
the
table
and
began
to
draw
he
worked
for
about
twenty
minutes
steadily
and
he
tore
up
two
or
three
unsatisfactory
sketches
the
poor
drawing
would
not
matter
if
he
could
catch
that
subtle
look
which
was
not
slyness
but
something
more
dignified
and
important
it
was
not
difficult
to
get
the
marked
aristocratic
outline
of
the
features
a
man
with
less
pronounced
profile
would
have
been
less
easy
to
draw
in
one
sense
he
gave
his
mind
wholly
to
the
recalling
of
every
detail
which
had
photographed
itself
on
his
memory
through
its
trained
habit
gradually
he
saw
that
the
likeness
was
becoming
clearer
it
was
not
long
before
it
was
clear
enough
to
be
a
striking
one
any
one
who
knew
the
man
would
recognize
it
he
got
up
drawing
a
long
and
joyful
breath
he
did
not
put
on
his
shoes
but
crossed
his
room
as
noiselessly
as
possible
and
as
noiselessly
opened
the
door
he
made
no
ghost
of
a
sound
when
he
went
down
the
stairs
the
woman
who
kept
the
had
gone
to
bed
and
so
had
the
other
lodgers
and
the
maid
of
all
work
all
the
lights
were
out
except
the
one
he
saw
a
glimmer
of
under
the
door
of
his
father
room
when
he
had
been
a
mere
baby
he
had
been
taught
to
make
a
special
sign
on
the
door
when
he
wished
to
speak
to
loristan
he
stood
still
outside
the
back
and
made
it
now
it
was
a
low
scratching
sound
two
scratches
and
a
soft
tap
lazarus
opened
the
door
and
looked
troubled
it
is
not
yet
time
sir
he
said
very
low
i
know
marco
answered
but
i
must
show
something
to
my
father
lazarus
let
him
in
and
loristan
turned
round
from
his
questioningly
marco
went
forward
and
laid
the
sketch
down
before
him
look
at
it
he
said
i
remember
him
well
enough
to
draw
that
i
thought
of
it
all
at
once
that
i
could
make
a
sort
of
picture
do
you
think
it
is
like
him
loristan
examined
it
closely
it
is
very
like
him
he
answered
you
have
made
me
feel
entirely
safe
thanks
comrade
it
was
a
good
idea
there
was
relief
in
the
grip
he
gave
the
boy
hand
and
marco
turned
away
with
an
exultant
feeling
just
as
he
reached
the
door
loristan
said
to
him
make
the
most
of
this
gift
it
is
a
gift
and
it
is
true
your
mind
has
had
good
training
the
more
you
draw
the
better
draw
everything
you
can
neither
the
street
lamps
nor
the
noises
nor
his
thoughts
kept
marco
awake
when
he
went
back
to
bed
but
before
he
settled
himself
upon
his
pillow
he
gave
himself
certain
orders
he
had
both
read
and
heard
loristan
say
that
the
mind
can
control
the
body
when
people
once
find
out
that
it
can
do
so
he
had
tried
experiments
himself
and
had
found
out
some
curious
things
one
was
that
if
he
told
himself
to
remember
a
certain
thing
at
a
certain
time
he
usually
found
that
he
remember
it
something
in
his
brain
seemed
to
remind
him
he
had
often
tried
the
experiment
of
telling
himself
to
awaken
at
a
particular
hour
and
had
awakened
almost
exactly
at
the
moment
by
the
clock
i
will
sleep
until
one
he
said
as
he
shut
his
eyes
then
i
will
awaken
and
feel
quite
fresh
i
shall
not
be
sleepy
at
all
he
slept
as
soundly
as
a
boy
can
sleep
and
at
one
exactly
he
awakened
and
found
the
street
lamp
still
throwing
its
light
through
the
window
he
knew
it
was
one
because
there
was
a
cheap
little
round
clock
on
the
table
and
he
could
see
the
time
he
was
quite
fresh
and
not
at
all
sleepy
his
experiment
had
succeeded
again
he
got
up
and
dressed
then
he
went
as
noiselessly
as
before
he
carried
his
shoes
in
his
hands
as
he
meant
to
put
them
on
only
when
he
reached
the
street
he
made
his
sign
at
his
father
door
and
it
was
loristan
who
opened
it
shall
i
go
now
marco
asked
yes
walk
slowly
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
look
in
every
direction
we
do
not
know
where
he
will
come
from
after
you
have
given
him
the
sign
then
come
in
and
go
to
bed
again
marco
saluted
as
a
soldier
would
have
done
on
receiving
an
order
then
without
a
second
delay
he
passed
noiselessly
out
of
the
house
loristan
turned
back
into
the
room
and
stood
silently
in
the
center
of
it
the
long
lines
of
his
handsome
body
looked
particularly
erect
and
stately
and
his
eyes
were
glowing
as
if
something
deeply
moved
him
there
grows
a
man
for
samavia
he
said
to
lazarus
who
watched
him
god
be
thanked
lazarus
voice
was
low
and
hoarse
and
he
saluted
quite
reverently
your
sir
he
said
god
save
the
prince
yes
loristan
answered
after
a
moment
hesitation
when
he
is
found
and
he
went
back
to
his
table
smiling
his
beautiful
smile
the
wonder
of
silence
in
the
deserted
streets
of
a
great
city
after
midnight
has
hushed
all
the
roar
and
tumult
to
rest
is
an
almost
unbelievable
thing
the
stillness
in
the
depths
of
a
forest
or
on
a
mountain
top
is
not
so
strange
a
few
hours
ago
the
tumult
was
rushing
past
in
a
few
hours
more
it
will
be
rushing
past
again
but
now
the
street
is
a
naked
thing
a
distant
policeman
tramp
on
the
bare
pavement
has
a
hollow
and
almost
fearsome
sound
it
seemed
especially
so
to
marco
as
he
crossed
the
road
had
it
ever
been
so
empty
and
deadly
silent
before
was
it
so
every
night
perhaps
it
was
when
he
was
fast
asleep
on
his
lumpy
mattress
with
the
light
from
a
street
lamp
streaming
into
the
room
he
listened
for
the
step
of
the
policeman
on
because
he
did
not
wish
to
be
seen
there
was
a
jutting
wall
where
he
could
stand
in
the
shadow
while
the
man
passed
a
policeman
would
stop
to
look
questioningly
at
a
boy
who
walked
up
and
down
the
pavement
at
one
in
the
morning
marco
could
wait
until
he
had
gone
by
and
then
come
out
into
the
light
and
look
up
and
down
the
road
and
the
cross
streets
he
heard
his
approaching
footsteps
in
a
few
minutes
and
was
safely
in
the
shadows
before
he
could
be
seen
when
the
policeman
passed
he
came
out
and
walked
slowly
down
the
road
looking
on
each
side
and
now
and
then
looking
back
at
first
no
one
was
in
sight
then
a
late
came
tinkling
along
but
the
people
in
it
were
returning
from
some
festivity
and
were
laughing
and
talking
and
noticed
nothing
but
their
own
joking
then
there
was
silence
again
and
for
a
long
time
as
it
seemed
to
marco
no
one
was
to
be
seen
it
was
not
really
so
long
as
it
appeared
because
he
was
anxious
then
a
very
early
on
the
way
from
the
country
to
covent
garden
market
came
slowly
lumbering
by
with
its
driver
almost
asleep
on
his
piles
of
potatoes
and
cabbages
after
it
had
passed
there
was
stillness
and
emptiness
once
more
until
the
policeman
showed
himself
again
on
his
beat
and
marco
slipped
into
the
shadow
of
the
wall
as
he
had
done
before
when
he
came
out
into
the
light
he
had
begun
to
hope
that
the
time
would
not
seem
long
to
his
father
it
had
not
really
been
long
he
told
himself
it
had
only
seemed
so
but
his
father
anxiousness
would
be
greater
than
his
own
could
be
loristan
knew
all
that
depended
on
the
coming
of
this
great
man
who
sat
side
by
side
with
a
king
in
his
carriage
and
talked
to
him
as
if
he
knew
him
well
it
might
be
something
which
all
samavia
is
waiting
to
know
at
least
all
the
secret
party
marco
thought
the
secret
party
is
samavia
he
started
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
some
one
is
coming
he
said
it
is
a
man
it
was
a
man
who
was
walking
up
the
road
on
the
same
side
of
the
pavement
as
his
own
marco
began
to
walk
toward
him
quietly
but
rather
rapidly
he
thought
it
might
be
best
to
appear
as
if
he
were
some
boy
sent
on
a
midnight
errand
perhaps
to
call
a
doctor
then
if
it
was
a
stranger
he
passed
no
suspicion
would
be
aroused
was
this
man
as
tall
as
the
one
who
had
driven
with
the
king
yes
he
was
about
the
same
height
but
he
was
too
far
away
to
be
recognizable
otherwise
he
drew
nearer
and
marco
noticed
that
he
also
seemed
slightly
to
hasten
his
footsteps
marco
went
on
a
little
nearer
and
he
would
be
able
to
make
sure
yes
now
he
was
near
enough
yes
this
man
was
the
same
height
and
not
unlike
in
figure
but
he
was
much
younger
he
was
not
the
one
who
had
been
in
the
carriage
with
his
majesty
he
was
not
more
than
thirty
years
old
he
began
swinging
his
cane
and
whistling
a
song
softly
as
marco
passed
him
without
changing
his
pace
it
was
after
the
policeman
had
walked
round
his
beat
and
disappeared
for
the
third
time
that
marco
heard
footsteps
echoing
at
some
distance
down
a
cross
street
after
listening
to
make
sure
that
they
were
approaching
instead
of
receding
in
another
direction
he
placed
himself
at
a
point
where
he
could
watch
the
length
of
the
thoroughfare
yes
some
one
was
coming
it
was
a
man
figure
again
he
was
able
to
place
himself
rather
in
the
shadow
so
that
the
person
approaching
would
not
see
that
he
was
being
watched
the
solitary
walker
reached
a
recognizable
distance
in
about
two
minutes
time
he
was
dressed
in
an
ordinary
suit
of
clothes
which
was
rather
shabby
and
quite
unnoticeable
in
its
appearance
his
common
hat
was
worn
so
that
it
rather
shaded
his
face
but
even
before
he
had
crossed
to
marco
side
of
the
road
the
boy
had
clearly
recognized
him
it
was
the
man
who
had
driven
with
the
king
chance
was
with
marco
the
man
crossed
at
exactly
the
place
which
made
it
easy
for
the
boy
to
step
lightly
from
behind
him
walk
a
few
paces
by
his
side
and
then
pass
directly
before
him
across
the
pavement
glancing
quietly
up
into
his
face
as
he
said
in
a
low
voice
but
distinctly
the
words
the
lamp
is
lighted
and
without
pausing
a
second
walk
on
his
way
down
the
road
he
did
not
slacken
his
pace
or
look
back
until
he
was
some
distance
away
then
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
and
saw
that
the
figure
had
crossed
the
street
and
was
inside
the
railings
it
was
all
right
his
father
would
not
be
disappointed
the
great
man
had
come
he
walked
for
about
ten
minutes
and
then
went
home
and
to
bed
but
he
was
obliged
to
tell
himself
to
go
to
sleep
several
times
before
his
eyes
closed
for
the
rest
of
the
night
viii
an
exciting
game
loristan
referred
only
once
during
the
next
day
to
what
had
happened
you
did
your
errand
well
you
were
not
hurried
or
nervous
he
said
the
prince
was
pleased
with
your
calmness
no
more
was
said
marco
knew
that
the
quiet
mention
of
the
title
had
been
made
merely
as
a
designation
if
it
was
necessary
to
mention
him
again
in
the
future
he
could
be
referred
to
as
the
prince
in
various
continental
countries
there
were
many
princes
who
were
not
royal
or
even
serene
highnesses
who
were
merely
princes
as
other
nobles
were
dukes
or
barons
nothing
special
was
revealed
when
a
man
was
spoken
of
as
a
prince
but
though
nothing
was
said
on
the
subject
of
the
incident
it
was
plain
that
much
work
was
being
done
by
loristan
and
lazarus
the
door
was
locked
and
the
maps
and
documents
usually
kept
in
the
iron
box
were
being
used
marco
went
to
the
tower
of
london
and
spent
part
of
the
day
in
living
again
the
stories
which
centuries
past
had
been
inclosed
within
its
massive
and
ancient
stone
walls
in
this
way
he
had
throughout
boyhood
become
intimate
with
people
who
to
most
boys
seemed
only
the
unreal
creatures
who
professed
to
be
alive
in
of
history
he
had
learned
to
know
them
as
men
and
women
because
he
had
stood
in
the
palaces
they
had
been
born
in
and
had
played
in
as
children
had
died
in
at
the
end
he
had
seen
the
dungeons
they
had
been
imprisoned
in
the
blocks
on
which
they
had
laid
their
heads
the
battlements
on
which
they
had
fought
to
defend
their
fortressed
towers
the
thrones
they
had
sat
upon
the
crowns
they
had
worn
and
the
jeweled
scepters
they
had
held
he
had
stood
before
their
portraits
and
had
gazed
curiously
at
their
robes
of
investiture
sewn
with
tens
of
thousands
of
to
look
at
a
man
face
and
feel
his
pictured
eyes
follow
you
as
you
move
away
from
him
to
see
the
strangely
splendid
garments
he
once
warmed
with
his
living
flesh
is
to
realize
that
history
is
not
a
mere
lesson
in
a
but
is
a
relation
of
the
life
stories
of
men
and
women
who
saw
strange
and
splendid
days
and
sometimes
suffered
strange
and
terrible
things
there
were
only
a
few
people
who
were
being
led
about
the
man
in
the
ancient
costume
who
was
their
guide
was
and
evidently
fond
of
talking
he
was
a
big
and
stout
man
with
a
large
face
and
a
small
merry
eye
he
was
rather
like
pictures
of
henry
the
eighth
himself
which
marco
remembered
having
seen
he
was
specially
talkative
when
he
stood
by
the
tablet
that
marks
the
spot
where
stood
the
block
on
which
lady
jane
grey
had
laid
her
young
head
one
of
the
sightseers
who
knew
little
of
english
history
had
asked
some
questions
about
the
reasons
for
her
execution
if
her
the
duke
of
northumberland
had
left
that
young
couple
alone
her
and
her
husband
lord
guildford
dudley
they
have
kept
their
heads
on
he
was
bound
to
make
her
a
queen
and
mary
tudor
was
bound
to
be
queen
herself
the
duke
was
clever
enough
to
manage
a
conspiracy
and
work
up
the
people
these
samavians
we
reading
about
in
the
papers
would
have
done
it
better
and
they
they
had
a
big
battle
outside
melzarr
yesterday
the
standing
next
to
marco
said
to
the
young
woman
who
was
his
companion
thousands
of
killed
i
saw
it
in
big
letters
on
the
boards
as
i
rode
on
the
top
of
the
bus
they
just
slaughtering
each
other
what
they
doing
the
talkative
heard
him
they
ca
even
bury
their
dead
fast
enough
he
said
there
be
some
sort
of
plague
breaking
out
and
sweeping
into
the
countries
nearest
them
it
end
by
spreading
all
over
europe
as
it
did
in
the
middle
ages
what
the
civilized
countries
have
got
to
do
is
to
make
them
choose
a
decent
king
and
begin
to
behave
themselves
i
tell
my
father
that
too
marco
thought
it
shows
that
everybody
is
thinking
and
talking
of
samavia
and
that
even
the
common
people
know
it
must
have
a
real
king
this
must
be
and
what
he
meant
was
that
this
must
be
the
time
for
which
the
secret
party
had
waited
and
worked
so
long
the
time
for
the
rising
but
his
father
was
out
when
he
went
back
to
philibert
place
and
lazarus
looked
more
silent
than
ever
as
he
stood
behind
his
chair
and
waited
on
him
through
his
insignificant
meal
however
plain
and
scant
the
food
they
had
to
eat
it
was
always
served
with
as
much
care
and
ceremony
as
if
it
had
been
a
banquet
a
man
can
eat
dry
bread
and
drink
cold
water
as
if
he
were
a
gentleman
his
father
had
said
long
ago
and
it
is
easy
to
form
careless
habits
even
if
one
is
hungry
enough
to
feel
ravenous
a
man
who
has
been
well
bred
will
not
allow
himself
to
look
so
a
dog
may
a
man
may
not
just
as
a
dog
may
howl
when
he
is
angry
or
in
pain
and
a
man
may
not
it
was
only
one
of
the
small
parts
of
the
training
which
had
quietly
made
the
boy
even
as
a
child
and
courteous
had
taught
him
ease
and
grace
of
boyish
carriage
the
habit
of
holding
his
body
well
and
his
head
erect
and
had
given
him
a
certain
look
of
young
distinction
which
though
it
assumed
nothing
set
him
apart
from
boys
of
carelessly
awkward
bearing
is
there
a
newspaper
here
which
tells
of
the
battle
lazarus
he
asked
after
he
had
left
the
table
yes
sir
was
the
answer
your
father
said
that
you
might
read
it
it
is
a
black
tale
he
added
as
he
handed
him
the
paper
it
was
a
black
tale
as
he
read
marco
felt
as
if
he
could
scarcely
bear
it
it
was
as
if
samavia
swam
in
blood
and
as
if
the
other
countries
must
stand
aghast
before
such
furious
cruelties
lazarus
he
said
springing
to
his
feet
at
last
his
eyes
burning
something
must
stop
it
there
must
be
something
strong
enough
the
time
has
come
the
time
has
come
and
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
because
he
was
too
excited
to
stand
still
how
lazarus
watched
him
what
a
strong
and
glowing
feeling
there
was
in
his
own
restrained
face
yes
sir
surely
the
time
has
come
he
answered
but
that
was
all
he
said
and
he
turned
and
went
out
of
the
shabby
back
at
once
it
was
as
if
he
felt
it
were
wiser
to
go
before
he
lost
power
over
himself
and
said
more
marco
made
his
way
to
the
of
the
squad
to
which
the
rat
had
in
the
past
given
the
name
of
the
barracks
the
rat
was
sitting
among
his
followers
and
he
had
been
reading
the
morning
paper
to
them
the
one
which
contained
the
account
of
the
battle
of
melzarr
the
squad
had
become
the
secret
party
and
each
member
of
it
was
thrilled
with
the
spirit
of
dark
plot
and
adventure
they
all
whispered
when
they
spoke
this
is
not
the
barracks
now
the
rat
said
it
is
a
subterranean
cavern
under
the
floor
of
it
thousands
of
swords
and
guns
are
buried
and
it
is
piled
to
the
roof
with
them
there
is
only
a
small
place
left
for
us
to
sit
and
plot
in
we
crawl
in
through
a
hole
and
the
hole
is
hidden
by
bushes
to
the
rest
of
the
boys
this
was
only
an
exciting
game
but
marco
knew
that
to
the
rat
it
was
more
though
the
rat
knew
none
of
the
things
he
knew
he
saw
that
the
whole
story
seemed
to
him
a
real
thing
the
struggles
of
samavia
as
he
had
heard
and
read
of
them
in
the
newspapers
had
taken
possession
of
him
his
passion
for
soldiering
and
warfare
and
his
curiously
mature
brain
had
led
him
into
following
every
detail
he
could
lay
hold
of
he
had
listened
to
all
he
had
heard
with
remarkable
results
he
remembered
things
older
people
forgot
after
they
had
mentioned
them
he
forgot
nothing
he
had
drawn
on
the
flagstones
a
map
of
samavia
which
marco
saw
was
actually
correct
and
he
had
made
a
rough
sketch
of
melzarr
and
the
battle
which
had
had
such
disastrous
results
the
maranovitch
had
possession
of
melzarr
he
explained
with
feverish
eagerness
and
the
iarovitch
attacked
them
from
here
pointing
with
his
finger
that
was
a
mistake
i
should
have
attacked
them
from
a
place
where
they
would
not
have
been
expecting
it
they
expected
attack
on
their
fortifications
and
they
were
ready
to
defend
them
i
believe
the
enemy
could
have
stolen
up
in
the
night
and
rushed
in
here
pointing
again
marco
thought
he
was
right
the
rat
had
argued
it
all
out
and
had
studied
melzarr
as
he
might
have
studied
a
puzzle
or
an
arithmetical
problem
he
was
very
clever
and
as
sharp
as
his
queer
face
looked
i
believe
you
would
make
a
good
general
if
you
were
grown
up
said
marco
i
like
to
show
your
maps
to
my
father
and
ask
him
if
he
does
think
your
stratagem
would
have
been
a
good
one
does
he
know
much
about
samavia
asked
the
rat
he
has
to
read
the
newspapers
because
he
writes
things
marco
answered
and
every
one
is
thinking
about
the
war
no
one
can
help
it
the
rat
drew
a
dingy
folded
paper
out
of
his
pocket
and
looked
it
over
with
an
air
of
reflection
i
make
a
clean
one
he
said
i
like
a
man
to
look
at
it
and
see
if
it
all
right
my
father
was
more
than
when
i
was
drawing
this
so
i
could
ask
him
questions
he
kill
himself
before
long
he
had
a
sort
of
fit
last
night
tell
us
rat
wot
you
an
marco
ter
do
let
wot
made
up
suggested
cad
he
drew
closer
and
so
did
the
rest
of
the
circle
hugging
their
knees
with
their
arms
this
is
what
we
shall
have
to
do
began
the
rat
in
the
hollow
whisper
of
a
secret
party
hour
has
to
all
the
secret
ones
in
samavia
and
to
the
friends
of
the
secret
party
in
every
country
the
sign
must
be
carried
it
must
be
carried
by
some
one
who
could
not
be
suspected
who
would
suspect
two
boys
and
one
of
them
a
cripple
the
best
thing
of
all
for
us
is
that
i
am
a
cripple
who
would
suspect
a
cripple
when
my
father
is
drunk
and
beats
me
he
does
it
because
i
wo
go
out
and
beg
in
the
streets
and
bring
him
the
money
i
get
he
says
that
people
will
nearly
always
give
money
to
a
cripple
i
wo
be
a
beggar
for
him
the
swine
but
i
will
be
one
for
samavia
and
the
lost
prince
marco
shall
pretend
to
be
my
brother
and
take
care
of
me
i
say
speaking
to
marco
with
a
sudden
change
of
voice
can
you
sing
anything
it
does
matter
how
you
do
it
yes
i
can
sing
marco
replied
then
marco
will
pretend
he
is
singing
to
make
people
give
him
money
i
get
a
pair
of
crutches
somewhere
and
part
of
the
time
i
will
go
on
crutches
and
part
of
the
time
on
my
platform
we
live
like
beggars
and
go
wherever
we
want
to
i
can
whiz
past
a
man
and
give
the
sign
and
no
one
will
know
some
times
marco
can
give
it
when
people
are
dropping
money
into
his
cap
we
can
pass
from
one
country
to
another
and
rouse
everybody
who
is
of
the
secret
party
we
work
our
way
into
samavia
and
we
be
only
two
boys
and
one
a
cripple
and
nobody
will
think
we
could
be
doing
anything
we
beg
in
great
cities
and
on
the
highroad
where
you
get
the
money
to
travel
said
cad
the
secret
party
will
give
it
to
us
and
we
need
much
we
could
beg
enough
for
that
matter
we
sleep
under
the
stars
or
under
bridges
or
archways
or
in
dark
corners
of
streets
i
done
it
myself
many
a
time
when
my
father
drove
me
out
of
doors
if
it
cold
weather
it
bad
enough
but
if
it
fine
weather
it
better
than
sleeping
in
the
kind
of
place
i
used
to
comrade
to
marco
are
you
ready
he
said
comrade
as
loristan
did
and
somehow
marco
did
not
resent
it
because
he
was
ready
to
labor
for
samavia
it
was
only
a
game
but
it
made
them
comrades
and
was
it
really
only
a
game
after
all
his
excited
voice
and
his
strange
lined
face
made
it
singularly
unlike
one
yes
comrade
i
am
ready
marco
answered
him
we
shall
be
in
samavia
when
the
fighting
for
the
lost
prince
begins
the
rat
carried
on
his
story
with
fire
we
may
see
a
battle
we
might
do
something
to
help
we
might
carry
messages
under
a
rain
of
bullets
a
rain
of
bullets
the
thought
so
elated
him
that
he
forgot
his
whisper
and
his
voice
rang
out
fiercely
boys
have
been
in
battles
before
we
might
find
the
lost
king
no
the
found
king
and
ask
him
to
let
us
be
his
servants
he
could
send
us
where
he
could
send
bigger
people
i
could
say
to
him
majesty
i
am
called
the
rat
because
i
can
creep
through
holes
and
into
corners
and
dart
about
order
me
into
any
danger
and
i
will
obey
you
let
me
die
like
a
soldier
if
i
ca
live
like
one
suddenly
he
threw
his
ragged
coat
sleeve
up
across
his
eyes
he
had
wrought
himself
up
tremendously
with
the
picture
of
the
rain
of
bullets
and
he
felt
as
if
he
saw
the
king
who
had
at
last
been
found
the
next
moment
he
uncovered
his
face
that
what
we
got
to
do
he
said
just
that
if
you
want
to
know
and
a
lot
more
there
no
end
to
it
marco
thoughts
were
in
a
whirl
it
ought
not
to
be
nothing
but
a
game
he
grew
quite
hot
all
over
if
the
secret
party
wanted
to
send
messengers
no
one
would
think
of
suspecting
who
could
be
more
than
two
vagabond
boys
wandering
about
picking
up
their
living
as
best
they
could
not
seeming
to
belong
to
any
one
and
one
a
cripple
it
was
true
yes
it
was
true
as
the
rat
said
that
his
being
a
cripple
made
him
look
safer
than
any
one
else
marco
actually
put
his
forehead
in
his
hands
and
pressed
his
temples
what
the
matter
exclaimed
the
rat
what
are
you
thinking
about
i
thinking
what
a
general
you
would
make
i
thinking
that
it
might
all
be
real
every
word
of
it
it
might
be
a
game
at
all
said
marco
no
it
might
the
rat
answered
if
i
knew
where
the
secret
party
was
i
like
to
go
and
tell
them
about
it
what
that
he
said
suddenly
turning
his
head
toward
the
street
what
are
they
calling
out
some
newsboy
with
a
particularly
shrill
voice
was
shouting
out
something
at
the
topmost
of
his
lungs
tense
and
excited
no
member
of
the
circle
stirred
or
spoke
for
a
few
seconds
the
rat
listened
marco
listened
the
whole
squad
listened
pricking
up
their
ears
startling
news
from
samavia
the
newsboy
was
shrilling
out
amazing
story
descendant
of
the
lost
prince
found
descendant
of
the
lost
prince
found
any
chap
got
a
penny
snapped
the
rat
beginning
to
shuffle
toward
the
arched
passage
i
have
answered
marco
following
him
come
on
the
rat
yelled
let
go
and
get
a
paper
and
he
whizzed
down
the
passage
with
his
swiftest
dart
while
the
squad
followed
him
shouting
and
tumbling
over
each
other
ix
it
is
not
a
game
loristan
walked
slowly
up
and
down
the
back
and
listened
to
marco
who
sat
by
the
small
fire
and
talked
go
on
he
said
whenever
the
boy
stopped
i
want
to
hear
it
all
a
strange
lad
and
it
a
splendid
game
marco
was
telling
him
the
story
of
his
second
and
third
visits
to
the
inclosure
behind
the
deserted
he
had
begun
at
the
beginning
and
his
father
had
listened
with
a
deep
interest
a
year
later
marco
recalled
this
evening
as
a
thrilling
memory
and
as
one
which
would
never
pass
away
from
him
throughout
his
life
he
would
always
be
able
to
call
it
all
back
the
small
and
dingy
back
room
the
dimness
of
the
one
poor
which
was
all
they
could
afford
to
light
the
iron
box
pushed
into
the
corner
with
its
maps
and
plans
locked
safely
in
it
the
erect
bearing
and
actual
beauty
of
the
tall
form
which
the
shabbiness
of
worn
and
mended
clothes
could
not
hide
or
dim
not
even
rags
and
tatters
could
have
made
loristan
seem
insignificant
or
undistinguished
he
was
always
the
same
his
eyes
seemed
darker
and
more
wonderful
than
ever
in
their
remote
thoughtfulness
and
interest
as
he
spoke
go
on
he
said
it
is
a
splendid
game
and
it
is
curious
he
has
thought
it
out
well
the
lad
is
a
born
soldier
it
is
not
a
game
to
him
marco
said
and
it
is
not
a
game
to
me
the
squad
is
only
playing
but
with
him
it
quite
different
he
knows
never
really
get
what
he
wants
but
he
feels
as
if
this
was
something
near
it
he
said
i
might
show
you
the
map
he
made
father
look
at
it
he
gave
loristan
the
clean
copy
of
the
rat
map
of
samavia
the
city
of
melzarr
was
marked
with
certain
signs
they
were
to
show
at
what
points
the
rat
if
he
had
been
a
samavian
general
would
have
attacked
the
capital
as
marco
pointed
them
out
he
explained
the
rat
reasons
for
his
planning
loristan
held
the
paper
for
some
minutes
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
it
curiously
and
his
black
brows
drew
themselves
together
this
is
very
wonderful
he
said
at
last
he
is
quite
right
they
might
have
got
in
there
and
for
the
very
reasons
he
hit
on
how
did
he
learn
all
this
he
thinks
of
nothing
else
now
answered
marco
he
has
always
thought
of
wars
and
made
plans
for
battles
he
not
like
the
rest
of
the
squad
his
father
is
nearly
always
drunk
but
he
is
very
well
educated
and
when
he
is
only
half
drunk
he
likes
to
talk
the
rat
asks
him
questions
then
and
leads
him
on
until
he
finds
out
a
great
deal
then
he
begs
old
newspapers
and
he
hides
himself
in
corners
and
listens
to
what
people
are
saying
he
says
he
lies
awake
at
night
thinking
it
out
and
he
thinks
about
it
all
the
day
that
was
why
he
got
up
the
squad
loristan
had
continued
examining
the
paper
tell
him
he
said
when
he
refolded
and
handed
it
back
that
i
studied
his
map
and
he
may
be
proud
of
it
you
may
also
tell
him
and
he
smiled
quietly
as
he
spoke
that
in
my
opinion
he
is
right
the
iarovitch
would
have
held
melzarr
if
he
had
led
them
marco
was
full
of
exultation
i
thought
you
would
say
he
was
right
i
felt
sure
you
would
that
is
what
makes
me
want
to
tell
you
the
rest
he
hurried
on
if
you
think
he
is
right
about
the
rest
too
he
stopped
awkwardly
because
of
a
sudden
wild
thought
which
rushed
upon
him
i
do
know
what
you
will
think
he
stammered
perhaps
it
will
seem
to
you
as
if
the
game
as
if
that
part
of
it
could
could
only
be
a
game
he
was
so
fervent
in
spite
of
his
hesitation
that
loristan
began
to
watch
him
with
sympathetic
respect
as
he
always
did
when
the
boy
was
trying
to
express
something
he
was
not
sure
of
one
of
the
great
bonds
between
them
was
that
loristan
was
always
interested
in
his
boyish
mental
processes
in
the
way
in
which
his
thoughts
led
him
to
any
conclusion
go
on
he
said
again
i
am
like
the
rat
and
i
am
like
you
it
has
not
seemed
quite
like
a
game
to
me
so
far
he
sat
down
at
the
and
marco
in
his
eagerness
drew
nearer
and
leaned
against
it
resting
on
his
arms
and
lowering
his
voice
though
it
was
always
their
habit
to
speak
at
such
a
pitch
that
no
one
outside
the
room
they
were
in
could
distinguish
what
they
said
it
is
the
rat
plan
for
giving
the
signal
for
a
rising
he
said
loristan
made
a
slight
movement
does
he
think
there
will
be
a
rising
he
asked
he
says
that
must
be
what
the
secret
party
has
been
preparing
for
all
these
years
and
it
must
come
soon
the
other
nations
see
that
the
fighting
must
be
put
an
end
to
even
if
they
have
to
stop
it
themselves
and
if
the
real
king
is
found
but
when
the
rat
bought
the
newspaper
there
was
nothing
in
it
about
where
he
was
it
was
only
a
sort
of
rumor
nobody
seemed
to
know
anything
he
stopped
a
few
seconds
but
he
did
not
utter
the
words
which
were
in
his
mind
he
did
not
say
but
know
and
the
rat
has
a
plan
for
giving
the
signal
loristan
said
marco
forgot
his
first
feeling
of
hesitation
he
began
to
see
the
plan
again
as
he
had
seen
it
when
the
rat
talked
he
began
to
speak
as
the
rat
had
spoken
forgetting
that
it
was
a
game
he
made
even
a
clearer
picture
than
the
rat
had
made
of
the
two
vagabond
boys
one
of
them
a
cripple
making
their
way
from
one
place
to
another
quite
free
to
carry
messages
or
warnings
where
they
chose
because
they
were
so
insignificant
and
that
no
one
could
think
of
them
as
anything
but
waifs
and
strays
belonging
to
nobody
and
blown
about
by
the
wind
of
poverty
and
chance
he
felt
as
if
he
wanted
to
convince
his
father
that
the
plan
was
a
possible
one
he
did
not
quite
know
why
he
felt
so
anxious
to
win
his
approval
of
the
scheme
as
if
it
were
real
as
if
it
could
actually
be
done
but
this
feeling
was
what
inspired
him
to
enter
into
new
details
and
suggest
possibilities
a
boy
who
was
a
cripple
and
one
who
was
only
a
street
singer
and
a
sort
of
beggar
could
get
almost
anywhere
he
said
soldiers
would
listen
to
a
singer
if
he
sang
good
songs
and
they
might
not
be
afraid
to
talk
before
him
a
strolling
singer
and
a
cripple
would
perhaps
hear
a
great
many
things
it
might
be
useful
for
the
secret
party
to
know
they
might
even
hear
important
things
do
you
think
so
before
he
had
gone
far
with
his
story
the
faraway
look
had
fallen
upon
loristan
face
the
look
marco
had
known
so
well
all
his
life
he
sat
turned
a
little
sidewise
from
the
boy
his
elbow
resting
on
the
table
and
his
forehead
on
his
hand
he
looked
down
at
the
worn
carpet
at
his
feet
and
so
he
looked
as
he
listened
to
the
end
it
was
as
if
some
new
thought
were
slowly
growing
in
his
mind
as
marco
went
on
talking
and
enlarging
on
the
rat
plan
he
did
not
even
look
up
or
change
his
position
as
he
answered
yes
i
think
so
but
because
of
the
deep
and
growing
thought
in
his
face
courage
increased
his
first
fear
that
this
part
of
the
planning
might
seem
so
bold
and
reckless
that
it
would
only
appear
to
belong
to
a
boyish
game
gradually
faded
away
for
some
strange
reason
his
father
had
said
that
the
first
part
of
the
rat
imaginings
had
not
seemed
quite
like
a
game
to
him
and
now
even
now
he
was
not
listening
as
if
he
were
listening
to
the
details
of
mere
exaggerated
fancies
it
was
as
if
the
thing
he
was
hearing
was
not
wildly
impossible
marco
knowledge
of
continental
countries
and
of
methods
of
journeying
helped
him
to
enter
into
much
detail
and
give
realism
to
his
plans
sometimes
we
could
pretend
we
knew
nothing
but
english
he
said
then
though
the
rat
could
not
understand
i
could
i
should
always
understand
in
each
country
i
know
the
cities
and
the
places
we
should
want
to
go
to
i
know
how
boys
like
us
live
and
so
we
should
not
do
anything
which
would
make
the
police
angry
or
make
people
notice
us
if
any
one
asked
questions
i
would
let
them
believe
that
i
had
met
the
rat
by
chance
and
we
had
made
up
our
minds
to
travel
together
because
people
gave
more
money
to
a
boy
who
sang
if
he
was
with
a
cripple
there
was
a
boy
who
used
to
play
the
guitar
in
the
streets
of
rome
and
he
always
had
a
lame
girl
with
him
and
every
one
knew
it
was
for
that
reason
when
he
played
people
looked
at
the
girl
and
were
sorry
for
her
and
gave
her
soldi
you
remember
yes
i
remember
and
what
you
say
is
true
loristan
answered
marco
leaned
forward
across
the
table
so
that
he
came
closer
to
him
the
tone
in
which
the
words
were
said
made
his
courage
leap
like
a
flame
to
be
allowed
to
go
on
with
this
boldness
was
to
feel
that
he
was
being
treated
almost
as
if
he
were
a
man
if
his
father
had
wished
to
stop
him
he
could
have
done
it
with
one
quiet
glance
without
uttering
a
word
for
some
wonderful
reason
he
did
not
wish
him
to
cease
talking
he
was
willing
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
he
was
even
interested
you
are
growing
older
he
had
said
the
night
he
had
revealed
the
marvelous
secret
silence
is
still
the
order
but
you
are
man
enough
to
be
told
more
was
he
man
enough
to
be
thought
worthy
to
help
samavia
in
any
small
way
even
with
boyish
fancies
which
might
contain
a
germ
of
some
thought
which
older
and
wiser
minds
might
make
useful
was
he
being
listened
to
because
the
plan
made
as
part
of
a
game
was
not
an
impossible
one
if
two
boys
who
could
be
trusted
could
be
found
he
caught
a
deep
breath
as
he
went
on
drawing
still
nearer
and
speaking
so
low
that
his
tone
was
almost
a
whisper
if
the
men
of
the
secret
party
have
been
working
and
thinking
for
so
many
years
they
have
prepared
everything
they
know
by
this
time
exactly
what
must
be
done
by
the
messengers
who
are
to
give
the
signal
they
can
tell
them
where
to
go
and
how
to
know
the
secret
friends
who
must
be
warned
if
the
orders
could
be
written
and
given
to
to
some
one
who
has
who
has
learned
to
remember
things
he
had
begun
to
breathe
so
quickly
that
he
stopped
for
a
moment
loristan
looked
up
he
looked
directly
into
his
eyes
some
one
who
has
been
to
remember
things
he
said
some
one
who
has
been
trained
marco
went
on
catching
his
breath
again
some
one
who
does
not
forget
who
would
never
forget
never
that
one
even
if
he
were
only
twelve
even
if
he
were
only
ten
could
go
and
do
as
he
was
told
loristan
put
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
comrade
he
said
you
are
speaking
as
if
you
were
ready
to
go
yourself
marco
eyes
looked
bravely
straight
into
his
but
he
said
not
one
word
do
you
know
what
it
would
mean
comrade
his
father
went
on
you
are
right
it
is
not
a
game
and
you
are
not
thinking
of
it
as
one
but
have
you
thought
how
it
would
be
if
something
betrayed
you
and
you
were
set
up
against
a
wall
to
be
marco
stood
up
quite
straight
he
tried
to
believe
he
felt
the
wall
against
his
back
if
i
were
shot
i
should
be
shot
for
samavia
he
said
and
for
father
even
as
he
was
speaking
the
front
rang
and
lazarus
evidently
opened
it
he
spoke
to
some
one
and
then
they
heard
his
footsteps
approaching
the
back
open
the
door
said
loristan
and
marco
opened
it
there
is
a
boy
who
is
a
cripple
here
sir
the
old
soldier
said
he
asked
to
see
master
marco
if
it
is
the
rat
said
loristan
bring
him
in
here
i
wish
to
see
him
marco
went
down
the
passage
to
the
front
door
the
rat
was
there
but
he
was
not
upon
his
platform
he
was
leaning
upon
an
old
pair
of
crutches
and
marco
thought
he
looked
wild
and
strange
he
was
white
and
somehow
the
lines
of
his
face
seemed
twisted
in
a
new
way
marco
wondered
if
something
had
frightened
him
or
if
he
felt
rat
he
began
my
father
i
come
to
tell
you
about
father
the
rat
broke
in
without
waiting
to
hear
the
rest
and
his
voice
was
as
strange
as
his
pale
face
i
do
know
why
i
come
but
i
i
just
wanted
to
he
dead
your
father
marco
stammered
he
he
dead
the
rat
answered
shakily
i
told
you
he
kill
himself
he
had
another
fit
and
he
died
in
it
i
knew
he
would
one
of
these
days
i
told
him
so
he
knew
he
would
himself
i
stayed
with
him
till
he
was
dead
and
then
i
got
a
bursting
headache
and
i
felt
sick
and
i
thought
about
you
marco
made
a
jump
at
him
because
he
saw
he
was
suddenly
shaking
as
if
he
were
going
to
fall
he
was
just
in
time
and
lazarus
who
had
been
looking
on
from
the
back
of
the
passage
came
forward
together
they
held
him
up
i
not
going
to
faint
he
said
weakly
but
i
felt
as
if
i
was
it
was
a
bad
fit
and
i
had
to
try
and
hold
him
i
was
all
by
myself
the
people
in
the
other
attic
thought
he
was
only
drunk
and
they
come
in
he
lying
on
the
floor
there
dead
come
and
see
my
father
marco
said
he
tell
us
what
do
do
lazarus
help
him
i
can
get
on
by
myself
said
the
rat
do
you
see
my
crutches
i
did
something
for
a
pawnbroker
last
night
and
he
gave
them
to
me
for
pay
but
though
he
tried
to
speak
carelessly
he
had
plainly
been
horribly
shaken
and
overwrought
his
queer
face
was
yellowish
white
still
and
he
was
trembling
a
little
marco
led
the
way
into
the
back
in
the
midst
of
its
shabby
gloom
and
under
the
dim
light
loristan
was
standing
in
one
of
his
still
attentive
attitudes
he
was
waiting
for
them
father
this
is
the
rat
the
boy
began
the
rat
stopped
short
and
rested
on
his
crutches
staring
at
the
tall
reposeful
figure
with
widened
eyes
is
that
your
father
he
said
to
marco
and
then
added
with
a
jerky
he
not
much
like
mine
is
he
x
the
rat
and
samavia
what
the
rat
thought
when
loristan
began
to
speak
to
him
marco
wondered
suddenly
he
stood
in
an
unknown
world
and
it
was
loristan
who
made
it
so
because
its
poverty
and
shabbiness
had
no
power
to
touch
him
he
looked
at
the
boy
with
calm
and
clear
eyes
he
asked
him
practical
questions
gently
and
it
was
plain
that
he
understood
many
things
without
asking
questions
at
all
marco
thought
that
perhaps
he
had
at
some
time
seen
drunken
men
die
in
his
life
in
strange
places
he
seemed
to
know
the
terribleness
of
the
night
through
which
the
rat
had
passed
he
made
him
sit
down
and
he
ordered
lazarus
to
bring
him
some
hot
coffee
and
simple
food
have
had
a
bite
since
yesterday
the
rat
said
still
staring
at
him
how
did
you
know
i
had
you
have
not
had
time
loristan
answered
afterward
he
made
him
lie
down
on
the
sofa
look
at
my
clothes
said
the
rat
lie
down
and
sleep
loristan
replied
putting
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
gently
forcing
him
toward
the
sofa
you
will
sleep
a
long
time
you
must
tell
me
how
to
find
the
place
where
your
father
died
and
i
will
see
that
the
proper
authorities
are
notified
what
are
you
doing
it
for
the
rat
asked
and
then
he
added
sir
because
i
am
a
man
and
you
are
a
boy
and
this
is
a
terrible
thing
loristan
answered
him
he
went
away
without
saying
more
and
the
rat
lay
on
the
sofa
staring
at
the
wall
and
thinking
about
it
until
he
fell
asleep
but
before
this
happened
marco
had
quietly
left
him
alone
so
as
loristan
had
told
him
he
would
he
slept
deeply
and
long
in
fact
he
slept
through
all
the
night
when
he
awakened
it
was
morning
and
lazarus
was
standing
by
the
side
of
the
sofa
looking
down
at
him
you
will
want
to
make
yourself
clean
he
said
it
must
be
done
clean
said
the
rat
with
his
squeaky
laugh
i
could
keep
clean
when
i
had
a
room
to
live
in
and
now
where
am
i
to
wash
myself
he
sat
up
and
looked
about
him
give
me
my
crutches
he
said
i
got
to
go
they
let
me
sleep
here
all
night
they
did
turn
me
into
the
street
i
do
know
why
they
did
marco
father
he
the
right
sort
he
looks
like
a
swell
the
master
said
lazarus
with
a
rigid
manner
the
master
is
a
great
gentleman
he
would
turn
no
tired
creature
into
the
street
he
and
his
son
are
poor
but
they
are
of
those
who
give
he
desires
to
see
and
talk
to
you
again
you
are
to
have
bread
and
coffee
with
him
and
the
young
master
but
it
is
i
who
tell
you
that
you
can
not
sit
at
table
with
them
until
you
are
clean
come
with
me
and
he
handed
him
his
crutches
his
manner
was
authoritative
but
it
was
the
manner
of
a
soldier
his
somewhat
stiff
and
erect
movements
were
those
of
a
soldier
also
and
the
rat
liked
them
because
they
made
him
feel
as
if
he
were
in
barracks
he
did
not
know
what
was
going
to
happen
but
he
got
up
and
followed
him
on
his
crutches
lazarus
took
him
to
a
closet
under
the
stairs
where
a
battered
tin
bath
was
already
full
of
hot
water
which
the
old
soldier
himself
had
brought
in
pails
there
were
soap
and
coarse
clean
towels
on
a
wooden
chair
and
also
there
was
a
much
worn
but
clean
suit
of
clothes
put
these
on
when
you
have
bathed
lazarus
ordered
pointing
to
them
they
belong
to
the
young
master
and
will
be
large
for
you
but
they
will
be
better
than
your
own
and
then
he
went
out
of
the
closet
and
shut
the
door
it
was
a
new
experience
for
the
rat
so
long
as
he
remembered
he
had
washed
his
face
and
hands
when
he
had
washed
them
at
all
at
an
iron
tap
set
in
the
wall
of
a
back
street
or
court
in
some
slum
his
father
and
himself
had
long
ago
sunk
into
the
world
where
to
wash
one
self
is
not
a
part
of
life
they
had
lived
amid
dirt
and
foulness
and
when
his
father
had
been
in
a
maudlin
state
he
had
sometimes
cried
and
talked
of
the
days
when
he
had
shaved
every
morning
and
put
on
a
clean
shirt
to
stand
even
in
the
most
battered
of
tin
baths
full
of
clean
hot
water
and
to
splash
and
scrub
with
a
big
piece
of
flannel
and
plenty
of
soap
was
a
marvelous
thing
the
rat
tired
body
responded
to
the
novelty
with
a
curious
feeling
of
freshness
and
comfort
i
dare
say
swells
do
this
every
day
he
muttered
i
do
it
myself
if
i
was
a
swell
soldiers
have
to
keep
themselves
so
clean
they
shine
when
after
making
the
most
of
his
soap
and
water
he
came
out
of
the
closet
under
the
stairs
he
was
as
fresh
as
marco
himself
and
though
his
clothes
had
been
built
for
a
more
stalwart
body
his
recognition
of
their
cleanliness
filled
him
with
pleasure
he
wondered
if
by
any
effort
he
could
keep
himself
clean
when
he
went
out
into
the
world
again
and
had
to
sleep
in
any
hole
the
police
did
not
order
him
out
of
he
wanted
to
see
marco
again
but
he
wanted
more
to
see
the
tall
man
with
the
soft
dark
eyes
and
that
queer
look
of
being
a
swell
in
spite
of
his
shabby
clothes
and
the
dingy
place
he
lived
in
there
was
something
about
him
which
made
you
keep
on
looking
at
him
and
wanting
to
know
what
he
was
thinking
of
and
why
you
felt
as
if
you
take
orders
from
him
as
you
take
orders
from
your
general
if
you
were
a
soldier
he
looked
somehow
like
a
soldier
but
as
if
he
were
something
more
as
if
people
had
taken
orders
from
him
all
his
life
and
always
would
take
orders
from
him
and
yet
he
had
that
quiet
voice
and
those
fine
easy
movements
and
he
was
not
a
soldier
at
all
but
only
a
poor
man
who
wrote
things
for
papers
which
did
not
pay
him
well
enough
to
give
him
and
his
son
a
comfortable
living
through
all
the
time
of
his
seclusion
with
the
battered
bath
and
the
soap
and
water
the
rat
thought
of
him
and
longed
to
have
another
look
at
him
and
hear
him
speak
again
he
did
not
see
any
reason
why
he
should
have
let
him
sleep
on
his
sofa
or
why
he
should
give
him
a
breakfast
before
he
turned
him
out
to
face
the
world
it
was
of
him
to
do
it
the
rat
felt
that
when
he
was
turned
out
after
he
had
had
the
coffee
he
should
want
to
hang
about
the
neighborhood
just
on
the
chance
of
seeing
him
pass
by
sometimes
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
going
to
do
the
parish
officials
would
by
this
time
have
taken
his
dead
father
and
he
would
not
see
him
again
he
did
not
want
to
see
him
again
he
had
never
seemed
like
a
father
they
had
never
cared
anything
for
each
other
he
had
only
been
a
wretched
outcast
whose
best
hours
had
been
when
he
had
drunk
too
much
to
be
violent
and
brutal
perhaps
the
rat
thought
he
would
be
driven
to
going
about
on
his
platform
on
the
pavements
and
begging
as
his
father
had
tried
to
force
him
to
do
could
he
sell
newspapers
what
could
a
crippled
lad
do
unless
he
begged
or
sold
papers
lazarus
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
passage
the
rat
held
back
a
little
perhaps
they
rather
not
eat
their
breakfast
with
me
he
hesitated
i
not
i
not
the
kind
they
are
i
could
swallow
the
coffee
out
here
and
carry
the
bread
away
with
me
and
you
could
thank
him
for
me
want
him
to
know
i
thanked
him
lazarus
also
had
a
steady
eye
the
rat
realized
that
he
was
looking
him
over
as
if
he
were
summing
him
up
you
may
not
be
the
kind
they
are
but
you
may
be
of
a
kind
the
master
sees
good
in
if
he
did
not
see
something
he
would
not
ask
you
to
sit
at
his
table
you
are
to
come
with
me
the
squad
had
seen
good
in
the
rat
but
no
one
else
had
policemen
had
moved
him
on
whenever
they
set
eyes
on
him
the
wretched
women
of
the
slums
had
regarded
him
as
they
regarded
his
darting
thieving
namesake
loafing
or
busy
men
had
seen
in
him
a
young
nuisance
to
be
kicked
or
pushed
out
of
the
way
the
squad
had
not
called
good
what
they
saw
in
him
they
would
have
yelled
with
laughter
if
they
had
heard
any
one
else
call
it
so
goodness
was
not
considered
an
attraction
in
their
world
the
rat
grinned
a
little
and
wondered
what
was
meant
as
he
followed
lazarus
into
the
back
it
was
as
dingy
and
gloomy
as
it
had
looked
the
night
before
but
by
the
daylight
the
rat
saw
how
rigidly
neat
it
was
how
well
swept
and
free
from
any
speck
of
dust
how
the
poor
windows
had
been
cleaned
and
polished
and
how
everything
was
set
in
order
the
coarse
linen
cloth
on
the
table
was
fresh
and
spotless
so
was
the
cheap
crockery
the
spoons
shone
with
brightness
loristan
was
standing
on
the
hearth
and
marco
was
near
him
they
were
waiting
for
their
vagabond
guest
as
if
he
had
been
a
gentleman
the
rat
hesitated
and
shuffled
at
the
door
for
a
moment
and
then
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
to
stand
as
straight
as
he
could
and
salute
when
he
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
loristan
he
felt
as
if
he
ought
to
do
something
but
he
did
not
know
what
loristan
recognition
of
his
gesture
and
his
expression
as
he
moved
forward
lifted
from
the
rat
shoulders
a
load
which
he
himself
had
not
known
lay
there
somehow
he
felt
as
if
something
new
had
happened
to
him
as
if
he
were
not
mere
vermin
after
all
as
if
he
need
not
be
on
the
defensive
even
as
if
he
need
not
feel
so
much
in
the
dark
and
like
a
thing
there
was
no
place
in
the
world
for
the
mere
straight
and
look
of
this
man
eyes
seemed
to
make
a
place
somewhere
for
what
he
looked
at
and
yet
what
he
said
was
quite
simple
this
is
well
he
said
you
have
rested
we
will
have
some
food
and
then
we
will
talk
together
he
made
a
slight
gesture
in
the
direction
of
the
chair
at
the
right
hand
of
his
own
place
the
rat
hesitated
again
what
a
swell
he
was
with
that
wave
of
the
hand
he
made
you
feel
as
if
you
were
a
fellow
like
himself
and
he
was
doing
you
some
honor
i
not
the
rat
broke
off
and
jerked
his
head
toward
marco
he
knows
he
ended
i
never
sat
at
a
table
like
this
before
there
is
not
much
on
it
loristan
made
the
slight
gesture
toward
the
seat
again
and
smiled
let
us
sit
down
the
rat
obeyed
him
and
the
meal
began
there
were
only
bread
and
coffee
and
a
little
butter
before
them
but
lazarus
presented
the
cups
and
plates
on
a
small
japanned
tray
as
if
it
were
a
golden
salver
when
he
was
not
serving
he
stood
upright
behind
his
master
chair
as
though
he
wore
royal
livery
of
scarlet
and
gold
to
the
boy
who
had
gnawed
a
bone
or
munched
a
crust
wheresoever
he
found
them
and
with
no
thought
but
of
the
appeasing
of
his
own
wolfish
hunger
to
watch
the
two
with
whom
he
sat
eat
their
simple
food
was
a
new
thing
he
knew
nothing
of
the
decencies
of
civilized
people
the
rat
liked
to
look
at
them
and
he
found
himself
trying
to
hold
his
cup
as
loristan
did
and
to
sit
and
move
as
marco
was
sitting
and
moving
taking
his
bread
or
butter
when
it
was
held
at
his
side
by
lazarus
as
if
it
were
a
simple
thing
to
be
waited
upon
marco
had
had
things
handed
to
him
all
his
life
and
it
did
not
make
him
feel
awkward
the
rat
knew
that
his
own
father
had
once
lived
like
this
he
himself
would
have
been
at
ease
if
chance
had
treated
him
fairly
it
made
him
scowl
to
think
of
it
but
in
a
few
minutes
loristan
began
to
talk
about
the
copy
of
the
map
of
samavia
then
the
rat
forgot
everything
else
and
was
ill
at
ease
no
more
he
did
not
know
that
loristan
was
leading
him
on
to
explain
his
theories
about
the
country
and
the
people
and
the
war
he
found
himself
telling
all
that
he
had
read
or
overheard
or
as
he
lay
awake
in
his
garret
he
had
thought
out
a
great
many
things
in
a
way
not
at
all
like
a
boy
his
strangely
concentrated
and
mind
had
been
full
of
military
schemes
which
loristan
listened
to
with
curiosity
and
also
with
amazement
he
had
become
extraordinarily
clever
in
one
direction
because
he
had
fixed
all
his
mental
powers
on
one
thing
it
seemed
scarcely
natural
that
an
untaught
vagabond
lad
should
know
so
much
and
reason
so
clearly
it
was
at
least
extraordinarily
interesting
there
had
been
no
skirmish
no
attack
no
battle
which
he
had
not
led
and
fought
in
his
own
imagination
and
he
had
made
scores
of
rough
queer
plans
of
all
that
had
been
or
should
have
been
done
lazarus
listened
as
attentively
as
his
master
and
once
marco
saw
him
exchange
a
startled
rapid
glance
with
loristan
it
was
at
a
moment
when
the
rat
was
sketching
with
his
finger
on
the
cloth
an
attack
which
to
have
been
made
but
was
not
and
marco
knew
at
once
that
the
quickly
exchanged
look
meant
he
is
right
if
it
had
been
done
there
would
have
been
victory
instead
of
disaster
it
was
a
wonderful
meal
though
it
was
only
of
bread
and
coffee
the
rat
knew
he
should
never
be
able
to
forget
it
afterward
loristan
told
him
of
what
he
had
done
the
night
before
he
had
seen
the
parish
authorities
and
all
had
been
done
which
a
city
government
provides
in
the
case
of
a
pauper
death
his
father
would
be
buried
in
the
usual
manner
we
will
follow
him
loristan
said
in
the
end
you
and
i
and
marco
and
lazarus
the
rat
mouth
fell
open
you
and
marco
and
lazarus
he
exclaimed
staring
and
me
why
should
any
of
us
go
i
do
want
to
he
would
have
followed
me
if
i
been
the
one
loristan
remained
silent
for
a
few
moments
when
a
life
has
counted
for
nothing
the
end
of
it
is
a
lonely
thing
he
said
at
last
if
it
has
forgotten
all
respect
for
itself
pity
is
all
that
one
has
left
to
give
one
would
like
to
give
to
anything
so
lonely
he
said
the
last
brief
sentence
after
a
pause
let
us
go
marco
said
suddenly
and
he
caught
the
rat
hand
the
rat
own
movement
was
sudden
he
slipped
from
his
crutches
to
a
chair
and
sat
and
gazed
at
the
worn
carpet
as
if
he
were
not
looking
at
it
at
all
but
at
something
a
long
way
off
after
a
while
he
looked
up
at
loristan
do
you
know
what
i
thought
of
all
at
once
he
said
in
a
shaky
voice
i
thought
of
that
prince
one
he
only
lived
once
perhaps
he
did
live
a
long
time
nobody
knows
but
it
five
hundred
years
ago
and
just
because
he
was
the
kind
he
was
every
one
that
remembers
him
thinks
of
something
fine
it
queer
but
it
does
you
good
just
to
hear
his
name
and
if
he
has
been
training
kings
for
samavia
all
these
centuries
they
may
have
been
poor
and
nobody
may
have
known
about
them
but
they
been
that
what
did
just
by
being
alive
a
few
years
when
i
think
of
him
and
then
think
of
the
other
there
such
an
awful
difference
that
yes
i
sorry
for
the
first
time
i
his
son
and
i
ca
care
about
him
but
he
too
lonely
i
want
to
go
so
it
was
that
when
the
forlorn
derelict
was
carried
to
the
graveyard
where
nameless
burdens
on
the
city
were
given
to
the
earth
a
curious
funeral
procession
followed
him
there
were
two
tall
and
soldierly
looking
men
and
two
boys
one
of
whom
walked
on
crutches
and
behind
them
were
ten
other
boys
who
walked
two
by
two
these
ten
were
a
queer
ragged
lot
but
they
had
respectfully
sober
faces
held
their
heads
and
their
shoulders
well
and
walked
with
a
remarkably
regular
marching
step
it
was
the
squad
but
they
had
left
their
rifles
at
home
xi
come
with
me
when
they
came
back
from
the
graveyard
the
rat
was
silent
all
the
way
he
was
thinking
of
what
had
happened
and
of
what
lay
before
him
he
was
in
fact
thinking
chiefly
that
nothing
lay
before
him
nothing
the
certainty
of
that
gave
his
sharp
lined
face
new
lines
and
sharpness
which
made
it
look
pinched
and
hard
he
had
nothing
before
but
a
corner
in
a
bare
garret
in
which
he
could
find
little
more
than
a
leaking
roof
over
his
head
when
he
was
not
turned
out
into
the
street
but
if
policemen
asked
him
where
he
lived
he
could
say
he
lived
in
bone
court
with
his
father
now
he
could
say
it
he
got
along
very
well
on
his
crutches
but
he
was
rather
tired
when
they
reached
the
turn
in
the
street
which
led
in
the
direction
of
his
old
haunts
at
any
rate
they
were
haunts
he
knew
and
he
belonged
to
them
more
than
he
belonged
elsewhere
the
squad
stopped
at
this
particular
corner
because
it
led
to
such
homes
as
they
possessed
they
stopped
in
a
body
and
looked
at
the
rat
and
the
rat
stopped
also
he
swung
himself
to
loristan
side
touching
his
hand
to
his
forehead
thank
you
sir
he
said
line
and
salute
you
chaps
and
the
squad
stood
in
line
and
raised
their
hands
also
thank
you
sir
thank
you
marco
where
are
you
going
loristan
asked
i
do
know
yet
the
rat
answered
biting
his
lips
he
and
loristan
looked
at
each
other
a
few
moments
in
silence
both
of
them
were
thinking
very
hard
in
the
rat
eyes
there
was
a
kind
of
desperate
adoration
he
did
not
know
what
he
should
do
when
this
man
turned
and
walked
away
from
him
it
would
be
as
if
the
sun
itself
had
dropped
out
of
the
heavens
and
the
rat
had
not
thought
of
what
the
sun
meant
before
but
loristan
did
not
turn
and
walk
away
he
looked
deep
into
the
eyes
as
if
he
were
searching
to
find
some
certainty
then
he
said
in
a
low
voice
you
know
how
poor
i
am
i
i
do
care
said
the
rat
you
you
like
a
king
to
me
stand
up
and
be
shot
to
bits
if
you
told
me
to
do
it
i
am
so
poor
that
i
am
not
sure
i
can
give
you
enough
dry
bread
to
eat
always
marco
and
lazarus
and
i
are
often
hungry
sometimes
you
might
have
nothing
to
sleep
on
but
the
floor
but
i
can
find
a
for
you
if
i
take
you
with
me
said
loristan
do
you
know
what
i
mean
by
a
yes
i
do
answered
the
rat
it
what
i
never
had
before
sir
what
he
knew
was
that
it
meant
some
bit
of
space
out
of
all
the
world
where
he
would
have
a
sort
of
right
to
stand
howsoever
poor
and
bare
it
might
be
i
not
used
to
beds
or
to
food
enough
he
said
but
he
did
not
dare
to
insist
too
much
on
that
place
it
seemed
too
great
a
thing
to
be
true
loristan
took
his
arm
come
with
me
he
said
we
wo
part
i
believe
you
are
to
be
trusted
the
rat
turned
quite
white
in
a
sort
of
anguish
of
joy
he
had
never
cared
for
any
one
in
his
life
he
had
been
a
sort
of
young
cain
his
hand
against
every
man
and
every
man
hand
against
him
and
during
the
last
twelve
hours
he
had
plunged
into
a
tumultuous
ocean
of
boyish
this
man
seemed
like
a
sort
of
god
to
him
what
he
had
said
and
done
the
day
before
in
what
had
been
really
the
rat
hours
of
extremity
after
that
appalling
night
the
way
he
had
looked
into
his
face
and
understood
it
all
the
talk
at
the
table
when
he
had
listened
to
him
seriously
comprehending
and
actually
respecting
his
plans
and
rough
maps
his
silent
companionship
as
they
followed
the
pauper
hearse
together
these
things
were
enough
to
make
the
lad
longingly
ready
to
be
any
sort
of
servant
or
slave
to
him
if
he
might
see
and
be
spoken
to
by
him
even
once
or
twice
a
day
the
squad
wore
a
look
of
dismay
for
a
moment
and
loristan
saw
it
i
am
going
to
take
your
captain
with
me
he
said
but
he
will
come
back
to
barracks
so
will
marco
will
yer
go
on
with
the
game
asked
cad
as
eager
spokesman
we
want
to
go
on
being
the
party
yes
i
go
on
the
rat
answered
i
wo
give
it
up
there
a
lot
in
the
papers
so
they
were
pacified
and
went
on
their
way
and
loristan
and
lazarus
and
marco
and
the
rat
went
on
theirs
also
queer
thing
is
the
rat
thought
as
they
walked
together
i
a
bit
afraid
to
speak
to
him
unless
he
speaks
to
me
first
never
felt
that
way
before
with
any
one
he
had
jeered
at
policemen
and
had
impudently
chaffed
swells
but
he
felt
a
sort
of
secret
awe
of
this
man
and
actually
liked
the
feeling
it
as
if
i
was
a
private
and
he
was
he
thought
that
it
loristan
talked
to
him
as
they
went
he
was
simple
enough
in
his
statements
of
the
situation
there
was
an
old
sofa
in
marco
bedroom
it
was
narrow
and
hard
as
marco
bed
itself
was
but
the
rat
could
sleep
upon
it
they
would
share
what
food
they
had
there
were
newspapers
and
magazines
to
be
read
there
were
papers
and
pencils
to
draw
new
maps
and
plans
of
battles
there
was
even
an
old
map
of
samavia
of
marco
which
the
two
boys
could
study
together
as
an
aid
to
their
game
the
rat
eyes
began
to
have
points
of
fire
in
them
if
i
could
see
the
papers
every
morning
i
could
fight
the
battles
on
paper
by
night
he
said
quite
panting
at
the
incredible
vision
of
splendor
were
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
going
to
be
given
to
him
was
he
going
to
sleep
without
a
drunken
father
near
him
was
he
going
to
have
a
chance
to
wash
himself
and
to
sit
at
a
table
and
hear
people
say
thank
you
and
i
beg
pardon
as
if
they
were
using
the
most
ordinary
fashion
of
speech
his
own
father
before
he
had
sunk
into
the
depths
had
lived
and
spoken
in
this
way
when
i
have
time
we
will
see
who
can
draw
up
the
best
plans
loristan
said
do
you
mean
that
you
look
at
mine
then
when
you
have
time
asked
the
rat
hesitatingly
i
was
expecting
that
yes
answered
loristan
i
look
at
them
and
we
talk
them
over
as
they
went
on
he
told
him
that
he
and
marco
could
do
many
things
together
they
could
go
to
museums
and
galleries
and
marco
could
show
him
what
he
himself
was
familiar
with
my
father
said
you
would
let
him
come
back
to
barracks
when
you
found
out
about
it
the
rat
said
hesitating
again
and
growing
hot
because
he
remembered
so
many
ugly
past
days
but
but
i
swear
i
do
him
any
harm
sir
i
wo
when
i
said
i
believed
you
could
be
trusted
i
meant
several
things
loristan
answered
him
that
was
one
of
them
you
a
new
recruit
you
and
marco
are
both
under
a
commanding
officer
he
said
the
words
because
he
knew
they
would
elate
him
and
stir
his
blood
xii
only
two
boys
the
words
did
elate
him
and
his
blood
was
stirred
by
them
every
time
they
returned
to
his
mind
he
remembered
them
through
the
days
and
nights
that
followed
he
sometimes
indeed
awakened
from
his
deep
sleep
on
the
hard
and
narrow
sofa
in
marco
room
and
found
that
he
was
saying
them
half
aloud
to
himself
the
hardness
of
the
sofa
did
not
prevent
his
resting
as
he
had
never
rested
before
in
his
life
by
contrast
with
the
past
he
had
known
this
poor
existence
was
comfort
which
verged
on
luxury
he
got
into
the
battered
tin
bath
every
morning
he
sat
at
the
clean
table
and
could
look
at
loristan
and
speak
to
him
and
hear
his
voice
his
chief
trouble
was
that
he
could
hardly
keep
his
eyes
off
him
and
he
was
a
little
afraid
he
might
be
annoyed
but
he
could
not
bear
to
lose
a
look
or
a
movement
at
the
end
of
the
second
day
he
found
his
way
at
some
trouble
to
lazarus
small
back
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
will
you
let
me
come
in
and
talk
a
bit
he
said
when
he
went
in
he
was
obliged
to
sit
on
the
top
of
lazarus
wooden
box
because
there
was
nothing
else
for
him
i
want
to
ask
you
he
plunged
into
his
talk
at
once
do
you
think
he
minds
me
looking
at
him
so
much
i
ca
help
it
but
if
he
hates
it
well
i
try
and
keep
my
eyes
on
the
table
the
master
is
used
to
being
looked
at
lazarus
made
answer
but
it
would
be
well
to
ask
himself
he
likes
open
speech
i
want
to
find
out
everything
he
likes
and
everything
he
does
like
the
rat
said
i
want
is
there
anything
anything
you
let
me
do
for
him
it
would
matter
what
it
was
and
he
need
know
you
are
not
doing
it
i
know
you
would
be
willing
to
give
up
anything
particular
but
you
wait
on
him
night
and
day
could
you
give
up
something
to
me
lazarus
pierced
him
with
keen
eyes
he
did
not
answer
for
several
seconds
now
and
then
he
said
gruffly
at
last
i
let
you
brush
his
boots
but
not
every
day
perhaps
once
a
week
when
will
you
let
me
have
my
first
turn
the
rat
asked
lazarus
reflected
his
shaggy
eyebrows
drew
themselves
down
over
his
eyes
as
if
this
were
a
question
of
state
next
saturday
he
conceded
not
before
i
tell
him
when
you
brush
them
you
need
said
the
rat
it
not
that
i
want
him
to
know
i
want
to
know
myself
that
i
doing
something
for
him
i
find
out
things
that
i
can
do
without
interfering
with
you
i
think
them
out
anything
any
one
else
did
for
him
would
be
interfering
with
me
said
lazarus
it
was
the
rat
turn
to
reflect
now
and
his
face
twisted
itself
into
new
lines
and
wrinkles
i
tell
you
before
i
do
anything
he
said
after
he
had
thought
it
over
you
served
him
first
i
have
served
him
ever
since
he
was
born
said
lazarus
he
he
yours
said
the
rat
still
thinking
deeply
i
am
his
was
lazarus
stern
answer
i
am
his
and
the
young
master
that
it
the
rat
said
then
a
squeak
of
a
broke
from
him
i
never
been
anybody
he
added
his
sharp
eyes
caught
a
passing
look
on
lazarus
face
such
a
queer
disturbed
sudden
look
could
he
be
rather
sorry
for
him
perhaps
the
look
meant
something
like
that
if
you
stay
near
him
long
enough
and
it
need
be
long
you
will
be
his
too
everybody
is
the
rat
sat
up
as
straight
as
he
could
when
it
comes
to
that
he
blurted
out
i
his
now
in
my
way
i
was
his
two
minutes
after
he
looked
at
me
with
his
queer
handsome
eyes
they
queer
because
they
get
you
and
you
want
to
follow
him
i
going
to
follow
that
night
lazarus
recounted
to
his
master
the
story
of
the
scene
he
simply
repeated
word
for
word
what
had
been
said
and
loristan
listened
gravely
we
have
not
had
time
to
learn
much
of
him
yet
he
commented
but
that
is
a
faithful
soul
i
think
a
few
days
later
marco
missed
the
rat
soon
after
their
breakfast
hour
he
had
gone
out
without
saying
anything
to
the
household
he
did
not
return
for
several
hours
and
when
he
came
back
he
looked
tired
in
the
afternoon
he
fell
asleep
on
his
sofa
in
marco
room
and
slept
heavily
no
one
asked
him
any
questions
as
he
volunteered
no
explanation
the
next
day
he
went
out
again
in
the
same
mysterious
manner
and
the
next
and
the
next
for
an
entire
week
he
went
out
and
returned
with
the
tired
look
but
he
did
not
explain
until
one
morning
as
he
lay
on
his
sofa
before
getting
up
he
said
to
marco
i
practicing
walking
with
my
crutches
i
do
want
to
go
about
like
a
rat
any
more
i
mean
to
be
as
near
like
other
people
as
i
can
i
walk
farther
every
morning
i
began
with
two
miles
if
i
practice
every
day
my
crutches
will
be
like
legs
shall
i
walk
with
you
asked
marco
would
you
mind
walking
with
a
cripple
do
call
yourself
that
said
marco
we
can
talk
together
and
try
to
remember
everything
we
see
as
we
go
along
i
want
to
learn
to
remember
things
i
like
to
train
myself
in
that
way
too
the
rat
answered
i
give
anything
to
know
some
of
the
things
your
father
taught
you
i
got
a
good
memory
i
remember
a
lot
of
things
i
do
want
to
remember
will
you
go
this
morning
that
morning
they
went
and
loristan
was
told
the
reason
for
their
walk
but
though
he
knew
one
reason
he
did
not
know
all
about
it
when
the
rat
was
allowed
his
turn
of
the
he
told
more
to
lazarus
what
i
want
to
do
he
said
is
not
only
walk
as
fast
as
other
people
do
but
faster
acrobats
train
themselves
to
do
anything
it
training
that
does
it
there
might
come
a
time
when
he
might
need
some
one
to
go
on
an
errand
quickly
and
i
going
to
be
ready
i
going
to
train
myself
until
he
need
think
of
me
as
if
i
were
only
a
cripple
who
ca
do
things
and
has
to
be
taken
care
of
i
want
him
to
know
that
really
as
strong
as
marco
and
where
marco
can
go
i
can
go
he
was
what
he
always
said
and
lazarus
always
understood
without
explanation
master
is
your
name
for
him
he
had
explained
at
the
beginning
and
i
ca
call
him
just
loristan
it
sounds
like
cheek
if
he
was
called
or
i
could
stand
it
though
it
would
be
quite
right
some
day
i
shall
find
a
name
when
i
speak
to
him
i
say
the
walks
were
taken
every
day
and
each
day
were
longer
marco
found
himself
silently
watching
the
rat
with
amazement
at
his
determination
and
endurance
he
knew
that
he
must
not
speak
of
what
he
could
not
fail
to
see
as
they
walked
he
must
not
tell
him
that
he
looked
tired
and
pale
and
sometimes
desperately
fatigued
he
had
inherited
from
his
father
the
tact
which
sees
what
people
do
not
wish
to
be
reminded
of
he
knew
that
for
some
reason
of
his
own
the
rat
had
determined
to
do
this
thing
at
any
cost
to
himself
sometimes
his
face
grew
white
and
worn
and
he
breathed
hard
but
he
never
rested
more
than
a
few
minutes
and
never
turned
back
or
shortened
a
walk
they
had
planned
tell
me
something
about
samavia
something
to
remember
he
would
say
when
he
looked
his
worst
when
i
begin
to
try
to
remember
i
forget
other
things
so
as
they
went
on
their
way
they
talked
and
the
rat
committed
things
to
memory
he
was
quick
at
it
and
grew
quicker
every
day
they
invented
a
game
of
remembering
faces
they
passed
both
would
learn
them
by
heart
and
on
their
return
home
marco
would
draw
them
they
went
to
the
museums
and
galleries
and
learned
things
there
making
from
memory
lists
and
descriptions
which
at
night
they
showed
to
loristan
when
he
was
not
too
busy
to
talk
to
them
as
the
days
passed
marco
saw
that
the
rat
was
gaining
strength
this
exhilarated
him
greatly
they
often
went
to
hampstead
heath
and
walked
in
the
wind
and
sun
there
the
rat
would
go
through
curious
exercises
which
he
believed
would
develop
his
muscles
he
began
to
look
less
tired
during
and
after
his
journey
there
were
even
fewer
wrinkles
on
his
face
and
his
sharp
eyes
looked
less
fierce
the
talks
between
the
two
boys
were
long
and
curious
marco
soon
realized
that
the
rat
wanted
to
learn
learn
learn
your
father
can
talk
to
you
almost
as
if
you
were
twenty
years
old
he
said
once
he
knows
you
can
understand
what
he
saying
if
he
were
to
talk
to
me
he
always
have
to
remember
that
i
was
only
a
rat
that
had
lived
in
gutters
and
seen
nothing
else
they
were
talking
in
their
room
as
they
nearly
always
did
after
they
went
to
bed
and
the
street
lamp
shone
in
and
lighted
their
bare
little
room
they
often
sat
up
clasping
their
knees
marco
on
his
poor
bed
the
rat
on
his
hard
sofa
but
neither
of
them
conscious
either
of
the
poorness
or
hardness
because
to
each
one
the
long
unknown
sense
of
companionship
was
such
a
satisfying
thing
neither
of
them
had
ever
talked
intimately
to
another
boy
and
now
they
were
together
day
and
night
they
revealed
their
thoughts
to
each
other
they
told
each
other
things
it
had
never
before
occurred
to
either
to
think
of
telling
any
one
in
fact
they
found
out
about
themselves
as
they
talked
things
they
had
not
quite
known
before
marco
had
gradually
discovered
that
the
admiration
the
rat
had
for
his
father
was
an
impassioned
and
curious
feeling
which
possessed
him
entirely
it
seemed
to
marco
that
it
was
beginning
to
be
like
a
sort
of
religion
he
evidently
thought
of
him
every
moment
so
when
he
spoke
of
loristan
knowing
him
to
be
only
a
rat
of
the
gutter
marco
felt
he
himself
was
fortunate
in
remembering
something
he
could
say
my
father
said
yesterday
that
you
had
a
big
brain
and
a
strong
will
he
answered
from
his
bed
he
said
that
you
had
a
wonderful
memory
which
only
needed
exercising
he
said
it
after
he
looked
over
the
list
you
made
of
the
things
you
had
seen
in
the
tower
the
rat
shuffled
on
his
sofa
and
clasped
his
knees
tighter
did
he
did
he
he
said
he
rested
his
chin
upon
his
knees
for
a
few
minutes
and
stared
straight
before
him
then
he
turned
to
the
bed
marco
he
said
in
a
rather
hoarse
voice
a
queer
voice
are
you
jealous
jealous
said
marco
why
i
mean
have
you
ever
been
jealous
do
you
know
what
it
is
like
i
do
think
i
do
answered
marco
staring
a
little
are
you
ever
jealous
of
lazarus
because
he
always
with
your
father
because
he
with
him
oftener
than
you
are
and
knows
about
his
work
and
can
do
things
for
him
you
ca
i
mean
are
you
jealous
of
your
father
marco
loosed
his
arms
from
his
knees
and
lay
down
flat
on
his
pillow
no
i
not
the
more
people
love
and
serve
him
the
better
he
said
the
only
thing
i
care
for
is
is
him
i
just
care
for
lazarus
does
too
do
you
the
rat
was
greatly
excited
internally
he
had
been
thinking
of
this
thing
a
great
deal
the
thought
had
sometimes
terrified
him
he
might
as
well
have
it
out
now
if
he
could
if
he
could
get
at
the
truth
everything
would
be
easier
but
would
marco
really
tell
him
do
you
mind
he
said
still
hoarse
and
eager
do
you
mind
how
much
i
care
for
him
could
it
ever
make
you
feel
savage
could
it
ever
set
you
thinking
i
was
nothing
but
what
i
am
and
that
it
was
cheek
of
me
to
push
myself
in
and
fasten
on
to
a
gentleman
who
only
took
me
up
for
charity
here
the
living
truth
he
ended
in
an
outburst
if
i
were
you
and
you
were
me
that
what
i
should
be
thinking
i
know
it
is
i
could
help
it
i
should
see
every
low
thing
there
was
in
you
in
your
manners
and
your
voice
and
your
looks
i
should
see
nothing
but
the
contrast
between
you
and
me
and
between
you
and
him
i
should
be
so
jealous
that
i
should
just
rage
i
should
you
and
i
should
you
he
had
wrought
himself
up
to
such
a
passion
of
feeling
that
he
set
marco
thinking
that
what
he
was
hearing
meant
strange
and
strong
emotions
such
as
he
himself
had
never
experienced
the
rat
had
been
thinking
over
all
this
in
secret
for
some
time
it
was
evident
marco
lay
still
a
few
minutes
and
thought
it
over
then
he
found
something
to
say
just
as
he
had
found
something
before
you
might
if
you
were
with
other
people
who
thought
in
the
same
way
he
said
and
if
you
had
found
out
that
it
is
such
a
mistake
to
think
in
that
way
that
it
even
stupid
but
you
see
if
you
were
i
you
would
have
lived
with
my
father
and
he
have
told
you
what
he
knows
what
he
been
finding
out
all
his
life
what
he
found
out
oh
marco
answered
quite
casually
just
that
you
ca
set
savage
thoughts
loose
in
the
world
any
more
than
you
can
let
loose
savage
beasts
with
hydrophobia
they
spread
a
sort
of
rabies
and
they
always
tear
and
worry
you
first
of
all
what
do
you
mean
the
rat
gasped
out
it
like
this
said
marco
lying
flat
and
cool
on
his
hard
pillow
and
looking
at
the
reflection
of
the
street
lamp
on
the
ceiling
that
day
i
turned
into
your
barracks
without
knowing
that
you
think
i
was
spying
it
made
you
feel
savage
and
you
threw
the
stone
at
me
if
it
had
made
me
feel
savage
and
i
rushed
in
and
fought
what
would
have
happened
to
all
of
us
the
rat
spirit
of
generalship
gave
the
answer
i
should
have
called
on
the
squad
to
charge
with
fixed
bayonets
have
half
killed
you
you
a
strong
chap
and
you
have
hurt
a
lot
of
them
a
note
of
terror
broke
into
his
voice
what
a
fool
i
should
have
been
he
cried
out
i
should
never
have
come
here
i
should
never
have
known
even
by
the
light
of
the
street
lamp
marco
could
see
him
begin
to
look
almost
ghastly
the
squad
could
easily
have
half
killed
me
marco
added
they
could
have
quite
killed
me
if
they
had
wanted
to
do
it
and
who
would
have
got
any
good
out
of
it
it
would
only
have
been
a
row
with
the
police
and
prison
at
the
end
of
it
but
because
you
lived
with
him
the
rat
pondered
you
walked
in
as
if
you
did
mind
and
just
asked
why
we
did
it
and
looked
like
a
stronger
chap
than
any
of
us
and
different
different
i
wondered
what
was
the
matter
with
you
you
were
so
cool
and
steady
i
know
now
it
was
because
you
were
like
him
he
taught
you
he
like
a
wizard
he
knows
things
that
wizards
think
they
know
but
he
knows
them
better
marco
said
he
says
they
not
queer
and
unnatural
just
simple
laws
of
nature
you
have
to
be
either
on
one
side
or
the
other
like
an
army
you
choose
your
side
you
either
build
up
or
tear
down
you
either
keep
in
the
light
where
you
can
see
or
you
stand
in
the
dark
and
fight
everything
that
comes
near
you
because
you
ca
see
and
you
think
it
an
enemy
no
you
would
have
been
jealous
if
been
i
and
i
been
you
and
you
the
rat
sharp
voice
was
almost
hollow
you
swear
you
not
i
not
said
marco
the
rat
excitement
even
increased
a
shade
as
he
poured
forth
his
confession
i
was
afraid
he
said
i
been
afraid
every
day
since
i
came
here
i
tell
you
straight
out
it
seemed
just
natural
that
you
and
lazarus
would
stand
me
just
as
i
would
have
stood
you
it
seemed
just
natural
that
you
work
together
to
throw
me
out
i
knew
how
i
should
have
worked
myself
marco
i
said
i
tell
you
straight
out
i
jealous
of
you
i
jealous
of
lazarus
it
makes
me
wild
when
i
see
you
both
knowing
all
about
him
and
fit
and
ready
to
do
anything
he
wants
done
i
not
ready
and
i
not
fit
you
do
anything
he
wanted
done
whether
you
were
fit
and
ready
or
not
said
marco
he
knows
that
does
he
do
you
think
he
does
cried
the
rat
i
wish
he
try
me
i
wish
he
would
marco
turned
over
on
his
bed
and
rose
up
on
his
elbow
so
that
he
faced
the
rat
on
his
sofa
let
us
he
said
in
a
whisper
let
us
there
was
a
pause
and
then
the
rat
whispered
also
for
what
for
him
to
find
out
that
we
fit
to
be
tried
do
you
see
what
fools
we
should
be
if
we
spent
our
time
in
being
jealous
either
of
us
we
only
two
boys
suppose
he
saw
we
were
only
two
silly
fools
when
you
are
jealous
of
me
or
of
lazarus
just
go
and
sit
down
in
a
still
place
and
think
of
do
think
about
yourself
or
about
us
he
so
quiet
that
to
think
about
him
makes
you
quiet
yourself
when
things
go
wrong
or
when
i
lonely
he
taught
me
to
sit
down
and
make
myself
think
of
things
i
like
pictures
books
monuments
splendid
places
it
pushes
the
other
things
out
and
sets
your
mind
going
properly
he
does
know
i
nearly
always
think
of
him
he
the
best
thought
himself
you
try
it
you
not
really
jealous
you
only
you
are
you
find
that
out
if
you
always
stop
yourself
in
time
any
one
can
be
such
a
fool
if
he
lets
himself
and
he
can
always
stop
it
if
he
makes
up
his
mind
i
not
jealous
you
must
let
that
thought
alone
you
not
jealous
yourself
kick
that
thought
into
the
street
the
rat
caught
his
breath
and
threw
his
arms
up
over
his
eyes
oh
lord
oh
lord
he
said
if
i
lived
near
him
always
as
you
have
if
i
just
had
we
both
living
near
him
now
said
marco
and
here
something
to
think
of
leaning
more
forward
on
his
elbow
the
kings
who
were
being
made
ready
for
samavia
have
waited
all
these
years
can
make
ourselves
ready
and
wait
so
that
if
just
two
boys
are
wanted
to
do
something
just
two
boys
we
can
step
out
of
the
ranks
when
the
call
comes
and
say
now
let
lie
down
and
think
of
it
until
we
go
to
sleep
xiii
loristan
attends
a
drill
of
the
squad
and
marco
meets
a
samavian
the
squad
was
not
forgotten
it
found
that
loristan
himself
would
have
regarded
neglect
as
a
breach
of
military
duty
you
must
remember
your
men
he
said
two
or
three
days
after
the
rat
became
a
member
of
his
household
you
must
keep
up
their
drill
marco
tells
me
it
was
very
smart
do
let
them
get
slack
his
men
the
rat
felt
what
he
could
not
have
put
into
words
he
knew
he
had
worked
and
that
the
squad
had
worked
in
their
hidden
holes
and
corners
only
hidden
holes
and
corners
had
been
possible
for
them
because
they
had
existed
in
spite
of
the
protest
of
their
world
and
the
vigilance
of
its
policemen
they
had
tried
many
refuges
before
they
found
the
barracks
no
one
but
resented
the
existence
of
a
troop
of
noisy
vagabonds
but
somehow
this
man
knew
that
there
had
evolved
from
it
something
more
than
mere
noisy
play
that
he
the
rat
had
order
and
discipline
his
men
it
made
him
feel
as
if
he
had
had
the
victoria
cross
fastened
on
his
coat
he
had
brain
enough
to
see
many
things
and
he
knew
that
it
was
in
this
way
that
loristan
was
finding
him
his
place
he
knew
how
when
they
went
to
the
barracks
the
squad
greeted
them
with
a
tumultuous
welcome
which
expressed
a
great
sense
of
relief
privately
the
members
had
been
filled
with
fears
which
they
had
talked
over
together
in
deep
gloom
marco
father
they
decided
was
too
big
a
swell
to
let
the
two
come
back
after
he
had
seen
the
sort
the
squad
was
made
up
of
he
might
be
poor
just
now
toffs
sometimes
lost
their
money
for
a
bit
but
you
could
see
what
he
was
and
fathers
like
him
were
going
to
let
their
sons
make
friends
with
such
as
us
he
stop
the
drill
and
the
secret
society
game
that
what
he
do
but
the
rat
came
swinging
in
on
his
secondhand
crutches
looking
as
if
he
had
been
made
a
general
and
marco
came
with
him
and
the
drill
the
squad
was
put
through
was
stricter
and
finer
than
any
drill
they
had
ever
known
i
wish
my
father
could
have
seen
that
marco
said
to
the
rat
the
rat
turned
red
and
white
and
then
red
again
but
he
said
not
a
single
word
the
mere
thought
was
like
a
flash
of
fire
passing
through
him
but
no
fellow
could
hope
for
a
thing
as
big
as
that
the
secret
party
in
its
subterranean
cavern
surrounded
by
its
piled
arms
sat
down
to
read
the
morning
paper
the
war
news
was
bad
to
read
the
maranovitch
held
the
day
for
the
moment
and
while
they
suffered
and
wrought
cruelties
in
the
capital
city
the
iarovitch
suffered
and
wrought
cruelties
in
the
country
outside
so
fierce
and
dark
was
the
record
that
europe
stood
aghast
the
rat
folded
his
paper
when
he
had
finished
and
sat
biting
his
nails
having
done
this
for
a
few
minutes
he
began
to
speak
in
his
dramatic
and
hollow
secret
party
whisper
the
hour
has
come
he
said
to
his
followers
the
messengers
must
go
forth
they
know
nothing
of
what
they
go
for
they
only
know
that
they
must
obey
if
they
were
caught
and
tortured
they
could
betray
nothing
because
they
know
nothing
but
that
at
certain
places
they
must
utter
a
certain
word
they
carry
no
papers
all
commands
they
must
learn
by
heart
when
the
sign
is
given
the
secret
party
will
know
what
to
do
where
to
meet
and
where
to
attack
he
drew
plans
of
the
battle
on
the
flagstones
and
he
sketched
an
imaginary
route
which
the
two
messengers
were
to
follow
but
his
knowledge
of
the
map
of
europe
was
not
worth
much
and
he
turned
to
marco
you
know
more
about
geography
that
i
do
you
know
more
about
everything
he
said
i
only
know
italy
is
at
the
bottom
and
russia
is
at
one
side
and
england
at
the
other
how
would
the
secret
messengers
go
to
samavia
can
you
draw
the
countries
they
have
to
pass
through
because
any
who
knew
the
map
could
have
done
the
same
thing
marco
drew
them
he
also
knew
the
stations
the
secret
two
would
arrive
at
and
leave
by
when
they
entered
a
city
the
streets
they
would
walk
through
and
the
very
uniforms
they
would
see
but
of
these
things
he
said
nothing
the
reality
his
knowledge
gave
to
the
game
was
however
a
thrilling
thing
he
wished
he
could
have
been
free
to
explain
to
the
rat
the
things
he
knew
together
they
could
have
worked
out
so
many
details
of
travel
and
possible
adventure
that
it
would
have
been
almost
as
if
they
had
set
out
on
their
journey
in
fact
as
it
was
the
mere
sketching
of
the
route
fired
the
rat
imagination
he
forged
ahead
with
the
story
of
adventure
and
filled
it
with
such
mysterious
purport
and
design
that
the
squad
at
times
gasped
for
breath
in
his
glowing
version
the
secret
two
entered
cities
by
midnight
and
sang
and
begged
at
palace
gates
where
kings
driving
outward
paused
to
listen
and
were
given
the
sign
though
it
would
not
always
be
kings
he
said
sometimes
it
would
be
the
poorest
people
sometimes
they
might
seem
to
be
beggars
like
ourselves
when
they
were
only
secret
ones
disguised
a
great
lord
might
wear
poor
clothes
and
pretend
to
be
a
workman
and
we
should
only
know
him
by
the
signs
we
had
learned
by
heart
when
we
were
sent
to
samavia
we
should
be
obliged
to
creep
in
through
some
back
part
of
the
country
where
no
fighting
was
being
done
and
where
no
one
would
attack
their
generals
are
not
clever
enough
to
protect
the
parts
which
are
joined
to
friendly
countries
and
they
have
not
forces
enough
two
boys
could
find
a
way
in
if
they
thought
it
out
he
became
possessed
by
the
idea
of
thinking
it
out
on
the
spot
he
drew
his
rough
map
of
samavia
on
the
flagstones
with
his
chalk
look
here
he
said
to
marco
who
with
the
elated
and
thrilled
squad
bent
over
it
in
a
close
circle
of
heads
beltrazo
is
here
and
carnolitz
is
here
and
here
is
jiardasia
beltrazo
and
jiardasia
are
friendly
though
they
do
take
sides
all
the
fighting
is
going
on
in
the
country
about
melzarr
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
prevent
single
travelers
from
coming
in
across
the
frontiers
of
friendly
neighbors
they
not
fighting
with
the
countries
outside
they
are
fighting
with
themselves
he
paused
a
moment
and
thought
the
article
in
that
magazine
said
something
about
a
huge
forest
on
the
eastern
frontier
that
here
we
could
wander
into
a
forest
and
stay
there
until
we
planned
all
we
wanted
to
do
even
the
people
who
had
seen
us
would
forget
about
us
what
we
have
to
do
is
to
make
people
feel
as
if
we
were
nothing
nothing
they
were
in
the
very
midst
of
it
crowded
together
leaning
over
stretching
necks
and
breathing
quickly
with
excitement
when
marco
lifted
his
head
some
mysterious
impulse
made
him
do
it
in
spite
of
himself
there
my
father
he
said
the
chalk
dropped
everything
dropped
even
samavia
the
rat
was
up
and
on
his
crutches
as
if
some
magic
force
had
swung
him
there
how
he
gave
the
command
or
if
he
gave
it
at
all
not
even
he
himself
knew
but
the
squad
stood
at
salute
loristan
was
standing
at
the
opening
of
the
archway
as
marco
had
stood
that
first
day
he
raised
his
right
hand
in
return
salute
and
came
forward
i
was
passing
the
end
of
the
street
and
remembered
the
barracks
was
here
he
explained
i
thought
i
should
like
to
look
at
your
men
captain
he
smiled
but
it
was
not
a
smile
which
made
his
words
really
a
joke
he
looked
down
at
the
chalk
map
drawn
on
the
flagstones
you
know
that
map
well
he
said
even
i
can
see
that
it
is
samavia
what
is
the
secret
party
doing
the
messengers
are
trying
to
find
a
way
in
answered
marco
we
can
get
in
there
said
the
rat
pointing
with
a
crutch
there
a
forest
where
we
could
hide
and
find
out
things
reconnoiter
said
loristan
looking
down
yes
two
stray
boys
could
be
very
safe
in
a
forest
it
a
good
game
that
he
should
be
there
that
he
should
in
his
own
wonderful
way
have
given
them
such
a
thing
as
this
that
he
should
have
cared
enough
even
to
look
up
the
barracks
was
what
the
rat
was
thinking
a
batch
of
ragamuffins
they
were
and
nothing
else
and
he
standing
looking
at
them
with
his
fine
smile
there
was
something
about
him
which
made
him
seem
even
splendid
the
rat
heart
thumped
with
startled
joy
father
said
marco
will
you
watch
the
rat
drill
us
i
want
you
to
see
how
well
it
is
done
captain
will
you
do
me
that
honor
loristan
said
to
the
rat
and
to
even
these
words
he
gave
the
right
tone
neither
jesting
nor
too
serious
because
it
was
so
right
a
tone
the
rat
pulses
beat
only
with
exultation
this
god
of
his
had
looked
at
his
maps
he
had
talked
of
his
plans
he
had
come
to
see
the
soldiers
who
were
his
work
the
rat
began
his
drill
as
if
he
had
been
reviewing
an
army
what
loristan
saw
done
was
wonderful
in
its
mechanical
exactness
the
squad
moved
like
the
perfect
parts
of
a
perfect
machine
that
they
could
so
do
it
in
such
space
and
that
they
should
have
accomplished
such
precision
was
an
extraordinary
testimonial
to
the
military
efficiency
and
curious
qualities
of
this
one
hunchbacked
vagabond
officer
that
is
magnificent
the
spectator
said
when
it
was
over
it
could
not
be
better
done
allow
me
to
congratulate
you
he
shook
the
rat
hand
as
if
it
had
been
a
man
and
after
he
had
shaken
it
he
put
his
own
hand
lightly
on
the
boy
shoulder
and
let
it
rest
there
as
he
talked
a
few
minutes
to
them
all
he
kept
his
talk
within
the
game
and
his
clear
comprehension
of
it
added
a
flavor
which
even
the
dullest
member
of
the
squad
was
elated
by
sometimes
you
could
understand
toffs
when
they
made
a
shy
at
being
friendly
but
you
could
understand
him
and
he
stirred
up
your
spirits
he
did
make
jokes
with
you
either
as
if
a
chap
had
to
be
kept
grinning
after
the
few
minutes
were
over
he
went
away
then
they
sat
down
again
in
their
circle
and
talked
about
him
because
they
could
talk
and
think
about
nothing
else
they
stared
at
marco
furtively
feeling
as
if
he
were
a
creature
of
another
world
because
he
had
lived
with
this
man
they
stared
at
the
rat
in
a
new
way
also
the
hand
had
rested
on
his
shoulder
and
he
had
been
told
that
what
he
had
done
was
magnificent
when
you
said
you
wished
your
father
could
have
seen
the
drill
said
the
rat
you
took
my
breath
away
i
never
have
had
the
cheek
to
think
of
it
myself
and
i
never
have
dared
to
let
you
ask
him
even
if
you
wanted
to
do
it
and
he
came
himself
it
struck
me
dumb
if
he
came
said
marco
it
was
because
he
wanted
to
see
it
when
they
had
finished
talking
it
was
time
for
marco
and
the
rat
to
go
on
their
way
loristan
had
given
the
rat
an
errand
at
a
certain
hour
he
was
to
present
himself
at
a
certain
shop
and
receive
a
package
let
him
do
it
alone
loristan
said
to
marco
he
will
be
better
pleased
his
desire
is
to
feel
that
he
is
trusted
to
do
things
alone
so
they
parted
at
a
street
corner
marco
to
walk
back
to
no
philibert
place
the
rat
to
execute
his
commission
marco
turned
into
one
of
the
better
streets
through
which
he
often
passed
on
his
way
home
it
was
not
a
fashionable
quarter
but
it
contained
some
respectable
houses
in
whose
windows
here
and
there
were
to
be
seen
neat
cards
bearing
the
word
apartments
which
meant
that
the
owner
of
the
house
would
let
to
lodgers
his
or
suite
as
marco
walked
up
the
street
he
saw
some
one
come
out
of
the
door
of
one
of
the
houses
and
walk
quickly
and
lightly
down
the
pavement
it
was
a
young
woman
wearing
an
elegant
though
quiet
dress
and
a
hat
which
looked
as
if
it
had
been
bought
in
paris
or
vienna
she
had
in
fact
a
slightly
foreign
air
and
it
was
this
indeed
which
made
marco
look
at
her
long
enough
to
see
that
she
was
also
a
graceful
and
lovely
person
he
wondered
what
her
nationality
was
even
at
some
yards
distance
he
could
see
that
she
had
long
dark
eyes
and
a
curved
mouth
which
seemed
to
be
smiling
to
itself
he
thought
she
might
be
spanish
or
italian
he
was
trying
to
decide
which
of
the
two
countries
she
belonged
to
as
she
drew
near
to
him
but
quite
suddenly
the
curved
mouth
ceased
smiling
as
her
foot
seemed
to
catch
in
a
break
in
the
pavement
and
she
so
lost
her
balance
that
she
would
have
fallen
if
he
had
not
leaped
forward
and
caught
her
she
was
light
and
slender
and
he
was
a
strong
lad
and
managed
to
steady
her
an
expression
of
sharp
momentary
anguish
crossed
her
face
i
hope
you
are
not
hurt
marco
said
she
bit
her
lip
and
clutched
his
shoulder
very
hard
with
her
slim
hand
i
have
twisted
my
ankle
she
answered
i
am
afraid
i
have
twisted
it
badly
thank
you
for
saving
me
i
should
have
had
a
bad
fall
her
long
dark
eyes
were
very
sweet
and
grateful
she
tried
to
smile
but
there
was
such
distress
under
the
effort
that
marco
was
afraid
she
must
have
hurt
herself
very
much
can
you
stand
on
your
foot
at
all
he
asked
i
can
stand
a
little
now
she
said
but
i
might
not
be
able
to
stand
in
a
few
minutes
i
must
get
back
to
the
house
while
i
can
bear
to
touch
the
ground
with
it
i
am
so
sorry
i
am
afraid
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
to
go
with
me
fortunately
it
is
only
a
few
yards
away
yes
marco
answered
i
saw
you
come
out
of
the
house
if
you
will
lean
on
my
shoulder
i
can
soon
help
you
back
i
am
glad
to
do
it
shall
we
try
now
she
had
a
gentle
and
soft
manner
which
would
have
appealed
to
any
boy
her
voice
was
musical
and
her
enunciation
exquisite
whether
she
was
spanish
or
italian
it
was
easy
to
imagine
her
a
person
who
did
not
always
live
in
london
lodgings
even
of
the
better
class
if
you
please
she
answered
him
it
is
very
kind
of
you
you
are
very
strong
i
see
but
i
am
glad
to
have
only
a
few
steps
to
go
she
rested
on
his
shoulder
as
well
as
on
her
umbrella
but
it
was
plain
that
every
movement
gave
her
intense
pain
she
caught
her
lip
with
her
teeth
and
marco
thought
she
turned
white
he
could
not
help
liking
her
she
was
so
lovely
and
gracious
and
brave
he
could
not
bear
to
see
the
suffering
in
her
face
i
am
so
sorry
he
said
as
he
helped
her
and
his
boy
voice
had
something
of
the
wonderful
sympathetic
tone
of
loristan
the
beautiful
lady
herself
remarked
it
and
thought
how
unlike
it
was
to
the
ordinary
i
have
a
she
said
when
they
stood
on
the
low
step
she
found
the
in
her
purse
and
opened
the
door
marco
helped
her
into
the
she
sat
down
at
once
in
a
chair
near
the
the
place
was
quite
plain
and
inside
shall
i
ring
the
bell
to
call
some
one
marco
inquired
i
am
afraid
that
the
servants
are
out
she
answered
they
had
a
holiday
will
you
kindly
close
the
door
i
shall
be
obliged
to
ask
you
to
help
me
into
the
at
the
end
of
the
hall
i
shall
find
all
i
want
there
if
you
will
kindly
hand
me
a
few
things
some
one
may
come
in
presently
perhaps
one
of
the
other
lodgers
and
even
if
i
am
alone
for
an
hour
or
so
it
will
not
really
matter
perhaps
i
can
find
the
landlady
marco
suggested
the
beautiful
person
smiled
she
has
gone
to
her
sister
wedding
that
is
why
i
was
going
out
to
spend
the
day
myself
i
arranged
the
plan
to
accommodate
her
how
good
you
are
i
shall
be
quite
comfortable
directly
really
i
can
get
to
my
in
the
now
i
have
rested
a
little
marco
helped
her
to
her
feet
and
her
sharp
involuntary
exclamation
of
pain
made
him
wince
internally
perhaps
it
was
a
worse
sprain
than
she
knew
the
house
was
of
the
london
order
a
front
lobby
with
a
on
the
right
hand
and
a
back
lobby
after
the
foot
of
the
stairs
was
passed
out
of
which
opened
the
basement
kitchen
staircase
and
a
looking
out
on
a
gloomy
flagged
back
yard
inclosed
by
high
walls
the
was
rather
gloomy
itself
but
there
were
a
few
luxurious
things
among
the
ordinary
furnishings
there
was
an
with
a
small
table
near
it
and
on
the
table
were
a
silver
lamp
and
some
rather
elegant
trifles
marco
helped
his
charge
to
the
and
put
a
cushion
from
the
sofa
under
her
foot
he
did
it
very
gently
and
as
he
rose
after
doing
it
he
saw
that
the
long
soft
dark
eyes
were
looking
at
him
in
a
curious
way
i
must
go
away
now
he
said
but
i
do
not
like
to
leave
you
may
i
go
for
a
doctor
how
dear
you
are
she
exclaimed
but
i
do
not
want
one
thank
you
i
know
exactly
what
to
do
for
a
sprained
ankle
and
perhaps
mine
is
not
really
a
sprain
i
am
going
to
take
off
my
shoe
and
see
may
i
help
you
marco
asked
and
he
kneeled
down
again
and
carefully
unfastened
her
shoe
and
withdrew
it
from
her
foot
it
was
a
slender
and
delicate
foot
in
a
silk
stocking
and
she
bent
and
gently
touched
and
rubbed
it
no
she
said
when
she
raised
herself
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
sprain
now
that
the
shoe
is
off
and
the
foot
rests
on
the
cushion
it
is
much
more
comfortable
much
more
thank
you
thank
you
if
you
had
not
been
passing
i
might
have
had
a
dangerous
fall
i
am
very
glad
to
have
been
able
to
help
you
marco
answered
with
an
air
of
relief
now
i
must
go
if
you
think
you
will
be
all
right
do
go
yet
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
i
should
like
to
know
you
a
little
better
if
i
may
i
am
so
grateful
i
should
like
to
talk
to
you
you
have
such
beautiful
manners
for
a
boy
she
ended
with
a
pretty
kind
laugh
and
i
believe
i
know
where
you
got
them
from
you
are
very
kind
to
me
marco
answered
wondering
if
he
did
not
redden
a
little
but
i
must
go
because
my
father
will
your
father
would
let
you
stay
and
talk
to
me
she
said
with
even
a
prettier
kindliness
than
before
it
is
from
him
you
have
inherited
your
beautiful
manner
he
was
once
a
friend
of
mine
i
hope
he
is
my
friend
still
though
perhaps
he
has
forgotten
me
all
that
marco
had
ever
learned
and
all
that
he
had
ever
trained
himself
to
remember
quickly
rushed
back
upon
him
now
because
he
had
a
clear
and
rapidly
working
brain
and
had
not
lived
the
ordinary
boy
life
here
was
a
beautiful
lady
of
whom
he
knew
nothing
at
all
but
that
she
had
twisted
her
foot
in
the
street
and
he
had
helped
her
back
into
her
house
if
silence
was
still
the
order
it
was
not
for
him
to
know
things
or
ask
questions
or
answer
them
she
might
be
the
loveliest
lady
in
the
world
and
his
father
her
dearest
friend
but
even
if
this
were
so
he
could
best
serve
them
both
by
obeying
her
friend
commands
with
all
courtesy
and
forgetting
no
instruction
he
had
given
i
do
not
think
my
father
ever
forgets
any
one
he
answered
no
i
am
sure
he
does
not
she
said
softly
has
he
been
to
samavia
during
the
last
three
years
marco
paused
a
moment
perhaps
i
am
not
the
boy
you
think
i
am
he
said
my
father
has
never
been
to
samavia
he
has
not
but
you
are
marco
loristan
yes
that
is
my
name
suddenly
she
leaned
forward
and
her
long
lovely
eyes
filled
with
fire
then
you
are
a
samavian
and
you
know
of
the
disasters
overwhelming
us
you
know
all
the
hideousness
and
barbarity
of
what
is
being
done
your
father
son
must
know
it
all
every
one
knows
it
said
marco
but
it
is
your
country
your
own
your
blood
must
burn
in
your
veins
marco
stood
quite
still
and
looked
at
her
his
eyes
told
whether
his
blood
burned
or
not
but
he
did
not
speak
his
look
was
answer
enough
since
he
did
not
wish
to
say
anything
what
does
your
father
think
i
am
a
samavian
myself
and
i
think
night
and
day
what
does
he
think
of
the
rumor
about
the
descendant
of
the
lost
prince
does
he
believe
it
marco
was
thinking
very
rapidly
her
beautiful
face
was
glowing
with
emotion
her
beautiful
voice
trembled
that
she
should
be
a
samavian
and
love
samavia
and
pour
her
feeling
forth
even
to
a
boy
was
deeply
moving
to
him
but
howsoever
one
was
moved
one
must
remember
that
silence
was
still
the
order
when
one
was
very
young
one
must
remember
orders
first
of
all
it
might
be
only
a
newspaper
story
he
said
he
says
one
can
not
trust
such
things
if
you
know
him
you
know
he
is
very
calm
has
he
taught
you
to
be
calm
too
she
said
pathetically
you
are
only
a
boy
boys
are
not
calm
neither
are
women
when
their
hearts
are
wrung
oh
my
samavia
oh
my
poor
little
country
my
brave
tortured
country
and
with
a
sudden
sob
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
a
great
lump
mounted
to
marco
throat
boys
could
not
cry
but
he
knew
what
she
meant
when
he
said
her
heart
was
wrung
when
she
lifted
her
head
the
tears
in
her
eyes
made
them
softer
than
ever
if
i
were
a
million
samavians
instead
of
one
woman
i
should
know
what
to
do
she
cried
if
your
father
were
a
million
samavians
he
would
know
too
he
would
find
ivor
descendant
if
he
is
on
the
earth
and
he
would
end
all
this
horror
who
would
not
end
it
if
they
could
cried
marco
quite
fiercely
but
men
like
your
father
men
who
are
samavians
must
think
night
and
day
about
it
as
i
do
she
impetuously
insisted
you
see
i
can
not
help
pouring
my
thoughts
out
even
to
a
boy
because
he
is
a
samavian
only
samavians
care
samavia
seems
so
little
and
unimportant
to
other
people
they
do
even
seem
to
know
that
the
blood
she
is
pouring
forth
pours
from
human
veins
and
beating
human
hearts
men
like
your
father
must
think
and
plan
and
feel
that
they
must
must
find
a
way
even
a
woman
feels
it
even
a
boy
must
stefan
loristan
can
not
be
sitting
quietly
at
home
knowing
that
samavian
hearts
are
being
shot
through
and
samavian
blood
poured
forth
he
can
not
think
and
say
marco
started
in
spite
of
himself
he
felt
as
if
his
father
had
been
struck
in
the
face
how
dare
she
say
such
words
big
as
he
was
suddenly
he
looked
bigger
and
the
beautiful
lady
saw
that
he
did
he
is
my
father
he
said
slowly
she
was
a
clever
beautiful
person
and
saw
that
she
had
made
a
great
mistake
you
must
forgive
me
she
exclaimed
i
used
the
wrong
words
because
i
was
excited
that
is
the
way
with
women
you
must
see
that
i
meant
that
i
knew
he
was
giving
his
heart
and
strength
his
whole
being
to
samavia
even
though
he
must
stay
in
london
she
started
and
turned
her
head
to
listen
to
the
sound
of
some
one
using
the
and
opening
the
front
door
the
some
one
came
in
with
the
heavy
step
of
a
man
it
is
one
of
the
lodgers
she
said
i
think
it
is
the
one
who
lives
in
the
third
floor
then
you
wo
be
alone
when
i
go
said
marco
i
am
glad
some
one
has
come
i
will
say
may
i
tell
my
father
your
name
tell
me
that
you
are
not
angry
with
me
for
expressing
myself
so
awkwardly
she
said
you
could
have
meant
it
i
know
that
marco
answered
boyishly
you
could
no
i
could
she
repeated
with
the
same
emphasis
on
the
words
she
took
a
card
from
a
silver
case
on
the
table
and
gave
it
to
him
your
father
will
remember
my
name
she
said
i
hope
he
will
let
me
see
him
and
tell
him
how
you
took
care
of
me
she
shook
his
hand
warmly
and
let
him
go
but
just
as
he
reached
the
door
she
spoke
again
oh
may
i
ask
you
to
do
one
thing
more
before
you
leave
me
she
said
suddenly
i
hope
you
wo
mind
will
you
run
into
the
and
bring
me
the
purple
book
from
the
small
table
i
shall
not
mind
being
alone
if
i
have
something
to
read
a
purple
book
on
a
small
table
said
marco
between
the
two
long
windows
she
smiled
back
at
him
the
of
such
houses
as
these
is
always
to
be
reached
by
one
short
flight
of
stairs
marco
ran
up
lightly
xiv
marco
does
not
answer
by
the
time
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
stairs
the
beautiful
lady
had
risen
from
her
seat
in
the
back
room
and
walked
into
the
at
the
front
a
man
was
standing
inside
the
door
as
if
waiting
for
her
i
could
do
nothing
with
him
she
said
at
once
in
her
soft
voice
speaking
quite
prettily
and
gently
as
if
what
she
said
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
i
managed
the
little
trick
of
the
sprained
foot
really
well
and
got
him
into
the
house
he
is
an
amiable
boy
with
perfect
manners
and
i
thought
it
might
be
easy
to
surprise
him
into
saying
more
than
he
knew
he
was
saying
you
can
generally
do
that
with
children
and
young
things
but
he
either
knows
nothing
or
has
been
trained
to
hold
his
tongue
he
not
stupid
and
he
of
a
high
spirit
i
made
a
pathetic
little
scene
about
samavia
because
i
saw
he
could
be
worked
up
it
did
work
him
up
i
tried
him
with
the
lost
prince
rumor
but
if
there
is
truth
in
it
he
does
not
or
will
not
know
i
tried
to
make
him
lose
his
temper
and
betray
something
in
defending
his
father
whom
he
thinks
a
god
by
the
way
but
i
made
a
mistake
i
saw
that
a
pity
boys
can
sometimes
be
made
to
tell
anything
she
spoke
very
quickly
under
her
breath
the
man
spoke
quickly
too
where
is
he
he
asked
i
sent
him
up
to
the
to
look
for
a
book
he
will
look
for
a
few
minutes
listen
he
an
innocent
boy
he
sees
me
only
as
a
gentle
angel
nothing
will
him
so
much
as
to
hear
me
tell
him
the
truth
suddenly
it
will
be
such
a
shock
to
him
that
perhaps
you
can
do
something
with
him
then
he
may
lose
his
hold
on
himself
he
only
a
boy
you
right
said
the
bearded
man
and
when
he
finds
out
he
is
not
free
to
go
it
may
alarm
him
and
we
may
get
something
worth
while
if
we
could
find
out
what
is
true
or
what
loristan
thinks
is
true
we
should
have
a
clue
to
work
from
she
said
we
have
not
much
time
the
man
whispered
we
are
ordered
to
bosnia
at
once
before
midnight
we
must
be
on
the
way
let
us
go
into
the
other
room
he
is
coming
when
marco
entered
the
room
the
man
with
the
pointed
dark
beard
was
standing
by
the
i
am
sorry
i
could
not
find
the
book
he
apologized
i
looked
on
all
the
tables
i
shall
be
obliged
to
go
and
search
for
it
myself
said
the
lovely
person
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
stood
up
smiling
and
at
her
first
movement
marco
saw
that
she
was
not
disabled
in
the
least
your
foot
he
exclaimed
it
better
it
was
hurt
she
answered
in
her
softly
pretty
voice
and
with
her
softly
pretty
smile
i
only
made
you
think
so
it
was
part
of
her
plan
to
spare
him
nothing
of
shock
in
her
sudden
transformation
marco
felt
his
breath
leave
him
for
a
moment
i
made
you
believe
i
was
hurt
because
i
wanted
you
to
come
into
the
house
with
me
she
added
i
wished
to
find
out
certain
things
i
am
sure
you
know
they
were
things
about
samavia
said
the
man
your
father
knows
them
and
you
must
know
something
of
them
at
least
it
is
necessary
that
we
should
hear
what
you
can
tell
us
we
shall
not
allow
you
to
leave
the
house
until
you
have
answered
certain
questions
i
shall
ask
you
then
marco
began
to
understand
he
had
heard
his
father
speak
of
political
spies
men
and
women
who
were
paid
to
trace
the
people
that
certain
governments
or
political
parties
desired
to
have
followed
and
observed
he
knew
it
was
their
work
to
search
out
secrets
to
disguise
themselves
and
live
among
innocent
people
as
if
they
were
merely
ordinary
neighbors
they
must
be
spies
who
were
paid
to
follow
his
father
because
he
was
a
samavian
and
a
patriot
he
did
not
know
that
they
had
taken
the
house
two
months
before
and
had
accomplished
several
things
during
their
apparently
innocent
stay
in
it
they
had
discovered
loristan
and
had
learned
to
know
his
outgoings
and
incomings
and
also
the
outgoings
and
incomings
of
lazarus
marco
and
the
rat
but
they
meant
if
possible
to
learn
other
things
if
the
boy
could
be
startled
and
terrified
into
unconscious
revelations
it
might
prove
well
worth
their
while
to
have
played
this
bit
of
melodrama
before
they
locked
the
front
door
behind
them
and
hastily
crossed
the
channel
leaving
their
landlord
to
discover
for
himself
that
the
house
had
been
vacated
in
marco
mind
strange
things
were
happening
they
were
spies
but
that
was
not
all
the
lovely
person
had
been
right
when
she
said
that
he
would
receive
a
shock
his
strong
young
chest
swelled
in
all
his
life
he
had
never
come
face
to
face
with
black
treachery
before
he
could
not
grasp
it
this
gentle
and
friendly
being
with
the
grateful
soft
voice
and
grateful
soft
eyes
had
betrayed
him
it
seemed
impossible
to
believe
it
and
yet
the
smile
on
her
curved
mouth
told
him
that
it
was
true
when
he
had
sprung
to
help
her
she
had
been
playing
a
trick
when
he
had
been
sorry
for
her
pain
and
had
winced
at
the
sound
of
her
low
exclamation
she
had
been
deliberately
laying
a
trap
to
harm
him
for
a
few
seconds
he
was
stunned
perhaps
if
he
had
not
been
his
father
son
he
might
have
been
stunned
only
but
he
was
more
when
the
first
seconds
had
passed
there
arose
slowly
within
him
a
sense
of
something
like
high
remote
disdain
it
grew
in
his
deep
boy
eyes
as
he
gazed
directly
into
the
pupils
of
the
long
soft
dark
ones
his
body
felt
as
if
it
were
growing
taller
you
are
very
clever
he
said
slowly
then
after
a
second
pause
he
added
i
was
too
young
to
know
that
there
was
any
one
so
clever
in
the
world
the
lovely
person
laughed
but
she
did
not
laugh
easily
she
spoke
to
her
companion
a
she
said
as
one
looks
at
him
one
half
believes
it
is
true
the
man
with
the
beard
was
looking
very
angry
his
eyes
were
savage
and
his
dark
skin
reddened
marco
thought
that
he
looked
at
him
as
if
he
hated
him
and
was
made
fierce
by
the
mere
sight
of
him
for
some
mysterious
reason
two
days
before
you
left
moscow
he
said
three
men
came
to
see
your
father
they
looked
like
peasants
they
talked
to
him
for
more
than
an
hour
they
brought
with
them
a
roll
of
parchment
is
that
not
true
i
know
nothing
said
marco
before
you
went
to
moscow
you
were
in
budapest
you
went
there
from
vienna
you
were
there
for
three
months
and
your
father
saw
many
people
some
of
them
came
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
know
nothing
said
marco
you
have
spent
your
life
in
traveling
from
one
country
to
another
persisted
the
man
you
know
the
european
languages
as
if
you
were
a
courier
or
the
in
a
viennese
hotel
do
you
not
marco
did
not
answer
the
lovely
person
began
to
speak
to
the
man
rapidly
in
russian
a
spy
and
an
adventurer
stefan
loristan
has
always
been
and
always
will
be
she
said
we
know
what
he
is
the
police
in
every
capital
in
europe
know
him
as
a
sharper
and
a
vagabond
as
well
as
a
spy
and
yet
with
all
his
cleverness
he
does
not
seem
to
have
money
what
did
he
do
with
the
bribe
the
maranovitch
gave
him
for
betraying
what
he
knew
of
the
old
fortress
the
boy
does
even
suspect
him
perhaps
it
true
that
he
knows
nothing
or
perhaps
it
is
true
that
he
has
been
so
and
flogged
from
his
babyhood
that
he
dare
not
speak
there
is
a
cowed
look
in
his
eyes
in
spite
of
his
childish
swagger
he
been
both
starved
and
beaten
the
outburst
was
well
done
she
did
not
look
at
marco
as
she
poured
forth
her
words
she
spoke
with
the
abruptness
and
impetuosity
of
a
person
whose
feelings
had
got
the
better
of
her
if
marco
was
sensitive
about
his
father
she
felt
sure
that
his
youth
would
make
his
face
reveal
something
if
his
tongue
did
not
if
he
understood
russian
which
was
one
of
the
things
it
would
be
useful
to
find
out
because
it
was
a
fact
which
would
verify
many
other
things
marco
face
disappointed
her
no
change
took
place
in
it
and
the
blood
did
not
rise
to
the
surface
of
his
skin
he
listened
with
an
uninterested
air
blank
and
cold
and
polite
let
them
say
what
they
chose
the
man
twisted
his
pointed
beard
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
we
have
a
good
little
downstairs
he
said
you
are
going
down
into
it
and
you
will
probably
stay
there
for
some
time
if
you
do
not
make
up
your
mind
to
answer
my
questions
you
think
that
nothing
can
happen
to
you
in
a
house
in
a
london
street
where
policemen
walk
up
and
down
but
you
are
mistaken
if
you
yelled
now
even
if
any
one
chanced
to
hear
you
they
would
only
think
you
were
a
lad
getting
a
thrashing
he
deserved
you
can
yell
as
much
as
you
like
in
the
black
little
and
no
one
will
hear
at
all
we
only
took
this
house
for
three
months
and
we
shall
leave
it
without
mentioning
the
fact
to
any
one
if
we
choose
to
leave
you
in
the
you
will
wait
there
until
somebody
begins
to
notice
that
no
one
goes
in
and
out
and
chances
to
mention
it
to
the
landlord
which
few
people
would
take
the
trouble
to
do
did
you
come
here
from
moscow
i
know
nothing
said
marco
you
might
remain
in
the
good
little
black
cellar
an
unpleasantly
long
time
before
you
were
found
the
man
went
on
quite
coolly
do
you
remember
the
peasants
who
came
to
see
your
father
two
nights
before
you
left
i
know
nothing
said
marco
by
the
time
it
was
discovered
that
the
house
was
empty
and
people
came
in
to
make
sure
you
might
be
too
weak
to
call
out
and
attract
their
attention
did
you
go
to
budapest
from
vienna
and
were
you
there
for
three
months
asked
the
inquisitor
i
know
nothing
said
marco
you
are
too
good
for
the
little
black
cellar
put
in
the
lovely
person
i
like
you
do
go
into
it
i
know
nothing
marco
answered
but
the
eyes
which
were
like
loristan
gave
her
just
such
a
look
as
loristan
would
have
given
her
and
she
felt
it
it
made
her
uncomfortable
i
do
believe
you
were
ever
or
beaten
she
said
i
tell
you
the
little
black
cellar
will
be
a
hard
thing
do
go
there
and
this
time
marco
said
nothing
but
looked
at
her
still
as
if
he
were
some
great
young
noble
who
was
very
proud
he
knew
that
every
word
the
bearded
man
had
spoken
was
true
to
cry
out
would
be
of
no
use
if
they
went
away
and
left
him
behind
them
there
was
no
knowing
how
many
days
would
pass
before
the
people
of
the
neighborhood
would
begin
to
suspect
that
the
place
had
been
deserted
or
how
long
it
would
be
before
it
occurred
to
some
one
to
give
warning
to
the
owner
and
in
the
meantime
neither
his
father
nor
lazarus
nor
the
rat
would
have
the
faintest
reason
for
guessing
where
he
was
and
he
would
be
sitting
alone
in
the
dark
in
the
he
did
not
know
in
the
least
what
to
do
about
this
thing
he
only
knew
that
silence
was
still
the
order
it
is
a
little
hole
the
man
said
you
might
crack
your
throat
in
it
and
no
one
would
hear
did
men
come
to
talk
with
your
father
in
the
middle
of
the
night
when
you
were
in
vienna
i
know
nothing
said
marco
he
wo
tell
said
the
lovely
person
i
am
sorry
for
this
boy
he
may
tell
after
he
has
sat
in
the
good
little
black
for
a
few
hours
said
the
man
with
the
pointed
beard
come
with
me
he
put
his
powerful
hand
on
marco
shoulder
and
pushed
him
before
him
marco
made
no
struggle
he
remembered
what
his
father
had
said
about
the
game
not
being
a
game
it
was
a
game
now
but
somehow
he
had
a
strong
haughty
feeling
of
not
being
afraid
he
was
taken
through
the
hallway
toward
the
rear
and
down
the
commonplace
flagged
steps
which
led
to
the
basement
then
he
was
marched
through
a
narrow
flagged
passage
to
a
door
in
the
wall
the
door
was
not
locked
and
stood
a
trifle
ajar
his
companion
pushed
it
farther
open
and
showed
part
of
a
which
was
so
dark
that
it
was
only
the
shelves
nearest
the
door
that
marco
could
faintly
see
his
captor
pushed
him
in
and
shut
the
door
it
was
as
black
a
hole
as
he
had
described
marco
stood
still
in
the
midst
of
darkness
like
black
velvet
his
guard
turned
the
key
the
peasants
who
came
to
your
father
in
moscow
spoke
samavian
and
were
big
men
do
you
remember
them
he
asked
from
outside
i
know
nothing
answered
marco
you
are
a
young
fool
the
voice
replied
and
i
believe
you
know
even
more
than
we
thought
your
father
will
be
greatly
troubled
when
you
do
not
come
home
i
will
come
back
to
see
you
in
a
few
hours
if
it
is
possible
i
will
tell
you
however
that
i
have
had
disturbing
news
which
might
make
it
necessary
for
us
to
leave
the
house
in
a
hurry
i
might
not
have
time
to
come
down
here
again
before
leaving
marco
stood
with
his
back
against
a
bit
of
wall
and
remained
silent
there
was
stillness
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
there
was
to
be
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
marching
away
when
the
last
distant
echo
died
all
was
quite
silent
and
marco
drew
a
long
breath
unbelievable
as
it
may
appear
it
was
in
one
sense
almost
a
breath
of
relief
in
the
rush
of
strange
feeling
which
had
swept
over
him
when
he
found
himself
facing
the
astounding
situation
it
had
not
been
easy
to
realize
what
his
thoughts
really
were
there
were
so
many
of
them
and
they
came
so
fast
how
could
he
quite
believe
the
evidence
of
his
eyes
and
ears
a
few
minutes
only
a
few
minutes
had
changed
his
prettily
grateful
and
kindly
acquaintance
into
a
subtle
and
cunning
creature
whose
love
for
samavia
had
been
part
of
a
plot
to
harm
it
and
to
harm
his
father
what
did
she
and
her
companion
want
to
do
what
could
they
do
if
they
knew
the
things
they
were
trying
to
force
him
to
tell
marco
braced
his
back
against
the
wall
stoutly
what
will
it
be
best
to
think
about
first
this
he
said
because
one
of
the
most
absorbingly
fascinating
things
he
and
his
father
talked
about
together
was
the
power
of
the
thoughts
which
human
beings
allow
to
pass
through
their
minds
the
strange
strength
of
them
when
they
talked
of
this
marco
felt
as
if
he
were
listening
to
some
marvelous
eastern
story
of
magic
which
was
true
in
travels
he
had
visited
the
far
oriental
countries
and
he
had
seen
and
learned
many
things
which
seemed
marvels
and
they
had
taught
him
deep
thinking
he
had
known
and
reasoned
through
days
with
men
who
believed
that
when
they
desired
a
thing
clear
and
exalted
thought
would
bring
it
to
them
he
had
discovered
why
they
believed
this
and
had
learned
to
understand
their
profound
arguments
what
he
himself
believed
he
had
taught
marco
quite
simply
from
his
childhood
it
was
this
he
himself
marco
with
the
strong
the
thick
mat
of
black
hair
and
the
patched
clothes
was
the
magician
he
held
and
waved
his
wand
himself
and
his
wand
was
his
own
thought
when
special
privation
or
anxiety
beset
them
it
was
their
rule
to
say
what
will
it
be
best
to
think
about
first
which
was
marco
reason
for
saying
it
to
himself
now
as
he
stood
in
the
darkness
which
was
like
black
velvet
he
waited
a
few
minutes
for
the
right
thing
to
come
to
him
i
will
think
of
the
very
old
hermit
who
lived
on
the
ledge
of
the
mountains
in
india
and
who
let
my
father
talk
to
him
through
all
one
night
he
said
at
last
this
had
been
a
wonderful
story
and
one
of
his
favorites
loristan
had
traveled
far
to
see
this
ancient
buddhist
and
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
during
that
one
night
had
made
changes
in
his
life
the
part
of
the
story
which
came
back
to
marco
now
was
these
words
pass
through
thy
mind
my
son
only
the
image
thou
wouldst
desire
to
see
a
truth
meditate
only
upon
the
wish
of
thy
heart
seeing
first
that
it
can
injure
no
man
and
is
not
ignoble
then
will
it
take
earthly
form
and
draw
near
to
thee
this
is
the
law
of
that
which
i
am
not
afraid
marco
said
aloud
i
shall
not
be
afraid
in
some
way
i
shall
get
out
this
was
the
image
he
wanted
most
to
keep
steadily
in
his
mind
that
nothing
could
make
him
afraid
and
that
in
some
way
he
would
get
out
of
the
he
thought
of
this
for
some
minutes
and
said
the
words
over
several
times
he
felt
more
like
himself
when
he
had
done
it
when
my
eyes
are
accustomed
to
the
darkness
i
shall
see
if
there
is
any
little
glimmer
of
light
anywhere
he
said
next
he
waited
with
patience
and
it
seemed
for
some
time
that
he
saw
no
glimmer
at
all
he
put
out
his
hands
on
either
side
of
him
and
found
that
on
the
side
of
the
wall
against
which
he
stood
there
seemed
to
be
no
shelves
perhaps
the
cellar
had
been
used
for
other
purposes
than
the
storing
of
wine
and
if
that
was
true
there
might
be
somewhere
some
opening
for
ventilation
the
air
was
not
bad
but
then
the
door
had
not
been
shut
tightly
when
the
man
opened
it
i
am
not
afraid
he
repeated
i
shall
not
be
afraid
in
some
way
i
shall
get
out
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
stop
and
think
about
his
father
waiting
for
his
return
he
knew
that
would
only
rouse
his
emotions
and
weaken
his
courage
he
began
to
feel
his
way
carefully
along
the
wall
it
reached
farther
than
he
had
thought
it
would
the
cellar
was
not
so
very
small
he
crept
round
it
gradually
and
when
he
had
crept
round
it
he
made
his
way
across
it
keeping
his
hands
extended
before
him
and
setting
down
each
foot
cautiously
then
he
sat
down
on
the
stone
floor
and
thought
again
and
what
he
thought
was
of
the
things
the
old
buddhist
had
told
his
father
and
that
there
was
a
way
out
of
this
place
for
him
and
he
should
somehow
find
it
and
before
too
long
a
time
had
passed
be
walking
in
the
street
again
it
was
while
he
was
thinking
in
this
way
that
he
felt
a
startling
thing
it
seemed
almost
as
if
something
touched
him
it
made
him
jump
though
the
touch
was
so
light
and
soft
that
it
was
scarcely
a
touch
at
all
in
fact
he
could
not
be
sure
that
he
had
not
imagined
it
he
stood
up
and
leaned
against
the
wall
again
perhaps
the
suddenness
of
his
movement
placed
him
at
some
angle
he
had
not
reached
before
or
perhaps
his
eyes
had
become
more
completely
accustomed
to
the
darkness
for
as
he
turned
his
head
to
listen
he
made
a
discovery
above
the
door
there
was
a
place
where
the
velvet
blackness
was
not
so
dense
there
was
something
like
a
slit
in
the
wall
though
as
it
did
not
open
upon
daylight
but
upon
the
dark
passage
it
was
not
light
it
admitted
so
much
as
a
lesser
shade
of
darkness
but
even
that
was
better
than
nothing
and
marco
drew
another
long
breath
that
is
only
the
beginning
i
shall
find
a
way
out
he
said
i
he
remembered
reading
a
story
of
a
man
who
being
shut
by
accident
in
a
safety
vault
passed
through
such
terrors
before
his
release
that
he
believed
he
had
spent
two
days
and
nights
in
the
place
when
he
had
been
there
only
a
few
hours
his
thoughts
did
that
i
must
remember
i
will
sit
down
again
and
begin
thinking
of
all
the
pictures
in
the
cabinet
rooms
of
the
art
history
museum
in
vienna
it
will
take
some
time
and
then
there
are
the
others
he
said
it
was
a
good
plan
while
he
could
keep
his
mind
upon
the
game
which
had
helped
him
to
pass
so
many
dull
hours
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
as
it
required
close
attention
and
perhaps
as
the
day
went
on
his
captors
would
begin
to
feel
that
it
was
not
safe
to
run
the
risk
of
doing
a
thing
as
desperate
as
this
would
be
they
might
think
better
of
it
before
they
left
the
house
at
least
in
any
case
he
had
learned
enough
from
loristan
to
realize
that
only
harm
could
come
from
letting
one
mind
run
wild
a
mind
is
either
an
engine
with
broken
and
flying
gear
or
a
giant
power
under
control
was
the
thing
they
knew
he
had
walked
in
imagination
through
three
of
the
cabinet
rooms
and
was
turning
mentally
into
a
fourth
when
he
found
himself
starting
again
quite
violently
this
time
it
was
not
at
a
touch
but
at
a
sound
surely
it
was
a
sound
and
it
was
in
the
cellar
with
him
but
it
was
the
tiniest
possible
noise
a
ghost
of
a
squeak
and
a
suggestion
of
a
movement
it
came
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
cellar
the
side
where
the
shelves
were
he
looked
across
in
the
darkness
and
in
the
darkness
saw
a
light
which
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
it
a
light
two
lights
indeed
two
round
phosphorescent
greenish
balls
they
were
two
eyes
staring
at
him
and
then
he
heard
another
sound
not
a
squeak
this
time
but
something
so
homely
and
comfortable
that
he
actually
burst
out
laughing
it
was
a
cat
purring
a
nice
warm
cat
and
she
was
curled
up
on
one
of
the
lower
shelves
purring
to
some
kittens
he
knew
there
were
kittens
because
it
was
plain
now
what
the
tiny
squeak
had
been
and
it
was
made
plainer
by
the
fact
that
he
heard
another
much
more
distinct
one
and
then
another
they
had
all
been
asleep
when
he
had
come
into
the
cellar
if
the
mother
had
been
awake
she
had
probably
been
very
much
afraid
afterward
she
had
perhaps
come
down
from
her
shelf
to
investigate
and
had
passed
close
to
him
the
feeling
of
relief
which
came
upon
him
at
this
queer
and
simple
discovery
was
wonderful
it
was
so
natural
and
comfortable
an
thing
that
it
seemed
to
make
spies
and
criminals
unreal
and
only
natural
things
possible
with
a
mother
cat
purring
away
among
her
kittens
even
a
dark
was
not
so
black
he
got
up
and
kneeled
by
the
shelf
the
greenish
eyes
did
not
shine
in
an
unfriendly
way
he
could
feel
that
the
owner
of
them
was
a
nice
big
cat
and
he
counted
four
round
little
balls
of
kittens
it
was
a
curious
delight
to
stroke
the
soft
fur
and
talk
to
the
mother
cat
she
answered
with
purring
as
if
she
liked
the
sense
of
friendly
human
nearness
marco
laughed
to
himself
it
queer
what
a
difference
it
makes
he
said
it
is
almost
like
finding
a
window
the
mere
presence
of
these
harmless
living
things
was
companionship
he
sat
down
close
to
the
low
shelf
and
listened
to
the
motherly
purring
now
and
then
speaking
and
putting
out
his
hand
to
touch
the
warm
fur
the
phosphorescent
light
in
the
green
eyes
was
a
comfort
in
itself
we
shall
get
out
of
this
both
of
us
he
said
we
shall
not
be
here
very
long
he
was
not
troubled
by
the
fear
of
being
really
hungry
for
some
time
he
was
so
used
to
eating
scantily
from
necessity
and
to
passing
long
hours
without
food
during
his
journeys
that
he
had
proved
to
himself
that
fasting
is
not
after
all
such
a
desperate
ordeal
as
most
people
imagine
if
you
begin
by
expecting
to
feel
famished
and
by
counting
the
hours
between
your
meals
you
will
begin
to
be
ravenous
but
he
knew
better
the
time
passed
slowly
but
he
had
known
it
would
pass
slowly
and
he
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
watch
it
nor
ask
himself
questions
about
it
he
was
not
a
restless
boy
but
like
his
father
could
stand
or
sit
or
lie
still
now
and
then
he
could
hear
distant
rumblings
of
carts
and
vans
passing
in
the
street
there
was
a
certain
degree
of
companionship
in
these
also
he
kept
his
place
near
the
cat
and
his
hand
where
he
could
occasionally
touch
her
he
could
lift
his
eyes
now
and
then
to
the
place
where
the
dim
glimmer
of
something
like
light
showed
itself
perhaps
the
stillness
perhaps
the
darkness
perhaps
the
purring
of
the
mother
cat
probably
all
three
caused
his
thoughts
to
begin
to
travel
through
his
mind
slowly
and
more
slowly
at
last
they
ceased
and
he
fell
asleep
the
mother
cat
purred
for
some
time
and
then
fell
asleep
herself
xv
a
sound
in
a
dream
marco
slept
peacefully
for
several
hours
there
was
nothing
to
awaken
him
during
that
time
but
at
the
end
of
it
his
sleep
was
penetrated
by
a
definite
sound
he
had
dreamed
of
hearing
a
voice
at
a
distance
and
as
he
tried
in
his
dream
to
hear
what
it
said
a
brief
metallic
ringing
sound
awakened
him
outright
it
was
over
by
the
time
he
was
fully
conscious
and
at
once
he
realized
that
the
voice
of
his
dream
had
been
a
real
one
and
was
speaking
still
it
was
the
lovely
person
voice
and
she
was
speaking
rapidly
as
if
she
were
in
the
greatest
haste
she
was
speaking
through
the
door
you
will
have
to
search
for
it
was
all
he
heard
i
have
not
a
moment
and
as
he
listened
to
her
hurriedly
departing
feet
there
came
to
him
with
their
hastening
echoes
the
words
you
are
too
good
for
the
cellar
i
like
you
he
sprang
to
the
door
and
tried
it
but
it
was
still
locked
the
feet
ran
up
the
cellar
steps
and
through
the
upper
hall
and
the
front
door
closed
with
a
bang
the
two
people
had
gone
away
as
they
had
threatened
the
voice
had
been
excited
as
well
as
hurried
something
had
happened
to
frighten
them
and
they
had
left
the
house
in
great
haste
marco
turned
and
stood
with
his
back
against
the
door
the
cat
had
awakened
and
she
was
gazing
at
him
with
her
green
eyes
she
began
to
purr
encouragingly
she
really
helped
marco
to
think
he
was
thinking
with
all
his
might
and
trying
to
remember
what
did
she
come
for
she
came
for
something
he
said
to
himself
what
did
she
say
i
only
heard
part
of
it
because
i
was
asleep
the
voice
in
the
dream
was
part
of
it
the
part
i
heard
was
will
have
to
search
for
it
i
have
not
a
moment
and
as
she
ran
down
the
passage
she
called
back
are
too
good
for
the
cellar
i
like
you
he
said
the
words
over
and
over
again
and
tried
to
recall
exactly
how
they
had
sounded
and
also
to
recall
the
voice
which
had
seemed
to
be
part
of
a
dream
but
had
been
a
real
thing
then
he
began
to
try
his
favorite
experiment
as
he
often
tried
the
experiment
of
commanding
his
mind
to
go
to
sleep
so
he
frequently
experimented
on
commanding
it
to
work
for
him
to
help
him
to
remember
to
understand
and
to
argue
about
things
clearly
reason
this
out
for
me
he
said
to
it
now
quite
naturally
and
calmly
show
me
what
it
means
what
did
she
come
for
it
was
certain
that
she
was
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
be
able
without
a
reason
to
spare
the
time
to
come
what
was
the
reason
she
had
said
she
liked
him
then
she
came
because
she
liked
him
if
she
liked
him
she
came
to
do
something
which
was
not
unfriendly
the
only
good
thing
she
could
do
for
him
was
something
which
would
help
him
to
get
out
of
the
cellar
she
had
said
twice
that
he
was
too
good
for
the
cellar
if
he
had
been
awake
he
would
have
heard
all
she
said
and
have
understood
what
she
wanted
him
to
do
or
meant
to
do
for
him
he
must
not
stop
even
to
think
of
that
the
first
words
he
had
heard
what
had
they
been
they
had
been
less
clear
to
him
than
her
last
because
he
had
heard
them
only
as
he
was
awakening
but
he
thought
he
was
sure
that
they
had
been
you
will
have
to
search
for
it
search
for
it
for
what
he
thought
and
thought
what
must
he
search
for
he
sat
down
on
the
floor
of
the
cellar
and
held
his
head
in
his
hands
pressing
his
eyes
so
hard
that
curious
lights
floated
before
them
tell
me
tell
me
he
said
to
that
part
of
his
being
which
the
buddhist
anchorite
had
said
held
all
knowledge
and
could
tell
a
man
everything
if
he
called
upon
it
in
the
right
spirit
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
recalled
something
which
seemed
so
much
a
part
of
his
sleep
that
he
had
not
been
sure
that
he
had
not
dreamed
it
the
ringing
sound
he
sprang
up
on
his
feet
with
a
little
gasping
shout
the
ringing
sound
it
had
been
the
ring
of
metal
striking
as
it
fell
anything
made
of
metal
might
have
sounded
like
that
she
had
thrown
something
made
of
metal
into
the
cellar
she
had
thrown
it
through
the
slit
in
the
bricks
near
the
door
she
liked
him
and
said
he
was
too
good
for
his
prison
she
had
thrown
to
him
the
only
thing
which
could
set
him
free
she
had
thrown
him
the
of
the
cellar
for
a
few
minutes
the
feelings
which
surged
through
him
were
so
full
of
strong
excitement
that
they
set
his
brain
in
a
whirl
he
knew
what
his
father
would
say
that
would
not
do
if
he
was
to
think
he
must
hold
himself
still
and
not
let
even
joy
overcome
him
the
key
was
in
the
black
little
cellar
and
he
must
find
it
in
the
dark
even
the
woman
who
liked
him
enough
to
give
him
a
chance
of
freedom
knew
that
she
must
not
open
the
door
and
let
him
out
there
must
be
a
delay
he
would
have
to
find
the
key
himself
and
it
would
be
sure
to
take
time
the
chances
were
that
they
would
be
at
a
safe
enough
distance
before
he
could
get
out
i
will
kneel
down
and
crawl
on
my
hands
and
knees
he
said
i
will
crawl
back
and
forth
and
go
over
every
inch
of
the
floor
with
my
hands
until
i
find
it
if
i
go
over
every
inch
i
shall
find
it
so
he
kneeled
down
and
began
to
crawl
and
the
cat
watched
him
and
purred
we
shall
get
out
he
said
to
her
i
told
you
we
should
he
crawled
from
the
door
to
the
wall
at
the
side
of
the
shelves
and
then
he
crawled
back
again
the
key
might
be
quite
a
small
one
and
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
pass
his
hands
over
every
inch
as
he
had
said
the
difficulty
was
to
be
sure
in
the
darkness
that
he
did
not
miss
an
inch
sometimes
he
was
not
sure
enough
and
then
he
went
over
the
ground
again
he
crawled
backward
and
forward
and
he
crawled
forward
and
backward
he
crawled
crosswise
and
lengthwise
he
crawled
diagonally
and
he
crawled
round
and
round
but
he
did
not
find
the
key
if
he
had
had
only
a
little
light
but
he
had
none
he
was
so
absorbed
in
his
search
that
he
did
not
know
he
had
been
engaged
in
it
for
several
hours
and
that
it
was
the
middle
of
the
night
but
at
last
he
realized
that
he
must
stop
for
a
rest
because
his
knees
were
beginning
to
feel
bruised
and
the
skin
of
his
hands
was
sore
as
a
result
of
the
rubbing
on
the
flags
the
cat
and
her
kittens
had
gone
to
sleep
and
awakened
again
two
or
three
times
but
it
is
somewhere
he
said
obstinately
it
is
inside
the
cellar
i
heard
something
fall
which
was
made
of
metal
that
was
the
ringing
sound
which
awakened
me
when
he
stood
up
he
found
his
body
ached
and
he
was
very
tired
he
stretched
himself
and
exercised
his
arms
and
legs
i
wonder
how
long
i
have
been
crawling
about
he
thought
but
the
key
is
in
the
cellar
it
is
in
the
cellar
he
sat
down
near
the
cat
and
her
family
and
laying
his
arm
on
the
shelf
above
her
rested
his
head
on
it
he
began
to
think
of
another
experiment
i
am
so
tired
i
believe
i
shall
go
to
sleep
again
which
knows
all
he
was
quoting
something
the
hermit
had
said
to
loristan
in
their
midnight
talk
thought
which
knows
all
show
me
this
little
thing
lead
me
to
it
when
i
awake
and
he
did
fall
asleep
sound
and
fast
he
did
not
know
that
he
slept
all
the
rest
of
the
night
but
he
did
when
he
awakened
it
was
daylight
in
the
streets
and
the
were
beginning
to
jingle
about
and
the
early
postmen
were
knocking
big
at
front
doors
the
cat
may
have
heard
the
but
the
actual
fact
was
that
she
herself
was
hungry
and
wanted
to
go
in
search
of
food
just
as
marco
lifted
his
head
from
his
arm
and
sat
up
she
jumped
down
from
her
shelf
and
went
to
the
door
she
had
expected
to
find
it
ajar
as
it
had
been
before
when
she
found
it
shut
she
scratched
at
it
and
was
disturbed
to
find
this
of
no
use
because
she
knew
marco
was
in
the
cellar
she
felt
she
had
a
friend
who
would
assist
her
and
she
miaued
appealingly
this
reminded
marco
of
the
key
i
will
when
i
have
found
it
he
said
it
is
inside
the
cellar
the
cat
miaued
again
this
time
very
anxiously
indeed
the
kittens
heard
her
and
began
to
squirm
and
squeak
piteously
lead
me
to
this
little
thing
said
marco
as
if
speaking
to
something
in
the
darkness
about
him
and
he
got
up
he
put
his
hand
out
toward
the
kittens
and
it
touched
something
lying
not
far
from
them
it
must
have
been
lying
near
his
elbow
all
night
while
he
slept
it
was
the
key
it
had
fallen
upon
the
shelf
and
not
on
the
floor
at
all
marco
picked
it
up
and
then
stood
still
a
moment
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
then
he
found
his
way
to
the
door
and
fumbled
until
he
found
the
keyhole
and
got
the
key
into
it
then
he
turned
it
and
pushed
the
door
open
and
the
cat
ran
out
into
the
passage
before
him
xvi
the
rat
to
the
rescue
marco
walked
through
the
passage
and
into
the
kitchen
part
of
the
basement
the
doors
were
all
locked
and
they
were
solid
doors
he
ran
up
the
flagged
steps
and
found
the
door
at
the
top
shut
and
bolted
also
and
that
too
was
a
solid
door
his
jailers
had
plainly
made
sure
that
it
should
take
time
enough
for
him
to
make
his
way
into
the
world
even
after
he
got
out
of
the
the
cat
had
run
away
to
some
part
of
the
place
where
mice
were
plentiful
marco
was
by
this
time
rather
gnawingly
hungry
himself
if
he
could
get
into
the
kitchen
he
might
find
some
fragments
of
food
left
in
a
cupboard
but
there
was
no
moving
the
locked
door
he
tried
the
outlet
into
the
area
but
that
was
immovable
then
he
saw
near
it
a
smaller
door
it
was
evidently
the
entrance
to
the
under
the
pavement
this
was
proved
by
the
fact
that
trodden
marked
the
flagstones
and
near
it
stood
a
scuttle
with
coal
in
it
this
was
the
thing
which
might
help
him
above
the
area
door
was
a
small
window
which
was
supposed
to
light
the
entry
he
could
not
reach
it
and
if
he
reached
it
he
could
not
open
it
he
could
throw
pieces
of
coal
at
the
glass
and
break
it
and
then
he
could
shout
for
help
when
people
passed
by
they
might
not
notice
or
understand
where
the
shouts
came
from
at
first
but
if
he
kept
them
up
some
attention
would
be
attracted
in
the
end
he
picked
a
solid
piece
of
coal
out
of
the
heap
in
the
scuttle
and
threw
it
with
all
his
force
against
the
grimy
glass
it
smashed
through
and
left
a
big
hole
he
threw
another
and
the
entire
pane
was
splintered
and
fell
outside
into
the
area
then
he
saw
it
was
broad
daylight
and
guessed
that
he
had
been
shut
up
a
good
many
hours
there
was
plenty
of
coal
in
the
scuttle
and
he
had
a
strong
arm
and
a
good
aim
he
smashed
pane
after
pane
until
only
the
framework
remained
when
he
shouted
there
would
be
nothing
between
his
voice
and
the
street
no
one
could
see
him
but
if
he
could
do
something
which
would
make
people
slacken
their
pace
to
listen
then
he
could
call
out
that
he
was
in
the
basement
of
the
house
with
the
broken
window
hallo
he
shouted
hallo
hallo
hallo
hallo
but
vehicles
were
passing
in
the
street
and
the
were
absorbed
in
their
own
business
if
they
heard
a
sound
they
did
not
stop
to
inquire
into
it
hallo
hallo
i
am
locked
in
yelled
marco
at
the
topmost
power
of
his
lungs
hallo
hallo
after
half
an
hour
shouting
he
began
to
think
that
he
was
wasting
his
strength
they
only
think
it
is
a
boy
shouting
he
said
some
one
will
notice
in
time
at
night
when
the
streets
are
quiet
i
might
make
a
policeman
hear
but
my
father
does
not
know
where
i
am
he
will
be
trying
to
find
me
so
will
lazarus
so
will
the
rat
one
of
them
might
pass
through
this
very
street
as
i
did
what
can
i
do
a
new
idea
flashed
light
upon
him
i
will
begin
to
sing
a
samavian
song
and
i
will
sing
it
very
loud
people
nearly
always
stop
a
moment
to
listen
to
music
and
find
out
where
it
comes
from
and
if
any
of
my
own
people
came
near
they
would
stop
at
once
and
now
and
then
i
will
shout
for
help
once
when
they
had
stopped
to
rest
on
hampstead
heath
he
had
sung
a
valiant
samavian
song
for
the
rat
the
rat
had
wanted
to
hear
how
he
would
sing
when
they
went
on
their
secret
journey
he
wanted
him
to
sing
for
the
squad
some
day
to
make
the
thing
seem
real
the
rat
had
been
greatly
excited
and
had
begged
for
the
song
often
it
was
a
stirring
martial
thing
with
a
sort
of
trumpet
call
of
a
chorus
thousands
of
samavians
had
sung
it
together
on
their
way
to
the
hundreds
of
years
ago
he
drew
back
a
step
or
so
and
putting
his
hands
on
his
hips
began
to
sing
throwing
his
voice
upward
that
it
might
pass
through
the
broken
window
he
had
a
splendid
and
vibrant
young
voice
though
he
knew
nothing
of
its
fine
quality
just
now
he
wanted
only
to
make
it
loud
in
the
street
outside
very
few
people
were
passing
an
irritable
old
gentleman
who
was
taking
an
invalid
walk
quite
jumped
with
annoyance
when
the
song
suddenly
trumpeted
forth
boys
had
no
right
to
yell
in
that
manner
he
hurried
his
step
to
get
away
from
the
sound
two
or
three
other
people
glanced
over
their
shoulders
but
had
not
time
to
loiter
a
few
others
listened
with
pleasure
as
they
drew
near
and
passed
on
there
a
boy
with
a
fine
voice
said
one
what
he
singing
said
his
companion
it
sounds
foreign
do
know
was
the
reply
as
they
went
by
but
at
last
a
young
man
who
was
a
going
to
give
a
lesson
hesitated
and
looked
about
him
the
song
was
very
loud
and
spirited
just
at
this
moment
the
could
not
understand
where
it
came
from
and
paused
to
find
out
the
fact
that
he
stopped
attracted
the
attention
of
the
next
comer
who
also
paused
who
singing
he
asked
where
is
he
singing
i
ca
make
out
the
laughed
sounds
as
if
it
came
out
of
the
ground
and
because
it
was
queer
that
a
song
should
seem
to
be
coming
out
of
the
ground
a
costermonger
stopped
and
then
a
little
boy
and
then
a
workingwoman
and
then
a
lady
there
was
quite
a
little
group
when
another
person
turned
the
corner
of
the
street
he
was
a
shabby
boy
on
crutches
and
he
had
a
frantic
look
on
his
face
and
marco
actually
heard
as
he
drew
near
to
the
group
the
of
crutches
it
might
be
he
thought
it
might
be
and
he
sang
the
of
the
chorus
as
if
it
were
meant
to
reach
the
skies
and
he
sang
it
again
and
again
and
at
the
end
of
it
shouted
hallo
hallo
hallo
hallo
hallo
illustration
the
rat
swung
himself
into
the
group
where
is
he
where
is
he
he
cried
the
rat
swung
himself
into
the
group
and
looked
as
if
he
had
gone
crazy
he
hurled
himself
against
the
people
where
is
he
where
is
he
he
cried
and
he
poured
out
some
breathless
words
it
was
almost
as
if
he
sobbed
them
out
we
been
looking
for
him
all
night
he
shouted
where
is
he
marco
marco
no
one
else
sings
it
but
him
marco
marco
and
out
of
the
area
as
it
seemed
came
a
shout
of
answer
rat
rat
i
here
in
the
cellar
locked
in
i
here
and
a
big
piece
of
coal
came
hurtling
through
the
broken
window
and
fell
crashing
on
the
area
flags
the
rat
got
down
the
steps
into
the
area
as
if
he
had
not
been
on
crutches
but
on
legs
and
banged
on
the
door
shouting
back
marco
marco
here
i
am
who
locked
you
in
how
can
i
get
the
door
open
marco
was
close
against
the
door
inside
it
was
the
rat
it
was
the
rat
and
he
would
be
in
the
street
again
in
a
few
minutes
call
a
policeman
he
shouted
through
the
keyhole
the
people
locked
me
in
on
purpose
and
took
away
the
keys
then
the
group
of
began
to
get
excited
and
press
against
the
area
railings
and
ask
questions
they
could
not
understand
what
had
happened
to
cause
the
boy
with
the
crutches
to
look
as
if
he
were
crazy
with
terror
and
relief
at
the
same
time
and
the
little
boy
ran
delightedly
to
fetch
a
policeman
and
found
one
in
the
next
street
and
with
some
difficulty
persuaded
him
that
it
was
his
business
to
come
and
get
a
door
open
in
an
empty
house
where
a
boy
who
was
a
street
singer
had
got
locked
up
in
a
cellar
xvii
it
is
a
very
bad
sign
the
policeman
was
not
so
much
excited
as
out
of
temper
he
did
not
know
what
marco
knew
or
what
the
rat
knew
some
common
lad
had
got
himself
locked
up
in
a
house
and
some
one
would
have
to
go
to
the
landlord
and
get
a
key
from
him
he
had
no
intention
of
laying
himself
open
to
the
law
by
breaking
into
a
private
house
with
his
truncheon
as
the
rat
expected
him
to
do
he
got
himself
in
through
some
of
his
larks
and
he
have
to
wait
till
he
got
out
without
smashing
locks
he
growled
shaking
the
area
door
how
did
you
get
in
there
he
shouted
it
was
not
easy
for
marco
to
explain
through
a
keyhole
that
he
had
come
in
to
help
a
lady
who
had
met
with
an
accident
the
policeman
thought
this
mere
boy
talk
as
to
the
rest
of
the
story
marco
knew
that
it
could
not
be
related
at
all
without
saying
things
which
could
not
be
explained
to
any
one
but
his
father
he
quickly
made
up
his
mind
that
he
must
let
it
be
believed
that
he
had
been
locked
in
by
some
queer
accident
it
must
be
supposed
that
the
people
had
not
remembered
in
their
haste
that
he
had
not
yet
left
the
house
when
the
young
clerk
from
the
house
agency
came
with
the
keys
he
was
much
disturbed
and
bewildered
after
he
got
inside
they
made
a
bolt
of
it
he
said
that
happens
now
and
then
but
there
something
queer
about
this
what
did
they
lock
these
doors
in
the
basement
for
and
the
one
on
the
stairs
what
did
they
say
to
you
he
asked
marco
staring
at
him
suspiciously
they
said
they
were
obliged
to
go
suddenly
marco
answered
what
were
you
doing
in
the
basement
the
man
took
me
down
and
left
you
there
and
bolted
he
must
have
been
in
a
hurry
the
lady
said
they
had
not
a
moment
time
her
ankle
must
have
got
well
in
short
order
said
the
young
man
i
knew
nothing
about
them
answered
marco
i
had
never
seen
them
before
the
police
were
after
them
the
young
man
said
that
what
i
should
say
they
paid
three
months
rent
in
advance
and
they
have
only
been
here
two
some
of
these
foreign
spies
lurking
about
london
that
what
they
were
the
rat
had
not
waited
until
the
keys
arrived
he
had
swung
himself
at
his
swiftest
pace
back
through
the
streets
to
no
philibert
place
people
turned
and
stared
at
his
wild
pale
face
as
he
almost
shot
past
them
he
had
left
himself
barely
breath
enough
to
speak
with
when
he
reached
the
house
and
banged
on
the
door
with
his
crutch
to
save
time
both
loristan
and
lazarus
came
to
answer
the
rat
leaned
against
the
door
gasping
he
found
he
all
right
he
panted
some
one
had
locked
him
in
a
house
and
left
him
they
sent
for
the
keys
i
going
back
brandon
terrace
no
loristan
and
lazarus
exchanged
glances
both
of
them
were
at
the
moment
as
pale
as
the
rat
help
him
into
the
house
said
loristan
to
lazarus
he
must
stay
here
and
rest
we
will
go
the
rat
knew
it
was
an
order
he
did
not
like
it
but
he
obeyed
this
is
a
bad
sign
master
said
lazarus
as
they
went
out
together
it
is
a
very
bad
one
answered
loristan
god
of
the
right
defend
us
lazarus
groaned
amen
said
loristan
amen
the
group
had
become
a
small
crowd
by
the
time
they
reached
brandon
terrace
marco
had
not
found
it
easy
to
leave
the
place
because
he
was
being
questioned
neither
the
policeman
nor
the
agent
clerk
seemed
willing
to
relinquish
the
idea
that
he
could
give
them
some
information
about
the
absconding
pair
the
entrance
of
loristan
produced
its
usual
effect
the
agent
clerk
lifted
his
hat
and
the
policeman
stood
straight
and
made
salute
neither
of
them
realized
that
the
tall
man
clothes
were
worn
and
threadbare
they
felt
only
that
a
personage
was
before
them
and
that
it
was
not
possible
to
question
his
air
of
absolute
and
serene
authority
he
laid
his
hand
on
marco
shoulder
and
held
it
there
as
he
spoke
when
marco
looked
up
at
him
and
felt
the
closeness
of
his
touch
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
an
embrace
as
if
he
had
caught
him
to
his
breast
my
boy
knew
nothing
of
these
people
he
said
that
i
can
guarantee
he
had
seen
neither
of
them
before
his
entering
the
house
was
the
result
of
no
boyish
trick
he
has
been
shut
up
in
this
place
for
nearly
hours
and
has
had
no
food
i
must
take
him
home
this
is
my
address
he
handed
the
young
man
a
card
then
they
went
home
together
and
all
the
way
to
philibert
place
loristan
firm
hand
held
closely
to
his
boy
shoulder
as
if
he
could
not
endure
to
let
him
go
but
on
the
way
they
said
very
little
father
marco
said
rather
hoarsely
when
they
first
got
away
from
the
house
in
the
terrace
i
ca
talk
well
in
the
street
for
one
thing
i
am
so
glad
to
be
with
you
again
it
seemed
as
if
it
might
turn
out
badly
beloved
one
loristan
said
the
words
in
their
own
samavian
until
you
are
fed
and
at
rest
you
shall
not
talk
at
all
afterward
when
he
was
himself
again
and
was
allowed
to
tell
his
strange
story
marco
found
that
both
his
father
and
lazarus
had
at
once
had
suspicions
when
he
had
not
returned
they
knew
no
ordinary
event
could
have
kept
him
they
were
sure
that
he
must
have
been
detained
against
his
will
and
they
were
also
sure
that
if
he
had
been
so
detained
it
could
only
have
been
for
reasons
they
could
guess
at
this
was
the
card
that
she
gave
me
marco
said
and
he
handed
it
to
loristan
she
said
you
would
remember
the
name
loristan
looked
at
the
lettering
with
an
ironic
i
never
heard
it
before
he
replied
she
would
not
send
me
a
name
i
knew
probably
i
have
never
seen
either
of
them
but
i
know
the
work
they
do
they
are
spies
of
the
maranovitch
and
suspect
that
i
know
something
of
the
lost
prince
they
believed
they
could
terrify
you
into
saying
things
which
would
be
a
clue
men
and
women
of
their
class
will
use
desperate
means
to
gain
their
end
might
they
have
left
me
as
they
threatened
marco
asked
him
they
would
scarcely
have
dared
i
think
too
great
a
hue
and
cry
would
have
been
raised
by
the
discovery
of
such
a
crime
too
many
detectives
would
have
been
set
at
work
to
track
them
but
the
look
in
his
father
eyes
as
he
spoke
and
the
pressure
of
the
hand
he
stretched
out
to
touch
him
made
marco
heart
thrill
he
had
won
a
new
love
and
trust
from
his
father
when
they
sat
together
and
talked
that
night
they
were
closer
to
each
other
souls
than
they
had
ever
been
before
they
sat
in
the
firelight
marco
upon
the
worn
and
they
talked
about
samavia
about
the
war
and
its
struggles
and
about
how
they
might
end
do
you
think
that
some
time
we
might
be
exiles
no
longer
the
boy
said
wistfully
do
you
think
we
might
go
there
together
and
see
it
you
and
i
father
there
was
a
silence
for
a
while
loristan
looked
into
the
sinking
bed
of
red
coal
for
years
for
years
i
have
made
for
my
soul
that
image
he
said
slowly
when
i
think
of
my
friend
on
the
side
of
the
himalayan
mountains
i
say
thought
which
thought
the
world
may
give
us
that
also
xviii
cities
and
faces
the
hours
of
marco
unexplained
absence
had
been
terrible
to
loristan
and
to
lazarus
they
had
reason
for
fears
which
it
was
not
possible
for
them
to
express
as
the
night
drew
on
the
fears
took
stronger
form
they
forgot
the
existence
of
the
rat
who
sat
biting
his
nails
in
the
bedroom
afraid
to
go
out
lest
he
might
lose
the
chance
of
being
given
some
errand
to
do
but
also
afraid
to
show
himself
lest
he
should
seem
in
the
way
i
stay
upstairs
he
had
said
to
lazarus
if
you
just
whistle
come
the
anguish
he
passed
through
as
the
day
went
by
and
lazarus
went
out
and
came
in
and
he
himself
received
no
orders
could
not
have
been
expressed
in
any
ordinary
words
he
writhed
in
his
chair
he
bit
his
nails
to
the
quick
he
wrought
himself
into
a
frenzy
of
misery
and
terror
by
recalling
one
by
one
all
the
crimes
his
knowledge
of
london
supplied
him
with
he
was
doing
nothing
yet
he
dare
not
leave
his
post
it
was
his
post
after
all
though
they
had
not
given
it
to
him
he
must
do
something
in
the
middle
of
the
night
loristan
opened
the
door
of
the
back
because
he
knew
he
must
at
least
go
upstairs
and
throw
himself
upon
his
bed
even
if
he
could
not
sleep
he
started
back
as
the
door
opened
the
rat
was
sitting
huddled
on
the
floor
near
it
with
his
back
against
the
wall
he
had
a
piece
of
paper
in
his
hand
and
his
twisted
face
was
a
weird
thing
to
see
why
are
you
here
loristan
asked
i
been
here
three
hours
sir
i
knew
you
have
to
come
out
sometime
and
i
thought
you
let
me
speak
to
you
will
you
will
you
come
into
the
room
said
loristan
i
will
listen
to
anything
you
want
to
say
what
have
you
been
drawing
on
that
paper
as
the
rat
got
up
in
the
wonderful
way
he
had
taught
himself
the
paper
was
covered
with
lines
which
showed
it
to
be
another
of
his
plans
please
look
at
it
he
begged
i
dare
go
out
lest
you
might
want
to
send
me
somewhere
i
dare
sit
doing
nothing
i
began
remembering
and
thinking
things
out
i
put
down
all
the
streets
and
squares
he
have
walked
through
on
his
way
home
i
not
missed
one
if
let
me
start
out
and
walk
through
every
one
of
them
and
talk
to
the
policemen
on
the
beat
and
look
at
the
houses
and
think
out
things
and
work
at
them
i
not
miss
an
inch
i
not
miss
a
brick
or
a
flagstone
i
his
voice
had
a
hard
sound
but
it
shook
and
he
himself
shook
loristan
touched
his
arm
gently
you
are
a
good
comrade
he
said
it
is
well
for
us
that
you
are
here
you
have
thought
of
a
good
thing
may
i
go
now
said
the
rat
this
moment
if
you
are
ready
was
the
answer
the
rat
swung
himself
to
the
door
loristan
said
to
him
a
thing
which
was
like
the
sudden
lighting
of
a
great
light
in
the
very
center
of
his
being
you
are
one
of
us
now
that
i
know
you
are
doing
this
i
may
even
sleep
you
are
one
of
us
and
it
was
because
he
was
following
this
plan
that
the
rat
had
turned
into
brandon
terrace
and
heard
the
samavian
song
ringing
out
from
the
locked
basement
of
number
yes
he
is
one
of
us
loristan
said
when
he
told
this
part
of
the
story
to
marco
as
they
sat
by
the
fire
i
had
not
been
sure
before
i
wanted
to
be
very
sure
last
night
i
saw
into
the
depths
of
him
and
he
may
be
trusted
from
that
day
the
rat
held
a
new
place
lazarus
himself
strangely
enough
did
not
resent
his
holding
it
the
boy
was
allowed
to
be
near
loristan
as
he
had
never
dared
to
hope
to
be
near
it
was
not
merely
that
he
was
allowed
to
serve
him
in
many
ways
but
he
was
taken
into
the
intimacy
which
had
before
enclosed
only
the
three
loristan
talked
to
him
as
he
talked
to
marco
drawing
him
within
the
circle
which
held
so
much
that
was
comprehended
without
speech
the
rat
knew
that
he
was
being
trained
and
observed
and
he
realized
it
with
exaltation
his
idol
had
said
that
he
was
one
of
them
and
he
was
watching
and
putting
him
to
tests
so
that
he
might
find
out
how
much
he
was
one
of
them
and
he
was
doing
it
for
some
grave
reason
of
his
own
this
thought
possessed
the
rat
whole
mind
perhaps
he
was
wondering
if
he
should
find
out
that
he
was
to
be
trusted
as
a
rock
is
to
be
trusted
that
he
should
even
think
that
perhaps
he
might
find
that
he
was
like
a
rock
was
inspiration
enough
sir
he
said
one
night
when
they
were
alone
together
because
the
rat
had
been
copying
a
his
voice
was
very
low
do
you
think
that
sometime
you
could
trust
me
as
you
trust
marco
could
it
ever
be
like
that
ever
the
time
has
come
and
loristan
voice
was
almost
as
low
as
his
own
though
strong
and
deep
feeling
underlay
its
quiet
the
time
has
come
when
i
can
trust
you
with
marco
to
be
his
companion
to
care
for
him
to
stand
by
his
side
at
any
moment
and
marco
is
marco
is
my
son
that
was
enough
to
uplift
the
rat
to
the
skies
but
there
was
more
to
follow
it
may
not
be
long
before
it
may
be
his
part
to
do
work
in
which
he
will
need
a
comrade
who
can
be
trusted
as
a
rock
can
be
trusted
he
had
said
the
very
words
the
rat
own
mind
had
given
to
him
a
rock
a
rock
the
boy
broke
out
let
me
show
you
sir
send
me
with
him
for
a
servant
the
crutches
are
nothing
you
seen
that
they
as
good
as
legs
have
you
i
trained
myself
i
know
i
know
dear
lad
marco
had
told
him
all
of
it
he
gave
him
a
gracious
smile
which
seemed
as
if
it
held
a
sort
of
fine
secret
you
shall
go
as
his
it
shall
be
part
of
the
game
he
had
always
encouraged
the
game
and
during
the
last
weeks
had
even
found
time
to
help
them
in
their
plannings
for
the
mysterious
journey
of
the
secret
two
he
had
been
so
interested
that
once
or
twice
he
had
called
on
lazarus
as
an
old
soldier
and
samavian
to
give
his
opinions
of
certain
routes
and
of
the
customs
and
habits
of
people
in
towns
and
villages
by
the
way
here
they
would
find
simple
pastoral
folk
who
danced
sang
after
their
day
work
and
who
would
tell
all
they
knew
here
they
would
find
those
who
served
or
feared
the
maranovitch
and
who
would
not
talk
at
all
in
one
place
they
would
meet
with
hospitality
in
another
with
unfriendly
suspicion
of
all
strangers
through
talk
and
stories
the
rat
began
to
know
the
country
almost
as
marco
knew
it
that
was
part
of
the
game
too
because
it
was
always
the
game
they
called
it
another
part
was
the
rat
training
of
his
memory
and
bringing
home
his
proofs
of
advance
at
night
when
he
returned
from
his
walk
and
could
describe
or
recite
or
roughly
sketch
all
he
had
seen
in
his
passage
from
one
place
to
another
marco
part
was
to
recall
and
sketch
faces
loristan
one
night
gave
him
a
number
of
photographs
of
people
to
commit
to
memory
under
each
face
was
written
the
name
of
a
place
learn
these
faces
he
said
until
you
would
know
each
one
of
them
at
once
wheresoever
you
met
it
fix
them
upon
your
mind
so
that
it
will
be
impossible
for
you
to
forget
them
you
must
be
able
to
sketch
any
one
of
them
and
recall
the
city
or
town
or
neighborhood
connected
with
it
even
this
was
still
called
the
game
but
marco
began
to
know
in
his
secret
heart
that
it
was
so
much
more
that
his
hand
sometimes
trembled
with
excitement
as
he
made
his
sketches
over
and
over
again
to
make
each
one
many
times
was
the
best
way
to
imbed
it
in
his
memory
the
rat
knew
too
though
he
had
no
reason
for
knowing
but
mere
instinct
he
used
to
lie
awake
in
the
night
and
think
it
over
and
remember
what
loristan
had
said
of
the
time
coming
when
marco
might
need
a
comrade
in
his
work
what
was
his
work
to
be
it
was
to
be
something
like
the
game
and
they
were
being
prepared
for
it
and
though
marco
often
lay
awake
on
his
bed
when
the
rat
lay
awake
on
his
sofa
neither
boy
spoke
to
the
other
of
the
thing
his
mind
dwelt
on
and
marco
worked
as
he
had
never
worked
before
the
game
was
very
exciting
when
he
could
prove
his
prowess
the
four
gathered
together
at
night
in
the
back
lazarus
was
obliged
to
be
with
them
because
a
second
judge
was
needed
loristan
would
mention
the
name
of
a
place
perhaps
a
street
in
paris
or
a
hotel
in
vienna
and
marco
would
at
once
make
a
rapid
sketch
of
the
face
under
whose
photograph
the
name
of
the
locality
had
been
written
it
was
not
long
before
he
could
begin
his
sketch
without
more
than
a
moment
hesitation
and
yet
even
when
this
had
become
the
case
they
still
played
the
game
night
after
night
there
was
a
great
hotel
near
the
place
de
la
concorde
in
paris
of
which
marco
felt
he
should
never
hear
the
name
during
all
his
life
without
there
starting
up
before
his
mental
vision
a
tall
woman
with
fierce
black
eyes
and
a
delicate
nose
across
which
the
strong
eyebrows
almost
met
in
vienna
there
was
a
palace
which
would
always
bring
back
at
once
a
pale
man
with
a
heavy
blonde
lock
which
fell
over
his
forehead
a
certain
street
in
munich
meant
a
stout
genial
old
aristocrat
with
a
sly
smile
a
village
in
bavaria
a
peasant
with
a
vacant
and
simple
countenance
a
curled
and
smoothed
man
who
looked
like
a
brought
up
a
place
in
an
austrian
mountain
town
he
knew
them
all
as
he
knew
his
own
face
and
no
philibert
place
but
still
night
after
night
the
game
was
played
then
came
a
night
when
out
of
a
deep
sleep
he
was
awakened
by
lazarus
touching
him
he
had
so
long
been
secretly
ready
to
answer
any
call
that
he
sat
up
straight
in
bed
at
the
first
touch
dress
quickly
and
come
down
stairs
lazarus
said
the
prince
is
here
and
wishes
to
speak
with
you
marco
made
no
answer
but
got
out
of
bed
and
began
to
slip
on
his
clothes
lazarus
touched
the
rat
the
rat
was
as
ready
as
marco
and
sat
upright
as
he
had
done
come
down
with
the
young
master
he
commanded
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
be
seen
and
spoken
to
and
having
given
the
order
he
went
away
no
one
heard
the
shoeless
feet
of
the
two
boys
as
they
stole
down
the
stairs
an
elderly
man
in
ordinary
clothes
but
with
an
unmistakable
face
was
sitting
quietly
talking
to
loristan
who
with
a
gesture
called
both
forward
the
prince
has
been
much
interested
in
what
i
have
told
him
of
your
game
he
said
in
his
lowest
voice
he
wishes
to
see
you
make
your
sketches
marco
marco
looked
very
straight
into
the
prince
eyes
which
were
fixed
intently
on
him
as
he
made
his
bow
his
highness
does
me
honor
he
said
as
his
father
might
have
said
it
he
went
to
the
table
at
once
and
took
from
a
drawer
his
pencils
and
pieces
of
cardboard
i
should
know
he
was
your
son
and
a
samavian
the
prince
remarked
then
his
keen
and
eyes
turned
themselves
on
the
boy
with
the
crutches
this
said
loristan
is
the
one
who
calls
himself
the
rat
he
is
one
of
us
the
rat
saluted
please
tell
him
sir
he
whispered
that
the
crutches
do
matter
he
has
trained
himself
to
an
extraordinary
activity
loristan
said
he
can
do
anything
the
keen
eyes
were
still
taking
the
rat
in
they
are
an
advantage
said
the
prince
at
last
lazarus
had
nailed
together
a
light
rough
easel
which
marco
used
in
making
his
sketches
when
the
game
was
played
lazarus
was
standing
in
state
at
the
door
and
he
came
forward
brought
the
easel
from
its
corner
and
arranged
the
necessary
drawing
materials
upon
it
marco
stood
near
it
and
waited
the
pleasure
of
his
father
and
his
visitor
they
were
speaking
together
in
low
tones
and
he
waited
several
minutes
what
the
rat
noticed
was
what
he
had
noticed
before
that
the
big
boy
could
stand
still
in
perfect
ease
and
silence
it
was
not
necessary
for
him
to
say
things
or
to
ask
questions
to
look
at
people
as
if
he
felt
restless
if
they
did
not
speak
to
or
notice
him
he
did
not
seem
to
require
notice
and
the
rat
felt
vaguely
that
young
as
he
was
this
very
freedom
from
any
anxiety
to
be
looked
at
or
addressed
made
him
somehow
look
like
a
great
gentleman
loristan
and
the
prince
advanced
to
where
he
stood
de
marigny
loristan
said
marco
began
to
sketch
rapidly
he
began
the
portrait
of
the
handsome
woman
with
the
delicate
nose
and
the
black
brows
which
almost
met
as
he
did
it
the
prince
drew
nearer
and
watched
the
work
over
his
shoulder
it
did
not
take
very
long
and
when
it
was
finished
the
inspector
turned
and
after
giving
loristan
a
long
and
strange
look
nodded
twice
it
is
a
remarkable
thing
he
said
in
that
rough
sketch
she
is
not
to
be
mistaken
loristan
bent
his
head
then
he
mentioned
the
name
of
another
street
in
another
place
and
marco
sketched
again
this
time
it
was
the
peasant
with
the
simple
face
the
prince
bowed
again
then
loristan
gave
another
name
and
after
that
another
and
another
and
marco
did
his
work
until
it
was
at
an
end
and
lazarus
stood
near
with
a
handful
of
sketches
which
he
had
silently
taken
charge
of
as
each
was
laid
aside
you
would
know
these
faces
wheresoever
you
saw
them
said
the
prince
if
you
passed
one
in
bond
street
or
in
the
marylebone
road
you
would
recognize
it
at
once
as
i
know
yours
sir
marco
answered
then
followed
a
number
of
questions
loristan
asked
them
as
he
had
often
asked
them
before
they
were
questions
as
to
the
height
and
build
of
the
originals
of
the
pictures
of
the
color
of
their
hair
and
eyes
and
the
order
of
their
complexions
marco
answered
them
all
he
knew
all
but
the
names
of
these
people
and
it
was
plainly
not
necessary
that
he
should
know
them
as
his
father
had
never
uttered
them
after
this
questioning
was
at
an
end
the
prince
pointed
to
the
rat
who
had
leaned
on
his
crutches
against
the
wall
his
eyes
fiercely
eager
like
a
ferret
and
he
the
prince
said
what
can
he
do
let
me
try
said
the
rat
marco
knows
marco
looked
at
his
father
may
i
help
him
to
show
you
he
asked
yes
loristan
answered
and
then
as
he
turned
to
the
prince
he
said
again
in
his
low
voice
is
one
of
then
marco
began
a
new
form
of
the
game
he
held
up
one
of
the
pictured
faces
before
the
rat
and
the
rat
named
at
once
the
city
and
place
connected
with
it
he
detailed
the
color
of
eyes
and
hair
the
height
the
build
all
the
personal
details
as
marco
himself
had
detailed
them
to
these
he
added
descriptions
of
the
cities
and
points
concerning
the
police
system
the
palaces
the
people
his
face
twisted
itself
his
eyes
burned
his
voice
shook
but
he
was
amazing
in
his
readiness
of
reply
and
his
exactness
of
memory
i
ca
draw
he
said
at
the
end
but
i
can
remember
i
did
want
any
one
to
be
bothered
with
thinking
i
was
trying
to
learn
it
so
only
marco
knew
this
he
said
to
loristan
with
appeal
in
his
voice
it
was
he
who
invented
game
said
loristan
i
showed
you
his
strange
maps
and
plans
it
is
a
good
game
the
prince
answered
in
the
manner
of
a
man
extraordinarily
interested
and
impressed
they
know
it
well
they
can
be
trusted
no
such
thing
has
ever
been
done
before
loristan
said
it
is
as
new
as
it
is
daring
and
simple
therein
lies
its
safety
the
prince
answered
perhaps
only
boyhood
said
loristan
could
have
dared
to
imagine
it
the
prince
thanks
you
he
said
after
a
few
more
words
spoken
aside
to
his
visitor
we
both
thank
you
you
may
go
back
to
your
beds
and
the
boys
went
xix
that
is
one
a
week
had
not
passed
before
marco
brought
to
the
rat
in
their
bedroom
an
envelope
containing
a
number
of
slips
of
paper
on
each
of
which
was
written
something
this
is
another
part
of
the
game
he
said
gravely
let
us
sit
down
together
by
the
table
and
study
it
they
sat
down
and
examined
what
was
written
on
the
slips
at
the
head
of
each
was
the
name
of
one
of
the
places
with
which
marco
had
connected
a
face
he
had
sketched
below
were
clear
and
concise
directions
as
to
how
it
was
to
be
reached
and
the
words
to
be
said
when
each
individual
was
encountered
this
person
is
to
be
found
at
his
stall
in
the
market
was
written
of
the
peasant
you
will
first
attract
his
attention
by
asking
the
price
of
something
when
he
is
looking
at
you
touch
your
left
thumb
lightly
with
the
forefinger
of
your
right
hand
then
utter
in
a
low
distinct
tone
the
words
lamp
is
lighted
that
is
all
you
are
to
do
sometimes
the
directions
were
not
quite
so
simple
but
they
were
all
instructions
of
the
same
order
the
originals
of
the
sketches
were
to
be
sought
out
always
with
precaution
which
should
conceal
that
they
were
being
sought
at
all
and
always
in
such
a
manner
as
would
cause
an
encounter
to
appear
to
be
mere
chance
then
certain
words
were
to
be
uttered
but
always
without
attracting
the
attention
of
any
bystander
or
the
boys
worked
at
their
task
through
the
entire
day
they
concentrated
all
their
powers
upon
it
they
wrote
and
they
repeated
to
each
other
what
they
committed
to
memory
as
if
it
were
a
lesson
marco
worked
with
the
greater
ease
and
more
rapidly
because
exercise
of
this
order
had
been
his
practice
and
entertainment
from
his
babyhood
the
rat
however
almost
kept
pace
with
him
as
he
had
been
born
with
a
phenomenal
memory
and
his
eagerness
and
desire
were
a
fury
but
throughout
the
entire
day
neither
of
them
once
referred
to
what
they
were
doing
as
anything
but
the
game
at
night
it
is
true
each
found
himself
lying
awake
and
thinking
it
was
the
rat
who
broke
the
silence
from
his
sofa
it
is
what
the
messengers
of
the
secret
party
would
be
ordered
to
do
when
they
were
sent
out
to
give
the
sign
for
the
rising
he
said
i
made
that
up
the
first
day
i
invented
the
party
did
i
yes
answered
marco
after
a
third
day
concentration
they
knew
by
heart
everything
given
to
them
to
learn
that
night
loristan
put
them
through
an
examination
can
you
write
these
things
he
asked
after
each
had
repeated
them
and
emerged
safely
from
all
each
boy
wrote
them
correctly
from
memory
write
yours
in
french
in
german
in
russian
in
samavian
loristan
said
to
marco
all
you
have
told
me
to
do
and
to
learn
is
part
of
myself
father
marco
said
in
the
end
it
is
part
of
me
as
if
it
were
my
hand
or
my
eyes
or
my
heart
i
believe
that
is
true
answered
loristan
he
was
pale
that
night
and
there
was
a
shadow
on
his
face
his
eyes
held
a
great
longing
as
they
rested
on
marco
it
was
a
yearning
which
had
a
sort
of
dread
in
it
lazarus
also
did
not
seem
quite
himself
he
was
red
instead
of
pale
and
his
movements
were
uncertain
and
restless
he
cleared
his
throat
nervously
at
intervals
and
more
than
once
left
his
chair
as
if
to
look
for
something
it
was
almost
midnight
when
loristan
standing
near
marco
put
his
arm
round
his
shoulders
the
game
he
began
and
then
was
silent
a
few
moments
while
marco
felt
his
arm
tighten
its
hold
both
marco
and
the
rat
felt
a
hard
quick
beat
in
their
breasts
and
because
of
this
and
because
the
pause
seemed
long
marco
spoke
the
game
yes
father
he
said
the
game
is
about
to
give
you
work
to
do
both
of
you
loristan
answered
lazarus
cleared
his
throat
and
walked
to
the
easel
in
the
corner
of
the
room
but
he
only
changed
the
position
of
a
piece
of
on
it
and
then
came
back
in
two
days
you
are
to
go
to
paris
as
you
to
the
rat
planned
in
the
game
as
i
planned
the
rat
barely
breathed
the
words
yes
answered
loristan
the
instructions
you
have
learned
you
will
carry
out
there
is
no
more
to
be
done
than
to
manage
to
approach
certain
persons
closely
enough
to
be
able
to
utter
certain
words
to
them
only
two
young
strollers
whom
no
man
could
suspect
put
in
lazarus
in
an
astonishingly
rough
and
shaky
voice
they
could
pass
near
the
emperor
himself
without
danger
the
young
master
his
voice
became
so
hoarse
that
he
was
obligated
to
clear
it
loudly
the
young
master
must
carry
himself
less
finely
it
would
be
well
to
shuffle
a
little
and
slouch
as
if
he
were
of
the
common
people
yes
said
the
rat
hastily
he
must
do
that
i
can
teach
him
he
holds
his
head
and
his
shoulders
like
a
gentleman
he
must
look
like
a
street
lad
i
will
look
like
one
said
marco
with
determination
i
will
trust
you
to
remind
him
loristan
said
to
the
rat
and
he
said
it
with
gravity
that
will
be
your
charge
as
he
lay
upon
his
pillow
that
night
it
seemed
to
marco
as
if
a
load
had
lifted
itself
from
his
heart
it
was
the
load
of
uncertainty
and
longing
he
had
so
long
borne
the
pain
of
feeling
that
he
was
too
young
to
be
allowed
to
serve
in
any
way
his
dreams
had
never
been
wild
ones
they
had
in
fact
always
been
boyish
and
modest
howsoever
romantic
but
now
no
dream
which
could
have
passed
through
his
brain
would
have
seemed
so
wonderful
as
this
that
the
hour
had
come
the
hour
had
come
and
that
he
marco
was
to
be
its
messenger
he
was
to
do
no
dramatic
deed
and
be
announced
by
no
flourish
of
heralds
no
one
would
know
what
he
did
what
he
achieved
could
only
be
attained
if
he
remained
obscure
and
unknown
and
seemed
to
every
one
only
a
common
ordinary
boy
who
knew
nothing
whatever
of
important
things
but
his
father
had
given
to
him
a
gift
so
splendid
that
he
trembled
with
awe
and
joy
as
he
thought
of
it
the
game
had
become
real
he
and
the
rat
were
to
carry
with
them
the
sign
and
it
would
be
like
carrying
a
tiny
lamp
to
set
aflame
lights
which
would
blaze
from
one
to
another
until
half
the
world
seemed
on
fire
as
he
had
awakened
out
of
his
sleep
when
lazarus
touched
him
so
he
awakened
in
the
middle
of
the
night
again
but
he
was
not
aroused
by
a
touch
when
he
opened
his
eyes
he
knew
it
was
a
look
which
had
penetrated
his
sleep
a
look
in
the
eyes
of
his
father
who
was
standing
by
his
side
in
the
road
outside
there
was
the
utter
silence
he
had
noticed
the
night
of
the
prince
first
visit
the
only
light
was
that
of
the
lamp
in
the
street
but
he
could
see
loristan
face
clearly
enough
to
know
that
the
mere
intensity
of
his
gaze
had
awakened
him
the
rat
was
sleeping
profoundly
loristan
spoke
in
samavian
and
under
his
breath
beloved
one
he
said
you
are
very
young
because
i
am
your
father
just
at
this
hour
i
can
feel
nothing
else
i
have
trained
you
for
this
through
all
the
years
of
your
life
i
am
proud
of
your
young
maturity
and
strength
but
beloved
you
are
a
child
can
i
do
this
thing
for
the
moment
his
face
and
his
voice
were
scarcely
like
his
own
he
kneeled
by
the
bedside
and
as
he
did
it
marco
half
sitting
up
caught
his
hand
and
held
it
hard
against
his
breast
father
i
know
he
cried
under
his
breath
also
it
is
true
i
am
a
child
but
am
i
not
a
man
also
you
yourself
said
it
i
always
knew
that
you
were
teaching
me
to
be
one
for
some
reason
it
was
my
secret
that
i
knew
it
i
learned
well
because
i
never
forgot
it
and
i
learned
did
i
not
he
was
so
eager
that
he
looked
more
like
a
boy
than
ever
but
his
young
strength
and
courage
were
splendid
to
see
loristan
knew
him
through
and
through
and
read
every
boyish
thought
of
his
yes
he
answered
slowly
you
did
your
part
and
now
if
i
drew
back
you
would
feel
that
i
failed
you
failed
you
marco
breathed
it
proudly
you
not
fail
even
the
weakest
thing
in
the
world
there
was
a
moment
silence
in
which
the
two
pairs
of
eyes
dwelt
on
each
other
with
the
deepest
meaning
and
then
loristan
rose
to
his
feet
the
end
will
be
all
that
our
hearts
most
wish
he
said
you
may
begin
the
new
part
of
game
you
may
go
to
paris
when
the
train
which
was
to
meet
the
boat
that
crossed
from
dover
to
calais
steamed
out
of
the
noisy
charing
cross
station
it
carried
in
a
carriage
two
shabby
boys
one
of
them
would
have
been
a
handsome
lad
if
he
had
not
carried
himself
slouchingly
and
walked
with
a
street
lad
careless
shuffling
gait
the
other
was
a
cripple
who
moved
slowly
and
apparently
with
difficulty
on
crutches
there
was
nothing
remarkable
or
picturesque
enough
about
them
to
attract
attention
they
sat
in
the
corner
of
the
carriage
and
neither
talked
much
nor
seemed
to
be
particularly
interested
in
the
journey
or
each
other
when
they
went
on
board
the
steamer
they
were
soon
lost
among
the
commoner
passengers
and
in
fact
found
for
themselves
a
secluded
place
which
was
not
advantageous
enough
to
be
wanted
by
any
one
else
what
can
such
a
pair
of
lads
be
going
to
paris
for
some
one
asked
his
companion
not
for
pleasure
certainly
perhaps
to
get
work
was
the
casual
answer
in
the
evening
they
reached
paris
and
marco
led
the
way
to
a
small
café
in
a
where
they
got
some
cheap
food
in
the
same
they
found
a
bed
they
could
share
for
the
night
in
a
tiny
room
over
a
baker
shop
the
rat
was
too
much
excited
to
be
ready
to
go
to
bed
early
he
begged
marco
to
guide
him
about
the
brilliant
streets
they
went
slowly
along
the
broad
avenue
des
champs
elysees
under
the
lights
glittering
among
the
trees
the
rat
sharp
eyes
took
it
all
in
the
light
of
the
cafés
among
the
embowering
trees
the
many
carriages
rolling
by
the
people
who
loitered
and
laughed
or
sat
at
little
tables
drinking
wine
and
listening
to
music
the
broad
stream
of
life
which
flowed
on
to
the
arc
de
triomphe
and
back
again
it
brighter
and
clearer
than
london
he
said
to
marco
the
people
look
as
if
they
were
having
more
fun
than
they
do
in
england
the
place
de
la
concorde
spreading
its
stately
spaces
a
world
of
illumination
movement
and
majestic
beauty
held
him
as
though
by
a
fascination
he
wanted
to
stand
and
stare
at
it
first
from
one
point
of
view
and
then
from
another
it
was
bigger
and
more
wonderful
than
he
had
been
able
to
picture
it
when
marco
had
described
it
to
him
and
told
him
of
the
part
it
had
played
in
the
days
of
the
french
revolution
when
the
guillotine
had
stood
in
it
and
the
tumbrils
had
emptied
themselves
at
the
foot
of
its
steps
he
stood
near
the
obelisk
a
long
time
without
speaking
i
can
see
it
all
happening
he
said
at
last
and
he
pulled
marco
away
before
they
returned
home
they
found
their
way
to
a
large
house
which
stood
in
a
courtyard
in
the
iron
work
of
the
handsome
gates
which
shut
it
in
was
wrought
a
gilded
coronet
the
gates
were
closed
and
the
house
was
not
brightly
lighted
they
walked
past
it
and
round
it
without
speaking
but
when
they
neared
the
entrance
for
the
second
time
the
rat
said
in
a
low
tone
she
is
five
feet
seven
has
black
hair
a
nose
with
a
high
bridge
her
eyebrows
are
black
and
almost
meet
across
it
she
has
a
pale
olive
skin
and
holds
her
head
proudly
that
is
the
one
marco
answered
they
were
a
week
in
paris
and
each
day
passed
this
big
house
there
were
certain
hours
when
great
ladies
were
more
likely
to
go
out
and
come
in
than
they
were
at
others
marco
knew
this
and
they
managed
to
be
within
sight
of
the
house
or
to
pass
it
at
these
hours
for
two
days
they
saw
no
sign
of
the
person
they
wished
to
see
but
one
morning
the
gates
were
thrown
open
and
they
saw
flowers
and
palms
being
taken
in
she
has
been
away
and
is
coming
back
said
marco
the
next
day
they
passed
three
times
once
at
the
hour
when
fashionable
women
drive
out
to
do
their
shopping
once
at
the
time
when
afternoon
visiting
is
most
likely
to
begin
and
once
when
the
streets
were
brilliant
with
lights
and
the
carriages
had
begun
to
roll
by
to
and
theaters
then
as
they
stood
at
a
little
distance
from
the
iron
gates
a
carriage
drove
through
them
and
stopped
before
the
big
open
door
which
was
thrown
open
by
two
tall
footmen
in
splendid
livery
she
is
coming
out
said
the
rat
they
would
be
able
to
see
her
plainly
when
she
came
because
the
lights
over
the
entrance
were
so
bright
marco
slipped
from
under
his
coat
sleeve
a
carefully
made
sketch
he
looked
at
it
and
the
rat
looked
at
it
a
footman
stood
erect
on
each
side
of
the
open
door
the
footman
who
sat
with
the
coachman
had
got
down
and
was
waiting
by
the
carriage
marco
and
the
rat
glanced
again
with
furtive
haste
at
the
sketch
a
handsome
woman
appeared
upon
the
threshold
she
paused
and
gave
some
order
to
the
footman
who
stood
on
the
right
then
she
came
out
in
the
full
light
and
got
into
the
carriage
which
drove
out
of
the
courtyard
and
quite
near
the
place
where
the
two
boys
waited
when
it
was
gone
marco
drew
a
long
breath
as
he
tore
the
sketch
into
very
small
pieces
indeed
he
did
not
throw
them
away
but
put
them
into
his
pocket
the
rat
drew
a
long
breath
also
yes
he
said
positively
yes
said
marco
when
they
were
safely
shut
up
in
their
room
over
the
baker
shop
they
discussed
the
chances
of
their
being
able
to
pass
her
in
such
a
way
as
would
seem
accidental
two
common
boys
could
not
enter
the
courtyard
there
was
a
back
entrance
for
tradespeople
and
messengers
when
she
drove
she
would
always
enter
her
carriage
from
the
same
place
unless
she
sometimes
walked
they
could
not
approach
her
what
should
be
done
the
thing
was
difficult
after
they
had
talked
some
time
the
rat
sat
and
gnawed
his
nails
afternoon
he
broke
out
at
last
we
watch
and
see
if
her
carriage
drives
in
for
her
then
when
she
comes
to
the
door
i
go
in
and
begin
to
beg
the
servant
will
think
i
a
foreigner
and
do
know
what
i
doing
you
can
come
after
me
to
tell
me
to
come
away
because
you
know
better
than
i
do
that
i
shall
be
ordered
out
she
may
be
a
woman
and
listen
to
us
and
you
might
get
near
her
we
might
try
it
marco
answered
it
might
work
we
will
try
it
the
rat
never
failed
to
treat
him
as
his
leader
he
had
begged
loristan
to
let
him
come
with
marco
as
his
servant
and
his
servant
he
had
been
more
than
willing
to
be
when
loristan
had
said
he
should
be
his
he
had
felt
his
trust
lifted
to
a
military
dignity
which
uplifted
him
with
it
as
his
he
must
serve
him
watch
him
obey
his
lightest
wish
make
everything
easy
for
him
sometimes
marco
was
troubled
by
the
way
in
which
he
insisted
on
serving
him
this
queer
once
dictatorial
and
cantankerous
lad
who
had
begun
by
throwing
stones
at
him
you
must
not
wait
on
me
he
said
to
him
i
must
wait
upon
myself
the
rat
rather
flushed
he
told
me
that
he
would
let
me
come
with
you
as
your
camp
he
said
it
it
part
of
the
game
it
makes
things
easier
if
we
keep
up
the
game
it
would
have
attracted
attention
if
they
had
spent
too
much
time
in
the
vicinity
of
the
big
house
so
it
happened
that
the
next
afternoon
the
great
lady
evidently
drove
out
at
an
hour
when
they
were
not
watching
for
her
they
were
on
their
way
to
try
if
they
could
carry
out
their
plan
when
as
they
walked
together
along
the
rue
royale
the
rat
suddenly
touched
marco
elbow
the
carriage
stands
before
the
shop
with
lace
in
the
windows
he
whispered
hurriedly
marco
saw
and
recognized
it
at
once
the
owner
had
evidently
gone
into
the
shop
to
buy
something
this
was
a
better
chance
than
they
had
hoped
for
and
when
they
approached
the
carriage
itself
they
saw
that
there
was
another
point
in
their
favor
inside
were
no
less
than
three
beautiful
little
pekingese
spaniels
that
looked
exactly
alike
they
were
all
trying
to
look
out
of
the
window
and
were
pushing
against
each
other
they
were
so
perfect
and
so
pretty
that
few
people
passed
by
without
looking
at
them
what
better
excuse
could
two
boys
have
for
lingering
about
a
place
they
stopped
and
standing
a
little
distance
away
began
to
look
at
and
discuss
them
and
laugh
at
their
excited
little
antics
through
the
marco
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
great
lady
she
does
not
look
much
interested
she
wo
stay
long
he
whispered
and
added
aloud
that
little
one
is
the
master
see
how
he
pushes
the
others
aside
he
is
stronger
than
the
other
two
though
he
is
so
small
he
can
snap
too
said
the
rat
she
is
coming
now
warned
marco
and
then
laughed
aloud
as
if
at
the
pekingese
which
catching
sight
of
their
mistress
at
the
began
to
leap
and
yelp
for
joy
their
mistress
herself
smiled
and
was
smiling
as
marco
drew
near
her
may
we
look
at
them
madame
he
said
in
french
and
as
she
made
an
amiable
gesture
of
acquiescence
and
moved
toward
the
carriage
with
him
he
spoke
a
few
words
very
low
but
very
distinctly
in
russian
the
lamp
is
lighted
he
said
the
rat
was
looking
at
her
keenly
but
he
did
not
see
her
face
change
at
all
what
he
noticed
most
throughout
their
journey
was
that
each
person
to
whom
they
gave
the
sign
had
complete
control
over
his
or
her
countenance
if
there
were
bystanders
and
never
betrayed
by
any
change
of
expression
that
the
words
meant
anything
unusual
the
great
lady
merely
went
on
smiling
and
spoke
only
of
the
dogs
allowing
marco
and
himself
to
look
at
them
through
the
window
of
the
carriage
as
the
footman
opened
the
door
for
her
to
enter
they
are
beautiful
little
creatures
marco
said
lifting
his
cap
and
as
the
footman
turned
away
he
uttered
his
few
russian
words
once
more
and
moved
off
without
even
glancing
at
the
lady
again
that
is
he
said
to
the
rat
that
night
before
they
went
to
sleep
and
with
a
match
he
burned
the
scraps
of
the
sketch
he
had
torn
and
put
into
his
pocket
xx
marco
goes
to
the
opera
their
next
journey
was
to
munich
but
the
night
before
they
left
paris
an
unexpected
thing
happened
to
reach
the
narrow
staircase
which
led
to
their
bedroom
it
was
necessary
to
pass
through
the
baker
shop
itself
the
baker
wife
was
a
friendly
woman
who
liked
the
two
boy
lodgers
who
were
so
quiet
and
gave
no
trouble
more
than
once
she
had
given
them
a
hot
roll
or
so
or
a
freshly
baked
little
tartlet
with
fruit
in
the
center
when
marco
came
in
this
evening
she
greeted
him
with
a
nod
and
handed
him
a
small
parcel
as
he
passed
through
this
was
left
for
you
this
afternoon
she
said
i
see
you
are
making
purchases
for
your
journey
my
man
and
i
are
very
sorry
you
are
going
thank
you
madame
we
also
are
sorry
marco
answered
taking
the
parcel
they
are
not
large
purchases
you
see
but
neither
he
nor
the
rat
had
bought
anything
at
all
though
the
little
package
was
plainly
addressed
to
him
and
bore
the
name
of
one
of
the
big
cheap
shops
it
felt
as
if
it
contained
something
soft
when
he
reached
their
bedroom
the
rat
was
gazing
out
of
the
window
watching
every
living
thing
which
passed
in
the
street
below
he
who
had
never
seen
anything
but
london
was
absorbed
by
the
spell
of
paris
and
was
learning
it
by
heart
something
has
been
sent
to
us
look
at
this
said
marco
the
rat
was
at
his
side
at
once
what
is
it
where
did
it
come
from
they
opened
the
package
and
at
first
sight
saw
only
several
pairs
of
quite
common
woolen
socks
as
marco
took
up
the
sock
in
the
middle
of
the
parcel
he
felt
that
there
was
something
inside
it
something
laid
flat
and
carefully
he
put
his
hand
in
and
drew
out
a
number
of
notes
not
new
ones
because
new
ones
would
have
betrayed
themselves
by
crackling
these
were
old
enough
to
be
soft
but
there
were
enough
of
them
to
amount
to
a
substantial
sum
it
is
in
small
notes
because
poor
boys
would
have
only
small
ones
no
one
will
be
surprised
when
we
change
these
the
rat
said
each
of
them
believed
the
package
had
been
sent
by
the
great
lady
but
it
had
been
done
so
carefully
that
not
the
slightest
clue
was
furnished
to
the
rat
part
of
the
deep
excitement
of
the
game
was
the
working
out
of
the
plans
and
methods
of
each
person
concerned
he
could
not
have
slept
without
working
out
some
scheme
which
might
have
been
used
in
this
case
it
thrilled
him
to
contemplate
the
difficulties
the
great
lady
might
have
found
herself
obliged
to
overcome
perhaps
he
said
after
thinking
it
over
for
some
time
she
went
to
a
big
common
shop
dressed
as
if
she
were
an
ordinary
woman
and
bought
the
socks
and
pretended
she
was
going
to
carry
them
home
herself
she
would
do
that
so
that
she
could
take
them
into
some
corner
and
slip
the
money
in
then
as
she
wanted
to
have
them
sent
from
the
shop
perhaps
she
bought
some
other
things
and
asked
the
people
to
deliver
the
packages
to
different
places
the
socks
were
sent
to
us
and
the
other
things
to
some
one
else
she
would
go
to
a
shop
where
no
one
knew
her
and
no
one
would
expect
to
see
her
and
she
would
wear
clothes
which
looked
neither
rich
nor
too
poor
he
created
the
whole
episode
with
all
its
details
and
explained
them
to
marco
it
fascinated
him
for
the
entire
evening
and
he
felt
relieved
after
it
and
slept
well
even
before
they
had
left
london
certain
newspapers
had
swept
out
of
existence
the
story
of
the
descendant
of
the
lost
prince
this
had
been
done
by
derision
and
light
handling
by
treating
it
as
a
romantic
legend
at
first
the
rat
had
resented
this
bitterly
but
one
day
at
a
meal
when
he
had
been
producing
arguments
to
prove
that
the
story
must
be
a
true
one
loristan
somehow
checked
him
by
his
own
silence
if
there
is
such
a
man
he
said
after
a
pause
it
is
well
for
him
that
his
existence
should
not
be
believed
in
for
some
time
at
least
the
rat
came
to
a
dead
stop
he
felt
hot
for
a
moment
and
then
felt
cold
he
saw
a
new
idea
all
at
once
he
had
been
making
a
mistake
in
tactics
no
more
was
said
but
when
they
were
alone
afterwards
he
poured
himself
forth
to
marco
i
was
a
fool
he
cried
out
why
could
i
see
it
for
myself
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
believe
has
been
done
there
is
some
one
who
has
influence
in
england
and
who
is
a
friend
to
samavia
they
got
the
newspapers
to
make
fun
of
the
story
so
that
it
wo
be
believed
if
it
was
believed
both
the
iarovitch
and
the
maranovitch
would
be
on
the
lookout
and
the
secret
party
would
lose
their
chances
what
a
fool
i
was
not
to
think
of
it
there
some
one
watching
and
working
here
who
is
a
friend
to
samavia
but
there
is
some
one
in
samavia
who
has
begun
to
suspect
that
it
might
be
true
marco
answered
if
there
were
not
i
should
not
have
been
shut
in
the
cellar
some
one
thought
my
father
knew
something
the
spies
had
orders
to
find
out
what
it
was
yes
yes
that
true
too
the
rat
answered
anxiously
we
shall
have
to
be
very
careful
in
the
lining
of
the
sleeve
of
marco
coat
there
was
a
slit
into
which
he
could
slip
any
small
thing
he
wished
to
conceal
and
also
wished
to
be
able
to
reach
without
trouble
in
this
he
had
carried
the
sketch
of
the
lady
which
he
had
torn
up
in
paris
when
they
walked
in
the
streets
of
munich
the
morning
after
their
arrival
he
carried
still
another
sketch
it
was
the
one
picturing
the
old
aristocrat
with
the
sly
smile
one
of
the
things
they
had
learned
about
this
one
was
that
his
chief
characteristic
was
his
passion
for
music
he
was
a
patron
of
musicians
and
he
spent
much
time
in
munich
because
he
loved
its
musical
atmosphere
and
the
earnestness
of
its
the
military
band
plays
in
the
at
midday
when
something
very
good
is
being
played
sometimes
people
stop
their
carriages
so
that
they
can
listen
we
will
go
there
said
marco
it
a
chance
said
the
rat
we
must
lose
anything
like
a
chance
the
day
was
brilliant
and
sunny
the
people
passing
through
the
streets
looked
comfortable
and
homely
the
mixture
of
old
streets
and
modern
ones
of
ancient
corners
and
shops
and
houses
of
the
day
was
picturesque
and
cheerful
the
rat
swinging
through
the
crowd
on
his
crutches
was
full
of
interest
and
exhilaration
he
had
begun
to
grow
and
the
change
in
his
face
and
expression
which
had
begun
in
london
had
become
more
noticeable
he
had
been
given
his
place
and
a
work
to
do
which
entitled
him
to
hold
it
no
one
could
have
suspected
them
of
carrying
a
strange
and
vital
secret
with
them
as
they
strolled
along
together
they
seemed
only
two
ordinary
boys
who
looked
in
at
shop
windows
and
talked
over
their
contents
and
who
loitered
with
upturned
faces
in
the
before
the
ornate
gothic
rathaus
to
hear
the
eleven
chimes
play
and
see
the
painted
figures
of
the
king
and
queen
watch
from
their
balcony
the
passing
before
them
of
the
automatic
tournament
procession
with
its
trumpeters
and
tilting
knights
when
the
show
was
over
and
the
automatic
cock
broke
forth
into
his
lusty
farewell
crow
they
laughed
just
as
any
other
boys
would
have
laughed
sometimes
it
would
have
been
easy
for
the
rat
to
forget
that
there
was
anything
graver
in
the
world
than
the
new
places
and
new
wonders
he
was
seeing
as
if
he
were
a
wandering
minstrel
in
a
story
but
in
samavia
bloody
battles
were
being
fought
and
bloody
plans
were
being
wrought
out
and
in
anguished
anxiety
the
secret
party
and
the
forgers
of
the
sword
waited
breathlessly
for
the
sign
for
which
they
had
waited
so
long
and
inside
the
lining
of
marco
coat
was
hidden
the
sketched
face
as
the
two
unnoticed
lads
made
their
way
to
the
to
hear
the
band
play
and
see
who
might
chance
to
be
among
the
audience
because
the
day
was
sunny
and
also
because
the
band
was
playing
a
specially
fine
programme
the
crowd
in
the
square
was
larger
than
usual
several
vehicles
had
stopped
and
among
them
were
one
or
two
which
were
not
merely
hired
cabs
but
were
the
carriages
of
private
persons
one
of
them
had
evidently
arrived
early
as
it
was
drawn
up
in
a
good
position
when
the
boys
reached
the
corner
it
was
a
big
open
carriage
and
a
grand
one
luxuriously
upholstered
in
green
the
footman
and
coachman
wore
green
and
silver
liveries
and
seemed
to
know
that
people
were
looking
at
them
and
their
master
he
was
a
stout
old
aristocrat
with
a
sly
smile
though
as
he
listened
to
the
music
it
almost
forgot
to
be
sly
in
the
carriage
with
him
were
a
young
officer
and
a
little
boy
and
they
also
listened
attentively
standing
near
the
carriage
door
were
several
people
who
were
plainly
friends
or
acquaintances
as
they
occasionally
spoke
to
him
marco
touched
the
rat
coat
sleeve
as
the
two
boys
approached
it
would
not
be
easy
to
get
near
him
he
said
let
us
go
and
stand
as
close
to
the
carriage
as
we
can
get
without
pushing
perhaps
we
may
hear
some
one
say
something
about
where
he
is
going
after
the
music
is
over
yes
there
was
no
mistaking
him
he
was
the
right
man
each
of
them
knew
by
heart
the
creases
on
his
stout
face
and
the
sweep
of
his
gray
moustache
but
there
was
nothing
noticeable
in
a
boy
looking
for
a
moment
at
a
piece
of
paper
and
marco
sauntered
a
few
steps
to
a
bit
of
space
left
bare
by
the
crowd
and
took
a
last
glance
at
his
sketch
his
rule
was
to
make
sure
at
the
final
moment
the
music
was
very
good
and
the
group
about
the
carriage
was
evidently
enthusiastic
there
was
talk
and
praise
and
comment
and
the
old
aristocrat
nodded
his
head
repeatedly
in
applause
the
chancellor
is
music
mad
a
near
the
boys
said
to
another
at
the
opera
every
night
unless
serious
affairs
keep
him
away
there
you
may
see
him
nodding
his
old
head
and
bursting
his
gloves
with
applauding
when
a
good
thing
is
done
he
ought
to
have
led
an
orchestra
or
played
a
he
is
too
big
for
first
violin
there
was
a
group
about
the
carriage
to
the
last
when
the
music
came
to
an
end
and
it
drove
away
there
had
been
no
possible
opportunity
of
passing
close
to
it
even
had
the
presence
of
the
young
officer
and
the
boy
not
presented
an
insurmountable
obstacle
marco
and
the
rat
went
on
their
way
and
passed
by
the
and
read
the
bills
tristan
and
isolde
was
to
be
presented
at
night
and
a
great
singer
would
sing
he
will
go
to
hear
that
both
boys
said
at
once
he
will
be
sure
to
go
it
was
decided
between
them
that
marco
should
go
on
his
quest
alone
when
night
came
one
boy
who
hung
around
the
entrance
of
the
opera
would
be
observed
less
than
two
people
notice
crutches
more
than
they
notice
legs
the
rat
said
better
keep
out
of
the
way
unless
you
need
me
my
time
has
come
yet
even
if
it
does
come
at
all
i
i
been
on
duty
i
gone
with
you
and
i
been
ready
that
what
an
does
he
stayed
at
home
and
read
such
english
papers
as
he
could
lay
hands
on
and
he
drew
plans
and
battles
on
paper
marco
went
to
the
opera
even
if
he
had
not
known
his
way
to
the
square
near
the
place
where
the
stood
he
could
easily
have
found
it
by
following
the
groups
of
people
in
the
streets
who
all
seemed
walking
in
one
direction
there
were
students
in
their
odd
caps
walking
three
or
four
abreast
there
were
young
couples
and
older
ones
and
here
and
there
whole
families
there
were
soldiers
of
all
ages
officers
and
privates
and
when
talk
was
to
be
heard
in
passing
it
was
always
talk
about
music
for
some
time
marco
waited
in
the
square
and
watched
the
carriages
roll
up
and
pass
under
the
huge
pillared
portico
to
deposit
their
contents
at
the
entrance
and
at
once
drive
away
in
orderly
sequence
he
must
make
sure
that
the
grand
carriage
with
the
green
and
silver
liveries
rolled
up
with
the
rest
if
it
came
he
would
buy
a
cheap
ticket
and
go
inside
it
was
rather
late
when
it
arrived
people
in
munich
are
not
late
for
the
opera
if
it
can
be
helped
and
the
coachman
drove
up
hurriedly
the
green
and
silver
footman
leaped
to
the
ground
and
opened
the
carriage
door
almost
before
it
stopped
the
chancellor
got
out
looking
less
genial
than
usual
because
he
was
afraid
that
he
might
lose
some
of
the
overture
a
girl
in
a
white
frock
was
with
him
and
she
was
evidently
trying
to
soothe
him
i
do
not
think
we
are
really
late
father
she
said
do
feel
cross
dear
it
will
spoil
the
music
for
you
this
was
not
a
time
in
which
a
man
attention
could
be
attracted
quietly
marco
ran
to
get
the
ticket
which
would
give
him
a
place
among
the
rows
of
young
soldiers
artists
male
and
female
students
and
musicians
who
were
willing
to
stand
four
or
five
deep
throughout
the
performance
of
even
the
longest
opera
he
knew
that
unless
they
were
in
one
of
the
few
boxes
which
belonged
only
to
the
court
the
chancellor
and
his
daughter
would
be
in
the
best
seats
in
the
front
curve
of
the
balcony
which
were
the
most
desirable
of
the
house
he
soon
saw
them
they
had
secured
the
central
places
directly
below
the
large
royal
box
where
two
quiet
princesses
and
their
attendants
were
already
seated
when
he
found
he
was
not
too
late
to
hear
the
overture
the
face
become
more
genial
than
ever
he
settled
himself
down
to
an
evening
of
enjoyment
and
evidently
forgot
everything
else
in
the
world
marco
did
not
lose
sight
of
him
when
the
audience
went
out
between
acts
to
promenade
in
the
corridors
he
might
go
also
and
there
might
be
a
chance
to
pass
near
to
him
in
the
crowd
he
watched
him
closely
sometimes
his
fine
old
face
saddened
at
the
beautiful
woe
of
the
music
sometimes
it
looked
enraptured
and
it
was
always
evident
that
every
note
reached
his
soul
the
pretty
daughter
who
sat
beside
him
was
attentive
but
not
so
enthralled
after
the
first
act
two
glittering
young
officers
appeared
and
made
elegant
and
low
bows
drawing
their
heels
together
as
they
kissed
her
hand
they
looked
sorry
when
they
were
obliged
to
return
to
their
seats
again
after
the
second
act
the
chancellor
sat
for
a
few
minutes
as
if
he
were
in
a
dream
the
people
in
the
seats
near
him
began
to
rise
from
their
seats
and
file
out
into
the
corridors
the
young
officers
were
to
be
seen
rising
also
the
rosy
daughter
leaned
forward
and
touched
her
father
arm
gently
she
wants
him
to
take
her
out
marco
thought
he
will
take
her
because
he
is
he
saw
him
recall
himself
from
his
dream
with
a
smile
and
then
he
rose
and
after
helping
to
arrange
a
silvery
blue
scarf
round
the
shoulders
gave
her
his
arm
just
as
marco
skipped
out
of
his
it
was
a
rather
warm
night
and
the
corridors
were
full
by
the
time
marco
had
reached
the
balcony
floor
the
pair
had
issued
from
the
little
door
and
were
temporarily
lost
in
the
moving
numbers
marco
quietly
made
his
way
among
the
crowd
trying
to
look
as
if
he
belonged
to
somebody
once
or
twice
his
strong
body
and
his
dense
black
eyes
and
lashes
made
people
glance
at
him
but
he
was
not
the
only
boy
who
had
been
brought
to
the
opera
so
he
felt
safe
enough
to
stop
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
watch
those
who
went
up
and
those
who
passed
by
such
a
miscellaneous
crowd
as
it
was
made
up
of
good
unfashionable
mixed
here
and
there
with
grand
people
of
the
court
and
the
gay
world
suddenly
he
heard
a
low
laugh
and
a
moment
later
a
hand
lightly
touched
him
you
get
out
then
a
soft
voice
said
when
he
turned
he
felt
his
muscles
stiffen
he
ceased
to
slouch
and
did
not
smile
as
he
looked
at
the
speaker
what
he
felt
was
a
wave
of
fierce
and
haughty
anger
it
swept
over
him
before
he
had
time
to
control
it
a
lovely
person
who
seemed
swathed
in
several
shades
of
soft
violet
drapery
was
smiling
at
him
with
long
lovely
eyes
it
was
the
woman
who
had
trapped
him
into
no
brandon
terrace
xxi
help
did
it
take
you
so
long
to
find
it
asked
the
lovely
person
with
the
smile
of
course
i
knew
you
would
find
it
in
the
end
but
we
had
to
give
ourselves
time
how
long
did
it
take
marco
removed
himself
from
beneath
the
touch
of
her
hand
it
was
quietly
done
but
there
was
a
disdain
in
his
young
face
which
made
her
wince
though
she
pretended
to
shrug
her
shoulders
amusedly
you
refuse
to
answer
she
laughed
i
refuse
at
that
very
moment
he
saw
at
the
curve
of
the
corridor
the
chancellor
and
his
daughter
approaching
slowly
the
two
young
officers
were
talking
gaily
to
the
girl
they
were
on
their
way
back
to
their
box
was
he
going
to
lose
them
was
he
the
delicate
hand
was
laid
on
his
shoulder
again
but
this
time
he
felt
that
it
grasped
him
firmly
naughty
boy
the
soft
voice
said
i
am
going
to
take
you
home
with
me
if
you
struggle
i
shall
tell
these
people
that
you
are
my
bad
boy
who
is
here
without
permission
what
will
you
answer
my
escort
is
coming
down
the
staircase
and
will
help
me
do
you
see
and
in
fact
there
appeared
in
the
crowd
at
the
head
of
the
staircase
the
figure
of
the
man
he
remembered
he
did
see
a
dampness
broke
out
on
the
palms
of
his
hands
if
she
did
this
bold
thing
what
could
he
say
to
those
she
told
her
lie
to
how
could
he
bring
proof
or
explain
who
he
was
and
what
story
dare
he
tell
his
protestations
and
struggles
would
merely
amuse
the
who
would
see
in
them
only
the
impotent
rage
of
an
insubordinate
youngster
there
swept
over
him
a
wave
of
remembrance
which
brought
back
as
if
he
were
living
through
it
again
the
moment
when
he
had
stood
in
the
darkness
of
the
wine
cellar
with
his
back
against
the
door
and
heard
the
man
walk
away
and
leave
him
alone
he
felt
again
as
he
had
done
then
but
now
he
was
in
another
land
and
far
away
from
his
father
he
could
do
nothing
to
help
himself
unless
something
showed
him
a
way
he
made
no
sound
and
the
woman
who
held
him
saw
only
a
flame
leap
under
his
dense
black
lashes
but
something
within
him
called
out
it
was
as
if
he
heard
it
it
was
that
strong
self
the
self
that
was
marco
and
it
called
it
called
as
if
it
shouted
help
it
called
to
that
unknown
stranger
thing
which
had
made
worlds
and
which
he
and
his
father
so
often
talked
of
and
in
whose
power
they
so
believed
help
the
chancellor
was
drawing
nearer
perhaps
should
he
you
are
too
proud
to
kick
and
shout
the
voice
went
on
and
people
would
only
laugh
do
you
see
the
stairs
were
crowded
and
the
man
who
was
at
the
head
of
them
could
only
move
slowly
but
he
had
seen
the
boy
marco
turned
so
that
he
could
face
his
captor
squarely
as
if
he
were
going
to
say
something
in
answer
to
her
but
he
was
not
even
as
he
made
the
movement
of
turning
the
help
he
had
called
for
came
and
he
knew
what
he
should
do
and
he
could
do
two
things
at
once
save
himself
and
give
his
sign
because
the
sign
once
given
the
chancellor
would
understand
he
will
be
here
in
a
moment
he
has
recognized
you
the
woman
said
as
he
glanced
up
the
stairs
the
delicate
grip
of
her
hand
unconsciously
slackened
marco
whirled
away
from
her
the
bell
rang
which
was
to
warn
the
audience
that
they
must
return
to
their
seats
and
he
saw
the
chancellor
hasten
his
pace
a
moment
later
the
old
aristocrat
found
himself
amazedly
looking
down
at
the
pale
face
of
a
breathless
lad
who
spoke
to
him
in
german
and
in
such
a
manner
that
he
could
not
but
pause
and
listen
sir
he
was
saying
the
woman
in
violet
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
is
a
spy
she
trapped
me
once
and
she
threatens
to
do
it
again
sir
may
i
beg
you
to
protect
me
he
said
it
low
and
fast
no
one
else
could
hear
his
words
what
what
the
chancellor
exclaimed
and
then
drawing
a
step
nearer
and
quite
as
low
and
rapidly
but
with
perfect
distinctness
marco
uttered
four
words
the
lamp
is
lighted
the
help
cry
had
been
answered
instantly
marco
saw
it
at
once
in
the
old
man
eyes
notwithstanding
that
he
turned
to
look
at
the
woman
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
as
if
she
only
concerned
him
what
what
he
said
again
and
made
a
movement
toward
her
pulling
his
large
moustache
with
a
fierce
hand
then
marco
recognized
that
a
curious
thing
happened
the
lovely
person
saw
the
movement
and
the
gray
moustache
and
that
instant
her
smile
died
away
and
she
turned
quite
white
so
white
that
under
the
brilliant
electric
light
she
was
almost
green
and
scarcely
looked
lovely
at
all
she
made
a
sign
to
the
man
on
the
staircase
and
slipped
through
the
crowd
like
an
eel
she
was
a
slim
flexible
creature
and
never
was
a
disappearance
more
wonderful
in
its
rapidity
between
stout
matrons
and
their
thin
or
stout
escorts
and
families
she
made
her
way
and
lost
herself
but
always
making
toward
the
exit
in
two
minutes
there
was
no
sight
of
her
violet
draperies
to
be
seen
she
was
gone
and
so
evidently
was
her
male
companion
it
was
plain
to
marco
that
to
follow
the
profession
of
a
spy
was
not
by
any
means
a
safe
thing
the
chancellor
had
recognized
her
she
had
recognized
the
chancellor
who
turned
looking
ferociously
angry
and
spoke
to
one
of
the
young
officers
she
and
the
man
with
her
are
two
of
the
most
dangerous
spies
in
europe
she
is
a
rumanian
and
he
is
a
russian
what
they
wanted
of
this
innocent
lad
i
do
pretend
to
know
what
did
she
threaten
to
marco
marco
was
feeling
rather
cold
and
sick
and
had
lost
his
healthy
color
for
the
moment
she
said
she
meant
to
take
me
home
with
her
and
would
pretend
i
was
her
son
who
had
come
here
without
permission
he
answered
she
believes
i
know
something
i
do
not
he
made
a
hesitating
but
grateful
bow
the
third
act
sir
i
must
not
keep
you
thank
you
thank
you
the
chancellor
moved
toward
the
entrance
door
of
the
balcony
seats
but
he
did
it
with
his
hand
on
marco
shoulder
see
that
he
gets
home
safely
he
said
to
the
younger
of
the
two
officers
send
a
messenger
with
him
he
young
to
be
attacked
by
creatures
of
that
kind
polite
young
officers
naturally
obey
the
commands
of
chancellors
and
such
dignitaries
this
one
found
without
trouble
a
young
private
who
marched
with
marco
through
the
deserted
streets
to
his
lodgings
he
was
a
stolid
young
bavarian
peasant
and
seemed
to
have
no
curiosity
or
even
any
interest
in
the
reason
for
the
command
given
him
he
was
in
fact
thinking
of
his
sweetheart
who
lived
near
konigsee
and
who
had
skated
with
him
on
the
frozen
lake
last
winter
he
scarcely
gave
a
glance
to
the
schoolboy
he
was
to
escort
he
neither
knew
nor
wondered
why
the
rat
had
fallen
asleep
over
his
papers
and
lay
with
his
head
on
his
folded
arms
on
the
table
but
he
was
awakened
by
marco
coming
into
the
room
and
sat
up
blinking
his
eyes
in
the
effort
to
get
them
open
did
you
see
him
did
you
get
near
enough
he
drowsed
yes
marco
answered
i
got
near
enough
the
rat
sat
upright
suddenly
it
not
been
easy
he
exclaimed
i
sure
something
happened
something
went
wrong
something
nearly
went
wrong
nearly
answered
marco
but
as
he
spoke
he
took
the
sketch
of
the
chancellor
out
of
the
slit
in
his
sleeve
and
tore
it
and
burned
it
with
a
match
but
i
did
get
near
enough
and
that
they
talked
long
before
they
went
to
sleep
that
night
the
rat
grew
pale
as
he
listened
to
the
story
of
the
woman
in
violet
i
ought
to
have
gone
with
you
he
said
i
see
now
an
must
always
be
in
attendance
it
would
have
been
harder
for
her
to
manage
two
than
one
i
must
always
be
near
to
watch
even
if
i
am
not
close
by
you
if
you
had
not
come
back
if
you
had
not
come
back
he
struck
his
clenched
hands
together
fiercely
what
should
i
have
done
when
marco
turned
toward
him
from
the
table
near
which
he
was
standing
he
looked
like
his
father
you
would
have
gone
on
with
the
game
just
as
far
as
you
could
he
said
you
could
not
leave
it
you
remember
the
places
and
the
faces
and
the
sign
there
is
some
money
and
when
it
was
all
gone
you
could
have
begged
as
we
used
to
pretend
we
should
we
have
not
had
to
do
it
yet
and
it
was
best
to
save
it
for
country
places
and
villages
but
you
could
have
done
it
if
you
were
obliged
to
the
game
would
have
to
go
on
the
rat
caught
at
his
thin
chest
as
if
he
had
been
struck
breathless
without
you
he
gasped
without
you
yes
said
marco
and
we
must
think
of
it
and
plan
in
case
anything
like
that
should
happen
he
stopped
himself
quite
suddenly
and
sat
down
looking
straight
before
him
as
if
at
some
far
away
thing
he
saw
nothing
will
happen
he
said
nothing
can
what
are
you
thinking
of
the
rat
gulped
because
his
breath
had
not
quite
come
back
why
will
nothing
happen
because
the
boy
spoke
in
an
almost
tone
in
quite
an
unexalted
tone
at
all
events
you
see
i
can
always
make
a
strong
call
as
i
did
tonight
did
you
shout
the
rat
asked
i
did
know
you
shouted
i
did
i
said
nothing
aloud
but
i
the
myself
that
is
in
me
marco
touched
himself
on
the
breast
called
out
help
with
all
its
strength
and
help
came
the
rat
regarded
him
dubiously
what
did
it
call
to
he
asked
to
the
power
to
the
to
the
thought
that
does
things
the
buddhist
hermit
who
told
my
father
about
it
called
it
thought
that
thought
the
world
a
reluctant
suspicion
betrayed
itself
in
the
rat
eyes
do
you
mean
you
prayed
he
inquired
with
a
slight
touch
of
disfavor
marco
eyes
remained
fixed
upon
him
in
vague
thoughtfulness
for
a
moment
or
so
of
pause
i
do
know
he
said
at
last
perhaps
it
the
same
thing
when
you
need
something
so
much
that
you
cry
out
loud
for
it
but
it
not
words
it
a
strong
thing
without
a
name
i
called
like
that
when
i
was
shut
in
the
i
remembered
some
of
the
things
the
old
buddhist
told
my
father
the
rat
moved
restlessly
the
help
came
that
time
he
admitted
how
did
it
come
in
that
thought
which
flashed
into
my
mind
almost
the
next
second
it
came
like
lightning
all
at
once
i
knew
if
i
ran
to
the
chancellor
and
said
the
woman
was
a
spy
it
would
startle
him
into
listening
to
me
and
that
then
i
could
give
him
the
sign
and
that
when
i
gave
him
the
sign
he
would
know
i
was
speaking
the
truth
and
would
protect
me
it
was
a
splendid
thought
the
rat
said
and
it
was
quick
but
it
was
you
who
thought
of
it
all
thinking
is
part
of
the
big
thought
said
marco
slowly
it
it
and
the
outside
part
of
us
somehow
broke
the
chain
that
linked
us
to
it
and
we
are
always
trying
to
mend
the
chain
without
knowing
it
that
is
what
our
thinking
is
trying
to
mend
the
chain
but
we
shall
find
out
how
to
do
it
sometime
the
old
buddhist
told
my
father
so
just
as
the
sun
was
rising
from
behind
a
high
peak
of
the
himalayas
then
he
added
hastily
i
am
only
telling
you
what
my
father
told
me
and
he
only
told
me
what
the
old
hermit
told
him
does
your
father
believe
what
he
told
him
the
rat
bewilderment
had
become
an
eager
and
restless
thing
yes
he
believes
it
he
always
thought
something
like
it
himself
that
is
why
he
is
so
calm
and
knows
so
well
how
to
wait
is
it
breathed
the
rat
is
that
why
has
has
he
mended
the
chain
and
there
was
awe
in
his
voice
because
of
this
one
man
to
whom
he
felt
any
achievement
was
possible
i
believe
he
has
said
marco
do
you
think
so
yourself
he
has
done
something
the
rat
said
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
things
over
before
he
spoke
again
and
then
even
more
slowly
than
marco
if
he
could
mend
the
chain
he
said
almost
in
a
whisper
he
could
find
out
where
the
descendant
of
the
lost
prince
is
he
would
know
what
to
do
for
samavia
he
ended
the
words
with
a
start
and
his
whole
face
glowed
with
a
new
amazed
light
perhaps
he
does
know
he
cried
if
the
help
comes
like
thoughts
as
yours
did
perhaps
his
thought
of
letting
us
give
the
sign
was
part
of
it
we
just
we
two
boys
are
part
of
it
the
old
buddhist
said
began
marco
look
here
broke
in
the
rat
tell
me
the
whole
story
i
want
to
hear
it
it
was
because
loristan
had
heard
it
and
listened
and
believed
that
the
rat
had
taken
fire
his
imagination
seized
upon
the
idea
as
it
would
have
seized
on
some
theory
of
necromancy
proved
true
and
workable
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
his
hands
in
his
hair
he
leaned
forward
twisting
a
lock
with
restless
fingers
his
breath
quickened
tell
it
he
said
i
want
to
hear
it
all
i
shall
have
to
tell
it
in
my
own
words
marco
said
and
it
wo
be
as
wonderful
as
it
was
when
my
father
told
it
to
me
this
is
what
i
remember
my
father
had
gone
through
much
pain
and
trouble
a
great
load
was
upon
him
and
he
had
been
told
he
was
going
to
die
before
his
work
was
done
he
had
gone
to
india
because
a
man
he
was
obliged
to
speak
to
had
gone
there
to
hunt
and
no
one
knew
when
he
would
return
my
father
followed
him
for
months
from
one
wild
place
to
another
and
when
he
found
him
the
man
would
not
hear
or
believe
what
he
had
come
so
far
to
say
then
he
had
and
almost
died
once
the
natives
left
him
for
dead
in
a
bungalow
in
the
forest
and
he
heard
the
jackals
howling
round
him
all
the
night
through
all
the
hours
he
was
only
alive
enough
to
be
conscious
of
two
things
all
the
rest
of
him
seemed
gone
from
his
body
his
thought
knew
that
his
work
was
unfinished
and
his
body
heard
the
jackals
howl
was
the
work
for
samavia
the
rat
put
in
quickly
if
he
had
died
that
night
the
descendant
of
the
lost
prince
never
would
have
been
found
never
the
rat
bit
his
lip
so
hard
that
a
drop
of
blood
started
from
it
when
he
was
slowly
coming
alive
again
a
native
who
had
gone
back
and
stayed
to
wait
upon
him
told
him
that
near
the
summit
of
a
mountain
about
fifty
miles
away
there
was
a
ledge
which
jutted
out
into
space
and
hung
over
the
valley
which
was
thousands
of
feet
below
on
the
ledge
there
was
a
hut
in
which
there
lived
an
ancient
buddhist
who
was
a
holy
man
as
they
called
him
and
who
had
been
there
during
time
which
had
not
been
measured
they
said
that
their
grandparents
and
had
known
of
him
though
very
few
persons
had
ever
seen
him
it
was
told
that
the
most
savage
beast
was
tame
before
him
they
said
that
a
tiger
would
stop
to
salute
him
and
that
a
thirsty
lioness
would
bring
her
whelps
to
drink
at
the
spring
near
his
hut
that
was
a
lie
said
the
rat
promptly
marco
neither
laughed
nor
frowned
how
do
we
he
said
it
was
a
native
story
and
it
might
be
anything
my
father
neither
said
it
was
true
nor
false
he
listened
to
all
that
was
told
him
by
natives
they
said
that
the
holy
man
was
the
brother
of
the
stars
he
knew
all
things
past
and
to
come
and
could
heal
the
sick
but
most
people
especially
those
who
had
sinful
thoughts
were
afraid
to
go
near
him
i
like
to
have
seen
the
rat
pondered
aloud
but
he
did
not
finish
before
my
father
was
well
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
travel
to
the
ledge
if
he
could
he
felt
as
if
he
must
go
he
thought
that
if
he
were
going
to
die
the
hermit
might
tell
him
some
wise
thing
to
do
for
samavia
he
might
have
given
him
a
message
to
leave
to
the
secret
ones
said
the
rat
he
was
so
weak
when
he
set
out
on
his
journey
that
he
wondered
if
he
would
reach
the
end
of
it
part
of
the
way
he
traveled
by
bullock
cart
and
part
he
was
carried
by
natives
but
at
last
the
bearers
came
to
a
place
more
than
halfway
up
the
mountain
and
would
go
no
further
then
they
went
back
and
left
him
to
climb
the
rest
of
the
way
himself
they
had
traveled
slowly
and
he
had
got
more
strength
but
he
was
weak
yet
the
forest
was
more
wonderful
than
anything
he
had
ever
seen
there
were
tropical
trees
with
foliage
like
lace
and
some
with
huge
leaves
and
some
of
them
seemed
to
reach
the
sky
sometimes
he
could
barely
see
gleams
of
blue
through
them
and
vines
swung
down
from
their
high
branches
and
caught
each
other
and
matted
together
and
there
were
hot
scents
and
strange
flowers
and
dazzling
birds
darting
about
and
thick
moss
and
little
cascades
bursting
out
the
path
grew
narrower
and
steeper
and
the
flower
scents
and
the
sultriness
made
it
like
walking
in
a
hothouse
he
heard
rustlings
in
the
undergrowth
which
might
have
been
made
by
any
kind
of
wild
animal
once
he
stepped
across
a
deadly
snake
without
seeing
it
but
it
was
asleep
and
did
not
hurt
him
he
knew
the
natives
had
been
convinced
that
he
would
not
reach
the
ledge
but
for
some
strange
reason
he
believed
he
should
he
stopped
and
rested
many
times
and
he
drank
some
milk
he
had
brought
in
a
canteen
the
higher
he
climbed
the
more
wonderful
everything
was
and
a
strange
feeling
began
to
fill
him
he
said
his
body
stopped
being
tired
and
began
to
feel
very
light
and
his
load
lifted
itself
from
his
heart
as
if
it
were
not
his
load
any
more
but
belonged
to
something
stronger
even
samavia
seemed
to
be
safe
as
he
went
higher
and
higher
and
looked
down
the
abyss
at
the
world
below
it
appeared
as
if
it
were
not
real
but
only
a
dream
he
had
wakened
from
only
a
dream
the
rat
moved
restlessly
perhaps
he
was
with
the
fever
he
suggested
the
fever
had
left
him
and
the
weakness
had
left
him
marco
answered
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
never
really
been
ill
at
all
as
if
no
one
could
be
ill
because
things
like
that
were
only
dreams
just
as
the
world
was
i
wish
i
been
with
him
perhaps
i
could
have
thrown
these
away
down
into
the
abyss
and
the
rat
shook
his
crutches
which
rested
against
the
table
i
feel
as
if
i
was
climbing
too
go
on
marco
had
become
more
absorbed
than
the
rat
he
had
lost
himself
in
the
memory
of
the
story
i
felt
that
was
climbing
when
he
told
me
he
said
i
felt
as
if
i
were
breathing
in
the
hot
and
pushing
aside
the
big
leaves
and
giant
ferns
there
had
been
a
rain
and
they
were
wet
and
shining
with
big
drops
like
jewels
that
showered
over
him
as
he
thrust
his
way
through
and
under
them
and
the
stillness
and
the
height
the
stillness
and
the
height
i
ca
make
it
real
to
you
as
he
made
it
to
me
i
ca
i
was
there
he
took
me
and
it
was
so
high
and
so
still
and
so
beautiful
that
i
could
scarcely
bear
it
but
the
truth
was
that
with
some
vivid
he
had
carried
his
hearer
far
the
rat
was
deadly
quiet
even
his
eyes
had
not
moved
he
spoke
almost
as
if
he
were
in
a
sort
of
trance
it
real
he
said
i
there
now
as
high
as
you
go
on
go
on
i
want
to
climb
higher
and
marco
understanding
went
on
the
day
was
over
and
the
stars
were
out
when
he
reached
the
place
were
the
ledge
was
he
said
he
thought
that
during
the
last
part
of
the
climb
he
never
looked
on
the
earth
at
all
the
stars
were
so
immense
that
he
could
not
look
away
from
them
they
seemed
to
be
drawing
him
up
and
all
overhead
was
like
violet
velvet
and
they
hung
there
like
great
lamps
of
radiance
can
you
see
them
you
must
see
them
my
father
saw
them
all
night
long
they
were
part
of
the
wonder
i
see
them
the
rat
answered
still
in
his
voice
and
without
stirring
and
marco
knew
he
did
and
there
with
the
huge
stars
watching
it
was
the
hut
on
the
ledge
and
there
was
no
one
there
the
door
was
open
and
outside
it
was
a
low
bench
and
table
of
stone
and
on
the
table
was
a
meal
of
dates
and
rice
waiting
not
far
from
the
hut
was
a
deep
spring
which
ran
away
in
a
clear
brook
my
father
drank
and
bathed
his
face
there
then
he
went
out
on
the
ledge
and
sat
down
and
waited
with
his
face
turned
up
to
the
stars
he
did
not
lie
down
and
he
thought
he
saw
the
stars
all
the
time
he
waited
he
was
sure
he
did
not
sleep
he
did
not
know
how
long
he
sat
there
alone
but
at
last
he
drew
his
eyes
from
the
stars
as
if
he
had
been
commanded
to
do
it
and
he
was
not
alone
any
more
a
yard
or
so
away
from
him
sat
the
holy
man
he
knew
it
was
the
hermit
because
his
eyes
were
different
from
any
human
eyes
he
had
ever
beheld
they
were
as
still
as
the
night
was
and
as
deep
as
the
shadows
covering
the
world
thousands
of
feet
below
and
they
had
a
far
far
look
and
a
strange
light
was
in
them
what
did
he
say
asked
the
rat
hoarsely
he
only
said
my
son
i
awaited
thee
go
and
eat
the
food
i
prepared
for
thee
and
then
we
will
speak
together
he
did
move
or
speak
again
until
my
father
had
eaten
the
meal
he
only
sat
on
the
moss
and
let
his
eyes
rest
on
the
shadows
over
the
abyss
when
my
father
went
back
he
made
a
gesture
which
meant
that
he
should
sit
near
him
then
he
sat
still
for
several
minutes
and
let
his
eyes
rest
on
my
father
until
he
felt
as
if
the
light
in
them
were
set
in
the
midst
of
his
own
body
and
his
soul
then
he
said
can
not
tell
thee
all
thou
wouldst
know
that
i
may
not
do
he
had
a
wonderful
gentle
voice
like
a
deep
soft
bell
the
work
will
be
done
thy
life
and
thy
life
will
set
it
on
its
way
they
sat
through
the
whole
night
together
and
the
stars
hung
quite
near
as
if
they
listened
and
there
were
sounds
in
the
bushes
of
stealthy
padding
feet
which
wandered
about
as
if
the
owners
of
them
listened
too
and
the
wonderful
low
peaceful
voice
of
the
holy
man
went
on
and
on
telling
of
wonders
which
seemed
like
miracles
but
which
were
to
him
only
the
of
the
law
what
is
the
law
the
rat
broke
in
there
were
two
my
father
wrote
down
and
i
learned
them
the
first
was
the
law
of
the
one
i
try
to
say
that
and
he
covered
his
eyes
and
waited
through
a
moment
of
silence
it
seemed
to
the
rat
as
if
the
room
held
an
extraordinary
stillness
listen
came
next
this
is
it
are
a
myriad
worlds
there
is
but
one
thought
out
of
which
they
grew
its
law
is
order
which
can
not
swerve
its
creatures
are
free
to
choose
only
they
can
create
disorder
which
in
itself
is
pain
and
woe
and
hate
and
fear
these
they
alone
can
bring
forth
the
great
one
is
a
golden
light
it
is
not
remote
but
near
hold
thyself
within
its
glow
and
thou
wilt
behold
all
things
clearly
first
with
all
thy
breathing
being
know
one
thing
that
thine
own
thought
when
so
thou
standest
is
one
with
that
which
thought
the
worlds
what
gasped
the
rat
thought
the
things
think
your
thoughts
boys
thoughts
anybody
thoughts
you
giving
me
the
he
said
it
answered
marco
and
it
was
then
he
spoke
about
the
broken
link
and
about
the
greatest
books
in
the
world
that
in
all
their
different
ways
they
were
only
saying
over
and
over
again
one
thing
thousands
of
times
just
this
thing
not
fear
not
love
and
he
said
that
was
order
and
when
it
was
disturbed
suffering
came
poverty
and
misery
and
catastrophe
and
wars
wars
the
rat
said
sharply
the
world
could
do
without
war
and
armies
and
defences
what
about
samavia
my
father
asked
him
that
and
this
is
what
he
answered
i
learned
that
too
let
me
think
again
and
he
waited
as
he
had
waited
before
then
he
lifted
his
head
listen
this
is
it
of
the
blackness
of
disorder
and
its
outpouring
of
human
misery
there
will
arise
the
order
which
is
peace
when
man
learns
that
he
is
one
with
the
thought
which
itself
creates
all
beauty
all
power
all
splendor
and
all
repose
he
will
not
fear
that
his
brother
can
rob
him
of
his
heart
desire
he
will
stand
in
the
light
and
draw
to
himself
his
own
draw
to
himself
the
rat
said
draw
what
he
wants
i
do
believe
it
nobody
does
said
marco
we
do
know
he
said
we
stood
in
the
dark
of
the
night
without
stars
and
did
not
know
that
the
broken
chain
swung
just
above
us
i
do
believe
it
said
the
rat
it
too
big
marco
did
not
say
whether
he
believed
it
or
not
he
only
went
on
speaking
my
father
listened
until
he
felt
as
if
he
had
stopped
breathing
just
at
the
stillest
of
the
stillness
the
buddhist
stopped
speaking
and
there
was
a
rustling
of
the
undergrowth
a
few
yards
away
as
if
something
big
was
pushing
its
way
through
and
there
was
the
soft
pad
of
feet
the
buddhist
turned
his
head
and
my
father
heard
him
say
softly
forth
sister
and
a
huge
leopardess
with
two
cubs
walked
out
on
to
the
ledge
and
came
to
him
and
threw
herself
down
with
a
heavy
lunge
near
his
feet
your
father
saw
that
cried
out
the
rat
you
mean
the
old
fellow
knew
something
that
made
wild
beasts
afraid
to
touch
him
or
any
one
near
him
not
afraid
they
knew
he
was
their
brother
and
that
he
was
one
with
the
law
he
had
lived
so
long
with
the
great
thought
that
all
darkness
and
fear
had
left
him
forever
he
had
mended
the
chain
the
rat
had
reached
deep
waters
he
leaned
forward
his
hands
burrowing
in
his
hair
his
face
scowling
and
twisted
his
eyes
boring
into
space
he
had
climbed
to
the
ledge
at
the
he
had
seen
the
luminous
immensity
of
the
stars
and
he
had
looked
down
into
the
shadows
filling
the
world
thousands
of
feet
below
was
there
some
remote
deep
in
him
from
whose
darkness
a
slow
light
was
rising
all
that
loristan
had
said
he
knew
must
be
true
but
the
rest
of
it
marco
got
up
and
came
over
to
him
he
looked
like
his
father
again
if
the
descendant
of
the
lost
prince
is
brought
back
to
rule
samavia
he
will
teach
his
people
the
law
of
the
one
it
was
for
that
the
holy
man
taught
my
father
until
the
dawn
came
who
will
who
will
teach
the
lost
prince
the
new
king
when
he
is
found
the
rat
cried
who
will
teach
him
the
hermit
said
my
father
would
he
said
he
would
also
teach
his
son
and
that
son
would
teach
his
son
and
he
would
teach
his
and
through
such
as
they
were
the
whole
world
would
come
to
know
the
order
and
the
law
never
had
the
rat
looked
so
strange
and
fierce
a
thing
a
whole
world
at
peace
no
tactics
no
battles
no
slaughtered
heroes
no
clash
of
arms
and
fame
it
made
him
feel
sick
and
yet
something
set
his
chest
heaving
and
your
father
would
teach
him
that
when
he
was
found
so
that
he
could
teach
his
sons
your
father
in
it
yes
marco
answered
he
said
nothing
but
yes
the
rat
threw
himself
forward
on
the
table
face
downward
then
he
said
he
must
make
me
believe
it
he
must
teach
me
if
he
can
they
heard
a
clumping
step
upon
the
staircase
and
when
it
reached
the
landing
it
stopped
at
their
door
then
there
was
a
solid
knock
when
marco
opened
the
door
the
young
soldier
who
had
escorted
him
from
the
was
standing
outside
he
looked
as
uninterested
and
stolid
as
before
as
he
handed
in
a
small
flat
package
you
must
have
dropped
it
near
your
seat
at
the
opera
he
said
i
was
to
give
it
into
your
own
hands
it
is
your
purse
after
he
had
clumped
down
the
staircase
again
marco
and
the
rat
drew
a
quick
breath
at
one
and
the
same
time
i
had
no
seat
and
i
had
no
purse
marco
said
let
us
open
it
there
was
a
flat
limp
leather
inside
in
it
was
a
paper
at
the
head
of
which
were
photographs
of
the
lovely
person
and
her
companion
beneath
were
a
few
lines
which
stated
that
they
were
the
well
known
spies
eugenia
karovna
and
paul
varel
and
that
the
bearer
must
be
protected
against
them
it
was
signed
by
the
chief
of
the
police
on
a
separate
sheet
was
written
the
command
carry
this
with
you
as
protection
that
is
help
the
rat
said
it
would
protect
us
even
in
another
country
the
chancellor
sent
it
but
you
made
the
strong
call
and
here
there
was
no
street
lamp
to
shine
into
their
windows
when
they
went
at
last
to
bed
when
the
blind
was
drawn
up
they
were
nearer
the
sky
than
they
had
been
in
the
marylebone
road
the
last
thing
each
of
them
saw
as
he
went
to
sleep
was
the
stars
and
in
their
dreams
they
saw
them
grow
larger
and
larger
and
hang
like
lamps
of
radiance
against
the
sky
above
a
ledge
of
a
himalayan
mountain
where
they
listened
to
the
sound
of
a
low
voice
going
on
and
on
and
on
xxii
the
night
vigil
on
a
hill
in
the
midst
of
a
great
austrian
plain
around
which
high
alps
wait
watching
through
the
ages
stands
a
venerable
fortress
almost
more
beautiful
than
anything
one
has
ever
seen
perhaps
if
it
were
not
for
the
great
plain
flowering
broadly
about
it
with
its
beauties
of
and
wood
and
dim
toned
buildings
gathered
about
farms
and
its
dream
of
a
small
ancient
city
at
its
feet
it
might
though
it
is
to
be
doubted
seem
something
less
a
marvel
of
medieval
picturesqueness
but
out
of
the
plain
rises
the
low
hill
and
surrounding
it
at
a
stately
distance
stands
guard
the
giant
majesty
of
alps
with
shoulders
in
the
clouds
and
heads
above
them
looking
on
always
looking
on
sometimes
themselves
ethereal
clouds
of
some
times
monster
bare
crags
which
pierce
the
blue
and
whose
unchanging
silence
seems
to
know
the
secret
of
the
everlasting
and
on
the
hill
which
this
august
circle
holds
in
its
embrace
as
though
it
enclosed
a
treasure
stands
the
old
old
towered
fortress
built
as
a
citadel
for
the
prince
archbishops
who
were
kings
in
their
domain
in
the
long
past
centuries
when
the
splendor
and
power
of
ecclesiastical
princes
was
among
the
greatest
upon
earth
and
as
you
approach
the
town
and
as
you
leave
it
and
as
you
walk
through
its
streets
the
broad
calm
ones
or
the
narrow
thoroughfares
whose
houses
seem
so
near
to
each
other
whether
you
climb
or
descend
or
cross
bridges
or
gaze
at
churches
or
step
out
on
your
balcony
at
night
to
look
at
the
mountains
and
the
moon
always
it
seems
that
from
some
point
you
can
see
it
gazing
down
at
you
the
citadel
of
it
was
to
salzburg
they
went
next
because
at
salzburg
was
to
be
found
the
man
who
looked
like
a
and
who
worked
in
a
shop
strange
as
it
might
seem
to
him
also
must
be
carried
the
sign
there
may
be
people
who
come
to
him
to
be
shaved
soldiers
or
men
who
know
things
the
rat
worked
it
out
and
he
can
speak
to
them
when
he
is
standing
close
to
them
it
will
be
easy
to
get
near
him
you
can
go
and
have
your
hair
cut
the
journey
from
munich
was
not
a
long
one
and
during
the
latter
part
of
it
they
had
the
carriage
to
themselves
even
the
drowsy
old
peasant
who
nodded
and
slept
in
one
corner
got
out
with
his
bundles
at
last
to
marco
the
mountains
were
wonders
which
could
never
grow
old
they
had
always
and
always
been
so
old
surely
they
had
been
the
first
of
the
world
surely
they
had
been
standing
there
waiting
when
it
was
said
let
there
be
light
the
light
had
known
it
would
find
them
there
they
were
so
silent
and
yet
it
seemed
as
if
they
said
some
amazing
thing
something
which
would
take
your
breath
from
you
if
you
could
hear
it
and
they
never
changed
the
clouds
changed
they
wreathed
them
and
hid
them
and
trailed
down
them
and
poured
out
storm
torrents
on
them
and
thundered
against
them
and
darted
forked
lightnings
round
them
but
the
mountains
stood
there
afterwards
as
if
such
things
had
not
been
and
were
not
in
the
world
winds
roared
and
tore
at
them
centuries
passed
over
them
centuries
of
millions
of
lives
of
changing
of
kingdoms
and
empires
of
battles
and
fame
which
grew
and
died
and
passed
away
and
temples
crumbled
and
kings
tombs
were
forgotten
and
cities
were
buried
and
others
built
over
them
after
hundreds
of
years
and
perhaps
a
few
stones
fell
from
a
mountain
side
or
a
fissure
was
worn
which
the
people
below
could
not
even
see
and
that
was
all
there
they
stood
and
perhaps
their
secret
was
that
they
had
been
there
for
ever
and
ever
that
was
what
the
mountains
said
to
marco
which
was
why
he
did
not
want
to
talk
much
but
sat
and
gazed
out
of
the
carriage
window
the
rat
had
been
very
silent
all
the
morning
he
had
been
silent
when
they
got
up
and
he
had
scarcely
spoken
when
they
made
their
way
to
the
station
at
munich
and
sat
waiting
for
their
train
it
seemed
to
marco
that
he
was
thinking
so
hard
that
he
was
like
a
person
who
was
far
away
from
the
place
he
stood
in
his
brows
were
drawn
together
and
his
eyes
did
not
seem
to
see
the
people
who
passed
by
usually
he
saw
everything
and
made
shrewd
remarks
on
almost
all
he
saw
but
he
was
somehow
otherwise
absorbed
he
sat
in
the
train
with
his
forehead
against
the
window
and
stared
out
he
moved
and
gasped
when
he
found
himself
staring
at
the
alps
but
afterwards
he
was
even
strangely
still
it
was
not
until
after
the
sleepy
old
peasant
had
gathered
his
bundles
and
got
out
at
a
station
that
he
spoke
and
he
did
it
without
turning
his
head
you
only
told
me
one
of
the
two
laws
he
said
what
was
the
other
one
marco
brought
himself
back
from
his
dream
of
reaching
the
highest
and
seeing
clouds
float
beneath
his
feet
in
the
sun
he
had
to
come
back
a
long
way
are
you
thinking
of
that
i
wondered
what
you
had
been
thinking
of
all
the
morning
he
said
i
could
stop
thinking
of
it
what
was
the
second
one
said
the
rat
but
he
did
not
turn
his
head
it
was
called
the
law
of
earthly
living
it
was
for
every
day
said
marco
it
was
for
the
ordering
of
common
things
the
small
things
we
think
do
matter
as
well
as
the
big
ones
i
always
remember
that
one
without
any
trouble
this
was
it
pass
through
thy
mind
my
son
only
the
image
thou
wouldst
desire
to
see
become
a
truth
meditate
only
upon
the
wish
of
thy
heart
seeing
first
that
it
is
such
as
can
wrong
no
man
and
is
not
ignoble
then
will
it
take
earthly
form
and
draw
near
to
is
the
law
of
that
which
creates
then
the
rat
turned
round
he
had
a
shrewdly
reasoning
mind
that
sounds
as
if
you
could
get
anything
you
wanted
if
you
think
about
it
long
enough
and
in
the
right
way
he
said
but
perhaps
it
only
means
that
if
you
do
it
you
be
happy
after
you
dead
my
father
used
to
shout
with
laughing
when
he
was
drunk
and
talked
about
things
like
that
and
looked
at
his
rags
he
hugged
his
knees
for
a
few
minutes
he
was
remembering
the
rags
and
the
room
in
the
slums
and
the
loud
hideous
laughter
what
if
you
want
something
that
will
harm
somebody
else
he
said
next
what
if
you
hate
some
one
and
wish
you
could
kill
him
that
was
one
of
the
questions
my
father
asked
that
night
on
the
ledge
the
holy
man
said
people
always
asked
it
marco
answered
this
was
the
answer
him
who
stretcheth
forth
his
hand
to
draw
the
lightning
to
his
brother
recall
that
through
his
own
soul
and
body
will
pass
the
bolt
wonder
if
there
anything
in
it
the
rat
pondered
it
make
a
chap
careful
if
he
believed
it
revenging
yourself
on
a
man
would
be
like
holding
him
against
a
live
wire
to
kill
him
and
getting
all
the
volts
through
yourself
a
sudden
anxiety
revealed
itself
in
his
face
does
your
father
believe
it
he
asked
does
he
he
knows
it
is
true
marco
said
i
own
up
the
rat
decided
after
further
reflection
i
own
up
i
glad
that
there
is
any
one
left
that
i
a
grudge
against
there
is
any
one
now
then
he
fell
again
into
silence
and
did
not
speak
until
their
journey
was
at
an
end
as
they
arrived
early
in
the
day
they
had
plenty
of
time
to
wander
about
the
marvelous
little
old
city
but
through
the
wide
streets
and
through
the
narrow
ones
under
the
archways
into
the
market
gardens
across
the
bridge
and
into
the
square
where
the
glockenspiel
played
its
old
tinkling
tune
everywhere
the
citadel
looked
down
and
always
the
rat
walked
on
in
his
dream
they
found
the
shop
in
one
of
the
narrow
streets
there
were
no
grand
shops
there
and
this
particular
shop
was
a
modest
one
they
walked
past
it
once
and
then
went
back
it
was
a
shop
so
humble
that
there
was
nothing
remarkable
in
two
common
boys
going
into
it
to
have
their
hair
cut
an
old
man
came
forward
to
receive
them
he
was
evidently
glad
of
their
modest
patronage
he
undertook
to
attend
to
the
rat
himself
but
having
arranged
him
in
a
chair
he
turned
about
and
called
to
some
one
in
the
back
room
heinrich
he
said
in
the
slit
in
marco
sleeve
was
the
sketch
of
the
man
with
smooth
curled
hair
who
looked
like
a
they
had
found
a
corner
in
which
to
take
their
final
look
at
it
before
they
turned
back
to
come
in
heinrich
who
came
forth
from
the
small
back
room
had
smooth
curled
hair
he
looked
extremely
like
a
he
had
features
like
those
in
the
sketch
his
nose
and
mouth
and
chin
and
figure
were
like
what
marco
had
drawn
and
committed
to
memory
but
he
gave
marco
a
chair
and
tied
the
professional
white
covering
around
his
neck
marco
leaned
back
and
closed
his
eyes
a
moment
that
is
the
man
he
was
saying
to
himself
he
is
the
man
how
he
knew
he
was
not
he
could
not
have
explained
but
he
felt
sure
it
was
a
strong
conviction
but
for
the
sudden
feeling
nothing
would
have
been
easier
than
to
give
the
sign
and
if
he
could
not
give
it
now
where
was
the
one
to
whom
it
must
be
spoken
and
what
would
be
the
result
if
that
one
could
not
be
found
and
if
there
were
two
who
were
so
much
alike
how
could
he
be
sure
each
owner
of
each
of
the
pictured
faces
was
a
link
in
a
powerful
secret
chain
and
if
a
link
were
missed
the
chain
would
be
broken
each
time
heinrich
came
within
the
line
of
his
vision
he
recorded
every
feature
afresh
and
compared
it
with
the
remembered
sketch
each
time
the
resemblance
became
more
close
but
each
time
some
persistent
inner
conviction
repeated
no
the
sign
is
not
for
him
it
was
disturbing
also
to
find
that
the
rat
was
all
at
once
as
restless
as
he
had
previously
been
silent
and
preoccupied
he
moved
in
his
chair
to
the
great
discomfort
of
the
old
he
kept
turning
his
head
to
talk
he
asked
marco
to
translate
divers
questions
he
wished
him
to
ask
the
two
men
they
were
questions
about
the
citadel
about
the
monchsberg
the
residenz
the
glockenspiel
the
mountains
he
added
one
query
to
another
and
could
not
sit
still
the
young
gentleman
will
get
an
ear
snipped
said
the
old
man
to
marco
and
it
will
not
be
my
fault
what
shall
i
do
marco
was
thinking
he
is
not
the
man
he
did
not
give
the
sign
he
must
go
away
and
think
it
out
though
where
his
thoughts
would
lead
him
he
did
not
know
this
was
a
more
difficult
problem
than
he
had
ever
dreamed
of
facing
there
was
no
one
to
ask
advice
of
only
himself
and
the
rat
who
was
nervously
wriggling
and
twisting
in
his
chair
you
must
sit
still
he
said
to
him
the
is
afraid
you
will
make
him
cut
you
by
accident
but
i
want
to
know
who
lives
at
the
residenz
said
the
rat
these
men
can
tell
us
things
if
you
ask
them
it
is
done
now
said
the
old
with
a
relieved
air
perhaps
the
cutting
of
his
hair
makes
the
young
gentleman
nervous
it
is
sometimes
so
the
rat
stood
close
to
marco
chair
and
asked
questions
until
heinrich
also
had
done
his
work
marco
could
not
understand
his
change
of
mood
he
realized
that
if
he
had
wished
to
give
the
sign
he
had
been
allowed
no
opportunity
he
could
not
have
given
it
the
restless
questioning
had
so
directed
the
older
man
attention
to
his
son
and
marco
that
nothing
could
have
been
said
to
heinrich
without
his
observing
it
i
could
not
have
spoken
if
he
had
been
the
man
marco
said
to
himself
their
very
exit
from
the
shop
seemed
a
little
hurried
when
they
were
fairly
in
the
street
the
rat
made
a
clutch
at
marco
arm
you
did
give
it
he
whispered
breathlessly
i
kept
talking
and
talking
to
prevent
you
marco
tried
not
to
feel
breathless
and
he
tried
to
speak
in
a
low
and
level
voice
with
no
hint
of
exclamation
in
it
why
did
you
say
that
he
asked
the
rat
drew
closer
to
him
that
was
not
the
man
he
whispered
it
does
matter
how
much
he
looks
like
him
he
is
the
right
one
he
was
pale
and
swinging
along
swiftly
as
if
he
were
in
a
hurry
let
get
into
a
quiet
place
he
said
those
queer
things
you
been
telling
me
have
got
hold
of
me
how
did
i
know
how
could
i
know
unless
it
because
i
been
trying
to
work
that
second
law
i
been
saying
to
myself
that
we
should
be
told
the
right
things
to
do
for
the
game
and
for
your
father
and
so
that
i
could
be
the
right
sort
of
i
been
working
at
it
and
when
he
came
out
i
knew
he
was
not
the
man
in
spite
of
his
looks
and
i
could
be
sure
you
knew
and
i
thought
if
i
kept
on
talking
and
interrupting
you
with
silly
questions
you
could
be
prevented
from
speaking
there
a
place
not
far
away
where
we
can
get
a
look
at
the
mountains
let
go
there
and
sit
down
said
marco
i
knew
it
was
not
the
right
one
too
it
the
help
over
again
yes
it
the
help
it
the
help
it
must
be
muttered
the
rat
walking
fast
and
with
a
pale
set
face
it
could
not
be
anything
else
they
got
away
from
the
streets
and
the
people
and
reached
the
quiet
place
where
they
could
see
the
mountains
there
they
sat
down
by
the
wayside
the
rat
took
off
his
cap
and
wiped
his
forehead
but
it
was
not
only
the
quick
walking
which
had
made
it
damp
the
queerness
of
it
gave
me
a
kind
of
fright
he
said
when
he
came
out
and
he
was
near
enough
for
me
to
see
him
a
sudden
strong
feeling
came
over
me
it
seemed
as
if
i
knew
he
was
the
man
then
i
said
to
myself
he
looks
like
him
and
i
began
to
get
nervous
and
then
i
was
sure
again
and
then
i
wanted
to
try
to
stop
you
from
giving
him
the
sign
and
then
it
all
seemed
foolishness
and
the
next
second
all
the
things
you
had
told
me
rushed
back
to
me
at
once
and
i
remembered
what
i
had
been
thinking
ever
since
and
i
said
it
the
law
beginning
to
work
and
the
palms
of
my
hands
got
moist
marco
was
very
quiet
he
was
looking
at
the
farthest
and
highest
peaks
and
wondering
about
many
things
it
was
the
expression
of
his
face
that
was
different
he
said
and
his
eyes
they
are
rather
smaller
than
the
right
man
are
the
light
in
the
shop
was
poor
and
it
was
not
until
the
last
time
he
bent
over
me
that
i
found
out
what
i
had
not
seen
before
his
eyes
are
gray
the
other
ones
are
brown
did
you
see
that
the
rat
exclaimed
then
we
sure
we
safe
we
not
safe
till
we
found
the
right
man
marco
said
where
is
he
where
is
he
where
is
he
he
said
the
words
dreamily
and
quietly
as
if
he
were
lost
in
thought
but
also
rather
as
if
he
expected
an
answer
and
he
still
looked
at
the
peaks
the
rat
after
watching
him
a
moment
or
so
began
to
look
at
them
also
they
were
like
a
loadstone
to
him
too
there
was
something
stilling
about
them
and
when
your
eyes
had
rested
upon
them
a
few
moments
they
did
not
want
to
move
away
there
must
be
a
ledge
up
there
somewhere
he
said
at
last
let
go
up
and
look
for
it
and
sit
there
and
think
and
think
about
finding
the
right
man
there
seemed
nothing
fantastic
in
this
to
marco
to
go
into
some
quiet
place
and
sit
and
think
about
the
thing
he
wanted
to
remember
or
to
find
out
was
an
old
way
of
his
to
be
quiet
was
always
the
best
thing
his
father
had
taught
him
it
was
like
listening
to
something
which
could
speak
without
words
there
is
a
little
train
which
goes
up
the
gaisberg
he
said
when
you
are
at
the
top
a
world
of
mountains
spreads
around
you
lazarus
went
once
and
told
me
and
we
can
lie
out
on
the
grass
all
night
let
us
go
so
they
went
each
one
thinking
the
same
thought
and
each
holding
its
own
vision
marco
was
the
calmer
of
the
two
because
his
belief
that
there
was
always
help
to
be
found
was
an
accustomed
one
and
had
ceased
to
seem
to
partake
of
the
supernatural
he
believed
quite
simply
that
it
was
the
working
of
a
law
not
the
breaking
of
one
which
gave
answer
and
led
him
in
his
quests
the
rat
who
had
known
nothing
of
laws
other
than
those
administered
by
was
at
once
awed
and
fascinated
by
the
suggestion
of
crossing
some
borderland
of
the
unknown
the
law
of
the
one
had
baffled
and
overthrown
him
with
its
sweeping
away
of
the
enmities
of
passions
which
created
wars
and
called
for
armies
but
the
law
of
earthly
living
seemed
to
offer
practical
benefits
if
you
could
hold
on
to
yourself
enough
to
work
it
you
would
get
everything
for
nothing
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
he
had
said
to
marco
you
have
to
sweep
all
the
rubbish
out
of
your
mind
sweep
it
as
if
you
did
it
with
a
broom
and
then
keep
on
thinking
straight
and
believing
you
were
going
to
get
things
and
working
for
them
and
they
come
then
he
had
laughed
a
short
ugly
laugh
because
he
recalled
something
there
was
something
in
the
bible
that
my
father
used
to
jeer
about
something
about
a
man
getting
what
he
prayed
for
if
he
believed
it
he
said
oh
yes
it
there
said
marco
that
if
a
man
pray
believing
he
shall
receive
what
he
asks
it
shall
be
given
him
all
the
books
say
something
like
it
it
been
said
so
often
it
makes
you
believe
it
he
did
believe
it
and
i
did
said
the
rat
nobody
does
really
answered
marco
as
he
had
done
once
before
because
we
do
know
they
went
up
the
gaisberg
in
the
little
train
which
pushed
and
dragged
and
panted
slowly
upward
with
them
it
took
them
with
it
stubbornly
and
gradually
higher
and
higher
until
it
had
left
salzburg
and
the
citadel
below
and
had
reached
the
world
of
mountains
which
rose
and
spread
and
lifted
great
heads
behind
each
other
and
beside
each
other
and
beyond
each
other
until
there
seemed
no
other
land
on
earth
but
that
on
mountain
sides
and
backs
and
shoulders
and
crowns
and
also
one
felt
the
absurdity
of
living
upon
flat
ground
where
life
must
be
an
insignificant
thing
there
were
only
a
few
in
the
small
carriages
and
they
were
going
to
look
at
the
view
from
the
summit
they
were
not
in
search
of
a
ledge
the
rat
and
marco
were
when
the
little
train
stopped
at
the
top
they
got
out
with
the
rest
they
wandered
about
with
them
over
the
short
grass
on
the
treeless
summit
and
looked
out
from
this
viewpoint
and
the
other
the
rat
grew
more
and
more
silent
and
his
silence
was
not
merely
a
matter
of
speechlessness
but
of
expression
he
silent
and
as
if
he
were
no
longer
aware
of
the
earth
they
left
the
at
last
and
wandered
away
by
themselves
they
found
a
ledge
where
they
could
sit
or
lie
and
where
even
the
world
of
mountains
seemed
below
them
they
had
brought
some
simple
food
with
them
and
they
laid
it
behind
a
jutting
bit
of
rock
when
the
boarded
the
laboring
little
train
again
and
were
dragged
back
down
the
mountain
their
night
of
vigil
would
begin
that
was
what
it
was
to
be
a
night
of
stillness
on
the
heights
where
they
could
wait
and
watch
and
hold
themselves
ready
to
hear
any
thought
which
spoke
to
them
the
rat
was
so
thrilled
that
he
would
not
have
been
surprised
if
he
had
heard
a
voice
from
the
place
of
the
stars
but
marco
only
believed
that
in
this
great
stillness
and
beauty
if
he
held
his
quiet
enough
he
should
find
himself
at
last
thinking
of
something
that
would
lead
him
to
the
place
which
held
what
it
was
best
that
he
should
find
the
people
returned
to
the
train
and
it
set
out
upon
its
way
down
the
steepness
they
heard
it
laboring
on
its
way
as
though
it
was
forced
to
make
as
much
effort
to
hold
itself
back
as
it
had
made
to
drag
itself
upward
then
they
were
alone
and
it
was
a
loneness
such
as
an
eagle
might
feel
when
it
held
itself
poised
high
in
the
curve
of
blue
and
they
sat
and
watched
they
saw
the
sun
go
down
and
shade
by
shade
deepen
and
make
radiant
and
then
draw
away
with
it
the
last
touches
of
color
and
one
after
another
held
its
blush
a
few
moments
and
lost
it
it
took
long
to
gather
them
all
but
at
length
they
were
gone
and
the
marvel
of
night
fell
the
breath
of
the
forests
below
was
sweet
about
them
and
soundlessness
enclosed
them
which
was
of
unearthly
peace
the
stars
began
to
show
themselves
and
presently
the
two
who
waited
found
their
faces
turned
upward
to
the
sky
and
they
both
were
speaking
in
whispers
the
stars
look
large
here
the
rat
said
yes
answered
marco
we
are
not
as
high
as
the
buddhist
was
but
it
seems
like
the
top
of
the
world
there
is
a
light
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
yonder
which
is
not
a
star
the
rat
whispered
it
is
a
light
in
a
hut
where
the
guides
take
the
climbers
to
rest
and
to
spend
the
night
answered
marco
it
is
so
still
the
rat
whispered
again
after
a
silence
and
marco
whispered
back
it
is
so
still
they
had
eaten
their
meal
of
black
bread
and
cheese
after
the
setting
of
the
sun
and
now
they
lay
down
on
their
backs
and
looked
up
until
the
first
few
stars
had
multiplied
themselves
into
myriads
they
began
a
little
low
talk
but
the
soundlessness
was
stronger
than
themselves
how
am
i
going
to
hold
on
to
that
second
law
the
rat
said
restlessly
pass
through
thy
mind
only
the
image
thou
wouldst
see
become
a
truth
the
things
that
are
passing
through
my
mind
are
not
the
things
i
want
to
come
true
what
if
we
do
find
him
do
find
the
right
one
i
mean
lie
still
still
and
look
up
at
the
stars
whispered
marco
they
give
you
a
feeling
there
was
something
in
the
curious
serenity
of
him
which
calmed
even
his
the
rat
lay
still
and
looked
and
looked
and
thought
and
what
he
thought
of
was
the
desire
of
his
heart
the
soundlessness
enwrapped
him
and
there
was
no
world
left
that
there
was
a
spark
of
light
in
the
was
a
thing
forgotten
they
were
only
two
boys
and
they
had
begun
their
journey
on
the
earliest
train
and
had
been
walking
about
all
day
and
thinking
of
great
and
anxious
things
it
is
so
still
the
rat
whispered
again
at
last
it
is
so
still
whispered
marco
and
the
mountains
rising
behind
each
other
and
beside
each
other
and
beyond
each
other
in
the
night
and
also
the
myriads
of
stars
which
had
so
multiplied
themselves
looking
down
knew
that
they
were
asleep
as
sleep
the
human
things
which
do
not
watch
forever
some
one
is
smoking
marco
found
himself
saying
in
a
dream
after
which
he
awakened
and
found
that
the
smoke
was
not
part
of
a
dream
at
all
it
came
from
the
pipe
of
a
young
man
who
had
an
alpenstock
and
who
looked
as
if
he
had
climbed
to
see
the
sun
rise
he
wore
the
clothes
of
a
climber
and
a
green
hat
with
a
tuft
at
the
back
he
looked
down
at
the
two
boys
surprised
good
day
he
said
did
you
sleep
here
so
that
you
could
see
the
sun
get
up
yes
answered
marco
were
you
cold
we
slept
too
soundly
to
know
and
we
brought
our
thick
coats
i
slept
down
the
mountains
said
the
smoker
i
am
a
guide
in
these
days
but
i
have
not
been
one
long
enough
to
miss
a
sunrise
it
is
no
work
to
reach
my
father
and
brother
think
i
am
mad
about
such
things
they
would
rather
stay
in
their
beds
oh
he
is
awake
is
he
turning
toward
the
rat
who
had
risen
on
one
elbow
and
was
staring
at
him
what
is
the
matter
you
look
as
if
you
were
afraid
of
me
marco
did
not
wait
for
the
rat
to
recover
his
breath
and
speak
i
know
why
he
looks
at
you
so
he
answered
for
him
he
is
startled
yesterday
we
went
to
a
shop
down
below
there
and
we
saw
a
man
who
was
almost
exactly
like
you
only
he
added
looking
up
his
eyes
were
gray
and
yours
are
brown
he
was
my
twin
brother
said
the
guide
puffing
at
his
pipe
cheerfully
my
father
thought
he
could
make
of
us
both
and
i
tried
it
for
four
years
but
i
always
wanted
to
be
climbing
the
mountains
and
there
were
not
holidays
enough
so
i
cut
my
hair
and
washed
the
pomade
out
of
it
and
broke
away
i
do
look
like
a
now
do
i
he
did
not
not
at
all
but
marco
knew
him
he
was
the
man
there
was
no
one
on
the
but
themselves
and
the
sun
was
just
showing
a
rim
of
gold
above
the
farthest
and
highest
giant
shoulders
one
need
not
be
afraid
to
do
anything
since
there
was
no
one
to
see
or
hear
marco
slipped
the
sketch
out
of
the
slit
in
his
sleeve
he
looked
at
it
and
he
looked
at
the
guide
and
then
he
showed
it
to
him
that
is
not
your
brother
it
is
you
he
said
the
man
face
changed
a
little
more
than
any
other
face
had
changed
when
its
owner
had
been
spoken
to
on
a
as
the
sun
rises
one
is
not
afraid
the
lamp
is
lighted
said
marco
the
lamp
is
lighted
god
be
thanked
burst
forth
the
man
and
he
took
off
his
hat
and
bared
his
head
then
the
rim
behind
the
mountain
shoulder
leaped
forth
into
a
golden
torrent
of
splendor
and
the
rat
stood
up
resting
his
weight
on
his
crutches
in
utter
silence
and
stared
and
stared
that
is
three
said
marco
xxiii
the
silver
horn
during
the
next
week
which
they
spent
in
journeying
towards
vienna
they
gave
the
sign
to
three
different
persons
at
places
which
were
on
the
way
in
a
village
across
the
frontier
in
bavaria
they
found
a
giant
of
an
old
man
sitting
on
a
bench
under
a
tree
before
his
mountain
gasthaus
or
inn
and
when
the
four
words
were
uttered
he
stood
up
and
bared
his
head
as
the
guide
had
done
when
marco
gave
the
sign
in
some
quiet
place
to
a
man
who
was
alone
he
noticed
that
they
all
did
this
and
said
their
god
be
thanked
devoutly
as
if
it
were
part
of
some
religious
ceremony
in
a
small
town
a
few
miles
away
he
had
to
search
some
hours
before
he
found
a
stalwart
young
shoemaker
with
bright
red
hair
and
a
scar
on
his
forehead
he
was
not
in
his
workshop
when
the
boys
first
passed
it
because
as
they
found
out
later
he
had
been
climbing
a
mountain
the
day
before
and
had
been
detained
in
the
descent
because
his
companion
had
hurt
himself
when
marco
went
in
and
asked
him
to
measure
him
for
a
pair
of
shoes
he
was
quite
friendly
and
told
them
all
about
it
there
are
some
good
fellows
who
should
not
climb
he
said
when
they
find
themselves
standing
on
a
bit
of
rock
jutting
out
over
emptiness
their
heads
begin
to
whirl
round
and
then
if
they
do
turn
head
over
heels
a
few
thousand
feet
it
is
because
some
comrade
is
near
enough
to
drag
them
back
there
can
be
no
ceremony
then
and
they
sometimes
get
hurt
as
my
friend
did
yesterday
did
you
never
get
hurt
yourself
the
rat
asked
when
i
was
eight
years
old
i
did
that
said
the
young
shoemaker
touching
the
scar
on
his
forehead
but
it
was
not
much
my
father
was
a
guide
and
took
me
with
him
he
wanted
me
to
begin
early
there
is
nothing
like
it
climbing
i
shall
be
at
it
again
this
wo
do
for
me
i
tried
shoemaking
because
i
was
in
love
with
a
girl
who
wanted
me
to
stay
at
home
she
married
another
man
i
am
glad
of
it
once
a
guide
always
a
guide
he
knelt
down
to
measure
marco
foot
and
marco
bent
a
little
forward
the
lamp
is
lighted
he
said
there
was
no
one
in
the
shop
but
the
door
was
open
and
people
were
passing
in
the
narrow
street
so
the
shoemaker
did
not
lift
his
red
head
he
went
on
measuring
god
be
thanked
he
said
in
a
low
voice
do
you
want
these
shoes
really
or
did
you
only
want
me
to
take
your
measure
i
can
not
wait
until
they
are
made
marco
answered
i
must
go
on
yes
you
must
go
on
answered
the
shoemaker
but
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
make
them
and
keep
them
some
great
day
might
come
when
i
shall
show
them
to
people
and
swagger
about
them
he
glanced
round
cautiously
and
then
ended
still
bending
over
his
measuring
they
will
be
called
the
shoes
of
the
bearer
of
the
sign
and
i
shall
say
was
only
a
lad
this
was
the
size
of
his
foot
then
he
stood
up
with
a
great
smile
there
be
climbing
enough
to
be
done
now
he
said
and
i
look
to
see
you
again
somewhere
when
the
boys
went
away
they
talked
it
over
the
did
want
to
be
a
and
the
shoemaker
did
want
to
make
shoes
said
the
rat
they
both
wanted
to
be
there
are
mountains
in
samavia
and
mountains
on
the
way
to
it
you
showed
them
to
me
on
the
map
yes
and
secret
messengers
who
can
climb
anywhere
and
cross
dangerous
places
and
reconnoiter
from
points
no
one
else
can
reach
can
find
out
things
and
give
signals
other
men
can
not
said
marco
that
what
i
thought
out
the
rat
answered
that
was
what
he
meant
when
he
said
will
be
climbing
enough
to
be
done
now
strange
were
the
places
they
went
to
and
curiously
unlike
each
other
were
the
people
to
whom
they
carried
their
message
the
most
singular
of
all
was
an
old
woman
who
lived
in
so
remote
a
place
that
the
road
which
wound
round
and
round
the
mountain
wound
round
it
for
miles
and
miles
it
was
not
a
bad
road
and
it
was
an
amazing
one
to
travel
dragged
in
a
small
cart
by
a
mule
when
one
could
be
dragged
and
clambering
slowly
with
rests
between
when
one
could
not
the
precipices
one
looked
down
the
tossing
whiteness
of
waterfalls
or
the
green
foaming
of
rushing
streams
and
the
immensity
of
and
plains
spreading
themselves
to
the
feet
of
other
mountains
shutting
them
in
were
beauties
to
look
down
on
as
the
road
mounted
and
wound
round
and
round
and
higher
and
higher
how
can
any
one
live
higher
than
this
said
the
rat
as
they
sat
on
the
thick
moss
by
the
wayside
after
the
mule
and
cart
had
left
them
look
at
the
bare
crags
looming
up
above
there
let
us
look
at
her
again
her
picture
looked
as
if
she
were
a
hundred
years
old
marco
took
out
his
hidden
sketch
it
seemed
surely
one
of
the
strangest
things
in
the
world
that
a
creature
as
old
as
this
one
seemed
could
reach
such
a
place
or
having
reached
it
could
ever
descend
to
the
world
again
to
give
aid
to
any
person
or
thing
her
old
face
was
crossed
and
recrossed
with
a
thousand
wrinkles
her
profile
was
splendid
yet
and
she
had
been
a
beauty
in
her
day
her
eyes
were
like
an
eagle
and
not
an
old
eagle
and
she
had
a
long
neck
which
held
her
old
head
high
how
could
she
get
here
exclaimed
the
rat
those
who
sent
us
know
though
we
do
said
marco
will
you
sit
here
and
rest
while
i
go
on
further
no
the
rat
answered
stubbornly
i
did
train
myself
to
stay
behind
but
we
shall
come
to
climbing
soon
and
then
i
shall
be
obliged
to
stop
and
he
said
the
last
bitterly
he
knew
that
if
marco
had
come
alone
he
would
have
ridden
in
no
cart
but
would
have
trudged
upward
and
onward
sturdily
to
the
end
of
his
journey
but
they
did
not
reach
the
crags
as
they
had
thought
must
be
inevitable
suddenly
to
the
sky
as
it
seemed
they
came
to
a
bend
in
the
road
and
found
themselves
mounting
into
a
new
green
world
an
astonishing
marvel
of
a
world
with
green
velvet
slopes
and
soft
meadows
and
thick
woodland
and
cows
feeding
in
velvet
pastures
and
as
if
it
had
been
snowed
down
from
the
huge
bare
mountain
crags
which
still
soared
above
into
heaven
a
mysterious
ancient
huddled
village
which
being
thus
snowed
down
might
have
caught
among
the
rocks
and
rested
there
through
all
time
there
it
stood
there
it
huddled
itself
and
the
monsters
in
the
blue
above
it
themselves
looked
down
upon
it
as
if
it
were
an
incredible
thing
this
ancient
crumbling
cluster
of
human
nests
which
seemed
a
thousand
miles
from
the
world
marco
and
the
rat
stood
and
stared
at
it
then
they
sat
down
and
stared
at
it
how
did
it
get
here
the
rat
cried
marco
shook
his
head
he
certainly
could
see
no
explanation
of
its
being
there
perhaps
some
of
the
oldest
villagers
could
tell
stories
of
how
its
first
chalets
had
gathered
themselves
together
an
old
peasant
driving
a
cow
came
down
a
steep
path
he
looked
with
a
dull
curiosity
at
the
rat
and
his
crutches
but
when
marco
advanced
and
spoke
to
him
in
german
he
did
not
seem
to
understand
but
shook
his
head
saying
something
in
a
sort
of
dialect
marco
did
not
know
if
they
all
speak
like
that
we
shall
have
to
make
signs
when
we
want
to
ask
anything
the
rat
said
what
will
she
speak
she
will
know
the
german
for
the
sign
or
we
should
not
have
been
sent
here
answered
marco
come
on
they
made
their
way
to
the
village
which
huddled
itself
together
evidently
with
the
object
of
keeping
itself
warm
when
through
the
winter
months
the
snows
strove
to
bury
it
and
the
winds
roared
down
from
the
huge
mountain
crags
and
tried
to
tear
it
from
among
its
rocks
the
doors
and
windows
were
few
and
small
and
glimpses
of
the
inside
of
the
houses
showed
earthen
floors
and
dark
rooms
it
was
plain
that
it
was
counted
a
more
comfortable
thing
to
live
without
light
than
to
let
in
the
cold
it
was
easy
enough
to
reconnoiter
the
few
people
they
saw
were
evidently
not
surprised
that
strangers
who
discovered
their
unexpected
existence
should
be
curious
and
want
to
look
at
them
and
their
houses
the
boys
wandered
about
as
if
they
were
casual
explorers
who
having
reached
the
place
by
chance
were
interested
in
all
they
saw
they
went
into
the
little
gasthaus
and
got
some
black
bread
and
sausage
and
some
milk
the
mountaineer
owner
was
a
brawny
fellow
who
understood
some
german
he
told
them
that
few
strangers
knew
of
the
village
but
that
bold
hunters
and
climbers
came
for
sport
in
the
forests
on
the
mountain
sides
were
bears
and
in
the
high
places
chamois
now
and
again
some
great
gentlemen
came
with
parties
of
the
daring
kind
very
great
gentlemen
indeed
he
said
shaking
his
head
with
pride
there
was
one
who
had
castles
in
other
mountains
but
he
liked
best
to
come
here
marco
began
to
wonder
if
several
strange
things
might
not
be
true
if
great
gentlemen
sometimes
climbed
to
the
mysterious
place
but
he
had
not
been
sent
to
give
the
sign
to
a
great
gentleman
he
had
been
sent
to
give
it
to
an
old
woman
with
eyes
like
an
eagle
which
was
young
he
had
a
sketch
in
his
sleeve
with
that
of
her
face
of
her
balconied
house
if
they
walked
about
a
little
they
would
be
sure
to
come
upon
it
in
this
tiny
place
then
he
could
go
in
and
ask
her
for
a
drink
of
water
they
roamed
about
for
an
hour
after
they
left
the
gasthaus
they
went
into
the
little
church
and
looked
at
the
graveyard
and
wondered
if
it
was
not
buried
out
of
all
sight
in
the
winter
after
they
had
done
this
they
sauntered
out
and
walked
through
the
huddled
clusters
of
houses
examining
each
one
as
they
drew
near
it
and
passed
i
see
it
the
rat
exclaimed
at
last
it
is
that
very
one
standing
a
little
way
from
the
rest
it
is
not
as
tumbled
down
as
most
of
them
and
there
are
some
red
flowers
on
the
balcony
yes
that
it
said
marco
they
walked
up
to
the
low
black
door
and
as
he
stopped
on
the
threshold
marco
took
off
his
cap
he
did
this
because
sitting
in
the
doorway
on
a
low
wooden
chair
the
old
old
woman
with
the
eagle
eyes
was
sitting
knitting
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
and
no
one
anywhere
within
sight
when
the
old
old
woman
looked
up
at
him
with
her
young
eagle
eyes
holding
her
head
high
on
her
long
neck
marco
knew
he
need
not
ask
for
water
or
for
anything
else
the
lamp
is
lighted
he
said
in
his
low
but
strong
and
clear
young
voice
she
dropped
her
knitting
upon
her
knees
and
gazed
at
him
a
moment
in
silence
she
knew
german
it
was
clear
for
it
was
in
german
she
answered
him
god
be
thanked
she
said
come
in
young
bearer
of
the
sign
and
bring
your
friend
in
with
you
i
live
alone
and
not
a
soul
is
within
hearing
she
was
a
wonderful
old
woman
neither
marco
nor
the
rat
would
live
long
enough
to
forget
the
hours
they
spent
in
her
strange
dark
house
she
kept
them
and
made
them
spend
the
night
with
her
it
is
quite
safe
she
said
i
live
alone
since
my
man
fell
into
the
crevasse
and
was
killed
because
his
rope
broke
when
he
was
trying
to
save
his
comrade
so
i
have
two
rooms
to
spare
and
sometimes
climbers
are
glad
to
sleep
in
them
mine
is
a
good
warm
house
and
i
am
well
known
in
the
village
you
are
very
young
she
added
shaking
her
head
you
are
very
young
you
must
have
good
blood
in
your
veins
to
be
trusted
with
this
i
have
my
father
blood
answered
marco
you
are
like
some
one
i
once
saw
the
old
woman
said
and
her
eagle
eyes
set
themselves
hard
upon
him
tell
me
your
name
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
tell
it
to
her
it
is
marco
loristan
he
said
what
it
is
that
she
cried
out
not
loud
but
low
to
marco
amazement
she
got
up
from
her
chair
and
stood
before
him
showing
what
a
tall
old
woman
she
really
was
there
was
a
startled
even
an
agitated
look
in
her
face
and
suddenly
she
actually
made
a
sort
of
curtsey
to
him
bending
her
knee
as
peasants
do
when
they
pass
a
shrine
it
is
that
she
said
again
and
yet
they
dare
let
you
go
on
a
journey
like
this
that
speaks
for
your
courage
and
for
theirs
but
marco
did
not
know
what
she
meant
her
strange
obeisance
made
him
feel
awkward
he
stood
up
because
his
training
had
told
him
that
when
a
woman
stands
a
man
also
rises
the
name
speaks
for
the
courage
he
said
because
it
is
my
father
she
watched
him
almost
anxiously
you
do
not
even
know
she
breathed
and
it
was
an
exclamation
and
not
a
question
i
know
what
i
have
been
told
to
do
he
answered
i
do
not
ask
anything
else
who
is
that
she
asked
pointing
to
the
rat
he
is
the
friend
my
father
sent
with
me
said
marco
smiling
he
called
him
my
it
was
a
sort
of
joke
because
we
had
played
soldiers
together
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
obliged
to
collect
her
thoughts
she
stood
with
her
hand
at
her
mouth
looking
down
at
the
earth
floor
god
guard
you
she
said
at
last
you
are
very
very
young
but
all
his
years
the
rat
broke
in
he
has
been
in
training
for
just
this
thing
he
did
not
know
it
was
training
but
it
was
a
soldier
who
had
been
trained
for
thirteen
years
would
know
his
work
he
was
so
eager
that
he
forgot
she
could
not
understand
english
marco
translated
what
he
said
into
german
and
added
what
he
says
is
true
she
nodded
her
head
still
with
questioning
and
anxious
eyes
yes
yes
she
muttered
but
you
are
very
young
then
she
asked
in
a
hesitating
way
will
you
not
sit
down
until
i
do
no
answered
marco
i
would
not
sit
while
my
mother
or
grandmother
stood
then
i
must
sit
and
forget
she
said
she
passed
her
hand
over
her
face
as
though
she
were
sweeping
away
the
sudden
puzzled
trouble
in
her
expression
then
she
sat
down
as
if
she
had
obliged
herself
to
become
again
the
old
peasant
she
had
been
when
they
entered
all
the
way
up
the
mountain
you
wondered
why
an
old
woman
should
be
given
the
sign
she
said
you
asked
each
other
how
she
could
be
of
use
neither
marco
nor
the
rat
said
anything
when
i
was
young
and
fresh
she
went
on
i
went
to
a
castle
over
the
frontier
to
be
to
a
child
who
was
born
a
great
noble
one
who
was
near
the
throne
he
loved
me
and
i
loved
him
he
was
a
strong
child
and
he
grew
up
a
great
hunter
and
climber
when
he
was
not
ten
years
old
my
man
taught
him
to
climb
he
always
loved
these
mountains
better
than
his
own
he
comes
to
see
me
as
if
he
were
only
a
young
mountaineer
he
sleeps
in
the
room
there
with
a
gesture
over
her
shoulder
into
the
darkness
he
has
great
power
and
if
he
chooses
to
do
a
thing
he
will
do
it
just
as
he
will
attack
the
biggest
bear
or
climb
the
most
dangerous
peak
he
is
one
who
can
bring
things
about
it
is
very
safe
to
talk
in
this
room
then
all
was
quite
clear
marco
and
the
rat
understood
no
more
was
said
about
the
sign
it
had
been
given
and
that
was
enough
the
old
woman
told
them
that
they
must
sleep
in
one
of
her
bedrooms
the
next
morning
one
of
her
neighbors
was
going
down
to
the
valley
with
a
cart
and
he
would
help
them
on
their
way
the
rat
knew
that
she
was
thinking
of
his
crutches
and
he
became
restless
tell
her
he
said
to
marco
how
i
have
trained
myself
until
i
can
do
what
any
one
else
can
and
tell
her
i
am
growing
stronger
every
day
tell
her
i
show
her
what
i
can
do
your
father
would
have
let
me
come
as
your
aide
if
i
had
proved
to
him
that
i
was
a
cripple
tell
her
she
thinks
i
no
use
marco
explained
and
the
old
woman
listened
attentively
when
the
rat
got
up
and
swung
himself
about
up
and
down
the
steep
path
near
her
house
she
seemed
relieved
his
extraordinary
dexterity
and
firm
swiftness
evidently
amazed
her
and
gave
her
a
confidence
she
had
not
felt
at
first
if
he
has
taught
himself
to
be
like
that
just
for
love
of
your
father
he
will
go
to
the
end
she
said
it
is
more
than
one
could
believe
that
a
pair
of
crutches
could
do
such
things
the
rat
was
pacified
and
could
afterwards
give
himself
up
to
watching
her
as
closely
as
he
wished
to
he
was
soon
working
out
certain
things
in
his
mind
what
he
watched
was
her
way
of
watching
marco
it
was
as
if
she
were
fascinated
and
could
not
keep
her
eyes
from
him
she
told
them
stories
about
the
mountains
and
the
strangers
who
came
to
climb
with
guides
or
to
hunt
she
told
them
about
the
storms
which
sometimes
seemed
about
to
put
an
end
to
the
little
world
among
the
crags
she
described
the
winter
when
the
snow
buried
them
and
the
strong
ones
were
forced
to
dig
out
the
weak
and
some
lived
for
days
under
the
masses
of
soft
whiteness
glad
to
keep
their
cows
or
goats
in
their
rooms
that
they
might
share
the
warmth
of
their
bodies
the
villages
were
forced
to
be
good
neighbors
to
each
other
for
the
man
who
was
not
ready
to
dig
out
a
hidden
chimney
or
buried
door
might
be
left
to
freeze
and
starve
in
his
snow
tomb
next
week
through
the
worst
part
of
the
winter
no
creature
from
the
world
below
could
make
way
to
them
to
find
out
whether
they
were
all
dead
or
alive
while
she
talked
she
watched
marco
as
if
she
were
always
asking
herself
some
question
about
him
the
rat
was
sure
that
she
liked
him
and
greatly
admired
his
strong
body
and
good
looks
it
was
not
necessary
for
him
to
carry
himself
slouchingly
in
her
presence
and
he
looked
glowing
and
noble
there
was
a
sort
of
reverence
in
her
manner
when
she
spoke
to
him
she
reminded
him
of
lazarus
more
than
once
when
she
gave
them
their
evening
meal
she
insisted
on
waiting
on
him
with
a
certain
respectful
ceremony
she
would
not
sit
at
table
with
him
and
the
rat
began
to
realize
that
she
felt
that
he
himself
should
be
standing
to
serve
him
she
thinks
i
ought
to
stand
behind
your
chair
as
lazarus
stands
behind
your
father
he
said
to
marco
perhaps
an
aide
ought
to
do
it
shall
i
i
believe
it
would
please
her
a
bearer
of
the
sign
is
not
a
royal
person
answered
marco
my
father
would
not
like
it
and
i
should
not
we
are
only
two
boys
it
was
very
wonderful
when
after
their
supper
was
over
they
all
three
sat
together
before
the
fire
the
red
glow
of
the
bed
of
and
the
orange
yellow
of
the
flame
from
the
big
logs
filled
the
room
with
warm
light
which
made
a
mellow
background
for
the
figure
of
the
old
woman
as
she
sat
in
her
low
chair
and
told
them
more
and
more
enthralling
stories
her
eagle
eyes
glowed
and
her
long
neck
held
her
head
splendidly
high
as
she
described
great
feats
of
courage
and
endurance
or
almost
superhuman
daring
in
aiding
those
in
awesome
peril
and
when
she
glowed
most
in
the
telling
they
always
knew
that
the
hero
of
the
adventure
had
been
her
who
was
the
baby
born
a
great
noble
and
near
the
throne
to
her
he
was
the
most
splendid
and
adorable
of
human
beings
almost
an
emperor
but
so
warm
and
tender
of
heart
that
he
never
forgot
the
days
when
she
had
held
him
on
her
knee
and
told
him
tales
of
and
and
of
the
in
midwinter
he
was
her
yes
yes
she
said
mother
he
calls
me
and
i
bake
him
a
cake
on
the
hearth
as
i
did
when
he
was
ten
years
old
and
my
man
was
teaching
him
to
climb
and
when
he
chooses
that
a
thing
shall
be
done
done
it
is
he
is
a
great
lord
the
flames
had
died
down
and
only
the
big
bed
of
red
coal
made
the
room
glow
and
they
were
thinking
of
going
to
bed
when
the
old
woman
started
very
suddenly
turning
her
head
as
if
to
listen
marco
and
the
rat
heard
nothing
but
they
saw
that
she
did
and
they
sat
so
still
that
each
held
his
breath
so
there
was
utter
stillness
for
a
few
moments
utter
stillness
then
they
did
hear
something
a
clear
silver
sound
piercing
the
pure
mountain
air
the
old
woman
sprang
upright
with
the
fire
of
delight
in
her
eyes
it
is
his
silver
horn
she
cried
out
striking
her
hands
together
it
is
his
own
call
to
me
when
he
is
coming
he
has
been
hunting
somewhere
and
wants
to
sleep
in
his
good
bed
here
help
me
to
put
on
more
faggots
to
the
rat
so
that
he
will
see
the
flame
of
them
through
the
open
door
as
he
comes
shall
we
be
in
the
way
said
marco
we
can
go
at
once
she
was
going
towards
the
door
to
open
it
and
she
stopped
a
moment
and
turned
no
no
she
said
he
must
see
your
face
he
will
want
to
see
it
i
want
him
to
see
how
young
you
are
she
threw
the
door
wide
open
and
they
heard
the
silver
horn
send
out
its
gay
call
again
the
brushwood
and
faggots
the
rat
had
thrown
on
the
coals
crackled
and
sparkled
and
roared
into
fine
flames
which
cast
their
light
into
the
road
and
threw
out
in
fine
relief
the
old
figure
which
stood
on
the
threshold
and
looked
so
tall
and
in
but
a
few
minutes
her
great
lord
came
to
her
and
in
his
green
with
its
green
hat
and
eagle
feather
he
was
as
splendid
as
she
had
said
he
was
he
was
big
and
and
laughing
and
he
bent
and
kissed
her
as
if
he
had
been
her
own
son
yes
good
mother
they
heard
him
say
i
want
my
warm
bed
and
one
of
your
good
suppers
i
sent
the
others
to
the
gasthaus
he
came
into
the
redly
glowing
room
and
his
head
almost
touched
the
blackened
rafters
then
he
saw
the
two
boys
who
are
these
good
mother
he
asked
she
lifted
his
hand
and
kissed
it
they
are
the
bearers
of
the
sign
she
said
rather
softly
lamp
is
lighted
then
his
whole
look
changed
his
laughing
face
became
quite
grave
and
for
a
moment
looked
even
anxious
marco
knew
it
was
because
he
was
startled
to
find
them
only
boys
he
made
a
step
forward
to
look
at
them
more
closely
the
lamp
is
lighted
and
you
two
bear
the
sign
he
exclaimed
marco
stood
out
in
the
fire
glow
that
he
might
see
him
well
he
saluted
with
respect
my
name
is
marco
loristan
highness
he
said
and
my
father
sent
me
the
change
which
came
upon
his
face
then
was
even
greater
than
at
first
for
a
second
marco
even
felt
that
there
was
a
flash
of
alarm
in
it
but
almost
at
once
that
passed
loristan
is
a
great
man
and
a
great
patriot
he
said
if
he
sent
you
it
is
because
he
knows
you
are
the
one
safe
messenger
he
has
worked
too
long
for
samavia
not
to
know
what
he
does
marco
saluted
again
he
knew
what
it
was
right
to
say
next
if
we
have
your
highness
permission
to
retire
he
said
we
will
leave
you
and
go
to
bed
we
go
down
the
mountain
at
sunrise
where
next
asked
the
hunter
looking
at
him
with
curious
intentness
to
vienna
highness
marco
answered
his
questioner
held
out
his
hand
still
with
the
intent
interest
in
his
eyes
good
night
fine
lad
he
said
samavia
has
need
to
vaunt
itself
on
its
god
go
with
you
he
stood
and
watched
him
as
he
went
toward
the
room
in
which
he
and
his
were
to
sleep
the
rat
followed
him
closely
at
the
little
back
door
the
old
old
woman
stood
having
opened
it
for
them
as
marco
passed
and
bade
her
good
night
he
saw
that
she
again
made
the
strange
obeisance
bending
the
knee
as
he
went
by
xxiv
how
shall
we
find
him
in
vienna
they
came
upon
a
pageant
in
celebration
of
a
victory
the
emperor
drove
in
state
and
ceremony
to
attend
at
the
great
cathedral
and
to
do
honor
to
the
ancient
banners
and
statue
of
a
the
broad
pavements
of
the
huge
chief
thoroughfare
were
crowded
with
a
cheering
populace
watching
the
martial
pomp
and
splendor
as
it
passed
by
with
marching
feet
prancing
horses
and
glitter
of
scabbard
and
chain
which
all
seemed
somehow
part
of
music
in
triumphant
bursts
the
rat
was
enormously
thrilled
by
the
magnificence
of
the
imperial
place
its
immense
spaces
the
squares
and
gardens
reigned
over
by
statues
of
emperors
and
warriors
and
queens
made
him
feel
that
all
things
on
earth
were
possible
the
palaces
and
stately
piles
of
architecture
whose
surmounting
equestrian
bronzes
ramped
high
in
the
air
clear
cut
and
beautiful
against
the
sky
seemed
to
sweep
out
of
his
world
all
atmosphere
but
that
of
splendid
cities
down
whose
broad
avenues
emperors
rode
with
waving
banners
tramping
jangling
soldiery
before
and
behind
and
golden
trumpets
blaring
forth
it
seemed
as
if
it
must
always
be
like
this
that
lances
and
cavalry
and
emperors
would
never
cease
to
ride
by
i
should
like
to
stay
here
a
long
time
he
said
almost
as
if
he
were
in
a
dream
i
should
like
to
see
it
all
he
leaned
on
his
crutches
in
the
crowd
and
watched
the
glitter
of
the
passing
pageant
now
and
then
he
glanced
at
marco
who
watched
also
with
a
steady
eye
which
the
rat
saw
nothing
would
escape
how
absorbed
he
always
was
in
the
game
how
impossible
it
was
for
him
to
forget
it
or
to
remember
it
only
as
a
boy
would
often
it
seemed
that
he
was
not
a
boy
at
all
and
the
game
the
rat
knew
in
these
days
was
a
game
no
more
but
a
thing
of
deep
and
deadly
earnest
a
thing
which
touched
kings
and
thrones
and
concerned
the
ruling
and
swaying
of
great
countries
and
they
two
lads
pushed
about
by
the
crowd
as
they
stood
and
stared
at
the
soldiers
carried
with
them
that
which
was
even
now
lighting
the
lamp
the
blood
in
the
rat
veins
ran
quickly
and
made
him
feel
hot
as
he
remembered
certain
thoughts
which
had
forced
themselves
into
his
mind
during
the
past
weeks
as
his
brain
had
the
trick
of
working
things
out
it
had
during
the
last
fortnight
at
least
been
following
a
wonderful
even
if
rather
fantastic
and
feverish
fancy
a
mere
trifle
had
set
it
at
work
but
its
labor
once
begun
things
which
might
have
once
seemed
to
be
trifles
appeared
so
no
longer
when
marco
was
asleep
the
rat
lay
awake
through
thrilled
and
sometimes
almost
breathless
midnight
hours
looking
backward
and
recalling
every
detail
of
their
lives
since
they
had
known
each
other
sometimes
it
seemed
to
him
that
almost
everything
he
remembered
the
game
from
first
to
last
above
all
had
pointed
to
but
one
thing
and
then
again
he
would
all
at
once
feel
that
he
was
a
fool
and
had
better
keep
his
head
steady
marco
he
knew
had
no
wild
fancies
he
had
learned
too
much
and
his
mind
was
too
well
balanced
he
did
not
try
to
work
out
things
he
only
thought
of
what
he
was
under
orders
to
do
but
said
the
rat
more
than
once
in
these
midnight
hours
if
it
ever
comes
to
a
draw
whether
he
is
to
be
saved
or
i
am
he
is
the
one
that
must
come
to
no
harm
killing
ca
take
long
and
his
father
sent
me
with
him
this
thought
passed
through
his
mind
as
the
tramping
feet
went
by
as
a
sudden
splendid
burst
of
approaching
music
broke
upon
his
ear
a
queer
look
twisted
his
face
he
realized
the
contrast
between
this
day
and
that
first
morning
behind
the
churchyard
when
he
had
sat
on
his
platform
among
the
squad
and
looked
up
and
saw
marco
in
the
arch
at
the
end
of
the
passage
and
because
he
had
been
and
had
held
himself
so
well
he
had
thrown
a
stone
at
him
yes
blind
fool
that
he
been
his
first
greeting
to
marco
had
been
a
stone
just
because
he
was
what
he
was
as
they
stood
here
in
the
crowd
in
this
foreign
city
it
did
not
seem
as
if
it
could
be
true
that
it
was
he
who
had
done
it
he
managed
to
work
himself
closer
to
marco
side
is
it
splendid
he
said
i
wish
i
was
an
emperor
myself
i
have
these
fellows
out
like
this
every
day
he
said
it
only
because
he
wanted
to
say
something
to
speak
as
a
reason
for
getting
closer
to
him
he
wanted
to
be
near
enough
to
touch
him
and
feel
that
they
were
really
together
and
that
the
whole
thing
was
not
a
sort
of
magnificent
dream
from
which
he
might
awaken
to
find
himself
lying
on
his
heap
of
rags
in
his
corner
of
the
room
in
bone
court
the
crowd
swayed
forward
in
its
eagerness
to
see
the
principal
feature
of
the
pageant
the
emperor
in
his
carriage
the
rat
swayed
forward
with
the
rest
to
look
as
it
passed
a
handsome
and
mustached
personage
in
splendid
uniform
decorated
with
jeweled
orders
and
with
a
cascade
of
plumes
nodding
in
his
military
hat
gravely
saluted
the
shouting
people
on
either
side
by
him
sat
a
man
uniformed
decorated
and
also
but
many
years
younger
marco
arm
touched
the
rat
almost
at
the
same
moment
that
his
own
touched
marco
under
the
nodding
plumes
each
saw
the
rather
tired
and
cynical
pale
face
a
sketch
of
which
was
hidden
in
the
slit
in
sleeve
is
the
one
who
sits
with
the
emperor
an
archduke
marco
asked
the
man
nearest
to
him
in
the
crowd
the
man
answered
amiably
enough
no
he
was
not
but
he
was
a
certain
prince
a
descendant
of
the
one
who
was
the
hero
of
the
day
he
was
a
great
favorite
of
the
emperor
and
was
also
a
great
personage
whose
palace
contained
pictures
celebrated
throughout
europe
he
pretends
it
is
only
pictures
he
cares
for
he
went
on
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
speaking
to
his
wife
who
had
begun
to
listen
but
he
is
a
clever
one
who
amuses
himself
with
things
he
professes
not
to
concern
himself
about
big
things
it
his
way
to
look
bored
and
interested
in
nothing
but
it
said
he
a
wizard
for
knowing
dangerous
secrets
does
he
live
at
the
hofburg
with
the
emperor
asked
the
woman
craning
her
neck
to
look
after
the
imperial
carriage
no
but
he
often
there
the
emperor
is
lonely
and
bored
too
no
doubt
and
this
one
has
ways
of
making
him
forget
his
troubles
been
told
me
that
now
and
then
the
two
dress
themselves
roughly
like
common
men
and
go
out
into
the
city
to
see
what
it
like
to
rub
shoulders
with
the
rest
of
the
world
i
daresay
it
true
i
should
like
to
try
it
myself
once
in
a
while
if
i
had
to
sit
on
a
throne
and
wear
a
crown
the
two
boys
followed
the
celebration
to
its
end
they
managed
to
get
near
enough
to
see
the
entrance
to
the
church
where
the
service
was
held
and
to
get
a
view
of
the
ceremonies
at
the
and
statue
they
saw
the
man
with
the
pale
face
several
times
but
he
was
always
so
enclosed
that
it
was
not
possible
to
get
within
yards
of
him
it
happened
once
however
that
he
looked
through
a
temporary
break
in
the
crowding
people
and
saw
a
dark
and
remarkably
intent
boy
face
whose
vivid
scrutiny
of
him
caught
his
eye
there
was
something
in
the
fixedness
of
its
attention
which
caused
him
to
look
at
it
curiously
for
a
few
seconds
and
marco
met
his
gaze
squarely
look
at
me
look
at
me
the
boy
was
saying
to
him
mentally
i
have
a
message
for
you
a
message
the
tired
eyes
in
the
pale
face
rested
on
him
with
a
certain
growing
light
of
interest
and
curiosity
but
the
crowding
people
moved
and
the
temporary
break
closed
up
so
that
the
two
could
see
each
other
no
more
marco
and
the
rat
were
pushed
backward
by
those
taller
and
stronger
than
themselves
until
they
were
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
let
us
go
to
the
hofburg
said
marco
they
will
come
back
there
and
we
shall
see
him
again
even
if
we
ca
get
near
to
the
hofburg
they
made
their
way
through
the
less
crowded
streets
and
there
they
waited
as
near
to
the
great
palace
as
they
could
get
they
were
there
when
the
ceremonies
at
an
end
the
imperial
carriages
returned
but
though
they
saw
their
man
again
they
were
at
some
distance
from
him
and
he
did
not
see
them
then
followed
four
singular
days
they
were
singular
days
because
they
were
full
of
tantalizing
incidents
nothing
seemed
easier
than
to
hear
talk
of
and
see
the
emperor
favorite
but
nothing
was
more
impossible
than
to
get
near
to
him
he
seemed
rather
a
favorite
with
the
populace
and
the
common
people
of
the
shopkeeping
or
laboring
classes
were
given
to
talking
freely
of
him
of
where
he
was
going
and
what
he
was
doing
he
would
be
sure
to
be
at
this
great
house
or
that
at
this
ball
or
that
banquet
there
was
no
difficulty
in
discovering
that
he
would
be
sure
to
go
to
the
opera
or
the
theatre
or
to
drive
to
schönbrunn
with
his
imperial
master
marco
and
the
rat
heard
casual
speech
of
him
again
and
again
and
from
one
part
of
the
city
to
the
other
they
followed
and
waited
for
him
but
it
was
like
chasing
a
he
was
evidently
too
brilliant
and
important
a
person
to
be
allowed
to
move
about
alone
there
were
always
people
with
him
who
seemed
absorbed
in
his
languid
cynical
talk
marco
thought
that
he
never
seemed
to
care
much
for
his
companions
though
they
on
their
part
always
seemed
highly
entertained
by
what
he
was
saying
it
was
noticeable
that
they
laughed
a
great
deal
though
he
himself
scarcely
even
smiled
he
one
of
those
chaps
with
the
trick
of
saying
witty
things
as
if
he
did
see
the
fun
in
them
himself
the
rat
summed
him
up
chaps
like
that
are
always
cleverer
than
the
other
kind
he
too
high
in
favor
and
too
rich
not
to
be
followed
about
they
heard
a
man
in
a
shop
say
one
day
but
he
gets
tired
of
it
sometimes
when
he
too
bored
to
stand
it
any
longer
he
gives
it
out
that
gone
into
the
mountains
somewhere
and
all
the
time
he
shut
up
alone
with
his
pictures
in
his
own
palace
that
very
night
the
rat
came
in
to
their
attic
looking
pale
and
disappointed
he
had
been
out
to
buy
some
food
after
a
long
and
arduous
day
in
which
they
had
covered
much
ground
had
seen
their
man
three
times
and
each
time
under
circumstances
which
made
him
more
inaccessible
than
ever
they
had
come
back
to
their
poor
quarters
both
tired
and
ravenously
hungry
the
rat
threw
his
purchase
on
to
the
table
and
himself
into
a
chair
he
gone
to
budapest
he
said
how
shall
we
find
him
marco
was
rather
pale
also
and
for
a
moment
he
looked
paler
the
day
had
been
a
hard
one
and
in
their
haste
to
reach
places
at
a
long
distance
from
each
other
they
had
forgotten
their
need
of
food
they
sat
silent
for
a
few
moments
because
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
to
say
we
are
too
tired
and
hungry
to
be
able
to
think
well
marco
said
at
last
let
us
eat
our
supper
and
then
go
to
sleep
until
we
had
a
rest
we
must
go
yes
there
no
good
in
talking
when
you
tired
the
rat
answered
a
trifle
gloomily
you
do
reason
straight
we
must
go
their
meal
was
simple
but
they
ate
well
and
without
words
even
when
they
had
finished
and
undressed
for
the
night
they
said
very
little
where
do
our
thoughts
go
when
we
are
asleep
the
rat
inquired
casually
after
he
was
stretched
out
in
the
darkness
they
must
go
somewhere
let
send
them
to
find
out
what
to
do
next
it
not
as
still
as
it
was
on
the
gaisberg
you
can
hear
the
city
roaring
said
marco
drowsily
from
his
dark
corner
we
must
make
a
ledge
for
ourselves
sleep
made
it
for
them
deep
restful
healthy
sleep
if
they
had
been
more
resentful
of
their
ill
luck
and
lost
labor
it
would
have
come
less
easily
and
have
been
less
natural
in
their
talks
of
strange
things
they
had
learned
that
one
great
secret
of
strength
and
unflagging
courage
is
to
know
how
to
let
go
to
cease
thinking
over
an
anxiety
until
the
right
moment
comes
it
was
their
habit
to
let
go
for
hours
sometimes
and
wander
about
looking
at
places
and
things
galleries
museums
palaces
giving
themselves
up
with
boyish
pleasure
and
eagerness
to
all
they
saw
marco
was
too
intimate
with
the
things
worth
seeing
and
the
rat
too
curious
and
feverishly
to
allow
of
their
missing
much
the
rat
image
of
the
world
had
grown
until
it
seemed
to
know
no
boundaries
which
could
hold
its
wealth
of
wonders
he
wanted
to
go
on
and
on
and
see
them
all
when
marco
opened
his
eyes
in
the
morning
he
found
the
rat
lying
looking
at
him
then
they
both
sat
up
in
bed
at
the
same
time
i
believe
we
are
both
thinking
the
same
thing
marco
said
they
frequently
discovered
that
they
were
thinking
the
same
things
so
do
i
answered
the
rat
it
shows
how
tired
we
were
that
we
think
of
it
last
night
yes
we
are
thinking
the
same
thing
said
marco
we
have
both
remembered
what
we
heard
about
his
shutting
himself
up
alone
with
his
pictures
and
making
people
believe
he
had
gone
away
he
in
his
palace
now
the
rat
announced
do
you
feel
sure
of
that
too
asked
marco
did
you
wake
up
and
feel
sure
of
it
the
first
thing
yes
answered
the
rat
as
sure
as
if
i
heard
him
say
it
himself
so
did
i
said
marco
that
what
our
thoughts
brought
back
to
us
said
the
rat
when
we
go
and
sent
them
off
last
night
he
sat
up
hugging
his
knees
and
looking
straight
before
him
for
some
time
after
this
and
marco
did
not
interrupt
his
meditations
the
day
was
a
brilliant
one
and
though
their
attic
had
only
one
window
the
sun
shone
in
through
it
as
they
ate
their
breakfast
after
it
they
leaned
on
the
window
ledge
and
talked
about
the
garden
they
talked
about
it
because
it
was
a
place
open
to
the
public
and
they
had
walked
round
it
more
than
once
the
palace
which
was
not
a
large
one
stood
in
the
midst
of
it
the
prince
was
enough
to
allow
quiet
and
people
to
saunter
through
it
was
not
a
fashionable
promenade
but
a
pleasant
retreat
for
people
who
sometimes
took
their
work
or
books
and
sat
on
the
seats
placed
here
and
there
among
the
shrubs
and
flowers
when
we
were
there
the
first
time
i
noticed
two
things
marco
said
there
is
a
stone
balcony
which
juts
out
from
the
side
of
the
palace
which
looks
on
the
fountain
garden
that
day
there
were
chairs
on
it
as
if
the
prince
and
his
visitors
sometimes
sat
there
near
it
there
was
a
very
large
evergreen
shrub
and
i
saw
that
there
was
a
hollow
place
inside
it
if
some
one
wanted
to
stay
in
the
gardens
all
night
to
watch
the
windows
when
they
were
lighted
and
see
if
any
one
came
out
alone
upon
the
balcony
he
could
hide
himself
in
the
hollow
place
and
stay
there
until
the
morning
is
there
room
for
two
inside
the
shrub
the
rat
asked
no
i
must
go
alone
said
marco
xxv
a
voice
in
the
night
late
that
afternoon
there
wandered
about
the
gardens
two
quiet
inconspicuous
rather
poorly
dressed
boys
they
looked
at
the
palace
the
shrubs
and
the
as
strangers
usually
did
and
they
sat
on
the
seats
and
talked
as
people
were
accustomed
to
seeing
boys
talk
together
it
was
a
sunny
day
and
exceptionally
warm
and
there
were
more
saunterers
and
sitters
than
usual
which
was
perhaps
the
reason
why
the
at
the
entrance
gates
gave
such
slight
notice
to
the
pair
that
he
did
not
observe
that
though
two
boys
came
in
only
one
went
out
he
did
not
in
fact
remember
when
he
saw
the
rat
swing
by
on
his
crutches
at
that
he
had
entered
in
company
with
a
lad
who
walked
without
any
aid
it
happened
that
when
the
rat
passed
out
the
at
the
entrance
was
much
interested
in
the
aspect
of
the
sky
which
was
curiously
threatening
there
had
been
heavy
clouds
hanging
about
all
day
and
now
and
then
blotting
out
the
sunshine
entirely
but
the
sun
had
refused
to
retire
altogether
just
now
however
the
clouds
had
piled
themselves
in
thunderous
purplish
mountains
and
the
sun
had
been
forced
to
set
behind
them
it
been
a
sort
of
battle
since
morning
the
said
there
will
be
some
crashes
and
cataracts
that
was
what
the
rat
had
thought
when
they
had
sat
in
the
fountain
garden
on
a
seat
which
gave
them
a
good
view
of
the
balcony
and
the
big
evergreen
shrub
which
they
knew
had
the
hollow
in
the
middle
though
its
circumference
was
so
imposing
if
there
should
be
a
big
storm
the
evergreen
will
not
save
you
much
though
it
may
keep
off
the
worst
the
rat
said
i
wish
there
was
room
for
two
he
would
have
wished
there
was
room
for
two
if
he
had
seen
marco
marching
to
the
stake
as
the
gardens
emptied
the
boys
rose
and
walked
round
once
more
as
if
on
their
way
out
by
the
time
they
had
sauntered
toward
the
big
evergreen
nobody
was
in
the
fountain
garden
and
the
last
loiterers
were
moving
toward
the
arched
stone
entrance
to
the
streets
when
they
drew
near
one
side
of
the
evergreen
the
two
were
together
when
the
rat
swung
out
on
the
other
side
of
it
he
was
alone
no
one
noticed
that
anything
had
happened
no
one
looked
back
so
the
rat
swung
down
the
walks
and
round
the
and
passed
into
the
street
and
the
looked
at
the
sky
and
made
his
remark
about
the
crashes
and
cataracts
as
the
darkness
came
on
the
hollow
in
the
shrub
seemed
a
very
safe
place
it
was
not
in
the
least
likely
that
any
one
would
enter
the
closed
gardens
and
if
by
rare
chance
some
servant
passed
through
he
would
not
be
in
search
of
people
who
wished
to
watch
all
night
in
the
middle
of
an
evergreen
instead
of
going
to
bed
and
to
sleep
the
hollow
was
well
inclosed
with
greenery
and
there
was
room
to
sit
down
when
one
was
tired
of
standing
marco
stood
for
a
long
time
because
by
doing
so
he
could
see
plainly
the
windows
opening
on
the
balcony
if
he
gently
pushed
aside
some
flexible
young
boughs
he
had
managed
to
discover
in
his
first
visit
to
the
gardens
that
the
windows
overlooking
the
fountain
garden
were
those
which
belonged
to
the
prince
own
suite
of
rooms
those
which
opened
on
to
the
balcony
lighted
his
favorite
apartment
which
contained
his
books
and
pictures
and
in
which
he
spent
most
of
his
secluded
leisure
hours
marco
watched
these
windows
anxiously
if
the
prince
had
not
gone
to
budapest
if
he
were
really
only
in
retreat
and
hiding
from
his
gay
world
among
his
treasures
he
would
be
living
in
his
favorite
rooms
and
lights
would
show
themselves
and
if
there
were
lights
he
might
pass
before
a
window
because
since
he
was
inclosed
in
his
garden
he
need
not
fear
being
seen
the
twilight
deepened
into
darkness
and
because
of
the
heavy
clouds
it
was
very
dense
faint
gleams
showed
themselves
in
the
lower
part
of
the
palace
but
none
was
lighted
in
the
windows
marco
watched
he
waited
so
long
that
it
became
evident
that
none
was
to
be
lighted
at
all
at
last
he
loosed
his
hold
on
the
young
boughs
and
after
standing
a
few
moments
in
thought
sat
down
upon
the
earth
in
the
midst
of
his
embowered
tent
the
prince
was
not
in
his
retreat
he
was
probably
not
in
vienna
and
the
rumor
of
his
journey
to
budapest
had
no
doubt
been
true
so
much
time
lost
through
making
a
mistake
but
it
was
best
to
have
made
the
venture
not
to
have
made
it
would
have
been
to
lose
a
chance
the
entrance
was
closed
for
the
night
and
there
was
no
getting
out
of
the
gardens
until
they
were
opened
for
the
next
day
he
must
stay
in
his
until
the
time
when
people
began
to
come
and
bring
their
books
and
knitting
and
sit
on
the
seats
then
he
could
stroll
out
without
attracting
attention
but
he
had
the
night
before
him
to
spend
as
best
he
could
that
would
not
matter
at
all
he
could
tuck
his
cap
under
his
head
and
go
to
sleep
on
the
ground
he
could
command
himself
to
waken
once
every
and
look
for
the
lights
he
would
not
go
to
sleep
until
it
was
long
past
midnight
so
long
past
that
there
would
not
be
one
chance
in
a
hundred
that
anything
could
happen
but
the
clouds
which
made
the
night
so
dark
were
giving
forth
low
rumbling
growls
at
intervals
a
threatening
gleam
of
light
shot
across
them
and
a
sudden
swish
of
wind
rushed
through
the
trees
in
the
garden
this
happened
several
times
and
then
marco
began
to
hear
the
patter
of
raindrops
they
were
heavy
and
big
drops
but
few
at
first
and
then
there
was
a
new
and
more
powerful
rush
of
wind
a
jagged
dart
of
light
in
the
sky
and
a
tremendous
crash
after
that
the
clouds
tore
themselves
open
and
poured
forth
their
contents
in
floods
after
the
protracted
struggle
of
the
day
it
all
seemed
to
happen
at
once
as
if
a
horde
of
huge
lions
had
at
one
moment
been
let
loose
flame
after
flame
of
lightning
roar
and
crash
and
sharp
reports
of
thunder
shrieks
of
hurricane
wind
torrents
of
rain
as
if
some
of
the
skies
had
gathered
and
rushed
and
burst
upon
the
earth
it
was
such
a
storm
as
people
remember
for
a
lifetime
and
which
in
few
lifetimes
is
seen
at
all
marco
stood
still
in
the
midst
of
the
rage
and
flooding
blinding
roar
of
it
after
the
first
few
minutes
he
knew
he
could
do
nothing
to
shield
himself
down
the
garden
paths
he
heard
cataracts
rushing
he
held
his
cap
pressed
against
his
eyes
because
he
seemed
to
stand
in
the
midst
of
darting
flames
the
crashes
cannon
reports
and
thunderings
and
the
jagged
streams
of
light
came
so
close
to
one
another
that
he
seemed
deafened
as
well
as
blinded
he
wondered
if
he
should
ever
be
able
to
hear
human
voices
again
when
it
was
over
that
he
was
drenched
to
the
skin
and
that
the
water
poured
from
his
clothes
as
if
he
were
himself
a
cataract
was
so
small
a
detail
that
he
was
scarcely
aware
of
it
he
stood
still
bracing
his
body
and
waited
if
he
had
been
a
samavian
soldier
in
the
trenches
and
such
a
storm
had
broken
upon
him
and
his
comrades
they
could
only
have
braced
themselves
and
waited
this
was
what
he
found
himself
thinking
when
the
tumult
and
downpour
were
at
their
worst
there
were
men
who
had
waited
in
the
midst
of
a
rain
of
bullets
it
was
not
long
after
this
thought
had
come
to
him
that
there
occurred
the
first
temporary
lull
in
the
storm
its
fury
perhaps
reached
its
height
and
broke
at
that
moment
a
yellow
flame
had
torn
its
jagged
way
across
the
heavens
and
an
crash
had
thundered
itself
into
rumblings
which
actually
died
away
before
breaking
forth
again
marco
took
his
cap
from
his
eyes
and
drew
a
long
breath
he
drew
two
long
breaths
it
was
as
he
began
drawing
a
third
and
realizing
the
strange
feeling
of
the
almost
stillness
about
him
that
he
heard
a
new
kind
of
sound
at
the
side
of
the
garden
nearest
his
it
sounded
like
the
creak
of
a
door
opening
somewhere
in
the
wall
behind
the
laurel
hedge
some
one
was
coming
into
the
garden
by
a
private
entrance
he
pushed
aside
the
young
boughs
again
and
tried
to
see
but
the
darkness
was
too
dense
yet
he
could
hear
if
the
thunder
would
not
break
again
there
was
the
sound
of
feet
on
the
wet
gravel
the
footsteps
of
more
than
one
person
coming
toward
where
he
stood
but
not
as
if
afraid
of
being
heard
merely
as
if
they
were
at
liberty
to
come
in
by
what
entrance
they
chose
marco
remained
very
still
a
sudden
hope
gave
him
a
shock
of
joy
if
the
man
with
the
tired
face
chose
to
hide
himself
from
his
acquaintances
he
might
choose
to
go
in
and
out
by
a
private
entrance
the
footsteps
drew
near
crushing
the
wet
gravel
passed
by
and
seemed
to
pause
somewhere
near
the
balcony
and
them
flame
lit
up
the
sky
again
and
the
thunder
burst
forth
once
more
but
this
was
its
last
great
peal
the
storm
was
at
an
end
only
fainter
and
fainter
rumblings
and
mutterings
and
paler
and
paler
darts
followed
even
they
were
soon
over
and
the
cataracts
in
the
paths
had
rushed
themselves
silent
but
the
darkness
was
still
deep
it
was
deep
to
blackness
in
the
hollow
of
the
evergreen
marco
stood
in
it
streaming
with
rain
but
feeling
nothing
because
he
was
full
of
thought
he
pushed
aside
his
greenery
and
kept
his
eyes
on
the
place
in
the
blackness
where
the
windows
must
be
though
he
could
not
see
them
it
seemed
that
he
waited
a
long
time
but
he
knew
it
only
seemed
so
really
he
began
to
breathe
quickly
because
he
was
waiting
for
something
suddenly
he
saw
exactly
where
the
windows
were
because
they
were
all
lighted
his
feeling
of
relief
was
great
but
it
did
not
last
very
long
it
was
true
that
something
had
been
gained
in
the
certainty
that
his
man
had
not
left
vienna
but
what
next
it
would
not
be
so
easy
to
follow
him
if
he
chose
only
to
go
out
secretly
at
night
what
next
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
night
watching
a
lighted
window
was
not
enough
night
it
might
not
be
lighted
but
he
kept
his
gaze
fixed
upon
it
he
tried
to
fix
all
his
will
and
on
the
person
inside
the
room
perhaps
he
could
reach
him
and
make
him
listen
even
though
he
would
not
know
that
any
one
was
speaking
to
him
he
knew
that
thoughts
were
strong
things
if
angry
thoughts
in
one
man
mind
will
create
anger
in
the
mind
of
another
why
should
not
sane
messages
cross
the
line
i
must
speak
to
you
i
must
speak
to
you
he
found
himself
saying
in
a
low
intense
voice
i
am
outside
here
waiting
listen
i
must
speak
to
you
he
said
it
many
times
and
kept
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
window
which
opened
on
to
the
balcony
once
he
saw
a
man
figure
cross
the
room
but
he
could
not
be
sure
who
it
was
the
last
distant
rumblings
of
thunder
had
died
away
and
the
clouds
were
breaking
it
was
not
long
before
the
dark
mountainous
billows
broke
apart
and
a
brilliant
full
moon
showed
herself
sailing
in
the
rift
suddenly
flooding
everything
with
light
parts
of
the
garden
were
silver
white
and
the
tree
shadows
were
like
black
velvet
a
silvery
lance
pierced
even
into
the
hollow
of
evergreen
and
struck
across
his
face
perhaps
it
was
this
sudden
change
which
attracted
the
attention
of
those
inside
the
balconied
room
a
man
figure
appeared
at
the
long
windows
marco
saw
now
that
it
was
the
prince
he
opened
the
windows
and
stepped
out
on
to
the
balcony
it
is
all
over
he
said
quietly
and
he
stood
with
his
face
lifted
looking
at
the
great
white
sailing
moon
he
stood
very
still
and
seemed
for
the
moment
to
forget
the
world
and
himself
it
was
a
wonderful
triumphant
queen
of
a
moon
but
something
brought
him
back
to
earth
a
low
but
strong
and
clear
came
up
to
him
from
the
garden
path
below
the
lamp
is
lighted
the
lamp
is
lighted
it
said
and
the
words
sounded
almost
as
if
some
one
were
uttering
a
prayer
they
seemed
to
call
to
him
to
arrest
him
to
draw
him
he
stood
still
a
few
seconds
in
dead
silence
then
he
bent
over
the
balustrade
the
moonlight
had
not
broken
the
darkness
below
that
is
a
boy
voice
he
said
in
a
low
tone
but
i
can
not
see
who
is
speaking
yes
it
is
a
boy
voice
it
answered
in
a
way
which
somehow
moved
him
because
it
was
so
ardent
it
is
the
son
of
stefan
loristan
the
lamp
is
lighted
illustration
it
is
the
son
of
stefan
loristan
the
lamp
is
lighted
wait
i
am
coming
down
to
you
the
prince
said
in
a
few
minutes
marco
heard
a
door
open
gently
not
far
from
where
he
stood
then
the
man
he
had
been
following
so
many
days
appeared
at
his
side
how
long
have
you
been
here
he
asked
before
the
gates
closed
i
hid
myself
in
the
hollow
of
the
big
shrub
there
highness
marco
answered
then
you
were
out
in
the
storm
yes
highness
the
prince
put
his
hand
on
the
boy
shoulder
i
can
not
see
you
but
it
is
best
to
stand
in
the
shadow
you
are
drenched
to
the
skin
i
have
been
able
to
give
your
highness
the
sign
marco
whispered
a
storm
is
nothing
there
was
a
silence
marco
knew
that
his
companion
was
pausing
to
turn
something
over
in
his
mind
he
said
slowly
at
length
the
lamp
is
lighted
and
are
sent
to
bear
the
sign
something
in
his
voice
made
marco
feel
that
he
was
smiling
what
a
race
you
are
what
a
race
you
samavian
loristans
he
paused
as
if
to
think
the
thing
over
again
i
want
to
see
your
face
he
said
next
here
is
a
tree
with
a
shaft
of
moonlight
striking
through
the
branches
let
us
step
aside
and
stand
under
it
marco
did
as
he
was
told
the
shaft
of
moonlight
fell
upon
his
uplifted
face
and
showed
its
young
strength
and
darkness
quite
splendid
for
the
moment
in
a
triumphant
glow
of
joy
in
obstacles
overcome
raindrops
hung
on
his
hair
but
he
did
not
look
draggled
only
very
wet
and
picturesque
he
had
reached
his
man
he
had
given
the
sign
the
prince
looked
him
over
with
interested
curiosity
yes
he
said
in
his
cool
rather
dragging
voice
you
are
the
son
of
stefan
loristan
also
you
must
be
taken
care
of
you
must
come
with
me
i
have
trained
my
household
to
remain
in
its
own
quarters
until
i
require
its
service
i
have
attached
to
my
own
apartments
a
good
safe
little
room
where
i
sometimes
keep
people
you
can
dry
your
clothes
and
sleep
there
when
the
gardens
are
opened
again
the
rest
will
be
easy
but
though
he
stepped
out
from
under
the
trees
and
began
to
move
towards
the
palace
in
the
shadow
marco
noticed
that
he
moved
hesitatingly
as
if
he
had
not
quite
decided
what
he
should
do
he
stopped
rather
suddenly
and
turned
again
to
marco
who
was
following
him
there
is
some
one
in
the
room
i
just
now
left
he
said
an
old
man
whom
it
might
interest
to
see
you
it
might
also
be
a
good
thing
for
him
to
feel
interest
in
you
i
choose
that
he
shall
see
you
as
you
are
i
am
at
your
command
highness
marco
answered
he
knew
his
companion
was
smiling
again
you
have
been
in
training
for
more
centuries
than
you
know
he
said
and
your
father
has
prepared
you
to
encounter
the
unexpected
without
surprise
they
passed
under
the
balcony
and
paused
at
a
low
stone
doorway
hidden
behind
shrubs
the
door
was
a
beautiful
one
marco
saw
when
it
was
opened
and
the
corridor
disclosed
was
beautiful
also
though
it
had
an
air
of
quiet
and
aloofness
which
was
not
so
much
secret
as
private
a
perfect
though
narrow
staircase
mounted
from
it
to
the
next
floor
after
ascending
it
the
prince
led
the
way
through
a
short
corridor
and
stopped
at
the
door
at
the
end
of
it
we
are
going
in
here
he
said
it
was
a
wonderful
room
the
one
which
opened
on
to
the
balcony
each
piece
of
furniture
in
it
the
hangings
the
tapestries
and
pictures
on
the
wall
were
all
such
as
might
well
have
found
themselves
adorning
a
museum
marco
remembered
the
common
report
of
his
escort
favorite
amusement
of
collecting
wonders
and
furnishing
his
house
with
the
things
others
exhibited
only
as
marvels
of
art
and
handicraft
the
place
was
rich
and
mellow
with
exquisitely
chosen
beauties
in
a
massive
chair
upon
the
hearth
sat
a
figure
with
bent
head
it
was
a
tall
old
man
with
white
hair
and
moustache
his
elbows
rested
upon
the
arm
of
his
chair
and
he
leaned
his
forehead
on
his
hand
as
if
he
were
weary
marco
companion
crossed
the
room
and
stood
beside
him
speaking
in
a
lowered
voice
marco
could
not
at
first
hear
what
he
said
he
himself
stood
quite
still
waiting
the
man
lifted
his
head
and
listened
it
seemed
as
though
almost
at
once
he
was
singularly
interested
the
lowered
voice
was
slightly
raised
at
last
and
marco
heard
the
last
two
sentences
the
only
son
of
stefan
loristan
look
at
him
the
old
man
in
the
chair
turned
slowly
and
looked
steadily
and
with
questioning
curiosity
touched
with
grave
surprise
he
had
keen
and
clear
blue
eyes
then
marco
still
erect
and
silent
waited
again
the
prince
had
merely
said
to
him
an
old
man
whom
it
might
interest
to
see
you
he
had
plainly
intended
that
whatsoever
happened
he
must
make
no
outward
sign
of
seeing
more
than
he
had
been
told
he
would
see
an
old
man
it
was
for
him
to
show
no
astonishment
or
recognition
he
had
been
brought
here
not
to
see
but
to
be
seen
the
power
of
remaining
still
under
scrutiny
which
the
rat
had
often
envied
him
stood
now
in
good
stead
because
he
had
seen
the
white
head
and
tall
form
not
many
days
before
surmounted
by
brilliant
emerald
plumes
hung
with
jeweled
decorations
in
the
royal
carriage
escorted
by
banners
and
helmets
and
following
troops
whose
tramping
feet
kept
time
to
bursts
of
military
music
while
the
populace
bared
their
heads
and
cheered
he
is
like
his
father
this
personage
said
to
the
prince
but
if
any
one
but
loristan
had
sent
him
his
looks
please
me
then
suddenly
to
marco
you
were
waiting
outside
while
the
storm
was
going
on
yes
sir
marco
answered
then
the
two
exchanged
some
words
still
in
the
lowered
voice
you
read
the
news
as
you
made
your
journey
he
was
asked
you
know
how
samavia
stands
she
does
not
stand
said
marco
the
iarovitch
and
the
maranovitch
have
fought
as
hyenas
fight
until
each
has
torn
the
other
into
fragments
and
neither
has
blood
or
strength
left
the
two
glanced
at
each
other
a
good
simile
said
the
older
person
you
are
right
if
a
strong
party
rose
and
a
greater
power
chose
not
to
interfere
the
country
might
see
better
days
he
looked
at
him
a
few
moments
longer
and
then
waved
his
hand
kindly
you
are
a
fine
samavian
he
said
i
am
glad
of
that
you
may
go
good
night
marco
bowed
respectfully
and
the
man
with
the
tired
face
led
him
out
of
the
room
it
was
just
before
he
left
him
in
the
small
quiet
chamber
in
which
he
was
to
sleep
that
the
prince
gave
him
a
final
curious
glance
i
remember
now
he
said
in
the
room
when
you
answered
the
question
about
samavia
i
was
sure
that
i
had
seen
you
before
it
was
the
day
of
the
celebration
there
was
a
break
in
the
crowd
and
i
saw
a
boy
looking
at
me
it
was
you
yes
said
marco
i
have
followed
you
each
time
you
have
gone
out
since
then
but
i
could
never
get
near
enough
to
speak
seemed
only
one
chance
in
a
thousand
you
are
doing
your
work
more
like
a
man
than
a
boy
was
the
next
speech
and
it
was
made
reflectively
no
man
could
have
behaved
more
perfectly
than
you
did
just
now
when
discretion
and
composure
were
necessary
then
after
a
moment
pause
he
was
deeply
interested
and
deeply
pleased
good
night
when
the
gardens
had
been
thrown
open
the
next
morning
and
people
were
passing
in
and
out
again
marco
passed
out
also
he
was
obliged
to
tell
himself
two
or
three
times
that
he
had
not
wakened
from
an
amazing
dream
he
quickened
his
pace
after
he
had
crossed
the
street
because
he
wanted
to
get
home
to
the
attic
and
talk
to
the
rat
there
was
a
narrow
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
pass
through
if
he
wished
to
make
a
short
cut
as
he
turned
into
it
he
saw
a
curious
figure
leaning
on
crutches
against
a
wall
it
looked
damp
and
forlorn
and
he
wondered
if
it
could
be
a
beggar
it
was
not
it
was
the
rat
who
suddenly
saw
who
was
approaching
and
swung
forward
his
face
was
pale
and
haggard
and
he
looked
worn
and
frightened
he
dragged
off
his
cap
and
spoke
in
a
voice
which
was
hoarse
as
a
crow
god
be
thanked
he
said
god
be
thanked
as
people
always
said
it
when
they
received
the
sign
alone
but
there
was
a
kind
of
anguish
in
his
voice
as
well
as
relief
marco
cried
out
the
rat
had
begged
him
to
call
him
so
what
have
you
been
doing
how
long
have
you
been
here
ever
since
i
left
you
last
night
said
the
rat
clutching
tremblingly
at
his
arm
as
if
to
make
sure
he
was
real
if
there
was
not
room
for
two
in
the
hollow
there
was
room
for
one
in
the
street
was
it
my
place
to
go
off
duty
and
leave
you
alone
was
it
you
were
out
in
the
storm
were
you
said
the
rat
fiercely
i
huddled
against
the
wall
as
well
as
i
could
what
did
i
care
crutches
do
prevent
a
fellow
waiting
i
would
have
left
you
if
you
given
me
orders
and
that
would
have
been
mutiny
when
you
did
not
come
out
as
soon
as
the
gates
opened
i
felt
as
if
my
head
got
on
fire
how
could
i
know
what
had
happened
i
not
the
nerve
and
backbone
you
have
i
go
half
mad
for
a
second
or
so
marco
did
not
answer
but
when
he
put
his
hand
on
the
damp
sleeve
the
rat
actually
started
because
it
seemed
as
though
he
were
looking
into
the
eyes
of
stefan
loristan
you
look
just
like
your
father
he
exclaimed
in
spite
of
himself
how
tall
you
are
when
you
are
near
me
marco
said
in
loristan
own
voice
when
you
are
near
me
i
feel
i
feel
as
if
i
were
a
royal
prince
attended
by
an
army
you
my
army
and
he
pulled
off
his
cap
with
quick
boyishness
and
added
god
be
thanked
the
sun
was
warm
in
the
attic
window
when
they
reached
their
lodging
and
the
two
leaned
on
the
rough
sill
as
marco
told
his
story
it
took
some
time
to
relate
and
when
he
ended
he
took
an
envelope
from
his
pocket
and
showed
it
to
the
rat
it
contained
a
flat
package
of
money
he
gave
it
to
me
just
before
he
opened
the
private
door
marco
explained
and
he
said
to
me
will
not
be
long
now
after
samavia
go
back
to
london
as
quickly
as
you
can
quickly
as
you
i
wonder
what
he
meant
the
rat
said
slowly
a
tremendous
thought
had
shot
through
his
mind
but
it
was
not
a
thought
he
could
speak
of
to
marco
i
can
not
tell
i
thought
that
it
was
for
some
reason
he
did
not
expect
me
to
know
marco
said
we
will
do
as
he
told
us
as
quickly
as
we
can
they
looked
over
the
newspapers
as
they
did
every
day
all
that
could
be
gathered
from
any
of
them
was
that
the
opposing
armies
of
samavia
seemed
each
to
have
reached
the
culmination
of
disaster
and
exhaustion
which
party
had
the
power
left
to
take
any
final
step
which
could
call
itself
a
victory
it
was
impossible
to
say
never
had
a
country
been
in
a
more
desperate
case
it
is
the
time
said
the
rat
glowering
over
his
map
if
the
secret
party
rises
suddenly
now
it
can
take
melzarr
almost
without
a
blow
it
can
sweep
through
the
country
and
disarm
both
armies
weakened
they
half
starved
they
bleeding
to
death
they
to
be
disarmed
only
the
iarovitch
and
the
maranovitch
keep
on
with
the
struggle
because
each
is
fighting
for
the
power
to
tax
the
people
and
make
slaves
of
them
if
the
secret
party
does
not
rise
the
people
will
and
they
rush
on
the
palaces
and
kill
every
maranovitch
and
iarovitch
they
find
and
serve
them
right
let
us
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
in
studying
the
again
said
marco
we
must
be
on
the
way
to
samavia
xxvi
across
the
frontier
that
one
day
a
week
later
two
tired
and
should
drag
themselves
with
slow
and
weary
feet
across
the
frontier
line
between
jiardasia
and
samavia
was
not
an
incident
to
awaken
suspicion
or
even
to
attract
attention
war
and
hunger
and
anguish
had
left
the
country
stunned
and
broken
since
the
worst
had
happened
no
one
was
curious
as
to
what
would
befall
them
next
if
jiardasia
herself
had
become
a
foe
instead
of
a
friendly
neighbor
and
had
sent
across
the
border
galloping
hordes
of
soldiery
there
would
only
have
been
more
shrieks
and
and
slaughter
which
no
one
dare
resist
but
so
far
jiardasia
had
remained
peaceful
the
two
boys
one
of
them
on
crutches
had
evidently
traveled
far
on
foot
their
poor
clothes
were
dusty
and
and
they
stopped
and
asked
for
water
at
the
first
hut
across
the
line
the
one
who
walked
without
crutches
had
some
coarse
bread
in
a
bag
slung
over
his
shoulder
and
they
sat
on
the
roadside
and
ate
it
as
if
they
were
hungry
the
old
grandmother
who
lived
alone
in
the
hut
sat
and
stared
at
them
without
any
curiosity
she
may
have
vaguely
wondered
why
any
one
crossed
into
samavia
in
these
days
but
she
did
not
care
to
know
their
reason
her
big
son
had
lived
in
a
village
which
belonged
to
the
maranovitch
and
he
had
been
called
out
to
fight
for
his
lords
he
had
not
wanted
to
fight
and
had
not
known
what
the
quarrel
was
about
but
he
was
forced
to
obey
he
had
kissed
his
handsome
wife
and
four
sturdy
children
blubbering
aloud
when
he
left
them
his
village
and
his
good
crops
and
his
house
must
be
left
behind
then
the
iarovitch
swept
through
the
pretty
little
cluster
of
homesteads
which
belonged
to
their
enemy
they
were
mad
with
rage
because
they
had
met
with
great
losses
in
a
battle
not
far
away
and
as
they
swooped
through
they
burned
and
killed
and
trampled
down
fields
and
vineyards
the
old
woman
son
never
saw
either
the
burned
walls
of
his
house
or
the
bodies
of
his
wife
and
children
because
he
had
been
killed
himself
in
the
battle
for
which
the
iarovitch
were
revenging
themselves
only
the
old
grandmother
who
lived
in
the
hut
near
the
frontier
line
and
stared
vacantly
at
the
remained
alive
she
wearily
gazed
at
people
and
wondered
why
she
did
not
hear
news
from
her
son
and
her
grandchildren
but
that
was
all
when
the
boys
were
over
the
frontier
and
well
on
their
way
along
the
roads
it
was
not
difficult
to
keep
out
of
sight
if
it
seemed
necessary
the
country
was
mountainous
and
there
were
deep
and
thick
forests
by
the
way
forests
so
and
with
such
thick
undergrowth
that
men
could
easily
have
hidden
themselves
it
was
because
of
this
perhaps
that
this
part
of
the
country
had
seen
little
fighting
there
was
too
great
opportunity
for
secure
ambush
for
a
foe
as
the
two
travelers
went
on
they
heard
of
burned
villages
and
towns
destroyed
but
they
were
towns
and
villages
nearer
melzarr
and
other
cities
or
they
were
in
the
country
surrounding
the
castles
and
estates
of
powerful
nobles
and
leaders
it
was
true
as
marco
had
said
to
the
personage
that
the
maranovitch
and
iarovitch
had
fought
with
the
savageness
of
hyenas
until
at
last
the
forces
of
each
side
lay
torn
and
bleeding
their
strength
their
resources
their
supplies
exhausted
each
day
left
them
weaker
and
more
desperate
europe
looked
on
with
small
interest
in
either
party
but
with
growing
desire
that
the
disorder
should
end
and
cease
to
interfere
with
commerce
all
this
and
much
more
marco
and
the
rat
knew
but
as
they
made
their
cautious
way
through
byways
of
the
maimed
and
tortured
little
country
they
learned
other
things
they
learned
that
the
stories
of
its
beauty
and
fertility
were
not
romances
its
mountains
its
immense
plains
of
rich
verdure
on
which
flocks
and
herds
might
have
fed
by
thousands
its
splendor
of
deep
forest
and
broad
clear
rushing
rivers
had
a
primeval
majesty
such
as
the
first
human
creatures
might
have
found
on
earth
in
the
days
of
the
garden
of
eden
the
two
boys
traveled
through
forest
and
woodland
when
it
was
possible
to
leave
the
road
it
was
safe
to
thread
a
way
among
huge
trees
and
tall
ferns
and
young
saplings
it
was
not
always
easy
but
it
was
safe
sometimes
they
saw
a
hut
or
a
shelter
where
a
shepherd
was
hiding
with
the
few
sheep
left
to
him
each
man
they
met
wore
the
same
look
of
stony
suffering
in
his
face
but
when
the
boys
begged
for
bread
and
water
as
was
their
habit
no
one
refused
to
share
the
little
he
had
it
soon
became
plain
to
them
that
they
were
thought
to
be
two
young
fugitives
whose
homes
had
probably
been
destroyed
and
who
were
wandering
about
with
no
thought
but
that
of
finding
safety
until
the
worst
was
over
that
one
of
them
traveled
on
crutches
added
to
their
apparent
helplessness
and
that
he
could
not
speak
the
language
of
the
country
made
him
more
an
object
of
pity
the
peasants
did
not
know
what
language
he
spoke
sometimes
a
foreigner
came
to
find
work
in
this
small
town
or
that
the
poor
lad
might
have
come
to
the
country
with
his
father
and
mother
and
then
have
been
caught
in
the
whirlpool
of
war
and
tossed
out
on
the
world
but
no
one
asked
questions
even
in
their
desolation
they
were
silent
and
noble
people
who
were
too
courteous
for
curiosity
in
the
old
days
they
were
simple
and
stately
and
kind
all
doors
were
open
to
travelers
the
master
of
the
poorest
hut
uttered
a
blessing
and
a
welcome
when
a
stranger
crossed
his
threshold
it
was
the
custom
of
the
country
marco
said
i
read
about
it
in
a
book
of
my
father
about
most
of
the
doors
the
welcome
was
carved
in
stone
it
was
this
blessing
of
the
son
of
god
and
rest
within
these
walls
they
are
big
and
strong
said
the
rat
and
they
have
good
faces
they
carry
themselves
as
if
they
had
been
drilled
both
men
and
women
it
was
not
through
the
part
of
the
unhappy
land
their
way
led
them
but
they
saw
hunger
and
dread
in
the
villages
they
passed
crops
which
should
have
fed
the
people
had
been
taken
from
them
for
the
use
of
the
army
flocks
and
herds
had
been
driven
away
and
faces
were
gaunt
and
gray
those
who
had
as
yet
only
lost
crops
and
herds
knew
that
homes
and
lives
might
be
torn
from
them
at
any
moment
only
old
men
and
women
and
children
were
left
to
wait
for
any
fate
which
the
chances
of
war
might
deal
out
to
them
when
they
were
given
food
from
some
poor
store
marco
would
offer
a
little
money
in
return
he
dare
not
excite
suspicion
by
offering
much
he
was
obliged
to
let
it
be
imagined
that
in
his
flight
from
his
ruined
home
he
had
been
able
to
snatch
at
and
secrete
some
poor
hoard
which
might
save
him
from
starvation
often
the
women
would
not
take
what
he
offered
their
journey
was
a
hard
and
hungry
one
they
must
make
it
all
on
foot
and
there
was
little
food
to
be
found
but
each
of
them
knew
how
to
live
on
scant
fare
they
traveled
mostly
by
night
and
slept
among
the
ferns
and
undergrowth
through
the
day
they
drank
from
running
brooks
and
bathed
in
them
moss
and
ferns
made
soft
and
beds
and
trees
roofed
them
sometimes
they
lay
long
and
talked
while
they
rested
and
at
length
a
day
came
when
they
knew
they
were
nearing
their
journey
end
it
is
nearly
over
now
marco
said
after
they
had
thrown
themselves
down
in
the
forest
in
the
early
hours
of
one
dewy
morning
he
said
samavia
go
back
to
london
as
quickly
as
you
can
quickly
as
you
he
said
it
twice
as
if
something
were
going
to
happen
perhaps
it
will
happen
more
suddenly
than
we
think
the
thing
he
meant
answered
the
rat
suddenly
he
sat
up
on
his
elbow
and
leaned
towards
marco
we
are
in
samavia
he
said
we
two
are
in
samavia
and
we
are
near
the
end
marco
rose
on
his
elbow
also
he
was
very
thin
as
a
result
of
hard
travel
and
scant
feeding
his
thinness
made
his
eyes
look
immense
and
black
as
pits
but
they
burned
and
were
beautiful
with
their
own
fire
yes
he
said
breathing
quickly
and
though
we
do
not
know
what
the
end
will
be
we
have
obeyed
orders
the
prince
was
next
to
the
last
one
there
is
only
one
more
the
old
priest
i
have
wanted
to
see
him
more
than
i
have
wanted
to
see
any
of
the
others
the
rat
said
so
have
i
marco
answered
his
church
is
built
on
the
side
of
this
mountain
i
wonder
what
he
will
say
to
us
both
had
the
same
reason
for
wanting
to
see
him
in
his
youth
he
had
served
in
the
monastery
over
the
frontier
the
one
which
till
it
was
destroyed
in
a
revolt
had
treasured
the
story
of
the
beautiful
royal
lad
brought
to
be
hidden
among
the
brotherhood
by
the
ancient
shepherd
in
the
monastery
the
memory
of
the
lost
prince
was
as
the
memory
of
a
saint
it
had
been
told
that
one
of
the
early
brothers
who
was
a
decorator
and
a
painter
had
made
a
picture
of
him
with
a
faint
halo
shining
about
his
head
the
young
acolyte
who
had
served
there
must
have
heard
wonderful
legends
but
the
monastery
had
been
burned
and
the
young
acolyte
had
in
later
years
crossed
the
frontier
and
become
the
priest
of
a
few
mountaineers
whose
little
church
clung
to
the
mountain
side
he
had
worked
hard
and
faithfully
and
was
worshipped
by
his
people
only
the
secret
forgers
of
the
sword
knew
that
his
most
ardent
worshippers
were
those
with
whom
he
prayed
and
to
whom
he
gave
blessings
in
dark
caverns
under
the
earth
where
arms
piled
themselves
and
men
with
dark
strong
faces
sat
together
in
the
dim
light
and
laid
plans
and
wrought
schemes
this
marco
and
the
rat
did
not
know
as
they
talked
of
their
desire
to
see
him
he
may
not
choose
to
tell
us
anything
said
marco
when
we
have
given
him
the
sign
he
may
turn
away
and
say
nothing
as
some
of
the
others
did
he
may
have
nothing
to
say
which
we
should
hear
silence
may
be
the
order
for
him
too
it
would
not
be
a
long
or
dangerous
climb
to
the
little
church
on
the
rock
they
could
sleep
or
rest
all
day
and
begin
it
at
twilight
so
after
they
had
talked
of
the
old
priest
and
had
eaten
their
black
bread
they
settled
themselves
to
sleep
under
cover
of
the
thick
tall
ferns
it
was
a
long
and
deep
sleep
which
nothing
disturbed
so
few
human
beings
ever
climbed
the
hill
except
by
the
narrow
rough
path
leading
to
the
church
that
the
little
wild
creatures
had
not
learned
to
be
afraid
of
them
once
during
the
afternoon
a
hare
hopping
along
under
the
ferns
to
make
a
visit
stopped
by
marco
head
and
after
looking
at
him
a
few
seconds
with
his
lustrous
eyes
began
to
nibble
the
ends
of
his
hair
he
only
did
it
from
curiosity
and
because
he
wondered
if
it
might
be
a
new
kind
of
grass
but
he
did
not
like
it
and
stopped
nibbling
almost
at
once
after
which
he
looked
at
it
again
moving
the
soft
sensitive
end
of
his
nose
rapidly
for
a
second
or
so
and
then
hopped
away
to
attend
to
his
own
affairs
a
very
large
and
handsome
green
crawled
from
one
end
of
the
rat
crutches
to
the
other
but
having
done
it
he
went
away
also
two
or
three
times
a
bird
searching
for
his
dinner
under
the
ferns
was
surprised
to
find
the
two
sleeping
figures
but
as
they
lay
so
quietly
there
seemed
nothing
to
be
frightened
about
a
beautiful
little
field
mouse
running
past
discovered
that
there
were
crumbs
lying
about
and
ate
all
she
could
find
on
the
moss
after
that
she
crept
into
marco
pocket
and
found
some
excellent
ones
and
had
quite
a
feast
but
she
disturbed
nobody
and
the
boys
slept
on
it
was
a
bird
evening
song
which
awakened
them
both
the
bird
alighted
on
the
branch
of
a
tree
near
them
and
her
trill
was
rippling
clear
and
sweet
the
evening
air
had
freshened
and
was
fragrant
with
hillside
scents
when
marco
first
rolled
over
and
opened
his
eyes
he
thought
the
most
delicious
thing
on
earth
was
to
waken
from
sleep
on
a
hillside
at
evening
and
hear
a
bird
singing
it
seemed
to
make
exquisitely
real
to
him
the
fact
that
he
was
in
samavia
that
the
lamp
was
lighted
and
his
work
was
nearly
done
the
rat
awakened
when
he
did
and
for
a
few
minutes
both
lay
on
their
backs
without
speaking
at
last
marco
said
the
stars
are
coming
out
we
can
begin
to
climb
then
they
both
got
up
and
looked
at
each
other
the
last
one
the
rat
said
we
shall
be
on
our
way
back
to
london
number
philibert
place
after
all
the
places
we
been
to
what
will
it
look
like
it
will
be
like
wakening
out
of
a
dream
said
marco
it
not
beautiful
philibert
place
but
will
be
there
and
it
was
as
if
a
light
lighted
itself
in
his
face
and
shone
through
the
very
darkness
of
it
and
the
rat
face
lighted
in
almost
exactly
the
same
way
and
he
pulled
off
his
cap
and
stood
we
obeyed
orders
he
said
we
not
forgotten
one
no
one
has
noticed
us
no
one
has
thought
of
us
we
blown
through
the
countries
as
if
we
had
been
grains
of
dust
marco
head
was
bared
too
and
his
face
was
still
shining
god
be
thanked
he
said
let
us
begin
to
climb
they
pushed
their
way
through
the
ferns
and
wandered
in
and
out
through
trees
until
they
found
the
little
path
the
hill
was
thickly
clothed
with
forest
and
the
little
path
was
sometimes
dark
and
steep
but
they
knew
that
if
they
followed
it
they
would
at
last
come
out
to
a
place
where
there
were
scarcely
any
trees
at
all
and
on
a
crag
they
would
find
the
tiny
church
waiting
for
them
the
priest
might
not
be
there
they
might
have
to
wait
for
him
but
he
would
be
sure
to
come
back
for
morning
mass
and
for
vespers
wheresoever
he
wandered
between
times
there
were
many
stars
in
the
sky
when
at
last
a
turn
of
the
path
showed
them
the
church
above
them
it
was
little
and
built
of
rough
stone
it
looked
as
if
the
priest
himself
and
his
scattered
flock
might
have
broken
and
carried
or
rolled
bits
of
the
hill
to
put
it
together
it
had
the
small
round
summit
the
turks
had
brought
into
europe
in
centuries
past
it
was
so
tiny
that
it
would
hold
but
a
very
small
congregation
and
close
to
it
was
a
house
which
was
of
course
the
priest
the
two
boys
stopped
on
the
path
to
look
at
it
there
is
a
candle
burning
in
one
of
the
little
windows
said
marco
there
is
a
well
near
the
door
and
some
one
is
beginning
to
draw
water
said
the
rat
next
it
is
too
dark
to
see
who
it
is
listen
they
listened
and
heard
the
bucket
descend
on
the
chains
and
splash
in
the
water
then
it
was
drawn
up
and
it
seemed
some
one
drank
long
then
they
saw
a
dim
figure
move
forward
and
stand
still
then
they
heard
a
voice
begin
to
pray
aloud
as
if
the
owner
being
accustomed
to
utter
solitude
did
not
think
of
earthly
hearers
come
marco
said
and
they
went
forward
because
the
stars
were
so
many
and
the
air
so
clear
the
priest
heard
their
feet
on
the
path
and
saw
them
almost
as
soon
as
he
heard
them
he
ended
his
prayer
and
watched
them
coming
a
lad
on
crutches
who
moved
as
lightly
and
easily
as
a
bird
and
a
lad
who
even
yards
away
was
noticeable
for
a
bearing
of
his
body
which
was
neither
haughty
nor
proud
but
set
him
somehow
aloof
from
every
other
lad
one
had
ever
seen
a
magnificent
lad
though
as
he
drew
near
the
starlight
showed
his
face
thin
and
his
eyes
hollow
as
if
with
fatigue
or
hunger
and
who
is
this
one
the
old
priest
murmured
to
himself
marco
drew
up
before
him
and
made
a
respectful
reverence
then
he
lifted
his
black
head
squared
his
shoulders
and
uttered
his
message
for
the
last
time
the
lamp
is
lighted
father
he
said
the
lamp
is
lighted
the
old
priest
stood
quite
still
and
gazed
into
his
face
the
next
moment
he
bent
his
head
so
that
he
could
look
at
him
closely
it
seemed
almost
as
if
he
were
frightened
and
wanted
to
make
sure
of
something
at
the
moment
it
flashed
through
the
rat
mind
that
the
old
old
woman
on
the
had
looked
frightened
in
something
the
same
way
i
am
an
old
man
he
said
my
eyes
are
not
good
if
i
had
a
light
and
he
glanced
towards
the
house
it
was
the
rat
who
with
one
whirl
swung
through
the
door
and
seized
the
candle
he
guessed
what
he
wanted
he
held
it
himself
so
that
the
flare
fell
on
marco
face
the
old
priest
drew
nearer
and
nearer
he
gasped
for
breath
you
are
the
son
of
stefan
loristan
he
cried
it
is
who
brings
the
sign
he
fell
upon
his
knees
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
both
the
boys
heard
him
sobbing
and
praying
praying
and
sobbing
at
once
they
glanced
at
each
other
the
rat
was
bursting
with
excitement
but
he
felt
a
little
awkward
also
and
wondered
what
marco
would
do
an
old
fellow
on
his
knees
crying
made
a
chap
feel
as
if
he
did
know
what
to
say
must
you
comfort
him
or
must
you
let
him
go
on
marco
only
stood
quite
still
and
looked
at
him
with
understanding
and
gravity
yes
father
he
said
i
am
the
son
of
stefan
loristan
and
i
have
given
the
sign
to
all
you
are
the
last
one
the
lamp
is
lighted
i
could
weep
for
gladness
too
the
priest
tears
and
prayers
ended
he
rose
to
his
feet
a
old
man
with
long
and
thick
white
hair
which
fell
on
his
shoulders
and
smiled
at
marco
while
his
eyes
were
still
wet
you
have
passed
from
one
country
to
another
with
the
message
he
said
you
were
under
orders
to
say
those
four
words
yes
father
answered
marco
that
was
all
you
were
to
say
no
more
i
know
no
more
silence
has
been
the
order
since
i
took
my
oath
of
allegiance
when
i
was
a
child
i
was
not
old
enough
to
fight
or
serve
or
reason
about
great
things
all
i
could
do
was
to
be
silent
and
to
train
myself
to
remember
and
be
ready
when
i
was
called
when
my
father
saw
i
was
ready
he
trusted
me
to
go
out
and
give
the
sign
he
told
me
the
four
words
nothing
else
the
old
man
watched
him
with
a
wondering
face
if
stefan
loristan
does
not
know
best
he
said
who
does
he
always
knows
answered
marco
proudly
always
he
waved
his
hand
like
a
young
king
toward
the
rat
he
wanted
each
man
they
met
to
understand
the
value
of
the
rat
he
chose
for
me
this
companion
he
added
i
have
done
nothing
alone
he
let
me
call
myself
his
burst
forth
the
rat
i
would
be
cut
into
strips
for
him
marco
translated
then
the
priest
looked
at
the
rat
and
slowly
nodded
his
head
yes
he
said
he
knew
best
he
always
knows
best
that
i
see
how
did
you
know
i
was
my
father
son
asked
marco
you
have
seen
him
no
was
the
answer
but
i
have
seen
a
picture
which
is
said
to
be
his
image
and
you
are
the
picture
self
it
is
indeed
a
strange
thing
that
two
of
god
creatures
should
be
so
alike
there
is
a
purpose
in
it
he
led
them
into
his
bare
small
house
and
made
them
rest
and
drink
goat
milk
and
eat
food
as
he
moved
about
the
place
there
was
a
mysterious
and
exalted
look
on
his
face
you
must
be
refreshed
before
we
leave
here
he
said
at
last
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
a
place
hidden
in
the
mountains
where
there
are
men
whose
hearts
will
leap
at
the
sight
of
you
to
see
you
will
give
them
new
power
and
courage
and
new
resolve
they
meet
as
they
or
their
ancestors
have
met
for
centuries
but
now
they
are
nearing
the
end
of
their
waiting
and
i
shall
bring
them
the
son
of
stefan
loristan
who
is
the
bearer
of
the
sign
they
ate
the
bread
and
cheese
and
drank
the
goat
milk
he
gave
them
but
marco
explained
that
they
did
not
need
rest
as
they
had
slept
all
day
they
were
prepared
to
follow
him
when
he
was
ready
the
last
faint
hint
of
twilight
had
died
into
night
and
the
stars
were
at
their
thickest
when
they
set
out
together
the
old
man
took
a
thick
knotted
staff
in
his
hand
and
led
the
way
he
knew
it
well
though
it
was
a
rugged
and
steep
one
with
no
track
to
mark
it
sometimes
they
seemed
to
be
walking
around
the
mountain
sometimes
they
were
climbing
sometimes
they
dragged
themselves
over
rocks
or
fallen
trees
or
struggled
through
almost
impassable
thickets
more
than
once
they
descended
into
ravines
and
almost
at
the
risk
of
their
lives
clambered
and
drew
themselves
with
the
aid
of
the
undergrowth
up
the
other
side
the
rat
was
called
upon
to
use
all
his
prowess
and
sometimes
marco
and
the
priest
helped
him
across
obstacles
with
the
aid
of
his
crutch
have
i
shown
whether
i
a
cripple
or
not
he
said
once
to
marco
you
can
tell
about
this
ca
you
and
that
the
crutches
helped
instead
of
being
in
the
way
they
had
been
out
nearly
two
hours
when
they
came
to
a
place
where
the
undergrowth
was
thick
and
a
huge
tree
had
fallen
crashing
down
among
it
in
some
storm
not
far
from
the
tree
was
an
outcropping
rock
only
the
top
of
it
was
to
be
seen
above
the
heavy
tangle
they
had
pushed
their
way
through
the
jungle
of
bushes
and
young
saplings
led
by
their
companion
they
did
not
know
where
they
would
be
led
next
and
were
supposed
to
push
forward
further
when
the
priest
stopped
by
the
outcropping
rock
he
stood
silent
a
few
minutes
quite
motionless
as
if
he
were
listening
to
the
forest
and
the
night
but
there
was
utter
stillness
there
was
not
even
a
breeze
to
stir
a
leaf
or
a
bird
to
sleepily
chirp
he
struck
the
rock
with
his
staff
twice
and
then
twice
again
marco
and
the
rat
stood
with
bated
breath
they
did
not
wait
long
presently
each
of
them
found
himself
leaning
forward
staring
with
almost
unbelieving
eyes
not
at
the
priest
or
his
staff
but
at
rock
it
was
moving
yes
it
moved
the
priest
stepped
aside
and
it
slowly
turned
as
if
worked
by
a
lever
as
it
turned
it
gradually
revealed
a
chasm
of
darkness
dimly
lighted
and
the
priest
spoke
to
marco
there
are
like
this
all
through
samavia
he
said
patience
and
misery
have
waited
long
in
them
they
are
the
caverns
of
the
forgers
of
the
sword
come
xxvii
it
is
the
lost
prince
it
is
ivor
many
times
since
their
journey
had
begun
the
boys
had
found
their
hearts
beating
with
the
thrill
and
excitement
of
things
the
story
of
which
their
lives
had
been
a
part
was
a
experience
but
as
they
carefully
made
their
way
down
the
steep
steps
leading
seemingly
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
both
marco
and
the
rat
felt
as
though
the
old
priest
must
hear
the
thudding
in
their
young
sides
forgers
of
the
sword
remember
every
word
they
say
the
rat
whispered
so
that
you
can
tell
it
to
me
afterwards
do
forget
anything
i
wish
i
knew
samavian
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
stood
the
man
who
was
evidently
the
sentinel
who
worked
the
lever
that
turned
the
rock
he
was
a
big
burly
peasant
with
a
good
watchful
face
and
the
priest
gave
him
a
greeting
and
a
blessing
as
he
took
from
him
the
lantern
he
held
out
they
went
through
a
narrow
and
dark
passage
and
down
some
more
steps
and
turned
a
corner
into
another
corridor
cut
out
of
rock
and
earth
it
was
a
wider
corridor
but
still
dark
so
that
marco
and
the
rat
had
walked
some
yards
before
their
eyes
became
sufficiently
accustomed
to
the
dim
light
to
see
that
the
walls
themselves
seemed
made
of
arms
stacked
closely
together
the
forgers
of
the
sword
the
rat
was
unconsciously
mumbling
to
himself
the
forgers
of
the
sword
it
must
have
taken
years
to
cut
out
the
rounding
passage
they
threaded
their
way
through
and
longer
years
to
forge
the
solid
bristling
walls
but
the
rat
remembered
the
story
the
stranger
had
told
his
drunken
father
of
the
few
mountain
herdsmen
who
in
their
savage
grief
and
wrath
over
the
loss
of
their
prince
had
banded
themselves
together
with
a
solemn
oath
which
had
been
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
the
samavians
were
a
people
and
the
fact
that
their
passion
must
be
smothered
had
made
it
burn
all
the
more
fiercely
five
hundred
years
ago
they
had
first
sworn
their
oath
and
kings
had
come
and
gone
had
died
or
been
murdered
and
dynasties
had
changed
but
the
forgers
of
the
sword
had
not
changed
or
forgotten
their
oath
or
wavered
in
their
belief
that
some
time
some
time
even
after
the
long
dark
years
the
soul
of
their
lost
prince
would
be
among
them
once
more
and
that
they
would
kneel
at
the
feet
and
kiss
the
hands
of
him
for
whose
body
that
soul
had
been
reborn
and
for
the
last
hundred
years
their
number
and
power
and
their
hiding
places
had
so
increased
that
samavia
was
at
last
honeycombed
with
them
and
they
only
waited
breathless
for
the
lighting
of
the
lamp
the
old
priest
knew
how
breathlessly
and
he
knew
what
he
was
bringing
them
marco
and
the
rat
in
spite
of
their
fond
were
not
quite
old
enough
to
know
how
fierce
and
full
of
flaming
eagerness
the
breathless
waiting
of
savage
men
could
be
but
there
was
a
thrill
in
knowing
that
they
who
were
being
led
to
them
were
the
bearers
of
the
sign
the
rat
went
hot
and
cold
he
gnawed
his
fingers
as
he
went
he
could
almost
have
shrieked
aloud
in
the
intensity
of
his
excitement
when
the
old
priest
stopped
before
a
big
black
door
marco
made
no
sound
excitement
or
danger
always
made
him
look
tall
and
quite
pale
he
looked
both
now
the
priest
touched
the
door
and
it
opened
they
were
looking
into
an
immense
cavern
its
walls
and
roof
were
lined
with
arms
guns
swords
bayonets
javelins
daggers
pistols
every
weapon
a
desperate
man
might
use
the
place
was
full
of
men
who
turned
towards
the
door
when
it
opened
they
all
made
obeisance
to
the
priest
but
marco
realized
almost
at
the
same
instant
that
they
started
on
seeing
that
he
was
not
alone
they
were
a
strange
and
picturesque
crowd
as
they
stood
under
their
canopy
of
weapons
in
the
lurid
torchlight
marco
saw
at
once
that
they
were
men
of
all
classes
though
all
were
alike
roughly
dressed
they
were
huge
mountaineers
and
plainsmen
young
and
mature
in
years
some
of
the
biggest
were
men
with
white
hair
but
with
bodies
of
giants
and
with
determination
in
their
strong
jaws
there
were
many
of
these
marco
saw
and
in
each
man
eyes
whether
he
were
young
or
old
glowed
a
steady
unconquered
flame
they
had
been
beaten
so
often
they
had
been
oppressed
and
robbed
but
in
the
eyes
of
each
one
was
this
unconquered
flame
which
throughout
all
the
long
tragedy
of
years
had
been
handed
down
from
father
to
son
it
was
this
which
had
gone
on
through
centuries
keeping
its
oath
and
forging
its
swords
in
the
caverns
of
the
earth
and
which
was
waiting
the
old
priest
laid
his
hand
on
marco
shoulder
and
gently
pushed
him
before
him
through
the
crowd
which
parted
to
make
way
for
them
he
did
not
stop
until
the
two
stood
in
the
very
midst
of
the
circle
which
fell
back
gazing
wonderingly
marco
looked
up
at
the
old
man
because
for
several
seconds
he
did
not
speak
it
was
plain
that
he
did
not
speak
because
he
also
was
excited
and
could
not
he
opened
his
lips
and
his
voice
seemed
to
fail
him
then
he
tried
again
and
spoke
so
that
all
could
hear
even
the
men
at
the
back
of
the
gazing
circle
my
children
he
said
this
is
the
son
of
stefan
loristan
and
he
comes
to
bear
the
sign
my
son
to
marco
speak
then
marco
understood
what
he
wished
and
also
what
he
felt
he
felt
it
himself
that
magnificent
uplifting
gladness
as
he
spoke
holding
his
black
head
high
and
lifting
his
right
hand
the
lamp
is
lighted
brothers
he
cried
the
lamp
is
lighted
then
the
rat
who
stood
apart
watching
thought
that
the
strange
world
within
the
cavern
had
gone
mad
wild
smothered
cries
broke
forth
men
caught
each
other
in
passionate
embrace
they
fell
upon
their
knees
they
clutched
one
another
sobbing
they
wrung
each
other
hands
they
leaped
into
the
air
it
was
as
if
they
could
not
bear
the
joy
of
hearing
that
the
end
of
their
waiting
had
come
at
last
they
rushed
upon
marco
and
fell
at
his
feet
the
rat
saw
big
peasants
kissing
his
shoes
his
hands
every
scrap
of
his
clothing
they
could
seize
the
wild
circle
swayed
and
closed
upon
him
until
the
rat
was
afraid
he
did
not
know
that
overpowered
by
this
frenzy
of
emotion
his
own
excitement
was
making
him
shake
from
head
to
foot
like
a
leaf
and
that
tears
were
streaming
down
his
cheeks
the
swaying
crowd
hid
marco
from
him
and
he
began
to
fight
his
way
towards
him
because
his
excitement
increased
with
fear
the
crowd
of
men
seemed
for
the
moment
to
have
almost
ceased
to
be
sane
marco
was
only
a
boy
they
did
not
know
how
fiercely
they
were
pressing
upon
him
and
keeping
away
the
very
air
do
kill
him
do
kill
him
yelled
the
rat
struggling
forward
stand
back
you
fools
i
his
let
me
pass
and
though
no
one
understood
his
english
one
or
two
suddenly
remembered
they
had
seen
him
enter
with
the
priest
and
so
gave
way
but
just
then
the
old
priest
lifted
his
hand
above
the
crowd
and
spoke
in
a
voice
of
stern
command
stand
back
my
children
he
cried
madness
is
not
the
homage
you
must
bring
to
the
son
of
stefan
loristan
obey
obey
his
voice
had
a
power
in
it
that
penetrated
even
the
wildest
herdsmen
the
frenzied
mass
swayed
back
and
left
space
about
marco
whose
face
the
rat
could
at
last
see
it
was
very
white
with
emotion
and
in
his
eyes
there
was
a
look
which
was
like
awe
the
rat
pushed
forward
until
he
stood
beside
him
he
did
not
know
that
he
almost
sobbed
as
he
spoke
i
your
he
said
i
going
to
stand
here
your
father
sent
me
i
under
orders
i
thought
they
crush
you
to
death
he
glared
at
the
circle
about
them
as
if
instead
of
worshippers
distraught
with
adoration
they
had
been
enemies
the
old
priest
seeing
him
touched
marco
arm
tell
him
he
need
not
fear
he
said
it
was
only
for
the
first
few
moments
the
passion
of
their
souls
drove
them
wild
they
are
your
slaves
those
at
the
back
might
have
pushed
the
front
ones
on
until
they
trampled
you
under
foot
in
spite
of
themselves
the
rat
persisted
no
said
marco
they
would
have
stopped
if
i
had
spoken
why
did
you
speak
then
snapped
the
rat
all
they
felt
was
for
samavia
and
for
my
father
marco
said
and
for
the
sign
i
felt
as
they
did
the
rat
was
somewhat
softened
it
was
true
after
all
how
could
he
have
tried
to
quell
the
outbursts
of
their
worship
of
loristan
of
the
country
he
was
saving
for
them
of
the
sign
which
called
them
to
freedom
he
could
not
then
followed
a
strange
and
picturesque
ceremonial
the
priest
went
about
among
the
encircling
crowd
and
spoke
to
one
man
after
another
sometimes
to
a
group
a
larger
circle
was
formed
as
the
pale
old
man
moved
about
the
rat
felt
as
if
some
religious
ceremony
were
going
to
be
performed
watching
it
from
first
to
last
he
was
thrilled
to
the
core
at
the
end
of
the
cavern
a
block
of
stone
had
been
cut
out
to
look
like
an
altar
it
was
covered
with
white
and
against
the
wall
above
it
hung
a
large
picture
veiled
by
a
curtain
from
the
roof
there
swung
before
it
an
ancient
lamp
of
metal
suspended
by
chains
in
front
of
the
altar
was
a
sort
of
stone
dais
there
the
priest
asked
marco
to
stand
with
his
on
the
lower
level
in
attendance
a
knot
of
the
biggest
herdsmen
went
out
and
returned
each
carried
a
huge
sword
which
had
perhaps
been
of
the
earliest
made
in
the
dark
days
gone
by
the
bearers
formed
themselves
into
a
line
on
either
side
of
marco
they
raised
their
swords
and
formed
a
pointed
arch
above
his
head
and
a
passage
twelve
men
long
when
the
points
first
clashed
together
the
rat
struck
himself
hard
upon
his
breast
his
exultation
was
too
keen
to
endure
he
gazed
at
marco
standing
still
in
that
curiously
splendid
way
in
which
both
he
and
his
father
stand
still
and
wondered
how
he
could
do
it
he
looked
as
if
he
were
prepared
for
any
strange
thing
which
could
happen
to
him
because
he
was
under
orders
the
rat
knew
that
he
was
doing
whatsoever
he
did
merely
for
his
father
sake
it
was
as
if
he
felt
that
he
was
representing
his
father
though
he
was
a
mere
boy
and
that
because
of
this
boy
as
he
was
he
must
bear
himself
nobly
and
remain
outwardly
undisturbed
at
the
end
of
the
arch
of
swords
the
old
priest
stood
and
gave
a
sign
to
one
man
after
another
when
the
sign
was
given
to
a
man
he
walked
under
the
arch
to
the
dais
and
there
knelt
and
lifting
marco
hand
to
his
lips
kissed
it
with
passionate
fervor
then
he
returned
to
the
place
he
had
left
one
after
another
passed
up
the
aisle
of
swords
one
after
another
knelt
one
after
the
other
kissed
the
brown
young
hand
rose
and
went
away
sometimes
the
rat
heard
a
few
words
which
sounded
almost
like
a
murmured
prayer
sometimes
he
heard
a
sob
as
a
shaggy
head
bent
again
and
again
he
saw
eyes
wet
with
tears
once
or
twice
marco
spoke
a
few
samavian
words
and
the
face
of
the
man
spoken
to
flamed
with
joy
the
rat
had
time
to
see
as
marco
had
seen
that
many
of
the
faces
were
not
those
of
peasants
some
of
them
were
clear
cut
and
subtle
and
of
the
type
of
scholars
or
nobles
it
took
a
long
time
for
them
all
to
kneel
and
kiss
the
lad
hand
but
no
man
omitted
the
ceremony
and
when
at
last
it
was
at
an
end
a
strange
silence
filled
the
cavern
they
stood
and
gazed
at
each
other
with
burning
eyes
the
priest
moved
to
marco
side
and
stood
near
the
altar
he
leaned
forward
and
took
in
his
hand
a
cord
which
hung
from
the
veiled
picture
he
drew
it
and
the
curtain
fell
apart
there
seemed
to
stand
gazing
at
them
from
between
its
folds
a
tall
kingly
youth
with
deep
eyes
in
which
the
stars
of
god
were
stilly
shining
and
with
a
smile
wonderful
to
behold
around
the
heavy
locks
of
his
black
hair
the
long
dead
painter
of
missals
had
set
a
faint
glow
of
light
like
a
halo
son
of
stefan
loristan
the
old
priest
said
in
a
shaken
voice
it
is
the
lost
prince
it
is
ivor
then
every
man
in
the
room
fell
on
his
knees
even
the
men
who
had
upheld
the
archway
of
swords
dropped
their
weapons
with
a
crash
and
knelt
also
he
was
their
saint
this
boy
dead
for
five
hundred
years
he
was
their
saint
still
ivor
ivor
the
voices
broke
into
a
heavy
murmur
ivor
ivor
as
if
they
chanted
a
litany
marco
started
forward
staring
at
the
picture
his
breath
caught
in
his
throat
his
lips
apart
but
but
he
stammered
but
if
my
father
were
as
young
as
he
is
he
would
be
him
when
you
are
as
old
as
he
is
will
be
like
him
said
the
priest
and
he
let
the
curtain
fall
the
rat
stood
staring
with
wide
eyes
from
marco
to
the
picture
and
from
the
picture
to
marco
and
he
breathed
faster
and
faster
and
gnawed
his
finger
ends
but
he
did
not
utter
a
word
he
could
not
have
done
it
if
he
tried
then
marco
stepped
down
from
the
dais
as
if
he
were
in
a
dream
and
the
old
man
followed
him
the
men
with
swords
sprang
to
their
feet
and
made
their
archway
again
with
a
new
clash
of
steel
the
old
man
and
the
boy
passed
under
it
together
now
every
man
eyes
were
fixed
on
marco
at
the
heavy
door
by
which
he
had
entered
he
stopped
and
turned
to
meet
their
glances
he
looked
very
young
and
thin
and
pale
but
suddenly
his
father
smile
was
lighted
in
his
face
he
said
a
few
words
in
samavian
clearly
and
gravely
saluted
and
passed
out
what
did
you
say
to
them
gasped
the
rat
stumbling
after
him
as
the
door
closed
behind
them
and
shut
in
the
murmur
of
impassioned
sound
there
was
only
one
thing
to
say
was
the
answer
they
are
men
i
am
only
a
boy
i
thanked
them
for
my
father
and
told
them
he
would
never
never
forget
xxviii
extra
extra
extra
it
was
raining
in
london
pouring
it
had
been
raining
for
two
weeks
more
or
less
generally
more
when
the
train
from
dover
drew
in
at
charing
cross
the
weather
seemed
suddenly
to
have
considered
that
it
had
so
far
been
too
lenient
and
must
express
itself
much
more
vigorously
so
it
had
gathered
together
its
resources
and
poured
them
forth
in
a
deluge
which
surprised
even
londoners
the
rain
so
beat
against
and
streamed
down
the
windows
of
the
carriage
in
which
marco
and
the
rat
sat
that
they
could
not
see
through
them
they
had
made
their
homeward
journey
much
more
rapidly
than
they
had
made
the
one
on
which
they
had
been
outward
bound
it
had
of
course
taken
them
some
time
to
tramp
back
to
the
frontier
but
there
had
been
no
reason
for
stopping
anywhere
after
they
had
once
reached
the
railroads
they
had
been
tired
sometimes
but
they
had
slept
heavily
on
the
wooden
seats
of
the
railway
carriages
their
one
desire
was
to
get
home
no
philibert
place
rose
before
them
in
its
noisy
dinginess
as
the
one
desirable
spot
on
earth
to
marco
it
held
his
father
and
it
was
loristan
alone
that
the
rat
saw
when
he
thought
of
it
loristan
as
he
would
look
when
he
saw
him
come
into
the
room
with
marco
and
stand
up
and
salute
and
say
i
have
brought
him
back
sir
he
has
carried
out
every
single
order
you
gave
him
every
single
one
so
have
i
so
he
had
he
had
been
sent
as
his
companion
and
attendant
and
he
had
been
faithful
in
every
thought
if
marco
would
have
allowed
him
he
would
have
waited
upon
him
like
a
servant
and
have
been
proud
of
the
service
but
marco
would
never
let
him
forget
that
they
were
only
two
boys
and
that
one
was
of
no
more
importance
than
the
other
he
had
secretly
even
felt
this
attitude
to
be
a
sort
of
grievance
it
would
have
been
more
like
a
game
if
one
of
them
had
been
the
mere
servitor
of
the
other
and
if
that
other
had
blustered
a
little
and
issued
commands
and
demanded
sacrifices
if
the
faithful
vassal
could
have
been
wounded
or
cast
into
a
dungeon
for
his
young
commander
sake
the
adventure
would
have
been
more
complete
but
though
their
journey
had
been
full
of
wonders
and
rich
with
beauties
though
the
memory
of
it
hung
in
the
rat
mind
like
a
background
of
tapestry
embroidered
in
all
the
hues
of
the
earth
with
all
the
splendors
of
it
there
had
been
no
dungeons
and
no
wounds
after
the
adventure
in
munich
their
unimportant
boyishness
had
not
even
been
observed
by
such
perils
as
might
have
threatened
them
as
the
rat
had
said
they
had
blown
like
grains
of
dust
through
europe
and
had
been
as
nothing
and
this
was
what
loristan
had
planned
this
was
what
his
grave
thought
had
wrought
out
if
they
had
been
men
they
would
not
have
been
so
safe
from
the
time
they
had
left
the
old
priest
on
the
hillside
to
begin
their
journey
back
to
the
frontier
they
both
had
been
given
to
long
silences
as
they
tramped
side
by
side
or
lay
on
the
moss
in
the
forests
now
that
their
work
was
done
a
sort
of
reaction
had
set
in
there
were
no
more
plans
to
be
made
and
no
more
uncertainties
to
contemplate
they
were
on
their
way
back
to
no
philibert
place
marco
to
his
father
the
rat
to
the
man
he
worshipped
each
of
them
was
thinking
of
many
things
marco
was
full
of
longing
to
see
his
father
face
and
hear
his
voice
again
he
wanted
to
feel
the
pressure
of
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
to
be
sure
that
he
was
real
and
not
a
dream
this
last
was
because
during
this
homeward
journey
everything
that
had
happened
often
seemed
to
be
a
dream
it
had
all
been
so
wonderful
the
climber
standing
looking
down
at
them
the
morning
they
awakened
on
the
gaisburg
the
mountaineer
shoemaker
measuring
his
foot
in
the
small
shop
the
old
old
woman
and
her
noble
lord
the
prince
with
his
face
turned
upward
as
he
stood
on
the
balcony
looking
at
the
moon
the
old
priest
kneeling
and
weeping
for
joy
the
great
cavern
with
the
yellow
light
upon
the
crowd
of
passionate
faces
the
curtain
which
fell
apart
and
showed
the
still
eyes
and
the
black
hair
with
the
halo
about
it
now
that
they
were
left
behind
they
all
seemed
like
things
he
had
dreamed
but
he
had
not
dreamed
them
he
was
going
back
to
tell
his
father
about
them
and
how
it
would
be
to
feel
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
the
rat
gnawed
his
finger
ends
a
great
deal
his
thoughts
were
more
wild
and
feverish
than
marco
they
leaped
forward
in
spite
of
him
it
was
no
use
to
pull
himself
up
and
tell
himself
that
he
was
a
fool
now
that
all
was
over
he
had
time
to
be
as
great
a
fool
as
he
was
inclined
to
be
but
how
he
longed
to
reach
london
and
stand
face
to
face
with
loristan
the
sign
was
given
the
lamp
was
lighted
what
would
happen
next
his
crutches
were
under
his
arms
before
the
train
drew
up
we
there
we
there
he
cried
restlessly
to
marco
they
had
no
luggage
to
delay
them
they
took
their
bags
and
followed
the
crowd
along
the
platform
the
rain
was
rattling
like
bullets
against
the
high
glassed
roof
people
turned
to
look
at
marco
seeing
the
glow
of
exultant
eagerness
in
his
face
they
thought
he
must
be
some
boy
coming
home
for
the
holidays
and
going
to
make
a
visit
at
a
place
he
delighted
in
the
rain
was
dancing
on
the
pavements
when
they
reached
the
entrance
a
cab
wo
cost
much
marco
said
and
it
will
take
us
quickly
they
called
one
and
got
into
it
each
of
them
had
flushed
cheeks
and
marco
eyes
looked
as
if
he
were
gazing
at
something
a
long
way
off
gazing
at
it
and
wondering
we
come
back
said
the
rat
in
an
unsteady
voice
we
been
and
we
come
back
then
suddenly
turning
to
look
at
marco
does
it
ever
seem
to
you
as
if
perhaps
it
it
was
true
yes
marco
answered
but
it
was
true
and
it
done
then
he
added
after
a
second
or
so
of
silence
just
what
the
rat
had
said
to
himself
what
next
he
said
it
very
low
the
way
to
philibert
place
was
not
long
when
they
turned
into
the
roaring
untidy
road
where
the
busses
and
drays
and
carts
struggled
past
each
other
with
their
loads
and
the
people
hurried
in
crowds
along
the
pavement
they
looked
at
them
all
feeling
that
they
had
left
their
dream
far
behind
indeed
but
they
were
at
home
it
was
a
good
thing
to
see
lazarus
open
the
door
and
stand
waiting
before
they
had
time
to
get
out
of
the
cab
cabs
stopped
so
seldom
before
houses
in
philibert
place
that
the
inmates
were
always
prompt
to
open
their
doors
when
lazarus
had
seen
this
one
stop
at
the
broken
iron
gate
he
had
known
whom
it
brought
he
had
kept
an
eye
on
the
windows
faithfully
for
many
a
day
even
when
he
knew
that
it
was
too
soon
even
if
all
was
well
for
any
travelers
to
return
he
bore
himself
with
an
air
more
than
usually
military
and
his
salute
when
marco
crossed
the
threshold
was
formal
stateliness
itself
but
his
greeting
burst
from
his
heart
god
be
thanked
he
said
in
his
deep
growl
of
joy
god
be
thanked
when
marco
put
forth
his
hand
he
bent
his
grizzled
head
and
kissed
it
devoutly
god
be
thanked
he
said
again
my
father
marco
began
my
father
is
out
if
he
had
been
in
the
house
he
knew
he
would
not
have
stayed
in
the
back
sir
said
lazarus
will
you
come
with
me
into
his
room
you
too
sir
to
the
rat
he
had
never
said
sir
to
him
before
he
opened
the
door
of
the
familiar
room
and
the
boys
entered
the
room
was
empty
marco
did
not
speak
neither
did
the
rat
they
both
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
shabby
carpet
and
looked
up
at
the
old
soldier
both
had
suddenly
the
same
feeling
that
the
earth
had
dropped
from
beneath
their
feet
lazarus
saw
it
and
spoke
fast
and
with
tremor
he
was
almost
as
agitated
as
they
were
he
left
me
at
your
service
at
your
command
he
began
left
you
said
marco
he
left
us
all
three
under
orders
to
said
lazarus
the
master
has
gone
the
rat
felt
something
hot
rush
into
his
eyes
he
brushed
it
away
that
he
might
look
at
marco
face
the
shock
had
changed
it
very
much
its
glowing
eager
joy
had
died
out
it
had
turned
paler
and
his
brows
were
drawn
together
for
a
few
seconds
he
did
not
speak
at
all
and
when
he
did
speak
the
rat
knew
that
his
voice
was
steady
only
because
he
willed
that
it
should
be
so
if
he
has
gone
he
said
it
is
because
he
had
a
strong
reason
it
was
because
he
also
was
under
orders
he
said
that
you
would
know
that
lazarus
answered
he
was
called
in
such
haste
that
he
had
not
a
moment
in
which
to
do
more
than
write
a
few
words
he
left
them
for
you
on
his
desk
there
marco
walked
over
to
the
desk
and
opened
the
envelope
which
was
lying
there
there
were
only
a
few
lines
on
the
sheet
of
paper
inside
and
they
had
evidently
been
written
in
the
greatest
haste
they
were
these
the
life
of
my
life
for
samavia
he
was
called
to
samavia
marco
said
and
the
thought
sent
his
blood
rushing
through
his
veins
he
has
gone
to
samavia
lazarus
drew
his
hand
roughly
across
his
eyes
and
his
voice
shook
and
sounded
hoarse
there
has
been
great
disaffection
in
the
camps
of
the
maranovitch
he
said
the
remnant
of
the
army
has
gone
mad
sir
silence
is
still
the
order
but
who
knows
who
knows
god
alone
he
had
not
finished
speaking
before
he
turned
his
head
as
if
listening
to
sounds
in
the
road
they
were
the
kind
of
sounds
which
had
broken
up
the
squad
and
sent
it
rushing
down
the
passage
into
the
street
to
seize
on
a
newspaper
there
was
to
be
heard
a
commotion
of
newsboys
shouting
riotously
some
startling
piece
of
news
which
had
called
out
an
extra
the
rat
heard
it
first
and
dashed
to
the
front
door
as
he
opened
it
a
newsboy
running
by
shouted
at
the
topmost
power
of
his
lungs
the
news
he
had
to
sell
assassination
of
king
michael
maranovitch
by
his
own
soldiers
assassination
of
the
maranovitch
extra
extra
extra
when
the
rat
returned
with
a
newspaper
lazarus
interposed
between
him
and
marco
with
great
and
respectful
ceremony
sir
he
said
to
marco
i
am
at
your
command
but
the
master
left
me
with
an
order
which
i
was
to
repeat
to
you
he
requested
you
to
read
the
newspapers
until
he
himself
could
see
you
again
both
boys
fell
back
not
read
the
papers
they
exclaimed
together
lazarus
had
never
before
been
quite
so
reverential
and
ceremonious
your
pardon
sir
he
said
i
may
read
them
at
your
orders
and
report
such
things
as
it
is
well
that
you
should
know
there
have
been
dark
tales
told
and
there
may
be
darker
ones
he
asked
that
you
would
not
read
for
yourself
if
you
meet
again
when
you
meet
again
he
corrected
himself
hastily
when
you
meet
again
he
says
you
will
understand
i
am
your
servant
i
will
read
and
answer
all
such
questions
as
i
can
the
rat
handed
him
the
paper
and
they
returned
to
the
back
room
together
you
shall
tell
us
what
he
would
wish
us
to
hear
marco
said
the
news
was
soon
told
the
story
was
not
a
long
one
as
exact
details
had
not
yet
reached
london
it
was
briefly
that
the
head
of
the
maranovitch
party
had
been
put
to
death
by
infuriated
soldiers
of
his
own
army
it
was
an
army
drawn
chiefly
from
a
peasantry
which
did
not
love
its
leaders
or
wish
to
fight
and
suffering
and
brutal
treatment
had
at
last
roused
it
to
furious
revolt
what
next
said
marco
if
i
were
a
samavian
began
the
rat
and
then
he
stopped
lazarus
stood
biting
his
lips
but
staring
stonily
at
the
carpet
not
the
rat
alone
but
marco
also
noted
a
grim
change
in
him
it
was
grim
because
it
suggested
that
he
was
holding
himself
under
an
iron
control
it
was
as
if
while
tortured
by
anxiety
he
had
sworn
not
to
allow
himself
to
look
anxious
and
the
resolve
set
his
jaw
hard
and
carved
new
lines
in
his
rugged
face
each
boy
thought
this
in
secret
but
did
not
wish
to
put
it
into
words
if
he
was
anxious
he
could
only
be
so
for
one
reason
and
each
realized
what
the
reason
must
be
loristan
had
gone
to
samavia
to
the
torn
and
bleeding
country
filled
with
riot
and
danger
if
he
had
gone
it
could
only
have
been
because
its
danger
called
him
and
he
went
to
face
it
at
its
worst
lazarus
had
been
left
behind
to
watch
over
them
silence
was
still
the
order
and
what
he
knew
he
could
not
tell
them
and
perhaps
he
knew
little
more
than
that
a
great
life
might
be
lost
because
his
master
was
absent
the
old
soldier
seemed
to
feel
that
he
must
comfort
himself
with
a
greater
ceremonial
reverance
than
he
had
ever
shown
before
he
held
himself
within
call
and
at
marco
orders
as
it
had
been
his
custom
to
hold
himself
with
regard
to
loristan
the
ceremonious
service
even
extended
itself
to
the
rat
who
appeared
to
have
taken
a
new
place
in
his
mind
he
also
seemed
now
to
be
a
person
to
be
waited
upon
and
replied
to
with
dignity
and
formal
respect
when
the
evening
meal
was
served
lazarus
drew
out
loristan
chair
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
stood
behind
it
with
a
majestic
air
sir
he
said
to
marco
the
master
requested
that
you
take
his
seat
at
the
table
until
while
he
is
not
with
you
marco
took
the
seat
in
silence
at
two
in
the
morning
when
the
roaring
road
was
still
the
light
from
the
street
lamp
shining
into
the
small
bedroom
fell
on
two
pale
boy
faces
the
rat
sat
up
on
his
sofa
bed
in
the
old
way
with
his
hands
clasped
round
his
knees
marco
lay
flat
on
his
hard
pillow
neither
of
them
had
been
to
sleep
and
yet
they
had
not
talked
a
great
deal
each
had
secretly
guessed
a
good
deal
of
what
the
other
did
not
say
there
is
one
thing
we
must
remember
marco
had
said
early
in
the
night
we
must
not
be
afraid
no
answered
the
rat
almost
fiercely
we
must
not
be
afraid
we
are
tired
we
came
back
expecting
to
be
able
to
tell
it
all
to
him
we
have
always
been
looking
forward
to
that
we
never
thought
once
that
he
might
be
gone
and
he
gone
did
you
feel
as
if
he
turned
towards
the
sofa
as
if
something
had
struck
you
on
the
chest
yes
the
rat
answered
heavily
yes
we
were
ready
said
marco
he
had
never
gone
before
but
we
ought
to
have
known
he
might
some
day
be
called
he
went
because
he
was
called
he
told
us
to
wait
we
do
know
what
we
are
waiting
for
but
we
know
that
we
must
not
be
afraid
to
let
ourselves
be
would
be
breaking
the
law
the
law
groaned
the
rat
dropping
his
head
on
his
hands
forgotten
about
it
let
us
remember
it
said
marco
this
is
the
time
not
not
he
repeated
the
last
words
again
and
again
fear
not
fear
not
he
said
can
harm
him
the
rat
lifted
his
head
and
looked
at
the
bed
sideways
did
you
think
he
said
slowly
did
you
think
that
perhaps
knew
where
the
descendant
of
the
lost
prince
was
marco
answered
even
more
slowly
if
any
one
knew
surely
he
might
he
has
known
so
much
he
said
listen
to
this
broke
forth
the
rat
i
believe
he
has
gone
to
the
people
if
he
does
if
he
could
show
them
all
the
country
would
run
mad
with
joy
it
would
be
only
the
secret
party
all
samavia
would
rise
and
follow
any
flag
he
chose
to
raise
they
prayed
for
the
lost
prince
for
five
hundred
years
and
if
they
believed
they
got
him
once
more
they
fight
like
madmen
for
him
but
there
would
not
be
any
one
to
fight
they
want
the
same
thing
if
they
could
see
the
man
with
ivor
blood
in
his
veins
they
feel
he
had
come
back
to
them
risen
from
the
dead
they
believe
it
he
beat
his
fists
together
in
his
frenzy
of
excitement
it
the
time
it
the
time
he
cried
no
man
could
let
such
a
chance
go
by
he
tell
them
he
that
be
what
he
gone
for
he
knows
he
knows
he
always
known
and
he
threw
himself
back
on
his
sofa
and
flung
his
arms
over
his
face
lying
there
panting
if
it
is
the
time
said
marco
in
a
low
strained
voice
if
it
is
and
he
knows
he
will
tell
them
and
he
threw
his
arms
up
over
his
own
face
and
lay
quite
still
neither
of
them
said
another
word
and
the
street
lamp
shone
in
on
them
as
if
it
were
waiting
for
something
to
happen
but
nothing
happened
in
time
they
were
asleep
xxix
night
and
morning
after
this
they
waited
they
did
not
know
what
they
waited
for
nor
could
they
guess
even
vaguely
how
the
waiting
would
end
all
that
lazarus
could
tell
them
he
told
he
would
have
been
willing
to
stand
respectfully
for
hours
relating
to
marco
the
story
of
how
the
period
of
their
absence
had
passed
for
his
master
and
himself
he
told
how
loristan
had
spoken
each
day
of
his
son
how
he
had
often
been
pale
with
anxiousness
how
in
the
evenings
he
had
walked
to
and
fro
in
his
room
deep
in
thought
as
he
looked
down
unseeingly
at
the
carpet
he
permitted
me
to
talk
of
you
sir
lazarus
said
i
saw
that
he
wished
to
hear
your
name
often
i
reminded
him
of
the
times
when
you
had
been
so
young
that
most
children
of
your
age
would
have
been
in
the
hands
of
nurses
and
yet
you
were
strong
and
silent
and
sturdy
and
traveled
with
us
as
if
you
were
not
a
child
at
all
never
crying
when
you
were
tired
and
were
not
properly
fed
as
if
you
understood
as
if
you
understood
he
added
proudly
if
through
the
power
of
god
a
creature
can
be
a
man
at
six
years
old
you
were
that
one
many
a
dark
day
i
have
looked
into
your
solemn
watching
eyes
and
have
been
half
afraid
because
that
a
child
should
answer
one
gaze
so
gravely
seemed
almost
an
unearthly
thing
the
chief
thing
i
remember
of
those
days
said
marco
is
that
he
was
with
me
and
that
whenever
i
was
hungry
or
tired
i
knew
he
must
be
too
the
feeling
that
they
were
waiting
was
so
intense
that
it
filled
the
days
with
strangeness
when
the
postman
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
each
of
them
endeavored
not
to
start
a
letter
might
some
day
come
which
would
tell
them
they
did
not
know
what
but
no
letters
came
when
they
went
out
into
the
streets
they
found
themselves
hurrying
on
their
way
back
in
spite
of
themselves
something
might
have
happened
lazarus
read
the
papers
faithfully
and
in
the
evening
told
marco
and
the
rat
all
the
news
it
was
well
that
they
should
hear
but
the
disorders
of
samavia
had
ceased
to
occupy
much
space
they
had
become
an
old
story
and
after
the
excitement
of
the
assassination
of
michael
maranovitch
had
died
out
there
seemed
to
be
a
lull
in
events
michael
son
had
not
dared
to
try
to
take
his
father
place
and
there
were
rumors
that
he
also
had
been
killed
the
head
of
the
iarovitch
had
declared
himself
king
but
had
not
been
crowned
because
of
disorders
in
his
own
party
the
country
seemed
existing
in
a
nightmare
of
suffering
famine
and
suspense
samavia
is
too
the
rat
broke
forth
one
night
as
they
talked
together
but
it
wo
wait
long
it
ca
if
i
were
a
samavian
and
in
samavia
my
father
is
a
samavian
and
he
is
in
samavia
marco
grave
young
voice
interposed
the
rat
flushed
red
as
he
realized
what
he
had
said
what
a
fool
i
am
he
groaned
i
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
he
stood
up
when
he
said
the
last
words
and
added
the
sir
as
if
he
suddenly
realized
that
there
was
a
distance
between
them
which
was
something
akin
to
the
distance
between
youth
and
maturity
but
yet
was
not
the
same
you
are
a
good
samavian
but
you
forget
was
marco
answer
lazarus
intense
grimness
increased
with
each
day
that
passed
the
ceremonious
respectfulness
of
his
manner
toward
marco
increased
also
it
seemed
as
if
the
more
anxious
he
felt
the
more
formal
and
stately
his
bearing
became
it
was
as
though
he
braced
his
own
courage
by
doing
the
smallest
things
life
in
the
back
required
as
if
they
were
of
the
dignity
of
services
performed
in
a
much
larger
place
and
under
much
more
imposing
circumstances
the
rat
found
himself
feeling
almost
as
if
he
were
an
equerry
in
a
court
and
that
dignity
and
ceremony
were
necessary
on
his
own
part
he
began
to
experience
a
sense
of
being
somehow
a
person
of
rank
for
whom
doors
were
opened
grandly
and
who
had
vassals
at
his
command
the
watchful
obedience
of
fifty
vassals
embodied
itself
in
the
manner
of
lazarus
i
am
glad
the
rat
said
once
reflectively
that
after
all
my
father
was
once
different
it
makes
it
easier
to
learn
things
perhaps
if
he
had
not
talked
to
me
about
people
who
well
who
had
never
seen
places
like
bone
court
this
might
have
been
harder
for
me
to
understand
when
at
last
they
managed
to
call
the
squad
together
and
went
to
spend
a
morning
at
the
barracks
behind
the
churchyard
that
body
of
armed
men
stared
at
their
commander
in
great
and
amazed
uncertainty
they
felt
that
something
had
happened
to
him
they
did
not
know
what
had
happened
but
it
was
some
experience
which
had
made
him
mysteriously
different
he
did
not
look
like
marco
but
in
some
extraordinary
way
he
seemed
more
akin
to
him
they
only
knew
that
some
necessity
in
loristan
affairs
had
taken
the
two
away
from
london
and
the
game
now
they
had
come
back
and
they
seemed
older
at
first
the
squad
felt
awkward
and
shuffled
its
feet
uncomfortably
after
the
first
greetings
it
did
not
know
exactly
what
to
say
it
was
marco
who
saved
the
situation
drill
us
first
he
said
to
the
rat
then
we
can
talk
about
the
game
shouted
the
rat
magnificently
and
then
they
forgot
everything
else
and
sprang
into
line
after
the
drill
was
ended
and
they
sat
in
a
circle
on
the
broken
flags
the
game
became
more
resplendent
than
it
had
ever
been
i
had
time
to
read
and
work
out
new
things
the
rat
said
reading
is
like
traveling
marco
himself
sat
and
listened
enthralled
by
the
adroitness
of
the
imagination
he
displayed
without
revealing
a
single
dangerous
fact
he
built
up
of
their
journeyings
and
experiences
a
totally
new
structure
of
adventures
which
would
have
fired
the
whole
being
of
any
group
of
lads
it
was
safe
to
describe
places
and
people
and
he
so
described
them
that
the
squad
squirmed
in
its
delight
at
feeling
itself
marching
in
a
procession
attending
the
emperor
in
vienna
standing
in
line
before
palaces
climbing
with
knapsacks
strapped
tight
up
precipitous
mountain
roads
defending
and
storming
samavian
castles
the
squad
glowed
and
exulted
the
rat
glowed
and
exulted
himself
marco
watched
his
face
with
wonder
and
admiration
this
strange
power
of
making
things
alive
was
he
knew
what
his
father
would
call
genius
let
take
the
oath
of
again
shouted
cad
when
the
game
was
over
for
the
morning
the
papers
never
said
nothin
more
about
the
lost
prince
but
we
are
all
for
him
yet
let
take
it
so
they
stood
in
line
again
marco
at
the
head
and
renewed
their
oath
the
sword
in
my
hand
for
samavia
the
heart
in
my
breast
for
samavia
the
swiftness
of
my
sight
the
thought
of
my
brain
the
life
of
my
life
for
samavia
here
grow
twelve
men
for
samavia
god
be
thanked
it
was
more
solemn
than
it
had
been
the
first
time
the
squad
felt
it
tremendously
both
cad
and
ben
were
conscious
that
thrills
ran
down
their
spines
into
their
boots
when
marco
and
the
rat
left
them
they
first
stood
at
salute
and
then
broke
out
into
a
ringing
cheer
on
their
way
home
the
rat
asked
marco
a
question
did
you
see
beedle
standing
at
the
top
of
the
basement
steps
and
looking
after
us
when
we
went
out
this
morning
beedle
was
the
landlady
of
the
lodgings
at
no
philibert
place
she
was
a
mysterious
and
dusty
female
who
lived
in
the
cellar
kitchen
part
of
the
house
and
was
seldom
seen
by
her
lodgers
yes
answered
marco
i
have
seen
her
two
or
three
times
lately
and
i
do
not
think
i
ever
saw
her
before
my
father
has
never
seen
her
though
lazarus
says
she
used
to
watch
him
round
corners
why
is
she
suddenly
so
curious
about
us
i
like
to
know
said
the
rat
i
been
trying
to
work
it
out
ever
since
we
came
back
she
been
peeping
round
the
door
of
the
kitchen
stairs
or
over
balustrades
or
through
the
windows
i
believe
she
wants
to
speak
to
you
and
knows
lazarus
wo
let
her
if
he
catches
her
at
it
when
lazarus
is
about
she
always
darts
back
what
does
she
want
to
say
said
marco
i
like
to
know
said
the
rat
again
when
they
reached
no
philibert
place
they
found
out
because
when
the
door
opened
they
saw
at
the
top
of
stairs
at
the
end
of
the
passage
the
mysterious
beedle
in
her
dusty
black
dress
and
with
a
dusty
black
cap
on
evidently
having
that
minute
mounted
from
her
subterranean
she
had
come
up
the
steps
so
quickly
that
lazarus
had
not
yet
seen
her
young
master
loristan
she
called
out
authoritatively
lazarus
wheeled
about
fiercely
silence
he
commanded
how
dare
you
address
the
young
master
she
snapped
her
fingers
at
him
and
marched
forward
folding
her
arms
tightly
you
mind
your
own
business
she
said
it
young
master
loristan
i
speaking
to
not
his
servant
it
time
he
was
talked
to
about
this
silence
woman
shouted
lazarus
let
her
speak
said
marco
i
want
to
hear
what
is
it
you
wish
to
say
madam
my
father
is
not
here
that
just
what
i
want
to
find
out
about
put
in
the
woman
when
is
he
coming
back
i
do
not
know
answered
marco
that
it
said
beedle
you
old
enough
to
understand
that
two
big
lads
and
a
big
fellow
like
that
ca
have
food
and
lodgin
for
nothing
you
may
say
you
do
live
high
and
you
do
but
are
lodgin
and
rent
is
rent
if
your
father
coming
back
and
you
can
tell
me
when
i
may
be
obliged
to
let
the
rooms
over
your
heads
but
i
know
too
much
about
foreigners
to
let
bills
run
when
they
are
out
of
sight
your
father
out
of
sight
he
jerking
her
head
towards
lazarus
paid
me
for
last
week
how
do
i
know
he
will
pay
me
for
this
week
the
money
is
ready
roared
lazarus
the
rat
longed
to
burst
forth
he
knew
what
people
in
bone
court
said
to
a
woman
like
that
he
knew
the
exact
words
and
phrases
but
they
were
not
words
and
phrases
an
might
deliver
himself
of
in
the
presence
of
his
superior
officer
they
were
not
words
and
phrases
an
equerry
uses
at
court
he
dare
not
himself
to
burst
forth
he
stood
with
flaming
eyes
and
a
flaming
face
and
bit
his
lips
till
they
bled
he
wanted
to
strike
with
his
crutches
the
son
of
stefan
loristan
the
bearer
of
the
sign
there
sprang
up
before
his
furious
eyes
the
picture
of
the
luridly
lighted
cavern
and
the
frenzied
crowd
of
men
kneeling
at
this
same
boy
feet
kissing
them
kissing
his
hands
his
garments
the
very
earth
he
stood
upon
worshipping
him
while
above
the
altar
the
kingly
young
face
looked
on
with
the
nimbus
of
light
like
a
halo
above
it
if
he
dared
speak
his
mind
now
he
felt
he
could
have
endured
it
better
but
being
an
he
could
not
do
you
want
the
money
now
asked
marco
it
is
only
the
beginning
of
the
week
and
we
do
not
owe
it
to
you
until
the
week
is
over
is
it
that
you
want
to
have
it
now
lazarus
had
become
deadly
pale
he
looked
huge
in
his
fury
and
he
looked
dangerous
young
master
he
said
slowly
in
a
voice
as
deadly
as
his
pallor
and
he
actually
spoke
low
this
woman
beedle
drew
back
towards
the
steps
there
police
outside
she
shrilled
young
master
loristan
order
him
to
stand
back
no
one
will
hurt
you
said
marco
if
you
have
the
money
here
lazarus
please
give
it
to
me
lazarus
literally
ground
his
teeth
but
he
drew
himself
up
and
saluted
with
ceremony
he
put
his
hand
in
his
breast
pocket
and
produced
an
old
leather
wallet
there
were
but
a
few
coins
in
it
he
pointed
to
a
gold
one
i
obey
you
sir
since
i
must
he
said
breathing
hard
that
one
will
pay
her
for
the
week
marco
took
out
the
sovereign
and
held
it
out
to
the
woman
you
hear
what
he
says
he
said
at
the
end
of
this
week
if
there
is
not
enough
to
pay
for
the
next
we
will
go
lazarus
looked
so
like
a
hyena
only
held
back
from
springing
by
chains
of
steel
that
the
dusty
beedle
was
afraid
to
take
the
money
if
you
say
that
i
shall
not
lose
it
i
wait
until
the
week
ended
she
said
you
nothing
but
a
lad
but
you
like
your
father
got
a
way
that
a
body
can
trust
if
he
was
here
and
said
he
had
the
money
but
he
have
it
in
time
i
wait
if
it
was
for
a
month
he
pay
it
if
he
said
he
would
but
he
gone
and
two
boys
and
a
fellow
like
that
one
do
seem
much
to
depend
on
but
i
trust
be
good
enough
to
take
it
said
marco
and
he
put
the
coin
in
her
hand
and
turned
into
the
back
as
if
he
did
not
see
her
the
rat
and
lazarus
followed
him
is
there
so
little
money
left
said
marco
we
have
always
had
very
little
when
we
had
less
than
usual
we
lived
in
poorer
places
and
were
hungry
if
it
was
necessary
we
know
how
to
go
hungry
one
does
not
die
of
it
the
big
eyes
under
lazarus
beetling
brows
filled
with
tears
no
sir
he
said
one
does
not
die
of
hunger
but
the
insult
the
insult
that
is
not
endurable
she
would
not
have
spoken
if
my
father
had
been
here
marco
said
and
it
is
true
that
boys
like
us
have
no
money
is
there
enough
to
pay
for
another
week
yes
sir
answered
lazarus
swallowing
hard
as
if
he
had
a
lump
in
his
throat
perhaps
enough
for
two
if
we
eat
but
little
if
if
the
master
would
accept
money
from
those
who
would
give
it
he
would
always
have
had
enough
but
how
could
such
a
one
as
he
how
could
he
when
he
went
away
he
thought
he
thought
that
but
there
he
stopped
himself
suddenly
never
mind
said
marco
never
mind
we
will
go
away
the
day
we
can
pay
no
more
i
can
go
out
and
sell
newspapers
said
the
rat
sharp
voice
i
done
it
before
crutches
help
you
to
sell
them
the
platform
would
sell
faster
still
i
go
out
on
the
platform
i
can
sell
newspapers
too
said
marco
lazarus
uttered
an
exclamation
like
a
groan
sir
he
cried
no
no
am
i
not
here
to
go
out
and
look
for
work
i
can
carry
loads
i
can
run
errands
we
will
all
three
begin
to
see
what
we
can
do
marco
said
then
exactly
as
had
happened
on
the
day
of
their
return
from
their
journey
there
arose
in
the
road
outside
the
sound
of
newsboys
shouting
this
time
the
outcry
seemed
even
more
excited
than
before
the
boys
were
running
and
yelling
and
there
seemed
more
of
them
than
usual
and
above
all
other
words
was
heard
samavia
samavia
but
the
rat
did
not
rush
to
the
door
at
the
first
cry
he
stood
still
for
several
seconds
they
all
three
stood
still
listening
afterwards
each
one
remembered
and
told
the
others
that
he
had
stood
still
because
some
strange
strong
feeling
held
him
as
if
to
hear
some
great
thing
it
was
lazarus
who
went
out
of
the
room
first
and
the
rat
and
marco
followed
him
one
of
the
upstairs
lodgers
had
run
down
in
haste
and
opened
the
door
to
buy
newspapers
and
ask
questions
the
newsboys
were
wild
with
excitement
and
danced
about
as
they
shouted
the
piece
of
news
they
were
yelling
had
evidently
a
popular
quality
the
lodger
bought
two
papers
and
was
handing
out
coppers
to
a
lad
who
was
talking
loud
and
fast
here
a
go
he
was
saying
a
secret
party
risen
up
and
taken
samavia
night
and
mornin
they
done
it
that
there
lost
prince
descendant
turned
up
an
they
him
night
and
mornin
they
done
it
clapt
crown
on
so
they
lose
no
time
and
off
he
bolted
shouting
of
lost
prince
of
lost
prince
made
king
of
samavia
it
was
then
that
lazarus
forgetting
even
ceremony
bolted
also
he
bolted
back
to
the
rushed
in
and
the
door
fell
to
behind
him
marco
and
the
rat
found
it
shut
when
having
secured
a
newspaper
they
went
down
the
passage
at
the
closed
door
marco
stopped
he
did
not
turn
the
handle
from
the
inside
of
the
room
there
came
the
sound
of
big
convulsive
sobs
and
passionate
samavian
words
of
prayer
and
worshipping
gratitude
let
us
wait
marco
said
trembling
a
little
he
will
not
want
any
one
to
see
him
let
us
wait
his
black
pits
of
eyes
looked
immense
and
he
stood
at
his
tallest
but
he
was
trembling
slightly
from
head
to
foot
the
rat
had
begun
to
shake
as
if
from
an
ague
his
face
was
scarcely
human
in
its
fierce
unboyish
emotion
marco
marco
his
whisper
was
a
cry
that
was
what
he
went
for
he
yes
answered
marco
that
was
what
he
went
for
and
his
voice
was
unsteady
as
his
body
was
presently
the
sobs
inside
the
room
choked
themselves
back
suddenly
lazarus
had
remembered
they
had
guessed
he
had
been
leaning
against
the
wall
during
his
outburst
now
it
was
evident
that
he
stood
upright
probably
shocked
at
the
forgetfulness
of
his
frenzy
so
marco
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
and
went
into
the
room
he
shut
the
door
behind
him
and
they
all
three
stood
together
when
the
samavian
gives
way
to
his
emotions
he
is
emotional
indeed
lazarus
looked
as
if
a
storm
had
swept
over
him
he
had
choked
back
his
sobs
but
tears
still
swept
down
his
cheeks
sir
he
said
hoarsely
your
pardon
it
was
as
if
a
convulsion
seized
me
i
forgot
everything
even
my
duty
pardon
pardon
and
there
on
the
worn
carpet
of
the
dingy
back
in
the
marylebone
road
he
actually
went
on
one
knee
and
kissed
the
boy
hand
with
adoration
you
must
ask
pardon
said
marco
you
have
waited
so
long
good
friend
you
have
given
your
life
as
my
father
has
you
have
known
all
the
suffering
a
boy
has
not
lived
long
enough
to
understand
your
big
heart
your
faithful
heart
his
voice
broke
and
he
stood
and
looked
at
him
with
an
appeal
which
seemed
to
ask
him
to
remember
his
boyhood
and
understand
the
rest
do
kneel
he
said
next
you
must
kneel
and
lazarus
kissing
his
hand
again
rose
to
his
feet
now
we
shall
said
marco
now
the
waiting
will
soon
be
over
yes
sir
now
we
shall
receive
commands
lazarus
answered
the
rat
held
out
the
newspapers
may
we
read
them
yet
he
asked
until
further
orders
sir
said
lazarus
hurriedly
and
apologetically
until
further
orders
it
is
still
better
that
i
should
read
them
first
xxx
the
game
is
at
an
end
so
long
as
the
history
of
europe
is
written
and
read
the
unparalleled
story
of
the
rising
of
the
secret
party
in
samavia
will
stand
out
as
one
of
its
most
startling
and
romantic
records
every
detail
connected
with
the
astonishing
episode
from
beginning
to
end
was
romantic
even
when
it
was
most
productive
of
realistic
results
when
it
is
related
it
always
begins
with
the
story
of
the
tall
and
kingly
samavian
youth
who
walked
out
of
the
palace
in
the
early
morning
sunshine
singing
the
herdsmen
song
of
beauty
of
old
days
then
comes
the
outbreak
of
the
ruined
and
revolting
populace
then
the
legend
of
the
morning
on
the
mountain
side
and
the
old
shepherd
coming
out
of
his
cave
and
finding
the
apparently
dead
body
of
the
beautiful
young
hunter
then
the
secret
nursing
in
the
cavern
then
the
jolting
cart
piled
with
sheepskins
crossing
the
frontier
and
ending
its
journey
at
the
barred
entrance
of
the
monastery
and
leaving
its
mysterious
burden
behind
and
then
the
bitter
hate
and
struggle
of
dynasties
and
the
handful
of
shepherds
and
herdsmen
meeting
in
their
cavern
and
binding
themselves
and
their
unborn
sons
and
sons
sons
by
an
oath
never
to
be
broken
then
the
passing
of
generations
and
the
slaughter
of
peoples
and
the
changing
of
kings
and
always
that
oath
remembered
and
the
forgers
of
the
sword
at
their
secret
work
hidden
in
forests
and
caves
then
the
strange
story
of
the
uncrowned
kings
who
wandering
in
other
lands
lived
and
died
in
silence
and
seclusion
often
laboring
with
their
hands
for
their
daily
bread
but
never
forgetting
that
they
must
be
kings
and
ready
even
though
samavia
never
called
perhaps
the
whole
story
would
fill
too
many
volumes
to
admit
of
it
ever
being
told
fully
but
history
makes
the
growing
of
the
secret
party
clear
though
it
seems
almost
to
cease
to
be
history
in
spite
of
its
efforts
to
be
brief
and
speak
only
of
dull
facts
when
it
is
forced
to
deal
with
the
bearing
of
the
sign
by
two
mere
boys
who
being
blown
as
unremarked
as
any
two
grains
of
dust
across
europe
lit
the
lamp
whose
flame
so
flared
up
to
the
high
heavens
that
as
if
from
the
earth
itself
there
sprang
forth
samavians
by
the
thousands
ready
to
feed
it
iarovitch
and
maranovitch
swept
aside
forever
and
only
samavians
remaining
to
cry
aloud
in
ardent
praise
and
worship
of
the
god
who
had
brought
back
to
them
their
lost
prince
the
of
his
name
had
ended
every
battle
swords
fell
from
hands
because
swords
were
not
needed
the
iarovitch
fled
in
terror
and
dismay
the
maranovitch
were
nowhere
to
be
found
between
night
and
morning
as
the
newsboy
had
said
the
standard
of
ivor
was
raised
and
waved
from
palace
and
citadel
alike
from
mountain
forest
and
plain
from
city
village
and
town
its
followers
flocked
to
swear
allegiance
broken
and
wounded
legions
staggered
along
the
roads
to
join
and
kneel
to
it
women
and
children
followed
weeping
with
joy
and
chanting
songs
of
praise
the
powers
held
out
their
scepters
to
the
lately
prostrate
and
ignored
country
of
food
and
supplies
of
all
things
needed
began
to
cross
the
frontier
the
aid
of
nations
was
bestowed
samavia
at
peace
to
till
its
land
to
raise
its
flocks
to
mine
its
ores
would
be
able
to
pay
all
back
samavia
in
past
centuries
had
been
rich
enough
to
make
great
loans
and
had
stored
such
harvests
as
warring
countries
had
been
glad
to
call
upon
the
story
of
the
crowning
of
the
king
had
been
the
wildest
of
all
the
multitude
of
ecstatic
people
famished
in
rags
and
many
of
them
weak
with
wounds
kneeling
at
his
feet
praying
as
their
one
salvation
and
security
that
he
would
go
attended
by
them
to
their
bombarded
and
broken
cathedral
and
at
its
high
altar
let
the
crown
be
placed
upon
his
head
so
that
even
those
who
perhaps
must
die
of
their
past
sufferings
would
at
least
have
paid
their
poor
homage
to
the
king
ivor
who
would
rule
their
children
and
bring
back
to
samavia
her
honor
and
her
peace
ivor
ivor
they
chanted
like
a
prayer
ivor
ivor
in
their
houses
by
the
roadside
in
the
streets
the
story
of
the
coronation
in
the
shattered
cathedral
whose
roof
had
been
torn
to
fragments
by
bombs
said
an
important
london
paper
reads
like
a
legend
of
the
middle
ages
but
upon
the
whole
there
is
in
samavia
national
character
something
of
the
mediaeval
still
lazarus
having
bought
and
read
in
his
top
floor
room
every
newspaper
recording
the
details
which
had
reached
london
returned
to
report
almost
verbatim
standing
erect
before
marco
the
eyes
under
his
shaggy
brows
sometimes
flaming
with
exultation
sometimes
filled
with
a
rush
of
tears
he
could
not
be
made
to
sit
down
his
whole
big
body
seemed
to
have
become
rigid
with
magnificence
meeting
beedle
in
the
passage
he
strode
by
her
with
an
air
so
thunderous
that
she
turned
and
scuttled
back
to
her
cellar
kitchen
almost
falling
down
the
stone
steps
in
her
nervous
terror
in
such
a
mood
he
was
not
a
person
to
face
without
something
like
awe
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
rat
suddenly
spoke
to
marco
as
if
he
knew
that
he
was
awake
and
would
hear
him
he
has
given
all
his
life
to
samavia
he
said
when
you
traveled
from
country
to
country
and
lived
in
holes
and
corners
it
was
because
by
doing
it
he
could
escape
spies
and
see
the
people
who
must
be
made
to
understand
no
one
else
could
have
made
them
listen
an
emperor
would
have
begun
to
listen
when
he
had
seen
his
face
and
heard
his
voice
and
he
could
be
silent
and
wait
for
the
right
time
to
speak
he
could
keep
still
when
other
men
could
not
he
could
keep
his
face
still
and
his
hands
and
his
eyes
now
all
samavia
knows
what
he
has
done
and
that
he
has
been
the
greatest
patriot
in
the
world
we
both
saw
what
samavians
were
like
that
night
in
the
cavern
they
will
go
mad
with
joy
when
they
see
his
face
they
have
seen
it
now
said
marco
in
a
low
voice
from
his
bed
then
there
was
a
long
silence
though
it
was
not
quite
silence
because
the
rat
breathing
was
so
quick
and
hard
he
must
have
been
at
that
coronation
he
said
at
last
the
king
what
will
the
king
do
to
repay
him
marco
did
not
answer
his
breathing
could
be
heard
also
his
mind
was
picturing
that
same
coronation
the
shattered
roofless
cathedral
the
ruins
of
the
ancient
and
magnificent
high
altar
the
multitude
of
kneeling
people
the
wounded
and
bandaged
soldiery
and
the
king
and
his
father
where
had
his
father
stood
when
the
king
was
crowned
surely
he
had
stood
at
the
king
right
hand
and
the
people
had
adored
and
acclaimed
them
equally
king
ivor
he
murmured
as
if
he
were
in
a
dream
king
ivor
the
rat
started
up
on
his
elbow
you
will
see
him
he
cried
out
he
not
a
dream
any
longer
the
game
is
not
a
game
now
and
it
is
ended
it
is
won
it
was
real
was
real
marco
i
do
believe
you
hear
yes
i
do
answered
marco
but
it
is
almost
more
a
dream
than
when
it
was
one
the
greatest
patriot
in
the
world
is
like
a
king
himself
raved
the
rat
if
there
is
no
bigger
honor
to
give
him
he
will
be
made
a
prince
and
and
prime
minister
ca
you
hear
those
samavians
shouting
and
singing
and
praying
you
see
it
all
do
you
remember
the
mountain
climber
who
was
going
to
save
the
shoes
he
made
for
the
bearer
of
the
sign
he
said
a
great
day
might
come
when
one
could
show
them
to
the
people
it
come
he
show
them
i
know
how
they
take
it
his
voice
suddenly
dropped
as
if
it
dropped
into
a
pit
you
see
it
all
but
i
shall
not
then
marco
awoke
from
his
dream
and
lifted
his
head
why
not
he
demanded
it
sounded
like
a
demand
because
i
know
better
than
to
expect
it
the
rat
groaned
taken
me
a
long
way
but
you
ca
take
me
to
the
palace
of
a
king
not
such
a
fool
as
to
think
that
even
if
your
father
he
broke
off
because
marco
did
more
than
lift
his
head
he
sat
upright
you
bore
the
sign
as
much
as
i
did
he
said
we
bore
it
together
who
would
have
listened
to
cried
the
rat
were
the
son
of
stefan
loristan
you
were
the
friend
of
his
son
answered
marco
you
went
at
the
command
of
stefan
loristan
you
were
the
of
the
son
of
stefan
loristan
that
i
have
told
you
where
i
go
you
will
go
we
will
say
no
more
of
this
not
one
word
and
he
lay
down
again
in
the
silence
of
a
prince
of
the
blood
and
the
rat
knew
that
he
meant
what
he
said
and
that
stefan
loristan
also
would
mean
it
and
because
he
was
a
boy
he
began
to
wonder
what
beedle
would
do
when
she
heard
what
had
happened
what
had
been
happening
all
the
time
a
tall
shabby
foreigner
had
lived
in
her
dingy
back
and
been
closely
watched
lest
he
should
go
away
without
paying
his
rent
as
shabby
foreigners
sometimes
did
the
rat
saw
himself
managing
to
poise
himself
very
erect
on
his
crutches
while
he
told
her
that
the
shabby
foreigner
was
well
was
at
least
the
friend
of
a
king
and
had
given
him
his
crown
and
would
be
made
a
prince
and
a
and
a
prime
minister
because
there
was
no
higher
rank
or
honor
to
give
him
and
his
son
whom
she
had
insulted
was
samavia
idol
because
he
had
borne
the
sign
and
also
that
if
she
were
in
samavia
and
marco
chose
to
do
it
he
could
batter
her
wretched
to
the
ground
and
put
her
in
a
prison
and
serve
her
jolly
well
right
the
next
day
passed
and
the
next
and
then
there
came
a
letter
it
was
from
loristan
and
marco
turned
pale
when
lazarus
handed
it
to
him
lazarus
and
the
rat
went
out
of
the
room
at
once
and
left
him
to
read
it
alone
it
was
evidently
not
a
long
letter
because
it
was
not
many
minutes
before
marco
called
them
again
into
the
room
in
a
few
days
messengers
friends
of
my
father
will
come
to
take
us
to
samavia
you
and
i
and
lazarus
are
to
go
he
said
to
the
rat
god
be
thanked
said
lazarus
god
be
thanked
before
the
messengers
came
it
was
the
end
of
the
week
lazarus
had
packed
their
few
belongings
and
on
saturday
beedle
was
to
be
seen
hovering
at
the
top
of
the
cellar
steps
when
marco
and
the
rat
left
the
back
to
go
out
you
need
glare
at
me
she
said
to
lazarus
who
stood
glowering
at
the
door
which
he
had
opened
for
them
young
master
loristan
i
want
to
know
if
you
heard
when
your
father
is
coming
back
he
will
not
come
back
said
marco
he
wo
wo
he
well
how
about
next
week

said
beedle
your
man
been
packing
up
i
notice
he
not
got
much
to
carry
away
but
it
wo
pass
through
that
front
door
until
i
got
what
owing
me
people
that
can
pack
easy
think
they
can
get
away
easy
and
they
bear
watching
the
week
up
lazarus
wheeled
and
faced
her
with
a
furious
gesture
get
back
to
your
cellar
woman
he
commanded
get
back
under
ground
and
stay
there
look
at
what
is
stopping
before
your
miserable
gate
a
carriage
was
stopping
a
very
perfect
carriage
of
dark
brown
the
coachman
and
footman
wore
dark
brown
and
gold
liveries
and
the
footman
had
leaped
down
and
opened
the
door
with
respectful
alacrity
they
are
friends
of
the
master
come
to
pay
their
respects
to
his
son
said
lazarus
are
their
eyes
to
be
offended
by
the
sight
of
you
your
money
is
safe
said
marco
you
had
better
leave
us
beedle
gave
a
sharp
glance
at
the
two
gentlemen
who
had
entered
the
broken
gate
they
were
of
an
order
which
did
not
belong
to
philibert
place
they
looked
as
if
the
carriage
and
the
dark
brown
and
gold
liveries
were
affairs
to
them
at
all
events
they
two
grown
men
and
not
two
boys
without
a
penny
she
said
if
they
your
father
friends
they
tell
me
whether
my
rent
safe
or
not
the
two
visitors
were
upon
the
threshold
they
were
both
men
of
a
certain
dignity
of
type
and
when
lazarus
opened
wide
the
door
they
stepped
into
the
shabby
entrance
hall
as
if
they
did
not
see
it
they
looked
past
its
dinginess
and
past
lazarus
and
the
rat
and
beedle
them
as
it
were
at
marco
he
advanced
towards
them
at
once
you
come
from
my
father
he
said
and
gave
his
hand
first
to
the
elder
man
then
to
the
younger
yes
we
come
from
your
father
i
am
baron
rastka
and
this
is
the
count
vorversk
said
the
elder
man
bowing
if
they
barons
and
counts
and
friends
of
your
father
they
are
enough
to
be
responsible
for
you
said
beedle
rather
fiercely
because
she
was
somewhat
and
resented
the
fact
it
a
matter
of
next
week
rent
gentlemen
i
want
to
know
where
coming
from
the
elder
man
looked
at
her
with
a
swift
cold
glance
he
did
not
speak
to
her
but
to
lazarus
what
is
she
doing
here
he
demanded
marco
answered
him
she
is
afraid
we
can
not
pay
our
rent
he
said
it
is
of
great
importance
to
her
that
she
should
be
sure
take
her
away
said
the
gentleman
to
lazarus
he
did
not
even
glance
at
her
he
drew
something
from
his
and
handed
it
to
the
old
soldier
take
her
away
he
repeated
and
because
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
not
any
longer
a
person
at
all
beedle
actually
shuffled
down
the
passage
to
the
steps
lazarus
did
not
leave
her
until
he
too
had
descended
into
the
cellar
kitchen
where
he
stood
and
towered
above
her
like
an
infuriated
giant
he
will
be
on
his
way
to
samavia
miserable
woman
he
said
before
he
goes
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
implore
his
pardon
but
beedle
point
of
view
was
not
his
she
had
recovered
some
of
her
breath
i
do
know
where
samavia
is
she
raged
as
she
struggled
to
set
her
dusty
black
cap
straight
i
warrant
it
one
of
these
little
foreign
countries
you
can
scarcely
see
on
the
map
and
not
a
decent
english
town
in
it
he
can
go
as
soon
as
he
likes
so
long
as
he
pays
his
rent
before
he
does
it
samavia
indeed
you
talk
as
if
he
was
buckingham
palace
xxxi
the
son
of
stefan
loristan
when
a
party
composed
of
two
boys
attended
by
a
big
soldierly
and
accompanied
by
two
elderly
men
of
a
marked
foreign
type
appeared
on
the
platform
of
charing
cross
station
they
attracted
a
good
deal
of
attention
in
fact
the
good
looks
and
strong
body
of
the
handsome
lad
with
the
thick
black
hair
would
have
caused
eyes
to
turn
towards
him
even
if
he
had
not
seemed
to
be
regarded
as
so
special
a
charge
by
those
who
were
with
him
but
in
a
country
where
people
are
accustomed
to
seeing
a
certain
manner
and
certain
forms
observed
in
the
case
of
persons
however
young
who
are
set
apart
by
the
fortune
of
rank
and
distinction
and
where
the
populace
also
rather
enjoys
the
sight
of
such
demeanor
it
was
inevitable
that
more
than
one
should
comment
on
the
fact
that
this
was
not
an
ordinary
group
of
individuals
see
that
fine
big
lad
over
there
said
a
workman
whose
head
with
a
pipe
in
its
mouth
stuck
out
of
a
smoking
carriage
window
he
some
sort
of
a
young
swell
i
lay
a
shillin
take
a
look
at
him
to
his
mate
inside
the
mate
took
a
look
the
pair
were
of
the
decent
type
and
were
shrewd
at
observation
yes
he
some
sort
of
young
swell
he
summed
him
up
but
he
not
english
by
a
long
chalk
he
must
be
a
young
turk
or
russian
sent
over
to
be
educated
his
suite
looks
like
it
all
but
the
chap
on
crutches
wonder
what
he
is
a
looking
guard
was
passing
and
the
first
man
hailed
him
have
we
got
any
swells
traveling
with
us
this
morning
he
asked
jerking
his
head
towards
the
group
that
looks
like
it
any
one
leaving
windsor
or
sandringham
to
cross
from
dover
the
man
looked
at
the
group
curiously
for
a
moment
and
then
shook
his
head
they
do
look
like
something
or
other
he
answered
but
no
one
knows
anything
about
them
everybody
safe
in
buckingham
palace
and
marlborough
house
this
week
no
one
either
going
or
coming
no
observer
it
is
true
could
have
mistaken
lazarus
for
an
ordinary
attendant
escorting
an
ordinary
charge
if
silence
had
not
still
been
strictly
the
order
he
could
not
have
restrained
himself
as
it
was
he
bore
himself
like
a
grenadier
and
stood
by
marco
as
if
across
his
dead
body
alone
could
any
one
approach
the
lad
until
we
reach
melzarr
he
had
said
with
passion
to
the
two
gentlemen
until
i
can
stand
before
my
master
and
behold
him
embrace
his
son
him
i
implore
that
i
may
not
lose
sight
of
him
night
or
day
on
my
knees
i
implore
that
i
may
travel
armed
at
his
side
i
am
but
his
servant
and
have
no
right
to
occupy
a
place
in
the
same
carriage
but
put
me
anywhere
i
will
be
deaf
dumb
blind
to
all
but
himself
only
permit
me
to
be
near
enough
to
give
my
life
if
it
is
needed
let
me
say
to
my
master
never
left
him
we
will
find
a
place
for
you
the
elder
man
said
and
if
you
are
so
anxious
you
may
sleep
across
his
threshold
when
we
spend
the
night
at
a
hotel
i
will
not
sleep
said
lazarus
i
will
watch
suppose
there
should
be
demons
of
maranovitch
loose
and
infuriated
in
europe
who
knows
the
maranovitch
and
iarovitch
who
have
not
already
sworn
allegiance
to
king
ivor
are
dead
on
battlefields
the
remainder
are
now
fedorovitch
and
praising
god
for
their
king
was
the
answer
baron
rastka
made
him
but
lazarus
kept
his
guard
unbroken
when
he
occupied
the
next
compartment
to
the
one
in
which
marco
traveled
he
stood
in
the
corridor
throughout
the
journey
when
they
descended
at
any
point
to
change
trains
he
followed
close
at
the
boy
heels
his
fierce
eyes
on
every
side
at
once
and
his
hand
on
the
weapon
hidden
in
his
broad
leather
belt
when
they
stopped
to
rest
in
some
city
he
planted
himself
in
a
chair
by
the
bedroom
door
of
his
charge
and
if
he
slept
he
was
not
aware
that
nature
had
betrayed
him
into
doing
so
if
the
journey
made
by
the
young
bearers
of
the
sign
had
been
a
strange
one
this
was
strange
by
its
very
contrast
throughout
that
pilgrimage
two
waifs
in
worn
clothes
had
traveled
from
one
place
to
another
sometimes
in
or
continental
railroad
carriages
sometimes
in
jolting
diligences
sometimes
in
carts
sometimes
on
foot
by
side
roads
and
mountain
paths
and
forest
ways
now
two
boys
in
the
charge
of
two
men
of
the
class
whose
orders
are
obeyed
journeyed
in
compartments
reserved
for
them
their
traveling
appurtenances
supplying
every
comfort
that
luxury
could
provide
the
rat
had
not
known
that
there
were
people
who
traveled
in
such
a
manner
that
wants
could
be
so
perfectly
foreseen
that
railroad
officials
porters
at
stations
the
staff
of
restaurants
could
be
by
magic
transformed
into
active
and
eager
servants
to
lean
against
the
upholstered
back
of
a
railway
carriage
and
in
luxurious
ease
look
through
the
window
at
passing
beauties
and
then
to
find
books
at
your
elbow
and
excellent
meals
appearing
at
regular
hours
these
unknown
perfections
made
it
necessary
for
him
at
times
to
pull
himself
together
and
give
all
his
energies
to
believing
that
he
was
quite
awake
awake
he
was
and
with
much
on
his
mind
to
work
out
so
much
indeed
that
on
the
first
day
of
the
journey
he
had
decided
to
give
up
the
struggle
and
wait
until
fate
made
clear
to
him
such
things
as
he
was
to
be
allowed
to
understand
of
the
mystery
of
stefan
loristan
what
he
realized
most
clearly
was
that
the
fact
that
the
son
of
stefan
loristan
was
being
escorted
in
private
state
to
the
country
his
father
had
given
his
life
work
to
was
never
for
a
moment
forgotten
the
baron
rastka
and
count
vorversk
were
of
the
dignity
and
courteous
reserve
which
marks
men
of
distinction
marco
was
not
a
mere
boy
to
them
he
was
the
son
of
stefan
loristan
and
they
were
samavians
they
watched
over
him
not
as
lazarus
did
but
with
a
gravity
and
forethought
which
somehow
seemed
to
encircle
him
with
a
rampart
without
any
air
of
subservience
they
constituted
themselves
his
attendants
his
comfort
his
pleasure
even
his
entertainment
were
their
private
care
the
rat
felt
sure
they
intended
that
if
possible
he
should
enjoy
his
journey
and
that
he
should
not
be
fatigued
by
it
they
conversed
with
him
as
the
rat
had
not
known
that
men
ever
conversed
with
boys
until
he
had
met
loristan
it
was
plain
that
they
knew
what
he
would
be
most
interested
in
and
that
they
were
aware
he
was
as
familiar
with
the
history
of
samavia
as
they
were
themselves
when
he
showed
a
disposition
to
hear
of
events
which
had
occurred
they
were
as
prompt
to
follow
his
lead
as
they
would
have
been
to
follow
the
lead
of
a
man
that
the
rat
argued
with
himself
was
because
marco
had
lived
so
intimately
with
his
father
that
his
life
had
been
more
like
a
man
than
a
boy
and
had
trained
him
in
mature
thinking
he
was
very
quiet
during
the
journey
and
the
rat
knew
he
was
thinking
all
the
time
the
night
before
they
reached
melzarr
they
slept
at
a
town
some
hours
distant
from
the
capital
they
arrived
at
midnight
and
went
to
a
quiet
hotel
said
marco
when
the
rat
had
left
him
for
the
night
we
shall
see
him
god
be
thanked
god
be
thanked
said
the
rat
also
and
each
saluted
the
other
before
they
parted
in
the
morning
lazarus
came
into
the
bedroom
with
an
air
so
solemn
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
garments
he
carried
in
his
hands
were
part
of
some
religious
ceremony
i
am
at
your
command
sir
he
said
and
i
bring
you
your
uniform
he
carried
in
fact
a
richly
decorated
samavian
uniform
and
the
first
thing
marco
had
seen
when
he
entered
was
that
lazarus
himself
was
in
uniform
also
his
was
the
uniform
of
an
officer
of
the
king
body
guard
the
master
he
said
asks
that
you
wear
this
on
your
entrance
to
melzarr
i
have
a
uniform
also
for
your
when
rastka
and
vorversk
appeared
they
were
in
uniforms
also
it
was
a
uniform
which
had
a
touch
of
the
orient
in
its
picturesque
splendor
a
short
mantle
hung
by
a
jeweled
chain
from
the
shoulders
and
there
was
much
magnificent
embroidery
of
color
and
gold
sir
we
must
drive
quickly
to
the
station
baron
rastka
said
to
marco
these
people
are
excitable
and
patriotic
and
his
majesty
wishes
us
to
remain
incognito
and
avoid
all
chance
of
public
demonstration
until
we
reach
the
capital
they
passed
rather
hurriedly
through
the
hotel
to
the
carriage
which
awaited
them
the
rat
saw
that
something
unusual
was
happening
in
the
place
servants
were
scurrying
round
corners
and
guests
were
coming
out
of
their
rooms
and
even
hanging
over
the
balustrades
as
marco
got
into
his
carriage
he
caught
sight
of
a
boy
about
his
own
age
who
was
peeping
from
behind
a
bush
suddenly
he
darted
away
and
they
all
saw
him
tearing
down
the
street
towards
the
station
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
carry
him
but
the
horses
were
faster
than
he
was
the
party
reached
the
station
and
was
escorted
quickly
to
its
place
in
a
special
which
awaited
it
as
the
train
made
its
way
out
of
the
station
marco
saw
the
boy
who
had
run
before
them
rush
on
to
the
platform
waving
his
arms
and
shouting
something
with
wild
delight
the
people
who
were
standing
about
turned
to
look
at
him
and
the
next
instant
they
had
all
torn
off
their
caps
and
thrown
them
up
in
the
air
and
were
shouting
also
but
it
was
not
possible
to
hear
what
they
said
we
were
only
just
in
time
said
vorversk
and
baron
rastka
nodded
the
train
went
swiftly
and
stopped
only
once
before
they
reached
melzarr
this
was
at
a
small
station
on
the
platform
of
which
stood
peasants
with
big
baskets
of
garlanded
flowers
and
evergreens
they
put
them
on
the
train
and
soon
both
marco
and
the
rat
saw
that
something
unusual
was
taking
place
at
one
time
a
man
standing
on
the
narrow
outside
platform
of
the
carriage
was
plainly
seen
to
be
securing
garlands
and
handing
up
flags
to
men
who
worked
on
the
roof
they
are
doing
something
with
samavian
flags
and
a
lot
of
flowers
and
green
things
cried
the
rat
in
excitement
sir
they
are
decorating
the
outside
of
the
carriage
vorversk
said
the
villagers
on
the
line
obtained
permission
from
his
majesty
the
son
of
stefan
loristan
could
not
be
allowed
to
pass
their
homes
without
their
doing
homage
i
understand
said
marco
his
heart
thumping
hard
against
his
uniform
it
is
for
my
father
sake
at
last
embowered
garlanded
and
hung
with
waving
banners
the
train
drew
in
at
the
chief
station
at
melzarr
sir
said
rastka
as
they
were
entering
will
you
stand
up
that
the
people
may
see
you
those
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
will
have
the
merest
glimpse
but
they
will
never
forget
marco
stood
up
the
others
grouped
themselves
behind
him
there
arose
a
roar
of
voices
which
ended
almost
in
a
shriek
of
joy
which
was
like
the
shriek
of
a
tempest
then
there
burst
forth
the
blare
of
brazen
instruments
playing
the
national
hymn
of
samavia
and
mad
voices
joined
in
it
if
marco
had
not
been
a
strong
boy
and
long
trained
in
what
he
saw
and
heard
might
have
been
almost
too
much
to
be
borne
when
the
train
had
come
to
a
full
stop
and
the
door
was
thrown
open
even
rastka
dignified
voice
was
unsteady
as
he
said
sir
lead
the
way
it
is
for
us
to
follow
and
marco
erect
in
the
doorway
stood
for
a
moment
looking
out
upon
the
roaring
acclaiming
weeping
singing
and
swaying
multitude
and
saluted
just
as
he
had
saluted
the
squad
looking
just
as
much
a
boy
just
as
much
a
man
just
as
much
a
thrilling
young
human
being
then
at
the
sight
of
him
standing
so
it
seemed
as
if
the
crowd
went
mad
as
the
forgers
of
the
sword
had
seemed
to
go
mad
on
the
night
in
the
cavern
the
tumult
rose
and
rose
the
crowd
rocked
and
leapt
and
in
its
frenzy
of
emotion
threatened
to
crush
itself
to
death
but
for
the
lines
of
soldiers
there
would
have
seemed
no
chance
for
any
one
to
pass
through
it
alive
i
am
the
son
of
stefan
loristan
marco
said
to
himself
in
order
to
hold
himself
steady
i
am
on
my
way
to
my
father
afterward
he
was
moving
through
the
line
of
guarding
soldiers
to
the
entrance
where
two
great
stood
and
there
outside
waited
even
a
huger
and
more
frenzied
crowd
than
that
left
behind
he
saluted
there
again
and
again
and
again
on
all
sides
it
was
what
they
had
seen
the
emperor
do
in
vienna
he
was
not
an
emperor
but
he
was
the
son
of
stefan
loristan
who
had
brought
back
the
king
you
must
salute
too
he
said
to
the
rat
when
they
got
into
the
state
carriage
perhaps
my
father
has
told
them
it
seems
as
if
they
knew
you
the
rat
had
been
placed
beside
him
on
the
carriage
seat
he
was
inwardly
shuddering
with
a
rapture
of
exultation
which
was
almost
anguish
the
people
were
looking
at
him
shouting
at
him
surely
it
seemed
like
it
when
he
looked
at
the
faces
nearest
in
the
crowd
perhaps
loristan
listen
said
marco
suddenly
as
the
carriage
rolled
on
its
way
they
are
shouting
to
us
in
samavian
bearers
of
the
sign
that
is
what
they
are
saying
now
bearers
of
the
sign
they
were
being
taken
to
the
palace
that
baron
rastka
and
count
vorversk
had
explained
in
the
train
his
majesty
wished
to
receive
them
stefan
loristan
was
there
also
the
city
had
once
been
noble
and
majestic
it
was
somewhat
oriental
as
its
uniforms
and
national
costumes
were
there
were
domed
and
pillared
structures
of
white
stone
and
marble
there
were
great
arches
and
city
gates
and
churches
but
many
of
them
were
half
in
ruins
through
war
and
neglect
and
decay
they
passed
the
cathedral
standing
in
the
sunshine
in
its
great
square
still
in
all
its
disaster
one
of
the
most
beautiful
structures
in
europe
in
the
exultant
crowd
were
still
to
be
seen
haggard
faces
men
with
bandaged
limbs
and
heads
or
hobbling
on
sticks
and
crutches
the
richly
colored
native
costumes
were
most
of
them
worn
to
rags
but
their
wearers
had
the
faces
of
creatures
plucked
from
despair
to
be
lifted
to
heaven
ivor
ivor
they
cried
ivor
ivor
and
sobbed
with
rapture
the
palace
was
as
wonderful
in
its
way
as
the
white
cathedral
the
immensely
wide
steps
of
marble
were
guarded
by
soldiers
the
huge
square
in
which
it
stood
was
filled
with
people
whom
the
soldiers
held
in
check
i
am
his
son
marco
said
to
himself
as
he
descended
from
the
state
carriage
and
began
to
walk
up
the
steps
which
seemed
so
enormously
wide
that
they
appeared
almost
like
a
street
up
he
mounted
step
by
step
the
rat
following
him
and
as
he
turned
from
side
to
side
to
salute
those
who
made
deep
obeisance
as
he
passed
he
began
to
realize
that
he
had
seen
their
faces
before
these
who
are
guarding
the
steps
he
said
quickly
under
his
breath
to
the
rat
are
the
forgers
of
the
sword
there
were
rich
uniforms
everywhere
when
he
entered
the
palace
and
people
who
bowed
almost
to
the
ground
as
he
passed
he
was
very
young
to
be
confronted
with
such
an
adoring
adulation
and
royal
ceremony
but
he
hoped
it
would
not
last
too
long
and
that
after
he
had
knelt
to
the
king
and
kissed
his
hand
he
would
see
his
father
and
hear
his
voice
just
to
hear
his
voice
again
and
feel
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
through
the
vaulted
corridors
to
the
doors
of
a
magnificent
room
he
was
led
at
last
the
end
of
it
seemed
a
long
way
off
as
he
entered
there
were
many
richly
dressed
people
who
stood
in
line
as
he
passed
up
toward
the
canopied
dais
he
felt
that
he
had
grown
pale
with
the
strain
of
excitement
and
he
had
begun
to
feel
that
he
must
be
walking
in
a
dream
as
on
each
side
people
bowed
low
and
curtsied
to
the
ground
he
realized
vaguely
that
the
king
himself
was
standing
awaiting
his
approach
but
as
he
advanced
each
step
bearing
him
nearer
to
the
throne
the
light
and
color
about
him
the
strangeness
and
magnificence
the
wildly
joyous
acclamation
of
the
populace
outside
the
palace
made
him
feel
rather
dazzled
and
he
did
not
clearly
see
any
one
single
face
or
thing
his
majesty
awaits
you
said
a
voice
behind
him
which
seemed
to
be
baron
rastka
are
you
faint
sir
you
look
pale
he
drew
himself
together
and
lifted
his
eyes
for
one
full
moment
after
he
had
so
lifted
them
he
stood
quite
still
and
straight
looking
into
the
deep
beauty
of
the
royal
face
then
he
knelt
and
kissed
the
hands
held
out
to
him
kissed
them
both
with
a
passion
of
boy
love
and
worship
the
king
had
the
eyes
he
had
longed
to
see
the
king
hands
were
those
he
had
longed
to
feel
again
upon
his
shoulder
the
king
was
his
father
the
stefan
loristan
who
had
been
the
last
of
those
who
had
waited
and
labored
for
samavia
through
five
hundred
years
and
who
had
lived
and
died
kings
though
none
of
them
till
now
had
worn
a
crown
his
father
was
the
king
it
was
not
that
night
nor
the
next
nor
for
many
nights
that
the
telling
of
the
story
was
completed
the
people
knew
that
their
king
and
his
son
were
rarely
separated
from
each
other
that
the
prince
suite
of
apartments
were
connected
by
a
private
passage
with
his
father
the
two
were
bound
together
by
an
affection
of
singular
strength
and
meaning
and
their
love
for
their
people
added
to
their
feeling
for
each
other
in
the
history
of
what
their
past
had
been
there
was
a
romance
which
swelled
the
emotional
samavian
heart
near
to
bursting
by
mountain
fires
in
huts
under
the
stars
in
fields
and
in
forests
all
that
was
known
of
their
story
was
told
and
retold
a
thousand
times
with
sobs
of
joy
and
prayer
breaking
in
upon
the
tale
but
none
knew
it
as
it
was
told
in
a
certain
quiet
but
stately
room
in
the
palace
where
the
man
once
known
only
as
stefan
loristan
but
whom
history
would
call
the
first
king
ivor
of
samavia
told
his
share
of
it
to
the
boy
whom
samavians
had
a
strange
and
superstitious
worship
for
because
he
seemed
so
surely
their
lost
prince
restored
in
body
and
soul
almost
the
kingly
lad
in
the
ancient
portrait
some
of
them
half
believed
when
he
stood
in
the
sunshine
with
the
halo
about
his
head
it
was
a
wonderful
and
intense
story
that
of
the
long
wanderings
and
the
close
hiding
of
the
dangerous
secret
among
all
those
who
had
known
that
a
man
who
was
an
impassioned
patriot
was
laboring
for
samavia
and
using
all
the
power
of
a
great
mind
and
the
delicate
ingenuity
of
a
great
genius
to
gain
friends
and
favor
for
his
unhappy
country
there
had
been
but
one
who
had
known
that
stefan
loristan
had
a
claim
to
the
samavian
throne
he
had
made
no
claim
he
had
sought
not
a
crown
but
the
final
freedom
of
the
nation
for
which
his
love
had
been
a
religion
not
the
crown
he
said
to
the
two
young
bearers
of
the
sign
as
they
sat
at
his
feet
like
schoolboys
not
a
throne
life
of
my
life
for
samavia
that
was
what
i
worked
for
what
we
have
all
worked
for
if
there
had
risen
a
wiser
man
in
samavia
time
of
need
it
would
not
have
been
for
me
to
remind
them
of
their
lost
prince
i
could
have
stood
aside
but
no
man
arose
the
crucial
moment
came
and
the
one
man
who
knew
the
secret
revealed
it
then
samavia
called
and
i
answered
he
put
his
hand
on
the
thick
black
hair
of
his
boy
head
there
was
a
thing
we
never
spoke
of
together
he
said
i
believed
always
that
your
mother
died
of
her
bitter
fears
for
me
and
the
unending
strain
of
them
she
was
very
young
and
loving
and
knew
that
there
was
no
day
when
we
parted
that
we
were
sure
of
seeing
each
other
alive
again
when
she
died
she
begged
me
to
promise
that
your
boyhood
and
youth
should
not
be
burdened
by
the
knowledge
she
had
found
it
so
terrible
to
bear
i
should
have
kept
the
secret
from
you
even
if
she
had
not
so
implored
me
i
had
never
meant
that
you
should
know
the
truth
until
you
were
a
man
if
i
had
died
a
certain
document
would
have
been
sent
to
you
which
would
have
left
my
task
in
your
hands
and
made
my
plans
clear
you
would
have
known
then
that
you
also
were
a
prince
ivor
who
must
take
up
his
country
burden
and
be
ready
when
samavia
called
i
tried
to
help
you
to
train
yourself
for
any
task
you
never
failed
me
your
majesty
said
the
rat
i
began
to
work
it
out
and
think
it
must
be
true
that
night
when
we
were
with
the
old
woman
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
it
was
the
way
she
looked
at
at
his
highness
say
threw
in
prince
ivor
it
easier
he
was
my
army
father
stefan
loristan
grave
eyes
melted
say
he
said
you
were
his
army
and
more
when
we
both
needed
one
it
was
you
who
invented
the
game
thanks
your
majesty
said
the
rat
reddening
scarlet
you
do
me
great
honor
but
he
would
never
let
me
wait
on
him
when
we
were
traveling
he
said
we
were
nothing
but
two
boys
i
suppose
that
why
it
hard
to
remember
at
first
but
my
mind
went
on
working
until
sometimes
i
was
afraid
i
might
let
something
out
at
the
wrong
time
when
we
went
down
into
the
cavern
and
i
saw
the
forgers
of
the
sword
go
mad
over
him
i
it
must
be
true
but
i
did
dare
to
speak
i
knew
you
meant
us
to
wait
so
i
waited
you
are
a
faithful
friend
said
the
king
and
you
have
always
obeyed
orders
a
great
moon
was
sailing
in
the
sky
that
night
just
such
a
moon
as
had
sailed
among
the
torn
rifts
of
storm
clouds
when
the
prince
at
vienna
had
come
out
upon
the
balcony
and
the
boyish
voice
had
startled
him
from
the
darkness
of
the
garden
below
the
clearer
light
of
this
splendor
drew
them
out
on
a
balcony
also
a
broad
balcony
of
white
marble
which
looked
like
snow
the
pure
radiance
fell
upon
all
they
saw
spread
before
them
the
lovely
but
city
the
great
palace
square
with
its
broken
statues
and
arches
the
splendid
ghost
of
the
unroofed
cathedral
whose
high
altar
was
bare
to
the
sky
they
stood
and
looked
at
it
there
was
a
stillness
in
which
all
the
world
might
have
ceased
breathing
what
next
said
prince
ivor
at
last
speaking
quietly
and
low
what
next
father
great
things
which
will
come
one
by
one
said
the
king
if
we
hold
ourselves
ready
prince
ivor
turned
his
face
from
the
lovely
white
broken
city
and
put
his
brown
hand
on
his
father
arm
upon
the
ledge
that
night
he
said
father
you
remember
the
king
was
looking
far
away
but
he
bent
his
head
yes
that
will
come
too
he
said
can
you
repeat
it
yes
said
ivor
and
so
can
the
we
said
it
a
hundred
times
we
believe
it
true
the
descendant
of
the
lost
prince
is
brought
back
to
rule
in
samavia
he
will
teach
his
people
the
law
of
the
one
from
his
throne
he
will
teach
his
son
and
that
son
will
teach
his
son
and
he
will
teach
his
and
through
such
as
these
the
whole
world
will
learn
the
order
and
the
law
