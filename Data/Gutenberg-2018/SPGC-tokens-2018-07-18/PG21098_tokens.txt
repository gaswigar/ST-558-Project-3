the
independence
of
claire
by
mrs
george
de
horne
vaizey
this
is
a
rather
typical
horne
vaizey
book
about
the
life
led
by
young
women
in
edwardian
times
worries
about
money
about
who
to
marry
whether
to
go
or
not
to
parties
to
be
given
by
elderly
hostesses
about
clothes
about
and
even
as
so
often
in
this
author
books
with
a
bit
of
illness
thrown
in
as
well
there
a
time
when
claire
seems
on
the
way
to
making
a
big
mistake
but
it
all
gets
sorted
out
in
the
end
make
an
audiobook
of
this
book
that
is
probably
the
best
way
to
enjoy
it
the
independence
of
claire
by
george
de
horne
vaizey
chapter
one
i
have
to
do
it
claire
gifford
stood
in
the
salon
of
the
brussels
pension
which
had
been
her
home
for
the
last
three
years
and
bent
her
brows
in
consideration
of
an
problem
can
i
marry
him
she
asked
herself
once
and
again
with
the
baffling
result
that
every
single
time
her
brain
answered
instantly
the
while
her
heart
rose
up
in
rebellion
and
cried
i
wo
many
girls
have
found
themselves
in
the
same
predicament
before
and
since
but
few
have
had
stronger
reasons
for
sacrificing
personal
inclination
on
the
altar
of
filial
duty
than
claire
knew
at
this
minute
to
begin
with
the
relationship
between
herself
and
her
mother
was
more
intimate
than
is
usually
the
case
for
claire
was
an
only
child
and
mrs
gifford
a
widow
only
eighteen
years
older
than
herself
briefly
stated
the
family
history
was
as
follows
eleanor
guyther
had
been
the
only
child
of
stern
parents
and
at
seventeen
had
run
away
from
the
house
which
had
been
more
like
a
prison
than
a
home
to
marry
a
handsome
young
artist
who
had
been
painting
in
the
neighbourhood
during
the
summer
months
a
handsome
boy
of
whose
portrait
claire
treasured
in
an
gold
locket
long
since
discarded
by
her
mother
who
followed
the
fashion
in
jewellery
as
well
as
in
dress
it
was
strange
to
look
at
the
face
of
a
father
who
was
no
older
than
oneself
and
claire
had
spent
many
hours
gazing
at
the
pictured
face
and
trying
to
gain
from
it
some
idea
of
the
personality
of
the
man
of
whom
her
mother
persistently
refused
to
speak
mrs
gifford
shrank
from
all
disagreeables
great
and
small
and
systematically
turned
her
back
on
anything
which
was
disturbing
or
painful
so
that
it
was
only
from
chance
remarks
that
her
daughter
had
gained
any
information
about
the
past
she
knew
that
her
father
had
been
a
successful
artist
although
not
in
the
highest
sense
of
the
term
he
had
a
trick
of
turning
out
pretty
domestic
pictures
which
appealed
to
the
taste
of
the
million
and
which
being
purchased
by
enterprising
dealers
were
reproduced
in
cheap
prints
to
deck
the
walls
of
suburban
parlours
while
he
lived
he
made
a
sufficient
income
and
before
his
death
a
formal
reconciliation
had
taken
place
between
the
runaway
daughter
and
her
parents
from
whom
she
later
inherited
the
money
which
had
supported
herself
and
her
daughter
throughout
the
years
of
her
widowhood
claire
had
the
vaguest
idea
as
to
the
amount
of
her
mother
means
for
until
the
last
few
years
the
question
of
money
had
never
arisen
they
had
simply
decided
what
they
wished
to
do
without
considering
the
cost
but
of
late
there
had
been
seasons
of
financial
tightness
and
the
morning
on
which
this
history
begins
had
brought
a
most
disagreeable
awakening
mrs
gifford
was
seated
in
the
salon
staring
disconsolately
at
a
note
which
had
just
arrived
by
the
afternoon
post
it
was
a
very
disagreeable
note
for
it
stated
in
brief
and
callous
terms
that
her
account
at
the
bank
was
overdrawn
to
the
extent
of
three
hundred
francs
and
politely
requested
that
the
deficit
should
be
made
good
claire
looked
flushed
and
angry
mrs
gifford
looked
pathetic
and
pale
it
seemed
in
the
first
place
quite
ludicrous
that
such
a
relationship
as
that
of
mother
and
daughter
should
exist
between
two
women
who
looked
so
nearly
of
an
age
and
mrs
gifford
youthful
appearance
was
a
standing
joke
in
the
pension
every
new
visitor
was
questioned
by
madame
as
to
the
relationship
between
the
two
english
ladies
and
never
had
one
of
the
number
failed
to
reply
sisters
and
to
be
convulsed
with
astonishment
when
corrected
and
in
good
truth
mrs
gifford
was
a
wonderful
specimen
of
the
prolonged
youth
which
is
a
phenomenon
of
the
present
day
she
was
slight
she
was
graceful
her
waving
brown
hair
was
as
naturally
luxuriant
as
that
of
a
girl
her
complexion
was
smooth
and
fair
her
pretty
features
were
unchanged
she
dressed
with
good
taste
and
though
secretly
proud
of
her
youthful
looks
was
never
so
foolish
as
to
adopt
kittenish
airs
to
match
her
manner
was
quiet
gracious
appealing
a
little
air
of
pathos
enveloped
her
like
a
mist
on
strangers
she
made
the
impression
of
a
lovely
creature
who
had
known
suffering
everybody
was
kind
to
mrs
gifford
and
she
in
return
had
never
been
known
to
utter
an
unkind
word
she
had
been
born
with
the
faculty
of
loving
everybody
a
little
and
no
one
very
much
which
if
one
comes
to
think
of
it
is
the
most
powerful
of
all
factors
towards
securing
an
easy
life
since
it
secures
the
owner
from
the
possibility
of
keen
personal
suffering
at
the
present
moment
mrs
gifford
did
however
look
really
perturbed
for
after
shutting
her
eyes
to
a
disagreeable
fact
and
keeping
them
shut
with
much
resolution
and
it
must
be
added
ease
for
many
years
past
she
was
now
driven
to
face
the
truth
and
to
break
it
to
her
daughter
into
the
bargain
but
i
do
understand
claire
repeated
blankly
how
the
money
be
gone
we
have
spent
no
more
this
year
than
for
years
past
i
should
think
we
have
spent
less
i
have
been
extravagant
a
bit
you
offered
me
a
new
hat
only
last
week
and
i
said
i
could
do
without
yes
yes
of
course
it
quite
true
you
have
been
most
good
but
you
see
ours
has
not
been
a
case
of
an
income
that
goes
on
year
after
year
it
never
was
even
from
the
beginning
there
was
not
enough
and
you
have
a
good
education
did
you
i
spared
nothing
on
it
it
folly
to
stint
on
a
girl
it
was
one
of
the
best
schools
in
paris
it
was
mother
but
we
are
not
talking
about
schools
do
let
us
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
horrid
muddle
if
it
is
a
case
of
what
can
it
be
i
ignorant
about
money
for
you
have
always
managed
business
matters
but
i
ca
see
what
else
we
can
have
been
living
upon
mrs
gifford
crinkled
her
delicate
brows
and
adopted
an
air
of
plaintive
i
sure
it
as
great
a
shock
to
me
as
it
is
to
you
but
under
the
circumstances
i
do
think
i
managed
very
well
it
was
only
nine
thousand
pounds
at
the
beginning
and
i
made
it
last
over
thirteen
years
your
education
and
since
we
been
here
for
the
last
three
years
i
given
you
a
good
time
and
taken
you
to
everything
that
was
going
on
naturally
it
all
costs
naturally
money
ca
last
for
ever
the
blood
flooded
the
girl
face
now
at
last
she
understand
and
the
knowledge
filled
her
with
awe
mother
do
you
mean
that
we
have
been
living
all
this
time
on
mrs
gifford
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
extended
her
hands
in
an
attitude
typically
french
what
would
you
interest
is
so
ridiculously
low
they
offered
me
three
per
cent
four
was
considered
high
how
could
we
have
lived
on
less
than
three
hundred
a
year
your
school
bills
came
to
nearly
as
much
and
i
had
to
live
too
and
keep
you
in
the
holidays
i
did
what
i
thought
was
the
best
we
should
both
have
been
miserable
in
cheap
pensions
stinting
ourselves
of
everything
we
liked
the
money
has
made
us
happy
for
thirteen
years
claire
rose
from
her
seat
and
walked
over
to
the
window
the
road
into
which
she
looked
was
wide
and
handsome
lined
with
a
double
row
of
trees
the
sun
shone
on
the
high
white
houses
with
the
green
which
stood
with
the
pension
along
the
path
a
dog
was
dragging
a
the
gleaming
brass
cans
clanking
from
side
to
side
through
the
open
window
came
the
faint
indescribable
scent
which
distinguishes
a
continental
from
a
british
city
claire
stared
with
unseeing
eyes
her
heart
beating
with
heavy
thuds
she
conjured
up
the
image
of
a
man
face
a
strong
kindly
face
a
face
which
might
well
make
the
sunshine
of
some
woman
life
but
which
made
no
appeal
to
her
own
heart
she
set
her
lips
and
two
bright
spots
of
colour
showed
suddenly
in
her
cheeks
so
smooth
and
uneventful
had
been
her
life
that
this
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
found
herself
face
to
face
with
serious
difficulty
and
after
the
first
shock
of
realisation
her
spirit
rose
to
meet
it
she
straightened
her
shoulders
as
if
throwing
off
a
weight
and
her
heart
cried
valiantly
it
my
own
life
and
i
will
be
forced
there
must
be
some
other
way
it
for
me
to
find
it
suddenly
she
whirled
round
and
walked
back
to
her
mother
mother
if
you
knew
how
little
money
was
left
why
would
you
let
me
accept
miss
farnborough
offer
at
christmas
for
a
moment
mrs
gifford
face
expressed
nothing
but
bewilderment
then
comprehension
dawned
you
mean
the
from
london
what
was
it
she
suggested
that
you
should
go
to
her
as
a
teacher
it
was
only
a
suggestion
so
far
as
i
remember
she
made
no
definite
offer
oh
yes
she
did
she
said
that
she
had
everlasting
difficulty
with
her
french
mistresses
and
that
i
was
the
very
person
for
whom
been
looking
virtually
french
yet
really
english
in
temperament
she
made
me
a
definite
offer
of
a
hundred
and
ten
pounds
a
year
mrs
gifford
laughed
and
shrugged
her
graceful
shoulders
she
appeared
to
find
the
proposal
supremely
ridiculous
yet
when
people
were
without
money
the
only
sane
course
seemed
to
be
to
take
what
one
could
get
claire
felt
that
she
had
not
yet
mastered
the
situation
there
must
be
something
behind
which
she
had
still
to
grasp
well
never
mind
the
school
for
a
moment
mother
dear
tell
me
what
thought
of
doing
you
must
have
had
some
plan
in
your
head
all
these
years
while
the
money
was
dwindling
away
tell
me
your
scheme
then
we
can
compare
the
two
and
see
which
is
better
mrs
gifford
bent
her
head
over
the
table
and
scribbled
aimlessly
with
a
pen
in
which
there
was
no
ink
she
made
no
answer
in
words
yet
as
she
waited
the
blood
flamed
suddenly
over
claire
face
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
divined
what
was
in
her
mother
mind
i
expected
that
you
would
marry
i
have
done
my
best
to
educate
you
and
give
you
a
happy
youth
i
expected
that
you
would
accept
your
first
good
offer
and
look
after
that
was
what
a
french
mother
would
naturally
say
to
her
daughter
that
was
what
claire
gifford
believed
that
her
own
mother
was
saying
to
her
at
that
moment
and
the
accusation
brought
little
of
the
revolt
which
an
english
girl
would
have
experienced
claire
had
been
educated
at
a
parisian
boarding
school
and
during
the
last
three
years
had
associated
almost
entirely
with
andrees
and
maries
and
celestes
who
took
for
granted
that
their
husbands
should
be
chosen
for
them
by
their
parents
claire
had
assisted
at
betrothal
feasts
and
played
at
subsequent
weddings
and
had
witnessed
an
astonishing
degree
of
happiness
as
an
outcome
of
these
unions
at
this
moment
she
felt
no
anger
against
her
own
mother
for
having
tried
to
follow
a
similar
course
her
prevailing
sensation
was
annoyance
with
herself
for
having
been
so
difficult
to
lead
it
must
be
my
english
blood
somehow
when
it
came
to
the
point
i
never
but
mr
judge
is
different
from
most
men
he
is
so
good
and
generous
and
unmercenary
he
be
kind
to
mother
and
let
her
live
with
us
and
make
no
fuss
he
is
as
charming
to
her
as
he
is
to
me
oh
dear
i
selfish
i
a
wretch
it
is
as
if
i
were
in
love
with
anyone
else
i
not
perhaps
i
never
shall
be
i
never
have
the
chance
if
i
live
in
lodgings
and
spend
my
life
teaching
irregular
verbs
why
ca
i
be
sensible
and
french
and
marry
him
and
live
happily
ever
after
petite
why
ca
i
think
of
suddenly
claire
swooped
down
upon
her
mother
drooping
figure
wrapped
her
in
loving
arms
and
swung
her
gently
to
and
fro
she
was
a
tall
strikingly
graceful
girl
with
a
face
less
regularly
beautiful
than
her
mother
but
infinitely
more
piquant
and
attractive
she
was
more
plump
and
rounded
than
the
modern
english
girl
and
her
complexion
less
pink
and
white
but
she
was
very
neat
and
dainty
and
smart
possessed
grey
eyes
red
lips
which
curled
mischievously
upward
at
the
corner
and
a
pair
of
dimples
on
her
soft
left
cheek
the
dimples
were
in
full
play
at
this
moment
the
large
one
was
just
on
the
level
with
the
upward
curl
of
the
lips
the
smaller
one
nestled
close
to
its
side
in
repose
they
were
almost
unnoticed
but
at
the
slightest
lighting
of
expression
at
the
first
dawn
of
a
smile
they
danced
into
sight
and
became
the
most
noticeable
feature
of
her
face
claire
without
her
dimples
would
have
been
another
and
far
less
fascinating
personality
mother
darling
forgive
me
kiss
me
do
look
sad
i
had
a
good
time
and
we
have
a
good
time
yet
if
it
is
in
my
power
to
get
it
for
you
cheer
up
things
wo
be
as
bad
as
you
fear
we
wo
allow
them
to
be
bad
how
much
does
the
horrid
old
bank
say
that
we
owe
three
hundred
francs
i
can
pay
it
out
of
my
own
little
savings
does
it
mean
literally
that
there
is
nothing
more
nothing
at
all
not
a
single
sou
oh
no
i
have
some
shares
they
have
been
worthless
for
years
but
just
lately
they
have
gone
up
i
was
asking
mr
judge
about
them
yesterday
he
says
i
might
get
between
two
and
three
hundred
pounds
they
were
worth
a
thousand
years
ago
claire
brightened
with
the
quick
relief
of
youth
two
or
three
hundred
english
pounds
were
a
considerable
improvement
on
a
debit
account
with
two
or
three
hundred
pounds
much
might
yet
be
done
thousands
of
people
had
built
up
great
fortunes
on
smaller
foundations
in
a
vague
indefinite
fashion
she
determined
to
devote
these
last
pounds
to
settling
herself
in
some
business
which
would
ensure
a
speedy
and
generous
return
school
teaching
was
plainly
out
of
the
question
since
two
gentlewomen
could
not
exist
on
a
hundred
and
ten
pounds
a
year
she
must
think
of
something
quicker
more
lucrative
all
through
dinner
that
evening
claire
debated
her
future
vocation
as
she
sat
by
her
mother
side
halfway
down
the
long
which
to
english
eyes
appeared
so
bare
and
unattractive
but
which
was
yet
supplied
with
the
most
appetising
of
food
claire
eyes
were
accustomed
to
the
lack
of
pretty
detail
she
had
quite
an
affection
for
the
pension
which
stood
for
home
in
her
migratory
life
and
a
real
love
for
madame
dupre
the
cheery
kindly
most
capable
proprietor
such
of
the
as
were
not
purely
birds
of
passage
she
regarded
as
friends
rather
than
acquaintances
the
only
person
in
the
room
to
whom
she
felt
any
antagonism
was
mr
judge
himself
but
unfortunately
he
was
the
one
of
all
others
whom
she
was
expected
to
like
best
as
she
ate
her
salad
and
broke
fragments
of
delicious
crusty
roll
claire
threw
furtive
glances
across
the
table
at
the
man
who
for
the
last
weeks
had
exercised
so
disturbing
an
element
in
her
life
was
it
six
weeks
or
two
months
since
she
and
her
mother
had
first
made
his
acquaintance
at
the
tennis
club
at
which
they
spent
so
many
of
their
afternoons
claire
had
noticed
that
a
new
man
had
been
present
on
that
occasion
had
bestowed
on
him
one
critical
glance
decided
with
youthful
arrogance
oh
quite
old
and
promptly
forgotten
his
existence
until
an
hour
later
when
as
she
was
sitting
in
the
pavilion
enjoying
the
luxury
of
a
real
english
tea
the
strange
man
and
her
mother
had
entered
side
by
side
claire
summoned
in
imagination
the
picture
of
her
mother
as
she
had
looked
at
that
moment
slim
and
graceful
in
the
simplest
of
white
dresses
an
untrimmed
linen
hat
shading
her
charming
face
she
looked
about
and
claire
was
convinced
that
she
knew
as
much
and
that
it
was
a
mischievous
curiosity
to
see
her
surprise
which
prompted
her
to
lead
the
way
across
the
floor
and
formally
introduce
my
daughter
mr
judge
exhibited
all
the
expected
signs
of
bewilderment
but
he
made
himself
exceedingly
amiable
to
the
daughter
and
it
was
not
until
a
week
later
that
it
was
discovered
that
he
had
concluded
that
the
relationship
must
surely
be
step
when
fresh
explanations
were
made
and
all
the
bewilderment
came
over
again
since
then
oh
since
then
claire
told
herself
there
had
been
no
getting
away
from
the
man
he
was
it
appeared
an
indian
merchant
spending
a
few
months
on
the
continent
at
the
conclusion
of
a
leave
he
had
come
to
brussels
because
of
the
presence
of
an
old
school
friend
the
same
friend
who
was
responsible
for
the
introduction
at
the
tennis
club
but
week
after
week
passed
by
and
he
showed
no
disposition
to
move
on
now
brussels
is
a
very
gay
and
interesting
little
city
but
when
paris
looms
ahead
and
berlin
vienna
to
say
nothing
of
the
beauties
of
switzerland
and
the
tyrol
and
the
artistic
treasures
of
italy
well
it
seem
out
of
proportion
to
waste
six
whole
weeks
in
that
one
spot
at
the
end
of
the
last
fortnight
too
mr
judge
declared
that
he
was
sick
to
death
of
hotels
and
lonely
evenings
in
smoking
rooms
and
approached
madame
dupre
with
a
view
to
joining
the
party
at
villa
beau
sejour
madame
was
delighted
to
receive
him
but
claire
gifford
told
her
mother
resentfully
that
she
considered
mr
judge
behaviour
very
cool
how
did
he
know
that
it
would
be
pleasant
for
them
to
have
him
poking
about
morning
noon
and
night
it
is
pension
darling
and
he
is
very
nice
to
you
mrs
gifford
had
said
in
return
and
as
it
was
impossible
to
contradict
either
statement
claire
had
tossed
her
head
and
relapsed
into
silence
for
the
first
weeks
of
her
acquaintance
with
mr
judge
claire
had
thoroughly
enjoyed
his
attentions
it
was
agreeable
to
know
a
man
who
had
a
habit
of
noting
your
wishes
and
then
setting
to
work
to
bring
them
about
forthwith
and
who
was
also
delightfully
extravagant
as
regards
flowers
and
seemed
to
grow
chocolates
in
his
coat
pockets
it
was
only
when
he
spoke
of
moving
to
the
pension
and
her
girl
friends
at
the
tennis
club
began
to
tease
roll
meaning
eyes
and
ask
when
she
was
to
be
congratulated
that
she
took
fright
did
people
really
think
that
she
was
going
to
mr
judge
lately
things
had
moved
on
apace
and
as
a
result
of
the
unwelcome
revelations
of
the
morning
post
claire
was
asking
herself
a
different
question
she
was
no
longer
occupied
with
other
people
she
was
thinking
of
herself
am
i
going
to
marry
mr
judge
oh
good
gracious
is
that
sitting
over
there
and
have
i
got
to
live
with
him
every
day
as
long
as
we
both
shall
live
she
shuddered
at
the
thought
but
in
truth
there
was
nothing
to
shudder
at
in
robert
judge
appearance
he
was
a
man
of
forty
bronzed
and
wiry
with
agreeable
if
not
regular
features
round
his
eyes
the
skin
was
deeply
furrowed
but
the
eyes
themselves
were
bright
and
youthful
and
the
prevailing
expression
was
one
of
sincerity
and
kindliness
he
wore
a
loose
grey
tweed
suit
with
a
shirt
which
showed
a
length
of
brown
neck
the
fingers
of
his
right
band
were
deeply
stained
with
tobacco
during
he
carried
on
a
conversation
with
his
companion
in
exceedingly
bad
french
but
ever
and
anon
he
glanced
across
the
table
as
though
his
thoughts
were
not
on
his
words
once
on
looking
up
suddenly
claire
found
his
eyes
fixed
upon
herself
with
a
strained
anxious
look
and
her
heart
quickened
as
she
looked
then
sank
down
heavy
as
lead
it
coming
she
said
to
herself
it
coming
there
no
running
away
i
have
to
stay
and
see
it
out
oh
why
ca
i
be
french
and
sensible
i
ought
to
be
thankful
to
marry
such
a
kind
good
man
and
be
able
to
give
mother
a
comfortable
home
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
was
neither
glad
nor
thankful
despite
her
french
training
the
english
instinct
survived
and
clamoured
for
liberty
for
independence
it
my
own
life
if
i
marry
at
all
i
want
to
choose
the
man
for
no
other
reason
than
that
i
love
him
not
as
a
duty
and
to
please
somebody
else
then
she
glanced
at
her
mother
sitting
by
her
side
slim
and
graceful
with
the
little
air
of
pathos
and
helplessness
which
even
strangers
found
so
appealing
and
as
she
did
so
a
shiver
passed
through
claire
veins
but
i
have
to
do
it
she
said
to
herself
helplessly
i
have
to
do
it
chapter
two
too
successful
the
next
few
days
passed
by
slowly
enough
it
is
a
great
trial
for
a
young
creature
to
realise
that
a
change
is
inevitable
and
at
the
same
time
that
one
must
be
cautious
about
making
it
the
impulse
is
always
to
rush
into
action
and
it
is
difficult
to
sit
still
and
agree
with
the
elderly
precept
in
favour
of
consideration
and
delay
if
matters
had
been
left
to
claire
she
would
have
started
out
forthwith
to
search
for
a
cheap
pension
and
would
have
also
despatched
a
letter
to
miss
farnborough
by
the
first
post
to
inquire
if
the
school
post
were
still
open
but
her
mother
vetoed
both
proposals
and
pleaded
so
urgently
for
delay
that
there
was
nothing
left
but
to
agree
and
compose
herself
as
best
she
might
the
weather
was
too
hot
for
tennis
and
in
truth
claire
was
not
in
the
mood
for
games
with
every
hour
she
realised
more
keenly
that
she
had
come
to
the
parting
of
the
ways
and
in
the
prospect
of
a
new
life
old
interests
lost
their
savour
her
mother
seemed
to
share
her
restlessness
but
while
claire
preferred
to
stay
indoors
in
the
privacy
of
her
own
room
mrs
gifford
seemed
to
find
relief
in
action
and
was
often
out
for
hours
at
a
time
without
vouchsafing
any
explanation
of
her
absence
claire
was
not
curious
she
was
content
to
close
the
green
shutters
of
her
windows
slip
into
a
muslin
wrapper
and
employ
herself
at
some
simple
piece
of
needlework
which
kept
her
hands
busy
while
leaving
her
thoughts
free
where
would
she
be
this
time
next
year
it
was
a
question
which
no
mortal
can
answer
with
certainty
but
many
of
us
are
happy
in
the
probability
that
we
shall
be
still
living
in
the
same
dear
home
surrounded
by
the
people
and
the
objects
which
we
love
whereas
one
certainty
was
that
she
must
move
on
to
fresh
scenes
bombay
or
london
that
seemed
the
choice
ahead
matrimony
or
teaching
on
the
one
hand
a
luxurious
home
carriages
and
horses
a
staff
of
servants
and
apparently
as
much
society
as
one
desired
with
the
incubus
of
a
husband
whom
she
did
not
love
and
who
was
twenty
years
her
senior
on
the
other
hand
work
and
poverty
with
the
advantages
of
freedom
and
independence
claire
eyes
brightened
at
the
sound
of
those
two
words
for
dear
as
liberty
is
to
the
heart
of
an
englishwoman
it
was
in
prospect
dearer
still
to
this
girl
who
had
been
educated
in
a
country
still
enslaved
by
chaperonage
and
had
never
known
a
taste
of
real
freedom
of
action
mrs
gifford
had
been
as
strict
as
or
stricter
than
any
belgian
mother
being
rightly
determined
that
no
breath
of
scandal
should
touch
her
daughter
name
therefore
wherever
claire
went
some
responsible
female
went
with
her
she
was
chaperoned
to
church
chaperoned
on
her
morning
constitutional
a
chaperon
sat
on
guard
during
the
period
of
music
and
drawing
lessons
and
at
their
conclusion
escorted
her
back
to
the
pension
what
wonder
that
the
thought
of
life
as
a
bachelor
girl
in
london
seemed
full
of
a
thrilling
excitement
suppose
for
one
minute
that
she
decided
on
london
what
would
become
of
mother
again
and
again
claire
asked
herself
this
question
again
and
again
she
recalled
the
interview
between
herself
and
the
headmistress
miss
farnborough
when
the
subject
of
teaching
had
been
discussed
it
had
happened
one
morning
in
the
salon
of
the
pension
when
claire
had
been
coaching
an
english
visitor
in
preparation
for
a
french
interview
which
lay
ahead
and
miss
farnborough
laying
down
her
book
had
listened
with
smiling
interest
then
the
englishwoman
left
the
room
and
miss
farnborough
had
said
you
did
that
very
cleverly
very
cleverly
indeed
you
have
a
very
happy
knack
of
putting
things
simply
and
forcibly
i
noticed
it
more
than
once
have
you
ever
done
any
teaching
none
professionally
claire
had
replied
with
a
laugh
but
a
great
deal
by
chance
i
seem
to
drift
into
the
position
of
coach
to
most
of
the
english
visitors
here
it
pleases
them
and
it
interests
me
and
i
used
to
help
the
french
girls
with
their
english
at
school
then
miss
farnborough
had
inquired
with
interest
as
to
the
details
of
claire
education
the
schools
she
had
attended
the
examinations
she
had
passed
and
finally
had
come
the
critical
question
have
you
ever
thought
of
taking
up
teaching
as
a
profession
claire
had
never
thought
of
taking
up
work
of
any
kind
but
the
suggestion
roused
a
keen
interest
as
one
of
the
temporary
tight
times
was
in
process
so
that
the
prospect
of
seemed
particularly
agreeable
she
discussed
the
subject
carefully
and
out
of
that
discussion
had
arisen
the
final
offer
of
a
post
the
junior
french
mistress
in
the
high
school
of
which
miss
farnborough
was
head
was
leaving
at
midsummer
if
claire
wished
she
could
take
her
place
at
a
salary
beginning
at
a
hundred
and
ten
pounds
a
year
in
trust
schools
of
which
saint
cuthbert
was
one
there
was
no
fixed
scale
of
advancement
but
a
successful
teacher
could
reach
a
salary
of
say
two
hundred
a
year
by
the
time
she
was
or
forty
as
against
the
permanent
sixty
or
seventy
offered
to
mistresses
in
residential
schools
of
a
higher
grade
miss
farnborough
mistresses
were
women
trained
at
the
various
universities
the
school
itself
was
situated
in
a
fashionable
neighbourhood
and
its
pupils
were
for
the
most
part
daughters
of
professional
men
and
gentlefolk
of
moderate
incomes
there
was
no
pension
scheme
and
mistresses
had
to
live
out
but
with
care
and
economy
they
could
take
out
some
insurance
to
provide
for
old
age
claire
took
little
interest
in
her
own
old
age
which
seemed
too
far
away
to
count
but
she
was
intensely
interested
in
the
immediate
future
and
had
been
hurt
and
annoyed
when
her
mother
had
waved
aside
the
proposal
as
unworthy
of
serious
consideration
and
now
only
three
months
after
miss
farnborough
departure
the
crisis
had
arisen
and
that
hundred
and
ten
pounds
assumed
a
vastly
increased
value
supposing
that
the
post
was
accepted
and
mother
and
daughter
started
life
in
london
with
a
capital
of
between
two
and
three
hundred
pounds
and
a
salary
of
one
hundred
and
ten
as
regular
income
how
long
would
the
last
out
judging
from
the
experience
of
past
years
a
very
short
time
indeed
and
what
would
happen
after
that
claire
had
read
gruesome
tales
of
the
struggles
of
women
in
like
positions
overtaken
by
illness
losing
the
salaries
which
represented
their
all
brought
face
to
face
with
actual
starvation
and
in
the
midst
of
the
midsummer
heat
little
shivers
of
fear
trickled
up
and
down
her
spine
as
she
realised
how
easily
she
and
her
mother
might
drift
into
a
like
position
then
on
the
other
hand
bombay
indian
houses
were
large
mother
could
have
her
own
rooms
in
the
hot
weather
they
would
go
together
to
the
hills
leaving
mr
judge
behind
how
long
did
the
hot
season
last
four
or
five
months
nearly
half
the
year
perhaps
it
would
be
only
half
as
bad
as
marrying
a
man
for
money
in
europe
for
you
would
get
rid
of
him
all
that
time
claire
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
laughed
and
two
minutes
later
whisked
away
a
tear
dedicated
to
the
memory
of
girlish
dreams
useless
to
dream
any
longer
she
was
awake
now
and
must
face
life
in
a
sensible
manner
her
duty
was
to
marry
robert
judge
and
to
make
a
home
for
her
mother
another
girl
might
have
cherished
anger
against
the
recklessness
which
had
landed
her
in
such
a
trap
but
after
the
first
shock
of
discovery
there
had
been
no
resentment
in
claire
heart
she
implicitly
believed
her
mother
assurance
that
according
to
her
light
she
had
acted
for
the
best
and
echoed
with
heartiness
the
assertion
that
the
money
had
provided
a
good
time
for
thirteen
long
years
they
had
not
been
rich
but
there
had
been
a
feeling
of
sufficiency
they
had
had
comfortable
quarters
pretty
clothes
delightful
holiday
journeys
a
reasonable
amount
of
gaiety
and
over
and
beyond
all
the
advantages
of
an
excellent
education
claire
happy
nature
remembered
her
benefits
and
made
short
work
of
the
rest
poor
beautiful
mother
who
could
expect
her
to
be
prudent
and
careful
like
any
ordinary
prosaic
woman
even
as
the
thought
passed
through
the
girl
mind
the
door
of
the
bedroom
opened
and
mrs
gifford
appeared
on
the
threshold
she
wore
a
large
shady
hat
and
in
the
dim
light
of
the
room
her
face
was
not
clearly
visible
but
there
was
a
tone
in
her
voice
which
aroused
claire
instant
curiosity
mother
was
trying
to
speak
in
her
ordinary
voice
but
she
was
nervous
she
was
agitated
she
was
not
feeling
ordinary
at
all
claire
we
are
going
to
the
forest
to
have
tea
it
is
impossibly
hot
indoors
but
it
will
be
delightful
under
the
trees
mr
judge
has
sent
for
a
and
miss
benson
has
asked
to
come
too
put
on
your
blue
muslin
and
your
big
hat
be
quick
darling
fasten
you
up
i
rather
not
go
thank
you
mother
i
quite
happy
here
trouble
about
me
mrs
gifford
was
obviously
discomposed
she
hesitated
frowned
walked
restlessly
up
and
down
then
spoke
again
with
an
added
note
of
insistence
but
i
want
you
to
come
claire
i
not
troubled
you
before
because
i
saw
you
wanted
to
be
alone
but
it
ca
go
on
mr
judge
wants
you
to
come
he
suggested
the
drive
because
he
thought
it
would
tempt
you
if
you
refuse
he
will
ask
you
again
i
think
dear
you
ought
to
come
claire
was
silent
she
felt
sick
and
faint
all
over
her
body
little
pulses
seemed
to
be
whizzing
like
so
many
alarm
clocks
all
crying
in
insistent
voices
time
up
time
up
no
more
lazing
up
with
you
and
do
your
duty
her
forehead
felt
very
damp
and
her
throat
felt
very
dry
and
she
heard
a
sharp
disagreeable
voice
saying
curtly
oh
certainly
i
will
come
no
need
to
make
a
fuss
i
can
dress
myself
thank
you
i
come
down
when
i
ready
mrs
gifford
turned
without
a
word
and
went
out
of
the
room
but
claire
was
too
busy
being
sorry
for
herself
to
have
sympathy
to
spare
for
anyone
else
she
threw
off
her
wrapper
and
slipped
into
the
cool
muslin
dress
which
was
at
once
so
simple
and
so
essentially
french
and
date
and
then
throwing
open
the
door
of
a
cupboard
stared
at
a
long
row
of
hats
ranged
on
a
top
shelf
and
deliberately
selected
the
one
which
she
considered
the
least
becoming
i
will
be
decked
up
for
the
sacrifice
she
muttered
rebelliously
then
bent
forward
so
that
her
face
approached
close
to
the
flushed
frowning
reflection
in
the
glass
you
are
going
to
be
proposed
to
my
dear
she
said
scornfully
you
are
going
to
be
good
and
sensible
and
say
please
when
you
see
yourself
next
you
will
be
engaged
it
wo
be
dear
little
claire
gifford
any
more
it
will
be
the
horrible
future
mrs
robert
judge
she
stuck
through
the
straw
hat
with
savage
energy
for
once
in
her
life
noticed
with
distinct
satisfaction
that
it
was
secured
at
an
unbecoming
angle
then
hearing
through
the
the
sound
of
approaching
wheels
marched
resolutely
forth
to
meet
her
fate
in
the
mrs
gifford
and
miss
benson
took
the
seats
of
honour
leaving
claire
and
mr
judge
to
sit
side
by
side
and
the
one
furtive
glance
which
she
cast
in
his
direction
showed
him
looking
confident
and
unperturbed
just
like
a
french
already
assured
by
maman
that
mademoiselle
was
meekly
waiting
to
assent
to
his
suit
he
might
at
least
pay
me
the
compliment
of
it
is
dreadfully
dull
to
be
taken
for
granted
reflected
claire
in
disgust
the
next
hour
was
a
horrible
experience
everything
happened
exactly
as
claire
had
known
it
would
from
the
moment
the
quartette
set
forth
arrived
at
the
forest
they
took
possession
of
one
of
the
little
tables
beneath
the
trees
and
made
fitful
conversation
the
while
they
consumed
delicious
cakes
and
execrable
tea
then
the
meal
being
finished
mrs
gifford
and
her
companion
announced
a
wish
to
sit
still
and
rest
while
mr
judge
nervously
invited
miss
claire
to
accompany
him
in
a
walk
she
assented
of
course
what
was
the
use
of
putting
it
off
and
as
soon
as
they
were
well
started
he
spied
another
seat
and
insisted
upon
sitting
down
once
more
now
he
begin
thought
claire
desperately
he
talk
about
india
and
being
lonely
and
say
how
happy
he
has
felt
since
he
been
here
and
even
as
the
thought
passed
through
her
mind
mr
judge
began
to
speak
awfully
jolly
old
forest
this
is
awfully
nice
place
brussels
altogether
nicest
place
in
the
world
never
been
so
happy
in
my
life
as
i
been
the
last
month
of
course
naturally
you
must
realise
that
when
a
fellow
hangs
on
week
after
week
there
er
there
must
be
some
special
attraction
not
that
it
is
a
rattling
old
city
and
all
that
mr
judge
was
growing
a
little
mixed
his
voice
sounded
flurried
and
nervous
but
claire
was
not
in
the
least
inclined
to
help
him
she
sat
rigid
as
a
poker
staring
stolidly
ahead
there
was
not
the
ghost
of
a
dimple
in
her
soft
pink
cheeks
i
er
your
mother
tells
me
that
she
has
said
nothing
to
you
but
she
is
sure
all
the
same
that
you
suspect
i
asked
her
to
let
me
speak
to
you
naturally
she
feels
the
difficulty
she
is
devoted
to
you
you
know
that
of
course
i
have
told
her
that
i
will
make
your
happiness
my
special
charge
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
i
would
not
do
to
ensure
it
you
know
that
too
do
you
claire
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
touched
her
tentatively
on
the
arm
but
claire
drew
herself
back
with
a
prickly
dignity
if
he
wanted
to
propose
at
all
he
must
propose
properly
she
was
not
going
to
commit
herself
in
response
to
an
insinuation
you
are
very
kind
i
am
quite
happy
as
i
am
er
yes
yes
of
course
but
but
things
do
go
on
you
know
go
on
always
without
a
change
mr
judge
took
off
his
straw
hat
twirled
it
nervously
to
and
fro
and
laid
it
down
on
the
bench
by
his
side
claire
casting
a
quick
glance
noticed
that
his
hair
was
growing
noticeably
thin
on
the
temples
and
felt
an
additional
sinking
of
spirits
claire
cried
the
man
desperately
do
let
us
beat
about
the
bush
i
not
used
to
this
sort
of
thing
do
make
it
harder
than
you
need
you
noticed
have
you
you
know
what
i
want
to
tell
you
claire
nodded
dumbly
in
the
case
of
previous
belgian
admirers
affairs
had
been
checked
before
they
reached
the
extreme
stage
and
she
found
this
her
first
spoken
proposal
much
less
exciting
than
she
had
expected
as
a
friend
pure
and
simple
she
had
thoroughly
liked
mr
judge
and
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
there
lived
a
lingering
hope
that
perhaps
if
he
loved
her
very
much
and
expressed
his
devotion
in
very
eloquent
words
her
heart
might
soften
in
response
but
so
far
he
had
not
even
mentioned
love
she
was
silent
for
several
minutes
and
when
she
did
speak
it
was
to
ask
a
side
question
is
mother
willing
to
go
to
india
she
was
looking
at
the
man
as
she
spoke
and
the
change
which
passed
over
his
face
startled
her
by
its
intensity
his
eyes
shone
the
rugged
features
were
transfigured
by
a
very
radiance
of
joy
he
looked
young
at
that
moment
young
and
handsome
and
blissfully
content
claire
stared
at
him
in
amazement
not
unmingled
with
irritation
even
if
mother
willing
her
own
consent
had
still
to
be
obtained
it
was
tactless
to
make
so
sure
her
own
face
looked
decidedly
sulky
as
she
twitched
round
on
her
seat
and
resumed
her
stolid
staring
into
space
again
there
was
silence
till
a
hand
stretched
out
to
clasp
her
arm
and
a
voice
spoke
in
deep
appealing
accents
claire
dear
child
you
are
young
you
have
never
known
loneliness
or
disappointment
we
have
happiness
is
fifty
times
more
precious
when
it
comes
to
those
who
have
suffered
you
would
not
be
cruel
enough
to
damp
our
happiness
you
do
it
you
know
if
you
persist
in
an
attitude
of
coldness
and
disapproval
i
do
say
you
can
destroy
it
thank
god
it
goes
too
deep
for
anyone
to
be
able
to
do
that
but
you
can
rub
off
the
bloom
do
do
it
claire
be
generous
be
yourself
wish
us
good
luck
wish
good
luck
what
oh
what
are
you
talking
about
claire
was
gasping
now
quivering
with
a
frenzy
of
excitement
robert
judge
stared
in
return
his
face
full
of
an
honest
bewilderment
of
our
engagement
of
course
your
mother
engagement
to
me
i
have
been
talking
about
it
all
the
time
then
claire
threw
up
both
her
hands
and
burst
into
a
wild
peal
of
laughter
peal
after
peal
rang
out
into
the
air
she
rocked
to
and
fro
on
her
seat
her
eyes
disappeared
from
view
her
teeth
shone
her
little
feet
in
their
dainty
french
shoes
danced
upon
the
ground
she
laughed
till
the
tears
poured
down
her
cheeks
and
her
gloved
hands
pressed
against
her
side
where
a
stitch
was
uncomfortably
making
itself
felt
stout
belgian
couples
passing
past
the
end
of
the
avenue
looked
on
with
indulgent
smiles
a
little
shocked
at
so
much
demonstration
in
public
but
relieved
to
perceive
that
could
laugh
with
such
monsieur
they
observed
looked
not
sympathetic
monsieur
had
an
air
injured
annoyed
on
his
dignity
on
his
cheeks
was
a
flush
as
of
wounded
pride
when
at
length
the
paroxysm
showed
signs
of
lessening
he
spoke
in
cold
stilted
tones
you
appear
to
find
it
ridiculous
it
seems
to
amuse
you
very
much
i
may
say
that
to
us
it
is
a
serious
matter
oh
no
you
do
understand
you
understand
gasped
claire
feebly
i
am
not
laughing
at
you
i
laughing
at
myself
oh
mr
judge
you
never
guess
it
too
screamingly
funny
for
words
i
thought
all
this
time
from
the
very
beginning
i
thought
it
was
you
thought
it
was
you
thought
i
wanted
that
i
was
talking
of
that
i
meant
to
propose
to
yes
yes
yes
me
me
me
of
course
i
did
i
been
thinking
it
for
weeks
everyone
thought
so
they
teased
me
to
death
you
were
attentive
to
me
you
know
you
were
you
were
always
giving
me
things
well
of
course
poor
mr
judge
defended
himself
with
honest
indignation
what
else
could
i
do
i
could
not
give
them
to
and
i
wanted
naturally
i
wanted
to
get
you
on
my
side
you
were
the
difficulty
i
knew
that
if
she
had
only
herself
to
consider
i
could
win
her
round
but
if
you
ranged
yourself
against
me
it
would
be
a
hard
fight
naturally
i
tried
to
ingratiate
myself
it
appears
that
i
have
rather
overdone
the
part
but
i
ca
flatter
myself
his
eyes
twinkled
mischievously
that
i
been
too
successful
you
do
appear
exactly
overcome
with
disappointment
they
laughed
together
but
only
for
a
moment
then
he
was
serious
again
appealing
to
her
in
earnest
tones
you
wo
range
yourself
against
me
claire
you
wo
dissuade
i
love
her
very
dearly
and
i
know
i
can
make
her
happy
you
wo
make
it
hard
for
us
indeed
i
wo
why
should
i
claire
cried
heartily
i
only
too
thankful
mother
needs
someone
to
look
after
her
and
i
sooner
you
did
it
than
anyone
else
i
like
you
awfully
always
did
until
i
began
to
be
afraid
i
did
want
to
marry
you
myself
but
if
mother
does
i
think
it
a
splendid
thing
thank
you
dear
thank
you
a
thousand
times
that
a
relief
robert
judge
stretched
himself
with
a
deep
breath
of
satisfaction
then
he
grew
confidential
reviewing
the
past
with
true
enjoyment
i
fell
in
love
with
her
that
first
afternoon
at
the
tennis
club
thought
bridges
introduced
her
as
miss
gifford
put
her
down
at
five
and
hoped
she
would
think
me
a
hopeless
old
fogey
never
had
such
a
surprise
in
my
life
as
when
she
introduced
you
thought
for
a
time
i
should
have
to
give
it
up
then
she
asked
my
advice
on
one
or
two
business
matters
and
i
discovered
he
hesitated
flushing
uncomfortably
and
claire
finished
the
sentence
that
we
are
coming
to
the
end
of
our
resources
mr
judge
nodded
and
so
of
course
he
continued
simply
that
settled
it
i
go
away
and
leave
her
to
face
a
struggle
i
was
jolly
thankful
to
feel
that
i
had
met
her
in
time
i
think
you
are
a
dear
good
man
i
think
mother
is
very
lucky
thank
you
so
much
for
being
my
cried
claire
her
grey
eyes
softening
with
a
charming
friendliness
as
they
dwelt
on
the
man
honest
face
and
he
took
her
hand
in
his
and
squeezed
it
with
affectionate
ardour
thank
you
my
dear
thank
i
shall
be
jolly
proud
of
having
such
a
pretty
daughter
i
not
a
rich
man
but
i
am
comfortably
off
and
i
do
my
best
to
give
you
a
good
time
your
mother
feels
sure
she
will
enjoy
the
indian
life
most
girls
think
it
great
fun
and
of
course
i
have
lots
of
friends
claire
stared
at
him
a
new
seriousness
dawning
in
her
eyes
she
looked
very
pretty
and
very
young
and
not
a
little
pathetic
into
the
bargain
for
the
first
time
since
the
realisation
of
her
mistake
the
personal
application
of
the
situation
burst
upon
her
and
a
chill
crept
through
her
veins
if
she
herself
had
married
robert
judge
her
mother
would
have
made
her
home
with
them
as
a
matter
of
course
but
it
was
by
no
means
a
matter
of
course
that
she
should
make
her
home
with
her
mother
she
stared
into
the
honest
face
of
the
man
before
her
the
man
who
was
not
rich
the
man
who
was
in
love
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
a
smile
twisted
the
corner
of
her
lips
mr
judge
if
i
ask
you
a
question
will
you
promise
to
give
me
an
absolutely
honest
answer
yes
i
will
well
then
will
you
having
a
third
person
living
with
you
all
the
time
up
to
the
man
forehead
rushed
the
treacherous
blood
he
frowned
he
scowled
he
opened
his
lips
to
protest
but
that
flush
had
answered
for
him
and
claire
refused
to
listen
no
no
do
of
course
you
would
who
would
in
your
place
poor
darlings
i
quite
understand
you
you
know
though
you
feel
about
nineteen
and
mother
is
prettier
and
more
charming
than
half
the
girl
brides
and
you
will
want
to
be
just
as
young
and
foolish
as
you
like
not
to
be
to
be
sensible
because
a
daughter
is
there
all
the
time
staring
at
you
with
big
eyes
i
should
be
in
the
way
and
i
should
in
the
way
and
mr
judge
interrupted
in
an
urgent
voice
look
here
claire
i
do
think
you
ought
to
corner
me
like
this
it
not
fair
i
told
you
that
i
am
prepared
to
do
everything
for
your
happiness
you
ought
surely
to
realise
that
i
and
ought
to
realise
that
i
claire
broke
off
suddenly
and
held
out
her
hand
with
a
charming
smile
oh
but
there
plenty
of
time
we
can
arrange
all
that
later
on
let
go
and
find
mother
and
put
her
out
of
her
misery
she
will
be
longing
to
see
us
come
back
they
walked
down
the
avenue
together
and
as
they
went
claire
turned
her
head
from
side
to
side
taking
in
the
scene
with
wistful
intensity
how
many
times
would
she
see
it
again
as
she
had
said
many
discussions
would
certainly
take
place
as
to
her
future
destination
but
she
knew
in
her
heart
that
the
result
was
sure
providence
had
decided
or
her
the
future
was
london
and
work
chapter
three
gifford
is
married
claire
lost
no
time
in
writing
to
miss
farnborough
to
apply
for
the
post
of
french
mistress
if
it
were
still
vacant
and
by
return
of
post
received
a
cordial
reply
several
applications
had
been
received
but
no
appointment
had
been
made
and
the
head
was
pleased
to
confirm
her
previous
offer
of
a
commencing
salary
of
a
hundred
and
ten
pounds
and
would
expect
miss
gifford
to
take
up
her
duties
at
the
beginning
of
the
autumn
term
she
congratulated
her
on
her
decision
and
felt
sure
she
would
never
regret
devoting
her
life
to
so
interesting
and
valuable
a
work
instead
of
being
content
to
waste
it
in
the
pursuit
of
idle
pleasure
poor
claire
looked
a
little
dubious
as
she
read
those
last
words
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
does
not
as
a
rule
begin
to
pall
at
and
the
old
life
looked
very
sweet
and
pleasant
viewed
from
the
new
standpoint
of
change
she
put
on
a
bright
face
however
and
sternly
repressed
all
signs
of
depression
in
discussing
the
matter
with
her
mother
and
mr
judge
her
determination
evoked
the
expected
opposition
but
slowly
and
surely
the
opposition
decreased
and
her
arguments
were
listened
to
with
increasing
respect
the
lovers
were
sincerely
desirous
of
securing
the
girl
happiness
but
though
they
were
they
were
deeply
in
love
and
felt
a
natural
desire
to
begin
their
married
life
without
the
presence
of
a
third
person
however
dear
that
person
might
be
mr
judge
applauded
claire
spirit
and
prophesied
her
rapid
success
as
a
teacher
mrs
gifford
murmured
sweetly
and
if
you
like
it
dear
you
can
always
come
out
by
the
next
boat
try
it
for
a
year
it
will
be
quite
an
amusing
experience
to
live
the
life
of
a
bachelor
girl
and
of
course
in
a
year
or
two
we
be
coming
home
then
you
must
spend
the
whole
leave
with
us
we
see
wo
we
we
wo
make
any
plans
but
just
be
guided
by
circumstances
if
you
want
somewhere
to
go
in
the
holidays
there
my
old
aunt
mary
in
preston
but
you
be
bored
to
sobs
darling
no
doubt
miss
farnborough
will
introduce
you
to
lots
of
nice
people
in
london
and
you
will
have
all
the
fifteen
other
mistresses
to
take
you
about
i
expect
you
be
quite
gay
claire
darling
you
have
gold
tissue
under
this
ninon
or
just
a
handsome
lace
for
the
next
few
weeks
things
moved
quickly
in
answer
to
inquiries
about
lodgings
miss
farnborough
wrote
a
second
time
to
say
that
miss
rhodes
the
english
mistress
had
comfortable
rooms
which
she
was
sharing
with
the
present
french
teacher
she
was
willing
to
continue
the
arrangement
and
as
a
stranger
in
town
claire
would
doubtless
find
it
agreeable
as
well
as
economical
the
letter
was
entirely
like
and
formal
and
as
such
a
trifle
chilling
to
claire
for
miss
farnborough
had
been
so
warm
in
her
spoken
invitation
that
claire
had
expected
a
more
cordial
welcome
could
it
be
that
the
shadow
of
officialdom
was
already
making
itself
felt
the
next
few
weeks
were
given
up
to
and
farewell
visits
and
no
girl
could
have
shown
a
livelier
interest
in
the
selection
of
pretty
things
than
did
this
bride
of
claire
came
in
for
a
charming
costume
to
wear
at
the
wedding
and
for
the
rest
what
fitted
her
mother
fitted
herself
and
as
mrs
gifford
said
sweetly
it
would
be
a
sin
to
waste
all
my
nice
things
but
they
quite
unsuitable
for
india
just
use
them
out
darling
for
a
month
or
two
and
then
get
what
you
need
an
arrangement
which
seemed
sensible
enough
if
one
could
only
be
sure
of
money
to
supply
that
need
when
it
arose
the
day
before
her
marriage
mrs
gifford
thrust
an
envelope
into
her
daughter
hand
blushing
the
while
with
an
expression
of
real
distress
i
so
sorry
darling
that
it
so
little
i
tried
to
be
careful
but
the
money
has
flown
going
out
to
india
one
needs
so
many
clothes
and
there
were
quite
a
number
of
bills
i
send
more
by
and
by
and
remember
always
to
say
if
you
run
short
i
want
you
to
have
plenty
for
all
you
need
with
what
you
have
this
will
see
you
nicely
through
your
first
term
and
after
that
you
be
quite
rich
claire
kissed
her
and
was
careful
not
to
look
at
the
cheque
until
she
was
alone
she
had
counted
on
at
least
a
hundred
to
put
in
the
bank
as
a
refuge
against
a
rainy
day
surely
at
this
parting
of
the
ways
mother
would
wish
her
to
have
this
security
but
when
she
looked
at
her
cheque
it
was
to
discover
that
it
was
made
out
for
fifty
pounds
only
half
that
sum
claire
felt
sore
at
that
moment
and
for
the
first
time
a
chill
of
fear
entered
into
her
anticipations
fifty
pounds
seemed
a
dreadfully
small
sum
to
stand
between
herself
and
want
a
hundred
might
be
only
twice
its
value
but
its
three
figures
sounded
so
much
more
substantial
she
struggled
hard
to
allow
no
signs
of
resentment
to
be
seen
and
felt
that
virtue
was
rewarded
when
late
that
evening
mr
judge
presented
her
with
yet
another
envelope
saying
awkwardly
that
er
that
the
bridesmaid
present
thought
you
like
to
choose
for
yourself
something
to
do
you
know
some
fine
to
go
out
and
look
in
the
shops
i
no
views
do
get
jewellery
unless
you
wish
just
er
it
your
own
way
claire
kissed
him
and
remarked
that
he
was
a
sweet
old
dear
and
this
time
the
opening
of
the
envelope
brought
a
surprise
of
an
agreeable
nature
for
this
cheque
also
was
for
fifty
pounds
so
that
the
desired
hundred
was
really
in
her
possession
no
jewellery
for
her
into
the
bank
the
money
should
go
every
penny
of
it
and
her
bridesmaid
present
should
be
represented
by
peace
of
mind
which
after
the
financial
shock
of
the
last
month
seemed
more
precious
than
many
rubies
mr
and
mrs
judge
were
married
at
the
embassy
and
afterwards
at
an
english
church
the
bride
looking
her
most
charming
self
in
a
costume
of
diaphanous
chiffon
and
lace
and
the
most
fascinating
of
french
hats
and
the
bridegroom
his
worst
in
his
stiff
conventional
garments
they
were
a
very
radiant
couple
however
and
the
held
after
the
ceremony
at
the
hotel
britannique
was
a
cheerful
occasion
despite
the
parting
which
lay
ahead
the
gathering
was
quite
a
large
one
for
mr
judge
had
insisted
upon
inviting
all
the
friends
who
had
been
kind
to
his
and
her
daughter
during
their
three
years
sojourn
in
the
city
while
the
at
villa
beau
sejour
came
headed
by
madame
herself
in
a
new
black
silk
costume
her
white
transformation
elaborately
waved
and
curled
for
the
occasion
there
were
speeches
and
there
were
toasts
there
were
kindly
words
of
farewell
and
cheerful
anticipations
of
future
meetings
there
were
good
wishes
for
the
bride
and
bridegroom
and
more
good
wishes
for
the
bridesmaid
and
many
protestations
that
it
was
her
turn
next
then
the
bride
retired
to
change
her
dress
claire
went
with
her
and
tried
valiantly
not
to
cry
as
she
fastened
buttons
and
hooks
and
realised
how
long
it
might
be
before
she
next
waited
on
her
mother
mrs
judge
was
tearful
too
and
the
two
knew
a
bitter
moment
as
they
clung
together
for
the
real
farewell
before
rejoining
the
guests
i
been
careless
i
made
a
mess
of
things
i
not
been
half
as
thoughtful
as
i
should
have
been
sobbed
the
bride
but
i
loved
you
claire
and
this
will
make
no
difference
i
shall
love
you
just
the
same
claire
flushed
and
nodded
but
could
not
trust
herself
to
speak
the
love
of
a
mother
in
india
could
never
be
the
same
as
the
love
of
the
dear
companion
of
every
day
but
she
was
too
generous
to
add
to
her
mother
distress
by
refusing
to
be
comforted
and
the
bride
nervously
powdered
her
eyes
and
her
veil
before
descending
to
the
hall
anxious
as
ever
to
shelve
a
painful
subject
and
turn
her
face
to
the
sun
five
minutes
later
mr
and
mrs
judge
drove
away
from
the
door
and
the
girl
who
was
left
behind
turned
slowly
to
the
hotel
it
was
very
big
and
fine
and
spacious
but
at
that
moment
it
was
a
type
of
desolation
in
claire
eyes
with
a
sickening
wave
of
loneliness
she
realised
that
she
was
motherless
and
alone
chapter
four
a
fellow
traveller
introduces
herself
the
next
afternoon
claire
started
on
her
journey
to
london
she
had
spent
the
night
with
friends
and
been
seen
off
at
the
station
by
quite
a
crowd
of
little
souvenirs
had
been
showered
upon
her
all
the
morning
and
everyone
had
a
kindly
word
and
a
hopeful
prophecy
of
the
future
there
were
invitations
also
and
promises
to
look
her
up
in
her
london
home
and
a
perfect
shower
of
violets
thrown
into
the
carriage
as
the
train
steamed
out
of
the
station
and
claire
laughed
and
waved
her
hand
and
looked
so
complacent
and
beaming
that
no
one
looking
on
could
have
guessed
the
real
nature
of
her
journey
she
was
not
pretending
to
be
cheerful
she
cheerful
for
the
dreaded
parting
once
over
her
optimistic
nature
had
asserted
itself
and
painted
the
life
ahead
in
its
old
rosy
colours
mother
was
happy
and
secured
from
want
she
herself
was
about
to
enjoy
a
taste
for
independence
then
why
grumble
asked
claire
sensibly
of
herself
and
anything
less
grumbling
than
her
appearance
at
that
moment
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
she
was
beautifully
dressed
in
the
simplest
but
most
becoming
of
travelling
costumes
she
was
agreeably
conscious
that
the
onlookers
to
her
had
been
unanimously
admiring
in
their
regard
and
as
she
stood
arranging
her
bags
on
the
rack
overhead
she
saw
her
own
face
in
the
strip
of
mirror
and
agreed
in
their
verdict
i
glad
i
pretty
it
a
comfort
to
be
pretty
i
should
grow
so
tired
of
being
with
myself
if
i
were
plain
she
reflected
complacently
as
she
settled
herself
in
her
corner
and
flicked
a
few
grains
of
dust
from
the
front
of
her
skirt
she
had
taken
a
through
ticket
from
sheer
force
of
habit
for
mrs
gifford
had
always
travelled
first
and
the
ways
of
economy
take
some
time
to
acquire
in
the
opposite
corner
of
the
carriage
sat
an
elderly
woman
obviously
english
obviously
also
of
the
species
with
aquiline
features
white
hair
dressed
pompadour
fashion
and
an
expression
compounded
of
indifference
and
quizzical
good
humour
the
good
humour
was
in
the
ascendant
as
she
watched
the
kindly
belgians
crowd
round
her
envelop
her
in
their
arms
murmur
tearful
farewells
and
kiss
her
soundly
on
either
cheek
the
finely
marked
eyebrows
lifted
themselves
as
if
in
commiseration
for
the
victim
and
as
the
door
closed
on
the
last
farewell
she
heaved
an
involuntary
sigh
of
relief
it
was
evident
that
the
scene
appealed
to
her
entirely
from
the
one
standpoint
she
saw
nothing
touching
about
it
nothing
pathetic
she
was
simply
amused
and
carelessly
scornful
of
eccentricities
in
manner
or
appearance
on
the
seat
beside
this
imposing
personage
sat
a
young
woman
in
black
bearing
the
hall
mark
of
lady
maid
written
all
over
her
in
capital
letters
she
sat
stiffly
in
her
seat
one
gloved
hand
on
her
knee
the
other
clasped
tightly
round
the
handle
of
a
crocodile
claire
felt
a
passing
interest
in
the
pair
reflected
that
if
it
were
her
lot
in
life
to
be
a
maid
she
would
choose
to
live
on
the
continent
where
an
affectionate
intimacy
takes
the
place
of
this
frigid
separation
and
then
being
young
and
promptly
forgot
all
about
them
and
fell
to
building
castles
in
the
air
in
which
she
herself
lived
in
every
circumstance
of
affluence
and
plenty
beloved
and
admired
of
all
there
was
naturally
a
prince
in
the
story
a
veritable
prince
charming
who
was
all
that
the
most
exacting
mind
could
desire
but
the
image
was
vague
claire
heart
had
not
yet
been
touched
she
was
still
in
ignorance
as
to
what
manner
of
man
she
desired
engaged
in
these
pleasant
antwerp
was
reached
before
claire
realised
that
half
the
distance
was
covered
on
the
quay
the
wind
blew
chill
on
the
boat
itself
it
blew
chillier
still
claire
became
aware
that
she
was
in
for
a
stormy
crossing
but
was
little
perturbed
by
the
fact
since
she
knew
herself
to
be
an
unusually
good
sailor
she
tipped
the
stewardess
to
fill
a
hot
bottle
put
on
a
cosy
and
lay
down
in
her
berth
quite
ready
for
sleep
after
the
fatigue
and
excitement
of
the
past
week
in
five
minutes
the
ship
and
all
that
was
in
it
was
lost
in
dreams
and
so
far
as
claire
was
concerned
it
might
have
been
but
another
five
minutes
before
the
stewardess
aroused
her
to
announce
the
arrival
at
parkeston
pier
the
first
glance
around
proved
however
that
the
other
passengers
had
found
the
time
all
too
long
the
signs
of
a
bad
crossing
were
written
large
on
the
faces
of
her
companions
and
there
was
a
trace
of
resentment
in
the
manner
in
which
they
surveyed
her
active
movements
an
old
lady
in
a
bunk
immediately
opposite
her
own
seemed
especially
injured
and
did
not
hesitate
to
put
her
feelings
into
words
have
had
a
good
enough
night
i
believe
you
slept
right
through
are
you
aware
that
the
rest
of
us
have
been
more
ill
than
we
ever
been
in
our
lives
she
asked
in
accusing
tones
and
claire
laughed
her
happy
gurgling
little
laugh
and
said
i
sorry
but
it
all
over
is
it
and
people
always
say
that
they
feel
better
afterwards
the
old
lady
grunted
she
certainly
looked
thoroughly
ill
and
wretched
at
the
moment
her
face
drawn
and
yellow
beneath
her
scanty
locks
and
her
whole
appearance
expressive
of
an
extremity
of
fatigue
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
years
since
she
had
left
the
quay
at
antwerp
and
here
was
this
young
thing
as
blooming
as
though
she
had
spent
the
night
in
her
own
bed
she
hitched
a
shawl
more
closely
over
her
shoulders
and
called
aloud
in
a
high
imperious
tone
mason
mason
you
must
really
rouse
yourself
and
attend
to
me
we
shall
have
to
land
in
a
few
minutes
get
up
at
once
and
bring
me
my
things
the
covering
of
another
bunk
stirred
feebly
and
two
feet
encased
in
black
merino
stockings
descended
slowly
to
the
floor
a
moment
later
a
ghastly
figure
was
tottering
across
the
floor
lifting
from
a
box
a
beautifully
waved
white
wig
and
dropping
it
carefully
over
the
head
of
the
aggrieved
old
lady
of
the
straggly
locks
it
was
all
that
claire
could
do
to
keep
from
exclaiming
aloud
as
it
burst
upon
her
astonished
senses
that
this
poor
huddled
creature
was
none
other
than
the
of
the
railway
carriage
the
haughtily
indifferent
cynically
amused
personage
who
had
seemed
so
supremely
superior
to
the
agitations
of
the
common
ruck
strange
what
changes
a
few
hours
conflict
with
the
forces
of
nature
could
bring
about
ill
as
the
mistress
was
the
maid
was
even
worse
and
it
was
pitiful
to
see
the
poor
creature
efforts
to
obey
the
exigent
demands
of
her
employer
in
the
end
faintness
overcame
her
and
if
claire
had
not
rushed
to
the
rescue
she
would
have
fallen
on
the
floor
it
no
use
struggling
against
it
you
must
keep
still
until
the
boat
stops
you
feel
better
at
once
when
we
land
and
you
get
into
the
air
claire
laid
the
poor
soul
in
her
bunk
and
turned
back
to
the
old
lady
who
was
momentarily
growing
younger
and
more
formidable
as
she
continued
the
stages
of
her
toilette
can
i
help
you
she
asked
smilingly
and
the
offer
was
accepted
with
gracious
composure
please
do
i
should
be
grateful
thank
you
that
hook
fastens
over
here
and
the
band
crosses
to
this
side
the
brooch
is
in
my
bag
a
gold
band
with
some
diamonds
and
the
and
a
clean
handkerchief
can
you
manage
the
clasp
slides
back
claire
opened
the
bag
and
gazed
with
admiration
at
a
brown
antique
lining
and
fittings
of
tortoiseshell
bearing
raised
monograms
in
gold
i
shall
have
one
exactly
to
match
when
i
marry
my
duke
was
the
mental
reflection
as
she
selected
the
articles
mentioned
and
put
the
final
touches
to
the
good
lady
costume
later
on
there
was
mason
to
be
dressed
later
on
still
claire
found
herself
carrying
the
precious
in
one
hand
and
supporting
one
invalid
with
the
other
while
mason
tottered
in
the
wake
unable
for
the
moment
to
support
any
other
burden
than
that
of
her
own
body
mrs
fanshawe
claire
had
discovered
the
name
on
a
printed
card
let
into
the
lining
of
the
bag
had
no
sympathy
to
spare
for
poor
mason
she
plainly
considered
it
the
height
of
bad
manners
for
a
maid
to
dare
to
be
but
being
unused
to
do
anything
for
herself
gratefully
allowed
claire
to
lead
the
way
reply
to
the
queries
of
officials
secure
a
corner
of
a
compartment
of
the
waiting
train
and
bid
an
attendant
bring
a
cup
of
tea
before
the
ordinary
breakfast
began
mason
refused
any
refreshment
but
mrs
fanshawe
momentarily
regained
her
vigour
and
was
all
that
was
gracious
in
her
acknowledgment
of
claire
help
the
quizzical
eyes
roved
over
the
girl
face
and
figure
and
evidently
approved
what
they
saw
and
claire
smiling
back
was
conscious
of
an
answering
attraction
thoughtless
and
domineering
as
was
her
behaviour
to
her
inferior
there
was
yet
something
in
the
old
lady
personality
which
struck
an
answering
chord
in
the
girl
heart
she
was
enough
of
a
physiognomist
to
divine
the
presence
of
humour
and
generosity
combined
with
a
persistent
cheerfulness
of
outlook
the
signs
of
physical
age
were
unmistakable
but
the
spirit
within
was
young
young
as
her
own
the
mutual
scrutiny
ended
in
a
mutual
laugh
which
was
the
last
breaking
of
the
ice
my
dear
cried
mrs
fanshawe
you
must
excuse
my
bad
manners
you
are
so
refreshing
to
look
at
after
all
those
horrors
on
the
boat
that
i
ca
help
staring
and
you
been
so
kind
positively
i
do
know
how
i
should
have
survived
without
you
will
you
tell
me
your
name
i
should
like
to
know
to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
so
much
help
my
name
is
claire
gifford
er
yes
plainly
mrs
fanshawe
felt
the
information
insufficient
gifford
i
knew
some
giffords
do
you
belong
to
the
worcestershire
branch
claire
hitched
her
shoulders
in
the
true
french
shrug
i
have
no
english
relations
nearer
than
second
cousins
and
we
have
lived
abroad
so
much
that
we
are
practically
strangers
my
father
died
when
i
was
a
child
i
went
to
school
in
paris
and
for
the
last
few
years
my
mother
and
i
have
made
our
headquarters
in
brussels
she
married
again
only
yesterday
and
is
going
to
live
in
bombay
mrs
fanshawe
arched
surprised
brows
and
you
are
staying
behind
yes
they
asked
me
to
go
mr
judge
is
very
kind
he
is
my
er
stepfather
claire
shrugged
again
at
the
strangeness
of
that
word
he
gave
me
the
warmest
of
invitations
but
i
refused
i
preferred
to
be
left
mrs
fanshawe
hitched
herself
into
her
corner
planted
her
feet
more
firmly
on
the
provisionary
footstool
and
folded
her
hands
on
her
knee
she
had
the
air
of
a
person
settling
down
to
the
enjoyment
of
a
favourite
amusement
and
indeed
her
curiosity
was
a
quality
to
all
her
acquaintances
why
she
asked
boldly
and
such
was
the
force
of
her
personality
that
claire
never
dreamt
for
a
moment
of
refusing
to
reply
because
i
want
to
be
independent
mrs
fanshawe
rolled
her
eyes
to
the
my
dear
nonsense
you
far
too
pretty
leave
that
to
the
poor
creatures
who
have
no
chance
of
finding
other
people
to
work
for
them
you
should
change
your
mind
you
know
you
really
should
india
quite
an
agreeable
place
to
put
in
a
few
years
the
english
girl
is
a
trifle
overdone
but
with
your
complexion
you
would
be
bound
to
have
a
success
think
it
over
do
be
in
a
hurry
to
let
the
chance
slip
it
slipped
they
sail
from
marseilles
a
week
from
and
besides
i
do
want
to
change
i
like
the
prospect
of
independence
better
even
than
being
admired
though
you
like
that
too
of
course
who
does
i
hoping
with
good
luck
to
be
admired
in
england
instead
then
you
must
be
independent
mrs
fanshawe
said
laughing
it
was
the
rage
a
year
or
two
ago
girls
had
a
craze
for
joining
settlements
and
running
about
in
the
slums
but
it
quite
out
of
date
hobble
skirts
killed
it
it
impossible
to
be
utilitarian
in
a
hobble
skirt
and
how
do
you
propose
to
show
your
independence
may
i
ask
i
am
going
to
be
french
mistress
in
a
high
school
claire
said
sturdily
and
hated
herself
because
she
winced
before
the
eloquent
change
of
expression
which
passed
over
her
companion
face
mrs
fanshawe
said
oh
really
how
interesting
and
looked
about
as
uninterested
the
while
as
a
human
creature
could
be
in
the
pause
which
followed
it
was
obvious
that
she
was
readjusting
the
first
impression
of
a
young
gentlewoman
belonging
to
her
own
leisured
class
and
preparing
herself
to
an
entirely
different
person
an
ordinary
teacher
in
a
high
school
there
was
a
touch
of
patronage
in
her
manner
but
it
was
still
quite
agreeable
mrs
fanshawe
was
always
agreeable
for
choice
she
found
it
the
best
policy
and
her
indolent
nature
shrank
from
disagreeables
of
every
kind
this
pretty
girl
had
made
herself
quite
useful
and
a
chat
with
her
would
enliven
a
dull
hour
in
the
train
curiosity
shifted
its
point
but
remained
actively
in
force
tell
me
all
about
it
she
said
suavely
i
know
nothing
about
teachers
shocking
is
it
they
alarm
me
too
much
i
have
a
horror
of
clever
women
you
do
look
at
all
clever
i
mean
that
as
a
compliment
far
too
pretty
and
smart
but
i
suppose
you
are
dreadfully
learned
all
the
same
what
are
you
going
to
teach
french
i
am
almost
as
good
as
a
frenchwoman
for
i
talked
little
else
for
sixteen
years
mother
and
i
spoke
english
together
or
i
should
have
forgotten
my
own
language
it
seems
from
a
scholastic
point
of
view
that
it
a
useful
blend
to
possess
perfect
french
and
an
english
temperament
is
not
always
a
model
of
patience
and
you
think
you
will
be
i
prophesy
differently
you
throw
the
whole
thing
up
in
six
months
and
fly
off
to
mamma
in
india
you
have
the
least
idea
what
you
are
in
for
but
you
find
out
find
out
where
is
this
precious
school
in
town
did
you
say
shall
you
live
in
the
house
or
with
friends
i
have
no
friends
in
london
except
miss
farnborough
the
head
mistress
but
there
are
fifteen
other
mistresses
besides
myself
that
will
be
fifteen
friends
i
am
going
to
share
lodgings
with
one
of
them
and
be
a
bachelor
girl
on
my
own
account
i
so
excited
about
it
after
living
in
countries
where
a
girl
ca
go
to
the
alone
it
will
be
thrilling
to
be
free
to
do
just
as
i
like
please
do
pity
me
i
going
to
have
great
fun
mrs
fanshawe
hitched
herself
still
further
into
her
corner
and
smiled
a
lazy
quizzical
smile
oh
i
do
pity
you
not
one
bit
all
young
people
nowadays
think
they
are
so
much
wiser
than
their
parents
it
a
wholesome
lesson
to
learn
their
mistake
you
a
silly
blind
ridiculous
little
girl
and
if
i
been
your
mother
i
should
have
insisted
upon
taking
you
with
me
whether
you
liked
it
or
not
i
always
wanted
a
daughter
like
you
sons
are
so
dull
but
perhaps
it
just
as
well
that
she
never
appeared
she
might
have
wanted
to
be
independent
too
in
which
case
we
should
have
so
those
fifteen
make
up
your
whole
social
circle
do
they
i
would
mind
prophesying
that
you
never
want
to
speak
a
word
to
them
out
of
school
hours
i
have
a
friend
living
in
town
quite
a
nice
woman
with
a
daughter
about
your
age
shall
i
ask
her
to
send
you
a
card
it
would
be
somewhere
for
you
to
go
on
free
afternoons
and
she
entertains
a
good
deal
and
has
a
craze
for
the
feminist
movement
and
for
girls
who
work
for
themselves
you
might
come
in
for
some
fun
claire
flush
of
gratification
made
her
look
prettier
than
ever
and
mrs
fanshawe
felt
an
agreeable
glow
of
nothing
she
liked
better
than
to
play
the
part
of
lady
bountiful
especially
when
any
effort
involved
was
shifted
onto
the
shoulders
of
another
and
in
her
careless
fashion
she
was
really
anxious
to
do
this
nice
girl
a
good
turn
she
made
a
note
of
claire
address
in
a
dainty
expressed
pleasure
in
the
belief
that
through
her
friend
she
would
hear
reports
of
the
girl
progress
and
presently
shut
her
eyes
and
dozed
peacefully
for
the
rest
of
the
ride
round
london
a
fine
rain
was
falling
and
the
terminus
looked
bleak
and
cheerless
as
the
train
slowed
down
the
long
platform
mason
still
haggard
roused
herself
to
step
to
the
platform
and
look
around
as
if
expecting
to
see
a
familiar
face
and
in
the
midst
of
collecting
her
own
impedimenta
claire
was
conscious
that
mrs
fanshawe
was
distinctly
ruffled
when
the
familiar
figure
failed
to
appear
once
more
she
found
herself
coming
to
the
rescue
marshalling
the
combined
baggage
to
the
screened
portion
of
the
platform
where
the
officials
went
through
the
formalities
incidental
to
the
occasion
while
the
tired
passengers
stood
shiveringly
on
guard
looking
bleached
and
grey
after
their
night
journey
the
girl
stood
out
in
pleasant
contrast
to
the
rest
trim
and
smart
and
dainty
as
though
such
a
thing
as
fatigue
did
not
exist
mrs
fanshawe
looking
at
her
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
a
mental
grumble
and
turned
it
round
so
that
it
ended
in
being
a
thanksgiving
instead
most
neglectful
of
erskine
to
fail
me
after
promising
he
would
come
perhaps
after
all
it
just
as
well
he
did
not
and
at
that
moment
with
the
usual
contrariety
of
fate
erskine
appeared
he
came
striding
along
the
platform
a
big
man
with
a
face
glancing
to
right
and
left
over
the
upstanding
collar
of
a
tweed
coat
he
looked
at
once
plain
and
distinguished
and
in
the
quizzical
eyes
and
beetling
eyebrows
there
was
an
unmistakable
likeness
to
the
standing
by
claire
side
just
for
a
moment
he
paused
as
he
came
in
sight
of
the
group
of
passengers
and
claire
meeting
his
glance
knew
who
he
was
even
before
he
came
forward
and
made
his
greeting
holla
mater
sorry
to
be
late
not
my
fault
this
time
i
was
ready
all
right
but
the
car
did
not
come
round
had
a
good
crossing
my
dear
appalling
do
talk
of
it
i
was
prostrate
all
night
and
mason
too
ill
to
do
anything
but
moan
she
been
no
use
poor
beggar
she
looks
pretty
green
but
er
the
plain
face
lighted
with
an
expectant
smile
as
he
turned
towards
the
girl
who
stood
by
his
mother
side
still
holding
the
precious
bag
you
seem
to
have
met
a
friend
oh
er
yes
with
a
gesture
of
regal
graciousness
mrs
fanshawe
turned
towards
the
girl
and
held
out
her
gloved
hand
thank
you
much
miss
gifford
you
been
quite
too
kind
i
really
horribly
in
your
debt
i
hope
you
will
find
everything
as
you
like
and
have
a
very
good
time
thank
you
again
i
really
dropping
with
fatigue
what
a
relief
it
will
be
to
get
to
bed
she
turned
aside
and
laid
her
hand
on
her
son
arm
erskine
where
the
car
mother
and
son
turned
away
and
made
their
way
down
the
platform
leaving
claire
with
crimson
cheeks
and
heart
the
little
scene
which
had
just
happened
had
been
all
too
easy
to
understand
the
nice
son
had
wished
for
an
introduction
to
the
nice
girl
who
a
moment
before
had
seemed
on
such
intimate
terms
with
his
mother
the
mother
had
been
quite
determined
that
such
an
introduction
should
not
take
place
claire
knew
enough
of
the
world
to
realise
how
different
would
have
been
the
proceedings
if
she
had
announced
herself
as
a
member
of
the
idle
rich
bound
for
a
course
of
visits
to
houses
in
the
country
may
i
introduce
my
son
miss
gifford
miss
gifford
has
been
an
angel
of
goodness
to
me
erskine
positively
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
without
her
do
look
after
her
now
and
see
her
into
a
taxi
such
a
mercy
to
have
a
man
to
help
that
was
what
would
have
happened
to
the
claire
gifford
of
a
week
before
but
now
for
the
first
time
claire
experienced
a
taste
of
the
disagreeables
attendant
on
her
changed
circumstances
and
it
was
bitter
to
her
mouth
all
very
well
to
remind
herself
that
work
was
honourable
that
anyone
who
looked
down
on
her
for
choosing
to
be
independent
was
not
worth
a
moment
thought
the
fact
remained
that
for
the
first
the
very
first
time
in
her
life
she
had
been
made
to
feel
that
there
was
a
barrier
between
herself
and
a
member
of
her
own
class
and
that
however
willing
mrs
fanshawe
might
be
to
introduce
her
to
a
casual
friend
she
was
unwilling
to
make
her
known
to
her
own
son
claire
stood
stiff
and
at
her
post
determined
to
make
no
movement
until
mrs
fanshawe
and
her
attendants
had
taken
their
departure
the
storm
of
indignation
and
wounded
pride
which
was
surging
through
her
veins
distracted
her
mind
from
her
surroundings
she
was
dimly
conscious
that
one
after
another
her
had
taken
their
departure
preceded
by
a
porter
trundling
a
truck
of
luggage
conscious
that
where
there
had
been
a
crowd
there
was
now
a
space
until
eventually
with
a
shock
of
surprise
she
discovered
that
she
was
standing
alone
by
her
own
little
pile
of
boxes
at
that
she
shook
herself
impatiently
beckoned
to
a
porter
and
was
about
to
walk
ahead
when
an
uneasy
suspicion
made
itself
felt
the
luggage
something
was
wrong
the
pile
looked
smaller
than
it
had
done
ten
minutes
before
she
made
a
rapid
circuit
and
made
a
horrible
discovery
a
box
was
missing
the
containing
the
skirts
of
all
her
best
frocks
spread
at
full
length
and
carefully
padded
with
tissue
paper
it
had
been
there
ten
minutes
ago
the
officer
had
given
it
a
special
rap
she
distinctly
remembered
noticing
a
new
scratch
on
the
leather
where
in
the
name
of
everything
that
was
inexplicable
could
it
have
disappeared
appealed
to
for
information
the
porter
was
not
illuminating
if
it
had
been
there
before
why
was
it
there
now
was
the
lady
she
had
seen
it
might
have
been
left
behind
at
antwerp
or
parkeston
better
telegraph
and
see
if
it
had
been
there
before
why
was
it
there
now
mistakes
did
happen
boxes
were
much
alike
it
was
left
in
the
van
if
it
was
there
ten
minutes
before
why
was
it
claire
stopped
him
with
an
imperious
hand
that
enough
it
there
i
saw
it
i
counted
the
pieces
before
the
officer
came
along
i
noticed
it
especially
someone
must
have
taken
it
by
mistake
the
porter
shook
his
head
darkly
on
purpose
more
like
funny
people
crosses
by
this
route
funny
thing
that
you
did
notice
claire
found
nothing
funny
in
the
reflection
she
was
furious
with
herself
for
her
carelessness
and
still
more
furious
with
mrs
fanshawe
as
the
cause
thereof
down
the
platform
she
stalked
a
picture
of
vivid
impetuous
youth
head
thrown
back
cheeks
aflame
grey
eyes
sending
out
flashes
of
indignation
every
porter
who
came
in
her
way
was
stopped
and
imperiously
questioned
as
to
his
late
load
every
porter
was
in
his
turn
waved
impatiently
away
claire
was
growing
seriously
alarmed
suppose
the
box
was
lost
it
would
be
as
bad
as
losing
boxes
for
of
what
use
were
bodices
minus
skirts
to
match
never
again
would
she
be
guilty
of
the
folly
of
packing
bits
of
the
same
costumes
in
different
boxes
how
awful
how
awful
beyond
words
to
arrive
in
london
without
a
decent
dress
to
wear
whirling
suddenly
round
to
pursue
yet
another
porter
claire
became
aware
of
a
figure
in
a
long
tweed
coat
standing
on
the
space
beside
the
intently
watching
her
movements
she
recognised
him
in
a
moment
as
none
other
than
erskine
himself
who
having
seen
his
mother
into
her
car
was
presumably
bound
for
another
destination
but
why
was
he
standing
there
why
had
he
been
so
long
in
moving
away
claire
hastily
averted
her
eyes
but
as
she
porter
number
four
she
was
aware
that
the
tall
figure
was
drawing
nearer
and
presently
he
was
standing
by
her
side
taking
off
his
hat
and
saying
in
the
most
courteous
and
deferential
of
tones
excuse
me
i
afraid
something
is
wrong
can
i
be
of
any
assistance
claire
glance
was
frigid
in
its
coldness
but
it
was
difficult
to
remain
frigid
in
face
of
the
man
obvious
sincerity
and
kindliness
thank
you
she
said
quietly
please
do
trouble
i
can
manage
quite
well
it
only
a
trunk
is
it
lost
i
say
what
a
fag
do
let
me
help
i
know
this
station
by
heart
if
it
is
to
be
found
i
am
sure
i
can
get
it
for
you
this
time
there
was
a
distinct
air
of
appeal
in
his
deep
voice
claire
divined
that
the
nice
man
was
anxious
to
atone
for
his
mother
cavalier
behaviour
and
her
heart
softened
towards
him
after
all
why
should
she
punish
herself
by
refusing
five
minutes
more
or
less
on
the
station
platform
could
make
no
difference
one
way
or
another
for
at
the
end
they
would
wish
each
other
a
polite
adieu
and
part
never
to
meet
again
and
she
want
that
box
she
smiled
and
sighed
and
looked
delightfully
pretty
and
appealing
as
she
said
frankly
thank
you
i
be
grateful
for
suggestions
it
the
most
extraordinary
and
provoking
thing
they
walked
slowly
down
the
platform
while
she
explained
the
situation
and
reiterated
the
fact
that
she
had
seen
the
box
ten
minutes
before
erskine
fanshawe
did
not
dispute
the
statement
as
each
porter
had
done
before
him
he
contented
himself
with
asking
if
there
was
any
distinctive
feature
in
the
appearance
of
the
box
itself
claire
shook
her
head
the
ordinary
brown
leather
with
strappings
and
on
one
side
just
like
a
thousand
other
boxes
but
it
had
a
label
beside
the
initials
i
do
see
how
anyone
can
have
taken
it
by
mistake
she
set
her
teeth
and
her
head
took
a
defiant
tilt
there
one
comfort
if
it
stolen
whoever
has
taken
it
will
not
get
much
for
her
pains
nothing
in
it
but
skirts
skirts
wo
be
much
good
without
the
bodices
to
match
the
man
looked
down
at
her
his
expression
comically
compounded
of
sympathy
and
humour
at
that
moment
despite
the
irregularity
of
his
features
he
looked
wonderfully
like
his
handsome
mother
er
just
so
unfortunately
however
from
the
opposite
point
of
view
you
find
yourself
in
the
same
position
bodices
i
presume
without
skirts
claire
groaned
and
held
up
a
protesting
hand
do
i
ca
bear
it
it
really
devastating
my
whole
outfit
at
one
fell
sweep
is
it
excuse
my
suggesting
it
rather
a
mistake
to
er
divide
pieces
of
the
same
garment
that
if
one
trunk
should
be
lost
the
loss
practically
extends
to
two
no
it
is
it
the
only
sensible
thing
to
do
claire
said
obstinately
skirts
must
be
packed
at
full
length
and
a
is
made
for
that
very
purpose
all
the
same
i
shall
never
do
it
again
it
no
use
being
sensible
if
you
have
to
contend
with
i
do
think
we
need
leap
to
that
conclusion
just
yet
you
have
only
spoken
to
two
or
three
porters
we
better
wait
about
a
few
minutes
longer
until
the
other
men
come
back
very
likely
the
box
was
put
on
a
truck
by
accident
and
if
the
mistake
was
discovered
before
it
was
put
on
the
taxi
it
would
be
sent
back
to
see
if
its
owner
were
waiting
here
if
it
does
turn
up
at
once
you
must
be
discouraged
the
odds
are
ten
to
one
that
it
only
a
mistake
and
in
that
case
when
the
taxi
is
unloaded
the
box
will
be
sent
back
to
the
lost
luggage
office
or
forwarded
to
your
address
was
the
full
address
on
the
box
by
the
way
claire
nodded
assent
oh
yes
i
have
that
poor
satisfaction
at
least
i
was
most
methodical
and
prudent
but
i
do
know
that
that
going
to
be
much
consolation
if
i
lose
my
nice
frocks
and
am
too
poor
to
buy
any
more
the
last
phrase
was
prompted
by
a
proud
determination
to
sail
under
no
false
colours
in
the
eyes
of
mrs
fanshawe
son
but
the
picture
evoked
thereby
was
sufficiently
tragic
to
bring
a
cloud
over
her
face
the
memory
of
each
separate
gown
rose
before
her
looking
distractingly
dainty
and
becoming
she
saw
a
vision
of
herself
as
she
might
have
been
and
faced
a
future
bounded
by
eternal
blue
serge
all
the
tragedy
of
the
thought
was
in
her
air
and
her
companion
cried
quickly
you
wo
need
to
buy
them
they
turn
up
all
right
i
am
quite
sure
of
that
the
worst
that
can
happen
is
a
day
or
two
delay
after
all
you
know
there
are
thousands
of
honest
folk
to
a
single
thief
and
even
a
thief
would
probably
prefer
a
small
money
reward
to
useless
halves
of
dresses
if
you
hear
nothing
by
you
might
offer
a
reward
oh
i
will
claire
said
gratefully
thank
you
for
thinking
of
it
no
more
porters
having
for
the
moment
appeared
in
sight
they
now
turned
and
slowly
retraced
their
steps
claire
covertly
regarding
her
companion
wondered
why
she
felt
convinced
that
he
was
a
soldier
erskine
fanshawe
in
his
turn
covertly
regarded
claire
and
wondered
why
it
was
that
she
seemed
different
from
any
girl
he
had
seen
before
then
tentatively
he
put
a
personal
question
do
you
know
london
well
miss
gifford
my
mother
told
me
you
were
er
coming
to
settle
not
at
all
well
as
a
whole
i
know
the
little
bit
around
regent
street
and
the
park
and
the
places
one
sees
in
a
week
visit
but
that
all
we
never
stayed
long
in
town
when
we
came
to
england
i
shall
enjoy
exploring
on
half
holidays
when
i
am
free
from
work
i
am
a
said
claire
with
an
air
and
gathered
from
her
companion
face
that
he
knew
as
much
already
and
considered
it
a
subject
for
commiseration
he
looked
at
her
with
sympathetic
eyes
and
asked
deeply
hate
it
very
much
not
at
all
quite
the
contrary
i
adore
it
at
least
that
to
say
i
have
begun
yet
but
i
feel
sure
i
claire
cried
ardently
and
at
that
they
both
laughed
with
a
delightful
sense
of
understanding
and
at
that
moment
claire
felt
a
distinct
pang
at
the
thought
that
never
again
would
she
have
the
opportunity
of
speaking
and
laughing
with
this
attractive
eminently
companionable
man
then
her
attention
was
distracted
by
the
appearance
of
two
more
porters
who
had
each
to
be
interviewed
in
his
turn
they
had
no
good
news
to
give
however
so
the
searchers
left
the
platform
in
disgust
and
repaired
to
the
office
for
lost
luggage
where
the
story
of
the
missing
box
was
recounted
to
an
unsympathetic
clerk
when
a
man
spends
his
whole
life
listening
to
complaints
of
missing
property
he
can
hardly
be
expected
to
show
a
vehement
distress
at
the
loss
of
yet
another
passenger
but
to
claire
at
this
moment
there
was
something
quite
brutal
in
his
callous
indifference
the
one
suggestion
which
he
had
to
make
was
that
she
could
leave
her
name
and
the
manner
in
which
it
was
given
was
a
to
hope
at
this
very
moment
however
just
as
claire
was
bending
forward
to
dictate
the
desired
information
she
felt
a
touch
on
her
arm
and
looking
in
the
direction
of
mr
fanshawe
outstretched
hand
beheld
a
porter
approaching
the
office
trundling
before
him
a
truck
on
which
reposed
in
solitary
splendour
a
long
brown
and
oh
joy
of
joys
even
at
the
present
distance
the
white
letters
could
be
plainly
distinguished
on
the
nearer
side
claire
dignity
went
to
the
winds
at
that
sight
and
she
dashed
forward
to
meet
her
property
with
the
joyous
impetuosity
of
a
child
the
explanation
was
simple
to
a
degree
and
precisely
agreed
with
mr
fanshawe
surmise
as
to
what
had
really
happened
during
trance
of
forgetfulness
the
box
had
been
wheeled
away
with
a
large
consignment
of
luggage
and
the
mistake
discovered
only
when
the
various
items
were
in
process
of
being
packed
into
a
company
omnibus
when
there
being
no
one
at
hand
to
claim
it
it
had
been
conveyed
by
very
leisurely
stages
to
the
lost
luggage
office
all
well
that
ends
well
claire
gleefully
collected
her
possessions
feeling
a
glow
of
delight
in
the
safety
which
an
hour
before
she
would
have
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
and
stood
at
attention
while
each
separate
item
was
placed
on
the
roof
of
the
taxi
the
little
addresses
of
which
she
had
boasted
were
duly
inserted
in
leather
framings
on
each
box
the
delicate
writing
too
small
to
be
deciphered
except
near
at
hand
claire
saw
her
companion
eyes
contract
in
an
evident
effort
to
distinguish
the
words
and
immediately
moved
her
position
so
as
to
frustrate
his
purpose
she
did
not
intend
mr
fanshawe
to
know
her
address
when
she
was
seated
in
the
taxi
however
there
came
an
awkward
moment
for
her
companion
waved
the
chauffeur
to
his
seat
and
stood
by
the
window
looking
in
at
her
with
a
face
which
seemed
unduly
serious
and
earnest
considering
the
extremely
slight
nature
of
their
acquaintance
well
i
am
thankful
the
box
turned
up
i
shall
think
of
you
enjoying
your
frocks
sure
you
got
everything
all
right
where
shall
i
tell
the
man
to
drive
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
claire
eyes
flickered
then
she
spoke
in
decided
tones
grand
hotel
mr
fanshawe
eyes
flickered
too
and
turned
involuntarily
towards
the
boxes
on
the
roof
what
exactly
were
the
words
on
the
labels
he
could
not
see
but
at
least
it
was
certain
that
they
were
not
the
grand
hotel
he
turned
from
the
inspection
to
confront
a
flushed
obstinate
face
do
you
wish
me
to
give
the
man
that
address
i
do
very
deliberately
and
quietly
mr
fanshawe
stepped
back
a
pace
opened
his
long
coat
and
fumbled
in
an
inner
pocket
for
a
leather
very
quietly
and
deliberately
he
drew
from
one
bulging
division
a
visiting
card
and
held
it
towards
her
claire
caught
the
word
captain
and
saw
that
an
address
was
printed
in
the
corner
but
she
covered
it
hastily
with
her
hand
refusing
a
second
glance
captain
fanshawe
leant
his
arm
on
the
window
sash
and
said
hesitatingly
will
you
allow
me
to
give
you
my
card
as
you
are
a
stranger
in
town
and
your
people
away
there
may
possibly
be
er
occasions
when
it
would
be
convenient
to
know
some
man
whom
you
could
make
of
use
please
remember
me
if
they
do
come
along
it
would
be
a
privilege
to
repay
your
kindness
to
my
mother
send
me
a
wire
at
any
time
and
i
am
at
your
service
i
hope
you
send
good
morning
said
claire
red
as
a
rose
was
she
at
that
moment
but
very
dignified
and
stately
bending
towards
him
in
a
sweeping
bow
as
the
taxi
rolled
away
the
last
glimpse
of
captain
fanshawe
showed
him
standing
with
uplifted
hat
the
keen
eyes
staring
after
her
with
not
a
glint
of
humour
in
their
grey
depths
quite
evidently
he
meant
what
he
said
quite
evidently
he
was
as
keen
to
pursue
her
acquaintance
as
his
mother
had
been
to
drop
it
claire
gifford
sat
bolt
upright
on
her
seat
the
slip
of
cardboard
clasped
within
her
palms
and
as
she
sat
she
thought
many
thoughts
a
physiognomist
would
have
been
interested
to
trace
the
progress
of
those
thoughts
on
the
eloquent
young
face
there
was
surprise
written
there
and
obvious
gratification
and
a
demure
very
feminine
content
later
on
came
pride
and
a
general
stiffening
of
determination
the
spoiled
child
of
liberty
and
the
high
of
the
future
had
fought
a
heated
battle
and
the
high
had
won
deliberately
turning
aside
her
eyes
so
that
no
word
of
that
printed
address
should
obtrude
itself
on
her
notice
claire
tore
the
card
sharply
across
and
across
and
threw
the
fragments
out
of
the
window
a
moment
later
she
whistled
through
the
tube
and
instructed
the
chauffeur
as
to
her
change
of
address
adieu
to
the
fanshawes
and
all
such
luxuries
of
the
past
for
hard
work
and
lodgings
at
fifteen
shillings
a
week
chapter
five
miss
rhodes
poisoner
it
is
a
somewhat
dreary
feeling
to
arrive
even
at
a
friend
house
before
seven
in
the
morning
and
be
received
by
people
who
have
obviously
been
torn
unwillingly
from
their
beds
in
deference
to
the
precepts
of
hospitality
but
it
is
infinitely
worse
to
arrive
at
a
at
the
same
hour
ring
several
times
at
the
bell
before
a
dingy
servant
can
be
induced
to
appear
and
to
realise
a
moment
later
that
in
a
tireless
parlour
you
perceive
your
goal
claire
gifford
felt
a
creep
of
the
blood
at
the
sight
of
that
parlour
though
if
her
first
introduction
had
been
at
night
when
the
curtains
were
drawn
and
the
lamps
lit
she
would
have
found
it
cosy
enough
there
was
no
sign
of
her
perhaps
it
was
too
much
to
expect
her
to
get
up
at
so
early
an
hour
to
welcome
a
stranger
but
claire
expected
it
felt
perfectly
sure
that
had
positions
been
reversed
she
herself
would
have
taken
pains
to
deck
both
herself
and
her
room
in
honour
of
the
occasion
and
so
felt
correspondingly
downcast
presently
she
found
herself
following
the
dingy
maid
up
three
separate
nights
of
stairs
and
arriving
at
a
tiny
box
of
a
bedroom
on
the
top
floor
there
was
a
bed
a
washstand
a
chest
of
drawers
doing
service
as
a
two
chairs
and
a
sloping
roof
claire
would
have
been
quite
disappointed
if
that
last
item
had
been
missing
for
whoever
heard
of
a
girl
who
set
out
to
make
her
own
living
who
had
not
slept
in
a
room
with
a
sloping
roof
on
the
whole
despite
its
tiny
proportions
the
little
room
made
a
pleasant
impression
it
was
clean
it
was
bright
walls
and
furniture
were
alike
of
a
plain
unrelieved
white
and
through
the
open
casement
window
could
be
seen
a
distant
slope
of
green
overtopping
the
intervening
chimney
tops
claire
eyes
roved
here
and
there
with
the
instinct
of
a
born
saw
what
was
lacking
here
what
was
superfluous
there
grasped
neglected
possibilities
and
mentally
and
decorated
the
premises
before
a
slower
person
would
have
crossed
the
floor
then
she
took
up
her
stand
before
the
small
mirror
and
devoted
a
whole
minute
to
studying
her
own
reflection
from
the
point
of
view
of
captain
erskine
fanshawe
of
unknown
address
by
her
own
deliberate
choice
she
had
cut
herself
off
from
future
chance
of
meeting
this
acquaintance
of
an
hour
nevertheless
it
was
distinctly
reviving
to
discern
that
her
hat
was
set
at
precisely
the
right
angle
and
that
for
an
voyager
her
whole
appearance
was
remarkably
fresh
and
dainty
claire
first
smiled
and
then
sighed
and
pulled
out
the
with
impatient
tugs
to
be
prudent
and
is
not
always
an
exhilarating
process
for
sweet
and
twenty
presently
the
maid
came
staggering
upstairs
with
the
smaller
boxes
and
claire
busied
herself
in
her
room
until
the
clock
had
struck
eight
when
she
again
descended
to
the
joint
this
time
the
fire
was
lighted
and
the
table
laid
for
breakfast
and
behind
the
sat
miss
rhodes
the
english
mistress
already
halfway
through
her
meal
she
rose
half
smiling
half
frowning
and
held
out
a
thin
hand
in
welcome
morning
hope
you
had
a
good
crossing
did
know
when
you
be
down
do
you
take
coffee
please
claire
felt
that
a
cup
of
coffee
would
be
just
what
she
needed
but
missed
the
familiar
fragrant
scent
she
seated
herself
at
the
table
and
while
miss
rhodes
went
on
with
her
preparation
studied
her
with
curious
eyes
she
saw
a
woman
of
or
three
with
features
dark
eyes
and
abundant
dark
hair
a
woman
who
ought
to
have
been
distinctly
but
who
succeeded
in
being
plain
and
commonplace
she
was
in
a
utility
blouse
of
grey
flannel
her
expression
was
tired
and
listless
and
her
hair
though
neat
showed
obvious
lack
of
care
having
none
of
the
silky
sheen
which
rewards
regular
systematic
brushing
so
far
bad
but
in
spite
of
all
drawbacks
it
was
an
interesting
face
and
claire
felt
attracted
despite
the
preliminary
disappointment
there
some
bacon
in
that
dish
it
will
be
cold
i
afraid
you
can
ring
if
you
like
and
ask
them
to
warm
it
up
but
they
keep
you
waiting
a
quarter
of
an
hour
out
of
spite
i
given
it
up
myself
oh
i
accustomed
to
french
breakfasts
i
really
want
nothing
but
some
bread
and
coffee
claire
sipped
at
her
cup
as
she
finished
speaking
and
the
sudden
grimace
of
astonishment
which
followed
roused
her
companion
to
laughter
you
do
like
it
it
is
equal
to
your
french
coffee
it
is
coffee
at
all
it
undrinkable
claire
pushed
away
her
cup
in
disgust
is
it
always
as
bad
as
that
worse
said
miss
rhodes
composedly
they
put
in
more
this
morning
because
of
you
sometimes
it
barely
coloured
and
it
always
chicory
she
shrugged
resignedly
no
english
landlady
can
make
coffee
it
no
use
worrying
have
to
make
the
best
of
what
comes
indeed
i
sha
why
should
i
i
sha
try
there
no
virtue
in
drinking
such
stuff
we
provide
the
coffee
what
to
hinder
us
making
it
for
ourselves
no
fire
as
a
rule
ca
afford
one
when
you
are
going
out
immediately
after
breakfast
claire
stared
in
dismay
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
she
might
have
to
be
economical
to
this
extent
but
when
it
very
cold
what
do
you
do
then
put
on
a
jersey
and
nurse
the
jug
claire
grimaced
then
nodded
with
an
air
of
determination
i
buy
a
machine
there
can
be
no
objection
to
that
you
would
prefer
good
coffee
would
you
if
you
could
get
it
without
any
more
trouble
oh
certainly
i
enjoy
it
while
it
lasts
why
should
it
last
miss
rhodes
stared
across
at
the
eager
young
face
she
looked
tired
and
a
trifle
impatient
oh
my
dear
girl
you
we
are
all
the
same
at
first
bubbling
over
with
energy
and
determined
to
arrange
everything
exactly
as
we
like
it
a
phase
which
we
all
live
through
afterwards
you
care
you
are
too
tired
to
worry
all
your
energy
goes
on
your
work
and
you
are
too
thankful
for
peace
and
quietness
to
bother
about
details
you
take
what
comes
and
are
thankful
it
not
worse
claire
smile
showed
an
elaborate
forbearance
rather
a
attitude
do
you
think
wait
and
see
said
the
english
mistress
she
rose
and
threw
herself
in
a
chair
by
the
window
and
claire
left
the
despised
coffee
and
followed
her
example
through
the
panes
she
looked
out
on
a
row
of
brick
houses
depressingly
dingy
depressingly
alike
about
every
second
house
showed
a
small
black
card
on
which
the
word
apartments
was
printed
in
gilt
letters
down
the
middle
of
the
street
came
a
fruiterer
cart
piled
high
with
wicker
baskets
the
cry
of
bananas
cheap
bananas
floated
raucously
on
the
air
claire
swiftly
averted
her
eyes
and
turned
back
to
her
companion
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
let
me
share
your
miss
farnborough
said
she
had
arranged
it
with
you
but
it
must
be
horrid
taking
in
a
stranger
i
will
try
not
to
be
too
great
a
bore
but
miss
rhodes
refused
to
be
thanked
i
bound
to
have
somebody
said
she
ungraciously
could
afford
them
alone
you
know
the
terms
shillings
a
week
for
the
three
rooms
that
cheap
in
this
neighbourhood
we
only
get
them
at
that
price
because
we
are
out
all
day
and
need
so
little
catering
she
looked
round
the
room
with
her
tired
mocking
smile
hope
you
admire
the
scheme
of
decoration
i
been
in
dozens
of
lodgings
but
i
do
think
i
ever
struck
an
uglier
room
but
the
people
are
clean
and
honest
and
one
has
to
put
that
before
beauty
in
our
circumstances
there
a
great
of
pattern
about
it
has
what
one
could
call
a
restful
effect
said
claire
looking
across
at
an
ochre
wall
bespattered
with
golden
scrawls
a
red
satin
painted
with
lustre
roses
a
suite
of
furniture
covered
in
green
stamped
plush
a
collection
of
inartistic
pictures
and
unornamental
ornaments
even
her
spirit
quailed
before
the
hopelessness
of
beautifying
a
room
in
which
all
the
essentials
were
so
hopelessly
wrong
she
gave
it
up
in
despair
and
returned
to
the
question
of
finance
then
my
share
will
be
seventeen
and
six
that
seems
very
cheap
i
am
to
begin
at
a
hundred
and
ten
pounds
how
much
extra
must
i
allow
for
food
that
depends
upon
your
requirements
we
have
dinner
at
school
quite
a
good
meal
for
ninepence
including
a
penny
for
coffee
afterwards
the
same
sort
of
coffee
we
have
had
this
morning
practically
a
trifle
better
perhaps
not
much
hurrah
cried
claire
gaily
that
a
penny
to
the
good
eightpence
for
me
a
clear
saving
of
fivepence
a
week
miss
rhodes
resolutely
refused
to
smile
she
had
the
air
of
thinking
it
ribald
to
be
cheerful
on
the
serious
question
of
pounds
shillings
and
pence
even
so
it
and
you
ca
do
breakfast
and
supper
and
full
board
on
saturday
and
sunday
under
seven
shillings
it
tight
enough
to
manage
on
that
altogether
it
often
mounts
up
to
twelve
seventeen
and
twelve
claire
pondered
deeply
before
she
arrived
at
a
solution
call
it
thirty
to
make
it
even
and
i
am
to
begin
at
a
hundred
and
ten
over
two
pounds
a
week
i
ought
to
do
it
comfortably
and
have
quite
a
lot
over
miss
rhodes
laughed
darkly
what
about
extras
she
demanded
what
about
laundry
and
fires
and
stationery
and
stamps
what
about
and
tubes
on
wet
days
and
soap
and
candles
and
dentist
and
medicines
and
subs
at
school
and
collections
in
church
and
travelling
expenses
on
saturdays
and
sundays
when
you
invariably
want
to
go
to
the
very
other
side
of
the
city
london
is
not
like
a
provincial
town
you
ca
stir
out
of
the
house
under
fourpence
or
sixpence
at
the
very
least
what
about
illness
and
amusement
and
holidays
what
about
claire
thrust
her
fingers
in
her
ears
with
an
air
of
desperation
stop
stop
for
pity
sake
do
swamp
me
any
more
i
feel
in
the
bankruptcy
court
already
and
i
had
imagined
that
i
was
rich
a
hundred
and
ten
pounds
seemed
quite
a
big
salary
everybody
was
surprised
at
my
getting
so
much
and
i
suppose
you
have
even
more
a
hundred
and
fifty
yes
you
must
remember
that
we
do
belong
to
the
ordinary
rut
of
worker
we
are
experts
our
education
has
been
a
long
costly
business
no
untrained
worker
could
take
our
place
we
are
entitled
to
expert
pay
oh
yes
they
are
quite
good
salaries
if
you
happen
to
have
a
home
behind
you
and
people
who
are
ready
to
help
over
rough
times
instead
of
needing
to
be
helped
themselves
the
pity
of
it
is
that
most
high
come
from
families
who
are
rich
the
parents
have
made
a
big
effort
to
pay
for
the
education
and
when
they
are
fairly
launched
they
expect
to
be
helped
in
return
some
girls
have
been
educated
by
relations
or
have
practically
paid
for
themselves
by
scholarships
three
out
of
four
of
us
have
people
who
are
more
in
need
of
help
than
able
to
give
it
i
give
my
own
mother
thirty
pounds
a
year
so
we
are
practically
on
the
same
salary
have
a
home
where
you
can
spend
your
holiday
holidays
run
away
terribly
with
your
money
they
come
to
nearly
four
months
in
the
year
for
the
first
time
those
prolonged
holidays
appeared
to
claire
as
a
privilege
which
had
its
reverse
side
friends
in
brussels
might
possibly
house
her
for
two
or
three
weeks
she
could
not
expect
she
would
not
wish
them
to
do
more
and
at
the
end
there
would
still
remain
over
three
months
it
was
a
new
and
disagreeable
experience
to
look
forward
to
holidays
with
for
a
whole
two
minutes
she
looked
thoroughly
depressed
then
her
invincible
optimism
came
to
the
top
and
she
cried
triumphantly
i
take
a
holiday
engagement
the
english
mistress
shook
her
head
that
fatal
i
tried
it
myself
one
summer
went
with
a
family
to
the
seaside
and
was
expected
to
play
games
with
the
children
all
day
long
and
coach
them
in
the
evening
i
began
the
term
tired
out
and
nearly
collapsed
before
the
end
teaching
is
work
and
if
you
do
get
a
good
spell
off
it
as
bad
for
the
pupils
as
yourself
you
snap
their
heads
off
for
the
smallest
trifle
besides
it
folly
to
wear
oneself
out
any
sooner
than
one
need
it
bad
enough
to
think
of
the
time
when
one
has
to
retire
that
the
nightmare
which
haunts
us
more
and
more
every
year
do
you
think
when
the
time
comes
you
will
be
to
rest
asked
innocent
claire
whereupon
miss
rhodes
glared
at
her
with
indignant
eyes
we
should
be
glad
to
rest
no
doubt
but
we
do
exactly
appreciate
the
prospect
of
resting
in
the
workhouse
and
it
difficult
to
see
where
else
some
of
us
are
to
go
there
is
no
pension
for
high
mistresses
and
we
are
bound
to
retire
at
if
we
can
manage
to
stick
it
out
so
long
seems
a
long
way
off
to
you
not
quite
so
long
to
me
when
you
reach
forty
it
becomes
to
feel
quite
near
women
are
horribly
so
the
probability
is
that
we
live
on
to
eighty
or
more
years
after
leaving
off
work
and
is
the
money
to
come
from
to
keep
that
the
question
which
haunts
us
all
when
we
look
into
our
and
find
that
with
all
our
pains
we
have
only
been
able
to
save
at
the
utmost
two
or
three
hundred
pounds
claire
looked
scared
but
she
recovered
her
composure
with
a
swiftness
which
her
companion
had
no
difficulty
in
understanding
she
pounced
upon
her
with
lightning
swiftness
ah
you
think
you
get
married
and
escape
that
way
we
all
do
when
we
new
and
pretty
and
ignorant
of
the
life
but
it
fifty
to
one
my
dear
that
you
you
wo
meet
many
men
for
one
thing
and
if
you
do
they
do
like
does
that
depend
a
good
deal
on
the
kind
of
absolutely
but
after
a
few
years
we
are
all
more
or
less
alike
we
do
by
being
dowdy
and
angular
and
dogmatic
and
prudish
we
begin
by
being
pretty
and
cheerful
like
you
i
used
to
change
my
blouse
every
evening
and
put
on
silk
stockings
do
you
now
i
do
why
should
i
to
sit
over
a
table
correcting
exercises
till
ten
it
not
worth
the
trouble
besides
too
tired
and
it
wears
out
another
blouse
claire
attention
was
diverted
from
clothes
by
the
shock
of
the
reference
to
evening
work
she
had
looked
forward
to
coming
home
to
read
an
interesting
book
or
be
lazy
in
whatever
fashion
appealed
to
her
most
and
the
corrections
of
exercises
seemed
of
all
things
the
most
dull
shall
i
have
evening
work
too
she
inquired
blankly
and
miss
rhodes
laughed
with
brutal
enjoyment
rather
french
compositions
on
the
attributes
of
a
true
woman
or
did
you
spend
your
summer
holiday
with
all
the
tenses
wrong
and
the
idioms
translated
word
for
word
and
every
essay
a
practical
repetition
of
the
one
before
it
not
once
in
a
blue
moon
that
one
comes
across
a
girl
with
any
originality
of
thought
oh
yes
the
way
we
shall
spend
five
evenings
a
week
you
will
sit
at
that
side
of
the
table
i
will
sit
at
this
and
we
correct
and
yawn
and
yawn
and
correct
and
drink
a
cup
of
cocoa
and
go
to
bed
at
ten
lively
is
it
awful
i
never
thought
of
homework
but
if
saturday
is
a
whole
holiday
there
will
still
be
one
night
off
i
shall
make
a
point
of
doing
something
exciting
every
saturday
evening
exciting
things
cost
money
and
as
a
rule
when
you
have
paid
up
the
various
extras
there
no
money
to
spare
i
stay
in
bed
till
ten
on
saturday
and
then
get
up
and
wash
blouses
and
do
my
mending
and
have
a
nap
after
lunch
and
if
it
summer
go
and
sit
on
a
penny
chair
in
the
park
or
take
a
walk
over
hampstead
heath
in
the
evening
i
read
a
novel
and
have
a
hot
bath
once
in
a
blue
moon
i
have
an
extravagant
bout
and
lunch
in
a
restaurant
and
go
to
an
entertainment
but
i
sorry
afterwards
when
i
count
the
cost
on
sunday
i
go
to
church
and
wish
some
one
would
ask
me
to
tea
they
do
you
know
they
may
do
once
or
twice
when
you
first
come
up
but
you
can
never
ask
them
back
and
your
clothes
get
shabby
and
you
know
nothing
about
their
interests
so
they
think
you
a
bore
and
quietly
let
you
drop
a
smothered
exclamation
burst
from
claire
lips
with
a
sudden
swirling
movement
she
leapt
up
and
fell
on
her
knees
before
miss
rhodes
chair
her
hands
clasping
its
arms
her
flushed
face
upturned
with
a
desperate
eagerness
miss
rhodes
we
are
going
to
live
together
here
we
are
going
to
share
the
same
room
and
the
same
meals
would
you
if
any
one
offered
you
a
million
pounds
would
you
agree
to
poison
me
slowly
day
by
day
dropping
little
drops
of
poison
into
everything
i
ate
and
everything
i
drank
while
you
sat
by
and
watched
me
grow
weaker
and
weaker
till
i
good
heavens
girl
are
you
mad
what
in
the
world
are
you
raving
about
miss
rhodes
had
grown
quite
red
she
was
indignant
she
was
also
more
than
a
little
scared
the
girl
sudden
change
of
mood
was
startling
in
itself
and
she
looked
so
tense
so
overwhelmingly
in
earnest
what
could
she
mean
was
it
possible
that
she
was
a
little
i
suppose
you
do
realise
it
but
it
insulting
even
to
put
such
a
question
but
you
doing
it
it
just
exactly
what
you
are
beginning
already
ever
since
i
arrived
you
been
poisoning
me
drop
by
drop
poisoning
my
i
am
at
the
beginning
of
my
work
and
you
been
discouraging
me
frightening
me
painting
it
all
black
every
word
that
you
said
has
been
a
drop
of
poison
to
kill
hope
and
courage
and
confidence
and
oh
do
do
it
do
go
on
i
may
be
young
and
foolish
and
full
of
ridiculous
ideas
but
let
me
keep
them
as
long
as
i
can
if
all
that
you
say
is
true
they
will
be
knocked
out
of
me
soon
enough
and
i
i
never
had
to
work
before
or
been
alone
and
and
it
only
two
days
since
my
mother
left
me
to
go
to
india
all
that
long
way
and
left
me
behind
it
hard
enough
to
go
on
being
alone
and
believing
it
all
going
to
be
de
but
it
will
be
fifty
times
harder
if
i
do
please
please
do
make
it
any
worse
with
the
last
words
tears
came
with
a
rush
the
tears
that
had
been
resolutely
restrained
throughout
the
strain
of
the
last
week
claire
dropped
her
head
on
the
nearest
she
could
find
which
happened
to
be
miss
rhodes
blue
serge
lap
and
felt
the
quick
pressure
of
a
hand
over
the
glossy
coils
poor
little
girl
said
the
english
mistress
softly
poor
little
girl
i
sorry
i
a
beast
take
no
notice
of
me
i
a
sour
disagreeable
old
thing
it
was
more
than
half
jealousy
dear
because
you
looked
so
pretty
and
spry
so
like
what
i
used
to
look
myself
the
life
all
right
if
you
keep
well
and
do
worry
too
much
ahead
there
do
cry
i
loathe
tears
you
will
yourself
when
you
have
to
deal
with
silly
hysterical
girls
come
i
promise
i
wo
poison
you
any
more
at
least
i
do
my
best
but
i
a
grumbling
nature
and
you
better
realise
it
once
for
all
and
take
no
notice

on
all
right
i
like
you
i
glad
you
came
my
good
girl
if
you
do
stop
i
shake
you
till
you
do
claire
sat
back
on
her
heels
mopped
her
eyes
and
gave
a
strangled
laugh
i
hate
crying
myself
but
i
begin
again
on
the
faintest
provocation
it
always
like
that
with
me
i
hardly
ever
cry
but
when
i
once
begin
miss
rhodes
rose
with
an
air
of
determination
we
better
go
out
i
am
free
till
i
take
you
round
and
show
you
the
neighbourhood
and
the
usual
places
of
call
it
will
save
time
another
day
anything
you
want
to
buy
claire
mopped
away
another
tear
she
said
feebly
a
machine
chapter
six
the
invitation
the
next
morning
claire
was
introduced
to
the
scene
of
her
new
labours
and
was
agreeably
impressed
with
its
outside
appearance
saint
cuthbert
high
school
was
situated
in
a
handsome
thoroughfare
and
had
originally
been
a
large
private
house
to
which
long
wings
had
been
added
to
right
and
left
on
each
side
and
across
the
road
were
handsome
private
houses
standing
in
their
own
grounds
owned
by
tenants
who
regarded
the
high
school
with
lively
detestation
and
would
have
borne
up
with
equanimity
had
an
earthquake
swallowed
it
root
and
branch
viewed
from
inside
the
building
was
less
attractive
passages
and
alike
having
the
air
of
bleak
austerity
which
seems
inseparable
from
such
buildings
but
when
nine
struck
and
the
flood
of
young
life
went
trooping
up
the
stairways
and
flowed
into
the
separate
rooms
the
sense
of
bareness
was
replaced
by
one
of
tingling
vitality
as
is
usual
on
an
opening
day
every
girl
was
at
her
best
and
brightest
decked
in
a
new
blouse
with
pigtails
fastened
by
crisp
new
ribbons
and
good
resolutions
wound
up
to
fever
point
to
find
a
new
french
mistress
in
the
shape
of
a
pretty
girl
who
was
english
at
one
moment
and
at
the
next
even
frenchier
than
mademoiselle
was
an
unexpected
joy
and
claire
found
the
battery
of
admiring
young
eyes
an
embarrassing
if
stimulating
experience
following
miss
farnborough
advice
she
spent
the
first
day
lessons
in
questioning
the
different
classes
as
to
their
past
work
and
so
turned
the
hour
into
an
impromptu
conversation
class
the
ugly
english
accents
made
her
wince
and
she
winced
a
second
time
as
she
realised
the
unpleasant
fact
that
just
as
her
pupils
would
have
to
prepare
for
her
so
would
she
be
obliged
to
prepare
for
them
forgotten
rules
of
grammar
must
be
looked
up
and
memorised
for
french
was
so
much
her
mother
tongue
that
she
would
find
it
difficult
to
explain
distinctions
which
came
as
a
matter
of
course
that
meant
more
work
at
night
more
infringement
of
holiday
hours
the
girls
themselves
were
for
the
most
part
agreeable
and
the
majority
were
the
daughters
of
professional
men
and
of
folks
of
limited
means
but
there
was
also
a
sprinkling
of
the
daughters
of
artisans
who
paid
high
school
fees
at
a
cost
of
much
in
order
to
train
their
girls
for
teachers
posts
in
the
future
here
and
there
an
awkward
child
was
plainly
of
a
still
lower
class
these
were
the
free
places
clever
children
who
had
obtained
scholarships
from
primary
schools
and
were
undergoing
the
ordeal
of
being
snubbed
by
their
new
as
a
consequence
of
their
success
from
the
teacher
point
of
view
these
clever
children
were
a
welcome
stimulus
but
class
feeling
is
still
too
strong
in
england
to
make
them
acceptable
to
their
companions
at
the
fifteen
mistresses
assembled
in
the
a
dull
apartment
far
too
small
for
the
purpose
a
common
fault
in
high
schools
where
the
different
governing
bodies
are
apt
to
spare
no
expense
in
providing
for
the
comfort
of
the
scholar
but
grudge
the
slightest
expenditure
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
teach
fifteen
mistresses
sat
round
the
table
eating
roast
lamb
and
boiled
cabbage
followed
by
rhubarb
pie
and
rice
pudding
and
claire
looking
from
one
to
the
other
acknowledged
the
truth
of
miss
rhodes
assertion
that
they
were
all
of
a
type
she
herself
was
the
only
one
of
the
number
who
had
any
pretensions
to
roundness
of
outline
all
the
rest
were
thin
to
angularity
half
the
number
wore
or
spectacles
and
all
had
the
same
strained
pucker
round
the
eyes
each
one
wore
a
blue
serge
skirt
and
a
white
blouse
and
carried
herself
with
an
air
of
dogmatic
assurance
as
who
should
say
i
know
better
than
any
one
else
and
when
i
speak
let
no
dog
bark
the
german
mistress
was
the
veteran
of
the
party
and
was
probably
a
good
miss
bryce
the
froebel
mistress
paired
with
claire
herself
for
the
place
of
junior
miss
blake
the
gym
mistress
was
a
graceful
girl
with
an
air
of
delicacy
which
did
not
seem
in
accord
with
her
profession
miss
rose
the
art
mistress
was
plain
with
a
squat
awkward
figure
rising
from
the
table
claire
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
own
reflection
in
the
strip
of
mirror
over
the
and
at
the
sight
a
little
thrill
passed
through
her
veins
the
soft
bloom
of
her
complexion
the
dainty
finish
of
her
dress
differentiated
her
almost
painfully
from
her
companions
and
she
felt
a
pang
of
dread
lest
that
difference
should
ever
grow
less
while
she
affected
to
read
one
of
the
magazines
which
lay
on
a
side
table
she
was
really
occupied
making
a
number
of
vehement
resolutions
never
to
slack
in
her
care
of
her
personal
appearance
never
to
give
up
brushing
her
hair
at
night
never
to
wear
a
flannel
blouse
never
to
give
up
manicuring
her
hands
never
no
never
to
allow
herself
to
grow
and
be
obliged
to
submit
to
specs
the
different
mistresses
seemed
to
be
on
friendly
terms
but
there
was
an
absence
of
the
camaraderie
which
comes
from
living
under
the
same
roof
school
was
a
common
possession
but
home
hours
were
spent
apart
except
when
as
in
claire
own
case
two
mistresses
shared
the
same
rooms
and
it
followed
as
a
matter
of
course
that
personal
interests
were
divided
the
conversation
was
less
scholastic
than
usual
the
intervening
holidays
forming
a
topic
of
interest
the
art
mistress
had
been
on
a
bicycle
sketching
tour
with
a
friend
the
german
mistress
had
taken
a
cheap
trip
home
miss
blake
announced
that
all
her
money
had
gone
on
hateful
massage
and
the
faces
of
her
listeners
sobered
as
they
listened
for
sophy
blake
who
led
the
exercises
with
such
verve
and
go
had
of
late
complained
of
rheumatic
pains
and
her
companions
heard
of
her
symptoms
with
dread
what
would
become
of
sophy
if
those
pains
increased
one
after
another
the
mistresses
drifted
over
to
where
claire
sat
turning
the
pages
of
her
magazine
and
exchanged
a
few
fragments
of
conversation
and
then
the
great
bell
clanged
again
and
afternoon
school
began
the
first
of
afternoon
school
proved
the
most
trying
of
the
day
claire
was
tired
after
the
exertions
of
the
morning
and
a
very
passion
for
sleep
consumed
her
being
she
fought
against
it
with
all
her
might
but
the
yawns
would
come
she
fought
against
the
yawns
and
the
tears
flowed
to
her
horror
the
infection
spread
and
the
girls
began
to
yawn
in
their
turn
with
long
uncontrolled
gapes
it
was
a
junior
class
and
the
new
mistress
shrewdly
suspected
that
the
infection
was
welcomed
as
an
agreeable
interlude
it
was
obvious
that
she
could
not
afford
to
reject
that
cup
of
coffee
good
or
bad
it
must
be
drunk
rich
or
poor
that
penny
must
be
dedicated
to
the
task
of
vitalising
that
first
hour
of
sleepiness
at
the
end
of
six
weeks
claire
felt
as
though
she
had
been
a
high
all
her
life
the
regular
methodical
days
in
which
every
hour
was
mapped
out
had
a
deadening
effect
on
one
who
had
been
used
to
constant
variety
and
except
for
a
difference
in
the
arrangement
of
classes
there
seemed
no
distinction
between
one
and
the
other
she
was
a
machine
wound
up
to
work
steadily
from
monday
morning
until
friday
night
and
absurdly
ready
to
run
down
when
the
time
was
over
every
morning
after
breakfast
she
started
forth
with
miss
rhodes
by
foot
if
the
weather
were
fine
by
tube
if
wet
every
she
dined
in
the
with
the
fifteen
other
mistresses
and
gulped
down
a
cup
of
chicory
coffee
at
four
the
mistresses
met
once
more
for
tea
a
free
meal
this
time
supplemented
by
an
occasional
cake
which
one
of
the
fifteen
provided
for
the
general
good
at
five
she
and
her
table
companion
returned
to
their
rooms
and
rested
an
hour
before
taking
the
evening
meal
claire
was
sufficiently
french
to
be
intolerant
of
badly
cooked
food
and
instead
of
resigning
herself
to
eat
and
grumble
after
the
usual
habit
of
dwellers
resolutely
set
to
work
to
improve
the
situation
the
coffee
machine
had
now
a
as
companion
and
it
was
a
delightful
change
of
work
to
set
the
two
machines
to
work
to
provide
a
dainty
meal
high
tea
consisted
as
a
rule
of
coffee
and
some
light
dish
the
materials
for
which
were
purchased
on
the
way
home
on
hungry
days
when
work
had
been
unusually
trying
the
butcher
supplied
cutlets
which
were
grilled
with
tomatoes
or
an
occasional
quarter
of
a
pound
of
mushrooms
on
economical
days
the
humble
kipper
legendary
food
of
all
spinsters
in
lodgings
was
transformed
into
quite
a
smart
and
dish
separated
from
its
bones
pounded
with
butter
and
flavouring
and
served
in
neat
little
mounds
on
the
top
of
hot
buttered
toast
moreover
claire
was
a
proficient
in
the
making
of
omelettes
and
it
was
astonishing
how
large
and
tempting
a
dish
could
be
compounded
of
two
eggs
and
the
minutest
scrap
of
ham
left
over
from
the
breakfast
every
luxury
of
the
season
with
the
smell
thrown
in
in
cooking
the
smell
is
almost
the
best
part
all
the
cedars
in
lebanon
would
smell
as
good
at
this
moment
as
this
nice
frizzle
claire
declared
one
friday
evening
as
she
served
the
meal
on
plates
and
glowed
with
delight
at
her
own
sleight
of
hand
do
you
admire
eggs
for
looking
so
small
when
they
possess
such
powers
of
expansion
all
the
result
of
beating
might
make
a
simile
out
of
that
might
you
might
but
wo
the
english
teacher
replied
sipping
luxuriously
at
her
coffee
i
not
a
teacher
any
more
at
this
moment
i
a
gourmand
pure
and
simple
and
i
stay
a
gourmand
straight
on
till
this
omelette
is
finished
when
all
trades
fail
you
might
go
out
as
a
missioner
to
women
living
in
diggings
and
teach
them
how
to
prepare
their
meals
and
sell
by
instalment
payments
at
the
door
as
the
touts
sell
sewing
machines
to
the
maids
it
would
be
a
noble
vocation
claire
smirked
complacently
i
flatter
myself
i
made
a
difference
to
your
material
comfort
poor
we
may
be
but
we
do
have
nice
dainty
little
meals
and
there
no
reason
why
every
woman
should
have
them
at
the
same
cost
i
just
remembered
another
nice
dish
we
have
it
night
she
paused
and
a
wistful
look
came
into
her
eyes
for
the
next
day
was
saturday
and
it
was
on
holiday
afternoons
that
the
feeling
of
loneliness
grew
most
acute
school
life
was
monotonous
but
it
was
never
lonely
from
morning
to
night
one
lived
in
a
crowd
and
already
each
class
had
furnished
youthful
adorers
eager
to
sit
at
the
feet
of
the
pretty
new
mistress
and
bring
her
offerings
of
chocolates
and
flowers
for
five
long
days
there
was
always
a
crowd
always
a
hum
and
babble
of
voices
but
at
the
end
of
the
week
came
a
dead
calm
on
the
first
saturday
of
the
term
miss
farnborough
had
invited
the
new
french
mistress
to
tea
and
had
been
all
that
was
friendly
and
encouraging
but
since
that
time
no
word
had
passed
between
them
that
was
not
strictly
concerned
with
the
work
in
hand
and
claire
realised
that
as
one
out
of
sixteen
mistresses
she
could
not
hope
for
frequent
invitations
on
one
sunday
the
gym
mistress
had
offered
her
company
for
a
walk
and
there
the
list
of
hospitalities
ceased
no
invitations
came
from
that
friend
of
mrs
fanshawe
who
was
so
fond
of
girls
who
were
working
for
themselves
claire
had
hardly
expected
it
but
she
was
disappointed
all
the
same
a
longing
was
growing
within
her
to
sit
again
in
a
pretty
room
and
talk
about
something
else
than
and
irregular
verbs
and
the
association
of
assistant
mistresses
which
amalgamated
with
the
association
of
assistant
masters
and
the
guild
were
labouring
to
obtain
a
settled
scale
of
salaries
and
that
great
safeguard
desired
above
all
others
a
pension
on
retirement
on
this
particular
friday
evening
the
longing
was
so
strong
that
she
had
deliberately
gone
out
of
her
way
to
try
to
gain
an
invitation
by
walking
home
with
a
certain
flora
ross
in
the
sixth
form
who
was
the
most
ardent
of
her
admirers
flora
lived
in
a
house
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
school
and
every
morning
hung
over
the
gate
waiting
for
the
chance
occasions
when
her
beloved
miss
gifford
approached
alone
and
she
could
have
the
felicity
of
accompanying
her
for
the
rest
of
the
way
on
these
occasions
she
invariably
turned
to
wave
her
hand
to
a
plump
smiling
mother
who
stood
at
a
bay
window
waving
in
return
an
upper
window
was
barred
with
brass
rods
against
which
two
little
flaxen
heads
bobbed
up
and
down
both
the
house
and
its
inmates
had
a
cheerful
wholesome
air
which
made
a
strong
appeal
to
the
heart
of
the
lonely
girl
and
this
friday
afternoon
meeting
flora
waiting
in
the
corridor
she
had
accepted
her
companionship
on
the
way
home
with
a
lurking
hope
that
when
the
green
gate
was
reached
she
would
be
invited
to
come
inside
alas
no
such
thought
seemed
to
enter
flora
brain
she
gazed
adoringly
into
claire
face
and
hung
breathlessly
on
her
words
but
for
all
her
adoration
there
was
a
gulf
between
claire
was
the
sweetest
and
duckiest
of
mistresses
but
she
a
mistress
a
being
shut
off
from
the
ordinary
interests
of
life
when
flora
said
is
it
jolly
we
are
going
to
have
a
musical
party
we
have
such
lovely
parties
and
mother
always
lets
me
sit
up
she
might
have
been
speaking
to
a
creature
without
ears
for
all
the
consciousness
she
exhibited
that
claire
might
possibly
wish
to
take
part
in
the
fray
when
the
green
gate
was
reached
the
plump
mamma
was
seen
standing
outside
the
room
window
and
recognising
the
identity
of
her
daughter
companion
she
bent
her
head
in
a
courteous
bow
but
she
made
no
attempt
to
approach
the
gate
see
you
on
monday
cried
flora
fondly
then
the
gate
clicked
and
claire
walked
along
the
road
with
her
head
held
high
and
two
red
spots
burning
on
either
cheek
that
evening
for
the
first
time
she
felt
a
disinclination
to
change
into
the
pretty
summer
frock
which
she
had
chosen
as
a
compromise
for
evening
dress
that
evening
for
the
first
time
the
inner
voice
whispered
to
her
as
it
had
done
to
so
many
before
her
what
the
good
nobody
sees
you
nobody
cares
miss
rhodes
finished
her
share
of
the
omelette
turned
on
to
bread
and
jam
and
cast
a
glance
of
inquiry
at
her
companion
who
had
relapsed
into
unusual
silence
anything
wrong
yes
i
think
so
usual
symptoms
i
suppose
i
want
to
wear
all
my
best
clothes
and
go
out
to
do
something
gay
and
exciting
cecil
the
english
teacher
name
being
rhodes
it
was
obvious
that
she
should
be
addressed
as
cecil
especially
as
her
parents
had
been
misguided
enough
to
give
her
the
unsuitably
gentle
name
of
mary
cecil
do
none
of
the
parents
ask
us
out
why
should
they
why
should
they
if
we
are
good
enough
to
teach
their
children
we
are
good
enough
for
them
if
they
are
interested
in
their
welfare
they
ought
to
make
a
point
of
knowing
us
to
see
what
kind
of
influence
we
use
quite
so
well
well
my
dear
there
only
one
thing
to
be
said
they
as
i
told
you
before
there
a
prejudice
against
mistresses
they
give
us
credit
for
being
clever
and
cultivated
and
but
they
never
grasp
the
fact
that
we
are
human
girls
who
would
very
much
enjoy
being
frivolous
for
a
change
i
been
asked
out
to
tea
at
rare
intervals
and
the
mothers
have
apologised
for
the
ordinary
conversation
and
laboriously
switched
it
on
to
books
i
did
want
to
talk
books
i
wanted
to
discuss
hats
and
dresses
and
fashionable
intelligence
and
sing
comic
songs
and
play
and
be
generally
giddy
and
riotous
but
my
presence
cast
a
wet
blanket
over
the
whole
party
and
we
discussed
science
and
art
now
i
old
and
resigned
but
it
hard
on
the
new
hands
i
think
it
was
rather
brutal
of
your
mother
to
let
you
come
to
london
without
taking
the
trouble
of
getting
introductions
do
mind
me
saying
so
do
you
claire
smiled
feebly
you
have
said
it
anyhow
i
know
it
must
seem
unkind
to
anyone
who
does
not
know
mother
she
really
the
kindest
person
in
the
world
but
she
very
and
apt
to
believe
that
everything
will
happen
just
as
she
wishes
she
felt
quite
sure
that
miss
farnborough
and
the
staff
would
supply
me
with
a
whirl
of
gaiety
there
one
lady
who
said
she
would
write
to
a
friend
cecil
groaned
deeply
i
know
that
friend
she
comes
from
sheffield
a
dear
kind
friend
who
would
love
to
have
you
out
on
holidays
a
friend
who
takes
a
special
interest
in
a
friend
who
gives
such
nice
ing
parties
and
would
certainly
send
you
a
card
if
she
knew
your
address
was
that
it
my
dear
was
that
the
kind
of
friend
cecil
chuckled
with
triumph
at
the
sight
of
claire
lengthening
jaw
in
truth
there
seemed
something
uncanny
in
so
accurate
a
reproduction
of
mrs
fanshawe
description
was
there
indeed
no
such
person
did
she
exist
purely
as
a
dummy
figure
to
be
dangled
before
the
eyes
of
credulous
beginners
claire
sighed
and
buried
her
last
lingering
hope
and
at
that
very
moment
the
postman
rap
sounded
at
the
door
and
a
square
white
envelope
was
handed
in
addressed
in
feminine
handwriting
to
miss
claire
gifford
claire
tore
it
open
pulled
forth
a
white
card
gasped
and
flushed
and
tossed
it
across
the
table
with
a
whoop
of
triumph
raven
look
at
that
what
do
you
think
now
of
your
melancholy
croaks
cecil
picked
up
the
card
inscribed
with
the
orthodox
printed
lines
beneath
which
a
few
words
had
been
written
mrs
willoughby
at
home
may
music
have
just
received
your
address
from
mrs
fanshawe
shall
hope
to
see
you
cecil
screwed
up
her
face
in
disparagement
nine
mayfair
that
means
a
taxi
both
ways
ca
arrive
at
a
house
like
that
in
a
mackintosh
with
your
shoes
in
a
bag
much
wiser
to
refuse
it
will
only
unsettle
you
and
make
you
unfit
for
work
she
done
the
polite
thing
for
once
because
she
was
asked
but
never
do
it
again
i
been
through
it
myself
and
i
know
the
ropes
a
woman
like
that
has
hundreds
of
friends
why
should
she
bother
about
you
you
never
be
asked
again
but
at
that
claire
laughed
and
beat
her
hand
on
the
table
but
i
say
i
shall
i
say
i
be
asked
i
do
care
if
you
had
a
hundred
experiences
mine
shall
be
different
she
has
asked
me
once
now
as
the
yankees
say
up
to
me
to
do
the
rest
i
make
up
my
mind
to
make
her
to
ask
me
chapter
seven
transformation
of
cecil
in
the
days
to
come
when
claire
looked
back
and
reviewed
the
course
of
events
which
followed
she
realised
that
mrs
willoughby
invitation
had
been
a
from
which
to
date
happenings
to
others
as
well
as
herself
it
was
for
instance
on
the
morning
after
its
arrival
that
cecil
chronic
discontent
reached
an
acute
stage
she
appeared
at
breakfast
with
a
clouded
face
grumbled
incessantly
throughout
the
meal
and
snapped
at
everything
claire
said
until
the
latter
was
provoked
into
snapping
in
return
in
the
old
days
of
idleness
claire
had
been
noted
for
the
sunny
sweetness
of
her
disposition
but
she
was
already
discovering
that
teaching
lays
a
severe
strain
on
the
nerves
and
at
the
end
of
a
week
work
endurance
seemed
at
its
lowest
ebb
so
when
her
soft
answers
met
rebuff
after
rebuff
she
began
to
grumble
in
her
turn
and
to
give
back
as
good
as
she
got
really
cecil
i
am
exceedingly
sorry
that
your
form
is
so
stupid
and
your
work
so
hard
but
i
am
neither
a
pupil
nor
a
chief
so
i
fail
to
see
where
my
responsibility
comes
in
would
it
be
better
if
you
interviewed
miss
farnborough
instead
of
me
it
was
the
first
time
that
claire
had
answered
sharply
and
for
the
moment
surprise
held
cecil
dumb
then
the
colour
flamed
into
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
sparkled
with
anger
though
forbearance
had
failed
to
soothe
her
opposition
evidently
added
fuel
to
the
fire
miss
farnborough
she
repeated
jeeringly
what
does
miss
farnborough
care
for
the
welfare
of
her
mistresses
so
long
as
they
grind
through
their
daily
tasks
it
is
the
pupils
she
thinks
about
not
us
the
pupils
who
are
to
be
pampered
and
considered
and
studied
and
amused
in
school
and
out
they
have
to
have
games
in
summer
and
a
mistress
has
to
give
up
her
spare
time
to
watch
the
pretty
dears
to
see
that
they
do
get
into
trouble
and
they
must
have
parties
and
concerts
and
silly
entertainments
in
winter
with
some
poor
wretch
of
a
mistress
to
do
all
the
work
so
that
they
may
enjoy
the
fun
miss
farnborough
is
an
exemplary
head
so
far
as
her
scholars
are
concerned
but
what
does
she
do
for
her
mistresses
i
ask
you
does
she
do
anything
at
all
claire
considered
and
was
silent
her
first
term
was
nearly
over
and
she
could
not
truthfully
say
that
the
head
had
taken
any
concern
for
her
as
an
individual
who
might
be
expected
to
feel
some
interest
in
life
beyond
the
school
door
it
is
true
that
almost
every
day
brought
the
two
in
contact
for
the
exchange
of
a
few
words
which
if
strictly
on
business
were
always
pleasant
and
kindly
but
except
for
the
one
invitation
to
tea
on
the
day
before
work
began
they
had
never
met
out
of
school
hours
claire
was
a
stranger
in
london
yet
the
head
had
never
inquired
as
to
her
leisure
hours
never
invited
her
to
her
house
or
offered
her
an
introduction
to
friends
never
even
engaged
the
sympathies
of
other
mistresses
on
her
behalf
claire
had
expected
a
very
different
treatment
and
had
struggled
against
a
sense
of
injury
but
she
would
not
acknowledge
as
much
in
words
i
suppose
miss
farnborough
is
even
more
tired
than
we
are
she
has
a
tremendous
amount
of
responsibility
and
she
has
a
brother
and
sister
at
home
perhaps
they
object
to
an
incursion
of
school
in
free
hours
then
she
ought
to
leave
them
and
live
where
she
can
do
her
duty
without
interference
after
all
mistresses
are
girls
too
not
very
much
older
than
some
of
the
pupils
when
we
begin
work
it
inhuman
to
take
interest
in
our
welfare
it
would
kill
a
head
to
give
up
a
night
a
month
to
ask
us
to
meet
possible
friends
or
to
write
a
few
letters
of
introduction
you
agree
with
me
in
your
heart
so
it
no
use
pretending
it
a
moral
obligation
if
it
is
legal
and
i
say
part
of
the
responsibility
is
hers
if
things
go
wrong
it
inhuman
to
leave
a
young
girl
alone
in
lodgings
without
even
troubling
to
inquire
if
she
has
anywhere
to
go
in
her
leisure
hours
but
it
the
same
tale
all
round
nobody
thinks
nobody
cares
i
gone
to
the
same
church
for
three
years
and
not
a
soul
has
spoken
to
me
all
that
time
i
no
time
to
give
to
church
work
and
the
seats
are
free
so
there
no
way
of
getting
into
touch
i
do
suppose
any
one
has
ever
noticed
the
shabby
in
her
shabby
blue
serge
suddenly
mary
rhodes
thrust
back
her
chair
and
rising
impetuously
began
to
storm
up
and
down
the
room
oh
i
tired
i
tired
of
this
life
living
in
other
people
houses
teaching
other
people
children
obeying
other
people
orders
i
sick
of
it
i
ca
stand
it
a
moment
longer
i
rather
take
any
risk
to
be
out
of
it
after
all
what
could
be
worse
any
sort
of
life
lived
on
one
own
must
be
better
than
this
nearly
twelve
years
of
it
and
if
i
have
twenty
more
what
the
end
what
is
there
to
look
forward
to
slow
starvation
in
a
room
for
perhaps
thirty
years
i
wo
do
it
i
wo
i
had
enough
now
i
shall
choose
for
myself
like
a
whirlwind
she
dashed
out
of
the
room
and
claire
put
her
elbow
on
the
table
and
leant
her
head
on
her
hands
feeling
shaken
and
discouraged
and
oppressed
for
the
first
time
a
doubt
entered
her
mind
as
to
whether
she
could
continue
to
live
with
mary
rhodes
in
her
brighter
modes
there
was
much
that
was
attractive
in
her
personality
but
to
live
with
a
chronic
grumbler
sapped
one
own
powers
of
resistance
claire
felt
that
for
the
sake
of
her
own
happiness
and
efficiency
it
would
be
wiser
to
make
a
change
but
her
heart
sank
at
the
thought
of
making
a
fresh
start
of
perhaps
having
to
live
alone
with
no
one
to
speak
to
in
the
long
evenings
the
life
of
a
bachelor
girl
made
little
appeal
at
that
moment
liberty
seemed
dearly
bought
at
the
price
of
companionship
claire
spent
the
morning
writing
to
her
mother
and
reading
over
the
series
of
happy
letters
which
had
reached
her
week
after
week
mrs
judge
was
in
radiant
spirits
delighted
with
the
conditions
of
her
new
life
full
of
praise
of
her
husband
and
the
many
friends
to
whom
she
had
been
introduced
of
the
letter
were
taken
up
with
descriptions
of
her
own
gay
doings
the
remaining
fourth
with
optimistic
remarks
on
her
daughter
life
how
delightful
to
share
rooms
with
another
girl
what
a
nice
break
to
have
every
saturday
and
sunday
free
what
economical
rooms
claire
must
feel
quite
rich
what
fun
to
have
the
girls
so
devoted
claire
made
an
expressive
grimace
as
she
read
that
quite
rich
this
last
week
she
had
been
obliged
to
buy
new
gloves
and
to
have
her
boots
mended
a
new
umbrella
had
been
torn
by
the
carelessness
with
which
another
teacher
had
thrust
her
own
into
the
crowded
stand
and
one
night
she
had
been
seized
with
a
longing
for
a
dainty
meal
and
had
recklessly
stood
treat
at
a
restaurant
she
did
not
feel
at
all
rich
as
she
made
up
the
week
account
and
reflected
that
next
week
the
expense
of
driving
to
mrs
willoughby
at
home
would
again
swell
up
the
total
of
these
exasperating
extras
which
made
such
havoc
of
advance
calculations
cecil
did
not
appear
until
lunch
was
on
the
table
when
she
flung
the
door
wide
open
and
marched
in
with
an
air
of
bravado
as
if
wanting
her
companion
to
stare
at
once
and
get
over
it
it
would
have
been
impossible
not
to
stare
for
the
change
in
her
appearance
was
positively
startling
to
behold
her
dark
hair
was
waved
and
fashionably
coiffed
her
best
coat
and
skirt
had
been
embellished
with
frills
of
lace
at
neck
and
sleeves
a
pretty
little
waistcoat
had
been
manufactured
out
of
a
length
of
blue
ribbon
and
a
few
paste
buttons
while
a
blue
feather
necklet
had
been
promoted
a
step
higher
and
encircled
an
old
straw
hat
the
ribbon
bow
at
the
end
of
the
boa
exactly
matched
the
shade
of
the
waistcoat
and
was
cocked
up
at
a
daring
angle
while
a
becoming
new
veil
and
a
pair
of
immaculate
new
gloves
added
still
further
to
the
effect
claire
had
always
suspected
that
cecil
could
be
pretty
if
she
chose
to
take
the
trouble
and
now
she
knew
it
for
a
fact
it
was
difficult
to
realise
that
this
girl
with
the
bright
eyes
and
cheeks
could
really
be
the
same
person
as
the
looking
individual
who
every
morning
hurried
along
the
street
involuntarily
claire
threw
up
her
hands
involuntarily
she
cried
aloud
in
delight
cheers
cheers
how
do
you
do
cecil
welcome
home
cecil
the
real
cecil
how
pretty
you
are
cecil
how
well
that
blue
suits
you
do
dare
to
go
back
to
your
dull
navy
and
black
i
shall
insist
that
you
always
wear
blue
i
feel
quite
proud
of
having
such
a
fine
lady
to
lunch
you
are
going
to
have
lunch
are
you
why
those
gloves
and
veil
oh
well
i
not
hungry
i
have
some
coffee
i
may
have
lunch
in
town
cecil
was
plainly
embarrassed
under
her
companion
scrutiny
she
pushed
up
her
veil
so
that
it
rested
in
a
little
ridge
across
her
nose
craned
forward
her
head
sipping
her
coffee
with
exaggerated
care
so
that
no
drop
should
fall
on
her
lacy
frills
claire
longed
to
ask
a
dozen
questions
but
something
in
cecil
manner
held
her
at
bay
and
she
contented
herself
with
one
inquiry
what
time
will
you
be
home
cecil
shrugged
her
shoulders
do
know
perhaps
not
till
late
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
added
with
sudden
bitterness
you
are
not
the
person
who
has
invitations
if
i
chose
i
could
go
out
every
saturday
then
why
on
earth
are
you
always
grumbling
about
your
loneliness
thought
claire
swiftly
but
she
did
not
put
the
thought
into
words
after
the
warmth
of
her
own
welcome
a
kinder
response
was
surely
her
due
she
was
angry
and
would
not
condescend
to
reply
the
meal
was
finished
in
silence
but
when
cecil
rose
to
depart
the
usual
compunction
seized
her
in
its
grip
she
stood
arranging
her
veil
before
the
mirror
over
the
mantelpiece
uttering
the
usual
interjectory
expressions
of
regret
sorry
claire
i
a
wretch
you
must
hate
me
i
ought
to
be
shot
nice
saturday
morning
i
given
you
what
are
you
going
to
do
this
afternoon
claire
eyes
turned
towards
the
window
with
an
expression
sad
to
see
on
so
young
a
face
an
imprisoned
look
her
voice
seemed
to
lose
all
its
timbre
as
she
replied
in
one
flat
dreary
word
nothing
a
spasm
of
irresolution
passed
across
cecil
face
for
a
moment
she
looked
as
if
she
were
about
to
throw
aside
her
own
project
and
cast
in
her
lot
with
her
friend
then
her
face
hardened
and
she
turned
towards
the
door
why
not
call
for
sophie
blake
and
see
if
she
will
go
a
walk
she
asked
you
once
before
with
that
she
was
gone
and
claire
was
left
to
consider
the
proposition
sophie
blake
the
games
mistress
was
the
single
member
of
the
staff
who
had
shown
any
disposition
towards
real
friendship
though
the
intimacy
was
so
far
confined
to
one
afternoon
walk
and
an
occasional
chat
in
the
dinner
hour
but
this
afternoon
the
thought
of
her
merry
smile
acted
as
an
irresistible
magnet
claire
ran
upstairs
to
get
ready
in
a
panic
lest
she
might
arrive
at
sophie
lodgings
to
find
she
had
already
gone
out
for
the
afternoon
cecil
had
hinted
that
she
might
not
return
until
late
and
suddenly
it
seemed
unbearable
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
in
solitude
restlessness
was
in
the
air
first
the
pleasurable
restlessness
caused
by
the
receipt
of
mrs
invitation
then
the
disagreeable
restlessness
caused
by
cecil
erratic
behaviour
as
she
hurried
through
the
streets
towards
sophie
lodgings
claire
pondered
over
the
mystery
of
this
sudden
development
on
cecil
part
where
was
she
going
whom
was
she
going
to
see
why
declare
with
one
breath
that
she
was
without
a
friend
and
with
the
next
that
if
she
chose
she
might
accept
invitations
every
week
what
special
reason
had
inspired
such
unusual
care
in
her
appearance
sophie
was
at
home
lonely
claire
felt
quite
a
throb
of
relief
as
she
heard
the
welcome
words
she
entered
the
passage
and
was
shown
into
a
small
very
warm
very
untidy
front
parlour
wherein
stood
sophie
herself
staring
with
widened
eyes
at
the
opening
door
oh
it
she
cried
what
a
fright
you
gave
me
i
think
it
could
be

rush

rheumatism
my
dear
cheerful
is
it
for
a
gym
mistress
been
giving
me
fits
all
the
week
the
east
winds
i
suppose
i
know
they
make
rheumatism
worse
they
do
so
does
damp
so
does
snow
so
does
fog
so
does
cold
so
does
heat
if
you
could
tell
me
of
anything
that
makes
it
be
obliged
bother
rheumatism
do
let
talk
of
it
saturday
my
dear
i
never
think
of
disagreeables
on
saturday
miss
rhodes
this
afternoon
i
do
know
she
made
herself
look
very
nice
and
smart
she
can
be
very
when
she
likes
and
went
out
for
the
day
humph
sophie
pursed
her
lips
and
contracted
her
brows
as
if
in
consideration
of
a
knotty
point
she
was
awfully
pretty
when
i
came
to
the
school
ten
years
ago
and
quite
jolly
and
bright
you
know
her
for
the
same
girl
she
a
worrier
of
course
but
it
more
than
that
something
happened
about
six
years
ago
which
took
the
starch
out
of
her
once
for
all
a
love
affair
i
expect
perhaps
told
you
i
not
fishing
and
it
not
my
business
but
i
sorry
for
the
poor
thing
and
i
was
sorry
for
you
when
i
heard
you
were
going
to
share
her
room
she
ca
be
the
most
cheerful
companion
in
the
world
oh
she
quite
lively
at
times
claire
said
loyally
and
very
appreciative
i
fond
of
her
you
know
but
i
wish
she
did
grumble
quite
so
much
she
looked
round
the
parlour
which
was
at
once
bigger
and
better
furnished
than
the
joint
apartment
in
laburnum
crescent
and
seized
upon
an
opportunity
of
changing
the
subject
you
have
a
very
nice
room
sophie
blake
looked
round
with
an
air
half
proud
half
guilty
too
nice
i
no
business
to
spend
so
much
but
i
simply
stand
those
dreadful
cheap
houses
people
are
always
fussing
and
telling
one
to
save
up
for
old
age
i
think
it
matters
far
more
to
have
things
nice
in
one
youth
i
get
a
hundred
and
thirty
a
year
and
have
to
keep
myself
all
the
year
round
and
help
to
educate
a
young
sister
we
are
orphans
and
the
have
to
keep
her
between
us
i
could
save
if
i
wanted
to
so
what
the
use
of
worrying
i
care
very
much
what
happens
after
perhaps
i
shall
be
married
perhaps
i
shall
be
dead
perhaps
some
nice
kind
millionaire
will
have
taken
a
fancy
to
me
and
left
me
a
fortune
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
i
go
into
a
home
for
decayed
gentlewomen
and
knit
stockings
no
not
stockings
i
should
never
be
able
to
turn
the
heels
long
armlet
things
like
mittens
without
the
thumbs
look
here
where
shall
we
go
is
it
a
shame
that
all
the
nice
shops
close
early
on
saturday
we
might
have
had
such
sport
walking
along
knightsbridge
choosing
what
we
like
best
from
every
window
have
you
ever
done
that
it
ripping
fun
what
about
museums
do
you
like
museums
rather
cold
for
the
feet
do
you
think
what
can
we
do
that
warm
and
interesting
and
exciting
and
does
cost
more
than
eighteenpence
claire
laughed
gleefully
not
at
the
thought
of
the
eighteenpenny
restriction
but
from
pure
joy
at
finding
a
companion
who
could
face
life
with
a
smile
and
find
enjoyment
from
such
simple
means
as
imaginary
purchases
from
shop
windows
oh
the
blessed
effect
of
a
cheerful
spirit
how
inspiriting
it
was
after
the
constant
douche
of
discouragement
from
which
she
had
suffered
for
the
last
nine
weeks
oh
bother
eighteenpence
this
is
my
treat
and
we
are
going
to
enjoy
ourselves
or
know
the
reason
why
i
got
a
lot
of
money
in
the
bank
and
i
just
in
the
mood
to
spend
we
go
to
the
queen
hall
and
then
on
to
have
tea
in
a
restaurant
you
would
like
to
hear
some
music
so
long
as
it
is
not
a
chorus
of
female
voices
i
i
a
trifle
fed
up
with
female
voices
cried
sophie
gaily
she
picked
up
her
hat
from
the
table
and
caressed
it
fondly
come
along
darling
you
going
to
make
your
chapter
eight
the
reception
it
was
almost
worth
while
leading
a
life
of
all
work
and
no
play
for
six
weeks
on
end
for
the
sheer
delight
of
being
frivolous
once
more
of
dressing
oneself
in
one
prettiest
frock
drawing
on
filmy
silk
stockings
and
golden
shoes
clasping
a
pearl
necklace
round
a
white
throat
and
cocking
a
feathery
aigrette
at
just
the
right
angle
among
coppery
swathes
of
hair
no
single
detail
was
wanting
to
complete
the
whole
for
in
the
old
careless
days
claire
garments
had
been
purchased
with
a
lavish
hand
the
only
anxiety
being
to
secure
the
most
becoming
specimen
of
its
kind
there
were
long
crinkly
gloves
and
a
lace
handkerchief
and
a
fan
composed
of
curling
feathers
and
sticks
and
a
dainty
bag
hanging
by
golden
cords
and
a
cloak
of
the
newest
shape
composed
of
layers
of
chiffons
which
looked
more
like
a
cloud
at
sunset
than
a
garment
manufactured
by
human
hands
and
supposed
to
be
of
use
claire
tilted
her
little
mirror
to
an
acute
angle
gave
a
little
skip
of
delight
as
she
surveyed
the
completed
whole
and
then
whirled
down
the
narrow
staircase
a
flying
mist
of
draperies
through
which
the
little
feet
gleamed
in
and
out
she
whirled
into
the
where
the
solitary
lamp
stood
on
the
table
and
cecil
lay
on
the
humpy
green
plush
sofa
reading
a
novel
from
the
free
library
she
put
down
the
book
and
stared
with
wide
eyes
as
claire
gave
an
extra
whirl
for
her
benefit
and
cried
jubilantly
admire
me
admire
me
i
dying
to
be
admired
do
i
look
fine
and
smart
and
unsuitable
will
any
one
in
the
world
mistake
me
for
a
high
cecil
rose
from
the
sofa
and
made
a
solemn
tour
of
inspection
obviously
she
was
impressed
obviously
she
admired
obviously
also
she
found
something
startling
in
her
inspection
there
was
pure
feminine
interest
in
the
manner
in
which
she
fingered
each
delicate
fabric
in
turn
there
was
pure
feminine
kindness
in
the
little
pat
on
the
arm
which
announced
the
close
of
the
inspection
my
dear
it
ripping
rich
and
rare
is
in
it
you
look
a
dream
poor
kiddie
if
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
you
been
used
to
been
harder
for
you
than
i
thought
yes
horribly
unsuitable
and
when
it
you
never
be
able
to
have
another
like
it
white
ponge
will
be
your
next
effort
bless
your
heart
i
three
others
just
as
fine
and
these
skimpy
skirts
last
for
an
age
no
chance
of
any
one
planting
a
great
foot
on
the
folds
and
tearing
them
to
ribbons
as
in
the
old
days
there
no
folds
to
tread
on
but
cecil
as
usual
was
ready
with
her
croak
next
year
she
said
darkly
there
will
be
flounces
before
you
have
a
chance
of
wearing
your
four
dresses
everybody
will
be
fussy
and
frilly
and
they
be
hopelessly
out
of
date
then
i
cut
up
two
and
turn
them
into
flounces
to
fuss
out
the
others
cried
claire
the
optimist
and
gave
another
caper
from
sheer
lightness
of
heart
how
do
you
like
my
feet
i
suppose
you
mean
shoes
a
pretty
price
you
paid
for
those
i
sure
they
too
tight
boats
my
dear
boats
i
had
to
put
in
a
sole
did
you
know
my
feet
were
so
small
how
do
you
like
my
cloak
it
meant
to
look
like
a
cloud
layers
of
blue
pink
and
grey
as
the
fashion
papers
have
it
or
should
you
say
it
was
more
like
an
opal
no
i
should
not
neither
one
nor
the
other
considered
as
a
cloak
for
a
foggy
november
evening
i
should
call
it
a
delusion
and
a
fraud
you
get
a
chill
i
a
shetland
shawl
i
lend
it
to
you
to
wrap
round
your
shoulders
no
you
wo
claire
cried
defiantly
shetland
shawl
indeed
who
ever
heard
of
a
girl
of
in
a
shetland
shawl
i
going
to
a
party
my
dear
the
joy
of
that
thought
would
keep
me
warm
through
a
dozen
fogs
you
have
to
come
back
from
the
party
however
and
you
may
feel
so
jubilant
then
it
not
too
exciting
when
you
do
know
a
soul
and
sit
on
one
seat
all
evening
i
knew
a
girl
who
went
to
a
big
crush
and
did
even
get
a
cup
of
coffee
nobody
asked
her
to
go
down
claire
swept
her
cloak
to
one
side
and
sat
down
on
a
chair
facing
the
sofa
her
white
gloves
clasped
on
her
knee
the
embroidered
bag
hanging
by
its
golden
cords
to
the
tip
of
the
golden
slippers
she
fixed
her
eyes
steadily
on
her
companion
and
there
was
in
them
a
spark
of
anger
before
which
cecil
had
the
grace
to
flush
sorry
really
i
am
sorry
is
to
the
sins
we
loved
before
and
show
that
we
in
earnest
grieve
by
doing
so
no
more
quoted
claire
sternly
really
cecil
you
are
the
champion
wet
blanket
of
your
age
it
is
too
bad
i
have
to
do
all
the
perking
up
and
you
ca
even
let
me
go
to
a
party
without
damping
my
ardour
i
was
thinking
it
over
the
other
night
and
i
hit
on
a
promising
plan
going
to
allow
you
a
grumble
day
a
week
but
only
one
on
that
day
you
can
grumble
as
much
as
ever
you
like
from
the
moment
you
get
up
till
the
moment
you
go
to
bed
you
be
within
your
rights
and
i
shall
not
complain
i
have
my
own
day
too
when
you
can
find
out
what
it
feels
like
to
listen
but
wo
be
allowed
to
say
a
word
in
return
for
the
rest
of
the
week
you
just
have
to
grin
and
bear
it
you
wo
be
allowed
a
single
growl
cecil
knitted
her
brows
and
looked
ashamed
and
uncomfortable
as
she
invariably
did
when
taxed
with
her
besetting
sin
claire
charge
on
mental
poisoning
had
struck
home
and
she
had
honestly
determined
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
but
the
habit
had
been
indulged
too
long
to
be
easily
abandoned
unconsciously
as
it
were
disparaging
remarks
flowed
from
her
lips
combined
with
a
steady
string
of
objections
adverse
criticisms
and
presentiments
of
darkness
and
gloom
at
the
present
moment
she
felt
a
little
startled
to
realise
how
firmly
the
habit
was
established
and
the
proposal
of
a
licenced
grumble
day
held
out
some
promise
of
a
cure
then
i
have
monday
she
cried
briskly
i
am
always
in
a
bad
temper
on
mondays
so
i
shall
be
able
to
make
the
most
of
my
chance
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
considering
the
prospect
then
was
struck
with
a
sudden
thought
but
now
and
then
i
have
a
nice
and
then
i
should
want
to
grumble
at
all
i
suppose
i
could
change
the
day
there
was
a
ring
of
triumph
in
claire
laugh
not
you
my
dear
girl
that
just
what
i
am
counting
upon
sometimes
the
sun
will
shine
sometimes
you
get
a
nice
letter
sometimes
the
girls
will
be
intelligent
and
interesting
and
then
my
dear
forget
and
the
day
will
skip
past
and
before
you
know
where
you
are
it
will
be
tuesday
morning
and
your
chance
will
have
gone
cecil
fancy
it
a
whole
fortnight
without
a
grumble
it
seems
almost
too
good
to
be
true
it
does
said
the
english
mistress
eloquently
she
sat
upright
on
the
green
plush
sofa
her
shabby
slippers
well
in
evidence
beneath
the
edge
of
her
shabby
skirt
staring
with
curious
eyes
at
the
radiant
figure
of
the
girl
in
the
opposite
chair
i
do
think
you
need
a
day
at
all
because
i
going
to
a
solitary
party
only
two
minutes
ago
my
love
you
were
sympathising
with
my
hard
lot
i
shall
have
fridays
tired
on
fridays
and
it
getting
near
the
time
for
making
up
accounts
i
can
be
quite
a
creditable
grumbler
on
fridays
well
just
as
you
like
you
going
to
the
party
i
suppose
have
changed
your
mind
by
any
chance
and
determined
to
spend
the
evening
hectoring
me
if
you
are
going
you
better
go
i
sit
up
for
you
and
keep
some
cocoa
claire
rose
with
a
smile
i
appreciate
the
inference
starved
and
disillusioned
i
am
to
creep
home
and
weep
on
your
bosom
well
we
see
for
the
present
i
tell
you
all
about
it
when
i
get
back
a
minute
whistling
at
the
front
door
produced
a
taxi
in
which
claire
seated
herself
and
was
whirled
westward
through
brightly
lighted
streets
in
the
less
fashionable
neighbourhoods
the
usual
saturday
crowd
thronged
round
the
shops
and
booths
making
their
purchases
at
an
hour
when
perishable
goods
could
be
obtained
at
bargain
prices
claire
and
cecil
had
themselves
made
such
expeditions
before
now
coming
home
triumphant
with
some
savoury
morsel
for
supper
and
with
quite
a
lavish
supply
of
flowers
to
deck
the
little
room
at
the
time
the
expeditions
had
been
pleasant
enough
and
there
had
seemed
nothing
in
the
least
in
taking
advantage
of
the
opportunity
but
the
girl
in
the
cloudy
cloak
looked
through
the
windows
of
her
chariot
with
an
ineffable
condescension
and
found
it
difficult
to
believe
that
she
herself
had
ever
made
one
of
so
insignificant
a
throng
how
i
do
love
luxury
it
the
breath
of
my
nostrils
she
said
to
herself
with
a
little
sigh
of
content
as
she
straightened
herself
in
her
seat
and
smiled
back
at
her
own
reflection
in
the
strip
of
mirror
opposite
her
hair
had
gone
just
right
what
a
comfort
that
was
sometimes
it
took
a
stupid
turn
and
could
not
be
induced
to
obey
she
opened
the
cloak
at
the
top
and
peeped
at
the
dainty
whiteness
within
with
the
daring
thoroughly
french
touch
of
vivid
emerald
green
which
gave
a
to
the
whole
yes
it
was
quite
as
pretty
as
she
had
believed
every
whit
as
becoming
i
do
look
a
bit
like
a
mistress
smiled
claire
and
snoodled
back
again
against
the
cushions
with
a
deep
breath
of
content
she
was
not
in
the
least
shy
many
a
girl
about
to
make
her
into
a
strange
house
would
have
been
suffering
qualms
of
misgiving
by
this
time
but
claire
had
spent
her
life
more
or
less
in
public
and
was
accustomed
to
meet
strangers
as
a
matter
of
course
so
there
was
no
dread
to
take
the
edge
off
her
enjoyment
even
when
the
taxi
slowed
down
to
take
its
place
in
the
stream
of
vehicles
which
were
drawn
up
before
mrs
willoughby
house
she
knew
only
a
heightened
enjoyment
in
the
realisation
that
it
was
not
a
party
at
all
but
a
real
big
fashionable
at
home
the
usual
crowd
of
onlookers
stood
on
either
side
of
the
door
and
as
claire
descended
from
the
taxi
the
sight
of
her
golden
slippers
and
floating
clouds
of
gauze
evoked
a
gratifying
murmur
of
admiration
she
passed
on
with
her
head
in
the
air
looking
neither
to
right
nor
left
but
close
against
the
rails
stood
a
couple
of
working
girls
whose
wistful
eyes
drew
her
own
as
with
a
magnet
in
their
expression
was
a
whole
world
of
awe
of
admiration
they
looked
at
her
as
at
a
denizen
of
another
sphere
hardly
presuming
even
to
be
envious
so
infinitely
was
she
removed
from
their
life
as
claire
met
their
eyes
an
impulse
seized
her
to
stop
and
tell
them
that
she
was
just
a
working
girl
like
themselves
but
convention
being
too
strong
to
allow
of
such
familiarities
she
smiled
instead
with
such
a
frank
and
friendly
acknowledgment
of
their
admiration
as
brought
a
flash
of
pleasure
to
their
faces
she
a
real
laidy
she
is
said
gladys
to
maud
and
maud
sniffed
in
assent
and
answered
strongly
you
bet
your
life
the
inside
of
the
house
seemed
out
of
all
proportion
with
the
outside
appearance
this
is
a
special
peculiarity
of
the
west
end
which
has
puzzled
many
a
visitor
besides
claire
gifford
what
the
magic
which
transforms
narrow
slips
of
buildings
into
spacious
halls
and
imposing
flights
of
stairways
viewed
from
the
street
the
town
houses
of
personages
seem
quite
inadequate
for
their
purpose
viewed
from
within
they
are
all
that
is
stately
and
appropriate
those
of
us
who
live
in
less
favoured
neighbourhoods
would
fain
solve
the
riddle
mrs
willoughby
stood
at
the
top
of
her
own
staircase
shaking
hands
with
the
stream
of
ascending
guests
and
motioning
them
forward
to
the
suite
of
entertaining
rooms
from
which
came
a
steady
murmur
of
voices
she
was
a
stout
woman
with
a
vast
expanse
of
white
shoulders
which
seemed
to
join
right
on
to
her
head
without
any
preliminary
in
the
shape
of
a
neck
her
hair
was
dark
and
a
plain
face
was
lightened
by
a
pair
of
exceedingly
pleasant
exceedingly
alert
brown
eyes
as
soon
as
she
met
those
eyes
claire
felt
assured
that
the
kindness
of
which
she
had
heard
was
a
real
thing
and
that
this
woman
could
be
counted
upon
as
a
friend
there
was
it
is
true
a
slight
vagueness
in
the
manner
in
which
she
made
her
greeting
but
a
murmur
of
mrs
fanshawe
instantly
revived
recollections
of
course
of
course
she
cried
heartily
so
glad
you
could
come
my
dear
i
must
see
you
later
on
reginald
she
beckoned
to
a
lad
in
an
eton
suit
i
want
you
to
take
charge
of
miss
gifford
take
her
to
have
some
coffee
and
introduce
her
to
some
one
nice
a
nod
and
a
smile
and
mrs
willoughby
had
turned
back
to
welcome
the
next
guest
in
order
while
the
eton
boy
offered
his
arm
with
the
air
of
a
prince
of
the
blood
and
led
the
way
to
a
refreshment
buffet
around
which
the
guests
were
swarming
with
an
eagerness
astonishing
to
behold
when
one
realised
how
lately
they
must
have
risen
from
the
claire
found
her
young
cavalier
very
efficient
in
his
attentions
he
settled
her
in
a
comfortable
corner
brought
her
a
cup
of
coffee
heaped
with
foaming
cream
and
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
it
was
going
to
be
a
beastly
crush
claire
wondered
if
it
would
be
tactful
to
inquire
how
he
happened
to
be
at
home
in
the
middle
of
a
term
but
while
she
hesitated
he
supplied
the
information
himself
i
home
on
leave
appendicitis
left
the
nursing
home
three
weeks
ago
been
at
the
sea
and
came
back
yesterday
in
time
for
this
show
getting
a
bit
tired
of
slacking
you
must
be
dear
me
i
sorry
too
bad
to
begin
so
soon
murmured
claire
pitifully
but
master
reginald
disdained
sympathy
oh
i
dunno
he
said
calmly
it
quite
the
correct
thing
do
you
know
everybody
doing
it
just
as
well
to
get
it
through
it
might
he
opened
his
pale
eyes
with
a
startled
look
it
might
have
come
on
in
the
hols
pretty
fool
i
should
have
looked
if
i
been
done
out
of
winter
sports
there
that
way
of
looking
at
it
claire
said
demurely
for
a
moment
she
debated
whether
she
should
break
the
fact
that
she
herself
was
a
but
decided
that
it
would
be
wiser
to
refrain
since
the
boy
would
certainly
feel
more
at
ease
with
her
in
her
private
capacity
so
for
the
next
they
sat
happily
together
in
their
corner
while
the
boy
discoursed
on
the
subjects
nearest
his
heart
and
the
girl
deftly
switched
him
back
to
the
subjects
more
congenial
yes
i
love
cricket
at
least
i
sure
i
should
do
if
i
understood
it
better
tell
me
who
is
the
big
old
lady
with
the
eyeglass
and
the
diamond
tiara
could
tell
you
to
save
my
life
rather
an
is
she
towers
over
the
men
i
say
you
ought
to
go
to
lord
will
you
turn
up
at
lord
next
year
to
see
our
match
we
might
meet
somewhere
and
give
you
tea
harrow
wo
have
a
chance
we
got
a
bowler
who
can
he
really
how
nice
oh
that
a
man
with
the
long
hair
i
sure
he
is
something
or
does
something
different
from
other
people
is
he
a
musician
do
you
think
do
you
ever
have
music
on
these
evenings
rather
sometimes
the
mater
hires
a
big
swell
sometimes
she
lets
loose
the
amateurs
she
knows
lots
of
amateurs
people
who
are
trying
to
be
and
want
the
chance
to
show
off
the
mater
encourages
them
great
mistake
if
you
ask
me
but
you
need
listen
if
you
do
want
she
has
one
of
these
crushes
once
a
month
beastly
dull
i
call
them
ca
think
why
the
people
come
but
she
gives
them
a
rattling
good
feed
supper
comes
on
at
twelve
in
the
downstairs
but
claire
was
not
interested
in
supper
all
her
attention
was
taken
up
in
watching
the
stream
of
people
passing
by
and
for
a
time
the
youth
of
her
companion
had
seemed
an
advantage
since
it
made
it
easy
to
indulge
her
curiosity
concerning
her
by
a
succession
of
questions
which
might
have
been
boring
to
an
adult
as
time
passed
on
however
and
she
became
conscious
that
more
than
one
pair
of
masculine
eyes
turned
in
her
direction
she
wished
frankly
master
reginald
would
remember
his
mother
instructions
and
proceed
without
further
delay
to
introduce
her
to
someone
nice
to
return
home
and
confess
to
cecil
that
she
had
spent
the
evening
in
company
with
a
schoolboy
would
be
almost
as
humiliating
as
sitting
alone
in
a
corner
it
was
at
this
point
that
claire
became
aware
of
the
presence
of
a
very
small
very
wizened
old
woman
sitting
alone
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
her
mittened
hands
clawing
each
other
restlessly
in
her
lap
her
sunken
eyes
glancing
to
right
and
left
with
a
glance
distinctly
hostile
the
passing
of
guests
frequently
hid
her
from
view
but
when
a
gap
came
again
there
she
sat
still
alone
still
twisting
her
mittened
hands
still
coldly
staring
around
claire
thought
she
looked
a
very
disagreeable
old
lady
but
she
was
sorry
for
her
all
the
same
horrid
to
be
old
and
cross
and
to
be
alone
in
a
crowd
she
put
yet
another
question
to
the
boy
by
her
side
that
said
master
willoughby
seriously
is
jane
aunt
jane
is
the
skeleton
in
our
cupboard
the
mater
says
so
and
she
ought
to
know
every
time
the
mater
has
a
show
the
moment
the
door
is
opened
in
comes
jane
and
sits
it
out
until
every
one
has
gone
if
any
one
dares
speak
to
her
she
snaps
his
head
off
and
if
they
let
her
alone
she
furious
and
gives
it
to
the
mater
after
gone
most
of
the
crowd
know
her
by
now
and
pretend
they
do
see
and
she
gets
waxier
and
waxier
would
you
like
to
be
introduced
yes
please
said
claire
unexpectedly
she
was
tired
of
sitting
in
one
corner
and
wanted
to
move
her
position
but
she
was
also
quite
genuinely
anxious
to
try
her
hand
at
cheering
poor
cross
jane
the
old
lady
in
the
villa
beau
sejour
had
made
a
point
of
petting
and
flattering
the
pretty
english
girl
and
claire
was
complacently
assured
that
this
old
lady
would
follow
their
example
but
she
was
mistaken
aunt
jane
miss
gifford
asks
to
be
introduced
to
you
miss
gifford
lady
jane
willoughby
reginald
beat
a
hurried
retreat
and
claire
seated
herself
at
the
end
of
the
sofa
and
smilingly
awaited
her
companion
lead
it
did
not
come
after
one
automatic
nod
of
the
head
lady
jane
resumed
her
former
position
taking
no
more
notice
of
the
than
if
she
had
remained
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
claire
felt
her
cheeks
begin
to
burn
her
complacence
had
suffered
a
shock
but
pride
came
to
her
rescue
and
she
made
a
determined
effort
at
conversation
that
nice
boy
has
been
telling
me
that
he
has
had
appendicitis
lady
jane
favoured
her
with
a
frosty
glance
yes
he
has
perhaps
you
will
excuse
me
from
talking
about
it
i
object
to
the
discussion
of
diseases
at
social
gatherings
claire
cheeks
grew
hotter
still
a
quick
retort
came
to
her
lips
i
was
going
to
discuss
it
i
only
mentioned
it
for
for
something
to
say
i
could
think
how
else
to
begin
the
droop
of
lady
jane
eyelids
inferred
that
it
was
really
quite
superfluous
to
begin
at
all
claire
waited
a
whole
two
minutes
by
the
clock
and
then
made
another
effort
i
hear
we
are
to
have
some
music
later
on
sorry
to
hear
it
said
jane
really
i
was
so
glad
are
you
fond
of
music
then
i
am
very
fond
of
music
said
aunt
jane
and
there
was
a
world
of
insinuation
in
her
voice
without
a
definite
word
being
spoken
the
hearer
was
informed
that
good
music
real
music
music
worthy
the
name
was
a
thing
that
no
sane
person
would
expect
to
hear
at
mrs
willoughby
at
homes
she
was
really
the
most
terrifying
and
disconcerting
of
old
ladies
and
claire
heartily
repented
the
impulse
which
had
brought
her
to
her
side
a
pretty
thing
it
would
be
if
she
were
left
alone
on
this
sofa
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
but
fortune
was
kind
and
from
across
the
room
came
a
good
angel
who
was
so
exactly
a
reproduction
of
mrs
willoughby
herself
minus
half
her
age
that
it
must
obviously
be
her
daughter
janet
willoughby
was
not
a
pretty
girl
but
she
looked
gay
and
bright
and
beaming
with
good
humour
and
at
this
moment
with
a
spice
of
mischief
into
the
bargain
the
manner
in
which
she
held
out
her
hand
to
claire
was
as
friendly
as
though
the
two
girls
had
been
friends
for
years
miss
gifford
i
was
sure
it
must
be
you
mother
told
me
to
look
for
you
aunt
jane
will
you
excuse
my
running
away
with
miss
gifford
several
people
are
asking
to
be
introduced
will
you
come
with
me
miss
gifford
i
want
to
take
you
into
the
music
room
claire
rose
with
a
very
leap
of
eagerness
and
as
soon
as
they
had
gained
a
safe
distance
miss
willoughby
turned
to
her
with
twinkling
eyes
i
am
afraid
you
were
having
a
bad
time
i
caught
sight
of
you
across
the
room
and
was
so
sorry
who
took
you
over
there
was
it
that
naughty
reginald
he
did
but
i
asked
him
i
thought
she
looked
lonely
i
thought
perhaps
she
would
be
pleased
janet
willoughby
smile
showed
a
quick
approval
that
was
kind
thanks
for
the
good
intention
but
i
ca
let
you
be
victimised
any
more
i
want
to
talk
to
you
myself
and
men
have
been
asking
for
introductions
to
the
girl
with
the
green
sash
you
know
mrs
fanshawe
do
you
is
she
charming
she
and
i
are
the
greatest
of
chums
i
always
say
she
has
never
succeeded
in
growing
older
than
seventeen
she
is
so
delightfully
irresponsible
and
impulsive
she
wrote
mother
a
charming
letter
about
you
it
made
us
quite
anxious
to
meet
you
but
you
know
what
town
life
is
a
continual
rush
everything
gets
put
off
it
was
awfully
good
of
you
to
ask
me
at
all
and
very
kind
of
mrs
fanshawe
to
write
i
only
know
her
in
the
most
casual
way
we
crossed
over
from
antwerp
together
and
her
maid
was
ill
and
i
was
able
to
be
of
some
use
and
when
she
heard
that
i
was
coming
to
work
in
london
and
that
i
knew
nobody
here
she
jane
willoughby
stared
in
frank
amazement
do
you
really
mean
that
that
was
all
you
met
her
only
that
one
time
you
know
nothing
of
her
home
or
her
people
only
that
time
i
hope
i
hope
you
do
think
claire
suffered
an
anxious
moment
before
she
realised
that
for
some
unexplained
reason
miss
willoughby
was
more
pleased
than
annoyed
by
the
intelligence
an
air
of
something
extraordinarily
like
relief
passed
over
her
features
she
laughed
gaily
and
said
i
do
think
anything
at
all
except
that
it
is
delightfully
like
mrs
fanshawe
she
wrote
as
if
she
had
known
you
for
ages
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
probably
know
you
quite
well
she
is
so
extraordinarily
quick
and
clever
that
she
crowds
as
much
life
into
an
hour
as
an
ordinary
person
does
into
a
week
she
told
us
that
you
had
chosen
to
come
to
london
to
work
rather
than
go
to
india
and
have
a
good
time
how
plucky
of
you
and
you
teach
at
one
of
the
big
high
schools
you
do
look
in
the
least
like
a
ah
i
off
duty
you
should
see
me
in
the
morning
in
my
working
clothes
you
should
see
me
at
night
correcting
exercises
on
the
in
a
parlour
and
cooking
sausages
in
a
for
our
evening
meal
i
with
the
english
mistress
and
do
most
of
our
cooking
myself
as
the
landlady
tastes
and
ours
do
agree
i
getting
to
be
quite
an
expert
at
manufacturing
sixpenny
dainties
janet
willoughby
breathed
a
deep
sigh
the
diamond
star
on
her
neck
sent
out
vivid
gleams
of
light
what
fun
she
sighed
enviously
what
fun
and
as
she
spoke
there
flashed
suddenly
before
the
eyes
of
her
listener
a
picture
of
the
english
mistress
lying
on
the
green
plush
sofa
her
shabby
slippers
showing
beneath
the
hem
of
her
shabby
skirt
spending
the
holiday
saturday
evening
at
home
because
she
had
no
invitations
to
go
out
and
no
money
to
spare
for
an
entertainment
oh
i
envy
you
sighed
janet
deeply
it
one
of
my
greatest
ambitions
to
share
rooms
with
a
nice
girl
and
live
the
simple
life
and
be
free
to
do
whatever
one
liked
mother
loves
independence
in
other
girls
but
her
principles
do
extend
to
me
she
says
an
only
daughter
place
is
at
home
but
you
are
an
only
daughter
too
i
am
but
other
circumstances
were
different
it
was
a
case
of
being
dependent
on
a
stepfather
or
of
working
for
myself
so
i
chose
to
work
and
and
i
sure
you
never
regret
it
claire
extended
her
hands
in
the
expressive
french
shrug
ah
but
i
do
horribly
at
times
even
now
after
three
months
work
i
have
a
conviction
that
i
shall
regret
it
more
and
more
as
time
goes
on
but
if
i
had
to
decide
again
i
do
just
the
same
it
a
question
of
principle
versus
so
many
things
laziness
and
and
wanting
to
have
a
good
time
and
the
habits
of
a
lifetime
and
irritation
with
stupid
girls
who
wo
work
janet
willoughby
gave
a
soft
murmur
of
understanding
yes
of
course
stupid
of
me
to
say
that
of
course
you
must
get
tired
when
you
never
taught
before
does
it
bore
you
very
much
teaching
oh
no
as
a
rule
i
love
it
and
take
a
pride
in
inventing
new
ways
to
help
the
girls
it
the
all
work
and
no
play
that
gets
on
one
nerves
and
the
feeling
of
being
cut
off
from
the
world
by
an
impassable
barrier
of
something
that
really
does
exist
people
have
a
prejudice
against
they
think
they
are
dull
and
proper
and
pedantic
if
they
want
to
be
complimentary
they
say
do
look
like
a
you
did
yourself
not
two
minutes
ago
but
really
and
truly
they
are
just
natural
everyday
girls
wanting
to
have
a
good
time
in
their
leisure
hours
like
other
girls
you
ca
think
how
happy
i
was
to
come
here
and
have
the
chance
of
putting
on
pretty
things
again
janet
willoughby
put
her
hand
on
claire
arm
and
piloted
her
deftly
through
the
crowd
now
she
said
firmly
you
just
stay
here
and
i
bring
up
all
the
nicest
men
in
the
room
and
introduce
them
in
turns
you
have
a
good
time
and
you
are
wearing
the
very
prettiest
things
in
the
room
if
it
any
comfort
to
you
to
hear
it
we
wo
talk
about
school
any
more
is
for
fun
the
next
hour
passed
on
flying
feet
while
claire
sat
the
queen
of
a
little
court
and
janet
willoughby
flitted
to
and
fro
bringing
up
fresh
arrivals
to
be
introduced
and
drafting
off
the
last
batch
to
other
parts
of
the
crowded
rooms
all
the
men
were
agreeable
and
amusing
and
showed
a
flattering
appreciation
of
their
position
claire
felt
no
more
interest
in
one
than
in
another
but
she
liked
them
all
and
felt
a
distinct
pleasure
in
talking
to
men
again
after
the
existence
of
the
last
months
she
was
pleased
to
welcome
a
smiled
unconcerned
at
a
farewell
from
time
to
time
the
buzz
of
voices
was
temporarily
broken
by
the
crash
of
the
piano
but
always
before
the
end
of
each
performance
it
rose
again
and
steadily
swelled
in
volume
in
truth
the
excellence
of
the
performance
was
no
great
inducement
to
listen
and
mrs
forehead
showed
a
pucker
of
anxiety
she
drifted
across
to
corner
and
spoke
a
few
kindly
words
of
welcome
which
ended
in
a
half
apology
i
am
sorry
the
music
is
so
poor
it
varies
so
much
on
different
nights
sometimes
we
have
quite
a
number
of
good
singers
but
there
are
none
i
am
afraid
so
much
piano
grows
a
little
boring
she
looked
in
the
girl
face
with
a
quick
inquiry
do
sing
the
word
seemed
final
yet
there
was
an
unmistakable
hesitation
in
claire
voice
mrs
willoughby
glance
sharpened
but
you
do
something
play
recite
what
is
it
my
dear
i
should
be
so
grateful
i
whistle
confessed
claire
with
a
blush
and
a
little
babble
of
delight
greeted
the
words
every
one
who
heard
hailed
the
chance
of
a
variety
in
the
monotonous
programme
mrs
willoughby
beamed
with
all
the
relief
of
a
hostess
unexpectedly
relieved
of
anxiety
delightful
charming
my
dear
it
will
be
such
a
help
you
would
like
an
accompaniment
i
introduce
you
to
mr
helder
he
can
play
anything
you
like
will
you
come
now
i
am
sure
every
one
will
be
charmed
there
was
no
time
for
a
second
thought
the
next
moment
the
mr
helder
was
bowing
over
claire
hand
and
professing
his
delight
the
little
group
in
the
corner
were
pressing
forward
to
obtain
a
point
of
vantage
and
throughout
the
company
in
general
was
passing
a
wordless
hum
of
excitement
mr
helder
was
seating
himself
at
the
piano
a
girl
in
a
white
dress
had
ascended
the
impromptu
platform
and
now
stood
by
his
side
a
pretty
girl
a
very
pretty
girl
a
girl
who
acknowledged
the
scattered
applause
with
a
smile
which
showed
two
dimples
on
one
cheek
a
girl
who
looked
neither
shy
nor
conceited
but
simply
as
if
she
were
enjoying
herself
very
much
and
expected
everybody
to
do
the
same
she
was
going
to
sing
it
would
be
a
relief
to
listen
to
singing
after
the
continued
performances
upon
the
piano
they
hoped
sincerely
that
she
could
sing
well
why
did
the
accompaniment
begin
then
suddenly
a
hand
gave
a
signal
mr
helder
hands
descended
on
the
keys
and
at
the
same
instant
from
between
lips
there
flowed
a
stream
of
high
notes
repeating
the
air
with
a
fluency
and
ease
she
had
chosen
the
ballad
cherry
ripe
the
quaint
turns
and
trills
of
which
lent
themselves
peculiarly
well
to
this
method
of
interpretation
and
the
swing
and
gaiety
of
the
measure
carried
the
audience
by
storm
looking
down
from
her
platform
claire
could
see
the
indifferent
faces
suddenly
lighten
into
interest
into
smiles
into
positive
beams
of
approval
at
the
second
verse
heads
began
to
wag
unconsciously
to
their
owners
lips
began
to
purse
it
was
inspiring
to
watch
those
faces
to
know
that
it
was
she
herself
who
had
wrought
the
magic
change
those
moments
for
claire
were
pure
undiluted
joy
whistling
had
come
to
her
as
a
natural
gift
compensating
to
some
extent
for
the
lack
of
a
singing
voice
later
on
she
had
taken
lessons
and
practised
seriously
to
perfect
her
facility
at
school
in
paris
later
on
in
attending
social
gatherings
with
her
mother
she
had
had
abundant
opportunities
of
overcoming
the
initial
shyness
but
indeed
shyness
was
never
a
serious
trouble
with
claire
gifford
who
was
gifted
with
that
very
agreeable
combination
of
qualities
an
amiable
desire
to
please
other
people
and
a
comfortable
assurance
of
her
own
powers
at
the
end
of
the
third
verse
the
applause
burst
out
with
a
roar
bravos
sounded
from
every
side
and
encores
persisted
so
strenuously
that
claire
was
not
permitted
even
to
descend
from
her
platform
mrs
willoughby
rustled
forward
full
of
gratitude
and
thanks
mr
helder
rubbed
his
hands
and
beamingly
awaited
further
commands
what
would
cecil
have
to
say
to
a
success
like
this
claire
second
choice
was
one
of
mendelssohn
songs
without
words
a
quieter
measure
this
time
sweet
and
flowing
and
giving
opportunity
for
a
world
of
delicate
phrasing
it
was
one
of
the
pieces
which
she
had
practised
with
a
master
and
with
which
she
felt
most
completely
at
home
and
if
the
audience
found
it
agreeable
to
hear
they
also
to
judge
from
their
faces
found
it
equally
agreeable
to
watch
cheeks
were
flushed
to
a
soft
her
head
moved
to
and
fro
unconsciously
keeping
time
with
the
air
one
little
golden
shoe
softly
tapped
the
floor
her
unconsciousness
of
self
added
to
the
charm
of
the
performance
but
once
the
audience
noticed
with
sympathetic
amusement
her
composure
was
seriously
threatened
so
that
the
notes
quavered
ominously
and
the
twin
dimples
deepened
into
veritable
holes
claire
had
caught
sight
of
jane
standing
in
solitary
state
at
the
rear
of
the
throng
of
listeners
her
mittened
fingers
still
plucking
her
eyes
frosty
with
disapproval
after
that
claire
safeguarded
her
composure
by
looking
steadily
downward
at
the
points
of
her
shoes
until
the
end
of
the
song
approached
when
it
seemed
courteous
once
more
to
face
her
audience
she
raised
her
eyes
and
as
she
did
so
her
heart
leapt
within
her
with
a
startling
force
she
was
thankful
that
it
the
end
that
the
long
final
note
was
already
on
her
lips
for
there
standing
in
the
doorway
his
face
upraised
to
hers
stood
her
knight
of
the
railway
station
the
rescuer
of
the
lost
box
erskine
fanshawe
himself
chapter
nine
the
supper
claire
stepped
down
from
the
platform
to
be
surrounded
by
a
throng
of
guests
all
eager
to
express
their
admiration
of
her
interesting
performance
to
marvel
how
she
could
do
it
and
to
congratulate
her
upon
so
unusual
an
accomplishment
and
she
smiled
and
bowed
declared
that
it
was
quite
easy
and
perjured
herself
by
maintaining
that
anyone
could
do
as
well
acutely
conscious
all
the
time
that
captain
fanshawe
was
drawing
nearer
with
determined
steps
edging
his
way
towards
the
front
of
the
crowd
the
next
moment
her
hand
was
in
his
and
he
was
greeting
her
with
the
assurance
of
a
lifelong
friend
good
evening
miss
gifford
had
we
better
make
straight
for
supper
now
i
am
sure
you
must
need
it
it
was
practically
the
ordinary
invitation
there
was
nothing
to
find
fault
with
in
the
words
themselves
yet
the
impression
of
a
previous
arrangement
was
obviously
left
with
the
hearers
who
fell
back
giving
way
as
to
a
superior
right
as
for
claire
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
extended
arm
with
all
the
good
will
in
the
world
and
made
a
triumphant
passage
through
the
crowd
which
smiled
upon
her
as
though
agreeing
that
it
was
now
her
turn
to
be
amused
this
table
i
think
captain
fanshawe
said
leading
the
way
to
the
furthest
corner
of
the
and
claire
found
herself
sipping
a
hot
cup
of
soup
and
realising
that
the
world
was
an
agreeable
place
and
that
it
was
folly
ever
to
allow
oneself
to
be
downhearted
since
such
delightful
surprises
awaited
round
corners
ready
to
transform
the
grey
into
gold
captain
fanshawe
looked
exactly
as
memory
had
pictured
him
plain
of
feature
distinguished
in
bearing
grave
yet
with
that
lurking
light
in
his
eyes
which
showed
that
humour
lay
beneath
claire
smiled
at
him
across
the
table
and
asked
an
obvious
question
rather
a
different
from
our
last
did
you
know
me
at
once
i
did
he
said
and
added
deliberately
just
as
you
knew
me
oh
well
claire
tried
to
look
unconcerned
men
are
always
pretty
much
the
same
evening
dress
does
not
make
the
same
difference
to
them
she
knew
a
momentary
fear
lest
he
should
believe
she
was
fishing
for
a
compliment
and
give
the
ordinary
banal
reply
but
he
looked
at
her
with
a
grave
scrutiny
and
asked
quietly
was
that
one
of
the
frocks
which
went
astray
yes
all
of
it
it
was
even
divided
in
half
it
was
a
good
thing
the
box
turned
up
he
said
and
there
after
all
was
the
compliment
but
so
delicately
inferred
that
the
most
fastidious
taste
could
not
object
with
the
finishing
of
the
soup
came
the
first
reference
to
work
for
the
captain
casual
do
you
care
for
anything
solid
or
would
you
prefer
a
sweet
evoked
a
stare
of
dismay
oh
cried
claire
deeply
i
want
to
go
straight
through
i
been
living
on
mutton
and
cabbage
for
over
two
months
and
cooking
suppers
on
a
i
looked
forward
to
supper
as
part
of
the
treat
the
plain
face
lightened
into
a
delightful
smile
that
all
right
he
cried
now
we
know
where
we
are
i
had
much
dinner
myself
so
i
quite
game
let
us
study
the
book
of
the
words
a
lay
on
the
table
a
square
white
card
emblazoned
with
many
golden
words
captain
fanshawe
drew
his
chair
nearer
and
ran
his
finger
down
the
list
while
claire
bent
forward
to
signify
a
yea
or
nay
every
delicacy
in
season
and
out
of
season
seemed
to
find
its
place
on
that
list
which
certainly
justified
master
reginald
eulogy
of
his
mother
good
feeds
claire
found
it
quite
a
serious
matter
to
decide
between
so
many
good
things
and
even
with
various
curtailments
made
rather
out
of
pride
than
inclination
the
meal
threatened
to
last
some
considerable
time
well
there
was
obvious
satisfaction
in
the
manner
in
which
captain
fanshawe
delivered
his
orders
and
for
herself
she
had
been
dignified
and
she
had
resolutely
shut
the
door
between
this
man
and
herself
and
devoted
herself
to
work
and
now
since
fate
had
thrown
him
in
her
way
for
a
chance
hour
she
could
enjoy
herself
with
a
light
mind
it
was
good
to
talk
to
a
man
again
to
hear
a
deep
masculine
voice
to
look
at
a
broad
strong
frame
putting
aside
all
question
of
love
and
marriage
the
convent
life
is
no
more
satisfying
than
the
monastic
each
sex
was
designed
by
god
to
be
the
complement
of
the
other
each
must
suffer
from
lack
of
the
other
companionship
i
arrived
just
as
you
began
your
performance
captain
fanshawe
informed
her
it
was
a
great
everybody
had
crowded
forward
to
listen
it
was
only
towards
the
end
of
your
second
er
how
exactly
should
one
express
it
that
i
managed
to
get
into
seeing
line
it
was
a
surprise
have
you
known
the
willoughbys
long
claire
looked
at
him
blankly
i
never
saw
them
before
your
mother
wrote
to
ask
them
if
they
would
send
me
a
card
oh
captain
fanshawe
was
certainly
surprised
and
claire
mentally
snubbed
herself
because
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
there
had
lain
a
suspicion
that
perhaps
just
perhaps
he
had
come
in
the
hope
of
meeting
his
acquaintance
of
the
railway
station
this
was
not
the
case
no
thought
of
her
had
been
in
his
mind
probably
until
the
moment
of
meeting
he
had
forgotten
her
existence
never
mind
they
met
and
he
was
agreeable
and
friendly
now
for
a
delightful
that
was
a
good
thought
of
the
you
will
like
them
they
are
delightful
people
just
the
people
you
ought
to
know
as
a
stranger
in
town
how
goes
the
school
teaching
by
the
way
as
well
as
you
expected
claire
deliberated
with
pursed
lips
no
i
expected
so
much
i
always
do
but
much
better
than
other
people
expected
for
me
theoretically
it
a
fine
life
there
are
times
when
it
seems
that
nothing
could
be
finer
but
but
what
i
do
think
it
quite
satisfying
as
a
life
does
anyone
suppose
it
is
they
try
to
they
have
to
for
most
teachers
there
is
so
little
else
the
waiter
handed
plates
of
lobster
mayonnaise
and
captain
fanshawe
said
quietly
tell
me
about
the
times
when
the
work
seems
fine
ah
many
times
it
depends
on
one
own
mood
and
health
because
of
course
the
circumstances
are
always
the
same
there
are
mornings
when
one
looks
round
a
big
and
sees
all
the
girls
faces
looking
upwards
and
it
gives
one
quite
a
thrilling
sense
of
power
and
opportunity
that
is
what
the
teacher
must
feel
every
is
the
fresh
virgin
soil
and
mine
is
the
joy
of
planting
the
right
seed
here
are
the
women
of
the
future
the
mothers
of
the
race
for
this
hour
they
are
mine
what
i
say
they
must
hear
they
will
listen
with
an
attention
which
even
their
parents
can
not
gain
the
words
which
i
speak
this
morning
may
bear
fruit
in
many
lives
the
ideal
attitude
but
the
ordinary
human
woman
has
other
mornings
when
all
she
feels
is
dear
me
six
hours
of
this
and
what
the
use
everything
i
batter
in
will
be
forgotten
by
the
ideal
anyway
in
teaching
french
verbs
i
want
to
go
to
bed
they
laughed
together
but
captain
fanshawe
sobered
quickly
and
his
brow
showed
furrows
of
distress
claire
looked
at
him
and
said
quickly
do
you
mind
if
we
do
talk
school
i
am
cinderella
wearing
fine
clothes
and
supping
in
state
i
so
much
rather
talk
cinderella
to
match
certainly
certainly
just
as
you
wish
lolling
back
in
his
chair
captain
fanshawe
adopted
an
air
of
indifference
and
drawled
slowly
quite
a
good
winter
is
it
lots
going
on
have
you
been
to
the
opera
lately
oh
dear
thought
claire
with
a
gush
how
refreshing
to
meet
a
up
man
who
can
pretend
like
a
child
she
simpered
and
replied
artificially
oh
yes
quite
often
the
dear
duchess
is
kind
her
box
is
open
to
me
whenever
i
choose
to
go
wonderful
scene
is
it
all
those
tiers
rising
one
above
another
do
you
ever
look
up
at
the
galleries
such
funny
people
sit
there
men
in
tweed
suits
girls
in
white
blouses
who
they
should
you
think
clerks
and
typists
and
and
people
of
that
persuasion
possibly
i
dare
say
one
never
knows
they
look
quite
respectable
and
quiet
do
you
know
the
twinkle
was
alight
in
captain
fanshawe
eyes
it
shone
more
brightly
still
as
he
added
everybody
turns
up
sooner
or
later
in
the
duchess
box
have
you
happened
to
meet
the
prince
for
a
moment
claire
groped
for
the
connection
then
dimpled
merrily
not
yet
no
but
i
am
hoping
the
waiter
approached
with
plates
of
chicken
in
aspic
and
more
rolls
of
crisp
browned
bread
claire
sent
a
thought
to
cecil
finishing
a
box
of
sardines
with
her
book
propped
up
against
the
cocoa
jug
the
cinderella
was
forgotten
while
her
eyes
roved
around
studying
the
silver
dishes
on
the
various
tables
when
you
were
a
small
boy
captain
fanshawe
did
you
go
out
to
parties
captain
fanshawe
knitted
his
brows
this
charming
girl
was
a
little
difficult
to
follow
conversationally
she
leapt
from
one
subject
to
another
with
disconcerting
agility
er
pardon
me
is
that
question
put
to
me
in
my
er
private
or
imaginary
capacity
private
of
course
but
naturally
you
did
did
you
have
pockets
to
the
best
of
my
remembrance
i
was
disguised
as
a
midshipmite
with
white
duck
trousers
of
a
prodigious
width
they
used
to
crackle
i
remember
there
was
room
for
a
dozen
pockets
claire
laid
her
arms
on
the
table
so
that
her
face
drew
nearer
his
own
her
voice
fell
to
a
stage
whisper
did
you
ever
take
something
home
the
captain
threw
back
his
head
with
a
peal
of
laughter
miss
gifford
what
a
question
i
was
an
ordinary
human
boy
i
did
and
sat
on
my
spoils
in
the
carriage
going
back
and
was
scolded
for
spoiling
my
clothes
i
had
a
small
brother
at
home
well
i
have
a
small
friend
she
has
letters
after
her
name
and
is
very
learned
and
clever
but
she
has
a
sweet
tooth
do
you
think
perhaps
in
this
bag
leave
it
to
me
he
said
firmly
and
when
the
waiter
next
appeared
he
received
an
order
to
bring
more
plenty
of
a
selection
of
all
the
small
dainties
in
silver
dishes
he
thinks
i
having
a
feast
claire
said
demurely
as
she
watched
the
progress
of
selection
then
she
met
erskine
fanshawe
eyes
and
nodded
in
response
to
an
unspoken
question
and
i
i
having
a
lovely
time
i
wish
it
were
possible
that
you
could
oftener
well
who
knows
a
week
ago
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
nothing
exciting
would
ever
happen
again
and
then
this
invitation
arrived
what
a
perfect
dear
miss
willoughby
seems
to
be
janet
she
he
said
warmly
she
is
a
girl
who
has
had
everything
the
world
can
give
her
and
yet
has
come
through
unspoiled
it
not
often
one
can
say
that
many
society
girls
are
selfish
and
vain
but
janet
never
seems
to
think
of
herself
you
find
her
an
ideal
friend
claire
brain
leapt
swiftly
to
several
conclusions
janet
willoughby
was
devoted
to
mrs
fanshawe
mrs
fanshawe
returned
her
devotion
janet
willoughby
was
rich
and
of
good
birth
mrs
fanshawe
had
mentally
adopted
her
as
a
given
the
of
a
rival
on
the
scene
her
desire
would
probably
be
fulfilled
since
such
sincere
liking
could
easily
ripen
into
love
just
for
a
moment
claire
felt
a
stab
of
that
lone
and
lorn
feeling
which
comes
to
solitary
females
at
the
realisation
of
another
happiness
then
she
rallied
herself
and
said
regretfully
i
afraid
i
sha
have
the
chance
our
lives
lie
too
far
apart
and
my
time
is
not
my
own
it
is
only
an
occasional
that
i
can
play
cinderella
what
do
you
do
on
sundays
go
to
church
in
the
morning
and
sleep
in
the
afternoon
sounds
elderly
does
it
but
i
do
enjoy
that
sleep
the
hour
after
lunch
is
the
most
trying
of
the
school
day
it
all
i
can
do
sometimes
to
smother
my
yawns
and
not
upset
the
whole
class
it
part
of
the
sunday
rest
to
be
able
to
let
go
lie
down
hugging
a
hot
bottle
and
sleep
steadily
till
it
time
for
tea
where
do
you
go
to
church
oh
claire
waved
an
airy
hand
it
depends
i
not
settled
down
i
am
still
trying
which
i
like
best
across
the
table
the
two
pairs
of
eyes
met
the
man
questioning
protesting
the
girl
steadily
defiant
why
wo
you
tell
me
came
the
unspoken
question
why
wo
you
give
me
a
chance
i
am
too
proud
came
the
unspoken
answer
your
mother
did
not
think
me
good
enough
i
will
accept
no
acquaintance
by
stealth
interruption
came
in
the
shape
of
the
waiter
bearing
a
tray
of
little
silver
dishes
filled
with
dainties
which
he
proceeded
to
arrange
in
rows
on
the
table
claire
relapsed
into
giggles
at
the
sight
and
captain
fanshawe
took
refuge
in
preternatural
solemnity
but
he
made
no
comment
and
the
moment
that
the
man
had
disappeared
both
heads
craned
eagerly
to
examine
the
spoils
chocolates
crystallised
peaches
french
plums
i
do
recognise
them
by
head
mark
these
are
too
sticky
these
look
uncommonly
good
the
big
fingers
hovered
over
each
dish
in
turn
lifting
sample
specimens
and
placing
them
on
claire
plate
whence
they
were
swiftly
conveyed
to
her
bag
not
a
single
sweetmeat
touched
her
own
lips
the
unconventionality
of
the
action
seemed
to
receive
some
justification
from
the
fact
that
she
was
confiscating
only
her
own
share
when
the
waiter
returned
with
ices
the
little
bag
bulged
suspiciously
and
the
silver
dishes
were
no
longer
required
the
waiter
was
ordered
to
carry
them
away
and
plainly
considered
that
some
people
did
not
know
what
they
wanted
the
only
thing
lacking
is
a
cracker
i
invariably
purloined
a
cracker
and
doubled
up
the
ends
i
suppose
we
are
hardly
near
enough
to
christmas
by
the
by
what
are
you
doing
for
christmas
you
will
have
holidays
of
course
captain
fanshawe
said
with
an
elaborate
unconsciousness
and
claire
kept
her
eyes
on
her
plate
i
may
go
to
belgium
i
have
decided
there
seem
to
be
a
good
many
things
you
can
not
decide
miss
gifford
you
have
forgotten
what
i
asked
you
what
did
you
ask
that
if
ever
i
could
help
if
you
ever
needed
help
i
shall
want
help
badly
during
the
next
few
weeks
when
the
examinations
come
on
and
i
have
all
the
papers
to
set
and
correct
captain
fanshawe
refused
to
smile
the
kind
of
help
that
a
man
can
give
yes
i
remember
you
were
very
kind
and
i
am
still
so
much
under
the
influence
of
the
old
life
that
i
do
feel
you
might
be
a
comfort
but
no
doubt
after
some
more
months
of
i
shall
resent
the
idea
that
a
man
could
do
any
more
than
i
could
myself
so
it
a
case
of
soon
or
never
you
will
hardly
be
cruel
enough
to
wish
to
hasten
my
extremity
i
not
so
sure
about
that
if
i
could
have
the
satisfaction
of
putting
things
to
rights
it
was
while
she
was
smiling
her
acknowledgment
of
this
pretty
speech
that
claire
became
conscious
of
janet
willoughby
eyes
bent
searchingly
upon
her
she
had
entered
the
room
on
the
arm
of
her
supper
partner
and
came
to
a
pause
not
a
yard
away
from
the
table
where
a
very
animated
apparently
very
intimate
conversation
was
taking
place
between
the
son
of
her
old
friend
and
the
girl
to
whom
she
had
believed
him
to
be
unknown
as
she
met
claire
glance
janet
smiled
automatically
but
the
friendliness
was
gone
from
her
glance
the
next
moment
captain
fanshawe
had
turned
seen
her
and
sprung
to
his
feet
janet
are
you
waiting
for
a
table
we
have
nearly
finished
you
sit
down
and
talk
to
miss
gifford
oh
please
do
hurry
we
find
another
place
you
have
met
before
then
i
did
know
i
saw
miss
gifford
when
she
was
befriending
my
mother
at
liverpool
street
station
and
recognised
her
upstairs
just
now
do
sit
down
janet
you
look
tired
janet
willoughby
took
the
offered
chair
and
exchanged
a
few
words
with
claire
as
she
gathered
together
her
possessions
but
the
subtle
change
persisted
claire
felt
vaguely
disturbed
but
the
next
passed
so
pleasantly
that
she
had
no
time
to
puzzle
over
the
explanation
captain
fanshawe
never
left
her
side
they
sat
together
on
the
same
sofa
which
jane
had
monopolised
for
the
earlier
part
of
the
evening
and
talked
of
many
things
and
discussed
many
problems
and
sometimes
agreed
and
oftener
disagreed
and
when
they
disagreed
most
widely
looked
into
each
other
eyes
and
smiled
as
who
should
say
what
do
words
matter
we
understand
at
one
claire
rose
to
depart
and
said
her
adieu
to
her
hostess
and
her
daughter
who
were
standing
side
by
side
my
dear
it
is
too
bad
i
have
had
time
with
you
and
i
am
so
grateful
for
the
charming
way
in
which
you
came
to
the
rescue
we
shall
hope
to
see
you
often
again
sha
we
janet
you
girls
must
arrange
a
day
which
suits
you
both
oh
yes
we
must
janet
said
as
she
shook
hands
but
she
made
no
attempt
to
make
the
arrangement
there
and
then
as
her
mother
obviously
expected
and
claire
realised
with
a
sinking
of
the
heart
that
a
promised
friendship
had
received
a
check
when
she
descended
to
the
hall
wrapped
in
her
filmy
cloak
it
was
to
find
captain
fanshawe
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
he
looked
worried
and
grave
and
the
front
door
was
reached
before
he
made
the
first
remark
then
lingering
tentatively
on
the
threshold
he
looked
down
at
her
with
a
searching
glance
is
er
is
your
address
still
the
grand
hotel
claire
face
set
into
firm
lines
still
the
grand
hotel
for
a
moment
he
looked
her
steadily
in
the
eyes
then
said
quietly
and
my
address
is
still
the
carlton
club
he
bowed
and
turned
into
the
house
the
footman
banged
the
door
of
the
taxi
and
stood
awaiting
instructions
laburnum
crescent
said
claire
weakly
halfway
through
the
words
a
sudden
obstacle
arose
in
her
throat
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
struggle
through
she
hoped
to
goodness
the
footman
did
not
notice
there
now
what
did
i
tell
you
you
look
fagged
to
death
and
as
cross
as
two
sticks
five
shillings
wasted
on
taxis
and
nothing
for
it
but
getting
thoroughly
upset
next
time
i
hope
you
will
take
my
advice
said
cecil
and
took
up
her
candle
to
grope
her
way
up
the
dark
stairway
to
bed
chapter
ten
nowhere
to
go
cecil
observance
of
her
day
of
licenced
grumbling
was
somewhat
obstructed
by
the
fact
that
for
several
weeks
after
mrs
willoughby
at
home
monday
mornings
found
her
in
a
condition
of
excitement
and
gaiety
it
was
a
restless
gaiety
which
seemed
to
spring
rather
from
the
head
than
the
heart
and
claire
looking
on
with
puzzled
eyes
had
an
instinct
that
her
companion
was
assiduously
whipping
up
her
own
spirits
playing
the
part
of
happiness
with
all
her
force
with
the
object
of
convincing
the
most
critical
of
all
audiences
her
own
heart
life
was
a
lonely
thing
to
claire
in
these
days
for
cecil
went
out
regularly
every
saturday
and
sunday
returning
so
late
that
the
two
girls
did
not
meet
from
lunch
one
day
until
breakfast
the
next
she
vouchsafed
no
explanation
of
her
sudden
plunge
into
society
neither
beforehand
when
she
sat
stitching
at
pathetic
little
pieces
of
finery
nor
afterwards
when
letting
herself
in
with
her
she
crept
slowly
to
bed
never
deigning
to
enter
claire
room
for
one
of
those
it
dear
to
a
girl
heart
it
was
the
sight
of
those
pathetic
little
pieces
of
finery
which
first
suggested
the
idea
of
a
man
to
claire
mind
however
dear
and
intimate
a
woman
friend
may
be
the
prospect
of
meeting
her
does
not
inspire
a
with
sufficient
energy
to
sit
up
until
after
midnight
to
cover
a
shabby
lace
blouse
with
ninon
or
to
put
a
new
silk
collar
and
cuffs
on
a
coat
it
is
only
the
prospect
of
meeting
the
eyes
of
some
male
creature
who
in
all
probability
will
remain
supremely
unconscious
of
the
result
which
stimulates
such
effort
and
claire
noting
cecil
restless
excitement
cast
anxious
thoughts
towards
the
particular
man
in
this
case
was
sophie
blake
correct
in
her
deduction
as
to
a
previous
unhappy
romance
claire
had
no
tangible
grounds
to
lead
her
to
a
conclusion
but
instinct
induced
her
to
agree
something
beyond
the
troubles
of
her
professional
life
had
gone
towards
warping
a
nature
that
was
naturally
generous
and
warm
in
imagination
claire
lived
over
the
pitiful
romance
poor
cecil
had
been
badly
treated
some
selfish
man
had
made
love
to
her
amusing
his
idle
hours
with
the
society
of
a
pretty
clever
woman
he
had
never
seriously
intended
marriage
but
cecil
had
believed
in
his
sincerity
had
given
him
her
whole
heart
had
dreamt
dreams
which
had
turned
the
grey
of
life
to
gold
and
then
had
come
the
end
how
had
the
end
come
some
day
when
they
were
walking
together
had
he
suddenly
announced
i
am
sailing
to
india
next
month
or
we
have
been
such
capital
friends
you
and
i
should
like
you
to
be
the
first
to
hear
my
news
i
am
engaged
to
be
married
to
the
dearest
girl
in
the
world
then
because
convention
decrees
that
when
her
heart
is
wounded
a
woman
may
make
no
moan
had
cecil
twisted
her
lips
into
a
smile
and
cried
i
am
so
glad
to
hear
it
i
hope
you
will
be
very
happy
while
the
solid
earth
rocked
around
her
at
such
thoughts
as
these
claire
flared
with
righteous
anger
if
that
should
ever
happen
to
me
i
would
pretend
i
would
spare
him
i
should
look
him
straight
in
the
face
and
say
all
this
time
you
have
been
pretending
to
love
i
thank
god
that
it
pretence
i
thank
god
that
he
has
preserved
me
from
being
the
wife
of
man
who
could
act
a
double
part
but
perhaps
there
had
been
no
real
ending
perhaps
the
man
had
simply
grown
tired
and
ceased
to
call
ceased
to
write
oh
surely
that
would
be
the
greatest
tragedy
of
all
claire
quick
brain
summoned
pictures
of
cecil
creeping
down
the
stairs
in
her
at
the
sound
of
the
postman
earliest
knock
and
creeping
back
with
no
letter
in
her
hand
of
cecil
entering
the
little
parlour
on
her
return
from
work
with
a
swift
hungry
look
at
the
table
on
which
the
letters
were
displayed
seeing
no
letter
lying
there
never
never
the
letter
for
which
she
watched
and
the
days
would
pass
and
the
weeks
and
the
months
and
the
old
routine
of
life
would
go
on
just
the
same
whatever
might
be
her
private
sufferings
the
english
mistress
must
be
at
her
post
each
morning
at
nine
she
must
wrestle
all
day
with
the
minds
of
dull
girls
listless
girls
clever
girls
girls
who
were
eager
to
learn
and
girls
whose
energies
seemed
condensed
in
the
effort
to
avoid
learning
at
all
however
sore
might
be
the
english
heart
it
was
her
duty
to
be
bright
and
alert
however
exhausted
her
own
stock
of
patience
she
must
still
be
a
female
job
in
her
treatment
of
her
many
pupils
a
must
banish
her
individuality
as
a
woman
on
the
threshold
of
the
while
on
duty
she
must
banish
every
outside
interest
from
her
mind
no
lying
in
bed
with
her
face
to
the
pillow
no
weeping
far
into
the
night
headache
and
swollen
eyelids
are
not
for
her
if
her
goes
wrong
she
must
lock
her
sorrow
in
her
own
heart
what
wonder
if
as
a
result
her
mind
grows
bitter
and
her
tongue
grows
sharp
that
a
lesson
for
me
i
must
never
never
allow
myself
to
fall
in
love
sighed
claire
to
herself
it
was
a
depressing
necessity
but
vaguely
she
allowed
herself
to
dream
of
a
distant
someday
when
the
ban
should
be
removed
something
might
happen
to
set
her
free
something
most
certainly
happen
optimistic
is
ready
enough
to
face
a
short
term
of
renunciation
but
it
resolutely
refuses
to
believe
in
its
continuance
a
shadow
fell
over
claire
happy
face
as
the
practical
application
of
this
resolve
came
into
her
mind
erskine
fanshawe
at
the
moment
he
was
the
one
masculine
figure
on
her
horizon
but
she
did
not
disguise
from
herself
that
of
all
the
men
she
had
met
he
attracted
her
the
most
what
a
mercy
that
she
had
had
the
resolution
to
put
a
stop
to
a
friendship
which
might
have
ended
in
unfitting
her
for
the
work
in
hand
it
had
been
hard
to
refuse
the
desired
information
but
the
fact
that
the
second
refusal
had
been
twice
as
hard
as
the
first
was
in
itself
a
proof
of
the
wisdom
of
her
decision
and
then
in
illogical
girlish
fashion
claire
fell
to
wondering
if
perchance
captain
fanshawe
would
discover
her
address
for
himself
it
would
be
the
easiest
of
tasks
since
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
put
the
question
to
mrs
willoughby
at
one
moment
claire
openly
hoped
that
he
would
at
the
next
she
recalled
the
expression
on
janet
willoughby
face
as
she
stood
staring
across
the
supper
room
and
then
she
was
not
so
sure
what
if
the
continuance
of
the
friendship
brought
trouble
on
janet
as
well
as
herself
laboriously
claire
thrust
the
thought
of
erskine
fanshawe
from
her
mind
but
just
because
inclination
would
have
led
her
to
so
blithely
meet
him
she
felt
a
keener
sympathy
with
her
companion
preparations
for
similar
meetings
the
time
of
examinations
had
come
and
night
after
night
the
table
of
the
little
parlour
was
littered
with
the
sheets
of
foolscap
which
were
to
test
the
progress
of
the
pupils
throughout
the
term
cecil
older
forms
had
been
studying
merchant
of
venice
richard
the
and
the
of
the
younger
forms
and
kingsley
she
had
set
the
questions
not
only
as
a
test
of
memory
but
with
a
view
of
drawing
out
original
thought
but
to
judge
from
her
groans
and
lamentations
the
result
was
poor
of
all
the
dull
stupid
unimaginative
not
an
original
idea
between
them
every
answer
exactly
like
the
last
a
of
my
own
remarks
in
class
if
there
a
creature
on
earth
i
despise
more
than
another
it
an
english
flapper
silly
vain
egotistical
then
the
french
mistress
would
scowl
across
the
table
and
say
now
you
put
me
out
i
was
just
counting
up
my
marks
oh
do
be
quiet
sorry
cecil
would
say
shortly
and
taking
up
her
pencil
slash
scathing
comments
at
the
side
of
the
foolscap
sheets
anon
she
would
smile
and
smile
again
and
forgetting
claire
request
would
interrupt
once
more
can
you
remember
the
name
of
florence
mason
if
i
strain
my
intellect
to
its
utmost
i
believe
i
can
well
remember
then
it
will
be
worth
while
she
do
something
that
girl
when
you
are
an
insignificant
old
woman
you
may
be
proud
to
boast
that
you
used
to
sit
at
the
very
table
on
which
her
first
english
essays
were
corrected
so
they
are
not
all
dull
stupid
unimaginative
the
exception
proves
the
rule
cried
cecil
and
swept
the
papers
together
with
a
sigh
of
relief
done
at
last
now
for
my
blouse
claire
cast
a
glance
at
the
clock
ten
and
you
are
so
tired
surely
you
wo
begin
to
sew
at
this
hour
i
must
i
want
it
for
saturday
i
tried
it
on
last
night
and
it
was
a
bit
nice
at
the
neck
i
got
to
alter
it
somehow
i
have
some
trimming
upstairs
just
be
quiet
for
five
minutes
while
i
finish
my
list
and
then
i
bring
down
my
and
we
see
what
we
can
find
that
was
in
constant
request
during
the
next
weeks
it
was
filled
with
the
dainty
oddments
which
a
woman
of
means
and
taste
collects
in
the
course
of
years
trimmings
and
laces
and
scraps
of
fine
brocades
belts
and
buckles
and
buttons
of
silver
and
paste
glittering
ends
of
tinsel
ends
of
silk
and
ribbons
that
were
really
too
pretty
to
throw
away
and
cunning
little
motifs
which
had
the
magic
quality
of
disguising
deficiencies
and
making
both
ends
meet
claire
gave
with
a
lavish
hand
and
cecil
gratitude
was
pathetic
in
its
intensity
more
and
more
as
the
weeks
passed
on
did
she
become
obsessed
with
the
craze
for
decking
herself
in
fine
garments
new
gloves
shoes
and
veils
were
purchased
to
supplement
the
garments
and
one
memorable
night
there
arrived
a
large
containing
an
evening
dress
and
cloak
i
have
been
out
so
little
these
last
years
i
have
no
clothes
to
wear
cecil
said
in
explanation
it
not
fair
to
er
people
when
they
take
you
about
to
look
as
if
you
had
come
out
of
the
ark
and
these
things
are
cheap
she
spoke
with
an
air
of
excusing
herself
and
with
a
flush
of
embarrassment
on
her
cheeks
and
claire
hastened
to
sympathise
and
agree
she
wondered
if
the
embarrassment
arose
from
the
fact
that
for
the
last
two
weeks
cecil
had
not
paid
her
share
of
the
joint
expenses
the
omission
had
happened
naturally
enough
for
on
each
occasion
when
the
landlady
appeared
with
the
bill
cecil
had
been
absent
on
one
of
her
now
frequent
excursions
when
it
had
seemed
the
simplest
thing
to
settle
in
full
and
await
repayment
next
day
repayment
however
had
not
come
half
a
dozen
times
over
cecil
had
exclaimed
oh
dear
there
that
money
i
remember
but
apparently
she
never
had
remembered
at
a
moment
when
her
purse
was
at
hand
claire
was
honestly
indifferent
the
hundred
pounds
which
she
had
deposited
in
a
bank
was
considerably
diminished
since
it
had
been
drawn
on
for
all
her
needs
but
the
term
salary
would
be
paid
in
a
short
time
and
the
thought
of
that
added
to
the
remainder
gave
her
a
pleasant
feeling
of
ease
it
was
only
when
for
the
third
saturday
cecil
hurried
off
with
an
air
of
fluster
and
embarrassment
that
an
unpleasant
suspicion
arose
the
weekly
bill
was
again
due
and
cecil
had
not
forgotten
she
was
only
elaborately
pretending
to
forget
claire
was
not
angry
she
was
perfectly
willing
to
play
the
part
of
banker
until
the
end
of
the
term
but
she
hated
the
thought
that
cecil
was
acting
a
part
and
deliberately
trying
to
deceive
what
if
she
had
been
extravagant
in
her
expenditure
on
clothes
and
had
run
herself
short
for
necessary
expenses
there
was
nothing
criminal
in
that
foolish
it
might
be
but
a
would
understand
that
after
being
staid
and
sensible
for
a
long
long
time
it
was
a
blessed
relief
to
the
feminine
mind
to
have
a
little
spell
of
recklessness
for
a
change
cecil
had
only
to
say
i
run
myself
horribly
short
can
you
pay
up
till
i
get
my
screw
and
the
whole
matter
would
have
been
settled
in
a
trice
but
to
pretend
to
forget
was
so
the
next
morning
after
breakfast
the
vexed
question
of
the
christmas
holidays
came
up
for
discussion
for
the
twentieth
time
cecil
had
previously
stated
that
she
always
spent
the
time
with
her
mother
but
it
now
appeared
that
to
a
certain
extent
she
had
changed
her
plans
i
shall
have
to
go
down
over
christmas
day
and
the
new
year
i
suppose
old
people
make
such
a
fuss
over
those
stupid
anniversaries
but
i
shall
come
up
again
on
the
second
i
prefer
to
be
in
town
we
have
to
pay
for
the
rooms
in
any
case
so
we
may
as
well
use
them
claire
face
lengthened
for
them
even
if
we
go
away
of
course
what
did
you
expect
the
landlady
is
let
off
her
own
rent
because
we
choose
to
take
a
holiday
there
no
saving
except
for
the
light
and
coal
by
the
way
i
owe
you
for
a
third
week
now
i
remember
have
you
decided
what
you
are
going
to
do
claire
shook
her
head
it
was
a
forlorn
feeling
that
christmas
was
coming
and
she
had
nowhere
to
go
until
now
she
had
gone
on
in
faith
feeling
sure
that
before
the
time
arrived
some
one
would
remember
her
loneliness
and
invite
her
if
only
for
the
day
itself
possibly
cecil
in
virtue
of
three
months
daily
companionship
would
ask
her
permission
to
invite
her
friend
if
only
for
a
couple
of
days
or
bright
friendly
sophie
blake
who
had
sympathised
with
her
loneliness
might
have
some
proposition
to
make
or
mrs
willoughby
who
was
so
interested
in
girls
who
were
working
for
themselves
or
miss
farnborough
who
knew
that
it
was
the
french
mistress
first
christmas
without
her
mother
but
no
such
suggestion
had
been
made
no
one
seemed
to
care
i
must
say
it
that
no
one
has
invited
you
said
cecil
sharply
i
do
think
much
of
your
grand
friends
if
they
ca
look
after
you
on
christmas
day
what
about
the
people
in
brussels
did
no
one
send
you
an
invitation
if
you
lived
there
for
three
years
surely
you
must
know
some
one
intimately
enough
to
offer
to
go
even
if
they
do
suggest
it
it
is
not
necessary
thank
you
said
claire
with
an
air
i
have
an
open
invitation
to
several
houses
but
i
am
saving
up
brussels
for
easter
when
the
weather
will
be
better
and
it
will
be
more
of
a
change
and
i
have
an
old
in
the
north
but
she
is
an
invalid
confined
to
her
room
i
should
be
an
extra
trouble
in
the
house
i
shall
manage
to
amuse
myself
somehow
it
will
be
an
opportunity
for
exploring
london
oh
well
cecil
said
vaguely
when
i
come
back
but
she
spoke
no
word
of
christmas
day
the
next
week
brought
the
various
festivities
with
which
saint
cuthbert
celebrated
the
end
of
the
christmas
term
there
was
a
school
dance
in
the
big
a
party
given
to
the
children
in
an
east
end
parish
and
last
and
most
important
of
all
the
ceremony
in
the
local
town
hall
when
an
old
girl
now
developed
into
a
celebrated
authoress
presented
the
prizes
and
gave
an
amusing
account
of
her
own
schooldays
which
evoked
storms
of
applause
from
the
audience
even
miss
farnborough
smiling
benignly
at
the
recital
of
misdoings
which
would
have
evoked
her
sternest
displeasure
on
the
part
of
pupils
then
the
girls
sang
a
short
cantata
and
the
eldest
girls
gave
a
scene
from
shakespeare
very
dull
and
exceedingly
correct
and
the
youngest
girls
acted
a
little
french
play
while
the
french
mistress
stood
in
the
wings
ready
to
prompt
her
face
very
hot
and
her
feet
very
cold
and
her
heart
beating
at
express
speed
this
moment
was
a
public
test
of
her
work
during
the
term
and
she
had
a
horror
that
the
children
would
forget
their
parts
and
disgrace
their
leader
as
well
as
themselves
she
need
not
have
feared
however
for
the
publicity
which
she
dreaded
was
just
the
stimulus
needed
to
spur
the
juvenile
actors
to
do
their
very
best
and
they
shrugged
they
gesticulated
they
rolled
their
r
they
reproduced
claire
own
little
mannerisms
with
an
which
brought
down
the
house
claire
lack
of
teaching
experience
might
make
her
less
sound
on
rules
and
routine
but
it
was
obvious
that
she
had
succeeded
in
one
important
point
she
had
lifted
french
from
the
level
of
a
task
and
converted
it
into
a
living
tongue
miss
farnborough
was
very
gracious
in
her
parting
words
to
her
new
mistress
i
have
not
come
to
my
present
position
without
learning
to
trust
my
perceptions
said
she
i
recognised
at
once
that
you
possessed
the
true
teaching
instinct
and
you
have
justified
my
choice
i
have
had
many
congratulations
on
your
pupils
performance
then
she
held
out
her
hand
with
a
charming
smile
i
hope
you
will
have
very
pleasant
holidays
she
made
no
inquiries
as
to
the
way
in
which
this
young
girl
was
to
spend
her
leisure
she
herself
was
with
the
strain
of
the
long
term
and
when
the
morrow
came
she
intended
to
pack
her
bag
and
start
off
for
a
sunny
swiss
height
where
for
the
next
few
weeks
it
would
be
her
chief
aim
to
forget
that
she
had
ever
seen
a
school
but
the
new
french
mistress
turned
away
with
a
heavy
heart
it
seemed
at
that
moment
as
if
nobody
cared
that
year
christmas
fell
on
a
monday
on
the
saturday
morning
cecil
packed
up
her
bag
and
departed
grumbling
for
her
week
at
home
before
she
left
claire
presented
her
with
a
christmas
gift
in
the
shape
of
a
charming
embroidered
scarf
and
cecil
kissed
her
and
flushed
and
looked
at
the
same
time
pleased
and
oppressed
and
hastily
pulling
out
her
purse
extracted
two
sovereigns
and
laid
them
down
on
the
table
i
keep
forgetting
that
money
three
weeks
was
it
there
two
pounds
let
me
know
the
rest
when
i
come
back
and
i
settle
up
christmas
is
an
awful
time
the
money
simply
melts
claire
had
an
uncomfortable
and
wholly
unreasonable
feeling
of
being
paid
for
her
present
as
she
put
the
two
sovereigns
in
her
purse
cecil
had
given
her
no
gift
and
the
lack
of
the
kindly
attention
increased
the
feeling
of
desolation
with
which
she
returned
to
her
empty
room
even
the
tiniest
offering
to
show
that
she
had
been
thought
of
would
have
been
a
comfort
the
landlady
came
into
the
room
to
remove
the
luncheon
tray
her
lips
pursed
into
an
expression
which
her
lodger
recognised
as
the
preliminary
to
a
bit
of
my
mind
when
the
outlying
cruets
and
dishes
had
been
crowded
together
in
a
perilous
pile
the
bit
of
her
mind
came
out
i
was
going
to
say
miss
that
of
course
you
will
arrange
to
dine
out
on
christmas
day
i
never
take
ladies
as
a
rule
but
miss
rhodes
she
said
being
teachers
you
would
be
away
all
holiday
time
i
never
had
a
lodger
before
who
stayed
in
the
house
over
christmas
and
of
course
you
must
understand
that
we
go
over
to
highgate
to
my
mother
for
the
day
and
the
girl
goes
out
and
i
could
possibly
think
of
cooking
do
be
afraid
mrs
mason
i
am
going
out
for
the
day
mrs
mason
lifted
the
tray
and
carried
it
out
of
the
room
shutting
the
door
behind
her
by
the
skilful
insertion
of
a
large
foot
encased
in
a
cashmere
boot
and
claire
stood
staring
at
her
wondering
if
it
were
really
her
own
voice
which
had
spoken
those
last
words
and
from
what
source
had
sprung
the
confidence
which
had
suddenly
flooded
her
heart
at
this
last
blow
of
all
when
even
the
little
parlour
closed
the
door
against
her
the
logical
course
would
have
been
to
collapse
into
utter
despair
instead
of
which
the
moment
had
brought
the
first
gleam
of
hope
now
said
the
voice
in
her
heart
everyone
has
failed
me
i
am
helpless
i
am
alone
this
is
god
moment
i
will
worry
no
more
but
leave
it
to
him
something
will
open
for
me
when
the
time
arrives
she
went
upstairs
put
on
her
hat
and
sallied
out
into
the
busy
streets
all
the
world
was
abroad
men
and
women
and
small
eager
children
all
bent
on
the
same
task
thronging
the
shops
to
the
doors
waiting
in
rows
for
the
favour
of
being
served
emerging
triumphant
with
arms
laden
with
spoils
on
every
side
fragments
of
the
same
conversation
floated
to
the
ears
what
can
i
get
for
kate
i
ca
think
what
in
the
world
to
buy
for
john
do
try
to
give
me
an
idea
what
rose
would
like
claire
mingled
with
the
throng
pushed
her
way
towards
the
crowded
counters
waited
a
preposterous
time
for
her
change
and
then
hurried
off
to
another
department
to
go
through
the
same
struggle
once
more
deliberately
she
threw
herself
into
the
christmas
feeling
turning
her
thoughts
from
herself
considering
only
how
she
could
add
to
the
general
happiness
she
bought
presents
for
everybody
for
the
cross
landlady
for
the
untidy
servant
girl
for
sophie
blake
and
flora
ross
for
the
maid
at
saint
cuthbert
who
waited
upon
the
with
a
selection
of
dainty
oddments
for
girl
friends
at
brussels
and
when
the
presents
themselves
had
been
secured
she
bought
prettily
tinted
paper
and
fancy
ribbons
and
decorated
name
cards
for
the
adornment
of
the
parcels
the
saffron
parlour
looked
quite
that
evening
and
claire
knew
a
happy
hour
as
she
made
up
her
gifts
in
their
dainty
wrappings
they
looked
so
gay
and
seasonable
that
she
decided
to
defer
putting
them
into
the
sober
outer
covering
of
brown
paper
as
long
as
possible
they
were
all
the
christmas
decoration
she
would
have
on
sunday
morning
the
feeling
of
loneliness
took
an
acute
turn
claire
longed
for
a
church
which
long
association
had
made
into
a
home
for
a
clergyman
who
was
also
a
friend
for
a
congregation
of
people
who
knew
her
and
cared
for
her
instead
of
the
long
rows
of
strange
faces
she
remembered
how
cecil
had
declared
that
in
london
a
girl
might
attend
the
same
church
for
years
on
end
and
never
hear
a
word
of
welcome
and
hope
died
low
in
her
breast
the
moment
of
exaltation
had
passed
and
she
told
herself
drearily
that
on
christmas
afternoon
she
must
take
a
book
and
sit
by
the
fire
in
the
of
some
great
station
dine
at
a
restaurant
and
perhaps
go
to
a
concert
at
night
for
weeks
past
claire
had
been
intending
to
go
to
a
west
end
church
to
hear
one
of
the
finest
of
modern
preachers
she
decided
to
go
this
morning
since
the
length
of
journey
now
seemed
rather
an
advantage
than
a
drawback
as
helping
to
fill
up
another
of
the
long
dragging
hours
she
dressed
herself
with
the
care
and
nicety
which
was
the
result
of
her
french
training
and
which
had
of
late
become
almost
a
religious
duty
for
the
study
of
the
fifteen
women
who
daily
assembled
round
the
table
in
the
was
as
a
danger
signal
to
warn
of
the
perils
ahead
with
the
one
exception
of
sophie
blake
not
one
of
the
number
seemed
to
make
any
effort
to
preserve
their
feminine
charm
they
dressed
their
hair
in
the
quickest
and
easiest
fashion
without
considering
the
question
of
appearance
they
wore
garments
with
collars
of
the
same
material
though
severely
neat
all
their
skirts
seemed
to
suffer
from
the
same
depressing
tendency
to
drop
at
the
back
their
bony
wrists
emerged
from
sleeves
the
point
of
view
adopted
was
that
appearance
did
not
matter
that
it
was
waste
of
time
to
consider
the
adornment
of
the
outer
woman
brain
was
the
factor
every
possible
moment
must
be
devoted
to
the
cultivation
of
brain
but
an
outsider
could
not
fail
to
note
that
with
this
destroying
of
a
natural
instinct
something
which
went
deeper
than
the
surface
was
also
lost
with
the
grace
of
the
body
certain
feminine
graces
of
soul
died
also
and
the
world
was
poorer
for
their
loss
the
untidy
servant
maid
peered
out
of
the
window
to
watch
claire
as
she
left
the
house
that
morning
and
evolved
a
whole
feuilleton
to
account
for
the
inconsistency
of
her
appearance
with
her
position
as
a
first
floor
front
you
take
her
for
a
lady
to
look
at
her
she
a
lady
in
disguise
and
from
this
point
the
making
of
the
feuilleton
began
the
service
that
morning
was
food
to
claire
hungering
soul
for
the
words
of
the
preacher
might
have
been
designed
to
meet
her
own
need
as
she
listened
she
realised
that
the
bitterness
of
loneliness
was
impossible
to
one
who
believed
and
trusted
in
the
great
love
sad
one
might
still
be
so
long
as
the
human
heart
demanded
a
human
companionship
but
the
sting
of
feeling
uncared
for
could
never
touch
a
child
of
god
she
took
the
comfort
home
to
her
heart
and
stored
it
there
to
help
her
through
the
difficult
time
ahead
and
on
her
knees
at
the
end
of
the
service
she
sent
up
her
own
little
petition
for
help
there
are
so
many
homes
in
this
great
city
is
there
no
home
for
me
on
christmas
day
with
the
words
the
tears
sprang
and
claire
mopped
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
thankful
that
she
was
surrounded
by
strangers
by
whom
her
reddened
eyes
would
pass
unnoticed
then
rising
to
her
feet
she
turned
to
lift
the
furs
which
hung
on
the
back
of
the
pew
and
met
the
brown
eyes
of
a
girl
who
had
been
sitting
behind
her
the
whole
of
the
service
the
girl
was
janet
willoughby
chapter
eleven
enter
major
carew
in
the
street
outside
the
church
door
the
two
girls
shook
hands
and
exchanged
greetings
janet
wore
a
long
fur
coat
and
a
toque
of
dark
russian
sable
with
a
sweeping
feather
at
one
side
the
price
of
these
two
garments
alone
would
equal
the
whole
of
claire
yearly
salary
but
it
had
the
effect
of
making
the
wearer
look
clumsy
and
compared
with
the
graceful
simplicity
of
the
other
costume
janet
willoughby
was
not
thinking
of
clothes
at
that
moment
however
she
was
looking
at
reddened
eyelids
and
remembering
the
moment
when
she
had
seen
a
kneeling
figure
suddenly
shaken
with
emotion
the
sight
of
those
tears
had
wiped
away
the
rankling
grudge
which
had
lain
at
her
heart
since
the
evening
of
her
mother
at
home
and
revived
the
warm
liking
which
at
first
sight
she
had
taken
to
this
pretty
attractive
girl
which
way
are
you
going
may
i
walk
with
you
it
just
the
morning
for
a
walk
i
hope
it
will
keep
cold
and
bright
over
christmas
so
inappropriate
when
it
muggy
last
year
we
were
in
switzerland
but
mother
is
and
likes
to
have
the
day
at
home
so
this
time
we
do
start
till
the
new
year
you
are
not
going
sporting
by
any
chance
i
not
said
claire
and
for
all
her
determination
could
not
resist
a
grimace
so
far
from
sporting
seemed
the
prospect
ahead
janet
caught
the
grimace
and
smiled
in
sympathy
but
the
next
moment
her
face
sobered
but
i
hope
you
going
to
have
jolly
holidays
oh
i
hope
so
oh
yes
i
mean
to
enjoy
them
very
much
claire
said
valiantly
and
swiftly
turned
the
subject
where
do
you
go
in
switzerland
saint
moritz
we
gone
there
for
years
a
large
party
of
friends
it
has
become
quite
a
yearly
reunion
it
so
comfy
to
have
one
own
party
and
be
independent
of
the
other
hoteliers
they
may
be
quite
nice
of
course
but
then
again
they
may
not
i
feel
rather
mean
sometimes
when
i
see
a
new
arrival
looking
with
big
eyes
at
our
merry
table
theoretically
i
think
one
to
be
nice
to
in
an
hotel
it
such
a
feeling
i
hate
it
myself
but
practically
i
afraid
i
not
particularly
friendly
we
are
so
complete
that
we
do
want
outsiders
they
spoil
the
fun
do
you
think
one
is
justified
in
being
a
little
bit
selfish
at
claire
laughed
her
old
happy
gurgling
laugh
it
warmed
her
heart
to
have
janet
willoughby
companionship
once
more
it
is
exactly
the
orthodox
attitude
is
it
perhaps
you
will
be
more
justified
this
year
after
you
have
got
through
your
christmas
duties
at
home
yes
that
a
good
idea
i
for
it
was
pure
unselfishness
which
prevented
me
running
away
last
week
with
the
rest
of
the
party
mother
would
have
given
in
if
i
persisted
and
i
wanted
to
so
dreadfully
badly
she
sighed
and
looked
quite
dejected
but
claire
remained
unmoved
i
do
pity
you
one
bit
you
have
only
a
week
to
wait
that
not
a
great
trial
of
patience
oh
yes
it
sometimes
said
janet
with
an
emphasis
which
gave
the
words
an
added
eloquence
claire
divined
at
once
that
switzerland
had
an
attraction
apart
from
winter
sports
an
attraction
centred
in
some
individual
member
of
the
merry
party
could
it
by
any
chance
be
erskine
fanshawe
she
longed
to
ask
the
question
not
for
a
hundred
pounds
would
she
have
asked
the
question
she
hoped
it
was
captain
fanshawe
she
hoped
janet
would
have
a
lovely
time
some
girls
had
everything
some
had
nothing
it
was
unfair
it
was
cruel
oh
dear
what
was
the
use
of
going
to
church
and
coming
out
to
have
such
mean
grudging
thoughts
janet
willoughby
too
such
a
dear
she
deserved
to
be
happy
claire
forced
a
smile
and
said
bravely
it
will
be
all
the
nicer
for
waiting
it
could
be
nicer
janet
replied
then
she
looked
in
the
other
girl
face
and
it
struck
her
that
the
pretty
eyelids
had
taken
an
additional
shade
of
red
and
her
warm
heart
felt
a
throb
of
compunction
grumbling
about
my
own
little
bothers
when
she
had
so
much
to
bear
hateful
of
me
i
been
mean
not
to
ask
her
again
mother
wanted
to
but
she
so
pretty
i
admired
her
so
much
that
i
was
afraid
other
people
might
too
but
she
was
crying
i
saw
her
cry
perhaps
she
is
lonely
and
it
my
fault
what
do
you
generally
do
on
sundays
she
asked
aloud
there
are
lots
of
other
mistresses
at
your
school
are
there
i
suppose
you
go
about
together
and
have
tea
at
each
other
rooms
in
the
afternoon
and
sit
over
the
fire
at
night
and
talk
and
brew
cocoa
as
the
girls
do
in
novels
it
all
sounds
so
interesting
the
girls
are
generally
rather
plain
and
very
learned
but
there
is
always
one
among
them
who
is
like
you
i
do
mean
that
you
are
not
learned
i
sure
you
are
but
er
pretty
you
know
and
attractive
and
fond
of
things
and
all
the
others
adore
her
and
are
jealous
if
she
is
nicer
to
one
than
to
the
others
claire
grimaced
again
more
unrestrainedly
than
before
that
not
my
part
i
wish
it
were
i
could
play
it
quite
well
the
other
mistresses
are
quite
civil
and
pleasant
but
they
do
hanker
after
me
one
bit
with
two
exceptions
the
girl
i
live
with
and
one
other
i
have
not
spoken
to
one
of
them
out
of
school
hours
i
even
know
where
most
of
them
live
janet
face
lengthened
suddenly
she
turned
and
asked
a
sharp
direct
question
where
are
you
going
on
christmas
day
pride
and
weakness
struggled
together
in
claire
heart
and
pride
won
she
would
pose
as
an
object
of
pity
oh
i
going
out
said
she
with
an
air
but
janet
willoughby
was
not
to
be
put
off
so
easily
as
that
her
brown
eyes
sent
out
a
flash
of
light
she
demanded
sternly
where
really
claire
tossed
her
head
with
the
air
of
a
duchess
who
was
so
overburdened
with
invitations
that
she
found
it
impossible
to
make
a
choice
between
them
really
do
you
know
i
have
quite
decided
claire
gifford
you
mean
horrid
girl
do
dare
to
quibble
you
are
going
nowhere
and
you
know
it
nobody
has
invited
you
for
christmas
day
that
why
you
were
crying
just
now
because
you
had
nowhere
to
go
and
you
would
have
gone
away
this
morning
and
said
nothing
and
sat
alone
in
your
rooms
i
call
it
talk
of
the
spirit
of
christmas
it
an
insult
to
me
and
to
mother
how
do
you
suppose
we
should
have
felt
if
we
found
out
else
could
i
do
how
could
i
tell
you
stammered
claire
blushing
it
would
have
seemed
such
a
barefaced
and
i
detest
hints
and
really
why
should
you
have
felt
bad
i
a
stranger
you
only
seen
me
once
there
could
be
no
blame
on
you
there
no
blame
on
anyone
it
just
happens
that
it
does
quite
fit
in
to
visit
friends
at
a
distance
and
in
town
well
i
a
stranger
you
see
i
no
friends
janet
set
her
lips
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
i
should
like
to
know
exactly
what
you
going
to
do
you
said
i
believe
that
you
were
going
out
and
now
you
say
you
had
nowhere
to
go
both
statements
ca
be
true
oh
yes
they
can
i
have
nowhere
to
go
but
i
had
to
find
somewhere
because
my
good
landlady
is
going
to
her
mother
at
highgate
and
disapproves
of
lodgers
who
stay
in
on
christmas
day
she
gave
me
notice
that
i
must
go
out
as
the
house
would
be
locked
up
but
where
what
where
you
go
i
thought
of
a
restaurant
and
a
concert
and
a
station
to
fill
in
the
gaps
quite
comfortable
you
know
they
have
lovely
fires
and
with
a
nice
book
if
you
do
stop
this
minute
i
shall
begin
to
cry
here
in
the
open
street
cried
janet
hotly
oh
you
poor
dear
you
poor
dear
a
station
i
never
heard
of
anything
so
piteous
oh
how
thankful
i
am
that
i
met
you
tell
me
honestly
was
it
about
that
that
you
were
crying
it
was
i
was
saying
a
little
prayer
and
trying
not
to
feel
lonesome
and
then
i
looked
round
and
saw
you
end
of
volume
one
cried
janet
briskly
no
more
my
dear
you
must
come
to
us
for
the
whole
of
christmas
day
i
wish
i
could
ask
you
to
stay
but
we
are
with
cousins
and
aunts
i
come
round
in
my
car
in
time
to
take
you
to
church
and
send
you
back
at
night
after
the
highgate
revels
are
over
we
ca
offer
you
anything
very
exciting
i
afraid
just
an
homey
gathering
it
just
what
i
want
i
am
thirsty
for
a
home
but
your
mother
what
will
she
say
will
she
care
for
a
stranger
mother
says
what
i
say
janet
declared
with
the
assurance
of
an
only
daughter
and
she
say
in
addition
a
blessing
whistle
for
us
and
amuse
aunt
jane
did
you
realise
that
aunt
jane
was
coming
she
generally
cross
all
day
and
makes
a
point
of
giving
away
her
presents
to
other
members
of
the
party
under
the
very
noses
of
the
givers
to
let
them
see
what
she
thinks
of
their
choice
the
great
idea
is
to
sit
down
by
her
quickly
when
you
see
her
begin
to
fumble
with
something
you
would
like
to
have
i
got
quite
a
nice
bag
that
way
last
christmas
presents
that
was
another
idea
claire
went
home
mentally
reviewing
her
own
treasures
with
a
view
to
selecting
some
trifle
which
janet
in
the
midst
of
her
plenty
might
still
be
glad
to
receive
she
decided
on
a
silver
clasp
of
quaint
breton
manufacture
which
had
the
merit
that
in
the
whole
of
london
it
would
be
impossible
to
purchase
another
to
match
claire
returned
to
her
room
in
a
frame
of
mind
vastly
different
from
that
in
which
she
had
started
forth
her
buoyant
spirits
soared
upwards
at
the
prospect
of
a
christmas
spent
in
the
midst
of
a
happy
family
party
and
all
the
difficulties
of
life
seemed
to
dissolve
into
thin
air
since
after
the
providential
meeting
just
vouchsafed
it
seemed
faithless
to
doubt
that
future
difficulties
would
be
solved
in
the
same
way
she
intended
to
devote
the
afternoon
to
writing
a
long
letter
to
her
mother
which
had
been
delayed
owing
to
her
recent
depression
of
spirits
for
it
seemed
cruel
to
write
in
a
pessimistic
strain
to
the
happy
bride
who
now
more
than
ever
saw
everything
de
mrs
judge
present
had
arrived
the
week
before
in
the
shape
of
a
richly
embroidered
indian
for
which
her
daughter
had
as
much
use
as
she
herself
would
have
found
for
a
fur
rug
to
use
it
in
the
saffron
parlour
was
a
sheer
impossibility
for
every
separate
article
of
furniture
shrieked
at
it
and
it
shrieked
at
them
in
return
so
claire
folded
it
away
at
the
bottom
of
her
box
reflecting
between
a
sigh
and
a
smile
that
the
choice
was
just
like
mother
it
was
not
agreeable
to
the
bride
to
picture
her
daughter
living
in
an
ugly
parlour
so
she
had
mentally
covered
the
ugliness
beneath
the
gorgeous
embroidery
of
that
cloth
and
happily
dismissed
the
subject
from
her
mind
at
the
time
of
the
opening
of
the
parcel
claire
had
felt
a
sense
of
sharp
disappointment
amounting
even
to
irritation
but
this
morning
she
could
see
the
humour
of
the
situation
and
she
chuckled
softly
to
herself
as
she
walked
homeward
rehearsing
words
of
thanks
that
would
be
at
once
cordial
and
truthful
just
what
i
wanted
was
plainly
out
of
the
question
so
useful
was
also
ruled
out
but
she
could
honestly
admire
the
workmanship
of
the
cloth
and
enlarge
on
the
care
with
which
it
should
be
preserved
it
was
an
easy
task
to
satisfy
a
correspondent
who
was
eager
to
interpret
words
into
the
meaning
most
agreeable
to
herself
claire
entered
the
house
prepared
to
devote
herself
to
writing
letters
to
absent
friends
but
the
excitements
of
the
day
were
not
yet
over
for
the
little
maid
met
her
on
the
threshold
with
the
exciting
intelligence
that
a
gentleman
was
in
the
parlour
waiting
to
see
her
the
feuilleton
made
an
exciting
leap
forward
as
lizzie
watched
the
blood
rush
into
the
first
floor
cheeks
and
ebb
away
suddenly
leaving
her
white
and
tense
struck
all
of
a
heap
like
i
have
thought
meself
as
she
look
at
him
queer
thing
love
soliloquised
lizzie
as
she
clumped
down
the
kitchen
stairs
and
returned
to
her
superintendence
of
sunday
jint
the
first
floor
meanwhile
stood
motionless
in
the
hall
struggling
to
regain
before
turning
the
handle
of
the
door
a
gentleman
waiting
to
see
her
who
could
the
gentleman
be
but
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
claire
believed
the
question
to
be
superfluous
for
there
was
only
one
gentleman
who
could
possibly
come
captain
fanshawe
had
found
out
her
address
and
it
was
when
a
visitor
was
justified
in
counting
on
a
hospitable
reception
at
it
would
be
churlish
for
a
hostess
to
deny
a
welcome
every
pulse
in
claire
body
was
throbbing
with
anticipation
as
she
flung
open
that
door
the
visitor
was
standing
with
his
back
towards
her
bending
low
to
examine
a
photograph
on
the
mantelpiece
at
the
sound
of
her
entrance
he
straightened
himself
and
wheeled
round
and
at
the
sight
of
his
face
claire
heart
dropped
heavy
as
lead
they
stood
for
a
moment
staring
in
a
mutual
surprise
the
girl
face
blank
with
disappointment
the
man
brightening
with
interest
he
was
a
tall
man
trim
and
smart
in
his
attire
yet
with
a
coarseness
of
feature
which
aroused
claire
instant
antagonism
compared
with
the
face
she
had
expected
to
see
the
florid
good
looks
which
confronted
her
were
positively
repugnant
before
the
obvious
admiration
of
the
black
eyes
she
stiffened
in
displeasure
you
wished
to
see
me
miss
gifford
i
believe
i
called
about
a
little
matter
of
a
parcel
for
miss
rhodes
to
be
sent
on
i
wanted
to
ask
if
you
oh
certainly
i
shall
be
delighted
claire
thawed
at
the
prospect
of
a
present
for
cecil
but
could
it
be
possible
that
it
was
this
man
with
the
flushed
cheeks
and
harsh
uncultivated
voice
who
had
so
revolutionised
cecil
life
could
it
be
for
the
delectation
of
those
bold
eyes
that
she
had
worked
far
into
the
night
contriving
her
pitiful
fineries
claire
instinctive
dislike
was
so
strong
that
she
would
not
seat
herself
and
so
give
an
opportunity
for
prolonging
the
interview
she
crossed
the
room
to
a
bureau
that
stood
in
the
corner
and
took
a
slip
of
paper
from
one
of
the
holes
perhaps
it
would
be
simpler
if
i
gave
you
the
address
the
man
laughed
complacently
no
need
thank
you
i
got
it
all
right
but
it
safer
not
to
write
the
old
lady
you
know
parcel
coming
in
for
her
daughter
addressed
in
a
man
writing
no
end
of
fuss
and
questioning
you
know
what
old
ladies
are
never
satisfied
till
they
ferreted
to
the
bottom
of
everything
that
comes
along
it
not
good
enough
that
sort
of
thing
but
she
expect
a
present
it
all
stamped
and
made
up
if
you
be
good
enough
just
to
address
it
and
slip
it
into
the
post
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
as
he
spoke
and
drew
out
a
little
package
some
two
inches
square
the
sort
of
package
which
might
contain
an
article
of
jewellery
such
as
a
brooch
or
ring
could
it
by
any
chance
be
an
engagement
ring
claire
blood
shuddered
as
she
took
the
little
packet
and
dropped
it
quietly
on
the
bureau
certainly
i
will
post
it
do
you
wish
it
registered
he
looked
at
her
sharply
as
though
suspicious
of
an
to
the
inquiry
then
meeting
the
glance
of
her
clear
eyes
had
the
grace
to
look
ashamed
no
it
is
not
worth
while
a
trifle
just
a
trifle
christmas
you
know
must
do
the
proper
thing
he
mumbled
vaguely
the
while
he
collected
his
hat
and
gloves
the
aloofness
in
claire
attitude
making
it
impossible
to
prolong
the
interview
but
as
he
held
out
his
hand
in
farewell
his
returned
he
laughed
meaningly
and
said
odd
you
know
i
imagined
that
you
were
quite
old
miss
rhodes
gave
me
that
impression
nothing
definite
you
know
no
false
statements
just
the
way
she
spoke
clever
of
her
what
very
clever
knew
better
than
to
spoil
her
own
game
if
looks
could
have
slain
the
saffron
parlour
would
have
seen
a
dead
man
at
that
moment
claire
withdrew
her
hand
and
surreptitiously
rubbed
it
against
her
skirt
she
would
not
condescend
to
notice
that
last
remark
i
post
the
parcel
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
your
name
as
i
shall
have
to
explain
he
drew
out
a
and
extracted
a
card
claire
dropped
it
unread
upon
the
table
and
bowed
stiffly
in
farewell
the
next
moment
he
was
gone
and
she
could
satisfy
her
curiosity
unseen
then
came
surprise
number
two
for
the
card
bore
the
inscription
major
carew
and
in
the
corner
two
words
carlton
club
an
officer
in
the
army
who
would
have
thought
it
he
was
emphatically
not
a
gentleman
he
was
rough
coarse
mannerless
yet
he
was
in
a
position
which
would
bring
him
into
intimate
association
with
gentle
people
by
a
strange
coincidence
he
might
know
he
almost
certainly
would
know
the
man
whom
she
had
expected
to
see
in
his
stead
erskine
fanshawe
himself
they
could
never
be
friends
but
they
would
meet
they
would
sit
in
the
same
rooms
they
would
exchange
occasional
remarks
claire
mood
of
intolerable
disgust
changed
suddenly
into
something
strangely
approaching
envy
of
this
big
rough
man
christmas
morning
brought
janet
bright
and
early
to
find
claire
standing
at
the
window
ready
to
rush
out
the
moment
the
car
stopped
at
the
door
it
felt
delightfully
luxurious
to
seat
herself
on
the
springy
cushions
draw
the
fur
rug
over
her
knees
and
feel
the
warmth
of
a
hot
tin
beneath
her
feet
it
lacerating
janet
cried
just
as
i
was
starting
the
parcel
post
arrived
and
there
were
about
parcels
for
me
from
saint
moritz
there
was
no
time
to
open
them
and
i
simply
die
to
know
what
inside
i
care
about
those
presents
more
than
anything
else
we
had
our
family
presents
this
morning
mother
gave
me
this
she
opened
her
coat
to
show
a
glittering
crescent
quite
pretty
it
but
i
rather
have
had
pearls
that
the
worst
of
christmas
presents
you
so
seldom
get
what
you
want
half
the
time
you
feel
more
disappointed
than
pleased
people
cling
to
the
idea
that
they
ought
to
give
you
a
surprise
and
you
surprised
but
not
in
the
way
they
expect
i
have
given
mother
thousands
of
hints
about
pearls
ah
well
she
hooked
the
coat
with
an
air
of
resignation
we
must
take
the
will
for
the
deed
have
you
had
nice
things
my
mother
sent
me
a
very
handsome
present
claire
said
demurely
she
had
no
personal
agitations
about
the
day
post
but
she
did
feel
interested
in
the
thought
of
those
parcels
from
switzerland
which
lay
awaiting
janet
willoughby
return
half
eager
half
shrinking
she
looked
forward
to
seeing
their
contents
it
was
in
janet
dainty
boudoir
that
the
unpacking
took
place
the
two
girls
went
straight
upstairs
on
their
return
from
church
and
there
on
a
table
lay
the
pile
of
parcels
which
had
arrived
by
the
morning
delivery
janet
pounced
upon
the
swiss
packets
and
cut
the
fastenings
with
eager
haste
from
across
the
room
claire
watched
her
eager
face
as
she
read
the
inscriptions
one
by
one
as
she
neared
the
end
of
the
pile
the
eagerness
became
tinged
with
anxiety
she
picked
up
the
last
parcel
of
all
and
the
light
died
out
of
her
face
claire
turned
aside
and
affected
to
be
absorbed
in
examining
the
contents
of
an
old
cabinet
and
janet
moved
to
the
nearer
side
of
the
table
so
that
her
face
was
hidden
from
view
after
a
few
minutes
of
silence
she
broke
the
silence
in
a
voice
of
forced
lightness
wo
you
come
and
look
at
my
trophies
switzerland
is
not
a
very
happy
for
there
is
so
little
variety
to
be
had
my
fifth
carved
chalet
and
about
the
seventeenth
bear
rather
a
dear
though
is
he
such
a
nice
man
sent
it
one
of
the
nicest
of
men
that
his
photograph
on
the
mantelpiece
claire
looked
met
a
straight
keen
glance
which
lived
in
her
memory
and
felt
a
tingle
of
blood
in
her
cheeks
janet
eyes
followed
hers
and
she
said
quickly
not
that
that
erskine
fanshawe
he
is
a
casual
person
and
go
in
for
presents
he
has
even
troubled
to
send
a
card
i
meant
the
man
in
the
leather
frame
he
always
remembers
i
do
like
that
in
a
man
they
are
all
good
enough
in
an
emergency
but
so
few
of
them
think
of
the
nice
things
janet
sighed
and
dropped
the
carved
wooden
bear
on
to
the
table
however
much
she
might
appreciate
the
donor
thoughtfulness
it
had
not
had
a
cheering
effect
the
light
had
died
out
of
her
eyes
and
she
turned
over
the
various
trophies
without
a
trace
of
the
enthusiasm
with
which
she
had
torn
open
the
parcel
claire
standing
beside
her
felt
torn
between
sympathy
and
a
guilty
sense
of
relief
she
was
sorry
for
janet
obvious
disappointment
but
she
was
also
it
was
a
feeling
for
how
could
it
possibly
affect
herself
that
captain
fanshawe
was
not
the
donor
of
the
bear
as
the
two
girls
stood
together
turning
over
the
little
collection
of
carved
toys
claire
slipped
her
hand
through
janet
arm
with
an
affectionate
pressure
which
was
an
outward
apology
for
the
inward
disloyalty
and
janet
stretched
out
her
own
hand
to
clasp
it
with
unexpected
fervour
oh
i
am
glad
you
are
here
i
glad
to
have
another
girl
girls
understand
i
wish
i
had
opened
those
horrid
old
parcels
it
just
as
i
said
presents
are
disappointing
now
i
feel
thoroughly
humped
and
dumpy
it
so
stupid
too
for
i
know
quite
well
that
i
every
sane
reason
to
be
pleased
how
exasperating
it
is
that
one
head
and
heart
so
seldom
agree
claire
gave
the
plump
arm
another
squeeze
but
made
no
further
answer
she
was
afraid
to
show
how
well
she
understood
janet
would
forget
her
hasty
words
and
believe
that
her
secret
was
locked
within
her
own
breast
but
the
other
girl
realised
the
position
as
clearly
as
if
she
had
been
told
in
so
many
words
i
am
in
love
with
one
man
and
another
man
is
in
love
with
me
i
am
throwing
away
the
substance
for
the
shadow
ah
well
such
is
life
continued
janet
sighing
now
i
supposed
to
go
downstairs
and
be
the
life
of
the
party
how
i
do
dislike
family
parties
mother
says
it
the
ideal
thing
for
relations
to
gather
together
for
christmas
day
but
i
been
gathered
together
for
so
years
you
are
too
my
dear
that
what
the
matter
i
have
never
met
a
girl
before
who
had
so
much
to
make
her
happy
and
yet
you
are
not
satisfied
how
would
you
like
to
be
a
high
living
in
poky
lodgings
not
able
to
have
a
holiday
because
she
ca
afford
two
rents
and
getting
only
one
present
all
told
janet
looked
at
her
quickly
have
you
had
only
one
i
said
high
not
any
special
mistress
but
i
will
be
definite
if
you
like
how
would
you
like
to
be
janet
turned
suddenly
laid
her
free
hand
on
claire
shoulder
and
stared
deeply
into
her
face
i
do
know
she
said
slowly
sometimes
i
think
it
just
what
i
should
like
i
have
a
great
deal
but
you
have
more
look
at
our
two
faces
in
that
glass
she
drew
claire
round
so
that
they
stood
in
front
of
the
chippendale
mirror
over
the
mantelpiece
from
whence
a
row
of
pictured
faces
stared
back
as
though
stolidly
sitting
in
judgment
the
clear
tints
of
claire
skin
made
janet
look
sallow
and
faded
the
dark
curve
of
her
eyebrows
under
the
sweep
of
gold
brown
hair
the
red
lips
and
deeply
cleft
chin
made
janet
indeterminate
features
look
insignificant
the
brown
eyes
seemed
the
only
definite
feature
in
her
face
and
they
were
clouded
with
depression
look
at
yourself
she
said
deeply
and
look
at
me
it
was
an
awkward
moment
and
claire
shrugged
uncomfortably
but
my
face
is
it
has
to
be
my
fortune
oh
beauty
i
was
thinking
of
beauty
janet
cried
unexpectedly
you
are
very
pretty
of
course
but
heaps
of
girls
are
pretty
something
more
i
suppose
it
is
what
is
called
charm
when
people
see
you
once
they
remember
you
they
want
to
see
you
again
you
make
a
place
for
yourself
i
am
one
in
a
crowd
people
like
me
well
enough
when
they
are
with
me
but
they
forget
and
i
never
meet
anyone
to
remember
we
two
damsels
and
this
is
merrie
christmas
would
you
have
thought
it
cried
claire
and
that
wrought
the
desired
effect
for
janet
awoke
with
a
shock
to
her
responsibilities
as
hostess
and
led
the
way
downstairs
to
join
the
rest
of
the
the
rest
of
the
day
was
spent
in
conventional
english
fashion
in
a
praiseworthy
effort
to
sustain
spirits
at
concert
pitch
and
keep
up
a
continuous
flow
of
gaiety
a
mountainous
task
when
guests
are
brought
together
by
claims
of
birth
without
consideration
as
to
suitability
mrs
willoughby
party
consisted
of
four
distinct
elements
there
were
jane
and
second
cousin
william
two
octogenarians
who
for
health
sake
dined
early
all
the
year
round
and
sipped
a
cup
of
benger
at
eight
but
who
dauntlessly
tackled
sausages
and
plum
pudding
on
christmas
day
and
suffered
for
it
for
a
week
to
come
there
were
mr
and
mrs
willoughby
and
two
cousin
husbands
and
their
wives
and
a
spinster
aunt
to
represent
the
next
generation
then
came
sweet
and
twenty
as
represented
by
janet
and
claire
followed
by
reginald
of
eton
on
whom
they
looked
down
as
a
mere
boy
the
while
he
in
his
turn
disdained
to
notice
the
advances
of
two
cousins
of
nine
and
ten
claire
enjoyed
herself
because
it
was
in
her
nature
to
enjoy
and
it
felt
good
to
be
once
more
in
a
beautiful
home
among
friends
but
driving
home
in
the
taxi
she
yawned
persistently
from
one
door
to
the
other
it
was
dreadfully
tiring
work
being
pleasant
at
the
same
time
to
the
whole
five
ages
of
man
with
the
opening
of
the
door
of
the
saffron
parlour
came
an
end
of
sleepiness
for
on
the
table
lay
a
square
parcel
and
the
parcel
bore
the
same
stamp
the
same
markings
which
she
had
seen
duplicated
in
janet
willoughby
boudoir
red
as
a
rose
was
claire
as
she
stared
at
the
bold
masculine
writing
of
the
address
tore
open
the
wrappings
of
the
box
and
drew
forth
a
carved
cuckoo
clock
with
the
chalet
roof
and
long
pendulum
and
chains
it
was
an
exquisite
specimen
of
its
kind
the
best
that
could
be
obtained
but
for
the
moment
claire
had
no
attention
to
spare
for
the
gift
itself
she
was
absorbed
in
hunting
among
the
paper
and
straw
for
a
card
which
should
settle
the
identity
of
the
donor
not
a
line
was
to
be
found
pink
deepened
to
crimson
on
claire
cheeks
who
in
the
world
could
have
sent
it
who
it
be
she
played
at
bewilderment
but
in
spite
of
herself
the
dimples
dipped
now
how
in
the
world
has
he
found
out
my
address
asked
claire
of
herself
for
the
next
week
claire
experienced
the
sensation
of
being
alone
in
london
from
the
evening
of
christmas
day
until
cecil
returned
on
january
not
one
friendly
word
did
she
hear
she
walked
abroad
among
a
crowd
of
unknown
faces
she
returned
to
a
solitary
room
miss
farnborough
was
spending
the
christmas
abroad
the
other
mistresses
were
either
visiting
or
entertaining
relations
the
ladies
of
the
committee
were
presumably
making
merry
each
in
her
own
sphere
it
was
no
one
business
to
look
after
the
new
member
of
the
staff
out
of
term
time
and
no
one
troubled
to
make
it
her
business
the
only
friendly
sound
which
reached
claire
ears
during
those
days
was
the
striking
of
the
cuckoo
clock
as
a
minute
before
every
hour
a
sliding
door
flew
open
and
a
little
brown
bird
popped
out
and
piped
the
due
number
of
cuckoos
in
a
clear
sweet
note
claire
loved
that
little
bird
the
sight
of
him
brought
a
warmth
to
her
heart
which
was
as
sunshine
lighting
up
the
grey
winter
days
someone
had
remembered
someone
had
cared
in
the
midst
of
a
merry
holiday
time
and
thought
had
been
spared
for
her
benefit
the
presence
of
the
cuckoo
clock
preserved
claire
from
personal
suffering
but
during
that
silent
week
there
was
borne
in
upon
her
a
realisation
of
the
loneliness
of
the
great
city
which
was
never
obliterated
a
girl
like
herself
coming
to
london
without
introductions
might
lead
this
desert
life
not
for
a
week
alone
but
for
her
youth
might
fade
might
pass
away
she
might
grow
and
old
and
still
pass
to
and
fro
through
crowded
street
unnoted
uncared
for
unknown
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
schoolroom
or
the
office
walls
a
was
as
a
rule
too
tired
and
too
poor
to
join
societies
or
take
part
in
social
work
which
would
lead
to
the
making
of
friends
she
was
dependent
on
the
thoughtfulness
of
her
leisured
sisters
and
the
leisured
sisters
were
too
apt
to
forget
they
invited
their
own
friends
exhausted
themselves
in
organising
entertainments
which
were
often
regarded
as
bores
pure
and
simple
and
cast
no
thought
to
the
lonely
women
sitting
night
after
night
in
parlours
if
i
am
ever
rich
if
i
ever
have
a
home
remember
claire
vowed
to
herself
i
take
a
little
trouble
and
i
could
do
a
hundredth
or
a
thousandth
part
of
what
ought
to
be
done
but
i
do
my
share
cecil
announced
her
return
for
the
evening
of
january
and
remindful
of
the
depressing
influence
of
her
own
arrival
claire
exerted
herself
to
make
the
room
look
as
homelike
as
possible
and
arranged
a
dainty
little
meal
on
a
table
spread
with
a
clean
cloth
and
decorated
with
a
bowl
of
holly
and
christmas
roses
at
the
first
sound
of
cecil
voice
she
ran
out
into
the
hall
hugged
her
warmly
and
relieved
her
of
a
bundle
of
packages
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
you
look
a
real
mother
christmas
hidden
behind
parcels
what
are
they
all
trophies
you
come
off
well
it
is
lovely
to
see
you
back
if
you
stayed
away
the
whole
time
i
think
i
should
have
grown
dumb
my
tongue
would
have
withered
from
sheer
lack
of
use
i
never
realised
before
how
much
i
love
to
talk
i
do
hope
you
feel
sociable
i
want
to
talk
and
talk
for
hours
at
a
time
and
to
hear
talk
too
even
to
grumble
claire
grinned
eloquently
oh
well
if
you
but
it
would
be
rather
mean
would
it
after
a
holiday
and
when
i
got
everything
so
nice
i
am
driven
to
praise
myself
because
take
no
notice
you
have
given
me
no
time
you
chatter
so
that
no
one
else
can
get
in
a
word
cecil
took
off
hat
and
gloves
and
threw
them
down
on
the
sofa
i
must
say
your
looks
do
pity
you
you
look
as
if
you
had
been
enjoying
yourself
all
right
that
kettle
boiling
i
dying
for
a
cup
of
tea
let
have
it
at
once
and
talk
comfortably
she
seated
herself
by
the
table
and
helped
herself
to
a
buttered
scone
what
did
you
do
on
christmas
day
the
willoughbys
asked
me
i
went
to
church
with
them
and
stayed
until
eleven
anything
going
on
or
just
the
ordinary
family
frumps
claire
laughed
nobody
but
relations
and
my
fascinating
self
but
you
need
be
so
blighting
i
enjoyed
every
moment
and
they
were
angelically
kind
janet
was
like
an
old
friend
did
she
give
you
a
present
yes
she
did
half
a
dozen
pairs
of
gloves
the
wrong
size
of
course
they
always
are
no
my
pessimist
they
were
not
she
had
diagnosed
me
as
a
six
and
a
half
and
six
and
a
half
i
am
so
all
was
peace
and
joy
i
put
on
a
new
pair
the
next
day
when
i
went
out
for
a
constitutional
it
was
quite
a
tonic
gloves
are
much
cheaper
abroad
and
i
never
wore
a
shabby
pair
in
my
life
until
this
winter
it
been
one
of
the
things
i
hated
most
six
pairs
will
soon
go
said
cecil
i
prefer
to
have
things
that
last
oh
by
the
way
you
addressed
a
parcel
how
did
it
come
was
it
left
at
the
door
instinctively
claire
busied
herself
over
the
she
had
a
feeling
that
cecil
would
rather
be
unobserved
she
was
also
afraid
that
her
own
expression
might
betray
too
much
oh
no
he
called
when
i
came
in
after
morning
church
on
sunday
lizzie
said
that
a
gentleman
was
waiting
it
was
major
carew
he
asked
me
if
i
would
address
the
parcel
and
send
it
on
silence
claire
bent
over
the
but
she
knew
without
looking
that
cecil
face
had
fallen
into
the
cold
set
lines
which
she
had
seen
times
and
again
when
things
had
gone
wrong
she
knew
that
when
she
spoke
again
the
coldness
would
be
in
her
voice
but
her
own
conscience
was
clear
she
had
done
nothing
to
offend
really
that
curious
you
say
you
did
ask
him
in
what
did
he
say
he
said
gifford
i
presume
i
have
called
to
ask
if
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
address
a
small
parcel
for
miss
rhodes
i
said
it
be
better
if
i
gave
you
her
address
he
said
should
prefer
if
you
wrote
it
yourself
i
said
will
do
so
with
pleasure
good
morning
he
said
morning
he
then
took
up
his
hat
and
departed
he
showed
himself
out
and
shut
the
door
after
him
i
went
upstairs
and
took
off
my
things
he
did
stay
long
then
about
three
minutes
i
should
say
perhaps
four
i
ca
tell
you
to
a
second
unfortunately
i
did
look
at
the
clock
cecil
laughed
half
apologetic
half
relieved
oh
well
you
need
be
sarcastic
naturally
i
wanted
to
know
i
could
make
it
out
when
i
saw
your
writing
for
you
had
given
me
the
scarf
i
going
to
buy
your
present
at
the
sales
by
the
way
but
of
course
when
i
took
off
the
paper
there
was
a
message
inside
i
was
expecting
that
present
i
hope
it
was
very
nice
oh
yes
yes
a
brooch
cecil
said
carelessly
claire
hoped
it
was
not
the
insignificant
little
golden
bar
which
she
was
wearing
at
the
moment
but
she
had
never
seen
it
before
and
cecil
jewellery
was
of
the
most
limited
description
she
determined
to
ask
no
more
questions
on
the
subject
since
evidently
none
were
desired
cecil
helped
herself
to
a
second
scone
and
asked
suddenly
why
did
he
sit
down
it
was
necessary
was
it
he
gave
his
message
and
then
there
was
nothing
to
say
i
was
going
to
make
conversation
you
did
like
him
cried
cecil
but
she
laughed
as
she
spoke
and
her
face
relaxed
it
was
evident
that
she
was
more
pleased
than
disconcerted
at
her
friend
lack
of
approval
you
no
good
at
hiding
your
feelings
claire
your
voice
gives
you
away
as
well
as
your
face
did
you
like
major
carew
i
suppose
you
do
deny
that
he
is
a
handsome
man
i
do
think
i
care
about
handsome
men
said
claire
seeing
before
her
a
face
which
could
lay
no
claims
to
beauty
but
in
comparison
with
which
the
major
coarse
good
looks
were
abhorrent
in
her
eyes
prefer
men
plain
i
suppose
well
i
do
i
should
like
frank
half
so
much
if
he
did
look
so
big
and
imposing
and
other
people
admire
him
too
people
stare
at
him
as
we
pass
i
suppose
you
have
guessed
that
it
is
with
him
that
i
been
going
out
there
did
seem
any
need
to
speak
of
it
before
but
during
the
rest
of
the
holidays
you
might
expect
me
to
go
about
with
you
and
sometimes
often
i
hope
be
engaged
so
it
just
as
well
to
explain
we
can
do
things
together
in
the
morning
but
naturally
yes
of
course
i
quite
understand
do
worry
about
me
cecil
love
you
to
have
a
good
time
are
you
are
you
engaged
to
him
dear
there
was
in
her
voice
that
soft
almost
awed
note
with
which
an
unengaged
girl
regards
a
companion
who
has
actually
plighted
her
troth
cecil
softened
at
the
sound
well
i
suppose
we
are
between
ourselves
it
not
public
yet
but
i
think
it
soon
will
be
half
a
dozen
years
ago
i
should
have
been
sure
but
i
know
better
now
you
can
never
be
sure
men
are
such
brutes
they
think
of
nothing
but
themselves
and
their
own
amusement
some
men
most
men
of
course
every
girl
who
falls
in
love
thinks
her
own
particular
man
is
the
exception
and
believes
in
him
blindly
until
she
gets
her
heart
broken
for
her
pains
i
believed
in
a
man
too
years
ago
when
i
was
not
much
older
than
you
are
now
she
paused
as
though
waiting
for
comment
but
claire
sat
silent
listening
with
grave
tender
eyes
cecil
sent
her
a
flickering
smile
you
are
a
nice
child
claire
you
have
some
sense
i
tell
you
because
you
never
pried
or
asked
questions
you
would
never
have
got
anything
out
of
me
that
way
but
sometimes
i
feel
as
if
it
would
be
a
relief
to
talk
i
was
and
very
pretty
not
as
pretty
as
you
are
perhaps
but
very
nearly
and
he
was
a
lawyer
brother
of
one
of
the
girls
he
came
to
one
of
the
and
we
were
introduced
after
that
he
made
his
people
invite
me
once
or
twice
and
he
found
out
where
i
was
going
in
the
summer
holidays
and
came
down
to
the
same
inn
he
stayed
a
fortnight
cecil
sighed
and
stared
dreamily
at
her
cup
even
now
claire
after
all
that
has
happened
i
can
never
quite
make
up
my
mind
to
be
sorry
that
he
came
it
made
things
harder
when
the
parting
came
but
i
had
for
two
whole
weeks
i
had
been
as
perfectly
blissfully
happy
as
a
human
creature
can
be
i
had
wakened
every
morning
to
feel
that
life
was
too
good
to
be
true
i
had
gone
to
bed
every
night
grudging
the
time
for
sleep
a
fortnight
is
not
very
long
but
it
not
every
woman
who
gets
even
as
much
as
that
i
shall
never
feel
that
happiness
again
but
glad
that
i
know
what
it
is
like
but
cecil
dear
if
if
major
carew
cecil
shook
her
head
no
never
again
one
may
be
happy
enough
but
it
never
the
same
i
ca
feel
now
as
i
did
then
the
power
has
gone
i
cared
so
much
you
see
i
would
have
given
my
life
for
him
a
dozen
times
over
i
thought
of
him
night
and
day
for
over
a
year
i
lived
for
the
times
when
we
could
meet
it
was
very
often
for
his
people
had
taken
fright
and
would
not
ask
me
to
the
house
they
were
rich
people
and
did
want
him
to
marry
a
poor
girl
who
was
working
for
herself
it
a
great
mistake
claire
to
be
friends
with
a
man
when
his
relations
ignore
you
if
i
had
any
pride
i
would
have
realised
that
but
i
had
and
i
did
care
i
did
care
for
anything
but
just
to
see
him
and
do
what
he
wished
and
then
my
dear
after
a
year
he
began
to
change
he
did
write
to
me
for
weeks
and
i
had
to
go
to
school
every
day
and
try
to
think
of
the
work
and
be
patient
with
the
girls
and
seem
bright
and
interested
as
if
i
had
nothing
on
my
mind
it
was
near
time
and
we
were
rehearsing
a
play
i
used
to
feel
as
if
i
should
go
mad
staying
behind
after
four
to
go
over
those
wretched
scenes
when
i
was
panting
to
run
home
to
see
if
a
letter
had
come
but
each
time
that
we
met
again
i
forgot
everything
i
was
so
happy
that
i
had
no
time
to
grumble
that
surprises
you
does
it
you
can
hardly
believe
that
of
me
but
i
was
different
then
i
was
quite
nice
you
would
have
liked
me
if
you
had
known
me
then
dear
old
cecil
i
like
you
now
you
know
i
do
oh
you
put
up
with
me
we
get
along
well
enough
but
we
are
not
if
we
had
not
been
thrown
together
you
would
never
have
singled
me
out
do
apologise
my
dear
there
no
need
i
a
grumbling
old
thing
and
you
been
very
patient
well
that
how
it
happened
i
went
out
to
meet
him
one
night
and
he
told
me
quite
calmly
that
he
was
going
to
be
married
she
was
the
sweetest
girl
in
the
world
and
he
was
the
happiest
of
men
wanted
me
to
know
because
we
had
been
such
friends
and
he
was
sure
i
should
be
pleased
claire
drew
her
breath
with
a
sharp
sibilant
sound
and
oh
cecil
what
did
you
say
mary
rhodes
compressed
her
lips
the
set
look
was
in
her
face
i
said
what
i
thought
quite
plainly
and
simply
and
very
much
to
the
point
i
suppose
it
would
have
been
dignified
to
congratulate
him
and
pretend
to
be
delighted
but
i
could
do
it
he
had
broken
my
heart
for
his
own
amusement
and
he
knew
it
as
well
as
i
did
so
why
should
i
pretend
something
inside
me
seemed
to
go
snap
at
that
moment
and
been
sour
and
bitter
ever
since
but
i
learnt
lesson
and
that
is
that
it
is
folly
to
go
on
waiting
for
perfection
in
this
world
much
better
take
what
comes
along
and
make
the
best
of
it
claire
was
silent
applauding
the
sentiment
in
the
abstract
but
shrinking
from
its
application
to
the
swarthy
major
carew
she
stretched
her
hand
across
the
table
and
laid
it
caressingly
on
arm
dear
old
girl
it
no
use
saying
he
was
worth
having
that
no
comfort
when
you
have
loved
a
man
it
must
be
the
worst
blow
of
all
to
be
obliged
to
despise
him
but
men
are
not
all
like
that
cecil
you
must
condemn
them
all
because
of
one
bad
specimen
i
a
great
admiration
for
men
as
a
whole
they
are
than
women
i
mean
mentally
bigger
freer
from
mean
little
faults
as
a
rule
they
have
a
stricter
sense
of
honour
that
an
attitude
i
suppose
but
i
do
care
it
been
my
experience
and
i
can
only
speak
what
i
know
the
average
man
honourable
faithful
ah
you
are
speaking
of
your
experience
as
a
leisured
girl
a
girl
living
at
home
with
her
mother
behind
her
it
a
different
story
when
you
are
on
your
own
a
man
finds
it
pleasant
enough
to
be
friends
with
a
bachelor
girl
to
take
her
about
give
her
little
presents
and
play
the
fairy
prince
generally
the
dear
little
soul
is
so
grateful
cecil
voice
took
a
bitter
note
so
appreciative
of
his
condescension
he
can
enjoy
her
society
without
being
bothered
with
chaperons
and
conventions
it
is
really
an
uncommonly
jolly
way
of
passing
the
time
but
when
it
comes
to
does
he
want
to
the
bachelor
girl
claire
pushed
her
chair
from
the
table
her
face
looked
suddenly
white
and
tired
there
was
a
suspicious
quiver
in
her
voice
oh
cecil
do
do
you
are
poisoning
me
again
leave
me
faith
if
i
ca
believe
in
my
i
rather
die
at
once
and
be
done
with
it
it
stifles
me
to
breathe
the
atmosphere
of
distrust
and
suspicion
and
it
is
true
there
good
men
who
would
be
all
the
more
chivalrous
because
a
girl
was
alone
i
know
it
i
sure
of
it
i
refuse
to
believe
that
every
man
is
a
blackguard
because
you
have
had
an
unfortunate
experience
mary
rhodes
stared
abashed
since
the
night
when
claire
had
implored
her
not
to
poison
her
mind
she
had
never
seen
her
merry
companion
so
aroused
but
for
the
moment
regret
was
swamped
in
curiosity
ostensibly
claire
was
arguing
in
the
plural
but
in
reality
she
was
defending
a
definite
man
cecil
was
sure
of
it
saw
her
suspicion
confirmed
in
the
paling
cheeks
and
distended
eyes
heard
it
confirmed
in
the
shaking
voice
but
who
could
the
man
be
claire
was
the
most
candid
the
most
open
of
colleagues
she
loved
to
talk
and
describe
any
experiences
which
came
her
way
every
time
she
returned
from
an
afternoon
in
town
she
had
a
dozen
amusing
incidents
to
recount
which
in
themselves
constituted
a
guide
to
her
doings
cecil
felt
satisfied
that
claire
had
had
no
masculine
escort
on
any
of
these
occasions
and
with
the
one
exception
of
mrs
willoughby
at
home
she
had
paid
no
social
visits
yet
there
did
exist
a
man
on
whose
honour
she
was
prepared
to
pin
her
faith
of
that
cecil
was
convinced
probably
it
was
someone
in
brussels
whom
she
was
still
hoping
to
meet
again
well
do
get
excited
she
said
coolly
if
you
choose
to
look
upon
life
as
a
fairy
tale
it
not
my
business
to
wake
you
up
the
sleeping
beauty
position
is
very
soothing
while
it
lasts
do
say
i
warn
you
that
all
i
do
call
it
exactly
to
try
to
prevent
another
girl
from
suffering
as
badly
as
one
has
suffered
oneself
perhaps
not
certainly
not
but
it
was
the
way
you
did
it
sorry
cecil
if
i
was
cross
i
hope
time
dear
all
will
go
well
and
that
you
be
very
very
happy
do
tell
me
anything
you
can
i
ask
questions
but
i
love
to
hear
cecil
laugh
had
rather
a
hard
intonation
oh
well
once
bitten
twice
shy
i
older
this
time
and
it
a
different
thing
perhaps
i
shall
be
all
the
happier
because
i
expect
too
much
he
very
devoted
and
he
be
rich
some
day
but
his
father
gives
him
no
allowance
which
makes
things
tight
just
now
he
is
an
erratic
old
man
almost
a
miser
but
there
are
pots
of
money
in
the
family
frank
showed
me
the
name
in
there
quite
a
paragraph
about
them
and
i
seen
a
picture
of
the
house
too
a
beautiful
place
and
he
the
eldest
son
it
in
surrey
quite
near
town
he
has
taken
you
down
to
see
it
not
yet
no
it
a
private
engagement
his
father
does
know
he
is
waiting
for
a
chance
to
tell
him
would
the
father
be
glad
for
his
heir
to
marry
he
would
be
glad
for
him
to
marry
but
the
estate
is
entailed
so
frank
can
do
as
he
likes
but
the
old
man
is
ill
always
having
asthma
and
heart
attacks
so
it
would
do
to
upset
him
and
of
course
till
he
knows
frank
ca
tell
any
other
members
of
the
family
claire
standing
by
the
fireplace
gave
a
vague
assent
and
was
glad
that
her
face
was
hidden
from
view
for
cecil
sake
she
intensely
wanted
to
believe
in
major
carew
and
his
account
of
his
own
position
but
instinctively
she
doubted
instinctively
she
feared
she
remembered
the
look
of
the
man
face
as
he
had
stood
facing
her
across
the
little
room
and
her
distrust
deepened
he
did
not
look
straight
he
did
not
look
true
probably
the
old
father
had
a
good
reason
for
keeping
him
short
of
money
if
he
were
really
in
love
with
cecil
and
determined
to
marry
her
that
was
so
much
to
his
credit
but
claire
hated
the
idea
of
that
secrecy
marvelled
that
cecil
could
submit
a
second
time
to
so
humiliating
a
position
poor
cecil
how
it
would
be
if
she
were
again
deceived
a
protective
impulse
stirred
in
claire
heart
she
sha
be
if
i
can
help
it
cried
the
inner
voice
at
that
moment
she
vowed
herself
to
the
service
of
mary
rhodes
a
big
country
house
in
surrey
that
the
ideal
residence
of
the
heroine
of
fiction
it
does
sound
romantic
cecil
i
should
love
to
think
of
you
as
the
mistress
of
a
house
like
that
come
and
sit
by
the
fire
and
let
us
talk
it
so
exciting
to
talk
of
love
affairs
instead
of
exercises
and
exams
let
pretend
we
are
just
two
happy
ordinary
girls
with
no
looming
ahead
and
that
one
of
us
is
just
engaged
and
telling
the
other
about
it
now
begin
begin
at
the
beginning
how
did
you
meet
him
first
but
there
a
difficulty
arose
for
cecil
grew
suddenly
red
and
stumbled
over
her
words
oh
well
i
we
it
was
an
accident
quite
an
accident
rather
a
romantic
accident
i
was
coming
home
one
sunday
evening
a
year
ago
i
had
been
to
church
in
my
best
clothes
and
when
i
was
halfway
here
the
skies
opened
and
the
rain
such
rain
a
deluge
dancing
up
from
the
pavement
streaming
along
the
gutters
i
had
an
umbrella
of
course
just
my
luck
and
i
had
my
hat
done
up
that
very
week
i
tore
it
off
and
wrapped
it
in
the
tails
of
my
coat
and
just
as
that
critical
moment
frank
passed
saw
me
doing
it
and
stopped
then
he
asked
if
i
would
allow
him
to
shelter
me
home
beneath
his
umbrella
well
i
the
girl
to
allow
men
to
speak
to
me
in
the
street
but
at
that
moment
in
that
deluge
when
he
just
seen
me
take
off
my
hat
a
gentleman
do
less
than
offer
to
shelter
me
would
it
have
been
sane
to
refuse
no
i
do
think
it
would
i
should
certainly
have
said
yes
too
that
the
sort
of
thing
that
would
have
been
called
chivalry
in
olden
times
it
chivalry
he
was
quite
right
to
offer
it
would
have
been
horrible
if
he
had
passed
by
and
left
you
to
be
drenched
cecil
brightened
with
relief
that
what
thought
so
i
said
and
of
course
while
we
walked
we
talked
and
the
wind
blew
my
hair
into
loose
ends
and
the
damp
made
them
curl
and
the
excitement
gave
me
a
colour
and
it
was
so
nice
to
talk
to
a
man
again
claire
after
everlasting
women
i
look
pretty
when
i
saw
myself
in
the
glass
when
i
came
in
almost
as
i
used
to
look
years
before
and
he
looked
handsome
too
big
and
strong
and
so
delightfully
like
a
man
and
unlike
a
member
of
staff
we
liked
each
other
very
much
and
when
we
got
to
this
door
silence
mary
rhodes
waited
wistfully
for
a
helping
word
claire
stared
into
the
fire
her
brows
knitted
in
suspense
well
naturally
we
were
sorry
to
part
he
asked
if
i
usually
went
to
saint
c
for
the
evening
service
i
did
but
i
said
i
knew
he
meant
to
meet
me
again
and
i
to
be
met
claire
sent
her
thoughts
back
and
recalled
a
certain
sunday
evening
when
she
had
offered
to
accompany
cecil
to
church
and
had
been
bluntly
informed
that
her
company
was
not
desired
she
had
taken
the
hint
and
had
not
offered
it
again
she
was
silent
waiting
for
the
revelations
which
were
still
to
come
so
after
that
it
became
a
regular
thing
he
met
me
outside
the
church
door
and
saw
me
home
he
often
asked
me
to
go
out
with
him
during
the
week
but
i
always
refused
until
suddenly
this
term
i
was
so
tired
so
hungry
for
a
change
that
i
gave
in
and
promised
that
i
would
i
suppose
that
shocks
you
into
fits
it
does
rather
you
see
explained
claire
laboriously
i
been
brought
up
on
the
continent
where
such
a
thing
would
be
impossible
it
would
be
an
insult
to
suggest
it
even
here
in
england
it
does
seem
right
do
you
think
a
really
nice
man
who
was
attracted
by
a
girl
would
find
some
other
way
get
an
introduction
how
it
easy
to
talk
but
is
he
to
do
it
we
live
in
different
worlds
i
am
a
high
school
teacher
living
in
rooms
in
london
without
a
relation
or
a
house
open
to
me
where
i
am
intimate
enough
to
take
a
friend
he
is
an
officer
in
a
crack
regiment
visiting
at
fashionable
houses
ca
you
imagine
how
his
hostesses
would
stare
if
he
asked
them
to
call
upon
me
here
in
this
poky
room
and
if
he
loves
me
if
i
interest
him
more
than
the
butterflies
of
society
if
he
wants
to
know
me
better
what
is
he
to
do
tell
me
that
my
dear
before
you
blame
me
for
taking
a
little
bit
of
fun
when
i
get
the
chance
but
claire
had
no
suggestion
to
make
she
herself
had
been
strong
enough
to
refuse
a
friendship
on
similar
lines
but
she
had
been
living
a
working
life
for
a
bare
four
months
while
cecil
had
been
teaching
for
twelve
years
twelve
years
of
a
life
living
in
other
women
houses
teaching
other
women
children
obeying
other
rules
with
the
one
keen
personal
experience
of
a
slighted
love
the
tale
of
close
on
four
thousand
nights
represented
a
dreary
parlour
and
a
pile
of
exercise
books
for
twelve
long
years
this
woman
had
worked
away
losing
her
youth
losing
her
bloom
cut
off
from
all
that
nature
intended
her
to
enjoy
and
then
at
the
end
behold
a
change
in
the
monotony
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
man
who
sought
her
admired
her
craved
her
society
as
a
boon
the
tears
came
to
claire
eyes
as
she
put
herself
in
such
a
place
and
realised
all
that
this
happening
would
mean
renewal
of
youth
renewal
of
hope
renewal
of
interest
and
zest
i
do
know
i
do
know
she
said
brokenly
it
all
wrong
somehow
you
ought
not
to
be
forced
into
such
a
position
but
i
blame
you
cecil
it
the
women
who
deserve
the
blame
the
women
who
are
better
off
and
could
have
opened
their
houses
you
have
been
so
drearily
dull
all
these
long
years
that
you
would
have
been
more
than
human
to
refuse
but
now
dear
now
that
you
are
engaged
surely
he
has
some
friends
to
whom
he
could
introduce
you
mary
rhodes
shook
her
head
not
till
his
people
know
it
might
come
round
to
their
ears
and
that
would
make
things
more
difficult
still
but
i
am
hoping
it
wo
be
long
now
claire
i
told
because
you
are
such
a
kind
understanding
little
soul
and
it
a
comfort
to
talk
things
out
but
i
kill
you
if
you
dare
to
breathe
a
word
to
another
soul
sophie
blake
or
mrs
willoughby
or
even
your
mother
when
you
write
to
her
you
can
never
tell
how
these
things
are
repeated
and
frank
would
never
forgive
me
if
it
came
out
through
me
promise
faithfully
that
never
mention
his
name
in
connection
with
me
of
course
i
will
what
do
you
take
me
for
i
should
dream
of
doing
such
a
thing
of
course
at
the
willoughbys
for
instance
if
anyone
mention
his
name
they
might
quite
well
for
i
should
think
they
were
in
much
the
same
set
there
would
be
no
harm
in
saying
that
you
heard
of
him
i
should
rather
like
to
hear
what
they
said
cecil
face
looked
wistful
as
she
spoke
these
last
words
but
the
next
moment
her
expression
changed
to
one
of
pure
amazement
as
the
whirr
of
the
cuckoo
clock
made
itself
heard
and
the
little
brown
bird
hopped
out
of
its
niche
and
sounded
five
clear
notes
gracious
what
that
where
did
that
come
from
it
was
a
christmas
present
to
me
from
abroad
claire
added
the
last
words
in
the
fond
hope
that
they
would
save
further
criticism
and
cecil
rose
from
her
seat
and
stood
in
front
of
the
hanging
clock
examining
it
with
critical
eyes
it
a
good
one
most
of
them
are
so
gimcrack
from
abroad
one
of
your
belgian
friends
i
suppose
does
it
make
that
awful
row
every
hour
i
ca
stand
it
here
you
know
if
it
does
do
trouble
yourself
i
take
it
upstairs
i
the
row
i
put
it
here
because
i
thought
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
you
as
well
as
to
myself
i
sorry
what
a
tantrum
evidently
the
clock
is
a
tender
point
better
leave
it
here
and
stop
the
gong
it
will
keep
you
awake
all
night
i
wo
stop
the
gong
i
i
like
to
be
waked
declared
claire
obstinately
she
lifted
the
clock
from
its
nail
and
stalked
out
of
the
room
head
in
air
cecil
whistled
softly
between
pursed
lips
chapter
twelve
an
unpleasant
in
the
inevitable
fatigue
which
had
marked
claire
first
experience
of
regular
work
she
had
looked
forward
with
joy
to
the
coming
of
the
holidays
when
she
would
be
able
to
take
her
ease
and
for
a
month
on
end
laze
through
the
hours
at
her
own
sweet
will
a
teacher
scores
above
other
workers
in
the
length
of
holidays
she
enjoys
several
months
in
the
year
contrasts
strongly
with
the
fortnight
or
three
weeks
enjoyed
by
a
female
clerk
or
typist
in
no
other
profession
is
so
large
a
proportion
of
the
year
given
to
rest
claire
had
condemned
the
staff
at
saint
cuthbert
for
want
of
appreciation
of
this
privilege
but
before
the
four
weeks
of
the
christmas
holidays
were
over
her
eyes
were
opened
to
the
other
side
of
the
picture
holidays
were
horribly
expensive
living
at
home
meant
an
added
bill
for
fire
and
light
to
add
to
the
necessary
expenses
abroad
that
the
last
items
were
necessary
could
hardly
be
denied
for
a
girl
who
had
been
shut
up
in
a
schoolroom
through
three
months
of
term
naturally
wished
to
amuse
herself
abroad
during
holiday
time
and
in
london
even
the
most
carefully
planned
amusement
has
a
habit
of
costing
money
even
that
mild
dissipation
of
enjoyed
by
sophie
blake
plus
the
additional
excitement
of
choosing
an
imaginary
present
from
every
window
could
only
be
enjoyed
at
the
price
of
two
tube
or
omnibus
fares
boots
wore
out
too
and
gloves
grew
shabby
and
the
january
sales
furnished
a
very
fire
of
temptation
claire
had
never
before
seen
such
bargains
as
confronted
her
down
the
length
of
oxford
and
regent
streets
and
though
she
might
be
firm
as
adamant
on
monday
or
tuesday
wednesday
was
bound
to
bring
about
a
weak
moment
which
carried
her
over
the
threshold
of
a
shop
and
once
inside
with
sensational
sacrifices
dangling
within
reach
resistance
melted
like
wax
where
do
you
suppose
you
are
going
to
wear
that
concoction
mary
rhodes
asked
blightingly
as
claire
opened
a
cardboard
box
which
had
arrived
by
the
morning
delivery
and
displayed
a
blue
muslin
dress
inset
with
lace
lords
i
suppose
or
ascot
or
ranelagh
or
hurlingham
or
henley
they
come
on
in
june
and
july
just
as
poor
high
mistresses
are
in
the
thick
of
cramming
for
the
matric
but
doubt
you
are
the
exception
to
the
rule
you
must
think
you
are
at
least
to
have
bought
a
frock
like
that
cecil
it
was
wickedly
cheap
it
was
indeed
it
was
one
of
a
few
summer
dresses
which
were
positively
given
away
and
it
made
in
the
simple
picturesque
style
which
i
love
and
which
does
not
go
out
of
date
i
had
the
least
intention
of
buying
anything
until
i
saw
it
hanging
there
at
that
price
and
it
looked
at
me
so
longingly
as
if
it
to
come
it
well
to
be
rich
it
might
have
longed
at
me
as
much
as
it
liked
i
could
have
bought
it
if
it
had
been
i
need
all
my
money
for
necessities
mary
rhodes
said
sighing
and
claire
felt
a
pang
of
reproach
for
since
her
return
cecil
had
indeed
seemed
painfully
short
of
loose
cash
the
debt
still
outstanding
had
been
increased
by
various
small
borrowings
insignificant
in
themselves
yet
important
as
showing
how
the
wind
blew
claire
wondered
if
perchance
the
poor
soul
had
crippled
herself
by
presenting
her
lover
with
a
christmas
gift
which
was
beyond
her
means
the
third
week
of
the
holidays
arrived
in
another
week
school
would
begin
claire
succumbed
to
temptation
once
more
purchased
two
good
tickets
for
an
afternoon
concert
at
the
queen
hall
and
invited
cecil
to
be
her
guest
cecil
hesitated
evidently
torn
between
two
attractions
asked
permission
to
defer
her
answer
until
the
next
day
but
finally
decided
to
accept
from
remarks
dropped
from
time
to
time
claire
had
gathered
that
major
carew
was
not
fond
of
indoor
entertainments
and
somewhat
disappointed
his
by
his
unwillingness
to
indulge
her
wishes
in
that
respect
in
this
instance
she
had
evidently
balanced
the
concert
against
an
afternoon
in
the
major
society
and
the
concert
had
won
claire
found
herself
cordially
in
agreement
when
the
afternoon
arrived
the
two
girls
arrayed
themselves
in
their
best
clothes
and
set
off
in
high
spirits
for
their
amusement
their
seats
were
in
a
good
position
and
the
concert
was
one
of
the
best
of
the
season
all
went
as
happily
as
it
could
possibly
go
until
the
last
strains
of
god
save
the
king
had
been
played
and
the
audience
filed
out
of
the
hall
on
to
the
crowded
pavement
and
then
with
a
throb
of
disgust
claire
recognised
the
figure
of
a
man
who
was
standing
directly
beneath
a
his
black
eyes
curiously
scanning
the
passing
stream
major
carew
he
had
evidently
been
told
of
the
girls
destination
and
had
come
with
the
express
purpose
of
meeting
them
coming
out
for
the
moment
however
they
were
unrecognised
and
claire
gave
a
quick
swerve
to
the
right
hurrying
out
of
the
patch
of
light
into
the
dimness
beyond
the
street
was
so
full
that
given
a
minute
start
it
would
surely
be
easy
to
escape
she
slid
her
hand
through
cecil
arm
drawing
her
forward
come
along
come
along
let
hurry
to
fuller
before
all
the
tables
are
taken
fuller
tea
how
scrumptious
just
what
i
longed
for
listening
to
classical
music
thirsty
work
cecil
replied
laughing
she
was
so
lively
so
natural
and
unconcerted
that
claire
absolved
her
on
the
moment
from
any
arrangement
as
to
a
in
her
anxiety
to
secure
the
cup
of
tea
she
broke
into
a
but
it
was
too
late
the
sharp
black
eyes
had
spied
them
out
the
tall
figure
loomed
by
their
side
the
large
face
with
its
florid
colouring
smiled
a
broad
smile
of
welcome
hulloa
mary
thought
it
was
you
i
was
just
passing
along
good
afternoon
miss
gifford
it
miss
gifford
is
it
had
a
good
concert
i
hope
a
pleasant
afternoon
very
good
thank
you
said
claire
shortly
mary
cried
oh
frank
how
did
you
come
i
did
expect
and
the
tone
of
her
voice
showed
that
the
surprise
was
hardly
more
agreeable
to
her
than
to
her
companion
however
welcome
her
lover
might
be
on
other
occasions
it
was
obvious
that
she
had
not
wished
to
see
him
at
this
particular
moment
well
well
we
must
move
on
we
must
block
up
the
pavement
the
major
said
hastily
he
took
his
place
by
the
kerb
which
placed
him
next
to
claire
and
bent
over
with
an
assiduous
air
you
must
let
me
escort
you
where
were
you
bound
for
next
claire
hesitated
she
wished
with
all
her
heart
that
she
had
not
mentioned
fuller
so
that
she
could
reply
that
they
were
bound
for
the
tube
oxford
circus
was
only
a
step
away
in
five
minutes
they
could
have
been
seated
in
the
train
but
cecil
had
declared
that
she
was
longing
for
tea
so
it
would
be
ungracious
to
withdraw
the
invitation
we
were
going
to
fuller
right
the
major
tone
was
complacent
good
idea
how
shall
we
go
taxi
tube
which
do
you
prefer
claire
stared
at
him
in
surprise
but
it
here
quite
close
we
nearly
there
he
looked
disconcerted
unnecessarily
disconcerted
claire
thought
for
it
was
surely
no
disgrace
for
a
man
to
be
ignorant
of
the
locality
of
a
confectioner
shop
from
the
other
side
came
cecil
voice
cool
and
constrained
if
you
were
going
anywhere
frank
you
need
stay
with
us
we
can
look
after
each
other
we
are
accustomed
to
going
about
alone
please
allow
me
the
pleasure
there
plenty
of
time
i
should
enjoy
some
tea
immensely
always
take
it
when
i
get
the
chance
the
block
on
the
pavement
made
consecutive
conversation
impossible
and
the
three
edged
their
way
in
and
out
in
silence
until
fuller
was
reached
and
one
of
the
last
tables
secured
the
room
looked
very
bright
and
dainty
the
christmas
garlands
still
festooning
the
walls
and
framing
the
mirrors
the
hanging
lights
covered
by
shades
the
soft
pink
light
was
very
kind
to
the
complexions
of
the
visitors
nevertheless
claire
felt
a
guilty
pang
as
she
looked
into
the
nearest
mirror
and
beheld
the
reflection
of
herself
and
her
friend
as
they
sat
side
by
side
as
a
rule
it
was
pure
pleasure
to
realise
her
own
fair
looks
but
for
the
moment
they
were
of
no
importance
whereas
poor
dear
cecil
had
a
lover
to
please
and
there
was
no
denying
cecil
was
not
looking
her
best
her
expression
was
frowning
and
dissatisfied
she
had
taken
off
her
veil
in
the
hall
and
her
hair
was
disarranged
compared
with
the
fashionable
groups
round
the
other
tables
she
looked
suddenly
shabby
and
insignificant
her
little
attempts
at
decoration
pitifully
betraying
the
amateur
hand
oh
dear
me
why
she
smile
she
looks
quite
pretty
when
she
smiles
i
hold
her
before
a
mirror
some
day
and
show
her
the
difference
it
makes
ten
years
disappear
in
a
flash
now
what
in
the
world
had
i
better
be
agreeable
and
chatty
or
cold
and
i
do
anything
to
please
her
but
it
hard
lines
having
our
afternoon
spoiled
and
being
sulked
at
into
the
bargain
cakes
please
lots
of
sweet
sugary
cakes
wo
that
do
cecil
we
can
have
at
home
cecil
cecil
her
name
is
mary
why
do
you
call
her
cecil
cried
the
major
quickly
looking
from
one
girl
to
another
claire
fancied
there
was
a
touch
of
suspicion
in
his
voice
and
wondered
that
he
should
show
so
much
interest
in
a
mere
nickname
because
she
is
of
course
for
a
moment
his
stare
showed
no
understanding
then
oh
that
fellow
he
said
slowly
i
see
it
a
pretty
name
anyway
beats
mary
to
fits
mary
is
so
dull
and
prosaic
too
many
of
them
about
one
gets
sick
of
the
sound
is
that
intended
for
me
by
any
chance
asked
cecil
in
her
most
acid
tones
whereupon
the
major
cried
oh
put
my
foot
in
it
that
time
did
i
and
burst
into
a
long
guffaw
of
laughter
which
brought
on
him
the
eyes
of
the
surrounders
claire
interest
had
already
been
aroused
by
a
little
party
of
two
men
and
two
women
who
were
sitting
at
a
table
in
the
corner
of
the
room
and
who
were
to
her
thinking
by
far
the
most
attractive
personalities
present
the
men
were
tall
well
set
up
not
especially
handsome
in
any
way
but
possessing
an
unmistakable
look
of
breeding
one
of
the
women
was
old
the
other
young
and
it
would
have
been
hard
to
say
which
was
the
more
attractive
of
the
two
they
were
quietly
but
very
elegantly
dressed
handsome
furs
being
thrown
back
to
show
pretty
bodices
of
ninon
and
lace
when
major
carew
gave
that
loud
unrestrained
laugh
the
four
members
of
this
attractive
party
turned
to
see
whence
the
sound
arose
but
whereas
three
faces
remained
blankly
indifferent
the
fourth
was
in
the
moment
transformed
into
an
expression
of
the
liveliest
surprise
he
stared
narrowing
his
eyes
as
if
doubting
that
they
were
really
seeing
aright
twisted
his
head
to
get
a
fuller
view
and
obtaining
it
twisted
back
into
his
original
position
his
lips
twitching
with
laughter
then
he
spoke
a
few
words
his
companions
leant
forward
to
listen
and
to
two
faces
out
of
the
three
the
laughter
spread
on
hearing
what
he
had
to
say
only
the
elder
of
the
two
ladies
retained
her
gravity
her
sweet
glance
rested
on
claire
face
and
her
brow
contracted
in
distress
in
the
major
and
cecil
she
showed
no
interest
but
claire
appearance
evidently
aroused
curiosity
and
pity
what
is
doing
in
that
the
question
was
written
on
every
line
of
the
sweet
bred
face
and
claire
read
its
significance
and
flinched
with
distaste
how
they
stare
cried
mary
rhodes
the
man
looked
as
if
he
knew
you
frank
do
you
know
who
he
is
he
a
member
of
the
club
his
name
is
vavasour
we
know
each
other
by
sight
major
carew
florid
colour
had
grown
a
shade
deeper
he
was
evidently
disconcerted
by
the
encounter
but
he
made
a
strong
effort
to
regain
his
composure
smiled
at
the
two
girls
in
turn
and
cried
lightly
envies
me
i
suppose
seeing
me
with
two
such
charmers
he
did
look
exactly
envious
cecil
said
drily
she
also
had
noticed
that
reflection
in
the
mirror
and
it
had
not
helped
to
soothe
her
spirits
she
felt
an
unreasoning
anger
against
claire
for
appearing
more
attractive
than
herself
but
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
she
was
heightening
the
contrast
by
her
own
dour
ungracious
manner
altogether
that
was
a
difficult
occasion
and
as
it
proceeded
spirits
sank
ever
lower
and
lower
she
had
spent
more
than
she
had
any
right
to
afford
on
those
two
expensive
tickets
hoping
thereby
to
give
pleasure
and
now
cecil
was
in
a
bad
temper
and
would
snap
for
days
to
it
was
not
a
cheerful
outlook
and
for
the
second
time
a
feeling
of
restiveness
overtook
her
a
longing
for
a
companion
who
would
help
the
gaiety
of
life
such
a
companion
as
pretty
lively
sophie
blake
for
example
how
refreshing
it
would
be
to
live
with
sophie
just
for
a
moment
claire
dwelt
wistfully
on
the
possibility
then
banished
it
with
a
loyal
she
does
need
me
and
cecil
does
she
fond
of
me
in
her
funny
way
she
must
be
for
she
has
confided
in
me
already
more
than
in
any
of
the
others
whom
she
known
for
years
and
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
help
the
major
passed
his
cup
for
a
second
supply
a
waitress
brought
a
plate
of
hot
cakes
the
occupants
of
the
corner
table
stood
up
fastening
furs
and
coats
and
passed
out
of
the
door
with
their
going
major
carew
regained
his
vivacity
chaffed
the
girls
on
their
silence
recounted
the
latest
funny
stories
and
to
claire
relief
addressed
himself
primarily
to
his
thus
putting
her
in
the
place
of
honour
nevertheless
claire
was
conscious
that
from
time
to
time
keen
glances
were
cast
in
her
own
direction
she
had
a
feeling
that
no
detail
of
her
attire
escaped
scrutiny
that
the
black
eyes
noted
one
and
all
wondered
and
speculated
and
appraised
she
saw
them
dwell
on
the
handsome
fur
stole
and
muff
which
mrs
judge
bequeathed
to
her
daughter
on
sailing
for
india
on
the
old
diamond
ring
and
brooch
which
had
been
handed
over
to
her
on
her
birthday
she
had
an
instinctive
feeling
that
she
rose
in
the
man
estimation
because
of
her
air
of
prosperity
he
made
tentative
efforts
to
arrange
a
further
meeting
where
do
go
on
sundays
miss
gifford
i
say
we
must
arrange
another
tea
like
this
lots
of
good
tea
places
in
town
we
must
sample
them
together
what
do
you
say
miss
gifford
claire
answers
were
politely
evasive
and
presently
he
began
to
grow
restless
and
finally
pulled
out
his
watch
and
jumped
to
his
feet
how
time
flies
i
had
no
idea
it
was
so
late
i
must
run
so
sorry
to
leave
you
like
this
mary
rhodes
stared
in
surprise
leave
frank
but
you
said
i
thought
we
were
going
yes
i
know
i
know
i
sorry
i
thought
i
was
free
but
a
regimental
engagement
ca
get
out
of
it
i
fix
up
another
night
i
write
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
was
genuinely
disconcerted
at
the
lateness
of
the
hour
and
his
was
of
the
most
hasty
description
though
he
found
time
to
give
a
lingering
pressure
to
claire
hand
then
he
was
gone
and
the
waitress
came
across
the
room
and
presented
the
bill
cecil
flushed
uncomfortably
i
must
pay
this
frank
has
forgotten
he
rushed
off
in
such
a
hurry
she
pulled
out
her
shabby
purse
and
claire
made
no
protest
in
a
similar
position
she
herself
would
have
wished
to
pay
but
it
was
inconceivable
that
she
should
ever
be
in
such
a
position
however
hurried
a
man
might
be
she
rubbed
her
hand
on
her
knee
with
a
little
shudder
of
distaste
wretch
he
would
make
love
to
me
too
if
i
would
allow
it
how
can
cecil
possibly
care
for
such
a
man
and
then
she
forgot
cecil
feelings
to
ponder
on
a
more
perplexing
problem
why
had
the
man
called
vavasour
looked
so
amused
and
why
had
the
faced
woman
looked
so
distressed

you
soon

was
the
day
on

school

janet
holiday
was

long
not
a
short
four
weeks
cecil
moaned
loudly
but
claire
was
tired
of
aimless
days
and
welcomed
the
return
to
work
she
determined
to
throw
her
whole
heart
into
her
task
and
work
as
no
junior
french
mistress
had
ever
worked
before
she
determined
never
to
lose
patience
never
to
grow
cross
never
to
indulge
in
a
sarcastic
word
always
to
be
a
model
of
tact
and
forbearance
she
determined
to
wield
such
an
ennobling
influence
over
the
girls
in
her
that
they
should
take
fire
from
her
example
and
go
forth
into
the
world
perfect
women
who
should
leaven
the
race
she
determined
also
to
be
the
life
and
soul
of
the
the
general
confidante
and
consoler
beloved
by
one
and
all
she
determined
to
seize
tactfully
upon
every
occasion
of
serving
the
head
and
acting
as
a
buffer
between
her
and
disagreeables
of
every
kind
she
arranged
a
touching
scene
wherein
miss
farnborough
retiring
from
work
and
being
asked
by
the
committee
to
name
a
worthy
successor
pronounced
unhesitatingly
claire
gifford
she
is
but
young
but
her
wisdom
and
diplomacy
are
beyond
all
praise
she
saw
herself
head
of
saint
cuthbert
raised
to
the
highest
step
of
her
scholastic
ladder
but
somehow
the
climax
was
not
so
exhilarating
as
the
climb
itself
to
be
head
mistress
was
no
doubt
a
fine
achievement
but
it
left
her
cold
inside
saint
cuthbert
all
was
life
and
bustle
girls
streaming
along
the
corridors
in
and
out
of
every
room
girls
of
all
ages
and
sizes
and
shapes
but
all
bearing
an
appearance
of
happiness
and
animation
blouses
shone
forth
in
their
first
splendour
ribbons
stood
out
stiff
and
straight
many
of
the
girls
carried
bunches
of
flowers
to
present
to
the
special
mistress
for
whom
they
cherished
the
fashionable
grand
passion
so
characteristic
of
school
life
flora
had
a
bunch
of
early
daffodils
for
claire
another
girl
presented
a
pot
of
roman
hyacinths
for
the
decoration
of
the
a
third
a
tiny
bottle
of
scent
three
separate
donors
supplied
buttonholes
of
violets
the
atmosphere
was
full
of
kindness
and
affection
girls
encountering
each
other
would
fall
into
each
other
arms
with
exclamations
of
ecstatic
affection
oh
you
precious
lamb
my
angel
child
you
dear
old
darling
duck
claire
heard
a
squat
ugly
girl
with
spectacles
and
a
nose
addressed
as
a
princely
pet
by
an
ardent
adorer
of
fourteen
the
mistresses
came
in
for
their
own
share
of
adulation
darling
miss
gifford
i
adore
you
miss
gifford
darling
you
are
prettier
than
ever
oh
miss
i
was
to
see
you
the
morning
flew
past
and
brought
the
gathering
of
mistresses
in
mademoiselle
greetings
were
politely
detached
fraulein
was
kindly
and
discursive
sophie
smile
was
as
bright
as
ever
but
she
did
not
look
well
oh
i
all
right
it
nothing
only
this
horrid
old
pain
she
said
cheerfully
into
her
glass
of
water
she
dropped
three
tabloids
of
aspirin
every
one
had
been
away
for
a
longer
or
shorter
time
visiting
relatives
and
friends
they
compared
experiences
some
had
enjoyed
themselves
some
had
not
but
they
all
agreed
that
they
were
refreshed
by
the
change
and
where
have
been
asked
the
drawing
mistress
of
claire
and
exclaimed
in
surprise
at
hearing
that
she
had
remained
in
town
dear
me
i
wish
i
had
known
i
been
back
a
fortnight
we
might
have
done
something
together
were
you
asked
the
drawing
mistress
staring
with
curious
eyes
very
answered
poor
claire
and
for
a
moment
struggled
with
a
horrible
inclination
to
cry
after
lunch
miss
bates
took
her
cup
of
coffee
to
claire
side
and
made
an
obvious
attempt
to
be
pleasant
i
feel
quite
remorseful
to
think
of
your
holidays
it
astonishing
how
little
we
mistresses
know
of
each
other
out
of
school
hours
the
first
school
i
was
in
a
much
smaller
one
by
the
sea
we
were
so
friendly
and
jolly
just
like
sisters
but
in
the
big
towns
every
one
seems
detached
it
hard
on
the
i
do
know
i
should
have
done
if
i
had
a
brother
house
to
go
to
on
sundays
and
holiday
afternoons
except
through
him
i
have
made
a
single
friend
at
the
other
place
people
used
to
ask
us
out
and
we
had
quite
a
good
time
but
in
town
people
are
engrossed
in
their
own
affairs
they
have
time
to
go
outside
i
wonder
you
ever
left
that
school
what
made
you
want
to
change
oh
well
london
was
a
lure
most
people
want
to
come
to
london
and
i
had
my
brother
do
tell
me
another
time
if
you
are
not
going
away
it
worries
me
to
think
of
you
being
alone
how
did
you
come
to
get
this
post
if
you
have
no
connections
in
town
miss
farnborough
came
to
stay
in
brussels
in
the
which
my
mother
and
i
had
made
headquarters
for
some
time
she
offered
me
the
post
miss
bates
stared
with
distended
eyes
how
long
had
she
known
you
about
a
fortnight
i
think
i
do
remember
exactly
and
you
had
never
seen
her
before
she
knew
nothing
about
you
she
had
never
seen
me
before
but
she
know
something
about
me
professionally
speaking
she
knew
all
there
was
to
know
that
accounts
for
it
said
miss
bates
enigmatically
i
wondered
you
are
not
a
bit
the
usual
type
i
hope
that
does
mean
that
i
ca
teach
miss
bates
laughed
and
shrugged
her
thin
shoulders
oh
no
i
should
say
personally
that
you
teach
very
well
that
play
was
extraordinarily
good
it
absolutely
sounded
like
french
ca
think
how
you
knocked
the
accent
into
them
english
girls
are
so
conscious
they
are
ashamed
of
letting
themselves
go
mademoiselle
thinks
that
your
classes
are
too
like
play
but
it
does
matter
what
she
thinks
so
long
as
she
paused
a
moment
lowered
her
voice
and
added
impressively
keep
on
the
right
side
of
miss
farnborough
you
are
all
right
so
long
as
you
are
in
her
good
books
better
be
careful
what
do
you
mean
claire
stared
puzzled
and
discomposed
decidedly
on
the
offensive
but
miss
bates
refused
a
definite
answer
nothing
she
said
tersely
only
people
who
take
sudden
fancies
can
take
sudden
dislikes
too
ask
no
more
questions
but
do
say
i
did
warn
you
that
all
she
lifted
her
and
strolled
away
leaving
claire
to
reflect
impatiently
poison
it
too
bad
they
wo
one
be
happy
before
the
end
of
the
week
school
work
settled
into
its
old
routine
and
the
days
passed
by
with
little
to
mark
their
progress
the
english
climate
was
at
its
worst
and
three
times
out
of
four
the
journey
to
school
was
accomplished
in
rain
or
sleet
the
were
crammed
with
passengers
and
manifested
an
unpleasant
tendency
to
skid
faced
crowded
the
carriages
of
the
tube
for
days
together
the
sky
remained
a
leaden
grey
it
takes
a
mark
tapley
himself
to
keep
smiling
under
such
conditions
as
claire
recalled
the
days
when
she
and
her
mother
had
sat
luxuriously
under
the
trees
in
the
gardens
of
riviera
hotels
listening
to
exhilarating
bands
and
admiring
the
outline
of
the
esterels
against
the
cloudless
blue
of
the
sky
the
drab
london
streets
assumed
a
dreariness
which
was
almost
insupportable
also
though
she
would
not
acknowledge
it
to
herself
she
was
achingly
disappointed
because
something
which
she
had
been
expecting
did
not
come
to
pass
she
had
expected
something
to
happen
but
nothing
happened
all
through
february
the
weeks
dragged
on
unrelieved
by
any
episode
except
the
weekly
mail
from
india
the
little
brown
bird
still
industriously
piped
the
hour
but
his
appearance
no
longer
brought
the
same
warm
thrill
of
happiness
and
then
one
morning
came
a
note
from
janet
willoughby
dear
miss
gifford
i
should
really
like
to
call
you
but
i
must
wait
to
be
asked
i
have
been
meaning
to
write
ever
since
we
returned
from
saint
moritz
but
you
know
how
it
is
in
town
such
a
continual
rush
that
one
can
never
get
through
half
the
things
that
ought
to
be
done
we
should
all
like
to
see
you
again
mother
has
another
home
on
thursday
evening
next
and
would
be
glad
to
see
you
then
if
you
cared
to
come
but
what
should
like
is
to
have
you
to
myself
on
saturday
next
i
could
call
for
you
as
i
did
at
christmas
and
keep
you
for
the
whole
day
then
we
could
talk
as
we
could
do
at
the
homes
which
are
really
rather
dull
duty
occasions
let
me
know
which
of
these
propositions
suits
you
best
looking
forward
to
seeing
you
your
friend
if
you
will
have
me
janet
willoughby
claire
had
opened
the
letter
aglow
with
expectation
she
laid
it
down
feeling
dazed
and
blank
for
the
moment
only
one
fact
stood
out
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
and
that
was
that
janet
did
not
wish
her
to
be
present
at
the
at
home
mrs
willoughby
had
sent
the
invitation
but
janet
had
supplemented
it
by
another
which
could
not
be
refused
i
would
rather
have
you
to
myself
how
was
it
possible
to
refuse
an
invitation
couched
in
such
terms
how
could
one
answer
with
any
show
of
civility
i
should
prefer
to
come
with
the
crowd
claire
carried
the
letter
up
to
her
cold
bedroom
and
sat
down
to
do
a
little
honest
thinking
it
very
difficult
to
understand
what
one
really
wants
we
deceive
ourselves
as
much
as
we
do
other
people
why
am
i
so
hideously
depressed
i
liked
going
to
the
home
i
liked
dressing
up
and
driving
through
the
streets
and
seeing
the
flowers
and
the
dresses
and
having
the
good
supper
but
if
that
were
all
i
believe
i
prefer
the
whole
day
with
janet
i
suppose
really
it
captain
fanshawe
at
the
bottom
of
it
i
want
to
meet
him
i
thought
i
should
meet
him
and
now
it
over
i
sha
be
asked
again
when
there
a
chance
of
his
coming
janet
does
want
me
she
not
jealous
of
course
absurd
but
she
wants
to
keep
him
to
herself
and
she
imagines
somehow
that
i
should
interfere
imagination
pictured
janet
staring
with
puzzled
uneasy
eyes
across
the
tables
in
the
of
janet
drearily
examining
the
presents
in
the
boudoir
and
then
like
a
flash
of
light
showed
the
picture
of
another
face
now
eager
animated
admiring
again
grave
and
wistful
is
your
address
still
the
grand
hotel
address
is
still
the
carlton
club
ah
well
well
acknowledged
claire
to
her
heart
we
like
each
other
we
did
love
being
together
and
he
remembered
me
he
sent
me
the
clock
when
he
was
away
but
it
all
over
now
that
was
our
last
chance
and
it
gone
he
go
to
the
at
home
and
mrs
willoughby
will
tell
him
i
was
asked
but
preferred
to
come
when
they
were
alone
and
he
think
it
was
because
i
wanted
to
avoid
him
and
and
oh
goodness
goodness
goodness
how
i
shall
feel
sitting
here
all
thursday
evening
imagining
all
that
is
going
on
oh
mother
mother
your
poor
little
girl
is
lonesome
why
did
you
go
so
far
away
claire
put
her
head
down
on
the
and
shed
a
few
tears
a
weakness
bitterly
regretted
for
like
all
weaknesses
the
consequences
wrought
fresh
trouble
now
her
eyelids
were
red
and
she
was
obliged
to
hang
shivering
out
of
the
window
until
they
had
regained
their
natural
colour
before
she
could
face
cecil
sharp
eyes
janet
arrived
soon
after
eleven
on
saturday
morning
and
was
shown
into
the
saffron
parlour
where
claire
sat
over
her
week
mending
she
wore
a
spring
suit
purchased
in
paris
and
a
hat
which
was
probably
smart
but
very
certainly
was
unbecoming
slanting
as
it
did
at
a
violent
angle
over
her
plump
face
and
almost
entirely
blinding
one
eye
she
caught
sight
of
her
own
reflection
in
the
overmantel
and
exclaimed
what
a
fright
i
look
as
she
seated
herself
by
the
table
and
threw
off
her
furs
do
hurry
please
let
me
stay
and
watch
what
are
you
doing
mending
a
blouse
how
clever
of
you
to
be
able
to
use
your
fingers
as
well
as
your
brains
i
never
sew
except
stupid
for
bazaars
so
this
is
your
room
you
told
me
about
the
walls
can
you
imagine
any
one
in
cold
blood
choosing
such
a
paper
but
it
looks
cosy
all
the
same
i
like
little
rooms
with
everything
carefully
in
reach
they
are
ever
so
much
nicer
than
big
ones
are
they
no
janet
pealed
with
laughter
that
right
snub
me
i
deserve
to
be
snubbed
of
course
i
meant
when
you
have
big
ones
as
well
who
is
the
pretty
girl
in
the
carved
frame
your
mother
do
you
mean
it
really
what
a
ridiculous
mamma
i
afraid
claire
i
afraid
she
is
even
prettier
than
you
oh
she
is
i
know
it
but
i
have
more
charm
returned
claire
demurely
whereat
they
laughed
again
a
peal
of
happy
girlish
laughter
which
reached
lizzie
ears
as
she
polished
the
oilcloth
in
the
hall
and
roused
an
envious
sigh
it
well
to
be
some
folks
thought
poor
lizzie
and
fine
dresses
and
nothing
to
do
of
a
saturday
morning
but
sit
still
and
laugh
i
could
laugh
myself
if
i
was
in
her
shoes
claire
folded
away
her
blouse
and
took
up
a
bundle
of
gloves
these
are
your
gloves
they
have
been
such
a
comfort
to
me
there
a
button
missing
somewhere
tell
me
all
about
your
holiday
did
you
have
a
good
time
was
it
as
nice
as
you
expected
yes
no
it
a
good
time
but
do
you
think
anything
ever
comes
up
to
one
expectation
i
had
looked
forward
to
that
month
for
the
whole
year
and
had
built
so
many
fairy
castles
you
have
stayed
in
switzerland
you
know
how
the
scene
changes
when
the
sun
sinks
how
those
beautiful
alluring
peaks
become
in
a
minute
awesome
and
gloomy
well
it
was
rather
like
that
with
me
i
do
mean
that
it
was
gloomy
that
exaggerating
but
it
was
prose
and
i
had
pictured
it
poetry
heigho
it
a
weary
world
claire
glance
was
not
entirely
sympathetic
there
are
different
kinds
of
prose
you
will
forgive
my
saying
that
your
especial
sort
is
an
de
i
know
i
know
you
ca
be
harder
on
me
than
i
am
on
myself
my
dear
i
have
a
most
sensible
head
i
about
as
practical
and
headed
as
any
woman
of
forty
it
my
silly
old
heart
which
handicaps
me
it
fall
into
line
have
you
finished
your
mending
may
i
come
upstairs
and
see
your
room
while
you
dress
for
just
the
fraction
of
a
moment
claire
hesitated
janet
saw
the
doubt
and
attributed
it
to
disinclination
to
exhibit
a
shabby
room
but
in
reality
claire
was
proud
of
her
attic
which
a
little
ingenuity
had
made
into
a
very
charming
abode
turkey
red
curtains
draped
the
window
a
low
was
covered
in
the
same
material
a
red
silk
eiderdown
covered
the
little
bed
on
the
white
walls
were
a
profusion
of
photographs
and
prints
framed
with
a
simple
binding
of
leather
around
the
glass
the
toilet
table
showed
an
array
of
silver
while
a
second
table
was
arranged
for
writing
and
held
a
number
of
pretty
accessories
a
wide
board
had
been
placed
over
the
narrow
mantel
on
which
stood
a
few
good
pieces
of
china
and
antique
silver
there
was
nothing
gimcrack
to
be
seen
no
ornaments
no
imitations
of
any
kind
despite
its
sloping
roof
and
its
whitewashed
walls
it
was
a
lady
room
and
janet
admiration
was
unfeigned
my
dear
it
a
lamb
i
love
your
touches
of
scarlet
dear
me
quite
a
view
i
shall
have
sloping
walls
when
i
change
my
room
they
are
so
picturesque
it
a
perfect
duck
and
everything
looks
so
bright
they
keep
it
well
keep
it
well
claire
corrected
lizzie
it
every
morning
but
it
not
a
doing
which
satisfies
me
so
i
put
in
a
little
manual
labour
every
afternoon
as
a
change
from
using
my
brain
i
do
all
the
polishing
you
ca
expect
servants
to
clean
silver
and
brass
ca
you
no
i
suppose
you
ca
janet
voice
of
a
sudden
sounded
flat
and
absent
there
was
a
moment
pause
then
she
added
tentatively
you
have
a
cuckoo
clock
claire
was
thankful
that
her
face
was
screened
from
view
as
she
was
in
the
process
of
tying
on
her
veil
a
muffled
yes
was
her
only
reply
janet
stood
in
front
of
the
clock
staring
at
it
with
curious
eyes
it
it
like
there
were
some
just
like
this
in
a
shop
at
saint
moritz
they
are
all
much
alike
do
you
think
i
suppose
they
are
yes
in
a
way
some
are
much
better
than
others
this
is
one
of
the
best
yes
it
is
it
keeps
beautiful
time
i
had
it
in
the
but
miss
rhodes
objected
to
the
noise
was
it
in
saint
moritz
that
you
bought
it
i
did
buy
it
it
was
a
present
that
finished
the
since
politeness
forbade
that
janet
should
go
a
step
further
and
ask
the
name
of
the
friend
which
was
what
she
was
obviously
longing
to
do
she
stood
a
moment
longer
staring
blankly
at
the
clock
then
gave
a
little
sigh
and
moved
on
to
examine
the
ornaments
on
the
mantelpiece
five
minutes
later
the
two
girls
descended
the
staircase
and
drove
away
from
the
door
the
next
few
hours
passed
pleasantly
enough
but
claire
wondered
if
it
were
her
own
imagination
which
made
her
think
that
janet
manner
was
not
quite
so
frank
and
bright
as
it
had
been
before
she
had
caught
sight
of
the
cuckoo
clock
she
never
again
said
claire
but
her
brown
eyes
studied
claire
face
with
a
wistful
scrutiny
and
from
time
to
time
a
sharp
little
sigh
punctuated
her
sentences
but
what
could
i
tell
her
claire
asked
unhappily
of
her
conscience
i
do
i
only
think
and
even
if
he
send
it
it
does
necessarily
affect
his
feelings
towards
her
he
was
going
to
see
her
in
a
few
days
and
she
is
rich
and
has
everything
she
wants
while
i
am
poor
and
alone
it
was
just
kindness
nothing
more
but
though
her
head
was
satisfied
with
such
reasoning
her
heart
like
janet
refused
to
fall
into
line
at
several
callers
arrived
foremost
among
them
a
tall
man
whom
claire
at
once
recognised
as
the
original
of
a
portrait
which
stood
opposite
to
that
of
captain
fanshawe
on
the
mantelpiece
of
boudoir
this
was
the
kind
man
the
thoughtful
man
the
man
who
remembered
little
things
and
in
truth
he
bore
the
mark
of
it
in
every
line
of
his
face
apart
from
his
expression
his
appearance
was
ordinary
enough
but
he
was
a
man
to
trust
and
claire
found
something
pathetic
in
the
wistful
admiration
which
shone
in
his
eyes
as
they
followed
janet
willoughby
about
the
room
to
ordinary
observers
she
was
just
a
pleasant
girl
with
no
pretensions
to
beauty
to
him
she
was
obviously
the
most
lovely
of
her
sex
he
had
no
attention
to
spare
for
claire
or
the
other
ladies
present
he
was
absorbed
in
watching
janet
waiting
for
opportunities
to
serve
janet
listening
eagerly
to
janet
words
it
is
not
often
that
an
unengaged
lover
is
so
transparent
in
his
devotion
but
malcolm
heward
was
supremely
indifferent
to
the
fact
that
he
betrayed
his
feelings
at
ten
claire
rose
to
take
leave
and
mrs
willoughby
made
a
request
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
do
me
a
favour
dear
a
friend
is
having
a
sale
of
work
at
her
house
for
a
charity
in
which
we
are
both
interested
and
she
has
asked
me
to
help
it
is
on
a
saturday
afternoon
and
evening
and
i
wondered
if
i
might
ask
you
to
take
part
in
the
little
concerts
whistling
is
always
popular
and
you
do
it
so
charmingly
i
would
send
the
car
for
you
and
take
you
home
of
course
and
be
so
very
much
indebted
you
do
mind
my
asking
no
indeed
i
should
be
delighted
please
let
me
help
you
whenever
you
can
in
the
bedroom
upstairs
janet
deliberately
introduced
malcolm
name
that
was
the
man
i
told
you
about
at
christmas
he
was
one
of
the
party
at
saint
moritz
what
did
you
think
of
him
i
liked
him
immensely
he
looks
all
that
you
said
he
was
he
has
a
fine
face
he
wants
to
marry
me
claire
laughed
softly
that
obvious
i
never
saw
a
man
give
himself
away
so
openly
do
you
think
i
ought
to
accept
him
oh
how
can
i
say
it
not
for
me
to
advise
i
hope
whoever
you
marry
you
be
very
very
happy
suddenly
janet
came
forward
and
laid
her
hands
on
claire
arm
oh
claire
i
do
like
you
i
do
want
to
be
friends
but
sometimes
i
have
the
strangest
thoughts
before
claire
had
time
to
answer
she
had
drawn
back
again
and
was
saying
with
a
little
apologetic
laugh
i
am
silly
take
no
notice
of
what
i
say
here
your
fur
here
your
muff
are
you
quite
sure
you
have
all
your
possessions
chapter
fourteen
a
question
of
money
the
next
week
was
memorable
to
claire
as
marking
the
beginning
of
serious
anxiety
with
regard
to
sophie
she
had
looked
ill
since
the
beginning
of
the
term
and
the
bottle
of
aspirin
tabloids
had
become
quite
an
accustomed
feature
on
the
luncheon
table
but
when
questioned
she
had
always
a
smile
and
an
easy
excuse
what
can
you
expect
in
this
weather
no
one
but
a
fish
could
help
aching
in
these
floods
i
perfectly
all
right
but
one
morning
this
week
meeting
her
on
an
upper
landing
claire
discovered
sophie
apparently
dragging
herself
along
with
her
hands
and
punctuating
each
step
with
a
gasp
of
pain
she
stood
still
and
stared
whereupon
sophie
instantly
straightened
herself
and
ascended
the
remaining
steps
in
a
normal
manner
sophie
cried
claire
sternly
do
pretend
i
heard
you
i
saw
you
my
dear
girl
is
the
rheumatism
so
bad
sophie
twisted
her
head
this
way
and
that
her
lips
pursed
in
warning
be
careful
you
never
know
who
is
about
i
rather
stiff
this
raw
fog
has
been
the
last
straw
i
shall
be
all
right
when
we
get
through
this
month
i
hate
march
it
finds
out
all
the
weak
spots
please
claire
do
take
any
notice
a
gym
mistress
has
no
business
to
have
rheumatism
it
really
very
good
for
me
to
be
obliged
to
keep
going
it
is
always
worse
at
the
beginning
of
the
day
claire
went
away
with
a
pain
in
her
heart
and
the
pain
grew
steadily
as
she
watched
sophie
throughout
the
week
the
pretty
face
was
often
drawn
with
pain
she
rose
and
sat
down
with
an
obvious
effort
and
still
the
rain
poured
and
the
dark
fog
enveloped
the
city
and
sophie
struggled
to
and
from
her
work
in
a
thin
blue
serge
suit
which
had
already
seen
three
winters
wear
one
day
the
subject
came
up
for
discussion
in
the
and
claire
was
shocked
and
surprised
at
the
attitude
of
the
other
teachers
they
were
sorry
for
sophie
they
sympathised
to
a
certain
extent
they
were
even
anxious
on
her
account
but
the
prevailing
sentiment
seemed
to
be
that
the
kindest
thing
was
to
take
no
notice
of
her
sufferings
no
use
pitying
her
that
would
only
make
her
more
sorry
for
herself
no
use
suggesting
cures
cures
take
time
not
to
speak
of
money
the
easter
holidays
would
soon
be
here
perhaps
she
might
try
something
then
in
the
meantime
she
must
get
along
as
best
she
could
there
was
simply
no
time
to
be
i
a
churchyard
cough
myself
declared
the
arts
mistress
i
stayed
in
bed
all
saturday
and
sunday
and
it
was
really
a
little
better
but
it
was
as
bad
as
ever
after
a
day
in
this
big
draughty
hole
and
i
am
racked
with
neuralgia
chimed
in
miss
bates
the
subject
of
sophie
was
lost
in
a
general
lamentation
friday
evening
came
and
after
the
girls
had
departed
claire
went
in
search
of
sophie
hoping
tactfully
to
be
able
to
suggest
remedial
methods
over
the
she
peeped
into
several
rooms
before
at
last
in
one
of
the
smallest
and
most
she
caught
sight
of
a
figure
crouched
with
buried
head
at
the
far
end
of
the
table
it
was
sophie
and
she
was
crying
and
catching
her
breath
in
a
weak
exhausted
fashion
pitiful
to
hear
claire
shut
the
door
tightly
and
put
her
arms
round
the
shaking
form
miss
blake
sophie
you
poor
dear
girl
you
are
tired
out
you
have
been
struggling
all
the
week
but
it
friday
night
dear
remember
that
you
can
go
home
and
just
tumble
into
bed
do
give
way
when
you
been
so
brave
but
for
the
moment
sophie
bravery
had
deserted
her
it
raining
it
raining
it
rains
i
ca
face
it
the
pain
all
over
me
and
the
omnibuses
stop
they
expect
you
to
jump
in
and
i
ca
jump
i
do
know
how
to
get
home
well
i
do
claire
cried
briskly
there
no
difficulty
about
that
i
sick
of
wet
walks
myself
i
whistle
for
a
taxi
and
we
drive
home
in
state
i
take
you
home
first
and
then
go
on
myself
or
if
you
like
i
come
in
with
you
and
help
you
to
bed
oh
yes
please
do
come
i
do
want
to
be
alone
faltered
sophie
weakly
but
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
in
characteristic
fashion
began
to
cheer
up
at
the
thought
of
the
drive
home
there
was
a
cheerful
fire
burning
in
sophie
and
the
table
was
laid
for
tea
in
quite
an
appetising
fashion
the
landlady
came
in
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
and
showed
a
sympathetic
interest
at
the
sight
of
sophie
face
i
you
you
were
fit
to
go
out
she
said
sagely
now
just
sit
yourself
down
before
the
fire
and
i
take
your
things
upstairs
and
bring
you
down
a
warm
shawl
then
you
shall
have
your
teas
bring
in
a
little
table
so
you
can
have
it
where
you
are
she
left
the
room
and
sophie
looked
after
her
with
grateful
eyes
that
what
i
pay
for
she
said
eloquently
she
so
kind
i
love
that
woman
for
all
her
niceness
to
me
i
told
you
i
had
no
right
to
pay
so
much
rent
i
came
in
just
for
a
few
weeks
until
i
could
find
something
else
and
i
have
had
the
to
i
been
in
such
holes
and
had
such
awful
landladies
they
seem
divided
into
two
big
classes
kind
and
dirty
or
clean
and
when
you
get
one
who
is
kind
clean
you
feel
so
grateful
that
you
pay
your
last
penny
rather
than
move
away
oh
how
lovely
how
lovely
how
lovely
friday
night
and
i
can
be
ill
comfortably
all
the
time
till
monday
morning
are
we
jolly
to
have
our
saturdays
to
ourselves
how
thankful
the
poor
clerks
and
typists
would
be
to
be
in
our
place
she
was
smiling
again
enjoying
the
warmth
of
the
fire
the
ease
of
the
cushioned
chair
when
mrs
rogers
entered
she
snoodled
into
the
folds
of
a
knitted
shawl
and
lay
back
placidly
while
the
kind
creature
took
off
her
wet
shoes
and
stockings
and
replaced
them
by
a
long
pair
of
fleecy
woollen
reaching
knee
high
the
landlady
knelt
to
her
task
and
sophie
laid
a
hand
on
the
top
of
starched
lace
and
magenta
velvet
and
cried
rise
lady
susan
rogers
one
of
the
truest
ladies
that
ever
breathed
how
you
do
talk
said
the
landlady
but
her
eyes
shone
as
she
expounded
to
her
husband
in
the
kitchen
miss
blake
had
such
a
way
with
her
when
ladies
were
like
that
you
did
care
what
you
did
but
there
was
them
as
treated
you
like
kaffirs
tea
was
quite
a
cheerful
and
sociable
little
meal
during
which
no
reference
was
made
to
sophie
ailments
but
when
the
cups
had
been
replaced
on
the
central
table
claire
seated
herself
and
said
with
an
air
of
decision
now
we
going
to
have
a
disagreeable
conversation
i
do
approve
of
the
way
you
have
been
going
on
this
last
month
and
it
time
it
came
to
an
end
you
are
ill
and
it
your
business
to
take
steps
to
get
better
oh
yes
and
you
are
going
to
take
them
too
what
am
i
going
to
do
you
are
going
to
see
a
specialist
next
week
you
surprise
me
sophie
smiled
with
exaggerated
lightness
what
funny
things
one
does
hear
why
should
you
see
a
specialist
i
defy
you
to
give
me
one
sensible
reason
i
do
better
than
that
i
give
you
two
so
do
then
what
are
they
guineas
said
sophie
for
a
moment
claire
stared
blankly
then
she
laughed
oh
i
see
yes
it
is
rather
a
haul
but
it
better
to
harden
your
heart
once
for
all
and
pay
it
down
the
two
guineas
is
only
the
beginning
the
beginning
of
what
trouble
said
sophie
grimly
baths
at
a
guinea
apiece
massage
a
time
medicine
liniments
change
of
air
my
dear
it
no
use
what
the
use
of
paying
two
guineas
to
hear
a
man
tell
you
to
do
a
dozen
things
which
are
hopelessly
impossible
it
paying
good
money
only
to
be
aggravated
and
depressed
if
it
comes
to
that
i
can
prescribe
for
myself
without
paying
a
sou
knock
off
all
work
for
a
year
go
to
egypt
or
some
perfectly
dry
climate
and
build
up
your
strength
always
get
out
of
london
for
the
winter
months
live
in
the
fresh
air
and
avoid
fatigue
how
that
does
that
strike
you
as
admirable
advice
she
put
her
head
on
one
side
with
a
gallant
attempt
at
a
smile
but
her
lips
twitched
and
the
flare
of
the
incandescent
light
showed
her
face
lined
and
drawn
with
pain
claire
was
silent
her
heart
cramping
with
pain
the
clock
ticked
on
for
several
minutes
before
she
asked
softly
have
you
no
savings
sophie
no
money
to
keep
you
if
you
take
a
rest
not
a
sou
it
all
i
can
do
to
struggle
along
i
told
you
i
had
to
help
a
young
sister
and
things
run
up
so
quickly
that
it
does
seem
possible
to
save
i
suppose
many
people
would
say
one
ought
to
be
able
to
do
it
on
a
hundred
a
year
that
all
i
have
left
for
myself
hundreds
of
women
manage
on
less
but
as
a
rule
they
come
from
a
different
class
and
can
put
up
with
a
style
of
living
which
would
be
intolerable
to
us
i
do
complain
of
the
pay
i
do
think
it
is
bad
as
things
go
it
only
when
illness
comes
that
one
looks
ahead
and
feels
frightened
suppose
i
broke
down
now
suppose
i
broke
down
in
ten
years
time
i
should
be
over
forty
and
after
working
hard
for
twenty
years
i
should
be
left
without
a
penny
piece
thrown
on
the
scrap
heap
as
a
thing
that
was
no
more
use
but
i
might
still
live
on
years
upon
years
oh
dear
why
did
you
make
me
think
of
it
it
does
no
good
only
gives
one
the
hump
there
no
pension
scheme
so
i
simply
ca
afford
to
be
that
the
end
of
it
do
you
think
if
you
went
to
miss
farnborough
and
explained
to
her
sophie
turned
a
flushed
protesting
face
never
not
for
the
world
and
you
must
either
promise
me
faithfully
that
you
will
never
give
so
much
as
a
hint
miss
farnborough
is
a
capital
head
but
her
great
consideration
is
for
the
pupils
we
only
count
in
so
far
as
we
are
valuable
to
them
she
be
sorry
for
me
of
course
and
would
give
me
quite
a
lot
of
advice
but
she
think
at
once
she
rheumatic
she
wo
be
so
capable
as
a
gym
mistress
i
must
get
some
one
else
no
no
my
dear
i
must
go
on
i
must
fight
it
out
you
be
surprised
to
see
how
i
fight
when
miss
farnborough
comes
on
the
scene
very
well
you
have
had
your
say
now
i
going
to
have
mine
if
you
go
on
as
you
have
been
doing
the
last
month
growing
stiffer
week
by
week
you
wo
be
to
hide
it
the
other
mistresses
talk
about
it
already
they
were
discussing
you
in
last
week
if
you
go
on
trusting
to
chance
you
are
simply
courting
disaster
now
tell
you
what
i
am
going
to
do
i
going
to
find
out
the
address
of
a
good
specialist
and
make
an
appointment
for
next
saturday
morning
you
sha
have
any
trouble
about
it
and
i
call
in
a
taxi
and
take
you
myself
and
bring
you
safely
back
and
it
will
be
the
wisest
and
the
cheapest
two
guineas
you
ever
spent
in
your
life
now
what
have
you
got
to
say
to
that
oh
i
do
know
i
do
know
you
are
very
kind
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
grateful
i
suppose
you
are
right
oh
i
go
i
suppose
i
must
go
cried
sophie
ungraciously
whereupon
claire
hastily
changed
the
conversation
and
made
no
further
reference
to
health
during
the
rest
of
her
visit
mrs
willoughby
supplied
the
name
of
a
specialist
the
specialist
granted
an
appointment
for
the
following
saturday
at
noon
when
the
two
girls
duly
appeared
in
his
and
sophie
underwent
the
usual
examination
during
which
the
great
doctor
face
assumed
a
serious
air
finally
he
returned
to
the
chair
which
stood
against
the
desk
and
faced
his
patient
across
the
room
sophie
was
looking
flushed
and
pretty
she
was
wearing
her
best
clothes
and
she
wore
them
with
an
air
which
might
well
delude
a
masculine
eye
into
believing
them
much
better
than
they
really
were
claire
had
her
usual
smart
appearance
they
seemed
to
the
doctor
eyes
two
prosperous
members
of
society
i
fear
he
said
gravely
i
fear
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
your
rheumatism
is
the
sort
most
difficult
to
treat
it
is
a
clear
case
of
rheumatoid
arthritis
but
you
are
young
and
the
disease
is
in
an
early
stage
so
that
we
must
hope
for
the
best
in
olden
times
it
was
supposed
to
be
an
incurable
complaint
but
of
late
years
we
have
had
occasional
cures
quite
remarkable
cures
which
have
mitigated
that
decision
you
must
realise
however
that
it
is
a
difficult
fight
and
that
you
will
need
much
patience
and
perseverance
how
soon
do
you
think
you
can
cure
me
the
doctor
looked
into
sophie
face
and
his
eyes
were
pitiful
i
wish
i
could
say
but
i
fear
that
impossible
different
people
are
affected
by
different
cures
you
must
go
on
experimenting
until
you
find
one
that
will
suit
your
case
meanwhile
there
are
certain
definite
instructions
which
you
would
do
well
to
observe
in
what
part
of
london
do
you
live
he
his
lips
at
the
reply
clay
heavy
clay
the
worst
thing
you
could
have
that
must
be
altered
at
once
it
is
essential
that
you
live
on
light
gravelly
soil
and
even
then
you
should
not
be
in
england
in
winter
you
should
go
abroad
for
four
or
five
months
sophie
cast
a
lightning
glance
at
her
companion
it
impossible
she
said
shortly
i
ca
move
i
ca
go
abroad
i
am
a
high
mistress
i
am
obliged
to
stay
at
my
work
i
am
dependent
on
my
salary
i
knew
it
was
stupid
to
come
i
knew
what
you
would
say
i
told
my
friend
it
was
her
doing
she
made
me
come
i
am
very
much
indebted
to
your
friend
the
doctor
said
genially
she
was
quite
right
to
insist
that
you
should
have
advice
and
now
that
i
know
the
circumstances
i
try
not
to
be
unreasonable
i
know
how
aggravating
it
must
be
to
be
ordered
to
do
things
which
are
clearly
impossible
but
you
are
young
and
you
are
threatened
with
a
disease
which
may
cripple
your
life
i
want
to
do
all
that
is
in
my
power
to
help
you
let
talk
it
over
quietly
and
see
what
can
be
done
i
in
school
every
day
until
four
except
on
saturdays
and
i
ca
afford
to
wait
i
get
better
and
i
must
be
quick
about
it
or
i
shall
lose
my
post
if
i
leave
this
school
through
rheumatism
it
will
go
down
in
my
testimonial
and
i
should
never
get
another
opening
i
the
gym
mistress
poor
girl
said
the
doctor
kindly
well
he
added
i
can
say
one
thing
for
your
encouragement
you
could
not
help
yourself
more
than
by
preserving
your
present
attitude
of
mind
to
determine
to
get
better
and
to
get
better
quickly
is
a
very
valuable
aid
to
material
means
and
now
i
will
tell
you
what
i
propose
he
bent
forward
in
his
chair
talking
earnestly
and
rapidly
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
since
the
disease
was
apt
to
take
sudden
leaps
forward
at
this
stage
every
day
was
of
value
the
enemy
must
be
attacked
before
he
had
made
good
his
hold
there
was
a
new
treatment
which
within
his
own
experience
had
had
excellent
results
it
was
not
a
certainty
it
was
very
far
from
a
certainty
but
it
was
a
chance
and
it
had
this
merit
that
a
month
or
six
weeks
would
prove
its
efficacy
in
any
special
case
if
this
failed
something
else
must
be
tried
but
most
cures
were
very
long
very
costly
he
would
propose
in
the
first
instance
giving
two
injections
a
week
later
on
three
or
even
four
there
might
be
a
certain
amount
of
reaction
what
do
you
mean
by
reaction
sophie
asked
fever
headache
possibly
sickness
but
not
lasting
for
more
than
hours
sophie
set
her
lips
i
have
no
time
to
be
ill
the
doctor
looked
at
her
with
deliberate
sternness
you
will
have
all
your
life
to
be
ill
if
you
do
not
take
care
now
i
will
do
what
i
can
to
help
you
we
will
arrange
the
times
most
convenient
to
you
you
might
come
to
me
at
first
direct
from
school
on
wednesdays
and
saturdays
later
on
the
system
will
accustom
itself
and
you
will
probably
feel
no
bad
effects
i
should
like
to
undertake
your
case
myself
my
charge
to
you
will
be
a
quarter
of
my
ordinary
fee
thank
you
very
much
stammered
sophie
but
claire
jumped
up
and
hastily
interposed
thank
you
so
very
much
we
are
most
grateful
but
it
it
been
rather
a
shock
and
we
have
not
had
time
to
think
will
you
allow
us
to
write
and
tell
you
our
decision
certainly
certainly
but
be
quick
about
it
i
am
anxious
to
help
but
every
week
delay
will
make
the
case
more
difficult
try
to
arrange
for
wednesday
next
as
he
spoke
he
led
the
way
towards
the
door
he
had
been
all
that
was
kind
and
considerate
but
there
were
other
patients
waiting
all
day
long
a
procession
of
sufferers
were
filing
into
that
room
he
had
no
more
time
to
give
to
sophie
blake
the
two
girls
went
out
into
the
street
got
into
a
taxi
and
were
driven
swiftly
away
neither
spoke
they
drew
up
before
the
door
of
sophie
lodgings
entered
the
cosy
and
sat
down
by
the
fire
well
sophie
face
was
flushed
her
eyes
were
dry
and
feverishly
bright
i
hope
you
are
satisfied
my
dear
i
been
to
a
specialist
to
please
you
and
a
most
depressing
entertainment
it
has
been
arthritis
that
the
thing
people
have
who
go
about
in
bath
chairs
and
have
horrible
twisted
fingers
it
was
supposed
to
be
incurable
but
now
they
have
occasional
cure
so
i
must
hope
for
the
best
i
do
think
doctors
are
the
stupidest
things
they
have
no
tact
he
could
tell
me
that
in
one
breath
and
in
the
other
that
it
was
most
important
that
i
should
have
hope
well
i
hope
i
faith
but
it
not
because
of
his
stupid
injections
i
believe
in
god
and
god
knows
that
i
need
my
health
and
that
other
people
need
it
too
my
little
sister
what
would
happen
to
her
if
i
crocked
now
i
believe
he
will
me
grow
worse
that
all
right
sophie
dear
but
ought
you
to
use
the
means
i
do
call
it
trusting
in
the
right
sense
if
you
set
yourself
against
the
help
that
comes
along
god
does
work
miracles
as
he
did
in
the
old
way
the
world
has
progressed
since
those
old
times
and
now
he
works
through
men
it
is
a
miracle
just
the
same
though
it
shows
itself
in
a
more
natural
fashion
do
you
call
it
a
miracle
that
a
busy
doctor
should
offer
to
treat
you
himself
at
the
hours
most
convenient
to
you
and
to
do
it
at
a
quarter
of
his
usual
fees
his
fee
for
was
two
guineas
they
always
charge
that
i
suppose
these
specialist
people
a
quarter
of
that
would
mean
guinea
a
visit
two
equal
one
guinea
later
on
three
or
four
a
week
would
equal
to
two
guineas
two
guineas
equal
my
whole
income
very
kind
no
doubt
very
kind
indeed
and
just
about
as
feasible
as
if
he
said
a
thousand
pounds
claire
was
busy
calculating
her
fingers
playing
upon
her
knee
ten
guineas
ought
to
pay
for
the
six
weeks
which
would
test
the
efficacy
of
the
vaccine
surely
there
could
not
be
any
serious
difficulty
about
ten
guineas
would
your
brother
sophie
shook
her
head
i
would
ask
him
he
has
four
small
children
and
he
does
so
much
for
emily
more
than
he
can
afford
he
works
too
hard
poor
fellow
if
it
were
a
certainty
perhaps
it
might
be
managed
somehow
but
only
a
chance
and
six
weeks
wo
see
the
end
but
the
end
will
be
quicker
if
you
begin
at
once
the
doctor
said
that
every
day
was
of
importance
sophie
listen
i
got
the
money
got
it
lying
in
the
bank
i
lend
it
to
you
i
love
to
lend
it
if
you
let
me
i
send
you
a
cheque
that
will
pay
for
the
first
six
weeks
sophie
stretched
out
her
hand
and
gave
a
momentary
clasp
to
fingers
you
a
good
soul
fancy
offering
that
to
a
stranger
like
me
it
noble
of
you
my
dear
perfectly
sweet
i
awfully
grateful
but
it
absolutely
impossible
that
i
could
accept
when
could
i
pay
you
back
i
never
been
able
to
save
but
i
kept
out
of
debt
and
it
would
worry
me
to
death
to
have
ten
pounds
hanging
round
my
neck
besides
we
should
be
any
further
at
the
end
of
the
six
weeks
i
should
either
be
better
in
which
case
he
would
certainly
want
me
to
go
on
or
worse
when
i
should
have
to
try
something
else
you
propose
that
i
should
go
on
borrowing
from
you
at
the
rate
of
one
or
two
guineas
a
week
i
i
afraid
i
have
got
it
to
give
very
well
then
there
you
are
what
the
good
of
beginning
at
all
claire
put
her
hands
over
her
face
and
thought
with
that
intense
and
selfless
thought
which
is
as
a
prayer
for
help
the
future
seemed
dark
indeed
and
the
feeling
of
helplessness
was
hard
to
bear
two
lonely
girls
with
no
one
to
help
and
so
much
help
that
was
needed
here
was
indeed
the
time
for
prayer
sophie
it
horribly
difficult
we
ca
see
ahead
we
can
only
the
next
thing
it
is
your
duty
to
take
this
cure
and
the
way
has
opened
for
that
when
we
come
to
the
end
of
the
six
weeks
it
may
open
again
you
said
you
have
trust
in
god
it
no
use
talking
generalities
if
you
are
not
prepared
to
put
your
faith
into
practice
the
question
for
is
you
trust
him
for
the
beginning
of
sophie
smiled
i
like
that
that
a
nice
way
of
putting
it
yes
i
can
but
claire
i
must
call
you
claire
you
are
such
a
dear
i
wish
it
did
mean
borrowing
other
people
money
it
will
be
years
before
i
can
pay
you
back
it
may
be
that
i
can
never
do
it
i
would
have
said
but
i
was
afraid
it
would
hurt
your
pride
my
stepfather
gave
me
some
money
to
buy
jewellery
for
a
wedding
present
and
as
a
pure
matter
of
selfishness
i
get
more
pleasure
out
of
helping
you
than
out
of
a
stupid
brooch
and
listen
sophie
listen
i
going
to
i
chose
to
take
up
teaching
because
i
wanted
to
be
independent
and
i
knew
my
mother
would
be
happier
without
me
during
the
first
years
of
her
marriage
but
she
is
devoted
to
me
and
i
know
in
time
she
will
crave
to
have
me
back
she
is
strong
and
she
finds
the
indian
climate
trying
so
very
likely
she
may
my
help
i
shall
never
be
sorry
that
i
came
to
london
for
work
is
a
splendid
experience
and
i
am
glad
to
have
it
but
i
have
never
the
feeling
that
it
is
going
to
mother
comes
first
and
my
stepfather
is
quite
and
can
afford
to
keep
me
so
if
i
were
i
should
not
feel
that
i
was
sacrificing
my
independence
in
letting
him
do
it
so
you
see
i
am
not
quite
in
the
same
position
as
the
other
mistresses
and
money
is
not
of
the
same
importance
if
you
were
in
my
place
sophie
would
you
hesitate
to
lend
me
a
note
guineas
please
cried
sophie
laughing
to
hide
her
tears
all
right
my
dear
all
right
i
give
in
i
lie
down
you
beaten
me
i
nothing
more
to
say
i
take
the
horrid
old
injections
and
pay
for
them
with
your
money
and
and
i
think
i
go
to
bed
now
please
i
had
about
as
much
as
i
can
bear
for
one
short
day
and
i
go
home
and
have
a
rest
myself
i
am
to
help
at
a
bazaar
this
afternoon
and
i
do
feel
at
all
in
my
full
beauty
sophie
cheer
up
there
a
good
time
coming
there
a
good
time
coming
for
predicted
sophie
confidently
chapter
fifteen
lend
me
five
pounds
the
contrasts
of
life
seemed
painfully
strong
to
claire
gifford
that
saturday
afternoon
as
she
seated
herself
in
the
luxurious
car
by
mrs
willoughby
side
and
thought
of
sophie
blake
obliged
to
borrow
ten
pounds
to
pay
for
a
chance
of
health
and
the
contrast
deepened
during
the
next
few
hours
as
she
watched
beautifully
gowned
women
squandering
money
on
useless
trifles
which
decked
the
various
stalls
embroidered
cushions
painted
sachets
veil
cases
shaving
cases
cases
bridge
bags
fan
bags
handkerchief
bags
work
bags
bags
of
every
size
of
every
shape
of
every
conceivable
material
bead
necklaces
mats
a
wilderness
of
mats
a
very
pyramid
of
work
claire
found
a
seat
near
the
principal
stall
where
she
caught
the
remarks
of
the
buyers
as
they
turned
away
i
detest
painted
satin
ca
think
why
i
bought
that
ridiculous
sachet
it
will
have
to
go
on
to
the
next
bazaar
that
makes
my
bag
rather
a
sweet
though
is
he
it
will
go
with
my
grey
dress
this
is
awful
i
not
getting
on
at
all
i
ca
decently
spend
less
than
five
pounds
for
goodness
sake
tell
me
what
to
buy
ca
think
why
people
give
bazaars
such
an
upset
in
the
house
for
some
charity
i
believe
i
forget
what
she
asked
me
to
come
so
on
and
so
on
scores
of
women
surging
to
and
fro
swinging
bags
of
gold
and
silver
chain
buying
baubles
for
which
they
had
no
use
occasionally
very
occasionally
for
love
of
the
cause
often
very
often
because
lady
had
sent
a
personal
invitation
and
lady
was
a
useful
friend
and
gave
such
charming
balls
at
the
two
concerts
claire
had
a
pleasant
success
which
she
enjoyed
with
all
her
heart
her
whistling
performance
seemed
to
act
as
a
general
introduction
for
every
listener
seemed
to
be
anxious
to
talk
to
her
and
to
ask
an
infinitude
of
questions
was
it
difficult
how
long
did
it
take
to
learn
was
she
nervous
was
it
difficult
not
to
laugh
how
did
she
manage
not
to
look
a
fright
did
she
do
it
often
did
she
this
last
question
usually
led
up
to
a
tentative
mention
of
some
entertainment
in
which
the
speaker
was
interested
but
after
the
first
refusal
claire
was
on
guard
and
regretted
that
her
time
was
filled
up
she
was
eager
to
help
mrs
willoughby
but
had
no
desire
to
be
turned
into
an
unpaid
public
performer
janet
did
not
appear
at
the
bazaar
so
the
drive
home
was
once
more
a
during
which
mrs
willoughby
questioned
claire
as
to
the
coming
holidays
and
expressed
pleasure
to
hear
that
they
were
to
be
spent
in
brussels
she
was
so
kind
and
motherly
in
her
manner
that
claire
was
emboldened
to
bespeak
her
interest
on
sophie
behalf
i
suppose
she
said
tentatively
you
do
know
of
any
family
going
abroad
to
a
dry
climate
it
must
be
a
very
dry
climate
who
would
like
to
take
a
girl
with
them
to
er
to
be
a
sort
of
help
she
a
pretty
girl
and
very
gay
and
amusing
and
she
had
the
highest
possible
training
in
health
exercises
she
would
be
splendid
if
there
was
a
delicate
child
who
needed
physical
development
and
of
course
she
is
quite
well
educated
all
round
she
could
teach
up
to
a
certain
point
she
is
the
gym
mistress
in
my
school
and
is
very
popular
with
the
girls
and
why
does
she
want
to
leave
she
not
well
it
rheumatism
a
bad
kind
of
rheumatism
it
is
just
beginning
and
the
doctor
says
it
ought
to
be
tackled
at
once
and
that
to
live
on
clay
soil
is
the
worst
thing
for
her
if
she
stays
at
saint
cuthbert
she
practically
bound
to
live
on
clay
and
he
says
she
ought
to
get
out
of
england
for
the
next
few
winters
she
has
not
a
penny
beyond
her
salary
but
if
she
could
find
a
post
well
why
not
mrs
willoughby
voice
was
full
of
a
cheerful
optimism
i
do
know
of
anything
at
present
but
i
make
inquiries
among
my
friends
there
ought
not
to
be
any
difficulty
so
many
people
winter
abroad
and
there
is
quite
a
craze
for
these
physical
exercises
oh
yes
my
dear
i
am
sure
i
can
help
poor
thing
poor
girl
it
so
important
to
keep
her
health
i
must
find
some
one
who
will
be
considerate
and
not
work
her
too
hard
she
spoke
as
if
the
post
were
a
settled
thing
as
if
there
were
several
posts
from
which
to
choose
probably
there
were
among
her
large
circle
of
wealthy
friends
this
popular
and
influential
woman
given
a
little
trouble
could
almost
certainly
find
a
chance
for
sophie
blake
a
little
that
was
the
rub
five
out
of
six
of
the
women
who
had
thronged
lady
rooms
that
afternoon
would
have
dismissed
sophie
case
with
an
easy
sympathy
poor
creature
quite
too
sad
but
really
you
know
my
dear
it
a
shocking
mistake
to
recommend
any
one
to
a
friend
if
anything
goes
wrong
you
get
blamed
yourself
is
there
a
home
mrs
willoughby
was
the
exception
to
the
rule
she
helped
in
deed
as
well
as
in
word
claire
looked
at
the
large
plain
face
with
a
very
passion
of
admiration
oh
i
wish
all
women
were
like
you
i
so
glad
you
are
rich
i
hope
you
will
go
on
growing
richer
and
richer
you
are
the
right
person
to
have
money
because
you
help
you
to
help
you
remember
other
women
who
are
poor
my
dear
said
mrs
willoughby
softly
i
have
been
poor
myself
my
father
lost
his
money
and
for
years
we
had
a
hard
struggle
then
i
married
for
love
my
dear
not
money
but
there
was
money
too
more
money
than
i
could
spend
it
was
an
intoxicating
experience
and
i
found
it
difficult
not
to
be
carried
away
my
dear
husband
had
settled
a
large
income
on
me
for
my
own
use
so
i
determined
as
a
safeguard
to
divide
it
in
two
and
use
half
for
myself
and
half
for
gentlewomen
like
your
friend
who
need
a
helping
hand
i
have
done
that
now
for
years
but
i
give
out
of
my
abundance
my
dear
it
is
easy
for
me
to
give
money
i
deserve
no
credit
for
that
you
give
time
too
and
sympathy
and
kindness
it
no
use
mrs
willoughby
i
put
you
on
the
topmost
pinnacle
in
my
mind
and
nothing
that
you
can
say
can
pull
you
down
i
think
you
are
the
best
woman
in
london
dear
dear
you
will
turn
my
head
i
not
accustomed
to
such
wholesale
flattery
cried
mrs
willoughby
laughing
then
the
car
stopped
and
claire
made
her
adieux
and
sprang
lightly
to
the
ground
the
chauffeur
had
stopped
before
the
wrong
house
but
he
did
not
discover
his
mistake
as
claire
purposely
stood
still
until
he
had
turned
the
car
and
started
to
retrace
his
way
westward
the
evening
was
fine
though
chill
and
the
air
was
refreshing
after
the
crowded
heat
of
lady
rooms
claire
had
only
the
length
of
a
block
to
walk
and
she
went
slowly
drawing
deep
breaths
to
fill
her
tired
lungs
the
afternoon
had
passed
pleasantly
enough
but
it
had
left
her
feeling
flat
and
depressed
she
questioned
herself
as
to
the
cause
of
her
depression
was
she
jealous
of
those
other
girls
who
lived
lives
of
luxury
and
idleness
honestly
she
was
not
she
was
not
in
the
position
of
a
girl
who
had
known
nothing
but
poverty
and
who
therefore
felt
a
girl
natural
longing
for
pretty
rooms
pretty
clothes
and
a
taste
of
gaiety
and
excitement
claire
had
known
all
these
things
and
could
know
them
again
neither
was
she
in
the
position
of
a
working
girl
who
has
no
one
to
help
in
the
day
of
adversity
for
a
comfortable
home
was
open
to
her
at
any
moment
no
she
was
not
jealous
she
probed
still
deeper
and
acknowledged
that
she
was
disappointed
last
time
that
she
had
whistled
in
public
claire
shook
her
head
with
an
impatient
toss
this
was
feeble
this
was
ridiculous
a
man
whom
she
had
met
twice
a
man
whose
mother
had
refused
an
introduction
a
man
whom
janet
i
must
get
to
work
and
prepare
my
lesson
for
monday
nothing
like
good
work
to
drive
away
these
sentimental
follies
but
fate
was
not
kind
for
right
before
her
eyes
were
a
couple
of
lovers
strolling
onward
the
man
hand
through
the
girl
arm
his
head
bent
low
over
hers
claire
winced
at
the
sight
but
the
next
moment
her
interest
quickened
in
a
somewhat
painful
fashion
as
the
man
straightened
himself
suddenly
and
swung
apart
with
a
gesture
of
offence
the
lovers
were
quarrelling
now
the
width
of
the
pavement
was
between
them
they
strode
onward
ostentatiously
detached
claire
smiled
to
herself
at
the
childishness
of
the
display
one
moment
embracing
in
the
open
street
the
next
flaunting
their
differences
so
boldly
that
every
must
realise
the
position
surely
a
grown
man
or
woman
ought
to
have
more
then
suddenly
the
light
of
a
lamp
shone
on
the
pair
and
she
recognised
the
familiar
figures
of
mary
rhodes
and
major
carew
he
wore
a
long
light
overcoat
cecil
had
evidently
slipped
out
of
the
house
to
meet
him
for
she
was
attired
in
her
sports
coat
and
knitted
cap
poor
cecil
the
interview
seemed
to
be
ending
in
anything
but
a
pleasant
fashion
claire
lingered
behind
until
the
couple
had
passed
her
own
doorway
let
herself
in
with
her
and
hastened
to
settle
down
to
work
when
cecil
came
in
she
would
not
wish
to
be
observed
claire
carried
her
books
to
the
bureau
so
as
to
have
her
back
to
the
fire
but
before
she
had
been
five
minutes
writing
she
heard
the
click
of
the
lock
and
cecil
herself
came
into
the
room
halloa
i
saw
the
light
go
up
i
thought
it
must
be
you
she
was
silent
for
a
couple
of
minutes
then
spoke
again
in
a
sharp
summoning
voice
claire
yes
claire
turned
round
to
behold
cecil
standing
at
the
end
of
the
table
her
bare
hands
clasping
its
rim
she
was
so
white
that
her
lips
looked
of
a
startling
redness
her
eyes
met
claire
with
a
defiant
hardness
i
want
you
to
lend
me
five
pounds
claire
anxiety
was
swallowed
in
a
rising
of
irritation
which
brought
an
edge
of
coldness
into
her
voice
five
pounds
what
for
cecil
i
have
never
spoken
of
it
i
have
never
worried
you
but
i
already
paid
i
know
i
know
i
pay
you
back
but
i
must
have
this
and
i
nowhere
else
to
go
it
important
i
would
lend
it
to
you
claire
if
it
were
in
my
power
cecil
i
hate
to
refuse
but
really
i
my
money
just
now
i
need
it
particularly
i
ca
afford
to
go
on
lending
i
dreadfully
sorry
but
claire
please
i
implore
you
just
this
one
time
i
pay
you
back
there
my
insurance
policy
i
can
raise
something
on
that
for
pity
sake
claire
help
me
this
time
claire
rose
silently
and
went
upstairs
it
was
not
in
her
to
refuse
such
a
request
while
a
note
lay
in
her
desk
upstairs
she
slipped
the
crackling
paper
into
an
envelope
and
carried
it
down
to
the
parlour
cecil
took
it
without
a
word
and
went
back
into
the
night
when
she
had
gone
claire
gathered
her
papers
together
in
a
neat
little
heap
ranged
them
in
a
corner
of
the
bureau
and
seated
herself
on
a
chair
at
the
end
of
the
table
she
looked
as
if
she
were
mounted
on
a
seat
of
justice
and
the
position
suited
her
frame
of
mind
she
felt
angry
and
cecil
had
no
right
to
borrow
money
from
a
the
money
in
the
bank
was
dwindling
rapidly
the
ten
guineas
for
sophie
would
make
another
big
hole
she
did
not
grudge
that
she
was
eager
and
ready
to
give
it
for
so
good
a
cause
but
was
cecil
doing
with
these
repeated
loans
to
judge
from
appearances
she
was
rather
poorer
than
richer
during
the
last
few
months
while
bills
for
her
new
clothes
came
in
again
and
again
and
received
no
settlement
an
obstinate
look
settled
on
claire
face
she
determined
to
have
this
thing
out
in
ten
minutes
time
cecil
was
back
again
still
white
still
defiant
meeting
claire
glance
with
a
shrug
seating
herself
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
table
with
an
air
of
callous
indifference
to
what
should
come
next
well
well
you
look
as
if
you
had
something
to
say
i
have
cecil
what
are
you
doing
with
all
this
money
that
my
business
i
suppose
i
do
see
it
when
the
money
is
mine
i
think
i
have
the
right
to
ask
i
told
you
i
pay
you
back
that
not
the
question
i
want
to
know
what
you
are
doing
you
are
not
paying
your
bills
i
sell
out
some
shares
and
you
shall
do
no
such
thing
i
can
wait
and
i
will
wait
but
i
go
on
lending
and
if
i
did
it
could
do
you
no
good
where
does
the
money
go
it
does
no
good
i
am
the
best
judge
of
that
cecil
you
lending
money
to
that
the
words
leapt
out
as
on
occasion
such
words
will
leap
without
thought
or
premeditation
on
the
speaker
part
she
did
not
intend
to
speak
them
if
she
had
given
herself
one
moment
for
reflection
she
dared
not
have
spoken
them
when
their
sound
struck
across
the
quiet
room
she
was
almost
as
much
startled
as
cecil
herself
yet
heart
and
brain
approved
their
utterance
heart
and
brain
pronounced
that
she
had
discovered
the
truth
cecil
face
was
a
deep
glowing
red
really
claire
you
go
too
far
why
in
the
world
should
you
think
i
saw
you
with
him
now
in
the
street
i
could
see
that
you
were
quarrelling
you
took
no
pains
to
hide
it
you
left
him
to
come
in
to
me
and
went
back
again
it
seems
pretty
obvious
well
and
if
i
did
cecil
had
plainly
decided
that
denial
was
useless
i
am
responsible
for
the
loan
what
does
it
matter
to
you
who
uses
it
but
at
that
claire
anger
vanished
and
she
shrank
back
with
a
cry
of
pain
and
shame
and
he
it
from
you
money
took
it
from
a
girl
he
professes
to
love
who
is
working
for
herself
oh
cecil
how
he
how
could
you
allow
him
how
can
you
go
on
caring
for
such
a
man
do
get
hysterical
claire
please
there
nothing
so
extraordinary
in
a
man
being
hard
up
it
happened
before
now
in
the
history
of
the
world
frank
has
a
position
to
keep
up
and
his
father
i
told
you
before
how
mean
and
difficult
his
father
is
and
it
so
important
that
frank
should
keep
on
good
terms
just
he
dare
not
worry
him
for
money
when
he
is
going
to
make
me
a
rich
woman
some
day
why
should
i
refuse
to
lend
him
a
few
trifling
pounds
when
he
runs
short
he
in
an
expensive
regiment
he
belongs
to
an
expensive
club
he
is
obliged
to
keep
up
with
the
other
men
if
i
had
twice
as
much
i
would
lend
it
with
pleasure
claire
opened
her
lips
to
say
that
at
least
no
more
borrowed
money
should
be
supplied
for
major
carew
but
the
words
were
never
spoken
pity
engulfed
her
a
passion
of
pity
for
the
poor
woman
who
a
second
time
had
fallen
under
the
spell
of
an
unscrupulous
man
explanation
had
fallen
on
deaf
ears
for
claire
could
accept
no
excuses
for
a
man
who
borrowed
from
a
woman
to
ensure
comfort
and
luxury
for
himself
an
officer
in
the
king
army
the
thing
seemed
incredible
so
incredible
that
for
the
first
time
a
rising
of
suspicion
mingled
with
her
dislike
mentally
she
rehearsed
the
facts
of
major
history
as
narrated
by
himself
and
found
herself
doubting
every
one
the
beautiful
house
in
the
country
did
it
really
exist
the
eccentric
old
father
who
refused
to
part
with
his
gold
was
he
flesh
and
blood
or
a
fictitious
figure
invented
as
a
convenient
excuse
the
fortune
which
was
to
enrich
the
future
there
such
a
fortune
or
if
there
were
was
major
carew
in
truth
the
eldest
son
claire
felt
a
devastating
helplessness
her
life
abroad
had
left
her
ignorant
of
many
british
institutions
she
knew
nothing
of
the
books
in
which
she
might
have
traced
the
carew
history
she
had
nothing
to
guide
her
but
her
own
feminine
instinct
but
if
that
instinct
were
right
what
was
to
become
of
mary
rhodes
her
face
looked
so
sad
so
downcast
that
cecil
conscience
was
pricked
poor
old
claire
she
said
gently
how
i
do
worry
you
to
be
sure
never
mind
my
dear
i
make
it
up
to
you
one
day
you
been
a
brick
to
me
and
i
sha
forget
it
and
i
go
to
my
mother
for
the
whole
of
the
easter
holidays
and
save
up
my
pennies
to
pay
you
back
the
poor
old
soul
felt
defrauded
because
i
stayed
only
a
week
at
christmas
so
she
be
thankful
to
have
me
you
can
go
to
brussels
with
an
easy
mind
knowing
that
i
out
of
temptation
that
will
be
killing
two
birds
with
one
stone
what
do
you
say
to
having
cocoa
now
instead
of
waiting
till
nine
we
tired
ourselves
out
with
all
this
fuss
chapter
sixteen
the
meeting
in
hyde
park
it
was
the
end
of
may
the
weather
was
warm
and
sunny
the
windows
of
the
west
end
were
gay
with
flowers
in
the
park
the
great
beds
of
rhododendrons
blazed
forth
in
a
glow
of
beauty
it
was
the
season
and
a
particularly
gay
and
festive
season
at
that
everybody
was
in
town
including
a
few
million
nobodies
there
were
clerks
toiling
by
their
thousands
in
the
city
chained
all
day
long
to
their
desks
there
were
clerks
wives
at
home
in
the
suburbs
toiling
all
day
too
and
sometimes
far
into
the
night
there
were
typists
and
shop
assistants
and
prosperous
heads
of
households
who
worked
steadily
for
five
and
a
half
days
a
week
in
order
that
their
families
might
enjoy
comfort
and
ease
condensing
their
own
relaxation
into
short
saturday
afternoons
and
there
were
too
who
saw
the
sun
through
windows
but
felt
its
call
all
the
same
the
call
of
the
whole
glad
spring
and
grew
restless
and
nervous
and
short
in
temper
it
was
not
the
leaders
of
society
whom
they
envied
they
read
of
court
balls
and
garden
parties
of
preparations
for
ascot
and
henley
with
a
serene
detachment
just
as
they
read
with
indifference
in
the
fashion
page
of
a
daily
newspaper
that
square
watches
are
the
vogue
this
season
and
our
are
ordering
several
specimens
of
this
dainty
bauble
to
match
the
prevailing
colours
of
their
costumes
the
while
they
suffered
real
pangs
at
the
sight
of
an
alarming
sacrifice
at
and
six
the
one
was
almost
within
their
grasp
the
other
floated
in
the
nebulous
atmosphere
of
a
different
sphere
in
the
at
the
staff
grew
restless
and
critical
the
hot
joints
no
longer
appealed
to
their
appetites
the
watery
vegetables
and
heavy
puddings
became
things
abhorred
they
thought
of
cool
salads
and
on
ice
and
hated
the
sight
of
the
greasy
brown
gravy
they
blamed
the
cook
they
blamed
the
committee
they
said
repeatedly
nobody
thinks
of
and
exchanged
anecdotes
illustrative
of
the
dulness
the
stupidity
of
their
pupils
as
for
the
matric
candidates
they
would
fail
there
was
a
chance
for
a
single
one
the
stupidest
set
of
girls
the
school
had
ever
possessed
oh
certainly
they
would
all
fail
and
then
said
mary
rhodes
bitterly
shall
be
blamed
the
arts
mistress
said
with
a
sigh
oh
would
it
be
heavenly
to
run
away
from
it
all
and
have
a
end
in
the
country
the
gorse
will
be
out
and
the
hawthorn
still
in
blossom
what
the
very
cheapest
one
could
do
it
on
for
two
days
mademoiselle
said
absolutely
there
is
no
help
for
it
it
is
necessary
that
i
have
a
distraction
i
must
buy
a
new
hat
sophie
blake
said
defiantly
to
herself
crippled
ridiculous
i
to
be
crippled
i
want
to
run
and
run
and
run
and
run
and
dance
and
sing
and
jump
about
i
feel
pent
i
feel
caged
and
all
that
precious
money
squandered
on
injections
the
six
weeks
course
of
treatment
had
been
from
the
doctor
point
of
view
a
complete
success
from
sophie
a
big
disappointment
she
argued
that
she
was
still
stiff
still
in
pain
that
the
improvement
was
but
small
he
pointed
out
that
without
the
injections
she
would
of
a
certainty
have
been
worse
and
since
in
arthritis
even
to
remain
stationary
was
a
success
to
have
improved
in
the
smallest
degree
in
six
weeks
time
might
be
regarded
as
a
triumph
he
prescribed
a
restful
holiday
during
the
easter
vacation
and
a
second
course
of
treatment
on
her
return
sophie
resigned
herself
to
do
without
new
clothes
for
the
summer
and
sold
her
most
treasured
possession
a
diamond
ring
which
had
belonged
to
her
mother
so
that
the
second
ten
pounds
was
secure
but
how
was
she
to
pay
back
the
original
loan
meanwhile
mrs
willoughby
was
inquiring
among
her
friends
for
a
suitable
post
and
had
played
the
good
fairy
by
arranging
to
send
sophie
for
the
easter
holidays
to
a
country
cottage
on
the
surrey
heights
which
she
ran
as
a
health
resort
for
gentlewomen
here
on
a
fine
dry
soil
the
air
scented
with
the
fragrant
breath
of
the
pines
with
nothing
to
do
and
plenty
of
appetising
food
to
eat
the
gym
mistress
general
health
improved
so
rapidly
that
she
came
back
to
school
with
her
thin
cheeks
quite
filled
out
very
satisfactory
said
the
doctor
now
i
shall
be
able
to
get
on
to
stronger
doses
what
the
good
of
getting
better
only
to
be
made
worse
cried
sophie
in
rebellion
cecil
loan
remained
unpaid
she
had
spent
her
holidays
with
her
mother
as
arranged
but
her
finances
did
not
appear
to
have
profited
thereby
dunning
for
bills
became
so
incessant
that
the
landlady
spoke
severely
of
the
credit
of
the
house
she
went
out
constantly
in
the
evening
and
several
times
claire
heard
major
carew
voice
at
the
door
but
he
never
came
into
the
house
and
there
was
no
talk
of
an
open
engagement
as
for
claire
herself
she
had
had
a
happy
time
in
brussels
staying
with
both
english
and
belgian
friends
and
all
the
old
haunts
she
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
change
but
could
not
honestly
say
that
she
wished
the
old
life
to
return
if
she
came
back
with
a
heavy
heart
it
was
neither
poverty
nor
work
which
she
feared
but
rather
the
want
of
that
atmosphere
of
love
and
kindliness
which
make
the
very
essence
of
home
at
the
best
of
times
mary
rhodes
was
a
difficult
companion
and
far
from
affectionate
in
manner
but
since
the
giving
of
that
last
loan
there
had
arisen
a
mental
barrier
which
it
seemed
impossible
to
surmount
it
had
become
difficult
to
keep
up
a
conversation
apart
from
school
topics
and
both
girls
found
themselves
dreading
the
evening
claire
felt
like
a
caged
bird
beating
against
the
bars
she
wanted
an
outlet
from
the
school
life
and
the
call
of
the
spring
was
insistent
to
one
who
until
now
had
spent
the
summer
in
wandering
about
some
of
the
loveliest
scenes
in
europe
she
wearied
of
the
everlasting
streets
and
discovered
that
by
hurrying
home
after
afternoon
school
making
a
quick
change
of
clothing
and
catching
a
at
the
corner
of
the
road
she
could
reach
hyde
park
by
five
and
spend
a
happy
hour
sitting
on
one
of
the
green
chairs
enjoying
the
beauty
of
the
flowers
and
watching
the
stream
of
pedestrians
and
vehicles
sometimes
she
recognised
mrs
willoughby
and
janet
bowling
past
in
their
luxurious
motor
but
they
never
saw
her
and
she
was
not
anxious
that
they
should
what
she
wanted
was
to
sit
still
and
rest
sometimes
a
woman
obviously
american
would
seat
herself
on
the
next
chair
and
inquire
as
to
the
best
chance
of
seeing
the
queen
and
the
question
being
amiably
answered
would
proceed
to
unasked
confidences
she
thought
england
sweet
she
had
just
come
over
to
this
side
she
was
staying
till
the
fall
who
was
the
lady
in
the
elegant
blue
auto
the
london
fashions
were
just
too
cute
when
they
parted
the
fair
american
invariably
said
pleased
to
have
met
you
and
looked
as
though
she
meant
it
into
the
bargain
and
claire
heartedly
echoed
the
sentiment
she
liked
these
women
with
their
keen
enthusiasm
their
friendly
gracious
ways
in
contrast
to
them
the
ordinary
englishwoman
seemed
cold
and
aloof
one
brilliant
afternoon
when
the
park
was
unusually
bright
and
gay
claire
was
seated
near
the
achilles
statue
carelessly
scanning
the
when
with
a
sudden
leap
of
the
heart
she
saw
erskine
fanshawe
some
twenty
yards
ahead
strolling
towards
her
accompanied
by
two
ladies
he
was
talking
to
his
companions
with
every
appearance
of
enjoyment
and
had
no
attention
to
spare
for
the
rows
of
spectators
on
the
massed
green
chairs
claire
felt
the
blood
rush
to
her
face
in
the
shock
of
surprise
and
agitation
she
had
never
contemplated
the
possibility
of
such
a
meeting
for
captain
fanshawe
had
not
appeared
the
type
of
man
who
would
care
to
take
part
in
a
fashionable
parade
and
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
familiar
face
among
the
crowd
made
her
heart
leap
with
a
force
that
was
physically
painful
then
the
excitement
over
she
realised
with
a
second
pang
almost
as
painful
as
the
first
that
in
another
minute
he
would
have
passed
by
unseeing
unknowing
to
disappear
into
space
for
probably
months
to
come
at
the
thought
rebellion
arose
in
her
heart
she
felt
a
wild
impulse
to
leave
her
seat
and
advance
towards
him
she
longed
with
a
sudden
desperation
of
longing
to
meet
his
eyes
to
see
his
smile
but
pride
held
her
back
she
sat
motionless
watching
with
strained
eyes
one
of
captain
fanshawe
companions
was
old
the
other
young
a
pretty
girl
who
appeared
abundantly
content
with
her
escort
all
three
were
watching
with
amusement
the
movements
of
a
stout
elderly
dame
who
sauntered
immediately
ahead
leading
by
a
leash
a
french
poodle
fantastically
shaved
and
decorated
with
ribbon
bows
the
stout
dame
was
evidently
extravagantly
devoted
to
her
pet
and
viewed
with
alarm
the
approach
of
a
jaunty
black
and
white
terrier
the
terrier
cocked
his
ears
and
elevating
his
stump
of
a
tail
yapped
at
the
spaniel
with
all
a
terrier
contempt
as
he
advanced
to
the
attack
the
stout
dame
screamed
dropped
the
leash
and
hit
at
the
terrier
with
the
handle
of
her
parasol
the
poodle
evidently
considering
flight
the
best
policy
doubled
and
fled
in
the
direction
of
the
green
chairs
to
come
violently
to
anchor
against
claire
knee
the
crowd
stared
the
stout
dame
hurried
forward
claire
placing
a
soothing
hand
on
the
dog
head
lifted
a
flushed
smiling
face
and
in
so
doing
caught
the
lift
of
a
hat
met
for
the
moment
the
glance
of
startled
eyes
the
stout
lady
was
not
at
all
grateful
she
spoke
as
sharply
as
though
claire
and
claire
alone
had
been
the
cause
of
her
pet
upset
she
strode
majestically
away
leaving
claire
trembling
confused
living
over
again
those
short
moments
she
had
seen
him
he
had
seen
her
he
was
alive
and
well
living
within
a
few
miles
of
herself
yet
as
far
apart
as
in
another
continent
it
was
six
months
since
they
had
last
met
it
might
be
six
years
before
they
met
again
but
he
had
seemed
pleased
to
see
her
short
as
had
been
that
passing
glance
there
was
no
mistaking
its
interest
he
was
surprised
but
pleasure
had
overridden
surprise
if
he
had
been
alone
he
would
have
hurried
forward
with
outstretched
hand
in
imagination
she
could
see
him
coming
his
grave
face
lightened
with
joy
oh
if
he
had
been
alone
but
he
was
with
friends
he
had
the
air
of
being
content
and
interested
and
the
girl
was
pretty
far
prettier
than
janet
willoughby
good
afternoon
she
turned
gasping
he
was
standing
before
her
holding
out
his
hand
he
had
left
his
companions
and
come
back
to
join
her
his
face
looked
flushed
as
though
he
had
rushed
back
at
express
speed
he
had
seemed
interested
and
content
and
the
girl
was
pretty
yet
he
had
come
back
to
her
he
seated
himself
on
the
chair
by
her
side
and
looked
at
her
with
eager
eyes
i
have
seen
you
for
six
months
i
was
just
claire
began
impulsively
drew
herself
up
and
finished
demurely
i
suppose
it
is
you
have
been
at
either
of
mrs
willoughby
homes
no
but
i
seen
a
good
deal
of
them
all
the
same
they
have
been
so
kind
do
you
care
for
the
homes
i
asked
mrs
willoughby
about
you
and
she
seemed
to
imply
that
you
preferred
not
to
go
oh
no
oh
no
that
was
quite
wrong
i
enjoy
that
evening
it
was
a
a
misunderstanding
i
think
said
claire
much
exercised
to
find
an
explanation
of
what
could
really
not
be
explained
of
the
third
at
home
she
had
heard
nothing
until
this
moment
and
a
pang
of
retrospective
disappointment
mingled
with
her
present
content
i
have
been
to
the
house
several
times
when
they
were
alone
she
continued
eagerly
they
even
asked
me
on
christmas
day
i
know
he
said
shortly
i
was
in
saint
moritz
skating
in
the
sunshine
when
i
heard
how
you
were
spending
christmas
holidays
his
face
looked
suddenly
grim
and
set
a
man
feels
pretty
helpless
at
a
time
like
that
i
did
exactly
enjoy
myself
for
the
rest
of
that
afternoon
that
was
stupid
of
you
but
but
very
nice
all
the
same
claire
said
softly
it
would
have
made
things
easier
for
me
if
other
people
had
been
dull
and
after
all
i
came
off
better
than
i
expected
you
were
all
alone
in
your
grand
hotel
only
for
a
week
claire
resolutely
ignored
the
hit
then
my
friend
came
back
and
we
made
some
little
excursions
together
and
enjoyed
being
lazy
and
getting
up
late
and
reading
lots
of
nice
books
i
had
made
all
sorts
of
good
resolutions
about
the
work
i
was
going
to
get
through
in
the
holidays
but
i
never
did
one
thing
do
you
often
come
to
the
park
claire
felt
a
pang
of
regret
was
it
possible
that
even
this
simple
pleasure
was
to
be
denied
her
she
knew
too
well
that
if
she
said
yes
captain
fanshawe
would
look
out
for
her
again
would
come
with
the
express
intention
of
meeting
her
to
say
yes
would
be
virtually
to
consent
to
such
meetings
it
was
a
temptation
which
took
all
her
strength
to
reject
but
rejected
it
must
be
she
would
not
stoop
to
the
making
of
a
i
have
been
several
times
but
i
sha
be
able
to
come
any
more
we
get
busier
towards
the
end
of
the
term
examinations
captain
fanshawe
straightened
himself
and
said
in
a
very
stiff
voice
i
also
unfortunately
am
extremely
busy
so
i
shall
not
be
able
to
see
the
rhododendrons
in
their
full
beauty
i
had
hoped
you
might
be
more
fortunate
claire
stared
at
a
passing
motor
of
which
she
saw
nothing
but
a
moving
mass
when
she
turned
back
it
was
to
find
her
companion
eyes
fixed
on
her
face
with
an
expression
half
guilty
half
appealing
altogether
ingratiating
at
the
sight
her
lips
twitched
and
suddenly
they
were
laughing
together
with
a
delicious
consciousness
of
understanding
well
he
cried
it
true
i
mean
it
there
no
need
to
stay
away
because
of
me
but
as
i
here
and
it
my
last
chance
you
let
me
give
you
tea
if
we
walk
along
to
victoria
gate
claire
thought
with
a
spasm
of
longing
of
the
little
tables
under
the
awning
of
the
pretty
animated
scene
but
no
it
might
not
be
her
acquaintance
with
this
man
was
too
casual
to
allow
her
to
accept
his
hospitality
in
a
public
place
thank
you
very
much
but
i
think
not
i
would
rather
stay
here
well
at
any
rate
he
said
defiantly
i
paid
for
my
chair
and
you
ca
turn
me
out
of
course
you
can
move
yourself
but
i
do
want
to
move
i
like
being
here
i
very
glad
to
see
you
i
should
like
very
much
to
have
tea
too
oh
if
you
understand
i
ca
explain
cried
poor
claire
helplessly
and
instantly
the
man
expression
altered
to
one
of
sympathy
and
contrition
i
do
understand
do
mind
what
i
say
naturally
it
annoying
but
you
right
i
suppose
you
perfectly
right
i
am
glad
at
any
rate
that
you
allow
me
to
talk
to
you
for
a
few
minutes
you
are
looking
very
well
his
eyes
took
her
in
in
one
rapid
comprehensive
sweep
and
claire
thanked
providence
that
she
had
put
on
her
prettiest
dress
i
am
glad
that
you
are
keeping
fit
did
you
enjoy
your
holiday
in
belgium
how
did
you
know
i
was
in
belgium
he
laughed
easily
but
ignored
the
question
you
have
good
news
of
your
mother
i
hope
very
good
she
loves
the
life
and
is
very
happy
and
interested
and
my
stepfather
writes
that
his
friends
refuse
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
a
daughter
he
is
so
proud
of
her
youthful
looks
how
much
did
you
tell
her
about
your
christmas
holidays
all
the
nice
bits
i
do
approve
of
burdening
other
people
evidently
not
then
there
have
been
burdens
you
implied
that
nothing
by
any
chance
in
which
a
man
fairly
intelligent
and
in
this
instance
keen
after
work
could
possibly
be
of
some
use
the
two
pairs
of
eyes
met
gazed
held
one
another
steadily
for
a
long
eloquent
moment
yes
said
claire
captain
fanshawe
bent
forward
quickly
holding
his
stick
between
his
knees
the
side
of
his
neck
had
flushed
a
dull
red
colour
for
several
moments
he
did
not
speak
claire
had
a
curious
feeling
that
he
could
not
trust
his
voice
good
he
said
shortly
at
last
now
may
i
hear
i
should
like
very
much
to
ask
you
some
questions
about
about
a
man
whom
i
think
you
may
know
the
grey
eyes
came
back
to
her
face
keen
and
surprised
yes
who
is
he
a
major
carew
his
christian
name
is
frank
he
belongs
to
your
club
i
know
the
fellow
yes
what
do
you
want
to
know
about
him
everything
i
think
everything
you
can
tell
me
you
know
him
personally
then
you
met
him
somewhere
yes
claire
answered
to
the
last
question
and
i
anxious
interested
to
know
more
do
you
know
his
people
or
anything
about
him
i
do
know
them
personally
i
know
carew
very
slightly
good
family
i
believe
fine
old
place
in
surrey
the
elizabethan
manor
house
was
true
then
claire
felt
relieved
but
not
yet
satisfied
her
suspicion
was
so
that
it
was
not
easily
dispelled
she
sat
silent
for
a
moment
considering
her
next
question
is
he
the
eldest
son
i
believe
he
is
i
always
understood
so
the
eldest
son
of
a
good
family
possessing
a
fine
old
place
claire
summoned
before
her
the
picture
of
the
coarse
man
who
had
tried
to
flirt
with
her
in
the
presence
of
the
woman
to
whom
he
was
engaged
a
man
who
stooped
to
borrow
money
from
a
girl
who
worked
for
her
own
living
excuse
could
there
be
for
such
a
man
she
drew
her
brows
together
in
puzzled
fashion
and
said
slowly
then
surely
if
he
is
the
heir
he
ought
to
be
rich
it
does
necessarily
follow
i
should
say
carew
was
not
at
all
flush
landed
property
is
an
expensive
luxury
in
these
days
heard
too
that
the
father
is
a
bit
of
a
miser
he
may
not
be
generous
in
the
matter
of
allowance
claire
sat
staring
ahead
buried
in
thought
and
captain
fanshawe
stared
at
her
in
his
turn
and
wondered
once
more
why
this
particular
girl
was
different
from
every
other
girl
and
why
in
her
presence
he
felt
a
fullness
of
happiness
and
content
she
was
very
pretty
but
pretty
girls
were
no
novelty
in
his
life
he
knew
them
by
the
score
it
was
not
her
beauty
which
attracted
him
but
a
mysterious
affinity
which
made
her
seem
nearer
to
him
than
he
had
hitherto
believed
it
possible
for
any
human
creature
to
be
he
had
recognised
this
mysterious
quality
at
their
first
meeting
he
had
felt
it
more
strongly
at
mrs
at
home
six
months
absence
had
not
diminished
his
interest
just
now
when
he
had
caught
sight
of
her
flushed
upturned
face
his
heart
had
leapt
with
a
violence
which
startled
him
out
of
his
ordinary
calm
something
had
happened
to
him
when
he
had
time
he
must
think
the
thing
out
and
discover
its
meaning
but
how
did
she
come
to
be
so
uncommonly
interested
in
carew
he
met
claire
eyes
and
she
asked
falteringly
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
what
you
think
of
him
personally
do
you
think
he
is
nice
tell
me
first
what
you
think
yourself
honestly
you
wo
mind
not
one
single
little
bit
i
told
you
he
is
a
mere
acquaintance
then
said
claire
deliberately
i
think
he
is
the
most
horrible
detestable
insufferable
altogether
despicable
creature
i
have
ever
met
in
the
whole
of
my
life
what
what
i
say
you
down
on
him
captain
fanshawe
stared
beamed
with
an
obvious
relief
then
hastened
to
defend
an
absent
man
you
wrong
you
know
really
you
wrong
i
do
call
carew
the
most
attractive
fellow
you
can
meet
rather
rough
manners
do
you
know
but
he
all
right
carew
all
right
you
must
judge
by
appearances
miss
gifford
some
of
the
most
decent
fellows
in
the
club
are
in
his
set
upon
my
word
i
think
he
is
quite
a
good
sort
captain
fanshawe
waxed
the
more
eloquent
as
claire
preserved
her
expression
of
incredulous
dislike
he
looked
at
her
curiously
and
said
i
suppose
i
must
ask
i
suppose
you
could
tell
me
exactly
why
you
are
so
interested
in
carew
i
afraid
not
no
i
afraid
i
ca
claire
said
regretfully
then
suddenly
there
flashed
through
her
mind
a
remembrance
of
the
many
tangles
and
misunderstandings
which
take
place
in
books
for
want
of
a
little
sensible
she
looked
into
captain
fanshawe
face
with
her
pretty
eyes
and
said
honestly
i
wanted
to
know
about
him
for
the
sake
of
another
person
to
do
with
myself
i
have
only
met
him
twice
i
hope
i
shall
never
meet
him
again
thank
you
said
the
man
simply
and
at
the
time
neither
of
the
two
realised
the
full
significance
of
those
quiet
words
it
was
only
on
living
over
the
interview
on
her
return
home
that
claire
remembered
and
understood
for
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
they
abandoned
the
personal
note
and
discussed
the
various
topics
of
the
hour
they
did
not
always
agree
and
neither
was
of
the
type
to
be
easily
swayed
from
a
preconceived
opinion
but
always
they
were
interested
always
they
felt
a
sympathy
for
the
other
view
never
once
was
there
a
fraction
of
a
pause
they
had
so
much
to
say
that
they
could
have
talked
for
hours
gradually
the
park
began
to
empty
the
string
of
motors
grew
less
the
crowd
on
the
footpath
no
longer
lounged
but
walked
quickly
with
a
definite
purpose
the
green
chairs
stood
in
rows
without
a
single
occupant
claire
looked
round
realised
her
isolation
drew
an
involuntary
sigh
and
rose
in
her
turn
it
getting
late
i
must
be
hurrying
home
i
go
to
the
marble
arch
and
take
a
please
do
let
me
take
you
out
of
your
way
he
looked
at
her
straightly
but
did
not
reply
and
they
paced
together
down
the
broad
roadway
past
the
sunken
beds
of
rhododendrons
with
the
fountain
playing
in
the
centre
towards
the
archway
which
seemed
to
both
so
unnecessarily
near
claire
thought
of
the
six
months
which
lay
behind
saw
before
her
a
vision
of
months
ahead
unenlightened
by
another
meeting
and
felt
suddenly
tired
and
chill
captain
fanshawe
frowned
and
bit
at
his
lower
lip
i
am
going
away
we
shall
be
in
camp
in
august
i
am
taking
part
of
my
leave
to
run
up
to
scotland
but
i
can
always
come
to
town
if
i
needed
or
if
there
a
special
inducement
i
came
up
for
both
the
willoughbys
homes
did
you
claire
said
feebly
and
fell
the
inference
was
too
plain
to
be
misunderstood
the
special
inducement
in
this
instance
had
been
the
hope
of
meeting
herself
actually
it
would
appear
that
he
had
travelled
some
distance
to
ensure
this
chance
but
the
chance
had
been
deliberately
denied
kind
mrs
willoughby
would
have
welcomed
her
with
open
arms
it
was
janet
who
had
laid
the
ban
janet
was
friendly
almost
affectionate
as
spring
progressed
she
had
repeatedly
called
at
saint
cuthbert
after
afternoon
school
and
carried
claire
off
for
refreshing
country
drives
quite
evidently
she
enjoyed
claire
society
quite
evidently
also
she
preferred
to
enjoy
it
when
other
visitors
were
not
present
claire
was
not
offended
for
she
knew
that
there
was
no
taint
of
snobbishness
in
this
decision
she
was
just
sorry
and
in
a
curious
fashion
remorseful
into
the
bargain
she
did
not
argue
out
the
point
but
instinctively
she
felt
that
janet
not
herself
was
the
one
to
be
pitied
they
reached
the
end
of
the
footpath
in
another
minute
they
would
be
in
the
noise
and
bustle
of
oxford
street
erskine
fanshawe
came
to
an
abrupt
halt
faced
claire
and
cried
impulsively
miss
gifford
yes
claire
shrank
instinctively
she
knew
that
she
was
about
to
be
asked
a
question
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
answer
erskine
planted
his
stick
on
the
ground
and
stared
straight
into
her
eyes
why
are
you
so
determined
to
give
me
no
chance
of
meeting
you
again
i
i
determined
i
hope
we
meet
perhaps
next
winter
at
mrs
willoughby
he
laughed
grimly
but
if
i
were
not
content
to
wait
for
next
winter
at
mrs
willoughby
what
then
claire
looked
at
him
gravely
what
would
you
suggest
i
have
no
home
in
london
and
no
relations
and
your
mother
captain
fanshawe
would
not
introduce
me
to
you
when
she
had
the
chance
he
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
oh
my
mother
is
the
most
charming
of
women
and
the
most
indiscreet
she
acts
always
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
she
introduced
you
to
mrs
willoughby
or
asked
mrs
willoughby
to
introduce
herself
which
comes
to
the
same
thing
surely
that
proves
that
she
she
he
broke
off
finding
a
difficulty
in
expressing
what
he
wanted
to
say
but
claire
understood
and
emphatically
disagreed
to
enlist
a
sympathy
was
a
very
different
thing
from
running
the
risk
of
entangling
the
affections
of
an
only
son
obviously
however
she
could
not
advance
this
argument
so
they
stood
the
man
and
the
girl
looking
at
one
another
helpless
irresolute
while
the
clock
opposite
ticked
remorselessly
on
then
with
an
abruptness
which
lent
added
weight
to
his
words
erskine
said
boldly
i
want
to
meet
you
again
i
am
not
content
to
wait
upon
chance
claire
did
not
blush
on
the
contrary
the
colour
faded
from
her
cheeks
most
certainly
she
also
was
not
content
but
she
did
not
waver
in
her
resolution
i
afraid
there
nothing
else
for
it
it
one
of
the
hardships
of
a
working
girl
life
that
she
ca
entertain
or
make
plans
it
seems
more
impossible
to
me
perhaps
from
having
lived
abroad
where
conventions
are
so
strict
english
girls
have
had
more
freedom
i
do
see
what
i
can
do
i
sorry
she
held
out
her
hand
in
farewell
i
hope
some
day
i
see
you
again
quite
suddenly
captain
fanshawe
mood
seemed
to
change
the
set
look
left
his
face
he
smiled
a
bright
confident
smile
there
not
much
fear
about
that
i
shall
take
very
good
care
that
we
do
chapter
seventeen
god
opportunity
after
the
meeting
with
captain
fanshawe
in
the
park
relationship
with
mary
rhodes
sensibly
improved
in
the
first
place
her
own
happiness
made
her
softer
and
more
lenient
in
her
judgment
for
she
deeply
intensely
happy
with
a
happiness
which
all
her
reasonings
were
powerless
to
destroy
my
dear
what
nonsense
she
preached
to
herself
in
elderly
remonstrating
fashion
you
met
the
man
and
he
was
pleased
to
see
you
he
seemed
quite
anxious
to
meet
you
again
perfectly
natural
pray
do
imagine
any
special
meaning
in
you
looked
quite
an
attractive
little
girl
in
your
pretty
blue
dress
and
men
like
to
talk
to
attractive
little
girls
i
dare
say
he
says
just
the
same
to
dozens
of
girls
so
spake
the
inner
voice
but
spoke
in
vain
the
best
things
of
life
are
beyond
reasoning
as
in
religion
reason
leads
us
as
it
were
to
the
very
edge
of
the
rock
of
proven
fact
then
faith
takes
wing
and
soars
above
the
things
of
earth
into
the
great
silence
where
the
soul
communes
with
god
so
in
love
there
comes
to
the
heart
a
sweetness
a
certainty
which
no
reasoning
can
shake
as
erskine
eyes
had
looked
into
hers
in
those
moments
of
farewell
claire
had
realised
that
between
this
man
and
herself
there
existed
a
bond
which
was
stronger
than
spoken
word
so
far
as
she
could
foresee
they
were
hopelessly
divided
by
the
circumstances
of
life
but
in
the
first
dawn
of
love
no
lover
troubles
himself
about
what
the
future
may
bring
the
sweetness
of
the
present
is
claire
was
happy
and
longed
for
every
one
else
to
be
as
happy
as
herself
moreover
her
suspicions
concerning
major
carew
had
been
lulled
to
rest
by
erskine
favourable
pronouncement
personally
she
did
not
like
him
but
this
was
after
all
a
matter
of
taste
she
could
not
approve
his
actions
but
conceivably
there
might
be
explanations
of
which
she
was
unaware
her
manner
to
cecil
regained
its
old
spontaneous
friendliness
and
cecil
responded
with
almost
pathetic
readiness
in
her
ungracious
way
she
had
grown
fond
of
her
pretty
kindly
companion
and
had
missed
the
atmosphere
of
home
which
her
presence
had
given
to
the
saffron
parlour
as
they
sat
over
their
simple
supper
she
would
study
claire
face
with
a
questioning
glance
and
one
night
the
question
found
vent
in
words
you
look
mightily
pleased
with
yourself
young
woman
your
eyes
are
sparkling
as
if
you
were
having
a
firework
exhibition
on
your
own
account
i
never
saw
a
look
so
perky
at
the
end
of
the
summer
term
look
as
if
you
come
into
a
fortune
wish
i
had
sighed
claire
thankful
to
switch
the
conversation
on
to
a
safe
topic
it
would
come
in
most
usefully
at
the
moment
what
are
you
going
to
do
for
the
summer
hols
cecil
is
there
any
possibility
of
no
cecil
said
shortly
and
the
regiment
is
going
into
camp
so
he
will
be
out
of
town
i
not
bothering
my
head
about
holidays
quite
enough
to
do
with
this
wretched
matric
the
head
is
keen
to
make
a
good
show
this
year
for
the
dulwich
school
beat
us
last
year
and
as
usual
all
the
responsibility
and
all
the
blame
is
put
on
the
poor
mistresses
you
ca
make
girls
work
if
they
do
want
you
ca
cram
their
brains
when
they
no
brains
to
cram
but
those
wretched
examiners
send
a
record
of
all
the
marks
so
you
can
see
exactly
where
they
fall
short
woe
betide
the
mistress
who
is
responsible
for
that
branch
i
mind
prophesying
that
if
the
german
does
come
out
better
than
last
year
fraulein
will
be
packed
off
i
would
be
too
sure
of
myself
i
done
all
right
so
far
but
the
head
is
not
as
devoted
to
me
as
she
might
be
i
do
think
she
be
sorry
to
have
an
excuse
for
getting
rid
of
me
that
one
of
the
delightful
aspects
of
our
position
we
are
absolutely
at
the
mercy
of
a
woman
who
from
sheer
force
of
circumstances
becomes
more
of
an
autocrat
every
year
the
committee
listen
to
her
and
accept
every
word
she
says
the
staff
know
better
than
to
dispute
a
single
order
we
stand
on
our
head
in
rows
if
she
made
it
a
rule
the
pupils
scuttle
like
rabbits
when
they
see
her
coming
and
cheer
themselves
hoarse
every
time
she
speaks
no
human
woman
can
live
in
that
atmosphere
for
years
and
keep
a
cool
head
she
rather
a
dear
though
all
the
same
claire
said
loyally
she
had
been
hurt
by
the
lack
of
personal
interest
which
miss
farnborough
showed
in
the
different
members
of
her
staff
but
she
was
unwilling
to
brand
her
as
a
heartless
tyrant
anyway
she
added
hastily
you
are
not
satisfied
here
if
you
were
going
on
teaching
i
should
have
thought
you
be
glad
of
a
change
it
would
be
easy
to
get
another
school
mary
rhodes
looked
at
her
a
long
eloquent
glance
with
a
good
testimonial
yes
without
a
good
testimonial
no
a
testimonial
for
twelve
years
work
depends
on
one
woman
remember
on
her
prejudice
or
good
nature
on
the
mood
in
which
she
happens
to
be
on
one
particular
day
it
might
read
quite
differently
because
she
happened
to
have
a
chill
on
her
liver
my
dear
there
a
sense
of
justice
there
is
such
a
thing
as
honesty
my
dear
i
agree
even
so
would
you
dare
to
say
that
the
wording
of
a
testimonial
would
be
unaffected
by
the
writer
mood
surely
twelve
years
in
one
school
no
it
would
not
necessarily
rhodes
has
been
english
mistress
at
saint
cuthbert
for
twelve
years
of
late
has
been
erratic
in
temper
health
uncertain
examination
records
less
satisfactory
well
if
you
represented
another
school
would
engage
miss
rhodes
claire
was
silent
for
the
first
time
she
realised
the
danger
of
this
power
it
meant
what
might
it
not
mean
it
might
mean
that
the
mistress
who
was
unfortunate
enough
to
incur
the
dislike
of
her
chief
might
be
able
to
procure
another
post
she
might
be
efficient
she
might
be
given
congenial
surroundings
she
might
develop
into
a
treasure
untold
yet
just
because
of
a
depreciating
phrase
in
the
wording
of
a
testimonial
no
chance
would
be
vouchsafed
no
doubt
the
vast
majority
of
head
mistresses
were
women
of
judgment
possessing
a
keen
sense
of
justice
and
responsibility
yet
the
fact
remained
that
a
hasty
impulse
a
little
access
of
temper
in
penning
those
lines
might
mean
the
end
of
a
career
might
mean
poverty
might
mean
ruin
claire
shivered
looked
across
the
table
at
the
thin
fretted
face
and
made
a
hesitating
appeal
cecil
dear
i
know
you
are
a
good
teacher
i
just
love
to
hear
you
talking
over
your
lessons
but
you
irritable
one
of
my
girls
was
crying
the
other
day
you
had
given
so
much
homework
and
she
understand
what
was
to
be
done
and
said
she
dare
ask
you
had
been
cross
i
made
a
guess
at
what
you
wanted
and
by
good
chance
i
was
right
but
if
i
been
wrong
the
poor
thing
would
have
been
in
disgrace
and
honestly
it
was
her
fault
she
was
willing
enough
oh
that
imbecile
gladys
brown
i
know
what
you
mean
i
explained
it
a
hundred
times
if
she
the
brains
of
a
cow
she
have
understood
no
wonder
i
was
cross
i
should
have
been
a
saint
if
i
was
and
no
one
can
be
a
saint
in
the
summer
term
did
did
any
one
else
see
her
cry
i
think
not
no
i
managed
to
comfort
her
but
if
miss
farnborough
had
happened
to
come
in
just
at
that
moment
cecil
shrugged
and
turned
the
subject
but
she
took
the
hint
to
the
benefit
of
her
pupils
during
the
next
few
weeks
july
came
in
and
with
it
a
spell
of
unbearable
heat
in
country
places
and
by
the
seashore
there
was
space
and
air
and
clean
fragrant
surroundings
but
over
london
hung
a
misty
pall
and
not
a
branch
of
the
dusty
trees
quivered
to
the
movement
of
a
passing
breeze
it
was
a
thunderous
unnatural
heat
which
sapped
every
scrap
of
vitality
and
made
every
movement
a
dread
claire
was
horrified
at
the
effect
of
this
heat
wave
on
sophie
blake
in
superficial
fashion
she
had
always
believed
that
rheumatism
must
be
better
in
hot
weather
but
according
to
the
specialist
such
heat
as
this
was
more
trying
than
damp
or
cold
and
sophie
stiffness
increased
with
alarming
suddenness
there
came
a
day
when
by
no
effort
of
will
could
she
get
through
her
classes
when
sheer
necessity
drove
her
to
do
the
thing
she
had
dreaded
most
of
all
inform
the
head
that
she
could
not
go
on
with
her
work
miss
farnborough
was
seated
in
her
private
room
and
listened
with
grave
attention
to
what
the
games
mistress
had
to
say
her
forehead
puckered
in
surprise
as
she
noted
sophie
halting
gait
and
the
while
she
listened
her
keen
brain
was
diving
back
into
the
past
collecting
impressions
she
had
seen
less
than
usual
of
miss
blake
during
the
term
once
or
twice
she
had
received
the
impression
that
miss
blake
avoided
her
approach
miss
blake
had
been
looking
pale
she
waited
until
sophie
had
finished
speaking
her
hands
folded
on
her
knee
her
penetrating
eye
fixed
on
the
girl
face
then
she
spoke
i
am
sorry
to
hear
this
miss
blake
your
work
has
been
excellent
hitherto
but
rheumatism
is
a
serious
handicap
you
say
that
this
heat
is
responsible
for
the
present
attack
am
i
to
understand
that
it
is
a
first
attack
that
you
have
had
no
threatening
before
i
have
been
rheumatic
all
winter
more
or
less
before
the
easter
holidays
it
was
pretty
bad
i
began
to
feel
stiff
miss
farnborough
repeated
the
word
gravely
stiff
that
was
bad
that
was
very
bad
how
could
you
take
your
classes
if
you
were
feeling
stiff
i
managed
somehow
sophie
said
for
a
moment
she
had
imagined
that
the
head
mistress
concern
had
been
on
her
account
she
believed
it
no
longer
when
she
saw
the
flash
of
indignation
which
lighted
the
grey
eyes
managed
and
you
went
on
in
that
fashion
you
were
content
to
go
on
no
i
was
not
content
i
was
very
far
from
content
i
suffered
horrible
pain
i
went
to
a
specialist
and
paid
him
two
guineas
for
his
advice
since
then
i
have
paid
twenty
pounds
for
treatment
on
miss
farnborough
face
the
disapproval
grew
more
and
more
pronounced
miss
blake
i
am
afraid
you
have
not
been
quite
straightforward
in
this
matter
it
appears
that
you
have
been
ill
for
months
with
an
illness
which
must
necessarily
have
interfered
with
your
work
and
this
is
the
first
time
i
hear
about
it
i
am
head
mistress
of
this
school
if
anything
is
wrong
with
a
member
of
the
staff
it
is
her
first
duty
to
come
to
me
you
tell
me
now
that
you
have
been
ill
for
three
months
since
before
the
last
holidays
and
acknowledge
that
you
can
go
on
no
longer
in
ten
days
we
break
up
i
ask
you
to
allow
me
ten
extra
days
the
weather
is
so
hot
that
the
girls
would
be
thankful
to
escape
the
exercises
by
the
end
of
the
holidays
i
hope
to
be
quite
better
the
easter
holidays
do
not
seem
to
have
done
you
much
good
miss
farnborough
said
cruelly
then
seeing
the
girl
flush
she
added
of
course
you
shall
have
your
ten
days
i
can
see
that
you
are
unfit
for
work
and
we
must
manage
without
you
till
the
end
of
the
term
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
miss
blake
very
sorry
indeed
it
is
very
trying
and
upsetting
and
and
expensive
into
the
bargain
twenty
pounds
did
you
say
that
is
surely
a
great
deal
have
you
tried
the
shilling
bottles
of
gout
and
rheumatic
pills
i
have
been
told
they
are
quite
excellent
but
i
must
repeat
that
you
have
been
wrong
in
not
coming
to
me
sooner
as
a
pure
matter
of
honesty
do
you
think
that
you
were
justified
in
continuing
to
take
classes
for
which
you
were
unfit
the
tears
started
to
sophie
eyes
she
lowered
her
lids
to
hide
them
from
sight
the
girls
did
not
suffer
she
said
deeply
i
did
the
suffering
miss
farnborough
moved
impatiently
she
was
intensely
practical
and
and
with
all
her
heart
hated
any
approach
to
sentiment
you
suffered
you
were
unfit
she
repeated
coldly
and
your
obvious
duty
was
to
come
to
me
you
must
have
known
that
under
the
circumstances
i
should
not
have
wished
you
to
continue
the
classes
sophie
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
she
said
very
quietly
very
deliberately
yes
i
did
know
but
i
also
knew
that
if
i
could
nerve
myself
to
bear
the
pain
and
the
fatigue
i
train
the
girls
as
well
as
ever
and
i
knew
too
that
if
you
sent
me
away
in
the
middle
of
term
you
would
be
less
likely
to
take
me
back
it
means
everything
to
me
you
see
what
would
happen
to
me
if
i
were
permanently
invalided
without
a
pension
at
you
have
been
paid
a
good
salary
miss
blake
an
exceptionally
good
salary
because
it
is
realised
that
your
work
is
especially
wearing
you
ought
to
have
saved
if
i
had
had
no
home
claims
i
might
have
been
able
to
save
one
or
two
hundred
pounds
not
a
very
big
life
provision
as
it
happens
however
i
have
given
thirty
pounds
a
year
towards
the
education
of
a
young
sister
and
it
has
been
impossible
to
save
at
all
but
now
of
course
your
sister
will
help
miss
farnborough
said
and
turned
briskly
to
another
topic
you
said
that
you
have
been
to
a
specialist
will
you
give
me
his
address
i
should
like
to
communicate
with
him
direct
you
understand
miss
blake
that
if
this
stiffness
continues
it
will
be
impossible
for
you
to
continue
your
duties
here
quite
impossible
faltered
sophie
in
low
tones
miss
farnborough
pushed
back
her
chair
and
rose
to
her
feet
but
one
hopes
of
course
that
all
may
go
well
i
have
never
had
any
complaint
to
make
with
respect
to
your
work
you
have
been
very
successful
very
popular
with
the
girls
i
should
be
sorry
to
lose
you
be
sure
to
let
me
know
how
you
go
on
perhaps
i
had
better
be
guided
by
dr
blank
i
should
try
the
pills
i
think
they
are
worth
trying
and
avoid
the
sea
sea
air
is
bad
for
rheumatism
try
some
high
inland
place
we
had
better
say
now
i
suppose
as
you
will
not
come
back
after
my
dear
let
me
hear
soon
all
good
wishes
for
your
recovery
sophie
left
the
room
and
made
her
way
upstairs
to
the
she
moved
very
slowly
partly
because
every
movement
was
an
effort
partly
because
the
familiar
objects
on
which
her
eyes
rested
became
suddenly
instinct
with
new
interest
for
ten
long
working
years
she
had
passed
them
daily
with
indifference
but
this
afternoon
it
was
borne
in
upon
her
that
she
would
never
see
them
again
and
the
conviction
brought
with
it
a
bitter
pang
after
all
they
had
been
happy
years
spent
in
a
bustle
of
youthful
life
and
energy
in
an
atmosphere
of
affection
too
for
the
girls
were
and
the
gym
mistress
had
been
universally
popular
even
as
the
thought
passed
through
sophie
mind
one
of
her
special
adorers
appeared
suddenly
at
the
far
end
of
the
corridor
and
hurried
forward
to
meet
her
miss
blake
darling
you
look
so
white
are
you
faint
take
my
arm
lean
on
me
were
you
going
to
lie
down
i
going
to
the
i
can
manage
myself
but
gladys
find
miss
gifford
and
ask
her
to
come
to
me
as
soon
as
she
is
free
tell
her
i
not
well
you
a
dear
girl
gladys
thank
you
for
being
so
kind
to
me
all
these
years
gladys
rolled
adoring
blue
eyes
and
sped
on
her
mission
the
next
morning
she
realised
that
those
thanks
had
been
darling
miss
farewell
and
shed
bitter
tears
but
for
the
moment
she
was
filled
with
complaisance
claire
appeared
in
due
time
heard
what
had
happened
and
helped
sophie
to
collect
her
various
small
belongings
the
other
teachers
had
already
dispersed
so
the
ordeal
of
was
avoided
you
can
explain
when
you
meet
them
next
term
said
claire
i
can
write
my
corrected
sophie
she
blinked
away
a
few
tears
and
said
piteously
not
much
chance
for
me
if
she
consults
dr
blank
he
as
much
discouraged
as
i
am
myself
what
do
you
suppose
he
will
advise
now
i
suppose
i
have
to
see
him
and
lie
awake
all
wondering
what
he
will
say
we
do
better
than
that
we
call
this
very
afternoon
if
he
is
in
i
sure
he
will
see
us
and
a
day
saved
is
a
day
gained
i
get
a
taxi
another
taxi
i
ruining
you
claire
how
i
do
hate
sponging
on
other
people
would
you
do
it
for
me
if
things
were
reversed
of
course
i
should
but
it
so
much
more
agreeable
to
help
than
to
be
helped
it
ignoble
i
suppose
but
i
do
hate
to
feel
grateful
well
no
one
could
by
any
possibility
call
you
my
dear
is
that
any
consolation
cried
claire
mischievously
and
sophie
was
surprised
into
the
travesty
of
a
smile
dr
blank
was
at
home
and
listened
to
what
sophie
had
to
tell
him
with
grave
attention
he
expressed
satisfaction
to
hear
that
her
holidays
had
begun
but
when
questioned
as
to
his
probable
report
to
miss
farnborough
had
no
consolation
to
offer
i
am
afraid
i
must
tell
you
honestly
that
you
are
not
fit
for
the
work
of
course
it
is
quite
possible
that
there
may
be
a
great
improvement
by
september
but
even
so
you
would
be
retarding
your
recovery
by
going
on
with
such
exhausting
work
you
must
try
to
find
something
lighter
sophie
laughed
and
her
laugh
was
not
good
to
hear
claire
said
firmly
she
find
it
i
will
find
it
for
her
there
no
need
to
worry
about
september
what
we
want
to
know
is
what
she
is
to
do
morrow
for
the
rest
of
the
holidays
i
ca
afford
any
more
injections
they
done
me
no
good
and
they
cost
too
much
i
ca
afford
any
more
treatments
i
can
only
take
medicines
if
you
will
give
me
some
medicines
dr
blank
sat
silent
tapping
his
desk
with
noiseless
fingers
staring
thoughtfully
across
the
room
it
was
evident
that
he
had
a
proposition
to
make
evident
also
that
he
doubted
its
reception
the
best
thing
under
the
circumstances
the
wisest
thing
he
said
slowly
at
last
would
be
for
you
to
go
into
hospital
as
an
ordinary
patient
i
could
get
you
a
bed
in
one
of
my
own
wards
where
i
could
look
after
you
myself
in
consultation
with
the
first
men
in
town
you
could
have
massage
electricity
radium
heat
baths
every
appliance
that
could
possibly
be
of
use
and
you
could
stay
on
long
enough
to
give
them
a
chance
it
would
be
an
ordinary
ward
remember
an
ordinary
bed
in
an
ordinary
ward
and
your
neighbours
would
not
be
up
to
newnham
standard
you
would
be
awakened
at
five
in
the
morning
and
settled
for
the
night
at
eight
you
would
have
to
obey
rules
which
would
seem
to
you
unnecessary
and
tiresome
you
would
be
i
am
afraid
profoundly
bored
on
the
other
hand
you
would
have
every
attention
that
skill
and
science
can
devise
you
would
not
have
to
pay
a
penny
and
you
would
have
a
better
chance
than
a
duchess
in
a
ducal
palace
think
it
over
and
let
me
know
if
you
decide
to
go
i
manage
the
rest
take
a
day
a
couple
of
days
i
wo
take
two
minutes
thank
you
i
decide
now
i
go
of
course
and
thank
you
very
much
dr
blank
beamed
with
satisfaction
sensible
girl
sensible
girl
that
right
that
right
very
good
you
are
doing
the
right
thing
and
we
all
do
our
best
for
you
and
your
friend
here
will
come
to
see
you
and
help
to
make
the
time
pass
interesting
study
you
know
valuable
opportunity
of
studying
character
if
you
look
at
it
in
that
light
why
not
turn
it
into
literary
capital
from
a
hospital
bed
neighbours
in
b
ward
might
make
an
uncommonly
good
series
who
knows
we
may
have
you
turning
out
quite
a
literary
star
sophie
smiled
faintly
being
one
of
the
people
who
would
rather
walk
five
miles
than
write
the
shortest
letter
many
unexpected
things
happen
in
this
world
but
it
was
certain
that
her
own
rise
to
literary
eminence
would
never
swell
the
number
but
she
knew
that
dr
blank
was
trying
to
cheer
her
so
she
kept
that
certainty
to
herself
the
two
girls
made
their
way
back
to
sophie
lodgings
and
discussed
the
situation
over
the
tea
i
shall
have
to
give
my
landlady
notice
sophie
said
looking
wistfully
round
the
little
room
which
had
been
so
truly
a
home
if
to
be
in
hospital
for
many
weeks
it
folly
to
go
on
paying
the
rent
and
in
any
case
i
ca
afford
so
much
now
one
ca
have
bills
and
other
luxuries
as
well
what
shall
i
have
to
take
into
hospital
will
they
allow
me
to
wear
my
own
things
i
do
think
i
get
better
in
a
calico
pretty
frills
and
a
blue
ribbon
bow
are
as
good
as
a
tonic
but
will
the
authorities
permit
have
you
ever
seen
ribbon
bows
in
a
hospital
bed
i
have
had
much
experience
but
i
should
think
they
would
be
encouraged
as
a
ward
decoration
i
hope
so
i
sure
for
i
mean
to
present
you
with
a
duck
of
a
oh
nothing
more
claire
do
give
me
anything
more
i
shall
never
be
able
to
pay
you
back
cried
sophie
then
in
a
voice
of
poignant
suffering
she
cried
sharply
oh
claire
my
little
sister
is
to
become
of
my
little
sister
if
i
am
not
able
to
help
if
i
need
to
be
helped
myself
her
education
will
be
interrupted
for
it
will
be
impossible
to
go
on
paying
oh
it
too
hard
too
dreadful
everything
seems
so
hopeless
and
black
yes
it
does
the
way
seems
blocked
one
ca
see
a
step
ahead
sophie
cried
claire
deeply
and
at
that
a
gleam
of
light
came
into
sophie
eyes
yes
yes
that
just
what
it
is
thanks
for
reminding
me
sophie
leant
back
in
her
chair
staring
dreamily
into
space
till
presently
something
of
the
old
bright
look
came
back
to
her
face
and
that
she
said
softly
that
the
kind
of
help
it
is
sweet
to
accept
chapter
eighteen
an
invitation
with
sophie
in
hospital
pathetically
anxious
for
visits
with
the
rent
of
the
laburnum
road
lodgings
to
pay
whether
one
lived
in
them
or
not
claire
nerved
herself
to
spend
august
in
town
with
the
prospect
of
a
september
holiday
to
cheer
her
spirits
through
one
of
the
other
mistresses
she
had
heard
of
an
ideal
farmhouse
near
the
sea
where
the
kindly
housewife
mothered
her
guests
with
affectionate
care
where
food
was
abundant
and
cream
appeared
upon
the
table
at
every
meal
thick
yellow
country
cream
in
which
a
spoon
would
stand
upright
there
was
also
a
hammock
swung
between
two
in
the
orchard
a
balcony
outside
the
bedroom
window
and
a
shabby
with
a
pony
who
could
really
go
what
could
one
wish
for
more
claire
planned
a
lazy
month
lying
in
that
hammock
reading
stories
about
other
people
and
dreaming
still
more
thrilling
romances
about
herself
driving
the
pony
along
country
lanes
going
out
on
to
the
balcony
in
the
early
morning
to
breathe
the
scent
of
honeysuckle
and
sweetbriar
and
lemon
thyme
and
all
the
dear
treasures
to
be
found
in
the
gardens
of
farmhouses
she
had
a
craving
for
flowers
in
these
hot
summer
days
not
the
meagre
sixpennyworth
which
adorned
the
saffron
parlour
but
a
wealth
of
blossom
bought
without
consideration
of
cost
and
one
day
with
the
unexpectedness
of
a
fairy
gift
her
wish
was
fulfilled
it
lay
on
the
table
when
she
returned
from
school
a
long
cardboard
box
bearing
the
name
of
a
celebrated
west
end
florist
the
word
fragile
marked
on
the
lid
and
inside
were
roses
magnificent
roses
with
the
dew
still
on
their
leaves
the
fat
green
stalks
nearly
a
yard
in
length
dozens
of
roses
of
every
colour
and
shade
from
the
lustrous
whiteness
of
frau
carl
to
the
purple
blackness
of
prince
camille
claire
gathered
them
in
her
arms
unconscious
of
the
charming
picture
which
she
made
in
her
simple
blue
lawn
dress
with
her
glowing
face
rising
over
the
riot
of
colour
gathered
them
in
a
great
handful
and
ran
swiftly
upstairs
there
was
no
card
inside
the
box
no
message
of
any
kind
but
her
heart
knew
no
doubt
as
to
the
sender
and
she
dare
not
face
the
fire
of
mary
rhodes
in
the
days
of
daffodils
she
had
treated
herself
to
a
high
green
column
of
a
vase
which
was
an
ideal
receptacle
for
the
present
treasures
when
it
was
filled
there
were
still
nearly
half
the
number
waiting
for
a
home
so
these
were
plunged
deep
into
the
ewer
until
the
morrow
when
they
would
be
taken
to
sophie
in
hospital
the
little
room
was
filled
with
beauty
and
fragrance
and
claire
knew
moments
of
unclouded
happiness
as
she
looked
around
presently
she
extracted
two
roses
from
the
rest
ran
downstairs
to
collect
box
paper
and
string
and
handed
rubbish
and
roses
together
to
lizzie
at
the
top
of
the
kitchen
stairs
lizzie
received
her
share
of
the
treasures
with
dignity
cut
off
the
giant
stems
which
she
considered
straggly
and
out
of
place
and
crammed
the
two
heads
into
a
brown
the
which
she
deposited
on
a
sunny
claire
saw
them
as
she
next
left
the
house
and
shrugged
resignedly
for
she
was
beginning
to
learn
the
lesson
which
many
of
us
take
a
lifetime
to
master
the
wisdom
of
allowing
people
to
enjoy
themselves
in
their
own
fashion
the
willoughbys
were
leaving
town
in
mid
july
for
switzerland
and
later
on
for
a
scottish
claire
received
an
invitation
to
tea
on
their
last
saturday
afternoon
and
arrived
to
find
the
full
of
visitors
malcolm
heward
was
assisting
janet
at
the
but
with
this
exception
she
recognised
no
one
in
the
room
and
was
thankful
for
the
attentions
of
master
reginald
who
hailed
her
as
an
old
acquaintance
and
reproached
her
loudly
for
not
turning
up
at
lord
i
looked
out
for
you
you
know
he
said
impressively
and
claire
was
the
more
gratified
by
his
remembrance
because
malcolm
heward
had
required
a
second
introduction
to
awaken
his
recollection
it
is
no
doubt
gratifying
to
the
object
of
his
devotion
when
a
man
remains
blind
to
every
other
member
of
her
sex
but
the
other
members
may
feel
a
natural
objection
to
be
so
ignored
claire
was
annoyed
by
the
necessity
of
that
second
introduction
and
as
a
consequence
made
herself
so
fascinating
to
the
boy
who
remembered
that
he
hugged
the
sweet
delusion
that
she
considered
him
a
man
and
was
seriously
smitten
by
his
charms
he
waited
upon
her
with
assiduity
gave
her
exclusive
tips
as
to
her
choice
of
cakes
and
recited
the
latest
funny
stories
which
were
already
stale
in
his
own
circles
but
which
came
to
her
ears
with
agreeable
freshness
it
was
while
the
two
were
laughing
together
over
an
unexpected
that
the
departure
of
two
guests
left
a
space
across
which
claire
could
see
a
far
corner
of
the
room
and
perceived
that
a
lady
seated
on
a
sofa
had
raised
a
to
stare
across
at
herself
she
was
an
elderly
lady
and
at
first
sight
her
appearance
awoke
no
recollection
she
was
just
a
woman
attired
in
handsome
black
in
no
way
differentiated
from
one
or
two
other
visitors
of
the
same
age
even
when
the
dropped
to
her
side
disclosing
a
pair
of
very
bright
very
quizzical
grey
eyes
it
was
a
full
moment
before
claire
realised
that
this
was
her
acquaintance
of
that
first
eventful
journey
to
london
none
other
than
mrs
fanshawe
herself
there
she
sat
smiling
complacent
as
ever
nodding
with
an
air
of
mingled
friendliness
and
patronage
laying
one
hand
on
the
vacant
place
by
her
side
with
an
action
which
was
obviously
significant
claire
chose
however
to
ignore
the
invitation
and
after
a
grave
bow
of
acknowledgment
turned
back
to
reginald
keeping
her
eyes
resolutely
averted
from
that
far
corner
it
was
mrs
fanshawe
herself
who
was
finally
compelled
to
cross
the
room
to
make
her
greetings
miss
gifford
surely
it
is
miss
gifford
mrs
willoughby
told
me
she
expected
you
this
afternoon
and
how
are
you
my
dear
after
this
long
time
the
tone
was
all
that
was
cordial
and
friendly
claire
stood
up
tall
and
stately
and
extended
a
perfectly
gloved
hand
it
was
not
in
human
nature
to
be
perfectly
natural
at
that
moment
she
was
aware
that
as
the
americans
would
express
it
she
was
putting
on
frills
she
was
amused
at
the
artificiality
of
her
own
voice
quite
well
thank
you
exceedingly
flourishing
you
look
it
mrs
fanshawe
said
and
seated
herself
ruthlessly
in
reginald
chair
tell
me
all
about
it
you
were
going
to
work
were
you
some
idea
of
being
independent
so
ridiculous
for
a
pretty
girl
and
you
had
how
long
nearly
a
year
got
tired
of
it
yet
by
any
chance
oh
yes
quite
often
i
feel
very
tired
but
i
should
have
felt
the
same
about
pleasuring
and
work
is
more
worth
while
it
has
been
very
interesting
i
have
learnt
a
great
deal
more
than
the
pupils
hey
chuckled
mrs
fanshawe
shrewdly
try
to
pretend
that
you
are
a
model
i
know
better
i
knew
you
were
not
the
type
when
i
saw
you
on
that
journey
and
after
a
year
trial
you
are
less
the
type
than
ever
she
screwed
up
her
eyes
and
looked
claire
over
with
deliberate
criticism
up
and
down
down
and
up
no
my
dear
nature
did
intend
you
to
be
shut
up
in
a
girls
school
suddenly
she
swerved
to
another
topic
what
a
journey
that
was
i
nearly
expired
if
it
had
been
for
you
i
should
never
have
survived
i
told
my
son
you
had
saved
my
life
that
was
my
son
who
met
me
on
the
platform
was
it
fancy
that
an
expression
of
watchfulness
had
come
into
the
gay
eyes
claire
imagined
that
she
recognised
such
an
expression
but
being
prepared
for
some
such
reference
had
herself
well
in
command
not
a
nicker
of
embarrassment
passed
over
her
face
as
she
said
quietly
yes
i
knew
it
was
your
son
i
met
captain
fanshawe
here
one
evening
last
winter
so
i
have
been
introduced
mrs
fanshawe
waved
her
and
murmured
some
vague
words
which
might
or
might
not
have
been
intended
as
an
apology
oh
yes
so
nice
naturally
that
morning
i
was
i
did
not
know
what
i
was
doing
i
crawled
into
bed
erskine
told
me
about
meeting
you
and
of
your
pretty
performance
quite
a
professional
more
amusing
than
school
teaching
i
should
say
more
profitable
you
ought
to
think
of
it
as
a
profession
erskine
was
quite
pleased
he
comes
here
a
great
deal
of
course
mrs
fanshawe
smile
deepened
in
meaning
fashion
then
suddenly
she
sighed
very
delightful
for
them
of
course
but
i
see
nothing
of
him
we
mothers
of
modern
children
have
a
lonely
time
i
used
to
wish
for
a
daughter
but
perhaps
if
i
had
one
would
have
developed
a
fancy
to
fly
off
to
india
that
was
a
hit
at
claire
but
she
received
it
in
silence
being
a
little
touched
by
the
unaffected
note
of
wistfulness
in
the
other
voice
as
she
regretted
her
lonely
estate
it
hard
to
be
a
widow
and
to
see
so
little
of
an
only
child
especially
if
that
only
child
happened
to
be
so
altogether
charming
and
attractive
mrs
fanshawe
glanced
across
at
the
where
janet
and
her
cavalier
were
still
busy
ministering
to
the
needs
of
fresh
arrivals
i
asked
janet
willoughby
to
take
pity
on
me
for
a
few
weeks
this
summer
but
she
too
full
up
with
her
own
plans
says
so
at
least
but
i
dare
say
it
would
have
been
different
if
well
well
i
have
been
young
myself
and
i
dare
say
i
should
have
been
too
keen
to
accept
an
invitation
to
stay
in
the
country
with
only
an
old
woman
as
companion
enjoy
yourself
while
you
are
young
my
dear
it
gets
more
and
more
difficult
with
every
year
you
live
claire
made
a
protesting
grimace
does
it
that
discouraging
i
always
flattered
myself
that
it
would
grow
easier
when
one
is
young
everything
is
vague
and
unsettled
and
naturally
one
feels
anxious
about
what
is
to
happen
next
it
is
almost
impossible
to
be
philosophical
about
the
unknown
but
when
your
life
has
shaped
itself
it
ought
to
be
easy
to
settle
down
and
make
the
best
of
it
and
cultivate
an
easy
mind
mrs
fanshawe
laughed
well
reasoned
my
dear
well
reasoned
most
logical
and
sound
and
just
as
futile
in
practice
as
logical
things
usually
are
you
believe
me
if
i
told
you
that
it
is
the
very
uncertainty
which
makes
the
charm
of
youth
or
that
being
certain
is
the
bane
of
old
age
but
the
truth
all
the
same
and
when
you
are
sixty
you
will
have
discovered
it
for
yourself
well
so
my
letter
to
mrs
willoughby
was
of
some
use
after
all
she
did
send
you
a
card
claire
looked
across
the
room
to
where
mrs
willoughby
sat
worship
is
an
instinct
in
hearts
which
are
still
fired
with
enthusiasm
and
this
stout
woman
was
claire
heroine
she
was
and
to
be
kind
is
in
good
truth
the
fulfilment
of
christ
law
among
claire
favourite
books
was
professor
drummond
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
with
its
wonderful
exposition
of
the
thirteenth
chapter
of
corinthians
when
she
read
its
pages
her
thoughts
flew
instinctively
to
this
rich
woman
of
society
who
was
not
puffed
up
thought
no
evil
was
not
easily
provoked
suffered
long
was
the
girl
eyes
were
eloquent
with
love
and
admiration
as
they
rested
on
the
plain
elderly
face
and
the
woman
who
was
watching
felt
a
stab
of
envy
at
the
sight
the
old
crave
for
the
love
of
the
young
and
cherish
it
when
found
as
one
of
their
dearest
possessions
and
despite
the
natural
gaiety
of
her
disposition
there
were
moments
when
mrs
fanshawe
felt
the
burden
of
loneliness
press
heavily
upon
her
she
has
done
much
more
than
send
me
a
card
claire
said
deeply
she
has
been
a
friend
she
has
taken
away
the
terrible
feeling
of
loneliness
if
i
were
in
trouble
or
needed
any
help
i
that
she
would
give
it
oh
yes
yes
naturally
she
would
so
would
any
one
my
dear
who
had
the
chance
but
she
a
good
creature
of
course
a
dear
creature
devoted
to
her
and
to
janet
janet
and
i
are
the
best
of
friends
again
the
meaning
look
the
meaning
tone
and
again
in
claire
heart
the
same
sweet
sense
of
certainty
mingled
with
a
tender
compassion
for
janet
who
was
less
fortunate
than
herself
it
was
a
help
to
look
across
at
the
and
to
realise
that
consolation
was
waiting
for
janet
if
she
chose
to
take
it
suddenly
mrs
fanshawe
switched
off
on
to
yet
another
topic
and
where
are
you
going
to
spend
your
summer
holidays
my
dear
in
september
i
am
probably
going
to
a
farmhouse
near
the
sea
and
in
august
in
town
i
think
i
have
an
invalid
friend
mrs
fanshawe
swept
aside
the
suggestion
with
an
imperious
hand
nonsense
utter
nonsense
stays
in
town
in
august
my
good
child
the
thing
impossible
i
passed
through
once
or
twice
for
country
visits
and
it
an
unknown
place
the
wierdest
people
walking
up
and
down
where
they
come
from
i
ca
conceive
but
you
never
saw
anything
more
impossible
and
the
shops
i
knew
a
poor
girl
who
became
engaged
at
the
end
of
july
and
had
to
get
her
trousseau
at
once
as
they
sailed
in
september
she
was
in
despair
to
be
had
she
was
positively
in
tears
i
shall
get
engaged
in
june
claire
said
firmly
and
take
advantage
of
the
summer
sales
i
call
it
most
thoughtless
of
him
to
have
waited
till
the
end
of
july
but
mrs
fanshawe
was
not
attending
her
eyes
had
brightened
with
a
sudden
thought
she
was
saying
to
herself
why
not
i
should
be
alone
there
would
be
no
danger
of
complications
and
the
child
would
be
a
delightful
companion
good
to
look
at
plenty
to
say
for
herself
and
a
mind
of
her
own
quite
useful
in
entertaining
too
i
could
play
off
some
of
my
duty
debts
and
she
could
whistle
to
us
after
dinner
quite
a
novelty
in
the
country
it
would
be
quite
a
draw
a
capital
idea
i
say
a
week
and
if
it
works
she
can
stay
on
no
my
dear
you
can
not
possibly
endure
town
in
august
at
least
not
the
entire
month
run
down
to
me
for
a
break
quite
a
short
journey
an
hour
and
a
half
from
waterloo
and
the
air
is
delightfully
fresh
i
shall
be
alone
so
i
ca
offer
you
any
excitement
but
if
you
are
fond
of
motoring
the
blood
rushed
into
claire
face
she
was
so
intensely
overpoweringly
surprised
that
for
the
moment
all
other
feelings
were
in
abeyance
the
last
thing
in
the
world
which
she
had
expected
was
that
erskine
mother
should
invite
her
to
visit
her
home
i
do
know
if
you
care
for
gardening
i
mad
about
it
myself
my
garden
is
a
child
to
me
i
stand
no
interference
the
gardeners
are
paid
to
obey
me
and
carry
out
my
instructions
if
they
get
upsetting
off
they
go
you
like
my
garden
it
is
not
cut
out
to
a
regulation
pattern
it
has
a
personality
of
its
own
i
have
all
my
meals
on
the
verandah
in
summer
we
could
get
you
some
tennis
too
you
would
be
buried
alive
well
what
do
you
say
is
it
worth
while
it
exceedingly
kind
it
awfully
good
of
you
i
i
am
so
completely
taken
by
surprise
that
i
hardly
know
i
shall
have
to
think
nonsense
my
dear
what
is
there
to
think
about
you
have
no
other
engagement
and
you
need
a
change
incidentally
also
want
a
companion
you
would
be
doing
me
a
good
turn
as
well
as
yourself
sure
your
mother
would
wish
it
no
doubt
about
that
claire
smiled
to
herself
as
she
realised
how
mrs
judge
would
rejoice
over
the
visit
turning
one
swallow
into
a
summer
and
in
imagination
beholding
her
daughter
plunged
into
a
very
vortex
of
gaiety
she
was
still
smiling
still
considering
when
janet
came
strolling
across
the
room
and
laid
her
hand
affectionately
on
mrs
fanshawe
shoulder
i
have
had
a
word
with
you
all
afternoon
such
a
rush
of
people
you
had
tea
comfortably
i
hope
and
you
too
claire
there
was
just
a
suspicion
of
hesitation
before
the
christian
name
i
have
just
been
asking
miss
gifford
to
take
pity
on
my
loneliness
for
part
of
august
she
is
not
in
engagements
as
you
are
my
dear
and
that
precious
son
of
mine
so
we
are
going
to
amuse
each
other
and
see
how
much
entertainment
we
can
squeeze
out
of
the
countryside
but
i
have
i
did
i
not
sure
stammered
claire
acutely
conscious
of
the
hardening
of
janet
face
but
once
again
mrs
fanshawe
waved
aside
her
objections
but
am
sure
it
all
settled
my
dear
all
but
the
day
put
your
address
on
this
silly
little
tablet
and
i
write
as
soon
as
looked
over
my
dates
now
janet
i
ready
for
a
chat
take
me
out
to
the
balcony
away
from
this
crowd
and
i
must
go
i
think
i
say
claire
held
out
her
hand
to
the
daughter
of
the
house
i
hope
you
may
have
a
delightful
summer
oh
thanks
so
much
oh
yes
yes
i
quite
sure
i
will
janet
answered
mechanically
she
touched
claire
hand
with
her
fingers
and
turned
hastily
aside
chapter
nineteen
erskine
fanshawe
home
claire
dreaded
mary
rhodes
curiosity
on
the
subject
of
her
proposed
visit
but
in
effect
there
was
none
forthcoming
cecil
was
too
much
engrossed
in
her
own
affairs
to
feel
anything
but
a
passing
interest
some
one
you
met
at
the
willoughbys
only
the
old
lady
rather
you
than
me
nice
house
though
i
suppose
gardens
motors
that
kind
of
thing
dull
but
luxurious
perhaps
you
stay
on
permanently
as
her
companion
that
claire
said
emphatically
will
never
happen
i
was
thinking
of
clothes
i
am
quite
for
evenings
and
i
can
manage
for
afternoons
but
i
do
think
i
ought
to
indulge
in
one
or
two
bargains
for
morning
wear
i
saw
some
particularly
drastic
specimens
in
knightsbridge
this
week
cecil
could
you
i
hate
asking
but
you
pay
me
back
cecil
stare
of
amazement
was
almost
comical
under
the
circumstances
my
good
girl
i
was
really
pondering
whether
i
dare
i
horribly
hard
up
and
that
the
truth
i
had
calls
not
major
carew
again
i
ca
understand
it
cecil
you
know
i
inquired
about
him
you
told
me
to
ask
if
i
had
a
chance
and
his
father
rich
he
might
fly
into
a
rage
if
he
were
asked
for
money
but
he
would
give
it
in
the
end
major
carew
might
have
a
bad
but
what
is
that
compared
with
borrowing
from
you
and
from
a
man
point
of
view
it
so
little
such
very
small
sums
she
caught
a
change
of
expression
on
the
other
face
and
leapt
at
its
meaning
cecil
you
have
been
giving
more
your
savings
and
if
i
have
claire
gifford
what
business
is
it
of
yours
what
was
i
saving
for
to
provide
for
my
old
age
was
it
and
now
that
the
need
has
gone
why
should
i
lend
it
if
i
chose
frank
happens
to
be
hard
up
for
a
few
months
and
besides
there
a
reason
we
are
getting
tired
of
waiting
you
must
never
never
breathe
a
word
to
a
soul
but
he
wants
me
he
thinks
it
might
be
better
claire
stared
with
wide
eyes
cecil
frowned
and
finished
the
sentence
in
reckless
tones
we
shall
probably
get
married
this
autumn
and
tell
his
father
afterwards
oh
cecil
no
do
do
it
it
madness
it
folly
he
ought
not
to
ask
you
it
will
make
things
fifty
times
more
difficult
it
would
make
things
mary
rhodes
said
the
words
were
such
an
unconscious
revelation
of
her
inner
attitude
towards
her
lover
that
claire
was
smitten
with
a
very
passion
of
pity
she
stretched
out
her
hand
and
cried
ardently
cecil
i
am
thinking
of
your
happiness
i
long
for
you
to
be
sure
but
a
private
marriage
is
an
insult
to
a
girl
it
puts
her
into
a
wrong
position
and
no
man
has
the
right
to
suggest
it
where
is
your
pride
oh
my
dear
interrupted
cecil
wearily
i
past
worrying
about
pride
i
and
look
older
and
feel
sixty
at
the
least
i
tired
out
in
body
and
soul
i
sick
of
this
empty
life
i
want
a
home
i
want
rest
i
want
some
one
to
care
for
me
and
take
an
interest
in
what
i
do
frank
is
perfect
i
do
pretend
that
he
is
i
wish
to
goodness
he
own
up
and
face
the
racket
once
for
all
but
it
no
use
he
wo
between
ourselves
i
believe
he
thinks
the
old
man
wo
live
much
longer
and
there
will
be
no
need
to
worry
him
at
all
any
way
there
it
is
he
wo
tell
at
present
however
much
i
may
beg
but
he
will
marry
me
he
wants
to
be
married
in
september
and
that
proves
that
he
care
he
is
looking
out
for
a
flat
and
picking
up
furniture
are
picking
up
furniture
cecil
corrected
herself
hastily
i
go
in
and
ask
the
prices
and
he
sends
his
servants
the
next
week
to
do
the
bargaining
and
there
will
be
my
clothes
too
i
pay
you
back
in
time
claire
with
ten
per
cent
interest
into
the
bargain
and
perhaps
when
i
a
rich
woman
the
time
may
come
when
you
will
be
glad
to
borrow
from
me
the
prospect
was
not
cheering
but
the
intention
was
good
and
as
such
had
to
be
suitably
acknowledged
claire
adjourned
upstairs
to
consult
her
and
decided
bravely
that
the
drastic
bargains
could
not
be
afforded
then
being
a
very
human
and
feminine
young
woman
she
told
herself
that
there
could
be
no
harm
in
going
to
look
at
the
dresses
once
more
just
to
convince
herself
that
they
were
not
so
very
drastic
after
all
and
lo
close
inspection
proved
them
even
more
drastic
than
she
had
believed
and
by
the
evening
delivery
a
choice
specimen
was
speeding
by
motor
van
to
laburnum
road
on
visiting
days
claire
went
regularly
to
visit
sophie
who
by
her
own
account
was
being
treated
to
seventeen
different
cures
at
the
same
time
and
was
too
busy
being
rubbed
and
boiled
and
electrified
and
dosed
and
put
to
bed
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
and
awakened
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
have
any
time
to
feel
bored
she
took
a
keen
interest
also
in
her
fellow
patients
and
was
the
confidante
of
many
tragic
stories
which
made
her
own
lot
seem
light
in
comparison
altogether
she
was
more
cheerful
and
hopeful
than
for
months
back
but
the
nurses
looked
dubious
and
could
not
be
induced
to
speak
of
her
recovery
with
any
certitude
on
the
tenth
of
august
claire
packed
her
boxes
with
the
aid
of
a
very
mountain
of
tissue
paper
and
set
forth
on
her
journey
the
train
deposited
her
at
hazlemere
station
outside
which
mrs
fanshawe
was
waiting
in
a
big
cream
car
smiling
her
gay
quizzical
smile
she
was
one
of
the
fortunate
women
who
possess
the
happy
knack
of
making
a
guest
feel
comfortable
and
at
home
and
her
welcome
sent
claire
spirits
racing
upwards
many
times
during
the
last
fortnight
had
she
debated
the
wisdom
of
visiting
erskine
fanshawe
home
but
the
temptation
was
so
strong
that
at
every
conflict
prudence
went
to
the
wall
it
was
not
in
girl
nature
to
resist
the
longing
to
see
his
home
and
renew
her
acquaintance
with
his
mother
and
as
it
had
been
repeatedly
stated
that
he
himself
was
to
spend
most
of
august
in
scotland
she
was
absolved
from
any
ulterior
design
janet
willoughby
had
obviously
looked
upon
the
visit
with
disfavour
but
claire
was
too
to
be
willing
to
victimise
herself
for
such
a
prejudice
janet
would
have
a
fair
field
in
scotland
she
could
not
hold
the
whole
kingdom
as
a
preserve
you
are
looking
charming
my
dear
mrs
fanshawe
said
i
always
say
it
is
one
of
the
tests
of
a
lady
to
know
how
to
dress
for
a
journey
a
little
pale
perhaps
but
we
shall
soon
change
that
this
high
air
is
better
than
any
tonic
i
laze
about
during
the
heat
of
the
day
and
have
a
two
hours
spin
after
tea
i
never
appear
until
eleven
and
i
rest
in
my
own
room
between
lunch
and
tea
so
you
wo
have
too
much
of
my
society
but
i
a
big
box
of
new
books
from
mudie
for
you
to
read
and
there
a
at
your
disposal
so
i
dare
say
you
can
amuse
yourself
i
love
companionship
but
i
could
talk
to
the
cleverest
woman
in
europe
for
twelve
hours
at
a
stretch
nor
i
agreed
claire
who
to
tell
the
truth
was
more
elated
at
the
prospect
of
so
much
time
to
herself
than
she
felt
it
discreet
to
betray
she
was
enchanted
with
her
first
view
of
the
beautiful
surrey
landscape
and
each
turn
of
the
road
as
they
sped
uphill
seemed
to
open
out
more
lovely
vistas
they
drove
past
spinneys
of
pine
trees
past
picturesque
villages
consisting
of
an
old
inn
a
few
scattered
cottages
a
pond
and
a
green
along
high
roads
below
which
the
great
plain
of
country
lay
simmering
in
a
misty
haze
then
presently
the
road
took
a
sudden
air
of
cultivation
and
claire
staring
curiously
discovered
that
the
broad
margin
of
grass
below
the
hedge
on
either
side
was
mown
and
rolled
to
a
smoothness
the
edges
also
being
clipped
in
as
accurate
a
line
as
within
the
most
carefully
tended
garden
for
several
hundred
yards
the
margin
stretched
ahead
smooth
as
the
softest
velvet
a
sight
so
rare
and
refreshing
to
the
eye
that
claire
could
not
restrain
her
delight
but
how
charming
how
unexpected
i
never
saw
a
lane
so
swept
and
garnished
it
has
a
wonderful
effect
those
two
long
lines
of
sward
it
sward
grass
is
too
common
a
word
but
what
an
amount
of
work
twenty
maids
with
twenty
mops
sweeping
for
half
a
i
think
the
whole
neighbourhood
ought
to
be
grateful
to
the
owner
of
this
land
mrs
fanshawe
beamed
complacently
i
glad
you
think
so
am
the
owner
this
is
my
property
mine
for
my
lifetime
and
my
son
after
me
it
one
of
my
hobbies
to
keep
the
lane
mown
i
like
to
be
tidy
outside
as
well
as
in
erskine
began
by
thinking
it
a
ridiculous
waste
of
work
but
his
friends
are
so
enthusiastic
about
the
result
that
he
is
now
complacently
convinced
that
it
was
entirely
his
own
idea
that
a
man
my
dear
illogical
the
best
of
and
you
never
change
them
till
the
end
of
time
what
your
opinion
of
men
i
rather
like
them
replied
claire
with
a
which
kept
her
listener
chuckling
with
amusement
until
the
lodge
gates
were
reached
and
the
car
turned
into
the
drive
the
house
was
less
imposing
than
the
grounds
just
a
large
comfortable
english
country
house
handsome
and
dignified
but
not
venerable
in
any
way
the
hall
was
good
running
the
entire
length
of
the
house
and
opening
by
tall
double
doors
on
to
the
grounds
at
the
rear
in
summer
these
doors
were
kept
open
and
allowed
a
visitor
a
charming
vista
of
rose
pergolas
and
the
foliage
of
an
old
cedar
all
the
walls
of
the
house
from
top
to
bottom
were
painted
a
creamy
white
and
there
was
noticeable
a
prevailing
touch
of
red
in
turkey
carpets
covers
and
chintzes
tea
was
served
on
a
verandah
and
after
it
was
over
mrs
fanshawe
escorted
her
visitor
round
the
flower
gardens
and
finally
upstairs
to
her
own
bedroom
where
she
was
left
with
the
announcement
that
dinner
would
be
served
at
eight
after
dinner
the
ladies
played
patience
drank
two
glasses
of
and
retired
to
bed
at
ten
it
was
not
exciting
but
on
the
other
hand
it
was
certainly
not
dull
for
mrs
fanshawe
personality
was
so
keen
so
youthful
in
its
appreciation
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
be
infected
and
share
in
her
enjoyment
the
next
week
passed
quickly
and
pleasantly
the
weather
was
good
allowing
long
drives
over
the
lovely
country
a
tennis
party
at
home
and
another
at
a
neighbouring
house
introduced
a
little
variety
into
the
programme
and
best
of
all
mrs
fanshawe
grew
daily
more
friendly
even
affectionate
in
manner
she
was
a
woman
of
little
depth
of
character
whose
main
object
in
life
was
to
amuse
herself
and
avoid
trouble
but
she
had
humour
and
intelligence
and
made
an
agreeable
companion
for
a
summer
holiday
as
her
intimacy
with
her
guest
increased
she
spoke
continually
of
her
son
referring
to
his
marriage
with
janet
willoughby
with
an
air
of
complacent
certitude
of
course
he
will
marry
janet
they
been
attached
for
years
but
the
young
men
of
are
so
deliberate
they
are
not
in
a
hurry
to
give
up
their
freedom
janet
will
be
just
the
right
wife
for
erskine
good
tempered
and
yielding
he
is
a
dear
person
but
obstinate
when
he
once
makes
up
his
mind
nothing
will
move
him
it
would
never
do
for
him
to
have
a
wife
i
disapprove
of
pandering
to
men
snapped
claire
in
her
most
high
school
manner
whereupon
the
conversation
branched
off
to
a
discussion
on
women
rights
which
was
just
what
she
had
intended
and
desired
on
the
seventh
afternoon
of
her
visit
claire
was
in
her
room
writing
a
letter
to
sophie
when
she
heard
a
sudden
tumult
below
and
felt
her
heart
bound
at
the
sound
of
a
familiar
voice
the
pen
dropped
from
her
hand
and
she
sat
transfixed
her
cheeks
burning
with
excitement
it
could
not
be
it
was
preposterous
impossible
he
was
in
scotland
only
that
morning
there
had
been
a
it
was
impossible
impossible
and
then
again
came
the
sound
of
that
voice
that
laugh
and
she
was
on
her
feet
running
across
the
floor
opening
the
door
listening
with
straining
ears
a
voice
rose
clear
and
distinct
from
the
hall
beneath
the
deep
strong
voice
about
which
there
could
be
no
mistake
a
perfect
flood
the
last
five
days
have
been
hopeless
i
was
tired
of
being
soaked
to
the
skin
and
having
to
change
my
clothes
every
two
hours
so
i
cut
it
picked
up
humphreys
in
town
and
came
along
home
and
how
have
you
been
getting
on
mater
you
look
uncommonly
fit
i
quite
well
i
am
perfectly
well
you
need
not
have
come
home
on
my
account
mrs
fanshawe
voice
had
a
decided
edge
i
suppose
this
is
just
a
flying
visit
you
will
be
going
on
to
pay
another
visit
i
have
a
friend
with
me
a
miss
gifford
you
met
her
at
the
willoughbys
so
i
did
yes
that
all
right
i
glad
you
had
company
i
suppose
i
be
moving
on
one
of
these
days
i
say
mother
what
about
tea
claire
shut
the
door
softly
and
turned
back
into
the
room
voice
had
sounded
absolutely
normal
and
unmoved
judging
by
it
no
one
could
have
imagined
that
miss
gifford
presence
or
absence
afforded
him
the
slightest
interest
and
yet
and
yet
the
mysterious
inner
voice
was
speaking
again
declaring
that
it
was
not
the
wet
weather
which
had
driven
him
back
that
he
had
hurried
home
because
he
knew
he
knew
in
ten
minutes
time
tea
would
be
served
claire
did
not
change
her
dress
or
make
any
alteration
in
her
simple
attire
her
energies
during
those
few
minutes
were
chiefly
devoted
to
cooling
her
flushed
cheeks
and
when
the
gong
sounded
she
ran
downstairs
letters
in
hand
and
evinced
a
politely
impersonal
surprise
at
the
sight
of
captain
erskine
and
his
friend
mrs
fanshawe
eyes
followed
the
girl
movements
with
a
keen
scrutiny
it
seemed
to
her
that
claire
indifference
was
a
trifle
overdone
erskine
also
was
unnaturally
composed
under
ordinary
circumstances
such
a
meeting
would
have
called
forth
a
frank
natural
pleasure
she
set
her
lips
and
determined
to
leave
nothing
to
chance
chapter
twenty
the
flowery
way
only
a
few
hours
before
her
son
unexpected
arrival
mrs
fanshawe
had
warmly
pressed
claire
to
extend
her
visit
to
a
fortnight
at
least
and
claire
had
happily
agreed
mrs
fanshawe
recalled
the
incident
as
she
poured
out
tea
and
rated
herself
for
her
imprudence
but
the
deed
was
done
there
was
the
girl
looking
pretty
enough
to
turn
any
young
head
and
there
alas
was
erskine
who
should
by
all
the
laws
of
what
was
right
and
proper
be
even
now
making
love
to
janet
willoughby
in
scotland
janet
was
rich
janet
was
well
born
janet
was
amiable
and
easily
led
for
years
past
mrs
fanshawe
had
set
her
heart
on
janet
as
a
and
she
was
not
easily
turned
from
her
purpose
throughout
that
first
afternoon
her
thoughts
were
busily
engaged
planning
ahead
striving
to
arrange
the
days
to
the
hindrance
of
dangerous
erskine
appeared
to
have
returned
in
ignorance
of
miss
gifford
presence
mrs
fanshawe
had
been
careful
to
avoid
all
reference
to
the
girl
in
her
letters
and
was
unable
to
think
how
the
information
could
have
leaked
out
nevertheless
the
choice
of
major
humphreys
as
a
companion
filled
her
with
suspicion
never
before
had
such
an
invitation
been
given
on
erskine
initiative
on
more
than
one
occasion
indeed
he
had
confessed
that
he
found
the
major
a
bore
and
had
expressed
surprise
at
his
mother
liking
for
so
dull
a
man
mrs
fanshawe
had
never
found
the
major
dull
since
he
shared
with
enthusiasm
her
own
passion
for
gardening
and
was
a
most
valuable
adviser
and
assistant
together
they
had
planned
the
flagged
path
winding
low
between
the
high
banks
of
the
rock
garden
together
they
had
planted
the
feathery
white
arenaria
calearica
in
the
crevices
of
the
steps
leading
upward
to
the
pergola
together
they
had
planned
the
effect
of
clusters
of
and
red
tulips
among
the
long
grasses
in
the
orchard
there
was
never
any
dearth
of
conversation
between
major
humphreys
and
mrs
fanshawe
and
a
stroll
round
the
rose
garden
might
easily
prolong
itself
into
a
discussion
lasting
a
couple
of
hours
hence
came
the
suspicion
or
erskine
knew
as
much
and
had
deliberately
invited
this
man
before
any
one
of
his
own
friends
despite
all
appearance
to
the
contrary
mrs
fanshawe
felt
convinced
that
the
bore
had
been
brought
down
to
engage
her
own
attention
and
so
leave
her
son
free
to
follow
his
own
devices
she
set
her
lips
and
determined
on
a
counter
move
a
was
dangerous
under
the
circumstances
safety
lay
in
a
crowd
that
evening
when
mrs
fanshawe
retired
to
dress
for
dinner
the
telephone
in
her
boudoir
was
used
to
ring
up
all
the
big
houses
in
the
neighbourhood
invitations
were
given
galore
for
tennis
for
dinner
for
lunch
and
return
invitations
were
accepted
without
consultation
with
her
son
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
she
hung
up
the
receiver
satisfied
that
erskine
opportunities
for
would
be
few
perhaps
also
time
would
suggest
some
excuse
for
shortening
the
girl
visit
to
the
ten
days
originally
planned
she
must
think
it
out
put
her
wits
to
work
claire
was
a
pretty
creature
and
a
delightful
companion
but
a
nobody
and
poor
into
the
bargain
she
could
not
be
allowed
to
upset
a
cherished
plan
during
dinner
mrs
fanshawe
alluded
casually
to
the
coming
gaieties
and
mentally
paid
a
tribute
of
admiration
to
the
with
which
claire
listened
and
smiled
betraying
not
a
flicker
of
surprise
at
the
sudden
change
of
programme
the
good
lady
was
so
pleased
with
the
result
of
her
own
scheming
that
when
later
on
the
major
proposed
a
game
of
patience
she
accepted
at
once
and
viewed
with
equanimity
the
sight
of
the
two
young
people
strolling
down
the
garden
path
it
would
be
the
last
night
when
such
an
escape
would
be
possible
it
was
an
exquisite
moonlight
night
clear
enough
to
show
the
colour
of
the
flowers
in
the
beds
and
borders
claire
white
dress
took
on
a
ghostly
hue
against
the
deep
background
of
the
trees
her
cheeks
were
pale
too
and
the
long
line
of
eyelash
showed
dark
against
her
cheeks
she
felt
very
happy
very
content
just
the
least
little
bit
in
the
world
afraid
captain
fanshawe
was
smoking
a
cigarette
and
in
the
intervals
drawing
deep
sighs
of
enjoyment
there
only
one
thing
that
worries
me
why
did
i
come
back
last
week
to
think
of
rain
and
mist
and
smoky
fires
and
then
this
i
feel
like
a
man
who
has
been
transported
into
fairyland
claire
felt
as
if
she
also
was
in
fairyland
but
she
did
not
say
so
there
are
things
that
a
girl
does
not
say
they
paced
up
and
down
the
winding
paths
and
came
to
the
flight
of
steps
leading
to
the
pergola
the
flowery
way
as
mrs
fanshawe
loved
to
call
it
where
the
arenaria
calearica
shone
starry
white
in
the
moonlight
erskine
stopped
short
and
said
urgently
would
you
mind
walking
on
alone
for
a
few
yards
i
stand
here
while
you
go
up
the
steps
please
claire
stared
in
surprise
but
there
seemed
no
reason
to
deny
so
simple
a
request
and
what
am
i
to
do
when
i
get
there
just
stand
still
for
a
moment
and
then
walk
on
i
come
after
claire
laughed
shrugged
and
went
slowly
forward
along
the
flagged
path
up
the
stair
to
pause
beneath
an
arch
of
pink
roses
and
look
back
with
an
inquiring
smile
erskine
was
standing
where
she
had
left
him
but
he
did
not
smile
in
response
while
one
might
have
counted
twenty
he
remained
motionless
his
look
grave
and
intent
then
he
came
quickly
forward
leapt
up
the
shallow
steps
and
stood
by
her
side
thank
you
he
said
tersely
but
that
was
all
neither
then
or
later
came
any
explanation
of
the
strange
request
for
a
few
moments
there
was
silence
then
erskine
harked
back
to
his
former
subject
scottish
scenery
is
very
fine
but
for
restful
loveliness
surrey
is
hard
to
beat
you
have
told
me
yet
how
you
like
our
little
place
miss
gifford
it
on
a
very
modest
scale
but
i
fond
of
it
a
homey
feeling
about
it
that
one
misses
in
bigger
places
and
the
mater
is
a
genius
at
gardening
and
gets
the
maximum
of
effect
out
of
the
space
are
you
fond
of
a
garden
i
never
had
one
claire
said
and
sighed
at
the
thought
one
of
the
joys
that
does
go
with
a
roving
life
i
never
been
able
to
have
as
many
flowers
as
i
wanted
or
to
choose
the
right
foliage
to
go
with
them
or
to
pick
them
with
the
dew
on
their
leaves
she
paused
smitten
with
a
sudden
recollection
one
day
this
year
a
close
smouldering
day
i
came
in
from
school
and
found
a
box
full
of
roses
there
were
on
the
leaves
or
what
looked
like
dewdrops
they
were
as
fresh
as
if
they
had
been
gathered
an
hour
before
dozens
of
roses
with
great
long
stems
they
made
my
room
into
a
bower
really
did
they
how
very
jolly
was
erskine
comment
his
voice
sounded
cool
and
unperturbed
and
claire
did
not
venture
to
look
at
his
face
she
thought
with
a
pang
that
perhaps
after
all
she
had
been
mistaken
perhaps
mrs
willoughby
had
been
the
real
donor
perhaps
he
had
never
thought
she
hurried
on
terrified
lest
her
thoughts
might
be
suspected
mrs
fanshawe
has
been
so
kind
allowing
me
to
send
boxes
of
fruit
and
flowers
to
a
friend
in
hospital
one
of
our
mistresses
who
is
being
treated
for
rheumatism
poor
creature
said
the
captain
with
careless
sympathy
dull
work
being
in
hospital
in
this
weather
how
have
you
been
getting
on
with
my
mother
miss
gifford
i
awfully
glad
to
find
you
down
here
though
i
should
have
enjoyed
showing
you
round
myself
i
a
bit
jealous
of
the
mater
there
she
a
delightful
companion
is
she
so
keen
and
alert
i
do
know
any
woman
of
her
age
who
is
so
young
in
spirit
it
a
great
gift
but
he
paused
drew
another
cigarette
from
his
case
and
stared
at
it
reflectively
it
has
its
drawbacks
yes
i
can
understand
that
it
must
be
hard
to
feel
young
to
young
in
heart
and
mind
and
to
be
handicapped
by
a
body
that
persists
in
growing
old
i
often
thought
how
trying
it
must
be
i
suppose
so
yes
i
afraid
i
was
thinking
about
it
in
that
light
i
was
not
discussing
the
position
from
my
mother
point
of
view
but
from
her
son
it
would
be
easier
sometimes
to
deal
with
a
placid
old
lady
who
was
content
with
her
knitting
and
cherished
an
fashioned
belief
in
the
superiority
of
man
well
let
us
say
the
equality
but
the
mater
wo
even
grant
that
by
virtue
of
her
superior
years
she
is
under
the
impression
that
she
can
still
manage
my
affairs
better
than
i
can
myself
which
of
course
is
a
profound
delusion
looking
at
the
firmly
cut
profile
it
seemed
ridiculous
to
think
of
any
one
managing
this
man
if
it
were
not
his
will
to
be
managed
mother
and
son
were
alike
in
possessing
an
obstinate
a
conflict
between
them
would
be
no
light
thing
claire
sympathies
leant
to
the
woman
side
it
must
be
very
difficult
for
a
mother
to
realise
that
her
son
is
really
past
her
control
and
when
she
it
must
be
a
painful
feeling
it
is
painful
for
the
son
it
only
annoying
the
mother
fares
worst
captain
fanshawe
laughed
and
looked
down
at
the
girl
face
with
admiring
eyes
what
a
faculty
you
have
of
seeing
the
other
side
do
you
always
take
the
part
of
the
person
who
is
here
if
so
all
the
better
for
me
this
last
week
when
the
mater
has
been
spinning
stories
of
my
obstinacy
and
and
general
contradictiveness
i
thought
i
had
better
hurry
home
at
once
before
you
learnt
to
put
me
down
as
a
hopeless
bad
lot
claire
stood
still
staring
with
widened
eyes
hurry
home
hurry
home
before
she
stopped
short
furious
with
herself
for
having
taken
any
notice
of
the
slip
and
erskine
gave
a
short
embarrassed
laugh
and
cried
hastily
oh
i
knew
of
course
i
knew
the
rain
was
only
an
excuse
the
real
reason
was
that
as
soon
as
i
knew
you
were
staying
here
i
patience
to
stay
on
i
stood
it
for
exactly
three
hours
thinking
of
you
in
this
garden
imagining
walking
about
as
we
are
walking
now
and
then
i
bolted
for
the
afternoon
train
claire
felt
her
cheeks
flame
and
affected
dignity
to
hide
her
deep
uncontrollable
joy
if
had
been
your
hostess
but
you
were
you
see
you
were
for
goodness
sake
do
put
yourself
in
her
place
next
be
claire
gifford
for
once
and
say
you
are
glad
to
see
me
his
eyes
met
hers
and
twinkled
with
humour
as
he
added
solemnly
there
not
a
single
solitary
convention
that
could
possibly
be
broken
by
being
civil
to
a
man
in
his
own
home
even
your
ultra
sensitive
conscience
never
mind
my
sensitive
conscience
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
did
you
know
who
told
you
that
i
was
here
it
was
significant
that
the
possibility
that
mrs
fanshawe
had
written
of
her
guest
never
occurred
to
claire
mind
that
erskine
like
herself
discounted
such
a
possibility
he
replied
with
a
simplicity
which
left
claire
marvelling
at
the
obtuseness
of
mankind
janet
of
course
janet
willoughby
we
were
staying
in
the
same
house
we
were
talking
of
you
yesterday
morning
and
comparing
notes
generally
she
said
you
were
oh
quite
a
number
of
agreeable
things
and
i
agreed
with
her
with
just
one
exception
she
considered
that
you
were
responsive
i
said
i
had
never
found
any
one
less
so
she
said
you
were
always
so
ready
to
meet
her
halfway
i
complained
that
you
refused
to
meet
me
at
all
i
er
told
her
how
i
felt
about
it
and
she
said
my
chance
was
waiting
if
i
choose
to
take
it
that
you
were
staying
here
keeping
the
mater
company
so
claire
said
nothing
she
was
thinking
deeply
for
how
many
days
had
janet
been
staying
in
the
same
house
with
erskine
perhaps
a
week
certainly
several
days
yet
it
had
been
only
yesterday
morning
that
she
had
given
the
news
yesterday
morning
and
in
three
hours
he
had
flown
how
was
janet
faring
now
while
claire
was
walking
in
fairyland
you
are
not
angry
why
do
you
look
so
serious
tell
me
you
are
not
sorry
that
i
came
said
a
deep
voice
close
to
her
ear
but
before
she
had
time
to
answer
footsteps
approached
and
mrs
fanshawe
voice
was
heard
calling
in
raised
accents
erskine
are
you
there
give
me
your
arm
dear
i
am
so
tired
such
a
perfect
night
that
it
seemed
a
shame
to
stay
indoors
the
major
has
been
admiring
flowery
way
it
certainly
looks
its
best
night
she
turned
towards
major
humphreys
with
her
light
cynical
laugh
my
son
declares
that
it
is
profanation
to
allow
ordinary
commonplace
mortals
to
walk
up
those
steps
he
always
escorts
my
visitors
round
by
another
way
he
is
ungallant
enough
to
say
that
he
has
never
yet
seen
a
girl
whom
he
would
care
to
watch
walk
up
those
steps
in
the
moonlight
she
would
have
to
be
quite
ideal
in
every
respect
to
fit
into
the
picture
we
go
round
by
the
lily
garden
erskine
and
then
i
think
miss
gifford
and
i
will
be
off
to
bed
you
men
will
enjoy
a
smoke
for
the
next
ten
minutes
mrs
fanshawe
kept
tight
hold
of
her
son
arm
and
claire
talked
assiduously
to
major
humphreys
she
knew
now
why
erskine
had
asked
her
to
walk
ahead
up
the
flowery
way
chapter
twenty
one
all
in
a
garden
fair
the
next
afternoon
a
party
of
friends
had
been
bidden
for
tennis
for
the
morning
no
plans
had
been
made
but
throughout
its
length
mrs
fanshawe
fought
a
gallant
fight
against
overwhelming
odds
and
was
hopelessly
beaten
for
her
pains
it
was
her
strong
determination
that
her
son
should
be
prevented
from
holding
another
with
claire
gifford
erskine
actively
and
claire
passively
desired
and
intended
to
bring
about
just
that
very
consummation
while
major
humphreys
shrewdly
aware
of
the
purpose
for
which
he
had
been
invited
aided
and
abetted
their
efforts
by
the
development
of
a
veritable
frenzy
of
gardening
enthusiasm
he
questioned
he
disputed
he
meekly
acknowledged
his
mistakes
he
propounded
schemes
for
fresh
developments
the
scenes
of
which
lay
invariably
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
grounds
from
that
in
which
the
young
people
were
ensconced
mrs
fanshawe
struggled
valiantly
but
the
triple
entente
won
the
day
and
for
a
good
two
hours
before
lunch
erskine
and
claire
remained
happily
lost
to
sight
in
the
farthest
recesses
of
the
grounds
they
had
left
behind
the
region
of
formal
seats
and
benches
and
sat
on
the
grass
at
the
foot
of
a
great
chestnut
whose
dark
green
foliage
made
a
haven
of
shade
in
the
midst
of
the
noonday
glare
claire
wore
her
bargain
frock
and
felt
thankful
for
the
extravagant
impulse
of
that
january
morn
erskine
was
in
flannels
cool
and
becoming
as
a
man
invariably
is
both
had
discarded
hats
and
sat
bareheaded
in
the
blessed
shade
and
erskine
asked
questions
dozens
of
questions
a
very
examination
the
subject
being
the
life
history
thoughts
hopes
ambitions
and
dreams
of
the
girl
by
his
side
you
were
an
only
child
so
was
i
were
you
a
lonely
little
kiddie
no
i
do
think
i
was
my
mother
was
a
child
with
me
we
were
blissfully
happy
manufacturing
a
doll
house
out
of
a
packing
chest
and
furnishing
it
with
beds
made
out
of
cardboard
boxes
and
sofas
made
out
of
i
used
to
feel
other
children
a
bore
because
they
distracted
her
attention
that
would
be
when
you
were
how
old
six
or
seven
and
you
are
now
what
is
it
i
must
have
been
a
schoolboy
of
seventeen
at
that
time
imagining
myself
a
man
ten
years
makes
a
lot
of
difference
at
that
age
it
does
count
so
much
later
on
at
least
i
should
think
not
do
i
appear
to
you
very
old
hoary
no
but
i
say
honestly
do
be
conceited
you
know
perfectly
well
but
i
wanted
to
make
sure
and
then
you
went
to
school
did
you
have
a
bad
time
at
first
among
the
other
girls
no
i
afraid
the
other
girls
had
a
bad
time
with
me
i
was
very
uppish
and
british
and
insisted
on
getting
my
own
way
did
have
a
bad
time
yes
i
did
he
said
simply
small
boys
have
a
pretty
stiff
time
of
it
during
their
first
term
and
my
time
happened
to
be
stiffer
than
most
i
may
be
as
miserable
again
i
hope
i
never
may
be
but
pretty
sure
it
impossible
to
be
miserable
than
i
was
at
nine
years
old
bullied
on
every
side
breaking
my
heart
with
home
sickness
and
too
proud
to
show
a
sign
poor
little
lad
sighed
claire
softly
and
for
a
long
minute
the
two
pairs
of
eyes
met
and
exchanged
a
message
but
afterwards
it
grew
better
after
that
oh
yes
i
learnt
to
stand
up
for
myself
and
moved
up
in
the
school
and
began
to
bully
on
my
own
did
you
make
many
real
friends
in
your
school
days
no
real
lasting
friends
they
were
french
girls
you
see
and
there
was
the
difference
of
race
and
religion
to
divide
us
as
we
grew
up
and
we
were
birds
of
passage
mother
and
i
always
moving
about
you
felt
the
need
of
companionship
no
i
had
mother
and
we
were
like
girls
together
the
twin
dimples
showed
in
a
mischievous
smile
you
seem
very
anxious
to
hear
that
i
was
lonely
well
said
erskine
and
hesitated
as
though
he
found
it
impossible
to
deny
the
accusation
i
wanted
to
feel
that
you
could
sympathise
with
me
i
been
more
or
less
lonely
all
my
life
but
i
have
always
felt
that
a
time
would
come
when
it
would
be
all
right
when
i
meet
some
one
who
understand
i
was
great
chums
with
my
father
but
he
died
when
i
was
twelve
and
my
school
chum
went
off
to
china
and
comes
home
for
a
few
months
every
three
years
when
it
has
usually
happened
that
i
been
abroad
there
are
nice
enough
fellows
in
the
regiment
but
i
suppose
i
not
quick
at
making
friends
strive
as
she
would
claire
could
not
resist
a
twinkle
of
amusement
their
eyes
met
and
both
went
off
into
a
peal
of
laughter
oh
well
there
are
exceptions
that
different
i
felt
that
i
knew
you
at
once
without
any
preliminary
stages
it
must
always
be
like
that
when
people
really
fit
and
then
after
a
short
pause
he
added
in
boyish
ingenuous
tones
did
you
feel
that
you
knew
me
i
i
think
i
did
claire
acknowledged
to
both
it
seemed
the
most
wonderful
the
most
absorbing
of
conversations
they
were
blissfully
unconscious
that
it
was
old
as
the
hills
themselves
and
had
been
repeated
with
ceaseless
reiteration
from
prehistoric
periods
only
once
was
there
an
interruption
of
the
deep
mutual
happiness
and
that
came
without
warning
claire
was
smiling
in
blissful
contentment
unconscious
of
a
care
when
suddenly
a
pain
stabbed
her
heart
imagination
had
wafted
her
back
to
she
saw
the
faces
of
the
fifteen
women
seated
around
the
table
women
who
were
with
but
one
exception
past
their
youth
approaching
nearer
and
nearer
to
dreaded
age
and
an
inward
voice
whispered
that
to
each
in
her
turn
had
come
this
golden
hour
the
hour
of
dreams
of
sweet
illuminative
hope
the
hour
had
come
and
the
hour
had
passed
leaving
behind
nothing
but
a
memory
and
a
regret
why
should
she
herself
be
more
blessed
than
others
she
looked
forward
and
saw
a
vision
of
herself
ten
years
hence
still
hurrying
along
the
street
looking
up
at
the
clock
in
the
church
tower
to
assure
herself
that
she
was
in
time
still
mounting
the
same
bare
staircase
still
hanging
up
her
hat
on
the
same
peg
the
prose
of
it
in
contradistinction
with
the
poetry
of
the
present
was
terrifying
to
claire
youthful
mind
and
her
look
was
so
white
so
strained
that
erskine
took
instant
alarm
what
is
it
what
is
it
are
you
ill
have
i
said
anything
to
upset
you
i
say
what
the
matter
nothing
nothing
i
had
a
thought
talk
hard
please
and
make
me
forget
the
end
of
the
two
hours
found
the
still
in
full
force
the
man
and
the
girl
alike
still
feeling
that
the
half
was
not
yet
told
they
resented
the
quick
passage
of
time
resented
the
disturbance
of
the
afternoon
hours
what
on
earth
do
we
want
with
a
tennis
party
grumbled
the
captain
wish
to
goodness
we
could
be
left
alone
i
suppose
the
mater
wanted
them
to
amuse
you
before
i
came
back
claire
murmured
incoherently
she
knew
better
but
she
was
not
going
to
say
so
they
turned
unwillingly
towards
the
house
in
the
afternoon
the
guests
arrived
they
came
early
for
the
fanshawe
tennis
courts
were
in
fine
condition
and
the
prospect
of
meeting
a
new
man
and
a
new
girl
plus
the
son
of
the
house
was
a
treat
in
itself
in
the
quiet
countryside
where
the
members
of
the
same
set
met
regularly
at
every
function
of
the
year
one
of
the
courts
was
reserved
for
fours
for
mrs
fanshawe
believed
in
giving
her
guests
what
they
liked
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
men
as
a
rule
are
ungallant
enough
to
prefer
their
own
sex
in
outdoor
games
in
the
second
court
the
younger
girls
took
part
in
mixed
fours
while
others
sat
about
or
took
part
in
lengthy
croquet
contests
on
the
furthest
of
the
three
lawns
claire
as
a
member
of
the
had
a
good
deal
of
time
on
her
hands
and
helped
mrs
fanshawe
with
the
entertainment
of
the
older
guests
who
one
and
all
eyed
her
with
speculative
interest
one
thin
faded
woman
had
spent
a
few
years
in
bombay
and
was
roused
to
interest
by
hearing
that
claire
mother
was
now
settled
in
that
city
yes
she
had
met
a
mr
judge
robert
judge
was
it
not
her
husband
knew
him
quite
well
he
had
dined
at
their
house
quite
a
dear
man
she
had
heard
of
his
marriage
but
here
came
a
look
of
mystification
to
a
wife
very
pretty
very
charming
claire
laughed
and
held
out
a
little
coloured
photograph
in
a
round
glass
frame
which
hung
by
a
chain
round
her
neck
that
is
my
mother
she
is
and
looks
thirty
and
she
is
prettier
than
that
the
faded
lady
looked
and
sighed
mrs
fanshawe
brightened
into
vivid
interest
you
know
mr
judge
then
you
have
met
him
that
quite
interesting
that
very
interesting
claire
realised
with
some
irritability
that
the
fact
that
one
of
her
own
acquaintances
knew
and
approved
instantaneously
raised
mr
judge
in
her
hostess
estimation
hitherto
he
had
been
a
name
a
nobody
now
he
became
a
real
man
quite
a
dear
man
a
man
one
could
know
the
result
was
satisfactory
enough
but
claire
was
irritated
by
the
means
she
was
irritated
also
by
the
subtle
but
very
real
change
in
her
hostess
manner
to
herself
in
the
last
hours
irritated
because
the
precious
hours
were
passing
and
erskine
was
surrounded
by
his
guests
playing
endless
sets
on
the
hot
lawn
he
looked
as
though
he
were
enjoying
himself
too
and
that
added
to
her
annoyance
for
like
many
another
girl
she
had
not
yet
realised
that
a
man
can
forget
even
his
love
in
his
enjoyment
of
sport
at
however
there
was
a
lull
when
erskine
carried
a
chair
to
claire
side
and
seated
himself
with
an
air
of
contentment
once
and
again
as
the
meal
progressed
she
saw
his
eyes
rove
around
and
then
come
back
to
dwell
upon
herself
she
knew
that
he
was
comparing
her
with
the
other
girls
who
were
present
knew
also
by
the
deep
glow
of
that
returning
glance
that
in
his
eyes
she
was
fairest
and
best
the
former
irritation
dropped
from
her
like
a
cloak
tea
was
over
the
guests
rose
from
their
seats
erskine
stood
by
claire
side
looking
down
at
her
with
a
quizzical
smile
er
did
you
notice
that
man
who
came
in
just
before
tea
with
the
girl
in
the
pink
frock
he
was
sitting
over
there
on
the
right
yes
i
noticed
him
i
could
see
him
quite
well
why
what
did
you
think
of
him
quite
nice
i
liked
his
face
and
interesting
erskine
laughed
sure
quite
sure
why
do
recognise
him
at
all
does
remind
you
of
any
one
you
know
not
in
the
least
why
should
he
erskine
laughed
again
i
afraid
your
memory
is
defective
i
must
introduce
you
again
he
walked
away
laid
his
hand
on
the
arm
of
the
and
led
him
back
to
claire
side
miss
gifford
he
said
gravely
allow
me
to
introduce
major
carew
chapter
twenty
two
found
out
the
man
with
the
interesting
face
bowed
to
claire
with
the
alacrity
which
the
normal
man
shows
at
an
introduction
to
a
pretty
girl
claire
stared
blankly
recovered
herself
and
returned
his
bow
in
formal
manner
erskine
looked
from
one
to
the
other
in
undisguised
surprise
i
thought
you
had
met
you
told
me
you
had
met
carew
in
town
not
major
carew
claire
could
not
suppress
a
tone
of
regret
with
all
her
heart
she
wished
that
the
man
before
her
had
been
fiance
it
was
the
same
name
but
not
the
same
man
it
not
an
unusual
name
i
expect
there
are
several
of
us
knocking
about
the
present
major
carew
said
smilingly
do
you
happen
to
know
his
regiment
claire
knew
it
well
but
as
she
pronounced
the
name
the
hearer
face
crinkled
in
confusion
but
that
is
my
own
regiment
there
no
other
carew
there
some
mistake
you
have
mixed
up
the
names
oh
no
i
heard
it
a
hundred
times
it
is
impossible
to
be
mistaken
his
christian
name
is
frank
name
is
frank
the
strange
man
said
and
stared
at
claire
in
increasing
perplexity
there
is
certainly
not
another
frank
carew
in
the
m
there
is
something
wrong
about
this
i
do
understand
he
is
a
member
of
the
club
and
his
people
live
in
surrey
he
has
an
old
father
who
is
an
invalid
and
the
name
of
the
house
is
moat
major
carew
face
turned
a
deep
apoplectic
red
his
light
eyes
seemed
to
protrude
from
his
head
so
violent
was
his
anger
and
surprise
but
that
that
my
club
my
father
my
home
somebody
has
been
taking
my
name
and
passing
himself
off
under
false
colours
for
some
mysterious
reason
i
ca
imagine
what
good
it
is
going
to
do
him
he
broke
off
in
alarm
and
cast
an
appealing
look
at
erskine
as
claire
suddenly
collapsed
on
the
nearest
chair
her
face
as
white
as
her
gown
i
say
this
is
a
bad
business
i
most
awfully
sorry
i
afraid
miss
gifford
is
distressed
erskine
lips
were
set
in
a
fury
of
anger
he
glanced
at
claire
and
turned
hurriedly
away
as
though
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
look
at
her
blanched
face
to
see
the
glint
of
his
eye
the
set
of
the
firm
jaw
was
to
realise
that
it
would
fare
badly
with
the
masquerader
should
he
come
within
reach
there
was
a
moment
of
tense
unhappy
silence
then
erskine
drew
forward
two
more
chairs
and
motioned
to
the
major
to
be
seated
i
think
we
shall
have
to
thresh
this
out
it
is
naturally
a
shock
but
miss
gifford
acquaintance
with
this
person
is
very
slight
she
took
a
violent
dislike
to
him
at
first
sight
so
you
need
not
fear
that
she
will
feel
any
personal
distress
that
is
so
is
it
that
the
real
position
claire
nodded
a
quick
assent
yes
yes
i
met
him
twice
and
i
hated
him
from
the
first
but
my
friend
believes
her
voice
broke
and
she
struggled
for
composure
her
chin
quivering
with
pitiful
distress
he
is
engaged
to
be
to
my
friend
a
deep
murmur
of
anger
came
simultaneously
from
both
hearers
the
real
major
carew
straightened
himself
with
an
air
of
determination
engaged
to
her
under
my
name
this
is
too
strong
and
in
the
name
of
wonder
what
for
i
nobody
i
nothing
i
the
most
insignificant
of
fellows
and
chronically
hard
up
what
had
he
to
gain
by
taking
my
name
you
are
a
gentleman
and
he
is
not
everything
is
comparative
he
wanted
to
impress
my
friend
and
he
knew
you
so
well
that
it
was
easy
to
pretend
and
make
up
a
good
tale
he
he
was
hard
up
he
he
borrowed
money
from
the
girl
again
came
that
deep
murmur
of
indignation
what
an
unspeakable
cur
and
excuse
me
what
a
girl
to
have
anything
to
do
with
him
after
that
could
you
do
nothing
to
prevent
her
making
such
a
fool
of
herself
nothing
i
tried
i
tried
hard
but
erskine
looked
at
her
with
his
keen
level
glance
and
she
borrowed
from
you
to
supply
his
needs
no
never
mind
i
ask
any
more
questions
but
i
know
i
know
his
eyes
hardened
again
as
he
turned
towards
the
other
man
carew
this
is
pure
swindling
we
shall
have
to
worry
this
out
i
believe
you
my
boy
said
the
major
tersely
he
turned
to
claire
and
added
more
gently
tell
us
some
more
about
this
fellow
miss
gifford
describe
him
would
you
recognise
him
if
you
met
again
oh
yes
at
once
he
is
tall
and
dark
i
suppose
though
i
detest
his
type
very
dark
eyes
large
features
the
major
ruminated
finding
apparently
no
clue
in
the
description
tall
dark
large
features
i
know
about
a
hundred
men
to
whom
that
description
might
apply
could
you
think
of
anything
more
definite
claire
ruminated
in
her
turn
recalled
the
image
of
cecil
lover
and
tried
to
remember
the
details
of
his
appearance
he
has
very
thick
hair
and
brushes
it
straight
across
his
forehead
his
eyebrows
are
very
short
he
has
a
high
colour
quite
red
cheeks
major
carew
made
a
short
choking
sound
lay
back
in
his
chair
and
stared
aghast
this
time
it
was
evident
that
the
description
awoke
a
definite
remembrance
but
he
appeared
to
thrust
it
from
him
to
find
it
difficult
to
give
credence
to
the
idea
impossible
he
murmured
to
himself
impossible
high
colour
you
say
short
eyebrows
when
you
say
what
exactly
do
you
mean
they
begin
by
being
very
thick
then
they
stop
abruptly
they
follow
the
line
of
the
eye
like
most
eyebrows
they
look
unfinished
major
carew
bounced
upon
his
chair
erskine
i
have
an
it
seems
almost
incredible
but
i
bound
to
find
if
it
is
correct
there
is
a
man
who
is
in
our
camp
now
make
an
excuse
and
send
him
over
if
you
can
arrange
that
miss
gifford
sees
him
when
he
comes
i
give
him
a
message
for
you
repeated
erskine
sharply
then
he
glanced
at
claire
and
sent
a
frowning
message
towards
the
other
man
that
can
easily
be
arranged
we
leave
it
till
evening
then
we
ca
get
any
further
now
and
i
must
get
back
to
my
duties
the
mater
is
scowling
at
me
go
and
soothe
her
like
a
good
fellow
but
for
your
life
not
a
word
of
this
to
her
major
carew
rose
obediently
perfectly
aware
that
his
company
was
not
wanted
and
erskine
bent
towards
claire
with
a
few
earnest
words
do
worry
if
this
man
is
an
impostor
the
sooner
it
is
found
out
the
better
he
an
impostor
there
no
getting
away
from
that
and
he
is
making
a
dupe
of
that
poor
girl
for
his
own
ends
if
we
had
not
made
this
discovery
he
would
have
stuck
to
her
until
he
had
bled
her
of
her
last
penny
and
then
would
probably
have
disappeared
into
space
she
knows
nothing
of
his
real
name
or
position
so
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
trace
him
and
probably
nothing
to
be
gained
if
he
found
one
reads
of
these
scoundrels
from
time
to
time
but
i
never
had
the
misfortune
to
meet
one
in
the
flesh
i
like
to
horsewhip
the
fellow
for
upsetting
you
like
this
oh
what
does
it
matter
about
me
claire
cried
impatiently
cecil
i
thinking
about
my
poor
poor
friend
she
not
young
and
she
is
tired
out
after
twelve
years
of
teaching
and
it
the
time
years
ago
a
man
pretended
to
love
her
it
was
only
pretence
and
it
nearly
broke
her
heart
she
has
never
been
the
same
since
then
it
made
her
bitter
and
distrustful
poor
creature
no
wonder
but
that
was
some
time
ago
and
now
she
is
engaged
to
this
other
fellow
is
she
in
love
with
him
do
you
suppose
claire
shrugged
vaguely
i
do
know
she
is
in
love
with
the
idea
of
a
home
and
he
you
have
seen
them
together
he
is
a
cur
there
no
getting
away
from
that
but
he
might
be
attached
to
the
girl
all
the
same
do
you
think
he
is
oh
how
can
i
tell
claire
cried
impatiently
she
thinks
he
is
but
she
thought
the
same
about
the
other
man
it
does
seem
possible
to
tell
men
amuse
themselves
and
pretend
and
act
a
part
and
then
laugh
at
a
girl
if
she
is
so
foolish
as
to
believe
captain
fanshawe
bent
forward
his
arm
resting
on
his
knees
his
face
upraised
to
hers
a
very
grave
face
fixed
and
determined
do
you
believe
that
claire
do
you
believe
what
you
are
saying
the
grey
eyes
looked
deep
into
hers
compelling
an
answer
i
i
think
many
of
them
some
of
them
the
captain
corrected
just
as
some
girls
encourage
a
man
to
gratify
their
own
vanity
they
are
the
exceptions
in
both
cases
but
you
speak
in
generalities
condemning
the
whole
sex
is
it
what
you
really
think
that
most
men
pretend
the
grey
eyes
were
on
her
face
keen
compelling
eyes
from
which
there
was
no
escape
claire
flushed
and
hesitated
no
no
i
do
not
most
but
there
are
some
we
are
not
concerned
with
he
said
quietly
and
straightening
himself
he
cast
a
glance
around
the
guests
were
standing
about
in
little
groups
aimless
irresolute
waiting
to
be
broken
up
into
twos
and
fours
and
drafted
off
to
the
empty
lawns
across
the
deserted
his
mother
eyes
met
his
coldly
reproachful
erskine
sighed
and
rose
to
his
feet
i
must
go
these
people
need
looking
after
do
look
so
sad
it
hurts
me
to
see
you
sad
just
those
few
words
and
he
was
gone
and
claire
strolled
off
in
an
opposite
direction
anxious
to
screen
herself
from
observation
among
the
crowd
she
ached
with
pity
for
cecil
but
through
all
her
distresses
the
old
confidence
lay
warm
at
her
heart
there
was
one
man
in
the
world
who
towered
high
above
the
possibility
of
deceit
and
between
that
man
and
herself
was
a
bond
stronger
than
spoken
word
the
future
seemed
full
of
difficulties
but
claire
did
not
trouble
herself
about
the
future
the
present
was
full
of
trouble
full
of
joy
it
was
seven
before
the
last
of
the
guests
had
departed
and
mrs
fanshawe
saw
to
it
that
her
son
was
fully
engaged
until
it
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner
her
keen
eyes
had
noticed
signs
of
agitation
as
the
two
young
people
sat
together
at
tea
and
what
had
erskine
been
talking
about
with
that
tense
expression
on
his
face
and
what
had
happened
to
the
girl
that
she
looked
at
one
moment
so
radiant
and
at
the
next
so
mrs
fanshawe
affections
like
those
of
most
selfish
people
were
largely
influenced
by
personal
considerations
a
week
before
she
had
felt
quite
a
warm
affection
for
the
agreeable
companion
who
had
rescued
her
from
the
boredom
of
lonely
days
now
hour
by
hour
she
was
conscious
of
a
rising
irritation
against
the
girl
who
threatened
to
interfere
with
her
own
plans
the
verdict
of
others
confirmed
her
own
suspicions
as
to
erskine
danger
for
during
the
afternoon
half
a
dozen
intimate
friends
referred
to
claire
with
significant
intonation
such
a
graceful
creature
no
wonder
erskine
is
miss
gifford
is
quite
charming
interested
to
meet
miss
gifford
eyes
and
voice
alike
testified
to
the
conviction
that
if
an
engagement
were
not
already
arranged
it
was
a
certainty
in
the
near
future
mrs
fanshawe
set
her
lips
and
determined
by
hook
or
crook
to
get
claire
gifford
out
of
the
house
that
evening
at
nine
the
announced
that
major
carew
soldier
servant
wished
to
see
captain
fanshawe
on
a
message
from
his
master
and
erskine
gave
instructions
that
he
should
be
sent
round
to
the
verandah
and
stepped
out
of
the
window
leaving
claire
wondering
and
discomfited
what
had
happened
was
the
impostor
not
to
be
found
in
her
present
tension
of
mind
any
delay
even
of
the
shortest
seemed
unbearable
the
murmur
of
voices
sounded
from
without
then
erskine
stepped
back
into
the
room
and
addressed
himself
pointedly
to
claire
but
without
using
her
name
would
you
come
out
just
for
two
minutes
it
some
plan
for
morrow
claire
crossed
the
room
acutely
conscious
of
mrs
displeasure
stepped
into
the
cool
light
of
the
verandah
and
beheld
standing
before
her
large
and
trim
in
his
soldier
uniform
lover
the
man
who
had
masqueraded
under
his
master
name
for
one
breathless
moment
the
two
stood
face
to
face
staring
aghast
too
petrified
by
surprise
to
be
able
to
move
or
speak
claire
caught
hold
of
the
nearest
chair
and
clutched
at
its
back
the
florid
colour
died
out
of
the
man
cheeks
his
eyes
glazed
with
horror
and
dismay
then
with
a
rapid
he
leapt
from
the
steps
and
sped
down
the
drive
another
moment
and
he
had
disappeared
and
the
two
who
were
left
faced
each
other
aghast
his
servant
his
oh
my
poor
cecil
the
scoundrel
it
was
a
clever
ruse
no
need
to
invent
details
he
had
them
all
ready
to
his
hand
the
question
is
what
next
the
game
is
up
and
he
knows
it
what
will
be
his
next
move
claire
shook
her
head
she
was
white
and
shaken
the
reality
was
even
worse
than
she
had
expected
and
the
thought
of
cecil
bitterness
of
disillusion
weighed
on
her
like
a
nightmare
she
tried
to
speak
but
her
lips
trembled
and
erskine
drew
near
with
a
quick
word
of
consolation
claire
what
is
this
plan
erskine
am
i
not
to
be
consulted
remember
that
you
are
engaged
to
lunch
with
the
montgomerys
mrs
fanshawe
stood
in
the
doorway
erect
haughty
obviously
annoyed
her
keen
eyes
rested
on
claire
face
demanding
a
reason
for
her
embarrassment
erskine
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
and
offered
a
short
explanation
a
disagreeable
thing
has
happened
mother
miss
gifford
has
discovered
through
major
carew
that
a
friend
is
in
serious
trouble
it
has
been
rather
a
shock
dear
me
yes
it
would
be
perhaps
you
would
like
to
go
to
your
room
my
dear
i
tired
myself
and
shall
be
glad
to
get
to
bed
i
am
sure
you
must
wish
to
be
alone
shall
we
go
claire
said
good
night
to
the
two
men
and
went
wearily
upstairs
at
this
moment
even
her
own
inward
happiness
failed
to
console
when
contrasted
with
her
own
fate
cecil
seemed
so
cruelly
unfair
chapter
twenty
three
no
sleep
refused
to
come
to
claire
that
night
she
lay
tossing
on
her
bed
while
the
old
clock
in
the
corridor
without
struck
hour
after
hour
two
three
four
and
still
she
tossed
and
turned
and
again
and
again
asked
herself
the
question
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
and
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
the
disillusionment
which
was
coming
to
her
poor
friend
what
was
her
own
duty
in
the
matter
obviously
cecil
must
be
told
the
truth
obviously
she
was
the
one
to
tell
it
would
it
be
possible
to
inclination
clamoured
in
favour
of
such
a
course
it
would
be
so
much
easier
it
would
obviate
the
necessity
for
a
lacerating
interview
would
it
not
be
easier
for
cecil
also
claire
felt
that
if
positions
had
been
reversed
she
would
crave
above
all
things
to
be
alone
hidden
from
the
eyes
of
even
the
most
sympathising
of
friends
but
cecil
nature
was
of
a
different
type
having
heard
the
one
abhorrent
fact
she
would
wish
to
probe
further
to
be
told
details
to
ask
a
score
of
trifling
questions
however
full
a
letter
might
be
she
would
not
be
satisfied
without
an
interview
but
i
might
write
first
and
see
her
afterwards
poor
claire
said
to
herself
it
would
not
be
quite
so
bad
when
she
had
got
over
the
first
shock
i
could
bear
to
see
her
face
it
was
five
before
at
last
sleep
came
to
drive
away
the
haunting
questions
and
when
she
woke
it
was
to
find
her
early
tea
had
grown
cold
on
the
table
by
her
side
and
to
see
on
looking
at
her
watch
that
it
was
nearly
ten
she
dressed
hurriedly
and
went
downstairs
to
find
mrs
fanshawe
alone
in
the
reading
the
she
waved
aside
claire
apologies
for
her
late
appearance
with
easy
good
nature
no
one
was
to
be
punctual
at
breakfast
it
was
sheer
tyranny
to
decree
that
visitors
should
get
up
at
a
definite
hour
if
claire
had
slept
badly
why
did
she
order
breakfast
in
her
room
and
spend
the
morning
in
bed
you
look
a
wreck
she
said
frankly
and
threw
down
the
paper
with
an
impatient
gesture
such
a
nuisance
about
this
bad
news
erskine
seems
disgusted
with
the
whole
affair
he
has
gone
off
with
major
carew
to
see
what
can
be
done
and
is
to
go
straight
to
the
willoughbys
so
tiresome
for
i
particularly
wanted
him
to
be
in
good
form
this
afternoon
what
it
all
about
as
it
has
happened
in
my
house
i
think
i
am
entitled
to
an
explanation
something
to
do
with
major
carew
servant
how
can
your
friend
be
associated
with
a
servant
the
man
has
bolted
it
appears
the
major
came
over
half
an
hour
ago
to
say
that
he
never
returned
last
night
thought
flight
the
best
policy
i
suppose
but
what
i
am
waiting
to
be
told
is
what
has
he
claire
sat
down
on
the
nearest
chair
feeling
more
of
a
wreck
than
ever
deserted
a
soldier
but
if
he
is
found
the
punishment
he
has
already
been
found
out
it
appears
so
that
it
was
a
choice
between
certain
punishment
if
he
stayed
or
the
chance
of
getting
safely
away
i
am
waiting
to
hear
what
it
all
about
oh
mrs
fanshawe
it
so
difficult
it
not
my
secret
cried
poor
claire
desperately
he
this
man
has
been
masquerading
under
his
master
name
my
friend
knew
him
as
major
carew
she
they
became
very
intimate
engaged
i
suppose
it
does
say
much
for
her
discrimination
her
ideas
of
what
constitute
a
gentleman
must
be
somewhat
vague
mrs
fanshawe
said
disagreeably
she
felt
disagreeable
and
she
never
made
any
effort
to
conceal
her
feelings
kindly
or
the
reverse
it
was
annoying
that
one
of
her
own
guests
should
be
mixed
up
in
an
unsavoury
scandal
with
a
common
soldier
annoying
to
have
people
going
about
with
long
faces
when
she
had
planned
a
festive
week
really
this
claire
gifford
was
becoming
more
and
more
of
an
incumbrance
mrs
fanshawe
paused
with
her
hand
on
the
to
ask
a
pointed
question
have
also
known
this
man
under
his
false
name
may
i
ask
claire
flushed
uncomfortably
i
met
him
twice
only
twice
for
a
very
short
time
mrs
fanshawe
did
not
speak
but
she
arched
her
eyebrows
in
a
fashion
which
was
more
scorching
than
words
so
you
also
are
ignorant
of
what
constitutes
a
gentleman
said
those
eyebrows
you
also
have
been
including
my
friend
servant
among
your
acquaintances
claire
felt
the
hopelessness
of
trying
to
justify
herself
and
relapsed
into
silence
also
the
while
she
made
a
pretence
of
eating
one
of
the
most
miserable
meals
of
her
life
according
to
his
mother
erskine
was
quite
disgusted
with
the
whole
affair
claire
heart
sank
at
the
thought
but
she
acknowledged
that
such
an
attitude
would
be
no
more
than
was
natural
under
the
circumstances
a
soldier
himself
captain
fanshawe
would
be
a
stern
judge
of
a
soldier
fraud
while
his
could
not
fail
to
be
touched
claire
had
too
much
faith
to
believe
that
his
displeasure
would
be
extended
to
herself
yet
she
was
miserably
aware
that
it
was
through
her
instrumentality
that
he
had
been
brought
in
contact
with
the
scandal
in
the
midst
of
much
confusion
of
mind
only
one
thing
seemed
certain
and
that
was
that
it
was
impossible
to
face
a
tennis
party
that
afternoon
claire
made
her
apologies
to
mrs
fanshawe
as
she
rose
from
the
table
and
they
were
accepted
with
disconcerting
readiness
of
course
of
course
i
never
imagined
that
you
would
under
the
circumstances
it
would
be
most
awkward
i
expect
by
afternoon
the
story
will
be
the
talk
of
the
place
your
friend
i
understand
is
still
ignorant
of
the
man
real
station
what
do
you
propose
to
do
with
regard
to
breaking
the
news
in
i
going
to
write
i
thought
i
would
sit
in
my
room
and
compose
a
it
will
be
difficult
difficult
mrs
fanshawe
repeated
the
word
with
disagreeable
emphasis
impossible
i
should
say
and
excuse
me
cruel
into
the
bargain
to
open
a
letter
from
a
friend
expecting
to
find
the
ordinary
and
to
receive
a
blow
that
shatters
one
life
my
dear
it
unthinkable
you
can
not
seriously
intend
it
you
think
it
would
be
better
if
i
her
claire
asked
anxiously
i
wondered
myself
but
naturally
i
dreaded
it
and
i
thought
she
might
prefer
to
get
over
the
first
shock
alone
i
had
decided
to
write
first
and
see
her
later
on
but
you
think
i
think
decidedly
that
you
ought
to
break
the
news
in
person
you
can
lead
up
to
it
more
naturally
in
words
even
the
most
carefully
written
letters
are
apt
to
read
coldly
perhaps
the
more
care
we
spend
on
them
the
more
coldly
they
read
yes
that
true
that
quite
true
but
i
thought
it
would
be
better
not
to
wait
she
is
staying
at
home
just
now
i
do
think
he
will
visit
her
there
for
he
seemed
to
shrink
from
meeting
her
mother
but
he
may
write
and
try
claire
drew
herself
up
on
the
point
of
betraying
that
borrowing
of
money
which
was
the
most
shameful
feature
of
the
fraud
but
mrs
fanshawe
was
too
much
absorbed
in
her
own
schemes
to
notice
the
omission
she
had
seen
a
way
of
getting
rid
of
an
unwelcome
guest
and
was
all
keenness
to
turn
it
to
account
he
is
sure
to
try
to
see
her
again
while
he
is
at
large
he
will
probably
urge
her
to
marry
him
at
once
you
should
certainly
not
defer
your
visit
if
it
is
to
be
of
any
use
how
dreadful
would
be
if
she
were
to
marry
him
under
an
assumed
name
you
must
let
us
interfere
with
your
arrangement
my
dear
you
only
promised
me
ten
days
so
i
ca
grumble
if
you
run
away
and
for
the
short
time
that
erskine
is
at
home
there
are
so
many
friends
to
fit
in
you
understand
i
am
sure
that
i
am
thinking
of
your
own
convenience
i
understand
perfectly
thank
you
claire
replied
her
head
in
the
air
the
indignant
colour
dying
her
cheeks
with
red
mrs
arguments
in
favour
of
haste
might
be
wise
enough
but
her
personal
desire
was
all
too
plainly
betrayed
and
she
pointedly
ignored
the
fact
that
the
proposed
interview
need
not
have
interrupted
claire
visit
since
it
and
the
journey
involved
could
easily
have
been
accomplished
in
the
course
of
a
day
i
understand
perfectly
thank
you
i
will
go
upstairs
and
pack
now
perhaps
there
is
a
train
i
could
catch
before
lunch
the
that
will
give
you
the
afternoon
in
town
order
a
fly
from
the
inn
i
sorry
for
you
dear
most
racking
to
have
to
break
bad
news
but
you
feel
happier
when
done
perhaps
you
could
take
the
poor
thing
with
you
to
that
sweet
little
farm
not
for
the
world
would
claire
have
spent
the
next
hour
in
mrs
fanshawe
company
she
hurried
to
her
room
and
placing
her
watch
on
the
so
timed
her
packing
that
it
should
not
be
completed
a
moment
before
the
lumbering
country
fly
drove
up
to
the
door
then
fully
dressed
she
descended
the
staircase
and
held
out
a
gloved
hand
to
her
hostess
apparently
unconscious
of
an
offered
kiss
it
was
some
slight
consolation
to
note
the
change
of
bearing
which
had
come
over
mrs
fanshawe
during
the
last
hour
and
to
realise
that
the
success
of
her
scheme
had
not
brought
much
satisfaction
she
was
nervous
she
was
more
than
nervous
she
was
afraid
the
while
claire
had
been
packing
upstairs
she
had
had
time
to
realise
erskine
return
and
his
reception
of
the
news
she
would
have
to
break
as
she
drove
away
from
the
door
claire
realised
that
her
hostess
would
have
paid
a
large
sum
down
to
have
been
able
to
undo
that
morning
work
for
her
own
part
claire
cared
nothing
either
way
literally
and
truthfully
at
that
moment
even
the
thought
of
leaving
erskine
had
no
power
to
wound
the
events
of
the
last
hours
had
had
a
numbing
effect
on
her
brain
she
was
miserable
sore
and
wounded
the
whole
fabric
of
life
seemed
tumbling
to
pieces
love
for
the
moment
was
in
abeyance
as
the
fly
passed
the
last
yard
of
mown
grass
which
marked
the
boundary
of
the
fanshawe
property
she
threw
out
her
arms
with
one
of
the
expressive
gestures
which
remained
with
her
as
a
result
of
her
foreign
training
she
cried
aloud
mentally
at
that
moment
she
swept
the
fanshawes
mother
and
son
from
the
stage
of
her
life
where
should
she
go
next
back
to
solitude
and
the
saffron
parlour
london
in
august
held
no
attraction
but
the
solitary
prospect
of
being
able
to
see
sophie
and
at
the
moment
claire
shrank
from
sophie
sharp
eyes
should
she
telegraph
to
the
farm
and
ask
how
soon
she
could
be
received
and
at
the
same
time
telegraph
to
mary
rhodes
asking
for
an
immediate
interview
a
few
minutes
reflection
brought
a
decision
in
favour
of
this
plan
and
she
drew
a
from
her
and
busied
herself
in
composing
the
messages
one
to
the
farm
a
second
to
laburnum
crescent
announcing
her
immediate
return
then
came
a
pause
to
consider
the
difficult
wording
of
the
third
would
it
be
possible
to
drop
a
word
of
warning
intelligible
to
cecil
herself
but
meaningless
to
anyone
else
who
might
by
chance
open
the
wire
back
in
town
have
important
news
imperative
to
see
you
if
possible
appoint
meeting
delay
dangerous
it
was
not
perfect
but
in
claire
dazed
condition
it
was
the
best
she
could
concoct
and
it
left
a
tactful
uncertainty
as
to
whether
the
news
affected
herself
or
cecil
which
would
make
it
the
easier
to
explain
claire
counted
the
words
and
folded
the
three
messages
in
her
ready
to
be
sent
off
the
moment
she
reached
the
station
the
fly
lumbered
on
up
a
toilsome
hill
down
into
the
valley
up
another
hill
on
the
farther
side
then
came
a
scattering
of
houses
a
church
a
narrow
street
lined
with
shops
and
finally
the
station
itself
the
clock
over
the
entrance
showing
a
bare
four
minutes
to
spare
the
porter
labelled
the
luggage
and
trundled
it
down
the
platform
claire
hurried
through
her
business
in
the
telegraph
office
and
ran
after
him
just
as
the
train
slowed
down
on
the
departure
platform
one
carriage
showed
two
empty
corner
places
on
the
nearest
side
claire
opened
the
door
seated
herself
facing
the
engine
and
spread
her
impedimenta
on
the
cushions
but
few
passengers
had
been
waiting
for
this
was
one
of
the
slowest
trains
in
the
day
but
now
at
this
last
moment
there
came
the
sound
of
running
footsteps
a
man
footsteps
echoing
in
strong
heavy
beats
with
a
traveller
instinctive
curiosity
claire
leant
forward
to
watch
the
movements
of
this
late
comer
and
putting
her
head
out
of
the
window
came
face
to
face
with
erskine
fanshawe
himself
at
sight
of
her
he
stopped
short
at
sight
of
him
she
stood
up
blocking
the
window
from
sight
of
the
other
occupants
of
the
carriage
by
a
certain
defiance
of
pose
appearing
to
defend
it
also
against
his
own
entrance
but
he
did
not
attempt
to
enter
though
he
had
been
running
it
was
his
pallor
not
his
heat
which
struck
claire
in
that
first
moment
he
was
white
with
the
pallor
of
intense
anger
the
flash
of
his
eyes
was
like
cold
steel
he
rested
his
hands
on
the
sill
of
the
window
and
looked
up
into
her
face
this
is
my
mother
doing
it
was
a
statement
not
a
question
and
claire
made
no
reply
she
stood
stiff
and
silent
while
down
the
length
of
the
platform
sounded
the
quick
banging
of
doors
i
got
through
sooner
than
i
expected
and
went
home
to
change
i
did
not
waste
time
in
talking
i
could
guess
what
had
happened
she
made
it
impossible
for
you
to
stay
on
still
silence
the
guard
whistle
sounded
shrilly
erskine
came
a
step
nearer
his
white
tense
face
almost
touched
her
own
claire
he
whispered
breathlessly
will
you
marry
me
stand
back
there
stand
back
cried
an
authoritative
voice
the
wheels
of
the
carriage
rolled
slowly
forward
claire
bent
forward
and
gave
her
answer
in
one
incisive
word
no
the
wheels
rolled
faster
and
faster
left
the
station
whirled
out
into
the
green
smiling
plain
chapter
twenty
four
a
rupture
in
after
days
claire
often
looked
back
upon
that
journey
to
london
and
tried
to
recall
her
own
feelings
but
invariably
the
effort
ended
in
failure
she
could
remember
nothing
but
a
haze
of
general
misery
and
confusion
which
deepened
with
every
fresh
mile
and
reached
its
acutest
point
at
the
moment
of
arriving
home
the
landlady
was
flustered
at
having
to
prepare
for
so
hasty
a
return
and
did
not
scruple
to
show
her
displeasure
she
took
for
granted
that
claire
had
had
lunch
and
the
poor
girl
had
not
the
courage
to
undeceive
her
a
telegram
was
lying
on
the
table
which
announced
cecil
arrival
at
four
claire
ordered
tea
to
be
ready
at
that
hour
and
stretched
herself
on
her
bed
in
the
room
upstairs
which
looked
so
bare
and
cold
denuded
of
the
beautifying
personal
touches
she
felt
incredibly
tired
incredibly
lonely
she
longed
with
a
very
passion
of
longing
for
some
one
of
her
own
for
the
dear
beautiful
mother
who
if
she
did
not
always
understand
was
always
ready
to
love
oh
it
was
hard
unnatural
work
this
fighting
the
world
alone
did
the
girls
who
grew
weary
of
the
restraints
of
home
ever
realise
how
their
working
sisters
sickened
with
longing
for
some
one
who
cared
enough
even
to
three
three
a
quarter
to
four
claire
was
faint
for
want
of
food
and
had
enough
sense
to
realise
that
this
was
a
poor
preparation
for
the
ordeal
ahead
she
went
downstairs
and
threw
herself
upon
lizzie
mercy
lizzie
i
have
had
no
lunch
i
starving
could
you
bring
up
the
tea
and
make
some
fresh
for
miss
rhodes
when
she
arrives
why
could
you
say
so
before
lizzie
asked
with
the
freedom
of
the
slavey
but
the
question
was
spoken
in
sympathy
rather
than
anger
the
kettle
boiling
and
i
cut
the
bread
and
butter
you
shall
have
it
in
two
two
i
cut
you
a
sanguidge
she
cried
as
a
supreme
proof
of
goodwill
and
clattered
down
the
kitchen
stairs
at
express
speed
she
was
as
good
as
her
word
in
five
minutes
tea
was
ready
and
claire
ate
and
drank
keeping
her
eyes
turned
resolutely
from
the
clock
before
it
had
struck
the
hour
there
came
from
the
hall
the
sound
of
a
double
knock
and
she
knew
that
the
hour
of
her
ordeal
had
arrived
she
did
not
rise
from
the
table
the
were
clattering
with
the
trembling
of
the
hand
that
was
resting
upon
the
tray
she
literally
had
not
the
strength
to
rise
she
lay
back
in
her
chair
and
stared
helplessly
at
the
opening
door
cecil
came
in
it
came
as
a
shock
to
see
her
looking
so
natural
so
entirely
the
cecil
claire
was
accustomed
to
see
she
looked
tired
and
a
trifle
cross
but
alas
these
had
been
prevailing
expressions
even
in
the
days
when
things
were
going
comparatively
well
casual
in
her
own
manner
she
saw
nothing
unusual
in
claire
lack
of
welcome
she
nodded
an
greeting
and
drew
up
a
chair
to
the
table
well
i
come
give
me
a
cup
of
tea
as
a
start
i
had
a
rush
for
it
you
said
if
possible
and
i
had
nothing
special
on
hand
so
i
thought
i
had
better
come
what
the
news
and
what
the
danger
which
of
us
does
it
affect
me
or
you
oh
it
horrid
horrid
horrid
it
a
long
story
finish
your
tea
first
then
i
tell
you
i
miserable
poor
old
girl
cecil
said
kindly
and
helped
herself
to
bread
and
butter
claire
had
a
miserable
conviction
that
her
reply
had
had
a
deceptive
effect
and
that
the
shock
when
it
came
would
be
all
the
more
severe
nevertheless
she
was
thankful
for
the
reprieve
thankful
to
see
cecil
eat
sandwiches
with
honest
enjoyment
until
the
last
one
had
disappeared
from
the
plate
well
cecil
pushed
aside
her
cup
and
rested
an
arm
on
the
table
let
get
to
business
i
promised
mother
i
catch
the
six
train
back
what
it
all
about
some
young
squire
wanting
to
marry
you
and
you
want
my
advice
take
him
my
dear
you
wo
always
be
young
and
beautiful
claire
shook
her
head
nothing
about
me
i
would
have
worried
you
in
the
holidays
if
if
it
had
been
for
your
own
sake
the
red
flowed
into
cecil
cheeks
her
face
hardened
the
tone
of
her
voice
was
icy
cold
sake
i
do
understand
i
am
not
aware
that
you
have
any
responsibility
about
my
affairs
cecil
i
have
i
must
have
we
have
lived
together
i
have
loved
you
mary
rhodes
waved
aside
the
protestations
with
impatient
scorn
do
be
sentimental
please
you
are
not
one
of
the
girls
if
the
money
and
you
are
in
a
hurry
to
be
repaid
i
not
i
not
i
do
care
if
you
pay
tears
of
distress
rose
in
claire
eyes
she
caught
her
breath
and
cried
in
a
choking
sob
cecil
it
about
him
i
found
out
something
seen
him
only
last
night
i
thought
you
might
meet
as
his
camp
was
so
near
suppose
you
did
what
was
so
terribly
alarming
in
that
you
have
heard
he
has
been
to
see
you
or
written
or
wired
he
has
not
why
should
he
do
be
hysterical
claire
if
you
have
anything
to
say
say
it
and
let
me
hear
what
have
you
about
major
carew
he
major
carew
claire
cried
desperately
he
has
deceived
you
cecil
and
pretended
to
be
to
be
something
quite
different
from
what
he
really
is
there
a
real
major
carew
and
his
name
is
frank
and
he
has
a
home
in
surrey
and
an
invalid
father
everything
that
he
told
you
was
true
only
he
is
not
the
man
oh
cecil
how
shall
i
tell
you
it
so
dreadfully
dreadfully
hard
he
knew
all
about
the
real
major
carew
and
could
get
hold
of
photographs
to
show
you
because
he
he
is
his
servant
cecil
his
soldier
servant
he
was
with
him
in
camp
cecil
rose
from
her
chair
and
went
over
to
the
empty
fireplace
standing
with
her
back
to
her
companion
she
spoke
no
word
and
claire
struggled
on
painfully
with
her
explanations
he
the
real
major
carew
came
over
to
a
tennis
party
at
mrs
fanshawe
yesterday
i
thought
of
course
that
it
was
another
man
of
the
same
name
but
he
said
he
said
there
was
no
other
in
that
regiment
and
he
asked
me
to
tell
him
some
more
and
i
did
and
everything
i
said
amazed
him
more
and
more
for
it
was
true
about
then
he
asked
me
to
describe
the
man
and
he
made
an
excuse
to
send
his
servant
over
in
the
evening
so
that
i
should
see
him
he
came
oh
cecil
he
saw
me
and
he
ran
away
he
had
not
returned
this
morning
he
has
still
silence
it
seemed
to
claire
of
most
pitiful
import
that
cecil
made
no
disclaimer
that
at
the
word
of
a
stranger
she
accepted
her
lover
guilt
what
a
light
on
the
past
was
cast
by
that
stoney
silence
unbroken
by
a
solitary
protest
poor
mary
rhodes
had
known
no
doubts
as
to
the
man
identity
she
had
given
him
affection
and
help
but
respect
and
trust
could
never
have
entered
into
the
contract
claire
had
said
her
say
she
leant
her
elbows
on
the
table
and
buried
her
head
in
her
hands
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
ticked
steadily
for
an
endless
five
minutes
then
cecil
spoke
i
suppose
she
said
harshly
you
expect
me
to
be
grateful
for
this
the
sound
of
her
voice
was
like
a
blow
claire
looked
up
startled
protesting
oh
cecil
surely
you
would
rather
know
should
i
cecil
asked
slowly
should
i
she
turned
back
to
the
tireless
grate
and
her
thoughts
sped
with
her
eyes
opened
she
would
not
of
course
consent
to
marry
this
man
who
had
so
meanly
abused
her
trust
but
suppose
she
had
not
known
suppose
in
ignorance
the
marriage
had
taken
place
if
he
had
been
loving
if
he
had
been
kind
would
she
in
after
days
have
regretted
the
step
at
the
bottom
of
her
weary
woman
heart
cecil
answered
that
she
would
the
fraud
was
unpardonable
yet
she
could
have
pardoned
it
if
it
had
been
done
for
love
of
herself
no
stately
surrey
mansion
would
have
been
her
home
but
a
cottage
of
three
or
four
rooms
but
it
would
have
been
her
cottage
her
home
she
would
have
felt
pride
in
keeping
it
clean
and
bright
there
would
have
been
some
one
to
work
for
some
one
to
care
some
one
to
whom
she
and
suddenly
there
came
the
thought
of
another
joy
that
might
have
been
she
held
to
her
breast
a
child
that
was
no
paid
charge
but
her
very
own
bone
of
her
bone
flesh
of
her
flesh
no
no
she
cried
harshly
i
am
not
grateful
did
you
tell
me
why
did
you
spoil
it
what
do
i
care
who
he
was
he
was
my
man
he
wanted
me
he
told
lies
he
wanted
me
i
am
getting
old
and
i
tired
and
cross
but
he
he
care
and
he
looked
up
to
me
and
wanted
to
appear
my
equal
oh
i
not
excusing
him
i
know
all
you
would
say
he
deceived
me
he
borrowed
money
that
he
could
never
pay
back
but
he
would
have
confessed
some
day
he
would
have
had
to
confess
and
i
should
have
forgiven
him
i
have
forgiven
him
anything
he
cared
and
after
that
he
would
have
cared
more
i
should
have
had
him
i
should
have
had
my
home
claire
hid
her
face
and
groaned
in
misery
of
spirit
from
her
own
point
of
view
it
seemed
impossible
that
any
woman
should
regret
a
man
who
had
proved
so
unworthy
but
once
again
she
reminded
herself
that
her
own
working
life
counted
only
one
year
as
against
cecil
twelve
once
again
she
felt
she
had
no
right
to
judge
presently
she
became
aware
that
cecil
was
moving
about
the
room
opening
the
bureau
and
taking
papers
out
of
a
drawer
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
she
came
back
to
the
table
and
began
drawing
on
her
gloves
her
face
was
set
and
tearless
but
the
lines
had
deepened
into
a
new
distinctness
claire
had
a
pitiful
realisation
that
this
was
how
cecil
would
look
when
she
was
well
she
said
curtly
that
finished
i
may
as
well
go
for
my
train
i
sorry
to
appear
ungracious
but
you
could
hardly
expect
me
to
be
pleased
you
meant
well
of
course
but
it
a
pity
to
interfere
there
just
one
thing
i
like
to
make
clear
you
and
i
can
hardly
live
together
after
this
i
never
was
a
very
agreeable
companion
and
i
shall
be
worse
in
the
future
it
would
be
better
for
your
own
sake
to
make
a
fresh
start
and
for
myself
i
sorry
to
appear
brutal
but
i
could
not
stand
another
winter
together
it
would
remind
me
too
much
she
broke
off
abruptly
and
claire
burst
into
helpless
tears
oh
cecil
cecil
do
hate
me
do
blame
me
too
much
it
been
hard
on
me
too
do
you
think
i
breaking
such
news
of
course
i
will
take
fresh
rooms
i
can
understand
that
you
rather
have
some
one
else
but
let
us
still
be
friends
do
turn
against
me
altogether
i
lonely
too
i
got
my
own
trouble
poor
little
claire
cecil
melted
at
once
with
the
quick
response
which
always
rewarded
an
appeal
to
her
better
feelings
poor
little
claire
you
a
good
child
you
done
your
best
it
is
fault
she
lifted
her
bag
from
the
table
and
took
a
step
towards
the
door
then
resolutely
turned
back
and
held
out
her
hand
do
cry
what
the
good
of
crying
good
luck
to
you
my
dear
and
take
warning
by
me
i
do
know
what
your
trouble
is
but
as
it
money
it
probably
if
it
is
do
play
the
fool
if
the
chance
of
happiness
comes
along
do
throw
it
away
out
of
pride
or
obstinacy
or
foolish
prejudice
you
wo
always
be
young
when
you
get
past
thirty
it
it
hard
when
there
nothing
she
broke
off
again
and
walked
swiftly
from
the
room
the
next
moment
the
front
door
banged
loudly
cecil
had
gone
chapter
twenty
five
a
sudden
resolve
the
next
morning
brought
a
letter
from
the
farm
bidding
claire
welcome
as
soon
as
she
chose
to
arrive
but
there
was
no
second
letter
on
the
table
claire
had
not
realised
how
confidently
she
had
expected
its
presence
until
her
heart
sank
with
a
sick
heavy
faintness
as
she
lifted
the
one
envelope
and
looked
in
vain
for
a
second
erskine
had
not
written
did
that
mean
that
he
had
taken
her
hasty
answer
as
final
and
would
make
no
further
appeal
she
had
read
of
men
who
had
boasted
haughtily
that
no
girl
should
have
an
opportunity
of
refusing
them
that
the
woman
who
did
not
know
her
own
mind
was
no
wife
for
them
but
like
every
other
lover
she
felt
her
own
case
to
be
unique
driven
to
answer
in
a
moment
of
intolerable
irritation
what
else
could
she
have
said
but
he
had
not
written
what
did
that
mean
at
the
moment
of
discovering
her
departure
erskine
had
been
consumed
with
anger
but
afterwards
had
his
mother
counsels
prevailed
had
he
repented
himself
of
his
hasty
impulse
would
the
days
pass
on
and
the
months
and
the
years
and
leave
her
like
cecil
solitary
apart
claire
made
a
pretence
at
eating
her
breakfast
and
then
too
restless
to
stay
indoors
put
on
her
hat
and
went
out
to
roam
the
streets
until
it
should
be
time
to
visit
sophie
in
her
hospital
two
hours
later
she
returned
and
packed
up
not
only
her
entire
wardrobe
but
the
whole
of
her
personal
possessions
in
the
course
of
her
walk
there
had
come
to
her
one
of
those
curious
contradictory
impulses
which
are
so
characteristic
of
a
woman
nature
having
poured
out
her
heart
in
grief
because
erskine
had
neither
written
nor
followed
her
to
town
she
was
now
restlessly
impatient
to
make
communication
impossible
and
to
bury
herself
where
she
could
not
be
found
before
leaving
the
house
she
made
lizzie
happy
by
a
present
of
money
accompanied
by
quite
a
goodly
bundle
of
clothing
after
which
she
interviewed
the
landlady
gave
notice
that
she
no
longer
needed
the
rooms
and
wrote
out
a
cheque
in
payment
of
all
claims
then
a
taxi
was
summoned
the
various
boxes
piled
on
top
and
another
chapter
of
life
had
come
to
an
end
claire
drove
to
the
station
whence
she
proposed
to
take
a
late
afternoon
train
to
the
farm
deposited
her
boxes
in
the
left
luggage
office
and
strolled
listlessly
towards
the
great
bookstall
under
the
clock
another
hour
remained
to
be
whiled
away
before
she
could
start
for
the
hospital
she
would
buy
a
book
sit
in
the
and
try
to
bury
herself
in
its
pages
she
strolled
slowly
down
the
length
of
the
stall
her
eyes
passing
listlessly
from
one
pile
of
books
to
another
finding
little
interest
in
them
and
even
less
in
the
men
and
women
who
stood
by
her
side
as
mrs
fanshawe
would
have
said
no
one
was
in
town
even
had
flown
from
the
region
of
bricks
and
mortar
if
she
had
thought
about
it
at
all
claire
would
have
said
that
there
was
no
one
she
meet
but
suddenly
a
hand
grasped
her
arm
and
brought
her
to
a
halt
she
started
violently
and
for
an
instant
her
heart
leapt
with
a
wild
glad
hope
it
was
not
erskine
fanshawe
who
confronted
her
however
but
a
girl
clad
in
a
tweed
costume
with
a
cloth
cap
to
match
on
the
side
of
which
a
sprig
of
heather
was
fastened
by
a
gold
brooch
fashioned
in
the
shape
of
a
thistle
in
bewildered
surprise
claire
recognised
the
brown
eyes
and
round
freckled
face
of
janet
willoughby
whom
she
had
believed
to
be
hundreds
of
miles
away
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
just
come
back
janet
explained
the
weather
was
impossible
nothing
but
sheets
of
rain
i
got
tired
and
came
back
to
pay
some
visits
in
the
south
she
hesitated
then
asked
a
sudden
question
are
you
busy
going
anywhere
at
once
could
you
spare
half
an
hour
we
might
have
lunch
together
in
the
refreshment
room
yes
no
i
like
to
i
had
no
lunch
claire
faltered
nervously
whereupon
janet
turned
to
her
maid
who
was
standing
near
in
hand
and
gave
a
few
quick
instructions
get
a
taxi
ross
and
take
all
the
things
home
the
car
can
wait
for
me
i
follow
later
the
maid
disappeared
and
the
two
girls
made
their
way
across
the
open
space
both
looked
nervous
and
ill
at
ease
both
dreaded
the
coming
yet
felt
that
it
was
a
thing
to
be
faced
janet
led
the
way
to
a
table
in
the
farthest
corner
of
the
room
and
they
talked
trivialities
until
the
ordered
dishes
were
set
on
the
table
and
the
waiter
had
taken
his
departure
claire
had
ordered
coffee
and
drank
eagerly
hoping
that
the
physical
refreshment
would
help
to
steady
her
nerves
janet
played
with
her
knife
and
fork
and
said
without
looking
up
you
have
left
the
fanshawes
then
i
heard
that
you
were
staying
on
yes
yesterday
i
came
back
the
very
lameness
of
the
answer
made
it
significant
janet
freckled
face
turned
noticeably
pale
erskine
went
straight
home
after
he
left
scotland
yes
and
before
he
arrived
you
had
promised
to
stay
on
mrs
fanshawe
asked
me
before
he
came
if
i
could
stay
for
another
week
and
i
was
very
glad
to
accept
i
had
no
other
engagement
and
then
oh
then
things
were
different
she
did
need
company
and
and
things
happened
my
friend
miss
rhodes
janet
waved
aside
my
friend
miss
rhodes
with
an
impatient
hand
and
erskine
what
did
say
to
your
leaving
the
colour
flamed
in
claire
cheek
she
stammered
in
hopeless
confusion
and
in
the
midst
of
her
stammering
janet
laid
both
hands
on
the
table
and
leaning
forward
so
that
the
two
faces
were
only
a
few
inches
apart
spoke
a
few
startling
words
has
he
to
you
i
must
know
you
must
tell
me
it
was
a
command
rather
than
an
appeal
and
claire
automatically
replied
he
he
did
yes
but
and
you
i
could
i
said
no
you
said
no
erskine
asked
you
to
be
his
wife
and
you
janet
stared
in
incredulous
bewilderment
a
spark
of
indignation
shone
in
her
brown
eyes
but
why
you
care
for
him
any
girl
might
be
proud
to
marry
erskine
fanshawe
i
ca
tell
you
it
so
difficult
his
mother
she
did
want
me
she
would
have
hated
it
she
almost
turned
me
out
his
mrs
fanshawe
janet
voice
was
full
of
an
ineffable
surprise
you
refused
erskine
because
of
prejudice
but
she
is
always
changing
she
is
the
most
undependable
woman
on
the
face
of
the
earth
she
is
charming
and
i
fond
of
her
but
i
should
not
take
her
advice
about
a
pair
of
gloves
nothing
that
she
could
say
would
possibly
have
the
slightest
influence
on
my
life
she
irresponsible
she
sees
entirely
from
her
own
standpoint
and
erskine
erskine
is
a
rock
she
paused
pressing
her
lips
together
to
still
their
trembling
and
claire
answered
with
a
note
of
apology
in
her
voice
janet
i
do
think
i
do
appreciate
him
wait
till
you
hear
how
it
happened
he
followed
me
to
the
station
it
was
the
very
last
moment
just
as
the
train
was
starting
there
was
time
for
only
one
word
and
i
was
sore
and
angry
janet
looked
at
her
a
long
searching
look
it
curious
but
i
always
knew
this
would
come
when
i
saw
you
sitting
together
at
supper
that
first
night
i
knew
then
all
the
time
i
knew
it
in
my
heart
but
on
the
surface
it
seemed
ridiculous
for
you
never
met
never
that
you
did
not
know
except
one
time
in
the
park
there
was
nothing
to
tell
you
janet
nothing
to
hide
no
so
he
said
we
talked
of
you
in
scotland
you
know
and
it
was
just
as
i
thought
a
case
of
recognising
each
other
at
first
sight
he
said
the
moment
he
saw
you
you
seemed
different
from
everyone
else
and
he
hoped
and
believed
that
you
felt
the
same
that
is
how
people
ought
to
love
the
right
way
when
both
are
attached
both
feel
the
same
and
it
is
so
rare
yet
you
would
you
marry
a
man
if
his
family
disapproved
oh
yes
i
should
not
be
marrying
the
family
i
be
sorry
of
course
but
i
make
up
my
mind
that
in
time
i
make
them
fall
in
love
with
me
too
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
going
away
into
the
country
i
want
to
be
quiet
and
think
janet
did
not
ask
the
address
she
sat
silent
staring
into
space
then
asked
a
sudden
irrelevant
question
did
he
send
you
the
cuckoo
clock
i
think
so
it
had
no
name
but
it
came
from
switzerland
while
he
was
there
he
has
never
referred
to
it
since
ah
janet
began
pulling
on
her
gloves
i
knew
that
too
i
that
he
had
sent
it
well
i
must
go
it
will
all
come
right
of
course
and
you
will
be
very
happy
i
known
erskine
so
long
and
his
wife
is
sure
to
be
happy
janet
forced
an
artificial
little
laugh
you
will
be
engaged
before
me
after
all
but
i
dare
say
i
shall
soon
follow
suit
it
nice
to
be
loved
as
one
grows
older
one
appreciates
it
more
and
captain
humphreys
is
a
good
man
he
is
splendid
i
loved
his
face
and
he
is
so
devoted
to
you
it
was
quite
beautiful
to
watch
him
cried
claire
thankful
from
her
heart
to
be
able
to
enthuse
honestly
a
load
was
lifted
from
her
heart
by
janet
prophecy
of
her
own
future
for
the
moment
it
had
no
doubt
been
made
more
out
of
bravado
than
any
real
conviction
and
inevitably
there
must
be
a
period
of
suffering
but
janet
was
of
a
naturally
buoyant
nature
and
her
wounded
spirit
would
gradually
find
consolation
in
the
love
which
had
waited
so
patiently
for
its
reward
it
needed
no
great
gift
of
prophecy
to
see
her
in
the
future
a
happy
contented
wife
chapter
twenty
six
easier
to
die
when
janet
had
taken
her
departure
claire
looked
at
the
clock
and
found
that
it
was
time
to
start
for
the
hospital
she
went
out
of
the
station
and
passing
a
shop
for
flowers
and
fruit
went
in
spent
ten
shillings
in
the
filling
of
a
reed
basket
and
leaving
the
shop
seated
herself
in
one
of
the
taxis
which
were
standing
in
readiness
outside
the
great
porch
such
carelessness
of
money
was
a
natural
reversion
to
habit
which
came
as
a
consequence
of
her
absorbed
mind
the
great
hospital
looked
bare
and
grim
the
smell
of
iodoform
was
more
repellent
than
ever
after
the
sweet
scents
of
the
country
claire
knew
her
way
by
this
time
and
ascended
by
lift
to
the
women
ward
where
sophie
lay
beside
almost
every
bed
one
or
two
visitors
were
seated
but
sophie
was
alone
down
the
length
of
the
ward
claire
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
recumbent
form
and
felt
a
pang
at
the
thought
of
the
many
visiting
days
when
her
friend
had
remained
alone
with
no
relations
in
town
her
brother
family
too
pressed
for
means
to
afford
expeditions
from
the
country
sophie
had
no
hope
of
seeing
a
familiar
face
and
her
very
attitude
bespoke
dejection
claire
walked
softly
to
the
further
side
of
the
bed
and
dangled
the
basket
before
the
face
whereupon
sophie
pushed
back
the
clothes
and
sat
up
her
eyes
lighting
with
joy
you
oh
you
dearly
beloved
i
thought
you
were
still
away
oh
i
am
glad
i
am
glad
i
was
so
dreadfully
blue
she
looked
it
even
in
the
eagerness
of
welcome
her
face
looked
white
and
drawn
and
the
pretty
pink
jacket
claire
own
gift
seemed
to
accentuate
her
pallor
the
hands
with
which
she
fondled
the
flowers
were
surely
thinner
than
they
had
been
ten
days
before
my
dear
what
munificence
have
you
come
into
a
fortune
and
fruit
underneath
i
shall
be
able
to
treat
the
whole
ward
when
did
you
come
back
have
you
had
a
good
time
are
you
going
on
to
the
farm
it
good
of
you
to
come
again
it
it
hard
being
alone
when
you
see
the
other
patients
with
their
own
people
the
nurses
are
dears
but
they
are
so
rushed
poor
things
they
have
time
to
stay
and
talk
and
oh
claire
the
days
they
so
wearily
claire
murmured
tender
exclamations
of
understanding
and
pity
a
pained
conviction
that
sophie
was
no
better
made
her
shrink
from
putting
the
obvious
question
but
sophie
did
not
wait
to
be
asked
oh
claire
she
cried
desperately
it
so
hard
to
be
patient
and
to
keep
on
hoping
when
there
no
encouragement
to
hope
i
not
one
scrap
better
after
all
that
has
been
tried
and
i
discovered
that
they
did
not
expect
me
to
be
better
the
best
they
seem
to
hope
for
is
that
i
may
not
grow
worse
it
like
running
at
the
pitch
of
speed
and
succeeding
only
in
keeping
in
the
same
place
and
there
are
other
arthritics
in
this
ward
she
shuddered
when
i
think
that
i
may
become
like
it
would
be
much
easier
to
die
i
think
it
would
often
seem
easier
claire
agreed
sadly
her
thoughts
turning
to
cecil
whose
trouble
at
the
moment
seemed
as
heavy
as
the
one
before
her
but
we
ca
be
deserters
sophie
we
must
stick
to
our
posts
and
play
the
game
when
these
troubles
come
we
just
to
bear
them
there
no
hiding
or
running
away
there
only
one
choice
open
to
us
whether
we
bear
it
badly
or
well
but
sophie
endurance
was
broken
by
weeks
of
suffering
and
her
bright
spirit
was
momentarily
under
an
eclipse
everybody
does
have
to
bear
them
things
are
so
horribly
uneven
she
cried
grudgingly
look
at
your
friend
miss
willoughby
with
that
angel
of
a
mother
and
heaps
of
money
and
health
and
strength
and
a
beautiful
home
and
able
to
have
anything
she
wants
as
soon
as
she
wants
it
what
does
know
of
trouble
claire
thought
of
janet
face
as
it
had
faced
her
across
the
table
in
the
refreshment
room
but
it
was
not
for
her
to
betray
another
secret
so
she
was
silent
and
sophie
lifted
a
spray
of
pink
roses
and
held
them
against
her
face
saying
wistfully
you
a
good
little
soul
claire
and
it
because
you
are
good
that
i
want
to
know
what
your
opinion
is
about
all
this
trouble
and
misery
what
good
can
it
possibly
do
me
to
have
my
life
ruined
by
this
illness
do
tell
me
that
it
will
not
be
ruined
it
must
be
in
a
material
sense
and
i
not
all
spiritual
yet
there
a
lot
of
material
in
my
nature
and
i
live
in
a
material
world
and
i
want
to
be
able
to
enjoy
all
the
dear
sweet
natural
human
joys
which
come
as
a
right
to
ordinary
human
beings
i
want
to
oh
my
dear
i
look
out
of
these
windows
sometimes
and
see
all
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
passing
by
and
i
wonder
if
a
single
one
out
of
all
the
crowd
ever
thinks
of
being
thankful
that
he
can
i
did
myself
but
now
when
i
hobble
along
she
broke
off
shaking
back
her
head
as
though
to
defy
the
rising
tears
then
lay
back
against
the
pillows
looking
at
claire
and
saying
urgently
go
on
tell
me
what
you
think
i
think
claire
answered
slowly
that
we
are
bound
to
grow
the
mere
act
of
death
is
not
going
to
lift
us
at
once
to
our
full
height
our
training
must
go
on
after
we
leave
this
sphere
but
sophie
dear
some
of
us
have
an
extra
hard
training
here
and
if
we
bear
it
in
the
right
way
surely
surely
when
we
move
up
it
must
be
into
a
higher
class
than
if
things
had
been
all
smooth
and
easy
there
must
be
less
to
learn
less
to
conquer
more
to
enjoy
you
and
i
are
and
ought
to
realise
the
difficulties
of
mastering
difficult
tasks
look
upon
this
illness
as
cheating
you
out
of
a
pleasant
holiday
dear
look
upon
it
as
special
training
for
an
honours
sophie
smiled
her
old
twinkling
smile
and
stroked
claire
hand
with
the
spray
of
roses
i
knew
you
say
something
nice
i
knew
you
put
it
in
a
quaint
refreshing
way
i
shall
remember
that
when
i
am
alone
and
feel
courage
oozing
out
of
every
pore
two
in
the
morning
is
a
particularly
cheery
time
when
you
are
racked
with
pain
claire
i
asked
the
doctor
to
tell
me
honestly
whether
there
was
any
chance
of
my
ever
taking
up
the
old
work
again
and
he
said
honestly
he
feared
there
was
none
but
mrs
willoughby
i
asked
that
too
he
says
he
quite
hopes
to
get
me
well
enough
to
go
to
egypt
in
october
or
november
and
that
i
should
certainly
be
much
better
there
it
would
be
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
if
it
came
off
but
claire
held
up
a
protesting
hand
no
ifs
no
buts
do
your
part
and
get
better
and
leave
the
rest
to
providence
and
mrs
willoughby
it
her
mission
in
life
to
help
girls
and
she
help
too
or
know
the
reason
why
the
truly
sensible
thing
would
be
for
you
to
begin
to
prepare
your
clothes
what
about
starting
a
fascinating
blouse
at
once
your
hands
are
quite
able
to
sew
and
if
you
once
got
to
work
with
chiffon
and
lace
the
time
would
fly
you
might
write
for
patterns
you
would
enjoy
looking
at
patterns
when
claire
took
her
departure
half
an
hour
later
she
left
behind
a
very
different
sophie
from
the
wan
creature
whom
she
had
found
on
her
arrival
hers
was
a
happy
nature
easily
cheered
responsive
to
comfort
and
claire
had
a
happy
conviction
that
whatever
physical
handicaps
might
be
in
store
her
spirit
would
rise
valiantly
to
the
rescue
a
winter
in
egypt
was
practically
assured
since
mrs
willoughby
had
privately
informed
claire
that
if
nothing
better
offered
she
would
send
sophie
at
her
own
expense
to
help
in
the
household
of
her
niece
an
wife
who
would
be
thankful
for
assistance
though
she
could
not
afford
to
pay
the
passage
out
what
was
to
happen
in
the
future
no
one
could
tell
and
there
was
no
profit
in
asking
the
question
the
next
step
was
clear
and
the
rest
must
be
left
to
faith
but
with
a
chilling
of
the
blood
claire
asked
herself
what
became
of
the
disabled
working
women
who
had
no
influential
friends
to
help
in
such
a
crisis
the
women
who
fell
out
of
the
ranks
to
die
by
the
roadside
homeless
penniless
chapter
twenty
seven
surrender
it
was
a
very
limp
and
exhausted
claire
who
arrived
at
the
farm
that
evening
and
if
she
had
had
her
own
way
she
would
have
hurried
to
bed
without
waiting
for
a
meal
but
the
kind
countrywoman
displayed
such
disappointment
at
the
idea
that
she
allowed
herself
to
be
dissuaded
sat
down
to
a
table
spread
with
dainties
and
discovered
that
she
was
hungrier
than
she
had
believed
the
fried
ham
and
eggs
the
fresh
butter
the
thick
yellow
cream
the
sweet
coarse
bread
were
all
the
best
of
their
kind
and
claire
smiled
at
her
own
expense
as
she
looked
at
the
emptied
dishes
and
reflected
that
for
a
person
who
had
professed
herself
unable
to
eat
a
bite
she
had
made
a
pretty
good
sweep
the
bed
was
somewhat
bumpy
as
farmhouse
beds
have
a
habit
of
being
there
was
one
big
ball
in
especial
which
took
many
wrigglings
to
avoid
but
on
the
other
hand
the
sheets
smelt
deliciously
not
of
lavender
but
of
lemon
thyme
and
the
prevailing
air
of
cleanliness
was
delicious
after
the
atmosphere
of
town
claire
told
herself
that
she
could
not
expect
to
sleep
she
resigned
herself
to
hear
the
clock
strike
every
hour
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
after
ten
she
was
unconscious
of
the
whole
world
until
her
was
carried
into
the
room
next
morning
after
breakfast
she
had
another
nap
and
after
lunch
still
another
and
in
the
intervals
wandered
about
the
laboriously
striving
to
take
an
interest
in
what
really
interested
her
not
at
all
hens
seemed
to
her
the
dullest
of
created
creatures
pigs
repelled
cows
were
regarded
with
uneasy
suspicion
and
sheep
seen
close
at
hand
lost
all
the
picturesque
quality
of
a
distant
flock
and
became
stupid
creatures
by
no
means
as
clean
as
they
might
be
aroused
no
ambition
to
experiment
on
her
own
account
and
a
glass
of
foaming
new
milk
proved
unexpectedly
nauseous
sad
as
it
was
to
confess
it
she
infinitely
preferred
the
chalked
and
watered
edition
of
the
city
indoors
things
were
no
better
for
the
tiny
stood
by
itself
at
the
end
of
a
passage
cut
off
from
the
life
of
the
house
it
was
spotlessly
clean
and
the
pride
of
its
owner
heart
but
contained
nothing
of
interest
to
an
outsider
pictures
there
were
none
with
the
exception
of
portraits
of
the
farmer
and
his
wife
of
the
enlarged
photograph
type
and
a
selection
of
framed
funeral
cards
in
a
corner
books
there
were
none
with
the
exception
of
a
catalogue
of
an
agricultural
show
and
a
school
prize
copy
of
before
the
second
night
was
over
claire
had
read
from
cover
to
cover
the
next
morning
she
was
dipping
into
the
catalogue
and
trying
to
concentrate
her
attention
on
stock
as
her
body
grew
rested
claire
mind
became
increasingly
active
it
was
inevitable
but
the
second
stage
was
infinitely
harder
to
bear
for
the
first
hours
after
her
arrival
her
supreme
longing
had
been
to
lie
down
and
shut
her
eyes
but
now
restlessness
overtook
her
and
with
every
fresh
hour
drove
her
more
helplessly
to
and
fro
she
went
out
for
long
walks
over
the
countryside
her
thoughts
so
engrossingly
turned
inward
that
she
saw
nothing
of
the
landscape
on
either
hand
she
returned
to
the
house
and
endeavoured
to
write
to
read
to
sew
only
to
give
up
the
attempt
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
and
once
more
wander
helplessly
forth
the
good
countrywoman
was
quick
to
sense
that
some
hidden
trouble
was
preying
on
her
guest
and
showed
her
sympathy
in
practical
fashion
a
bit
are
you
i
seed
from
the
first
that
you
was
she
said
standing
tray
in
hand
on
the
threshold
of
the
little
parlour
her
fresh
face
smiling
kindly
upon
the
pale
girl
i
always
do
say
that
i
pities
ladies
when
they
has
anything
on
their
minds
sitting
about
same
as
you
do
now
with
nothing
to
take
them
off
theirselves
a
body
like
me
that
has
to
keep
a
house
clean
and
cook
and
wash
and
mind
the
children
to
say
naught
of
the
sewing
and
the
mending
and
looking
after
the
cows
and
the
hens
and
all
the
extra
fusses
and
worries
that
come
along
she
has
got
no
time
to
remember
herself
and
when
she
gets
to
bed
she
too
tired
to
think
now
if
you
was
to
have
some
work
claire
face
brightened
with
a
sudden
inspiration
will
you
give
me
some
work
let
me
help
do
please
mrs
corby
i
be
so
grateful
let
me
come
into
the
kitchen
and
do
something
now
i
feel
so
lonely
shut
off
here
all
by
myself
mrs
corby
laughed
her
fat
comfortable
laugh
bless
your
you
can
come
along
and
welcome
i
be
proud
to
have
you
it
ai
much
you
know
of
housework
i
expect
but
it
do
you
no
harm
to
learn
i
find
you
some
little
jobs
oh
i
not
so
useless
as
you
think
i
can
brush
and
dust
and
polish
and
wash
up
and
i
know
a
good
deal
about
cooking
i
make
a
salad
to
eat
with
the
cold
meat
a
real
french
salad
i
sure
mr
corby
would
enjoy
a
french
salad
cried
claire
glancing
out
of
the
window
at
the
kitchen
garden
and
thinking
of
the
wet
lettuce
and
uncut
onions
which
were
the
good
woman
idea
of
the
dish
in
question
may
i
make
one
mrs
corby
smiled
with
a
fine
resignation
personally
she
wanted
none
of
them
nasty
messy
foods
but
there
the
poor
thing
meant
well
and
if
it
would
make
her
happy
let
her
have
her
way
so
claire
collected
her
materials
and
washed
and
mixed
and
filled
a
great
bowl
and
decorated
the
top
with
slices
of
hardboiled
eggs
and
a
few
bright
nasturtium
blossoms
while
three
children
stood
by
watching
with
fascinated
attention
at
dinner
claire
thoroughly
enjoyed
her
share
of
her
own
salad
but
the
verdict
of
the
was
far
from
enthusiastic
i
do
go
for
to
deny
that
it
tasted
well
enough
mrs
corby
said
with
magnanimous
candour
but
what
i
argue
is
what
the
sense
of
using
up
all
them
extras
eggs
and
oil
and
what
not
when
you
can
manage
just
as
well
without
i
never
seen
the
day
when
i
relish
a
bit
o
plain
lettuce
and
a
plate
of
good
spring
onions
but
the
eggs
and
the
dressing
make
it
more
nourishing
claire
maintained
in
france
the
peasants
have
very
often
nothing
but
salad
for
their
dinner
great
dishes
of
salad
with
plenty
of
eggs
eh
poor
creatures
it
makes
your
heart
bleed
to
think
of
it
we
may
be
thankful
we
are
not
foreign
born
mrs
corby
pronounced
with
unction
and
claire
retired
from
the
struggle
and
decided
that
for
the
future
it
would
be
more
tactful
to
learn
rather
than
to
endeavour
to
teach
the
next
morning
therefore
she
worked
under
mrs
supervision
picking
fruit
feeding
chickens
searching
for
eggs
and
other
light
tasks
designed
to
keep
her
in
the
open
air
and
in
the
afternoon
accompanied
the
children
on
a
message
to
a
farm
some
distance
away
the
path
lay
across
the
fields
away
from
the
main
road
and
on
returning
an
hour
later
mrs
corby
figure
was
seen
standing
by
her
own
gate
her
hand
raised
to
her
eyes
as
though
watching
for
their
approach
the
children
broke
into
a
run
and
claire
hurried
forward
her
heart
beating
with
deep
excited
throbs
what
was
it
was
it
nobody
but
sophie
and
cecil
knew
her
address
but
still
but
still
for
a
moment
hope
soared
then
sank
heavily
down
as
mrs
corby
announced
a
lady
miss
come
to
see
you
almost
as
soon
as
you
left
waiting
in
the
parlour
cecil
claire
hardly
knew
if
she
were
sorry
or
relieved
it
would
be
a
blessing
to
have
some
one
to
whom
she
could
speak
but
on
the
other
hand
what
poor
cecil
had
to
say
would
not
fail
to
be
depressing
she
went
slowly
down
the
passage
taking
a
grip
over
her
own
courage
opened
the
door
and
stood
transfixed
in
the
middle
of
the
hard
horsehair
sofa
sat
mrs
fanshawe
herself
her
elaborately
coiffured
elaborately
attired
figure
looking
extraordinarily
out
of
place
in
the
prim
bareness
of
the
little
room
her
gloved
hands
were
crossed
on
her
lap
she
sat
ostentatiously
erect
her
satin
cloak
falling
around
her
in
regal
folds
her
face
was
a
trifle
paler
than
usual
but
the
mocking
light
shone
in
her
eyes
at
entrance
she
stood
up
and
crossed
the
little
room
to
her
side
my
dear
she
said
calmly
i
am
an
obstinate
old
woman
but
i
have
the
sense
to
know
when
i
beaten
i
have
come
to
offer
my
apologies
a
generous
heart
is
quick
to
forgive
at
that
moment
claire
felt
a
pang
indeed
but
it
came
not
from
the
remembrance
of
her
own
wrongs
but
from
the
sight
of
this
proud
domineering
woman
humbling
herself
to
a
girl
impulsively
she
threw
out
both
hands
impulsively
she
stopped
mrs
fanshawe
lips
with
the
kiss
which
she
had
refused
at
parting
oh
stop
please
do
do
say
any
more
i
was
wrong
too
i
took
offence
too
quickly
you
were
thinking
of
me
as
well
as
of
yourself
oh
no
i
was
not
the
elder
woman
corrected
quietly
neither
of
you
nor
your
friend
my
dear
though
i
took
advantage
of
the
excuse
you
came
between
me
and
my
plans
and
i
wanted
to
get
you
out
of
the
way
you
saw
through
me
and
i
suppose
i
deserved
to
be
seen
through
it
an
unpleasant
experience
but
if
it
any
satisfaction
to
you
to
know
it
i
been
punished
for
interfering
erskine
has
seen
to
my
punishment
the
blood
rushed
to
claire
face
how
much
did
mrs
fanshawe
know
had
erskine
told
her
of
that
hurried
interview
upon
the
station
had
he
by
any
possibility
told
what
he
had
the
blazing
cheeks
asked
the
question
as
plainly
as
any
words
and
mrs
fanshawe
replied
to
it
without
delay
oh
yes
my
dear
i
know
all
about
it
it
was
because
i
guessed
that
was
coming
that
i
wanted
to
clear
the
coast
but
it
appears
that
i
was
too
late
shall
we
sit
down
and
talk
this
out
and
for
pity
sake
see
that
that
woman
does
come
blundering
in
it
such
an
to
have
to
deal
with
a
in
the
midst
of
personal
explanations
not
accustomed
to
eating
humble
pie
and
if
i
am
obliged
to
do
it
at
all
i
prefer
to
do
it
in
private
she
wo
come
i
do
have
tea
for
another
hour
claire
assured
her
and
please
do
eat
humble
pie
for
me
i
was
angry
at
the
time
but
you
had
been
very
kind
to
me
before
i
i
enjoyed
that
first
week
very
much
and
so
did
i
mrs
fanshawe
gave
one
of
her
dry
humorous
little
laughs
you
are
a
charming
companion
my
dear
i
was
a
little
in
love
with
you
myself
but
well
to
be
honest
it
did
not
please
me
that
my
son
should
follow
my
example
he
is
my
only
child
and
i
am
proud
and
ambitious
for
him
as
any
mother
would
be
i
did
not
wish
him
to
marry
a
a
a
gentlewoman
who
was
honourably
working
at
an
honourable
profession
concluded
claire
for
her
with
a
general
stiffening
of
pose
voice
and
manner
but
mrs
fanshawe
only
laughed
once
more
totally
unaffected
by
the
pose
no
my
dear
i
did
not
it
very
praiseworthy
no
doubt
to
train
the
next
generation
but
it
does
appeal
to
me
in
the
present
connection
i
was
thinking
of
my
son
and
i
wanted
him
to
have
a
wife
of
position
and
fortune
who
would
be
able
to
help
his
career
if
you
had
been
a
girl
of
fortune
and
position
i
should
have
been
quite
ready
to
welcome
you
you
are
a
pretty
creature
and
much
more
intelligent
than
most
girls
of
your
age
but
you
see
you
are
not
i
have
no
money
but
what
i
earn
but
i
belong
to
a
good
family
i
object
to
your
saying
that
i
have
no
position
mrs
fanshawe
simply
because
i
live
in
lodgings
and
work
for
my
living
mrs
fanshawe
shrugged
with
a
touch
of
impatience
oh
well
my
dear
why
bandy
words
i
have
told
you
that
i
am
beaten
so
it
useless
to
argue
the
point
erskine
has
decided
for
himself
and
as
i
told
you
before
one
might
as
well
try
to
bend
a
granite
wall
as
move
him
when
he
has
once
made
up
his
mind
i
planned
and
schemed
and
hoped
and
prayed
for
the
last
dozen
years
and
at
the
first
sight
of
that
pretty
face
of
yours
all
my
plans
went
to
the
wall
if
i
been
a
wise
woman
i
would
have
recognised
the
inevitable
and
given
in
with
a
good
grace
but
i
never
was
wise
never
shall
be
so
i
ran
my
head
up
against
the
wall
i
been
through
a
bad
time
since
you
left
me
my
dear
and
i
was
forgiven
only
on
the
understanding
that
i
came
here
and
made
my
peace
with
you
have
i
made
peace
do
you
understand
what
i
mean
that
i
withdraw
my
opposition
and
if
you
accept
my
boy
you
shall
have
nothing
to
fear
i
make
you
welcome
and
i
be
as
good
to
you
as
it
in
my
nature
to
be
i
treat
you
with
every
courtesy
upon
my
word
my
dear
as
go
i
think
you
would
come
off
pretty
well
i
i
i
sure
you
very
kind
claire
stammered
in
helpless
embarrassment
and
mrs
fanshawe
watching
her
first
smiled
then
sighed
and
said
in
a
quick
low
voice
ah
my
dear
you
can
afford
to
be
generous
if
you
live
to
be
my
age
and
have
a
son
of
your
own
whom
you
have
loved
and
cherished
and
mothered
for
over
thirty
years
and
at
the
end
he
speaks
harshly
to
you
for
the
sake
of
a
girl
whom
he
has
known
a
few
short
months
puts
her
before
you
finds
it
hard
to
forgive
you
because
you
have
wounded
her
pride
ah
well
it
hard
to
bear
i
do
want
to
whine
but
make
it
more
difficult
for
me
than
you
can
help
i
have
apologised
now
it
for
you
claire
put
both
arms
round
the
erect
figure
and
rested
her
head
on
the
folds
of
the
black
satin
cloak
neither
spoke
but
mrs
fanshawe
lifted
a
little
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
and
her
shoulders
heaved
once
and
again
then
suddenly
she
arose
and
walked
towards
the
door
the
car
is
waiting
do
come
with
me
my
dear
i
see
you
again
she
waived
claire
back
in
the
old
imperious
way
against
which
there
was
no
appeal
evidently
she
wished
to
be
alone
and
claire
herself
on
the
sofa
flushed
trembling
so
shaken
out
of
her
bearings
that
it
was
difficult
to
keep
hold
of
connected
thought
the
impossible
had
happened
in
the
course
of
a
few
short
minutes
difficulties
which
had
seemed
insurmountable
had
been
swept
from
her
path
within
her
grasp
was
happiness
so
great
so
dazzling
that
the
very
thought
of
it
took
away
her
breath
her
eyes
fell
on
the
watch
at
her
wrist
ten
minutes
to
four
twenty
minutes
ago
barely
twenty
minutes
at
the
end
of
the
field
path
she
had
looked
at
that
little
gold
face
with
a
dreamy
indifference
wondering
only
how
many
minutes
remained
to
be
whiled
away
before
it
was
time
for
tea
even
a
solitary
had
seemed
an
epoch
in
the
uneventful
day
uneventful
claire
mentally
repeated
the
word
the
while
her
eyes
glowed
and
her
heart
beat
in
joyful
exultation
surely
surely
in
this
day
would
stand
out
as
one
making
and
then
suddenly
came
a
breathless
question
how
had
mrs
fanshawe
discovered
her
retreat
no
address
had
been
left
at
laburnum
crescent
no
address
had
been
given
to
janet
willoughby
cecil
was
in
her
mother
home
sophie
in
hospital
in
the
name
of
all
that
was
mysterious
and
inexplicable
had
she
been
claire
sat
bolt
upright
on
her
sofa
her
grey
eyes
widened
in
amaze
her
breath
coming
sharply
through
her
parted
lips
she
thrilled
at
the
realisation
that
erskine
will
had
overcome
all
difficulties
had
not
mrs
fanshawe
declared
that
she
came
at
his
instigation
and
where
the
mother
had
come
would
not
the
son
follow
at
that
moment
a
shadow
fell
across
the
floor
against
the
open
space
of
the
window
a
tall
figure
stood
blocking
the
light
erskine
eager
eyes
met
her
own
before
the
first
gasp
of
surprise
had
left
her
lips
his
strong
hands
had
gripped
the
sill
he
had
vaulted
over
and
stood
by
her
side
i
sent
on
my
advance
guard
and
waited
till
her
return
did
you
think
you
had
hidden
yourself
where
i
could
not
find
you
i
should
have
found
you
wherever
you
had
gone
but
as
it
happens
it
was
easy
enough
you
forgot
that
you
had
forwarded
flowers
to
your
friend
in
hospital
she
was
ready
enough
to
give
me
your
address
and
now
he
held
out
his
hands
gazing
down
into
her
face
what
have
you
to
say
to
me
now
instinctively
claire
hands
stretched
out
to
meet
his
but
on
the
following
impulse
she
drew
back
clasping
them
nervously
behind
her
back
oh
are
you
she
cried
breathlessly
are
you
you
are
sure
think
what
it
means
think
of
the
difference
it
might
make
i
have
no
money
no
influence
i
be
an
expense
to
you
and
a
drag
when
another
girl
might
help
think
think
oh
do
be
quite
sure
erskine
stern
eyes
melted
into
a
beautiful
tenderness
as
he
looked
at
her
troubled
face
he
waited
no
longer
but
came
a
step
nearer
and
took
forcible
possession
of
the
hidden
hands
it
is
not
my
feelings
which
are
in
question
it
is
there
has
been
no
doubt
in
my
mind
for
months
past
i
think
you
know
that
claire
but
your
career
i
can
look
after
my
own
career
do
you
think
it
is
the
straight
thing
to
suggest
to
a
soldier
that
he
needs
a
woman
to
help
him
in
his
work
it
not
as
a
soldier
i
need
you
but
as
a
man
i
need
you
there
claire
i
need
you
badly
no
one
else
could
help
me
as
you
can
claire
lips
quivered
but
still
she
hung
back
standing
away
from
him
at
the
length
of
her
stretched
arms
i
no
money
i
a
a
your
friends
will
think
i
am
not
considering
what
my
friends
will
think
your
mother
thought
i
am
not
asking
you
to
marry
my
mother
mothers
of
only
sons
are
hard
to
please
but
you
know
as
well
as
i
can
tell
you
that
the
mater
is
fond
of
you
at
heart
and
that
she
will
grow
fonder
still
she
had
her
own
ideas
and
she
fought
for
them
but
she
wo
fight
any
more
you
must
be
hard
on
the
mater
claire
she
has
done
her
best
for
me
day
i
know
i
know
i
was
sorry
for
her
sorrier
than
i
was
for
myself
it
so
hard
that
i
should
have
come
between
you
two
at
that
erskine
laughed
a
short
impatient
laugh
oh
claire
claire
how
long
are
you
going
to
waste
time
in
discussing
other
people
feelings
before
you
tell
me
about
your
own
darling
i
in
love
with
you
i
in
love
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
impatient
i
waiting
there
no
one
in
the
world
for
me
at
this
moment
but
just
yourself
i
waiting
for
you
to
forget
every
one
but
me
do
you
love
me
claire
you
know
i
do
you
know
i
do
oh
cried
claire
yielding
to
the
strength
of
the
strong
arms
and
resting
her
head
on
the
broad
shoulder
with
an
unspeakable
rush
of
joy
and
rest
oh
but
you
do
know
how
much
i
ca
tell
you
i
ca
put
it
into
words
but
it
my
whole
heart
my
whole
life
oh
every
has
been
with
you
for
such
a
long
long
time
my
darling
my
own
sweet
brave
little
girl
and
my
thoughts
with
you
thank
god
we
shall
be
together
now
we
have
had
enough
of
separation
and
chance
meetings
there
must
be
an
end
of
that
have
to
marry
me
at
once
this
was
rushing
ahead
with
a
vengeance
claire
shook
her
head
with
a
little
laugh
sweet
as
a
chime
of
joy
bells
you
ridiculous
boy
i
ca
it
impossible
you
forget
my
work
there
all
next
term
i
could
possibly
leave
without
giving
notice
could
you
we
see
to
that
do
you
seriously
believe
that
going
to
let
you
go
back
to
that
drudgery
and
kick
my
heels
waiting
for
four
months
you
do
understand
the
kind
of
man
you
are
marrying
my
lass
claire
loved
the
sound
of
that
my
lass
loved
the
close
grip
of
the
arms
the
feel
of
the
rough
cheek
against
her
own
for
a
few
minutes
neither
spoke
too
utterly
completely
absorbed
in
each
presence
to
claire
as
to
erskine
a
four
months
delay
seemed
an
aeon
of
time
through
which
to
wade
before
the
consummation
of
a
perfect
happiness
but
it
seemed
impossible
that
it
could
be
avoided
miss
farnborough
would
never
let
me
off
she
would
be
indignant
with
me
for
asking
i
tackle
miss
farnborough
leave
miss
farnborough
to
me
returned
erskine
with
so
confident
an
air
that
claire
shook
with
amusement
seeing
before
her
a
picture
of
her
lover
seated
with
the
formidable
head
breaking
to
her
the
news
that
one
of
her
staff
intended
to
play
truant
it
very
easy
to
say
that
you
do
know
her
she
thinks
everything
in
the
world
comes
second
to
education
what
if
she
does
i
agree
with
her
you
the
most
precious
darling
in
all
the
world
but
you
ca
honestly
believe
that
there
are
a
thousand
other
mistresses
who
could
teach
those
flappers
as
well
or
better
whereas
for
well
it
claire
or
no
one
throw
myself
on
the
good
lady
tender
mercies
and
ask
for
your
release
as
a
favour
to
myself
and
i
bet
you
anything
you
like
that
i
succeed
miss
farnborough
was
a
woman
before
she
was
a
set
you
free
all
right
perhaps
perhaps
possibly
at
the
half
term
rubbish
the
half
term
we
be
married
and
settled
down
before
we
get
near
then
where
will
you
go
for
our
marriage
claire
to
mrs
willoughby
i
sure
she
be
willing
no
no
claire
marvelled
at
the
obtuseness
of
men
at
the
utter
unconsciousness
of
this
particular
man
of
the
reason
why
mrs
willoughby
house
should
be
the
last
one
on
earth
from
which
his
marriage
should
take
place
and
then
in
the
midst
of
these
questionings
to
her
own
surprise
a
sudden
pricking
of
tears
came
to
her
eyes
and
she
cried
sharply
i
want
mother
i
must
have
mother
she
must
come
home
she
come
at
once
when
she
hears
we
cable
that
will
be
best
of
all
i
longing
to
meet
your
mother
and
you
ought
to
have
her
with
you
little
lass
poor
little
lonely
lass
please
god
you
shall
never
be
lonely
any
more
ah
erskine
darling
but
the
claire
cried
and
there
was
the
sharpness
of
pain
in
her
voice
from
within
the
shelter
of
her
lover
arms
her
heart
went
out
in
a
wave
of
tenderness
towards
her
sisters
who
stood
apart
from
the
royal
feast
towards
cecil
with
her
blighted
love
sophie
with
her
blighted
health
with
the
thousand
others
for
whom
they
stood
as
types
the
countless
hordes
of
women
workers
for
whom
life
was
a
monotonous
round
of
hued
days
shadowed
by
the
prospect
of
age
and
want
from
the
shelter
of
her
lover
arms
claire
gifford
vowed
herself
to
the
service
of
her
working
sisters
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
thanked
god
for
the
year
of
work
which
had
taught
her
to
the
end
