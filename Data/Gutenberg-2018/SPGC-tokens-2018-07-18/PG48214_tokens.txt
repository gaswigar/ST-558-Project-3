mastered

wrested

it

hailed
thee
friend
with

and
with
fear
when
thy

fell
on
me
sweetly
all
i

seen
appeared
strange
friendless
were
my

i
never
seemed
to

who
came
nigh
thee
however
straightway
i
knew
and
i

thou
wert
mine
when
i

thee
what
i
hid
in

all
i
am
clear
as
the
day
dawned
to
my

like
tones
to
the
ear
echoing
back
when
upon
my
frosty
desert
my
eyes
first
beheld
a
friend
hangs
enraptured
on
his
neck
and
looks
him
close
in
the
siegmund
o
rapture
most
blissful
woman
most
blest
sieglinde
to
his
o
let
me
closer
and
closer
clinging
discern
more
clearly
the
sacred
light
that
from
thine
eyes
and
face
shines
forth
and
so
sweetly
sways
every
sense
siegmund
the
light
falls
on
thy

of
something

man
i
first
saw
already
i
have
seen
siegmund
a
dream
of
love
i
too
recall
i
saw
thee
there
and
yearned
for
thee
sore

as
a

no
i
heard
the
sound
lately
when
calling
in

rang
siegmund
to
sweet

melodious
music
i
listen
sieglinde
into
his

alas
how
to
find

thee
if

not
treason
to

thou
wouldst
be
unworthy

brünnhilde
i
am
not

i
knew
well
this
one
thing
that
thy
love
was
the
wälsung
i
knew
that
by
discord
drawn
two
ways
this
one
thing
thou
hadst
forgotten
the
other
only
couldst
thou
discern
what
so
bitterly
wounded
thy
heart
that
siegmund
might
not
be
shielded

and
yet
thou
didst
dare
to
shield
him
knowing
was
so
brünnhilde

i
the
one
thing
had
kept
in
my
eye
while
by
twofold
desire
divided
wert
thou
blindly
thy
back
on
him

who
wards
thy

she
saw
alone
what
thou
sawest
not
siegmund
i
beheld
bringing
him
doom
i
approached
i
looked
in
his
eyes
gave
ear
to
his
words
i
perceived
the
bitter
distress
loud
the
lament
of
the
brave
one
resounded
uttermost
most
terrible
pang
saddest
of
hearts
defying
all
odds
with
my
ear
i
heard
my
eye
beheld
that
which
stirred
the
heart
in
my
breast
with
trouble
holy
and
strange
shamed
astonished
shrinking
i
stood
then
all
my
thought
was
how
i
could
serve
him
triumph
and
death
to
share
with
siegmund
that
seemed
that
only
the
lot
i
could
choose
faithful
to
him
who
taught
my

this
love
and
set
me
by
the
wälsung
side
as
friend
most
faithful
to
him
thy
word
i
disobeyed

thou
hast
done

withheld
from

burning

the

woke
in

the
draught

by
thy

thou

thy

with

when
sweetly
lisped
by

mouth
the

those
eyes
so
radiant

that
oft
in

on
me
shone

hopeless
yearning
my

was
wasting
