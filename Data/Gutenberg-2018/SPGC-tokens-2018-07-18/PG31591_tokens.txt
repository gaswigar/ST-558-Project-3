at

i
saw
a
crowd
a
host
of
golden
daffodils
beside
the
lake
beneath
the
trees
fluttering
and
dancing
in
the
breeze
continuous
as
the
stars
that
shine
and
twinkle
in
the

way
they
stretched
in

along
the

a

ten

at

tossing
their
heads
in
sprightly

the

beside
them
danced
but
they
outdid
the
sparkling
waves
in
glee
a
poet
could
not
but
be
gay
in
such
a
jocund
company
i
gazed
and
gazed
but
little
thought
what
wealth
the
show
to
me
had
brought
for
oft
when
on
my
couch
i
lie
in
vacant
or
in
pensive
mood
they
flash
upon
that
inward
eye
which
is
the
bliss
of
solitude
and
then
my

with
pleasure
fills
and
dances

the
daffodils

sensitive
a
sensitive
plant
in
a
garden
grew
and
the
young
winds
fed
it
with
silver
dew
and
it
opened
its
leaves
to
the
light
and
closed
them
beneath
the
kisses
of
night
but
none
ever
trembled
and
panted
with
bliss
in
the
garden
the
field
or
the
wilderness
like
doe
in
the
noontide
with
love
sweet
want
as
the
companionless
sensitive
plant
the
snowdrop
and
then
the
violet
arose
from
the
ground
with
warm
rain
wet
and
their
breath
was
mixed
with
fresh
odour
sent
from
the
turf
like
the
voice
and
the
instrument
then
the
pied
and
the
tulip
tall
and
narcissi
the
fairest
among
them
all
who
gaze
on
their
eyes
in
the
stream
recess
till
they
die
of
their
own
dear
loveliness
and
the
lily
of
the
vale
whom
youth
makes
so
fair
and
passion
so
pale
that
the
light
of
its
tremulous
bells
is
seen
through
their
pavilions
of
tender
green
and
the
hyacinth
purple
and
white
and
blue
which
flung
from
its
bells
a
sweet
peal
anew
of
music
so
delicate
soft
and
intense
it
was
felt
like
an
odour
within
the
sense
and
the
rose
like
a
nymph
to
the
bath
addrest
which
unveiled
the
depth
of
her
glowing
breast
till
fold
after
fold
to
the
fainting
air
the
soul
of
her
beauty
and
love
lay
bare
and
the
lily
which
lifted
up
as
a
mænad
its
cup
till
the
fiery
star
which
is
its
eye
gazed
through
the
clear
dew
on
the
tender
sky
and
the
jessamine
faint
and
the
sweet
tuberose
the
sweetest
flower
for
scent
that
blows
and
all
rare
blossoms
from
every
clime
grew
in
that
garden
in
perfect
prime
the
sensitive
plant
which
could
give
small
fruit
of
the
love
which
it
felt
from
the
leaf
to
the
root
received
more
than
all
flowers
it
loved
more
than
ever
where
none
wanted
but
it
could
belong
to
the
giver
for
the
sensitive
plant
has
no
bright
flower
radiance
and
odour
are
not
its
dower
it
loves
even
like
love
its
deep
heart
is
full
it
desires
what
it
has
not
the
beautiful
each
and
all
like
ministering
angels
were
for
the
sensitive
plant
sweet
joy
to
bear
whilst
the
lagging
hours
of
the
day
went
by
like
windless
clouds
a
tender
sky
and
when
evening
descended
from
heaven
above
and
the
earth
was
all
rest
and
the
air
was
all
love
and
delight
though
less
bright
was
far
more
deep
and
the
day
veil
fell
from
the
world
of
sleep
the
sensitive
plant
was
the
earliest
into
the
bosom
of
rest

we

short

dry
away

you
this
primrose
all
bepearled
with
dew
i
straight
will
whisper
in
your
ears
the
sweets
of
love
are
washed
with

ask
me
why
this

doth
show
so
yellow
green
and
sickly
too
ask
me
why
the
stalk
is
weak
and
bending
yet
it
doth
not
break
i
must
tell
you
these
discover
what
doubts
and
fears
are
in
a
lover
carew
sleeping
in
midst
of
all
there
lay
a
sleeping
youth
of
fondest
beauty
sideway
his
face
reposed
on
one
white
arm
and
tenderly
unclosed
by
tenderest
pressure
a
faint
damask
mouth
to
slumbery
pout
just
as
the
morning
south
disparts
a
rose
above
his
head
four
lily
stalks
did
their
white
honours
wed
to
make
a
coronal
and
round
him
grew
all
tendrils
green
of
every
bloom
and
hue
together
intertwined
and
trammel
fresh
the
vine
of
glossy
sprout
the
ivy
mesh
shading
its
ethiop
berries
and
woodbine
of
velvet
leaves
and
bugle
blooms

hard
by
stood
serene
cupids
watching
silently
one
kneeling
to
a
lyre
touch
the
strings
muffling
to
death
the
pathos
with
his
wings
and
ever
and
anon
uprose
to
look
at
the
youth
slumber
while
another
took
a
willow
bough
distilling
odorous
dew
and
shook
it
on
his
hair
another
flew
in
through
the
woven
roof
and
rain
violets
upon
his
sleeping
eyes
keats
modonna
wherefore
hast
thou
sent
to
me
sweet
basil
and
mignonette
embleming
love
and
health
which
never
yet
in
the
same
wreath
might
be
alas
and
they
are
wet
is
it
with
thy
kisses
or
thy
tears
for
never
rain
or
dew
such
fragrance
drew
from
plant
or
flower
the
very
doubt
endears
my
sadness
ever
new
the
sighs
i
breathe
the
tears
i
shed
for
thee
shelley
there
grew
pied
and
violets
daisies
those
pearl
arcturi
of
the
earth
the
constellated
flowers
that
never
set
faint
oxlips
tender
at
whose
birth
the
sod
scarce
heaved
and
that
tall
flower
that
wets
its
mother
face
with
tears
when
the
low
wind
its
playmate
voice
it
hears
and
in
the
warm
hedge
grew
lush
eglantine
green
and
the
may
and
cherry
blossoms
and
white
cups
whose
wine
was
the
bright
dew
yet
drained
not
by
the
day
and
wild
roses
and

serpentine
with
its
dark
buds
and
leaves
wandering
astray

streaked
with
gold
fairer
than

nearer

broad
purple
prankt
with
white

which
