this
book
is
affectionately
dedicated
by
the
author
preface
to
fifteenth
edition
i
have
been
led
by
the
publication
of
a
french
translation
of
this
little
volume
to
read
it
through
very
carefully
for
the
first
time
since
its
first
appearance
the
has
convinced
me
that
it
ought
not
to
go
to
another
impression
without
a
word
or
two
by
way
of
preface
with
regard
to
the
changes
which
our
singular
system
of
congressional
government
has
undergone
since
these
pages
were
written
i
must
ask
those
who
read
them
now
to
remember
that
they
were
written
during
the
years
and
and
that
inasmuch
as
they
describe
a
living
system
like
all
other
living
things
subject
to
constant
subtle
modifications
alike
of
form
and
of
function
their
description
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
not
as
accurate
now
as
i
believe
it
to
have
been
at
the
time
i
wrote
it
this
is
as
might
have
been
expected
more
noticeable
in
matters
of
detail
than
in
matters
of
substance
there
are
now
for
example
not
three
hundred
and
but
three
hundred
and
members
in
the
house
of
representatives
and
that
number
will
no
doubt
be
still
further
increased
by
the
reapportionment
which
will
follow
the
census
of
the
present
year
the
number
of
committees
in
both
senate
and
house
is
constantly
on
the
increase
it
is
now
usually
quite
sixty
in
the
house
and
in
the
senate
more
than
forty
there
has
been
a
still
further
addition
to
the
number
of
the
spending
committees
in
the
house
of
representatives
by
the
subdivision
of
the
powerful
committee
on
appropriations
though
the
number
of
committees
in
nominal
control
of
the
finances
of
the
country
is
still
as
large
as
ever
the
tendency
is
now
towards
a
concentration
of
all
that
is
vital
in
the
business
into
the
hands
of
a
few
of
the
more
prominent
which
are
most
often
mentioned
in
the
text
the
auditing
committees
on
the
several
departments
for
example
have
now
for
some
time
exercised
little
more
than
a
merely
nominal
oversight
over
executive
expenditures
since
the
text
was
written
the
tenure
of
office
act
which
sought
to
restrict
the
president
removal
from
office
has
been
repealed
and
even
before
its
repeal
it
was
in
fact
inoperative
after
the
time
of
president
johnson
against
whom
it
was
aimed
the
party
in
power
in
congress
found
little
occasion
to
insist
upon
its
enforcement
its
constitutionality
was
doubtful
and
it
fell
into
the
background
i
did
not
make
sufficient
allowance
for
these
facts
in
writing
the
one
or
two
sentences
of
the
book
which
refer
to
the
act
neither
did
i
give
sufficient
weight
i
now
believe
to
the
powers
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
however
minutely
bound
guided
restricted
by
statute
his
power
has
proved
at
many
a
critical
juncture
in
our
financial
history
notably
in
our
recent
financial
history
of
the
utmost
consequence
several
times
since
this
book
was
written
the
country
has
been
witness
to
his
decisive
influence
upon
the
money
markets
in
the
use
of
his
authority
with
regard
to
the
bond
issues
of
the
government
and
his
right
to
control
the
disposition
of
the
funds
of
the
treasury
in
these
matters
however
he
has
exercised
not
political
but
business
power
he
has
helped
the
markets
as
a
banker
would
help
them
he
has
altered
no
policy
he
has
merely
made
arrangements
which
would
release
money
for
use
and
facilitate
loan
and
investment
the
country
feels
safer
when
an
experienced
banker
like
gage
is
at
the
head
of
the
treasury
than
when
an
experienced
politician
is
in
charge
of
it
all
these
however
are
matters
of
detail
there
are
matters
of
substance
to
speak
of
also
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
i
could
say
quite
so
confidently
now
as
i
said
in
that
the
senate
of
the
united
states
faithfully
represents
the
several
elements
of
the
nation
makeup
and
furnishes
us
with
a
prudent
and
normally
constituted
moderating
and
revising
chamber
certainly
vested
interests
have
now
got
a
much
more
formidable
hold
upon
the
senate
than
they
seemed
to
have
sixteen
years
ago
its
political
character
also
has
undergone
a
noticeable
change
the
tendency
seems
to
be
to
make
of
the
senate
instead
of
merely
a
smaller
and
more
deliberate
house
of
representatives
a
body
of
successful
party
managers
still
these
features
of
its
life
may
be
temporary
and
may
easily
be
exaggerated
we
do
not
yet
know
either
whether
they
will
persist
or
should
they
persist
whither
they
will
lead
us
a
more
important
matter
at
any
rate
a
thing
more
concrete
and
visible
is
the
gradual
integration
of
the
organization
of
the
house
of
representatives
the
power
of
the
speaker
has
of
late
years
taken
on
new
phases
he
is
now
more
than
ever
expected
to
guide
and
control
the
whole
course
of
business
in
the
house
if
not
alone
at
any
rate
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
small
committee
on
rules
of
which
he
is
chairman
that
committee
is
expected
not
only
to
reformulate
and
revise
from
time
to
time
the
permanent
rules
of
the
house
but
also
to
look
closely
to
the
course
of
its
business
from
day
to
day
make
its
programme
and
virtually
control
its
use
of
its
time
the
committee
consists
of
five
members
but
the
speaker
and
the
two
other
members
of
the
committee
who
represent
the
majority
in
the
house
determine
its
action
and
its
action
is
allowed
to
govern
the
house
it
in
effect
regulates
the
precedence
of
measures
whenever
occasion
requires
it
determines
what
shall
and
what
shall
not
be
undertaken
it
is
like
a
steering
ministry
without
a
ministry
public
responsibility
and
without
a
ministry
right
to
speak
for
both
houses
it
is
a
private
piece
of
party
machinery
within
the
single
chamber
for
which
it
acts
the
speaker
himself
not
as
a
member
of
the
committee
on
rules
but
by
the
exercise
of
his
right
to
recognize
on
the
floor
undertakes
to
determine
very
absolutely
what
bills
individual
members
shall
be
allowed
to
bring
to
a
vote
out
of
the
regular
order
fixed
by
the
rules
or
arranged
by
the
committee
on
rules
this
obviously
creates
in
germ
at
least
a
recognized
and
sufficiently
concentrated
leadership
within
the
house
the
country
is
beginning
to
know
that
the
speaker
and
the
committee
on
rules
must
be
held
responsible
in
all
ordinary
seasons
for
the
success
or
failure
of
the
session
so
far
as
the
house
is
concerned
the
congressional
caucus
has
fallen
a
little
into
the
background
it
is
not
often
necessary
to
call
it
together
except
when
the
majority
is
impatient
or
recalcitrant
under
the
guidance
of
the
committee
on
rules
to
this
new
leadership
however
as
to
everything
else
connected
with
committee
government
the
taint
of
privacy
attaches
it
is
not
leadership
upon
the
open
floor
avowed
defended
in
public
debate
set
before
the
view
and
criticism
of
the
country
it
integrates
the
house
alone
not
the
senate
does
not
unite
the
two
houses
in
policy
affects
only
the
chamber
in
which
there
is
the
least
opportunity
for
debate
the
least
chance
that
responsibility
may
be
properly
and
effectively
lodged
and
avowed
it
has
only
a
very
remote
and
partial
resemblance
to
genuine
party
leadership
much
the
most
important
change
to
be
noticed
is
the
result
of
the
war
with
spain
upon
the
lodgment
and
exercise
of
power
within
our
federal
system
the
greatly
increased
power
and
opportunity
for
constructive
statesmanship
given
the
president
by
the
plunge
into
international
politics
and
into
the
administration
of
distant
dependencies
which
has
been
that
war
most
striking
and
momentous
consequence
when
foreign
affairs
play
a
prominent
part
in
the
politics
and
policy
of
a
nation
its
executive
must
of
necessity
be
its
guide
must
utter
every
initial
judgment
take
every
first
step
of
action
supply
the
information
upon
which
it
is
to
act
suggest
and
in
large
measure
control
its
conduct
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
now
as
of
course
at
the
front
of
affairs
as
no
president
except
lincoln
has
been
since
the
first
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
when
the
foreign
relations
of
the
new
nation
had
first
to
be
adjusted
there
is
no
trouble
now
about
getting
the
president
speeches
printed
and
read
every
word
upon
his
choice
his
character
his
experience
hang
some
of
the
most
weighty
issues
of
the
future
the
government
of
dependencies
must
be
largely
in
his
hands
interesting
things
may
come
out
of
the
singular
change
for
one
thing
new
prizes
in
public
service
may
attract
a
new
order
of
talent
the
nation
may
get
a
better
civil
service
because
of
the
sheer
necessity
we
shall
be
under
of
organizing
a
service
capable
of
carrying
the
novel
burdens
we
have
shouldered
it
may
be
too
that
the
new
leadership
of
the
executive
inasmuch
as
it
is
likely
to
last
will
have
a
very
effect
upon
our
whole
method
of
government
it
may
give
the
heads
of
the
executive
departments
a
new
influence
upon
the
action
of
congress
it
may
bring
about
as
a
consequence
an
integration
which
will
substitute
statesmanship
for
government
by
mass
meeting
it
may
put
this
whole
volume
hopelessly
out
of
date
woodrow

princeton
university
preface
the
object
of
these
essays
is
not
to
exhaust
criticism
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
but
only
to
point
out
the
most
characteristic
practical
features
of
the
federal
system
taking
congress
as
the
central
and
predominant
power
of
the
system
their
object
is
to
illustrate
everything
congressional
everybody
has
seen
and
critics
without
number
have
said
that
our
form
of
national
government
is
singular
possessing
a
character
altogether
its
own
but
there
is
abundant
evidence
that
very
few
have
seen
just
wherein
it
differs
most
essentially
from
the
other
governments
of
the
world
there
have
been
and
are
other
federal
systems
quite
similar
and
scarcely
any
legislative
or
administrative
principle
of
our
constitution
was
young
even
when
that
constitution
was
framed
it
is
our
legislative
and
administrative
which
makes
our
government
essentially
different
from
all
other
great
governmental
systems
the
most
striking
contrast
in
modern
politics
is
not
between
presidential
and
monarchical
governments
but
between
congressional
and
parliamentary
governments
congressional
government
is
committee
government
parliamentary
government
is
government
by
a
responsible
cabinet
ministry
these
are
the
two
principal
types
which
present
themselves
for
the
instruction
of
the
modern
student
of
the
practical
in
politics
administration
by
executive
agents
who
obey
the
dictation
of
a
legislature
to
which
they
are
not
responsible
and
administration
by
executive
agents
who
are
the
accredited
leaders
and
accountable
servants
of
a
legislature
virtually
supreme
in
all
things
my
chief
aim
in
these
essays
has
been
therefore
an
adequate
illustrative
contrast
of
these
two
types
of
government
with
a
view
to
making
as
plain
as
possible
the
actual
conditions
of
federal
administration
in
short
i
offer
not
a
commentary
but
an
outspoken
presentation
of
such
cardinal
facts
as
may
be

of
practical

introductory
the
laws
reach
but
a
very
little
way
constitute
government
how
you
please
infinitely
the
greater
part
of
it
must
depend
upon
the
exercise
of
powers
which
are
left
at
large
to
the
prudence
and
uprightness
of
ministers
of
state
even
all
the
use
and
potency
of
the
laws
depends
upon
them
without
them
your
commonwealth
is
no
better
than
a
scheme
upon
paper
and
not
a
living
active
effective
burke
the
great
fault
of
political
writers
is
their
too
close
adherence
to
the
forms
of
the
system
of
state
which
they
happen
to
be
expounding
or
examining
they
stop
short
at
the
anatomy
of
institutions
and
do
not
penetrate
to
the
secret
of
their
john
morley
it
would
seem
as
if
a
very
wayward
fortune
had
presided
over
the
history
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
inasmuch
as
that
great
federal
charter
has
been
alternately
violated
by
its
friends
and
defended
by
its
enemies
it
came
hard
by
its
establishment
in
the
first
place
prevailing
with
difficulty
over
the
strenuous
forces
of
dissent
which
were
banded
against
it
while
its
adoption
was
under
discussion
the
voices
of
criticism
were
many
and
authoritative
the
voices
of
opposition
loud
in
tone
and
ominous
in
volume
and
the
federalists
finally
triumphed
only
by
dint
of
hard
battle
against
foes
formidable
both
in
numbers
and
in
skill
but
the
victory
was
complete
astonishingly
complete
once
established
the
new
government
had
only
the
zeal
of
its
friends
to
fear
indeed
after
its
organization
very
little
more
is
heard
of
the
party
of
opposition
they
disappear
so
entirely
from
politics
that
one
is
inclined
to
think
in
looking
back
at
the
party
history
of
that
time
that
they
must
have
been
not
only
conquered
but
converted
as
well
there
was
universal
acquiescence
in
the
new
order
of
things
not
everybody
indeed
professed
himself
a
federalist
but
everybody
conformed
to
federalist
practice
there
were
jealousies
and
bickerings
of
course
in
the
new
congress
of
the
union
but
no
party
lines
and
the
differences
which
caused
the
constant
brewing
and
breaking
of
storms
in
washington
first
cabinet
were
of
personal
rather
than
of
political
import
hamilton
and
jefferson
did
not
draw
apart
because
the
one
had
been
an
ardent
and
the
other
only
a
lukewarm
friend
of
the
constitution
so
much
as
because
they
were
so
different
in
natural
bent
and
temper
that
they
would
have
been
like
to
disagree
and
come
to
drawn
points
wherever
or
however
brought
into
contact
the
one
had
inherited
warm
blood
and
a
bold
sagacity
while
in
the
other
a
negative
philosophy
ran
suitably
through
cool
veins
they
had
not
been
meant
for
there
was
less
antagonism
in
congress
however
than
in
the
cabinet
and
in
none
of
the
controversies
that
did
arise
was
there
shown
any
serious
disposition
to
quarrel
with
the
constitution
itself
the
contention
was
as
to
the
obedience
to
be
rendered
to
its
provisions
no
one
threatened
to
withhold
his
allegiance
though
there
soon
began
to
be
some
exhibition
of
a
disposition
to
confine
obedience
to
the
letter
of
the
new
commandments
and
to
discountenance
all
attempts
to
do
what
was
not
plainly
written
in
the
tables
of
the
law
it
was
recognized
as
no
longer
fashionable
to
say
aught
against
the
principles
of
the
constitution
but
all
men
could
not
be
of
one
mind
and
political
parties
began
to
take
form
in
antagonistic
schools
of
constitutional
construction
there
straightway
arose
two
rival
sects
of
political
pharisees
each
professing
a
more
perfect
conformity
and
affecting
greater
ceremonial
cleanliness
than
the
other
the
very
men
who
had
resisted
with
might
and
main
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
became
under
the
new
division
of
parties
its
champions
as
sticklers
for
a
strict
a
rigid
and
literal
construction
they
were
consistent
enough
in
this
because
it
was
quite
natural
that
their
fear
of
a
strong
central
government
should
pass
into
a
dread
of
the
still
further
expansion
of
the
power
of
that
government
by
a
too
loose
construction
of
its
charter
but
what
i
would
emphasize
here
is
not
the
motives
or
the
policy
of
the
conduct
of
parties
in
our
early
national
politics
but
the
fact
that
opposition
to
the
constitution
as
a
constitution
and
even
hostile
criticism
of
its
provisions
ceased
almost
immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
not
only
ceased
but
gave
place
to
an
undiscriminating
and
almost
blind
worship
of
its
principles
and
of
that
delicate
dual
system
of
sovereignty
and
that
complicated
scheme
of
double
administration
which
it
established
admiration
of
that
so
much
traversed
body
of
law
became
suddenly
all
the
vogue
and
criticism
was
estopped
from
the
first
even
down
to
the
time
immediately
preceding
the
war
the
general
scheme
of
the
constitution
went
unchallenged
nullification
itself
did
not
always
wear
its
true
garb
of
independent
state
sovereignty
but
often
masqueraded
as
a
constitutional
right
and
the
most
violent
policies
took
care
to
make
show
of
at
least
formal
deference
to
the
worshipful
fundamental
law
the
divine
right
of
kings
never
ran
a
more
prosperous
course
than
did
this
unquestioned
prerogative
of
the
constitution
to
receive
universal
homage
the
conviction
that
our
institutions
were
the
best
in
the
world
nay
more
the
model
to
which
all
civilized
states
must
sooner
or
later
conform
could
not
be
laughed
out
of
us
by
foreign
critics
nor
shaken
out
of
us
by
the
roughest
jars
of
the
system
now
there
is
of
course
nothing
in
all
this
that
is
inexplicable
or
even
remarkable
any
one
can
see
the
reasons
for
it
and
the
benefits
of
it
without
going
far
out
of
his
way
but
the
point
which
it
is
interesting
to
note
is
that
we
of
the
present
generation
are
in
the
first
season
of
free
outspoken
unrestrained
constitutional
criticism
we
are
the
first
americans
to
hear
our
own
countrymen
ask
whether
the
constitution
is
still
adapted
to
serve
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
intended
the
first
to
entertain
any
serious
doubts
about
the
superiority
of
our
own
institutions
as
compared
with
the
systems
of
europe
the
first
to
think
of
remodeling
the
administrative
machinery
of
the
federal
government
and
of
forcing
new
forms
of
responsibility
upon
congress
the
evident
explanation
of
this
change
of
attitude
towards
the
constitution
is
that
we
have
been
made
conscious
by
the
rude
shock
of
the
war
and
by
subsequent
developments
of
policy
that
there
has
been
a
vast
alteration
in
the
conditions
of
government
that
the
checks
and
balances
which
once
obtained
are
no
longer
effective
and
that
we
are
really
living
under
a
constitution
essentially
different
from
that
which
we
have
been
so
long
worshiping
as
our
own
peculiar
and
incomparable
possession
in
short
this
model
government
is
no
longer
conformable
with
its
own
original
pattern
while
we
have
been
shielding
it
from
criticism
it
has
slipped
away
from
us
the
noble
charter
of
fundamental
law
given
us
by
the
convention
of
is
still
our
constitution
but
it
is
now
our
of
rather
in
name
than
in
reality
the
form
of
the
constitution
being
one
of
nicely
adjusted
ideal
balances
whilst
the
actual
form
of
our
present
government
is
simply
a
scheme
of
congressional
supremacy
national
legislation
of
course
takes
force
now
as
at
first
from
the
authority
of
the
constitution
but
it
would
be
easy
to
reckon
by
the
score
acts
of
congress
which
can
by
no
means
be
squared
with
that
great
instrument
evident
theory
we
continue
to
think
indeed
according
to
constitutional
formulae
and
it
is
still
politically
unorthodox
to
depart
from
phraseology
in
grave
discussions
of
affairs
but
it
is
plain
to
those
who
look
about
them
that
most
of
the
commonly
received
opinions
concerning
federal
constitutional
balances
and
administrative
arrangements
are
many
years
behind
the
actual
practices
of
the
government
at
washington
and
that
we
are
farther
than
most
of
us
realize
from
the
times
and
the
policy
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
it
is
a
commonplace
observation
of
historians
that
in
the
development
of
constitutions
names
are
much
more
persistent
than
the
functions
upon
which
they
were
originally
bestowed
that
institutions
constantly
undergo
essential
alterations
of
character
whilst
retaining
the
names
conferred
upon
them
in
their
first
estate
and
the
history
of
our
own
constitution
is
but
another
illustration
of
this
universal
principle
of
institutional
change
there
has
been
a
constant
growth
of
legislative
and
administrative
practice
and
a
steady
accretion
of
precedent
in
the
management
of
federal
affairs
which
have
broadened
the
sphere
and
altered
the
functions
of
the
government
without
perceptibly
affecting
the
vocabulary
of
our
constitutional
language
ours
is
scarcely
less
than
the
british
a
living
and
fecund
system
it
does
not
indeed
find
its
rootage
so
widely
in
the
hidden
soil
of
unwritten
law
its
at
least
is
the
constitution
but
the
constitution
is
now
like
magna
carta
and
the
bill
of
rights
only
the
of
a
system
of
government
vastly
larger
than
the
stock
from
which
it
has
branched
a
system
some
of
whose
forms
have
only
very
indistinct
and
rudimental
beginnings
in
the
simple
substance
of
the
constitution
and
which
exercises
many
functions
apparently
quite
foreign
to
the
primitive
properties
contained
in
the
fundamental
law
the
constitution
itself
is
not
a
complete
system
it
takes
none
but
the
first
steps
in
organization
it
does
little
more
than
lay
a
foundation
of
principles
it
provides
with
all
possible
brevity
for
the
establishment
of
a
government
having
in
several
distinct
branches
executive
legislative
and
judicial
powers
it
vests
executive
power
in
a
single
chief
magistrate
for
whose
election
and
inauguration
it
makes
carefully
definite
provision
and
whose
privileges
and
prerogatives
it
defines
with
succinct
clearness
it
grants
specifically
enumerated
powers
of
legislation
to
a
representative
congress
outlining
the
organization
of
the
two
houses
of
that
body
and
definitely
providing
for
the
election
of
its
members
whose
number
it
regulates
and
the
conditions
of
whose
choice
it
names
and
it
establishes
a
supreme
court
with
ample
authority
of
constitutional
interpretation
prescribing
the
manner
in
which
its
judges
shall
be
appointed
and
the
conditions
of
their
official
tenure
here
the
constitution
work
of
organization
ends
and
the
fact
that
it
attempts
nothing
more
is
its
chief
strength
for
it
to
go
beyond
elementary
provisions
would
be
to
lose
elasticity
and
adaptability
the
growth
of
the
nation
and
the
consequent
development
of
the
governmental
system
would
snap
asunder
a
constitution
which
could
not
adapt
itself
to
the
new
conditions
of
an
advancing
society
if
it
could
not
stretch
itself
to
the
measure
of
the
times
it
must
be
thrown
off
and
left
behind
as
a
device
and
there
can
therefore
be
no
question
that
our
constitution
has
proved
lasting
because
of
its
simplicity
it
is
a
not
a
complete
building
or
rather
to
return
to
the
old
figure
it
is
a
root
not
a
perfect
vine
the
chief
fact
therefore
of
our
national
history
is
that
from
this
vigorous
has
grown
a
vast
constitutional
system
a
system
branching
and
expanding
in
statutes
and
judicial
decisions
as
well
as
in
unwritten
precedent
and
one
of
the
most
striking
facts
as
it
seems
to
me
in
the
history
of
our
politics
is
that
that
system
has
never
received
complete
and
competent
critical
treatment
at
the
hands
of
any
even
the
most
acute
of
our
constitutional
writers
they
view
it
as
it
were
from
behind
their
thoughts
are
dominated
it
would
seem
by
those
incomparable
papers
of
the
federalist
which
though
they
were
written
to
influence
only
the
voters
of
still
with
a
strange
persistent
longevity
of
power
shape
the
constitutional
criticism
of
the
present
day
obscuring
much
of
that
development
of
constitutional
practice
which
has
since
taken
place
the
constitution
in
operation
is
manifestly
a
very
different
thing
from
the
constitution
of
the
books
an
observer
who
looks
at
the
living
reality
will
wonder
at
the
contrast
to
the
paper
description
he
will
see
in
the
life
much
which
is
not
in
the
books
and
he
will
not
find
in
the
rough
practice
many
refinements
of
the
literary
theory
it
is
therefore
the
difficult
task
of
one
who
would
now
write
at
once
practically
and
critically
of
our
national
government
to
escape
from
theories
and
attach
himself
to
facts
not
allowing
himself
to
be
confused
by
a
knowledge
of
what
that
government
was
intended
to
be
or
led
away
into
conjectures
as
to
what
it
may
one
day
become
but
striving
to
catch
its
present
phases
and
to
photograph
the
delicate
organism
in
all
its
characteristic
parts
exactly
as
it
is
an
undertaking
all
the
more
arduous
and
doubtful
of
issue
because
it
has
to
be
entered
upon
without
guidance
from
writers
of
acknowledged
authority
the
leading
inquiry
in
the
examination
of
any
system
of
government
must
of
course
concern
primarily
the
real
depositaries
and
the
essential
machinery
of
power
there
is
always
a
centre
of
power
where
in
this
system
is
that
centre
in
whose
hands
is
authority
lodged
and
through
what
agencies
does
that
authority
speak
and
act
the
answers
one
gets
to
these
and
kindred
questions
from
authoritative
manuals
of
constitutional
exposition
are
not
satisfactory
chiefly
because
they
are
contradicted
by
facts
it
is
said
that
there
is
no
single
or
central
force
in
our
federal
and
so
there
is
not
in
the
federal
scheme
but
only
a
balance
of
powers
and
a
nice
adjustment
of
interactive
checks
as
all
the
books
say
how
is
it
however
in
the
practical
conduct
of
the
federal
government
in
that
unquestionably
the
predominant
and
controlling
force
the
centre
and
source
of
all
motive
and
of
all
regulative
power
is
congress
all
niceties
of
constitutional
restriction
and
even
many
broad
principles
of
constitutional
limitation
have
been
overridden
and
a
thoroughly
organized
system
of
congressional
control
set
up
which
gives
a
very
rude
negative
to
some
theories
of
balance
and
some
schemes
for
distributed
powers
but
which
suits
well
with
convenience
and
does
violence
to
none
of
the
principles
of
contained
in
the
constitution
this
fact
however
though
evident
enough
is
not
on
the
surface
it
does
not
obtrude
itself
upon
the
observation
of
the
world
it
runs
through
the
undercurrents
of
government
and
takes
shape
only
in
the
inner
channels
of
legislation
and
administration
which
are
not
open
to
the
common
view
it
can
be
discerned
most
readily
by
comparing
the
literary
theory
of
the
constitution
with
the
actual
machinery
of
legislation
especially
at
those
points
where
that
machinery
regulates
the
relations
of
congress
with
the
executive
departments
and
with
the
attitude
of
the
houses
towards
the
supreme
court
on
those
occasions
happily
not
numerous
when
legislature
and
judiciary
have
come
face
to
face
in
direct
antagonism
the
literary
theory
is
distinct
enough
every
american
is
familiar
with
the
paper
pictures
of
the
constitution
most
prominent
in
such
pictures
are
the
ideal
checks
and
balances
of
the
federal
system
which
may
be
found
described
even
in
the
most
recent
books
in
terms
substantially
the
same
as
those
used
in
by
john
adams
in
his
letter
to
john
taylor
is
there
says
adams
a
constitution
upon
record
more
complicated
with
balances
than
ours
in
the
first
place
eighteen
states
and
some
territories
are
balanced
against
the
national
government
in
the
second
place
the
house
of
representatives
is
balanced
against
the
senate
the
senate
against
the
house
in
the
third
place
the
executive
authority
is
in
some
degree
balanced
against
the
legislative
in
the
fourth
place
the
judicial
power
is
balanced
against
the
house
the
senate
the
executive
power
and
the
state
governments
in
the
fifth
place
the
senate
is
balanced
against
the
president
in
all
appointments
to
office
and
in
all
treaties
in
the
sixth
place
the
people
hold
in
their
hands
the
balance
against
their
own
representatives
by
biennial
elections
in
the
seventh
place
the
legislatures
of
the
several
states
are
balanced
against
the
senate
by
sextennial
elections
in
the
eighth
place
the
electors
are
balanced
against
the
people
in
the
choice
of
the
president
here
is
a
complicated
refinement
of
balances
which
for
anything
i
recollect
is
an
invention
of
our
own
and
peculiar
to
us
all
of
these
balances
are
reckoned
essential
in
the
theory
of
the
constitution
but
none
is
so
quintessential
as
that
between
the
national
and
the
state
governments
it
is
the
pivotal
quality
of
the
system
indicating
its
principal
which
is
its
federal
characteristic
the
object
of
this
balance
of
states
and
some
territories
against
the
powers
of
the
federal
government
as
also
of
several
of
the
other
balances
enumerated
is
not
it
should
be
observed
to
prevent
the
invasion
by
the
national
authorities
of
those
provinces
of
legislation
by
plain
expression
or
implication
reserved
to
the
states
such
as
the
regulation
of
municipal
institutions
the
punishment
of
ordinary
crimes
the
enactment
of
laws
of
inheritance
and
of
contract
the
erection
and
maintenance
of
the
common
machinery
of
education
and
the
control
of
other
such
like
matters
of
social
economy
and
administration
but
to
check
and
trim
national
policy
on
national
questions
to
turn
congress
back
from
paths
of
dangerous
encroachment
on
middle
or
doubtful
grounds
of
jurisdiction
to
keep
sharp
when
it
was
like
to
become
dim
the
line
of
demarcation
between
state
and
federal
privilege
to
readjust
the
weights
of
jurisdiction
whenever
either
state
or
federal
scale
threatened
to
kick
the
beam
there
never
was
any
great
likelihood
that
the
national
government
would
care
to
take
from
the
states
their
plainer
prerogatives
but
there
was
always
a
violent
probability
that
it
would
here
and
there
steal
a
march
over
the
borders
where
territory
like
its
own
invited
it
to
appropriation
and
it
was
for
a
mutual
defense
of
such
that
the
two
governments
were
given
the
right
to
call
a
halt
upon
one
another
it
was
purposed
to
guard
not
against
revolution
but
against
unrestrained
exercise
of
questionable
powers
the
extent
to
which
the
restraining
power
of
the
states
was
relied
upon
in
the
days
of
the
convention
and
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
is
strikingly
illustrated
in
several
of
the
best
known
papers
of
the
federalist
and
there
is
no
better
means
of
realizing
the
difference
between
the
actual
and
the
ideal
constitutions
than
this
of
placing
one
self
at
the
point
of
view
of
the
public
men
of
they
were
disgusted
with
the
impotent
and
pitiable
confederation
which
could
do
nothing
but
beg
and
deliberate
they
longed
to
get
away
from
the
selfish
feuds
of
states
dissevered
discordant
belligerent
and
their
hopes
were
centred
in
the
establishment
of
a
strong
and
lasting
union
such
as
could
secure
that
concert
and
facility
of
common
action
in
which
alone
there
could
be
security
and
amity
they
were
however
by
no
means
sure
of
being
able
to
realize
their
hopes
contrive
how
they
might
to
bring
the
states
together
into
a
more
perfect
confederation
the
late
colonies
had
but
recently
become
compactly
organized
states
and
were
standing
somewhat
stiffly
apart
a
group
of
consequential
sovereignties
jealous
to
maintain
their
prerogatives
and
quick
to
distrust
any
power
set
above
them
or
arrogating
to
itself
the
control
of
their
restive
wills
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
the
sturdy
masterful
men
who
had
won
independence
for
their
native
colonies
by
passing
through
the
flames
of
battle
and
through
the
equally
fierce
fires
of
bereavement
and
financial
ruin
would
readily
transfer
their
affection
and
allegiance
from
the
states
which
were
their
homes
to
the
federal
government
which
was
to
be
a
mere
artificial
creation
and
which
could
be
to
no
man
as
his
home
government
as
things
looked
then
it
seemed
idle
to
apprehend
a
too
great
diminution
of
state
rights
there
was
every
reason
on
the
contrary
to
fear
that
any
union
that
could
be
agreed
upon
would
lack
both
vitality
and
the
ability
to
hold
its
ground
against
the
jealous
of
the
sovereign
commonwealths
of
its
membership
hamilton
but
spoke
the
common
belief
of
all
thinking
men
of
the
time
when
he
said
it
will
always
be
far
more
easy
for
the
state
governments
to
encroach
upon
the
national
authorities
than
for
the
national
government
to
encroach
upon
the
state
authorities
and
he
seemed
to
furnish
abundant
support
for
the
opinion
when
he
added
that
the
proof
of
this
proposition
turns
upon
the
greater
degree
of
influence
which
the
state
governments
if
they
administer
their
affairs
uprightly
and
prudently
will
generally
possess
over
the
people
a
circumstance
which
at
the
same
time
teaches
us
that
there
is
an
inherent
and
intrinsic
weakness
in
all
federal
constitutions
and
that
too
much
pains
can
not
be
taken
in
their
organization
to
give
them
all
the
force
that
is
compatible
with
the
principles
of
liberty
read
in
the
light
of
the
present
day
such
views
constitute
the
most
striking
of
all
commentaries
upon
our
constitutional
history
manifestly
the
powers
reserved
to
the
states
were
expected
to
serve
as
a
very
real
and
potent
check
upon
the
federal
government
and
yet
we
can
see
plainly
enough
now
that
this
balance
of
state
against
national
authorities
has
proved
of
all
constitutional
checks
the
least
effectual
the
proof
of
the
pudding
is
the
eating
thereof
and
we
can
nowadays
detect
in
it
none
of
that
strong
flavor
of
state
sovereignty
which
its
cooks
thought
they
were
giving
it
it
smacks
rather
of
federal
omnipotence
which
they
thought
to
mix
in
only
in
very
small
and
judicious
quantities
from
the
nature
of
the
case
as
judge
cooley
says
it
was
impossible
that
the
powers
reserved
to
the
states
should
constitute
a
restraint
upon
the
increase
of
federal
power
to
the
extent
that
was
at
first
expected
the
federal
government
was
necessarily
made
the
final
judge
of
its
own
authority
and
the
executor
of
its
own
will
and
any
effectual
check
to
the
gradual
amplification
of
its
jurisdiction
must
therefore
be
found
in
the
construction
put
by
those
administering
it
upon
the
grants
of
the
constitution
and
in
their
own
sense
of
constitutional
obligation
and
as
the
true
line
of
division
between
federal
and
state
powers
has
from
the
very
beginning
been
the
subject
of
contention
and
of
honest
differences
of
opinion
it
must
often
happen
that
to
advance
and
occupy
some
disputed
ground
will
seem
to
the
party
having
the
power
to
do
so
a
mere
matter
of
constitutional
duty
during
the
early
years
of
the
new
national
government
there
was
doubtless
much
potency
in
state
will
and
had
federal
and
state
powers
then
come
face
to
face
before
congress
and
the
president
had
had
time
to
overcome
their
first
awkwardness
and
timidity
and
to
discover
the
safest
walks
of
their
authority
and
the
most
effectual
means
of
exercising
their
power
it
is
probable
that
state
prerogatives
would
have
prevailed
the
central
government
as
every
one
remembers
did
not
at
first
give
promise
of
a
very
great
career
it
had
inherited
some
of
the
contempt
which
had
attached
to
the
weak
congress
of
the
confederation
two
of
the
thirteen
states
held
aloof
from
the
union
until
they
could
be
assured
of
its
stability
and
success
many
of
the
other
states
had
come
into
it
reluctantly
all
with
a
keen
sense
of
sacrifice
and
there
could
not
be
said
to
be
any
very
or
undoubting
belief
in
its
ultimate
survival
the
members
of
the
first
congress
too
came
together
very
tardily
and
in
no
very
cordial
or
confident
spirit
of
coöperation
and
after
they
had
assembled
they
were
for
many
months
painfully
embarrassed
how
and
upon
what
subjects
to
exercise
their
new
and
untried
functions
the
president
was
denied
formal
precedence
in
dignity
by
the
governor
of
new
york
and
must
himself
have
felt
inclined
to
question
the
consequence
of
his
official
station
when
he
found
that
amongst
the
principal
questions
with
which
he
had
to
deal
were
some
which
concerned
no
greater
things
than
petty
points
of
etiquette
and
ceremonial
as
for
example
whether
one
day
in
the
week
would
be
sufficient
to
receive
visits
of
compliment
and
what
would
be
said
if
he
were
sometimes
to
be
seen
at
quiet
but
this
first
weakness
of
the
new
government
was
only
a
transient
phase
in
its
history
and
the
federal
authorities
did
not
invite
a
direct
issue
with
the
states
until
they
had
had
time
to
reckon
their
resources
and
to
learn
facility
of
action
before
washington
left
the
presidential
chair
the
federal
government
had
been
thoroughly
organized
and
it
fast
gathered
strength
and
confidence
as
it
addressed
itself
year
after
year
to
the
adjustment
of
foreign
relations
to
the
defense
of
the
western
frontiers
and
to
the
maintenance
of
domestic
peace
for
years
it
had
no
chance
to
think
of
those
questions
of
internal
policy
which
in
later
days
were
to
tempt
it
to
stretch
its
constitutional
jurisdiction
the
establishment
of
the
public
credit
the
revival
of
commerce
and
the
encouragement
of
industry
the
conduct
first
of
a
heated
controversy
and
finally
of
an
unequal
war
with
england
the
avoidance
first
of
too
much
love
and
afterwards
of
too
violent
hatred
of
france
these
and
other
like
questions
of
great
pith
and
moment
gave
it
too
much
to
do
to
leave
it
time
to
think
of
nice
points
of
constitutional
theory
affecting
its
relations
with
the
states
but
still
even
in
those
busy
times
of
international
controversy
when
the
lurid
light
of
the
french
revolution
outshone
all
others
and
when
men
minds
were
full
of
those
ghosts
of
which
took
the
shape
of
british
aggressions
and
could
not
be
laid
by
any
charm
known
to
diplomacy
even
in
those
times
busy
about
other
things
there
had
been
premonitions
of
the
unequal
contest
between
state
and
federal
authorities
the
purchase
of
louisiana
had
given
new
form
and
startling
significance
to
the
assertion
of
national
sovereignty
the
alien
and
sedition
laws
had
provoked
the
and
emphatic
protests
of
kentucky
and
virginia
and
the
embargo
had
exasperated
new
england
to
threats
of
secession
nor
were
these
open
assumptions
of
questionable
prerogatives
on
the
part
of
the
national
government
the
most
significant
or
unequivocal
indications
of
an
assured
increase
of
federal
power
hamilton
as
secretary
of
the
treasury
had
taken
care
at
the
very
beginning
to
set
the
national
policy
in
ways
which
would
unavoidably
lead
to
an
almost
indefinite
expansion
of
the
sphere
of
federal
legislation
sensible
of
its
need
of
guidance
in
those
matters
of
financial
administration
which
evidently
demanded
its
immediate
attention
the
first
congress
of
the
union
promptly
put
itself
under
the
direction
of
hamilton
it
is
not
a
little
amusing
says
lodge
to
note
how
eagerly
congress
which
had
been
ably
and
honestly
struggling
with
the
revenue
with
commerce
and
with
a
thousand
details
fettered
in
all
things
by
the
awkwardness
inherent
in
a
legislative
body
turned
for
relief
to
the
new
secretary
his
advice
was
asked
and
taken
in
almost
everything
and
his
skill
as
a
party
leader
made
easy
many
of
the
more
difficult
paths
of
the
new
government
but
no
sooner
had
the
powers
of
that
government
begun
to
be
exercised
under
his
guidance
than
they
began
to
grow
in
his
famous
report
on
manufactures
were
laid
the
foundations
of
that
system
of
protective
duties
which
was
destined
to
hang
all
the
industries
of
the
country
upon
the
skirts
of
the
federal
power
and
to
make
every
trade
and
craft
in
the
land
sensitive
to
every
wind
of
party
that
might
blow
at
washington
and
in
his
equally
celebrated
report
in
favor
of
the
establishment
of
a
national
bank
there
was
called
into
requisition
for
the
first
time
that
puissant
doctrine
of
the
implied
powers
of
the
constitution
which
has
ever
since
been
the
chief
dynamic
principle
in
our
constitutional
history
this
great
doctrine
embodying
the
principle
of
liberal
construction
was
in
the
language
of
lodge
the
most
formidable
weapon
in
the
armory
of
the
constitution
and
when
hamilton
grasped
it
he
knew
and
his
opponents
felt
that
here
was
something
capable
of
conferring
on
the
federal
government
powers
of
almost
any
extent
it
served
first
as
a
sanction
for
the
charter
of
the
united
states
bank
an
institution
which
was
the
central
pillar
of
hamilton
wonderful
financial
administration
and
around
which
afterwards
as
then
played
so
many
of
the
lightnings
of
party
strife
but
the
bank
of
the
united
states
though
great
was
not
the
greatest
of
the
creations
of
that
lusty
and
seductive
doctrine
given
out
at
length
with
the
sanction
of
the
federal
supreme
court
and
containing
as
it
did
in
its
manifest
character
as
a
doctrine
of
legislative
prerogative
a
very
vigorous
principle
of
constitutional
growth
it
quickly
constituted
congress
the
dominant
nay
the
irresistible
power
of
the
federal
system
relegating
some
of
the
chief
balances
of
the
constitution
to
an
insignificant
rôle
in
the
literary
theory
of
our
institutions
its
effect
upon
the
status
of
the
states
in
the
federal
system
was
in
the
first
place
it
clearly
put
the
constitutions
of
the
states
at
a
great
disadvantage
inasmuch
as
there
was
in
them
no
like
principle
of
growth
their
stationary
sovereignty
could
by
no
means
keep
pace
with
the
nimble
progress
of
federal
influence
in
the
new
spheres
thus
opened
up
to
it
the
doctrine
of
implied
powers
was
evidently
both
facile
and
irresistible
it
concerned
the
political
discretion
of
the
national
legislative
power
and
could
therefore
elude
all
obstacles
of
judicial
interference
for
the
supreme
court
very
early
declared
itself
without
authority
to
question
the
privilege
of
determining
the
nature
and
extent
of
its
own
powers
in
the
choice
of
means
for
giving
effect
to
its
constitutional
prerogatives
and
it
has
long
stood
as
an
accepted
canon
of
judicial
action
that
judges
should
be
very
slow
to
oppose
their
opinions
to
the
legislative
will
in
cases
in
which
it
is
not
made
demonstrably
clear
that
there
has
been
a
plain
violation
of
some
unquestionable
constitutional
principle
or
some
explicit
constitutional
provision
of
encroachments
upon
state
as
well
as
of
encroachments
upon
federal
powers
the
federal
authorities
are
however
in
most
cases
the
only
and
in
all
cases
the
final
judges
the
states
are
absolutely
debarred
even
from
any
effective
defense
of
their
plain
prerogatives
because
not
they
but
the
national
authorities
are
commissioned
to
determine
with
decisive
and
unchallenged
authoritativeness
what
state
powers
shall
be
recognized
in
each
case
of
contest
or
of
conflict
in
short
one
of
the
privileges
which
the
states
have
resigned
into
the
hands
of
the
federal
government
is
the
privilege
of
determining
what
they
themselves
can
do
federal
courts
can
annul
state
action
but
state
courts
can
not
arrest
the
growth
of
congressional
power
but
this
is
only
the
doctrinal
side
of
the
case
simply
its
statement
with
an
if
and
a
but
its
practical
issue
illustrates
still
more
forcibly
the
altered
and
declining
status
of
the
states
in
the
constitutional
system
one
very
practical
issue
has
been
to
bring
the
power
of
the
federal
government
home
to
every
man
door
as
no
less
than
his
own
state
government
his
immediate
of
course
every
new
province
into
which
congress
has
been
allured
by
the
principle
of
implied
powers
has
required
for
its
administration
a
greater
or
less
enlargement
of
the
national
civil
service
which
now
through
its
hundred
thousand
officers
carries
into
every
community
of
the
land
a
sense
of
federal
power
as
the
power
of
powers
and
fixes
the
federal
authority
as
it
were
in
the
very
habits
of
society
that
is
not
a
foreign
but
a
familiar
and
domestic
government
whose
officer
is
your
neighbor
whose
representatives
you
deal
with
every
day
at
the
and
the
whose
courts
sit
in
your
own
state
and
send
their
own
marshals
into
your
own
county
to
arrest
your
own
or
to
call
you
yourself
by
writ
to
their
and
who
can
help
respecting
officials
whom
he
knows
to
be
backed
by
the
authority
and
even
by
the
power
of
the
whole
nation
in
the
performance
of
the
duties
in
which
he
sees
them
every
day
engaged
who
does
not
feel
that
the
marshal
represents
a
greater
power
than
the
sheriff
does
and
that
it
is
more
dangerous
to
molest
a
than
to
knock
down
a
policeman
this
personal
contact
of
every
citizen
with
the
federal
government
a
contact
which
makes
him
feel
himself
a
citizen
of
a
greater
state
than
that
which
controls
his
contracts
and
probates
his
father
will
more
than
offsets
his
sense
of
dependent
loyalty
to
local
authorities
by
creating
a
sensible
bond
of
allegiance
to
what
presents
itself
unmistakably
as
the
greater
and
more
sovereign
power
in
most
things
this
bond
of
allegiance
does
not
bind
him
oppressively
nor
chafe
him
distressingly
but
in
some
things
it
is
drawn
rather
painfully
tight
whilst
federal
postmasters
are
valued
and
federal
judges
unhesitatingly
obeyed
and
whilst
very
few
people
realize
the
weight
of
and
as
few
perhaps
begrudge
license
taxes
on
whiskey
and
tobacco
everybody
eyes
rather
uneasily
the
federal
supervisors
at
the
polls
this
is
preëminently
a
country
of
frequent
elections
and
few
states
care
to
increase
the
frequency
by
separating
elections
of
state
from
elections
of
national
functionaries
the
federal
supervisor
consequently
who
oversees
the
balloting
for
congressmen
practically
superintends
the
election
of
state
officers
also
for
state
officers
and
congressmen
are
usually
voted
for
at
one
and
the
same
time
and
place
by
ballots
bearing
in
common
an
entire
party
ticket
and
any
authoritative
scrutiny
of
these
ballots
after
they
have
been
cast
or
any
peremptory
power
of
challenging
those
who
offer
to
cast
them
must
operate
as
an
interference
with
state
no
less
than
with
federal
elections
the
authority
of
congress
to
regulate
the
manner
of
choosing
federal
representatives
pinches
when
it
is
made
thus
to
include
also
the
supervision
of
those
state
elections
which
are
by
no
implied
power
even
within
the
sphere
of
federal
prerogative
the
supervisor
represents
the
very
ugliest
side
of
federal
supremacy
he
belongs
to
the
least
liked
branch
of
the
civil
service
but
his
existence
speaks
very
clearly
as
to
the
present
balance
of
powers
and
his
rather
hateful
privileges
must
under
the
present
system
of
mixed
elections
result
in
impairing
the
of
state
officers
of
election
by
bringing
home
to
them
a
vivid
sense
of
subordination
to
the
powers
at
washington
a
very
different
and
much
larger
side
of
federal
predominance
is
to
be
seen
in
the
history
of
the
policy
of
internal
improvements
i
need
not
expound
that
policy
here
it
has
been
often
enough
mooted
and
long
enough
understood
to
need
no
explanation
its
practice
is
plain
and
its
persistence
unquestionable
but
its
bearings
upon
the
status
and
the
policies
of
the
states
are
not
always
clearly
seen
or
often
distinctly
pointed
out
its
chief
results
of
course
have
been
that
expansion
of
national
functions
which
was
necessarily
involved
in
the
application
of
national
funds
by
national
employees
to
the
clearing
of
inland
and
the
improvement
of
harbors
and
the
establishment
of
the
very
questionable
precedent
of
expending
in
favored
localities
moneys
raised
by
taxation
which
bears
with
equal
incidence
upon
the
people
of
all
sections
of
the
country
but
these
chief
results
by
no
means
constitute
the
sum
of
its
influence
hardly
less
significant
and
real
for
instance
are
its
moral
effects
in
rendering
state
administrations
less
and
efficient
less
prudent
and
thrifty
by
accustoming
them
to
accepting
subsidies
for
internal
improvements
from
the
federal
coffers
to
depending
upon
the
national
revenues
rather
than
upon
their
own
energy
and
enterprise
for
means
of
developing
those
resources
which
it
should
be
the
special
province
of
state
administration
to
make
available
and
profitable
there
can
i
suppose
be
little
doubt
that
it
is
due
to
the
moral
influences
of
this
policy
that
the
states
are
now
turning
to
the
common
government
for
aid
in
such
things
as
education
expecting
to
be
helped
they
will
not
help
themselves
certain
it
is
that
there
is
more
than
one
state
which
though
abundantly
able
to
pay
for
an
educational
system
of
the
greatest
efficiency
fails
to
do
so
and
contents
itself
with
imperfect
temporary
makeshifts
because
there
are
immense
surpluses
every
year
in
the
national
treasury
which
rumor
and
unauthorized
promises
say
may
be
distributed
amongst
the
states
in
aid
of
education
if
the
federal
government
were
more
careful
to
keep
apart
from
every
strictly
local
scheme
of
improvement
this
culpable
and
demoralizing
state
policy
could
scarcely
live
states
would
cease
to
wish
because
they
would
cease
to
hope
to
be
stipendiaries
of
the
government
of
the
union
and
would
address
themselves
with
diligence
to
their
proper
duties
with
much
benefit
both
to
themselves
and
to
the
federal
system
this
is
not
saying
that
the
policy
of
internal
improvements
was
either
avoidable
unconstitutional
or
unwise
but
only
that
it
has
been
carried
too
far
and
that
whether
carried
too
far
or
not
it
must
in
any
case
have
been
what
it
is
now
seen
to
be
a
big
weight
in
the
federal
scale
of
the
balance
still
other
powers
of
the
federal
government
which
have
so
grown
beyond
their
first
proportions
as
to
have
marred
very
seriously
the
symmetry
of
the
literary
theory
of
our
federal
system
have
strengthened
under
the
shadow
of
the
jurisdiction
of
congress
over
commerce
and
the
maintenance
of
the
postal
service
for
instance
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
declared
that
the
powers
granted
to
congress
by
the
constitution
to
regulate
commerce
and
to
establish
and
keep
pace
with
the
progress
of
the
country
and
adapt
themselves
to
new
developments
of
times
and
circumstances
they
extend
from
the
horse
with
its
rider
to
the
from
the
sailing
vessel
to
the
steamer
from
the
coach
and
the
steamer
to
the
railroad
and
from
the
railroad
to
the
telegraph
as
these
new
agencies
are
successively
brought
into
use
to
meet
the
demands
of
increasing
population
and
wealth
they
are
intended
for
the
government
of
the
business
to
which
they
relate
at
all
times
and
under
all
circumstances
as
they
were
intrusted
to
the
general
government
for
the
good
of
the
nation
it
is
not
only
the
right
but
the
duty
of
congress
to
see
to
it
that
the
intercourse
between
the
states
and
the
transmission
of
intelligence
are
not
obstructed
or
unnecessarily
encumbered
by
state
legislation
this
emphatic
decision
was
intended
to
sustain
the
right
of
a
telegraph
company
chartered
by
one
state
to
run
its
line
along
all
in
other
states
without
the
consent
of
those
states
and
even
against
their
will
but
it
is
manifest
that
many
other
corporate
companies
might
under
the
sanction
of
this
broad
opinion
claim
similar
privileges
in
despite
of
state
resistance
and
that
such
decisions
go
far
towards
making
state
powers
of
incorporation
of
little
worth
as
compared
with
federal
powers
of
control
keeping
pace
too
with
this
growth
of
federal
activity
there
has
been
from
the
first
a
steady
and
unmistakable
growth
of
nationality
of
sentiment
it
was
of
course
the
weight
of
war
which
finally
and
decisively
disarranged
the
balance
between
state
and
federal
powers
and
it
is
obvious
that
many
of
the
most
striking
manifestations
of
the
tendency
towards
centralization
have
made
themselves
seen
since
the
war
but
the
history
of
the
war
is
only
a
record
of
the
triumph
of
the
principle
of
national
sovereignty
the
war
was
inevitable
because
that
principle
grew
apace
and
the
war
ended
as
it
did
because
that
principle
had
become
predominant
accepted
at
first
simply
because
it
was
imperatively
necessary
the
union
of
form
and
of
law
had
become
a
union
of
sentiment
and
was
destined
to
be
a
union
of
institutions
that
sense
of
national
unity
and
community
of
destiny
which
hamilton
had
sought
to
foster
but
which
was
feeble
in
his
day
of
long
distances
and
tardy
when
the
nation
pulse
was
as
slow
as
the
and
the
postman
had
become
strong
enough
to
rule
the
continent
when
webster
died
the
war
between
the
states
was
the
supreme
and
final
struggle
between
those
forces
of
disintegration
which
still
remained
in
the
blood
of
the
body
politic
and
those
other
forces
of
health
of
union
and
amalgamation
which
had
been
gradually
building
up
that
body
in
vigor
and
strength
as
the
system
passed
from
youth
to
maturity
and
as
its
constitution
hardened
and
ripened
with
advancing
age
the
history
of
that
trenchant
policy
of
reconstruction
which
followed
close
upon
the
termination
of
the
war
as
at
once
its
logical
result
and
significant
commentary
contains
a
vivid
picture
of
the
altered
balances
of
the
constitutional
system
which
is
a
sort
of
exaggerated
miniature
falling
very
little
short
of
being
a
caricature
of
previous
constitutional
tendencies
and
federal
policies
the
tide
of
federal
aggression
probably
reached
its
highest
shore
in
the
legislation
which
put
it
into
the
power
of
the
federal
courts
to
punish
a
state
judge
for
refusing
in
the
exercise
of
his
official
discretion
to
impanel
negroes
in
the
juries
of
his
court
and
in
those
statutes
which
gave
the
federal
courts
jurisdiction
over
offenses
against
state
laws
by
state
officers
but
that
tide
has
often
run
very
high
and
however
fluctuating
at
times
has
long
been
irresistible
by
any
dykes
of
constitutional
state
privilege
so
that
judge
cooley
can
say
without
fear
of
contradiction
that
the
effectual
checks
upon
the
encroachments
of
federal
upon
state
power
must
be
looked
for
not
in
state
power
of
resistance
but
in
the
choice
of
representatives
senators
and
presidents
holding
just
constitutional
views
and
in
a
federal
supreme
court
with
competent
power
to
restrain
all
departments
and
all
officers
within
the
limits
of
their
just
authority
so
far
as
their
acts
may
become
the
subject
of
judicial
cognizance
indeed
it
is
quite
evident
that
if
federal
power
be
not
altogether
irresponsible
it
is
the
federal
judiciary
which
is
the
only
effectual
of
the
whole
system
the
federal
judges
hold
in
their
hands
the
fate
of
state
powers
and
theirs
is
the
only
authority
that
can
draw
effective
rein
on
the
career
of
congress
if
their
power
then
be
not
efficient
the
time
must
seem
sadly
out
of
joint
to
those
who
hold
to
the
literary
theory
of
our
constitution
by
the
word
of
the
supreme
court
must
all
legislation
stand
or
fall
so
long
as
law
is
respected
but
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
there
is
at
least
one
large
province
of
jurisdiction
upon
which
though
invited
and
possibly
privileged
to
appropriate
it
the
supreme
court
has
nevertheless
refused
to
enter
and
by
refusing
to
enter
which
it
has
given
over
all
attempt
to
guard
one
of
the
principal
easiest
and
most
obvious
roads
to
federal
supremacy
it
has
declared
itself
without
authority
to
interfere
with
the
of
either
congress
or
the
president
and
has
declined
all
effort
to
constrain
these
its
coördinate
departments
to
the
performance
of
any
even
the
most
constitutionally
imperative
act
when
indeed
the
president
exceeds
his
authority
or
usurps
that
which
belongs
to
one
of
the
other
departments
his
orders
commands
or
warrants
protect
no
one
and
his
agents
become
personally
responsible
for
their
acts
the
check
of
the
courts
therefore
consists
in
their
ability
to
keep
the
executive
within
the
sphere
of
his
authority
by
refusing
to
give
the
sanction
of
law
to
whatever
he
may
do
beyond
it
and
by
holding
the
agents
or
instruments
of
his
unlawful
action
to
strict
accountability
but
such
punishment
inflicted
not
directly
upon
the
chief
offender
but
vicariously
upon
his
agents
can
come
only
after
all
the
harm
has
been
done
the
courts
can
not
forestall
the
president
and
prevent
the
doing
of
mischief
they
have
no
power
of
initiative
they
must
wait
until
the
law
has
been
broken
and
voluntary
litigants
have
made
up
their
pleadings
must
wait
nowadays
many
months
often
many
years
until
those
pleadings
are
reached
in
the
regular
course
of
clearing
a
crowded
docket
besides
in
ordinary
times
it
is
not
from
the
executive
that
the
most
dangerous
encroachments
are
to
be
apprehended
the
legislature
is
the
aggressive
spirit
it
is
the
motive
power
of
the
government
and
unless
the
judiciary
can
check
it
the
courts
are
of
comparatively
little
worth
as
in
the
system
it
is
the
subtile
stealthy
almost
imperceptible
encroachments
of
policy
of
political
action
which
constitute
the
precedents
upon
which
additional
prerogatives
are
generally
reared
and
yet
these
are
the
very
encroachments
with
which
it
is
hardest
for
the
courts
to
deal
and
concerning
which
accordingly
the
federal
courts
have
declared
themselves
unauthorized
to
hold
any
opinions
they
have
naught
to
say
upon
questions
of
policy
congress
must
itself
judge
what
measures
may
legitimately
be
used
to
supplement
or
make
effectual
its
acknowledged
jurisdiction
what
are
the
laws
necessary
and
proper
for
carrying
into
execution
its
own
peculiar
powers
and
all
other
powers
vested
by
the
constitution
in
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
in
any
department
or
officer
thereof
the
courts
are
very
quick
and
too
to
discern
prerogatives
of
political
discretion
in
legislative
acts
and
exceedingly
slow
to
undertake
to
discriminate
between
what
is
and
what
is
not
a
violation
of
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
congress
must
wantonly
go
very
far
outside
of
the
plain
and
unquestionable
meaning
of
the
constitution
must
bump
its
head
directly
against
all
right
and
precedent
must
kick
against
the
very
pricks
of
all
rulings
and
interpretations
before
the
supreme
court
will
offer
it
any
distinct
rebuke
then
too
the
supreme
court
itself
however
upright
and
irreproachable
its
members
has
generally
had
and
will
undoubtedly
continue
to
have
a
distinct
political
complexion
taken
from
the
color
of
the
times
during
which
its
majority
was
chosen
the
bench
over
which
john
marshall
presided
was
as
everybody
knows
staunchly
and
avowedly
federalist
in
its
views
but
during
the
ten
years
which
followed
federalist
justices
were
rapidly
displaced
by
democrats
and
the
views
of
the
court
changed
accordingly
indeed
it
may
truthfully
be
said
that
taking
our
political
history
by
and
large
the
constitutional
interpretations
of
the
supreme
court
have
changed
slowly
but
none
the
less
surely
with
the
altered
relations
of
power
between
the
national
parties
the
federalists
were
backed
by
a
federalist
judiciary
the
period
of
democratic
supremacy
witnessed
the
triumph
of
democratic
principles
in
the
courts
and
republican
predominance
has
driven
from
the
highest
tribunal
of
the
land
all
but
one
representative
of
democratic
doctrines
it
has
been
only
during
comparatively
short
periods
of
transition
when
public
opinion
was
passing
over
from
one
political
creed
to
another
that
the
decisions
of
the
federal
judiciary
have
been
distinctly
opposed
to
the
principles
of
the
ruling
political
party
but
besides
and
above
all
this
the
national
courts
are
for
the
most
part
in
the
power
of
congress
even
the
supreme
court
is
not
beyond
its
control
for
it
is
the
legislative
privilege
to
increase
whenever
the
legislative
will
so
pleases
the
number
of
the
judges
upon
the
supreme
bench
to
dilute
the
constitution
as
webster
once
put
it
by
creating
a
court
which
shall
construe
away
its
provisions
and
this
on
one
memorable
occasion
it
did
choose
to
do
in
december
the
supreme
court
decided
against
the
constitutionality
of
congress
pet
legal
tender
acts
and
in
the
following
march
a
vacancy
on
the
bench
opportunely
occurring
and
a
new
justiceship
having
been
created
to
meet
the
emergency
the
senate
gave
the
president
to
understand
that
no
nominee
unfavorable
to
the
debated
acts
would
be
confirmed
two
justices
of
the
predominant
party
way
of
thinking
were
appointed
the
hostile
majority
of
the
court
was
outvoted
and
the
obnoxious
decision
reversed
the
creation
of
additional
justiceships
is
not
however
the
only
means
by
which
congress
can
coerce
and
control
the
supreme
court
it
may
forestall
an
adverse
decision
by
summarily
depriving
the
court
of
jurisdiction
over
the
case
in
which
such
a
decision
was
threatened
and
that
even
while
the
case
is
pending
for
only
a
very
small
part
of
the
jurisdiction
of
even
the
supreme
court
is
derived
directly
from
the
constitution
most
of
it
is
founded
upon
the
judiciary
act
of
which
being
a
mere
act
of
congress
may
be
repealed
at
any
time
that
congress
chooses
to
repeal
it
upon
this
judiciary
act
too
depend
not
only
the
powers
but
also
the
very
existence
of
the
inferior
courts
of
the
united
states
the
circuit
and
district
courts
and
their
possible
fate
in
case
of
a
conflict
with
congress
is
significantly
foreshadowed
in
that
act
of
by
which
a
democratic
congress
swept
away
root
and
branch
the
system
of
circuit
courts
which
had
been
created
in
the
previous
year
but
which
was
hateful
to
the
democrats
because
it
had
been
officered
with
federalists
in
the
last
hours
of
john
adams
administration
this
balance
of
judiciary
against
legislature
and
executive
would
seem
therefore
to
be
another
of
those
ideal
balances
which
are
to
be
found
in
the
books
rather
than
in
the
rough
realities
of
actual
practice
for
manifestly
the
power
of
the
courts
is
safe
only
during
seasons
of
political
peace
when
parties
are
not
aroused
to
passion
or
tempted
by
the
command
of
irresistible
majorities
as
for
some
of
the
other
constitutional
balances
enumerated
in
that
passage
of
the
letter
to
john
taylor
which
i
have
taken
as
a
text
their
present
inefficacy
is
quite
too
plain
to
need
proof
the
constituencies
may
have
been
balanced
against
their
representatives
in
adams
day
for
that
was
not
a
day
of
primaries
and
of
strict
caucus
discipline
the
legislatures
of
the
states
too
may
have
been
able
to
exercise
some
appreciable
influence
upon
the
action
of
the
senate
if
those
were
days
when
policy
was
the
predominant
consideration
which
determined
elections
to
the
senate
and
the
legislative
choice
was
not
always
a
matter
of
astute
management
of
mere
personal
weight
or
party
expediency
and
the
presidential
electors
undoubtedly
did
have
at
one
time
some
freedom
of
choice
in
naming
the
chief
magistrate
but
before
the
third
presidential
election
some
of
them
were
pledged
before
adams
wrote
this
letter
the
majority
of
them
were
wont
to
obey
the
dictates
of
a
congressional
caucus
and
for
the
last
fifty
years
they
have
simply
registered
the
will
of
party
conventions
it
is
noteworthy
that
adams
possibly
because
he
had
himself
been
president
describes
the
executive
as
constituting
only
some
a
check
upon
congress
though
he
puts
no
such
limitation
upon
the
other
balances
of
the
system
independently
of
experience
however
it
might
reasonably
have
been
expected
that
the
prerogatives
of
the
president
would
have
been
one
of
the
most
effectual
restraints
upon
the
power
of
congress
he
was
constituted
one
of
the
three
great
coördinate
branches
of
the
government
his
functions
were
made
of
the
highest
dignity
his
privileges
many
and
substantial
so
great
indeed
that
it
has
pleased
the
fancy
of
some
writers
to
parade
them
as
exceeding
those
of
the
british
crown
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
had
the
presidential
chair
always
been
filled
by
men
of
commanding
character
of
acknowledged
ability
and
of
thorough
political
training
it
would
have
continued
to
be
a
seat
of
the
highest
authority
and
consideration
the
true
centre
of
the
federal
structure
the
real
throne
of
administration
and
the
frequent
source
of
policies
washington
and
his
cabinet
commanded
the
ear
of
congress
and
gave
shape
to
its
deliberations
adams
though
often
crossed
and
thwarted
gave
character
to
the
government
and
jefferson
as
president
no
less
than
as
secretary
of
state
was
the
real
leader
of
his
party
but
the
prestige
of
the
presidential
office
has
declined
with
the
character
of
the
presidents
and
the
character
of
the
presidents
has
declined
as
the
perfection
of
selfish
party
tactics
has
advanced
it
was
inevitable
that
it
should
be
so
after
independence
of
choice
on
the
part
of
the
presidential
electors
had
given
place
to
the
choice
of
presidential
candidates
by
party
conventions
it
became
absolutely
necessary
in
the
eyes
of
politicians
and
more
and
more
necessary
as
time
went
on
to
make
expediency
and
availability
the
only
rules
of
selection
as
each
party
when
in
convention
assembled
spoke
only
those
opinions
which
seemed
to
have
received
the
sanction
of
the
general
voice
carefully
suppressing
in
its
platform
all
unpopular
political
tenets
and
scrupulously
omitting
mention
of
every
doctrine
that
might
be
looked
upon
as
characteristic
and
as
part
of
a
peculiar
and
original
programme
so
when
the
presidential
candidate
came
to
be
chosen
it
was
recognized
as
imperatively
necessary
that
he
should
have
as
short
a
political
record
as
possible
and
that
he
should
wear
a
clean
and
irreproachable
insignificance
gentlemen
said
a
distinguished
american
public
man
i
would
make
an
excellent
president
but
a
very
poor
candidate
a
decisive
career
which
gives
a
man
a
place
in
public
estimation
constitutes
a
positive
disability
for
the
presidency
because
candidacy
must
precede
election
and
the
shoals
of
candidacy
can
be
passed
only
by
a
light
boat
which
carries
little
freight
and
can
be
turned
readily
about
to
suit
the
intricacies
of
the
passage
i
am
disposed
to
think
however
that
the
decline
in
the
character
of
the
presidents
is
not
the
cause
but
only
the
accompanying
manifestation
of
the
declining
prestige
of
the
presidential
office
that
high
office
has
fallen
from
its
first
estate
of
dignity
because
its
power
has
waned
and
its
power
has
waned
because
the
power
of
congress
has
become
predominant
the
early
presidents
were
as
i
have
said
men
of
such
a
stamp
that
they
would
under
any
circumstances
have
made
their
influence
felt
but
their
opportunities
were
exceptional
what
with
quarreling
and
fighting
with
england
buying
louisiana
and
florida
building
dykes
to
keep
out
the
flood
of
the
french
revolution
and
extricating
the
country
from
ceaseless
broils
with
the
south
american
republics
the
government
was
as
has
been
pointed
out
constantly
busy
during
the
first
quarter
century
of
its
existence
with
the
adjustment
of
foreign
relations
and
with
foreign
relations
of
course
the
presidents
had
everything
to
do
since
theirs
was
the
office
of
negotiation
moreover
as
regards
home
policy
also
those
times
were
not
like
ours
congress
was
somewhat
awkward
in
exercising
its
untried
powers
and
its
machinery
was
new
and
without
that
fine
adjustment
which
has
since
made
it
perfect
of
its
kind
not
having
as
yet
learned
the
art
of
governing
itself
to
the
best
advantage
and
being
without
that
facility
of
legislation
which
it
afterwards
acquired
the
legislature
was
glad
to
get
guidance
and
suggestions
of
policy
from
the
executive
but
this
state
of
things
did
not
last
long
congress
was
very
quick
and
apt
in
learning
what
it
could
do
and
in
getting
into
thoroughly
good
trim
to
do
it
it
very
early
divided
itself
into
standing
committees
which
it
equipped
with
very
comprehensive
and
privileges
of
legislative
initiative
and
control
and
set
itself
through
these
to
administer
the
government
congress
is
to
adopt
description
of
parliament
nothing
less
than
a
big
meeting
of
more
or
less
idle
people
in
proportion
as
you
give
it
power
it
will
inquire
into
everything
settle
everything
meddle
in
everything
in
an
ordinary
despotism
the
powers
of
the
despot
are
limited
by
his
bodily
capacity
and
by
the
calls
of
pleasure
he
is
but
one
man
there
are
but
twelve
hours
in
his
day
and
he
is
not
disposed
to
employ
more
than
a
small
part
in
dull
business
he
keeps
the
rest
for
the
court
or
the
harem
or
for
society
but
congress
is
a
despot
who
has
unlimited
time
who
has
unlimited
vanity
who
has
or
believes
he
has
unlimited
comprehension
whose
pleasure
is
in
action
whose
life
is
work
accordingly
it
has
entered
more
and
more
into
the
details
of
administration
until
it
has
virtually
taken
into
its
own
hands
all
the
substantial
powers
of
government
it
does
not
domineer
over
the
president
himself
but
it
makes
the
secretaries
its
humble
servants
not
that
it
would
hesitate
upon
occasion
to
deal
directly
with
the
chief
magistrate
himself
but
it
has
few
calls
to
do
so
because
our
presidents
live
by
proxy
they
are
the
executive
in
theory
but
the
secretaries
are
the
executive
in
fact
at
the
very
first
session
of
congress
steps
were
taken
towards
parceling
out
executive
work
amongst
several
departments
according
to
a
then
sufficiently
thorough
division
of
labor
and
if
the
president
of
that
day
was
not
able
to
direct
administrative
details
of
course
the
president
of
is
infinitely
less
able
to
do
so
and
must
content
himself
with
such
general
supervision
as
he
may
find
time
to
exercise
he
is
in
all
concerns
shielded
by
the
responsibility
of
his
subordinates
it
can
not
be
said
that
this
change
has
raised
the
cabinet
in
dignity
or
power
it
has
only
altered
their
relations
to
the
scheme
of
government
the
members
of
the
president
cabinet
have
always
been
prominent
in
administration
and
certainly
the
early
cabinets
were
no
less
strong
in
political
influence
than
are
the
cabinets
of
our
own
day
but
they
were
then
only
the
president
advisers
whereas
they
are
now
rather
the
president
colleagues
the
president
is
now
scarcely
the
executive
he
is
the
head
of
the
administration
he
appoints
the
executive
of
course
this
is
not
a
legal
principle
it
is
only
a
fact
in
legal
theory
the
president
can
control
every
operation
of
every
department
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
but
in
fact
it
is
not
practicable
for
him
to
do
so
and
a
limitation
of
fact
is
as
potent
as
a
prohibition
of
law
but
though
the
heads
of
the
executive
departments
are
thus
no
longer
simply
the
counselors
of
the
president
having
become
in
a
very
real
sense
members
of
the
executive
their
guiding
power
in
the
conduct
of
affairs
instead
of
advancing
has
steadily
diminished
because
while
they
were
being
made
integral
parts
of
the
machinery
of
administration
congress
was
extending
its
own
sphere
of
activity
was
getting
into
the
habit
of
investigating
and
managing
every
thing
the
executive
was
losing
and
congress
gaining
weight
and
the
station
to
which
cabinets
finally
attained
was
a
station
of
diminished
and
diminishing
power
there
is
no
distincter
tendency
in
congressional
history
than
the
tendency
to
subject
even
the
details
of
administration
to
the
constant
supervision
and
all
policy
to
the
watchful
intervention
of
the
standing
committees
i
am
inclined
to
think
therefore
that
the
enlarged
powers
of
congress
are
the
fruits
rather
of
an
immensely
increased
efficiency
of
organization
and
of
the
redoubled
activity
consequent
upon
the
facility
of
action
secured
by
such
organization
than
of
any
definite
and
persistent
scheme
of
conscious
usurpation
it
is
safe
to
say
that
congress
always
had
the
desire
to
have
a
hand
in
every
affair
of
federal
government
but
it
was
only
by
degrees
that
it
found
means
and
opportunity
to
gratify
that
desire
and
its
activity
extending
its
bounds
wherever
perfected
processes
of
congressional
work
offered
favoring
prospects
has
been
enlarged
so
naturally
and
so
silently
that
it
has
almost
always
seemed
of
normal
extent
and
has
never
except
perhaps
during
one
or
two
brief
periods
of
extraordinary
political
disturbance
appeared
to
reach
much
beyond
its
acknowledged
constitutional
sphere
it
is
only
in
the
exercise
of
those
functions
of
public
and
formal
consultation
and
coöperation
with
the
president
which
are
the
peculiar
offices
of
the
senate
that
the
power
of
congress
has
made
itself
offensive
to
popular
conceptions
of
constitutional
propriety
because
it
is
only
in
the
exercise
of
such
functions
that
congress
is
compelled
to
be
overt
and
demonstrative
in
its
claims
of
the
house
of
representatives
has
made
very
few
noisy
demonstrations
of
its
usurped
right
of
ascendency
not
because
it
was
diffident
or
unambitious
but
because
it
could
maintain
and
extend
its
prerogatives
quite
as
satisfactorily
without
noise
whereas
the
aggressive
policy
of
the
senate
has
in
the
acts
of
its
executive
sessions
necessarily
been
overt
in
spite
of
the
closing
of
the
doors
because
when
acting
as
the
president
council
in
the
ratification
of
treaties
and
in
appointments
to
office
its
competition
for
power
has
been
more
formally
and
directly
a
contest
with
the
executive
than
were
those
really
more
significant
legislative
acts
by
which
in
conjunction
with
the
house
it
has
habitually
forced
the
heads
of
the
executive
departments
to
observe
the
will
of
congress
at
every
important
turn
of
policy
hence
it
is
that
to
the
superficial
view
it
appears
that
only
the
senate
has
been
outrageous
in
its
encroachments
upon
executive
privilege
it
is
not
often
easy
to
see
the
true
constitutional
bearing
of
strictly
legislative
action
but
it
is
patent
even
to
the
least
observant
that
in
the
matter
of
appointments
to
office
for
instance
senators
have
often
outrun
their
legal
right
to
give
or
withhold
their
assent
to
appointments
by
insisting
upon
being
first
consulted
concerning
nominations
as
well
and
have
thus
made
their
constitutional
assent
to
appointments
dependent
upon
an
unconstitutional
control
of
nominations
this
particular
usurpation
has
been
put
upon
a
very
solid
basis
of
law
by
that
act
which
took
away
from
president
johnson
in
an
hour
of
party
heat
and
passion
that
independent
power
of
removal
from
office
with
which
the
constitution
had
invested
him
but
which
he
had
used
in
a
way
that
exasperated
a
senate
not
of
his
own
way
of
thinking
but
though
this
teasing
power
of
the
senate
in
the
matter
of
the
federal
patronage
is
repugnant
enough
to
the
original
theory
of
the
constitution
it
is
likely
to
be
quite
nullified
by
that
policy
of
reform
which
has
gained
so
firm
and
mayhap
so
lasting
a
footing
in
our
national
legislation
and
in
no
event
would
the
control
of
the
patronage
by
the
senate
have
unbalanced
the
federal
system
more
seriously
than
it
may
some
day
be
unbalanced
by
an
irresponsible
exertion
of
that
body
powers
in
regard
to
the
foreign
policy
of
the
government
more
than
one
passage
in
the
history
of
our
foreign
relations
illustrates
the
danger
during
the
single
congressional
session
of
for
example
the
power
of
the
senate
was
exerted
in
a
way
that
made
the
comparative
weakness
of
the
executive
very
conspicuous
and
was
ominous
of
very
serious
results
it
showed
the
executive
in
the
right
but
feeble
and
irresolute
the
senate
masterful
though
in
the
wrong
denmark
had
been
asked
to
part
with
the
island
of
thomas
to
the
united
states
and
had
at
first
refused
all
terms
not
only
because
she
cared
little
for
the
price
but
also
and
principally
because
such
a
sale
as
that
proposed
was
opposed
to
the
established
policy
of
the
powers
of
western
europe
in
whose
favor
denmark
wished
to
stand
but
finally
by
stress
of
persistent
and
importunate
negotiation
she
had
been
induced
to
yield
a
treaty
had
been
signed
and
sent
to
the
senate
the
people
of
thomas
had
signified
their
consent
to
the
cession
by
a
formal
vote
and
the
island
had
been
actually
transferred
to
an
authorized
agent
of
our
government
upon
the
faith
on
the
part
of
the
danish
ministers
that
our
representatives
would
not
have
trifled
with
them
by
entering
upon
an
important
business
transaction
which
they
were
not
assured
of
their
ability
to
conclude
but
the
senate
let
the
treaty
lie
neglected
in
its
the
limit
of
time
agreed
upon
for
confirmation
passed
the
danish
government
at
last
bent
upon
escaping
the
ridiculous
humiliation
that
would
follow
a
failure
of
the
business
at
that
stage
extended
the
time
and
even
sent
over
one
of
its
most
eminent
ministers
of
state
to
urge
the
negotiation
by
all
dignified
means
but
the
senate
cared
nothing
for
danish
feelings
and
could
afford
it
thought
to
despise
president
grant
and
mr
fish
and
at
the
next
session
rejected
the
treaty
and
left
the
danes
to
repossess
themselves
of
the
island
which
we
had
concluded
not
to
buy
after
all
it
was
during
this
same
session
of
that
the
senate
teased
the
executive
by
throwing
every
possible
obstacle
in
the
way
of
the
confirmation
of
the
much
more
important
treaty
with
great
britain
relative
to
the
alabama
claims
nearly
marring
for
good
and
all
one
of
the
most
satisfactory
successes
of
our
recent
foreign
policy
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
dwell
at
length
upon
these
incidents
of
our
later
history
inasmuch
as
these
are
only
two
of
innumerable
instances
which
make
it
safe
to
say
that
from
whatever
point
we
view
the
relations
of
the
executive
and
the
legislature
it
is
evident
that
the
power
of
the
latter
has
steadily
increased
at
the
expense
of
the
prerogatives
of
the
former
and
that
the
degree
in
which
the
one
of
these
great
branches
of
government
is
balanced
against
the
other
is
a
very
insignificant
degree
indeed
for
in
the
exercise
of
his
power
of
veto
which
is
of
course
beyond
all
comparison
his
most
formidable
prerogative
the
president
acts
not
as
the
executive
but
as
a
third
branch
of
the
legislature
as
oliver
ellsworth
said
at
the
first
session
of
the
senate
the
president
is
as
regards
the
passage
of
bills
but
a
part
of
congress
and
he
can
be
an
efficient
imperative
member
of
the
legislative
system
only
in
quiet
times
when
parties
are
pretty
evenly
balanced
and
there
are
no
indomitable
majorities
to
tread
obnoxious
vetoes
under
foot
even
this
rapid
outline
sketch
of
the
two
pictures
of
the
theory
and
of
the
actual
practices
of
the
constitution
has
been
sufficient
therefore
to
show
the
most
marked
points
of
difference
between
the
two
and
to
justify
that
careful
study
of
congressional
government
as
the
real
government
of
the
union
which
i
am
about
to
undertake
the
balances
of
the
constitution
are
for
the
most
part
only
ideal
for
all
practical
purposes
the
national
government
is
supreme
over
the
state
governments
and
congress
predominant
over
its
coördinate
branches
whereas
congress
at
first
overshadowed
neither
president
nor
federal
judiciary
it
now
on
occasion
rules
both
with
easy
mastery
and
with
a
high
hand
and
whereas
each
state
once
guarded
its
sovereign
prerogatives
with
jealous
pride
and
able
men
not
a
few
preferred
political
advancement
under
the
governments
of
the
great
commonwealths
to
office
under
the
new
federal
constitution
seats
in
state
legislatures
are
now
no
longer
coveted
except
as
possible
approaches
to
seats
in
congress
and
even
governors
of
states
seek
election
to
the
national
senate
as
a
promotion
a
reward
for
the
humbler
services
they
have
rendered
their
local
governments
what
makes
it
the
more
important
to
understand
the
present
mechanism
of
national
government
and
to
study
the
methods
of
congressional
rule
in
a
light
unclouded
by
theory
is
that
there
is
plain
evidence
that
the
expansion
of
federal
power
is
to
continue
and
that
there
exists
consequently
an
evident
necessity
that
it
should
be
known
just
what
to
do
and
how
to
do
it
when
the
time
comes
for
public
opinion
to
take
control
of
the
forces
which
are
changing
the
character
of
our
constitution
there
are
voices
in
the
air
which
can
not
be
misunderstood
the
times
seem
to
favor
a
centralization
of
governmental
functions
such
as
could
not
have
suggested
itself
as
a
possibility
to
the
framers
of
the
constitution
since
they
gave
their
work
to
the
world
the
whole
face
of
that
world
has
changed
the
constitution
was
adopted
when
it
was
six
days
hard
traveling
from
new
york
to
boston
when
to
cross
east
river
was
to
venture
a
perilous
voyage
when
men
were
thankful
for
weekly
mails
when
the
extent
of
the
country
commerce
was
reckoned
not
in
millions
but
in
thousands
of
dollars
when
the
country
knew
few
cities
and
had
but
begun
manufactures
when
indians
were
pressing
upon
near
frontiers
when
there
were
no
telegraph
lines
and
no
monster
corporations
unquestionably
the
pressing
problems
of
the
present
moment
regard
the
regulation
of
our
vast
systems
of
commerce
and
manufacture
the
control
of
giant
corporations
the
restraint
of
monopolies
the
perfection
of
fiscal
arrangements
the
facilitating
of
economic
exchanges
and
many
other
like
national
concerns
amongst
which
may
possibly
be
numbered
the
question
of
marriage
and
divorce
and
the
greatest
of
these
problems
do
not
fall
within
even
the
enlarged
sphere
of
the
federal
government
some
of
them
can
be
embraced
within
its
jurisdiction
by
no
possible
stretch
of
construction
and
the
majority
of
them
only
by
wresting
the
constitution
to
strange
and
as
yet
unimagined
uses
still
there
is
a
distinct
movement
in
favor
of
national
control
of
all
questions
of
policy
which
manifestly
demand
uniformity
of
treatment
and
power
of
administration
such
as
can
not
be
realized
by
the
separate
unconcerted
action
of
the
states
and
it
seems
probable
to
many
that
whether
by
constitutional
amendment
or
by
still
further
flights
of
construction
yet
broader
territory
will
at
no
very
distant
day
be
assigned
to
the
federal
government
it
becomes
a
matter
of
the
utmost
importance
therefore
both
for
those
who
would
arrest
this
tendency
and
for
those
who
because
they
look
upon
it
with
allowance
if
not
with
positive
favor
would
let
it
run
its
course
to
examine
critically
the
government
upon
which
this
new
weight
of
responsibility
and
power
seems
likely
to
be
cast
in
order
that
its
capacity
both
for
the
work
it
now
does
and
for
that
which
it
may
be
called
upon
to
do
may
be
definitely
estimated
judge
cooley
in
his
admirable
work
on
the
principles
of
american
constitutional
law
after
quoting
adams
enumeration
of
the
checks
and
balances
of
the
federal
system
adds
this
comment
upon
concluding
statement
that
that
system
is
an
invention
of
our
own
the
invention
nevertheless
was
suggested
by
the
british
constitution
in
which
a
system
almost
equally
elaborate
was
then
in
force
in
its
outward
forms
that
system
still
remains
but
there
has
been
for
more
than
a
century
a
gradual
change
in
the
direction
of
a
concentration
of
legislative
and
executive
power
in
the
popular
house
of
parliament
so
that
the
government
now
is
sometimes
said
with
no
great
departure
from
the
fact
to
be
a
government
by
the
house
of
commons
but
judge
cooley
does
not
seem
to
see
or
if
he
sees
does
not
emphasize
the
fact
that
our
own
system
has
been
hardly
less
subject
to
a
gradual
change
in
the
direction
of
a
concentration
of
all
the
substantial
powers
of
government
in
the
hands
of
congress
so
that
it
is
now
though
a
wide
departure
from
the
form
of
things
no
great
departure
from
the
fact
to
describe
ours
as
a
government
by
the
standing
committees
of
congress
this
fact
is
however
deducible
from
very
many
passages
of
judge
cooley
own
writings
for
he
is
by
no
means
insensible
of
that
expansion
of
the
powers
of
the
federal
government
and
that
crystallization
of
its
methods
which
have
practically
made
obsolete
the
early
constitutional
theories
and
even
the
modified
theory
which
he
himself
seems
to
hold
he
has
tested
the
nice
adjustment
of
the
theoretical
balances
by
the
actual
facts
and
has
carefully
set
forth
the
results
but
he
has
nowhere
brought
those
results
together
into
a
single
comprehensive
view
which
might
serve
as
a
clear
and
satisfactory
delineation
of
the
constitution
of
nor
has
he
or
any
other
writer
of
capacity
examined
minutely
and
at
length
that
internal
organization
of
congress
which
determines
its
methods
of
legislation
which
shapes
its
means
of
governing
the
executive
departments
which
contains
in
it
the
whole
mechanism
whereby
the
policy
of
the
country
is
in
all
points
directed
and
which
is
therefore
an
essential
branch
of
constitutional
study
as
the
house
of
commons
is
the
central
object
of
examination
in
every
study
of
the
english
constitution
so
should
congress
be
in
every
study
of
our
own
any
one
who
is
unfamiliar
with
what
congress
actually
does
and
how
it
does
it
with
all
its
duties
and
all
its
occupations
with
all
its
devices
of
management
and
resources
of
power
is
very
far
from
a
knowledge
of
the
constitutional
system
under
which
we
live
and
to
every
one
who
knows
these
things
that
knowledge
is
very
near
ii
the
house
of
representatives
no
more
vital
truth
was
ever
uttered
than
that
freedom
and
free
institutions
can
not
long
be
maintained
by
any
people
who
do
not
understand
the
nature
of
their
own
government
like
a
vast
picture
thronged
with
figures
of
equal
prominence
and
crowded
with
elaborate
and
obtrusive
details
congress
is
hard
to
see
satisfactorily
and
appreciatively
at
a
single
view
and
from
a
single
its
complicated
forms
and
diversified
structure
confuse
the
vision
and
conceal
the
system
which
underlies
its
composition
it
is
too
complex
to
be
understood
without
an
effort
without
a
careful
and
systematic
process
of
analysis
consequently
very
few
people
do
understand
it
and
its
doors
are
practically
shut
against
the
comprehension
of
the
public
at
large
if
congress
had
a
few
authoritative
leaders
whose
figures
were
very
distinct
and
very
conspicuous
to
the
eye
of
the
world
and
who
could
represent
and
stand
for
the
national
legislature
in
the
thoughts
of
that
very
numerous
and
withal
very
respectable
class
of
persons
who
must
think
specifically
and
in
concrete
forms
when
they
think
at
all
those
persons
who
can
make
something
out
of
men
but
very
little
out
of
intangible
generalizations
it
would
be
quite
within
the
region
of
possibilities
for
the
majority
of
the
nation
to
follow
the
course
of
legislation
without
any
very
serious
confusion
of
thought
i
suppose
that
almost
everybody
who
just
now
gives
any
heed
to
the
policy
of
great
britain
with
regard
even
to
the
reform
of
the
franchise
and
other
like
strictly
legislative
questions
thinks
of
gladstone
and
his
colleagues
rather
than
of
the
house
of
commons
whose
servants
they
are
the
question
is
not
what
will
parliament
do
but
what
will
gladstone
do
and
there
is
even
less
doubt
that
it
is
easier
and
more
natural
to
look
upon
the
legislative
designs
of
germany
as
locked
up
behind
bismarck
heavy
brows
than
to
think
of
them
as
dependent
upon
the
determinations
of
the
reichstag
although
as
a
matter
of
fact
its
consent
is
indispensable
even
to
the
plans
of
the
imperious
and
domineering
chancellor
but
there
is
no
great
minister
or
ministry
to
represent
the
will
and
being
of
congress
in
the
common
thought
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
representatives
stands
as
near
to
leadership
as
any
one
but
his
will
does
not
run
as
a
formative
and
imperative
power
in
legislation
much
beyond
the
appointment
of
the
committees
who
are
to
lead
the
house
and
do
its
work
for
it
and
it
is
therefore
not
entirely
satisfactory
to
the
public
mind
to
trace
all
legislation
to
him
he
may
have
a
controlling
hand
in
starting
it
but
he
sits
too
still
in
his
chair
and
is
too
evidently
not
on
the
floor
of
the
body
over
which
he
presides
to
make
it
seem
probable
to
the
ordinary
judgment
that
he
has
much
immediate
concern
in
legislation
after
it
is
once
set
afoot
everybody
knows
that
he
is
a
staunch
and
avowed
partisan
and
that
he
likes
to
make
smooth
whenever
he
can
the
legislative
paths
of
his
party
but
it
does
not
seem
likely
that
all
important
measures
originate
with
him
or
that
he
is
the
author
of
every
distinct
policy
and
in
fact
he
is
not
he
is
a
great
party
chief
but
the
hedging
circumstances
of
his
official
position
as
presiding
officer
prevent
his
performing
the
part
of
active
leadership
he
appoints
the
leaders
of
the
house
but
he
is
not
himself
its
leader
the
leaders
of
the
house
are
the
chairmen
of
the
principal
standing
committees
indeed
to
be
exactly
accurate
the
house
has
as
many
leaders
as
there
are
subjects
of
legislation
for
there
are
as
many
standing
committees
as
there
are
leading
classes
of
legislation
and
in
the
consideration
of
every
topic
of
business
the
house
is
guided
by
a
special
leader
in
the
person
of
the
chairman
of
the
standing
committee
charged
with
the
superintendence
of
measures
of
the
particular
class
to
which
that
topic
belongs
it
is
this
multiplicity
of
leaders
this
leadership
which
makes
the
organization
of
the
house
too
complex
to
afford
uninformed
people
and
unskilled
observers
any
easy
clue
to
its
methods
of
rule
for
the
chairmen
of
the
standing
committees
do
not
constitute
a
coöperative
body
like
a
ministry
they
do
not
consult
and
concur
in
the
adoption
of
homogeneous
and
mutually
helpful
measures
there
is
no
thought
of
acting
in
concert
each
committee
goes
its
own
way
at
its
own
pace
it
is
impossible
to
discover
any
unity
or
method
in
the
disconnected
and
therefore
unsystematic
confused
and
desultory
action
of
the
house
or
any
common
purpose
in
the
measures
which
its
committees
from
time
to
time
recommend
and
it
is
not
only
to
the
unanalytic
thought
of
the
common
observer
who
looks
at
the
house
from
the
outside
that
its
doings
seem
and
without
comprehensible
rule
it
is
not
at
once
easy
to
understand
them
when
they
are
scrutinized
in
their
daily
headway
through
open
session
by
one
who
is
inside
the
house
the
member
entering
its
doors
for
the
first
time
and
with
no
more
knowledge
of
its
rules
and
customs
than
the
more
intelligent
of
his
constituents
possess
always
experiences
great
difficulty
in
adjusting
his
preconceived
ideas
of
congressional
life
to
the
strange
and
conditions
by
which
he
finds
himself
surrounded
after
he
has
been
sworn
in
and
has
become
a
part
of
the
great
legislative
machine
indeed
there
are
generally
many
things
connected
with
his
career
in
washington
to
disgust
and
dispirit
if
not
to
aggrieve
the
new
member
in
the
first
place
his
local
reputation
does
not
follow
him
to
the
federal
capital
possibly
the
members
from
his
own
state
know
him
and
receive
him
into
full
fellowship
but
no
one
else
knows
him
except
as
an
adherent
of
this
or
that
party
or
as
a
from
this
or
that
state
he
finds
his
station
insignificant
and
his
identity
indistinct
but
this
social
humiliation
which
he
experiences
in
circles
in
which
to
be
a
congressman
does
not
of
itself
confer
distinction
because
it
is
only
to
be
one
among
many
is
probably
not
to
be
compared
with
the
chagrin
and
disappointment
which
come
in
company
with
the
inevitable
discovery
that
he
is
equally
without
weight
or
title
to
consideration
in
the
house
itself
no
man
when
chosen
to
the
membership
of
a
body
possessing
great
powers
and
exalted
prerogatives
likes
to
find
his
activity
repressed
and
himself
suppressed
by
imperative
rules
and
precedents
which
seem
to
have
been
framed
for
the
deliberate
purpose
of
making
usefulness
unattainable
by
individual
members
yet
such
the
new
member
finds
the
rules
and
precedents
of
the
house
to
be
it
matters
not
to
him
because
it
is
not
apparent
on
the
face
of
things
that
those
rules
and
precedents
have
grown
not
out
of
set
purpose
to
curtail
the
privileges
of
new
members
as
such
but
out
of
the
plain
necessities
of
business
it
remains
the
fact
that
he
suffers
under
their
curb
and
it
is
not
until
custom
hath
made
it
in
him
a
property
of
easiness
that
he
submits
to
them
with
anything
like
good
grace
not
all
new
members
suffer
alike
of
course
under
this
trying
discipline
because
it
is
not
every
new
member
that
comes
to
his
seat
with
serious
purposes
of
honest
earnest
and
duteous
work
there
are
numerous
tricks
and
subterfuges
soon
learned
and
easily
used
by
means
of
which
the
most
idle
and
members
may
readily
make
such
show
of
exemplary
diligence
as
will
quite
satisfy
if
it
does
not
positively
delight
constituents
in
buncombe
but
the
number
of
congressmen
who
deliberately
court
uselessness
and
counterfeit
is
probably
small
the
great
majority
doubtless
have
a
keen
enough
sense
of
their
duty
and
a
sufficiently
unhesitating
desire
to
do
it
and
it
may
safely
be
taken
for
granted
that
the
zeal
of
new
members
is
generally
hot
and
insistent
if
it
be
not
hot
to
begin
with
it
is
like
to
become
so
by
reason
of
friction
with
the
rules
because
such
men
must
inevitably
be
chafed
by
the
bonds
of
restraint
drawn
about
them
by
the
inexorable
observances
of
the
house
often
the
new
member
goes
to
washington
as
the
representative
of
a
particular
line
of
policy
having
been
elected
it
may
be
as
an
advocate
of
free
trade
or
as
a
champion
of
protection
and
it
is
naturally
his
first
care
upon
entering
on
his
duties
to
seek
immediate
opportunity
for
the
expression
of
his
views
and
immediate
means
of
giving
them
definite
shape
and
thrusting
them
upon
the
attention
of
congress
his
disappointment
is
therefore
very
keen
when
he
finds
both
opportunity
and
means
denied
him
he
can
introduce
his
bill
but
that
is
all
he
can
do
and
he
must
do
that
at
a
particular
time
and
in
a
particular
manner
this
he
is
likely
to
learn
through
rude
experience
if
he
be
not
cautious
to
inquire
beforehand
the
details
of
practice
he
is
likely
to
make
a
rash
start
upon
the
supposition
that
congress
observes
the
ordinary
rules
of
parliamentary
practice
to
which
he
has
become
accustomed
in
the
debating
clubs
familiar
to
his
youth
and
in
the
known
to
his
later
experience
his
bill
is
doubtless
ready
for
presentation
early
in
the
session
and
some
day
taking
advantage
of
a
pause
in
the
proceedings
when
there
seems
to
be
no
business
before
the
house
he
rises
to
read
it
and
move
its
adoption
but
he
finds
getting
the
floor
an
arduous
and
precarious
undertaking
there
are
certain
to
be
others
who
want
it
as
well
as
he
and
his
indignation
is
stirred
by
the
fact
that
the
speaker
does
not
so
much
as
turn
towards
him
though
he
must
have
heard
his
call
but
recognizes
some
one
else
readily
and
as
a
matter
of
course
if
he
be
obstreperous
and
persistent
in
his
cries
of
speaker
he
may
get
that
great
functionary
attention
for
a
moment
only
to
be
told
however
that
he
is
out
of
order
and
that
his
bill
can
be
introduced
at
that
stage
only
by
unanimous
consent
immediately
there
are
but
emphatic
exclamations
of
objection
and
he
is
forced
to
sit
down
confused
and
disgusted
he
has
without
knowing
it
obtruded
himself
in
the
way
of
the
regular
order
of
business
and
been
run
over
in
consequence
without
being
quite
clear
as
to
how
the
accident
occurred
moved
by
the
pain
and
discomfiture
of
this
first
experience
to
respect
if
not
to
fear
the
rules
the
new
member
casts
about
by
study
or
inquiry
to
find
out
if
possible
the
nature
and
occasion
of
his
privileges
he
learns
that
his
only
safe
day
is
monday
on
that
day
the
roll
of
the
states
is
called
and
members
may
introduce
bills
as
their
states
are
reached
in
the
call
so
on
monday
he
essays
another
bout
with
the
rules
confident
this
time
of
being
on
their
safe
side
but
mayhap
indiscreetly
and
unluckily
for
if
he
supposes
as
he
naturally
will
that
after
his
bill
has
been
sent
up
to
be
read
by
the
clerk
he
may
say
a
few
words
in
its
behalf
and
in
that
belief
sets
out
upon
his
remarks
he
will
be
knocked
down
by
the
rules
as
surely
as
he
was
on
the
first
occasion
when
he
gained
the
floor
for
a
brief
moment
the
rap
of
speaker
gavel
is
sharp
immediate
and
peremptory
he
is
curtly
informed
that
no
debate
is
in
order
the
bill
can
only
be
referred
to
the
appropriate
committee
this
is
indeed
disheartening
it
is
his
first
lesson
in
committee
government
and
the
master
rod
smarts
but
the
sooner
he
learns
the
prerogatives
and
powers
of
the
standing
committees
the
sooner
will
he
penetrate
the
mysteries
of
the
rules
and
avoid
the
pain
of
further
contact
with
their
thorny
side
the
privileges
of
the
standing
committees
are
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
the
rules
both
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
senate
conduct
their
business
by
what
may
figuratively
but
not
inaccurately
be
called
an
odd
device
of
the
house
virtually
both
deliberates
and
legislates
in
small
sections
time
would
fail
it
to
discuss
all
the
bills
brought
in
for
they
every
session
number
thousands
and
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
even
if
time
allowed
the
ordinary
processes
of
debate
and
amendment
would
suffice
to
sift
the
chaff
from
the
wheat
in
the
bushels
of
bills
every
week
piled
upon
the
clerk
desk
accordingly
no
futile
attempt
is
made
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
the
work
is
parceled
out
most
of
it
to
the
standing
committees
which
constitute
the
regular
organization
of
the
house
some
of
it
to
select
committees
appointed
for
special
and
temporary
purposes
each
of
the
almost
numberless
bills
that
come
pouring
in
on
mondays
is
read
a
first
and
second
time
simply
perfunctorily
read
that
is
by
its
title
by
the
clerk
and
passed
by
silent
assent
through
its
first
formal
courses
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
it
to
the
proper
stage
for
commitment
and
referred
without
debate
to
the
appropriate
standing
committee
practically
no
bill
escapes
commitment
save
of
course
bills
introduced
by
committees
and
a
few
which
may
now
and
then
be
crowded
through
under
a
suspension
of
the
rules
granted
by
a
vote
though
the
exact
disposition
to
be
made
of
a
bill
is
not
always
determined
easily
and
as
a
matter
of
course
besides
the
great
committee
of
ways
and
means
and
the
equally
great
committee
on
appropriations
there
are
standing
committees
on
banking
and
currency
on
claims
on
commerce
on
the
public
lands
on
and
on
the

but
careful
and
differential
as
is
the
topical
division
of
the
subjects
of
legislation
which
is
represented
in
the
titles
of
these
committees
it
is
not
always
evident
to
which
committee
each
particular
bill
should
go
many
bills
affect
subjects
which
may
be
regarded
as
lying
as
properly
within
the
jurisdiction
of
one
as
of
another
of
the
committees
for
no
hard
and
fast
lines
separate
the
various
classes
of
business
which
the
committees
are
commissioned
to
take
in
charge
their
jurisdictions
overlap
at
many
points
and
it
must
frequently
happen
that
bills
are
read
which
cover
just
this
common
ground
over
the
commitment
of
such
bills
sharp
and
interesting
skirmishes
often
take
place
there
is
active
competition
for
them
the
ordinary
quiet
routine
of
reference
being
interrupted
by
rival
motions
seeking
to
give
very
different
directions
to
the
disposition
to
be
made
of
them
to
which
committee
should
a
bill
to
fix
and
establish
the
maximum
rates
of
fares
of
the
union
pacific
and
central
pacific
railroads
be
sent
to
the
committee
on
commerce
or
to
the
committee
on
the
pacific
railroads
should
a
bill
which
prohibits
the
mailing
of
certain
classes
of
letters
and
circulars
go
to
the
committee
on
and
because
it
relates
to
the
mails
or
to
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
because
it
proposes
to
make
any
transgression
of
its
prohibition
a
crime
what
is
the
proper
disposition
of
any
bill
which
thus
seems
to
lie
within
two
distinct
committee
jurisdictions
the
fate
of
bills
committed
is
generally
not
uncertain
as
a
rule
a
bill
committed
is
a
bill
doomed
when
it
goes
from
the
clerk
desk
to
a
it
crosses
a
parliamentary
bridge
of
sighs
to
dim
dungeons
of
silence
whence
it
will
never
return
the
means
and
time
of
its
death
are
unknown
but
its
friends
never
see
it
again
of
course
no
standing
committee
is
privileged
to
take
upon
itself
the
full
powers
of
the
house
it
represents
and
formally
and
decisively
reject
a
bill
referred
to
it
its
disapproval
if
it
disapproves
must
be
reported
to
the
house
in
the
form
of
a
recommendation
that
the
bill
do
not
pass
but
it
is
easy
and
therefore
common
to
let
the
session
pass
without
making
any
report
at
all
upon
bills
deemed
objectionable
or
unimportant
and
to
substitute
for
reports
upon
them
a
few
bills
of
the
committee
own
drafting
so
that
thousands
of
bills
expire
with
the
expiration
of
each
congress
not
having
been
rejected
but
having
been
simply
neglected
there
was
not
time
to
report
upon
them
of
course
it
goes
without
saying
that
the
practical
effect
of
this
committee
organization
of
the
house
is
to
consign
to
each
of
the
standing
committees
the
entire
direction
of
legislation
upon
those
subjects
which
properly
come
to
its
consideration
as
to
those
subjects
it
is
entitled
to
the
initiative
and
all
legislative
action
with
regard
to
them
is
under
its
overruling
guidance
it
gives
shape
and
course
to
the
determinations
of
the
house
in
one
respect
however
its
initiative
is
limited
even
a
standing
committee
can
not
report
a
bill
whose
has
not
been
referred
to
it
by
the
house
by
the
rules
or
otherwise
it
can
not
volunteer
advice
on
questions
upon
which
its
advice
has
not
been
asked
but
this
is
not
a
serious
not
even
an
operative
limitation
upon
its
functions
of
suggestion
and
leadership
for
it
is
a
very
simple
matter
to
get
referred
to
it
any
subject
it
wishes
to
introduce
to
the
attention
of
the
house
its
chairman
or
one
of
its
leading
members
frames
a
bill
covering
the
point
upon
which
the
committee
wishes
to
suggest
legislation
brings
it
in
in
his
capacity
as
a
private
member
on
monday
when
the
call
of
states
is
made
has
it
referred
to
his
committee
and
thus
secures
an
opportunity
for
the
making
of
the
desired
report
it
is
by
this
imperious
authority
of
the
standing
committees
that
the
new
member
is
stayed
and
thwarted
whenever
he
seeks
to
take
an
active
part
in
the
business
of
the
house
turn
which
way
he
may
some
privilege
of
the
committees
stands
in
his
path
the
rules
are
so
framed
as
to
put
all
business
under
their
management
and
one
of
the
discoveries
which
the
new
member
is
sure
to
make
albeit
after
many
trying
experiences
and
sobering
adventures
and
as
his
first
session
draws
towards
its
close
is
that
under
their
sway
freedom
of
debate
finds
no
place
of
allowance
and
that
his
speech
must
remain
unspoken
for
even
a
long
congressional
session
is
too
short
to
afford
time
for
a
full
consideration
of
all
the
reports
of
the
committees
and
debate
upon
them
must
be
rigidly
cut
short
if
not
altogether
excluded
if
any
considerable
part
of
the
necessary
business
is
to
be
gotten
through
with
before
adjournment
there
are
some
subjects
to
which
the
house
must
always
give
prompt
attention
therefore
reports
from
the
committees
on
printing
and
on
elections
are
always
in
order
and
there
are
some
subjects
to
which
careful
consideration
must
always
be
accorded
therefore
the
committee
of
ways
and
means
and
the
committee
on
appropriations
are
clothed
with
extraordinary
privileges
and
revenue
and
supply
bills
may
be
reported
and
will
ordinarily
be
considered
at
any
time
but
these
four
are
the
only
specially
licensed
committees
the
rest
must
take
their
turns
in
fixed
order
as
they
are
called
on
by
the
speaker
contenting
themselves
with
such
crumbs
of
time
as
fall
from
the
tables
of
the
four
committees
of
highest
prerogative
senator
hoar
of
massachusetts
whose
long
congressional
experience
entitles
him
to
speak
with
authority
calculates
that
supposing
the
two
sessions
which
make
up
the
life
of
the
house
to
last
ten
months
most
of
the
committees
have
at
their
disposal
during
each
congress
but
two
hours
apiece
in
which
to
report
upon
debate
and
dispose
of
all
the
subjects
of
general
legislation
committed
to
their
charge
for
of
course
much
time
is
wasted
no
congress
gets
immediately
to
work
upon
its
first
assembling
it
has
its
officers
to
elect
and
after
their
election
some
time
must
elapse
before
its
organization
is
finally
completed
by
the
appointment
of
the
committees
it
adjourns
for
holidays
too
and
generally
spares
itself
long
sittings
besides
there
are
many
things
to
interrupt
the
call
of
the
committees
upon
which
most
of
the
business
waits
that
call
can
proceed
only
during
the
morning
hours
the
hours
just
after
the
reading
of
the
journal
on
tuesdays
wednesdays
and
thursdays
and
even
then
it
may
suffer
postponement
because
of
the
unfinished
business
of
the
previous
day
which
is
entitled
to
first
consideration
the
call
can
not
proceed
on
mondays
because
the
morning
hour
of
mondays
is
devoted
invariably
to
the
call
of
the
states
for
the
introduction
of
bills
and
resolutions
nor
on
fridays
for
friday
is
private
bill
day
and
is
always
engrossed
by
the
committee
on
claims
or
by
other
fathers
of
bills
which
have
gone
upon
the
private
calendar
on
saturdays
the
house
seldom
sits
the
reports
made
during
these
scant
morning
hours
are
ordered
to
be
printed
for
future
consideration
in
their
turn
and
the
bills
introduced
by
the
committees
are
assigned
to
the
proper
calendars
to
be
taken
up
in
order
at
the
proper
time
when
a
morning
hour
has
run
out
the
house
hastens
to
proceed
with
the
business
on
the
speaker
table
these
are
some
of
the
plainer
points
of
the
rules
they
are
full
of
complexity
and
of
confusion
to
the
uninitiated
and
the
confusions
of
practice
are
greater
than
the
confusions
of
the
rules
for
the
regular
order
of
business
is
constantly
being
interrupted
by
the
introduction
of
resolutions
offered
by
unanimous
consent
and
of
bills
let
in
under
a
suspension
of
the
rules
still
it
is
evident
that
there
is
one
principle
which
runs
through
every
stage
of
procedure
and
which
is
never
disallowed
or
abrogated
the
principle
that
the
committees
shall
rule
without
let
or
hindrance
and
this
is
a
principle
of
extraordinary
formative
power
it
is
the
mould
of
all
legislation
in
the
first
place
the
speeding
of
business
under
the
direction
of
the
committees
determines
the
character
and
the
amount
of
the
discussion
to
which
legislation
shall
be
subjected
the
house
is
conscious
that
time
presses
it
knows
that
hurry
as
it
may
it
will
hardly
get
through
with
one
eighth
of
the
business
laid
out
for
the
session
and
that
to
pause
for
lengthy
debate
is
to
allow
the
arrears
to
accumulate
besides
most
of
the
members
are
individually
anxious
to
expedite
action
on
every
pending
measure
because
each
member
of
the
house
is
a
member
of
one
or
more
of
the
standing
committees
and
is
quite
naturally
desirous
that
the
bills
prepared
by
his
committees
and
in
which
he
is
of
course
specially
interested
by
reason
of
the
particular
attention
which
he
has
been
compelled
to
give
them
should
reach
a
hearing
and
a
vote
as
soon
as
possible
it
must
therefore
invariably
happen
that
the
committee
holding
the
floor
at
any
particular
time
is
the
committee
whose
proposals
the
majority
wish
to
dispose
of
as
summarily
as
circumstances
will
allow
in
order
that
the
rest
of
the
unprivileged
committees
to
which
the
majority
belong
may
gain
the
earlier
and
the
fairer
chance
of
a
hearing
a
reporting
committee
besides
is
generally
as
glad
to
be
pushed
as
the
majority
are
to
push
it
it
probably
has
several
bills
matured
and
wishes
to
see
them
disposed
of
before
its
brief
hours
of
opportunity
are
passed
and
gone
consequently
it
is
the
established
custom
of
the
house
to
accord
the
floor
for
one
hour
to
the
member
of
the
reporting
committee
who
has
charge
of
the
business
under
consideration
and
that
hour
is
made
the
chief
hour
of
debate
the
reporting
seldom
if
ever
uses
the
whole
of
the
hour
himself
for
his
opening
remarks
he
uses
part
of
it
and
retains
control
of
the
rest
of
it
for
by
undisputed
privilege
it
is
his
to
dispose
of
whether
he
himself
be
upon
the
floor
or
not
no
amendment
is
in
order
during
that
hour
unless
he
consent
to
its
presentation
and
he
does
not
of
course
yield
his
time
indiscriminately
to
any
one
who
wishes
to
speak
he
gives
way
indeed
as
in
fairness
he
should
to
opponents
as
well
as
to
friends
of
the
measure
under
his
charge
but
generally
no
one
is
accorded
a
share
of
his
time
who
has
not
obtained
his
previous
promise
of
the
floor
and
those
who
do
speak
must
not
run
beyond
the
number
of
minutes
he
has
agreed
to
allow
them
he
keeps
the
course
both
of
debate
and
of
amendment
thus
carefully
under
his
own
supervision
as
a
good
tactician
and
before
he
finally
yields
the
floor
at
the
expiration
of
his
hour
he
is
sure
to
move
the
previous
question
to
neglect
to
do
so
would
be
to
lose
all
control
of
the
business
in
hand
for
unless
the
previous
question
is
ordered
the
debate
may
run
on
at
will
and
his
chance
for
getting
its
measures
through
slip
quite
away
and
that
would
be
nothing
less
than
his
disgrace
he
would
be
all
the
more
blameworthy
because
he
had
but
to
ask
for
the
previous
question
to
get
it
as
i
have
said
the
house
is
as
eager
to
hurry
business
as
he
can
be
and
will
consent
to
almost
any
limitation
of
discussion
that
he
may
demand
though
probably
if
he
were
to
throw
the
reins
upon
its
neck
it
would
run
at
large
from
very
wantonness
in
scorn
of
such
a
driver
the
previous
question
once
ordered
all
amendments
are
precluded
and
one
hour
remains
for
the
of
this
same
privileged
before
the
final
vote
is
taken
and
the
bill
disposed
of
these
are
the
customs
which
baffle
and
perplex
and
astound
the
new
member
in
these
precedents
and
usages
when
at
length
he
comes
to
understand
them
the
novice
spies
out
the
explanation
of
the
fact
once
so
confounding
and
seemingly
inexplicable
that
when
he
leaped
to
his
feet
to
claim
the
floor
other
members
who
rose
after
him
were
coolly
and
unfeelingly
preferred
before
him
by
the
speaker
of
course
it
is
plain
enough
now
that
speaker
knew
beforehand
to
whom
the
representative
of
the
reporting
committee
had
agreed
to
yield
the
floor
and
it
was
no
use
for
any
one
else
to
cry
out
for
recognition
whoever
wished
to
speak
should
if
possible
have
made
some
arrangement
with
the
committee
before
the
business
came
to
a
hearing
and
should
have
taken
care
to
notify
speaker
that
he
was
to
be
granted
the
floor
for
a
few
moments
unquestionably
this
besides
being
a
very
interesting
is
a
very
novel
and
significant
method
of
restricting
debate
and
expediting
legislative
action
a
method
of
very
serious
import
and
obviously
fraught
with
constitutional
effects
the
practices
of
debate
which
prevail
in
its
legislative
assembly
are
manifestly
of
the
utmost
importance
to
a
people
for
that
legislation
which
is
not
thoroughly
discussed
by
the
legislating
body
is
practically
done
in
a
corner
it
is
impossible
for
congress
itself
to
do
wisely
what
it
does
so
hurriedly
and
the
constituencies
can
not
understand
what
congress
does
not
itself
stop
to
consider
the
prerogatives
of
the
committees
represent
something
more
than
a
mere
convenient
division
of
labor
there
is
only
one
part
of
its
business
to
which
congress
as
a
whole
attends
that
part
namely
which
is
embraced
under
the
privileged
subjects
of
revenue
and
supply
the
house
never
accepts
the
proposals
of
the
committee
of
ways
and
means
or
of
the
committee
on
appropriations
without
due
deliberation
but
it
allows
almost
all
of
its
other
standing
committees
virtually
to
legislate
for
it
in
form
the
committees
only
digest
the
various
matter
introduced
by
individual
members
and
prepare
it
with
care
and
after
thorough
investigation
for
the
final
consideration
and
action
of
the
house
but
in
reality
they
dictate
the
course
to
be
taken
prescribing
the
decisions
of
the
house
not
only
but
measuring
out
according
to
their
own
wills
its
opportunities
for
debate
and
deliberation
as
well
the
house
sits
not
for
serious
discussion
but
to
sanction
the
conclusions
of
its
committees
as
rapidly
as
possible
it
legislates
in
its
not
by
the
determinations
of
majorities
but
by
the
resolutions
of
minorities
so
that
it
is
not
far
from
the
truth
to
say
that
congress
in
session
is
congress
on
public
exhibition
whilst
congress
in
its
is
congress
at
work
habit
grows
fast
even
upon
the
unconventional
american
and
the
nature
of
the
house
of
representatives
has
by
long
custom
been
shaped
to
the
spirit
of
its
rules
representatives
have
attained
by
rigorous
to
the
perfect
stature
of
the
law
under
which
they
live
having
purged
their
hearts
as
completely
as
may
be
of
all
desire
to
do
that
which
it
is
the
chief
object
of
that
law
to
forbid
by
giving
over
a
vain
lust
after
public
discussion
the
entire
absence
of
the
instinct
of
debate
amongst
them
and
their
apparent
unfamiliarity
with
the
idea
of
combating
a
proposition
by
argument
was
recently
illustrated
by
an
incident
which
was
quite
painfully
amusing
the
democratic
majority
of
the
house
of
the
congress
desired
the
immediate
passage
of
a
pension
bill
of
rather
portentous
proportions
but
the
republican
minority
disapproved
of
the
bill
with
great
fervor
and
when
it
was
moved
by
the
pension
committee
late
one
afternoon
in
a
thin
house
that
the
rules
be
suspended
and
an
early
day
set
for
a
consideration
of
the
bill
the
republicans
addressed
themselves
to
determined
and
persistent
filibustering
to
prevent
action
first
they
refused
to
vote
leaving
the
democrats
without
an
acting
quorum
then
all
night
long
they
kept
the
house
at
on
dilatory
and
obstructive
motions
the
dreary
dragging
of
the
time
being
relieved
occasionally
by
the
amusement
of
hearing
the
excuses
of
members
who
had
tried
to
slip
off
to
bed
or
by
the
excitement
of
an
angry
dispute
between
the
leaders
of
the
two
parties
as
to
the
responsibility
for
the
not
till
the
return
of
morning
brought
in
the
delinquents
to
recruit
the
democratic
ranks
did
business
advance
a
single
step
now
the
noteworthy
fact
about
this
remarkable
scene
is
that
the
minority
were
not
manoeuvring
to
gain
opportunity
or
time
for
debate
in
order
that
the
country
might
be
informed
of
the
true
nature
of
the
obnoxious
bill
but
were
simply
fighting
a
preliminary
motion
with
silent
dogged
obstruction
after
the
whole
night
had
been
spent
in
standing
out
against
action
the
house
is
said
to
have
been
in
no
mood
for
the
debate
allowed
by
the
rules
and
a
final
vote
was
taken
with
only
a
word
or
two
said
it
was
easier
and
more
natural
as
everybody
saw
to
direct
attention
to
the
questionable
character
of
what
was
being
attempted
by
the
majority
by
creating
a
somewhat
scandalous
scene
of
which
every
one
would
talk
than
by
making
speeches
which
nobody
would
read
it
was
a
notable
commentary
on
the
characteristic
methods
of
our
system
of
congressional
government
one
very
noteworthy
result
of
this
system
is
to
shift
the
theatre
of
debate
upon
legislation
from
the
floor
of
congress
to
the
privacy
of
the
provincial
gentlemen
who
read
the
associated
press
dispatches
in
their
morning
papers
as
they
sit
over
their
coffee
at
breakfast
are
doubtless
often
very
sorely
puzzled
by
certain
of
the
items
which
sometimes
appear
in
the
brief
telegraphic
notes
from
washington
what
can
they
make
of
this
for
instance
the
house
committee
on
commerce
heard
arguments
from
the
congressional
delegation
from
such
and
such
states
in
advocacy
of
appropriations
for
river
and
harbor
improvements
which
the
members
desire
incorporated
in
the
river
and
harbor
appropriations
bill
they
probably
do
not
understand
that
it
would
have
been
useless
for
members
not
of
the
committee
on
commerce
to
wait
for
any
opportunity
to
make
their
suggestions
on
the
floor
of
congress
where
the
measure
to
which
they
wish
to
make
additions
would
be
under
the
authoritative
control
of
the
committee
and
where
consequently
they
could
gain
a
hearing
only
by
the
courteous
sufferance
of
the
in
charge
of
the
report
whatever
is
to
be
done
must
be
done
by
or
through
the
committee
it
would
seem
therefore
that
practically
congress
or
at
any
rate
the
house
of
representatives
delegates
not
only
its
legislative
but
also
its
deliberative
functions
to
its
standing
committees
the
little
public
debate
that
arises
under
the
stringent
and
urgent
rules
of
the
house
is
formal
rather
than
effective
and
it
is
the
discussions
which
take
place
in
the
committees
that
give
form
to
legislation
undoubtedly
these
siftings
of
legislative
questions
by
the
committees
are
of
great
value
in
enabling
the
house
to
obtain
undarkened
counsel
and
intelligent
suggestions
from
authoritative
sources
all
sober
purposeful
talk
upon
questions
of
public
policy
whether
it
take
place
in
congress
or
only
before
the
committees
of
congress
is
of
great
value
and
the
controversies
which
spring
up
in
the
both
amongst
the
themselves
and
between
those
who
appear
before
the
committees
as
advocates
of
special
measures
can
not
but
contribute
to
add
clearness
and
definite
consistency
to
the
reports
submitted
to
the
house
there
are
however
several
very
obvious
reasons
why
the
most
thorough
canvass
of
business
by
the
committees
and
the
most
exhaustive
and
discriminating
discussion
of
all
its
details
in
their
rooms
can
not
take
the
place
or
fulfill
the
uses
of
amendment
and
debate
by
congress
in
open
session
in
the
first
place
the
proceedings
of
the
committees
are
private
and
their
discussions
unpublished
the
chief
and
unquestionably
the
most
essential
object
of
all
discussion
of
public
business
is
the
enlightenment
of
public
opinion
and
of
course
since
it
can
not
hear
the
debates
of
the
committees
the
nation
is
not
apt
to
be
much
instructed
by
them
only
the
committees
are
enlightened
there
is
a
conclusive
objection
to
the
publication
of
the
proceedings
of
the
committees
which
is
recognized
as
of
course
by
all
parliamentary
lawyers
namely
that
those
proceedings
are
of
no
force
till
confirmed
by
the
house
a
committee
is
commissioned
not
to
instruct
the
public
but
to
instruct
and
guide
the
house
indeed
it
is
not
usual
for
the
committees
to
open
their
sittings
often
to
those
who
desire
to
be
heard
with
regard
to
pending
questions
and
no
one
can
demand
a
hearing
as
of
right
on
the
contrary
they
are
privileged
and
accustomed
to
hold
their
sessions
in
absolute
secrecy
it
is
made
a
breach
of
order
for
any
member
to
allude
on
the
floor
of
the
house
to
anything
that
has
taken
place
in
committee
unless
by
a
written
report
sanctioned
by
a
majority
of
the
committee
and
there
is
no
place
in
the
regular
order
of
business
for
a
motion
instructing
a
committee
to
conduct
its
investigations
with
open
doors
accordingly
it
is
only
by
the
concession
of
the
committees
that
arguments
are
made
before
them
when
they
do
suffer
themselves
to
be
approached
moreover
they
generally
extend
the
leave
to
others
besides
their
the
committee
on
commerce
consents
to
listen
to
prominent
railroad
officials
upon
the
subject
of
the
regulation
of
freight
charges
and
fares
and
scores
of
interested
persons
telegraph
inquiries
to
the
chairman
of
the
committee
of
ways
and
means
as
to
the
time
at
which
they
are
to
be
permitted
to
present
to
the
committee
their
views
upon
the
revision
of
the
tariff
the
speeches
made
before
the
committees
at
their
open
sessions
are
therefore
scarcely
of
such
a
kind
as
would
be
instructive
to
the
public
and
on
that
account
worth
publishing
they
are
as
a
rule
the
pleas
of
special
pleaders
the
arguments
of
advocates
they
have
about
them
none
of
the
searching
critical
illuminating
character
of
the
higher
order
of
parliamentary
debate
in
which
men
are
pitted
against
each
other
as
equals
and
urged
to
sharp
contest
and
masterful
strife
by
the
inspiration
of
political
principle
and
personal
ambition
through
the
rivalry
of
parties
and
the
competition
of
policies
they
represent
a
joust
between
antagonistic
interests
not
a
contest
of
principles
they
could
scarcely
either
inform
or
elevate
public
opinion
even
if
they
were
to
obtain
its
heed
for
the
instruction
and
elevation
of
public
opinion
in
regard
to
national
affairs
there
is
needed
something
more
than
special
pleas
for
special
privileges
there
is
needed
public
discussion
of
a
peculiar
sort
a
discussion
by
the
sovereign
legislative
body
itself
a
discussion
in
which
every
feature
of
each
mooted
point
of
policy
shall
be
distinctly
brought
out
and
every
argument
of
significance
pushed
to
the
farthest
point
of
insistence
by
recognized
leaders
in
that
body
and
above
all
a
discussion
upon
which
something
something
of
interest
or
importance
some
pressing
question
of
administration
or
of
law
the
fate
of
a
party
or
the
success
of
a
conspicuous
politician
evidently
depends
it
is
only
a
discussion
of
this
sort
that
the
public
will
heed
no
other
sort
will
impress
it
there
could
therefore
be
no
more
unwelcome
revelation
to
one
who
has
anything
approaching
a
appreciation
of
the
essential
conditions
of
intelligent
than
just
that
which
must
inevitably
be
made
to
every
one
who
candidly
examines
our
congressional
system
namely
that
under
that
system
such
discussion
is
impossible
there
are
to
begin
with
physical
and
reasons
why
debate
of
public
affairs
by
the
house
of
representatives
is
out
of
the
question
to
those
who
visit
the
galleries
of
the
representative
chamber
during
a
session
of
the
house
these
reasons
are
as
obvious
as
they
are
astonishing
it
would
be
natural
to
expect
that
a
body
which
meets
ostensibly
for
consultation
and
deliberation
should
hold
its
sittings
in
a
room
small
enough
to
admit
of
an
easy
interchange
of
views
and
a
ready
concert
of
action
where
its
members
would
be
brought
into
close
sympathetic
contact
and
it
is
nothing
less
than
astonishing
to
find
it
spread
at
large
through
the
vast
spaces
of
such
a
chamber
as
the
hall
of
the
house
of
representatives
where
there
are
no
close
ranks
of
coöperating
parties
but
each
member
has
a
roomy
desk
and
an
easy
revolving
chair
where
broad
aisles
spread
and
stretch
themselves
where
ample
areas
lie
about
the
spacious
desks
of
the
speaker
and
clerks
where
deep
galleries
reach
back
from
the
outer
limits
of
the
wide
passages
which
lie
beyond
the
bar
an
immense
capacious
chamber
disposing
its
giant
dimensions
freely
beneath
the
great
level
lacunar
ceiling
through
whose
glass
panels
the
full
light
of
day
pours
in
the
most
vivid
impression
the
visitor
gets
in
looking
over
that
vast
hall
is
the
impression
of
space
a
speaker
must
needs
have
a
voice
like
the
practical
visitor
is
apt
to
think
as
he
sits
in
the
gallery
to
fill
even
the
silent
spaces
of
that
room
how
much
more
to
overcome
the
disorderly
noises
that
buzz
and
rattle
through
it
when
the
representatives
are
assembled
a
voice
clear
sonorous
dominant
like
the
voice
of
a
clarion
one
who
speaks
there
with
the
voice
and
lungs
of
the
ordinary
mortal
must
content
himself
with
the
audience
of
those
members
in
his
own
immediate
neighborhood
whose
ears
he
rudely
assails
in
vehement
efforts
to
command
the
attention
of
those
beyond
them
and
who
therefore
can
not
choose
but
hear
him
it
is
of
this
magnitude
of
the
hall
of
the
representatives
that
those
news
telegrams
are
significant
which
speak
of
an
interesting
or
witty
speech
in
congress
as
having
drawn
about
the
speaker
listeners
from
all
parts
of
the
house
as
one
of
our
most
noted
wits
would
say
a
member
must
needs
take
a
sabbath
day
journey
to
get
within
easy
hearing
distance
of
a
speaker
who
is
addressing
the
house
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
hall
for
besides
the
space
there
are
the
noises
intervening
the
noises
of
loud
talking
and
of
the
clapping
of
hands
for
the
pages
making
the
task
of
the
member
who
is
speaking
very
like
trying
to
address
the
people
in
the
omnibuses
from
the
curbstone
in
front
of
the
astor
house
but
these
physical
limitations
to
debate
though
serious
and
real
are
amongst
the
least
important
because
they
are
amongst
the
least
insuperable
if
effective
and
public
discussions
were
considered
indispensable
by
congress
or
even
desirable
the
present
chamber
could
readily
be
divided
into
two
halls
the
one
a
commodious
where
the
members
might
chat
and
write
at
ease
as
they
now
do
in
the
house
itself
and
the
other
a
smaller
room
suitable
for
debate
and
earnest
business
this
in
fact
has
been
several
times
proposed
but
the
house
does
not
feel
that
there
is
any
urgency
about
providing
facilities
for
debate
because
it
sees
no
reason
to
desire
an
increase
of
in
view
of
the
fact
that
notwithstanding
all
the
limitations
now
put
upon
discussion
its
business
moves
much
too
slowly
the
early
congresses
had
time
to
talk
congresses
of
have
not
before
that
wing
of
the
capitol
was
built
in
which
the
representative
chamber
now
is
the
house
used
to
sit
in
the
much
smaller
room
now
empty
save
for
the
statuary
to
whose
exhibition
it
is
devoted
and
there
much
went
on
from
day
to
day
there
calhoun
and
randolph
and
webster
and
clay
won
their
reputations
as
statesmen
and
orators
so
earnest
and
interesting
were
the
debates
of
those
days
indeed
that
the
principal
speeches
delivered
in
congress
seem
to
have
been
usually
printed
at
length
in
the
metropolitan
journals
but
the
number
and
length
of
the
speeches
was
even
then
very
much
deplored
and
so
early
as
a
writer
in
the
north
american
review
condemns
what
he
calls
the
habit
of
congressional
debating
with
the
air
of
one
who
speaks
against
some
abuse
which
every
one
acknowledges
to
be
a
nuisance
eleven
years
later
a
contributor
to
the
democratic
review
declared
that
it
had
been
gravely
charged
upon
samuel
cushman
then
a
member
of
the
congress
from
new
hampshire
that
he
moves
the
previous
question
truly
continues
the
essayist
he
does
and
for
that
very
service
if
he
had
never
done
anything
else
he
deserves
a
monument
as
a
public
benefactor
one
man
who
can
arrest
a
tedious
factious
debate
is
worth
forty
who
can
provoke
or
keep
one
up
it
requires
some
moral
courage
some
spirit
and
some
tact
also
to
move
the
previous
question
and
to
move
it
too
at
precisely
the
right
point
of
time
this
ardent
and
generous
defense
of
cushman
against
the
odious
accusation
of
moving
the
previous
question
would
doubtless
be
exquisitely
amusing
to
the
chairman
of
one
of
the
standing
committees
of
the
congress
to
whom
the
previous
question
seems
one
of
the
commonest
necessities
of
life
but
after
all
he
ought
not
to
laugh
at
the
ingenuous
essayist
for
that
was
not
the
heyday
of
the
rules
they
then
simply
served
and
did
not
tyrannize
over
the
house
they
did
not
then
have
the
opportunity
of
empire
afforded
them
by
the
scantiness
of
time
which
hurries
the
house
and
the
weight
of
business
which
oppresses
it
and
they
were
at
a
greater
disadvantage
in
a
room
where
oratory
was
possible
than
they
are
in
a
vast
chamber
where
the
voice
is
drowned
amidst
the
noises
of
disorderly
inattention
nowadays
debaters
are
easily
thrust
out
of
congress
and
forced
to
resort
to
the
are
compelled
to
content
themselves
with
speaking
from
the
pages
of
the
record
instead
of
from
their
places
in
the
house
some
people
who
live
very
far
from
washington
may
imagine
that
the
speeches
which
are
spread
at
large
in
the
columns
of
the
congressional
record
or
which
their
representative
sends
them
in
pamphlet
form
were
actually
delivered
in
congress
but
every
one
else
knows
that
they
were
not
that
congress
is
constantly
granting
leave
to
its
members
to
insert
in
the
official
reports
of
the
proceedings
speeches
which
it
never
heard
and
does
not
care
to
hear
but
which
it
is
not
averse
from
printing
at
the
public
expense
if
it
is
desirable
that
constituents
and
the
country
at
large
should
read
them
it
will
not
stand
between
a
member
and
his
constituents
so
long
as
it
can
indulge
the
one
and
satisfy
the
others
without
any
inconvenience
to
itself
or
any
serious
drain
upon
the
resources
of
the
treasury
the
public
printer
does
not
object
but
there
are
other
reasons
still
more
organic
than
these
why
the
debates
of
congress
can
not
under
our
present
system
have
that
serious
purpose
of
search
into
the
merits
of
policies
and
that
definite
and
determinate
party
or
if
you
will
partisan
aim
without
which
they
can
never
be
effective
for
the
instruction
of
public
opinion
or
the
cleansing
of
political
action
the
chief
of
these
reasons
because
the
parent
of
all
the
rest
is
that
there
are
in
congress
no
authoritative
leaders
who
are
the
recognized
spokesmen
of
their
parties
power
is
nowhere
concentrated
it
is
rather
deliberately
and
of
set
policy
scattered
amongst
many
small
chiefs
it
is
divided
up
as
it
were
into
seigniories
in
each
of
which
a
standing
committee
is
the
and
its
chairman
these
petty
barons
some
of
them
not
a
little
powerful
but
none
of
them
within
reach
of
the
full
powers
of
rule
may
at
will
exercise
an
almost
despotic
sway
within
their
own
shires
and
may
sometimes
threaten
to
convulse
even
the
realm
itself
but
both
their
mutual
jealousies
and
their
brief
and
restricted
opportunities
forbid
their
combining
and
each
is
very
far
from
the
office
of
common
leader
i
know
that
to
some
this
scheme
of
distributed
power
and
disintegrated
rule
seems
a
very
excellent
device
whereby
we
are
enabled
to
escape
a
dangerous
power
and
an
untoward
concentration
of
functions
and
it
is
very
easy
to
see
and
appreciate
the
considerations
which
make
this
view
of
committee
government
so
popular
it
is
based
upon
a
very
proper
and
salutary
fear
of
power
and
those
who
most
resolutely
maintain
it
always
fight
from
the
position
that
all
leadership
in
legislation
is
hard
to
restrain
in
proportion
to
its
size
and
to
the
strength
of
its
prerogatives
and
that
to
divide
it
is
to
make
it
manageable
they
aver
besides
that
the
less
a
man
has
to
do
that
is
to
say
the
more
he
is
confined
to
single
departments
and
to
definite
details
the
more
intelligent
and
thorough
will
his
work
be
they
like
the
committees
therefore
just
because
they
are
many
and
weak
being
quite
willing
to
abide
their
being
despotic
within
their
narrow
spheres
it
seems
evident
however
when
the
question
is
looked
at
from
another
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
experience
the
more
power
is
divided
the
more
irresponsible
it
becomes
a
mighty
baron
who
can
call
half
the
country
to
arms
is
watched
with
greater
jealousy
and
therefore
restrained
with
more
vigilant
care
than
is
ever
vouchsafed
the
feeble
master
of
a
single
and
solitary
castle
the
one
can
not
stir
abroad
upon
an
innocent
pleasure
jaunt
without
attracting
the
suspicious
attention
of
the
whole
the
other
may
vex
and
harry
his
entire
neighborhood
without
fear
of
let
or
hindrance
it
is
ever
the
little
foxes
that
spoil
the
grapes
at
any
rate
to
turn
back
from
illustration
to
the
facts
of
the
argument
it
is
plain
enough
that
the
petty
character
of
the
leadership
of
each
committee
contributes
towards
making
its
despotism
sure
by
making
its
duties
uninteresting
the
senate
almost
always
discusses
its
business
with
considerable
thoroughness
and
even
the
house
whether
by
common
consent
or
by
reason
of
such
persistent
filibustering
on
the
part
of
the
minority
as
compels
the
reporting
committee
and
the
majority
to
grant
time
for
talk
sometimes
stops
to
debate
committee
reports
at
length
but
nobody
except
perhaps
newspaper
editors
finds
these
debates
interesting
reading
why
is
it
that
many
intelligent
and
patriotic
people
throughout
this
country
from
virginia
to
california
people
who
beyond
all
question
love
their
state
and
the
union
more
than
they
love
our
cousin
state
over
sea
subscribe
for
the
london
papers
in
order
to
devour
the
parliamentary
debates
and
yet
would
never
think
of
troubling
themselves
to
make
tedious
progress
through
a
single
copy
of
the
congressional
record
is
it
because
they
are
captivated
by
the
dignity
of
royal
england
with
its
nobility
and
its
court
pageantry
or
because
of
a
vulgar
desire
to
appear
better
versed
than
their
neighbors
in
foreign
affairs
and
to
affect
familiarity
with
british
statesmen
no
of
course
not
it
is
because
the
parliamentary
debates
are
interesting
and
ours
are
not
in
the
british
house
of
commons
the
functions
and
privileges
of
our
standing
committees
are
all
concentrated
in
the
hands
of
the
ministry
who
have
besides
some
prerogatives
of
leadership
which
even
our
committees
do
not
possess
so
that
they
carry
all
responsibility
as
well
as
great
power
and
all
debate
wears
an
intense
personal
and
party
interest
every
important
discussion
is
an
arraignment
of
the
ministry
by
the
opposition
an
arraignment
of
the
majority
by
the
minority
and
every
important
vote
is
a
party
defeat
and
a
party
triumph
the
whole
conduct
of
the
government
turns
upon
what
is
said
in
the
commons
because
the
revelations
of
debate
often
change
votes
and
a
ministry
loses
hold
upon
power
as
it
loses
hold
upon
the
confidence
of
the
commons
this
great
standing
committee
goes
out
whenever
it
crosses
the
will
of
the
majority
it
is
therefore
for
these
very
simple
and
obvious
reasons
that
the
parliamentary
debates
are
read
on
this
side
of
the
water
in
preference
to
the
congressional
debates
they
affect
the
ministers
who
are
very
conspicuous
persons
and
in
whom
therefore
all
the
intelligent
world
is
interested
and
they
determine
the
course
of
politics
in
a
great
empire
the
season
of
a
parliamentary
debate
is
a
great
field
day
on
which
liberals
and
conservatives
pit
their
full
forces
against
each
other
and
people
like
to
watch
the
issues
of
the
contest
our
congressional
debates
on
the
contrary
have
no
tithe
of
this
interest
because
they
have
no
tithe
of
such
significance
and
importance
the
committee
reports
upon
which
the
debates
take
place
are
backed
by
neither
party
they
represent
merely
the
recommendations
of
a
small
body
of
members
belonging
to
both
parties
and
are
quite
as
likely
to
divide
the
vote
of
the
party
to
which
the
majority
of
the
committee
belong
as
they
are
to
meet
with
opposition
from
the
other
side
of
the
chamber
if
they
are
carried
it
is
no
party
triumph
if
they
are
lost
it
is
no
party
discomfiture
they
are
no
more
than
the
proposals
of
a
mixed
committee
and
may
be
rejected
without
political
inconvenience
to
either
party
or
reproof
to
the
committee
just
as
they
may
be
passed
without
compliment
to
the
committee
or
political
advantage
to
either
side
of
the
house
neither
party
has
any
great
stake
in
the
controversy
the
only
importance
that
can
attach
to
the
vote
must
hang
upon
its
relation
to
the
next
general
election
if
the
report
concern
a
question
which
is
at
the
time
so
much
in
the
public
eye
that
all
action
upon
it
is
likely
to
be
marked
and
remembered
against
the
day
of
popular
action
parties
are
careful
to
vote
as
solidly
as
possible
on
what
they
conceive
to
be
the
safe
side
but
all
other
reports
are
disposed
of
without
much
thought
of
their
influence
upon
the
fortunes
of
distant
elections
because
that
influence
is
remote
and
problematical
in
a
word
the
national
parties
do
not
act
in
congress
under
the
restraint
of
a
sense
of
immediate
responsibility
responsibility
is
spread
thin
and
no
vote
or
debate
can
gather
it
it
rests
not
so
much
upon
parties
as
upon
individuals
and
it
rests
upon
individuals
in
no
such
way
as
would
make
it
either
just
or
efficacious
to
visit
upon
them
the
iniquity
of
any
legislative
act
looking
at
government
from
a
practical
and
rather
than
from
a
theoretical
and
point
of
view
treating
the
business
of
government
as
a
business
it
seems
to
be
unquestionably
and
in
a
high
degree
desirable
that
all
legislation
should
distinctly
represent
the
action
of
parties
as
parties
i
know
that
it
has
been
proposed
by
enthusiastic
but
not
too
practical
reformers
to
do
away
with
parties
by
some
legerdemain
of
governmental
reconstruction
accompanied
and
supplemented
by
some
rehabilitation
devoutly
to
be
wished
of
the
virtues
least
commonly
controlling
in
fallen
human
nature
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
more
difficult
and
less
desirable
than
these
amiable
persons
suppose
to
conduct
a
government
of
the
many
by
means
of
any
other
device
than
party
organization
and
that
the
great
need
is
not
to
get
rid
of
parties
but
to
find
and
use
some
expedient
by
which
they
can
be
managed
and
made
amenable
from
day
to
day
to
public
opinion
plainly
this
can
not
be
effected
by
punishing
here
and
there
a
member
of
congress
who
has
voted
for
a
flagrantly
dishonest
appropriation
bill
or
an
obnoxious
measure
relating
to
the
tariff
unless
the
punishment
can
be
extended
to
the
party
if
any
such
be
recognizable
with
which
these
members
have
voted
no
advantage
has
been
won
for
and
no
triumph
has
been
gained
by
public
opinion
it
should
be
desired
that
parties
should
act
in
distinct
organizations
in
accordance
with
avowed
principles
under
easily
recognized
leaders
in
order
that
the
voters
might
be
able
to
declare
by
their
ballots
not
only
their
condemnation
of
any
past
policy
by
withdrawing
all
support
from
the
party
responsible
for
it
but
also
and
particularly
their
will
as
to
the
future
administration
of
the
government
by
bringing
into
power
a
party
pledged
to
the
adoption
of
an
acceptable
policy
it
is
therefore
a
fact
of
the
most
serious
consequence
that
by
our
system
of
congressional
rule
no
such
means
of
controlling
legislation
is
afforded
outside
of
congress
the
organization
of
the
national
parties
is
exceedingly
and
tangible
no
one
could
wish
it
and
few
could
imagine
it
more
so
but
within
congress
it
is
obscure
and
intangible
our
parties
marshal
their
adherents
with
the
strictest
possible
discipline
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
elections
but
their
discipline
is
very
slack
and
indefinite
in
dealing
with
legislation
at
least
there
is
within
congress
no
and
therefore
no
party
organization
the
only
bond
of
cohesion
is
the
caucus
which
occasionally
whips
a
party
together
for
coöperative
action
against
the
time
for
casting
its
vote
upon
some
critical
question
there
is
always
a
majority
and
a
minority
indeed
but
the
legislation
of
a
session
does
not
represent
the
policy
of
either
it
is
simply
an
aggregate
of
the
bills
recommended
by
committees
composed
of
members
from
both
sides
of
the
house
and
it
is
known
to
be
usually
not
the
work
of
the
majority
men
upon
the
committees
but
compromise
conclusions
bearing
some
shade
or
tinge
of
each
of
the
opinions
and
wishes
of
the
of
both
parties
it
is
plainly
the
representation
of
both
parties
on
the
committees
that
makes
party
responsibility
indistinct
and
organized
party
action
almost
impossible
if
the
committees
were
composed
entirely
of
members
of
the
majority
and
were
thus
constituted
representatives
of
the
party
in
power
the
whole
course
of
congressional
proceedings
would
unquestionably
take
on
a
very
different
aspect
there
would
then
certainly
be
a
compact
opposition
to
face
the
organized
majority
committee
reports
would
be
taken
to
represent
the
views
of
the
party
in
power
and
instead
of
the
scattered
unconcerted
opposition
without
plan
or
leaders
which
now
sometimes
subjects
the
propositions
of
the
committees
to
vexatious
hindrances
and
delays
there
would
spring
up
debate
under
skillful
masters
of
opposition
who
could
drill
their
partisans
for
effective
warfare
and
give
shape
and
meaning
to
the
purposes
of
the
minority
but
of
course
there
can
be
no
such
definite
division
of
forces
so
long
as
the
efficient
machinery
of
legislation
is
in
the
hands
of
both
parties
at
once
so
long
as
the
parties
are
mingled
and
harnessed
together
in
a
common
organization
it
may
be
said
therefore
that
very
few
of
the
measures
which
come
before
congress
are
party
measures
they
are
at
any
rate
not
brought
in
as
party
measures
they
are
indorsed
by
select
bodies
of
members
chosen
with
a
view
to
constituting
an
impartial
board
of
examination
for
the
judicial
and
thorough
consideration
of
each
subject
of
legislation
no
member
of
one
of
these
committees
is
warranted
in
revealing
any
of
the
disagreements
of
the
or
the
proportions
of
the
votes
there
taken
and
no
color
is
meant
to
be
given
to
the
supposition
that
the
reports
made
are
intended
to
advance
any
party
interest
indeed
only
a
very
slight
examination
of
the
measures
which
originate
with
the
committees
is
necessary
to
show
that
most
of
them
are
framed
with
a
view
to
securing
their
easy
passage
by
giving
them
as
neutral
and
inoffensive
a
character
as
possible
the
manifest
object
is
to
dress
them
to
the
liking
of
all
factions
under
such
circumstances
neither
the
failure
nor
the
success
of
any
policy
inaugurated
by
one
of
the
committees
can
fairly
be
charged
to
the
account
of
either
party
the
committee
acted
honestly
no
doubt
and
as
they
thought
best
and
there
can
of
course
be
no
assurance
that
by
taking
away
its
congressional
majority
from
the
party
to
which
the
greater
number
of
the
belong
a
committee
could
be
secured
which
would
act
better
or
differently
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
matter
is
then
that
public
opinion
can
not
be
instructed
or
elevated
by
the
debates
of
congress
not
only
because
there
are
few
debates
seriously
undertaken
by
congress
but
principally
because
no
one
not
professionally
interested
in
the
daily
course
of
legislation
cares
to
read
what
is
said
by
the
debaters
when
congress
does
stop
to
talk
inasmuch
as
nothing
depends
upon
the
issue
of
the
discussion
the
ordinary
citizen
can
not
be
induced
to
pay
much
heed
to
the
details
or
even
to
the
main
principles
of
unless
something
else
more
interesting
than
the
law
itself
be
involved
in
the
pending
decision
of
the
if
the
fortunes
of
a
party
or
the
power
of
a
great
political
leader
are
staked
upon
the
final
vote
he
will
listen
with
the
keenest
interest
to
all
that
the
principal
actors
may
have
to
say
and
absorb
much
instruction
in
so
doing
but
if
no
such
things
hang
in
the
balance
he
will
not
turn
from
his
business
to
listen
and
if
the
true
issues
are
not
brought
out
in
eager
public
contests
which
catch
his
ear
because
of
their
immediate
personal
interest
but
must
be
sought
amidst
the
information
which
can
be
made
complete
only
by
reading
scores
of
newspapers
he
will
certainly
never
find
them
or
care
for
them
and
there
is
small
use
in
printing
a
record
which
he
will
not
read
i
know
not
how
better
to
describe
our
form
of
government
in
a
single
phrase
than
by
calling
it
a
government
by
the
chairmen
of
the
standing
committees
of
congress
this
disintegrate
ministry
as
it
figures
on
the
floor
of
the
house
of
representatives
has
many
peculiarities
in
the
first
place
it
is
made
up
of
the
elders
of
the
assembly
for
by
custom
seniority
in
congressional
service
determines
the
bestowal
of
the
principal
chairmanships
in
the
second
place
it
is
constituted
of
selfish
and
warring
elements
for
chairman
fights
against
chairman
for
use
of
the
time
of
the
assembly
though
the
most
part
of
them
are
inferior
to
the
chairman
of
ways
and
means
and
all
are
subordinate
to
the
chairman
of
the
committee
on
appropriations
in
the
third
place
instead
of
being
composed
of
the
associated
leaders
of
congress
it
consists
of
the
dissociated
heads
of
little
legislatures
to
borrow
senator
hoar
apt
name
for
the
committees
and
in
the
fourth
place
it
is
instituted
by
appointment
from
speaker
who
is
by
intention
the
chief
judicial
rather
than
the
chief
political
officer
of
the
house
it
is
highly
interesting
to
note
the
extraordinary
power
accruing
to
speaker
through
this
pregnant
prerogative
of
appointing
the
standing
committees
of
the
house
that
power
is
as
it
were
the
central
and
characteristic
inconvenience
and
anomaly
of
our
constitutional
system
and
on
that
account
excites
both
the
curiosity
and
the
wonder
of
the
student
of
institutions
the
most
esteemed
writers
upon
our
constitution
have
failed
to
observe
not
only
that
the
standing
committees
are
the
most
essential
machinery
of
our
governmental
system
but
also
that
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
representatives
is
the
most
powerful
functionary
of
that
system
so
sovereign
is
he
within
the
wide
sphere
of
his
influence
that
one
could
wish
for
accurate
knowledge
as
to
the
actual
extent
of
his
power
but
speaker
powers
can
not
be
known
accurately
because
they
vary
with
the
character
of
speaker
all
speakers
have
of
late
years
especially
been
potent
factors
in
legislation
but
some
have
by
reason
of
greater
energy
or
less
conscience
made
more
use
of
their
opportunities
than
have
others
the
speaker
privilege
of
appointing
the
standing
committees
is
nearly
as
old
as
congress
itself
at
first
the
house
tried
the
plan
of
balloting
for
its
more
important
committees
ordering
in
april
that
the
speaker
should
appoint
only
those
committees
which
should
consist
of
not
more
than
three
members
but
less
than
a
experience
of
this
method
of
organizing
seems
to
have
furnished
satisfactory
proof
of
its
impracticability
and
in
january
the
present
rule
was
adopted
that
all
committees
shall
be
appointed
by
the
speaker
unless
otherwise
specially
directed
by
the
house
the
rules
of
one
house
of
representatives
are
not
however
necessarily
the
rules
of
the
next
no
rule
lives
save
by
biennial
readoption
each
house
meets
without
rules
for
its
governance
and
amongst
the
first
acts
of
its
first
session
is
usually
the
adoption
of
the
resolution
that
the
rules
of
its
predecessor
shall
be
its
own
rules
subject
of
course
to
such
revisions
as
it
may
from
time
to
time
see
fit
to
make
speaker
power
of
appointment
accordingly
always
awaits
the
passage
of
this
resolution
but
it
never
waits
in
vain
for
no
house
however
foolish
in
other
respects
has
yet
been
foolish
enough
to
make
fresh
trial
of
electing
its
committees
that
mode
may
do
well
enough
for
the
cool
and
leisurely
senate
but
it
is
not
for
the
hasty
and
turbulent
house
it
must
always
of
course
have
seemed
eminently
desirable
to
all
thoughtful
and
experienced
men
that
speaker
should
be
no
more
than
the
judicial
guide
and
moderator
of
the
proceedings
of
the
house
keeping
apart
from
the
heated
controversies
of
party
warfare
and
exercising
none
but
an
impartial
influence
upon
the
course
of
legislation
and
probably
when
he
was
first
invested
with
the
power
of
appointment
it
was
thought
possible
that
he
could
exercise
that
great
prerogative
without
allowing
his
personal
views
upon
questions
of
public
policy
to
control
or
even
affect
his
choice
but
it
must
very
soon
have
appeared
that
it
was
too
much
to
expect
of
a
man
who
had
it
within
his
power
to
direct
affairs
that
he
should
subdue
all
purpose
to
do
so
and
should
make
all
appointments
with
an
eye
to
regarding
every
preference
but
his
own
and
when
that
did
become
evident
the
rule
was
undoubtedly
retained
only
because
none
better
could
be
devised
besides
in
the
early
years
of
the
constitution
the
committees
were
very
far
from
having
the
power
they
now
possess
business
did
not
then
hurry
too
fast
for
discussion
and
the
house
was
in
the
habit
of
scrutinizing
the
reports
of
the
committees
much
more
critically
than
it
now
pretends
to
do
it
deliberated
in
its
open
sessions
as
well
as
in
its
private
and
the
functionary
who
appointed
its
committees
was
simply
the
nominator
of
its
advisers
not
as
is
the
speaker
of
the
nominor
of
its
rulers
it
is
plain
therefore
that
the
office
of
speaker
of
the
house
of
representatives
is
in
its
present
estate
a
constitutional
phenomenon
of
the
first
importance
deserving
a
very
thorough
and
critical
examination
if
i
have
succeeded
in
what
i
have
already
said
in
making
clear
the
extraordinary
power
of
the
committees
in
directing
legislation
it
may
now
go
without
the
saying
that
he
who
appoints
those
committees
is
an
autocrat
of
the
first
magnitude
there
could
be
no
clearer
proof
of
the
great
political
weight
of
the
speaker
high
commission
in
this
regard
than
the
keen
strife
which
every
two
years
takes
place
over
the
election
to
the
speakership
and
the
intense
interest
excited
throughout
the
country
as
to
the
choice
to
be
made
of
late
years
the
newspapers
have
had
almost
as
much
to
say
about
the
rival
candidates
for
that
office
as
about
the
candidates
for
the
presidency
itself
having
come
to
look
upon
the
selection
made
as
a
sure
index
of
the
policy
to
be
expected
in
legislation
the
speaker
is
of
course
chosen
by
the
party
which
commands
the
majority
in
the
house
and
it
has
sometimes
been
the
effort
of
scheming
men
of
that
majority
to
secure
the
elevation
of
some
friend
or
tool
of
their
own
to
that
office
from
which
he
can
render
them
service
of
the
most
substantial
and
acceptable
sort
but
although
these
intrigues
have
occasionally
resulted
in
the
election
of
a
man
of
insignificant
parts
and
doubtful
character
the
choice
has
usually
fallen
upon
some
representative
party
man
of
antecedents
and
opinions
for
the
house
can
not
and
will
not
willingly
put
up
with
the
intolerable
inconvenience
of
a
weak
speaker
and
the
majority
are
urged
by
and
by
all
the
weightiest
considerations
of
expediency
as
well
as
by
a
regard
for
the
interests
of
the
public
business
to
place
one
of
their
accredited
leaders
in
the
chair
if
there
be
differences
of
opinion
within
the
party
a
choice
between
leaders
becomes
a
choice
between
policies
and
assumes
the
greatest
significance
the
speaker
is
expected
to
constitute
the
committees
in
accordance
with
his
own
political
views
and
this
or
that
candidate
is
preferred
by
his
party
not
at
all
because
of
any
supposed
superiority
of
knowledge
of
the
precedents
and
laws
of
parliamentary
usage
but
because
of
his
more
popular
opinions
concerning
the
leading
questions
of
the
day
speaker
too
generally
uses
his
powers
as
freely
and
imperatively
as
he
is
expected
to
use
them
he
unhesitatingly
acts
as
the
legislative
chief
of
his
party
organizing
the
committees
in
the
interest
of
this
or
that
policy
not
covertly
and
on
the
sly
as
one
who
does
something
of
which
he
is
ashamed
but
openly
and
confidently
as
one
who
does
his
duty
nor
does
his
official
connection
with
the
committees
cease
upon
their
appointment
it
is
his
care
to
facilitate
their
control
of
the
business
of
the
house
by
recognizing
during
the
consideration
of
a
report
only
those
members
with
whom
the
reporting
has
agreed
to
share
his
time
and
by
keeping
all
who
address
the
house
within
the
strictest
letter
of
the
rules
as
to
the
length
of
their
speeches
as
well
as
by
enforcing
all
those
other
restrictions
which
forbid
independent
action
on
the
part
of
individual
members
he
must
see
to
it
that
the
committees
have
their
own
way
in
so
doing
he
is
not
exercising
arbitrary
powers
which
circumstances
and
the
habits
of
the
assembly
enable
him
safely
to
arrogate
he
is
simply
enforcing
the
plain
letter
and
satisfying
the
evident
spirit
of
the
rules
a
student
of
roman
law
and
institutions
looking
at
the
rules
of
the
house
of
representatives
through
glasses
unaccustomed
to
search
out
aught
but
antiquities
might
be
excused
for
claiming
that
he
found
in
the
customs
of
the
house
a
striking
reproduction
of
roman
legislative
methods
the
roman
assembly
he
would
remind
us
could
not
vote
and
debate
at
the
same
time
it
had
no
privileges
of
amendment
but
had
to
adopt
every
law
as
a
whole
or
reject
it
as
a
whole
and
no
private
member
had
a
right
to
introduce
a
bill
that
being
the
exclusive
prerogative
of
the
magistrates
but
though
he
might
establish
a
parallel
satisfactory
to
himself
between
the
magistrates
of
rome
and
the
committees
at
washington
and
between
the
undebatable
unamendable
laws
of
the
ancient
and
the
undebated
unamended
laws
of
the
modern
republic
he
could
hardly
find
in
the
later
system
that
compensating
advantage
which
scholars
have
noted
as
giving
to
roman
legislation
a
clearness
and
technical
perfection
such
as
is
to
be
found
in
none
of
the
modern
codes
since
roman
laws
could
not
be
amended
in
their
passage
and
must
carry
their
meaning
plainly
to
the
comprehension
of
the
commons
clear
and
brief
drafting
was
cultivated
as
of
the
first
necessity
in
drawing
up
measures
which
were
first
to
gain
popular
approval
and
then
to
succeed
or
fail
in
accomplishing
their
ends
according
as
they
proved
workable
or
impracticable
no
such
comparison
of
our
own
with
other
systems
can
however
find
any
favor
in
the
eyes
of
a
certain
class
of
americans
who
pride
themselves
upon
being
nothing
if
not
patriotic
and
who
can
consequently
find
no
higher
praise
for
the
peculiar
devices
of
committee
government
than
that
they
are
our
own
invention
an
thing
sir
but
mine
own
no
one
will
readily
believe
however
that
congressmen
even
those
of
them
who
belong
to
this
dutiful
class
cherish
a
very
loving
admiration
for
the
discipline
to
which
they
are
nowadays
subjected
as
the
accomplished
librarian
of
congress
has
declared
the
general
conviction
may
be
said
to
exist
that
under
the
great
control
over
legislation
and
current
business
by
the
speaker
and
by
the
powerful
committee
on
appropriations
combined
with
the
rigor
of
the
rules
of
the
house
there
is
less
and
less
opportunity
for
individual
members
to
make
any
influential
mark
in
legislation
independence
and
ability
are
repressed
under
the
tyranny
of
the
rules
and
practically
the
power
of
the
popular
branch
of
congress
is
concentrated
in
the
speaker
and
a
few
very
few
expert
parliamentarians
and
of
course
members
of
congress
see
this
we
have
but
three
forces
in
this
house
exclaimed
a
jocose
member
from
the
pacific
coast
the
brahmins
of
the
committee
of
ways
and
means
not
the
brains
but
the
brahmins
of
the
house
the
mandarins
of
the
appropriations
committee
the
dignified
oligarchy
called
the
committee
on
rules
the
speaker
of
the
house
and
the
illustrious
gentleman
from
indiana
naturally
all
men
of
independent
spirit
chafe
under
the
arbitrary
restraints
of
such
a
system
and
it
would
be
much
more
philosophical
to
conclude
that
they
let
it
stand
because
they
can
devise
nothing
better
than
that
they
adhere
to
its
inconvenient
practices
because
of
their
admiration
for
it
as
an
american
invention
however
that
may
be
the
number
of
those
who
misuse
the
rules
is
greater
than
the
number
of
those
who
strive
to
reform
them
one
of
the
most
startling
of
the
prevalent
abuses
is
the
hasty
passage
of
bills
under
a
suspension
of
the
rules
a
device
by
means
of
which
says
senator
hoar
a
large
proportion
perhaps
the
majority
of
the
bills
which
pass
the
house
are
carried
through
this
practice
may
be
very
clearly
understood
by
following
further
hoar
own
words
every
monday
after
the
morning
hour
and
at
any
time
during
the
last
ten
days
of
a
session
motions
to
suspend
the
rules
are
in
order
at
these
times
any
member
may
move
to
suspend
the
rules
and
pass
any
proposed
bill
it
requires
two
thirds
of
the
members
voting
to
adopt
such
a
motion
upon
it
no
debate
or
amendment
is
in
order
in
this
way
if
two
thirds
of
the
body
agree
a
bill
is
by
a
single
vote
without
discussion
and
without
change
passed
through
all
the
necessary
stages
and
made
a
law
so
far
as
the
house
of
representatives
can
accomplish
it
and
in
this
mode
hundreds
of
measures
of
vital
importance
receive
near
the
close
of
an
exhausting
session
without
being
debated
amended
printed
or
understood
the
constitutional
assent
of
the
representatives
of
the
american
people
one
very
obvious
comment
to
be
made
upon
habits
of
procedure
so
palpably
pernicious
is
that
nothing
could
be
more
natural
under
rules
which
repress
individual
action
with
so
much
stringency
then
too
the
mills
of
the
committees
are
known
to
grind
slowly
and
a
very
quick
and
easy
way
of
getting
rid
of
minor
items
of
business
is
to
let
particular
bills
of
apparently
innocent
meaning
or
laudable
intent
run
through
without
commitment
there
must
be
some
outlet
too
through
which
the
waters
of
delayed
and
accumulated
business
may
be
drained
off
as
the
end
of
a
session
draws
near
members
who
know
how
to
take
the
house
at
an
indulgent
moment
and
can
in
a
few
words
make
out
a
case
for
the
action
they
urge
can
almost
always
secure
a
suspension
of
the
rules
to
speak
very
plainly
it
is
wonderful
that
under
such
a
system
of
government
legislation
is
not
oftener
at
sixes
and
sevens
than
it
actually
is
the
infinitely
varied
and
various
interests
of
fifty
millions
of
active
people
would
be
hard
enough
to
harmonize
and
serve
one
would
think
were
parties
efficiently
organized
in
the
pursuit
of
definite
steady
consistent
policies
and
it
is
therefore
simply
amazing
to
find
how
few
outrageously
and
fatally
foolish
how
few
bad
or
disastrous
things
have
been
done
by
means
of
our
disintegrate
methods
of
legislation
the
committees
of
the
house
to
whom
the
principal
topics
of
legislation
are
allotted
number
more
than
thirty
we
are
ruled
by
a
score
and
a
half
of
little
legislatures
our
legislation
is
conglomerate
not
homogeneous
the
doings
of
one
and
the
same
congress
are
foolish
in
pieces
and
wise
in
spots
they
can
never
except
by
accident
have
any
common
features
some
of
the
committees
are
made
up
of
strong
men
the
majority
of
them
of
weak
men
and
the
weak
are
as
influential
as
the
strong
the
country
can
get
the
counsel
and
guidance
of
its
ablest
representatives
only
upon
one
or
two
subjects
upon
the
rest
it
must
be
content
with
the
impotent
service
of
the
feeble
only
a
very
small
part
of
its
most
important
business
can
be
done
well
the
system
provides
for
having
the
rest
of
it
done
miserably
and
the
whole
of
it
taken
together
done
at
haphazard
there
could
be
no
more
interesting
problem
in
the
doctrine
of
chances
than
that
of
reckoning
the
probabilities
of
there
being
any
common
features
of
principle
in
the
legislation
of
an
opening
session
it
might
lighten
and
divert
the
leisure
of
some
ingenious
mathematician
to
attempt
the
calculation
it
was
probably
some
such
reflections
as
these
which
suggested
the
proposal
made
not
long
since
in
the
house
that
there
should
be
appointed
along
with
the
usual
standing
committees
a
new
committee
which
should
be
known
as
the
executive
committee
of
the
house
and
should
be
empowered
to
examine
and
sort
all
the
bills
reported
favorably
by
the
other
standing
committees
and
bring
them
forward
in
what
might
seem
to
it
the
order
of
their
importance
a
committee
which
should
in
short
digest
pending
measures
and
guide
the
house
in
arranging
its
order
of
business
but
it
is
seriously
to
be
doubted
whether
such
an
addition
to
the
present
organization
would
do
more
than
tighten
the
tyranny
of
committee
rule
and
still
further
restrict
freedom
of
debate
and
action
a
committee
to
superintend
committees
would
add
very
little
to
the
efficiency
of
the
house
and
would
certainly
contribute
nothing
towards
unifying
legislation
unless
the
new
committee
were
to
be
given
the
power
not
yet
thought
of
of
revising
the
work
of
the
present
standing
committees
such
an
executive
committee
is
not
quite
the
device
needed
apparently
committee
government
is
but
one
of
many
experiments
in
the
direction
of
the
realization
of
an
idea
best
expressed
so
far
as
my
reading
shows
by
john
stuart
mill
and
is
too
much
like
other
experiments
to
be
quite
as
original
and
unique
as
some
people
would
like
to
believe
there
is
said
mill
a
distinction
between
the
function
of
laws
for
which
a
numerous
popular
assembly
is
radically
unfit
and
that
of
good
laws
which
is
its
proper
duty
and
can
not
be
satisfactorily
fulfilled
by
any
other
authority
and
there
is
consequently
need
of
a
legislative
commission
as
a
permanent
part
of
the
constitution
of
a
free
country
consisting
of
a
small
number
of
political
minds
on
whom
when
parliament
has
determined
that
a
law
shall
be
made
the
task
of
making
it
should
be
devolved
parliament
retaining
the
power
of
passing
or
rejecting
the
bill
when
drawn
up
but
not
of
altering
it
otherwise
than
by
sending
proposed
amendments
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
commission
it
would
seem
as
i
have
said
that
committee
government
is
one
form
of
the
effort
now
making
by
all
peoples
to
set
up
a
satisfactory
legislative
commission
somewhat
after
this
order
and
it
might
appear
to
some
as
if
the
proposed
executive
committee
were
a
slight
approximation
to
that
form
of
the
effort
which
is
typified
in
the
legislative
functions
of
the
british
cabinet
it
can
not
of
course
be
claimed
that
the
legislative
commissions
of
the
house
of
representatives
always
answer
the
purpose
when
the
house
wants
to
get
good
laws
made
or
that
each
of
them
consists
invariably
of
a
small
number
of
political
minds
but
everybody
sees
that
to
say
that
they
fall
short
of
realizing
the
ideal
would
be
nothing
less
than
hypercritical
in
saying
that
our
committee
government
has
germinally
some
of
the
features
of
the
british
system
in
which
the
ministers
of
the
crown
the
cabinet
are
chosen
from
amongst
the
leaders
of
the
parliamentary
majority
and
act
not
only
as
advisers
of
the
sovereign
but
also
as
the
great
standing
committee
or
legislative
commission
of
the
house
of
commons
guiding
its
business
and
digesting
its
graver
matters
of
legislation
i
mean
of
course
only
that
both
systems
represent
the
common
necessity
of
setting
apart
some
small
body
or
bodies
of
legislative
guides
through
whom
a
big
meeting
may
get
laws
made
the
difference
between
our
device
and
the
british
is
that
we
have
a
standing
committee
drawn
from
both
parties
for
the
consideration
of
each
topic
of
legislation
whereas
our
english
cousins
have
but
a
single
standing
committee
that
is
charged
with
the
origination
of
legislation
a
committee
composed
of
the
men
who
are
recognized
as
the
leaders
of
the
party
dominant
in
the
state
and
who
serve
at
the
same
time
as
the
political
heads
of
the
executive
departments
of
the
government
the
british
system
is
perfected
party
government
no
effort
is
made
in
the
commons
such
as
is
made
in
the
house
of
representatives
in
the
composition
of
the
committees
to
give
the
minority
a
share
in
our
minorities
are
strongly
represented
on
the
standing
committees
the
minority
in
the
commons
is
not
represented
at
all
in
the
cabinet
it
is
this
feature
of
closely
organized
party
government
whereby
the
responsibility
for
legislation
is
saddled
upon
the
majority
which
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
gives
to
the
debates
and
action
of
parliament
an
interest
altogether
denied
to
the
proceedings
of
congress
all
legislation
is
made
a
contest
for
party
supremacy
and
if
legislation
goes
wrong
or
the
majority
becomes
discontented
with
the
course
of
policy
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
that
the
ministers
should
resign
and
give
place
to
the
leaders
of
the
opposition
unless
a
new
election
should
procure
for
them
a
recruited
following
under
such
a
system
mere
silent
voting
is
out
of
the
question
debate
is
a
primary
necessity
it
brings
the
representatives
of
the
people
and
the
ministers
of
the
crown
face
to
face
the
principal
measures
of
each
session
originate
with
the
ministers
and
embody
the
policy
of
the
administration
unlike
the
reports
of
our
standing
committees
which
are
intended
to
be
simply
the
digested
substance
of
the
more
sensible
bills
introduced
by
private
members
the
bills
introduced
into
the
house
of
commons
by
the
cabinet
embody
the
definite
schemes
of
the
government
and
the
fact
that
the
ministry
is
made
up
of
the
leaders
of
the
majority
and
represents
always
the
principles
of
its
party
makes
the
minority
only
the
more
anxious
to
have
a
chance
to
criticise
its
proposals
cabinet
government
is
a
device
for
bringing
the
executive
and
legislative
branches
into
harmony
and
coöperation
without
uniting
or
confusing
their
functions
it
is
as
if
the
majority
in
the
commons
deputized
its
leaders
to
act
as
the
advisers
of
the
crown
and
the
superintendents
of
the
public
business
in
order
that
they
might
have
the
advantage
of
administrative
knowledge
and
training
in
advising
legislation
and
drafting
laws
to
be
submitted
to
parliament
this
arrangement
enlists
the
majority
in
behalf
of
successful
administration
without
giving
the
ministers
any
power
to
coerce
or
arbitrarily
influence
legislative
action
each
session
of
the
lords
and
commons
becomes
a
grand
inquest
into
the
affairs
of
the
empire
the
two
estates
sit
as
it
were
in
committee
on
the
management
of
the
public
business
sit
with
open
doors
and
spare
themselves
no
fatigue
in
securing
for
every
interest
represented
a
full
fair
and
impartial
hearing
it
is
evident
why
public
debate
is
the
very
breath
of
life
to
such
a
system
the
ministry
tenure
of
office
depends
upon
the
success
of
the
legislation
they
urge
if
any
of
their
proposals
are
negatived
by
parliament
they
are
bound
to
accept
their
defeat
as
an
intimation
that
their
administration
is
no
longer
acceptable
to
the
party
they
represent
and
are
expected
to
resign
or
to
appeal
if
they
prefer
to
the
country
for
its
verdict
by
exercising
their
privilege
of
advising
the
sovereign
to
dissolve
parliament
and
issue
writs
for
a
new
election
it
is
consequently
inevitable
that
the
ministry
should
be
subjected
to
the
most
determined
attacks
and
the
keenest
criticisms
of
the
opposition
and
should
be
every
day
of
the
session
put
to
the
task
of
vindicating
their
course
and
establishing
anew
their
claim
to
the
confidence
of
their
party
to
shrink
from
discussion
would
be
to
confess
weakness
to
suffer
themselves
to
be
worsted
in
discussion
would
be
seriously
to
imperil
their
power
they
must
look
to
it
therefore
not
only
that
their
policy
be
defensible
but
that
it
be
valiantly
defended
also
as
might
be
expected
then
the
ministry
seldom
find
the
task
of
leading
the
house
an
easy
one
their
plans
are
kept
under
an
unceasing
fire
of
criticism
from
both
sides
of
the
house
for
there
are
independent
behind
the
ministers
as
well
as
heavy
batteries
in
front
of
them
and
there
are
many
amongst
their
professed
followers
who
give
aid
and
comfort
to
the
enemy
there
come
ever
and
again
showers
of
stinging
questions
too
from
friends
and
foes
alike
questions
great
and
small
direct
and
indirect
pertinent
and
impertinent
concerning
every
detail
of
administration
and
every
tendency
of
policy
but
although
the
initiative
in
legislation
and
the
general
direction
of
the
business
of
parliament
are
the
undisputed
prerogatives
of
the
government
as
the
ministry
is
called
they
have
not
of
course
all
the
time
of
the
house
at
their
disposal
during
the
session
certain
days
of
each
week
are
set
apart
for
the
introduction
and
debate
of
bills
brought
in
by
private
members
who
at
the
opening
of
the
session
draw
lots
to
decide
the
precedence
of
their
bills
or
motions
on
the
orders
of
the
day
if
many
draw
those
who
get
last
choice
of
time
find
the
session
near
its
end
and
private
members
days
being
absorbed
by
belated
government
measures
before
their
opportunity
has
come
and
must
content
themselves
with
hoping
for
better
fortune
next
year
but
time
is
generally
found
for
a
very
fair
and
full
consideration
of
a
large
number
of
private
members
bills
and
no
member
is
denied
a
chance
to
air
his
favorite
opinions
in
the
house
or
to
try
the
patience
of
his
by
annual
repetitions
of
the
same
proposition
private
members
generally
find
out
by
long
experience
however
that
they
can
exert
a
more
telling
influence
upon
legislation
by
pressing
amendments
to
government
schemes
and
can
effect
more
immediate
and
satisfactory
results
by
keeping
the
ministry
constantly
in
mind
of
certain
phases
of
public
opinion
than
they
could
hope
to
exert
or
effect
by
themselves
introducing
measures
upon
which
their
party
might
hesitate
to
unite
living
as
he
does
under
a
system
which
makes
it
the
minister
wisest
policy
to
allow
the
utmost
freedom
of
debate
each
member
can
take
as
prominent
a
part
in
the
proceedings
of
the
house
as
his
abilities
give
him
title
to
take
if
he
have
anything
which
is
not
merely
frivolous
to
say
he
will
have
repeated
opportunities
to
say
it
for
the
commons
cough
down
only
the
bores
and
the
talkers
for
the
sake
of
talk
the
house
of
commons
as
well
as
our
house
of
representatives
has
its
committees
even
its
standing
committees
but
they
are
of
the
sort
which
merely
investigate
and
report
not
of
the
new
american
type
which
originate
and
conduct
legislation
nor
are
they
appointed
by
the
speaker
they
are
chosen
with
care
by
a
committee
of
selection
composed
of
members
of
both
parties
the
speaker
is
kept
carefully
apart
from
politics
in
all
his
functions
acting
as
the
impartial
judicial
president
of
the
body
dignity
of
presence
courtliness
of
manner
great
physical
endurance
courage
and
impartiality
of
judgment
a
consummate
tact
and
familiarity
of
experience
with
the
written
and
unwritten
laws
of
the
house
such
are
the
qualities
of
the
ideal
speaker
when
he
takes
the
chair
he
turns
his
back
on
partisan
alliances
and
serves
both
parties
alike
with
even
hand
such
are
the
traditions
of
the
office
that
its
occupant
feels
himself
as
strictly
bound
to
unbiased
judgment
as
is
the
chiefest
judge
of
the
realm
and
it
has
become
no
uncommon
thing
for
a
speaker
of
tried
ability
to
preside
during
several
successive
parliaments
whether
the
party
to
whose
suffrages
he
originally
owed
his
elevation
remains
in
power
or
no
his
political
principles
do
not
affect
his
fitness
for
judicial
functions
the
commons
in
session
present
an
interesting
picture
constrained
by
their
habits
of
debate
to
sit
in
quarters
suitable
for
the
purpose
they
crowd
together
in
a
hall
of
somewhat
cramped
proportions
it
seems
a
place
fit
for
hand
to
hand
combats
the
cushioned
benches
on
which
the
members
sit
rise
in
close
series
on
either
side
of
a
wide
central
aisle
which
they
face
at
one
end
of
this
aisle
is
raised
the
speaker
chair
below
and
in
front
of
which
invading
the
spaces
of
the
aisle
are
the
desks
of
the
wigged
and
gowned
clerks
on
the
front
benches
nearest
the
speaker
and
to
his
right
sit
the
cabinet
ministers
the
leaders
of
the
government
opposite
on
the
front
benches
to
the
speaker
left
sit
the
leaders
of
the
opposition
behind
and
to
the
right
of
the
ministers
gather
the
majority
behind
and
to
the
left
of
their
leaders
the
minority
above
the
rear
benches
and
over
the
outer
aisles
of
the
house
beyond
the
bar
hang
deep
galleries
from
which
the
outside
world
may
look
down
upon
the
eager
contests
of
the
two
parties
which
thus
sit
face
to
face
with
only
the
aisle
between
them
from
these
galleries
the
fortunate
listen
to
the
words
of
leaders
whose
names
fill
the
ear
of
the
world
the
organization
of
the
french
assembly
is
in
the
main
similar
to
that
of
the
british
commons
its
leaders
are
the
executive
officers
of
the
government
and
are
chosen
from
the
ranks
of
the
legislative
majority
by
the
president
of
the
republic
much
as
english
cabinets
are
chosen
by
english
sovereigns
they
too
are
responsible
for
their
policy
and
the
acts
of
their
administration
to
the
chamber
which
they
lead
they
like
their
british
prototypes
are
the
executive
committee
of
the
legislative
body
and
upon
its
will
their
tenure
of
office
depends
it
can
not
be
said
however
that
the
proceedings
of
the
french
assembly
very
closely
resemble
those
of
the
british
commons
in
the
hall
of
the
deputies
there
are
no
close
benches
which
face
each
other
and
no
two
homogeneous
parties
to
strive
for
the
mastery
there
are
parties
and
parties
factions
and
factions
coteries
and
coteries
there
are
bonapartists
and
legitimatists
republicans
and
clericals
stubborn
reactionists
and
headlong
radicals
stolid
conservatives
and
vindictive
destructionists
one
hears
of
the
centre
the
right
centre
and
the
left
centre
the
right
the
left
the
extreme
right
and
the
extreme
left
some
of
these
are
of
course
mere
factions
mere
groups
of
irreconcilables
but
several
of
them
are
on
the
other
hand
numerous
and
powerful
parties
upon
whose
mutual
attractions
and
repulsions
depend
the
formation
the
authority
and
the
duration
of
cabinets
of
course
too
there
is
in
a
body
so
made
up
a
great
deal
of
combustible
material
which
the
slightest
circumstance
suffices
to
kindle
into
a
sudden
blaze
the
assembly
would
not
be
french
if
it
were
not
always
excitable
and
sometimes
uproarious
absolute
turbulence
is
so
probable
a
contingency
in
its
economy
that
a
very
simple
and
quickly
applicable
device
is
provided
for
its
remedy
should
the
deputies
lose
their
heads
altogether
and
become
unmanageable
the
president
may
on
his
and
by
that
sign
unless
calm
be
immediately
restored
the
sitting
is
adjourned
for
one
hour
at
the
expiration
of
which
time
it
is
to
be
expected
that
the
members
may
resume
the
business
of
the
day
in
a
cooler
frame
of
mind
there
are
other
rules
of
procedure
observed
in
the
chamber
which
seem
to
foreign
eyes
at
first
sight
very
novel
but
which
upon
closer
examination
may
be
seen
to
differ
from
some
of
the
practices
of
our
own
house
of
representatives
in
form
rather
than
in
essence
in
france
greater
freedom
of
speech
is
allowed
individual
members
than
is
possible
under
committee
government
but
recognition
is
not
given
to
just
any
one
who
first
gets
the
floor
and
catches
the
presiding
officer
eye
as
it
is
in
the
house
of
commons
where
none
but
the
ministers
are
accorded
any
right
of
precedence
in
gaining
a
hearing
those
who
wish
to
speak
upon
any
pending
question
inscribe
their
names
beforehand
on
a
list
in
the
keeping
of
the
president
and
the
discussion
is
usually
confined
to
those
members
who
have
inscribed
when
this
list
has
been
exhausted
the
president
takes
the
sense
of
the
chamber
as
to
whether
the
debate
shall
be
closed
the
chamber
need
not
wait
however
to
hear
all
the
gentlemen
who
have
put
their
names
upon
the
list
if
portion
of
it
tires
sooner
of
the
discussion
or
thinks
itself
sufficiently
informed
before
all
who
wish
to
inform
it
have
spoken
it
may
demand
that
the
debate
be
brought
to
an
end
of
course
such
a
demand
will
not
be
heeded
if
it
come
from
only
a
few
isolated
members
and
even
portion
may
not
interrupt
a
speaker
with
this
peremptory
call
for
what
we
should
denominate
the
previous
question
but
which
the
french
parliamentarian
knows
as
the
a
demand
for
the
is
not
debatable
one
speech
may
be
made
against
it
but
none
in
its
favor
unless
it
meet
with
very
powerful
resistance
it
is
expected
to
go
through
of
its
own
weight
even
the
however
must
give
way
if
a
member
of
the
ministry
claims
the
right
to
speak
for
a
minister
must
always
be
heard
and
after
he
has
spoken
moreover
there
must
always
be
allowed
one
speech
in
reply
neither
can
the
be
pronounced
unless
a
majority
of
the
deputies
are
present
and
in
case
of
doubt
as
to
the
will
of
the
chamber
in
the
matter
after
two
votes
have
been
taken
without
eliciting
a
and
indubitable
assent
the
discussion
is
tacitly
suffered
to
proceed
these
rules
are
not
quite
so
compulsive
and
inexorable
as
are
those
which
sustain
the
government
of
our
standing
committees
nor
do
they
seem
quite
imperative
enough
for
the
effectual
governance
of
rampant
deputies
in
their
moments
of
wildest
excitement
but
they
are
somewhat
more
rigid
than
one
would
expect
to
find
under
a
system
of
ministerial
responsibility
the
purity
of
whose
atmosphere
depends
so
directly
upon
a
free
circulation
of
debate
they
are
meant
for
a
body
of
peculiar
habits
and
a
fiery
temperament
a
body
which
is
often
brought
screaming
to
its
feet
by
the
words
of
a
passionate
speaker
which
is
time
and
again
betrayed
into
stormy
disquiet
and
which
is
ever
being
blown
about
by
every
passing
wind
of
excitement
even
in
its
minor
points
of
observance
the
chamber
is
essentially
members
do
not
speak
from
their
seats
as
we
are
accustomed
to
see
members
of
our
public
assemblies
do
but
from
the
tribune
which
is
a
conspicuous
structure
erected
near
the
desks
of
the
president
and
secretaries
a
stand
closely
resembling
those
narrow
pulpits
which
are
still
to
be
seen
in
some
of
the
oldest
of
our
american
churches
and
since
deputies
must
gain
its
commanding
top
before
they
may
speak
there
are
said
to
be
many
exciting
races
for
this
place
of
vantage
sometimes
indeed
very
unseemly
scenes
take
place
when
several
deputies
all
equally
eager
to
mount
the
coveted
stand
reach
its
narrow
steps
at
the
same
moment
and
contest
the
privilege
of
precedence
especially
if
their
friends
rally
in
numbers
to
their
assistance
the
british
house
of
commons
and
the
french
chamber
though
so
unlike
in
the
elements
which
compose
them
and
so
dissimilar
in
their
modes
of
procedure
are
easily
seen
to
be
alike
in
constitutional
significance
being
made
close
kin
by
the
principle
of
cabinet
government
which
they
both
recognize
and
both
apply
in
its
fullest
efficacy
in
both
england
and
france
a
ministry
composed
of
the
chief
officers
of
the
executive
departments
are
constituted
at
once
the
leaders
of
legislation
and
the
responsible
heads
of
administration
a
binding
link
between
the
legislative
and
executive
branches
of
the
government
in
this
regard
these
two
systems
present
a
strong
contrast
to
our
own
they
recognize
and
support
simple
straightforward
inartificial
party
government
under
a
standing
committee
of
responsible
party
leaders
bringing
legislature
and
executive
side
by
side
in
intimate
but
open
coöperation
whilst
we
preferring
to
keep
congress
and
the
departments
at
length
permit
only
a
less
direct
government
by
party
majorities
checking
party
action
by
a
complex
legislative
machinery
of
two
score
and
eight
composite
committees
the
english
take
their
parties
straight
we
take
ours
mixed
there
is
another
aspect
however
in
which
all
three
of
these
systems
are
alike
they
are

in
their
essential
purpose
which
is
to
enable
a
mass
meeting
of
representatives
to
superintend
administration
and
get
good
laws
made
congress
does
not
deal
so
directly
with
our
executive
as
do
the
french
and
english
parliaments
with
theirs
and
can
not
therefore
control
it
quite
so
effectually
there
is
a
great
deal
of
friction
amongst
the
many
wheels
of
committee
government
but
in
the
long
run
congress
is
quite
as
omnipotent
as
either
the
chamber
of
deputies
or
the
house
of
commons
and
whether
there
be
two
score
committees
with
functions
mainly
legislative
or
only
one
with

half

half

we
have

nor
at

and
dispositions
by
joint
efforts
of

no

no

no

subsisting
among
them
it
is
evidently
impossible
that
they
can
act
a
public
part
with
uniformity
perseverance
or
burke
it
requires
says
bagehot
a
great
deal
of
time
to
have
opinions
and
if
one
is
to
judge
from
the
legislative
experience
of
some
very
enlightened
nations
it
requires
more
time
to
have
opinions
about
finance
than
about
any
other
subject
at
any
rate
very
few
nations
have
found
time
to
have
correct
opinions
about
it
governments
which
never
consult
the
governed
are
usually
content
with
very
shabby
methods
of
taxation
with
any
methods
indeed
which
can
be
made
to
yield
the
desired
revenues
without
much
trouble
and
the
agents
of
a
people
are
quite
sure
to
be
too
busy
with
elections
and
party
management
to
have
leisure
to
improve
much
upon
the
practices
of
autocrats
in
regard
to
this
important
care
of
administration
and
yet
this
subject
of
finance
seems
to
be
interesting
enough
in
a
way
it
is
one
of
the
commonplaces
of
our
history
that
ever
since
long
before
we
came
westward
across
the
ocean
we
have
been
readier
to
fight
about
taxation
than
about
any
other
one
thing
than
about
a
good
many
other
things
put
together
indeed
there
are
several
sadly
bloody
spots
in
the
financial
history
of
our
race
it
could
probably
be
shown
however
if
one
cared
to
take
time
to
show
it
that
it
is
easy
to
get
vexed
about
mismanagement
of
the
finances
without
knowing
how
they
might
be
better
managed
what
we
do
not
like
is
that
we
are
taxed
not
that
we
are
stupidly
taxed
we
do
not
need
to
be
political
economists
to
get
angry
about
it
and
when
we
have
gotten
angry
about
it
in
the
past
our
rulers
have
not
troubled
themselves
to
study
political
economy
in
order
to
find
out
the
best
means
of
appeasing
us
generally
they
have
simply
shifted
the
burden
from
the
shoulders
of
those
who
complained
and
were
able
to
make
things
unpleasant
to
the
shoulders
of
those
who
might
complain
but
could
not
give
much
trouble
of
course
there
are
some
taxes
which
are
much
more
hateful
than
others
and
have
on
that
account
to
be
laid
more
circumspectly
all
direct
taxes
are
heartily
disliked
by
every
one
who
has
to
pay
them
and
as
heartily
abused
except
by
those
who
have
never
owned
an
ounce
or
an
inch
of
property
and
have
never
seen
a
the
heart
of
the
ordinary
citizen
regards
them
with
an
inborn
aversion
they
are
so
straightforward
and
peremptory
in
their
demands
they
soften
their
exactions
with
not
a
grain
of
consideration
the
consequently
is
never
esteemed
a
lovable
man
his
methods
are
too
blunt
and
his
powers
too
obnoxious
he
comes
to
us
not
with
a
please
but
with
a
must
his
requisitions
always
leave
our
pockets
lighter
and
our
hearts
heavier
we
can
not
for
the
life
of
us
help
thinking
as
we
fold
up
his
receipt
and
put
it
away
that
government
is
much
too
expensive
a
luxury
as
nowadays
conducted
and
that
that
receipt
is
incontestable
documentary
proof
of
unendurable
extortion
what
we
do
not
realize
is
that
life
would
be
robbed
of
one
of
its
chief
satisfactions
if
this
occasion
of
grumbling
were
to
be
taken
away
indirect
taxes
on
the
other
hand
offend
scarcely
anybody
it
is
one
of
the
open
secrets
of
finance
that
in
almost
every
system
of
taxation
the
indirect
overcrow
the
direct
taxes
by
many
millions
and
have
a
knack
for
levying
on
the
small
resources
of
insignificant
persons
which
direct
taxes
have
never
learned
they
know
how
to
coax
pennies
out
of
poor
people
whose
names
have
never
been
on
the
books
but
they
are
very
sly
and
have
at
command
a
thousand
successful
disguises
high
or
complicated
tariffs
afford
them
their
most
frequent
and
abundant
opportunities
most
people
have
very
short
thoughts
which
do
not
extend
beyond
the
immediate
phenomena
of
direct
vision
and
so
do
not
recognize
the
hand
of
the
government
in
the
high
prices
charged
them
in
the
shops
very
few
of
us
taste
the
tariff
in
our
sugar
and
i
suppose
that
even
very
thoughtful
topers
do
not
perceive
the
in
their
whiskey
there
is
little
wonder
that
financiers
have
always
been
nervous
in
dealing
with
direct
but
confident
and
free
of
hand
in
laying
indirect
taxes
it
may
therefore
be
accounted
one
of
the
customary
advantages
which
our
federal
government
possesses
over
the
governments
of
the
states
that
it
has
almost
always
in
ordinary
times
derived
its
entire
revenue
from
prompt
and
facile
indirect
taxes
whilst
the
states
have
had
to
live
upon
the
tardy
and
begrudged
income
derivable
from
a
direct
levy
since
we
have
had
to
support
two
governments
it
has
been
wisely
resolved
to
let
us
as
long
as
possible
feel
the
weight
of
only
one
of
them
and
that
the
one
which
can
get
at
us
most
readily
and
at
the
same
time
be
most
easily
and
promptly
controlled
by
our
votes
it
is
a
plain
convenient
and
on
the
whole
satisfactory
division
of
domain
though
the
responsibility
which
it
throws
on
state
legislatures
is
more
apt
to
pinch
and
prove
vexatious
than
is
that
which
it
lays
upon
congress
gladstone
the
greatest
of
english
financiers
once
playfully
described
direct
and
indirect
taxes
as
two
sisters
daughters
of
necessity
and
invention
differing
only
as
sisters
may
differ
the
one
being
more
free
and
open
the
other
somewhat
more
shy
retiring
and
insinuating
and
frankly
owned
that
whether
from
a
lax
sense
of
moral
obligation
or
not
he
as
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
thought
it
not
only
allowable
but
even
an
act
of
duty
to
pay
his
addresses
to
them
both
but
our
chancellors
of
the
exchequer
the
chairmen
of
the
committee
of
ways
and
means
are
bound
by
other
traditions
of
courtship
and
have
besides
usually
shown
no
susceptibility
to
the
charms
of
the
blunt
and
forward
elder
of
these
two
sisters
they
have
been
constant
even
if
now
and
again
a
little
wayward
in
their
devotion
to
the
younger
i
suppose
that
no
one
ever
found
the
paths
of
finance
less
thorny
and
arduous
than
have
our
national
publicists
if
their
tasks
be
compared
with
those
of
european
and
english
financiers
it
is
plain
to
see
that
their
lines
have
fallen
in
pleasant
places
from
almost
the
very
first
they
have
had
boundless
resources
to
draw
upon
and
they
have
certainly
of
late
days
had
free
leave
to
spend
limitless
revenues
in
what
extravagances
they
pleased
it
has
come
to
be
infinitely
more
trouble
to
spend
our
enormous
national
income
than
to
collect
it
the
chief
embarrassments
have
arisen
not
from
deficits
but
from
surpluses
it
is
very
fortunate
that
such
has
been
the
case
because
for
the
best
management
of
the
finances
of
a
nation
when
revenue
is
scant
and
economy
imperative
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
have
financial
administration
in
the
hands
of
a
few
and
skillful
men
acting
subject
to
a
very
strict
responsibility
and
this
is
just
what
our
committee
system
does
not
allow
as
in
other
matters
of
legislation
so
in
finance
we
have
many
masters
acting
under
a
very
dim
and
inoperative
accountability
of
course
under
such
ministration
our
financial
policy
has
always
been
unstable
and
has
often
strayed
very
far
from
the
paths
of
wisdom
and
providence
for
even
when
revenue
is
superabundant
and
extravagance
easy
irresponsible
fast
and
loose
methods
of
taxation
and
expenditure
must
work
infinite
harm
the
only
difference
is
that
during
such
times
the
nation
is
not
so
sensitive
to
the
ill
effects
wrought
by
careless
policy
mismanagement
is
not
generally
blamed
until
a
great
many
people
have
discovered
it
by
being
hurt
by
it
meantime
however
it
is
none
the
less
interesting
and
important
to
study
our
government
with
a
view
to
gauging
its
qualities
and
measuring
accurately
its
capabilities
for
good
or
bad
service
and
the
study
can
doubtless
be
much
more
dispassionately
conducted
before
we
have
been
seriously
hurt
by
foolish
unsteady
administration
than
afterwards
the
forces
of
the
wind
can
be
reckoned
with
much
more
readily
while
they
are
blowing
only
a
gale
than
after
they
have
thrown
a
hurricane
upon
us
the
national
income
is
controlled
by
one
committee
of
the
house
and
one
of
the
senate
the
expenditures
of
the
government
are
regulated
by
fifteen
committees
of
the
house
and
five
of
the
senate
and
the
currency
is
cared
for
by
two
committees
of
the
house
and
one
of
the
senate
by
all
of
which
it
appears
that
the
financial
administration
of
the
country
is
in
the
hands
of
committees
of
congress
a
mechanism
of
numerous
small
and
great
functions
quite
complex
enough
to
be
worth
careful
study
perhaps
too
complex
to
be
studied
directly
without
an
aiding
knowledge
of
some
simpler
system
with
which
it
may
be
compared
our
own
budget
may
be
more
readily
followed
through
all
the
vicissitudes
of
committee
scrutiny
and
all
the
varied
fortunes
of
committee
action
after
one
has
traced
some
other
budget
through
the
simpler
processes
of
some
other
system
of
government
the
british
system
is
perhaps
in
its
main
features
the
simplest
in
existence
it
is
besides
the
pattern
after
which
the
financial
systems
of
the
chief
governments
of
europe
have
been
modeled
and
which
we
have
ourselves
in
a
measure
copied
so
that
by
prefacing
the
study
of
other
systems
by
a
careful
examination
of
the
british
in
its
present
form
one
may
start
with
the
great
advantage
of
knowing
the
characteristics
of
what
may
fairly
be
called
the
parent
stock
parliament
then
in
the
first
place
simply
controls
it
does
not
originate
measures
of
financial
administration
it
acts
through
the
agency
and
under
the
guidance
of
the
ministers
of
the
crown
early
in
each
annual
session
the
estimates
are
submitted
to
the
commons
which
when
hearing
such
statements
sits
in
committee
of
the
whole
house
known
as
committee
of
supply
the
estimates
come
before
the
house
in
truly
formidable
shape
each
department
presents
its
estimates
in
a
huge
quarto
volume
crammed
with
figures
and
minute
entries
of
moneys
wanted
for
the
forthcoming
year
but
the
house
itself
does
not
have
to
digest
this
various
and
overwhelming
mass
of
figures
the
digesting
is
done
in
the
first
instance
by
the
official
leaders
of
the
house
the
ministers
in
charge
of
the
naval
and
military
services
lay
before
the
committee
of
supply
their
respective
statements
of
the
sums
which
will
be
required
for
the
maintenance
of
those
services
and
somewhat
later
in
the
session
a
common
estimate
for
the
various
civil
services
is
submitted
also
those
statements
are
as
it
were
condensed
synopses
of
the
details
of
the
quartos
and
are
made
with
the
object
of
rendering
quite
clear
to
the
house
sitting
under
the
informal
rules
of
committee
the
policy
of
the
expenditures
proposed
and
the
correctness
of
the
calculations
upon
which
they
are
based
any
member
may
ask
what
pertinent
questions
he
pleases
of
the
minister
who
is
making
the
statement
so
that
nothing
needing
elucidation
may
be
passed
by
without
full
explanation
after
the
statement
has
been
completed
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
committee
a
vote
is
taken
at
the
motion
of
the
minister
upon
each
item
of
expenditure
and
the
duties
of
the
committee
of
supply
have
been
performed
the
estimates
are
always
submitted
on
the
collective
responsibility
of
the
whole
cabinet
the
army
and
navy
estimates
have
as
a
rule
been
considered
and
settled
in
cabinet
council
before
being
submitted
to
the
house
and
the
collective
responsibility
of
the
ministry
is
in
this
case
therefore
not
technical
merely
but
substantial
if
the
estimates
are
resisted
and
rejected
by
the
committee
the
ministers
of
course
resign
they
can
not
acquiesce
in
a
refusal
on
the
part
of
parliament
to
sanction
the
expenditure
which
they
have
assumed
the
responsibility
of
declaring
necessary
for
the
support
of
the
civil
government
and
the
maintenance
of
the
public
credit
at
home
and
abroad
the
votes
in
committee
of
supply
are
therefore
vital
in
the
history
of
every
administration
being
taken
as
sure
indexes
of
the
amount
of
confidence
placed
by
the
house
in
the
government
but
the
votes
in
committee
of
supply
are
only
the
first
steps
in
parliament
annual
supervision
of
the
public
finances
they
are
simply
the
spending
votes
in
order
to
consider
the
means
by
which
money
is
to
be
raised
to
meet
the
outlays
sanctioned
by
the
committee
of
supply
the
house
resolves
itself
into
committee
of
the
whole
under
the
name
of
the
committee
of
ways
and
means
it
is
to
this
committee
that
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
submits
his
budget
every
year
on
or
soon
before
the
fifth
of
april
the
date
at
which
the
national
accounts
are
made
up
the
financial
year
closing
on
the
of
march
in
order
to
prepare
his
budget
the
chancellor
must
of
course
have
early
knowledge
of
the
estimates
made
for
the
various
services
several
months
therefore
before
the
estimates
are
laid
before
the
house
in
committee
of
supply
the
various
departments
are
called
upon
by
the
treasury
to
send
in
statements
of
the
sums
required
to
defray
the
expenses
of
the
current
year
and
these
estimates
are
carefully
examined
by
the
chancellor
with
a
view
not
only
to
exercising
his
duty
of
keeping
the
expenditures
within
the
limits
of
economy
but
also
to
ascertaining
how
much
revenue
he
will
have
to
secure
in
order
to
meet
the
proper
expenditure
contemplated
he
must
balance
estimated
needs
over
against
estimated
resources
and
advise
the
house
in
committee
of
ways
and
means
as
to
the
measures
by
which
taxation
is
to
be
made
to
afford
sufficient
revenue
accordingly
he
calls
in
the
aid
of
the
permanent
heads
of
the
revenue
departments
who
furnish
him
with
their
estimates
of
the
public
revenue
for
the
ensuing
year
upon
the
hypothesis
that
taxation
will
remain
unchanged
having
with
such
aids
made
up
his
budget
the
chancellor
goes
before
the
committee
of
ways
and
means
prepared
to
give
a
clear
history
of
the
financial
administration
of
the
year
just
closed
and
to
submit
definite
plans
for
adjusting
the
taxation
and
providing
for
the
expected
outlays
of
the
year
just
opening
the
precedents
of
a
wise
policy
of
long
standing
forbid
his
proposing
to
raise
any
greater
revenue
than
is
absolutely
necessary
for
the
support
of
the
government
and
the
maintenance
of
the
public
credit
he
therefore
never
asks
the
committee
to
lay
taxes
which
promise
a
considerable
surplus
he
seeks
to
obtain
only
such
an
of
income
as
will
secure
the
government
against
those
slight
errors
of
underestimation
of
probable
expenses
or
of
overestimation
of
probable
revenue
as
the
most
prudent
of
administrations
is
liable
to
make
if
the
estimated
revenue
considerably
exceed
the
estimated
expenses
he
proposes
such
remissions
of
taxation
as
will
bring
the
balance
as
near
equality
as
prudence
will
permit
if
the
anticipated
expenses
run
beyond
the
figure
of
the
revenue
he
asks
that
certain
new
taxes
be
laid
or
that
certain
existing
taxes
be
increased
if
the
balance
between
the
two
sides
of
the
forecast
account
shows
a
pretty
near
approach
to
equilibrium
so
the
scale
of
revenue
be
but
a
little
the
heavier
of
the
two
he
contents
himself
with
suggesting
such
a
readjustment
of
existing
taxes
as
will
be
likely
to
distribute
the
burden
of
taxation
more
equitably
amongst
the
classes
or
facilitate
hampered
collections
by
simplifying
the
complex
methods
of
assessment
and
imposition
such
is
the
budget
statement
to
which
the
house
of
commons
listens
in
committee
of
ways
and
means
this
committee
may
deal
with
the
proposals
of
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
with
somewhat
freer
hand
than
the
committee
of
supply
may
use
in
passing
upon
the
estimates
the
ministry
is
not
so
stiffly
insistent
upon
having
its
budget
sanctioned
as
it
is
upon
having
its
proposed
expenditures
approved
it
is
understood
to
pledge
itself
to
ask
for
no
more
money
than
it
honestly
needs
but
it
simply
advises
with
the
house
as
to
the
best
way
of
raising
that
money
it
is
punctiliously
particular
about
being
supplied
with
the
funds
it
asks
for
but
not
quite
so
exacting
as
to
the
ways
and
means
of
supply
still
no
ministry
can
stand
if
the
budget
be
rejected
out
of
hand
or
if
its
demands
for
the
means
of
meeting
a
deficiency
be
met
with
a
flat
refusal
no
alternative
means
being
suggested
by
the
opposition
such
votes
would
be
distinct
declarations
of
a
want
of
confidence
in
the
ministry
and
would
of
course
force
them
to
resign
the
committee
of
ways
and
means
then
carries
out
under
the
guidance
of
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
the
resolutions
of
the
committee
of
supply
the
votes
of
the
latter
committee
authorizing
the
expenditures
mapped
out
in
the
estimates
are
embodied
in
a
resolution
proposed
in
committee
of
ways
and
means
for
a
general
grant
out
of
the
consolidated
fund
making
good
the
supply
granted
to
her
majesty
and
that
resolution
in
order
that
it
may
be
prepared
for
the
consideration
of
the
house
of
lords
and
the
crown
is
afterwards
cast
by
the
house
into
the
form
of
a
bill
which
passes
through
the
regular
stages
and
in
due
course
becomes
law
the
proposals
of
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
with
reference
to
changes
in
taxation
are
in
like
manner
embodied
in
resolutions
in
committee
of
ways
and
means
and
subsequently
upon
the
report
of
the
committee
passed
by
the
house
in
the
shape
of
bills
ways
and
means
bills
generally
pass
the
lords
without
trouble
the
absolute
control
of
the
commons
over
the
subjects
of
revenue
and
supply
has
been
so
long
established
that
the
upper
house
would
not
now
dream
of
disputing
it
and
as
the
power
of
the
lords
is
simply
a
privilege
to
accept
or
reject
a
money
bill
as
a
whole
including
no
right
to
amend
the
peers
are
wont
to
let
such
bills
go
through
without
much
scrutiny
but
so
far
i
have
spoken
only
of
that
part
of
parliament
control
of
the
finances
which
concerns
the
future
the
ways
and
means
bills
provide
for
coming
expenses
and
a
prospective
revenue
past
expenses
are
supervised
in
a
different
way
there
is
a
double
process
of
audit
by
means
of
a
special
audit
department
of
the
civil
service
which
is
of
course
a
part
of
the
permanent
organization
of
the
administration
having
it
in
charge
to
examine
the
accounts
and
vouchers
of
the
entire
expenditure
and
a
special
committee
nominated
each
year
by
the
house
to
audit
the
audit
department
this
committee
is
usually
made
up
of
the
most
experienced
business
men
in
the
commons
and
before
it
all
the
accounts
of
the
completed
financial
year
are
passed
in
review
minute
inquiries
are
occasionally
made
by
it
into
the
reasons
why
certain
items
of
expenditure
have
occurred
it
discusses
claims
for
compensation
grants
and
special
disbursements
in
addition
to
the
ordinary
outgoings
of
the
department
mainly
to
be
sure
upon
the
information
and
advice
of
the
departments
themselves
but
still
with
a
certain
independence
of
view
and
judgment
which
must
be
valuable
the
strictness
and
explicitness
with
which
the
public
accounts
are
kept
of
course
greatly
facilitate
the
process
of
audit
the
balance
which
is
struck
on
the
of
every
march
is
of
the
most
definite
sort
it
deals
only
with
the
actual
receipts
and
disbursements
of
the
completed
fiscal
year
at
that
date
all
unexpended
credits
lapse
if
the
expenditure
of
certain
sums
has
been
sanctioned
by
parliamentary
vote
but
some
of
the
granted
moneys
remain
undrawn
when
april
comes
in
they
can
be
used
only
after
a
regrant
by
the
commons
there
are
therefore
no
unclosed
accounts
to
obscure
the
view
of
the
auditing
authorities
taxes
and
credits
have
the
same
definite
period
and
there
are
no
arrears
or
unexpended
balances
to
confuse
the
the
great
advantages
of
such
a
system
in
the
way
of
checking
extravagances
which
would
otherwise
be
possible
may
be
seen
by
comparing
it
with
the
system
in
vogue
in
france
in
whose
national
arrears
of
taxes
in
one
year
overlap
with
those
of
other
years
and
credits
old
jostle
credits
new
so
that
it
is
said
to
be
always
three
or
four
years
before
the
nation
can
know
what
the
definitive
expenditure
of
a
given
year
is
for
the
completion
of
this
sketch
of
financial
administration
under
the
commons
it
is
of
course
necessary
to
add
a
very
distinct
statement
of
what
i
may
call
the
of
the
financial
officers
of
the
government
they
are
always
present
to
be
questioned
the
treasury
department
is
as
becomes
its
importance
exceptionally
well
represented
in
the
house
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
the
working
chief
of
the
department
is
invariably
a
member
of
the
commons
and
can
be
called
to
account
by
interrogation
or
motion
with
respect
to
all
matters
of
treasury
concern
with
respect
that
is
to
the
whole
sphere
of
the
discipline
and
economy
of
the
executive
government
for
the
treasury
has
wide
powers
of
supervision
over
the
other
departments
in
all
matters
which
may
in
any
way
involve
an
outlay
of
public
money
and
not
only
does
the
invariable
presence
of
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
in
the
house
of
commons
make
the
representation
of
that
department
peculiarly
direct
but
through
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
with
respect
to
certain
departmental
matters
through
the
junior
lords
the
house
possesses
peculiar
facilities
for
ascertaining
and
expressing
its
opinion
upon
the
details
of
treasury
administration
it
has
its
responsible
servants
always
before
it
and
can
obtain
what
glimpses
it
pleases
into
the
inner
workings
of
the
departments
which
it
wishes
to
control
it
is
just
at
this
point
that
our
own
system
of
financial
administration
differs
most
essentially
from
the
systems
of
england
of
the
continent
and
of
the
british
colonial
possessions
congress
does
not
come
into
direct
contact
with
the
financial
officers
of
the
government
executive
and
legislature
are
separated
by
a
hard
and
fast
line
which
sets
them
apart
in
what
was
meant
to
be
independence
but
has
come
to
amount
to
isolation
correspondence
between
them
is
carried
on
by
means
of
written
communications
which
like
all
formal
writings
are
vague
or
by
means
of
private
examinations
of
officials
in
to
which
the
whole
house
can
not
be
audience
no
one
who
has
read
official
documents
needs
to
be
told
how
easy
it
is
to
conceal
the
essential
truth
under
the
apparently
candid
and
phrases
of
a
voluminous
and
particularizing
report
how
different
those
answers
are
which
are
given
with
the
pen
from
a
private
office
from
those
which
are
given
with
the
tongue
when
the
speaker
is
looking
an
assembly
in
the
face
it
is
sufficiently
plain
too
that
resolutions
which
call
upon
officials
to
give
testimony
before
a
committee
are
a
much
clumsier
and
less
efficient
means
of
eliciting
information
than
is
a
running
fire
of
questions
addressed
to
ministers
who
are
always
in
their
places
in
the
house
to
reply
publicly
to
all
interrogations
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
therefore
that
the
house
of
representatives
is
much
less
intimately
acquainted
with
the
details
of
federal
treasury
airs
than
is
such
a
body
as
the
house
of
commons
with
the
particulars
of
management
in
the
treasury
which
it
oversees
by
direct
and
constant
communication
with
the
chief
treasury
officials
this
is
the
greater
drawback
in
our
system
because
as
a
further
result
of
its
complete
separation
from
the
executive
congress
has
to
originate
and
perfect
the
budget
for
itself
it
does
not
hear
the
estimates
translated
and
expounded
in
condensed
statements
by
skilled
officials
who
have
made
it
their
business
because
it
is
to
their
interest
to
know
thoroughly
what
they
are
talking
about
nor
does
it
have
the
benefit
of
the
guidance
of
a
trained
practical
financier
when
it
has
to
determine
questions
of
revenue
the
treasury
is
not
consulted
with
reference
to
problems
of
taxation
and
motions
of
supply
are
disposed
of
with
no
suggestions
from
the
departments
beyond
an
itemized
statement
of
the
amounts
needed
to
meet
the
regular
expenses
of
an
opening
fiscal
year
in
federal
the
fiscal
year
closes
on
the
thirtieth
of
june
several
months
before
that
year
expires
however
the
estimates
for
the
twelve
months
which
are
to
succeed
are
made
ready
for
the
use
of
congress
in
the
autumn
each
department
and
bureau
of
the
public
service
reckons
its
pecuniary
needs
for
the
fiscal
year
which
is
to
begin
on
the
following
first
of
july
making
explanatory
notes
and
here
and
there
an
interjected
prayer
for
some
unwonted
expenditure
amongst
the
columns
of
figures
and
sends
the
resulting
document
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
these
reports
including
of
course
the
estimates
of
the
various
bureaux
of
his
own
department
the
secretary
has
printed
in
a
thin
quarto
volume
of
some
three
hundred
and
pages
which
for
some
reason
or
other
not
quite
apparent
is
called
a
letter
from
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
transmitting
estimates
of
appropriations
required
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
and
which
boasts
a
very
distinct
arrangement
under
the
heads
civil
establishment
military
establishment
naval
establishment
indian
affairs
pensions
public
works
postal
service
a
convenient
summary
of
the
chief
items
and
a
complete
index
in
december
this
letter
is
sent
as
a
part
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
annual
report
to
congress
to
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
representatives
immediately
after
the
convening
of
that
body
and
is
referred
to
the
standing
committee
on
appropriations
the
house
itself
does
not
hear
the
estimates
read
it
simply
passes
the
thin
quartos
over
to
the
committee
though
of
course
copies
of
it
may
be
procured
and
studied
by
any
member
who
chooses
to
scrutinize
the
staring
pages
of
columned
figures
with
the
dutiful
purpose
of
keeping
an
eye
upon
the
uses
made
of
the
public
revenue
taking
these
estimates
into
consideration
the
committee
on
appropriations
found
upon
them
the
general
appropriation
bills
which
the
rules
require
them
to
report
to
the
house
within
thirty
days
after
their
appointment
at
every
session
of
congress
commencing
on
the
first
monday
in
december
unless
they
can
give
satisfactory
reasons
in
writing
for
not
doing
so
the
general
appropriation
bills
provide
separately
for
legislative
executive
and
judicial
expenses
for
sundry
civil
expenses
for
consular
and
diplomatic
expenses
for
the
army
for
the
navy
for
the
expenses
of
the
indian
department
for
the
payment
of
invalid
and
other
pensions
for
the
support
of
the
military
academy
for
fortifications
for
the
service
of
the
department
and
for
mail
transportation
by
ocean
steamers
it
was
only
through
the
efforts
of
a
spirit
of
vigilant
economy
that
this
practice
of
making
the
appropriations
for
each
of
the
several
branches
of
the
public
service
in
a
separate
bill
was
established
during
the
early
years
of
the
constitution
very
loose
methods
of
appropriation
prevailed
all
the
moneys
for
the
year
were
granted
in
a
single
bill
entitled
an
act
making
appropriations
for
the
support
of
the
government
and
there
was
no
attempt
to
specify
the
objects
for
which
they
were
to
be
spent
the
gross
sum
given
could
be
applied
at
the
discretion
of
the
heads
of
the
executive
departments
and
was
always
large
enough
to
allow
much
freedom
in
the
undertaking
of
new
schemes
of
administration
and
in
the
making
of
such
additions
to
the
clerical
force
of
the
different
offices
as
might
seem
convenient
to
those
in
control
it
was
not
until
that
the
present
practice
of
somewhat
minutely
specifying
the
uses
to
be
made
of
the
funds
appropriated
was
reached
though
congress
had
for
many
years
been
by
slow
stages
approaching
such
a
policy
the
history
of
appropriations
shows
that
there
has
been
an
increasing
tendency
to
limit
the
discretion
of
the
executive
departments
and
bring
the
details
of
expenditure
more
immediately
under
the
annual
supervision
of
congress
a
tendency
which
has
specially
manifested
itself
since
the
close
of
the
recent
war
between
the
states
in
this
as
in
other
things
the
appetite
for
government
on
the
part
of
congress
has
grown
with
that
perfection
of
organization
which
has
rendered
the
gratification
of
its
desire
for
power
easily
attainable
in
this
matter
of
appropriations
however
increased
care
has
unquestionably
resulted
in
a
very
decided
curtailment
of
extravagance
in
departmental
expenditure
though
congress
has
often
shown
a
blind
ardor
for
retrenchment
which
has
fallen
little
short
of
parsimony
and
which
could
not
have
found
place
in
its
legislation
had
it
had
such
adequate
means
of
confidential
communication
with
the
executive
departments
as
would
have
enabled
it
to
understand
their
real
needs
and
to
discriminate
between
true
economy
and
those
scant
allowances
which
only
give
birth
to
deficiencies
and
which
even
under
the
luckiest
conditions
serve
only
for
a
very
brief
season
to
create
the
impression
which
they
are
usually
meant
to
beget
that
the
party
in
power
is
the
party
of
thrift
and
honesty
seeing
in
former
appropriations
too
much
that
was
corrupt
and
spendthrift
and
desiring
to
turn
to
the
good
ways
of
wisdom
and
frugality
there
are
some
portions
of
the
public
expenditure
which
do
not
depend
upon
the
annual
gifts
of
congress
but
which
are
provided
for
by
statutes
which
run
without
limit
of
date
these
are
what
are
known
as
the
permanent
appropriations
they
cover
on
the
one
hand
such
indeterminate
charges
as
the
interest
on
the
public
debt
the
amounts
annually
paid
into
the
sinking
fund
the
outlays
of
refunding
the
interest
on
the
bonds
issued
to
the
pacific
railways
and
on
the
other
hand
such
specific
charges
as
the
maintenance
of
the
militia
service
the
costs
of
the
collection
of
the
customs
revenue
and
the
interest
on
the
bequest
to
the
smithsonian
institution
their
aggregate
sum
constitutes
no
insignificant
part
of
the
entire
public
expense
in
in
a
total
appropriation
of
about
the
permanent
appropriations
fell
short
of
the
annual
grant
by
only
about
sixteen
and
a
half
millions
in
later
years
however
the
proportion
has
been
smaller
one
of
the
principal
items
the
interest
on
the
public
debt
becoming
of
course
continually
less
as
the
debt
is
paid
off
and
other
items
reaching
less
amounts
at
the
same
time
that
the
figures
of
the
annual
grants
have
risen
rather
than
fallen
with
these
permanent
grants
the
committee
on
appropriations
has
of
course
nothing
to
do
except
that
estimates
of
the
moneys
to
be
drawn
under
authority
of
such
grants
are
submitted
to
its
examination
in
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
letter
along
with
the
estimates
for
which
special
appropriations
are
asked
upon
these
latter
estimates
the
general
appropriations
are
based
the
committee
may
report
its
bills
at
any
stage
of
the
house
business
provided
only
that
it
does
not
interrupt
a
member
who
is
speaking
and
these
bills
when
reported
may
at
any
time
by
a
majority
vote
be
made
a
special
order
of
the
day
of
course
their
consideration
is
the
most
imperative
business
of
the
session
they
must
be
passed
before
the
end
of
june
else
the
departments
will
be
left
altogether
without
means
of
support
the
chairman
of
the
committee
on
appropriations
is
consequently
a
very
masterful
authority
in
the
house
he
can
force
it
to
a
consideration
of
the
business
of
his
committee
at
almost
any
time
and
by
withholding
his
reports
until
the
session
is
well
advanced
can
crowd
all
other
topics
from
the
docket
for
much
time
is
spent
over
each
of
the
general
appropriation
bills
the
spending
of
money
is
one
of
the
two
things
that
congress
invariably
stops
to
talk
about
the
other
being
the
raising
of
money
the
talk
is
made
always
in
committee
of
the
whole
into
which
the
house
at
once
resolves
itself
whenever
appropriations
are
to
be
considered
while
members
of
this
which
may
be
called
the
committee
of
supply
representatives
have
the
freest
opportunity
of
the
session
for
activity
for
usefulness
or
for
meddling
outside
the
sphere
of
their
own
committee
work
it
is
true
that
the
rule
gives
each
speaker
in
committee
of
the
whole
scant
time
for
the
expression
of
his
views
and
that
the
house
can
refuse
to
accord
full
freedom
of
debate
to
its
other
self
the
committee
of
the
whole
by
limiting
the
time
which
it
is
to
devote
to
the
discussion
of
matters
referred
to
it
or
by
providing
for
its
discharge
from
the
further
consideration
of
any
bill
committed
to
it
after
it
shall
have
acted
without
debate
on
all
amendments
pending
or
that
may
be
offered
but
as
a
rule
every
member
has
a
chance
to
offer
what
suggestions
he
pleases
upon
questions
of
appropriation
and
many
hours
are
spent
in
debate
and
amendment
of
such
bills
clause
by
clause
and
item
by
item
the
house
learns
pretty
thoroughly
what
is
in
each
of
its
appropriation
bills
before
it
sends
it
to
the
senate
but
unfortunately
the
dealings
of
the
senate
with
money
bills
generally
render
worthless
the
painstaking
action
of
the
house
the
senate
has
been
established
by
precedent
in
the
very
freest
possible
privileges
of
amendment
as
regards
these
bills
no
less
than
as
regards
all
others
the
constitution
is
silent
as
to
the
origination
of
bills
appropriating
money
it
says
simply
that
all
bills
for
shall
originate
in
the
house
of
representatives
and
that
in
considering
these
the
senate
may
propose
or
concur
with
amendments
as
on
other
bills
art
sec
vii
but
by
a
practice
as
old
as
the
government
itself
the
constitutional
prerogative
of
the
house
has
been
held
to
apply
to
all
the
general
appropriation
bills
and
the
senate
right
to
amend
these
has
been
allowed
the
widest
conceivable
scope
the
upper
house
may
add
to
them
what
it
pleases
may
go
altogether
outside
of
their
original
provisions
and
tack
to
them
entirely
new
features
of
legislation
altering
not
only
the
amounts
but
even
the
objects
of
expenditure
and
making
out
of
the
materials
sent
them
by
the
popular
chamber
measures
of
an
almost
totally
new
character
as
passed
by
the
house
of
representatives
appropriation
bills
generally
provide
for
an
expenditure
considerably
less
than
that
called
for
by
the
estimates
as
returned
from
the
senate
they
usually
propose
grants
of
many
additional
millions
having
been
brought
by
that
less
sensitive
body
up
almost
if
not
quite
to
the
figures
of
the
estimates
after
passing
their
ordeal
of
scrutiny
and
amendment
in
the
senate
the
appropriation
bills
return
with
their
new
figures
to
the
house
but
when
they
return
it
is
too
late
for
the
house
to
put
them
again
into
the
crucible
of
committee
of
the
whole
the
session
it
may
be
taken
for
granted
was
well
on
towards
its
middle
age
before
they
were
originally
introduced
by
the
house
committee
on
appropriations
after
they
reached
the
senate
they
were
referred
to
its
corresponding
committee
and
the
report
of
that
committee
upon
them
was
debated
at
the
leisurely
length
characteristic
of
the
weightier
proceedings
of
the
upper
chamber
so
that
the
last
days
of
the
session
are
fast
approaching
when
they
are
sent
down
to
the
house
with
the
work
of
the
senate
hand
upon
them
the
house
is
naturally
disinclined
to
consent
to
the
radical
alterations
wrought
by
the
senate
but
there
is
no
time
to
quarrel
with
its
colleague
unless
it
can
make
up
its
mind
to
sit
through
the
heat
of
midsummer
or
to
throw
out
the
bill
and
accept
the
discomforts
of
an
extra
session
if
the
session
be
the
short
one
which
ends
by
constitutional
requirement
on
the
of
march
the
alternative
is
the
still
more
distasteful
one
of
leaving
the
appropriations
to
be
made
by
the
next
house
the
usual
practice
therefore
is
to
adjust
such
differences
by
means
of
a
conference
between
the
two
houses
the
house
rejects
the
amendments
without
hearing
them
read
the
senate
stoutly
refuses
to
yield
a
conference
ensues
conducted
by
a
committee
of
three
members
from
each
chamber
and
a
compromise
is
effected
by
such
a
compounding
of
disagreeing
propositions
as
gives
neither
party
to
the
quarrel
the
victory
and
commonly
leaves
the
grants
not
a
little
below
the
amounts
asked
for
by
the
departments
as
a
rule
the
conference
committee
consists
on
the
part
of
the
house
of
the
chairman
of
its
committee
on
appropriations
some
other
member
of
that
committee
and
a
representative
of
the
minority
its
reports
are
matters
of
highest
prerogative
they
may
be
brought
in
even
while
a
member
is
speaking
it
is
much
better
to
silence
a
speaker
than
to
delay
for
a
single
moment
at
this
stage
of
the
session
the
pressing
imperious
question
of
the
supplies
for
the
support
of
the
government
the
report
is
therefore
acted
upon
immediately
and
in
a
mass
and
is
generally
adopted
without
debate
so
great
is
the
haste
that
the
report
is
passed
upon
before
being
printed
and
without
giving
any
one
but
the
members
of
the
conference
committee
time
to
understand
what
it
really
contains
there
is
no
chance
of
remark
or
amendment
it
receives
at
once
sanction
or
rejection
as
a
whole
and
the
chances
are
of
course
in
favor
of
its
being
accepted
because
to
reject
it
would
but
force
a
new
conference
and
bring
fresh
delays
it
is
evident
therefore
that
after
all
the
careful
and
debate
and
amendment
of
committee
of
the
whole
in
the
house
and
all
the
grave
deliberation
of
the
senate
to
which
the
general
appropriations
are
subjected
they
finally
pass
in
a
very
chaotic
state
full
of
provisions
which
neither
the
house
nor
the
senate
likes
and
utterly
vague
and
unintelligible
to
every
one
save
the
members
of
the
conference
committee
so
that
it
would
seem
almost
as
if
the
generous
portions
of
time
conscientiously
given
to
their
consideration
in
their
earlier
stages
had
been
simply
time
thrown
away
the
result
of
the
to
which
congress
seems
to
have
become
addicted
by
long
habit
in
dealing
with
the
estimates
is
of
course
the
addition
of
another
bill
to
the
number
of
the
regular
annual
grants
as
regularly
as
the
annual
session
opens
there
is
a
deficiency
bill
to
be
considered
doubtless
deficiencies
frequently
arise
because
of
miscalculations
or
extravagance
on
the
part
of
the
departments
but
the
most
serious
deficiencies
are
those
which
result
from
the
of
the
house
committee
on
appropriations
and
the
compromise
reductions
which
are
wrung
from
the
senate
by
conference
committees
every
december
consequently
along
with
the
estimates
for
the
next
fiscal
year
or
at
a
later
period
of
the
session
in
special
communications
come
estimates
of
deficiencies
in
the
appropriations
for
the
current
year
and
the
apparent
economies
of
the
grants
of
the
preceding
session
have
to
be
offset
in
the
gifts
of
the
inevitable
deficiency
bill
it
is
as
if
congress
had
designedly
established
the
plan
of
making
appropriations
at
each
session
it
grants
part
of
the
money
to
be
spent
after
the
first
of
july
following
and
such
sums
as
are
needed
to
supplement
the
expenditures
previously
authorized
to
be
made
after
the
first
of
july
preceding
it
doles
out
their
allowances
in
installments
to
its
wards
the
departments
it
is
usual
for
the
appropriations
committees
of
both
houses
when
preparing
the
annual
bills
to
take
the
testimony
of
the
directing
officers
of
the
departments
as
to
the
actual
needs
of
the
public
service
in
regard
to
all
the
principal
items
of
expenditure
having
no
place
upon
the
floor
of
the
house
and
being
in
consequence
shut
out
from
making
complete
public
statements
concerning
the
estimates
the
heads
of
the
several
executive
departments
are
forced
to
confine
themselves
to
private
communications
with
the
house
and
senate
committees
appearing
before
those
committees
in
person
or
addressing
them
more
formally
in
writing
they
explain
and
urge
the
appropriations
asked
in
the
letter
containing
the
estimates
their
written
communications
though
addressed
only
to
the
chairman
of
one
of
the
committees
frequently
reach
congress
itself
being
read
in
open
session
by
some
member
of
the
committee
in
order
to
justify
or
interpret
the
items
of
appropriation
proposed
in
a
pending
bill
not
infrequently
the
head
of
a
department
exerts
himself
to
secure
desired
supplies
by
dint
of
negotiation
with
individual
members
of
the
committee
and
by
repeated
and
insistent
private
appeals
to
their
chairman
only
a
very
small
part
of
the
relations
between
the
committees
and
the
departments
is
a
matter
of
rule
each
time
that
the
estimates
come
under
consideration
the
committees
must
specially
seek
or
the
departments
newly
volunteer
information
and
advice
it
would
seem
however
that
it
is
now
less
usual
for
the
committees
to
ask
than
for
the
secretaries
to
offer
counsel
and
suggestion
in
the
early
years
of
the
government
it
was
apparently
not
uncommon
for
the
chairman
of
spending
committees
to
seek
out
departmental
officials
in
order
to
get
necessary
enlightenment
concerning
the
mysteries
of
the
estimates
though
it
was
often
easier
to
ask
for
than
to
get
the
information
wanted
an
amusing
example
of
the
difficulties
which
then
beset
a
in
search
of
such
knowledge
is
to
be
found
in
the
private
correspondence
of
john
randolph
of
roanoke
until
the
house
committee
of
ways
and
means
which
is
one
of
the
oldest
of
the
standing
committees
had
charge
of
the
appropriations
it
was
therefore
randolph
duty
as
chairman
of
that
committee
in
to
look
into
the
estimates
and
he
thus
recounts
in
an
interesting
and
exceedingly
characteristic
letter
to
his
intimate
friend
and
correspondent
nicholson
this
pitiful
experience
which
he
had
had
in
performing
that
duty
i
called
some
time
since
at
the
navy
office
to
ask
an
explanation
of
certain
items
of
the
estimate
for
this
year
the
secretary
called
upon
his
chief
clerk
who
knew
very
little
more
of
the
business
than
his
master
i
propounded
a
question
to
the
head
of
the
department
he
turned
to
the
clerk
like
a
boy
who
can
not
say
his
lesson
and
with
imploring
countenance
beseeches
aid
the
clerk
with
much
assurance
gabbled
out
some
commonplace
jargon
which
i
could
not
take
for
sterling
an
explanation
was
required
and
both
were
dumb
this
pantomime
was
repeated
at
every
item
until
disgusted
and
ashamed
for
the
degraded
situation
of
the
principal
i
took
leave
without
pursuing
the
subject
seeing
that
my
object
could
not
be
attained
there
was
not
one
single
question
relating
to
the
department
that
the
secretary
could
answer
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
secretaries
of
are
somewhat
better
versed
in
the
affairs
of
their
departments
than
was
respectable
robert
smith
or
at
any
rate
that
they
have
chief
clerks
who
can
furnish
inquiring
chairmen
with
something
better
than
commonplace
jargon
which
no
shrewd
man
can
take
for
sterling
information
and
it
is
altogether
probable
that
such
a
scene
as
the
one
just
described
would
nowadays
be
quite
impossible
the
of
later
years
has
been
very
much
stricter
and
more
thorough
than
it
was
in
the
infancy
of
the
departments
the
estimates
are
much
more
thoroughly
differentiated
and
itemized
and
a
minute
division
of
labor
in
each
department
amongst
a
numerous
clerical
force
makes
it
comparatively
easy
for
the
chief
executive
officers
to
acquaint
themselves
quickly
and
accurately
with
the
details
of
administration
they
do
not
wait
therefore
as
a
general
thing
to
be
sought
out
and
questioned
by
the
committees
but
bestir
themselves
to
get
at
the
ears
of
the
and
especially
to
secure
if
possible
the
influence
of
the
chairmen
in
the
interest
of
adequate
appropriations
these
irregular
and
generally
informal
communications
between
the
appropriations
committees
and
the
heads
of
the
departments
taking
the
form
sometimes
of
pleas
privately
addressed
by
the
secretaries
to
individual
members
of
the
committees
and
again
of
careful
letters
which
find
their
way
into
the
reports
laid
before
congress
stand
in
our
system
in
the
place
of
the
annual
financial
statements
which
are
in
british
practice
made
by
the
ministers
to
parliament
under
circumstances
which
constitute
very
full
and
satisfactory
public
explanations
and
the
freest
replies
to
all
pertinent
questions
invariable
features
of
the
supervision
of
the
finances
by
the
commons
our
ministers
make
their
statements
to
both
houses
indirectly
and
piecemeal
through
the
medium
of
the
committees
they
are
mere
witnesses
and
are
in
no
definite
way
responsible
for
the
annual
appropriations
their
secure
tenure
of
office
is
not
at
all
affected
by
the
treatment
the
estimates
receive
at
the
hands
of
congress
to
see
our
cabinet
officers
resign
because
appropriations
had
been
refused
for
the
full
amount
asked
for
in
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
letter
would
be
as
novel
in
our
eyes
as
would
be
in
the
view
of
our
english
cousins
the
sight
of
a
ministry
of
the
crown
remaining
in
office
under
similar
circumstances
indeed
were
our
cabinets
to
stake
their
positions
upon
the
fortunes
of
the
estimates
submitted
to
congress
we
should
probably
suffer
the
tiresome
inconvenience
of
yearly
resignations
for
even
when
the
heads
of
the
departments
tax
all
their
energies
and
bring
into
requisition
all
their
arts
of
persuasion
to
secure
ample
grants
from
the
committees
the
house
committee
cuts
down
the
sums
as
usual
the
senate
committee
adds
to
them
as
before
and
the
conference
committee
strikes
a
deficient
compromise
balance
according
to
custom
there
is
in
the
house
another
appropriations
committee
besides
the
committee
on
appropriations
this
is
the
committee
on
rivers
and
harbors
created
in
december
by
the
congress
as
a
sharer
in
the
too
great
prerogatives
till
then
enjoyed
by
the
committee
on
commerce
the
committee
on
rivers
and
harbors
represents
of
course
the
permanency
of
the
policy
of
internal
improvements
until
that
policy
had
had
a
very
precarious
existence
strenuously
denied
all
tolerance
by
the
severely
constitutional
presidents
of
the
earlier
days
it
could
not
venture
to
declare
itself
openly
in
separate
appropriations
which
offered
an
easy
prey
to
the
watchful
veto
but
skulked
in
the
unobtrusive
guise
of
items
of
the
general
grants
safe
under
the
cover
of
respectable
neighbor
items
the
veto
has
never
been
allowed
to
seek
out
single
features
in
the
acts
submitted
to
the
executive
eye
and
even
such
men
as
madison
and
monroe
stiff
and
peremptory
as
they
were
in
the
assertion
of
their
conscientious
opinions
and
in
the
performance
of
what
they
conceived
to
be
their
constitutional
duty
and
much
as
they
disapproved
of
stretching
the
constitution
to
such
uses
as
national
aid
to
local
and
inland
improvements
were
fain
to
let
an
occasional
gift
of
money
for
such
purposes
pass
unforbidden
rather
than
throw
out
the
general
appropriation
bill
to
which
it
was
tacked
still
congress
did
not
make
very
frequent
or
very
flagrant
use
of
this
trick
and
schemes
of
internal
improvement
came
altogether
to
a
when
faced
by
president
jackson
imperious
disfavor
it
was
for
many
years
the
settled
practice
of
congress
to
grant
the
states
upon
the
leave
to
lay
duties
at
their
ports
for
the
improvement
of
the
harbors
and
itself
to
undertake
the
expense
of
no
public
works
save
those
upon
territory
actually
owned
by
the
united
states
but
in
later
years
the
relaxation
of
presidential
opposition
and
the
admission
of
new
states
lying
altogether
away
from
the
sea
and
therefore
quite
unwilling
to
pay
the
tariffs
which
were
building
up
the
harbors
of
their
eastern
neighbors
without
any
recompensing
advantage
to
themselves
who
had
no
harbors
revived
the
plans
which
the
vetoes
of
former
times
had
rebuffed
and
appropriations
from
the
national
coffers
began
freely
to
be
made
for
the
opening
of
the
great
water
highways
and
the
perfecting
of
the
of
commerce
the
inland
states
were
silenced
because
satisfied
by
a
share
in
the
benefits
of
national
aid
which
being
no
longer
indirect
was
not
confined
to
the
sanctioning
of
state
tariffs
which
none
but
the
commonwealths
could
benefit
by
but
which
consumers
everywhere
had
to
pay
the
greatest
increase
in
appropriations
of
this
class
took
place
just
after
since
that
date
they
have
occupied
a
very
prominent
place
in
legislation
running
from
some
twelve
millions
in
the
session
of
up
and
down
through
various
figures
to
eighteen
millions
seven
hundred
thousand
in
the
session
of
constituting
during
that
decade
the
chief
business
of
the
committee
on
commerce
and
finally
having
a
special
standing
committee
erected
for
their
superintendence
they
have
thus
culminated
with
the
culmination
of
the
protective
tariff
and
the
american
system
of
protective
tariffs
and
internal
improvements
has
thus
at
last
attained
to
its
perfect
work
the
same
prerogatives
are
accorded
this
new
appropriations
committee
which
have
been
secured
to
the
greater
committee
which
deals
with
the
estimates
its
reports
may
be
made
at
any
time
when
a
member
is
not
speaking
and
stand
in
all
respects
upon
the
same
footing
as
the
bills
proposing
the
annual
grants
it
is
a
special
spending
committee
with
its
own
key
to
the
treasury
but
the
appropriation
committees
of
the
two
houses
though
strictly
speaking
the
only
committees
of
supply
have
their
work
increased
and
supplemented
by
the
numerous
committees
which
devote
time
and
energy
to
creating
demands
upon
the
treasury
there
is
a
pension
list
in
the
estimates
for
whose
payment
the
committee
on
appropriations
has
to
provide
every
year
but
the
committee
on
pensions
is
constantly
manufacturing
new
claims
upon
the
public
revenues
there
must
be
money
forthcoming
to
build
the
new
ships
called
for
by
the
report
of
the
committee
on
naval
affairs
and
to
meet
the
charges
for
the
army
equipment
and
reforms
recommended
by
the
committee
on
military
affairs
there
are
innumerable
fingers
in
the
budget
pie
it
is
principally
in
connection
with
appropriations
that
what
has
come
to
be
known
in
our
political
slang
as
takes
place
of
course
the
chief
scene
of
this
sport
is
the
private
room
of
the
committee
on
rivers
and
harbors
and
the
season
of
its
highest
excitement
the
hours
spent
in
the
passage
of
the
river
and
harbor
bill
is
an
exchange
of
favors
representative
is
very
anxious
to
secure
a
grant
for
the
clearing
of
a
small
in
his
district
and
representative
is
equally
solicitous
about
his
plans
for
bringing
money
into
the
hands
of
the
contractors
of
his
own
constituency
whilst
representative
comes
from
a
town
whose
modest
harbor
is
neglected
because
of
the
treacherous
bar
across
its
mouth
and
representative
has
been
blamed
for
not
bestirring
himself
more
in
the
interest
of
schemes
of
improvement
afoot
amongst
the
enterprising
citizens
of
his
native
place
so
it
is
perfectly
feasible
for
these
gentlemen
to
put
their
heads
together
and
confirm
a
mutual
understanding
that
each
will
vote
in
committee
of
the
whole
for
the
grants
desired
by
the
others
in
consideration
of
the
promise
that
they
will
cry
aye
when
his
item
comes
on
to
be
considered
it
is
not
out
of
the
question
to
gain
the
favoring
ear
of
the
reporting
committee
and
a
great
deal
of
tinkering
can
be
done
with
the
bill
after
it
has
come
into
the
hands
of
the
house
lobbying
and
go
hand
in
hand
so
much
for
estimates
and
appropriations
all
questions
of
revenue
are
in
their
first
stages
in
the
hands
of
the
house
committee
of
ways
and
means
and
in
their
last
in
charge
of
the
senate
committee
on
finance
the
name
of
the
house
committee
is
evidently
borrowed
from
the
language
of
the
british
parliament
the
english
committee
of
ways
and
means
is
however
the
commons
itself
sitting
in
committee
of
the
whole
to
consider
the
statement
and
proposals
of
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
whilst
ours
is
a
standing
committee
of
the
house
composed
of
eleven
members
and
charged
with
the
preparation
of
all
legislation
relating
to
the
raising
of
the
revenue
and
to
providing
ways
and
means
for
the
support
of
the
government
we
have
in
english
parliamentary
phrase
put
our
chancellorship
of
the
exchequer
into
commission
the
chairman
of
the
committee
figures
as
our
minister
of
finance
but
he
really
of
course
only
represents
the
commission
of
eleven
over
which
he
presides
all
reports
of
the
treasury
department
are
referred
to
this
committee
of
ways
and
means
which
also
like
the
committee
on
appropriations
from
time
to
time
holds
other
more
direct
communications
with
the
officers
of
revenue
bureaux
the
annual
reports
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
are
generally
quite
full
of
minute
information
upon
the
points
most
immediately
connected
with
the
proper
duties
of
the
committee
they
are
explicit
with
regard
to
the
collection
and
disbursement
of
the
revenues
with
regard
to
the
condition
of
the
public
debt
and
with
regard
to
the
operation
of
all
laws
governing
the
financial
policy
of
the
departments
they
are
in
one
aspect
the
great
yearly
balance
sheets
exhibiting
the
receipts
and
expenditures
of
the
government
its
liabilities
and
its
credits
and
in
another
aspect
general
views
of
the
state
of
industry
and
of
the
financial
machinery
of
the
country
summarizing
the
information
compiled
by
the
bureau
of
statistics
with
reference
to
the
condition
of
the
manufactures
and
of
domestic
trade
as
well
as
with
regard
to
the
plight
of
the
currency
and
of
the
national
banks
they
are
of
course
quite
distinct
from
the
letters
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
which
contain
the
estimates
and
go
not
to
the
committee
of
ways
and
means
but
to
the
committee
on
appropriations
though
the
duties
of
the
committee
of
ways
and
means
in
supervising
the
management
of
the
revenues
of
the
country
are
quite
closely
analogous
to
those
of
the
british
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
the
lines
of
policy
in
which
they
walk
are
very
widely
separated
from
those
which
he
feels
bound
to
follow
as
i
have
said
the
object
which
he
holds
constantly
in
view
is
to
keep
the
annual
balances
as
nearly
as
possible
at
an
equilibrium
he
plans
to
raise
only
just
enough
revenue
to
satisfy
the
grants
made
in
committee
of
supply
and
leave
a
modest
surplus
to
cover
possible
errors
in
the
estimates
and
probable
fluctuations
in
the
returns
from
taxation
our
committee
of
ways
and
means
on
the
other
hand
follow
a
very
different
policy
the
revenues
which
they
control
are
raised
for
a
double
object
they
represent
not
only
the
income
of
the
government
but
also
a
carefully
erected
commercial
policy
to
which
the
income
of
the
government
has
for
many
years
been
incidental
they
are
intended
to
foster
the
manufactures
of
the
country
as
well
as
to
defray
the
expenses
of
federal
administration
were
the
maintenance
of
the
government
and
the
support
of
the
public
credit
the
chief
objects
of
our
national
policy
of
taxation
it
would
undoubtedly
be
cast
in
a
very
different
pattern
during
a
greater
part
of
the
lifetime
of
the
present
government
the
principal
feature
of
that
policy
has
been
a
complex
system
of
duties
on
imports
troublesome
and
expensive
of
collection
but
nevertheless
yielding
together
with
the
license
taxes
of
the
internal
revenue
which
later
years
have
seen
added
to
it
immense
surpluses
which
no
extravagances
of
the
spending
committees
could
exhaust
duties
few
small
and
comparatively
inexpensive
of
collection
would
afford
abundant
revenues
for
the
efficient
conduct
of
the
government
besides
comporting
much
more
evidently
with
economy
in
financial
administration
of
course
if
vast
revenues
pour
in
over
the
barriers
of
an
exacting
and
exorbitant
tariff
amply
sufficient
revenues
would
flow
in
through
the
easy
conduits
of
moderate
and
simple
duties
the
object
of
our
financial
policy
however
has
not
been
to
equalize
receipts
and
expenditures
but
to
foster
the
industries
of
the
country
the
committee
of
ways
and
means
therefore
do
not
concern
themselves
directly
with
regulating
the
income
of
the
government
they
know
that
that
in
every
probable
event
will
be
more
than
sufficient
but
with
protecting
the
interests
of
the
manufacturers
as
affected
by
the
regulation
of
the
tariff
the
resources
of
the
government
are
made
incidental
to
the
industrial
investments
of
private
citizens
this
evidently
constitutes
a
very
capital
difference
between
the
functions
of
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
and
those
of
our
committee
of
ways
and
means
in
the
policy
of
the
former
the
support
of
the
government
is
everything
with
the
latter
the
care
of
the
industries
of
the
country
is
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
duty
in
the
eyes
of
parliament
enormous
balances
represent
ignorant
or
improper
management
on
the
part
of
the
ministers
and
a
succession
of
them
is
sure
to
cast
a
cabinet
from
office
to
the
lasting
disgrace
of
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
but
to
the
mind
of
congress
vast
surpluses
are
indicative
of
nothing
in
particular
they
indicate
of
course
abundant
returns
from
the
duties
but
the
chief
concern
is
not
whether
the
duties
are
fruitful
but
whether
they
render
the
trades
prosperous
commercial
interests
are
the
essential
consideration
excess
of
income
is
a
matter
of
comparative
indifference
the
points
of
view
characteristic
of
the
two
systems
are
thus
quite
opposite
the
committee
of
ways
and
means
subordinates
its
housekeeping
duties
to
its
much
wider
business
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
subordinates
everything
to
economical
administration
this
is
evidently
the
meaning
of
the
easy
sovereignty
in
the
practice
of
the
house
of
questions
of
supply
over
questions
of
revenue
it
is
imperative
to
grant
money
for
the
support
of
the
government
but
questions
of
revenue
revision
may
be
postponed
without
inconvenience
the
two
things
do
not
necessarily
go
hand
in
hand
as
they
do
in
the
commons
the
reports
of
the
committee
of
ways
and
means
are
matters
of
quite
as
high
privilege
as
the
reports
of
the
committee
on
appropriations
but
they
by
no
means
stand
an
equal
chance
of
gaining
the
consideration
of
the
house
and
reaching
a
passage
they
have
no
inseparable
connection
with
the
annual
grants
the
needed
supplies
will
be
forthcoming
without
any
readjustments
of
taxation
to
meet
the
anticipated
demands
because
the
taxes
are
not
laid
in
the
first
instance
with
reference
to
the
expenses
which
are
to
be
paid
out
of
their
proceeds
if
it
were
the
function
of
the
committee
of
ways
and
means
as
it
is
of
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
to
adjust
the
revenue
to
the
expenditures
their
reports
would
be
as
essential
a
part
of
the
business
of
each
session
as
are
the
reports
of
the
committee
on
appropriations
but
their
proposals
occupying
as
they
do
a
very
different
place
in
legislation
may
go
to
the
wall
just
as
the
proposals
of
the
other
committees
do
at
the
demand
of
the
chairman
of
the
great
spending
committee
the
figures
of
the
annual
grants
do
not
run
near
enough
to
the
sum
of
the
annual
receipts
to
make
them
at
all
dependent
on
bills
which
concern
the
latter
it
would
seem
that
the
supervision
exercised
by
congress
over
expenditures
is
more
thorough
than
that
which
is
exercised
by
the
commons
in
england
in
the
house
created
a
standing
committee
on
public
expenditures
whose
duty
it
should
be
to
examine
into
the
state
of
the
several
public
departments
and
particularly
into
laws
making
appropriations
of
money
and
to
report
whether
the
moneys
have
been
disbursed
conformably
with
such
laws
and
also
to
report
from
time
to
time
such
provisions
and
arrangements
as
may
be
necessary
to
add
to
the
economy
of
the
departments
and
the
accountability
of
their
officers
but
this
committee
stood
as
the
only
committee
of
audit
for
but
two
years
it
was
not
then
abolished
but
its
jurisdiction
was
divided
amongst
six
other
committees
on
expenditures
in
the
several
departments
to
which
was
added
in
a
seventh
and
in
an
eighth
there
is
thus
a
separate
committee
for
the
audit
of
the
accounts
of
each
of
the
executive
departments
beside
which
the
original
single
committee
on
public
expenditures
stands
charged
with
such
duties
as
may
have
been
left
it
in
the
general
distribution
the
duties
of
these
eight
committees
are
specified
with
great
minuteness
in
the
rules
they
are
to
examine
into
the
state
of
the
accounts
and
expenditures
respectively
submitted
to
them
and
to
inquire
and
report
particularly
whether
the
expenditures
of
the
respective
departments
are
warranted
by
law
whether
the
claims
from
time
to
time
satisfied
and
discharged
by
the
respective
departments
are
supported
by
sufficient
vouchers
establishing
their
justness
both
as
to
their
character
and
amount
whether
such
claims
have
been
discharged
out
of
funds
appropriated
therefor
and
whether
all
moneys
have
been
disbursed
in
conformity
with
appropriation
laws
and
whether
any
or
what
provisions
are
necessary
to
be
adopted
to
provide
more
perfectly
for
the
proper
application
of
the
public
moneys
and
to
secure
the
government
from
demands
unjust
in
their
character
or
extravagant
in
their
amount
besides
exercising
these
functions
of
careful
audit
they
are
moreover
required
to
report
from
time
to
time
any
plans
for
retrenchment
that
may
appear
advisable
in
the
interests
of
economy
or
any
measures
that
may
be
necessary
to
secure
greater
efficiency
or
to
insure
stricter
accountability
to
congress
in
the
management
of
the
departments
to
ferret
out
all
abuses
that
may
make
their
appearance
and
to
see
to
it
that
no
department
has
useless
offices
in
its
bureaux
or
over
or
officers
on
its
rolls
but
though
these
committees
are
so
many
and
so
completely
armed
with
powers
indications
are
not
wanting
that
more
abuses
run
at
large
in
the
departments
than
they
with
all
their
eyes
are
able
to
detect
the
senate
though
it
has
no
similar
permanent
committees
has
sometimes
discovered
dishonest
dealings
that
had
altogether
escaped
the
vigilance
of
the
eight
house
committees
and
even
these
eight
occasionally
by
a
special
effort
bring
to
light
transactions
which
would
never
have
been
unearthed
in
the
ordinary
routine
course
of
their
usual
procedure
it
was
a
select
committee
of
the
senate
which
during
the
sessions
of
the
congress
discovered
that
the
contingent
fund
of
the
treasury
department
had
been
spent
in
repairs
on
the
secretary
private
residence
for
expensive
suppers
spread
before
the
secretary
political
friends
for
lemonade
for
the
delectation
of
the
secretary
private
palate
for
bouquets
for
the
gratification
of
the
secretary
busiest
allies
for
carpets
never
delivered
ice
never
used
and
services
never
rendered
although
these
were
secrets
of
which
the
honest
faces
of
the
vouchers
submitted
with
the
accounts
gave
not
a
hint
it
is
hard
to
see
how
there
could
have
been
anything
satisfactory
or
conclusive
in
the
annual
supervision
of
the
public
accounts
during
any
but
the
latest
years
of
this
system
of
committee
audit
before
our
national
was
much
like
that
still
in
vogue
in
france
credits
once
granted
ran
on
without
period
until
they
were
exhausted
there
were
always
unexpended
balances
to
confuse
the
accounts
and
when
the
figures
of
the
original
grants
had
been
on
a
too
generous
scale
as
was
often
the
case
these
balances
accumulated
from
year
to
year
in
immense
surpluses
sometimes
of
many
millions
of
whose
use
no
account
was
given
and
which
consequently
afforded
means
for
all
sorts
of
extravagance
and
peculation
in
this
abuse
was
partially
corrected
by
a
law
which
limited
such
accumulations
to
a
period
of
two
years
and
laid
hands
on
behalf
of
the
treasury
on
the
of
unexpended
balances
which
had
by
that
time
been
amassed
in
the
several
departments
but
it
was
not
till
that
such
a
rule
of
expenditure
and
accounting
was
established
as
would
make
intelligent
audit
by
the
committees
possible
by
a
proper
circumscription
of
the
time
during
which
credits
could
be
drawn
upon
without
a
regrant
such
is
a
general
view
in
brief
and
without
technical
detail
of
the
chief
features
of
our
financial
system
of
the
dealings
of
congress
with
the
questions
of
revenue
expenditure
and
supply
the
contrast
which
this
system
offers
to
the
systems
of
which
the
british
is
the
most
advanced
type
is
obviously
a
very
striking
one
the
one
is
the
very
opposite
of
the
others
on
the
one
hand
is
a
financial
policy
regulated
by
a
compact
coöperative
ministry
under
the
direction
of
a
representative
chamber
and
on
the
other
hand
a
financial
policy
directed
by
the
representative
body
itself
with
only
clerical
aid
from
the
executive
in
our
practice
in
other
words
the
committees
are
the
ministers
and
the
titular
ministers
only
confidential
clerks
there
is
no
concurrence
not
even
a
nominal
alliance
between
the
several
sections
of
this
though
their
several
duties
are
clearly
very
nearly
akin
and
as
clearly
mutually
dependent
this
feature
of
disintegration
in
leadership
runs
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
through
all
our
legislation
but
it
is
manifestly
of
much
more
serious
consequence
in
financial
administration
than
in
the
direction
of
other
concerns
of
government
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
our
revenues
are
not
regulated
with
any
immediate
reference
to
the
expenditures
of
the
government
this
method
of
spending
according
to
the
suggestions
of
one
body
and
taxing
in
obedience
to
the
suggestions
of
another
entirely
distinct
would
very
quickly
bring
us
into
distress
it
would
unquestionably
break
down
under
any
attempt
to
treat
revenue
and
expenditure
as
mutually
adjustable
parts
of
a
single
uniform
system
they
can
be
so
treated
only
when
they
are
under
the
management
of
a
single
body
only
when
all
financial
arrangements
are
based
upon
schemes
prepared
by
a
few
men
of
trained
minds
and
accordant
principles
who
can
act
with
easy
agreement
and
with
perfect
confidence
in
each
other
when
taxation
is
regarded
only
as
a
source
of
revenue
and
the
chief
object
of
financial
management
is
the
graduation
of
outlays
by
income
the
credit
and
debit
sides
of
the
account
must
come
under
a
single
eye
to
be
properly
balanced
or
at
the
least
those
officers
who
raise
the
money
must
see
and
be
guided
by
the
books
of
those
who
spend
it
it
can
not
therefore
be
reasonably
regarded
as
matter
of
surprise
that
our
financial
policy
has
been
without
consistency
or
coherency
without
progressive
continuity
the
only
evidences
of
design
to
be
discovered
in
it
appear
in
those
few
elementary
features
which
were
impressed
upon
it
in
the
first
days
of
the
government
when
congress
depended
upon
such
men
as
hamilton
and
gallatin
for
guidance
in
putting
the
finances
into
shape
as
far
as
it
has
any
invariable
characteristics
or
any
traceable
heredity
it
is
the
handiwork
of
the
sagacious
men
who
first
presided
over
the
treasury
department
since
it
has
been
altogether
in
the
hands
of
congressional
committees
it
has
so
waywardly
shifted
from
one
rôle
to
another
and
has
with
such
erratic
facility
changed
its
principles
of
action
and
its
modes
of
speech
to
suit
the
temper
and
tastes
of
the
times
that
one
who
studies
it
hardly
becomes
acquainted
with
it
in
one
decade
before
he
finds
that
that
was
a
season
quite
apart
from
and
unlike
both
those
which
went
before
and
those
which
succeeded
at
almost
every
session
congress
has
made
some
effort
more
or
less
determined
towards
changing
the
revenue
system
in
some
essential
portion
and
that
system
has
never
escaped
radical
alteration
for
ten
years
together
had
revenue
been
graduated
by
the
comparatively
steady
standard
of
the
expenditures
it
must
have
been
kept
stable
and
calculable
but
depending
as
it
has
done
on
a
and
constantly
fluctuating
industrial
policy
it
has
been
regulated
in
accordance
with
a
scheme
which
has
passed
through
as
many
phases
as
there
have
been
vicissitudes
and
vagaries
in
the
fortunes
of
commerce
and
the
tactics
of
parties
this
is
the
more
remarkable
because
upon
all
fiscal
questions
congress
acts
with
considerable
deliberation
and
care
financial
legislation
usually
if
not
always
occupies
by
far
the
most
prominent
place
in
the
business
of
each
session
though
other
questions
are
often
disposed
of
at
odd
moments
in
haste
and
without
thought
questions
of
revenue
and
supply
are
always
given
full
measure
of
debate
the
house
of
representatives
under
authority
of
the
rule
before
referred
to
which
enables
it
as
it
were
to
project
the
previous
question
into
committee
of
the
whole
by
providing
for
the
discharge
of
that
committee
from
the
further
consideration
of
any
bill
that
is
in
its
hands
or
that
may
be
about
to
be
referred
to
it
after
all
amendments
pending
and
that
may
be
offered
shall
have
been
acted
upon
without
debate
seldom
hesitates
when
any
ordinary
business
is
to
be
considered
to
forbid
to
the
proceedings
of
committee
of
the
whole
all
freedom
of
discussion
and
consequently
almost
all
discretion
as
to
the
action
to
be
taken
but
this
muzzle
is
seldom
put
upon
the
mouth
of
the
committee
when
appropriation
or
tariff
bills
are
to
be
considered
unless
the
discussion
in
committee
wanders
off
into
fields
quite
apart
from
the
proper
matter
of
the
measure
in
hand
in
which
case
the
house
interposes
to
check
the
irrelevant
talk
appropriation
bills
have
however
as
i
have
shown
a
much
higher
privilege
than
have
bills
affecting
the
tariff
and
instances
are
not
wanting
in
which
the
chairman
of
the
committee
on
appropriations
has
managed
to
engross
the
time
of
the
house
in
the
disposal
of
measures
prepared
by
his
committee
to
the
entire
exclusion
of
any
action
whatever
on
important
bills
reported
by
the
committee
of
ways
and
means
after
the
most
careful
and
laborious
deliberation
his
prerogatives
are
never
disputed
in
such
a
contest
for
consideration
between
a
supply
and
a
revenue
bill
because
these
two
subjects
do
not
under
our
system
necessarily
go
hand
in
hand
ways
and
means
bills
may
and
should
be
acted
upon
but
supply
bills
must
be
it
should
be
remarked
in
this
connection
moreover
that
much
as
congress
talks
about
fiscal
questions
whenever
permitted
to
do
so
by
the
selfish
appropriations
committee
its
talk
is
very
little
heeded
by
the
big
world
outside
its
halls
the
noteworthy
fact
to
which
i
have
already
called
attention
that
even
the
most
thorough
debates
in
congress
fail
to
awaken
any
genuine
or
active
interest
in
the
minds
of
the
people
has
had
its
most
striking
illustrations
in
the
course
of
our
financial
legislation
for
though
the
discussions
which
have
taken
place
in
congress
upon
financial
questions
have
been
so
frequent
so
protracted
and
so
thorough
engrossing
so
large
a
part
of
the
time
of
the
house
on
their
every
recurrence
they
seem
in
almost
every
instance
to
have
made
scarcely
any
impression
at
all
upon
the
public
mind
the
coinage
act
of
by
which
silver
was
demonetized
had
been
before
the
country
many
years
ere
it
reached
adoption
having
been
time
and
again
considered
by
committees
of
congress
time
and
again
printed
and
discussed
in
one
shape
or
another
and
having
finally
gained
acceptance
apparently
by
sheer
persistence
and
importunity
the
resumption
act
of
too
had
had
a
like
career
of
repeated
considerations
by
committees
repeated
printings
and
a
full
discussion
by
congress
and
yet
when
the
bland
silver
bill
of
was
on
its
way
through
the
mills
of
legislation
some
of
the
most
prominent
newspapers
of
the
country
declared
with
confidence
that
the
resumption
act
had
been
passed
inconsiderately
and
in
haste
almost
secretly
indeed
and
several
members
of
congress
had
previously
complained
that
the
demonetization
scheme
of
had
been
pushed
surreptitiously
through
the
courses
of
its
passage
congress
having
been
tricked
into
accepting
it
doing
it
scarcely
knew
what
this
indifference
of
the
country
to
what
is
said
in
congress
pointing
as
it
obviously
does
to
the
fact
that
though
the
committees
lead
in
legislation
they
lead
without
concert
or
responsibility
and
lead
nobody
in
particular
that
is
no
compact
and
organized
party
force
which
can
be
made
accountable
for
its
policy
has
also
a
further
significance
with
regard
to
the
opportunities
and
capacities
of
the
constituencies
the
doubt
and
confusion
of
thought
which
must
necessarily
exist
in
the
minds
of
the
vast
majority
of
voters
as
to
the
best
way
of
exerting
their
will
in
influencing
the
action
of
an
assembly
whose
organization
is
so
complex
whose
acts
are
apparently
so
haphazard
and
in
which
responsibility
is
spread
so
thin
throws
constituencies
into
the
hands
of
local
politicians
who
are
more
visible
and
tangible
than
are
the
leaders
of
congress
and
generates
the
while
a
profound
distrust
of
congress
as
a
body
whose
actions
can
not
be
reckoned
beforehand
by
any
standard
of
promises
made
at
elections
or
any
programmes
announced
by
conventions
constituencies
can
watch
and
understand
a
few
banded
leaders
who
display
plain
purposes
and
act
upon
them
with
promptness
but
they
can
not
watch
or
understand
forty
odd
standing
committees
each
of
which
goes
its
own
way
in
doing
what
it
can
without
any
special
regard
to
the
pledges
of
either
of
the
parties
from
which
its
membership
is
drawn
in
short
we
lack
in
our
political
life
the
conditions
most
essential
for
the
formation
of
an
active
and
effective
public
opinion
the
characteristics
of
a
nation
capable
of
public
opinion
says
bagehot
most
sagacious
of
political
critics
is
that
parties
will
be
in
each
there
will
be
a
leader
in
each
there
will
be
some
looked
up
to
and
many
who
look
up
to
them
the
opinion
of
the
party
will
be
formed
and
suggested
by
the
few
it
will
be
criticised
and
accepted
by
the
many
and
this
is
just
the
sort
of
party
organization
which
we
have
not
our
parties
have
titular
leaders
at
the
polls
in
the
persons
of
candidates
and
nominal
creeds
in
the
resolutions
of
conventions
but
no
select
few
in
whom
to
trust
for
guidance
in
the
general
policy
of
legislation
or
to
whom
to
look
for
suggestions
of
opinion
what
man
what
group
of
men
can
speak
for
the
republican
party
or
for
the
democratic
party
when
our
most
conspicuous
and
influential
politicians
say
anything
about
future
legislation
no
one
supposes
that
they
are
speaking
for
their
party
as
those
who
have
authority
they
are
known
to
speak
only
for
themselves
and
their
small
immediate
following
of
colleagues
and
friends
the
present
relations
between
congress
and
public
opinion
remind
us
of
that
time
in
the
reign
of
george
when
the
bulk
of
the
english
people
found
itself
powerless
to
control
the
course
of
english
government
when
the
government
was
divorced
from
that
general
mass
of
national
sentiment
on
which
a
government
can
alone
safely
ground
itself
then
it
was
that
english
public
opinion
robbed
as
it
was
of
all
practical
power
and
thus
stripped
of
the
feeling
of
responsibility
which
the
consciousness
of
power
carries
with
it
became
ignorant
and
indifferent
to
the
general
progress
of
the
age
but
at
the
same
time
hostile
to
government
because
it
was
government
disloyal
to
the
crown
averse
from
parliament
for
the
first
and
last
time
parliament
was
unpopular
and
its
opponents
secure
of
popularity
congress
has
in
our
own
day
become
divorced
from
the
general
mass
of
national
sentiment
simply
because
there
is
no
means
by
which
the
movements
of
that
national
sentiment
can
readily
be
registered
in
legislation
going
about
as
it
does
to
please
all
sorts
of
committees
composed
of
all
sorts
of
men
the
dull
and
the
acute
the
able
and
the
cunning
the
honest
and
the
careless
congress
evades
judgment
by
avoiding
all
coherency
of
plan
in
its
action
the
constituencies
can
hardly
tell
whether
the
works
of
any
particular
congress
have
been
good
or
bad
at
the
opening
of
its
sessions
there
was
no
determinate
policy
to
look
forward
to
and
at
their
close
no
accomplished
plans
to
look
back
upon
during
its
brief
lifetime
both
parties
may
have
vacillated
and
gone
astray
policies
may
have
shifted
and
wandered
and
untold
mischief
together
with
some
good
may
have
been
done
but
when
all
is
reviewed
it
is
next
to
impossible
oftentimes
to
distribute
justly
the
blame
and
the
praise
a
few
stubborn
may
be
at
the
bottom
of
much
of
the
harm
that
has
been
wrought
but
they
do
not
represent
their
party
and
it
can
not
be
clear
to
the
voter
how
his
ballot
is
to
change
the
habits
of
congress
for
the
better
he
distrusts
congress
because
he
feels
that
he
can
not
control
it
the
voter
moreover
feels
that
his
want
of
confidence
in
congress
is
justified
by
what
he
hears
of
the
power
of
corrupt
lobbyists
to
turn
legislation
to
their
own
uses
he
hears
of
enormous
subsidies
begged
and
obtained
of
pensions
procured
on
commission
by
professional
pension
solicitors
of
appropriations
made
in
the
interest
of
dishonest
contractors
and
he
is
not
altogether
unwarranted
in
the
conclusion
that
these
are
evils
inherent
in
the
very
nature
of
congress
for
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
power
of
the
lobbyist
consists
in
great
part
if
not
altogether
in
the
facility
afforded
him
by
the
committee
system
he
must
in
the
natural
course
of
things
have
many
most
favorable
opportunities
for
approaching
the
great
committees
it
would
be
impracticable
to
work
up
his
schemes
in
the
broad
field
of
the
whole
house
but
in
the
membership
of
a
committee
he
finds
manageable
numbers
if
he
can
gain
the
ear
of
the
committee
or
of
any
influential
portion
of
it
he
has
practically
gained
the
ear
of
the
house
itself
if
his
plans
once
get
footing
in
a
committee
report
they
may
escape
criticism
altogether
and
it
will
in
any
case
be
very
difficult
to
dislodge
them
this
accessibility
of
the
committees
by
outsiders
gives
to
illegitimate
influences
easy
approach
at
all
points
of
legislation
but
no
committees
are
affected
by
it
so
often
or
so
unfortunately
as
are
the
committees
which
control
the
public
moneys
they
are
naturally
the
ones
whose
favor
is
oftenest
and
most
importunately
as
well
as
most
insidiously
sought
and
no
description
of
our
system
of
revenue
appropriation
and
supply
would
be
complete
without
mention
of
the
manufacturers
who
cultivate
the
favor
of
the
committee
of
ways
and
means
of
the
interested
persons
who
walk
attendance
upon
the
committee
on
rivers
and
harbors
and
of
the
and
who
court
the
committee
on
appropriations
my
last
point
of
critical
comment
upon
our
system
of
financial
administration
i
shall
borrow
from
a
perspicacious
critic
of
congressional
methods
who
recently
wrote
thus
to
one
of
the
best
of
american
journals
so
long
as
the
debit
side
of
the
national
account
is
managed
by
one
set
of
men
and
the
credit
side
by
another
set
both
sets
working
separately
and
in
secret
without
any
public
responsibility
and
without
any
intervention
on
the
part
of
the
executive
official
who
is
nominally
responsible
so
long
as
these
sets
being
composed
largely
of
new
men
every
two
years
give
no
attention
to
business
except
when
congress
is
in
session
thus
spend
in
preparing
plans
the
whole
time
which
ought
to
be
spent
in
public
discussion
of
plans
already
so
that
an
immense
budget
is
rushed
through
without
discussion
in
a
week
or
ten
days
just
so
long
the
finances
will
go
from
bad
to
worse
no
matter
by
what
name
you
call
the
party
in
power
no
other
nation
on
earth
attempts
such
a
thing
or
could
attempt
it
without
soon
coming
to
grief
our
salvation
thus
far
consisting
in
an
enormous
income
with
practically
no
drain
for
military
expenditure
unquestionably
this
strikes
a
very
vital
point
of
criticism
congress
spends
its
time
working
in
sections
at
preparing
plans
instead
of
confining
itself
to
what
is
for
a
numerous
assembly
manifestly
the
much
more
useful
and
proper
function
of
debating
and
revising
plans
prepared
beforehand
for
its
consideration
by
a
commission
of
skilled
men
old
in
political
practice
and
in
legislative
habit
whose
official
life
is
apart
from
its
own
though
dependent
upon
its
will
here
in
other
words
is
another
finger
pointing
to
mill
question
as
to
the
best
legislative
commission
our
committees
fall
short
of
being
the
best
form
of
commission
not
only
in
being
too
numerous
but
also
in
being
integral
parts
of
the
body
which
they
lead
having
no
life
apart
from
it
probably
the
best
working
commission
would
be
one
which
should
make
plans
for
government
independently
of
the
representative
body
and
in
immediate
contact
with
the
practical
affairs
of
administration
but
which
should
in
all
cases
look
to
that
body
for
the
sanctioning
of
those
plans
and
should
be
immediately
responsible
to
it
for
their
success
when
put
into
operation
iv
the
senate
this
is
a
senate
a
senate
of
equals
of
men
of
individual
honor
and
personal
character
and
of
absolute
independence
we
know
no
masters
we
acknowledge
no
dictators
this
is
a
hall
for
mutual
consultation
and
discussion
not
an
arena
for
the
exhibition
of
daniel
webster
the
senate
of
the
united
states
has
been
both
extravagantly
praised
and
unreasonably
disparaged
according
to
the
predisposition
and
temper
of
its
various
critics
in
the
eyes
of
some
it
has
a
stateliness
of
character
an
eminency
of
prerogative
and
for
the
most
part
a
wisdom
of
practice
such
as
no
other
deliberative
body
possesses
whilst
in
the
estimation
of
others
it
is
now
whatever
it
may
have
been
formerly
but
a
somewhat
select
company
of
leisurely
bosses
in
whose
companionship
the
few
men
of
character
and
high
purpose
who
gain
admission
to
its
membership
find
little
that
is
encouraging
and
nothing
that
is
congenial
now
of
course
neither
of
these
extreme
opinions
so
much
as
resembles
the
uncolored
truth
nor
can
that
truth
be
obtained
by
a
judicious
mixture
of
their
milder
ingredients
the
truth
is
in
this
case
as
in
so
many
others
something
quite
commonplace
and
practical
the
senate
is
just
what
the
mode
of
its
election
and
the
conditions
of
public
life
in
this
country
make
it
its
members
are
chosen
from
the
ranks
of
active
politicians
in
accordance
with
a
law
of
natural
selection
to
which
the
state
legislatures
are
commonly
obedient
and
it
is
probable
that
it
contains
consequently
the
best
men
that
our
system
calls
into
politics
if
these
best
men
are
not
good
it
is
because
our
system
of
government
fails
to
attract
better
men
by
its
prizes
not
because
the
country
affords
or
could
afford
no
finer
material
it
has
been
usual
to
suppose
that
the
senate
was
just
what
the
constitution
intended
it
to
be
that
because
its
place
in
the
federal
system
was
exalted
the
aims
and
character
of
its
members
would
naturally
be
found
to
be
exalted
as
well
that
because
its
term
was
long
its
foresight
would
be
long
also
or
that
because
its
election
was
not
directly
of
the
people
demagogy
would
find
no
life
possible
in
its
halls
but
the
senate
is
in
fact
of
course
nothing
more
than
a
part
though
a
considerable
part
of
the
public
service
and
if
the
general
conditions
of
that
service
be
such
as
to
starve
statesmen
and
foster
demagogues
the
senate
itself
will
be
full
of
the
latter
kind
simply
because
there
are
no
others
available
there
can
not
be
a
separate
breed
of
public
men
reared
specially
for
the
senate
it
must
be
recruited
from
the
lower
branches
of
the
representative
system
of
which
it
is
only
the
topmost
part
no
stream
can
be
purer
than
its
sources
the
senate
can
have
in
it
no
better
men
than
the
best
men
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
if
the
house
of
representatives
attract
to
itself
only
inferior
talent
the
senate
must
put
up
with
the
same
sort
i
think
it
safe
to
say
therefore
that
though
it
may
not
be
as
good
as
could
be
wished
the
senate
is
as
good
as
it
can
be
under
the
circumstances
it
contains
the
most
perfect
product
of
our
politics
whatever
that
product
may
be
in
order
to
understand
and
appreciate
the
senate
therefore
one
must
know
the
conditions
of
public
life
in
this
country
what
are
those
conditions
well
in
the
first
place
they
are
not
what
they
were
in
the
early
years
of
the
federal
government
they
are
not
what
they
were
even
twenty
years
ago
for
in
this
as
in
other
things
the
war
between
the
states
ends
one
distinct
period
and
opens
another
between
the
great
constructive
statesmen
of
the
revolutionary
days
and
the
reconstructing
politicians
of
the
sixties
there
came
into
public
place
and
legislative
influence
a
great
race
of
constitutional
lawyers
the
questions
which
faced
our
statesmen
while
the
constitution
was
were
in
the
broadest
sense
questions
of
politics
but
the
questions
which
dominated
our
public
life
after
the
federal
government
had
been
successfully
set
up
were
questions
of
legal
interpretation
such
as
only
lawyers
could
grapple
with
all
matters
of
policy
all
doubts
of
legislation
even
all
difficulties
of
diplomacy
were
measured
by
rules
of
constitutional
construction
there
was
hardly
a
single
affair
of
public
concern
which
was
not
hung
upon
some
peg
of
constitutional
dogma
in
the
of
one
or
another
of
the
contending
schools
of
constitutional
interpretation
constitutional
issues
were
ever
the
tides
questions
of
administrative
policy
seldom
more
than
the
eddies
of
politics
the
republicans
under
jefferson
drew
their
nourishment
from
constitutional
belief
no
less
than
did
the
federalists
the
whigs
and
democrats
of
a
later
day
lived
on
what
was
essentially
the
same
diet
though
it
was
served
in
slightly
different
forms
and
the
parties
of
are
themselves
fain
to
go
to
these
cooks
of
the
olden
time
whenever
they
desire
strong
meat
to
fortify
them
against
their
present
debility
the
great
questions
attending
the
admission
of
new
states
to
the
union
and
the
annexation
of
foreign
territory
as
well
as
all
the
controversies
which
came
in
the
train
of
the
contest
over
slavery
and
the
reserved
powers
of
the
states
were
of
the
constitution
constitutional
and
what
other
questions
were
then
living
save
those
which
found
root
in
the
great
charter
implied
powers
about
which
there
was
such
constant
noise
of
debate
it
will
be
remembered
that
very
few
publicists
opposed
internal
improvements
for
instance
on
the
ground
that
they
were
unwise
or
uncalled
for
no
one
who
took
a
view
of
the
matter
could
fail
to
see
that
the
opening
up
of
the
great
of
the
country
the
construction
of
roads
the
cutting
of
canals
or
any
public
work
which
might
facilitate
commerce
by
making
intercourse
between
the
various
portions
of
the
union
easy
and
rapid
was
sanctioned
by
every
consideration
of
wisdom
as
being
in
conformity
with
a
policy
at
once
national
in
its
spirit
and
universal
in
its
benefits
the
doubt
was
not
as
to
what
it
would
be
best
and
most
provident
to
do
but
as
to
what
it
would
be
lawful
to
do
and
the
chief
opponents
of
schemes
of
internal
improvement
based
their
dissent
upon
a
careful
meditation
of
the
language
of
the
constitution
without
its
plain
approval
they
would
not
move
even
if
they
had
to
stand
still
all
their
days
it
was
too
with
many
professions
of
this
spirit
that
the
tariff
was
dealt
with
it
ran
suddenly
to
the
front
as
a
militant
party
question
in
not
as
if
a
great
movement
had
been
set
afoot
which
was
to
anticipate
the
mission
of
cobden
and
bright
but
as
an
issue
between
federal
taxation
and
the
constitutional
privileges
of
the
states
the
agricultural
states
were
being
as
they
thought
very
cruelly
trodden
down
under
the
iron
heel
of
that
protectionist
policy
to
whose
enthronement
they
had
themselves
consented
and
they
fetched
their
hope
of
escape
from
the
constitution
the
federal
government
unquestionably
possessed
they
admitted
and
that
by
direct
grant
of
the
fundamental
law
the
right
to
impose
duties
on
imports
but
did
that
right
carry
with
it
the
privilege
of
laying
discriminating
duties
for
other
purposes
than
that
of
raising
legitimate
revenue
could
the
constitution
have
meant
that
south
carolina
might
be
taxed
to
maintain
the
manufactures
of
new
england
close
upon
the
heels
of
the
great
tariff
controversy
of
that
time
came
the
stupendous
contest
over
the
right
of
secession
and
the
abolition
of
slavery
and
again
in
this
contest
as
in
all
that
had
gone
before
the
party
which
was
being
hard
driven
sought
refuge
in
the
constitution
this
too
was
in
its
first
stages
at
least
a
lawyer
question
it
eventually
slipped
out
of
all
lawyerly
control
and
was
given
over
to
be
settled
by
the
stern
and
savage
processes
of
war
but
it
stayed
with
the
constitutional
lawyers
as
long
as
it
could
and
would
have
stayed
with
them
to
the
end
had
it
not
itself
been
bigger
than
the
constitution
and
mixed
with
such
interests
and
such
passions
as
were
beyond
the
control
of
legislatures
or
of
law
courts
such
samples
of
the
character
which
political
questions
have
hitherto
borne
in
this
country
are
sufficient
to
remind
all
readers
of
our
history
of
what
have
been
the
chief
features
of
our
politics
and
may
serve
without
further
elaboration
to
illustrate
the
point
i
wish
to
emphasize
it
is
manifest
how
such
a
course
of
politics
would
affect
statesmanship
and
political
leadership
while
questions
affecting
the
proper
construction
of
the
constitution
were
the
chief
and
most
imperative
questions
pressing
for
settlement
great
lawyers
were
in
demand
and
great
lawyers
were
accordingly
forthcoming
in
satisfaction
of
the
demand
in
a
land
like
ours
where
litigation
is
facilitated
by
the
establishment
of
many
open
and
impartial
courts
great
lawyers
are
a
much
more
plentiful
product
than
great
administrators
unless
there
be
also
some
extraordinary
means
for
the
encouragement
of
administrative
talents
we
have
accordingly
always
had
plenty
of
excellent
lawyers
though
we
have
often
had
to
do
without
even
tolerable
administrators
and
seem
destined
to
endure
the
inconvenience
of
hereafter
doing
without
any
constructive
statesmen
at
all
the
constitutional
issues
of
former
times
were
so
big
and
so
urgent
that
they
brought
great
advocates
into
the
field
despite
all
the
tendencies
there
were
in
our
system
towards
depriving
leadership
of
all
place
of
authority
in
the
presence
of
questions
affecting
the
very
structure
and
powers
of
the
federal
government
parties
had
to
rally
with
definite
purpose
and
espouse
a
distinct
creed
and
when
the
maintenance
or
overthrow
of
slavery
had
ceased
to
be
a
question
of
constitutional
right
and
had
become
a
matter
of
contention
between
sentiment
and
vested
rights
between
interest
and
passionate
feeling
there
was
of
course
a
hot
energy
of
contest
between
two
compact
hosts
and
a
quick
elevation
of
forceful
leaders
the
three
stages
of
national
growth
which
preceded
the
war
between
the
states
were
each
of
them
creative
of
a
distinct
class
of
political
leaders
in
the
period
of
erection
there
were
great
architects
and
in
the
period
of
constitutional
interpretation
there
were
at
a
distance
from
the
people
great
political
schoolmen
who
pondered
and
expounded
the
letter
of
the
law
and
nearer
the
people
great
constitutional
advocates
who
cast
the
doctrines
of
the
schoolmen
into
policy
and
in
the
period
of
abolitionist
agitation
there
were
great
masters
of
feeling
and
leaders
of
public
purpose
the
publicists
of
the
second
period
kept
charge
of
the
slavery
question
as
i
have
said
as
long
as
they
could
and
gave
place
with
bitter
reluctance
to
the
orators
and
champions
who
were
to
talk
the
into
a
flame
but
it
was
of
course
inevitable
that
the
new
movement
should
have
new
leaders
it
was
essentially
revolutionary
in
its
tone
and
in
its
designs
and
so
quite
out
of
the
reach
of
those
principles
of
action
which
had
governed
the
policy
of
the
older
school
of
politicians
its
aim
was
to
change
not
to
vindicate
the
constitution
its
leaders
spoke
not
words
of
counsel
but
words
of
passion
and
of
command
it
was
a
crusade
not
a
campaign
the
impetuous
movement
of
a
cause
not
the
canvass
of
a
mooted
measure
and
like
every
big
stirring
cause
it
had
its
leaders
leaders
whose
authority
rested
upon
the
affections
and
sympathies
of
the
people
rather
than
upon
any
attested
wisdom
or
success
of
statesmanship
the
war
was
the
work
mediately
of
philanthropists
and
the
reconstructions
which
followed
the
war
were
the
hasty
strokes
of
these
same
unbalanced
knights
of
the
crusade
full
of
bold
feeling
but
not
of
steady
or
judgment
the
movement
called
forth
leaders
who
from
the
very
nature
of
their
calling
were
more
picturesque
than
any
who
had
figured
on
the
national
stage
since
the
notable
play
of
the
revolution
had
gone
off
the
boards
but
it
was
no
better
cast
in
leading
parts
than
had
been
the
drama
which
immediately
preceded
it
when
the
constitution
of
a
people
is
being
consciously
moulded
by
the
rapid
formation
of
precedent
during
the
earliest
periods
of
its
existence
there
are
sure
to
be
antagonistic
beliefs
distinct
and
strong
and
active
enough
to
take
shape
in
the
creeds
of
energetic
parties
each
led
by
the
greatest
advocates
of
its
cherished
principles
the
season
of
our
constitutional
development
consequently
saw
as
fine
a
race
of
statesmen
at
the
front
of
national
affairs
as
have
ever
directed
the
civil
policy
of
the
country
and
they
in
turn
gave
place
to
men
brave
to
encounter
the
struggles
of
changed
times
and
fit
to
solve
the
doubts
of
a
new
set
of
events
since
the
war
however
we
have
come
into
a
fourth
period
of
national
life
and
are
perplexed
at
finding
ourselves
denied
a
new
order
of
statesmanship
to
suit
the
altered
conditions
of
government
the
period
of
federal
construction
is
questions
of
constitutional
interpretation
are
no
longer
regarded
as
of
pressing
urgency
the
war
has
been
fought
even
the
embers
of
its
issues
being
now
almost
extinguished
and
we
are
left
to
that
unexciting
but
none
the
less
capitally
important
business
of
peaceful
development
and
judicious
administration
to
whose
execution
every
nation
in
its
middle
age
has
to
address
itself
with
what
sagacity
energy
and
prudence
it
can
command
it
can
not
be
said
that
these
new
duties
have
as
yet
raised
up
any
men
eminently
fit
for
their
fulfillment
we
have
had
no
great
administrators
since
the
opening
of
this
newest
stage
and
there
is
as
yet
no
visible
sign
that
any
such
will
soon
arise
the
forms
of
government
in
this
country
have
always
been
unfavorable
to
the
easy
elevation
of
talent
to
a
station
of
paramount
authority
and
those
forms
in
their
present
crystallization
are
more
unfavorable
than
ever
to
the
toleration
of
the
leadership
of
the
few
whilst
the
questions
now
most
prominent
in
politics
are
not
of
such
a
nature
as
to
compel
skilled
and
trustworthy
champions
to
come
into
the
field
as
did
the
constitutional
issues
and
revolutionary
agitations
of
other
days
they
are
matters
of
a
too
quiet
sort
to
enlist
feeling
or
arouse
enthusiasm
it
is
therefore
very
unfortunate
that
only
feeling
or
enthusiasm
can
create
recognized
leadership
in
our
politics
there
is
no
office
set
apart
for
the
great
party
leader
in
our
government
the
powers
of
the
speakership
of
the
house
of
representatives
are
too
cramped
and
covert
the
privileges
of
the
chairmanships
of
the
chief
standing
committees
are
too
limited
in
scope
the
presidency
is
too
silent
and
inactive
too
little
like
a
premiership
and
too
much
like
a
superintendency
if
there
be
any
one
man
to
whom
a
whole
party
or
a
great
national
majority
looks
for
guiding
counsel
he
must
lead
without
office
as
daniel
webster
did
or
in
spite
of
his
office
as
jefferson
and
jackson
did
there
must
be
something
in
the
times
or
in
the
questions
which
are
abroad
to
thrust
great
advocates
or
great
masters
of
purpose
into
a
leadership
which
is
theirs
because
they
represent
in
the
greatest
actions
of
their
lives
some
principle
at
once
vital
and
widely
loved
or
hated
or
because
they
possess
in
their
unrivaled
power
of
eloquent
speech
the
ability
to
give
voice
to
some
such
living
theme
there
must
be
a
cause
to
be
advanced
which
is
greater
than
the
trammels
of
governmental
forms
and
which
by
authority
of
its
own
imperative
voice
constitutes
its
advocates
the
leaders
of
the
nation
though
without
giving
them
official
title
without
need
of
official
title
no
one
is
authorized
to
lead
by
reason
of
any
official
station
known
to
our
system
we
call
our
real
leaders
by
no
names
but
their
own
webster
was
always
webster
and
never
prime
minister
in
a
country
which
governs
itself
by
means
of
a
public
meeting
a
congress
or
a
parliament
a
country
whose
political
life
is
representative
the
only
real
leadership
in
governmental
affairs
must
be
legislative
leadership
ascendency
in
the
public
meeting
which
decides
everything
the
leaders
if
there
be
any
must
be
those
who
suggest
the
opinions
and
rule
the
actions
of
the
representative
body
we
have
in
this
country
therefore
no
real
leadership
because
no
man
is
allowed
to
direct
the
course
of
congress
and
there
is
no
way
of
governing
the
country
save
through
congress
which
is
supreme
the
chairman
of
a
great
committee
like
the
committee
of
ways
and
means
stands
indeed
at
the
sources
of
a
very
large
and
important
stream
of
policy
and
can
turn
that
stream
at
his
pleasure
or
mix
what
he
will
with
its
waters
but
there
are
whole
provinces
of
policy
in
which
he
can
have
no
authority
at
all
he
neither
directs
nor
can
often
influence
those
other
chairmen
who
direct
all
the
other
important
affairs
of
government
he
though
the
greatest
of
chairmen
and
as
great
it
may
be
as
any
other
one
man
in
the
whole
governmental
system
is
by
no
means
at
the
head
of
the
government
he
is
as
he
feels
every
day
only
a
big
wheel
where
there
are
many
other
wheels
some
almost
as
big
as
he
and
all
driven
like
himself
by
fires
which
he
does
not
kindle
or
tend
in
a
word
we
have
no
supreme
executive
ministry
like
the
great
ministry
of
the
crown
over
sea
in
whose
hands
is
the
general
management
of
legislation
and
we
have
consequently
no
great
prizes
of
leadership
such
as
are
calculated
to
stimulate
men
of
strong
talents
to
great
and
conspicuous
public
services
the
committee
system
is
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
the
very
opposite
of
this
it
makes
all
the
prizes
of
leadership
small
and
nowhere
gathers
power
into
a
few
hands
it
can
not
be
denied
that
this
is
in
ordinary
times
and
in
the
absence
of
stirring
themes
a
great
drawback
inasmuch
as
it
makes
legislative
service
unattractive
to
minds
of
the
highest
order
to
whom
the
offer
of
really
great
place
and
power
at
the
head
of
the
governing
assembly
the
supreme
council
of
the
nation
would
be
of
all
things
most
attractive
if
the
presidency
were
competitive
if
it
could
be
won
by
distinguished
congressional
service
who
can
doubt
that
there
would
be
a
notable
influx
of
talents
into
congress
and
a
significant
elevation
of
tone
and
betterment
of
method
in
its
proceedings
and
yet
the
presidency
is
very
far
from
being
equal
to
a
premiership
there
is
i
know
one
distinctive
feature
of
legislative
leadership
which
makes
it
seem
to
some
not
altogether
to
be
desired
though
it
scarcely
constitutes
such
an
objection
as
to
make
no
leadership
at
all
seem
preferable
it
is
the
leadership
of
orators
it
is
the
ascendency
of
those
who
have
a
genius
for
talking
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
do
not
like
it
it
seems
a
leadership
of
artful
dialecticians
the
success
of
tricks
of
phrase
the
victory
of
rushing
declamation
government
not
by
the
advice
of
counselors
but
by
the
wagging
of
ready
tongues
macaulay
pointed
out
with
his
accustomed
force
of
statement
just
the
fact
which
haunts
those
who
hold
to
such
objections
the
power
of
speaking
he
said
which
is
so
highly
prized
by
politicians
in
a
popular
government
may
exist
in
the
highest
degree
without
judgment
without
fortitude
without
skill
in
reading
the
characters
of
men
or
the
signs
of
the
times
without
any
knowledge
of
the
principles
of
legislation
or
of
political
economy
and
without
any
skill
in
diplomacy
or
in
the
administration
of
war
nay
it
may
well
happen
that
those
very
intellectual
qualities
which
give
peculiar
charm
to
the
speeches
of
a
public
man
may
be
incompatible
with
the
qualities
which
would
fit
him
to
meet
a
pressing
emergency
with
promptitude
and
firmness
it
was
thus
with
charles
townshend
it
was
thus
with
windham
it
was
a
privilege
to
listen
to
those
accomplished
and
ingenious
orators
but
in
a
perilous
crisis
they
would
be
found
inferior
in
all
the
qualities
of
rulers
to
such
a
man
as
oliver
cromwell
who
talked
nonsense
or
as
william
the
silent
who
did
not
talk
at
all
nevertheless
it
is
to
be
observed
that
neither
windham
nor
townshend
rose
to
places
of
highest
confidence
in
the
assembly
which
they
served
and
which
they
charmed
by
their
attractive
powers
of
speech
and
that
cromwell
would
have
been
as
unfit
to
rule
anything
but
an
autocratic
commonwealth
as
would
have
been
william
the
silent
to
be
anything
but
a
dutch
governor
the
people
really
had
no
voice
in
cromwell
government
it
was
absolute
he
would
have
been
as
much
out
of
place
in
a
representative
government
as
a
bull
in
a
china
shop
we
would
not
have
a
bismarck
if
we
could
every
species
of
government
has
the
defects
of
its
own
qualities
representative
government
is
government
by
advocacy
by
discussion
by
persuasion
and
a
great
miscellaneous
voting
population
is
often
misled
by
deceitful
pleas
and
swayed
by
unwise
counsels
but
if
one
were
to
make
a
somewhat
freer
choice
of
examples
than
macaulay
permitted
himself
it
would
be
easy
to
multiply
the
instances
of
ruling
orators
of
our
race
who
have
added
to
their
gifts
of
eloquence
conspicuous
sagacity
in
the
administration
of
affairs
at
any
rate
the
men
who
have
led
popular
assemblies
have
often
been
like
hampden
rarely
endowed
with
judgment
foresight
and
steadfastness
of
purpose
like
walpole
amazingly
quick
in
reading
the
characters
of
men
and
the
signs
of
the
times
like
chatham
masterful
in
ordering
the
conquests
and
the
policies
of
the
world
like
burke
learned
in
the
profoundest
principles
of
statecraft
like
canning
adroit
in
diplomacy
like
pitt
safe
in
times
of
revolution
like
peel
sagacious
in
finance
or
like
gladstone
skilled
in
every
branch
of
political
knowledge
and
equal
to
any
strain
of
emergency
it
is
natural
that
orators
should
be
the
leaders
of
a
people
men
may
be
clever
and
engaging
speakers
such
as
are
to
be
found
doubtless
at
half
the
bars
of
the
country
without
being
equipped
even
tolerably
for
any
of
the
high
duties
of
the
statesman
but
men
can
scarcely
be
orators
without
that
force
of
character
that
readiness
of
resource
that
clearness
of
vision
that
grasp
of
intellect
that
courage
of
conviction
that
earnestness
of
purpose
and
that
instinct
and
capacity
for
leadership
which
are
the
eight
horses
that
draw
the
triumphal
chariot
of
every
leader
and
ruler
of
free
men
we
could
not
object
to
being
ruled
again
by
such
men
as
henry
and
otis
and
samuel
adams
but
they
were
products
of
revolution
they
were
inspired
by
the
great
causes
of
the
time
and
the
government
which
they
set
up
has
left
us
without
any
ordinary
peaceful
means
of
bringing
men
like
them
into
public
life
we
should
like
to
have
more
like
them
but
the
violent
exercise
of
revolution
is
too
big
a
price
to
pay
for
them
some
less
pungent
diet
is
to
be
desired
for
the
purpose
of
giving
health
to
our
legislative
service
there
ought
to
be
some
quiet
effective
tonic
some
mild
stimulant
such
as
the
certain
prospect
of
winning
highest
and
most
honorable
office
to
infuse
the
best
talent
of
the
nation
into
our
public
life
these
then
are
the
conditions
of
public
life
which
make
the
house
of
representatives
what
it
is
a
disintegrate
mass
of
jarring
elements
and
the
senate
what
it
is
a
small
select
and
leisurely
house
of
representatives
or
perhaps
it
would
be
nearer
the
whole
truth
to
say
that
these
are
the
circumstances
and
this
the
frame
of
government
of
which
the
two
houses
form
a
part
were
the
senate
not
supplied
principally
by
promotions
from
the
house
if
it
had
that
is
a
membership
made
up
of
men
specially
trained
for
its
peculiar
duties
it
would
probably
be
much
more
effective
than
it
is
in
fulfilling
the
great
function
of
instructive
and
debate
of
public
questions
for
its
duties
are
enough
unlike
those
of
the
house
to
be
called
peculiar
men
who
have
acquired
all
their
habits
in
the
matter
of
dealing
with
legislative
measures
in
the
house
of
representatives
where
committee
work
is
everything
and
public
discussion
nothing
but
talking
to
the
country
find
themselves
still
mere
declaimers
when
they
get
into
the
senate
where
no
previous
question
utters
its
interrupting
voice
from
the
tongues
of
tyrannical
and
where
consequently
talk
is
free
to
all
only
superior
talents
such
as
very
few
men
possess
could
enable
a
representative
of
long
training
to
change
his
spots
upon
entering
the
senate
most
men
will
not
fit
more
than
one
sphere
in
life
and
after
they
have
been
stretched
or
compressed
to
the
measure
of
that
one
they
will
rattle
about
loosely
or
stick
too
tight
in
any
other
into
which
they
may
be
thrust
still
more
or
less
adjustment
takes
place
in
every
case
if
a
new
senator
knock
about
too
loosely
amidst
the
free
spaces
of
the
rules
of
that
august
body
he
will
assuredly
have
some
of
his
biggest
corners
knocked
off
and
his
angularities
thus
made
smoother
if
he
stick
fast
amongst
the
dignified
courtesies
and
punctilious
observances
of
the
upper
chamber
he
will
if
he
stick
long
enough
finally
wear
down
to
such
a
size
by
jostling
as
to
attain
some
motion
more
or
less
satisfactory
but
it
must
be
said
on
the
other
hand
that
even
if
the
senate
were
made
up
of
something
better
than
selections
from
the
house
it
would
probably
be
able
to
do
little
more
than
it
does
in
the
way
of
giving
efficiency
to
our
system
of
legislation
for
it
has
those
same
radical
defects
of
organization
which
weaken
the
house
its
functions
also
like
those
of
the
house
are
segregated
in
the
prerogatives
of
numerous
standing
committees
in
this
regard
congress
is
all
of
a
piece
there
is
in
the
senate
no
more
opportunity
than
exists
in
the
house
for
gaining
such
recognized
party
leadership
as
would
be
likely
to
enlarge
a
man
by
giving
him
a
sense
of
power
and
to
steady
and
sober
him
by
filling
him
with
a
grave
sense
of
responsibility
so
far
as
its
organization
controls
it
the
senate
notwithstanding
the
one
or
two
special
excellences
which
make
it
more
temperate
and
often
more
rational
than
the
house
has
no
virtue
which
marks
it
as
of
a
different
nature
its
proceedings
bear
most
of
the
characteristic
features
of
committee
rule
its
conclusions
are
suggested
now
by
one
set
its
members
now
by
another
set
and
again
by
a
third
an
arrangement
which
is
of
course
quite
effective
in
its
case
as
in
that
of
the
house
in
depriving
it
of
that
leadership
which
is
valuable
in
more
ways
than
in
imparting
distinct
purpose
to
legislative
action
because
it
concentrates
party
responsibility
attracts
the
best
talents
and
fixes
public
interest
some
senators
are
indeed
seen
to
be
of
larger
mental
stature
and
built
of
stauncher
moral
stuff
than
their
and
it
is
not
uncommon
for
individual
members
to
become
conspicuous
figures
in
every
great
event
in
the
senate
deliberations
the
public
now
and
again
picks
out
here
and
there
a
senator
who
seems
to
act
and
to
speak
with
true
instinct
of
statesmanship
and
who
unmistakably
merits
the
confidence
of
colleagues
and
of
people
but
such
a
man
however
eminent
is
never
more
than
senator
no
one
is
senator
no
one
may
speak
for
his
party
as
well
as
for
himself
no
one
exercises
the
special
trust
of
acknowledged
leadership
the
senate
is
merely
a
body
of
individual
critics
representing
most
of
the
not
very
diversified
types
of
a
society
substantially
homogeneous
and
the
weight
of
every
criticism
uttered
in
its
chamber
depends
upon
the
weight
of
the
critic
who
utters
it
deriving
little
if
any
addition
to
its
specific
gravity
from
connection
with
the
designs
of
a
purposeful
party
organization
i
can
not
insist
too
much
upon
this
defect
of
congressional
government
because
it
is
evidently
radical
leadership
with
authority
over
a
great
ruling
party
is
a
prize
to
attract
great
competitors
and
is
in
a
free
government
the
only
prize
that
will
attract
great
competitors
its
attractiveness
is
abundantly
illustrated
in
the
operations
of
the
british
system
in
england
where
members
of
the
cabinet
which
is
merely
a
committee
of
the
house
of
commons
are
the
rulers
of
the
empire
a
career
in
the
commons
is
eagerly
sought
by
men
of
the
rarest
gifts
because
a
career
there
is
the
best
road
is
indeed
the
only
road
to
membership
of
the
great
committee
a
part
in
the
life
of
congress
on
the
contrary
though
the
best
career
opened
to
men
of
ambition
by
our
system
has
no
prize
at
its
end
greater
than
membership
of
some
one
of
numerous
committees
between
which
there
is
some
choice
to
be
sure
because
some
of
them
have
great
and
others
only
small
jurisdictions
but
none
of
which
has
the
distinction
of
supremacy
in
policy
or
of
recognized
authority
to
do
more
than
suggest
and
posts
upon
such
committees
are
the
highest
posts
in
the
senate
just
as
they
are
in
the
house
pf
representatives
in
an
address
delivered
on
a
recent
occasion
in
the
capacity
of
president
of
the
birmingham
and
midland
institute
froude
having
in
mind
of
course
british
forms
of
government
but
looking
mediately
at
all
popular
systems
said
very
pointedly
that
in
party
government
party
life
becomes
like
a
court
of
justice
the
people
are
the
judges
the
politicians
the
advocates
who
he
adds
caustically
rather
than
justly
only
occasionally
and
by
accident
speak
their
real
opinions
the
truly
great
political
orators
he
exclaims
are
the
ornaments
of
mankind
the
most
finished
examples
of
noble
feeling
and
perfect
expression
but
they
rarely
understand
the
circumstances
of
their
time
they
feel
passionately
but
for
that
reason
they
can
not
judge
calmly
if
we
are
to
accept
these
judgments
from
froude
in
the
face
of
his
reputation
for
thinking
somewhat
too
independently
of
evidence
we
should
congratulate
ourselves
that
we
have
in
this
country
hit
upon
a
system
which
now
that
it
has
reached
its
perfection
has
left
little
or
no
place
for
politicians
to
make
false
declarations
or
for
the
orator
to
coin
fine
expression
for
views
which
are
only
feelings
except
outside
of
the
legislative
halls
of
the
nation
upon
the
platform
where
talk
is
all
that
is
expected
it
would
seem
as
if
the
seer
had
a
much
more
favorable
opportunity
in
the
than
the
orator
can
have
and
with
us
it
is
the
which
governs
the
legislative
chamber
the
in
the
latter
neither
makes
nor
often
seriously
affects
the
plans
framed
in
the
former
because
the
plans
are
made
before
the
speeches
are
uttered
this
is
of
the
debates
of
the
house
but
even
the
speeches
made
in
the
senate
free
full
and
earnest
as
they
seem
are
made
so
to
speak
after
the
fact
not
to
determine
the
actions
but
to
air
the
opinions
of
the
body
still
it
must
be
regarded
as
no
inconsiderable
addition
to
the
usefulness
of
the
senate
that
it
enjoys
a
much
greater
freedom
of
discussion
than
the
house
can
allow
itself
it
permits
itself
a
good
deal
of
talk
in
public
about
what
it
is
doing
and
it
commonly
talks
a
great
deal
of
sense
it
is
small
enough
to
make
it
safe
to
allow
individual
freedom
to
its
members
and
to
have
at
the
same
time
such
order
and
sense
of
proportion
in
its
proceedings
as
is
characteristic
of
small
bodies
like
boards
of
college
trustees
or
of
commercial
directors
who
feel
that
their
main
object
is
business
not
and
so
say
all
that
is
necessary
without
being
tedious
and
do
what
they
are
called
upon
to
do
without
need
of
driving
themselves
with
hurrying
rules
such
rules
they
seem
to
feel
are
meant
only
for
big
assemblies
which
have
no
power
of
of
course
the
senate
talks
more
than
an
average
board
of
directors
would
because
the
corporations
which
it
represents
are
states
made
up
politically
speaking
of
numerous
popular
constituencies
to
which
senators
no
less
than
representatives
must
make
speeches
of
a
sort
which
considering
their
alone
would
be
unnecessary
if
not
impertinent
and
out
of
taste
in
the
senate
chamber
but
which
will
sound
best
in
the
ears
of
the
people
for
whose
ears
they
are
intended
if
delivered
there
speeches
which
so
to
say
run
in
the
name
of
the
business
will
generally
be
more
effectual
for
campaign
uses
at
home
than
any
speech
could
be
which
should
run
in
the
name
of
the
proper
topics
of
the
stump
there
is
an
air
of
doing
one
duty
by
one
party
in
speaking
party
platitudes
or
uttering
party
defiances
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
or
of
the
house
of
course
however
there
is
less
temptation
to
such
in
the
senate
than
in
the
house
the
house
knows
the
terrible
possibilities
of
this
sort
in
store
for
it
were
it
to
give
perfect
freedom
of
debate
to
its
three
hundred
and
members
in
these
days
when
frequent
mails
and
tireless
tongues
of
telegraphy
bring
every
constituency
within
easy
earshot
of
washington
and
it
therefore
seeks
to
confine
what
little
discussion
it
indulges
in
to
the
few
specially
in
charge
of
the
business
of
each
moment
but
the
senate
is
small
and
of
settled
habits
and
has
no
such
bugbear
to
trouble
it
it
can
afford
to
do
without
any
or
previous
question
no
senator
is
likely
to
want
to
speak
on
all
the
topics
of
the
session
or
to
prepare
more
speeches
than
can
conveniently
be
spoken
before
adjournment
is
imperatively
at
hand
the
house
can
be
counted
upon
to
waste
enough
time
to
leave
some
leisure
to
the
upper
chamber
and
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
debates
which
take
place
every
session
in
the
senate
are
of
a
very
high
order
of
excellence
the
average
of
the
ability
displayed
in
its
discussions
not
infrequently
rises
quite
to
the
level
of
those
controversies
of
the
past
which
we
are
wont
to
call
great
because
they
furnished
occasion
to
men
like
webster
and
calhoun
and
clay
whom
we
can
not
now
quite
match
in
mastery
of
knowledge
and
of
eloquence
if
the
debates
of
the
present
are
smothered
amongst
the
innumerable
folios
of
the
record
it
is
not
because
they
do
not
contain
utterances
worthy
to
be
heeded
and
to
gain
currency
but
because
they
do
not
deal
with
questions
of
passion
or
of
national
existence
such
as
ran
through
all
the
earlier
debates
or
because
our
system
so
obscures
and
complicates
party
rule
in
legislation
as
to
leave
nothing
very
interesting
to
the
public
eye
dependent
upon
the
discussions
of
either
house
or
senate
what
that
is
picturesque
or
what
that
is
vital
in
the
esteem
of
the
partisan
is
there
in
these
wordy
contests
about
contemplated
legislation
how
does
anybody
know
that
either
party
prospects
will
be
much
affected
by
what
is
said
when
senators
are
debating
or
for
that
matter
by
what
is
voted
after
their
longest
flights
of
controversy
still
though
not
much
heeded
the
debates
of
the
senate
are
of
great
value
in
scrutinizing
and
sifting
matters
which
come
up
from
the
house
the
senate
opportunities
for
open
and
unrestricted
discussion
and
its
simple
comparatively
unencumbered
forms
of
procedure
unquestionably
enable
it
to
fulfill
with
very
considerable
success
its
high
functions
as
a
chamber
of
revision
when
this
has
been
claimed
and
admitted
however
it
still
remains
to
be
considered
whether
two
chambers
of
equal
power
strengthen
by
steadying
or
weaken
by
complicating
a
system
of
representative
government
like
our
own
the
utility
and
excellence
of
a
bicameral
system
has
never
i
believe
been
seriously
questioned
in
this
country
but
turgot
smiles
with
something
like
contempt
at
our
affectation
in
copying
the
house
of
lords
without
having
any
lords
to
use
for
the
purpose
and
in
our
own
day
bagehot
who
is
much
more
competent
to
speak
on
this
head
than
was
turgot
has
avowed
very
grave
doubts
as
to
the
practical
advantage
of
a
legislature
each
head
having
its
own
independent
will
he
finds
much
to
recommend
the
house
of
lords
in
the
fact
that
it
is
not
as
theory
would
have
it
coördinate
and
coequal
with
the
house
of
commons
but
merely
a
revising
and
suspending
house
altering
what
the
commons
have
done
hastily
or
carelessly
and
sometimes
rejecting
bills
on
which
the
house
of
commons
is
not
yet
thoroughly
in
earnest
upon
which
the
nation
is
not
yet
determined
he
points
out
the
fact
that
the
house
of
lords
has
never
in
modern
times
been
as
a
house
coequal
in
power
with
the
house
of
commons
before
the
reform
bill
of
the
peers
were
in
legislation
not
however
because
they
were
members
of
the
house
of
lords
but
because
they
nominated
most
of
the
members
of
the
house
of
commons
since
that
disturbing
reform
they
have
been
thrown
back
upon
the
functions
in
which
they
never
were
strong
the
functions
of
a
deliberative
assembly
these
are
the
facts
which
seem
to
bagehot
to
have
made
it
possible
for
legislation
to
make
easy
and
satisfactory
progress
under
a
system
whose
theory
provided
for
fatal
between
the
two
branches
of
the
supreme
legislature
in
his
view
the
evil
of
two
coequal
houses
of
distinct
natures
is
obvious
most
constitutions
he
declares
have
committed
this
blunder
the
two
most
remarkable
republican
institutions
in
the
world
commit
it
in
both
the
american
and
swiss
constitutions
the
upper
house
has
as
much
authority
as
the
second
it
could
produce
the
maximum
of
impediment
a
if
it
liked
if
it
does
not
do
so
it
is
owing
not
to
the
goodness
of
the
legal
constitution
but
to
the
discreetness
of
the
members
of
the
chamber
in
both
these
constitutions
this
dangerous
division
is
defended
by
a
peculiar
doctrine
it
is
said
that
there
must
be
in
a
federal
government
some
institution
some
authority
some
body
possessing
a
veto
in
which
the
separate
states
comprising
the
confederation
are
all
equal
i
confess
this
doctrine
has
to
me
no
and
it
is
assumed
but
not
proved
the
state
of
delaware
is
not
equal
in
power
or
influence
to
the
state
of
new
york
and
you
can
not
make
it
so
by
giving
it
an
equal
veto
in
an
upper
chamber
the
history
of
such
an
institution
is
indeed
most
natural
a
little
state
will
like
and
must
like
to
see
some
token
some
memorial
mark
of
its
old
independence
preserved
in
the
constitution
by
which
that
independence
is
extinguished
but
it
is
one
thing
for
an
institution
to
be
natural
and
another
for
it
to
be
expedient
if
indeed
it
be
that
a
federal
government
compels
the
erection
of
an
upper
chamber
of
conclusive
and
coördinate
authority
it
is
one
more
in
addition
to
the
many
other
inherent
defects
of
that
kind
of
government
it
may
be
necessary
to
have
the
blemish
but
it
is
a
blemish
just
as
much
it
would
be
in
the
highest
degree
indiscreet
to
differ
lightly
with
any
conclusion
to
which
bagehot
may
have
come
in
viewing
that
field
of
critical
exposition
in
which
he
was
supreme
the
philosophical
analysis
namely
of
the
english
constitution
and
it
must
be
apparent
to
any
one
who
reads
the
passage
i
have
just
now
quoted
that
his
eye
sees
very
keenly
and
truly
even
when
he
looks
across
sea
at
institutions
which
were
repugnant
to
his
own
way
of
thinking
but
it
is
safe
to
say
that
he
did
not
see
all
in
this
instance
and
that
he
was
consequently
in
error
concerning
the
true
nature
of
our
federal
legislative
system
his
error
nevertheless
appears
not
when
we
look
only
at
the
facts
which
he
held
up
to
view
but
when
we
look
at
other
facts
which
he
ignored
it
is
true
that
the
existence
of
two
coequal
houses
is
an
evil
when
those
two
houses
are
of
distinct
natures
as
was
the
case
under
the
victorian
constitution
to
which
bagehot
refers
by
way
of
illustrative
example
under
that
constitution
all
legislative
business
was
sometimes
to
be
seen
quite
suspended
because
of
irreconcilable
differences
of
opinion
between
the
upper
house
which
represented
the
rich
of
the
colony
and
the
lower
assembly
which
represented
the
lesser
perhaps
and
the
people
who
were
not
at
all
the
upper
house
in
other
words
was
a
class
chamber
and
thus
stood
quite
apart
from
anything
like
the
principle
embodied
in
our
own
senate
which
is
no
more
a
class
chamber
than
is
the
house
of
representatives
the
prerogatives
of
the
senate
do
indeed
render
our
legislative
system
more
complex
and
for
that
reason
possibly
more
cumbersome
than
the
british
for
our
senate
can
do
more
than
the
house
of
lords
it
can
not
only
question
and
stay
the
judgment
of
the
commons
but
may
always
with
perfect
safety
act
upon
its
own
judgment
and
gainsay
the
more
popular
chamber
to
the
end
of
the
longest
chapter
of
the
bitterest
controversy
it
is
quite
as
free
to
act
as
is
any
other
branch
of
the
government
and
quite
as
sure
to
have
its
acts
regarded
but
there
is
safety
and
ease
in
the
fact
that
the
senate
never
wishes
to
carry
its
resistance
to
the
house
to
that
point
at
which
resistance
must
stay
all
progress
in
legislation
because
there
is
really
a
latent
unity
between
the
senate
and
the
house
which
makes
continued
antagonism
between
them
next
to
impossible
certainly
in
the
highest
degree
improbable
the
senate
and
the
house
are
of
different
origins
but
virtually
of
the
same
nature
the
senate
is
less
democratic
than
the
house
and
consequently
less
sensible
to
transient
phases
of
public
opinion
but
it
is
no
less
sensible
than
the
house
of
its
ultimate
accountability
to
the
people
and
is
consequently
quite
as
obedient
to
the
more
permanent
and
imperative
judgments
of
the
public
mind
it
can
not
be
carried
so
quickly
by
every
new
sentiment
but
it
can
be
carried
quickly
enough
there
is
a
main
chance
of
election
time
for
it
as
well
as
for
the
house
to
think
about
by
the
mode
of
its
election
and
the
greater
length
of
the
term
by
which
its
seats
are
held
the
senate
is
almost
altogether
removed
from
that
temptation
to
servile
obedience
to
the
whims
of
popular
constituencies
to
which
the
house
is
constantly
subject
without
as
much
courage
as
the
senate
has
to
guard
its
virtue
but
the
men
who
compose
the
senate
are
of
the
same
sort
as
the
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
represent
quite
as
various
classes
nowadays
many
of
the
senators
are
indeed
very
rich
men
and
there
has
come
to
be
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
their
vast
wealth
and
the
supposed
aristocratic
tendencies
which
it
is
imagined
to
breed
but
even
the
rich
senators
can
not
be
said
to
be
representatives
of
a
class
as
if
they
were
all
opulent
or
great
their
wealth
is
in
all
sorts
of
stocks
in
all
sorts
of
machinery
in
all
sorts
of
buildings
in
possessions
of
all
the
sorts
possible
in
a
land
of
bustling
commerce
and
industries
they
have
made
their
money
in
a
hundred
different
ways
or
have
inherited
it
from
fathers
who
amassed
it
in
enterprises
too
numerous
to
imagine
and
they
have
it
invested
here
there
and
everywhere
in
this
that
and
everything
their
wealth
represents
no
class
interests
but
all
the
interests
of
the
commercial
world
it
represents
the
majority
of
the
nation
in
a
word
and
so
they
can
probably
be
trusted
not
to
neglect
one
set
of
interests
for
another
not
to
despoil
the
trader
for
the
sake
of
the
farmer
or
the
farmer
for
the
sake
of
the
or
the
for
the
behoof
of
the
herder
of
cattle
at
least
the
senate
is
quite
as
trustworthy
in
this
regard
as
is
the
house
of
representatives
inasmuch
as
the
senate
is
thus
separated
from
class
interests
and
quite
as
representative
of
the
nation
at
large
as
is
the
house
of
representatives
the
fact
that
it
is
less
quickly
sensitive
to
the
hasty
or
impulsive
movements
of
public
opinion
constitutes
its
value
as
a
check
a
steadying
weight
in
our
very
democratic
system
our
english
cousins
have
worked
out
for
themselves
a
wonderfully
perfect
scheme
of
government
by
gradually
making
their
monarchy
unmonarchical
they
have
made
of
it
a
republic
steadied
by
a
reverenced
aristocracy
and
pivoted
upon
a
stable
throne
and
just
as
the
english
system
is
a
limited
monarchy
because
of
commons
and
cabinet
ours
may
be
said
to
be
a
limited
democracy
because
of
the
senate
this
has
in
the
trial
of
the
scheme
proved
the
chief
value
of
that
upper
chamber
which
was
instituted
principally
as
an
earnest
of
the
abiding
equality
and
sovereignty
of
the
states
at
any
rate
this
is
the
most
conspicuous
and
will
prove
to
be
the
most
lasting
use
of
the
senate
in
our
system
it
is
valuable
in
our
democracy
in
proportion
as
it
is
undemocratic
i
think
that
a
philosophical
analysis
of
any
successful
and
beneficent
system
of
will
disclose
the
fact
that
its
only
effectual
checks
consist
in
a
mixture
of
elements
in
a
combination
of
seemingly
contradictory
political
principles
that
the
british
government
is
perfect
in
proportion
as
it
is
unmonarchical
and
ours
safe
in
proportion
as
it
is
undemocratic
that
the
senate
saves
us
often
from
headlong
popular
tyranny
the
value
spirit
and
essence
of
the
house
of
commons
said
burke
consists
in
its
being
the
express
image
of
the
feelings
of
the
nation
but
the
image
of
the
nation
feelings
should
not
be
the
only
thing
reflected
by
the
constitution
of
a
free
government
it
is
indispensable
that
besides
the
house
of
representatives
which
runs
on
all
fours
with
popular
sentiment
we
should
have
a
body
like
the
senate
which
may
refuse
to
run
with
it
at
all
when
it
seems
to
be
wrong
a
body
which
has
time
and
security
enough
to
keep
its
head
if
only
now
and
then
and
but
for
a
little
while
till
other
people
have
had
time
to
think
the
senate
is
fitted
to
do
deliberately
and
well
the
revising
which
is
its
properest
function
because
its
position
as
a
representative
of
state
sovereignty
is
one
of
eminent
dignity
securing
for
it
ready
and
sincere
respect
and
because
popular
demands
ere
they
reach
it
with
definite
and
authoritative
suggestion
are
diluted
by
passage
through
the
feelings
and
conclusions
of
the
state
legislatures
which
are
the
senate
only
immediate
constituents
the
senate
commonly
feels
with
the
house
but
it
does
not
so
to
say
feel
so
fast
it
at
least
has
a
chance
to
be
the
express
image
of
those
judgments
of
the
nation
which
are
slower
and
more
temperate
than
its
feelings
this
it
is
which
makes
the
senate
the
most
powerful
and
efficient
second
chamber
that
exists
and
this
it
is
which
constitutes
its
functions
one
of
the
effectual
checks
one
of
the
real
balances
of
our
system
though
it
is
made
to
seem
very
insignificant
in
the
literary
theory
of
the
constitution
where
the
checks
of
state
upon
federal
authorities
of
executive
prerogatives
upon
legislative
powers
and
of
judiciary
upon
president
and
congress
though
some
of
them
in
reality
inoperative
from
the
first
and
all
of
them
weakened
by
many
ifs
and
buts
are
made
to
figure
in
the
leading
rôles
as
the
characteristic
virtues
triumphing
over
the
characteristic
vices
of
our
new
and
original
political
it
should
however
be
accounted
a
deduction
from
the
usefulness
that
it
is
seldom
sure
of
more
than
two
thirds
of
itself
for
more
than
four
years
at
a
time
in
order
that
its
life
may
be
perpetual
one
third
of
its
membership
is
renewed
or
changed
every
two
years
each
third
taking
its
turn
at
change
or
renewal
in
regular
succession
and
this
device
has
of
course
an
appreciably
weakening
effect
on
the
legislative
sinews
of
the
senate
because
the
senate
mixes
the
parties
in
the
composition
of
its
committees
just
as
the
house
does
and
those
committees
must
consequently
be
subjected
to
modification
whenever
the
biennial
senatorial
elections
bring
in
new
men
freshly
promoted
from
the
house
or
from
gubernatorial
chairs
places
must
be
found
for
them
at
once
in
the
working
organization
which
busies
itself
in
the
six
years
is
not
the
term
of
the
senate
but
only
of
each
senator
reckoning
from
any
year
in
which
one
third
of
the
senate
is
elected
the
term
of
the
majority
the
two
thirds
not
affected
by
the
election
is
an
average
of
the
four
and
the
two
years
which
it
has
to
live
there
is
never
a
time
at
which
two
thirds
of
the
senate
have
more
than
four
years
of
appointed
service
before
them
and
this
constant
liability
to
change
must
of
course
materially
affect
the
policy
of
the
body
the
time
assured
it
in
which
to
carry
out
any
enterprise
of
policy
upon
which
it
may
embark
is
seldom
more
than
two
years
the
term
of
the
house
it
may
be
checked
no
less
effectually
than
the
lower
house
by
the
biennial
elections
albeit
the
changes
brought
about
in
its
membership
are
effected
not
directly
by
the
people
but
indirectly
and
more
slowly
by
the
mediate
operation
of
public
opinion
through
the
legislatures
of
the
states
in
estimating
the
value
of
the
senate
therefore
as
a
branch
of
the
national
legislature
we
should
offset
the
committee
organization
with
its
denial
of
leadership
which
disintegrates
the
senate
and
that
liability
to
the
biennial
infusion
of
new
elements
which
may
at
any
time
interrupt
the
policy
and
break
the
purpose
of
the
senate
against
those
habits
of
free
and
open
debate
which
clear
its
mind
and
to
some
extent
the
mind
of
the
public
with
regard
to
the
nation
business
doing
much
towards
making
legislation
definite
and
consistent
and
against
those
great
additions
to
its
efficiency
which
spring
from
its
observation
of
slow
and
steady
forms
of
procedure
from
the
mediate
election
which
gives
it
independence
and
from
its
having
a
rational
and
august
cause
for
existing
when
we
turn
to
consider
the
senate
in
its
relations
with
the
executive
we
see
it
no
longer
as
a
legislative
chamber
but
as
a
consultative
executive
council
and
just
here
there
is
to
be
noted
an
interesting
difference
between
the
relations
of
the
senate
with
the
president
and
its
relations
with
the
departments
which
are
in
constitutional
theory
one
with
the
president
it
deals
directly
with
the
president
in
acting
upon
nominations
and
upon
treaties
it
goes
into
executive
session
to
handle
without
gloves
the
acts
of
the
chief
magistrate
its
dealings
with
the
departments
on
the
other
hand
are
like
those
of
the
house
only
indirect
its
legislative
not
its
executive
function
is
the
whip
which
coerces
the
secretaries
its
will
is
the
supreme
law
in
the
offices
of
the
government
and
yet
it
orders
policy
by
no
direct
word
to
the
departments
it
does
not
consult
and
negotiate
with
them
as
it
does
with
the
president
their
titular
head
its
immediate
agents
the
committees
are
not
the
recognized
constitutional
superiors
of
secretary
or
comptroller
but
these
officials
can
not
move
a
finger
or
plan
more
than
a
paltry
detail
without
looking
to
it
that
they
render
strict
obedience
to
the
wishes
of
these
outside
uncommissioned
and
irresponsible
but
none
the
less
authoritative
and
imperative
masters
this
feature
of
the
senate
power
over
the
executive
does
not
however
call
for
special
emphasis
here
because
it
is
not
a
power
peculiar
to
the
senate
this
overlordship
of
the
departments
but
one
which
it
possesses
in
common
with
the
house
of
representatives
simply
an
innate
and
inseparable
part
of
the
absolutism
of
a
supreme
legislature
it
is
the
senate
position
as
the
president
council
in
some
great
and
many
small
matters
which
call
for
particular
discussion
its
general
tyranny
over
the
departments
belongs
rather
with
what
i
am
to
say
presently
when
looking
at
congressional
government
from
the
of
the
executive
the
greatest
consultative
privilege
of
the
senate
the
greatest
in
dignity
at
least
if
not
in
effect
upon
the
interests
of
the
country
is
its
right
to
a
ruling
voice
in
the
ratification
of
treaties
with
foreign
powers
i
have
already
alluded
to
this
privilege
for
the
purpose
of
showing
what
weight
it
has
had
in
many
instances
in
disarranging
the
ideal
balance
supposed
to
exist
between
the
powers
of
congress
and
the
constitutional
prerogatives
of
the
president
but
i
did
not
then
stop
to
discuss
the
organic
reasons
which
have
made
it
impossible
that
there
should
be
any
real
consultation
between
the
president
and
the
senate
upon
such
business
and
which
have
consequently
made
disagreement
and
even
antagonism
between
them
probable
outcomes
of
the
system
i
do
not
consult
the
auditor
who
scrutinizes
my
accounts
when
i
submit
to
him
my
books
my
vouchers
and
a
written
report
of
the
business
i
have
negotiated
i
do
not
take
his
advice
and
seek
his
consent
i
simply
ask
his
endorsement
or
invite
his
condemnation
i
do
not
sue
for
his
coöperation
but
challenge
his
criticism
and
the
analogy
between
my
relations
with
the
auditor
and
the
relations
of
the
president
with
the
senate
is
by
no
means
remote
the
president
really
has
no
voice
at
all
in
the
conclusions
of
the
senate
with
reference
to
his
diplomatic
transactions
or
with
reference
to
any
of
the
matters
upon
which
he
consults
it
and
yet
without
a
voice
in
the
conclusion
there
is
no
consultation
argument
and
an
unobstructed
interchange
of
views
upon
a
ground
of
absolute
equality
are
essential
parts
of
the
substance
of
genuine
consultation
the
senate
when
it
closes
its
doors
upon
going
into
executive
session
closes
them
upon
the
president
as
much
as
upon
the
rest
of
the
world
he
can
not
meet
their
objections
to
his
courses
except
through
the
clogged
and
inadequate
channels
of
a
written
message
or
through
the
friendly
but
unauthoritative
offices
of
some
senator
who
may
volunteer
his
active
support
nay
in
many
cases
the
president
may
not
even
know
what
the
senate
objections
were
he
is
made
to
approach
that
body
as
a
servant
conferring
with
his
master
and
of
course
deferring
to
that
master
his
only
power
of
compelling
compliance
on
the
part
of
the
senate
lies
in
his
initiative
in
negotiation
which
affords
him
a
chance
to
get
the
country
into
such
scrapes
so
pledged
in
the
view
of
the
world
to
certain
courses
of
action
that
the
senate
hesitates
to
bring
about
the
appearance
of
dishonor
which
would
follow
its
refusal
to
ratify
the
rash
promises
or
to
support
the
indiscreet
threats
of
the
department
of
state
the
machinery
of
consultation
between
the
senate
and
the
president
is
of
course
the
committee
machinery
the
senate
sends
treaties
to
its
standing
committee
on
foreign
relations
which
ponders
the
messages
accompanying
the
treaties
and
sets
itself
to
understand
the
situation
in
the
light
of
all
the
information
available
if
the
president
wishes
some
more
satisfactory
mode
of
communication
with
the
senate
than
formal
his
only
door
of
approach
is
this
committee
on
foreign
relations
the
secretary
of
state
may
confer
with
its
chairman
or
with
its
more
influential
members
but
such
a
mode
of
conference
is
manifestly
much
less
than
a
voice
in
the
deliberations
of
the
senate
itself
much
less
than
meeting
that
body
face
to
face
in
free
consultation
and
equal
debate
it
is
almost
as
distinctly
dealing
with
a
foreign
power
as
were
the
negotiations
preceding
the
proposed
treaty
it
must
predispose
the
senate
to
the
temper
of
an
overseer
still
treaties
are
not
affairs
with
us
and
exceptional
business
may
create
in
senators
an
exceptional
sense
of
responsibility
and
dispose
them
to
an
unwonted
desire
to
be
dispassionate
and
fair
the
ratification
of
treaties
is
a
much
more
serious
matter
than
the
consideration
of
nominations
which
every
session
constitutes
so
constant
a
diversion
from
the
more
ponderous
business
of
legislation
it
is
in
dealing
with
nominations
however
that
there
is
the
most
friction
in
the
contact
between
the
president
and
his
overlord
the
senate
one
of
the
most
noteworthy
instances
of
the
improper
tactics
which
may
arise
out
of
these
relations
was
the
case
of
that
smythe
at
the
time
collector
for
the
port
of
new
york
whom
in
president
grant
nominated
minister
to
the
court
of
petersburg
the
nomination
as
looking
towards
an
appointment
to
diplomatic
service
was
referred
to
the
committee
on
foreign
relations
of
which
charles
sumner
was
then
chairman
that
committee
rejected
the
nomination
but
smythe
had
great
influence
at
his
back
and
was
himself
skilled
beyond
most
men
in
the
arts
of
the
lobby
he
accordingly
succeeded
in
securing
such
support
in
the
senate
as
to
become
a
very
formidable
dog
in
the
manger
not
himself
gaining
the
appointment
but
for
a
time
blocking
all
other
appointments
and
bringing
the
business
of
the
senate
altogether
to
a
because
he
could
not
smythe
himself
is
forgotten
but
no
observer
of
the
actual
conditions
of
senatorial
power
can
fail
to
see
the
grave
import
of
the
lesson
which
his
case
teaches
because
his
case
was
by
no
means
an
isolated
one
there
have
been
scores
of
others
quite
as
bad
and
we
could
have
no
assurance
that
there
might
not
in
the
future
be
hundreds
more
had
not
recent
movements
in
the
direction
of
a
radical
reform
of
the
civil
service
begun
to
make
nominations
represent
not
the
personal
preference
of
the
president
or
the
intrigues
of
other
people
but
honest
demonstrated
worth
which
the
senate
is
likely
to
feel
forced
to
accept
without
question
when
the
reform
reaches
the
highest
grades
of
the
service
in
discussing
the
senate
connection
with
the
civil
service
and
the
abuses
surrounding
that
connection
one
is
therefore
discussing
a
phase
of
congressional
government
which
promises
soon
to
become
obsolete
a
consummation
devoutly
to
be
wished
and
yet
sure
when
it
comes
to
rob
our
politics
of
a
feature
very
conspicuous
and
very
characteristic
and
in
a
sense
very
entertaining
there
are
not
many
things
in
the
proceedings
of
congress
which
the
people
care
to
observe
with
any
diligence
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
scandalous
transactions
in
the
senate
with
reference
to
nominations
were
among
the
few
things
that
the
country
watched
and
talked
about
with
keen
relish
and
interest
this
was
the
personal
element
which
always
had
spice
in
it
when
senator
conkling
resigned
in
a
huff
because
he
could
not
have
whom
he
liked
in
the
collectorship
of
the
port
of
new
york
the
country
rubbed
its
hands
and
when
the
same
imperious
politician
sought
reëlection
as
a
vindication
of
that
unconstitutional
control
of
nominations
which
masqueraded
as
the
courtesy
of
the
senate
the
country
discussed
his
chances
with
real
zest
and
chuckled
over
the
whole
affair
in
genuine
glee
it
was
a
big
fight
worth
seeing
it
would
have
been
too
bad
to
miss
it
before
the
sentiment
of
reform
had
become
strong
enough
to
check
it
this
abuse
of
the
consultative
privileges
of
the
senate
in
the
matter
of
nominations
had
assumed
such
proportions
as
to
seem
to
some
the
ugliest
deformity
in
our
politics
it
looked
as
if
it
were
becoming
at
once
the
weakest
and
the
most
tried
and
strained
joint
of
our
federal
system
if
there
was
to
be
a
break
would
it
not
be
there
where
was
the
severest
wear
and
tear
the
evil
practices
seemed
the
more
ineradicable
because
they
had
arisen
in
the
most
natural
manner
the
president
was
compelled
as
in
the
case
of
treaties
to
obtain
the
sanction
of
the
senate
without
being
allowed
any
chance
of
consultation
with
it
and
there
soon
grew
up
within
the
privacy
of
executive
session
an
understanding
that
the
wishes
and
opinions
of
each
senator
who
was
of
the
president
own
party
should
have
more
weight
than
even
the
inclinations
of
the
majority
in
deciding
upon
the
fitness
or
desirability
of
persons
proposed
to
be
appointed
to
offices
in
that
senator
state
there
was
the
requisite
privacy
to
shield
from
public
condemnation
the
practice
arising
out
of
such
an
understanding
and
the
president
himself
was
always
quite
out
of
earshot
hearing
only
of
results
of
final
votes
all
through
the
direct
dealings
of
the
senate
with
the
president
there
runs
this
characteristic
spirit
of
irresponsible
dictation
the
president
may
tire
the
senate
by
dogged
persistence
but
he
can
never
deal
with
it
upon
a
ground
of
real
equality
he
has
no
real
presence
in
the
senate
his
power
does
not
extend
beyond
the
most
general
suggestion
the
senate
always
has
the
last
word
no
one
would
desire
to
see
the
president
possessed
of
authority
to
overrule
the
decisions
of
the
senate
to
treat
with
foreign
powers
and
appoint
thousands
of
public
officers
without
any
other
than
that
shadowy
responsibility
which
he
owes
to
the
people
that
elected
him
but
it
is
certainly
an
unfortunate
feature
of
our
government
that
congress
governs
without
being
put
into
confidential
relations
with
the
agents
through
whom
it
governs
it
dictates
to
another
branch
of
the
government
which
was
intended
to
be
coördinate
and
coequal
with
it
and
over
which
it
has
no
legalized
authority
as
of
a
master
but
only
the
authority
of
a
bigger
stockholder
of
a
monopolist
indeed
of
all
the
energetic
prerogatives
of
the
government
it
is
as
if
the
army
and
navy
departments
were
to
be
made
coördinate
and
coequal
but
the
absolute
possession
and
control
of
all
ammunition
and
other
stores
of
war
given
to
the
one
and
denied
the
other
the
executive
is
taken
into
partnership
with
the
legislature
upon
a
salary
which
may
be
withheld
and
is
allowed
no
voice
in
the
management
of
the
business
it
is
simply
charged
with
the
superintendence
of
the
employees
it
was
not
essentially
different
in
the
early
days
when
the
president
in
person
read
his
message
to
the
senate
and
the
house
together
as
an
address
and
the
senate
in
a
body
carried
its
reply
to
the
executive
mansion
the
address
was
the
formal
communication
of
an
outsider
just
as
much
as
the
message
of
is
and
the
reply
of
the
senate
was
no
less
a
formal
document
which
it
turned
aside
from
its
regular
business
to
prepare
that
meeting
face
to
face
was
not
consultation
the
english
parliament
does
not
consult
with
the
sovereign
when
it
assembles
to
hear
the
address
from
the
throne
it
would
doubtless
be
considered
quite
improper
to
omit
from
an
essay
on
the
senate
all
mention
of
the
senate
president
and
yet
there
is
very
little
to
be
said
about
the
of
the
united
states
his
position
is
one
of
anomalous
insignificance
and
curious
uncertainty
apparently
he
is
not
strictly
speaking
a
part
of
the
legislature
he
is
clearly
not
a
member
yet
neither
is
he
an
officer
of
the
executive
it
is
one
of
the
remarkable
things
about
him
that
it
is
hard
to
find
in
sketching
the
government
any
proper
place
to
discuss
him
he
comes
in
most
naturally
along
with
the
senate
to
which
he
is
tacked
but
he
does
not
come
in
there
for
any
great
consideration
he
is
simply
a
judicial
officer
set
to
moderate
the
proceedings
of
an
assembly
whose
rules
he
has
had
no
voice
in
framing
and
can
have
no
voice
in
changing
his
official
stature
is
not
to
be
compared
with
that
of
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
representatives
so
long
as
he
is
he
is
inseparable
officially
from
the
senate
his
importance
consists
in
the
fact
that
he
may
cease
to
be
his
chief
dignity
next
to
presiding
over
the
senate
lies
in
the
circumstance
that
he
is
awaiting
the
death
or
disability
of
the
president
and
the
chief
embarrassment
in
discussing
his
office
is
that
in
explaining
how
little
there
is
to
be
said
about
it
one
has
evidently
said
all
there
is
to
say
the
executive
every
political
constitution
in
which
different
bodies
share
the
supreme
power
is
only
enabled
to
exist
by
the
forbearance
of
those
among
whom
this
power
is
lord
john
russell
simplicity
and
logical
neatness
are
not
the
good
to
be
aimed
at
in
politics
but
freedom
and
order
with
props
against
the
pressure
of
time
and
arbitrary
will
and
sudden
theo
woolsey
nothing
indeed
will
appear
more
certain
on
any
tolerable
consideration
of
this
matter
than
that
sort
of
government
ought
to
have
its
administration
correspondent
to
its
burke
it
is
at
once
curious
and
instructive
to
note
how
we
have
been
forced
into
practically
amending
the
constitution
without
constitutionally
amending
it
the
legal
processes
of
constitutional
change
are
so
slow
and
cumbersome
that
we
have
been
constrained
to
adopt
a
serviceable
framework
of
fictions
which
enables
us
easily
to
preserve
the
forms
without
laboriously
obeying
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
which
will
stretch
as
the
nation
grows
it
would
seem
that
no
impulse
short
of
the
impulse
of
no
force
less
than
the
force
of
revolution
can
nowadays
be
expected
to
move
the
cumbrous
machinery
of
formal
amendment
erected
in
article
five
that
must
be
a
tremendous
movement
of
opinion
which
can
sway
two
thirds
of
each
house
of
congress
and
the
people
of
three
fourths
of
the
states
bagehot
has
pointed
out
that
one
consequence
of
the
existence
of
this
next
to
immovable
machinery
is
that
the
most
obvious
evils
can
not
be
quickly
remedied
and
that
a
clumsy
working
and
a
curious
technicality
mark
the
politics
of
a
people
the
practical
arguments
and
legal
disquisitions
in
america
continues
he
are
often
like
those
of
trustees
carrying
out
a
misdrawn
will
the
sense
of
what
they
mean
is
good
but
it
can
never
be
worked
out
fully
or
defended
simply
so
hampered
is
it
by
the
old
words
of
an
old
testament
but
much
the
greater
consequence
is
that
we
have
resorted
almost
unconscious
of
the
political
significance
of
what
we
did
to
means
of
modifying
the
federal
system
where
it
has
proved
to
be
too
refined
by
balances
of
divided
authority
to
suit
practical
uses
to
be
out
of
square
with
the
main
principle
of
its
foundation
namely
government
by
the
people
through
their
representatives
in
congress
our
method
of
choosing
presidents
is
a
notable
illustration
of
these
remarks
the
difference
between
the
actual
and
the
constitutional
modes
is
the
difference
between
an
ideal
choice
and
a
choice
made
under
party
whips
the
difference
between
a
choice
made
by
independent
unpledged
electors
acting
apart
in
the
states
and
a
choice
made
by
a
national
party
convention
our
executive
no
less
than
the
english
and
french
executives
is
selected
by
a
representative
deliberative
body
though
in
england
and
france
the
election
is
controlled
by
a
permanent
legislative
chamber
and
here
by
a
transient
assembly
chosen
for
the
purpose
and
dying
with
the
execution
of
that
purpose
in
england
the
whole
cabinet
is
practically
elective
the
french
chambers
formally
elect
the
president
the
titular
head
of
the
government
and
the
president
regards
only
the
will
of
the
assembly
in
appointing
the
prime
minister
who
is
the
energetic
head
of
the
government
and
who
in
his
turn
surrounds
himself
with
colleagues
who
have
the
confidence
of
the
legislature
and
the
french
have
but
copied
the
english
constitution
which
makes
the
executive
ministry
the
representatives
of
the
party
majority
in
the
commons
with
us
on
the
other
hand
the
president
is
elected
by
one
representative
body
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
him
after
his
election
and
the
cabinet
must
be
approved
by
another
representative
body
which
has
nothing
directly
to
do
with
them
after
their
appointment
of
course
i
do
not
mean
that
the
choice
of
a
national
convention
is
literally
election
the
convention
only
nominates
a
candidate
but
that
candidate
is
the
only
man
for
whom
the
electors
of
his
party
can
vote
and
so
the
expression
of
the
preference
of
the
convention
of
the
dominant
party
is
practically
equivalent
to
election
and
might
as
well
be
called
election
by
any
one
who
is
writing
of
broad
facts
and
not
of
fine
distinctions
the
sovereign
in
england
picks
out
the
man
who
is
to
be
prime
minister
but
he
must
pick
where
the
commons
point
and
so
it
is
simpler
as
well
as
perfectly
true
to
say
that
the
commons
elect
the
prime
minister
my
agent
does
not
select
the
particular
horse
i
instruct
him
to
buy
this
is
just
the
plain
fact
that
the
electors
are
the
agents
of
the
national
conventions
and
this
fact
constitutes
more
than
an
amendment
of
that
original
plan
which
would
have
had
all
the
electors
to
be
what
the
first
electors
actually
were
trustworthy
men
given
to
vote
for
whom
they
pleased
casting
their
ballots
in
thirteen
state
capitals
in
the
hope
that
they
would
happen
upon
a
majority
agreement
it
is
worth
while
too
to
notice
another
peculiarity
of
this
elective
system
there
is
a
minority
representation
in
the
assemblies
which
govern
our
elections
across
the
ocean
a
liberal
prime
minister
is
selected
by
the
representatives
only
of
those
liberals
who
live
in
liberal
constituencies
those
who
live
elsewhere
in
a
helpless
minority
in
a
conservative
district
having
of
course
no
voice
in
the
selection
a
conservative
premier
in
like
manner
owes
nothing
to
those
conservatives
who
were
unable
to
return
a
member
to
parliament
so
far
as
he
is
concerned
they
count
for
liberals
since
their
representative
in
the
commons
is
a
liberal
the
parliaments
which
select
our
presidents
on
the
contrary
are
each
of
them
all
of
a
kind
no
state
district
can
have
so
few
republicans
in
it
as
not
to
be
entitled
to
a
representative
in
the
national
republican
convention
equal
to
that
of
the
most
unanimously
republican
district
in
the
country
and
a
republican
state
is
accorded
as
full
a
representation
in
a
democratic
convention
as
is
the
most
democratic
of
her
sister
states
we
had
to
pass
through
several
stages
of
development
before
the
present
system
of
election
by
convention
was
reached
at
the
first
two
presidential
elections
the
electors
were
left
free
to
vote
as
their
consciences
and
the
constitution
bade
them
for
the
constitution
bade
them
vote
as
they
deemed
best
and
it
did
not
require
much
discretion
to
vote
for
general
washington
but
when
general
washington
was
out
of
the
race
and
new
parties
began
to
dispute
the
field
with
the
federalists
party
managers
could
not
help
feeling
anxious
about
the
votes
of
the
electors
and
some
of
those
named
to
choose
the
second
president
were
accordingly
pledged
beforehand
to
vote
thus
and
so
after
the
third
presidential
election
there
began
to
be
congressional
oversight
of
the
matter
from
to
there
was
an
unbroken
succession
of
caucuses
of
the
republican
members
of
congress
to
direct
the
action
of
the
party
electors
and
nomination
by
caucus
died
only
when
the
republican
party
became
virtually
the
only
party
worth
reckoning
with
the
only
party
for
whom
nomination
was
worth
while
and
then
public
opinion
began
to
cry
out
against
such
secret
direction
of
the
monopoly
in
the
federalist
congressmen
had
held
an
informal
caucus
to
ascertain
their
minds
as
to
the
approaching
election
but
after
that
they
refrained
from
further
experiment
in
the
same
direction
and
contented
themselves
with
now
and
then
a
sort
of
convention
until
they
had
no
party
to
convene
in
there
was
a
sort
of
dropping
fire
of
nominations
from
state
legislatures
and
in
sat
the
first
of
the
great
national
nominating
conventions
there
was
therefore
one
form
of
congressional
government
which
did
not
succeed
it
was
a
very
logical
mode
of
party
government
that
of
nominating
the
chief
magistrate
by
congressional
caucus
but
it
was
not
an
open
enough
way
the
french
chamber
does
not
select
premiers
by
shutting
up
the
members
of
its
majority
in
caucus
neither
does
the
house
of
commons
their
selection
is
made
by
long
and
open
trial
in
debate
and
in
business
management
of
the
men
in
whom
they
discover
most
tact
for
leading
and
most
skill
for
planning
as
well
as
most
power
for
ruling
they
do
not
say
by
vote
give
us
ferry
give
us
gladstone
but
her
majesty
knows
as
well
as
her
subjects
know
that
gladstone
is
the
only
man
whom
the
liberal
majority
will
obey
and
president
grévy
perceives
that
ferry
is
the
only
man
whom
the
chambers
can
be
made
to
follow
each
has
elected
himself
by
winning
the
first
place
in
his
party
the
election
has
openly
progressed
for
years
and
is
quite
different
from
the
private
vote
of
a
caucus
about
an
outsider
who
is
to
sit
not
in
congress
but
in
the
executive
mansion
who
is
not
their
man
but
the
people
nor
would
nominations
by
state
legislatures
answer
any
rational
purpose
of
course
every
state
had
or
thought
she
had
which
is
much
the
same
thing
some
citizen
worthy
to
become
president
and
it
would
have
been
confusion
worse
confounded
to
have
had
as
many
candidates
as
there
might
be
states
so
universal
a
competition
between
favorite
sons
would
have
thrown
the
election
into
the
house
of
representatives
so
regularly
as
to
replace
the
nominating
caucus
by
an
electing
caucus
the
virtual
election
of
the
cabinet
the
real
executive
or
at
least
the
prime
minister
the
real
head
of
the
executive
by
the
commons
in
england
furnishes
us
with
a
contrast
rather
than
with
a
parallel
to
the
election
of
our
premier
the
head
of
our
executive
by
a
deliberative
representative
body
because
of
the
difference
of
function
and
of
tenure
between
our
presidents
and
english
prime
ministers
william
pitt
was
elected
to
rule
the
house
of
commons
john
adams
to
hold
a
constitutional
balance
against
the
houses
of
congress
the
one
was
the
leader
of
the
legislature
the
other
so
to
say
the
colleague
of
the
legislature
besides
the
commons
can
not
only
make
but
also
unmake
ministries
whilst
conventions
can
do
nothing
but
bind
their
parties
by
nomination
and
nothing
short
of
a
impossible
impeachment
can
unmake
a
president
except
four
successions
of
the
seasons
as
has
been
very
happily
said
by
a
shrewd
critic
our
system
is
essentially
astronomical
a
president
usefulness
is
measured
not
by
efficiency
but
by
calendar
months
it
is
reckoned
that
if
he
be
good
at
all
he
will
be
good
for
four
years
a
prime
minister
must
keep
himself
in
favor
with
the
majority
a
president
need
only
keep
alive
once
the
functions
of
a
presidential
elector
were
very
august
he
was
to
speak
for
the
people
they
were
to
accept
his
judgment
as
theirs
he
was
to
be
as
eminent
in
the
qualities
which
win
trust
as
was
the
greatest
of
the
imperial
electors
in
the
power
which
inspires
fear
but
now
he
is
merely
a
registering
machine
a
sort
of
to
the
hand
of
his
party
convention
it
gives
the
pressure
and
he
rings
it
is
therefore
patent
to
every
one
that
that
portion
of
the
constitution
which
prescribes
his
functions
is
as
though
it
were
not
a
very
simple
and
natural
process
of
party
organization
taking
form
first
in
congressional
caucuses
and
later
in
nominating
conventions
has
radically
altered
a
constitution
which
declares
that
it
can
be
amended
only
by
the
concurrence
of
two
thirds
of
congress
and
three
fourths
of
the
states
the
sagacious
men
of
the
constitutional
convention
of
certainly
expected
their
work
to
be
altered
but
can
hardly
have
expected
it
to
be
changed
in
so
informal
a
manner
the
conditions
which
determine
the
choice
of
a
nominating
convention
which
names
a
president
are
radically
different
from
the
conditions
which
facilitate
the
choice
of
a
representative
chamber
which
selects
for
itself
a
prime
minister
among
the
great
purposes
of
a
national
parliament
are
these
two
says
parton
first
to
train
men
for
practical
statesmanship
and
secondly
to
exhibit
them
to
the
country
so
that
when
men
of
ability
are
wanted
they
can
be
found
without
anxious
search
and
perilous
trial
in
those
governments
which
are
administered
by
an
executive
committee
of
the
legislative
body
not
only
this
training
but
also
this
exhibition
is
constant
and
complete
the
career
which
leads
to
cabinet
office
is
a
career
of
the
is
made
in
debate
and
so
is
made
to
the
nation
at
large
as
well
as
to
the
ministry
of
the
day
who
are
looking
out
for
able
recruits
and
to
the
commons
whose
ear
is
quick
to
tell
a
voice
which
it
will
consent
to
hear
a
knowledge
which
it
will
pause
to
heed
but
in
governments
like
our
own
in
which
legislative
and
executive
services
are
altogether
dissociated
this
training
is
incomplete
and
this
exhibition
almost
entirely
wanting
a
nominating
convention
does
not
look
over
the
rolls
of
congress
to
pick
a
man
to
suit
its
purpose
and
if
it
did
it
could
not
find
him
because
congress
is
not
a
school
for
the
preparation
of
administrators
and
the
convention
is
supposed
to
be
searching
not
for
an
experienced
but
for
a
tried
statesman
the
proper
test
for
its
application
is
not
the
test
by
which
congressmen
are
assayed
they
make
laws
but
they
do
not
have
to
order
the
execution
of
the
laws
they
make
they
have
a
great
deal
of
experience
in
directing
but
none
at
all
in
being
directed
their
care
is
to
pass
bills
not
to
keep
them
in
running
order
after
they
have
become
statutes
they
spend
their
lives
without
having
anything
to
do
directly
with
administration
though
administration
is
dependent
upon
the
measures
which
they
enact
a
presidential
convention
therefore
when
it
nominates
a
man
who
is
or
has
been
a
member
of
congress
does
not
nominate
him
because
of
his
congressional
experience
but
because
it
is
thought
that
he
has
other
abilities
which
were
not
called
out
in
congress
andrew
jackson
had
been
a
member
of
congress
but
he
was
chosen
president
because
he
had
won
the
battle
of
new
orleans
and
had
driven
the
indians
from
florida
it
was
thought
that
his
military
genius
evinced
executive
genius
the
men
whose
fame
rests
altogether
upon
laurels
won
in
congress
have
seldom
been
more
successful
than
webster
and
henry
clay
in
their
candidacy
for
the
chief
magistracy
washington
was
a
soldier
jefferson
cut
but
a
sorry
figure
in
debate
monroe
was
a
diplomatist
it
required
diligent
inquiry
to
find
out
what
many
of
our
presidents
had
been
before
they
became
candidates
and
eminency
in
legislative
service
has
always
been
at
best
but
an
uncertain
road
to
official
preferment
of
late
years
a
tendency
is
observable
which
seems
to
be
making
the
gubernatorial
chairs
of
the
greater
states
the
nearest
offices
to
the
presidency
and
it
can
not
but
be
allowed
that
there
is
much
that
is
rational
in
the
tendency
the
governorship
of
a
state
is
very
like
a
smaller
presidency
or
rather
the
presidency
is
very
like
a
big
governorship
training
in
the
duties
of
the
one
fits
for
the
duties
of
the
other
this
is
the
only
avenue
of
subordinate
place
through
which
the
highest
place
can
be
naturally
reached
under
the
cabinet
governments
abroad
a
still
more
natural
line
of
promotion
is
arranged
the
ministry
is
a
legislative
ministry
and
draws
its
life
from
the
legislature
where
strong
talents
always
secure
executive
place
a
long
career
in
parliament
is
at
least
a
long
contact
with
practical
statesmanship
and
at
best
a
long
schooling
in
the
duties
of
the
practical
statesman
but
with
us
there
is
no
such
intimate
relationship
between
legislative
and
executive
service
from
experience
in
state
administration
to
trial
in
the
larger
sphere
of
federal
administration
is
the
only
natural
order
of
promotion
we
ought
therefore
to
hail
the
recognition
of
this
fact
as
in
keeping
with
the
general
plan
of
the
federal
constitution
the
business
of
the
president
occasionally
great
is
usually
not
much
above
routine
most
of
the
time
it
is
administration
mere
obedience
of
directions
from
the
masters
of
policy
the
standing
committees
except
in
so
far
as
his
power
of
veto
constitutes
him
a
part
of
the
legislature
the
president
might
not
inconveniently
be
a
permanent
officer
the
first
official
of
a
and
impartially
regulated
civil
service
system
through
whose
sure
series
of
the
youngest
clerk
might
rise
even
to
the
chief
magistracy
he
is
part
of
the
official
rather
than
of
the
political
machinery
of
the
government
and
his
duties
call
rather
for
training
than
for
constructive
genius
if
there
can
be
found
in
the
official
systems
of
the
states
a
lower
grade
of
service
in
which
men
may
be
advantageously
drilled
for
presidential
functions
so
much
the
better
the
states
will
have
better
governors
the
union
better
presidents
and
there
will
have
been
supplied
one
of
the
most
serious
needs
left
unsupplied
by
the
constitution
the
need
for
a
proper
school
in
which
to
rear
federal
administrators
administration
is
something
that
men
must
learn
not
something
to
skill
in
which
they
are
born
americans
take
to
business
of
all
kinds
more
naturally
than
any
other
nation
ever
did
and
the
executive
duties
of
government
constitute
just
an
exalted
kind
of
business
but
even
americans
are
not
presidents
in
their
cradles
one
can
not
have
too
much
preparatory
training
and
experience
who
is
to
fill
so
high
a
magistracy
it
is
difficult
to
perceive
therefore
upon
what
safe
ground
of
reason
are
built
the
opinions
of
those
persons
who
regard
short
terms
of
service
as
sacredly
and
peculiarly
republican
in
principle
if
republicanism
is
founded
upon
good
sense
nothing
so
far
removed
from
good
sense
can
be
part
and
parcel
of
it
efficiency
is
the
only
just
foundation
for
confidence
in
a
public
officer
under
republican
institutions
no
less
than
under
monarchs
and
short
terms
which
cut
off
the
efficient
as
surely
and
inexorably
as
the
inefficient
are
quite
as
repugnant
to
republican
as
to
monarchical
rules
of
wisdom
unhappily
however
this
is
not
american
doctrine
a
president
is
dismissed
almost
as
soon
as
he
has
learned
the
duties
of
his
office
and
a
man
who
has
served
a
dozen
terms
in
congress
is
a
curiosity
we
are
too
apt
to
think
both
the
work
of
legislation
and
the
work
of
administration
easy
enough
to
be
done
readily
with
or
without
preparation
by
any
man
of
discretion
and
character
no
one
imagines
that
the
or
the
hardware
trade
or
even
the
cobbler
craft
can
be
successfully
conducted
except
by
those
who
have
worked
through
a
laborious
and
unremunerative
apprenticeship
and
who
have
devoted
their
lives
to
perfecting
themselves
as
tradesmen
or
as
menders
of
shoes
but
legislation
is
esteemed
a
thing
which
may
be
taken
up
with
success
by
any
shrewd
man
of
middle
age
which
a
lawyer
may
now
and
again
advantageously
combine
with
his
practice
or
of
which
any
intelligent
youth
may
easily
catch
the
knack
and
administration
is
regarded
as
something
which
an
old
soldier
an
or
a
popular
politician
may
be
trusted
to
take
to
by
instinct
no
man
of
tolerable
talents
need
despair
of
having
been
born
a
presidential
candidate
these
must
be
pronounced
very
extraordinary
conclusions
for
an
eminently
practical
people
to
have
accepted
and
it
must
be
received
as
an
awakening
of
good
sense
that
there
is
nowadays
a
decided
inclination
manifested
on
the
part
of
the
nation
to
supply
for
the
presidency
in
like
minor
offices
such
as
the
governorships
of
the
greater
states
for
the
sort
of
presidents
needed
under
the
present
arrangement
of
our
federal
government
it
is
best
to
choose
amongst
the
ablest
and
most
experienced
state
governors
so
much
for
nomination
and
election
but
after
election
what
then
the
president
is
not
all
of
the
executive
he
can
not
get
along
without
the
men
whom
he
appoints
with
and
by
the
consent
and
advice
of
the
senate
and
they
are
really
integral
parts
of
that
branch
of
the
government
which
he
titularly
contains
in
his
one
single
person
the
characters
and
training
of
the
secretaries
are
of
almost
as
much
importance
as
his
own
gifts
and
antecedents
so
that
his
appointment
and
the
senate
confirmation
must
be
added
to
the
machinery
of
nomination
by
convention
and
election
by
automatic
electors
before
the
whole
process
of
making
up
a
working
executive
has
been
noted
the
early
congresses
seem
to
have
regarded
the
and
the
four
secretaries
who
constituted
the
first
cabinets
as
something
more
than
the
president
lieutenants
before
the
republican
reaction
which
followed
the
supremacy
of
the
federalists
the
heads
of
the
departments
appeared
in
person
before
the
houses
to
impart
desired
information
and
to
make
what
suggestions
they
might
have
to
venture
just
as
the
president
attended
in
person
to
read
his
address
they
were
always
recognized
units
in
the
system
never
mere
ciphers
to
the
presidential
figure
which
led
them
their
wills
counted
as
independent
wills
the
limits
of
this
independence
would
seem
however
never
to
have
been
very
clearly
defined
whether
or
not
the
president
was
to
take
the
advice
of
his
appointees
and
colleagues
appears
to
have
depended
always
upon
the
character
and
temper
of
the
president
here
for
example
is
what
was
reported
in
we
pretend
to
no
state
secrets
said
the
new
york
evening
post
but
we
have
been
told
upon
what
we
deem
good
authority
that
no
such
thing
as
a
combined
unitary
deliberative
administration
exists
that
the
president
brave
willingness
to
take
all
responsibility
has
quite
neutralized
the
idea
of
a
joint
responsibility
and
that
orders
of
the
highest
importance
are
issued
and
movements
commanded
which
cabinet
officers
learn
of
as
other
people
do
or
what
is
worse
which
the
cabinet
officers
disapprove
and
protest
against
each
cabinet
officer
again
controls
his
own
department
pretty
much
as
he
pleases
without
consultation
with
the
president
or
with
his
coadjutors
and
often
in
the
face
of
determinations
which
have
been
reached
by
the
others
a
picture
this
which
forcibly
reminds
one
of
a
certain
imperious
prime
minister
in
his
last
days
created
earl
of
chatham
these
reports
may
have
been
true
or
they
may
have
been
mere
rumors
but
they
depict
a
perfectly
possible
state
of
affairs
there
is
no
influence
except
the
ascendency
or
tact
of
the
president
himself
to
keep
a
cabinet
in
harmony
and
to
dispose
it
to
coöperation
so
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
lay
down
any
rules
as
to
what
elements
really
constitute
an
executive
those
elements
can
be
determined
exactly
of
only
one
administration
at
a
time
and
of
that
only
after
it
has
closed
and
some
one
who
knows
its
secrets
has
come
forward
to
tell
them
we
think
of
lincoln
rather
than
of
his
secretaries
when
we
look
back
to
the
policy
of
the
but
we
think
of
hamilton
rather
than
of
president
washington
when
we
look
back
to
the
policy
of
the
first
administration
daniel
webster
was
bigger
than
president
fillmore
and
president
jackson
was
bigger
than
secretary
van
buren
it
depends
for
the
most
part
upon
the
character
and
training
the
previous
station
of
the
cabinet
officers
whether
or
not
they
act
as
governing
factors
in
administration
just
as
it
depends
upon
the
president
talents
and
preparatory
schooling
whether
or
not
he
is
a
mere
a
weak
president
may
prove
himself
wiser
than
the
convention
which
nominated
him
by
overshadowing
himself
with
a
cabinet
of
notables
from
the
necessity
of
the
case
however
the
president
can
not
often
be
really
supreme
in
matters
of
administration
except
as
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
representatives
is
supreme
in
legislation
as
appointer
of
those
who
are
supreme
in
its
several
departments
the
president
is
no
greater
than
his
prerogative
of
veto
makes
him
he
is
in
other
words
powerful
rather
as
a
branch
of
the
legislature
than
as
the
titular
head
of
the
executive
almost
all
distinctively
executive
functions
are
specifically
bestowed
upon
the
heads
of
the
departments
no
president
however
earnest
and
industrious
can
keep
the
navy
in
a
state
of
creditable
efficiency
if
he
have
a
corrupt
or
incapable
secretary
in
the
navy
department
he
can
not
prevent
the
army
from
suffering
the
damage
of
demoralization
if
the
secretary
of
war
is
without
either
ability
experience
or
conscience
there
will
be
corrupt
jobs
in
the
department
of
justice
do
what
he
will
to
correct
the
methods
of
a
deceived
or
deceitful
he
can
not
secure
equity
for
the
indian
tribes
if
the
secretary
of
the
interior
chooses
to
thwart
him
and
the
secretary
of
state
may
do
as
much
mischief
behind
his
back
as
can
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
he
might
master
the
details
and
so
control
the
administration
of
some
one
of
the
departments
but
he
can
scarcely
oversee
them
all
with
any
degree
of
strictness
his
knowledge
of
what
they
have
done
or
are
doing
comes
of
course
from
the
secretaries
themselves
and
his
annual
messages
to
congress
are
in
large
part
but
a
recapitulation
of
the
chief
contents
of
the
detailed
reports
which
the
heads
of
the
departments
themselves
submit
at
the
same
time
to
the
houses
it
is
easy
however
to
exaggerate
the
power
of
the
cabinet
after
all
has
been
said
it
is
evident
that
they
differ
from
the
permanent
officials
only
in
not
being
permanent
their
tenure
of
office
is
made
to
depend
upon
the
supposition
that
their
functions
are
political
rather
than
simply
ministerial
independent
rather
than
merely
instrumental
they
are
made
party
representatives
because
of
the
fiction
that
they
direct
policy
in
reality
the
first
comptroller
of
the
treasury
has
almost
if
not
quite
as
much
weight
in
directing
departmental
business
as
has
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
himself
and
it
would
practically
be
quite
as
useful
to
have
his
office
which
is
in
intention
permanent
vacated
by
every
change
of
administration
as
to
have
that
rule
with
regard
to
the
office
of
his
official
chief
the
permanent
organization
the
clerical
forces
of
the
departments
have
in
the
secretaries
a
sort
of
though
it
would
probably
be
just
as
convenient
in
practice
to
have
this
lid
permanent
as
to
have
it
movable
that
the
secretaries
are
not
in
fact
the
directors
of
the
executive
policy
of
the
government
i
have
shown
in
pointing
out
the
supervision
of
even
the
details
of
administration
which
it
is
the
disposition
of
the
standing
committees
of
congress
to
exercise
in
the
actual
control
of
affairs
no
one
can
do
very
much
without
gaining
the
ears
of
the
committees
the
heads
of
the
departments
could
of
course
act
much
more
wisely
in
many
matters
than
the
committees
can
because
they
have
an
intimacy
with
the
workings
and
the
wants
of
those
departments
which
no
committee
can
possibly
possess
but
committees
prefer
to
govern
in
the
dark
rather
than
not
to
govern
at
all
and
the
secretaries
as
a
matter
of
fact
find
themselves
bound
in
all
things
larger
than
routine
details
by
laws
which
have
been
made
for
them
and
which
they
have
no
legitimate
means
of
modifying
of
course
the
secretaries
are
in
the
of
statutes
and
all
their
duties
look
towards
a
strict
obedience
to
congress
congress
made
them
and
can
unmake
them
it
is
to
congress
that
they
must
render
account
for
the
conduct
of
administration
the
head
of
each
department
must
every
year
make
a
detailed
report
of
the
expenditures
of
the
department
and
a
minute
account
of
the
facilities
of
work
and
the
division
of
functions
in
the
department
naming
each
clerk
of
its
force
the
chief
duties
of
one
cabinet
officer
will
serve
to
illustrate
the
chief
duties
of
his
colleagues
it
is
the
duty
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
prepare
plans
for
the
improvement
and
management
of
the
revenue
and
for
the
support
of
the
public
credit
to
prescribe
forms
of
keeping
and
rendering
all
public
accounts
to
grant
all
warrants
for
moneys
to
be
issued
from
the
treasury
in
pursuance
of
appropriations
made
by
congress
to
report
to
the
senate
or
house
in
person
or
in
writing
information
required
by
them
pertaining
to
his
office
and
to
perform
all
duties
relating
to
finance
that
he
shall
be
directed
to
perform
he
is
required
to
report
to
congress
annually
on
the
first
monday
in
june
the
results
of
the
information
compiled
by
the
bureau
of
statistics
showing
the
condition
of
manufactures
domestic
trade
currency
and
banks
in
the
several
states
and
territories
he
prescribes
regulations
for
the
killing
in
alaska
territory
and
adjacent
waters
of
minks
martens
sable
and
other
animals
and
he
must
lay
before
congress
each
session
the
reports
of
the
auditors
showing
the
applications
of
the
appropriations
made
for
the
war
and
navy
departments
and
also
abstracts
and
tabulated
forms
showing
separate
accounts
of
the
moneys
received
from
internal
duties
of
course
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
a
secretary
who
has
within
his
choice
some
of
the
minor
plans
for
the
management
of
the
revenue
and
for
the
maintenance
of
the
public
credit
should
be
carefully
chosen
from
amongst
men
skilled
in
financial
administration
and
experienced
in
business
regulation
but
it
is
no
more
necessary
that
the
man
selected
for
such
responsible
duties
should
be
an
active
politician
called
to
preside
over
his
department
only
so
long
as
the
president
who
appointed
him
continues
to
hold
office
and
to
like
him
than
it
is
to
have
a
strictly
political
officer
to
fulfill
his
other
duty
of
prescribing
game
laws
for
alaska
and
alaskan
waters
animals
can
have
no
connection
with
political
parties
except
perhaps
as
spoils
indeed
it
is
a
positive
disadvantage
that
secretary
should
be
chosen
upon
such
a
principle
he
can
not
have
the
knowledge
and
must
therefore
lack
the
efficiency
of
a
permanent
official
separated
from
the
partisan
conflicts
of
politics
and
advanced
to
the
highest
office
of
his
department
by
a
regular
series
of
promotions
won
by
long
service
the
general
policy
of
the
government
in
matters
of
finance
everything
that
affects
the
greater
operations
of
the
treasury
depends
upon
legislation
and
is
altogether
in
the
hands
of
the
committees
of
ways
and
means
and
of
finance
so
that
it
is
entirely
apart
from
good
sense
to
make
an
essentially
political
office
out
of
the
post
of
that
officer
who
controls
only
administrative
details
and
this
remark
would
seem
to
apply
with
still
greater
force
to
the
offices
of
the
other
secretaries
they
have
even
lass
energetic
scope
than
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
has
there
must
under
any
system
be
considerable
power
in
the
hands
of
the
officer
who
handles
and
dispenses
vast
revenues
even
though
he
handle
and
dispense
them
as
directed
by
his
employers
money
in
its
goings
to
and
fro
makes
various
mares
go
by
the
way
so
to
speak
it
can
not
move
in
great
quantities
without
moving
a
large
part
of
the
commercial
world
with
it
management
even
of
financial
details
may
be
made
instrumental
in
turning
the
upside
down
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
is
therefore
less
a
mere
chief
clerk
than
are
his
coadjutors
and
if
his
duties
are
not
properly
political
theirs
certainly
are
not
in
view
of
this
peculiarity
of
the
secretaries
in
being
appointed
as
partisans
and
endowed
as
mere
officials
it
is
interesting
to
inquire
what
and
whom
they
represent
they
are
clearly
meant
to
represent
the
political
party
to
which
they
belong
but
it
very
often
happens
that
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
do
so
they
must
sometimes
obey
the
opposite
party
it
is
our
habit
to
speak
of
the
party
to
which
the
president
is
known
to
adhere
and
which
has
control
of
appointments
to
the
offices
of
the
civil
service
as
the
party
in
power
but
it
is
very
evident
that
control
of
the
executive
machinery
is
not
all
or
even
a
very
large
part
of
power
in
a
country
ruled
as
ours
is
in
so
far
as
the
president
is
an
executive
officer
he
is
the
servant
of
congress
and
the
members
of
the
cabinet
being
confined
to
executive
functions
are
altogether
the
servants
of
congress
the
president
however
besides
being
titular
head
of
the
executive
service
is
to
the
extent
of
his
veto
a
third
branch
of
the
legislature
and
the
party
which
he
represents
is
in
power
in
the
same
sense
that
it
would
be
in
power
if
it
had
on
its
side
a
majority
of
the
members
of
either
of
the
other
two
branches
of
congress
if
the
house
and
senate
are
of
one
party
and
the
president
and
his
ministers
of
the
opposite
the
president
party
can
hardly
be
said
to
be
in
power
beyond
the
hindering
and
thwarting
faculty
of
the
veto
the
democrats
were
in
power
during
the
sessions
of
the
congress
because
they
had
a
majority
in
the
senate
as
well
as
andrew
jackson
in
the
white
house
but
later
presidents
have
had
both
house
and
senate
against
them
it
is
this
constant
possibility
of
party
diversity
between
the
executive
and
congress
which
so
much
complicates
our
system
of
party
government
the
history
of
administrations
is
not
necessarily
the
history
of
parties
presidential
elections
may
turn
the
scale
of
party
ascendency
one
way
and
the
intermediate
congressional
elections
may
quite
reverse
the
balance
a
strong
party
administration
by
which
the
energy
of
the
state
is
concentrated
in
the
hands
of
a
single
political
organization
which
is
by
reason
of
its
power
saddled
with
all
responsibility
may
sometimes
be
possible
but
it
must
often
be
impossible
we
are
thus
shut
out
in
part
from
real
party
government
such
as
we
desire
and
such
as
it
is
unquestionably
desirable
to
set
up
in
every
system
like
ours
party
government
can
exist
only
when
the
absolute
control
of
administration
the
appointment
of
its
officers
as
well
as
the
direction
of
its
means
and
policy
is
given
immediately
into
the
hands
of
that
branch
of
the
government
whose
power
is
paramount
the
representative
body
roger
sherman
whose
perception
was
amongst
the
keenest
and
whose
sagacity
was
amongst
the
surest
in
the
great
convention
of
was
very
bold
and
outspoken
in
declaring
this
fact
and
in
proposing
to
give
it
candid
recognition
perceiving
very
clearly
the
omnipotence
which
must
inevitably
belong
to
a
national
congress
such
as
the
convention
was
about
to
create
he
avowed
that
he
considered
the
executive
magistracy
as
nothing
more
than
an
institution
for
carrying
the
will
of
the
legislature
into
effect
that
the
person
or
persons
who
should
constitute
the
executive
ought
to
be
appointed
by
and
accountable
to
the
legislature
only
which
was
the
depository
of
the
supreme
will
of
the
society
indeed
the
executive
was
in
his
view
so
entirely
the
servant
of
the
legislative
will
that
he
saw
good
reason
to
think
that
the
legislature
should
judge
of
the
number
of
persons
of
which
the
executive
should
be
composed
and
there
seem
to
have
been
others
in
the
convention
who
went
along
with
him
in
substantial
agreement
as
to
these
matters
it
would
seem
to
have
been
only
a
desire
for
the
creation
of
as
many
as
possible
of
those
balances
of
power
which
now
decorate
the
literary
theory
of
the
constitution
which
they
made
that
prevented
a
universal
acquiescence
in
these
views
the
anomaly
which
has
resulted
is
seen
most
clearly
in
the
party
relations
of
the
president
and
his
cabinet
the
president
is
a
partisan
is
elected
because
he
is
a
partisan
and
yet
he
not
infrequently
negatives
the
legislation
passed
by
the
party
whom
he
represents
and
it
may
be
said
to
be
nowadays
a
very
rare
thing
to
find
a
cabinet
made
up
of
truly
representative
party
men
they
are
the
men
of
his
party
whom
the
president
likes
but
not
necessarily
or
always
the
men
whom
that
party
relishes
so
low
indeed
has
the
reputation
of
some
of
our
later
cabinets
fallen
even
in
the
eyes
of
men
of
their
own
political
connection
that
writers
in
the
best
of
our
public
prints
feel
at
full
liberty
to
speak
of
their
members
with
open
contempt
when
was
made
secretary
of
the
navy
laughs
the
new
york
nation
no
one
doubted
that
he
would
treat
the
department
as
and
consequently
nobody
has
been
disappointed
he
is
one
of
the
statesmen
who
can
hardly
conceive
of
a
branch
of
the
public
administration
having
no
spoils
in
it
and
that
this
separation
of
the
cabinet
from
real
party
influence
and
from
the
party
leadership
which
would
seem
properly
to
belong
to
its
official
station
is
a
natural
result
of
our
constitutional
scheme
is
made
patent
in
the
fact
that
the
cabinet
has
advanced
in
party
insignificance
as
the
system
has
grown
older
the
connection
between
the
early
cabinets
and
the
early
congresses
was
very
like
the
relations
between
leaders
and
their
party
both
hamilton
and
gallatin
led
rather
than
obeyed
the
houses
and
it
was
many
years
before
the
suggestions
of
heads
of
departments
ceased
to
be
sure
of
respectful
and
acquiescent
consideration
from
the
legislative
committees
but
as
the
committees
gained
facility
and
power
the
leadership
of
the
cabinet
lost
ground
congress
took
command
of
the
government
so
soon
as
ever
it
got
command
of
itself
and
no
secretary
of
can
claim
by
virtue
of
his
office
recognition
as
a
party
authority
congress
looks
upon
advice
offered
to
it
by
anybody
but
its
own
members
as
gratuitous
impertinence
at
the
same
time
it
is
quite
evident
that
the
means
which
congress
has
of
controlling
the
departments
and
of
exercising
the
searching
oversight
at
which
it
aims
are
limited
and
defective
its
intercourse
with
the
president
is
restricted
to
the
executive
messages
and
its
intercourse
with
the
departments
has
no
easier
channels
than
private
consultations
between
executive
officials
and
the
committees
informal
interviews
of
the
ministers
with
individual
members
of
congress
and
the
written
correspondence
which
the
cabinet
officers
from
time
to
time
address
to
the
presiding
officers
of
the
two
houses
at
stated
intervals
or
in
response
to
formal
resolutions
of
inquiry
congress
stands
almost
helplessly
outside
of
the
departments
even
the
special
irksome
ungracious
investigations
which
it
from
time
to
time
institutes
in
its
spasmodic
endeavors
to
dispel
or
confirm
suspicions
of
malfeasance
or
of
wanton
corruption
do
not
afford
it
more
than
a
glimpse
of
the
inside
of
a
small
province
of
federal
administration
hostile
or
designing
officials
can
always
hold
it
at
arm
length
by
dexterous
evasions
and
concealments
it
can
violently
disturb
but
it
can
not
often
fathom
the
waters
of
the
sea
in
which
the
bigger
fish
of
the
civil
service
swim
and
feed
its
dragnet
stirs
without
cleansing
the
bottom
unless
it
have
at
the
head
of
the
departments
capable
fearless
men
altogether
in
its
confidence
and
entirely
in
sympathy
with
its
designs
it
is
clearly
helpless
to
do
more
than
affright
those
officials
whose
consciences
are
their
accusers
and
it
is
easy
to
see
how
the
commands
as
well
as
the
questions
of
congress
may
be
evaded
if
not
directly
disobeyed
by
the
executive
agents
its
committees
may
command
but
they
can
not
superintend
the
execution
of
their
commands
the
secretaries
though
not
free
enough
to
have
any
independent
policy
of
their
own
are
free
enough
to
be
very
poor
because
very
unmanageable
servants
once
installed
their
hold
upon
their
offices
does
not
depend
upon
the
will
of
congress
if
they
please
the
president
and
keep
upon
living
terms
with
their
colleagues
they
need
not
seriously
regard
the
displeasure
of
the
houses
unless
indeed
by
actual
crime
they
rashly
put
themselves
in
the
way
of
its
judicial
wrath
if
their
folly
be
not
too
overt
and
extravagant
their
authority
may
continue
theirs
till
the
earth
has
four
times
made
her
annual
journey
round
the
sun
they
may
make
daily
blunders
in
administration
and
repeated
mistakes
in
business
may
thwart
the
plans
of
congress
in
a
hundred
small
vexatious
ways
and
yet
all
the
while
snap
their
fingers
at
its
dissatisfaction
or
displeasure
they
are
denied
the
gratification
of
possessing
real
power
but
they
have
the
satisfaction
of
being
secure
in
a
petty
independence
which
gives
them
a
chance
to
be
tricky
and
scheming
there
are
ways
and
ways
of
obeying
and
if
congress
be
not
pleased
why
need
they
care
congress
did
not
give
them
their
places
and
can
not
easily
take
them
away
still
it
remains
true
that
all
the
big
affairs
of
the
departments
are
conducted
in
obedience
to
the
direction
of
the
standing
committees
the
president
nominates
and
with
legislative
approval
appoints
to
the
more
important
offices
of
the
government
and
the
members
of
the
cabinet
have
the
privilege
of
advising
him
as
to
matters
in
most
of
which
he
has
no
power
of
final
action
without
the
concurrence
of
the
senate
but
the
gist
of
all
policy
is
decided
by
legislative
not
by
executive
will
it
can
be
no
great
satisfaction
to
any
man
to
possess
the
barren
privilege
of
suggesting
the
best
means
of
managing
the
routine
business
of
the
several
bureaux
so
long
as
the
larger
plans
which
that
business
is
meant
to
advance
are
made
for
him
by
others
who
are
set
over
him
if
one
is
commanded
to
go
to
this
place
or
to
that
place
and
must
go
will
he
nill
he
it
can
be
but
small
solace
to
him
that
he
is
left
free
to
determine
whether
he
will
ride
or
walk
in
going
the
journey
the
only
serious
questions
are
whether
or
not
this
so
great
and
real
control
exerted
by
congress
can
be
exercised
efficiently
and
with
sufficient
responsibility
to
those
whom
congress
represents
and
whether
good
government
is
promoted
by
the
arrangement
no
one
i
take
it
for
granted
is
disposed
to
disallow
the
principle
that
the
representatives
of
the
people
are
the
proper
ultimate
authority
in
all
matters
of
government
and
that
administration
is
merely
the
clerical
part
of
government
legislation
is
the
originating
force
it
determines
what
shall
be
done
and
the
president
if
he
can
not
or
will
not
stay
legislation
by
the
use
of
his
extraordinary
power
as
a
branch
of
the
legislature
is
plainly
bound
in
duty
to
render
unquestioning
obedience
to
congress
and
if
it
be
his
duty
to
obey
still
more
is
obedience
the
bounden
duty
of
his
subordinates
the
power
of
making
laws
is
in
its
very
nature
and
essence
the
power
of
directing
and
that
power
is
given
to
congress
the
principle
is
without
drawback
and
is
inseparably
of
a
piece
with
all
usage
the
difficulty
if
there
be
any
must
lie
in
the
choice
of
means
whereby
to
energize
the
principle
the
natural
means
would
seem
to
be
the
right
on
the
part
of
the
representative
body
to
have
all
the
executive
servants
of
its
will
under
its
close
and
constant
supervision
and
to
hold
them
to
a
strict
accountability
in
other
words
to
have
the
privilege
of
dismissing
them
whenever
their
service
became
unsatisfactory
this
is
the
privilege
of
every
other
master
and
if
congress
does
not
possess
it
its
mastery
is
hampered
without
being
denied
the
executive
officials
are
its
servants
all
the
same
the
only
difference
is
that
if
they
prove
negligent
or
incapable
or
deceitful
servants
congress
must
rest
content
with
the
best
that
can
be
got
out
of
them
until
its
chief
administrative
agent
the
president
chooses
to
appoint
better
it
can
not
make
them
docile
though
it
may
compel
them
to
be
obedient
in
all
greater
matters
in
authority
of
rule
congress
is
made
master
but
in
means
of
rule
it
is
made
mere
magistrate
it
commands
with
absolute
lordship
but
it
can
discipline
for
disobedience
only
by
slow
and
formal
judicial
process
upon
machiavelli
declaration
that
nothing
is
more
important
to
the
stability
of
the
state
than
that
facility
should
be
given
by
its
constitution
for
the
accusation
of
those
who
are
supposed
to
have
committed
any
public
wrong
a
writer
in
the
westminster
review
makes
this
thoughtful
comment
the
benefit
of
such
a
provision
is
twofold
first
the
salutary
fear
of
the
probable
coming
of
a
day
of
account
will
restrain
the
evil
practices
of
some
bad
men
and
secondly
the
legal
outlet
of
accusation
gives
vent
to
peccant
humors
in
the
body
politic
which
if
checked
and
driven
inward
would
work
to
the
utter
ruin
of
the
constitution
the
distinction
is
lost
between
accusation
and
calumny
and
of
course
it
was
these
benefits
which
our
federal
constitution
was
meant
to
secure
by
means
of
its
machinery
of
impeachment
no
servant
of
the
state
not
even
the
president
himself
was
to
be
beyond
the
reach
of
accusation
by
the
house
of
representatives
and
of
trial
by
the
senate
but
the
processes
of
impeachment
like
those
of
amendment
are
ponderous
and
difficult
to
handle
it
requires
something
like
passion
to
set
them
and
nothing
short
of
the
grossest
offenses
against
the
plain
law
of
the
land
will
suffice
to
give
them
speed
and
effectiveness
indignation
so
great
as
to
overcrow
party
interest
may
secure
a
conviction
nothing
less
can
indeed
judging
by
our
past
experiences
impeachment
may
be
said
to
be
little
more
than
an
empty
menace
the
house
of
representatives
is
a
tardy
grand
jury
and
the
senate
an
uncertain
court
besides
great
crimes
such
as
might
speed
even
impeachment
are
not
ordinary
things
in
the
loosest
public
service
an
public
opinion
can
generally
give
them
effective
check
that
which
usually
and
every
day
clogs
and
hampers
good
government
is
folly
or
incapacity
on
the
part
of
the
ministers
of
state
even
more
necessary
therefore
than
a
power
clothed
with
authority
to
accuse
try
and
punish
for
public
crime
is
some
ultimate
authority
whose
privilege
it
shall
be
to
dismiss
for
inefficiency
impeachment
is
aimed
altogether
above
the
head
of
business
management
a
merchant
would
not
think
it
fair
even
if
it
were
lawful
to
shoot
a
clerk
who
could
not
learn
the
business
dismissal
is
quite
as
effective
for
his
purposes
and
more
merciful
to
the
clerk
the
crying
inconvenience
of
our
system
is
therefore
that
the
constitutional
authority
whose
prerogative
it
is
to
direct
policy
and
oversee
administration
has
fewer
facilities
for
getting
its
work
well
done
than
has
the
humblest
citizen
for
obtaining
satisfactory
aid
in
his
own
undertakings
the
authority
most
interested
in
appointments
and
dismissals
in
the
civil
service
has
little
to
do
with
the
one
and
less
to
do
with
the
other
the
president
appoints
with
the
sanction
of
the
senate
and
can
not
dismiss
his
advisers
without
legislative
consent
yet
the
ministers
in
reality
serve
not
the
president
but
congress
and
congress
can
neither
appoint
nor
dismiss
in
other
words
the
president
must
in
both
acts
take
the
initiative
though
he
is
not
the
real
master
and
congress
which
is
the
real
master
has
in
these
vital
matters
only
a
consultative
voice
which
it
may
utter
through
its
upper
chamber
only
when
its
opinion
is
asked
i
should
regard
my
business
as
a
hopeless
undertaking
if
my
chief
agent
had
to
be
appointed
by
a
third
party
and
besides
being
himself
put
beyond
my
power
of
control
were
charged
with
the
choice
and
discipline
of
all
his
subordinates
subject
not
to
my
directions
but
simply
to
my
acquiescence
the
relations
existing
between
congress
and
the
departments
must
be
fatally
demoralizing
to
both
there
is
and
can
be
between
them
nothing
like
confidential
and
thorough
coöperation
the
departments
may
be
excused
for
that
attitude
of
hostility
which
they
sometimes
assume
towards
congress
because
it
is
quite
human
for
the
servant
to
fear
and
deceive
the
master
whom
he
does
not
regard
as
his
friend
but
suspects
of
being
a
distrustful
spy
of
his
movements
congress
can
not
control
the
officers
of
the
executive
without
disgracing
them
its
only
whip
is
investigation
examination
into
corners
suspected
to
be
dirty
it
must
draw
the
public
eye
by
openly
avowing
a
suspicion
of
malfeasance
and
must
then
magnify
and
intensify
the
scandal
by
setting
its
committees
to
scared
subordinates
and
sulky
ministers
and
after
all
is
over
and
the
murder
out
probably
nothing
is
done
the
offenders
if
any
one
has
offended
often
remain
in
office
shamed
before
the
world
and
ruined
in
the
estimation
of
all
honest
people
but
still
drawing
their
salaries
and
comfortably
waiting
for
the
short
memory
of
the
public
mind
to
forget
them
why
unearth
the
carcass
if
you
can
not
remove
it
then
too
the
departments
frequently
complain
of
the
incessant
exactions
made
upon
them
by
congress
they
grumble
that
they
are
kept
busy
in
satisfying
its
curiosity
and
in
meeting
the
demands
of
its
uneasy
activity
the
clerks
have
ordinarily
as
much
as
they
can
do
in
keeping
afoot
the
usual
routine
business
of
their
departments
but
congress
is
continually
calling
upon
them
for
information
which
must
be
laboriously
collected
from
all
sorts
of
sources
remote
and
accessible
a
great
speech
in
the
senate
may
cost
them
hours
of
anxious
toil
for
the
senator
who
makes
it
is
quite
likely
beforehand
to
introduce
a
resolution
calling
upon
one
of
the
secretaries
for

more
surely
than

is

unhesitatingly
ready
with
an
easy
assent
to
the
resolution
which
puts
the
whole
clerical
force
of
the
administration
at
his
service
and
of
course
the
house
too
asks
innumerable
questions
which
patient
clerks
and
protesting
secretaries
must
answer
to
the
last
and
most
minute
particular
this
is
what
the
departmental
officials
testily
call
the
tyranny
of
congress
and
no
impartial
third
person
can
reasonably
forbid
them
the
use
of
the
word
i
know
of
few
things
harder
to
state
clearly
and
within
reasonable
compass
than
just
how
the
nation
keeps
control
of
policy
in
spite
of
these
vagaries
of
authority
indeed
it
is
doubtful
if
it
does
keep
control
through
all
the
roundabout
paths
which
legislative
and
executive
responsibility
are
permitted
to
take
it
must
follow
congress
somewhat
blindly
congress
is
known
to
obey
without
altogether
understanding
its
committees
and
the
committees
must
consign
the
execution
of
their
plans
to
officials
who
have
opportunities
not
a
few
to
hoodwink
them
at
the
end
of
these
blind
processes
is
it
probable
that
the
ultimate
authority
the
people
is
quite
clear
in
its
mind
as
to
what
has
been
done
or
what
may
be
done
another
time
take
for
example
financial
policy
a
very
fair
example
because
as
i
have
shown
the
legislative
stages
of
financial
policy
are
more
talked
about
than
any
other
congressional
business
though
for
that
reason
an
extreme
example
if
after
appropriations
and
adjustments
of
taxation
have
been
tardily
and
in
much
tribulation
of
scheming
and
argument
agreed
upon
by
the
house
the
imperative
suggestions
and
stubborn
insistence
of
the
senate
confuse
matters
till
hardly
the
conference
committees
themselves
know
clearly
what
the
outcome
of
the
disagreements
has
been
and
if
when
these
compromise
measures
are
launched
as
laws
the
method
of
their
execution
is
beyond
the
view
of
the
houses
in
the
of
the
departments
how
is
the
comprehension
not
to
speak
of
the
will
of
the
people
to
keep
any
sort
of
hold
upon
the
course
of
affairs
there
are
no
screws
of
responsibility
which
they
can
turn
upon
the
consciences
or
upon
the
official
thumbs
of
the
congressional
committees
principally
concerned
congressional
committees
are
nothing
to
the
nation
they
are
only
pieces
of
the
interior
mechanism
of
congress
to
congress
they
stand
or
fall
and
since
congress
itself
can
scarcely
be
sure
of
having
its
own
way
with
them
the
constituencies
are
manifestly
unlikely
to
be
able
to
govern
them
as
for
the
departments
the
people
can
hardly
do
more
in
drilling
them
to
unquestioning
obedience
and
docile
efficiency
than
congress
can
congress
is
and
must
be
in
these
matters
the
nation
eyes
and
voice
if
it
can
not
see
what
goes
wrong
and
can
not
get
itself
heeded
when
it
commands
the
nation
likewise
is
both
blind
and
dumb
this
plainly
put
is
the
practical
result
of
the
piecing
of
authority
the
cutting
of
it
up
into
small
bits
which
is
contrived
in
our
constitutional
system
each
branch
of
the
government
is
fitted
out
with
a
small
section
of
responsibility
whose
limited
opportunities
afford
to
the
conscience
of
each
many
easy
escapes
every
suspected
culprit
may
shift
the
responsibility
upon
his
fellows
is
congress
rated
for
corrupt
or
imperfect
or
foolish
legislation
it
may
urge
that
it
has
to
follow
hastily
its
committees
or
do
nothing
at
all
but
talk
how
can
it
help
it
if
a
stupid
committee
leads
it
unawares
into
unjust
or
fatuous
enterprises
does
administration
blunder
and
run
itself
into
all
sorts
of
straits
the
secretaries
hasten
to
plead
the
unreasonable
or
unwise
commands
of
congress
and
congress
falls
to
blaming
the
secretaries
the
secretaries
aver
that
the
whole
mischief
might
have
been
avoided
if
they
had
only
been
allowed
to
suggest
the
proper
measures
and
the
men
who
framed
the
existing
measures
in
their
turn
avow
their
despair
of
good
government
so
long
as
they
must
intrust
all
their
plans
to
the
bungling
incompetence
of
men
who
are
appointed
by
and
responsible
to
somebody
else
how
is
the
schoolmaster
the
nation
to
know
which
boy
needs
the
whipping
moreover
it
is
impossible
to
deny
that
this
division
of
authority
and
concealment
of
responsibility
are
calculated
to
subject
the
government
to
a
very
distressing
paralysis
in
moments
of
emergency
there
are
few
if
any
important
steps
that
can
be
taken
by
any
one
branch
of
the
government
without
the
consent
or
coöperation
of
some
other
branch
congress
must
act
through
the
president
and
his
cabinet
the
president
and
his
cabinet
must
wait
upon
the
will
of
congress
there
is
no
one
supreme
ultimate
head
whether
magistrate
or
representative
body
which
can
decide
at
once
and
with
conclusive
authority
what
shall
be
done
at
those
times
when
some
decision
there
must
be
and
that
immediately
of
course
this
lack
is
of
a
sort
to
be
felt
at
all
times
in
seasons
of
tranquil
rounds
of
business
as
well
as
at
moments
of
sharp
crisis
but
in
times
of
sudden
exigency
it
might
prove
fatal
fatal
either
in
breaking
down
the
system
or
in
failing
to
meet
the
emergency
policy
can
not
be
either
prompt
or
straightforward
when
it
must
serve
many
masters
it
must
either
equivocate
or
hesitate
or
fail
altogether
it
may
set
out
with
clear
purpose
from
congress
but
get
waylaid
or
maimed
by
the
executive
if
there
be
one
principle
clearer
than
another
it
is
this
that
in
any
business
whether
of
government
or
of
mere
merchandising
must
be
in
order
that
when
things
go
wrong
it
may
be
quite
plain
who
should
be
punished
in
order
to
drive
trade
at
the
speed
and
with
the
success
you
desire
you
must
confide
without
suspicion
in
your
chief
clerk
giving
him
the
power
to
ruin
you
because
you
thereby
furnish
him
with
a
motive
for
serving
you
his
reputation
his
own
honor
or
disgrace
all
his
own
commercial
prospects
hang
upon
your
success
and
human
nature
is
much
the
same
in
government
as
in
the
trade
and
strict
accountability
for
its
are
the
essential
constituents
of
good
government
a
sense
of
highest
responsibility
a
dignifying
and
elevating
sense
of
being
trusted
together
with
a
consciousness
of
being
in
an
official
station
so
conspicuous
that
no
faithful
discharge
of
duty
can
go
unacknowledged
and
unrewarded
and
no
breach
of
trust
undiscovered
and
unpunished
these
are
the
influences
the
only
influences
which
foster
practical
energetic
and
trustworthy
statesmanship
the
best
rulers
are
always
those
to
whom
great
power
is
intrusted
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
them
feel
that
they
will
surely
be
abundantly
honored
and
recompensed
for
a
just
and
patriotic
use
of
it
and
to
make
them
know
that
nothing
can
shield
them
from
full
retribution
for
every
abuse
of
it
it
is
therefore
manifestly
a
radical
defect
in
our
federal
system
that
it
parcels
out
power
and
confuses
responsibility
as
it
does
the
main
purpose
of
the
convention
of
seems
to
have
been
to
accomplish
this
grievous
mistake
the
literary
theory
of
checks
and
balances
is
simply
a
consistent
account
of
what
our
tried
to
do
and
those
checks
and
balances
have
proved
mischievous
just
to
the
extent
to
which
they
have
succeeded
in
establishing
themselves
as
realities
it
is
quite
safe
to
say
that
were
it
possible
to
call
together
again
the
members
of
that
wonderful
convention
to
view
the
work
of
their
hands
in
the
light
of
the
century
that
has
tested
it
they
would
be
the
first
to
admit
that
the
only
fruit
of
dividing
power
had
been
to
make
it
irresponsible
it
is
just
this
that
has
made
civil
service
reform
tarry
in
this
country
and
that
makes
it
still
almost
doubtful
of
issue
we
are
in
just
the
case
that
england
was
in
before
she
achieved
the
reform
for
which
we
are
striving
the
date
of
the
reform
in
england
is
no
less
significant
than
the
fact
it
was
not
accomplished
until
a
distinct
responsibility
of
the
ministers
of
the
crown
to
one
and
to
only
one
master
had
been
established
beyond
all
uncertainty
this
is
the
most
striking
and
suggestive
lesson
to
be
gathered
from
eaton
interesting
and
valuable
history
of
civil
service
in
great
britain
the
reform
was
originated
in
by
the
cabinet
of
lord
aberdeen
it
sprang
from
the
suggestion
of
the
appointing
officers
and
was
carried
through
in
the
face
of
opposition
from
the
house
of
commons
because
paradoxically
enough
the
ministry
had
at
last
come
to
feel
their
responsibility
to
the
commons
or
rather
to
the
nation
whom
the
commons
represented
those
great
improvements
which
have
been
made
in
the
public
service
of
the
british
empire
since
the
days
of
walpole
and
newcastle
have
gone
hand
in
hand
with
the
perfecting
of
the
system
now
known
as
responsible
cabinet
government
that
system
was
slow
in
coming
to
perfection
it
was
not
till
long
after
walpole
day
that
unity
of
responsibility
on
the
part
of
the
cabinet
and
that
singleness
of
responsibility
which
made
them
look
only
to
the
commons
for
authority
came
to
be
recognized
as
an
established
constitutional
principle
as
a
consequence
of
the
earlier
practice
of
constructing
cabinets
of
men
of
different
political
views
it
followed
that
the
members
of
such
cabinets
did
not
and
could
not
regard
their
responsibility
to
parliament
as
one
and
indivisible
the
resignation
of
an
important
member
or
even
of
the
prime
minister
was
not
regarded
as
necessitating
the
simultaneous
retirement
of
his
colleagues
even
so
late
as
the
fall
of
sir
robert
walpole
fifty
years
after
the
revolution
settlement
and
itself
the
first
instance
of
resignation
in
deference
to
a
hostile
parliamentary
vote
we
find
the
king
requesting
walpole
successor
pulteney
to
distress
the
government
by
making
too
many
changes
in
the
midst
of
a
session
and
pulteney
replying
that
he
would
be
satisfied
provided
main
forts
of
the
government
or
in
other
words
the
principal
offices
of
state
were
placed
in
his
hands
it
was
not
till
the
displacement
of
lord
north
ministry
by
that
of
lord
rockingham
in
that
a
whole
administration
with
the
exception
of
the
lord
chancellor
was
changed
by
a
vote
of
want
of
confidence
passed
in
the
house
of
commons
thenceforth
however
the
resignation
of
the
head
of
a
government
in
deference
to
an
adverse
vote
of
the
popular
chamber
has
invariably
been
accompanied
by
the
resignation
of
all
his
colleagues
but
even
after
the
establishment
of
that
precedent
it
was
still
many
years
before
cabinets
were
free
to
please
none
but
the
commons
free
to
follow
their
own
policies
without
authoritative
suggestion
from
the
sovereign
until
the
death
of
the
fourth
george
they
were
made
to
feel
that
they
owed
a
double
allegiance
to
the
commons
and
to
the
king
the
composition
of
ministries
still
depended
largely
on
the
royal
whim
and
their
actions
were
hampered
by
the
necessity
of
steering
a
careful
middle
course
between
the
displeasure
of
parliament
and
the
of
his
majesty
the
present
century
had
run
far
on
towards
the
reign
of
victoria
before
they
were
free
to
pay
undivided
obedience
to
the
representatives
of
the
people
when
once
they
had
become
responsible
to
the
commons
alone
however
and
almost
as
soon
as
they
were
assured
of
their
new
position
as
the
servants
of
the
nation
they
were
prompted
to
even
hazardous
efforts
for
the
reform
of
the
civil
service
they
were
conscious
that
the
entire
weight
and
responsibility
of
government
rested
upon
their
shoulders
and
as
men
regardful
of
the
interests
of
the
party
which
they
represented
jealous
for
the
preservation
of
their
own
fair
names
and
anxious
consequently
for
the
promotion
of
wise
rule
they
were
naturally
and
of
course
the
first
to
advocate
a
better
system
of
appointment
to
that
service
whose
chiefs
they
were
recognized
to
be
they
were
prompt
to
declare
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
executive
to
provide
for
the
efficient
and
harmonious
working
of
the
civil
service
and
that
they
could
not
transfer
that
duty
to
any
other
body
far
less
competent
than
themselves
without
infringing
a
great
and
important
constitutional
principle
already
too
often
infringed
to
the
great
detriment
of
the
public
service
they
therefore
determined
themselves
to
inaugurate
the
without
waiting
for
the
assent
of
parliament
by
simply
surrendering
their
power
of
appointment
in
the
various
departments
to
a
examining
board
trusting
to
the
power
of
public
opinion
to
induce
parliament
after
the
thing
had
been
done
to
vote
sufficient
money
to
put
the
scheme
into
successful
operation
and
they
did
not
reckon
without
their
host
reluctant
as
the
members
of
the
house
of
commons
were
to
resign
that
control
of
the
national
patronage
which
they
had
from
time
immemorial
been
accustomed
to
exercise
by
means
of
various
crooked
indirections
and
which
it
had
been
their
pleasure
and
their
power
to
possess
they
had
not
the
face
to
avow
their
suspicious
unwillingness
in
answer
to
the
honorable
call
of
a
trusted
ministry
who
were
supported
in
their
demand
by
all
that
was
honest
in
public
sentiment
and
the
world
was
afforded
the
gratifying
but
unwonted
spectacle
of
party
leaders
sacrificing
to
the
cause
of
good
government
freely
and
altogether
of
their
own
accord
the
spoils
of
office
so
long
dear
to
the
party
and
to
the
assembly
which
they
represented
and
served
in
this
country
the
course
of
the
reform
was
quite
the
reverse
neither
the
executive
nor
congress
began
it
the
call
for
it
came
imperatively
from
the
people
it
was
a
formulated
demand
of
public
opinion
made
upon
congress
and
it
had
to
be
made
again
and
again
each
time
with
more
determined
emphasis
before
congress
heeded
it
worked
its
way
up
from
the
convictions
of
the
many
to
the
purposes
of
the
few
amongst
the
chief
difficulties
that
have
stood
in
its
way
and
which
still
block
its
perfect
realization
is
that
peculiarity
of
structure
which
i
have
just
now
pointed
out
as
intrinsic
in
the
scheme
of
divided
power
which
runs
through
the
constitution
one
of
the
conditions
precedent
to
any
real
and
lasting
reform
of
the
civil
service
in
a
country
whose
public
service
is
moulded
by
the
conditions
of
is
the
drawing
of
a
sharp
line
of
distinction
between
those
offices
which
are
political
and
those
which
are
the
strictest
rules
of
business
discipline
of
and
earned
promotion
must
rule
every
office
whose
incumbent
has
naught
to
do
with
choosing
between
policies
but
no
rules
except
the
choice
of
parties
can
or
should
make
and
unmake
reward
or
punish
those
officers
whose
privilege
it
is
to
fix
upon
the
political
purposes
which
administration
shall
be
made
to
serve
these
latter
are
not
many
under
any
form
of
government
there
are
said
to
be
but
fifty
such
at
most
in
the
civil
service
of
great
britain
but
these
fifty
go
in
or
out
as
the
balance
of
power
shifts
from
party
to
party
in
the
case
of
our
own
civil
service
it
would
i
take
it
be
extremely
hard
to
determine
where
the
line
should
be
drawn
in
all
the
higher
grades
this
particular
distinction
is
quite
obscured
a
doubt
exists
as
to
the
cabinet
itself
are
the
secretaries
political
or
officers
it
would
seem
that
they
are
exclusively
neither
they
are
at
least
they
are
on
the
one
hand
merely
the
servants
of
congress
and
yet
on
the
other
hand
they
have
enough
freedom
of
discretion
to
mar
and
color
if
not
to
choose
political
ends
they
can
wreck
plans
if
they
can
not
make
them
should
they
be
made
permanent
officials
because
they
are
mere
secretaries
or
should
their
tenure
depend
upon
the
fortunes
of
parties
because
they
have
many
chances
to
render
party
services
and
if
the
one
rule
or
the
other
is
to
be
applied
to
them
to
how
many
and
to
which
of
their
chief
subordinates
is
it
to
be
extended
if
they
are
not
properly
or
necessarily
party
men
let
them
pass
the
examinations
and
run
the
gauntlet
of
the
usual
tests
of
efficiency
let
work
up
to
but
if
not
let
their
responsibility
to
their
party
be
made
strict
and
determinate
that
is
the
cardinal
point
of
practical
civil
service
reform
this
doubt
as
to
the
exact
in
the
system
of
the
chief
ministers
of
state
is
a
most
striking
commentary
on
the
system
itself
its
complete
self
is
logical
and
simple
but
its
complete
self
exists
only
in
theory
its
real
self
offers
a
surprise
and
presents
a
mystery
at
every
change
of
view
the
practical
observer
who
seeks
for
facts
and
actual
conditions
of
organization
is
often
sorely
puzzled
to
come
at
the
real
methods
of
government
pitfalls
await
him
on
every
side
if
constitutional
lawyers
of
consciences
filled
congress
and
officered
the
departments
every
clause
of
the
constitution
would
be
accorded
a
formal
obedience
and
it
would
be
as
easy
to
know
beforehand
just
what
the
government
will
be
like
inside
as
it
is
now
to
know
what
it
was
like
outside
yesterday
but
neither
the
knowledge
nor
the
consciences
of
politicians
keep
them
very
close
to
the
constitution
and
it
is
with
politicians
that
we
have
to
deal
nowadays
in
studying
the
government
every
government
is
largely
what
the
men
are
who
constitute
it
if
the
character
or
opinions
of
legislators
and
administrators
change
from
time
to
time
the
nature
of
the
government
changes
with
them
and
as
both
their
characters
and
their
opinions
do
change
very
often
it
is
very
hard
to
make
a
picture
of
the
government
which
can
be
said
to
have
been
perfectly
faithful
yesterday
and
can
be
confidently
expected
to
be
exactly
accurate
add
to
these
embarrassments
which
may
be
called
the
embarrassments
of
human
nature
other
embarrassments
such
as
our
system
affords
the
embarrassments
of
subtle
legal
distinctions
a
fine
theoretical
plan
made
in
delicate
requirements
of
law
which
can
hardly
be
met
and
can
easily
and
naturally
be
evaded
or
disregarded
and
you
have
in
full
the
conception
of
the
difficulties
which
attend
a
practical
exposition
of
the
real
facts
of
federal
administration
it
is
not
impossible
to
point
out
what
the
executive
was
intended
to
be
what
it
has
sometimes
been
or
what
it
might
be
nor
is
it
forbidden
the
diligent
to
discover
the
main
conditions
which
mould
it
to
the
forms
of
congressional
supremacy
but
more
than
this
is
not
to
be
expected
vi
conclusion
political
philosophy
must
analyze
political
history
it
must
distinguish
what
is
due
to
the
excellence
of
the
people
and
what
to
the
excellence
of
the
laws
it
must
carefully
calculate
the
exact
effect
of
each
part
of
the
constitution
though
thus
it
may
destroy
many
an
idol
of
the
multitude
and
detect
the
secret
of
utility
where
but
few
imagined
it
to
bagehot
congress
always
makes
what
haste
it
can
to
legislate
it
is
the
prime
object
of
its
rules
to
expedite
its
customs
are
fruits
of
its
characteristic
diligence
in
enactment
be
the
matters
small
or
great
frivolous
or
grave
which
busy
it
its
aim
is
to
have
laws
always
its
temper
is
strenuously
legislative
that
it
can
not
regulate
all
the
questions
to
which
its
attention
is
weekly
invited
is
its
misfortune
not
its
fault
is
due
to
the
human
limitation
of
its
faculties
not
to
any
narrow
circumscription
of
its
desires
if
its
committee
machinery
is
inadequate
to
the
task
of
bringing
to
action
more
than
one
out
of
every
hundred
of
the
bills
introduced
it
is
not
because
the
quick
clearance
of
the
docket
is
not
the
motive
of
its
organic
life
if
legislation
therefore
were
the
only
or
the
chief
object
for
which
it
should
live
it
would
not
be
possible
to
withhold
admiration
from
those
clever
hurrying
rules
and
those
inexorable
customs
which
seek
to
facilitate
it
nothing
but
a
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
congress
should
confine
itself
to
can
challenge
with
a
question
the
utility
of
its
organization
as
a
facile
machine
the
political
philosopher
of
these
days
of
has
however
something
more
than
a
doubt
with
which
to
gainsay
the
usefulness
of
a
sovereign
representative
body
which
confines
itself
to
legislation
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
functions
buckle
declared
indeed
that
the
chief
use
and
value
of
legislation
nowadays
lay
in
its
opportunity
and
power
to
remedy
the
mistakes
of
the
legislation
of
the
past
that
it
was
beneficent
only
when
it
carried
healing
in
its
wings
that
repeal
was
more
blessed
than
enactment
and
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
greater
part
of
the
labor
of
legislation
consists
in
carrying
the
loads
recklessly
or
bravely
shouldered
in
times
gone
by
when
the
animal
which
is
now
a
bull
was
only
a
calf
and
in
completing
if
they
may
be
completed
the
tasks
once
undertaken
in
the
shape
of
unambitious
schemes
which
at
the
outset
looked
innocent
enough
having
got
his
foot
into
it
the
legislator
finds
it
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
get
it
out
again
the
modern
industrial
organization
including
banks
corporations
companies
financial
devices
national
debts
paper
currency
national
systems
of
taxation
is
largely
the
creation
of
legislation
not
in
its
historical
origin
but
in
the
mode
of
its
existence
and
in
its
authority
and
is
largely
regulated
by
legislation
capital
is
the
breath
of
life
to
this
organization
and
every
day
as
the
organization
becomes
more
complex
and
delicate
the
folly
of
assailing
capital
or
credit
becomes
greater
at
the
same
time
it
is
evident
that
the
task
of
the
legislator
to
embrace
in
his
view
the
whole
system
to
adjust
his
rules
so
that
the
play
of
the
civil
institutions
shall
not
alter
the
play
of
the
economic
forces
requires
more
training
and
more
acumen
furthermore
the
greater
the
complication
and
delicacy
of
the
industrial
system
the
greater
the
chances
for
cupidity
when
backed
by
craft
and
the
task
of
the
legislator
to
meet
and
defeat
the
attempts
of
this
cupidity
is
one
of
constantly
increasing
difficulty
legislation
unquestionably
generates
legislation
every
statute
may
be
said
to
have
a
long
lineage
of
statutes
behind
it
and
whether
that
lineage
be
honorable
or
of
ill
repute
is
as
much
a
question
as
to
each
individual
statute
as
it
can
be
with
regard
to
the
ancestry
of
each
individual
legislator
every
statute
in
its
turn
has
a
numerous
progeny
and
only
time
and
opportunity
can
decide
whether
its
offspring
will
bring
it
honor
or
shame
once
begin
the
dance
of
legislation
and
you
must
struggle
through
its
mazes
as
best
you
can
to
its
breathless
end
if
any
end
there
be
it
is
not
surprising
therefore
that
the
enacting
revising
tinkering
repealing
of
laws
should
engross
the
attention
and
engage
the
entire
energy
of
such
a
body
as
congress
it
is
however
easy
to
see
how
it
might
be
better
employed
or
at
least
how
it
might
add
others
to
this
overshadowing
function
to
the
infinite
advantage
of
the
government
quite
as
important
as
legislation
is
vigilant
oversight
of
administration
and
even
more
important
than
legislation
is
the
instruction
and
guidance
in
political
affairs
which
the
people
might
receive
from
a
body
which
kept
all
national
concerns
suffused
in
a
broad
daylight
of
discussion
there
is
no
similar
legislature
in
existence
which
is
so
shut
up
to
the
one
business
of
as
is
our
congress
as
i
have
said
it
in
a
way
superintends
administration
by
the
exercise
of
powers
of
investigation
whose
limitations
and
insufficiency
are
manifest
but
other
national
legislatures
command
administration
and
verify
their
name
of
parliaments
by
talking
official
acts
into
notoriety
our
party
conventions
and
poor
in
power
as
they
are
constitute
our
only
machinery
for
that
sort
of
control
of
the
executive
which
consists
in
the
award
of
personal
rewards
and
punishments
this
is
the
cardinal
fact
which
differentiates
congress
from
the
chamber
of
deputies
and
from
parliament
and
which
puts
it
beyond
the
reach
of
those
eminently
useful
functions
whose
exercise
would
so
raise
it
in
usefulness
and
in
dignity
an
effective
representative
body
gifted
with
the
power
to
rule
ought
it
would
seem
not
only
to
speak
the
will
of
the
nation
which
congress
does
but
also
to
lead
it
to
its
conclusions
to
utter
the
voice
of
its
opinions
and
to
serve
as
its
eyes
in
superintending
all
matters
of
government
which
congress
does
not
do
the
discussions
which
take
place
in
congress
are
aimed
at
random
they
now
and
again
strike
rather
sharply
the
tender
spots
in
this
that
or
the
other
measure
but
as
i
have
said
no
two
measures
consciously
join
in
purpose
or
agree
in
character
and
so
debate
must
wander
as
widely
as
the
subjects
of
debate
since
there
is
little
coherency
about
the
legislation
agreed
upon
there
can
be
little
coherency
about
the
debates
there
is
no
one
policy
to
be
attacked
or
defended
but
only
a
score
or
two
of
separate
bills
to
attend
to
such
discussions
is
uninteresting
to
be
instructed
by
them
is
impossible
there
is
some
scandal
and
discomfort
but
infinite
advantage
in
having
every
affair
of
administration
subjected
to
the
test
of
constant
examination
on
the
part
of
the
assembly
which
represents
the
nation
the
chief
use
of
such
inquisition
is
not
the
direction
of
those
affairs
in
a
way
with
which
the
country
will
be
satisfied
though
that
itself
is
of
course
but
the
enlightenment
of
the
people
which
is
always
its
sure
consequence
very
few
men
are
unequal
to
a
danger
which
they
see
and
understand
all
men
quail
before
a
threatening
which
is
dark
and
unintelligible
and
suspect
what
is
done
behind
a
screen
if
the
people
could
have
through
congress
daily
knowledge
of
all
the
more
important
transactions
of
the
governmental
offices
an
insight
into
all
that
now
seems
withheld
and
private
their
confidence
in
the
executive
now
so
often
shaken
would
i
think
be
very
soon
established
because
dishonesty
can
lurk
under
the
privacies
now
vouchsafed
our
administrative
agents
much
that
is
upright
and
pure
suffers
unjust
suspicion
discoveries
of
guilt
in
a
bureau
cloud
with
doubts
the
trustworthiness
of
a
department
as
nothing
is
open
enough
for
the
quick
and
easy
detection
of
peculation
or
fraud
so
nothing
is
open
enough
for
the
due
vindication
and
acknowledgment
of
honesty
the
isolation
and
privacy
which
shield
the
one
from
discovery
cheat
the
other
of
reward
inquisitiveness
is
never
so
forward
enterprising
and
irrepressible
as
in
a
popular
assembly
which
is
given
leave
to
ask
questions
and
is
afforded
ready
and
abundant
means
of
getting
its
questions
answered
no
is
more
searching
than
that
to
which
a
minister
of
the
crown
is
subjected
by
the
commons
sir
robert
peel
once
asked
to
have
a
number
of
questions
carefully
written
down
which
they
asked
him
one
day
in
succession
in
the
house
of
commons
they
seemed
a
list
of
everything
that
could
occur
in
the
british
empire
or
to
the
brain
of
a
member
of
parliament
if
one
considered
only
the
wear
and
tear
upon
ministers
of
state
which
the
plague
of
constant
interrogation
must
inflict
he
could
wish
that
their
lives
if
useful
might
be
spared
this
blight
of
unending
explanation
but
no
one
can
overestimate
the
immense
advantage
of
a
facility
so
unlimited
for
knowing
all
that
is
going
on
in
the
places
where
authority
lives
the
conscience
of
every
member
of
the
representative
body
is
at
the
service
of
the
nation
all
that
he
feels
bound
to
know
he
can
find
out
and
what
he
finds
out
goes
to
the
ears
of
the
country
the
question
is
his
the
answer
the
nation
and
the
inquisitiveness
of
such
bodies
as
congress
is
the
best
conceivable
source
of
information
congress
is
the
only
body
which
has
the
proper
motive
for
inquiry
and
it
is
the
only
body
which
has
the
power
to
act
effectively
upon
the
knowledge
which
its
inquiries
secure
the
press
is
merely
curious
or
merely
partisan
the
people
are
scattered
and
unorganized
but
congress
is
as
it
were
the
corporate
people
the
mouthpiece
of
its
will
it
is
a
sovereign
delegation
which
could
ask
questions
with
dignity
because
with
authority
and
with
power
to
act
congress
is
fast
becoming
the
governing
body
of
the
nation
and
yet
the
only
power
which
it
possesses
in
perfection
is
the
power
which
is
but
a
part
of
government
the
power
of
legislation
legislation
is
but
the
oil
of
government
it
is
that
which
lubricates
its
channels
and
speeds
its
wheels
that
which
lessens
the
friction
and
so
eases
the
movement
or
perhaps
i
shall
be
admitted
to
have
hit
upon
a
closer
and
apter
analogy
if
i
say
that
legislation
is
like
a
foreman
set
over
the
forces
of
government
it
issues
the
orders
which
others
obey
it
directs
it
admonishes
but
it
does
not
do
the
actual
heavy
work
of
governing
a
good
foreman
does
it
is
true
himself
take
a
hand
in
the
work
which
he
guides
and
so
i
suppose
our
legislation
must
be
likened
to
a
poor
foreman
because
it
stands
altogether
apart
from
that
work
which
it
is
set
to
see
well
done
members
of
congress
ought
not
to
be
censured
too
severely
however
when
they
fail
to
check
evil
courses
on
the
part
of
the
executive
they
have
been
denied
the
means
of
doing
so
promptly
and
with
effect
whatever
intention
may
have
controlled
the
compromises
of
in
their
result
was
to
give
us
not
government
by
discussion
which
is
the
only
tolerable
sort
of
government
for
a
people
which
tries
to
do
its
own
governing
but
only
by
discussion
which
is
no
more
than
a
small
part
of
government
by
discussion
what
is
quite
as
indispensable
as
the
debate
of
problems
of
legislation
is
the
debate
of
all
matters
of
administration
it
is
even
more
important
to
know
how
the
house
is
being
built
than
to
know
how
the
plans
of
the
architect
were
conceived
and
how
his
specifications
were
calculated
it
is
better
to
have
skillful
work
stout
walls
reliable
arches
unbending
rafters
and
windows
sure
to
expel
the
flaw
than
a
drawing
on
paper
which
is
the
admiration
of
all
the
practical
artists
in
the
country
the
discipline
of
an
army
depends
quite
as
much
upon
the
temper
of
the
troops
as
upon
the
orders
of
the
day
it
is
the
proper
duty
of
a
representative
body
to
look
diligently
into
every
affair
of
government
and
to
talk
much
about
what
it
sees
it
is
meant
to
be
the
eyes
and
the
voice
and
to
embody
the
wisdom
and
will
of
its
constituents
unless
congress
have
and
use
every
means
of
acquainting
itself
with
the
acts
and
the
disposition
of
the
administrative
agents
of
the
government
the
country
must
be
helpless
to
learn
how
it
is
being
served
and
unless
congress
both
scrutinize
these
things
and
sift
them
by
every
form
of
discussion
the
country
must
remain
in
embarrassing
crippling
ignorance
of
the
very
affairs
which
it
is
most
important
that
it
should
understand
and
direct
the
informing
function
of
congress
should
be
preferred
even
to
its
legislative
function
the
argument
is
not
only
that
discussed
and
interrogated
administration
is
the
only
pure
and
efficient
administration
but
more
than
that
that
the
only
really
people
is
that
people
which
discusses
and
interrogates
its
administration
the
talk
on
the
part
of
congress
which
we
sometimes
justly
condemn
is
the
profitless
squabble
of
words
over
frivolous
bills
or
selfish
party
issues
it
would
be
hard
to
conceive
of
there
being
too
much
talk
about
the
practical
concerns
and
processes
of
government
such
talk
it
is
which
when
earnestly
and
purposefully
conducted
clears
the
public
mind
and
shapes
the
demands
of
public
opinion
congress
could
not
be
too
diligent
about
such
talking
whereas
it
may
easily
be
too
diligent
in
legislation
it
often
overdoes
that
business
it
already
sends
to
its
committees
bills
too
many
by
the
thousand
to
be
given
even
a
hasty
thought
but
its
immense
committee
facilities
and
the
absence
of
all
other
duties
but
that
of
legislation
make
it
omnivorous
in
its
appetite
for
new
subjects
for
consideration
it
is
greedy
to
have
a
taste
of
every
possible
dish
that
may
be
put
upon
its
table
as
an
extra
to
the
constitutional
bill
of
fare
this
disposition
on
its
part
is
the
more
notable
because
there
is
certainly
less
need
for
it
to
hurry
and
overwork
itself
at
than
exists
in
the
case
of
most
other
great
national
legislatures
it
is
not
state
and
national
legislature
combined
as
are
the
commons
of
england
and
the
chambers
of
france
like
the
reichstag
of
our
cousin
germans
it
is
restricted
to
subjects
of
imperial
scope
its
thoughts
are
meant
to
be
kept
for
national
interests
its
time
is
spared
the
waste
of
attention
to
local
affairs
it
is
even
forbidden
the
vast
domain
of
the
laws
of
property
of
commercial
dealing
and
of
ordinary
crime
and
even
in
the
matter
of
caring
for
national
interests
the
way
has
from
the
first
been
made
plain
and
easy
for
it
there
are
no
clogging
feudal
institutions
to
embarrass
it
there
is
no
practice
of
legal
or
of
royal
tyranny
for
it
to
cure
no
clearing
away
of
old
débris
of
any
sort
to
delay
it
in
its
exercise
of
a
dominion
over
a
thoroughly
modern
and
progressive
nation
it
is
easy
to
believe
that
its
legislative
purposes
might
be
most
fortunately
clarified
and
simplified
were
it
to
square
them
by
a
conscientious
attention
to
the
paramount
and
controlling
duty
of
understanding
discussing
and
directing
administration
if
the
people
authorized
representatives
do
not
take
upon
themselves
this
duty
and
by
identifying
themselves
with
the
actual
work
of
government
stand
between
it
and
irresponsible
criticism
to
what
harassments
is
the
executive
not
exposed
led
and
checked
by
congress
the
prurient
and
fearless
because
anonymous
animadversions
of
the
press
now
so
often
premature
and
inconsiderate
might
be
disciplined
into
serviceable
capacity
to
interpret
and
judge
its
energy
and
sagacity
might
be
tempered
by
discretion
and
strengthened
by
knowledge
one
of
our
chief
constitutional
difficulties
is
that
in
opportunities
for
informing
and
guiding
public
opinion
the
freedom
of
the
press
is
greater
than
the
freedom
of
congress
it
is
as
if
newspapers
instead
of
the
board
of
directors
were
the
sources
of
information
for
the
stockholders
of
a
corporation
we
look
into
correspondents
letters
instead
of
into
the
congressional
record
to
find
out
what
is
and
in
the
departments
congress
is
altogether
excluded
from
the
arrangement
by
which
the
press
declares
what
the
executive
is
and
conventions
of
the
national
parties
decide
what
the
executive
shall
be
editors
are
our
guides
and
caucus
delegates
our
government
directors
since
all
this
curious
scattering
of
functions
and
contrivance
of
frail
machinery
of
government
is
the
result
of
that
entire
separation
of
the
legislative
and
executive
branches
of
the
system
which
is
with
us
so
characteristically
and
essentially
constitutional
it
is
exceedingly
interesting
to
inquire
and
important
to
understand
how
that
separation
came
to
be
insisted
upon
in
the
making
of
the
constitution
alexander
hamilton
has
in
our
own
times
as
well
as
before
been
severely
reproached
with
having
said
that
the
british
government
was
the
model
in
existence
in
this
was
a
mere
truism
however
much
the
men
of
that
day
differed
they
were
all
agreed
in
despising
and
distrusting
constitutions
and
ideally
perfect
governments
fresh
from
the
brains
of
visionary
enthusiasts
such
as
sprang
up
rankly
in
the
soil
of
the
french
revolution
the
convention
of
was
composed
of
very
able
men
of
the
race
they
took
the
system
of
government
with
which
they
had
been
familiar
improved
it
adapted
it
to
the
circumstances
with
which
they
had
to
deal
and
put
it
into
successful
operation
hamilton
plan
then
like
the
others
was
on
the
british
model
and
it
did
not
differ
essentially
in
details
from
that
finally
adopted
it
is
needful
however
to
remember
in
this
connection
what
has
already
been
alluded
to
that
when
that
convention
was
copying
the
english
constitution
that
constitution
was
in
a
stage
of
transition
and
had
by
no
means
fully
developed
the
features
which
are
now
recognized
as
most
characteristic
of
it
lodge
is
quite
right
in
saying
that
the
convention
in
adapting
improved
upon
the
english
constitution
with
which
its
members
were
familiar
the
constitution
of
george
iii
and
lord
north
the
constitution
which
had
failed
to
crush
bute
it
could
hardly
be
said
with
equal
confidence
however
that
our
system
as
then
made
was
an
improvement
upon
that
scheme
of
responsible
cabinet
government
which
challenges
the
admiration
of
the
world
though
it
was
quite
plainly
a
marked
advance
upon
a
parliament
of
royal
nominees
and
pensionaries
and
a
secret
cabinet
of
king
friends
the
english
constitution
of
that
day
had
a
great
many
features
which
did
not
invite
republican
imitation
it
was
suspected
if
not
known
that
the
ministers
who
sat
in
parliament
were
little
more
than
the
tools
of
a
ministry
of
royal
favorites
who
were
kept
out
of
sight
behind
the
strictest
confidences
of
the
court
it
was
notorious
that
the
subservient
parliaments
of
the
day
represented
the
estates
and
the
money
of
the
peers
and
the
influence
of
the
king
rather
than
the
intelligence
and
purpose
of
the
nation
the
whole
form
and
pressure
of
the
time
illustrated
only
too
forcibly
lord
bute
sinister
suggestion
that
the
forms
of
a
free
and
the
ends
of
an
arbitrary
government
are
things
not
altogether
incompatible
it
was
therefore
perfectly
natural
that
the
warnings
to
be
so
easily
drawn
from
the
sight
of
a
despotic
monarch
binding
the
usages
and
privileges
of
to
the
service
of
his
own
intemperate
purposes
should
be
given
grave
heed
by
americans
who
were
the
very
persons
who
had
suffered
most
from
the
existing
abuses
it
was
something
more
than
natural
that
the
convention
of
should
desire
to
erect
a
congress
which
would
not
be
subservient
and
an
executive
which
could
not
be
despotic
and
it
was
equally
to
have
been
expected
that
they
should
regard
an
absolute
separation
of
these
two
great
branches
of
the
system
as
the
only
effectual
means
for
the
accomplishment
of
that
much
desired
end
it
was
impossible
that
they
could
believe
that
executive
and
legislature
could
be
brought
into
close
relations
of
coöperation
and
mutual
confidence
without
being
tempted
nay
even
bidden
to
collude
how
could
either
maintain
its
independence
of
action
unless
each
were
to
have
the
guaranty
of
the
constitution
that
its
own
domain
should
be
absolutely
safe
from
invasion
its
own
prerogatives
absolutely
free
from
challenge
they
shrank
from
placing
sovereign
power
anywhere
they
feared
that
it
would
generate
tyranny
george
iii
had
been
a
tyrant
to
them
and
come
what
might
they
would
not
make
a
george
iii
they
would
conquer
by
dividing
the
power
they
so
much
feared
to
see
in
any
single
hand
the
english
constitution
in
a
word
says
our
most
astute
english
critic
is
framed
on
the
principle
of
choosing
a
single
sovereign
authority
and
making
it
good
the
american
upon
the
principle
of
having
many
sovereign
authorities
and
hoping
that
their
multitude
may
atone
for
their
inferiority
the
americans
now
extol
their
institutions
and
so
defraud
themselves
of
their
due
praise
but
if
they
had
not
a
genius
for
politics
if
they
had
not
a
moderation
in
action
singularly
curious
where
superficial
speech
is
so
violent
if
they
had
not
a
regard
for
law
such
as
no
great
people
have
ever
evinced
and
infinitely
surpassing
ours
the
multiplicity
of
authorities
in
the
american
constitution
would
long
ago
have
brought
it
to
a
bad
end
sensible
shareholders
i
have
heard
a
shrewd
attorney
say
can
work
deed
of
settlement
and
so
the
men
of
massachusetts
could
i
believe
work
constitution
it
is
not
necessary
to
assent
to
strictures
but
it
is
not
possible
to
deny
the
justice
of
this
criticism
in
order
to
be
fair
to
the
memory
of
our
great
however
it
is
necessary
to
remember
that
when
they
sat
in
convention
in
philadelphia
the
english
constitution
which
they
copied
was
not
the
simple
system
which
was
before
bagehot
eyes
when
he
wrote
its
single
sovereign
authority
was
not
then
a
house
of
commons
truly
representative
of
the
nation
and
readily
obeyed
by
a
responsible
ministry
the
sovereignty
was
at
between
the
throne
and
the
parliament
and
the
of
the
beam
was
generally
uppermost
our
device
of
separated
individualized
powers
was
very
much
better
than
a
nominal
sovereignty
of
the
commons
which
was
suffered
to
be
overridden
by
force
fraud
or
craft
by
the
real
sovereignty
of
the
king
the
english
constitution
was
at
that
time
in
reality
much
worse
than
our
own
and
if
it
is
now
superior
it
is
so
because
its
growth
has
not
been
hindered
or
destroyed
by
the
too
tight
ligaments
of
a
written
fundamental
law
the
natural
the
inevitable
tendency
of
every
system
of
like
our
own
and
the
british
is
to
exalt
the
representative
body
the
people
parliament
to
a
position
of
absolute
supremacy
that
tendency
has
i
think
been
quite
as
marked
in
our
own
constitutional
history
as
in
that
of
any
other
country
though
its
power
has
been
to
some
extent
neutralized
and
its
progress
in
great
part
stayed
by
those
denials
of
that
supremacy
which
we
respect
because
they
are
written
in
our
law
the
political
law
written
in
our
hearts
is
here
at
variance
with
that
which
the
constitution
sought
to
establish
a
written
constitution
may
and
often
will
be
violated
in
both
letter
and
spirit
by
a
people
of
energetic
political
talents
and
a
keen
instinct
for
progressive
practical
development
but
so
long
as
they
adhere
to
the
forms
of
such
a
constitution
so
long
as
the
machinery
of
government
supplied
by
it
is
the
only
machinery
which
the
legal
and
moral
sense
of
such
a
people
permits
it
to
use
its
political
development
must
be
in
many
directions
narrowly
restricted
because
of
an
insuperable
lack
of
open
or
adequate
channels
our
constitution
like
every
other
constitution
which
puts
the
authority
to
make
laws
and
the
duty
of
controlling
the
public
expenditure
into
the
hands
of
a
popular
assembly
practically
sets
that
assembly
to
rule
the
affairs
of
the
nation
as
supreme
overlord
but
by
separating
it
entirely
from
its
executive
agencies
it
deprives
it
of
the
opportunity
and
means
for
making
its
authority
complete
and
convenient
the
constitutional
machinery
is
left
of
such
a
pattern
that
other
forces
less
than
that
of
congress
may
cross
and
compete
with
congress
though
they
are
too
small
to
overcome
or
long
offset
it
and
the
result
is
simply
an
unpleasant
wearing
friction
which
with
other
adjustments
more
felicitous
and
equally
safe
might
readily
be
avoided
congress
consequently
is
still
lingering
and
chafing
under
just
such
embarrassments
as
made
the
english
commons
a
nuisance
both
to
themselves
and
to
everybody
else
immediately
after
the
revolution
settlement
had
given
them
their
first
sure
promise
of
supremacy
the
parallel
is
startlingly
exact
in
outer
seeming
the
revolution
of
had
only
transferred
the
sovereignty
over
england
from
james
to
william
and
mary
in
actual
fact
it
had
given
a
powerful
and
decisive
impulse
to
the
great
constitutional
progress
which
was
transferring
the
sovereignty
from
the
king
to
the
house
of
commons
from
the
moment
when
its
sole
right
to
tax
the
nation
was
established
by
the
bill
of
rights
and
when
its
own
resolve
settled
the
practice
of
granting
none
but
annual
supplies
to
the
crown
the
house
of
commons
became
the
supreme
power
in
the
state
but
though
the
constitutional
change
was
complete
the
machinery
of
government
was
far
from
having
adapted
itself
to
the
new
conditions
of
political
life
which
such
a
change
brought
about
however
powerful
the
will
of
the
commons
might
be
it
had
no
means
of
bringing
its
will
directly
to
bear
on
the
control
of
public
affairs
the
ministers
who
had
charge
of
them
were
not
its
servants
but
the
servants
of
the
crown
it
was
from
the
king
that
they
looked
for
direction
and
to
the
king
that
they
held
themselves
responsible
by
impeachment
or
more
indirect
means
the
commons
could
force
a
king
to
remove
a
minister
who
contradicted
their
will
but
they
had
no
constitutional
power
to
replace
the
fallen
statesman
by
a
minister
who
would
carry
out
their
will
the
result
was
the
growth
of
a
temper
in
the
lower
house
which
drove
william
and
his
ministers
to
despair
it
became
as
corrupt
as
jealous
of
power
as
fickle
in
its
resolves
and
factious
in
its
spirit
as
bodies
always
become
whose
consciousness
of
the
possession
of
power
is
untempered
by
a
corresponding
consciousness
of
the
practical
difficulties
or
the
moral
responsibilities
of
the
power
which
they
possess
it
grumbled
and
it
blamed
the
crown
and
its
ministers
for
all
at
which
it
grumbled
but
it
was
hard
to
find
out
what
policy
or
measures
it
would
have
preferred
its
mood
changed
as
william
bitterly
complained
with
every
hour
the
houses
were
in
fact
without
the
guidance
of
recognized
leaders
without
adequate
information
and
destitute
of
that
organization
out
of
which
alone
a
definite
policy
can
come
the
cure
for
this
state
of
things
which
sunderland
had
the
sagacity
to
suggest
and
william
the
wisdom
to
apply
was
the
mediation
between
king
and
commons
of
a
cabinet
representative
of
the
majority
of
the
popular
chamber
a
first
but
long
and
decisive
step
towards
responsible
cabinet
government
whether
a
similar
remedy
would
be
possible
or
desirable
in
our
own
case
it
is
altogether
aside
from
my
present
purpose
to
inquire
i
am
pointing
out
facts
diagnosing
not
prescribing
remedies
my
only
point
just
now
is
that
no
one
can
help
being
struck
by
the
closeness
of
the
likeness
between
the
incipient
distempers
of
the
first
parliaments
of
william
and
mary
and
the
developed
disorders
now
so
plainly
discernible
in
the
constitution
of
congress
though
honest
and
diligent
it
is
meddlesome
and
inefficient
and
it
is
meddlesome
and
inefficient
for
exactly
the
same
reasons
that
made
it
natural
that
the
parliaments
should
exhibit
like
clumsiness
and
like
temper
namely
because
it
is
without
the
guidance
of
recognized
leaders
without
adequate
information
and
destitute
of
that
organization
out
of
which
alone
a
definite
policy
can
come
the
dangers
of
this
serious
imperfection
in
our
governmental
machinery
have
not
been
clearly
demonstrated
in
our
experience
hitherto
but
now
their
delayed
fulfillment
seems
to
be
close
at
hand
the
plain
tendency
is
towards
a
centralization
of
all
the
greater
powers
of
government
in
the
hands
of
the
federal
authorities
and
towards
the
practical
confirmation
of
those
prerogatives
of
supreme
overlordship
which
congress
has
been
gradually
arrogating
to
itself
the
central
government
is
constantly
becoming
stronger
and
more
active
and
congress
is
establishing
itself
as
the
one
sovereign
authority
in
that
government
in
constitutional
theory
and
in
the
broader
features
of
past
practice
ours
has
been
what
bagehot
has
called
a
composite
government
besides
state
and
federal
authorities
to
dispute
as
to
sovereignty
there
have
been
within
the
federal
system
itself
rival
and
irreconcilable
powers
but
gradually
the
strong
are
overcoming
the
weak
if
the
signs
of
the
times
are
to
be
credited
we
are
fast
approaching
an
adjustment
of
sovereignty
quite
as
simple
as
need
be
congress
is
not
only
to
retain
the
authority
it
already
possesses
but
is
to
be
brought
again
and
again
face
to
face
with
still
greater
demands
upon
its
energy
its
wisdom
and
its
conscience
is
to
have
duties
and
responsibilities
thrust
upon
it
without
being
granted
a
opportunity
to
look
back
from
the
plough
to
which
it
has
set
its
hands
the
sphere
and
influence
of
national
administration
and
national
legislation
are
widening
rapidly
our
populations
are
growing
at
such
a
rate
that
one
reckoning
staggers
at
counting
the
possible
millions
that
may
have
a
home
and
a
work
on
this
continent
ere
fifty
more
years
shall
have
filled
their
short
span
the
east
will
not
always
be
the
centre
of
national
life
the
south
is
fast
accumulating
wealth
and
will
faster
recover
influence
the
west
has
already
achieved
a
greatness
which
no
man
can
gainsay
and
has
in
store
a
power
of
future
growth
which
no
man
can
estimate
whether
these
sections
are
to
be
harmonious
or
dissentient
depends
almost
entirely
upon
the
methods
and
policy
of
the
federal
government
if
that

keep
within
its
own
proper
sphere

to

of

look
with
jealousy
and

with
hatred
upon
their
of
another
part

tear

distract
a
country
which
providence
would
bless
but
which
man
may
curse
the
government
of
a
country
so
vast
and
various
must
be
strong
prompt
wieldy
and
efficient
its
strength
must
consist
in
the
certainty
and
uniformity
of
its
purposes
in
its
accord
with
national
sentiment
in
its
unhesitating
action
and
in
its
honest
aims
it
must
be
steadied
and
approved
by
open
administration
diligently
obedient
to
the
more
permanent
judgments
of
public
opinion
and
its
only
active
agency
its
representative
chambers
must
be
equipped
with
something
besides
abundant
powers
of
legislation
as
at
present
constituted
the
federal
government
lacks
strength
because
its
powers
are
divided
lacks
promptness
because
its
authorities
are
multiplied
lacks
wieldiness
because
its
processes
are
roundabout
lacks
efficiency
because
its
responsibility
is
indistinct
and
its
action
without
competent
direction
it
is
a
government
in
which
every
officer
may
talk
about
every
other
officer
duty
without
having
to
render
strict
account
for
not
doing
his
own
and
in
which
the
masters
are
held
in
check
and
offered
contradiction
by
the
servants
lowell
has
called
it
government
by
declamation
talk
is
not
sobered
by
any
necessity
imposed
upon
those
who
utter
it
to
suit
their
actions
to
their
words
there
is
no
day
of
reckoning
for
words
spoken
the
speakers
of
a
congressional
majority
may
without
risk
of
incurring
ridicule
or
discredit
condemn
what
their
own
committees
are
doing
and
the
spokesmen
of
a
minority
may
urge
what
contrary
courses
they
please
with
a
assurance
that
what
they
say
will
be
forgotten
before
they
can
be
called
upon
to
put
it
into
practice
nobody
stands
sponsor
for
the
policy
of
the
government
a
dozen
men
originate
it
a
dozen
compromises
twist
and
alter
it
a
dozen
offices
whose
names
are
scarcely
known
outside
of
washington
put
it
into
execution
this
is
the
defect
to
which
it
will
be
observed
i
am
constantly
recurring
to
which
i
recur
again
and
again
because
every
examination
of
the
system
at
whatsoever
point
begun
leads
inevitably
to
it
as
to
a
central
secret
it
is
the
defect
which
interprets
all
the
rest
because
it
is
their
common
product
it
is
exemplified
in
the
extraordinary
fact
that
the
utterances
of
the
press
have
greater
weight
and
are
accorded
greater
credit
though
the
press
speaks
entirely
without
authority
than
the
utterances
of
congress
though
congress
possesses
all
authority
the
gossip
of
the
street
is
listened
to
rather
than
the
words
of
the
the
editor
directs
public
opinion
the
congressman
obeys
it
when
a
presidential
election
is
at
hand
indeed
the
words
of
the
political
orator
gain
temporary
heed
he
is
recognized
as
an
authority
in
the
arena
as
a
professional
critic
competent
to
discuss
the
good
and
bad
points
and
to
forecast
the
fortunes
of
the
contestants
there
is
something
definite
in
hand
and
he
is
known
to
have
studied
all
its
bearings
he
is
one
of
the
managers
or
is
thought
to
be
well
acquainted
with
the
management
he
speaks
from
the
card
but
let
him
talk
not
about
candidates
but
about
measures
or
about
the
policy
of
the
government
and
his
observations
sink
at
once
to
the
level
of
a
mere
individual
expression
of
opinion
to
which
his
political
occupations
seem
to
add
very
little
weight
it
is
universally
recognized
that
he
speaks
without
authority
about
things
which
his
vote
may
help
to
settle
but
about
which
several
hundred
other
men
have
votes
quite
as
influential
as
his
own
legislation
is
not
a
thing
to
be
known
beforehand
it
depends
upon
the
conclusions
of
sundry
standing
committees
it
is
an
aggregate
not
a
simple
production
it
is
impossible
to
tell
how
many
persons
opinions
and
influences
have
entered
into
its
composition
it
is
even
impracticable
to
determine
from
this
year
what
next
year
will
be
like
speaking
therefore
without
authority
the
political
orator
speaks
to
little
purpose
when
he
speaks
about
legislation
the
papers
do
not
report
him
carefully
and
their
editorials
seldom
take
any
color
from
his
arguments
the
press
being
anonymous
and
representing
a
large
force
of
inquisitive
is
much
more
powerful
than
he
chiefly
because
it
impersonal
and
seems
to
represent
a
wider
and
more
thorough
range
of
information
at
the
worst
it
can
easily
compete
with
any
ordinary
individual
its
individual
opinion
is
quite
sure
to
be
esteemed
as
worthy
of
attention
as
any
other
individual
opinion
and
besides
it
is
almost
everywhere
strong
enough
to
deny
currency
to
the
speeches
of
individuals
whom
it
does
not
care
to
report
it
goes
to
its
audience
the
orator
must
depend
upon
his
audience
coming
to
him
it
can
be
heard
at
every
fireside
the
orator
can
be
heard
only
on
the
platform
or
the
hustings
there
is
no
imperative
demand
on
the
part
of
the
reading
public
in
this
country
that
the
newspapers
should
report
political
speeches
in
full
on
the
contrary
most
readers
would
be
disgusted
at
finding
their
favorite
columns
so
filled
up
by
giving
even
a
notice
of
more
than
an
item
length
to
such
a
speech
an
editor
runs
the
risk
of
being
denounced
as
dull
and
i
believe
that
the
position
of
the
american
press
is
in
this
regard
quite
singular
the
english
newspapers
are
so
far
from
being
thus
independent
and
powers
a
law
unto
themselves
in
the
politics
of
the
empire
that
they
are
constrained
to
do
homage
to
the
political
orator
whether
they
will
or
no
conservative
editors
must
spread
before
their
readers
reports
not
only
of
the
speeches
of
the
leaders
of
their
own
party
but
also
of
the
principal
speeches
of
the
leading
liberal
orators
and
liberal
journals
have
no
choice
but
to
print
every
syllable
of
the
more
important
public
utterances
of
the
conservative
leaders
the
nation
insists
upon
knowing
what
its
public
men
have
to
say
even
when
it
is
not
so
well
said
as
the
newspapers
which
report
them
could
have
said
it
there
are
only
two
things
which
can
give
any
man
a
right
to
expect
that
when
he
speaks
the
whole
country
will
listen
namely
genius
and
authority
probably
no
one
will
ever
contend
that
sir
stafford
northcote
was
an
orator
or
even
a
good
speaker
but
by
proof
of
unblemished
character
and
by
assiduous
conscientious
and
able
public
service
he
rose
to
be
the
recognized
leader
of
his
party
in
the
house
of
commons
and
it
is
simply
because
he
speaks
as
one
having
authority
and
not
as
the
scribes
of
the
press
that
he
is
as
sure
of
a
heedful
hearing
as
is
gladstone
who
adds
genius
and
noble
oratory
to
the
authority
of
established
leadership
the
leaders
of
english
public
life
have
something
besides
weight
of
character
prestige
of
personal
service
and
experience
and
authority
of
individual
opinion
to
exalt
them
above
the
anonymous
press
they
have
definite
authority
and
power
in
the
actual
control
of
government
they
are
directly
commissioned
to
control
the
policy
of
the
administration
they
stand
before
the
country
in
parliament
and
out
of
it
as
the
responsible
chiefs
of
their
parties
it
is
their
business
to
lead
those
parties
and
it
is
the
custom
of
the
constituencies
to
visit
upon
the
parties
the
punishment
due
for
the
mistakes
made
by
these
chiefs
they
are
at
once
the
servants
and
scapegoats
of
their
parties
it
is
these
privileges
and
responsibilities
of
theirs
which
make
their
utterances
considered
worth
hearing
nay
necessary
to
be
heard
and
pondered
their
public
speeches
are
their
platforms
what
the
leader
promises
his
party
stands
ready
to
do
should
it
be
intrusted
with
office
this
certainty
of
audience
and
of
credit
gives
spice
to
what
such
leaders
have
to
say
and
lends
elevation
to
the
tone
of
all
their
public
utterances
they
for
the
most
part
avoid
buncombe
which
would
be
difficult
to
translate
into
acts
of
parliament
it
is
easy
to
see
how
great
an
advantage
their
station
and
influence
give
them
over
our
own
public
men
we
have
no
such
responsible
party
leadership
on
this
side
the
sea
we
are
very
shy
about
conferring
much
authority
on
anybody
and
the
consequence
is
that
it
requires
something
very
like
genius
to
secure
for
any
one
of
our
statesmen
a
universally
recognized
right
to
be
heard
and
to
create
an
desire
to
hear
him
whenever
he
talks
not
about
candidates
but
about
measures
an
extraordinary
gift
of
eloquence
such
as
not
every
generation
may
hope
to
see
will
always
hold
because
it
will
always
captivate
the
attention
of
the
people
but
genius
and
eloquence
are
too
rare
to
be
depended
upon
for
the
instruction
and
guidance
of
the
masses
and
since
our
politicians
lack
the
credit
of
authority
and
responsibility
they
must
give
place
except
at
to
the
press
which
is
everywhere
generally
and
always
talking
it
is
necessarily
government
by
declamation
and
it
is
probably
also
this
lack
of
leadership
which
gives
to
our
national
parties
their
curious
conglomerate
character
it
would
seem
to
be
scarcely
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
they
are
homogeneous
only
in
name
neither
of
the
two
principal
parties
is
of
one
mind
with
itself
each
tolerates
all
sorts
of
difference
of
creed
and
variety
of
aim
within
its
own
ranks
each
pretends
to
the
same
purposes
and
permits
among
its
partisans
the
same
contradictions
to
those
purposes
they
are
grouped
around
no
legislative
leaders
whose
capacity
has
been
tested
and
to
whose
opinions
they
loyally
adhere
they
are
like
armies
without
officers
engaged
upon
a
campaign
which
has
no
great
cause
at
its
back
their
names
and
traditions
not
their
hopes
and
policy
keep
them
together
it
is
to
this
fact
as
well
as
to
short
terms
which
allow
little
time
for
differences
to
come
to
a
head
that
the
easy
agreement
of
congressional
majorities
should
be
attributed
in
other
like
assemblies
the
harmony
of
majorities
is
constantly
liable
to
disturbance
ministers
lose
their
following
and
find
their
friends
falling
away
in
the
midst
of
a
session
but
not
so
in
congress
there
although
the
majority
is
frequently
simply
conglomerate
made
up
of
factions
not
a
few
and
bearing
in
its
elements
every
seed
of
discord
the
harmony
of
party
voting
seldom
if
ever
suffers
an
interruption
so
far
as
outsiders
can
see
legislation
generally
flows
placidly
on
and
the
majority
easily
has
its
own
way
acting
with
a
sort
of
unanimity
with
no
suspicion
of
individual
freedom
of
action
whatever
revolts
may
be
threatened
or
accomplished
in
the
ranks
of
the
party
outside
the
house
at
the
polls
its
power
is
never
broken
inside
the
house
this
is
doubtless
due
in
part
to
the
fact
that
there
is
no
freedom
of
debate
in
the
house
but
there
can
be
no
question
that
it
is
principally
due
to
the
fact
that
debate
is
without
aim
just
because
legislation
is
without
consistency
legislation
is
conglomerate
the
absence
of
any
concert
of
action
amongst
the
committees
leaves
legislation
with
scarcely
any
trace
of
determinate
party
courses
no
two
schemes
pull
together
if
there
is
a
coincidence
of
principle
between
several
bills
of
the
same
session
it
is
generally
accidental
and
the
confusion
of
policy
which
prevents
intelligent
coöperation
also
of
course
prevents
intelligent
differences
and
divisions
there
is
never
a
transfer
of
power
from
one
party
to
the
other
during
a
session
because
such
a
transfer
would
mean
almost
nothing
the
majority
remains
of
one
mind
so
long
as
a
congress
lives
because
its
mind
is
very
vaguely
ascertained
and
its
power
of
planning
a
split
consequently
very
limited
it
has
no
common
mind
and
if
it
had
has
not
the
machinery
for
changing
it
it
is
led
by
a
score
or
two
of
committees
whose
composition
must
remain
the
same
to
the
end
and
who
are
too
numerous
as
well
as
too
disconnected
to
fight
against
it
stays
on
one
side
because
it
hardly
knows
where
the
boundaries
of
that
side
are
or
how
to
cross
them
moreover
there
is
a
certain
piece
of
congressional
machinery
long
ago
invented
and
applied
for
the
special
purpose
of
keeping
both
majority
and
minority
compact
the
legislative
caucus
has
almost
as
important
a
part
in
our
system
as
have
the
standing
committees
and
deserves
as
close
study
as
they
its
functions
are
much
more
easily
understood
in
all
their
bearings
than
those
of
the
committees
however
because
they
are
much
simpler
the
caucus
is
meant
as
an
antidote
to
the
committees
it
is
designed
to
supply
the
cohesive
principle
which
the
multiplicity
and
mutual
independence
of
the
committees
so
powerfully
tend
to
destroy
having
no
prime
minister
to
confer
with
about
the
policy
of
the
government
as
they
see
members
of
parliament
doing
our
congressmen
confer
with
each
other
in
caucus
rather
than
imprudently
expose
to
the
world
the
differences
of
opinion
threatened
or
developed
among
its
members
each
party
hastens
to
remove
disrupting
debate
from
the
floor
of
congress
where
the
speakers
might
too
hastily
commit
themselves
to
insubordination
to
quiet
conferences
behind
closed
doors
where
frightened
scruples
may
be
reassured
and
every
disagreement
healed
with
a
salve
of
compromise
or
subdued
with
the
whip
of
political
expediency
the
caucus
is
the
of
the
party
there
its
discipline
is
renewed
and
strengthened
its
uniformity
of
step
and
gesture
regained
the
voting
and
speaking
in
the
house
are
generally
merely
the
movements
of
a
sort
of
dress
parade
for
which
the
exercises
of
the
caucus
are
designed
to
prepare
it
is
easy
to
see
how
difficult
it
would
be
for
the
party
to
keep
its
head
amidst
the
confused
of
the
committees
without
thus
now
and
again
pulling
itself
together
in
caucus
where
it
can
ask
itself
its
own
mind
and
pledge
itself
anew
to
eternal
agreement
the
credit
of
inventing
this
device
is
probably
due
to
the
democrats
they
appear
to
have
used
it
so
early
as
the
second
session
of
the
eighth
congress
speaking
of
that
session
a
reliable
authority
says
during
this
session
of
congress
there
was
far
less
of
free
and
independent
discussion
on
the
measures
proposed
by
the
friends
of
the
administration
than
had
been
previously
practiced
in
both
branches
of
the
national
legislature
it
appeared
that
on
the
most
important
subjects
the
course
adopted
by
the
majority
was
the
effect
of
caucus
arrangement
or
in
other
words
had
been
previously
agreed
upon
at
meetings
of
the
democratic
members
held
in
private
thus
the
legislation
of
congress
was
constantly
swayed
by
a
party
following
feelings
and
pledges
rather
than
according
to
sound
reason
or
personal
conviction
the
censure
implied
in
this
last
sentence
may
have
seemed
righteous
at
the
time
when
such
caucus
pledges
were
in
disfavor
as
shackles
but
it
would
hardly
be
accepted
as
just
by
the
intensely
practical
politicians
of
they
would
probably
prefer
to
put
it
thus
that
the
silvern
speech
spent
in
caucus
secures
the
golden
silence
maintained
on
the
floor
of
congress
making
each
party
rich
in
concord
and
happy
in
coöperation
the
fact
that
makes
this
defense
of
the
caucus
not
altogether
conclusive
is
that
it
is
shielded
from
all
responsibility
by
its
sneaking
privacy
it
has
great
power
without
any
balancing
weight
of
accountability
probably
its
debates
would
constitute
interesting
and
instructive
reading
for
the
public
were
they
published
but
they
never
get
out
except
in
rumors
often
rehearsed
and
as
often
amended
they
are
one
may
take
it
for
granted
much
more
candid
and
go
much
nearer
the
political
heart
of
the
questions
discussed
than
anything
that
is
ever
said
openly
in
congress
to
the
reporters
gallery
they
approach
matters
without
masks
and
handle
them
without
gloves
it
might
hurt
but
it
would
enlighten
us
to
hear
them
as
it
is
however
there
is
unhappily
no
ground
for
denying
their
power
to
override
sound
reason
and
personal
conviction
the
caucus
can
not
always
silence
or
subdue
a
large
and
influential
minority
of
dissentients
but
its
whip
seldom
fails
to
reduce
individual
malcontents
and
mutineers
into
submission
there
is
no
place
in
congressional
jousts
for
the
free
lance
the
man
who
disobeys
his
party
caucus
is
understood
to
disavow
his
party
allegiance
altogether
and
to
assume
that
dangerous
neutrality
which
is
so
apt
to
degenerate
into
mere
caprice
and
which
is
almost
sure
to
destroy
his
influence
by
bringing
him
under
the
suspicion
of
being
unreliable
a
suspicion
always
conclusively
damning
in
practical
life
any
individual
or
any
minority
of
weak
numbers
or
small
influence
who
has
the
temerity
to
neglect
the
decisions
of
the
caucus
is
sure
if
the
offense
be
often
repeated
or
even
once
committed
upon
an
important
issue
to
be
read
out
of
the
party
almost
without
chance
of
reinstatement
and
every
one
knows
that
nothing
can
be
accomplished
in
politics
by
mere
disagreement
the
only
privilege
such
recalcitrants
gain
is
the
privilege
of
disagreement
they
are
forever
shut
out
from
the
privilege
of
confidential
coöperation
they
have
chosen
the
helplessness
of
a
faction
it
must
be
admitted
however
that
unfortunate
as
the
necessity
is
for
the
existence
of
such
powers
as
those
of
the
caucus
that
necessity
actually
exists
and
can
not
be
neglected
against
the
fatal
action
of
so
many
elements
of
disintegration
it
would
seem
to
be
imperatively
needful
that
some
energetic
element
of
cohesion
should
be
provided
it
is
doubtful
whether
in
any
other
nation
with
a
shorter
inheritance
of
political
instinct
parties
could
long
successfully
resist
the
centrifugal
forces
of
the
committee
system
with
only
the
varying
attraction
of
the
caucus
to
detain
them
the
wonder
is
that
despite
the
forcible
and
unnatural
divorcement
of
legislation
and
administration
and
the
consequent
distraction
of
legislation
from
all
attention
to
anything
like
an
intelligent
planning
and
superintendence
of
policy
we
are
not
cursed
with
as
many
factions
as
now
almost
hopelessly
confuse
french
politics
that
we
have
had
and
continue
to
have
only
two
national
parties
of
national
importance
or
real
power
is
fortunate
rather
than
natural
their
names
stand
for
a
fact
but
scarcely
for
a
reason
an
intelligent
observer
of
our
politics
has
declared
that
there
is
in
the
united
states
a
class
including
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
of
the
best
men
in
the
country
who
think
it
possible
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
good
government
without
working
for
them
every
one
who
has
seen
beyond
the
outside
of
our
american
life
must
recognize
the
truth
of
this
to
explain
it
is
to
state
the
sum
of
all
the
most
valid
criticisms
of
congressional
government
public
opinion
has
no
easy
vehicle
for
its
judgments
no
quick
channels
for
its
action
nothing
about
the
system
is
direct
and
simple
authority
is
perplexingly
subdivided
and
distributed
and
responsibility
has
to
be
hunted
down
in
corners
so
that
the
sum
of
the
whole
matter
is
that
the
means
of
working
for
the
fruits
of
good
government
are
not
readily
to
be
found
the
average
citizen
may
be
excused
for
esteeming
government
at
best
but
a
haphazard
affair
upon
which
his
vote
and
all
of
his
influence
can
have
but
little
effect
how
is
his
choice
of
a
representative
in
congress
to
affect
the
policy
of
the
country
as
regards
the
questions
in
which
he
is
most
interested
if
the
man
for
whom
he
votes
has
no
chance
of
getting
on
the
standing
committee
which
has
virtual
charge
of
those
questions
how
is
it
to
make
any
difference
who
is
chosen
president
has
the
president
any
very
great
authority
in
matters
of
vital
policy
it
seems
almost
a
thing
of
despair
to
get
any
assurance
that
any
vote
he
may
cast
will
even
in
an
infinitesimal
degree
affect
the
essential
courses
of
administration
there
are
so
many
cooks
mixing
their
ingredients
in
the
national
broth
that
it
seems
hopeless
this
thing
of
changing
one
cook
at
a
time
the
charm
of
our
constitutional
ideal
has
now
been
long
enough
wound
up
to
enable
sober
men
who
do
not
believe
in
political
witchcraft
to
judge
what
it
has
accomplished
and
is
likely
still
to
accomplish
without
further
winding
the
constitution
is
not
honored
by
blind
worship
the
more
we
become
as
a
nation
to
its
defects
and
the
prompter
we
grow
in
applying
with
the
unhesitating
courage
of
conviction
all
or
expedients
necessary
to
make
among
us
a
straightforward
thing
of
simple
method
single
unstinted
power
and
clear
responsibility
the
nearer
will
we
approach
to
the
sound
sense
and
practical
genius
of
the
great
and
honorable
statesmen
of
and
the
first
step
towards
emancipation
from
the
timidity
and
false
pride
which
have
led
us
to
seek
to
thrive
despite
the
defects
of
our
national
system
rather
than
seem
to
deny
its
perfection
is
a
fearless
criticism
of
that
system
when
we
shall
have
examined
all
its
parts
without
sentiment
and
ganged
all
its
functions
by
the
standards
of
practical
common
sense
we
shall
have
established
anew
our
right
to
the
claim
of
political
sagacity
and
it
will
remain
only
to
act
intelligently
upon
what
our
opened

have
seen

about
ten
minutes
seven
bills
providing
for
public
buildings
in
different
states
appropriating
an
aggregate
of
in
this
short
time
a
recent
house
feat
was
one
in
which
a
bill
allowing
war
claims
in
a
lump
was
passed
it
contained
one
hundred
and
nineteen
pages
full
of
little
claims
amounting
in
all
to
and
a
member
in
deprecating
criticism
on
this
disposition
of
them
said
that
the
committee
had
received
ten
huge
bags
full
of
such
claims
which
had
been
adjudicated
by
the
treasury
officials
and
it
was
a
physical
impossibility
to
examine
n
y
congress
though
constantly
erecting
new
committees
never
gives
up
old
ones
no
matter
how
useless
they
may
have
become
by
subtraction
of
duties
thus
there
is
not
only
the
superseded
committee
on
public
expenditures
but
the
committee
on
manufactures
also
which
when
a
part
of
the
committee
on
commerce
and
manufactures
had
plenty
to
do
but
which
since
the
creation
of
a
distinct
committee
on
commerce
has
had
nothing
to
do
having
now
together
with
the
committees
on
agriculture
and
indian
affairs
no
duties
assigned
to
it
by
the
rules
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
the
committee
on
commerce
will
suffer
a
like
eclipse
because
of
the
gift
of
its
principal
duties
to
the
new
committee
on
rivers
and
harbors
see
the
report
of
this
committee
which
was
under
the
chairmanship
of
senator
windom
an
illustration
of
what
the
house
committees
find
by
special
effort
may
be
seen
in
the
revelations
of
the
investigation
of
the
expenses
of
the
notorious
star

trials
made
by
the
committee

the

can
he
evade
the
obligation
of
enforcing
it
his
sincere
and
zealous
coöperation
is
no
doubt
useful
but
it
is
not
indispensable
in
the
carrying
on
of
public
affairs
all
his
important
acts
are
directly
or
indirectly
submitted
to
the
legislature
and
of
his
own
free
authority
he
can
do
but
little
it
is
therefore
his
weakness
and
not
his
power
which
enables
him
to
remain
in
opposition
to
congress
in
europe
harmony
must
reign
between
the
crown
and
the
other
branches
of
the

because
a
collision
between
them
may

harmony
is
