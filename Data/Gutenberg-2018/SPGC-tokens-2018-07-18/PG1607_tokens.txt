a
romance
of

by
john
jacob
astor
preface
the
protracted
struggle
between
science
and
the
classics
appears
to
be
drawing
to
a
close
with
victory
about
to
perch
on
the
banner
of
science
as
a
perusal
of
almost
any
university
or
college
catalogue
shows
while
a
limited
knowledge
of
both
greek
and
latin
is
important
for
the
correct
use
of
our
own
language
the
amount
till
recently
required
in
my
judgment
has
been
absurdly
out
of
proportion
to
the
intrinsic
value
of
these
branches
or
perhaps
more
correctly
roots
of
study
the
classics
have
been
thoroughly
and
painfully
threshed
out
and
it
seems
impossible
that
anything
new
can
be
unearthed
we
may
equal
the
performances
of
the
past
but
there
is
no
opportunity
to
surpass
them
or
produce
anything
original
even
the
mental
training
argument
is
beginning
to
pall
for
would
not
anything
equally
difficult
give
as
good
developing
results
while
by
learning
a
live
matter
we
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
there
can
be
no
question
that
there
are
many
forces
and
influences
in
nature
whose
existence
we
as
yet
little
more
than
suspect
how
much
more
interesting
it
would
be
if
instead
of
reiterating
our
past
achievements
the
magazines
and
literature
of
the
period
should
devote
their
consideration
to
what
we
do
not
know
it
is
only
through
investigation
and
research
that
inventions
come
we
may
not
find
what
we
are
in
search
of
but
may
discover
something
of
perhaps
greater
moment
it
is
probable
that
the
principal
glories
of
the
future
will
be
found
in
as
yet
but
little
trodden
paths
and
as

justly
says

jupiter
jupiter
the
magnificent
planet
with
a
diameter
of
miles
having
times
the
surface
and
times
the
volume
of
the
earth
lay
beneath
them
they
had
often
seen
it
in
the
terrestrial
sky
emitting
its
strong
steady
ray
and
had
thought
of
that
planet
about
which
till
recently
so
little
had
been
known
and
a
burning
desire
had
possessed
them
to
go
to
it
and
explore
its
mysteries
now
thanks
to
apergy
the
force
whose
existence
the
ancients
suspected
but
of
which
they
knew
so
little
all
things
were
possible
ayrault
manipulated
the
glass
handles
and
the
callisto
moved
on
slowly
in
comparison
with
its
recent
speed
and
all
remained
glued
to
their
telescopes
as
they
peered
through
the
rushing
clouds
now
forming
and
now
dissolving
before
their
eyes
what
transports
of
delight
what
ecstatic
bliss
was
theirs
men
had
discovered
and
mastered
the
secret
of
apergy
and
now
little
lower
than
the
angels
they
could
soar
through
space
leaving
even
planets
and
comets
behind
is
it
not
strange
said
cortlandt
that
though
it
has
been
known
for
over
a
century
that
bodies
charged
with
unlike
electricities
attract
one
another
and
those
charged
with
like
repel
no
one
thought
of
utilizing
the
counterpart
of
gravitation
in
the
nineteenth
century
savants
and
indian
jugglers
performed
experiments
with
their
disciples
and
masses
of
inert
matter
by
causing
them
to
remain
without
visible
support
at
some
distance
from
the
ground
and
while
many
of
these
of
course
were
quacks
some
were
on
the
right
track
though
they
did
not
push
their
research
president
bearwarden
and
ayrault
assented
they
were
steering
for
an
apparently
hard
part
of
the
planet
surface
about
a
degree
and
a
half
north
of
its
equator
since
jupiter
axis
is
almost
at
right
angles
to
the
plane
of
its
orbit
said
the
doctor
being
inclined
only
about
one
degree
and
a
half
instead
of
and
a
half
as
was
the
earth
till
nearly
so
recently
it
will
be
possible
for
us
to
have
any
climate
we
wish
from
constantly
warm
at
the
equator
to
constantly
cool
or
cold
as
we
approach
the
poles
without
being
troubled
by
extremes
of
winter
and
summer
until
the
callisto
entered
the
planet
atmosphere
its
five
moons
appeared
like
silver
shields
against
the
black
sky
but
now
things
were
looking
more
terrestrial
and
they
began
to
feel
at
home
bearwarden
put
down
his
and
ayrault
returned
a
photograph
to
his
pocket
while
all
three
gazed
at
their
new
abode
beneath
them
was
a
vast
continent
variegated
by
chains
of
lakes
and
rivers
stretching
away
in
all
directions
except
toward
the
equator
where
lay
a
placid
ocean
as
far
as
their
telescopes
could
pierce
to
the
eastward
were
towering
and
massive
mountains
and
along
the
southern
border
of
the
continent
smoking
volcanoes
while
toward
the
west
they
saw
forests
gently
rolling
plains
and
that
would
have
satisfied
a
poet
or
set
an
agriculturist
heart
at
rest
how
i
should
like
to
mine
those
hills
for
copper
or
drain
the
swamps
to
the
south
exclaimed
bearwarden
the
lake
superior
mines
and
the
reclamation
of
the
florida
everglades
would
be
nothing
to
this
any
inhabitants
we
may
find
here
have
so
much
land
at
their
disposal
that
they
will
not
need
to
drain
swamps
on
account
of
pressure
of
population
for
some
time
put
in
the
doctor
i
hope
we
may
find
some
inhabitants
said
ayrault
thinking
of
their
explosive
magazine
rifles
if
jupiter
is
passing
through
its
jurassic
or
mesozoic
period
there
must
be
any
amount
of
some
kind
of
game
just
then
a
quiver
shook
the
callisto
and
glancing
to
the
right
they
noticed
one
of
the
volcanoes
in
violent
eruption
smoke
filled
the
air
in
clouds
hot
stones
and
then
floods
of
lava
poured
from
the
crater
while
even
the
walls
of
the
hermetically
sealed
callisto
could
not
arrest
the
thunderous
crashes
that
made
the
interior
of
the
car
resound
had
we
not
better
move
on
said
bearwarden
and
accordingly
they
went
toward
the
woods
they
had
first
seen
finding
a
firm
strip
of
land
between
the
forest
and
an
arm
of
the
sea
they
gently
grounded
the
callisto
and
not
being
altogether
sure
how
the
atmosphere
of
their
new
abode
would
suit
terrestrial
lungs
or
what
its
pressure
to
the
square
inch
might
be
they
cautiously
opened
a
a
crack
retaining
their
hold
upon
it
with
its
screw
instantly
there
was
a
rush
and
a
whistling
sound
as
of
escaping
steam
while
in
a
few
moments
their
barometer
stood
at
inches
whereupon
they
closed
the
opening
i
fancy
said
cortlandt
we
had
better
wait
now
till
we
become
accustomed
to
this
pressure
i
do
not
believe
it
will
go
much
higher
for
the
window
made
but
little
resistance
when
we
shut
it
finding
they
were
not
inconvenienced
by
a
pressure
but
little
greater
than
that
of
a
deep
they
again
opened
the
port
whereupon
their
barometer
showed
a
further
rise
to
and
then
remained
stationary
finding
also
that
the
chemical
composition
of
the
air
suited
them
and
that
they
had
no
difficulty
in
breathing
the
pressure
being
the
same
as
that
sustained
by
a
diver
in
fourteen
feet
of
water
they
opened
a
door
and
emerged
they
knew
fairly
well
what
to
expect
and
were
not
disturbed
by
their
new
conditions
though
they
had
apparently
gained
a
good
deal
in
weight
as
a
result
of
their
ethereal
journey
this
did
not
incommode
them
for
though
jupiter
volume
is
thirteen
hundred
times
that
of
the
earth
on
account
of
its
lesser
specific
gravity
it
has
but
three
hundred
times
the
mass
it
would
weigh
but
three
hundred
times
as
much
further
although
a
cubic
foot
of
water
or
anything
else
weighs
as
much
as
on
earth
objects
near
the
equator
on
account
of
jupiter
rapid
rotation
weigh
one
fifth
less
than
they
do
at
the
poles
by
reason
of
the
centrifugal
force
influenced
by
this
fact
and
also
because
they
were
miles
from
the
sun
instead
of
as
on
earth
they
had
steered
for
the
northern
limit
of
jupiter
tropics
and
in
addition
to
this
they
could
easily
apply
the
apergetic
power
in
any
degree
to
themselves
when
beyond
the
limits
of
the
callisto
and
so
be
attracted
to
any
extent
from
twice
the
pull
they
receive
from
gravitation
on
earth
to
almost
nothing
bearwarden
and
ayrault
shouldered
their
rifles
while
cortlandt
took
a
repeating
with
no
shot
and
having
also
some
and
a
sextant
all
three
set
out
in
a
northwesterly
direction
the
ground
was
rather
soft
and
a
warm
vapor
seemed
to
rise
from
it
to
the
east
the
sky
was
veiled
by
dense
clouds
of
smoke
from
the
towering
volcanoes
while
on
their
left
the
forest
seemed
to
extend
without
limit
clumps
of
huge
ferns
were
scattered
about
and
the
ground
was
covered
with
curious
tracks
jupiter
is
evidently
passing
through
a
carboniferous
or
devonian
period
such
as
existed
on
earth
though
if
consistent
with
its
size
it
should
be
on
a
vastly
larger
scale
said
the
doctor
i
never
believed
in
the
theory
he
continued
that
the
larger
the
planet
the
smaller
should
be
its
inhabitants
and
always
considered
it
a
makeshift
put
forward
in
the
absence
of
definite
knowledge
the
idea
being
apparently
that
the
weight
of
very
large
creatures
would
be
too
great
for
their
strength
of
the
fact
that
mastodons
and
creatures
far
larger
than
any
now
living
on
earth
existed
there
we
have
absolute
proof
though
gravitation
must
have
been
practically
the
same
then
as
now
just
here
they
came
upon
a
number
of
huge
bones
evidently
the
remains
of
some
saurian
and
many
times
the
size
of
a
grown
crocodile
on
passing
a
growth
of
most
luxuriant
vegetation
they
saw
a
sacklike
objects
and
drawing
nearer
noticed
that
the
tops
began
to
swell
and
at
the
same
time
became
lighter
in
colour
just
as
the
doctor
was
about
to
investigate
one
of
them
with
his
the
enormously
inflated
tops
of
the
creatures
collapsed
with
a
loud
report
and
the
entire
group
soared
away
when
about
to
alight
forty
yards
off
they
distended
membranous
folds
in
the
manner
of
wings
which
checked
their
descent
and
on
touching
the
ground
remained
where
they
were
without
rebound
we
expected
to
find
all
kinds
of
reptiles
and
birds
exclaimed
the
doctor
but
i
do
not
know
how
we
should
class
those
creatures
they
seem
to
have
pneumatic
feet
and
legs
for
their
motion
was
certainly
not
produced
like
that
of
frogs
when
the
party
came
up
with
them
the
heads
again
began
to
swell
i
will
perforate
the
of
one
said
bearwarden
withdrawing
the
explosive
cartridge
from
the
barrel
of
his
rifle
and
substituting
one
with
a
solid
ball
this
will
doubtless
disable
one
so
that
we
can
examine
it
just
as
they
were
about
to
rise
he
shot
the
largest
through
the
neck
all
but
the
wounded
one
soared
off
while
bearwarden
ayrault
and
cortlandt
approached
to
examine
it
more
closely
you
see
said
cortlandt
this
vertebrate
for
that
is
as
definitely
as
we
can
yet
describe
it
forces
a
great
pressure
of
air
into
its
head
and
neck
which
by
the
action
of
valves
it
must
allow
to
rush
into
its
very
rudimentary
lower
extremities
distending
them
with
such
violence
that
the
body
is
shot
upward
and
forward
you
may
have
noticed
the
tightly
inflated
portion
underneath
as
they
left
the
ground
while
speaking
he
had
moved
rather
near
when
suddenly
a
partially
concealed
mouth
opened
showing
the
unmistakable
tongue
and
fangs
of
a
serpent
it
emitted
a
hissing
sound
and
the
small
eyes
gleamed
maliciously
do
you
believe
it
is
a
poisonous
species
asked
ayrault
i
suspect
it
is
replied
the
doctor
for
though
it
is
doubtless
able
to
leap
with
great
accuracy
upon
its
prey
we
saw
it
took
some
time
to
recharge
the
upper
so
that
were
it
not
armed
with
poison
glands
it
would
fall
an
easy
victim
to
its
more
powerful
and
swifter
contemporaries
and
would
soon
become
extinct
as
it
will
be
unable
to
spring
for
some
time
said
bearwarden
we
might
as
well
save
it
the
disappointment
of
trying
and
snapping
the
used
shell
from
his
rifle
he
fired
an
explosive
ball
into
the
reptile
whereupon
about
half
the
body
disappeared
while
a
sickening
odour
arose
although
the
sun
was
still
far
above
the
horizon
the
rapidity
with
which
it
was
descending
showed
that
the
short
night
of
less
than
five
hours
would
soon
be
upon
them
and
though
short
it
might
be
very
dark
for
they
were
in
the
tropics
and
the
sun
going
down
perpendicularly
must
also
pass
completely
around
the
globe
instead
of
as
in
northern
latitudes
on
earth
in
summer
approaching
the
horizon
obliquely
and
not
going
far
below
it
a
slight
and
diffused
sound
here
seemed
to
rise
from
the
ground
all
about
them
for
which
they
could
not
account
presently
it
became
louder
and
as
the
sun
touched
the
horizon
it
poured
forth
in
prolonged
strains
the
large
lilies
reeds
and
heliotropes
seemed
fairly
to
throb
as
they
raised
their
anthem
to
the
sky
and
the
setting
sun
while
the
air
grew
dark
with
clouds
of
birds
that
gradually
alighted
on
the
ground
until
as
the
chorus
grew
fainter
and
gradually
ceased
they
flew
back
to
their
nests
the
three
companions
had
stood
astonished
while
this
act
was
played
the
doctor
then
spoke
this
is
the
most
marvellous
development
of
nature
i
have
seen
for
its
wonderful
divergence
from
and
yet
analogy
to
what
takes
place
on
earth
you
know
our
flowers
offer
honey
as
it
were
as
bait
to
insects
that
in
eating
or
collecting
it
they
may
catch
the
pollen
on
their
legs
and
so
carry
it
to
other
flowers
perhaps
of
the
opposite
sex
here
flowers
evidently
appeal
to
the
sense
of
hearing
instead
of
taste
and
make
use
of
birds
of
which
there
are
enormous
numbers
instead
of
winged
insects
of
which
i
have
seen
none
one
being
perhaps
the
natural
result
of
the
other
the
flowers
have
become
singers
by
long
practice
or
else
those
that
were
most
musical
having
had
the
best
chance
to
reproduce
we
have
a
neat
illustration
of
the
of
the
fittest
the
sound
is
doubtless
produced
by
a
shrinking
of
the
fibres
as
the
sun
withdraws
its
heat
in
which
case
we
may
expect
another
song
at
sunrise
when
the
same
result
will
be
effected
by
their
expanding
searching
for
a
in
which
to
pass
the
coming
hours
they
saw
lights
flitting
about
like
but
brighter
and
intermittent
they
seem
to
be
as
bright
as
lamps
but
the
light
is
yellower
and
appears
to
emanate
from
a
comparatively
large
surface
certainly
nine
or
ten
inches
square
said
the
doctor
they
soon
gave
up
the
chase
however
for
the
lights
were
continually
moving
and
frequently
went
out
while
groping
in
the
growing
darkness
they
came
upon
a
brown
object
about
the
size
of
a
small
dog
and
close
to
the
ground
it
flew
off
with
a
humming
insect
sound
and
as
it
did
so
it
showed
the
brilliant
phosphorescent
glow
they
had
observed
that
is
a
said
bearwarden
evidently
the
insects
here
are
on
the
same
scale
as
everything
else
they
are
like
the
in
cuba
which
the
cubans
are
said
to
put
into
a
glass
box
and
get
light
enough
from
to
read
by
here
they
would
need
only
one
if
it
could
be
induced
to
give
its
light
continuously
having
found
an
open
space
on
high
ground
they
sat
down
and
bearwarden
struck
his
repeater
which
for
convenience
had
been
arranged
for
jupiter
time
dividing
the
day
into
ten
hours
beginning
at
noon
midnight
being
therefore
five
twenty
minutes
past
four
said
he
which
would
correspond
to
about
a
quarter
to
eleven
on
earth
as
the
sun
rises
at
seven
it
will
be
dark
about
three
hours
for
the
time
between
dawn
and
daylight
will
of
course
be
as
short
as
that
we
have
just
experienced
between
sunset
and
night
if
we
stay
here
long
said
the
doctor
i
suppose
we
shall
become
accustomed
like
sailors
to
taking
our
four
or
in
this
case
five
hours
on
duty
and
five
hours
off
or
added
ayrault
we
can
sleep
ten
consecutive
hours
and
take
the
next
ten
for
exploring
and
hunting
having
the
sun
for
one
half
the
time
and
the
moons
for
the
other
bearwarden
and
cortlandt
now
rolled
themselves
in
their
blankets
and
were
soon
asleep
while
ayrault
whose
turn
it
was
to
watch
till
the
moons
rose
for
they
had
not
yet
enough
confidence
in
their
new
domain
to
sleep
in
darkness
simultaneously
leaned
his
back
against
a
rock
and
lighted
his
pipe
in
the
distance
he
saw
the
torrents
of
fiery
lava
from
the
volcanoes
reflected
in
the
sky
and
faintly
heard
their
thunderous
crashes
while
the
twinkled
unconcernedly
in
the
hollow
and
the
night
winds
swayed
the
fernlike
branches
then
he
gazed
at
the
earth
which
but
little
above
the
horizon
shone
with
a
faint
but
steady
ray
and
his
mind
eye
ran
beyond
his
natural
vision
while
he
pictured
to
himself
the
girl
of
his
heart
wishing
that
by
some
communion
of
spirits
he
might
convey
his
thoughts
to
her
and
receive
hers
it
was
now
the
first
week
of
january
on
earth
he
could
almost
see
her
house
and
the
trees
in
the
park
and
knew
that
at
that
hour
she
was
dressing
for
dinner
and
hoped
and
believed
that
he
was
in
her
heart
while
he
thus
mused
one
moon
after
another
rose
each
at
a
different
phase
till
three
were
at
once
in
the
sky
adjusting
the
electric
wires
that
were
to
paralyze
any
creature
that
attempted
to
come
within
the
circle
and
would
arouse
them
by
ringing
a
bell
he
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
rolled
himself
in
a
blanket
and
was
soon
asleep
beside
his
friends
chapter
ii
antecedental
come
in
sounded
a
voice
as
cortlandt
and
dick
ayrault
tapped
at
the
door
of
the
president
of
the
terrestrial
axis
straightening
company
private
office
on
the
morning
of
the
of
june
bearwarden
sat
at
his
capacious
desk
the
shadows
passing
over
his
face
as
april
clouds
flit
across
the
sun
he
was
a
handsome
man
and
young
for
the
important
post
he
filled
being
scarcely
forty
a
graduate
of
west
point
with
great
executive
ability
and
a
wonderful
engineer
sit
down

said
he
we
have
still
a
half
hour
before
i
begin
to
read
the
report
i
am
to
make
to
the
stockholders
and
representatives
of
all
the
governments
which
is
now
ready
i
know
you
smoke
passing
a
box
of
havanas
to
the
professor
cortlandt
ll
united
states
government
expert
appointed
to
examine
the
company
calculations
was
about
fifty
with
a
high
forehead
greyish
hair
and
quick
grey
eyes
a
geologist
and
astronomer
and
altogether
as
able
a
man
in
his
own
way
as
bearwarden
in
his
richard
ayrault
a
large
stockholder
and
one
of
the
honorary
in
the
company
was
about
thirty
a
university
man
by
nature
a
scientist
and
engaged
to
one
of
the
prettiest
society
girls
who
was
then
a
student
at
vassar
in
the
beautiful
town
of
poughkeepsie
knowing
the
way
you
carry
things
in
your
mind
and
the
difficulty
of
rattling
you
said
cortlandt
we
have
dropped
in
on
our
way
to
hear
the
speech
that
i
would
not
miss
for
a
fortune
let
us
know
if
we
bother
you
impossible
dear
boy
replied
the
president
genially
since
i
survived
your
official
investigations
i
think
i
deserve
some
of
your
attention
informally
here
are
my
final
examinations
said
cortlandt
handing
bearwarden
a
roll
of
papers
i
have
been
over
all
your
figures
and
testify
to
their
accuracy
in
the
appendix
i
have
added
so
they
sat
and
chatted
about
the
enterprise
that
interested
cortlandt
and
ayrault
almost
as
much
as
bearwarden
himself
as
the
clock
struck
eleven
the
president
of
the
company
put
on
his
hat
and
saying
au
revoir
to
his
friends
crossed
the
street
to
the
opera
house
in
which
he
was
to
read
a
report
that
would
be
copied
in
all
the
great
journals
and
heard
over
thousands
of
miles
of
wire
in
every
part
of
the
globe
when
he
arrived
the
vast
building
was
already
filled
with
a
distinguished
company
representing
the
greatest
intelligence
wealth
and
powers
of
the
world
bearwarden
went
in
by
the
stage
entrance
exchanging
greetings
as
he
did
so
with
officers
of
the
company
and
directors
who
had
come
to
hear
him
cortlandt
and
ayrault
entered
by
the
regular
door
the
former
going
to
the
government
box
the
latter
to
join
his
fiancee
sylvia
preston
who
was
there
with
her
mother
bearwarden
had
a
roll
of
manuscript
at
hand
but
so
well
did
he
know
his
speech
that
he
scarcely
glanced
at
it
after
being
introduced
by
the
chairman
of
the
meeting
and
seeing
that
his
audience
was
all
attention
he
began
holding
himself
erect
his
clear
powerful
voice
making
every
part
of
the
building
ring
chapter
iii
president
bearwarden
speech
to
the
bondholders
and
stockholders
of
the
terrestrial
axis
straightening
company
and
representatives
of
earthly
governments
gentlemen
you
know
that
the
objects
of
this
company
are
to
straighten
the
axis
of
the
earth
to
combine
the
extreme
heat
of
summer
with
the
intense
cold
of
winter
and
produce
a
uniform
temperature
for
each
degree
of
latitude
the
year
round
at
present
the
earth
axis
that
is
the
line
passing
through
its
centre
and
the
two
poles
is
inclined
to
the
ecliptic
about
and
a
half
degrees
our
summer
is
produced
by
the
northern
hemisphere
leaning
at
that
angle
towards
the
sun
and
our
winter
by
its
turning
that
much
from
it
in
one
case
the
sun
rays
are
caused
to
shine
more
perpendicularly
and
in
the
other
more
obliquely
this
wabbling
like
that
of
a
top
is
the
sole
cause
of
the
seasons
since
owing
to
the
eccentricity
of
our
orbit
the
earth
is
actually
fifteen
hundred
thousand
miles
nearer
the
sun
during
our
winter
in
the
northern
hemisphere
than
in
summer
that
there
is
no
limit
to
a
inclination
and
that
inclination
is
not
essential
we
have
astronomical
proof
venus
axis
is
inclined
to
the
plane
of
her
orbit
degrees
so
that
the
arctic
circle
comes
within
fifteen
degrees
of
the
equator
and
the
tropics
also
extend
to
latitude
degrees
or
within
fifteen
degrees
of
the
poles
producing
great
extremes
of
heat
and
cold
venus
is
made
still
more
difficult
of
habitation
by
the
fact
that
she
rotates
on
her
axis
in
the
same
time
that
she
revolves
about
the
sun
in
the
same
way
that
the
moon
does
about
the
earth
so
that
one
side
must
be
perpetually
frozen
while
the
other
is
parched
in
uranus
we
see
the
axis
tilted
still
further
so
that
the
arctic
circle
descends
to
the
equator
the
most
varied
climate
must
therefore
prevail
during
its
year
whose
length
exceeds
of
ours
the
axis
of
mars
is
inclined
about
and
two
thirds
degrees
to
the
plane
of
its
orbit
consequently
its
seasons
must
be
very
similar
to
ours
the
extremes
of
heat
and
cold
being
somewhat
greater
in
jupiter
we
have
an
illustration
of
a
planet
whose
axis
is
almost
at
right
angles
to
the
plane
of
its
orbit
being
inclined
but
about
a
degree
and
a
half
the
hypothetical
inhabitants
of
this
majestic
planet
must
therefore
have
perpetual
summer
at
the
equator
eternal
winter
at
the
poles
and
in
the
temperate
regions
everlasting
spring
on
account
of
the
straightness
of
the
axis
however
even
the
polar
inhabitants
if
there
are
any
are
not
oppressed
by
a
six
months
night
for
all
except
those
at
the
very
pole
have
a
sunrise
and
a
sunset
every
ten
hours
the
exact
day
being
nine
hours
fifty
five
minutes
and
seconds
the
warmth
of
the
tropics
is
also
tempered
by
the
high
winds
that
must
result
from
the
rapid
whirl
on
its
axis
every
object
at
the
equator
being
carried
around
by
this
at
the
rate
of
miles
an
hour
or
over
three
thousand
miles
farther
than
the
earth
equator
moves
in
hours
the
inclination
of
the
axis
of
our
own
planet
has
also
frequently
considerably
exceeded
that
of
mars
and
again
has
been
but
little
greater
than
jupiter
at
least
this
is
by
all
odds
the
most
reasonable
explanation
of
the
numerous
glacial
periods
through
which
our
globe
has
passed
and
of
the
recurring
mild
spells
probably
lasting
thousands
of
years
in
which
elephants
mastodons
and
other
vertebrates
roamed
in
siberia
some
of
which
died
so
recently
that
their
flesh
preserved
by
the
cold
has
been
devoured
by
the
dogs
of
modern
explorers
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
the
inclining
of
the
axes
of
jupiter
venus
the
earth
and
the
other
planets
is
now
fixed
in
some
cases
it
is
known
to
be
changing
as
long
ago
as
drayson
of
the
british
army
showed
in
a
work
entitled
untrodden
ground
in
astronomy
and
geology
that
as
a
result
of
the
second
rotation
of
the
earth
the
inclination
of
its
axis
was
changing
it
having
been
on
january
on
january
and
on
january
and
by
calculation
one
hundred
and
ten
years
ago
showed
that
in
one
hundred
years
ago
it
would
be
this
natural
straightening
is
of
course
going
on
and
we
are
merely
about
to
anticipate
it
when
this
improvement
was
mooted
all
agreed
that
the
extremes
of
heat
and
cold
could
well
be
spared
those
of
summer
against
those
of
winter
by
partially
straightening
the
axis
reduce
the
inclination
from
degrees
thirty
minutes
to
about
fifteen
degrees
but
let
us
stop
there
many
said
before
we
had
gone
far
however
we
found
it
would
be
best
to
make
the
work
complete
this
will
reclaim
and
make
productive
the
vast
areas
of
siberia
and
the
northern
part
of
this
continent
and
will
do
much
for
the
antarctic
regions
but
there
will
still
be
change
in
temperature
a
wind
blowing
towards
the
equator
will
always
be
colder
than
one
blowing
from
it
while
the
slight
eccentricity
of
the
orbit
will
supply
enough
change
to
awaken
recollections
of
seasons
in
our
eternal
spring
the
way
to
accomplish
this
is
to
increase
the
weight
of
the
pole
leaving
the
sun
by
increasing
the
amount
of
material
there
for
the
sun
to
attract
and
to
lighten
the
pole
approaching
or
turning
towards
the
sun
by
removing
some
heavy
substance
from
it
and
putting
it
preferably
at
the
opposite
pole
this
shifting
of
ballast
is
most
easily
accomplished
as
you
will
readily
perceive
by
confining
and
removing
water
which
is
easily
moved
and
has
a
considerable
weight
how
we
purpose
to
apply
these
aqueous
brakes
to
check
the
wabbling
of
the
earth
by
means
of
the
attraction
of
the
sun
you
will
now
see
from
commander
fillmore
of
the
arctic
shade
and
the
committee
on
bulkheads
and
dams
i
have
just
received
the
following
by
cable
telephone
arctic
ocean
is
now
in
condition
to
be
pumped
out
in
summer
and
to
have
its
average
depth
increased
one
hundred
feet
by
the
dams
in
winter
we
have
already
fifty
million
square
yards
of
windmill
turbine
surface
in
position
and
ready
to
move
the
cables
bringing
us
currents
from
the
dynamos
at
niagara
falls
are
connected
with
our
motors
and
those
from
the
tidal
dynamos
at
the
bay
of
fundy
will
be
in
contact
when
this
reaches
you
at
which
moment
the
pumps
will
begin
in
several
of
the
landlocked
gulfs
and
bays
our
system
of
confining
is
so
complete
that
the
surface
of
the
water
can
be
raised
two
hundred
feet
above
level
the
polar
bears
will
soon
have
to
use
artificial
ice
perhaps
the
cheers
now
ringing
without
may
reach
you
over
the
telephone
the
audience
became
greatly
interested
and
when
the
end
of
the
telephone
was
applied
to
a
microphone
the
room
fairly
rang
with
exultant
cheers
and
those
looking
through
a
kintograph
visual
telegraph
terminating
in
a
camera
obscura
on
the
shores
of
baffin
bay
were
able
to
see
engineers
and
workmen
waving
and
throwing
up
their
caps
and
falling
into
one
another
arms
in
ecstasies
of
delight
when
the
excitement
subsided
the
president
continued
chairman
wetmore
of
the
committee
on
excavations
and
embankments
in
wilkesland
and
the
antarctic
continent
reports
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
square
miles
are
now
hollowed
out
and
enclosed
sufficiently
to
hold
water
to
an
average
depth
of
four
hundred
feet
every
summer
when
the
basin
is
allowed
to
drain
we
can
if
necessary
extend
our
reservoir
and
shall
have
the
best
season
of
the
year
for
doing
work
until
the
earth
has
permanent
spring
though
we
have
comparatively
little
water
or
tidal
power
the
earth
crust
is
so
thin
at
this
latitude
on
account
of
the
flattening
that
by
sinking
our
tubular
boilers
and
pipes
to
a
depth
of
a
few
thousand
feet
we
have
secured
so
terrific
a
volume
of
superheated
steam
that
in
connection
with
our
wind
turbines
we
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
raising
half
a
cubic
mile
of
water
a
minute
to
our
enclosure
which
is
but
little
above
and
into
which
till
the
pressure
increases
we
can
fan
or
blow
the
water
so
that
it
can
be
full
three
weeks
after
our
longest
day
or
since
the
present
unimproved
arrangement
gives
the
indigenes
but
one
day
and
night
a
year
i
will
add
the
day
of
december
shall
be
able
to
find
use
for
much
of
the
potential
energy
of
the
water
in
the
reservoir
when
we
allow
it
to
escape
in
june
in
melting
some
of
the
accumulated
polar
thereby
decreasing
still
further
the
weight
of
this
pole
in
lighting
and
warming
ourselves
until
we
get
the
sun
light
and
heat
in
extending
the
excavations
and
in
charging
the
storage
batteries
of
the
ships
at
this
end
of
the
line
everything
will
be
ready
when
you
signal
raise
water
let
me
add
parenthetically
said
bearwarden
that
this
means
of
obtaining
power
by
steam
boilers
sunk
to
a
great
depth
is
much
to
be
commended
for
though
the
amount
of
heat
we
can
withdraw
is
too
small
to
have
much
effect
the
farther
towards
the
centre
our
globe
can
be
cooled
the
deeper
will
the
water
of
the
oceans
be
able
to
penetrate
since
it
is
its
conversion
into
steam
that
prevents
the
water
from
working
its
way
in
farther
and
the
more
dry
land
we
shall
have
you
see
the
president
continued
the
storage
capacity
at
the
south
pole
is
not
quite
as
great
as
at
the
north
because
it
is
more
difficult
to
excavate
a
basin
than
to
close
the
exits
of
one
that
already
exists
which
is
what
we
have
done
in
the
arctic
the
work
is
also
not
so
nearly
complete
since
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
use
the
southern
reservoir
for
storing
weight
for
six
months
or
until
the
south
pole
which
is
now
at
its
maximum
declination
from
the
sun
is
turned
towards
it
and
begins
to
move
away
then
by
increasing
the
amount
of
matter
there
and
at
the
same
time
lightening
the
north
pole
and
reversing
the
process
every
six
months
we
decrease
the
speed
at
which
the
departing
pole
leaves
the
sun
and
at
which
the
approaching
pole
advances
the
north
pole
we
see
will
be
a
somewhat
more
powerful
lever
than
the
south
for
working
the
globe
to
a
straight
position
but
we
may
be
sure
that
the
latter

connection
with
the
former
will
be
able
to
hold
up
its
end
the
building
here
fairly
shook
with
applause
so
that
had
the
arctic
workers
used
the
microphone
they
might
have
heard
in
the
enthusiastic
uproar
a
good
counterpart
of
their
own
period
i
only
regret
the
president
continued
that
when
we
began
this
work
the
most
marvellous
force
yet
discovered
apergy
was
not
sufficiently
understood
to
be
utilized
for
it
would
have
eased
our
labours
to
the
point
of
almost
eliminating
them
but
we
have
this
consolation
it
was
in
connection
with
our
work
that
its
applicability
was
discovered
so
that
had
we
and
all
others
postponed
our
great
undertaking
on
the
pretext
of
waiting
for
a
new
force
apergy
might
have
continued
to
lie
dormant
for
centuries
with
this
force
obtained
by
simply
blending
negative
and
positive
electricity
with
electricity
of
the
third
element
or
state
and
charging
a
body
sufficiently
with
this
fluid
gravitation
is
nullified
or
partly
reversed
and
the
earth
repels
the
body
with
the
same
or
greater
power
than
that
with
which
it
still
attracts
or
attracted
it
so
that
it
may
be
suspended
or
caused
to
move
away
into
space
sic
itur
ad
astra
we
may
say
with
this
force
and
everlasting
spring
before
us
what
may
we
not
achieve
we
may
some
day
be
able
to
visit
the
planets
though
many
may
say
that
since
the
axes
of
most
of
those
we
have
considered
are
more
inclined
than
ours
they
would
rather
stay
here
are
they
that
shall
inherit
the
earth
he
went
on
turning
a
globe
with
its
axis
set
vertically
and
at
right
angles
to
a
yellow
globe
labelled

and
again
waxing
eloquent
he
added
we
are
the
instruments
destined
to
bring
about
the
accomplishment
of
that
prophecy
for
never
in
the
history
of
the
world
has
man
reared
so
splendid
a
monument
to
his
own
genius
as
he
will
in
straightening
the
axis
of
the
planet
no
one
need
henceforth
be
troubled
by
sudden
change
and
every
man
can
have
perpetually
the
climate
he
desires
northern
europe
will
again
luxuriate
in
a
climate
that
favoured
the
elephants
that
roamed
in
northern
asia
and
switzerland
to
produce
these
animals
and
the
food
they
need
it
is
not
necessary
to
have
great
heat
but
merely
to
prevent
great
cold
half
the
summer
sun
being
absorbed
in
melting
the
winter
accumulation
of
ice
when
the
axis
has
reached
a
point
at
which
it
inclines
but
about
twelve
degrees
it
will
become
necessary
to
fill
the
antarctic
reservoir
in
june
and
the
arctic
ocean
in
december
in
order
to
check
the
straightening
since
otherwise
it
might
get
beyond
the
perpendicular
and
swing
the
other
way
when
this
motion
is
completely
arrested
i
suggest
that
we
blow
up
the
aleutian
isles
and
enlarge
bering
strait
so
as
to
allow
what
corresponds
to
the
atlantic
gulf
stream
in
the
pacific
to
enter
the
arctic
archipelago
which
i
have
calculated
will
raise
the
average
temperature
of
that
entire
region
about
thirty
degrees
thereby
still
further
increasing
the
amount
of
available
land
ocean
currents
being
the
result
of
the
prevailing
winds
which
will
be
more
regular
than
at
present
can
be
counted
upon
to
continue
practically
as
they
are
it
may
not
be
plain
to
you
why
the
trade
winds
do
not
blow
towards
the
equator
due
south
and
north
since
the
equator
has
much
the
same
effect
on
air
that
a
stove
has
in
the
centre
of
a
room
causing
an
ascending
current
towards
the
ceiling
which
moves
off
in
straight
lines
in
all
directions
on
reaching
it
its
place
being
taken
by
cold
currents
moving
in
opposite
directions
along
the
floor
picture
to
yourselves
the
ascending
currents
at
the
equator
moving
off
to
the
poles
from
which
they
came
as
they
move
north
they
are
continually
coming
to
parts
of
the
globe
having
smaller
circles
of
latitude
than
those
they
have
left
and
therefore
not
moved
forward
as
rapidly
by
the
earth
daily
rotation
as
the
latitudes
nearer
the
equator
the
winds
consequently
run
ahead
of
the
surface
and
so
move
east
of
north
the
earth
turning
towards
the
east
while
the
heavier
colder
surface
currents
rushing
towards
the
equator
to
take
the
place
of
the
ascending
column
coming
from
regions
where
the
surface
whirls
comparatively
slowly
to
those
where
it
is
rotating
faster
are
continually
left
behind
and
so
move
southwest
while
south
of
the
equator
a
corresponding
motion
results
though
this
is
not
the
most
exact
explanation
it
may
serve
to
make
the
action
clear
i
will
add
that
if
any
one
prefers
a
colder
or
a
warmer
climate
than
that
of
the
place
in
which
he
lives
he
need
only
go
north
or
south
for
an
hour
or
if
he
prefers
his
own
latitude
he
can
rise
a
few
thousand
feet
in
the
air
or
descend
to
one
of
the
which
are
now
used
as
sanitariums
and
secure
his
object
by
a
slight
change
of
altitude
let
us
speed
the
departure
of
racking
changes
and
extremes
of
climate
and
prepare
to
welcome
what
we
believe
prevails
in
paradise
namely

in

preparing
a
history
of
the
times
at
the
beginning
of
the
great
terrestrial
and
astronomical
change
wrote
as
follows
this
period
is
by
far
the
most
wonderful
the
world
has
as
yet
seen
the
advance
in
scientific
knowledge
and
attainment
within
the
memory
of
the
present
generation
has
been
so
stupendous
that
it
completely
overshadows
all
that
has
preceded
all
times
in
history
and
all
periods
of
the
world
have
been
remarkable
for
some
distinctive
or
characteristic
trait
the
feature
of
the
period
of
louis
xiv
was
the
splendour
of
the
court
and
the
centralization
of
power
in
paris
the
year
marked
the
decline
of
the
power
of
courts
and
the
evolution
of
government
by
the
people
so
by
the
spread
of
republican
ideas
and
the
great
advance
in
science
education
has
become
universal
for
women
as
well
as
for
men
and
this
is
more
than
ever
a
mechanical
age
with
increased
knowledge
we
are
constantly
coming
to
realize
how
little
we
really
know
and
are
also
continually
finding
manifestations
of
forces
that
at
first
seem
like
exceptions
to
established
laws
this
is
of
course
brought
about
by
the
modifying
influence
of
some
other
natural
law
though
many
of
these
we
have
not
yet
discovered
electricity
in
its
varied
forms
does
all
work
having
superseded
animal
and
manual
labour
in
everything
and
man
has
only
to
direct
the
greatest
ingenuity
next
to
finding
new
uses
for
this
almost
omnipotent
fluid
has
been
displayed
in
inducing
the
forces
of
nature
and
even
the
sun
to
produce
it
before
describing
the
features
of
this
perfection
of
civilization
let
us
review
the
steps
by
which
society
and
the
political
world
reached
their
present
state
at
the
close
of
the
war
in
continental
europe
entered
upon
the
condition
of
an
armed
camp
which
lasted
for
nearly
half
a
century
the
primary
cause
of
this
was
the
mutual
dislike
and
jealousy
of
france
and
germany
each
of
which
strove
to
have
a
larger
and
better
equipped
national
defence
than
the
other
there
were
also
many
other
causes
as
the
ambition
of
the
russian
czar
supported
by
his
country
vast
though
imperfectly
developed
resources
and
practically
unlimited
supply
of
men
one
phase
of
which
was
the
constant
ferment
in
the
balkan
peninsula
and
another
russia
schemes
for
extension
in
asia
another
was
the
general
desire
for
colonies
in
africa
in
which
one
continental
power
pretty
effectually
blocked
another
and
the
latent
distrust
inside
the
triple
alliance
england
meanwhile
preserved
a
wise
and
profitable
neutrality
these
tremendous
sacrifices
for
armaments
both
on
land
and
water
had
results
and
as
we
see
it
now
were
clouds
with
silver
linings
the
demand
for
hardened
steel
projectiles
plates
and
light
and
almost
unbreakable
machinery
was
a
great
incentive
to
improvement
in
metallurgy
while
the
necessity
for
compact
and
safely
carried
ammunition
greatly
stimulated
chemical
research
and
led
to
the
discovery
of
explosives
whose
powers
no
obstacle
can
resist
and
incidentally
to
other
more
useful
things
further
mechanical
and
scientific
progress
however
such
as
flying
machines
provided
with
these
high
explosives
and
asphyxiating
bombs
containing
compressed
gas
that
could
be
fired
from
guns
or
dropped
from
the
air
intervened
the
former
would
have
laid
every
city
in
the
dust
and
the
latter
might
have
almost
exterminated
the
race
these
discoveries
providentially
prevented
hostilities
so
that
the
war
so
long
expected
never
came
and
the
rival
nations
had
their
pains
for
nothing
or
rather
for
others
than
themselves
let
us
now
examine
the
political
and
ethnological
results
hundreds
of
thousands
of
the
flower
of
continental
europe
were
killed
by
overwork
and
short
rations
and
millions
of
desirable
and
often
unfortunately
for
us
undesirable
people
were
driven
to
emigration
nearly
all
of
whom
came
to
territory
greatly
increasing
our
productiveness
and
power
as
we
have
seen
the
jealousy
of
the
continental
powers
for
one
another
effectually
prevented
their
extending
their
influence
or
protectorates
to
other
continents
which
jealousy
was
considerably
aided
by
the
small
but
destructive
wars
that
did
take
place
high
taxes
also
made
it
more
difficult
for
the
moneyed
men
to
invest
in
colonizing
or
development
companies
which
are
so
often
the
forerunners
of
absorption
while
the
united
states
with
her
coal
of
which
the
mediterranean
states
have
scarcely
any
other
resources
and
low
taxes
which
though
necessary
can
be
nothing
but
an
evil
has
been
able
to
expand
naturally
as
no
other
nation
ever
has
before
this
has
given
the
especially
the
united
states
a
free
hand
rendering
enforcement
of
the
monroe
doctrine
easy
and
started
english
a
long
way
towards
becoming
the
universal
language
while
all
formerly
unoccupied
land
is
now
owned
by
those
speaking
it
at
the
close
of
our
civil
war
in
we
had
but
square
miles
and
a
population
of
the
country
staggered
beneath
a
colossal
debt
of
over
had
an
expensive
but
essentially
perishable
navy
and
there
was
an
ominous
feeling
between
the
sections
the
purchase
of
alaska
in
by
which
we
added
over
half
a
million
square
miles
to
our
territory
marked
the
resumption
of
the
forward
march
of
the
united
states
years
later
at
the
presidential
campaign
of
the
debt
had
been
reduced
to
deducting
the
sinking
fund
and
the
charge
for
pensions
had
about
reached
its
maximum
and
soon
began
to
decrease
though
no
one
objected
to
any
amount
of
reward
for
bona
fide
soldiers
who
had
helped
to
save
the
country
the
country
wealth
had
also
enormously
increased
while
the
population
had
grown
to
our
ancestors
had
completed
or
in
building
a
navy
of
which
no
nation
need
be
ashamed
and
though
occasionally
marred
by
hard
times
there
was
general
prosperity
gradually
the
different
states
of
canada
or
provinces
as
they
were
then
called
came
to
realize
that
their
future
would
be
far
grander
and
more
glorious
in
union
with
the
united
states
than
separated
from
it
and
also
that
their
sympathy
was
far
stronger
for
their
nearest
neighbours
than
for
any
one
else
one
by
one
these
northern
states
made
known
their
desire
for
consolidation
with
the
union
retaining
complete
control
of
their
local
affairs
as
have
the
older
states
they
were
gladly
welcomed
by
our
government
and
people
and
possible
rivals
became
the
best
of
friends
preceding
and
also
following
this
the
states
of
mexico
central
america
and
parts
of
south
america
tiring
of
the
incessant
revolutions
and
difficulties
among
themselves
which
had
pretty
constantly
looked
upon
us
as
a
big
brother
on
account
of
our
maintenance
of
the
monroe
doctrine
began
to
agitate
for
annexation
knowing
they
would
retain
control
of
their
local
affairs
in
this
they
were
vigorously
supported
by
the
american
residents
and
who
knew
that
their
possessions
would
double
in
value
the
day
the
united
states
constitution
was
signed
thus
in
the
first
place
by
the
encouragement
of
our
people
and
latterly
apparently
by
its
own
volition
the
union
has
increased
enormously
in
power
till
it
now
embraces
square
miles
and
has
a
free
and
enlightened
population
of
though
the
union
established
by
washington
and
his
contemporaries
has
attained
such
tremendous
proportions
its
growth
is
by
no
means
finished
and
as
a
result
of
modern
improvements
it
is
less
of
a
journey
now
to
go
from
alaska
to
the
orinoco
than
it
was
for
the
father
of
his
country
to
travel
from
new
york
or
philadelphia
to
the
site
of
the
city
named
in
his
honour
adequate
and
really
rapid
transportation
facilities
have
done
much
to
bind
the
different
parts
of
the
country
together
and
to
rub
off
the
edges
of
local
prejudice
though
we
always
favour
peace
no
nation
would
think
of
opposing
the
expressed
wishes
of
the
united
states
and
our
moral
power
for
good
is
tremendous
the
name
japhet
means
enlargement
and
the
prophecy
seems
about
to
be
literally
fulfilled
by
these
his
descendants
the
bankrupt
suffering
of
so
many
european
continental
powers
had
also
other
results
it
enabled
the
socialists
who
have
never
been
able
to
see
beyond
themselves
to
force
their
governments
into
selling
their
colonies
in
the
eastern
hemisphere
to
england
and
their
islands
in
the
western
to
us
in
order
to
realize
upon
them
with
the
addition
of
canada
to
the
united
states
and
its
loss
to
the
british
empire
the
land
possessions
of
the
two
powers
became
about
equal
our
union
being
a
trifle
the
larger
all
danger
of
war
being
removed
by
the
canadian
change
a
healthful
and
friendly
competition
took
its
place
the
nations
competing
in
their
growth
on
different
hemispheres
england
easily
added
large
areas
in
asia
and
africa
while
the
united
states
grew
as
we
have
seen
the
race
is
still
in
a
sense
and
the
together
possess
nearly
half
the
globe
the
world
recent
rate
of
progress
would
have
been
impossible
without
this
approximation
to
a
universal
language
the
causes
that
checkmated
the
continental
powers
have
ceased
to
exist
many
millions
of
men
whose
principal
thought
had
been
to
destroy
other
members
of
the
race
became
producers
but
it
was
then
too
late
for
the
heavy
armaments
had
done
their
work
let
us
now
glance
at
the
times
as
they
are
and
see
how
the
business
of
life
is
transacted
manhattan
island
has
something
over
inhabitants
and
is
surrounded
by
a
belt
of
population
several
miles
wide
of
more
of
which
it
is
the
focus
so
that
the
entire
city
contains
more
than
souls
the
several
hundred
square
miles
of
land
and
water
forming
greater
new
york
are
perfectly
united
by
numerous
bridges
tunnels
and
electric
ferries
while
the
city
great
natural
advantages
have
been
enhanced
and
beautified
by
every
ingenious
device
no
main
avenue
in
the
newer
sections
is
less
than
two
hundred
feet
wide
containing
shade
and
fruit
trees
a
broad
sidewalks
and
open
spaces
for
carriages
and
bicycles
several
fine
diagonal
streets
and
have
also
been
provided
in
the
older
sections
and
the
existing
parks
have
been
supplemented
by
intermediate
ones
all
being
connected
by
parkways
to
form
continuous
chains
the
hollow
masts
of
our
ships
to
glance
at
another
phase
en
passant
carry
windmills
instead
of
sails
through
which
the
wind
performs
the
work
of
storing
a
great
part
of
the
energy
required
to
run
them
at
sea
while
they
are
discharging
or
loading
cargo
in
port
and
it
can
of
course
work
to
better
advantage
while
they
are
stationary
than
when
they
are
running
before
it
these
turbines
are
made
entirely
of
light
metal
and
fold
when
not
in
use
so
that
only
the
frames
are
visible
sometimes
these
also
fold
and
are
housed
or
wholly
disappear
within
the
mast
are
also
placed

to

had

that
it

while
north

as
the

the
rabbits
in

and
the

more
objectionable
poisonous

in

and

have
been
exterminated
by
the
capture
of
a

of

in

their
inoculation
with
the
virus
similar
to
the

tuberculosis
or
any
other

to
which
the
species
treated
was
particularly
susceptible
and
the

of
these

the
disease
was
seen
to
be
taking

the
rabbits
and
serpents
released
at
once
returned
to
their
old
haunts
carrying
the
plague
far
and
wide
the
unfortunate
rabbits
were
greatly
commiserated
even
by
the
medicos
that
wielded
the
syringe
but
fortunately
for
themselves
they
died
easily
the
reptiles
perhaps
on
account
of
the
wider
distribution
of
the
nerve
centres
had
more
lingering
but
not
painful
deaths
often
while
in
articulo
mortis
leaving
the
holes
with
which
they
seemed
to
connect
their
discomfort
and
making
a
final
struggle
along
the
ground
only
to
die
more
quickly
as
a
result
of
their
exertions
we
have
applied
this
also
to
the
locust
and
other
insect
pests
no

being
too
small

the
ubiquitous

which
properly
cultivated

we
have
microbe

that
show
us
as
unmistakably
whether
the
germs
of
any
particular
disease
like
malaria
typhoid
or
scarlet
fever
are
present
in
the
air
as
shows
alkalinity
of
a
solution
we
also
inoculate
as
a
preventive
against
these
and
almost
all
other
germ
diseases
with
the
same
success
that
we
vaccinate
for
smallpox
the
medicinal
properties
of
all
articles
of
food
are
so
well
understood
also
that
most
cures
are
brought
about
simply
by
dieting
this
reminds
me
of
the
mistakes
perpetrated
on
a
friend
of
mine
who
called
in
one
of
the
physicians
to
be
treated
for
insomnia
and
dyspepsia
this
old
numskull
restricted
his
diet
gave
him
huge
doses
of
medicine
and
decided
most
learnedly
that
he
was
daily
growing
worse
concluding
that
he
had
but
a
short
time
to
live
my
friend
threw
away
the
nauseating
medicines
ate
whatever
he
had
a
natural
desire
for
and
was
soon
as
well
as
ever
the
obvious
moral
of
which
is
that
we
can
get
whatever
treatment
we
need
most
beneficially
from
our
food
our
physicians
are
most
serious
and
thoughtful
men
they
never
claim
to
be
infallible
but
study
scientifically
to
increase
their
knowledge
and
improve
the
methods
of
treatment
as
a
result
of
this
fresh
air
regular
exercise
for
both
sexes
with
better
conditions
and
the
preservation
of
the
lives
of
children
that
formerly
died
by
thousands
from
preventable
causes
the
physique
especially
of
women
is
wonderfully
improved
and
the
average
longevity
is
already
over
sixty
our
social
structure
to
be
brief
is
based
on
science
or
the
conservation
of
energy
as
the
greek
philosophers
predicted
it
was
known
to
them
that
a
certain
amount
of
power
would
produce
only
a
certain
amount
of
work
that
is
the
weight
of
a
clock
in
descending
or
a
spring
in
uncoiling
returns
theoretically
the
amount
of
work
expended
in
raising
or
coiling
it
and
in
no
possible
way
can
it
do
more
in
practice
on
account
of
friction
we
know
it
does
less
this
law
being
invariable
of
course
limits
us
as
it
did
archimedes
and
pythagoras
we
have
simply
utilized
sources
of
power
that
their
clumsy
workmen
allowed
to
escape
of
the
four
principal
sources
food
fuel
wind
and
tide
including
harnessed
waterfalls
the
last
two
do
by
far
the
most
work
much
of
the
electrical
energy
in
every
thunderstorm
is
also
captured
and
condensed
in
our
capacious
storage
batteries
as
natural
hygeia
in
the
form
of
rain
was
and
is
still
caught
in
our
country
cisterns
every
exposed
place
is
crowned
by
a
cluster
of
huge
windmills
that
lift
water
to
some
pond
or
reservoir
placed
as
high
as
possible
every
stiff
breeze
therefore
raises
millions
of
tons
of
water
which
operate
hydraulic
turbines
as
required
incidentally
these
storage
reservoirs
by
increasing
the
surface
exposed
to
evaporation
and
the
consequent
rainfall
have
a
very
beneficial
effect
on
the
dry
regions
in
the
interior
of
the
continent
and
in
some
cases
have
almost
superseded
irrigation
the
windmill
and
dynamo
thus
utilize
bleak
that
till
their
discovery
seemed
to
be
but
indifferent
successes
in
dame
nature
domain
the
electricity
generated
by
these
in
connection
with
that
obtained
by
waterfalls
tidal
dynamos
thunderstorms
chemical
action
and
steam
engines
provides
the
power
required
to
run
our
electric
ships
and
railways
and
stationary
and
portable
motors
for
heating
the
cables
laid
along
the
bottom
of
our
canals
to
prevent
their
freezing
in
winter
and
for
almost
every
conceivable
purpose
sometimes
a
man
has
a
windmill
on
his
roof
for
light
and
heat
then
the
harder
the
wintry
blasts
may
blow
the
brighter
and
warmer
becomes
the
house
the
current
passing
through
a
storage
battery
to
make
it
more
steady
the
operation
of
our
ordinary
electric
railways
is
very
simple
the
current
is
taken
from
an
overhead
side
or
underneath
wire
directly
through
the
air
without
the
intervention
of
a
trolley
and
the
fast
cars
for
they
are
no
longer
run
in
trains
make
five
miles
a
minute
the
entire
weight
of
each
car
being
used
for
its
own
traction
it
can
ascend
very
steep
grades
and
can
attain
high
speed
or
stop
very
quickly
another
form
is
the
magnetic
railway
on
which
the
cars
are
at
both
ends
and
moved
by
huge
magnets
weighing
four
thousand
tons
each
placed
fifty
miles
apart
on
passing
a
magnet
the
nature
of
the
electricity
charging
a
car
is
automatically
changed
from
positive
to
negative
or
vice
versa
to
that
of
the
magnet
just
passed
so
that
it
repels
while
the
next
attracts
the
successive
magnets
are
charged
oppositely
the
sections
being
divided
halfway
between
by
insulators
the
nature
of
the
electricity
in
each
section
being
governed
by
the
charge
in
the
magnet
to
prevent
one
kind
of
electricity
from
uniting
with
and
neutralizing
that
in
the
next
section
by
passing
through
the
car
at
the
moment
of
transit
there
is
a
dead
stretch
of
fifty
yards
with
rails
not
charged
at
all
between
the
sections
this
change
in
the
nature
of
the
electricity
is
repeated
automatically
every
fifty
miles
and
obviates
the
necessity
of
revolving
machinery
the
rails
aiding
communication
magnetism
being
practically
as
instantaneous
as
gravitation
the
only
limitations
to
speed
are
the
electrical
pressure
at
the
magnets
the
resistance
of
the
air
and
the
danger
of
the
wheels
bursting
from
centrifugal
force
the
first
can
seemingly
be
increased
without
limit
the
atmospheric
resistance
is
about
to
be
reduced
by
running
the
cars
hermetically
sealed
through
a
partial
vacuum
in
a
steel
and
toughened
glass
tube
while
the
third
has
been
removed
indefinitely
by
the
use
of
galvanized
aluminum
which
bears
about
the
same
relation
to
ordinary
aluminum
that
steel
does
to
iron
and
which
has
twice
the
tensile
strength
and
but
one
third
the
weight
of
steel
in
some
cases
the
rails
are
made
turned
in
so
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
a
car
to
leave
the
track
without
the
being
totally
demolished
but
in
most
cases
this
is
found
to
be
unnecessary
for
no
through
line
has
a
curve
on
its
vast
stretches
with
a
radius
of
less
than
half
a
mile
rails
one
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
to
the
yard
are
set
in
grooved
steel
ties
which
in
turn
are
held
by
a
concrete
consisting
of
broken
stone
and
cement
making
spreading
rails
and
loose
ballast
impossible
a
large
increase
in
capital
was
necessary
for
these
improvements
the
elimination
of
curves
being
the
most
laborious
part
requiring
bridges
cuttings
and
embankments
that
dwarf
the
pyramids
and
would
have
made
the
ancient
pharaohs
open
their
eyes
but
with
the
low
rate
of
interest
on
bonds
the
slight
cost
of
power
and
great
increase
in
business
the
venture
was
a
success
and
we
are
now
in
sight
of
further
advances
that
will
enable
a
traveller
in
a
high
latitude
moving
west
to
keep
pace
with
the
sun
and
should
he
wish
it
to
have
unending
day
chapter
cortlandt
history
continued
in
marine
transportation
we
have
two
methods
one
for
freight
and
another
for
passengers
the
deeply
immersed
ship
has
not
changed
radically
from
the
steam
and
sailing
vessels
of
the
last
century
except
that
electricity
has
superseded
all
other
motive
powers
steamers
gradually
passed
through
the
five
six
and
seven
class
with
other
dimensions
in
proportion
till
their
length
exceeded
one
thousand
feet
these
were
very
fast
ships
crossing
the
atlantic
in
four
and
a
half
days
and
were
almost
as
steady
as
houses
in
even
the
roughest
weather
ships
at
this
period
of
their
development
had
also
passed
through
the
twin
and
triple
screw
stage
to
the
quadruple
all
four
together
developing
one
hundred
and
forty
thousand
indicated
and
being
driven
by
steam
this
of
course
involved
sacrificing
the
best
part
of
the
ship
to
her
engines
and
a
very
heavy
idle
investment
while
in
port
storage
batteries
with
plates
composed
of
lead
or
iron
constantly
increasing
in
size
had
reached
a
fair
state
of
development
by
the
close
of
the
nineteenth
century
during
the
second
decade
of
the
twentieth
century
the
engineers
decided
to
try
the
plan
of
running
half
of
a
transatlantic
liner
screws
by
electricity
generated
by
the
engines
for
driving
the
others
while
the
ship
was
in
port
this
having
been
a
success
already
on
a
smaller
scale
for
a
time
this
plan
gave
great
satisfaction
since
it
diminished
the
amount
of
coal
to
be
carried
and
the
consequent
change
of
displacement
at
sea
and
enabled
the
ship
to
be
worked
with
a
smaller
number
of
men
the
batteries
could
also
of
course
be
distributed
along
the
entire
length
and
placed
where
space
was
least
valuable
the
construction
of
such
huge
vessels
called
for
much
governmental
river
and
harbour
dredging
and
a
ship
drawing
feet
can
now
enter
new
york
at
any
state
of
the
tide
for
ocean
bars
the
old
system
of
taking
the
material
out
to
sea
and
discharging
it
still
survives
though
a
jet
of
water
from
directed
against
the
obstruction
is
also
often
employed
with
quick
results
for
river
work
we
have
discovered
a
better
method
all
the
mud
is
run
back
sometimes
over
a
mile
from
the
river
bank
where
it
is
used
as
a
fertilizer
by
means
of
wire
railways
strung
from
poles
these
wire
cables
combine
in
themselves
the
functions
of
trolley
wire
and
steel
rail
and
carry
the
suspended
cars
which
empty
themselves
and
return
around
the
loop
for
another
load
often
the
removed
material
entirely
fills
small
valleys
or
low
places
in
which
case
it
can
not
wash
back
this
improvement
has
ended
the
necessity
of
building
jetties
the
next
improvement
in
sea
travelling
was
the
spider
as
the
name
shows
this
is
built
on
the
principle
of
an
insect
it
is
well
known
that
a
body
can
be
carried
over
the
water
much
faster
than
through
it
with
this
in
mind
builders
at
first
constructed
light
framework
decks
on
large
wheels
or
drums
having
paddles
on
their
circumferences
to
provide
a
hold
on
the
water
these
they
caused
to
revolve
by
means
of
machinery
on
the
deck
but
soon
found
that
the
resistance
offered
to
the
barrel
wheels
themselves
was
too
great
they
therefore
made
them
more
like
centipeds
with
large
feet
connected
with
a
superstructural
deck
by
pipes
through
which
when
necessary
a
pressure
of
air
can
be
forced
down
upon
the
enclosed
surface
of
water
ordinarily
however
they
go
at
great
speed
without
this
the
weight
of
the
water
displaced
by
the
bell
feet
being
as
great
as
that
resting
upon
them
thus
they
swing
along
like
a
pacing
horse
except
that
there
are
four
rows
of
feet
instead
of
two
each
foot
being
taken
out
of
the
water
as
it
is
swung
forward
the
first
and
fourth
and
second
and
third
rows
being
worked
together
although
on
account
of
their
size
which
covers
several
acres
they
can
go
in
any
water
they
give
the
best
results
on
mediterraneans
and
lakes
that
are
free
from
ocean
rollers
and
under
favourable
conditions
make
better
speed
than
the
express
trains
and
of
course
going
straight
as
the
crow
flies
and
without
stopping
they
reach
a
destination
in
considerably
shorter
time
some
passengers
and
express
packages
still
cross
the
atlantic
on
but
most
of
these
light
cargoes
go
in
a
far
pleasanter
and
more
rapid
way
the
vessels
for
heavy
freight
make
little
better
speed
than
was
made
by
the
same
class
a
hundred
years
ago
but
they
are
also
run
entirely
by
electricity
largely
supplied
by
wind
and
by
the
tide
turning
their
motors
which
become
dynamos
while
at
anchor
in
any
stream
they
therefore
need
no
bulky
boilers
engines
sails
or
and
consequently
can
carry
unprecedentedly
large
cargoes
with
comparatively
small
crews
the
officers
on
the
bridge
and
the
men
in
the
crow
nest
the
way
to
which
is
by
a
ladder
inside
the
mast
to
protect
the
climber
from
the
weather
are
about
all
that
is
needed
while
disablement
is
made
practically
impossible
by
having
four
screws
each
with
its
own
set
of
automatically
lubricating
motors
this
change
like
other
appliances
at
first
resulted
in
laying
off
a
good
many
men
the
least
satisfactory
being
the
first
to
go
but
the
increase
in
business
was
so
great
that
the
intelligent
men
were
soon
reemployed
as
officers
at
higher
rates
of
pay
and
more
interesting
work
than
before
while
they
as
consumers
were
benefited
as
much
as
any
one
else
by
the
decreased
cost
of
production
and
transportation
with
a
view
to
facilitating
interchange
still
further
our
government
has
gradually
completed
the
double
that
nature
gave
us
in
part
this
was
done
by
connecting
islands
separated
from
shore
by
navigable
water
and
leaving
openings
for
ingress
and
exit
but
a
few
hundred
yards
wide
the
breakwaters
required
to
do
this
were
built
with
cribbing
of
incorrodible
metal
affixed
to
deeply
driven
metallic
piles
and
filled
with
stones
along
coasts
where
they
were
found
in
abundance
or
excess
this
while
clearing
many
fields
and
improving
them
for
cultivation
provided
just
the
needed
material
since
irregular
stones
bind
together
firmly
and
while
also
insoluble
combine
considerable
bulk
with
weight
south
of
hatteras
where
stones
are
scarce
the
sand
dredged
from
parts
of
the
channel
was
filled
into
the
crib
the
surface
of
which
has
a
concave
metallic
cover
a
trough
of
still
water
being
often
the
best
barrier
against
the
passage
of
waves
this
double
has
been
a
great
benefit
and
propelled
vessels
of
moderate
draught
can
range
in
smooth
water
carrying
very
full
loads
from
labrador
to
the
orinoco
the
exits
are
of
course
protected
by
a
line
of
cribbing
a
few
hundred
feet
to
seaward
the
rocks
have
been
removed
from
all
channels
about
new
york
and
other
commercial
centres
while
the
shallow
places
have
been
dredged
to
a
uniform
depth
this
diminishes
the
dangers
of
navigation
and
considerably
decreases
the
speed
with
which
the
tides
rush
through
where
the
obstructions
consisted
of
reefs
surrounded
by
deep
water
their
removal
with
explosives
was
easy
the
shattered
fragments
being
allowed
to
sink
to
the
bottom
and
remain
there
beneath
the
danger
line
many
other
great
works
have
also
been
completed
the
canals
at
nicaragua
have
been
in
operation
many
years
it
having
been
found
best
to
have
several
sizes
of
locks
and
to
use
the
large
ones
only
for
the
passage
of
large
vessels
the
improved
erie
and
champlain
canals
also
enable
ships
four
hundred
feet
long
to
reach
new
york
from
the
great
lakes
via
the
hudson
river
for
flying
we
have
an
aeroplane
that
came
in
when
we
devised
a
suitable
motor
power
this
is
obtained
from
very
light
batteries
that
combine
some
qualities
of
the
primary
and
secondary
type
since
they
must
first
be
charged
from
a
dynamo
after
which
they
can
supply
full
currents
for
one
hundred
hours
enough
to
take
them
around
the
globe
while
partly
consuming
the
elements
in
the
cells
the
power
is
applied
through
turbine
screws
half
of
which
are
capable
of
propelling
the
flat
deck
in
its
inclined
position
at
sufficient
speed
to
prevent
its
falling
the
moving
parts
have
ball
bearings
and
friction
rollers
lubrication
being
secured
automatically
when
required
by
a
supply
of
vaseline
that
melts
if
any
part
becomes
hot
all
the
framing
is
of
thin
but
very
durable
galvanized
aluminum
which
has
superseded
steel
for
every
purpose
in
which
weight
is
not
an
advantage
as
in
the
permanent
way
on
railways
the
air
ships
whose
length
varies
from
fifty
to
five
hundred
feet
have
rudders
for
giving
a
vertical
or
a
horizontal
motion
and
several
strengthening
keels
that
prevent
leeway
when
turning
they
are
entirely
on
the
principle
of
birds
maintaining
themselves
mechanically
and
differing
thus
from
the
unwieldy
balloon
starting
as
if
on
a
circular
railway
against
the
wind
they
rise
to
a
considerable
height
and
then
shutting
off
the
batteries
coast
down
the
aerial
slope
at
a
rate
that
sometimes
touches
five
hundred
miles
an
hour
when
near
the
ground
the
helmsman
directs
the
prow
upward
and
again
turning
on
full
current
rushes
up
the
slope
at
a
speed
that
far
exceeds
the
eagle
each
drop
of
two
miles
serving
to
take
the
machine
twenty
or
thirty
though
if
the
pilot
does
not
wish
to
soar
or
if
there
is
a
fair
wind
at
a
given
height
he
can
remain
in
that
stratum
of
the
atmosphere
by
moving
horizontally
he
can
also
maintain
his
elevation
when
moving
very
slowly
and
though
the
headway
be
entirely
stopped
the
descent
is
gradual
on
account
of
the
aeroplane
great
spread
the
batteries
and
motors
being
secured
to
the
under
side
of
the
deck
the
motors
are
so
light
that
they
develop
two
horse
power
for
every
pound
of
their
weight
while
to
keep
the
frames
thin
the
necessary
power
is
obtained
by
terrific
speed
of
the
moving
parts
as
though
a
steam
engine
to
avoid
great
pressure
in
its
cylinders
had
a
long
stroke
and
ran
at
great
piston
speed
which
however
is
no
disadvantage
to
the
rotary
motion
of
the
electric
motor
there
being
no
reciprocating
cranks
that
must
be
started
and
stopped
at
each
revolution
to
obviate
the
necessity
of
gearing
to
reduce
the
number
of
revolutions
to
those
possible
for
a
large
screw
this
member
is
made
very
small
and
allowed
to
revolve
three
thousand
times
a
minute
so
that
the
requisite
power
is
obtained
with
great
simplicity
of
mechanism
which
further
decreases
friction
the
shafts
and
even
the
wires
connecting
the
batteries
with
the
motors
are
made
large
and
hollow
though
the
primary
battery
pure
and
simple
as
the
result
of
great
recent
advances
in
chemistry
seems
to
be
again
coming
up
the
best
aeroplane
batteries
are
still
of
the
storage
type
these
have
been
so
perfected
that
eight
ounces
of
battery
yield
one
horse
power
for
six
hours
so
that
two
pounds
of
battery
will
supply
a
horse
power
for
hours
a
small
aeroplane
being
therefore
able
to
fly
four
days
with
a
battery
weight
of
but
four
hundred
pounds
limestone
and
clarified
acid
are
the
principal
parts
of
these
batteries
it
was
known
long
ago
that
there
was
about
as
much
imprisoned
solar
energy
in
limestone
as
in
coal
but
it
was
only
recently
that
we
discovered
this
way
of
releasing
and
using
it
common
salt
plays
an
important
part
in
many
of
our
chemical
reactions
by
combining
it
with
limestone
and
treating
this
with
acid
jelly
we
also
get
good
results
on
raising
to
the
however
enjoyable
the
manly
sport
of
yachting
is
on
water
how
vastly
more
interesting
and
fascinating
it
is
for
a
man
to
have
a
yacht
in
which
he
can
fly
to
europe
in
one
day
and
with
which
the
exploration
of
tropical
africa
or
the
regions
about
the
poles
is
mere
child
play
while
giving
him
so
magnificent
a
view
many
seemingly
insoluble
problems
are
solved
by
the
advent
of
these
birds
having
as
their
halo
the
enforcement
of
peace
they
have
in
truth
taken
us
a
long
step
towards
heaven
and
to
the
and
higher
civilization
that
followed
we
shall
owe
much
of
the
success
of
the
great
experiment
on
mother
earth
now
about
to
be
tried
another
change
that
came
in
with
a
rush
upon
the
discovery
of
a
battery
with
insignificant
weight
compact
form
and
great
capacity
was
the
substitution
of
electricity
for
animal
power
for
the
movement
of
all
vehicles
this
of
necessity
brought
in
good
roads
the
results
obtainable
on
such
being
so
much
greater
than
on
bad
ones
that
a
universal
demand
for
them
arose
this
was
in
a
sense
cumulative
since
the
better
the
streets
and
roads
became
the
greater
the
inducement
to
have
an
electric
carriage
the
work
of
opening
up
the
country
far
and
near
by
straightening
and
improving
existing
roads
and
laying
out
new
ones
that
combine
the
solidity
of
the
appian
way
with
the
smoothness
of
modern
asphalt
was
largely
done
by
convicts
working
under
the
direction
of
state
and
government
engineers
every
state
contained
a
horde
of
these
unprofitable
boarders
who
as
they
formerly
worked
interfered
with
honest
labour
and
when
idle
got
into
trouble
city
streets
had
been
paved
by
the
municipality
country
roads
attended
to
by
the
farmers
usually
very
unscientifically
here
was
a
field
in
which
convict
labour
would
not
compete
and
an
important
work
could
be
done
when
once
this
was
made
the
law
every
year
showed
improvement
while
the
convicts
had
useful
and
healthful
occupation
the
electric
phaetons
as
those
for
high
speed
are
called
have
three
and
four
wheels
and
weigh
including
battery
and
motor
five
hundred
to
four
thousand
pounds
with
hollow
but
immensely
strong
galvanically
treated
aluminum
frames
and
pneumatic
or
cushion
tires
they
run
at
and
forty
miles
an
hour
on
country
roads
and
attain
a
speed
over
forty
on
city
streets
and
can
maintain
this
rate
without
recharging
for
several
days
they
can
therefore
roam
over
the
roads
of
the
entire
hemisphere
from
the
fertile
valley
of
the
peace
and
grey
shores
of
hudson
bay
to
beautiful
lake
nicaragua
the
river
plate
and
patagonia
improving
man
by
bringing
him
close
to
nature
while
they
combine
the
sensations
of
coasting
with
the
interest
of
seeing
the
country
well
to
recharge
the
batteries
which
can
be
done
in
almost
every
town
and
village
two
copper
pins
attached
to
insulated
copper
wires
are
shoved
into
holes
these
drop
out
of
themselves
by
fusing
a
small
lead
ribbon
owing
to
the
increased
resistance
when
the
acid
in
the
batteries
begins
to
though
there
is
of
course
but
little
heat
in
this
the
function
of
charging
being
merely
to
bring
about
the
condition
in
which
part
of
the
limestone
can
be
consumed
the
batteries
themselves
when
in
constant
use
requiring
to
be
renewed
about
once
a
month
a
handle
at
the
box
seat
turns
on
any
part
of
the
attainable
current
for
either
going
ahead
or
reversing
there
being
six
or
eight
degrees
of
speed
for
both
directions
while
the
steering
is
done
with
a
small
wheel
light
but
powerful
batteries
and
motors
have
also
been
fitted
on
bicycles
which
can
act
either
as
auxiliaries
for
or
in
case
of
head
wind
or
they
can
propel
the
machine
altogether
gradually
the
width
of
the
streets
became
insufficient
for
the
traffic
although
the
elimination
of
horses
and
the
consequent
increase
in
speed
greatly
augmented
their
carrying
capacity
until
recently
a
new
system
came
in
the
whole
width
of
the
avenues
and
streets
in
the
business
parts
of
the
city
including
the
former
sidewalks
is
given
up
to
wheel
traffic
an
iron
ridge
extending
along
the
exact
centre
to
compel
vehicles
to
keep
to
the
right
strips
of
nickel
painted
white
and
showing
a
bright
phosphorescence
at
night
are
let
into
the
metal
pavement
flush
with
the
surface
and
run
parallel
to
this
ridge
at
distances
of
ten
to
fifteen
feet
dividing
each
half
of
the
avenue
into
four
or
five
sections
their
width
increasing
as
they
approach
the
middle
all
trucks
or
drays
moving
at
less
than
seven
miles
an
hour
are
obliged
to
keep
in
the
section
nearest
the
building
line
those
running
between
seven
and
fifteen
in
the
next
fifteen
to
in
the
third
to
in
the
fourth
and
everything
faster
than
that
in
the
section
next
the
ridge
unless
the
avenue
or
street
is
wide
enough
for
further
subdivisions
if
it
is
wide
enough
for
only
four
or
less
the
fastest
vehicles
must
keep
next
the
middle
and
limit
their
speed
to
the
rate
allowed
in
that
section
which
is
marked
at
every
crossing
in
white
letters
sufficiently
large
for
him
that
runs
to
read
it
is
therefore
only
in
the
wide
thoroughfares
that
very
high
speed
can
be
attained
in
addition
to
the
crank
that
corresponds
to
a
throttle
there
is
a
gauge
on
every
vehicle
which
shows
its
exact
speed
in
miles
per
hour
by
gearing
operated
by
the
revolutions
of
the
wheels
the
policemen
on
duty
also
have
instantaneous
kodaks
mounted
on
tripods
which
show
the
position
of
any
carriage
at
and
intervals
by
which
it
is
easy
to
ascertain
the
exact
speed
should
the
officers
be
unable
to
judge
it
by
the
eye
so
there
is
no
danger
of
a
vehicle
speed
exceeding
that
allowed
in
the
section
in
which
it
happens
to
be
neither
can
a
slow
one
remain
on
the
fast
lines
of
course
to
make
such
high
speed
for
ordinary
carriages
possible
a
perfect
pavement
became
a
sine
qua
non
we
have
secured
this
by
the
sheet
of
steel
spread
over
a
carefully
laid
surface
of
asphalt
with
but
little
bevel
and
though
this
might
be
slippery
for
horses
feet
it
never
seriously
affects
our
wheels
there
being
nothing
harder
than
the
rubber
ties
of
comparatively
light
drays
upon
it
for
the
heavy
traffic
is
carried
by
electric
railways
under
ground
it
will
practically
never
wear
out
with
the
application
of
steel
to
the
entire
surface
became
unnecessary
ordinary
wheels
answering
as
well
as
those
with
flanges
so
that
no
new
tracks
were
laid
and
finally
the
car
companies
tore
up
the
existing
ones
selling
them
in
many
instances
to
the
municipalities
as
old
iron
our
streets
also
need
but
little
cleaning
neither
is
the
surface
continually
indented
as
the
old
and
belgian
blocks
were
by
the
pounding
of
the
horses
feet
so
that
the
substitution
of
electricity
for
animal
power
has
done
much
to
solve
the
problem
of
attractive
streets
scarcely
a
ton
of
coal
comes
to
manhattan
island
or
its
vicinity
in
a
year
very
little
of
it
leaves
the
mines
at
the
mouths
of
which
it
is
converted
into
electricity
and
sent
to
the
points
of
consumption
by
wire
where
it
is
employed
for
all
uses
to
which
fuel
was
put
and
many
others
consequently
there
is
no
smoke
and
the
streets
are
not
encumbered
with
the
entire
width
being
given
up
to
carriages
etc
the
ground
floors
in
the
business
parts
are
used
for
large
warehouses
trucks
running
in
to
load
and
unload
pedestrians
therefore
have
sidewalks
level
with
the
second
story
consisting
of
glass
floors
let
into
aluminum
frames
while
all
street
crossings
are
made
on
bridges
private
houses
have
a
front
door
opening
on
the
sidewalk
and
another
on
the
ground
level
so
that
ladies
paying
visits
or
leaving
cards
can
do
so
in
carriages
in
business
streets
the
second
story
is
used
for
shops
in
place
of
steel
covering
country
roads
have
a
thick
coating
of
cement
and
asphalt
over
a
foundation
of
crushed
stone
giving
a
capital
surface
and
have
a
width
of
feet
two
rods
in
thinly
settled
districts
to
feet
four
rods
where
the
population
is
greater
all
are
planted
with
shade
and
fruit
trees
while
the
wide
driveways
have
one
or
two
broad
sidewalks
the
same
rule
of
making
the
vehicles
keep
near
the
outside
prevails
though
the
rate
of
increase
in
speed
on
approaching
the
middle
is
more
rapid
than
in
cities
and
there
is
usually
no
dividing
ridge
on
reaching
the
top
of
a
long
and
steep
hill
if
we
do
not
wish
to
coast
we
convert
the
motors
into
dynamos
while
running
at
full
speed
and
so
change
the
kinetic
energy
of
the
descent
into
potential
in
our
batteries
this
is
one
of
the
delights
to
which
we
are
heirs
though
horses
are
still
used
by
those
that
prefer
them
we
have
been
much
aided
in
our
material
progress
by
the
facility
with
which
we
obtain
the
metals
it
was
observed
some
time
ago
that
when
artesian
and
oil
wells
had
reached
a
considerable
depth
what
appeared
to
be
drops
of
lead
and
antimony
came
up
with
the
stream
it
finally
occurred
to
a
that
if
he
could
make
his
drill
hard
enough
and
get
it
down
far
enough
keeping
it
cool
by
solidified
carbonic
acid
during
the
proceeding
he
would
reach
a
point
at
which
most
of
the
metals
would
be
viscous
if
not
actually
molten
and
on
being
freed
from
the
pressure
of
the
crust
they
would
expand
and
reach
the
surface
in
a
stream
this
experiment
he
performed
near
the
hot
geysers
in
yellowstone
park
and
what
was
his
delight
on
reaching
a
depth
scarcely
half
a
mile
beyond
his
usual
place
to
be
rewarded
by
a
stream
of
metal
that
heralded
its
approach
by
a
loud
explosion
and
a
great
rush
of
superheated
steam
it
ran
for
a
month
completely
filling
the
bed
of
a
small
river
and
when
it
did
stop
there
were
ten
million
tons
in
sight
this
proved
the
feasibility
of
the
scheme
and
though
many
subsequent
attempts
were
less
successful
we
have
learned
by
experience
where
it
is
best
to
drill
and
can
now
obtain
almost
any
metal
we
wish
eyes
are
of
great
use
to
miners
and
civil
engineers
these
instruments
are
something
like
the
mariner
compass
with
the
sensitiveness
enormously
increased
by
galvanic
currents
the
as
it
were
sees
what
substances
are
underground
and
at
what
distances
it
also
shows
how
many
people
are
in
an
adjoining
room
through
the
magnetic
properties
of
the
iron
in
their
blood
whether
they
are
moving
and
in
what
directions
and
at
what
speed
they
go
in
connection
with
the
phonograph
and
concealed
by
draperies
it
is
useful
to
detectives
who
through
a
registering
attachment
can
obtain
a
record
of
everything
said
and
done
our
political
system
remains
with
but
little
change
each
state
has
still
two
united
states
senators
though
the
population
represented
by
each
representative
has
been
greatly
increased
so
that
the
senate
has
grown
numerically
much
more
than
the
house
it
is
the
duty
of
each
member
of
congress
to
understand
the
conditions
existing
in
every
other
member
state
or
district
and
the
country
interest
always
precedes
that
of
party
we
have
a
comprehensive
examination
system
in
the
civil
service
and
every
officeholder
except
members
of
the
cabinet
retains
his
office
while
efficiently
performing
his
duty
without
regard
to
politics
the
president
can
also
be
any
number
of
times
the
cabinet
members
as
formerly
usually
remain
in
office
while
he
does
and
appear
regularly
in
congress
to
defend
their
measures
the
really
rapid
transit
lines
in
new
york
are
underground
and
have
six
tracks
two
being
used
for
freight
at
all
stations
the
local
tracks
rise
several
feet
towards
the
street
and
slope
off
in
both
directions
while
the
express
tracks
do
this
only
at
stations
at
which
the
faster
trains
stop
this
gives
the
passengers
a
shorter
distance
to
descend
or
rise
in
the
elevators
and
the
ascent
before
the
stations
aids
the
brakes
in
stopping
while
the
drop
helps
the
motors
to
start
the
trains
quickly
in
getting
away
photography
has
also
made
great
strides
and
there
is
now
no
difficulty
in
reproducing
exactly
the
colours
of
the
object
taken
telephones
have
been
so
improved
that
one
person
can
speak
in
his
natural
voice
with
another
in
any
part
of
the
globe
the
wire
that
enables
him
to
hear
also
showing
him
the
face
of
the
speaker
though
he
be
at
the
antipodes
all
telephone
wires
being
underground
and
kept
by
themselves
they
are
not
interfered
with
by
any
or
power
wires
thunderstorms
or
anything
else
is
another
subject
removed
from
the
uncertainties
and
has
become
an
absolute
science
we
produce
clouds
by
explosions
in
the
atmosphere
heights
and
by
surface
air
forced
by
blowers
through
large
pipes
up
the
side
of
a
mountain
or
natural
elevation
and
there
discharged
through
an
opening
in
the
top
of
a
tower
built
on
the
highest
part
the
aeriduct
is
incased
in
a
poor
so
that
the
air
retains
its
warmth
until
discharged
when
it
is
cooled
by
expansion
and
the
surrounding
cold
air
condensation
takes
place
and
soon
serves
to
start
a
rain
yet
until
the
earth
axis
is
straightened
we
must
be
more
or
less
dependent
on
the
eccentricities
of
the
weather
with
extremes
of
heat
and
cold
droughts
and
floods
which
last
are
of
course
largely
the
result
of
several
months
moisture
held
on
the
ground
in
the
form
of
snow
the
congestion
being
relieved
suddenly
by
the
warm
spring
rains
medicine
and
surgery
have
kept
pace
with
other
improvements
inoculation
and
antiseptics
as
already
seen
rendering
most
of
the
germ
diseases
and
formerly
dreaded
epidemics
impotent
while
through
the
potency
of
electrical
affinity
we
form
wholesome
rapidly
instead
of
having
to
wait
for
their
production
by
nature
slow
processes
the
metric
system
now
universal
superseded
the
arbitrary
standards
so
prolific
of
mistakes
and
confusion
about
a
century
ago
english
as
we
have
seen
is
already
the
language
of
people
and
the
number
is
constantly
increasing
through
its
adoption
by
the
numerous
races
of
india
where
even
before
the
close
of
the
last
century
it
was
about
as
important
as
latin
during
the
greatness
of
rome
and
by
the
fact
that
the
spanish
and
portuguese
elements
in
mexico
and
central
and
south
america
show
a
constant
tendency
to
die
out
much
as
the
population
of
spain
fell
from
to
during
the
nineteenth
century
as
this
goes
on
in
the
western
hemisphere
the
places
left
vacant
are
gradually
filled
by
the
more
progressive
so
that
it
looks
as
if
the
study
of
ethnology
in
the
future
would
be
very
simple
the
people
with
cultivation
and
leisure
whose
number
is
increasing
relatively
to
the
population
at
each
generation
spend
much
more
of
their
year
in
the
country
than
formerly
where
they
have
large
and
country
seats
parts
of
which
are
also
preserved
for
game
this
growing
custom
on
the
part
of
society
in
addition
to
being
of
great
advantage
to
the
districts
has
done
much
to
save
the
forests
and
preserve
some
forms
of
game
that
would
otherwise
like
the
buffalo
have
become
extinct
in
astronomy
we
have
also
made
tremendous
strides
the
lens
used
in
telescopes
became
so
heavy
as
its
size
grew
that
it
bent
perceptibly
from
its
own
weight
when
pointed
at
the
zenith
distorting
the
vision
while
when
it
was
used
upon
a
star
near
the
horizon
though
the
glass
on
edge
kept
its
shape
there
was
too
much
atmosphere
between
it
and
the
observed
object
for
successful
study
our
recent
telescopes
have
therefore
concave
mirrors
twenty
metres
in
diameter
like
those
used
for
converging
the
sun
rays
in
solar
engines
but
with
curves
more
mathematically
exact
which
collect
an
immense
amount
of
light
and
focus
it
on
a
sensitive
plate
or
on
the
eye
of
the
observer
whose
back
is
turned
to
the
object
he
is
studying
an
electrical
field
also
plays
an
important
part
the
electricity
being
as
great
an
aid
to
light
as
in
the
telephone
it
is
to
sound
with
these
placed
generally
on
high
mountain
peaks
beyond
the
reach
of
clouds
we
have
enormously
increased
the
number
of
visible
stars
though
there
are
still
probably
boundless
regions
that
we
can
not
see
these
telescopes
have
several
hundred
times
the
power
of
the
largest
lenses
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
apparently
bring
mars
and
jupiter
when
in
opposition
within
one
thousand
and
ten
thousand
miles
respectively
so
that
we
study
their
physical
geography
and
topography
and
we
have
good
maps
of
jupiter
and
even
of
saturn
notwithstanding
their
distance
and
atmospheric
envelopes
and
we
are
able
to
see
the
disks
of
stars
it
seems
as
if
when
we
wish
any
particular
discovery
or
invention
in
whatever
field
we
had
but
to
turn
our
efforts
in
its
direction
to
obtain
our
desire
we
seem
in
fact
to
have
awakened
in
the
scenes
of
the
arabian
nights
yet
the
mysterious
genius
which
we
control
and
which
dims
aladdin
lamp
is
the
gift
of
no
fairy
godmother
sustained
by
the
haze
of
dreams
but
shines
as
the
child
of
science
with
fadeless
and
growing
splendour
and
may
yet
bring
us
and
our
little
planet
much
closer
to
god
we
should
indeed
be
happy
living
as
we
do
at
this
apex
of
attained
civilization
with
the
boundless
possibilities
of
the
future
unfolding
before
us
on
the
horizon
of
which
we
may
fairly
be
said
to
stand
we
are
freed
from
the
rattling
granite
pavement
of
only
a
century
ago
which
made
the
occupant
of
an
omnibus
feel
like
a
fly
inside
of
a
drum
from
the
domination
of
our
local
politics
by
ignorant
foreigners
and
from
country
roads
that
either
filled
the
eyes
lungs
and
hair
of
the
unfortunates
travelling
upon
them
with
dust
or
resembling
ploughed
and
fertilized
fields
saturated
and
plastered
them
with
mud
these
miseries
together
with
in
ocean
travelling
are
forever
passed
and
we
feel
that
is
indeed
our
motto
our
new
and
increasing
sources
of
power
have
so
stimulated
production
and
manufacturing
that
poverty
or
want
is
scarcely
known
while
the
development
of
the
popular
demand
as
a
result
of
the
supplied
need
is
so
great
that
there
is
no
visible
limit
to
the
diversification
of
industry
or
the
possibilities
of
the
arts
it
may
seem
strange
to
some
that
apparently
so
disproportionate
a
number
of
inventions
have
been
made
in
the
last
century
there
are
several
reasons
since
every
discovery
or
advance
in
knowledge
increases
our
chance
of
obtaining
more
it
becomes
cumulative
and
our
progress
is
in
geometric
instead
of
arithmetical
ratio
public
interest
and
general
appreciation
of
the
value
of
time
have
also
effectively
assisted
progress
at
the
beginning
of
each
year
the
president
the
governors
of
the
states
and
the
mayors
of
cities
publish
a
prospectus
of
the
great
improvements
needed
contemplated
and
under
way
within
their
jurisdiction
it
may
be
planning
a
new
boulevard
a
new
park
or
an
improved
system
of
sewers
and
at
the
year
end
they
issue
a
resume
of
everything
completed
and
the
progress
in
everything
else
and
though
there
is
usually
a
great
difference
between
the
results
hoped
for
and
those
attained
the
effect
is
good
the
newspapers
publish
at
length
the
recommendations
of
the
executives
and
also
the
results
obtained
and
keep
up
public
interest
in
all
important
matters
free
to
delve
in
the
allurement
and
fascination
of
science
emancipated
man
goes
on
subduing
nature
as
his
maker
said
he
should
and
turning
her
giant
forces
to
his
service
in
his
constant
struggle
to
rise
and
become
more
like
him
who
gave
the
commandments
and
showed
him
how
he
should
go
notwithstanding
our
strides
in
material
progress
we
are
not
entirely
content
as
the
requirements
of
the
animal
become
fully
supplied
we
feel
a
need
for
something
else
some
say
this
is
like
a
child
that
cries
for
the
moon
but
others
believe
it
the
awakening
and
craving
of
our
souls
the
historian
narrates
but
the
signs
of
the
times
and
strives
to
efface
himself
yet
there
is
clearly
a
void
becoming
yearly
more
apparent
which
materialism
can
not
fill
is
it
some
new
subtle
force
for
which
we
sigh
or
would
we
commune
with
spirits
there
is
so
far
as
we
can
see
no
limit
to
our
journey
and
i
will
add
in
closing
that
with
the
exception
of
religion
we
have
most
to
hope
from
science
chapter
vi
plans
knowing
that
the
rectification
of
the
earth
axis
was
satisfactorily
begun
and
that
each
year
would
show
an
increasing
improvement
in
climate
many
of
the
delegates
after
hearing
bearwarden
speech
set
out
for
their
homes
those
from
the
valley
of
the
amazon
and
the
eastern
coast
of
south
america
boarded
a
lightning
express
that
rushed
them
to
key
west
at
the
rate
of
three
hundred
miles
an
hour
the
railroad
had
six
tracks
two
for
through
passengers
two
for
locals
and
two
for
freight
there
they
took
a
six
hundred
feet
long
by
three
hundred
in
width
the
deck
of
which
was
one
hundred
feet
above
the
surface
which
carried
them
over
the
water
at
the
rate
of
a
mile
a
minute
around
the
eastern
end
of
cuba
through
windward
passage
and
so
to
the
south
american
mainland
where
they
continued
their
journey
by
rail
the
siberian
and
russian
delegates
who
of
course
felt
a
keen
interest
in
the
company
proceedings
took
a
magnetic
car
to
bering
strait
it
was
eighteen
feet
high
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
long
and
had
two
stories
the
upper
with
a
toughened
glass
dome
running
the
entire
length
descended
to
within
three
feet
of
the
floor
and
afforded
an
unobstructed
view
of
the
rushing
scenery
the
rails
on
which
it
ran
were
ten
feet
apart
the
wheels
being
beyond
the
sides
like
those
of
a
carriage
and
fitted
with
ball
bearings
to
ridged
axles
the
car
flexibility
allowed
it
to
follow
slight
irregularities
in
the
track
while
the
free
independent
wheels
gave
it
a
great
advantage
in
rounding
curves
over
cars
with
wheels
and
axle
in
one
casting
in
which
one
must
slip
while
traversing
a
greater
or
smaller
arc
than
the
other
except
when
the
slope
of
the
tread
and
the
centrifugal
force
happen
to
correspond
exactly
the
fact
of
having
its
supports
outside
instead
of
underneath
while
increasing
its
stability
also
enabled
the
lower
floor
to
come
much
nearer
the
ground
while
still
the
wheels
were
large
arriving
in
just
twenty
hours
they
ran
across
on
an
electric
capable
of
carrying
several
dozen
cars
to
east
cape
siberia
and
then
by
running
as
far
north
as
possible
had
a
short
cut
to
europe
the
patagonians
went
by
the
intercontinental
line
without
change
of
cars
making
the
run
of
ten
thousand
miles
in
forty
hours
the
australians
entered
a
flying
machine
and
were
soon
out
of
sight
while
the
central
americans
and
members
from
other
states
of
the
union
returned
for
the
most
part
in
their
mechanical
phaetons
a
prospective
improvement
in
travelling
said
bearwarden
as
he
and
his
friends
watched
the
crowd
disperse
will
be
when
we
can
rise
beyond
the
limits
of
the
atmosphere
wait
till
the
earth
revolves
beneath
us
and
descend
in
twelve
hours
on
the
other
side
true
said
cortlandt
but
then
we
can
travel
westward
only
and
shall
have
to
make
a
complete
circuit
when
we
wish
to
go
east
a
few
days
later
there
was
a
knock
at
president
door
while
he
was
seated
at
his
desk
looking
over
some
papers
and
other
matters
taking
his
foot
from
a
partly
opened
desk
drawer
where
it
had
been
resting
he
placed
it
upon
the
handle
of
a
handsome
bellows
which
proved
to
be
articulating
for
as
he
pressed
it
called
lustily
come
in
the
door
opened
and
in
walked
secretary
of
state
stillman
secretary
of
the
navy
deepwaters
who
was
himself
an
old
sailor
cortlandt
ayrault
dumby
of
the
and
two
of
the
company
directors
said
bearwarden
as
he
shook
hands
with
his
visitors
charmed
to
see
you
that
a
great
invention
said
secretary
stillman
examining
the
bellows
we
must
get
congress
to
make
an
appropriation
for
its
introduction
in
the
department
buildings
in
washington
you
have
no
idea
how
it
dries
my
throat
to
be
all
the
time
shouting
in
do
you
know
bearwarden
said
secretary
deepwaters
i
afraid
when
we
have
this
millennium
of
climate
every
one
will
be
so
well
satisfied
that
our
friend
here
pointing
to
secretary
stillman
with
his
thumb
will
have
nothing
to
do
i
have
sometimes
thought
some
of
the
excitement
will
be
gone
and
the
struggle
of
the
of
the
fittest
will
become
less
problematical
said
bearwarden
the
earth
seems
destined
to
have
a
calm
old
age
said
cortlandt
unless
we
can
look
to
the
cabinet
to
prevent
it
this
world
will
soon
be
a
dull
place
i
wish
we
could
leave
it
for
a
change
said
ayrault
i
do
mean
forever
of
course
but
just
as
people
have
grown
tired
of
remaining
like
plants
in
the
places
in
which
they
grew
alan
has
been
a
caterpillar
for
untold
ages
can
he
not
become
the
butterfly
since
we
have
found
out
how
to
straighten
the
axis
said
deepwaters
might
we
not
go
one
better
and
improve
the
orbit
as
well
increase
the
difference
between
aphelion
and
perihelion
and
give
those
that
still
like
a
changing
climate
a
chance
while
incidentally
we
should
see
more
of
the
world
i
mean
the
solar
system
and
by
enlarging
the
parallax
be
able
to
measure
the
distance
of
a
greater
number
of
fixed
stars
put
your
helm
hard
down
and
shout
you
see
there
is
nothing
simpler
you
keep
her
off
now
and
six
months
hence
you
let
her
luff
that
an
idea
said
bearwarden
our
orbit
could
be
enough
like
that
of
a
comet
to
cross
the
orbits
of
both
venus
and
mars
and
the
climatic
extremes
would
not
be
inconvenient
the
whole
earth
being
simultaneously
warmed
or
cooled
there
would
be
no
equinoctials
or
storms
resulting
from
changes
on
one
part
of
the
surface
from
intense
heat
to
intense
cold
every
part
would
have
a
day
and
night
and
none
would
be
turned
towards
or
from
the
sun
for
six
months
at
a
time
for
however
eccentric
the
orbit
we
should
keep
the
axis
absolutely
straight
at
perihelion
there
would
simply
be
increased
evaporation
and
clouds
near
the
equator
which
would
shield
those
regions
from
the
sun
only
to
disappear
again
as
the
earth
receded
the
only
trouble
said
cortlandt
is
that
we
should
have
no
fulcrum
straightening
the
axis
is
simple
enough
for
we
have
the
attraction
of
the
sun
with
which
to
work
and
we
have
but
to
increase
it
at
one
end
while
decreasing
it
at
the
other
and
change
this
as
the
poles
change
their
inclination
towards
the
sun
to
bring
it
about
if
a
comet
with
a
sufficiently
large
head
would
but
come
along
and
retard
us
or
opportunely
give
us
a
pull
or
if
we
could
increase
the
attraction
of
the
other
planets
for
us
or
decrease
it
at
times
it
might
be
done
if
the
force
the
control
of
which
was
discovered
too
late
to
help
us
straighten
the
axis
could
be
applied
on
a
sufficiently
large
scale
if
apergy
i
have
it
exclaimed
ayrault
jumping
up
apergy
will
do
it
we
can
build
an
airtight
projectile
hermetically
seal
ourselves
within
and
charge
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
will
be
repelled
by
the
magnetism
of
the
earth
and
it
will
be
forced
from
it
with
equal
or
greater
violence
than
that
with
which
it
is
ordinarily
attracted
i
believe
the
earth
has
but
the
same
relation
to
space
that
the
individual
molecule
has
to
any
solid
liquid
or
gaseous
matter
we
know
and
that
just
as
molecules
strive
to
fly
apart
on
the
application
of
heat
this
earth
will
repel
that
projectile
when
electricity
which
we
are
coming
to
look
upon
as
another
form
of
heat
is
properly
applied
it
must
be
so
and
it
is
the
manifest
destiny
of
the
race
to
improve
it
man
is
a
spirit
cursed
with
a
mortal
body
which
glues
him
to
the
earth
and
his
yearning
to
rise
which
is
innate
is
i
believe
only
a
part
of
his
probation
and
trial
show
us
how
it
can
be
done
shouted
his
listeners
in
chorus
apergy
is
and
must
be
able
to
do
it
ayrault
continued
throughout
nature
we
find
a
system
of
compensation
the
centripetal
force
is
offset
by
the
centrifugal
and
when
according
to
the
fable
the
crystal
complained
of
its
hard
lot
in
being
unable
to
move
while
the
eagle
could
soar
through
the
upper
air
and
see
all
the
glories
of
the
world
the
bird
replied
life
is
but
for
a
moment
while
you
set
in
the
rock
will
live
forever
and
will
see
the
last
sunrise
that
flashes
upon
the
earth
we
know
that
christ
while
walking
on
the
waves
did
not
sink
and
that
he
and
elijah
were
carried
up
into
heaven
what
became
of
their
material
bodies
we
can
not
tell
but
they
were
certainly
superior
to
the
force
of
gravitation
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
in
miracles
any
natural
law
was
broken
or
even
set
aside
but
simply
that
some
other
law
whose
workings
we
do
not
understand
became
operative
and
modified
the
law
that
otherwise
would
have
had
things
its
own
way
in
apergy
we
undoubtedly
have
the
counterpart
of
gravitation
which
must
exist
or
system
of
compensation
is
broken
may
we
not
believe
that
in
christ
transfiguration
on
the
mount
and
in
the
appearance
of
moses
and
elias
with
him
doubtless
in
the
flesh
since
otherwise
mortal
eyes
could
not
have
seen
them
apergy
came
into
play
and
upheld
them
that
otherwise
and
if
no
other
modification
had
intervened
they
would
have
fallen
to
the
ground
and
that
apergy
was
in
other
words
the
working
principle
of
those
miracles
may
we
not
also
believe
added
cortlandt
that
in
the
transfiguration
christ
companions
took
the
substance
of
their
material
bodies
the
oxygen
hydrogen
nitrogen
and
carbon
from
the
air
and
the
moisture
it
contained
for
though
spiritual
bodies
be
their
activity
magnetic
or
any
other
could
of
course
pass
the
absolute
cold
and
void
of
space
without
being
affected
no
mortal
body
could
and
that
in
the
same
manner
elijah
body
dissolved
into
air
without
the
usual
intervention
of
decomposition
for
we
know
that
though
matter
can
easily
change
its
form
it
can
never
be
destroyed
all
assented
to
this
and
ayrault
continued
if
apergy
can
annul
gravitation
i
do
not
see
why
it
should
not
do
more
for
to
annul
it
the
repulsion
of
the
earth
that
it
produces
must
be
as
great
as
its
attraction
unless
we
suppose
gravitation
for
the
time
being
to
be
suspended
but
whether
it
is
or
not
does
not
affect
the
result
in
this
case
for
after
the
apergetic
repulsion
is
brought
to
the
degree
at
which
a
body
does
not
fall
any
increase
in
the
current
strength
will
cause
it
to
rise
and
in
the
case
of
we
know
that
the
attraction
or
repulsion
has
practically
no
limit
this
will
be
of
great
advantage
to
us
he
continued
for
if
a
projectile
could
move
away
from
the
earth
with
no
more
rapid
acceleration
than
that
with
which
it
approaches
it
would
take
too
long
to
reach
the
nearest
planet
but
the
maximum
repulsion
being
at
the
start
by
reason
of
its
proximity
to
the
earth
for
apergy
being
the
counterpart
of
gravitation
is
subject
to
newton
and
laws
the
acceleration
of
a
body
apergetically
charged
will
be
greatest
at
first
two
inclined
planes
may
have
the
same
fall
but
a
ball
will
reach
the
bottom
of
one
that
is
steepest
near
the
top
in
less
time
than
on
any
other
because
the
maximum
acceleration
is
at
the
start
we
are
all
tired
of
being
stuck
to
this
cosmical
speck
with
its
monotonous
ocean
leaden
sky
and
single
moon
that
is
useless
more
than
half
the
time
while
its
size
is
so
microscopic
compared
with
the
universe
that
we
can
traverse
its
great
circle
in
four
days
its
possibilities
are
exhausted
and
just
as
greece
became
too
small
for
the
civilization
of
the
greeks
and
as
reproduction
is
growth
beyond
the
individual
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
future
glory
of
the
human
race
lies
in
exploring
at
least
the
solar
system
without
waiting
to
become
shades
should
you
propose
to
go
to
mars
or
venus
asked
cortlandt
no
replied
ayrault
we
know
all
about
mars
it
is
but
one
seventh
the
size
of
the
earth
and
as
the
axis
is
inclined
more
than
ours
it
would
be
a
less
comfortable
globe
than
this
while
as
our
president
here
told
us
in
his
company
report
the
axis
of
venus
is
inclined
to
such
a
degree
that
it
would
be
almost
uninhabitable
for
us
it
would
be
as
if
colonists
tried
to
settle
greenland
or
had
come
to
north
america
during
its
glacial
period
neither
venus
nor
mars
would
be
a
good
place
now
where
should
you
propose
to
go
asked
stillman
to
jupiter
and
if
possible
after
that
to
saturn
replied
ayrault
the
former
mean
distance
from
the
sun
is
miles
but
as
our
president
showed
us
its
axis
is
so
nearly
straight
that
i
think
with
its
internal
warmth
there
will
be
nothing
to
fear
from
cold
though
on
account
of
the
vast
size
objects
on
its
surface
weigh
more
than
twice
as
much
as
here
if
i
am
able
to
reach
it
by
means
of
apergy
the
same
force
will
enable
me
to
regulate
my
weight
will
any
one
go
with
me
splendid
said
bearwarden
if
dumby
our
will
temporarily
assume
my
office
nothing
will
give
me
greater
pleasure
so
will
i
go
if
there
is
room
for
me
said
cortlandt
i
will
at
once
resign
my
place
as
government
expert
and
consider
it
the
grandest
event
of
my
life
if
i
were
not
afraid
of
leaving
stillman
here
to
his
own
devices
i
ask
for
a
berth
as
well
said
deepwaters
i
am
afraid
said
stillman
if
you
take
any
more
you
will
be
overcrowded
modesty
forbids
his
saying
said
deepwaters
that
it
do
for
the
country
to
have
all
its
eggs
in
one
basket
are
you
not
afraid
you
will
find
the
surface
hot
or
even
molten
asked
dumby
with
its
thousand
five
hundred
mile
diameter
the
amount
of
original
internal
heat
must
have
been
terrific
no
said
cortlandt
it
can
not
be
molten
or
even
in
the
least
degree
luminous
for
if
it
were
its
satellites
would
be
visible
when
they
enter
its
shadow
whereas
they
entirely
disappear
i
do
not
believe
jupiter
surface
is
even
perceptibly
warm
said
bearwarden
we
know
that
algol
known
to
the
ancients
as
the
star
and
several
other
variable
stars
are
accompanied
by
a
dark
companion
with
which
they
revolve
about
a
common
centre
and
which
periodically
obscures
part
of
their
light
now
some
of
these
are
nearly
as
large
as
our
sun
and
of
course
many
hundred
times
the
size
of
jupiter
if
these
bodies
have
lost
enough
heat
to
be
invisible
surface
at
least
must
be
nearly
cold
in
the
phosphorescence
of
seawater
said
cortlandt
and
in
other
instances
in
nature
we
find
light
without
heat
and
we
may
soon
be
able
to
produce
it
in
the
arts
by
oxidizing
coal
without
the
intervention
of
the
steam
engine
but
we
never
find
any
considerable
heat
without
light
i
am
convinced
said
bearwarden
that
we
shall
find
jupiter
habitable
for
intelligent
beings
who
have
been
developed
on
a
more
advanced
sphere
than
itself
though
i
do
not
believe
it
has
progressed
far
enough
in
its
evolution
to
produce
them
i
expect
to
find
it
in
its
palaeozoic
or
mesozoic
period
while
over
a
hundred
years
ago
the
english
astronomer
chambers
thought
that
on
saturn
there
was
good
reason
for
suspecting
the
presence
of
snow
what
sort
of
spaceship
do
you
propose
to
have
asked
the
as
you
have
to
pass
through
but
little
air
said
deepwaters
i
should
suggest
a
cylinder
of
large
diameter
with
a
flat
base
and
dome
roof
composed
of
aluminum
or
still
better
of
glucinum
or
beryllium
as
it
is
sometimes
called
which
is
twice
as
good
a
conductor
of
electricity
as
aluminum
four
times
as
strong
and
is
the
lightest
of
all
known
metals
having
a
specific
gravity
of
only
two
which
last
property
will
be
of
great
use
to
you
for
of
course
the
more
weight
you
have
to
propel
the
more
apergetic
repulsion
you
will
have
to
develop
i
will
get
some
i
left
outside
in
my
trap
said
ayrault
when
with
your
ideas
we
may
arrive
at
something
definite
saying
which
he
left
the
room
he
seems
very
cynical
in
his
ideas
of
life
and
the
world
in
general
said
secretary
stillman
for
a
man
of
his
age
and
one
that
is
engaged
you
see
replied
bearwarden
his
fiancee
is
not
yet
a
senior
being
in
the
class
of
two
thousand
and
one
at
vassar
and
so
can
not
marry
him
for
a
year
not
till
next
june
can
this
sweet
girl
graduate
come
forth
with
her
and
sheepskin
to
enlighten
the
world
and
make
him
happy
that
is
i
suspect
one
reason
why
he
proposed
this
trip
chapter
vii
hard
at
work
in
a
few
moments
ayrault
returned
with
pencils
a
pair
of
compasses
and
paper
let
us
see
in
the
first
place
said
deepwaters
how
long
the
journey
will
take
since
a
stone
falls
feet
the
first
second
and
feet
the
next
it
is
easy
to
calculate
at
what
rate
your
speed
would
increase
with
the
repulsion
twice
that
of
the
ordinary
traction
but
i
think
this
would
be
too
slow
it
will
be
best
to
treble
or
quadruple
the
apergetic
charge
which
can
easily
be
done
in
which
case
your
speed
will
exceed
the
of
a
projectile
from
a
gun
in
a
few
seconds
as
the
earth
repulsion
decreases
the
attraction
of
mars
and
jupiter
will
increase
and
there
being
no
resistance
your
gait
will
become
more
and
more
rapid
till
it
is
necessary
to
reverse
the
charge
to
avoid
being
dashed
to
pieces
or
being
consumed
like
a
falling
star
by
the
friction
in
passing
through
jupiter
atmosphere
you
can
be
on
the
safe
side
by
checking
your
speed
in
advance
you
must
of
course
be
careful
to
avoid
collisions
with
meteors
and
asteroids
but
if
you
do
they
will
be
of
use
to
you
for
by
attracting
or
repelling
them
you
can
change
your
course
to
suit
yourself
and
also
theirs
in
inverse
ratio
to
their
masses
jupiter
moons
will
be
like
head
and
stern
lines
in
enabling
you
to
choose
the
part
of
the
surface
on
which
you
wish
to
land
with
apergy
it
is
as
essential
to
have
some
heavy
body
on
which
to
work
within
range
as
to
have
water
about
a
ship
propellers
whether
when
apergy
is
developed
gravitation
is
temporarily
annulled
or
reversed
like
the
late
attraction
of
a
magnet
when
the
current
is
changed
or
whether
it
is
merely
overpowered
in
which
case
your
motion
will
be
the
resultant
of
the
two
is
an
unsettled
and
not
very
important
point
for
though
we
know
but
little
more
of
the
nature
of
electricity
than
was
known
a
hundred
years
ago
this
does
not
prevent
our
producing
and
using
it
jupiter
when
in
opposition
he
continued
is
about
miles
from
us
and
it
takes
light
which
travels
at
the
rate
of
miles
a
second
just
minutes
to
reach
the
earth
from
jupiter
if
we
suppose
the
average
speed
of
your
ship
to
be
as
great
it
will
take
you
just
eleven
days
nineteen
hours
and
twenty
minutes
to
make
the
journey
you
will
have
a
fine
view
of
mars
and
the
asteroids
and
when
miles
from
jupiter
will
cross
the
orbit
of
callisto
the
fifth
moon
in
distance
from
the
giant
planet
that
will
be
your
best
point
to
steer
by
i
think
said
ayrault
as
that
will
be
the
first
member
of
jupiter
system
we
pass
and
as
it
will
guide
us
into
port
it
would
be
a
good
name
for
our
ship
and
you
must
christen
her
if
we
have
her
launched
no
no
said
deepwaters
miss
preston
must
do
that
but
we
certainly
should
have
a
launch
for
you
might
have
to
land
in
the
water
and
you
must
be
sure
the
ship
is
tight
talking
of
tight
ships
said
bearwarden
passing
a
decanter
of
claret
to
stillman
may
remind
us
that
it
is
time
to
splice
the
brace
there
a
bottle
of
whisky
and
some
water
just
behind
you
he
added
to
deepwaters
while
three
minutes
after
i
ring
this
bell
he
said
pressing
a
button
and
jerking
a
handle
marked
the
champagne
cocktails
will
be
on
the
desk
i
see
you
know
his
ways
said
stillman
to
bearwarden
drooping
his
eyes
in
deepwaters
direction
oh
yes
i
been
here
before
replied
deepwaters
you
see
we
navy
men
have
to
hustle
and
ca
pass
our
time
in
a
chair
talking
platitudes
at
this
moment
there
was
a
slight
rumbling
and
eight
champagne
cocktails
with
the
froth
still
on
and
straws
on
a
separate
plate
shot
in
and
landed
on
a
corner
of
the
desk
help
yourselves
gentlemen
said
bearwarden
placing
them
on
a
table
i
hope
we
shall
find
them
cold
do
you
know
said
deepwaters
to
ayrault
while
rapidly
making
his
cocktail
disappear
the
callisto
cost
with
its
outfit
will
be
very
great
especially
if
you
use
glucinum
which
though
the
ideal
metal
for
the
purpose
comes
pretty
high
i
suggest
that
you
apply
to
congress
for
an
appropriation
this
experiment
comes
under
the
of
science
act
and
any
bill
for
it
would
certainly
pass
no
indeed
replied
ayrault
the
callisto
trip
will
be
a
privilege
and
glory
i
would
not
miss
and
building
her
will
be
a
part
of
it
i
shall
put
in
everything
conducive
to
success
but
will
come
to
the
government
only
for
advice
i
will
send
a
letter
to
all
our
ambassadors
and
consuls
said
stillman
to
telegraph
the
department
anything
they
may
know
or
learn
that
will
be
of
use
in
adjusting
the
batteries
controlling
the
machine
or
anything
else
and
will
turn
over
to
you
in
a
succinct
form
all
information
that
may
be
relevant
for
without
such
sorting
you
would
be
overwhelmed
and
i
said
deepwaters
will
order
the
commanders
of
our
vessels
to
give
you
a
farewell
salute
at
starting
and
to
pick
you
up
in
case
you
fail
when
you
have
demonstrated
the
suitability
of
apergy
he
continued
and
the
habitability
of
jupiter
and
saturn
which
with
their
five
and
eight
moons
respectively
and
rings
thrown
in
must
both
be
vastly
superior
to
our
little
globe
we
will
see
what
can
be
done
towards
changing
our
orbit
and
if
we
can
not
swing
a
little
nearer
to
our
new
world
or
worlds
then
we
lower
or
rather
raise
the
boats
in
the
shape
of
numerous
callistos
and
have
a
ready
at
each
opposition
while
a
man
or
two
can
be
placed
in
charge
of
each
projectile
to
bring
it
back
in
ballast
thus
we
may
soon
have
regular
interplanetary
lines
as
every
place
seems
to
have
been
settled
from
some
other
said
cortlandt
i
do
not
see
why
with
increased
scientific
facilities
history
should
not
repeat
itself
and
this
be
the
point
from
which
to
colonize
the
solar
system
for
for
the
present
at
least
it
would
seem
that
we
could
not
get
beyond
that
as
it
will
be
quite
an
undertaking
to
change
the
orbit
said
deepwaters
we
shall
have
time
meanwhile
to
absorb
or
run
out
all
inferior
races
so
that
we
shall
not
make
the
mistake
of
extending
the
tower
of
babel
he
is
putting
on
his
said
stillman
and
will
soon
want
a
planet
to
himself
i
see
no
necessity
for
even
changing
the
orbit
said
bearwarden
except
for
the
benefit
of
those
that
remain
if
this
attempt
succeeds
it
can
doubtless
be
repeated
an
increase
in
eccentricity
would
merely
shorten
the
journey
if
aphelion
always
coincided
with
opposition
which
it
would
not
let
us
know
how
you
are
getting
on
said
deepwaters
to
ayrault
and
be
sure
you
have
the
callisto
properly
christened
step
lively
there
landlubbers
he
called
to
stillman
i
have
an
appointment
at
washington
at
one
and
it
is
now
twenty
minutes
past
twelve
we
can
lunch
on
the
way
ayrault
immediately
advertised
for
bids
for
the
construction
of
a
glucinum
cylinder
feet
in
diameter
fifteen
feet
high
at
the
sides
with
a
domed
roof
bringing
up
the
total
height
to
feet
and
with
a
small
gutter
about
it
to
catch
the
rain
on
jupiter
or
any
other
planet
they
might
visit
the
sides
roof
and
floor
were
to
consist
of
two
sheets
each
one
third
of
an
inch
thick
and
six
inches
apart
the
space
between
to
be
filled
with
mineral
wool
as
a
protection
against
the
intense
cold
of
space
there
were
also
to
be
several
keels
and
supports
underneath
on
which
the
car
should
rest
large
toughened
windows
were
to
be
let
into
the
roof
and
sides
and
smaller
ones
in
the
floor
all
to
be
furnished
with
thick
shades
and
curtains
ayrault
also
decided
to
have
it
divided
into
two
stories
with
ceilings
six
and
a
half
to
seven
and
a
half
feet
high
respectively
with
a
sort
of
crow
nest
or
observatory
at
the
top
the
floors
to
be
work
like
those
in
the
of
a
steamer
so
that
when
the
carpets
were
rolled
up
they
should
not
greatly
obstruct
the
view
the
wide
flat
base
and
the
low
centre
of
gravity
would
he
saw
be
of
use
in
withstanding
the
high
winds
that
he
knew
often
prevailed
on
jupiter
as
soon
as
possible
he
awarded
the
contract
and
then
entering
his
smart
electric
trap
steered
for
vassar
university
along
what
was
the
old
though
its
builders
would
not
have
recognized
it
with
its
asphalt
surface
straightened
curves
and
easy
grades
to
ask
his
idol
to
christen
the
callisto
when
it
should
be
finished
starting
from
the
upper
end
of
central
park
he
stopped
to
buy
her
a
bunch
of
violets
and
then
ran
to
poughkeepsie
in
two
hours
sylvia
preston
was
a
lovely
girl
with
blue
eyes
brown
hair
and
perfect
figure
clear
white
skin
and
just
twenty
she
was
delighted
to
see
him
and
said
she
would
love
to
christen
the
callisto
or
do
anything
else
that
he
wished
but
i
am
so
sorry
you
are
going
away
she
went
on
i
hate
to
lose
you
for
so
long
and
we
shall
not
even
be
able
to
write
why
could
we
be
married
now
he
asked
and
go
to
jupiter
for
our
honeymoon
i
afraid
dear
she
answered
you
would
be
sorry
a
few
years
hence
if
i
did
take
my
degree
and
besides
as
you
have
asked
those
other
men
there
would
be
room
for
me
we
could
have
made
other
arrangements
he
replied
had
i
been
able
to
persuade
you
to
go
wo
you
dine
with
us
at
delmonico
this
evening
and
go
to
the
play
she
asked
papa
has
taken
a
box
of
course
i
will
he
said
brightening
up
what
are
you
going
to
wear
oh
i
suppose
something
light
and
cool
for
it
so
hot
she
answered
i
go
now
so
as
to
be
ready
he
said
getting
up
and
going
towards
the
door
to
which
sylvia
followed
him
a
man
in
livery
stood
at
the
step
of
the
phaeton
ayrault
got
in
and
turned
on
the
current
and
his
man
climbed
up
behind
on
turning
into
the
main
road
ayrault
was
about
to
increase
his
speed
when
sylvia
who
had
taken
a
short
cut
appeared
at
the
wayside
carrying
her
hat
in
one
hand
and
her
gloves
in
the
other
i
could
let
you
go
all
by
yourself
she
said
the
fact
is
i
wanted
to
be
with
you
you
are
the
sweetest
thing
that
ever
lived
and
i
love
you
all
my
days
he
said
getting
down
and
helping
sylvia
to
the
seat
beside
him
what
a
nuisance
this
fellow
behind
is
he
continued
referring
to
the
groom
for
though
he
is
a
russian
and
speaks
but
little
english
it
is
unpleasant
to
feel
he
is
there
you
have
to
write
your
sweet
nothings
instead
of
saying
them
sylvia
replied
for
you
to
leave
around
for
other
girls
to
see
answered
ayrault
with
a
smile
i
do
know
what
your
other
girls
do
she
returned
but
with
me
you
are
safe
ayrault
fairly
made
his
phaeton
spin
going
up
the
grades
like
a
shot
and
down
like
a
bird
on
reaching
new
york
he
left
sylvia
at
her
house
then
ran
his
machine
to
a
florist
where
he
ordered
some
lilies
and
roses
and
then
steered
his
way
to
his
club
where
he
dressed
for
dinner
shortly
before
the
time
he
repaired
to
delmonico
which
name
had
become
historical
though
the
founders
themselves
were
long
dead
and
sat
guard
at
a
table
till
sylvia
wearing
his
flowers
and
looking
more
beautiful
than
any
of
them
arrived
with
her
mother
and
father
and
bearwarden
whom
they
knew
very
well
how
are
the
exams
getting
on
miss
preston
bearwarden
asked
pretty
well
she
replied
with
a
smile
we
had
english
literature
yesterday
and
natural
history
the
day
before
next
week
we
have
chemistry
and
philosophy
what
are
you
taking
in
natural
history
asked
bearwarden
with
interest
oh
principally
physical
geography
geology
and
meteorology
she
replied
i
think
them
entrancing
it
must
be
a
consolation
said
ayrault
when
your
best
hat
is
spoiled
by
rain
to
know
the
reason
why
your
average
he
continued
addressing
sylvia
was
ninety
in
the
and
i
have
a
doubt
that
the
finals
will
maintain
your
record
for
the
year
do
be
too
sure
she
replied
i
have
been
loafing
awfully
and
had
to
engage
a
as
a
coach
after
dinner
they
went
to
the
play
where
they
saw
a
presentation
of
society
at
the
close
of
the
twentieth
century
which
sylvia
and
ayrault
enjoyed
immensely
a
few
days
after
the
delmonico
dinner
while
bearwarden
cortlandt
and
ayrault
sat
together
discussing
their
plans
the
servant
announced
ayrault
family
physician
tubercle
germiny
who
had
been
requested
to
call
delighted
to
see
you
doctor
said
ayrault
shaking
hands
you
know
bearwarden
our
president
and
cortlandt
an
ll
however
and
not
a
medico
i
have
had
the
pleasure
replied
germiny
shaking
hands
with
both
as
you
may
be
aware
doctor
said
ayrault
when
they
were
seated
we
are
about
to
take
a
short
trip
to
jupiter
and
if
time
allows
to
saturn
we
have
come
to
you
as
one
familiar
with
every
known
germ
for
a
few
precautionary
suggestions
and
advice
concerning
our
indeed
replied
germiny
a
thorough
knowledge
of
bacteriology
is
the
groundwork
of
therapeutics
it
is
practically
admitted
that
every
ailment
with
the
exception
of
mechanical
injuries
is
the
direct
result
of
a
specific
germ
and
even
in
accidents
and
simple
fractures
no
matter
what
may
be
the
nature
of
the
bruise
a
soon
announces
its
presence
so
that
if
not
the
parent
it
is
the
inseparable
companion
in
fact
the
shadow
of
disease
now
though
not
the
first
cause
in
this
instance
it
has
been
indubitably
proved
that
much
of
the
effect
the
fever
and
pain
are
produced
and
continued
by
the
active
omnipresent
sleepless
sperm
either
kill
the
micrococcus
or
heal
the
wound
and
you
are
free
from
both
it
being
therefore
granted
that
the
ills
of
life
are
in
the
air
we
have
but
to
find
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
case
in
hand
its
habits
tastes
and
constitution
in
order
to
destroy
it
impoverish
the
soil
on
which
it
thrives
before
its
arrival
if
you
can
foresee
the
nature
of
the
inoculation
to
which
you
will
be
exposed
by
a
dilute
solution
of
itself
and
supply
it
only
with
what
it
particularly
dislikes
for
an
already
established
tubercle
requiring
rapid
action
of
the
blood
such
as
may
well
exist
among
the
birds
and
vertebrates
of
jupiter
and
saturn
i
suggest
a
hypodermic
rattlesnake
injection
while
hydrocyanic
acid
and
tarantula
saliva
may
also
come
in
well
the
combinations
that
so
long
destroyed
us
have
already
become
our
panacea
i
see
you
have
these
poisons
at
your
fingers
ends
said
ayrault
and
we
shall
feel
the
utmost
confidence
in
the
remedies
and
directions
you
prescribe
they
found
that
in
addition
to
their
they
would
have
to
make
room
for
the
following
articles
and
also
many
more
six
three
three
magazine
three
rifles
three
revolvers
a
large
supply
of
ammunition
explosive
and
solid
balls

at
last
the
preparations
were
completed
and
it
was
arranged
that
the
callisto
should
begin
its
journey
at
eleven
december
the
northern
hemisphere
shortest
day
though
six
months
operations
could
hardly
be
expected
to
have
produced
much
change
in
the
inclination
of
the
earth
axis
the
autumn
held
on
wonderfully
and
december
was
pronounced
very
mild
fully
a
million
people
were
in
and
about
van
cortlandt
park
hours
before
the
time
announced
for
the
start
and
those
near
looked
inquiringly
at
the
trim
little
that
having
done
well
on
the
trial
trip
rested
on
her
longitudinal
and
transverse
keels
with
a
battery
of
chemicals
alongside
to
make
sure
of
a
full
power
supply
the
president
and
his
cabinet
including
of
course
the
shining
lights
of
the
state
and
navy
departments
came
from
washington
these
together
with
and
preston
and
a
number
of
people
with
passes
occupied
seats
arranged
at
the
sides
of
the
platform
while
sightseers
and
scientists
assembled
from
every
part
of
the
world
there
a
ship
for
you
said
secretary
stillman
to
the
secretary
of
the
navy
she
not
have
to
be
for
barnacles
neither
will
the
least
breeze
make
the
passengers
sick
that
all
you
landlubbers
think
of
replied
deepwaters
i
remember
one
of
the
kings
over
in
europe
said
to
me
as
he
introduced
me
to
the
queen
secretary
of
state
is
a
great
man
but
why
does
he
always
part
his
hair
in
the
middle
that
it
shall
not
turn
his
head
i
replied
with
so
gallant
and
handsome
an
officer
as
you
to
lean
upon
he
answered
should
think
he
could
look
down
on
all
the
world
whereupon
i
asked
him
what
he
take
to
drink
your
apology
is
accepted
replied
secretary
stillman
cortlandt
also
came
from
washington
where
as
chief
of
the
government
expert
examiners
board
he
had
temporary
quarters
bearwarden
sailed
over
the
spectators
heads
in
one
of
the
terrestrial
axis
straightening
company
flying
machines
while
ayrault
to
avoid
the
crowd
had
come
to
the
callisto
early
and
was
showing
the
interior
arrangements
to
sylvia
who
had
accompanied
him
she
was
somewhat
piqued
because
at
the
last
moment
he
had
not
absolutely
insisted
on
carrying
her
off
or
offered
if
necessary
to
displace
his
presidential
and
friends
in
order
to
make
room
you
will
have
an
ideal
trip
she
said
looking
over
some
astronomical
and
photographic
maps
of
jupiter
and
saturn
that
lay
on
the
table
with
a
pair
of
compasses
and
i
hope
you
wo
lose
your
way
i
shall
need
no
compass
to
find
my
way
back
replied
ayrault
if
i
ever
succeed
in
leaving
this
planet
neither
will
be
necessary
for
you
will
be
a
magnet
stronger
than
any
compass
and
compared
with
my
star
all
others
are
dim
you
should
write
a
book
said
sylvia
and
put
some
of
those
things
in
it
she
was
wearing
a
bunch
of
and
violets
that
she
had
cut
from
a
small
of
potted
plants
ayrault
had
sent
her
which
she
had
placed
in
her
conservatory
at
this
moment
the
small
chime
clock
set
in
the
rang
out
quarter
to
eleven
as
the
sounds
died
away
sylvia
became
very
pale
and
began
to
regret
in
her
womanly
way
that
she
had
allowed
her
hero
to
attempt
this
experiment
oh
she
said
clinging
to
his
arm
it
was
very
wrong
of
me
to
let
you
begin
this
i
was
so
dazzled
by
the
splendour
of
your
scheme
when
i
heard
it
and
so
anxious
that
you
should
have
the
glory
of
being
the
first
to
surpass
columbus
that
i
did
not
realize
the
full
meaning
i
thought
also
you
seemed
rather
ready
to
leave
me
she
added
gently
and
so
said
little
you
do
not
know
how
it
almost
breaks
my
heart
now
that
i
am
about
to
lose
you
it
was
quixotic
to
let
you
undertake
this
journey
an
undertaker
would
have
given
me
his
kind
offices
for
one
even
longer
had
i
remained
here
replied
ayrault
i
can
not
live
in
this
humdrum
world
without
you
the
most
sustained
excitement
can
not
even
palliate
what
seems
to
me
like
unrequited
love
o
dick
she
exclaimed
giving
him
a
reproachful
glance
you
must
say
that
you
know
you
have
often
told
me
my
reason
for
staying
and
taking
my
degree
was
good
my
lot
will
be
very
much
harder
than
yours
for
you
will
forget
me
in
the
excitement
of
discovery
and
adventure
but
i
what
can
i
do
in
the
midst
of
all
the
old
associations
never
mind
sweetheart
he
said
kissing
her
hand
i
have
seemed
on
the
verge
of
despair
all
the
time
seeing
that
their
separation
must
shortly
begin
ayrault
tried
to
assume
a
cheerful
look
but
as
sylvia
turned
her
eyes
away
they
were
suspiciously
moist
just
one
minute
before
the
ayrault
took
sylvia
back
to
her
mother
and
after
pressing
her
hand
and
having
one
last
long
look
into
her
or
as
he
considered
them
his
eyes
he
returned
to
the
callisto
and
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
telescopic
aluminum
ladder
when
his
friends
arrived
as
all
baggage
and
impedimenta
bad
been
sent
aboard
and
properly
stowed
the
day
before
the
travellers
had
not
to
do
but
climb
to
and
enter
by
the
window
it
distressed
bearwarden
that
the
north
pole
exact
declination
on
the
day
of
december
when
the
axis
was
most
inclined
could
not
be
figured
out
by
the
hour
at
which
they
were
to
start
so
as
to
show
what
change
if
any
had
already
been
brought
about
but
the
astronomers
were
working
industriously
and
promised
that
if
it
were
finished
by
midnight
they
would
telegraph
the
result
into
space
by
code
raising
his
hat
to
his
fiancee
and
his
prospective
ayrault
followed
them
up
to
draw
in
and
fold
the
ladder
was
but
the
work
of
a
moment
as
the
clocks
in
the
neighbouring
steeples
began
to
strike
eleven
ayrault
touched
the
switch
that
would
correspond
to
the
throttle
of
an
engine
and
the
motors
began
to
work
at
rapidly
increasing
speed
slowly
the
callisto
left
her
as
a
galatea
might
her
pedestal
only
instead
of
coming
down
she
rose
still
higher
a
large
american
flag
hanging
from
the
window
which
as
they
started
fluttered
as
in
a
southern
zephyr
soon
began
to
flap
as
in
a
stiff
breeze
as
the
car
speed
increased
with
a
final
wave
at
which
a
battery
of
made
the
air
ring
with
a
salute
and
the
multitude
raised
a
mighty
cheer
they
drew
it
in
and
closed
the
window
sealing
it
hermetically
in
order
to
keep
in
the
air
that
had
an
opening
remained
would
soon
have
become
rarefied
sylvia
had
waved
her
handkerchief
with
the
utmost
enthusiasm
in
spite
of
the
sadness
at
her
heart
but
she
now
had
other
use
for
it
in
trying
to
hide
her
tears
the
callisto
was
still
going
straight
up
with
a
speed
already
as
great
as
a
cannon
ball
and
was
almost
out
of
sight
the
multitude
then
began
to
disperse
and
sylvia
returned
to
her
home
let
us
now
follow
the
callisto
the
earth
and
jupiter
not
being
exactly
in
opposition
as
they
would
be
if
the
sun
the
earth
and
jupiter
were
in
line
with
the
earth
between
the
two
but
rather
as
shown
in
the
diagram
the
callisto
journey
was
considerably
more
than
miles
the
mean
opposition
distance
as
they
wished
to
start
by
daylight
from
the
side
of
the
earth
turned
towards
the
sun
they
could
not
steer
immediately
for
jupiter
but
were
obliged
to
go
a
few
hundred
miles
in
the
direction
of
the
sun
then
change
their
course
to
something
like
a
tangent
to
the
earth
and
get
their
final
right
direction
in
swinging
near
the
moon
since
they
must
be
comparatively
near
some
material
object
to
bring
apergy
into
play
the
maximum
power
being
turned
on
the
projectile
shot
from
the
earth
with
tremendous
and
rapidly
increasing
speed
by
the
shortest
course
a
straight
line
so
that
for
the
present
it
was
not
necessary
to
steer
until
beyond
the
limits
of
the
atmosphere
they
kept
the
greatest
apergetic
repulsion
focused
on
the
upper
part
of
their
cylinder
so
that
its
point
went
first
and
they
encountered
least
possible
resistance
looking
through
the
floor
windows
therefore
the
travellers
had
a
most
superb
view
the
air
being
clear
the
eastern
border
of
north
america
and
the
atlantic
were
outlined
as
on
a
map
the
blue
of
the
ocean
and
brownish
colour
of
the
land
with
white
patches
on
the
elevations
being
very
marked
the
hudson
and
the
sound
appeared
as
clearly
defined
blue
ribbons
and
between
and
around
the
two
they
could
see
new
york
they
also
saw
the
ocean
dotted
for
miles
with
points
in
which
they
recognized
the
marine
spiders
and
cruisers
of
the
north
atlantic
squadron
and
the
ships
on
the
home
station
which
they
knew
were
watching
them
through
their
glasses
i
see
said
cortlandt
that
deepwaters
has
been
as
good
as
his
word
and
has
his
ships
on
the
watch
to
rescue
us
in
case
we
fail
yes
replied
bearwarden
he
is
the
right
sort
when
he
gave
that
promise
i
knew
his
men
would
be
there
they
soon
perceived
that
they
had
reached
the
void
of
space
for
though
the
sun
blazed
with
a
splendour
they
had
never
before
seen
the
firmament
was
intensely
black
and
the
stars
shone
as
at
midnight
here
they
began
to
change
their
course
to
a
curve
beginning
with
a
spiral
by
charging
the
callisto
apergetically
and
directing
the
current
towards
the
moon
to
act
as
an
aid
to
the
lunar
attraction
while
still
allowing
the
earth
to
repel
and
their
motion
gradually
became
the
resultant
of
the
two
forces
the
change
from
a
straight
line
being
so
gradual
however
that
for
some
minutes
they
scarcely
perceived
it
the
coronal
streamers
about
the
sun
such
as
are
visible
on
earth
during
a
total
eclipse
shone
with
a
halo
against
the
background
bursting
forth
to
a
height
of
twenty
or
thirty
thousand
miles
above
the
surface
in
vast
cyclonic
storms
producing
so
rapid
a
motion
that
a
column
of
incandescent
gas
may
move
ten
thousand
miles
in
less
than
ten
minutes
whether
these
great
streaks
were
in
part
electrical
phenomena
similar
to
the
aurora
borealis
or
entirely
of
intensely
heated
material
thrown
up
by
explosions
within
the
sun
mass
they
could
not
tell
even
from
their
point
of
vantage
i
believe
said
cortlandt
pointing
to
the
streamers
that
they
are
masses
of
gas
thrown
beyond
the
sun
atmosphere
which
expand
enormously
when
the
pressure
to
which
they
are
subjected
in
the
sun
is
removed
for
only
in
space
freed
from
resistance
could
they
move
at
such
velocities
and
that
their
brilliancy
is
increased
by
great
electrical
disturbance
if
they
were
entirely
the
play
of
electrical
forces
their
change
of
place
would
be
practically
instantaneous
which
however
rapid
their
movement
is
not
the
case
book
ii
chapter
i
the
last
of
the
earth
finding
that
they
were
rapidly
swinging
towards
their
proper
course
and
that
the
earth
in
its
journey
about
the
sun
would
move
out
of
their
way
they
divided
their
power
between
repelling
the
body
they
had
left
and
increasing
the
attraction
of
the
moon
and
then
set
about
getting
their
house
in
order
bearwarden
having
the
largest
appetite
was
elected
cook
the
others
sagely
divining
that
labour
so
largely
for
himself
would
be
no
trial
their
small
but
electric
range
was
therefore
soon
in
full
blast
with
bearwarden
in
command
it
had
enough
current
to
provide
heat
for
cooking
for
four
hundred
hours
which
was
an
ample
margin
and
it
had
this
advantage
that
no
matter
how
much
it
was
used
it
could
not
exhaust
the
air
as
any
other
form
of
heat
would
there
were
also
a
number
of
incandescent
lamps
so
that
when
passing
through
the
shadow
of
a
planet
or
at
night
after
their
arrival
on
jupiter
their
car
would
be
brightly
illuminated
they
had
also
a
good
for
examining
the
dark
side
of
a
satellite
or
exploring
the
spaces
in
rings
having
lunched
sumptuously
on
canned
chicken
soup
beef
a
la
jardiniere
and
pheasant
that
had
been
sent
them
by
some
of
their
admirers
that
morning
they
put
the
bones
and
the
glass
can
that
had
contained
the
soup
into
the
partition
or
vestibule
placing
a
large
sheet
of
cardboard
to
act
as
a
wad
between
the
scraps
and
the
outside
door
by
pressing
a
button
they
unfastened
the
outside
door
and
the
articles
to
be
disposed
of
were
shot
off
by
the
expansion
of
the
air
between
the
cardboard
disk
and
the
inside
door
after
which
the
outside
door
was
drawn
back
to
its
place
by
a
current
sent
through
a
magnet
but
little
power
being
required
to
reclose
it
with
no
resisting
atmospheric
pressure
as
the
electricity
ran
along
a
wire
passing
through
a
hermetically
sealed
opening
in
the
floor
there
was
no
way
by
which
more
air
than
that
in
the
vestibule
could
escape
and
as
the
somewhat
flat
space
between
the
doors
contained
less
than
one
cubic
foot
the
pressure
inside
the
callisto
could
not
be
materially
lessened
by
a
few
openings
by
filling
the
vestibule
as
full
as
possible
said
bearwarden
and
so
displacing
most
of
its
air
we
shall
be
able
to
open
the
outside
door
oftener
without
danger
of
rarefaction
the
things
they
had
discharged
flew
off
with
considerable
speed
and
were
soon
out
of
sight
but
it
was
not
necessary
for
them
to
move
fast
provided
they
moved
at
all
for
the
resistance
being
nil
they
would
be
sure
to
go
beyond
the
range
of
vision
provided
enough
time
was
allowed
even
if
the
callisto
speed
was
not
being
increased
by
apergy
in
which
case
articles
outside
and
not
affected
would
be
quickly
left
behind
the
earth
which
at
first
had
filled
nearly
half
their
sky
was
rapidly
growing
smaller
being
almost
between
themselves
and
the
sun
it
looked
like
a
crescent
moon
and
when
it
was
only
about
twenty
times
the
size
of
the
moon
they
calculated
they
must
have
come
nearly
two
hundred
thousand
miles
the
moon
was
now
on
what
a
sailor
would
call
the
starboard
bow
to
the
right
and
ahead
being
a
little
more
than
three
quarters
full
and
only
about
fifty
thousand
miles
off
it
presented
a
splendid
sight
brilliant
as
polished
silver
and
about
times
as
large
as
they
had
ever
before
seen
it
with
the
unaided
eye
it
was
just
ten
hours
since
they
had
started
and
at
that
moment
in
new
york
but
though
it
was
night
there
the
callisto
was
bathed
in
a
flood
of
sunlight
such
as
never
shines
on
earth
the
only
night
they
would
have
was
on
the
side
of
the
callisto
turned
away
from
the
sun
unless
they
passed
through
some
shadow
which
they
intended
to
avoid
on
account
of
the
danger
of
colliding
with
a
meteor
in
the
dark
the
moon
and
the
callisto
were
moving
on
converging
lines
the
curve
on
which
they
had
entered
having
swung
them
to
the
side
nearest
the
earth
but
they
saw
that
their
own
tremendous
and
increasing
speed
would
carry
them
in
front
of
the
moon
in
its
nearly
circular
orbit
wishing
to
change
the
direction
of
their
flight
by
the
moon
attraction
they
shut
off
the
power
driving
them
from
the
earth
whereupon
the
callisto
turned
its
heavy
base
towards
the
moon
they
were
already
moving
at
such
speed
that
their
momentum
alone
would
carry
them
hundreds
of
thousands
of
miles
into
space
and
were
then
almost
abreast
of
the
earth
satellite
which
was
but
a
few
thousand
miles
away
the
spectacle
was
magnificent
as
they
looked
at
it
through
their
field
glasses
or
with
the
unaided
eye
the
great
cracks
and
craters
showed
with
the
utmost
clearness
sweeping
past
them
almost
as
the
landscape
flies
past
a
railway
train
there
was
something
in
the
vast
antiquity
of
that
furrowed
lunar
surface
by
far
the
oldest
thing
that
mortal
eye
can
see
since
while
observing
the
ceaseless
political
or
geological
changes
on
earth
the
face
of
this
dead
satellite
on
account
of
the
absence
of
air
and
water
and
consequent
erosion
has
remained
unchanged
for
bygone
ages
as
it
doubtless
will
for
many
more
they
closely
watched
the
callisto
course
at
first
it
did
not
seem
to
deflect
from
a
straight
line
and
they
stood
ready
to
turn
on
the
apergetic
force
again
when
the
car
very
slowly
began
to
show
the
effect
of
the
moon
near
pull
but
not
till
they
had
so
far
passed
it
that
the
dark
side
was
towards
them
were
they
heading
straight
for
jupiter
then
they
again
turned
on
full
power
and
got
a
shove
on
the
moon
and
earth
combined
which
increased
their
speed
so
rapidly
that
they
felt
they
could
soon
shut
off
the
current
altogether
and
save
their
supply
we
must
be
ready
to
watch
the
signals
from
the
arctic
circle
said
bearwarden
at
midnight
if
the
calculations
are
finished
the
result
will
be
flashed
by
the
searchlight
it
was
then
ten
minutes
to
twelve
and
the
earth
was
already
over
four
hundred
thousand
miles
away
focusing
their
glasses
upon
the
region
near
the
north
pole
which
being
turned
from
the
sun
was
towards
them
and
in
darkness
they
waited
in
this
blaze
of
sunlight
said
cortlandt
i
am
afraid
we
can
see
nothing
fortunately
at
this
moment
the
callisto
entered
the
tapering
shadow
this
said
ayrault
is
good
luck
we
could
of
course
have
gone
into
the
shadow
but
to
change
our
course
would
have
delayed
us
and
we
might
have
lost
part
of
the
chance
of
increasing
our
speed
there
will
be
no
danger
from
meteors
or
here
said
bearwarden
for
anything
revolving
about
the
moon
at
this
distance
would
be
caught
by
the
earth
the
sun
had
apparently
set
behind
the
moon
and
they
were
eclipsed
the
stars
shone
with
the
utmost
splendour
against
the
sky
and
the
earth
appeared
as
a
large
crescent
still
considerably
larger
than
the
satellite
to
which
they
were
accustomed
exactly
at
midnight
a
faint
phosphorescent
light
like
that
of
a
appeared
in
the
region
of
greenland
on
the
planet
they
had
left
it
gradually
increased
its
strength
till
it
shone
like
a
long
white
beam
projected
from
a
lighthouse
and
in
this
they
beheld
the
work
of
the
greatest
ever
made
by
man
receiving
for
a
few
moments
all
the
electricity
generated
by
the
available
dynamos
at
niagara
and
the
bay
of
fundy
the
steam
engines
and
other
sources
of
power
in
the
northern
hemisphere
the
beam
lasted
with
growing
intensity
for
one
minute
it
then
spelled
out
with
intervals
according
to
the
cable
code
no
the
southern
hemisphere

are
now
raising
and
storing

at

we
have
already
begun
to
lower
the
arctic
ocean
victory
shouted
bearwarden
in
an
ecstasy
of
delight
nearly
half
a
degree
in
six
months
with
but
one
pole
working
if
we
can
add
at
this
rate
each
time
to
the
speed
of
straightening
already
acquired
we
can
reverse
our
engines
in
five
years
and
in
five
more
the
earth
will
be
at
rest
and
right
look
said
ayrault
they
are
sending
something
else
the
flashes
came
in
rapid
succession
reaching
far
into
space
with
their
glasses
fixed
upon
them
they
made
out
these
sentences
our
telescopes
in
whatever
part
of
the
earth

followed
you
since
you

you
will
be
in
darkness
till
when
we
shall
see
you
again
on
receiving
this
last
earthly
message
the
travellers
sprang
to
their
searchlight
and
using
its
full
power
telegraphed
back
the
following
many
thanks
to
you
for
good

us
to

approaching
this
was
read
by
the
men
in
the
great
observatories
who
evidently
telephoned
to
the
arctic

immediately
for
it
flashed
back
got
your
message
perfectly
wish
you
greatest
luck
the
has
decked
the
callisto
pedestal
with
flowers
and
has
ordered
a
tablet
set
up
on
the
site
to
commemorate
your
celestial
journey
at
that
moment
the
shadow
swept
by
and
they
were
in
the
full
blaze
of
cloudless
day
the
change
was
so
great
that
for
a
moment
they
were
obliged
to
close
their
eyes
the
polished
sides
of
the
callisto
shone
so
brightly
that
they
knew
they
were
easily
seen
the
power
temporarily
diverted
in
sending
them
the
message
then
returned
to
the
work
of
draining
the
arctic
ocean
which
as
the
north
pole
was
now
returning
to
the
sun
was
the
thing
to
do
and
the
travellers
resumed
their
study
of
the
heavenly
bodies
chapter
ii
space
and
mars
never
before
had
the
travellers
observed
the
stars
and
planets
under
such
favourable
conditions
no
air
or
clouds
intervened
and
as
the
callisto
did
not
revolve
on
its
axis
there
was
no
necessity
for
changing
the
direction
of
the
glasses
after
an
hour
of
this
interesting
work
however
as
it
was
already
late
at
the
longitude
they
had
left
on
earth
and
as
they
knew
they
had
many
days
in
space
before
them
they
prepared
to
go
to
bed
when
ready
they
had
only
to
pull
down
the
shades
for
as
apergy
was
not
applied
to
them
but
only
to
the
callisto
they
still
looked
upon
the
floor
as
down
and
closed
the
heavy
curtains
to
have
night
or
darkness
they
found
that
the
side
of
the
callisto
turned
constantly
towards
the
sun
was
becoming
very
warm
the
glass
windows
making
it
like
a
greenhouse
but
they
consoled
themselves
with
the
thought
that
the
sun
power
on
them
was
hourly
becoming
less
and
they
felt
sure
the
double
walls
and
thick
upholstery
would
protect
them
almost
anywhere
within
the
solar
system
from
the
intense
cold
of
space
we
could
easily
have
arranged
said
ayrault
for
night
and
day
on
alternate
sides
of
the
callisto
by
having
strips
of
metal
arranged
spirally
on
the
outside
as
on
the
end
of
an
arrow
these
would
have
started
us
turning
as
slowly
as
we
like
since
we
passed
through
the
atmosphere
at
a
comparatively
low
rate
of
speed
i
am
afraid
said
cortlandt
the
motion
however
slow
would
have
made
us
dizzy
it
would
be
confusing
to
see
the
heavens
turning
about
us
and
it
would
interfere
with
using
the
glasses
the
base
and
one
side
of
the
callisto
had
constant
sunshine
while
the
other
side
and
the
dome
were
in
the
blackest
night
this
dome
on
account
of
its
shape
sky
windows
and
the
completeness
with
which
it
could
be
isolated
was
an
ideal
observatory
and
there
was
seldom
a
time
during
their
waking
hours
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
when
it
was
not
occupied
by
one
two
or
all
the
observers
there
is
something
marvellous
said
cortlandt
about
the
condition
of
space
its
absolute
cold
is
appalling
apparently
because
there
is
nothing
to
absorb
heat
yet
we
find
the
base
of
this
material
projectile
uncomfortably
warm
though
should
we
expose
a
thermometer
in
the
shade
in
front
we
know
it
would
show
a
temperature
of
three
hundred
to
four
hundred
degrees
below
zero
were
the
instrument
capable
of
recording
it
artificial
darkness
having
been
obtained
the
travellers
were
soon
asleep
bearwarden
dreams
being
regaled
with
thoughts
of
his
company
triumph
ayrault
naturally
with
visions
of
sylvia
while
cortlandt
frequently
started
up
thinking
he
had
already
made
some
great
astronomical
discovery
about
according
to
meridian
time
the
explorers
awoke
feeling
greatly
refreshed
the
tank
in
which
the
liquefied
oxygen
was
kept
automatically
gave
off
its
gas
so
evenly
that
the
air
remained
normal
while
the
lime
contained
in
cups
absorbed
the
carbon
dioxide
as
fast
as
they
exhaled
it
they
had
darkened
those
windows
through
which
the
sun
was
actually
pouring
for
on
account
of
the
emptiness
of
the
surrounding
ether
and
consequent
absence
of
diffusion
of
light
nothing
but
the
inky
blackness
of
space
and
the
bright
stars
looked
in
at
the
rest
on
raising
the
shades
they
got
an
idea
of
their
speed
a
small
crescent
smaller
than
the
familiar
moon
accompanied
by
one
still
tinier
was
all
that
could
be
seen
of
the
earth
and
its
satellite
we
must
said
bearwarden
be
moving
at
the
rate
of
nearly
a
million
miles
an
hour
from
the
way
we
have
travelled
we
must
be
doing
fully
a
million
replied
cortlandt
for
by
this
time
we
are
pretty
well
in
motion
having
got
a
tremendous
start
when
so
near
the
moon
with
it
and
the
earth
in
line
by
steering
straight
for
jupiter
instead
of
for
the
place
it
would
occupy
ten
days
later
they
knew
they
would
swing
past
for
the
giant
planet
being
in
rapid
motion
would
advance
but
they
did
not
object
to
this
since
it
would
give
them
a
chance
to
examine
their
new
world
in
case
they
wished
to
do
so
before
alighting
while
if
they
preferred
to
land
at
once
they
could
easily
change
their
course
by
means
of
the
moons
the
fourth
from
which
their
car
was
named
being
the
one
that
they
knew
would
be
of
most
use
their
tremendous
speed
showed
them
they
should
have
time
for
exploration
on
their
arrival
and
that
they
would
reach
their
destination
sooner
than
they
had
expected
the
apergetic
force
being
applied
as
we
have
seen
only
to
the
callisto
just
as
power
in
starting
is
exerted
on
a
carriage
or
railway
car
and
only
through
it
to
the
passengers
ayrault
and
his
companions
had
no
unusual
sensation
except
loss
of
weight
for
when
they
were
so
far
from
the
earth
its
attraction
was
very
slight
and
no
other
planet
was
near
enough
to
take
its
place
after
breakfast
wishing
to
reach
the
dome
and
realizing
that
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
climb
each
in
turn
gave
a
slight
spring
and
was
obliged
to
put
up
his
hands
to
avoid
striking
the
roof
in
the
cool
quiet
of
the
dark
dome
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
only
twenty
feet
away
the
sun
was
shining
with
such
intensity
upon
the
metal
base
as
to
make
it
too
hot
on
the
inside
to
touch
without
gloves
the
first
thing
that
attracted
their
attention
was
the
size
and
brilliance
of
mars
although
this
red
planet
was
over
forty
million
miles
from
the
earth
when
they
started
they
calculated
that
it
was
less
than
thirty
million
miles
from
them
now
or
five
millions
nearer
than
it
had
ever
been
to
them
before
this
reduction
in
distance
and
the
clearness
of
the
void
through
which
they
saw
it
made
it
a
splendid
sight
its
disk
showing
clearly
from
hour
to
hour
its
size
and
brightness
increased
till
towards
evening
it
looked
like
a
small
full
moon
the
sun
shining
squarely
upon
it
they
calculated
that
on
the
course
they
were
moving
they
should
pass
about
nine
hundred
thousand
miles
to
the
right
or
behind
it
since
it
was
moving
towards
their
left
they
were
interested
to
see
what
effect
the
mass
of
mars
would
have
on
the
callisto
and
saw
here
a
chance
of
still
further
increasing
their
speed
notwithstanding
its
tremendous
rate
they
expected
to
see
the
callisto
swerve
from
its
straight
line
and
move
towards
mars
whose
orbital
speed
of
nine
hundred
miles
a
minute
they
thought
would
take
it
out
of
the
way
so
that
no
actual
collision
would
occur
even
if
their
were
left
to
her
own
devices
towards
evening
they
noticed
through
their
glasses
that
several
apparently
island
peaks
in
the
southern
hemisphere
which
was
turned
towards
them
became
white
from
which
they
concluded
that
a
was
in
progress
the
south
polar
region
was
also
markedly
glaciated
though
the
icecap
was
not
as
extensive
as
either
of
those
at
the
poles
of
the
earth
as
the
martian
winters
must
be
fully
as
severe
as
ours
said
cortlandt
on
account
of
their
length
the
planet
distance
from
the
sun
and
the
and
a
half
degrees
inclination
of
its
axis
we
can
account
for
the
smallness
of
its
only
by
the
fact
that
its
oceans
cover
but
one
fourth
of
its
surface
instead
of
three
quarters
as
on
the
earth
and
there
is
consequently
a
smaller
evaporation
and
rain
and
they
were
too
much
interested
to
think
of
sleeping
that
night
and
so
after
dining
comfortably
returned
to
their
observatory
when
within
four
million
miles
of
mars
the
callisto
began
to
swerve
perceptibly
its
curve
as
when
near
the
moon
beginning
with
a
spiral
they
swung
on
unconcernedly
however
knowing
they
could
check
their
approach
at
any
time
soon
mars
appeared
to
have
a
diameter
ten
times
as
great
as
that
of
the
moon
and
promised
shortly
to
occupy
almost
one
side
of
their
sky
we
must
be
on
the
lookout
for
the
satellites
said
cortlandt
a
collision
with
either
would
be
worse
than
a
wreck
on
a
desert
island
they
therefore
turned
their
glasses
in
the
direction
of
the
satellites
until
hall
at
washington
discovered
the
two
satellites
in
he
continued
mars
was
supposed
to
be
without
moons
the
outer
one
deimos
is
but
six
miles
in
diameter
and
revolves
about
its
primary
in
thirty
hours
and
eighteen
minutes
at
a
distance
of
fourteen
thousand
six
hundred
miles
as
it
takes
but
little
longer
to
complete
a
revolution
than
mars
does
to
rotate
on
its
axis
it
remains
in
the
martial
sky
one
hundred
and
hours
between
rising
and
setting
passing
through
all
the
phases
from
new
moon
to
full
and
back
again
four
times
that
is
it
swings
four
times
around
mars
before
going
below
the
horizon
it
is
one
of
the
smallest
bodies
discovered
with
a
telescope
the
inner
one
phobos
is
considerably
larger
having
a
diameter
of
about
twenty
miles
it
is
but
hundred
miles
from
mars
surface
and
completes
its
revolution
in
seven
hours
and
minutes
which
is
shorter
than
any
other
known
period
jupiter
nearest
moon
being
the
next
with
eleven
hours
and
nine
minutes
it
thus
revolves
in
less
than
a
third
of
the
time
mars
takes
to
rotate
and
must
consequently
rise
in
the
west
and
set
in
the
east
as
it
is
continually
running
ahead
of
the
surface
of
the
planet
though
the
sun
and
all
the
other
stars
rise
and
set
on
mars
in
the
same
way
as
on
the
earth
when
about
fifteen
thousand
miles
from
mars
they
sighted
deimos
directly
ahead
and
saw
that
they
should
pass
on
its
left
behind
for
it
was
moving
across
them
the
sun
poured
directly
upon
it
making
it
appear
full
and
showing
all
its
features
there
were
small
unevennesses
on
the
surface
apparently
seventy
or
a
hundred
feet
high
which
were
the
nearest
approach
to
mountains
and
they
ran
in
ridges
or
chains
there
were
also
unmistakable
signs
of
volcanic
action
the
craters
being
large
compared
with
the
size
of
the
planet
but
shallow
they
saw
no
signs
of
water
and
the
blackness
of
the
shadows
convinced
them
there
was
no
air
they
secured
two
instantaneous
photographs
of
the
little
satellite
as
the
callisto
swept
by
and
resumed
their
inspection
of
mars
they
noticed
red
and
brownish
patches
on
the
peaks
that
had
that
morning
turned
white
from
which
they
concluded
that
the
show
had
begun
to
melt
under
the
warm
spring
sun
this
strengthened
the
belief
they
had
already
formed
that
on
account
of
its
and
a
half
degrees
inclination
the
changes
in
temperature
on
mars
must
be
great
and
sudden
so
interested
were
they
with
this
that
they
did
not
at
first
see
a
large
and
bright
body
moving
rapidly
on
a
course
that
converged
with
theirs
we
must
be
ready
to
repel
boarders
said
bearwarden
observing
it
for
the
first
time
and
fixing
his
glass
upon
it
that
must
be
phobos
not
ten
miles
off
they
beheld
mars
inner
moon
and
though
their
own
speed
caused
them
to
overtake
and
rush
by
it
like
a
whirlwind
the
satellite
rapid
motion
in
its
orbit
in
a
course
temporarily
almost
parallel
with
theirs
served
to
give
them
a
chance
the
better
to
examine
it
here
the
mountain
ranges
were
considerably
more
conspicuous
than
on
deimos
and
there
were
boulders
and
loose
stones
upon
their
slopes
which
looked
as
if
there
might
at
some
time
have
been
frost
and
water
on
its
surface
but
it
was
all
dry
now
neither
was
there
any
air
the
evidences
of
volcanic
action
were
also
plainly
visible
while
a
noticeable
flattening
at
the
poles
showed
that
the
little
body
had
once
rotated
rapidly
on
its
axis
though
whether
it
did
so
still
they
had
not
time
to
ascertain
when
abreast
of
it
they
were
less
than
two
miles
distant
and
they
secured
several
instantaneous
impressions
which
they
put
aside
to
develop
later
as
the
radius
of
phobos
circle
was
far
shorter
than
that
of
the
parabolic
curve
they
were
making
it
began
to
draw
away
and
was
rapidly
left
behind
applying
the
full
apergetic
force
to
mars
and
the
larger
moon
they
shot
away
like
an
arrow
having
had
their
speed
increased
by
the
planet
attraction
while
approaching
it
and
subsequently
by
repulsion
either
of
those
said
bearwarden
looking
back
at
the
little
satellites
would
be
a
nice
yacht
for
a
man
to
explore
space
on
he
would
also
of
course
need
a
sun
to
warm
him
if
he
wished
to
go
beyond
this
system
but
that
would
not
have
to
be
a
large
affair
in
fact
it
might
be
smaller
than
the
planet
and
could
revolve
about
it
like
a
moon
though
a
sun
of
that
size
replied
cortlandt
might
retain
its
heat
for
the
time
you
wished
to
use
it
the
planet
part
would
be
nothing
like
as
comfortable
as
what
we
have
here
for
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
get
enough
to
breathe
on
so
small
a
body
since
with
its
slight
to
secure
fifteen
pounds
to
the
square
inch
or
anything
like
it
the
atmosphere
would
have
to
extend
thousands
of
miles
into
space
so
that
on
a
cloudy
day
you
would
be
in
darkness
it
would
be
better
therefore
to
have
such
a
sun
as
you
describe
and
accompany
it
in
a
yacht
or
private
car
like
this
well
stocked
with
oxygen
and
provisions
when
passing
through
meteoric
swarms
or
masses
of
solid
matter
collision
with
which
is
the
most
serious
risk
we
run
the
car
could
follow
behind
its
sun
instead
of
revolving
around
it
and
be
kept
from
falling
into
it
by
partially
reversing
the
attraction
as
the
gravitation
of
so
small
a
sun
would
be
slight
counteracting
it
for
even
a
considerable
time
would
take
but
little
from
the
batteries
there
are
known
to
be
several
unclaimed
masses
added
ayrault
with
diameters
of
a
few
hundred
yards
revolving
about
the
earth
inside
the
orbit
of
the
moon
if
in
some
way
two
of
these
could
be
brought
into
sufficiently
violent
collision
they
would
become
luminous
and
answer
very
well
the
increase
in
bulk
as
a
result
of
the
consolidation
and
the
subsequent
heat
about
serving
to
bring
them
to
the
required
size
whenever
this
sun
showed
spots
and
indications
of
cooling
it
could
be
made
to
collide
with
the
solid
head
of
some
comet
or
small
asteroid
till
its
temperature
was
again
right
while
if
as
a
result
of
these
accretions
it
became
unwieldy
it
could
be
caused
to
rotate
with
sufficient
rapidity
on
its
axis
to
split
and
we
should
have
two
suns
instead
of
one
bravo
said
bearwarden
there
is
no
limit
to
what
can
be
done
the
idea
of
our
present
trip
would
have
seemed
more
chimerical
to
people
a
hundred
years
ago
than
this
new
scheme
appears
now
thus
they
sat
and
talked
or
studied
maps
and
charts
or
the
stars
themselves
while
the
hours
quickly
passed
and
they
shot
through
space
they
had
now
a
straight
stretch
of
over
three
hundred
million
miles
and
had
to
cross
the
orbits
of
innumerable
asteroids
on
the
way
the
apparent
size
of
the
sun
had
by
this
time
considerably
decreased
and
the
interior
of
the
callisto
was
no
longer
uncomfortably
warm
they
divided
the
day
into
hours
from
force
of
habit
and
drew
the
shades
tightly
during
what
they
considered
night
while
bearwarden
distinguished
himself
as
a
cook
chapter
iii
heavenly
bodies
the
following
day
while
in
their
observatory
they
saw
something
not
many
miles
ahead
they
watched
it
for
hours
and
in
fact
all
day
but
notwithstanding
their
tremendous
speed
they
came
but
little
nearer
they
say
a
stern
chase
is
a
long
one
said
bearwarden
but
that
beats
anything
i
have
ever
seen
after
a
while
however
they
found
they
were
nearer
the
time
taken
having
been
in
part
due
to
the
deceptive
distance
which
was
greater
than
they
supposed
a
comet
exclaimed
cortlandt
excitedly
we
shall
really
be
able
to
examine
it
near
it
going
in
our
direction
said
ayrault
and
at
almost
exactly
our
speed
while
the
sun
shone
full
upon
it
they
brought
their
camera
into
play
and
again
succeeded
in
photographing
a
heavenly
body
at
close
range
the
nucleus
or
head
was
of
course
turned
towards
the
sun
while
the
tail
which
they
could
see
faintly
preceded
it
as
the
comet
was
receding
towards
the
cold
and
dark
depths
of
space
the
head
was
only
a
few
miles
in
diameter
for
it
was
a
small
comet
and
was
composed
of
grains
and
masses
of
stone
and
meteoric
iron
many
of
the
grains
were
no
larger
than
peas
or
no
mass
was
more
than
four
feet
in
diameter
and
all
of
them
had
very
irregular
shapes
the
space
between
the
particles
was
never
less
than
one
hundred
times
their
masses
we
can
move
about
within
it
said
ayrault
as
the
callisto
entered
the
aggregation
of
particles
and
moved
slowly
forward
among
them
the
windows
in
the
dome
being
made
of
toughened
glass
set
somewhat
slantingly
so
as
to
deflect
anything
touching
them
and
having
moreover
the
pressure
of
the
inside
air
to
sustain
them
were
fairly
safe
while
the
windows
in
the
sides
and
base
were
but
little
exposed
whenever
a
large
mass
seemed
dangerously
near
the
glass
they
applied
an
apergetic
shock
to
it
and
sent
it
kiting
among
its
fellows
at
these
times
the
callisto
recoiled
slightly
also
the
resulting
motion
in
either
being
in
inverse
ratio
to
its
weight
there
was
constant
and
incessant
movement
among
the
individual
fragments
but
it
was
not
rotary
nothing
seemed
to
be
revolving
about
anything
else
all
were
moving
apparently
swinging
back
and
forth
but
no
collisions
took
place
when
the
separate
particles
got
more
than
a
certain
distance
apart
they
reapproached
one
another
but
when
seemingly
within
about
one
hundred
diameters
of
each
other
they
swung
off
in
some
other
direction
the
motion
was
like
that
of
innumerable
which
may
approach
but
never
strike
one
another
after
a
time
the
callisto
seemed
to
become
endowed
with
the
same
property
that
the
fragments
possessed
for
it
and
they
repelled
one
another
on
a
near
approach
after
which
nothing
came
very
near
much
of
the
material
was
like
slag
from
a
furnace
having
evidently
been
partly
fused
whether
this
heat
was
the
result
of
collision
or
of
its
near
approach
to
the
sun
at
perihelion
they
could
not
tell
though
the
latter
explanation
seemed
most
simple
and
probable
when
at
about
the
centre
of
the
nucleus
they
were
in
not
twilight
for
any
ray
that
succeeded
in
penetrating
was
dazzlingly
brilliant
and
the
shadows
their
own
included
were
inky
black
as
they
approached
the
farther
side
and
the
sunlight
decreased
they
found
that
a
diffused
luminosity
pervaded
everything
it
was
sufficiently
bright
to
enable
them
to
see
the
dark
side
of
the
meteoric
masses
and
on
emerging
from
the
nucleus
in
total
darkness
they
found
the
shadow
stretching
thousands
of
miles
before
them
into
space
i
now
understand
said
bearwarden
why
stars
of
the
sixth
and
seventh
magnitude
can
be
seen
through
thousands
of
miles
of
a
comet
tail
it
is
simply
because
there
is
nothing
in
it
the
reason
any
stars
are
obscured
is
because
the
light
in
the
tail
however
faint
is
brighter
than
they
and
that
light
is
all
that
the
caudal
appendage
consists
of
though
what
produces
it
i
confess
i
am
unable
to
explain
i
also
see
why
the
tail
always
stretches
away
from
the
sun
because
near
by
it
is
overwhelmed
by
the
more
powerful
light
in
fact
i
suspect
it
is
principally
in
the
comet
shadow
that
the
tail
is
visible
it
is
strange
that
no
one
ever
thought
of
that
before
or
that
any
one
feared
the
earth
passing
through
the
tail
of
a
comet
it
is
obvious
to
me
now
that
if
there
were
any
material
substance
any
gas
however
rarefied
in
this
hairlike
accompaniment
it
would
immediately
fall
to
the
comparatively
heavy
head
and
surround
that
as
a
centre
comet
means
literally
a
hair
how
then
asked
cortlandt
do
you
account
for
the
spaces
between
those
stones
however
slight
gravitation
might
be
between
some
of
the
grains
if
it
existed
at
all
or
was
unopposed
by
some
other
force
with
sufficient
time
and
they
have
eternity
every
comet
would
come
together
like
a
planet
into
one
solid
mass
perhaps
some
similar
force
maintains
gases
in
the
distended
tail
though
i
know
of
no
such
or
even
any
analogous
manifestation
on
earth
if
the
law
on
which
we
have
been
brought
up
that
atom
in
the
universe
attracts
every
other
atom
were
without
exceptions
or
modifications
that
comet
could
not
continue
to
exist
in
its
present
form
until
we
get
some
additional
illustration
however
we
shall
be
short
of
data
with
which
to
formulate
any
iconoclastic
hypothesis
the
source
of
the
light
i
must
admit
also
puzzles
me
greatly
there
is
certainly
no
heat
to
which
we
can
attribute
it
having
gone
beyond
the
fragments
they
applied
a
strong
repulsion
charge
to
the
comet
creating
thereby
a
perfect
whirlpool
among
its
particles
and
quickly
left
it
half
an
hour
later
they
again
shut
off
the
current
as
the
callisto
speed
was
sufficient
for
some
time
they
had
been
in
the
belt
of
asteroids
but
as
yet
they
had
seen
none
near
the
morning
following
their
experience
with
the
comet
however
they
went
to
their
observatory
after
breakfast
as
usual
and
on
pointing
their
glasses
forward
espied
a
comparatively
large
body
before
them
a
little
to
their
right
that
must
be
pallas
said
cortlandt
scrutinizing
it
closely
it
was
discovered
by
olbers
in
and
was
the
second
asteroid
found
ceres
having
been
the
first
in
it
has
a
diameter
of
about
three
hundred
miles
being
one
of
the
largest
of
these
small
planets
the
most
wonderful
thing
about
it
is
the
inclination
of
its
orbit
degrees
to
the
plane
of
the
ecliptic
which
means
that
at
each
revolution
in
its
orbit
it
swings
that
much
above
and
below
the
imaginary
plane
cutting
the
sun
at
its
equator
from
which
the
earth
and
other
larger
planets
vary
but
little
this
no
doubt
is
due
to
the
near
approach
and
disturbing
attraction
of
some
large
comet
or
else
it
was
flung
above
or
below
the
ordinary
plane
in
the
catastrophe
that
we
think
befell
the
large
planet
that
doubtless
formerly
existed
where
we
now
find
this
swarm
you
can
see
that
its
path
makes
a
considerable
angle
to
the
plane
of
the
ecliptic
and
that
it
is
now
about
crossing
the
line
it
soon
presented
the
phase
of
a
half
moon
but
the
waviness
of
the
straight
line
as
in
the
case
of
venus
and
mercury
showed
that
the
size
of
the
mountains
must
be
tremendous
compared
with
the
mass
of
the
body
some
of
them
being
obviously
fifteen
miles
high
the
intense
blackness
of
the
shadows
as
on
the
moon
convinced
them
there
was
no
trace
of
atmosphere
there
being
no
air
said
cortlandt
it
is
safe
to
assume
there
is
no
water
which
helps
to
account
for
the
great
inequalities
on
the
body
surface
since
the
mountains
will
seem
higher
when
surrounded
by
dry
bottom
than
they
would
if
water
came
halfway
up
their
sides
undoubtedly
however
the
main
cause
of
their
height
is
the
slight
effect
of
gravitation
on
an
asteroid
and
the
fact
that
the
shrinking
of
the
interior
and
consequent
folding
of
the
crust
in
ridges
may
have
continued
for
a
time
after
there
was
no
longer
water
on
the
surface
to
cut
them
down
the
temperature
and
condition
of
a
body
continued
cortlandt
seem
to
depend
entirely
on
its
size
in
the
sun
we
have
an
incandescent
gaseous
star
though
its
spots
and
the
colour
of
its
rays
show
that
it
is
becoming
aged
or
to
be
more
accurate
advanced
in
its
evolutionary
development
then
comes
a
great
jump
for
jupiter
has
but
about
one
of
the
mass
of
the
sun
and
we
expect
to
find
on
it
a
firm
crust
and
that
the
planet
itself
is
at
about
the
fourth
or
fifth
period
of
development
described
by
moses
as
days
saturn
is
doubtless
somewhat
more
advanced
the
earth
we
know
has
been
habitable
many
hundreds
of
thousands
or
millions
of
years
though
three
fourths
of
its
surface
is
still
covered
by
water
in
mars
we
see
a
further
step
three
fourths
of
its
surface
being
land
in
mercury
could
we
study
it
better
or
in
the
larger
satellites
of
jupiter
or
saturn
we
might
find
a
from
mars
to
the
moon
perhaps
with
no
water
but
still
having
air
and
being
habitable
in
all
other
respects
in
our
own
satellite
we
see
a
world
that
has
died
though
its
death
from
an
astronomical
point
of
view
is
comparatively
recent
while
this
little
pallas
has
been
dead
longer
being
probably
chilled
through
and
through
from
this
i
conclude
that
all
bodies
in
the
solar
system
had
one
genesis
and
were
part
of
the
same
nebulous
mass
but
this
does
not
include
the
other
systems
and
nebulae
for
compared
with
them
our
sun
as
we
have
seen
is
itself
advanced
and
small
beside
such
stars
as
sirius
having
diameters
of
twelve
million
miles
as
they
left
pallas
between
themselves
and
the
sun
it
became
a
crescent
and
finally
disappeared
two
days
later
they
sighted
another
asteroid
exactly
ahead
they
examined
it
closely
and
concluded
it
must
be
hilda
put
down
in
the
astronomies
as
no
and
having
almost
the
greatest
mean
distance
of
any
of
these
small
bodies
from
the
sun
when
they
were
so
near
that
the
disk
was
plainly
visible
to
the
unaided
eye
hilda
passed
between
them
and
jupiter
eclipsing
it
to
their
surprise
the
light
was
not
instantly
shut
off
as
when
the
moon
occults
a
star
but
there
was
evident
refraction
by
george
said
bearwarden
here
is
an
asteroid
that
has
an
atmosphere
there
was
no
mistaking
it
they
soon
discovered
a
small
at
one
pole
and
then
made
out
oceans
and
continents
with
mountains
forests
rivers
and
green
fields
the
sight
lasted
but
a
few
moments
before
they
swept
by
but
they
secured
several
photographs
and
carried
a
vivid
impression
in
their
minds
hilda
appeared
to
be
about
two
hundred
miles
in
diameter
how
do
you
account
for
that
living
world
bearwarden
asked
cortlandt
on
your
theory
of
size
and
longevity
there
are
two
explanations
replied
cortlandt
if
the
theory
as
i
still
believe
is
correct
hilda
has
either
been
brought
to
this
system
from
some
other
less
matured
in
the
train
of
a
comet
and
been
captured
by
the
immense
power
of
jupiter
which
might
account
for
the
eccentricity
of
its
orbit
or
some
accident
has
happened
to
rejuvenate
it
here
a
collision
with
another
minor
planet
moving
in
an
orbit
that
crossed
its
own
or
with
the
head
of
a
large
comet
would
have
reconverted
it
into
a
star
perhaps
after
it
had
long
been
cold
a
comet
may
first
have
so
changed
the
course
of
one
of
two
small
bodies
as
to
make
them
collide
this
seems
to
me
the
most
plausible
theory
over
a
hundred
years
ago
the
english
astronomer
chambers
wrote
of
having
found
traces
of
atmosphere
in
some
of
these
minor
planets
but
it
was
generally
thought
he
was
mistaken
one
reason
we
know
so
little
about
this
great
swarm
of
minor
planets
is
that
till
recently
none
of
them
showed
a
disk
to
the
telescope
inasmuch
as
only
their
light
was
visible
they
were
indistinguishable
from
stars
except
by
their
slow
motion
a
hundred
years
ago
only
three
hundred
and
fifty
had
been
discovered
our
photographic
have
since
then
shown
the
number
recorded
to
exceed
one
thousand

ayrault

also
a

been

puzzled
at
the

you

explained
on

we
shall
need

to
enable
us
to
make

while
on

they
will
not
be
necessary
the
increase
in
our
weight
as
a
result
of
that
planet
size
being
considerably
less
than
the
usual
load
carried
by
the
roman
soldier
i
do
not
imagine
said
cortlandt
we
should
long
be
troubled
by
gravitation
without
our
apergetic
outfits
even
on
jupiter
for
though
our
weight
will
be
more
than
doubled
we
can
take
off
one
quarter
of
the
whole
by
remaining
near
the
equator
their
rapid
rotation
having
apparently
been
given
providentially
to
all
the
large
planets
nature
will
adapt
herself
to
this
change
as
to
all
others
very
readily
although
the
reclamation
of
the
vast
areas
of
the
north
american
arctic
archipelago
alaska
siberia
and
antarctic
wilkes
land
from
the
of
the

in
which
they
have
been
held
will
relieve
the
pressure
of
population
for
another
century
at
the
end
of
that
time
it
will
surely
be
felt
again
it
is
therefore
a
consolation
to
feel
that
the
mighty
planets
jupiter
and
saturn
which
we
are
coming
to
look
upon
as
our
heritage
will
not
crush
the
life
out
of
any
human
beings
by
their
own
weight
that
may
alight
upon
them
before
going
to
bed
that
evening
they
decided
to
be
up
early
the
next
day
to
study
jupiter
which
was
already
a
brilliant
object
the
following
morning
on
awakening
they
went
at
once
to
their
observatory
and
found
that
jupiter
disk
was
plainly
visible
to
the
naked
eye
and
before
night
it
seemed
as
large
as
the
full
moon
they
then
prepared
to
check
the
callisto
headlong
speed
which
jupiter
attraction
was
beginning
to
increase
when
about
two
million
miles
from
the
great
planet
which
was
considerably
on
their
left
they
espied
callisto
ahead
and
slightly
on
their
right
as
deepwaters
had
calculated
it
would
be
applying
a
mild
repulsion
to
this
which
was
itself
quite
a
world
with
its
diameter
of
over
three
thousand
miles
though
evidently
as
cold
and
dead
as
the
earth
old
moon
they
retarded
their
forward
rush
knowing
that
the
resulting
motion
towards
jupiter
would
be
helped
by
the
giant
pull
wishing
to
be
in
good
condition
for
their
landing
they
divided
the
remainder
of
the
night
into
watches
two
going
to
sleep
at
a
time
the
man
on
duty
standing
by
to
control
the
course
and
to
get
photographic
negatives
on
which
when
they
were
developed
they
found
two
continents
a
speckled
region
and
a
number
of
islands
by
according
to
eastern
standard
time
they
were
but
fifty
thousand
miles
from
jupiter
surface
the
gigantic
globe
filling
nearly
one
side
of
the
sky
in
preparation
for
a
sally
they
got
their
guns
and
accoutrements
ready
and
then
gave
a
parting
glance
at
the
car
their
charge
of
electricity
for
developing
the
repulsion
seemed
scarcely
touched
and
they
had
still
an
abundant
supply
of
oxygen
and
provisions
the
barometer
registered
inches
showing
that
they
had
not
lost
much
air
in
the
numerous
openings
of
the
vestibule
the
pressure
was
about
what
would
be
found
at
an
altitude
of
a
few
hundred
feet
part
of
the
rarefaction
being
no
doubt
due
to
the
fact
that
they
did
not
close
the
windows
until
at
a
considerable
height
above
van
cortlandt
park
they
saw
they
should
alight
in
a
longitude
on
which
the
sun
had
just
risen
the
rocky
tops
of
the
great
mountains
shining
like
helmets
in
its
rays
soon
they
felt
a
sharp
checking
of
their
forward
motion
and
saw
from
the
changed
appearance
of
the
stars
and
the
sun
that
they
had
entered
the
atmosphere
of
their
new
home
not
even
did
columbus
standing
at
the
prow
of
the
santa
maria
with
the
new
world
before
him
feel
the
exultation
and
delight
experienced
by
these
explorers
of
the
century
their
first
adventures
on
landing
the
reader
already
knows
chapter
exploration
and
excitement
when
they
awoke
the
flowers
were
singing
with
the
volume
of
a
cathedral
organ
the
chant
rising
from
all
around
them
and
the
sun
was
already
above
the
horizon
finding
a
deep
natural
spring
in
which
the
water
was
at
about
they
prepared
for
breakfast
by
taking
a
bath
and
then
found
they
had
brought
nothing
to
eat
it
was
stupid
of
us
not
to
think
of
it
said
bearwarden
yet
it
will
be
too
much
out
of
our
way
to
return
to
the
callisto
we
have
two
rifles
and
a
gun
said
ayrault
and
have
also
plenty
of
water
and
wood
for
a
fire
all
we
need
is
game
the
old
excuse
that
it
has
been
already
shot
out
can
not
hold
here
said
cortlandt
seeing
that
we
have
neither
wings
nor
pneumatic
legs
and
not
knowing
the
advantage
given
us
by
our
rifles
added
bearwarden
it
should
not
be
shy
either
so
far
he
continued
we
have
seen
nothing
edible
though
just
now
we
should
not
be
too
particular
but
near
a
spring
like
this
that
kind
must
exist
the
question
is
said
the
professor
whether
the
game
like
warm
water
if
we
can
follow
this
stream
till
it
has
been
on
the
surface
for
some
time
or
till
it
spreads
out
we
shall
doubtless
find
a
huntsman
paradise
a
bright
idea
said
bearwarden
let
have
our
guns
ready
and
as
old
deepwaters
would
say
keep
our
weather
eye
open
the
stream
flowed
off
in
a
southeasterly
direction
so
that
by
following
it
they
went
towards
the
volcanoes
it
is
hard
to
realize
said
the
professor
that
those
mountains
must
be
several
hundred
miles
away
for
the
reason
that
they
are
almost
entirely
above
the
horizon
this
apparent
flatness
and
wide
range
of
vision
is
of
course
the
result
of
jupiter
vast
size
with
sufficiently
keen
sight
or
aided
by
a
good
glass
there
is
no
reason
why
one
should
not
see
at
least
five
hundred
miles
with
but
a
slight
elevation
it
is
surprising
said
ayrault
that
in
what
is
evidently
jupiter
carboniferous
period
the
atmosphere
should
be
so
clear
our
idea
has
been
that
at
that
time
on
earth
the
air
was
heavy
and
dense
so
it
was
and
doubtless
is
here
replied
cortlandt
but
you
must
remember
that
both
those
qualities
would
be
given
it
by
gas
which
is
entirely
invisible
and
transparent
no
gas
that
would
be
likely
to
remain
in
the
air
would
interfere
with
sight
water
vapour
is
the
only
thing
that
could
and
though
the
crust
of
this
planet
even
near
the
surface
is
still
hot
the
sun
being
so
distant
the
vapour
would
not
be
raised
much
by
avoiding
low
places
near
hot
springs
we
shall
doubtless
have
very
nearly
as
clear
an
atmosphere
as
on
earth
what
does
surprise
me
is
the
ease
with
which
we
breathe
i
can
account
for
it
only
by
supposing
that
the
carboniferous
period
being
already
well
advanced
most
of
the
carbonic
acid
is
already
locked
up
in
the
forests
or
in
jupiter
how
asked
bearwarden
do
you
account
for
the
red
that
appeared
here
in
lasted
several
years
and
then
gradually
faded
it
was
taken
as
unmistakable
evidence
that
jupiter
atmosphere
was
filled
with
impenetrable
banks
of
cloud
in
fact
you
remember
many
of
the
old
books
said
we
had
probably
never
seen
the
surface
that
has
puzzled
me
very
much
replied
cortlandt
but
i
never
believed
the
explanation
then
given
was
correct
the
carboniferous
period
is
essentially
one
of
great
forest
growth
so
there
would
be
nothing
out
of
the
way
in
supposing
the
spot
notwithstanding
its
length
of
thousand
miles
and
its
breadth
of
eight
thousand
miles
to
have
been
forest
it
occurred
in
what
would
correspond
to
the
temperate
region
on
earth
now
though
the
axis
of
this
planet
is
practically
straight
the
winds
of
course
change
their
direction
and
so
the
temperature
does
vary
from
day
to
day
what
is
more
probable
than
that
owing
perhaps
to
a
prolonged
norther
or
cold
spell
a
long
strip
of
forest
lying
near
the
frost
line
was
brought
a
few
degrees
below
it
so
that
the
leaves
changed
their
colours
as
they
do
on
earth
it
would
it
seems
to
me
be
enough
to
give
the
surface
a
distinct
colour
and
the
fact
that
the
greatest
length
was
east
and
west
or
along
the
lines
of
latitude
so
that
the
whole
of
that
region
might
have
been
exposed
to
the
same
conditions
of
temperature
strengthens
this
hypothesis
the
strongest
objection
is
that
the
spot
is
said
to
have
moved
but
the
motion
five
seconds
was
so
slight
that
it
might
easily
have
been
an
error
in
observation
or
the
first
area
affected
by
the
cold
may
have
been
enlarged
on
one
side
it
seems
to
me
that
the
stability
the
spot
did
have
would
make
the
cloud
theory
impossible
on
earth
and
much
more
so
here
with
the
far
more
rapid
rotation
and
more
violent
winds
it
may
also
have
been
a
cloud
of
smoke
from
a
volcano
in
eruption
such
as
we
saw
on
our
arrival
though
it
is
doubtful
whether
in
that
case
it
would
have
remained
nearly
stationary
while
going
through
its
greatest
intensity
and
fading
which
would
look
as
though
the
turned
leaves
had
fallen
off
and
been
gradually
replaced
by
new
ones
and
in
addition
to
this
the
spot
since
it
was
first
noticed
has
never
entirely
disappeared
which
might
mean
a
volcanic
region
constantly
emitting
smoke
or
that
the
surface
doubtless
from
some
covering
whose
colour
can
change
is
normally
of
a
different
shade
from
the
surrounding
region
in
any
case
we
have
as
yet
seen
nothing
that
would
indicate
a
permanently
clouded
atmosphere
though
they
had
walked
a
considerable
distance
the
water
was
not
much
cooled
and
though
the
stream
descent
was
so
slight
that
on
earth
its
current
would
have
been
very
slow
here
it
rushed
along
like
a
mountain
torrent
the
reason
of
course
being
that
a
given
amount
of
water
on
jupiter
would
depress
a
spring
balance
times
as
much
as
on
the
earth
it
is
strange
said
ayrault
that
notwithstanding
its
great
speed
the
water
remains
so
hot
you
would
think
its
motion
would
cool
it
so
it
does
answered
the
professor
it
of
course
cools
considerably
more
in
a
given
period
as
for
instance
one
minute
than
if
it
were
moving
more
slowly
but
on
account
of
its
speed
it
has
been
exposed
to
the
air
but
a
very
short
time
since
leaving
the
spring
just
before
them
the
stream
now
widened
into
a
narrow
lake
which
they
could
see
was
straight
for
some
distance
the
fact
is
said
bearwarden
this
water
seems
in
such
haste
to
reach
the
ocean
that
it
turns
neither
to
right
nor
to
left
and
does
not
even
seem
to
wish
to
widen
out
as
the
huge
ferns
and
palms
grew
to
the
water
edge
they
concluded
the
best
way
to
traverse
the
lake
would
be
on
a
raft
accordingly
choosing
a
large
overhanging
palm
bearwarden
and
ayrault
fired
each
an
explosive
ball
into
its
trunk
about
eighteen
inches
from
the
ground
one
round
was
enough
to
put
it
in
the
water
each
explosion
removing
several
cubic
feet
of
wood
by
repeating
this
process
on
other
trees
they
soon
had
enough
large
timber
for
buoyancy
so
that
they
had
but
to
superimpose
lighter
and
bind
the
whole
together
with
pliable
branches
and
creepers
to
form
a
substantial
raft
the
doctor
climbed
on
after
which
bearwarden
and
ayrault
cast
off
having
prepared
long
poles
for
navigating
with
a
little
care
they
kept
their
bark
from
catching
on
projecting
roots
and
as
the
stream
continued
to
widen
till
it
was
about
one
hundred
yards
across
their
work
became
easy
carried
along
at
a
speed
of
two
or
three
miles
an
hour
they
now
saw
that
the
water
and
the
banks
they
passed
were
literally
alive
with
reptiles
and
all
sorts
of
amphibious
creatures
while
winged
lizards
sailed
from
every
overhanging
branch
into
the
water
as
they
approached
they
noticed
also
many
birds
similar
to
storks
and
cranes
about
the
size
of
ostriches
standing
on
logs
in
the
water
whose
bills
were
provided
with
teeth
we
might
almost
think
we
were
on
earth
said
ayrault
from
the
looks
of
those
storks
standing
on
one
leg
with
the
other
drawn
up
were
it
not
for
their
size
how
do
you
suppose
they
defend
themselves
asked
bearwarden
from
the
snakes
with
which
the
water
is
filled
i
suspect
they
can
give
a
pretty
good
account
of
themselves
replied
cortlandt
with
those
teeth
besides
with
only
one
leg
exposed
there
is
but
a
very
small
object
for
a
snake
to
strike
at
for
their
number
and
size
i
should
say
their
struggle
for
existence
was
comparatively
mild
doubtless
or
for
that
matter
poisonous
snakes
form
a
great
part
of
their
diet
on
passing
the
bend
in
the
lake
they
noticed
that
the
banks
were
slightly
higher
while
palms
and
rubber
plants
succeeded
the
ferns
in
the
distance
they
now
heard
a
tremendous
crashing
which
grew
louder
as
the
seconds
passed
it
finally
sounded
like
an
earthquake
involuntarily
they
held
their
breath
and
grasped
their
weapons
finally
at
some
distance
in
the
woods
they
saw
a
dark
mass
moving
rapidly
and
approaching
the
river
obliquely
palms
and
went
down
before
it
like
straws
while
its
head
was
continually
among
the
upper
branches
as
the
monster
neared
the
lake
the
water
at
the
edges
quivered
showing
how
its
weight
shook
the
banks
at
each
stride
while
stumps
and
on
which
it
stepped
were
pressed
out
of
sight
in
the
ground
a
general
exodus
of
the
other
inhabitants
from
his
line
of
march
began
the
moccasins
slid
into
the
water
with
a
low
splash
while
the
and
the
moved
off
along
the
ground
when
they
felt
it
tremble
and
a
number
of
night
birds
retreated
into
the
denser
woods
with
loud
cries
at
being
so
rudely
disturbed
the
huge
beast
did
not
stop
till
he
reached
the
bank
where
lie
switched
his
tail
raised
his
proboscis
and
sniffed
the
air
uneasily
his
height
being
fully
thirty
feet
and
his
length
about
fifty
on
seeing
the
raft
and
its
occupants
he
looked
at
them
stupidly
and
threw
back
his
head
he
seems
to
be
turning
up
his
nose
at
us
said
bearwarden
all
the
same
he
will
do
well
for
breakfast
as
the
creature
moved
his
chest
struck
a
huge
overhanging
palm
tearing
it
off
as
though
it
had
been
a
reed
brushing
it
aside
with
his
trunk
he
was
about
to
continue
his
march
when
two
rifle
reports
rang
out
together
rousing
the
echoes
and
a
number
of
birds
that
screeched
loudly
chapter
vi
mastodon
and
wisps
bearwarden
bullet
struck
the
mammoth
in
the
shoulder
while
ayrault
aim
was
farther
back
as
the
balls
exploded
a
of
flesh
and
hide
was
shot
from
each
leaving
two
gaping
holes
instantly
he
rushed
among
the
trees
making
his
course
known
for
some
time
by
his
roars
as
he
turned
bearwarden
fired
again
but
the
hall
flew
over
him
blowing
off
the
top
of
a
tree
now
for
the
chase
said
ayrault
there
would
be
no
excuse
for
losing
him
quickly
pushing
their
raft
to
shore
and
securing
it
to
the
bank
the
three
jumped
off
thanks
to
their
rubber
boots
and
galvanic
outfits
which
automatically
kept
them
charged
they
were
as
spry
as
they
would
have
been
on
earth
the
ground
all
about
them
and
in
a
strip
twelve
feet
wide
where
the
mammoth
had
gone
was
torn
up
and
the
vegetation
trodden
down
following
this
trail
they
struck
back
into
the
woods
where
in
places
the
gloom
cast
by
the
thick
foliage
was
so
dense
that
there
was
a
mere
twilight
startling
as
they
went
numbers
of
birds
of
grey
and
sombre
plumage
whose
necks
and
heads
and
the
sounds
they
uttered
were
so
reptilian
that
the
three
terrestrials
believed
they
must
also
possess
poison
fangs
the
most
highly
developed
things
we
have
seen
here
said
bearwarden
are
the
flowers
and
fireflies
most
of
the
birds
and
amphibians
being
simply
loathsome
as
they
proceeded
they
found
tracks
of
blood
which
were
rapidly
attracting
swarms
of
the
reptile
birds
and
snakes
which
however
as
a
rule
fled
at
their
approach
i
wonder
what
can
have
caused
that
mammoth
to
move
so
fast
and
to
have
seemed
so
ill
at
ease
said
the
doctor
his
motive
certainly
was
not
thirst
for
he
did
not
approach
the
water
in
a
direct
line
neither
did
he
drink
on
reaching
it
one
would
think
nothing
short
of
an
earthquake
or
a
could
trouble
him
there
can
be
no
here
said
ayrault
for
the
country
is
too
flat
and
after
yesterday
eruptions
added
bearwarden
it
would
seem
as
though
the
volcanoes
could
have
scarcely
enough
steam
left
to
make
trouble
the
continuing
to
become
fresher
showed
them
they
were
nearing
the
game
when
suddenly
the
trail
took
a
sharp
turn
to
the
right
even
returning
towards
the
lake
a
little
farther
it
took
another
sharp
turn
then
followed
a
series
of
doublings
while
still
farther
the
ground
was
completely
denuded
of
trees
its
and
trampled
condition
and
the
enormous
amount
of
still
warm
blood
showing
how
terrific
a
battle
had
just
taken
place
while
they
looked
about
they
saw
what
appeared
to
be
the
trunk
of
a
tree
about
four
feet
in
diameter
and
six
feet
long
with
a
slight
crook
on
coming
closer
they
recognized
in
it
one
of
the
forefeet
of
the
mammoth
cut
as
cleanly
as
though
with
a
knife
from
the
leg
just
above
the
ankle
and
still
warm
a
little
farther
they
found
the
huge
trunk
cut
to
slivers
and
just
beyond
the
body
of
the
unfortunate
beast
with
three
of
its
feet
gone
and
the
thick
hide
cut
and
slashed
like
so
much
paper
it
still
breathed
and
ayrault
who
had
a
tender
heart
sent
an
explosive
ball
into
its
skull
which
ended
its
suffering
the
three
hunters
then
surveyed
the
scene
the
largest
and
most
powerful
beast
they
had
believed
could
exist
lay
before
them
dead
not
from
the
bite
of
a
snake
or
any
other
poison
but
from
mechanical
injuries
of
which
those
they
had
inflicted
formed
but
a
very
small
part
and
literally
cut
to
pieces
i
am
curious
to
see
the
animal
said
cortlandt
capable
of
doing
this
though
nothing
short
of
dynamite
bombs
would
protect
us
from
him
as
he
has
not
stopped
to
eat
his
victim
said
bearwarden
it
is
fair
to
suppose
he
is
not
carnivorous
and
so
must
have
had
some
other
motive
than
hunger
in
making
the
attack
unless
we
can
suppose
that
our
approach
frightened
him
away
which
with
such
power
as
he
must
possess
seems
unlikely
let
us
see
he
continued
parts
of
two
legs
remain
unaccounted
for
perhaps
on
account
of
their
shape
he
has
been
able
the
more
easily
to
carry
or
roll
them
off
for
we
know
that
elephant
foot
makes
a
capital
dish
from
the
way
you
talk
said
cortlandt
one
would
suppose
you
attributed
this
to
men
the
goliath
we
picture
to
ourselves
would
be
a
child
compared
to
the
man
that
could
cut
through
these
legs
though
the
necessity
of
believing
him
to
have
merely
great
size
does
not
disprove
his
existence
here
i
think
it
probable
we
shall
find
this
is
the
work
of
some
animal
with
incisors
of
such
power
as
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
conceive
of
there
is
no
indication
here
of
teeth
said
bearwarden
each
foot
being
taken
off
with
a
clean
cut
besides
we
are
coming
to
believe
that
man
existed
on
earth
during
the
greater
part
if
not
the
whole
of
our
carboniferous
period
we
must
reserve
our
decision
pending
further
evidence
said
cortlandt
i
vote
we
take
the
heart
said
ayrault
and
cook
it
since
otherwise
the
mammoth
will
be
devoured
before
our
eyes
while
bearwarden
and
ayrault
delved
for
this
cortlandt
with
some
difficulty
parted
the
mammoth
lips
and
examined
the
teeth
from
the
conical
projections
on
the
molars
said
he
this
should
be
classed
rather
as
a
mastodon
than
as
a
mammoth
when
the
huge
heart
was
secured
bearwarden
arranged
slices
on
sharpened
sticks
while
ayrault
set
about
starting
a
fire
he
had
to
use
cortlandt
gun
to
clear
the
dry
wood
of
snakes
which
attracted
doubtless
by
the
dead
mastodon
came
in
such
numbers
that
they
covered
the
ground
while
huge
pterodactyls
more
than
the
reptiles
hovered
about
the
opening
above
arranging
a
double
line
of
electric
wires
in
a
circle
about
the
mastodon
and
themselves
they
sat
down
and
did
justice
to
the
meal
with
appetites
that
might
have
dismayed
the
waiting
throng
whenever
a
snake
head
came
in
contact
with
one
wire
while
his
tail
touched
the
other
he
gave
a
spasmodic
leap
and
fell
back
dead
if
he
happened
to
fall
across
the
wires
lie
immediately
began
to
sizzle
a
cloud
of
smoke
arose
and
lie
was
reduced
to
ashes
any
time
that
we
are
short
of
mastodon
or
other
good
game
said
ayrault
we
need
not
hunger
if
we
are
not
above
grilled
snake
all
laughed
at
this
and
bearwarden
drawing
a
from
his
pocket
passed
it
to
his
friends
when
we
rig
our
he
continued
and
have
fresh
fish
for
dinner
an
entree
of
rattlesnake
roast
mastodon
for
the
piece
de
resistance
and
begin
the
whole
with
turtle
soup
and
clams
of
which
there
must
be
plenty
on
the
ocean
beach
we
shall
want
to
stay
here
the
rest
of
our
lives
i
suspect
we
shall
have
to
replied
ayrault
for
we
shall
become
so
like
thanksgiving
turkeys
that
the
callisto
door
will
be
too
small
for
us
while
they
sat
and
talked
the
flowers
and
plants
about
them
softly
began
their
song
and
as
a
visual
accompaniment
the
they
had
not
before
noticed
twinkled
through
the
forest
my
goodness
exclaimed
cortlandt
how
time
goes
here
we
started
to
get
breakfast
and
now
it
growing
dark
hastily
cutting
some
thick
but
tender
slices
from
the
mastodon
and
impaling
them
with
the
remains
of
the
heart
on
a
sharpened
stake
they
took
up
the
wires
and
the
battery
that
had
been
supplying
the
current
and
retraced
their
steps
by
the
way
they
had
come
their
cowhide
boots
protected
them
from
all
but
the
largest
snakes
and
as
these
were
for
the
most
part
already
enjoying
their
gorge
they
trampled
with
impunity
on
those
that
remained
in
their
path
when
they
had
covered
about
half
the
distance
to
the
raft
a
huge
which
they
had
mistaken
for
a
branch
fell
upon
cortlandt
pinioning
his
arms
and
bearing
him
to
the
ground
dropping
their
loads
bearwarden
and
ayrault
threw
themselves
upon
the
monster
with
their
with
such
vim
that
in
a
few
seconds
it
beat
a
hasty
retreat
leaving
as
it
did
so
a
wake
of
phosphorescent
light
are
you
hurt
asked
bearwarden
helping
him
up
not
in
the
least
replied
cortlandt
what
surprises
me
is
that
i
am
not
the
weight
of
that
would
be
very
great
on
earth
and
here
i
should
think
it
would
be
simply
crushing
groping
their
way
through
the
rapidly
growing
darkness
they
reached
the
raft
without
further
adventure
and
once
on
the
lake
had
plenty
of
light
two
moons
one
at
three
quarters
and
the
other
full
shone
brightly
while
the
water
was
alive
with
gymnotuses
and
other
luminous
creatures
sitting
and
living
upon
the
they
looked
up
at
the
sky
the
great
bear
and
the
north
star
had
exactly
the
same
relation
to
each
other
as
when
seen
from
the
earth
while
the
other
constellations
and
the
milky
way
looked
identically
as
when
they
had
so
often
gazed
at
them
before
and
some
idea
of
the
immensity
of
space
was
conveyed
to
them
here
was
no
change
though
they
had
travelled
three
hundred
and
eighty
million
miles
there
was
no
more
perceptible
difference
than
if
they
had
not
moved
a
foot
perhaps
they
thought
to
the
telescopes
if
there
are
any
among
the
stars
the
sun
was
seen
to
be
accompanied
by
two
small
dark
companions
for
jupiter
and
saturn
might
be
visible
or
perhaps
it
seemed
merely
as
a
slightly
variable
star
in
years
when
were
numerous
or
as
the
larger
planets
in
their
revolutions
occasionally
intercepted
a
part
of
its
light
as
they
floated
along
they
noticed
a
number
of
what
they
took
to
be
several
of
these
great
globules
of
pale
flame
hovered
about
them
in
the
air
near
the
surface
of
the
water
and
anon
they
rose
till
they
hung
above
the
trees
apparently
having
no
forward
or
horizontal
motion
except
when
taken
by
the
gentle
breeze
merely
sinking
and
rising
how
pretty
they
are
said
cortlandt
as
they
watched
them
for
bodies
consisting
of
marsh
gas
they
hold
together
wonderfully
presently
one
alighted
on
the
water
near
them
it
was
considerably
brighter
than
any
and
somewhat
larger
than
an
arc
lamp
being
nearly
three
feet
in
diameter
it
did
not
emit
much
light
but
would
itself
have
been
visible
from
a
considerable
distance
cortlandt
tried
to
touch
it
with
a
but
could
not
reach
far
enough
presently
a
large
fish
approached
it
swimming
near
the
surface
of
the
water
when
it
was
close
to
the
or
whatever
it
was
there
was
a
splash
the
fish
turned
up
its
white
under
side
and
the
breeze
being
away
from
the
raft
the
and
its
victim
slowly
floated
off
together
there
were
frequently
a
dozen
of
these
great
globules
in
sight
at
once
rising
and
descending
the
observers
noticing
one
peculiarity
that
their
brightness
increased
as
they
rose
and
decreased
as
they
sank
about
two
and
a
half
hours
after
sunset
or
midnight
according
to
jupiter
time
they
fell
asleep
but
about
an
hour
later
cortlandt
was
awakened
by
a
weight
on
his
chest
starting
up
he
perceived
a
huge
bat
with
its
head
but
a
few
inches
from
his
its
outstretched
wings
were
about
eight
feet
across
and
it
fastened
its
sharp
claws
upon
him
seizing
it
by
the
throat
he
struggled
violently
his
companions
awakened
by
the
noise
quickly
came
to
his
rescue
grasping
him
just
as
he
was
in
danger
of
being
dragged
off
the
raft
and
in
another
moment
knife
had
entered
the
creature
spine
this
evidently
belongs
to
the
species
said
cortlandt
i
seem
to
be
the
target
for
all
these
beasts
and
henceforth
shall
keep
my
eyes
open
at
night
as
day
would
break
in
but
little
over
an
hour
they
decided
to
remain
awake
and
they
pushed
the
dead
bat
overboard
where
it
was
soon
devoured
by
fishes
a
chill
had
come
upon
the
air
and
the
incessant
noise
of
the
forms
of
life
about
them
had
in
a
measure
ceased
cortlandt
passed
around
a
box
of
quinine
as
a
preventive
against
malaria
and
again
they
lay
back
and
looked
at
the
stars
the
most
splendid
sight
in
their
sky
now
was
saturn
at
the
comparatively
short
distance
this
great
planet
was
from
them
it
cast
a
distinct
shadow
its
vast
rings
making
it
appear
twice
its
real
size
with
the
first
glimmer
of
dawn
the
descended
to
the
surface
of
the
water
and
disappeared
within
it
their
lights
going
out
with
a
suddenness
to
which
the
explorers
were
becoming
accustomed
the
sun
burst
upon
them
rising
as
perpendicularly
as
at
the
earth
equator
and
more
than
twice
as
fast
having
first
tinged
the
sky
with
the
most
brilliant
hues
the
stream
had
left
the
forest
and
swamp
and
was
now
flowing
through
open
country
between
high
banks
pushing
the
raft
ashore
they
stepped
off
on
the
sand
and
warming
up
the
remains
of
the
mastodon
heart
ate
a
substantial
breakfast
while
washing
their
knives
in
the
stream
preparatory
to
leaving
it
for
they
wished
to
return
to
the
callisto
by
completing
the
circle
they
had
begun
they
noticed
a
huge
flat
in
shallow
water
it
was
so
transparent
that
they
could
see
the
sandy
bottom
through
it
as
it
seemed
to
be
asleep
bearwarden
stirred
up
the
water
around
it
and
poked
it
with
a
stick
the
fish
first
drew
itself
together
till
it
touched
the
surface
of
the
water
being
nearly
round
then
it
slowly
left
the
stream
and
rose
till
it
was
wholly
in
the
air
and
notwithstanding
the
sunlight
it
emitted
a
faint
glow
ah
exclaimed
bearwarden
here
we
have
one
of
our
let
us
see
what
it
is
going
to
do
it
is
incomprehensible
to
me
said
cortlandt
how
it
maintains
itself
for
it
has
neither
wings
nor
visible
means
of
support
yet
as
it
was
able
to
immerse
itself
in
the
stream
thereby
displacing
a
volume
of
liquid
equivalent
to
its
bulk
it
must
be
at
least
as
heavy
as
water
the
remained
poised
in
the
air
until
directly
above
them
when
it
began
to
descend
stand
from
under
cried
bearwarden
stepping
back
i
for
one
should
not
care
to
be
touched
the
great
soft
mass
came
directly
over
the
spot
on
which
they
had
been
standing
and
stopped
its
descent
about
three
feet
from
the
ground
parallel
to
which
it
was
slowly
carried
by
the
wind
a
few
yards
off
in
the
direction
in
which
it
was
moving
lay
a
long
black
snake
asleep
on
the
sand
when
directly
over
its
victim
the
jelly
globule
again
sank
till
it
touched
the
middle
of
the
reptile
back
the
serpent
immediately
coiled
itself
in
a
knot
but
was
already
dead
the
jellyfish
did
not
swallow
but
completely
surrounded
its
prey
and
again
rose
in
the
air
with
the
snake
black
body
clearly
visible
within
it
our
is
prettier
by
night
than
by
day
said
bearwarden
i
suggest
that
we
investigate
this
further
how
asked
cortlandt
by
destroying
its
life
replied
bearwarden
give
it
one
barrel
from
your
gun
doctor
and
see
if
it
can
then
defy
gravitation
accordingly
cortlandt
took
careful
aim
at
the
object
about
away
and
fired
the
main
portion
of
the
jellyfish
with
the
snake
still
in
its
embrace
sailed
away
but
many
pounds
of
jelly
fell
to
the
ground
most
of
this
remained
where
it
had
fallen
but
a
few
of
the
larger
pieces
showed
a
faint
luminosity
and
rose
again
you
can
not
kill
that
which
is
simply
a
mass
of
protoplasm
said
cortlandt
doubtless
each
of
those
pieces
will
form
a
new
organism
this
proves
that
there
are
ramifications
and
developments
of
life
which
we
never
dreamed
of
chapter
vii
an
unseen
hunter
they
calculated
that
they
had
come
ten
or
twelve
miles
from
the
place
at
which
they
built
the
raft
while
the
damp
salt
breeze
blowing
from
the
south
showed
them
they
were
near
the
ocean
concluding
that
large
bodies
of
water
must
be
very
much
alike
on
all
planets
they
decided
to
make
for
a
range
of
hills
due
north
and
a
few
miles
off
and
to
complete
the
circuit
of
the
square
in
returning
to
the
callisto
the
soft
wet
sand
was
covered
with
huge
and
curious
tracks
doubtless
made
by
creatures
that
had
come
to
the
stream
during
the
night
to
drink
and
they
noticed
with
satisfaction
as
they
set
out
that
the
fresher
ones
led
off
in
the
direction
in
which
they
were
going
for
practice
they
blew
off
the
heads
of
the
as
they
hung
from
the
trees
and
of
the
other
huge
snakes
that
moved
along
the
ground
with
explosive
bullets
in
every
thicket
through
which
they
passed
knowing
that
the
game
never
having
been
shot
at
would
not
take
fright
at
the
noise
sometimes
they
came
upon
great
masses
of
snakes
intertwined
and
coiled
like
worms
in
these
cases
cortlandt
brought
his
gun
into
play
raking
them
with
to
his
heart
content
as
the
function
of
these
reptiles
he
explained
is
to
form
a
soil
on
which
higher
life
may
grow
we
may
as
well
help
along
their
metamorphosis
by
artificial
means
they
were
impressed
by
the
tremendous
reports
of
their
firearms
which
they
perceived
at
once
resulted
from
the
great
density
of
the
jovian
atmosphere
and
this
was
also
a
considerable
aid
to
them
in
making
muscular
exertion
for
it
had
just
the
reverse
effect
of
rarefied
mountain
air
and
they
seldom
had
to
expand
their
lungs
fully
in
order
to
breathe
the
ground
continued
to
be
marked
with
very
large
footprints
often
the
impressions
were
those
of
a
biped
like
some
huge
bird
except
that
occasionally
the
creature
had
put
down
one
or
both
forefeet
and
a
thick
tail
had
evidently
dragged
nearly
all
the
time
it
walked
erect
presently
coming
to
something
they
had
taken
for
a
large
flat
rock
they
were
surprised
to
see
it
move
it
was
about
twelve
feet
wide
by
eighteen
feet
long
while
its
shell
seemed
at
least
a
foot
thick
and
it
was
of
course
the
largest
turtle
they
had
ever
seen
people
could
dine
at
a
table
of
this
size
with
ease
said
bearwarden
while
it
would
make
soup
for
a
regiment
i
wonder
if
it
belongs
to
the
snapping
or
species
at
this
juncture
the
monster
again
moved
as
it
is
heading
in
our
direction
resumed
bearwarden
i
vote
we
strike
for
a
free
pass
and
taking
a
run
he
sprang
with
his
spiked
boots
upon
the
turtle
shell
and
clambered
upon
the
flat
top
which
was
about
six
feet
from
the
ground
he
was
quickly
followed
by
ayrault
who
was
not
much
ahead
of
cortlandt
for
notwithstanding
his
fifty
years
the
professor
was
very
spry
the
tortoise
was
almost
the
exact
counterpart
of
the
glyptodon
asper
that
formerly
existed
on
earth
and
shambled
along
at
a
jerky
gait
about
half
as
fast
again
as
they
could
walk
and
while
it
continued
to
go
in
their
direction
they
were
greatly
pleased
they
soon
found
that
by
dropping
the
butts
of
their
rifles
sharply
and
simultaneously
on
either
side
just
back
of
the
head
they
could
direct
their
course
by
making
their
steed
swerve
away
from
the
stamping
it
is
strange
said
ayrault
that
with
the
exception
of
the
mastodon
and
this
tortoise
we
have
seen
none
of
the
monsters
that
seem
to
appear
at
the
close
of
carboniferous
periods
although
the
ground
is
covered
with
their
tracks
probably
we
did
not
reach
the
grounds
at
the
right
time
of
day
replied
bearwarden
the
large
game
doubtless
stays
in
the
woods
and
jungles
till
night
i
fancy
said
cortlandt
we
shall
find
representatives
of
all
the
species
that
once
lived
upon
the
earth
in
the
case
of
the
singing
flowers
and
the
we
have
in
addition
seen
developments
the
existence
of
which
no
scientist
has
ever
before
even
suspected
occasionally
the
tortoise
stopped
whereupon
they
poked
it
from
behind
with
their
knives
it
was
a
brute
and
had
a
huge
horny
beak
with
which
it
bit
off
young
trees
that
stood
in
its
way
as
though
they
had
been
blades
of
grass
they
were
passing
through
a
valley
about
half
a
mile
wide
bordered
on
each
side
by
woods
when
bearwarden
suddenly
exclaimed
here
we
have
it
and
looking
forward
they
unexpectedly
saw
a
head
rise
and
remain
poised
about
fifteen
feet
from
the
ground
it
was
a
dinosaur
and
belonged
to
the
scaled
or
armoured
species
in
a
few
moments
another
head
appeared
and
towered
several
feet
above
the
first
the
head
was
obviously
reptilian
but
had
a
beak
similar
to
that
of
their
tortoise
the
hind
legs
were
developed
like
those
of
a
kangaroo
while
the
small
rudimentary
forepaws
which
could
be
used
as
hands
or
for
going
now
hung
down
the
strong
thick
tail
was
evidently
of
great
use
to
them
when
standing
erect
by
forming
a
sort
of
tripod
how
i
wish
we
could
take
a
pair
of
those
creatures
with
us
when
we
return
to
the
earth
said
cortlandt
they
would
be
trump
cards
replied
bearwarden
in
a
zoological
garden
or
a
dime
museum
and
would
take
the
wind
out
of
the
sails
of
all
the
other
freaks
as
they
lay
flat
on
the
turtle
back
the
monsters
gazed
at
them
unconcernedly
munching
the
fruit
so
loudly
that
they
could
be
heard
a
long
distance
having
nothing
to
fear
from
a
tortoise
resumed
cortlandt
they
may
allow
us
to
stalk
them
we
are
in
their
eyes
like
hippocentaurs
except
that
we
are
part
of
a
tortoise
instead
of
part
of
a
horse
or
else
they
take
us
for
a
parasite
or
fibrous
growth
on
the
shell
they
would
not
have
much
to
fear
from
us
as
we
really
are
replied
bearwarden
were
it
not
for
our
explosive
bullets
i
am
surprised
said
ayrault
that
graminivorous
animals
should
be
so
heavily
armed
as
these
since
there
can
be
no
great
struggle
in
obtaining
their
food
from
the
looks
of
their
jaws
replied
cortlandt
i
should
say
they
are
omnivorous
and
would
doubtless
prefer
meat
to
what
they
are
eating
now
something
seems
to
have
gone
wrong
with
the
animal
creation
hereabouts
their
clanked
along
like
a
badly
rusted
machine
approaching
the
dinosaurs
obliquely
when
only
about
fifty
yards
intervened
as
the
hunters
were
preparing
to
aim
their
attention
was
diverted
by
a
tremendous
commotion
in
the
woods
on
their
left
and
somewhat
ahead
with
the
crunching
of
dead
branches
and
swaying
of
the
trees
a
drove
of
monsters
made
a
hasty
exit
and
sped
across
the
open
valley
some
showed
only
the
tops
of
their
backs
above
the
long
grass
while
others
shambled
and
leaped
with
their
heads
nearly
thirty
feet
above
the
ground
the
dinosaurs
instantly
dropped
on
and
joined
in
the
flight
though
at
about
intervals
they
rose
on
their
hind
legs
and
for
a
few
seconds
ran
erect
the
drove
passed
about
half
a
mile
before
the
travellers
and
made
straight
for
the
woods
opposite
but
hardly
had
the
monsters
been
out
of
sight
two
minutes
when
they
reappeared
even
more
precipitately
than
before
and
fled
up
the
valley
in
the
same
direction
as
the
tortoise
the
animals
here
said
bearwarden
behave
as
though
they
were
going
to
catch
a
train
only
our
friend
beneath
us
seems
superior
to
haste
i
would
give
a
good
deal
to
know
said
cortlandt
what
is
pursuing
those
giants
and
whether
it
is
identical
or
similar
to
the
mutilator
of
the
mastodon
nothing
but
abject
terror
could
make
them
run
like
that
i
have
a
idea
said
bearwarden
that
a
hunt
is
going
on
with
no
doubt
two
parties
one
in
the
woods
on
either
side
and
that
the
hunters
may
be
on
a
scale
commensurate
with
that
of
their
victims
if
the
excitement
is
caused
by
men
replied
cortlandt
our
exploration
may
turn
out
to
be
a
far
more
difficult
undertaking
than
we
anticipated
but
why
if
there
are
men
in
those
woods
do
they
not
show
themselves
for
they
could
certainly
keep
pace
with
the
game
more
easily
in
the
open
than
among
the
trees
because
replied
bearwarden
the
men
in
the
woods
are
doubtless
the
beaters
whose
duty
it
is
to
drive
the
game
into
and
up
the
valley
at
the
end
of
which
the
killing
will
be
done
we
may
have
a
chance
to
see
it
said
ayrault
or
to
take
a
hand
for
we
are
travelling
straight
in
that
direction
and
shall
be
able
to
give
a
good
account
ourselves
if
our
rights
are
challenged
why
asked
cortlandt
if
the
hunting
parties
that
have
been
in
our
vicinity
were
only
beaters
should
they
have
mutilated
the
mastodon
in
such
it
way
that
he
could
not
walk
and
how
were
they
able
to
take
themselves
off
so
quickly
for
man
in
his
natural
state
has
never
been
a
fast
mover
i
repeat
it
will
upset
my
theories
if
we
find
men
it
was
obvious
to
them
that
tortoises
were
not
much
troubled
by
the
apparently
general
foe
for
the
specimen
in
which
they
were
just
then
interested
continued
his
course
entirely
unconcerned
soon
however
he
seemed
to
feel
fatigue
for
he
drew
his
feet
and
head
within
his
shell
which
he
tightly
closed
and
after
that
no
poking
or
prodding
had
the
desired
effect
i
suspect
we
must
depend
on
shank
mares
for
a
time
said
bearwarden
cheerfully
as
they
scrambled
down
we
can
now
see
said
cortlandt
why
our
friend
was
so
unconcerned
since
he
has
but
to
draw
himself
within
himself
to
become
invulnerable
to
anything
short
of
a
stroke
of
lightning
for
no
bird
could
have
power
enough
to
raise
and
drop
him
from
a
great
height
upon
rocks
as
the
eagles
do
on
earth
i
suspect
if
anxious
for
turtle
soup
said
bearwarden
we
must
attach
a
lightning
rod
and
wait
for
a
thunderstorm
to
electrocute
him
chapter
viii
sportsmen
reveries
feeling
grateful
to
the
huge
tortoise
for
the
good
service
he
had
rendered
they
shot
a
number
of
the
great
snakes
that
were
gliding
about
on
the
ground
and
placed
them
where
he
would
find
them
on
awaiting
they
then
picked
their
way
carefully
towards
stretches
on
which
the
grass
was
shortest
when
they
had
gone
about
two
miles
and
had
already
reached
higher
ground
they
came
to
a
ridge
of
rock
running
at
right
angles
to
their
course
this
they
climbed
and
on
looking
over
the
edge
of
the
crest
beheld
a
sight
that
made
their
hearts
stand
still
a
monster
somewhat
resembling
an
alligator
except
that
the
back
was
arched
was
waddling
about
perhaps
five
yards
from
them
it
was
sixty
feet
long
and
to
the
top
of
its
scales
was
at
least
feet
high
it
was
constantly
moving
and
the
travellers
noticed
with
some
dismay
that
its
motion
was
far
more
rapid
than
they
would
have
supposed
it
could
be
it
is
also
a
dinosaur
said
the
professor
watching
it
sharply
and
very
closely
resembles
the
stegosaurus
ungulatus
restored
in
the
museums
the
question
is
what
shall
we
do
with
the
living
specimen
now
that
we
have
it
our
chairman
said
ayrault
must
find
a
way
to
kill
it
so
that
we
may
examine
it
closely
the
trouble
is
said
bearwarden
our
bullets
will
explode
before
they
penetrate
the
scales
in
the
absence
of
any
way
of
making
a
passage
for
an
explosive
ball
by
means
of
a
solid
one
we
must
strike
a
vital
spot
his
scales
being
no
harder
than
the
trunk
of
a
tree
we
can
wound
him
terribly
by
touching
him
anywhere
but
there
is
no
object
in
doing
this
unless
we
can
kill
him
especially
as
there
is
no
deep
stream
such
as
would
have
delayed
the
mastodon
in
reaching
us
to
protect
us
here
we
must
spread
out
so
as
to
divert
his
attention
from
one
to
another
after
some
consultation
it
was
decided
that
cortlandt
who
had
only
a
should
remain
where
they
were
while
bearwarden
and
ayrault
moved
some
distance
to
the
right
and
left
at
a
signal
from
cortlandt
who
was
to
attract
the
attention
the
wings
were
to
advance
simultaneously
these
arrangements
they
carried
out
to
the
letter
when
bearwarden
and
ayrault
had
gone
about
yards
on
either
side
the
doctor
imitated
the
peculiar
grunting
sound
of
an
alligator
at
which
the
colossal
monster
turned
and
faced
him
while
bearwarden
and
ayrault
moved
to
the
attack
the
plan
of
this
was
good
for
with
his
attention
fixed
on
three
objects
the
dinosaur
seemed
confused
and
though
bearwarden
and
ayrault
had
good
angles
from
which
to
shoot
there
was
no
possibility
of
their
hitting
each
other
they
therefore
advanced
steadily
with
their
rifles
half
up
though
their
own
danger
increased
with
each
step
in
the
event
of
their
missing
the
chance
of
their
shooting
wild
decreased
the
idea
being
to
reach
the
brain
through
the
eye
cortlandt
part
had
also
its
risks
for
being
entirely
defenceless
with
his
against
the
large
creature
whose
attention
it
was
his
duty
to
attract
he
staked
all
on
the
marksmanship
of
his
friends
not
considering
this
however
he
stood
his
ground
having
the
on
his
winchester
magazine
shoved
up
and
ready
to
make
a
noisy
diversion
if
necessary
in
behalf
of
either
wing
having
aroused
the
curiosity
cortlandt
sprang
up
waving
his
arms
and
his
gun
the
dinosaur
lowered
his
head
as
if
to
charge
thereby
bringing
it
to
a
level
with
the
rifles
either
of
which
could
have
given
it
the
fatal
shot
but
as
their
fingers
pressed
the
triggers
the
reptile
soared
up
thirty
feet
in
the
air
ayrault
pulled
for
his
first
sight
shooting
through
the
lower
jaw
and
shivering
that
member
while
bearwarden
changed
his
aim
and
sighted
straight
for
the
heart
in
an
instant
the
monster
was
down
again
just
missing
ayrault
head
as
he
stepped
back
and
bearwarden
rifle
poured
a
stream
of
explosive
balls
against
its
side
rending
and
blowing
away
the
heavy
scales
having
drawn
the
attention
to
himself
he
retreated
while
ayrault
renewed
the
attack
cortlandt
seeing
that
the
original
plan
had
miscarried
poured
showers
of
small
shot
against
the
huge
beast
face
finally
one
of
ayrault
balls
exploded
in
the
brain
and
all
was
over
we
have
killed
it
at
last
said
bearwarden
but
the
first
attack
though
artistic
had
not
the
brilliant
results
we
expected
these
creatures
mode
of
fighting
is
doubtless
somewhat
similar
to
that
of
the
kangaroo
which
it
is
said
puts
its
forepaws
gently
almost
lovingly
on
a
man
shoulders
and
then
disembowels
him
by
the
rapid
movement
of
a
hind
leg
but
we
shall
get
used
to
their
method
and
can
do
better
next
time
they
then
reloaded
their
weapons
and
while
cortlandt
examined
their
victim
from
a
naturalist
point
of
view
bearwarden
and
ayrault
secured
the
heart
which
they
thought
would
be
the
most
edible
part
the
operation
being
rendered
possible
by
the
amount
of
armour
the
explosive
balls
had
stripped
off
said
bearwarden
we
must
make
it
a
point
to
get
some
birds
for
i
can
roast
broil
or
fricassee
them
to
a
turn
life
is
too
short
to
live
on
this
meat
in
such
a
sportsman
paradise
in
any
case
there
can
be
no
end
of
mastodons
mammoths
woolly
rhinoceroses
moa
birds
and
all
such
shooting
as
the
sun
was
already
near
the
horizon
they
chose
a
dry
sandy
place
to
secure
as
much
immunity
as
possible
from
nocturnal
visits
and
after
procuring
a
supply
of
water
from
a
pool
proceeded
to
arrange
their
camp
for
the
night
they
first
laid
out
the
wires
setting
them
while
the
sun
still
shone
next
they
built
a
fire
and
prepared
their
evening
meal
while
they
ate
it
twilight
became
night
and
the
twinkling
in
legions
in
the
neighbouring
valley
seemed
like
the
lamps
of
a
great
city
their
lights
said
bearwarden
pointing
to
them
are
not
as
fine
as
the
wisps
were
last
night
but
they
are
not
so
dangerous
no
gymnotus
or
electric
eel
that
i
have
ever
seen
compared
with
them
and
i
am
convinced
that
any
one
of
us
they
might
have
touched
would
have
been
in
kingdom
come
the
balmy
air
soothed
the
travellers
brows
as
they
reclined
against
mounds
of
sand
while
the
flowers
in
the
valley
sent
up
their
dying
notes
one
by
one
the
moons
arose
till
four
among
them
the
lilliputian
discovered
by
barnard
in
were
in
the
sky
flooding
the
landscape
with
their
silvery
light
and
something
in
the
surroundings
touched
a
sympathetic
cord
in
the
men
oh
that
i
were
young
again
said
cortlandt
and
had
life
before
me
i
should
like
to
remain
here
and
grow
up
with
this
planet
in
which
we
already
perceive
the
next
new
world
the
beauties
of
earth
are
barren
compared
with
the
scenes
we
have
here
you
remember
replied
bearwarden
how
cicero
defends
old
age
in
his
de
senectute
and
shows
that
while
it
has
almost
everything
that
youth
has
it
has
also
a
sense
of
calm
and
many
things
besides
yes
answered
cortlandt
but
while
plausible
it
does
not
convince
the
pleasures
of
age
are
largely
negative
the
old
being
happy
when
free
from
pain
since
the
highest
joy
of
life
said
ayrault
is
coming
to
know
our
creator
i
should
say
the
old
being
further
advanced
would
be
the
happier
of
the
two
i
should
never
regard
this
material
life
as
greatly
to
be
prized
for
itself
you
remember
the
old
song
youth
when
we
come
to
consider
the
pain
the
toil
and
the
strife
the
happiest
man
of
all
is
the
one
who
has
finished
his
life
i
suspect
continued
ayrault
that
the
man
who
reaches
even
the
lowest
plane
in
paradise
will
find
far
more
beautiful
visions
than
any
we
have
here
as
they
had
but
little
rest
the
night
before
they
were
all
tired
the
warm
breeze
swayed
the
long
dry
grass
causing
it
to
give
out
a
soft
rustle
all
birds
except
the
flitting
bats
were
asleep
among
the
tall
ferns
or
on
the
great
trees
that
spread
their
branches
towards
heaven
there
was
nothing
to
recall
a
picture
of
the
huge
monsters
they
had
seen
that
day
or
of
the
still
more
to
be
dreaded
terror
these
had
borne
witness
to
thus
night
closes
the
activities
of
the
day
and
in
its
serene
grandeur
the
soul
has
time
to
think
while
they
thought
however
drowsiness
overcame
them
and
in
a
little
while
all
were
asleep
the
double
line
of
encircled
them
like
a
silent
guard
while
the
methodical
ticking
of
the
that
was
to
wake
them
at
the
approach
of
danger
and
register
the
hour
of
interruption
formed
a
curious
contrast
to
the
irregular
cries
of
the
in
the
distance
time
and
again
some
huge
iguanodon
or
a
hipsohopus
would
pass
shaking
the
ground
with
its
tread
but
so
implicit
was
the
travellers
trust
in
the
vigilance
of
their
mechanical
and
tireless
watch
that
they
slept
on
as
calmly
and
unconcernedly
as
though
they
had
been
in
their
beds
at
home
while
the
tick
was
as
constant
and
regular
as
a
march
the
wires
of
course
did
not
protect
them
from
creatures
having
wings
and
they
ran
some
risk
of
a
visitation
from
the
bats
the
volcanoes
occasionally
sent
up
sheets
of
flame
which
in
the
distance
were
like
summer
lightning
the
torrents
of
lava
and
crashes
that
had
sounded
so
thunderous
when
near
were
now
like
the
murmur
of
the
ocean
ebb
tide
lulling
the
terrestrials
to
deeper
sleep
the
pale
moons
were
at
intervals
momentarily
obscured
by
the
rushing
clouds
in
the
upper
air
only
to
reappear
soon
afterwards
as
serene
as
before
all
nature
seemed
at
rest
shortly
before
dawn
there
was
an
unusually
heavy
step
a
moment
later
the
batteries
poured
forth
their
current
and
the
clang
of
the
made
the
still
night
ring
in
an
instant
the
three
men
were
awake
each
resting
on
one
knee
with
their
backs
towards
the
centre
and
their
polished
barrels
raised
it
was
not
long
before
they
perceived
the
intruder
by
the
moonlight
a
huge
monster
of
the
triceratops
prorsus
species
had
entered
the
camp
it
was
shaped
something
like
an
elephant
but
had
ten
or
twelve
times
the
bulk
being
over
forty
feet
in
length
not
including
the
long
thick
tail
the
head
carried
two
huge
horns
on
the
forehead
and
one
on
the
nose
a
plague
on
my
said
cortlandt
had
i
known
how
much
of
this
kind
of
game
we
should
see
i
too
should
have
brought
a
rifle
the
monster
was
entangled
in
the
wires
and
in
another
second
would
have
stepped
on
the
batteries
that
were
still
causing
the
bell
to
ring
aim
for
the
heart
said
bearwarden
to
ayrault
when
you
show
me
his
ribs
i
will
follow
you
in
the
hole
ayrault
instantly
fired
for
a
point
just
back
of
the
left
foreleg
the
explosion
had
the
same
effect
as
on
the
mastodon
removing
a
of
hide
etc
and
the
next
second
bearwarden
sent
a
bullet
less
than
an
inch
from
where
had
stopped
before
the
colossus
could
turn
each
had
caused
several
explosions
in
close
proximity
to
the
first
the
creature
was
of
course
terribly
wounded
and
several
ribs
were
cracked
but
no
ball
had
gone
through
with
a
roar
it
made
straight
for
the
woods
and
with
surprising
agility
running
fully
as
fast
as
an
elephant
bearwarden
and
ayrault
kept
up
a
rapid
fire
at
the
left
hind
leg
and
soon
completely
disabled
it
the
dinosaur
however
supported
itself
with
its
huge
tail
and
continued
to
make
good
time
knowing
they
could
not
give
it
a
fatal
wound
at
the
intervening
distance
in
the
uncertain
light
they
stopped
firing
and
set
out
in
pursuit
cortlandt
paused
to
stop
the
bell
that
still
rang
and
then
put
his
best
foot
foremost
in
regaining
his
friends
for
half
a
mile
they
hurried
along
until
seeing
by
the
quantity
of
blood
on
the
ground
that
they
were
in
no
danger
of
losing
the
game
they
determined
to
save
their
strength
the
trail
entered
the
woods
by
a
narrow
ravine
passed
through
what
proved
to
be
but
a
belt
of
timber
and
then
turned
north
to
the
right
presently
in
the
they
saw
the
monster
head
against
the
sky
he
was
browsing
among
the
trees
tearing
off
the
young
branches
and
the
hunters
succeeded
in
getting
within
yards
before
being
discovered
just
as
he
began
to
run
the
two
rifles
again
fired
this
time
at
the
right
hind
leg
which
they
succeeded
in
hamstringing
after
that
the
triceratops
prorsus
was
at
their
mercy
and
they
quickly
put
an
end
to
its
suffering
the
sun
is
about
to
rise
said
bearwarden
in
a
few
minutes
we
shall
have
enough
light
they
cut
out
a
dozen
thick
slices
of
tenderloin
steak
and
soon
were
broiling
and
eating
a
substantial
breakfast
there
are
not
as
many
spectators
to
watch
us
eat
here
said
cortlandt
as
in
the
woods
i
suggest
that
after
returning
to
camp
for
our
blankets
and
things
we
steer
for
the
callisto
via
this
triceratops
to
see
what
creatures
have
been
attracted
by
the
body
on
finishing
their
meal
they
returned
to
the
place
at
which
they
had
passed
the
night
having
straightened
the
which
had
become
twisted
and
arranged
their
impedimenta
they
set
out
and
were
soon
once
more
beside
their
latest
victim
chapter
ix
the
honey
of
death
at
first
nothing
seemed
to
have
been
disturbed
when
they
suddenly
perceived
that
both
forelegs
were
missing
on
further
examination
they
found
that
the
ponderous
tail
seven
feet
in
diameter
was
cut
through
in
two
places
the
thicker
portion
having
disappeared
and
that
the
heavy
bones
in
this
extremity
of
the
vertebral
column
had
been
severed
like
straws
the
cut
surfaces
were
but
little
cooler
than
the
interior
of
the
body
showing
how
recently
the
mutilation
had
been
effected
by
all
the
gods
exclaimed
bearwarden
it
is
easy
to
see
the
method
in
this
the
hunters
have
again
cut
off
only
those
parts
that
could
be
easily
rolled
these
jovian
fellows
must
have
weapons
compared
with
which
the
old
scythe
chariots
would
be
but
toys
with
which
they
amputate
the
legs
of
their
victims
we
must
see
to
it
that
their
scimitars
do
not
come
too
near
to
us
and
i
venture
to
hope
that
in
our
bullets
they
will
find
their
match
what
say
you
doctor
i
see
no
depression
such
as
such
heavy
bodies
would
necessarily
have
made
had
they
been
rolled
along
the
ground
neither
does
it
seem
to
me
that
these
curious
tracks
in
the
sand
are
those
of
men
the
loose
earth
looked
as
if
the
of
some
railroad
had
been
removed
the
space
formerly
occupied
having
been
but
partly
filled
and
these
depressions
were
across
the
probable
direction
of
motion
whatever
was
capable
of
chasing
mastodons
and
carrying
such
weights
said
ayrault
will
i
suspect
have
little
to
fear
from
us
probably
nothing
short
of
light
artillery
would
leave
much
effect
i
dare
say
replied
bearwarden
we
had
better
give
the
unknown
quantity
a
wide
berth
though
i
would
give
a
year
salary
to
see
what
it
is
like
the
absence
of
other
tracks
shows
that
his
confreres
leave
jaw
alone
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
in
all
directions
they
resumed
their
march
along
the
third
side
of
the
square
which
was
to
bring
them
back
to
the
callisto
their
course
was
parallel
to
the
stream
and
on
comparatively
high
ground
cortlandt
gun
did
good
service
bringing
down
between
fifty
and
sixty
birds
that
usually
allowed
them
to
get
as
near
as
they
pleased
and
often
seemed
unwilling
to
leave
their
branches
by
the
time
they
were
ready
for
luncheon
they
saw
it
would
be
dark
in
an
hour
as
the
rapidity
of
the
planet
rotation
did
not
give
them
a
chance
to
become
tired
they
concluded
not
to
pitch
their
camp
but
to
resume
the
march
by
moonlight
which
would
be
easy
in
the
high
open
country
they
were
traversing
while
in
quest
of
they
came
upon
great
heaps
of
bones
mostly
those
of
birds
and
were
attracted
by
the
tall
flowers
growing
luxuriantly
in
their
midst
these
exhaled
a
most
delicious
perfume
and
at
the
centre
of
each
flower
was
a
viscous
liquid
the
colour
of
honey
if
this
tastes
as
well
as
it
looks
said
bearwarden
it
will
come
in
well
for
dessert
saying
which
he
thrust
his
finger
into
the
recesses
of
the
flower
intending
to
taste
the
essence
quietly
but
like
a
flash
the
flower
closed
his
hand
being
nearly
caught
and
badly
scratched
by
the
long
sharp
thorns
that
now
appeared
at
the
edges
ha
he
exclaimed
a
sensitive
and
you
may
almost
say
a
plant
this
doubtless
has
been
the
fate
of
these
birds
whose
bones
now
lie
bleaching
at
its
feet
after
they
have
nourished
its
lips
with
their
lives
no
doubt
the
plant
has
use
for
them
still
since
their
skeletons
may
serve
to
fertilize
its
roots
wishing
to
investigate
further
bearwarden
placed
one
of
the
birds
they
had
shot
within
the
bell
of
another
flower
which
immediately
contracted
with
such
force
that
they
saw
drops
of
blood
squeezed
out
after
some
minutes
the
flower
opened
as
beautiful
as
ever
and
discharged
an
oblong
ball
compressed
to
about
the
size
of
a
hen
egg
though
the
bird
that
was
placed
within
it
had
been
as
large
as
a
small
duck
towards
evening
these
flowers
sent
up
their
most
beautiful
song
to
hear
which
flocks
of
birds
came
from
far
and
near
alighting
on
the
trees
and
many
were
lured
to
death
by
the
siren
strains
and
the
honey
before
resuming
their
journey
the
travellers
paid
a
parting
visit
to
the
lilies
on
their
pyramids
of
bones
the
flowers
were
closed
for
the
night
and
the
travellers
saw
by
the
moonlight
that
the
white
mounds
were
simply
alive
with
snakes
these
coiled
themselves
flattened
their
heads
and
set
up
such
a
hissing
on
the
explorers
approach
that
they
were
glad
to
retire
and
leave
this
curious
contrast
of
hideousness
and
beauty
to
the
and
the
moons
marching
along
in
indian
file
the
better
to
avoid
treading
on
the
writhing
serpents
that
strewed
the
ground
they
kept
on
for
about
two
hours
they
frequently
passed
huge
heaps
or
mounds
of
bones
evidently
the
remains
of
bears
or
other
large
animals
the
carnivorous
plants
growing
at
their
centre
were
often
like
hollow
trees
and
might
easily
have
received
the
three
travellers
in
one
embrace
but
as
before
the
mounds
were
alive
with
serpents
that
evidently
made
them
their
homes
and
raised
an
angry
hiss
whenever
the
men
approached
the
wonder
to
me
said
bearwarden
is
that
these
snakes
do
not
protect
the
game
by
keeping
it
from
the
plants
it
may
be
that
they
do
not
show
themselves
by
day
or
when
the
victims
are
near
or
that
the
quadrupeds
on
which
these
plants
live
take
a
pleasure
like
deer
in
killing
them
by
jumping
with
all
four
feet
upon
their
backs
or
in
some
other
way
and
after
that
are
entrapped
by
the
flowers
shortly
after
midnight
they
rested
for
a
half
hour
but
the
dawn
found
them
trudging
along
steadily
though
somewhat
wearily
and
having
about
completed
the
third
side
of
their
square
accordingly
they
soon
made
a
turn
to
the
left
and
had
been
picking
their
way
over
the
rough
ground
for
nearly
two
hours
with
the
sun
already
high
in
the
sky
when
they
noticed
a
diminution
of
light
glancing
up
they
saw
that
one
of
the
moons
was
passing
across
the
sun
and
that
they
were
on
the
eve
of
a
total
eclipse
since
all
but
the
fifth
moon
said
cortlandt
revolve
exactly
in
the
plane
of
jupiter
equator
any
inhabitants
that
settle
there
will
become
accustomed
to
eclipses
for
there
must
be
one
of
the
sun
and
also
of
the
moons
at
each
revolution
or
about
hundred
in
every
jovian
year
the
reason
we
have
seen
none
before
is
because
we
are
not
exactly
on
the
equator
they
had
a
glimpse
of
the
coronal
streamers
as
the
last
portion
of
the
sun
was
covered
and
all
the
other
phenomena
that
attend
an
eclipse
on
earth
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
a
total
return
to
night
the
twinkling
stars
and
other
moons
shone
tranquilly
in
the
sky
and
even
the
noise
of
the
insects
ceased
presently
the
edge
of
the
sun
that
had
been
first
obscured
reappeared
and
then
nature
went
through
the
phenomenon
of
an
accelerated
dawn
without
awaiting
a
full
return
of
light
the
travellers
proceeded
on
their
way
and
had
gone
something
over
a
hundred
yards
when
ayrault
who
was
marching
second
suddenly
grasped
bearwarden
who
was
in
front
and
pointed
to
a
mass
straight
ahead
and
about
thirty
yards
from
a
pool
of
warm
water
from
which
a
cloud
of
vapour
arose
the
top
of
the
head
was
about
seven
feet
high
and
the
length
of
the
body
exceeded
thirty
feet
the
six
legs
looked
as
strong
as
steel
cables
and
were
about
a
foot
through
while
a
huge
bony
proboscis
nine
feet
in
length
preceded
the
body
this
was
carried
horizontally
between
two
and
three
feet
from
the
ground
presently
a
large
ground
sloth
came
to
the
pool
to
drink
lapping
up
the
water
at
the
sides
that
had
partly
cooled
in
an
instant
the
black
armored
monster
rushed
down
the
slope
with
the
speed
of
a
locomotive
and
seemed
about
as
formidable
the
sloth
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
and
for
a
moment
seemed
paralyzed
with
fear
it
then
started
to
run
but
it
was
too
late
for
the
next
second
the
enormously
exaggerated
ant
for
such
it
was
overtook
it
the
huge
mandible
shears
that
when
closed
had
formed
the
proboscis
snapped
viciously
taking
off
the
sloth
legs
and
then
cutting
its
body
to
slivers
the
execution
was
finished
in
a
few
seconds
and
the
ponderous
insect
carried
back
about
half
the
sloth
to
its
where
it
leisurely
devoured
it
this
reminds
me
said
bearwarden
of
the
old
lady
who
never
completed
her
preparations
for
turning
in
without
searching
for
burglars
under
the
bed
finally
she
found
one
and
exclaimed
in
delight
been
looking
for
you
fifty
years
and
at
last
you
are
here
the
question
is
now
that
we
have
found
our
burglar
what
shall
we
do
with
him
i
constantly
regret
not
having
a
rifle
replied
cortlandt
though
it
is
doubtful
if
even
that
would
help
us
here
let
us
sit
down
and
wait
said
ayrault
there
may
be
an
opening
soon
anon
a
woolly
rhinoceros
resembling
the
rhinoceros
tichorhinus
that
existed
contemporaneously
on
earth
with
the
mammoth
came
to
drink
the
water
that
had
partly
cooled
it
was
itself
a
beast
but
in
an
instant
the
monster
again
rushed
from
concealment
with
the
same
tremendous
speed
the
rhinoceros
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
and
lowering
its
head
faced
the
foe
the
ant
shears
however
passed
beneath
the
horn
and
fastening
upon
the
left
foreleg
cut
it
off
with
a
loud
snap
now
is
our
chance
exclaimed
cortlandt
we
may
kill
the
brute
before
he
is
through
with
the
rhinoceros
stop
a
bit
doctor
said
bearwarden
we
have
a
good
record
so
far
let
us
keep
up
our
reputation
for
being
sports
wait
till
he
can
attend
to
us
the
encounter
was
over
in
less
than
a
minute
three
of
the
rhinoceros
legs
being
taken
off
and
the
head
almost
severed
from
the
body
taking
up
the
legs
in
its
mandibles
the
murderous
creature
was
returning
to
its
lair
when
with
the
cry
of
now
for
the
fray
bearwarden
aimed
beneath
the
body
and
blew
off
one
of
the
farther
armoured
legs
from
the
inside
shoot
off
the
legs
on
the
same
side
he
counselled
ayrault
while
he
himself
kept
up
a
rapid
fire
cortlandt
tried
to
disconcert
the
enemy
by
raining
on
its
protected
eyes
while
the
two
rifles
tore
off
great
masses
of
the
horn
that
covered
the
enormously
powerful
legs
the
men
separated
as
they
retreated
knowing
that
one
slash
of
the
great
shears
would
cut
their
three
bodies
in
halves
if
they
were
caught
together
the
monster
had
dropped
the
remains
of
the
rhinoceros
when
attacked
and
made
for
the
hunters
at
its
top
speed
which
was
somewhat
reduced
by
the
loss
of
one
leg
before
it
came
within
cutting
distance
however
another
on
the
same
side
was
gone
ayrault
having
landed
a
bullet
on
a
spot
already
stripped
of
armour
after
this
the
men
had
no
difficulty
in
keeping
out
of
its
way
though
it
still
moved
with
some
speed
snipping
off
young
trees
in
its
path
like
grass
finally
having
blown
the
scales
from
one
eye
the
travellers
sent
in
a
bullet
that
exploded
in
the
brain
and
ended
its
career
this
has
been
by
all
odds
the
most
exciting
hunt
we
have
had
said
ayrault
both
on
account
of
the
determined
nature
and
great
speed
of
the
attack
and
the
almost
impossibility
of
finding
a
vulnerable
spot
anything
short
of
explosive
bullets
added
bearwarden
would
have
been
powerless
against
this
beast
for
the
armour
in
many
places
is
nearly
a
foot
thick
this
is
also
the
most
extraordinary
as
well
as
most
dangerous
creature
with
which
we
have
had
to
deal
said
cortlandt
because
it
is
an
enormously
enlarged
insect
with
all
the
inherent
ferocity
and
strength
it
is
almost
the
exact
counterpart
of
an
african
magnified
many
hundred
thousand
times
i
wonder
he
continued
thoughtfully
if
our
insects
may
not
be
the
deteriorated
in
point
of
size
descendants
of
the
monsters
of
mythology
and
geology
for
nothing
could
be
a
more
terrible
or
ferocious
antagonist
than
many
of
our
insects
if
sufficiently
enlarged
no
animal
now
alive
has
more
than
a
small
fraction
of
the
strength
in
proportion
to
its
size
of
the
minutest
spider
or
flea
it
may
be
that
through
lack
of
food
difficulties
imposed
by
changing
climate
and
the
necessity
of
burrowing
in
winter
or
through
some
other
conditions
changed
from
what
they
were
accustomed
to
their
size
has
been
reduced
and
that
the
huge
as
they
seemed
are
a
step
in
advance
of
this
specimen
in
the
march
of
deterioration
or
involution
which
will
end
by
making
them
as
insignificant
as
those
on
earth
these
ants
have
probably
come
into
the
woods
to
lay
their
eggs
for
from
the
behaviour
of
the
animals
we
watched
from
the
turtle
there
must
have
been
several
or
perhaps
a
war
is
in
progress
between
those
of
a
different
colour
as
on
earth
in
which
case
the
woods
may
be
full
of
them
doubtless
the
reason
the
turtle
seemed
so
unconcerned
at
the
general
uneasiness
of
the
animals
was
because
he
knew
he
could
make
himself
invulnerable
to
the
marauder
by
simply
closing
his
shell
and
we
were
unmolested
because
it
did
not
occur
to
the
ant
that
any
creatures
could
be
on
the
turtle
back
i
think
said
bearwarden
it
will
be
the
part
of
wisdom
to
return
to
the
callisto
and
do
the
rest
of
our
exploring
on
jupiter
from
a
safe
height
for
though
we
succeeded
in
disabling
this
beauty
it
was
largely
through
luck
and
had
we
not
done
so
we
should
probably
have
provided
a
bon
bouche
for
our
deceased
friend
instead
of
standing
at
his
grave
accordingly
they
proceeded
and
were
delighted
a
few
minutes
later
to
see
the
sunlight
reflected
from
the
polished
roof
chapter
x
changing
landscapes
on
reaching
the
callisto
ayrault
worked
the
lock
he
had
had
placed
on
the
lower
door
which
to
avoid
carrying
a
key
was
opened
by
a
combination
the
car
interior
was
exactly
as
they
had
left
it
and
they
were
glad
to
be
in
it
again
now
said
bearwarden
we
can
have
a
sound
and
undisturbed
sleep
which
is
what
i
want
more
than
anything
else
no
prowlers
can
trouble
us
here
and
we
shall
not
need
the
they
then
opened
a
window
in
each
side
for
the
large
glass
plates
admitting
the
sun
when
closed
made
the
callisto
rather
warm
and
placed
a
stout
wire
netting
within
them
to
keep
out
birds
and
bats
and
then
though
it
was
but
little
past
noon
got
into
their
comfortable
beds
and
slept
nine
hours
at
a
stretch
their
strong
metal
house
was
securely
at
rest
receiving
the
sunlight
and
shedding
the
rain
and
dew
as
it
might
have
done
on
earth
no
winds
or
storms
lightnings
or
floods
could
trouble
it
while
the
multiformed
monsters
of
antiquity
and
mythology
restored
in
life
with
which
the
terrestrials
had
been
thrown
into
such
close
contact
roamed
about
its
polished
walls
not
even
the
fiercest
could
affect
them
and
they
would
but
see
themselves
reflected
in
any
vain
assaults
the
domed
symmetrical
cylinder
stood
there
as
a
monument
to
human
ingenuity
and
skill
and
the
travellers
last
thought
as
they
fell
asleep
was
man
is
really
lord
of
creation
the
following
day
at
about
noon
they
awoke
and
had
a
bath
in
the
warm
pool
they
saw
the
armoured
mass
of
the
great
ant
evidently
undisturbed
while
the
bodies
of
its
victims
were
already
shining
skeletons
and
raised
a
small
cairn
of
stones
in
memory
of
the
struggle
they
had
had
there
we
should
name
this
place
kentucky
said
bearwarden
for
it
is
indeed
a
dark
and
bloody
ground
and
seeing
the
aptness
of
the
appellation
they
entered
it
so
on
their
charts
while
ayrault
got
the
batteries
in
shape
for
resuming
work
bearwarden
prepared
a
substantial
breakfast
this
consisted
of
oatmeal
and
cream
kept
hermetically
sealed
in
glass
a
dish
of
roast
grouse
coffee
pilot
bread
a
bottle
of
sauterne
and
another
of
rhine
wine
this
is
the
last
meal
we
shall
take
hereabouts
said
their
cook
as
they
plied
their
knives
and
forks
beneath
the
trees
so
here
is
a
toast
to
our
adventures
and
to
all
the
game
we
have
killed
they
drained
their
glasses
in
drinking
this
after
which
bearwarden
regaled
them
with
the
latest
song
which
he
had
at
his
tongue
end
about
an
hour
before
dark
they
their
projectile
and
as
a
mark
of
respect
to
their
little
ship
named
the
great
branch
of
the
continent
on
which
they
had
alighted
callisto
point
they
then
got
under
way
the
batteries
had
to
develop
almost
their
maximum
power
to
overcome
jupiter
attraction
but
they
were
equal
to
the
task
and
the
callisto
was
soon
in
the
air
directing
their
apergy
to
the
mountains
towards
the
interior
of
the
continent
and
applying
repulsion
to
any
ridge
or
hill
over
which
they
passed
thereby
easing
the
work
of
the
batteries
engaged
in
supporting
the
callisto
they
were
soon
sweeping
along
at
to
one
hundred
miles
an
hour
by
keeping
the
projectile
just
strongly
enough
charged
to
neutralize
gravitation
they
remained
for
the
most
part
within
two
hundred
feet
of
the
ground
seldom
rising
to
an
altitude
of
more
than
a
mile
and
were
therefore
able
to
keep
the
windows
at
the
sides
open
and
so
obtain
an
unobstructed
view
if
however
at
any
time
they
felt
oppressed
by
jupiter
high
barometric
pressure
and
preferred
the
terrestrial
conditions
they
had
but
to
rise
till
the
barometer
fell
to
thirty
then
if
an
object
of
interest
recalled
them
to
they
could
keep
the
callisto
inside
pressure
at
what
they
found
on
the
jovian
mountains
by
screwing
up
the
windows
on
account
of
the
distance
of
thousand
miles
from
jupiter
equator
to
the
pole
they
calculated
that
going
at
the
speed
of
a
hundred
miles
an
hour
night
and
day
it
would
take
them
terrestrial
days
to
reach
the
pole
even
from
latitude
two
degrees
at
which
they
started
but
they
knew
that
if
pressed
for
time
they
could
rise
above
the
limits
of
the
atmosphere
and
move
with
planetary
speed
while
if
they
wished
a
still
easier
method
of
pursuing
their
observation
they
had
but
to
remain
poised
between
the
sun
and
jupiter
beyond
the
latter
upper
air
and
photograph
or
map
it
as
it
revolved
before
them
by
sunset
they
had
gone
a
hundred
miles
wishing
to
push
along
they
closed
the
windows
rose
higher
to
avoid
any
that
might
be
invisible
in
the
moonlight
and
increased
their
speed
the
air
made
a
gentle
humming
sound
as
they
shot
through
it
and
towards
morning
they
saw
several
bright
points
of
light
in
which
they
recognized
by
the
aid
of
their
glasses
sheets
of
flame
and
torrents
of
molten
glowing
lava
bursting
at
intervals
or
pouring
steadily
from
several
volcanoes
from
this
they
concluded
they
were
again
near
an
ocean
since
volcanoes
need
the
presence
of
a
large
body
of
water
to
provide
steam
for
their
eruptions
with
the
rising
sun
they
found
the
scene
of
the
day
before
entirely
changed
they
were
over
the
shore
of
a
vast
ocean
that
extended
to
the
left
as
far
as
they
could
see
for
the
range
of
vision
often
exceeded
the
power
of
sight
the
ran
almost
due
north
and
south
while
the
volcanoes
that
dotted
it
and
that
had
been
luminous
during
the
night
now
revealed
their
nature
only
by
lines
of
smoke
and
vapours
they
were
struck
by
the
boldness
and
abruptness
of
the
scenery
the
mountains
and
cliffs
had
been
but
little
cut
down
by
water
and
frost
action
and
seemed
in
the
full
vigour
of
their
youth
which
was
what
the
travellers
had
a
right
to
expect
on
a
globe
that
was
still
cooling
and
shrinking
and
consequently
throwing
up
ridges
in
the
shape
of
mountains
far
more
rapidly
than
a
planet
as
matured
and
quiescent
as
the
earth
the
absence
of
lakes
also
showed
them
that
there
had
been
no
glacial
period
in
the
latitudes
they
were
crossing
for
a
very
long
time
we
can
account
for
the
absence
of
and
scratches
said
cortlandt
in
one
of
two
ways
either
the
proximity
of
the
internal
heat
to
the
surface
prevents
water
from
freezing
in
all
latitudes
or
jupiter
axis
has
always
been
very
nearly
perpendicular
to
its
orbit
and
consequently
the
thermometer
has
never
been
much
below
degrees
fahrenheit
for
at
the
considerable
distance
we
are
now
from
the
sun
it
is
easy
to
conceive
that
with
the
axis
much
inclined
there
might
be
cold
weather
during
the
northern
hemisphere
winter
that
would
last
for
about
six
of
our
years
even
as
near
the
equator
as
this
the
substantiation
of
an
at
the
pole
will
disprove
the
first
hypothesis
for
what
we
took
for
ice
before
alighting
may
have
been
but
banks
of
cloud
since
having
been
in
the
plane
of
the
planet
equator
at
the
time
we
had
naturally
but
a
very
oblique
view
of
the
poles
while
the
absence
of
glacial
scratches
shows
i
take
it
that
though
the
axis
may
have
been
a
good
deal
more
inclined
than
at
present
it
has
not
at
all
events
since
jupiter
palaeozoic
period
been
as
much
so
as
that
of
uranus
or
venus
the
land
on
jupiter
corresponding
to
the
laurentian
hills
on
earth
must
even
here
have
appeared
at
so
remote
a
period
that
the
first
surface
it
showed
must
long
since
have
been
worn
away
and
therefore
any
impressions
it
received
have
also
been
erased
comparing
this
land
with
the
photographs
we
took
from
space
i
should
say
it
is
the
eastern
of
the
two
continents
we
found
apparently
facing
each
other
their
present
form
i
take
to
be
only
the
skeleton
outline
of
what
they
will
be
at
the
next
period
of
jupiter
development
they
will
i
predict
become
more
like
half
moons
than
crescents
though
the
profile
may
be
much
indented
by
gulfs
and
bays
their
superficial
area
being
greatly
increased
and
the
intervening
ocean
correspondingly
narrowed
we
know
that
north
america
had
a
very
different
shape
during
the
cretaceous
or
even
the
middle
tertiary
period
from
what
it
has
now
and
that
the
gulf
of
mexico
extended
up
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
as
far
as
the
ohio
by
the
presence
of
a
great
coral
reef
in
the
ohio
river
near
cincinnati
we
know
also
that
florida
and
the
southeastern
atlantic
states
are
a
very
recent
addition
to
the
continent
while
the
pampas
of
the
argentine
republic
have
in
a
geological
sense
but
just
been
upheaved
from
the
sea
by
the
fact
that
the
rivers
are
all
on
the
surface
not
having
had
time
to
cut
down
their
channels
below
the
surrounding
country
by
similar
reasoning
we
know
that
the
canon
of
the
colorado
is
a
very
old
region
though
the
precipitateness
of
its
banks
is
due
to
the
absence
of
rain
for
a
local
would
cut
back
the
banks
having
most
effect
where
they
were
steepest
since
at
those
points
it
would
move
with
the
greatest
speed
thus
the
majestic
canon
owes
its
existence
to
two
things
the
length
of
time
the
river
has
been
at
work
and
the
fact
that
the
water
flowing
through
it
comes
from
another
region
where
of
course
there
is
rain
and
that
it
is
merely
in
transit
and
so
affects
only
the
bed
on
which
it
moves
granting
that
this
is
the
eastern
of
the
two
continents
we
observed
it
evidently
corresponds
more
in
shape
to
the
eastern
hemisphere
on
earth
than
to
the
new
world
both
of
which
are
set
facing
one
another
since
both
drain
towards
the
atlantic
ocean
but
the
analogy
here
holds
also
for
the
past
outlines
of
the
eastern
hemisphere
differed
radically
from
what
they
are
now
the
mediterranean
sea
was
formerly
of
far
greater
extent
than
we
see
it
and
covered
nearly
the
whole
of
northern
africa
and
the
old
upheaved
that
we
see
in
the
desert
of
sahara
much
of
this
great
desert
as
we
know
has
a
considerable
elevation
though
part
of
it
is
still
below
the
level
of
the
mediterranean
perhaps
a
more
striking
proof
of
this
than
are
the
remains
of
fishes
and
marine
life
that
are
found
there
is
the
dearth
of
natural
harbours
and
indentations
in
africa
northern
coast
while
just
opposite
in
southern
europe
there
are
any
number
which
shows
that
not
enough
time
has
elapsed
since
upheaval
for
liquid
or
congealed
water
to
produce
them
many
of
europe
best
harbours
and
boston
in
our
country
have
been
dug
out
by
slow
in
the
glacial
periods
the
black
and
caspian
seas
were
larger
than
we
now
find
them
while
the
adriatic
extended
much
farther
into
the
continent
covering
most
of
the
country
now
in
the
valley
of
the
po
in
europe
the
land
has
of
course
risen
also
but
so
slowly
that
the
rivers
have
been
able
to
keep
their
channels
cut
down
proof
of
their
ability
to
perform
which
feat
we
see
when
an
ancient
river
passes
through
a
ridge
of
hills
or
mountains
the
river
had
doubtless
been
there
long
before
the
mountains
began
to
rise
but
their
elevation
was
so
gradual
that
the
rate
of
the
cutting
down
equalled
or
exceeded
their
coming
up
proof
of
which
we
have
in
the
patent
fact
that
the
ancient
river
course
remains
unchanged
and
is
at
right
angles
to
the
mountain
chain
from
all
of
which
we
see
that
the
eastern
hemisphere
crescent
hollow
of
which
i
take
it
the
mediterranean
black
and
caspian
sea
depressions
are
the
remains
has
been
gradually
filled
in
by
the
elevation
of
the
sea
bottom
and
the
extension
of
deltas
from
the
detrital
matter
brought
from
the
high
interior
of
the
continents
by
the
rivers
or
by
the
combined
action
of
the
two
now
since
the
gulf
of
mexico
has
been
constantly
growing
smaller
and
the
mediterranean
is
being
invaded
by
the
land
i
reason
that
similar
causes
will
produce
like
effects
here
and
give
to
each
continent
an
area
far
greater
than
our
entire

the

we
behold
in

which
corresponds
to
our

it
is
far
more
of
a

the
geographical
sense

also
destined
to

four
days
later
after
crossing
a
ridge
of

that
the
pressure
on
the

barometer
showed
to
be
about
thousand
feet
high
and
a
stretch
of
flat
country
a
few
miles
in
width
they
came
to
a
great
arm
of
the
sea
it
was
about
thirty
miles
wide
at
its
mouth
which
was
narrowed
like
the
neck
of
a
bottle
and
farther
inland
was
over
one
hundred
miles
across
and
though
their
glasses
the
clear
air
and
the
planet
size
enabled
them
to
see
nearly
five
hundred
miles
they
could
not
find

on

rising

a
few

said
the

the

before

the

are
very
insignificant
the

trifling
and
altogether
it
seems
wonderful
how
the

could
have
procured

armed
with

in
this
machine
we
are
of
course
superior
to
the

it
is
not
likely
that
had

been
so
surrounded

he
could
have

his

notwithstanding
the
striking

of
these

to
their
terrestrial
counterparts
that
existed
on

during
its
corresponding

there
were
some

modifications
the

in

were
more
developed
while
the
eyes
of
all
were
larger
the
former
being
of

necessitated
by
the

by
the
greater

by
increasing
the
size
of
the
pupil
and
the
power
of
the
eye
in
the
development
of
the
ambulatory
muscles

again
see
her
handiwork
probably
brought
about

the
of

the
fishes
and
those

immersed

on
earth
the
weight
of
the
water
they
displace
is
increased
at
the
same
rate
also
and
their
buoyancy
remains
unchanged
if
the
development
of
life
here
so
closely
follows
its
lines
on
earth
with
the
exception
of
comparatively
slight
modifications
which
are
exactly
what
had
we
stopped
to
think
we
should
have
expected
to
find

we
not
reasonably
ask
whether
she
will
not
continue
on
these
lines
and
in
time
produce
beings
like
ourselves
but
with
more
powerful
muscles
and
eyes
capable
of
seeing
clearly
with
less
light
reasoning
by
analogy
we
can
come
to
no
other
conclusion
unless
their
advent
is
anticipated
by
the
arrival
of
colonists
from
the
more
advanced
earth
like
ourselves
in
that
case
man
by
pursuing
the
same
destructive
methods
that
he
has
pursued
in
regard
to
many
other
species
may
exterminate
the
intervening
links
and
so
arrest
evolution
before
leaving
deepwaters
bay
they
secured
a
pail
of
its
water
which
they
found
on
examination
contained
a
far
larger
percentage
of
salt
and
solid
material
than
the
oceans
on
earth
while
a
thermometer
that
they
immediately
immersed
in
it
soon
registered
degrees
fahrenheit
both
of
which
discoveries
confirmed
them
in
what
they
already
knew
namely
that
jupiter
had
advanced
comparatively
little
from
the
condition
in
which
the
water
on
the
surface
is
hot
in
which
state
the
earth
once
was
they
were
soon
beyond
the
estuary
at
which
they
had
stopped
to
study
the
forms
of
life
and
to
make
this
test
and
kept
on
due
north
for
several
days
occasionally
rising
above
the
air
as
their
familiarity
with
their
surroundings
increased
they
made
notes
of
several
things
the
mountains
covered
far
more
territory
at
their
bases
than
the
terrestrial
mountains
and
they
were
in
places
very
rugged
and
showed
vast
yawning
chasms
they
were
also
wooded
farther
up
their
sides
and
bore
but
little
snow
but
so
far
the
travellers
had
not
found
them
much
higher
than
those
on
earth
the
greatest
altitude
being
the
thousand
feet
south
of
deepwaters
bay
and
one
other
ridge
that
was
forty
thousand
so
that
compared
with
the
size
of
the
planet
and
its
continents
they
seemed
quite
small
and
the
continents
themselves
were
comparatively
level
they
also
noted
that
spray
was
blown
in
vast
sheets
till
the
ocean
for
miles
was
white
as
milk
the
wind
often
attained
tornado
strength
and
the
whole
surface
of
the
water
about
what
seemed
to
be
the
storm
centre
frequently
moved
with
rapidity
in
the
form
of
foam
yet
notwithstanding
this
the
waves
were
never
as
large
as
those
to
which
they
were
accustomed
on
earth
this
they
accounted
for
very
easily
by
the
fact
that
while
water
weighed
times
as
much
as
on
earth
the
pressure
of
air
was
but
little
more
than
half
as
much
again
and
consequently
its
effect
on
all
but
the
very
surface
of
the
heavy
liquid
was
comparatively
slight
gravity
is
a
useful
factor
here
observed
cortlandt
as
they
made
a
note
of
this
for
in
addition
to
giving
immunity
from
waves
it
is
most
effective
in
checking
the
elevation
of
high
mountains
or
in
the
high
latitudes
which
we
shall
doubtless
find
sufficiently
cool
or
even
cold
while
in
tropical
regions
which
might
otherwise
be
too
hot
it
interferes
with
them
least
on
account
of
being
partly
neutralized
by
the
rapid
rotation
with
which
all
four
of
the
major
planets
are
blessed
at
sunrise
the
following
morning
they
saw
they
were
approaching
another
great
arm
of
the
sea
it
was
over
a
thousand
miles
wide
at
its
mouth
and
had
not
the
photographs
showed
the
contrary
they
would
have
thought
the
callisto
had
reached
the
northern
end
of
the
continent
it
extended
into
the
land
fifteen
thousand
miles
and
on
account
of
the
shape
of
its
mouth
they
called
it
funnel
bay
rising
to
a
height
they
flew
across
and
came
to
a
great
peninsula
with
a
chain
of
mountains
on
either
side
the
southern
range
was
something
over
and
the
northern
something
less
than
five
thousand
feet
in
height
while
the
between
sloped
almost
imperceptibly
towards
the
middle
in
which
as
they
expected
they
found
a
river
compared
to
which
the
mississippi
or
the
amazon
would
be
but
a
brook
in
honour
of
the
president
of
the
terrestrial
axis
straightening
company
they
called
this
great
projection
which
averaged
about
four
thousand
miles
across
by
twelve
thousand
miles
long
bearwarden
peninsula
they
already
noticed
a
change
in
climate
the
ferns
and
palms
became
fewer
and
were
succeeded
by
pines
while
the
air
was
also
a
good
deal
cooler
which
was
easily
accounted
for
by
their
altitude
though
even
at
that
height
it
was
considerably
denser
than
at
level
on
earth
and
by
the
fact
that
they
were
already
near
latitude
thirty
the
exposed
points
on
the
plateau
as
also
the
summits
of
the
first
mountains
they
had
seen
before
alighting
were
devoid
of
vegetation
scarcely
so
much
as
a
blade
of
grass
being
visible
since
they
could
not
account
for
this
by
cold
they
concluded
that
the
most
probable
explanation
lay
in
the
tremendous
hurricanes
that
produced
by
the
planet
rapid
rotation
frequently
swept
along
its
surface
like
the
earth
but
with
far
more
violence
on
reaching
the
northern
coast
of
the
peninsula
they
increased
their
elevation
and
changed
their
course
to
northeast
not
caring
to
remain
long
over
the
great
body
of
water
which
they
named
cortlandt
bay
the
thousands
of
miles
of
foam
fast
flew
beneath
them
the
first
thing
attracting
their
attention
being
a
change
in
the
ocean
colour
in
the
eastern
shore
of
cortlandt
bay
they
soon
observed
the
mouth
of
a
river
ten
miles
across
from
which
this
tinted
water
issued
in
a
flood
on
account
of
its
colour
which
reminded
them
of
a
stream
they
knew
so
well
they
christened
it
the
harlem
believing
that
an
expedition
up
its
valley
might
reveal
something
of
interest
they
began
the
ascent
remaining
at
an
elevation
of
a
few
hundred
feet
for
about
three
hundred
miles
they
followed
this
river
which
had
but
few
bends
while
its
sides
became
more
and
more
precipitous
till
it
flowed
through
a
canon
four
and
a
half
miles
across
though
they
knew
from
the
wide
discoloration
of
cortlandt
bay
that
the
volume
of
water
discharged
was
tremendous
the
stream
seldom
moved
at
a
rate
of
more
than
five
miles
an
hour
and
for
a
time
was
free
from
rocks
and
rapids
from
which
they
concluded
that
it
must
be
very
deep
half
an
hour
later
they
saw
a
cloud
of
steam
or
mist
which
expanded
and
almost
obscured
the
sky
as
they
approached
next
they
heard
a
sound
like
distant
thunder
which
they
took
for
the
prolonged
eruption
of
some
giant
crater
though
they
had
not
expected
to
find
one
so
far
towards
the
interior
of
the
continent
presently
it
became
one
continuous
roar
the
echo
in
the
canon
whose
walls
were
at
this
place
over
six
hundred
feet
high
being
simply
deafening
so
that
the
near
discharge
of
the
heaviest
artillery
would
have
been
completely
drowned
one
would
think
the
end
of
the
world
was
approaching
shouted
cortlandt
through
his
hands
look
bearwarden
roared
back
the
wind
is
scattering
the
mist
as
he
spoke
the
vapoury
curtain
was
drawn
aside
revealing
a
waterfall
of
such
vast
proportions
as
to
dwarf
completely
anything
they
had
ever
seen
or
even
imagined
a
somewhat
open
horseshoe
lip
three
and
a
half
miles
straight
across
and
over
four
miles
following
the
line
of
the
curve
discharged
a
sheet
of
water
forty
feet
thick
at
the
edge
into
an
abyss
six
hundred
feet
below
two
islands
on
the
brink
divided
this
sheet
of
liquid
into
three
nearly
equal
parts
while
myriads
of
rainbows
hovered
in
the
clouds
of
spray
two
things
especially
struck
the
observers
the
water
made
but
little
curve
or
sweep
on
passing
over
the
edge
and
then
rushed
down
to
the
abyss
at
almost
lightning
speed
shivering
itself
to
infinitesimal
particles
on
striking
any
rock
or
projection
at
the
side
its
behaviour
was
of
course
due
to
its
weight
and
to
the
fact
that
on
jupiter
bodies
fall
feet
the
first
second
instead
of
sixteen
feet
as
on
earth
and
at
correspondingly
increasing
speed
finding
that
they
were
being
rapidly
dazed
and
stunned
by
the
noise
the
travellers
caused
the
callisto
to
rise
rapidly
and
were
soon
surveying
the
superb
sight
from
a
considerable
elevation
their
minds
could
grasp
but
slowly
the
full
meaning
and
titanic
power
of
what
they
saw
and
not
even
the
vast
falls
in
their
nearness
could
make
their
significance
clear
here
was
a
sheet
of
water
three
and
a
half
miles
wide
averaging
forty
feet
in
depth
moving
at
a
rapid
rate
towards
a
sheer
fall
of
six
hundred
feet
they
felt
as
they
gazed
at
it
that
the
power
of
that
waterfall
would
turn
backward
every
engine
and
dynamo
on
the
earth
and
it
seemed
as
if
it
might
almost
put
out
the
fires
of
the
sun
yet
it
was
but
an
illustration
of
the
action
of
the
solar
orb
exerted
on
a
vast
area
of
ocean
the
vapour
in
the
form
of
rain
being
afterwards
turned
into
these
comparatively
narrow
limits
by
the
topography
of
the
continent
compared
with
this
niagara
with
its
descent
of
less
than
two
hundred
feet
and
its
relatively
small
flow
of
water
would
be
but
a
rivulet
or
at
best
a
rapid
stream
reluctantly
leaving
the
fascinating
spectacle
they
pursued
their
exploration
along
the
river
above
the
falls
for
the
first
few
miles
the
surface
of
the
water
was
near
that
of
the
land
there
were
occasional
rapids
but
few
rocks
and
the
foaming
torrent
moved
at
great
speed
the
red
sandstone
banks
of
the
river
being
as
polished
as
though
they
had
been
waxed
after
a
while
the
obstructions
disappeared
but
the
water
continued
to
rush
and
surge
along
at
a
speed
of
ten
or
twelve
miles
an
hour
so
that
it
would
be
easily
navigable
only
for
logs
or
objects
moving
in
one
direction
the
surface
of
the
river
was
soon
on
an
average
fifty
feet
below
the
edge
of
the
banks
this
depression
being
one
result
of
the
water
rapid
motion
and
weight
which
facilitated
the
carving
of
its
channel
when
they
had
followed
up
the
river
about
sixty
miles
towards
its
source
they
came
upon
what
at
first
had
the
appearance
of
an
ocean
they
knew
however
from
its
elevation
and
the
flood
coming
from
it
that
the
water
must
be
fresh
as
they
soon
found
it
was
this
lake
was
about
three
hundred
miles
wide
and
stretched
from
northeast
to
southwest
there
was
rolling
land
with
hills
about
its
shores
and
the
foliage
on
the
banks
was
a
beautiful
shade
of
bluish
purple
instead
of
the
terrestrial
ubiquitous
green
when
near
the
great
lake
upper
end
they
passed
the
mouth
of
a
river
on
their
left
side
which
from
its
volume
they
concluded
must
be
the
principal
source
and
therefore
they
determined
to
trace
it
they
found
it
to
be
a
most
beautiful
stream
averaging
two
and
a
half
miles
in
width
evidently
very
deep
and
with
a
full
steady
current
after
proceeding
for
several
hours
they
found
that
the
general
placidity
grew
less
the
smooth
surface
occasionally
became
ruffled
by
projecting
rocks
and
rapids
and
the
banks
rose
till
the
voyagers
again
found
themselves
in
a
ravine
or
canon
during
their
sojourn
on
jupiter
they
had
had
but
little
experience
with
the
tremendous
winds
that
they
knew
from
reason
and
observation
must
rage
in
its
atmosphere
they
now
heard
them
whistling
over
their
heads
and
notwithstanding
the
protection
afforded
by
the
sides
of
the
canon
occasionally
received
a
gust
that
made
the
callisto
swerve
they
kept
on
steadily
however
till
sunset
at
which
time
it
became
very
dark
on
account
of
the
high
banks
which
rose
as
steeply
as
the
palisades
on
the
hudson
to
a
height
of
nearly
a
thousand
feet
finding
a
small
island
near
the
eastern
bank
they
were
glad
to
secure
the
callisto
there
for
the
night
below
the
reach
of
the
winds
which
they
still
heard
singing
loudly
but
with
a
musical
note
in
what
seemed
to
them
like
the
sky
it
is
incomprehensible
to
me
said
ayrault
as
they
sat
at
dinner
how
the
sun
at
a
distance
of
four
hundred
and
million
miles
can
raise
the
amount
of
water
we
have
here
passing
us
and
compared
with
which
the
discharge
of
the
greatest
river
on
earth
would
be
insignificant
to
say
nothing
of
the
stream
we
ascended
before
reaching
this
we
must
remember
replied
cortlandt
that
many
of
the
conditions
are
different
here
from
those
that
exist
on
earth
we
know
that
some
of
the
streams
are
warm
and
even
hot
and
that
the
temperature
of
deepwaters
bay
and
doubtless
that
of
the
ocean
also
is
considerably
higher
than
ours
this
would
facilitate
evaporation
the
density
of
the
atmosphere
and
the
tremendous
winds
of
which
i
suspect
we
may
see
more
later
must
also
help
the
sun
very
much
in
its
work
of
raising
vapour
but
the
most
potent
factor
is
undoubtedly
the
vast
size
of
the
basin
that
these
rivers
drain
the
great
speed
at
which
the
atmospheric
currents
move
said
bearwarden
coupled
with
the
comparative
lowness
of
the
mountain
chains
and
the
slight
obstruction
they
offer
to
their
passage
must
distribute
the
rain
very
thoroughly
notwithstanding
the
great
unbroken
area
of
the
continents
there
can
be
no
such
state
of
things
here
as
exists
in
the
western
part
of
south
america
where
the
andes
are
so
high
that
any
clouds
in
crossing
them
are
shoved
up
so
far
into
a
cold
region
that
all
moisture
they
may
have
brought
from
the
pacific
is
condensed
into
rain
with
which
parts
of
the
western
slope
are
deluged
while
clouds
from
the
atlantic
have
come
so
far
they
have
already
dispersed
their
moisture
in
consequence
of
which
the
region
just
east
of
the
andes
gets
little
if
any
rain
it
is
bad
for
a
continent
to
have
its
high
mountains
near
the
ocean
from
which
it
should
get
its
rain
and
good
for
it
to
have
them
set
well
back
i
should
not
be
surprised
said
cortlandt
if
we
saw
another
waterfall
though
not
in
the
shape
of
rain
in
the
hour
before
we
stopped
we
began
to
see
rapids
and
protruding
rocks
that
means
that
we
are
coming
to
a
part
of
the
channel
that
is
comparatively
new
since
the
older
parts
have
had
time
to
wear
smooth
i
take
it
then
that
we
are
near
the
foot
of
a
retreating
cascade
which
we
may
hope
soon
to
see
that
is
exactly
the
order
in
which
we
found
smooth
water
and
rapids
in
river
no
which
we
have
named

after
this
not
being

they
used

for
recording
their
recent

chapter
xii
hills
and
valleys
with
the
first
light
they
resumed
their
journey
and
an
hour
after
setting
out
they
sighted
as
cortlandt
had
predicted
another
cloud
of
vapour
the
fall
for
such
it
proved
to
be
was
more
beautiful
than
the
other
for
though
the
volume
of
water
was
not
so
great
it
fell
at
one
leap
without
a
break
and
at
the
same
tremendous
speed
a
distance
of
more
than
a
thousand
feet
the
canon
rang
with
the
echoes
while
the
spray
flew
in
sheets
against
the
smooth
glistening
sandstone
walls
instead
of
coming
from
a
river
as
the
first
fall
had
this
poured
at
once
from
the
rocky
lip
about
two
miles
across
of
a
lake
that
was
eleven
hundred
feet
above
the
surging
mass
in
the
vale
below
it
is
a
thousand
pities
said
bearwarden
that
this
cataract
has
got
so
near
its
source
for
at
the
rate
these
streams
must
cut
this
one
in
a
few
hundred
years
unless
something
is
done
to
prevent
it
will
have
worn
back
to
the
lake
and
then
to
the
falls
which
will
become
a
series
of
rapids
perhaps
the
first
effect
will
be
merely
to
reduce
by
a
few
feet
the
height
of
the
falls
in
which
case
they
will
remain
in
practically
the
same
place
about
the
shores
of
this
lake
they
saw
rhinoceroses
with
long
thick
wool
and
herds
of
creatures
that
much
resembled
buffaloes
i
do
not
see
said
bearwarden
why
the
identical
species
should
not
exist
here
that
till
recently
in
a
geological
sense
inhabited
the
earth
the
climate
and
all
other
conditions
are
practically
the
same
on
both
planets
except
a
trifling
difference
in
weight
to
which
terrestrials
would
soon
adapt
themselves
we
know
by
spectroscopic
analysis
that
hydrogen
iron
magnesium
and
all
our
substances
exist
in
the
sun
and
even
the
stars
while
the
earth
contains
everything
we
have
found
in
meteorites
then
why
make
an
exception
of
life
instead
of
supposing
that
at
corresponding
periods
of
development
the
same
living
forms
inhabit
all
it
would
be
assuming
the
eternal
sterilization
of
the
functions
of
nature
to
suppose
that
our
earth
is
the
only
body
that
can
produce
them
the
world
of
organic
life
is
so
much
more
complex
replied
cortlandt
than
that
of
the
crystal
that
it
requires
great
continuity
so
far
we
certainly
have
seen
no
men
or
anything
like
them
not
even
so
much
as
a
monkey
though
i
suppose
according
to
your
reasoning
jupiter
has
not
advanced
far
enough
to
produce
even
that
exactly
replied
bearwarden
for
it
will
require
vast
periods
and
according
to
my
belief
at
least
half
the
earth
time
of
habitability
had
passed
before
man
appeared
but
we
see
jupiter
is
admirably
suited
for
those
who
have
been
developed
somewhere
else
and
it
would
be
an
awful
shame
if
we
allowed
it
to
lie
unimproved
till
it
produces
appreciative
inhabitants
of
its
own
for
we
find
more
to
admire
in
one
than
its
entire
present
population
during
its
lifetime
yet
how
magnificent
this
world
is
and
how
superior
in
its
natural
state
to
ours
the
mountainous
horns
of
these
continents
protect
them
and
the
ocean
they
enclose
from
the
cold
polar
marine
currents
and
in
a
measure
from
the
icy
winds
while
the
elevated
country
on
the
horns
near
the
equator
might
be
a
garden
of
eden
or
ideal
resort
to
be
sure
the
continents
might
support
a
larger
population
if
more
broken
up
notwithstanding
the
advantage
resulting
from
the
comparatively
low
mountains
along
the
coasts
and
the
useful
winds
a
greater
subdivision
of
land
and
water
more
great
islands
connected
by
isthmuses
and
more
mediterraneans
joined
by
straits
would
be
a
further
advantage
to
commerce
but
with
the
sources
of
power
at
hand
the
resistless
winds
and
much
increased
in
effectiveness
by
their
weight
the
great
tides
when
several
moons
are
on
the
same
side
or
opposite
the
sun
internal
heat
near
the
surface
and
abundant
doubtless
already
formed
and
also
near
the
surface
such
small
alterations
could
be
made
very
easily
and
would
serve
merely
to
prevent
our
becoming
rusty
as
jupiter
distance
from
the
sun
varies
from
miles
at
aphelion
to
only
at
perihelion
this
difference
in
connection
with
even
the
slight
inclination
of
the
axis
must
make
a
slight
change
in
seasons
but
as
the
inclination
is
practically
nothing
almost
the
entire
change
results
from
the
difference
in
distance
this
means
that
the
rise
or
fall
in
temperature
is
general
on
every
degree
of
latitude
all
being
warmed
simultaneously
more
or
less
as
the
planet
approaches
or
departs
from
the
sun
it
means
also
that
about
the
same
conditions
that
secretary
deepwaters
suggested
as
desirable
for
the
earth
prevail
here
and
that
jupiter
represents
therefore
about
the
acme
of
climate
naturally
provided
on
account
of
its
rapid
rotation
and
vast
size
the
winds
have
a
strength
but
they
are
nothing
at
this
distance
from
the
sun
to
what
they
would
be
if
a
planet
with
its
present
rate
of
rotation
and
size
were
where
venus
or
even
the
earth
is
in
either
of
these
positions
no
land
life
with
which
we
are
acquainted
could
live
on
the
surface
for
the
slope
of
the
atmospheric
isobars
the
lines
of
equal
barometric
pressure
that
produce
wind
by
becoming
tilted
through
unequal
expansion
after
which
the
air
as
it
were
flows
would
be
too
great
the
ascending
currents
about
the
equator
would
also
of
course
be
vastly
strengthened
so
that
we
see
a
wise
dispensation
of
providence
in
placing
the
large
planets
which
also
rotate
so
rapidly
at
a
great
distance
from
the
sun
which
is
the
father
of
all
winds
rotation
alone
however
rapid
being
unable
to
produce
them
they
found
this
lake
was
about
six
times
the
size
of
lake
superior
and
that
several
large
and
small
streams
ran
into
its
upper
end
these
had
their
sources
in
smaller
lakes
that
were
at
slightly
higher
elevations
though
the
air
was
cool
the
sun
shone
brightly
while
the
ground
was
covered
with
flowers
resembling
those
of
the
northern
climes
on
earth
of
all
shapes
and
lines
twice
a
day
these
sent
up
their
song
and
trees
were
covered
with
buds
and
the
birds
twittered
gaily
the
streams
murmured
and
bubbled
and
all
things
reminded
the
travellers
of
early
morning
in
spring
if
anything
could
reconcile
me
said
bearwarden
to
exchange
my
active
utilitarian
life
for
a
rustic
poetical
existence
it
would
be
this
place
for
it
is
far
more
beautiful
than
anything
i
have
seen
on
earth
it
needs
but
a
maud
muller
and
a
few
cows
to
complete
the
picture
since
nature
gives
us
a
vision
of
eternal
peace
and
repose
somehow
the
mention
of
maud
muller
and
the
delicate
and
refined
flowers
whose
perfume
he
inhaled
brought
up
thoughts
that
were
never
far
below
the
surface
in
ayrault
mind
the
place
is
heavenly
enough
said
he
to
make
one
wish
to
live
and
remain
here
forever
but
to
me
it
would
be
hamlet
with
hamlet
left
out
ah
poor
chap
said
cortlandt
you
are
in
love
but
you
are
not
to
be
pitied
for
though
the
thrusts
at
the
heart
are
sharp
they
may
be
the
sweetest
that
mortals
know
the
following
morning
they
reluctantly
left
the
picturesque
shores
of
lake
serenity
with
their
beautiful
tints
and
foliage
and
resumed
the
journey
to
explore
a
number
of
islands
in
the
ocean
in
the
west
which
were
recorded
on
their
negatives
ascending
to
rarefied
air
they
saw
great
chains
of
mountains
which
they
imagined
ran
parallel
to
the
coast
rising
to
considerable
altitudes
in
the
east
the
tops
of
all
glistened
with
a
mantle
of
snow
in
the
sunlight
while
between
the
ridges
they
saw
darker
and
evidently
fertile
valleys
they
passed
moving
northwest
over
large
and
small
lakes
all
evidently
part
of
the
same
great
system
and
continued
to
sweep
along
for
several
days
with
a
beautiful
panorama
as
varying
as
a
kaleidoscope
spread
beneath
their
eyes
they
observed
that
the
character
of
the
country
gradually
changed
the
symmetrically
rounded
mountains
and
hills
began
to
show
angles
while
great
slabs
of
rock
were
split
from
the
faces
the
sides
also
became
less
vertical
and
there
was
an
accumulation
of
detrital
fragments
about
their
bases
these
heaps
of
fractured
stone
had
in
some
cases
begun
to
disintegrate
and
form
soil
on
which
there
was
a
scant
growth
of
vegetation
but
the
sides
and
summits
whose
jaggedness
increased
with
their
height
were
absolutely
bare
here
said
cortlandt
we
have
unmistakable
evidence
of
frost
and
ice
action
the
next
interesting
question
is
how
recently
has
denudation
occurred
the
absence
of
plant
life
at
the
exposed
places
he
continued
as
if
lecturing
to
a
class
can
be
accounted
for
here
as
nearer
the
equator
by
the
violence
of
the
wind
but
i
greatly
doubt
whether
water
will
now
freeze
in
this
latitude
at
any
season
of
the
year
for
even
should
the
northern
hemisphere
very
insignificant
winter
coincide
with
the
planet
aphelion
the
necessary
drop
from
the
present
temperature
would
be
too
great
to
be
at
all
probable
if
then
it
is
granted
that
ice
does
not
form
here
now
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
has
done
so
the
most
plausible
conclusion
is
that
the
inclination
of
jupiter
axis
is
automatically
changing
as
we
know
the
earth
has
often
done
there
being
nothing
incompatible
in
this
view
with
the
evidence
at
hand
we
can
safely
assume
it
correct
for
the
time
being
at
least
when
farther
south
you
remember
we
found
no
trace
of
ice
action
notwithstanding
the
comparative
slowness
with
which
we
decided
that
the
ridges
in
the
crust
had
been
upheaved
on
account
of
the
resisting
power
of
gravity
and
as
i
see
now
also
on
account
of
jupiter
great
mass
which
must
prevent
its
losing
its
heat
anything
like
as
fast
as
the
earth
has
in
which
i
think
also
we
have
the
explanation
of
the
comparatively
low
elevation
of
the
mountains
that
we
found
we
could
not
account
for
by
the
power
of
gravitation
alone
from
the
fact
that
the
exposed
surface
farther
south
must
be
old
on
account
of
the
slow
upheaval
and
the
slight
wear
to
which
it
is
exposed
about
the
only
wearing
agent
being
the
wind
which
would
be
powerless
to
erase
especially
since
on
account
of
gravity
power
it
can
not
like
our
desert
winds
carry
much
sand
which
as
we
know
has
cut
away
the
base
of
the
sphinx
i
think
it
is
logical
to
conclude
that
though
jupiter
axis
is
changing
naturally
as
the
earth
has
been
it
has
never
varied
as
much
as
and
a
half
degrees
and
certainly
to
nothing
like
the
extent
to
which
we
see
venus
and
uranus
tilted
it
is
well
known
that
mountain
chains
are
but
ridges
or
foldings
in
the
crust
upheaved
as
the
interior
cools
and
shrinks
this
is
proved
by
reason
and
by
experiments
with
viscous
clay
or
other
material
placed
upon
a
sheet
of
stretched
rubber
which
is
afterwards
allowed
to
contract
whereupon
the
analogues
of
mountain
ridges
are
thrown
up
i
follow
you
said
bearwarden
and
do
not
see
how
we
could
arrive
at
anything
else
from
jupiter
low
specific
gravity
weighing
but
little
more
than
an
equal
bulk
of
water
i
should
say
the
interior
must
be
very
hot
or
else
is
composed
of
light
material
for
the
crust
surface
or
the
part
we
see
is
evidently
about
as
dense
as
what
we
have
on
earth
these
things
have
puzzled
me
a
good
deal
and
i
have
been
wondering
if
jupiter
may
not
have
been
formed
before
the
earth
and
the
smaller
planets
the
discrepancies
between
even
the
best
authorities
replied
cortlandt
show
that
as
yet
but
little
has
been
discovered
from
the
earth
concerning
jupiter
real
condition
the
two
theories
that
try
to
account
for
its
genesis
are
the
ring
theory
and
the
nebulous
we
know
that
the
sun
is
constantly
emitting
vast
volumes
of
heat
and
light
and
that
with
the
exception
of
the
heat
resulting
from
the
impact
of
falling
meteors
it
receives
none
from
outside
the
principal
source
being
the
tremendous
friction
and
pressure
between
the
cooling
and
shrinking
strata
within
the
great
mass
of
the
sun
itself
a
seeming
paradox
therefore
comes
in
here
which
must
be
considered
if
the
sun
were
composed
entirely
of
gas
it
would
for
a
time
continue
to
grow
hotter
but
the
sun
is
incessantly
radiating
light
and
heat
and
consequently
becoming
smaller
therefore
the
farther
back
we
go
the
hotter
we
find
the
sun
and
also
the
larger
till
instead
of
having
a
diameter
of
eight
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
miles
it
filled
the
space
now
occupied
by
the
entire
solar
system
here
is
where
the
two
theories
start
according
to
the
first
the
revolving
nebulous
mass
threw
off
a
ring
that
became
the
planet
neptune
afterwards
another
that
contained
the
material
for
uranus
and
so
on
the
lightest
substance
in
the
sun
being
thrown
off
first
by
which
they
accounted
for
the
lightness
of
the
four
great
planets
and
finally
mars
the
earth
and
the
small
dense
planets
near
the
sun
the
advocates
of
this
theory
pointed
to
saturn
rings
as
an
illustration
of
the
birth
of
a
planet
or
rather
in
that
case
a
satellite
according
to
this
the
major
planets
have
had
a
far
longer
separate
existence
than
the
minor
which
would
account
for
their
being
so
advanced
notwithstanding
their
size
this
theory
may
again
come
into
general
acceptance
but
for
the
present
it
has
been
discredited
by
the
nebulous
according
to
this
second
theory
at
the
time
the
sun
filled
all
the
space
inside
of
neptune
orbit
or
extended
even
farther
several
centres
of
condensation
were
formed
within
the
nebulous
gaseous
mass
the
greatest
centre
became
the
sun
and
the
others
large
and
small
the
planets
which
as
a
result
of
the
spiral
motion
of
the
whole
such
as
is
now
going
on
before
our
eyes
in
the
great
nebulae
of
one
canuin
venaticorum
and
many
others
began
to
revolve
about
the
greatest
central
body
of
gas
as
the
separate
masses
cooled
they
shrank
and
their
surfaces
or
extreme
edges
which
at
first
were
contiguous
began
to
recede
which
recession
is
still
going
on
with
some
rapidity
on
the
part
of
the
sun
for
we
may
be
sure
its
diameter
diminishes
as
its
density
increases
according
to
either
theory
as
i
see
it
the
major
planets
on
account
of
their
distance
from
the
central
mass
have
had
longer
separate
existences
than
the
minor
and
are
therefore
more
advanced
than
they
would
be
had
all
been
formed
at
the
same
time
this
theory
explains
the
practical
uniformity
in
the
chemical
composition
of
all
members
of
this
system
by
assuming
that
they
were
all
once
a
part
of
the
same
body
and
you
may
say
brothers
and
sisters
of
the
sun
instead
of
its
offspring
it
also
makes
size
the
only
factor
determining
temperature
and
density
but
of
course
modified
by
age
since
otherwise
jupiter
would
have
a
far
less
developed
crust
than
that
with
which
we
find
it
i
have
always
considered
the
period
from
the
molten
condition
to
that
with
a
crust
as
comparatively
short
which
stands
to
reason
for
radiation
has
then
no
check
and
the
period
from
the
formation
of
the
crust
which
acts
as
a
blanket
to
the
death
of
a
planet
as
very
long
i
have
not
found
this
view
clearly
set
forth
in
any
of
the
books
i
have
read
but
it
seems
to
me
the
simplest
and
most
natural
explanation
now
granted
that
the
solar
system
was
once
a
nebula
on
which
i
think
every
one
will
agree
the
same
forces
that
changed
it
into
a
system
of
sun
and
planets
must
be
at
work
on
canum
venaticorum
andromeda
and
nine
virginis
and
must
inevitably
change
them
to
suns
each
with
doubtless
a
system
of
planets
if
then
the
condition
of
a
nebula
or
star
depends
simply
on
its
size
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
andromeda
sirius
and
all
the
vast
bodies
we
see
were
created
at
the
same
time
as
our
system
which
involves
the
necessity
of
one
general
and
simultaneous
creation
day
but
as
sirius
with
its
diameter
of
twelve
million
miles
must
be
larger
than
some
of
the
nebulae
will
be
when
equally
condensed
we
must
suppose
rather
that
nebulae
are
forming
and
coming
into
the
condition
of
bright
and
dead
stars
much
as
apples
or
pears
on
a
fruit
tree
are
constantly
growing
and
developing
so
that
the
mosaic
description
of
the
creation
would
probably
apply
in
point
of
time
only
to
our
system
or
perhaps
to
our
globe
though
the
rest
will
doubtless
pass
through
precisely
the
same
stages
this
i
think
i
will
publish
on
our
return
as
the
cortlandt
astronomical
doctrine
as
the
most
rational
i
have
seen
devised
and
one
that
i
think
we
may
safely
believe
until
perhaps
through
increased
knowledge
it
can
be
disproved
after
they
crossed
a
line
of
hills
that
ran
at
right
angles
to
their
course
they
found
the
country
more
rolling
all
streams
and
flowed
in
their
direction
while
their
aneroid
showed
them
that
they
were
gradually
descending
when
they
were
moving
along
near
the
surface
of
the
ground
a
delicious
and
refined
perfume
exhaled
by
the
blue
and
white
flowers
that
had
been
growing
smaller
as
they
journeyed
northward
frequently
reached
their
nostrils
to
cortlandt
and
bearwarden
it
was
merely
the
scent
of
a
flower
but
to
ayrault
it
recalled
mental
pictures
of
sylvia
wearing
violets
and
lilies
that
he
had
given
her
he
knew
that
the
greatest
telescopes
on
earth
could
not
reveal
the
callisto
moving
about
in
jupiter
sunshine
as
even
a
point
of
light
at
that
distance
and
notwithstanding
cortlandt
learning
and
bearwarden
joviality
he
felt
at
times
extremely
lonely
they
swept
along
steadily
for
fifty
hours
having
bright
sunny
days
and
beautifully
moonlit
nights
they
passed
over
finely
rounded
hills
and
valleys
and
watered
plains
as
they
approached
the
ocean
and
its
level
the
temperature
rose
and
there
was
more
moisture
in
the
air
the
plants
and
flowers
also
increased
in
size
again
resembling
somewhat
the
large
species
they
had
seen
near
the
equator
this
would
be
the
place
to
live
said
bearwarden
looking
at
iron
mountains
silver
copper
and
lead
formations
primeval
forests
rich
prairies
and
regions
evidently
underlaid
with
coal
and
petroleum
not
to
mention
huge
beds
of
aluminum
clay
and
other
natural
resources
that
made
his
materialistic
mouth
water
it
would
be
joy
and
delight
to
develop
industries
here
with
no
snow
avalanches
to
clog
your
railroads
or
icy
blizzards
to
paralyze
work
nor
weather
that
blights
you
with
and
fevers
on
our
return
to
the
earth
we
must
organize
a
company
to
run
regular
interplanetary
lines
we
could
start
on
this
globe
all
that
is
best
on
our
own
think
what
boundless
possibilities
may
be
before
the
human
race
on
this
planet
which
on
account
of
its
vast
size
will
be
in
its
prime
when
our
insignificant
earth
is
cold
and
dead
and
no
longer
capable
of
supporting
life
think
also
of
the
indescribable
blessing
to
the
congested
communities
of
europe
and
america
to
find
an
unlimited
outlet
here
mars
is
already
past
its
prime
and
venus
scarcely
habitable
but
in
jupiter
we
have
a
new
promised
land
compared
with
which
our
earth
is
a
pygmy
or
but
little
more
than
microscopic
i
see
said
ayrault
that
the
possibilities
here
have
no
limit
but
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
compare
it
to
the
promised
land
since
till
we
undertook
this
journey
no
one
had
even
thought
of
jupiter
as
a
habitable
place
i
trace
the
divine
promise
replied
bearwarden
in
what
you
described
to
us
on
earth
as
man
innate
longing
and
desire
to
rise
and
in
the
fact
that
the
almighty
has
given
the
race
unbounded
expansiveness
in
very
limited
space
this
would
look
to
me
as
the
return
of
man
to
the
garden
of
eden
through
intellectual
development
for
here
every
man
can
sit
under
his
own
vine
and
it
seems
to
me
said
cortlandt
that
no
paradise
or
heaven
described
in
anything
but
the
bible
compares
with
this
according
to
virgil
description
the
joys
on
the
banks
of
his
river
lethe
must
have
been
most
sad
and
dreary
the
general
idleness
and
monotony
apparently
being
broken
only
by
wrestling
matches
between
the
children
while
the
rest
strolled
about
with
laurel
wreaths
or
rested
in
the
shade
the
pilot
palinurus
who
had
been
drowned
by
falling
overboard
while
asleep
but
who
before
that
had
presumably
done
his
duty
did
not
seem
especially
happy
while
the
harsh
resentful
disposition
evidently
remained
unsoftened
for
dido
became
like
a
cliff
of
marpesian
marble
when
aeneas
asked
to
be
forgiven
though
he
had
doubtless
considered
himself
in
duty
bound
to
leave
her
having
been
twice
commanded
to
do
so
by
mercury
the
messenger
of
jove
she
like
the
rest
seems
to
have
had
no
occupation
while
the
consciences
of
few
appear
to
have
been
sufficiently
clear
to
enable
them
to
enjoy
unbroken
rest
the
idleness
in
the
of
all
profane
writers
added
bearwarden
has
often
surprised
me
too
though
i
have
always
recommended
a
certain
amount
of
recreation
for
my
staff
in
fact
more
than
i
have
generally
had
myself
an
excess
of
it
becomes
a
bore
i
think
that
all
real
progress
comes
through
thorough
work
why
should
we
assume
that
progress
ceases
at
death
i
believe
in
the
verse
that
says
learn
here
on
earth
those
things
the
knowledge
of
which
is
perfected
in
heaven
according
to
that
said
cortlandt
you
will
some
day
be
setting
the
axis
of
heaven
right
for
in
order
to
do
work
there
must
be
work
to
be
done
a
necessary
corollary
to
which
is
that
heaven
is
still
imperfect
no
said
bearwarden
bristling
up
at
the
way
cortlandt
sometimes
received
his
speeches
it
means
simply
that
its
development
though
perfect
so
far
as
it
goes
may
not
be
finished
and
that
we
may
be
the
means
as
on
earth
of
helping
it
along
the
conditions
constituting
heaven
said
ayrault
may
be
as
fixed
as
the
laws
of
nature
though
the
products
of
those
conditions
might
it
seems
to
me
still
be
forming
and
subject
to
modification
thereby
the
reductio
ad
absurdu
would
of
course
apply
if
we
supposed
the
work
of
creation
absolutely
finished
chapter
xiii
discoveries
two
days
later
on
the
western
horizon
they
beheld
the
ocean
many
of
the
streams
whose
sources
they
had
seen
when
they
crossed
the
divide
from
the
lake
basin
and
whose
courses
they
had
followed
were
now
rivers
a
mile
wide
with
the
tide
ebbing
and
rising
within
them
many
hundreds
of
miles
from
their
mouths
when
they
reached
the
shore
line
they
found
the
waves
breaking
as
on
earth
upon
the
sands
but
with
this
difference
they
had
before
noted
the
smallness
of
the
undulations
compared
with
the
strength
of
the
wind
the
result
of
the
water
weight
these
waves
now
reminded
them
of
the
behaviour
of
mercury
or
of
melted
lead
when
stirred
on
earth
by
the
rapidity
with
which
the
crests
dropped
though
the
wind
was
blowing
an
gale
there
was
but
little
combing
and
when
there
was
any
it
lasted
but
a
second
the
one
effort
of
the
crests
and
waves
seemed
to
be
to
remain
at
rest
or
if
stirred
in
spite
of
themselves
to
subside
when
over
the
surface
of
the
ocean
the
voyagers
rose
to
a
height
of
thirty
thousand
metres
and
after
four
travelling
saw
at
a
distance
of
about
two
hundred
miles
what
looked
like
another
continent
but
which
they
knew
must
be
an
island
on
finding
themselves
above
it
they
rose
still
higher
to
obtain
a
view
of
its
outlines
and
compare
its
shape
with
that
of
the
islands
in
the
photographs
they
had
had
time
to
develop
the
length
ran
from
southeast
to
northwest
though
crossed
by
latitude
forty
and
notwithstanding
jupiter
distance
from
the
sun
the
southern
side
had
a
very
luxuriant
vegetation
that
was
almost
this
they
accounted
for
by
its
total
immunity
from
cold
the
density
of
the
air
at
and
the
warm
moist
breezes
it
received
from
the
tepid
ocean
the
climate
was
about
the
same
as
that
of
the
riviera
or
of
florida
in
winter
and
there
was
of
course
no
parching
summer
this
shows
me
said
bearwarden
that
a
country
climate
depends
less
on
the
amount
of
heat
it
receives
from
the
sun
than
on
the
amount
it
retains
proof
of
which
we
have
in
the
tops
of
the
himalayas
perpetually
covered
with
snow
and
mountains
on
the
very
equator
where
they
get
the
most
direct
rays
and
where
those
rays
have
but
little
air
to
penetrate
it
shows
that
the
presence
of
a
substantial
atmosphere
is
as
necessary
a
part
of
the
calculation
in
practice
as
the
sun
itself
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
with
the
constant
effect
of
the
internal
heat
on
its
oceans
and
atmosphere
jupiter
could
get
along
with
a
good
deal
less
solar
heat
than
it
receives
in
proof
of
which
i
expect
to
find
the
poles
themselves
quite
comfortable
the
reason
the
internal
heat
is
so
little
taken
into
account
on
earth
is
because
from
the
thickness
of
the
crust
it
can
not
make
itself
felt
for
if
the
earth
were
as
chilled
through
as
ice
the
people
on
the
surface
would
not
feel
the
difference
a
jovian
week
explorations
disclosed
the
fact
that
though
the
island
general
outlines
were
fairly
regular
it
had
harbours
great
rivers
and
gulfs
and
bays
some
of
which
penetrated
many
hundred
miles
into
the
interior
it
also
showed
that
the
island
length
was
about
six
thousand
miles
and
its
breadth
about
three
thousand
and
that
it
had
therefore
about
the
superficial
area
of
asia
they
found
no
trace
of
the
great
monsters
that
had
been
so
numerous
on
the
mainland
though
there
were
plenty
of
smaller
and
creatures
among
them
animals
whose
build
was
much
like
that
of
the
prehistoric
horse
with
undeveloped
toes
on
each
side
of
the
hoof
which
in
the
modern
terrestrial
horse
have
disappeared
the
hoof
being
in
reality
but
a
middle
finger
it
is
wonderful
said
bearwarden
how
comparatively
narrow
a
body
of
water
can
keep
different
species
entirely
separate
the
island
of
sumatra
for
instance
is
inhabited
by
marsupials
belonging
to
the
distinct
australian
type
in
which
the
female
as
in
the
kangaroo
carries
the
slightly
developed
young
in
a
pouch
while
the
malay
peninsula
joined
to
the
mainland
has
all
the
highly
developed
animals
of
asia
and
the
connected
land
of
the
eastern
hemisphere
the
narrow
malacca
strait
being
all
that
has
kept
marsupials
and
mammals
apart
though
the
separating
power
has
been
increased
by
the
rapid
current
setting
through
this
has
decreased
the
chance
of
creatures
carried
to
sea
on
or
uprooted
trees
getting
safely
over
to
such
a
degree
that
apparently
none
have
survived
for
had
they
done
so
we
may
be
certain
that
the
mammals
with
the
advantage
their
young
have
over
the
marsupials
would
soon
have
run
them
out
the
marsupials
being
the
older
and
the
less
perfect
form
of
life
of
the
two
before
leaving
the
beautiful
region
beneath
them
cortlandt
proposed
that
it
be
named
after
their
host
which
bearwarden
seconded
whereupon
they
entered
it
as
ayrault
island
on
the
charts
after
this
they
rose
to
a
great
height
and
flew
swiftly
over
three
thousand
miles
of
ocean
till
they
came
to
another
island
not
quite
as
large
as
the
first
it
was
four
thousand
five
hundred
miles
long
by
something
less
than
three
thousand
wide
and
was
therefore
about
the
size
of
africa
it
had
several
high
ranges
of
mountains
and
a
number
of
great
rivers
and
fine
harbours
while
murmuring
bubbling
brooks
flowed
through
its
forest
glades
there
were
active
volcanoes
along
the
northern
coast
and
the
blue
crimson
and
purple
lines
in
the
luxuriant
foliage
were
the
most
beautiful
they
had
ever
seen
i
propose
said
bearwarden
that
we
christen
this
sylvialand
this
cortlandt
immediately
seconded
and
it
was
so
entered
on
the
charts
these
two
islands
said
bearwarden
may
become
the
centres
of
civilization
with
flying
machines
and
cables
to
carry
passengers
and
information
and
ships
of
great
displacement
for
the
interchange
of
commodities
there
is
no
limit
to
their
possible
development
the
absence
of
large
waves
will
also
be
very
favourable
to
which
will
be
able
to
run
at
tremendous
speeds
the
constancy
in
the
eruptions
of
the
volcanoes
will
offer
a
great
field
to
jovian
inventors
who
will
unquestionably
be
able
to
utilize
their
heat
for
the
production
of
steam
or
electricity
to
say
nothing
of
an
inexhaustible
supply
of
valuable
chemicals
they
may
contain
the
means
of
producing
some
force
entirely
different
from
apergy
and
as
superior
to
electricity
as
that
is
to
steam
our
earthly
volcanoes
have
been
put
to
slight
account
because
of
the
long
intervals
between
eruptions
after
leaving
sylvialand
they
went
westward
to
the
eastern
of
the
two
crescent
continents
it
was
separated
from
the
island
by
about
six
thousand
miles
of
ocean
and
had
less
width
than
the
western
having
about
the
proportions
of
a
crescent
while
the
western
had
the
shape
of
the
moon
when
four
or
five
days
old
they
found
the
height
of
the
mountains
and
plateaus
somewhat
less
than
on
the
eastern
continent
but
no
great
difference
in
other
respects
except
that
as
they
went
towards
the
pole
the
vegetation
became
more
like
that
of
scotland
or
a
north
temperate
region
than
any
they
had
seen
on
reaching
latitude
fifty
they
again
came
out
over
the
ocean
to
investigate
the
speckled
condition
they
had
observed
there
they
found
a
vast
archipelago
covering
as
great
an
area
as
the
whole
pacific
ocean
the
islands
varied
from
the
size
of
borneo
and
madagascar
to
that
of
sicily
and
corsica
while
some
contained
but
a
few
square
miles
the
surface
of
the
archipelago
was
about
equally
divided
between
land
and
water
it
would
take
good
navigation
or
an
elaborate
system
of
said
bearwarden
for
a
captain
to
find
the
shortest
course
through
these
groups
the
islands
were
covered
with
shade
trees
much
resembling
those
on
earth
and
the
leaves
on
many
were
turning
yellow
and
red
for
this
hemisphere
autumn
had
already
begun
the
jovian
trees
said
cortlandt
can
never
cease
to
bear
though
the
change
of
seasons
is
evidently
able
to
turn
their
colour
perhaps
by
merely
ripening
them
when
a
ripe
leaf
falls
off
its
place
is
doubtless
soon
taken
by
a
bud
for
germination
and
fructification
go
on
side
by
side
before
leaving
they
decided
to
name
this
twentieth
century
archipelago
since
so
much
of
the
knowledge
appertaining
to
it
had
been
acquired
in
their
own
day
at
latitude
sixty
the
northern
arms
of
the
two
continents
came
within
fifteen
hundred
miles
of
each
other
the
eastern
extension
was
split
like
the
tail
of
a
fish
the
great
bay
formed
thereby
being
filled
with
islands
which
also
extended
about
half
of
the
distance
across
the
western
extremity
shelved
very
gradually
the
running
out
for
miles
just
below
the
surface
of
the
water
after
this
the
travellers
flew
northward
at
great
speed
in
the
upper
regions
of
the
air
for
they
were
anxious
to
hasten
their
journey
they
found
nothing
but
unbroken
sea
and
not
till
they
reached
latitude
was
there
a
sign
of
ice
they
then
saw
some
small
bergs
and
field
ice
but
in
no
great
quantities
as
their
outside
thermometer
when
just
above
the
placid
water
for
there
were
no
waves
here
registered
one
degrees
fahrenheit
they
accounted
for
this
scarcity
of
ice
by
the
absence
of
land
on
which
fresh
water
could
freeze
and
by
the
fact
that
it
was
not
cold
enough
to
congeal
the
very
salt
finally
they
reached
another
archipelago
a
few
hundred
miles
in
extent
the
larger
islands
of
which
were
covered
with
a
sheet
of
ice
at
the
edges
of
which
small
icebergs
were
being
formed
by
breaking
off
and
slowly
floating
finding
a
small
island
on
which
the
coating
was
thin
they
grounded
the
callisto
and
stepped
out
for
the
first
time
in
several
days
the
air
was
so
still
that
a
small
piece
of
paper
released
at
a
height
of
six
feet
sank
slowly
and
went
as
straight
as
the
string
of
a
the
sun
was
bisected
by
the
line
of
the
horizon
and
appeared
to
be
moving
about
them
in
a
circle
with
only
its
upper
half
visible
as
jupiter
northern
hemisphere
was
passing
through
its
autumnal
equinox
they
concluded
they
had
landed
exactly
at
the
pole
now
to
work
on
our
experiment
said
cortlandt
i
wonder
how
we
may
best
get
below
the
frozen
surface
we
can
explode
a
small
quantity
of
dynamite
replied
bearwarden
after
which
the
digging
will
be
comparatively
easy
while
cortlandt
and
bearwarden
prepared
the
mine
ayrault
brought
out
a
pickaxe
two
shovels
and
the
battery
and
wires
with
which
to
ignite
the
explosive
they
made
their
preparations
within
one
hundred
feet
of
the
callisto
or
much
nearer
than
an
equivalent
amount
of
gunpowder
could
have
been
discharged
this
recalls
an
old
laboratory
experiment
or
rather
lecture
said
cortlandt
as
they
completed
the
arrangements
for
the
illustration
is
not
as
a
rule
carried
out
explode
two
pounds
of
powder
on
an
iron
safe
in
a
room
with
the
windows
closed
and
the
windows
will
be
blown
out
while
the
safe
remains
uninjured
explode
an
equivalent
amount
of
dynamite
on
top
of
the
safe
and
it
will
be
destroyed
while
the
glass
panes
are
not
even
cracked
this
illustrates
the
difference
in
rapidity
with
which
the
explosions
take
place
to
the
intensely
rapid
action
of
dynamite
the
air
affords
as
much
resistance
as
a
solid
substance
while
the
explosion
of
the
powder
is
so
slow
that
the
air
has
time
to
move
away
hence
the
destruction
of
the
windows
in
the
first
case
and
the
safe
in
the
second
when
they
had
moved
beyond
the
danger
line
bearwarden
as
the
party
practising
engineer
pressed
the
button
and
the
explosion
did
the
rest
they
found
that
the
ground
was
frozen
to
a
depth
of
but
little
more
than
a
foot
below
which
it
became
perceptibly
warm
plying
their
shovels
vigorously
they
had
soon
dug
the
hole
so
deep
that
its
edges
were
above
their
heads
when
the
floor
was
ten
feet
below
the
surrounding
level
the
thermometer
registered
sixty
this
is
scarcely
a
fair
test
said
cortlandt
since
the
heat
rises
and
is
lost
as
fast
as
given
off
let
us
therefore
close
the
opening
and
see
in
what
time
it
will
melt
a
number
of
cubic
feet
of
ice
accordingly
they
climbed
out
threw
in
about
a
of
ice
and
covered
the
opening
with
two
of
the
callisto
thick
rugs
in
half
an
hour
all
the
ice
had
melted
and
in
another
half
hour
the
water
was
hot
no
arctic
expedition
need
freeze
to
death
here
said
bearwarden
since
all
a
man
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
burrow
a
few
feet
to
be
as
warm
as
toast
as
the
island
on
which
they
had
landed
was
at
one
side
of
the
archipelago
but
was
itself
at
the
exact
pole
it
followed
that
the
centre
of
the
archipelago
was
not
the
part
farthest
north
this
in
a
measure
accounted
for
the
slight
thickness
of
ice
and
snow
for
the
isobaric
lines
would
slope
and
consequently
what
wind
there
was
would
flow
towards
the
interior
of
the
archipelago
whose
surface
was
colder
than
the
surrounding
ocean
the
moist
air
however
coming
almost
entirely
from
the
south
would
lose
most
of
its
moisture
by
condensation
in
passing
over
the
land
and
so
like
the
clouds
over
the
region
east
of
the
andes
would
have
but
little
left
to
let
fall
on
this
extreme
northern
part
the
blanketing
effect
of
a
great
thickness
of
snow
would
also
cause
the
lower
strata
of
ice
to
melt
by
keeping
in
the
heat
constantly
given
off
by
the
warm
planet
i
think
there
can
be
no
question
said
cortlandt
that
as
a
result
of
jupiter
great
flattening
at
the
poles
and
the
drawing
of
the
crust
which
moves
faster
in
jupiter
rotation
than
any
other
part
towards
the
equator
the
crust
must
be
particularly
thin
here
for
were
it
as
thin
all
over
there
would
be
no
space
for
the
which
judging
from
the
purity
of
the
atmosphere
must
be
very
extensive
further
we
can
recall
that
the
water
in
the
hot
spring
near
which
we
alighted
which
evidently
came
from
a
far
greater
depth
than
we
have
here
was
not
as
hot
as
this
the
conclusion
is
clear
that
elsewhere
the
internal
heat
is
not
as
near
the
surface
as
here
the
more
i
see
of
jupiter
exclaimed
bearwarden
enthusiastically
the
more
charmed
i
become
it
almost
exactly
supplies
what
i
have
been
conjuring
up
as
my
idea
of
a
perfect
planet
its
compensations
of
high
land
near
the
equator
and
low
with
effective
internal
heat
at
the
poles
are
ideal
the
gradual
slope
of
its
continental
elevations
on
account
of
their
extent
will
ease
the
work
of
operating
railways
and
the
density
will
be
just
the
thing
for
our
flying
machines
while
nature
has
supplied
all
sources
of
power
so
lavishly
that
no
undertaking
will
be
too
great
though
land
as
yet
to
judge
by
our
photographs
occupies
only
about
one
eighth
of
the
surface
we
know
from
the
experience
of
the
other
planets
that
this
is
bound
to
increase
so
that
if
the
human
race
can
perpetuate
itself
on
jupiter
long
enough
it
will
undoubtedly
have
one
fourth
or
a
larger
proportion
for
occupation
though
the
land
already
upheaved
comprises
fully
forty
times
the
area
of
our
entire
globe
which
as
we
know
is
still
water
since
we
have
reached
what
we
might
call
the
end
of
jupiter
and
still
have
time
continued
ayrault
let
us
proceed
to
saturn
where
we
may
find
even
stranger
things
than
here
i
hoped
we
could
investigate
the
great
red
spot
but
am
convinced
we
have
seen
the
beginning
of
one
in
twentieth
century
archipelago
and
what
under
favourable
conditions
will
be
recognized
as
such
on
earth
it
was
just
six
terrestrial
weeks
since
they
had
set
out
and
therefore
february
on
earth
it
would
be
best
in
any
case
to
start
from
jupiter
equator
said
cortlandt
for
the
straight
line
we
should
make
from
the
surface
here
would
be
at
right
angles
to
saturn
we
shall
probably
in
spite
of
ourselves
swing
a
few
degrees
beyond
the
line
and
so
can
get
a
view
of
some
portion
of
the
southern
hemisphere
all
aboard
for
saturn
cried
bearwarden
enthusiastically
in
his
jovial
way
this
will
be
a
journey
chapter
xiv
the
scene
shifts
having
returned
the
rugs
to
the
callisto
they
applied
the
maximum
power
of
the
batteries
to
rising
closed
all
openings
when
the
barometer
registered
thirty
and
moved
off
into
space
when
several
thousand
miles
above
the
pole
they
diverted
part
of
the
power
to
attracting
the
nearest
moon
that
was
in
the
plane
of
jupiter
equator
and
by
the
time
their
upward
motion
had
ceased
were
moving
well
in
its
direction
their
rapid
motion
aided
the
work
of
resisting
gravity
since
their
car
had
in
fact
become
a
small
moon
revolving
like
those
of
uranus
or
that
of
neptune
in
an
orbit
varying
greatly
from
the
plane
of
the
ecliptic
as
they
flew
south
at
a
height
ranging
from
two
thousand
to
three
thousand
miles
the
planet
revolved
before
them
and
they
had
a
chance
of
obtaining
a
thorough
view
there
were
but
a
few
scattered
islands
on
the
side
of
the
northern
hemisphere
opposite
to
that
over
which
they
had
reached
the
pole
and
in
the
varying
colours
of
the
water
which
they
attributed
to
temperature
or
to
some
substance
in
solution
they
recognized
what
they
had
always
heard
described
on
earth
as
the
bands
of
jupiter
encircling
the
planet
with
great
belts
the
colour
varying
with
the
latitude
at
about
latitude
these
bands
were
purple
farther
south
light
olive
green
and
at
the
equator
a
brown
orange
shortly
after
they
swung
across
the
equator
the
ocean
again
became
purple
and
at
the
same
time
a
and
very
brilliant
white
spot
came
into
view
its
brightness
showed
slight
variations
in
intensity
though
its
general
shape
remained
unchanged
it
had
another
peculiarity
in
that
it
possessed
a
fairly
rapid
motion
of
its
own
as
it
moved
eastward
across
the
surface
of
the
ocean
it
exhibited
all
the
phenomena
of
the
storm
they
had
watched
in
crossing
secretary
deepwaters
bay
but
covered
a
larger
area
and
was
far
more
violent
their
glasses
showed
them
vast
sheets
of
spray
driven
along
at
tremendous
speed
while
the
surface
was
milky
white
this
said
bearwarden
picking
up
a
book
solves
to
my
mind
the
mystery
of
the
white
spot
described
by
the
english
writer
chambers
in
as
follows
the
last
few
years
a
brilliant
white
spot
has
been
visible
on
the
equatorial
border
of
the
great
southern
belt
a
curious
fact
in
connection
with
this
spot
is
that
it
moves
with
a
velocity
of
some
two
hundred
and
sixty
miles
per
hour
greater
than
the
red
spot
denning
obtained
one
hundred
and
observations
of
this
bright
marking
during
the
years
and
determined
the
period
as
nine
hours
fifty
minutes
eight
and
seven
tenths
seconds
five
and
a
half
minutes
less
than
that
of
the
red
spot
although
the
latter
is
now
somewhat
faint
the
white
spot
gives
promise
of
remaining
visible
for
many
years
during
the
year
a
large
number
of
observations
of
jupiter
were
made
at
the
dearborn
observatory
chicago
by
hough
using
the
refractor
of
the
observatory
inasmuch
as
these
observations
are
not
only
of
high
intrinsic
interest
but
are
in
conflict
to
some
extent
with
previous
records
a
somewhat
full
abstract
of
them
will
be
useful
the
object
of
general
interest
was
the
great
red
spot
the
outline
shape
and
size
of
this
remarkable
object
has
remained
without
material
change
from
the
year
when
it
was
first
observed
here
until
the
present
time
according
to
our
observations
during
the
whole
of
this
period
it
has
shown
a
sharp
and
outline
and
at
no
time
has
it
coalesced
or
been
joined
to
any
belt
in
its
proximity
as
has
been
alleged
by
some
observers
during
the
year
the
middle
of
the
spot
was
very
much
paler
in
colour
than
the
margins
causing
it
to
appear
as
an
elliptical
ring
the
ring
form
has
continued
up
to
the
present
time
while
the
outline
of
the
spot
has
remained
very
constant
the
colour
has
changed
materially
from
year
to
year
during
the
past
three
years
it
has
at
times
been
very
faint
so
as
barely
to
be
visible
the
persistence
of
this
object
for
so
many
years
leads
me
to
infer
that
the
formerly
accepted
theory
that
the
phenomena
seen
on
the
surface
of
the
planet
are
atmospheric
is
no
longer
tenable
the
statement
so
often
made
in
that
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
or
months
the
whole
aspect
of
the
planet
may
be
changed
is
obviously
erroneous
the
oval
white
spots
on
the
southern
hemisphere
of
the
planet
nine
degrees
south
of
the
equator
have
been
systematically
observed
at
every
opposition
during
the
past
eight
years
they
are
generally
found
in
groups
of
three
or
more
but
are
rather
difficult
to
observe
the
rotation
period
deduced
from
them
is
nearly
the
same
as
from
the
great
red
spot
these
spots
usually
have
a
slow
drift
in
longitude
of
about
five
seconds
daily
in
the
direction
of
the
planet
rotation
when
referred
to
the
great
red
spot
corresponding
to
a
rotation
period
of
twenty
seconds
less
than
the
latter
this
shows
continued
bearwarden
that
as
long
ago
as
towards
the
close
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
old
idea
that
we
saw
nothing
but
the
clouds
in
jupiter
atmosphere
was
beginning
to
change
and
also
how
closely
the
two
english
writers
and
hough
were
studying
the
subject
though
their
views
did
not
entirely
agree
a
white
spot
is
merely
a
passing
round
and
round
the
planet
the
wind
running
a
little
ahead
of
the
surface
which
accounts
for
its
rapid
rotation
compared
with
the
red
spot
which
is
a
fixture
a
critic
may
say
we
have
no
such
winds
on
earth
to
which
i
reply
that
winds
on
a
planet
of
jupiter
size
with
its
rate
of
rotation
though
it
is
miles
from
the
sun
and
the
internal
heat
is
so
near
the
surface
and
with
land
and
water
arranged
as
they
are
may
and
indeed
must
be
very
different
from
those
prevailing
on
earth
the
conditions
producing
and
affecting
them
being
so
changed
though
the
moves
two
hundred
and
sixty
miles
an
hour
the
wind
need
not
blow
at
that
rate
later
they
saw
several
smaller
spots
drifting
eastward
but
concluded
that
any
seaworthy
ship
might
pass
safely
through
them
for
though
they
were
hurricanes
of
great
violence
the
waves
were
small
there
would
be
less
danger
said
bearwarden
of
shipping
seas
here
than
there
is
on
earth
the
principal
risk
to
travellers
would
be
that
of
being
blown
from
the
deck
on
account
of
the
air
weight
in
connection
with
its
velocity
this
would
necessitate
some
precaution
the
next
object
of
interest
was
the
great
red
spot
it
proved
as
cortlandt
had
predicted
to
be
a
continent
with
at
that
time
no
special
colour
though
they
easily
recognized
it
by
comparing
its
outlines
with
those
of
the
spot
in
the
map
its
length
as
they
already
knew
was
thousand
miles
and
its
breadth
about
eight
thousand
miles
so
that
it
contained
more
square
miles
than
the
entire
surface
of
the
earth
land
and
water
included
it
is
clear
said
cortlandt
that
at
some
season
of
long
year
a
change
takes
place
that
affects
the
colour
of
the
leaves
some
drought
or
prolonged
norther
for
it
is
obvious
that
that
is
the
simplest
explanation
in
like
manner
we
may
expect
that
at
some
times
more
white
spots
will
move
across
the
ocean
than
at
others
on
account
of
the
size
of
these
continents
and
oceans
said
bearwarden
it
is
easy
to
believe
that
many
climatic
conditions
may
prevail
here
that
can
scarcely
exist
on
earth
but
what
a
magnificent
world
to
develop
with
its
great
rivers
lakes
and
mountains
showing
at
even
this
distance
and
what
natural
resources
must
be
lying
there
dormant
awaiting
our
call
this
constantly
recurs
to
my
mind
the
subjugation
and
thorough
opening
up
of
this
red
spot
continent
will
probably
supply
more
interesting
problems
than
straightening
the
axis
of
the
earth
at
our
next
visit
replied
ayrault
when
we
have
established
regular
interplanetary
lines
of
travel
we
may
have
an
opportunity
to
examine
it
more
closely
then
they
again
attracted
the
nearest
moon
beyond
which
they
had
swung
increased
the
repulsion
on
jupiter
and
soared
away
towards
saturn
we
have
a
striking
illustration
of
jupiter
enormous
mass
said
cortlandt
as
the
apparent
diameter
of
the
mighty
planet
rapidly
decreased
in
the
fact
that
notwithstanding
its
numerous
moons
it
still
rotates
so
rapidly
we
know
that
the
days
were
formerly
but
half
or
a
quarter
as
long
as
now
having
lasted
but
six
or
eight
hours
the
explanation
of
the
elongation
is
simple
the
earth
rotates
in
about
hours
while
the
moon
encircles
it
but
once
in
nearly
eight
days
so
that
our
satellite
is
continually
drawing
the
oceans
backward
against
its
motion
these
tidal
brakes
acting
through
the
friction
of
the
water
on
the
bottom
its
unequal
pressure
and
the
impact
of
the
waves
on
the
shore
are
continually
retarding
its
rotation
so
that
the
day
is
a
fraction
of
a
second
longer
now
than
it
was
in
the
time
of
caesar
this
same
action
is
of
course
taking
place
in
jupiter
and
the
great
planets
in
this
case
there
being
five
moons
at
work
our
moon
we
know
rotates
on
its
axis
but
once
while
it
revolves
about
the
earth
this
being
no
doubt
due
to
its
own
comparative
smallness
and
the
great
attraction
of
the
earth
which
must
have
produced
tremendous
tides
before
the
lunar
oceans
disappeared
from
its
surface
in
crossing
the
orbits
of
the
satellites
they
passed
near
ganymede
jupiter
largest
moon
this
said
cortlandt
was
discovered
by
galileo
in
it
is
three
thousand
four
hundred
and
eighty
miles
in
diameter
while
our
moon
is
but
two
thousand
one
hundred
and
sixty
revolves
at
a
distance
of
six
hundred
and
thousand
three
hundred
miles
from
jupiter
completes
its
revolution
in
seven
days
and
four
hours
and
has
a
specific
gravity
of
in
passing
they
observed
that
ganymede
possessed
an
atmosphere
and
continents
and
oceans
of
large
area
here
said
bearwarden
we
have
a
body
with
a
diameter
about
five
hundred
miles
greater
than
the
planet
mercury
its
size
light
specific
gravity
atmosphere
and
oceans
seem
to
indicate
that
it
is
less
advanced
than
that
planet
yet
you
think
jupiter
has
had
a
longer
separate
existence
than
the
planets
nearer
the
sun
undoubtedly
said
cortlandt
jupiter
was
condensed
while
in
the
nebula
and
began
its
individual
existence
and
its
evolutionary
career
long
before
mercury
was
formed
the
matter
now
in
ganymede
however
doubtless
remained
part
of
the
nebula
till
after
mercury
creation
and
being
part
of
so
great
a
mass
did
not
cool
very
rapidly
i
should
say
that
this
satellite
has
about
the
same
relation
to
jupiter
that
jupiter
has
to
the
sun
and
is
therefore
younger
in
point
of
time
as
well
as
of
development
than
the
most
distant
callisto
and
older
at
all
events
in
years
than
europa
and
io
both
of
which
are
nearer
this
supposition
is
corroborated
by
the
fact
that
europa
the
smallest
of
these
four
is
also
the
densest
having
a
specific
gravity
of
its
smallness
having
enabled
it
to
overtake
ganymede
in
development
notwithstanding
the
start
in
the
face
of
the
evidence
before
us
we
must
believe
this
or
else
that
perhaps
as
in
the
case
of
the
asteroid
hilda
something
like
a
collision
has
rejuvenated
it
this
might
account
for
its
size
and
for
the
nautical
almanac
statement
that
there
is
a
and
variable
inclination
to
its
orbit
while
io
and
europa
revolve
exactly
in
the
plane
of
equator
they
had
about
as
long
a
journey
before
them
as
they
had
already
made
in
going
from
the
earth
to
jupiter
the
great
planet
soon
appeared
as
a
huge
crescent
since
it
was
between
them
and
the
sun
its
moons
became
as
and
stars
and
in
the
evening
of
the
next
day
jupiter
disk
became
invisible
to
the
unaided
eye
since
there
were
no
way
stations
in
the
shape
of
planets
or
asteroids
between
jupiter
and
saturn
they
kept
the
maximum
repulsion
on
jupiter
as
long
as
possible
and
moved
at
tremendous
speed
saturn
was
somewhat
in
advance
of
jupiter
in
its
orbit
so
that
their
course
from
the
earth
had
been
along
two
sides
of
a
triangle
with
an
obtuse
angle
between
during
the
next
four
terrestrial
days
they
sighted
several
small
comets
but
spent
most
of
their
time
writing
out
their
jovian
experiences
during
the
sixth
day
saturn
rings
although
not
as
much
tilted
as
they
would
be
later
in
the
planet
season
presented
a
most
superb
sight
while
they
spun
in
the
sun
rays
soon
after
this
the
eight
moons
became
visible
and
while
slightly
reducing
the
callisto
speed
they
crossed
the
orbits
of
iapetus
hyperion
and
titan
when
they
knew
they
were
but
seven
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
miles
from
saturn
i
am
anxious
to
ascertain
said
cortlandt
whether
the
composition
of
yonder
rings
is
similar
to
that
of
the
comet
through
which
we
passed
i
am
sure
they
shine
with
more
than
reflected
light
we
have
been
in
the
habit
said
ayrault
of
associating
heat
with
light
but
it
is
obvious
there
is
something
far
more
subtle
about
cometary
light
and
that
of
saturn
rings
both
of
which
seem
to
have
their
birth
in
the
intense
cold
of
interplanetary
space
passing
close
to
mimas
saturn
nearest
moon
they
supplemented
its
attraction
after
swinging
by
by
their
own
strong
pull
bringing
their
speed
down
to
dead
slow
as
they
entered
the
outside
ring
at
distances
often
of
half
a
mile
they
found
meteoric
masses
sometimes
lumps
the
size
of
a
house
often
no
larger
than
apples
while
small
particles
like
grains
of
sand
moved
between
them
there
were
two
motions
the
ring
revolved
about
saturn
and
the
particles
vibrated
among
themselves
evidently
kept
apart
by
a
mutual
repulsion
which
seemed
both
to
increase
and
decrease
faster
than
gravitation
for
on
approaching
one
another
they
were
more
strongly
repelled
than
attracted
but
when
they
separated
the
repulsion
decreased
faster
than
the
attraction
so
that
after
a
time
divergence
ceased
and
they
remained
at
fixed
distances
the
callisto
soon
became
imbued
with
motion
also
but
nothing
ever
struck
it
when
any
large
mass
came
unusually
near
both
it
and
their
car
emitted
light
and
they
rapidly
separated
the
sunlight
was
not
as
strong
here
as
it
had
been
when
they
entered
the
comet
and
as
they
penetrated
farther
they
were
better
able
to
observe
the
omnipresent
luminosity
they
were
somewhat
puzzled
by
the
approach
of
certain
which
seemed
to
contain
nothing
but
this
concentrated
brightness
occasionally
one
of
these
centres
would
glow
very
brightly
near
them
and
simultaneously
recede
at
such
times
the
callisto
also
glowed
and
itself
recoiled
slightly
at
first
the
travellers
could
not
account
for
this
but
finally
they
concluded
that
the
centres
must
be
meteoric
masses
consisting
entirely
of
gases
possessing
weight
though
invisible
we
have
again
to
face
said
cortlandt
that
singular
law
that
till
recently
we
did
not
suppose
existed
on
earth
all
kinds
of
suppositions
have
been
advanced
in
explanation
of
these
rings
some
writers
have
their
thickness
looked
at
from
the
thin
edge
as
four
hundred
miles
some
one
hundred
and
some
but
forty
one
astronomer
of
the
nineteenth
century
a
man
of
considerable
eminence
was
convinced
that
they
consisted
of
sheets
of
liquid
now
it
should
be
obvious
that
no
liquid
could
maintain
itself
here
for
a
minute
for
it
would
either
fall
upon
the
planet
as
a
crushing
hail
or
if
dependent
for
its
shape
on
its
own
tenacity
it
would
break
if
formed
of
the
toughest
steel
on
account
of
the
tremendous
weight
any
number
of
theories
have
been
advanced
by
any
number
of
men
but
in
weight
we
have
the
rub
no
one
has
ever
shown
how
these
innumerable
fragments
maintain
themselves
at
a
height
of
but
a
few
thousand
miles
above
saturn
withstanding
the
giant
their
rate
of
revolution
though
rapid
does
not
seem
fast
enough
to
sustain
them
neither
have
i
ever
seen
it
explained
why
the
small
fragments
do
not
fall
upon
the
large
ones
though
many
astronomers
have
pictured
the
composition
of
these
rings
as
we
find
they
exist
nor
do
we
know
why
the
molecules
of
a
gas
are
driven
farther
apart
by
heat
while
their
activity
is
also
increased
though
if
this
activity
were
revolution
about
one
another
to
develop
the
centrifugal
it
would
not
need
to
be
as
strong
then
as
when
they
are
cold
and
nearer
together
there
may
be
explanations
but
i
have
found
none
in
any
of
the
literature
i
have
read
it
seems
to
me
that
all
this
leads
to
but
one
conclusion
viz
apergy
is
the
constant
and
visible
companion
of
gravitation
on
these
great
planets
jupiter
and
saturn
perhaps
on
account
of
some
peculiar
influence
they
possess
and
also
in
comets
in
the
case
of
large
masses
while
on
earth
it
appears
naturally
only
among
molecules
those
of
gases
and
every
other
substance
i
should
go
a
step
further
said
bearwarden
and
say
our
earth
has
the
peculiarity
since
it
does
not
possess
the
influence
necessary
to
generate
naturally
a
great
or
even
considerable
development
of
apergy
the
electricity
of
thunderstorms
northern
lights
and
other
forces
seems
to
be
produced
freely
but
as
regards
apergy
our
planet
natural
productiveness
appears
to
be
small
the
omnipresent
luminosity
continued
but
the
glow
was
scarcely
bright
enough
to
be
perceived
from
the
earth
i
believe
however
said
bearwarden
referring
to
this
that
whenever
a
satellite
passes
near
these
fragments
preferably
when
it
enters
the
planet
shadow
since
that
will
remove
its
own
light
it
will
create
such
activity
among
them
as
to
make
the
luminosity
visible
to
the
large
telescopes
or
gelatine
plates
on
earth
now
said
ayrault
that
we
have
evolved
enough
theories
to
keep
astronomers
busy
for
some
time
if
they
attempt
to
discuss
them
i
suggest
that
we
alight
and
leave
the
abstract
for
the
concrete
whereupon
they
passed
through
the
inner
ring
and
rapidly
sank
to
the
ground
book
iii
chapter
saturn
landing
on
a
place
about
ten
degrees
north
of
the
equator
so
that
they
might
obtain
a
good
view
of
the
great
rings
since
on
the
line
only
the
thin
edge
would
be
visible
they
opened
a
with
the
same
caution
they
had
exercised
on
jupiter
again
there
was
a
rush
of
air
showing
that
the
pressure
without
was
greater
than
that
within
but
on
this
occasion
the
barometer
stopped
at
from
which
they
calculated
that
the
pressure
was
nineteen
pounds
to
the
square
inch
on
their
bodies
instead
of
fifteen
as
at
on
earth
this
difference
was
so
slight
that
they
scarcely
felt
it
they
also
discarded
the
apergetic
outfits
that
had
been
so
useful
on
jupiter
as
unnecessary
here
the
air
was
an
icy
blast
and
though
they
quickly
closed
the
opening
the
interior
of
the
callisto
was
considerably
chilled
we
shall
want
our
winter
clothes
said
bearwarden
it
might
be
more
comfortable
for
us
exactly
on
the
equator
though
the
scene
at
night
will
be
far
finer
here
if
we
can
stand
the
climate
doubtless
it
will
also
be
warmer
soon
for
the
sun
has
but
just
risen
i
suspect
this
is
merely
one
of
the
cold
waves
that
rush
towards
the
equator
at
this
season
which
corresponds
to
about
the
of
our
september
replied
cortlandt
the
poles
of
saturn
must
be
intensely
cold
during
its
long
winter
of
fourteen
and
three
quarter
years
for
the
axis
being
inclined
degrees
from
the
perpendicular
of
its
orbit
the
pole
turned
from
the
sun
is
more
shut
off
from
its
heat
than
ours
and
in
addition
to
this
the
mean
distance
more
than
eight
hundred
and
eighty
million
miles
is
very
great
since
the
chemical
composition
of
the
air
we
have
inhaled
has
not
troubled
our
lungs
it
is
fair
to
suppose
we
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
breathing
having
dressed
themselves
more
warmly
and
seen
by
a
thermometer
they
had
placed
outside
that
the
temperature
was
degrees
fahrenheit
which
had
seemed
very
cold
compared
with
the
warmth
inside
the
callisto
they
again
opened
the
this
time
leaving
it
open
longer
what
they
had
felt
before
was
evidently
merely
a
sudden
gust
for
the
air
was
now
comparatively
calm
finding
that
the
doctor
prediction
as
to
the
suitability
of
the
air
to
their
lungs
was
correct
they
ventured
out
closing
the
door
as
they
went
expecting
as
on
jupiter
to
find
principally
vertebrates
of
the
reptile
and
bird
order
they
carried
guns
and
cartridges
loaded
with
buckshot
and
no
trusting
for
projectiles
to
their
revolvers
which
they
shoved
into
their
belts
they
also
took
tubes
for
experiments
on
the
saturnian
bacilli
hanging
a
bucket
under
the
pipe
leading
from
the
roof
to
catch
any
rain
that
might
fall
for
they
remembered
the
scarcity
of
on
jupiter
they
set
out
in
a
southwesterly
direction
walking
along
they
noticed
on
all
sides
tall
lilies
immaculately
pure
in
their
whiteness
and
mushrooms
and
toadstools
nearly
a
foot
high
the
former
having
a
delicious
flavour
and
extreme
freshness
as
though
only
an
hour
old
they
had
seen
no
animal
life
or
even
sign
of
it
and
were
wondering
at
its
dearth
when
suddenly
two
large
white
birds
rose
directly
in
front
of
them
like
thought
bearwarden
and
ayrault
had
their
guns
up
snapping
the
over
safe
and
pulling
the
triggers
almost
simultaneously
bearwarden
having
double
buckshot
killed
his
bird
at
the
first
fire
but
ayrault
having
only
no
had
to
give
his
the
second
barrel
almost
all
damage
in
both
cases
being
in
the
head
on
coming
close
to
their
victims
they
found
them
to
measure
twelve
feet
from
tip
to
tip
and
to
have
a
tremendous
thickness
of
feathers
and
down
from
the
looks
of
these
beauties
said
bearwarden
i
should
say
they
probably
inhabited
a
pretty
cold
place
they
are
doubtless
northern
birds
said
cortlandt
that
have
just
come
south
it
is
easy
to
believe
that
the
depth
to
which
the
temperature
may
fall
in
the
upper
air
of
this
planet
must
be
something
startling
as
they
turned
from
the
cranes
to
which
species
the
birds
seemed
to
belong
they
became
mute
with
astonishment
every
mushroom
had
disappeared
but
the
toadstools
still
remained
is
it
possible
we
did
not
see
them
gasped
ayrault
we
must
inadvertently
have
walked
some
distance
since
we
saw
them
said
cortlandt
they
were
what
i
looked
forward
to
for
lunch
exclaimed
bearwarden
they
were
greatly
perplexed
the
mushrooms
were
all
about
them
when
they
shot
the
birds
which
still
lay
where
they
had
fallen
we
must
be
very
said
the
doctor
or
perchance
our
brains
are
affected
by
the
air
we
must
analyze
it
to
see
if
it
contains
our
own
proportion
of
oxygen
and
nitrogen
there
was
a
good
deal
of
gas
on
jupiter
but
that
would
hardly
confuse
our
senses
the
strange
thing
is
that
we
all
seem
to
have
been
impressed
the
same
way
concluding
that
they
must
have
been
mistaken
they
continued
on
their
journey
all
about
they
heard
a
curious
humming
as
that
of
bees
or
like
the
murmuring
of
prayers
in
a
resonant
cathedral
thinking
it
was
the
wind
in
the
great
trees
that
grew
singly
around
them
they
paid
no
attention
to
it
until
emerging
on
an
open
plain
and
finding
that
the
sound
continued
they
stopped
now
said
bearwarden
this
is
more
curious
than
anything
we
found
on
jupiter
here
we
have
an
incessant
and
rather
pleasant
sound
with
no
visible
cause
it
may
possibly
be
some
peculiarity
of
the
grass
replied
cortlandt
though
should
it
continue
when
we
reach
sandy
or
bare
soil
i
shall
believe
we
need
a
dose
of
quinine
i
feel
perfectly
well
said
ayrault
how
is
it
with
you
each
finding
that
he
was
in
a
normal
state
they
proceeded
determined
if
possible
to
discover
the
source
from
which
the
sounds
came
suddenly
bearwarden
raised
his
gun
to
bring
down
a
hawk
but
the
bird
flew
off
and
he
did
not
shoot
plague
the
luck
said
he
i
went
blind
just
as
i
was
about
to
pull
a
haze
seemed
to
cover
both
barrels
and
completely
screened
the
bird
the
callisto
will
soon
be
hidden
by
those
trees
said
cortlandt
i
think
we
had
better
take
our
bearings
for
if
our
crack
shot
is
going
to
miss
like
that
we
may
want
canned
provisions
accordingly
he
got
out
his
sextant
took
the
altitude
of
the
sun
got
and
a
few
angles
and
began
to
make
a
rough
calculation
for
several
minutes
he
worked
industriously
used
the
rubber
at
the
end
of
his
pencil
tried
again
and
then
scratched
out
that
humming
confuses
me
so
that
i
can
not
work
correctly
said
he
while
the
most
irrelevant
things
enter
my
mind
in
spite
of
me
and
mix
up
my
figures
i
found
the
same
thing
said
bearwarden
but
said
nothing
for
fear
i
should
not
be
believed
in
addition
to
going
blind
for
a
moment
i
almost
forgot
what
i
was
trying
to
do
changing
their
course
slightly
they
went
towards
a
range
of
hills
in
the
hope
of
finding
rocky
or
sandy
soil
in
order
to
test
the
sounds
and
ascertain
if
they
would
cease
or
vary
having
ascended
a
few
hundred
feet
they
sat
down
near
some
trees
to
rest
the
musical
hum
continuing
meanwhile
unchanged
the
ground
was
strewn
with
large
coloured
crystals
apparently
rubies
sapphires
and
emeralds
about
the
size
of
hens
eggs
and
also
large
sheets
of
isinglass
picking
up
one
of
the
latter
ayrault
examined
it
points
of
light
and
shade
kept
forming
on
its
surface
from
which
rings
radiated
like
the
circles
spreading
in
all
directions
from
a
place
in
still
water
at
which
a
pebble
is
thrown
he
called
his
companions
and
the
three
examined
it
the
isinglass
was
about
ten
inches
long
by
eight
across
and
contained
but
few
impurities
in
addition
to
the
spreading
rings
curious
forms
were
continually
taking
shape
and
dissolving
this
is
more
interesting
said
bearwarden
than
sounding
shells
at
the
we
must
make
a
note
of
it
as
another
thing
to
study
they
then
spread
their
handkerchiefs
on
a
mound
of
earth
so
as
to
make
a
table
and
began
examining
the
gems
does
it
not
seem
to
you
asked
ayrault
a
few
minutes
later
addressing
his
companions
as
though
we
were
not
alone
i
have
thought
many
times
there
was
some
one
or
perhaps
several
persons
here
besides
ourselves
the
same
idea
has
occurred
to
me
replied
cortlandt
i
was
convinced
a
moment
ago
that
a
shadow
crossed
the
page
on
which
i
was
taking
notes
can
it
be
there
are
objects
about
us
we
can
not
see
we
know
there
are
vibrations
of
both
light
and
sound
that
do
not
affect
our
senses
i
wish
we
had
brought
the
magnetic
eye
perchance
that
might
tell
us
anything
sufficiently
dense
to
cast
a
shadow
said
ayrault
should
be
seen
since
it
would
also
be
able
to
make
an
image
on
our
retinas
i
believe
any
impressions
we
are
receiving
are
produced
through
our
minds
as
if
some
one
were
thinking
very
intently
about
us
and
that
neither
the
magnetic
eye
nor
a
sensitive
plate
could
reveal
anything
they
then
returned
to
the
study
of
the
isinglass
which
they
were
able
to
split
into
extremely
thin
sheets
suddenly
a
cloud
passed
over
the
table
and
almost
immediately
disappeared
and
then
a
sharpened
pencil
with
which
ayrault
had
been
writing
began
to
trace
on
a
sheet
of
paper
in
an
even
hand
and
with
a
slight
frictional
sound
stop
said
bearwarden
let
us
each
for
himself
describe
in
writing
what
he
has
seen
in
a
moment
they
had
done
this
and
then
compared
notes
in
each
case
the
vision
was
the
same
then
they
looked
at
the
writing
made
by
the
invisible
hand
absorpta
est
mors
in
victoria
it
ran
gentlemen
began
bearwarden
as
if
addressing
a
meeting
this
can
not
be
coincidence
we
are
undoubtedly
and
unquestionably
in
the
presence
of
a
spirit
or
of
several
spirits
that
they
understand
latin
we
see
and
from
what
they
say
they
may
have
known
death
time
may
show
whether
they
have
been
terrestrials
like
ourselves
though
the
conditions
of
life
here
might
make
us
delirious
it
is
scarcely
possible
that
different
temperaments
like
ours
should
be
affected
in
so
precisely
the
same
way
besides
in
this
writing
we
have
tangible
proof
it
is
perfectly
reasonable
said
ayrault
to
conclude
it
was
a
spirit
if
we
may
assume
that
spirits
have
the
power
to
move
the
pencil
which
is
a
material
object
nobody
doubts
nowadays
that
after
death
we
live
again
that
being
the
case
we
must
admit
that
we
live
somewhere
space
as
i
take
it
can
be
no
obstacle
to
a
spirit
therefore
why
suppose
they
remain
on
earth
this
is
a
wonderful
place
said
cortlandt
we
have
already
seen
enough
to
convince
us
of
the
existence
of
many
unknown
laws
i
wish
the
spirit
would
reveal
itself
in
some
other
way
as
he
finished
speaking
the
rays
of
the
distant
and
sun
were
split
and
the
colours
of
the
spectrum
danced
upon
the
linen
cloth
as
if
obtained
by
a
prism
in
astonishment
they
rose
and
looked
closely
at
the
table
when
suddenly
a
shadow
that
no
one
recognized
as
his
own
appeared
upon
the
cover
tracing
it
to
its
source
their
eyes
met
those
of
an
old
man
with
a
white
robe
and
beard
and
a
look
of
great
intelligence
on
his
calm
face
they
knew
he
had
not
been
in
the
little
grove
thirty
seconds
before
and
as
this
was
surrounded
by
open
country
there
was
no
place
from
which
he
could
have
come
chapter
ii
the
spirit
first
visit
greetings
and
congratulations
he
said
man
has
steadfastly
striven
to
rise
and
we
see
the
results
in
you
i
have
always
believed
in
the
existence
of
spirits
said
cortlandt
but
never
expected
to
see
one
with
my
natural
eyes
and
you
never
will
in
its
spiritual
state
replied
the
shade
unless
you
supplement
sight
with
reason
a
spirit
has
merely
existence
entity
and
will
and
is
entirely
invisible
to
your
eyes
how
is
it
then
that
we
see
and
hear
you
asked
cortlandt
are
you
a
man
or
a
spectre
that
is
able
to
affect
our
senses
i
was
a
man
replied
the
spirit
and
i
have
given
myself
visible
and
tangible
form
to
warn
you
of
danger
my
colleagues
and
i
watched
you
when
you
left
the
cylinder
and
when
you
shot
the
birds
and
seeing
your
doom
in
the
air
have
been
trying
to
communicate
with
you
what
were
the
strange
shadows
and
prismatic
colours
that
kept
passing
across
our
table
asked
bearwarden
they
were
the
obstructions
and
refractions
of
light
caused
by
spirits
trying
to
take
shape
replied
the
shade
do
you
mind
our
asking
you
questions
said
cortlandt
no
replied
their
visitor
if
i
can
i
will
answer
them
then
said
cortlandt
how
is
it
that
of
the
several
spirits
that
tried
to
become
embodied
we
see
but
one
namely
you
that
said
the
shade
is
because
no
natural
law
is
broken
on
earth
one
man
can
learn
a
handicraft
better
in
a
few
days
than
another
in
a
month
while
some
can
solve
with
ease
a
mathematical
problem
that
others
could
never
grasp
so
it
is
here
perhaps
i
was
in
a
favourable
frame
of
mind
on
dying
for
the
supernatural
always
interested
me
on
earth
or
i
had
a
natural
aptitude
for
these
things
for
soon
after
death
i
was
able
to
affect
the
senses
of
the
friends
i
had
left
are
we
to
understand
then
asked
cortlandt
that
the
reason
more
of
our
departed
do
not
reappear
to
us
is
because
they
can
not
precisely
replied
the
shade
but
though
the
percentage
of
those
that
can
return
and
reappear
on
earth
is
small
their
number
is
fairly
large
history
has
many
cases
we
know
that
the
prophet
samuel
raised
the
witch
of
endor
at
the
behest
of
saul
that
moses
and
elias
became
visible
in
the
transfiguration
and
that
after
his
crucifixion
and
burial
christ
returned
to
his
disciples
and
was
seen
and
heard
by
many
others
how
asked
bearwarden
deferentially
do
you
occupy
your
time
time
replied
the
spirit
has
not
the
same
significance
to
us
that
it
has
to
you
you
know
that
while
the
earth
rotates
in
hours
this
planet
takes
but
about
ten
and
the
sun
turns
on
its
own
axis
but
once
in
a
terrestrial
month
while
the
years
of
the
planets
vary
from
less
than
three
months
for
mercury
to
neptune
one
hundred
and
years
being
insensible
to
heat
and
cold
darkness
and
light
we
have
no
more
changing
seasons
neither
is
there
any
night
when
a
man
dies
he
continued
with
solemnity
he
comes
at
once
into
the
enjoyment
of
senses
vastly
keener
than
any
be
possessed
before
our
eyes
if
such
they
can
be
called
are
both
microscopes
and
telescopes
the
change
in
focus
being
effected
as
instantaneously
as
thought
enabling
us
to
perceive
the
smallest
microbe
or
and
to
see
the
planets
that
revolve
about
the
stars
the
step
of
a
fly
is
to
us
as
audible
as
the
tramp
of
a
regiment
while
we
hear
the
mechanical
and
chemical
action
of
a
snake
poison
on
the
blood
of
any
poor
creature
bitten
as
plainly
as
the
waves
on
the
shore
we
also
have
a
chemical
and
electrical
sense
showing
us
what
effect
different
substances
will
have
on
one
another
and
what
changes
to
expect
in
the
weather
the
most
complex
and
subtle
of
our
senses
however
is
a
sort
of
second
sight
that
we
call
intuition
or
prescience
which
we
are
still
studying
to
perfect
and
understand
with
our
eyes
closed
it
reveals
to
us
approaching
astronomical
and
other
bodies
or
what
is
happening
on
the
other
side
of
the
planet
and
enables
us
to
view
the
future
as
you
do
the
past
the
eyes
of
all
but
the
highest
angels
require
some
light
and
can
be
dazzled
by
an
excess
but
this
attribute
of
divinity
nothing
can
obscure
and
it
is
the
sense
that
will
first
enable
us
to
know
god
by
means
of
these
new
and
sharpened
faculties
which
like
children
we
are
continually
learning
to
use
to
better
advantage
we
constantly
increase
our
knowledge
and
this
is
next
to
our
greatest
happiness
is
there
any
limit
asked
bearwarden
to
human
progress
on
the
earth
practically
none
replied
the
spirit
progress
depends
largely
on
your
command
of
the
forces
of
nature
at
present
your
principal
sources
of
power
are
food
fuel
electricity
the
heat
of
the
interior
of
the
earth
wind
and
tide
from
the
first
two
you
can
not
expect
much
more
than
now
but
from
the
internal
heat
everywhere
available
tradewinds
and
falling
water
as
at
niagara
and
from
tides
you
can
obtain
power
almost
without
limit
were
this
all
however
your
progress
would
be
slow
but
the
eternal
realizing
the
shortness
of
your
lives
has
given
you
power
with
which
to
rend
the
globe
you
have
the
action
of
all
uncombined
chemicals
atmospheric
electricity
the
excess
or
froth
of
which
you
now
see
in
thunderstorms
and
the
electricity
and
magnetism
of
your
own
bodies
there
is
also
molecular
and
sympathetic
vibration
by
which
joshua
not
understandingly
levelled
the
walls
of
jericho
and
the
power
of
your
minds
over
matter
but
little
more
developed
now
than
when
i
moved
in
the
flesh
upon
the
earth
by
lowering
large
quantities
of
explosives
to
the
deepest
parts
of
the
ocean
bed
and
exploding
them
there
you
can
produce
chasms
through
which
some
water
will
be
forced
towards
the
heated
interior
by
the
enormous
pressure
of
its
own
weight
at
a
comparatively
slight
depth
it
will
be
converted
into
steam
and
produce
an
earthquake
this
will
so
enlarge
your
chasm
that
a
great
volume
of
water
will
rush
into
the
interior
which
will
cause
a
series
of
such
terrific
eruptions
that
large
islands
will
be
upheaved
by
the
reduction
of
the
heat
of
that
part
of
the
interior
there
will
also
be
a
shrinkage
which
in
connection
with
the
explosions
will
cause
the
earth
solid
crust
to
be
thrown
up
in
folds
till
whole
continents
appear
some
of
the
water
displaced
by
the
new
land
will
also
as
a
result
of
the
cooling
be
able
permanently
to
penetrate
farther
thereby
decreasing
by
that
much
the
amount
of
water
in
the
oceans
so
that
the
in
your
existing
seaports
will
be
but
slightly
changed
by
persevering
in
this
work
you
will
become
so
skilled
that
it
will
be
possible
to
evoke
land
of
whatever
kind
you
wish
at
any
place
and
by
having
high
at
the
equator
sloping
off
into
low
plains
towards
north
and
south
and
maintaining
volcanoes
in
eruption
at
the
poles
to
throw
out
heat
and
start
warm
ocean
currents
it
will
be
possible
in
connection
with
the
change
you
are
now
making
in
the
axis
to
render
the
conditions
of
life
so
easy
that
the
earth
will
support
a
far
larger
number
of
souls
with
the
powers
at
your
disposal
you
can
also
alter
and
improve
existing
continents
and
thereby
still
further
increase
the
number
of
the
children
of
men
perhaps
with
mild
climate
fertile
soil
and
decreased
struggle
for
existence
man
will
develop
his
spiritual
side
finally
you
have
apergy
one
of
the
highest
forces
for
it
puts
you
almost
on
a
plane
with
angels
and
with
it
you
have
already
visited
jupiter
and
saturn
it
was
impossible
that
man
should
remain
chained
to
the
earth
during
the
entire
life
of
his
race
like
an
inferior
animal
or
a
mineral
lower
even
in
freedom
of
body
than
birds
heretofore
you
have
as
i
have
said
seen
but
one
side
in
many
workings
of
nature
as
if
you
had
discovered
either
negative
or
positive
electricity
but
not
both
for
gravitation
and
apergy
are
as
inseparably
combined
in
the
rest
of
the
universe
as
those
two
separated
temporarily
on
earth
that
the
discovery
of
the
utilization
of
one
with
the
other
might
serve
as
an
incentive
to
your
minds
you
saw
it
in
nature
on
jupiter
in
the
case
of
several
creatures
suspecting
it
in
the
and
and
and
have
standing
illustrations
of
it
in
all
tailed
comets
luminosity
in
the
case
of
large
bodies
being
one
manifestation
in
the
rings
of
this
planet
and
in
the
molecular
motion
and
porosity
of
all
gases
liquids
and
solids
on
earth
since
what
else
is
it
that
keeps
the
molecules
apart
heat
serving
merely
to
increase
its
power
god
made
man
in
his
own
image
does
it
not
stand
to
reason
that
he
will
allow
him
to
continue
to
become
more
and
more
like
himself
would
he
begrudge
him
the
power
to
move
mountains
through
the
intelligent
application
of
nature
laws
when
he
himself
said
they
might
be
moved
by
faith
so
far
you
have
been
content
to
use
the
mechanical
power
of
water
its
momentum
or
dead
weight
merely
to
attain
a
much
higher
civilization
you
must
break
it
up
chemically
and
use
its
constituent
gases
how
asked
bearwarden
can
this
be
done
force
superheated
steam
replied
the
spirit
through
an
intensely
heated
substance
as
you
now
do
in
making
preferably
platinum
heated
by
electricity
apply
an
apergetic
shock
and
the
oxygen
and
hydrogen
will
separate
like
oil
and
water
the
oxygen
being
so
much
the
heavier
lead
them
in
different
directions
as
fast
as
the
water
is
decomposed
since
otherwise
they
would
reunite
and
your
supply
of
power
will
be
inexhaustible
will
you
not
stay
and
dine
with
us
asked
ayrault
while
in
the
flesh
you
must
be
subject
to
its
laws
and
must
need
food
to
maintain
your
strength
like
ourselves
it
will
give
me
great
pleasure
replied
the
spirit
to
tarry
with
you
and
once
more
to
taste
earthly
food
but
most
of
all
to
have
the
blessed
joy
of
being
of
service
to
you
here
all
being
immaterial
spirits
no
physical
injury
can
befall
any
of
us
and
since
no
one
wants
anything
that
any
one
else
can
give
we
have
no
opportunity
of
doing
anything
for
each
other
you
see
we
neither
eat
nor
sleep
neither
can
any
of
us
again
know
physical
pain
or
death
nor
can
we
comfort
one
another
for
every
one
knows
the
truth
about
himself
and
every
one
else
and
we
read
one
another
thoughts
as
an
open
book
do
you
asked
bearwarden
not
eat
at
all
we
absorb
vitality
in
a
sense
replied
the
spirit
as
the
sun
combines
certain
substances
into
food
for
mortals
it
also
produces
molecular
vibration
and
charges
the
air
with
magnetism
and
electricity
which
we
absorb
without
effort
in
fact
there
is
a
faint
pleasure
in
the
absorption
of
this
strength
when
in
magnetic
disturbances
there
is
an
unusual
amount
of
immortal
food
should
we
try
to
resist
it
there
would
eventually
be
a
greater
pressure
without
than
within
and
we
should
assimilate
involuntarily
we
are
part
of
the
intangible
universe
and
can
feel
no
hunger
that
is
not
instantly
appeased
neither
can
we
ever
more
know
thirst
why
asked
cortlandt
reverently
did
the
angel
with
the
sword
of
flame
drive
adam
from
the
tree
of
life
since
with
his
soul
he
had
received
that
which
could
never
die
that
was
part
of
the
mercy
of
god
the
shade
replied
for
immortality
could
be
enjoyed
but
meagrely
on
earth
where
natural
limitations
are
so
abrupt
and
know
this
ye
who
are
something
of
chemists
that
had
adam
eaten
of
that
substance
called
fruit
he
would
have
lived
in
the
flesh
to
this
day
and
would
have
been
of
all
men
the
most
unhappy
will
the
fountain
of
youth
ever
be
discovered
asked
cortlandt
that
substances
exist
replied
the
spirit
that
render
it
impossible
for
the
germs
of
old
age
and
decay
to
lodge
in
the
body
i
know
in
fact
it
would
be
a
break
in
the
continuity
and
balance
of
nature
did
they
not
but
i
believe
their
discovery
will
be
coincident
with
christ
second
visible
advent
on
earth
you
are
however
only
on
the
shore
of
the
ocean
of
knowledge
and
by
continuing
to
advance
in
geometric
ratio
will
soon
be
able
to
retain
your
mortal
bodies
till
the
average
longevity
exceeds
methuselah
but
except
for
more
opportunities
of
doing
good
or
setting
a
longer
example
to
your
fellows
by
your
lives
where
would
be
the
gain
i
now
see
how
what
appeared
to
me
while
i
lived
on
earth
insignificant
incidents
were
the
acts
of
god
and
that
what
i
thought
injustice
or
misfortune
was
but
evidence
of
his
wisdom
and
love
for
we
know
that
not
a
sparrow
falleth
without
god
and
that
the
hairs
of
our
heads
are
numbered
every
act
of
kindness
or
unselfishness
on
my
part
also
stands
out
like
a
golden
letter
or
a
white
stone
and
gives
me
unspeakable
comfort
at
the
last
judgment
and
in
eternity
following
we
shall
have
very
different
but
just
as
real
bodies
as
those
that
we
possessed
in
the
flesh
the
dead
at
the
last
trump
will
rise
clothed
in
them
and
at
that
time
the
souls
in
paradise
will
receive
them
also
i
wonder
thought
ayrault
on
which
hand
we
shall
be
placed
in
that
last
day
the
classification
is
now
going
on
said
the
spirit
answering
his
thought
and
i
know
that
in
the
final
judgment
each
individual
will
range
himself
automatically
on
his
proper
side
do
tell
me
said
ayrault
how
you
were
able
to
answer
my
thought
i
see
the
vibrations
of
the
grey
matter
of
your
brain
as
plainly
as
the
movements
of
your
lips
in
fact
i
see
the
thoughts
in
the
embryonic
state
taking
shape
when
their
meal
was
ready
they
sat
down
ayrault
placing
the
spirit
on
his
right
with
cortlandt
on
his
left
and
having
bearwarden
opposite
on
this
occasion
their
chief
had
given
them
a
particularly
good
dinner
but
the
spirit
took
only
a
slice
of
meat
and
a
glass
of
claret
wo
you
tell
us
the
story
of
your
life
said
ayrault
to
the
spirit
and
your
experiences
since
your
death
they
would
be
of
tremendous
interest
to
us
i
was
a
bishop
in
one
of
the
atlantic
states
replied
the
spirit
gravely
and
died
shortly
before
the
civil
war
people
came
from
other
cities
to
hear
my
sermons
and
the
biographical
writers
have
honoured
my
memory
by
saying
that
i
was
a
great
man
i
was
contemporaneous
with
daniel
webster
and
henry
clay
shortly
after
i
reached
threescore
and
ten
according
to
earthly
years
i
caught
what
i
considered
only
a
slight
cold
for
i
had
always
had
good
health
but
it
became
pneumonia
my
friends
children
and
grandchildren
came
to
see
me
and
all
seemed
going
well
when
without
warning
my
physician
told
me
i
had
but
a
few
hours
to
live
i
could
scarcely
believe
my
ears
and
though
as
a
churchman
i
had
ministered
to
others
and
had
always
tried
to
lead
a
good
life
i
was
greatly
shocked
i
suddenly
remembered
all
the
things
i
had
left
undone
and
all
the
things
i
intended
to
do
and
the
old
saying
is
paved
with
good
intentions
crossed
my
mind
very
forcibly
in
less
than
an
hour
i
saw
the
physician
was
right
i
grew
weaker
and
my
pulse
fluttered
but
my
mind
remained
clear
i
prayed
to
my
creator
with
all
my
soul
spare
me
a
little
that
i
may
recover
my
strength
before
i
go
hence
and
be
no
more
seen
as
if
for
an
answer
the
thought
crossed
my
brain
thine
house
in
order
for
thou
shalt
not
live
but
die
i
then
called
my
children
and
made
disposition
of
such
of
my
property
and
personal
effects
as
were
not
covered
by
my
will
i
also
gave
to
each
the
advice
that
my
experience
had
shown
me
he
or
she
needed
then
came
another
wave
of
remorse
and
regret
and
again
an
intense
longing
to
pray
but
along
with
the
thought
of
sins
and
neglected
duties
came
also
the
memory
of
the
honest
efforts
i
had
made
to
obey
my
conscience
and
these
were
like
rifts
of
sunshine
during
a
storm
these
thoughts
and
the
blessed
promises
of
religion
i
had
so
often
preached
in
the
churches
of
my
diocese
were
an
indescribable
comfort
and
saved
me
from
the
depths
of
blank
despair
finally
my
breathing
became
laboured
i
had
sharp
spasms
of
pain
and
my
pulse
almost
stopped
i
felt
that
i
was
dying
and
my
sight
grew
dim
the
crisis
and
climax
of
life
were
at
hand
i
thought
with
the
philosophers
and
sages
it
to
this
end
i
lived
the
flower
appears
briefly
blooms
amid
troublous
toil
and
is
gone
my
body
returns
to
its
primordial
dust
and
my
works
are
buried
in
oblivion
the
paths
of
life
and
glory
lead
but
to
the
grave
my
soul
was
filled
with
conflicting
thoughts
and
for
a
moment
even
my
faith
seemed
at
a
low
ebb
i
could
hear
my
stifled
sobs
and
my
darling
wife
shed
silent
tears
the
thought
of
parting
from
them
gave
me
the
bitterest
wrench
with
my
fleeting
breath
i
gasped
these
words
mercy
i
showed
others
that
show
thou
me
the
darkened
room
grew
darker
and
after
that
i
died
in
my
sleep
i
seemed
to
dream
all
about
were
refined
and
heavenly
flowers
while
the
most
delightful
sounds
and
perfumes
filled
the
air
gradually
the
vision
became
more
distinct
and
i
experienced
an
indescribable
feeling
of
peace
and
repose
i
passed
through
fields
and
scenes
i
had
never
seen
before
while
every
place
was
filled
with
an
light
sometimes
i
seemed
to
be
miles
in
air
countless
suns
and
their
planets
shone
and
dazzled
my
eyes
while
no
was
as
happy
or
free
as
i
gradually
it
came
to
me
that
i
was
awake
and
that
it
was
no
dream
then
i
remembered
my
last
moments
and
perceived
that
i
had
died
death
had
brought
freedom
my
work
in
the
flesh
was
ended
i
was
indeed
alive
death
where
is
thy
sting
o
grave
where
is
thy
victory
in
my
dying
moments
i
had
forgotten
what
i
had
so
often
preached
fool
that
which
thou
sowest
is
not
quickened
except
it
die
in
a
moment
my
life
lay
before
me
like
a
valley
or
an
open
page
all
along
its
paths
and
waysides
i
saw
the
little
seeds
of
word
and
deed
that
i
had
sown
extending
and
bearing
fruit
forever
for
good
or
evil
i
then
saw
things
as
they
were
and
realized
the
faultiness
of
my
former
conclusions
based
as
they
had
been
on
the
incomplete
knowledge
obtained
through
embryonic
senses
i
also
saw
the
divine
purpose
in
life
as
the
design
in
a
piece
of
tapestry
whereas
before
i
had
seen
but
the
wrong
side
it
is
not
till
we
have
lost
the
life
in
the
flesh
that
we
realize
its
dignity
and
value
for
every
hour
gives
us
opportunities
of
helping
or
elevating
some
human
being
it
may
be
ourselves
of
doing
something
in
his
service
now
that
time
is
past
the
books
are
closed
and
we
can
do
nothing
further
ourselves
to
alter
our
status
for
eternity
however
much
we
may
wish
to
it
is
on
this
account
and
not
merely
to
save
you
from
death
which
in
itself
is
nothing
that
i
now
tell
you
to
run
to
the
callisto
seal
the
doors
hermetically
and
come
not
forth
till
a
sudden
rush
of
air
that
you
will
see
on
the
trees
has
passed
a
gust
in
which
even
birds
drop
dead
if
they
are
unable
to
escape
will
be
here
when
you
reach
safety
do
not
delay
to
take
this
food
and
eat
none
of
it
when
you
return
for
it
will
be
filled
with
poisonous
germs
how
can
we
find
you
asked
ayrault
grasping
his
hand
you
must
not
leave
us
till
we
know
how
we
can
see
you
again
think
hard
and
steadfastly
of
me
you
three
replied
the
spirit
if
you
want
me
and
i
shall
feel
your
thought
saying
which
he
vanished
before
their
eyes
and
the
three
friends
ran
to
the
callisto
chapter
iii
doubts
and
philosophy
on
reaching
it
they
climbed
the
ladder
leading
to
the
opening
and
entering
through
this
they
closed
the
door
screwing
it
tightly
in
place
now
said
cortlandt
we
can
see
what
changes
if
any
this
wonderful
gust
will
effect
he
made
no
strictures
on
our
senses
such
as
they
are
said
bearwarden
but
implied
that
evolution
would
be
carried
much
further
in
us
from
which
i
suppose
we
may
infer
that
it
has
not
yet
gone
far
i
wish
we
had
recorked
those
brandy
peaches
for
now
they
will
be
filled
with
poisonous
germs
i
wonder
if
our
shady
friend
could
not
tell
us
of
an
antiseptic
with
which
they
might
be
treated
those
fellows
thought
ayrault
who
had
climbed
to
the
dome
from
which
he
had
an
extended
view
would
jeer
at
an
angel
while
the
deference
they
showed
the
spirit
seems
as
usual
to
have
been
merely
superficial
let
us
note
said
cortlandt
that
the
spirit
thermometer
outside
has
fallen
several
degrees
since
we
entered
though
from
the
time
taken
i
should
not
say
that
the
sudden
change
would
be
one
of
temperature
just
then
they
saw
a
number
of
birds
which
had
been
resting
in
a
clump
of
trees
take
flight
suddenly
but
they
fell
to
the
ground
before
they
had
risen
far
and
were
dashed
to
pieces
in
another
moment
the
trees
began
to
bend
and
sway
before
the
storm
and
as
they
gazed
the
colour
of
the
leaves
turned
from
green
and
purple
to
orange
and
red
the
wind
blew
off
many
of
these
and
they
were
carried
along
by
the
gusts
or
fluttered
to
the
ground
which
was
soon
strewed
with
them
it
was
a
typical
autumnal
scene
presently
the
wind
shifted
and
this
was
followed
by
a
cold
shower
of
rain
i
think
the
worst
is
over
said
bearwarden
the
guide
says
the
rain
before
the
wind
halliards
sheets
and
braces
mind
when
the
wind
before
the
rain
soon
you
can
make
sail
again
doubtless
that
will
hold
good
here
this
proved
to
be
correct
and
after
a
repetition
of
the
precautions
they
had
taken
on
their
arrival
on
the
planet
in
regard
to
the
inhalability
of
the
air
they
again
sallied
forth
they
left
their
magazine
taking
instead
the
kind
on
account
of
the
rapidity
with
which
this
enabled
them
to
fire
the
second
barrel
after
the
first
and
threw
away
the
water
that
had
collected
in
the
bucket
out
of
respect
to
the
spirit
warning
they
noticed
a
pungent
odour
and
decided
to
remain
on
high
ground
since
they
had
observed
that
the
birds
in
their
effort
to
escape
had
flown
almost
vertically
into
the
air
on
reaching
the
grove
in
which
they
had
seen
the
storm
they
found
their
table
and
everything
on
it
exactly
as
they
had
left
it
bearwarden
threw
out
the
brandy
peaches
on
the
ground
exclaiming
that
it
was
a
shame
to
lose
such
good
preserves
and
they
proceeded
on
their
walk
they
passed
hundreds
of
dead
birds
and
on
reaching
the
edge
of
the
toadstool
valley
were
not
a
little
surprised
to
find
that
every
toadstool
had
disappeared
i
wonder
said
the
doctor
if
there
can
be
any
connection
between
the
phenomenon
of
the
disappearance
of
those
toadstools
and
the
death
of
the
birds
we
could
easily
discover
it
if
they
had
eaten
them
or
if
in
any
other
way
the
plants
could
have
entered
their
bodies
but
i
see
no
way
in
which
that
can
have
happened
resolving
to
investigate
carefully
any
other
fungi
they
might
see
they
resumed
their
march
the
cold
sun
apparently
about
the
size
of
an
orange
was
near
the
horizon
saturn
rotation
on
its
axis
occupying
only
ten
hours
and
fourteen
minutes
being
but
a
few
minutes
longer
than
jupiter
they
knew
it
would
soon
be
night
finding
a
place
on
a
range
of
hills
sheltered
by
rocks
and
a
clump
of
trees
of
the
evergreen
species
they
arranged
themselves
as
comfortably
as
possible
ate
some
of
the
sandwiches
they
had
brought
lighted
their
pipes
and
watched
the
dying
day
here
were
no
to
light
the
darkening
minutes
nor
singing
flowers
to
lull
them
to
sleep
with
their
song
but
six
of
the
eight
moons
each
at
a
different
phase
and
with
varied
brightness
bathed
the
landscape
in
their
pale
cold
rays
while
far
above
them
like
a
huge
rainbow
stretched
the
great
rings
in
effulgent
sheets
reaching
thousands
of
miles
into
space
and
flooded
everything
with
their
silvery
light
how
poor
a
place
compared
with
this
they
thought
to
themselves
is
our
world
and
ayrault
wished
that
his
soul
was
already
free
while
the
dead
leaves
rustling
in
the
gentle
breeze
and
the
nightwinds
sighing
among
the
trees
seemed
to
echo
his
thought
far
above
their
heads
and
in
the
vastness
of
space
the
stars
and
constellations
notwithstanding
the
enormous
distance
they
had
now
come
looked
absolutely
unchanged
and
seemed
to
them
emblematic
of
tranquillity
and
eternal
repose
the
days
were
changed
by
their
shortness
and
by
the
apparent
loss
of
power
in
the
sun
and
the
nights
as
if
in
compensation
were
magnificently
illuminated
by
the
numerous
moons
and
splendid
rings
though
neither
rings
nor
satellites
shone
with
as
strong
a
light
as
the
terrestrial
moon
but
in
nothing
outside
of
the
solar
system
was
there
any
change
and
could
aeneas
palinurus
or
one
of
philip
of
shepherds
be
brought
to
life
here
he
would
see
exactly
the
same
stars
in
the
same
positions
and
did
he
not
know
of
his
own
death
or
of
the
lapse
of
time
he
might
suppose
so
far
as
the
heavens
were
affected
that
he
had
but
fallen
asleep
or
had
just
closed
his
eyes
i
have
always
regretted
said
cortlandt
that
i
was
not
born
a
thousand
years
later
were
it
not
added
ayrault
that
our
earth
is
the
vestibule
to
space
and
for
the
opportunities
it
opens
i
should
rather
never
have
lived
for
life
in
itself
is
unsatisfying
you
fellows
are
too
indefinite
and
abstract
for
me
said
bearwarden
i
like
something
tangible
and
concrete
the
utilitarianism
of
the
twentieth
century
by
which
i
live
paradoxical
though
it
may
seem
would
be
out
of
place
in
space
unless
we
can
colonize
the
other
planets
and
improve
their
arrangements
and
axes
mixed
with
ayrault
philosophical
and
metaphysical
thoughts
were
the
memories
of
his
sweetheart
at
vassar
and
he
longed
more
than
his
companions
for
the
spirit
return
that
he
might
ask
him
if
perchance
he
could
tell
him
aught
of
her
and
whether
her
thoughts
were
then
of
him
finally
worn
out
by
the
fatigue
and
excitement
of
the
day
they
set
the
more
from
force
of
habit
than
because
they
feared
molestation
and
rolling
themselves
in
their
blankets
for
the
night
was
cold
were
soon
fast
asleep
ayrault
last
thought
having
been
of
his
fiancee
cortlandt
of
the
question
he
wished
to
ask
the
spirit
and
bearwarden
of
the
progress
of
his
company
in
the
work
of
straightening
the
terrestrial
axis
thus
they
slept
seven
hundred
and
ninety
million
miles
beyond
their
earth
orbit
and
more
than
eight
hundred
million
from
the
place
where
the
earth
was
then
while
they
lay
unconscious
the
clouds
above
them
froze
and
before
morning
there
was
a
fall
of
snow
that
covered
the
ground
and
them
as
they
lay
upon
it
soon
three
white
mounds
were
all
that
marked
their
presence
and
the
cranes
and
eagles
rising
from
their
roosts
in
response
to
the
coming
day
looked
unconcernedly
at
all
that
was
human
that
they
had
ever
seen
finally
wakened
by
the
resounding
cries
of
these
birds
bearwarden
and
cortlandt
arose
and
meeting
ayrault
who
had
already
risen
mistook
the
snowy
form
before
them
for
the
spirit
and
thinking
the
dead
bishop
had
revisited
them
they
were
preparing
to
welcome
him
and
to
propound
the
questions
they
had
formulated
when
familiar
voice
showed
them
their
mistake
seeing
your
white
figures
said
he
rise
apparently
in
response
to
those
loud
calls
reminded
me
of
what
the
spirit
told
us
of
the
last
day
and
of
the
awakening
and
resurrection
of
the
dead
the
scene
was
indeed
weird
the
east
already
streaked
with
the
rays
of
the
rising
sun
and
the
pale
moons
nearing
the
horizon
in
the
west
seemed
connected
by
the
huge
bow
of
light
the
snow
on
the
dark
evergreens
produced
a
contrast
of
colour
while
the
other
trees
raised
their
almost
bare
and
whitened
branches
against
the
sky
as
though
in
supplication
to
the
mysterious
rings
which
cast
their
light
upon
them
and
on
the
ground
as
they
gazed
however
the
rings
became
grey
the
moons
disappeared
and
another
day
began
feeling
sure
the
snow
must
have
cleared
the
air
of
any
deleterious
substances
it
contained
the
day
before
they
descended
into
the
neighbouring
valley
which
having
a
southerly
exposure
was
warm
in
comparison
with
the
hills
as
they
walked
they
disturbed
a
number
of
small
rodents
which
quickly
ran
away
and
disappeared
in
their
holes
though
we
have
seen
none
of
the
huge
creatures
here
said
cortlandt
that
were
so
plentiful
on
jupiter
these
burrowers
belong
to
a
distinctly
higher
scale
than
those
we
found
there
from
which
i
take
it
we
may
infer
that
the
evolution
of
the
animal
kingdom
has
advanced
further
on
this
planet
than
on
jupiter
which
is
just
what
we
have
a
right
to
expect
for
saturn
in
addition
to
being
the
smaller
and
therefore
more
matured
of
the
two
has
doubtless
had
a
longer
individual
existence
being
the
farther
from
the
sun
notwithstanding
the
cold
of
the
night
the
flowers
especially
the
lilies
were
as
beautiful
as
ever
which
surprised
them
not
a
little
until
on
examining
them
closely
they
found
that
the
stems
and
veins
in
the
leaves
were
fluted
and
therefore
elastic
so
that
should
the
sap
freeze
it
could
expand
without
bursting
the
cells
thereby
enabling
the
flowers
to
withstand
a
short
frost
they
noticed
that
many
of
the
curiously
shaped
birds
they
saw
at
a
distance
from
time
to
time
were
able
to
move
with
great
rapidity
along
the
ground
and
had
about
concluded
that
they
must
have
four
legs
being
similar
to
winged
squirrels
when
a
long
low
quadruped
about
feet
from
nostrils
to
tail
which
they
were
endeavouring
to
stalk
suddenly
spread
two
pairs
of
wings
flapping
the
four
at
once
and
then
soared
off
at
great
speed
i
hope
we
can
get
one
of
those
or
at
least
his
photograph
said
cortlandt
if
they
go
in
pairs
said
bearwarden
we
may
find
the
companion
near
at
that
moment
another
great
winged
lizard
considerably
larger
than
the
first
rose
with
a
snort
not
twenty
yards
on
their
left
cortlandt
who
was
a
good
shot
with
a
gun
at
short
range
immediately
raised
his
and
fired
both
barrels
at
the
monster
but
the
shots
had
no
more
disabling
effect
than
if
they
had
been
number
eights
they
however
excited
the
creature
ire
for
sweeping
around
quickly
it
made
straight
for
cortlandt
breathing
at
him
when
near
and
almost
overpowering
the
three
men
with
the
malodorous
poisonous
cloud
it
exhaled
instantly
bearwarden
fired
several
revolver
bullets
down
its
throat
while
ayrault
pulled
both
barrels
almost
simultaneously
with
the
muzzles
but
a
few
inches
from
its
side
in
this
case
the
initial
velocity
of
the
heavy
buckshot
was
so
great
and
they
were
still
so
close
together
that
they
penetrated
the
leathery
hide
tearing
a
large
hole
with
a
roar
the
wounded
monster
beat
a
retreat
first
almost
prostrating
them
with
another
blast
of
its
awful
breath
it
would
take
a
stronger
light
than
we
get
here
said
bearwarden
to
impress
a
negative
through
that
haze
i
think
he
continued
i
know
a
trick
that
will
do
the
business
if
we
see
any
more
of
these
dragons
saying
which
he
withdrew
the
cartridges
from
his
gun
and
with
his
cut
the
tough
paper
shell
nearly
through
between
the
wads
separating
the
powder
from
the
shot
drawing
his
knife
entirely
around
now
said
he
when
i
fire
those
the
entire
forward
end
of
the
cartridge
will
go
out
keeping
the
fifteen
buckshot
together
like
a
slug
and
with
such
penetration
that
it
will
go
through
a
plank
it
is
a
trick
i
learned
from
hunters
and
unless
your
guns
are
in
which
case
it
might
burst
the
barrel
i
advise
you
to
follow
suit
finding
they
had
brought
guns
they
arranged
their
cartridges
similarly
and
set
out
in
the
direction
in
which
the
winged
lizards
or
dragons
had
gone
chapter
iv
a
providential
intervention
the
valley
narrowed
as
they
advanced
the
banks
rising
gently
on
both
sides
both
dragons
had
flown
straight
to
a
grove
of
tall
spreading
trees
on
coming
near
to
this
they
noticed
a
faint
smell
like
that
of
the
dragon
and
also
like
the
trace
they
found
in
the
air
on
leaving
the
callisto
the
day
before
after
they
had
sought
safety
within
it
soon
it
almost
knocked
them
down
we
must
get
to
windward
said
cortlandt
i
already
feel
faint
and
believe
those
dragons
could
kill
a
man
by
breathing
on
him
accordingly
they
skirted
around
the
grove
and
having
made
a
quarter
circle
for
they
did
not
wish
the
dragons
to
wind
them
again
drew
nearer
tree
after
tree
was
passed
and
finally
they
saw
an
open
space
twelve
or
fifteen
acres
in
area
at
the
centre
of
the
grove
when
they
were
arrested
by
a
curious
sound
of
munching
peering
among
the
trunks
of
the
huge
trees
they
advanced
cautiously
but
stopped
aghast
in
the
opening
were
at
least
a
hundred
dragons
devouring
the
toadstools
with
which
the
ground
was
covered
many
of
them
were
thirty
to
forty
feet
long
with
huge
and
terribly
long
sharp
claws
and
jaws
armed
with
gleaming
batteries
of
teeth
though
they
had
evidently
lungs
and
the
claws
and
mouth
of
an
animal
they
reminded
the
observers
in
many
respects
of
insects
enormously
exaggerated
for
their
wings
composed
of
a
sort
of
transparent
scale
were
small
and
moved
as
they
had
already
seen
at
far
greater
speed
than
those
of
a
bird
their
projecting
eyes
were
also
set
rigidly
in
their
heads
instead
of
turning
and
consisted
of
a
number
of
flat
surfaces
or
facets
like
a
fly
eye
so
that
they
could
see
backward
and
all
around
each
facet
seeing
anything
the
rays
from
which
came
at
right
angles
to
its
surface
this
beautiful
grove
was
doubtless
their
and
as
such
was
likely
to
be
visited
by
many
more
concluding
it
would
be
wise
to
let
their
wounded
game
escape
the
three
men
were
about
to
retreat
having
found
it
difficult
to
breathe
the
air
even
at
that
distance
from
the
monsters
when
the
wounded
dragon
that
they
had
observed
moving
about
in
a
very
restless
manner
and
evidently
suffering
a
good
deal
from
the
effect
of
its
wounds
espied
them
and
with
a
roar
that
made
the
echoes
ring
started
towards
them
slowly
along
the
ground
followed
by
the
entire
herd
the
nearer
of
which
now
also
saw
them
seeing
that
their
lives
were
in
danger
the
hunters
quickly
regained
the
open
and
then
stretched
their
legs
against
the
wind
the
dragons
came
through
the
trees
on
the
ground
and
then
raising
themselves
by
their
wings
the
whole
swarm
snorting
and
darkening
the
air
with
their
deadly
breath
made
straight
for
the
men
who
by
comparison
looked
like
lilliputians
with
the
slug
from
his
right
barrel
bearwarden
ended
the
wounded
dragon
career
by
shooting
him
through
the
head
and
with
his
left
laid
low
the
one
following
ayrault
also
killed
two
huge
monsters
and
cortlandt
killed
one
and
wounded
another
their
supply
of
prepared
cartridges
was
then
exhausted
and
they
fell
back
on
their
revolvers
and
ineffective
spreading
shot
resolved
to
sell
their
lives
dearly
they
retreated
keeping
their
backs
to
the
wind
with
the
poisonous
dragons
in
front
but
the
breeze
was
very
slight
and
they
were
being
rapidly
blinded
and
asphyxiated
by
the
loathsome
fumes
and
deafened
by
the
hideous
roaring
and
snapping
of
the
jaws
realizing
that
they
could
not
much
longer
reply
to
the
diabolical
host
with
lead
they
believed
their
last
hour
had
come
when
the
ground
on
which
they
were
making
their
last
stand
shook
there
was
a
rending
of
rocks
and
a
rush
of
imprisoned
steam
that
drowned
even
the
dragons
roar
and
they
were
separated
from
them
by
a
long
fissure
and
a
wall
of
smoke
and
vapour
struggling
back
from
the
edge
of
the
chasm
they
fell
upon
the
ground
and
then
for
the
first
time
fully
realized
that
the
earthquake
had
saved
them
for
the
dragons
could
not
come
across
the
opening
and
would
not
venture
to
fly
through
the
smoke
and
steam
when
they
recovered
somewhat
from
the
shock
they
cut
a
number
of
cartridges
in
the
same
way
that
they
had
prepared
those
that
had
done
them
such
good
service
and
kept
one
barrel
of
each
gun
loaded
with
that
kind
we
may
thank
providence
said
bearwarden
for
that
escape
i
hope
we
shall
have
no
more
such
close
calls
with
a
parting
glance
at
the
chasm
that
had
saved
their
lives
and
from
which
a
cloud
still
arose
they
turned
slightly
to
the
right
of
their
former
course
and
climbed
the
gently
rising
bank
when
near
the
top
being
tired
of
their
exciting
experiences
they
sat
down
to
rest
the
ground
all
about
them
was
covered
with
mushrooms
white
on
top
and
pink
underneath
this
is
a
wonderful
place
for
fungi
said
ayrault
here
doubtless
we
shall
be
safe
from
the
dragons
for
they
seemed
to
prefer
the
toadstools
as
he
lay
on
the
ground
he
watched
one
particular
mushroom
that
seemed
to
grow
before
his
eyes
suddenly
as
he
looked
it
vanished
dumfounded
at
this
unmistakable
manifestation
of
the
phenomenon
they
thought
they
had
seen
on
landing
he
called
his
companions
and
choosing
another
mushroom
the
three
watched
it
closely
presently
without
the
least
noise
or
commotion
that
also
disappeared
leaving
no
trace
and
the
same
fate
befell
a
number
of
others
at
a
certain
point
of
their
development
they
vanished
as
completely
as
a
bubble
of
air
coming
to
the
surface
of
water
except
that
they
caused
no
ripple
leaving
merely
a
small
depression
where
they
had
stood
well
said
bearwarden
in
all
my
travels
i
never
have
seen
anything
like
this
if
i
were
at
a
performance
and
the
prestidigitateur
after
doing
that
asked
for
my
theory
i
should
say
give
it
up
how
is
it
with
you
doctor
he
asked
addressing
cortlandt
there
must
be
an
explanation
replied
cortlandt
only
we
do
not
know
the
natural
law
to
which
the
phenomenon
is
subject
having
had
no
experience
with
it
on
earth
we
know
that
all
substances
can
be
converted
into
gases
and
that
all
gases
can
be
reduced
to
liquids
and
even
solids
by
the
application
of
pressure
and
cold
if
there
is
any
way
by
which
the
visible
substance
of
these
fungi
can
be
converted
into
its
invisible
gases
as
water
into
oxygen
and
hydrogen
what
we
have
seen
can
be
logically
explained
perhaps
favoured
by
some
affinity
of
the
atmosphere
its
constituent
parts
are
broken
up
and
become
gases
at
this
barometric
pressure
and
temperature
we
must
ask
the
spirit
if
he
visits
us
again
i
wish
he
would
said
ayrault
there
are
lots
of
things
i
should
like
to
ask
him
presidents
of
corporations
and
other
chairmen
said
bearwarden
are
not
usually
superstitious
and
i
of
course
take
no
stock
in
the
supernatural
but
somehow
i
have
a
idea
that
our
friend
the
bishop
with
the
great
power
of
his
mind
over
matter
had
a
hand
in
that
earthquake
he
seems
to
have
an
exalted
idea
of
our
importance
and
may
be
exerting
himself
to
make
things
pleasant
at
this
point
the
sun
sank
below
the
horizon
and
they
found
themselves
confronted
with
night
dear
dear
said
bearwarden
and
we
have
a
crumb
to
eat
i
stand
the
drinks
and
the
pipes
he
continued
passing
around
his
ubiquitous
flask
and
if
i
played
such
pranks
with
my
interior
on
earth
said
cortlandt
helping
himself
to
both
as
i
do
on
this
planet
it
would
give
me
no
end
of
trouble
but
here
i
seem
to
have
the
digestion
of
an
ostrich
so
they
sat
and
smoked
for
an
hour
till
the
stars
twinkled
and
the
rings
shone
in
their
glory
well
said
ayrault
finally
since
we
have
nothing
but
motions
to
lay
on
the
table
i
move
we
adjourn
the
only
motion
i
shall
make
said
cortlandt
who
was
already
undressed
will
be
that
of
getting
into
bed
saying
which
he
rolled
himself
in
his
blanket
and
soon
was
fast
asleep
having
decided
that
on
account
of
the
proximity
of
the
dragons
a
man
must
in
any
event
be
on
the
watch
they
did
not
set
the
from
the
shortness
of
the
nights
they
divided
them
into
only
two
watches
of
from
two
hours
to
two
and
a
half
each
so
that
even
when
constant
watch
duty
was
necessary
each
man
had
one
full
night
sleep
in
three
on
this
occasion
ayrault
and
cortlandt
were
the
watchers
cortlandt
having
the
morning
and
ayrault
the
evening
watch
many
curious
quadruped
birds
about
the
size
of
large
bears
and
similar
in
shape
having
heads
and
several
creatures
that
looked
like
the
dragons
flew
about
them
in
the
moonlight
but
neither
watcher
fired
a
shot
as
the
creatures
showed
no
desire
to
make
an
attack
all
these
species
seemed
to
belong
to
the
owl
or
bat
tribe
for
they
roamed
abroad
at
night
chapter
ayrault
vision
when
ayrault
watch
was
ended
he
roused
cortlandt
who
took
his
place
and
feeling
a
desire
for
solitude
and
for
a
last
long
look
at
the
earth
he
crossed
the
top
of
the
ridge
on
the
slope
of
which
they
had
camped
and
lay
down
on
the
farther
side
the
south
wind
in
the
upper
air
rushed
along
in
the
mighty
whirl
occasionally
carrying
filmy
clouds
across
the
faces
of
the
moons
but
about
ayrault
all
was
still
and
he
felt
a
quiet
and
serene
repose
he
had
every
intention
of
remaining
awake
and
was
pondering
on
the
steadfastness
of
the
human
heart
and
the
constancy
of
love
when
his
meditations
began
to
wander
and
with
his
last
thoughts
on
sylvia
he
fell
asleep
not
a
branch
moved
nor
did
a
leaf
fall
yet
before
ayrault
sleeping
eyes
a
strange
scene
was
enacted
a
figure
in
white
came
near
and
stood
before
him
and
he
recognized
in
it
one
violet
slade
a
very
attractive
girl
to
whom
he
had
been
attentive
in
his
college
days
she
was
at
that
time
just
eighteen
and
people
believed
that
she
loved
him
but
for
some
reason
he
knew
not
why
he
had
not
proposed
i
thought
you
had
died
he
said
as
she
gazed
at
him
but
you
are
now
looking
better
than
ever
from
the
world
point
of
view
i
am
dead
she
replied
i
died
and
was
buried
it
is
therefore
permissible
that
i
should
show
you
the
truth
you
never
believed
i
loved
you
i
have
wished
earnestly
to
see
you
and
to
have
you
know
that
i
did
i
did
you
an
injustice
ayrault
answered
perceiving
all
that
was
in
her
heart
could
mortals
but
see
as
spirits
do
there
would
be
no
misunderstandings
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
she
continued
and
to
know
you
are
well
had
you
not
come
here
we
could
probably
not
have
met
until
after
your
death
for
i
shall
not
be
sufficiently
advanced
to
return
to
earth
for
a
long
time
though
my
greatest
solace
while
there
was
my
religion
which
is
all
that
brought
me
here
we
however
know
that
as
our
capacity
for
true
happiness
increases
we
shall
be
happier
and
that
after
the
resurrection
there
will
be
no
more
tears
farewell
she
whispered
while
her
eyes
were
filled
with
love
ayrault
sleep
was
then
undisturbed
for
some
time
when
suddenly
an
angel
wreathed
in
light
appeared
before
him
and
spoke
these
words
he
that
walked
with
adam
and
talked
with
moses
has
sent
me
to
guard
you
while
you
sleep
no
plague
or
fever
wild
beast
or
earthquake
can
molest
you
for
you
are
equally
protected
from
the
most
powerful
monster
and
the
most
insidious
is
the
man
whose
offences
are
covered
and
whose
sins
are
forgiven
sleep
on
therefore
and
be
refreshed
for
the
body
must
have
rest
a
man
may
rest
indeed
replied
ayrault
when
he
has
a
guardian
angel
i
had
the
most
unbounded
faith
in
your
existence
before
i
saw
you
and
believe
and
know
that
you
or
others
have
often
shielded
me
from
danger
and
saved
my
life
why
am
i
worthy
of
so
much
care
dwelleth
under
the
defence
of
the
most
high
shall
abide
under
the
shadow
of
the
almighty
answered
the
angel
and
thereupon
he
became
invisible
a
diffused
light
taking
his
place
shortly
afterwards
this
paled
and
completely
vanished
not
only
am
i
in
paradise
thought
ayrault
i
believe
i
am
also
in
the
seventh
heaven
would
i
might
hear
such
words
again
a
group
of
lilies
then
appeared
before
the
sleeper
eyes
in
the
midst
was
one
lily
far
larger
than
the
rest
and
of
a
dazzling
white
this
spoke
in
a
gentle
voice
but
with
the
tones
of
a
trombone
thy
thoughts
and
acts
are
a
pleasure
to
me
thou
hast
raised
no
idols
within
thy
heart
and
thy
faith
is
as
incense
before
me
thy
name
is
now
in
the
book
of
life
continue
as
thou
hast
begun
and
thou
shalt
live
and
reign
forever
hereupon
the
earth
shook
and
ayrault
was
awakened
great
boulders
were
rolling
and
crashing
down
the
slope
about
him
while
the
dawn
was
already
in
the
east
my
mortal
eyes
and
senses
are
keener
here
while
i
sleep
than
when
i
wake
he
thought
as
he
looked
about
him
for
spirits
unable
to
affect
me
while
waking
have
made
themselves
felt
in
my
more
sensitive
state
while
i
was
asleep
nevertheless
this
is
none
other
but
the
house
of
god
and
this
is
the
gate
of
heaven
the
boulders
were
still
in
motion
when
i
opened
my
eyes
he
mused
can
it
be
that
there
is
hereabouts
such
a
flower
as
in
my
dreams
i
seemed
to
see
and
looking
beyond
where
his
head
had
lain
he
beheld
the
identical
lily
surrounded
by
the
group
that
his
closed
eyes
had
already
seen
thereupon
he
uncovered
his
head
and
departed
quickly
crossing
the
divide
he
descended
to
camp
where
he
found
cortlandt
in
deep
thought
i
can
not
get
over
the
dreams
said
the
doctor
i
had
in
the
first
part
of
the
night
notwithstanding
yesterday
excitement
and
fatigue
my
sleep
was
most
disturbed
and
i
was
visited
by
visions
of
my
wife
who
died
long
ago
she
warned
me
against
skepticism
and
seemed
much
distressed
at
my
present
spiritual
state
i
said
bearwarden
who
had
been
out
early
and
had
succeeded
in
bringing
in
half
a
dozen
birds
was
so
disturbed
i
could
not
sleep
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
half
the
men
i
have
ever
known
came
and
warned
me
against
agnosticism
and
my
materialistic
tendencies
they
kept
repeating
are
losing
the
reality
for
the
shadow
i
am
convinced
said
ayrault
that
they
were
not
altogether
dreams
or
if
dreams
indeed
that
they
were
superinduced
by
a
higher
will
we
know
that
angels
have
often
appeared
to
men
in
the
past
may
it
not
be
that
as
our
appreciativeness
increases
these
communications
will
recur
thereupon
he
related
his
own
experiences
the
thing
that
surprised
me
said
cortlandt
as
they
finished
breakfast
was
the
extraordinary
realism
of
the
scene
we
must
see
if
our
visions
return
on
anything
but
an
empty
stomach
chapter
vi
a
great
void
and
a
great
longing
resuming
their
march
the
travellers
proceeded
along
the
circumference
of
a
circle
having
a
radius
of
about
three
miles
with
the
callisto
in
the
centre
in
crossing
soft
places
they
observed
forming
in
the
earth
all
around
them
the
impressions
were
of
all
sizes
and
ceased
when
they
reached
rising
or
hard
ground
only
to
reappear
in
the
swamps
regulating
their
speed
by
that
of
the
travellers
the
three
men
were
greatly
surprised
at
this
you
may
observe
said
cortlandt
that
the
surface
of
the
impression
is
depressed
as
you
watch
it
as
though
by
a
weight
and
you
can
see
and
even
hear
the
water
being
squeezed
out
though
whatever
is
doing
it
is
entirely
invisible
they
must
be
made
by
spirits
sufficiently
advanced
to
have
weight
but
not
advanced
enough
to
make
themselves
visible
moved
by
a
species
of
vandalism
bearwarden
raised
his
and
fired
an
ordinary
cartridge
that
he
had
not
prepared
for
the
dragons
at
the
space
directly
over
the
nearest
forming
prints
there
was
a
brilliant
display
of
prismatic
colours
as
in
a
rainbow
and
though
the
impressions
already
made
remained
no
new
ones
were
formed
now
you
have
done
it
said
cortlandt
i
hoped
to
be
able
to
investigate
this
further
we
shall
doubtless
see
other
and
perhaps
more
wonderful
things
replied
bearwarden
i
must
say
this
gives
me
an
uncanny
feeling
when
they
had
completed
a
little
over
half
their
circle
they
came
upon
another
of
the
groves
with
which
saturn
seemed
to
abound
at
the
edge
of
which
in
a
was
a
cave
the
entrance
of
which
was
composed
of
rocky
masses
that
had
apparently
fallen
together
the
floor
being
but
little
higher
than
the
surface
outside
the
arched
roof
of
the
vestibule
was
rendered
watertight
by
the
soil
that
had
formed
upon
it
which
again
was
overgrown
by
vines
and
bushes
this
said
bearwarden
will
be
a
good
place
to
camp
for
the
cave
will
protect
us
from
dragons
unless
they
should
take
a
notion
to
breathe
at
us
from
the
outside
and
it
will
keep
us
dry
in
case
of
rain
we
can
start
with
this
as
a
centre
and
make
another
circuit
we
can
explore
saturn
on
foot
said
cortlandt
and
far
more
thoroughly
than
jupiter
on
account
of
its
comparative
freedom
from
monsters
not
even
the
dragons
can
trouble
us
unless
we
meet
them
in
large
numbers
thereupon
they
set
about
getting
fuel
for
their
fire
besides
collecting
some
of
the
dead
wood
that
was
lying
all
about
they
split
up
a
number
of
resinous
pine
and
fir
trees
with
explosive
bullets
from
their
revolvers
so
that
soon
they
not
only
had
a
roaring
fire
but
filled
the
back
part
of
the
cave
with
logs
to
dry
in
case
they
should
camp
there
again
at
some
later
day
neither
cortlandt
nor
bearwarden
felt
much
like
sleeping
and
so
after
finishing
the
birds
the
president
had
brought
down
that
morning
they
persuaded
ayrault
to
sit
up
and
smoke
with
them
wrapping
themselves
in
their
blankets
for
there
was
a
chill
in
the
air
they
sat
about
the
they
had
built
in
the
mouth
of
the
cave
two
moons
that
were
at
the
full
rose
rapidly
in
the
clear
cold
sky
on
account
of
their
distance
from
the
sun
they
were
less
bright
than
the
terrestrial
moon
but
they
shone
with
a
marvellously
pure
pale
light
the
larger
contained
the
exact
features
of
a
man
there
was
the
somewhat
aquiline
nose
a
and
expressive
mouth
and
large
handsome
eyes
which
were
shaded
by
marked
eyebrows
the
whole
face
was
very
striking
but
was
a
personification
of
the
most
intense
grief
the
expression
was
indeed
sadder
than
that
of
any
face
they
had
ever
seen
the
other
contained
the
profile
of
a
surpassingly
beautiful
young
woman
the
handsome
eyes
shaded
by
lashes
looked
straight
ahead
the
nose
was
perfect
and
the
ear
small
while
the
hair
was
artistically
arranged
at
the
top
and
back
of
the
head
this
moon
also
reflected
a
pure
white
ray
the
former
appeared
about
once
and
a
quarter
the
latter
but
three
quarters
the
size
of
the
terrestrial
moon
and
the
travellers
immediately
recognized
them
by
their
sizes
and
relative
positions
as
tethys
and
dione
discovered
by
cassini
in
march
the
sad
face
was
turned
slightly
towards
that
of
its
companion
and
it
looked
as
if
some
tale
of
the
human
heart
some
romance
had
been
engraved
and
preserved
for
all
time
on
the
features
of
these
dead
bodies
as
they
silently
swung
in
their
orbits
forever
and
anon
were
side
by
side
in
all
the
ages
said
cortlandt
that
these
moons
have
wandered
with
saturn
about
the
sun
and
with
the
solar
system
in
its
journey
through
space
they
can
never
have
gazed
upon
the
scene
they
now
behold
for
we
may
be
convinced
that
no
mortal
man
has
been
here
before
we
may
say
said
ayrault
that
they
see
in
our
bodies
a
type
of
the
source
from
which
come
all
the
spiritual
beings
that
are
here
if
as
the
writers
of
mythology
supposed
replied
cortlandt
inanimate
objects
were
endowed
with
senses
these
moons
would
doubtless
be
unable
to
perceive
the
spiritual
beings
here
for
the
satellites
being
material
should
to
be
consistent
have
only
those
senses
possessed
by
ourselves
so
that
to
them
this
planet
would
ordinarily
appear
deserted
i
shall
be
glad
said
bearwarden
gloomily
when
those
moons
wane
and
are
succeeded
by
their
fellows
for
one
would
give
me
an
attack
of
the
blues
while
the
other
would
subject
me
to
the
inconvenience
of
falling
in
love
as
he
spoke
the
upper
branches
of
the
trees
in
the
grove
began
to
sway
as
a
cold
gust
from
the
north
sighed
among
them
lose
no
more
opportunities
it
seemed
to
cry
for
life
is
short
and
uncertain
soon
you
will
all
be
colder
than
i
and
your
future
still
as
easily
moulded
as
clay
will
be
set
as
marpesian
marble
more
fixed
than
the
hardest
rock
paradise
said
cortlandt
contains
sights
and
sounds
that
might
i
should
think
arouse
sad
reminiscences
without
the
aid
of
the
waters
of
lethe
unless
the
joy
of
its
souls
in
their
new
resources
and
the
sense
of
forgiveness
outweigh
all
else
with
a
parting
look
at
the
refined
silvery
moon
and
its
companion
they
retired
to
the
sheltering
cave
piled
up
the
fire
and
talked
on
for
an
hour
i
do
not
see
how
it
is
said
bearwarden
that
these
moons
considering
their
distance
from
the
sun
and
the
consequently
small
amount
of
light
they
receive
are
so
bright
a
body
brightness
in
reflecting
light
replied
cortlandt
depends
as
much
on
the
colour
and
composition
of
its
own
surface
as
on
the
amount
it
receives
it
is
conceivable
that
these
moons
if
placed
at
the
earth
distance
from
the
sun
would
be
far
brighter
than
our
moon
and
that
our
familiar
satellite
if
removed
to
saturn
would
seem
very
dim
we
know
how
much
more
brilliant
a
mountain
in
the
sunlight
is
when
clad
in
snow
than
when
its
sides
are
bare
these
moons
evidently
reflect
a
large
proportion
of
the
light
they
receive
when
they
came
out
shortly
after
midnight
the
moon
had
already
set
leaving
a
dark
and
dreary
void
in
the
part
of
the
sky
it
had
so
ideally
filled
the
inexpressibly
sad
satellite
on
account
of
its
shorter
distance
and
more
rapid
rate
of
revolution
was
still
above
the
horizon
and
being
slightly
tilted
had
a
more
melancholy
look
than
before
while
they
gazed
sadly
at
the
emptiness
left
by
dione
cortlandt
saw
ayrault
expression
change
and
not
clearly
perceiving
its
cause
said
wishing
to
cheer
him
never
mind
dick
night
we
shall
see
it
again
ah
prosaic
reasoner
retorted
bearwarden
who
saw
that
this
like
so
many
other
things
had
reminded
ayrault
of
sylvia
that
is
but
small
consolation
for
having
lost
it
now
though
i
suppose
our
lot
is
not
so
hard
as
if
we
were
never
to
see
it
again
in
that
moon
face
i
find
the
realization
of
my
fancied
ideal
woman
while
that
sad
one
yonder
seems
as
though
some
celestial
lover
in
search
of
his
fate
had
become
enamoured
of
her
and
tried
in
vain
to
win
her
and
the
grief
in
his
mind
had
impressed
itself
on
the
then
molten
face
of
a
satellite
to
be
the
monument
throughout
eternity
of
love
and
a
broken
heart
if
the
spirits
and
souls
of
the
departed
have
any
command
of
matter
why
may
not
their
intensest
thoughts
engrave
themselves
on
a
moon
that
when
dead
and
frozen
may
reflect
and
shine
as
they
did
while
immersed
in
the
depths
of
space
at
first
dione
bored
me
now
i
should
greatly
like
to
see
her
again
history
repeats
itself
replied
cortlandt
and
the
same
phases
of
life
recur
it
is
we
that
are
in
a
changed
receptive
mood
the
change
that
seems
to
be
in
them
is
in
reality
in
us
remain
as
you
are
now
and
dione
will
give
you
the
same
pleasure
tomorrow
that
she
gave
to
ayrault
this
meant
more
than
the
mere
setting
to
rise
again
of
a
heavenly
body
the
perfume
of
a
flower
the
sighing
of
the
wind
suggesting
some
harmony
or
song
a
full
or
crescent
moon
recalled
thoughts
and
associations
of
sylvia
everything
seemed
to
bring
out
memory
and
he
realized
the
utter
inability
of
absence
to
cure
the
heart
of
love
if
sylvia
should
pass
from
my
life
as
that
moon
has
left
my
vision
his
thoughts
continued
existence
would
be
but
sadness
and
memory
would
be
its
cause
for
the
most
beautiful
sounds
entail
sorrow
the
most
beautiful
sights
intense
pain
ah
he
went
on
with
a
trace
of
bitterness
while
his
friends
fell
asleep
in
the
cave
i
might
better
have
remained
in
love
with
science
for
whose
studies
nature
which
is
but
a
form
of
god
in
the
right
spirit
is
not
dependent
for
his
joy
or
despair
on
the
whims
of
a
girl
she
of
course
sees
many
others
and
being
only
twenty
may
forget
me
must
i
content
myself
with
philosophical
rules
and
mathematical
formulae
when
she
whose
changefulness
i
may
find
greater
than
the
winds
that
sigh
over
me
now
loves
me
no
longer
o
love
which
makes
us
miserable
when
we
feel
it
and
more
miserable
still
when
it
is
gone
he
strung
a
number
of
copper
wires
at
different
degrees
of
tension
between
two
trees
and
listened
to
the
wind
as
it
ranged
up
and
down
on
this
improvised
aeolian
harp
it
gradually
ran
into
a
regular
refrain
which
became
more
and
more
like
words
ayrault
was
puzzled
and
then
amazed
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
you
should
be
happy
it
kept
repeating
you
should
be
happy
in
soft
musical
tones
i
know
i
should
replied
ayrault
finally
recognizing
the
voice
of
violet
slade
in
the
song
of
the
wind
and
i
can
not
understand
why
i
am
not
tell
me
is
this
paradise
violet
or
is
it
not
rather
purgatory
the
notes
ranged
up
and
down
again
and
he
perceived
that
she
was
causing
the
wind
to
blow
as
she
desired
in
other
words
she
was
making
it
play
upon
his
harp
that
depends
on
the
individual
she
replied
it
is
rather
sheol
the
place
of
departed
spirits
those
whose
consciences
made
them
happy
on
earth
are
in
paradise
here
while
those
good
enough
to
reach
heaven
at
last
but
in
whom
some
dross
remains
are
further
refined
in
spirit
and
to
them
it
is
purgatory
those
who
are
in
love
can
be
happy
in
but
one
way
while
their
love
lasts
what
is
happiness
anyway
it
is
the
state
in
which
desires
are
satisfied
my
fair
violet
answered
ayrault
say
rather
the
state
in
which
desire
coincides
with
duty
replied
the
song
for
others
gives
the
truest
joy
being
with
the
object
of
one
love
the
next
you
never
believed
that
i
loved
you
i
dissembled
well
but
you
will
see
for
yourself
some
day
as
clearly
as
i
see
your
love
for
another
now
yes
replied
ayrault
sadly
i
am
in
love
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
there
is
cause
for
my
unrest
and
considering
every
thing
i
should
be
happy
as
man
can
be
yet
mirabile
dictu
i
am
in
hades
in
the
very
depths
your
beloved
is
beyond
my
vision
your
heart
is
all
i
can
see
yet
i
am
convinced
she
will
not
forget
you
i
am
sure
she
loves
you
still
i
have
always
believed
in
homoeopathy
to
the
extent
of
the
similia
similibus
curantur
violet
and
it
is
certain
that
where
nothing
else
will
cure
a
man
of
love
for
one
woman
his
love
for
another
will
you
can
see
how
i
love
sylvia
but
you
have
never
seemed
so
sweet
to
me
as
it
is
a
sacrilege
my
friend
to
speak
so
to
me
now
you
are
done
with
me
forever
i
am
but
a
disembodied
spirit
and
escaped
hades
by
the
grace
of
the
omnipotent
rather
than
by
virtue
of
any
good
i
did
on
earth
so
far
as
any
elasticity
is
left
in
my
opportunities
i
am
dead
as
yon
moon
you
have
still
the
gift
that
but
one
can
give
within
your
animal
body
you
hold
an
immortal
soul
it
is
pliable
as
wax
you
can
mould
it
by
your
will
as
you
shape
that
soul
so
will
your
future
be
it
is
the
ark
that
can
traverse
the
flood
raise
it
and
it
will
raise
you
it
is
all
there
is
in
yourself
preserve
that
gift
and
when
you
die
you
will
i
hope
start
on
a
plane
many
thousands
of
years
in
advance
of
me
there
should
be
no
more
comparison
between
us
than
between
a
person
with
all
his
senses
and
one
that
is
deaf
and
blind
though
you
are
a
layman
you
should
with
your
faith
and
frame
of
mind
soon
be
but
little
behind
our
spiritual
bishop
i
supposed
after
death
a
man
had
rest
is
he
then
a
bishop
still
the
progress
as
he
told
you
is
largely
on
the
old
lines
as
he
stirred
men
hearts
on
earth
he
will
stir
their
souls
in
heaven
and
this
is
no
irksome
or
unwelcome
work
you
say
he
will
do
this
in
heaven
is
he
then
not
there
yet
he
was
not
far
from
heaven
on
earth
yet
technically
none
of
us
can
be
in
heaven
till
after
the
general
resurrection
then
as
we
knew
on
earth
we
shall
receive
bodies
though
as
yet
concerning
their
exact
nature
we
know
but
little
more
than
then
we
are
all
in
sheol
the
just
in
purgatory
and
paradise
the
unjust
in
hell
since
you
are
still
in
purgatory
are
you
unhappy
no
our
state
is
very
happy
all
physical
pain
is
past
and
can
never
be
felt
again
we
know
that
our
evil
desires
are
overcome
and
that
their
imprints
are
being
gradually
erased
i
occasionally
shed
an
intangible
tear
yet
for
most
of
those
who
strove
to
obey
their
consciences
purgatory
when
essential
though
occasionally
giving
us
a
bitter
twinge
is
a
state
not
all
the
glories
imaginable
or
unimaginable
could
make
us
happy
were
our
consciences
ill
at
ease
i
have
advanced
slowly
yet
some
things
are
given
us
at
once
after
i
realized
i
had
irrevocably
lost
your
love
though
for
a
time
i
had
hoped
to
regain
it
i
became
very
restless
earth
seemed
a
prison
and
i
looked
forward
to
death
as
my
deliverer
i
bore
you
no
malice
you
had
never
especially
tried
to
win
me
the
infatuation
that
of
a
girl
of
eighteen
had
been
all
on
my
side
i
lived
five
sad
and
lonely
years
although
as
you
know
i
had
much
attention
people
thought
me
cold
and
heartless
how
could
i
have
a
heart
having
failed
to
win
yours
and
mine
being
broken
having
lost
the
only
man
i
loved
i
knew
no
one
else
could
replace
him
and
i
was
not
the
kind
to
marry
for
pique
people
thought
me
handsome
but
i
felt
myself
aged
when
you
ceased
to
call
perhaps
when
you
and
she
who
holds
all
your
love
come
to
sheol
she
may
spare
you
to
me
a
little
for
as
a
spirit
my
every
thought
is
known
or
perhaps
after
the
resurrection
when
i
too
can
leave
this
planet
we
shall
all
soar
through
space
together
and
we
can
study
the
stars
as
of
old
your
voice
is
a
symphony
sweetest
violet
and
i
love
to
hear
your
words
ah
would
you
could
once
more
return
to
earth
or
that
i
were
an
ethereal
spirit
that
we
might
commune
face
to
face
i
would
follow
you
from
one
end
of
shadowland
to
the
other
of
what
use
is
life
to
me
with
distractions
that
draw
my
thoughts
to
earth
as
gravitation
drew
my
body
i
wish
i
were
a
shade
you
are
talking
for
effect
dick
which
is
useless
here
for
i
see
how
utterly
you
are
in
love
i
am
in
love
violet
and
though
as
i
said
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
sylvia
steadfastness
and
constancy
i
am
very
unhappy
i
have
always
heard
that
time
is
a
balsam
that
cures
all
ills
yet
i
become
more
wretched
every
day
do
all
you
can
to
preserve
that
love
and
it
will
bring
you
joy
all
your
life
your
happiness
is
my
happiness
what
distresses
you
distresses
me
the
tones
here
grew
fainter
and
seemed
about
to
cease
before
you
leave
me
cried
ayrault
tell
me
how
and
when
i
may
see
or
hear
you
again
while
you
remain
on
this
planet
i
shall
be
near
but
beyond
saturn
i
can
not
go
yet
tell
me
violet
how
i
may
see
you
my
love
unattained
you
perceive
makes
me
wretched
while
you
always
gave
me
calm
and
peace
if
i
may
not
kiss
the
hand
i
almost
asked
might
be
mine
let
me
have
but
a
glance
from
your
sweet
eyes
which
will
comfort
me
so
much
now
if
you
break
the
ice
in
the
pool
behind
you
you
shall
see
me
till
the
frame
melts
after
this
the
silence
was
broken
only
by
the
sighing
of
the
wind
in
the
trees
the
pool
had
suddenly
become
covered
with
ice
several
inches
thick
taking
an
axe
ayrault
hewed
out
a
parallelogram
about
three
feet
by
four
and
set
it
on
end
against
the
bank
the
cold
grey
of
morning
was
already
colouring
the
east
and
in
the
growing
light
ayrault
beheld
a
vision
of
violet
within
the
ice
the
face
was
at
about
three
fourths
and
had
a
contemplative
air
the
hair
was
arranged
as
he
had
formerly
seen
it
and
the
thoughtful
look
was
strongest
in
the
beautiful
grey
eyes
which
were
more
serious
than
of
yore
ayrault
stood
riveted
to
the
spot
and
gazed
i
could
have
been
happy
with
her
he
mused
and
to
think
she
is
no
more
as
drops
fell
from
the
ice
tears
rose
to
his
eyes
what
a
pretty
girl
said
bearwarden
to
cortlandt
as
they
came
upon
it
later
in
the
day
the
face
seems
etched
or
imprinted
by
some
peculiar
form
of
freezing
far
within
the
ice
the
next
morning
they
again
set
out
and
so
tramped
hunted
and
investigated
with
varying
success
for
ten
saturnian
days
they
found
that
in
the
animal
and
plant
forms
of
life
nature
had
often
by
some
seeming
accident
struck
out
in
a
course
very
different
from
any
on
the
earth
many
of
the
animals
were
bipeds
and
tripeds
the
latter
arranged
in
tandem
the
last
leg
being
evidently
an
enormously
developed
tail
by
which
the
creature
propelled
itself
as
with
a
spring
the
quadrupeds
had
also
sometimes
wings
and
their
bones
were
hollow
like
those
of
birds
whether
this
great
motive
and
lifting
power
was
the
result
of
the
planet
size
and
the
power
of
gravitation
or
whether
some
creatures
had
in
addition
the
power
of
developing
a
degree
of
apergetic
repulsion
to
offset
it
as
they
suspected
in
the
case
of
the
that
fell
upon
cortlandt
on
jupiter
they
could
not
absolutely
ascertain
life
was
far
less
prolific
on
saturn
than
on
jupiter
doubtless
as
a
result
of
its
greater
distance
from
the
sun
and
of
its
extremes
of
climate
almost
all
organic
life
being
driven
to
the
latitudes
near
the
equator
there
were
as
on
jupiter
many
variations
from
the
forms
of
life
to
which
they
were
accustomed
and
adaptations
to
the
conditions
in
which
they
found
themselves
but
with
the
exception
of
the
strange
manifestations
of
spirit
life
they
found
the
workings
of
the
fundamental
laws
the
same
often
when
they
woke
at
night
the
air
was
luminous
and
they
were
convinced
that
if
they
remained
there
long
enough
it
would
be
easy
to
devise
some
telegraphic
code
of
by
which
they
could
communicate
with
the
spirit
world
and
so
get
ideas
from
the
host
of
spirits
that
had
already
solved
the
problem
of
life
and
death
but
who
were
not
as
yet
sufficiently
developed
to
be
able
to
return
to
the
earth
one
day
they
stopped
to
investigate
what
they
had
supposed
to
be
an
optical
illusion
they
observed
that
leaves
and
other
light
substances
floated
several
inches
above
the
surface
of
the
water
in
the
pools
on
coming
to
the
edge
and
making
tests
they
found
a
light
liquid
as
invisible
as
air
superimposed
upon
the
water
with
sufficient
buoyancy
to
sustain
dry
wood
and
also
some
forms
of
life
they
also
observed
that
insects
coming
close
to
the
surface
and
apparently
inhaling
it
rapidly
increased
in
size
and
weight
from
which
they
concluded
it
must
throw
off
nitrogen
carbon
or
some
other
nourishment
in
the
form
of
gas
the
depth
upon
the
water
was
unaffected
by
rain
which
passed
through
it
but
depended
rather
on
the
condition
of
the
atmosphere
from
which
it
was
evidently
condensed
there
seemed
also
to
be
a
relation
between
the
amount
of
this
liquid
and
the
activity
of
the
spirits
finally
when
their
ammunition
showed
signs
of
running
low
they
decided
to
return
to
the
callisto
go
in
it
to
the
other
side
of
the
planet
and
resume
their
investigations
there
accordingly
they
set
out
to
retrace
their
steps
returning
by
a
course
a
few
miles
to
one
side
of
the
way
they
had
come
and
making
the
cave
their
objective
point
arriving
there
one
evening
about
sunset
they
pitched
their
camp
the
cave
was
sheltered
and
comfortable
and
they
made
preparation
for
passing
the
night
i
shall
be
sorry
said
ayrault
as
they
sat
near
their
fire
to
leave
this
place
without
again
seeing
the
bishop
he
said
we
could
impress
him
anywhere
but
it
may
be
more
difficult
to
do
that
at
the
antipodes
than
here
it
does
seem
said
bearwarden
as
though
we
should
be
missing
it
in
not
seeing
him
again
if
that
is
possible
nothing
but
a
brought
him
the
first
time
and
it
is
not
certain
that
even
in
such
an
emergency
would
he
come
again
uncalled
i
think
said
ayrault
as
none
of
the
spirits
here
are
malevolent
they
would
warn
us
of
danger
if
they
could
the
bishop
spirit
seems
to
have
been
the
only
one
with
sufficiently
developed
power
to
reappear
as
a
man
i
therefore
suggest
that
we
try
to
make
him
feel
our
thought
and
bring
him
to
us
chapter
vii
the
spirit
second
visit
accordingly
the
next
morning
they
concentrated
their
minds
simultaneously
on
the
spirit
wishing
with
all
their
strength
that
he
should
reappear
whether
he
be
far
or
near
said
ayrault
he
must
feel
that
for
we
are
using
the
entire
force
of
our
minds
shadows
began
to
form
and
dancing
prismatic
colours
appeared
but
as
yet
there
was
no
sign
of
the
deceased
bishop
when
suddenly
he
took
shape
among
them
his
appearance
and
disappearance
being
much
like
that
of
stereopticon
views
on
the
sheet
before
a
lantern
he
held
himself
erect
and
his
thoughtful
dignified
face
had
the
same
calm
expression
it
had
worn
before
we
attracted
your
attention
said
ayrault
in
the
way
you
said
we
might
because
we
longed
so
to
see
you
yes
added
bearwarden
and
cortlandt
we
felt
we
must
see
you
again
i
am
always
at
your
service
replied
the
spirit
and
will
answer
your
questions
with
regard
to
my
visibility
and
invisibility
he
continued
with
a
smile
for
i
will
not
wait
for
you
to
ask
the
explanation
of
what
is
in
your
minds
it
is
very
simple
a
man
soul
can
never
die
a
manifestation
of
the
soul
is
the
spirit
this
has
entity
consciousness
and
will
and
these
also
live
forever
as
in
the
natural
or
material
life
as
i
shall
call
it
will
affects
the
material
first
thus
a
child
has
power
to
move
its
hand
or
a
material
object
as
a
toy
before
it
can
become
the
medium
in
a
psychological
seance
so
it
is
here
before
becoming
visible
to
your
eyes
i
by
my
will
draw
certain
material
substances
in
the
form
of
gases
from
the
ground
water
or
air
around
me
these
take
any
shape
i
wish
not
necessarily
that
of
man
though
it
is
more
natural
to
appear
as
we
did
on
earth
and
may
absorb
a
portion
of
light
and
so
be
able
to
cast
a
shadow
or
break
up
the
white
rays
into
prismatic
colours
or
they
may
be
wholly
invisible
by
an
effort
of
the
will
then
i
combine
and
condense
these
gases
which
consist
principally
of
oxygen
hydrogen
nitrogen
and
carbon
into
flesh
blood
water
or
anything
else
you
have
already
learned
on
earth
that
by
the
application
of
heat
every
solid
and
every
liquid
substance
which
is
solid
or
liquid
simply
because
of
the
temperature
at
which
you
find
it
can
be
expanded
into
gas
or
gases
and
that
by
cold
and
pressure
every
gas
can
be
reduced
to
a
liquid
or
a
solid
on
earth
the
state
of
a
substance
whether
solid
liquid
or
gaseous
depends
simply
upon
those
two
conditions
here
neither
thermal
nor
barometric
changes
are
required
for
by
mastering
the
new
natural
laws
that
at
death
become
patent
to
our
senses
we
have
all
the
necessary
control
it
requires
but
an
effort
of
my
will
to
be
almost
instantly
clothed
in
human
form
and
but
another
effort
to
rearrange
the
molecules
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
the
envelope
visible
some
who
have
been
dead
longer
or
had
a
greater
natural
aptitude
than
i
have
advanced
further
and
all
are
learning
but
the
difference
in
the
rate
at
which
spirits
acquire
control
of
previously
unknown
natural
laws
varies
far
more
than
among
individuals
on
earth
these
forms
of
organic
life
do
not
disintegrate
till
after
death
here
in
the
natural
state
they
break
down
and
dissolve
into
their
structural
elements
in
full
bloom
as
was
done
by
the
fungi
the
poisonous
element
in
the
deadly
gust
against
which
i
warned
you
came
from
the
gaseous
ingredients
of
toadstools
which
but
seldom
and
then
only
when
the
atmosphere
has
the
greatest
affinity
for
them
dissolve
automatically
producing
a
wave
against
which
your
meteorological
instruments
in
future
can
warn
you
the
slight
fall
you
noticed
in
temperature
was
because
the
specific
heat
of
these
gases
is
high
and
to
become
gas
while
in
the
solid
state
they
had
to
withdraw
some
warmth
from
the
air
the
fatal
breath
of
the
winged
lizards
or
dragons
as
you
call
them
results
from
the
same
cause
the
action
of
their
digestion
breaking
up
the
fungus
which
does
not
kill
them
because
they
exhale
the
poisonous
part
in
gaseous
form
with
their
breath
the
mushrooms
dissolve
more
easily
the
natural
separation
that
takes
place
as
they
reach
a
certain
stage
in
their
development
being
precipitated
by
concussion
or
shock
having
seen
that
as
on
earth
we
gain
control
of
the
material
first
our
acquisitiveness
then
extends
to
a
better
understanding
and
appreciation
of
our
new
senses
and
we
are
continually
finding
new
objects
of
beauty
and
new
beauties
in
things
we
supposed
we
already
understood
we
were
accustomed
on
earth
to
the
marvellous
variety
that
nature
produced
from
apparently
simple
means
and
presented
to
our
very
limited
senses
here
there
is
an
indescribably
greater
variety
to
be
examined
by
vastly
keener
senses
the
souls
in
hell
have
an
equally
keen
but
distorted
counterpart
of
our
senses
so
that
they
see
in
a
magnified
form
everything
vile
in
themselves
and
in
each
other
to
their
senses
only
the
ugly
and
hateful
side
is
visible
so
that
the
beauty
and
perfume
of
a
flower
are
to
them
as
loathsome
as
the
appearance
and
fumes
of
a
toadstool
as
evolution
and
the
tendency
of
everything
to
perpetuate
itself
and
intensify
its
peculiarities
are
invariable
throughout
the
universe
these
unhappy
souls
and
ourselves
seem
destined
to
diverge
more
and
more
as
time
goes
on
and
while
we
constantly
become
happier
as
our
capacity
for
happiness
increases
their
sharpening
senses
will
give
them
a
worse
and
worse
idea
of
each
other
till
their
mutual
repugnance
will
know
no
bounds
and
of
everything
concerning
which
they
obtain
knowledge
through
their
senses
thus
these
poor
creatures
seem
to
be
the
victims
of
circumstances
and
the
unalterable
laws
of
fate
and
were
there
such
a
thing
as
death
their
misery
would
unquestionably
finally
break
their
hearts
that
there
will
be
final
forgiveness
for
the
condemned
has
long
been
a
human
hope
but
as
yet
they
have
experienced
none
and
there
is
no
analogy
for
it
in
nature
but
while
you
have
still
your
earthly
bodies
and
the
opportunities
they
give
you
of
serving
god
you
need
not
be
concerned
about
hell
no
one
on
earth
knowing
how
things
really
are
would
ever
again
forsake
his
ways
the
earthly
state
is
the
most
precious
opportunity
of
securing
that
for
which
a
man
would
give
his
all
even
from
the
most
worldly
point
of
view
a
man
is
an
unspeakable
fool
not
to
improve
his
talents
and
do
good
what
would
those
in
sheol
not
give
now
for
but
one
day
in
the
flesh
on
earth
of
which
you
unappreciatives
may
still
have
so
many
the
opportunities
of
even
one
hour
might
bring
joy
to
those
in
paradise
forever
and
greatly
ease
the
lot
of
those
in
hell
in
doing
acts
of
philanthropy
however
you
must
remember
the
text
of
the
sermon
the
doctor
of
divinity
preached
to
craniner
and
ridley
just
before
they
perished
at
the
stake
i
give
my
body
to
be
burned
and
have
not
charity
it
profiteth
me
nothing
which
shows
that
even
good
deeds
must
be
performed
in
the
proper
spirit
a
new
era
is
soon
to
dawn
on
earth
notwithstanding
your
great
material
progress
the
future
will
exceed
all
the
past
man
will
find
every
substance
maximum
use
thereby
vastly
increasing
his
comfort
then
when
advanced
in
science
and
reason
with
the
power
of
his
senses
increased
by
the
delicate
instruments
that
you
as
the
forerunners
of
the
coming
man
are
already
learning
to
make
may
he
cease
to
be
a
groveller
like
our
progenitors
the
quadrupeds
and
may
his
thoughts
rise
to
his
creator
who
has
brought
him
to
such
heights
through
all
the
intricacies
of
the
way
your
preparation
for
the
life
to
come
can
also
be
greatly
aided
by
intercourse
with
those
who
have
already
died
when
you
really
want
to
associate
spiritually
with
us
you
can
do
so
for
though
perhaps
only
one
in
a
hundred
million
can
like
me
so
clothe
himself
as
to
be
again
visible
to
mortal
eyes
many
of
us
could
affect
gelatine
or
extremely
sensitive
plates
that
would
show
interruptions
in
the
chemical
rays
that
like
the
thermal
red
beyond
the
visible
spectroscope
you
know
exist
though
you
can
neither
see
nor
feel
them
spirits
could
not
affect
the
magnetic
eye
because
magnetism
though
immaterial
itself
is
induced
and
affected
only
by
a
material
substance
the
impression
on
the
plate
however
like
the
prismatic
colours
you
have
already
noticed
can
be
produced
by
a
slight
rarefaction
of
the
hydrogen
in
the
air
so
that
though
no
spirit
could
be
photographed
as
such
a
code
and
language
might
be
established
by
means
of
the
effect
produced
on
the
air
by
the
spirit
mind
i
am
so
interested
in
the
subject
of
my
disquisition
that
i
had
almost
forgotten
that
your
spirits
are
still
subject
to
the
requirements
of
the
body
last
time
i
dined
with
you
let
me
now
play
the
host
we
shall
be
charmed
to
dine
with
you
said
ayrault
and
shall
be
only
too
glad
of
anything
that
will
keep
you
with
us
then
said
the
spirit
as
the
tablecloth
is
laid
we
need
only
to
have
something
on
it
let
each
please
hold
a
corner
he
continued
taking
one
himself
with
his
left
hand
while
he
passed
his
right
to
his
brow
soon
flakes
as
of
snow
began
to
form
in
the
air
above
and
slowly
descended
upon
the
cloth
and
glancing
up
the
three
men
saw
that
for
a
considerable
height
this
process
was
going
on
the
flakes
increasing
in
size
as
they
fell
till
they
attained
a
length
of
several
inches
when
there
was
enough
for
them
all
on
the
the
shower
ceased
sitting
down
on
the
ground
they
began
to
eat
this
manna
which
had
a
delicious
flavour
and
marvellous
purity
and
freshness
as
you
doubtless
have
already
suspected
said
the
spirit
the
basis
of
this
in
every
case
is
carbon
combined
with
nitrogen
in
its
solid
form
and
with
the
other
gases
the
atmosphere
here
contains
you
may
notice
that
the
flakes
vary
in
colour
as
well
as
in
taste
both
of
which
are
of
course
governed
by
the
gas
with
which
the
carbon
also
in
its
visible
form
is
combined
it
is
almost
the
same
process
as
that
performed
by
every
plant
in
withdrawing
carbon
from
the
air
and
storing
it
in
its
trunk
in
the
form
of
wood
which
as
charcoal
is
again
almost
pure
carbon
only
in
this
case
the
metamorphosis
is
far
more
rapid
this
is
perhaps
the
natural
law
that
elijah
by
god
aid
invoked
in
the
miracle
of
the
widow
cruse
and
that
produced
the
manna
that
fed
the
israelites
in
the
desert
while
apergy
came
in
play
in
the
case
of
the
stream
that
moses
called
from
the
rock
in
the
wilderness
which
followed
the
descendants
of
abraham
over
the
rough
country
through
which
they
passed
in
examining
miracles
with
the
utmost
deference
as
we
have
a
right
to
we
see
one
law
running
through
all
even
in
christ
miracle
of
changing
the
water
to
wine
there
was
a
natural
law
though
only
one
has
dwelt
on
earth
who
could
make
that
change
which
from
a
chemist
standpoint
was
peculiarly
difficult
on
account
of
the
required
fermentation
which
is
the
result
of
a
developed
and
matured
germ
many
of
his
miracles
however
are
as
far
beyond
my
small
power
as
heaven
is
above
the
earth
much
of
the
substance
of
the
loaves
and
fishes
with
which
he
fed
the
multitude
the
carbon
and
nitrogenous
products
also
came
from
the
air
though
he
could
have
taken
them
from
many
other
sources
the
combination
and
building
up
of
these
in
the
ordinary
way
would
have
taken
weeks
or
months
but
was
performed
instantaneously
by
his
mighty
power
what
natural
laws
are
known
to
you
asked
bearwarden
that
we
do
not
understand
or
concerning
the
existence
of
which
we
are
ignorant
most
of
the
laws
in
the
invisible
world
said
the
spirit
are
the
counterpart
or
extension
of
laws
that
appear
on
earth
though
you
as
yet
understand
but
a
small
part
of
those
many
not
having
come
to
your
notice
you
for
instance
know
that
light
heat
and
motion
are
analogous
and
either
of
the
last
two
can
be
converted
into
the
other
but
in
practice
you
produce
motion
of
the
water
molecules
by
the
application
of
heat
and
seldom
reverse
it
one
of
the
first
things
we
master
here
is
the
power
to
freeze
or
boil
water
by
checking
the
motion
of
the
molecules
in
one
case
and
by
increasing
it
and
their
mutual
repulsion
in
the
other
this
is
by
virtue
of
a
simple
law
though
in
this
case
there
is
no
natural
manifestation
of
it
on
earth
with
which
to
compare
it
while
knowledge
must
be
acquired
here
through
study
as
on
earth
the
new
senses
we
receive
with
the
awakening
from
death
render
the
doing
so
easy
though
with
only
the
senses
we
had
before
it
would
have
been
next
to
impossible
at
this
moment
snow
is
falling
on
the
callisto
but
this
you
could
not
know
by
seeing
and
scarcely
any
degree
of
evolution
could
develop
your
sight
sufficiently
unassisted
by
death
with
your
instruments
however
you
could
already
perceive
it
notwithstanding
the
intervening
rocks
your
research
on
earth
is
the
best
and
most
thorough
in
the
history
of
the
race
and
could
we
but
give
you
suggestions
as
to
the
direction
in
which
to
push
it
the
difference
between
yourselves
and
angels
might
be
but
little
more
than
that
between
the
number
and
intensity
of
the
senses
and
the
composition
of
the
body
by
the
combination
of
natural
laws
you
have
rid
yourselves
of
the
impediment
of
material
weight
and
can
roam
through
space
like
spirits
or
as
columbus
by
virtue
of
the
confidence
that
came
with
the
discovery
of
the
mariner
compass
roamed
upon
and
explored
the
sea
you
have
made
a
good
beginning
and
were
not
your
lives
so
short
and
their
requirements
so
peremptory
you
might
visit
the
distant
stars
i
will
show
you
the
working
of
evolution
life
sleeps
in
minerals
dreams
in
plants
and
wakes
in
you
the
rock
worn
by
frost
and
age
crumbles
to
earth
and
soil
this
enters
the
substance
of
the
primordial
plant
which
slowly
rising
produces
the
animal
germ
after
that
the
way
is
clear
and
man
is
evolved
from
protoplasm
through
the
vertebrate
and
the
ape
here
we
have
the
epitome
of
the
struggle
for
life
in
the
ages
past
and
the
analogue
of
the
journey
in
the
years
to
come
does
not
the
almighty
himself
make
this
clear
where
he
says
through
his
servant
isaiah
of
these
stones
will
i
raise
up
children
and
the
name
adam
means
red
earth
god
having
brought
man
so
far
will
not
let
evolution
cease
and
the
next
stage
of
life
must
be
the
spiritual
can
you
tell
us
anything
asked
ayrault
concerning
the
bodies
that
those
surviving
the
final
judgment
will
receive
notwithstanding
the
unfolding
of
knowledge
that
has
come
to
us
here
replied
the
spirit
there
are
still
some
subjects
concerning
which
we
must
look
for
information
to
the
inspired
writers
in
the
bible
and
every
gain
or
discovery
goes
to
prove
their
veracity
we
know
that
there
are
celestial
bodies
and
bodies
terrestrial
and
that
the
spiritual
bodies
we
shall
receive
in
the
resurrection
will
have
power
and
will
be
incorruptible
and
immortal
we
also
know
by
analogy
and
reason
that
they
will
be
unaffected
by
the
cold
and
void
of
space
so
that
their
possessors
can
range
through
the
universe
for
and
decillions
of
miles
that
they
will
have
marvellous
capacities
for
enjoying
what
they
find
and
that
no
undertaking
or
journey
will
be
too
difficult
though
it
be
to
the
centre
of
the
sun
though
many
of
us
can
already
visit
the
remote
regions
of
space
as
spirits
none
can
as
yet
see
god
but
we
know
that
as
the
sight
we
are
to
receive
with
our
new
bodies
sharpens
the
pure
in
heart
will
see
him
though
he
is
still
as
invisible
to
the
eyes
of
the
most
developed
here
as
the
ether
of
space
is
to
yours
chapter

cassandra
and
cosmology
the
being
empty
ayrault
took
it
up
and
crossing
the
ridge
of
a
small
hill
descended
to
a
he
had
filled
it
and
was
straightening
himself
when
the
stone
on
which
he
stood
turned
and
he
might
have
fallen
had
not
the
bishop
of
whose
presence
he
had
been
unaware
stretched
out
his
hand
and
upheld
him
i
thought
you
might
need
a
little
help
he
said
with
a
smile
and
so
walked
beside
you
though
you
knew
it
not
water
is
heavy
and
you
may
not
yet
have
become
accustomed
to
its
saturnian
weight
many
thanks
my
master
replied
ayrault
retaining
his
hand
were
it
not
that
i
am
engaged
to
the
girl
i
love
and
am
sometimes
haunted
by
the
thought
that
in
my
absence
she
may
be
forgetting
me
i
should
wish
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
natural
life
here
unless
i
could
persuade
you
to
go
with
me
to
the
earth
by
remaining
here
replied
the
spirit
with
a
sad
look
you
would
be
losing
the
most
priceless
opportunities
of
doing
good
neither
will
i
go
with
you
but
as
your
distress
is
real
i
will
tell
you
of
anything
happening
on
earth
that
you
wish
to
know
tell
me
then
what
the
person
now
in
my
thoughts
is
doing
she
is
standing
in
a
window
facing
west
watering
some
with
a
small
silver
sprinkler
which
has
a
ruby
in
the
handle
can
you
see
anything
else
beneath
the
jewel
is
an
inscription
that
runs
those
who
in
warm
july
are
born
a
single
ruby
should
be
worn
then
will
they
be
exempt
and
free
from
love
doubts
and
anxiety
marvellous
had
i
any
doubts
as
to
your
prescience
and
power
they
would
be
dispelled
now
one
thing
more
let
me
ask
however
does
she
still
love
me
in
her
mind
is
but
one
thought
and
in
her
heart
is
an
image
that
of
the
man
before
me
she
loves
you
with
all
her
soul
my
most
eager
wish
is
satisfied
and
for
the
moment
my
heart
is
at
rest
replied
ayrault
as
they
turned
their
steps
towards
camp
yet
such
is
my
weakness
by
nature
that
ere
hours
have
passed
i
shall
long
to
have
you
tell
me
again
i
have
been
in
love
myself
replied
the
spirit
and
know
the
feeling
yet
to
be
of
the
smallest
service
to
you
gives
me
far
more
happiness
than
it
can
give
you
the
mutual
love
in
paradise
exceeds
even
the
lover
love
on
earth
for
it
is
only
those
that
loved
and
can
love
that
are
blessed
you
can
hardly
realize
the
bishop
continued
as
they
rejoined
bearwarden
and
cortlandt
the
joy
that
a
spirit
in
paradise
experiences
when
on
reopening
his
eyes
after
passing
death
which
is
but
the
portal
he
finds
himself
endowed
with
sight
that
enables
him
to
see
such
distances
and
with
such
distinctness
the
solar
system
with
this
ringed
planet
its
swarm
of
asteroids
and
its
planets
one
of
which
vulcan
you
have
already
discovered
is
a
beautiful
sight
the
planets
nearest
the
sun
receive
such
burning
rays
that
their
surfaces
are
and
at
the
equator
at
perihelion
are
molten
these
are
not
seen
from
the
earth
because
rising
or
setting
almost
simultaneously
with
the
sun
they
are
lost
in
its
rays
the
great
planet
beyond
neptune
orbit
is
perhaps
the
most
interesting
this
we
call
cassandra
because
it
would
be
a
prophet
of
evil
to
any
visitor
from
the
stars
who
should
judge
the
solar
system
by
it
this
planet
is
nearly
as
large
as
jupiter
being
miles
in
diameter
but
has
a
specific
gravity
lighter
than
saturn
bode
law
you
know
says
write
down
add
to
each
and
get
and
this
series
of
numbers
represents
very
nearly
the
relative
distances
of
the
planets
from
the
sun
according
to
this
law
you
would
expect
the
planet
next
beyond
neptune
to
be
about
miles
from
the
sun
but
it
is
about
so
that
there
is
a
gap
between
neptune
and
cassandra
as
between
mars
and
jupiter
except
that
in
cassandra
case
there
are
no
asteroids
to
show
where
any
planet
was
we
must
then
suppose
it
is
an
exception
to
bode
law
or
that
there
was
a
planet
that
has
completely
disappeared
as
cassandra
would
be
within
the
law
if
there
had
been
an
intermediary
planet
we
have
good
prima
facie
reason
for
believing
that
it
existed
cassandra
takes
in
round
numbers
a
thousand
years
to
complete
its
orbit
and
from
it
the
sun
though
brighter
appears
no
larger
than
the
earth
evening
or
morning
star
cassandra
has
also
three
large
moons
but
these
when
full
shine
with
a
light
like
the
old
moon
in
the
new
moon
arms
in
that
terrestrial
phenomenon
when
the
earth
by
reflecting
the
crescent
light
and
that
of
the
sun
makes
the
dark
part
visible
the
temperature
at
cassandra
surface
is
but
little
above
the
cold
of
space
and
no
water
exists
in
the
liquid
state
it
being
as
much
a
solid
as
aluminum
or
glass
there
are
rivers
and
lakes
but
these
consist
of
liquefied
hydrogen
and
other
gases
the
heavier
liquid
collected
in
deep
places
and
the
lighter
with
less
than
half
the
specific
gravity
of
ether
floating
upon
it
without
mixing
as
oil
on
water
when
the
heavier
penetrates
to
a
sufficient
depth
the
interior
being
still
warm
it
is
converted
into
gas
and
driven
back
to
the
surface
only
to
be
recondensed
on
reaching
the
upper
air
thus
it
may
happen
that
two
rains
composed
of
separate
liquids
may
fall
together
there
being
but
little
of
any
other
atmosphere
much
of
it
consists
of
what
you
might
call
the
vapour
of
hydrogen
and
many
of
the
gases
and
liquids
on
earth
exist
only
as
liquids
and
solids
so
that
were
there
mortal
inhabitants
on
cassandra
they
might
build
their
houses
of
blocks
of
oxygen
or
chlorine
as
you
do
of
limestone
or
marble
and
use
ice
that
never
melts
in
place
of
glass
for
transparence
they
would
also
use
mercury
for
bullets
in
their
rifles
just
as
inhabitants
of
the
planets
at
the
other
extreme
might
if
their
bodies
consisted
of
asbestos
or
were
in
any
other
way
constituted
bathe
in
tin
lead
or
even
zinc
which
ordinarily
exist
in
the
liquid
state
as
water
and
mercury
do
on
the
earth
though
cassandra
atmosphere
such
as
it
is
is
mostly
clear
for
the
evaporation
from
the
rivers
and
icy
mediterraneans
is
slight
the
brightness
of
even
the
highest
noon
is
less
than
an
earthly
twilight
and
the
stars
never
cease
to
shine
the
dark
base
of
the
rocky
cliffs
is
washed
by
the
frigid
tide
but
there
is
scarcely
a
sound
for
the
pebbles
can
not
be
moved
by
the
weightless
waves
and
an
occasional
murmur
is
all
that
is
heard
great
rocks
of
ice
reflect
the
light
of
the
grey
moons
and
never
a
leaf
falls
or
a
bird
sings
with
the
exception
of
the
mournful
ripples
the
planet
is
silent
as
the
grave
the
animal
and
plant
kingdoms
do
not
exist
only
the
mineral
and
spiritual
worlds
i
say
spiritual
because
there
are
souls
upon
it
but
it
is
the
home
of
the
condemned
in
hell
here
dwell
the
transgressors
who
died
unrepentant
and
those
who
were
not
saved
by
faith
this
is
the
one
instance
in
which
i
do
not
enjoy
my
developed
sight
for
i
sometimes
glance
in
their
direction
and
the
vision
that
meets
me
as
my
eyes
focus
distresses
my
soul
their
senses
are
like
an
imperfect
mirror
magnifying
all
that
is
bad
in
one
another
and
distorting
anything
still
partially
good
when
that
exists
all
those
things
that
might
at
least
distract
them
are
hollow
their
misery
being
the
inevitable
result
of
the
condition
of
mind
to
which
they
became
accustomed
on
earth
and
which
brought
them
to
cassandra
but
let
us
turn
to
something
brighter
though
the
solar
system
may
seem
complex
the
sun
is
but
a
star
among
the
millions
in
the
milky
way
and
compared
with
the
planetary
systems
of
sirius
the
stars
of
the
southern
cross
and
the
motions
of
the
nebula
it
is
simplicity
itself
compared
with
the
splendour
of
sirius
with
its
diameter
of
twelve
million
miles
the
sun
measuring
but
eight
hundred
and
forty
thousand
becomes
insignificant
and
this
giant
system
includes
groups
and
clusters
of
planets
many
with
three
times
the
mass
of
jupiter
five
and
six
together
each
a
different
colour
revolving
about
a
common
centre
while
they
swing
about
their
primary
their
numerous
moons
have
satellites
encircling
them
with
orbits
in
some
cases
at
right
angles
to
the
plane
of
the
ecliptic
so
that
they
shine
perpendicularly
on
what
correspond
to
the
arctic
and
antarctic
regions
while
their
axes
are
so
inclined
that
the
satellites
turn
a
complete
somersault
at
each
revolution
producing
glistening
effects
of
ice
and
snow
at
the
poles
some
of
the
moons
are
at
a
red
or
white
heat
and
so
prevent
the
chill
of
night
on
the
planets
while
they
shine
with
more
than
reflected
light
in
addition
to
the
five
or
six
large
planets
in
each
group
which
however
are
many
millions
of
miles
apart
there
is
in
some
clusters
a
small
planet
that
swings
backward
and
forward
across
the
common
centre
like
a
pendulum
but
in
nearly
a
straight
line
and
while
this
multiplicity
of
motion
goes
on
the
whole
aggregation
sweeps
majestically
around
sirius
its
mighty
sun
our
little
solar
system
contains
as
we
know
about
one
thousand
planets
satellites
and
asteroids
large
enough
to
be
dignified
by
the
name
of
heavenly
bodies
vast
numbers
of
the
stars
have
a
hundred
and
even
a
thousand
times
the
mass
of
our
sun
and
their
systems
being
relatively
as
complex
as
ours
in
some
cases
even
more
so
they
contain
a
hundred
thousand
or
a
million
individual
bodies
over
sixty
million
bright
or
incandescent
stars
were
visible
to
the
terrestrial
telescopes
a
hundred
years
ago
the
average
size
of
which
far
exceeds
our
sun
to
the
magnificent
telescopes
of
they
are
literally
countless
and
the
number
can
be
indefinitely
extended
as
your
optical
resources
grow
yet
the
number
of
stars
you
see
is
utterly
insignificant
compared
with
the
cold
and
dark
ones
you
can
not
see
but
concerning
which
you
are
constantly
learning
more
by
observing
their
effect
on
the
bright
ones
both
by
perturbing
them
and
by
obscuring
their
rays
occasionally
as
you
know
a
star
of
the
twelfth
or
fifteenth
magnitude
or
one
that
has
been
invisible
flares
up
for
several
months
to
the
fourth
or
fifth
through
a
collision
with
some
dark
giant
and
then
returns
to
what
it
was
in
the
beginning
a
gaseous
filmy
nebula
these
innumerable
hosts
of
dark
monsters
though
dead
are
centres
of
systems
like
most
of
the
stars
you
can
see
a
slight
consideration
of
these
figures
will
show
that
notwithstanding
the
number
of
souls
the
creator
has
given
life
on
earth
each
one
might
in
fact
have
a
system
to
himself
and
that
however
long
the
little
globe
may
remain
as
it
were
a
mint
in
which
souls
are
tried
by
fire
and
moulded
and
receive
their
final
stamp
they
will
always
have
room
to
circulate
and
will
be
prized
according
to
the
impress
their
faces
or
hearts
must
show
but
sirius
itself
is
moving
many
times
faster
than
the
swiftest
cannon
ball
carrying
its
system
with
it
and
i
see
you
asking
what
does
all
this
motion
tend
i
will
show
you
many
quadrillions
of
miles
away
so
far
that
your
most
powerful
telescopes
have
not
yet
caught
a
glimmer
rests
in
its
serene
grandeur
a
star
that
we
call
cosmos
because
it
is
the
centre
of
this
universe
its
diameter
is
as
great
as
the
diameter
of
cassandra
orbit
and
notwithstanding
its
terrific
heat
its
specific
gravity
on
account
of
the
irresistible
pressure
at
and
near
the
centre
is
as
great
as
that
of
the
planet
mercury
this
holds
all
that
your
eyes
or
mine
can
see
and
the
motions
of
the
stars
for
we
know
that
sirius
among
others
is
receding
is
but
the
difference
in
the
rate
at
which
the
different
systems
and
constellations
swing
around
cosmos
though
in
doing
so
they
often
revolve
about
other
systems
or
swing
round
common
centres
so
that
many
are
satellites
of
satellites
many
times
repeated
the
orbits
of
some
are
circular
and
of
others
elliptical
as
those
of
comets
and
some
revolve
about
each
other
or
as
we
have
seen
about
a
common
point
while
they
perform
their
celestial
journey
a
star
therefore
recedes
or
advances
as
jupiter
and
venus
with
relation
to
the
earth
the
planet
in
the
smaller
orbit
moves
faster
than
that
in
the
larger
so
that
the
intervening
distances
wax
and
wane
though
all
are
going
in
the
same
general
direction
in
the
case
of
the
members
of
the
solar
system
astronomical
record
can
tell
when
even
a
most
distant
known
planet
has
been
in
opposition
or
conjunction
but
the
earth
has
scarcely
been
habitable
since
the
sun
was
last
in
its
present
position
in
its
orbit
around
cosmos
the
curve
that
our
system
follows
is
of
such
radius
that
it
would
require
the
most
precise
observations
for
centuries
to
show
that
it
was
not
a
straight
line
we
call
this
the
universe
because
it
is
all
that
the
clearest
eyes
or
telescopes
have
been
able
to
see
but
it
is
only
a
subdivision
in
fact
but
a
system
on
a
vaster
scale
than
that
of
the
sun
or
of
sirius
far
beyond
this
visible
universe
my
intuition
tells
me
are
other
systems
more
gigantic
than
this
and
entirely
different
in
many
respects
even
the
effects
of
gravitation
are
modified
by
the
changed
condition
for
these
systems
are
spread
out
flat
like
the
rings
of
this
planet
and
the
ether
of
space
is
luminous
instead
of
black
as
here
these
systems
are
but
in
a
later
stage
of
development
than
ours
and
in
the
course
of
evolution
our
visible
universe
will
be
changed
in
the
same
way
as
i
can
explain
in
incalculable
ages
the
forward
motion
of
the
planets
and
their
satellites
will
be
checked
by
the
resistance
of
the
ether
of
space
and
the
meteorites
and
solid
matter
they
encounter
meteorites
also
overtake
them
and
by
striking
them
as
it
were
in
the
rear
propel
them
but
more
are
encountered
in
front
an
illustration
of
which
you
can
have
by
walking
rapidly
or
riding
on
horseback
on
a
rainy
day
in
which
case
more
drops
will
strike
your
chest
than
your
back
the
same
rule
applies
to
bodies
in
space
while
the
meteorites
encountered
have
more
effect
than
those
following
since
in
one
case
it
is
the
speed
of
the
meteor
minus
that
of
the
planet
and
in
the
other
the
sum
of
the
two
velocities
with
this
checking
of
the
forward
motion
the
centrifugal
force
decreases
and
the
attraction
of
the
central
body
has
more
effect
when
this
takes
place
the
planet
or
satellite
falls
slightly
towards
the
body
around
which
it
revolves
thereby
increasing
its
speed
till
the
centrifugal
force
again
balances
the
centripetal
this
would
seem
to
make
it
descend
by
fits
and
starts
but
in
reality
the
approach
is
nearly
constant
so
that
the
orbits
are
in
fact
slightly
spiral
what
is
true
of
the
planets
and
satellites
is
also
true
of
the
stars
with
reference
to
cosmos
though
many
even
of
these
have
subordinate
motions
in
their
great
journey
though
the
satellites
of
the
moons
revolve
about
the
primaries
in
orbits
inclined
at
all
kinds
of
angles
to
the
planes
of
the
ecliptics
and
even
the
moons
vary
in
their
paths
about
the
planets
the
planets
themselves
revolve
about
the
stars
like
those
of
this
system
about
the
sun
in
substantially
the
same
plane
and
what
is
true
of
the
planets
is
even
more
true
of
the
stars
in
their
orbits
about
cosmos
so
that
when
after
incalculable
ages
they
do
fall
they
strike
this
monster
sun
at
or
near
its
equator
and
not
falling
perpendicularly
but
in
a
line
varying
but
slightly
from
a
tangent
and
at
terrific
speed
they
cause
the
colossus
to
rotate
more
and
more
rapidly
on
its
own
axis
till
it
must
become
greatly
flattened
at
the
poles
as
the
earth
is
slightly
and
as
jupiter
and
saturn
are
a
good
deal
even
though
not
all
the
stars
are
exactly
in
the
plane
of
cosmos
equator
as
you
can
see
they
are
not
there
are
as
many
above
as
below
it
so
that
the
general
average
will
be
there
and
as
all
are
moving
in
the
same
direction
it
is
not
necessary
for
all
to
strike
the
same
line
those
striking
nearer
the
poles
where
the
circles
are
smaller
and
where
the
surface
is
not
being
carried
forward
so
fast
by
the
giant
rotation
will
have
even
more
effect
in
increasing
its
speed
since
it
will
be
like
attaching
the
of
a
locomotive
near
the
axle
instead
of
near
the
circumference
and
with
enough
power
will
produce
even
greater
results
as
cosmos
waxes
greater
from
the
result
of
these
continual
accretions
its
attraction
for
the
stars
will
increase
until
those
coming
from
the
outer
regions
of
its
universe
will
move
at
such
terrific
speed
in
their
spiral
orbits
that
before
coming
in
contact
they
will
be
almost
invisible
having
already
absorbed
all
solid
matter
revolving
about
themselves
these
accessions
of
moving
matter
continually
received
at
and
near
its
equator
will
cause
cosmos
to
spread
out
like
saturn
rings
till
it
becomes
flat
though
the
balance
of
forces
will
be
so
perfect
that
it
is
doubtful
whether
an
animal
or
a
man
placed
there
would
feel
much
change
but
these
universes
or
more
accurately
divisions
of
the
universe
already
planes
though
the
vast
surfaces
are
not
so
flat
as
to
preclude
beautiful
and
gently
rolling
slopes
are
and
will
be
inhabited
only
by
spirits
then
there
are
great
phosphorescent
areas
and
the
colour
of
the
surface
changes
with
every
hour
of
the
day
from
the
most
brilliant
crimson
to
the
softest
shade
of
blue
radiant
with
many
colours
that
your
eyes
can
not
now
see
there
are
also
myriads
of
scented
streams
consisting
of
hundreds
of
different
and
liquids
each
with
a
perfume
sweeter
than
the
most
delicate
flower
and
pouring
forth
the
most
heavenly
music
as
they
go
on
their
way
but
be
not
surprised
at
the
magnitude
of
the
change
for
is
it
not
written
in
revelation
saw
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
for
the
first
heaven
and
the
first
earth
were
passed
away
nor
can
we
be
surprised
at
vastness
sublimity
and
beauty
such
as
never
was
conceived
of
for
do
we
not
find
this
in
his
word
hath
not
seen
nor
ear
heard
neither
have
entered
into
the
heart
of
man
the
things
which
god
hath
prepared
for
them
that
love
him
in
this
blissful
state
those
that
feared
god
and
obeyed
their
consciences
will
live
on
forever
but
their
rest
can
never
become
stagnation
for
evolution
is
one
of
the
most
constant
laws
and
never
ceases
and
they
must
always
go
onward
and
upward
unspeakably
blessed
by
the
consciences
they
made
their
rule
in
life
till
in
purity
and
power
they
shall
equal
or
exceed
the
angels
of
their
lord
in
heaven
but
you
men
of
finite
understanding
will
ask
as
i
myself
should
have
asked
how
by
the
law
of
hydrostatics
can
liquids
flow
on
a
plane
remember
that
though
these
divisions
are
astronomical
or
geometrical
planes
their
surfaces
undulate
but
the
moving
cause
is
this
at
the
centre
of
these
planes
is
a
pole
the
analogue
we
will
say
of
the
magnetic
pole
on
earth
that
has
a
more
effective
attraction
for
a
gas
than
for
a
liquid
when
liquids
approach
the
periphery
of
the
circle
the
rapid
rotation
and
decreased
pressure
cause
them
to
break
up
whereupon
the
elementary
gases
return
to
the
centre
in
the
atmosphere
if
near
the
surface
forming
a
gentle
breeze
on
nearing
the
centre
the
cause
of
the
separation
being
removed
the
gases
reunite
to
form
a
liquid
and
the
centrifugal
force
again
sends
this
on
its
journey
is
there
no
way
asked
bearwarden
by
which
a
man
may
retrieve
himself
if
he
has
lost
or
misused
his
opportunities
on
earth
the
way
a
man
lays
up
treasures
in
heaven
when
on
earth
replied
the
spirit
is
by
gladly
doing
something
for
some
one
else
usually
in
some
form
sacrificing
self
in
hell
no
one
can
do
anything
for
any
one
else
because
every
one
can
have
the
semblance
of
anything
he
wishes
by
merely
concentrating
his
mind
upon
it
though
when
he
has
it
it
is
but
a
shadow
and
gives
him
no
pleasure
thus
no
one
can
give
any
one
else
anything
he
can
not
obtain
himself
and
if
he
could
since
it
would
be
no
sacrifice
on
his
part
he
would
derive
no
great
moral
comfort
from
it
neither
can
any
one
comfort
any
one
else
by
putting
his
acts
or
offences
in
a
new
light
for
every
one
knows
the
whole
truth
about
himself
and
everybody
else
so
that
nothing
can
be
made
to
appear
favourably
or
unfavourably
all
this
however
is
supposing
there
is
the
desire
to
be
kind
but
how
can
spirits
that
were
selfish
and
on
earth
where
there
are
so
many
softening
influences
have
good
inclinations
in
hell
where
they
loathe
one
another
with
constantly
increasing
strength
inasmuch
as
both
the
good
and
the
bad
continue
on
the
lines
on
which
they
started
when
on
earth
we
are
continually
drawing
nearer
to
god
while
they
are
departing
the
gulf
may
be
only
one
of
feeling
but
that
is
enough
it
follows
then
that
with
god
as
our
limit
which
we
of
course
can
never
reach
their
limit
in
the
geometrical
sense
must
be
total
separation
from
him
though
all
spirits
we
are
told
live
forever
it
occurs
to
me
that
in
god
mercy
there
may
be
a
gradual
end
for
though
to
the
happy
souls
in
heaven
a
thousand
years
may
seem
as
nothing
existence
in
hell
must
drag
along
with
leaden
limbs
and
a
single
hour
seem
like
a
lifetime
of
regret
since
it
is
dreadful
to
think
that
such
unsoothed
anguish
should
continue
forever
i
have
often
pondered
whether
it
might
not
be
that
by
a
form
of
involution
and
reversal
of
the
past
law
the
spirit
that
came
to
life
evolved
from
the
mineral
plant
and
animal
worlds
may
mercifully
retrace
its
steps
one
by
one
till
finally
the
soul
shall
penetrate
the
solid
rock
and
hide
itself
by
becoming
part
of
the
planet
many
people
in
my
day
believed
that
after
death
their
souls
would
enter
stately
trees
and
spread
abroad
great
branches
dropping
dead
leaves
over
the
places
on
which
they
had
stood
while
on
earth
this
might
be
the
last
step
in
the
awful
tragedy
of
the
fall
and
involution
of
a
human
soul
in
this
way
those
who
had
wasted
the
priceless
opportunities
given
them
by
god
might
be
mercifully
obliterated
for
it
seems
as
if
they
would
not
be
needed
in
the
economy
of
the
universe
the
bible
however
mentions
no
such
end
and
says
unmistakably
that
hell
will
last
forever
so
that
in
this
supposition
as
in
many
others
the
wish
is
probably
father
of
the
thought
but
persisted
bearwarden
how
about
repentances
those
replied
the
spirit
are
few
and
far
between
the
pains
of
death
at
the
last
hour
leave
but
little
room
for
aught
but
vain
regret
a
man
dies
suddenly
or
may
be
unconscious
some
time
before
the
end
but
they
do
occur
the
question
is
how
much
credit
is
it
to
be
good
when
you
can
do
no
more
harm
the
time
to
resist
evil
and
do
that
which
is
right
is
while
the
temptation
is
on
and
in
its
strength
while
life
lasts
there
is
hope
but
the
books
are
sealed
by
death
the
tree
must
fall
to
one
side
or
the
other
there
is
no
middle
ground
and
as
the
tree
falleth
so
it
lieth
this
however
is
a
gloomy
subject
and
one
that
in
your
heart
of
hearts
you
understand
i
would
rather
tell
you
more
of
the
beauties
and
splendours
of
space
of
the
orange
red
and
blue
stars
and
of
the
tremendous
cyclonic
movements
going
on
within
them
which
are
even
more
violent
than
the
storms
that
rage
in
the
sun
the
clouds
as
the
spectroscope
has
already
shown
consist
of
iron
gold
and
platinum
in
the
form
of
vapour
while
the
openings
revealed
by
or
rather
are
so
tremendous
that
a
comparatively
small
one
would
contain
many
dozen
such
globes
as
the
earth
i
could
tell
you
also
of
the
mysteries
of
the
great
dark
companions
of
some
of
the
stars
and
of
the
stars
that
are
themselves
dark
and
cold
with
naught
but
the
faraway
constellations
to
cheer
them
on
which
night
reigns
eternally
and
that
far
outnumber
the
stars
you
can
see
also
of
the
multiplicity
of
sex
and
extraordinary
forms
of
life
that
exist
there
though
on
none
of
them
are
there
mortal
men
like
those
on
the
earth
nature
in
the
process
of
evolution
has
in
all
these
cases
gone
off
on
an
entirely
different
course
the
most
intelligent
and
highly
developed
species
being
in
the
form
of
marvellously
complex
reptiles
winged
serpents
that
sing
most
beautifully
but
whose
blood
is
cold
being
prevented
from
freezing
in
the
upper
regions
of
the
atmosphere
by
the
presence
of
salt
and
chemicals
and
which
are
so
intelligent
that
they
have
practically
subdued
many
of
these
dark
stars
to
themselves
on
others
the
most
highly
developed
species
have
hollow
tentacles
into
which
they
inject
two
or
more
opposing
gases
from
opposite
sides
of
their
bodies
which
in
combination
produce
a
strong
explosion
this
provides
them
with
an
easy
and
rapid
locomotion
since
the
explosions
find
a
sufficient
resistance
in
the
surrounding
air
to
propel
the
monsters
much
faster
than
birds
these
can
at
pleasure
make
their
breath
so
poisonous
that
the
lungs
of
any
creatures
except
themselves
inhaling
it
are
at
once
turned
to
parchment
others
can
give
their
enemies
or
their
prey
an
electric
shock
sending
a
bolt
through
the
heart
or
can
paralyze
the
mind
physically
by
an
effort
of
their
wills
causing
the
brain
to
decompose
while
the
victim
is
still
alive
others
have
the
same
power
that
snakes
have
though
vastly
intensified
mesmerizing
their
victims
from
afar
still
others
have
such
delicate
senses
that
in
a
way
they
commune
with
spirits
though
they
have
no
souls
themselves
for
in
no
part
or
corner
of
the
universe
except
on
earth
are
there
animals
that
have
souls
yet
they
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
and
often
bewail
their
hard
lot
in
that
no
part
of
them
can
live
when
the
heart
has
ceased
to
beat
ah
my
friends
if
we
had
no
souls
if
like
the
aesthetic
reptilia
we
knew
that
when
our
dust
dissolved
our
existence
would
be
over
we
should
realize
the
preciousness
of
what
we
hold
so
lightly
now
man
and
the
spirits
and
angels
are
the
only
beings
with
souls
and
in
no
place
except
on
earth
are
new
souls
being
created
this
gives
you
the
greatest
and
grandest
idea
of
the
dignity
of
life
and
its
inestimable
value
but
it
is
as
difficult
to
describe
the
higher
wonders
of
the
stellar
worlds
to
you
as
to
picture
the
glories
of
sunset
to
a
blind
man
for
you
have
experienced
nothing
with
which
to
compare
them
instead
of
seeing
all
that
really
is
you
see
but
a
small
part
chapter
ix
doctor
cortlandt
sees
his
grave
is
it
not
distasteful
to
you
cortlandt
asked
to
live
so
near
these
loathsome
dragons
not
in
the
least
replied
the
spirit
they
affect
us
no
more
than
the
smallest
for
we
see
both
with
equal
clearness
since
we
are
not
obliged
to
breathe
they
can
not
injure
us
and
besides
they
serve
to
illustrate
the
working
of
god
laws
and
there
is
beauty
in
everything
for
those
that
have
the
senses
required
for
perceiving
it
a
feature
of
the
spiritual
world
is
that
it
does
not
interfere
with
the
natural
and
the
natural
except
through
faith
is
not
aware
of
its
presence
then
why
asked
cortlandt
was
it
necessary
for
the
almighty
to
bring
your
souls
to
saturn
since
there
would
have
been
no
overcrowding
if
you
had
remained
on
the
earth
that
replied
the
spirit
was
part
of
his
wisdom
for
the
spirit
being
able
at
once
to
look
back
into
the
natural
world
if
in
it
would
be
troubled
at
the
mistakes
and
tribulations
of
his
friends
now
as
a
rule
before
a
spirit
can
return
to
earth
his
or
her
relatives
and
friends
have
also
died
or
if
he
can
return
before
that
happens
he
is
so
advanced
that
he
sees
the
ulterior
purpose
and
therefore
the
wisdom
of
god
ways
and
is
not
distressed
thereby
lastly
as
their
expanding
senses
grew
it
would
be
painful
for
the
blessed
and
condemned
spirits
to
be
together
therefore
we
are
brought
here
where
god
reveals
himself
to
us
more
and
more
and
the
flight
of
the
other
souls
those
unhappy
ones
does
not
cease
till
they
reach
cassandra
can
the
souls
on
cassandra
also
leave
it
in
time
and
roam
at
will
asked
cortlandt
i
have
seen
none
of
them
myself
in
my
journeys
to
other
planets
but
as
the
sun
shines
upon
the
just
and
the
unjust
and
there
is
no
exception
to
nature
laws
i
can
reply
that
in
time
they
do
and
with
equal
powers
their
incentive
to
roam
would
be
greater
for
we
are
drawn
together
by
common
sympathy
and
pure
requited
love
while
they
are
mutually
repelled
of
course
some
obtain
a
measure
of
freedom
before
the
rest
and
these
naturally
roam
the
farthest
and
the
more
they
see
and
the
farther
they
go
the
stronger
becomes
their
abhorrence
for
everything
they
meet
can
not
you
spirits
help
us
and
the
mortals
now
on
earth
to
escape
this
fate
the
greatest
hope
for
your
bodies
and
souls
lies
in
the
communion
with
those
that
have
passed
through
death
for
the
least
of
them
can
tell
you
more
than
the
wisest
man
on
earth
and
could
you
all
come
or
send
representatives
to
the
multitudes
here
who
can
not
as
yet
return
to
you
but
few
on
earth
would
be
so
quixotically
sinful
as
to
refuse
our
advice
since
however
the
greatest
good
comes
to
men
from
the
learning
that
they
make
an
effort
to
secure
it
is
for
you
to
strive
to
reach
us
who
can
act
as
from
god
to
you
it
seems
to
me
said
bearwarden
that
people
are
better
now
than
formerly
the
sin
of
idolatry
for
instance
has
disappeared
has
it
not
men
still
set
up
idols
of
wealth
passion
or
ambition
in
their
hearts
these
they
worship
as
in
days
gone
by
only
the
form
has
changed
could
the
souls
on
cassandra
do
us
bodily
or
mental
injury
if
we
could
ever
reach
their
planet
asked
bearwarden
they
might
oppress
and
distress
you
but
your
faith
would
protect
you
wherever
you
might
go
can
you
give
us
a
taste
of
your
sense
of
prescience
asked
bearwarden
again
for
since
it
is
not
clear
in
what
degree
the
condemned
receive
this
and
neither
is
it
by
any
means
sure
that
i
shall
be
saved
i
should
like
for
once
in
my
history
to
experience
this
sense
of
divinity
before
my
entity
ends
in
stone
i
will
transfer
to
you
my
sense
of
prescience
replied
the
spirit
that
you
may
foresee
as
prophets
have
in
so
doing
i
shall
but
anticipate
since
you
will
yourselves
in
time
obtain
this
sense
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
is
there
any
event
in
the
future
you
would
like
to
see
in
order
that
when
the
vision
is
fulfilled
it
may
tend
to
stablish
your
faith
since
i
am
the
oldest
replied
the
doctor
and
shall
probably
die
before
my
friends
reveal
to
us
i
pray
you
the
manner
of
my
death
and
the
events
immediately
following
this
may
prove
an
to
them
and
will
greatly
interest
me
your
death
will
be
caused
by
brought
on
by
an
accident
began
the
spirit
some
daybreak
will
find
you
weak
after
a
troubled
night
with
your
bodily
resources
at
a
low
ebb
sunset
will
see
you
weaker
with
your
power
of
resistance
almost
gone
midnight
will
find
you
weaker
still
and
but
little
removed
from
the
point
of
death
a
few
hours
later
a
kind
hand
will
close
the
lids
of
your
eyes
which
never
again
will
behold
the
light
the
coffin
will
inclose
your
body
and
the
last
earthly
journey
begin
now
the
spirit
continued
you
shall
all
use
my
sight
instead
of
your
own
the
walls
of
the
cave
seemed
to
expand
till
they
resembled
those
of
a
great
cathedral
while
the
stalactites
appeared
to
be
metamorphosed
into
gothic
columns
they
found
themselves
among
a
large
congregation
that
had
come
to
attend
the
last
sad
rites
while
the
great
organ
played
chopin
funeral
march
the
high
vault
and
arches
received
the
organ
tone
and
a
sombre
light
pervaded
the
interior
there
was
a
slight
flutter
and
a
craning
of
necks
among
those
in
the
pews
as
the
procession
began
to
ascend
the
aisle
while
the
slow
step
of
the
pallbearers
and
those
carrying
the
coffin
sounded
on
the
stone
floor
the
clear
voice
of
the
clergyman
that
headed
the
procession
sounded
these
words
through
the
cathedral
i
know
that
my
redeemer
liveth
and
that
he
shall
stand
at
the
latter
day
upon
the
earth
as
the
bier
advanced
bearwarden
and
ayrault
recognized
themselves
among
the
pallbearers
the
former
with
grey
mustache
and
hair
the
latter
considerably
aged
the
hermetically
sealed
lead
coffin
was
inclosed
in
a
wooden
case
and
the
whole
was
draped
and
covered
with
flowers
oh
my
faith
cried
cortlandt
i
see
my
face
within
yet
it
is
but
a
decomposing
mass
that
i
once
described
as
i
then
again
did
the
minister
voice
proclaim
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
saith
the
lord
he
that
believeth
in
me
though
he
were
dead
yet
shall
he
live
and
whosoever
liveth
and
believeth
in
me
shall
never
die
the
bearers
gently
set
down
their
burden
the
minister
read
the
chapter
of
paul
to
the
corinthians
a
bishop
solemnly
and
silently
sprinkled
earth
on
the
coffin
and
the
choir
sang
the
hymn
beginning
with
the
words
hark
hark
my
soul
angelic
songs
are
swelling
which
had
always
been
cortlandt
favourite
and
the
service
was
at
an
end
the
bearers
again
shouldered
all
that
was
left
of
henry
cortlandt
and
his
relatives
accompanied
this
to
the
cemetery
then
came
a
sweeping
change
of
scene
a
host
of
monuments
and
gravestones
reflected
the
sunlight
while
a
broad
river
ebbed
and
flowed
between
high
banks
a
sexton
and
a
watchman
stood
by
a
granite
vault
the
heavy
door
of
which
they
had
opened
with
a
large
key
hard
by
were
some
gardeners
and
labourers
and
also
a
crowd
of
who
had
come
to
witness
the
last
sad
rites
presently
a
funeral
procession
appeared
the
hearse
stopped
near
the
open
vault
over
the
door
of
which
stood
out
the
name
of
cortlandt
and
the
accompanying
minister
said
a
short
prayer
while
all
present
uncovered
their
heads
after
this
the
coffin
was
borne
within
and
set
at
rest
upon
a
slab
among
many
generations
of
cortlandts
in
the
hearts
of
the
relatives
and
friends
was
genuine
sorrow
but
the
went
their
way
and
gave
little
thought
will
be
like
they
said
and
more
great
men
will
die
then
came
another
change
of
scene
though
it
was
comparatively
slight
the
sun
slowly
sank
beyond
the
farther
bank
of
the
broad
river
and
the
moon
and
stars
shone
softly
on
the
gravestones
and
crosses
two
gardeners
smoked
their
short
clay
pipes
on
a
bench
before
the
cortlandt
vault
and
talked
in
a
slow
manner
he
was
a
great
man
said
one
and
if
his
soul
blooms
like
the
flowers
on
his
grave
he
must
be
in
paradise
which
we
know
is
a
finer
park
than
this
he
was
expert
for
the
government
when
the
earth
axis
was
set
right
said
the
second
gardener
and
he
must
have
been
a
scholar
for
his
calculations
have
all
come
true
he
was
one
of
the
first
three
men
to
visit
the
other
planets
while
the
obituaries
in
the
papers
say
his
history
will
be
read
hereafter
like
the
books
of
caesar
after
burying
all
these
great
people
i
sometimes
wish
i
could
do
the
same
for
myself
for
the
people
i
bury
seem
to
be
remembered
after
this
they
relapsed
into
their
meditations
the
silence
being
broken
only
by
an
occasional
murmur
from
the
river
steady
flow
hereupon
the
voyagers
found
they
were
once
more
in
the
cave
the
fire
had
burned
low
and
the
dawn
was
already
in
the
east
cortlandt
wiped
his
forehead
shivered
and
looked
extremely
pale
thank
heaven
he
cried
we
can
not
ordinarily
foresee
our
end
for
but
few
would
attain
their
predestined
ending
could
they
see
it
in
advance
may
the
veil
not
again
be
raised
lest
i
faint
before
it
i
looked
in
vain
for
my
soul
he
continued
but
could
see
it
nowhere
the
souls
of
those
dying
young
replied
the
spirit
sometimes
wish
to
hover
near
their
ashes
as
if
regretting
an
unfinished
life
or
the
opportunities
that
have
departed
but
those
dying
after
middle
age
are
usually
glad
to
be
free
from
their
bodies
and
seldom
think
of
them
again
i
shall
append
the
lines
now
in
my
head
to
my
history
said
cortlandt
that
where
it
goes
they
may
go
also
they
can
scarcely
fail
to
be
instructive
as
the
conclusions
of
a
man
who
has
seen
beyond
his
grave
whereupon
be
wrote
a
stanza
in
his
and
closed
it
without
showing
his
companions
what
he
had
written
may
they
do
all
the
good
you
hope
and
much
more
replied
the
spirit
for
the
reward
in
the
resurrection
morning
will
vastly
exceed
all
your
labours
now
o
my
friends
the
spirit
continued
most
earnestly
addressing
the
three
are
you
prepared
for
your
when
your
eyes
glaze
in
their
last
sleep
and
you
lose
that
temporal
world
and
what
you
perhaps
considered
all
as
in
a
haze
your
dim
vision
will
then
be
displaced
by
the
true
creation
that
will
be
eternal
your
unattained
ambitions
your
hopes
and
your
ideals
will
be
swallowed
in
the
grave
your
works
will
secure
you
a
place
in
history
and
many
will
remember
your
names
until
in
time
oblivion
covers
your
memory
as
the
grass
conceals
your
tombs
are
you
prepared
for
the
time
when
your
eyes
become
blind
and
your
trusted
senses
fail
your
sorrowing
friends
will
mourn
and
the
flags
of
your
clubs
will
fly
at
but
no
earthly
thing
can
help
you
then
in
what
condition
will
the
resurrection
morning
find
you
when
your
sins
of
neglect
and
commission
plead
for
vengeance
as
abel
blood
from
the
ground
after
that
there
can
be
no
change
the
classification
as
i
have
already
told
you
is
now
going
on
it
will
then
be
finished
we
are
the
most
utterly
wretched
sinners
cried
ayrault
show
us
how
we
can
be
saved
as
an
inhabitant
of
i
will
give
you
worldly
counsel
replied
the
bishop
during
my
earthly
administration
as
i
told
you
people
came
from
far
to
hear
me
preach
this
was
because
i
had
eloquence
and
earnestness
both
gifts
of
god
but
i
was
a
miserably
weak
sinner
myself
that
which
i
would
i
did
not
and
that
which
i
would
not
that
i
did
and
i
often
prayed
my
congregation
to
follow
my
sermons
rather
than
my
ways
i
seemed
to
do
my
followers
good
and
daniel
thus
commends
my
way
in
his
last
chapter
that
turn
many
to
righteousness
shall
shine
as
the
stars
forever
and
ever
and
the
explanation
is
clear
there
is
no
surer
way
of
learning
than
trying
to
teach
in
teaching
my
several
flocks
i
was
also
improved
myself
i
was
sown
in
weakness
but
was
raised
in
power
strength
being
made
perfect
in
weakness
therefore
improve
your
fellows
though
yourself
you
can
not
raise
the
knowledge
that
you
have
sent
many
souls
to
heaven
though
you
are
yourself
a
castaway
will
give
you
unspeakable
joy
and
place
you
in
heaven
wherever
you
may
be
yet
remember
this
none
of
us
can
win
heaven
salvation
is
the
gift
of
god
i
have
said
as
much
now
as
you
can
remember
farewell
improve
time
while
you
can
fear
god
and
keep
his
commandments
this
is
the
whole
duty
of
man
so
saying
the
spirit
vanished
in
a
cloud
that
for
a
time
emitted
light
i
am
not
surprised
said
bearwarden
that
people
took
long
journeys
to
hear
him
i
would
do
so
myself
i
have
never
had
much
fear
of
death
said
cortlandt
but
the
mere
thought
of
it
now
makes
my
knees
shake
and
fills
my
heart
with
dread
i
thought
i
saw
the
most
hateful
forms
about
my
coffin
and
imagined
that
they
might
be
the
personification
of
doubt
coldness
and
my
other
shortcomings
which
had
come
perhaps
from
sympathy
in
invisible
form
i
was
almost
afraid
to
ask
the
spirit
for
the
explanation
i
saw
them
also
replied
bearwarden
but
took
them
to
be
swarms
of
microbes
waiting
to
destroy
your
body
or
perhaps
trying
in
vain
to
penetrate
your
hermetically
sealed
coffin
cortlandt
seemed
much
upset
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
writing
out
the
facts
and
trying
to
assign
a
cause
towards
evening
bearwarden
who
had
recovered
his
spirits
prepared
supper
after
which
they
sat
in
the
entrance
to
the
cave
chapter
ayrault
as
the
night
became
darker
they
caught
sight
of
the
earth
again
shining
very
faintly
and
in
his
mind
eye
ayrault
saw
his
sweetheart
and
the
old
old
repining
that
since
reason
and
love
began
has
been
in
men
minds
came
upon
him
and
almost
crushed
him
without
saying
anything
to
his
companions
ayrault
left
the
cave
and
passing
through
the
grove
in
which
the
spirit
had
paid
them
his
second
visit
went
slowly
to
the
top
of
the
hill
about
half
a
mile
off
that
he
might
the
more
easily
gaze
at
the
faint
star
on
which
he
could
picture
sylvia
ah
he
said
to
himself
on
reaching
the
summit
i
will
stay
here
till
the
earth
rises
higher
and
when
it
is
far
above
me
i
will
gaze
at
it
as
at
heaven
accordingly
he
lay
down
with
his
head
on
a
mound
of
sod
and
watched
the
familiar
planet
we
were
born
too
soon
he
soliloquized
for
had
sylvia
and
i
but
lived
in
the
spiritual
age
foretold
by
the
bishop
we
might
have
held
communion
while
now
our
spirits
no
matter
how
much
in
love
are
separated
absolutely
by
a
mere
matter
of
distance
it
is
a
mockery
to
see
sylvia
and
feel
that
she
is
beyond
my
vision
o
that
in
the
absence
of
something
better
my
poor
imperfect
eyes
could
be
transformed
into
those
of
an
eagle
but
with
a
million
times
the
power
for
though
i
know
that
with
these
senses
i
shall
see
the
resurrection
and
hear
the
last
trump
that
is
but
prospective
while
now
is
the
time
i
long
for
sight
on
the
plain
he
had
left
he
saw
his
friends
while
on
the
other
side
of
his
elevation
was
a
valley
in
which
the
insects
chirped
sharply
and
through
which
ran
a
stream
feeling
a
desire
for
solitude
and
to
be
as
far
removed
as
possible
he
arose
and
descended
towards
the
water
though
the
autumn
where
they
found
themselves
was
well
advanced
this
night
was
warm
and
the
rings
formed
a
great
arch
above
his
head
near
the
stream
the
frogs
croaked
happily
as
if
unmindful
of
the
long
very
long
saturnian
winter
for
though
they
were
removed
but
about
ten
degrees
from
the
equator
the
sun
was
so
remote
and
the
axis
of
the
planet
so
inclined
that
it
was
unlikely
these
individual
frogs
would
see
another
summer
though
they
might
live
again
in
a
sense
in
their
descendants
the
insects
also
would
soon
be
frozen
and
stiff
and
the
tall
graceful
lilies
that
still
clung
to
life
would
be
withered
and
dead
the
trees
as
if
weeping
at
the
evanescence
of
the
life
around
them
shed
their
leaves
at
the
faintest
breeze
these
fluttered
to
the
ground
or
falling
into
the
tranquil
stream
were
carried
away
by
it
and
passed
from
sight
ayrault
stood
musing
and
regretting
the
necessity
of
such
general
death
but
he
thought
i
would
rather
die
than
lose
my
love
for
then
i
should
have
had
the
taste
of
bliss
without
its
fulfilment
and
should
be
worse
off
than
dead
love
gilds
the
commonplace
and
deifies
all
it
touches
love
survives
the
winter
and
in
my
present
frame
of
mind
i
should
prefer
earth
and
cold
with
it
to
heaven
and
spring
oh
why
is
my
soul
so
clogged
by
my
body
a
pillar
of
stone
standing
near
him
was
suddenly
shattered
and
the
bishop
stood
where
it
had
been
because
said
the
spirit
answering
his
thought
it
has
not
yet
power
to
be
free
can
a
man
soul
not
rise
till
his
body
is
dead
asked
ayrault
the
spirit
hesitated
oh
tell
me
pleaded
ayrault
if
i
could
see
the
girl
to
whom
i
am
engaged
for
but
a
moment
could
be
convinced
that
she
loves
me
still
my
mind
would
be
at
rest
free
my
soul
or
spirit
or
whatever
it
is
from
this
body
that
i
may
traverse
intervening
space
and
be
with
her
you
will
discover
the
way
for
yourself
in
time
said
the
spirit
i
know
i
shall
at
the
last
day
in
the
resurrection
when
i
am
no
longer
in
the
flesh
then
i
shall
have
no
need
of
your
aid
for
we
know
that
in
the
resurrection
they
neither
marry
nor
are
given
in
marriage
but
are
like
the
angels
of
god
in
heaven
it
is
while
i
am
mortal
and
love
as
mortals
do
that
i
wish
to
see
my
promised
bride
a
spirit
may
have
other
joys
and
perhaps
higher
but
you
who
have
lived
in
the
world
and
loved
show
me
that
which
is
now
my
heart
desire
you
have
shown
us
the
tomb
in
which
cortlandt
will
lie
buried
now
help
me
to
go
to
one
who
is
still
alive
i
pray
that
god
will
grant
you
this
said
the
spirit
and
make
me
his
instrument
for
i
see
the
depth
of
your
distress
saying
which
he
vanished
leaving
no
trace
in
his
departure
except
that
the
pillar
of
stone
returned
to
its
place
with
this
rather
vague
hope
ayrault
set
off
to
rejoin
his
companions
for
he
felt
the
need
of
human
sympathy
rapid
rotation
had
brought
the
earth
almost
to
the
zenith
the
little
point
shining
with
the
unmistakably
steady
ray
of
a
planet
huge
bats
fluttered
about
him
and
the
great
swept
across
the
sky
being
part
of
ceaseless
whirl
he
found
he
was
in
a
hypnotic
or
spiritualistic
state
for
it
was
not
necessary
for
him
to
have
his
eyes
open
to
know
where
he
was
in
passing
one
of
the
pools
they
had
noticed
he
observed
that
the
upper
and
previously
invisible
liquid
had
the
bright
colour
of
gold
and
about
it
rested
a
group
of
figures
enveloped
in
light
why
do
you
look
so
sad
they
asked
you
are
in
that
abode
of
departed
spirits
known
as
paradise
and
should
be
happy
i
suppose
i
should
be
happy
were
i
here
as
you
are
as
the
reward
of
merit
he
replied
but
i
am
still
in
the
flesh
and
as
such
am
subject
to
its
cares
you
are
about
to
have
an
experience
said
another
speaker
this
day
your
doubts
will
be
at
rest
for
before
another
sunset
you
will
know
more
of
the
woman
you
love
the
intensity
of
the
spiritualistic
influence
here
somewhat
weakened
for
he
partially
lost
sight
of
the
luminous
figures
and
could
no
longer
hear
what
they
said
his
heart
was
in
his
mouth
as
he
walked
and
he
felt
like
a
man
about
to
set
out
on
his
honeymoon
or
like
a
bride
who
knows
not
whether
to
laugh
or
to
cry
an
indescribable
exhilaration
was
constantly
present
i
wonder
thought
he
if
a
caterpillar
has
these
sensations
before
becoming
a
butterfly
though
i
return
to
the
rock
from
which
i
sprang
i
believe
i
shall
be
with
sylvia
footprints
formed
in
the
soft
ground
all
around
him
and
the
air
was
filled
with
spots
of
phosphorescent
light
that
coincided
with
the
relative
positions
of
the
brains
hearts
and
eyes
of
human
beings
these
surrounded
and
often
preceded
him
as
though
leading
him
on
while
the
most
heavenly
anthems
filled
the
air
and
the
vault
of
the
sky
i
believe
he
thought
with
bounding
heart
that
i
shall
be
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
space
this
night
at
times
he
could
hear
even
the
words
of
the
choruses
ringing
in
his
ears
though
at
others
he
thought
the
effect
was
altogether
in
his
mind
oh
for
a
proof
he
prayed
that
no
sane
man
can
doubt
my
faith
is
implicit
in
the
bishop
and
the
vision
and
i
feel
that
in
some
way
i
shall
return
to
earth
ere
the
close
of
another
day
for
i
know
i
am
awake
and
that
this
is
no
dream
a
fire
burned
in
the
mouth
of
the
cave
within
which
bearwarden
and
cortlandt
lay
sleeping
the
specks
of
mica
in
the
rocks
reflected
its
light
but
in
addition
to
this
a
diffused
phosphorescence
filled
the
place
and
the
large
stones
they
used
for
pillows
emitted
purple
and
dark
red
flames
is
that
you
dick
asked
bearwarden
awaking
and
groping
about
we
built
up
the
fire
so
that
you
should
find
the
camp
but
it
seems
to
have
gone
down
saying
which
he
struck
a
match
whereupon
ayrault
ceased
to
see
the
phosphorescence
or
bluish
light
at
that
moment
a
peal
of
thunder
awakened
cortlandt
who
sat
up
and
rubbed
his
eyes
i
think
said
ayrault
i
will
go
to
the
callisto
and
get
our
mackintoshes
before
the
rain
sets
in
whereupon
he
left
his
companions
who
were
soon
again
fast
asleep
the
sky
had
suddenly
become
filled
with
clouds
and
ayrault
hastened
towards
the
callisto
intending
to
remain
there
if
necessary
until
the
storm
was
over
for
about
twenty
minutes
he
hurried
on
through
the
growing
darkness
stopping
once
on
high
ground
to
make
sure
of
his
bearings
and
he
had
covered
more
than
half
the
distance
when
the
rain
came
on
in
a
flood
accompanied
by
brilliant
lightning
seeing
the
huge
hollow
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
near
and
not
wishing
to
be
wet
through
ayrault
fired
several
solid
shots
from
his
revolver
into
the
cavity
to
drive
out
any
wild
animals
there
might
be
inside
and
then
hurriedly
crawled
in
feet
first
he
next
drew
in
his
head
and
was
congratulating
himself
on
his
snug
retreat
when
the
sky
became
lurid
with
a
flash
of
lightning
then
his
head
dropped
forward
and
he
was
unconscious
chapter
xi
dreamland
to
shadowland
as
ayrault
consciousness
returned
he
fancied
he
heard
music
though
distant
it
was
distinct
and
seemed
to
ring
from
the
ether
of
space
occasionally
it
sounded
even
more
remote
but
it
was
rhythmical
and
continuous
inspiring
and
stirring
him
as
nothing
that
he
had
ever
heard
before
finally
it
was
overcome
by
the
more
vivid
impressions
upon
his
other
senses
and
he
found
himself
walking
in
the
streets
of
his
native
city
it
was
spring
and
the
trees
were
white
with
buds
the
long
shadows
of
the
late
afternoon
stretched
across
the
way
but
the
clear
sky
gave
indication
of
prolonged
twilight
and
the
air
was
warm
and
balmy
nature
was
filled
with
life
and
seemed
to
be
proclaiming
that
the
cold
was
past
as
he
moved
along
the
street
he
met
a
funeral
procession
what
a
pity
he
thought
a
man
should
die
with
summer
so
near
at
hand
he
was
also
surprised
at
the
keenness
of
his
sight
for
inclosed
in
each
man
body
he
saw
the
outline
of
his
soul
but
the
dead
man
body
was
empty
like
a
cage
without
a
bird
he
also
read
the
thoughts
in
their
minds
now
said
a
large
man
in
the
carriage
next
the
hearse
i
may
win
her
since
she
is
a
widow
the
widow
herself
kept
thinking
would
it
had
been
i
his
life
was
essential
to
the
children
while
i
should
scarcely
have
been
missed
i
wish
i
had
no
duties
here
and
might
follow
him
now
while
pondering
on
these
things
he
reached
sylvia
house
and
went
into
the
little
room
in
which
he
had
so
often
seen
her
the
warm
southwesterly
breeze
blew
through
the
open
windows
and
far
beyond
central
park
the
approaching
sunset
promised
to
be
beautiful
the
table
was
covered
with
flowers
and
though
he
had
often
seen
that
variety
he
had
never
before
noticed
the
marvellous
combinations
of
colours
while
the
room
was
filled
with
a
thousand
delicious
perfumes
the
thrush
hanging
in
the
window
sang
divinely
and
in
a
silver
frame
he
saw
a
likeness
of
himself
i
have
always
loved
this
room
he
thought
but
it
seems
to
me
now
like
heaven
he
sat
down
in
an
from
force
of
habit
to
await
his
fiancee
oh
for
a
walk
with
sylvia
by
twilight
his
thoughts
ran
on
for
she
need
not
be
at
home
again
till
after
seven
presently
he
heard
the
soft
rustle
of
her
dress
and
rose
to
meet
her
though
she
looked
in
his
direction
she
did
not
seem
to
see
him
and
walked
past
him
to
the
window
she
was
the
picture
of
loveliness
silhouetted
against
the
sky
he
went
towards
her
and
gazed
into
her
eyes
which
had
a
expression
she
turned
went
gracefully
to
the
mantelpiece
and
took
a
photograph
of
herself
from
behind
the
clock
on
its
back
ayrault
had
scrawled
a
boyish
verse
composed
by
himself
which
ran
my
divine
most
ideal
sylvia
o
vision
with
eyes
so
blue
is
in
the
highest
degree
consequential
to
my
existence
in
fact
essential
that
i
should
be
loved
by
you
as
she
read
and
reread
those
lines
with
his
whole
soul
he
yearned
to
have
her
look
at
him
he
watched
the
colour
come
and
go
in
her
clear
bright
complexion
and
was
rejoiced
to
see
in
her
the
personification
of
activity
and
health
beneath
his
own
effusion
on
the
photograph
he
saw
something
written
in
pencil
in
the
hand
he
knew
so
well
did
you
but
know
how
i
love
you
no
more
silly
things
would
you
ask
with
my
whole
heart
and
soul
i
adore
you
idiot
goose
bombast
and
as
she
glanced
at
it
these
thoughts
crossed
her
mind
i
shall
never
call
you
such
names
again
how
much
i
shall
have
to
tell
you
it
is
provoking
that
you
stay
away
so
long
he
came
still
nearer
so
near
in
fact
that
he
could
hear
the
beating
of
her
heart
but
she
still
seemed
entirely
unconscious
of
his
presence
losing
his
reserve
and
he
impulsively
grasped
at
her
hands
then
fell
on
his
knees
and
then
dumfounded
struggled
to
his
feet
her
hands
seemed
to
slip
through
his
he
was
not
able
to
touch
her
and
she
was
still
unaware
of
his
presence
suddenly
a
whole
flood
of
light
and
the
truth
burst
upon
him
he
had
passed
painlessly
and
unconsciously
from
the
dreamland
of
saturn
to
the
shadowland
of
eternity
the
mystery
was
solved
like
the
dead
bishop
he
had
become
a
free
spirit
his
prayer
was
answered
and
his
body
struck
by
lightning
lay
far
away
on
that
great
ringed
planet
how
he
longed
to
take
in
his
arms
the
girl
who
had
promised
herself
to
him
and
who
he
now
saw
loved
him
with
her
whole
heart
but
he
was
only
an
immaterial
spirit
lighter
even
than
the
ether
of
space
and
the
unchangeable
laws
of
the
universe
seemed
to
him
but
the
irony
of
fate
as
a
spirit
he
was
intangible
and
invisible
to
those
in
the
flesh
and
likewise
they
were
beyond
his
control
the
tragedy
of
life
then
dawned
upon
him
and
the
awful
results
of
death
made
themselves
felt
he
glanced
at
sylvia
on
coming
in
she
had
looked
radiantly
happy
now
she
seemed
depressed
and
even
the
bird
stopped
singing
oh
he
thought
could
i
but
return
to
life
for
one
hour
to
tell
her
how
incessantly
she
has
been
in
my
thoughts
and
how
i
love
her
death
to
the
aged
is
no
loss
in
fact
a
blessing
but
now
and
he
sobbed
mentally
in
the
anguish
of
his
soul
if
he
could
but
communicate
with
her
he
thought
but
he
remembered
what
the
departed
bishop
had
said
that
it
would
take
most
men
centuries
to
do
this
and
that
others
could
never
learn
by
that
time
she
too
would
be
dead
perhaps
having
been
the
wife
of
some
one
else
and
he
felt
a
sense
of
jealousy
even
beyond
the
grave
throwing
himself
upon
a
rug
on
the
floor
in
a
paroxysm
of
distress
he
gazed
at
sylvia
oh
horrible
mockery
he
thought
thinking
of
the
spirit
he
gave
me
worse
than
a
stone
when
i
asked
for
bread
for
in
place
of
freedom
he
sent
me
death
could
i
but
be
alive
again
for
a
few
moments
but
with
a
bitter
smile
he
again
remembered
the
words
of
the
bishop
what
would
a
soul
in
hell
not
give
for
but
one
hour
on
earth
sylvia
had
seated
herself
on
a
small
sofa
on
which
and
next
to
her
he
had
so
often
sat
her
gentle
eyes
had
a
thoughtful
look
while
her
face
was
the
personification
of
intelligence
and
beauty
she
occasionally
glanced
at
his
photograph
which
she
held
in
her
hand
sylvia
sylvia
he
suddenly
cried
rising
to
his
knees
at
her
feet
i
love
i
adore
you
it
was
my
longing
to
be
with
you
that
brought
me
here
i
know
you
can
neither
see
nor
hear
me
but
can
not
your
soul
commune
with
mine
is
dick
here
cried
sylvia
becoming
deadly
pale
and
getting
up
or
am
i
losing
my
reason
seeing
that
she
was
distressed
by
the
power
of
his
mind
ayrault
once
more
sank
to
the
floor
burying
his
face
in
his
hands
unable
to
endure
this
longer
and
feeling
as
if
his
heart
must
break
he
rushed
out
into
the
street
wishing
he
might
soothe
his
anguish
with
a
hypodermic
injection
of
morphine
and
that
he
had
a
body
with
which
to
divert
and
suppress
his
soul
night
had
fallen
and
the
electric
lamps
cast
their
white
rays
on
the
ground
while
the
stars
overhead
shone
in
their
eternal
serenity
and
calm
then
was
it
once
more
brought
home
to
him
that
he
was
a
spirit
for
darkness
and
light
were
alike
and
he
felt
the
beginning
of
that
sense
of
prescience
of
which
the
bishop
had
spoken
passing
through
the
houses
of
some
of
the
clubs
to
which
he
belonged
he
saw
his
name
still
upon
the
list
of
members
and
then
he
went
to
the
places
of
amusement
he
knew
so
well
on
all
sides
were
familiar
faces
but
what
interested
him
most
was
the
great
division
incessantly
going
on
here
were
jolly
people
enjoying
life
and
playing
cards
who
his
foresight
showed
him
would
in
less
than
a
year
be
under
ground
like
mercutio
in
romeo
and
juliet
known
as
merry
fellows
who
would
be
grave
men
while
his
eyes
beheld
the
sun
he
had
imagined
the
air
felt
warm
and
balmy
he
now
saw
that
this
had
been
a
hallucination
for
he
was
chilled
through
and
through
he
also
perceived
that
be
cast
no
shadow
and
that
no
one
observed
his
presence
he
on
the
other
hand
saw
not
only
the
air
as
it
entered
and
left
his
friends
lungs
but
also
the
substance
of
their
brains
and
the
seeds
of
disease
and
death
whose
presence
they
themselves
did
not
even
suspect
and
the
per
cent
of
water
in
their
bodies
making
them
appear
like
sacks
of
liquid
in
some
he
saw
the
germs
of
consumption
in
others
affections
of
the
heart
in
all
he
saw
the
incessant
struggle
between
the
healthy
and
the
malignant
omnipresent
bacilli
that
the
cells
were
trying
to
overcome
many
men
and
women
he
saw
were
in
love
and
he
could
tell
what
all
were
about
to
do
oh
the
secrets
that
were
revealed
while
the
motives
for
acts
were
now
laid
bare
that
till
then
he
had
misunderstood
he
had
often
heard
the
old
saying
that
if
every
person
in
a
could
read
the
thoughts
of
the
rest
the
ball
would
seem
a
travesty
on
enjoyment
rather
than
real
pleasure
and
now
he
perceived
its
force
he
also
noticed
that
many
were
better
than
he
had
supposed
and
were
trying
in
a
blundering
but
persevering
way
to
obey
their
consciences
he
saw
some
unselfish
thoughts
and
acts
many
things
that
he
had
attributed
to
irresolution
or
inconsistency
he
perceived
were
in
reality
sacrifice
he
went
on
in
frantic
disquiet
distance
no
longer
being
of
consequence
and
in
his
roaming
chanced
to
pass
through
the
graveyard
in
which
many
generations
of
his
ancestors
lay
buried
within
the
leaden
coffins
he
saw
the
cold
remains
some
well
preserved
others
but
handfuls
of
dust
tell
me
o
my
progenitors
he
cried
you
whose
blood
till
this
morning
flowed
in
my
veins
is
there
not
some
way
by
which
i
as
a
spirit
can
commune
with
the
material
world
i
have
always
admired
your
judgment
and
wisdom
and
you
have
all
been
in
shadowland
longer
than
i
give
me
i
pray
you
some
ancestral
advice
the
only
sound
in
answer
was
the
hum
of
the
insects
that
filled
the
evening
air
the
moonlight
shone
softly
but
in
a
ghastly
way
on
the
marble
crosses
of
his
vault
and
those
around
and
he
felt
an
unspeakable
sadness
within
this
abode
of
the
dead
how
many
unfinished
lives
he
thought
have
ended
beneath
these
sods
unimproved
talents
here
are
buried
in
the
ground
unattained
ambitions
and
those
who
died
before
their
time
those
who
tried
in
a
way
to
improve
their
opportunities
and
accomplished
something
and
those
who
neglected
them
and
did
still
less
all
are
together
here
the
just
with
the
unjust
though
it
be
for
the
last
time
the
grave
absorbs
their
bodies
and
ends
their
probationary
record
from
which
there
is
no
appeal
near
by
were
some
open
graves
ready
to
receive
their
occupants
while
a
little
farther
on
he
recognized
the
cortlandt
mausoleum
looking
exactly
as
when
shown
him
through
his
second
sight
by
the
spirit
on
the
previous
day
from
the
graves
filled
recently
and
from
many
others
rose
threads
of
coloured
matter
in
the
form
of
gases
the
forerunners
of
miasma
he
now
perceived
shadowy
figures
flitting
about
on
the
ground
and
in
the
air
from
whose
eyes
poured
streams
of
immaterial
tears
their
brains
hearts
and
vertebral
columns
were
the
parts
most
easily
seen
and
they
were
filled
with
an
inextinguishable
anguish
and
sorrow
that
from
its
very
intensity
made
itself
seen
as
a
blue
flame
the
ruffles
and
knickerbockers
in
which
some
of
these
were
attired
evidently
by
the
effects
of
the
thoughts
in
their
minds
doubtless
from
force
of
habit
from
what
they
had
worn
on
earth
while
alive
showed
that
they
had
been
dead
at
least
two
hundred
years
ayrault
also
now
found
himself
in
street
clothes
although
when
in
his
clubs
he
had
worn
a
dress
suit
tell
me
he
said
addressing
them
how
can
i
communicate
with
one
that
is
still
alive
they
looked
at
him
with
moist
eyes
but
answered
not
a
word
i
attributed
the
misery
in
my
heart
thought
ayrault
entirely
to
the
distress
at
losing
sylvia
which
god
knows
is
enough
but
though
i
suspected
it
before
i
now
see
by
my
companions
that
i
am
in
the
depths
of
hell
chapter
xii
sheol
failing
to
find
words
to
convey
his
thoughts
he
threw
himself
into
an
open
grave
praying
that
the
earth
might
hide
his
soul
as
he
had
supposed
it
some
day
would
hide
his
body
but
the
ground
was
like
crystal
and
he
saw
the
white
bones
in
the
graves
all
around
him
unable
to
endure
these
surroundings
longer
he
rushed
back
to
his
old
haunts
where
he
knew
he
should
find
the
friends
of
his
youth
he
did
not
pause
to
go
by
the
usual
way
but
passed
without
stopping
through
walls
and
buildings
soon
he
beheld
the
familiar
scene
and
heard
his
own
name
mentioned
but
there
was
no
comfort
here
and
what
he
had
seen
of
old
was
but
an
incident
to
what
he
gazed
on
now
praying
with
his
whole
heart
that
he
might
make
himself
heard
he
stepped
upon
a
and
cried
your
bodies
are
decaying
before
me
you
are
burying
your
talents
in
the
ground
we
must
all
stand
for
final
sentence
at
the
last
day
mortals
and
spirits
alike
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
a
shade
of
doubt
your
every
thought
will
be
known
and
for
every
evil
deed
and
every
idle
word
god
will
bring
us
into
judgment
the
angel
of
death
is
among
you
and
at
work
in
your
very
midst
are
you
prepared
to
receive
him
he
has
already
killed
my
body
and
now
that
i
can
never
die
i
wish
there
was
a
grave
for
my
soul
i
was
reassured
by
a
vision
that
told
me
i
was
safe
but
either
it
was
a
hallucination
or
i
have
been
betrayed
by
some
spirit
last
night
i
still
lived
and
my
body
obeyed
my
will
since
then
i
have
experienced
death
and
with
the
resulting
increased
knowledge
comes
the
loss
of
all
hope
with
keener
pangs
than
i
supposed
could
exist
oh
that
i
had
now
their
opportunities
that
i
might
write
a
thesis
that
should
live
forever
and
save
millions
of
souls
from
the
anguish
of
mine
inoculate
your
mortal
bodies
with
the
germs
of
faith
and
mutual
love
in
a
stronger
degree
than
they
dwelt
in
me
lest
you
lose
the
life
above
but
no
one
heard
him
and
he
preached
in
vain
he
again
rushed
forth
and
after
a
effort
found
himself
in
the
street
before
his
loved
one
home
scarcely
knowing
why
except
that
it
had
become
nature
to
wish
to
be
near
her
he
stood
for
a
long
time
opposite
her
dwelling
o
house
he
cried
inanimate
object
that
can
yet
enthral
me
so
i
stand
before
your
cold
front
as
a
suppliant
from
a
very
distant
realm
yet
in
my
sadness
i
am
colder
than
your
stones
more
alone
than
in
a
desolate
place
she
that
dwells
within
you
holds
my
love
i
long
for
her
shadow
or
the
sound
of
her
step
i
am
more
wretchedly
in
love
than
ever
i
an
impotent
invisible
spirit
must
i
bear
this
sorrow
in
addition
to
my
others
in
my
fruitless
search
for
rest
my
life
will
be
a
waking
nightmare
most
bitter
irony
of
fate
the
trees
swayed
above
his
head
and
the
moon
in
its
last
quarter
looked
dreamily
at
him
ah
thought
ayrault
could
i
but
sleep
and
be
happy
drowsiness
and
weariness
fatigue
grasp
is
on
me
or
may
sylvia
nearness
soothe
as
her
voice
has
brought
me
calm
quiet
i
may
some
day
enjoy
but
slumber
again
never
i
see
that
souls
in
hades
must
ever
have
their
misdeeds
before
them
happy
man
in
this
world
the
repentant
sins
are
forgiven
you
lose
your
care
in
sleep
somnolence
and
drowsiness
balm
of
aching
hearts
angels
of
mercy
mortals
how
blessed
until
you
die
god
sends
you
this
rest
when
i
recall
summer
evenings
with
sylvia
while
gentle
zephyrs
fanned
our
brows
i
would
change
pope
famous
line
to
never

but
always
has
been
blessed
a
clock
in
a
now
struck

the
sound
ringing
through
the
still
night
air
it
will
soon
be
time
for
ghosts
to
go
thought
ayrault
i
must
not
haunt
her
dwelling
there
was
a
light
in
sylvia
study
and
ayrault
remained
meditatively
gazing
at
it
happy
lamp
he
thought
to
shed
your
light
on
one
so
fair
she
can
see
you
and
you
shine
for
her
you
are
better
off
than
i
would
that
her
soul
might
shine
for
me
as
your
light
shines
for
her
the
light
of
my
life
has
departed
o
that
the
darkness
were
complete
i
am
dead
his
thoughts
ran
on
and
when
the
privilege
bitter
word
that
permits
me
to
remain
here
has
expired
i
must
doubtless
return
to
saturn
and
there
in
purgatory
work
out
my
probation
but
what
comfort
is
it
that
a
few
centuries
hence
i
may
be
able
to
revisit
my
native
earth
the
flowers
will
bloom
in
the
morning
light
and
the
lark
salute
the
sun
the
earth
will
continue
to
roll
through
space
and
i
may
be
nearer
my
final
grace
but
sylvia
will
be
spun
even
sylvia
house
will
be
a
heap
of
ruins
or
its
place
will
be
taken
by
something
else
if
i
had
sylvia
i
should
care
for
nothing
as
i
have
lost
her
even
this
sight
though
sweet
must
always
bring
regret
i
wish
at
all
events
i
might
see
sylvia
if
only
with
these
since
as
a
mortal
she
may
never
gladden
my
sight
again
to
his
surprise
he
now
perceived
that
he
could
see
notwithstanding
the
drawn
shades
sylvia
was
at
her
in
a
wrapper
she
sat
there
resting
her
head
on
her
hand
looking
thoughtful
but
worried
though
it
was
so
late
she
had
not
retired
the
thrush
that
ayrault
had
often
in
life
admired
and
that
she
had
for
some
reason
brought
was
silent
and
asleep
happy
bird
he
said
you
obtain
rest
and
forgetfulness
on
covering
your
head
but
what
wing
can
cover
my
soul
i
used
to
wish
i
might
flutter
towards
heaven
on
natural
wings
like
you
little
thrush
now
i
can
indeed
outfly
you
but
whatever
i
do
i
unhappy
and
wherever
i
go
i
in
hell
what
is
man
in
his
helpless
first
spiritual
state
he
is
but
a
flower
and
withers
soon
had
i
like
the
bishop
been
less
blind
and
obeyed
my
conscience
clear
i
might
have
returned
to
my
native
earth
while
sylvia
still
sojourns
here
and
coming
thus
by
virtue
of
development
i
should
be
able
to
commune
with
her
what
is
life
he
continued
in
the
retrospect
nothing
it
seems
to
me
already
as
but
an
infinitesimal
point
things
that
engrossed
me
and
seemed
of
such
moment
that
overshadowed
the
duty
of
obeying
my
conscience
what
were
they
and
where
ah
where
they
endured
but
a
moment
reality
and
evanescence
evanescence
and
reality
the
light
in
sylvia
room
was
out
now
and
in
the
east
he
beheld
the
dawn
the
ubiquitous
grey
which
he
saw
at
night
was
invaded
by
streams
of
glorious
crimson
and
blue
that
reached
far
up
into
the
sky
he
gazed
at
the
spectacle
and
then
once
more
at
that
house
in
which
his
love
was
centred
would
i
might
be
her
guardian
angel
to
guide
her
in
the
right
and
keep
her
from
all
harm
sleep
on
sylvia
sweet
one
sleep
yon
stars
fade
beside
your
eyes
your
thoughts
and
your
soul
are
fairer
far
than
the
east
in
this
day
sunrise
i
know
what
i
have
lost
ah
desolating
knowledge
for
i
have
read
heart
and
know
i
was
loved
as
truly
as
i
loved
when
bearwarden
and
cortlandt
break
her
the
news
ah
god
will
she
live
and
do
they
yet
know
i
am
dead
again
came
that
spasm
to
shed
spirit
tears
and
had
he
not
known
it
impossible
he
would
have
thought
his
heart
must
break
the
birds
twittered
and
the
light
grew
but
ayrault
lay
with
his
face
upon
the
ground
finally
the
spirit
of
unrest
drove
him
on
he
passed
the
barred
door
of
his
own
house
through
which
he
had
entered
so
often
it
was
unchanged
but
seemed
deserted
next
he
went
to
the
where
he
had
left
his
yacht
invisibly
and
sadly
he
stood
upon
her
upper
deck
and
gazed
at
the
levers
in
response
to
his
touch
on
which
the
craft
had
cleft
the
waves
reversed
or
turned
like
a
thing
of
life
was
a
pretty
toy
he
mused
and
many
hours
of
joy
have
i
had
as
i
floated
through
life
on
board
of
her
as
he
moped
along
he
beheld
two
unkempt
italians
having
a
and
a
violin
the
music
was
not
fine
but
it
touched
a
chord
in
ayrault
breast
for
he
had
waltzed
with
sylvia
to
that
air
and
it
made
his
heart
ache
oh
the
acuteness
of
my
distress
he
cried
the
utter
depth
of
my
sorrow
can
i
have
no
peace
in
death
no
oblivion
in
the
grave
i
am
reminded
of
my
blighted
hopeless
love
in
all
kinds
of
unexpected
ways
by
unforeseen
trifles
oh
would
i
might
indeed
die
may
obliteration
be
my
deliverer
poor
fellows
he
continued
glancing
at
the
italians
for
he
perceived
that
neither
of
the
players
was
happy
the
pianist
was
avaricious
while
the
violinist
natural
and
habitual
jealousy
destroyed
his
peace
of
mind
unhappiness
seems
the
common
lot
thought
ayrault
earth
can
not
give
that
joy
for
which
we
sigh
poor
fellows
though
you
rack
my
ears
and
distress
my
heart
i
can
not
help
you
now
chapter
xiii
the
priest
sermon
it
being
the
first
day
of
the
week
the
morning
air
was
filled
with
chimes
from
many
steeples
divine
service
always
comforted
in
life
thought
ayrault
perchance
it
may
do
so
now
when
i
have
reached
the
state
for
which
it
tried
to
prepare
me
accordingly
he
moved
on
with
the
throng
and
soon
was
ascending
the
heights
of
morningside
park
after
which
he
entered
the
cathedral
the
priest
whose
voice
had
so
often
thrilled
him
stood
at
his
post
in
his
surplice
and
the
choir
had
finished
the
processional
hymn
during
the
responses
in
the
litany
and
between
the
commandments
while
the
congregation
and
the
choir
sang
he
heard
their
natural
voices
as
of
old
ascending
to
the
vaulted
roof
and
arrested
there
he
now
also
heard
their
spiritual
voices
resulting
from
the
earnestness
of
their
prayers
these
were
rung
through
the
vaster
vault
of
space
arousing
a
spiritual
echo
beyond
the
constellations
and
the
nebulae
the
service
which
was
that
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
touched
him
as
deeply
as
usual
after
which
the
rector
ascended
the
steps
to
the
pulpit
the
text
this
morning
he
began
is
from
the
eighth
chapter
of
paul
epistle
to
the
romans
at
the
eighteenth
verse
i
reckon
that
the
sufferings
of
this
present
time
are
not
worthy
to
be
compared
to
the
glory
that
shall
be
revealed
in
us
let
us
suppose
that
you
or
i
brethren
should
become
a
free
and
disembodied
spirit
a
minute
vein
in
the
brain
bursts
or
a
clot
forms
in
the
heart
it
may
be
a
mere
trifle
some
unexpected
thing
yet
the
career
in
the
flesh
is
ended
the
eternal
life
of
the
liberated
spirit
begun
the
soul
slips
from
earth
grasp
as
air
from
our
fingers
and
finds
itself
in
the
frigid
boundless
void
of
space
yet
through
some
longing
this
soul
might
rejoin
us
and
though
invisible
might
hear
the
ring
and
long
to
recall
some
one
of
the
many
bright
sunday
mornings
spent
here
on
earth
has
a
direful
misfortune
befallen
this
brother
or
has
a
slave
been
set
free
let
us
suppose
for
a
moment
that
the
first
has
occurred
of
vanities
said
the
old
preacher
of
calamities
says
the
new
that
soul
probationary
period
is
ended
his
record
on
which
he
must
go
is
forever
made
he
has
been
in
the
flesh
let
us
say
one
two
three
or
four
score
years
before
him
are
the
countless
aeons
of
eternity
he
may
have
had
a
reasonably
satisfactory
life
from
his
point
of
view
and
been
fairly
successful
in
stilling
conscience
that
still
small
voice
doubtless
spoke
pretty
sharply
at
first
but
after
a
while
it
rarely
troubled
him
and
in
the
end
it
spoke
not
at
all
he
may
in
a
way
have
enjoyed
life
and
the
beauties
of
nature
he
has
seen
the
fresh
leaves
come
and
go
but
he
forgot
the
moral
that
be
himself
was
but
a
leaf
and
that
as
they
all
dropped
to
earth
to
make
more
soil
his
ashes
must
also
return
to
the
ground
but
his
soul
friends
and
brethren
what
becomes
of
that
ah
it
is
the
study
of
this
question
that
moistens
our
eyes
with
tears
no
evil
man
is
really
happy
here
and
what
must
be
his
suffering
in
the
cold
cold
land
of
spirits
no
slumber
or
forgetfulness
can
ease
his
lot
in
hades
and
after
his
condemnation
at
the
last
judgment
he
must
forever
face
the
unsoftened
realities
of
eternity
no
evil
thing
or
thought
can
find
lodgment
in
heaven
if
it
could
heaven
would
not
be
a
happy
place
neither
can
any
man
improve
in
the
abyss
of
hell
as
the
horizon
gradually
darkens
and
this
soul
recedes
from
god
the
time
spent
in
the
flesh
must
come
to
seem
the
most
infinitesimal
moment
more
evanescent
than
the
tick
of
a
clock
it
seems
dreadful
that
for
such
short
misdoings
a
soul
should
suffer
so
long
but
no
man
can
be
saved
in
spite
of
himself
he
had
the
opportunities
and
the
knowledge
of
this
must
give
a
soul
the
most
acute
pang
in
revelation
xx
we
find
these
words
and
holy
is
he
that
hath
part
in
the
first
resurrection
on
such
the
second
death
hath
no
power
i
have
often
asked
myself
may
not
this
mean
that
those
with
a
bad
record
in
the
general
resurrection
after
a
time
cease
to
exist
since
all
suffer
one
death
at
the
close
of
their
period
here
this
is
somewhat
suggested
by
proverbs
xii
the
way
of
righteousness
is
life
and
in
the
pathway
thereof
there
is
no
death
this
might
limit
the
everlasting
damnation
so
often
repeated
elsewhere
to
the
lives
of
the
condemned
since
to
them
in
a
sense
it
would
be
everlasting
let
us
now
turn
to
the
bright
picture
the
soul
that
has
weathered
the
storms
of
life
and
has
reached
the
haven
of
rest
the
struggles
temptations
and
trials
overcome
have
done
their
work
of
refining
with
a
rapidity
that
could
not
have
been
equalled
in
any
other
way
and
though
perhaps
very
imperfect
still
the
journey
is
ever
on
the
reward
is
tenfold
yet
in
proportion
to
what
this
soul
has
done
for
we
know
that
the
servant
who
best
used
his
ten
talents
was
made
ruler
over
ten
cities
while
he
that
increased
his
five
talents
by
five
received
five
and
the
saviour
in
whom
he
trusted
by
whose
aid
he
made
his
fight
stands
ready
to
receive
him
saying
thou
into
the
joy
of
thy
lord
as
the
dark
earthly
background
recedes
the
clouds
break
and
the
glorious
light
appears
the
contrast
heightening
the
and
increasing
delights
which
are
as
great
as
the
recipients
have
power
to
enjoy
since
these
righteous
souls
receive
their
rewards
in
proportion
to
the
weight
of
the
crosses
that
they
have
borne
in
the
right
spirit
these
souls
are
a
joy
to
their
creator
and
are
the
heirs
of
him
in
heaven
the
ceaseless
sleepless
activity
that
must
obtain
in
both
paradise
and
hades
and
that
must
make
the
hearts
of
the
godless
grow
faint
at
the
contemplation
is
also
a
boundless
promise
to
those
who
have
him
who
is
all
in
all
where
is
now
thy
saviour
where
is
now
thy
god
the
unjust
man
has
asked
in
his
heart
when
he
saw
his
just
neighbour
struggling
and
unsuccessful
both
the
righteous
and
the
unrighteous
man
are
dead
the
one
has
found
his
saviour
the
other
is
yearly
losing
god
what
is
the
suffering
of
the
present
momentary
time
eased
as
it
is
by
god
mercy
and
presence
compared
with
the
glories
that
await
us
what
would
it
be
if
our
lives
here
were
filled
with
nothing
else
as
ye
know
that
your
labour
is
not
vain
in
the
lord
time
and
eternity
the
finite
and
the
infinite
death
was
indeed
a
deliverer
and
the
sunset
of
the
body
is
the
sunrise
of
the
soul
the
priest
held
himself
erect
as
a
soldier
while
delivering
this
sermon
making
the
great
cathedral
ring
with
his
earnest
and
solemn
voice
while
ayrault
as
a
spirit
saw
how
absolutely
he
meant
and
believed
every
word
that
he
said
nearly
all
the
members
of
the
congregation
were
moved
some
more
some
less
than
they
appeared
after
the
benediction
they
rapidly
dispersed
carrying
in
their
hearts
the
germs
he
had
sown
but
whether
these
would
bear
fruit
or
wither
time
alone
could
show
ayrault
had
noticed
sylvia
father
and
mother
in
church
but
sylvia
herself
was
not
there
and
he
was
distressed
to
think
she
might
be
why
pondered
ayrault
am
i
so
unhappy
i
was
baptized
confirmed
and
have
taken
the
sacrament
i
have
always
had
an
unshaken
faith
and
though
often
unsuccessful
have
striven
to
obey
my
conscience
the
spirits
also
on
saturn
kept
saying
i
should
be
happy
now
did
this
mean
it
was
incumbent
upon
me
to
rejoice
because
of
some
blessing
i
already
had
and
did
not
appreciate
or
did
their
prescience
show
them
some
prospective
happiness
i
was
to
enjoy
the
visions
also
of
violet
the
angel
and
the
lily
which
i
believed
and
still
believe
were
no
mere
empty
fancies
should
have
given
me
the
most
unspeakable
joy
it
may
be
a
mistake
to
apply
earthly
logic
to
heavenly
things
but
the
fundamental
laws
of
science
can
not
change
why
am
i
so
unhappy
he
continued
returning
to
his
original
question
the
visions
gave
promise
of
special
grace
perhaps
some
special
favour
true
my
prayer
to
see
sylvia
was
heard
but
considering
the
sacrifice
this
has
been
no
blessing
the
request
can
not
have
been
wrong
in
itself
and
as
for
the
manner
there
was
no
arrogance
in
my
heart
i
asked
as
a
mortal
as
a
man
of
but
finite
understanding
for
what
concerned
me
most
why
oh
why
so
wretched
chapter
xiv
hic
ille
jacet
at
daybreak
the
passed
off
but
was
followed
by
a
cold
drenching
rain
supposing
ayrault
had
remained
in
the
callisto
bearwarden
and
cortlandt
did
not
feel
anxious
and
not
wishing
to
be
wet
through
remained
in
the
cave
keeping
up
a
good
fire
with
the
wood
they
had
collected
towards
evening
a
cold
wind
came
up
and
thinking
this
might
clear
the
air
they
ventured
out
but
finding
the
ground
saturated
and
that
the
rain
was
again
beginning
to
fall
they
returned
to
shelter
prepared
a
dinner
of
canned
meat
and
made
themselves
as
comfortable
as
possible
for
the
night
i
am
surprised
said
cortlandt
that
dick
did
not
try
to
return
to
us
since
he
had
the
mackintoshes
i
dare
say
he
did
try
replied
bearwarden
but
finding
the
course
inundated
and
knowing
we
should
not
need
the
mackintoshes
if
we
remained
under
cover
decided
to
put
back
the
callisto
is
of
course
as
safe
as
a
church
i
hope
said
cortlandt
no
harm
has
come
to
him
on
the
way
it
will
be
a
weight
off
my
mind
to
see
him
safely
with
us
should
he
not
turn
up
in
the
morning
replied
bearwarden
we
must
begin
a
search
for
him
bright
and
early
making
up
the
fire
as
near
the
entrance
of
the
cave
as
they
could
find
a
dry
place
so
that
ayrault
should
see
it
if
he
attempted
to
return
during
the
night
they
piled
on
wood
and
talked
of
their
recent
experiences
however
unwilling
i
was
said
cortlandt
to
believe
my
senses
which
i
felt
were
misleading
me
i
can
no
longer
doubt
the
reality
of
that
spirit
bishop
or
the
truth
of
what
be
says
when
you
look
at
the
question
dispassionately
it
is
what
you
might
logically
expect
in
my
desire
to
disprove
what
is
to
us
supernatural
i
tried
to
create
mentally
a
system
that
would
be
a
substitute
for
the
one
he
described
but
could
evolve
nothing
that
so
perfectly
filled
the
requirements
or
that
was
so
simple
nothing
seems
more
natural
than
that
man
having
been
evolved
from
stone
should
continue
his
ascent
till
he
discards
material
altogether
the
metamorphism
is
more
striking
in
the
first
change
than
in
the
second
granted
that
the
soul
is
immaterial
and
that
it
leaves
the
body
after
death
what
is
there
to
keep
it
on
earth
gravitation
can
not
affect
it
what
is
more
likely
than
that
it
is
left
behind
by
the
earth
in
its
orbit
or
that
it
continues
its
forward
motion
but
in
a
straight
line
till
reaching
the
paths
of
the
greater
planets
it
is
drawn
to
them
by
some
affinity
or
attraction
that
the
earth
does
not
possess
and
that
the
souls
held
in
that
manner
remain
here
on
probation
developing
like
young
animals
or
children
till
by
gradually
acquired
power
resulting
from
their
wills
they
are
able
to
rise
again
into
space
to
revisit
the
earth
and
in
time
to
explore
the
universe
it
might
easily
come
about
that
by
some
explainable
sympathy
the
infant
good
souls
are
drawn
to
this
planet
while
the
condemned
pass
on
to
cassandra
which
holds
them
by
some
property
peculiar
to
itself
until
perhaps
they
too
by
virtue
of
their
wills
acquire
new
power
unless
involution
sets
in
and
they
lose
what
they
have
the
simplicity
of
the
thing
is
what
surprises
me
now
and
that
for
ages
philosophers
have
been
racking
their
brains
with
every
conceivable
fancy
when
by
simply
extending
and
following
natural
laws
they
could
discern
the
whole
it
is
the
old
story
said
bearwarden
of
columbus
and
the
egg
schopenhouer
and
his
predecessors
appear
to
have
tried
every
idea
but
the
right
one
and
even
darwin
and
huxley
fell
short
in
their
reasoning
because
they
tried
to
obtain
more
or
less
than
four
by
putting
two
with
two
thus
they
sat
and
talked
while
the
night
wore
on
neither
thought
of
sleeping
hoping
all
the
while
that
ayrault
might
walk
in
as
he
had
the
night
before
at
last
the
dawn
began
to
tint
the
east
and
the
growing
light
showed
them
that
the
storm
had
passed
the
upper
strata
of
saturn
atmosphere
being
filled
with
infinitesimal
particles
of
dust
as
a
result
of
its
numerous
volcanoes
the
conditions
were
highly
favourable
to
beautiful
sunrises
and
sunsets
soon
coloured
streaks
extended
far
into
the
sky
and
though
they
knew
that
when
the
sun
disc
appeared
it
would
seem
small
it
filled
the
almost
boundless
eastern
horizon
with
the
most
variegated
and
gorgeous
hues
turning
away
from
the
welcome
sight
for
their
minds
were
ill
at
ease
they
found
the
light
strong
enough
for
their
search
to
begin
writing
on
a
sheet
of
paper
in
a
large
hand
have
gone
to
the
callisto
to
look
for
you
shall
afterwards
return
here
they
pinned
this
in
a
conspicuous
place
and
set
out
due
west
keeping
about
a
hundred
yards
apart
the
ground
was
wet
and
slippery
but
overhead
all
was
clear
and
the
sun
soon
shone
brightly
looking
to
right
and
left
and
occasionally
shouting
and
discharging
their
revolvers
they
went
on
for
half
an
hour
i
have
his
tracks
called
bearwarden
and
cortlandt
hastened
to
join
him
in
the
soft
ground
sure
enough
they
saw
ayrault
footprints
and
from
the
distance
between
them
concluded
that
he
must
have
been
running
or
walking
very
fast
but
the
rain
had
washed
down
the
edges
of
the
incision
the
trail
ascended
a
gentle
slope
where
they
lost
it
but
on
reaching
the
summit
they
saw
it
again
with
the
feet
together
as
though
ayrault
had
paused
and
about
it
were
many
other
impressions
with
the
feet
turned
in
as
if
the
walkers
or
standers
had
surrounded
ayrault
who
was
in
the
centre
i
hope
said
cortlandt
these
are
nothing
more
than
the
footprints
we
have
seen
formed
about
ourselves
see
said
bearwarden
dick
trail
goes
on
and
the
others
vanish
they
can
not
have
been
made
by
savages
or
indians
for
they
seem
to
have
had
weight
only
while
standing
they
then
resumed
their
march
firing
a
revolver
shot
at
intervals
of
a
minute
suddenly
they
came
upon
a
tall
straight
tree
uprooted
by
the
wind
and
lying
diagonally
across
their
path
following
with
their
eyes
the
direction
in
which
it
lay
they
saw
a
large
hollow
trunk
with
the
bark
stripped
off
and
charred
as
if
struck
by
lightning
obliged
to
pass
near
this
by
the
uprooted
thick
trunk
upheld
by
the
branches
at
the
head
lay
raised
about
two
feet
from
the
ground
both
searchers
gave
a
start
and
stood
still
as
if
petrified
inside
the
great
trunk
they
saw
a
head
and
on
looking
more
closely
descried
ayrault
body
grasping
it
by
the
arms
they
drew
it
out
the
face
was
pale
and
the
limbs
were
stiff
instantly
cortlandt
unfastened
the
collar
while
bearwarden
applied
a
flask
to
the
lips
but
they
soon
found
that
their
efforts
were
vain
the
spirit
ejaculated
cortlandt
dick
may
be
in
a
trance
in
which
case
he
can
help
us
let
us
will
hard
and
long
accordingly
they
threw
themselves
on
their
faces
closing
their
eyes
that
nothing
might
distract
their
concentration
minutes
which
seemed
like
ages
passed
and
there
was
no
response
now
said
bearwarden
will
together
hard
suddenly
the
stillness
was
broken
by
the
spirit
voice
which
said
i
felt
more
than
one
mind
calling
but
the
effect
was
so
slight
i
thought
first
i
was
mistaken
i
will
help
you
in
what
you
want
for
the
young
man
is
not
dead
neither
is
he
injured
saying
which
he
stretched
himself
upon
ayrault
worked
his
lungs
artificially
and
willed
with
an
intensity
the
observers
could
feel
where
they
stood
quickly
the
colour
returned
to
cheeks
and
with
the
spirit
assistance
he
sat
up
and
leaned
against
the
tree
that
had
protected
him
from
the
storm
your
promise
was
realized
he
said
addressing
the
spirit
i
have
seen
what
i
shall
never
forget
and
lest
the
anguish
the
vision
of
which
i
saw
come
true
let
us
return
to
the
earth
and
not
leave
it
till
i
have
tasted
in
reality
the
joys
that
in
the
spirit
i
seemed
to
have
missed
i
have
often
longed
in
this
life
to
be
in
the
spirit
but
never
knew
what
longing
was
till
i
experienced
it
as
a
spirit
to
be
once
more
in
the
flesh
you
see
the
mercy
of
god
said
the
spirit
in
not
ordinarily
allowing
the
spirits
of
the
departed
to
revisit
earth
until
they
are
prepared
that
is
until
they
are
sufficiently
advanced
to
go
there
unaided
by
which
time
they
have
come
to
understand
the
wisdom
of
god
laws
in
your
case
the
limiting
laws
were
partially
suspended
so
that
you
were
able
to
return
at
once
with
many
of
the
faculties
and
senses
of
spirits
but
without
their
accumulated
experience
it
speaks
well
for
your
state
of
preparation
that
without
having
had
those
disguised
blessings
illness
or
misfortune
you
were
not
utterly
crushed
by
what
you
saw
when
temporarily
released
while
in
the
trance
you
were
not
in
hell
but
experienced
the
feelings
that
all
mortals
would
if
allowed
to
return
immediately
thus
no
lover
can
return
to
earth
till
his
fiancee
has
joined
him
here
or
till
perceiving
the
benevolence
of
god
ways
he
is
not
distressed
at
what
he
sees
and
has
the
companionship
of
a
host
of
kindred
spirits
the
spirits
you
saw
in
the
cemetery
were
indeed
in
hell
but
had
become
sufficiently
developed
to
revisit
the
earth
though
doing
so
did
not
relieve
their
distress
for
neither
the
development
of
their
senses
which
intensifies
their
capacity
for
remorse
and
regret
nor
their
investigations
into
god
boundless
mercies
which
they
have
deliberately
thrown
away
can
comfort
them
some
of
your
ancestors
are
on
cassandra
and
others
are
in
purgatory
here
though
a
few
faintly
felt
your
prayer
none
were
able
to
return
and
answer
beside
their
graves
it
was
at
your
request
and
prayer
that
he
freed
your
spirit
but
you
see
how
unhappy
it
made
you
i
see
replied
ayrault
that
no
man
should
wish
to
anticipate
the
workings
of
the
almighty
although
i
have
been
unspeakably
blessed
in
that
he
made
an
exception
if
i
may
so
call
it
in
my
favour
since
in
addition
to
revealing
the
responsibilities
of
life
it
has
shown
me
the
inestimable
value
and
loyalty
of
woman
love
i
fear
however
that
my
return
to
earth
greatly
distressed
the
waterer
of
the
flowers
you
showed
me
she
already
sleeps
replied
the
spirit
and
i
have
comforted
her
by
a
dream
in
which
she
sees
that
you
are
well
when
shall
we
start
asked
bearwarden
as
soon
as
you
can
get
ready
replied
ayrault
i
would
not
risk
running
short
of
enough
current
to
generate
the
apergy
needed
to
get
us
back
i
dare
say
when
i
have
been
on
earth
a
few
years
and
have
done
something
for
the
good
of
my
soul
which
as
i
take
it
can
be
accomplished
as
well
by
advancing
science
as
in
any
other
way
i
shall
pine
for
another
journey
in
space
as
i
now
do
to
return
how
i
wish
i
were
engaged
said
bearwarden
glancing
at
cortlandt
and
overjoyed
at
ayrault
recovery
accordingly
they
resumed
their
march
in
the
direction
in
which
they
had
been
going
when
they
found
ayrault
and
were
soon
beside
the
callisto
cortlandt
worked
the
combination
lock
of
the
lower
entrance
through
which
they
crawled
going
to
the
second
story
they
opened
a
large
window
and
let
down
a
ladder
on
which
the
spirit
ascended
at
their
invitation
bearwarden
and
ayrault
immediately
set
about
combining
the
chemicals
that
were
to
produce
the
force
necessary
to
repel
them
from
saturn
bubbles
of
hydrogen
were
given
off
from
the
lead
and
zinc
plates
and
the
viscous
primary
batteries
quickly
had
the
wires
passing
through
a
vacuum
at
a
white
heat
i
see
you
are
nearly
ready
to
start
said
the
spirit
so
i
must
say
farewell
will
you
not
come
with
us
asked
ayrault
no
replied
the
spirit
i
do
not
wish
to
be
away
as
long
as
it
will
take
you
to
reach
the
earth
the
callisto
atmosphere
could
not
absorb
my
body
so
that
should
i
leave
you
before
your
arrival
you
would
be
burdened
with
a
corpse
i
may
visit
you
in
the
spirit
though
the
desire
and
effort
for
communion
with
spirits
to
be
of
most
good
must
needs
come
from
the
earth
ere
long
my
intuition
tells
me
we
shall
meet
again
the
vision
of
your
own
grave
he
continued
addressing
cortlandt
may
not
come
true
for
many
years
but
however
long
your
lives
may
be
according
to
earthly
reckoning
remember
that
when
they
are
past
they
will
seem
to
have
been
hardly
more
than
a
moment
for
they
are
the
personification
of
frailty
and
evanescence
he
held
up
his
hands
and
blessed
them
and
then
repeating
farewell
and
a
happy
return
descended
as
he
had
come
up
the
air
was
filled
with
misty
shadows
and
the
pulsating
hearts
luminous
brains
and
centres
of
spiritual
activity
quivered
with
motion
they
surrounded
the
incarnate
spirit
of
the
bishop
and
set
up
the
soft
musical
hum
the
travellers
had
heard
so
often
since
their
arrival
on
saturn
i
now
understand
thought
ayrault
why
the
spirits
i
met
kept
repeating
that
i
should
be
happy
they
perceived
i
was
to
be
translated
and
though
they
doubtless
knew
what
suffering
it
would
cause
they
also
knew
i
should
be
awakened
to
a
sense
of
great
realities
of
which
i
understood
but
little
they
drew
up
the
ladder
and
turned
on
the
current
and
the
callisto
slowly
began
to
rise
while
the
three
friends
crowded
the
window
called
the
spirit
pleasant
voice
to
which
the
men
replied
in
chorus
the
sun
had
set
on
the
surface
of
the
planet
while
they
made
their
preparations
but
as
the
callisto
rose
higher
it
seemed
to
rise
again
making
the
sides
of
their
car
shine
like
silver
and
carefully
closing
the
two
open
windows
they
watched
the
world
so
many
times
larger
and
more
magnificent
than
their
own
chapter
xv
mother
earth
there
is
something
sad
said
cortlandt
about
the
end
of
everything
but
i
am
more
sorry
to
leave
saturn
than
i
have
ever
been
in
taking
leave
of
any
other
place
when
beyond
the
limits
of
the
atmosphere
they
applied
the
full
current
and
were
soon
once
more
cleaving
the
ether
at
cometary
speed
their
motion
towards
the
sun
being
aided
by
that
great
body
itself
they
quickly
passed
beyond
the
outer
edge
of
the
vast
silvery
rings
and
then
crossed
one
after
another
the
orbits
of
the
moons
from
the
last
of
which
iapetus
they
obtained
their
final
course
in
the
direction
of
the
earth
they
had
an
acute
feeling
of
homesickness
for
the
mysterious
planet
on
which
while
yet
mortal
they
had
found
paradise
and
had
communed
with
spirits
as
no
modern
men
ever
did
without
deviating
from
their
almost
straight
line
they
passed
within
a
million
miles
of
jupiter
which
had
gained
in
its
smaller
orbit
on
saturn
and
a
few
days
later
crossed
the
track
of
mars
as
the
earth
had
completed
nearly
half
a
revolution
in
its
orbit
since
their
departure
they
here
turned
somewhat
to
the
right
by
attracting
the
ruddy
planet
in
order
to
avoid
passing
too
near
the
sun
on
some
future
expedition
said
ayrault
and
when
we
have
a
supply
of
blue
glasses
we
can
take
a
trip
to
venus
if
we
can
find
a
possible
season
in
her
year
compared
with
this
journey
it
would
be
only
like
going
round
the
block
two
days
later
they
had
rounded
the
sun
and
laid
their
course
in
pursuit
of
the
earth
that
the
astronomers
in
the
dark
hemisphere
were
at
their
posts
and
saw
them
was
evident
for
a
brilliant
beam
of
light
again
flashed
forth
this
time
from
a
point
a
little
south
of
the
arctic
circle
and
after
shining
one
minute
telegraphed
this
message
rejoiced
to
see
you
again
hope
all
are
well
since
they
were
not
sufficiently
near
the
moon
shadow
they
directed
their
into
their
own
which
trailed
off
on
one
side
and
answered
all
well
thank
you
have
wonderful
things
to
relate
the
men
at
the
telescopes
then
as
before
read
the
message
and
telephoned
the
light
this
next
question
when
are
you
coming
down
that
we
may
notify
the
newspapers
we
wish
one
more
sight
of
the
earth
from
this
height
by
daylight
we
are
now
swinging
to
get
between
it
and
the
sun
we
have
erected
a
monument
in
van
cortlandt
park
and
engraved
upon
it
this
place
james
bearwarden
henry
chelmsford
cortlandt
and
richard
rokeby
ayrault
left
earth
december
to
visit
jupiter
add
to
it
returned
on
the
of
the
following
june
soon
the
callisto
came
nearly
between
the
earth
and
the
sun
when
the
astronomers
could
see
it
only
through
darkened
glasses
and
it
appeared
almost
as
a
crescent
the
sight
the
travellers
then
beheld
was
superb
it
was
about
in
london
and
europe
was
spread
before
them
like
a
map
all
its
peninsulas
and
islands
enclosed
blue
seas
and
bays
came
out
in
clear
relief
gradually
russia
germany
france
the
british
isles
and
spain
moved
towards
the
horizon
as
in
grand
procession
and
at
the
same
time
the
western
hemisphere
appeared
the
hour
of
day
at
the
longitude
above
which
they
hung
was
about
the
same
as
when
they
set
out
but
the
sun
shone
far
more
directly
upon
the
northern
hemisphere
than
then
and
instead
of
bleak
december
this
was
the
leafy
month
of
june
they
were
loath
to
end
the
lovely
scene
and
would
fain
have
remained
where
they
were
while
the
earth
revolved
again
but
remembering
that
their
friends
must
by
this
time
be
waiting
they
shut
off
the
repulsion
from
the
earth
we
need
not
apply
the
apergy
to
the
earth
until
quite
near
said
ayrault
since
a
great
part
of
the
top
speed
will
be
taken
off
by
the
resistance
of
the
atmosphere
especially
as
we
go
in
base
first
we
have
only
to
keep
a
sufficiently
strong
repulsion
on
the
dome
to
prevent
our
turning
over
and
to
see
that
our
speed
is
not
great
enough
to
heat
the
car
when
about
fifty
miles
from
the
surface
they
felt
the
expected
check
and
concluded
they
had
reached
the
upper
limits
of
the
atmosphere
and
this
increased
notwithstanding
the
decrease
in
their
speed
showing
how
quickly
the
air
became
dense
when
about
a
mile
from
the
earth
they
had
the
callisto
well
in
hand
and
allowed
it
to
descend
slowly
the
ground
was
already
black
with
people
who
having
learned
where
the
callisto
was
to
touch
had
hastened
to
van
cortlandt
park
i
am
overjoyed
to
see
you
said
sylvia
when
she
and
ayrault
met
i
had
the
most
dreadful
presentiment
that
something
had
gone
wrong
with
you
one
afternoon
and
evening
i
was
so
perplexed
and
during
the
night
had
a
series
of
nightmares
that
i
shall
never
forget
i
really
believed
you
were
near
me
but
your
nature
seemed
to
have
changed
for
instead
of
its
making
me
happy
i
was
frightfully
distressed
the
next
day
i
was
very
ill
and
unable
to
get
up
but
during
the
morning
i
fell
asleep
and
had
another
dream
which
was
intensely
realistic
and
made
me
believe
yes
convinced
me
that
you
were
well
after
that
dream
i
soon
recovered
but
oh
the
anguish
of
the
first
ayrault
did
not
tell
her
then
that
he
had
been
near
her
and
of
his
unspeakable
suffering
of
which
hers
had
been
but
the
echo
three
weeks
later
a
clergyman
tied
the
knot
that
was
to
unite
them
forever
while
sylvia
and
ayrault
were
standing
up
to
receive
the
congratulations
of
their
friends
bearwarden
in
shaking
his
hand
said
remember
we
have
been
to
neither
uranus
nor
neptune
nor
cassandra
which
may
be
as
interesting
as
anything
we
have
seen
should
you
want
to
take
another
trip
count
me
as
your
humble
servant
and
cortlandt
following
behind
him
said
the
same
thing
shortly
after
this
sylvia
went
to
change
her
dress
and
when
she
came
down
she
and
ayrault
set
out
on
their
journey
together
through
life
amid
a
chorus
of
cheers
and
a
shower
of
rice
cortlandt
then
returned
to
his
department
at
washington
and
bearwarden
resumed
his
duties
with
the
terrestrial
axis
straightening
company
in
the
presidential
chair
