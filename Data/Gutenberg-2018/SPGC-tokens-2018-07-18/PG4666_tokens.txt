introduction
hazlitt
wrote
that
of
the
three
notable
writers
whom
the
eighteenth
century
had
produced
in
the
north
american
colonies
one
was
the
author
whoever
he
was
of
the
american
farmer
letters
crevecoeur
was
that
unknown
author
and
hazlitt
said
further
of
him
that
he
rendered
in
his
own
vividly
characteristic
manner
not
only
the
objects
but
the
feelings
of
a
new
country
great
is
the
essayist
relish
for
passages
descriptive
of
a
battle
between
two
snakes
of
the
dazzling
almost
invisible
flutter
of
the
bird
wing
of
the
manners
of
the
nantucket
people
their
frank
simplicity
and
festive
rejoicings
after
the
perils
and
hardships
of
the
the
power
to
sympathise
with
nature
without
thinking
of
ourselves
or
others
if
it
is
not
a
definition
of
genius
comes
very
near
to
it
writes
hazlitt
of
our
author
and
his
references
to
crevecoeur
are
closed
with
the
remark
we
have
said
enough
of
this
illustrious
obscure
for
it
is
the
rule
of
criticism
to
praise
none
but
the
and
to
offer
fresh
incense
to
the
idol
of
the
day
others
at
least
have
followed
that
rule
of
criticism
and
the
american
farmer
has
long
enjoyed
undisturbed
seclusion
only
once
since
the
eighteenth
century
has
there
been
a
new
edition
of
his
letters
that
were
first
published
at
london
in
and
reissued
with
a
few
corrections
in
the
next
year
the
original
american
edition
of
this
book
about
america
was
that
published
at
philadelphia
in
and
there
was
no
reprint
till
footnote
references
may
be
found
to
american
editions
of
and
but
no
copies
of
such
editions
are
preserved
in
any
library
to
which
the
editor
has
had
access
when
careless
editing
did
all
it
could
to
destroy
the
value
of
the
work
the
name
of
whose
very
author
was
misstated
yet
the
facts
which
we
have
concerning
him
are
few
enough
to
merit
truthful
presentation
i
except
by
naturalisation
the
author
of
letters
from
an
american
farmer
was
not
an
american
and
he
was
no
ordinary
farmer
yet
why
quarrel
with
him
for
the
naming
of
his
book
or
for
his
signing
it
hector
when
the
hector
of
his
and
american
biographers
was
only
a
prenom
de
faintaisie
we
owe
some
concessions
to
the
author
of
so
charming
a
book
to
the
century
thoreau
his
life
is
certainly
more
interesting
than
the
real
thoreau
and
would
be
even
if
it
did
not
present
many
contradictions
our
records
of
that
life
are
in
the
highest
degree
inexact
he
himself
is
wanting
in
accuracy
as
to
the
date
of
more
than
one
event
the
records
however
agree
that
crevecoeur
belonged
to
the
petite
noblesse
of
normandy
the
date
of
his
birth
was
january
the
place
was
caen
and
his
full
name
his
grandson
and
biographer
vouches
for
it
was
de
crevecoeur
the
boy
was
well
enough
brought
up
but
without
more
than
the
attention
that
his
birth
gave
him
the
right
to
expect
he
divided
the
years
of
his
boyhood
between
caen
where
his
stood
and
the
college
du
mont
where
the
jesuits
gave
him
his
education
a
letter
dated
and
addressed
to
his
children
tells
us
all
that
we
know
of
his
though
it
is
said
too
that
he
distinguished
himself
in
mathematics
if
you
only
knew
the
reminiscent
father
of
a
family
exclaims
in
this
letter
in
what
shabby
lodging
in
what
a
dark
and
chilly
closet
i
was
mewed
up
at
your
age
with
what
severity
i
was
treated
how
i
was
fed
and
dressed
already
his
powers
of
observation
that
were
so
to
distinguish
him
were
quickened
by
his
milieu
from
my
earliest
youth
he
wrote
in
i
had
a
passion
for
taking
in
all
the
antiques
that
i
met
with
furniture
tapestries
family
portraits
gothic
manuscripts
that
i
had
learned
how
to
decipher
had
for
me
an
indefinable
charm
a
little
later
on
i
loved
to
walk
in
the
solitude
of
cemeteries
to
examine
the
tombs
and
to
trace
out
their
mossy
epitaphs
i
knew
most
of
the
churches
of
the
canton
the
date
of
their
foundation
and
what
they
contained
of
interest
in
the
way
of
pictures
and
sculptures
the
boy
gift
of
accurate
and
keen
observation
was
to
be
tested
soon
by
a
very
different
class
of
objects
there
were
to
be
no
crumbling
saints
and
canvases
of
grooms
for
him
to
study
in
the
forests
of
america
no
reminders
of
the
greatness
of
his
country
past
and
the
honour
of
his
family
from
school
the
future
woodsman
passed
over
into
england
a
distant
relative
was
living
near
salisbury
for
one
reason
or
another
the
boy
was
sent
thither
to
finish
his
schooling
from
england
with
what
motives
we
know
not
he
set
out
for
the
new
world
where
he
was
to
spend
his
busiest
and
happiest
days
in
the
bibliotheca
americana
nova
rich
makes
the
statement
that
crevecoeur
was
but
sixteen
when
he
made
the
plunge
and
others
have
followed
rich
in
this
error
the
lad
age
was
really
not
less
than
nineteen
or
twenty
according
to
the
family
legend
his
ship
touched
at
lisbon
on
the
way
out
one
can
not
decide
whether
this
was
just
before
or
immediately
after
the
great
earthquake
then
to
new
france
where
he
joined
montcalm
entering
the
service
as
cadet
he
advanced
to
the
rank
of
lieutenant
was
mentioned
in
the
gazette
shared
in
the
french
successes
drew
maps
of
the
forests
and
that
found
their
way
to
the
king
cabinet
served
with
montcalm
in
the
attack
upon
fort
william
henry
with
that
the
record
is
broken
off
we
can
less
definitely
associate
his
name
with
the
humiliation
of
the
french
in
america
than
with
their
brief
triumphs
yet
it
is
quite
certain
says
robert
de
crevecoeur
his
descendant
that
he
did
not
return
to
france
with
the
of
the
defeated
army
quebec
fell
before
wolfe
attack
in
september
at
some
time
in
the
course
of
the
year
we
may
suppose
the
young
officer
to
have
entered
the
british
colonies
to
have
adopted
his
family
name
of
saint
john
and
to
have
gradually
worked
his
way
south
probably
by
the
hudson
the
reader
of
the
letters
hardly
supposes
him
to
have
enjoyed
his
frontier
life
nor
is
there
any
means
of
knowing
how
much
of
that
life
it
was
his
fortune
to
lead
in
time
he
found
himself
as
far
south
as
pennsylvania
he
visited
shippensburg
and
lancaster
and
carlisle
perhaps
he
resided
at
or
near
one
of
these
towns
many
years
later
when
his
son
louis
purchased
a
farm
of
two
hundred
acres
from
chancellor
livingstone
at
navesink
near
the
blue
mountains
crevecoeur
the
elder
was
still
remembered
and
it
may
have
been
at
this
epoch
that
he
visited
the
place
during
the
term
of
his
military
service
under
montcalm
crevecoeur
saw
something
of
the
great
lakes
and
the
outlying
country
prior
to
his
experience
as
a
cultivator
and
indeed
after
he
had
settled
down
as
such
he
travelled
like
plato
even
visited
bermuda
by
his
own
account
not
until
however
have
we
any
positive
evidence
of
his
whereabouts
it
was
in
april
of
that
year
that
he
took
out
naturalisation
papers
at
new
york
some
months
later
he
installed
himself
on
the
farm
variously
called
greycourt
and
in
the
same
state
he
drained
a
great
marsh
there
and
seems
to
have
practised
agriculture
upon
a
generous
scale
the
certificate
of
the
marriage
of
crevecoeur
to
mehitable
tippet
of
yonkers
is
dated
september
and
of
this
union
three
children
were
the
issue
and
more
than
children
for
with
the
marriage
ceremony
once
performed
by
the
worthy
tetard
a
clergyman
of
new
york
formerly
settled
over
a
french
reformed
church
at
charleston
south
carolina
crevecoeur
is
more
definitely
than
ever
the
american
farmer
he
has
thrown
in
his
lot
with
that
new
country
his
children
are
to
be
called
after
their
parent
adopted
name
the
responsibilities
of
the
adventurer
are
multiplied
his
life
in
america
has
become
a
matter
more
easy
to
trace
and
richer
perhaps
in
meaning
ii
one
of
the
historians
of
american
literature
has
written
that
these
letters
furnish
a
greater
number
of
delightful
pages
than
any
other
book
written
in
america
during
the
eighteenth
century
save
only
franklin
autobiography
a
safe
compliment
this
and
yet
does
not
the
very
emptiness
of
american
annals
during
the
eighteenth
century
make
for
our
cherishing
all
that
they
offer
of
the
vivid
and
the
significant
professor
moses
coit
tyler
long
ago
suggested
what
was
the
literary
influence
of
the
american
farmer
whose
idealised
treatment
of
rural
life
in
america
wrought
quite
traceable
effects
upon
the
imaginations
of
campbell
byron
southey
coleridge
and
furnished
not
a
few
materials
for
such
captivating
and
airy
schemes
of
literary
colonisation
in
america
as
that
of
hazlitt
praised
the
book
to
his
friends
and
as
we
have
seen
commended
it
to
readers
of
the
edinburgh
review
lamb
mentions
it
in
one
of
his
letters
which
is
already
some
distinction
yet
when
was
a
book
more
completely
lost
to
popular
view
even
among
the
books
that
have
deserved
oblivion
the
letters
were
published
all
the
same
at
belfast
and
dublin
and
philadelphia
as
well
as
at
london
they
were
recast
in
french
by
the
author
translated
into
german
and
dutch
by
pirating
and
given
a
sequel
by
a
publisher
at
paris
footnote

the
work
so
offered
seems
to
have
been
a
translation
of
john
filson
history
of
kentucky
wilmington
the
american
fanner
made
his
first
public
appearance
eleven
years
before
chateaubriand
found
a
publisher
for
his
essai
sur
les
revolutions
wherein
the
great
innovator
first
used
the
american
materials
that
he
worked
over
more
effectively
in
his
travels
tales
and
memoirs
in
de
crevecoeur
we
have
a
contemporary
a
correspondent
even
of
franklin
but
if
our
author
shared
many
of
poor
richard
interests
one
may
travel
far
without
finding
a
more
complete
antithesis
to
that
philosopher
crevecoeur
expresses
mild
wonderment
that
while
so
many
travellers
visit
italy
and
the
town
of
pompey
under
ground
few
come
to
the
new
continent
where
may
be
studied
not
what
is
found
in
books
but
the
humble
rudiments
and
embryos
of
society
spreading
everywhere
the
recent
foundations
of
our
towns
and
the
settlements
of
so
many
rural
districts
in
the
course
of
his
sixteen
or
seventeen
experience
as
an
american
farmer
he
himself
studied
all
these
matters
and
he
gives
us
a
charming
picture
of
them
though
his
book
has
very
little
obvious
system
its
author
describes
for
us
frontier
and
farm
the
ways
of
the
nantucket
fishermen
and
their
intrepid
wives
life
in
the
middle
colonies
the
refinements
and
atrocities
of
charleston
crevecoeur
account
of
the
south
that
he
knew
but
superficially
and
who
knows
more
it
may
be
by
anecdotes
than
through
personal
knowledge
is
the
least
satisfactory
part
of
his
performance
one
feels
it
to
be
the
most
literary
portion
of
a
book
whose
beauty
is
naivete
but
whether
we
accept
or
reject
the
story
of
the
negro
malefactor
hung
in
a
cage
from
a
tree
and
pecked
at
by
crows
it
is
certain
that
the
traveller
justly
regarded
slavery
as
the
one
conspicuous
blot
on
the
new
shield
crevecoeur
was
not
an
active
abolitionist
like
that
other
naturalised
frenchman
benezet
of
philadelphia
he
had
his
own
slaves
to
work
his
northern
farms
he
was
however
a
man
of
humane
feelings
one
who
had
his
doubts
footnote
in
his
voyage
dans
la
haute
pensylvanie
sic
et
dans
de
new
york
paris
slavery
is
severely
attacked
by
crevecoeur
his
descendant
robert
de
crevecoeur
refers
to
him
as
a
friend
of
wilberforce
and
his
narrative
description
of
life
in
the
american
colonies
in
the
years
immediately
preceding
the
revolution
is
one
that
social
historians
can
not
ignore
though
our
farmer
emphasises
his
plainness
and
promises
the
readers
of
his
letters
only
a
account
of
his
pursuits
he
has
his
full
share
of
sensibility
since
he
is
however
at
many
removes
from
the
sophistications
of
london
and
paris
he
is
moved
not
by
the
fond
behaviour
of
a
or
the
little
arrangements
carters
make
with
the
bridles
of
their
faithful
asses
that
they
have
driven
to
death
belike
but
by
such
matters
as
he
finds
at
home
when
i
contemplate
my
wife
by
my
while
she
either
spins
knits
darns
or
suckles
our
child
i
can
not
describe
the
various
emotions
of
love
of
gratitude
or
conscious
pride
which
thrill
in
my
heart
and
often
overflow
in
voluntary
tears
he
is
like
that
old
classmate
of
fitzgerald
buried
deep
in
one
of
the
most
villages
in
all
england
for
if
he
goes
abroad
it
is
always
involuntary
i
never
return
home
without
feeling
some
pleasant
emotion
which
i
often
suppress
as
useless
and
foolish
he
has
his
reveries
but
they
are
pure
and
generous
their
subject
is
the
future
of
his
children
in
midwinter
instead
of
trapping
and
murthering
the
quail
often
in
the
angles
of
the
fences
where
the
motion
of
the
wind
prevents
the
snow
from
settling
i
carry
them
both
chaff
and
grain
the
one
to
feed
them
the
other
to
prevent
their
tender
feet
from
freezing
fast
to
the
earth
as
i
have
frequently
observed
them
to
do
his
love
of
birds
is
marked
this
in
those
provinces
of
which
a
german
traveller
wrote
in
the
thrush
kind
america
is
poor
there
is
only
the
robin
there
are
no
sparrows
very
few
birds
nest
in
the
woods
a
solemn
stillness
prevails
through
them
interrupted
only
by
the
screaming
of
the
crows
it
is
good
after
such
a
passage
as
this
has
been
quoted
to
set
down
what
crevecoeur
says
of
the
bird
kingdom
in
the
spring
he
writes
i
generally
rise
from
bed
about
that
indistinct
interval
which
properly
speaking
is
neither
night
nor
day
for
then
it
is
that
he
enjoys
the
universal
vocal
choir
he
continues
more
and
more
lyrically
who
can
listen
unmoved
to
the
sweet
of
our
robins
told
from
tree
to
tree
or
to
the
shrill
cat
birds
the
sublime
accents
of
the
thrush
from
on
high
always
retard
my
steps
that
i
may
listen
to
the
delicious
music
and
the
farmer
is
no
less
interested
in
the
astonishing
art
which
all
birds
display
in
the
construction
of
their
nests
ill
provided
as
we
may
suppose
them
with
proper
tools
their
neatness
their
convenience
at
some
time
during
his
american
residence
he
gathered
the
materials
for
an
unpublished
study
of
ants
and
his
bees
proved
an
unfailing
source
of
entertainment
their
government
their
industry
their
quarrels
their
passions
always
present
me
with
something
new
he
writes
adding
that
he
is
most
often
to
be
found
in
hours
of
rest
under
the
locust
tree
where
his
beehive
stands
by
their
movements
says
he
i
can
predict
the
weather
and
can
tell
the
day
of
their
swarming
when
other
men
go
hunting
game
he
goes
such
are
the
matters
he
tells
of
in
his
letters
one
difference
from
the
stereotyped
sensibility
of
the
old
world
one
may
discover
in
the
openness
of
crevecoeur
heart
and
that
is
the
completeness
of
his
interest
in
all
the
humbler
sorts
of
natural
phenomena
nature
is
for
him
no
mere
bundle
of
poetic
properties
soiled
by
much
handling
but
something
fresh
and
inviting
and
full
of
interest
to
a
man
alive
he
takes
more
pleasure
in
hunting
bees
than
in
expeditions
with
his
dogs
and
gun
the
birds
destroy
his
bees
but
he
adds
they
drive
the
crows
away
ordinarily
he
could
not
persuade
himself
to
shoot
them
on
one
occasion
however
he
fired
at
a
more
than
commonly
impertinent
specimen
and
immediately
opened
his
maw
from
which
i
took
bees
i
laid
them
all
on
a
blanket
in
the
sun
and
to
my
great
surprise
returned
to
life
licked
themselves
clean
and
joyfully
went
back
to
the
hive
where
they
probably
informed
their
companions
of
such
an
adventure
and
escape
as
i
believe
had
never
happened
before
to
american
bees
must
one
regard
this
as
a
fable
it
is
by
no
means
as
remarkable
a
yarn
as
one
may
find
told
by
other
naturalists
of
the
same
century
there
is
for
example
that
undated
letter
of
john
bartram
in
which
he
makes
inquiries
of
his
brother
william
concerning
ye
wonderful
flower
footnote
see
a
botanical
marvel
in
the
nation
new
york
august
there
is
too
kalm
report
of
bartram
bear
when
a
bear
catches
a
cow
he
kills
her
in
the
following
manner
he
bites
a
hole
into
the
hide
and
blows
with
all
his
power
into
it
till
the
animal
swells
excessively
and
dies
for
the
air
expands
greatly
between
the
flesh
and
the
hide
after
these
fine
fancies
where
is
the
improbability
of
crevecoeur
modest
adaptation
of
the
that
he
applies
to
the
and
his
bees
the
episode
suggests
for
that
matter
a
chapter
in
mitchell
my
farm
at
edgewood
mitchell
a
later
american
farmer
describes
the
same
the
same
bees
has
too
the
same
supremely
gentle
spirit
i
have
not
the
heart
to
shoot
at
the
nor
do
i
enter
very
actively
into
the
battle
of
the
bees
i
give
them
fair
play
good
lodging
limitless
flowers
willows
bending
as
virgil
advises
into
the
quiet
water
of
a
near
pool
i
have
even
read
up
the
stories
of
a
poor
blind
huber
who
so
dearly
loved
the
bees
and
the
poem
of
giovanni
rucellai
for
their
benefit
can
the
reader
state
without
stopping
to
consider
which
author
it
was
that
wrote
thus
mitchell
or
crevecoeur
certainly
it
is
the
essential
modernity
of
the
earlier
writer
style
that
most
impresses
one
after
the
charm
of
his
pictures
his
was
the
age
of
william
livingston
later
governor
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
in
the
very
year
when
a
london
publisher
was
bringing
out
the
first
edition
of
the
letters
livingston
described
on
his
as
a
young
gentleman
educated
at
yale
college
brought
out
his
philosophic
solitude
at
trenton
in
his
native
state
it
is
worth
quoting
philosophic
solitude
for
the
sake
of
the
comparison
to
be
drawn
between
crevecoeur
prose
and
contemporary
american
verse
let
ardent
heroes
seek
renown
in
arms
pant
after
fame
and
rush
to
war
alarms
mine
be
the
pleasures
of
a
rural
life
the
thought
is
after
all
the
same
as
that
which
we
have
found
less
directly
phrased
in
crevecoeur
but
let
us
quote
the
lines
that
follow
the
exordium
now
we
should
find
the
poet
unconstrained
and
me
to
sequestred
scenes
ye
muses
guide
where
nature
wantons
in
her
to
mossy
banks
edg
round
with
elysian
fields
and
amaranthin
welcome
ye
shades
all
hail
ye
vernal
blooms
ye
thickets
and
prophetic
glooms
ye
forests
hail
ye
solitary
woods
and
the
solitary
woods
rhyming
with
floods
are
a
good
place
to
leave
the
young
gentleman
educated
at
yale
college
livingston
was
plainly
enough
a
poet
of
his
time
and
place
he
had
a
fine
eye
for
nature
seen
through
library
windows
he
echoed
goldsmith
and
a
whole
line
of
british
poets
echoed
them
atrociously
that
one
finds
no
echoes
in
crevecoeur
is
one
of
our
reasons
for
praising
his
spontaneity
and
vigour
he
did
not
import
nightingales
into
his
america
as
some
of
the
poets
did
he
blazed
away
rather
toward
our
present
day
appreciation
of
surrounding
nature
which
was
not
banal
then
crevecoeur
honest
and
unconventionalised
love
of
his
rural
environment
is
great
enough
to
bridge
the
difference
between
the
eighteenth
and
the
twentieth
century
it
is
as
easy
for
us
to
pass
a
happy
evening
with
him
as
it
was
for
thomas
campbell
figuring
to
himself
a
realisation
of
cowley
dreams
and
of
rousseau
poetic
seclusion
till
at
last
in
southey
words
comes
an
indian
with
a
tomahawk
and
scalps
me
a
most
melancholy
proof
that
society
is
very
bad
it
is
the
freshness
the
youthfulness
of
these
letters
after
their
century
and
more
of
that
is
least
likely
to
escape
us
and
this
farmer
in
pennsylvania
is
almost
as
unmistakably
of
kin
with
good
gilbert
white
of
selborne
as
he
is
the
american
thoreau
forerunner
iii
it
is
time
indeed
that
we
made
the
discovery
that
crevecoeur
was
a
modern
he
was
too
a
dweller
in
the
young
republic
even
before
it
was
a
republic
twice
a
year
he
had
the
pleasure
of
catching
pigeons
whose
numbers
are
sometimes
so
astonishing
as
to
obscure
the
sun
in
their
flight
there
is
then
no
poetic
licence
about
longfellow
description
in
evangeline
of
how
a
pestilence
fell
on
the
city
presaged
by
wondrous
signs
and
mostly
by
flocks
of
wild
pigeons
darkening
the
sun
in
their
flight
with
naught
in
their
craws
but
an
acorn
longfellow
could
have
cited
as
his
authority
for
this
flight
of
pigeons
mathew
carey
record
of
the
malignant
fever
lately
prevalent
published
at
philadelphia
which
to
be
sure
discusses
a
different
epidemic
but
tells
us
that
amongst
the
country
people
large
quantities
of
wild
pigeons
in
the
spring
are
regarded
as
certain
indications
of
an
unhealthy
summer
whether
or
not
this
prognostic
has
ever
been
verified
i
can
not
tell
but
it
is
very
certain
that
during
the
last
spring
the
numbers
of
these
birds
brought
to
market
were
immense
never
perhaps
were
there
so
many
before
carey
wrote
in
the
year
as
has
been
noted
of
the
first
american
reprint
of
the
letters
that
had
first
been
published
at
london
carey
was
himself
crevecoeur
american
publisher
and
he
may
well
have
thought
as
he
wrote
the
lines
quoted
of
earlier
pigeons
obscuring
the
sun
in
their
flight
crevecoeur
had
by
this
time
returned
to
france
and
was
never
more
to
ply
the
avocations
of
the
american
farmer
in
the
interval
much
had
happened
to
this
victim
of
both
the
revolutions
though
the
letters
are
distinguished
by
an
idyllic
temper
over
them
is
thrown
the
shadow
of
impending
civil
war
the
farmer
was
a
man
of
peace
for
all
his
experience
under
montcalm
in
canada
and
even
there
his
part
was
rather
an
engineer
than
a
combatant
he
long
hoped
therefore
that
peaceful
counsels
would
prevail
and
that
england
and
the
colonies
would
somehow
come
to
an
understanding
without
hostilities
then
after
the
americans
had
boldly
broken
with
the
home
government
he
lent
them
all
his
sympathy
but
not
his
arms
he
had
his
family
to
watch
over
likewise
his
two
farms
one
in
orange
county
new
york
one
in
new
jersey
as
it
was
the
indians
in
the
royal
service
burned
his
new
jersey
estate
and
after
his
first
return
to
france
he
was
called
thither
by
his
father
we
are
told
though
we
know
nothing
of
the
motives
of
this
recall
he
entered
upon
a
new
phase
of
his
career
after
his
first
return
to
france
i
have
said
as
if
that
had
been
an
entirely
simple
matter
one
can
not
here
describe
all
its
alleged
difficulties
his
arrest
at
new
york
as
a
suspected
spy
though
after
having
secured
a
pass
from
the
american
commander
general
macdougal
he
had
secured
a
second
pass
from
general
clinton
and
permission
to
embark
for
france
his
detention
in
the
provost
prison
in
new
york
the
final
embarkation
with
his
oldest
son
this
on
september
the
shipwreck
which
he
described
as
occurring
off
the
irish
coast
his
residence
for
some
months
in
great
britain
and
during
a
part
of
that
time
in
london
where
he
sold
the
manuscript
of
the
letters
for
thirty
guineas
one
would
like
to
know
crevecoeur
emotions
on
finally
reaching
france
and
joining
his
father
and
relatives
at
caen
one
would
like
to
describe
his
romantic
succour
of
five
american
seamen
who
had
escaped
from
an
english
prison
and
crossed
the
channel
in
a
sloop
to
normandy
a
cousin
of
one
of
these
seamen
a
captain
fellowes
of
boston
was
later
to
befriend
crevecoeur
daughter
and
younger
son
in
the
new
country
that
was
after
the
loyalists
and
their
indian
allies
had
destroyed
the
farmer
house
at
pine
hill
after
his
wife
had
fled
to
westchester
with
her
two
children
and
had
died
there
soon
after
leaving
them
unprotected
but
all
this
must
in
nautical
phrase
go
by
the
board
including
the
novel
founded
upon
the
episode
nor
can
we
linger
over
crevecoeur
entry
into
polite
society
both
in
the
norman
capital
and
at
paris
fancy
the
returned
prodigal
if
one
may
so
describe
him
in
the
salon
of
madame
rousseau
former
mistress
he
was
fairly
launched
this
american
farmer
in
the
society
of
the
lettres
twice
a
week
he
wrote
some
years
after
i
went
with
de
turgot
to
see
the
duchesse
de
beauvilliers
his
sister
and
another
i
went
with
him
to
the
comte
de
buffon
it
was
at
the
table
of
de
buffon
it
was
in
his
salon
during
long
winter
evenings
that
i
was
awakened
once
more
to
the
graces
the
beauties
the
timid
purity
of
our
tongue
which
during
my
long
sojourn
in
north
america
had
become
foreign
to
me
and
of
which
i
had
almost
lost
command
though
not
the
memory
madame
presented
crevecoeur
to
the
families
of
la
rochefoucauld
liancourt
breteuil
beauvau
necker
to
the
academicians
la
harpe
grimm
suard
rulbriere
to
the
delille
we
have
in
the
memoires
of
brissot
an
allusion
to
his
entrance
into
this
society
under
the
wing
of
his
elderly
protectress
proud
of
possessing
an
american
savage
she
wished
to
form
him
and
to
launch
him
in
society
he
had
the
good
sense
to
refuse
and
to
confine
himself
to
the
picked
society
of
men
of
letters
it
was
at
a
later
period
that
brissot
and
crevecoeur
were
to
meet
their
quarrel
naturally
came
later
still
madame
did
more
than
entertain
the
farmer
whose
father
had
been
one
of
her
oldest
friends
she
secured
his
nomination
as
to
the
united
states
now
recognised
by
france
it
was
at
new
york
that
he
took
up
residence
through
the
influence
of
madame
and
her
friends
he
retained
the
appointment
through
the
stormy
years
that
followed
though
in
the
end
he
was
obliged
to
make
way
for
a
successor
more
in
sympathy
with
the
violent
republicanism
of
the
age
throughout
the
years
of
the
french
revolution
the
lived
a
life
of
retirement
and
if
never
of
conspicuous
danger
of
embarrassment
enough
and
of
humiliation
we
need
not
discuss
those
years
spent
at
paris
or
the
visits
paid
after
the
close
of
the
revolution
to
his
and
daughter
for
his
daughter
was
married
to
a
french
secretary
of
legation
who
became
a
count
of
the
empire
now
he
was
in
paris
or
the
suburbs
now
in
london
or
munich
five
years
of
the
later
life
were
spent
at
the
bavarian
capital
maximilian
entertained
him
there
and
told
him
that
he
had
read
his
book
with
the
keenest
pleasure
and
great
profit
too
he
busied
himself
in
preparing
his
voyage
dans
la
haute
pensylvanie
sic
et
dans
de
new
york
and
in
adding
to
his
paper
on
potato
culture
footnote
traite
de
la
culture
des
pommes
de
terre
a
second
on
the
false
acacia
but
his
best
work
was
done
and
he
knew
it
crevecoeur
lived
on
until
dying
in
the
same
year
with
madame
who
was
so
much
his
elder
he
paid
a
worthy
tribute
to
that
lady
character
perhaps
we
do
her
an
injustice
in
knowing
her
only
for
the
liaison
with
he
died
on
november
member
of
agricultural
societies
and
of
the
academy
section
of
moral
and
political
science
and
of
philosophical
society
at
philadelphia
a
town
in
vermont
had
been
named
johnsbury
in
his
honour
he
had
the
freedom
of
more
than
one
new
england
city
it
is
none
the
less
as
the
author
of
letters
from
an
american
farmer
published
in
and
written
for
the
most
part
years
before
that
date
that
we
remember
him
so
far
as
we
do
remember
iv
much
remains
unsaid
much
even
of
the
essential
some
of
the
facts
are
still
unknown
others
may
be
looked
for
in
the
biography
written
by
his
robert
de
crevecoeur
and
published
at
paris
some
eighty
years
ago
there
is
hardly
occasion
to
discuss
here
what
crevecoeur
did
as
consul
at
new
york
to
encourage
the
exchange
of
french
manufactures
and
american
exports
or
to
tell
of
his
line
the
first
established
between
new
york
and
a
french
port
or
to
set
down
the
story
of
his
children
or
to
describe
those
last
sad
years
at
home
and
abroad
after
the
close
of
his
consular
career
there
is
no
room
at
all
for
the
words
of
praise
that
were
spoken
of
the
letters
by
franklin
and
washington
who
recommended
them
to
intending
immigrants
as
a
faithful
albeit
highly
coloured
picture
we
must
let
the
writings
of
the
american
farmer
speak
for
themselves
they
belong
after
all
to
literature
it
was
a
modest
man
a
modest
life
a
life
filled
none
the
less
with
romantic
incident
all
this
throws
into
relief
the
beauty
of
its
best
fruits
crevecoeur
made
no
claim
to
artistry
when
he
wrote
his
simple
heartfelt
letters
and
yet
his
style
in
spite
of
occasional
defects
and
extra
flourishes
seems
to
us
worthy
of
his
theme
these
letters
from
an
american
farmer
have
been
an
inspiration
to
poets
and
they
smell
of
the
woods
in
a
prose
age
crevecoeur
lived
a
kind
of
pastoral
poetry
in
an
age
largely
blind
he
saw
the
beauties
of
nature
less
through
readings
in
the
nouvelle
heloise
and
bernardin
etudes
than
with
his
own
keen
eyes
he
was
a
true
idealist
besides
and
as
such
kindles
one
enthusiasm
the
man
optimism
his
grateful
personality
his
saneness
too
for
here
is
a
dreamer
neither
idle
nor
morbid
are
qualities
no
less
enduring
or
endearing
than
his
fame
as
the
american
farmer
might
have
used
cotton
retirement
for
an
epigraph
on
his
farewell
thou
busy
world
and
may
we
never
meet
again
here
i
can
eat
and
sleep
and
pray
but
for
the
fact
that
he
found
time
to
turn
the
clods
withal
and
eyes
to
watch
the
earth
blackening
behind
the
plough
our
necessities
wrote
poe
who
contended
in
a
way
that
the
americans
of
his
generation
were
as
poetical
a
people
as
any
other
have
been
mistaken
for
our
propensities
having
been
forced
to
make
railroads
it
has
been
deemed
impossible
that
we
should
make
verse
but
here
was
de
crevecoeur
writing
in
the
eighteenth
century
his
idyllic
letters
while
if
he
did
not
build
railways
he
interested
himself
in
the
experiments
of
fitch
and
rumsey
and
parmentier
and
organised
a
between
new
york
and
lorient
in
brittany
this
crevecoeur
should
from
the
first
have
appealed
to
the
imagination
especially
to
the
american
as
he
did
the
faculty
of
the
ideal
and
the
achievement
of
the
actual
it
is
not
too
late
for
him
to
appeal
in
spite
of
all
his
quaintness
crevecoeur

advertisement
to
the
first
edition
the
following
letters
are
the
genuine
production
of
the
american
farmer
whose
name
they
bear
they
were
privately
written
to
gratify
the
curiosity
of
a
friend
and
are
made
public
because
they
contain
much
authentic
information
little
known
on
this
side
the
atlantic
they
can
not
therefore
fail
of
being
highly
interesting
to
the
people
of
england
at
a
time
when
everybody
attention
is
directed
toward
the
affairs
of
america
that
these
letters
are
the
actual
result
of
a
private
correspondence
may
fairly
be
inferred
exclusive
of
other
evidence
from
the
style
and
manner
in
which
they
are
conceived
for
though
plain
and
familiar
and
sometimes
animated
they
are
by
no
means
exempt
from
such
inaccuracies
as
must
unavoidably
occur
in
the
rapid
effusions
of
a
confessedly
inexperienced
writer
our
farmer
had
long
been
an
of
transactions
that
have
deformed
the
face
of
america
he
is
one
of
those
who
dreaded
and
has
severely
felt
the
desolating
consequences
of
a
rupture
between
the
parent
state
and
her
colonies
for
he
has
been
driven
from
a
situation
the
enjoyment
of
which
the
reader
will
find
pathetically
described
in
the
early
letters
of
this
volume
the
unhappy
contest
is
at
length
however
drawing
toward
a
period
and
it
is
now
only
left
us
to
hope
that
the
obvious
interests
and
mutual
wants
of
both
countries
may
in
due
time
and
in
spite
of
all
obstacles
happily
them
should
our
farmer
letters
be
found
to
afford
matter
of
useful
entertainment
to
an
intelligent
and
candid
public
a
second
volume
equally
interesting
with
those
now
published
may
soon
be
expected
advertisement
to
the
second
edition
since
the
publication
of
this
volume
we
hear
that
john
has
accepted
a
public
employment
at
new
york
it
is
therefore
perhaps
doubtful
whether
he
will
soon
be
at
leisure
to
revise
his
papers
and
give
the
world
a
second
collection
of
the
american
farmer
letters
to
the
abbe
raynal
behold
sir
an
humble
american
planter
a
simple
cultivator
of
the
earth
addressing
you
from
the
farther
side
of
the
atlantic
and
presuming
to
fix
your
name
at
the
head
of
his
trifling
lucubrations
i
wish
they
were
worthy
of
so
great
an
honour
yet
why
should
not
i
be
permitted
to
disclose
those
sentiments
which
i
have
so
often
felt
from
my
heart
a
few
years
since
i
met
accidentally
with
your
political
and
philosophical
history
and
perused
it
with
infinite
pleasure
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
reflected
on
the
relative
state
of
nations
i
traced
the
extended
ramifications
of
a
commerce
which
ought
to
unite
but
now
convulses
the
world
i
admired
that
universal
benevolence
that
diffusive
goodwill
which
is
not
confined
to
the
narrow
limits
of
your
own
country
but
on
the
contrary
extends
to
the
whole
human
race
as
an
eloquent
and
powerful
advocate
you
have
pleaded
the
cause
of
humanity
in
espousing
that
of
the
poor
africans
you
viewed
these
provinces
of
north
america
in
their
true
light
as
the
asylum
of
freedom
as
the
cradle
of
future
nations
and
the
refuge
of
distressed
europeans
why
then
should
i
refrain
from
loving
and
respecting
a
man
whose
writings
i
so
much
admire
these
two
sentiments
are
inseparable
at
least
in
my
breast
i
conceived
your
genius
to
be
present
at
the
head
of
my
study
under
its
invisible
but
powerful
guidance
i
prosecuted
my
small
labours
and
now
permit
me
to
sanctify
them
under
the
auspices
of
your
name
let
the
sincerity
of
the
motives
which
urge
me
prevent
you
from
thinking
that
this
well
meant
address
contains
aught
but
the
purest
tribute
of
reverence
and
affection
there
is
no
doubt
a
secret
communion
among
good
men
throughout
the
world
a
mental
affinity
connecting
them
by
a
similitude
of
sentiments
then
why
though
an
american
should
not
i
be
permitted
to
share
in
that
extensive
intellectual
consanguinity
yes
i
do
and
though
the
name
of
a
man
who
possesses
neither
titles
nor
places
who
never
rose
above
the
humble
rank
of
a
farmer
may
appear
insignificant
yet
as
the
sentiments
i
have
expressed
are
also
the
echo
of
those
of
my
countrymen
on
their
behalf
as
well
as
on
my
own
give
me
leave
to
subscribe
myself
sir
your
very
sincere
admirer
hector
john
carlisle
in
pennsylvania
letters
from
an
american
farmer
letter
i
introduction
who
would
have
thought
that
because
i
received
you
with
hospitality
and
kindness
you
should
imagine
me
capable
of
writing
with
propriety
and
perspicuity
your
gratitude
misleads
your
judgment
the
knowledge
which
i
acquired
from
your
conversation
has
amply
repaid
me
for
your
five
weeks
entertainment
i
gave
you
nothing
more
than
what
common
hospitality
dictated
but
could
any
other
guest
have
instructed
me
as
you
did
you
conducted
me
on
the
map
from
one
european
country
to
another
told
me
many
extraordinary
things
of
our
famed
of
which
i
knew
very
little
of
its
internal
navigation
agriculture
arts
manufactures
and
trade
you
guided
me
through
an
extensive
maze
and
i
abundantly
profited
by
the
journey
the
contrast
therefore
proves
the
debt
of
gratitude
to
be
on
my
side
the
treatment
you
received
at
my
house
proceeded
from
the
warmth
of
my
heart
and
from
the
corresponding
sensibility
of
my
wife
what
you
now
desire
must
flow
from
a
very
limited
power
of
mind
the
task
requires
recollection
and
a
variety
of
talents
which
i
do
not
possess
it
is
true
i
can
describe
our
american
modes
of
farming
our
manners
and
peculiar
customs
with
some
degree
of
propriety
because
i
have
ever
attentively
studied
them
but
my
knowledge
extends
no
farther
and
is
this
local
and
unadorned
information
sufficient
to
answer
all
your
expectations
and
to
satisfy
your
curiosity
i
am
surprised
that
in
the
course
of
your
american
travels
you
should
not
have
found
out
persons
more
enlightened
and
better
educated
than
i
am
your
predilection
excites
my
wonder
much
more
than
my
vanity
my
share
of
the
latter
being
confined
merely
to
the
neatness
of
my
rural
operations
my
father
left
me
a
few
musty
books
which
his
father
brought
from
england
with
him
but
what
help
can
i
draw
from
a
library
consisting
mostly
of
scotch
divinity
the
navigation
of
sir
francis
drake
the
history
of
queen
elizabeth
and
a
few
miscellaneous
volumes
our
minister
often
comes
to
see
me
though
he
lives
upwards
of
twenty
miles
distant
i
have
shown
him
your
letter
asked
his
advice
and
solicited
his
assistance
he
tells
me
that
he
hath
no
time
to
spare
for
that
like
the
rest
of
us
must
till
his
farm
and
is
moreover
to
study
what
he
is
to
say
on
the
sabbath
my
wife
and
i
never
do
anything
without
consulting
her
laughs
and
tells
me
that
you
can
not
be
in
earnest
what
says
she
james
wouldst
thee
pretend
to
send
epistles
to
a
great
european
man
who
hath
lived
abundance
of
time
in
that
big
house
called
cambridge
where
they
say
that
worldly
learning
is
so
abundant
that
people
gets
it
only
by
breathing
the
air
of
the
place
wouldst
not
thee
be
ashamed
to
write
unto
a
man
who
has
never
in
his
life
done
a
single
day
work
no
not
even
felled
a
tree
who
hath
expended
the
lord
knows
how
many
years
in
studying
stars
geometry
stones
and
flies
and
in
reading
folio
books
who
hath
travelled
as
he
told
us
to
the
city
of
rome
itself
only
think
of
a
london
man
going
to
rome
where
is
it
that
these
english
folks
wo
go
one
who
hath
seen
the
factory
of
brimstone
at
suvius
and
town
of
pompey
under
ground
wouldst
thou
pretend
to
letter
it
with
a
person
who
hath
been
to
paris
to
the
alps
to
petersburg
and
who
hath
seen
so
many
fine
things
up
and
down
the
old
countries
who
hath
come
over
the
great
sea
unto
us
and
hath
journeyed
from
our
new
hampshire
in
the
east
to
our
charles
town
in
the
south
who
hath
visited
all
our
great
cities
knows
most
of
our
famous
lawyers
and
cunning
folks
who
hath
conversed
with
very
many
king
men
governors
and
counsellors
and
yet
pitches
upon
thee
for
his
correspondent
as
thee
calls
it
surely
he
means
to
jeer
thee
i
am
sure
he
does
he
can
not
be
in
a
real
fair
earnest
james
thee
must
read
this
letter
over
again
paragraph
by
paragraph
and
warily
observe
whether
thee
perceive
some
words
of
jesting
something
that
hath
more
than
one
meaning
and
now
i
think
on
it
husband
i
wish
thee
wouldst
let
me
see
his
letter
though
i
am
but
a
woman
as
thee
mayest
say
yet
i
understand
the
purport
of
words
in
good
measure
for
when
i
was
a
girl
father
sent
us
to
the
very
best
master
in
the
she
then
read
it
herself
very
attentively
our
minister
was
present
we
listened
to
and
weighed
every
syllable
we
all
unanimously
concluded
that
you
must
have
been
in
a
sober
earnest
intention
as
my
wife
calls
it
and
your
request
appeared
to
be
candid
and
sincere
then
again
on
recollecting
the
difference
between
your
sphere
of
life
and
mine
a
new
fit
of
astonishment
seized
us
all
our
minister
took
the
letter
from
my
wife
and
read
it
to
himself
he
made
us
observe
the
two
last
phrases
and
we
weighed
the
contents
to
the
best
of
our
abilities
the
conclusion
we
all
drew
made
me
resolve
at
last
to
you
say
you
want
nothing
of
me
but
what
lies
within
the
reach
of
my
experience
and
knowledge
this
i
understand
very
well
the
difficulty
is
how
to
collect
digest
and
arrange
what
i
know
next
you
assert
that
writing
letters
is
nothing
more
than
talking
on
paper
which
i
must
confess
appeared
to
me
quite
a
new
well
then
observed
our
minister
neighbour
james
as
you
can
talk
well
i
am
sure
you
must
write
tolerably
well
also
imagine
then
that
is
still
here
and
simply
write
down
what
you
would
say
to
him
suppose
the
questions
be
will
put
to
you
in
his
future
letters
to
be
asked
by
his
viva
voce
as
we
used
to
call
it
at
the
college
then
let
your
answers
be
conceived
and
expressed
exactly
in
the
same
language
as
if
he
was
present
this
is
all
that
he
requires
from
you
and
i
am
sure
the
task
is
not
difficult
he
is
your
friend
who
would
be
ashamed
to
write
to
such
a
person
although
he
is
a
man
of
learning
and
taste
yet
i
am
sure
he
will
read
your
letters
with
pleasure
if
they
be
not
elegant
they
will
smell
of
the
woods
and
be
a
little
wild
i
know
your
turn
they
will
contain
some
matters
which
he
never
knew
before
some
people
are
so
fond
of
novelty
that
they
will
overlook
many
errors
of
language
for
the
sake
of
information
we
are
all
apt
to
love
and
admire
exotics
tho
they
may
be
often
inferior
to
what
we
possess
and
that
is
the
reason
i
imagine
why
so
many
persons
are
continually
going
to
visit
that
country
is
the
daily
resort
of
modern
travellers
james
i
should
like
to
know
what
is
there
to
be
seen
so
goodly
and
profitable
that
so
many
should
wish
to
visit
no
other
country
minister
i
do
not
very
well
know
i
fancy
their
object
is
to
trace
the
vestiges
of
a
once
flourishing
people
now
extinct
there
they
amuse
themselves
in
viewing
the
ruins
of
temples
and
other
buildings
which
have
very
little
affinity
with
those
of
the
present
age
and
must
therefore
impart
a
knowledge
which
appears
useless
and
trifling
i
have
often
wondered
that
no
skilful
botanists
or
learned
men
should
come
over
here
methinks
there
would
be
much
more
real
satisfaction
in
observing
among
us
the
humble
rudiments
and
embryos
of
societies
spreading
everywhere
the
recent
foundation
of
our
towns
and
the
settlements
of
so
many
rural
districts
i
am
sure
that
the
rapidity
of
their
growth
would
be
more
pleasing
to
behold
than
the
ruins
of
old
towers
useless
aqueducts
or
impending
battlements
james
what
you
say
minister
seems
very
true
do
go
on
i
always
love
to
hear
you
talk
minister
do
you
think
neighbour
james
that
the
mind
of
a
good
and
enlightened
englishman
would
be
more
improved
in
remarking
throughout
these
provinces
the
causes
which
render
so
many
people
happy
in
delineating
the
unnoticed
means
by
which
we
daily
increase
the
extent
of
our
settlements
how
we
convert
huge
forests
into
pleasing
fields
and
exhibit
through
these
thirteen
provinces
so
singular
a
display
of
easy
subsistence
and
political
felicity
in
italy
all
the
objects
of
contemplation
all
the
reveries
of
the
traveller
must
have
a
reference
to
ancient
generations
and
to
very
distant
periods
clouded
with
the
mist
of
here
on
the
contrary
everything
is
modern
peaceful
and
benign
here
we
have
had
no
war
to
desolate
our
fields
footnote
the
troubles
that
now
convulse
the
american
colonies
had
not
broke
out
when
this
and
some
of
the
following
letters
were
written
our
religion
does
not
oppress
the
cultivators
we
are
strangers
to
those
feudal
institutions
which
have
enslaved
so
many
here
nature
opens
her
broad
lap
to
receive
the
perpetual
accession
of
new
comers
and
to
supply
them
with
food
i
am
sure
i
can
not
be
called
a
partial
american
when
i
say
that
the
spectacle
afforded
by
these
pleasing
scenes
must
be
more
entertaining
and
more
philosophical
than
that
which
arises
from
beholding
the
musty
ruins
of
rome
here
everything
would
inspire
the
reflecting
traveller
with
the
most
philanthropic
ideas
his
imagination
instead
of
submitting
to
the
painful
and
useless
retrospect
of
revolutions
desolations
and
plagues
would
on
the
contrary
wisely
spring
forward
to
the
anticipated
fields
of
future
cultivation
and
improvement
to
the
future
extent
of
those
generations
which
are
to
replenish
and
embellish
this
boundless
continent
there
the
amphitheatres
and
the
putrid
fevers
of
the
campania
must
fill
the
mind
with
the
most
melancholy
reflections
whilst
he
is
seeking
for
the
origin
and
the
intention
of
those
structures
with
which
he
is
surrounded
and
for
the
cause
of
so
great
a
decay
here
he
might
contemplate
the
very
beginnings
and
outlines
of
human
society
which
can
be
traced
nowhere
now
but
in
this
part
of
the
world
the
rest
of
the
earth
i
am
told
is
in
some
places
too
full
in
others
half
depopulated
misguided
religion
tyranny
and
absurd
laws
everywhere
depress
and
afflict
mankind
here
we
have
in
some
measure
regained
the
ancient
dignity
of
our
species
our
laws
are
simple
and
just
we
are
a
race
of
cultivators
our
cultivation
is
unrestrained
and
therefore
everything
is
prosperous
and
flourishing
for
my
part
i
had
rather
admire
the
ample
barn
of
one
of
our
opulent
farmers
who
himself
felled
the
first
tree
in
his
plantation
and
was
the
first
founder
of
his
settlement
than
study
the
dimensions
of
the
temple
of
ceres
i
had
rather
record
the
progressive
steps
of
this
industrious
farmer
throughout
all
the
stages
of
his
labours
and
other
operations
than
examine
how
modern
italian
convents
can
be
supported
without
doing
anything
but
singing
and
praying
however
confined
the
field
of
speculation
might
be
here
the
time
of
english
travellers
would
not
be
wholly
lost
the
new
and
unexpected
aspect
of
our
extensive
settlements
of
our
fine
rivers
that
great
field
of
action
everywhere
visible
that
ease
that
peace
with
which
so
many
people
live
together
would
greatly
interest
the
observer
for
whatever
difficulties
there
might
happen
in
the
object
of
their
researches
that
hospitality
which
prevails
from
one
end
of
the
continent
to
the
other
would
in
all
parts
facilitate
their
excursions
as
it
is
from
the
surface
of
the
ground
which
we
till
that
we
have
gathered
the
wealth
we
possess
the
surface
of
that
ground
is
therefore
the
only
thing
that
has
hitherto
been
known
it
will
require
the
industry
of
subsequent
ages
the
energy
of
future
generations
ere
mankind
here
will
have
leisure
and
abilities
to
penetrate
deep
and
in
the
bowels
of
this
continent
search
for
the
subterranean
riches
it
no
doubt
neighbour
james
we
want
much
the
assistance
of
men
of
leisure
and
knowledge
we
want
eminent
chemists
to
inform
our
iron
masters
to
teach
us
how
to
make
and
prepare
most
of
the
colours
we
use
here
we
have
none
equal
to
this
task
if
any
useful
discoveries
are
therefore
made
among
us
they
are
the
effects
of
chance
or
else
arise
from
that
restless
industry
which
is
the
principal
characteristic
of
these
colonies
james
oh
could
i
express
myself
as
you
do
my
friend
i
should
not
balance
a
single
instant
i
should
rather
be
anxious
to
commence
a
correspondence
which
would
do
me
credit
minister
you
can
write
full
as
well
as
you
need
and
will
improve
very
fast
trust
to
my
prophecy
your
letters
at
least
will
have
the
merit
of
coming
from
the
edge
of
the
great
wilderness
three
hundred
miles
from
the
sea
and
three
thousand
miles
over
that
sea
this
will
be
no
detriment
to
them
take
my
word
for
it
you
intend
one
of
your
children
for
the
gown
who
knows
but
may
give
you
some
assistance
when
the
lad
comes
to
have
concerns
with
the
bishop
it
is
good
for
american
farmers
to
have
friends
even
in
england
what
he
requires
of
you
is
but
simple
what
we
speak
out
among
ourselves
we
call
conversation
and
a
letter
is
only
conversation
put
down
in
black
and
white
james
you
quite
persuade
me
if
he
laughs
at
my
awkwardness
surely
he
will
be
pleased
with
my
ready
compliance
on
my
part
it
will
be
well
meant
let
the
execution
be
what
it
may
i
will
write
enough
and
so
let
him
have
the
trouble
of
sifting
the
good
from
the
bad
the
useful
from
the
trifling
let
him
select
what
he
may
want
and
reject
what
may
not
answer
his
purpose
after
all
it
is
but
treating
now
that
he
is
in
london
as
i
treated
him
when
he
was
in
america
under
this
roof
that
is
with
the
best
things
i
had
given
with
a
good
intention
and
the
best
manner
i
was
able
very
different
james
very
different
indeed
said
my
wife
i
like
not
thy
comparison
our
small
house
and
cellar
our
orchard
and
garden
afforded
what
he
wanted
one
half
of
his
time
poor
man
lived
upon
nothing
but
or
peaches
and
milk
now
these
things
were
such
as
god
had
given
us
myself
and
wench
did
the
rest
we
were
not
the
creators
of
these
victuals
we
only
cooked
them
as
well
and
as
neat
as
we
could
the
first
thing
james
is
to
know
what
sort
of
materials
thee
hast
within
thy
own
self
and
then
whether
thee
canst
dish
them
well
well
wife
thee
art
wrong
for
once
if
i
was
filled
with
worldly
vanity
thy
rebuke
would
be
timely
but
thee
knowest
that
i
have
but
little
of
that
how
shall
i
know
what
i
am
capable
of
till
i
try
hadst
thee
never
employed
thyself
in
thy
father
house
to
learn
and
to
practise
the
many
branches
of
that
thy
parents
were
famous
for
thee
wouldst
have
made
but
a
sorry
wife
for
an
american
farmer
thee
never
shouldst
have
been
mine
i
married
thee
not
for
what
thee
hadst
but
for
what
thee
knewest
doest
not
thee
observe
what
says
beside
he
tells
me
that
the
art
of
writing
is
just
like
unto
every
other
art
of
man
that
it
is
acquired
by
habit
and
by
perseverance
that
is
singularly
true
said
our
minister
he
that
shall
write
a
letter
every
day
of
the
week
will
on
saturday
perceive
the
sixth
flowing
from
his
pen
much
more
readily
than
the
first
i
observed
when
i
first
entered
into
the
ministry
and
began
to
preach
the
word
i
felt
perplexed
and
dry
my
mind
was
like
unto
a
parched
soil
which
produced
nothing
not
even
weeds
by
the
blessing
of
heaven
and
my
perseverance
in
study
i
grew
richer
in
thoughts
phrases
and
words
i
felt
copious
and
now
i
can
abundantly
preach
from
any
text
that
occurs
to
my
mind
so
will
it
be
with
you
neighbour
james
begin
therefore
without
delay
and
f
b
letters
may
be
of
great
service
to
you
he
will
no
doubt
inform
you
of
many
things
correspondence
consists
in
reciprocal
letters
leave
off
your
diffidence
and
i
will
do
my
best
to
help
you
whenever
i
have
any
leisure
well
then
i
am
resolved
i
said
to
follow
your
counsel
my
letters
shall
not
be
sent
nor
will
i
receive
any
without
reading
them
to
you
and
my
wife
women
are
curious
they
love
to
know
their
husband
secrets
it
will
not
be
the
first
thing
which
i
have
submitted
to
your
joint
opinions
whenever
you
come
to
dine
with
us
these
shall
be
the
last
dish
on
the
table
nor
will
they
be
the
most
unpalatable
answered
the
good
man
nature
hath
given
you
a
tolerable
share
of
sense
and
that
is
one
of
her
best
gifts
let
me
tell
you
she
has
given
you
besides
some
perspicuity
which
qualifies
you
to
distinguish
interesting
objects
a
warmth
of
imagination
which
enables
you
to
think
with
quickness
you
often
extract
useful
reflections
from
objects
which
presented
none
to
my
mind
you
have
a
tender
and
a
well
meaning
heart
you
love
description
and
your
pencil
assure
yourself
is
not
a
bad
one
for
the
pencil
of
a
farmer
it
seems
to
be
held
without
any
labour
your
mind
is
what
we
called
at
yale
college
a
tabula
rasa
where
spontaneous
and
strong
impressions
are
delineated
with
facility
ah
neighbour
had
you
received
but
half
the
education
of
you
had
been
a
worthy
correspondent
indeed
but
perhaps
you
will
be
a
more
entertaining
one
dressed
in
your
simple
american
garb
than
if
you
were
clad
in
all
the
gowns
of
cambridge
you
will
appear
to
him
something
like
one
of
our
wild
american
plants
irregularly
luxuriant
in
its
various
branches
which
an
european
scholar
may
probably
think
ill
placed
and
useless
if
our
soil
is
not
remarkable
as
yet
for
the
excellence
of
its
fruits
this
exuberance
is
however
a
strong
proof
of
fertility
which
wants
nothing
but
the
progressive
knowledge
acquired
by
time
to
amend
and
to
correct
it
is
easier
to
retrench
than
it
is
to
add
i
do
not
mean
to
flatter
you
neighbour
james
adulation
would
ill
become
my
character
you
may
therefore
believe
what
your
pastor
says
were
i
in
europe
i
should
be
tired
with
perpetually
seeing
espaliers
plashed
hedges
and
trees
dwarfed
into
pigmies
do
let
see
on
paper
a
few
american
wild
cherry
trees
such
as
nature
forms
them
here
in
all
her
unconfined
vigour
in
all
the
amplitude
of
their
extended
limbs
and
spreading
ramifications
let
him
see
that
we
are
possessed
with
strong
vegetative
embryos
after
all
why
should
not
a
farmer
be
allowed
to
make
use
of
his
mental
faculties
as
well
as
others
because
a
man
works
is
not
he
to
think
and
if
he
thinks
usefully
why
should
not
he
in
his
leisure
hours
set
down
his
thoughts
i
have
composed
many
a
good
sermon
as
i
followed
my
plough
the
eyes
not
being
then
engaged
on
any
particular
object
leaves
the
mind
free
for
the
introduction
of
many
useful
ideas
it
is
not
in
the
noisy
shop
of
a
blacksmith
or
of
a
carpenter
that
these
studious
moments
can
be
enjoyed
it
is
as
we
silently
till
the
ground
and
muse
along
the
odoriferous
furrows
of
our
low
lands
uninterrupted
either
by
stones
or
stumps
it
is
there
that
the
salubrious
effluvia
of
the
earth
animate
our
spirits
and
serve
to
inspire
us
every
other
avocation
of
our
farms
are
severe
labours
compared
to
this
pleasing
occupation
of
all
the
tasks
which
mine
imposes
on
me
ploughing
is
the
most
agreeable
because
i
can
think
as
i
work
my
mind
is
at
leisure
my
labour
flows
from
instinct
as
well
as
that
of
my
horses
there
is
no
kind
of
difference
between
us
in
our
different
shares
of
that
operation
one
of
them
keeps
the
furrow
the
other
avoids
it
at
the
end
of
my
field
they
turn
either
to
the
right
or
left
as
they
are
bid
whilst
i
thoughtlessly
hold
and
guide
the
plough
to
which
they
are
harnessed
do
therefore
neighbour
begin
this
correspondence
and
persevere
difficulties
will
vanish
in
proportion
as
you
draw
near
them
you
be
surprised
at
yourself
by
and
by
when
you
come
to
look
back
you
say
as
i
have
often
said
to
myself
had
i
been
diffident
i
had
never
proceeded
thus
far
would
you
painfully
till
your
stony
and
neglect
the
fine
rich
bottom
which
lies
before
your
door
had
you
never
tried
you
never
had
learned
how
to
mend
and
make
your
ploughs
it
will
be
no
small
pleasure
to
your
children
to
tell
hereafter
that
their
father
was
not
only
one
of
the
most
industrious
farmers
in
the
country
but
one
of
the
best
writers
when
you
have
once
begun
do
as
when
you
begin
breaking
up
your
summer
fallow
you
never
consider
what
remains
to
be
done
you
view
only
what
you
have
ploughed
therefore
neighbour
james
take
my
advice
it
will
go
well
with
you
i
am
sure
it
and
do
you
really
think
so
sir
your
counsel
which
i
have
long
followed
weighs
much
with
me
i
verily
believe
that
i
must
write
to
by
the
first
if
thee
persistest
in
being
such
a
foolhardy
man
said
my
wife
for
god
sake
let
it
be
kept
a
profound
secret
among
us
if
it
were
once
known
abroad
that
thee
writest
to
a
great
and
rich
man
over
at
london
there
would
be
no
end
of
the
talk
of
the
people
some
would
vow
that
thee
art
going
to
turn
an
author
others
would
pretend
to
foresee
some
great
alterations
in
the
welfare
of
thy
family
some
would
say
this
some
would
say
that
who
would
wish
to
become
the
subject
of
public
talk
weigh
this
matter
well
before
thee
beginnest
james
consider
that
a
great
deal
of
thy
time
and
of
thy
reputation
is
at
stake
as
i
may
say
wert
thee
to
write
as
well
as
friend
edmund
whose
speeches
i
often
see
in
our
papers
it
would
be
the
very
self
same
thing
thee
wouldst
be
equally
accused
of
idleness
and
vain
notions
not
befitting
thy
condition
our
colonel
would
be
often
coming
here
to
know
what
it
is
that
thee
canst
write
so
much
about
some
would
imagine
that
thee
wantest
to
become
either
an
or
a
magistrate
which
god
forbid
and
that
thee
art
telling
the
king
men
abundance
of
things
instead
of
being
well
looked
upon
as
now
and
living
in
peace
with
all
the
world
our
neighbours
would
be
making
strange
surmises
i
had
rather
be
as
we
are
neither
better
nor
worse
than
the
rest
of
our
country
folks
thee
knowest
what
i
mean
though
i
should
be
sorry
to
deprive
thee
of
any
honest
recreation
therefore
as
i
have
said
before
let
it
be
as
great
a
secret
as
if
it
was
some
heinous
crime
the
minister
i
am
sure
will
not
divulge
it
as
for
my
part
though
i
am
a
woman
yet
i
know
what
it
is
to
be
a
i
would
not
have
thee
james
pass
for
what
the
world
calleth
a
writer
no
not
for
a
peck
of
gold
as
the
saying
is
thy
father
before
thee
was
a
plain
dealing
honest
man
punctual
in
all
things
he
was
one
of
yea
and
nay
of
few
words
all
he
minded
was
his
farm
and
his
work
i
wonder
from
whence
thee
hast
got
this
love
of
the
pen
had
he
spent
his
time
in
sending
epistles
to
and
fro
he
never
would
have
left
thee
this
goodly
plantation
free
from
debt
all
i
say
is
in
good
meaning
great
people
over
sea
may
write
to
our
town
folks
because
they
have
nothing
else
to
do
these
englishmen
are
strange
people
because
they
can
live
upon
what
they
call
bank
notes
without
working
they
think
that
all
the
world
can
do
the
same
this
goodly
country
never
would
have
been
tilled
and
cleared
with
these
notes
i
am
sure
when
was
here
he
saw
thee
sweat
and
take
abundance
of
pains
he
often
told
me
how
the
americans
worked
a
great
deal
harder
than
the
home
englishmen
for
there
he
told
us
that
they
have
no
trees
to
cut
down
no
fences
to
make
no
negroes
to
buy
and
to
clothe
and
now
i
think
on
it
when
wilt
thee
send
him
those
trees
he
bespoke
but
if
they
have
no
trees
to
cut
down
they
have
gold
in
abundance
they
say
for
they
rake
it
and
scrape
it
from
all
parts
far
and
near
i
have
often
heard
my
grandfather
tell
how
they
live
there
by
writing
by
writing
they
send
this
cargo
unto
us
that
to
the
west
and
the
other
to
the
east
indies
but
james
thee
knowest
that
it
is
not
by
writing
that
we
shall
pay
the
blacksmith
the
minister
the
weaver
the
tailor
and
the
english
shop
but
as
thee
art
an
early
man
follow
thine
own
inclinations
thee
wantest
some
rest
i
am
sure
and
why
shouldst
thee
not
employ
it
as
it
may
seem
meet
unto
however
let
it
be
a
great
secret
how
wouldst
thee
bear
to
be
called
at
our
country
meetings
the
man
of
the
pen
if
this
scheme
of
thine
was
once
known
travellers
as
they
go
along
would
point
out
to
our
house
saying
here
liveth
the
scribbling
fanner
better
hear
them
as
usual
observe
here
liveth
the
warm
substantial
family
that
never
begrudgeth
a
meal
of
victuals
or
a
mess
of
oats
to
any
one
that
steps
in
look
how
fat
and
well
clad
their
negroes
are
thus
sir
have
i
given
you
an
unaffected
and
candid
detail
of
the
conversation
which
determined
me
to
accept
of
your
invitation
i
thought
it
necessary
thus
to
begin
and
to
let
you
into
these
primary
secrets
to
the
end
that
you
may
not
hereafter
reproach
me
with
any
degree
of
presumption
you
plainly
see
the
motives
which
have
induced
me
to
begin
the
fears
which
i
have
entertained
and
the
principles
on
which
my
diffidence
hath
been
founded
i
have
now
nothing
to
do
but
to
prosecute
my
task
remember
you
are
to
give
me
my
subjects
and
on
no
other
shall
i
write
lest
you
should
blame
me
for
an
injudicious
choice
however
incorrect
my
style
however
unexpert
my
methods
however
trifling
my
observations
may
hereafter
appear
to
you
assure
yourself
they
will
all
be
the
genuine
dictates
of
my
mind
and
i
hope
will
prove
acceptable
on
that
account
remember
that
you
have
laid
the
foundation
of
this
correspondence
you
well
know
that
i
am
neither
a
philosopher
politician
divine
nor
naturalist
but
a
simple
farmer
i
flatter
myself
therefore
that
you
receive
my
letters
as
conceived
not
according
to
scientific
rules
to
which
i
am
a
perfect
stranger
but
agreeable
to
the
spontaneous
impressions
which
each
subject
may
inspire
this
is
the
only
line
i
am
able
to
follow
the
line
which
nature
has
herself
traced
for
me
this
was
the
covenant
which
i
made
with
you
and
with
which
you
seemed
to
be
well
pleased
had
you
wanted
the
style
of
the
learned
the
reflections
of
the
patriot
the
discussions
of
the
politician
the
curious
observations
of
the
naturalist
the
pleasing
garb
of
the
man
of
taste
surely
you
would
have
applied
to
some
of
those
men
of
letters
with
which
our
cities
abound
but
since
on
the
contrary
and
for
what
reason
i
know
not
you
wish
to
correspond
with
a
cultivator
of
the
earth
with
a
simple
citizen
you
must
receive
my
letters
for
better
or
worse
letter
ii
on
the
situation
feelings
and
pleasures
of
an
american
farmer
as
you
are
the
first
enlightened
european
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
being
acquainted
with
you
will
not
be
surprised
that
i
should
according
to
your
earnest
desire
and
my
promise
appear
anxious
of
preserving
your
friendship
and
correspondence
by
your
accounts
i
observe
a
material
difference
subsists
between
your
husbandry
modes
and
customs
and
ours
everything
is
local
could
we
enjoy
the
advantages
of
the
english
farmer
we
should
be
much
happier
indeed
but
this
wish
like
many
others
implies
a
contradiction
and
could
the
english
farmer
have
some
of
those
privileges
we
possess
they
would
be
the
first
of
their
class
in
the
world
good
and
evil
i
see
is
to
be
found
in
all
societies
and
it
is
in
vain
to
seek
for
any
spot
where
those
ingredients
are
not
mixed
i
therefore
rest
satisfied
and
thank
god
that
my
lot
is
to
be
an
american
farmer
instead
of
a
russian
boor
or
an
hungarian
peasant
i
thank
you
kindly
for
the
idea
however
dreadful
which
you
have
given
me
of
their
lot
and
condition
your
observations
have
confirmed
me
in
the
justness
of
my
ideas
and
i
am
happier
now
than
i
thought
myself
before
it
is
strange
that
misery
when
viewed
in
others
should
become
to
us
a
sort
of
real
good
though
i
am
far
from
rejoicing
to
hear
that
there
are
in
the
world
men
so
thoroughly
wretched
they
are
no
doubt
as
harmless
industrious
and
willing
to
work
as
we
are
hard
is
their
fate
to
be
thus
condemned
to
a
slavery
worse
than
that
of
our
negroes
yet
when
young
i
entertained
some
thoughts
of
selling
my
farm
i
thought
it
afforded
but
a
dull
repetition
of
the
same
labours
and
pleasures
i
thought
the
former
tedious
and
heavy
the
latter
few
and
insipid
but
when
i
came
to
consider
myself
as
divested
of
my
farm
i
then
found
the
world
so
wide
and
every
place
so
full
that
i
began
to
fear
lest
there
would
be
no
room
for
me
my
farm
my
house
my
barn
presented
to
my
imagination
objects
from
which
i
adduced
quite
new
ideas
they
were
more
forcible
than
before
why
should
not
i
find
myself
happy
said
i
where
my
father
was
before
he
left
me
no
good
books
it
is
true
he
gave
me
no
other
education
than
the
art
of
reading
and
writing
but
he
left
me
a
good
farm
and
his
experience
he
left
me
free
from
debts
and
no
kind
of
difficulties
to
struggle
i
married
and
this
perfectly
reconciled
me
to
my
situation
my
wife
rendered
my
house
all
at
once
cheerful
and
pleasing
it
no
longer
appeared
gloomy
and
solitary
as
before
when
i
went
to
work
in
my
fields
i
worked
with
more
alacrity
and
sprightliness
i
felt
that
i
did
not
work
for
myself
alone
and
this
encouraged
me
much
my
wife
would
often
come
with
her
knitting
in
her
hand
and
sit
under
the
shady
trees
praising
the
straightness
of
my
furrows
and
the
docility
of
my
horses
this
swelled
my
heart
and
made
everything
light
and
pleasant
and
i
regretted
that
i
had
not
married
before
i
felt
myself
happy
in
my
new
situation
and
where
is
that
station
which
can
confer
a
more
substantial
system
of
felicity
than
that
of
an
american
farmer
possessing
freedom
of
action
freedom
of
thoughts
ruled
by
a
mode
of
government
which
requires
but
little
from
us
i
owe
nothing
but
a
pepper
corn
to
my
country
a
small
tribute
to
my
king
with
loyalty
and
due
respect
i
know
no
other
landlord
than
the
lord
of
all
land
to
whom
i
owe
the
most
sincere
gratitude
my
father
left
me
three
hundred
and
acres
of
land
of
which
are
good
timothy
meadow
an
excellent
orchard
a
good
house
and
a
substantial
barn
it
is
my
duty
to
think
how
happy
i
am
that
he
lived
to
build
and
to
pay
for
all
these
improvements
what
are
the
labours
which
i
have
to
undergo
what
are
my
fatigues
when
compared
to
his
who
had
everything
to
do
from
the
first
tree
he
felled
to
the
finishing
of
his
house
every
year
i
kill
from
to
weight
of
pork
of
beef
half
a
dozen
of
good
wethers
in
harvest
of
fowls
my
wife
has
always
a
great
stock
what
can
i
wish
more
my
negroes
are
tolerably
faithful
and
healthy
by
a
long
series
of
industry
and
honest
dealings
my
father
left
behind
him
the
name
of
a
good
man
i
have
but
to
tread
his
paths
to
be
happy
and
a
good
man
like
him
i
know
enough
of
the
law
to
regulate
my
little
concerns
with
propriety
nor
do
i
dread
its
power
these
are
the
grand
outlines
of
my
situation
but
as
i
can
feel
much
more
than
i
am
able
to
express
i
hardly
know
how
to
proceed
when
my
first
son
was
born
the
whole
train
of
my
ideas
were
suddenly
altered
never
was
there
a
charm
that
acted
so
quickly
and
powerfully
i
ceased
to
ramble
in
imagination
through
the
wide
world
my
excursions
since
have
not
exceeded
the
bounds
of
my
farm
and
all
my
principal
pleasures
are
now
centred
within
its
scanty
limits
but
at
the
same
time
there
is
not
an
operation
belonging
to
it
in
which
i
do
not
find
some
food
for
useful
reflections
this
is
the
reason
i
suppose
that
when
you
was
here
you
used
in
your
refined
style
to
denominate
me
the
farmer
of
feelings
how
rude
must
those
feelings
be
in
him
who
daily
holds
the
axe
or
the
plough
how
much
more
refined
on
the
contrary
those
of
the
european
whose
mind
is
improved
by
education
example
books
and
by
every
acquired
advantage
those
feelings
however
i
will
delineate
as
well
as
i
can
agreeably
to
your
earnest
request
when
i
contemplate
my
wife
by
my
while
she
either
spins
knits
darns
or
suckles
our
child
i
can
not
describe
the
various
emotions
of
love
of
gratitude
of
conscious
pride
which
thrill
in
my
heart
and
often
overflow
in
involuntary
tears
i
feel
the
necessity
the
sweet
pleasure
of
acting
my
part
the
part
of
an
husband
and
father
with
an
attention
and
propriety
which
may
entitle
me
to
my
good
fortune
it
is
true
these
pleasing
images
vanish
with
the
smoke
of
my
pipe
but
though
they
disappear
from
my
mind
the
impression
they
have
made
on
my
heart
is
indelible
when
i
play
with
the
infant
my
warm
imagination
runs
forward
and
eagerly
anticipates
his
future
temper
and
constitution
i
would
willingly
open
the
book
of
fate
and
know
in
which
page
his
destiny
is
delineated
alas
where
is
the
father
who
in
those
moments
of
paternal
ecstasy
can
delineate
one
half
of
the
thoughts
which
dilate
his
heart
i
am
sure
i
can
not
then
again
i
fear
for
the
health
of
those
who
are
become
so
dear
to
me
and
in
their
sicknesses
i
severely
pay
for
the
joys
i
experienced
while
they
were
well
whenever
i
go
abroad
it
is
always
involuntary
i
never
return
home
without
feeling
some
pleasing
emotion
which
i
often
suppress
as
useless
and
foolish
the
instant
i
enter
on
my
own
land
the
bright
idea
of
property
of
exclusive
right
of
independence
exalt
my
mind
precious
soil
i
say
to
myself
by
what
singular
custom
of
law
is
it
that
thou
wast
made
to
constitute
the
riches
of
the
freeholder
what
should
we
american
farmers
be
without
the
distinct
possession
of
that
soil
it
feeds
it
clothes
us
from
it
we
draw
even
a
great
exuberancy
our
best
meat
our
richest
drink
the
very
honey
of
our
bees
comes
from
this
privileged
spot
no
wonder
we
should
thus
cherish
its
possession
no
wonder
that
so
many
europeans
who
have
never
been
able
to
say
that
such
portion
of
land
was
theirs
cross
the
atlantic
to
realise
that
happiness
this
formerly
rude
soil
has
been
converted
by
my
father
into
a
pleasant
farm
and
in
return
it
has
established
all
our
rights
on
it
is
founded
our
rank
our
freedom
our
power
as
citizens
our
importance
as
inhabitants
of
such
a
district
these
images
i
must
confess
i
always
behold
with
pleasure
and
extend
them
as
far
as
my
imagination
can
reach
for
this
is
what
may
be
called
the
true
and
the
only
philosophy
of
an
american
farmer
pray
do
not
laugh
in
thus
seeing
an
artless
countryman
tracing
himself
through
the
simple
modifications
of
his
life
remember
that
you
have
required
it
therefore
with
candour
though
with
diffidence
i
endeavour
to
follow
the
thread
of
my
feelings
but
i
can
not
tell
you
all
often
when
i
plough
my
low
ground
i
place
my
little
boy
on
a
chair
which
screws
to
the
beam
of
the
plough
its
motion
and
that
of
the
horses
please
him
he
is
perfectly
happy
and
begins
to
chat
as
i
lean
over
the
handle
various
are
the
thoughts
which
crowd
into
my
mind
i
am
now
doing
for
him
i
say
what
my
father
formerly
did
for
me
may
god
enable
him
to
live
that
he
may
perform
the
same
operations
for
the
same
purposes
when
i
am
worn
out
and
old
i
relieve
his
mother
of
some
trouble
while
i
have
him
with
me
the
odoriferous
furrow
exhilarates
his
spirits
and
seems
to
do
the
child
a
great
deal
of
good
for
he
looks
more
blooming
since
i
have
adopted
that
practice
can
more
pleasure
more
dignity
be
added
to
that
primary
occupation
the
father
thus
ploughing
with
his
child
and
to
feed
his
family
is
inferior
only
to
the
emperor
of
china
ploughing
as
an
example
to
his
kingdom
in
the
evening
when
i
return
home
through
my
low
grounds
i
am
astonished
at
the
myriads
of
insects
which
i
perceive
dancing
in
the
beams
of
the
setting
sun
i
was
before
scarcely
acquainted
with
their
existence
they
are
so
small
that
it
is
difficult
to
distinguish
them
they
are
carefully
improving
this
short
evening
space
not
daring
to
expose
themselves
to
the
blaze
of
our
meridian
sun
i
never
see
an
egg
brought
on
my
table
but
i
feel
penetrated
with
the
wonderful
change
it
would
have
undergone
but
for
my
gluttony
it
might
have
been
a
gentle
useful
hen
leading
her
chickens
with
a
care
and
vigilance
which
speaks
shame
to
many
women
a
cock
perhaps
arrayed
with
the
most
majestic
plumes
tender
to
its
mate
bold
courageous
endowed
with
an
astonishing
instinct
with
thoughts
with
memory
and
every
distinguishing
characteristic
of
the
reason
of
man
i
never
see
my
trees
drop
their
leaves
and
their
fruit
in
the
autumn
and
bud
again
in
the
spring
without
wonder
the
sagacity
of
those
animals
which
have
long
been
the
tenants
of
my
farm
astonish
me
some
of
them
seem
to
surpass
even
men
in
memory
and
sagacity
i
could
tell
you
singular
instances
of
that
kind
what
then
is
this
instinct
which
we
so
debase
and
of
which
we
are
taught
to
entertain
so
diminutive
an
idea
my
bees
above
any
other
tenants
of
my
farm
attract
my
attention
and
respect
i
am
astonished
to
see
that
nothing
exists
but
what
has
its
enemy
one
species
pursue
and
live
upon
the
other
unfortunately
our
kingbirds
are
the
destroyers
of
those
industrious
insects
but
on
the
other
hand
these
birds
preserve
our
fields
from
the
depredation
of
crows
which
they
pursue
on
the
wing
with
great
vigilance
and
astonishing
dexterity
thus
divided
by
two
interested
motives
i
have
long
resisted
the
desire
i
had
to
kill
them
until
last
year
when
i
thought
they
increased
too
much
and
my
indulgence
had
been
carried
too
far
it
was
at
the
time
of
swarming
when
they
all
came
and
fixed
themselves
on
the
neighbouring
trees
from
whence
they
catched
those
that
returned
loaded
from
the
fields
this
made
me
resolve
to
kill
as
many
as
i
could
and
i
was
just
ready
to
fire
when
a
bunch
of
bees
as
big
as
my
fist
issued
from
one
of
the
hives
rushed
on
one
of
the
birds
and
probably
stung
him
for
he
instantly
screamed
and
flew
not
as
before
in
an
irregular
manner
but
in
a
direct
line
he
was
followed
by
the
same
bold
phalanx
at
a
considerable
distance
which
unfortunately
becoming
too
sure
of
victory
quitted
their
military
array
and
disbanded
themselves
by
this
inconsiderate
step
they
lost
all
that
aggregate
of
force
which
had
made
the
bird
fly
off
perceiving
their
disorder
he
immediately
returned
and
snapped
as
many
as
he
wanted
nay
he
had
even
the
impudence
to
alight
on
the
very
twig
from
which
the
bees
had
drove
him
i
killed
him
and
immediately
opened
his
craw
from
which
i
took
bees
i
laid
them
all
on
a
blanket
in
the
sun
and
to
my
great
surprise
returned
to
life
licked
themselves
clean
and
joyfully
went
back
to
the
hive
where
they
probably
informed
their
companions
of
such
an
adventure
and
escape
as
i
believe
had
never
happened
before
to
american
bees
i
draw
a
great
fund
of
pleasure
from
the
quails
which
inhabit
my
farm
they
abundantly
repay
me
by
their
various
notes
and
peculiar
tameness
for
the
inviolable
hospitality
i
constantly
show
them
in
the
winter
instead
of
perfidiously
taking
advantage
of
their
great
and
affecting
distress
when
nature
offers
nothing
but
a
barren
universal
bed
of
snow
when
irresistible
necessity
forces
them
to
my
barn
doors
i
permit
them
to
feed
unmolested
and
it
is
not
the
least
agreeable
spectacle
which
that
dreary
season
presents
when
i
see
those
beautiful
birds
tamed
by
hunger
intermingling
with
all
my
cattle
and
sheep
seeking
in
security
for
the
poor
scanty
grain
which
but
for
them
would
be
useless
and
lost
often
in
the
angles
of
the
fences
where
the
motion
of
the
wind
prevents
the
snow
from
settling
i
carry
them
both
chaff
and
grain
the
one
to
feed
them
the
other
to
prevent
their
tender
feet
from
freezing
fast
to
the
earth
as
i
have
frequently
observed
them
to
do
i
do
not
know
an
instance
in
which
the
singular
barbarity
of
man
is
so
strongly
delineated
as
in
the
catching
and
murthering
those
harmless
birds
at
that
cruel
season
of
the
year
one
of
the
most
famous
and
extraordinary
farmers
that
has
ever
done
honour
to
the
province
of
connecticut
by
his
timely
and
humane
assistance
in
a
hard
winter
saved
this
species
from
being
entirely
destroyed
they
perished
all
over
the
country
none
of
their
delightful
whistlings
were
heard
the
next
spring
but
upon
this
farm
and
to
his
humanity
we
owe
the
continuation
of
their
music
when
the
severities
of
that
season
have
dispirited
all
my
cattle
no
farmer
ever
attends
them
with
more
pleasure
than
i
do
it
is
one
of
those
duties
which
is
sweetened
with
the
most
rational
satisfaction
i
amuse
myself
in
beholding
their
different
tempers
actions
and
the
various
effects
of
their
instinct
now
powerfully
impelled
by
the
force
of
hunger
i
trace
their
various
inclinations
and
the
different
effects
of
their
passions
which
are
exactly
the
same
as
among
men
the
law
is
to
us
precisely
what
i
am
in
my
barn
yard
a
bridle
and
check
to
prevent
the
strong
and
greedy
from
oppressing
the
timid
and
weak
conscious
of
superiority
they
always
strive
to
encroach
on
their
neighbours
unsatisfied
with
their
portion
they
eagerly
swallow
it
in
order
to
have
an
opportunity
of
taking
what
is
given
to
others
except
they
are
prevented
some
i
chide
others
unmindful
of
my
admonitions
receive
some
blows
could
victuals
thus
be
given
to
men
without
the
assistance
of
any
language
i
am
sure
they
would
not
behave
better
to
one
another
nor
more
philosophically
than
my
cattle
do
the
same
spirit
prevails
in
the
stable
but
there
i
have
to
do
with
more
generous
animals
there
my
voice
has
immediate
influence
and
soon
restores
peace
and
tranquillity
thus
by
superior
knowledge
i
govern
all
my
cattle
as
wise
men
are
obliged
to
govern
fools
and
the
ignorant
a
variety
of
other
thoughts
crowd
on
my
mind
at
that
peculiar
instant
but
they
all
vanish
by
the
time
i
return
home
if
in
a
cold
night
i
swiftly
travel
in
my
sledge
carried
along
at
the
rate
of
twelve
miles
an
hour
many
are
the
reflections
excited
by
surrounding
circumstances
i
ask
myself
what
sort
of
an
agent
is
that
which
we
call
frost
our
minister
compares
it
to
needles
the
points
of
which
enter
our
pores
what
is
become
of
the
heat
of
the
summer
in
what
part
of
the
world
is
it
that
the
keeps
these
grand
magazines
of
nitre
when
i
see
in
the
morning
a
river
over
which
i
can
travel
that
in
the
evening
before
was
liquid
i
am
astonished
indeed
what
is
become
of
those
millions
of
insects
which
played
in
our
summer
fields
and
in
our
evening
meadows
they
were
so
puny
and
so
delicate
the
period
of
their
existence
was
so
short
that
one
can
not
help
wondering
how
they
could
learn
in
that
short
space
the
sublime
art
to
hide
themselves
and
their
offspring
in
so
perfect
a
manner
as
to
baffle
the
rigour
of
the
season
and
preserve
that
precious
embryo
of
life
that
small
portion
of
ethereal
heat
which
if
once
destroyed
would
destroy
the
species
whence
that
irresistible
propensity
to
sleep
so
common
in
all
those
who
are
severely
attacked
by
the
frost
dreary
as
this
season
appears
yet
it
has
like
all
others
its
miracles
it
presents
to
man
a
variety
of
problems
which
he
can
never
resolve
among
the
rest
we
have
here
a
set
of
small
birds
which
never
appear
until
the
snow
falls
contrary
to
all
others
they
dwell
and
appear
to
delight
in
that
element
it
is
my
bees
however
which
afford
me
the
most
pleasing
and
extensive
themes
let
me
look
at
them
when
i
will
their
government
their
industry
their
quarrels
their
passions
always
present
me
with
something
new
for
which
reason
when
weary
with
labour
my
common
place
of
rest
is
under
my
close
by
my
by
their
movements
i
can
predict
the
weather
and
can
tell
the
day
of
their
swarming
but
the
most
difficult
point
is
when
on
the
wing
to
know
whether
they
want
to
go
to
the
woods
or
not
if
they
have
previously
pitched
in
some
hollow
trees
it
is
not
the
allurements
of
salt
and
water
of
fennel
hickory
leaves
nor
the
finest
box
that
can
induce
them
to
stay
they
will
prefer
those
rude
rough
habitations
to
the
best
polished
mahogany
hive
when
that
is
the
case
with
mine
i
seldom
thwart
their
inclinations
it
is
in
freedom
that
they
work
were
i
to
confine
them
they
would
dwindle
away
and
quit
their
labour
in
such
excursions
we
only
part
for
a
while
i
am
generally
sure
to
find
them
again
the
following
fall
this
elopement
of
theirs
only
adds
to
my
recreations
i
know
how
to
deceive
even
their
superlative
instinct
nor
do
i
fear
losing
them
though
eighteen
miles
from
my
house
and
lodged
in
the
most
lofty
trees
in
the
most
impervious
of
our
forests
i
once
took
you
along
with
me
in
one
of
these
rambles
and
yet
you
insist
on
my
repeating
the
detail
of
our
operations
it
brings
back
into
my
mind
many
of
the
useful
and
entertaining
reflections
with
which
you
so
happily
beguiled
our
tedious
hours
after
i
have
done
sowing
by
way
of
recreation
i
prepare
for
a
week
jaunt
in
the
woods
not
to
hunt
either
the
deer
or
the
bears
as
my
neighbours
do
but
to
catch
the
more
harmless
bees
i
can
not
boast
that
this
chase
is
so
noble
or
so
famous
among
men
but
i
find
it
less
fatiguing
and
full
as
profitable
and
the
last
consideration
is
the
only
one
that
moves
me
i
take
with
me
my
dog
as
a
companion
for
he
is
useless
as
to
this
game
my
gun
for
no
man
you
know
ought
to
enter
the
woods
without
one
my
blanket
some
provisions
some
wax
vermilion
honey
and
a
small
pocket
compass
with
these
implements
i
proceed
to
such
woods
as
are
at
a
considerable
distance
from
any
settlements
i
carefully
examine
whether
they
abound
with
large
trees
if
so
i
make
a
small
fire
on
some
flat
stones
in
a
convenient
place
on
the
fire
i
put
some
wax
close
by
this
fire
on
another
stone
i
drop
honey
in
distinct
drops
which
i
surround
with
small
quantities
of
vermilion
laid
on
the
stone
and
then
i
retire
carefully
to
watch
whether
any
bees
appear
if
there
are
any
in
that
neighbourhood
i
rest
assured
that
the
smell
of
the
burnt
wax
will
unavoidably
attract
them
they
will
soon
find
out
the
honey
for
they
are
fond
of
preying
on
that
which
is
not
their
own
and
in
their
approach
they
will
necessarily
tinge
themselves
with
some
particles
of
vermilion
which
will
adhere
long
to
their
bodies
i
next
fix
my
compass
to
find
out
their
course
which
they
keep
invariably
straight
when
they
are
returning
home
loaded
by
the
assistance
of
my
watch
i
observe
how
long
those
are
returning
which
are
marked
with
vermilion
thus
possessed
of
the
course
and
in
some
measure
of
the
distance
which
i
can
easily
guess
at
i
follow
the
first
and
seldom
fail
of
coming
to
the
tree
where
those
republics
are
lodged
i
then
mark
it
and
thus
with
patience
i
have
found
out
sometimes
eleven
swarms
in
a
season
and
it
is
inconceivable
what
a
quantity
of
honey
these
trees
will
sometimes
afford
it
entirely
depends
on
the
size
of
the
hollow
as
the
bees
never
rest
nor
swarm
till
it
is
all
replenished
for
like
men
it
is
only
the
want
of
room
that
induces
them
to
quit
the
maternal
hive
next
i
proceed
to
some
of
the
nearest
settlements
where
i
procure
proper
assistance
to
cut
down
the
trees
get
all
my
prey
secured
and
then
return
home
with
my
prize
the
first
bees
i
ever
procured
were
thus
found
in
the
woods
by
mere
accident
for
at
that
time
i
had
no
kind
of
skill
in
this
method
of
tracing
them
the
body
of
the
tree
being
perfectly
sound
they
had
lodged
themselves
in
the
hollow
of
one
of
its
principal
limbs
which
i
carefully
sawed
off
and
with
a
good
deal
of
labour
and
industry
brought
it
home
where
i
fixed
it
up
again
in
the
same
position
in
which
i
found
it
growing
this
was
in
april
i
had
five
swarms
that
year
and
they
have
been
ever
since
very
prosperous
this
business
generally
takes
up
a
week
of
my
time
every
fall
and
to
me
it
is
a
week
of
solitary
ease
and
relaxation
the
seed
is
by
that
time
committed
to
the
ground
there
is
nothing
very
material
to
do
at
home
and
this
additional
quantity
of
honey
enables
me
to
be
more
generous
to
my
home
bees
and
my
wife
to
make
a
due
quantity
of
mead
the
reason
sir
that
you
found
mine
better
than
that
of
others
is
that
she
puts
two
gallons
of
brandy
in
each
barrel
which
ripens
it
and
takes
off
that
sweet
luscious
taste
which
it
is
apt
to
retain
a
long
time
if
we
find
anywhere
in
the
woods
no
matter
on
whose
land
what
is
called
a
we
must
mark
it
in
the
fall
of
the
year
when
we
propose
to
cut
it
down
our
duty
is
to
inform
the
proprietor
of
the
land
who
is
entitled
to
half
the
contents
if
this
is
not
complied
with
we
are
exposed
to
an
action
of
trespass
as
well
as
he
who
should
go
and
cut
down
a
tree
which
he
had
neither
found
out
nor
marked
we
have
twice
a
year
the
pleasure
of
catching
pigeons
whose
numbers
are
sometimes
so
astonishing
as
to
obscure
the
sun
in
their
flight
where
is
it
that
they
hatch
for
such
multitudes
must
require
an
immense
quantity
of
food
i
fancy
they
breed
toward
the
plains
of
ohio
and
those
about
lake
michigan
which
abound
in
wild
oats
though
i
have
never
killed
any
that
had
that
grain
in
their
craws
in
one
of
them
last
year
i
found
some
undigested
rice
now
the
nearest
rice
fields
from
where
i
live
must
be
at
least
miles
and
either
their
digestion
must
be
suspended
while
they
are
flying
or
else
they
must
fly
with
the
celerity
of
the
wind
we
catch
them
with
a
net
extended
on
the
ground
to
which
they
are
allured
by
what
we
call
tame
wild
pigeons
made
blind
and
fastened
to
a
long
string
his
short
flights
and
his
repeated
calls
never
fail
to
bring
them
down
the
greatest
number
i
ever
catched
was
fourteen
dozen
though
much
larger
quantities
have
often
been
trapped
i
have
frequently
seen
them
at
the
market
so
cheap
that
for
a
penny
you
might
have
as
many
as
you
could
carry
away
and
yet
from
the
extreme
cheapness
you
must
not
conclude
that
they
are
but
an
ordinary
food
on
the
contrary
i
think
they
are
excellent
every
farmer
has
a
tame
wild
pigeon
in
a
cage
at
his
door
all
the
year
round
in
order
to
be
ready
whenever
the
season
comes
for
catching
them
the
pleasure
i
receive
from
the
warblings
of
the
birds
in
the
spring
is
superior
to
my
poor
description
as
the
continual
succession
of
their
tuneful
notes
is
for
ever
new
to
me
i
generally
rise
from
bed
about
that
indistinct
interval
which
properly
speaking
is
neither
night
or
day
for
this
is
the
moment
of
the
most
universal
vocal
choir
who
can
listen
unmoved
to
the
sweet
love
tales
of
our
robins
told
from
tree
to
tree
or
to
the
shrill
cat
birds
the
sublime
accents
of
the
thrush
from
on
high
always
retard
my
steps
that
i
may
listen
to
the
delicious
music
the
variegated
appearances
of
the
dew
drops
as
they
hang
to
the
different
objects
must
present
even
to
a
clownish
imagination
the
most
voluptuous
ideas
the
astonishing
art
which
all
birds
display
in
the
construction
of
their
nests
ill
provided
as
we
may
suppose
them
with
proper
tools
their
neatness
their
convenience
always
make
me
ashamed
of
the
slovenliness
of
our
houses
their
love
to
their
dame
their
incessant
careful
attention
and
the
peculiar
songs
they
address
to
her
while
she
tediously
incubates
their
eggs
remind
me
of
my
duty
could
i
ever
forget
it
their
affection
to
their
helpless
little
ones
is
a
lively
precept
and
in
short
the
whole
economy
of
what
we
proudly
call
the
brute
creation
is
admirable
in
every
circumstance
and
vain
man
though
adorned
with
the
additional
gift
of
reason
might
learn
from
the
perfection
of
instinct
how
to
regulate
the
follies
and
how
to
temper
the
errors
which
this
second
gift
often
makes
him
commit
this
is
a
subject
on
which
i
have
often
bestowed
the
most
serious
thoughts
i
have
often
blushed
within
myself
and
been
greatly
astonished
when
i
have
compared
the
unerring
path
they
all
follow
all
just
all
proper
all
wise
up
to
the
necessary
degree
of
perfection
with
the
coarse
the
imperfect
systems
of
men
not
merely
as
governors
and
kings
but
as
masters
as
husbands
as
fathers
as
citizens
but
this
is
a
sanctuary
in
which
an
ignorant
farmer
must
not
presume
to
enter
if
ever
man
was
permitted
to
receive
and
enjoy
some
blessings
that
might
alleviate
the
many
sorrows
to
which
he
is
exposed
it
is
certainly
in
the
country
when
he
attentively
considers
those
ravishing
scenes
with
which
he
is
everywhere
surrounded
this
is
the
only
time
of
the
year
in
which
i
am
avaricious
of
every
moment
i
therefore
lose
none
that
can
add
to
this
simple
and
inoffensive
happiness
i
roam
early
throughout
all
my
fields
not
the
least
operation
do
i
perform
which
is
not
accompanied
with
the
most
pleasing
observations
were
i
to
extend
them
as
far
as
i
have
carried
them
i
should
become
tedious
you
would
think
me
guilty
of
affectation
and
i
should
perhaps
represent
many
things
as
pleasurable
from
which
you
might
not
perhaps
receive
the
least
agreeable
emotions
but
believe
me
what
i
write
is
all
true
and
real
some
time
ago
as
i
sat
smoking
a
contemplative
pipe
in
my
piazza
i
saw
with
amazement
a
remarkable
instance
of
selfishness
displayed
in
a
very
small
bird
which
i
had
hitherto
respected
for
its
inoffensiveness
three
nests
were
placed
almost
contiguous
to
each
other
in
my
piazza
that
of
a
swallow
was
affixed
in
the
corner
next
to
the
house
that
of
a
phebe
in
the
other
a
wren
possessed
a
little
box
which
i
had
made
on
purpose
and
hung
between
be
not
surprised
at
their
tameness
all
my
family
had
long
been
taught
to
respect
them
as
well
as
myself
the
wren
had
shown
before
signs
of
dislike
to
the
box
which
i
had
given
it
but
i
knew
not
on
what
account
at
last
it
resolved
small
as
it
was
to
drive
the
swallow
from
its
own
habitation
and
to
my
very
great
surprise
it
succeeded
impudence
often
gets
the
better
of
modesty
and
this
exploit
was
no
sooner
performed
than
it
removed
every
material
to
its
own
box
with
the
most
admirable
dexterity
the
signs
of
triumph
appeared
very
visible
it
fluttered
its
wings
with
uncommon
velocity
an
universal
joy
was
perceivable
in
all
its
movements
where
did
this
little
bird
learn
that
spirit
of
injustice
it
was
not
endowed
with
what
we
term
reason
here
then
is
a
proof
that
both
those
gifts
border
very
near
on
one
another
for
we
see
the
perfection
of
the
one
mixing
with
the
errors
of
the
other
the
peaceable
swallow
like
the
passive
quaker
meekly
sat
at
a
small
distance
and
never
offered
the
least
resistance
but
no
sooner
was
the
plunder
carried
away
than
the
injured
bird
went
to
work
with
unabated
ardour
and
in
a
few
days
the
depredations
were
repaired
to
prevent
however
a
repetition
of
the
same
violence
i
removed
the
wren
box
to
another
part
of
the
house
in
the
middle
of
my
new
parlour
i
have
you
may
remember
a
curious
republic
of
industrious
hornets
their
nest
hangs
to
the
ceiling
by
the
same
twig
on
which
it
was
so
admirably
built
and
contrived
in
the
woods
its
removal
did
not
displease
them
for
they
find
in
my
house
plenty
of
food
and
i
have
left
a
hole
open
in
one
of
the
panes
of
the
window
which
answers
all
their
purposes
by
this
kind
usage
they
are
become
quite
harmless
they
live
on
the
flies
which
are
very
troublesome
to
us
throughout
the
summer
they
are
constantly
busy
in
catching
them
even
on
the
eyelids
of
my
children
it
is
surprising
how
quickly
they
smear
them
with
a
sort
of
glue
lest
they
might
escape
and
when
thus
prepared
they
carry
them
to
their
nests
as
food
for
their
young
ones
these
globular
nests
are
most
ingeniously
divided
into
many
stories
all
provided
with
cells
and
proper
communications
the
materials
with
which
this
fabric
is
built
they
procure
from
the
cottony
furze
with
which
our
oak
rails
are
covered
this
substance
tempered
with
glue
produces
a
sort
of
pasteboard
which
is
very
strong
and
resists
all
the
inclemencies
of
the
weather
by
their
assistance
i
am
but
little
troubled
with
flies
all
my
family
are
so
accustomed
to
their
strong
buzzing
that
no
one
takes
any
notice
of
them
and
though
they
are
fierce
and
vindictive
yet
kindness
and
hospitality
has
made
them
useful
and
harmless
we
have
a
great
variety
of
wasps
most
of
them
build
their
nests
in
mud
which
they
fix
against
the
shingles
of
our
roofs
as
nigh
the
pitch
as
they
can
these
aggregates
represent
nothing
at
first
view
but
coarse
and
irregular
lumps
but
if
you
break
them
you
will
observe
that
the
inside
of
them
contains
a
great
number
of
oblong
cells
in
which
they
deposit
their
eggs
and
in
which
they
bury
themselves
in
the
fall
of
the
year
thus
immured
they
securely
pass
through
the
severity
of
that
season
and
on
the
return
of
the
sun
are
enabled
to
perforate
their
cells
and
to
open
themselves
a
passage
from
these
recesses
into
the
sunshine
the
yellow
wasps
which
build
under
ground
in
our
meadows
are
much
more
to
be
dreaded
for
when
the
mower
unwittingly
passes
his
scythe
over
their
holes
they
immediately
sally
forth
with
a
fury
and
velocity
superior
even
to
the
strength
of
man
they
make
the
boldest
fly
and
the
only
remedy
is
to
lie
down
and
cover
our
heads
with
hay
for
it
is
only
at
the
head
they
aim
their
blows
nor
is
there
any
possibility
of
finishing
that
part
of
the
work
until
by
means
of
fire
and
brimstone
they
are
all
silenced
but
though
i
have
been
obliged
to
execute
this
dreadful
sentence
in
my
own
defence
i
have
often
thought
it
a
great
pity
for
the
sake
of
a
little
hay
to
lay
waste
so
ingenious
a
subterranean
town
furnished
with
every
conveniency
and
built
with
a
most
surprising
mechanism
i
never
should
have
done
were
i
to
recount
the
many
objects
which
involuntarily
strike
my
imagination
in
the
midst
of
my
work
and
spontaneously
afford
me
the
most
pleasing
relief
these
appear
insignificant
trifles
to
a
person
who
has
travelled
through
europe
and
america
and
is
acquainted
with
books
and
with
many
sciences
but
such
simple
objects
of
contemplation
suffice
me
who
have
no
time
to
bestow
on
more
extensive
observations
happily
these
require
no
study
they
are
obvious
they
gild
the
moments
i
dedicate
to
them
and
enliven
the
severe
labours
which
i
perform
at
home
my
happiness
springs
from
very
different
objects
the
gradual
unfolding
of
my
children
reason
the
study
of
their
dawning
tempers
attract
all
my
paternal
attention
i
have
to
contrive
little
punishments
for
their
little
faults
small
encouragements
for
their
good
actions
and
a
variety
of
other
expedients
dictated
by
various
occasions
but
these
are
themes
unworthy
your
perusal
and
which
ought
not
to
be
carried
beyond
the
walls
of
my
house
being
domestic
mysteries
adapted
only
to
the
locality
of
the
small
sanctuary
wherein
my
family
resides
sometimes
i
delight
in
inventing
and
executing
machines
which
simplify
my
wife
labour
i
have
been
tolerably
successful
that
way
and
these
sir
are
the
narrow
circles
within
which
i
constantly
revolve
and
what
can
i
wish
for
beyond
them
i
bless
god
for
all
the
good
he
has
given
me
i
envy
no
prosperity
and
with
no
other
portion
of
happiness
than
that
i
may
live
to
teach
the
same
philosophy
to
my
children
and
give
each
of
them
a
farm
show
them
how
to
cultivate
it
and
be
like
their
father
good
substantial
independent
american
farmers
an
appellation
which
will
be
the
most
fortunate
one
a
man
of
my
class
can
possess
so
long
as
our
civil
government
continues
to
shed
blessings
on
our
husbandry
adieu
letter
iii
what
is
an
american
i
wish
i
could
be
acquainted
with
the
feelings
and
thoughts
which
must
agitate
the
heart
and
present
themselves
to
the
mind
of
an
enlightened
englishman
when
he
first
lands
on
this
continent
he
must
greatly
rejoice
that
he
lived
at
a
time
to
see
this
fair
country
discovered
and
settled
he
must
necessarily
feel
a
share
of
national
pride
when
he
views
the
chain
of
settlements
which
embellishes
these
extended
shores
when
he
says
to
himself
this
is
the
work
of
my
countrymen
who
when
convulsed
by
factions
afflicted
by
a
variety
of
miseries
and
wants
restless
and
impatient
took
refuge
here
they
brought
along
with
them
their
national
genius
to
which
they
principally
owe
what
liberty
they
enjoy
and
what
substance
they
possess
here
he
sees
the
industry
of
his
native
country
displayed
in
a
new
manner
and
traces
in
their
works
the
embryos
of
all
the
arts
sciences
and
ingenuity
which
nourish
in
europe
here
he
beholds
fair
cities
substantial
villages
extensive
fields
an
immense
country
filled
with
decent
houses
good
roads
orchards
meadows
and
bridges
where
an
hundred
years
ago
all
was
wild
woody
and
uncultivated
what
a
train
of
pleasing
ideas
this
fair
spectacle
must
suggest
it
is
a
prospect
which
must
inspire
a
good
citizen
with
the
most
heartfelt
pleasure
the
difficulty
consists
in
the
manner
of
viewing
so
extensive
a
scene
he
is
arrived
on
a
new
continent
a
modern
society
offers
itself
to
his
contemplation
different
from
what
he
had
hitherto
seen
it
is
not
composed
as
in
europe
of
great
lords
who
possess
everything
and
of
a
herd
of
people
who
have
nothing
here
are
no
aristocratical
families
no
courts
no
kings
no
bishops
no
ecclesiastical
dominion
no
invisible
power
giving
to
a
few
a
very
visible
one
no
great
manufacturers
employing
thousands
no
great
refinements
of
luxury
the
rich
and
the
poor
are
not
so
far
removed
from
each
other
as
they
are
in
europe
some
few
towns
excepted
we
are
all
tillers
of
the
earth
from
nova
scotia
to
west
florida
we
are
a
people
of
cultivators
scattered
over
an
immense
territory
communicating
with
each
other
by
means
of
good
roads
and
navigable
rivers
united
by
the
silken
bands
of
mild
government
all
respecting
the
laws
without
dreading
their
power
because
they
are
equitable
we
are
all
animated
with
the
spirit
of
an
industry
which
is
unfettered
and
unrestrained
because
each
person
works
for
himself
if
he
travels
through
our
rural
districts
he
views
not
the
hostile
castle
and
the
haughty
mansion
contrasted
with
the
built
hut
and
miserable
cabin
where
cattle
and
men
help
to
keep
each
other
warm
and
dwell
in
meanness
smoke
and
indigence
a
pleasing
uniformity
of
decent
competence
appears
throughout
our
habitations
the
meanest
of
our
is
a
dry
and
comfortable
habitation
lawyer
or
merchant
are
the
fairest
titles
our
towns
afford
that
of
a
farmer
is
the
only
appellation
of
the
rural
inhabitants
of
our
country
it
must
take
some
time
ere
he
can
reconcile
himself
to
our
dictionary
which
is
but
short
in
words
of
dignity
and
names
of
honour
there
on
a
sunday
he
sees
a
congregation
of
respectable
farmers
and
their
wives
all
clad
in
neat
homespun
well
mounted
or
riding
in
their
own
humble
waggons
there
is
not
among
them
an
esquire
saving
the
unlettered
magistrate
there
he
sees
a
parson
as
simple
as
his
flock
a
farmer
who
does
not
riot
on
the
labour
of
others
we
have
no
princes
for
whom
we
toil
starve
and
bleed
we
are
the
most
perfect
society
now
existing
in
the
world
here
man
is
free
as
he
ought
to
be
nor
is
this
pleasing
equality
so
transitory
as
many
others
are
many
ages
will
not
see
the
shores
of
our
great
lakes
replenished
with
inland
nations
nor
the
unknown
bounds
of
north
america
entirely
peopled
who
can
tell
how
far
it
extends
who
can
tell
the
millions
of
men
whom
it
will
feed
and
contain
for
no
european
foot
has
as
yet
travelled
half
the
extent
of
this
mighty
continent
the
next
wish
of
this
traveller
will
be
to
know
whence
came
all
these
people
they
are
a
mixture
of
english
scotch
irish
french
dutch
germans
and
swedes
from
this
promiscuous
breed
that
race
now
called
americans
have
arisen
the
eastern
provinces
must
indeed
be
excepted
as
being
the
unmixed
descendants
of
englishmen
i
have
heard
many
wish
that
they
had
been
more
intermixed
also
for
my
part
i
am
no
wisher
and
think
it
much
better
as
it
has
happened
they
exhibit
a
most
conspicuous
figure
in
this
great
and
variegated
picture
they
too
enter
for
a
great
share
in
the
pleasing
perspective
displayed
in
these
thirteen
provinces
i
know
it
is
fashionable
to
reflect
on
them
but
i
respect
them
for
what
they
have
done
for
the
accuracy
and
wisdom
with
which
they
have
settled
their
territory
for
the
decency
of
their
manners
for
their
early
love
of
letters
their
ancient
college
the
first
in
this
hemisphere
for
their
industry
which
to
me
who
am
but
a
farmer
is
the
criterion
of
everything
there
never
was
a
people
situated
as
they
are
who
with
so
ungrateful
a
soil
have
done
more
in
so
short
a
time
do
you
think
that
the
monarchical
ingredients
which
are
more
prevalent
in
other
governments
have
purged
them
from
all
foul
stains
their
histories
assert
the
contrary
in
this
great
american
asylum
the
poor
of
europe
have
by
some
means
met
together
and
in
consequence
of
various
causes
to
what
purpose
should
they
ask
one
another
what
countrymen
they
are
alas
two
thirds
of
them
had
no
country
can
a
wretch
who
wanders
about
who
works
and
starves
whose
life
is
a
continual
scene
of
sore
affliction
or
pinching
penury
can
that
man
call
england
or
any
other
kingdom
his
country
a
country
that
had
no
bread
for
him
whose
fields
procured
him
no
harvest
who
met
with
nothing
but
the
frowns
of
the
rich
the
severity
of
the
laws
with
jails
and
punishments
who
owned
not
a
single
foot
of
the
extensive
surface
of
this
planet
no
urged
by
a
variety
of
motives
here
they
came
every
thing
has
tended
to
regenerate
them
new
laws
a
new
mode
of
living
a
new
social
system
here
they
are
become
men
in
europe
they
were
as
so
many
useless
plants
wanting
vegetative
mould
and
refreshing
showers
they
withered
and
were
mowed
down
by
want
hunger
and
war
but
now
by
the
power
of
transplantation
like
all
other
plants
they
have
taken
root
and
flourished
formerly
they
were
not
numbered
in
any
civil
lists
of
their
country
except
in
those
of
the
poor
here
they
rank
as
citizens
by
what
invisible
power
has
this
surprising
metamorphosis
been
performed
by
that
of
the
laws
and
that
of
their
industry
the
laws
the
indulgent
laws
protect
them
as
they
arrive
stamping
on
them
the
symbol
of
adoption
they
receive
ample
rewards
for
their
labours
these
accumulated
rewards
procure
them
lands
those
lands
confer
on
them
the
title
of
freemen
and
to
that
title
every
benefit
is
affixed
which
men
can
possibly
require
this
is
the
great
operation
daily
performed
by
our
laws
from
whence
proceed
these
laws
from
our
government
whence
the
government
it
is
derived
from
the
original
genius
and
strong
desire
of
the
people
ratified
and
confirmed
by
the
crown
this
is
the
great
chain
which
links
us
all
this
is
the
picture
which
every
province
exhibits
nova
scotia
excepted
there
the
crown
has
done
all
either
there
were
no
people
who
had
genius
or
it
was
not
much
attended
to
the
consequence
is
that
the
province
is
very
thinly
inhabited
indeed
the
power
of
the
crown
in
conjunction
with
the
musketos
has
prevented
men
from
settling
there
yet
some
parts
of
it
flourished
once
and
it
contained
a
mild
harmless
set
of
people
but
for
the
fault
of
a
few
leaders
the
whole
were
banished
the
greatest
political
error
the
crown
ever
committed
in
america
was
to
cut
off
men
from
a
country
which
wanted
nothing
but
men
what
attachment
can
a
poor
european
emigrant
have
for
a
country
where
he
had
nothing
the
knowledge
of
the
language
the
love
of
a
few
kindred
as
poor
as
himself
were
the
only
cords
that
tied
him
his
country
is
now
that
which
gives
him
land
bread
protection
and
consequence
ubi
panis
ibi
patria
is
the
motto
of
all
emigrants
what
then
is
the
american
this
new
man
he
is
either
an
european
or
the
descendant
of
an
european
hence
that
strange
mixture
of
blood
which
you
will
find
in
no
other
country
i
could
point
out
to
you
a
family
whose
grandfather
was
an
englishman
whose
wife
was
dutch
whose
son
married
a
french
woman
and
whose
present
four
sons
have
now
four
wives
of
different
nations
he
is
an
american
who
leaving
behind
him
all
his
ancient
prejudices
and
manners
receives
new
ones
from
the
new
mode
of
life
he
has
embraced
the
new
government
he
obeys
and
the
new
rank
he
holds
he
becomes
an
american
by
being
received
in
the
broad
lap
of
our
great
alma
mater
here
individuals
of
all
nations
are
melted
into
a
new
race
of
men
whose
labours
and
posterity
will
one
day
cause
great
changes
in
the
world
americans
are
the
western
pilgrims
who
are
carrying
along
with
them
that
great
mass
of
arts
sciences
vigour
and
industry
which
began
long
since
in
the
east
they
will
finish
the
great
circle
the
americans
were
once
scattered
all
over
europe
here
they
are
incorporated
into
one
of
the
finest
systems
of
population
which
has
ever
appeared
and
which
will
hereafter
become
distinct
by
the
power
of
the
different
climates
they
inhabit
the
american
ought
therefore
to
love
this
country
much
better
than
that
wherein
either
he
or
his
forefathers
were
born
here
the
rewards
of
his
industry
follow
with
equal
steps
the
progress
of
his
labour
his
labour
is
founded
on
the
basis
of
nature
can
it
want
a
stronger
allurement
wives
and
children
who
before
in
vain
demanded
of
him
a
morsel
of
bread
now
fat
and
frolicsome
gladly
help
their
father
to
clear
those
fields
whence
exuberant
crops
are
to
arise
to
feed
and
to
clothe
them
all
without
any
part
being
claimed
either
by
a
despotic
prince
a
rich
abbot
or
a
mighty
lord
here
religion
demands
but
little
of
him
a
small
voluntary
salary
to
the
minister
and
gratitude
to
god
can
he
refuse
these
the
american
is
a
new
man
who
acts
upon
new
principles
he
must
therefore
entertain
new
ideas
and
form
new
opinions
from
involuntary
idleness
servile
dependence
penury
and
useless
labour
he
has
passed
to
toils
of
a
very
different
nature
rewarded
by
ample
this
is
an
american
british
america
is
divided
into
many
provinces
forming
a
large
association
scattered
along
a
coast
miles
extent
and
about
wide
this
society
i
would
fain
examine
at
least
such
as
it
appears
in
the
middle
provinces
if
it
does
not
afford
that
variety
of
tinges
and
gradations
which
may
be
observed
in
europe
we
have
colours
peculiar
to
ourselves
for
instance
it
is
natural
to
conceive
that
those
who
live
near
the
sea
must
be
very
different
from
those
who
live
in
the
woods
the
intermediate
space
will
afford
a
separate
and
distinct
class
men
are
like
plants
the
goodness
and
flavour
of
the
fruit
proceeds
from
the
peculiar
soil
and
exposition
in
which
they
grow
we
are
nothing
but
what
we
derive
from
the
air
we
breathe
the
climate
we
inhabit
the
government
we
obey
the
system
of
religion
we
profess
and
the
nature
of
our
employment
here
you
will
find
but
few
crimes
these
have
acquired
as
yet
no
root
among
us
i
wish
i
was
able
to
trace
all
my
ideas
if
my
ignorance
prevents
me
from
describing
them
properly
i
hope
i
shall
be
able
to
delineate
a
few
of
the
outlines
which
are
all
i
propose
those
who
live
near
the
sea
feed
more
on
fish
than
on
flesh
and
often
encounter
that
boisterous
element
this
renders
them
more
bold
and
enterprising
this
leads
them
to
neglect
the
confined
occupations
of
the
land
they
see
and
converse
with
a
variety
of
people
their
intercourse
with
mankind
becomes
extensive
the
sea
inspires
them
with
a
love
of
traffic
a
desire
of
transporting
produce
from
one
place
to
another
and
leads
them
to
a
variety
of
resources
which
supply
the
place
of
labour
those
who
inhabit
the
middle
settlements
by
far
the
most
numerous
must
be
very
different
the
simple
cultivation
of
the
earth
purifies
them
but
the
indulgences
of
the
government
the
soft
remonstrances
of
religion
the
rank
of
independent
freeholders
must
necessarily
inspire
them
with
sentiments
very
little
known
in
europe
among
people
of
the
same
class
what
do
i
say
europe
has
no
such
class
of
men
the
early
knowledge
they
acquire
the
early
bargains
they
make
give
them
a
great
degree
of
sagacity
as
freemen
they
will
be
litigious
pride
and
obstinacy
are
often
the
cause
of
law
suits
the
nature
of
our
laws
and
governments
may
be
another
as
citizens
it
is
easy
to
imagine
that
they
will
carefully
read
the
newspapers
enter
into
every
political
disquisition
freely
blame
or
censure
governors
and
others
as
farmers
they
will
be
careful
and
anxious
to
get
as
much
as
they
can
because
what
they
get
is
their
own
as
northern
men
they
will
love
the
cheerful
cup
as
christians
religion
curbs
them
not
in
their
opinions
the
general
indulgence
leaves
every
one
to
think
for
themselves
in
spiritual
matters
the
laws
inspect
our
actions
our
thoughts
are
left
to
god
industry
good
living
selfishness
litigiousness
country
politics
the
pride
of
freemen
religious
indifference
are
their
characteristics
if
you
recede
still
farther
from
the
sea
you
will
come
into
more
modern
settlements
they
exhibit
the
same
strong
lineaments
in
a
ruder
appearance
religion
seems
to
have
still
less
influence
and
their
manners
are
less
improved
now
we
arrive
near
the
great
woods
near
the
last
inhabited
districts
there
men
seem
to
be
placed
still
farther
beyond
the
reach
of
government
which
in
some
measure
leaves
them
to
themselves
how
can
it
pervade
every
corner
as
they
were
driven
there
by
misfortunes
necessity
of
beginnings
desire
of
acquiring
large
tracts
of
land
idleness
frequent
want
of
economy
ancient
debts
the
of
such
people
does
not
afford
a
very
pleasing
spectacle
when
discord
want
of
unity
and
friendship
when
either
drunkenness
or
idleness
prevail
in
such
remote
districts
contention
inactivity
and
wretchedness
must
ensue
there
are
not
the
same
remedies
to
these
evils
as
in
a
long
established
community
the
few
magistrates
they
have
are
in
general
little
better
than
the
rest
they
are
often
in
a
perfect
state
of
war
that
of
man
against
man
sometimes
decided
by
blows
sometimes
by
means
of
the
law
that
of
man
against
every
wild
inhabitant
of
these
venerable
woods
of
which
they
are
come
to
dispossess
them
there
men
appear
to
be
no
better
than
carnivorous
animals
of
a
superior
rank
living
on
the
flesh
of
wild
animals
when
they
can
catch
them
and
when
they
are
not
able
they
subsist
on
grain
he
who
would
wish
to
see
america
in
its
proper
light
and
have
a
true
idea
of
its
feeble
beginnings
and
barbarous
rudiments
must
visit
our
extended
line
of
frontiers
where
the
last
settlers
dwell
and
where
he
may
see
the
first
labours
of
settlement
the
mode
of
clearing
the
earth
in
all
their
different
appearances
where
men
are
wholly
left
dependent
on
their
native
tempers
and
on
the
spur
of
uncertain
industry
which
often
fails
when
not
sanctified
by
the
efficacy
of
a
few
moral
rules
there
remote
from
the
power
of
example
and
check
of
shame
many
families
exhibit
the
most
hideous
parts
of
our
society
they
are
a
kind
of
forlorn
hope
preceding
by
ten
or
twelve
years
the
most
respectable
army
of
veterans
which
come
after
them
in
that
space
prosperity
will
polish
some
vice
and
the
law
will
drive
off
the
rest
who
uniting
again
with
others
like
themselves
will
recede
still
farther
making
room
for
more
industrious
people
who
will
finish
their
improvements
convert
the
loghouse
into
a
convenient
habitation
and
rejoicing
that
the
first
heavy
labours
are
finished
will
change
in
a
few
years
that
hitherto
barbarous
country
into
a
fine
fertile
well
regulated
district
such
is
our
progress
such
is
the
march
of
the
europeans
toward
the
interior
parts
of
this
continent
in
all
societies
there
are
this
impure
part
serves
as
our
precursors
or
pioneers
my
father
himself
was
one
of
that
class
but
he
came
upon
honest
principles
and
was
therefore
one
of
the
few
who
held
fast
by
good
conduct
and
temperance
he
transmitted
to
me
his
fair
inheritance
when
not
above
one
in
fourteen
of
his
contemporaries
had
the
same
good
fortune
forty
years
ago
this
smiling
country
was
thus
inhabited
it
is
now
purged
a
general
decency
of
manners
prevails
throughout
and
such
has
been
the
fate
of
our
best
countries
exclusive
of
those
general
characteristics
each
province
has
its
own
founded
on
the
government
climate
mode
of
husbandry
customs
and
peculiarity
of
circumstances
europeans
submit
insensibly
to
these
great
powers
and
become
in
the
course
of
a
few
generations
not
only
americans
in
general
but
either
pennsylvanians
virginians
or
provincials
under
some
other
name
whoever
traverses
the
continent
must
easily
observe
those
strong
differences
which
will
grow
more
evident
in
time
the
inhabitants
of
canada
massachusetts
the
middle
provinces
the
southern
ones
will
be
as
different
as
their
climates
their
only
points
of
unity
will
be
those
of
religion
and
language
as
i
have
endeavoured
to
show
you
how
europeans
become
americans
it
may
not
be
disagreeable
to
show
you
likewise
how
the
various
christian
sects
introduced
wear
out
and
how
religious
indifference
becomes
prevalent
when
any
considerable
number
of
a
particular
sect
happen
to
dwell
contiguous
to
each
other
they
immediately
erect
a
temple
and
there
worship
the
divinity
agreeably
to
their
own
peculiar
ideas
nobody
disturbs
them
if
any
new
sect
springs
up
in
europe
it
may
happen
that
many
of
its
professors
will
come
and
settle
in
american
as
they
bring
their
zeal
with
them
they
are
at
liberty
to
make
proselytes
if
they
can
and
to
build
a
meeting
and
to
follow
the
dictates
of
their
consciences
for
neither
the
government
nor
any
other
power
interferes
if
they
are
peaceable
subjects
and
are
industrious
what
is
it
to
their
neighbours
how
and
in
what
manner
they
think
fit
to
address
their
prayers
to
the
supreme
being
but
if
the
sectaries
are
not
settled
close
together
if
they
are
mixed
with
other
denominations
their
zeal
will
cool
for
want
of
fuel
and
will
be
extinguished
in
a
little
time
then
the
americans
become
as
to
religion
what
they
are
as
to
country
allied
to
all
in
them
the
name
of
englishman
frenchman
and
european
is
lost
and
in
like
manner
the
strict
modes
of
christianity
as
practised
in
europe
are
lost
also
this
effect
will
extend
itself
still
farther
hereafter
and
though
this
may
appear
to
you
as
a
strange
idea
yet
it
is
a
very
true
one
i
shall
be
able
perhaps
hereafter
to
explain
myself
better
in
the
meanwhile
let
the
following
example
serve
as
my
first
justification
let
us
suppose
you
and
i
to
be
travelling
we
observe
that
in
this
house
to
the
right
lives
a
catholic
who
prays
to
god
as
he
has
been
taught
and
believes
in
transubstantiation
he
works
and
raises
wheat
he
has
a
large
family
of
children
all
hale
and
robust
his
belief
his
prayers
offend
nobody
about
one
mile
farther
on
the
same
road
his
next
neighbour
may
be
a
good
honest
plodding
german
lutheran
who
addresses
himself
to
the
same
god
the
god
of
all
agreeably
to
the
modes
he
has
been
educated
in
and
believes
in
consubstantiation
by
so
doing
he
scandalises
nobody
he
also
works
in
his
fields
embellishes
the
earth
clears
swamps
etc
what
has
the
world
to
do
with
his
lutheran
principles
he
persecutes
nobody
and
nobody
persecutes
him
he
visits
his
neighbours
and
his
neighbours
visit
him
next
to
him
lives
a
seceder
the
most
enthusiastic
of
all
sectaries
his
zeal
is
hot
and
fiery
but
separated
as
he
is
from
others
of
the
same
complexion
he
has
no
congregation
of
his
own
to
resort
to
where
he
might
cabal
and
mingle
religious
pride
with
worldly
obstinacy
he
likewise
raises
good
crops
his
house
is
handsomely
painted
his
orchard
is
one
of
the
fairest
in
the
neighbourhood
how
does
it
concern
the
welfare
of
the
country
or
of
the
province
at
large
what
this
man
religious
sentiments
are
or
really
whether
he
has
any
at
all
he
is
a
good
farmer
he
is
a
sober
peaceable
good
citizen
william
penn
himself
would
not
wish
for
more
this
is
the
visible
character
the
invisible
one
is
only
guessed
at
and
is
nobody
business
next
again
lives
a
low
dutchman
who
implicitly
believes
the
rules
laid
down
by
the
synod
of
dort
he
conceives
no
other
idea
of
a
clergyman
than
that
of
an
hired
man
if
he
does
his
work
well
he
will
pay
him
the
stipulated
sum
if
not
he
will
dismiss
him
and
do
without
his
sermons
and
let
his
church
be
shut
up
for
years
but
notwithstanding
this
coarse
idea
you
will
find
his
house
and
farm
to
be
the
neatest
in
all
the
country
and
you
will
judge
by
his
waggon
and
fat
horses
that
he
thinks
more
of
the
affairs
of
this
world
than
of
those
of
the
next
he
is
sober
and
laborious
therefore
he
is
all
he
ought
to
be
as
to
the
affairs
of
this
life
as
for
those
of
the
next
he
must
trust
to
the
great
creator
each
of
these
people
instruct
their
children
as
well
as
they
can
but
these
instructions
are
feeble
compared
to
those
which
are
given
to
the
youth
of
the
poorest
class
in
europe
their
children
will
therefore
grow
up
less
zealous
and
more
indifferent
in
matters
of
religion
than
their
parents
the
foolish
vanity
or
rather
the
fury
of
making
proselytes
is
unknown
here
they
have
no
time
the
seasons
call
for
all
their
attention
and
thus
in
a
few
years
this
mixed
neighbourhood
will
exhibit
a
strange
religious
medley
that
will
be
neither
pure
catholicism
nor
pure
calvinism
a
very
perceptible
indifference
even
in
the
first
generation
will
become
apparent
and
it
may
happen
that
the
daughter
of
the
catholic
will
marry
the
son
of
the
seceder
and
settle
by
themselves
at
a
distance
from
their
parents
what
religious
education
will
they
give
their
children
a
very
imperfect
one
if
there
happens
to
be
in
the
neighbourhood
any
place
of
worship
we
will
suppose
a
meeting
rather
than
not
show
their
fine
clothes
they
will
go
to
it
and
some
of
them
may
perhaps
attach
themselves
to
that
society
others
will
remain
in
a
perfect
state
of
indifference
the
children
of
these
zealous
parents
will
not
be
able
to
tell
what
their
religious
principles
are
and
their
grandchildren
still
less
the
neighbourhood
of
a
place
of
worship
generally
leads
them
to
it
and
the
action
of
going
thither
is
the
strongest
evidence
they
can
give
of
their
attachment
to
any
sect
the
quakers
are
the
only
people
who
retain
a
fondness
for
their
own
mode
of
worship
for
be
they
ever
so
far
separated
from
each
other
they
hold
a
sort
of
communion
with
the
society
and
seldom
depart
from
its
rules
at
least
in
this
country
thus
all
sects
are
mixed
as
well
as
all
nations
thus
religious
indifference
is
imperceptibly
disseminated
from
one
end
of
the
continent
to
the
other
which
is
at
present
one
of
the
strongest
characteristics
of
the
americans
where
this
will
reach
no
one
can
tell
perhaps
it
may
leave
a
vacuum
fit
to
receive
other
systems
persecution
religious
pride
the
love
of
contradiction
are
the
food
of
what
the
world
commonly
calls
religion
these
motives
have
ceased
here
zeal
in
europe
is
confined
here
it
evaporates
in
the
great
distance
it
has
to
travel
there
it
is
a
grain
of
powder
inclosed
here
it
burns
away
in
the
open
air
and
consumes
without
effect
but
to
return
to
our
back
settlers
i
must
tell
you
that
there
is
something
in
the
proximity
of
the
woods
which
is
very
singular
it
is
with
men
as
it
is
with
the
plants
and
animals
that
grow
and
live
in
the
forests
they
are
entirely
different
from
those
that
live
in
the
plains
i
will
candidly
tell
you
all
my
thoughts
but
you
are
not
to
expect
that
i
shall
advance
any
reasons
by
living
in
or
near
the
woods
their
actions
are
regulated
by
the
wildness
of
the
neighbourhood
the
deer
often
come
to
eat
their
grain
the
wolves
to
destroy
their
sheep
the
bears
to
kill
their
hogs
the
foxes
to
catch
their
poultry
this
surrounding
hostility
immediately
puts
the
gun
into
their
hands
they
watch
these
animals
they
kill
some
and
thus
by
defending
their
property
they
soon
become
professed
hunters
this
is
the
progress
once
hunters
farewell
to
the
plough
the
chase
renders
them
ferocious
gloomy
and
unsociable
a
hunter
wants
no
neighbour
he
rather
hates
them
because
he
dreads
the
competition
in
a
little
time
their
success
in
the
woods
makes
them
neglect
their
tillage
they
trust
to
the
natural
fecundity
of
the
earth
and
therefore
do
little
carelessness
in
fencing
often
exposes
what
little
they
sow
to
destruction
they
are
not
at
home
to
watch
in
order
therefore
to
make
up
the
deficiency
they
go
oftener
to
the
woods
that
new
mode
of
life
brings
along
with
it
a
new
set
of
manners
which
i
can
not
easily
describe
these
new
manners
being
grafted
on
the
old
stock
produce
a
strange
sort
of
lawless
profligacy
the
impressions
of
which
are
indelible
the
manners
of
the
indian
natives
are
respectable
compared
with
this
european
medley
their
wives
and
children
live
in
sloth
and
inactivity
and
having
no
proper
pursuits
you
may
judge
what
education
the
latter
receive
their
tender
minds
have
nothing
else
to
contemplate
but
the
example
of
their
parents
like
them
they
grow
up
a
mongrel
breed
half
civilised
half
savage
except
nature
stamps
on
them
some
constitutional
propensities
that
rich
that
voluptuous
sentiment
is
gone
that
struck
them
so
forcibly
the
possession
of
their
freeholds
no
longer
conveys
to
their
minds
the
same
pleasure
and
pride
to
all
these
reasons
you
must
add
their
lonely
situation
and
you
can
not
imagine
what
an
effect
on
manners
the
great
distances
they
live
from
each
other
has
consider
one
of
the
last
settlements
in
its
first
view
of
what
is
it
composed
europeans
who
have
not
that
sufficient
share
of
knowledge
they
ought
to
have
in
order
to
prosper
people
who
have
suddenly
passed
from
oppression
dread
of
government
and
fear
of
laws
into
the
unlimited
freedom
of
the
woods
this
sudden
change
must
have
a
very
great
effect
on
most
men
and
on
that
class
particularly
eating
of
wild
meat
whatever
you
may
think
tends
to
alter
their
temper
though
all
the
proof
i
can
adduce
is
that
i
have
seen
it
and
having
no
place
of
worship
to
resort
to
what
little
society
this
might
afford
is
denied
them
the
sunday
meetings
exclusive
of
religious
benefits
were
the
only
social
bonds
that
might
have
inspired
them
with
some
degree
of
emulation
in
neatness
is
it
then
surprising
to
see
men
thus
situated
immersed
in
great
and
heavy
labours
degenerate
a
little
it
is
rather
a
wonder
the
effect
is
not
more
diffusive
the
moravians
and
the
quakers
are
the
only
instances
in
exception
to
what
i
have
advanced
the
first
never
settle
singly
it
is
a
colony
of
the
society
which
emigrates
they
carry
with
them
their
forms
worship
rules
and
decency
the
others
never
begin
so
hard
they
are
always
able
to
buy
improvements
in
which
there
is
a
great
advantage
for
by
that
time
the
country
is
recovered
from
its
first
barbarity
thus
our
bad
people
are
those
who
are
half
cultivators
and
half
hunters
and
the
worst
of
them
are
those
who
have
degenerated
altogether
into
the
hunting
state
as
old
ploughmen
and
new
men
of
the
woods
as
europeans
and
new
made
indians
they
contract
the
vices
of
both
they
adopt
the
moroseness
and
ferocity
of
a
native
without
his
mildness
or
even
his
industry
at
home
if
manners
are
not
refined
at
least
they
are
rendered
simple
and
inoffensive
by
tilling
the
earth
all
our
wants
are
supplied
by
it
our
time
is
divided
between
labour
and
rest
and
leaves
none
for
the
commission
of
great
misdeeds
as
hunters
it
is
divided
between
the
toil
of
the
chase
the
idleness
of
repose
or
the
indulgence
of
inebriation
hunting
is
but
a
licentious
idle
life
and
if
it
does
not
always
pervert
good
dispositions
yet
when
it
is
united
with
bad
luck
it
leads
to
want
want
stimulates
that
propensity
to
rapacity
and
injustice
too
natural
to
needy
men
which
is
the
fatal
gradation
after
this
explanation
of
the
effects
which
follow
by
living
in
the
woods
shall
we
yet
vainly
flatter
ourselves
with
the
hope
of
converting
the
indians
we
should
rather
begin
with
converting
our
settlers
and
now
if
i
dare
mention
the
name
of
religion
its
sweet
accents
would
be
lost
in
the
immensity
of
these
woods
men
thus
placed
are
not
fit
either
to
receive
or
remember
its
mild
instructions
they
want
temples
and
ministers
but
as
soon
as
men
cease
to
remain
at
home
and
begin
to
lead
an
erratic
life
let
them
be
either
tawny
or
white
they
cease
to
be
its
disciples
thus
have
i
faintly
and
imperfectly
endeavoured
to
trace
our
society
from
the
sea
to
our
woods
yet
you
must
not
imagine
that
every
person
who
moves
back
acts
upon
the
same
principles
or
falls
into
the
same
degeneracy
many
families
carry
with
them
all
their
decency
of
conduct
purity
of
morals
and
respect
of
religion
but
these
are
scarce
the
power
of
example
is
sometimes
irresistible
even
among
these
their
depravity
is
greater
or
less
according
to
what
nation
or
province
they
belong
were
i
to
adduce
proofs
of
this
i
might
be
accused
of
partiality
if
there
happens
to
be
some
rich
intervals
some
fertile
bottoms
in
those
remote
districts
the
people
will
there
prefer
tilling
the
land
to
hunting
and
will
attach
themselves
to
it
but
even
on
these
fertile
spots
you
may
plainly
perceive
the
inhabitants
to
acquire
a
great
degree
of
rusticity
and
selfishness
it
is
in
consequence
of
this
straggling
situation
and
the
astonishing
power
it
has
on
manners
that
the
of
both
the
carolinas
virginia
and
many
other
parts
have
been
long
a
set
of
lawless
people
it
has
been
even
dangerous
to
travel
among
them
government
can
do
nothing
in
so
extensive
a
country
better
it
should
wink
at
these
irregularities
than
that
it
should
use
means
inconsistent
with
its
usual
mildness
time
will
efface
those
stains
in
proportion
as
the
great
body
of
population
approaches
them
they
will
reform
and
become
polished
and
subordinate
whatever
has
been
said
of
the
four
new
england
provinces
no
such
degeneracy
of
manners
has
ever
tarnished
their
annals
their
have
been
kept
within
the
bounds
of
decency
and
government
by
means
of
wise
laws
and
by
the
influence
of
religion
what
a
detestable
idea
such
people
must
have
given
to
the
natives
of
the
europeans
they
trade
with
them
the
worst
of
people
are
permitted
to
do
that
which
none
but
persons
of
the
best
characters
should
be
employed
in
they
get
drunk
with
them
and
often
defraud
the
indians
their
avarice
removed
from
the
eyes
of
their
superiors
knows
no
bounds
and
aided
by
the
little
superiority
of
knowledge
these
traders
deceive
them
and
even
sometimes
shed
blood
hence
those
shocking
violations
those
sudden
devastations
which
have
so
often
stained
our
frontiers
when
hundreds
of
innocent
people
have
been
sacrificed
for
the
crimes
of
a
few
it
was
in
consequence
of
such
behaviour
that
the
indians
took
the
hatchet
against
the
virginians
in
thus
are
our
first
steps
trod
thus
are
our
first
trees
felled
in
general
by
the
most
vicious
of
our
people
and
thus
the
path
is
opened
for
the
arrival
of
a
second
and
better
class
the
true
american
freeholders
the
most
respectable
set
of
people
in
this
part
of
the
world
respectable
for
their
industry
their
happy
independence
the
great
share
of
freedom
they
possess
the
good
regulation
of
their
families
and
for
extending
the
trade
and
the
dominion
of
our
mother
country
europe
contains
hardly
any
other
distinctions
but
lords
and
tenants
this
fair
country
alone
is
settled
by
freeholders
the
possessors
of
the
soil
they
cultivate
members
of
the
government
they
obey
and
the
framers
of
their
own
laws
by
means
of
their
representatives
this
is
a
thought
which
you
have
taught
me
to
cherish
our
difference
from
europe
far
from
diminishing
rather
adds
to
our
usefulness
and
consequence
as
men
and
subjects
had
our
forefathers
remained
there
they
would
only
have
crowded
it
and
perhaps
prolonged
those
convulsions
which
had
shook
it
so
long
every
industrious
european
who
transports
himself
here
may
be
compared
to
a
sprout
growing
at
the
foot
of
a
great
tree
it
enjoys
and
draws
but
a
little
portion
of
sap
wrench
it
from
the
parent
roots
transplant
it
and
it
will
become
a
tree
bearing
fruit
also
colonists
are
therefore
entitled
to
the
consideration
due
to
the
most
useful
subjects
a
hundred
families
barely
existing
in
some
parts
of
scotland
will
here
in
six
years
cause
an
annual
exportation
of
bushels
of
wheat
bushels
being
but
a
common
quantity
for
an
industrious
family
to
sell
if
they
cultivate
good
land
it
is
here
then
that
the
idle
may
be
employed
the
useless
become
useful
and
the
poor
become
rich
but
by
riches
i
do
not
mean
gold
and
silver
we
have
but
little
of
those
metals
i
mean
a
better
sort
of
wealth
cleared
lands
cattle
good
houses
good
clothes
and
an
increase
of
people
to
enjoy
them
there
is
no
wonder
that
this
country
has
so
many
charms
and
presents
to
europeans
so
many
temptations
to
remain
in
it
a
traveller
in
europe
becomes
a
stranger
as
soon
as
he
quits
his
own
kingdom
but
it
is
otherwise
here
we
know
properly
speaking
no
strangers
this
is
every
person
country
the
variety
of
our
soils
situations
climates
governments
and
produce
hath
something
which
must
please
everybody
no
sooner
does
an
european
arrive
no
matter
of
what
condition
than
his
eyes
are
opened
upon
the
fair
prospect
he
hears
his
language
spoke
he
retraces
many
of
his
own
country
manners
he
perpetually
hears
the
names
of
families
and
towns
with
which
he
is
acquainted
he
sees
happiness
and
prosperity
in
all
places
disseminated
he
meets
with
hospitality
kindness
and
plenty
everywhere
he
beholds
hardly
any
poor
he
seldom
hears
of
punishments
and
executions
and
he
wonders
at
the
elegance
of
our
towns
those
miracles
of
industry
and
freedom
he
can
not
admire
enough
our
rural
districts
our
convenient
roads
good
taverns
and
our
many
accommodations
he
involuntarily
loves
a
country
where
everything
is
so
lovely
when
in
england
he
was
a
mere
englishman
here
he
stands
on
a
larger
portion
of
the
globe
not
less
than
its
fourth
part
and
may
see
the
productions
of
the
north
in
iron
and
naval
stores
the
provisions
of
ireland
the
grain
of
egypt
the
indigo
the
rice
of
china
he
does
not
find
as
in
europe
a
crowded
society
where
every
place
is
he
does
not
feel
that
perpetual
collision
of
parties
that
difficulty
of
beginning
that
contention
which
oversets
so
many
there
is
room
for
everybody
in
america
has
he
any
particular
talent
or
industry
he
exerts
it
in
order
to
procure
a
livelihood
and
it
succeeds
is
he
a
merchant
the
avenues
of
trade
are
infinite
is
he
eminent
in
any
respect
he
will
be
employed
and
respected
does
he
love
a
country
life
pleasant
farms
present
themselves
he
may
purchase
what
he
wants
and
thereby
become
an
american
farmer
is
he
a
labourer
sober
and
industrious
he
need
not
go
many
miles
nor
receive
many
informations
before
he
will
be
hired
well
fed
at
the
table
of
his
employer
and
paid
four
or
five
times
more
than
he
can
get
in
europe
does
he
want
uncultivated
lands
thousands
of
acres
present
themselves
which
he
may
purchase
cheap
whatever
be
his
talents
or
inclinations
if
they
are
moderate
he
may
satisfy
them
i
do
not
mean
that
every
one
who
comes
will
grow
rich
in
a
little
time
no
but
he
may
procure
an
easy
decent
maintenance
by
his
industry
instead
of
starving
he
will
be
fed
instead
of
being
idle
he
will
have
employment
and
these
are
riches
enough
for
such
men
as
come
over
here
the
rich
stay
in
europe
it
is
only
the
middling
and
the
poor
that
emigrate
would
you
wish
to
travel
in
independent
idleness
from
north
to
south
you
will
find
easy
access
and
the
most
cheerful
reception
at
every
house
society
without
ostentation
good
cheer
without
pride
and
every
decent
diversion
which
the
country
affords
with
little
expense
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
european
who
has
lived
here
a
few
years
is
desirous
to
remain
europe
with
all
its
pomp
is
not
to
be
compared
to
this
continent
for
men
of
middle
stations
or
labourers
an
european
when
he
first
arrives
seems
limited
in
his
intentions
as
well
as
in
his
views
but
he
very
suddenly
alters
his
scale
two
hundred
miles
formerly
appeared
a
very
great
distance
it
is
now
but
a
trifle
he
no
sooner
breathes
our
air
than
he
forms
schemes
and
embarks
in
designs
he
never
would
have
thought
of
in
his
own
country
there
the
plenitude
of
society
confines
many
useful
ideas
and
often
extinguishes
the
most
laudable
schemes
which
here
ripen
into
maturity
thus
europeans
become
americans
but
how
is
this
accomplished
in
that
crowd
of
low
indigent
people
who
flock
here
every
year
from
all
parts
of
europe
i
will
tell
you
they
no
sooner
arrive
than
they
immediately
feel
the
good
effects
of
that
plenty
of
provisions
we
possess
they
fare
on
our
best
food
and
they
are
kindly
entertained
their
talents
character
and
peculiar
industry
are
immediately
inquired
into
they
find
countrymen
everywhere
disseminated
let
them
come
from
whatever
part
of
europe
let
me
select
one
as
an
epitome
of
the
rest
he
is
hired
he
goes
to
work
and
works
moderately
instead
of
being
employed
by
a
haughty
person
he
finds
himself
with
his
equal
placed
at
the
substantial
table
of
the
farmer
or
else
at
an
inferior
one
as
good
his
wages
are
high
his
bed
is
not
like
that
bed
of
sorrow
on
which
he
used
to
lie
if
he
behaves
with
propriety
and
is
faithful
he
is
caressed
and
becomes
as
it
were
a
member
of
the
family
he
begins
to
feel
the
effects
of
a
sort
of
resurrection
hitherto
he
had
not
lived
but
simply
vegetated
he
now
feels
himself
a
man
because
he
is
treated
as
such
the
laws
of
his
own
country
had
overlooked
him
in
his
insignificancy
the
laws
of
this
cover
him
with
their
mantle
judge
what
an
alteration
there
must
arise
in
the
mind
and
thoughts
of
this
man
he
begins
to
forget
his
former
servitude
and
dependence
his
heart
involuntarily
swells
and
glows
this
first
swell
inspires
him
with
those
new
thoughts
which
constitute
an
american
what
love
can
he
entertain
for
a
country
where
his
existence
was
a
burthen
to
him
if
he
is
a
generous
good
man
the
love
of
this
new
adoptive
parent
will
sink
deep
into
his
heart
he
looks
around
and
sees
many
a
prosperous
person
who
but
a
few
years
before
was
as
poor
as
himself
this
encourages
him
much
he
begins
to
form
some
little
scheme
the
first
alas
he
ever
formed
in
his
life
if
he
is
wise
he
thus
spends
two
or
three
years
in
which
time
he
acquires
knowledge
the
use
of
tools
the
modes
of
working
the
lands
felling
trees
etc
this
prepares
the
foundation
of
a
good
name
the
most
useful
acquisition
he
can
make
he
is
encouraged
he
has
gained
friends
he
is
advised
and
directed
he
feels
bold
he
purchases
some
land
he
gives
all
the
money
he
has
brought
over
as
well
as
what
he
has
earned
and
trusts
to
the
god
of
harvests
for
the
discharge
of
the
rest
his
good
name
procures
him
credit
he
is
now
possessed
of
the
deed
conveying
to
him
and
his
posterity
the
fee
simple
and
absolute
property
of
two
hundred
acres
of
land
situated
on
such
a
river
what
an
epocha
in
this
man
life
he
is
become
a
freeholder
from
perhaps
a
german
boor
he
is
now
an
american
a
pennsylvanian
an
english
subject
he
is
naturalised
his
name
is
enrolled
with
those
of
the
other
citizens
of
the
province
instead
of
being
a
vagrant
he
has
a
place
of
residence
he
is
called
the
inhabitant
of
such
a
county
or
of
such
a
district
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
counts
for
something
for
hitherto
he
has
been
a
cypher
i
only
repeat
what
i
have
heard
many
say
and
no
wonder
their
hearts
should
glow
and
be
agitated
with
a
multitude
of
feelings
not
easy
to
describe
from
nothing
to
start
into
being
from
a
servant
to
the
rank
of
a
master
from
being
the
slave
of
some
despotic
prince
to
become
a
free
man
invested
with
lands
to
which
every
municipal
blessing
is
annexed
what
a
change
indeed
it
is
in
consequence
of
that
change
that
he
becomes
an
american
this
great
metamorphosis
has
a
double
effect
it
extinguishes
all
his
european
prejudices
he
forgets
that
mechanism
of
subordination
that
servility
of
disposition
which
poverty
had
taught
him
and
sometimes
he
is
apt
to
forget
too
much
often
passing
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
if
he
is
a
good
man
he
forms
schemes
of
future
prosperity
he
proposes
to
educate
his
children
better
than
he
has
been
educated
himself
he
thinks
of
future
modes
of
conduct
feels
an
ardour
to
labour
he
never
felt
before
pride
steps
in
and
leads
him
to
everything
that
the
laws
do
not
forbid
he
respects
them
with
a
gratitude
he
looks
toward
the
east
toward
that
insular
government
from
whose
wisdom
all
his
new
felicity
is
derived
and
under
whose
wings
and
protection
he
now
lives
these
reflections
constitute
him
the
good
man
and
the
good
subject
ye
poor
europeans
ye
who
sweat
and
work
for
the
great
ye
who
are
obliged
to
give
so
many
sheaves
to
the
church
so
many
to
your
lords
so
many
to
your
government
and
have
hardly
any
left
for
yourselves
ye
who
are
held
in
less
estimation
than
favourite
hunters
or
useless
ye
who
only
breathe
the
air
of
nature
because
it
can
not
be
withheld
from
you
it
is
here
that
ye
can
conceive
the
possibility
of
those
feelings
i
have
been
describing
it
is
here
the
laws
of
naturalisation
invite
every
one
to
partake
of
our
great
labours
and
felicity
to
till
unrented
untaxed
lands
many
corrupted
beyond
the
power
of
amendment
have
brought
with
them
all
their
vices
and
disregarding
the
advantages
held
to
them
have
gone
on
in
their
former
career
of
iniquity
until
they
have
been
overtaken
and
punished
by
our
laws
it
is
not
every
emigrant
who
succeeds
no
it
is
only
the
sober
the
honest
and
industrious
happy
those
to
whom
this
transition
has
served
as
a
powerful
spur
to
labour
to
prosperity
and
to
the
good
establishment
of
children
born
in
the
days
of
their
poverty
and
who
had
no
other
portion
to
expect
but
the
rags
of
their
parents
had
it
not
been
for
their
happy
emigration
others
again
have
been
led
astray
by
this
enchanting
scene
their
new
pride
instead
of
leading
them
to
the
fields
has
kept
them
in
idleness
the
idea
of
possessing
lands
is
all
that
satisfies
them
though
surrounded
with
fertility
they
have
mouldered
away
their
time
in
inactivity
misinformed
husbandry
and
ineffectual
endeavours
how
much
wiser
in
general
the
honest
germans
than
almost
all
other
europeans
they
hire
themselves
to
some
of
their
wealthy
landsmen
and
in
that
apprenticeship
learn
everything
that
is
necessary
they
attentively
consider
the
prosperous
industry
of
others
which
imprints
in
their
minds
a
strong
desire
of
possessing
the
same
advantages
this
forcible
idea
never
quits
them
they
launch
forth
and
by
dint
of
sobriety
rigid
parsimony
and
the
most
persevering
industry
they
commonly
succeed
their
astonishment
at
their
first
arrival
from
germany
is
very
great
it
is
to
them
a
dream
the
contrast
must
be
powerful
indeed
they
observe
their
countrymen
flourishing
in
every
place
they
travel
through
whole
counties
where
not
a
word
of
english
is
spoken
and
in
the
names
and
the
language
of
the
people
they
retrace
germany
they
have
been
an
useful
acquisition
to
this
continent
and
to
pennsylvania
in
particular
to
them
it
owes
some
share
of
its
prosperity
to
their
mechanical
knowledge
and
patience
it
owes
the
finest
mills
in
all
america
the
best
teams
of
horses
and
many
other
advantages
the
recollection
of
their
former
poverty
and
slavery
never
quits
them
as
long
as
they
live
the
scotch
and
the
irish
might
have
lived
in
their
own
country
perhaps
as
poor
but
enjoying
more
civil
advantages
the
effects
of
their
new
situation
do
not
strike
them
so
forcibly
nor
has
it
so
lasting
an
effect
from
whence
the
difference
arises
i
know
not
but
out
of
twelve
families
of
emigrants
of
each
country
generally
seven
scotch
will
succeed
nine
german
and
four
irish
the
scotch
are
frugal
and
laborious
but
their
wives
can
not
work
so
hard
as
german
women
who
on
the
contrary
vie
with
their
husbands
and
often
share
with
them
the
most
severe
toils
of
the
field
which
they
understand
better
they
have
therefore
nothing
to
struggle
against
but
the
common
casualties
of
nature
the
irish
do
not
prosper
so
well
they
love
to
drink
and
to
quarrel
they
are
litigious
and
soon
take
to
the
gun
which
is
the
ruin
of
everything
they
seem
beside
to
labour
under
a
greater
degree
of
ignorance
in
husbandry
than
the
others
perhaps
it
is
that
their
industry
had
less
scope
and
was
less
exercised
at
home
i
have
heard
many
relate
how
the
land
was
parcelled
out
in
that
kingdom
their
ancient
conquest
has
been
a
great
detriment
to
them
by
their
landed
property
the
lands
possessed
by
a
few
are
leased
down
ad
infinitum
and
the
occupiers
often
pay
five
guineas
an
acre
the
poor
are
worse
lodged
there
than
anywhere
else
in
europe
their
potatoes
which
are
easily
raised
are
perhaps
an
inducement
to
laziness
their
wages
are
too
low
and
their
whisky
too
cheap
there
is
no
tracing
observations
of
this
kind
without
making
at
the
same
time
very
great
allowances
as
there
are
everywhere
to
be
found
a
great
many
exceptions
the
irish
themselves
from
different
parts
of
that
kingdom
are
very
different
it
is
difficult
to
account
for
this
surprising
locality
one
would
think
on
so
small
an
island
an
irishman
must
be
an
irishman
yet
it
is
not
so
they
are
different
in
their
aptitude
to
and
in
their
love
of
labour
the
scotch
on
the
contrary
are
all
industrious
and
saving
they
want
nothing
more
than
a
field
to
exert
themselves
in
and
they
are
commonly
sure
of
succeeding
the
only
difficulty
they
labour
under
is
that
technical
american
knowledge
which
requires
some
time
to
obtain
it
is
not
easy
for
those
who
seldom
saw
a
tree
to
conceive
how
it
is
to
be
felled
cut
up
and
split
into
rails
and
posts
as
i
am
fond
of
seeing
and
talking
of
prosperous
families
i
intend
to
finish
this
letter
by
relating
to
you
the
history
of
an
honest
scotch
hebridean
who
came
here
in
which
will
show
you
in
epitome
what
the
scotch
can
do
wherever
they
have
room
for
the
exertion
of
their
industry
whenever
i
hear
of
any
new
settlement
i
pay
it
a
visit
once
or
twice
a
year
on
purpose
to
observe
the
different
steps
each
settler
takes
the
gradual
improvements
the
different
tempers
of
each
family
on
which
their
prosperity
in
a
great
nature
depends
their
different
modifications
of
industry
their
ingenuity
and
contrivance
for
being
all
poor
their
life
requires
sagacity
and
prudence
in
the
evening
i
love
to
hear
them
tell
their
stories
they
furnish
me
with
new
ideas
i
sit
still
and
listen
to
their
ancient
misfortunes
observing
in
many
of
them
a
strong
degree
of
gratitude
to
god
and
the
government
many
a
well
meant
sermon
have
i
preached
to
some
of
them
when
i
found
laziness
and
inattention
to
prevail
who
could
refrain
from
wishing
well
to
these
new
countrymen
after
having
undergone
so
many
fatigues
who
could
withhold
good
advice
what
a
happy
change
it
must
be
to
descend
from
the
high
sterile
bleak
lands
of
scotland
where
everything
is
barren
and
cold
to
rest
on
some
fertile
farms
in
these
middle
provinces
such
a
transition
must
have
afforded
the
most
pleasing
satisfaction
the
following
dialogue
passed
at
an
where
i
lately
paid
a
visit
well
friend
how
do
you
do
now
i
am
come
fifty
odd
miles
on
purpose
to
see
you
how
do
you
go
on
with
your
new
cutting
and
slashing
very
well
good
sir
we
learn
the
use
of
the
axe
bravely
we
shall
make
it
out
we
have
a
belly
full
of
victuals
every
day
our
cows
run
about
and
come
home
full
of
milk
our
hogs
get
fat
of
themselves
in
the
woods
oh
this
is
a
good
country
god
bless
the
king
and
william
penn
we
shall
do
very
well
by
and
by
if
we
keep
our
healths
your
loghouse
looks
neat
and
light
where
did
you
get
these
shingles
one
of
our
neighbours
is
a
man
and
he
showed
us
how
to
split
them
out
of
now
for
a
barn
but
all
in
good
time
here
are
fine
trees
to
build
with
who
is
to
frame
it
sure
you
do
understand
that
work
yet
a
countryman
of
ours
who
has
been
in
america
these
ten
years
offers
to
wait
for
his
money
until
the
second
crop
is
lodged
in
it
what
did
you
give
for
your
land
shillings
per
acre
payable
in
seven
years
how
many
acres
have
you
got
an
hundred
and
fifty
that
is
enough
to
begin
with
is
not
your
land
pretty
hard
to
clear
yes
sir
hard
enough
but
it
would
be
harder
still
if
it
were
ready
cleared
for
then
we
should
have
no
timber
and
i
love
the
woods
much
the
land
is
nothing
without
them
have
not
you
found
out
any
bees
yet
no
sir
and
if
we
had
we
should
not
know
what
to
do
with
them
i
will
tell
you
by
and
by
you
are
very
kind
farewell
honest
man
god
prosper
you
whenever
you
travel
toward
inquire
for
he
will
entertain
you
kindly
provided
you
bring
him
good
tidings
from
your
family
and
farm
in
this
manner
i
often
visit
them
and
carefully
examine
their
houses
their
modes
of
ingenuity
their
different
ways
and
make
them
all
relate
all
they
know
and
describe
all
they
feel
these
are
scenes
which
i
believe
you
would
willingly
share
with
me
i
well
remember
your
philanthropic
turn
of
mind
is
it
not
better
to
contemplate
under
these
humble
roofs
the
rudiments
of
future
wealth
and
population
than
to
behold
the
accumulated
bundles
of
litigious
papers
in
the
office
of
a
lawyer
to
examine
how
the
world
is
gradually
settled
how
the
howling
swamp
is
converted
into
a
pleasing
meadow
the
rough
ridge
into
a
fine
field
and
to
hear
the
cheerful
whistling
the
rural
song
where
there
was
no
sound
heard
before
save
the
yell
of
the
savage
the
screech
of
the
owl
or
the
hissing
of
the
snake
here
an
european
fatigued
with
luxury
riches
and
pleasures
may
find
a
sweet
relaxation
in
a
series
of
interesting
scenes
as
affecting
as
they
are
new
england
which
now
contains
so
many
domes
so
many
castles
was
once
like
this
a
place
woody
and
marshy
its
inhabitants
now
the
favourite
nation
for
arts
and
commerce
were
once
painted
like
our
neighbours
the
country
will
nourish
in
its
turn
and
the
same
observations
will
be
made
which
i
have
just
delineated
posterity
will
look
back
with
avidity
and
pleasure
to
trace
if
possible
the
era
of
this
or
that
particular
settlement
pray
what
is
the
reason
that
the
scots
are
in
general
more
religious
more
faithful
more
honest
and
industrious
than
the
irish
i
do
not
mean
to
insinuate
national
reflections
god
forbid
it
ill
becomes
any
man
and
much
less
an
american
but
as
i
know
men
are
nothing
of
themselves
and
that
they
owe
all
their
different
modifications
either
to
government
or
other
local
circumstances
there
must
be
some
powerful
causes
which
constitute
this
great
national
difference
agreeable
to
the
account
which
several
scotchmen
have
given
me
of
the
north
of
britain
of
the
orkneys
and
the
hebride
islands
they
seem
on
many
accounts
to
be
unfit
for
the
habitation
of
men
they
appear
to
be
calculated
only
for
great
sheep
pastures
who
then
can
blame
the
inhabitants
of
these
countries
for
transporting
themselves
hither
this
great
continent
must
in
time
absorb
the
poorest
part
of
europe
and
this
will
happen
in
proportion
as
it
becomes
better
known
and
as
war
taxation
oppression
and
misery
increase
there
the
hebrides
appear
to
be
fit
only
for
the
residence
of
malefactors
and
it
would
be
much
better
to
send
felons
there
than
either
to
virginia
or
maryland
what
a
strange
compliment
has
our
mother
country
paid
to
two
of
the
finest
provinces
in
america
england
has
entertained
in
that
respect
very
mistaken
ideas
what
was
intended
as
a
punishment
is
become
the
good
fortune
of
several
many
of
those
who
have
been
transported
as
felons
are
now
rich
and
strangers
to
the
stings
of
those
wants
that
urged
them
to
violations
of
the
law
they
are
become
industrious
exemplary
and
useful
citizens
the
english
government
should
purchase
the
most
northern
and
barren
of
those
islands
it
should
send
over
to
us
the
honest
primitive
hebrideans
settle
them
here
on
good
lands
as
a
reward
for
their
virtue
and
ancient
poverty
and
replace
them
with
a
colony
of
her
wicked
sons
the
severity
of
the
climate
the
inclemency
of
the
seasons
the
sterility
of
the
soil
the
tempestuousness
of
the
sea
would
afflict
and
punish
enough
could
there
be
found
a
spot
better
adapted
to
retaliate
the
injury
it
had
received
by
their
crimes
some
of
those
islands
might
be
considered
as
the
hell
of
great
britain
where
all
evil
spirits
should
be
sent
two
essential
ends
would
be
answered
by
this
simple
operation
the
good
people
by
emigration
would
be
rendered
happier
the
bad
ones
would
be
placed
where
they
ought
to
be
in
a
few
years
the
dread
of
being
sent
to
that
wintry
region
would
have
a
much
stronger
effect
than
that
of
this
is
no
place
of
punishment
were
i
a
poor
hopeless
breadless
englishman
and
not
restrained
by
the
power
of
shame
i
should
be
very
thankful
for
the
passage
it
is
of
very
little
importance
how
and
in
what
manner
an
indigent
man
arrives
for
if
he
is
but
sober
honest
and
industrious
he
has
nothing
more
to
ask
of
heaven
let
him
go
to
work
he
will
have
opportunities
enough
to
earn
a
comfortable
support
and
even
the
means
of
procuring
some
land
which
ought
to
be
the
utmost
wish
of
every
person
who
has
health
and
hands
to
work
i
knew
a
man
who
came
to
this
country
in
the
literal
sense
of
the
expression
stark
naked
i
think
he
was
a
frenchman
and
a
sailor
on
board
an
english
war
being
discontented
he
had
stripped
himself
and
swam
ashore
where
finding
clothes
and
friends
he
settled
afterwards
at
maraneck
in
the
county
of
chester
in
the
province
of
new
york
he
married
and
left
a
good
farm
to
each
of
his
sons
i
knew
another
person
who
was
but
twelve
years
old
when
he
was
taken
on
the
frontiers
of
canada
by
the
indians
at
his
arrival
at
albany
he
was
purchased
by
a
gentleman
who
generously
bound
him
apprentice
to
a
tailor
he
lived
to
the
age
of
ninety
and
left
behind
him
a
fine
estate
and
a
numerous
family
all
well
settled
many
of
them
i
am
acquainted
where
is
then
the
industrious
european
who
ought
to
despair
after
a
foreigner
from
any
part
of
europe
is
arrived
and
become
a
citizen
let
him
devoutly
listen
to
the
voice
of
our
great
parent
which
says
to
him
welcome
to
my
shores
distressed
european
bless
the
hour
in
which
thou
didst
see
my
verdant
fields
my
fair
navigable
rivers
and
my
green
mountains
if
thou
wilt
work
i
have
bread
for
thee
if
thou
wilt
be
honest
sober
and
industrious
i
have
greater
rewards
to
confer
on
thee
ease
and
independence
i
will
give
thee
fields
to
feed
and
clothe
thee
a
comfortable
fireside
to
sit
by
and
tell
thy
children
by
what
means
thou
hast
prospered
and
a
decent
bed
to
repose
on
i
shall
endow
thee
beside
with
the
immunities
of
a
freeman
if
thou
wilt
carefully
educate
thy
children
teach
them
gratitude
to
god
and
reverence
to
that
government
that
philanthropic
government
which
has
collected
here
so
many
men
and
made
them
happy
i
will
also
provide
for
thy
progeny
and
to
every
good
man
this
ought
to
be
the
most
holy
the
most
powerful
the
most
earnest
wish
he
can
possibly
form
as
well
as
the
most
consolatory
prospect
when
he
dies
go
thou
and
work
and
till
thou
shalt
prosper
provided
thou
be
just
grateful
and
industrious
history
of
andrew
the
hebridean
let
historians
give
the
detail
of
our
charters
the
succession
of
our
several
governors
and
of
their
administrations
of
our
political
struggles
and
of
the
foundation
of
our
towns
let
annalists
amuse
themselves
with
collecting
anecdotes
of
the
establishment
of
our
modern
provinces
eagles
soar
high
i
a
feebler
bird
cheerfully
content
myself
with
skipping
from
bush
to
bush
and
living
on
insignificant
insects
i
am
so
habituated
to
draw
all
my
food
and
pleasure
from
the
surface
of
the
earth
which
i
till
that
i
can
not
nor
indeed
am
i
able
to
quit
it
i
therefore
present
you
with
the
short
history
of
a
simple
scotchman
though
it
contain
not
a
single
remarkable
event
to
amaze
the
reader
no
tragical
scene
to
convulse
the
heart
or
pathetic
narrative
to
draw
tears
from
sympathetic
eyes
all
i
wish
to
delineate
is
the
progressive
steps
of
a
poor
man
advancing
from
indigence
to
ease
from
oppression
to
freedom
from
obscurity
and
contumely
to
some
degree
of
consequence
not
by
virtue
of
any
freaks
of
fortune
but
by
the
gradual
operation
of
sobriety
honesty
and
emigration
these
are
the
limited
fields
through
which
i
love
to
wander
sure
to
find
in
some
parts
the
smile
of
happiness
the
glad
heart
inspiring
the
cheerful
song
the
glow
of
manly
pride
excited
by
vivid
hopes
and
rising
independence
i
always
return
from
my
neighbourly
excursions
extremely
happy
because
there
i
see
good
living
almost
under
every
roof
and
prosperous
endeavours
almost
in
every
field
but
you
may
say
why
do
you
describe
some
of
the
more
ancient
opulent
settlements
of
our
country
where
even
the
eye
of
an
european
has
something
to
admire
it
is
true
our
american
fields
are
in
general
pleasing
to
behold
adorned
and
intermixed
as
they
are
with
so
many
substantial
houses
flourishing
orchards
and
copses
of
woodlands
the
pride
of
our
farms
the
source
of
every
good
we
possess
but
what
i
might
observe
there
is
but
natural
and
common
for
to
draw
comfortable
subsistence
from
well
fenced
cultivated
fields
is
easy
to
conceive
a
father
dies
and
leaves
a
decent
house
and
rich
farm
to
his
son
the
son
modernises
the
one
and
carefully
tills
the
other
marries
the
daughter
of
a
friend
and
neighbour
this
is
the
common
prospect
but
though
it
is
rich
and
pleasant
yet
it
is
far
from
being
so
entertaining
and
instructive
as
the
one
now
in
my
view
i
had
rather
attend
on
the
shore
to
welcome
the
poor
european
when
he
arrives
i
observe
him
in
his
first
moments
of
embarrassment
trace
him
throughout
his
primary
difficulties
follow
him
step
by
step
until
he
pitches
his
tent
on
some
piece
of
land
and
realises
that
energetic
wish
which
has
made
him
quit
his
native
land
his
kindred
and
induced
him
to
traverse
a
boisterous
ocean
it
is
there
i
want
to
observe
his
first
thoughts
and
feelings
the
first
essays
of
an
industry
which
hitherto
has
been
suppressed
i
wish
to
see
men
cut
down
the
first
trees
erect
their
new
buildings
till
their
first
fields
reap
their
first
crops
and
say
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
this
is
our
own
grain
raised
from
american
soil
on
it
we
shall
feed
and
grow
fat
and
convert
the
rest
into
gold
and
silver
i
want
to
see
how
the
happy
effects
of
their
sobriety
honesty
and
industry
are
first
displayed
and
who
would
not
take
a
pleasure
in
seeing
these
strangers
settling
as
new
countrymen
struggling
with
arduous
difficulties
overcoming
them
and
becoming
happy
landing
on
this
great
continent
is
like
going
to
sea
they
must
have
a
compass
some
friendly
directing
needle
or
else
they
will
uselessly
err
and
wander
for
a
long
time
even
with
a
fair
wind
yet
these
are
the
struggles
through
which
our
forefathers
have
waded
and
they
have
left
us
no
other
records
of
them
but
the
possession
of
our
farms
the
reflections
i
make
on
these
new
settlers
recall
to
my
mind
what
my
grandfather
did
in
his
days
they
fill
me
with
gratitude
to
his
memory
as
well
as
to
that
government
which
invited
him
to
come
and
helped
him
when
he
arrived
as
well
as
many
others
can
i
pass
over
these
reflections
without
remembering
thy
name
o
penn
thou
best
of
legislators
who
by
the
wisdom
of
thy
laws
hast
endowed
human
nature
within
the
bounds
of
thy
province
with
every
dignity
it
can
possibly
enjoy
in
a
civilised
state
and
showed
by
thy
singular
establishment
what
all
men
might
be
if
they
would
follow
thy
example
in
the
year
i
purchased
some
lands
in
the
county
of
which
i
intended
for
one
of
my
sons
and
was
obliged
to
go
there
in
order
to
see
them
properly
surveyed
and
marked
out
the
soil
is
good
but
the
country
has
a
very
wild
aspect
however
i
observed
with
pleasure
that
land
sells
very
fast
and
i
am
in
hopes
when
the
lad
gets
a
wife
it
will
be
a
decent
country
agreeable
to
our
customs
which
indeed
are
those
of
nature
it
is
our
duty
to
provide
for
our
eldest
children
while
we
live
in
order
that
our
homesteads
may
be
left
to
the
youngest
who
are
the
most
helpless
some
people
are
apt
to
regard
the
portions
given
to
daughters
as
so
much
lost
to
the
family
but
this
is
selfish
and
is
not
agreeable
to
my
way
of
thinking
they
can
not
work
as
men
do
they
marry
young
i
have
given
an
honest
european
a
farm
to
till
for
himself
rent
free
provided
he
clears
an
acre
of
swamp
every
year
and
that
he
quits
it
whenever
my
daughter
shall
marry
it
will
procure
her
a
substantial
husband
a
good
farmer
and
that
is
all
my
ambition
whilst
i
was
in
the
woods
i
met
with
a
party
of
indians
i
shook
hands
with
them
and
i
perceived
they
had
killed
a
cub
i
had
a
little
peach
brandy
they
perceived
it
also
we
therefore
joined
company
kindled
a
large
fire
and
ate
an
hearty
supper
i
made
their
hearts
glad
and
we
all
reposed
on
good
beds
of
leaves
soon
after
dark
i
was
surprised
to
hear
a
prodigious
hooting
through
the
woods
the
indians
laughed
heartily
one
of
them
more
skilful
than
the
rest
mimicked
the
owls
so
exactly
that
a
very
large
one
perched
on
a
high
tree
over
our
fire
we
soon
brought
him
down
he
measured
five
feet
seven
inches
from
one
extremity
of
the
wings
to
the
other
by
captain
i
have
sent
you
the
talons
on
which
i
have
had
the
heads
of
small
candlesticks
fixed
pray
keep
them
on
the
table
of
your
study
for
my
sake
contrary
to
my
expectation
i
found
myself
under
the
necessity
of
going
to
philadelphia
in
order
to
pay
the
purchase
money
and
to
have
the
deeds
properly
recorded
i
thought
little
of
the
journey
though
it
was
above
two
hundred
miles
because
i
was
well
acquainted
with
many
friends
at
whose
houses
i
intended
to
stop
the
third
night
after
i
left
the
woods
i
put
up
at
the
most
worthy
citizen
i
know
he
happened
to
lodge
at
my
house
when
you
was
he
kindly
inquired
after
your
welfare
and
desired
i
would
make
a
friendly
mention
of
him
to
you
the
neatness
of
these
good
people
is
no
phenomenon
yet
i
think
this
excellent
family
surpasses
everything
i
know
no
sooner
did
i
lie
down
to
rest
than
i
thought
myself
in
a
most
odoriferous
arbour
so
sweet
and
fragrant
were
the
sheets
next
morning
i
found
my
host
in
the
orchard
destroying
caterpillars
i
think
friend
said
i
that
thee
art
greatly
departed
from
the
good
rules
of
the
society
thee
seemeth
to
have
quitted
that
happy
simplicity
for
which
it
hath
hitherto
been
so
remarkable
thy
rebuke
friend
james
is
a
pretty
heavy
one
what
motive
canst
thee
have
for
thus
accusing
us
thy
kind
wife
made
a
mistake
last
evening
i
said
she
put
me
on
a
bed
of
roses
instead
of
a
common
one
i
am
not
used
to
such
delicacies
and
is
that
all
friend
james
that
thee
hast
to
reproach
us
with
thee
wilt
not
call
it
luxury
i
hope
thee
canst
but
know
that
it
is
the
produce
of
our
garden
and
friend
pope
sayeth
that
to
enjoy
is
to
obey
this
is
a
most
learned
excuse
indeed
friend
and
must
be
valued
because
it
is
founded
upon
truth
james
my
wife
hath
done
nothing
more
to
thy
bed
than
what
is
done
all
the
year
round
to
all
the
beds
in
the
family
she
sprinkles
her
linen
with
before
she
puts
it
under
the
press
it
is
her
fancy
and
i
have
nought
to
say
but
thee
shalt
not
escape
so
verily
i
will
send
for
her
thee
and
she
must
settle
the
matter
whilst
i
proceed
on
my
work
before
the
sun
gets
too
tom
go
thou
and
call
thy
mistress
philadelphia
what
said
i
is
thy
wife
called
by
that
name
i
did
not
know
that
before
i
tell
thee
james
how
it
came
to
pass
her
grandmother
was
the
first
female
child
born
after
william
penn
landed
with
the
rest
of
our
brethren
and
in
compliment
to
the
city
he
intended
to
build
she
was
called
after
the
name
he
intended
to
give
it
and
so
there
is
always
one
of
the
daughters
of
her
family
known
by
the
name
of
philadelphia
she
soon
came
and
after
a
most
friendly
altercation
i
gave
up
the
point
breakfasted
departed
and
in
four
days
reached
the
city
a
week
after
news
came
that
a
vessel
was
arrived
with
scotch
emigrants
and
i
went
to
the
dock
to
see
them
disembark
it
was
a
scene
which
inspired
me
with
a
variety
of
thoughts
here
are
said
i
to
my
friend
a
number
of
people
driven
by
poverty
and
other
adverse
causes
to
a
foreign
land
in
which
they
know
nobody
the
name
of
a
stranger
instead
of
implying
relief
assistance
and
kindness
on
the
contrary
conveys
very
different
ideas
they
are
now
distressed
their
minds
are
racked
by
a
variety
of
apprehensions
fears
and
hopes
it
was
this
last
powerful
sentiment
which
has
brought
them
here
if
they
are
good
people
i
pray
that
heaven
may
realise
them
whoever
were
to
see
them
thus
gathered
again
in
five
or
six
years
would
behold
a
more
pleasing
sight
to
which
this
would
serve
as
a
very
powerful
contrast
by
their
honesty
the
vigour
of
their
arms
and
the
benignity
of
government
their
condition
will
be
greatly
improved
they
will
be
well
clad
fat
possessed
of
that
manly
confidence
which
property
confers
they
will
become
useful
citizens
some
of
the
posterity
may
act
conspicuous
parts
in
our
future
american
transactions
most
of
them
appeared
pale
and
emaciated
from
the
length
of
the
passage
and
the
indifferent
provision
on
which
they
had
lived
the
number
of
children
seemed
as
great
as
that
of
the
people
they
had
all
paid
for
being
conveyed
here
the
captain
told
us
they
were
a
quiet
peaceable
and
harmless
people
who
had
never
dwelt
in
cities
this
was
a
valuable
cargo
they
seemed
a
few
excepted
to
be
in
the
full
vigour
of
their
lives
several
citizens
impelled
either
by
spontaneous
attachments
or
motives
of
humanity
took
many
of
them
to
their
houses
the
city
agreeable
to
its
usual
wisdom
and
humanity
ordered
them
all
to
be
lodged
in
the
barracks
and
plenty
of
provisions
to
be
given
them
my
friend
pitched
upon
one
also
and
led
him
to
his
house
with
his
wife
and
a
son
about
fourteen
years
of
age
the
majority
of
them
had
contracted
for
land
the
year
before
by
means
of
an
agent
the
rest
depended
entirely
upon
chance
and
the
one
who
followed
us
was
of
this
last
class
poor
man
he
smiled
on
receiving
the
invitation
and
gladly
accepted
it
bidding
his
wife
and
son
do
the
same
in
a
language
which
i
did
not
understand
he
gazed
with
uninterrupted
attention
on
everything
he
saw
the
houses
the
inhabitants
the
negroes
and
carriages
everything
appeared
equally
new
to
him
and
we
went
slow
in
order
to
give
him
time
to
feed
on
this
pleasing
variety
good
god
said
he
is
this
philadelphia
that
blessed
city
of
bread
and
provisions
of
which
we
have
heard
so
much
i
am
told
it
was
founded
the
same
year
in
which
my
father
was
born
why
it
is
finer
than
greenock
and
glasgow
which
are
ten
times
as
old
it
is
so
said
my
friend
to
him
and
when
thee
hast
been
here
a
month
thee
will
soon
see
that
it
is
the
capital
of
a
fine
province
of
which
thee
art
going
to
be
a
citizen
greenock
enjoys
neither
such
a
climate
nor
such
a
soil
thus
we
slowly
proceeded
along
when
we
met
several
large
lancaster
waggons
just
arrived
from
the
country
at
this
stupendous
sight
he
stopped
short
and
with
great
diffidence
asked
us
what
was
the
use
of
these
great
moving
houses
and
where
those
big
horses
came
from
have
you
none
such
at
home
i
asked
him
oh
no
these
huge
animals
would
eat
all
the
grass
of
our
island
we
at
last
reached
my
friend
house
who
in
the
glow
of
hospitality
made
them
all
three
sit
down
to
a
good
dinner
and
gave
them
as
much
cider
as
they
could
drink
god
bless
this
country
and
the
good
people
it
contains
said
he
this
is
the
best
victuals
i
have
made
a
long
i
thank
you
kindly
what
part
of
scotland
dost
thee
come
from
friend
andrew
said
some
of
us
come
from
the
main
some
from
the
island
of
barra
he
answered
i
myself
am
a
barra
man
i
looked
on
the
map
and
by
its
latitude
easily
guessed
that
it
must
be
an
inhospitable
climate
what
sort
of
land
have
you
got
there
i
asked
him
bad
enough
said
he
we
have
no
such
trees
as
i
see
here
no
wheat
no
kine
no
apples
then
i
observed
that
it
must
be
hard
for
the
poor
to
live
we
have
no
poor
he
answered
we
are
all
alike
except
our
laird
but
he
can
not
help
everybody
pray
what
is
the
name
of
your
laird
neiel
said
andrew
the
like
of
him
is
not
to
be
found
in
any
of
the
isles
his
forefathers
have
lived
there
thirty
generations
ago
as
we
are
told
now
gentlemen
you
may
judge
what
an
ancient
family
estate
it
must
be
but
it
is
cold
the
land
is
thin
and
there
were
too
many
of
us
which
are
the
reasons
that
some
are
come
to
seek
their
fortunes
here
well
andrew
what
step
do
you
intend
to
take
in
order
to
become
rich
i
do
not
know
sir
i
am
but
an
ignorant
man
a
stranger
besides
i
must
rely
on
the
advice
of
good
christians
they
would
not
deceive
me
i
am
sure
i
have
brought
with
me
a
character
from
our
barra
minister
can
it
do
me
any
good
here
oh
yes
but
your
future
success
will
depend
entirely
on
your
own
conduct
if
you
are
a
sober
man
as
the
certificate
says
laborious
and
honest
there
is
no
fear
but
that
you
will
do
well
have
you
brought
any
money
with
you
andrew
yes
sir
eleven
guineas
and
an
half
upon
my
word
it
is
a
considerable
sum
for
a
barra
man
how
came
you
by
so
much
money
why
seven
years
ago
i
received
a
legacy
of
pounds
from
an
uncle
who
loved
me
much
my
wife
brought
me
two
guineas
when
the
laird
gave
her
to
me
for
a
wife
which
i
have
saved
ever
since
i
have
sold
all
i
had
i
worked
in
glasgow
for
some
time
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
are
so
saving
and
prudent
be
so
still
you
must
go
and
hire
yourself
with
some
good
people
what
can
you
do
i
can
thresh
a
little
and
handle
the
spade
can
you
plough
yes
sir
with
the
little
breast
plough
i
have
brought
with
me
these
wo
do
here
andrew
you
are
an
able
man
if
you
are
willing
you
will
soon
learn
i
tell
you
what
i
intend
to
do
i
send
you
to
my
house
where
you
shall
stay
two
or
three
weeks
there
you
must
exercise
yourself
with
the
axe
that
is
the
principal
tool
the
americans
want
and
particularly
the
settlers
can
your
wife
spin
yes
she
can
well
then
as
soon
as
you
are
able
to
handle
the
axe
you
shall
go
and
live
with
a
particular
friend
of
mine
who
will
give
you
four
dollars
per
month
for
the
first
six
and
the
usual
price
of
five
as
long
as
you
remain
with
him
i
shall
place
your
wife
in
another
house
where
she
shall
receive
half
a
dollar
a
week
for
spinning
and
your
son
a
dollar
a
month
to
drive
the
team
you
shall
have
besides
good
victuals
to
eat
and
good
beds
to
lie
on
will
all
this
satisfy
you
andrew
he
hardly
understood
what
i
said
the
honest
tears
of
gratitude
fell
from
his
eyes
as
he
looked
at
me
and
its
expressions
seemed
to
quiver
on
his
though
silent
this
was
saying
a
great
deal
there
was
besides
something
extremely
moving
to
see
a
man
six
feet
high
thus
shed
tears
and
they
did
not
lessen
the
good
opinion
i
had
entertained
of
him
at
last
he
told
me
that
my
offers
were
more
than
he
deserved
and
that
he
would
first
begin
to
work
for
his
victuals
no
no
said
i
if
you
are
careful
and
sober
and
do
what
you
can
you
shall
receive
what
i
told
you
after
you
have
served
a
short
apprenticeship
at
my
house
may
god
repay
you
for
all
your
kindnesses
said
andrew
as
long
as
i
live
i
shall
thank
you
and
do
what
i
can
for
you
a
few
days
after
i
sent
them
all
three
to
by
the
return
of
some
waggons
that
he
might
have
an
opportunity
of
viewing
and
convincing
himself
of
the
utility
of
those
machines
which
he
had
at
first
so
much
admired
the
further
descriptions
he
gave
us
of
the
hebrides
in
general
and
of
his
native
island
in
particular
of
the
customs
and
modes
of
living
of
the
inhabitants
greatly
entertained
me
pray
is
the
sterility
of
the
soil
the
cause
that
there
are
no
trees
or
is
it
because
there
are
none
planted
what
are
the
modern
families
of
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
compared
to
the
date
of
that
of
neiel
admitting
that
each
generation
should
last
but
forty
years
this
makes
a
period
of
an
extraordinary
duration
for
the
uninterrupted
descent
of
any
family
agreeably
to
the
description
he
gave
us
of
those
countries
they
seem
to
live
according
to
the
rules
of
nature
which
gives
them
but
bare
subsistence
their
constitutions
are
uncontaminated
by
any
excess
or
effeminacy
which
their
soil
refuses
if
their
allowance
of
food
is
not
too
scanty
they
must
all
be
healthy
by
perpetual
temperance
and
exercise
if
so
they
are
amply
rewarded
for
their
poverty
could
they
have
obtained
but
necessary
food
they
would
not
have
left
it
for
it
was
not
in
consequence
of
oppression
either
from
their
patriarch
or
the
government
that
they
had
emigrated
i
wish
we
had
a
colony
of
these
honest
people
settled
in
some
parts
of
this
province
their
morals
their
religion
seem
to
be
as
simple
as
their
manners
this
society
would
present
an
interesting
spectacle
could
they
be
transported
on
a
richer
soil
but
perhaps
that
soil
would
soon
alter
everything
for
our
opinions
vices
and
virtues
are
altogether
local
we
are
machines
fashioned
by
every
circumstance
around
us
andrew
arrived
at
my
house
a
week
before
i
did
and
i
found
my
wife
agreeable
to
my
instructions
had
placed
the
axe
in
his
hands
as
his
first
task
for
some
time
he
was
very
awkward
but
he
was
so
docile
so
willing
and
grateful
as
well
as
his
wife
that
i
foresaw
he
would
succeed
agreeably
to
my
promise
i
put
them
all
with
different
families
where
they
were
well
liked
and
all
parties
were
pleased
andrew
worked
hard
lived
well
grew
fat
and
every
sunday
came
to
pay
me
a
visit
on
a
good
horse
which
lent
him
poor
man
it
took
him
a
long
time
ere
he
could
sit
on
the
saddle
and
hold
the
bridle
properly
i
believe
he
had
never
before
mounted
such
a
beast
though
i
did
not
choose
to
ask
him
that
question
for
fear
it
might
suggest
some
mortifying
ideas
after
having
been
twelve
months
at
and
having
received
his
own
and
his
family
wages
which
amounted
to
dollars
he
came
to
see
me
on
a
and
told
me
that
he
was
a
man
of
middle
age
and
would
willingly
have
land
of
his
own
in
order
to
procure
him
a
home
as
a
shelter
against
old
age
that
whenever
this
period
should
come
his
son
to
whom
he
would
give
his
land
would
then
maintain
him
and
thus
live
altogether
he
therefore
required
my
advice
and
assistance
i
thought
his
desire
very
natural
and
praiseworthy
and
told
him
that
i
should
think
of
it
but
that
he
must
remain
one
month
longer
with
who
had
rails
to
split
he
immediately
consented
the
spring
was
not
far
advanced
enough
yet
for
andrew
to
begin
clearing
any
land
even
supposing
that
he
had
made
a
purchase
as
it
is
always
necessary
that
the
leaves
should
be
out
in
order
that
this
additional
combustible
may
serve
to
burn
the
heaps
of
brush
more
readily
a
few
days
after
it
happened
that
the
whole
family
of
went
to
meeting
and
left
andrew
to
take
care
of
the
house
while
he
was
at
the
door
attentively
reading
the
bible
nine
indians
just
come
from
the
mountains
suddenly
made
their
appearance
and
unloaded
their
packs
of
furs
on
the
floor
of
the
piazza
conceive
if
you
can
what
was
andrew
consternation
at
this
extraordinary
sight
from
the
singular
appearance
of
these
people
the
honest
hebridean
took
them
for
a
lawless
band
come
to
rob
his
house
he
therefore
like
a
faithful
guardian
precipitately
withdrew
and
shut
the
doors
but
as
most
of
our
houses
are
without
locks
he
was
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
fixing
his
knife
over
the
latch
and
then
flew
upstairs
in
quest
of
a
broadsword
he
had
brought
from
scotland
the
indians
who
were
particular
friends
guessed
at
his
suspicions
and
fears
they
forcibly
lifted
the
door
and
suddenly
took
possession
of
the
house
got
all
the
bread
and
meat
they
wanted
and
sat
themselves
down
by
the
fire
at
this
instant
andrew
with
his
broadsword
in
his
hand
entered
the
room
the
indians
earnestly
looking
at
him
and
attentively
watching
his
motions
after
a
very
few
reflections
andrew
found
that
his
weapon
was
useless
when
opposed
to
nine
tomahawks
but
this
did
not
diminish
his
anger
on
the
contrary
it
grew
greater
on
observing
the
calm
impudence
with
which
they
were
devouring
the
family
provisions
unable
to
resist
he
called
them
names
in
broad
scotch
and
ordered
them
to
desist
and
be
gone
to
which
the
indians
as
they
told
me
afterwards
replied
in
their
equally
broad
idiom
it
must
have
been
a
most
unintelligible
altercation
between
this
honest
barra
man
and
nine
indians
who
did
not
much
care
for
anything
he
could
say
at
last
he
ventured
to
lay
his
hands
on
one
of
them
in
order
to
turn
him
out
of
the
house
here
andrew
fidelity
got
the
better
of
his
prudence
for
the
indian
by
his
motions
threatened
to
scalp
him
while
the
rest
gave
the
war
hoop
this
horrid
noise
so
effectually
frightened
poor
andrew
that
unmindful
of
his
courage
of
his
broadsword
and
his
intentions
he
rushed
out
left
them
masters
of
the
house
and
disappeared
i
have
heard
one
of
the
indians
say
since
that
he
never
laughed
so
heartily
in
his
life
andrew
at
a
distance
soon
recovered
from
the
fears
which
had
been
inspired
by
this
infernal
yell
and
thought
of
no
other
remedy
than
to
go
to
the
which
was
about
two
miles
distant
in
the
eagerness
of
his
honest
intentions
with
looks
of
affright
still
marked
on
his
countenance
he
called
out
and
told
him
with
great
vehemence
of
style
that
nine
monsters
were
come
to
his
house
some
blue
some
red
and
some
black
that
they
had
little
axes
in
their
hands
out
of
which
they
smoked
and
that
like
highlanders
they
had
no
breeches
that
they
were
devouring
all
his
victuals
and
that
god
only
knew
what
they
would
do
more
pacify
yourself
said
my
house
is
as
safe
with
these
people
as
if
i
was
there
myself
as
for
the
victuals
they
are
heartily
welcome
honest
andrew
they
are
not
people
of
much
ceremony
they
help
themselves
thus
whenever
they
are
among
their
friends
i
do
so
too
in
their
wigwams
whenever
i
go
to
their
village
you
had
better
therefore
step
in
and
hear
the
remainder
of
the
sermon
and
when
the
meeting
is
over
we
will
all
go
back
in
the
waggon
together
at
their
return
who
speaks
the
indian
language
very
well
explained
the
whole
matter
the
indians
renewed
their
laugh
and
shook
hands
with
honest
andrew
whom
they
made
to
smoke
out
of
their
pipes
and
thus
peace
was
made
and
ratified
according
to
the
indian
custom
by
the
calumet
soon
after
this
adventure
the
time
approached
when
i
had
promised
andrew
my
best
assistance
to
settle
him
for
that
purpose
i
went
to
in
the
county
of
who
i
was
informed
had
purchased
a
tract
of
land
contiguous
to
settlement
i
gave
him
a
faithful
detail
of
the
progress
andrew
had
made
in
the
rural
arts
of
his
honesty
sobriety
and
gratitude
and
pressed
him
to
sell
him
an
hundred
acres
this
i
can
not
comply
with
said
but
at
the
same
time
i
will
do
better
i
love
to
encourage
honest
europeans
as
much
as
you
do
and
to
see
them
prosper
you
tell
me
he
has
but
one
son
i
will
lease
them
an
hundred
acres
for
any
term
of
years
you
please
and
make
it
more
valuable
to
your
scotchman
than
if
he
was
possessed
of
the
fee
simple
by
that
means
he
may
with
what
little
money
he
has
buy
a
plough
a
team
and
some
stock
he
will
not
be
incumbered
with
debts
and
mortgages
what
he
raises
will
be
his
own
had
he
two
or
three
sons
as
able
as
himself
then
i
should
think
it
more
eligible
for
him
to
purchase
the
fee
simple
i
join
with
you
in
opinion
and
will
bring
andrew
along
with
me
in
a
few
days
well
honest
andrew
said
in
consideration
of
your
good
name
i
will
let
you
have
an
hundred
acres
of
good
arable
land
that
shall
be
laid
out
along
a
new
road
there
is
a
bridge
already
erected
on
the
creek
that
passes
through
the
land
and
a
fine
swamp
of
about
twenty
acres
these
are
my
terms
i
can
not
sell
but
i
will
lease
you
the
quantity
that
james
your
friend
has
asked
the
first
seven
years
you
shall
pay
no
rent
whatever
you
sow
and
reap
and
plant
and
gather
shall
be
entirely
your
own
neither
the
king
government
nor
church
will
have
any
claim
on
your
future
property
the
remaining
part
of
the
time
you
must
give
me
twelve
dollars
and
an
half
a
year
and
that
is
all
you
will
have
to
pay
me
within
the
three
first
years
you
must
plant
fifty
apple
trees
and
clear
seven
acres
of
swamp
within
the
first
part
of
the
lease
it
will
be
your
own
advantage
whatever
you
do
more
within
that
time
i
will
pay
you
for
it
at
the
common
rate
of
the
country
the
term
of
the
lease
shall
be
thirty
years
how
do
you
like
it
andrew
oh
sir
it
is
very
good
but
i
am
afraid
that
the
king
or
his
ministers
or
the
governor
or
some
of
our
great
men
will
come
and
take
the
land
from
me
your
son
may
say
to
me
by
and
by
this
is
my
father
land
andrew
you
must
quit
it
no
no
said
there
is
no
such
danger
the
king
and
his
ministers
are
too
just
to
take
the
labour
of
a
poor
settler
here
we
have
no
great
men
but
what
are
subordinate
to
our
laws
but
to
calm
all
your
fears
i
will
give
you
a
lease
so
that
none
can
make
you
afraid
if
ever
you
are
dissatisfied
with
the
land
a
jury
of
your
own
neighbourhood
shall
value
all
your
improvements
and
you
shall
be
paid
agreeably
to
their
verdict
you
may
sell
the
lease
or
if
you
die
you
may
previously
dispose
of
it
as
if
the
land
was
your
own
expressive
yet
inarticulate
joy
was
mixed
in
his
countenance
which
seemed
impressed
with
astonishment
and
confusion
do
you
understand
me
well
said
no
sir
replied
andrew
i
know
nothing
of
what
you
mean
about
lease
improvement
will
jury
etc
that
is
honest
we
will
explain
these
things
to
you
by
and
by
it
must
be
confessed
that
those
were
hard
words
which
he
had
never
heard
in
his
life
for
by
his
own
account
the
ideas
they
convey
would
be
totally
useless
in
the
island
of
barra
no
wonder
therefore
that
he
was
embarrassed
for
how
could
the
man
who
had
hardly
a
will
of
his
own
since
he
was
born
imagine
he
could
have
one
after
his
death
how
could
the
person
who
never
possessed
anything
conceive
that
he
could
extend
his
new
dominion
over
this
land
even
after
he
should
be
laid
in
his
grave
for
my
part
i
think
andrew
amazement
did
not
imply
any
extraordinary
degree
of
ignorance
he
was
an
actor
introduced
upon
a
new
scene
it
required
some
time
ere
he
could
reconcile
himself
to
the
part
he
was
to
perform
however
he
was
soon
enlightened
and
introduced
into
those
mysteries
with
which
we
native
americans
are
but
too
well
acquainted
here
then
is
honest
andrew
invested
with
every
municipal
advantage
they
confer
become
a
freeholder
possessed
of
a
vote
of
a
place
of
residence
a
citizen
of
the
province
of
pennsylvania
original
hopes
and
the
distant
prospects
he
had
formed
in
the
island
of
barra
were
at
the
eve
of
being
realised
we
therefore
can
easily
forgive
him
a
few
spontaneous
ejaculations
which
would
be
useless
to
repeat
this
short
tale
is
easily
told
few
words
are
sufficient
to
describe
this
sudden
change
of
situation
but
in
his
mind
it
was
gradual
and
took
him
above
a
week
before
he
could
be
sure
that
without
disturbing
any
money
he
could
possess
lands
soon
after
he
prepared
himself
i
lent
him
a
barrel
of
pork
and
lb
weight
of
meal
and
made
him
purchase
what
was
necessary
besides
he
set
out
and
hired
a
room
in
the
house
of
a
settler
who
lived
the
most
contiguous
to
his
own
land
his
first
work
was
to
clear
some
acres
of
swamp
that
he
might
have
a
supply
of
hay
the
following
year
for
his
two
horses
and
cows
from
the
first
day
he
began
to
work
he
was
indefatigable
his
honesty
procured
him
friends
and
his
industry
the
esteem
of
his
new
neighbours
one
of
them
offered
him
two
acres
of
cleared
land
whereon
he
might
plant
corn
pumpkins
squashes
and
a
few
potatoes
that
very
season
it
is
astonishing
how
quick
men
will
learn
when
they
work
for
themselves
i
saw
with
pleasure
two
months
after
andrew
holding
a
plough
and
tracing
his
furrows
quite
straight
thus
the
spade
man
of
the
island
of
barra
was
become
the
tiller
of
american
soil
well
done
said
i
andrew
well
done
i
see
that
god
speeds
and
directs
your
works
i
see
prosperity
delineated
in
all
your
furrows
and
head
lands
raise
this
crop
of
corn
with
attention
and
care
and
then
you
will
be
master
of
the
art
as
he
had
neither
mowing
nor
reaping
to
do
that
year
i
told
him
that
the
time
was
come
to
build
his
house
and
that
for
the
purpose
i
would
myself
invite
the
neighbourhood
to
a
frolic
that
thus
he
would
have
a
large
dwelling
erected
and
some
upland
cleared
in
one
day
his
old
friend
came
at
the
time
appointed
with
all
his
hands
and
brought
victuals
in
plenty
i
did
the
same
about
forty
people
repaired
to
the
spot
the
songs
and
merry
stories
went
round
the
woods
from
cluster
to
cluster
as
the
people
had
gathered
to
their
different
works
trees
fell
on
all
sides
bushes
were
cut
up
and
heaped
and
while
many
were
thus
employed
others
with
their
teams
hauled
the
big
logs
to
the
spot
which
andrew
had
pitched
upon
for
the
erection
of
his
new
dwelling
we
all
dined
in
the
woods
in
the
afternoon
the
logs
were
placed
with
skids
and
the
usual
contrivances
thus
the
rude
house
was
raised
and
above
two
acres
of
land
cut
up
cleared
and
heaped
whilst
all
these
different
operations
were
performing
andrew
was
absolutely
incapable
of
working
it
was
to
him
the
most
solemn
holiday
he
had
ever
seen
it
would
have
been
sacrilegious
in
him
to
have
denied
it
with
menial
labour
poor
man
he
sanctified
it
with
joy
and
thanksgiving
and
honest
libations
he
went
from
one
to
the
other
with
the
bottle
in
his
hand
pressing
everybody
to
drink
and
drinking
himself
to
show
the
example
he
spent
the
whole
day
in
smiling
laughing
and
uttering
monosyllables
his
wife
and
son
were
there
also
but
as
they
could
not
understand
the
language
their
pleasure
must
have
been
altogether
that
of
the
imagination
the
powerful
lord
the
wealthy
merchant
on
seeing
the
superb
mansion
finished
never
can
feel
half
the
joy
and
real
happiness
which
was
felt
and
enjoyed
on
that
day
by
this
honest
hebridean
though
this
new
dwelling
erected
in
the
midst
of
the
woods
was
nothing
more
than
a
square
inclosure
composed
of
large
clumsy
logs
let
in
at
the
ends
when
the
work
was
finished
the
company
made
the
woods
resound
with
the
noise
of
their
three
cheers
and
the
honest
wishes
they
formed
for
andrew
prosperity
he
could
say
nothing
but
with
thankful
tears
he
shook
hands
with
them
all
thus
from
the
first
day
he
had
landed
andrew
marched
towards
this
important
event
this
memorable
day
made
the
sun
shine
on
that
land
on
which
he
was
to
sow
wheat
and
other

what
swamp
he
had
cleared
lay
before
his
door
the
essence
of
future
bread
milk
and
meat
were
scattered
all
round
him
soon
after
he
hired
a
carpenter
who
put
on
a
roof
and
laid
the
floors
in
a
week
more
the
house
was
properly
plastered
and
the
chimney
finished
he
moved
into
it
and
purchased
two
cows
which
found
plenty
of
food
in
the
woods
his
hogs
had
the
same
advantage
that
very
year
he
and
his
son
sowed
three
bushels
of
wheat
from
which
he
reaped
and
a
half
for
i
had
ordered
him
to
keep
an
exact
account
of
all
he
should
raise
his
first
crop
of
other
corn
would
have
been
as
good
had
it
not
been
for
the
squirrels
which
were
enemies
not
to
be
dispersed
by
the
broadsword
the
fourth
year
i
took
an
inventory
of
the
wheat
this
man
possessed

i
send
you
soon
after
further
settlements
were
made
on
that
road
and
andrew
instead
of
being
the
last
man
towards
the
wilderness
found
himself
in
a
few
years
in
the
middle
of
a
numerous
society
he
helped
others
as
generously
as
others
had
helped
him
and
i
have
dined
many
times
at
his
table
with
several
of
his
neighbours
the
second
year
he
was
made
overseer
of

served
on
two
petty

performing
as
a
citizen

the
duties
required
of
him

his

victorious

the
end
of

with
one
half
of
the
pleasure
with
which
i
have
conducted
andrew
to
the
situation
he
now
enjoys
he
is
independent

honours
do
not
always
imply
those
two
blessings
he
is
unencumbered
with
debts

any

the
successes
of
a

of

makes
every
cool
reflecting

of

the
greatest
compliment
that
can
be
paid
to
the
best
of
kings
to
the
wisest
ministers
or
the
most
patriotic
rulers
is
to
think
that
the
reformation
of
political
abuses
and
the
happiness
of
their
people
are
the
primary
objects
of
their
attention
but
alas
how
disagreeable
must
the
work
of
reformation
be
how
dreaded
the
operation
for
we
hear
of
no
amendment
on
the
contrary
the
great
number
of
european
emigrants
yearly
coming
over
here
informs
us
that
the
severity
of
taxes
the
injustice
of
laws
the
tyranny
of
the
rich
and
the
oppressive
avarice
of
the
church
are
as
intolerable
as
ever
will
these
calamities
have
no
end
are
not
the
great
rulers
of
the
earth
afraid
of
losing
by
degrees
their
most
useful
subjects
this
country
providentially
intended
for
the
general
asylum
of
the
world
will
flourish
by
the
oppression
of
their
people
they
will
every
day
become
better
acquainted
with
the
happiness
we
enjoy
and
seek
for
the
means
of
transporting
themselves
here
in
spite
of
all
obstacles
and
laws
to
what
purpose
then
have
so
many
useful
books
and
divine
maxims
been
transmitted
to
us
from
preceding
ages
are
they
all
vain
all
useless
must
human
nature
ever
be
the
sport
of
the
few
and
its
many
wounds
remain
unhealed
how
happy
are
we
here
in
having
fortunately
escaped
the
miseries
which
attended
our
fathers
how
thankful
ought
we
to
be
that
they
reared
us
in
a
land
where
sobriety
and
industry
never
fail
to
meet
with
the
most
ample
rewards
you
have
no
doubt
read
several
histories
of
this
continent
yet
there
are
a
thousand
facts
a
thousand
explanations
overlooked
authors
will
certainly
convey
to
you
a
geographical
knowledge
of
this
country
they
will
acquaint
you
with
the
eras
of
the
several
settlements
the
foundations
of
our
towns
the
spirit
of
our
different
charters
yet
they
do
not
sufficiently
disclose
the
genius
of
the
people
their
various
customs
their
modes
of
agriculture
the
innumerable
resources
which
the
industrious
have
of
raising
themselves
to
a
comfortable
and
easy
situation
few
of
these
writers
have
resided
here
and
those
who
have
had
not
pervaded
every
part
of
the
country
nor
carefully
examined
the
nature
and
principles
of
our
association
it
would
be
a
task
worthy
a
speculative
genius
to
enter
intimately
into
the
situation
and
characters
of
the
people
from
nova
scotia
to
west
florida
and
surely
history
can
not
possibly
present
any
subject
more
pleasing
to
behold
sensible
how
unable
i
am
to
lead
you
through
so
vast
a
maze
let
us
look
attentively
for
some
small
unnoticed
corner
but
where
shall
we
go
in
quest
of
such
a
one
numberless
settlements
each
distinguished
by
some
peculiarities
present
themselves
on
every
side
all
seem
to
realise
the
most
sanguine
wishes
that
a
good
man
could
form
for
the
happiness
of
his
race
here
they
live
by
fishing
on
the
most
plentiful
coasts
in
the
world
there
they
fell
trees
by
the
sides
of
large
rivers
for
masts
and
lumber
here
others
convert
innumerable
logs
into
the
best
boards
there
again
others
cultivate
the
land
rear
cattle
and
clear
large
fields
yet
i
have
a
spot
in
my
view
where
none
of
these
occupations
are
performed
which
will
i
hope
reward
us
for
the
trouble
of
inspection
but
though
it
is
barren
in
its
soil
insignificant
in
its
extent
inconvenient
in
its
situation
deprived
of
materials
for
building
it
seems
to
have
been
inhabited
merely
to
prove
what
mankind
can
do
when
happily
governed
here
i
can
point
out
to
you
exertions
of
the
most
successful
industry
instances
of
native
sagacity
unassisted
by
science
the
happy
fruits
of
a
well
directed
perseverance
it
is
always
a
refreshing
spectacle
to
me
when
in
my
review
of
the
various
component
parts
of
this
immense
whole
i
observe
the
labours
of
its
inhabitants
singularly
rewarded
by
nature
when
i
see
them
emerged
out
of
their
first
difficulties
living
with
decency
and
ease
and
conveying
to
their
posterity
that
plentiful
subsistence
which
their
fathers
have
so
deservedly
earned
but
when
their
prosperity
arises
from
the
goodness
of
the
climate
and
fertility
of
the
soil
i
partake
of
their
happiness
it
is
true
yet
stay
but
a
little
while
with
them
as
they
exhibit
nothing
but
what
is
natural
and
common
on
the
contrary
when
i
meet
with
barren
spots
fertilised
grass
growing
where
none
grew
before
grain
gathered
from
fields
which
had
hitherto
produced
nothing
better
than
brambles
dwellings
raised
where
no
building
materials
were
to
be
found
wealth
acquired
by
the
most
uncommon
means
there
i
pause
to
dwell
on
the
favourite
object
of
my
speculative
inquiries
willingly
do
i
leave
the
former
to
enjoy
the
odoriferous
furrow
or
their
rich
valleys
with
anxiety
repairing
to
the
spot
where
so
many
difficulties
have
been
overcome
where
extraordinary
exertions
have
produced
extraordinary
effects
and
where
every
natural
obstacle
has
been
removed
by
a
vigorous
industry
i
want
not
to
record
the
annals
of
the
island
of
nantucket
its
inhabitants
have
no
annals
for
they
are
not
a
race
of
warriors
my
simple
wish
is
to
trace
them
throughout
their
progressive
steps
from
their
arrival
here
to
this
present
hour
to
inquire
by
what
means
they
have
raised
themselves
from
the
most
humble
the
most
insignificant
beginnings
to
the
ease
and
the
wealth
they
now
possess
and
to
give
you
some
idea
of
their
customs
religion
manners
policy
and
mode
of
living
this
happy
settlement
was
not
founded
on
intrusion
forcible
entries
or
blood
as
so
many
others
have
been
it
drew
its
origin
from
necessity
on
the
one
side
and
from
good
will
on
the
other
and
ever
since
all
has
been
a
scene
of
uninterrupted
neither
political
nor
religious
broils
neither
disputes
with
the
natives
nor
any
other
contentions
have
in
the
least
agitated
or
disturbed
its
detached
society
yet
the
first
founders
knew
nothing
either
of
lycurgus
or
solon
for
this
settlement
has
not
been
the
work
of
eminent
men
or
powerful
legislators
forcing
nature
by
the
accumulated
labours
of
art
this
singular
establishment
has
been
effected
by
means
of
that
native
industry
and
perseverance
common
to
all
men
when
they
are
protected
by
a
government
which
demands
but
little
for
its
protection
when
they
are
permitted
to
enjoy
a
system
of
rational
laws
founded
on
perfect
freedom
the
mildness
and
humanity
of
such
a
government
necessarily
implies
that
confidence
which
is
the
source
of
the
most
arduous
undertakings
and
permanent
success
would
you
believe
that
a
sandy
spot
of
about
thousand
acres
affording
neither
stones
nor
timber
meadows
nor
arable
yet
can
boast
of
an
handsome
town
consisting
of
more
than
houses
should
possess
above
sail
of
vessels
constantly
employ
upwards
of
seamen
feed
more
than
sheep
cows
horses
and
has
several
citizens
worth
pounds
sterling
yet
all
these
facts
are
uncontroverted
who
would
have
imagined
that
any
people
should
have
abandoned
a
fruitful
and
extensive
continent
filled
with
the
riches
which
the
most
ample
vegetation
affords
replete
with
good
soil
enamelled
meadows
rich
pastures
every
kind
of
timber
and
with
all
other
materials
necessary
to
render
life
happy
and
comfortable
to
come
and
inhabit
a
little
sandbank
to
which
nature
had
refused
those
advantages
to
dwell
on
a
spot
where
there
scarcely
grew
a
shrub
to
announce
by
the
budding
of
its
leaves
the
arrival
of
the
spring
and
to
warn
by
their
fall
the
proximity
of
winter
had
this
island
been
contiguous
to
the
shores
of
some
ancient
monarchy
it
would
only
have
been
occupied
by
a
few
wretched
fishermen
who
oppressed
by
poverty
would
hardly
have
been
able
to
purchase
or
build
little
fishing
barks
always
dreading
the
weight
of
taxes
or
the
servitude
of
instead
of
that
boldness
of
speculation
for
which
the
inhabitants
of
this
island
are
so
remarkable
they
would
fearfully
have
confined
themselves
within
the
narrow
limits
of
the
most
trifling
attempts
timid
in
their
excursions
they
never
could
have
extricated
themselves
from
their
first
difficulties
this
island
on
the
contrary
contains
hardy
people
who
boldly
derive
their
riches
from
the
element
that
surrounds
them
and
have
been
compelled
by
the
sterility
of
the
soil
to
seek
abroad
for
the
means
of
subsistence
you
must
not
imagine
from
the
recital
of
these
facts
that
they
enjoyed
any
exclusive
privileges
or
royal
charters
or
that
they
were
nursed
by
particular
immunities
in
the
infancy
of
their
settlement
no
their
freedom
their
skill
their
probity
and
perseverance
have
accomplished
everything
and
brought
them
by
degrees
to
the
rank
they
now
hold
from
this
first
sketch
i
hope
that
my
partiality
to
this
island
will
be
justified
perhaps
you
hardly
know
that
such
an
one
exists
in
the
neighbourhood
of
cape
cod
what
has
happened
here
has
and
will
happen
everywhere
else
give
mankind
the
full
rewards
of
their
industry
allow
them
to
enjoy
the
fruit
of
their
labour
under
the
peaceable
shade
of
their
vines
and
leave
their
native
activity
unshackled
and
free
like
a
fair
stream
without
dams
or
other
obstacles
the
first
will
fertilise
the
very
sand
on
which
they
tread
the
other
exhibit
a
navigable
river
spreading
plenty
and
cheerfulness
wherever
the
declivity
of
the
ground
leads
it
if
these
people
are
not
famous
for
tracing
the
fragrant
furrow
on
the
plain
they
plough
the
rougher
ocean
they
gather
from
its
surface
at
an
immense
distance
and
with
herculean
labours
the
riches
it
affords
they
go
to
hunt
and
catch
that
huge
fish
which
by
its
strength
and
velocity
one
would
imagine
ought
to
be
beyond
the
reach
of
man
this
island
has
nothing
deserving
of
notice
but
its
inhabitants
here
you
meet
with
neither
ancient
monuments
spacious
halls
solemn
temples
nor
elegant
dwellings
not
a
citadel
nor
any
kind
of
fortification
not
even
a
battery
to
rend
the
air
with
its
loud
peals
on
any
solemn
occasion
as
for
their
rural
improvements
they
are
many
but
all
of
the
most
simple
and
useful
kind
the
island
of
nantucket
lies
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
miles
from
cape
cod
from
hyanes
or
barnstable
a
town
on
the
most
contiguous
part
of
the
great
peninsula
miles
by
from
cape
pog
on
the
vineyard
by
from
wood
hole
on
elizabeth
island
miles
from
boston
from
rhode
island
from
bermudas
sherborn
is
the
only
town
on
the
island
which
consists
of
about
houses
that
have
been
framed
on
the
main
they
are
lathed
and
plastered
within
handsomely
painted
and
boarded
without
each
has
a
cellar
underneath
built
with
stones
fetched
also
from
the
main
they
are
all
of
a
similar
construction
and
appearance
plain
and
entirely
devoid
of
exterior
or
interior
ornament
i
observed
but
one
which
was
built
of
bricks
belonging
to
but
like
the
rest
it
is
unadorned
the
town
stands
on
a
rising
sandbank
on
the
west
side
of
the
harbour
which
is
very
safe
from
all
winds
there
are
two
places
of
worship
one
for
the
society
of
friends
the
other
for
that
of
presbyterians
and
in
the
middle
of
the
town
near
the
stands
a
simple
building
which
is
the
county
the
town
regularly
ascends
toward
the
country
and
in
its
vicinage
they
have
several
small
fields
and
gardens
yearly
manured
with
the
dung
of
their
cows
and
the
soil
of
their
streets
there
are
a
good
many
cherry
and
peach
trees
planted
in
their
streets
and
in
many
other
places
the
apple
tree
does
not
thrive
well
they
have
therefore
planted
but
few
the
island
contains
no
mountains
yet
is
very
uneven
and
the
many
rising
grounds
and
eminences
with
which
it
is
filled
have
formed
in
the
several
valleys
a
great
variety
of
swamps
where
the
indian
grass
and
the
blue
bent
peculiar
to
such
soils
grow
with
tolerable
luxuriancy
some
of
the
swamps
abound
with
peat
which
serves
the
poor
instead
of
firewood
there
are
fourteen
ponds
on
this
island
all
extremely
useful
some
lying
transversely
almost
across
it
which
greatly
helps
to
divide
it
into
partitions
for
the
use
of
their
cattle
others
abound
with
peculiar
fish
and
sea
fowls
their
streets
are
not
paved
but
this
is
attended
with
little
inconvenience
as
it
is
never
crowded
with
country
carriages
and
those
they
have
in
the
town
are
seldom
made
use
of
but
in
the
time
of
the
coming
in
and
before
the
sailing
of
their
fleets
at
my
first
landing
i
was
much
surprised
at
the
disagreeable
smell
which
struck
me
in
many
parts
of
the
town
it
is
caused
by
the
whale
oil
and
is
unavoidable
the
neatness
peculiar
to
these
people
can
neither
remove
nor
prevent
it
there
are
near
the
wharfs
a
great
many
storehouses
where
their
staple
commodity
is
deposited
as
well
as
the
innumerable
materials
which
are
always
wanted
to
repair
and
fit
out
so
many
whalemen
they
have
three
docks
each
three
hundred
feet
long
and
extremely
convenient
at
the
head
of
which
there
are
ten
feet
of
water
these
docks
are
built
like
those
in
boston
of
logs
fetched
from
the
continent
filled
with
stones
and
covered
with
sand
between
these
docks
and
the
town
there
is
room
sufficient
for
the
landing
of
goods
and
for
the
passage
of
their
numerous
carts
for
almost
every
man
here
has
one
the
wharfs
to
the
north
and
south
of
the
docks
are
built
of
the
same
materials
and
give
a
stranger
at
his
first
landing
an
high
idea
of
the
prosperity
of
these
people
and
there
is
room
around
these
three
docks
for
sail
of
vessels
when
their
fleets
have
been
successful
the
bustle
and
hurry
of
business
on
this
spot
for
some
days
after
their
arrival
would
make
you
imagine
that
sherborn
is
the
capital
of
a
very
opulent
and
large
province
on
that
point
of
land
which
forms
the
west
side
of
the
harbour
stands
a
very
neat
lighthouse
the
opposite
peninsula
called
coitou
secures
it
from
the
most
dangerous
winds
there
are
but
few
gardens
and
arable
fields
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
town
for
nothing
can
be
more
sterile
and
sandy
than
this
part
of
the
island
they
have
however
with
unwearied
perseverance
by
bringing
a
variety
of
manure
and
by
enriched
several
spots
where
they
raise
indian
corn
potatoes
pumpkins
turnips
etc
on
the
highest
part
of
this
sandy
eminence
four
windmills
grind
the
grain
they
raise
or
import
and
contiguous
to
them
their
rope
walk
is
to
be
seen
where
full
half
of
their
cordage
is
manufactured
between
the
shores
of
the
harbour
the
docks
and
the
town
there
is
a
most
excellent
piece
of
meadow
inclosed
and
manured
with
such
cost
and
pains
as
show
how
necessary
and
precious
grass
is
at
nantucket
towards
the
point
of
shemah
the
island
is
more
level
and
the
soil
better
and
there
they
have
considerable
lots
well
fenced
and
richly
manured
where
they
diligently
raise
their
yearly
crops
there
are
but
very
few
farms
on
this
island
because
there
are
but
very
few
spots
that
will
admit
of
cultivation
without
the
assistance
of
dung
and
other
manure
which
is
very
expensive
to
fetch
from
the
main
this
island
was
patented
in
the
year
by
proprietors
under
the
province
of
new
york
which
then
claimed
all
the
islands
from
the
neway
sink
to
cape
cod
they
found
it
so
universally
barren
and
so
unfit
for
cultivation
that
they
mutually
agreed
not
to
divide
it
as
each
could
neither
live
on
nor
improve
that
lot
which
might
fall
to
his
share
they
then
cast
their
eyes
on
the
sea
and
finding
themselves
obliged
to
become
fishermen
they
looked
for
a
harbour
and
having
found
one
they
determined
to
build
a
town
in
its
neighbourhood
and
to
dwell
together
for
that
purpose
they
surveyed
as
much
ground
as
would
afford
to
each
what
is
generally
called
here
a
home
lot
forty
acres
were
thought
sufficient
to
answer
this
double
purpose
for
to
what
end
should
they
covet
more
land
than
they
could
improve
or
even
inclose
not
being
possessed
of
a
single
tree
in
the
whole
extent
of
their
new
dominion
this
was
all
the
territorial
property
they
allotted
the
rest
they
agreed
to
hold
in
common
and
seeing
that
the
scanty
grass
of
the
island
might
feed
sheep
they
agreed
that
each
proprietor
should
be
entitled
to
feed
on
it
if
he
pleased
sheep
by
this
agreement
the
national
flock
was
to
consist
of
that
is
the
undivided
part
of
the
island
was
by
such
means
ideally
divisible
into
as
many
parts
or
shares
to
which
nevertheless
no
certain
determinate
quantity
of
land
was
affixed
for
they
knew
not
how
much
the
island
contained
nor
could
the
most
judicious
surveyor
fix
this
small
quota
as
to
quality
and
quantity
further
they
agreed
in
case
the
grass
should
grow
better
by
feeding
that
then
four
sheep
should
represent
a
cow
and
two
cows
a
horse
such
was
the
method
this
wise
people
took
to
enjoy
in
common
their
new
settlement
such
was
the
mode
of
their
first
establishment
which
may
be
truly
and
literally
called
a
pastoral
one
several
hundred
of
titles
have
since
been
divided
on
those
different
tracts
which
are
now
cultivated
the
rest
by
inheritance
and
intermarriages
have
been
so
subdivided
that
it
is
very
common
for
a
girl
to
have
no
other
portion
but
her
outset
and
four
sheep
pastures
or
the
privilege
of
feeding
a
cow
but
as
this
privilege
is
founded
on
an
ideal
though
real
title
to
some
unknown
piece
of
land
which
one
day
or
another
may
be
ascertained
these
titles
should
convey
to
your
imagination
something
more
valuable
and
of
greater
credit
than
the
mere
advantage
arising
from
the
benefit
of
a
cow
which
in
that
case
would
be
no
more
than
a
right
of
commonage
whereas
here
as
labour
grows
cheaper
as
misfortunes
from
their
sea
adventures
may
happen
each
person
possessed
of
a
sufficient
number
of
these
titles
may
one
day
realise
them
on
some
peculiar
spot
such
as
shall
be
adjudged
by
the
council
of
the
proprietors
to
be
adequate
to
their
value
and
this
is
the
reason
that
these
people
very
unwillingly
sell
those
small
rights
and
esteem
them
more
than
you
would
imagine
they
are
the
representation
of
a
future
freehold
they
cherish
in
the
mind
of
the
possessor
a
latent
though
distant
hope
that
by
his
success
in
his
next
whale
season
he
may
be
able
to
pitch
on
some
predilected
spot
and
there
build
himself
a
home
to
which
he
may
retire
and
spend
the
latter
end
of
his
days
in
peace
a
council
of
proprietors
always
exists
in
this
island
who
decide
their
territorial
differences
their
titles
are
recorded
in
the
books
of
the
county
which
this
town
represents
as
well
as
every
conveyance
of
lands
and
other
sales
this
island
furnishes
the
naturalist
with
few
or
no
objects
worthy
observation
it
appears
to
be
the
uneven
summit
of
a
sandy
submarine
mountain
covered
here
and
there
with
sorrel
grass
a
few
cedar
bushes
and
scrubby
oaks
their
swamps
are
much
more
valuable
for
the
peat
they
contain
than
for
the
trifling
pasture
of
their
surface
those
declining
grounds
which
lead
to
the
seashores
abound
with
beach
grass
a
light
fodder
when
cut
and
cured
but
very
good
when
fed
green
on
the
east
side
of
the
island
they
have
several
tracts
of
salt
grasses
which
being
carefully
fenced
yield
a
considerable
quantity
of
that
wholesome
fodder
among
the
many
ponds
or
lakes
with
which
this
island
abounds
there
are
some
which
have
been
made
by
the
intrusion
of
the
sea
such
as
wiwidiah
the
long
the
narrow
and
several
others
consequently
those
are
salt
and
the
others
fresh
the
former
answer
two
considerable
purposes
first
by
enabling
them
to
fence
the
island
with
greater
facility
at
peculiar
high
tides
a
great
number
of
fish
enter
into
them
where
they
feed
and
grow
large
and
at
some
known
seasons
of
the
year
the
inhabitants
assemble
and
cut
down
the
small
bars
which
the
waves
always
throw
up
by
these
easy
means
the
waters
of
the
pond
are
let
out
and
as
the
fish
follow
their
native
element
the
inhabitants
with
proper
nets
catch
as
many
as
they
want
in
their
way
out
without
any
other
trouble
those
which
are
most
common
are
the
streaked
bass
the
blue
fish
the
the
mackerel
the
tag
the
herring
the
flounder
eel
etc
fishing
is
one
of
the
greatest
diversions
the
island
affords
at
the
west
end
lies
the
harbour
of
mardiket
formed
by
smith
point
on
the
by
eel
point
on
the
north
and
tuckanut
island
on
the
but
it
is
neither
so
safe
nor
has
it
so
good
anchoring
ground
as
that
near
which
the
town
stands
three
small
creeks
run
into
it
which
yield
the
bitterest
eels
i
have
ever
tasted
between
the
lots
of
palpus
on
the
east
barry
valley
and
miacomet
pond
on
the
south
and
the
narrow
pond
on
the
west
not
far
from
shemah
point
they
have
a
considerable
tract
of
even
ground
being
the
least
sandy
and
the
best
on
the
island
it
is
divided
into
seven
fields
one
of
which
is
planted
by
that
part
of
the
community
which
are
entitled
to
it
this
is
called
the
common
plantation
a
simple
but
useful
expedient
for
was
each
holder
of
this
track
to
fence
his
property
it
would
require
a
prodigious
quantity
of
posts
and
rails
which
you
must
remember
are
to
be
purchased
and
fetched
from
the
main
instead
of
those
private
subdivisions
each
man
allotment
of
land
is
thrown
into
the
general
field
which
is
fenced
at
the
expense
of
the
parties
within
it
every
one
does
with
his
own
portion
of
the
ground
whatever
he
pleases
this
apparent
community
saves
a
very
material
expense
a
great
deal
of
labour
and
perhaps
raises
a
sort
of
emulation
among
them
which
urges
every
one
to
fertilise
his
share
with
the
greatest
care
and
attention
thus
every
seven
years
the
whole
of
this
tract
is
under
cultivation
and
enriched
by
manure
and
ploughing
yields
afterwards
excellent
pasture
to
which
the
town
cows
amounting
to
are
daily
led
by
the
town
shepherd
and
as
regularly
drove
back
in
the
evening
there
each
animal
easily
finds
the
house
to
which
it
belongs
where
they
are
sure
to
be
well
rewarded
for
the
milk
they
give
by
a
present
of
bran
grain
or
some
farinaceous
preparation
their
economy
being
very
great
in
that
respect
these
are
commonly
called
tetoukemah
lots
you
must
not
imagine
that
every
person
on
the
island
is
either
a
landholder
or
concerned
in
rural
operations
no
the
greater
part
are
at
sea
busily
employed
in
their
different
fisheries
others
are
mere
strangers
who
come
to
settle
as
handicrafts
mechanics
and
even
among
the
natives
few
are
possessed
of
determinate
shares
of
land
for
engaged
in
sea
affairs
or
trade
they
are
satisfied
with
possessing
a
few
sheep
pastures
by
means
of
which
they
may
have
perhaps
one
or
two
cows
many
have
but
one
for
the
great
number
of
children
they
have
has
caused
such
of
the
original
proprietorship
as
is
sometimes
puzzling
to
trace
and
several
of
the
most
fortunate
at
sea
have
purchased
and
realised
a
great
number
of
these
original
pasture
titles
the
best
land
on
the
island
is
at
palpus
remarkable
for
nothing
but
a
house
of
entertainment
quayes
is
a
small
but
valuable
track
long
since
purchased
by
coffin
where
he
has
erected
the
best
house
on
the
island
by
long
attention
proximity
of
the
sea
this
fertile
spot
has
been
well
manured
and
is
now
the
garden
of
nantucket
adjoining
to
it
on
the
west
side
there
is
a
small
stream
on
which
they
have
erected
a
fulling
mill
on
the
east
is
the
lot
known
by
the
name
of
squam
watered
likewise
by
a
small
rivulet
on
which
stands
another
fulling
mill
here
is
fine
loamy
soil
producing
excellent
clover
which
is
mowed
twice
a
year
these
mills
prepare
all
the
cloth
which
is
made
here
you
may
easily
suppose
that
having
so
large
a
flock
of
sheep
they
abound
in
wool
part
of
this
they
export
and
the
rest
is
spun

abounding

it

they
catch
their
best
fish
such
as

black

cod
smelt
perch

they
have
erected
a

well
as
at

the

many
red

at

is
a
long
point
of
land
projecting
far
into
the
sea
called
sandy
point
nothing
grows
on
it
but
plain
grass
and
this
is
the
place
from
whence
they
often
catch
porpoises
and
sharks
by
a
very
ingenious
method
on
this
point
they
commonly
drive
their
horses
in
the
spring
of
the
year
in
order
to
feed
on
the
grass
it
bears
which
is
useless
when
arrived
at
maturity
between
that
point

they
have
a
valuable
salt

famous
for
black

hence
we
must
return
to

those
who
possess
it

no

therefore
neglect

the
tyrant

after
having
escaped
from

free
from

its
short
passage
blows
with
redoubled
force
and
renders
this

bleak

uncomfortable
on
the
other
hand
the
goodness
of
their

the
social
hospitality
of
their

good
cheer
make
them
ample
amends
for
the
severity
of

are
the

so
deep
as
on
the
main
the
necessary
and
unavoidable
inactivity
of
that

combined
with
the

of

force
mankind
to
suspend
their

often
at
this
season
more
than
half
the
inhabitants
of
the
island
are
at

fishing
in

latitudes
this
island
as
has
been
already
hinted
appears
to
be
the
summit
of
some
huge
sandy
mountain
affording
some
acres
of
dry
land
for
the
habitation
of
man
other
submarine
ones
lie
to
the
southward
of
this
at
different
depths
and
different
distances
this
dangerous
region
is
well
known
to
the
mariners
by
the
name
of
nantucket
shoals
these
are
the
bulwarks
which
so
powerfully
defend
this
island
from
the
impulse
of
the
mighty
ocean
and
repel
the
force
of
its
waves
which
but
for
the
accumulated
barriers
would
ere
now
have
dissolved
its
foundations
and
torn
it
in
pieces
these
are
the
banks
which
afforded
to
the
first
inhabitants
of
nantucket
their
daily
subsistence
as
it
was
from
these
shoals
that
they
drew
the
origin
of
that
wealth
which
they
now
possess
and
was
the
school
where
they
first
learned
how
to
venture
farther
as
the
fish
of
their
coast
receded
the
shores
of
this
island
abound
with
the
shelled
the
and
the
great
sea
clams
a
most
nutritious
their
sands
their
shallows
are
covered
with
them
they
multiply
so
fast
that
they
are
a
resource
these
and
the
great
variety
of
fish
they
catch
constitute
the
principal
food
of
the
inhabitants
it
was
likewise
that
of
the
aborigines
whom
the
first
settlers
found
here
the
posterity
of
whom
still
live
together
in
decent
houses
along
the
shores
of
miacomet
pond
on
the
south
side
of
the
island
they
are
an
industrious
harmless
race
as
expert
and
as
fond
of
a
seafaring
life
as
their
fellow
inhabitants
the
whites
long
before
their
arrival
they
had
been
engaged
in
petty
wars
against
one
another
the
latter
brought
them
peace
for
it
was
in
quest
of
peace
that
they
abandoned
the
main
this
island
was
then
supposed
to
be
under
the
jurisdiction
of
new
york
as
well
as
the
islands
of
the
vineyard
elizabeth
but
have
been
since
adjudged
to
be
a
part
of
the
province
of
massachusetts
bay
this
change
of
jurisdiction
procured
them
that
peace
they
wanted
and
which
their
brethren
had
so
long
refused
them
in
the
days
of
their
religious
frenzy
thus
have
enthusiasm
and
persecution
both
in
europe
as
well
as
here
been
the
cause
of
the
most
arduous
undertakings
and
the
means
of
those
rapid
settlements
which
have
been
made
along
these
extended
this
island
having
been
since
incorporated
with
the
neighbouring
province
is
become
one
of
its
counties
known
by
the
name
of
nantucket
as
well
as
the
island
of
the
vineyard
by
that
of
county
they
enjoy
here
the
same
municipal
establishment
in
common
with
the
rest
and
therefore
every
requisite
officer
such
as
sheriff
justice
of
the
peace
supervisors
assessors
constables
overseer
of
the
poor
etc
their
taxes
are
proportioned
to
those
of
the
metropolis
they
are
levied
as
with
us
by
valuations
agreed
on
and
fixed
according
to
the
laws
of
the
province
and
by
assessments
formed
by
the
assessors
who
are
yearly
chosen
by
the
people
and
whose
office
obliges
them
to
take
either
an
oath
or
an
affirmation
two
thirds
of
the
magistrates
they
have
here
are
of
the
society
of
friends
before
i
enter
into
the
further
detail
of
this
people
government
industry
mode
of
living
i
think
it
accessary
to
give
you
a
short
sketch
of
the
political
state
the
natives
had
been
in
a
few
years
preceding
the
arrival
of
the
whites
among
them
they
are
hastening
towards
a
total
annihilation
and
this
may
be
perhaps
the
last
compliment
that
will
ever
be
paid
them
by
any
traveller
they
were
not
extirpated
by
fraud
violence
or
injustice
as
hath
been
the
case
in
so
many
provinces
on
the
contrary
they
have
been
treated
by
these
people
as
brethren
the
peculiar
genius
of
their
sect
inspiring
them
with
the
same
spirit
of
moderation
which
was
exhibited
at
pennsylvania
before
the
arrival
of
the
europeans
they
lived
on
the
fish
of
their
shores
and
it
was
from
the
same
resources
the
first
settlers
were
compelled
to
draw
their
first
subsistence
it
is
uncertain
whether
the
original
right
of
the
earl
of
sterling
or
that
of
the
duke
of
york
was
founded
on
a
fair
purchase
of
the
soil
or
not
whatever
injustice
might
have
been
committed
in
that
respect
can
not
be
charged
to
the
account
of
those
friends
who
purchased
from
others
who
no
doubt
founded
their
right
on
indian
grants
and
if
their
numbers
are
now
so
decreased
it
must
not
be
attributed
either
to
tyranny
or
violence
but
to
some
of
those
causes
which
have
uninterruptedly
produced
the
same
effects
from
one
end
of
the
continent
to
the
other
wherever
both
nations
have
been
mixed
this
insignificant
spot
like
the
of
the
great
peninsula
was
filled
with
these
people
the
great
plenty
of
clams
oysters
and
other
fish
on
which
they
lived
and
which
they
easily
catched
had
prodigiously
increased
their
numbers
history
does
not
inform
us
what
particular
nation
the
aborigines
of
nantucket
were
of
it
is
however
very
probable
that
they
anciently
emigrated
from
the
opposite
coast
perhaps
from
the
hyannees
which
is
but
miles
distant
as
they
then
spoke
and
still
speak
the
nattick
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
they
must
have
had
some
affinity
with
that
nation
or
else
that
the
nattick
like
the
huron
in
the
parts
of
this
continent
must
have
been
the
most
prevailing
one
in
this
region
elliot
an
eminent
new
england
divine
and
one
of
the
first
founders
of
that
great
colony
translated
the
bible
into
this
language
in
the
year
which
was
printed
soon
after
at
cambridge
near
boston
he
translated
also
the
catechism
and
many
other
useful
books
which
are
still
very
common
on
this
island
and
are
daily
made
use
of
by
those
indians
who
are
taught
to
read
the
young
europeans
learn
it
with
the
same
facility
as
their
own
tongues
and
ever
after
speak
it
both
with
ease
and
fluency
whether
the
present
indians
are
the
decendants
of
the
ancient
natives
of
the
island
or
whether
they
are
the
remains
of
the
many
different
nations
which
once
inhabited
the
regions
of
mashpe
and
nobscusset
in
the
peninsula
now
known
by
the
name
of
cape
cod
no
one
can
positively
tell
not
even
themselves
the
last
opinion
seems
to
be
that
of
the
most
sensible
people
of
the
island
so
prevailing
is
the
disposition
of
man
to
quarrel
and
shed
blood
so
prone
is
he
to
divisions
and
parties
that
even
the
ancient
natives
of
this
little
spot
were
separated
into
two
communities
inveterately
waging
war
against
each
other
like
the
more
powerful
tribes
of
the
continent
what
do
you
imagine
was
the
cause
of
this
national
quarrel
all
the
coast
of
their
island
equally
abounded
with
the
same
quantity
of
fish
and
clams
in
that
instance
there
could
be
no
jealousy
no
motives
to
anger
the
country
afforded
them
no
game
one
would
think
this
ought
to
have
been
the
country
of
harmony
and
peace
but
behold
the
singular
destiny
of
the
human
kind
ever
inferior
in
many
instances
to
the
more
certain
instinct
of
animals
among
which
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
are
always
friends
though
reared
in
different
climates
they
understand
the
same
language
they
shed
not
each
other
blood
they
eat
not
each
other
flesh
that
part
of
these
rude
people
who
lived
on
the
eastern
shores
of
the
island
had
from
time
immemorial
tried
to
destroy
those
who
lived
on
the
west
those
latter
inspired
with
the
same
evil
genius
had
not
been
behind
hand
in
retaliating
thus
was
a
perpetual
war
subsisting
between
these
people
founded
on
no
other
reason
but
the
adventitious
place
of
their
nativity
and
residence
in
process
of
time
both
parties
became
so
thin
and
depopulated
that
the
few
who
remained
fearing
lest
their
race
should
become
totally
extinct
fortunately
thought
of
an
expedient
which
prevented
their
entire
annihilation
some
years
before
the
europeans
came
they
mutually
agreed
to
settle
a
partition
line
which
should
divide
the
island
from
north
to
south
the
people
of
the
west
agreed
not
to
kill
those
of
the
east
except
they
were
found
transgressing
over
the
western
part
of
the
line
those
of
the
last
entered
into
a
reciprocal
agreement
by
these
simple
means
peace
was
established
among
them
and
this
is
the
only
record
which
seems
to
entitle
them
to
the
denomination
of
men
this
happy
settlement
put
a
stop
to
their
sanguinary
depredations
none
fell
afterward
but
a
few
rash
imprudent
individuals
on
the
contrary
they
multiplied
greatly
but
another
misfortune
awaited
them
when
the
europeans
came
they
caught
the
smallpox
and
their
improper
treatment
of
that
disorder
swept
away
great
numbers
this
calamity
was
succeeded
by
the
use
of
rum
and
these
are
the
two
principal
causes
which
so
much
diminished
their
numbers
not
only
here
but
all
over
the
continent
in
some
places
whole
nations
have
disappeared
some
years
ago
three
indian
canoes
on
their
return
to
detroit
from
the
falls
of
niagara
unluckily
got
the
smallpox
from
the
europeans
with
whom
they
had
traded
it
broke
out
near
the
long
point
on
lake
erie
there
they
all
perished
their
canoes
and
their
goods
were
afterwards
found
by
some
travellers
journeying
the
same
way
their
dogs
were
still
alive
besides
the
smallpox
and
the
use
of
spirituous
liquors
the
two
greatest
curses
they
have
received
from
us
there
is
a
sort
of
physical
antipathy
which
is
equally
powerful
from
one
end
of
the
continent
to
the
other
wherever
they
happen
to
be
mixed
or
even
to
live
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
europeans
they
become
exposed
to
a
variety
of
accidents
and
misfortunes
to
which
they
always
fall
victims
such
are
particular
fevers
to
which
they
were
strangers
before
and
sinking
into
a
singular
sort
of
indolence
and
sloth
this
has
been
invariably
the
case
wherever
the
same
association
has
taken
place
as
at
nattick
mashpe
soccanoket
in
the
bounds
of
falmouth
nobscusset
houratonick
monhauset
and
the
vineyard
even
the
mohawks
themselves
who
were
once
so
populous
and
such
renowned
warriors
are
now
reduced
to
less
than
since
the
european
settlements
have
circumscribed
the
territories
which
their
ancestors
had
reserved
three
years
before
the
arrival
of
the
europeans
at
cape
cod
a
frightful
distemper
had
swept
away
a
great
many
along
its
coasts
which
made
the
landing
and
intrusion
of
our
forefathers
much
easier
than
it
otherwise
might
have
been
in
the
year
above
half
of
the
indians
of
this
island
perished
by
a
strange
fever
which
the
europeans
who
nursed
them
never
caught
they
appear
to
be
a
race
doomed
to
recede
and
disappear
before
the
superior
genius
of
the
europeans
the
only
ancient
custom
of
these
people
that
is
remembered
is
that
in
their
mutual
exchanges
forty
clams
strung
on
a
string
passed
for
the
value
of
what
might
be
called
a
copper
they
were
strangers
to
the
use
and
value
of
wampum
so
well
known
to
those
of
the
main
the
few
families
now
remaining
are
meek
and
harmless
their
ancient
ferocity
is
gone
they
were
early
christianised
by
the
new
england
missionaries
as
well
as
those
of
the
vineyard
and
of
several
other
parts
of
massachusetts
and
to
this
day
they
remain
strict
observers
of
the
laws
and
customs
of
that
religion
being
carefully
taught
while
young
their
sedentary
life
has
led
them
to
this
degree
of
civilisation
much
more
effectually
than
if
they
had
still
remained
hunters
they
are
fond
of
the
sea
and
expert
mariners
they
have
learned
from
the
quakers
the
art
of
catching
both
the
cod
and
whale
in
consequence
of
which
five
of
them
always
make
part
of
the
complement
of
men
requisite
to
fit
out
a
whaleboat
many
have
removed
hither
from
the
vineyard
on
which
account
they
are
more
numerous
on
nantucket
than
anywhere
else
it
is
strange
what
revolution
has
happened
among
them
in
less
than
two
hundred
years
what
is
become
of
those
numerous
tribes
which
formerly
inhabited
the
extensive
shores
of
the
great

of
massachusetts

no

are
left
of
those

which
once
inhabited
this
country
and
replenished

sides
of

who

conveyed

to

company
they
have
all
disappeared
either
in
the
wars
which
the
europeans
carried
on
against
them
or
else
they
have
mouldered
away
gathered
in
some
of
their
ancient
towns
in
contempt
and
oblivion
nothing
remains
of
them
all
but
one
extraordinary
monument
and
even
this
they
owe
to
the
industry
and
religious
zeal
of
the
europeans
i
mean
the
bible
translated
into
the
nattick
tongue
many
of
these
tribes
giving
way
to
the
superior
power
of
the
whites
retired
to
their
ancient
villages
collecting
the
scattered
remains
of
nations
once
populous
and
in
their
grant
of
lands
reserved
to
themselves
and
posterity
certain
portions
which
lay
contiguous
to
them
there
forgetting
their
ancient
manners
they
dwelt
in
peace
in
a
few
years
their
territories
were
surrounded
by
the
improvements
of
the
europeans
in
consequence
of
which
they
grew
lazy
inactive
unwilling
and
unapt
to
imitate
or
to
follow
any
of
our
trades
and
in
a
few
generations
either
totally
perished
or
else
came
over
to
the
vineyard
or
to
this
island
to
themselves
with
such
societies
of
their
countrymen
as
would
receive
them
such
has
been
the
fate
of
many
nations
once
warlike
and
independent
what
we
see
now
on
the
main
or
on
those
islands
may
be
justly
considered
as
the
only
remains
of
those
ancient
tribes
might
i
be
permitted
to
pay
perhaps
a
very
useless
compliment
to
those
at
least
who
inhabited
the
great
peninsula
of
namset
now
cape
cod
with
whose
names
and
ancient
situation
i
am
well
acquainted
this
peninsula
was
divided
into
two
great
regions
that
on
the
side
of
the
bay
was
known
by
the
name
of
nobscusset
from
one
of
its
towns
the
capital
was
called
nausit
now
eastham
hence
the
indians
of
that
region
were
called
nausit
indians
though
they
dwelt
in
the
villages
of
pamet
nosset
pashee
potomaket
soktoowoket
nobscusset
yarmouth
the
region
on
the
atlantic
side
was
called
mashpee
and
contained
the
tribes
of
hyannees
costowet
waquoit
scootin
saconasset
mashpee
and
namset
several
of
these
indian
towns
have
been
since
converted
into
flourishing
european
settlements
known
by
different
names
for
as
the
natives
were
excellent
judges
of
land
which
they
had
fertilised
besides
with
the
shells
of
their
fish
the
latter
could
not
make
a
better
choice
though
in
general
this
great
peninsula
is
but
a
sandy
pine
track
a
few
good
spots
excepted
it
is
divided
into
seven
townships
viz
bamstable
yarmouth
harwich
chatham
eastham
pamet
namset
or
province
town
at
the
extremity
of
the
cape
yet
these
are
very
populous
though
i
am
at
a
loss
to
conceive
on
what
the
inhabitants
live
besides
clams
oysters
and
fish
their
piny
lands
being
the
most
ungrateful
soil
in
the
world
the
minister
of
namset
or
province
town
receives
from
the
government
of
massachusetts
a
salary
of
fifty
pounds
per
annum
and
such
is
the
poverty
of
the
inhabitants
of
that
place
that
unable
to
pay
him
any
money
each
master
of
a
family
is
obliged
to
allow
him
two
hundred
horse
feet
sea
spin
with
which
this
primitive
priest
fertilises
the
land
of
his
glebe
which
he
tills
himself
for
nothing
will
grow
on
these
hungry
soils
without
the
assistance
of
this
extraordinary
manure
fourteen
bushels
of
indian
corn
being
looked
upon
as
a
good
crop
but
it
is
time
to
return
from
a
digression
which
i
hope
you
will
pardon
nantucket
is
a
great
nursery
of
seamen
pilots
coasters
and
as
a
country
belonging
to
the
province
of
massachusetts
it
has
yearly
the
benefit
of
a
court
of
common
pleas
and
their
appeal
lies
to
the
supreme
court
at
boston
i
observed
before
that
the
friends
compose
of
the
magistracy
of
this
island
thus
they
are
the
proprietors
of
its
territory
and
the
principal
rulers
of
its
inhabitants
but
with
all
this
apparatus
of
law
its
coercive
powers
are
seldom
wanted
or
required
seldom
is
it
that
any
individual
is
amerced
or
punished
their
jail
conveys
no
terror
no
man
has
lost
his
life
here
judicially
since
the
foundation
of
this
town
which
is
upwards
of
an
hundred
years
solemn
tribunals
public
executions
humiliating
punishments
are
altogether
unknown
i
saw
neither
governors
nor
any
pageantry
of
state
neither
ostentatious
magistrates
nor
any
individuals
clothed
with
useless
dignity
no
artificial
phantoms
subsist
here
either
civil
or
religious
no
gibbets
loaded
with
guilty
citizens
offer
themselves
to
your
view
no
soldiers
are
appointed
to
bayonet
their
compatriots
into
servile
compliance
but
how
is
a
society
composed
of
individuals
preserved
in
the
bonds
of
peace
and
tranquillity
how
are
the
weak
protected
from
the
strong
i
will
tell
you
idleness
and
poverty
the
causes
of
so
many
crimes
are
unknown
here
each
seeks
in
the
prosecution
of
his
lawful
business
that
honest
gain
which
supports
them
every
period
of
their
time
is
full
either
on
shore
or
at
sea
a
probable
expectation
of
reasonable
profits
or
of
kindly
assistance
if
they
fail
of
success
renders
them
strangers
to
licentious
expedients
the
simplicity
of
their
manners
shortens
the
catalogues
of
their
wants
the
law
at
a

ever
ready
to
exert
itself
in
the
protection
of
those
who
stand
in
need
of
its
assistance
the
greatest
part
of
them
are
always
at
sea
pursuing
the
whale
or
raising
the
cod
from
the
surface
of
the
banks
some
cultivate
their
little
farms
with
the

some
are
employed
in
exercising
various
trades
others
again
in
providing
every
necessary
resource
in
order
to
refit
their
vessels
or
repair
what
misfortunes
may
happen
looking
out
for
future
markets
etc
such
is
the
rotation
of
those
different
scenes
of
business
which
fill
the
measure
of
their
days
of
that
part
of
their
lives
at
least
which
is
enlivened
by
health
spirits
and
vigour
it
is
but
seldom
that
vice
grows
on
a
barren
sand
like
this
which
produces
nothing
without
extreme
labour
how
could
the
common
follies
of
society
take
root
in
so
despicable
a
soil
they
generally
thrive
on
its
exuberant
juices
here
there
are
none
but
those
which
administer
to
the
useful
to
the
necessary
and
to
the
indispensable
comforts
of
life
this
land
must
necessarily
either
produce
health
temperance
and
a
great
equality
of
conditions
or
the
most
abject
misery
could
the
manners
of
luxurious
countries
be
imported
here
like
an
epidemical
disorder
they
would
destroy
everything
the
majority
of
them
could
not
exist
a
month
they
would
be
obliged
to
emigrate
as
in
all
societies
except
that
of
the
natives
some
difference
must
necessarily
exist
between
individual
and
individual
for
there
must
be
some
more
exalted
than
the
rest
either
by
their
riches
or
their
talents
so
in
this
there
are
what
you
might
call
the
high
the
middling
and
the
low
and
this
difference
will
always
be
more
remarkable
among
people
who
live
by
sea
excursions
than
among
those
who
live
by
the
cultivation
of
their
land
the
first
run
greater
hazard
and
adventure
more
the
profits
and
the
misfortunes
attending
this
mode
of
life
must
necessarily
introduce
a
greater
disparity
than
among
the
latter
where
the
equal
divisions
of
the
land
offers
no
short
road
to
superior
riches
the
only
difference
that
may
arise
among
them
is
that
of
industry
and
perhaps
of
superior
goodness
of
soil
the
gradations
i
observed
here
are
founded
on
nothing
more
than
the
good
or
ill
success
of
their
maritime
enterprises
and
do
not
proceed
from
education
that
is
the
same
throughout
every
class
simple
useful
and
unadorned
like
their
dress
and
their
houses
this
necessary
difference
in
their
fortunes
does
not
however
cause
those
heart
burnings
which
in
other
societies
generate
crimes
the
sea
which
surrounds
them
is
equally
open
to
all
and
presents
to
all
an
equal

to
the
chance
of

letter
v

education
and

of
the
inhabitants
of
nantucket
the
easiest
way
of
becoming
acquainted
with
the
modes
of
thinking
the
rules
of
conduct
and
the
prevailing
manners
of
any
people
is
to
examine
what
sort
of
education
they
give
their
children
how
they
treat
them
at
home
and
what
they
are
taught
in
their
places
of
public
worship
at
home
their
tender
minds
must
be
early
struck
with
the
gravity
the
serious
though
cheerful
deportment
of
their
parents
they
are
inured
to
a
principle
of
subordination
arising
neither
from
sudden
passions
nor
inconsiderate
pleasure
they
are

held
by

uniform

and

a

equanimity
prevails
in

of
their
families
and
bad

hardly
ever
sows
in
their
hearts
the
seeds
of

and
similar
faults
they
are
corrected
with
tenderness
nursed
with
the
most
affectionate
care
clad
with
that
decent
plainness
from
which
they
observe
their
parents
never
to
depart
in
short
by
the
force
of
example
which
is
superior
even
to
the
strongest
instinct
of
nature
more
than
by
precepts
they
learn
to
follow
the
steps
of
their
parents
to
despise
ostentatiousness
as
being
sinful
they
acquire
a
taste
for
neatness
for
which
their
fathers
are
so
conspicuous
they
learn
to
be
prudent
and
saving
the
very
tone
of
voice
with
which
they
are
always
addressed
establishes
in
them
that
softness
of
diction
which
ever
after
becomes

parents

of
training
up
children
to
the
same
uniformity
of
life
and
manners
if
they
are
left
with
fortunes
they
are
taught
how
to
save
them
and
how
to
enjoy
them
with
moderation
and
decency
if
they
have
none
they
know
how
to
venture

to
work
and

as
their

done

in

wherever
this
society
prevails
established

on
the
most
benevolent
principles

meetings
they
are
taught
the
few
the
simple
tenets
of
their
sect
tenets
as
fit
to
render
men
sober
industrious
just
and
merciful
as
those
delivered
in
the
most
magnificent
churches
and
cathedrals
they
are
instructed
in
the
most
essential
duties
of
christianity
so
as
not
to
offend
the
divinity
by
the
commission
of
evil
deeds
to
dread
his
wrath
and
the
punishments
he
has
denounced
they
are
taught
at
the
same
time
to
have
a
proper
confidence
in
his
mercy
while
they
deprecate
his
justice
as
every
sect
from
their
different
modes
of
worship
and
their
different
interpretations
of
some
parts
of
the
scriptures
necessarily
have
various
opinions
and
prejudices
which
contribute
something
in
forming
their
characters
in

are
well

even
to
resistance
justice
goodwill
to
all
benevolence
at
home
sobriety
meekness
neatness
love
of
order
fondness
and
appetite
for
commerce
they
are
as
remarkable
here
for
those
virtues
as
at
philadelphia
which
is
their
american
cradle
and
the
boast
of
that
society
at
schools
they
learn
to
read
and
to
write
a
good
hand
until
they
are
twelve
years
old
they
are
then
in
general
put
apprentices
to
the
cooper
trade
which
is
the
second
essential
branch
of
business
followed
here
at
fourteen
they
are
sent
to
sea
where
in
their
leisure
hours
their
companions
teach
them
the
art
of
navigation
which
they
have
an
opportunity
of
practising
on
the
spot
they
learn
the
great
and
useful
art
of
working
a
ship
in
all
the
different
situations
which
the
sea
and
wind
so
often
require
and
surely
there
can
not
be
a
better
or
a
more
useful
school
of
that
kind
in
the
world
then
they
go
gradually
through
every
station
of
rowers
steersmen
and
harpooners
thus
they
learn
to
attack
to
pursue
to
overtake
to
cut
to
dress
their
huge
game
and
after
having
performed
several
such
voyages
and
perfected
themselves
in
this
business
they
are
fit
either
for
the
counting
house
or
the
chase
the
first
proprietors
of
this
island
or
rather
the
first
founders
of
this
town
began
their
career
of
industry
with
a
single
boat
with
which
they
went
to
fish
for
cod
the
small
distance
from
their
shores
at
which
they
caught
it
enabled
them
soon
to
increase
their
business
and
those
early
successes
first
led
them
to
conceive
that
they
might
likewise
catch
the
whales
which
hitherto
sported
undisturbed
on
their
banks
after
many
trials
and
several
miscarriages
they
succeeded
thus
they
proceeded
step
by
step
the
profits
of
one
successful
enterprise
helped
them
to
purchase
and
prepare
better
materials
for
a
more
extensive
one
as
these
were
attended
with
little
costs
their
profits
grew
greater
the
south
sides
of
the
island
from
east
to
west
were
divided
into
four
equal
parts
and
each
part
was
assigned
to
a
company
of
six
which
though
thus
separated
still
carried
on
their
business
in
common
in
the
middle
of
this
distance
they
erected
a
mast
provided
with
a
sufficient
number
of
rounds
and
near
it
they
built
a
temporary
hut
where
five
of
the
associates
lived
whilst
the
sixth
from
his
high
station
carefully
looked
toward
the
sea
in
order
to
observe
the
spouting
of
the
whales
as
soon
as
any
were
discovered
the
sentinel
descended
the
was
launched
and
the
company
went
forth
in
quest
of
their
game
it
may
appear
strange
to
you
that
so
slender
a
vessel
as
an
american
containing
six
diminutive
beings
should
dare
to
pursue
and
to
attack
in
its
native
element
the
largest
and
strongest
fish
that
nature
has
created
yet
by
the
exertions
of
an
admirable
dexterity
improved
by
a
long
practice
in
which
these
people
are
become
superior
to
any
other
by
knowing
the
temper
of
the
whale
after
her
first
movement
and
by
many
other
useful
observations
they
seldom
failed
to
harpoon
it
and
to
bring
the
huge
leviathan
on
the
shores
thus
they
went
on
until
the
profits
they
made
enabled
them
to
purchase
larger
vessels
and
to
pursue
them
farther
when
the
whales
quitted
their
coasts
those
who
failed
in
their
enterprises
returned
to
the
which
had
been
their
first
school
and
their
first
resource
they
even
began
to
visit
the
banks
of
cape
breton
the
isle
of
sable
and
all
the
other
fishing
places
with
which
this
coast
of
america
abounds
by
degrees
they
went
to
newfoundland
to
the
gulf
of
lawrence
to
the
straits
of
belleisle
the
coast
of
labrador
davis
straits
even
to
cape
desolation
in
degrees
of
latitude
where
the
danes
carry
on
some
fisheries
in
spite
of
the
perpetual
severities
of
the
inhospitable
climate
in
process
of
time
they
visited
the
western
islands
the
latitude
of
degrees
famous
for
that
fish
the
brazils
the
coast
of
guinea
would
you
believe
that
they
have
already
gone
to
the
falkland
islands
and
that
i
have
heard
several
of
them
talk
of
going
to
the
south
sea
their
confidence
is
so
great
and
their
knowledge
of
this
branch
of
business
so
superior
to
that
of
any
other
people
that
they
have
acquired
a
monopoly
of
this
commodity
such
were
their
feeble
beginnings
such
the
infancy
and
the
progress
of
their
maritime
schemes
such
is
now
the
degree
of
boldness
and
activity
to
which
they
are
arrived
in
their
manhood
after
their
examples
several
companies
have
been
formed
in
many
of
our
capitals
where
every
necessary
article
of
provisions
implements
and
timber
are
to
be
found
but
the
industry
exerted
by
the
people
of
nantucket
hath
hitherto
enabled
them
to
rival
all
their
competitors
consequently
this
is
the
greatest
mart
for
oil
whalebone
and
spermaceti
on
the
continent
it
does
not
follow
however
that
they
are
always
successful
this
would
be
an
extraordinary
field
indeed
where
the
crops
should
never
fail
many
voyages
do
not
repay
the
original
cost
of
fitting
out
they
bear
such
misfortunes
like
true
merchants
and
as
they
never
venture
their
all
like
gamesters
they
try
their
fortunes
again
the
latter
hope
to
win
by
chance
alone
the
former
by
industry
well
judged
speculation
and
some
hazard
i
was
there
when
had
missed
one
of
his
vessels
she
had
been
given
over
for
lost
by
everybody
but
happily
arrived
before
i
came
away
after
an
absence
of
thirteen
months
she
had
met
with
a
variety
of
disappointments
on
the
station
she
was
ordered
to
and
rather
than
return
empty
the
people
steered
for
the
coast
of
guinea
where
they
fortunately
fell
in
with
several
whales
and
brought
home
upward
of
barrels
of
oil
beside
bone
those
returns
are
sometimes
disposed
of
in
the
towns
on
the
continent
where
they
are
exchanged
for
such
commodities
as
are
wanted
but
they
are
most
commonly
sent
to
england
where
they
always
sell
for
cash
when
this
is
intended
a
vessel
larger
than
the
rest
is
fitted
out
to
be
filled
with
oil
on
the
spot
where
it
is
found
and
made
and
thence
she
sails
immediately
for
london
this
expedient
saves
time
freight
and
expense
and
from
that
capital
they
bring
back
whatever
they
want
they
employ
also
several
vessels
in
transporting
lumber
to
the
west
indian
islands
from
whence
they
procure
in
return
the
various
productions
of
the
country
which
they
afterwards
exchange
wherever
they
can
hear
of
an
advantageous
market
being
extremely
acute
they
well
know
how
to
improve
all
the
advantages
which
the
combination
of
so
many
branches
of
business
constantly
affords
the
spirit
of
commerce
which
is
the
simple
art
of
a
reciprocal
supply
of
wants
is
well
understood
here
by
everybody
they
possess
like
the
generality
of
americans
a
large
share
of
native
penetration
activity
and
good
sense
which
lead
them
to
a
variety
of
other
secondary
schemes
too
tedious
to
mention
they
are
well
acquainted
with
the
cheapest
method
of
procuring
lumber
from
kennebeck
river
penobscot
pitch
and
tar
from
north
carolina
flour
and
biscuit
from
philadelphia
beef
and
pork
from
connecticut
they
know
how
to
exchange
their
cod
fish
and
indian
produce
for
those
articles
which
they
are
continually
either
bringing
to
their
island
or
sending
off
to
other
places
where
they
are
wanted
by
means
of
all
these
commercial
negotiations
they
have
greatly
cheapened
the
fitting
out
of
their
whaling
fleets
and
therefore
much
improved
their
fisheries
they
are
indebted
for
all
these
advantages
not
only
to
their
national
genius
but
to
the
poverty
of
their
soil
and
as
proof
of
what
i
have
so
often
advanced
look
at
the
vineyard
their
neighbouring
island
which
is
inhabited
by
a
set
of
people
as
keen
and
as
sagacious
as
themselves
their
soil
being
in
general
extremely
fertile
they
have
fewer
navigators
though
they
are
equally
well
situated
for
the
fishing
business
as
in
my
way
back
to
falmouth
on
the
main
i
visited
this
sister
island
permit
me
to
give
you
as
concisely
as
i
can
a
short
but
true
description
of
it
i
am
not
so
limited
in
the
principal
object
of
this
journey
as
to
wish
to
confine
myself
to
the
single
spot
of
nantucket
letter
vi
description
of
the
island
of
martha
vineyard
and
of
the
whale
fishery
this
island
is
twenty
miles
in
length
and
from
seven
to
eight
miles
in
breadth
it
lies
nine
miles
from
the
continent
and
with
the
elizabeth
islands
forms
one
of
the
counties
of
massachusetts
bay
known
by
the
name
of
duke
county
those
latter
which
are
six
in
number
are
about
nine
miles
distant
from
the
vineyard
and
are
all
famous
for
excellent
dairies
a
good
ferry
is
established
between
the
edgar
town
and
falmouth
on
the
main
the
distance
being
nine
miles
martha
vineyard
is
divided
into
three
townships
viz
edgar
chilmark
and
tisbury
the
number
of
inhabitants
is
computed
at
about
of
which
are
indians
edgar
is
the
best
seaport
and
the
shire
town
and
as
its
soil
is
light
and
sandy
many
of
its
inhabitants
follow
the
example
of
the
people
of
nantucket
the
town
of
chilmark
has
no
good
harbour
but
the
land
is
excellent
and
no
way
inferior
to
any
on
the
continent
it
contains
excellent
pastures
convenient
brooks
for
mills
stone
for
fencing
etc
the
town
of
tisbury
is
remarkable
for
the
excellence
of
its
timber
and
has
a
harbour
where
the
water
is
deep
enough
for
ships
of
the
line
the
stock
of
the
island
is
sheep
neat
cattle
beside
horses
and
goats
they
have
also
some
deer
and
abundance
of
fowls
this
has
been
from
the
beginning
and
is
to
this
day
the
principal
seminary
of
the
indians
they
live
on
that
part
of
the
island
which
is
called
chapoquidick
and
were
very
early
christianised
by
the
respectable
family
of
the
mahews
the
first
proprietors
of
it
the
first
settler
of
that
name
conveyed
by
will
to
a
favourite
daughter
a
certain
part
of
it
on
which
there
grew
many
wild
vines
thence
it
was
called
martha
vineyard
after
her
name
which
in
process
of
time
extended
to
the
whole
island
the
posterity
of
the
ancient
aborigines
remain
here
to
this
day
on
lands
which
their
forefathers
reserved
for
themselves
and
which
are
religiously
kept
from
any
encroachments
the
new
england
people
are
remarkable
for
the
honesty
with
which
they
have
fulfilled
all
over
that
province
those
ancient
covenants
which
in
many
others
have
been
disregarded
to
the
scandal
of
those
governments
the
indians
there
appeared
by
the
decency
of
their
manners
their
industry
and
neatness
to
be
wholly
europeans
and
nowise
inferior
to
many
of
the
inhabitants
like
them
they
are
sober
laborious
and
religious
which
are
the
principal
characteristics
of
the
four
new
england
provinces
they
often
go
like
the
young
men
of
the
vineyard
to
nantucket
and
hire
themselves
for
whalemen
or
fishermen
and
indeed
their
skill
and
dexterity
in
all
sea
affairs
is
nothing
inferior
to
that
of
the
whites
the
latter
are
divided
into
two
classes
the
first
occupy
the
land
which
they
till
with
admirable
care
and
knowledge
the
second
who
are
possessed
of
none
apply
themselves
to
the
sea
the
general
resource
of
mankind
in
this
part
of
the
world
this
island
therefore
like
nantucket
is
become
a
great
nursery
which
supplies
with
pilots
and
seamen
the
numerous
coasters
with
which
this
extended
part
of
america
abounds
go
where
you
will
from
nova
scotia
to
the
mississippi
you
will
find
almost
everywhere
some
natives
of
these
two
islands
employed
in
seafaring
occupations
their
climate
is
so
favourable
to
population
that
marriage
is
the
object
of
every
man
earliest
wish
and
it
is
a
blessing
so
easily
obtained
that
great
numbers
are
obliged
to
quit
their
native
land
and
go
to
some
other
countries
in
quest
of
subsistence
the
inhabitants
are
all
presbyterians
which
is
the
established
religion
of
massachusetts
and
here
let
me
remember
with
gratitude
the
hospitable
treatment
i
received
from
norton
the
colonel
of
the
island
as
well
as
from
mahew
the
lineal
descendant
of
the
first
proprietor
here
are
to
be
found
the
most
expert
pilots
either
for
the
great
bay
their
sound
nantucket
shoals
or
the
different
ports
in
their
neighbourhood
in
stormy
weather
they
are
always
at
sea
looking
out
for
vessels
which
they
board
with
singular
dexterity
and
hardly
ever
fail
to
bring
safe
to
their
intended
harbour
the
western
point
of
this
island
abounds
with
a
variety
of
ochres
of
different
colours
with
which
the
inhabitants
paint
their
houses
the
vessels
most
proper
for
whale
fishing
are
brigs
of
about
tons
burthen
particularly
when
they
are
intended
for
distant
latitudes
they
always
man
them
with
thirteen
hands
in
order
that
they
may
row
two
the
crews
of
which
must
necessarily
consist
of
six
four
at
the
oars
one
standing
on
the
bows
with
the
harpoon
and
the
other
at
the
helm
it
is
also
necessary
that
there
should
be
two
of
these
boats
that
if
one
should
be
destroyed
in
attacking
the
whale
the
other
which
is
never
engaged
at
the
same
time
may
be
ready
to
save
the
hands
five
of
the
thirteen
are
always
indians
the
last
of
the
complement
remains
on
board
to
steer
the
vessel
during
the
action
they
have
no
wages
each
draws
a
certain
established
share
in
partnership
with
the
proprietor
of
the
vessel
by
which
economy
they
are
all
proportionately
concerned
in
the
success
of
the
enterprise
and
all
equally
alert
and
vigilant
none
of
these
whalemen
ever
exceed
the
age
of
forty
they
look
on
those
who
are
past
that
period
not
to
be
possessed
of
all
that
vigour
and
agility
which
so
adventurous
a
business
requires
indeed
if
you
attentively
consider
the
immense
disproportion
between
the
object
assailed
and
the
assailants
if
you
think
on
the
diminutive
size
and
weakness
of
their
frail
vehicle
if
you
recollect
the
treachery
of
the
element
on
which
this
scene
is
transacted
the
sudden
and
unforeseen
accidents
of
winds
you
will
readily
acknowledge
that
it
must
require
the
most
consummate
exertion
of
all
the
strength
agility
and
judgment
of
which
the
bodies
and
minds
of
men
are
capable
to
undertake
these
adventurous
encounters
as
soon
as
they
arrive
in
those
latitudes
where
they
expect
to
meet
with
whales
a
man
is
sent
up
to
the
mast
head
if
he
sees
one
he
immediately
cries
out
awaite
pawana
here
is
a
whale
they
all
remain
still
and
silent
until
he
repeats
pawana
a
whale
when
in
less
than
six
minutes
the
two
boats
are
launched
filled
with
every
implement
necessary
for
the
attack
they
row
toward
the
whale
with
astonishing
velocity
and
as
the
indians
early
became
their
labourers
in
this
new
warfare
you
can
easily
conceive
how
the
nattick
expressions
became
familiar
on
board
the
formerly
it
often
happened
that
whale
vessels
were
manned
with
none
but
indians
and
the
master
recollect
also
that
the
nantucket
people
understand
the
nattick
and
that
there
are
always
five
of
these
people
on
board
there
are
various
ways
of
approaching
the
whale
according
to
their
peculiar
species
and
this
previous
knowledge
is
of
the
utmost
consequence
when
these
boats
are
arrived
at
a
reasonable
distance
one
of
them
rests
on
its
oars
and
stands
off
as
a
witness
of
the
approaching
engagement
near
the
bows
of
the
other
the
harpooner
stands
up
and
on
him
principally
depends
the
success
of
the
enterprise
he
wears
a
jacket
closely
buttoned
and
round
his
head
a
handkerchief
tightly
bound
in
his
hands
he
holds
the
dreadful
weapon
made
of
the
best
steel
marked
sometimes
with
the
name
of
their
town
and
sometimes
with
that
of
their
vessel
to
the
shaft
of
which
the
end
of
a
cord
of
due
length
coiled
up
with
the
utmost
care
in
the
middle
of
the
boat
is
firmly
tied
the
other
end
is
fastened
to
the
bottom
of
the
boat
thus
prepared
they
row
in
profound
silence
leaving
the
whole
conduct
of
the
enterprise
to
the
harpooner
and
to
the
steersman
attentively
following
their
directions
when
the
former
judges
himself
to
be
near
enough
to
the
whale
that
is
at
the
distance
of
about
fifteen
feet
he
bids
them
stop
perhaps
she
has
a
calf
whose
safety
attracts
all
the
attention
of
the
dam
which
is
a
favourable
circumstance
perhaps
she
is
of
a
dangerous
species
and
it
is
safest
to
retire
though
their
ardour
will
seldom
permit
them
perhaps
she
is
asleep
in
that
case
he
balances
high
the
harpoon
trying
in
this
important
moment
to
collect
all
the
energy
of
which
he
is
capable
he
launches
it
forth
she
is
struck
from
her
first
movements
they
judge
of
her
temper
as
well
as
of
their
future
success
sometimes
in
the
immediate
impulse
of
rage
she
will
attack
the
boat
and
demolish
it
with
one
stroke
of
her
tail
in
an
instant
the
frail
vehicle
disappears
and
the
assailants
are
immersed
in
the
dreadful
element
were
the
whale
armed
with
the
jaws
of
a
shark
and
as
voracious
they
never
would
return
home
to
amuse
their
listening
wives
with
the
interesting
tale
of
the
adventure
at
other
times
she
will
dive
and
disappear
from
human
sight
and
everything
must
give
way
to
her
velocity
or
else
all
is
lost
sometimes
she
will
swim
away
as
if
untouched
and
draw
the
cord
with
such
swiftness
that
it
will
set
the
edge
of
the
boat
on
fire
by
the
friction
if
she
rises
before
she
has
run
out
the
whole
length
she
is
looked
upon
as
a
sure
prey
the
blood
she
has
lost
in
her
flight
weakens
her
so
much
that
if
she
sinks
again
it
is
but
for
a
short
time
the
boat
follows
her
course
with
almost
equal
speed
she
soon
tired
at
last
with
convulsing
the
element
which
she
tinges
with
her
blood
she
dies
and
floats
on
the
surface
at
other
times
it
may
happen
that
she
is
not
dangerously
wounded
though
she
carries
the
harpoon
fast
in
her
body
when
she
will
alternately
dive
and
rise
and
swim
on
with
unabated
vigour
she
then
soon
reaches
beyond
the
length
of
the
cord
and
carries
the
boat
along
with
amazing
velocity
this
sudden
impediment
sometimes
will
retard
her
speed
at
other
times
it
only
serves
to
rouse
her
anger
and
to
accelerate
her
progress
the
harpooner
with
the
axe
in
his
hands
stands
ready
when
he
observes
that
the
bows
of
the
boat
are
greatly
pulled
down
by
the
diving
whale
and
that
it
begins
to
sink
deep
and
to
take
much
water
he
brings
the
axe
almost
in
contact
with
the
cord
he
pauses
still
flattering
himself
that
she
will
relax
but
the
moment
grows
critical
unavoidable
danger
approaches
sometimes
men
more
intent
on
gain
than
on
the
preservation
of
their
lives
will
run
great
risks
and
it
is
wonderful
how
far
these
people
have
carried
their
daring
courage
at
this
awful
moment
but
it
is
vain
to
hope
their
lives
must
be
saved
the
cord
is
cut
the
boat
rises
again
if
after
thus
getting
loose
she
they
will
attack
and
wound
her
a
second
time
she
soon
dies
and
when
dead
she
is
towed
alongside
of
their
vessel
where
she
is
fastened
the
next
operation
is
to
cut
with
axes
and
spades
every
part
of
her
body
which
yields
oil
the
kettles
are
set
a
boiling
they
fill
their
barrels
as
fast
as
it
is
made
but
as
this
operation
is
much
slower
than
that
of
cutting
up
they
fill
the
hold
of
their
ship
with
those
fragments
lest
a
storm
should
arise
and
oblige
them
to
abandon
their
prize
it
is
astonishing
what
a
quantity
of
oil
some
of
these
fish
will
yield
and
what
profit
it
affords
to
those
who
are
fortunate
enough
to
overtake
them
the
river
lawrence
whale
which
is
the
only
one
i
am
well
acquainted
with
is
feet
long
sixteen
deep
twelve
in
the
length
of
its
bone
which
commonly
weighs
twenty
in
the
breadth
of
their
tails
and
produces
barrels
of
oil
i
once
saw
boiled
out
of
the
tongue
only
after
having
once
vanquished
this
leviathan
there
are
two
enemies
to
be
dreaded
beside
the
wind
the
first
of
which
is
the
shark
that
fierce
voracious
fish
to
which
nature
has
given
such
dreadful
offensive
weapons
often
comes
alongside
and
in
spite
of
the
people
endeavours
will
share
with
them
their
prey
at
night
particularly
they
are
very
mischievious
but
the
second
enemy
is
much
more
terrible
and
irresistible
it
is
the
killer
sometimes
called
the
thrasher
a
species
of
whales
about
thirty
feet
long
they
are
possessed
of
such
a
degree
of
agility
and
fierceness
as
often
to
attack
the
largest
spermaceti
whales
and
not
seldom
to
rob
the
fishermen
of
their
prey
nor
is
there
any
means
of
defence
against
so
potent
an
adversary
when
all
their
barrels
are
full
for
everything
is
done
at
sea
or
when
their
limited
time
is
expired
and
their
stores
almost
expended
they
return
home
freighted
with
their
valuable
cargo
unless
they
have
put
it
on
board
a
vessel
for
the
european
market
such
are
as
briefly
as
i
can
relate
them
the
different
branches
of
the
economy
practised
by
these
bold
navigators
and
the
method
with
which
they
go
such
distances
from
their
island
to
catch
this
huge
game
the
following
are
the
names
and
principal
characteristics
of
the
various
species
of
whales
known
to
these
people
the
lawrence
whale
just
described
the
disko
or
greenland
ditto
the
right
whale
or
seven
feet
bone
common
on
the
coasts
of
this
country
about
sixty
feet
long
the
spermaceti
whale
found
all
over
the
world
and
of
all
sizes
the
longest
are
sixty
feet
and
yield
about
barrels
of
oil
the
on
the
coast
of
newfoundland
from
forty
to
seventy
feet
in
length
the
an
american
whale
never
killed
as
being
too
swift
the
river
lawrence
ninety
foot
long
they
are
but
seldom
killed
as
being
extremely
swift
the
grampus
thirty
feet
long
never
killed
on
the
same
account
the
killer
or
thrasher
about
thirty
feet
they
often
kill
the
other
whales
with
which
they
are
at
perpetual
war
the
black
fish
whale
twenty
feet
yields
from
eight
to
ten
barrels
the
porpoise
weighing
about
lb
in
they
fitted
out
whalemen
the
first
fifty
that
returned
brought
with
them
barrels
of
oil
in
they
fitted
out
vessels
for
the
fisheries
at
thirteen
hands
each
four
indiamen
twelve
hands
wood
vessels
four
hands
eighteen
coasters
five
hands
fifteen
london
traders
eleven
hands
all
these
amount
to
hands
employed
in
vessels
trace
their
progressive
steps
between
the
possession
of
a
few
and
that
of
such
a
fleet
the
moral
conduct
prejudices
and
customs
of
a
people
who
live
thirds
of
their
time
at
sea
must
naturally
be
very
different
from
those
of
their
neighbours
who
live
by
cultivating
the
earth
that
long
abstemiousness
to
which
the
former
are
exposed
the
breathing
of
saline
air
the
frequent
repetitions
of
danger
the
boldness
acquired
in
surmounting
them
the
very
impulse
of
the
winds
to
which
they
are
exposed
all
these
one
would
imagine
must
lead
them
when
on
shore
to
no
small
desire
of
inebriation
and
a
more
eager
pursuit
of
those
pleasures
of
which
they
have
been
so
long
deprived
and
which
they
must
soon
forego
there
are
many
appetites
that
may
be
gratified
on
shore
even
by
the
poorest
man
but
which
must
remain
unsatisfied
at
sea
yet
notwithstanding
the
powerful
effects
of
all
these
causes
i
observed
here
at
the
return
of
their
fleets
no
material
irregularities
no
tumultuous
drinking
assemblies
whereas
in
our
continental
towns
the
thoughtless
seaman
indulges
himself
in
the
coarsest
pleasures
and
vainly
thinking
that
a
week
of
debauchery
can
compensate
for
months
of
abstinence
foolishly
lavishes
in
a
few
days
of
intoxication
the
fruits
of
half
a
year
labour
on
the
contrary
all
was
peace
here
and
a
general
decency
prevailed
throughout
the
reason
i
believe
is
that
almost
everybody
here
is
married
for
they
get
wives
very
young
and
the
pleasure
of
returning
to
their
families
absorbs
every
other
desire
the
motives
that
lead
them
to
the
sea
are
very
different
from
those
of
most
other
men
it
is
neither
idleness
nor
profligacy
that
sends
them
to
that
element
it
is
a
settled
plan
of
life
a
well
founded
hope
of
earning
a
livelihood
it
is
because
their
soil
is
bad
that
they
are
early
initiated
to
this
profession
and
were
they
to
stay
at
home
what
could
they
do
the
sea
therefore
becomes
to
them
a
kind
of
patrimony
they
go
to
whaling
with
as
much
pleasure
and
tranquil
indifference
with
as
strong
an
expectation
of
success
as
a
landsman
undertakes
to
clear
a
piece
of
swamp
the
first
is
obliged
to
advance
his
time
and
labour
to
procure
oil
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
the
second
advances
the
same
to
procure
himself
grass
from
grounds
that
produced
nothing
before
but
hassocks
and
bogs
among
those
who
do
not
use
the
sea
i
observed
the
same
calm
appearance
as
among
the
inhabitants
on
the
continent
here
i
found
without
gloom
a
decorum
and
reserve
so
natural
to
them
that
i
thought
myself
in
philadelphia
at
my
landing
i
was
cordially
received
by
those
to
whom
i
was
recommended
and
treated
with
unaffected
hospitality
by
such
others
with
whom
i
became
acquainted
and
i
can
tell
you
that
it
is
impossible
for
any
traveller
to
dwell
here
one
month
without
knowing
the
heads
of
the
principal
families
wherever
i
went
i
found
a
simplicity
of
diction
and
manners
rather
more
primitive
and
rigid
than
i
expected
and
i
soon
perceived
that
it
proceeded
from
their
secluded
situation
which
has
prevented
them
from
mixing
with
others
it
is
therefore
easy
to
conceive
how
they
have
retained
every
degree
of
peculiarity
for
which
this
sect
was
formerly
distinguished
never
was
a
more
faithfully
employed
in
gathering
wax
and
honey
from
all
the
neighbouring
fields
than
are
the
members
of
this
society
every
one
in
the
town
follows
some
particular
occupation
with
great
diligence
but
without
that
servility
of
labour
which
i
am
informed
prevails
in
europe
the
mechanic
seemed
to
be
descended
from
as
good
parentage
was
as
well
dressed
and
fed
and
held
in
as
much
estimation
as
those
who
employed
him
they
were
once
nearly
related
their
different
degrees
of
prosperity
is
what
has
caused
the
various
shades
of
their
community
but
this
accidental
difference
has
introduced
as
yet
neither
arrogance
nor
pride
on
the
one
part
nor
meanness
and
servility
on
the
other
all
their
houses
are
neat
convenient
and
comfortable
some
of
them
are
filled
with
two
families
for
when
the
husbands
are
at
sea
the
wives
require
less
they
all
abound
with
the
most
substantial
furniture
more
valuable
from
its
usefulness
than
from
any
ornamental
appearance
wherever
i
went
i
found
good
cheer
a
welcome
reception
and
after
the
second
visit
i
felt
myself
as
much
at
my
ease
as
if
i
had
been
an
old
acquaintance
of
the
family
they
had
as
great
plenty
of
everything
as
if
their
island
had
been
part
of
the
golden
quarter
of
virginia
a
valuable
track
of
land
on
cape
charles
i
could
hardly
persuade
myself
that
i
had
quitted
the
adjacent
continent
where
everything
abounds
and
that
i
was
on
a
barren
fertilised
with
whale
oil
only
as
their
rural
improvements
are
but
trifling
and
only
of
the
useful
kind
and
as
the
best
of
them
are
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
town
i
amused
myself
for
several
days
in
conversing
with
the
most
intelligent
of
the
inhabitants
of
both
sexes
and
making
myself
acquainted
with
the
various
branches
of
their
industry
the
different
objects
of
their
trade
the
nature
of
that
sagacity
which
deprived
as
they
are
of
every
necessary
material
produce
yet
enables
them
to
flourish
to
live
well
and
sometimes
to
make
considerable
fortunes
the
whole
is
an
enigma
to
be
solved
only
by
coming
to
the
spot
and
observing
the
national
genius
which
the
original
founders
brought
with
them
as
well
as
their
unwearied
patience
and
perseverance
they
have
all
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
a
singular
keenness
of
judgment
unassisted
by
any
academical
light
they
all
possess
a
large
share
of
good
sense
improved
upon
the
experience
of
their
fathers
and
this
is
the
surest
and
best
guide
to
lead
us
through
the
path
of
life
because
it
approaches
nearest
to
the
infallibility
of
instinct
shining
talents
and
university
knowledge
would
be
entirely
useless
here
nay
would
be
dangerous
it
would
pervert
their
plain
judgment
it
would
lead
them
out
of
that
useful
path
which
is
so
well
adapted
to
their
situation
it
would
make
them
more
adventurous
more
presumptuous
much
less
cautious
and
therefore
less
successful
it
is
pleasing
to
hear
some
of
them
tracing
a
father
progress
and
their
own
through
the
different
vicissitudes
of
good
and
adverse
fortune
i
have
often
by
their
travelled
with
them
the
whole
length
of
their
career
from
their
earliest
steps
from
their
first
commercial
adventure
from
the
possession
of
a
single
boat
up
to
that
of
a
dozen
large
vessels
this
does
not
imply
however
that
every
one
who
began
with
a
has
ascended
to
a
like
pitch
of
fortune
by
no
means
the
same
casualty
the
same
combination
of
good
and
evil
which
attends
human
affairs
in
every
other
part
of
the
globe
prevails
here
a
great
prosperity
is
not
the
lot
of
every
man
but
there
are
many
and
various
gradations
if
they
all
do
not
attain
riches
they
all
attain
an
easy
subsistence
after
all
is
it
not
better
to
be
possessed
of
a
single
or
a
few
sheep
pastures
to
live
free
and
independent
under
the
mildest
governments
in
a
healthy
climate
in
a
land
of
charity
and
benevolence
than
to
be
wretched
as
so
many
are
in
europe
possessing
nothing
but
their
industry
tossed
from
one
rough
wave
to
another
engaged
either
in
the
most
servile
labours
for
the
smallest
pittance
or
fettered
with
the
links
of
the
most
irksome
dependence
even
without
the
hopes
of
rising
the
majority
of
those
inferior
hands
which
are
employed
in
this
fishery
many
of
the
mechanics
such
as
coopers
smiths
caulkers
carpenters
who
do
not
belong
to
the
society
of
friends
are
presbyterians
and
originally
came
from
the
main
those
who
are
possessed
of
the
greatest
fortunes
at
present
belong
to
the
former
but
they
all
began
as
simple
whalemen
it
is
even
looked
upon
as
honourable
and
necessary
for
the
son
of
the
wealthiest
man
to
serve
an
apprenticeship
to
the
same
bold
adventurous
business
which
has
enriched
his
father
they
go
several
voyages
and
these
early
excursions
never
fail
to
harden
their
constitutions
and
introduce
them
to
the
knowledge
of
their
future
means
of
subsistence
letter
vii
manners
and
customs
at
nantucket
as
i
observed
before
every
man
takes
a
wife
as
soon
as
he
chooses
and
that
is
generally
very
early
no
portion
is
required
none
is
expected
no
marriage
articles
are
drawn
up
among
us
by
skilful
lawyers
to
puzzle
and
lead
posterity
to
the
bar
or
to
satisfy
the
pride
of
the
parties
we
give
nothing
with
our
daughters
their
education
their
health
and
the
customary
are
all
that
the
fathers
of
numerous
families
can
afford
as
the
wife
fortune
consists
principally
in
her
future
economy
modesty
and
skilful
management
so
the
husband
is
founded
on
his
abilities
to
labour
on
his
health
and
the
knowledge
of
some
trade
or
business
their
mutual
endeavours
after
a
few
years
of
constant
application
seldom
fail
of
success
and
of
bringing
them
the
means
to
rear
and
support
the
new
race
which
accompanies
the
nuptial
bed
those
children
born
by
the
hear
the
roaring
of
its
waves
as
soon
as
they
are
able
to
listen
it
is
the
first
noise
with
which
they
become
acquainted
and
by
early
plunging
in
it
they
acquire
that
boldness
that
presence
of
mind
and
dexterity
which
makes
them
ever
after
such
expert
seamen
they
often
hear
their
fathers
recount
the
adventures
of
their
youth
their
combats
with
the
whales
and
these
recitals
imprint
on
their
opening
minds
an
early
curiosity
and
taste
for
the
same
life
they
often
cross
the
sea
to
go
to
the
main
and
learn
even
in
those
short
voyages
how
to
qualify
themselves
for
longer
and
more
dangerous
ones
they
are
therefore
deservedly
conspicuous
for
their
maritime
knowledge
and
experience
all
over
the
continent
a
man
born
here
is
distinguishable
by
his
gait
from
among
an
hundred
other
men
so
remarkable
are
they
for
a
pliability
of
sinews
and
a
peculiar
agility
which
attends
them
even
to
old
age
i
have
heard
some
persons
attribute
this
to
the
effects
of
the
whale
oil
with
which
they
are
so
copiously
anointed
in
the
various
operations
it
must
undergo
ere
it
is
fit
either
for
the
european
market
or
the
candle
manufactory
but
you
may
perhaps
be
solicitous
to
ask
what
becomes
of
that
exuberancy
of
population
which
must
arise
from
so
much
temperance
from
healthiness
of
climate
and
from
early
marriage
you
may
justly
conclude
that
their
native
island
and
town
can
contain
but
a
limited
number
emigration
is
both
natural
and
easy
to
a
maritime
people
and
that
is
the
very
reason
why
they
are
always
populous
problematical
as
it
may
appear
they
yearly
go
to
different
parts
of
this
continent
constantly
engaged
in
sea
affairs
as
our
internal
riches
increase
so
does
our
external
trade
which
consequently
requires
more
ships
and
more
men
sometimes
they
have
emigrated
like
bees
in
regular
and
connected
swarms
some
of
the
friends
by
which
word
i
always
mean
the
people
called
quakers
fond
of
a
contemplative
life
yearly
visit
the
several
congregations
which
this
society
has
formed
throughout
the
continent
by
their
means
a
sort
of
correspondence
is
kept
up
among
them
all
they
are
generally
good
preachers
friendly
censors
checking
vice
wherever
they
find
it
predominating
preventing
relaxations
in
any
parts
of
their
ancient
customs
and
worship
they
everywhere
carry
admonition
and
useful
advice
and
by
thus
travelling
they
unavoidably
gather
the
most
necessary
observations
concerning
the
various
situations
of
particular
districts
their
soils
their
produce
their
distance
from
navigable
rivers
the
price
of
land
etc
in
consequence
of
informations
of
this
kind
received
at
nantucket
in
the
year
a
considerable
number
of
them
purchased
a
large
track
of
land
in
the
county
of
orange
in
north
carolina
situated
on
the
several
spring
heads
of
deep
river
which
is
the
western
branch
of
cape
fear
or
river
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
convey
themselves
by
sea
to
within
forty
miles
of
the
spot
the
richness
of
the
soil
made
them
cheerfully
quit
an
island
on
which
there
was
no
longer
any
room
for
them
there
they
have
founded
a
beautiful
settlement
known
by
the
name
of
new
garden
contiguous
to
the
famous
one
which
the
moravians
have
at
bethabara
bethamia
and
salem
on
yadkin
river
no
spot
of
earth
can
be
more
beautiful
it
is
composed
of
gentle
hills
of
easy
declivities
excellent
low
lands
accompanied
by
different
brooks
which
traverse
this
settlement
i
never
saw
a
soil
that
rewards
men
so
early
for
their
labours
and
disbursements
such
in
general
with
very
few
exceptions
are
the
lands
which
adjoin
the
innumerable
heads
of
all
the
large
rivers
which
fall
into
the
chesapeak
or
flow
through
the
provinces
of
north
and
south
carolina
georgia
etc
it
is
perhaps
the
most
pleasing
the
most
bewitching
country
which
the
continent
affords
because
while
it
preserves
an
easy
communication
with
the
towns
at
some
seasons
of
the
year
it
is
perfectly
free
from
the
contagious
air
often
breathed
in
those
flat
countries
which
are
more
contiguous
to
the
atlantic
these
lands
are
as
rich
as
those
over
the
alleghany
the
people
of
new
garden
are
situated
at
the
distance
of
between
and
miles
from
cape
fear
cape
fear
is
at
least
from
nantucket
you
may
judge
therefore
that
they
have
but
little
correspondence
with
this
their
little
metropolis
except
it
is
by
means
of
the
itinerant
friends
others
have
settled
on
the
famous
river
kennebeck
in
that
territory
of
the
province
of
massachusetts
which
is
known
by
the
name
of
sagadahock
here
they
have
softened
the
labours
of
clearing
the
heaviest
timbered
land
in
america
by
means
of
several
branches
of
trade
which
their
fair
river
and
proximity
to
the
sea
affords
them
instead
of
entirely
consuming
their
timber
as
we
are
obliged
to
do
some
parts
of
it
are
converted
into
useful
articles
for
exportation
such
as
staves
scantlings
boards
hoops
poles
etc
for
that
purpose
they
keep
a
correspondence
with
their
native
island
and
i
know
many
of
the
principal
inhabitants
of
sherburn
who
though
merchants
and
living
at
nantucket
yet
possess
valuable
farms
on
that
river
from
whence
they
draw
great
part
of
their
subsistence
meat
grain
etc
the
title
of
these
lands
is
vested
in
the
ancient
plymouth
company
under
the
powers
of
which
the
massachusetts
was
settled
and
that
company
which
resides
in
boston
are
still
the
granters
of
all
the
vacant
lands
within
their
limits
although
this
part
of
the
province
is
so
fruitful
and
so
happily
situated
yet
it
has
been
singularly
overlooked
and
neglected
it
is
surprising
that
the
excellence
of
that
soil
which
lies
on
the
river
should
not
have
caused
it
to
be
filled
before
now
with
inhabitants
for
the
settlements
from
thence
to
penobscot
are
as
yet
but
in
their
infancy
it
is
true
that
immense
labour
is
required
to
make
room
for
the
plough
but
the
peculiar
strength
and
quality
of
the
soil
never
fails
most
amply
to
reward
the
industrious
possessor
i
know
of
no
soil
in
this
country
more
rich
or
more
fertile
i
do
not
mean
that
sort
of
transitory
fertility
which
evaporates
with
the
sun
and
disappears
in
a
few
years
here
on
the
contrary
even
their
highest
grounds
are
covered
with
a
rich
moist
swamp
mould
which
bears
the
most
luxuriant
grass
and
crops
of
grain
if
new
gardens
exceeds
this
settlement
by
the
softness
of
its
climate
the
fecundity
of
its
soil
and
a
greater
variety
of
produce
from
less
labour
it
does
not
breed
men
equally
hardy
nor
capable
to
encounter
dangers
and
fatigues
it
leads
too
much
to
idleness
and
effeminacy
for
great
is
the
luxuriance
of
that
part
of
america
and
the
ease
with
which
the
earth
is
cultivated
were
i
to
begin
life
again
i
would
prefer
the
country
of
kennebeck
to
the
other
however
bewitching
the
navigation
of
the
river
for
above
miles
the
great
abundance
of
fish
it
contains
the
constant
healthiness
of
the
climate
the
happy
severities
of
the
winters
always
sheltering
the
earth
with
a
voluminous
coat
of
snow
the
equally
happy
necessity
of
labour
all
these
reasons
would
greatly
preponderate
against
the
softer
situations
of
carolina
where
mankind
reap
too
much
do
not
toil
enough
and
are
liable
to
enjoy
too
fast
the
benefits
of
life
there
are
many
i
know
who
would
despise
my
opinion
and
think
me
a
bad
judge
let
those
go
and
settle
at
the
ohio
the
monongahela
red
stone
creek
let
them
go
and
inhabit
the
extended
shores
of
that
superlative
river
i
with
equal
cheerfulness
would
pitch
my
tent
on
the
rougher
shores
of
kennebeck
this
will
always
be
a
country
of
health
labour
and
strong
activity
and
those
are
characteristics
of
society
which
i
value
more
than
greater
opulence
and
voluptuous
ease
thus
though
this
fruitful
hive
constantly
sends
out
swarms
as
industrious
as
themselves
yet
it
always
remains
full
without
having
any
useless
drones
on
the
contrary
it
exhibits
constant
scenes
of
business
and
new
schemes
the
richer
an
individual
grows
the
more
extensive
his
field
of
action
becomes
he
that
is
near
ending
his
career
drudges
on
as
well
as
he
who
has
just
begun
it
nobody
stands
still
but
is
it
not
strange
that
after
having
accumulated
riches
they
should
never
wish
to
exchange
their
barren
situation
for
a
more
sheltered
more
pleasant
one
on
the
main
is
it
not
strange
that
after
having
spent
the
morning
and
the
meridian
of
their
days
amidst
the
jarring
waves
weary
with
the
toils
of
a
laborious
life
they
should
not
wish
to
enjoy
the
evenings
of
those
days
of
industry
in
a
larger
society
on
some
spots
of
terra
firma
where
the
severity
of
the
winters
is
balanced
by
a
variety
of
more
pleasing
scenes
not
to
be
found
here
but
the
same
magical
power
of
habit
and
custom
which
makes
the
laplander
the
siberian
the
hottentot
prefer
their
climates
their
occupations
and
their
soil
to
more
beneficial
situations
leads
these
good
people
to
think
that
no
other
spot
on
the
globe
is
so
analagous
to
their
inclinations
as
nantucket
here
their
connections
are
formed
what
would
they
do
at
a
distance
removed
from
them
live
sumptuously
you
will
say
procure
themselves
new
friends
new
acquaintances
by
their
splendid
tables
by
their
ostentatious
generosity
and
by
affected
hospitality
these
are
thoughts
that
have
never
entered
into
their
heads
they
would
be
filled
with
horror
at
the
thought
of
forming
wishes
and
plans
so
different
from
that
simplicity
which
is
their
general
standard
in
affluence
as
well
as
in
poverty
they
abhor
the
very
idea
of
expending
in
useless
waste
and
vain
luxuries
the
fruits
of
prosperous
labour
they
are
employed
in
establishing
their
sons
and
in
many
other
useful
purposes
strangers
to
the
honours
of
monarchy
they
do
not
aspire
to
the
possession
of
affluent
fortunes
with
which
to
purchase
sounding
titles
and
frivolous
names
yet
there
are
not
at
nantucket
so
many
wealthy
people
as
one
would
imagine
after
having
considered
their
great
successes
their
industry
and
their
knowledge
many
die
poor
though
hardly
able
to
reproach
fortune
with
a
frown
others
leave
not
behind
them
that
affluence
which
the
circle
of
their
business
and
of
their
prosperity
naturally
promised
the
reason
of
this
is
i
believe
the
peculiar
expense
necessarily
attending
their
tables
for
as
their
island
supplies
the
town
with
little
or
nothing
a
few
families
excepted
every
one
must
procure
what
they
want
from
the
main
the
very
hay
their
horses
consume
and
every
other
article
necessary
to
support
a
family
though
cheap
in
a
country
of
so
great
abundance
as
massachusetts
yet
the
necessary
waste
and
expenses
attending
their
transport
render
these
commodities
dear
a
vast
number
of
little
vessels
from
the
main
and
from
the
vineyard
are
constantly
resorting
here
as
to
a
market
sherburn
is
extremely
well
supplied
with
everything
but
this
very
constancy
of
supply
necessarily
drains
off
a
great
deal
of
money
the
first
use
they
make
of
their
oil
and
bone
is
to
exchange
it
for
bread
and
meat
and
whatever
else
they
want
the
necessities
of
a
large
family
are
very
great
and
numerous
let
its
economy
be
what
it
will
they
are
so
often
repeated
that
they
perpetually
draw
off
a
considerable
branch
of
the
profits
if
by
any
accidents
those
profits
are
interrupted
the
capital
must
suffer
and
it
very
often
happens
that
the
greatest
part
of
their
property
is
floating
on
the
sea
there
are
but
two
congregations
in
this
town
they
assemble
every
sunday
in
meeting
houses
as
simple
as
the
dwelling
of
the
people
and
there
is
but
one
priest
on
the
whole
island
what
would
a
good
portuguese
observe
but
one
single
priest
to
instruct
a
whole
island
and
to
direct
their
consciences
it
is
even
so
each
individual
knows
how
to
guide
his
own
and
is
content
to
do
it
as
well
as
he
can
this
lonely
clergyman
is
a
presbyterian
minister
who
has
a
very
large
and
respectable
congregation
the
other
is
composed
of
quakers
who
you
know
admit
of
no
particular
person
who
in
consequence
of
being
ordained
becomes
exclusively
entitled
to
preach
to
catechise
and
to
receive
certain
salaries
for
his
trouble
among
them
every
one
may
expound
the
scriptures
who
thinks
he
is
called
so
to
do
beside
as
they
admit
of
neither
sacrament
baptism
nor
any
other
outward
forms
whatever
such
a
man
would
be
useless
most
of
these
people
are
continually
at
sea
and
have
often
the
most
urgent
reasons
to
worship
the
parent
of
nature
in
the
midst
of
the
storms
which
they
encounter
these
two
sects
live
in
perfect
peace
and
harmony
with
each
other
those
ancient
times
of
religious
discords
are
now
gone
i
hope
never
to
return
when
each
thought
it
meritorious
not
only
to
damn
the
other
which
would
have
been
nothing
but
to
persecute
and
murther
one
another
for
the
glory
of
that
being
who
requires
no
more
of
us
than
that
we
should
love
one
another
and
live
every
one
goes
to
that
place
of
worship
which
he
likes
best
and
thinks
not
that
his
neighbour
does
wrong
by
not
following
him
each
busily
employed
in
their
temporal
affairs
is
less
vehement
about
spiritual
ones
and
fortunately
you
will
find
at
nantucket
neither
idle
drones
voluptuous
devotees
ranting
enthusiasts
nor
sour
demagogues
i
wish
i
had
it
in
my
power
to
send
the
most
persecuting
bigot
i
could
find
in
to
the
whale
fisheries
in
less
than
three
or
four
years
you
would
find
him
a
much
more
tractable
man
and
therefore
a
better
christian
singular
as
it
may
appear
to
you
there
are
but
two
medical
professors
on
the
island
for
of
what
service
can
physic
be
in
a
primitive
society
where
the
excesses
of
inebriation
are
so
rare
what
need
of
galenical
medicines
where
fevers
and
stomachs
loaded
by
the
loss
of
the
digestive
powers
are
so
few
temperance
the
calm
of
passions
frugality
and
continual
exercise
keep
them
healthy
and
preserve
unimpaired
that
constitution
which
they
have
received
from
parents
as
healthy
as
themselves
who
in
the
unpolluted
embraces
of
the
earliest
and
chastest
love
conveyed
to
them
the
soundest
bodily
frame
which
nature
could
give
but
as
no
habitable
part
of
this
globe
is
exempt
from
some
diseases
proceeding
either
from
climate
or
modes
of
living
here
they
are
sometimes
subject
to
consumptions
and
to
fevers
since
the
foundation
of
that
town
no
epidemical
distempers
have
appeared
which
at
times
cause
such
depopulations
in
other
countries
many
of
them
are
extremely
well
acquainted
with
the
indian
methods
of
curing
simple
diseases
and
practise
them
with
success
you
will
hardly
find
anywhere
a
community
composed
of
the
same
number
of
individuals
possessing
such
uninterrupted
health
and
exhibiting
so
many
green
old
men
who
show
their
advanced
age
by
the
maturity
of
their
wisdom
rather
than
by
the
wrinkles
of
their
faces
and
this
is
indeed
one
of
the
principal
blessings
of
the
island
which
richly
compensates
their
want
of
the
richer
soils
of
the
south
where
iliac
complaints
and
bilious
fevers
grow
by
the
side
of
the
sugar
cane
the
ambrosial
ananas
etc
the
situation
of
this
island
the
purity
of
the
air
the
nature
of
their
marine
occupations
their
virtue
and
moderation
are
the
causes
of
that
vigour
and
health
which
they
possess
the
poverty
of
their
soil
has
placed
them
i
hope
beyond
the
danger
of
conquest
or
the
wanton
desire
of
extirpation
were
they
to
be
driven
from
this
spot
the
only
acquisition
of
the
conquerors
would
be
a
few
acres
of
land
inclosed
and
cultivated
a
few
houses
and
some
movables
the
genius
the
industry
of
the
inhabitants
would
accompany
them
and
it
is
those
alone
which
constitute
the
sole
wealth
of
their
island
its
present
fame
would
perish
and
in
a
few
years
it
would
return
to
its
pristine
state
of
barrenness
and
poverty
they
might
perhaps
be
allowed
to
transport
themselves
in
their
own
vessels
to
some
other
spot
or
island
which
they
would
soon
fertilise
by
the
same
means
with
which
they
have
fertilised
this
one
single
lawyer
has
of
late
years
found
means
to
live
here
but
his
best
fortune
proceeds
more
from
having
married
one
of
the
wealthiest
heiresses
of
the
island
than
from
the
emoluments
of
his
practice
however
he
is
sometimes
employed
in
recovering
money
lent
on
the
main
or
in
preventing
those
accidents
to
which
the
contentious
propensity
of
its
inhabitants
may
sometimes
expose
them
he
is
seldom
employed
as
the
means
of
and
much
seldomer
as
the
channel
of
attack
to
which
they
are
strangers
except
the
fraud
is
manifest
and
the
danger
imminent
lawyers
are
so
numerous
in
all
our
populous
towns
that
i
am
surprised
they
never
thought
before
of
establishing
themselves
here
they
are
plants
that
will
grow
in
any
soil
that
is
cultivated
by
the
hands
of
others
and
when
once
they
have
taken
root
they
will
extinguish
every
other
vegetable
that
grows
around
them
the
fortunes
they
daily
acquire
in
every
province
from
the
misfortunes
of
their
are
surprising
the
most
ignorant
the
most
bungling
member
of
that
profession
will
if
placed
in
the
most
obscure
part
of
the
country
promote
litigiousness
and
amass
more
wealth
without
labour
than
the
most
opulent
farmer
with
all
his
toils
they
have
so
dexterously
interwoven
their
doctrines
and
quirks
with
the
laws
of
the
land
or
rather
they
are
become
so
necessary
an
evil
in
our
present
constitutions
that
it
seems
unavoidable
and
past
all
remedy
what
a
pity
that
our
forefathers
who
happily
extinguished
so
many
fatal
customs
and
expunged
from
their
new
government
so
many
errors
and
abuses
both
religious
and
civil
did
not
also
prevent
the
introduction
of
a
set
of
men
so
dangerous
in
some
provinces
where
every
inhabitant
is
constantly
employed
in
tilling
and
cultivating
the
earth
they
are
the
only
members
of
society
who
have
any
knowledge
let
these
provinces
attest
what
iniquitous
use
they
have
made
of
that
knowledge
they
are
here
what
the
clergy
were
in
past
centuries
with
you
the
reformation
which
clipped
the
clerical
wings
is
the
boast
of
that
age
and
the
happiest
event
that
could
possibly
happen
a
reformation
equally
useful
is
now
wanted
to
relieve
us
from
the
shameful
shackles
and
the
oppressive
burthen
under
which
we
groan
this
perhaps
is
impossible
but
if
mankind
would
not
become
too
happy
it
were
an
event
most
devoutly
to
be
wished
here
happily
unoppressed
with
any
civil
bondage
this
society
of
fishermen
and
merchants
live
without
any
military
establishments
without
governors
or
any
masters
but
the
laws
and
their
civil
code
is
so
light
that
it
is
never
felt
a
man
may
pass
as
many
have
done
whom
i
am
acquainted
with
through
the
various
scenes
of
a
long
life
may
struggle
against
a
variety
of
adverse
fortune
peaceably
enjoy
the
good
when
it
comes
and
never
in
that
long
interval
apply
to
the
law
either
for
redress
or
assistance
the
principal
benefit
it
confers
is
the
general
protection
of
individuals
and
this
protection
is
purchased
by
the
most
moderate
taxes
which
are
cheerfully
paid
and
by
the
trifling
duties
incident
in
the
course
of
their
lawful
trade
for
they
despise
contraband
nothing
can
be
more
simple
than
their
municipal
regulations
though
similar
to
those
of
the
other
counties
of
the
same
province
because
they
are
more
detached
from
the
rest
more
distinct
in
their
manners
as
well
as
in
the
nature
of
the
business
they
pursue
and
more
unconnected
with
the
populous
province
to
which
they
belong
the
same
simplicity
attends
the
worship
they
pay
to
the
divinity
their
elders
are
the
only
teachers
of
their
congregations
the
instructors
of
their
youth
and
often
the
example
of
their
flock
they
visit
and
comfort
the
sick
after
death
the
society
bury
them
with
their
fathers
without
pomp
prayers
or
ceremonies
not
a
stone
or
monument
is
erected
to
tell
where
any
person
was
buried
their
memory
is
preserved
by
tradition
the
only
essential
memorial
that
is
left
of
them
is
their
former
industry
their
kindness
their
charity
or
else
their
most
conspicuous
faults
the
presbyterians
live
in
great
charity
with
them
and
with
one
another
their
minister
as
a
true
pastor
of
the
gospel
inculcates
to
them
the
doctrines
it
contains
the
rewards
it
promises
the
punishments
it
holds
out
to
those
who
shall
commit
injustice
nothing
can
be
more
disencumbered
likewise
from
useless
ceremonies
and
trifling
forms
than
their
mode
of
worship
it
might
with
great
propriety
have
been
called
a
truly
primitive
one
had
that
of
the
quakers
never
appeared
as
fellow
christians
obeying
the
same
legislator
they
love
and
mutually
assist
each
other
in
all
their
wants
as
fellow
labourers
they
unite
with
cordiality
and
without
the
least
rancour
in
all
their
temporal
schemes
no
other
emulation
appears
among
them
but
in
their
sea
excursions
in
the
art
of
fitting
out
their
vessels
in
that
of
sailing
in
harpooning
the
whale
and
in
bringing
home
the
greatest
harvest
as
fellow
subjects
they
cheerfully
obey
the
same
laws
and
pay
the
same
duties
but
let
me
not
forget
another
peculiar
characteristic
of
this
community
there
is
not
a
slave
i
believe
on
the
whole
island
at
least
among
the
friends
whilst
slavery
prevails
all
around
them
this
society
alone
lamenting
that
shocking
insult
offered
to
humanity
have
given
the
world
a
singular
example
of
moderation
disinterestedness
and
christian
charity
in
emancipating
their
negroes
i
shall
explain
to
you
farther
the
singular
virtue
and
merit
to
which
it
is
so
justly
entitled
by
having
set
before
the
rest
of
their
subjects
so
pleasing
so
edifying
a
reformation
happy
the
people
who
are
subject
to
so
mild
a
government
happy
the
government
which
has
to
rule
over
such
harmless
and
such
industrious
subjects
while
we
are
clearing
forests
making
the
face
of
nature
smile
draining
marshes
cultivating
wheat
and
converting
it
into
flour
they
yearly
skim
from
the
surface
of
the
sea
riches
equally
necessary
thus
had
i
leisure
and
abilities
to
lead
you
through
this
continent
i
could
show
you
an
astonishing
prospect
very
little
known
in
europe
one
diffusive
scene
of
happiness
reaching
from
the
to
the
last
settlements
on
the
borders
of
the
wilderness
an
happiness
interrupted
only
by
the
folly
of
individuals
by
our
spirit
of
litigiousness
and
by
those
unforeseen
calamities
from
which
no
human
society
can
possibly
be
exempted
may
the
citizens
of
nantucket
dwell
long
here
in
uninterrupted
peace
undisturbed
either
by
the
waves
of
the
surrounding
element
or
the
political
commotions

letter
viii
peculiar
customs
at
nantucket
the
manners
of
the
friends
are
entirely
founded
on
that
simplicity
which
is
their
boast
and
their
most
distinguished
characteristic
and
those
manners
have
acquired
the
authority
of
laws
here
they
are
strongly
attached
to
plainness
of
dress
as
well
as
to
that
of
language
insomuch
that
though
some
part
of
it
may
be
ungrammatical
yet
should
any
person
who
was
born
and
brought
up
here
attempt
to
speak
more
correctly
he
would
be
looked
upon
as
a
fop
or
an
innovator
on
the
other
hand
should
a
stranger
come
here
and
adopt
their
idiom
in
all
its
purity
as
they
deem
it
this
accomplishment
would
immediately
procure
him
the
most
cordial
reception
and
they
would
cherish
him
like
an
ancient
member
of
their
society
so
many
impositions
have
they
suffered
on
this
account
that
they
begin
now
indeed
to
grow
more
cautious
they
are
so
tenacious
of
their
ancient
habits
of
industry
and
frugality
that
if
any
of
them
were
to
be
seen
with
a
long
coat
made
of
english
cloth
on
any
other
than
the
sunday
he
would
be
greatly
ridiculed
and
censured
he
would
be
looked
upon
as
a
careless
spendthrift
whom
it
would
be
unsafe
to
trust
and
in
vain
to
relieve
a
few
years
ago
two
horse
chairs
were
imported
from
boston
to
the
great
offence
of
these
prudent
citizens
nothing
appeared
to
them
more
culpable
than
the
use
of
such
gaudy
painted
vehicles
in
contempt
of
the
more
useful
and
more
simple
carts
of
their
fathers
this
piece
of
extravagant
and
unknown
luxury
almost
caused
a
schism
and
set
every
tongue
some
predicted
the
approaching
ruin
of
those
families
that
had
imported
them
others
feared
the
dangers
of
example
never
since
the
foundation
of
the
town
had
there
happened
anything
which
so
much
alarmed
this
primitive
community
one
of
the
possessors
of
these
profane
chairs
filled
with
repentance
wisely
sent
it
back
to
the
continent
the
other
more
obstinate
and
perverse
in
defiance
to
all
remonstrances
persisted
in
the
use
of
his
chair
until
by
degrees
they
became
more
reconciled
to
it
though
i
observed
that
the
wealthiest
and
the
most
respectable
people
still
go
to
meeting
or
to
their
farms
in
a
cart
with
a
decent
awning
fixed
over
it
indeed
if
you
consider
their
sandy
soil
and
the
badness
of
their
roads
these
appear
to
be
the
best
contrived
vehicles
for
this
island
idleness
is
the
most
heinous
sin
that
can
be
committed
in
nantucket
an
idle
man
would
soon
be
pointed
out
as
an
object
of
compassion
for
idleness
is
considered
as
another
word
for
want
and
hunger
this
principle
is
so
thoroughly
well
understood
and
is
become
so
universal
so
prevailing
a
prejudice
that
literally
speaking
they
are
never
idle
even
if
they
go
to
the
which
is
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
expression
the
of
the
town
either
to
transact
business
or
to
converse
with
their
friends
they
always
have
a
piece
of
cedar
in
their
hands
and
while
they
are
talking
they
will
as
it
were
instinctively
employ
themselves
in
converting
it
into
something
useful
either
in
making
bungs
or
spoyls
for
their
oil
casks
or
other
useful
articles
i
must
confess
that
i
have
never
seen
more
ingenuity
in
the
use
of
the
knife
thus
the
most
idle
moments
of
their
lives
become
usefully
employed
in
the
many
hours
of
leisure
which
their
long
cruises
afford
them
they
cut
and
carve
a
variety
of
boxes
and
pretty
toys
in
wood
adapted
to
different
uses
which
they
bring
home
as
testimonies
of
remembrance
to
their
wives
or
sweethearts
they
have
showed
me
a
variety
of
little
bowls
and
other
implements
executed
with
the
greatest
neatness
and
elegance
you
will
be
pleased
to
remember
they
are
all
brought
up
to
the
trade
of
coopers
be
their
future
intentions
or
fortunes
what
they
may
therefore
almost
every
man
in
this
island
has
always
two
knives
in
his
pocket
one
much
larger
than
the
other
and
though
they
hold
everything
that
is
called
fashion
in
the
utmost
contempt
yet
they
are
as
difficult
to
please
and
as
extravagant
in
the
choice
and
price
of
their
knives
as
any
young
buck
in
boston
would
be
about
his
hat
buckles
or
coat
as
soon
as
a
knife
is
injured
or
superseded
by
a
more
convenient
one
it
is
carefully
laid
up
in
some
corner
of
their
desk
i
once
saw
upwards
of
fifty
thus
preserved
at
one
of
the
worthiest
men
on
this
island
and
among
the
whole
there
was
not
one
that
perfectly
resembled
another
as
the
sea
excursions
are
often
very
long
their
wives
in
their
absence
are
necessarily
obliged
to
transact
business
to
settle
accounts
and
in
short
to
rule
and
provide
for
their
families
these
circumstances
being
often
repeated
give
women
the
abilities
as
well
as
a
taste
for
that
kind
of
superintendency
to
which
by
their
prudence
and
good
management
they
seem
to
be
in
general
very
equal
this
employment
ripens
their
judgment
and
justly
entitles
them
to
a
rank
superior
to
that
of
other
wives
and
this
is
the
principal
reason
why
those
of
nantucket
as
well
as
those
of
montreal
footnote
most
of
the
merchants
and
young
men
of
montreal
spend
the
greatest
part
of
their
time
in
trading
with
the
indians
at
an
amazing
distance
from
canada
and
it
often
happens
that
they
are
three
years
together
absent
from
home
are
so
fond
of
society
so
affable
and
so
conversant
with
the
affairs
of
the
world
the
men
at
their
return
weary
with
the
fatigues
of
the
sea
full
of
confidence
and
love
cheerfully
give
their
consent
to
every
transaction
that
has
happened
during
their
absence
and
all
is
joy
and
peace
wife
thee
hast
done
well
is
the
general
approbation
they
receive
for
their
application
and
industry
what
would
the
men
do
without
the
agency
of
these
faithful
mates
the
absence
of
so
many
of
them
at
particular
seasons
leaves
the
town
quite
desolate
and
this
mournful
situation
disposes
the
women
to
go
to
each
other
house
much
oftener
than
when
their
husbands
are
at
home
hence
the
custom
of
incessant
visiting
has
infected
every
one
and
even
those
whose
husbands
do
not
go
abroad
the
house
is
always
cleaned
before
they
set
out
and
with
peculiar
alacrity
they
pursue
their
intended
visit
which
consists
of
a
social
chat
a
dish
of
tea
and
an
hearty
supper
when
the
good
man
of
the
house
returns
from
his
labour
he
peaceably
goes
after
his
wife
and
brings
her
home
meanwhile
the
young
fellows
equally
vigilant
easily
find
out
which
is
the
most
convenient
house
and
there
they
assemble
with
the
girls
of
the
neighbourhood
instead
of
cards
musical
instruments
or
songs
they
relate
stories
of
their
whaling
voyages
their
various
sea
adventures
and
talk
of
the
different
coasts
and
people
they
have
visited
the
island
of
catharine
in
the
brazil
says
one
is
a
very
droll
island
it
is
inhabited
by
none
but
men
women
are
not
permitted
to
come
in
sight
of
it
not
a
woman
is
there
on
the
whole
island
who
among
us
is
not
glad
it
is
not
so
here
the
nantucket
girls
and
boys
beat
the
world
at
this
innocent
sally
the
titter
goes
round
they
whisper
to
one
another
their
spontaneous
reflections
puddings
pies
and
custards
never
fail
to
be
produced
on
such
occasions
for
i
believe
there
never
were
any
people
in
their
circumstances
who
live
so
well
even
to
superabundance
as
inebriation
is
unknown
and
music
singing
and
dancing
are
held
in
equal
detestation
they
never
could
fill
all
the
vacant
hours
of
their
lives
without
the
repast
of
the
table
thus
these
young
people
sit
and
talk
and
divert
themselves
as
well
as
they
can
if
any
one
has
lately
returned
from
a
cruise
he
is
generally
the
speaker
of
the
night
they
often
all
laugh
and
talk
together
but
they
are
happy
and
would
not
exchange
their
pleasures
for
those
of
the
most
brilliant
assemblies
in
europe
this
lasts
until
the
father
and
mother
return
when
all
retire
to
their
respective
homes
the
men
the
partners
of
their
affections
thus
they
spend
many
of
the
youthful
evenings
of
their
lives
no
wonder
therefore
that
they
marry
so
early
but
no
sooner
have
they
undergone
this
ceremony
than
they
cease
to
appear
so
cheerful
and
gay
the
new
rank
they
hold
in
the
society
impresses
them
with
more
serious
ideas
than
were
entertained
before
the
title
of
master
of
a
family
necessarily
requires
more
solid
behaviour
and
deportment
the
new
wife
follows
in
the
trammels
of
custom
which
are
as
powerful
as
the
tyranny
of
fashion
she
gradually
advises
and
directs
the
new
husband
soon
goes
to
sea
he
leaves
her
to
learn
and
exercise
the
new
government
in
which
she
is
entered
those
who
stay
at
home
are
full
as
passive
in
general
at
least
with
regard
to
the
inferior
departments
of
the
family
but
you
must
not
imagine
from
this
account
that
the
nantucket
wives
are
turbulent
of
high
temper
and
difficult
to
be
ruled
on
the
contrary
the
wives
of
sherburn
in
so
doing
comply
only
with
the
prevailing
custom
of
the
island
the
husbands
equally
submissive
to
the
ancient
and
respectable
manners
of
their
country
submit
without
ever
suspecting
that
there
can
be
any
impropriety
were
they
to
behave
otherwise
they
would
be
afraid
of
subverting
the
principles
of
their
society
by
altering
its
ancient
rules
thus
both
parties
are
perfectly
satisfied
and
all
is
peace
and
concord
the
richest
person
now
in
the
island
owes
all
his
present
prosperity
and
success
to
the
ingenuity
of
his
wife
this
is
a
known
fact
which
is
well
recorded
for
while
he
was
performing
his
first
cruises
she
traded
with
pins
and
needles
and
kept
a
school
afterward
she
purchased
more
considerable
articles
which
she
sold
with
so
much
judgment
that
she
laid
the
foundation
of
a
system
of
business
that
she
has
ever
since
prosecuted
with
equal
dexterity
and
success
she
wrote
to
london
formed
connections
and
in
short
became
the
only
ostensible
instrument
of
that
house
both
at
home
and
abroad
who
is
he
in
this
country
and
who
is
a
citizen
of
nantucket
or
boston
who
does
not
know
aunt
kesiah
i
must
tell
you
that
she
is
the
wife
of
c
n
a
very
respectable
man
who
well
pleased
with
all
her
schemes
trusts
to
her
judgment
and
relies
on
her
sagacity
with
so
entire
a
confidence
as
to
be
altogether
passive
to
the
concerns
of
his
family
they
have
the
best
country
seat
on
the
island
at
quayes
where
they
live
with
hospitality
and
in
perfect
union
he
seems
to
be
altogether
the
contemplative
man
to
this
dexterity
in
managing
the
husband
business
whilst
he
is
absent
the
nantucket
wives
unite
a
great
deal
of
industry
they
spin
or
cause
to
be
spun
in
their
houses
abundance
of
wool
and
flax
and
would
be
for
ever
disgraced
and
looked
upon
as
idlers
if
all
the
family
were
not
clad
in
good
neat
and
sufficient
cloth
first
days
are
the
only
seasons
when
it
is
lawful
for
both
sexes
to
exhibit
some
garments
of
english
manufacture
even
these
are
of
the
most
moderate
price
and
of
the
gravest
colours
there
is
no
kind
of
difference
in
their
dress
they
are
all
clad
alike
and
resemble
in
that
respect
the
members
of
one
family
a
singular
custom
prevails
here
among
the
women
at
which
i
was
greatly
surprised
and
am
really
at
a
loss
how
to
account
for
the
original
cause
that
has
introduced
in
this
primitive
society
so
remarkable
a
fashion
or
rather
so
extraordinary
a
want
they
have
adopted
these
many
years
the
asiatic
custom
of
taking
a
dose
of
opium
every
morning
and
so
deeply
rooted
is
it
that
they
would
be
at
a
loss
how
to
live
without
this
indulgence
they
would
rather
be
deprived
of
any
necessary
than
forego
their
favourite
luxury
this
is
much
more
prevailing
among
the
women
than
the
men
few
of
the
latter
having
caught
the
contagion
though
the
sheriff
whom
i
may
call
the
first
person
in
the
island
who
is
an
eminent
physician
beside
and
whom
i
had
the
pleasure
of
being
well
acquainted
with
has
for
many
years
submitted
to
this
custom
he
takes
three
grains
of
it
every
day
after
breakfast
without
the
effects
of
which
he
often
told
me
he
was
not
able
to
transact
any
business
it
is
hard
to
conceive
how
a
people
always
happy
and
healthy
in
consequence
of
the
exercise
and
labour
they
undergo
never
oppressed
with
the
vapours
of
idleness
yet
should
want
the
fictitious
effects
of
opium
to
preserve
that
cheerfulness
to
which
their
temperance
their
climate
their
happy
situation
so
justly
entitle
them
but
where
is
the
society
perfectly
free
from
error
or
folly
the
least
imperfect
is
undoubtedly
that
where
the
greatest
good
preponderates
and
agreeable
to
this
rule
i
can
truly
say
that
i
never
was
acquainted
with
a
less
vicious
or
more
harmless
one
the
majority
of
the
present
inhabitants
are
the
descendants
of
the
first
proprietors
who
patenteed
the
island
of
the
rest
many
others
have
since
come
over
among
them
chiefly
from
the
massachusetts
here
are
neither
scotch
irish
nor
french
as
is
the
case
in
most
other
settlements
they
are
an
unmixed
english
breed
the
consequence
of
this
extended
connection
is
that
they
are
all
in
some
degree
related
to
each
other
you
must
not
be
surprised
therefore
when
i
tell
you
that
they
always
call
each
other
cousin
uncle
or
aunt
which
are
become
such
common
appellations
that
no
other
are
made
use
of
in
their
daily
intercourse
you
would
be
deemed
stiff
and
affected
were
you
to
refuse
conforming
yourself
to
this
ancient
custom
which
truly
depicts
the
image
of
a
large
family
the
many
who
reside
here
that
have
not
the
least
claim
of
relationship
with
any
one
in
the
town
yet
by
the
power
of
custom
make
use
of
no
other
address
in
their
conversation
were
you
here
yourself
but
a
few
days
you
would
be
obliged
to
adopt
the
same
phraseology
which
is
far
from
being
disagreeable
as
it
implies
a
general
acquaintance
and
friendship
which
connects
them
all
in
unity
and
peace
their
taste
for
fishing
has
been
so
prevailing
that
it
has
engrossed
all
their
attention
and
even
prevented
them
from
introducing
some
higher
degree
of
perfection
in
their
agriculture
there
are
many
useful
improvements
which
might
have
meliorated
their
soil
there
are
many
trees
which
if
transplanted
here
would
have
thriven
extremely
well
and
would
have
served
to
shelter
as
well
as
decorate
the
favourite
spots
they
have
so
carefully
manured
the
red
cedar
the
locust
footnote
a
species
of
what
we
call
here
the
acacia
it
yields
the
most
valuable
timber
we
have
and
its
shade
is
very
beneficial
to
the
growth
and
goodness
of
the
grass
the
button
wood
i
am
persuaded
would
have
grown
here
rapidly
and
to
a
great
size
with
many
others
but
their
thoughts
are
turned
altogether
toward
the
sea
the
indian
corn
begins
to
yield
them
considerable
crops
and
the
wheat
sown
on
its
stocks
is
become
a
very
profitable
grain
rye
will
grow
with
little
care
they
might
raise
if
they
would
an
immense
quantity
of
such
an
island
inhabited
as
i
have
described
is
not
the
place
where
gay
travellers
should
resort
in
order
to
enjoy
that
variety
of
pleasures
the
more
splendid
towns
of
this
continent
afford
not
that
they
are
wholly
deprived
of
what
we
might
call
recreations
and
innocent
pastimes
but
opulence
instead
of
luxuries
and
extravagancies
produces
nothing
more
here
than
an
increase
of
business
an
additional
degree
of
hospitality
greater
neatness
in
the
preparation
of
dishes
and
better
wines
they
often
walk
and
converse
with
each
other
as
i
have
observed
before
and
upon
extraordinary
occasions
will
take
a
ride
to
palpus
where
there
is
an
house
of
entertainment
but
these
rural
amusements
are
conducted
upon
the
same
plan
of
moderation
as
those
in
town
they
are
so
simple
as
hardly
to
be
described
the
pleasure
of
going
and
returning
together
of
chatting
and
walking
about
of
throwing
the
bar
heaving
stones
are
the
only
entertainments
they
are
acquainted
with
this
is
all
they
practise
and
all
they
seem
to
desire
the
house
at
palpus
is
the
general
resort
of
those
who
possess
the
luxury
of
a
horse
and
chaise
as
well
as
of
those
who
still
retain
as
the
majority
do
a
predilection
for
their
primitive
vehicle
by
resorting
to
that
place
they
enjoy
a
change
of
air
they
taste
the
pleasures
of
exercise
perhaps
an
exhilarating
bowl
not
at
all
improper
in
this
climate
affords
the
chief
indulgence
known
to
these
people
on
the
days
of
their
greatest
festivity
the
mounting
a
horse
must
afford
a
most
pleasing
exercise
to
those
men
who
are
so
much
at
sea
i
was
once
invited
to
that
house
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
conducting
thither
one
of
the
many
beauties
of
that
island
for
it
abounds
with
handsome
women
dressed
in
all
the
bewitching
attire
of
the
most
charming
simplicity
like
the
rest
of
the
company
she
was
cheerful
without
loud
laughs
and
smiling
without
affectation
they
all
appeared
gay
without
levity
i
had
never
before
in
my
life
seen
so
much
unaffected
mirth
mixed
with
so
much
modesty
the
pleasures
of
the
day
were
enjoyed
with
the
greatest
liveliness
and
the
most
innocent
freedom
no
disgusting
pruderies
no
coquettish
airs
tarnished
this
enlivening
assembly
they
behaved
according
to
their
native
dispositions
the
only
rules
of
decorum
with
which
they
were
acquainted
what
would
an
european
visitor
have
done
here
without
a
fiddle
without
a
dance
without
cards
he
would
have
called
it
an
insipid
assembly
and
ranked
this
among
the
dullest
days
he
bad
ever
spent
this
rural
excursion
had
a
very
great
affinity
to
those
practised
in
our
province
with
this
difference
only
that
we
have
no
objection
to
the
sportive
dance
though
conducted
by
the
rough
accents
of
some
african
fiddler
we
returned
as
happy
as
we
went
and
the
brightness
of
the
moon
kindly
lengthened
a
day
which
had
past
like
other
agreeable
ones
with
singular
rapidity
in
order
to
view
the
island
in
its
longest
direction
from
the
town
i
took
a
ride
to
the
easternmost
parts
of
it
remarkable
only
for
the
pochick
rip
where
their
best
fish
are
caught
i
past
by
the
tetoukemah
lots
which
are
the
fields
of
the
community
the
fences
were
made
of
cedar
posts
and
rails
and
looked
perfectly
straight
and
neat
the
various
crops
they
enclosed
were
flourishing
thence
i
descended
into
barrey
valley
where
the
blue
and
the
spear
grass
looked
more
abundant
than
i
had
seen
on
any
other
part
of
the
island
thence
to
gib
pond
and
arrived
at
last
at
siasconcet
several
dwellings
had
been
erected
on
this
wild
shore
for
the
purpose
of
sheltering
the
fishermen
in
the
season
of
fishing
i
found
them
all
empty
except
that
particular
one
to
which
i
had
been
directed
it
was
like
the
others
built
on
the
highest
part
of
the
shore
in
the
face
of
the
great
ocean
the
soil
appeared
to
be
composed
of
no
other
stratum
but
sand
covered
with
a
thinly
scattered
herbage
what
rendered
this
house
still
more
worthy
of
notice
in
my
eyes
was
that
it
had
been
built
on
the
ruins
of
one
of
the
ancient
huts
erected
by
the
first
settlers
for
observing
the
appearance
of
the
whales
here
lived
a
single
family
without
a
neighbour
i
had
never
before
seen
a
spot
better
calculated
to
cherish
contemplative
ideas
perfectly
unconnected
with
the
great
world
and
far
removed
from
its
perturbations
the
ever
raging
ocean
was
all
that
presented
itself
to
the
view
of
this
family
it
irresistibly
attracted
my
whole
attention
my
eyes
were
involuntarily
directed
to
the
horizontal
line
of
that
watery
surface
which
is
ever
in
motion
and
ever
threatening
destruction
to
these
shores
my
ears
were
stunned
with
the
roar
of
its
waves
rolling
one
over
the
other
as
if
impelled
by
a
superior
force
to
overwhelm
the
spot
on
which
i
stood
my
nostrils
involuntarily
inhaled
the
saline
vapours
which
arose
from
the
dispersed
particles
of
the
foaming
billows
or
from
the
weeds
scattered
on
the
shores
my
mind
suggested
a
thousand
vague
reflections
pleasing
in
the
hour
of
their
spontaneous
birth
but
now
half
forgot
and
all
indistinct
and
who
is
the
landman
that
can
behold
without
affright
so
singular
an
element
which
by
its
impetuosity
seems
to
be
the
destroyer
of
this
poor
planet
yet
at
particular
times
accumulates
the
scattered
fragments
and
produces
islands
and
continents
fit
for
men
to
dwell
on
who
can
observe
the
regular
vicissitudes
of
its
waters
without
astonishment
now
swelling
themselves
in
order
to
penetrate
through
every
river
and
opening
and
thereby
facilitate
navigation
at
other
times
retiring
from
the
shores
to
permit
man
to
collect
that
variety
of
shell
fish
which
is
the
support
of
the
poor
who
can
see
the
storms
of
wind
blowing
sometimes
with
an
impetuosity
sufficiently
strong
even
to
move
the
earth
without
feeling
himself
affected
beyond
the
sphere
of
common
ideas
can
this
wind
which
but
a
few
days
ago
refreshed
our
american
fields
and
cooled
us
in
the
shade
be
the
same
element
which
now
and
then
so
powerfully
convulses
the
waters
of
the
sea
dismasts
vessels
causes
so
many
shipwrecks
and
such
extensive
desolations
how
diminutive
does
a
man
appear
to
himself
when
filled
with
these
thoughts
and
standing
as
i
did
on
the
verge
of
the
ocean
this
family
lived
entirely
by
fishing
for
the
plough
has
not
dared
yet
to
disturb
the
parched
surface
of
the
neighbouring
plain
and
to
what
purpose
could
this
operation
be
performed
where
is
it
that
mankind
will
not
find
safety
peace
and
abundance
with
freedom
and
civil
happiness
nothing
was
wanting
here
to
make
this
a
most
philosophical
retreat
but
a
few
ancient
trees
to
shelter
contemplation
in
its
beloved
solitude
there
i
saw
a
numerous
family
of
children
of
various
blessings
of
an
early
marriage
they
were
ruddy
as
the
cherry
healthy
as
the
fish
they
lived
on
hardy
as
the
pine
knots
the
eldest
were
already
able
to
encounter
the
boisterous
waves
and
shuddered
not
at
their
approach
early
initiating
themselves
in
the
mysteries
of
that
seafaring
career
for
which
they
were
all
intended
the
younger
timid
as
yet
on
the
edge
of
a
less
agitated
pool
were
teaching
themselves
with
and
pieces
of
wood
in
imitation
of
boats
how
to
navigate
in
a
future
day
the
larger
vessels
of
their
father
through
a
rougher
and
deeper
ocean
i
stayed
two
days
there
on
purpose
to
become
acquainted
with
the
different
branches
of
their
economy
and
their
manner
of
living
in
this
singular
retreat
the
clams
the
oysters
of
the
shores
with
the
addition
of
indian
dumplings
footnote
indian
dumplings
are
a
peculiar
preparation
of
indian
meal
boiled
in
large
lumps
constituted
their
daily
and
most
substantial
food
larger
fish
were
often
caught
on
the
neighbouring
rip
these
afforded
them
their
greatest
dainties
they
had
likewise
plenty
of
smoked
bacon
the
noise
of
the
wheels
announced
the
industry
of
the
mother
and
daughters
one
of
them
had
been
bred
a
weaver
and
having
a
loom
in
the
house
found
means
of
clothing
the
whole
family
they
were
perfectly
at
ease
and
seemed
to
want
for
nothing
i
found
very
few
books
among
these
people
who
have
very
little
time
for
reading
the
bible
and
a
few
school
tracts
both
in
the
nattick
and
english
languages
constituted
their
most
numerous
libraries
i
saw
indeed
several
copies
of
hudibras
and
josephus
but
no
one
knows
who
first
imported
them
it
is
something
extraordinary
to
see
this
people
professedly
so
grave
and
strangers
to
every
branch
of
literature
reading
with
pleasure
the
former
work
which
should
seem
to
require
some
degree
of
taste
and
antecedent
historical
knowledge
they
all
read
it
much
and
can
by
memory
repeat
many
passages
which
yet
i
could
not
discover
that
they
understood
the
beauties
of
is
it
not
a
little
singular
to
see
these
books
in
the
hands
of
fishermen
who
are
perfect
strangers
almost
to
any
other
josephus
history
is
indeed
intelligible
and
much
fitter
for
their
modes
of
education
and
taste
as
it
describes
the
history
of
a
people
from
whom
we
have
received
the
prophecies
which
we
believe
and
the
religious
laws
which
we
follow
learned
travellers
returned
from
seeing
the
paintings
and
antiquities
of
rome
and
italy
still
filled
with
the
admiration
and
reverence
they
inspire
would
hardly
be
persuaded
that
so
contemptible
a
spot
which
contains
nothing
remarkable
but
the
genius
and
the
industry
of
its
inhabitants
could
ever
be
an
object
worthy
attention
but
i
having
never
seen
the
beauties
which
europe
contains
cheerfully
satisfy
myself
with
attentively
examining
what
my
native
country
exhibits
if
we
have
neither
ancient
amphitheatres
gilded
palaces
nor
elevated
spires
we
enjoy
in
our
woods
a
substantial
happiness
which
the
wonders
of
art
can
not
communicate
none
among
us
suffer
oppression
either
from
government
or
religion
there
are
very
few
poor
except
the
idle
and
fortunately
the
force
of
example
and
the
most
ample
encouragement
soon
create
a
new
principle
of
activity
which
had
been
extinguished
perhaps
in
their
native
country
for
want
of
those
opportunities
which
so
often
compel
honest
europeans
to
seek
shelter
among
us
the
means
of
procuring
subsistence
in
europe
are
limited
the
army
may
be
full
the
navy
may
abound
with
seamen
the
land
perhaps
wants
no
additional
labourers
the
manufacturer
is
overcharged
with
supernumerary
hands
what
then
must
become
of
the
unemployed
here
on
the
contrary
human
industry
has
acquired
a
boundless
field
to
exert
itself
in
a
field
which
will
not
be
fully
cultivated
in
many
ages
letter

description
of
thoughts
on
slavery
on
physical
evil
a
melancholy
scene
is
in
the
north
what
lima
is
in
the
south
both
are
capitals
of
the
richest
provinces
of
their
respective
hemispheres
you
may
therefore
conjecture
that
both
cities
must
exhibit
the
appearances
necessarily
resulting
from
riches
peru
abounding
in
gold
lima
is
filled
with
inhabitants
who
enjoy
all
those
gradations
of
pleasure
refinement
and
luxury
which
proceed
from
wealth
carolina
produces
commodities
more
valuable
perhaps
than
gold
because
they
are
gained
by
greater
industry
it
exhibits
also
on
our
northern
stage
a
display
of
riches
and
luxury
inferior
indeed
to
the
former
but
far
superior
to
what
are
to
be
seen
in
our
northern
towns
its
situation
is
admirable
being
built
at
the
confluence
of
two
large
rivers
which
receive
in
their
course
a
great
number
of
inferior
streams
all
navigable
in
the
spring
for
flat
boats
here
the
produce
of
this
extensive
territory
concentres
here
therefore
is
the
seat
of
the
most
valuable
exportation
their
wharfs
their
docks
their
magazines
are
extremely
convenient
to
facilitate
this
great
commercial
business
the
inhabitants
are
the
gayest
in
america
it
is
called
the
centre
of
our
beau
monde
and
is
always
filled
with
the
richest
planters
of
the
province
who
resort
hither
in
quest
of
health
and
pleasure
here
are
always
to
be
seen
a
great
number
of
valetudinarians
from
the
west
indies
seeking
for
the
renovation
of
health
exhausted
by
the
debilitating
nature
of
their
sun
air
and
modes
of
living
many
of
these
west
indians
have
i
seen
at
thirty
loaded
with
the
infirmities
of
old
age
for
nothing
is
more
common
in
those
countries
of
wealth
than
for
persons
to
lose
the
abilities
of
enjoying
the
comforts
of
life
at
a
time
when
we
northern
men
just
begin
to
taste
the
fruits
of
our
labour
and
prudence
the
round
of
pleasure
and
the
expenses
of
those
tables
are
much
superior
to
what
you
would
imagine
indeed
the
growth
of
this
town
and
province
has
been
astonishingly
rapid
it
is
pity
that
the
narrowness
of
the
neck
on
which
it
stands
prevents
it
from
increasing
and
which
is
the
reason
why
houses
are
so
dear
the
heat
of
the
climate
which
is
sometimes
very
great
in
the
interior
parts
of
the
country
is
always
temperate
in
though
sometimes
when
they
have
no
sea
breezes
the
sun
is
too
powerful
the
climate
renders
excesses
of
all
kinds
very
dangerous
particularly
those
of
the
table
and
yet
insensible
or
fearless
of
danger
they
live
on
and
enjoy
a
short
and
a
merry
life
the
rays
of
their
sun
seem
to
urge
them
irresistibly
to
dissipation
and
pleasure
on
the
contrary
the
women
from
being
abstemious
reach
to
a
longer
period
of
life
and
seldom
die
without
having
had
several
husbands
an
european
at
his
first
arrival
must
be
greatly
surprised
when
he
sees
the
elegance
of
their
houses
their
sumptuous
furniture
as
well
as
the
magnificence
of
their
tables
can
he
imagine
himself
in
a
country
the
establishment
of
which
is
so
recent
the
three
principal
classes
of
inhabitants
are
lawyers
planters
and
merchants
this
is
the
province
which
has
afforded
to
the
first
the
richest
spoils
for
nothing
can
exceed
their
wealth
their
power
and
their
influence
they
have
reached
the
ne
plus
ultra
of
worldly
felicity
no
plantation
is
secured
no
title
is
good
no
will
is
valid
but
what
they
dictate
regulate
and
approve
the
whole
mass
of
provincial
property
is
become
tributary
to
this
society
which
far
above
priests
and
bishops
disdain
to
be
satisfied
with
the
poor
mosaical
portion
of
the
tenth
i
appeal
to
the
many
inhabitants
who
while
contending
perhaps
for
their
right
to
a
few
hundred
acres
have
lost
by
the
mazes
of
the
law
their
whole
patrimony
these
men
are
more
properly
law
givers
than
interpreters
of
the
law
and
have
united
here
as
well
as
in
most
other
provinces
the
skill
and
dexterity
of
the
scribe
with
the
power
and
ambition
of
the
prince
who
can
tell
where
this
may
lead
in
a
future
day
the
nature
of
our
laws
and
the
spirit
of
freedom
which
often
tends
to
make
us
litigious
must
necessarily
throw
the
greatest
part
of
the
property
of
the
colonies
into
the
hands
of
these
gentlemen
in
another
century
the
law
will
possess
in
the
north
what
now
the
church
possesses
in
peru
and
mexico
while
all
is
joy
festivity
and
happiness
in
would
you
imagine
that
scenes
of
misery
overspread
in
the
country
their
ears
by
habit
are
become
deaf
their
hearts
are
hardened
they
neither
see
hear
nor
feel
for
the
woes
of
their
poor
slaves
from
whose
painful
labours
all
their
wealth
proceeds
here
the
horrors
of
slavery
the
hardship
of
incessant
toils
are
unseen
and
no
one
thinks
with
compassion
of
those
showers
of
sweat
and
of
tears
which
from
the
bodies
of
africans
daily
drop
and
moisten
the
ground
they
till
the
cracks
of
the
whip
urging
these
miserable
beings
to
excessive
labour
are
far
too
distant
from
the
gay
capital
to
be
heard
the
chosen
race
eat
drink
and
live
happy
while
the
unfortunate
one
grubs
up
the
ground
raises
indigo
or
husks
the
rice
exposed
to
a
sun
full
as
scorching
as
their
native
one
without
the
support
of
good
food
without
the
cordials
of
any
cheering
liquor
this
great
contrast
has
often
afforded
me
subjects
of
the
most
conflicting
meditation
on
the
one
side
behold
a
people
enjoying
all
that
life
affords
most
bewitching
and
pleasurable
without
labour
without
fatigue
hardly
subjected
to
the
trouble
of
wishing
with
gold
dug
from
peruvian
mountains
they
order
vessels
to
the
coasts
of
guinea
by
virtue
of
that
gold
wars
murders
and
devastations
are
committed
in
some
harmless
peaceable
african
neighbourhood
where
dwelt
innocent
people
who
even
knew
not
but
that
all
men
were
black
the
daughter
torn
from
her
weeping
mother
the
child
from
the
wretched
parents
the
wife
from
the
loving
husband
whole
families
swept
away
and
brought
through
storms
and
tempests
to
this
rich
metropolis
there
arranged
like
horses
at
a
fair
they
are
branded
like
cattle
and
then
driven
to
toil
to
starve
and
to
languish
for
a
few
years
on
the
different
plantations
of
these
citizens
and
for
whom
must
they
work
for
persons
they
know
not
and
who
have
no
other
power
over
them
than
that
of
violence
no
other
right
than
what
this
accursed
metal
has
given
them
strange
order
of
things
oh
nature
where
art
thou
are
not
these
blacks
thy
children
as
well
as
we
on
the
other
side
nothing
is
to
be
seen
but
the
most
diffusive
misery
and
wretchedness
unrelieved
even
in
thought
or
wish
day
after
day
they
drudge
on
without
any
prospect
of
ever
reaping
for
themselves
they
are
obliged
to
devote
their
lives
their
limbs
their
will
and
every
vital
exertion
to
swell
the
wealth
of
masters
who
look
not
upon
them
with
half
the
kindness
and
affection
with
which
they
consider
their
dogs
and
horses
kindness
and
affection
are
not
the
portion
of
those
who
till
the
earth
who
carry
the
burdens
who
convert
the
logs
into
useful
boards
this
reward
simple
and
natural
as
one
would
conceive
it
would
border
on
humanity
and
planters
must
have
none
of
it
if
negroes
are
permitted
to
become
fathers
this
fatal
indulgence
only
tends
to
increase
their
misery
the
poor
companions
of
their
scanty
pleasures
are
likewise
the
companions
of
their
labours
and
when
at
some
critical
seasons
they
could
wish
to
see
them
relieved
with
tears
in
their
eyes
they
behold
them
perhaps
doubly
oppressed
obliged
to
bear
the
burden
of
nature
a
fatal
present
as
well
as
that
of
unabated
tasks
how
many
have
i
seen
cursing
the
irresistible
propensity
and
regretting
that
by
having
tasted
of
those
harmless
joys
they
had
become
the
authors
of
double
misery
to
their
wives
like
their
masters
they
are
not
permitted
to
partake
of
those
ineffable
sensations
with
which
nature
inspires
the
hearts
of
fathers
and
mothers
they
must
repel
them
all
and
become
callous
and
passive
this
unnatural
state
often
occasions
the
most
acute
the
most
pungent
of
their
afflictions
they
have
no
time
like
us
tenderly
to
rear
their
helpless
to
nurse
them
on
their
knees
to
enjoy
the
delight
of
being
parents
their
paternal
fondness
is
embittered
by
considering
that
if
their
children
live
they
must
live
to
be
slaves
like
themselves
no
time
is
allowed
them
to
exercise
their
pious
office
the
mothers
must
fasten
them
on
their
backs
and
with
this
double
load
follow
their
husbands
in
the
fields
where
they
too
often
hear
no
other
sound
than
that
of
the
voice
or
whip
of
the
taskmaster
and
the
cries
of
their
infants
broiling
in
the
sun
these
unfortunate
creatures
cry
and
weep
like
their
parents
without
a
possibility
of
relief
the
very
instinct
of
the
brute
so
laudable
so
irresistible
runs
counter
here
to
their
master
interest
and
to
that
god
all
the
laws
of
nature
must
give
way
thus
planters
get
rich
so
raw
so
unexperienced
am
i
in
this
mode
of
life
that
were
i
to
be
possessed
of
a
plantation
and
my
slaves
treated
as
in
general
they
are
here
never
could
i
rest
in
peace
my
sleep
would
be
perpetually
disturbed
by
a
retrospect
of
the
frauds
committed
in
africa
in
order
to
entrap
them
frauds
surpassing
in
enormity
everything
which
a
common
mind
can
possibly
conceive
i
should
be
thinking
of
the
barbarous
treatment
they
meet
with
on
of
their
anguish
of
the
despair
necessarily
inspired
by
their
situation
when
torn
from
their
friends
and
relations
when
delivered
into
the
hands
of
a
people
differently
coloured
whom
they
can
not
understand
carried
in
a
strange
machine
over
an
ever
agitated
element
which
they
had
never
seen
before
and
finally
delivered
over
to
the
severities
of
the
whippers
and
the
excessive
labours
of
the
field
can
it
be
possible
that
the
force
of
custom
should
ever
make
me
deaf
to
all
these
reflections
and
as
insensible
to
the
injustice
of
that
trade
and
to
their
miseries
as
the
rich
inhabitants
of
this
town
seem
to
be
what
then
is
man
this
being
who
boasts
so
much
of
the
excellence
and
dignity
of
his
nature
among
that
variety
of
unscrutable
mysteries
of
unsolvable
problems
with
which
he
is
surrounded
the
reason
why
man
has
been
thus
created
is
not
the
least
astonishing
it
is
said
i
know
that
they
are
much
happier
here
than
in
the
west
indies
because
land
being
cheaper
upon
this
continent
than
in
those
islands
the
fields
allowed
them
to
raise
their
subsistence
from
are
in
general
more
extensive
the
only
possible
chance
of
any
alleviation
depends
on
the
humour
of
the
planters
who
bred
in
the
midst
of
slaves
learn
from
the
example
of
their
parents
to
despise
them
and
seldom
conceive
either
from
religion
or
philosophy
any
ideas
that
tend
to
make
their
fate
less
calamitous
except
some
strong
native
tenderness
of
heart
some
rays
of
philanthropy
overcome
the
obduracy
contracted
by
habit
i
have
not
resided
here
long
enough
to
become
insensible
of
pain
for
the
objects
which
i
every
day
behold
in
the
choice
of
my
friends
and
acquaintance
i
always
endeavour
to
find
out
those
whose
dispositions
are
somewhat
congenial
with
my
own
we
have
slaves
likewise
in
our
northern
provinces
i
hope
the
time
draws
near
when
they
will
be
all
emancipated
but
how
different
their
lot
how
different
their
situation
in
every
possible
respect
they
enjoy
as
much
liberty
as
their
masters
they
are
as
well
clad
and
as
well
fed
in
health
and
sickness
they
are
tenderly
taken
care
of
they
live
under
the
same
roof
and
are
truly
speaking
a
part
of
our
families
many
of
them
are
taught
to
read
and
write
and
are
well
instructed
in
the
principles
of
religion
they
are
the
companions
of
our
labours
and
treated
as
such
they
enjoy
many
perquisites
many
established
holidays
and
are
not
obliged
to
work
more
than
white
people
they
marry
where
inclination
leads
them
visit
their
wives
every
week
are
as
decently
clad
as
the
common
people
they
are
indulged
in
educating
cherishing
and
chastising
their
children
who
are
taught
subordination
to
them
as
to
their
lawful
parents
in
short
they
participate
in
many
of
the
benefits
of
our
society
without
being
obliged
to
bear
any
of
its
burdens
they
are
fat
healthy
and
hearty
and
far
from
repining
at
their
fate
they
think
themselves
happier
than
many
of
the
lower
class
whites
they
share
with
their
masters
the
wheat
and
meat
provision
they
help
to
raise
many
of
those
whom
the
good
quakers
have
emancipated
have
received
that
great
benefit
with
tears
of
regret
and
have
never
quitted
though
free
their
former
masters
and
benefactors
but
is
it
really
true
as
i
have
heard
it
asserted
here
that
those
blacks
are
incapable
of
feeling
the
spurs
of
emulation
and
the
cheerful
sound
of
encouragement
by
no
means
there
are
a
thousand
proofs
existing
of
their
gratitude
and
fidelity
those
hearts
in
which
such
noble
dispositions
can
grow
are
then
like
ours
they
are
susceptible
of
every
generous
sentiment
of
every
useful
motive
of
action
they
are
capable
of
receiving
lights
of
imbibing
ideas
that
would
greatly
alleviate
the
weight
of
their
miseries
but
what
methods
have
in
general
been
made
use
of
to
obtain
so
desirable
an
end
none
the
day
in
which
they
arrive
and
are
sold
is
the
first
of
their
labours
labours
which
from
that
hour
admit
of
no
respite
for
though
indulged
by
law
with
relaxation
on
sundays
they
are
obliged
to
employ
that
time
which
is
intended
for
rest
to
till
their
little
plantations
what
can
be
expected
from
wretches
in
such
circumstances
forced
from
their
native
country
cruelly
treated
when
on
board
and
not
less
so
on
the
plantations
to
which
they
are
driven
is
there
anything
in
this
treatment
but
what
must
kindle
all
the
passions
sow
the
seeds
of
inveterate
resentment
and
nourish
a
wish
of
perpetual
revenge
they
are
left
to
the
irresistible
effects
of
those
strong
and
natural
propensities
the
blows
they
receive
are
they
conducive
to
extinguish
them
or
to
win
their
affections
they
are
neither
soothed
by
the
hopes
that
their
slavery
will
ever
terminate
but
with
their
lives
or
yet
encouraged
by
the
goodness
of
their
food
or
the
mildness
of
their
treatment
the
very
hopes
held
out
to
mankind
by
religion
that
consolatory
system
so
useful
to
the
miserable
are
never
presented
to
them
neither
moral
nor
physical
means
are
made
use
of
to
soften
their
chains
they
are
left
in
their
original
and
untutored
state
that
very
state
wherein
the
natural
propensities
of
revenge
and
warm
passions
are
so
soon
kindled
cheered
by
no
one
single
motive
that
can
impel
the
will
or
excite
their
efforts
nothing
but
terrors
and
punishments
are
presented
to
them
death
is
denounced
if
they
run
away
horrid
delaceration
if
they
speak
with
their
native
freedom
perpetually
awed
by
the
terrible
cracks
of
whips
or
by
the
fear
of
capital
punishments
while
even
those
punishments
often
fail
of
their
purpose
a
clergyman
settled
a
few
years
ago
at
and
feeling
as
i
do
now
warmly
recommended
to
the
planters
from
the
pulpit
a
relaxation
of
severity
he
introduced
the
benignity
of
christianity
and
pathetically
made
use
of
the
admirable
precepts
of
that
system
to
melt
the
hearts
of
his
congregation
into
a
greater
degree
of
compassion
toward
their
slaves
than
had
been
hitherto
customary
sir
said
one
of
his
hearers
we
pay
you
a
genteel
salary
to
read
to
us
the
prayers
of
the
liturgy
and
to
explain
to
us
such
parts
of
the
gospel
as
the
rule
of
the
church
directs
but
we
do
not
want
you
to
teach
us
what
we
are
to
do
with
our
blacks
the
clergyman
found
it
prudent
to
withhold
any
farther
admonition
whence
this
astonishing
right
or
rather
this
barbarous
custom
for
most
certainly
we
have
no
kind
of
right
beyond
that
of
force
we
are
told
it
is
true
that
slavery
can
not
be
so
repugnant
to
human
nature
as
we
at
first
imagine
because
it
has
been
practised
in
all
ages
and
in
all
nations
the
lacedemonians
themselves
those
great
assertors
of
liberty
conquered
the
helotes
with
the
design
of
making
them
their
slaves
the
romans
whom
we
consider
as
our
masters
in
civil
and
military
policy
lived
in
the
exercise
of
the
most
horrid
oppression
they
conquered
to
plunder
and
to
enslave
what
a
hideous
aspect
the
face
of
the
earth
must
then
have
exhibited
provinces
towns
districts
often
depopulated
their
inhabitants
driven
to
rome
the
greatest
market
in
the
world
and
there
sold
by
thousands
the
roman
dominions
were
tilled
by
the
hands
of
unfortunate
people
who
had
once
been
like
their
victors
free
rich
and
possessed
of
every
benefit
society
can
confer
until
they
became
subject
to
the
cruel
right
of
war
and
to
lawless
force
is
there
then
no
superintending
power
who
conducts
the
moral
operations
of
the
world
as
well
as
the
physical
the
same
sublime
hand
which
guides
the
planets
round
the
sun
with
so
much
exactness
which
preserves
the
arrangement
of
the
whole
with
such
exalted
wisdom
and
paternal
care
and
prevents
the
vast
system
from
falling
into
confusion
doth
it
abandon
mankind
to
all
the
errors
the
follies
and
the
miseries
which
their
most
frantic
rage
and
their
most
dangerous
vices
and
passions
can
produce
the
history
of
the
earth
doth
it
present
anything
but
crimes
of
the
most
heinous
nature
committed
from
one
end
of
the
world
to
the
other
we
observe
avarice
rapine
and
murder
equally
prevailing
in
all
parts
history
perpetually
tells
us
of
millions
of
people
abandoned
to
the
caprice
of
the
maddest
princes
and
of
whole
nations
devoted
to
the
blind
fury
of
tyrants
countries
destroyed
nations
alternately
buried
in
ruins
by
other
nations
some
parts
of
the
world
beautifully
cultivated
returned
again
to
the
pristine
state
the
fruits
of
ages
of
industry
the
toil
of
thousands
in
a
short
time
destroyed
by
a
few
if
one
corner
breathes
in
peace
for
a
few
years
it
is
in
turn
subjected
torn
and
levelled
one
would
almost
believe
the
principles
of
action
in
man
considered
as
the
first
agent
of
this
planet
to
be
poisoned
in
their
most
essential
parts
we
certainly
are
not
that
class
of
beings
which
we
vainly
think
ourselves
to
be
man
an
animal
of
prey
seems
to
have
rapine
and
the
love
of
bloodshed
implanted
in
his
heart
nay
to
hold
it
the
most
honourable
occupation
in
society
we
never
speak
of
a
hero
of
mathematics
a
hero
of
knowledge
of
humanity
no
this
illustrious
appellation
is
reserved
for
the
most
successful
butchers
of
the
world
if
nature
has
given
us
a
fruitful
soil
to
inhabit
she
has
refused
us
such
inclinations
and
propensities
as
would
afford
us
the
full
enjoyment
of
it
extensive
as
the
surface
of
this
planet
is
not
one
half
of
it
is
yet
cultivated
not
half
replenished
she
created
man
and
placed
him
either
in
the
woods
or
plains
and
provided
him
with
passions
which
must
for
ever
oppose
his
happiness
everything
is
submitted
to
the
power
of
the
strongest
men
like
the
elements
are
always
at
war
the
weakest
yield
to
the
most
potent
force
subtlety
and
malice
always
triumph
over
unguarded
honesty
and
simplicity
benignity
moderation
and
justice
are
virtues
adapted
only
to
the
humble
paths
of
life
we
love
to
talk
of
virtue
and
to
admire
its
beauty
while
in
the
shade
of
solitude
and
retirement
but
when
we
step
forth
into
active
life
if
it
happen
to
be
in
competition
with
any
passion
or
desire
do
we
observe
it
to
prevail
hence
so
many
religious
impostors
have
triumphed
over
the
credulity
of
mankind
and
have
rendered
their
frauds
the
creeds
of
succeeding
generations
during
the
course
of
many
ages
until
worn
away
by
time
they
have
been
replaced
by
new
ones
hence
the
most
unjust
war
if
supported
by
the
greatest
force
always
succeeds
hence
the
most
just
ones
when
supported
only
by
their
justice
as
often
fail
such
is
the
ascendancy
of
power
the
supreme
arbiter
of
all
the
revolutions
which
we
observe
in
this
planet
so
irresistible
is
power
that
it
often
thwarts
the
tendency
of
the
most
forcible
causes
and
prevents
their
subsequent
salutary
effects
though
ordained
for
the
good
of
man
by
the
governor
of
the
universe
such
is
the
perverseness
of
human
nature
who
can
describe
it
in
all
its
latitude
in
the
moments
of
our
philanthropy
we
often
talk
of
an
indulgent
nature
a
kind
parent
who
for
the
benefit
of
mankind
has
taken
singular
pains
to
vary
the
genera
of
plants
fruits
grain
and
the
different
productions
of
the
earth
and
has
spread
peculiar
blessings
in
each
climate
this
is
undoubtedly
an
object
of
contemplation
which
calls
forth
our
warmest
gratitude
for
so
singularly
benevolent
have
those
parental
intentions
been
that
where
barrenness
of
soil
or
severity
of
climate
prevail
there
she
has
implanted
in
the
heart
of
man
sentiments
which
overbalance
every
misery
and
supply
the
place
of
every
want
she
has
given
to
the
inhabitants
of
these
regions
an
attachment
to
their
savage
rocks
and
wild
shores
unknown
to
those
who
inhabit
the
fertile
fields
of
the
temperate
zone
yet
if
we
attentively
view
this
globe
will
it
not
appear
rather
a
place
of
punishment
than
of
delight
and
what
misfortune
that
those
punishments
should
fall
on
the
innocent
and
its
few
delights
be
enjoyed
by
the
most
unworthy
famine
diseases
elementary
convulsions
human
feuds
dissensions
are
the
produce
of
every
climate
each
climate
produces
besides
vices
and
miseries
peculiar
to
its
latitude
view
the
frigid
sterility
of
the
north
whose
famished
inhabitants
hardly
acquainted
with
the
sun
live
and
fare
worse
than
the
bears
they
hunt
and
to
which
they
are
superior
only
in
the
faculty
of
speaking
view
the
arctic
and
antarctic
regions
those
huge
voids
where
nothing
lives
regions
of
eternal
snow
where
winter
in
all
his
horrors
has
established
his
throne
and
arrested
every
creative
power
of
nature
will
you
call
the
miserable
stragglers
in
these
countries
by
the
name
of
men
now
contrast
this
frigid
power
of
the
north
and
south
with
that

torrid
zone

sulphureous
exhalations

countries

pestilential
infections

waste

this
globe
often
convulsed
both
from
within
and
without
pouring
forth
from
several
mouths
rivers
of
boiling

are
imperceptibly
leaving
immense
subterranean
graves

millions
will
one
day
perish

at

poisonous

those
putrid
slimy
tracks

with
horrid
monsters

enemies

human
race
look
next
at
the
sandy
continent
scorched
perhaps
by
the
fatal
approach
of
some
ancient
comet
now
the
abode
of
desolation

the
rains
the
convulsive
storms
of
those
climates
where
masses
of
sulphur
bitumen
and
electrical
fire
combining
their
dreadful
powers
are
incessantly
hovering
and
bursting
over
a
globe
threatened
with
dissolution
on
this
little
shell
how
very
few
are
the
spots
where
man
can
live
and
flourish
even
under
those
mild
climates
which
seem
to
breathe
peace
and
happiness
the
poison
of
slavery
the
fury
of
despotism
and
the
rage
of
superstition
are
all
combined
against
man
there
only
the
few
live
and
rule
whilst
the
many
starve
and
utter
ineffectual
complaints
there
human
nature
appears
more
debased
perhaps
than
in
the
less
favoured
climates
the
fertile
plains
of
asia
the
rich
low
lands
of
egypt
and
of
diarbeck
the
fruitful
fields
bordering
on
the
tigris
and
the
euphrates
the
extensive
country
of
the
east
indies
in
all
its
separate
districts
all
these
must
to
the
geographical
eye
seem
as
if
intended
for
terrestrial
paradises
but
though
surrounded
with
the
spontaneous
riches
of
nature
though
her
kindest
favours
seem
to
be
shed
on
those
beautiful
regions
with
the
most
profuse
hand
yet
there
in
general
we
find
the
most
wretched
people
in
the
world
almost
everywhere
liberty
so
natural
to
mankind
is
refused
or
rather
enjoyed
but
by
their
tyrants
the
word
slave
is
the
appellation
of
every
rank
who
adore
as
a
divinity
a
being
worse
than
themselves
subject
to
every
caprice
and
to
every
lawless
rage
which
unrestrained
power
can
give
tears
are
shed
perpetual
groans
are
heard
where
only
the
accents
of
peace
alacrity
and
gratitude
should
resound
there
the
very
delirium
of
tyranny
tramples
on
the
best
gifts
of
nature
and
sports
with
the
fate
the
happiness
the
lives
of
millions
there
the
extreme
fertility
of
the
ground
always
indicates
the
extreme
misery
of
the
inhabitants
everywhere
one
part
of
the
human
species
are
taught
the
art
of
shedding
the
blood
of
the
other
of
setting
fire
to
their
dwellings
of
levelling
the
works
of
their
industry
half
of
the
existence
of
nations
regularly
employed
in
destroying
other
what
little
political
felicity
is
to
be
met
with
here
and
there
has
cost
oceans
of
blood
to
purchase
as
if
good
was
never
to
be
the
portion
of
unhappy
man
republics
kingdoms
monarchies
founded
either
on
fraud
or
successful
violence
increase
by
pursuing
the
steps
of
the
same
policy
until
they
are
destroyed
in
their
turn
either
by
the
influence
of
their
own
crimes
or
by
more
successful
but
equally
criminal
enemies
if
from
this
general
review
of
human
nature
we
descend
to
the
examination
of
what
is
called
civilised
society
there
the
combination
of
every
natural
and
artificial
want
makes
us
pay
very
dear
for
what
little
share
of
political
felicity
we
enjoy
it
is
a
strange
heterogeneous
assemblage
of
vices
and
virtues
and
of
a
variety
of
other
principles
for
ever
at
war
for
ever
jarring
for
ever
producing
some
dangerous
some
distressing
extreme
where
do
you
conceive
then
that
nature
intended
we
should
be
happy
would
you
prefer
the
state
of
men
in
the
woods
to
that
of
men
in
a
more
improved
situation
evil
preponderates
in
both
in
the
first
they
often
eat
each
other
for
want
of
food
and
in
the
other
they
often
starve
each
other
for
want
of
room
for
my
part
i
think
the
vices
and
miseries
to
be
found
in
the
latter
exceed
those
of
the

they
must
grope
amidst
as
many
errors
commit
as
many
crimes
and
meet
with
as
many
diseases

and

the
following
scene
will
i
hope
account
for
these
melancholy
reflections
and
apologise
for
the
gloomy
thoughts
with
which
i
have
filled
this
letter
my
mind
is
and
always
has
been
oppressed
since
i
became
a
witness
to
it
i
was
not
long
since
invited
to
dine
with
a
planter
who
lived
three
miles
from
where
he
then
resided
in
order
to
avoid
the
heat
of
the
sun
i
resolved
to
go
on
foot
sheltered
in
a
small
path
leading
through
a
pleasant
wood
i
was
leisurely
travelling
along
attentively
examining
some
peculiar
plants
which
i
had
collected
when
all
at
once
i
felt
the
air
strongly
agitated
though
the
day
was
perfectly
calm
and
sultry
i
immediately
cast
my
eyes
toward
the
cleared
ground
from
which
i
was
but
at
a
small
distance
in
order
to
see
whether
it
was
not
occasioned
by
a
sudden
shower
when
at
that
instant
a
sound
resembling
a
deep
rough
voice
uttered
as
i
thought
a
few
inarticulate
monosyllables
alarmed
and
surprised
i
precipitately
looked
all
round
when
i
perceived
at
about
six
rods
distance
something
resembling
a
cage
suspended
to
the
limbs
of
a
tree
all
the
branches
of
which
appeared
covered
with
large
birds
of
prey
fluttering
about
and
anxiously
endeavouring
to
perch
on
the
cage
actuated
by
an
involuntary
motion
of
my
hands
more
than
by
any
design
of
my
mind
i
fired
at
them
they
all
flew
to
a
short
distance
with
a
most
hideous
noise
when
horrid
to
think
and
painful
to
repeat
i
perceived
a
negro
suspended
in
the
cage
and
left
there
to
expire
i
shudder
when
i
recollect
that
the
birds
had
already
picked
out
his
eyes
his
cheek
bones
were
bare
his
arms
had
been
attacked
in
several
places
and
his
body
seemed
covered
with
a
multitude
of
wounds
from
the
edges
of
the
hollow
sockets
and
from
the
lacerations
with
which
he
was
disfigured
the
blood
slowly
dropped
and
tinged
the
ground
beneath
no
sooner
were
the
birds
flown
than
swarms
of
insects
covered
the
whole
body
of
this
unfortunate
wretch
eager
to
feed
on
his
mangled
flesh
and
to
drink
his
blood
i
found
myself
suddenly
arrested
by
the
power
of
affright
and
terror
my
nerves
were
convoked
i
trembled
i
stood
motionless
involuntarily
contemplating
the
fate
of
this
negro
in
all
its
dismal
latitude
the
living
spectre
though
deprived
of
his
eyes
could
still
distinctly
hear
and
in
his
uncouth
dialect
begged
me
to
give
him
some
water
to
allay
his
thirst
humanity
herself
would
have
recoiled
back
with
horror
she
would
have
balanced
whether
to
lessen
such
reliefless
distress
or
mercifully
with
one
blow
to
end
this
dreadful
scene
of
agonising
torture
had
i
had
a
ball
in
my
gun
i
certainly
should
have
despatched
him
but
finding
myself
unable
to
perform
so
kind
an
office
i
sought
though
trembling
to
relieve
him
as
well
as
i
could
a
shell
ready
fixed
to
a
pole
which
had
been
used
by
some
negroes
presented
itself
to
me
filled
it
with
water
and
with
trembling
hands
i
guided
it
to
the
quivering
lips
of
the
wretched
sufferer
urged
by
the
irresistible
power
of
thirst
he
endeavoured
to
meet
it
as
he
instinctively
guessed
its
approach
by
the
noise
it
made
in
passing
through
the
bars
of
the
cage
tanke
you
white
man
tanke
you
pute
some
poison
and
give
me
how
long
have
you
been
hanging
there
i
asked
him
two
days
and
me
no
die
the
birds
the
birds
aaah
me
oppressed
with
the
reflections
which
this
shocking
spectacle
afforded
me
i
mustered
strength
enough
to
walk
away
and
soon
reached
the
house
at
which
i
intended
to
dine
there
i
heard
that
the
reason
for
this
slave
being
thus
punished
was
on
account
of
his
having
killed
the
overseer
of
the
plantation
they
told
me
that
the
laws
of
rendered
such
executions
necessary
and
supported
the
doctrine
of
slavery
with
the
arguments
generally
made
use
of
to
justify
the
practice
with
the
repetition
of
which
i
shall
not
trouble
you
at
adieu
letter
x
on
snakes
and
on
the
humming
bird
why
would
you
prescribe
this
task
you
know
that
what
we
take
up
ourselves
seems
always
lighter
than
what
is
imposed
on
us
by
others
you
insist
on
my
saying
something
about
our
snakes
and
in
relating
what
i
know
concerning
them
were
it
not
for
two
singularities
the
one
of
which
i
saw
and
the
other
i
received
from
an
i
should
have
but
very
little
to
observe
the
southern
provinces
are
the
countries
where
nature
has
formed
the
greatest
variety
of
alligators
snakes
serpents
and
scorpions
from
the
smallest
size
up
to
the
pine
barren
the
largest
species
known
here
we
have
but
two
whose
stings
are
mortal
which
deserve
to
be
mentioned
as
for
the
black
one
it
is
remarkable
for
nothing
but
its
industry
agility
beauty
and
the
art
of
enticing
birds
by
the
power
of
its
eyes
i
admire
it
much
and
never
kill
it
though
its
formidable
length
and
appearance
often
get
the
better
of
the
philosophy
of
some
people
particularly
of
europeans
the
most
dangerous
one
is
the
pilot
or
copperhead
for
the
poison
of
which
no
remedy
has
yet
been
discovered
it
bears
the
first
name
because
it
always
precedes
the
rattlesnake
that
is
quits
its
state
of
torpidity
in
the
spring
a
week
before
the
other
it
bears
the
second
name
on
account
of
its
head
being
adorned
with
many
spots
it
lurks
in
rocks
near
the
water
and
is
extremely
active
and
dangerous
let
man
beware
of
it
i
have
heard
only
of
one
person
who
was
stung
by
a
copperhead
in
this
country
the
poor
wretch
instantly
swelled
in
a
most
dreadful
manner
a
multitude
of
spots
of
different
hues
alternately
appeared
and
vanished
on
different
parts
of
his
body
his
eyes
were
filled
with
madness
and
rage
he
cast
them
on
all
present
with
the
most
vindictive
looks
he
thrust
out
his
tongue
as
the
snakes
do
he
hissed
through
his
teeth
with
inconceivable
strength
and
became
an
object
of
terror
to
all
to
the
lividness
of
a
corpse
he
united
the
desperate
force
of
a
maniac
they
hardly
were
able
to
fasten
him
so
as
to
guard
themselves
from
his
attacks
when
in
the
space
of
two
hours
death
relieved
the
poor
wretch
from
his
struggles
and
the
spectators
from
their
apprehensions
the
poison
of
the
rattlesnake
is
not
mortal
in
so
short
a
space
and
hence
there
is
more
time
to
procure
relief
we
are
acquainted
with
several
antidotes
with
which
almost
every
family
is
provided
they
are
extremely
inactive
and
if
not
touched
are
perfectly
inoffensive
i
once
saw
as
i
was
travelling
a
great
cliff
which
was
full
of
them
i
handled
several
and
they
appeared
to
be
dead
they
were
all
entwined
together
and
thus
they
remain
until
the
return
of
the
sun
i
found
them
out
by
following
the
track
of
some
wild
hogs
which
had
fed
on
them
and
even
the
indians
often
regale
on
them
when
they
find
them
asleep
they
put
a
small
forked
stick
over
their
necks
which
they
keep
immovably
fixed
on
the
ground
giving
the
snake
a
piece
of
leather
to
bite
and
this
they
pull
back
several
times
with
great
force
until
they
observe
their
two
poisonous
fangs
torn
out
then
they
cut
off
the
head
skin
the
body
and
cook
it
as
we
do
eels
and
their
flesh
is
extremely
sweet
and
white
i
once
saw
a
tamed
one
as
gentle
as
you
can
possibly
conceive
a
reptile
to
be
it
took
to
the
water
and
swam
whenever
it
pleased
and
when
the
boys
to
whom
it
belonged
called
it
back
their
summons
was
readily
obeyed
it
had
been
deprived
of
its
fangs
by
the
preceding
method
they
often
stroked
it
with
a
soft
brush
and
this
friction
seemed
to
cause
the
most
pleasing
sensations
for
it
would
turn
on
its
back
to
enjoy
it
as
a
cat
does
before
the
fire
one
of
this
species
was
the
cause
some
years
ago
of
a
most
deplorable
accident
which
i
shall
relate
to
you
as
i
had
it
from
the
widow
and
mother
of
the
victims
a
dutch
farmer
of
the
minisink
went
to
mowing
with
his
negroes
in
his
boots
a
precaution
used
to
prevent
being
stung
inadvertently
he
trod
on
a
snake
which
immediately
flew
at
his
legs
and
as
it
drew
back
in
order
to
renew
its
blow
one
of
his
negroes
cut
it
in
two
with
his
scythe
they
prosecuted
their
work
and
returned
home
at
night
the
farmer
pulled
off
his
boots
and
went
to
bed
and
was
soon
after
attacked
with
a
strange
sickness
at
his
stomach
he
swelled
and
before
a
physician
could
be
sent
for
died
the
sudden
death
of
this
man
did
not
cause
much
inquiry
the
neighbourhood
wondered
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
and
without
any
further
examination
the
corpse
was
buried
a
few
days
after
the
son
put
on
his
father
boots
and
went
to
the
meadow
at
night
he
pulled
them
off
went
to
bed
and
was
attacked
with
the
same
symptoms
about
the
same
time
and
died
in
the
morning
a
little
before
he
expired
the
doctor
came
but
was
not
able
to
assign
what
could
be
the
cause
of
so
singular
a
disorder
however
rather
than
appear
wholly
at
a
loss
before
the
country
people
he
pronounced
both
father
and
son
to
have
been
bewitched
some
weeks
after
the
widow
sold
all
the
movables
for
the
benefit
of
the
younger
children
and
the
farm
was
leased
one
of
the
neighbours
who
bought
the
boots
presently
put
them
on
and
was
attacked
in
the
same
manner
as
the
other
two
had
been
but
this
man
wife
being
alarmed
by
what
had
happened
in
the
former
family
despatched
one
of
her
negroes
for
an
eminent
physician
who
fortunately
having
heard
something
of
the
dreadful
affair
guessed
at
the
cause
applied
oil
etc
and
recovered
the
man
the
boots
which
had
been
so
fatal
were
then
carefully
examined
and
he
found
that
the
two
fangs
of
the
snake
had
been
left
in
the
leather
after
being
wrenched
out
of
their
sockets
by
the
strength
with
which
the
snake
had
drawn
back
its
head
the
bladders
which
contained
the
poison
and
several
of
the
small
nerves
were
still
fresh
and
adhered
to
the
boot
the
unfortunate
father
and
son
had
been
poisoned
by
pulling
off
these
boots
in
which
action
they
imperceptibly
scratched
their
legs
with
the
points
of
the
fangs
through
the
hollow
of
which
some
of
this
astonishing
poison
was
conveyed
you
have
no
doubt
heard
of
their
rattles
if
you
have
not
seen
them
the
only
observation
i
wish
to
make
is
that
the
rattling
is
loud
and
distinct
when
they
are
angry
and
on
the
contrary
when
pleased
it
sounds
like
a
distant
trepidation
in
which
nothing
distinct
is
heard
in
the
thick
settlements
they
are
now
become
very
scarce
for
wherever
they
are
met
with
open
war
is
declared
against
them
so
that
in
a
few
years
there
will
be
none
left
but
on
our
mountains
the
black
snake
on
the
contrary
always
diverts
me
because
it
excites
no
idea
of
danger
their
swiftness
is
astonishing
they
will
sometimes
equal
that
of
a
horse
at
other
times
they
will
climb
up
trees
in
quest
of
our
tree
toads
or
glide
on
the
ground
at
full
length
on
some
occasions
they
present
themselves
half
in
the
reptile
state
half
erect
their
eyes
and
their
heads
in
the
erect
posture
appear
to
great
advantage
the
former
display
a
fire
which
i
have
often
admired
and
it
is
by
these
they
are
enabled
to
fascinate
birds
and
squirrels
when
they
have
fixed
their
eyes
on
an
animal
they
become
immovable
only
turning
their
head
sometimes
to
the
right
and
sometimes
to
the
left
but
still
with
their
sight
invariably
directed
to
the
object
the
distracted
victim
instead
of
flying
its
enemy
seems
to
be
arrested
by
some
invincible
power
it
screams
now
approaches
and
then
recedes
and
after
skipping
about
with
unaccountable
agitation
finally
rushes
into
the
jaws
of
the
snake
and
is
swallowed
as
soon
as
it
is
covered
with
a
slime
or
glue
to
make
it
slide
easily
down
the
throat
of
the
devourer
one
anecdote
i
must
relate
the
circumstances
of
which
are
as
true
as
they
are
singular
one
of
my
constant
walks
when
i
am
at
leisure
is
in
my
lowlands
where
i
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
my
cattle
horses
and
colts
exuberant
grass
replenishes
all
my
fields
the
best
representative
of
our
wealth
in
the
middle
of
that
tract
i
have
cut
a
ditch
eight
feet
wide
the
banks
of
which
nature
adorns
every
spring
with
the
wild
salendine
and
other
flowering
weeds
which
on
these
luxuriant
grounds
shoot
up
to
a
great
height
over
this
ditch
i
have
erected
a
bridge
capable
of
bearing
a
loaded
waggon
on
each
side
i
carefully
sow
every
year
some
grains
of
hemp
which
rise
to
the
height
of
fifteen
feet
so
strong
and
so
full
of
limbs
as
to
resemble
young
trees
i
once
ascended
one
of
them
four
feet
above
the
ground
these
produce
natural
arbours
rendered
often
still
more
compact
by
the
assistance
of
an
annual
creeping
plant
which
we
call
a
vine
that
never
fails
to
entwine
itself
among
their
branches
and
always
produces
a
very
desirable
shade
from
this
simple
grove
i
have
amused
myself
an
hundred
times
in
observing
the
great
number
of
humming
birds
with
which
our
country
abounds
the
wild
blossoms
everywhere
attract
the
attention
of
these
birds
which
like
bees
subsist
by
suction
from
this
retreat
i
distinctly
watch
them
in
all
their
various
attitudes
but
their
flight
is
so
rapid
that
you
can
not
distinguish
the
motion
of
their
wings
on
this
little
bird
nature
has
profusely
lavished
her
most
splendid
colours
the
most
perfect
azure
the
most
beautiful
gold
the
most
dazzling
red
are
for
ever
in
contrast
and
help
to
embellish
the
plumes
of
his
majestic
head
the
richest
palette
of
the
most
luxuriant
painter
could
never
invent
anything
to
be
compared
to
the
variegated
tints
with
which
this
insect
bird
is
arrayed
its
bill
is
as
long
and
as
sharp
as
a
coarse
sewing
needle
like
the
bee
nature
has
taught
it
to
find
out
in
the
calix
of
flowers
and
blossoms
those
mellifluous
particles
that
serve
it
for
sufficient
food
and
yet
it
seems
to
leave
them
untouched
undeprived
of
anything
that
our
eyes
can
possibly
distinguish
when
it
feeds
it
appears
as
if
immovable
though
continually
on
the
wing
and
sometimes
from
what
motives
i
know
not
it
will
tear
and
lacerate
flowers
into
a
hundred
pieces
for
strange
to
tell
they
are
the
most
irascible
of
the
feathered
tribe
where
do
passions
find
room
in
so
diminutive
a
body
they
often
fight
with
the
fury
of
lions
until
one
of
the
combatants
falls
a
sacrifice
and
dies
when
fatigued
it
has
often
perched
within
a
few
feet
of
me
and
on
such
favourable
opportunities
i
have
surveyed
it
with
the
most
minute
attention
its
little
eyes
appear
like
diamonds
reflecting
light
on
every
side
most
elegantly
finished
in
all
parts
it
is
a
miniature
work
of
our
great
parent
who
seems
to
have
formed
it
the
smallest
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
beautiful
of
the
winged
species
as
i
was
one
day
sitting
solitary
and
pensive
in
my
primitive
arbour
my
attention
was
engaged
by
a
strange
sort
of
rustling
noise
at
some
paces
distant
i
looked
all
around
without
distinguishing
anything
until
i
climbed
one
of
my
great
hemp
stalks
when
to
my
astonishment
i
beheld
two
snakes
of
considerable
length
the
one
pursuing
the
other
with
great
celerity
through
a
hemp
stubble
field
the
aggressor
was
of
the
black
kind
six
feet
long
the
fugitive
was
a
water
snake
nearly
of
equal
dimensions
they
soon
met
and
in
the
fury
of
their
first
encounter
they
appeared
in
an
instant
firmly
twisted
together
and
whilst
their
united
tails
beat
the
ground
they
mutually
tried
with
open
jaws
to
lacerate
each
other
what
a
fell
aspect
did
they
present
their
heads
were
compressed
to
a
very
small
size
their
eyes
flashed
fire
and
after
this
conflict
had
lasted
about
five
minutes
the
second
found
means
to
disengage
itself
from
the
first
and
hurried
toward
the
ditch
its
antagonist
instantly
assumed
a
new
posture
and
half
creeping
and
half
erect
with
a
majestic
mien
overtook
and
attacked
the
other
again
which
placed
itself
in
the
same
attitude
and
prepared
to
resist
the
scene
was
uncommon
and
beautiful
for
thus
opposed
they
fought
with
their
jaws
biting
each
other
with
the
utmost
rage
but
notwithstanding
this
appearance
of
mutual
courage
and
fury
the
water
snake
still
seemed
desirous
of
retreating
toward
the
ditch
its
natural
element
this
was
no
sooner
perceived
by
the
black
one
than
twisting
its
tail
twice
round
a
stalk
of
hemp
and
seizing
its
adversary
by
the
throat
not
by
means
of
its
jaws
but
by
twisting
its
own
neck
twice
round
that
of
the
water
snake
pulled
it
back
from
the
ditch
to
prevent
a
defeat
the
latter
took
hold
likewise
of
a
stalk
on
the
bank
and
by
the
acquisition
of
that
point
of
resistance
became
a
match
for
its
fierce
antagonist
strange
was
this
to
behold
two
great
snakes
strongly
adhering
to
the
ground
mutually
fastened
together
by
means
of
the
writhings
which
lashed
them
to
each
other
and
stretched
at
their
full
length
they
pulled
but
pulled
in
vain
and
in
the
moments
of
greatest
exertions
that
part
of
their
bodies
which
was
entwined
seemed
extremely
small
while
the
rest
appeared
inflated
and
now
and
then
convulsed
with
strong
undulations
rapidly
following
each
other
their
eyes
seemed
on
fire
and
ready
to
start
out
of
their
heads
at
one
time
the
conflict
seemed
decided
the
water
snake
bent
itself
into
two
great
folds
and
by
that
operation
rendered
the
other
more
than
commonly
outstretched
the
next
minute
the
new
struggles
of
the
black
one
gained
an
unexpected
superiority
it
acquired
two
great
folds
likewise
which
necessarily
extended
the
body
of
its
adversary
in
proportion
as
it
had
contracted
its
own
these
efforts
were
alternate
victory
seemed
doubtful
inclining
sometimes
to
the
one
side
and
sometimes
to
the
other
until
at
last
the
stalk
to
which
the
black
snake
fastened
suddenly
gave
way
and
in
consequence
of
this
accident
they
both
plunged
into
the
ditch
the
water
did
not
extinguish
their
vindictive
rage
for
by
their
agitations
i
could
trace
though
not
distinguish
their
mutual
attacks
they
soon
appeared
on
the
surface
twisted
together
as
in
their
first
onset
but
the
black
snake
seemed
to
retain
its
wonted
superiority
for
its
head
was
exactly
fixed
above
that
of
the
other
which
it
incessantly
pressed
down
under
the
water
until
it
was
stifled
and
sunk
the
victor
no
sooner
perceived
its
enemy
incapable
of
farther
resistance
than
abandoning
it
to
the
current
it
returned
on
shore
and
disappeared

a
russian
gentleman
describing
the
visit
he
paid
at
my
request
to
john
bertram
the
celebrated
pennsylvanian
botanist
examine
this
flourishing
province
in
whatever
light
you
will
the
eyes
as
well
as
the
mind
of
an
european
traveller
are
equally
delighted
because
a
diffusive
happiness
appears
in
every
part
happiness
which
is
established
on
the
broadest
basis
the
wisdom
of
lycurgus
and
solon
never
conferred
on
man
one
half
of
the
blessings
and
uninterrupted
prosperity
which
the
pennsylvanians
now
possess
the
name
of
penn
that
simple
but
illustrious
citizen
does
more
honour
to
the
english
nation
than
those
of
many
of
their
kings
in
order
to
convince
you
that
i
have
not
bestowed
undeserved
praises
in
my
former
letters
on
this
celebrated
government
and
that
either
nature
or
the
climate
seems
to
be
more
favourable
here
to
the
arts
and
sciences
than
to
any
other
american
province
let
us
together
agreeable
to
your
desire
pay
a
visit
to
john
bertram
the
first
botanist
in
this
new
hemisphere
become
such
by
a
native
impulse
of
disposition
it
is
to
this
simple
man
that
america
is
indebted
for
several
useful
discoveries
and
the
knowledge
of
many
new
plants
i
had
been
greatly
prepossessed
in
his
favour
by
the
extensive
correspondence
which
i
knew
he
held
with
the
most
eminent
scotch
and
french
botanists
i
knew
also
that
he
had
been
honoured
with
that
of
queen
ulrica
of
sweden
his
house
is
small
but
decent
there
was
something
peculiar
in
its
first
appearance
which
seemed
to
distinguish
it
from
those
of
his
neighbours
a
small
tower
in
the
middle
of
it
not
only
helped
to
strengthen
it
but
afforded
convenient
room
for
a
staircase
every
disposition
of
the
fields
fences
and
trees
seemed
to
bear
the
marks
of
perfect
order
and
regularity
which
in
rural
affairs
always
indicate
a
prosperous
industry
i
was
received
at
the
door
by
a
woman
dressed
extremely
neat
and
simple
who
without
courtesying
or
any
other
ceremonial
asked
me
with
an
air
of
benignity
who
i
wanted
i
answered
i
should
be
glad
to
see
bertram
if
thee
wilt
step
in
and
take
a
chair
i
will
send
for
him
no
i
said
i
had
rather
have
the
pleasure
of
walking
through
his
farm
i
shall
easily
find
him
out
with
your
directions
after
a
little
time
i
perceived
the
schuylkill
winding
through
delightful
meadows
and
soon
cast
my
eyes
on
a
bank
which
seemed
greatly
to
confine
its
stream
after
having
walked
on
its
top
a
considerable
way
i
at
last
reached
the
place
where
ten
men
were
at
work
i
asked
if
any
of
them
could
tell
me
where
bertram
was
an
elderly
looking
man
with
wide
trousers
and
a
large
leather
apron
on
looking
at
me
said
my
name
is
bertram
dost
thee
want
me
sir
i
am
come
on
purpose
to
converse
with
you
if
you
can
be
spared
from
your
labour
very
easily
he
answered
i
direct
and
advise
more
than
i
work
we
walked
toward
the
house
where
he
made
me
take
a
chair
while
he
went
to
put
on
clean
clothes
after
which
he
returned
and
sat
down
by
me
the
fame
of
your
knowledge
said
i
in
american
botany
and
your
hospitality
have
induced
me
to
pay
you
a
visit
which
i
hope
you
will
not
think
troublesome
i
should
be
glad
to
spend
a
few
hours
in
your
garden
the
greatest
advantage
replied
he
which
i
receive
from
what
thee
callest
my
botanical
fame
is
the
pleasure
which
it
often
procureth
me
in
receiving
the
visits
of
friends
and
foreigners
but
our
jaunt
into
the
garden
must
be
postponed
for
the
present
as
the
bell
is
ringing
for
dinner
we
entered
into
a
large
hall
where
there
was
a
long
table
full
of
victuals
at
the
lowest
part
sat
his
negroes
his
hired
men
were
next
then
the
family
and
myself
and
at
the
head
the
venerable
father
and
his
wife
presided
each
reclined
his
head
and
said
his
prayers
divested
of
the
tedious
cant
of
some
and
of
the
ostentatious
style
of
others
after
the
luxuries
of
our
cities
observed
he
this
plain
fare
must
appear
to
thee
a
severe
fast
by
no
means
bertram
this
honest
country
dinner
convinces
me
that
you
receive
me
as
a
friend
and
an
old
acquaintance
i
am
glad
of
it
for
thee
art
heartily
welcome
i
never
knew
how
to
use
ceremonies
they
are
insufficient
proofs
of
sincerity
our
society
besides
are
utterly
strangers
to
what
the
world
calleth
polite
expressions
we
treat
others
as
we
treat
ourselves
i
received
yesterday
a
letter
from
philadelphia
by
which
i
understand
thee
art
a
russian
what
motives
can
possibly
have
induced
thee
to
quit
thy
native
country
and
to
come
so
far
in
quest
of
knowledge
or
pleasure
verily
it
is
a
great
compliment
thee
payest
to
this
our
young
province
to
think
that
anything
it
exhibiteth
may
be
worthy
thy
attention
i
have
been
most
amply
repaid
for
the
trouble
of
the
passage
i
view
the
present
americans
as
the
seed
of
future
nations
which
will
replenish
this
boundless
continent
the
russians
may
be
in
some
respects
compared
to
you
we
likewise
are
a
new
people
new
i
mean
in
knowledge
arts
and
improvements
who
knows
what
revolutions
russia
and
america
may
one
day
bring
about
we
are
perhaps
nearer
neighbours
than
we
imagine
i
view
with
peculiar
attention
all
your
towns
i
examine
their
situation
and
the
police
for
which
many
are
already
famous
though
their
foundations
are
now
so
recent
and
so
well
remembered
yet
their
origin
will
puzzle
posterity
as
much
as
we
are
now
puzzled
to
ascertain
the
beginning
of
those
which
time
has
in
some
measure
destroyed
your
new
buildings
your
streets
put
me
in
mind
of
those
of
the
city
of
pompeia
where
i
was
a
few
years
ago
i
attentively
examined
everything
there
particularly
the
which
runs
along
the
houses
they
appeared
to
have
been
considerably
worn
by
the
great
number
of
people
which
had
once
travelled
over
them
but
now
how
distant
neither
builders
nor
proprietors
remain
nothing
is
known
why
thee
hast
been
a
great
traveller
for
a
man
of
thy
years
few
years
sir
will
enable
anybody
to
journey
over
a
great
tract
of
country
but
it
requires
a
superior
degree
of
knowledge
to
gather
harvests
as
we
go
pray
bertram
what
banks
are
those
which
you
are
making
to
what
purpose
is
so
much
expense
and
so
much
labour
bestowed
friend
iwan
no
branch
of
industry
was
ever
more
profitable
to
any
country
as
well
as
to
the
proprietors
the
schuylkill
in
its
many
windings
once
covered
a
great
extent
of
ground
though
its
waters
were
but
shallow
even
in
our
highest
tides
and
though
some
parts
were
always
dry
yet
the
whole
of
this
great
tract
presented
to
the
eye
nothing
but
a
putrid
swampy
soil
useless
either
for
the
plough
or
for
the
scythe
the
proprietors
of
these
grounds
are
now
incorporated
we
yearly
pay
to
the
treasurer
of
the
company
a
certain
sum
which
makes
an
aggregate
superior
to
the
casualties
that
generally
happen
either
by
inundations
or
the
musk
squash
it
is
owing
to
this
happy
contrivance
that
so
many
thousand
acres
of
meadows
have
been
rescued
from
the
schuylkill
which
now
both
enricheth
and
embellisheth
so
much
of
the
neighbourhood
of
our
city
our
brethren
of
salem
in
new
jersey
have
carried
the
art
of
banking
to
a
still
higher
degree
of
perfection
it
is
really
an
admirable
contrivance
which
greatly
redounds
to
the
honour
of
the
parties
concerned
and
shows
a
spirit
of
discernment
and
perseverance
which
is
highly
praiseworthy
if
the
virginians
would
imitate
your
example
the
state
of
their
husbandry
would
greatly
improve
i
have
not
heard
of
any
such
association
in
any
other
parts
of
the
continent
pennsylvania
hitherto
seems
to
reign
the
unrivalled
queen
of
these
fair
provinces
pray
sir
what
expense
are
you
at
these
grounds
be
fit
for
the
scythe
the
expenses
are
very
considerable
particularly
when
we
have
land
brooks
trees
and
brush
to
clear
away
but
such
is
the
excellence
of
these
bottoms
and
the
goodness
of
the
grass
for
fattening
of
cattle
that
the
produce
of
three
years
pays
all
advances
happy
the
country
where
nature
has
bestowed
such
rich
treasures
treasures
superior
to
mines
said
i
if
all
this
fair
province
is
thus
cultivated
no
wonder
it
has
acquired
such
reputation
for
the
prosperity
and
the
industry
of
its
inhabitants
by
this
time
the
working
part
of
the
family
had
finished
their
dinner
and
had
retired
with
a
decency
and
silence
which
pleased
me
much
soon
after
i
heard
as
i
thought
a
distant
concert
of
however
simple
and
pastoral
your
fare
was
bertram
this
is
the
dessert
of
a
prince
pray
what
is
this
i
hear
thee
must
not
be
alarmed
it
is
of
a
piece
with
the
rest
of
thy
treatment
friend
iwan
anxious
i
followed
the
sound
and
by
ascending
the
staircase
found
that
it
was
the
effect
of
the
wind
through
the
strings
of
an
eolian
harp
an
instrument
which
i
had
never
before
seen
after
dinner
we
quaffed
an
honest
bottle
of
madeira
wine
without
the
irksome
labour
of
toasts
healths
or
sentiments
and
then
retired
into
his
study
i
was
no
sooner
entered
than
i
observed
a
coat
of
arms
in
a
gilt
frame
with
the
name
of
john
bertram
the
novelty
of
such
a
decoration
in
such
a
place
struck
me
i
could
not
avoid
asking
does
the
society
of
friends
take
any
pride
in
those
armorial
bearings
which
sometimes
serve
as
marks
of
distinction
between
families
and
much
oftener
as
food
for
pride
and
ostentation
thee
must
know
said
he
that
my
father
was
a
frenchman
he
brought
this
piece
of
painting
over
with
him
i
keep
it
as
a
piece
of
family
furniture
and
as
a
memorial
of
his
removal
hither
from
his
study
we
went
into
the
garden
which
contained
a
great
variety
of
curious
plants
and
shrubs
some
grew
in
a
greenhouse
over
the
door
of
which
were
written
these
lines
slave
to
no
sect
who
takes
no
private
road
but
looks
through
nature
up
to
nature
god
he
informed
me
that
he
had
often
followed
general
bouquet
to
pittsburgh
with
the
view
of
herbalising
that
he
had
made
useful
collections
in
virginia
and
that
he
had
been
employed
by
the
king
of
england
to
visit
the
two
floridas
our
walks
and
botanical
observations
engrossed
so
much
of
our
time
that
the
sun
was
almost
down
ere
i
thought
of
returning
to
philadelphia
i
regretted
that
the
day
had
been
so
short
as
i
had
not
spent
so
rational
a
one
for
a
long
time
before
i
wanted
to
stay
yet
was
doubtful
whether
it
would
not
appear
improper
being
an
utter
stranger
knowing
however
that
i
was
visiting
the
least
ceremonious
people
in
the
world
i
bluntly
informed
him
of
the
pleasure
i
had
enjoyed
and
with
the
desire
i
had
of
staying
a
few
days
with
him
thee
art
as
welcome
as
if
i
was
thy
father
thee
art
no
stranger
thy
desire
of
knowledge
thy
being
a
foreigner
besides
entitleth
thee
to
consider
my
house
as
thine
own
as
long
as
thee
pleaseth
use
thy
time
with
the
most
perfect
freedom
i
too
shall
do
so
myself
i
thankfully
accepted
the
kind
invitation
we
went
to
view
his
favourite
bank
he
showed
me
the
principles
and
method
on
which
it
was
erected
and
we
walked
over
the
grounds
which
had
been
already
drained
the
whole
store
of
nature
kind
luxuriance
seemed
to
have
been
exhausted
on
these
beautiful
meadows
he
made
me
count
the
amazing
number
of
cattle
and
horses
now
feeding
on
solid
bottoms
which
but
a
few
years
before
had
been
covered
with
water
thence
we
rambled
through
his
fields
where
the
fences
the
heaps
of
pitched
stones
the
flourishing
clover
announced
the
best
husbandry
as
well
as
the
most
assiduous
attention
his
cows
were
then
returning
home
deep
bellied
short
legged
having
udders
ready
to
burst
seeking
with
seeming
toil
to
be
delivered
from
the
great
exuberance
they
contained
he
next
showed
me
his
orchard
formerly
planted
on
a
barren
sandy
soil
but
long
since
converted
into
one
of
the
richest
spots
in
that
vicinage
this
said
he
is
altogether
the
fruit
of
my
own
contrivance
i
purchased
some
years
ago
the
privilege
of
a
small
spring
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
hence
which
at
a
considerable
expense
i
have
brought
to
this
reservoir
therein
i
throw
old
lime
ashes
dung
and
twice
a
week
i
let
it
run
thus
impregnated
i
regularly
spread
on
this
ground
in
the
fall
old
hay
straw
and
whatever
damaged
fodder
i
have
about
my
barn
by
these
simple
means
i
mow
one
year
with
another
hundreds
of
excellent
hay
per
acre
from
a
soil
which
scarcely
produced
a
small
plant
resembling
strawberries
some
years
before
this
is
sir
a
miracle
in
husbandry
happy
the
country
which
is
cultivated
by
a
society
of
men
whose
application
and
taste
lead
them
to
prosecute
and
accomplish
useful
works
i
am
not
the
only
person
who
do
these
things
he
said
wherever
water
can
be
had
it
is
always
turned
to
that
important
use
wherever
a
farmer
can
water
his
meadows
the
greatest
crops
of
the
best
hay
and
excellent
are
the
sure
rewards
of
his
labours
with
the
banks
of
my
meadow
ditches
i
have
greatly
enriched
my
upland
fields
those
which
i
intend
to
rest
for
a
few
years
i
constantly
sow
with
red
clover
which
is
the
greatest
meliorator
of
our
lands
for
three
years
after
they
yield
abundant
pasture
when
i
want
to
break
up
my
clover
fields
i
give
them
a
good
coat
of
mud
which
hath
been
exposed
to
the
severities
of
three
or
four
of
our
winters
this
is
the
reason
that
i
commonly
reap
from
to
bushels
of
wheat
an
acre
my
flax
oats
and
indian
corn
i
raise
in
the
same
proportion
wouldst
thee
inform
me
whether
the
inhabitants
of
thy
country
follow
the
same
methods
of
husbandry
no
sir
in
the
neighbourhood
of
our
towns
there
are
indeed
some
intelligent
farmers
who
prosecute
their
rural
schemes
with
attention
but
we
should
be
too
numerous
too
happy
too
powerful
a
people
if
it
were
possible
for
the
whole
russian
empire
to
be
cultivated
like
the
province
of
pennsylvania
our
lands
are
so
unequally
divided
and
so
few
of
our
farmers
are
possessors
of
the
soil
they
till
that
they
can
not
execute
plans
of
husbandry
with
the
same
vigour
as
you
do
who
hold
yours
as
it
were
from
the
master
of
nature
unencumbered
and
free
oh
america
exclaimed
i
thou
knowest
not
as
yet
the
whole
extent
of
thy
happiness
the
foundation
of
thy
civil
polity
must
lead
thee
in
a
few
years
to
a
degree
of
population
and
power
which
europe
little
thinks
of
long
before
this
happen
answered
the
good
man
we
shall
rest
beneath
the
turf
it
is
vain
for
mortals
to
be
presumptuous
in
their
conjectures
our
country
is
no
doubt
the
cradle
of
an
extensive
future
population
the
old
world
is
growing
weary
of
its
inhabitants
they
must
come
here
to
flee
from
the
tyranny
of
the
great
but
doth
not
thee
imagine
that
the
great
will
in
the
course
of
years
come
over
here
also
for
it
is
the
misfortune
of
all
societies
everywhere
to
hear
of
great
men
great
rulers
and
of
great
tyrants
my
dear
sir
i
replied
tyranny
never
can
take
a
strong
hold
in
this
country
the
land
is
too
widely
distributed
it
is
poverty
in
europe
that
makes
slaves
friend
iwan
as
i
make
no
doubt
that
thee
understandest
the
latin
tongue
read
this
kind
epistle
which
the
good
queen
of
sweden
ulrica
sent
me
a
few
years
ago
good
woman
that
she
should
think
in
her
palace
at
stockholm
of
poor
john
bertram
on
the
banks
of
the
schuylkill
appeareth
to
me
very
strange
not
in
the
least
dear
sir
you
are
the
first
man
whose
name
as
a
botanist
hath
done
honour
to
america
it
is
very
natural
at
the
same
time
to
imagine
that
so
extensive
a
continent
must
contain
many
curious
plants
and
trees
is
it
then
surprising
to
see
a
princess
fond
of
useful
knowledge
descend
sometimes
from
the
throne
to
walk
in
the
gardens
of
linnaeus
is
to
the
directions
of
that
learned
man
said
bertram
that
i
am
indebted
for
the
method
which
has
led
me
to
the
knowledge
i
now
possess
the
science
of
botany
is
so
diffusive
that
a
proper
thread
is
absolutely
wanted
to
conduct
the
beginner
pray
bertram
when
did
you
imbibe
the
first
wish
to
cultivate
the
science
of
botany
was
you
regularly
bred
to
it
in
philadelphia
i
have
never
received
any
other
education
than
barely
reading
and
writing
this
small
farm
was
all
the
patrimony
my
father
left
me
certain
debts
and
the
want
of
meadows
kept
me
rather
low
in
the
beginning
of
my
life
my
wife
brought
me
nothing
in
money
all
her
riches
consisted
in
her
good
temper
and
great
knowledge
of
housewifery
i
scarcely
know
how
to
trace
my
steps
in
the
botanical
career
they
appear
to
me
now
like
unto
a
dream
but
thee
mayest
rely
on
what
i
shall
relate
though
i
know
that
some
of
our
friends
have
laughed
at
it
i
am
not
one
of
those
people
bertram
who
aim
at
finding
out
the
ridiculous
in
what
is
sincerely
and
honestly
averred
well
then
i
tell
thee
one
day
i
was
very
busy
in
holding
my
plough
for
thee
seest
that
i
am
but
a
ploughman
and
being
weary
i
ran
under
the
shade
of
a
tree
to
repose
myself
i
cast
my
eyes
on
a
daisy
i
plucked
it
mechanically
and
viewed
it
with
more
curiosity
than
common
country
farmers
are
wont
to
do
and
observed
therein
very
many
distinct
parts
some
perpendicular
some
horizontal
what
a
shame
said
my
mind
or
something
that
inspired
my
mind
that
thee
shouldest
have
employed
so
many
years
in
tilling
the
earth
and
destroying
so
many
flowers
and
plants
without
being
acquainted
with
their
structures
and
their
uses
this
seeming
inspiration
suddenly
awakened
my
curiosity
for
these
were
not
thoughts
to
which
i
had
been
accustomed
i
returned
to
my
team
but
this
new
desire
did
not
quit
my
mind
i
mentioned
it
to
my
wife
who
greatly
discouraged
me
from
prosecuting
my
new
scheme
as
she
called
it
i
was
not
opulent
enough
she
said
to
dedicate
much
of
my
time
to
studies
and
labours
which
might
rob
me
of
that
portion
of
it
which
is
the
only
wealth
of
the
american
farmer
however
her
prudent
caution
did
not
discourage
me
i
thought
about
it
continually
at
supper
in
bed
and
wherever
i
went
at
last
i
could
not
resist
the
impulse
for
on
the
fourth
day
of
the
following
week
i
hired
a
man
to
plough
for
me
and
went
to
philadelphia
though
i
knew
not
what
book
to
call
for
i
ingeniously
told
the
bookseller
my
errand
who
provided
me
with
such
as
he
thought
best
and
a
latin
grammar
beside
next
i
applied
to
a
neighbouring
schoolmaster
who
in
three
months
taught
me
latin
enough
to
understand
linnaeus
which
i
purchased
afterward
then
i
began
to
botanise
all
over
my
farm
in
a
little
time
i
became
acquainted
with
every
vegetable
that
grew
in
my
neighbourhood
and
next
ventured
into
maryland
living
among
the
friends
in
proportion
as
i
thought
myself
more
learned
i
proceeded
farther
and
by
a
steady
application
of
several
years
i
have
acquired
a
pretty
general
knowledge
of
every
plant
and
tree
to
be
found
in
our
continent
in
process
of
time
i
was
applied
to
from
the
old
countries
whither
i
every
year
send
many
collections
being
now
made
easy
in
my
circumstances
i
have
ceased
to
labour
and
am
never
so
happy
as
when
i
see
and
converse
with
my
friends
if
among
the
many
plants
or
shrubs
i
am
acquainted
with
there
are
any
thee
wantest
to
send
to
thy
native
country
i
will
cheerfully
procure
them
and
give
thee
moreover
whatever
directions
thee
mayest
want
thus
i
passed
several
days
in
ease
improvement
and
pleasure
i
observed
in
all
the
operations
of
his
farm
as
well
as
in
the
mutual
correspondence
between
the
master
and
the
inferior
members
of
his
family
the
greatest
ease
and
decorum
not
a
word
like
command
seemed
to
exceed
the
tone
of
a
simple
wish
the
very
negroes
themselves
appeared
to
partake
of
such
a
decency
of
behaviour
and
modesty
of
countenance
as
i
had
never
before
observed
by
what
means
said
i
bertram
do
you
rule
your
slaves
so
well
that
they
seem
to
do
their
work
with
all
the
cheerfulness
of
white
men
though
our
erroneous
prejudices
and
opinions
once
induced
us
to
look
upon
them
as
fit
only
for
slavery
though
ancient
custom
had
very
unfortunately
taught
us
to
keep
them
in
bondage
yet
of
late
in
consequence
of
the
remonstrances
of
several
friends
and
of
the
good
books
they
have
published
on
that
subject
our
society
treats
them
very
differently
with
us
they
are
now
free
i
give
those
whom
thee
didst
see
at
my
table
eighteen
pounds
a
year
with
victuals
and
clothes
and
all
other
privileges
which
white
men
enjoy
our
society
treats
them
now
as
the
companions
of
our
labours
and
by
this
management
as
well
as
by
means
of
the
education
we
have
given
them
they
are
in
general
become
a
new
set
of
beings
those
whom
i
admit
to
my
table
i
have
found
to
be
good
trusty
moral
men
when
they
do
not
what
we
think
they
should
do
we
dismiss
them
which
is
all
the
punishment
we
inflict
other
societies
of
christians
keep
them
still
as
slaves
without
teaching
them
any
kind
of
religious
principles
what
motive
beside
fear
can
they
have
to
behave
well
in
the
first
settlement
of
this
province
we
employed
them
as
slaves
i
acknowledge
but
when
we
found
that
good
example
gentle
admonition
and
religious
principles
could
lead
them
to
subordination
and
sobriety
we
relinquished
a
method
so
contrary
to
the
profession
of
christianity
we
gave
them
freedom
and
yet
few
have
quitted
their
ancient
masters
the
women
breed
in
our
families
and
we
become
attached
to
one
another
i
taught
mine
to
read
and
write
they
love
god
and
fear
his
judgments
the
oldest
person
among
them
transacts
my
business
in
philadelphia
with
a
punctuality
from
which
he
has
never
deviated
they
constantly
attend
our
meetings
they
participate
in
health
and
sickness
infancy
and
old
age
in
the
advantages
our
society
affords
such
are
the
means
we
have
made
use
of
to
relieve
them
from
that
bondage
and
ignorance
in
which
they
were
kept
before
thee
perhaps
hast
been
surprised
to
see
them
at
my
table
but
by
elevating
them
to
the
rank
of
freemen
they
necessarily
acquire
that
emulation
without
which
we
ourselves
should
fall
into
debasement
and
profligate
ways
bertram
this
is
the
most
philosophical
treatment
of
negroes
that
i
have
heard
of
happy
would
it
be
for
america
would
other
denominations
of
christians
imbibe
the
same
principles
and
follow
the
same
admirable
rules
a
great
number
of
men
would
be
relieved
from
those
cruel
shackles
under
which
they
now
groan
and
under
this
impression
i
can
not
endure
to
spend
more
time
in
the
southern
provinces
the
method
with
which
they
are
treated
there
the
meanness
of
their
food
the
severity
of
their
tasks
are
spectacles
i
have
not
patience
to
behold
i
am
glad
to
see
that
thee
hast
so
much
compassion
are
there
any
slaves
in
thy
country
yes
unfortunately
but
they
are
more
properly
civil
than
domestic
slaves
they
are
attached
to
the
soil
on
which
they
live
it
is
the
remains
of
ancient
barbarous
customs
established
in
the
days
of
the
greatest
ignorance
and
savageness
of
manners
and
preserved
notwithstanding
the
repeated
tears
of
humanity
the
loud
calls
of
policy
and
the
commands
of
religion
the
pride
of
great
men
with
the
avarice
of
landholders
make
them
look
on
this
class
as
necessary
tools
of
husbandry
as
if
freemen
could
not
cultivate
the
ground
and
is
it
really
so
friend
iwan
to
be
poor
to
be
wretched
to
be
a
slave
are
hard
indeed
existence
is
not
worth
enjoying
on
those
terms
i
am
afraid
thy
country
can
never
flourish
under
such
impolitic
government
i
am
very
much
of
your
opinion
bertram
though
i
am
in
hopes
that
the
present
reign
illustrious
by
so
many
acts
of
the
soundest
policy
will
not
expire
without
this
salutary
this
necessary
emancipation
which
would
fill
the
russian
empire
with
tears
of
gratitude
how
long
hast
thee
been
in
this
country
four
years
sir
why
thee
speakest
english
almost
like
a
native
what
a
toil
a
traveller
must
undergo
to
learn
various
languages
to
divest
himself
of
his
native
prejudices
and
to
accommodate
himself
to
the
customs
of
all
those
among
whom
he
chooseth
to
reside
thus
i
spent
my
time
with
this
enlightened
botanist
this
worthy
citizen
who
united
all
the
simplicity
of
rustic
manners
to
the
most
useful
learning
various
and
extensive
were
the
conversations
that
filled
the
measure
of
my
visit
i
accompanied
him
to
his
fields
to
his
barn
to
his
bank
to
his
garden
to
his
study
and
at
last
to
the
meeting
of
the
society
on
the
sunday
following
it
was
at
the
town
of
chester
whither
the
whole
family
went
in
two
waggons
bertram
and
i
on
horseback
when
i
entered
the
house
where
the
friends
were
assembled
who
might
be
about
two
hundred
men
and
women
the
involuntary
impulse
of
ancient
custom
made
me
pull
off
my
hat
but
soon
recovering
myself
i
sat
with
it
on
at
the
end
of
a
bench
the
was
a
square
building
devoid
of
any
ornament
whatever
the
whiteness
of
the
walls
the
conveniency
of
seats
that
of
a
large
stove
which
in
cold
weather
keeps
the
whole
house
warm
were
the
only
essential
things
which
i
observed
neither
pulpit
nor
desk
fount
nor
altar
tabernacle
nor
organ
were
there
to
be
seen
it
is
merely
a
spacious
room
in
which
these
good
people
meet
every
sunday
a
profound
silence
ensued
which
lasted
about
half
an
hour
every
one
had
his
head
reclined
and
seemed
absorbed
in
profound
meditation
when
a
female
friend
arose
and
declared
with
a
most
engaging
modesty
that
the
spirit
moved
her
to
entertain
them
on
the
subject
she
had
chosen
she
treated
it
with
great
propriety
as
a
moral
useful
discourse
and
delivered
it
without
theological
parade
or
the
ostentation
of
learning
either
she
must
have
been
a
great
adept
in
public
speaking
or
had
studiously
prepared
herself
a
circumstance
that
can
not
well
be
supposed
as
it
is
a
point
in
their
profession
to
utter
nothing
but
what
arises
from
spontaneous
impulse
or
else
the
great
spirit
of
the
world
the
patronage
and
influence
of
which
they
all
came
to
invoke
must
have
inspired
her
with
the
soundest
morality
her
discourse
lasted
three
quarters
of
an
hour
i
did
not
observe
one
single
face
turned
toward
her
never
before
had
i
seen
a
congregation
listening
with
so
much
attention
to
a
public
oration
i
observed
neither
contortions
of
body
nor
any
kind
of
affectation
in
her
face
style
or
manner
of
utterance
everything
was
natural
and
therefore
pleasing
and
shall
i
tell
you
more
she
was
very
handsome
although
upward
of
forty
as
soon
as
she
had
finished
every
one
seemed
to
return
to
their
former
meditation
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
they
rose
up
by
common
consent
and
after
some
general
conversation
departed
how
simple
their
precepts
how
unadorned
their
religious
system
how
few
the
ceremonies
through
which
they
pass
during
the
course
of
their
lives
at
their
deaths
they
are
interred
by
the
fraternity
without
pomp
without
prayers
thinking
it
then
too
late
to
alter
the
course
of
god
eternal
decrees
and
as
you
well
know
without
either
monument
or
tombstone
thus
after
having
lived
under
the
mildest
government
after
having
been
guided
by
the
mildest
doctrine
they
die
just
as
peaceably
as
those
who
being
educated
in
more
pompous
religions
pass
through
a
variety
of
sacraments
subscribe
to
complicated
creeds
and
enjoy
the
benefits
of
a
church
establishment
these
good
people
flatter
themselves
with
following
the
doctrines
of
jesus
christ
in
that
simplicity
with
which
they
were
delivered
an
happier
system
could
not
have
been
devised
for
the
use
of
mankind
it
appears
to
be
entirely
free
from
those
ornaments
and
political
additions
which
each
country
and
each
government
hath
fashioned
after
its
own
manners
at
the
door
of
this
meeting
house
i
had
been
invited
to
spend
some
days
at
the
houses
of
some
respectable
farmers
in
the
neighbourhood
the
reception
i
met
with
everywhere
insensibly
led
me
to
spend
two
months
among
these
good
people
and
i
must
say
they
were
the
golden
days
of
my
riper
years
i
never
shall
forget
the
gratitude
i
owe
them
for
the
innumerable
kindnesses
they
heaped
on
me
it
was
to
the
letter
you
gave
me
that
i
am
indebted
for
the
extensive
acquaintance
i
now
have
throughout
pennsylvania
i
must
defer
thanking
you
as
i
ought
until
i
see
you
again
before
that
time
comes
i
may
perhaps
entertain
you
with
more
curious
anecdotes
than
this
letter
i
n
al
z
letter
xii
distresses
of
a
frontier
man
i
wish
for
a
change
of
place
the
hour
is
come
at
last
that
i
must
fly
from
my
house
and
abandon
my
farm
but
what
course
shall
i
steer
inclosed
as
i
am
the
climate
best
adapted
to
my
present
situation
and
humour
would
be
the
polar
regions
where
six
months
day
and
six
months
night
divide
the
dull
year
nay
a
simple
aurora
borealis
would
suffice
me
and
greatly
refresh
my
eyes
fatigued
now
by
so
many
disagreeable
objects
the
severity
of
those
climates
that
great
gloom
where
melancholy
dwells
would
be
perfectly
analogous
to
the
turn
of
my
mind
oh
could
i
remove
my
plantation
to
the
shores
of
the
oby
willingly
would
i
dwell
in
the
hut
of
a
samoyede
with
cheerfulness
would
i
go
and
bury
myself
in
the
cavern
of
a
laplander
could
i
but
carry
my
family
along
with
me
i
would
winter
at
pello
or
tobolsky
in
order
to
enjoy
the
peace
and
innocence
of
that
country
but
let
me
arrive
under
the
pole
or
reach
the
antipodes
i
never
can
leave
behind
me
the
remembrance
of
the
dreadful
scenes
to
which
i
have
been
a
witness
therefore
never
can
i
be
happy
happy
why
would
i
mention
that
sweet
that
enchanting
word
once
happiness
was
our
portion
now
it
is
gone
from
us
and
i
am
afraid
not
to
be
enjoyed
again
by
the
present
generation
whichever
way
i
look
nothing
but
the
most
frightful
precipices
present
themselves
to
my
view
in
which
hundreds
of
my
friends
and
acquaintances
have
already
perished
of
all
animals
that
live
on
the
surface
of
this
planet
what
is
man
when
no
longer
connected
with
society
or
when
he
finds
himself
surrounded
by
a
convulsed
and
a
half
dissolved
one
he
can
not
live
in
solitude
he
must
belong
to
some
community
bound
by
some
ties
however
imperfect
men
mutually
support
and
add
to
the
boldness
and
confidence
of
each
other
the
weakness
of
each
is
strengthened
by
the
force
of
the
whole
i
had
never
before
these
calamitous
times
formed
any
such
ideas
i
lived
on
laboured
and
prospered
without
having
ever
studied
on
what
the
security
of
my
life
and
the
foundation
of
my
prosperity
were
established
i
perceived
them
just
as
they
left
me
never
was
a
situation
so
singularly
terrible
as
mine
in
every
possible
respect
as
a
member
of
an
extensive
society
as
a
citizen
of
an
inferior
division
of
the
same
society
as
a
husband
as
a
father
as
a
man
who
exquisitely
feels
for
the
miseries
of
others
as
well
as
for
his
own
but
alas
so
much
is
everything
now
subverted
among
us
that
the
very
word
misery
with
which
we
were
hardly
acquainted
before
no
longer
conveys
the
same
ideas
or
rather
tired
with
feeling
for
the
miseries
of
others
every
one
feels
now
for
himself
alone
when
i
consider
myself
as
connected
in
all
these
characters
as
bound
by
so
many
cords
all
uniting
in
my
heart
i
am
seized
with
a
fever
of
the
mind
i
am
transported
beyond
that
degree
of
calmness
which
is
necessary
to
delineate
our
thoughts
i
feel
as
if
my
reason
wanted
to
leave
me
as
if
it
would
burst
its
poor
weak
tenement
again
i
try
to
compose
myself
i
grow
cool
and
preconceiving
the
dreadful
loss
i
endeavour
to
retain
the
useful
guest
you
know
the
position
of
our
settlement
i
need
not
therefore
describe
it
to
the
west
it
is
inclosed
by
a
chain
of
mountains
reaching
to
to
the
east
the
country
is
as
yet
but
thinly
inhabited
we
are
almost
insulated
and
the
houses
are
at
a
considerable
distance
from
each
other
from
the
mountains
we
have
but
too
much
reason
to
expect
our
dreadful
enemy
the
wilderness
is
a
harbour
where
it
is
impossible
to
find
them
it
is
a
door
through
which
they
can
enter
our
country
whenever
they
please
and
as
they
seem
determined
to
destroy
the
whole
chain
of
frontiers
our
fate
can
not
be
far
distant
from
lake
champlain
almost
all
has
been
conflagrated
one
after
another
what
renders
these
incursions
still
more
terrible
is
that
they
most
commonly
take
place
in
the
dead
of
the
night
we
never
go
to
our
fields
but
we
are
seized
with
an
involuntary
fear
which
lessens
our
strength
and
weakens
our
labour
no
other
subject
of
conversation
intervenes
between
the
different
accounts
which
spread
through
the
country
of
successive
acts
of
devastation
and
these
told
in
swell
themselves
in
our
affrighted
imaginations
into
the
most
terrific
ideas
we
never
sit
down
either
to
dinner
or
supper
but
the
least
noise
immediately
spreads
a
general
alarm
and
prevents
us
from
enjoying
the
comfort
of
our
meals
the
very
appetite
proceeding
from
labour
and
peace
of
mind
is
gone
we
eat
just
enough
to
keep
us
alive
our
sleep
is
disturbed
by
the
most
frightful
dreams
sometimes
i
start
awake
as
if
the
great
hour
of
danger
was
come
at
other
times
the
howling
of
our
dogs
seems
to
announce
the
arrival
of
the
enemy
we
leap
out
of
bed
and
run
to
arms
my
poor
wife
with
panting
bosom
and
silent
tears
takes
leave
of
me
as
if
we
were
to
see
each
other
no
more
she
snatches
the
youngest
children
from
their
beds
who
suddenly
awakened
increase
by
their
innocent
questions
the
horror
of
the
dreadful
moment
she
tries
to
hide
them
in
the
cellar
as
if
our
cellar
was
inaccessible
to
the
fire
i
place
all
my
servants
at
the
windows
and
myself
at
the
door
where
i
am
determined
to
perish
fear
industriously
increases
every
sound
we
all
listen
each
communicates
to
the
other
his
ideas
and
conjectures
we
remain
thus
sometimes
for
whole
hours
our
hearts
and
our
minds
racked
by
the
most
anxious
suspense
what
a
dreadful
situation
a
thousand
times
worse
than
that
of
a
soldier
engaged
in
the
midst
of
the
most
severe
conflict
sometimes
feeling
the
spontaneous
courage
of
a
man
i
seem
to
wish
for
the
decisive
minute
the
next
instant
a
message
from
my
wife
sent
by
one
of
the
children
puzzling
me
beside
with
their
little
questions
unmans
me
away
goes
my
courage
and
i
descend
again
into
the
deepest
despondency
at
last
finding
that
it
was
a
false
alarm
we
return
once
more
to
our
beds
but
what
good
can
the
kind
sleep
of
nature
do
to
us
when
interrupted
by
such
scenes
securely
placed
as
you
are
you
can
have
no
idea
of
our
agitations
but
by
no
relation
can
be
equal
to
what
we
suffer
and
to
what
we
feel
every
morning
my
youngest
children
are
sure
to
have
frightful
dreams
to
relate
in
vain
i
exert
my
authority
to
keep
them
silent
it
is
not
in
my
power
and
these
images
of
their
disturbed
imagination
instead
of
being
frivolously
looked
upon
as
in
the
days
of
our
happiness
are
on
the
contrary
considered
as
warnings
and
sure
prognostics
of
our
future
fate
i
am
not
a
superstitious
man
but
since
our
misfortunes
i
am
grown
more
timid
and
less
disposed
to
treat
the
doctrine
of
omens
with
contempt
though
these
evils
have
been
gradual
yet
they
do
not
become
habitual
like
other
incidental
evils
the
nearer
i
view
the
end
of
this
catastrophe
the
more
i
shudder
but
why
should
i
trouble
you
with
such
unconnected
accounts
men
secure
and
out
of
danger
are
soon
fatigued
with
mournful
details
can
you
enter
with
me
into
fellowship
with
all
these
afflictive
sensations
have
you
a
tear
ready
to
shed
over
the
approaching
ruin
of
a
once
opulent
and
substantial
family
read
this
i
pray
with
the
eyes
of
sympathy
with
a
tender
sorrow
pity
the
lot
of
those
whom
you
once
called
your
friends
who
were
once
surrounded
with
plenty
ease
and
perfect
security
but
who
now
expect
every
night
to
be
their
last
and
who
are
as
wretched
as
criminals
under
an
impending
sentence
of
the
law
as
a
member
of
a
large
society
which
extends
to
many
parts
of
the
world
my
connection
with
it
is
too
distant
to
be
as
strong
as
that
which
binds
me
to
the
inferior
division
in
the
midst
of
which
i
live
i
am
told
that
the
great
nation
of
which
we
are
a
part
is
just
wise
and
free
beyond
any
other
on
earth
within
its
own
insular
boundaries
but
not
always
so
to
its
distant
conquests
i
shall
not
repeat
all
i
have
heard
because
i
can
not
believe
half
of
it
as
a
citizen
of
a
smaller
society
i
find
that
any
kind
of
opposition
to
its
now
prevailing
sentiments
immediately
begets
hatred
how
easily
do
men
pass
from
loving
to
hating
and
cursing
one
another
i
am
a
lover
of
peace
what
must
i
do
i
am
divided
between
the
respect
i
feel
for
the
ancient
connection
and
the
fear
of
innovations
with
the
consequence
of
which
i
am
not
well
acquainted
as
they
are
embraced
by
my
own
countrymen
i
am
conscious
that
i
was
happy
before
this
unfortunate
revolution
i
feel
that
i
am
no
longer
so
therefore
i
regret
the
change
this
is
the
only
mode
of
reasoning
adapted
to
persons
in
my
situation
if
i
attach
myself
to
the
mother
country
which
is
miles
from
me
i
become
what
is
called
an
enemy
to
my
own
region
if
i
follow
the
rest
of
my
countrymen
i
become
opposed
to
our
ancient
masters
both
extremes
appear
equally
dangerous
to
a
person
of
so
little
weight
and
consequence
as
i
am
whose
energy
and
example
are
of
no
avail
as
to
the
argument
on
which
the
dispute
is
founded
i
know
little
about
it
much
has
been
said
and
written
on
both
sides
but
who
has
a
judgment
capacious
and
clear
enough
to
decide
the
great
moving
principles
which
actuate
both
parties
are
much
hid
from
vulgar
eyes
like
mine
nothing
but
the
plausible
and
the
probable
are
offered
to
our
contemplation
the
innocent
class
are
always
the
victim
of
the
few
they
are
in
all
countries
and
at
all
times
the
inferior
agents
on
which
the
popular
phantom
is
erected
they
clamour
and
must
toil
and
bleed
and
are
always
sure
of
meeting
with
oppression
and
rebuke
it
is
for
the
sake
of
the
great
leaders
on
both
sides
that
so
much
blood
must
be
spilt
that
of
the
people
is
counted
as
nothing
great
events
are
not
achieved
for
us
though
it
is
by
us
that
they
are
principally
accomplished
by
the
arms
the
sweat
the
lives
of
the
people
books
tell
me
so
much
that
they
inform
me
of
nothing
sophistry
the
bane
of
freemen
launches
forth
in
all
her
deceiving
attire
after
all
most
men
reason
from
passions
and
shall
such
an
ignorant
individual
as
i
am
decide
and
say
this
side
is
right
that
side
is
wrong
sentiment
and
feeling
are
the
only
guides
i
know
alas
how
should
i
unravel
an
argument
in
which
reason
herself
hath
given
way
to
brutality
and
bloodshed
what
then
must
i
do
i
ask
the
wisest
lawyers
the
ablest
casuists
the
warmest
patriots
for
i
mean
honestly
great
source
of
wisdom
inspire
me
with
light
sufficient
to
guide
my
benighted
steps
out
of
this
intricate
maze
shall
i
discard
all
my
ancient
principles
shall
i
renounce
that
name
that
nation
which
i
held
once
so
respectable
i
feel
the
powerful
attraction
the
sentiments
they
inspired
grew
with
my
earliest
knowledge
and
were
grafted
upon
the
first
rudiments
of
my
education
on
the
other
hand
shall
i
arm
myself
against
that
country
where
i
first
drew
breath
against
the
of
my
youth
my
bosom
friends
my
acquaintance
the
idea
makes
me
shudder
must
i
be
called
a
parricide
a
traitor
a
villain
lose
the
esteem
of
all
those
whom
i
love
to
preserve
my
own
be
shunned
like
a
rattlesnake
or
be
pointed
at
like
a
bear
i
have
neither
heroism
not
magnanimity
enough
to
make
so
great
a
sacrifice
here
i
am
tied
i
am
fastened
by
numerous
strings
nor
do
i
repine
at
the
pressure
they
cause
ignorant
as
i
am
i
can
pervade
the
utmost
extent
of
the
calamities
which
have
already
overtaken
our
poor
afflicted
country
i
can
see
the
great
and
accumulated
ruin
yet
extending
itself
as
far
as
the
theatre
of
war
has
reached
i
hear
the
groans
of
thousands
of
families
now
ruined
and
desolated
by
our
aggressors
i
can
not
count
the
multitude
of
orphans
this
war
has
made
nor
ascertain
the
immensity
of
blood
we
have
lost
some
have
asked
whether
it
was
a
crime
to
resist
to
repel
some
parts
of
this
evil
others
have
asserted
that
a
resistance
so
general
makes
pardon
unattainable
and
repentance
useless
and
dividing
the
crime
among
so
many
renders
it
imperceptible
what
one
party
calls
meritorious
the
other
denominates
flagitious
these
opinions
vary
contract
or
expand
like
the
events
of
the
war
on
which
they
are
founded
what
can
an
insignificant
man
do
in
the
midst
of
these
jarring
contradictory
parties
equally
hostile
to
persons
situated
as
i
am
and
after
all
who
will
be
the
really
guilty
those
most
certainly
who
fail
of
success
our
fate
the
fate
of
thousands
is
then
necessarily
involved
in
the
dark
wheel
of
fortune
why
then
so
many
useless
reasonings
we
are
the
sport
of
fate
farewell
education
principles
love
of
our
country
farewell
all
are
become
useless
to
the
generality
of
us
he
who
governs
himself
according
to
what
he
calls
his
principles
may
be
punished
either
by
one
party
or
the
other
for
those
very
principles
he
who
proceeds
without
principle
as
chance
timidity
or
directs
will
not
perhaps
fare
better
but
he
will
be
less
blamed
what
are
we
in
the
great
scale
of
events
we
poor
defenceless
frontier
inhabitants
what
is
it
to
the
gazing
world
whether
we
breathe
or
whether
we
die
whatever
virtue
whatever
merit
and
disinterestedness
we
may
exhibit
in
our
secluded
retreats
of
what
avail
we
are
like
the
pismires
destroyed
by
the
plough
whose
destruction
prevents
not
the
future
crop
therefore
the
rule
of
nature
seems
to
be
the
best
rule
of
conduct
what
good
can
we
do
by
vain
resistance
by
useless
efforts
the
cool
the
distant
spectator
placed
in
safety
may
arraign
me
for
ingratitude
may
bring
forth
the
principles
of
solon
or
montesquieu
he
may
look
on
me
as
wilfully
guilty
he
may
call
me
by
the
most
opprobrious
names
secure
from
personal
danger
his
warm
imagination
undisturbed
by
the
least
agitation
of
the
heart
will
expatiate
freely
on
this
grand
question
and
will
consider
this
extended
field
but
as
exhibiting
the
double
scene
of
attack
and
defence
to
him
the
object
becomes
abstracted
the
intermediate
glares
the
perspective
distance
and
a
variety
of
opinions
unimpaired
by
affections
presents
to
his
mind
but
one
set
of
ideas
here
he
proclaims
the
high
guilt
of
the
one
and
there
the
right
of
the
other
but
let
him
come
and
reside
with
us
one
single
month
let
him
pass
with
us
through
all
the
successive
hours
of
necessary
toil
terror
and
affright
let
him
watch
with
us
his
musket
in
his
hand
through
tedious
sleepless
nights
his
imagination
furrowed
by
the
keen
chisel
of
every
passion
let
his
wife
and
his
children
become
exposed
to
the
most
dreadful
hazards
of
death
let
the
existence
of
his
property
depend
on
a
single
spark
blown
by
the
breath
of
an
enemy
let
him
tremble
with
us
in
our
fields
shudder
at
the
rustling
of
every
leaf
let
his
heart
the
seat
of
the
most
affecting
passions
be
powerfully
wrung
by
hearing
the
melancholy
end
of
his
relations
and
friends
let
him
trace
on
the
map
the
progress
of
these
desolations
let
his
alarmed
imagination
predict
to
him
the
night
the
dreadful
night
when
it
may
be
his
turn
to
perish
as
so
many
have
perished
before
observe
then
whether
the
man
will
not
get
the
better
of
the
citizen
whether
his
political
maxims
will
not
vanish
yes
he
will
cease
to
glow
so
warmly
with
the
glory
of
the
metropolis
all
his
wishes
will
be
turned
toward
the
preservation
of
his
family
oh
were
he
situated
where
i
am
were
his
house
perpetually
filled
as
mine
is
with
miserable
victims
just
escaped
from
the
flames
and
the
scalping
knife
telling
of
barbarities
and
murders
that
make
human
nature
tremble
his
situation
would
suspend
every
political
reflection
and
expel
every
abstract
idea
my
heart
is
full
and
involuntarily
takes
hold
of
any
notion
from
whence
it
can
receive
ideal
ease
or
relief
i
am
informed
that
the
king
has
the
most
numerous
as
well
as
the
fairest
progeny
of
children
of
any
potentate
now
in
the
world
he
may
be
a
great
king
but
he
must
feel
as
we
common
mortals
do
in
the
good
wishes
he
forms
for
their
lives
and
prosperity
his
mind
no
doubt
often
springs
forward
on
the
wings
of
anticipation
and
contemplates
us
as
happily
settled
in
the
world
if
a
poor
frontier
inhabitant
may
be
allowed
to
suppose
this
great
personage
the
first
in
our
system
to
be
exposed
but
for
one
hour
to
the
exquisite
pangs
we
so
often
feel
would
not
the
preservation
of
so
numerous
a
family
engross
all
his
thoughts
would
not
the
ideas
of
dominion
and
other
felicities
attendant
on
royalty
all
vanish
in
the
hour
of
danger
the
regal
character
however
sacred
would
be
superseded
by
the
stronger
because
more
natural
one
of
man
and
father
oh
did
he
but
know
the
circumstances
of
this
horrid
war
i
am
sure
he
would
put
a
stop
to
that
long
destruction
of
parents
and
children
i
am
sure
that
while
he
turned
his
ears
to
state
policy
he
would
attentively
listen
also
to
the
dictates
of
nature
that
great
parent
for
as
a
good
king
he
no
doubt
wishes
to
create
to
spare
and
to
protect
as
she
does
must
i
then
in
order
to
be
called
a
faithful
subject
coolly
and
philosophically
say
it
is
necessary
for
the
good
of
britain
that
my
children
brains
should
be
dashed
against
the
walls
of
the
house
in
which
they
were
reared
that
my
wife
should
be
stabbed
and
scalped
before
my
face
that
i
should
be
either
murdered
or
captivated
or
that
for
greater
expedition
we
should
all
be
locked
up
and
burnt
to
ashes
as
the
family
of
the
b
was
must
i
with
meekness
wait
for
that
last
pitch
of
desolation
and
receive
with
perfect
resignation
so
hard
a
fate
from
ruffians
acting
at
such
a
distance
from
the
eyes
of
any
superior
monsters
left
to
the
wild
impulses
of
the
wildest
nature
could
the
lions
of
africa
be
transported
here
and
let
loose
they
would
no
doubt
kill
us
in
order
to
prey
upon
our
carcasses
but
their
appetites
would
not
require
so
many
victims
shall
i
wait
to
be
punished
with
death
or
else
to
be
stripped
of
all
food
and
raiment
reduced
to
despair
without
redress
and
without
hope
shall
those
who
may
escape
see
everything
they
hold
dear
destroyed
and
gone
shall
those
few
survivors
lurking
in
some
obscure
corner
deplore
in
vain
the
fate
of
their
families
mourn
over
parents
either
captivated
butchered
or
burnt
roam
among
our
wilds
and
wait
for
death
at
the
foot
of
some
tree
without
a
murmur
or
without
a
sigh
for
the
good
of
the
cause
no
it
is
impossible
so
astonishing
a
sacrifice
is
not
to
be
expected
from
human
nature
it
must
belong
to
beings
of
an
inferior
or
superior
order
actuated
by
less
or
by
more
refined
principles
even
those
great
personages
who
are
so
far
elevated
above
the
common
ranks
of
men
those
i
mean
who
wield
and
direct
so
many
thunders
those
who
have
let
loose
against
us
these
demons
of
war
could
they
be
transported
here
and
metamorphosed
into
simple
planters
as
we
are
they
would
from
being
the
arbiters
of
human
destiny
sink
into
miserable
victims
they
would
feel
and
exclaim
as
we
do
and
be
as
much
at
a
loss
what
line
of
conduct
to
prosecute
do
you
well
comprehend
the
difficulties
of
our
situation
if
we
stay
we
are
sure
to
perish
at
one
time
or
another
no
vigilance
on
our
part
can
save
us
if
we
retire
we
know
not
where
to
go
every
house
is
filled
with
refugees
as
wretched
as
ourselves
and
if
we
remove
we
become
beggars
the
property
of
farmers
is
not
like
that
of
merchants
and
absolute
poverty
is
worse
than
death
if
we
take
up
arms
to
defend
ourselves
we
are
denominated
rebels
should
we
not
be
rebels
against
nature
could
we
be
shamefully
passive
shall
we
then
like
martyrs
glory
in
an
allegiance
now
become
useless
and
voluntarily
expose
ourselves
to
a
species
of
desolation
which
though
it
ruin
us
entirely
yet
enriches
not
our
ancient
masters
by
this
inflexible
and
sullen
attachment
we
shall
be
despised
by
our
countrymen
and
destroyed
by
our
ancient
friends
whatever
we
may
say
whatever
merit
we
may
claim
will
not
shelter
us
from
those
indiscriminate
blows
given
by
hired
banditti
animated
by
all
those
passions
which
urge
men
to
shed
the
blood
of
others
how
bitter
the
thought
on
the
contrary
blows
received
by
the
hands
of
those
from
whom
we
expected
protection
extinguish
ancient
respect
and
urge
us
to
to
revenge
this
is
the
path
which
nature
herself
points
out
as
well
to
the
civilised
as
to
the
uncivilised
the
creator
of
hearts
has
himself
stamped
on
them
those
propensities
at
their
first
formation
and
must
we
then
daily
receive
this
treatment
from
a
power
once
so
loved
the
fox
flies
or
deceives
the
hounds
that
pursue
him
the
bear
when
overtaken
boldly
resists
and
attacks
them
the
hen
the
very
timid
hen
fights
for
the
preservation
of
her
chickens
nor
does
she
decline
to
attack
and
to
meet
on
the
wing
even
the
swift
kite
shall
man
then
provided
both
with
instinct
and
reason
unmoved
unconcerned
and
passive
see
his
subsistence
consumed
and
his
progeny
either
ravished
from
him
or
murdered
shall
fictitious
reason
extinguish
the
unerring
impulse
of
instinct
no
my
former
respect
my
former
attachment
vanishes
with
my
safety
that
respect
and
attachment
was
purchased
by
protection
and
it
has
ceased
could
not
the
great
nation
we
belong
to
have
accomplished
her
designs
by
means
of
her
numerous
armies
by
means
of
those
fleets
which
cover
the
ocean
must
those
who
are
masters
of
two
thirds
of
the
trade
of
the
world
who
have
in
their
hands
the
power
which
almighty
gold
can
give
who
possess
a
species
of
wealth
that
increases
with
their
desires
must
they
establish
their
conquest
with
our
insignificant
innocent
blood
must
i
then
bid
farewell
to
britain
to
that
renowned
country
must
i
renounce
a
name
so
ancient
and
so
venerable
alas
she
herself
that
once
indulgent
parent
forces
me
to
take
up
arms
against
her
she
herself
first
inspired
the
most
unhappy
citizens
of
our
remote
districts
with
the
thoughts
of
shedding
the
blood
of
those
whom
they
used
to
call
by
the
name
of
friends
and
brethren
that
great
nation
which
now
convulses
the
world
which
hardly
knows
the
extent
of
her
indian
kingdoms
which
looks
toward
the
universal
monarchy
of
trade
of
industry
of
riches
of
power
why
must
she
strew
our
poor
frontiers
with
the
carcasses
of
her
friends
with
the
wrecks
of
our
insignificant
villages
in
which
there
is
no
gold
when
oppressed
by
painful
recollection
i
revolve
all
these
scattered
ideas
in
my
mind
when
i
contemplate
my
situation
and
the
thousand
streams
of
evil
with
which
i
am
surrounded
when
i
descend
into
the
particular
tendency
even
of
the
remedy
i
have
proposed
i
am
convulsed
convulsed
sometimes
to
that
degree
as
to
be
tempted
to
exclaim
why
has
the
master
of
the
world
permitted
so
much
indiscriminate
evil
throughout
every
part
of
this
poor
planet
at
all
times
and
among
all
kinds
of
people
it
ought
surely
to
be
the
punishment
of
the
wicked
only
i
bring
that
cup
to
my
lips
of
which
i
must
soon
taste
and
shudder
at
its
bitterness
what
then
is
life
i
ask
myself
is
it
a
gracious
gift
no
it
is
too
bitter
a
gift
means
something
valuable
conferred
but
life
appears
to
be
a
mere
accident
and
of
the
worst
kind
we
are
born
to
be
victims
of
diseases
and
passions
of
mischances
and
death
better
not
to
be
than
to
be
thus
impiously
i
roam
i
fly
from
one
erratic
thought
to
another
and
my
mind
irritated
by
these
acrimonious
reflections
is
ready
sometimes
to
lead
me
to
dangerous
extremes
of
violence
when
i
recollect
that
i
am
a
father
and
a
husband
the
return
of
these
endearing
ideas
strikes
deep
into
my
heart
alas
they
once
made
it
to
glow
with
pleasure
and
with
every
ravishing
exultation
but
now
they
fill
it
with
sorrow
at
other
times
my
wife
industriously
rouses
me
out
of
these
dreadful
meditations
and
soothes
me
by
all
the
reasoning
she
is
mistress
of
but
her
endeavours
only
serve
to
make
me
more
miserable
by
reflecting
that
she
must
share
with
all
these
calamities
the
bare
apprehensions
of
which
i
am
afraid
will
subvert
her
reason
nor
can
i
with
patience
think
that
a
beloved
wife
my
faithful
throughout
all
my
rural
schemes
the
principal
hand
which
has
assisted
me
in
rearing
the
prosperous
fabric
of
ease
and
independence
i
lately
possessed
as
well
as
my
children
those
tenants
of
my
heart
should
daily
and
nightly
be
exposed
to
such
a
cruel
fate
selfpreservation
is
above
all
political
precepts
and
rules
and
even
superior
to
the
dearest
opinions
of
our
minds
a
reasonable
accommodation
of
ourselves
to
the
various
exigencies
of
the
time
in
which
we
live
is
the
most
irresistible
precept
to
this
great
evil
i
must
seek
some
sort
of
remedy
adapted
to
remove
or
to
palliate
it
situated
as
i
am
what
steps
should
i
take
that
will
neither
injure
nor
insult
any
of
the
parties
and
at
the
same
time
save
my
family
from
that
certain
destruction
which
awaits
it
if
i
remain
here
much
longer
could
i
insure
them
bread
safety
and
subsistence
not
the
bread
of
idleness
but
that
earned
by
proper
labour
as
heretofore
could
this
be
accomplished
by
the
sacrifice
of
my
life
i
would
willingly
give
it
up
i
attest
before
heaven
that
it
is
only
for
these
i
would
wish
to
live
and
to
toil
for
these
whom
i
have
brought
into
this
miserable
existence
i
resemble
methinks
one
of
the
stones
of
a
ruined
arch
still
retaining
that
pristine
form
that
anciently
fitted
the
place
i
occupied
but
the
centre
is
tumbled
down
i
can
be
nothing
until
i
am
replaced
either
in
the
former
circle
or
in
some
stronger
one
i
see
one
on
a
smaller
scale
and
at
a
considerable
distance
but
it
is
within
my
power
to
reach
it
and
since
i
have
ceased
to
consider
myself
as
a
member
of
the
ancient
state
now
convulsed
i
willingly
descend
into
an
inferior
one
i
will
revert
into
a
state
approaching
nearer
to
that
of
nature
unencumbered
either
with
voluminous
laws
or
contradictory
codes
often
galling
the
very
necks
of
those
whom
they
protect
and
at
the
same
time
sufficiently
remote
from
the
brutality
of
unconnected
savage
nature
do
you
my
friend
perceive
the
path
i
have
found
out
it
is
that
which
leads
to
the
tenants
of
the
great
village
of
where
far
removed
from
the
accursed
neighbourhood
of
europeans
its
inhabitants
live
with
more
ease
decency
and
peace
than
you
imagine
where
though
governed
by
no
laws
yet
find
in
uncontaminated
simple
manners
all
that
laws
can
afford
their
system
is
sufficiently
complete
to
answer
all
the
primary
wants
of
man
and
to
constitute
him
a
social
being
such
as
he
ought
to
be
in
the
great
forest
of
nature
there
it
is
that
i
have
resolved
at
any
rate
to
transport
myself
and
family
an
eccentric
thought
you
may
say
thus
to
cut
asunder
all
former
connections
and
to
form
new
ones
with
a
people
whom
nature
has
stamped
with
such
different
characteristics
but
as
the
happiness
of
my
family
is
the
only
object
of
my
wishes
i
care
very
little
where
we
be
or
where
we
go
provided
that
we
are
safe
and
all
united
together
our
new
calamities
being
shared
equally
by
all
will
become
lighter
our
mutual
affection
for
each
other
will
in
this
great
transmutation
become
the
strongest
link
of
our
new
society
will
afford
us
every
joy
we
can
receive
on
a
foreign
soil
and
preserve
us
in
unity
as
the
gravity
and
coherency
of
matter
prevents
the
world
from
dissolution
blame
me
not
it
would
be
cruel
in
you
it
would
beside
be
entirely
useless
for
when
you
receive
this
we
shall
be
on
the
wing
when
we
think
all
hopes
are
gone
must
we
like
poor
pusillanimous
wretches
despair
and
die
no
i
perceive
before
me
a
few
resources
though
through
many
dangers
which
i
will
explain
to
you
hereafter
it
is
not
believe
me
a
disappointed
ambition
which
leads
me
to
take
this
step
it
is
the
bitterness
of
my
situation
it
is
the
impossibility
of
knowing
what
better
measure
to
adopt
my
education
fitted
me
for
nothing
more
than
the
most
simple
occupations
of
life
i
am
but
a
feller
of
trees
a
cultivator
of
land
the
most
honourable
title
an
american
can
have
i
have
no
exploits
no
discoveries
no
inventions
to
boast
of
i
have
cleared
about
acres
of
land
some
for
the
plough
some
for
the
scythe
and
this
has
occupied
many
years
of
my
life
i
have
never
possessed
or
wish
to
possess
anything
more
than
what
could
be
earned
or
produced
by
the
united
industry
of
my
family
i
wanted
nothing
more
than
to
live
at
home
independent
and
tranquil
and
to
teach
my
children
how
to
provide
the
means
of
a
future
ample
subsistence
founded
on
labour
like
that
of
their
father
this
is
the
career
of
life
i
have
pursued
and
that
which
i
had
marked
out
for
them
and
for
which
they
seemed
to
be
so
well
calculated
by
their
inclinations
and
by
their
constitutions
but
now
these
pleasing
expectations
are
gone
we
must
abandon
the
accumulated
industry
of
nineteen
years
we
must
fly
we
hardly
know
whither
through
the
most
impervious
paths
and
become
members
of
a
new
and
strange
community
oh
virtue
is
this
all
the
reward
thou
hast
to
confer
on
thy
votaries
either
thou
art
only
a
chimera
or
thou
art
a
timid
useless
being
soon
affrighted
when
ambition
thy
great
adversary
dictates
when
war
the
dreadful
sounds
and
poor
helpless
individuals
are
mowed
down
by
its
cruel
reapers
like
useless
grass
i
have
at
all
times
generously
relieved
what
few
distressed
people
i
have
met
with
i
have
encouraged
the
industrious
my
house
has
always
been
opened
to
travellers
i
have
not
lost
a
month
in
illness
since
i
have
been
a
man
i
have
caused
upwards
of
an
hundred
and
twenty
families
to
remove
hither
many
of
them
i
have
led
by
the
hand
in
the
days
of
their
first
trial
distant
as
i
am
from
any
places
of
worship
or
school
of
education
i
have
been
the
pastor
of
my
family
and
the
teacher
of
many
of
my
neighbours
i
have
learnt
them
as
well
as
i
could
the
gratitude
they
owe
to
god
the
father
of
harvests
and
their
duties
to
man
i
have
been
as
useful
a
subject
ever
obedient
to
the
laws
ever
vigilant
to
see
them
respected
and
observed
my
wife
hath
faithfully
followed
the
same
line
within
her
province
no
woman
was
ever
a
better
economist
or
spun
or
wove
better
linen
yet
we
must
perish
perish
like
wild
beasts
included
within
a
ring
of
fire
yes
i
will
cheerfully
embrace
that
resource
it
is
an
holy
inspiration
by
night
and
by
day
it
presents
itself
to
my
mind
i
have
carefully
revolved
the
scheme
i
have
considered
in
all
its
future
effects
and
tendencies
the
new
mode
of
living
we
must
pursue
without
salt
without
spices
without
linen
and
with
little
other
clothing
the
art
of
hunting
we
must
acquire
the
new
manners
we
must
adopt
the
new
language
we
must
speak
the
dangers
attending
the
education
of
my
children
we
must
endure
these
changes
may
appear
more
terrific
at
a
distance
perhaps
than
when
grown
familiar
by
practice
what
is
it
to
us
whether
we
eat
well
made
pastry
or
pounded
alagriches
well
roasted
beef
or
smoked
venison
cabbages
or
squashes
whether
we
wear
neat
or
good
beaver
whether
we
sleep
on
or
on
the
difference
is
not
worth
attending
to
the
difficulty
of
the
language
fear
of
some
great
intoxication
among
the
indians
finally
the
apprehension
lest
my
younger
children
should
be
caught
by
that
singular
charm
so
dangerous
at
their
tender
years
are
the
only
considerations
that
startle
me
by
what
power
does
it
come
to
pass
that
children
who
have
been
adopted
when
young
among
these
people
can
never
be
prevailed
on
to
readopt
european
manners
many
an
anxious
parent
i
have
seen
last
war
who
at
the
return
of
the
peace
went
to
the
indian
villages
where
they
knew
their
children
had
been
carried
in
captivity
when
to
their
inexpressible
sorrow
they
found
them
so
perfectly
indianised
that
many
knew
them
no
longer
and
those
whose
more
advanced
ages
permitted
them
to
recollect
their
fathers
and
mothers
absolutely
refused
to
follow
them
and
ran
to
their
adopted
parents
for
protection
against
the
effusions
of
love
their
unhappy
real
parents
lavished
on
them
incredible
as
this
may
appear
i
have
heard
it
asserted
in
a
thousand
instances
among
persons
of
credit
in
the
village
of
where
i
purpose
to
go
there
lived
about
fifteen
years
ago
an
englishman
and
a
swede
whose
history
would
appear
moving
had
i
time
to
relate
it
they
were
grown
to
the
age
of
men
when
they
were
taken
they
happily
escaped
the
great
punishment
of
war
captives
and
were
obliged
to
marry
the
squaws
who
had
saved
their
lives
by
adoption
by
the
force
of
habit
they
became
at
last
thoroughly
naturalised
to
this
wild
course
of
life
while
i
was
there
their
friends
sent
them
a
considerable
sum
of
money
to
ransom
themselves
with
the
indians
their
old
masters
gave
them
their
choice
and
without
requiring
any
consideration
told
them
that
they
had
been
long
as
free
as
themselves
they
chose
to
remain
and
the
reasons
they
gave
me
would
greatly
surprise
you
the
most
perfect
freedom
the
ease
of
living
the
absence
of
those
cares
and
corroding
solicitudes
which
so
often
prevail
with
us
the
peculiar
goodness
of
the
soil
they
cultivated
for
they
did
not
trust
altogether
to
hunting
all
these
and
many
more
motives
which
i
have
forgot
made
them
prefer
that
life
of
which
we
entertain
such
dreadful
opinions
it
can
not
be
therefore
so
bad
as
we
generally
conceive
it
to
be
there
must
be
in
their
social
bond
something
singularly
captivating
and
far
superior
to
anything
to
be
boasted
of
among
us
for
thousands
of
europeans
are
indians
and
we
have
no
examples
of
even
one
of
those
aborigines
having
from
choice
become
europeans
there
must
be
something
more
congenial
to
our
native
dispositions
than
the
fictitious
society
in
which
we
live
or
else
why
should
children
and
even
grown
persons
become
in
a
short
time
so
invincibly
attached
to
it
there
must
be
something
very
bewitching
in
their
manners
something
very
indelible
and
marked
by
the
very
hands
of
nature
for
take
a
young
indian
lad
give
him
the
best
education
you
possibly
can
load
him
with
your
bounty
with
presents
nay
with
riches
yet
he
will
secretly
long
for
his
native
woods
which
you
would
imagine
he
must
have
long
since
forgot
and
on
the
first
opportunity
he
can
possibly
find
you
will
see
him
voluntarily
leave
behind
him
all
you
have
given
him
and
return
with
inexpressible
joy
to
lie
on
the
mats
of
his
fathers
some
years
ago
received
from
a
good
old
indian
who
died
in
his
house
a
young
lad
of
nine
years
of
age
his
grandson
he
kindly
educated
him
with
his
children
and
bestowed
on
him
the
same
care
and
attention
in
respect
to
the
memory
of
his
venerable
grandfather
who
was
a
worthy
man
he
intended
to
give
him
a
genteel
trade
but
in
the
spring
season
when
all
the
family
went
to
the
woods
to
make
their
maple
sugar
he
suddenly
disappeared
and
it
was
not
until
seventeen
months
after
that
his
benefactor
heard
he
had
reached
the
village
of
bald
eagle
where
he
still
dwelt
let
us
say
what
we
will
of
them
of
their
inferior
organs
of
their
want
of
bread
they
are
as
stout
and
well
made
as
the
europeans
without
temples
without
priests
without
kings
and
without
laws
they
are
in
many
instances
superior
to
us
and
the
proofs
of
what
i
advance
are
that
they
live
without
care
sleep
without
inquietude
take
life
as
it
comes
bearing
all
its
asperities
with
unparalleled
patience
and
die
without
any
kind
of
apprehension
for
what
they
have
done
or
for
what
they
expect
to
meet
with
hereafter
what
system
of
philosophy
can
give
us
so
many
necessary
qualifications
for
happiness
they
most
certainly
are
much
more
closely
connected
with
nature
than
we
are
they
are
her
immediate
children
the
inhabitants
of
the
woods
are
her
undefiled
those
of
the
plains
are
her
degenerated
breed
far
very
far
removed
from
her
primitive
laws
from
her
original
design
it
is
therefore
resolved
on
i
will
either
die
in
the
attempt
or
succeed
better
perish
all
together
in
one
fatal
hour
than
to
suffer
what
we
daily
endure
i
do
not
expect
to
enjoy
in
the
village
of
an
uninterrupted
happiness
it
can
not
be
our
lot
let
us
live
where
we
will
i
am
not
founding
my
future
prosperity
on
golden
dreams
place
mankind
where
you
will
they
must
always
have
adverse
circumstances
to
struggle
with
from
nature
accidents
constitution
from
seasons
from
that
great
combination
of
mischances
which
perpetually
lead
us
to
new
diseases
to
poverty
etc
who
knows
but
i
may
meet
in
this
new
situation
some
accident
from
whence
may
spring
up
new
sources
of
unexpected
prosperity
who
can
be
presumptuous
enough
to
predict
all
the
good
who
can
foresee
all
the
evils
which
strew
the
paths
of
our
lives
but
after
all
i
can
not
but
recollect
what
sacrifice
i
am
going
to
make
what
amputation
i
am
going
to
suffer
what
transition
i
am
going
to
experience
pardon
my
repetitions
my
wild
my
trifling
reflections
they
proceed
from
the
agitations
of
my
mind
and
the
fulness
of
my
heart
the
action
of
thus
retracing
them
seems
to
lighten
the
burden
and
to
exhilarate
my
spirits
this
is
besides
the
last
letter
you
will
receive
from
me
i
would
fain
tell
you
all
though
i
hardly
know
how
oh
in
the
hours
in
the
moments
of
my
greatest
anguish
could
i
intuitively
represent
to
you
that
variety
of
thought
which
crowds
on
my
mind
you
would
have
reason
to
be
surprised
and
to
doubt
of
their
possibility
shall
we
ever
meet
again
if
we
should
where
will
it
be
on
the
wild
shores
of
if
it
be
my
doom
to
end
my
days
there
i
will
greatly
improve
them
and
perhaps
make
room
for
a
few
more
families
who
will
choose
to
retire
from
the
fury
of
a
storm
the
agitated
billows
of
which
will
yet
roar
for
many
years
on
our
extended
shores
perhaps
i
may
repossess
my
house
if
it
be
not
burnt
down
but
how
will
my
improvements
look
why
half
defaced
bearing
the
strong
marks
of
abandonment
and
of
the
ravages
of
war
however
at
present
i
give
everything
over
for
lost
i
will
bid
a
long
farewell
to
what
i
leave
behind
if
ever
i
repossess
it
i
shall
receive
it
as
a
gift
as
a
reward
for
my
conduct
and
fortitude
do
not
imagine
however
that
i
am
a
stoic
by
no
means
i
must
on
the
contrary
confess
to
you
that
i
feel
the
keenest
regret
at
abandoning
an
house
which
i
have
in
some
measure
reared
with
my
own
hands
yes
perhaps
i
may
never
revisit
those
fields
which
i
have
cleared
those
trees
which
i
have
planted
those
meadows
which
in
my
youth
were
a
hideous
wilderness
now
converted
by
my
industry
into
rich
pastures
and
pleasant
lawns
if
in
europe
it
is
to
be
attached
to
paternal
inheritances
how
much
more
natural
how
much
more
powerful
must
the
tie
be
with
us
who
if
i
may
be
permitted
the
expression
are
the
founders
the
creators
of
our
own
farms
when
i
see
my
table
surrounded
with
my
blooming
offspring
all
united
in
the
bonds
of
the
strongest
affection
it
kindles
in
my
paternal
heart
a
variety
of
tumultuous
sentiments
which
none
but
a
father
and
a
husband
in
my
situation
can
feel
or
describe
perhaps
i
may
see
my
wife
my
children
often
distressed
involuntarily
recalling
to
their
minds
the
ease
and
abundance
which
they
enjoyed
under
the
paternal
roof
perhaps
i
may
see
them
want
that
bread
which
i
now
leave
behind
overtaken
by
diseases
and
penury
rendered
more
bitter
by
the
recollection
of
former
days
of
opulence
and
plenty
perhaps
i
may
be
assailed
on
every
side
by
unforeseen
accidents
which
i
shall
not
be
able
to
prevent
or
to
alleviate
can
i
contemplate
such
images
without
the
most
unutterable
emotions
my
fate
is
determined
but
i
have
not
determined
it
you
may
assure
yourself
without
having
undergone
the
most
painful
conflicts
of
a
variety
of
passions
interest
love
of
ease
disappointed
views
and
pleasing
expectations
frustrated
i
shuddered
at
the
review
would
to
god
i
was
master
of
the
stoical
tranquillity
of
that
magnanimous
sect
oh
that
i
were
possessed
of
those
sublime
lessons
which
appollonius
of
chalcis
gave
to
the
emperor
antoninus
i
could
then
with
much
more
propriety
guide
the
helm
of
my
little
bark
which
is
soon
to
be
freighted
with
all
that
i
possess
most
dear
on
earth
through
this
stormy
passage
to
a
safe
harbour
and
when
there
become
to
my
fellow
passengers
a
surer
guide
a
brighter
example
a
pattern
more
worthy
of
imitation
throughout
all
the
new
scenes
they
must
pass
and
the
new
career
they
must
traverse
i
have
observed
notwithstanding
the
means
hitherto
made
use
of
to
arm
the
principal
nations
against
our
frontiers
yet
they
have
not
they
will
not
take
up
the
hatchet
against
a
people
who
have
done
them
no
harm
the
passions
necessary
to
urge
these
people
to
war
can
not
be
roused
they
can
not
feel
the
stings
of
vengeance
the
thirst
of
which
alone
can
compel
them
to
shed
blood
far
superior
in
their
motives
of
action
to
the
europeans
who
for
sixpence
per
day
may
be
engaged
to
shed
that
of
any
people
on
earth
they
know
nothing
of
the
nature
of
our
disputes
they
have
no
ideas
of
such
revolutions
as
this
a
civil
division
of
a
village
or
tribe
are
events
which
have
never
been
recorded
in
their
traditions
many
of
them
know
very
well
that
they
have
too
long
been
the
dupes
and
the
victims
of
both
parties
foolishly
arming
for
our
sakes
sometimes
against
each
other
sometimes
against
our
white
enemies
they
consider
us
as
born
on
the
same
land
and
though
they
have
no
reasons
to
love
us
yet
they
seem
carefully
to
avoid
entering
into
this
quarrel
from
whatever
motives
i
am
speaking
of
those
nations
with
which
i
am
best
acquainted
a
few
hundreds
of
the
worst
kind
mixed
with
whites
worse
than
themselves
are
now
hired
by
great
britain
to
perpetuate
those
dreadful
incursions
in
my
youth
i
traded
with
the
under
the
conduct
of
my
uncle
and
always
traded
justly
and
equitably
some
of
them
remember
it
to
this
day
happily
their
village
is
far
removed
from
the
dangerous
neighbourhood
of
the
whites
i
sent
a
man
last
spring
to
it
who
understands
the
woods
extremely
well
and
who
speaks
their
language
he
is
just
returned
after
several
weeks
absence
and
has
brought
me
as
i
had
flattered
myself
a
string
of
thirty
purple
wampum
as
a
token
that
their
honest
chief
will
spare
us
half
of
his
wigwam
until
we
have
time
to
erect
one
he
has
sent
me
word
that
they
have
land
in
plenty
of
which
they
are
not
so
covetous
as
the
whites
that
we
may
plant
for
ourselves
and
that
in
the
meantime
he
will
procure
for
us
some
corn
and
some
meat
that
fish
is
plenty
in
the
waters
of
and
that
the
village
to
which
he
had
laid
open
my
proposals
have
no
objection
to
our
becoming
dwellers
with
them
i
have
not
yet
communicated
these
glad
tidings
to
my
wife
nor
do
i
know
how
to
do
it
i
tremble
lest
she
should
refuse
to
follow
me
lest
the
sudden
idea
of
this
removal
rushing
on
her
mind
might
be
too
powerful
i
flatter
myself
i
shall
be
able
to
accomplish
it
and
to
prevail
on
her
i
fear
nothing
but
the
effects
of
her
strong
attachment
to
her
relations
i
will
willingly
let
you
know
how
i
purpose
to
remove
my
family
to
so
great
a
distance
but
it
would
become
unintelligible
to
you
because
you
are
not
acquainted
with
the
geographical
situation
of
this
part
of
the
country
suffice
it
for
you
to
know
that
with
about
miles
land
carriage
i
am
enabled
to
perform
the
rest
by
water
and
when
once
afloat
i
care
not
whether
it
be
two
or
three
hundred
miles
i
propose
to
send
all
our
provisions
furniture
and
clothes
to
my
wife
father
who
approves
of
the
scheme
and
to
reserve
nothing
but
a
few
necessary
articles
of
covering
trusting
to
the
furs
of
the
chase
for
our
future
apparel
were
we
imprudently
to
encumber
ourselves
too
much
with
baggage
we
should
never
reach
to
the
waters
of
which
is
the
most
dangerous
as
well
as
the
most
difficult
part
of
our
journey
and
yet
but
a
trifle
in
point
of
distance
i
intend
to
say
to
my
negroes
in
the
name
of
god
be
free
my
honest
lads
i
thank
you
for
your
past
services
go
from
henceforth
and
work
for
yourselves
look
on
me
as
your
old
friend
and
fellow
labourer
be
sober
frugal
and
industrious
and
you
need
not
fear
earning
a
comfortable
lest
my
countrymen
should
think
that
i
am
gone
to
join
the
incendiaries
of
our
frontiers
i
intend
to
write
a
letter
to
to
inform
him
of
our
retreat
and
of
the
reasons
that
have
urged
me
to
it
the
man
whom
i
sent
to
village
is
to
accompany
us
also
and
a
very
useful
companion
he
will
be
on
every
account
you
may
therefore
by
means
of
anticipation
behold
me
under
the
wigwam
i
am
so
well
acquainted
with
the
principal
manners
of
these
people
that
i
entertain
not
the
least
apprehension
from
them
i
rely
more
securely
on
their
strong
hospitality
than
on
the
witnessed
compacts
of
many
europeans
as
soon
as
possible
after
my
arrival
i
design
to
build
myself
a
wigwam
after
the
same
manner
and
size
with
the
rest
in
order
to
avoid
being
thought
singular
or
giving
occasion
for
any
railleries
though
these
people
are
seldom
guilty
of
such
european
follies
i
shall
erect
it
hard
by
the
lands
which
they
propose
to
allot
me
and
will
endeavour
that
my
wife
my
children
and
myself
may
be
adopted
soon
after
our
arrival
thus
becoming
truly
inhabitants
of
their
village
we
shall
immediately
occupy
that
rank
within
the
pale
of
their
society
which
will
afford
us
all
the
amends
we
can
possibly
expect
for
the
loss
we
have
met
with
by
the
convulsions
of
our
own
according
to
their
customs
we
shall
likewise
receive
names
from
them
by
which
we
shall
always
be
known
my
youngest
children
shall
learn
to
swim
and
to
shoot
with
the
bow
that
they
may
acquire
such
talents
as
will
necessarily
raise
them
into
some
degree
of
esteem
among
the
indian
lads
of
their
own
age
the
rest
of
us
must
hunt
with
the
hunters
i
have
been
for
several
years
an
expert
marksman
but
i
dread
lest
the
imperceptible
charm
of
indian
education
may
seize
my
younger
children
and
give
them
such
a
propensity
to
that
mode
of
life
as
may
preclude
their
returning
to
the
manners
and
customs
of
their
parents
i
have
but
one
remedy
to
prevent
this
great
evil
and
that
is
to
employ
them
in
the
labour
of
the
fields
as
much
as
i
can
i
am
even
resolved
to
make
their
daily
subsistence
depend
altogether
on
it
as
long
as
we
keep
ourselves
busy
in
tilling
the
earth
there
is
no
fear
of
any
of
us
becoming
wild
it
is
the
chase
and
the
food
it
procures
that
have
this
strange
effect
excuse
a
simile
those
hogs
which
range
in
the
woods
and
to
whom
grain
is
given
once
a
week
preserve
their
former
degree
of
tameness
but
if
on
the
contrary
they
are
reduced
to
live
on
ground
nuts
and
on
what
they
can
get
they
soon
become
wild
and
fierce
for
my
part
i
can
plough
sow
and
hunt
as
occasion
may
require
but
my
wife
deprived
of
wool
and
flax
will
have
no
room
for
industry
what
is
she
then
to
do
like
the
other
squaws
she
must
cook
for
us
the
nasaump
the
ninchicke
and
such
other
preparations
of
corn
as
are
customary
among
these
people
she
must
learn
to
bake
squashes
and
pumpkins
under
the
ashes
to
slice
and
smoke
the
meat
of
our
own
killing
in
order
to
preserve
it
she
must
cheerfully
adopt
the
manners
and
customs
of
her
neighbours
in
their
dress
deportment
conduct
and
internal
economy
in
all
respects
surely
if
we
can
have
fortitude
enough
to
quit
all
we
have
to
remove
so
far
and
to
associate
with
people
so
different
from
us
these
necessary
compliances
are
but
part
of
the
scheme
the
change
of
garments
when
those
they
carry
with
them
are
worn
out
will
not
be
the
least
of
my
wife
and
daughter
concerns
though
i
am
in
hopes
that
will
invent
some
sort
of
reparation
perhaps
you
would
not
believe
that
there
are
in
the
woods
glasses
and
paint
of
every
colour
and
that
the
inhabitants
take
as
much
pains
to
adorn
their
faces
and
their
bodies
to
fix
their
bracelets
of
silver
and
plait
their
hair
as
our
forefathers
the
picts
used
to
do
in
the
time
of
the
romans
not
that
i
would
wish
to
see
either
my
wife
or
daughter
adopt
those
savage
customs
we
can
live
in
great
peace
and
harmony
with
them
without
descending
to
every
article
the
interruption
of
trade
hath
i
hope
suspended
this
mode
of
dress
my
wife
understands
inoculation
perfectly
well
she
inoculated
all
our
children
one
after
another
and
has
successfully
performed
the
operation
on
several
scores
of
people
who
scattered
here
and
there
through
our
woods
were
too
far
removed
from
all
medical
assistance
if
we
can
persuade
but
one
family
to
submit
to
it
and
it
succeeds
we
shall
then
be
as
happy
as
our
situation
will
admit
of
it
will
raise
her
into
some
degree
of
consideration
for
whoever
is
useful
in
any
society
will
always
be
respected
if
we
are
so
fortunate
as
to
carry
one
family
through
a
disorder
which
is
the
plague
among
these
people
i
trust
to
the
force
of
example
we
shall
then
become
truly
necessary
valued
and
beloved
we
indeed
owe
every
kind
office
to
a
society
of
men
who
so
readily
offer
to
assist
us
into
their
social
partnership
and
to
extend
to
my
family
the
shelter
of
their
village
the
strength
of
their
adoption
and
even
the
dignity
of
their
names
god
grant
us
a
prosperous
beginning
we
may
then
hope
to
be
of
more
service
to
them
than
even
missionaries
who
have
been
sent
to
preach
to
them
a
gospel
they
can
not
understand
as
to
religion
our
mode
of
worship
will
not
suffer
much
by
this
removal
from
a
cultivated
country
into
the
bosom
of
the
woods
for
it
can
not
be
much
simpler
than
that
which
we
have
followed
here
these
many
years
and
i
will
with
as
much
care
as
i
can
redouble
my
attention
and
twice
a
week
retrace
to
them
the
great
outlines
of
their
duty
to
god
and
to
man
i
will
read
and
expound
to
them
some
part
of
the
decalogue
which
is
the
method
i
have
pursued
ever
since
i
married
half
a
dozen
of
acres
on
the
shores
of
the
soil
of
which
i
know
well
will
yield
us
a
great
abundance
of
all
we
want
i
will
make
it
a
point
to
give
the
to
such
indians
as
shall
be
most
unfortunate
in
their
huntings
i
will
persuade
them
if
i
can
to
till
a
little
more
land
than
they
do
and
not
to
trust
so
much
to
the
produce
of
the
chase
to
encourage
them
still
farther
i
will
give
a
quirn
to
every
six
families
i
have
built
many
for
our
poor
back
settlers
it
being
often
the
want
of
mills
which
prevents
them
from
raising
grain
as
i
am
a
carpenter
i
can
build
my
own
plough
and
can
be
of
great
service
to
many
of
them
my
example
alone
may
rouse
the
industry
of
some
and
serve
to
direct
others
in
their
labours
the
difficulties
of
the
language
will
soon
be
removed
in
my
evening
conversations
i
will
endeavour
to
make
them
regulate
the
trade
of
their
village
in
such
a
manner
as
that
those
pests
of
the
continent
those
indian
traders
may
not
come
within
a
certain
distance
and
there
they
shall
be
obliged
to
transact
their
business
before
the
old
people
i
am
in
hopes
that
the
constant
respect
which
is
paid
to
the
elders
and
shame
may
prevent
the
young
hunters
from
infringing
this
regulation
the
son
of
will
soon
be
made
acquainted
with
our
schemes
and
i
trust
that
the
power
of
love
and
the
strong
attachment
he
professes
for
my
daughter
may
bring
him
along
with
us
he
will
make
an
excellent
hunter
young
and
vigorous
he
will
equal
in
dexterity
the
stoutest
man
in
the
village
had
it
not
been
for
this
fortunate
circumstance
there
would
have
been
the
greatest
danger
for
however
i
respect
the
simple
the
inoffensive
society
of
these
people
in
their
villages
the
strongest
prejudices
would
make
me
abhor
any
alliance
with
them
in
blood
disagreeable
no
doubt
to
nature
intentions
which
have
strongly
divided
us
by
so
many
indelible
characters
in
the
days
of
our
sickness
we
shall
have
recourse
to
their
medical
knowledge
which
is
well
calculated
for
the
simple
diseases
to
which
they
are
subject
thus
shall
we
metamorphose
ourselves
from
neat
decent
opulent
planters
surrounded
with
every
conveniency
which
our
external
labour
and
internal
industry
could
give
into
a
still
simpler
people
divested
of
everything
beside
hope
food
and
the
raiment
of
the
woods
abandoning
the
large
framed
house
to
dwell
under
the
wigwam
and
the
featherbed
to
lie
on
the
mat
or
bear
skin
there
shall
we
sleep
undisturbed
by
fruitful
dreams
and
apprehensions
rest
and
peace
of
mind
will
make
us
the
most
ample
amends
for
what
we
shall
leave
behind
these
blessings
can
not
be
purchased
too
dear
too
long
have
we
been
deprived
of
them
i
would
cheerfully
go
even
to
the
mississippi
to
find
that
repose
to
which
we
have
been
so
long
strangers
my
heart
sometimes
seems
tired
with
beating
it
wants
rest
like
my
which
feel
oppressed
with
so
many
watchings
these
are
the
component
parts
of
my
scheme
the
success
of
each
of
which
appears
feasible
from
whence
i
flatter
myself
with
the
probable
success
of
the
whole
still
the
danger
of
indian
education
returns
to
my
mind
and
alarms
me
much
then
again
i
contrast
it
with
the
education
of
the
times
both
appear
to
be
equally
pregnant
with
evils
reason
points
out
the
necessity
of
choosing
the
least
dangerous
which
i
must
consider
as
the
only
good
within
my
reach
i
persuade
myself
that
industry
and
labour
will
be
a
sovereign
preservative
against
the
dangers
of
the
former
but
i
consider
at
the
same
time
that
the
share
of
labour
and
industry
which
is
intended
to
procure
but
a
simple
subsistence
with
hardly
any
superfluity
can
not
have
the
same
restrictive
effects
on
our
minds
as
when
we
tilled
the
earth
on
a
more
extensive
scale
the
surplus
could
be
then
realised
into
solid
wealth
and
at
the
same
time
that
this
realisation
rewarded
our
past
labours
it
engrossed
and
fixed
the
attention
of
the
labourer
and
cherished
in
his
mind
the
hope
of
future
riches
in
order
to
supply
this
great
deficiency
of
industrious
motives
and
to
hold
out
to
them
a
real
object
to
prevent
the
fatal
consequences
of
this
sort
of
apathy
i
will
keep
an
exact
account
of
all
that
shall
be
gathered
and
give
each
of
them
a
regular
credit
for
the
amount
of
it
to
be
paid
them
in
real
property
at
the
return
of
peace
thus
though
seemingly
toiling
for
bare
subsistence
on
a
foreign
land
they
shall
entertain
the
pleasing
prospect
of
seeing
the
sum
of
their
labours
one
day
realised
either
in
legacies
or
gifts
equal
if
not
superior
to
it
the
yearly
expense
of
the
clothes
which
they
would
have
received
at
home
and
of
which
they
will
then
be
deprived
shall
likewise
be
added
to
their
credit
thus
i
flatter
myself
that
they
will
more
cheerfully
wear
the
blanket
the
matchcoat
and
the
moccasins
whatever
success
they
may
meet
with
in
hunting
or
fishing
shall
only
be
considered
as
recreation
and
pastime
i
shall
thereby
prevent
them
from
estimating
their
skill
in
the
chase
as
an
important
and
necessary
accomplishment
i
mean
to
say
to
them
you
shall
hunt
and
fish
merely
to
show
your
new
companions
that
you
are
not
inferior
to
them
in
point
of
sagacity
and
dexterity
were
i
to
send
them
to
such
schools
as
the
interior
parts
of
our
settlements
afford
at
present
what
can
they
learn
there
how
could
i
support
them
there
what
must
become
of
me
am
i
to
proceed
on
my
voyage
and
leave
them
that
i
never
could
submit
to
instead
of
the
perpetual
discordant
noise
of
disputes
so
common
among
us
instead
of
those
scolding
scenes
frequent
in
every
house
they
will
observe
nothing
but
silence
at
home
and
abroad
a
singular
appearance
of
peace
and
concord
are
the
first
characteristics
which
strike
you
in
the
villages
of
these
people
nothing
can
be
more
pleasing
nothing
surprises
an
european
so
much
as
the
silence
and
harmony
which
prevails
among
them
and
in
each
family
except
when
disturbed
by
that
accursed
spirit
given
them
by
the
wood
rangers
in
exchange
for
their
furs
if
my
children
learn
nothing
of
geometrical
rules
the
use
of
the
compass
or
of
the
latin
tongue
they
will
learn
and
practise
sobriety
for
rum
can
no
longer
be
sent
to
these
people
they
will
learn
that
modesty
and
diffidence
for
which
the
young
indians
are
so
remarkable
they
will
consider
labour
as
the
most
essential
qualification
hunting
as
the
second
they
will
prepare
themselves
in
the
prosecution
of
our
small
rural
schemes
carried
on
for
the
benefit
of
our
little
community
to
extend
them
further
when
each
shall
receive
his
inheritance
their
tender
minds
will
cease
to
be
agitated
by
perpetual
alarms
to
be
made
cowards
by
continual
terrors
if
they
acquire
in
the
village
of
such
an
awkwardness
of
deportment
and
appearance
as
would
render
them
ridiculous
in
our
gay
capitals
they
will
imbibe
i
hope
a
confirmed
taste
for
that
simplicity
which
so
well
becomes
the
cultivators
of
the
land
if
i
can
not
teach
them
any
of
those
professions
which
sometimes
embellish
and
support
our
society
i
will
show
them
how
to
hew
wood
how
to
construct
their
own
ploughs
and
with
a
few
tools
how
to
supply
themselves
with
every
necessary
implement
both
in
the
house
and
in
the
field
if
they
are
hereafter
obliged
to
confess
that
they
belong
to
no
one
particular
church
i
shall
have
the
consolation
of
teaching
them
that
great
that
primary
worship
which
is
the
foundation
of
all
others
if
they
do
not
fear
god
according
to
the
tenets
of
any
one
seminary
they
shall
learn
to
worship
him
upon
the
broad
scale
of
nature
the
supreme
being
does
not
reside
in
peculiar
churches
or
communities
he
is
equally
the
great
manitou
of
the
woods
and
of
the
plains
and
even
in
the
gloom
the
obscurity
of
those
very
woods
his
justice
may
be
as
well
understood
and
felt
as
in
the
most
sumptuous
temples
each
worship
with
us
hath
you
know
its
peculiar
political
tendency
there
it
has
none
but
to
inspire
gratitude
and
truth
their
tender
minds
shall
receive
no
other
idea
of
the
supreme
being
than
that
of
the
father
of
all
men
who
requires
nothing
more
of
us
than
what
tends
to
make
each
other
happy
we
shall
say
with
them
soungwaneha
esa
caurounkyawga
nughwonshauza
neattewek
our
father
be
thy
will
done
in
earth
as
it
is
in
great
heaven
perhaps
my
imagination
gilds
too
strongly
this
distant
prospect
yet
it
appears
founded
on
so
few
and
simple
principles
that
there
is
not
the
same
probability
of
adverse
incidents
as
in
more
complex
schemes
these
vague
rambling
contemplations
which
i
here
faithfully
retrace
carry
me
sometimes
to
a
great
distance
i
am
lost
in
the
anticipation
of
the
various
circumstances
attending
this
proposed
metamorphosis
many
unforeseen
accidents
may
doubtless
arise
alas
it
is
easier
for
me
in
all
the
glow
of
paternal
anxiety
reclined
on
my
bed
to
form
the
theory
of
my
future
conduct
than
to
reduce
my
schemes
into
practice
but
when
once
secluded
from
the
great
society
to
which
we
now
belong
we
shall
unite
closer
together
and
there
will
be
less
room
for
jealousies
or
contentions
as
i
intend
my
children
neither
for
the
law
nor
the
church
but
for
the
cultivation
of
the
land
i
wish
them
no
literary
accomplishments
i
pray
heaven
that
they
may
be
one
day
nothing
more
than
expert
scholars
in
husbandry
this
is
the
science
which
made
our
continent
to
flourish
more
rapidly
than
any
other
were
they
to
grow
up
where
i
am
now
situated
even
admitting
that
we
were
in
safety
two
of
them
are
verging
toward
that
period
in
their
lives
when
they
must
necessarily
take
up
the
musket
and
learn
in
that
new
school
all
the
vices
which
are
so
common
in
armies
great
god
close
my
eyes
for
ever
rather
than
i
should
live
to
see
this
calamity
may
they
rather
become
inhabitants
of
the
woods
thus
then
in
the
village
of
in
the
bosom
of
that
peace
it
has
enjoyed
ever
since
i
have
known
it
connected
with
mild
hospitable
people
strangers
to
our
political
disputes
and
having
none
among
themselves
on
the
shores
of
a
fine
river
surrounded
with
woods
abounding
with
game
our
little
society
united
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
new
adoptive
one
in
which
we
shall
be
incorporated
shall
rest
i
hope
from
all
fatigues
from
all
apprehensions
from
our
perfect
terrors
and
from
our
long
watchings
not
a
word
of
politics
shall
cloud
our
simple
conversation
tired
either
with
the
chase
or
the
labour
of
the
field
we
shall
sleep
on
our
mats
without
any
distressing
want
having
learnt
to
retrench
every
superfluous
one
we
shall
have
but
two
prayers
to
make
to
the
supreme
being
that
he
may
shed
his
fertilising
dew
on
our
little
crops
and
that
he
will
be
pleased
to
restore
peace
to
our
unhappy
country
these
shall
be
the
only
subject
of
our
nightly
prayers
and
of
our
daily
ejaculations
and
if
the
labour
the
industry
the
frugality
the
union
of
men
can
be
an
agreeable
offering
to
him
we
shall
not
fail
to
receive
his
paternal
blessings
there
i
shall
contemplate
nature
in
her
most
wild
and
ample
extent
i
shall
carefully
study
a
species
of
society
of
which
i
have
at
present
but
very
imperfect
ideas
i
will
endeavour
to
occupy
with
propriety
that
place
which
will
enable
me
to
enjoy
the
few
and
sufficient
benefits
it
confers
the
solitary
and
unconnected
mode
of
life
i
have
lived
in
my
youth
must
fit
me
for
this
trial
i
am
not
the
first
who
has
attempted

not
it
is
true
carry
to
the
wilderness
numerous
families
they
went
there
as
mere
speculators
i
as
a
man
seeking
a
refuge
from
the
desolation
of
war
they
went
there
to
study
the
manner
of
the
aborigines
i
to
conform
to
them
whatever
they
are
some
went
as
visitors
as
travellers
i
as
a
sojourner
as
a
fellow

and
labourer

determined
industriously
to
work
up
among
them
such
a
system
of
happiness
as
may
be
adequate
to
my
future
situation
and
may
be
a
sufficient
compensation
for
all
my
fatigues
and
for
the
misfortunes
i
have
borne
i
have
always
found
it
at
home
i
may
hope
likewise
to
find
it
under
the
humble
roof
of
my
wigwam
o
supreme
being
if
among
the
immense
variety
of
planets
inhabited
by
thy
creative
power
thy
paternal
and
omnipotent
care

extend
to
all
the
individuals

it
be
not
beneath
thy
infinite
dignity
to
cast
thy
eye
on
us
wretched
mortals

felicity

poor
afflicted
country

fierce
storm

so
long
ravaged

i
beseech
thee
o
father
of
nature
that
our
ancient
virtues
and
our
industry
may
not
be
totally
lost
and
that
as
a
reward
for
the
great
toils
we
have
made
on
this
new
land
we
may
be
restored
to
our
ancient
tranquillity
and
enabled
to
fill
it
with
successive
generations
that
will
constantly
thank
thee
for
the
ample
subsistence
thou
hast
given
them
the
unreserved
manner
in
which
i
have
written

give
you
a
convincing
proof
of
that
friendship
and
esteem
of
which
i
am
sure
you
never
yet
doubted
as
members
of
the
same
society
as
mutually
bound
by
the
ties
of
affection
and
old
acquaintance
you
certainly
can
not
avoid
feeling
for
my
distresses
you
can
not
avoid
mourning
with
me
over
that
load
of
physical
and
moral
evil
with
which
we
are
all
oppressed
my
own
share
of
it
i
often
overlook
when
i
minutely
contemplate
all
that
hath
befallen
our
native
country
