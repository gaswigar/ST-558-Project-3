there

is
they
would
cry
it
was
aunt
clotilde
who
had
sunk
forward
while
kneeling
at
prayer
the
villagers
did
not
stand
in
awe
of
her
uncle
bertrand
said
the
child
clasping
her
hands
why

that

asked
gently
her
strength
deserted
her
she
fell
upon
her
knees
in
the
snow

exclaimed
fairyfoot
i
surprised
what
the
matter
with
the
swine
he
asked
almost
immediately
they
found
themselves
in
a
beautiful
little
dell
fairyfoot
loved
her
in
a
moment
and
he
knelt
on
one
knee
there
the
cake
he
said
eh
eh
he
said
what
what
who
this
tootsicums
little
saint
elizabeth
she
had
not
been
brought
up
in
america
at
all
she
had
been
born
in
france
in
a
beautiful
and
she
had
been
born
heiress
to
a
great
fortune
but
nevertheless
just
now
she
felt
as
if
she
was
very
poor
indeed
and
yet
her
home
was
in
one
of
the
most
splendid
houses
in
new
york
she
had
a
lovely
suite
of
apartments
of
her
own
though
she
was
only
eleven
years
old
she
had
had
her
own
carriage
and
a
saddle
horse
a
train
of
masters
and
governesses
and
servants
and
was
regarded
by
all
the
children
of
the
neighborhood
as
a
sort
of
grand
and
mysterious
little
princess
whose
incomings
and
outgoings
were
to
be
watched
with
the
greatest
interest
there
she
is
they
would
cry
flying
to
their
windows
to
look
at
her
she
is
going
out
in
her
carriage
she
is
dressed
all
in
black
velvet
and
splendid
fur
that
is
her
own
own
carriage
she
has
millions
of
money
and
she
can
have
anything
she
wants
jane
says
so
she
is
very
pretty
too
but
she
is
so
pale
and
has
such
big
sorrowful
black
eyes
i
should
not
be
sorrowful
if
i
were
in
her
place
but
jane
says
the
servants
say
she
is
always
quiet
and
looks
sad
her
maid
says
she
lived
with
her
aunt
and
her
aunt
made
her
too
religious
she
rarely
lifted
her
large
dark
eyes
to
look
at
them
with
any
curiosity
she
was
not
accustomed
to
the
society
of
children
she
had
never
had
a
child
companion
in
her
life
and
these
little
americans
who
were
so
very
rosy
and
gay
and
who
went
out
to
walk
or
drive
with
groups
of
brothers
and
sisters
and
even
ran
in
the
street
laughing
and
playing
and
squabbling
healthily
these
children
amazed
her
poor
little
saint
elizabeth
she
had
not
lived
a
very
natural
or
healthy
life
herself
and
she
knew
absolutely
nothing
of
real
childish
pleasures
you
see
it
had
occurred
in
this
way
when
she
was
a
baby
of
two
years
her
young
father
and
mother
died
within
a
week
of
each
other
of
a
terrible
fever
and
the
only
near
relatives
the
little
one
had
were
her
aunt
clotilde
and
uncle
bertrand
her
aunt
clotilde
lived
in
normandy
her
uncle
bertrand
in
new
york
as
these
two
were
her
only
guardians
and
as
bertrand
de
rochemont
was
a
gay
bachelor
fond
of
pleasure
and
knowing
nothing
of
babies
it
was
natural
that
he
should
be
very
willing
that
his
elder
sister
should
undertake
the
rearing
and
education
of
the
child
only
he
wrote
to
mademoiselle
de
rochemont
do
end
by
training
her
for
an
abbess
my
dear
clotilde
illustration
there
she
is
they
would
cry
there
was
a
very
great
difference
between
these
two
people
the
distance
between
the
gray
stone
in
normandy
and
the
brown
stone
mansion
in
new
york
was
not
nearly
so
great
as
the
distance
and
difference
between
the
two
lives
and
yet
it
was
said
that
in
her
first
youth
mademoiselle
de
rochemont
had
been
as
gay
and
fond
of
pleasure
as
either
of
her
brothers
and
then
when
her
life
was
at
its
brightest
and
gayest
when
she
was
a
beautiful
and
brilliant
young
woman
she
had
had
a
great
and
bitter
sorrow
which
had
changed
her
for
ever
from
that
time
she
had
never
left
the
house
in
which
she
had
been
born
and
had
lived
the
life
of
a
nun
in
everything
but
being
enclosed
in
convent
walls
at
first
she
had
had
her
parents
to
take
care
of
but
when
they
died
she
had
been
left
entirely
alone
in
the
great
and
devoted
herself
to
prayer
and
works
of
charity
among
the
villagers
and
country
people
ah
she
is
good
she
is
a
saint
mademoiselle
the
poor
people
always
said
when
speaking
of
her
but
they
also
always
looked
a
little
when
she
appeared
and
never
were
sorry
when
she
left
them
she
was
a
tall
woman
with
a
pale
rigid
handsome
face
which
never
smiled
she
did
nothing
but
good
deeds
but
however
grateful
her
pensioners
might
be
nobody
would
ever
have
dared
to
dream
of
loving
her
she
was
just
and
cold
and
severe
she
wore
always
a
straight
black
serge
gown
broad
bands
of
white
linen
and
a
rosary
and
crucifix
at
her
waist
she
read
nothing
but
religious
works
and
legends
of
the
saints
and
martyrs
and
adjoining
her
private
apartments
was
a
little
stone
chapel
where
the
servants
said
she
used
to
kneel
on
the
cold
floor
before
the
altar
and
pray
for
hours
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
little
of
the
village
who
was
plump
and
comfortable
and
who
had
the
kindest
heart
and
the
most
cheerful
soul
in
the
world
used
to
remonstrate
with
her
always
in
a
roundabout
way
however
never
quite
as
if
he
were
referring
directly
to
herself
one
must
not
let
one
self
become
the
stone
image
of
goodness
he
said
once
since
one
is
really
of
flesh
and
blood
and
lives
among
flesh
and
blood
that
is
not
best
no
no
it
is
not
best
but
mademoiselle
de
rochemont
never
seemed
exactly
of
flesh
and
blood
she
was
more
like
a
marble
female
saint
who
had
descended
from
her
pedestal
to
walk
upon
the
earth
and
she
did
not
change
even
when
the
baby
elizabeth
was
brought
to
her
she
attended
strictly
to
the
child
comfort
and
prayed
many
prayers
for
her
innocent
soul
but
it
can
be
scarcely
said
that
her
manner
was
any
softer
or
that
she
smiled
more
at
first
elizabeth
used
to
scream
at
the
sight
of
the
black
dress
and
the
rigid
handsome
face
but
in
course
of
time
she
became
accustomed
to
them
and
through
living
in
an
atmosphere
so
silent
and
without
brightness
a
few
months
changed
her
from
a
laughing
romping
baby
into
a
pale
quiet
child
who
rarely
made
any
childish
noise
at
all
in
this
quiet
way
she
became
fond
of
her
aunt
she
saw
little
of
anyone
but
the
servants
who
were
all
trained
to
quietness
also
as
soon
as
she
was
old
enough
her
aunt
began
her
religious
training
before
she
could
speak
plainly
she
heard
legends
of
saints
and
stories
of
martyrs
she
was
taken
into
the
little
chapel
and
taught
to
pray
there
she
believed
in
miracles
and
would
not
have
been
surprised
at
any
moment
if
she
had
met
the
child
jesus
or
the
virgin
in
the
beautiful
rambling
gardens
which
surrounded
the
she
was
a
sensitive
imaginative
child
and
the
sacred
romances
she
heard
filled
all
her
mind
and
made
up
her
little
life
she
wished
to
be
a
saint
herself
and
spent
hours
in
wandering
in
the
terraced
rose
gardens
wondering
if
such
a
thing
was
possible
in
modern
days
and
what
she
must
do
to
obtain
such
holy
victory
her
chief
sorrow
was
that
she
knew
herself
to
be
delicate
and
very
timid
so
timid
that
she
often
suffered
when
people
did
not
suspect
it
and
she
was
afraid
that
she
was
not
brave
enough
to
be
a
martyr
once
poor
little
one
when
she
was
alone
in
her
room
she
held
her
hand
over
a
burning
wax
candle
but
the
pain
was
so
terrible
that
she
could
not
keep
it
there
indeed
she
fell
back
white
and
faint
and
sank
upon
her
chair
breathless
and
in
tears
because
she
felt
sure
that
she
could
not
chant
holy
songs
if
she
were
being
burned
at
the
stake
she
had
been
vowed
to
the
virgin
in
her
babyhood
and
was
always
dressed
in
white
and
blue
but
her
little
dress
was
a
small
conventual
robe
straight
and
narrow
cut
of
white
woollen
stuff
and
banded
plainly
with
blue
at
the
waist
she
did
not
look
like
other
children
but
she
was
very
sweet
and
gentle
and
her
pure
little
pale
face
and
large
dark
eyes
had
a
lovely
dreamy
look
when
she
was
old
enough
to
visit
the
poor
with
her
aunt
clotilde
and
she
was
hardly
seven
years
old
when
it
was
considered
proper
that
she
should
begin
the
villagers
did
not
stand
in
awe
of
her
they
began
to
adore
her
almost
to
worship
her
as
if
she
had
indeed
been
a
sacred
child
the
little
ones
delighted
to
look
at
her
to
draw
near
her
sometimes
and
touch
her
soft
white
and
blue
robe
and
when
they
did
so
she
always
returned
their
looks
with
such
a
tender
sympathetic
smile
and
spoke
to
them
in
so
gentle
a
voice
that
they
were
in
ecstasies
they
used
to
talk
her
over
tell
stories
about
her
when
they
were
playing
together
afterwards
the
little
mademoiselle
they
said
she
is
a
child
saint
i
have
heard
them
say
so
sometimes
there
is
a
little
light
round
her
head
one
day
her
little
white
robe
will
begin
to
shine
too
and
her
long
sleeves
will
be
wings
and
she
will
spread
them
and
ascend
through
the
blue
sky
to
paradise
you
will
see
if
it
is
not
so
so
in
this
secluded
world
in
the
gray
old
with
no
companion
but
her
aunt
with
no
occupation
but
her
studies
and
her
charities
with
no
thoughts
but
those
of
saints
and
religious
exercises
elizabeth
lived
until
she
was
eleven
years
old
then
a
great
grief
befell
her
one
morning
mademoiselle
de
rochemont
did
not
leave
her
room
at
the
regular
hour
as
she
never
broke
a
rule
she
had
made
for
herself
and
her
household
this
occasioned
great
wonder
her
old
maid
servant
waited
half
an
hour
went
to
her
door
and
took
the
liberty
of
listening
to
hear
if
she
was
up
and
moving
about
her
room
there
was
no
sound
old
alice
returned
looking
quite
agitated
would
mademoiselle
elizabeth
mind
entering
to
see
if
all
was
well
mademoiselle
her
aunt
might
be
in
the
chapel
elizabeth
went
her
aunt
was
not
in
her
room
then
she
must
be
in
the
chapel
the
child
entered
the
sacred
little
place
the
morning
sun
was
streaming
in
through
the
windows
above
the
altar
a
broad
ray
of
mingled
brilliant
colors
slanted
to
the
stone
floor
and
warmly
touched
a
dark
figure
lying
there
it
was
aunt
clotilde
who
had
sunk
forward
while
kneeling
at
prayer
and
had
died
in
the
night
that
was
what
the
doctors
said
when
they
were
sent
for
she
had
been
dead
some
hours
she
had
died
of
disease
of
the
heart
and
apparently
without
any
pain
or
knowledge
of
the
change
coming
to
her
her
face
was
serene
and
beautiful
and
the
rigid
look
had
melted
away
someone
said
she
looked
like
little
mademoiselle
elizabeth
and
her
old
servant
alice
wept
very
much
and
said
yes
yes
it
was
so
when
she
was
young
before
her
unhappiness
came
she
had
the
same
beautiful
little
face
but
she
was
more
gay
more
of
the
world
yes
they
were
much
alike
then
less
than
two
months
from
that
time
elizabeth
was
living
in
the
home
of
her
uncle
bertrand
in
new
york
he
had
come
to
normandy
for
her
himself
and
taken
her
back
with
him
across
the
atlantic
she
was
richer
than
ever
now
as
a
great
deal
of
her
aunt
clotilde
money
had
been
left
to
her
and
uncle
bertrand
was
her
guardian
he
was
a
handsome
elegant
clever
man
who
having
lived
long
in
america
and
being
fond
of
american
life
did
not
appear
very
much
like
a
frenchman
at
least
he
did
not
appear
so
to
elizabeth
who
had
only
seen
the
and
the
doctor
of
the
village
secretly
he
was
very
much
embarrassed
at
the
prospect
of
taking
care
of
a
little
girl
but
family
pride
and
the
fact
that
such
a
very
little
girl
who
was
also
such
a
very
great
heiress
be
taken
care
of
sustained
him
but
when
he
first
saw
elizabeth
he
could
not
restrain
an
exclamation
of
consternation
illustration
it
was
aunt
clotilde
who
had
sunk
forward
while
kneeling
at
prayer
she
entered
the
room
when
she
was
sent
for
clad
in
a
strange
little
robe
of
black
serge
made
as
like
aunt
as
possible
at
her
small
waist
were
the
rosary
and
crucifix
and
in
her
hand
she
held
a
missal
she
had
forgotten
in
her
agitation
to
lay
down
but
my
dear
child
exclaimed
uncle
bertrand
staring
at
her
aghast
he
managed
to
recover
himself
very
quickly
and
was
in
his
way
very
kind
to
her
but
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
send
to
paris
for
a
fashionable
maid
and
fashionable
mourning
because
as
you
will
see
he
remarked
to
alice
we
can
not
travel
as
we
are
it
is
a
costume
for
a
convent
or
the
stage
before
she
took
off
her
little
conventual
robe
elizabeth
went
to
the
village
to
visit
all
her
poor
the
went
with
her
and
shed
tears
himself
when
the
people
wept
and
kissed
her
little
hand
when
the
child
returned
she
went
into
the
chapel
and
remained
there
for
a
long
time
she
felt
as
if
she
was
living
in
a
dream
when
all
the
old
life
was
left
behind
and
she
found
herself
in
the
big
luxurious
house
in
the
gay
new
york
street
nothing
that
could
be
done
for
her
comfort
had
been
left
undone
she
had
several
beautiful
rooms
a
wonderful
governess
different
masters
to
teach
her
her
own
retinue
of
servants
as
indeed
has
been
already
said
but
secretly
she
felt
bewildered
and
almost
terrified
everything
was
so
new
so
strange
so
noisy
and
so
brilliant
the
dress
she
wore
made
her
feel
unlike
herself
the
books
they
gave
her
were
full
of
pictures
and
stories
of
worldly
things
of
which
she
knew
nothing
her
carriage
was
brought
to
the
door
and
she
went
out
with
her
governess
driving
round
and
round
the
park
with
scores
of
other
people
who
looked
at
her
curiously
she
did
not
know
why
the
truth
was
that
her
refined
little
face
was
very
beautiful
indeed
and
her
soft
dark
eyes
still
wore
the
dreamy
spiritual
look
which
made
her
unlike
the
rest
of
the
world
she
looks
like
a
little
princess
she
heard
her
uncle
say
one
day
she
will
be
some
day
a
beautiful
an
enchanting
woman
her
mother
was
so
when
she
died
at
twenty
but
she
had
been
brought
up
differently
this
one
is
a
little
devotee
i
am
afraid
of
her
her
governess
tells
me
she
rises
in
the
night
to
pray
he
said
it
with
light
laughter
to
some
of
his
gay
friends
by
whom
he
had
wished
the
child
to
be
seen
he
did
not
know
that
his
gayety
filled
her
with
fear
and
pain
she
had
been
taught
to
believe
gayety
worldly
and
sinful
and
his
whole
life
was
filled
with
it
he
had
brilliant
parties
he
did
not
go
to
church
he
had
no
pensioners
he
seemed
to
think
of
nothing
but
pleasure
poor
little
saint
elizabeth
prayed
for
his
soul
many
an
hour
when
he
was
asleep
after
a
grand
dinner
or
supper
party
he
could
not
possibly
have
dreamed
that
there
was
no
one
of
whom
she
stood
in
such
dread
her
timidity
increased
tenfold
in
his
presence
when
he
sent
for
her
and
she
went
into
the
library
to
find
him
luxurious
in
his
arm
chair
a
novel
on
his
knee
a
cigar
in
his
white
hand
a
tolerant
half
cynical
smile
on
his
handsome
mouth
she
could
scarcely
answer
his
questions
and
could
never
find
courage
to
tell
what
she
so
earnestly
desired
she
had
found
out
early
that
aunt
clotilde
and
the
and
the
life
they
had
led
had
only
aroused
in
his
mind
a
amusement
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
did
not
understand
and
had
strange
sacrilegious
thoughts
about
them
he
did
not
believe
in
miracles
he
smiled
when
she
spoke
of
saints
how
could
she
tell
him
that
she
wished
to
spend
all
her
money
in
building
churches
and
giving
alms
to
the
poor
that
was
what
she
wished
to
tell
him
that
she
wanted
money
to
send
back
to
the
village
that
she
wanted
to
give
it
to
the
poor
people
she
saw
in
the
streets
to
those
who
lived
in
the
miserable
places
but
when
she
found
herself
face
to
face
with
him
and
he
said
some
witty
thing
to
her
and
seemed
to
find
her
only
amusing
all
her
courage
failed
her
sometimes
she
thought
she
would
throw
herself
upon
her
knees
before
him
and
beg
him
to
send
her
back
to
normandy
to
let
her
live
alone
in
the
as
her
aunt
clotilde
had
done
one
morning
she
arose
very
early
and
knelt
a
long
time
before
the
little
altar
she
had
made
for
herself
in
her
dressing
room
it
was
only
a
table
with
some
black
velvet
thrown
over
it
a
crucifix
a
saintly
image
and
some
flowers
standing
upon
it
she
had
put
on
when
she
got
up
the
quaint
black
serge
robe
because
she
felt
more
at
home
in
it
and
her
heart
was
full
of
determination
the
night
before
she
had
received
a
letter
from
the
and
it
had
contained
sad
news
a
fever
had
broken
out
in
her
beloved
village
the
vines
had
done
badly
there
was
sickness
among
the
cattle
there
was
already
beginning
to
be
suffering
and
if
something
were
not
done
for
the
people
they
would
not
know
how
to
face
the
winter
in
the
time
of
mademoiselle
de
rochemont
they
had
always
been
made
comfortable
and
happy
at
christmas
what
was
to
be
done
the
ventured
to
write
to
mademoiselle
elizabeth
illustration
the
villagers
did
not
stand
in
awe
of
her
the
poor
child
had
scarcely
slept
at
all
her
dear
village
her
dear
people
the
children
would
be
hungry
the
cows
would
die
there
would
be
no
fires
to
warm
those
who
were
old
i
must
go
to
uncle
she
said
pale
and
trembling
i
must
ask
him
to
give
me
money
i
am
afraid
but
it
is
right
to
mortify
the
spirit
the
martyrs
went
to
the
stake
the
holy
saint
elizabeth
was
ready
to
endure
anything
that
she
might
do
her
duty
and
help
the
poor
because
she
had
been
called
elizabeth
she
had
thought
and
read
a
great
deal
of
the
saint
whose
namesake
she
was
the
saintly
elizabeth
whose
husband
was
so
wicked
and
cruel
and
who
wished
to
prevent
her
from
doing
good
deeds
and
oftenest
of
all
she
had
read
the
legend
which
told
that
one
day
as
elizabeth
went
out
with
a
basket
of
food
to
give
to
the
poor
and
hungry
she
had
met
her
savage
husband
who
had
demanded
that
she
should
tell
him
what
she
was
carrying
and
when
she
replied
roses
and
he
tore
the
cover
from
the
basket
to
see
if
she
spoke
the
truth
a
miracle
had
been
performed
and
the
basket
was
filled
with
roses
so
that
she
had
been
saved
from
her
husband
cruelty
and
also
from
telling
an
untruth
to
little
elizabeth
this
legend
had
been
beautiful
and
quite
real
it
proved
that
if
one
were
doing
good
the
saints
would
take
care
of
one
since
she
had
been
in
her
new
home
she
had
half
consciously
compared
her
uncle
bertrand
with
the
wicked
landgrave
though
she
was
too
gentle
and
just
to
think
he
was
really
cruel
as
saint
husband
had
been
only
he
did
not
care
for
the
poor
and
loved
only
the
world
and
surely
that
was
wicked
she
had
been
taught
that
to
care
for
the
world
at
all
was
a
fatal
sin
she
did
not
eat
any
breakfast
she
thought
she
would
fast
until
she
had
done
what
she
intended
to
do
it
had
been
her
aunt
clotilde
habit
to
fast
very
often
she
waited
anxiously
to
hear
that
her
uncle
bertrand
had
left
his
room
he
always
rose
late
and
this
morning
he
was
later
than
usual
as
he
had
had
a
long
gay
dinner
party
the
night
before
it
was
nearly
twelve
before
she
heard
his
door
open
then
she
went
quickly
to
the
staircase
her
heart
was
beating
so
fast
that
she
put
her
little
hand
to
her
side
and
waited
a
moment
to
regain
her
breath
she
felt
quite
cold
perhaps
i
must
wait
until
he
has
eaten
his
breakfast
she
said
perhaps
i
must
not
disturb
him
yet
it
would
make
him
displeased
i
will
wait
yes
for
a
little
while
she
did
not
return
to
her
room
but
waited
upon
the
stairs
it
seemed
to
be
a
long
time
it
appeared
that
a
friend
breakfasted
with
him
she
heard
a
gentleman
come
in
and
recognized
his
voice
which
she
had
heard
before
she
did
not
know
what
the
gentleman
name
was
but
she
had
met
him
going
in
and
out
with
her
uncle
once
or
twice
and
had
thought
he
had
a
kind
face
and
kind
eyes
he
had
looked
at
her
in
an
interested
way
when
he
spoke
to
her
even
as
if
he
were
a
little
curious
and
she
had
wondered
why
he
did
so
when
the
door
of
the
breakfast
room
opened
and
shut
as
the
servants
went
in
she
could
hear
the
two
laughing
and
talking
they
seemed
to
be
enjoying
themselves
very
much
once
she
heard
an
order
given
for
the
mail
phaeton
they
were
evidently
going
out
as
soon
as
the
meal
was
over
at
last
the
door
opened
and
they
were
coming
out
elizabeth
ran
down
the
stairs
and
stood
in
a
small
reception
room
her
heart
began
to
beat
faster
than
ever
the
blessed
martyrs
were
not
afraid
she
whispered
to
herself
uncle
bertrand
she
said
as
he
approached
and
she
scarcely
knew
her
own
faint
voice
uncle
bertrand
he
turned
and
seeing
her
started
and
exclaimed
rather
impatiently
evidently
he
was
at
once
amazed
and
displeased
to
see
her
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
out
and
the
sight
of
her
odd
little
figure
standing
in
its
straight
black
robe
between
the
the
slender
hands
clasped
on
the
breast
the
small
pale
face
and
great
dark
eyes
uplifted
was
certainly
a
surprise
to
him
elizabeth
he
said
what
do
you
wish
why
do
you
come
downstairs
and
that
impossible
dress
why
do
you
wear
it
again
it
is
not
suitable
uncle
bertrand
said
the
child
clasping
her
hands
still
more
tightly
her
eyes
growing
larger
in
her
excitement
and
terror
under
his
displeasure
it
is
that
i
want
money
a
great
deal
i
beg
your
pardon
if
i
derange
you
it
is
for
the
poor
moreover
the
has
written
the
people
of
the
village
are
ill
the
vineyards
did
not
yield
well
they
must
have
money
i
must
send
them
some
uncle
bertrand
shrugged
his
shoulders
that
is
the
message
of
le
is
it
he
said
he
wants
money
my
dear
elizabeth
i
must
inquire
further
you
have
a
fortune
but
i
can
not
permit
you
to
throw
it
away
you
are
a
child
and
do
not
understand
illustration
uncle
bertrand
said
the
child
clasping
her
hands
but
cried
elizabeth
trembling
with
agitation
they
are
so
poor
when
one
does
not
help
them
their
vineyards
are
so
little
and
if
the
year
is
bad
they
must
starve
aunt
clotilde
gave
to
them
every
year
even
in
the
good
years
she
said
they
must
be
cared
for
like
children
that
was
your
aunt
clotilde
charity
replied
her
uncle
sometimes
she
was
not
so
wise
as
she
was
devout
i
must
know
more
of
this
i
have
no
time
at
present
i
am
going
out
of
town
in
a
few
days
i
will
reflect
upon
it
tell
your
maid
to
give
that
hideous
garment
away
go
out
to
drive
amuse
yourself
you
are
too
pale
elizabeth
looked
at
his
handsome
careless
face
in
utter
helplessness
this
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
to
her
to
him
it
meant
nothing
but
it
is
winter
she
panted
breathlessly
there
is
snow
soon
it
will
be
christmas
and
they
will
have
nothing
no
candles
for
the
church
no
little
manger
for
the
holy
child
nothing
for
the
poorest
ones
and
the
children
it
shall
be
thought
of
later
said
uncle
bertrand
i
am
too
busy
now
be
reasonable
my
child
and
run
away
you
detain
me
he
left
her
with
a
slight
impatient
shrug
of
his
shoulders
and
the
slight
amused
smile
on
his
lips
she
heard
him
speak
to
his
friend
she
was
brought
up
by
one
who
had
renounced
the
world
he
said
and
she
has
already
renounced
it
herself
petite
at
eleven
years
she
wishes
to
devote
her
fortune
to
the
poor
and
herself
to
the
church
elizabeth
sank
back
into
the
shadow
of
the
great
burning
tears
filled
her
eyes
and
slipped
down
her
cheeks
falling
upon
her
breast
he
does
not
care
she
said
he
does
not
know
and
i
do
no
one
good
no
one
and
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
stood
sobbing
all
alone
when
she
returned
to
her
room
she
was
so
pale
that
her
maid
looked
at
her
anxiously
and
spoke
of
it
afterwards
to
the
other
servants
they
were
all
fond
of
mademoiselle
elizabeth
she
was
always
kind
and
gentle
to
everybody
nearly
all
the
day
she
sat
poor
little
saint
by
her
window
looking
out
at
the
in
the
snowy
street
but
she
scarcely
saw
the
people
at
all
her
thoughts
were
far
away
in
the
little
village
where
she
had
always
spent
her
christmas
before
her
aunt
clotilde
had
allowed
her
at
such
times
to
do
so
much
there
had
not
been
a
house
she
had
not
carried
some
gift
to
not
a
child
who
had
been
forgotten
and
the
church
on
christmas
morning
had
been
so
beautiful
with
flowers
from
the
of
the
it
was
for
the
church
indeed
that
the
conservatories
were
chiefly
kept
up
mademoiselle
de
rochemont
would
scarcely
have
permitted
herself
such
luxuries
but
there
would
not
be
flowers
this
year
the
was
closed
there
were
no
longer
gardeners
at
work
the
church
would
be
bare
and
cold
the
people
would
have
no
gifts
there
would
be
no
pleasure
in
the
little
peasants
faces
little
saint
elizabeth
wrung
her
slight
hands
together
in
her
lap
oh
she
cried
what
can
i
do
and
then
there
is
the
poor
here
so
many
and
i
do
nothing
the
saints
will
be
angry
they
will
not
intercede
for
me
i
shall
be
lost
it
was
not
alone
the
poor
she
had
left
in
her
village
who
were
a
grief
to
her
as
she
drove
through
the
streets
she
saw
now
and
then
haggard
faces
and
when
she
had
questioned
a
servant
who
had
one
day
come
to
her
to
ask
for
charity
for
a
poor
child
at
the
door
she
had
found
that
in
parts
of
this
great
bright
city
which
she
had
not
seen
there
was
said
to
be
cruel
want
and
suffering
as
in
all
great
cities
and
it
is
so
cold
now
she
thought
with
the
snow
on
the
ground
the
lamps
in
the
street
were
just
beginning
to
be
lighted
when
her
uncle
bertrand
returned
it
appeared
that
he
had
brought
back
with
him
the
gentleman
with
the
kind
face
they
were
to
dine
together
and
uncle
bertrand
desired
that
mademoiselle
elizabeth
should
join
them
evidently
the
journey
out
of
town
had
been
delayed
for
a
day
at
least
there
came
also
another
message
monsieur
de
rochemont
wished
mademoiselle
to
send
to
him
by
her
maid
a
certain
box
of
antique
ornaments
which
had
been
given
to
her
by
her
aunt
clotilde
elizabeth
had
known
less
of
the
value
of
these
jewels
than
of
their
beauty
she
knew
they
were
beautiful
and
that
they
had
belonged
to
her
aunt
clotilde
in
the
gay
days
of
her
triumphs
as
a
beauty
and
a
brilliant
and
adored
young
woman
but
it
seemed
that
they
were
also
very
curious
and
monsieur
de
rochemont
wished
his
friend
to
see
them
when
elizabeth
went
downstairs
she
found
them
examining
them
together
they
must
be
put
somewhere
for
safe
keeping
uncle
bertrand
was
saying
it
should
have
been
done
before
i
will
attend
to
it
the
gentleman
with
the
kind
eyes
looked
at
elizabeth
with
an
interested
expression
as
she
came
into
the
room
her
slender
little
figure
in
its
black
velvet
dress
her
delicate
little
face
with
its
large
soft
sad
eyes
the
gentle
gravity
of
her
manner
made
her
seem
quite
unlike
other
children
he
did
not
seem
simply
to
find
her
amusing
as
her
uncle
bertrand
did
she
was
always
conscious
that
behind
uncle
bertrand
most
serious
expression
there
was
lurking
a
faint
smile
as
he
watched
her
but
this
visitor
looked
at
her
in
a
different
way
he
was
a
doctor
she
discovered
norris
her
uncle
called
him
and
elizabeth
wondered
if
perhaps
his
profession
had
not
made
him
quick
of
sight
and
kind
she
felt
that
it
must
be
so
when
she
heard
him
talk
at
dinner
she
found
that
he
did
a
great
deal
of
work
among
the
very
poor
he
had
a
hospital
where
he
received
little
children
who
were
ill
who
had
perhaps
met
with
accidents
and
could
not
be
taken
care
of
in
their
wretched
homes
he
spoke
most
frequently
of
terrible
quarters
which
he
called
five
points
the
greatest
poverty
and
suffering
was
there
and
he
spoke
of
it
with
such
eloquent
sympathy
that
even
uncle
bertrand
began
to
listen
with
interest
come
he
said
you
are
a
rich
idle
fellow
de
rochemont
and
we
want
rich
idle
fellows
to
come
and
look
into
all
this
and
do
something
for
us
you
must
let
me
take
you
with
me
some
day
it
would
disturb
me
too
much
my
good
norris
said
uncle
bertrand
with
a
slight
shudder
i
should
not
enjoy
my
dinner
after
it
then
go
without
your
dinner
said
norris
these
people
do
you
have
too
many
dinners
give
up
one
uncle
bertrand
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
smiled
it
is
elizabeth
who
fasts
he
said
myself
i
prefer
to
dine
and
yet
some
day
i
may
have
the
fancy
to
visit
this
place
with
you
elizabeth
could
scarcely
have
been
said
to
dine
this
evening
she
could
not
eat
she
sat
with
her
large
sad
eyes
fixed
upon
norris
face
as
he
talked
every
word
he
uttered
sank
deep
into
her
heart
the
want
and
suffering
of
which
he
spoke
were
more
terrible
than
anything
she
had
ever
heard
of
it
had
been
nothing
like
this
in
the
village
oh
no
no
as
she
thought
of
it
there
was
such
a
look
in
her
dark
eyes
as
almost
startled
norris
several
times
when
he
glanced
at
her
but
as
he
did
not
know
the
particulars
of
her
life
with
her
aunt
and
the
strange
training
she
had
had
he
could
not
possibly
have
guessed
what
was
going
on
in
her
mind
and
how
much
effect
his
stories
were
having
the
beautiful
little
face
touched
him
very
much
and
the
pretty
french
accent
with
which
the
child
spoke
seemed
very
musical
to
him
and
added
a
great
charm
to
the
gentle
serious
answers
she
made
to
the
remarks
he
addressed
to
her
he
could
not
help
seeing
that
something
had
made
little
mademoiselle
elizabeth
a
pathetic
and
singular
little
creature
and
he
continually
wondered
what
it
was
do
you
think
she
is
a
happy
child
he
asked
monsieur
de
rochemont
when
they
were
alone
together
over
their
cigars
and
wine
happy
said
uncle
bertrand
with
his
light
smile
she
has
been
taught
my
friend
that
to
be
happy
upon
earth
is
a
crime
that
was
my
good
sister
creed
one
must
devote
one
self
not
to
happiness
but
entirely
to
good
works
i
think
i
have
told
you
that
she
this
little
one
desires
to
give
all
her
fortune
to
the
poor
having
heard
you
this
evening
she
will
wish
to
bestow
it
upon
your
five
points
when
having
retired
from
the
room
with
a
grave
and
stately
little
obeisance
to
her
uncle
and
his
guest
elizabeth
had
gone
upstairs
it
had
not
been
with
the
intention
of
going
to
bed
she
sent
her
maid
away
and
knelt
before
her
altar
for
a
long
time
the
saints
will
tell
me
what
to
do
she
said
the
good
saints
who
are
always
gracious
they
will
vouchsafe
to
me
some
thought
which
will
instruct
me
if
i
remain
long
enough
at
prayer
she
remained
in
prayer
a
long
time
when
at
last
she
arose
from
her
knees
it
was
long
past
midnight
and
she
was
tired
and
weak
but
the
thought
had
not
been
given
to
her
but
just
as
she
laid
her
head
upon
her
pillow
it
came
the
ornaments
given
to
her
by
her
aunt
clotilde
somebody
would
buy
them
they
were
her
own
it
would
be
right
to
sell
them
to
what
better
use
could
they
be
put
was
it
not
what
aunt
clotilde
would
have
desired
had
she
not
told
her
stories
of
the
good
and
charitable
who
had
sold
the
clothes
from
their
bodies
that
the
miserable
might
be
helped
yes
it
was
right
these
things
must
be
done
all
else
was
vain
and
useless
and
of
the
world
but
it
would
require
courage
great
courage
to
go
out
alone
to
find
a
place
where
the
people
would
buy
the
jewels
perhaps
there
might
be
some
who
would
not
want
them
and
then
when
they
were
sold
to
find
this
poor
and
unhappy
quarter
of
which
her
uncle
guest
had
spoken
and
to
give
to
those
who
needed
all
by
herself
ah
what
courage
it
would
require
and
then
uncle
bertrand
some
day
he
would
ask
about
the
ornaments
and
discover
all
and
his
anger
might
be
terrible
no
one
had
ever
been
angry
with
her
how
could
she
bear
it
but
had
not
the
saints
and
martyrs
borne
everything
had
they
not
gone
to
the
stake
and
the
rack
with
smiles
she
thought
of
saint
elizabeth
and
the
cruel
landgrave
it
could
not
be
even
so
bad
as
that
but
whatever
the
result
was
it
must
be
borne
so
at
last
she
slept
and
there
was
upon
her
gentle
little
face
so
sweetly
sad
a
look
that
when
her
maid
came
to
waken
her
in
the
morning
she
stood
by
the
bedside
for
some
moments
looking
down
upon
her
pityingly
the
day
seemed
very
long
and
sorrowful
to
the
poor
child
it
was
full
of
anxious
thoughts
and
plannings
she
was
so
innocent
and
inexperienced
so
ignorant
of
all
practical
things
she
had
decided
that
it
would
be
best
to
wait
until
evening
before
going
out
and
then
to
take
the
jewels
and
try
to
sell
them
to
some
jeweller
she
did
not
understand
the
difficulties
that
would
lie
in
her
way
but
she
felt
very
timid
her
maid
had
asked
permission
to
go
out
for
the
evening
and
monsieur
de
rochemont
was
to
dine
out
so
that
she
found
it
possible
to
leave
the
house
without
attracting
attention
as
soon
as
the
streets
were
lighted
she
took
the
case
of
ornaments
and
going
downstairs
very
quietly
let
herself
out
the
servants
were
dining
and
she
was
seen
by
none
of
them
when
she
found
herself
in
the
snowy
street
she
felt
strangely
bewildered
she
had
never
been
out
unattended
before
and
she
knew
nothing
of
the
great
busy
city
when
she
turned
into
the
more
crowded
thoroughfares
she
saw
several
times
that
the
glanced
at
her
curiously
her
timid
look
her
foreign
air
and
richly
furred
dress
and
the
fact
that
she
was
a
child
and
alone
at
such
an
hour
could
not
fail
to
attract
attention
but
though
she
felt
confused
and
troubled
she
went
bravely
on
it
was
some
time
before
she
found
a
jeweller
shop
and
when
she
entered
it
the
men
behind
the
counter
looked
at
her
in
amazement
but
she
went
to
the
one
nearest
to
her
and
laid
the
case
of
jewels
on
the
counter
before
him
i
wish
she
said
in
her
soft
low
voice
and
with
the
pretty
accent
i
wish
that
you
should
buy
these
the
man
stared
at
her
and
at
the
ornaments
and
then
at
her
again
i
beg
pardon
miss
he
said
elizabeth
repeated
her
request
i
will
speak
to
moetyler
he
said
after
a
moment
of
hesitation
he
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
shop
to
an
elderly
man
who
sat
behind
a
desk
after
he
had
spoken
a
few
words
the
elderly
man
looked
up
as
if
surprised
then
he
glanced
at
elizabeth
then
after
speaking
a
few
more
words
he
came
forward
you
wish
to
sell
these
he
said
looking
at
the
case
of
jewels
with
a
puzzled
expression
yes
elizabeth
answered
he
bent
over
the
case
and
took
up
one
ornament
after
the
other
and
examined
them
closely
after
he
had
done
this
he
looked
at
the
little
girl
innocent
trustful
face
seeming
more
puzzled
than
before
are
they
your
own
he
inquired
yes
they
are
mine
she
replied
timidly
do
you
know
how
much
they
are
worth
i
know
that
they
are
worth
much
money
said
elizabeth
i
have
heard
it
said
so
do
your
friends
know
that
you
are
going
to
sell
them
no
elizabeth
said
a
faint
color
rising
in
her
delicate
face
but
it
is
right
that
i
should
do
it
the
man
spent
a
few
moments
in
examining
them
again
and
having
done
so
spoke
hesitatingly
i
am
afraid
we
can
not
buy
them
he
said
it
would
be
impossible
unless
your
friends
first
gave
their
permission
impossible
said
elizabeth
and
tears
rose
in
her
eyes
making
them
look
softer
and
more
wistful
than
ever
we
could
not
do
it
said
the
jeweller
it
is
out
of
the
question
under
the
circumstances
do
you
think
faltered
the
poor
little
saint
do
you
think
that
nobody
will
buy
them
i
am
afraid
not
was
the
reply
no
respectable
firm
who
would
pay
their
real
value
if
you
take
my
advice
young
lady
you
will
take
them
home
and
consult
your
friends
he
spoke
kindly
but
elizabeth
was
overwhelmed
with
disappointment
she
did
not
know
enough
of
the
world
to
understand
that
a
richly
dressed
little
girl
who
offered
valuable
jewels
for
sale
at
night
must
be
a
strange
and
unusual
sight
when
she
found
herself
on
the
street
again
her
long
lashes
were
heavy
with
tears
if
no
one
will
buy
them
she
said
what
shall
i
do
she
walked
a
long
way
so
long
that
she
was
very
tired
and
offered
them
at
several
places
but
as
she
chanced
to
enter
only
respectable
shops
the
same
thing
happened
each
time
she
was
looked
at
curiously
and
questioned
but
no
one
would
buy
they
are
mine
she
would
say
it
is
right
that
i
should
sell
them
but
everyone
stared
and
seemed
puzzled
and
in
the
end
refused
at
last
after
much
wandering
she
found
herself
in
a
poorer
quarter
of
the
city
the
streets
were
narrower
and
dirtier
and
the
people
began
to
look
squalid
and
wretchedly
dressed
there
were
smaller
shops
and
dingy
houses
she
saw
unkempt
men
and
women
and
uncared
for
little
children
the
poverty
of
the
poor
she
had
seen
in
her
own
village
seemed
comfort
and
luxury
by
contrast
she
had
never
dreamed
of
anything
like
this
now
and
then
she
felt
faint
with
pain
and
horror
but
she
went
on
they
have
no
vineyards
she
said
to
herself
no
trees
and
flowers
it
is
all
dreadful
there
is
nothing
they
need
help
more
than
the
others
to
let
them
suffer
so
and
not
to
give
them
charity
would
be
a
great
crime
she
was
so
full
of
grief
and
excitement
that
she
had
ceased
to
notice
how
everyone
looked
at
her
she
saw
only
the
wretchedness
and
dirt
and
misery
she
did
not
know
poor
child
that
she
was
surrounded
by
danger
that
she
was
not
only
in
the
midst
of
misery
but
of
dishonesty
and
crime
she
had
even
forgotten
her
timidity
that
it
was
growing
late
and
that
she
was
far
from
home
and
would
not
know
how
to
return
she
did
not
realize
that
she
had
walked
so
far
that
she
was
almost
exhausted
with
fatigue
she
had
brought
with
her
all
the
money
she
possessed
if
she
could
not
sell
the
jewels
she
could
at
least
give
something
to
someone
in
want
but
she
did
not
know
to
whom
she
must
give
first
when
she
had
lived
with
her
aunt
clotilde
it
had
been
their
habit
to
visit
the
peasants
in
their
houses
must
she
enter
one
of
these
houses
these
dreadful
places
with
the
dark
passages
from
which
she
heard
many
times
riotous
voices
and
even
cries
issuing
but
those
who
do
good
must
feel
no
fear
she
thought
it
is
only
to
have
courage
at
length
something
happened
which
caused
her
to
pause
before
one
of
those
places
she
heard
sounds
of
pitiful
moans
and
sobbing
from
something
crouched
upon
the
broken
steps
it
seemed
like
a
heap
of
rags
but
as
she
drew
near
she
saw
by
the
light
of
the
street
lamp
opposite
that
it
was
a
woman
with
her
head
in
her
knees
and
a
wretched
child
on
each
side
of
her
the
children
were
shivering
with
cold
and
making
low
cries
as
if
they
were
frightened
elizabeth
stopped
and
then
ascended
the
steps
why
is
it
that
you
cry
she
asked
gently
tell
me
the
woman
did
not
answer
at
first
but
when
elizabeth
spoke
again
she
lifted
her
head
and
as
soon
as
she
saw
the
slender
figure
in
its
velvet
and
furs
and
the
pale
refined
little
face
she
gave
a
great
start
lord
have
mercy
on
yez
she
said
in
a
hoarse
voice
which
sounded
almost
terrified
who
are
yez
an
what
bees

dow
in
a
place
the
loike
o
this
i
came
said
elizabeth
to
see
those
who
are
poor
i
wish
to
help
them
i
have
great
sorrow
for
them
it
is
right
that
the
rich
should
help
those
who
want
tell
me
why
you
cry
and
why
your
little
children
sit
in
the
cold
everybody
had
shown
surprise
to
whom
elizabeth
had
spoken
but
no
one
had
stared
as
this
woman
did
it
no
place
for
the
loike
o

she
said
an
it
black
noight

and
women

an

and
she
dropped
her
wretched
head
on
her
knees
and
began
to
moan
again
and
the
children
joined
her
illustration
why
is
it
that
you
cry
she
asked
gently
do
let

daddy

she
said
to
them
whisht

an
kill

elizabeth
began
to
feel
tremulous
and
faint
is
it
that
they
have
hunger
she
asked
not
a
bite
or
sup
have
they
had
this
day
nor
yesterday
was
the
answer
the
good
saints
have
pity
on
us
yes
said
elizabeth
the
good
saints
have
always
pity
i
will
go
and
get
some
food
poor
little
ones
she
had
seen
a
shop
only
a
few
yards
away
she
remembered
passing
it
before
the
woman
could
speak
again
she
was
gone
yes
she
said
i
was
sent
to
them
it
is
the
answer
to
my
prayer
it
was
not
in
vain
that
i
asked
so
long
when
she
entered
the
shop
the
few
people
who
were
in
it
stopped
what
they
were
doing
to
stare
at
her
as
others
had
done
but
she
scarcely
saw
that
it
was
so
give
to
me
a
basket
she
said
to
the
owner
of
the
place
put
in
it
some
bread
and
wine
some
of
the
things
which
are
ready
to
eat
it
is
for
a
poor
woman
and
her
little
ones
who
starve
there
was
in
the
shop
among
others
a
woman
with
a
cunning
look
in
her
eyes
she
sidled
out
of
the
place
and
was
waiting
for
elizabeth
when
she
came
out
i
starvin
too
little
lady
she
said
there
many
of
us
that
way
an
it
not
often
them
with
money
care
about
it
give
me
something
too
in
a
wheedling
voice
elizabeth
looked
up
at
her
her
pure
ignorant
eyes
full
of
pity
i
have
great
sorrows
for
you
she
said
perhaps
the
poor
woman
will
share
her
food
with
you
it
the
money
i
need
said
the
woman
i
have
none
left
answered
elizabeth
i
will
come
again
it
now
i
want
it
the
woman
persisted
then
she
looked
covetously
at
elizabeth
velvet
and
trimmed
cloak
that
a
pretty
cloak
you
on
she
said
you
got
another
i
daresay
suddenly
she
gave
the
cloak
a
pull
but
the
fastening
did
not
give
way
as
she
had
thought
it
would
is
it
because
you
are
cold
that
you
want
it
said
elizabeth
in
her
gentle
innocent
way
i
will
give
it
to
you
take
it
had
not
the
holy
ones
in
the
legends
given
their
garments
to
the
poor
why
should
she
not
give
her
cloak
in
an
instant
it
was
unclasped
and
snatched
away
and
the
woman
was
gone
she
did
not
even
stay
long
enough
to
give
thanks
for
the
gift
and
something
in
her
haste
and
roughness
made
elizabeth
wonder
and
gave
her
a
moment
of
tremor
she
made
her
way
back
to
the
place
where
the
other
woman
and
her
children
had
been
sitting
the
cold
wind
made
her
shiver
and
the
basket
was
very
heavy
for
her
slender
arm
her
strength
seemed
to
be
giving
way
as
she
turned
the
corner
a
great
fierce
gust
of
wind
swept
round
it
and
caught
her
breath
and
made
her
stagger
she
thought
she
was
going
to
fall
indeed
she
would
have
fallen
but
that
one
of
the
tall
men
who
were
passing
put
out
his
arm
and
caught
her
he
was
a
well
dressed
man
in
a
heavy
overcoat
he
had
gloves
on
elizabeth
spoke
in
a
faint
tone
i
thank
you
she
began
when
the
second
man
uttered
a
wild
exclamation
and
sprang
forward
elizabeth
he
said
elizabeth
elizabeth
looked
up
and
uttered
a
cry
herself
it
was
her
uncle
bertrand
who
stood
before
her
and
his
companion
who
had
saved
her
from
falling
was
norris
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
almost
struck
dumb
with
horror
and
then
her
uncle
bertrand
seized
her
by
the
arm
in
such
agitation
that
he
scarcely
seemed
himself
not
the
light
satirical
jesting
uncle
bertrand
she
had
known
at
all
what
does
it
mean
he
cried
what
are
you
doing
here
in
this
horrible
place
alone
do
you
know
where
it
is
you
have
come
what
have
you
in
your
basket
explain
explain
the
moment
of
trial
had
come
and
it
seemed
even
more
terrible
than
the
poor
child
had
imagined
the
long
strain
and
exertion
had
been
too
much
for
her
delicate
body
she
felt
that
she
could
bear
no
more
the
cold
seemed
to
have
struck
to
her
very
heart
she
looked
up
at
monsieur
de
rochemont
pale
excited
face
and
trembled
from
head
to
foot
a
strange
thought
flashed
into
her
mind
saint
elizabeth
of
thuringia
the
cruel
landgrave
perhaps
the
saints
would
help
her
too
since
she
was
trying
to
do
their
bidding
surely
surely
it
must
be
so
speak
repeated
monsieur
de
rochemont
why
is
this
the
basket
what
have
you
in
it
roses
said
elizabeth
roses
and
then
her
strength
deserted
her
she
fell
upon
her
knees
in
the
snow
the
basket
slipped
from
her
arm
and
the
first
thing
which
fell
from
it
was
no
not
roses
there
had
been
no
miracle
wrought
not
roses
but
the
case
of
jewels
which
she
had
laid
on
the
top
of
the
other
things
that
it
might
be
the
more
easily
carried
illustration
her
strength
deserted
her
she
fell
upon
her
knees
in
the
snow
roses
cried
uncle
bertrand
is
it
that
the
child
is
mad
they
are
the
jewels
of
my
sister
clotilde
elizabeth
clasped
her
hands
and
leaned
towards
norris
the
tears
streaming
from
her
uplifted
eyes
ah
monsieur
she
sobbed
you
will
understand
it
was
for
the
poor
they
suffer
so
much
if
we
do
not
help
them
our
souls
will
be
lost
i
did
not
mean
to
speak
falsely
i
thought
the
saints
the
saints
but
her
sobs
filled
her
throat
and
she
could
not
finish
norris
stopped
and
took
her
in
his
strong
arms
as
if
she
had
been
a
baby
quick
he
said
imperatively
we
must
return
to
the
carriage
de
rochemont
this
is
a
serious
matter
elizabeth
clung
to
him
with
trembling
hands
but
the
poor
woman
who
starves
she
cried
the
little
children
they
sit
up
on
the
step
quite
near
the
food
was
for
them
i
pray
you
give
it
to
them
yes
they
shall
have
it
said
the
doctor
take
the
basket
de
rochemont
only
a
few
doors
below
and
it
appeared
that
there
was
something
in
his
voice
which
seemed
to
render
obedience
necessary
for
monsieur
de
rochemont
actually
did
as
he
was
told
for
a
moment
norris
put
elizabeth
on
her
feet
again
but
it
was
only
while
he
removed
his
overcoat
and
wrapped
it
about
her
slight
shivering
body
you
are
chilled
through
poor
child
he
said
and
you
are
not
strong
enough
to
walk
just
now
you
must
let
me
carry
you
it
was
true
that
a
sudden
faintness
had
come
upon
her
and
she
could
not
restrain
the
shudder
which
shook
her
it
still
shook
her
when
she
was
placed
in
the
carriage
which
the
two
gentlemen
had
thought
it
wiser
to
leave
in
one
of
the
more
respectable
streets
when
they
went
to
explore
the
worse
ones
together
what
might
not
have
occurred
if
we
had
not
arrived
at
that
instant
said
uncle
bertrand
when
he
got
into
the
carriage
as
it
is
who
knows
what
illness
it
will
be
better
to
say
as
little
as
possible
now
said
norris
it
was
for
the
poor
said
elizabeth
trembling
i
had
prayed
to
the
saints
to
tell
me
what
was
best
i
thought
i
must
go
i
did
not
mean
to
do
wrong
it
was
for
the
poor
and
while
her
uncle
bertrand
regarded
her
with
a
strangely
agitated
look
and
norris
held
her
hand
between
his
strong
and
warm
ones
the
tears
rolled
down
her
pure
pale
little
face
she
did
not
know
until
some
time
after
what
danger
she
had
been
in
that
the
part
of
the
city
into
which
she
had
wandered
was
the
lowest
and
worst
and
was
in
some
quarters
the
home
of
thieves
and
criminals
of
every
class
as
her
uncle
bertrand
had
said
it
was
impossible
to
say
what
terrible
thing
might
have
happened
if
they
had
not
met
her
so
soon
it
was
norris
who
explained
it
all
to
her
as
gently
and
kindly
as
was
possible
she
had
always
been
fragile
and
she
had
caught
a
severe
cold
which
caused
her
an
illness
of
some
weeks
it
was
norris
who
took
care
of
her
and
it
was
not
long
before
her
timidity
was
forgotten
in
her
tender
and
trusting
affection
for
him
she
learned
to
watch
for
his
coming
and
to
feel
that
she
was
no
longer
lonely
it
was
through
him
that
her
uncle
permitted
her
to
send
to
the
a
sum
of
money
large
enough
to
do
all
that
was
necessary
it
was
through
him
that
the
poor
woman
and
her
children
were
clothed
and
fed
and
protected
when
she
was
well
enough
he
had
promised
that
she
should
help
him
among
his
own
poor
and
through
him
though
she
lost
none
of
her
sweet
sympathy
for
those
who
suffered
she
learned
to
live
a
more
natural
and
life
and
to
find
that
there
were
innocent
natural
pleasures
to
be
enjoyed
in
the
world
in
time
she
even
ceased
to
be
afraid
of
her
uncle
bertrand
and
to
be
quite
happy
in
the
great
beautiful
house
and
as
for
uncle
bertrand
himself
he
became
very
fond
of
her
and
sometimes
even
helped
her
to
dispense
her
charities
he
had
a
light
gay
nature
but
he
was
kind
at
heart
and
always
disliked
to
see
or
think
of
suffering
now
and
then
he
would
give
more
lavishly
than
wisely
and
then
he
would
say
with
his
habitual
graceful
shrug
of
the
shoulders
yes
it
appears
i
am
not
discreet
finally
i
think
i
must
leave
my
charities
to
you
my
good
norris
to
you
and
little
saint
elizabeth
the
story
of
prince
fairyfoot
prefatory
note
the
story
of
prince
fairyfoot
was
originally
intended
to
be
the
first
of
a
series
under
the
general
title
of
stories
from
the
lost
by
the
child
who
read
them
concerning
which
burnett
relates
when
i
was
a
child
of
six
or
seven
i
had
given
to
me
a
book
of
of
which
i
was
very
fond
before
it
had
been
in
my
possession
many
months
it
disappeared
and
though
since
then
i
have
tried
repeatedly
both
in
england
and
america
to
find
a
copy
of
it
i
have
never
been
able
to
do
so
i
asked
a
friend
in
the
congressional
library
at
washington
a
man
whose
knowledge
of
books
is
almost
unlimited
to
try
to
learn
something
about
it
for
me
but
even
he
could
find
no
trace
of
it
and
so
we
concluded
it
must
have
been
out
of
print
some
time
i
always
remembered
the
impression
the
stories
had
made
on
me
and
though
most
of
them
had
become
very
faint
recollections
i
frequently
told
them
to
children
with
additions
of
my
own
the
story
of
fairyfoot
i
had
promised
to
tell
a
little
girl
and
in
accordance
with
the
promise
i
developed
the
outline
i
remembered
introduced
new
characters
and
conversation
wrote
it
upon
note
paper
inclosed
it
in
a
decorated
satin
cover
and
sent
it
to
her
in
the
first
place
it
was
merely
for
her
with
no
intention
of
publication
but
she
was
so
delighted
with
it
and
read
and
reread
it
so
untiringly
that
it
occurred
to
me
other
children
might
like
to
hear
it
also
so
i
made
the
plan
of
developing
and
the
other
stories
in
like
manner
and
having
them
published
under
the
title
of
from
the
lost
by
the
child
who
read
them
the
little
volume
in
question
burnett
afterwards
discovered
to
be
entitled
granny
wonderful
chair
and
the
tales
it
told
the
story
of
prince
fairyfoot
part
i
once
upon
a
time
in
the
days
of
the
fairies
there
was
in
the
far
west
country
a
kingdom
which
was
called
by
the
name
of
stumpinghame
it
was
a
rather
curious
country
in
several
ways
in
the
first
place
the
people
who
lived
there
thought
that
stumpinghame
was
all
the
world
they
thought
there
was
no
world
at
all
outside
stumpinghame
and
they
thought
that
the
people
of
stumpinghame
knew
everything
that
could
possibly
be
known
and
that
what
they
did
not
know
was
of
no
consequence
at
all
one
idea
common
in
stumpinghame
was
really
very
unusual
indeed
it
was
a
peculiar
taste
in
the
matter
of
feet
in
stumpinghame
the
larger
a
person
feet
were
the
more
beautiful
and
elegant
he
or
she
was
considered
and
the
more
aristocratic
and
nobly
born
a
man
was
the
more
immense
were
his
feet
only
the
very
lowest
and
most
vulgar
persons
were
ever
known
to
have
small
feet
the
king
feet
were
simply
huge
so
were
the
queen
so
were
those
of
the
young
princes
and
princesses
it
had
never
occurred
to
anyone
that
a
member
of
such
a
royal
family
could
possibly
disgrace
himself
by
being
born
with
small
feet
well
you
may
imagine
then
what
a
terrible
and
humiliating
state
of
affairs
arose
when
there
was
born
into
that
royal
family
a
little
son
a
prince
whose
feet
were
so
very
small
and
slender
and
delicate
that
they
would
have
been
considered
small
even
in
other
places
than
stumpinghame
grief
and
confusion
seized
the
entire
nation
the
queen
fainted
six
times
a
day
the
king
had
black
rosettes
fastened
upon
his
crown
all
the
flags
were
at
and
the
court
went
into
the
deepest
mourning
there
had
been
born
to
stumpinghame
a
royal
prince
with
small
feet
and
nobody
knew
how
the
country
could
survive
it
yet
the
disgraceful
little
prince
survived
it
and
did
not
seem
to
mind
at
all
he
was
the
prettiest
and
best
tempered
baby
the
royal
nurse
had
ever
seen
but
for
his
small
feet
he
would
have
been
the
flower
of
the
family
the
royal
nurse
said
to
herself
and
privately
told
his
little
royal
highness
chief
that
she
never
see
a
infant
as
took
notice
so
and
sneezed
as
intelligent
but
of
course
the
king
and
queen
could
see
nothing
but
his
little
feet
and
very
soon
they
made
up
their
minds
to
send
him
away
so
one
day
they
had
him
bundled
up
and
carried
where
they
thought
he
might
be
quite
forgotten
they
sent
him
to
the
hut
of
a
swineherd
who
lived
deep
deep
in
a
great
forest
which
seemed
to
end
nowhere
they
gave
the
swineherd
some
money
and
some
clothes
for
fairyfoot
and
told
him
that
if
he
would
take
care
of
the
child
they
would
send
money
and
clothes
every
year
as
for
themselves
they
only
wished
to
be
sure
of
never
seeing
fairyfoot
again
this
pleased
the
swineherd
well
enough
he
was
poor
and
he
had
a
wife
and
ten
children
and
hundreds
of
swine
to
take
care
of
and
he
knew
he
could
use
the
little
prince
money
and
clothes
for
his
own
family
and
no
one
would
find
it
out
so
he
let
his
wife
take
the
little
fellow
and
as
soon
as
the
king
messengers
had
gone
the
woman
took
the
royal
clothes
off
the
prince
and
put
on
him
a
coarse
little
nightgown
and
gave
all
his
things
to
her
own
children
but
the
baby
prince
did
not
seem
to
mind
that
he
did
not
seem
to
mind
anything
even
though
he
had
no
name
but
prince
fairyfoot
which
had
been
given
him
in
contempt
by
the
disgusted
courtiers
he
grew
prettier
and
prettier
every
day
and
long
before
the
time
when
other
children
begin
to
walk
he
could
run
about
on
his
fairy
feet
the
swineherd
and
his
wife
did
not
like
him
at
all
in
fact
they
disliked
him
because
he
was
so
much
prettier
and
so
much
brighter
than
their
own
clumsy
children
and
the
children
did
not
like
him
because
they
were
ill
natured
and
only
liked
themselves
so
as
he
grew
older
year
by
year
the
poor
little
prince
was
more
and
more
lonely
he
had
no
one
to
play
with
and
was
obliged
to
be
always
by
himself
he
dressed
only
in
the
coarsest
and
roughest
clothes
he
seldom
had
enough
to
eat
and
he
slept
on
straw
in
a
loft
under
the
roof
of
the
swineherd
hut
but
all
this
did
not
prevent
his
being
strong
and
rosy
and
active
he
was
as
fleet
as
the
wind
and
he
had
a
voice
as
sweet
as
a
bird
he
had
lovely
sparkling
eyes
and
bright
golden
hair
and
he
had
so
kind
a
heart
that
he
would
not
have
done
a
wrong
or
cruel
thing
for
the
world
as
soon
as
he
was
big
enough
the
swineherd
made
him
go
out
into
the
forest
every
day
to
take
care
of
the
swine
he
was
obliged
to
keep
them
together
in
one
place
and
if
any
of
them
ran
away
into
the
forest
prince
fairyfoot
was
beaten
and
as
the
swine
were
very
wild
and
unruly
he
was
very
often
beaten
because
it
was
almost
impossible
to
keep
them
from
wandering
off
and
when
they
ran
away
they
ran
so
fast
and
through
places
so
tangled
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
follow
them
the
forest
in
which
he
had
to
spend
the
long
days
was
a
very
beautiful
one
however
and
he
could
take
pleasure
in
that
it
was
a
forest
so
great
that
it
was
like
a
world
in
itself
there
were
in
it
strange
splendid
trees
the
branches
of
which
interlocked
overhead
and
when
their
many
leaves
moved
and
rustled
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
whispering
secrets
there
were
bright
swift
strange
birds
that
flew
about
in
the
deep
golden
sunshine
and
when
they
rested
on
the
boughs
they
too
seemed
telling
one
another
secrets
there
was
a
bright
clear
brook
with
water
as
sparkling
and
pure
as
crystal
and
with
shining
shells
and
pebbles
of
all
colours
lying
in
the
gold
and
silver
sand
at
the
bottom
prince
fairyfoot
always
thought
the
brook
knew
the
forest
secret
also
and
sang
it
softly
to
the
flowers
as
it
ran
along
and
as
for
the
flowers
they
were
beautiful
they
grew
as
thickly
as
if
they
had
been
a
carpet
and
under
them
was
another
carpet
of
lovely
green
moss
the
trees
and
the
birds
and
the
brook
and
the
flowers
were
prince
friends
he
loved
them
and
never
was
very
lonely
when
he
was
with
them
and
if
his
swine
had
not
run
away
so
often
and
if
the
swineherd
had
not
beaten
him
so
much
sometimes
indeed
nearly
all
summer
he
would
have
been
almost
happy
he
used
to
lie
on
the
fragrant
carpet
of
flowers
and
moss
and
listen
to
the
soft
sound
of
the
running
water
and
to
the
whispering
of
the
waving
leaves
and
to
the
songs
of
the
birds
and
he
would
wonder
what
they
were
saying
to
one
another
and
if
it
were
true
as
the
swineherd
children
said
that
the
great
forest
was
full
of
fairies
and
then
he
would
pretend
it
was
true
and
would
tell
himself
stories
about
them
and
make
believe
they
were
his
friends
and
that
they
came
to
talk
to
him
and
let
him
love
them
he
wanted
to
love
something
or
somebody
and
he
had
nothing
to
love
not
even
a
little
dog
one
day
he
was
resting
under
a
great
green
tree
feeling
really
quite
happy
because
everything
was
so
beautiful
he
had
even
made
a
little
song
to
chime
in
with
the
brook
and
he
was
singing
it
softly
and
sweetly
when
suddenly
as
he
lifted
his
curly
golden
head
to
look
about
him
he
saw
that
all
his
swine
were
gone
he
sprang
to
his
feet
feeling
very
much
frightened
and
he
whistled
and
called
but
he
heard
nothing
he
could
not
imagine
how
they
had
all
disappeared
so
quietly
without
making
any
sound
but
not
one
of
them
was
anywhere
to
be
seen
then
his
poor
little
heart
began
to
beat
fast
with
trouble
and
anxiety
he
ran
here
and
there
he
looked
through
the
bushes
and
under
the
trees
he
ran
and
ran
and
ran
and
called
and
whistled
and
searched
but
nowhere
nowhere
was
one
of
those
swine
to
be
found
he
searched
for
them
for
hours
going
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
forest
than
he
had
ever
been
before
he
saw
strange
trees
and
strange
flowers
and
heard
strange
sounds
and
at
last
the
sun
began
to
go
down
and
he
knew
he
would
soon
be
left
in
the
dark
his
little
feet
and
legs
were
scratched
with
brambles
and
were
so
tired
that
they
would
scarcely
carry
him
but
he
dared
not
go
back
to
the
swineherd
hut
without
finding
the
swine
the
only
comfort
he
had
on
all
the
long
way
was
that
the
little
brook
had
run
by
his
side
and
sung
its
song
to
him
and
sometimes
he
had
stopped
and
bathed
his
hot
face
in
it
and
had
said
oh
little
brook
you
are
so
kind
to
me
you
are
my
friend
i
know
i
would
be
so
lonely
without
you
when
at
last
the
sun
did
go
down
prince
fairyfoot
had
wandered
so
far
that
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
and
he
was
so
tired
that
he
threw
himself
down
by
the
brook
and
hid
his
face
in
the
flowery
moss
and
said
oh
little
brook
i
am
so
tired
i
can
go
no
further
and
i
can
never
find
them
while
he
was
lying
there
in
despair
he
heard
a
sound
in
the
air
above
him
and
looked
up
to
see
what
it
was
it
sounded
like
a
little
bird
in
some
trouble
and
surely
enough
there
was
a
huge
hawk
darting
after
a
plump
little
brown
bird
with
a
red
breast
the
little
bird
was
uttering
sharp
frightened
cries
and
prince
fairyfoot
felt
so
sorry
for
it
that
he
sprang
up
and
tried
to
drive
the
hawk
away
the
little
bird
saw
him
at
once
and
straightway
flew
to
him
and
fairyfoot
covered
it
with
his
cap
and
then
the
hawk
flew
away
in
a
great
rage
when
the
hawk
was
gone
fairyfoot
sat
down
again
and
lifted
his
cap
expecting
of
course
to
see
the
brown
bird
with
the
red
breast
but
in
stead
of
a
bird
out
stepped
a
little
man
not
much
higher
than
your
little
finger
a
plump
little
man
in
a
brown
suit
with
a
bright
red
vest
and
with
a
cocked
hat
on
why
exclaimed
fairyfoot
i
surprised
so
am
i
said
the
little
man
cheerfully
i
never
was
more
surprised
in
my
life
except
when
my
grandmother
got
into
such
a
rage
and
changed
me
into
a
i
tell
you
that
surprised
me
i
should
think
it
might
said
fairyfoot
why
did
she
do
it
mad
answered
the
little
man
that
was
what
was
the
matter
with
her
she
was
always
losing
her
temper
like
that
and
turning
people
into
awkward
things
and
then
being
sorry
for
it
and
not
being
able
to
change
them
back
again
if
you
are
a
fairy
you
have
to
be
careful
if
believe
me
that
woman
once
turned
her
into
a
mushroom
and
somebody
picked
her
and
she
was
made
into
catsup
which
is
a
thing
no
man
likes
to
have
happen
in
his
family
illustration
why
exclaimed
fairyfoot
i
surprised
of
course
not
said
fairyfoot
politely
the
difficulty
is
said
the
little
man
that
some
fairies
graduate
they
learn
to
turn
people
into
things
but
they
do
learn
how
to
unturn
them
and
then
when
they
get
mad
in
their
families
you
know
how
it
is
about
getting
mad
in
families
there
is
confusion
yes
seriously
confusion
arises
it
arises
that
was
the
way
with
my
grandmother
she
was
not
a
cultivated
old
person
and
she
did
not
know
how
to
unturn
people
and
now
you
see
the
result
quite
accidentally
i
trod
on
her
favorite
corn
she
got
mad
and
changed
me
into
a
robin
and
regretted
it
ever
afterward
i
could
only
become
myself
again
by
a
person
saving
me
from
a
great
danger
you
are
that
person
give
me
your
hand
fairyfoot
held
out
his
hand
the
little
man
looked
at
it
on
second
thought
he
said
i
ca
shake
it
it
too
large
i
sit
on
it
and
talk
to
you
with
these
words
he
hopped
upon
fairyfoot
hand
and
sat
down
smiling
and
clasping
his
own
hands
about
his
tiny
knees
i
declare
it
delightful
not
to
be
a
robin
he
said
had
to
go
about
picking
up
worms
you
know
disgusting
business
i
always
did
hate
worms
i
never
ate
them
myself
i
drew
the
line
there
but
i
had
to
get
them
for
my
family
suddenly
he
began
to
giggle
and
to
hug
his
knees
up
tight
do
you
wish
to
know
what
i
laughing
at
he
asked
fairyfoot
yes
fairyfoot
answered
the
little
man
giggled
more
than
ever
i
thinking
about
my
wife
he
said
the
one
i
had
when
i
was
a
robin
a
nice
rage
she
be
in
when
i
do
come
home
she
have
to
hustle
around
and
pick
up
worms
for
herself
and
for
the
children
too
and
it
serves
her
right
she
had
a
temper
that
would
embitter
the
life
of
a
crow
much
more
a
simple
robin
i
wore
myself
to
skin
and
bone
taking
care
of
her
and
her
brood
and
how
i
did
hate
bare
squawking
things
always
with
their
throats
gaping
open
they
seemed
to
think
a
parent
sole
duty
was
to
bring
worms
for
them
it
must
have
been
unpleasant
said
fairyfoot
it
was
more
than
that
said
the
little
man
it
used
to
make
my
feathers
stand
on
end
there
was
the
nest
too
fancy
being
changed
into
a
robin
and
being
obliged
to
build
a
nest
at
a
moment
notice
i
never
felt
so
ridiculous
in
my
life
how
was
i
to
know
how
to
build
a
nest
and
the
worst
of
it
was
the
way
she
went
on
about
it
she
said
fairyfoot
oh
her
you
know
replied
the
little
man
ungrammatically
my
wife
she
always
been
a
robin
and
she
knew
how
to
build
a
nest
she
liked
to
order
me
about
too
she
was
one
of
that
kind
but
of
course
i
going
to
own
that
i
did
know
anything
about
i
could
never
have
done
anything
with
her
in
the
world
if
i
let
her
think
she
knew
as
much
as
i
did
so
i
just
put
things
together
in
a
way
of
my
own
and
built
a
nest
that
would
have
made
you
weep
the
bottom
fell
out
of
it
the
first
night
it
nearly
killed
me
did
you
fall
out
too
inquired
fairyfoot
oh
no
answered
the
little
man
i
meant
that
it
nearly
killed
me
to
think
the
eggs
were
in
it
at
the
time
what
did
you
do
about
the
nest
asked
fairyfoot
the
little
man
winked
in
the
most
improper
manner
do
he
said
i
got
mad
of
course
and
told
her
that
if
she
interfered
it
would
have
happened
said
it
was
exactly
like
a
hen
to
fly
around
giving
advice
and
unsettling
one
mind
and
then
complain
if
things
were
right
i
told
her
she
might
build
the
nest
herself
if
she
thought
she
could
build
a
better
one
she
did
it
too
and
he
winked
again
was
it
a
better
one
asked
fairyfoot
the
little
man
actually
winked
a
third
time
it
may
surprise
you
to
hear
that
it
was
he
replied
but
it
did
surprise
me
he
added
with
startling
suddenness
what
your
name
and
what
the
matter
with
you
my
name
is
prince
fairyfoot
said
the
boy
and
i
have
lost
my
master
swine
my
name
said
the
little
man
is
robin
goodfellow
and
i
find
them
for
you
he
had
a
tiny
scarlet
silk
pouch
hanging
at
his
girdle
and
he
put
his
hand
into
it
and
drew
forth
the
smallest
golden
whistle
you
ever
saw
blow
that
he
said
giving
it
to
fairyfoot
and
take
care
that
you
do
swallow
it
you
are
such
a
tremendous
creature
fairyfoot
took
the
whistle
and
put
it
very
delicately
to
his
lips
he
blew
and
there
came
from
it
a
high
clear
sound
that
seemed
to
pierce
the
deepest
depths
of
the
forest
blow
again
commanded
robin
goodfellow
again
prince
fairyfoot
blew
and
again
the
pure
clear
sound
rang
through
the
trees
and
the
next
instant
he
heard
a
loud
rushing
and
tramping
and
squeaking
and
grunting
and
all
the
great
drove
of
swine
came
tearing
through
the
bushes
and
formed
themselves
into
a
circle
and
stood
staring
at
him
as
if
waiting
to
be
told
what
to
do
next
oh
robin
goodfellow
robin
goodfellow
cried
fairyfoot
how
grateful
i
am
to
you
not
as
grateful
as
i
am
to
you
said
robin
goodfellow
but
for
you
i
should
be
disturbing
that
hawk
digestion
at
the
present
moment
instead
of
which
here
i
am
a
respectable
fairy
once
more
and
my
late
wife
though
i
ought
not
to
call
her
that
for
goodness
knows
she
was
early
enough
hustling
me
out
of
my
nest
before
daybreak
with
the
unpleasant
proverb
about
the
early
bird
catching
the
worm
i
suppose
i
should
say
my
early
wife
is
at
this
juncture
a
widow
now
where
do
you
live
fairyfoot
told
him
and
told
him
also
about
the
swineherd
and
how
it
happened
that
though
he
was
a
prince
he
had
to
herd
swine
and
live
in
the
forest
well
well
said
robin
goodfellow
that
is
a
disagreeable
state
of
affairs
perhaps
i
can
make
it
rather
easier
for
you
you
see
that
is
a
fairy
whistle
i
thought
so
said
fairyfoot
well
continued
robin
goodfellow
you
can
always
call
your
swine
with
it
so
you
will
never
be
beaten
again
now
are
you
ever
lonely
sometimes
i
am
very
lonely
indeed
ananswered
the
prince
no
one
cares
for
me
though
i
think
the
brook
is
sometimes
sorry
and
tries
to
tell
me
things
of
course
said
robin
they
all
like
you
i
heard
them
say
so
oh
have
you
cried
fairyfoot
joyfully
yes
you
never
throw
stones
at
the
birds
or
break
the
branches
of
the
trees
or
trample
on
the
flowers
when
you
can
help
it
the
birds
sing
to
me
said
fairyfoot
and
the
trees
seem
to
beckon
to
me
and
whisper
and
when
i
am
very
lonely
i
lie
down
in
the
grass
and
look
into
the
eyes
of
the
flowers
and
talk
to
them
i
would
not
hurt
one
of
them
for
all
the
world
humph
said
robin
you
are
a
rather
good
little
fellow
would
you
like
to
go
to
a
party
a
party
said
fairyfoot
what
is
that
this
sort
of
thing
said
robin
and
he
jumped
up
and
began
to
dance
around
and
to
kick
up
his
heels
gaily
in
the
palm
of
hand
wine
you
know
and
cake
and
all
sorts
of
fun
it
begins
at
twelve
in
a
place
the
fairies
know
of
and
it
lasts
until
just
two
minutes
and
three
seconds
and
a
half
before
daylight
would
you
like
to
come
oh
cried
fairyfoot
i
should
be
so
happy
if
i
might
well
you
may
said
robin
i
take
you
they
be
delighted
to
see
any
friend
of
mine
i
a
great
favourite
of
course
you
can
easily
imagine
that
it
was
a
great
blow
to
them
when
i
was
changed
such
a
loss
you
know
in
fact
there
were
several
lady
fairies
who
but
no
matter
and
he
gave
a
slight
cough
and
began
to
arrange
his
necktie
with
a
disgracefully
consequential
air
though
he
was
trying
very
hard
not
to
look
conceited
and
while
he
was
endeavouring
to
appear
easy
and
gracefully
careless
he
began
accidentally
to
hum
see
the
conquering
hero
comes
which
was
not
the
right
tune
under
the
circumstances
but
for
you
he
said
next
i
could
have
given
them
the
relief
and
pleasure
of
seeing
me
this
evening
and
what
ecstasy
it
will
be
to
them
to
be
sure
i
should
be
surprised
if
it
broke
up
the
whole
thing
they
faint
so
for
joy
you
know
just
at
first
that
is
the
ladies
will
the
men
wo
like
it
at
all
and
i
do
blame
i
suppose
i
should
like
it
to
see
another
fellow
sweep
all
before
him
what
i
do
i
sweep
all
before
me
and
he
waved
his
hand
in
such
a
fine
large
gesture
that
he
overbalanced
himself
and
turned
a
somersault
but
he
jumped
up
after
it
quite
undisturbed
you
see
me
do
it
he
said
knocking
the
dents
out
of
his
hat
sweep
all
before
me
then
he
put
his
hat
on
and
his
hands
on
his
hips
with
a
swaggering
air
i
say
he
said
i
glad
you
going
i
should
like
you
to
see
it
and
i
should
like
to
see
it
replied
fairyfoot
well
said
goodfellow
you
deserve
it
though
that
saying
a
great
deal
you
restored
me
to
them
but
for
you
even
if
i
escaped
that
hawk
i
should
have
had
to
spend
the
night
in
that
beastly
nest
crowded
into
a
corner
by
those
squawking
things
and
domineered
over
by
her
i
was
made
for
that
i
superior
to
it
domestic
life
does
suit
me
i
was
made
for
society
i
adorn
it
she
never
appreciated
me
she
could
soar
to
it
when
i
think
of
the
way
she
treated
me
he
exclaimed
suddenly
getting
into
a
rage
i
a
great
mind
to
turn
back
into
a
robin
and
peck
her
head
off
would
you
like
to
see
her
now
asked
fairyfoot
innocently
goodfellow
glanced
behind
him
in
great
haste
and
suddenly
sat
down
no
no
he
exclaimed
in
a
tremendous
hurry
by
no
means
she
has
no
delicacy
and
she
does
deserve
to
see
me
and
there
a
violence
and
uncertainty
about
her
movements
which
is
annoying
beyond
anything
you
can
imagine
no
i
do
want
to
see
her
i
let
her
go
unpunished
for
the
present
perhaps
it
punishment
enough
for
her
to
be
deprived
of
me
just
pick
up
your
cap
wo
you
and
if
you
see
any
birds
lying
about
throw
it
at
them
robins
particularly
i
think
i
must
take
the
swine
home
if
you
excuse
me
said
fairyfoot
i
late
now
well
let
me
sit
on
your
shoulder
and
i
go
with
you
and
show
you
a
short
way
home
said
goodfellow
i
know
all
about
it
so
you
think
about
yourself
again
in
fact
we
talk
about
the
party
just
blow
your
whistle
and
the
swine
will
go
ahead
fairyfoot
did
so
and
the
swine
rushed
through
the
forest
before
them
and
robin
goodfellow
perched
himself
on
the
prince
shoulder
and
chatted
as
they
went
it
had
taken
fairyfoot
hours
to
reach
the
place
where
he
found
robin
but
somehow
it
seemed
to
him
only
a
very
short
time
before
they
came
to
the
open
place
near
the
swineherd
hut
and
the
path
they
had
walked
in
had
been
so
pleasant
and
flowery
that
it
had
been
delightful
all
the
way
now
said
robin
when
they
stopped
if
you
will
come
here
at
twelve
when
the
moon
shines
under
this
tree
you
will
find
me
waiting
for
you
now
i
going
and
he
was
gone
before
the
last
word
was
quite
finished
fairyfoot
went
towards
the
hut
driving
the
swine
before
him
and
suddenly
he
saw
the
swineherd
come
out
of
his
house
and
stand
staring
stupidly
at
the
pigs
he
was
a
very
coarse
hideous
man
with
bristling
yellow
hair
and
little
eyes
and
a
face
rather
like
a
pig
and
he
always
looked
stupid
but
just
now
he
looked
more
stupid
than
ever
he
seemed
dumb
with
surprise
what
the
matter
with
the
swine
he
asked
in
his
hoarse
voice
which
was
rather
piglike
too
i
do
know
answered
fairyfoot
feeling
a
little
alarmed
what
the
matter
with
them
they
are
four
times
fatter
and
five
times
bigger
and
six
times
cleaner
and
seven
times
heavier
and
eight
times
handsomer
than
they
were
when
you
took
them
out
the
swineherd
said
i
done
nothing
to
them
said
fairyfoot
they
ran
away
but
they
came
back
again
the
swineherd
went
lumbering
back
into
the
hut
and
called
his
wife
come
and
look
at
the
swine
he
said
and
then
the
woman
came
out
and
stared
first
at
the
swine
and
then
at
fairyfoot
he
has
been
with
the
fairies
she
said
at
last
to
her
husband
or
it
is
because
he
is
a
king
son
we
must
treat
him
better
if
he
can
do
wonders
like
that
illustration
what
the
matter
with
the
swine
he
asked
part
ii
in
went
the
shepherd
wife
and
she
prepared
quite
a
good
supper
for
fairyfoot
and
gave
it
to
him
but
fairyfoot
was
scarcely
hungry
at
all
he
was
so
eager
for
the
night
to
come
so
that
he
might
see
the
fairies
when
he
went
to
his
loft
under
the
roof
he
thought
at
first
that
he
could
not
sleep
but
suddenly
his
hand
touched
the
fairy
whistle
and
he
fell
asleep
at
once
and
did
not
waken
again
until
a
moonbeam
fell
brightly
upon
his
face
and
aroused
him
then
he
jumped
up
and
ran
to
the
hole
in
the
wall
to
look
out
and
he
saw
that
the
hour
had
come
and
the
moon
was
so
low
in
the
sky
that
its
slanting
light
had
crept
under
the
he
slipped
downstairs
so
lightly
that
his
master
heard
nothing
and
then
he
found
himself
out
in
the
beautiful
night
with
the
moonlight
so
bright
that
it
was
lighter
than
daytime
and
there
was
robin
goodfellow
waiting
for
him
under
the
tree
he
was
so
finely
dressed
that
for
a
moment
fairyfoot
scarcely
knew
him
his
suit
was
made
out
of
the
purple
velvet
petals
of
a
pansy
which
was
far
finer
than
any
ordinary
velvet
and
he
wore
plumes
and
tassels
and
a
ruffle
around
his
neck
and
in
his
belt
was
thrust
a
tiny
sword
not
half
as
big
as
the
finest
needle
take
me
on
your
shoulder
he
said
to
fairyfoot
and
i
will
show
you
the
way
fairyfoot
took
him
up
and
they
went
their
way
through
the
forest
and
the
strange
part
of
it
was
that
though
fairyfoot
thought
he
knew
ill
the
forest
by
heart
every
path
they
took
was
new
to
him
and
more
beautiful
than
anything
he
had
ever
seen
before
the
moonlight
seemed
to
grow
brighter
and
purer
at
every
step
and
the
sleeping
flowers
sweeter
and
lovelier
and
the
moss
greener
and
thicken
fairyfoot
felt
so
happy
and
gay
that
he
forgot
he
had
ever
been
sad
and
lonely
in
his
life
robin
goodfellow
too
seemed
to
be
in
very
good
spirits
he
related
a
great
many
stories
to
fairyfoot
and
singularly
enough
they
were
all
about
himself
and
divers
and
sundry
fairy
ladies
who
had
been
so
very
much
attached
to
him
that
he
scarcely
expected
to
find
them
alive
at
the
present
moment
he
felt
quite
sure
they
must
have
died
of
grief
in
his
absence
i
have
caused
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
the
course
of
my
life
he
said
regretfully
shaking
his
head
i
have
sometimes
wished
i
could
avoid
it
but
that
is
impossible
ahem
when
my
grandmother
rashly
and
inopportunely
changed
me
into
a
robin
i
was
having
a
little
flirtation
with
a
little
creature
who
was
really
quite
attractive
i
might
have
decided
to
engage
myself
to
her
she
was
very
charming
her
name
was
gauzita
i
shall
go
and
place
flowers
on
her
tomb
i
thought
fairies
never
died
said
fairyfoot
only
on
rare
occasions
and
only
from
love
answered
robin
they
need
die
unless
they
wish
to
they
have
been
known
to
do
it
through
love
they
frequently
wish
they
had
afterward
in
fact
invariably
and
then
they
can
come
to
life
again
but
gauzita
are
you
quite
sure
she
is
dead
asked
fairyfoot
sure
cried
goodfellow
in
wild
indignation
why
she
has
seen
me
for
a
couple
of
years
i
moulted
twice
since
last
we
met
i
congratulate
myself
that
she
did
see
me
then
he
added
in
a
lower
voice
of
course
she
dead
he
added
with
solemn
emphasis
as
dead
as
a
door
nail
just
then
fairyfoot
heard
some
enchanting
sounds
faint
but
clear
they
were
sounds
of
delicate
music
and
of
tiny
laughter
like
the
ringing
of
fairy
bells
ah
said
robin
goodfellow
there
they
are
but
it
seems
to
me
they
are
rather
gay
considering
they
have
not
seen
me
for
so
long
turn
into
the
path
almost
immediately
they
found
themselves
in
a
beautiful
little
dell
filled
with
moonlight
and
with
glittering
stars
in
the
cup
of
every
flower
for
there
were
thousands
of
dewdrops
and
every
dewdrop
shone
like
a
star
there
were
also
crowds
and
crowds
of
tiny
men
and
women
all
beautiful
all
dressed
in
brilliant
delicate
dresses
all
laughing
or
dancing
or
feasting
at
the
little
tables
which
were
loaded
with
every
dainty
the
most
fastidious
fairy
could
wish
for
now
said
robin
goodfellow
you
shall
see
me
sweep
all
before
me
put
me
down
fairyfoot
put
him
down
and
stood
and
watched
him
while
he
walked
forward
with
a
very
grand
manner
he
went
straight
to
the
gayest
and
largest
group
he
could
see
it
was
a
group
of
gentlemen
fairies
who
were
crowding
around
a
lily
of
the
valley
on
the
bent
stem
of
which
a
tiny
lady
fairy
was
sitting
airily
swaying
herself
to
and
fro
and
laughing
and
chatting
with
all
her
admirers
at
once
she
seemed
to
be
enjoying
herself
immensely
indeed
it
was
disgracefully
plain
that
she
was
having
a
great
deal
of
fun
one
gentleman
fairy
was
fanning
her
one
was
holding
her
programme
one
had
her
bouquet
another
her
little
scent
bottle
and
those
who
had
nothing
to
hold
for
her
were
scowling
furiously
at
the
rest
it
was
evident
that
she
was
very
popular
and
that
she
did
not
object
to
it
at
all
in
fact
the
way
her
eyes
sparkled
and
danced
was
distinctly
reprehensible
illustration
almost
immediately
they
found
themselves
in
a
beautiful
little
dell
you
have
engaged
to
dance
the
next
waltz
with
every
one
of
us
said
one
of
her
adorers
how
are
you
going
to
do
it
did
i
engage
to
dance
with
all
of
you
she
said
giving
her
lily
stem
the
sauciest
little
swing
which
set
all
the
bells
ringing
well
i
am
not
going
to
dance
it
with
all
not
with
the
admirer
with
the
fan
whispered
in
her
ear
she
gave
him
the
most
delightful
little
look
just
to
make
him
believe
she
wanted
to
dance
with
him
but
really
could
robin
goodfelllow
saw
her
and
then
she
smiled
sweetly
upon
all
the
rest
every
one
of
them
robin
goodfellow
saw
that
too
i
am
going
to
sit
here
and
look
at
you
and
let
you
talk
to
me
she
said
i
do
so
enjoy
brilliant
conversation
all
the
gentlemen
fairies
were
so
much
elated
by
this
that
they
began
to
brighten
up
and
settle
their
ruffs
and
fall
into
graceful
attitudes
and
think
of
sparkling
things
to
say
because
every
one
of
them
knew
from
the
glance
of
her
eyes
in
his
direction
that
he
was
one
whose
conversation
was
brilliant
every
one
knew
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
its
being
himself
that
she
meant
the
way
she
looked
just
proved
it
altogether
it
was
more
than
robin
goodfellow
could
stand
for
it
was
gauzita
who
was
deporting
herself
in
this
unaccountable
manner
swinging
on
lily
stems
and
going
on
so
to
speak
with
several
parties
at
once
in
a
way
to
chill
the
blood
of
any
proper
young
lady
fairy
who
any
partner
at
all
it
was
gauzita
herself
he
made
his
way
into
the
very
centre
of
the
group
gauzita
he
said
he
thought
of
course
she
would
drop
right
off
her
lily
stem
but
she
did
she
simply
stopped
swinging
a
moment
and
stared
at
him
gracious
she
exclaimed
and
who
are
you
who
am
i
cried
goodfellow
severely
do
you
remember
me
no
she
said
coolly
i
do
not
in
the
least
robin
goodfellow
almost
gasped
for
breath
he
had
never
met
with
anything
so
outrageous
in
his
life
you
do
remember
he
cried
why
it
impossible
is
it
said
gauzita
with
a
touch
of
dainty
impudence
your
name
robin
goodfellow
was
almost
paralyzed
gauzita
took
up
a
midget
of
an
eyeglass
which
she
had
dangling
from
a
thread
of
a
gold
chain
and
she
stuck
it
in
her
eye
and
tilted
her
impertinent
little
chin
and
looked
him
over
not
that
she
was
not
a
bit
of
it
it
was
just
one
of
her
tricks
and
manners
dear
me
she
said
you
do
look
a
trifle
familiar
it
is
it
be
then
she
turned
to
the
adorer
who
held
her
fan
it
ca
be
the
one
who
was
changed
into
a
robin
you
know
she
said
such
a
ridiculous
thing
to
be
changed
into
what
was
his
name
oh
yes
i
know
whom
you
mean
ah
goodfellow
said
the
fairy
with
the
fan
so
it
was
she
said
looking
robin
over
again
and
he
has
been
pecking
at
trees
and
things
and
hopping
in
and
out
of
nests
ever
since
i
suppose
how
absurd
and
we
have
been
enjoying
ourselves
so
much
since
he
went
away
i
think
i
never
have
so
lovely
a
time
as
i
have
had
during
these
last
two
years
i
began
to
know
you
she
added
in
a
kindly
tone
just
about
the
time
he
went
away
you
have
been
enjoying
yourself
almost
shrieked
robin
goodfellow
well
said
gauzita
in
unexcusable
slang
i
must
smile
and
she
did
smile
and
nobody
has
pined
away
and
died
cried
robin
i
have
said
gauzita
swinging
herself
and
ringing
her
bells
again
i
really
have
had
time
robin
goodfellow
turned
around
and
rushed
out
of
the
group
he
regarded
this
as
insulting
he
went
back
to
fairyfoot
in
such
a
hurry
that
he
tripped
on
his
sword
and
fell
and
rolled
over
so
many
times
that
fairyfoot
had
to
stop
him
and
pick
him
up
is
she
dead
asked
fairyfoot
no
said
robin
she
is
he
sat
down
on
a
small
mushroom
and
clasped
his
hands
about
his
knees
and
looked
mad
just
mad
angry
or
indignant
would
express
it
i
have
a
great
mind
to
go
and
be
a
misanthrope
he
said
oh
i
would
said
fairyfoot
he
did
know
what
a
misanthrope
was
but
he
thought
it
must
be
something
unpleasant
would
you
said
robin
looking
up
at
him
no
answered
fairyfoot
well
said
robin
i
guess
i
wo
let
go
and
have
some
fun
they
are
all
that
way
you
ca
depend
on
any
of
them
never
trust
one
of
them
i
believe
that
creature
has
been
engaged
as
much
as
twice
since
i
left
by
a
singular
coincidence
he
added
i
have
been
married
twice
myself
but
of
course
that
different
i
a
man
you
know
and
well
it
different
we
wo
dwell
on
it
let
go
and
dance
but
wait
a
minute
first
he
took
a
little
bottle
from
his
pocket
if
you
remain
the
size
you
are
he
continued
you
will
tread
on
whole
sets
of
lancers
and
destroy
entire
germans
if
you
drink
this
you
will
become
as
small
as
we
are
and
then
when
you
are
going
home
i
will
give
you
something
to
make
you
large
again
fairyfoot
drank
from
the
little
flagon
and
immediately
he
felt
himself
growing
smaller
and
smaller
until
at
last
he
was
as
small
as
his
companion
now
come
on
said
robin
on
they
went
and
joined
the
fairies
and
they
danced
and
played
fairy
games
and
feasted
on
fairy
dainties
and
were
so
gay
and
happy
that
fairyfoot
was
wild
with
joy
everybody
made
him
welcome
and
seemed
to
like
him
and
the
lady
fairies
were
simply
delightful
especially
gauzita
who
took
a
great
fancy
to
him
just
before
the
sun
rose
robin
gave
him
something
from
another
flagon
and
he
grew
large
again
and
two
minutes
and
three
seconds
and
a
half
before
daylight
the
ball
broke
up
and
robin
took
him
home
and
left
him
promising
to
call
for
him
the
next
night
every
night
throughout
the
whole
summer
the
same
thing
happened
at
midnight
he
went
to
the
fairies
dance
and
at
two
minutes
and
three
seconds
and
a
half
before
dawn
he
came
home
he
was
never
lonely
any
more
because
all
day
long
he
could
think
of
what
pleasure
he
would
have
when
the
night
came
and
besides
that
all
the
fairies
were
his
friends
but
when
the
summer
was
coming
to
an
end
robin
goodfellow
said
to
him
this
is
our
last
dance
at
least
it
will
be
our
last
for
some
time
at
this
time
of
the
year
we
always
go
back
to
our
own
country
and
we
return
until
spring
this
made
fairyfoot
very
sad
he
did
not
know
how
he
could
bear
to
be
left
alone
again
but
he
knew
it
could
not
be
helped
so
he
tried
to
be
as
cheerful
as
possible
and
he
went
to
the
final
festivities
and
enjoyed
himself
more
than
ever
before
and
gauzita
gave
him
a
tiny
ring
for
a
parting
gift
but
the
next
night
when
robin
did
not
come
for
him
he
felt
very
lonely
indeed
and
the
next
day
he
was
so
sorrowful
that
he
wandered
far
away
into
the
forest
in
the
hope
of
finding
something
to
cheer
him
a
little
he
wandered
so
far
that
he
became
very
tired
and
thirsty
and
he
was
just
making
up
his
mind
to
go
home
when
he
thought
he
heard
the
sound
of
falling
water
it
seemed
to
come
from
behind
a
thicket
of
climbing
roses
and
he
went
towards
the
place
and
pushed
the
branches
aside
a
little
so
that
he
could
look
through
what
he
saw
was
a
great
surprise
to
him
though
it
was
the
end
of
summer
inside
the
thicket
the
roses
were
blooming
in
thousands
all
around
a
pool
as
clear
as
crystal
into
which
the
sparkling
water
fell
from
a
hole
in
the
rock
above
it
was
the
most
beautiful
clear
pool
that
fairyfoot
had
ever
seen
and
he
pressed
his
way
through
the
rose
branches
and
entering
the
circle
they
inclosed
he
knelt
by
the
water
and
drank
almost
instantly
his
feeling
of
sadness
left
him
and
he
felt
quite
happy
and
refreshed
he
stretched
himself
on
the
thick
perfumed
moss
and
listened
to
the
tinkling
of
the
water
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
fell
asleep
when
he
awakened
the
moon
was
shining
the
pool
sparkled
like
a
silver
plaque
crusted
with
diamonds
and
two
nightingales
were
singing
in
the
branches
over
his
head
and
the
next
moment
he
found
out
that
he
understood
their
language
just
as
plainly
as
if
they
had
been
human
beings
instead
of
birds
the
water
with
which
he
had
quenched
his
thirst
was
enchanted
and
had
given
him
this
new
power
poor
boy
said
one
nightingale
he
looks
tired
i
wonder
where
he
came
from
why
my
dear
said
the
other
is
it
possible
you
do
know
that
he
is
prince
fairyfoot
what
said
the
first
nightingale
the
king
of
stumpinghame
son
who
was
born
with
small
feet
yes
said
the
second
and
the
poor
child
has
lived
in
the
forest
keeping
the
swineherd
pigs
ever
since
and
he
is
a
very
nice
boy
too
never
throws
stones
at
birds
or
robs
nests
what
a
pity
he
does
know
about
the
pool
where
the
red
berries
grow
said
the
first
nightingale
part
iii
what
pool
and
what
red
berries
asked
the
second
nightingale
why
my
dear
said
the
first
is
it
possible
you
do
know
about
the
pool
where
the
red
berries
grow
the
pool
where
the
poor
dear
princess
goldenhair
met
with
her
misfortune
never
heard
of
it
said
the
second
nightingale
rather
crossly
well
explained
the
other
you
have
to
follow
the
brook
for
a
day
and
and
then
take
all
the
paths
to
the
left
until
you
come
to
the
pool
it
is
very
ugly
and
muddy
and
bushes
with
red
berries
on
them
grow
around
it
well
what
of
that
said
her
companion
and
what
happened
to
the
princess
goldenhair
do
you
know
that
either
exclaimed
her
friend
no
ah
said
the
first
nightingale
it
was
very
sad
she
went
out
with
her
father
the
king
who
had
a
hunting
party
and
she
lost
her
way
and
wandered
on
until
she
came
to
the
pool
her
poor
little
feet
were
so
hot
that
she
took
off
her
satin
slippers
and
put
them
into
the
water
her
feet
not
the
slippers
and
the
next
minute
they
began
to
grow
and
grow
and
to
get
larger
and
larger
until
they
were
so
immense
she
could
hardly
walk
at
all
and
though
all
the
physicians
in
the
kingdom
have
tried
to
make
them
smaller
nothing
can
be
done
and
she
is
perfectly
unhappy
what
a
pity
she
does
know
about
this
pool
said
the
other
bird
if
she
just
came
here
and
bathed
them
three
times
in
the
water
they
would
be
smaller
and
more
beautiful
than
ever
and
she
would
be
more
lovely
than
she
has
ever
been
it
is
a
pity
said
her
companion
but
you
know
if
we
once
let
people
know
what
this
water
will
do
we
should
be
overrun
with
creatures
bathing
themselves
beautiful
and
trampling
our
moss
and
tearing
down
our
and
we
should
never
have
any
peace
that
is
true
agreed
the
other
very
soon
after
they
flew
away
and
fairyfoot
was
left
alone
he
had
been
so
excited
while
they
were
talking
that
he
had
been
hardly
able
to
lie
still
he
was
so
sorry
for
the
princess
goldenhair
and
so
glad
for
himself
now
he
could
find
his
way
to
the
pool
with
the
red
berries
and
he
could
bathe
his
feet
in
it
until
they
were
large
enough
to
satisfy
stumpinghame
and
he
could
go
back
to
his
father
court
and
his
parents
would
perhaps
be
fond
of
him
but
he
had
so
good
a
heart
that
he
could
not
think
of
being
happy
himself
and
letting
others
remain
unhappy
when
he
could
help
them
so
the
first
thing
was
to
find
the
princess
goldenhair
and
tell
her
about
the
nightingales
fountain
but
how
was
he
to
find
her
the
nightingales
had
not
told
him
he
was
very
much
troubled
indeed
how
was
he
to
find
her
suddenly
quite
suddenly
he
thought
of
the
ring
gauzita
had
given
him
when
she
had
given
it
to
him
she
had
made
an
odd
remark
when
you
wish
to
go
anywhere
she
had
said
hold
it
in
your
hand
turn
around
twice
with
closed
eyes
and
something
queer
will
happen
he
had
thought
it
was
one
of
her
little
jokes
but
now
it
occurred
to
him
that
at
least
he
might
try
what
would
happen
so
he
rose
up
held
the
ring
in
his
hand
closed
his
eyes
and
turned
around
twice
what
did
happen
was
that
he
began
to
walk
not
very
fast
but
still
passing
along
as
if
he
were
moving
rapidly
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
going
but
he
guessed
that
the
ring
did
and
that
if
he
obeyed
it
he
should
find
the
princess
goldenhair
he
went
on
and
on
not
getting
in
the
least
tired
until
about
daylight
he
found
himself
under
a
great
tree
and
on
the
ground
beneath
it
was
spread
a
delightful
breakfast
which
he
knew
was
for
him
he
sat
down
and
ate
it
and
then
got
up
again
and
went
on
his
way
once
more
before
noon
he
had
left
the
forest
behind
him
and
was
in
a
strange
country
he
knew
it
was
not
stumpinghame
because
the
people
had
not
large
feet
but
they
all
had
sad
faces
and
once
or
twice
when
he
passed
groups
of
them
who
were
talking
he
heard
them
speak
of
the
princess
goldenhair
as
if
they
were
sorry
for
her
and
could
not
enjoy
themselves
while
such
a
misfortune
rested
upon
her
so
sweet
and
lovely
and
kind
a
princess
they
said
and
it
really
seems
as
if
she
would
never
be
any
better
the
sun
was
just
setting
when
fairyfoot
came
in
sight
of
the
palace
it
was
built
of
white
marble
and
had
beautiful
about
it
but
somehow
there
seemed
to
be
a
settled
gloom
in
the
air
fairyfoot
had
entered
the
great
and
was
wondering
where
it
would
be
best
to
go
first
when
he
saw
a
lovely
white
fawn
with
a
golden
collar
about
its
neck
come
bounding
over
the
and
he
heard
at
a
little
distance
a
sweet
voice
saying
sorrowfully
come
back
my
fawn
i
can
not
run
and
play
with
you
as
i
once
used
to
do
not
leave
me
my
little
friend
and
soon
from
behind
the
trees
came
a
line
of
beautiful
girls
walking
two
by
two
all
very
slowly
and
at
the
head
of
the
line
first
of
all
came
the
loveliest
princess
in
the
world
dressed
softly
in
pure
white
with
a
wreath
of
lilies
on
her
long
golden
hair
which
fell
almost
to
the
hem
of
her
white
gown
she
had
so
fair
and
tender
a
young
face
and
her
large
soft
eyes
yet
looked
so
sorrowful
that
fairyfoot
loved
her
in
a
moment
and
he
knelt
on
one
knee
taking
off
his
cap
and
bending
his
head
until
his
own
golden
hair
almost
hid
his
face
beautiful
princess
goldenhair
beautiful
and
sweet
princess
may
i
speak
to
you
he
said
the
princess
stopped
and
looked
at
him
and
answered
him
softly
it
surprised
her
to
see
one
so
poorly
dressed
kneeling
before
her
in
her
palace
gardens
among
the
brilliant
flowers
but
she
always
spoke
softly
to
everyone
what
is
there
that
i
can
do
for
you
my
friend
she
said
beautiful
princess
answered
fairyfoot
blushing
i
hope
very
much
that
i
may
be
able
to
do
something
for
you
for
me
she
exclaimed
thank
you
friend
what
is
it
you
can
do
indeed
i
need
a
help
i
am
afraid
no
one
can
ever
give
me
gracious
and
fairest
lady
said
fairyfoot
it
is
that
help
i
think
nay
i
am
sure
that
i
bring
to
you
oh
said
the
sweet
princess
you
have
a
kind
face
and
most
true
eyes
and
when
i
look
at
you
i
do
not
know
why
it
is
but
i
feel
a
little
happier
what
is
it
you
would
say
to
me
still
kneeling
before
her
still
bending
his
head
modestly
and
still
blushing
fairyfoot
told
his
story
he
told
her
of
his
own
sadness
and
loneliness
and
of
why
he
was
considered
so
terrible
a
disgrace
to
his
family
he
told
her
about
the
fountain
of
the
nightingales
and
what
he
had
heard
there
and
how
he
had
journeyed
through
the
forests
and
beyond
it
into
her
own
country
to
find
her
and
while
he
told
it
her
beautiful
face
changed
from
red
to
white
and
her
hands
closely
clasped
themselves
together
oh
she
said
when
he
had
finished
i
know
that
this
is
true
from
the
kind
look
in
your
eyes
and
i
shall
be
happy
again
and
how
can
i
thank
you
for
being
so
good
to
a
poor
little
princess
whom
you
had
never
seen
only
let
me
see
you
happy
once
more
most
sweet
princess
answered
fairyfoot
and
that
will
be
all
i
desire
only
if
perhaps
i
might
once
kiss
your
hand
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
with
so
lovely
a
look
in
her
soft
eyes
that
he
felt
happier
than
he
had
ever
been
before
even
at
the
fairy
dances
this
was
a
different
kind
of
happiness
her
hand
was
as
white
as
a
wing
and
as
soft
as
a
dove
breast
come
she
said
let
us
go
at
once
to
the
king
illustration
fairyfoot
loved
her
ina
moment
and
he
knelt
on
one
knee
within
a
few
minutes
the
whole
palace
was
in
an
uproar
of
excitement
preparations
were
made
to
go
to
the
fountain
of
the
nightingales
immediately
remembering
what
the
birds
had
said
about
not
wishing
to
be
disturbed
fairyfoot
asked
the
king
to
take
only
a
small
party
so
no
one
was
to
go
but
the
king
himself
the
princess
in
a
covered
chair
carried
by
two
bearers
the
lord
high
chamberlain
two
maids
of
honour
and
fairyfoot
before
morning
they
were
on
their
way
and
the
day
after
they
reached
the
thicket
of
roses
and
fairyfoot
pushed
aside
the
branches
and
led
the
way
into
the
dell
the
princess
goldenhair
sat
down
upon
the
edge
of
the
pool
and
put
her
feet
into
it
in
two
minutes
they
began
to
look
smaller
she
bathed
them
once
twice
three
times
and
as
the
nightingales
had
said
they
became
smaller
and
more
beautiful
than
ever
as
for
the
princess
herself
she
really
could
not
be
more
beautiful
than
she
had
been
but
the
lord
high
chamberlain
who
had
been
an
exceedingly
ugly
old
gentleman
after
washing
his
face
became
so
young
and
handsome
that
the
first
maid
of
honour
immediately
fell
in
love
with
him
whereupon
she
washed
her
face
and
became
so
beautiful
that
he
fell
in
love
with
her
and
they
were
engaged
upon
the
spot
the
princess
could
not
find
any
words
to
tell
fairyfoot
how
grateful
she
was
and
how
happy
she
could
only
look
at
him
again
and
again
with
her
soft
radiant
eyes
and
again
and
again
give
him
her
hand
that
he
might
kiss
it
she
was
so
sweet
and
gentle
that
fairyfoot
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
leaving
her
and
when
the
king
begged
him
to
return
to
the
palace
with
them
and
live
there
always
he
was
more
glad
than
i
can
tell
you
to
be
near
this
lovely
princess
to
be
her
friend
to
love
and
serve
her
and
look
at
her
every
day
was
such
happiness
that
he
wanted
nothing
more
but
first
he
wished
to
visit
his
father
and
mother
and
sisters
and
brothers
in
stumpinghame
so
the
king
and
princess
and
their
attendants
went
with
him
to
the
pool
where
the
red
berries
grew
and
after
he
had
bathed
his
feet
in
the
water
they
were
so
large
that
stumpinghame
contained
nothing
like
them
even
the
king
and
queen
seeming
small
in
comparison
and
when
a
few
days
later
he
arrived
at
the
stumpinghame
palace
attended
in
great
state
by
the
magnificent
retinue
with
which
the
father
of
the
princess
goldenhair
had
provided
him
he
was
received
with
unbounded
rapture
by
his
parents
the
king
and
queen
felt
that
to
have
a
son
with
feet
of
such
a
size
was
something
to
be
proud
of
indeed
they
could
not
admire
him
sufficiently
although
the
whole
country
was
illuminated
and
feasting
continued
throughout
his
visit
but
though
he
was
glad
to
be
no
more
a
disgrace
to
his
family
it
can
not
be
said
that
he
enjoyed
the
size
of
his
feet
very
much
on
his
own
account
indeed
he
much
preferred
being
prince
fairyfoot
as
fleet
as
the
wind
and
as
light
as
a
young
deer
and
he
was
quite
glad
to
go
to
the
fountain
of
the
nightingales
after
his
visit
was
at
an
end
and
bathe
his
feet
small
again
and
to
return
to
the
palace
of
the
princess
goldenhair
with
the
soft
and
tender
eyes
there
everyone
loved
him
and
he
loved
everyone
and
was
four
times
as
happy
as
the
day
is
long
he
loved
the
princess
more
dearly
every
day
and
of
course
as
soon
as
they
were
old
enough
they
were
married
and
of
course
too
they
used
to
go
in
the
summer
to
the
forest
and
dance
in
the
moonlight
with
the
fairies
who
adored
them
both
when
they
went
to
visit
stumpinghame
they
always
bathed
their
feet
in
the
pool
of
the
red
berries
and
when
they
returned
they
made
them
small
again
in
the
fountain
of
the
nightingales
they
were
always
great
friends
with
robin
goodfellow
and
he
was
always
very
confidential
with
them
about
gauzita
who
continued
to
be
as
pretty
and
saucy
as
ever
some
of
these
days
he
used
to
say
severely
i
marry
another
fairy
and
see
how
she
like
that
to
see
someone
else
basking
in
my
society
get
even
with
her
but
he
did
the
proud
little
grain
of
wheat
there
once
was
a
little
grain
of
wheat
which
was
very
proud
indeed
the
first
thing
it
remembered
was
being
very
much
crowded
and
jostled
by
a
great
many
other
grains
of
wheat
all
living
in
the
same
sack
in
the
granary
it
was
quite
dark
in
the
sack
and
no
one
could
move
about
and
so
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
sit
still
and
talk
and
think
the
proud
little
grain
of
wheat
talked
a
great
deal
but
did
not
think
quite
so
much
while
its
next
neighbour
thought
a
great
deal
and
only
talked
when
it
was
asked
questions
it
could
answer
it
used
to
say
that
when
it
thought
a
great
deal
it
could
remember
things
which
it
seemed
to
have
heard
a
long
time
ago
what
is
the
use
of
our
staying
here
so
long
doing
nothing
and
never
being
seen
by
anybody
the
proud
little
grain
once
asked
i
do
know
the
learned
grain
replied
i
do
know
the
answer
to
that
ask
me
another
why
ca
i
sing
like
the
birds
that
build
their
nests
in
the
roof
i
should
like
to
sing
instead
of
sitting
here
in
the
dark
because
you
have
no
voice
said
the
learned
grain
this
was
a
very
good
answer
indeed
why
did
someone
give
me
a
voice
then
why
did
they
said
the
proud
little
grain
getting
very
cross
the
learned
grain
thought
for
several
minutes
there
might
be
two
answers
to
that
she
said
at
last
one
might
be
that
nobody
had
a
voice
to
spare
and
the
other
might
be
that
you
have
nowhere
to
put
one
if
it
were
given
to
you
everybody
is
better
off
than
i
am
said
the
proud
little
grain
the
birds
can
fly
and
sing
the
children
can
play
and
shout
i
am
sure
i
can
get
no
rest
for
their
shouting
and
playing
there
are
two
little
boys
who
make
enough
noise
to
deafen
the
whole
sackful
of
us
ah
i
know
them
said
the
learned
grain
and
it
true
they
are
noisy
their
names
are
lionel
and
vivian
there
is
a
thin
place
in
the
side
of
the
sack
through
which
i
can
see
them
i
would
rather
stay
where
i
am
than
have
to
do
all
they
do
they
have
long
yellow
hair
and
when
they
stand
on
their
heads
the
straw
sticks
in
it
and
they
look
very
curious
i
heard
a
strange
thing
through
listening
to
them
the
other
day
what
was
it
asked
the
proud
grain
they
were
playing
in
the
straw
and
someone
came
in
to
them
it
was
a
lady
who
had
brought
them
something
on
a
plate
they
began
to
dance
and
shout
cake
it
cake
nice
little
mamma
for
bringing
us
cake
and
then
they
each
sat
down
with
a
piece
and
began
to
take
great
bites
out
of
it
i
shuddered
to
think
of
it
afterward
why
well
you
know
they
are
always
asking
questions
and
they
began
to
ask
questions
of
their
mamma
who
lay
down
in
the
straw
near
them
she
seemed
to
be
used
to
it
these
are
the
questions
vivian
asked
made
the
cake
cook
made
the
cook
did
he
make
her
for
did
he
make
her
white
did
he
make
you
black
he
cut
a
hole
in
heaven
and
drop
me
through
when
he
made
me
did
it
hurt
me
when
i
tumbled
such
a
long
way
she
said
she
know
to
all
but
the
two
first
and
then
he
asked
two
more
is
the
cake
made
of
sugar
eggs
and
butter
is
flour
made
of
it
was
the
answer
to
that
which
made
me
shudder
what
was
it
asked
the
proud
grain
she
said
it
was
made
of
wheat
i
do
see
the
advantage
of
being
rich
was
the
cake
rich
asked
the
proud
grain
their
mother
said
it
was
she
said
eat
it
so
fast
it
is
very
rich
ah
said
the
proud
grain
i
should
like
to
be
rich
it
must
be
very
fine
to
be
rich
if
i
am
ever
made
into
cake
i
mean
to
be
so
rich
that
no
one
will
dare
to
eat
me
at
all
ah
said
the
learned
grain
i
do
think
those
boys
would
be
afraid
to
eat
you
however
rich
you
were
they
are
not
afraid
of
richness
they
be
afraid
of
me
before
they
had
done
with
me
said
the
proud
grain
i
am
not
a
common
grain
of
wheat
wait
until
i
am
made
into
cake
but
gracious
me
there
does
seem
much
prospect
of
it
while
we
are
shut
up
here
how
dark
and
stuffy
it
is
and
how
we
are
crowded
and
what
a
stupid
lot
the
other
grains
are
i
tired
of
it
i
must
say
we
are
all
in
the
same
sack
said
the
learned
grain
very
quietly
it
was
a
good
many
days
after
that
that
something
happened
quite
early
in
the
morning
a
man
and
a
boy
came
into
the
granary
and
moved
the
sack
of
wheat
from
its
place
wakening
all
the
grains
from
their
last
nap
what
is
the
matter
said
the
proud
grain
who
is
daring
to
disturb
us
hush
whispered
the
learned
grain
in
the
most
solemn
manner
something
is
going
to
happen
something
like
this
happened
to
somebody
belonging
to
me
long
ago
i
seem
to
remember
it
when
i
think
very
hard
i
seem
to
remember
something
about
one
of
my
family
being
sown
what
is
sown
demanded
the
other
grain
it
is
being
thrown
into
the
earth
began
the
learned
grain
oh
what
a
passion
the
proud
grain
got
into
into
the
earth
she
shrieked
out
into
the
common
earth
the
earth
is
nothing
but
dirt
and
i
am
a
common
grain
of
wheat
i
wo
be
sown
i
will
be
sown
how
dare
anyone
sow
me
against
my
will
i
would
rather
stay
in
the
sack
but
just
as
she
was
saying
it
she
was
thrown
out
with
the
learned
grain
and
some
others
into
another
dark
place
and
carried
off
by
the
farmer
in
spite
of
her
temper
for
the
farmer
could
not
hear
her
voice
at
all
and
would
have
minded
if
he
had
because
he
knew
she
was
only
a
grain
of
wheat
and
ought
to
be
sown
so
that
some
good
might
come
of
her
well
she
was
carried
out
to
a
large
field
in
the
pouch
which
the
farmer
wore
at
his
belt
the
field
had
been
ploughed
and
there
was
a
sweet
smell
of
fresh
earth
in
the
air
the
sky
was
a
deep
deep
blue
but
the
air
was
cool
and
the
few
leaves
on
the
trees
were
brown
and
dry
and
looked
as
if
they
had
been
left
over
from
last
year
ah
said
the
learned
grain
it
was
just
such
a
day
as
this
when
my
grandfather
or
my
father
or
somebody
else
related
to
me
was
sown
i
think
i
remember
that
it
was
called
early
spring
as
for
me
said
the
proud
grain
fiercely
i
should
like
to
see
the
man
who
would
dare
to
sow
me
at
that
very
moment
the
farmer
put
his
big
brown
hand
into
the
bag
and
threw
her
as
she
thought
at
least
half
a
mile
from
them
he
had
not
thrown
her
so
far
as
that
however
and
she
landed
safely
in
the
shadow
of
a
clod
of
rich
earth
which
the
sun
had
warmed
through
and
through
she
was
quite
out
of
breath
and
very
dizzy
at
first
but
in
a
few
seconds
she
began
to
feel
better
and
could
not
help
looking
around
in
spite
of
her
anger
to
see
if
there
was
anyone
near
to
talk
to
but
she
saw
no
one
and
so
began
to
scold
as
usual
they
not
only
sow
me
she
called
out
but
they
throw
me
all
by
myself
where
i
can
have
no
company
at
all
it
is
disgraceful
then
she
heard
a
voice
from
the
other
side
of
the
clod
it
was
the
learned
grain
who
had
fallen
there
when
the
farmer
threw
her
out
of
his
pouch
do
be
angry
it
said
i
am
here
we
are
all
right
so
far
perhaps
when
they
cover
us
with
the
earth
we
shall
be
even
nearer
to
each
other
than
we
are
now
do
you
mean
to
say
they
will
cover
us
with
the
earth
asked
the
proud
grain
yes
was
the
answer
and
there
we
shall
lie
in
the
dark
and
the
rain
will
moisten
us
and
the
sun
will
warm
us
until
we
grow
larger
and
larger
and
at
last
burst
open
speak
for
yourself
said
the
proud
grain
i
shall
do
no
such
thing
but
it
all
happened
just
as
the
learned
grain
had
said
which
showed
what
a
wise
grain
it
was
and
how
much
it
had
found
out
just
by
thinking
hard
and
remembering
all
it
could
before
the
day
was
over
they
were
covered
snugly
up
with
the
soft
fragrant
brown
earth
and
there
they
lay
day
after
day
one
morning
when
the
proud
grain
wakened
it
found
itself
wet
through
and
through
with
rain
which
had
fallen
in
the
night
and
the
next
day
the
sun
shone
down
and
warmed
it
so
that
it
really
began
to
be
afraid
that
it
would
be
obliged
to
grow
too
large
for
its
skin
which
felt
a
little
tight
for
it
already
it
said
nothing
of
this
to
the
learned
grain
at
first
because
it
was
determined
not
to
burst
if
it
could
help
it
but
after
the
same
thing
had
happened
a
great
many
times
it
found
one
morning
that
it
really
was
swelling
and
it
felt
obliged
to
tell
the
learned
grain
about
it
well
it
said
pettishly
i
suppose
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
you
were
right
i
going
to
burst
my
skin
is
so
tight
now
that
it
does
fit
me
at
all
and
i
know
i
ca
stand
another
warm
shower
like
the
last
oh
said
the
learned
grain
in
a
quiet
way
really
learned
people
always
have
a
quiet
way
i
knew
i
was
right
or
i
should
have
said
so
i
hope
you
do
find
it
very
uncomfortable
i
think
i
myself
shall
burst
by
of
course
i
find
it
uncomfortable
said
the
proud
grain
who
find
it
uncomfortable
to
be
two
or
three
sizes
too
small
for
one
self
pouf
crack
there
i
go
i
have
split
up
all
up
my
right
side
and
i
must
say
it
a
relief
crack
pouf
so
have
i
said
the
learned
grain
now
we
must
begin
to
push
up
through
the
earth
i
am
sure
my
relation
did
that
well
i
should
mind
getting
out
into
the
air
it
would
be
a
change
at
least
so
each
of
them
began
to
push
her
way
through
the
earth
as
strongly
as
she
could
and
sure
enough
it
was
not
long
before
the
proud
grain
actually
found
herself
out
in
the
world
again
breathing
the
sweet
air
under
the
blue
sky
across
which
fleecy
white
clouds
were
drifting
and
happy
birds
darting
it
really
is
a
lovely
day
were
the
first
words
the
proud
grain
said
it
could
help
it
the
sunshine
was
so
delightful
and
the
birds
chirped
and
twittered
so
merrily
in
the
bare
branches
and
more
wonderful
than
all
the
great
field
was
brown
no
longer
but
was
covered
with
millions
of
little
fresh
green
blades
which
trembled
and
bent
their
frail
bodies
before
the
light
wind
this
an
improvement
said
the
proud
grain
then
there
was
a
little
stir
in
the
earth
beside
it
and
up
through
the
brown
mould
came
the
learned
grain
fresh
bright
green
like
the
rest
i
told
you
i
was
not
a
common
grain
of
wheat
said
the
proud
one
you
are
not
a
grain
of
wheat
at
all
now
said
the
learned
one
modestly
you
are
a
blade
of
wheat
and
there
are
a
great
many
others
like
you
see
how
green
i
am
said
the
proud
blade
yes
you
are
very
green
said
its
companion
you
will
not
be
so
green
when
you
are
older
the
proud
grain
which
must
be
called
a
blade
now
had
plenty
of
change
and
company
after
this
it
grew
taller
and
taller
every
day
and
made
a
great
many
new
acquaintances
as
the
weather
grew
warmer
these
were
little
gold
and
green
beetles
living
near
it
who
often
passed
it
and
now
and
then
stopped
to
talk
a
little
about
their
children
and
their
journeys
under
the
soil
birds
dropped
down
from
the
sky
sometimes
to
gossip
and
twitter
of
the
nests
they
were
building
in
the
and
the
new
songs
they
were
learning
to
sing
once
on
a
very
warm
day
a
great
golden
butterfly
floating
by
on
his
large
lovely
wings
fluttered
down
softly
and
lit
on
the
proud
blade
who
felt
so
much
prouder
when
he
did
it
that
she
trembled
for
joy
he
admires
me
more
than
all
the
rest
in
the
field
you
see
it
said
haughtily
that
is
because
i
am
so
green
if
i
were
you
said
the
learned
blade
in
its
modest
way
i
believe
i
would
not
talk
so
much
about
being
green
people
will
make
such
remarks
when
one
speaks
often
of
one
self
i
am
above
such
people
said
the
proud
blade
i
can
find
nothing
more
interesting
to
talk
of
than
myself
as
time
went
on
it
was
delighted
to
find
that
it
grew
taller
than
any
other
blade
in
the
field
and
threw
out
other
blades
and
at
last
there
grew
out
at
the
top
of
its
stalk
ever
so
many
plump
new
little
grains
all
fitting
closely
together
and
wearing
tight
little
green
covers
look
at
me
it
said
then
i
am
the
queen
of
all
the
wheat
i
have
a
crown
no
said
its
learned
companion
you
are
now
an
ear
of
wheat
and
in
a
short
time
all
the
other
stalks
wore
the
same
kind
of
crown
and
it
found
out
that
the
learned
blade
was
right
and
that
it
was
only
an
ear
after
all
and
now
the
weather
had
grown
still
warmer
and
the
trees
were
covered
with
leaves
and
the
birds
sang
and
built
their
nests
in
them
and
laid
their
little
blue
eggs
and
in
time
wonderful
to
relate
there
came
baby
birds
that
were
always
opening
their
mouths
for
food
and
crying
peep
peep
to
their
fathers
and
mothers
there
were
more
butterflies
floating
about
on
their
amber
and
purple
wings
and
the
gold
and
green
beetles
were
so
busy
they
had
no
time
to
talk
well
said
the
proud
ear
of
wheat
you
remember
it
was
an
ear
by
this
time
to
its
companion
one
day
you
see
you
were
right
again
i
am
not
so
green
as
i
was
i
am
turning
yellow
but
yellow
is
the
colour
of
gold
and
i
do
object
to
looking
like
gold
you
will
soon
be
ripe
said
its
friend
and
what
will
happen
then
the
will
come
and
cut
you
down
and
other
strange
things
will
happen
there
i
make
a
stand
said
the
proud
ear
i
will
be
cut
down
but
it
was
just
as
the
wise
ear
said
it
would
be
not
long
after
a
was
brought
and
driven
back
and
forth
in
the
fields
and
down
went
all
the
wheat
ears
before
the
great
knives
but
it
did
not
hurt
the
wheat
of
course
and
only
the
proud
ear
felt
angry
i
am
the
colour
of
gold
it
said
and
yet
they
have
dared
to
cut
me
down
what
will
they
do
next
i
wonder
what
they
did
next
was
to
bunch
it
up
with
other
wheat
and
tie
it
and
stack
it
together
and
then
it
was
carried
in
a
waggon
and
laid
in
the
barn
then
there
was
a
great
bustle
after
a
while
the
farmer
wife
and
daughters
and
her
two
servants
began
to
work
as
hard
as
they
could
the
threshers
are
coming
they
said
and
we
must
make
plenty
of
things
for
them
to
eat
so
they
made
pies
and
cakes
and
bread
until
their
cupboards
were
full
and
surely
enough
the
threshers
did
come
with
the
which
was
painted
red
and
went
puff
puff
puff
rattle
rattle
all
the
time
and
the
proud
wheat
was
threshed
out
by
it
and
found
itself
in
grains
again
and
very
much
out
of
breath
i
look
almost
as
i
was
at
first
it
said
only
there
are
so
many
of
me
i
am
grander
than
ever
now
i
was
only
one
grain
of
wheat
at
first
and
now
i
am
at
least
fifty
when
it
was
put
into
a
sack
it
managed
to
get
all
its
grains
together
in
one
place
so
that
it
might
feel
as
grand
as
possible
it
was
so
proud
that
it
felt
grand
however
much
it
was
knocked
about
it
did
not
lie
in
the
sack
very
long
this
time
before
something
else
happened
one
morning
it
heard
the
farmer
wife
saying
to
the
coloured
boy
take
this
yere
sack
of
wheat
to
the
mill
jerry
i
want
to
try
it
when
i
make
that
thar
cake
for
the
boarders
them
two
children
from
washington
city
are
powerful
hands
for
cake
so
jerry
lifted
the
sack
up
and
threw
it
over
his
shoulder
and
carried
it
out
into
the
now
we
are
going
to
travel
said
the
proud
wheat
do
let
us
be
separated
at
that
minute
there
were
heard
two
young
voices
shouting
jerry
take
us
in
the
waggon
let
us
go
to
mill
jerry
we
want
to
go
to
mill
and
these
were
the
very
two
boys
who
had
played
in
the
granary
and
made
so
much
noise
the
summer
before
they
had
grown
a
little
bigger
and
their
yellow
hair
was
longer
but
they
looked
just
as
they
used
to
with
their
strong
little
legs
and
big
brown
eyes
and
their
sailor
hats
set
so
far
back
on
their
heads
that
it
was
a
wonder
they
stayed
on
and
gracious
how
they
shouted
and
ran
what
does
yer
mar
say
asked
jerry
says
we
can
go
shouted
both
at
once
as
if
jerry
had
been
deaf
which
he
was
at
all
quite
the
contrary
so
jerry
who
was
very
lifted
them
in
and
cracked
his
whip
and
the
horses
started
off
it
was
a
long
ride
to
the
mill
but
lionel
and
vivian
were
not
too
tired
to
shout
again
when
they
reached
it
they
shouted
at
sight
of
the
creek
and
the
big
wheel
turning
round
and
round
slowly
with
the
water
dashing
and
pouring
and
foaming
over
it
what
turns
the
wheel
asked
vivian
the
water
honey
said
jerry
what
turns
the
water
well
now
honey
said
jerry
you
hev
me
thar
i
do
know
nuffin
it
what
a
boy
you
is
fur
axin
questions
then
he
carried
the
sack
in
to
the
miller
and
said
he
would
wait
until
the
wheat
was
ground
ground
said
the
proud
wheat
we
are
going
to
be
ground
i
hope
it
is
agreeable
let
us
keep
close
together
they
did
keep
close
together
but
it
was
very
agreeable
to
be
poured
into
a
hopper
and
then
crushed
into
fine
powder
between
two
big
stones
makes
nice
flour
said
the
miller
rubbing
it
between
his
fingers
flour
said
the
wheat
which
was
wheat
no
longer
now
i
am
flour
and
i
am
finer
than
ever
how
white
i
am
i
really
would
rather
be
white
than
green
or
gold
colour
i
wonder
where
the
learned
grain
is
and
if
it
is
as
fine
and
white
as
i
am
but
the
learned
grain
and
her
family
had
been
laid
away
in
the
granary
for
seed
wheat
before
the
waggon
reached
the
house
again
the
two
boys
were
fast
asleep
in
the
bottom
of
it
and
had
to
be
helped
out
just
as
the
sack
was
and
carried
in
the
sack
was
taken
into
the
kitchen
at
once
and
opened
and
even
in
its
wheat
days
the
flour
had
never
been
so
proud
as
it
was
when
it
heard
the
farmer
wife
say
i
going
to
make
this
into
cake
ah
it
said
i
thought
so
now
i
shall
be
rich
and
admired
by
everybody
the
farmer
wife
then
took
some
of
it
out
in
a
large
white
bowl
and
after
that
she
busied
herself
beating
eggs
and
sugar
and
butter
all
together
in
another
bowl
and
after
a
while
she
took
the
flour
and
beat
it
in
also
now
i
am
in
grand
company
said
the
flour
the
eggs
and
butter
are
the
colour
of
gold
the
sugar
is
like
silver
or
diamonds
this
is
the
very
society
for
me
the
cake
looks
rich
said
one
of
the
daughters
it
rather
too
rich
for
them
children
said
her
mother
but
lawsey
i
dunno
neither
nothin
do
hurt
i
reckon
they
could
eat
a
panel
of
rail
fence
and
come
to
no
harm
i
rich
said
the
flour
to
itself
that
is
just
what
i
intended
from
the
first
i
am
rich
and
i
am
a
cake
just
then
a
pair
of
big
brown
eyes
came
and
peeped
into
it
they
belonged
to
a
round
little
head
with
a
mass
of
tangled
curls
all
over
it
they
belonged
to
vivian
what
that
he
asked
cake
who
made
it
i
did
i
like
you
said
vivian
you
such
a
nice
woman
who
going
to
eat
any
of
it
is
lionel
i
afraid
it
too
rich
for
boys
said
the
woman
but
she
laughed
and
kissed
him
no
said
vivian
i
afraid
it
is
i
shall
be
much
too
rich
said
the
cake
angrily
boys
indeed
i
was
made
for
something
better
than
boys
after
that
it
was
poured
into
a
and
put
into
the
oven
where
it
had
rather
an
unpleasant
time
of
it
it
was
so
hot
in
there
that
if
the
farmer
wife
had
not
watched
it
carefully
it
would
have
been
burned
but
i
am
cake
it
said
and
of
the
richest
kind
so
i
can
bear
it
even
if
it
is
uncomfortable
when
it
was
taken
out
it
really
was
cake
and
it
felt
as
if
it
was
quite
satisfied
everyone
who
came
into
the
kitchen
and
saw
it
said
oh
what
a
nice
cake
how
well
your
new
flour
has
done
but
just
once
while
it
was
cooling
it
had
a
curious
disagreeable
feeling
it
found
all
at
once
that
the
two
boys
lionel
and
vivian
had
come
quietly
into
the
kitchen
and
stood
near
the
table
looking
at
the
cake
with
their
great
eyes
wide
open
and
their
little
red
mouths
open
too
dear
me
it
said
how
nervous
i
feel
actually
nervous
what
great
eyes
they
have
and
how
they
shine
and
what
are
those
sharp
white
things
in
their
mouths
i
really
do
like
them
to
look
at
me
in
that
way
it
seems
like
something
personal
i
wish
the
farmer
wife
would
come
such
a
chill
ran
over
it
that
it
was
quite
cool
when
the
woman
came
in
and
she
put
it
away
in
the
cupboard
on
a
plate
but
that
very
afternoon
she
took
it
out
again
and
set
it
on
the
table
on
a
glass
she
put
some
leaves
around
it
to
make
it
look
nice
and
it
noticed
there
were
a
great
many
other
things
on
the
table
and
they
all
looked
fresh
and
bright
this
is
all
in
my
honour
it
said
they
know
i
am
rich
then
several
people
came
in
and
took
chairs
around
the
table
they
all
come
to
sit
and
look
at
me
said
the
vain
cake
i
wish
the
learned
grain
could
see
me
now
there
was
a
little
on
each
side
of
the
table
and
at
first
these
were
empty
but
in
a
few
minutes
the
door
opened
and
in
came
the
two
little
boys
they
had
pretty
clean
dresses
on
and
their
bangs
and
curls
were
bright
with
being
brushed
even
they
have
been
dressed
up
to
do
me
honour
thought
the
cake
illustration
there
the
cake
he
said
but
the
next
minute
it
began
to
feel
quite
nervous
again
chair
was
near
the
glass
stand
and
when
he
had
climbed
up
and
seated
himself
he
put
one
elbow
on
the
table
and
rested
his
fat
chin
on
his
fat
hand
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
cake
sat
and
stared
at
it
in
such
an
unnaturally
quiet
manner
for
some
seconds
that
any
cake
might
well
have
felt
nervous
there
the
cake
he
said
at
last
in
such
a
deeply
thoughtful
voice
that
the
cake
felt
faint
with
anger
then
a
remarkable
thing
happened
some
one
drew
the
stand
toward
them
and
took
the
knife
and
cut
out
a
large
slice
of
the
cake
go
away
said
the
cake
though
no
one
heard
it
i
am
cake
i
am
rich
i
am
not
for
boys
how
dare
you
vivian
stretched
out
his
hand
he
took
the
slice
he
lifted
it
up
and
then
the
cake
saw
his
red
mouth
open
yes
open
wider
than
it
could
have
believed
possible
wide
enough
to
show
two
dreadful
rows
of
little
sharp
white
things
good
gra
it
began
but
it
never
said
cious
never
at
all
for
in
two
minutes
vivian
had
eaten
it
and
there
was
an
end
of
its
airs
and
graces
behind
the
white
brick
it
began
with
aunt
hetty
being
out
of
temper
which
it
must
be
confessed
was
nothing
new
at
its
best
aunt
hetty
temper
was
none
of
the
most
charming
and
this
morning
it
was
at
its
worst
she
had
awakened
to
the
consciousness
of
having
a
hard
day
work
before
her
and
she
had
awakened
late
and
so
everything
had
gone
wrong
from
the
first
there
was
a
sharp
ring
in
her
voice
when
she
came
to
jem
bedroom
door
and
called
out
jemima
get
up
this
minute
jem
knew
what
to
expect
when
aunt
hetty
began
a
day
by
calling
her
jemima
it
was
one
of
the
poor
child
grievances
that
she
had
been
given
such
an
ugly
name
in
all
the
books
she
had
read
and
she
had
read
a
great
many
jem
never
had
met
a
heroine
who
was
called
jemima
but
it
had
been
her
mother
favorite
sister
name
and
so
it
had
fallen
to
her
lot
her
mother
always
called
her
jem
or
mimi
which
was
much
prettier
and
even
aunt
hetty
only
reserved
jemima
for
unpleasant
state
occasions
it
was
a
dreadful
day
to
jem
her
mother
was
not
at
home
and
would
not
be
until
night
she
had
been
called
away
unexpectedly
and
had
been
obliged
to
leave
jem
and
the
baby
to
aunt
hetty
mercies
so
jem
found
herself
busy
enough
scarcely
had
she
finished
doing
one
thing
when
aunt
hetty
told
her
to
begin
another
she
wiped
dishes
and
picked
fruit
and
attended
to
the
baby
and
when
baby
had
gone
to
sleep
and
everything
else
seemed
disposed
of
for
a
time
at
least
she
was
so
tired
that
she
was
glad
to
sit
down
and
then
she
thought
of
the
book
she
had
been
reading
the
night
before
a
certain
delightful
story
book
about
a
little
girl
whose
name
was
flora
and
who
was
so
happy
and
rich
and
pretty
and
good
that
jem
had
likened
her
to
the
little
princesses
one
reads
about
to
whose
christening
feast
every
fairy
brings
a
gift
i
shall
have
time
to
finish
my
chapter
before
comes
said
jem
and
she
sat
down
snugly
in
one
corner
of
the
wide
old
fashioned
fireplace
but
she
had
not
read
more
than
two
pages
before
something
dreadful
happened
aunt
hetty
came
into
the
room
in
a
great
hurry
in
such
a
hurry
indeed
that
she
caught
her
foot
in
the
matting
and
fell
striking
her
elbow
sharply
against
a
chair
which
so
upset
her
temper
that
the
moment
she
found
herself
on
her
feet
she
flew
at
jem
what
she
said
snatching
the
book
from
her
reading
again
when
i
am
running
all
over
the
house
for
you
and
she
flung
the
pretty
little
blue
covered
volume
into
the
fire
jem
sprang
to
rescue
it
with
a
cry
but
it
was
impossible
to
reach
it
it
had
fallen
into
a
great
hollow
of
red
coal
and
the
blaze
caught
it
at
once
you
are
a
wicked
woman
cried
jem
in
a
dreadful
passion
to
aunt
hetty
you
are
a
wicked
woman
then
matters
reached
a
climax
aunt
hetty
boxed
her
ears
pushed
her
back
on
her
little
footstool
and
walked
out
of
the
room
jem
hid
her
face
on
her
arms
and
cried
as
if
her
heart
would
break
she
cried
until
her
eyes
were
heavy
and
she
thought
she
would
be
obliged
to
go
to
sleep
but
just
as
she
was
thinking
of
going
to
sleep
something
fell
down
the
chimney
and
made
her
look
up
it
was
a
piece
of
mortar
and
it
brought
a
good
deal
of
soot
with
it
she
bent
forward
and
looked
up
to
see
where
it
had
come
from
the
chimney
was
so
very
wide
that
this
was
easy
enough
she
could
see
where
the
mortar
had
fallen
from
the
side
and
left
a
white
patch
how
white
it
looks
against
the
black
said
jem
it
is
like
a
white
brick
among
the
black
ones
what
a
queer
place
a
chimney
is
i
can
see
a
bit
of
the
blue
sky
i
think
and
then
a
funny
thought
came
into
her
fanciful
little
head
what
a
many
things
were
burned
in
the
big
fireplace
and
vanished
in
smoke
or
tinder
up
the
chimney
where
did
everything
go
there
was
flora
for
instance
flora
who
was
represented
on
the
frontispiece
with
lovely
soft
flowing
hair
and
a
little
fringe
on
her
pretty
round
forehead
crowned
with
a
circlet
of
daisies
and
a
laugh
in
her
round
eyes
where
was
she
by
this
time
certainly
there
was
nothing
left
of
her
in
the
fire
jem
almost
began
to
cry
again
at
the
thought
it
was
too
bad
she
said
she
was
so
pretty
and
funny
and
i
did
like
her
so
i
daresay
it
scarcely
will
be
credited
by
unbelieving
people
when
i
tell
them
what
happened
next
it
was
such
a
very
singular
thing
indeed
jem
felt
herself
gradually
lifted
off
her
little
footstool
oh
she
said
timidly
i
feel
very
light
she
did
feel
light
indeed
she
felt
so
light
that
she
was
sure
she
was
rising
gently
in
the
air
oh
she
said
again
how
how
very
light
i
feel
oh
dear
i
going
up
the
chimney
it
was
rather
strange
that
she
never
thought
of
calling
for
help
but
she
did
not
she
was
not
easily
frightened
and
now
she
was
only
wonderfully
astonished
as
she
remembered
afterwards
she
shut
her
eyes
tight
and
gave
a
little
gasp
i
heard
aunt
hetty
talk
about
the
draught
drawing
things
up
the
chimney
but
i
never
knew
it
was
as
strong
as
this
she
said
she
went
up
up
up
quietly
and
steadily
and
without
any
uncomfortable
feeling
at
all
and
then
all
at
once
she
stopped
feeling
that
her
feet
rested
against
something
solid
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
about
her
and
there
she
was
standing
right
opposite
the
white
brick
her
feet
on
a
tiny
ledge
well
she
said
this
is
funny
but
the
next
thing
that
happened
was
funnier
still
she
found
that
without
thinking
what
she
was
doing
she
was
knocking
on
the
white
brick
with
her
knackles
as
if
it
was
a
door
and
she
expected
somebody
to
open
it
the
next
minute
she
heard
footsteps
and
then
a
sound
as
if
some
one
was
drawing
back
a
little
bolt
it
is
a
door
said
jem
and
somebody
is
going
to
open
it
the
white
brick
moved
a
little
and
some
more
mortar
and
soot
fell
then
the
brick
moved
a
little
more
and
then
it
slid
aside
and
left
an
open
space
it
a
room
cried
jem
there
a
room
behind
it
and
so
there
was
and
before
the
open
space
stood
a
pretty
little
girl
with
long
lovely
hair
and
a
fringe
on
her
forehead
jem
clasped
her
hands
in
amazement
it
was
flora
herself
as
she
looked
in
the
picture
and
flora
stood
laughing
and
nodding
come
in
she
said
i
thought
it
was
you
but
how
can
i
come
in
through
such
a
little
place
asked
jem
oh
that
is
easy
enough
said
flora
here
give
me
your
hand
jem
did
as
she
told
her
and
found
that
it
was
easy
enough
in
an
instant
she
had
passed
through
the
opening
the
white
brick
had
gone
back
to
its
place
and
she
was
standing
by
flora
side
in
a
large
room
the
nicest
room
she
had
ever
seen
it
was
big
and
lofty
and
light
and
there
were
all
kinds
of
delightful
things
in
it
books
and
flowers
and
playthings
and
pictures
and
in
one
corner
a
great
cage
full
of
lovebirds
have
i
ever
seen
it
before
asked
jem
glancing
slowly
round
yes
said
flora
you
saw
it
last
night
in
your
mind
do
you
remember
it
jem
shook
her
head
i
feel
as
if
i
did
but
why
said
flora
laughing
it
my
room
the
one
you
read
about
last
night
so
it
is
said
jem
but
how
did
you
come
here
i
ca
tell
you
that
i
myself
do
know
but
i
am
here
and
so
rather
mysteriously
are
a
great
many
other
things
are
they
said
jem
very
much
interested
what
things
burned
things
i
was
just
wondering
not
only
burned
things
said
flora
nodding
just
come
with
me
and
i
show
you
something
she
led
the
way
out
of
the
room
and
down
a
little
passage
with
several
doors
in
each
side
of
it
and
she
opened
one
door
and
showed
jem
what
was
on
the
other
side
of
it
that
was
a
room
too
and
this
time
it
was
funny
as
well
as
pretty
both
floor
and
walls
were
padded
with
rose
color
and
the
floor
was
strewn
with
toys
there
were
big
soft
balls
rattles
horses
woolly
dogs
and
a
doll
or
so
there
was
one
low
cushioned
chair
and
a
low
table
you
can
come
in
said
a
shrill
little
voice
behind
the
door
only
mind
you
do
tread
on
things
what
a
funny
little
voice
said
jem
but
she
had
no
sooner
said
it
than
she
jumped
back
the
owner
of
the
voice
who
had
just
come
forward
was
no
other
than
baby
why
exclaimed
jem
beginning
to
feel
frightened
i
left
you
fast
asleep
in
your
crib
did
you
said
baby
somewhat
scornfully
that
just
the
way
with
you
people
you
think
you
know
everything
and
yet
you
discretion
enough
to
know
when
a
pin
is
sticking
into
one
you
know
soon
enough
if
you
had
one
sticking
into
your
own
back
but
i
not
grown
up
stammered
jem
and
when
you
are
at
home
you
can
neither
walk
nor
talk
you
not
six
months
old
well
miss
retorted
baby
whose
wrongs
seemed
to
have
soured
her
disposition
somewhat
you
have
no
need
to
throw
that
in
my
teeth
you
were
not
six
months
old
either
when
you
were
my
age
jem
could
not
help
laughing
you
have
got
any
teeth
she
said
have
i
said
baby
and
she
displayed
two
beautiful
rows
with
some
haughtiness
of
manner
when
i
am
up
here
she
said
i
am
supplied
with
the
modern
conveniences
and
that
why
i
never
complain
do
i
ever
cry
when
i
am
asleep
it
not
falling
asleep
i
object
to
falling
awake
wait
a
minute
said
jem
are
you
asleep
now
i
what
you
call
asleep
i
can
only
come
here
when
i
what
you
call
asleep
asleep
indeed
it
no
wonder
we
always
cry
when
we
have
to
fall
awake
but
we
do
mean
to
be
unkind
to
you
protested
jem
meekly
she
could
not
help
thinking
baby
was
very
severe
do
mean
said
baby
well
why
do
you
think
more
then
how
would
you
like
to
have
all
the
nice
things
snatched
away
from
you
and
all
the
old
rubbish
packed
off
on
you
as
if
you
had
any
sense
how
would
you
like
to
have
to
sit
and
stare
at
things
you
wanted
and
not
to
be
able
to
reach
them
or
if
you
did
reach
them
have
them
fall
out
of
your
hand
and
roll
away
in
the
most
unfeeling
manner
and
then
be
scolded
and
called
it
no
wonder
we
are
bald
you
be
bald
yourself
trouble
and
worry
that
keep
us
bald
until
we
can
begin
to
take
care
of
ourselves
i
had
more
hair
than
this
at
first
but
it
fell
off
as
well
it
might
no
philosopher
ever
thought
of
that
i
suppose
well
said
jem
in
despair
i
hope
you
enjoy
yourself
when
you
are
here
yes
i
do
answered
baby
that
one
comfort
there
is
nothing
to
knock
my
head
against
and
things
have
patent
stoppers
on
them
so
that
they
ca
roll
away
and
everything
is
soft
and
easy
to
pick
up
there
was
a
slight
pause
after
this
and
baby
seemed
to
cool
down
i
suppose
you
would
like
me
to
show
you
round
she
said
not
if
you
have
any
objection
replied
jem
who
was
rather
subdued
i
would
as
soon
do
it
as
not
said
baby
you
are
not
as
bad
as
some
people
though
you
do
get
my
clothes
twisted
when
you
hold
me
upon
the
whole
she
seemed
rather
proud
of
her
position
it
was
evident
she
quite
regarded
herself
as
hostess
she
held
her
small
bald
head
very
high
indeed
as
she
trotted
on
before
them
she
stopped
at
the
first
door
she
came
to
and
knocked
three
times
she
was
obliged
to
stand
upon
tiptoe
to
reach
the
knocker
he
sure
to
be
at
home
at
this
time
of
year
she
remarked
this
is
the
busy
season
who
inquired
jem
but
flora
only
laughed
at
miss
baby
consequential
air
to
be
sure
was
the
answer
as
the
young
lady
pointed
to
the
upon
which
jem
noticed
for
the
first
time
in
very
large
letters
the
door
opened
apparently
without
assistance
and
they
entered
the
apartment
good
gracious
exclaimed
jem
the
next
minute
gracious
she
might
well
be
astonished
it
was
such
a
long
room
that
she
could
not
see
to
the
end
of
it
and
it
was
piled
up
from
floor
to
ceiling
with
toys
of
every
description
and
there
was
such
bustle
and
buzzing
in
it
that
it
was
quite
confusing
the
bustle
and
buzzing
arose
from
a
very
curious
cause
too
it
was
the
bustle
and
buzz
of
hundreds
of
tiny
men
and
women
who
were
working
at
little
tables
no
higher
than
mushrooms
the
pretty
tiny
women
cutting
out
and
sewing
the
pretty
tiny
men
sawing
and
hammering
and
all
talking
at
once
the
principal
person
in
the
place
escaped
jem
notice
at
first
but
it
was
not
long
before
she
saw
him
a
little
old
gentleman
with
a
rosy
face
and
sparkling
eyes
sitting
at
a
desk
and
writing
in
a
book
almost
as
big
as
himself
he
was
so
busy
that
he
was
quite
excited
and
had
been
obliged
to
throw
his
white
fur
coat
and
cap
aside
and
he
was
at
work
in
his
red
waistcoat
look
here
if
you
please
piped
baby
i
have
brought
some
one
to
see
you
when
he
turned
round
jem
recognized
him
at
once
eh
eh
he
said
what
what
who
this
tootsicums
baby
manner
became
very
acid
indeed
i
should
have
thought
you
would
have
said
that
claus
she
remarked
i
ca
help
myself
down
below
but
i
generally
have
my
rights
respected
up
here
i
should
like
to
know
what
sane
godfather
or
godmother
would
give
one
the
name
of
in
one
baptism
they
are
bad
enough
i
must
say
but
i
never
heard
of
any
of
them
calling
a
person
come
come
said
chuckling
comfortably
and
rubbing
his
hands
do
be
too
dignified
it
a
bad
thing
and
do
be
too
fond
of
flourishing
your
rights
in
people
faces
that
the
worst
of
all
miss
midget
folks
who
make
such
a
fuss
about
their
rights
turn
them
into
wrongs
sometimes
then
he
turned
suddenly
to
jem
you
are
the
little
girl
from
down
below
he
said
yes
sir
answered
jem
i
jem
and
this
is
my
friend
flora
out
of
the
blue
book
i
happy
to
make
her
acquaintance
said
and
i
happy
to
make
yours
you
are
a
nice
child
though
a
trifle
peppery
i
very
glad
to
see
you
i
very
glad
indeed
to
see
you
sir
said
jem
i
was
quite
sure
but
there
she
stopped
feeling
that
it
would
be
scarcely
polite
to
tell
him
that
she
had
begun
of
late
years
to
lose
faith
in
him
but
only
chuckled
more
comfortably
than
ever
and
rubbed
his
hands
again
illustration
eh
eh
he
said
what
what
who
this
tootsicums
ho
ho
he
said
you
know
who
i
am
then
jem
hesitated
a
moment
wondering
whether
it
would
not
be
taking
a
liberty
to
mention
his
name
without
putting
before
it
then
she
remembered
what
baby
had
called
him
baby
called
you
claus
sir
she
replied
and
i
have
seen
pictures
of
you
to
be
sure
said
claus
esquire
of
chimneyland
how
do
you
like
me
very
much
answered
jem
very
much
indeed
sir
glad
of
it
glad
of
it
but
what
was
it
you
were
going
to
say
you
were
not
quite
sure
of
jem
blushed
a
little
i
was
not
quite
sure
that
that
you
were
true
sir
at
least
i
have
not
been
quite
sure
since
i
have
been
older
rubbed
the
bald
part
of
his
head
and
gave
a
little
sigh
i
hope
i
have
not
hurt
your
feelings
sir
faltered
jem
who
was
a
very
kind
hearted
little
soul
well
no
said
not
exactly
and
it
is
not
your
fault
either
it
is
natural
i
suppose
at
any
rate
it
is
the
way
of
the
world
people
lose
their
belief
in
a
great
many
things
as
they
grow
older
but
that
does
not
make
the
things
not
true
thank
goodness
and
their
faith
often
comes
back
after
a
while
but
bless
me
he
added
briskly
moralizing
and
who
thanks
a
man
for
doing
that
suppose
black
eyes
or
blue
sir
said
a
tiny
voice
close
to
them
jem
and
flora
turned
round
and
saw
it
was
one
of
the
small
workers
who
was
asking
the
question
whom
for
inquired
little
girl
in
the
red
brick
house
at
the
corner
said
the
workwoman
name
of
birdie
excuse
me
a
moment
said
to
the
children
and
he
turned
to
the
big
book
and
began
to
run
his
fingers
down
the
pages
in
a
manner
ah
here
she
is
he
exclaimed
at
last
blue
eyes
if
you
please
thistle
and
golden
hair
and
let
it
be
a
big
one
she
takes
good
care
of
them
yes
sir
said
thistle
i
am
personally
acquainted
with
several
dolls
in
her
family
i
go
to
parties
in
her
dolls
house
sometimes
when
she
is
fast
asleep
at
night
and
they
all
speak
very
highly
of
her
she
is
most
attentive
to
them
when
they
are
ill
in
fact
her
pet
doll
is
a
cripple
with
a
stiff
leg
she
ran
back
to
her
work
and
finished
his
sentence
suppose
i
show
you
my
establishment
he
said
come
with
me
it
really
would
be
quite
impossible
to
describe
the
wonderful
things
he
showed
them
jem
head
was
quite
in
a
whirl
before
she
had
seen
of
them
and
even
baby
condescended
to
become
excited
there
must
be
a
great
many
children
in
the
world
claus
ventured
jem
yes
yes
millions
of
bless
said
growing
rosier
with
delight
at
the
very
thought
we
never
run
out
of
them
that
one
comfort
there
a
large
and
varied
assortment
always
on
hand
fresh
ones
every
year
too
so
that
when
one
grows
too
old
there
is
a
new
one
ready
i
have
a
place
like
this
in
every
twelfth
chimney
now
it
boys
now
it
girls
always
one
or
and
there
no
end
of
playthings
for
them
too
i
glad
to
say
for
girls
the
great
thing
seems
to
be
dolls
blitzen
what
comfort
they
take
in
dolls
but
the
boys
are
for
horses
and
racket
they
were
standing
near
a
table
where
a
worker
was
just
putting
the
finishing
touch
to
the
dress
of
a
large
wax
doll
and
just
at
that
moment
to
jem
surprise
she
set
it
on
the
floor
upon
its
feet
quite
coolly
thank
you
said
the
doll
politely
jem
quite
jumped
you
can
join
the
rest
now
and
introduce
yourself
said
the
worker
the
doll
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
her
train
it
hangs
very
nicely
she
said
i
hope
it
the
latest
fashion
mine
never
talked
like
that
said
flora
my
best
one
could
only
say
and
it
said
it
very
badly
too
she
was
foolish
for
saying
it
at
all
remarked
the
doll
haughtily
we
do
talk
and
walk
before
ordinary
people
we
keep
our
accomplishments
for
our
own
amusement
and
for
the
amusement
of
our
friends
if
you
should
chance
to
get
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
some
time
or
should
run
into
the
room
suddenly
some
day
after
you
have
left
it
you
might
hear
but
what
is
the
use
of
talking
to
human
beings
you
know
a
great
deal
considering
you
are
only
just
finished
snapped
baby
who
really
was
a
tartar
i
was
finished
retorted
the
doll
i
did
not
begin
life
as
a
baby
very
scornfully
pooh
said
baby
we
improve
as
we
get
older
i
hope
so
indeed
answered
the
doll
there
is
plenty
of
room
for
improvement
and
she
walked
away
in
great
state
looked
at
baby
and
then
shook
his
head
i
shall
not
have
to
take
very
much
care
of
you
he
said
you
are
able
to
take
pretty
good
care
of
yourself
i
hope
i
am
said
baby
tossing
her
head
gave
his
head
another
shake
do
take
too
good
care
of
yourself
he
said
that
a
bad
thing
too
he
showed
them
the
rest
of
his
wonders
and
then
went
with
them
to
the
door
to
bid
them
i
am
sure
we
are
very
much
obliged
to
you
claus
said
jem
gratefully
i
shall
never
again
think
you
are
not
true
sir
patted
her
shoulder
quite
affectionately
that
right
he
said
believe
in
things
just
as
long
as
you
can
my
dear
until
christmas
eve
i
shall
see
you
then
if
you
do
see
me
he
must
have
taken
quite
a
fancy
to
jem
for
he
stood
looking
at
her
and
seemed
very
reluctant
to
close
the
door
and
even
after
he
had
closed
it
and
they
had
turned
away
he
opened
it
a
little
again
to
call
to
her
believe
in
things
as
long
as
you
can
my
dear
how
kind
he
is
exclaimed
jem
full
of
pleasure
baby
shrugged
her
shoulders
well
enough
in
his
way
she
said
but
rather
inclined
to
prose
and
be
jem
looked
at
her
feeling
rather
frightened
but
she
said
nothing
baby
showed
very
little
interest
in
the
next
room
she
took
them
to
i
do
care
about
this
place
she
said
as
she
threw
open
the
door
it
has
nothing
but
old
things
in
it
it
is
the
room
she
had
scarcely
finished
speaking
before
jem
made
a
little
spring
and
picked
something
up
here
my
old
strawberry
pincushion
she
cried
out
and
then
with
another
jump
and
another
dash
at
two
or
three
other
things
and
my
old
and
here
my
little
locket
i
lost
last
summer
how
did
they
come
here
they
went
said
baby
and
this
is
it
but
can
not
i
have
them
again
asked
jem
no
answered
baby
things
that
go
to
stay
there
oh
sighed
jem
i
am
so
sorry
they
are
only
old
things
said
baby
but
i
like
my
old
things
said
jem
i
love
them
and
there
is
needle
case
i
wish
i
might
take
that
her
dead
little
sister
gave
it
to
her
and
she
was
so
sorry
when
she
lost
it
people
ought
to
take
better
care
of
their
things
remarked
baby
jem
would
have
liked
to
stay
in
this
room
and
wander
about
among
her
old
favorites
for
a
long
time
but
baby
was
in
a
hurry
you
better
come
away
she
said
suppose
i
was
to
have
to
fall
awake
and
leave
you
the
next
place
they
went
into
was
the
most
wonderful
of
all
this
is
the
wish
room
said
baby
your
wishes
come
here
yours
and
mother
and
aunt
hetty
and
father
and
mine
when
did
you
wish
that
each
article
was
placed
under
a
glass
shade
and
labelled
with
the
words
and
name
of
the
wishers
some
of
them
were
beautiful
indeed
but
the
tall
shade
baby
nodded
at
when
she
asked
her
question
was
truly
alarming
and
caused
jem
a
dreadful
pang
of
remorse
underneath
it
sat
aunt
hetty
with
her
mouth
stitched
up
so
that
she
could
not
speak
a
word
and
beneath
the
stand
was
a
label
bearing
these
words
in
large
black
letters
i
wish
aunt
hetty
mouth
was
sewed
up
jem
oh
dear
cried
jem
in
great
distress
how
it
must
have
hurt
her
how
unkind
of
me
to
say
it
i
wish
i
had
wished
it
i
wish
it
would
come
undone
she
had
no
sooner
said
it
than
her
wish
was
gratified
the
old
label
disappeared
and
a
new
one
showed
itself
and
there
sat
aunt
hetty
looking
herself
again
and
even
smiling
jem
was
grateful
beyond
measure
but
baby
seemed
to
consider
her
weak
minded
it
served
her
right
she
said
but
when
after
looking
at
the
wishes
at
that
end
of
the
room
they
went
to
the
other
end
her
turn
came
in
one
corner
stood
a
shade
with
a
baby
under
it
and
the
baby
was
miss
baby
herself
but
looking
as
she
very
rarely
looked
in
fact
it
was
the
brightest
best
tempered
baby
one
could
imagine
i
wish
i
had
a
better
tempered
baby
mother
was
written
on
the
label
baby
became
quite
red
in
the
face
with
anger
and
confusion
that
was
here
the
last
time
i
came
she
said
and
it
is
right
down
mean
in
mother
this
was
more
than
jem
could
bear
it
was
mean
she
said
she
could
help
it
you
know
you
are
a
cross
baby
everybody
says
so
baby
turned
two
shades
redder
mind
your
own
business
she
retorted
it
was
mean
and
as
to
that
silly
little
thing
being
better
than
i
am
turning
up
her
small
nose
which
was
quite
turned
up
enough
by
nature
i
must
say
i
do
see
anything
so
very
grand
about
her
so
there
she
scarcely
condescended
to
speak
to
them
while
they
remained
in
the
wish
room
and
when
they
left
it
and
went
to
the
last
door
in
the
passage
she
quite
scowled
at
it
i
do
know
whether
i
shall
open
it
at
all
she
said
why
not
asked
flora
you
might
as
well
it
is
the
lost
pin
room
she
said
i
hate
pins
she
threw
the
door
open
with
a
bang
and
then
stood
and
shook
her
little
fist
viciously
the
room
was
full
of
pins
stacked
solidly
together
there
were
hundreds
of
them
thousands
millions
it
seemed
i
glad
they
lost
she
said
i
wish
there
were
more
of
them
there
i
did
know
there
were
so
many
pins
in
the
world
said
jem
pooh
said
baby
those
are
only
the
lost
ones
that
have
belonged
to
our
family
after
this
they
went
back
to
flora
room
and
sat
down
while
flora
told
jem
the
rest
of
her
story
oh
sighed
jem
when
she
came
to
the
end
how
delightful
it
is
to
be
here
can
i
never
come
again
in
one
way
you
can
said
flora
when
you
want
to
come
just
sit
down
and
be
as
quiet
as
possible
and
shut
your
eyes
and
think
very
hard
about
it
you
can
see
everything
you
have
seen
if
you
try
then
i
shall
be
sure
to
try
jem
answered
she
was
going
to
ask
some
other
question
but
baby
stopped
her
oh
i
falling
awake
she
whimpered
crossly
rubbing
her
eyes
falling
awake
again
and
then
suddenly
a
very
strange
feeling
came
over
jem
flora
and
the
pretty
room
seemed
to
fade
away
and
without
being
able
to
account
for
it
at
all
she
found
herself
sitting
on
her
little
stool
again
with
a
beautiful
scarlet
and
gold
book
on
her
knee
and
her
mother
standing
by
laughing
at
her
amazed
face
as
to
miss
baby
she
was
crying
as
hard
as
she
could
in
her
crib
mother
jem
cried
out
have
you
really
come
home
so
early
as
this
and
and
rubbing
her
eyes
in
great
amazement
how
did
i
come
down
do
i
look
as
if
i
was
real
said
her
mother
laughing
and
kissing
her
and
does
your
present
look
real
i
do
know
how
you
came
down
i
sure
where
have
you
been
jem
shook
her
head
very
mysteriously
she
saw
that
her
mother
fancied
she
had
been
asleep
but
she
herself
knew
better
i
know
you
would
believe
it
was
true
if

told
you
she
said
i
have
been
behind
the
white
brick
