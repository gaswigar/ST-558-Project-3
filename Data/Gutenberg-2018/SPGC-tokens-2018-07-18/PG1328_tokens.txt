b
the
tinker
wedding
a
comedy
in
two
acts
by
synge
john
luce
and
company
boston
copyright
by
synge
preface
the
drama
is
made
serious
in
the
french
sense
of
the
word
not
by
the
degree
in
which
it
is
taken
up
with
problems
that
are
serious
in
themselves
but
by
the
degree
in
which
it
gives
the
nourishment
not
very
easy
to
define
on
which
our
imaginations
live
we
should
not
go
to
the
theatre
as
we
go
to
a
chemist
or
a
but
as
we
go
to
a
dinner
where
the
food
we
need
is
taken
with
pleasure
and
excitement
this
was
nearly
always
so
in
spain
and
england
and
france
when
the
drama
was
at
its
richest
the
infancy
and
decay
of
the
drama
tend
to
be
didactic
but
in
these
days
the
playhouse
is
too
often
stocked
with
the
drugs
of
many
vi
seedy
problems
or
with
the
absinthe
or
mouth
of
the
last
musical
comedy
the
drama
like
the
symphony
does
not
teach
or
prove
anything
analysts
with
their
problems
and
teachers
with
their
systems
are
soon
as
as
the
pharmacop
oelig
ia
of
galen
look
at
ibsen
and
the
germans
but
the
best
plays
of
ben
jonson
and
moli
egrave
re
can
no
more
go
out
of
fashion
than
the
berries
on
the
hedges
of
the
things
which
nourish
the
imagination
humour
is
one
of
the
most
needful
and
it
is
dangerous
to
limit
or
destroy
it
baudelaire
calls
laughter
the
greatest
sign
of
the
satanic
element
in
man
and
where
a
country
loses
its
humor
as
some
towns
in
ireland
are
doing
there
will
be
morbidity
of
mind
as
laire
mind
was
morbid
in
the
greater
part
of
ireland
however
the
whole
people
from
the
tinkers
to
the
clergy
have
still
a
life
and
view
of
life
that
vii
are
rich
and
genial
and
humorous
i
do
not
think
that
these
country
people
who
have
so
much
humor
themselves
will
mind
being
laughed
at
without
malice
as
the
people
in
every
country
have
been
laughed
at
in
their
own
comedies

ning
east

little
coppers
you
have
the
way
i
can
walk
up
in
a
short
while
and
get
another
pint
for
my
sleep
sarah
it
too
much
you
have
taken
let
you
stretch
yourself
out
and
take
a
long
sleep
for
is
that
the
best
thing
any
woman
can
do
and
she
an
old
drinking
heathen
like
yourself
i
she
and
michael
go

mary
i
standing
up

gone
they
are
and
i
with
my
feet
that
weak
under
me
you
knock
me
down
with
a
rush
and
my
head
with
a
noise
in
it
the
like
of
what
you
hear
in
a
stream
and
it
running
between
two
rocks
and
rain
falling
i
she
goes
over
to
the
ditch
where
the
can
is
tied
in
sacking
and
takes
it
down
what
good
am
i
this
night
god
help
me
what
good
are
the
grand
stories
i
have
when
it
few
would
listen
to
an
old
woman
few
but
a
girl
maybe
would
be
in
great
fear
the
time
her
hour
was
come
or
a
little
child
would
be
sleeping
with
the
hunger
on
a
cold
night
i
she
takes
the
can
from
the
sacking
and
fits
in
three
empty
bottles
and
straw
in
its
place
and
ties
them
up
maybe
the
two
of
them
have
a
good
right
to
be
walking
out
the
little
short
while
they
be
young
but
if
they
have
itself
they
not
keep
mary
byrne
from
her
full
pint
when
the
night
fine
and
there
a
dry
moon
in
the
sky
i
she
takes
up
the
can
and
puts
the
package
back
in
the
ditch
jemmy
neill
a
decent
lad
and
he
give
me
a
good
drop
for
the
can
and
maybe
if
i
keep
near
the
peelers
for
the
first
bit
of
the
fair
herself
wo
strike
me
at
all
and
if
she
does
itself
what
a
little
stroke
on
your
head
beside
sitting
lonesome
on
a
fine
night
hearing
the
dogs
barking
and
the
bats
squeaking
and
you
saying
over
it
a
short
while
only
till
you
die
i

godless
talk
mary

curiosity

this
day

thing
and
you
after

up
and
i
having
a
great
sleep
in
the

she
looks
around
cautiously
at

she
has
hidden
the
sarah
i
let
you
stretch
out
again
for
a
sleep
mary

time
yet
before

i
with
that
a
sweet
tongue
you
have
sarah
casey

a
warm
sun
in
it
and
a
kind
air
and
you
hear
the
cuckoos
singing
and
crying
out
on
the
top
of
the
hills
sarah
if
it
that
gay
you
are
have
a
right
to
walk
down
and
see
would
you
get
a
few
halfpence
from
the
rich
men

driving
early
to
the
fair
mary
when
rich
men
do
be
driving

way
it
little
but
bad
words
and
swearing
out

get
from

her
temper
and
breaking
out
then

turn
of
day
mary

rather
uneasy

to
god

our
spirits
michael
there
she
is
again
rousing
cranky
from
the
break
of
dawn
oh
is
she
a
terror
since

moon
did
change
i
she
gets
up
slowly
and
i
best
be
going
forward
to
sell
the
gallon
can
i
she
goes
over
and
takes
up
the
sarah
i
crying
out
leave
that
down
mary
byrne
oh
are
you
the
scorn
of
women
to
think
that
you
have
that
drouth
and
roguery
on
you
that
you
go
drinking
the
can
and
the
dew
not
dried
from
the
grass
mary
i
in
a
feigned
tone
of
pacification
with
the
bundle
still
in
her
it
not
a
drouth
but
a
heartburn
i
have
this
day
sarah
casey
so
i
going
down
to
cool
my
gullet
at
the
blessed
well
and
i
sell
the
can
to
the
parson
daughter
below
a
harmless
poor
creature
would
fill
your
hand
with
shillings
for
a
brace
of
lies
sarah
leave
down
the
tin
can
mary
byrne
for
i
hear
the
drouth
upon
your
tongue
mary
there
not
a
from
this
place
to
the
fair
sarah
casey
the
way
you
find
me
below
with
the
full
price
and
not
a
farthing
gone
i
she
turns
to
go
off
sarah
i
jumping
up
and
picking
up
the
hammer
put
down
that
can
i
saying
mary
i
looking
at
her
for
a
moment
in
terror
and
putting
down
the
bundle
in
the
is
it
raving
mad
you
going
sarah
casey
and
you
the
pride
of
women
to
destroy
the
world
sarah
i
going
up
to
her
and
giving
her
a
push
off
i
show
you
if
it
raving
mad
i
am
go
on
from
this
place
i
saying
and
be
wary
now
mary
i
turning
back
after
if
i
go
i
be
telling
old
and
young
you
a
weathered
heathen
savage
sarah
casey
the
one
did
put
down
a
head
of
the
parson
bage
to
boil
in
the
pot
with
your
clothes
i
the
priest
comes
in
behind
her
on
the
left
and
listens
and
quenched
the
flaming
candles
on
the
throne
of
god
the
time
your
shadow
fell
within
the
pillars
of
the
chapel
door
i
sarah
turns
on
her
and
she
springs
round
nearly
into
the
priest
arms
when
she
sees
him
she
claps
her
shawl
over
her
mouth
and
goes
up
towards
the
ditch
laughing
to
priest
i
going
to
sarah
half
terrified
at
the
language
that
he
has
well
are
you
a
fearful
lot
i
thinking
it
only
humbug
you
were
making
at
the
fall
of
night
and
you
wo
need
me
at
all
sarah
i
with
anger
still
in
her
humbug
is
it
would
you
be
turning
back
upon
your
spoken
promise
in
the
face
of
god
priest
i
i
thinking
you
were
never
christened
sarah
casey
and
it
would
be
a
queer
job
to
go
dealing
christian
sacraments
unto
the
like
of
you
i
ly
feeling
in
his
pocket
so
it
would
be
best
maybe
i
give
you
a
shilling
for

the
like
of
her
for
getting
money
and
selling
songs
to
the
men
mary

you

make
a
woman

a
mind
to
go
sarah
i
let
you
not
be
stroying
us
with
your
talk
when

right
to
a
decent
marriage
as
any
speckled
female
does
be
sleeping
in
the
black
hovels
above
would
choke
a
mule
mary
i
it
as
good
a
right
you
have
surely
sarah
casey
but
what
good
will
it
do
is
it
putting
that
ring
on
your
finger
will
keep
you
from
getting
an
aged
woman
and
losing
the
fine
face
you
have
or
be
easing
your
pains
when
it
the
grand
ladies
do
be
married
in
silk
dresses
with
rings
of
gold
that
do
pass
any
woman
with
their
share
of
torment
in
the
hour
of
birth
and
do
be
paying
the
doctors
in
the
city
of
dublin
a
great
price
at
that
time
the
like
of
what
you
pay
for
a
good
ass
and
a
cart
i
she
sits
sarah
i
is
that
the
truth
mary

pleased
with
the

yet
in
the
world
sarah
casey

it
little
or
nothing
at

maybe
you
know
about
it
sarah
i
vehement
but

of
the
fine
ladies
when
they
would
let
the
like
of

at
all
mary
if
you
do
be
drinking
a
little
sup
in
one
town
and

soon
you
get

knowledge
and
a

on
our
fingers
would
be
cutting
our
skins
maybe
when
we
be
taking
the
ass
from
the
shafts
and
pulling
the
straps
the
time
they
be
slippy
with
going
around
beneath
the
heavens
in
rains
falling
michael
i
who
has
finished
bundling
up
the
things
comes
over
to
fixed
now
and
i
have
a
mind
to
run
him
in
a
boghole
the
way
he
not
be
tattling
to
the
peelers
of
our
games
sarah
you
have
a
right
too
thinking
mary
i
let
you
not
be
rough
with
him
sarah
casey
and
he
after
drinking
his
sup
of
porter
with
us
at
the
fall
of
night
maybe
he
swear
a
mighty
oath
he
would
harm
us
and
then
we
safer
loose
him
for
if
we
went
to
drown
him
they
maybe
hang
the
batch
of
us
man
and
child
and
woman
and
the
ass
itself
michael
what
would
he
care
for
an
oath
mary
do
you
know
his
like
do
live
in
terror
of
the
wrath
of
god
i
putting
her
mouth
to
the
priest
ear
in
the
sacking
would
you
swear
an
oath
holy
father
to
leave
us
in
our
freedom
and
not
talk
at
all
i
priest
nods
in
sacking
did
i
tell
you
look
at
the
poor
fellow
nodding
his
head
off
in
the
bias
of
the
sacks
strip
them
off
from
him
and
he
be
easy
now
michael
i
as
if
speaking
to
a
hold
up
holy
father
i
he
pulls
the
sacking
off
and
shows
the
priest
with
his
hair
on
end
they
free
his
mary
hold
him
till
he
swears
priest
i
in
a
faint
i
swear
surely
if
you
let
me
go
in
peace
i
not
inform
against
you
or
say
a
thing
at
all
and
may
god
forgive
me
for
giving
heed
unto
your
like
sarah
i
puts
the
ring
on
his
there
the
ring
holy
father
to
keep
you
minding
of
your
oath
until
the
end
of
time
for
my
heart
scalded
with
your
fooling
and
it
be
a
long
day
till
i
go
making
talk
of
marriage
or
the
like
of
that
mary
i
complacently
standing
up
i
she
vexed
now
your
reverence
and
let
you
not
mind
her
at
all
for
she
right
surely
and
it
little
need
we
ever
had
of
the
like
of
you
to
get
us
our
bit
to
eat
and
our
bit
to
drink
and
our
time
of
love
when
we
were
young
men
and
women
and
were
fine
to
look
at
michael
hurry
on
now
he
a
great
man
to
have
kept
us
from
fooling
our
gold
and
we
have
a
great
time
drinking
that
bit
with
the
trampers
on
the
green
of
clash
i
they
gather
up
their
things
the
priest
stands
priest
i
lifting
up
his
sworn
not
to
call
the
hand
of
man
upon
your
crimes
but
i
have
sworn
i
call
the
fire
of
heaven
from
the
hand
of
the
almighty
god
i
he
begins
saying
a
latin
malediction
in
a
loud
ecclesiastical
mary
there
an
old
villain
all
i
run
run
run
for
your
lives
i
they
rush
out
leaving
the
priest
master
of
the
curtain
