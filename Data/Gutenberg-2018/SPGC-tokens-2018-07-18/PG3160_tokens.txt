as
much
the
result
of
knowledge
as
knowledge
is
of
scepticism
to
be
content
with
what
we
at
present
know
is
for
the
most
part
to
shut
our
ears
against
conviction
since
from
the
very
gradual
character
of
our
education
we
must
continually
forget
and
emancipate
ourselves
from
knowledge
previously
acquired
we
must
set
aside
old
notions
and
embrace
fresh
ones
and
as
we
learn
we
must
be
daily
unlearning
something
which
it
has
cost
us
no
small
labour
and
anxiety
to
acquire
and
this
difficulty
attaches
itself
more
closely
to
an
age
in
which
progress
has
gained
a
strong
ascendency
over
prejudice
and
in
which
persons
and
things
are
day
by
day
finding
their
real
level
in

of
their
conventional

tawdry

working
as
actively
in

as
in

the
credulity
of
one
writer
or
the
partiality
of
another
finds
as
powerful
a
touchstone
and
as
wholesome
a
chastisement
in
the
healthy
scepticism
of

it
is
by

no

pertinacious
and
exacting
in
its

in

to

we
must
know

human

viewed
under

introduction
of

is
the

to
the
criticism

historical
characters
can
only
be
estimated
by
the
standard
which
human
experience
whether
actual
or
traditionary
has
furnished
to
form
correct
views
of
individuals
we
must
regard
them
as
forming
parts
of
a
great
whole
we
must
measure
them
by
their
relation
to
the
mass
of
beings
by
whom
they
are
surrounded
and
in
contemplating
the
incidents
in
their
lives
or
condition
which
tradition
has
handed
down
to
us
we
must
rather
consider
the
general
bearing
of
the
whole
narrative
than
the
respective
probability
of
its
details
it
is
unfortunate
for
us
that
of
some
of
the
greatest
men
we
know
least
and
talk
most
homer
socrates
and
shakespere
have
perhaps
contributed
more
to
the
intellectual
enlightenment
of
mankind
than
any
other
three
writers
who
could
be
named
and
yet
the
history
of
all
three
has
given
rise
to
a
boundless
ocean
of
discussion
which
has
left
us
little
save
the
option
of
choosing
which
theory
or
theories
we
will
follow
the
personality
of
shakespere
is
perhaps
the
only
thing
in
which
critics
will
allow
us
to
believe
without
controversy
but
upon
everything
else
even
down
to
the
authorship
of
plays
there
is
more
or
less
of
doubt
and
uncertainty
of
socrates
we
know
as
little
as
the
contradictions
of
plato
and
xenophon
will
allow
us
to
know
he
was
one
of
the
dramatis
personae
in
two
dramas
as
unlike
in
principles
as
in
style
he
appears
as
the
enunciator
of
opinions
as
different
in
their
tone
as
those
of
the
writers
who
have
handed
them
down
when
we
have
read
plato
or
xenophon
we
think
we
know
something
of
socrates
when
we
have
fairly
read
and
examined
both
we
feel
convinced
that
we
are
something
worse
than
ignorant
it
has
been
an
easy
and
a
popular
expedient
of
late
years
to
deny
the
personal
or
real
existence
of
men
and
things
whose
life
and
condition
were
too
much
for
our
belief
this
system
which
has
often
comforted
the
religious
sceptic
and
substituted
the
consolations
of
strauss
for
those
of
the
new
testament
has
been
of
incalculable
value
to
the
historical
theorists
of
the
last
and
present
centuries
to
question
the
existence
of
alexander
the
great
would
be
a
more
excusable
act
than
to
believe
in
that
of
romulus
to
deny
a
fact
related
in
herodotus
because
it
is
inconsistent
with
a
theory
developed
from
an
assyrian
inscription
which
no
two
scholars
read
in
the
same
way
is
more
pardonable
than
to
believe
in
the
old
king
whom
the
elegant
pen
of
florian
has
idealized
numa
pompilius
scepticism
has
attained
its
culminating
point
with
respect
to
homer
and
the
state
of
our
homeric
knowledge
may
be
described
as
a
free
permission
to
believe
any
theory
provided
we
throw
overboard
all
written
tradition
concerning
the
author
or
authors
of
the
iliad
and
odyssey
what
few
authorities
exist
on
the
subject
are
summarily
dismissed
although
the
arguments
appear
to
run
in
a
circle
this
can
not
be
true
because
it
is
not
true
and
that
is
not
true
because
it
can
not
be
true
such
seems
to
be
the
style
in
which
testimony
upon
testimony
statement
upon
statement
is
consigned
to
denial
and
oblivion
it
is
however
unfortunate
that
the
professed
biographies
of
homer
are
partly
forgeries
partly
freaks
of
ingenuity
and
imagination
in
which
truth
is
the
requisite
most
wanting
before
taking
a
brief
review
of
the
homeric
theory
in
its
present
conditions
some
notice
must
be
taken
of
the
treatise
on
the
life
of
homer
which
has
been
attributed
to
herodotus
according
to
this
document
the
city
of
cumae
in
aeolia
was
at
an
early
period
the
seat
of
frequent
immigrations
from
various
parts
of
greece
among
the
immigrants
was
menapolus
the
son
of
ithagenes
although
poor
he
married
and
the
result
of
the
union
was
a
girl
named
critheis
the
girl
was
left
an
orphan
at
an
early
age
under
the
guardianship
of
cleanax
of
argos
it
is
to
the
indiscretion
of
this
maiden
that
we
are
indebted
for
so
much
happiness
homer
was
the
first
fruit
of
her
juvenile
frailty
and
received
the
name
of
melesigenes
from
having
been
born
near
the
river
meles
in
boeotia
whither
critheis
had
been
transported
in
order
to
save
her
reputation
at
this
time
continues
our
narrative
there
lived
at
smyrna
a
man
named
phemius
a
teacher
of
literature
and
music
who
not
being
married
engaged
critheis
to
manage
his
household
and
spin
the
flax
he
received
as
the
price
of
his
scholastic
labours
so
satisfactory
was
her
performance
of
this
task
and
so
modest
her
conduct
that
he
made
proposals
of
marriage
declaring
himself
as
a
further
inducement
willing
to
adopt
her
son
who
he
asserted
would
become
a
clever
man
if
he
were
carefully
brought
up
they
were
married
careful
cultivation
ripened
the
talents
which
nature
had
bestowed
and
melesigenes
soon
surpassed
his
schoolfellows
in
every
attainment
and
when
older
rivalled
his
preceptor
in
wisdom
phemius
died
leaving
him
sole
heir
to
his
property
and
his
mother
soon
followed
melesigenes
carried
on
his
adopted
school
with
great
success
exciting
the
admiration
not
only
of
the
inhabitants
of
smyrna
but
also
of
the
strangers
whom
the
trade
carried
on
there
especially
in
the
exportation
of
corn
attracted
to
that
city
among
these
visitors
one
mentes
from
leucadia
the
modern
santa
maura
who
evinced
a
knowledge
and
intelligence
rarely
found
in
those
times
persuaded
melesigenes
to
close
his
school
and
accompany
him
on
his
travels
he
promised
not
only
to
pay
his
expenses
but
to
furnish
him
with
a
further
stipend
urging
that
while
he
was
yet
young
it
was
fitting
that
he
should
see
with
his
own
eyes
the
countries
and
cities
which
might
hereafter
be
the
subjects
of
his
discourses
melesigenes
consented
and
set
out
with
his
patron
examining
all
the
curiosities
of
the
countries
they
visited
and
informing
himself
of
everything
by
interrogating
those
whom
he
met
we
may
also
suppose
that
he
wrote
memoirs
of
all
that
he
deemed
worthy
of
preservation
having
set
sail
from
tyrrhenia
and
iberia
they
reached
ithaca
here
melesigenes
who
had
already
suffered
in
his
eyes
became
much
worse
and
mentes
who
was
about
to
leave
for
leucadia
left
him
to
the
medical
superintendence
of
a
friend
of
his
named
mentor
the
son
of
alcinor
under
his
hospitable
and
intelligent
host
melesigenes
rapidly
became
acquainted
with
the
legends
respecting
ulysses
which
afterwards
formed
the
subject
of
the
odyssey
the
inhabitants
of
ithaca
assert
that
it
was
here
that
melesigenes
became
blind
but
the
colophonians
make
their
city
the
seat
of
that
misfortune
he
then
returned
to
smyrna
where
he
applied
himself
to
the
study
of
poetry
but
poverty
soon
drove
him
to
cumae
having
passed
over
the
hermaean
plain
he
arrived
at
neon
teichos
the
new
wall
a
colony
of
cumae
here
his
misfortunes
and
poetical
talent
gained
him
the
friendship
of
one
tychias
an
armourer
and
up
to
my
time
continues
the
author
the
inhabitants
showed
the
place
where
he
used
to
sit
when
giving
a
recitation
of
his
verses
and
they
greatly
honoured
the
spot
here
also
a
poplar
grew
which
they
said
had
sprung
up
ever
since
melesigenes
arrived
but
poverty
still
drove
him
on
and
he
went
by
way
of
larissa
as
being
the
most
convenient
road
here
the
cumans
say
he
composed
an
epitaph
on
gordius
king
of
phrygia
which
has
however
and
with
greater
probability
been
attributed
to
cleobulus
of
lindus
arrived
at
cumae
he
frequented
the
conversaziones
of
the
old
men
and
delighted
all
by
the
charms
of
his
poetry
encouraged
by
this
favourable
reception
he
declared
that
if
they
would
allow
him
a
public
maintenance
he
would
render
their
city
most
gloriously
renowned
they
avowed
their
willingness
to
support
him
in
the
measure
he
proposed
and
procured
him
an
audience
in
the
council
having
made
the
speech
with
the
purport
of
which
our
author
has
forgotten
to
acquaint
us
he
retired
and
left
them
to
debate
respecting
the
answer
to
be
given
to
his
proposal
the
greater
part
of
the
assembly
seemed
favourable
to
the
demand
but
one
man
observed
that
if
they
were
to
feed
homers
they
would
be
encumbered
with
a
multitude
of
useless
people
from
this
circumstance
says
the
writer
melesigenes
acquired
the
name
of
homer
for
the
cumans
call
blind
men
homers
with
a
love
of
economy
which
shows
how
similar
the
world
has
always
been
in
its
treatment
of
literary
men
the
pension
was
denied
and
the
poet
vented
his
disappointment
in
a
wish
that
cumae
might
never
produce
a
poet
capable
of
giving
it
renown
and
glory
at
phocaea
homer
was
destined
to
experience
another
literary
distress
one
thestorides
who
aimed
at
the
reputation
of
poetical
genius
kept
homer
in
his
own
house
and
allowed
him
a
pittance
on
condition
of
the
verses
of
the
poet
passing
in
his
name
having
collected
sufficient
poetry
to
be
profitable
thestorides
like
some
literary
publishers
neglected
the
man
whose
brains
he
had
sucked
and
left
him
at
his
departure
homer
is
said
to
have
observed
o
thestorides
of
the
many
things
hidden
from
the
knowledge
of
man
nothing
is
more
unintelligible
than
the
human
heart
homer
continued
his
career
of
difficulty
and
distress
until
some
chian
merchants
struck
by
the
similarity
of
the
verses
they
heard
him
recite
acquainted
him
with
the
fact
that
thestorides
was
pursuing
a
profitable
livelihood
by
the
recital
of
the
very
same
poems
this
at
once
determined
him
to
set
out
for
chios
no
vessel
happened
then
to
be
setting
sail
thither
but
he
found
one
ready
to
start
for
erythrae
a
town
of
ionia
which
faces
that
island
and
he
prevailed
upon
the
seamen
to
allow
him
to
accompany
them
having
embarked
he
invoked
a
favourable
wind
and
prayed
that
he
might
be
able
to
expose
the
imposture
of
thestorides
who
by
his
breach
of
hospitality
had
drawn
down
the
wrath
of
jove
the
hospitable
at
erythrae
homer
fortunately
met
with
a
person
who
had
known
him
in
phocaea
by
whose
assistance
he
at
length
after
some
difficulty
reached
the
little
hamlet
of
pithys
here
he
met
with
an
adventure
which
we
will
continue
in
the
words
of
our
author
having
set
out
from
pithys
homer
went
on
attracted
by
the
cries
of
some
goats
that
were
pasturing
the
dogs
barked
on
his
approach
and
he
cried
out
glaucus
for
that
was
the
name
of
the
heard
his
voice
ran
up
quickly
called
off
his
dogs
and
drove
them
away
from
homer
for
some
time
he
stood
wondering
how
a
blind
man
should
have
reached
such
a
place
alone
and
what
could
be
his
design
in
coming
he
then
went
up
to
him
and
inquired
who
he
was
and
how
he
had
come
to
desolate
places
and
untrodden
spots
and
of
what
he
stood
in
need
homer
by
recounting
to
him
the
whole
history
of
his
misfortunes
moved
him
with
compassion
and
he
took
him
and
led
him
to
his
cot
and
having
lit
a
fire
bade
him
sup
the
dogs
instead
of
eating
kept
barking
at
the
stranger
according
to
their
usual
habit
whereupon
homer
addressed
glaucus
thus
o
glaucus
my
friend
prythee
attend
to
my
behest
first
give
the
dogs
their
supper
at
the
doors
of
the
hut
for
so
it
is
better
since
whilst
they
watch
nor
thief
nor
wild
beast
will
approach
the
fold
glaucus
was
pleased
with
the
advice
and
marvelled
at
its
author
having
finished
supper
they
banqueted
afresh
on
conversation
homer
narrating
his
wanderings
and
telling
of
the
cities
he
had
visited
at
length
they
retired
to
rest
but
on
the
following
morning
glaucus
resolved
to
go
to
his
master
and
acquaint
him
with
his
meeting
with
homer
having
left
the
goats
in
charge
of
a
he
left
homer
at
home
promising
to
return
quickly
having
arrived
at
bolissus
a
place
near
the
farm
and
finding
his
mate
he
told
him
the
whole
story
respecting
homer
and
his
journey
he
paid
little
attention
to
what
he
said
and
blamed
glaucus
for
his
stupidity
in
taking
in
and
feeding
maimed
and
enfeebled
persons
however
he
bade
him
bring
the
stranger
to
him
glaucus
told
homer
what
had
taken
place
and
bade
him
follow
him
assuring
him
that
good
fortune
would
be
the
result
conversation
soon
showed
that
the
stranger
was
a
man
of
much
cleverness
and
general
knowledge
and
the
chian
persuaded
him
to
remain
and
to
undertake
the
charge
of
his
children
besides
the
satisfaction
of
driving
the
impostor
thestorides
from
the
island
homer
enjoyed
considerable
success
as
a
teacher
in
the
town
of
chios
he
established
a
school
where
he
taught
the
precepts
of
poetry
to
this
day
says
chandler
the
most
curious
remain
is
that
which
has
been
named
without
reason
the
school
of
homer
it
is
on
the
coast
at
some
distance
from
the
city
northward
and
appears
to
have
been
an
open
temple
of
cybele
formed
on
the
top
of
a
rock
the
shape
is
oval
and
in
the
centre
is
the
image
of
the
goddess
the
head
and
an
arm
wanting
she
is
represented
as
usual
sitting
the
chair
has
a
lion
carved
on
each
side
and
on
the
back
the
area
is
bounded
by
a
low
rim
or
seat
and
about
five
yards
over
the
whole
is
hewn
out
of
the
mountain
is
rude
indistinct
and
probably
of
the
most
remote
antiquity
so
successful
was
this
school
that
homer
realised
a
considerable
fortune
he
married
and
had
two
daughters
one
of
whom
died
single
the
other
married
a
chian
the
following
passage
betrays
the
same
tendency
to
connect
the
personages
of
the
poems
with
the
history
of
the
poet
which
has
already
been
mentioned
in
his
poetical
compositions
homer
displays
great
gratitude
towards
mentor
of
ithaca
in
the
odyssey
whose
name
he
has
inserted
in
his
poem
as
the
companion
of
ulysses
in

for
the
care
taken
of
him
when
afflicted
with
blindness
he
also
testifies
his
gratitude
to
phemius
who
had
given
him
both
sustenance
and
instruction
his
celebrity
continued
to
increase
and
many
persons
advised
him
to
visit
greece
whither
his
reputation
had
now
extended
having
it
is
said
made
some
additions
to
his
poems
calculated
to
please
the
vanity
of
the
athenians
of
whose
city
he
had
hitherto
made
no
mention
he
set
out
for
samos
here
being
recognized
by
a
samian
who
had
met
with
him
in
chios
he
was
handsomely
received
and
invited
to
join
in
celebrating
the
apaturian
festival
he
recited
some
verses
which
gave
great
satisfaction
and
by
singing
the
eiresione
at
the
new
moon
festivals
he
earned
a
subsistence
visiting
the
houses
of
the
rich
with
whose
children
he
was
very
popular
in
the
spring
he
sailed
for
athens
and
arrived
at
the
island
of
ios
now
ino
where
he
fell
extremely
ill
and
died
it
is
said
that
his
death
arose
from
vexation
at
not
having
been
able
to
unravel
an
enigma
proposed
by
some
fishermen
children
such
is
in
brief
the
substance
of
the
earliest
life
of
homer
we
possess
and
so
broad
are
the
evidences
of
its
historical
worthlessness
that
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
point
them
out
in
detail
let
us
now
consider
some
of
the
opinions
to
which
a
persevering
patient
and
learned
but
by
no
means
consistent
series
of
investigations
has
led
in
doing
so
i
profess
to
bring
forward
statements
not
to
vouch
for
their
reasonableness
or
probability
homer
appeared
the
history
of
this
poet
and
his
works
is
lost
in
doubtful
obscurity
as
is
the
history
of
many
of
the
first
minds
who
have
done
honour
to
humanity
because
they
rose
amidst
darkness
the
majestic
stream
of
his
song
blessing
and
fertilizing
flows
like
the
nile
through
many
lands
and
nations
and
like
the
sources
of
the
nile
its
fountains
will
ever
remain
concealed
such
are
the
words
in
which
one
of
the
most
judicious
german
critics
has
eloquently
described
the
uncertainty
in
which
the
whole
of
the
homeric
question
is
involved
with
no
less
truth
and
feeling
he
proceeds
it
seems
here
of
chief
importance
to
expect
no
more
than
the
nature
of
things
makes
possible
if
the
period
of
tradition
in
history
is
the
region
of
twilight
we
should
not
expect
in
it
perfect
light
the
creations
of
genius
always
seem
like
miracles
because
they
are
for
the
most
part
created
far
out
of
the
reach
of
observation
if
we
were
in
possession
of
all
the
historical
testimonies
we
never
could
wholly
explain
the
origin
of
the
iliad
and
the
odyssey
for
their
origin
in
all
essential
points
must
have
remained
the
secret
of
the
poet
from
this
criticism
which
shows
as
much
insight
into
the
depths
of
human
nature
as
into
the
minute
of
scholastic
investigation
let
us
pass
on
to
the
main
question
at
issue
was
homer
an
individual
or
were
the
iliad
and
odyssey
the
result
of
an
ingenious
arrangement
of
fragments
by
earlier
poets
well
has
landor
remarked
some
tell
us
there
were
twenty
homers
some
deny
that
there
was
ever
one
it
were
idle
and
foolish
to
shake
the
contents
of
a
vase
in
order
to
let
them
settle
at
last
we
are
perpetually
labouring
to
destroy
our
delights
our
composure
our
devotion
to
superior
power
of
all
the
animals
on
earth
we
least
know
what
is
good
for
us
my
opinion
is
that
what
is
best
for
us
is
our
admiration
of
good
no
man
living
venerates
homer
more
than
i
do
but
greatly
as
we
admire
the
generous
enthusiasm
which
rests
contented
with
the
poetry
on
which
its
best
impulses
had
been
nurtured
and
fostered
without
seeking
to
destroy
the
vividness
of
first
impressions
by
minute
analysis
our
editorial
office
compels
us
to
give
some
attention
to
the
doubts
and
difficulties
with
which
the
homeric
question
is
beset
and
to
entreat
our
reader
for
a
brief
period
to
prefer
his
judgment
to
his
imagination
and
to
condescend
to
dry
details
before
however
entering
into
particulars
respecting
the
question
of
this
unity
of
the
homeric
poems
at
least
of
the
iliad
i
must
express
my
sympathy
with
the
sentiments
expressed
in
the
following
remarks
we
can
not
but
think
the
universal
admiration
of
its
unity
by
the
better
the
poetic
age
of
greece
almost
conclusive
testimony
to
its
original
composition
it
was
not
till
the
age
of
the
grammarians
that
its
primitive
integrity
was
called
in
question
nor
is
it
injustice
to
assert
that
the
minute
and
analytical
spirit
of
a
grammarian
is
not
the
best
qualification
for
the
profound
feeling
the
comprehensive
conception
of
an
harmonious
whole
the
most
exquisite
anatomist
may
be
no
judge
of
the
symmetry
of
the
human
frame
and
we
would
take
the
opinion
of
chantrey
or
westmacott
on
the
proportions
and
general
beauty
of
a
form
rather
than
that
of
brodie
or
sir
astley
cooper
there
is
some
truth
though
some
malicious
exaggeration
in
the
lines
of
pope
critic
eye
that
microscope
of
wit
sees
hairs
and
pores
examines
bit
by
bit
how
parts
relate
to
parts
or
they
to
whole
the
body
harmony
the
beaming
soul
are
things
which
kuster
burmann
wasse
shall
see
when
man
whole
frame
is
obvious
to
a
flea
long
was
the
time
which
elapsed
before
any
one
dreamt
of
questioning
the
unity
of
the
authorship
of
the
homeric
poems
the
grave
and
cautious
thucydides
quoted
without
hesitation
the
hymn
to
apollo
the
authenticity
of
which
has
been
already
disclaimed
by
modern
critics
longinus
in
an
passage
merely
expressed
an
opinion
touching
the
comparative
inferiority
of
the
odyssey
to
the
iliad
and
among
a
mass
of
ancient
authors
whose
very
names
it
would
be
tedious
to
detail
no
suspicion
of
the
personal
of
homer
ever
arose
so
far
the
voice
of
antiquity
seems
to
be
in
favour
of
our
early
ideas
on
the
subject
let
us
now
see
what
are
the
discoveries
to
which
more
modern
investigations
lay
claim
at
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
doubts
had
begun
to
awaken
on
the
subject
and
we
find
bentley
remarking
that
homer
wrote
a
sequel
of
songs
and
rhapsodies
to
be
sung
by
himself
for
small
comings
and
good
cheer
at
festivals
and
other
days
of
merriment
these
loose
songs
were
not
collected
together
in
the
form
of
an
epic
poem
till
about
peisistratus
time
about
five
hundred
years
after
two
french
writers
hedelin
and
perrault
avowed
a
similar
scepticism
on
the
subject
but
it
is
in
the
scienza
nuova
of
battista
vico
that
we
first
meet
with
the
germ
of
the
theory
subsequently
defended
by
wolf
with
so
much
learning
and
acuteness
indeed
it
is
with
the
wolfian
theory
that
we
have
chiefly
to
deal
and
with
the
following
bold
hypothesis
which
we
will
detail
in
the
words
of
grote
half
a
century
ago
the
acute
and
valuable
prolegomena
of
wolf
turning
to
account
the
venetian
scholia
which
had
then
been
recently
published
first
opened
philosophical
discussion
as
to
the
history
of
the
homeric
text
a
considerable
part
of
that
dissertation
though
by
no
means
the
whole
is
employed
in
vindicating
the
position
previously
announced
by
bentley
amongst
others
that
the
separate
constituent
portions
of
the
iliad
and
odyssey
had
not
been
cemented
together
into
any
compact
body
and
unchangeable
order
until
the
days
of
peisistratus
in
the
sixth
century
before
christ
as
a
step
towards
that
conclusion
wolf
maintained
that
no
written
copies
of
either
poem
could
be
shown
to
have
existed
during
the
earlier
times
to
which
their
composition
is
referred
and
that
without
writing
neither
the
perfect
symmetry
of
so
complicated
a
work
could
have
been
originally
conceived
by
any
poet
nor
if
realized
by
him
transmitted
with
assurance
to
posterity
the
absence
of
easy
and
convenient
writing
such
as
must
be
indispensably
supposed
for
long
manuscripts
among
the
early
greeks
was
thus
one
of
the
points
in
wolf
case
against
the
primitive
integrity
of
the
iliad
and
odyssey
by
nitzsch
and
other
leading
opponents
of
wolf
the
connection
of
the
one
with
the
other
seems
to
have
been
accepted
as
he
originally
put
it
and
it
has
been
considered
incumbent
on
those
who
defended
the
ancient
aggregate
character
of
the
iliad
and
odyssey
to
maintain
that
they
were
written
poems
from
the
beginning
to
me
it
appears
that
the
architectonic
functions
ascribed
by
wolf
to
peisistratus
and
his
associates
in
reference
to
the
homeric
poems
are
nowise
admissible
but
much
would
undoubtedly
be
gained
towards
that
view
of
the
question
if
it
could
be
shown
that
in
order
to
controvert
it
we
were
driven
to
the
necessity
of
admitting
long
written
poems
in
the
ninth
century
before
the
christian
aera
few
things
in
my
opinion
can
be
more
improbable
and
payne
knight
opposed
as
he
is
to
the
wolfian
hypothesis
admits
this
no
less
than
wolf
himself
the
traces
of
writing
in
greece
even
in
the
seventh
century
before
the
christian
aera
are
exceedingly
trifling
we
have
no
remaining
inscription
earlier
than
the
fortieth
olympiad
and
the
early
inscriptions
are
rude
and
unskilfully
executed
nor
can
we
even
assure
ourselves
whether
archilochus
simonides
of
amorgus
kallinus
tyrtaeus
xanthus
and
the
other
early
elegiac
and
lyric
poets
committed
their
compositions
to
writing
or
at
what
time
the
practice
of
doing
so
became
familiar
the
first
positive
ground
which
authorizes
us
to
presume
the
existence
of
a
manuscript
of
homer
is
in
the
famous
ordinance
of
solon
with
regard
to
the
rhapsodies
at
the
panathenaea
but
for
what
length
of
time
previously
manuscripts
had
existed
we
are
unable
to
say
those
who
maintain
the
homeric
poems
to
have
been
written
from
the
beginning
rest
their
case
not
upon
positive
proofs
nor
yet
upon
the
existing
habits
of
society
with
regard
to
poetry
for
they
admit
generally
that
the
iliad
and
odyssey
were
not
read
but
recited
and
heard
but
upon
the
supposed
necessity
that
there
must
have
been
manuscripts
to
ensure
the
preservation
of
the
poems
the
unassisted
memory
of
reciters
being
neither
sufficient
nor
trustworthy
but
here
we
only
escape
a
smaller
difficulty
by
running
into
a
greater
for
the
existence
of
trained
bards
gifted
with
extraordinary
memory
is
far
less
astonishing
than
that
of
long
manuscripts
in
an
age
essentially
and
and
when
even
suitable
instruments
and
materials
for
the
process
are
not
obvious
moreover
there
is
a
strong
positive
reason
for
believing
that
the
bard
was
under
no
necessity
of
refreshing
his
memory
by
consulting
a
manuscript
for
if
such
had
been
the
fact
blindness
would
have
been
a
disqualification
for
the
profession
which
we
know
that
it
was
not
as
well
from
the
example
of
demodokus
in
the
odyssey
as
from
that
of
the
blind
bard
of
chios
in
the
hymn
to
the
delian
apollo
whom
thucydides
as
well
as
the
general
tenor
of
grecian
legend
identifies
with
homer
himself
the
author
of
that
hymn
be
he
who
he
may
could
never
have
described
a
blind
man
as
attaining
the
utmost
perfection
in
his
art
if
he
had
been
conscious
that
the
memory
of
the
bard
was
only
maintained
by
constant
reference
to
the
manuscript
in
his
chest
the
loss
of
the
digamma
that
crux
of
critics
that
quicksand
upon
which
even
the
acumen
of
bentley
was
shipwrecked
seems
to
prove
beyond
a
doubt
that
the
pronunciation
of
the
greek
language
had
undergone
a
considerable
change
now
it
is
certainly
difficult
to
suppose
that
the
homeric
poems
could
have
suffered
by
this
change
had
written
copies
been
preserved
if
chaucer
poetry
for
instance
had
not
been
written
it
could
only
have
come
down
to
us
in
a
softened
form
more
like
the
effeminate
version
of
dryden
than
the
rough
quaint
noble
original
at
what
period
continues
grote
these
poems
or
indeed
any
other
greek
poems
first
began
to
be
written
must
be
matter
of
conjecture
though
there
is
ground
for
assurance
that
it
was
before
the
time
of
solon
if
in
the
absence
of
evidence
we
may
venture
upon
naming
any
more
determinate
period
the
question
at
once
suggests
itself
what
were
the
purposes
which
in
that
state
of
society
a
manuscript
at
its
first
commencement
must
have
been
intended
to
answer
for
whom
was
a
written
iliad
necessary
not
for
the
rhapsodes
for
with
them
it
was
not
only
planted
in
the
memory
but
also
interwoven
with
the
feelings
and
conceived
in
conjunction
with
all
those
flexions
and
intonations
of
voice
pauses
and
other
oral
artifices
which
were
required
for
emphatic
delivery
and
which
the
naked
manuscript
could
never
reproduce
not
for
the
general
public
they
were
accustomed
to
receive
it
with
its
rhapsodic
delivery
and
with
its
accompaniments
of
a
solemn
and
crowded
festival
the
only
persons
for
whom
the
written
iliad
would
be
suitable
would
be
a
select
few
studious
and
curious
men
a
class
of
readers
capable
of
analyzing
the
complicated
emotions
which
they
had
experienced
as
hearers
in
the
crowd
and
who
would
on
perusing
the
written
words
realize
in
their
imaginations
a
sensible
portion
of
the
impression
communicated
by
the
reciter
incredible
as
the
statement
may
seem
in
an
age
like
the
present
there
is
in
all
early
societies
and
there
was
in
early
greece
a
time
when
no
such
reading
class
existed
if
we
could
discover
at
what
time
such
a
class
first
began
to
be
formed
we
should
be
able
to
make
a
guess
at
the
time
when
the
old
epic
poems
were
first
committed
to
writing
now
the
period
which
may
with
the
greatest
probability
be
fixed
upon
as
having
first
witnessed
the
formation
even
of
the
narrowest
reading
class
in
greece
is
the
middle
of
the
seventh
century
before
the
christian
aera
to
the
age
of
terpander
kallinus
archilochus
simenides
of
amorgus
i
ground
this
supposition
on
the
change
then
operated
in
the
character
and
tendencies
of
grecian
poetry
and
music
the
elegiac
and
the
iambic
measures
having
been
introduced
as
rivals
to
the
primitive
hexameter
and
poetical
compositions
having
been
transferred
from
the
epical
past
to
the
affairs
of
present
and
real
life
such
a
change
was
important
at
a
time
when
poetry
was
the
only
known
mode
of
publication
to
use
a
modern
phrase
not
altogether
suitable
yet
the
nearest
approaching
to
the
sense
it
argued
a
new
way
of
looking
at
the
old
epical
treasures
of
the
people
as
well
as
a
thirst
for
new
poetical
effect
and
the
men
who
stood
forward
in
it
may
well
be
considered
as
desirous
to
study
and
competent
to
criticize
from
their
own
individual
point
of
view
the
written
words
of
the
homeric
rhapsodies
just
as
we
are
told
that
kallinus
both
noticed
and
eulogized
the
thebais
as
the
production
of
homer
there
seems
therefore
ground
for
conjecturing
that
for
the
use
of
this
and
important
but
very
narrow
class
manuscripts
of
the
homeric
poems
and
other
old
epics
the
thebais
and
the
cypria
as
well
as
the
iliad
and
the
odyssey
began
to
be
compiled
towards
the
middle
of
the
seventh
century
i
and
the
opening
of
egypt
to
grecian
commerce
which
took
place
about
the
same
period
would
furnish
increased
facilities
for
obtaining
the
requisite
papyrus
to
write
upon
a
reading
class
when
once
formed
would
doubtless
slowly
increase
and
the
number
of
manuscripts
along
with
it
so
that
before
the
time
of
solon
fifty
years
afterwards
both
readers
and
manuscripts
though
still
comparatively
few
might
have
attained
a
certain
recognized
authority
and
formed
a
tribunal
of
reference
against
the
carelessness
of
individual
rhapsodies
but
even
peisistratus
has
not
been
suffered
to
remain
in
possession
of
the
credit
and
we
can
not
help
feeling
the
force
of
the
following
observations
there
are
several
incidental
circumstances
which
in
our
opinion
throw
some
suspicion
over
the
whole
history
of
the
peisistratid
compilation
at
least
over
the
theory
that
the
iliad
was
cast
into
its
present
stately
and
harmonious
form
by
the
directions
of
the
athenian
ruler
if
the
great
poets
who
flourished
at
the
bright
period
of
grecian
song
of
which
alas
we
have
inherited
little
more
than
the
fame
and
the
faint
echo
if
stesichorus
anacreon
and
simonides
were
employed
in
the
noble
task
of
compiling
the
iliad
and
odyssey
so
much
must
have
been
done
to
arrange
to
connect
to
harmonize
that
it
is
almost
incredible
that
stronger
marks
of
athenian
manufacture
should
not
remain
whatever
occasional
anomalies
may
be
detected
anomalies
which
no
doubt
arise
out
of
our
own
ignorance
of
the
language
of
the
homeric
age
however
the
irregular
use
of
the
digamma
may
have
perplexed
our
bentleys
to
whom
the
name
of
helen
is
said
to
have
caused
as
much
disquiet
and
distress
as
the
fair
one
herself
among
the
heroes
of
her
age
however
knight
may
have
failed
in
reducing
the
homeric
language
to
its
primitive
form
however
finally
the
attic
dialect
may
not
have
assumed
all
its
more
marked
and
distinguishing
characteristics
still
it
is
difficult
to
suppose
that
the
language
particularly
in
the
joinings
and
transitions
and
connecting
parts
should
not
more
clearly
betray
the
incongruity
between
the
more
ancient
and
modern
forms
of
expression
it
is
not
quite
in
character
with
such
a
period
to
imitate
an
antique
style
in
order
to
piece
out
an
imperfect
poem
in
the
character
of
the
original
as
sir
walter
scott
has
done
in
his
continuation
of
sir
tristram
if
however
not
even
such
faint
and
indistinct
traces
of
athenian
compilation
are
discoverable
in
the
language
of
the
poems
the
total
absence
of
athenian
national
feeling
is
perhaps
no
less
worthy
of
observation
in
later
and
it
may
fairly
be
suspected
in
earlier
times
the
athenians
were
more
than
ordinarily
jealous
of
the
fame
of
their
ancestors
but
amid
all
the
traditions
of
the
glories
of
early
greece
embodied
in
the
iliad
the
athenians
play
a
most
subordinate
and
insignificant
part
even
the
few
passages
which
relate
to
their
ancestors
knight
suspects
to
be
interpolations
it
is
possible
indeed
that
in
its
leading
outline
the
iliad
may
be
true
to
historic
fact
that
in
the
great
maritime
expedition
of
western
greece
against
the
rival
and
empire
of
the
laomedontiadae
the
chieftain
of
thessaly
from
his
valour
and
the
number
of
his
forces
may
have
been
the
most
important
ally
of
the
peloponnesian
sovereign
the
value
of
the
ancient
poetry
on
the
trojan
war
may
thus
have
forced
the
national
feeling
of
the
athenians
to
yield
to
their
taste
the
songs
which
spoke
of
their
own
great
ancestor
were
no
doubt
of
far
inferior
sublimity
and
popularity
or
at
first
sight
a
theseid
would
have
been
much
more
likely
to
have
emanated
from
an
athenian
synod
of
compilers
of
ancient
song
than
an
achilleid
or
an
odysseid
could
france
have
given
birth
to
a
tasso
tancred
would
have
been
the
hero
of
the
jerusalem
if
however
the
homeric
ballads
as
they
are
sometimes
called
which
related
the
wrath
of
achilles
with
all
its
direful
consequences
were
so
far
superior
to
the
rest
of
the
poetic
cycle
as
to
admit
no
rivalry
it
is
still
surprising
that
throughout
the
whole
poem
the
callida
junctura
should
never
betray
the
workmanship
of
an
athenian
hand
and
that
the
national
spirit
of
a
race
who
have
at
a
later
period
not
inaptly
been
compared
to
our
neighbours
the
french
should
submit
with
lofty
to
the
almost
total
exclusion
of
their
own
ancestors
or
at
least
to
the
questionable
dignity
of
only
having
produced
a
leader
tolerably
skilled
in
the
military
tactics
of
his
age
to
return
to
the
wolfian
theory
while
it
is
to
be
confessed
that
wolf
objections
to
the
primitive
integrity
of
the
iliad
and
odyssey
have
never
been
wholly
got
over
we
can
not
help
discovering
that
they
have
failed
to
enlighten
us
as
to
any
substantial
point
and
that
the
difficulties
with
which
the
whole
subject
is
beset
are
rather
augmented
than
otherwise
if
we
admit
his
hypothesis
nor
is
lachmann
modification
of
his
theory
any
better
he
divides
the
first
books
of
the
iliad
into
sixteen
different
songs
and
treats
as
ridiculous
the
belief
that
their
amalgamation
into
one
regular
poem
belongs
to
a
period
earlier
than
the
age
of
peisistratus
this
as
grote
observes
the
gaps
and
contradictions
in
the
narrative
but
it
explains
nothing
else
moreover
we
find
no
contradictions
warranting
this
belief
and
the
sixteen
poets
concur
in
getting
rid
of
the
following
leading
men
in
the
first
battle
after
the
secession
of
achilles
elphenor
chief
of
the
euboeans
tlepolemus
of
the
rhodians
pandarus
of
the
lycians
odins
of
the
halizonians
pirous
and
acamas
of
the
thracians
none
of
these
heroes
again
make
their
appearance
and
we
can
but
agree
with
colonel
mure
that
it
seems
strange
that
any
number
of
independent
poets
should
have
so
harmoniously
dispensed
with
the
services
of
all
six
in
the
sequel
the
discrepancy
by
which
pylaemenes
who
is
represented
as
dead
in
the
fifth
book
weeps
at
his
son
funeral
in
the
thirteenth
can
only
be
regarded
as
the
result
of
an
interpolation
grote
although
not
very
distinct
in
stating
his
own
opinions
on
the
subject
has
done
much
to
clearly
show
the
incongruity
of
the
wolfian
theory
and
of
lachmann
modifications
with
the
character
of
peisistratus
but
he
has
also
shown
and
we
think
with
equal
success
that
the
two
questions
relative
to
the
primitive
unity
of
these
poems
or
supposing
that
impossible
the
unison
of
these
parts
by
peisistratus
and
not
before
his
time
are
essentially
distinct
in
short
a
man
may
believe
the
iliad
to
have
been
put
together
out
of
songs
without
recognising
the
age
of
peisistratus
as
the
period
of
its
first
compilation
the
friends
or
literary
of
peisistratus
must
have
found
an
iliad
that
was
already
ancient
and
the
silence
of
the
alexandrine
critics
respecting
the
peisistratic
recension
goes
far
to
prove
that
among
the
numerous
manuscripts
they
examined
this
was
either
wanting
or
thought
unworthy
of
attention
moreover
he
continues
the
whole
tenor
of
the
poems
themselves
confirms
what
is
here
remarked
there
is
nothing
either
in
the
iliad
or
odyssey
which
savours
of
modernism
applying
that
term
to
the
age
of
peisistratus
nothing
which
brings
to
our
view
the
alterations
brought
about
by
two
centuries
in
the
greek
language
the
coined
money
the
habits
of
writing
and
reading
the
despotisms
and
republican
governments
the
close
military
array
the
improved
construction
of
ships
the
amphiktyonic
convocations
the
mutual
frequentation
of
religious
festivals
the
oriental
and
egyptian
veins
of
religion
familiar
to
the
latter
epoch
these
alterations
onomakritus
and
the
other
literary
friends
of
peisistratus
could
hardly
have
failed
to
notice
even
without
design
had
they
then
for
the
first
time
undertaken
the
task
of
piecing
together
many
epics
into
one
large
aggregate
everything
in
the
two
great
homeric
poems
both
in
substance
and
in
language
belongs
to
an
age
two
or
three
centuries
earlier
than
peisistratus
indeed
even
the
interpolations
or
those
passages
which
on
the
best
grounds
are
pronounced
to
be
such
betray
no
trace
of
the
sixth
century
before
christ
and
may
well
have
been
heard
by
archilochus
and
kallinus
in
some
cases
even
by
arktinus
and
hesiod
as
genuine
homeric
matter
as
far
as
the
evidences
on
the
case
as
well
internal
as
external
enable
us
to
judge
we
seem
warranted
in
believing
that
the
iliad
and
odyssey
were
recited
substantially
as
they
now
stand
always
allowing
for
partial
divergences
of
text
and
interpolations
in
our
first
trustworthy
mark
of
grecian
time
and
this
ancient
date
let
it
be
added
as
it
is
the
fact
so
it
is
also
the
most
important
attribute
of
the
homeric
poems
considered
in
reference
to
grecian
history
for
they
thus
afford
us
an
insight
into
the
character
of
the
greeks
enabling
us
to
trace
the
subsequent
forward
march
of
the
nation
and
to
seize
instructive
contrasts
between
their
former
and
their
later
condition
on
the
whole
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
the
labours
of
peisistratus
were
wholly
of
an
editorial
character
although
i
must
confess
that
i
can
lay
down
nothing
respecting
the
extent
of
his
labours
at
the
same
time
so
far
from
believing
that
the
composition
or
primary
arrangement
of
these
poems
in
their
present
form
was
the
work
of
peisistratus
i
am
rather
persuaded
that
the
fine
taste
and
elegant
mind
of
that
athenian
would
lead
him
to
preserve
an
ancient
and
traditional
order
of
the
poems
rather
than
to
patch
and
reconstruct
them
according
to
a
fanciful
hypothesis
i
will
not
repeat
the
many
discussions
respecting
whether
the
poems
were
written
or
not
or
whether
the
art
of
writing
was
known
in
the
time
of
their
reputed
author
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
more
we
read
the
less
satisfied
we
are
upon
either
subject
i
can
not
however
help
thinking
that
the
story
which
attributes
the
preservation
of
these
poems
to
lycurgus
is
little
else
than
a
version
of
the
same
story
as
that
of
peisistratus
while
its
historical
probability
must
be
measured
by
that
of
many
others
relating
to
the
spartan
confucius
i
will
conclude
this
sketch
of
the
homeric
theories
with
an
attempt
made
by
an
ingenious
friend
to
unite
them
into
something
like
consistency
it
is
as
follows
no
doubt
the
common
soldiers
of
that
age
had
like
the
common
sailors
of
some
fifty
years
ago
some
one
qualified
to
in
excellent
music
among
them
many
of
these
like
those
of
the
negroes
in
the
united
states
were
extemporaneous
and
allusive
to
events
passing
around
them
but
what
was
passing
around
them
the
grand
events
of
a
war
occurrences
likely
to
impress
themselves
as
the
mystical
legends
of
former
times
had
done
upon
their
memory
besides
which
a
retentive
memory
was
deemed
a
virtue
of
the
first
water
and
was
cultivated
accordingly
in
those
ancient
times
ballads
at
first
and
down
to
the
beginning
of
the
war
with
troy
were
merely
recitations
with
an
intonation
then
followed
a
species
of
recitative
probably
with
an
intoned
burden
tune
next
followed
as
it
aided
the
memory
considerably
it
was
at
this
period
about
four
hundred
years
after
the
war
that
a
poet
flourished
of
the
name
of
melesigenes
or
moeonides
but
most
probably
the
former
he
saw
that
these
ballads
might
be
made
of
great
utility
to
his
purpose
of
writing
a
poem
on
the
social
position
of
hellas
and
as
a
collection
he
published
these
lays
connecting
them
by
a
tale
of
his
own
this
poem
now
exists
under
the
title
of
the
the
author
however
did
not
affix
his
own
name
to
the
poem
which
in
fact
was
great
part
of
it
remodelled
from
the
archaic
dialect
of
crete
in
which
tongue
the
ballads
were
found
by
him
he
therefore
called
it
the
poem
of
homeros
or
the
collector
but
this
is
rather
a
proof
of
his
modesty
and
talent
than
of
his
mere
drudging
arrangement
of
other
people
ideas
for
as
grote
has
finely
observed
arguing
for
the
unity
of
authorship
great
poet
might
have
separate
songs
into
one
comprehensive
whole
but
no
mere
arrangers
or
compilers
would
be
competent
to
do
so
while
employed
on
the
wild
legend
of
odysseus
he
met
with
a
ballad
recording
the
quarrel
of
achilles
and
agamemnon
his
noble
mind
seized
the
hint
that
there
presented
itself
and
the
achilleis
grew
under
his
hand
unity
of
design
however
caused
him
to
publish
the
poem
under
the
same
pseudonyme
as
his
former
work
and
the
disjointed
lays
of
the
ancient
bards
were
joined
together
like
those
relating
to
the
cid
into
a
chronicle
history
named
the
iliad
melesigenes
knew
that
the
poem
was
destined
to
be
a
lasting
one
and
so
it
has
proved
but
first
the
poems
were
destined
to
undergo
many
vicissitudes
and
corruptions
by
the
people
who
took
to
singing
them
in
the
streets
assemblies
and
agoras
however
solon
first
and
then
peisistratus
and
afterwards
aristoteles
and
others
revised
the
poems
and
restored
the
works
of
melesigenes
homeros
to
their
original
integrity
in
a
great
measure
having
thus
given
some
general
notion
of
the
strange
theories
which
have
developed
themselves
respecting
this
most
interesting
subject
i
must
still
express
my
conviction
as
to
the
unity
of
the
authorship
of
the
homeric
poems
to
deny
that
many
corruptions
and
interpolations
disfigure
them
and
that
the
intrusive
hand
of
the
poetasters
may
here
and
there
have
inflicted
a
wound
more
serious
than
the
negligence
of
the
copyist
would
be
an
absurd
and
captious
assumption
but
it
is
to
a
higher
criticism
that
we
must
appeal
if
we
would
either
understand
or
enjoy
these
poems
in
maintaining
the
authenticity
and
personality
of
their
one
author
be
he
homer
or
melesigenes
nomine
vocari
eum
jus
fasque
i
feel
conscious
that
while
the
whole
weight
of
historical
evidence
is
against
the
hypothesis
which
would
assign
these
great
works
to
a
plurality
of
authors
the
most
powerful
internal
evidence
and
that
which
springs
from
the
deepest
and
most
immediate
impulse
of
the
soul
also
speaks
eloquently
to
the
contrary
the
minutiae
of
verbal
criticism
i
am
far
from
seeking
to
despise
indeed
considering
the
character
of
some
of
my
own
books
such
an
attempt
would
be
gross
inconsistency
but
while
i
appreciate
its
importance
in
a
philological
view
i
am
inclined
to
set
little
store
on
its
aesthetic
value
especially
in
poetry
three
parts
of
the
emendations
made
upon
poets
are
mere
alterations
some
of
which
had
they
been
suggested
to
the
author
by
his
maecenas
or
africanus
he
would
probably
have
adopted
moreover
those
who
are
most
exact
in
laying
down
rules
of
verbal
criticism
and
interpretation
are
often
least
competent
to
carry
out
their
own
precepts
grammarians
are
not
poets
by
profession
but
may
be
so
per
accidens
i
do
not
at
this
moment
remember
two
emendations
on
homer
calculated
to
substantially
improve
the
poetry
of
a
passage
although
a
mass
of
remarks
from
herodotus
down
to
loewe
have
given
us
the
history
of
a
thousand
minute
points
without
which
our
greek
knowledge
would
be
gloomy
and
jejune
but
it
is
not
on
words
only
that
grammarians
mere
grammarians
will
exercise
their
elaborate
and
often
tiresome
ingenuity
binding
down
an
heroic
or
dramatic
poet
to
the
block
upon
which
they
have
previously
dissected
his
words
and
sentences
they
proceed
to
use
the
axe
and
the
pruning
knife
by
wholesale
and
inconsistent
in
everything
but
their
wish
to
make
out
a
case
of
unlawful
affiliation
they
cut
out
book
after
book
passage
after
passage
till
the
author
is
reduced
to
a
collection
of
fragments
or
till
those
who
fancied
they
possessed
the
works
of
some
great
man
find
that
they
have
been
put
off
with
a
vile
counterfeit
got
up
at
second
hand
if
we
compare
the
theories
of
knight
wolf
lachmann
and
others
we
shall
feel
better
satisfied
of
the
utter
uncertainty
of
criticism
than
of
the
apocryphal
position
of
homer
one
rejects
what
another
considers
the
of
his
theory
one
cuts
a
supposed
knot
by
expunging
what
another
would
explain
by
omitting
something
else
nor
is
this
morbid
species
of
sagacity
by
any
means
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
literary
novelty
justus
lipsius
a
scholar
of
no
ordinary
skill
seems
to
revel
in
the
imaginary
discovery
that
the
tragedies
attributed
to
seneca
are
by
four
different
authors
now
i
will
venture
to
assert
that
these
tragedies
are
so
uniform
not
only
in
their
borrowed
phraseology
a
phraseology
with
which
writers
like
boethius
and
saxo
grammaticus
were
more
charmed
than
ourselves
in
their
freedom
from
real
poetry
and
last
but
not
least
in
an
and
consistent
abandonment
of
good
taste
that
few
writers
of
the
present
day
would
question
the
capabilities
of
the
same
gentleman
be
he
seneca
or
not
to
produce
not
only
these
but
a
great
many
more
equally
bad
with
equal
sagacity
father
hardouin
astonished
the
world
with
the
startling
announcement
that
the
aeneid
of
virgil
and
the
satires
of
horace
were
literary
deceptions
now
without
wishing
to
say
one
word
of
disrespect
against
the
industry
and
learning
nay
the
refined
acuteness
which
scholars
like
wolf
have
bestowed
upon
this
subject
i
must
express
my
fears
that
many
of
our
modern
homeric
theories
will
become
matter
for
the
surprise
and
entertainment
rather
than
the
instruction
of
posterity
nor
can
i
help
thinking
that
the
literary
history
of
more
recent
times
will
account
for
many
points
of
difficulty
in
the
transmission
of
the
iliad
and
odyssey
to
a
period
so
remote
from
that
of
their
first
creation
i
have
already
expressed
my
belief
that
the
labours
of
peisistratus
were
of
a
purely
editorial
character
and
there
seems
no
more
reason
why
corrupt
and
imperfect
editions
of
homer
may
not
have
been
abroad
in
his
day
than
that
the
poems
of
valerius
flaccus
and
tibullus
should
have
given
so
much
trouble
to
poggio
scaliger
and
others
but
after
all
the
main
fault
in
all
the
homeric
theories
is
that
they
demand
too
great
a
sacrifice
of
those
feelings
to
which
poetry
most
powerfully
appeals
and
which
are
its
most
fitting
judges
the
ingenuity
which
has
sought
to
rob
us
of
the
name
and
existence
of
homer
does
too
much
violence
to
that
inward
emotion
which
makes
our
whole
soul
yearn
with
love
and
admiration
for
the
blind
bard
of
chios
to
believe
the
author
of
the
iliad
a
mere
compiler
is
to
degrade
the
powers
of
human
invention
to
elevate
analytical
judgment
at
the
expense
of
the
most
ennobling
impulses
of
the
soul
and
to
forget
the
ocean
in
the
contemplation
of
a
polypus
there
is
a
catholicity
so
to
speak
in
the
very
name
of
homer
our
faith
in
the
author
of
the
iliad
may
be
a
mistaken
one
but
as
yet
nobody
has
taught
us
a
better
while
however
i
look
upon
the
belief
in
homer
as
one
that
has
nature
herself
for
its
mainspring
while
i
can
join
with
old
ennius
in
believing
in
homer
as
the
ghost
who
like
some
patron
saint
hovers
round
the
bed
of
the
poet
and
even
bestows
rare
gifts
from
that
wealth
of
imagination
which
a
host
of
imitators
could
not
exhaust
still
i
am
far
from
wishing
to
deny
that
the
author
of
these
great
poems
found
a
rich
fund
of
tradition
a
mythical
storehouse
from
whence
he
might
derive
both
subject
and
embellishment
but
it
is
one
thing
to
use
existing
romances
in
the
embellishment
of
a
poem
another
to
patch
up
the
poem
itself
from
such
materials
what
consistency
of
style
and
execution
can
be
hoped
for
from
such
an
attempt
or
rather
what
bad
taste
and
tedium
will
not
be
the
infallible
result
a
blending
of
popular
legends
and
a
free
use
of
the
songs
of
other
bards
are
features
perfectly
consistent
with
poetical
originality
in
fact
the
most
original
writer
is
still
drawing
upon
outward
impressions
nay
even
his
own
thoughts
are
a
kind
of
secondary
agents
which
support
and
feed
the
impulses
of
imagination
but
unless
there
be
some
grand
pervading
principle
some
invisible
yet
most
distinctly
stamped
archetypus
of
the
great
whole
a
poem
like
the
iliad
can
never
come
to
the
birth
traditions
the
most
picturesque
episodes
the
most
pathetic
local
associations
teeming
with
the
thoughts
of
gods
and
great
men
may
crowd
in
one
mighty
vision
or
reveal
themselves
in
more
substantial
forms
to
the
mind
of
the
poet
but
except
the
power
to
create
a
grand
whole
to
which
these
shall
be
but
as
details
and
embellishments
be
present
we
shall
have
nought
but
a
a
parterre
filled
with
flowers
and
weeds
strangling
each
other
in
their
wild
redundancy
we
shall
have
a
cento
of
rags
and
tatters
which
will
require
little
acuteness
to
detect
sensible
as
i
am
of
the
difficulty
of
disproving
a
negative
and
aware
as
i
must
be
of
the
weighty
grounds
there
are
for
opposing
my
belief
it
still
seems
to
me
that
the
homeric
question
is
one
that
is
reserved
for
a
higher
criticism
than
it
has
often
obtained
we
are
not
by
nature
intended
to
know
all
things
still
less
to
compass
the
powers
by
which
the
greatest
blessings
of
life
have
been
placed
at
our
disposal
were
faith
no
virtue
then
we
might
indeed
wonder
why
god
willed
our
ignorance
on
any
matter
but
we
are
too
well
taught
the
contrary
lesson
and
it
seems
as
though
our
faith
should
be
especially
tried
touching
the
men
and
the
events
which
have
wrought
most
influence
upon
the
condition
of
humanity
and
there
is
a
kind
of
sacredness
attached
to
the
memory
of
the
great
and
the
good
which
seems
to
bid
us
repulse
the
scepticism
which
would
allegorize
their
existence
into
a
pleasing
apologue
and
measure
the
giants
of
intellect
by
an
homaeopathic
dynameter
long
and
habitual
reading
of
homer
appears
to
familiarize
our
thoughts
even
to
his
incongruities
or
rather
if
we
read
in
a
right
spirit
and
with
a
heartfelt
appreciation
we
are
too
much
dazzled
too
deeply
wrapped
in
admiration
of
the
whole
to
dwell
upon
the
minute
spots
which
mere
analysis
can
discover
in
reading
an
heroic
poem
we
must
transform
ourselves
into
heroes
of
the
time
being
we
in
imagination
must
fight
over
the
same
battles
woo
the
same
loves
burn
with
the
same
sense
of
injury
as
an
achilles
or
a
hector
and
if
we
can
but
attain
this
degree
of
enthusiasm
and
less
enthusiasm
will
scarcely
suffice
for
the
reading
of
homer
we
shall
feel
that
the
poems
of
homer
are
not
only
the
work
of
one
writer
but
of
the
greatest
writer
that
ever
touched
the
hearts
of
men
by
the
power
of
song
and
it
was
this
supposed
unity
of
authorship
which
gave
these
poems
their
powerful
influence
over
the
minds
of
the
men
of
old
heeren
who
is
evidently
little
disposed
in
favour
of
modern
theories
finely
observes
it
was
homer
who
formed
the
character
of
the
greek
nation
no
poet
has
ever
as
a
poet
exercised
a
similar
influence
over
his
countrymen
prophets
lawgivers
and
sages
have
formed
the
character
of
other
nations
it
was
reserved
to
a
poet
to
form
that
of
the
greeks
this
is
a
feature
in
their
character
which
was
not
wholly
erased
even
in
the
period
of
their
degeneracy
when
lawgivers
and
sages
appeared
in
greece
the
work
of
the
poet
had
already
been
accomplished
and
they
paid
homage
to
his
superior
genius
he
held
up
before
his
nation
the
mirror
in
which
they
were
to
behold
the
world
of
gods
and
heroes
no
less
than
of
feeble
mortals
and
to
behold
them
reflected
with
purity
and
truth
his
poems
are
founded
on
the
first
feeling
of
human
nature
on
the
love
of
children
wife
and
country
on
that
passion
which
outweighs
all
others
the
love
of
glory
his
songs
were
poured
forth
from
a
breast
which
sympathized
with
all
the
feelings
of
man
and
therefore
they
enter
and
will
continue
to
enter
every
breast
which
cherishes
the
same
sympathies
if
it
is
granted
to
his
immortal
spirit
from
another
heaven
than
any
of
which
he
dreamed
on
earth
to
look
down
on
his
race
to
see
the
nations
from
the
fields
of
asia
to
the
forests
of
hercynia
performing
pilgrimages
to
the
fountain
which
his
magic
wand
caused
to
flow
if
it
is
permitted
to
him
to
view
the
vast
assemblage
of
grand
of
elevated
of
glorious
productions
which
had
been
called
into
being
by
means
of
his
songs
wherever
his
immortal
spirit
may
reside
this
alone
would
suffice
to
complete
his
happiness
can
we
contemplate
that
ancient
monument
on
which
the
apotheosis
of
homer
is
depictured
and
not
feel
how
much
of
pleasing
association
how
much
that
appeals
most
forcibly
and
most
distinctly
to
our
minds
is
lost
by
the
admittance
of
any
theory
but
our
old
tradition
the
more
we
read
and
the
more
we
think
think
as
becomes
the
readers
of
homer
the
more
rooted
becomes
the
conviction
that
the
father
of
poetry
gave
us
this
rich
inheritance
whole
and
entire
whatever
were
the
means
of
its
preservation
let
us
rather
be
thankful
for
the
treasury
of
taste
and
eloquence
thus
laid
open
to
our
use
than
seek
to
make
it
a
mere
centre
around
which
to
drive
a
series
of
theories
whose
wildness
is
only
equalled
by
their
inconsistency
with
each
other
as
the
hymns
and
some
other
poems
usually
ascribed
to
homer
are
not
included
in
pope
translation
i
will
content
myself
with
a
brief
account
of
the
battle
of
the
frogs
and
mice
from
the
pen
of
a
writer
who
has
done
it
full
justice
this
poem
says
coleridge
is
a
short
of
ancient
date
the
text
varies
in
different
editions
and
is
obviously
disturbed
and
corrupt
to
a
great
degree
it
is
commonly
said
to
have
been
a
juvenile
essay
of
homer
genius
others
have
attributed
it
to
the
same
pigrees
mentioned
above
and
whose
reputation
for
humour
seems
to
have
invited
the
appropriation
of
any
piece
of
ancient
wit
the
author
of
which
was
uncertain
so
little
did
the
greeks
before
the
age
of
the
ptolemies
know
or
care
about
that
department
of
criticism
employed
in
determining
the
genuineness
of
ancient
writings
as
to
this
little
poem
being
a
youthful
prolusion
of
homer
it
seems
sufficient
to
say
that
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
it
is
a
plain
and
palpable
parody
not
only
of
the
general
spirit
but
of
numerous
passages
of
the
iliad
itself
and
even
if
no
such
intention
to
parody
were
discernible
in
it
the
objection
would
still
remain
that
to
suppose
a
work
of
mere
burlesque
to
be
the
primary
effort
of
poetry
in
a
simple
age
seems
to
reverse
that
order
in
the
development
of
national
taste
which
the
history
of
every
other
people
in
europe
and
of
many
in
asia
has
almost
ascertained
to
be
a
law
of
the
human
mind
it
is
in
a
state
of
society
much
more
refined
and
permanent
than
that
described
in
the
iliad
that
any
popularity
would
attend
such
a
ridicule
of
war
and
the
gods
as
is
contained
in
this
poem
and
the
fact
of
there
having
existed
three
other
poems
of
the
same
kind
attributed
for
aught
we
can
see
with
as
much
reason
to
homer
is
a
strong
inducement
to
believe
that
none
of
them
were
of
the
homeric
age
knight
infers
from
the
usage
of
the
word
tablet
instead
of
which
according
to
herod
was
the
material
employed
by
the
asiatic
greeks
for
that
purpose
that
this
poem
was
another
offspring
of
attic
ingenuity
and
generally
that
the
familiar
mention
of
the
cock
is
a
strong
argument
against
so
ancient
a
date
for
its
composition
having
thus
given
a
brief
account
of
the
poems
comprised
in
design
i
will
now
proceed
to
make
a
few
remarks
on
his
translation
and
on
my
own
purpose
in
the
present
edition
pope
was
not
a
grecian
his
whole
education
had
been
irregular
and
his
earliest
acquaintance
with
the
poet
was
through
the
version
of
ogilby
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
his
whole
work
bears
the
impress
of
a
disposition
to
be
satisfied
with
the
general
sense
rather
than
to
dive
deeply
into
the
minute
and
delicate
features
of
language
hence
his
whole
work
is
to
be
looked
upon
rather
as
an
elegant
paraphrase
than
a
translation
there
are
to
be
sure
certain
conventional
anecdotes
which
prove
that
pope
consulted
various
friends
whose
classical
attainments
were
sounder
than
his
own
during
the
undertaking
but
it
is
probable
that
these
examinations
were
the
result
rather
of
the
contradictory
versions
already
existing
than
of
a
desire
to
make
a
perfect
transcript
of
the
original
and
in
those
days
what
is
called
literal
translation
was
less
cultivated
than
at
present
if
something
like
the
general
sense
could
be
decorated
with
the
easy
gracefulness
of
a
practised
poet
if
the
charms
of
metrical
cadence
and
a
pleasing
fluency
could
be
made
consistent
with
a
fair
interpretation
of
the
poet
meaning
his
words
were
less
jealously
sought
for
and
those
who
could
read
so
good
a
poem
as
pope
iliad
had
fair
reason
to
be
satisfied
it
would
be
absurd
therefore
to
test
pope
translation
by
our
own
advancing
knowledge
of
the
original
text
we
must
be
content
to
look
at
it
as
a
most
delightful
work
in
itself
a
work
which
is
as
much
a
part
of
english
literature
as
homer
himself
is
of
greek
we
must
not
be
torn
from
our
kindly
associations
with
the
old
iliad
that
once
was
our
most
cherished
companion
or
our
most
prize
merely
because
buttmann
loewe
and
liddell
have
made
us
so
much
more
accurate
as
to
being
an
adjective
and
not
a
substantive
far
be
it
from
us
to
defend
the
faults
of
pope
especially
when
we
think
of
chapman
fine
bold
rough
old
english
far
be
it
from
us
to
hold
up
his
translation
as
what
a
translation
of
homer
might
be
but
we
can
still
dismiss
pope
iliad
to
the
hands
of
our
readers
with
the
consciousness
that
they
must
have
read
a
very
great
number
of

they

true
as

in

an

of

with

through

wandering
down

bloomy

odours
round
a

where
if

touch
the

him
entering

to

stand
still
confess
though
distant
far
they
lie
to

but
sad
ulysses
by
himself
apart
pour
the
big
sorrows
of
his
swelling
heard
all
on
the
lonely
shore
he
sate
to
weep
and
roll
his

around
the

toward
his

he
roll
his

in
vain
till

with
rising

they
stream

thus
having

hermes
the

partook
divine
refection
then
recruited
spoke
what
moves
this
journey
from
my
native
sky
a
goddess
asks
nor
can
a
god
deny
hear
then
the
truth
by
mighty
jove
command
unwilling
have
i
trod
this
pleasing
land
for
who
with
weary
wing
would
sweep
such
length
of
ocean
and
unmeasured
deep
a
world
of
waters
far
from
all
the
ways
where
men
frequent
or
sacred
altars
blaze
but
to
jove
will
submission
we
must
pay
what
power
so
great
to
dare
to
disobey
a
man
he
says
a
man
resides
with
thee
of
all
his
kind
most
worn
with
misery
the
greeks
whose
arms
for
nine
long
year
their
force
on
ilion
in
the
tenth
destroy
at
length
embarking
in
a
luckless
hour
with
conquest
proud
incensed
minerva
power
hence
on
the
guilty
race
her
vengeance
hurl
with
storms
pursued
them
through
the
liquid
world
there
all
his
vessels
sunk
beneath
the
wave
there
all
his
dear
companions
found
their
grave
saved
from
the
jaws
of
death
by
heaven
decree
the
tempest
drove
him
to
these
shores
and
thee
him
jove
now
orders
to
his
native
lands
straight
to
dismiss
so
destiny
commands
impatient
fate
his
near
return
attends
and
calls
him
to
his
country
and
his
friends
to
her
inmost
soul
the
goddess
shook
then
thus
her
anguish
and
her
passion
broke
ungracious
gods
with
spite
and
envy
cursed
still
to
your
own
ethereal
race
the
worst
ye
envy
mortal
and
immortal
joy
and
love
the
only
sweet
of
life
destroy
did
ever
goddess
by
her
charms
engage
a
favour
mortal
and
not
feel
your
rage
so
when
aurora
sought
orion
love
her
joys
disturbed
your
blissful
hours
above
till
in
ortygia
dian
winged
dart
had
pierced
the
hapless
hunter
to
the
heart
so
when
the
covert
of
the
field
saw
stately
ceres
to
her
passion
yield
scarce
could
iasion
taste
her
heavenly
charms
but
jove
swift
lightning
scorched
him
in
her
arms
and
is
it
now
my
turn
ye
mighty
powers
am
i
the
envy
of
your
blissful
bowers
a
man
an
outcast
to
the
storm
and
wave
it
was
my
crime
to
pity
and
to
save
when
he
who
thunders
rent
his
bark
in
twain
and
sunk
his
brave
companions
in
the
main
alone
abandon
in
tossed
the
sport
of
winds
and
driven
from
every
coast
hither
this
man
of
miseries
i
led
received
the
friendless
and
the
hungry
fed
nay
promised
vainly
promised
to
bestow
immortal
life
exempt
from
age
and
woe
is
jove
decrees
he
shall
remove
gods
as
we
are
we
are
but
slaves
to
jove
go
then
he
must
he
must
if
he
ordain
try
all
those
dangers
all
those
deeps
again
but
never
never
shall
calypso
send
to
toils
like
these
her
husband
and
her
friend
what
ships
have
i
what
sailors
to
convey
what
oars
to
cut
the
long
laborious
way
yet
i
direct
the
safest
means
to
go
that
last
advice
is
all
i
can
bestow
to
her
the
power
who
hears
the
charming
rod
dismiss
the
man
nor
irritate
the
god
prevent
the
rage
of
him
who
reigns
above
for
what
so
dreadful
as
the
wrath
of
jove
thus
having
said
he
cut
the
cleaving
sky
and
in
a
moment
vanished
from
her
eye
the
nymph
obedient
to
divine
command
to
seek
ulysses
paced
along
the
sand
him
pensive
on
the
lonely
beach
she
found
with
streaming
eyes
in
briny
torrents
drown
and
inly
pining
for
his
native
shore
for
now
the
soft
enchantress
pleased
no
more
for
now
reluctant
and
constrained
by
charms
absent
he
lay
in
her
desiring
arms
in
slumber
wore
the
heavy
night
away
on
rocks
and
shores
consumed
the
tedious
day
there
sate
all
desolate
and
sighed
alone
with
echoing
sorrows
made
the
mountains
groan
and
roll
his
eyes
all
the
restless
main
till
dimmed
with
rising
grief
they
streamed
again
here
on
his
musing
mood
the
goddess
press
approaching
soft
and
thus
the
chief
address
unhappy
man
to
wasting
woes
a
prey
no
more
in
sorrows
languish
life
away
free
as
the
winds
i
give
thee
now
to
rove
go
fell
the
timber
of
yon
lofty
grove
and
form
a
raft
and
build
the
rising
ship
sublime
to
bear
thee
the
gloomy
deep
to
store
the
vessel
let
the
care
be
mine
with
water
from
the
rock
and
rosy
wine
and
bread
and
fair
array
and
prosperous
gales
to
waft
thee
on
the
way
these
if
the
gods
with
my
desire
comply
the
gods
alas
more
mighty
far
than
i
and
better
skill
in
dark
events
to
come
in
peace
shall
land
thee
at
thy
native
home
with
sighs
ulysses
heard
the
words
she
spoke
then
thus
his
melancholy
silence
broke
some
other
motive
goddess
sways
thy
mind
some
close
design
or
turn
of
womankind
nor
my
return
the
end
nor
this
the
way
on
a
slight
raft
to
pass
the
swelling
sea
huge
horrid
vast
where
scarce
in
safety
sails
the
ship
though
jove
inspires
the
gales
the
bold
proposal
how
shall
i
fulfil
dark
as
i
am
unconscious
of
thy
will
swear
then
thou
not
what
my
soul
forebodes
swear
by
the
solemn
oath
that
binds
the
gods
him
while
he
spoke
with
smiles
calypso
eyed
and
gently
grasp
his
hand
and
thus
replied
this
shows
thee
friend
by
old
experience
taught
and
learn
in
all
the
wiles
of
human
thought
how
prone
to
doubt
how
cautious
are
the
wise
but
hear
o
earth
and
hear
ye
sacred
skies
and
thou
o
styx
whose
formidable
floods
glide
through
the
shades
and
bind
the
attesting
gods
no
form
design
no
meditated
end
lurks
in
the
counsel
of
thy
faithful
friend
kind
the
persuasion
and
sincere
my
aim
the
same
my
practice
were
my
fate
the
same
heaven
has
not
cursed
me
with
a
heart
of
steel
but
given
the
sense
to
pity
and
to
feel
thus
having
said
the
goddess
marched
before
he
trod
her
footsteps
in
the
sandy
shore
at
the
cool
cave
arrived
they
took
their
state
he
filled
the
throne
where
mercury
had
sate
for
him
the
nymph
a
rich
repast
ordains
such
as
the
mortal
life
of
man
sustains
before
herself
were
placed
the
the
cates
divine
ambrosial
banquet
and
celestial
wine
their
hunger
satiate
and
their
thirst
repress
thus
spoke
calypso
to
her
godlike
guest
ulysses
with
a
sigh
she
thus
began
o
sprung
from
gods
in
wisdom
more
than
man
is
then
thy
home
the
passion
of
thy
heart
thus
wilt
thou
leave
me
are
we
thus
to
part
farewell
and
ever
joyful
mayst
thou
be
nor
break
the
transport
with
one
thought
of
me
but
ah
ulysses
wert
thou
given
to
know
what
fate
yet
dooms
these
still
to
undergo
thy
heart
might
settle
in
this
scene
of
ease
and
these
slighted
charms
might
learn
to
please
a
willing
goddess
and
immortal
life
might
banish
from
thy
mind
an
absent
wife
am
i
inferior
to
a
mortal
dame
less
soft
my
feature
less
august
my
frame
or
shall
the
daughters
of
mankind
compare
their
earth
born
beauties
with
the
heavenly
fair
alas
for
this
the
prudent
man
replies
against
ulysses
shall
thy
anger
rise
loved
and
adored
o
goddess
as
thou
art
forgive
the
weakness
of
a
human
heart
though
well
i
see
thy
graces
far
above
the
dear
though
mortal
object
of
my
love
of
youth
eternal
well
the
difference
know
and
the
short
date
of
fading
charms
below
yet
every
day
while
absent
thus
i
roam
i
languish
to
return
and
die
at
home
the
gods
shall
destine
me
to
bear
in
the
black
ocean
or
the
watery
war
mine
to
master
with
a
constant
mind
inured
to
perils
to
the
worst
resign
by

by

so
many
dangers
run
still
i
can
suffer
their
high

thus
while
he
spoke
the
beamy
sun
descends
and
rising
night
her
friendly
shade
extends
to
the
close
grot
the
lonely
pair

and
slept
delighted
with
the
gifts
of

when
rose
morning
call
them
from
their

ulysses
robed
him
in

wrought
of

then
to

on
the

there
stood
of

a

leafless
summits
to

aspire

by

by

already
dried

with

by

the

with

he
pierced
them
and
with
clinchers
bound
long
and
capacious
as
a

forms
some

broad

he
rigged

with

ulysses
spreads
his

placed
at

sate

then
swell
to

phaeacia
dusky

half
in

lay
before

indistinct

him
thus
voyaging

below
from

on
solyme

the

and
seeing

the
raging

shook
his
azure

and
thus
in
secret
to
his

he
said
heavens
how
uncertain
are
the

on

is
then
reversed
the
sentence
of

in

behold
how

is
then
our

vain
no

shook
the

his

wretch
that
i

what
farther
fates
attend

not

bade
the

to

the

of

the

of

away

him
soft
on

away
with
gentle
force
impelling
to
that
shore
where
fate
has
destined
he
shall
toil
no
more
and
now
two
nights
and
now
two
days
were
pass
since
wide
he
wander
on
the
watery
waste
heaved
on
the
surge
with
intermitting
breath
and
hourly
panting
in
the
arms
of
death
the
third
fair
morn
now
blazed
upon
the
main
then
glassy
smooth
lay
all
the
liquid
plain
the
winds
were
hush
the
billows
scarcely
curl
and
a
dead
silence
still
the
watery
world
when
lifted
on
a
ridgy
wave
he
spies
the
land
at
distance
and
with
sharpen
eyes
as
pious
children
joy
with
vast
delight
when
a
loved
sire
revives
before
their
sight
who
lingering
along
has
call
on
death
in
vain
fix
by
some
demon
to
his
bed
of
pain
till
heaven
by
miracle
his
life
restore
so
joys
ulysses
at
the
appearing
shore
and
sees
and
labours
onward
as
he
sees
the
rising
forests
and
the
tufted
trees
and
now
as
near
approaching
as
the
sound
of
human
voice
the
listening
ear
may
wound
amidst
the
rocks
he
heard
a
hollow
roar
of
murmuring
surges
breaking
on
the
shore
nor
peaceful
port
was
there
nor
winding
bay
to
shield
the
vessel
from
the
rolling
sea
but
cliffs
and
shaggy
shores
a
dreadful
sight
all
rough
with
rocks
with
foamy
billows
white
fear
seized
his
slacken
limbs
and
beating
heart
as
thus
he
communed
with
his
soul
apart
ah
me
when
a
length
of
waters
toss
these
eyes
at
last
behold
the
coast
no
port
receives
me
from
the
angry
main
but
the
loud
deeps
demand
me
back
again
above
sharp
rocks
forbid
access
around
roar
the
wild
waves
beneath
is
sea
profound
no
footing
sure
affords
the
faithless
sand
to
stem
too
rapid
and
too
deep
to
stand
if
here
i
enter
my
efforts
are
vain
dash
on
the
cliffs
or
heaved
into
the
main
or
round
the
island
if
my
course
i
bend
where
the
ports
open
or
the
shores
descend
back
to
the
seas
the
rolling
surge
may
sweep
and
bury
all
my
hopes
beneath
the
deep
or
some
enormous
whale
the
god
may
send
for
many
such
an
amphitrite
attend
too
well
the
turns
of
mortal
chance
i
know
and
hate
relentless
of
my
heavenly
foe
while
thus
he
thought
a
monstrous
wave
upbore
the
chief
and
dash
him
on
the
craggy
shore
torn
was
his
skin
nor
had
the
ribs
been
whole
but
instant
pallas
enter
in
his
soul
close
to
the
cliff
with
both
his
hands
he
clung
and
stuck
adherent
and
suspended
hung
till
the
huge
surge
roll
off
then
backward
sweep
the
refluent
tides
and
plunge
him
in
the
deep
as
when
the
polypus
from
forth
his
cave
torn
with
full
force
reluctant
beats
the
wave
his
ragged
claws
are
stuck
with
stones
and
sands
so
the
rough
rock
had
shagg
ulysses
hands
and
now
had
perish
whelm
beneath
the
main
the
unhappy
man
fate
had
been
in
vain
but
pallas
lent
her
power
and
prudence
saved
him
in
the
needful
hour
beyond
the
beating
surge
his
course
he
bore
a
wider
circle
but
in
sight
of
shore
with
longing
eyes
observing
to
survey
some
smooth
ascent
or
safe
sequester
bay
between
the
parting
rocks
at
length
he
spied
a
failing
stream
with
gentler
waters
glide
where
to
the
seas
the
shelving
shore
declined
and
form
a
bay
impervious
to
the
wind
to
this
calm
port
the
glad
ulysses
press
and
hail
the
river
and
its
god
address
thou
art
before
whose
stream
unknown
i
bend
a
suppliant
at
thy
watery
throne
hear
azure
king
nor
let
me
fly
in
vain
to
thee
from
neptune
and
the
raging
main
heaven
hears
and
pities
hapless
men
like
me
for
sacred
even
to
gods
is
misery
let
then
thy
waters
give
the
weary
rest
and
save
a
suppliant
and
a
man
distress
he
pray
and
straight
the
gentle
stream
subsides
detains
the
rushing
current
of
his
tides
before
the
wanderer
smooths
the
watery
way
and
soft
receives
him
from
the
rolling
sea
that
moment
fainting
as
he
touch
the
shore
he
dropp
his
sinewy
arms
his
knees
no
more
perform
their
office
or
his
weight
upheld
his
swoln
heart
heaved
his
bloated
body
swell
from
mouth
and
nose
the
briny
torrent
ran
and
lost
in
lassitude
lay
all
the
man
deprived
of
voice
of
motion
and
of
breath
the
soul
scarce
waking
in
the
arms
of
death
soon
as
warm
life
its
wonted
office
found
the
mindful
chief
leucothea
scarf
unbound
observant
of
her
word
he
turn
aside
his
head
and
cast
it
on
the
rolling
tide
behind
him
far
upon
the
purple
waves
the
waters
waft
it
and
the
nymph
receives
now
parting
from
the
stream
ulysses
found
a
mossy
bank
with
pliant
rushes
crown
the
bank

press
and
gently
kiss
the
ground
where
on
the
flowery
herb
as
soft
he
lay
thus
to
his
soul
the
sage
began
to
say
what
will
ye
next
ordain
ye
powers
on
high
and
yet
ah
yet
what
fates
are
we
to
try
here
by
the
stream
if
i
the
night
thus
spent
already
how
shall
nature
bear
the
dews
descending
and
nocturnal
air
or
chilly
vapours
breathing
from
the
flood
when
morning
rises
if
i
take
the
wood
and
in
thick
shelter
of
innumerous
boughs
enjoy
the
comfort
gentle
sleep
allows
though
fenced
from

though
my
toil
be
pass

savage

may
wander
in
the

perhaps
i
yet
may
fall
a
bloody
prey
to
prowling
bears
or
lions
in
the
way
thus
long
debating
in
himself
he
stood
at
length
he
took
the
passage
to
the
wood
whose
shady
horrors
on
a
rising
brow
waved
high
and
frown
upon
the

below
there
grew

attend
an

ogygia
named
in

watery
arms
where
dwells
calypso
dreadful
in

remote
from

she
holds
her
reign
amid
the
terrors
of
a
rolling
main
me
only
me
the
hand
of
fortune
bore
unblest
to
tread
that
interdicted
shore
when
jove
tremendous
in
the
sable
deeps
launch
his
red
lightning
at
our
scattered
ships
then
all
my
fleet
and
all
my
followers
lost
sole
on
a
plank
on
boiling
surges
toss
heaven
drove
my
wreck
the
ogygian
isle
to
find
full
nine
days
floating
to
the
wave
and
wind
met
by
the
goddess
there
with
open
arms
she
bribed
my
stay
with
more
than
human
charms
nay
promised
vainly
promised
to
bestow
immortal
life
exempt
from
age
and
woe
but
all
her
blandishments
successless
prove
to
banish
from
my
breast
my
country
love
i
stay
reluctant
seven
continued
years
and
water
her
ambrosial
couch
with
tears
the
eighth
she
voluntary
moves
to
part
or
urged
by
jove
or
her
own
changeful
heart
a
raft
was
formed
to
cross
the
surging
sea
herself
supplied
the
stores
and
rich
array
and
gave
the
gales
to
waft
me
on
my
way
in
seventeen
days
appear
your
pleasing
coast
and
woody
mountains
half
in
vapours
lost
joy
touched
my
soul
my
soul
was
joy
in
vain
for
angry
neptune
roused
the
raging
main
the
wild
winds
whistle
and
the
billows
roar
the
splitting
raft
the
furious
tempest
tore
and
storms
vindictive
intercept
the
shore
soon
as
their
rage
subsides
the
seas
i
brave
with
naked
force
and
shoot
along
the
wave
to
reach
this
isle
but
there
my
hopes
were
lost
the
surge
impell
me
on
a
craggy
coast
i
chose
the
safer
sea
and
chanced
to
find
a
river
mouth
impervious
to
the
wind
and
clear
of
rocks
i
fainted
by
the
flood
then
took
the
shelter
of
the
neighbouring
wood
was
night
and
covered
in
the
foliage
deep
jove
plunged
my
senses
in
the
death
of
sleep
all
night
i
slept
oblivious
of
my
pain
aurora
dawned
and
phoebus
shined
in
vain
nor
till
oblique
he
sloped
his
evening
ray
had
somnus
dried
the
balmy
dews
away
then
female
voices
from
the
shore
i
heard
a
maid
amidst
them
appear
to
her
i
sued
she
pitied
my
distress
like
thee
in
beauty
nor
in
virtue
less
who
from
such
youth
could
hope
considerate
care
in
youth
and
beauty
wisdom
is
but
rare
she
gave
me
life
relieved
with
just
supplies
my
wants
and
lent
these
robes
that
strike
your
eyes
this
is
the
truth
and
oh
ye
powers
on
high
forbid

we
boldly
landed
on
the
hostile
place
and
sack
the
city
and
destroy
the
race
their
wives
made
captive
their
possessions
shared
and
every
soldier
found
a
like
reward
i
then
advised
to
fly
not

the

who
stay
to

the

sad
for

joyful
of

yet
as

two

i

dear
associates
here
indulge
your

while
with

adventurous
i
go
forth
the
manners
of
you
men
to
try
whether
a

unjust

barbarous
might
rude

unconscious
of

who
harbour

revere

untied

on

they
sweep
neptune

cleave
the
yielding
deep
when
to
the
nearest
verge
of
land
we
drew
fast
by
the
sea
a
lonely
cave
we
view
high
and
with
darkening
laurels
covered
were
sheep

lay
slumbering
round
the

near

brown
with

a

shepherd
here
his

maintains
far
from

and
solitary
reigns
in
shelter
thick
of
horrid
shade
reclined
and
gloomy
mischiefs
labour
in
his
mind
a
form
enormous
far
unlike
the
race
of
human
birth
in
stature
or
in

as
some
lone
mountain
monstrous
growth
he
stood
crown
with
rough
thickets
and
a
nodding
wood
i
left
my

at
the

our

command
with
only
twelve
the
boldest

then
took

that
held
a

now
some

the

my

foreboded
i
should
find
the
bower
of
some
fell
monster
fierce
with
barbarous

some
rustic

lived
in

despite
contemning

hence

my

me

to
quit

drive
a

our

put
off
to

their

rashly
i
declined

to

the

try
what

a

dire
rites
alas

fatal
to

then
first
a

we
kindle
and
prepare
for

with

and
prayer
the

us
full
repast
we
sit
expecting
lo
he
comes
at

near
half
a

on

he
bore
and
cast
the
ponderous
burden
at
the
door
it

fell
we
trembled
then
and
sought
the
deep

wrongs
that
ye
are
the
savage
thus
replies
his
inward
fury
blazing
at
his
eyes
or
strangers
distant
far
from
our
abodes
to
bid
me
reverence
or
regard
the
gods
know
then
we
cyclops
are
a
race
above
those
people
and
their
jove
and
learn
our
power
proceeds
with
thee
and
thine
not
as
he
wills
but
as
ourselves
incline
but
answer
the
good
ship
that
brought
ye
where
lies
she
anchor
near
or
off
the
shore
thus
he
his
meditated
fraud
i
find
versed
in
the
turns
of
various
and
cautious
thus
a
dreadful
rock
fast
by
your
shore
the
gallant
vessel
broke
scarce
with
these
few
i
of
all
my
train
whom
angry
neptune
whelm
beneath
the
main
the
scattered
wreck
the
winds
blew
back
again
he
answer
with
his
deed
his
bloody
hand
snatch
two
unhappy
of
my
martial
band
and
dash
like
dogs
against
the
stony
floor
the
pavement
swims
with
brains
and
mingled
gore
torn
limb
from
limb
he
spreads
his
horrid
feast
and
fierce
devours
it
like
a
mountain
beast
he
sucks
the
marrow
and
the
blood
he
drains
nor
entrails
flesh
nor
solid
bone
remains
we
see
the
death
from
which
we
can
not
move
and
humbled
groan
beneath
the
hand
of
jove
his
ample
maw
with
human
carnage
fill
a
milky
deluge
next
the
giant
swill
then
stretch
in
length
half
the
cavern
rock
lay
senseless
and
supine
amidst
the
flock
to
seize
the
time
and
with
a
sudden
wound
to
fix
the
slumbering
monster
to
the
ground
my
soul
impels
me
and
in
act
i
stand
to
draw
the
sword
but
wisdom
held
my
hand
a
deed
so
rash
had
finished
all
our
fate
no
mortal
forces
from
the
lofty
gate
could
roll
the
rock
in
hopeless
grief
we
lay
and
sigh
expecting
the
return
of
day
now
did
the
morn
arise
and
shed
her
sacred
light
along
the
skies
he
wakes
he
lights
the
fire
he
milks
the
dams
and
to
the
mother
teats
submits
the
lambs
the
task
thus
finish
of
his
morning
hours
two
more
he
snatches
murders
and
devours
then
pleased
and
whistling
drives
his
flock
before
removes
the
rocky
mountain
from
the
door
and
shuts
again
with
equal
ease
disposed
as
a
light
quiver
lid
is
oped
and
closed
his
giant
voice
the
echoing
region
fills
his
flocks
obedient
spread
all
the
hills
thus
left
behind
even
in
the
last
despair
i
thought
devised
and
pallas
heard
my
prayer
revenge
and
doubt
and
caution
work
my
breast
but
this
of
many
counsels
seem
the
best
the
monster
club
within
the
cave
i
spied
a
tree
of
stateliest
growth
and
yet
undried
green
from
the
wood
of
height
and
bulk
so
vast
the
largest
ship
might
claim
it
for
a
mast
this
shorten
of
its
top
i
gave
my
train
a
fathom
length
to
shape
it
and
to
plane
the
narrower
end
i
sharpen
to
a
spire
whose
point
we
harden
with
the
force
of
fire
and
hid
it
in
the
dust
that
strew
the
cave
then
to
my
few
companions
bold
and
brave
proposed
who
first
the
venturous
deed
should
try
in
the
broad
orbit
of
his
monstrous
eye
to
plunge
the
brand
and
twirl
the
pointed
wood
when
slumber
next
should
tame
the
man
of
blood
just
as
i
wished
the
lots
were
cast
on
four
myself
the
fifth
we
stand
and
wait
the
hour
he
comes
with
evening
all
his
fleecy
flock
before
him
march
and
pour
into
the
rock
not
one
or
male
or
female
stayed
behind
so
fortune
chanced
or
so
some
god
designed
then
heaving
high
the
stone
unwieldy
weight
he
roll
it
on
the
cave
and
closed
the
gate
first
down
he
sits
to
milk
the
woolly
dams
and
then
permits
their
udder
to
the
lambs
next
seized
two
wretches
more
and
headlong
cast
brain
on
the
rock
his
second
dire
repast
i
then
approach
him
reeking
with
their
gore
and
held
the
brimming
goblet
foaming
since
human
flesh
has
been
thy
feast
now
drain
this
goblet
potent
to
digest
know
hence
what
treasures
in
our
ship
we
lost
and
what
rich
liquors
other
climates
boast
we
to
thy
shore
the
precious
freight
shall
bear
if
home
thou
send
us
and
vouchsafe
to
spare
but
oh
thus
furious
thirsting
thus
for
gore
the
sons
of
men
shall
approach
thy
shore
and
never
shalt
thou
taste
this
nectar
more
he
heard
he
took
and
pouring
down
his
throat
delighted
swill
the
large
luxurious
draught
give
me
more
he
cried
the
boon
be
thine
thou
art
that
celestial
wine
declare
thy
name
not
mortal
is
this
juice
such
as
the
unbless
cyclopaean
climes
produce
though
sure
our
vine
the
largest
cluster
yields
and
jove
scorn
thunder
serves
to
drench
our
fields
but
this
descended
from
the
bless
abodes
a
rill
of
nectar
streaming
from
the
gods
he
said
and
greedy
grasped
the
heady
bowl
thrice
drained
and
poured
the
deluge
on
his
soul
his
sense
lay
covered
with
the
dozy
fume
while
thus
my
fraudful
speech
i
reassume
promised
boon
o
cyclop
now
i
claim
and
plead
my
title
noman
is
my
name
by
that
distinguish
from
my
tender
years
what
my
parents
call
me
and
my
peers
the
giant
then
promis
grace
receive
the
hospitable
boon
we
mean
to
give
when
all
thy
wretched
crew
have
felt
my
power
noman
shall
be
the
last
i
will
devour
he
said
then
nodding
with
the
fumes
of
wine
droop
his
huge
head
and
snoring
lay
supine
his
neck
obliquely
his
shoulders
hung
press
with
the
weight
of
sleep
that
tames
the
strong
there
belch
the
mingled
streams
of
wine
and
blood
and
human
flesh
his
indigested
food
sudden
i
stir
the
embers
and
inspire
with
animating
breath
the
seeds
of
fire
each
drooping
spirit
with
bold
words
repair
and
urged
my
train
the
dreadful
deed
to
dare
the
stake
now
glow
beneath
the
burning
bed
green
as
it
was
and
sparkled
fiery
red
then
forth
the
vengeful
instrument
i
bring
with
beating
hearts
my
fellows
form
a
ring
urged
my
some
present
god
they
swift
let
fall
the
pointed
torment
on
his
visual
ball
myself
above
them
from
a
rising
ground
guide
the
sharp
stake
and
twirl
it
round
and
round
as
when
a
shipwright
stands
his
workmen
who
ply
the
wimble
some
huge
beam
to
bore
urged
on
all
hands
it
nimbly
spins
about
the
grain
till
it
scoops
it
out
in
his
broad
eye
he
whirls
the
fiery
wood
from
the
pierced
pupil
spouts
the
boiling
blood
singed
are
his
brows
the
scorching
lids
grow
black
the
jelly
bubbles

fibres
crack
and
as
when
armourers
temper
in
the
ford
the
or
the
shining
sword
the
metal
hisses
in
the
lake
thus
in
his
hiss
the
plunging
stake
he
sends
a
dreadful
groan
the
rocks
around
through
all
their
inmost
winding
caves
resound
scared
we
recoiled
forth
with
frantic
hand
he
tore
and
dash
on
earth
and
gory
brand
then
calls
the
cyclops
all
that
round
him

with
voice
like
thunder
and

direful
yell
from
all
their
dens
the
race

from
rifted

at
his
roar

the
cyclop
raging
with
his

searches
round

round
at

the
stone
removing
from
the
gate
with

ere

as

still
folded
with
distended
thighs

bleating
in
distressful
cries

heedless
of

anguish
stung

my
hands
did
from
the
rudder
part
so
much
the
love
of
home
possess
my
heart
when
lo
on
board
a
fond
debate
arose
what
rare
device
those
vessels
might
inclose
what
sum
what
prize
from
aeolus
i
brought
whilst
to
his
neighbour
each
express
his
thought
whence
ye
gods
contending
nations
strive
who
most
shall
please
who
most
our
hero
give
long
have
his
coffers
groan
with
trojan
spoils
whilst
we
the
wretched
partners
of
his
toils
reproach
by
want
our
fruitless
labours
mourn
and
only
rich
in
barren
fame
return
now
aeolus
ye
see
augments
his
store
but
come
my
friends
these
mystic
gifts
explore
they
said
and
oh
cursed
fate
the
thongs
unbound
the
gushing
tempest
sweeps
the
ocean
round
snatch
in
the
whirl
the
hurried
navy
flew
the
ocean
widen
and
the
shores
withdrew
roused
from
my
fatal
sleep
i
long
debate
if
still
to
live
or
desperate
plunge
to
fate
thus
doubting
prostrate
on
the
deck
i
lay
till
all
the
coward
thoughts
of
death
gave
way
meanwhile
our
vessels
plough
the
liquid
plain
and
soon
the
known
aeolian
coast
regain
our
groan
the
rocks
remurmur
to
the
main
we
leap
on
shore
and
with
a
scanty
feast
our
thirst
and
hunger
hastily
repress
that
done
two
chosen
heralds
straight
attend
our
second
progress
to
my
royal
friend
and
him
amidst
his
jovial
sons
we
found
the
banquet
steaming
and
the
goblets
crown
there
humbly
stoop
with
conscious
shame
and
awe
nor
nearer
than
the
gate
presumed
to
draw
but
soon
his
sons
their
guest
descried
and
starting
from
their
couches
loudly
cried
here
what
demon
thou
meet
to
thwart
thy
passage
and
repel
thy
fleet
wast
thou
not
furnish
by
our
choicest
care
for
greece
for
home
and
all
thy
soul
held
dear
thus
they
in
silence
long
my
fate
i
mourn
at
length
these
words
with
accents
low
return
lock
in
sleep
my
faithless
crew
bereft
of
all
the
blessing
of
your
godlike
gift
but
grant
oh
grant
our
loss
we
may
retrieve
a
favour
you
and
you
alone
can
give
thus
i
with
art
to
move
their
pity
tried
and
touch
the
youths
but
their
stern
sire
replied
wretch
begone
this
instant
i
command
thy
fleet
accursed
to
leave
our
hallow
land
his
baneful
suit
pollutes
these
bless
abodes
whose
fate
proclaims
him
hateful
to
the
gods
thus
fierce
he
said
we
sighing
went
our
way
and
with
desponding
hearts
put
off
to
sea
the
sailors
spent
with
toils
their
folly
mourn
but
mourn
in
vain
no
prospect
of
return
six
days
and
nights
a
doubtful
course
we
steer
the
next
proud
lamos
stately
towers
appear
and
laestrygonia
gates
arise
distinct
in
air
the
shepherd
quitting
here
at
night
the
plain
calls
to
succeed
his
cares
the
watchful
swain
but
he
that
scorns
the
chains
of
sleep
to
wear
and
adds
the
herdsman
to
the
shepherd
care
so
near
the
pastures
and
so
short
the
way
his
double
toils
may
claim
a
double
pay
and
join
the
labours
of
the
night
and
day
within
a
long
recess
a
bay
there
lies
edged
round
with
cliffs
high
pointing
to
the
skies
the
jutting
shores
that
swell
on
either
side
contract
its
mouth
and
break
the
rushing
tide
our
eager
sailors
seize
the
fair
retreat
and
bound
within
the
port
their
crowded
fleet
for
here
retired
the
sinking
billows

and
smiling
calmness
silver
the
deep
i
only
in
the
bay
refused
to
moor
and
fix
without
my
halsers
to
the
shore
from
thence
we
climb
a
point
whose
airy
brow
commands
the
prospect
of
the
plains
below
no
tracks
of
beasts
or
signs
of
men
we
found
but
smoky
volumes
rolling
from
the
ground
two
with
our
herald
thither
we
command
with
speed
to
learn
what
men
possess
the
land
they
went
and
kept
the
wheel
road
which
to
the
city
drew
the
mountain
wood
when
lo
they
met
beside
a
crystal
spring
the
daughter
of
antiphates
the
king
she
to
artacia
silver
streams
came
down
artacia
streams
alone
supply
the
town
the
damsel
they
approach
and
ask
what
race
the
people
were
who
monarch
of
the
place
with
joy
the
maid
the
unwary
strangers
heard
and
show
them
where
the
royal
dome
appear
they
went
but
as
they
entering
saw
the
queen
of
size
enormous
and
terrific
mien
not
yielding
to
some
bulky
mountain
height
a
sudden
horror
struck
their
aching
sight
swift
at
her
call
her
husband
scour
away
to
wreak
his
hunger
on
the
destined
prey
one
for
his
food
the
raging
glutton
slew
but
two
rush
out
and
to
the
navy
flew
balk
of
his
prey
the
yelling
monster
flies
and
fills
the
city
with
his
hideous
cries
a
ghastly
band
of
giants
hear
the
roar
and
pouring
down
the
mountains
crowd
the
shore
fragments
they
rend
from
off
the
craggy
brow
and
dash
the
ruins
on
the
ships
below
the
crackling
vessels
burst
hoarse
groans
arise
and
mingled
horrors
echo
to
the
skies
the
men
like
fish
they
struck
upon
the
flood
and
cramm
their
filthy
throats
with
human
food
whilst
thus
their
fury
rages
at
the
bay
my
sword
our
cables
cut
i
call
to
weigh
and
charged
my
men
as
they
from
fate
would
fly
each
nerve
to
strain
each
bending
oar
to
ply
the
sailors
catch
the
word
their
oars
they
seize
and
sweep
with
equal
strokes
the
smoky
seas
clear
of
the
rocks
the
impatient
vessel
flies
whilst
in
the
port
each
wretch
encumber
dies
with
earnest
haste
my
frighted
sailors
press
while
kindling
transports
glow
at
our
success
but
the
sad
fate
that
did
our
friends
destroy
cool
every
breast
and
damp
the
rising
joy
now
dropp
our
anchors
in
the
aeaean
bay
where
circe
dwelt
the
daughter
of
the
day
her
mother
perse
of
old
ocean
strain
thus
from
the
lun
descended
and
the
main
from
the
same
lineage
stern
aeaetes
came
the
brother
of
the
enchantress
dame
goddess
the
queen
to
whom
the
powers
belong
of
dreadful
magic
and
commanding
song
some
god
directing
to
this
peaceful
bay
silent
we
came
and
melancholy
lay
spent
and
two
days
and
nights
roll
on
and
now
the
third
succeeding
morning
shone
i
climb
a
cliff
with
spear
and
sword
in
hand
whose
ridge
a
shady
length
of
land
to
learn
if
aught
of
mortal
works
appear
or
cheerful
voice
of
mortal
strike
the
ear
from
the
high
point
i
mark
in
distant
view
a
stream
of
curling
smoke
ascending
blue
and
spiry
tops
the
tufted
trees
above
of
circe
palace
bosom
in
the
grove
thither
to
haste
the
region
to
explore
was
first
my
thought
but
speeding
back
to
shore
i
deem
it
best
to
visit
first
my
crew
and
send
our
spies
the
dubious
coast
to
view
as
down
the
hill
i
solitary
go
some
power
divine
who
pities
human
woe
sent
a
tall
stag
descending
from
the
wood
to
cool
his
fervour
in
the
crystal
flood
luxuriant
on
the
bank
he
lay
stretch
forth
and
panting
in
the
sunny
ray
i
launch
my
spear
and
with
a
sudden
wound
transpierced
his
back
and
fix
him
to
the
ground
he
falls
and
mourns
his
fate
with
human
cries
through
the
wide
wound
the
vital
spirit
flies
i
drew
and
casting
on
the
river
side
the
bloody
spear
his
gather
feet
i
tied
with
twining
osiers
which
the
bank
supplied
an
ell
in
length
the
pliant
wisp
i
weaved
and
the
huge
body
on
my
shoulders
heaved
then
leaning
on
my
spear
with
both
my
hands
upbore
my
load
and
press
the
sinking
sands
with
weighty
steps
till
at
the
ship
i
threw
the
welcome
burden
and
bespoke
my
crew
up
my
friends
it
is
not
yet
our
fate
to
glide
with
ghosts
through
pluto
gloomy
gate
food
in
the
desert
land
behold
is
given
live
and
enjoy
the
providence
of
heaven
the
joyful
crew
survey
his
mighty
size
and
on
the
future
banquet
feast
their
eyes
as
huge
in
length
extended
lay
the
beast
then
wash
their
hands
and
hasten
to
the
feast
there
till
the
setting
sun
roll
down
the
light
they
sate
indulging
in
the
genial
rite
when
evening
rose
and
darkness
cover
the
face
of
things
we
slept
along
the
shore
but
when
the
rosy
morning
warm
the
east
my
men
i
summon
and
these
words
address
and
friends
attend
what
i
propose
ye
sad
companions
of
ulysses
woes
we
know
not
here
what
land
before
us
lies
or
to
what
quarter
now
we
turn
our
eyes
or
where
the
sun
shall
set
or
where
shall
rise
here
let
us
think
if
thinking
be
not
vain
if
any
counsel
any
hope
remain
alas
from
yonder
promontory
brow
i
view
the
coast
a
region
flat
and
low
an
isle
encircled
with
the
boundless
flood
a
length
of
thickets
and
entangled
wood
some
smoke
i
saw
amid
the
forest
rise
and
all
around
it
only
seas
and
skies
with
broken
hearts
my
sad
companions
stood
mindful
of
cyclops
and
his
human
food
and
horrid
laestrygons
the
men
of
blood
presaging
tears
apace
began
to
rain
but
tears
in
mortal
miseries
are
vain
in
equal
parts
i
straight
divide
my
band
and
name
a
chief
each
party
to
command
i
led
the
one
and
of
the
other
side
appointed
brave
eurylochus
the
guide
then
in
the
brazen
helm
the
lots
we
throw
and
fortune
casts
eurylochus
to
go
he
march
with
twice
eleven
in
his
train
pensive
they
march
and
pensive
we
remain
the
palace
in
a
woody
vale
they
found
high
raised
of
stone
a
shaded
space
around
where
mountain
wolves
and
brindled
lions
roam
by
magic
tamed
familiar
to
the
dome
with
gentle
blandishment
our
men
they
meet
and
wag
their
tails
and
fawning
lick
their
feet
as
from
some
feast
a
man
returning
late
his
faithful
dogs
all
meet
him
at
the
gate
rejoicing
round
some
morsel
to
receive
such
as
the
good
man
ever
used
to
give
domestic
thus
the
grisly
beasts
drew
near
they
gaze
with
wonder
not
unmix
with
fear
now
on
the
threshold
of
the
dome
they
stood
and
heard
a
voice
resounding
through
the
wood
placed
at
her
loom
within
the
goddess
sung
the
vaulted
roofs
and
solid
pavement
rung
the

a
gallant
leader
and
a

celestial
chanting
to
the

or
nymph
or

echoes
from
the
room
say
shall
we
seek
access
with
that
they
call
and
wide
unfold
the

of
the

the
goddess
rising
asks
her

to

soon
in

instant
her

no

the

bristle
into
swine
still
cursed
with
sense
their

remain
alone
and

them
when
they
groan
meanwhile
the

in
disdain
bestows
the

brutal
food
and
strows
the

their

on
unsavoury

eurylochus
with

aghast
returns
the

of
woe

bitter
fate
to

in

essay
nor

his

obey
his
swelling
heart
denied
the

but
speaking
tears
the
want
of

supply
and
the
full
soul
bursts
copious
from
his

affrighted
anxious
for

we
press
to
hear
what
sadly
he
relates
we
went
ulysses
such
was
thy
command
through
the
lone
thicket
and
the
desert
land
a
palace
in
a
woody
vale
we
found
brown
with
dark
forests
and
with
shades
around
a
voice
celestial
echoed
through
the

chanting

my

flung
the

in

my

then
seized
the

again
as
from

at

when
the

came
on
at

and
all
lay
slumbering
in

i
came
a

to

then
she
cried
ah

the

tears
in

sadly
they
fared
along
the
shore
still
heaved
their
hearts
and
still
their

ran
the

victims
at
our
bark
we
found
the

together
bound
for

allows
time
for

for
soft
repose
if
scenes
of

can
entertain

i
unfold

prepare
to
heir
of

of

thus
by

the

thick
as

in

her
on

when
hand
to
hand
they
wound
return
for
wound
but
never
have
the
eyes
astonish
so
vile
a
deed
so
dire
a
scene
of
blood
in
the
flow
of
joy
when
now
the
bowl
glows
in
our
veins
and
opens
every
soul
we
groan
we
faint
with
blood
the
doom
is
dyed
and
the
pavement
floats
the
dreadful
tide
her
breast
all
gore
with
lamentable
cries
the
bleeding
innocent
cassandra
dies
then
though
pale
death
froze
cold
in
every
vein
my
sword
i
strive
to
wield
but
strive
in
vain
nor
did
my
traitress

these

close

decently
in
death
my
limbs
compose
o
woman
woman
when
to
ill
thy
mind
is
bent
all
hell
contains
no
fouler
fiend
and
such
was
mine
who
basely
plunged
her
sword
through
the
fond
bosom
where
she
reign
adored
alas
i
hoped
the
toils
of
war
to
meet
soft
quiet
and
repose
at

delusive
hope
o

thy
deeds
disgrace
the
perjured
sex
and
blacken
all
the
race
and
should
posterity
one
virtuous
find
name
clytemnestra
they
will
curse
the
kind
oh
injured
shade
i
cried
what
mighty
woes
to
thy
imperial
race
from
woman
rose
by
woman
here
thou
this
mournful
strand
and
greece
by
woman
lies
a
desert
land
by
my
ills
beware
the
shade
replies
nor
trust
the
sex
that
is
so
rarely
wise
when
earnest
to
explore
thy
secret
breast
unfold
some
trifle
but
conceal
the
rest
but
in
thy
consort
cease
to
fear
a
foe
for
thee
she
feels
sincerity
of
woe
when
troy
first
bled
beneath
the
grecian
arms
she
shone
unrivall
with
a
blaze
of
charms
thy
infant
son
her
fragrant
bosom
press
hung
at
her
knee
or
wanton
at
her
breast
but
now
the
years
a
numerous
train
have
ran
the
blooming
boy
is
ripen
into
man
thy
eyes
shall
see
him
burn
with
noble
fire
the
sire
shall
bless
his
son
the
son
his
sire
but
my
orestes
never
met
these
eyes
without
one
look
the
murder
father
dies
then
from
a
wretched
friend
this
wisdom
learn
to
thy
queen
disguised
unknown
return
for
since
of
womankind
so
few
are
just
think
all
are
false
nor
the
faithful
trust
say
resides
my
son
in
royal
port
in
rich
orchomenos
or
sparta
court
or
say
in
pyle
for
yet
he
views
the
light
nor
glides
a

through
the

of

then
i
suit
is
vain
nor
can
i

if
yet
he
breathes
in

these

truth
i
revere
for

never
lies
thus
in
a

of

our
sorrows
flow
and
add
new
horror
to
the

of

till

the

walk
eternal
rounds
nor

with

pass
these

no

the

fisher
casts
the
insidious

with
fraudful

he
waits
the
finny
prize
and
sudden
lifts
it
quivering
to
the
skies
so
the
foul
monster
lifts
her
prey
on
high
so
pant
the
wretches
struggling
in

in

dungeon
she
devours
her

trembles

with

never

never

aghast
i
stood
a

of

now
from
the

the

flies
and
the

thunder
dies
to

rise

sacred

suddenly
was
heard
along

main
to
low
the
ox
to
blest
the
woolly
train
straight
to
my
anxious
thoughts
the
sound
the
words
of
circe
and
the

shade
warn
by
their
awful

these

to

what

the

some
mighty
woe
relentless
heaven
forebodes
fly
these

the

while
yet
i
spoke
a
sudden
sorrow
ran
through
every
breast
and
spread
from
man
to
man
till
wrathful
thus
eurylochus
began
cruel
thou
some
fury
sure
has
that
stubborn
soul
by

untaught
to

to

thou
a

still
must
we
restless
rove
new

explore
the
sun
descending
and
so
near
the
shore
and
lo
the
night
begins
her
groomy
reign
and
doubles
all
the
terrors
of
the
main
oft
in
the
dead
of
night
loud
winds
rise
lash
the
wild
surge
and
bluster
in
the
skies
oh
should
the
fierce
his
rage
display
and
toss
with
rising
storms
the
watery
way
though
gods
descend
from
heaven
aerial
plain
to
lend
us

the

descend
in

while
the

displays

ye
to

and
when
the
morning
ray
sheds
her
bright
beam
pursue
the

a
sudden
joy
in

rose
so
will
some
demon
minister
of
woes
to

with
grief
swift
to
be
undone
constrain
i
act
what
wisdom
bids
me
shun
but
yonder
herbs
and
yonder
flocks
forbear
attest
the
heavens
and
call
the
gods
to
hear
content
an
innocent
repast
display
by
circe
given
and
fly
the
dangerous
prey
i
and
while
to
shore
the
vessel
flies
with
hands
uplifted
they
attest
the
skies
then
where
a
fountain
gurgling
waters
play
they
rush
to
land
and
end
in
feasts
the
day
they
feed
they
quaff
and
now
their
hunger
fled
sigh
for
their
friends
devour
and
mourn
the
dead
nor
cease
the
tears
till
each
in
slumber
shares
a
sweet
forgetfulness
of
human
cares
now
far
the
night
advanced
her
gloomy
reign
and
setting
stars
roll
down
the
azure
plain
when
at
the
voice
of
jove
wild
whirlwinds
rise
and
clouds
and
double
darkness
veil
the
skies
the
moon
the
stars
the
bright
ethereal
host
seem
as
extinct
and
all
their
splendours
lost
the
furious
tempest
roars
with
dreadful
sound
air
thunders
rolls
the
ocean
groans
the
ground
all
night
it
raged
when
morning
rose
to
land
we
haul
our
bark
and
moor
it
on
the
strand
where
in
a
beauteous
grotto
cool
recess
dance
the
green
nerolds
of
the
neighbouring
seas
there
while
the
wild
winds
whistled
the
main
thus
careful
i
address
the
listening
train
friends
be
wise
nor
dare
the
flocks
destroy
of
these
fair
pastures
if
ye
touch
ye

warn
by
the
high
command
of
heaven
be
awed
holy
the

dreadful
is
the
god
that
god
who
spreads
the
radiant
beams
of
light
and
views
wide
earth
and
heaven
unmeasured
height
and
now
the
moon
had
run
her
monthly
round
the
blustering
with
a
dreadful
sound
unhurt
the
beeves
untouch
the
woolly
train
low
through
the
grove
or
touch
the
flowery
plain
then
fail
our

then
fish
we
make
our
prey
or
fowl
that
screaming
haunt
the
watery
way
till
now
from
sea
or
flood
no
succour
found
famine
and
meagre
want
besieged
us
round
pensive
and
pale
from
grove
to
grove
i
stray
from
the
loud
storms
to
find
a
sylvan
shade
there
my
hands
the
living
wave
i
pour
and
heaven
and
heaven
immortal
thrones
implore
to
calm
the
roarings
of
the
stormy
main
and
guide
me
peaceful
to
my
realms
again
then
my
eyes
the
gods
soft
slumbers
shed
while
thus
eurylochus
arising
said
friends
a
thousand
ways
frail
mortals
lead
to
the
cold
tomb
and
dreadful
all
to
tread
but
dreadful
most
when
by
a
slow
decay
pale
hunger
wastes
the
manly
strength
away
why
cease
ye
then
to
implore
the
powers
above
and
offer
hecatombs
to
thundering
jove
why
seize
ye
not
yon
beeves
and
fleecy
prey
arise
unanimous
arise
and
slay
and
if
the
gods
ordain
a
safe
return
to
phoebus
shrines
shall
rise
and
altars
burn
but
should
the
powers
that
mankind
preside
decree
to
plunge
us
in
the
whelming
tide
better
to
rush
at
once
to
shades
below
than
linger
life
away
and
nourish
woe
thus
he
the
beeves
around
securely
stray
when
swift
to
ruin
they
invade
the
prey
they
seize
they
kill
but
for
the
rite
divine
the
barley
fail
and
for
libations
wine
swift
from
the
oak
they
strip
the
shady
pride
and
verdant
leaves
the
flowery
cake
supplied
with
prayer
they
now
address
the
ethereal
train
slay
the
selected
beeves
and
flay
the
slain
the
thighs
with
fat
involved

with
art
strew
with
morsels
cut
from
every
part
water
instead
of
wine
is
brought
in
urns
and
pour
profanely
as
the
victim
burns
the
thighs
thus
offer
and
the
entrails
dress
they
roast
the
fragments
and
prepare
the
feast
was
then
soft
slumber
fled
my
troubled
brain
back
to
the
bark
i
speed
along
the
main
when
lo
an
odour
from
the
feast
exhales
spreads
the
coast
and
scents
the
tainted
gales
a
chilly
fear
congeal
my
vital
blood
and
thus
obtesting
heaven
i
mourn
aloud
sire
of
men

immortal
jove
o
all
ye
blissful
powers
that
reign
above
why
were
my
cares
beguiled
in
short
repose
o
fatal
slumber
paid
with
lasting
woes
a
deed
so
dreadful
all
the
gods
alarms
vengeance
is
on
the
wing
and
heaven
in
arms
meantime
lampetie
mounts
the
aerial

and
kindles
into
rage
the

of

ye

cries
and
then
whose

aims
the

bolt
and
hurls
the
writhen

slain

those

which
i
with
pride
survey

the

loosed
from

the
impelling
gales
past
sight
of

along
the

we
bound
and
all

all
around
when
lo
a
murky
cloud
the
thunderer
forms
full
our

and
blackens
heaven
with
storms
night
dwells
all
the

and
now
outflies
the
gloomy
west
and
whistles
in
the

the
roar
the
furious
blast
howls
the

rends
it
from

the

tell
me
whence
thou
art

what
the

of

wanderings
thou

he
said
and
seconding
the

request
with

thus

in

some

these
no

some
oracle
explore

to

to

betrays
the
tongue
to
lie
each
vagrant
traveller
that

deludes
with
fallacies
the
royal
ear
to
dear
remembrance
makes
his
image
rise
and
calls
the
springing
sorrows
from
her
eyes
such
thou
mayst
be
but
he
whose
name
you
crave
moulders
in

on

his

he

never

my

and
to
what

i
owe
the

thus
he
and
thus
with
prompt
invention
bold
the
cautious
chief
his
ready
story
told
on
dark
reserve
what
better
can
prevail

from

produce
the

than
when
two

alone
in

confer

most

till
the
whole

not
the
whole

of

would
close
my
long
narration
of
a
life
of
woes
but
such
was
heaven
high
will
know
then
i
came
from
sacred
crete

from
a

of

in

bless
in

in

more
sprung
of
a
handmaid
from
a

embrace
i
shared
his
kindness
with
his
lawful
race
but
when
that
fate
which
all
must
undergo
from
earth
removed
him
to
the
shades
below
the
large
domain
his
greedy
sons
divide
and
each
was
portion
as
the
lots
decide
little
alas
was
left
my
wretched
share
except
a
house
a
covert
from
the

but
what
by
niggard
fortune
was
denied
a
willing

copious
wealth
supplied
my
valour
was
my

that
true

death
in

appear
i

him

it

not
mine
to

before
the

i
raised
my

the

the

with

how
would
the

a

bore
with

domestic
pampered

the

bespoke

if

paused
with

the

queen
relieved
his

hear
me
she
cried
to
whom
the

have
given
to
read
this
sign
and
mystic
sense
of
heaven
as
thus
the
plumy
sovereign
of
the
air
left
on
the
mountain
brow
his
callow
care
and
wander
through
the
wide
ethereal
way
to
pour
his
wrath
on
yon
luxurious
prey
so
shall
thy
godlike
father
toss
in
vain
through
all
the
dangers
of
the
boundless
main
arrive
or
if
perchance
already
come
from
slaughter
gluttons
to
release
the
dome
oh
if
this
promised
bliss
by
thundering
jove
the

replied
stand
fix
in
fate
above
to
thee
as
to
some
god
i
temples
raise
and
crown
thy
altars
with
the
costly

he
said
and
bending
his
chariot
flung
athwart
the
fiery
steeds
the
smarting
thong
the
bounding
shafts
upon
the

play
till

all

the

stay
nor
found
the

unpaid
but
soon
as
morning
from
her
orient
bed
had
tinged
the

with
her
earliest
red
they
join
the
steeds
and
on
the

sprung

they
came

the

no

implore

lash
them
to
the
shore
too
long
thy

would
his

detain
i
dread
his
proffer
kindness
urged
in
vain
the
hero
paused
and
ponder
this
request
while
love
and
duty
warr
within
his
breast
at
length
resolved
he
turn
his
ready
hand
and
lash
his
panting
coursers
to
the

there
while
within
the
poop
with
care
he
stored

glow

sounding
strokes

and
soon
he
reached
the

cried
telemachus
with

prepare

the

eumaeus
sprung
dropp

round
his
bosom
hung
kissing
his
cheek
his
hand
while
from
his
eye
the
tears
rain
copious
in
a
shower
of
joy
as
some
fond
sire
who
ten
long
winters
grieves
from
foreign
climes
an
only
son
receives
child
of
his
age
with
strong
paternal
joy
forward
he
springs
and
clasps
the
favourite
boy
so
round
the
youth
his

eumaeus
spread
as
if
the
grave
had
given
him
from

and
is
it
thou
my
delight
oh
art
thou
come
to
bless
my
longing
sight
never
i
never
hoped
to

this
day
when
the

you
plough
the
desperate
way
enter
my

beyond

restored
oh
give
these

the

took
my

but

thus
he
and
thus
the

severely
chaste
penelope
remains
but
lost
to
every
joy
she
wastes
the
day
in
tedious

and
weeps
the

away

the

too
curious

while
the
proud

the

enjoy
suffice
it
in

let

rejoin
and
such
as
suits
the
dictate
of
my

lead
on
but
help
me
to
some
staff
to
stay
my
feeble
step
since
rugged

the

across

then
the

how

on
a

dishonest
fluttering
with

now
pass
the
rugged

journey
down
the
cavern

descending
to
the
town
where
from
the
rock
with
liquid
drops
distils
a
limpid
fount
that
spread
in

its

melanthias
came
two

with

for

he
ask

to

better

we
perhaps
might

him
off

the

thus
nor

spurn
with

unknown
spurn

not

he
like

short
was
that

to
quell
his

inured
the

stood

endured
but
hateful
of

eumaeus
heaved
his

obtesting

from

so
spoke
the

shunning

turn
his

and
left
them
on

straight
to
the
feastful

and
replied
the
chief
to
no
unheedful
breast
the
wrongs
and
injuries
of
base
mankind
fresh
to
my

and
always
in
my

the
to

on
rolling

in

fields
storms
have
i
pass
and
many
a
stern
debate
and
now
in
humbler
scene
submit
to
fate
what
can
not

the
best
she
will
expose
and
i
am
learn
in
all
her
train
of
woes
she
fills
with
navies
hosts
and
loud
alarms
the
sea
the
land
and
shakes
the
world
with
arms
thus
near
the
gates
conferring
as
they
drew
argus
the
dog
his
ancient
master
knew
he
not
unconscious
of
the
voice
and
tread
lifts
to
the
sound
his
ear
and
rears
his
head
bred
by
ulysses
nourish
at
his
board
but
ah
not
fated
long
to
please
his
lord
to
him
his
swiftness
and
his
strength
were
vain
the
voice
of
glory
call
him
the
main
till
then
in
every

chase
renown
with
argus
argus
rung
the

the
mazy
leveret

now
left
to

ingratitude
he
lay
unhoused
neglected
in
the
public
way
and
where
on
heaps
the
rich
manure
was
spread
obscene
with
reptiles
took
his
sordid
bed
he
knew
his
lord
he
knew
and
strove
to
meet
in
vain
he
strove
to
crawl
and
kiss
his
feet
yet
all
he
could

salute
his

and
confess

pity
touch
the
mighty

soul
adown
his

a
tear
unbidden
stole
stole
unperceived
he
turn
his

and
dried
the
drop
humane
then
thus
impassion
cried
what
noble
beast
in
this
abandon
state
lies
here
all
helpless
at
ulysses
gate
his
bulk
and
beauty
speak
no
vulgar
praise
if
as
he
seems
he
was
in
better
days
some
care
his
age
deserves
or
was
he
prized
for
worthless
beauty
therefore
now
despised
such
dogs
and
men
there
are
mere
things
of
state
and
always
cherish
by
their
friends
the
great
not
argus
so
eumaeus
thus
rejoin
but
served
a
master
of
a
nobler
kind
who
never
never
shall
behold
him
more
long
long
since
perish
on
a
distant
shore
oh
had
you
seen
him
vigorous
bold
and
young
swift
as
a
stag
and
as
a
lion
strong
him
no
fell
savage
on
the
plain
withstood
none
him

in
the
gloomy
wood
his
eye
how
piercing
and
his
scent
how
true
to
wind
the
vapour
on
the
tainted
dew
such
when
ulysses
left
his
natal
coast
now
years
unnerve
him
and
his
lord
is
lost
the
women
keep
the
generous
creature
bare
a
sleek
and
idle
race
is
all
their

the

gone
the

humanity
where

reigns
jove
fix
it
certain
that
whatever

takes
half
his
worth
away
this
said
the
honest
herdsman
strode
before
the
musing
monarch
pauses
at
the
door
the
dog
whom
fate
had
granted
to
behold
his
lord
when
twenty
tedious
years
had
roll
takes
a
last
look
and
having
seen
him
dies
so
closed
for
ever
faithful
argus
eyes
and
now
telemachus
the
first
of
all
observed
eumaeus
entering
in
the
hall
distant
he
saw
across
the
shady
dome
then
gave
a
sign
and
beckon
him
to
come
there
stood
an
empty
seat
where
late
was
placed
in
order
due
the
steward
of
the
feast
who
now
was
busied
carving
round
the
board
eumaeus
took
and
placed
it
near
his
lord
before
him
instant
was
the
banquet
spread
and
the
bright
basket
piled
with
loaves
of
bread
next
came
ulysses
lowly
at
the
door
a
figure
despicable
old
and
poor
in
squalid
vests
with
many
a
gaping
rent
propp
or
a
staff
and
trembling
as
he
went
then
resting
on
the
threshold
of
the
gate
against
a
cypress
pillar
lean
his
weight
smooth
by
the
workman
to
a
polish
plane
the
thoughtful
son
beheld
and
call
his
swain
these
viands
and
this
bread
eumaeus
bear
and
let
yon
mendicant
our
plenty
share
and
let
him
circle
round
the
suitors
board
and
try
the
bounty
of
each
gracious
lord
bold
let
him
ask
encouraged
thus
by
me
how
ill
alas
do
want
and
shame
agree

the
faithful

the
seeming

with
his
prayers
bless

telemachus
in
every
deed
inspire
him
jove
in
every
wish
succeed
this
said
the
portion
from
his
son
with
smiles
receiving
on
his
scrip
he
laid
long
has
the
minstrel
swept
the
sounding
wire
he
fed
and
ceased
when
silence
held
the
lyre
soon
as
the
suitors
from
the
banquet
rose
minerva
prompts
the
man
of
mighty
woes
to
tempt
their
bounties
with
a
suppliant
art
and
learn
the
generous
from
the
ignoble
heart
not
but
his
soul
resentful
as
humane
dooms
to
full
vengeance

the
offending
train
with
speaking
eyes
and

of
plaintive

he
moves
imploring
all
around

thus

with

time
steals

he

on

me
hear

indulge

devour
the

and
turn
my

down

for
where

he

the

the

with
the

but
eumaeus
thus
rejoin
he
only
asks
a
more
propitious
hour
and
shuns
who
would
not
wicked

at

with
flattering
hopes

fly
the
bridal
day
thy

wonder
and
thy
son
to
raise
and
crown
the
mother
and
the
wife
with
praise
then
while
the
streaming
sorrow
dims
her
eyes
thus
with
a
transient
smile
the
matron
cries
eurynome
to
go
where
riot
reigns
i
feel
an
impulse
though
my
soul
disdains
to
my
loved
son
the
snares
of
death
to
show
and
in
the
traitor
friend
unmask
the
foe
who
smooth
of

in
purpose
insincere
hides
fraud
in
smiles
while
death
is
ambush
there
go
warn
thy

nor
be
the
warning

replied
the
sagest

bathed

powerful

every
grace
attend
the
tide
of
flowing

awhile
suppress
tears
but
indulge
the
sorrow
not
repress
some
joy
remains
to
thee
a
son
is
given
such
as
in
fondness
parents
ask
of

ah

forbear
returns
the

forbear
oh

talk
not

vain
beauty

no

since
he
no

sees
those
charms
for

alone
i
wish
to

the
day
that
bore
ulysses
from
this
coast
blasted
the
little
bloom
these

could
boast
but
instant

autonoe
descend
instant
hippodame
our
steps
attend
ill
suits
it
female
virtue
to
be
seen
alone
indecent
in
the
walks
of
men
then
while
eurynome
the
mandate
bears
from
heaven
minerva
shoots
with
guardian
cares
all
her
senses
as
the
couch
she
press
she
pours
a
pleasing
deep
and
rest
with
every
beauty
every

bids
her

glow

lights
up
all
her
charms
in
her

awakes
the
fires
immortal
gifts
to
kindle
soft
desires
from
limb
to
limb
an
air
majestic
sheds
and
the
pure
ivory
her
bosom
spreads
such
venus
shines
when
with
a
measured
bound
she
smoothly
gliding
swims
the
harmonious
round
when
with
the
graces
in
the
dance
she
moves
and
fires
the
gazing
gods
with
ardent
loves
then
to
the
skies
her
flight
minerva
bends
and
to
the
queen
the
damsel
train
descends
waked
at
their
steps
her
flowing
eyes
unclose
the
tears
she
wipes
and
thus
renews
her
woes
is
well
that
sleep
awhile
can
free
with
soft
forgetfulness
a
wretch
like
me
oh
were
it
given
to
yield
this
transient
breath
send
o
diana
send
the
sleep
of
death
why
must
i
waste
a
tedious
life
in
tears
nor
bury
in
the
silent
grave
my
cares
o
my
ulysses
ever
honour
name
for
thee
i
mourn
till
death
dissolves
my
frame
thus
wailing
slow
and
sadly
she
descends
on
either
band
a
damsel
train
attends
full
where
the
dome
its
shining
valves
expands
radiant
before
the
gazing
peers
she
stands
a
veil
translucent
her
brow
display
her
beauty
seems
and
only
seems
to
shade
sudden
she
lightens
in
their
dazzled
eyes
and
sudden
flames
in
every
bosom
rise
they
send
their
eager
souls
with
every
look
till
silence
thus
the
imperial
matron
broke
o
why
my
son
why
now
no
more
appears
that
warmth
of
soul
that
urged
thy
younger
years
thy
riper
days
no
growing
worth
impart
a
man
in
stature
still
a
boy
in
heart
thy
frame
unprofitably
strong
speaks
thee
a
hero
from
a
hero
sprung
but
the
just
gods
in
vain
those
gifts
bestow
o
wise
alone
in
form
and
grave
in
show
heavens
could
a
stranger
feel
oppression
hand
beneath
thy
roof
and
couldst
thou
tamely
stand
if
thou
the
stranger
righteous
cause
decline
his
is
the
sufferance
but
the
shame
is
thine
to
whom
with
filial
awe
the
prince
returns
that
generous
soul
with
just
resentment
burns
yet
taught
by
time
my
heart
has
learn
to
glow
for
others
good
and
melt
at
others
woe
but
impotent
those
riots
to
repel
i
bear
their
outrage
though
my
soul
rebel
helpless
amid
the
snares
of
death
i
tread
and
numbers
leagued
in
impious
union
dread
but
now
no
crime
is
theirs
this
wrong
proceeds
from
irus
and
the
guilty
irus
bleeds
oh
would
to
jove
or
her
whose
arms
display
the
shield
of
jove
or
him
who
rules
the
day
that
yon
proud
suitors
who
licentious
tread
these
courts
within
these
courts
like
irus
bled
whose
loose
head
tottering
as
with
wine
oppress
obliquely
drops
and
nodding
knocks
his
breast
powerless
to
move
his
staggering
feet
deny
the
coward
wretch
the
privilege
to
fly
then
to
the
queen
eurymachus
replies
o
justly
loved
and
not
more
fair
than
wise
should
greece
through
all
her
hundred
states
survey
thy
finish
charms
all
greece
would
own
thy
sway
in
rival
crowds
contest
the
glorious
prize
dispeopling
realms
to
gaze
upon
thy
eyes
o
woman
loveliest
of
the
lovely
kind
in
body
perfect
and
complete
in
mind
ah
me
returns
the
queen
when
from
this
shore
ulysses
sail
then
beauty
was
no
more
the
gods
decreed
these
eyes
no
more
should
keep
their
wonted
grace
but
only
serve
to
weep
should
he
return
my
beauties
prove
my
virtues
last
my
brightest
charm
is
love
now
grief
thou
all
art
mine
the
gods
my
soul
with
woes
that
long
ah
long
must
last
too
faithfully
my
heart
retains
the
day
that
sadly
tore
my
royal
lord
away
he
grasp
my
hand
and
my
spouse
i
leave
thy
arms
he
cried
perhaps
to
find
a
grave
fame
speaks
the
trojans
bold
they
boast
the
skill
to
give
the
feather
arrow
wings
to
kill
to
dart
the
spear
and
guide
the
rushing
car
with
dreadful
inroad
through
the
walks
of
war
my
sentence
is
gone
forth
and
is
decreed
perhaps
by
righteous
heaven
that
i
must
bleed
my
father
mother
all
i
trust
to
three
to
them
to
them
transfer
the
love
of
me
but
when
my
son
grows
man
the
royal
sway
resign
and
happy
be
thy
bridal
day
such
were
his
words
and
hymen
now
prepares

me
up
to

the
afflictive
hand

thine
the

with

no

no

i
lead
the

i
too
may
try

if
this

can
wing
the
feather
arrow
through
the

ring
then
if
no

boast
i
shall
not

moveless
as

how

deride

we
in

waste
away

forego

leave
fixed
the

in

now
bid
the

approach

let
us
join
in
due
libations
and
in
rites
divine
so
end

if
it

this

sent
him

hence
with

the

was
cursed
fatal

to

such

some

telemachus
may
claim
what
if
the

on
the

bestow
sufficient
strength
to
draw
the
mighty

shall
i
a

accept

thus
eurymachus
rejoin
moved
by
no
weak
surmise
but
sense
of

we
dread
the

we
dread
the

of

all
can
wrong
the

what

they
could
not
bend
in
came
a
beggar
of
the
strolling
crew
and
did
what
all
those
princes
could
not
do
thus
will
the
common
voice
our
deed
defame
and
thus
posterity
upbraid
our

to
whom
the

if

engage
your

forbear
those
acts
which

pursues

that

to

most
to

mature
beyond

the
queen
admired
his
sage
reply
and
with
her
train
retired
there
in
her
chamber
as
she
sate
apart
revolved
his

and
placed
them
in

then
she
fix
her

down

roll
till
gentle
pallas
piteous
of
her
cries
in

closed
her

now
through

the

eumaeus
bore
and

was

wild
uproar
hold
lawless

whither
wilt
thou
go
to

thou
bear
the

then
what

of

go

with

with

the

indulging
in
the

eumaeus
thus
encouraged
hastes
to
bring
the
strifeful

and
gives
it
to
the

old
euryclea
calling
them
aside
hear
what
telemachus
enjoins
he
cried
at
every

let
some

and
if

sounds
invade
their

now
shall

heedless
he
heard
them
but
disdain
reply
the

perusing
with

then
as
some

taught
to
sing
high

the

the

suffer
in
her
shame
and
the

that
bears

thus
in
the
regions
of
eternal
shade
conferr
the
mournful
phantoms
of
the

while
from
the

ulysses
and
his

pass
to
laertes
cultivated
land
the
ground
himself
had
purchased
with
his
pain
and
labour
made
the
rugged
soil
a
plain
there
stood
his
mansion
of
the
rural
sort
with
useful
buildings
round
the
lowly
court
where
the
few
servants
that
divide
his
care
took
their
laborious
rest
and
homely
fare
and
one
sicilian

old
and

with
constant

tends
his
drooping
age

arriving
to
his
rustic

and
martial

enter

of
the
bristly

select
the

to
the
powers
divine
alone
and
unattended
let
me
try
if
yet
i
share
the
old
man
memory
if
those
dim
eyes
can
yet
ulysses
know
their
light
and
dearest
object
long
ago
now
changed
with
time
with
absence
and
with
woe
then
to
his
train
he
gives
his
spear
and
shield
the
house
they
enter
and
he
seeks
the
field
through
rows
of
shade
with
various
fruitage
crown
and
labour
scenes
of
richest
verdure
round
nor
aged
dolius
nor
his
sons
were
there
nor
servants
absent
on
another
care
to
search
the
woods
for
sets
of
flowery
thorn
their
orchard
bounds
to
strengthen
and
adorn
but
all
alone
the
hoary
king
he
found
his
habit
course
but
warmly
wrapp
around
his
head
that
bow
with
many
a
pensive
care
fenced
with
a
double
cap
of
goatskin
hair
his
buskins
old
in
former
service
torn
but
swell
repair
and
gloves
against
the
thorn
in
this
array
the
kingly
gardener
stood
and
clear
a
plant
encumber
with
its
wood
beneath
a
neighbouring
tree
the
chief
divine
gazed
his
sire
retracing
every
line
the
ruins
of
himself
now
worn
away
with
age
yet
still
majestic
in
decay
sudden
his
eyes
released
their
watery
store
the
man
could
bear
no
more
doubtful
he
stood
if
instant
to
embrace
his
aged
limbs
to
kiss
his
reverend
face
with
eager
transport
to
disclose
the
whole
and
pour
at
once
the
torrent
of
his
not
so
his
judgment
takes
the
winding
way
of
question
distant
and
of
soft
essay
more
gentle
methods
on
weak
age
employs
and
moves
the
sorrows
to
enhance
the
joys
then
to
his
sire
with
beating
heart
he
moves
and
with
a
tender
pleasantry
reproves
who
digging
round
the
plant
still
hangs
his
bead
nor
aught
remits
the
work
while
thus
he
said
great
is
thy
skill
o

in
the
grave
time

then
were
at
the
best
when
at
my
house
i
lodged
this
foreign
guest
he
said
from
ithaca
fair
isle
he
came
and
old
laertes
was

whatever

lies
a
prey
to
monsters
of
the

savage
beasts

scatter
through

nor

who
thou
art
