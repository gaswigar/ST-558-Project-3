the
history
of
pendennis
by
william
makepeace
thackeray
to
john
elliotson
my
dear
doctor
thirteen
months
ago
when
it
seemed
likely
that
this
story
had
come
to
a
close
a
kind
friend
brought
you
to
my
bedside
whence
in
all
probability
i
never
should
have
risen
but
for
your
constant
watchfulness
and
skill
i
like
to
recall
your
great
goodness
and
kindness
as
well
as
many
acts
of
others
showing
quite
a
surprising
friendship
and
sympathy
at
that
time
when
kindness
and
friendship
were
most
needed
and
welcome
and
as
you
would
take
no
other
fee
but
thanks
let
me
record
them
here
in
behalf
of
me
and
mine
and
subscribe
myself
yours
most
sincerely
and
gratefully
thackeray
preface
if
this
kind
of
composition
of
which
the
two
years
product
is
now
laid
before
the
public
fail
in
art
as
it
constantly
does
and
must
it
at
least
has
the
advantage
of
a
certain
truth
and
honesty
which
a
work
more
elaborate
might
lose
in
his
constant
communication
with
the
reader
the
writer
is
forced
into
frankness
of
expression
and
to
speak
out
his
own
mind
and
feelings
as
they
urge
him
many
a
slip
of
the
pen
and
the
printer
many
a
word
spoken
in
haste
he
sees
and
would
recall
as
he
looks
over
his
volume
it
is
a
sort
of
confidential
talk
between
writer
and
reader
which
must
often
be
dull
must
often
flag
in
the
course
of
his
volubility
the
perpetual
speaker
must
of
necessity
lay
bare
his
own
weaknesses
vanities
peculiarities
and
as
we
judge
of
a
man
character
after
long
frequenting
his
society
not
by
one
speech
or
by
one
mood
or
opinion
or
by
one
day
talk
but
by
the
tenor
of
his
general
bearing
and
conversation
so
of
a
writer
who
delivers
himself
up
to
you
perforce
unreservedly
you
say
is
he
honest
does
he
tell
the
truth
in
the
main
does
he
seem
actuated
by
a
desire
to
find
out
and
speak
it
is
he
a
quack
who
shams
sentiment
or
mouths
for
effect
does
he
seek
popularity
by
claptraps
or
other
arts
i
can
no
more
ignore
good
fortune
than
any
other
chance
which
has
befallen
me
i
have
found
many
thousands
more
readers
than
i
ever
looked
for
i
have
no
right
to
say
to
these
you
shall
not
find
fault
with
my
art
or
fall
asleep
over
my
pages
but
i
ask
you
to
believe
that
this
person
writing
strives
to
tell
the
truth
if
there
is
not
that
there
is
nothing
perhaps
the
lovers
of
may
care
to
know
that
this
book
began
with
a
very
precise
plan
which
was
entirely
put
aside
ladies
and
gentlemen
you
were
to
have
been
treated
and
the
writer
and
the
publisher
pocket
benefited
by
the
recital
of
the
most
active
horrors
what
more
exciting
than
a
ruffian
with
many
admirable
virtues
in
giles
visited
constantly
by
a
young
lady
from
belgravia
what
more
stirring
than
the
contrasts
of
society
the
mixture
of
slang
and
fashionable
language
the
escapes
the
battles
the
murders
nay
up
to
nine
this
very
morning
my
poor
friend
colonel
altamont
was
doomed
to
execution
and
the
author
only
relented
when
his
victim
was
actually
at
the
window
the
plan
was
laid
aside
with
a
very
honourable
forbearance
on
the
part
of
the
publishers
because
on
attempting
it
i
found
that
i
failed
from
want
of
experience
of
my
subject
and
never
having
been
intimate
with
any
convict
in
my
life
and
the
manners
of
ruffians
and
being
quite
unfamiliar
to
me
the
idea
of
entering
into
competition
with
eugene
sue
was
abandoned
to
describe
a
real
rascal
you
must
make
him
so
horrible
that
he
would
be
too
hideous
to
show
and
unless
the
painter
paints
him
fairly
i
hold
he
has
no
right
to
show
him
at
all
even
the
gentlemen
of
our
age
this
is
an
attempt
to
describe
one
of
them
no
better
nor
worse
than
most
educated
men
even
these
we
can
not
show
as
they
are
with
the
notorious
foibles
and
selfishness
of
their
lives
and
their
education
since
the
author
of
tom
jones
was
buried
no
writer
of
fiction
among
us
has
been
permitted
to
depict
to
his
utmost
power
a
man
we
must
drape
him
and
give
him
a
certain
conventional
simper
society
will
not
tolerate
the
natural
in
our
art
many
ladies
have
remonstrated
and
subscribers
left
me
because
in
the
course
of
the
story
i
described
a
young
man
resisting
and
affected
by
temptation
my
object
was
to
say
that
he
had
the
passions
to
feel
and
the
manliness
and
generosity
to
overcome
them
you
will
not
hear
it
is
best
to
know
it
what
moves
in
the
real
world
what
passes
in
society
in
the
clubs
colleges
what
is
the
life
and
talk
of
your
sons
a
little
more
frankness
than
is
customary
has
been
attempted
in
this
story
with
no
bad
desire
on
the
writer
part
it
is
hoped
and
with
no
ill
consequence
to
any
reader
if
truth
is
not
always
pleasant
at
any
rate
truth
is
best
from
whatever
chair
from
those
whence
graver
writers
or
thinkers
argue
as
from
that
at
which
the
sits
as
he
concludes
his

morning
in

london
season
major
arthur
pendennis
came
over
from
his
lodgings
according
to
his
custom
to
breakfast
at
a
certain
club
in
pall
mall
of
which
he
was
a
chief
ornament
as
he
was
one
of
the
finest
judges
of
wine
in
england
and
a
man
of
active
dominating
and
inquiring
spirit
he
had
been
very
properly
chosen
to
be
a
member
of
the
committee
of
this
club
and
indeed
was
almost
the
manager
of
the
institution
and
the
stewards
and
waiters
bowed
before
him
as
reverentially
as
to
a
duke
or
a
at
a
quarter
past
ten
the
major
invariably
made
his
appearance
in
the
best
blacked
boots
in
all
london
with
a
checked
morning
cravat
that
never
was
rumpled
until
dinner
time
a
buff
waistcoat
which
bore
the
crown
of
his
sovereign
on
the
buttons
and
linen
so
spotless
that
brummel
himself
asked
the
name
of
his
laundress
and
would
probably
have
employed
her
had
not
misfortunes
compelled
that
great
man
to
fly
the
country
pendennis
coat
his
white
gloves
his
whiskers
his
very
cane
were
perfect
of
their
kind
as
specimens
of
the
costume
of
a
military
man
en
retraite
at
a
distance
or
seeing
his
back
merely
you
would
have
taken
him
to
be
not
more
than
thirty
years
old
it
was
only
by
a
nearer
inspection
that
you
saw
the
factitious
nature
of
his
rich
brown
hair
and
that
there
were
a
few
round
about
the
somewhat
faded
eyes
of
his
handsome
mottled
face
his
nose
was
of
the
wellington
pattern
his
hands
and
wristbands
were
beautifully
long
and
white
on
the
latter
he
wore
handsome
gold
buttons
given
to
him
by
his
royal
highness
the
duke
of
york
and
on
the
others
more
than
one
elegant
ring
the
chief
and
largest
of
them
being
emblazoned
with
the
famous
arms
of
pendennis
he
always
took
possession
of
the
same
table
in
the
same
corner
of
the
room
from
which
nobody
ever
now
thought
of
ousting
him
one
or
two
mad
wags
and
wild
fellows
had
in
former
days
and
in
freak
or
bravado
endeavoured
twice
or
thrice
to
deprive
him
of
this
place
but
there
was
a
quiet
dignity
in
the
major
manner
as
he
took
his
seat
at
the
next
table
and
surveyed
the
interlopers
which
rendered
it
impossible
for
any
man
to
sit
and
breakfast
under
his
eye
and
that
table
by
the
fire
and
yet
near
the
window
became
his
own
his
letters
were
laid
out
there
in
expectation
of
his
arrival
and
many
was
the
young
fellow
about
town
who
looked
with
wonder
at
the
number
of
those
notes
and
at
the
seals
and
franks
which
they
bore
if
there
was
any
question
about
etiquette
society
who
was
married
to
whom
of
what
age
such
and
such
a
duke
was
pendennis
was
the
man
to
whom
every
one
appealed
marchionesses
used
to
drive
up
to
the
club
and
leave
notes
for
him
or
fetch
him
out
he
was
perfectly
affable
the
young
men
liked
to
walk
with
him
in
the
park
or
down
pall
mall
for
he
touched
his
hat
to
everybody
and
every
other
man
he
met
was
a
lord
the
major
sate
down
at
his
accustomed
table
then
and
while
the
waiters
went
to
bring
him
his
toast
and
his
hot
newspaper
he
surveyed
his
letters
through
his
gold
double
he
carried
it
so
gaily
you
would
hardly
have
known
it
was
spectacles
in
disguise
and
examined
one
pretty
note
after
another
and
laid
them
by
in
order
there
were
large
solemn
dinner
cards
suggestive
of
three
courses
and
heavy
conversation
there
were
neat
little
confidential
notes
conveying
female
entreaties
there
was
a
note
on
thick
official
paper
from
the
marquis
of
steyne
telling
him
to
come
to
richmond
to
a
little
party
at
the
star
and
garter
and
speak
french
which
language
the
major
possessed
very
perfectly
and
another
from
the
bishop
of
ealing
and
mrs
trail
requesting
the
honour
of
major
pendennis
company
at
ealing
house
all
of
which
letters
pendennis
read
gracefully
and
with
the
more
satisfaction
because
glowry
the
scotch
surgeon
breakfasting
opposite
to
him
was
looking
on
and
hating
him
for
having
so
many
invitations
which
nobody
ever
sent
to
glowry
these
perused
the
major
took
out
his
to
see
on
what
days
he
was
disengaged
and
which
of
these
many
hospitable
calls
he
could
afford
to
accept
or
decline
he
threw
over
cutler
the
east
india
director
in
baker
street
in
order
to
dine
with
lord
steyne
and
the
little
french
party
at
the
star
and
garter
the
bishop
he
accepted
because
though
the
dinner
was
slow
he
liked
to
dine
with
bishops
and
so
went
through
his
list
and
disposed
of
them
according
to
his
fancy
or
interest
then
he
took
his
breakfast
and
looked
over
the
paper
the
gazette
the
births
and
deaths
and
the
fashionable
intelligence
to
see
that
his
name
was
down
among
the
guests
at
my
lord
fete
and
in
the
intervals
of
these
occupations
carried
on
cheerful
conversation
with
his
acquaintances
about
the
room
among
the
letters
which
formed
major
pendennis
budget
for
that
morning
there
was
only
one
unread
and
which
lay
solitary
and
apart
from
all
the
fashionable
london
letters
with
a
country
postmark
and
a
homely
seal
the
superscription
was
in
a
pretty
delicate
female
hand
and
though
marked
by
the
fair
writer
with
a
strong
dash
of
anxiety
under
the
word
yet
the
major
had
for
reasons
of
his
own
neglected
up
to
the
present
moment
his
humble
rural
petitioner
who
to
be
sure
could
hardly
hope
to
get
a
hearing
among
so
many
grand
folks
who
attended
his
levee
the
fact
was
this
was
a
letter
from
a
female
relative
of
pendennis
and
while
the
grandees
of
her
brother
acquaintance
were
received
and
got
their
interview
and
drove
off
as
it
were
the
patient
country
letter
remained
for
a
long
time
waiting
for
an
audience
in
the
under
the
at
last
it
came
to
be
this
letter
turn
and
the
major
broke
a
seal
with
engraved
upon
it
and
mary
for
a
postmark
it
was
a
double
letter
and
the
major
commenced
perusing
the
envelope
before
he
attacked
the
inner
epistle
is
it
a
letter
from
another
jook
growled
glowry
inwardly
pendennis
would
not
be
leaving
that
to
the
last
i
my
dear
major
pendennis
the
letter
ran
i
beg
and
implore
you
to
come
to
me
immediately
very
likely
thought
pendennis
and
dinner
i
am
in
the
very
greatest
grief
and
perplexity
my
dearest
boy
who
has
been
hitherto
everything
the
fondest
mother
could
wish
is
grieving
me
dreadfully
he
has
formed
i
can
hardly
write
it
a
passion
an
infatuation
the
major
grinned
for
an
actress
who
has
been
performing
here
she
is
at
least
twelve
years
older
than
arthur
who
will
not
be
eighteen
till
next
february
and
the
wretched
boy
insists
upon
marrying
hay
what
making
pendennis
swear
now
glowry
asked
of
himself
for
rage
and
wonder
were
concentrated
in
the
major
open
mouth
as
he
read
this
astounding
announcement
do
my
dear
friend
the
lady
went
on
come
to
me
instantly
on
the
receipt
of
this
and
as
arthur
guardian
entreat
command
the
wretched
child
to
give
up
this
most
deplorable
and
after
more
entreaties
to
the
above
effect
the
writer
concluded
by
signing
herself
the
major
affectionate
sister
helen
pendennis
fairoaks
tuesday
the
major
concluded
reading
the
last
words
of
the
letter
a
d
pretty
business
at
fairoaks
tuesday
now
let
us
see
what
the
boy
has
to
say
and
he
took
the
other
letter
which
was
written
in
a
great
floundering
boy
hand
and
sealed
with
the
large
signet
of
the
pendennises
even
larger
than
the
major
own
and
with
supplementary
wax
sputtered
all
round
the
seal
in
token
of
the
tremulousness
and
agitation
the
epistle
ran
thus
fairoaks
monday
midnight
my
dear
uncle
in
informing
you
of
my
engagement
with
miss
costigan
daughter
of
chesterfield
costigan
of
costiganstown
but
perhaps
better
known
to
you
under
her
professional
name
of
miss
fotheringay
of
the
theatres
royal
drury
lane
and
crow
street
and
of
the
norwich
and
welsh
circuit
i
am
aware
that
i
make
an
announcement
which
can
not
according
to
the
present
prejudices
of
society
at
least
be
welcome
to
my
family
my
dearest
mother
on
whom
god
knows
i
would
wish
to
inflict
no
needless
pain
is
deeply
moved
and
grieved
i
am
sorry
to
say
by
the
intelligence
which
i
have
this
night
conveyed
to
her
i
beseech
you
my
dear
sir
to
come
down
and
reason
with
her
and
console
her
although
obliged
by
poverty
to
earn
an
honourable
maintenance
by
the
exercise
of
her
splendid
talents
miss
family
is
as
ancient
and
noble
as
our
own
when
our
ancestor
ralph
pendennis
landed
with
richard
ii
in
ireland
my
emily
forefathers
were
kings
of
that
country
i
have
the
information
from
costigan
who
like
yourself
is
a
military
man
it
is
in
vain
i
have
attempted
to
argue
with
my
dear
mother
and
prove
to
her
that
a
young
lady
of
irreproachable
character
and
lineage
endowed
with
the
most
splendid
gifts
of
beauty
and
genius
who
devotes
herself
to
the
exercise
of
one
of
the
noblest
professions
for
the
sacred
purpose
of
maintaining
her
family
is
a
being
whom
we
should
all
love
and
reverence
rather
than
avoid
my
poor
mother
has
prejudices
which
it
is
impossible
for
my
logic
to
overcome
and
refuses
to
welcome
to
her
arms
one
who
is
disposed
to
be
her
most
affectionate
daughter
through
life
although
miss
costigan
is
some
years
older
than
myself
that
circumstance
does
not
operate
as
a
barrier
to
my
affection
and
i
am
sure
will
not
influence
its
duration
a
love
like
mine
sir
i
feel
is
contracted
once
and
for
ever
as
i
never
had
dreamed
of
love
until
i
saw
her
i
feel
now
that
i
shall
die
without
ever
knowing
another
passion
it
is
the
fate
of
my
life
it
was
miss
own
delicacy
which
suggested
that
the
difference
of
age
which
i
never
felt
might
operate
as
a
bar
to
our
union
but
having
loved
once
i
should
despise
myself
and
be
unworthy
of
my
name
as
a
gentleman
if
i
hesitated
to
abide
by
my
passion
if
i
did
not
give
all
where
i
felt
all
and
endow
the
woman
who
loves
me
fondly
with
my
whole
heart
and
my
whole
fortune
i
press
for
a
speedy
marriage
with
my
emily
for
why
in
truth
should
it
be
delayed
a
delay
implies
a
doubt
which
i
cast
from
me
as
unworthy
it
is
impossible
that
my
sentiments
can
change
towards
emily
that
at
any
age
she
can
be
anything
but
the
sole
object
of
my
love
why
then
wait
i
entreat
you
my
dear
uncle
to
come
down
and
reconcile
my
dear
mother
to
our
union
and
i
address
you
as
a
man
of
the
world
qui
mores
hominum
multorum
vidit
et
urbes
who
will
not
feel
any
of
the
weak
scruples
and
fears
which
agitate
a
lady
who
has
scarcely
ever
left
her
village
pray
come
down
to
us
immediately
i
am
quite
confident
that
apart
from
considerations
of
fortune
you
will
admire
and
approve
of
my
your
affectionate
nephew
arthur
pendennis
when
the
major
had
concluded
the
perusal
of
this
letter
his
countenance
assumed
an
expression
of
such
rage
and
horror
that
glowry
the
felt
in
his
pocket
for
his
lancet
which
he
always
carried
in
his
and
thought
his
respected
friend
was
going
into
a
fit
the
intelligence
was
indeed
sufficient
to
agitate
pendennis
the
head
of
the
pendennises
going
to
marry
an
actress
ten
years
his
senior
a
headstrong
boy
going
to
plunge
into
matrimony
the
mother
has
spoiled
the
young
rascal
groaned
the
major
inwardly
with
her
cursed
sentimentality
and
romantic
rubbish
my
nephew
marry
a
tragedy
queen
gracious
mercy
people
will
laugh
at
me
so
that
i
shall
not
dare
show
my
head
and
he
thought
with
an
inexpressible
pang
that
he
must
give
up
lord
steyne
dinner
at
richmond
and
must
lose
his
rest
and
pass
the
night
in
an
abominable
tight
instead
of
taking
pleasure
as
he
had
promised
himself
in
some
of
the
most
agreeable
and
select
society
in
england
and
he
must
not
only
give
up
this
but
all
other
engagements
for
some
time
to
come
who
knows
how
long
the
business
might
detain
him
he
quitted
his
breakfast
table
for
the
adjoining
and
there
ruefully
wrote
off
refusals
to
the
marquis
the
earl
the
bishop
and
all
his
entertainers
and
he
ordered
his
servant
to
take
places
in
the
for
that
evening
of
course
charging
the
sum
which
he
disbursed
for
the
seats
to
the
account
of
the
widow
and
the
young
scapegrace
of
whom
he
was
guardian
chapter
ii
a
pedigree
and
other
family
matters
early
in
the
regency
of
george
the
magnificent
there
lived
in
a
small
town
in
the
west
of
england
called
clavering
a
gentleman
whose
name
was
pendennis
there
were
those
alive
who
remembered
having
seen
his
name
painted
on
a
board
which
was
surmounted
by
a
gilt
pestle
and
mortar
over
the
door
of
a
very
humble
little
shop
in
the
city
of
bath
where
pendennis
exercised
the
profession
of
apothecary
and
surgeon
and
where
he
not
only
attended
gentlemen
in
their
and
ladies
at
the
most
interesting
periods
of
their
lives
but
would
condescend
to
sell
a
plaster
to
a
farmer
wife
across
the
counter
or
to
vend
and
london
perfumery
for
these
facts
a
few
folks
at
clavering
could
vouch
where
people
memories
were
more
tenacious
perhaps
than
they
are
in
a
great
bustling
metropolis
and
yet
that
little
apothecary
who
sold
a
stray
customer
a
pennyworth
of
salts
or
a
more
fragrant
cake
of
windsor
soap
was
a
gentleman
of
good
education
and
of
as
old
a
family
as
any
in
the
whole
county
of
somerset
he
had
a
cornish
pedigree
which
carried
the
pendennises
up
to
the
time
of
the
druids
and
who
knows
how
much
farther
back
they
had
intermarried
with
the
normans
at
a
very
late
period
of
their
family
existence
and
they
were
related
to
all
the
great
families
of
wales
and
brittany
pendennis
had
had
a
piece
of
university
education
too
and
might
have
pursued
that
career
with
great
honour
but
that
in
his
second
year
at
cambridge
his
father
died
insolvent
and
poor
pen
was
obliged
to
betake
himself
to
the
pestle
and
apron
he
always
detested
the
trade
and
it
was
only
necessity
and
the
offer
of
his
mother
brother
a
london
apothecary
of
low
family
into
which
pendennis
father
had
demeaned
himself
by
marrying
that
forced
john
pendennis
into
so
odious
a
calling
he
quickly
after
his
apprenticeship
parted
from
the
practitioner
his
relative
and
set
up
for
himself
at
bath
with
his
modest
medical
ensign
he
had
for
some
time
a
hard
struggle
with
poverty
and
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
keep
the
shop
and
its
gilt
ornaments
in
decent
repair
and
his
mother
in
comfort
but
lady
ribstone
happening
to
be
passing
to
the
rooms
with
an
intoxicated
irish
chairman
who
bumped
her
ladyship
up
against
pen
very
and
drove
his
through
the
handsomest
pink
bottle
in
the
surgeon
window
alighted
screaming
from
her
vehicle
and
was
accommodated
with
a
chair
in
pendennis
shop
where
she
was
brought
round
with
cinnamon
and
pendennis
manners
were
so
uncommonly
gentlemanlike
and
soothing
that
her
ladyship
the
wife
of
sir
pepin
ribstone
of
codlingbury
in
the
county
of
somerset
appointed
her
preserver
as
she
called
him
apothecary
to
her
person
and
family
which
was
very
large
master
ribstone
coming
home
for
the
christmas
holidays
from
eton
himself
and
had
a
fever
in
which
pendennis
treated
him
with
the
greatest
skill
and
tenderness
in
a
word
he
got
the
good
graces
of
the
codlingbury
family
and
from
that
day
began
to
prosper
the
good
company
of
bath
patronised
him
and
amongst
the
ladies
especially
he
was
beloved
and
admired
first
his
humble
little
shop
became
a
smart
one
then
he
discarded
the
selling
of
and
perfumery
as
unworthy
of
a
gentleman
of
an
ancient
lineage
then
he
shut
up
the
shop
altogether
and
only
had
a
little
surgery
attended
by
a
genteel
young
man
then
he
had
a
gig
with
a
man
to
drive
him
and
before
her
exit
from
this
world
his
poor
old
mother
had
the
happiness
of
seeing
from
her
bedroom
window
to
which
her
chair
was
rolled
her
beloved
john
step
into
a
close
carriage
of
his
own
a
carriage
it
is
true
but
with
the
arms
of
the
family
of
pendennis
handsomely
emblazoned
on
the
panels
what
would
arthur
say
now
she
asked
speaking
of
a
younger
son
of
hers
who
never
so
much
as
once
came
to
see
my
dearest
johnny
through
all
the
time
of
his
poverty
and
struggles
captain
pendennis
is
with
his
regiment
in
india
mother
pendennis
remarked
and
if
you
please
i
wish
you
would
not
call
me
johnny
before
the
young
man
before
presently
the
day
came
when
she
ceased
to
call
her
son
by
the
name
of
johnny
or
by
any
other
title
of
endearment
or
affection
and
his
house
was
very
lonely
without
that
kind
though
querulous
voice
he
had
his
altered
and
placed
in
the
room
in
which
the
good
old
lady
had
grumbled
for
many
a
long
year
and
he
slept
in
the
great
large
bed
there
he
was
upwards
of
forty
years
old
when
these
events
befell
before
the
war
was
over
before
george
the
magnificent
came
to
the
throne
before
this
history
indeed
but
what
is
a
gentleman
without
his
pedigree
pendennis
by
this
time
had
his
handsomely
framed
and
glazed
and
hanging
up
in
his
between
the
pictures
of
codlingbury
house
in
somersetshire
and
boniface
college
cambridge
where
he
had
passed
the
brief
and
happy
days
of
his
early
manhood
as
for
the
pedigree
he
had
taken
it
out
of
a
trunk
as
sterne
officer
called
for
his
sword
now
that
he
was
a
gentleman
and
could
show
it
about
the
time
of
pendennis
demise
another
of
her
son
patients
likewise
died
at
bath
that
virtuous
woman
old
lady
pontypool
daughter
of
reginald
twelfth
earl
of
bareacres
and
by
consequence
to
the
present
earl
and
widow
of
john
second
lord
pontypool
and
likewise
of
the
reverend
jonas
wales
of
the
armageddon
chapel
clifton
for
the
last
five
years
of
her
life
her
ladyship
had
been
attended
by
miss
helen
thistlewood
a
very
distant
relative
of
the
noble
house
of
bareacres
before
mentioned
and
daughter
of
lieutenant
thistlewood
killed
at
the
battle
of
copenhagen
under
lady
pontypool
roof
miss
thistlewood
found
a
comfortable
shelter
as
far
as
boarding
and
lodging
went
but
suffered
under
such
an
infernal
tyranny
as
only
women
can
inflict
on
or
bear
from
one
another
the
doctor
who
paid
his
visits
to
my
lady
pontypool
at
least
twice
a
day
could
not
but
remark
the
angelical
sweetness
and
kindness
with
which
the
young
lady
bore
her
elderly
relative
insults
and
it
was
as
they
were
going
in
the
fourth
mourning
coach
to
attend
her
ladyship
venerated
remains
to
bath
abbey
where
they
now
repose
that
he
looked
at
her
sweet
pale
face
and
resolved
upon
putting
a
certain
question
to
her
the
very
nature
of
which
made
his
pulse
beat
ninety
at
least
he
was
older
than
she
by
more
than
twenty
years
and
at
no
time
the
most
ardent
of
men
perhaps
he
had
had
a
love
affair
in
early
life
which
he
had
to
strangle
perhaps
all
early
love
affairs
ought
to
be
strangled
or
drowned
like
so
many
blind
kittens
well
at
he
was
a
collected
quiet
little
gentleman
in
black
stockings
with
a
bald
head
and
a
few
days
after
the
ceremony
he
called
to
see
her
and
as
he
felt
her
pulse
he
kept
hold
of
her
hand
in
his
and
asked
her
where
she
was
going
to
live
now
that
the
pontypool
family
had
come
down
upon
the
property
which
was
being
nailed
into
boxes
and
packed
into
hampers
and
swaddled
up
with
haybands
and
buried
in
straw
and
locked
under
three
keys
in
green
baize
and
carted
away
under
the
eyes
of
poor
miss
helen
he
asked
her
where
she
was
going
to
live
finally
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
she
said
she
did
not
know
she
had
a
little
money
the
old
lady
had
left
her
a
thousand
pounds
indeed
and
she
would
go
into
a
or
into
a
school
in
fine
she
did
not
know
where
then
pendennis
looking
into
her
pale
face
and
keeping
hold
of
her
cold
little
hand
asked
her
if
she
would
come
and
live
with
him
he
was
old
compared
to
to
so
blooming
a
young
lady
as
miss
thistlewood
pendennis
was
of
the
grave
old
complimentary
school
of
gentlemen
and
apothecaries
but
he
was
of
good
birth
and
he
flattered
himself
of
good
principles
and
temper
his
prospects
were
good
and
daily
mending
he
was
alone
in
the
world
and
had
need
of
a
kind
and
constant
companion
whom
it
would
be
the
study
of
his
life
to
make
happy
in
a
word
he
recited
to
her
a
little
speech
which
he
had
composed
that
morning
in
bed
and
rehearsed
and
perfected
in
his
carriage
as
he
was
coming
to
wait
upon
the
young
lady
perhaps
if
he
had
had
an
early
she
too
had
one
day
hoped
for
a
different
lot
than
to
be
wedded
to
a
little
gentleman
who
rapped
his
teeth
and
smiled
artificially
who
was
laboriously
polite
to
the
butler
as
he
slid
upstairs
into
the
and
profusely
civil
to
the
who
waited
at
the
door
for
whom
her
old
patroness
used
to
ring
as
for
a
servant
and
who
came
with
even
more
eagerness
who
got
up
stories
as
he
sent
in
draughts
for
his
amusement
and
his
own
profit
perhaps
she
would
have
chosen
a
different
man
but
she
knew
on
the
other
hand
how
worthy
pendennis
was
how
prudent
how
honourable
how
good
he
had
been
to
his
mother
and
constant
in
his
care
of
her
and
the
upshot
of
this
interview
was
that
she
blushing
very
much
made
pendennis
an
extremely
low
curtsey
and
asked
leave
to
to
consider
his
very
kind
proposal
they
were
married
in
the
dull
bath
season
which
was
the
height
of
the
season
in
london
and
pendennis
having
previously
through
a
professional
friend
secured
lodgings
in
holles
street
cavendish
square
took
his
wife
thither
in
a
chaise
and
pair
conducted
her
to
the
theatres
the
parks
and
the
chapel
royal
showed
her
the
folks
going
to
a
and
in
a
word
gave
her
all
the
pleasures
of
the
town
he
likewise
left
cards
upon
lord
pontypool
upon
the
right
honourable
the
earl
of
bareacres
and
upon
sir
pepin
and
lady
ribstone
his
earliest
and
kindest
patrons
bareacres
took
no
notice
of
the
cards
pontypool
called
admired
pendennis
and
said
lady
pontypool
would
come
and
see
her
which
her
ladyship
did
per
proxy
of
john
her
footman
who
brought
her
card
and
an
invitation
to
a
concert
five
weeks
off
pendennis
was
back
in
his
little
carriage
dispensing
draughts
and
pills
at
that
time
but
the
ribstones
asked
him
and
pendennis
to
an
entertainment
of
which
pendennis
bragged
to
the
last
day
of
his
life
the
secret
ambition
of
pendennis
had
always
been
to
be
a
gentleman
it
takes
much
time
and
careful
saving
for
a
provincial
doctor
whose
gains
are
not
very
large
to
lay
by
enough
money
wherewith
to
purchase
a
house
and
land
but
besides
our
friend
own
frugality
and
prudence
fortune
aided
him
considerably
in
his
endeavour
and
brought
him
to
the
point
which
he
so
panted
to
attain
he
laid
out
some
money
very
advantageously
in
the
purchase
of
a
house
and
small
estate
close
upon
the
village
of
clavering
before
mentioned
words
can
not
describe
nor
did
he
himself
ever
care
to
confess
to
any
one
his
pride
when
he
found
himself
a
real
landed
proprietor
and
could
walk
over
acres
of
which
he
was
the
master
a
lucky
purchase
which
he
had
made
of
shares
in
a
added
very
considerably
to
his
wealth
and
he
realised
with
great
prudence
while
this
mine
was
still
at
its
full
vogue
finally
he
sold
his
business
at
bath
to
parkins
for
a
handsome
sum
of
ready
money
and
for
an
annuity
to
be
paid
to
him
during
a
certain
number
of
years
after
he
had
for
ever
retired
from
the
handling
of
the
mortar
and
pestle
arthur
pendennis
his
son
was
eight
years
old
at
the
time
of
this
event
so
that
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
latter
who
left
bath
and
the
surgery
so
young
should
forget
the
existence
of
such
a
place
almost
entirely
and
that
his
father
hands
had
ever
been
dirtied
by
the
compounding
of
odious
pills
or
the
preparation
of
filthy
plasters
the
old
man
never
spoke
about
the
shop
himself
never
alluded
to
it
called
in
the
medical
practitioner
of
clavering
to
attend
his
family
when
occasion
arrived
sunk
the
black
breeches
and
stockings
altogether
attended
market
and
sessions
and
wore
a
coat
and
brass
buttons
with
drab
gaiters
just
as
if
he
had
been
an
english
gentleman
all
his
life
he
used
to
stand
at
his
and
see
the
coaches
come
in
and
bow
gravely
to
the
guards
and
coachmen
as
they
touched
their
hats
and
drove
by
it
was
he
who
founded
the
clavering
book
club
and
set
up
the
samaritan
soup
and
blanket
society
it
was
he
who
brought
the
mail
which
used
to
run
through
cacklefield
before
away
from
that
village
and
through
clavering
at
church
he
was
equally
active
as
a
vestryman
and
a
worshipper
at
market
every
thursday
he
went
from
pen
to
stall
looked
at
samples
of
oats
and
munched
corn
felt
beasts
punched
geese
in
the
breast
and
weighed
them
with
a
knowing
air
and
did
business
with
the
farmers
at
the
clavering
arms
as
well
as
the
oldest
frequenter
of
that
house
of
call
it
was
now
his
shame
as
it
formerly
was
his
pride
to
be
called
doctor
and
those
who
wished
to
please
him
always
gave
him
the
title
of
squire
heaven
knows
where
they
came
from
but
a
whole
range
of
pendennis
portraits
presently
hung
round
the
doctor
oak
lelys
and
vandykes
he
vowed
all
the
portraits
to
be
and
when
questioned
as
to
the
history
of
the
originals
would
vaguely
say
they
were
of
his
you
could
see
by
his
wife
looks
that
she
disbelieved
in
these
genealogical
legends
for
she
generally
endeavoured
to
turn
the
conversation
when
he
commenced
them
but
his
little
boy
believed
them
to
their
fullest
extent
and
roger
pendennis
of
agincourt
arthur
pendennis
of
crecy
general
pendennis
of
blenheim
and
oudenarde
were
as
real
and
actual
beings
for
this
young
gentleman
as
whom
shall
we
say
as
robinson
crusoe
or
peter
wilkins
or
the
seven
champions
of
christendom
whose
histories
were
in
his
library
pendennis
fortune
which
at
the
best
was
not
above
eight
hundred
pounds
a
year
did
not
with
the
best
economy
and
management
permit
of
his
living
with
the
great
folks
of
the
county
but
he
had
a
decent
comfortable
society
of
the
sort
if
they
were
not
the
roses
they
lived
near
the
roses
as
it
were
and
had
a
good
deal
of
the
odour
of
genteel
life
they
had
out
their
plate
and
dined
each
other
round
in
the
moonlight
nights
twice
a
year
coming
a
dozen
miles
to
these
festivals
and
besides
the
county
the
pendennises
had
the
society
of
the
town
of
clavering
as
much
as
nay
more
than
they
liked
for
pybus
was
always
poking
about
helen
conservatories
and
intercepting
the
operation
of
her
and
captain
glanders
dragoon
guards
was
for
ever
swaggering
about
the
stables
and
gardens
and
endeavouring
to
enlist
him
in
his
quarrels
with
the
vicar
with
the
postmaster
with
the
reverend
wapshot
of
clavering
grammar
school
for
overflogging
his
son
anglesea
glanders
with
all
the
village
in
fine
and
pendennis
and
his
wife
often
blessed
themselves
that
their
house
of
fairoaks
was
nearly
a
mile
out
of
clavering
or
their
premises
would
never
have
been
free
from
the
prying
eyes
and
prattle
of
one
or
other
of
the
male
and
female
inhabitants
there
fairoaks
lawn
comes
down
to
the
little
river
brawl
and
on
the
other
side
were
the
plantations
and
woods
as
much
as
were
left
of
them
of
clavering
park
sir
francis
clavering
bart
the
park
was
let
out
in
pasture
and
fed
down
by
sheep
and
cattle
when
the
pendennises
came
first
to
live
at
fairoaks
shutters
were
up
in
the
house
a
splendid
freestone
palace
with
great
stairs
statues
and
porticos
whereof
you
may
see
a
picture
in
the
of
england
and
wales
sir
richard
clavering
sir
francis
grandfather
had
commenced
the
ruin
of
the
family
by
the
building
of
this
palace
his
successor
had
achieved
the
ruin
by
living
in
it
the
present
sir
francis
was
abroad
somewhere
nor
could
anybody
be
found
rich
enough
to
rent
that
enormous
mansion
through
the
deserted
rooms
mouldy
clanking
halls
and
dismal
galleries
of
which
arthur
pendennis
many
a
time
walked
trembling
when
he
was
a
boy
at
sunset
from
the
lawn
of
fairoaks
there
was
a
pretty
sight
it
and
the
opposite
park
of
clavering
were
in
the
habit
of
putting
on
a
rich
golden
tinge
which
became
them
both
wonderfully
the
upper
windows
of
the
great
house
flamed
so
as
to
make
your
eyes
wink
the
little
river
ran
off
noisily
westward
and
was
lost
in
a
sombre
wood
behind
which
the
towers
of
the
old
abbey
church
of
clavering
whereby
that
town
is
called
clavering
mary
to
the
present
day
rose
up
in
purple
splendour
little
arthur
figure
and
his
mother
cast
long
blue
shadows
over
the
grass
and
he
would
repeat
in
a
low
voice
for
a
scene
of
great
natural
beauty
always
moved
the
boy
who
inherited
this
sensibility
from
his
mother
certain
lines
beginning
these
are
thy
glorious
works
parent
of
good
almighty
thine
this
universal
frame
greatly
to
pendennis
delight
such
walks
and
conversation
generally
ended
in
a
profusion
of
filial
and
maternal
embraces
for
to
love
and
to
pray
were
the
main
occupations
of
this
dear
woman
life
and
i
have
often
heard
pendennis
say
in
his
wild
way
that
he
felt
that
he
was
sure
of
going
to
heaven
for
his
mother
never
could
be
happy
there
without
him
as
for
john
pendennis
as
the
father
of
the
family
and
that
sort
of
thing
everybody
had
the
greatest
respect
for
him
and
his
orders
were
obeyed
like
those
of
the
medes
and
persians
his
hat
was
as
well
brushed
perhaps
as
that
of
any
man
in
this
empire
his
meals
were
served
at
the
same
minute
every
day
and
woe
to
those
who
came
late
as
little
pen
a
disorderly
little
rascal
sometimes
did
prayers
were
recited
his
letters
were
read
his
business
dispatched
his
stables
and
garden
inspected
his
and
kennel
his
barn
and
pigstye
visited
always
at
regular
hours
after
dinner
he
always
had
a
nap
with
the
globe
newspaper
on
his
knee
and
his
yellow
bandanna
handkerchief
on
his
face
major
pendennis
sent
the
yellow
handkerchiefs
from
india
and
his
brother
had
helped
in
the
purchase
of
his
majority
so
that
they
were
good
friends
now
and
so
as
his
dinner
took
place
at
six
to
a
minute
and
the
sunset
business
alluded
to
may
be
supposed
to
have
occurred
at
about
seven
it
is
probable
that
he
did
not
much
care
for
the
view
in
front
of
his
lawn
windows
or
take
any
share
in
the
poetry
and
caresses
which
were
taking
place
there
they
seldom
occurred
in
his
presence
however
frisky
they
were
before
mother
and
child
were
hushed
and
quiet
when
pendennis
walked
into
the
his
newspaper
under
his
arm
and
here
while
little
pen
buried
in
a
great
chair
read
all
the
books
of
which
he
could
lay
hold
the
squire
perused
his
own
articles
in
the
gazette
or
took
a
solemn
hand
at
picquet
with
pendennis
or
an
occasional
friend
from
the
village
pendennis
usually
took
care
that
at
least
one
of
his
grand
dinners
should
take
place
when
his
brother
the
major
who
on
the
return
of
his
regiment
from
india
and
new
south
wales
had
sold
out
and
gone
upon
came
to
pay
his
biennial
visit
to
fairoaks
my
brother
major
pendennis
was
a
constant
theme
of
the
retired
doctor
conversation
all
the
family
delighted
in
my
brother
the
major
he
was
the
link
which
bound
them
to
the
great
world
of
london
and
the
fashion
he
always
brought
down
the
last
news
of
the
nobility
and
was
in
the
constant
habit
of
dining
with
lords
and
great
folks
he
spoke
of
such
with
soldierlike
respect
and
decorum
he
would
say
my
lord
bareacres
has
been
good
enough
to
invite
me
to
bareacres
for
the
pheasant
shooting
or
my
lord
steyne
is
so
kind
as
to
wish
for
my
presence
at
stillbrook
for
the
easter
holidays
and
you
may
be
sure
the
whereabouts
of
my
brother
the
major
was
carefully
made
known
by
worthy
pendennis
to
his
friends
at
the
clavering
reading
room
at
or
at
the
their
carriages
would
come
from
ten
miles
round
to
call
upon
major
pendennis
in
his
visits
to
fairoaks
the
fame
of
his
fashion
as
a
man
about
town
was
established
throughout
the
county
there
was
a
talk
of
his
marrying
miss
hunkle
of
lilybank
old
hunkle
the
daughter
with
at
least
fifteen
hundred
to
her
fortune
but
my
brother
the
major
refused
this
negotiation
advantageous
as
it
might
seem
to
most
persons
as
a
bachelor
he
said
nobody
cares
how
poor
i
am
i
have
the
happiness
to
live
with
people
who
are
so
highly
placed
in
the
world
that
a
few
hundreds
or
thousands
a
year
more
or
less
can
make
no
difference
in
the
estimation
in
which
they
are
pleased
to
hold
me
miss
hunkle
though
a
most
respectable
lady
is
not
in
possession
of
either
the
birth
or
the
manners
which
would
entitle
her
to
be
received
into
the
sphere
in
which
i
have
the
honour
to
move
i
shall
live
and
die
an
old
bachelor
john
and
your
worthy
friend
miss
hunkle
i
have
no
doubt
will
find
some
more
worthy
object
of
her
affection
than
a
old
soldier
on
time
showed
the
correctness
of
the
surmise
of
the
old
man
of
the
world
miss
hunkle
married
a
young
french
nobleman
and
is
now
at
this
moment
living
at
lilybank
under
the
title
of
baroness
de
carambole
having
been
separated
from
her
wild
young
scapegrace
of
a
baron
very
shortly
after
their
union
the
major
was
a
great
favourite
with
almost
all
the
little
establishment
of
fairoaks
he
was
as
as
he
was
well
bred
and
had
a
sincere
liking
and
regard
for
his
whom
he
pronounced
and
with
perfect
truth
to
be
as
fine
a
lady
as
any
in
england
and
an
honour
to
the
family
indeed
pendennis
tranquil
beauty
her
natural
sweetness
and
kindness
and
that
simplicity
and
dignity
which
a
perfect
purity
and
innocence
are
sure
to
bestow
upon
a
handsome
woman
rendered
her
quite
worthy
of
her
brother
praises
i
think
it
is
not
national
prejudice
which
makes
me
believe
that
a
english
lady
is
the
most
complete
of
all
heaven
subjects
in
this
world
in
whom
else
do
you
see
so
much
grace
and
so
much
virtue
so
much
faith
and
so
much
tenderness
with
such
a
perfect
refinement
and
chastity
and
by
ladies
i
do
mean
duchesses
and
countesses
be
they
ever
so
high
in
station
they
can
be
but
ladies
and
no
more
but
almost
every
man
who
lives
in
the
world
has
the
happiness
let
us
hope
of
counting
a
few
such
persons
amongst
his
circle
of
acquaintance
women
in
whose
angelical
natures
there
is
something
awful
as
well
as
beautiful
to
contemplate
at
whose
feet
the
wildest
and
fiercest
of
us
must
fall
down
and
humble
ourselves
in
admiration
of
that
adorable
purity
which
never
seems
to
do
or
to
think
wrong
arthur
pendennis
had
the
good
fortune
to
have
a
mother
endowed
with
these
happy
qualities
during
his
childhood
and
youth
the
boy
thought
of
her
as
little
less
than
an
angel
as
a
supernatural
being
all
wisdom
love
and
beauty
when
her
husband
drove
her
into
the
county
town
or
to
the
assize
balls
or
concerts
there
he
would
step
into
the
assembly
with
his
wife
on
his
arm
and
look
the
great
folks
in
the
face
as
much
as
to
say
look
at
that
my
lord
can
any
of
you
show
me
a
woman
like
that
she
enraged
some
country
ladies
with
three
times
her
money
by
a
sort
of
desperate
perfection
which
they
found
in
her
miss
pybus
said
she
was
cold
and
haughty
miss
pierce
that
she
was
too
proud
for
her
station
wapshot
as
a
doctor
of
divinity
lady
would
have
the
pas
of
her
who
was
only
the
wife
of
a
medical
practitioner
in
the
meanwhile
this
lady
moved
through
the
world
quite
regardless
of
all
the
comments
that
were
made
in
her
praise
or
disfavour
she
did
not
seem
to
know
that
she
was
admired
or
hated
for
being
so
perfect
but
carried
on
calmly
through
life
saying
her
prayers
loving
her
family
helping
her
neighbours
and
doing
her
duty
that
even
a
woman
should
be
faultless
however
is
an
arrangement
not
permitted
by
nature
which
assigns
to
us
mental
defects
as
it
awards
to
us
headaches
illnesses
or
death
without
which
the
scheme
of
the
world
could
not
be
carried
on
nay
some
of
the
best
qualities
of
mankind
could
not
be
brought
into
exercise
as
pain
produces
or
elicits
fortitude
and
endurance
difficulty
perseverance
poverty
industry
and
ingenuity
danger
courage
and
what
not
so
the
very
virtues
on
the
other
hand
will
generate
some
vices
and
in
fine
pendennis
had
that
vice
which
miss
pybus
and
miss
pierce
discovered
in
her
namely
that
of
pride
which
did
not
vest
itself
so
much
in
her
own
person
as
in
that
of
her
family
she
spoke
about
pendennis
a
worthy
little
gentleman
enough
but
there
are
others
as
good
as
he
with
an
awful
reverence
as
if
he
had
been
the
pope
of
rome
on
his
throne
and
she
a
cardinal
kneeling
at
his
feet
and
giving
him
incense
the
major
she
held
to
be
a
sort
of
bayard
among
majors
and
as
for
her
son
arthur
she
worshipped
that
youth
with
an
ardour
which
the
young
scapegrace
accepted
almost
as
coolly
as
the
statue
of
the
saint
in
saint
peter
receives
the
rapturous
osculations
which
the
faithful
deliver
on
his
toe
this
unfortunate
superstition
and
of
this
good
woman
was
the
cause
of
a
great
deal
of
the
misfortune
which
befell
the
young
gentleman
who
is
the
hero
of
this
history
and
deserves
therefore
to
be
mentioned
at
the
outset
of
his
story
arthur
pendennis
schoolfellows
at
the
greyfriars
school
state
that
as
a
boy
he
was
in
no
ways
remarkable
either
as
a
dunce
or
as
a
scholar
he
did
in
fact
just
as
much
as
was
required
of
him
and
no
more
if
he
was
distinguished
for
anything
it
was
for
but
was
his
enthusiasm
ever
so
great
it
stopped
when
he
had
composed
the
number
of
lines
demanded
by
the
regulations
unlike
young
swettenham
for
instance
who
with
no
more
of
poetry
in
his
composition
than
wakley
yet
would
bring
up
a
hundred
dreary
hexameters
to
the
master
after
a
or
young
fluxmore
who
not
only
did
his
own
verses
but
all
the
fifth
form
besides
he
never
read
to
improve
himself
out
of
but
on
the
contrary
devoured
all
the
novels
plays
and
poetry
on
which
he
could
lay
his
hands
he
never
was
flogged
but
it
was
a
wonder
how
he
escaped
the
when
he
had
money
he
spent
it
royally
in
tarts
for
himself
and
his
friends
he
has
been
known
to
disburse
nine
and
sixpence
out
of
ten
shillings
awarded
to
him
in
a
single
day
when
he
had
no
funds
he
went
on
tick
when
he
could
get
no
credit
he
went
without
and
was
almost
as
happy
he
has
been
known
to
take
a
thrashing
for
a
crony
without
saying
a
word
but
a
blow
ever
so
slight
from
a
friend
would
make
him
roar
to
fighting
he
was
averse
from
his
earliest
youth
as
indeed
to
physic
the
greek
grammar
or
any
other
exertion
and
would
engage
in
none
of
them
except
at
the
last
extremity
he
seldom
if
ever
told
lies
and
never
bullied
little
boys
those
masters
or
seniors
who
were
kind
to
him
he
loved
with
boyish
ardour
and
though
the
doctor
when
he
did
not
know
his
horace
or
could
not
construe
his
greek
play
said
that
that
boy
pendennis
was
a
disgrace
to
the
school
a
candidate
for
ruin
in
this
world
and
perdition
in
the
next
a
profligate
who
would
most
likely
bring
his
venerable
father
to
ruin
and
his
mother
to
a
dishonoured
grave
and
the
like
yet
as
the
doctor
made
use
of
these
compliments
to
most
of
the
boys
in
the
place
which
has
not
turned
out
an
unusual
number
of
felons
and
pickpockets
little
pen
at
first
uneasy
and
terrified
by
these
charges
became
gradually
accustomed
to
hear
them
and
he
has
not
in
fact
either
murdered
his
parents
or
committed
any
act
worthy
of
transportation
or
hanging
up
to
the
present
day
there
were
many
of
the
upper
boys
among
the
cistercians
with
whom
pendennis
was
educated
who
assumed
all
the
privileges
of
men
long
before
they
quitted
that
seminary
many
of
them
for
example
smoked
cigars
and
some
had
already
begun
the
practice
of
inebriation
one
had
fought
a
duel
with
an
ensign
in
a
marching
in
consequence
of
a
row
at
the
theatre
another
actually
kept
a
buggy
and
horse
at
a
livery
stable
in
covent
garden
and
might
be
seen
driving
any
sunday
in
hyde
park
with
a
groom
with
squared
arms
and
armorial
buttons
by
his
side
many
of
the
seniors
were
in
love
and
showed
each
other
in
confidence
poems
addressed
to
or
letters
and
locks
of
hair
received
from
young
ladies
but
pen
a
modest
and
timid
youth
rather
envied
these
than
imitated
them
as
yet
he
had
not
got
beyond
the
theory
as
yet
the
practice
of
life
was
all
to
come
and
by
the
way
ye
tender
mothers
and
sober
fathers
of
christian
families
a
prodigious
thing
that
theory
of
life
is
as
orally
learned
at
a
great
public
school
why
if
you
could
hear
those
boys
of
fourteen
who
blush
before
mothers
and
sneak
off
in
silence
in
the
presence
of
their
daughters
talking
among
each
other
it
would
be
the
women
turn
to
blush
then
before
he
was
twelve
years
old
and
if
while
his
mother
fancied
him
an
angel
of
candour
little
pen
had
heard
talk
enough
to
make
him
quite
awfully
wise
upon
certain
points
and
so
madam
has
your
pretty
little
son
who
is
coming
home
from
school
for
the
ensuing
christmas
holidays
i
do
say
that
the
boy
is
lost
or
that
the
innocence
has
left
him
which
he
had
from
which
is
our
home
but
that
the
shades
of
the
are
closing
very
fast
over
him
and
that
we
are
helping
as
much
as
possible
to
corrupt
him
well
pen
had
just
made
his
public
appearance
in
a
coat
with
a
tail
or
cauda
virilis
and
was
looking
most
anxiously
in
his
little
to
see
if
his
whiskers
were
growing
like
those
of
more
fortunate
youths
his
companions
and
instead
of
the
treble
voice
with
which
he
used
to
speak
and
sing
for
his
singing
voice
was
a
very
sweet
one
and
he
used
when
little
to
be
made
to
perform
sweet
home
pretty
page
and
a
french
song
or
two
which
his
mother
had
taught
him
and
other
ballads
for
the
delectation
of
the
senior
boys
had
suddenly
plunged
into
a
deep
bass
diversified
by
a
squeak
which
when
he
was
called
upon
to
construe
in
school
set
the
master
and
scholars
laughing
he
was
about
sixteen
years
old
in
a
word
when
he
was
suddenly
called
away
from
his
academic
studies
it
was
at
the
close
of
the
forenoon
school
and
pen
had
been
unnoticed
all
the
previous
part
of
the
morning
till
now
when
the
doctor
put
him
on
to
construe
in
a
greek
play
he
did
not
know
a
word
of
it
though
little
timmins
his
was
prompting
him
with
all
his
might
pen
had
made
a
sad
blunder
or
two
when
the
awful
chief
broke
out
upon
him
pendennis
sir
he
said
your
idleness
is
incorrigible
and
your
stupidity
beyond
example
you
are
a
disgrace
to
your
school
and
to
your
family
and
i
have
no
doubt
will
prove
so
in
to
your
country
if
that
vice
sir
which
is
described
to
us
as
the
root
of
all
evil
be
really
what
moralists
have
represented
and
i
have
no
doubt
of
the
correctness
of
their
opinion
for
what
a
prodigious
quantity
of
future
crime
and
wickedness
are
you
unhappy
boy
laying
the
seed
miserable
trifler
a
boy
who
construes
de
and
instead
of
de
but
at
sixteen
years
of
age
is
guilty
not
merely
of
folly
and
ignorance
and
dulness
inconceivable
but
of
crime
of
deadly
crime
of
filial
ingratitude
which
i
tremble
to
contemplate
a
boy
sir
who
does
not
learn
his
greek
play
cheats
the
parent
who
spends
money
for
his
education
a
boy
who
cheats
his
parent
is
not
very
far
from
robbing
or
forging
upon
his
neighbour
a
man
who
forges
on
his
neighbour
pays
the
penalty
of
his
crime
at
the
gallows
and
it
is
not
such
a
one
that
i
pity
for
he
will
be
deservedly
cut
off
but
his
maddened
and
parents
who
are
driven
to
a
premature
grave
by
his
crimes
or
if
they
live
drag
on
a
wretched
and
dishonoured
old
age
go
on
sir
and
i
warn
you
that
the
very
next
mistake
that
you
make
shall
subject
you
to
the
punishment
of
the
rod
who
that
laughing
what
boy
is
there
that
dares
to
laugh
shouted
the
doctor
indeed
while
the
master
was
making
this
oration
there
was
a
general
titter
behind
him
in
the
schoolroom
the
orator
had
his
back
to
the
door
of
this
ancient
apartment
which
was
open
and
a
gentleman
who
was
quite
familiar
with
the
place
for
both
major
arthur
and
john
pendennis
had
been
at
the
school
was
asking
the
boy
who
sate
by
the
door
for
pendennis
the
lad
grinning
pointed
to
the
culprit
against
whom
the
doctor
was
pouring
out
the
thunders
of
his
just
wrath
major
pendennis
could
not
help
laughing
he
remembered
having
stood
under
that
very
pillar
where
pen
the
younger
now
stood
and
having
been
assaulted
by
the
doctor
predecessor
years
and
years
ago
the
intelligence
was
round
that
it
was
pendennis
uncle
in
an
instant
and
a
hundred
young
faces
wondering
and
giggling
between
terror
and
laughter
turned
now
to
the
and
then
to
the
awful
doctor
the
major
asked
the
boy
to
carry
his
card
up
to
the
doctor
which
the
lad
did
with
an
arch
look
major
pendennis
had
written
on
the
card
i
must
take
home
his
father
is
very
as
the
doctor
received
the
card
and
stopped
his
harangue
with
rather
a
scared
look
the
laughter
of
the
boys
half
constrained
until
then
burst
out
in
a
general
shout
silence
roared
out
the
doctor
stamping
with
his
foot
pen
looked
up
and
saw
who
was
his
deliverer
the
major
beckoned
to
him
gravely
with
one
of
his
white
gloves
and
tumbling
down
his
books
pen
went
across
the
doctor
took
out
his
watch
it
was
two
minutes
to
one
we
will
take
the
juvenal
at
afternoon
school
he
said
nodding
to
the
captain
and
all
the
boys
understanding
the
signal
gathered
up
their
books
and
poured
out
of
the
hall
young
pen
saw
by
his
uncle
face
that
something
had
happened
at
home
is
there
anything
the
matter
with
my
mother
he
said
he
could
hardly
speak
though
for
emotion
and
the
tears
which
were
ready
to
start
no
said
the
major
but
your
father
very
go
and
pack
your
trunk
directly
i
have
got
a
postchaise
at
the
pen
went
off
quickly
to
his
to
do
as
his
uncle
bade
him
and
the
doctor
now
left
alone
in
the
schoolroom
came
out
to
shake
hands
with
his
old
schoolfellow
you
would
not
have
thought
it
was
the
same
man
as
cinderella
at
a
particular
hour
became
from
a
blazing
and
magnificent
princess
quite
an
ordinary
little
maid
in
a
grey
petticoat
so
as
the
clock
struck
one
all
the
thundering
majesty
and
awful
wrath
of
the
schoolmaster
disappeared
there
is
nothing
serious
i
hope
said
the
doctor
it
is
a
pity
to
take
the
boy
away
unless
there
is
he
is
a
very
good
boy
rather
idle
and
unenergetic
but
he
is
a
very
honest
gentlemanlike
little
fellow
though
i
ca
get
him
to
construe
as
i
wish
wo
you
come
in
and
have
some
luncheon
my
wife
will
be
very
happy
to
see
but
major
pendennis
declined
the
luncheon
he
said
his
brother
was
very
ill
had
had
a
fit
the
day
before
and
it
was
a
great
question
if
they
should
see
him
alive
there
no
other
son
is
there
said
the
doctor
the
major
answered
and
there
a
good
eh
a
good
eh
property
i
believe
asked
the
other
in
an
way
h
so
so
said
the
major
whereupon
this
colloquy
came
to
an
end
and
arthur
pendennis
got
into
the
postchaise
with
his
uncle
never
to
come
back
to
school
any
more
as
the
chaise
drove
through
clavering
the
hostler
standing
whistling
under
the
archway
of
the
clavering
arms
winked
the
postilion
ominously
as
much
as
to
say
all
was
over
the
gardener
wife
came
and
opened
the
and
let
the
travellers
through
with
a
silent
shake
of
the
head
all
the
blinds
were
down
at
fairoaks
the
face
of
the
old
footman
was
as
blank
when
he
let
them
in
arthur
face
was
white
too
with
terror
more
than
with
grief
whatever
of
warmth
and
love
the
deceased
man
might
have
had
and
he
adored
his
wife
and
loved
and
admired
his
son
with
all
his
heart
he
had
shut
them
up
within
himself
nor
had
the
boy
been
ever
able
to
penetrate
that
frigid
outward
barrier
but
arthur
had
been
his
father
pride
and
glory
through
life
and
his
name
the
last
which
john
pendennis
had
tried
to
articulate
whilst
he
lay
with
his
wife
hand
clasping
his
own
cold
and
clammy
palm
as
the
flickering
spirit
went
out
into
the
darkness
of
death
and
life
and
the
world
passed
away
from
him
the
little
girl
whose
face
had
peered
for
a
moment
under
the
blinds
as
the
chaise
came
up
opened
the
door
from
the
stairs
into
the
hall
and
taking
arthur
hand
silently
as
he
stooped
down
to
kiss
her
led
him
upstairs
to
his
mother
old
john
opened
the
door
for
the
major
the
room
was
darkened
with
the
blinds
down
and
surrounded
by
all
the
gloomy
pictures
of
the
pendennises
he
drank
a
glass
of
wine
the
bottle
had
been
opened
for
the
squire
four
days
before
his
hat
was
brushed
and
laid
on
the
hall
table
his
newspapers
and
his
with
john
pendennis
esquire
fairoaks
engraved
upon
the
brass
plate
were
there
in
waiting
the
doctor
and
the
lawyer
from
clavering
who
had
seen
the
chaise
pass
through
came
up
in
a
gig
half
an
hour
after
the
major
arrival
and
entered
by
the
back
door
the
former
gave
a
detailed
account
of
the
seizure
and
demise
of
pendennis
enlarged
on
his
virtues
and
the
estimation
in
which
the
neighbourhood
held
him
on
what
a
loss
he
would
be
to
the
magistrates
bench
the
county
hospital
etc
pendennis
bore
up
wonderfully
he
said
especially
since
master
arthur
arrival
the
lawyer
stayed
and
dined
with
major
pendennis
and
they
talked
business
all
the
evening
the
major
was
his
brother
executor
and
joint
guardian
to
the
boy
with
pendennis
everything
was
left
unreservedly
to
her
except
in
case
of
a
second
marriage
an
occasion
which
might
offer
itself
in
the
case
of
so
young
and
handsome
a
woman
tatham
gallantly
said
when
different
provisions
were
enacted
by
the
deceased
the
major
would
of
course
take
entire
superintendence
of
everything
under
this
most
impressive
and
melancholy
occasion
aware
of
this
authority
old
john
the
footman
when
he
brought
major
pendennis
the
candle
to
go
to
bed
followed
afterwards
with
the
and
the
next
morning
brought
him
the
key
of
the
hall
clock
the
squire
always
used
to
wind
it
up
of
a
thursday
john
said
pendennis
maid
brought
him
messages
from
her
mistress
she
confirmed
the
doctor
report
of
the
comfort
which
master
arrival
had
caused
to
his
mother
what
passed
between
that
lady
and
the
boy
is
not
of
import
a
veil
should
be
thrown
over
those
sacred
emotions
of
love
and
grief
the
maternal
passion
is
a
sacred
mystery
to
me
what
one
sees
symbolised
in
the
roman
churches
in
the
image
of
the
virgin
mother
with
a
bosom
bleeding
with
love
i
think
one
may
witness
and
admire
the
almighty
bounty
for
every
day
i
saw
a
jewish
lady
only
yesterday
with
a
child
at
her
knee
and
from
whose
face
towards
the
child
there
shone
a
sweetness
so
angelical
that
it
seemed
to
form
a
sort
of
glory
round
both
i
protest
i
could
have
knelt
before
her
too
and
adored
in
her
the
divine
beneficence
in
endowing
us
with
the
maternal
storge
which
began
with
our
race
and
sanctifies
the
history
of
mankind
so
it
was
with
this
in
a
word
that
pendennis
comforted
herself
on
the
death
of
her
husband
whom
however
she
always
reverenced
as
the
best
the
most
upright
wise
accomplished
and
awful
of
men
if
the
women
did
not
make
idols
of
us
and
if
they
saw
us
as
we
see
each
other
would
life
be
bearable
or
could
society
go
on
let
a
man
pray
that
none
of
his
womankind
should
form
a
just
estimation
of
him
if
your
wife
knew
you
as
you
are
neighbour
she
would
not
grieve
much
about
being
your
widow
and
would
let
your
go
out
very
soon
or
perhaps
not
even
take
the
trouble
to
light
it
whereas
helen
pendennis
put
up
the
handsomest
of
memorials
to
her
husband
and
constantly
renewed
it
with
the
most
precious
oil
as
for
arthur
pendennis
after
that
awful
shock
which
the
sight
of
his
dead
father
must
have
produced
on
him
and
the
pity
and
feeling
which
such
an
event
no
doubt
occasioned
i
am
not
sure
that
in
the
very
moment
of
the
grief
and
as
he
embraced
his
mother
and
tenderly
consoled
her
and
promised
to
love
her
for
ever
there
was
not
springing
up
in
his
breast
a
feeling
of
secret
triumph
and
exultation
he
was
the
chief
now
and
lord
he
was
pendennis
and
all
round
about
him
were
his
servants
and
handmaids
you
never
send
me
away
little
laura
said
tripping
by
him
and
holding
his
hand
you
wo
send
me
to
school
will
you
arthur
arthur
kissed
her
and
patted
her
head
no
she
should
go
to
school
as
for
going
himself
that
was
quite
out
of
the
question
he
had
determined
that
that
part
of
his
life
should
not
be
renewed
in
the
midst
of
the
general
grief
and
the
corpse
still
lying
above
he
had
leisure
to
conclude
that
he
would
have
it
all
holidays
for
the
future
that
he
would
get
up
till
he
liked
or
stand
the
bullying
of
the
doctor
any
more
and
had
made
a
hundred
of
such
and
resolves
for
the
future
how
one
thoughts
will
travel
and
how
quickly
our
wishes
beget
them
when
he
with
laura
in
his
hand
went
into
the
kitchen
on
his
way
to
the
the
and
other
his
favourite
haunts
all
the
servants
there
assembled
in
great
silence
with
their
friends
and
the
labouring
men
and
their
wives
and
sally
potter
who
went
with
the
to
clavering
and
the
baker
man
from
clavering
all
there
assembled
and
drinking
beer
on
the
melancholy
occasion
rose
up
on
his
entrance
and
bowed
or
curtseyed
to
him
they
never
used
to
do
so
last
holidays
he
felt
at
once
and
with
indescribable
pleasure
the
cook
cried
out
o
lord
and
whispered
how
master
arthur
do
grow
thomas
the
groom
in
the
act
of
drinking
put
down
the
jug
alarmed
before
his
master
thomas
master
felt
the
honour
keenly
he
went
through
and
looked
at
the
pointers
as
flora
put
her
nose
up
to
his
waistcoat
and
ponto
yelling
with
pleasure
hurtled
at
his
chain
pen
patronised
the
dogs
and
said
poo
ponto
poo
flora
in
his
most
condescending
manner
and
then
he
went
and
looked
at
hens
and
at
the
pigs
and
at
the
orchard
and
at
the
dairy
perhaps
he
blushed
to
think
that
it
was
only
last
holidays
he
had
in
a
manner
robbed
the
great
and
been
scolded
by
the
dairymaid
for
taking
cream
they
buried
john
pendennis
esquire
formerly
an
eminent
medical
practitioner
at
bath
and
subsequently
an
able
magistrate
a
benevolent
landlord
and
a
benefactor
to
many
charities
and
public
institutions
in
this
neighbourhood
and
county
with
one
of
the
most
handsome
funerals
that
had
been
seen
since
sir
roger
clavering
was
buried
here
the
clerk
said
in
the
abbey
church
of
clavering
mary
a
fair
marble
slab
from
which
the
above
inscription
is
copied
was
erected
over
the
fairoaks
pew
in
the
church
on
it
you
may
see
the
pendennis
coat
of
arms
and
crest
an
eagle
looking
towards
the
sun
with
the
motto
tenui
penna
to
the
present
day
doctor
portman
alluded
to
the
deceased
most
handsomely
and
affectingly
as
our
dear
departed
friend
in
his
sermon
next
sunday
and
arthur
pendennis
reigned
in
his
stead
chapter
iii
in
which
pendennis
appears
as
a
very
young
man
indeed
arthur
was
about
sixteen
years
old
we
have
said
when
he
began
to
reign
in
person
for
i
see
that
the
artist
who
is
to
illustrate
this
book
and
who
makes
sad
work
of
the
likeness
will
never
be
able
to
take
my
friend
off
he
had
what
his
friends
would
call
a
dumpy
but
his
mamma
styled
a
neat
little
figure
his
hair
was
of
a
healthy
brown
colour
which
looks
like
gold
in
the
sunshine
his
face
was
round
rosy
freckled
and
his
whiskers
when
those
facial
ornaments
for
which
he
sighed
so
ardently
were
awarded
to
him
by
nature
were
decidedly
of
a
reddish
hue
in
fact
without
being
a
beauty
he
had
such
a
frank
kind
face
and
laughed
so
merrily
at
you
out
of
his
honest
blue
eyes
that
no
wonder
pendennis
thought
him
the
pride
of
the
whole
county
between
the
ages
of
sixteen
and
eighteen
he
rose
from
five
feet
six
to
five
feet
eight
inches
in
height
at
which
altitude
he
paused
but
his
mother
wondered
at
it
he
was
three
inches
taller
than
his
father
was
it
possible
that
any
man
could
grow
to
be
three
inches
taller
than
pendennis
you
may
be
certain
he
never
went
back
to
school
the
discipline
of
the
establishment
did
not
suit
him
and
he
liked
being
at
home
much
better
the
question
of
his
return
was
debated
and
his
uncle
was
for
his
going
back
the
doctor
wrote
his
opinion
that
it
was
most
important
for
arthur
success
in
that
he
should
know
a
greek
play
thoroughly
but
pen
adroitly
managed
to
hint
to
his
mother
what
a
dangerous
place
greyfriars
was
and
what
sad
wild
fellows
some
of
the
chaps
there
were
and
the
timid
soul
taking
alarm
at
once
acceded
to
his
desire
to
stay
at
home
then
pen
uncle
offered
to
use
his
influence
with
his
royal
highness
the
who
was
pleased
to
be
very
kind
to
him
and
proposed
to
get
pen
a
commission
in
the
foot
guards
pen
heart
leaped
at
this
he
had
been
to
hear
the
band
at
james
play
on
a
sunday
when
he
went
out
to
his
uncle
he
had
seen
tom
ricketts
of
the
fourth
form
who
used
to
wear
a
jacket
and
trousers
so
ludicrously
tight
that
the
elder
boys
could
not
forbear
using
him
in
the
quality
of
a
butt
or
he
had
seen
this
very
ricketts
arrayed
in
crimson
and
gold
with
an
immense
cap
on
his
head
staggering
under
the
colours
of
the
regiment
tom
had
recognised
him
and
gave
him
a
patronising
nod
tom
a
little
wretch
whom
he
had
cut
over
the
back
with
a
last
quarter
and
there
he
was
in
the
centre
of
the
square
rallying
round
the
flag
of
his
country
surrounded
by
bayonets
crossbelts
and
scarlet
the
band
blowing
trumpets
and
banging
cymbals
talking
familiarly
to
immense
warriors
with
tufts
to
their
chins
and
waterloo
medals
what
would
not
pen
have
given
to
wear
such
epaulettes
and
enter
such
a
service
but
helen
pendennis
when
this
point
was
proposed
to
her
by
her
son
put
on
a
face
full
of
terror
and
alarm
she
said
she
did
not
quarrel
with
others
who
thought
differently
but
that
in
her
opinion
a
christian
had
no
right
to
make
the
army
a
profession
pendennis
never
never
would
have
permitted
his
son
to
be
a
soldier
finally
she
should
be
very
unhappy
if
he
thought
of
now
pen
would
have
as
soon
cut
off
his
nose
and
ears
as
deliberately
and
of
aforethought
malice
made
his
mother
unhappy
and
as
he
was
of
such
a
generous
disposition
that
he
would
give
away
anything
to
any
one
he
instantly
made
a
present
of
his
visionary
red
coat
and
epaulettes
and
his
ardour
for
military
glory
to
his
mother
she
thought
him
the
noblest
creature
in
the
world
but
major
pendennis
when
the
offer
of
the
commission
was
acknowledged
and
refused
wrote
back
a
curt
and
somewhat
angry
letter
to
the
widow
and
thought
his
nephew
was
rather
a
spooney
he
was
contented
however
when
he
saw
the
boy
performances
out
hunting
at
christmas
when
the
major
came
down
as
usual
to
fairoaks
pen
had
a
very
good
mare
and
rode
her
with
uncommon
pluck
and
grace
he
took
his
fences
with
great
coolness
and
yet
with
judgment
and
without
bravado
he
wrote
to
the
chaps
at
school
about
his
and
his
feats
across
country
he
began
to
think
seriously
of
a
scarlet
coat
and
his
mother
must
own
that
she
thought
it
would
become
him
remarkably
well
though
of
course
she
passed
hours
of
anguish
during
his
absence
and
daily
expected
to
see
him
brought
home
on
a
shutter
with
these
amusements
in
rather
too
great
plenty
it
must
not
be
assumed
that
pen
neglected
his
studies
altogether
he
had
a
natural
taste
for
reading
every
possible
kind
of
book
which
did
not
fall
into
his
it
was
only
when
they
forced
his
head
into
the
waters
of
knowledge
that
he
refused
to
drink
he
devoured
all
the
books
at
home
from
inchbald
theatre
to
white
farriery
he
ransacked
the
neighbouring
he
found
at
clavering
an
old
cargo
of
french
novels
which
he
read
with
all
his
might
and
he
would
sit
for
hours
perched
upon
the
topmost
bar
of
doctor
portman
library
steps
with
a
folio
on
his
knees
whether
it
were
hakluyt
travels
leviathan
augustini
opera
or
chaucer
poems
he
and
the
vicar
were
very
good
friends
and
from
his
reverence
pen
learned
that
honest
taste
for
port
wine
which
distinguished
him
through
life
and
as
for
that
dear
good
woman
portman
who
was
not
in
the
least
jealous
though
her
doctor
avowed
himself
in
love
with
pendennis
whom
he
pronounced
to
be
by
far
the
finest
lady
in
the
county
all
her
grief
was
as
she
looked
up
fondly
at
pen
perched
on
the
that
her
daughter
minny
was
too
old
for
him
as
indeed
she
was
miss
myra
portman
being
at
that
period
only
two
years
younger
than
pen
mother
and
weighing
as
much
as
pen
and
pendennis
together
are
these
details
insipid
look
back
good
friend
at
your
own
youth
and
ask
how
was
that
i
like
to
think
of
a
boy
brave
and
gentle
and
loving
and
looking
the
world
in
the
face
with
kind
honest
eyes
what
bright
colours
it
wore
then
and
how
you
enjoyed
it
a
man
has
not
many
years
of
such
time
he
does
not
know
them
whilst
they
are
with
him
it
is
only
when
they
are
passed
long
away
that
he
remembers
how
dear
and
happy
they
were
in
order
to
keep
mr
pen
from
indulging
in
that
idleness
of
which
his
friend
the
doctor
of
the
cistercians
had
prophesied
such
awful
consequences
smirke
portman
curate
was
engaged
at
a
liberal
salary
to
walk
or
ride
over
from
clavering
and
pass
several
hours
daily
with
the
young
gentleman
smirke
was
a
man
perfectly
faultless
at
a
wore
a
curl
on
his
fair
forehead
and
tied
his
with
a
melancholy
grace
he
was
a
decent
scholar
and
mathematician
and
taught
pen
as
much
as
the
lad
was
ever
disposed
to
learn
which
was
not
much
for
pen
had
soon
taken
the
measure
of
his
tutor
who
when
he
came
riding
into
the
at
fairoaks
on
his
pony
turned
out
his
toes
so
absurdly
and
left
such
a
gap
between
his
knees
and
the
saddle
that
it
was
impossible
for
any
lad
endowed
with
a
sense
of
humour
to
respect
such
an
equestrian
he
nearly
killed
smirke
with
terror
by
putting
him
on
his
mare
and
taking
him
a
ride
over
a
common
where
the
county
then
bunted
by
that
staunch
old
sportsman
hardhead
of
dumplingbeare

to
meet
smirke
on
pen
mare
rebecca
she
was
named
after
pen
favourite
heroine
the
daughter
of
isaac
of
york
astounded
the
hounds
as
much
as
he
disgusted
the
huntsman
laming
one
of
the
former
by
persisting
in
riding
amongst
the
pack
and
receiving
a
speech
from
the
latter
more
remarkable
for
energy
of
language
than
any
oration
he
had
ever
heard
since
he
left
the
bargemen
on
the
banks
of
isis
smirke
confided
to
his
pupil
his
poems
both
latin
and
english
and
presented
to
pendennis
a
volume
of
the
latter
printed
at
clapham
his
native
place
the
two
read
the
ancient
poets
together
and
rattled
through
them
at
a
pleasant
rate
very
different
from
that
steady
grubbing
pace
with
which
the
cistercians
used
to
go
over
the
classic
ground
scenting
out
each
word
as
they
went
and
digging
up
every
root
in
the
way
pen
never
liked
to
halt
but
made
his
tutor
construe
when
he
was
at
fault
and
thus
galloped
through
the
iliad
and
the
odyssey
the
tragic
playwriters
writers
and
the
charming
wicked
aristophanes
whom
he
vowed
to
be
the
greatest
poet
of
all
but
he
went
at
such
a
pace
that
though
he
certainly
galloped
through
a
considerable
extent
of
the
ancient
country
he
clean
forgot
it
in
and
had
only
such
a
vague
remembrance
of
his
early
classic
course
as
a
man
has
in
the
house
of
commons
let
us
say
who
still
keeps
up
two
or
three
quotations
or
a
reviewer
who
just
for
decency
sake
hints
at
a
little
greek
our
people
are
the
most
prosaic
in
the
world
but
the
most
faithful
and
with
curious
reverence
we
keep
up
and
transmit
from
generation
to
generation
the
superstition
of
what
we
call
the
education
of
a
gentleman
besides
the
ancient
poets
you
may
be
sure
pen
read
the
english
with
great
gusto
smirke
sighed
and
shook
his
head
sadly
both
about
byron
and
moore
but
pen
was
a
sworn
and
a
corsair
he
had
them
by
heart
and
used
to
take
little
laura
into
the
window
and
say
zuleika
i
am
not
thy
brother
in
tones
so
tragic
that
they
caused
the
solemn
little
maid
to
open
her
great
eyes
still
wider
she
sat
until
the
proper
hour
for
retirement
sewing
at
pendennis
knee
and
listening
to
pen
reading
out
to
her
of
nights
without
comprehending
one
word
of
what
he
read
he
read
shakspeare
to
his
mother
which
she
said
she
liked
but
did
and
byron
and
pope
and
his
favourite
lalla
rookh
which
pleased
her
indifferently
but
as
for
bishop
heber
and
hemans
above
all
this
lady
used
to
melt
right
away
and
be
absorbed
into
her
when
pen
read
those
authors
to
her
in
his
kind
boyish
voice
the
year
was
a
book
which
appeared
about
that
time
the
son
and
the
mother
whispered
it
to
each
other
with
awe
faint
very
faint
and
seldom
in
pendennis
heard
that
solemn
but
he
always
loved
the
remembrance
of
it
and
of
the
times
when
it
struck
on
his
heart
and
he
walked
over
the
fields
full
of
hope
and
void
of
doubt
as
the
rang
on
sunday
morning
it
was
at
this
period
of
his
existence
that
pen
broke
out
in
the
corner
of
the
county
chronicle
with
some
verses
with
which
he
was
perfectly
well
satisfied
his
are
the
verses
signed
addressed
a
tear
the
anniversary
of
the
battle
of
waterloo
madame
caradori
singing
at
the
assize
meetings
saint
bartholomew
a
tremendous
denunciation
of
popery
and
a
solemn
warning
to
the
people
of
england
to
rally
against
emancipating
the
roman
catholics
all
which
masterpieces
pendennis
no
doubt
keeps
to
this
day
along
with
his
first
socks
the
first
cutting
of
his
hair
his
bottle
and
other
interesting
relics
of
his
infancy
he
used
to
gallop
rebecca
over
the
neighbouring
dumpling
downs
or
into
the
county
town
which
if
you
please
we
shall
call
chatteris
spouting
his
own
poems
and
filled
with
quite
a
byronic
afflatus
as
he
thought
his
genius
at
this
time
was
of
a
decidedly
gloomy
cast
he
brought
his
mother
a
tragedy
in
which
though
he
killed
sixteen
people
before
the
second
act
it
made
her
laugh
so
that
he
thrust
the
masterpiece
into
the
fire
in
a
pet
he
projected
an
epic
poem
in
blank
verse
or
the
conqueror
of
mexico
and
the
inca
daughter
he
wrote
part
of
or
the
fatal
bath
and
in
naxos
classical
pieces
with
choruses
and
strophes
and
antistrophes
which
sadly
puzzled
poor
pendennis
and
began
a
of
the
jesuits
in
which
he
lashed
that
order
with
tremendous
severity
and
warned
his
protestant
of
their
machinations
his
loyalty
did
his
heart
good
to
witness
he
was
a
staunch
unflinching
man
in
those
days
and
at
the
election
when
sir
giles
beanfield
stood
on
the
blue
interest
against
lord
trehawk
lord
eyrie
son
a
whig
and
a
friend
of
popery
arthur
pendennis
with
an
immense
bow
for
himself
which
his
mother
made
and
with
a
blue
ribbon
for
rebecca
rode
alongside
of
the
reverend
doctor
portman
on
his
grey
mare
dowdy
and
at
the
head
of
the
clavering
voters
whom
the
doctor
brought
up
to
plump
for
the
protestant
champion
on
that
day
pen
made
his
first
speech
at
the
blue
hotel
and
also
it
appears
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
took
a
little
more
wine
than
was
good
for
him
mercy
what
a
scene
it
was
at
fairoaks
when
he
rode
back
at
ever
so
much
at
night
what
moving
about
of
lanterns
in
the
and
stables
though
the
moon
was
shining
out
what
a
gathering
of
servants
as
pen
came
home
clattering
over
the
bridge
and
up
the
stableyard
with
half
a
score
of
the
clavering
voters
yelling
after
him
the
blue
song
of
the
election
he
wanted
them
all
to
come
in
and
have
some
wine
some
very
good
madeira
some
capital
madeira
john
go
and
get
some
madeira
and
there
is
no
knowing
what
the
farmers
would
have
done
had
not
madam
pendennis
made
her
appearance
in
a
white
wrapper
with
a
candle
and
scared
those
zealous
blues
so
by
the
sight
of
her
pale
handsome
face
that
they
touched
their
hats
and
rode
off
besides
these
amusements
and
occupations
in
which
mr
pen
indulged
there
was
one
which
forms
the
main
business
and
pleasure
of
youth
if
the
poets
tell
us
aright
whom
pen
was
always
studying
and
this
young
fellow
heart
was
so
ardent
and
his
imagination
so
eager
that
it
is
not
to
be
expected
he
should
long
escape
the
passion
to
which
we
allude
and
which
ladies
you
have
rightly
guessed
to
be
that
of
love
pen
sighed
for
it
first
in
secret
and
like
the
swain
in
ovid
opened
his
breast
and
said
aura
what
generous
youth
is
there
that
has
not
courted
some
such
windy
mistress
in
his
time
yes
pen
began
to
feel
the
necessity
of
a
first
love
of
a
consuming
passion
of
an
object
on
which
he
could
concentrate
all
those
vague
floating
fancies
under
which
he
sweetly
suffered
of
a
young
lady
to
whom
he
could
really
make
verses
and
whom
he
could
set
up
and
adore
in
place
of
those
unsubstantial
ianthes
and
zuleikas
to
whom
he
addressed
the
outpourings
of
his
gushing
muse
he
read
his
favourite
poems
over
and
over
again
he
called
upon
alma
venus
the
delight
of
gods
and
men
he
translated
anacreon
odes
and
picked
out
passages
suitable
to
his
complaint
from
waller
dryden
prior
and
the
like
smirke
and
he
were
never
weary
in
their
interviews
of
discoursing
about
love
the
faithless
tutor
entertained
him
with
sentimental
conversations
in
place
of
lectures
on
algebra
and
greek
for
smirke
was
in
love
too
who
could
help
it
being
in
daily
intercourse
with
such
a
woman
smirke
was
madly
in
love
as
far
as
such
a
mild
flame
as
smirke
may
be
called
madness
with
pendennis
that
honest
lady
sitting
down
below
stairs
teaching
little
laura
to
play
the
piano
or
devising
flannel
petticoats
for
the
poor
round
about
her
or
otherwise
busied
with
the
calm
routine
of
her
modest
and
spotless
christian
life
was
little
aware
what
storms
were
brewing
in
two
bosoms
upstairs
in
the
study
in
pen
as
he
sate
in
his
shooting
jacket
with
his
elbows
on
the
green
and
his
hands
clutching
his
curly
brown
hair
homer
under
his
nose
and
in
worthy
smirke
with
whom
he
was
reading
here
they
would
talk
about
helen
and
andromache
andromache
like
my
mother
pen
used
to
avouch
but
i
say
smirke
by
jove
i
cut
off
my
nose
to
see
helen
and
he
would
spout
certain
favourite
lines
which
the
reader
will
find
in
their
proper
place
in
the
third
book
he
drew
portraits
of
her
they
are
extant
still
with
straight
noses
and
enormous
eyes
and
pendennis
delineavit
et
pinxit
gallantly
written
underneath
as
for
smirke
he
naturally
preferred
andromache
and
in
consequence
he
was
uncommonly
kind
to
pen
he
gave
him
his
elzevir
horace
of
which
the
boy
was
fond
and
his
little
greek
testament
which
his
own
mamma
at
clapham
had
purchased
and
presented
to
him
he
bought
him
a
silver
and
in
the
matter
of
learning
let
him
do
just
as
much
or
as
little
as
ever
he
pleased
he
always
seemed
to
be
on
the
point
of
unbosoming
himself
to
pen
nay
he
confessed
to
the
latter
that
he
had
a
an
attachment
an
ardently
cherished
attachment
about
which
pendennis
longed
to
hear
and
said
tell
us
old
chap
is
she
handsome
has
she
got
blue
eyes
or
black
but
doctor
portman
curate
heaving
a
gentle
sigh
cast
up
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling
and
begged
pen
faintly
to
change
the
conversation
poor
smirke
he
invited
pen
to
dine
at
his
lodgings
over
madame
fribsby
the
milliner
in
clavering
and
once
when
it
was
raining
and
pendennis
who
had
driven
in
her
into
clavering
with
respect
to
some
arrangements
about
leaving
off
mourning
probably
was
prevailed
upon
to
enter
the
apartments
he
sent
out
for
instantly
the
sofa
on
which
she
sate
became
sacred
to
him
from
that
day
and
he
kept
flowers
in
the
glass
which
she
drank
from
ever
after
as
pendennis
was
never
tired
of
hearing
the
praises
of
her
son
we
may
be
certain
that
this
rogue
of
a
tutor
neglected
no
opportunity
of
conversing
with
her
upon
that
subject
it
might
be
a
little
tedious
to
him
to
hear
the
stories
about
pen
generosity
about
his
bravery
in
fighting
the
big
naughty
boy
about
his
fun
and
jokes
about
his
prodigious
skill
in
latin
music
riding
but
what
price
would
he
not
pay
to
be
in
her
company
and
the
widow
after
these
conversations
thought
smirke
a
very
pleasing
and
man
as
for
her
son
she
had
not
settled
in
her
mind
whether
he
was
to
be
senior
wrangler
and
archbishop
of
canterbury
or
double
first
class
at
oxford
and
lord
chancellor
that
all
england
did
not
possess
his
peer
was
a
fact
about
which
there
was
in
her
mind
no
manner
of
question
a
simple
person
of
inexpensive
habits
she
began
forthwith
to
save
and
perhaps
to
be
a
little
parsimonious
in
favour
of
her
boy
there
were
no
entertainments
of
course
at
fairoaks
during
the
year
of
her
weeds
nor
indeed
did
the
doctor
silver
of
which
he
was
so
proud
and
which
were
flourished
all
over
with
the
arms
of
the
pendennises
and
surmounted
with
their
crest
come
out
of
the
again
for
long
long
years
the
household
was
diminished
and
its
expenses
curtailed
there
was
a
very
blank
anchorite
repast
when
pen
dined
from
home
and
he
himself
headed
the
remonstrance
from
the
kitchen
regarding
the
deteriorated
quality
of
the
fairoaks
beer
she
was
becoming
miserly
for
pen
indeed
who
ever
accused
women
of
being
just
they
are
always
sacrificing
themselves
or
somebody
for
somebody
sake
there
happened
to
be
no
young
woman
in
the
small
circle
of
friends
who
were
in
the
widow
intimacy
whom
pendennis
could
by
any
possibility
gratify
by
endowing
her
with
the
inestimable
treasure
of
a
heart
which
he
was
longing
to
give
away
some
young
fellows
in
this
predicament
bestow
their
young
affections
upon
dolly
the
dairymaid
or
cast
the
eyes
of
tenderness
upon
molly
the
blacksmith
daughter
pen
thought
a
pendennis
much
too
grand
a
personage
to
stoop
so
low
he
was
too
for
a
vulgar
intrigue
and
at
the
idea
of
an
intrigue
or
a
seduction
had
he
ever
entertained
it
his
heart
would
have
revolted
as
from
the
notion
of
any
act
of
baseness
or
dishonour
miss

passed
the

yet
with
the
ends
of

tied

he

there

to

after

in

of

and
peep
into
the
and

carriages
as
they
drove
along
the
broad
turnpike
roads
with
a
heart
beating
within
him
and
a
secret
tremor
and
hope
that
she
might
be
in
that
yellow
postchaise
coming
swinging
up
the
hill
or
one
of

three
girls
in
beaver

appeared
to
honest

upon
these
points
he
did
not
discourse
to

he
had
a
world
of
his
own

generous
ardent

soul
has
not

disports

actaeon
was
a
brute
for

leave
him
occasionally
alone
my
good
madam
if
you
have
a
poet
for
a
child
even
your
admirable
advice
may
be
a
bore
sometimes
you
are
faultless
but
it
does
not
follow
that
everybody
in
your
family
is
to
think
exactly
like
yourself
yonder
little
child
may
have
thoughts
too
deep
even
for
your
great
mind
and
fancies
so
coy
and
timid
that
they
will
not
bare
themselves
when
your
ladyship
sits
by
helen
pendennis
by
the
force
of
sheer
love
divined
a
great
number
of
her
son
secrets
but
she
kept
these
things
in
her
heart
if
we
may
so
speak
and
did
not
speak
of
them
besides
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
he
was
to
marry
little
laura
who
would
be
eighteen
when
pen
was
and
had
finished
his
college
career
and
had
made
his
grand
tour
and
was
settled
either
in
london
astonishing
all
the
metropolis
by
his
learning
and
eloquence
at
the
bar
or
better
still
in
a
sweet
country
parsonage
surrounded
with
hollyhocks
and
roses
close
to
a
delightful
romantic
church
from
the
pulpit
of
which
pen
would
utter
the
most
beautiful
sermons
ever
preached
while
these
natural
sentiments
were
waging
war
and
trouble
in
honest
pen
bosom
it
chanced
one
day
that
he
rode
into
chatteris
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
to
the
county
chronicle
a
tremendous
and
thrilling
poem
for
the
next
week
paper
and
putting
up
his
horse
according
to
custom
at
the
stables
of
the
george
hotel
there
he
fell
in
with
an
old
acquaintance
a
grand
black
tandem
with
scarlet
wheels
came
rattling
into
the
inn
yard
as
pen
stood
there
in
converse
with
the
hostler
about
rebecca
and
the
voice
of
the
driver
called
out
hallo
pendennis
is
that
you
in
a
loud
patronising
manner
pen
had
some
difficulty
in
recognising
under
the
hat
and
the
vast
and
neckcloths
with
which
the
was
habited
the
person
and
figure
of
his
quondam
schoolfellow
foker
a
year
absence
had
made
no
small
difference
in
that
gentleman
a
youth
who
had
been
deservedly
whipped
a
few
months
previously
and
who
spent
his
on
tarts
and
hardbake
now
appeared
before
pen
in
one
of
those
costumes
to
which
the
public
consent
that
i
take
to
be
quite
as
influential
in
this
respect
as
dictionary
has
awarded
the
title
of
swell
he
had
a
between
his
legs
and
in
his
scarlet
shawl
neckcloth
was
a
pin
representing
another
in
gold
he
wore
a
fur
waistcoat
laced
over
with
gold
chains
a
green
cutaway
coat
with
and
a
white
ornamented
with
buttons
on
each
of
which
was
engraved
some
stirring
incident
of
the
road
or
the
chase
all
which
ornaments
set
off
this
young
fellow
figure
to
such
advantage
that
you
would
hesitate
to
say
which
character
in
life
he
most
resembled
and
whether
he
was
a
boxer
en
goguette
or
a
coachman
in
his
gala
suit
left
that
place
for
good
pendennis
foker
said
descending
from
his
landau
and
giving
pendennis
a
finger
yes
this
year
or
more
pen
said
beastly
old
hole
foker
remarked

with
an
air
of
the
utmost
consequence
by
gad
sir
i
sometimes
dream
now
that
the
doctor
walking
into
me
foker
continued
and
pen
smiled
as
he
thought
that
he
himself
had
likewise
fearful
dreams
of
this
nature
when
i
think
of
the
diet
there
by
gad
sir
i
wonder
how
i
stood
it
mangy
mutton
brutal
beef
pudding
on
thursdays
and
sundays
and
that
fit
to
poison
you
just
look
at
my
leader
did
you
ever
see
a
prettier
animal
drove
over
from
baymouth
came
the
nine
mile
in
minutes
not
bad
going
are
you
stopping
at
baymouth
foker
pendennis
asked
i
coaching
there
said
the
other
with
a
nod
what
asked
pen
and
in
a
tone
of
such
wonder
that
foker
burst
out
laughing
and
said
he
was
blowed
if
he
did
think
pen
was
such
a
flat
as
not
to
know
what
coaching
i
come
down
with
a
coach
from
oxford
a
tutor
do
you
see
old
boy
he
coaching
me
and
some
other
men
for
the
little
go
me
and
spavin
have
the
drag
between
us
and
i
thought
i
just
tool
over
and
go
to
the
play
did
you
ever
see
rowkins
do
the
hornpipe
and
foker
began
to
perform
some
steps
of
that
popular
dance
in
the
inn
yard
looking
round
for
the
sympathy
of
his
groom
and
the
pen
thought
he
would
like
to
go
to
the
play
too
and
could
ride
home
afterwards
as
there
was
a
moonlight
so
he
accepted
foker
invitation
to
dinner
and
the
young
men
entered
the
inn
together
where
foker
stopped
at
the
bar
and
called
upon
miss
rincer
the
landlady
fair
daughter
who
presided
there
to
give
him
a
glass
of
mixture
pen
and
his
family
had
been
known
at
the
george
ever
since
they
came
into
the
country
and
pendennis
carriages
and
horses
always
put
up
there
when
he
paid
a
visit
to
the
county
town
the
landlady
dropped
the
heir
of
fairoaks
a
very
respectful
curtsey
and
complimented
him
upon
his
growth
and
manly
appearance
and
asked
news
of
the
family
at
fairoaks
and
of
doctor
portman
and
the
clavering
people
to
all
of
which
questions
the
young
gentleman
answered
with
much
affability
but
he
spoke
to
and
rincer
with
that
sort
of
good
nature
with
which
a
young
prince
addresses
his
father
subjects
never
dreaming
that
those
bonnes
gens
were
his
equals
in
life
foker
behaviour
was
quite
different
he
inquired
for
rincer
and
the
cold
in
his
nose
told
rincer
a
riddle
asked
miss
rincer
when
she
would
be
ready
to
marry
him
and
paid
his
compliments
to
miss
brett
the
other
young
lady
in
the
bar
all
in
a
minute
of
time
and
with
a
liveliness
and
facetiousness
which
set
all
these
ladies
in
a
giggle
and
he
gave
a
cluck
expressive
of
great
satisfaction
as
he
tossed
off
his
mixture
which
miss
rincer
prepared
and
handed
to
him
have
a
drop
said
he
to
pen
it
recommended
to
me
by
the
faculty
as
a
a
stomatic
old
boy
give
the
young
one
a
glass
and
score
it
up
to
yours
poor
pen
took
a
glass
and
everybody
laughed
at
the
face
which
he
made
as
he
put
it
down
gin
bitters
and
some
other
cordial
was
the
compound
with
which
foker
was
so
delighted
as
to
call
it
by
the
name
of
foker
own
as
pen
choked
sputtered
and
made
faces
the
other
took
occasion
to
remark
to
rincer
that
the
young
fellow
was
green
very
green
but
that
he
would
soon
form
him
and
then
they
proceeded
to
order
dinner
which
foker
determined
should
consist
of
turtle
and
venison
cautioning
the
landlady
to
be
very
particular
about
icing
the
wine
then
foker
and
pen
strolled
down
the
high
street
together
the
former
having
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
which
he
had
drawn
out
of
a
case
almost
as
big
as
a
portmanteau
he
went
in
to
replenish
it
at
lewis
and
talked
to
that
gentleman
for
a
while
sitting
down
on
the
counter
he
then
looked
in
at
the
fruiterer
to
see
the
pretty
girl
there
to
whom
he
paid
compliments
similar
to
those
before
addressed
to
the
bar
at
the
george
then
they
passed
the
county
chronicle
office
for
which
pen
had
his
packet
ready
in
the
shape
of
to
thyrza
but
poor
pen
did
not
like
to
put
the
letter
into
the
editor
box
while
walking
in
company
with
such
a
fine
gentleman
as
foker
they
met
heavy
dragoons
of
the
regiment
always
quartered
at
chatteris
and
stopped
and
talked
about
the
baymouth
balls
and
what
a
pretty
girl
was
miss
brown
and
what
a
dem
fine
woman
jones
was
it
was
in
vain
that
pen
recalled
to
his
own
mind
what
a
stupid
ass
foker
used
to
be
at
school
how
he
could
scarcely
read
how
he
was
not
cleanly
in
his
person
and
notorious
for
his
blunders
and
dulness
foker
was
no
more
like
a
gentleman
now
than
in
his
school
days
and
yet
pen
felt
a
secret
pride
in
strutting
down
high
street
with
a
young
fellow
who
owned
tandems
talked
to
officers
and
ordered
turtle
and
champagne
for
dinner
he
listened
and
with
respect
too
to
foker
accounts
of
what
the
men
did
at
the
university
of
which
was
an
ornament
and
encountered
a
long
series
of
stories
about
bumping
college
and
and
began
to
wish
to
go
up
himself
to
college
to
a
place
where
there
were
such
manly
pleasures
and
enjoyments
farmer

who
lives
close
by

riding
by
at
this
minute
and
touching
his
hat
to

the
latter
stopped
him
and
sent
a
message
to
his
mother
to
say
that
he
had
met
with
an
old
schoolfellow
and
should
dine
in
chatteris
the
two
young
gentlemen
continued
their
walk
and
were
passing
round
the
cathedral
yard
where
they
could
hear
the
music
of
the
afternoon
service
a
music
which
always
exceedingly
impressed
and
affected
pen
but
whither
foker
came
for
the
purpose
of
inspecting
the
who
frequent
the
elms
walk
there
and
who
are
uncommonly
pretty
at
chatteris
and
here
they
strolled
until
with
a
final
burst
of
music
the
small
congregation
was
played
out
old
doctor
portman
was
one
of
the
few
who
came
from
the
venerable
gate

he
came
and
shook
him
by
the

at

did
not

in

the
cigar
was
an
abomination

the

that

looking
over

as
he
retreated
from

quite
dissatisfied
with
the

fallen

it

declared
to

and

the

has
given
to
that
injured
man
with
a
large
cloak
and

and

hearse
feather
in
it
drooping
over
his
raddled
old
face
and
only
partially
concealing
his
great
buckled
brown
wig
he
had
the
stage
jewellery
on

of
which
he
selected
the
largest
and
most
shiny
rings
for

allowed
his
little
finger
to
quiver
out
of

cloak
with
a
sham
diamond
ring
covering
the
first
joint
of

in

made
it
a
favour
to
the
young
men
of

to
go
on

ring

flattered

for

bingley
fancied
the
world
was
fascinated
with
its
glitter
he
was
reading
out
of
the
that
wonderful
which
is
not
bound
like
any
other
book
in
the
world
but
is
rouged
and
tawdry
like
the
hero
or
heroine
who
holds
it
and
who
holds
it
as
people
never
do
hold
books
and
points
with
his
finger
to
a
passage
and
wags
his
head
ominously
at
the
audience
and
then
lifts
up
eyes
and
finger
to
the
ceiling
professing
to
derive
some
intense
consolation
from
the
work
between
which
and
heaven
there
is
a
strong
affinity
anybody
who
has
ever
seen
one
of
our
great
light
comedians
in
a
chintz
such
as
nobody
ever
wore
and
representing
himself
to
the
public
as
a
young
nobleman
in
his
apartments
and
whiling
away
the
time
with
light
literature
until
his
friend
sir
harry
shall
arrive
or
his
father
shall
come
down
to
breakfast
anybody
i
say
who
has
seen
the
great
over
a
sham
book
has
indeed
had
a
great
pleasure
and
an
abiding
matter
for
thought
directly
the
stranger
saw
the
young
men
he
acted
at
them
eyeing
them
solemnly
over
his
gilt
volume
as
he
lay
on
the
showing
his
hand
his
ring
and
his
hessians
he
calculated
the
effect
that
every
one
of
these
ornaments
would
produce
upon
his
victims
he
was
determined
to
fascinate
them
for
he
knew
they
had
paid
their
money
and
he
saw
their
families
coming
in
from
the
country
and
filling
the
cane
chairs
in
his
boxes
as
he
lay
on
the
bank
reading
his
servant
francis
made
remarks
upon
his
master
again
reading
said
francis
thus
it
is
from
morn
to
night
to
him
nature
has
no
beauty
life
no
charm
for
three
years
i
have
never
seen
him
smile
the
gloom
of
bingley
face
was
fearful
to
witness
during
these
comments
of
the
faithful
domestic
nothing
diverts
him
o
if
he
would
but
attach
himself
to
any
living
thing
were
it
an
animal
for
something
man
must
enter
tobias
goll
from
the
hut
he
cries
o
how
refreshing
after
seven
long
weeks
to
feel
these
warm
sunbeams
once
again
thanks
bounteous
heaven
for
the
joy
i
taste
he
presses
his
cap
between
his
hands
looks
up
and
prays
the
stranger
eyes
him
attentively
francis
to
the
stranger
this
old
man
share
of
earthly
happiness
can
be
but
little
yet
mark
how
grateful
he
is
for
his
portion
of
bingley
because
though
old
he
is
but
a
child
in
the
of
he
looks
steadily
at
foker
who
however
continues
to
suck
the
top
of
his
stick
in
an
unconcerned
manner
francis
hope
is
the
nurse
of
bingley
and
her
cradle
is
the
the
stranger
uttered
this
with
the
moan
of
a
bassoon
in
agony
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
pendennis
so
steadily
that
the
poor
lad
was
quite
put
out
of
countenance
he
thought
the
whole
house
must
be
looking
at
him
and
cast
his
eyes
down
as
soon
as
ever
he
raised
them
bingley
were
at
him
again
all
through
the
scene
the
manager
played
at
him
when
he
was
about
to
do
a
good
action
and
sent
off
francis
with
his
book
so
that
that
domestic
should
not
witness
the
deed
of
benevolence
which
he
meditated
bingley
marked
the
page
carefully
so
that
he
might
continue
the
perusal
of
the
volume
off
the
stage
if
he
liked
but
all
was
done
in
the
direct
face
of
pendennis
whom
the
manager
was
bent
upon
subjugating
how
relieved
the
lad
was
when
the
scene
ended
and
foker
tapping
with
his
cane
cried
out
bravo
bingley
give
him
a
hand
pendennis
you
know
every
chap
likes
a
hand
foker
said
and
the
young
gentleman
and
pendennis
laughing
and
the
dragoons
in
the
opposite
box
began
clapping
hands
to
the
best
of
their
power
a
chamber
in
wintersen
castle
closed
over
tobias
hut
and
the
stranger
and
his
boots
and
servants
appeared
bustling
about
with
chairs
and
tables
that
hicks
and
miss
thackthwaite
whispered
foker
pretty
girl
ai
she
pendennis
but
stop
hurray
bravo
here
the
the
pit
thrilled
and
thumped
its
umbrellas
a
volley
of
applause
was
fired
from
the
gallery
the
dragoon
officers
and
foker
clapped
their
hands
furiously
you
would
have
thought
the
house
was
full
so
loud
were
their
plaudits
the
red
face
and
ragged
whiskers
of
costigan
were
seen
peering
from
the
pen
eyes
opened
wide
and
bright
as
haller
entered
with
a
downcast
look
then
rallying
at
the
sound
of
the
applause
swept
the
house
with
a
grateful
glance
and
folding
her
hands
across
her
breast
sank
down
in
a
magnificent
curtsey
more
applause
more
umbrellas
pen
this
time
flaming
with
wine
and
enthusiasm
clapped
hands
and
sang
bravo
louder
than
all
haller
saw
him
and
everybody
else
and
old
bows
the
little
first
fiddler
of
the
orchestra
which
was
this
night
increased
by
a
detachment
of
the
band
of
the
dragoons
by
the
kind
permission
of
colonel
swallowtail
looked
up
from
the
desk
where
he
was
perched
with
his
crutch
beside
him
and
smiled
at
the
enthusiasm
of
the
lad
those
who
have
only
seen
miss
fotheringay
in
later
days
since
her
marriage
and
introduction
into
london
life
have
little
idea
how
beautiful
a
creature
she
was
at
the
time
when
our
friend
pen
first
set
eyes
on
her
and
i
warn
my
reader
as
beforehand
that
the
pencil
which
illustrates
this
work
and
can
draw
an
ugly
face
tolerably
well
but
is
sadly
put
out
when
it
tries
to
delineate
a
beauty
can
give
no
sort
of
notion
of
her
she
was
of
the
tallest
of
women
and
at
her
then
age
of
for
she
was
though
she
vows
she
was
only
nineteen
in
the
prime
and
fulness
of
her
beauty
her
forehead
was
vast
and
her
black
hair
waved
over
it
with
a
natural
ripple
that
beauties
of
late
days
have
tried
to
imitate
with
the
help
of
the
and
was
confined
in
shining
and
voluminous
braids
at
the
back
of
a
neck
such
as
you
see
on
the
shoulders
of
the
louvre
venus
that
delight
of
gods
and
men
her
eyes
when
she
lifted
them
up
to
gaze
on
you
and
ere
she
dropped
their
purple
lids
shone
with
tenderness
and
mystery
unfathomable
love
and
genius
seemed
to
look
out
from
them
and
then
retire
coyly
as
if
ashamed
to
have
been
seen
at
the
lattice
who
could
have
had
such
a
commanding
brow
but
a
woman
of
high
intellect
she
never
laughed
indeed
her
teeth
were
not
good
but
a
smile
of
endless
tenderness
and
sweetness
played
round
her
beautiful
lips
and
in
the
dimples
of
her
cheeks
and
her
lovely
chin
her
nose
defied
description
in
those
days
her
ears
were
like
two
little
pearl
shells
which
the
earrings
she
wore
though
the
handsomest
properties
in
the
theatre
only
insulted
she
was
dressed
in
long
flowing
robes
of
black
which
she
managed
and
swept
to
and
fro
with
wonderful
grace
and
out
of
the
folds
of
which
you
only
saw
her
sandals
occasionally
they
were
of
rather
a
large
size
but
pen
thought
them
as
ravishing
as
the
slippers
of
cinderella
but
it
was
her
hand
and
arm
that
this
magnificent
creature
most
excelled
in
and
somehow
you
could
never
see
her
but
through
them
they
surrounded
her
when
she
folded
them
over
her
bosom
in
resignation
when
she
dropped
them
in
mute
agony
or
raised
them
in
superb
command
when
in
sportive
gaiety
her
hands
fluttered
and
waved
before
her
like
what
shall
we
say
like
the
snowy
doves
before
the
chariot
of
venus
it
was
with
these
arms
and
hands
that
she
beckoned
repelled
entreated
embraced
her
admirers
no
single
one
for
she
was
armed
with
her
own
virtue
and
with
her
father
valour
whose
sword
would
have
leapt
from
its
scabbard
at
any
insult
offered
to
his
child
but
the
whole
house
which
rose
to
her
as
the
phrase
was
as
she
curtseyed
and
bowed
and
charmed
it
thus
she
stood
for
a
minute
complete
and
beautiful
as
pen
stared
at
her
i
say
pen
is
she
a
stunner
asked
foker
hush
pen
said
she
she
began
her
business
in
a
deep
sweet
voice
those
who
know
the
play
of
the
are
aware
that
the
remarks
made
by
the
various
characters
are
not
valuable
in
themselves
either
for
their
sound
sense
their
novelty
of
observation
or
their
poetic
fancy
in
fact
if
a
man
were
to
say
it
was
a
stupid
play
he
would
not
be
far
wrong
nobody
ever
talked
so
if
we
meet
idiots
in
life
as
will
happen
it
is
a
great
mercy
that
they
do
not
use
such
absurdly
fine
words
the
stranger
talk
is
sham
like
the
book
he
reads
and
the
hair
he
wears
and
the
bank
he
sits
on
and
the
diamond
ring
he
makes
play
with
but
in
the
midst
of
the
balderdash
there
runs
that
reality
of
love
children
and
forgiveness
of
wrong
which
will
be
listened
to
wherever
it
is
preached
and
sets
all
the
world
sympathising
with
what
smothered
sorrow
with
what
gushing
pathos
haller
delivered
her
part
at
first
when
as
count
wintersen
housekeeper
and
preparing
for
his
excellency
arrival
she
has
to
give
orders
about
the
beds
and
furniture
and
the
dinner
to
be
got
ready
she
did
so
with
the
calm
agony
of
despair
but
when
she
could
get
rid
of
the
stupid
servants
and
give
vent
to
her
feelings
to
the
pit
and
the
house
she
overflowed
to
each
individual
as
if
he
were
her
particular
confidant
and
she
was
crying
out
her
griefs
on
his
shoulder
the
little
fiddler
in
the
orchestra
whom
she
did
not
seem
to
watch
though
he
followed
her
ceaselessly
twitched
twisted
nodded
pointed
about
and
when
she
came
to
the
favourite
passage
i
have
a
william
too
if
he
be
still
alive
ah
yes
if
he
be
still
alive
his
little
sisters
too
why
fancy
dost
thou
rack
me
so
why
dost
thou
image
my
poor
children
fainting
in
sickness
and
crying
to
to
their
mum
um
other
when
she
came
to
this
passage
little
bows
buried
his
face
in
his
blue
cotton
handkerchief
after
crying
out
all
the
house
was
affected
foker
for
his
part
taking
out
a
large
yellow
bandanna
wept
piteously
as
for
pen
he
was
gone
too
far
for
that
he
followed
the
woman
about
and
about
when
she
was
off
the
stage
it
and
the
house
were
blank
the
lights
and
the
red
officers
reeled
wildly
before
his
sight
he
watched
her
at
the
where
she
stood
waiting
to
come
on
the
stage
and
where
her
father
took
off
her
shawl
when
the
reconciliation
arrived
and
she
flung
herself
down
on
bingley
shoulders
whilst
the
children
clung
to
their
knees
and
the
countess
bingley
and
baron
steinforth
performed
with
great
liveliness
and
spirit
by
garbetts
while
the
rest
of
the
characters
formed
a
group
round
them
pen
hot
eyes
only
saw
fotheringay
fotheringay
the
curtain
fell
upon
him
like
a
pall
he
did
not
hear
a
word
of
what
bingley
said
who
came
forward
to
announce
the
play
for
the
next
evening
and
who
took
the
tumultuous
applause
as
usual
for
himself
pen
was
not
even
distinctly
aware
that
the
house
was
calling
for
miss
fotheringay
nor
did
the
manager
seem
to
comprehend
that
anybody
else
but
himself
had
caused
the
success
of
the
play
at
last
he
understood
it
stepped
back
with
a
grin
and
presently
appeared
with
haller
on
his
arm
how
beautiful
she
looked
her
hair
had
fallen
down
the
officers
threw
her
flowers
she
clutched
them
to
her
heart
she
put
back
her
hair
and
smiled
all
round
her
eyes
met
pen
down
went
the
curtain
again
and
she
was
gone
not
one
note
could
he
hear
of
the
overture
which
the
brass
band
of
the
dragoons
blew
by
kind
permission
of
colonel
swallowtail
she
is
a
crusher
ai
she
now
foker
asked
of
his
companion
pen
did
not
know
exactly
what
foker
said
and
answered
vaguely
he
could
not
tell
the
other
what
he
felt
he
could
not
have
spoken
just
then
to
any
mortal
besides
pendennis
did
not
quite
know
what
he
felt
yet
it
was
something
overwhelming
maddening
delicious
a
fever
of
wild
joy
and
undefined
longing
and
now
rowkins
and
miss
thackthwaite
came
on
to
dance
the
favourite
double
hornpipe
and
foker
abandoned
himself
to
the
delights
of
this
ballet
just
as
he
had
to
the
tears
of
the
tragedy
a
few
minutes
before
pen
did
not
care
for
it
or
indeed
think
about
the
dance
except
to
remember
that
that
woman
was
acting
with
her
in
the
scene
where
she
first
came
in
it
was
a
mist
before
his
eyes
at
the
end
of
the
dance
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
said
it
was
time
for
him
to
go
hang
it
stay
to
see
the
bravo
of
the
foker
said
bingley
splendid
in
it
he
wears
red
tights
and
has
to
carry
over
the
of
the
cataract
only
she
too
heavy
it
great
fun
do
pen
looked
at
the
bill
with
one
lingering
fond
hope
that
miss
fotheringay
name
might
be
hidden
somewhere
in
the
list
of
the
actors
of
the
but
there
was
no
such
name
go
he
must
he
had
a
long
ride
home
he
squeezed
foker
hand
he
was
choking
to
speak
but
he
could
he
quitted
the
theatre
and
walked
frantically
about
the
town
he
knew
not
how
long
then
he
mounted
at
the
george
and
rode
homewards
and
clavering
clock
sang
out
one
as
he
came
into
the
yard
at
fairoaks
the
lady
of
the
house
might
have
been
awake
but
she
only
heard
him
from
the
passage
outside
his
room
as
he
dashed
into
bed
and
pulled
the
clothes
over
his
head
pen
had
not
been
in
the
habit
of
passing
wakeful
nights
so
he
at
once
fell
off
into
a
sound
sleep
even
in
later
days
and
with
a
great
deal
of
care
and
other
thoughtful
matter
to
keep
him
awake
a
man
from
long
practice
or
fatigue
or
resolution
begins
by
going
to
sleep
as
usual
and
gets
a
nap
in
advance
of
anxiety
but
she
soon
comes
up
with
him
and
jogs
his
shoulder
and
says
come
my
man
no
more
of
this
laziness
you
must
wake
up
and
have
a
talk
with
then
they
fall
to
together
in
the
midnight
well
whatever
might
afterwards
happen
to
him
poor
little
pen
was
not
come
to
this
state
yet
he
tumbled
into
a
sound
sleep
did
not
wake
until
an
early
hour
in
the
morning
when
the
rooks
began
to
caw
from
the
little
wood
beyond
his
bedroom
windows
and
at
that
very
instant
and
as
his
eyes
started
open
the
beloved
image
was
in
his
mind
my
dear
boy
he
heard
her
say
you
were
in
a
sound
sleep
and
i
would
not
disturb
you
but
i
have
been
close
by
your
pillow
all
this
while
and
i
do
intend
that
you
shall
leave
me
i
am
love
i
bring
with
me
fever
and
passion
wild
longing
maddening
desire
restless
craving
and
seeking
many
a
long
day
ere
this
i
heard
you
calling
out
for
me
and
behold
now
i
am
was
pen
frightened
at
the
summons
not
he
he
did
not
know
what
was
coming
it
was
all
wild
pleasure
and
delight
as
yet
and
as
when
three
years
previously
and
on
entering
the
fifth
form
at
the
cistercians
his
father
had
made
him
a
present
of
a
gold
watch
which
the
boy
took
from
under
his
pillow
and
examined
on
the
instant
of
waking
for
ever
rubbing
and
polishing
it
up
in
private
and
retiring
into
corners
to
listen
to
its
ticking
so
the
young
man
exulted
over
his
new
delight
felt
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
to
see
that
it
was
safe
wound
it
up
at
nights
and
at
the
very
first
moment
of
waking
hugged
it
and
looked
at
by
the
way
that
first
watch
of
pen
was
a
showy
piece
it
never
went
well
from
the
beginning
and
was
always
getting
out
of
order
and
after
putting
it
aside
into
a
drawer
and
forgetting
it
for
some
time
he
swapped
it
finally
away
for
a
more
useful
pen
felt
himself
to
be
ever
so
many
years
older
since
yesterday
there
was
no
mistake
about
it
now
he
was
as
much
in
love
as
the
best
hero
in
the
best
romance
he
ever
read
he
told
john
to
bring
his
shaving
water
with
the
utmost
confidence
he
dressed
himself
in
some
of
his
finest
clothes
that
morning
and
came
splendidly
down
to
breakfast
patronising
his
mother
and
little
laura
who
had
been
strumming
her
music
lesson
for
hours
before
and
who
after
he
had
read
the
prayers
of
which
he
did
not
heed
one
single
syllable
wondered
at
his
grand
appearance
and
asked
him
to
tell
her
what
the
play
was
about
pen
laughed
and
declined
to
tell
laura
what
the
play
was
about
in
fact
it
was
quite
as
well
that
she
should
not
know
then
she
asked
him
why
he
had
got
on
his
fine
pin
and
beautiful
new
waistcoat
pen
blushed
and
told
his
mother
that
the
old
schoolfellow
with
whom
he
had
dined
at
chatteris
was
reading
with
a
tutor
at
baymouth
a
very
learned
man
and
as
he
was
himself
to
go
to
college
and
as
there
were
several
young
men
pursuing
their
studies
at
baymouth
he
was
anxious
to
ride
over
and
and
just
see
what
the
course
of
their
reading
was
laura
made
a
long
face
helen
pendennis
looked
hard
at
her
son
troubled
more
than
ever
with
the
vague
doubt
and
terror
which
had
been
haunting
her
ever
since
the
last
night
when
farmer
gurnett
brought
back
the
news
that
pen
would
not
return
home
to
dinner
arthur
eyes
defied
her
she
tried
to
console
herself
and
drive
off
her
fears
the
boy
had
never
told
her
an
untruth
pen
conducted
himself
during
breakfast
in
a
very
haughty
and
supercilious
manner
and
taking
leave
of
the
elder
and
younger
lady
was
presently
heard
riding
out
of
the
stablecourt
he
went
gently
at
first
but
galloped
like
a
madman
as
soon
as
he
thought
that
he
was
out
of
hearing
smirke
thinking
of
his
own
affairs
and
softly
riding
with
his
toes
out
to
give
pen
his
three
hours
reading
at
fairoaks
met
his
pupil
who
shot
by
him
like
the
wind
smirke
pony
shied
as
the
other
thundered
past
him
the
gentle
curate
went
over
his
head
among
the
in
the
hedge
pen
laughed
as
they
met
pointed
towards
the
baymouth
road
and
was
gone
half
a
mile
in
that
direction
before
poor
smirke
had
picked
himself
up
pen
had
resolved
in
his
mind
that
he
must
see
foker
that
morning
he
must
hear
about
her
know
about
her
be
with
somebody
who
knew
her
and
honest
smirke
for
his
part
sitting
up
among
the
as
his
pony
cropped
quietly
in
the
hedge
thought
dismally
to
himself
ought
he
to
go
to
fairoaks
now
that
his
pupil
was
evidently
gone
away
for
the
day
yes
he
thought
he
might
go
too
he
might
go
and
ask
pendennis
when
arthur
would
be
back
and
hear
miss
laura
her
catechism
he
got
up
on
the
little
pony
both
were
used
to
his
slipping
off
and
advanced
upon
the
house
from
which
his
scholar
had
just
rushed
away
in
a
whirlwind
thus
love
makes
fools
of
all
of
us
big
and
little
and
the
curate
had
tumbled
over
head
and
heels
in
pursuit
of
it
and
pen
had
started
in
the
first
heat
of
the
mad
race
chapter
haller
at
home
without
slackening
her
pace
rebecca
the
mare
galloped
on
to
baymouth
where
pen
put
her
up
at
the
inn
stables
and
ran
straightway
to
foker
lodgings
which
he
knew
from
the
direction
given
to
him
by
that
gentleman
on
the
previous
day
on
reaching
these
apartments
which
were
over
a
chemist
shop
whose
stock
of
cigars
and
sodawater
went
off
rapidly
by
the
kind
patronage
of
his
young
inmates
pen
only
found
spavin
foker
friend
and
part
owner
of
the
tandem
which
the
latter
had
driven
into
chatteris
who
was
smoking
and
teaching
a
little
dog
a
friend
of
his
tricks
with
a
bit
of
biscuit
pen
healthy
red
face
fresh
from
the
gallop
compared
oddly
with
the
waxy
debauched
little
features
of
foker
chum
the
latter
remarked
it
who
that
man
he
thought
he
looks
as
fresh
as
a
bean
his
hand
do
shake
of
a
morning
i
bet
five
to
foker
had
not
come
home
at
all
here
was
a
disappointment
mr
spavin
could
not
say
when
his
friend
would
return
sometimes
he
stopped
a
day
sometimes
a
week
of
what
college
was
pen
would
he
have
anything
there
was
a
very
fair
tap
of
ale
spavin
was
enabled
to
know
name
on
the
card
which
the
latter
took
out
and
laid
down
perhaps
pen
in
these
days
was
rather
proud
of
having
a
card
and
so
the
young
men
took
leave
then
pen
went
down
the
rock
and
walked
about
on
the
sand
biting
his
nails
by
the
shore
of
the
sea
it
stretched
before
him
bright
and
immeasurable
the
blue
waters
came
rolling
into
the
bay
foaming
and
roaring
hoarsely
pen
looked
them
in
the
face
with
blank
eyes
hardly
regarding
them
what
a
tide
there
was
pouring
into
the
lad
own
mind
at
the
time
and
what
a
little
power
had
he
to
check
it
pen
flung
stones
into
the
sea
but
it
still
kept
coming
on
he
was
in
a
rage
at
not
seeing
foker
he
wanted
to
see
foker
he
must
see
foker
suppose
i
go
on
on
the
chatteris
road
just
to
see
if
i
can
meet
him
pen
thought
rebecca
was
saddled
in
another
half
hour
and
galloping
on
the
grass
by
the
chatteris
road
about
four
miles
from
baymouth
the
clavering
road
branches
off
as
everybody
knows
and
the
mare
naturally
was
for
taking
that
turn
but
cutting
her
over
the
shoulder
pen
passed
the
turning
and
rode
on
to
the
turnpike
without
seeing
any
sign
of
the
black
tandem
and
red
wheels
as
he
was
at
the
turnpike
he
might
as
well
go
on
that
was
quite
clear
so
pen
rode
to
the
george
and
the
hostler
told
him
that
foker
was
there
sure
enough
and
that
he
been
a
makin
a
tremendous
row
the
night
afore
a
drinkin
and
a
singin
and
wanting
to
fight
tom
the
postboy
which
i
thinking
he
have
had
the
worst
of
it
the
man
added
with
a
grin

you
carried
up
your
master
water
to
shave
with
he
added
in
a
very
satirical
manner
to
domestic
who
here
came
down
the
yard
bearing
his
master
clothes
most
beautifully
brushed
and
arranged
show
pendennis
up
to
and
pen
followed
the
man
at
last
to
the
apartment
where
in
the
midst
of
an
immense
bed
harry
foker
lay
reposing
the
feather
bed
and
bolsters
swelled
up
all
round
foker
so
that
you
could
hardly
see
his
little
sallow
face
and
red
silk
nightcap

said

out

chanted
and
i
remember
i
wanted
to
fight
a
postboy
did
i
thrash
him
stoopid
no
sir
fight
did
come
off
sir
said
stoopid
still
with
perfect
gravity
he
was
arranging
foker
a
trunk
the
gift
of
a
fond
mother
without
which
the
young
fellow
never
travelled
it
contained
a
prodigious
apparatus
in
plate
a
silver
dish
a
silver
mug
silver
boxes
and
bottles
for
all
sorts
of
essences
and
a
choice
of
razors
ready
against
the
time
when
foker
beard
should
come
do
it
some
other
day
said
the
young
fellow
yawning
and
throwing
up
his
little
lean
arms
over
his
head
no
there
was
no
fight
but
there
was
chanting
bingley
chanted
i
chanted
the
general
chanted
costigan
i
did
you
ever
hear
him
sing
little
pig
under
the
bed
pen
the
man
we
met
yesterday
said
pen
all
in
a
tremor
the
father
of
of
the
fotheringay
the
very
man
ai
she
a
venus
pen
please
sir
costigan
in
the
sir
and
says
sir
you
asked
him
to
breakfast
sir
called
five
times
sir
but
would
wake
you
on
no
account
and
has
been
here
since
eleven
sir
how
much
is
it
now
one
what
would
the
best
of
mothers
say
cried
the
little
sluggard
if
she
saw
me
in
bed
at
this
hour
she
sent
me
down
here
with
a
grinder
she
wants
me
to
cultivate
my
neglected
genus
he
be
i
say
pen
this
quite
like
seven
school
is
it
old
boy
and
the
young
fellow
burst
out
into
a
boyish
laugh
of
enjoyment
then
he
added
go
in
and
talk
to
the
general
whilst
i
dress
and
i
say
pendennis
ask
him
to
sing
you
little
pig
under
the
bed
it
pen
went
off
in
great
perturbation
to
meet
costigan
and
foker
commenced
his
toilet
of
foker
two
grandfathers
the
one
from
whom
he
inherited
a
fortune
was
a
brewer
the
other
was
an
earl
who
endowed
him
with
the
most
doting
mother
in
the
world
the
fokers
had
been
at
the
cistercian
school
from
father
to
son
at
which
place
our
friend
whose
name
could
be
seen
over
the
playground
wall
on
a
sign
under
which
entire
was
painted
had
been
dreadfully
bullied
on
account
of
his
trade
his
uncomely
countenance
his
inaptitude
for
learning
and
cleanliness
his
gluttony
and
other
weak
points
but
those
who
know
how
a
susceptible
youth
under
the
tyranny
of
his
schoolfellows
becomes
silent
and
a
sneak
may
understand
how
in
a
very
few
months
after
his
liberation
from
bondage
he
developed
himself
as
he
had
done
and
became
the
humorous
the
sarcastic
the
brilliant
foker
with
whom
we
have
made
acquaintance
a
dunce
he
always
was
it
is
true
for
learning
can
not
be
acquired
by
leaving
school
and
entering
at
college
as
a
but
he
was
now
in
his
own
peculiar
manner
as
great
a
dandy
as
he
before
had
been
a
slattern
and
when
he
entered
his
to
join
his
two
guests
arrived
scented
and
arrayed
in
fine
linen
and
perfectly
splendid
in
appearance
general
or
captain
costigan
for
the
latter
was
the
rank
which
he
preferred
to
assume
was
seated
in
the
window
with
the
newspaper
held
before
him
at
arm
length
the
captain
eyes
were
somewhat
dim
and
he
was
spelling
the
paper
with
the
help
of
his
lips
as
well
as
of
those
bloodshot
eyes
of
his
as
you
see
gentlemen
do
to
whom
reading
is
a
rare
and
difficult
occupation
his
hat
was
cocked
very
much
on
one
ear
and
as
one
of
his
feet
lay
up
in
the
the
observer
of
such
matters
might
remark
by
the
size
and
shabbiness
of
the
boots
which
the
captain
wore
that
times
did
not
go
very
well
with
him
poverty
seems
as
if
it
were
disposed
before
it
takes
possession
of
a
man
entirely
to
attack
his
extremities
first
the
coverings
of
his
head
feet
and
hands
are
its
first
prey
all
these
parts
of
the
captain
person
were
particularly
rakish
and
shabby
as
soon
as
he
saw
pen
he
descended
from
the
and
saluted
the
first
in
a
military
manner
by
conveying
a
couple
of
his
fingers
covered
with
a
broken
black
glove
to
his
hat
and
then
removing
that
ornament
altogether
the
captain
was
inclined
to
be
bald
but
he
brought
a
quantity
of
lank
hair
over
his
pate
and
had
a
couple
of
whisps
of
the
same
falling
down
on
each
side
of
his
face
much
whisky
had
spoiled
what
complexion
costigan
may
have
possessed
in
his
youth
his
once
handsome
face
had
now
a
copper
tinge
he
wore
a
very
high
stock
scarred
and
stained
in
many
places
and
a
tightly
buttoned
up
in
those
parts
where
the
buttons
had
not
parted
company
from
the
garment
the
young
gentleman
to
whom
i
had
the
honour
to
be
introjuiced
yesterday
in
the
cathadral
yard
said
the
captain
with
a
splendid
bow
and
wave
of
his
hat
i
hope
i
see
you
well
sir
i
marked
ye
in
the
thayatre
last
night
during
me
daughter
perfawrumance
and
missed
ye
on
my
return
i
did
but
conduct
her
home
sir
for
jack
costigan
though
poor
is
a
gentleman
and
when
i
reintered
the
house
to
pay
me
respects
to
me
joyous
young
friend
foker
ye
were
gone
we
had
a
jolly
night
of
ut
sir
foker
the
three
gallant
young
dragoons
and
your
servant
gad
sir
it
put
me
in
mind
of
one
of
our
old
nights
when
i
bore
his
majesty
commission
in
the
foighting
hundtherd
and
and
he
pulled
out
an
old
snuff
box
which
he
presented
with
a
stately
air
to
his
new
acquaintance
arthur
was
a
great
deal
too
much
flurried
to
speak
this
buck
was
was
her
father
the
captain
was
perfumed
with
the
recollections
of
the
last
night
cigars
and
pulled
and
twisted
the
tuft
on
his
chin
as
jauntily
as
any
young
dandy
i
hope
miss
f
miss
costigan
is
well
sir
pen
said
flushing
up
she
she
gave
me
greater
pleasure
than
than
i
i
i
ever
enjoyed
at
a
play
i
think
sir
i
think
she
the
finest
actress
in
the
world
he
gasped
out
your
hand
young
man
for
ye
speak
from
your
heart
cried
the
captain
thank
ye
sir
an
old
soldier
and
a
fond
father
thanks
ye
she
is
the
finest
actress
in
the
world
i
seen
the
siddons
sir
and
the
they
were
great
but
what
were
they
compared
to
miss
fotheringay
i
do
not
wish
she
should
ashume
her
own
name
while
on
the
stage
me
family
sir
are
proud
people
and
the
costigans
of
costiganstown
think
that
an
honest
man
who
has
borne
her
colours
in
the
hundred
and
third
would
demean
himself
by
permitting
his
daughter
to
earn
her
old
father
there
can
not
be
a
more
honourable
duty
surely
pen
said
honourable
bedad
sir
i
like
to
see
the
man
who
said
jack
costigan
would
consent
to
anything
dishonourable
i
have
a
heart
sir
though
i
am
poor
i
like
a
man
who
has
a
heart
you
have
i
read
it
in
your
honest
face
and
steady
eye
and
would
you
believe
it
he
added
after
a
pause
and
with
a
pathetic
whisper
that
that
bingley
who
has
made
his
fortune
by
me
child
gives
her
but
two
guineas
a
week
out
of
which
she
finds
herself
in
dresses
and
which
added
to
me
own
small
means
makes
our
all
now
the
captain
means
were
so
small
as
to
be
it
may
be
said
quite
invisible
but
nobody
knows
how
the
wind
is
tempered
to
shorn
irish
lambs
and
in
what
marvellous
places
they
find
pasture
if
captain
costigan
whom
i
had
the
honour
to
know
would
but
have
told
his
history
it
would
have
been
a
great
moral
story
but
he
neither
would
have
told
it
if
he
could
nor
could
if
he
would
for
the
captain
was
not
only
unaccustomed
to
tell
the
truth
he
was
unable
even
to
think
it
and
fact
and
fiction
reeled
together
in
his
muzzy
whiskified
brain
he
began
life
rather
brilliantly
with
a
pair
of
colours
a
fine
person
and
legs
and
one
of
the
most
beautiful
voices
in
the
world
to
his
latest
day
he
sang
with
admirable
pathos
and
humour
those
wonderful
irish
ballads
which
are
so
mirthful
and
so
melancholy
and
was
always
the
first
himself
to
cry
at
their
pathos
poor
cos
he
was
at
once
brave
and
maudlin
humorous
and
an
idiot
always
and
sometimes
almost
trustworthy
up
to
the
last
day
of
his
life
he
would
drink
with
any
man
and
back
any
man
bill
and
his
end
was
in
a
where
the
sheriff
officer
who
took
him
was
fond
of
him
in
his
brief
morning
of
life
cos
formed
the
delight
of
regimental
messes
and
had
the
honour
of
singing
his
songs
bacchanalian
and
sentimental
at
the
tables
of
the
most
illustrious
generals
and
in
the
course
of
which
period
he
drank
three
times
as
much
claret
as
was
good
for
him
and
spent
his
doubtful
patrimony
what
became
of
him
subsequently
to
his
retirement
from
the
army
is
no
affair
of
ours
i
take
it
no
foreigner
understands
the
life
of
an
irish
gentleman
without
money
the
way
in
which
he
manages
to
keep
afloat
the
conspiracies
in
which
he
engages
with
heroes
as
unfortunate
as
himself
the
means
by
which
he
contrives
during
most
days
of
the
week
to
get
his
portion
of
all
these
are
mysteries
to
us
inconceivable
but
suffice
it
to
say
that
through
all
the
storms
of
life
jack
had
floated
somehow
and
the
lamp
of
his
nose
had
never
gone
out
before
he
and
pen
had
had
a
conversation
the
captain
managed
to
extract
a
couple
of
sovereigns
from
the
young
gentleman
for
tickets
for
his
daughter
benefit
which
was
to
take
place
speedily
and
was
not
a
bona
fide
transaction
such
as
that
of
the
last
year
when
poor
miss
fotheringay
had
lost
fifteen
shillings
by
her
venture
but
was
an
arrangement
with
the
manager
by
which
the
lady
was
to
have
the
sale
of
a
certain
number
of
tickets
keeping
for
herself
a
large
portion
of
the
sum
for
which
they
were
sold
pen
had
but
two
pounds
in
his
purse
and
he
handed
them
over
to
the
captain
for
the
tickets
he
would
have
been
afraid
to
offer
more
lest
he
should
offend
the
latter
delicacy
costigan
scrawled
him
an
order
for
a
box
lightly
slipped
the
sovereigns
into
his
waistcoat
and
slapped
his
hand
over
the
place
where
they
lay
they
seemed
to
warm
his
old
sides
faith
sir
said
he
the
bullion
scarcer
with
me
than
it
used
to
be
as
is
the
case
with
many
a
good
fellow
i
won
six
hundthred
of
in
a
single
night
sir
when
me
kind
friend
his
royal
highness
the
duke
of
kent
was
in
and
he
straightway
poured
out
to
pen
a
series
of
stories
regarding
the
claret
drunk
the
bets
made
the
races
ridden
by
the
garrison
there
with
which
he
kept
the
young
gentleman
amused
until
the
arrival
of
their
host
and
his
breakfast
then
it
was
good
to
see
the
captain
behaviour
before
the
devilled
turkey
and
the
mutton
chops
his
stories
poured
forth
unceasingly
and
his
spirits
rose
as
he
chatted
to
the
young
men
when
he
got
a
bit
of
sunshine
the
old
lazzarone
basked
in
it
he
prated
about
his
own
affairs
and
past
splendour
and
all
the
lords
generals
and
he
had
ever
known
he
described
the
death
of
his
darling
bessie
the
late
costigan
and
the
challenge
he
had
sent
to
captain
shanty
clancy
of
the
slashers
for
looking
rude
at
miss
fotheringay
as
she
was
on
her
kyar
in
the
phaynix
and
then
he
described
how
the
captain
apologised
gave
a
dinner
at
the
kildare
street
where
six
of
them
drank
bottles
of
claret
etc
he
announced
that
to
sit
with
two
such
noble
and
generous
young
fellows
was
the
happiness
and
pride
of
an
old
soldier
existence
and
having
had
a
second
glass
of
curacoa
was
so
happy
that
he
began
to
cry
altogether
we
should
say
that
the
captain
was
not
a
man
of
much
strength
of
mind
or
a
very
eligible
companion
for
youth
but
there
are
worse
men
holding
much
better
places
in
life
and
more
dishonest
who
have
never
committed
half
so
many
rogueries
as
he
they
walked
out
the
captain
holding
an
arm
of
each
of
his
dear
young
friends
and
in
a
maudlin
state
of
contentment
he
winked
at
one
or
two
tradesmen
shops
where
possibly
he
owed
a
bill
as
much
as
to
say
see
the
company
i
in
sure
i
pay
you
my
boy
and
they
parted
finally
with
foker
at
a
where
the
latter
had
a
particular
engagement
with
some
gentlemen
of
colonel
swallowtail
regiment
pen
and
the
shabby
captain
still
walked
the
street
together
the
captain
in
his
sly
way
making
inquiries
about
foker
fortune
and
station
in
life
pen
told
him
how
foker
father
was
a
celebrated
brewer
and
his
mother
was
lady
agnes
milton
lord
daughter
the
captain
broke
out
into
a
strain
of
exaggerated
compliment
and
panegyric
about
foker
whose
native
aristocracie
he
said
could
be
seen
with
the
twinkling
of
an
oi
and
only
served
to
adawrun
other
qualities
which
he
possessed
a
foin
intellect
and
a
generous
heart
in
not
one
word
of
which
speech
did
the
captain
accurately
believe
pen
walked
on
listening
to
his
companion
prate
wondering
amused
and
puzzled
it
had
not
as
yet
entered
into
the
boy
head
to
disbelieve
any
statement
that
was
made
to
him
and
being
of
a
candid
nature
himself
he
took
naturally
for
truth
what
other
people
told
him
costigan
had
never
had
a
better
listener
and
was
highly
flattered
by
the
attentiveness
and
modest
bearing
of
the
young
man
so
much
pleased
was
he
with
the
young
gentleman
so
artless
honest
and
cheerful
did
pen
seem
to
be
that
the
captain
finally
made
him
an
invitation
which
he
very
seldom
accorded
to
young
men
and
asked
pen
if
he
would
do
him
the
fever
to
enter
his
humble
abode
which
was
near
at
hand
where
the
captain
would
have
the
honour
of
inthrojuicing
his
young
friend
to
his
daughther
miss
fotheringay
pen
was
so
delightfully
shocked
at
this
invitation
and
was
so
stricken
down
by
the
happiness
thus
suddenly
offered
to
him
that
he
thought
he
should
have
dropped
from
the
captain
arm
at
first
and
trembled
lest
the
other
should
discover
his
emotion
he
gasped
out
a
few
incoherent
words
indicative
of
the
high
gratification
he
should
have
in
being
presented
to
the
lady
for
whose
for
whose
talents
he
had
conceived
such
an
admiration
such
an
extreme
admiration
and
followed
the
captain
scarcely
knowing
whither
that
gentleman
led
him
he
was
going
to
see
her
he
was
going
to
see
her
in
her
was
the
centre
of
the
universe
she
was
the
kernel
of
the
world
for
pen
yesterday
before
he
knew
her
seemed
a
period
ever
so
long
ago
a
revolution
was
between
him
and
that
time
and
a
new
world
about
to
begin
the
captain
conducted
his
young
friend
to
that
quiet
little
street
in
chatteris
which
is
called
prior
lane
which
lies
in
the
ecclesiastical
quarter
of
the
town
close
by
dean
green
and
the
canons
houses
and
is
overlooked
by
the
enormous
towers
of
the
cathedral
there
the
captain
dwelt
modestly
in
the
first
floor
of
a
low
gabled
house
on
the
door
of
which
was
the
brass
plate
of
tailor
and
creed
was
dead
however
his
widow
was
a
in
the
cathedral
hard
by
his
eldest
son
was
a
little
scamp
of
a
who
played
led
his
little
brothers
into
mischief
and
had
a
voice
as
sweet
as
an
angel
a
couple
of
the
latter
were
sitting
on
the
down
which
you
went
into
the
passage
of
the
house
and
they
jumped
up
with
great
alacrity
to
meet
their
lodger
and
plunged
wildly
and
rather
to
pen
surprise
at
the
of
the
captain
for
the
truth
is
that
the
gentleman
when
he
was
in
cash
generally
brought
home
an
apple
or
a
piece
of
gingerbread
for
these
children
whereby
the
widdy
never
pressed
me
for
rint
when
not
convanient
as
he
remarked
afterwards
to
pen
winking
knowingly
and
laying
a
finger
on
his
nose
pen
tumbled
down
the
step
and
as
he
followed
his
companion
up
the
creaking
old
stair
his
knees
trembled
under
him
he
could
hardly
see
when
he
entered
following
the
captain
and
stood
in
the
room
in
her
room
he
saw
something
black
before
him
and
waving
as
if
making
a
curtsey
and
heard
but
quite
indistinctly
costigan
making
a
speech
over
him
in
which
the
captain
with
his
usual
magniloquence
expressed
to
me
child
his
wish
to
make
her
known
to
his
dear
and
admirable
young
friend
awther
pindinnis
a
young
gentleman
of
property
in
the
neighbourhood
a
person
of
refoined
moind
and
enviable
manners
a
sincare
lover
of
poethry
and
a
man
possest
of
a
feeling
and
affectionate
it
is
very
fine
weather
miss
fotheringay
said
in
an
irish
accent
and
with
a
deep
rich
melancholy
voice
very
said
pendennis
in
this
romantic
way
their
conversation
began
and
he
found
himself
seated
on
a
chair
and
having
leisure
to
look
at
the
young
lady
she
looked
still
handsomer
off
the
stage
than
before
the
lamps
all
her
attitudes
were
naturally
grand
and
majestical
if
she
went
and
stood
up
against
the
mantelpiece
her
robe
draped
itself
classically
round
her
her
chin
supported
itself
on
her
hand
the
other
lines
of
her
form
arranged
themselves
in
full
harmonious
undulations
she
looked
like
a
muse
in
contemplation
if
she
sate
down
on
a
chair
her
arm
rounded
itself
over
the
back
of
the
seat
her
hand
seemed
as
if
it
ought
to
have
a
sceptre
put
into
it
the
folds
of
her
dress
fell
naturally
round
her
in
order
like
ladies
of
honour
round
a
throne
and
she
looked
like
an
empress
all
her
movements
were
graceful
and
imperial
in
the
morning
you
could
see
her
hair
was
her
complexion
of
dazzling
fairness
with
the
faintest
possible
blush
flickering
as
it
were
in
her
cheek
her
eyes
were
grey
with
prodigious
long
lashes
and
as
for
her
mouth
pendennis
has
given
me
subsequently
to
understand
that
it
was
of
a
staring
red
colour
with
which
the
most
brilliant
geranium
or
guardsman
coat
could
not
vie
and
very
warm
continued
this
empress
and
queen
of
sheba
mr
pen
again
assented
and
the
conversation
rolled
on
in
this
manner
she
asked
costigan
whether
he
had
had
a
pleasant
evening
at
the
george
and
he
recounted
the
supper
and
the
tumblers
of
punch
then
the
father
asked
her
how
she
had
been
employing
the
morning
bows
came
said
she
at
ten
and
we
studied
ophalia
it
for
the
when
i
hope
sir
we
shall
have
the
honour
of
seeing
indeed
indeed
you
will
pendennis
cried
wondering
that
she
should
say
and
speak
with
an
irish
inflection
of
voice
naturally
who
had
not
the
least
hibernian
accent
on
the
stage
i
secured
for
your
benefit
dear
said
the
captain
tapping
his
waistcoat
pocket
wherein
lay
pen
sovereigns
and
winking
at
pen
with
one
eye
at
which
the
boy
blushed
mr
gentleman
very
obleging
said
haller
my
name
is
pendennis
said
pen
blushing
i
i
hope
you
remember
his
heart
thumped
so
as
he
made
this
audacious
declaration
that
he
almost
choked
in
uttering
it
pendennis
she
answered
slowly
and
looking
him
full
in
the
eyes
with
a
glance
so
straight
so
clear
so
bright
so
killing
with
a
voice
so
sweet
so
round
so
low
that
the
word
and
the
glance
shot
pen
through
and
through
and
perfectly
transfixed
him
with
pleasure
i
never
knew
the
name
was
so
pretty
before
pen
said
is
a
very
pretty
name
ophelia
said
pentweazle
not
a
pretty
name
remember
papa
when
we
were
on
the
norwich
circuit
young
pentweazle
who
used
to
play
second
old
men
and
married
miss
rancy
the
columbine
they
both
engaged
in
london
now
at
the
queen
and
get
five
pounds
a
week
pentweazle
was
his
real
name
was
judkin
gave
it
him
i
do
know
why
his
name
was
harrington
that
is
his
real
name
was
potts
fawther
a
clergyman
very
respectable
harrington
was
in
london
and
got
in
debt
ye
remember
he
came
out
in
falkland
to
bunce
and
a
pretty
julia
she
was
the
captain
interposed
a
woman
of
fifty
and
a
mother
of
ten
children
is
you
ought
to
have
been
julia
or
my
name
not
jack
i
did
take
the
leading
business
then
miss
fotheringay
said
modestly
i
was
fit
till
bows
taught
true
for
you
my
dear
said
the
captain
and
bending
to
pendennis
he
added
rejuiced
in
circumstances
sir
i
was
for
some
time
a
in
dublin
there
only
three
men
in
the
empire
could
touch
me
with
the
foil
once
but
jack
costigan
getting
old
and
stiff
now
sir
and
my
daughter
had
an
engagement
at
the
thayater
there
and
there
that
my
friend
bows
who
saw
her
capabilities
and
is
an
uncommon
man
gave
her
lessons
in
the
dramatic
art
and
made
her
what
ye
see
what
have
ye
done
since
bows
went
emily
sure
i
made
a
pie
emily
said
with
perfect
simplicity
she
pronounced
it
if
ye
try
it
at
four
sir
say
the
word
said
costigan
gallantly
that
girl
sir
makes
the
best
veal
and
ham
pie
in
england
and
i
think
i
can
promise
ye
a
glass
of
punch
of
the
right
pen
had
promised
to
be
at
home
to
dinner
at
six
but
the
rascal
thought
he
could
accommodate
pleasure
and
duty
in
this
point
and
was
only
too
eager
to
accept
this
invitation
he
looked
on
with
delight
and
wonder
whilst
ophelia
busied
herself
about
the
room
and
prepared
for
the
dinner
she
arranged
the
glasses
and
laid
and
smoothed
the
little
cloth
all
which
duties
she
performed
with
a
quiet
grace
and
good
humour
which
enchanted
her
guest
more
and
more
the
poy
arrived
from
the
baker
in
the
hands
of
one
of
the
little
brothers
at
the
proper
hour
and
at
four
pen
found
himself
at
dinner
actually
at
dinner
with
the
greatest
tragic
actress
in
the
world
and
her
father
with
the
handsomest
woman
in
all
creation
with
his
first
and
only
love
whom
he
had
adored
ever
since
when
ever
since
yesterday
ever
since
for
ever
he
ate
a
crust
of
her
making
he
poured
her
out
a
glass
of
beer
he
saw
her
drink
a
glass
of
punch
just
one
full
out
of
the
tumbler
which
she
mixed
for
her
papa
she
was
perfectly
and
offered
to
mix
one
for
pendennis
too
it
was
prodigiously
strong
pen
had
never
in
his
life
drunk
so
much
spirits
and
water
was
it
the
punch
or
the
who
intoxicated
him
during
dinner
when
the
captain
whom
his
daughter
treated
most
respectfully
ceased
prattling
about
himself
and
his
adventures
pen
tried
to
engage
the
fotheringay
in
conversation
about
poetry
and
about
her
profession
he
asked
her
what
she
thought
of
ophelia
madness
and
whether
she
was
in
love
with
hamlet
or
not
in
love
with
such
a
little
ojous
wretch
as
that
stunted
manager
of
a
bingley
she
bristled
with
indignation
at
the
thought
pen
explained
it
was
not
of
her
he
spoke
but
of
ophelia
of
the
play
oh
indeed
if
no
offence
was
meant
none
was
taken
but
as
for
bingley
indeed
she
did
not
value
him
not
that
glass
of
pen
next
tried
her
on
kotzebue
kotzebue
who
was
he
the
author
of
the
play
in
which
she
had
been
performing
so
she
did
not
know
that
the
man
name
at
the
beginning
of
the
book
was
thompson
she
said
pen
laughed
at
her
adorable
simplicity
he
told
her
of
the
melancholy
fate
of
the
author
of
the
play
and
how
sand
had
killed
him
it
was
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
miss
costigan
had
ever
heard
of
kotzebue
existence
but
she
looked
as
if
she
was
very
much
interested
and
her
sympathy
sufficed
for
honest
pen
and
in
the
midst
of
this
simple
conversation
the
hour
and
a
quarter
which
poor
pen
could
afford
to
allow
himself
passed
away
only
too
quickly
and
he
had
taken
leave
he
was
gone
and
away
on
his
rapid
road
homewards
on
the
back
of
rebecca
she
was
called
upon
to
show
her
mettle
in
the
three
journeys
which
she
made
that
day
what
was
that
he
was
talking
about
the
madness
of
hamlet
and
the
theory
of
the
great
german
critic
on
the
subject
emily
asked
of
her
father
then
i
do
know
milly
dear
answered
the
captain
we
ask
bows
when
he
anyhow
he
a
nice
pretty
young
man
the
lady
said
how
many
tickets
did
he
take
of
you
faith
then
he
took
six
and
gev
me
two
guineas
milly
the
captain
said
i
suppose
them
young
chaps
is
not
too
flush
of
he
full
of
miss
fotheringay
continued
kotzebue
he
he
what
a
droll
name
indeed
now
and
the
poor
fellow
killed
by
sand
too
did
ye
ever
hear
such
a
thing
i
ask
bows
about
it
papa
a
queer
death
sure
enough
ejaculated
the
captain
and
changed
the
painful
theme
is
an
elegant
mare
the
young
gentleman
rides
costigan
went
on
to
say
and
a
grand
breakfast
intirely
that
young
mister
foker
gave
he
good
for
two
private
boxes
and
at
leest
twenty
tickets
i
should
say
cried
the
daughter
a
prudent
lass
who
always
kept
her
fine
eyes
on
the
main
chance
i
go
bail
of
that
answered
the
papa
and
so
their
conversation
continued
awhile
until
the
tumbler
of
punch
was
finished
and
their
hour
of
departure
soon
came
too
for
at
six
miss
fotheringay
was
to
appear
at
the
theatre
again
whither
her
father
always
accompanied
her
and
stood
as
we
have
seen
in
the
watching
her
and
drank
in
the
with
the
company
there
how
beautiful
she
is
thought
pen
cantering
homewards
how
simple
and
how
tender
how
charming
it
is
to
see
a
woman
of
her
commanding
genius
busying
herself
with
the
delightful
though
humble
offices
of
domestic
life
cooking
dishes
to
make
her
old
father
comfortable
and
brewing
drink
for
him
with
her
delicate
fingers
how
rude
it
was
of
me
to
begin
to
talk
about
professional
matters
and
how
well
she
turned
the
conversation
by
the
way
she
talked
about
professional
matters
herself
but
then
with
what
fun
and
humour
she
told
the
story
of
her
comrade
pentweazle
as
he
was
called
there
is
no
humour
like
irish
humour
her
father
is
rather
tedious
but
thoroughly
amiable
and
how
fine
of
him
giving
lessons
in
fencing
after
he
quitted
the
army
where
he
was
the
pet
of
the
duke
of
kent
fencing
i
should
like
to
continue
my
fencing
or
i
shall
forget
what
angelo
taught
me
uncle
arthur
always
liked
me
to
fence
he
says
it
is
the
exercise
of
a
gentleman
hang
it
i
take
some
lessons
of
captain
costigan
go
along
rebecca
up
the
hill
old
lady
pendennis
pendennis
how
she
spoke
the
word
emily
emily
how
good
how
noble
how
beautiful
how
perfect
she
is
now
the
reader
who
has
had
the
benefit
of
overhearing
the
entire
conversation
which
pen
had
with
miss
fotheringay
can
judge
for
himself
about
the
powers
of
her
mind
and
may
perhaps
be
disposed
to
think
that
she
has
not
said
anything
astonishingly
humorous
or
intellectual
in
the
course
of
the
above
interview
she
has
married
and
taken
her
position
in
the
world
as
the
most
spotless
and
irreproachable
lady
since
and
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
making
her
acquaintance
and
must
certainly
own
against
my
friend
pen
opinion
that
his
adored
emily
is
not
a
clever
woman
the
truth
is
she
had
not
only
never
heard
of
kotzebue
but
she
had
never
heard
of
farquhar
or
congreve
or
any
dramatist
in
whose
plays
she
had
not
a
part
and
of
these
dramas
she
only
knew
the
part
which
concerned
herself
a
wag
once
told
her
that
dante
was
born
at
algiers
and
asked
her
which
johnson
wrote
first
or
man
in
his
humour
but
she
had
the
best
of
the
joke
for
she
had
never
heard
of
irene
or
every
man
in
his
humour
or
dante
or
perhaps
algiers
it
was
all
one
to
her
she
acted
what
little
bows
told
her
where
he
told
her
to
sob
she
sobbed
where
he
told
her
to
laugh
she
laughed
she
gave
the
tirade
or
the
repartee
without
the
slightest
notion
of
its
meaning
she
went
to
church
and
goes
every
sunday
with
a
reputation
perfectly
intact
and
was
and
is
as
guiltless
of
sense
as
of
any
other
crime
but
what
did
our
pen
know
of
these
things
he
saw
a
pair
of
bright
eyes
and
he
believed
in
them
a
beautiful
image
and
he
fell
down
and
worshipped
it
he
supplied
the
meaning
which
her
words
wanted
and
created
the
divinity
which
he
loved
was
titania
the
first
who
fell
in
love
with
an
ass
or
pygmalion
the
only
artist
who
has
gone
crazy
about
a
stone
he
had
found
her
he
had
found
what
his
soul
thirsted
after
he
flung
himself
into
the
stream
and
drank
with
all
his
might
let
those
say
who
have
been
thirsty
once
how
delicious
that
first
draught
is
as
he
rode
down
the
avenue
towards
home
pen
shrieked
with
laughter
as
he
saw
the
reverend
smirke
once
more
coming
demurely
away
from
fairoaks
on
his
pony
smirke
had
dawdled
and
stayed
at
the
cottages
on
the
way
and
then
dawdled
with
laura
over
her
lessons
and
then
looked
at
pendennis
gardens
and
improvements
until
he
had
perfectly
bored
out
that
lady
and
he
had
taken
his
leave
at
the
very
last
minute
without
that
invitation
to
dinner
which
he
fondly
expected
pen
was
full
of
kindness
and
triumph
what
picked
up
and
sound
he
cried
out
laughing
come
along
back
old
fellow
and
eat
my
dinner
i
have
had
mine
but
we
will
have
a
bottle
of
the
old
wine
and
drink
her
health
poor
smirke
turned
the
pony
head
round
and
jogged
along
with
arthur
his
mother
was
charmed
to
see
him
in
such
high
spirits
and
welcomed
smirke
for
his
sake
when
arthur
said
he
had
forced
the
curate
back
to
dine
he
gave
a
most
ludicrous
account
of
the
play
of
the
night
before
and
of
the
acting
of
bingley
the
manager
in
his
rickety
hessians
and
the
enormous
bingley
as
the
countess
in
rumpled
green
satin
and
a
polish
cap
he
mimicked
them
and
delighted
his
mother
and
little
laura
who
clapped
her
hands
with
pleasure
and
haller
said
pendennis
she
a
stunner
pen
said
laughing
and
using
the
words
of
his
revered
friend
foker
a
what
arthur
asked
the
lady
what
is
a
stunner
arthur
cried
laura
in
the
same
voice
so
he
gave
them
a
queer
account
of
foker
and
how
he
used
to
be
called
vats
and
grains
and
by
other
contumelious
names
at
school
and
how
he
was
now
exceedingly
rich
and
a
fellow
commoner
at
boniface
but
gay
and
communicative
as
he
was
mr
pen
did
not
say
one
syllable
about
his
ride
to
chatteris
that
day
or
about
the
new
friends
whom
he
had
made
there
when
the
two
ladies
retired
pen
with
flashing
eyes
filled
up
two
great
bumpers
of
madeira
and
looking
smirke
full
in
the
face
said
here
to
her
here
to
her
said
the
curate
with
a
sigh
lifting
the
glass
and
emptying
it
so
that
his
face
was
a
little
pink
when
he
put
it
down
pen
had
even
less
sleep
that
night
than
on
the
night
before
in
the
morning
and
almost
before
dawn
he
went
out
and
saddled
that
unfortunate
rebecca
himself
and
rode
her
on
the
downs
like
mad
again
love
had
roused
him
and
said
awake
pendennis
i
am
that
charming
fever
that
delicious
longing
and
fire
and
uncertainty
he
hugged
them
to
him
he
would
not
have
lost
them
for
all
the
world
chapter
vi
contains
both
love
and
war
cicero
and
euripides
did
not
occupy
mr
pen
much
for
some
time
after
this
and
honest
smirke
had
a
very
easy
time
with
his
pupil
rebecca
was
the
animal
who
suffered
most
in
the
present
state
of
pen
mind
for
besides
those
days
when
he
could
publicly
announce
his
intention
of
going
to
chatteris
to
take
a
and
went
thither
with
the
knowledge
of
his
mother
whenever
he
saw
three
hours
clear
before
him
the
young
rascal
made
a
rush
for
the
city
and
found
his
way
to
lane
he
was
as
frantic
with
vexation
when
rebecca
went
lame
as
richard
at
bosworth
when
his
horse
was
killed
under
him
and
got
deeply
into
the
books
of
the
man
who
kept
the
at
chatteris
for
the
doctoring
of
his
own
and
the
hire
of
another
animal
then
and
perhaps
once
in
a
week
under
pretence
of
going
to
read
a
greek
play
with
smirke
this
young
reprobate
set
off
so
as
to
be
in
time
for
the
competitor
down
coach
stayed
a
couple
of
hours
in
chatteris
and
returned
on
the
rival
which
left
for
london
at
ten
at
night
once
his
secret
was
nearly
lost
by
smirke
simplicity
of
whom
pendennis
asked
whether
they
had
read
a
great
deal
the
night
before
or
a
question
to
that
effect
smirke
was
about
to
tell
the
truth
that
he
had
never
seen
mr
pen
at
all
when
the
latter
came
grinding
down
on
smirke
toe
under
the
table
and
warned
the
curate
not
to
betray
him
they
had
had
conversations
on
the
tender
subject
of
course
it
is
good
sport
if
you
are
not
yourself
engaged
in
the
conversation
to
hear
two
men
in
love
talk
there
must
be
a
confidant
and
depositary
somewhere
when
informed
under
the
most
solemn
vows
of
secrecy
of
pen
condition
of
mind
the
curate
said
with
no
small
tremor
that
he
hoped
it
was
no
unworthy
object
no
unlawful
attachment
which
pen
had
formed
for
if
so
the
poor
fellow
felt
it
would
be
his
duty
to
break
his
vow
and
inform
pen
mother
and
then
there
would
be
a
quarrel
he
felt
with
sickening
apprehension
and
he
would
never
again
have
a
chance
of
seeing
what
he
most
liked
in
the
world
unlawful
unworthy
pen
bounced
out
at
the
curate
question
she
is
as
pure
as
she
is
beautiful
i
would
give
my
heart
to
no
other
woman
i
keep
the
matter
a
secret
in
my
family
because
because
there
are
reasons
of
a
weighty
nature
which
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
disclose
but
any
man
who
breathes
a
word
against
her
purity
insults
both
her
honour
and
mine
and
and
dammy
i
wo
stand
smirke
with
a
faint
laugh
only
said
well
well
do
call
me
out
arthur
for
you
know
i
ca
fight
but
by
this
compromise
the
wretched
curate
was
put
more
than
ever
into
the
power
of
his
pupil
and
the
greek
and
mathematics
suffered
correspondingly
if
the
reverend
gentleman
had
had
much
discernment
and
looked
into
the
poet
corner
of
the
county
chronicle
as
it
arrived
in
the
bag
he
might
have
seen
haller
and
genius
to
miss
fotheringay
of
the
theatre
royal
appearing
every
week
and
other
verses
of
the
most
gloomy
thrilling
and
passionate
cast
but
as
these
poems
were
no
longer
signed
nep
by
their
artful
composer
but
subscribed
eros
neither
the
tutor
nor
helen
the
good
soul
who
cut
all
her
verses
out
of
the
paper
knew
that
nep
was
no
other
than
that
flaming
eros
who
sang
so
vehemently
the
character
of
the
new
actress
who
is
the
lady
at
last
asked
pendennis
whom
your
rival
is
always
singing
in
the
county
chronicle
he
writes
something
like
you
dear
pen
but
yours
is
much
the
best
have
you
seen
miss
fotheringay
pen
said
yes
he
had
that
night
he
went
to
see
the
stranger
she
acted
haller
by
the
way
she
was
going
to
have
a
benefit
and
was
to
appear
in
ophelia
suppose
we
were
to
go
shakspeare
you
know
mother
we
can
get
horses
from
the
clavering
arms
little
laura
sprang
up
with
delight
she
longed
for
a
play
pen
introduced
shakspeare
you
know
because
the
deceased
pendennis
as
became
a
man
of
his
character
professed
an
uncommon
respect
for
the
bard
of
avon
in
whose
works
he
safely
said
there
was
more
poetry
than
in
all
poets
put
together
and
though
pendennis
did
not
much
read
the
works
in
question
yet
he
enjoined
pen
to
peruse
them
and
often
said
what
pleasure
he
should
have
when
the
boy
was
of
a
proper
age
in
taking
him
and
mother
to
see
some
good
plays
of
the
immortal
poet
the
ready
tears
welled
up
in
the
kind
mother
eyes
as
she
remembered
these
speeches
of
the
man
who
was
gone
she
kissed
her
son
fondly
and
said
she
would
go
laura
jumped
for
joy
was
pen
happy
was
he
ashamed
as
he
held
his
mother
to
him
he
longed
to
tell
her
all
but
he
kept
his
counsel
he
would
see
how
his
mother
liked
her
the
play
should
be
the
thing
and
he
would
try
his
mother
like
hamlet
helen
in
her
good
humour
asked
smirke
to
be
of
the
party
that
ecclesiastic
had
been
bred
up
by
a
fond
parent
at
clapham
who
had
an
objection
to
dramatic
entertainments
and
he
had
never
yet
seen
a
play
but
shakspeare
but
to
go
with
pendennis
in
her
carriage
and
sit
a
whole
night
by
her
side
he
could
not
resist
the
idea
of
so
much
pleasure
and
made
a
feeble
speech
in
which
he
spoke
of
temptation
and
gratitude
and
finally
accepted
pendennis
most
kind
offer
as
he
spoke
he
gave
her
a
look
which
made
her
exceedingly
uncomfortable
she
had
seen
that
look
more
than
once
of
late
pursuing
her
he
became
more
positively
odious
every
day
in
the
widow
eyes
we
are
not
going
to
say
a
great
deal
about
pen
courtship
of
miss
fotheringay
for
the
reader
has
already
had
a
specimen
of
her
conversation
much
of
which
need
surely
not
be
reported
pen
sate
with
her
hour
after
hour
and
poured
forth
all
his
honest
boyish
soul
to
her
everything
he
knew
or
hoped
or
felt
or
had
read
or
fancied
he
told
to
her
he
never
tired
of
talking
and
longing
one
after
another
as
his
thoughts
rose
in
his
hot
eager
brain
he
clothed
them
in
words
and
told
them
to
her
her
part
of
the
was
not
to
talk
but
to
appear
as
if
she
understood
what
pen
talked
a
difficult
matter
for
the
young
fellow
blurted
out
no
small
quantity
of
nonsense
and
to
look
exceedingly
handsome
and
sympathising
the
fact
is
whilst
he
was
making
one
of
his
tirades
and
delighted
perhaps
and
wondering
at
his
own
eloquence
the
lad
would
go
on
for
twenty
minutes
at
a
time
the
lovely
emily
who
could
not
comprehend
a
tenth
part
of
his
talk
had
leisure
to
think
about
her
own
affairs
and
would
arrange
in
her
own
mind
how
they
should
dress
the
cold
mutton
or
how
she
would
turn
the
black
satin
or
make
herself
out
of
her
scarf
a
bonnet
like
miss
thackthwaite
new
one
and
so
forth
pen
spouted
byron
and
moore
passion
and
poetry
her
business
was
to
throw
up
her
eyes
or
fixing
them
for
a
moment
on
his
face
to
cry
oh
is
beautiful
ah
how
exquisite
repeat
those
lines
and
off
the
boy
went
and
she
returned
to
her
own
simple
thoughts
about
the
turned
gown
or
the
hashed
mutton
in
fact
pen
passion
was
not
long
a
secret
from
the
lovely
emily
or
her
father
upon
his
second
visit
his
admiration
was
quite
evident
to
both
of
them
and
on
his
departure
the
old
gentleman
said
to
his
daughter
as
he
winked
at
her
over
his
glass
of
grog
faith
milly
darling
i
think
ye
hooked
that
pooh
is
only
a
boy
papa
dear
milly
remarked
sure
he
but
a
pen
would
have
been
very
much
pleased
if
he
had
heard
that
phrase
he
was
galloping
home
wild
with
pleasure
and
shouting
out
her
name
as
he
rode
ye
hooked
any
how
said
the
captain
and
let
me
tell

not
a
bad

asked

milly
seriously
ye

at
dublin
how
ye
went
on
about
young
poldoody
and
i
a
whole
desk
full
of
verses
he
wrote
me
when
he
was
in
trinity
college
but
he
went
abroad
and
his
mother
married
him
to
an
lord

a
young
nobleman

in
them

in
the
position
in
which

young

beautiful
ye
need
be
afraid
about
the
young
chap
i
think
i
old
enough
to
take
care
of
myself
captain
so
pen
used
to
come
day
after
day
rushing
in
and
galloping
away
and
growing
more
wild
about
the
girl
with
every
visit
sometimes
the
captain
was
present
at
their
meetings
but
having
a
perfect
confidence
in
his
daughter
he
was
more
often
inclined
to
leave
the
young
couple
to
themselves
and
cocked
his
hat
over
his
eye
and
strutted
off
on
some
errand
when
pen
entered
how
delightful
those
interviews
were
the
captain
was
a
low
wainscoted
room
with
a
large
window
looking
into
the
dean
garden
there
pen
sate
and
talked
and
talked
emily
looking
beautiful
as
she
sate
at
her
work
looking
beautiful
and
calm
and
the
sunshine
came
streaming
in
at
the
great
windows
and
lighted
up
her
superb
face
and
form
in
the
midst
of
the
conversation
the
great
bell
would
begin
to
boom
and
he
would
pause
smiling
and
be
silent
until
the
sound
of
the
vast
music
died
away
or
the
rooks
in
the
cathedral
elms
would
make
a
great
noise
towards
sunset
or
the
sound
of
the
organ
and
the
choristers
would
come
over
the
quiet
air
and
gently
hush
pen
talking
by
the
way
it
must
be
said
that
miss
fotheringay
in
a
plain
shawl
and
a
close
bonnet
and
veil
went
to
church
every
sunday
of
her
life
accompanied
by
her
indefatigable
father
who
gave
the
responses
in
a
very
rich
and
fine
brogue
joined
in
the
psalms
and
chanting
and
behaved
in
the
most
exemplary
manner
little
bows
the
of
the
family
was
exceedingly
wroth
at
the
notion
of
miss
fotheringay
marriage
with
a
stripling
seven
or
eight
years
her
junior
bows
who
was
a
cripple
and
owned
that
he
was
a
little
more
deformed
even
than
bingley
the
manager
so
that
he
could
not
appear
on
the
stage
was
a
singular
wild
man
of
no
small
talents
and
humour
attracted
first
by
miss
fotheringay
beauty
he
began
to
teach
her
how
to
act
he
shrieked
out
in
his
cracked
voice
the
parts
and
his
pupil
learned
them
from
his
lips
by
rote
and
repeated
them
in
her
full
rich
tones
he
indicated
the
attitudes
and
set
and
moved
those
beautiful
arms
of
hers
those
who
remember
this
grand
actress
on
the
stage
can
recall
how
she
used
always
precisely
the
same
gestures
looks
and
tones
how
she
stood
on
the
same
plank
of
the
stage
in
the
same
position
rolled
her
eyes
at
the
same
instant
and
to
the
same
degree
and
wept
with
precisely
the
same
pathos
and
over
the
same
pathetic
syllable
and
after
she
had
come
out
trembling
with
emotion
before
the
audience
and
looking
so
exhausted
and
tearful
that
you
fancied
she
would
faint
with
sensibility
she
would
gather
up
her
hair
the
instant
she
was
behind
the
curtain
and
go
home
to
a
and
a
glass
of
brown
stout
and
the
harrowing
labours
of
the
day
over
she
went
to
bed
and
snored
as
resolutely
and
as
regularly
as
a
porter
bows
then
was
indignant
at
the
notion
that
his
pupil
should
throw
her
chances
away
in
life
by
bestowing
her
hand
upon
a
little
country
squire
as
soon
as
a
london
manager
saw
her
he
prophesied
that
she
would
get
a
london
engagement
and
a
great
success
the
misfortune
was
that
the
london
managers
had
seen
her
she
had
played
in
london
three
years
before
and
failed
from
utter
stupidity
since
then
it
was
that
bows
had
taken
her
in
hand
and
taught
her
part
after
part
how
he
worked
and
screamed
and
twisted
and
repeated
lines
over
and
over
again
and
with
what
indomitable
patience
and
dulness
she
followed
him
she
knew
that
he
made
her
and
let
herself
be
made
she
was
not
grateful
or
ungrateful
or
unkind
or
she
was
only
stupid
and
pen
was
madly
in
love
with
her
the
from
the
clavering
arms
arrived
in
due
time
and
carried
the
party
to
the
theatre
at
chatteris
where
pen
was
gratified
in
perceiving
that
a
tolerably
large
audience
was
assembled
the
young
gentlemen
from
baymouth
had
a
box
in
the
front
of
which
sate
foker
and
his
friend
spavin
splendidly
attired
in
the
most
evening
costume
they
saluted
pen
in
a
cordial
manner
and
examined
his
party
of
which
they
approved
for
little
laura
was
a
pretty
little
girl
with
a
quantity
of
shining
brown
ringlets
and
pendennis
dressed
in
black
velvet
with
the
diamond
cross
which
she
sported
on
great
occasions
looked
uncommonly
handsome
and
majestic
behind
these
sate
arthur

the
gentle
smirke
with
the
curl
reposing
on
his
fair
forehead
and
his
white
tie
in
perfect
order
he
blushed
to
find
himself
in
such
a
place
but
how
happy
was
he
to
be
there
he
and
pendennis
brought
books
of
with
them
to
follow
the
tragedy
as
is
the
custom
of
honest
countryfolks
who
go
to
a
play
in
state
samuel
coachman
groom
and
gardener
to
pendennis
took
his
place
in
the
pit
where
foker

was
also
visible
it
was
dotted
with
officers
of
the
dragoons
whose
band
by
kind
permission
of
colonel
swallowtail
were
as
usual
in
the
orchestra
and
that
corpulent
and
distinguished
warrior
himself
with
his
waterloo
medal
and
a
number
of
his
young
men
made
a
handsome
show
in
the
boxes
who
is
that
person
bowing
to
you
arthur
pendennis
asked
of
her
son
pen
blushed
a
great
deal
his
name
is
captain
costigan
he
said
a
peninsular
in
fact
it
was
the
captain
in
a
new
shoot
of
clothes
as
he
called
them
and
with
a
large
pair
of
white
kid
gloves
one
of
which
he
waved
to
pendennis
whilst
he
laid
the
other
sprawling
over
his
heart
and
pen
did
not
say
any
more
and
how
was
pendennis
to
know
that
costigan
was
the
father
of

fotheringay
hornbull
from
london
was
the
hamlet
of

night

modestly
contenting
himself
with
the
part
of

and
reserving
his
chief
strength
for
william
in
susan
which
was
the
second
piece
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
play

to
say
that

lovely
and
performed
with
admirable
wild
pathos

her
beautiful
white
arms
and

and
songs
with
the
most
charming
madness
what
an
opportunity
her
splendid
black
hair
had
of
tossing
over
her
shoulders
she
made
the
most
charming
corpse
ever
seen
and
while
hamlet
and
laertes
were
battling
in
her
grave
she
was
looking
out
from
the
back
scenes
with
some
curiosity
towards
pen
box
and
the
family
party
assembled
in
it
there
was
but
one
voice
in
her
praise
there
pendennis
was
in
ecstasies
with
her
beauty
little
laura
was
bewildered
by
the
piece
and
the
ghost
and
the
play
within
the
play
during
which
as
hamlet
lay
at
ophelia
knee
pen
felt
that
he
would
have
liked
to
strangle
hornbull
but
cried
out
great
praises
of
that
beautiful
young
creature
pen
was
charmed
with
the
effect
which
she
produced
on
his
mother
and
the
clergyman
for
his
part
was
exceedingly
enthusiastic
when
the
curtain
fell
upon
that
group
of
slaughtered
personages
who
are
despatched
so
suddenly
at
the
end
of
and
whose
demise
astonished
poor
little
laura
not
a
little
there
was
an
immense
shouting
and
applause
from
all
quarters
of
the
house
the
intrepid
smirke
violently
excited
clapped
his
hands
and
cried
out
bravo
bravo
as
loud
as
the
dragoon
officers
themselves
these
were
greatly
moved
ils
sur
leurs
bancs
to
borrow
a
phrase
from
our
neighbours
they
were
led
cheering
into
action
by
the
portly
swallowtail
who
waved
his
cap
the
officers
in
the
pit
of
course
gallantly
following
their
chiefs
there
was
a
roar
of
bravos
rang
through
the
house
pen
bellowing
with
the
loudest
fotheringay
fotheringay
and
spavin
and
foker
giving
the
from
their
box
even
pendennis
began
to
wave
about
her
and
little
laura
danced
laughed
clapped
and
looked
up
at
pen
with
wonder
hornbull
led
the
beneficiaire
forward
amidst
bursts
of
enthusiasm
and
she
looked
so
handsome
and
radiant
with
her
hair
still
over
her
shoulders
that
pen
hardly
could
contain
himself
for
rapture
and
he
leaned
over
his
mother
chair
and
shouted
and
hurrayed
and
waved
his
hat
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
keep
his
secret
from
helen
and
not
say
look
that
the
woman
is
she
peerless
i
tell
you
i
love
but
he
disguised
these
feelings
under
an
enormous
bellowing
and
hurraying
as
for
miss
fotheringay
and
her
behaviour
the
reader
is
referred
to
a
former
page
for
an
account
of
that
she
went
through
precisely
the
same
business
she
surveyed
the
house
all
round
with
glances
of
gratitude
and
trembled
and
almost
sank
with
emotion
over
her
favourite
she
seized
the
flowers
foker
discharged
a
prodigious
bouquet
at
her
and
even
smirke
made
a
feeble
shy
with
a
rose
and
blushed
dreadfully
when
it
fell
into
the
pit
she
seized
the
flowers
and
pressed
them
to
her
swelling
heart
in
a
word
we
refer
the
reader
to
earlier
pages
twinkling
in
her
breast
poor
old
pen
saw
a
locket
which
he
had
bought
of
nathan
in
high
street
with
the
last
shilling
he
was
worth
and
a
sovereign
borrowed
from
smirke
susan
followed
at
which
sweet
story
our
friends
were
exceedingly
charmed
and
affected
and
in
which
susan
with
a
russet
gown
and
a
pink
ribbon
in
her
cap
looked
to
the
full
as
lovely
as
ophelia
bingley
was
great
in
william
goll
as
the
admiral
looked
like
the
of
a
and
garbetts
as
captain
boldweather
a
miscreant
who
forms
a
plan
for
carrying
off
susan
and
waving
an
immense
cocked
hat
says
come
what
may
he
will
be
the
ruin
of
her
all
these
performed
their
parts
with
their
accustomed
talent
and
it
was
with
a
sincere
regret
that
all
our
friends
saw
the
curtain
drop
down
and
end
that
pretty
and
tender
story
if
pen
had
been
alone
with
his
mother
in
the
carriage
as
they
went
home
he
would
have
told
her
all
that
night
but
he
sate
on
the
box
in
the
moonshine
smoking
a
cigar
by
the
side
of
smirke
who
warmed
himself
with
a
comforter
foker
tandem
and
lamps
whirled
by
the
sober
old
clavering
posters
as
they
were
a
couple
of
miles
on
their
road
home
and
spavin
saluted
pendennis
carriage
with
some
considerable
variations
of
rule
britannia
on
the
it
happened
two
days
after
the
above
gaieties
that
dean
of
chatteris
entertained
a
few
select
clerical
friends
at
dinner
at
his
deanery
home
that
they
drank
uncommonly
good
port
wine
and
abused
the
bishop
over
their
dessert
are
very
likely
matters
but
with
such
we
have
nothing
at
present
to
do
our
friend
doctor
portman
of
clavering
was
one
of
the
dean
guests
and
being
a
gallant
man
and
seeing
from
his
place
at
the
mahogany
the
dean
lady
walking
up
and
down
the
grass
with
her
children
sporting
around
her
and
her
pink
parasol
over
her
lovely
head
the
doctor
stept
out
of
the
french
windows
of
the
into
the
lawn
which
skirts
that
apartment
and
left
the
other
white
neckcloths
to
gird
at
my
lord
bishop
then
the
doctor
went
up
and
offered
dean
his
arm
and
they
sauntered
over
the
ancient
velvet
lawn
which
had
been
mowed
and
rolled
for
immemorial
deans
in
that
easy
quiet
comfortable
manner
in
which
people
of
middle
age
and
good
temper
walk
after
a
good
dinner
in
a
calm
golden
summer
evening
when
the
sun
has
but
just
sunk
behind
the
enormous
and
the
moon
is
growing
every
instant
brighter
in
the
heavens
now
at
the
end
of
the
dean
garden
there
is
as
we
have
stated
creed
house
and
the
windows
of
the
room
were
open
to
admit
the
pleasant
summer
air
a
young
lady
of
whose
eyes
were
perfectly
wide
open
and
a
luckless
boy
of
eighteen
blind
with
love
and
infatuation
were
in
that
chamber
together
in
which
persons
as
we
have
before
seen
them
in
the
same
place
the
reader
will
have
no
difficulty
in
recognising
arthur
pendennis
and
miss
costigan
the
poor
boy
had
taken
the
plunge
trembling
with
passionate
emotion
his
heart
beating
and
throbbing
fiercely
tears
rushing
forth
in
spite
of
him
his
voice
almost
choking
with
feeling
poor
pen
had
said
those
words
which
he
could
withhold
no
more
and
flung
himself
and
his
whole
store
of
love
and
admiration
and
ardour
at
the
feet
of
this
mature
beauty
is
he
the
first
who
has
done
so
have
none
before
or
after
him
staked
all
their
treasure
of
life
as
a
savage
does
his
land
and
possessions
against
a
draught
of
the
or
a
couple
of
bauble
eyes
does
your
mother
know
of
this
arthur
said
miss
fotheringay
slowly
he
seized
her
hand
madly
and
kissed
it
a
thousand
times
she
did
not
withdraw
it
does
the
old
lady
know
it
miss
costigan
thought
to
herself
well
perhaps
she
may
and
then
she
remembered
what
a
handsome
diamond
cross
pendennis
had
on
the
night
of
the
play
and
thought
sure
go
in
the
calm
yourself
dear
arthur
she
said
in
her
low
rich
voice
and
sniffled
sweetly
and
gravely
upon
him
then
with
her
disengaged
hand
she
put
the
hair
lightly
off
his
throbbing
forehead
he
was
in
such
a
rapture
and
whirl
of
happiness
that
he
could
hardly
speak
at
last
he
gasped
out
my
mother
has
seen
you
and
admires
you
beyond
measure
she
will
learn
to
love
you
soon
who
can
do
otherwise
she
will
love
you
because
i
then
i
think
you
do
said
miss
costigan
perhaps
with
a
sort
of
pity
for
pen
think
she
did
of
course
here
mr
pen
went
off
into
a
rhapsody
through
which
as
we
have
perfect
command
over
our
own
feelings
we
have
no
reason
to
follow
the
lad
of
course
love
truth
and
eternity
were
produced
and
words
were
tried
but
found
impossible
to
plumb
the
tremendous
depth
of
his
affection
this
speech
we
say
is
no
business
of
ours
it
was
most
likely
not
very
wise
but
what
right
have
we
to
overhear
let
the
poor
boy
fling
out
his
simple
heart
at
the
feet
and
deal
gently
with
him
it
is
best
to
love
wisely
no
doubt
but
to
love
foolishly
is
better
than
not
to
be
able
to
love
at
all
some
of
us
ca
and
are
proud
of
our
impotence
too
at
the
end
of
his
speech
pen
again
kissed
the
imperial
hand
with
rapture
and
i
believe
it
was
at
this
very
moment
and
while
dean
and
doctor
portman
were
engaged
in
conversation
that
young
master
ridley
roset
her
son
pulled
his
mother
by
the
back
of
her
capacious
dress
and
said
i
say
ma
look
up
there
and
he
waggled
his
innocent
head
that
was
indeed
a
view
from
the
dean
garden
such
as
seldom
is
seen
by
deans
or
is
written
in
chapters
there
was
poor
pen
performing
a
salute
upon
the
rosy
fingers
of
his
charmer
who
received
the
embrace
with
perfect
calmness
and
good
humour
master
ridley
looked
up
and
grinned
little
miss
rosa
looked
at
her
brother
and
opened
the
mouth
of
astonishment
dean
countenance
defied
expression
and
as
for
portman
when
he
beheld
the
scene
and
saw
his
prime
favourite
and
dear
pupil
pen
he
stood
mute
with
rage
and
wonder
haller
spied
the
party
below
at
the
same
moment
and
gave
a
start
and
a
laugh
sure
there
somebody
in
the
dean
garden
she
cried
out
and
withdrew
with
perfect
calmness
whilst
pen
darted
away
with
his
face
glowing
like
coals
the
garden
party
had
the
house
when
he
ventured
to
look
out
again
the
sickle
moon
was
blazing
bright
in
the
heavens
then
the
stars
were
glittering
the
bell
of
the
cathedral
tolling
nine
the
dean
guests
all
save
one
who
had
called
for
his
horse
dumpling
and
ridden
off
early
were
partaking
of
tea
and
buttered
cakes
in
dean
when
pen
took
leave
of
miss
costigan
pen
arrived
at
home
in
due
time
afterwards
and
was
going
to
slip
off
to
bed
for
the
poor
lad
was
greatly
worn
and
agitated
and
his
nerves
had
been
at
almost
a
maddening
pitch
when
a
summons
came
to
him
by
john
the
old
footman
whose
countenance
bore
a
very
ominous
look
that
his
mother
must
see
him
below
on
this
he
tied
on
his
neckcloth
again
and
went
downstairs
to
the
there
sate
not
only
his
mother
but
her
friend
the
reverend
doctor
portman
helen
face
looked
very
pale
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
the
doctor
was
flushed
on
the
contrary
and
quivering
with
anger
and
emotion
pen
saw
at
once
that
there
was
a
crisis
and
that
there
had
been
a
discovery
now
for
it
he
thought
where
have
you
been
arthur
helen
said
in
a
trembling
voice
how
can
you
look
that
that
dear
lady
and
a
christian
clergyman
in
the
face
sir
bounced
out
the
doctor
in
spite
of
helen
pale
appealing
looks
where
has
he
been
where
his
mother
son
should
have
been
ashamed
to
go
for
your
mother
an
angel
sir
an
angel
how
dare
you
bring
pollution
into
her
house
and
make
that
spotless
creature
wretched
with
the
thoughts
of
your
crime
sir
said
pen
do
deny
it
sir
roared
the
doctor
do
add
lies
sir
to
your
other
infamy
i
saw
you
myself
sir
i
saw
you
from
the
dean
garden
i
saw
you
kissing
the
hand
of
that
infernal
painted
stop
pen
said
clapping
his
fist
on
the
table
till
the
lamp
flickered
up
and
shook
i
am
a
very
young
man
but
you
will
please
to
remember
that
i
am
a
gentleman
i
will
hear
no
abuse
of
that
lady
sir
cried
the
doctor
that
a
lady
you
you
you
stand
in
your
mother
presence
and
call
that
that
woman
a
lady
in
anybody
presence
shouted
out
pen
she
is
worthy
of
any
place
she
is
as
pure
as
any
woman
she
is
as
good
as
she
is
beautiful
if
any
man
but
you
insulted
her
i
would
tell
him
what
i
thought
but
as
you
are
my
oldest
friend
i
suppose
you
have
the
privilege
to
doubt
of
my
no
no
pen
dearest
pen
cried
out
helen
in
an
excess
of
joy
i
told
i
told
you
doctor
he
was
not
not
what
you
thought
and
the
tender
creature
coming
trembling
forward
flung
herself
on
shoulder
pen
felt
himself
a
man
and
a
match
for
all
the
doctors
in
doctordom
he
was
glad
this
explanation
had
come
you
saw
how
beautiful
she
was
he
said
to
his
mother
with
a
soothing
protecting
air
like
hamlet
with
gertrude
in
the
play
i
tell
you
dear
mother
she
is
as
good
when
you
know
her
you
will
say
so
she
is
of
all
except
you
the
simplest
the
kindest
the
most
affectionate
of
women
why
should
she
not
be
on
the
stage
she
maintains
her
father
by
her
drunken
old
reprobate
growled
the
doctor
but
pen
did
not
hear
or
heed
if
you
could
see
as
i
have
how
orderly
her
life
is
how
pure
and
pious
her
whole
conduct
you
would
as
i
do
yes
as
i
do
with
a
savage
look
at
the
doctor
spurn
the
slanderer
who
dared
to
do
her
wrong
her
father
was
an
officer
and
distinguished
himself
in
spain
he
was
a
friend
of
his
royal
highness
the
duke
of
kent
and
is
intimately
known
to
the
duke
of
wellington
and
some
of
the
first
officers
of
our
army
he
has
met
my
uncle
arthur
at
lord
hill
he
thinks
his
own
family
is
one
of
the
most
ancient
and
respectable
in
ireland
and
indeed
is
as
good
as
our
own
the
costigans
were
kings
of
why
god
bless
my
soul
shrieked
out
the
doctor
hardly
knowing
whether
to
burst
with
rage
or
laughter
you
do
mean
to
say
you
want
to
marry
her
pen
put
on
his
most
princely
air
what
else
portman
he
said
do
you
suppose
would
be
my
desire
utterly
foiled
in
his
attack
and
knocked
down
by
this
sudden
lunge
of
pen
the
doctor
could
only
gasp
out
mrs
pendennis
send
for
the
send
for
the
major
with
all
my
heart
said
arthur
prince
of
pendennis
and
grand
duke
of
fairoaks
with
a
most
superb
wave
of
the
hand
and
the
colloquy
terminated
by
the
writing
of
those
two
letters
which
were
laid
on
major
pendennis
in
london
at
the
commencement
of
prince
arthur
most
veracious
history
chapter
vii
in
which
the
major
makes
his
appearance
our
acquaintance
major
arthur
pendennis
arrived
in
due
time
at
fairoaks
after
a
dreary
night
passed
in
the
where
a
stout
swelling
preternaturally
with
had
crowded
him
into
a
corner
and
kept
him
awake
by
snoring
indecently
where
a
widow
lady
opposite
had
not
only
shut
out
the
fresh
air
by
closing
all
the
windows
of
the
vehicle
but
had
filled
the
interior
with
fumes
of
jamaica
rum
and
water
which
she
sucked
perpetually
from
a
bottle
in
her
reticule
where
whenever
he
caught
a
brief
moment
of
sleep
the
twanging
of
the
horn
at
the
or
the
scuffling
of
his
huge
neighbour
wedging
him
closer
and
closer
or
the
play
of
the
feet
on
his
own
tender
toes
speedily
woke
up
the
poor
gentleman
to
the
horrors
and
realities
of
life
a
life
which
has
passed
away
now
and
become
impossible
and
only
lives
in
fond
memories
eight
miles
an
hour
for
twenty
or
hours
a
tight
a
hard
seat
a
gouty
tendency
a
perpetual
change
of
coachmen
grumbling
because
you
did
not
fee
them
enough
a
partial
to
who
has
not
borne
with
these
evils
in
the
jolly
old
times
and
how
could
people
travel
under
such
difficulties
and
yet
they
did
and
were
merry
too
next
the
widow
and
by
the
side
of
the
servant
on
the
roof
were
a
couple
of
going
home
for
the
midsummer
holidays
and
major
pendennis
wondered
to
see
them
sup
at
the
inn
at
bagshot
where
they
took
in
a
cargo
of
ham
eggs
pie
pickles
tea
coffee
and
boiled
beef
which
surprised
the
poor
major
sipping
a
cup
of
very
feeble
tea
and
thinking
with
a
tender
dejection
that
lord
steyne
dinner
was
coming
off
at
that
very
moment
the
ingenuous
ardour
of
the
boys
however
amused
the
major
who
was
very
and
he
became
the
more
interested
when
he
found
that
the
one
who
travelled
inside
with
him
was
a
lord
son
whose
noble
father
pendennis
of
course
had
met
in
the
world
of
fashion
which
he
frequented
the
little
lord
slept
all
night
through
in
spite
of
the
squeezing
and
the
and
the
widow
and
he
looked
as
fresh
as
paint
and
indeed
pronounced
himself
to
be
so
when
the
major
with
a
yellow
face
a
bristly
beard
a
wig
out
of
curl
and
strong
rheumatic
griefs
shooting
through
various
limbs
of
his
uneasy
body
descended
at
the
little
at
fairoaks
where
the
porteress
and
gardener
wife
reverentially
greeted
him
and
still
more
respectfully
morgan
his
man
helen
was
on
the
for
this
expected
guest
and
saw
him
from
her
window
but
she
did
not
come
forward
immediately
to
greet
him
she
knew
the
major
did
not
like
to
be
seen
at
a
surprise
and
required
a
little
preparation
before
he
cared
to
be
visible
pen
when
a
boy
had
incurred
sad
disgrace
by
carrying
off
from
the
major
a
little
morocco
box
which
it
must
be
confessed
contained
the
major
back
teeth
which
he
naturally
would
leave
out
of
his
jaws
in
a
jolting
and
without
which
he
would
not
choose
to
appear
morgan
his
man
made
a
mystery
of
mystery
of
his
wigs
curling
them
in
private
places
introducing
them
mysteriously
to
his
master
room
nor
without
his
head
of
hair
would
the
major
care
to
show
himself
to
any
member
of
his
family
or
any
acquaintance
he
went
to
his
apartment
then
and
supplied
these
deficiencies
he
groaned
and
moaned
and
wheezed
and
cursed
morgan
through
his
toilet
as
an
old
buck
will
who
has
been
up
all
night
with
a
rheumatism
and
has
a
long
duty
to
perform
and
finally
being
belted
curled
and
set
straight
he
descended
upon
the
with
a
grave
majestic
air
such
as
befitted
one
who
was
at
once
a
man
of
business
and
a
man
of
fashion
pen
was
not
there
however
only
helen
and
little
laura
sewing
at
her
knees
and
to
whom
he
never
presented
more
than
a
forefinger
as
he
did
on
this
occasion
after
saluting
his
laura
took
the
finger
trembling
and
dropped
it
and
then
fled
out
of
the
room
major
pendennis
did
not
want
to
keep
her
or
indeed
to
have
her
in
the
house
at
all
and
had
his
private
reason
for
disapproving
of
her
which
we
may
mention
on
some
future
occasion
meanwhile
laura
disappeared
and
wandered
about
the
premises
seeking
for
pen
whom
she
presently
found
in
the
orchard
pacing
up
and
down
a
walk
there
in
earnest
conversation
with
smirke
he
was
so
occupied
that
he
did
not
hear
laura
clear
voice
singing
out
until
smirke
pulled
him
by
the
coat
and
pointed
towards
her
as
she
came
running
she
ran
up
and
put
her
hand
into
his
come
in
pen
she
said
somebody
come
uncle
arthur
he
is
is
he
said
pen
and
she
felt
him
grasp
her
little
hand
he
looked
round
at
smirke
with
uncommon
fierceness
as
much
as
to
say
i
am
ready
for
him
or
any
mr
smirke
cast
up
his
eyes
as
usual
and
heaved
a
gentle
sigh
lead
on
laura
pen
said
with
a
half
fierce
half
comic
air
lead
on
and
say
i
wait
upon
my
but
he
was
laughing
in
order
to
hide
a
great
anxiety
and
was
screwing
his
courage
inwardly
to
face
the
ordeal
which
he
knew
was
now
before
him
pen
had
taken
smirke
into
his
confidence
in
the
last
two
days
and
after
the
outbreak
attendant
on
the
discovery
of
doctor
portman
and
during
every
one
of
those
hours
which
he
had
passed
in
smirke
society
had
done
nothing
but
talk
to
his
tutor
about
miss
fotheringay
miss
emily
fotheringay
emily
to
all
which
talk
smirke
listened
without
difficulty
for
he
was
in
love
himself
most
anxious
in
all
things
to
propitiate
pen
and
indeed
very
much
himself
enraptured
by
the
personal
charms
of
this
goddess
whose
like
never
having
been
before
at
a
theatrical
representation
he
had
not
beheld
until
now
pen
fire
and
volubility
his
hot
eloquence
and
rich
poetical
tropes
and
figures
his
manly
heart
kind
ardent
and
hopeful
refusing
to
see
any
defects
in
the
person
he
loved
any
difficulties
in
their
position
that
he
might
not
overcome
had
half
convinced
smirke
that
the
arrangement
proposed
by
mr
pen
was
a
very
feasible
and
prudent
one
and
that
it
would
be
a
great
comfort
to
have
emily
settled
at
fairoaks
captain
costigan
in
the
yellow
room
established
for
life
there
and
pen
married
at
eighteen
and
it
is
a
fact
that
in
these
two
days
the
boy
had
almost
talked
over
his
mother
too
had
parried
all
her
objections
one
after
another
with
that
indignant
good
sense
which
is
often
the
perfection
of
absurdity
and
had
brought
her
almost
to
acquiesce
in
the
belief
that
if
the
marriage
was
doomed
in
heaven
why
doomed
it
was
that
if
the
young
woman
was
a
good
person
it
was
all
that
she
for
her
part
had
to
ask
and
rather
to
dread
the
arrival
of
the
guardian
uncle
who
she
foresaw
would
regard
mr
pen
marriage
in
a
manner
very
different
to
that
simple
romantic
honest
and
utterly
absurd
way
in
which
the
widow
was
already
disposed
to
look
at
questions
of
this
sort
for
as
in
the
old
allegory
of
the
gold
and
silver
shield
about
which
the
two
knights
quarrelled
each
is
right
according
to
the
point
from
which
he
looks
so
about
marriage
the
question
whether
it
is
foolish
or
good
wise
or
otherwise
depends
upon
the
point
of
view
from
which
you
regard
it
if
it
means
a
snug
house
in
belgravia
and
pretty
little
and
a
pretty
little
brougham
to
drive
in
the
park
and
a
decent
provision
not
only
for
the
young
people
but
for
the
little
belgravians
to
come
and
if
these
are
the
necessaries
of
life
and
they
are
with
many
honest
people
to
talk
of
any
other
arrangement
is
an
absurdity
of
love
in
lodgings
a
babyish
folly
of
affection
that
pay
or
afford
a
decent
milliner
as
mere
wicked
balderdash
and
childish
romance
if
on
the
other
hand
your
opinion
is
that
people
not
with
an
assured
subsistence
but
with
a
fair
chance
to
obtain
it
and
with
the
stimulus
of
hope
health
and
strong
affection
may
take
the
chance
of
fortune
for
better
or
worse
and
share
its
good
or
its
evil
together
the
polite
theory
then
becomes
an
absurdity
in
its
turn
worse
than
an
absurdity
a
blasphemy
almost
and
doubt
of
providence
and
a
man
who
waits
to
make
his
chosen
woman
happy
until
he
can
drive
her
to
church
in
a
neat
little
carriage
with
a
pair
of
horses
is
no
better
than
a
coward
or
a
trifler
who
is
neither
worthy
of
love
nor
of
fortune
i
do
say
that
the
town
folks
are
not
right
but
helen
pendennis
was
a
woman
and
the
book
of
life
as
she
interpreted
it
told
her
a
different
story
to
that
page
which
is
read
in
cities
like
most
soft
and
sentimental
women
matchmaking
in
general
formed
a
great
part
of
her
thoughts
and
i
daresay
she
had
begun
to
speculate
about
her
son
falling
in
love
and
marrying
long
before
the
subject
had
ever
entered
into
the
brains
of
the
young
gentleman
it
pleased
her
with
that
dismal
pleasure
which
the
idea
of
sacrificing
themselves
gives
to
certain
women
to
think
of
the
day
when
she
would
give
up
all
to
pen
and
he
should
bring
his
wife
home
and
she
would
surrender
the
keys
and
the
best
bedroom
and
go
and
sit
at
the
side
of
the
table
and
see
him
happy
what
did
she
want
in
life
but
to
see
the
lad
prosper
as
an
empress
certainly
was
not
too
good
for
him
and
would
be
honoured
by
becoming
mrs
pen
so
if
he
selected
humble
esther
instead
of
queen
vashti
she
would
be
content
with
his
lordship
choice
never
mind
how
lowly
or
poor
the
person
might
be
who
was
to
enjoy
that
prodigious
honour
pendennis
was
willing
to
bow
before
her
and
welcome
her
and
yield
her
up
the
first
place
but
an
actress
a
mature
woman
who
had
long
ceased
blushing
except
with
rouge
as
she
stood
under
the
eager
glances
of
thousands
of
eyes
an
illiterate
and
person
very
likely
who
must
have
lived
with
light
associates
and
have
heard
doubtful
conversation
oh
it
was
hard
that
such
a
one
should
be
chosen
and
that
the
matron
should
be
deposed
to
give
place
to
such
a
sultana
all
these
doubts
the
widow
laid
before
pen
during
the
two
days
which
had
of
necessity
to
elapse
ere
the
uncle
came
down
but
he
met
them
with
that
happy
frankness
and
ease
which
a
young
gentleman
exhibits
at
his
time
of
life
and
routed
his
mother
objections
with
infinite
satisfaction
to
himself
miss
costigan
was
a
paragon
of
virtue
and
delicacy
she
was
as
sensitive
as
the
most
timid
maiden
she
was
as
pure
as
the
unsullied
snow
she
had
the
finest
manners
the
most
graceful
wit
and
genius
the
most
charming
refinement
and
justness
of
appreciation
in
all
matters
of
taste
she
had
the
most
admirable
temper
and
devotion
to
her
father
a
good
old
gentleman
of
high
family
and
fallen
fortunes
who
had
lived
however
with
the
best
society
in
europe
he
was
in
no
hurry
and
could
afford
to
wait
any
time
till
he
was
but
he
felt
and
here
his
face
assumed
an
awful
and
harrowing
solemnity
that
he
was
engaged
in
the
one
only
passion
of
his
life
and
that
death
alone
could
close
it
helen
told
him
with
a
sad
smile
and
shake
of
the
head
that
people
survived
these
passions
and
as
for
long
engagements
contracted
between
very
young
men
and
old
women
she
knew
an
instance
in
her
own
family
laura
poor
father
was
an
instance
how
fatal
they
were
mr
pen
however
was
resolved
that
death
must
be
his
doom
in
case
of
disappointment
and
rather
than
this
rather
than
baulk
him
in
fact
this
lady
would
have
submitted
to
any
sacrifice
or
personal
pain
and
would
have
gone
down
on
her
knees
and
have
kissed
the
feet
of
a
hottentot
arthur
knew
his
power
over
the
widow
and
the
young
tyrant
was
touched
whilst
he
exercised
it
in
those
two
days
he
brought
her
almost
into
submission
and
patronised
her
very
kindly
and
he
passed
one
evening
with
the
lovely
at
chatteris
in
which
he
bragged
of
his
influence
over
his
mother
and
he
spent
the
other
night
in
composing
a
most
flaming
and
conceited
copy
of
verses
to
his
divinity
in
which
he
vowed
like
montrose
that
he
would
make
her
famous
with
his
sword
and
glorious
by
his
pen
and
that
he
would
love
her
as
no
mortal
woman
had
been
adored
since
the
creation
of
womankind
it
was
on
that
night
long
after
midnight
that
wakeful
helen
passing
stealthily
by
her
son
door
saw
a
light
streaming
through
the
chink
of
the
door
into
the
dark
passage
and
heard
pen
tossing
and
tumbling
and
mumbling
verses
in
his
bed
she
waited
outside
for
a
while
anxiously
listening
to
him
in
infantile
fevers
and
early
boyish
illnesses
many
a
night
before
the
kind
soul
had
so
kept
watch
she
turned
the
lock
very
softly
now
and
went
in
so
gently
that
pen
for
a
moment
did
not
see
her
his
face
was
turned
from
her
his
papers
on
his
desk
were
scattered
about
and
more
were
lying
on
the
bed
round
him
he
was
biting
a
pencil
and
thinking
of
rhymes
and
all
sorts
of
follies
and
passions
he
was
hamlet
jumping
into
ophelia
grave
he
was
the
stranger
taking
haller
to
his
arms
beautiful
haller
with
the
raven
ringlets
falling
over
her
shoulders
despair
and
byron
thomas
moore
and
all
the
loves
of
the
angels
waller
and
herrick
beranger
and
all
the
he
had
ever
read
were
working
and
seething
in
this
young
mind
and
he
was
at
the
very
height
and
paroxysm
of
the
imaginative
frenzy
when
his
mother
found
him
arthur
said
the
mother
soft
silver
voice
and
he
started
up
and
turned
round
he
clutched
some
of
the
papers
and
pushed
them
under
the
pillow
why
do
you
go
to
sleep
my
dear
she
said
with
a
sweet
tender
smile
and
sate
down
on
the
bed
and
took
one
of
his
hot
hands
pen
looked
at
her
wildly
for
an
instant
i
could
sleep
he
said
i
i
was
i
was
and
hereupon
he
flung
his
arms
round
her
neck
and
said
o
mother
i
love
her
i
love
her
how
could
such
a
kind
soul
as
that
help
soothing
and
pitying
him
the
gentle
creature
did
her
best
and
thought
with
a
strange
wonderment
and
tenderness
that
it
was
only
yesterday
that
he
was
a
child
in
that
bed
and
how
she
used
to
come
and
say
her
prayers
over
it
before
he
woke
upon
holiday
mornings
they
were
very
grand
verses
no
doubt
although
miss
fotheringay
did
not
understand
them
but
old
cos
with
a
wink
and
a
knowing
finger
on
his
nose
said
put
them
up
with
th
other
letthers
milly
darling
poldoody
pomes
was
nothing
to
so
milly
locked
up
the
manuscripts
when
then
the
major
being
dressed
and
presentable
presented
himself
to
pendennis
he
found
in
the
course
of
ten
minutes
colloquy
that
the
poor
widow
was
not
merely
distressed
at
the
idea
of
the
marriage
contemplated
by
pen
but
actually
more
distressed
at
thinking
that
the
boy
himself
was
unhappy
about
it
and
that
his
uncle
and
he
should
have
any
violent
altercation
on
the
subject
she
besought
major
pendennis
to
be
very
gentle
with
arthur
he
has
a
very
high
spirit
and
will
not
brook
unkind
words
she
hinted
dr
portman
spoke
to
him
rather
roughly
and
i
must
own
unjustly
the
other
night
for
my
dearest
honour
is
as
high
as
any
mother
can
desire
but
pen
answer
quite
frightened
me
it
was
so
indignant
recollect
he
is
a
man
now
and
be
very
very
cautious
said
the
widow
laying
a
fair
long
hand
on
the
major
sleeve
he
took
it
up
kissed
it
gallantly
and
looked
in
her
alarmed
face
with
wonder
and
a
scorn
which
he
was
too
polite
to
show
bon
dieu
thought
the
old
negotiator
the
boy
has
actually
talked
the
woman
round
and
she
get
him
a
wife
as
she
would
a
toy
if
master
cried
for
it
why
are
there
no
such
things
as
and
a
bastille
for
young
fellows
of
family
the
major
lived
in
such
good
company
that
he
might
be
excused
for
feeling
like
an
he
kissed
the
widow
timid
hand
pressed
it
in
both
his
and
laid
it
down
on
the
table
with
one
of
his
own
over
it
as
he
smiled
and
looked
her
in
the
face
confess
said
he
now
that
you
are
thinking
how
you
possibly
can
make
it
up
to
your
conscience
to
let
the
boy
have
his
own
she
blushed
and
was
moved
in
the
usual
manner
of
females
i
am
thinking
that
he
is
very
unhappy
and
i
am
too
to
contradict
him
or
to
let
him
have
his
own
wish
asked
the
other
and
added
with
great
comfort
to
his
inward
self
i
d
d
if
he
to
think
that
he
should
have
formed
so
foolish
and
cruel
and
fatal
an
attachment
the
widow
said
which
can
but
end
in
pain
whatever
be
the
the
issue
sha
be
marriage
my
dear
sister
the
major
said
resolutely
we
not
going
to
have
a
pendennis
the
head
of
the
house
marry
a
strolling
mountebank
from
a
booth
no
no
we
wo
marry
into
greenwich
fair
if
the
match
is
broken
suddenly
off
the
widow
interposed
i
know
what
may
be
the
consequence
i
know
arthur
ardent
temper
the
intensity
of
his
affections
the
agony
of
his
pleasures
and
disappointments
and
i
tremble
at
this
one
if
it
must
be
indeed
indeed
it
must
not
come
on
him
too
my
dear
madam
the
major
said
with
an
air
of
the
deepest
commiseration
i
no
doubt
arthur
will
have
to
suffer
confoundedly
before
he
gets
over
the
little
disappointment
but
is
he
think
you
the
only
person
who
has
been
so
rendered
miserable
no
indeed
said
helen
holding
down
her
eyes
she
was
thinking
of
her
own
case
and
was
at
that
moment
seventeen
again
and
most
miserable
i
myself
whispered
her
have
undergone
a
disappointment
in
early
life
a
young
woman
with
fifteen
thousand
pounds
niece
to
an
earl
most
accomplished
creature
a
third
of
her
money
would
have
run
up
my
promotion
in
no
time
and
i
should
have
been
a
lieutenant
colonel
at
thirty
but
it
might
not
be
i
was
but
a
penniless
lieutenant
her
parents
interfered
and
i
embarked
for
india
where
i
had
the
honour
of
being
secretary
to
lord
buckley
when
without
her
what
happened
we
returned
our
letters
sent
back
our
locks
of
hair
the
major
here
passed
his
fingers
through
his
wig
we
suffered
but
we
recovered
she
is
now
a
baronet
wife
with
thirteen
children
altered
it
is
true
in
person
but
her
daughters
remind
me
of
what
she
was
and
the
third
is
to
be
presented
early
next
helen
did
not
answer
she
was
still
thinking
of
old
times
i
suppose
if
one
lives
to
be
a
hundred
there
are
certain
passages
of
one
early
life
whereof
the
recollection
will
always
carry
us
back
to
youth
again
and
that
helen
was
thinking
of
one
of
these
look
at
my
own
brother
my
dear
creature
the
major
continued
gallantly
he
himself
you
know
had
a
little
disappointment
when
he
started
in
the
the
medical
profession
an
eligible
opportunity
presented
itself
miss
balls
i
remember
the
name
was
daughter
of
an
apoth
a
practitioner
in
very
large
practice
my
brother
had
very
nearly
succeeded
in
his
but
difficulties
arose
disappointments
supervened
and
and
i
am
sure
he
had
no
reason
to
regret
the
disappointment
which
gave
him
this
hand
said
the
major
and
he
once
more
politely
pressed
helen
fingers
those
marriages
between
people
of
such
different
rank
and
age
said
helen
are
sad
things
i
have
known
them
produce
a
great
deal
of
laura
father
my
cousin
who
who
was
brought
up
with
me
she
added
in
a
low
voice
was
an
instance
of
most
injudicious
cut
in
the
major
i
do
know
anything
more
painful
than
for
a
man
to
marry
his
superior
in
age
or
his
inferior
in
station
fancy
marrying
a
woman
of
low
rank
of
life
and
having
your
house
filled
with
her
confounded
of
relations
fancy
your
wife
attached
to
a
mother
who
dropped
her
h
or
called
maria
marire
how
are
you
to
introduce
her
into
society
my
dear
pendennis
i
will
name
no
names
but
in
the
very
best
circles
of
london
society
i
have
seen
men
suffering
the
most
excruciating
agony
i
have
known
them
to
be
cut
to
be
lost
utterly
from
the
vulgarity
of
their
wives
connections
what
did
lady
snapperton
do
last
year
at
her
dejeune
dansant
after
the
bohemian
ball
she
told
lord
brouncker
that
he
might
bring
his
daughters
or
send
them
with
a
proper
chaperon
but
that
she
would
not
receive
lady
brouncker
who
was
a
druggist
daughter
or
some
such
thing
and
as
tom
wagg
remarked
of
her
never
wanted
medicine
certainly
for
she
never
had
an
h
in
her
life
good
ged
what
would
have
been
the
trifling
pang
of
a
separation
in
the
first
instance
to
the
enduring
infliction
of
a
constant
misalliance
and
intercourse
with
low
people
what
indeed
said
helen
dimly
disposed
towards
laughter
but
yet
checking
the
inclination
because
she
remembered
in
what
prodigious
respect
her
deceased
husband
held
major
pendennis
and
his
stories
of
the
great
world
then
this
fatal
woman
is
ten
years
older
than
that
silly
young
scapegrace
of
an
arthur
what
happens
in
such
cases
my
dear
creature
i
do
mind
telling
you
now
we
are
alone
that
in
the
highest
state
of
society
misery
undeviating
misery
is
the
result
look
at
lord
clodworthy
come
into
a
room
with
his
wife
why
good
ged
she
looks
like
clodworthy
mother
what
the
case
between
lord
and
lady
willowbank
whose
love
match
was
notorious
he
has
already
cut
her
down
twice
when
she
has
hanged
herself
out
of
jealousy
for
mademoiselle
de
sainte
cunegonde
the
dancer
and
mark
my
words
good
ged
one
day
he
not
cut
the
old
woman
down
no
my
dear
madam
you
are
not
in
the
world
but
i
am
you
are
a
little
romantic
and
sentimental
you
know
you
are
women
with
those
large
beautiful
eyes
always
are
you
must
leave
this
matter
to
my
experience
marry
this
woman
marry
at
eighteen
an
actress
of
thirty
bah
bah
i
would
as
soon
he
sent
into
the
kitchen
and
married
the
i
know
the
evils
of
premature
engagements
sighed
out
helen
and
as
she
has
made
this
allusion
no
less
than
thrice
in
the
course
of
the
above
conversation
and
seems
to
be
so
oppressed
with
the
notion
of
long
engagements
and
unequal
marriages
and
as
the
circumstance
we
have
to
relate
will
explain
what
perhaps
some
persons
are
anxious
to
know
namely
who
little
laura
is
who
has
appeared
more
than
once
before
us
it
will
be
as
well
to
clear
up
these
points
in
another
chapter
chapter
viii
in
which
pen
is
kept
waiting
at
the
door
while
the
reader
is
informed
who
little
laura
was
once
upon
a
time
then
there
was
a
young
gentleman
of
cambridge
university
who
came
to
pass
the
long
vacation
at
the
village
where
young
helen
thistlewood
was
living
with
her
mother
the
widow
of
the
lieutenant
slain
at
copenhagen
this
gentleman
whose
name
was
the
reverend
francis
bell
was
nephew
to
thistlewood
and
by
consequence
own
cousin
to
miss
helen
so
that
it
was
very
right
that
he
should
take
lodgings
in
his
aunt
house
who
lived
in
a
very
small
way
and
there
he
passed
the
long
vacation
reading
with
three
or
four
pupils
who
accompanied
him
to
the
village
bell
was
fellow
of
a
college
and
famous
in
the
university
for
his
learning
and
skill
as
a
tutor
his
two
kinswomen
understood
pretty
early
that
the
reverend
gentleman
was
engaged
to
be
married
and
was
only
waiting
for
a
college
living
to
enable
him
to
fulfil
his
engagement
his
intended
bride
was
the
daughter
of
another
parson
who
had
acted
as
bell
own
private
tutor
in
bell
early
life
and
it
was
whilst
under
coacher
roof
indeed
and
when
only
a
boy
of
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
of
age
that
the
impetuous
young
bell
had
flung
himself
at
the
feet
of
miss
martha
coacher
whom
he
was
helping
to
pick
peas
in
the
garden
on
his
knees
before
those
peas
and
her
he
pledged
himself
to
an
endless
affection
miss
coacher
was
by
many
years
the
young
fellow
senior
and
her
own
heart
had
been
lacerated
by
many
previous
disappointments
in
the
matrimonial
line
no
less
than
three
pupils
of
her
father
had
trifled
with
those
young
affections
the
apothecary
of
the
village
had
despicably
jilted
her
the
dragoon
officer
with
whom
she
had
danced
so
many
many
times
during
that
happy
season
which
she
passed
at
bath
with
her
gouty
grandmamma
one
day
gaily
shook
his
and
galloped
away
never
to
return
wounded
by
the
shafts
of
repeated
ingratitude
can
it
be
wondered
at
that
the
heart
of
martha
coacher
should
pant
to
find
rest
somewhere
she
listened
to
the
proposals
of
the
gawky
gallant
honest
boy
with
great
kindness
and
at
the
end
of
his
speech
she
said
law
bell
i
sure
you
are
too
young
to
think
of
such
things
but
intimated
that
she
too
would
revolve
them
in
her
own
virgin
bosom
she
could
not
refer
bell
to
her
mamma
for
coacher
was
a
widower
and
being
immersed
in
his
books
was
of
course
unable
to
take
the
direction
of
so
frail
and
wondrous
an
article
as
a
lady
heart
which
miss
martha
had
to
manage
for
herself
a
lock
of
her
hair
tied
up
in
a
piece
of
blue
ribbon
conveyed
to
the
happy
bell
the
result
of
the
vestal
conference
with
herself
thrice
before
had
she
snipt
off
one
of
her
auburn
ringlets
and
given
them
away
the
possessors
were
faithless
but
the
hair
had
grown
again
and
martha
had
indeed
occasion
to
say
that
men
were
deceivers
when
she
handed
over
this
token
of
love
to
the
simple
boy
number
however
was
an
exception
to
former
passions
francis
bell
was
the
most
faithful
of
lovers
when
his
time
arrived
to
go
to
college
and
it
became
necessary
to
acquaint
coacher
of
the
arrangements
that
had
been
made
the
latter
cried
god
bless
my
soul
i
had
the
least
idea
what
was
going
on
as
was
indeed
very
likely
for
he
had
been
taken
in
three
times
before
in
precisely
a
similar
manner
and
francis
went
to
the
university
resolved
to
conquer
honours
so
as
to
be
able
to
lay
them
at
the
feet
of
his
beloved
martha
this
prize
in
view
made
him
labour
prodigiously
news
came
term
after
term
of
the
honours
he
won
he
sent
the
for
his
college
essays
to
old
coacher
and
his
silver
declamation
cup
to
miss
martha
in
due
season
he
was
high
among
the
wranglers
and
a
fellow
of
his
college
and
during
all
the
time
of
these
transactions
a
constant
tender
correspondence
was
kept
up
with
miss
coacher
to
whose
influence
and
perhaps
with
justice
he
attributed
the
successes
which
he
had
won
by
the
time
however
when
the
rev
francis
bell
and
fellow
and
tutor
of
his
college
was
years
of
age
it
happened
that
miss
coacher
was
nor
had
her
charms
her
manners
or
her
temper
improved
since
that
sunny
day
in
the
springtime
of
life
when
he
found
her
picking
peas
in
the
garden
having
achieved
his
honours
he
relaxed
in
the
ardour
of
his
studies
and
his
judgment
and
tastes
also
perhaps
became
cooler
the
sunshine
of
the
faded
away
from
miss
martha
and
poor
bell
found
himself
engaged
and
his
hand
pledged
to
that
bond
in
a
thousand
letters
to
a
coarse
woman
it
was
in
consequence
of
one
of
many
altercations
in
which
eloquence
shone
and
in
which
therefore
she
was
frequently
pleased
to
indulge
that
francis
refused
to
take
his
pupils
to
bearleader
green
where
coacher
living
was
and
where
bell
was
in
the
habit
of
spending
the
summer
and
he
bethought
him
that
he
would
pass
the
vacation
at
his
aunt
village
which
he
had
not
seen
for
many
years
not
since
little
helen
was
a
girl
and
used
to
sit
on
his
knee
down
then
he
came
and
lived
with
them
helen
was
grown
a
beautiful
young
woman
now
the
cousins
were
nearly
four
months
together
from
june
to
october
they
walked
in
the
summer
evenings
they
met
in
the
early
morn
they
read
out
of
the
same
book
when
the
old
lady
dozed
at
night
over
the
candles
what
little
helen
knew
frank
taught
her
she
sang
to
him
she
gave
her
artless
heart
to
him
she
was
aware
of
all
his
story
had
he
made
any
secret
had
he
not
shown
the
picture
of
the
woman
to
whom
he
was
engaged
and
with
a
blush
her
letters
hard
eager
and
cruel
the
days
went
on
and
on
happier
and
closer
with
more
kindness
more
confidence
and
more
pity
at
last
one
morning
in
october
came
when
francis
went
back
to
college
and
the
poor
girl
felt
that
her
tender
heart
was
gone
with
him
frank
too
wakened
up
from
the
delightful
midsummer
dream
to
the
horrible
reality
of
his
own
pain
he
gnashed
and
tore
at
the
chain
which
bound
him
he
was
frantic
to
break
it
and
be
free
should
he
confess
give
his
savings
to
the
woman
to
whom
he
was
bound
and
beg
his
release
there
was
time
yet
he
temporised
no
living
might
fall
in
for
years
to
come
the
cousins
went
on
corresponding
sadly
and
fondly
the
betrothed
woman
hard
jealous
and
dissatisfied
complaining
bitterly
and
with
reason
of
her
francis
altered
tone
at
last
things
came
to
a
crisis
and
the
new
attachment
was
discovered
francis
owned
it
cared
not
to
disguise
it
rebuked
martha
with
her
violent
temper
and
angry
imperiousness
and
worst
of
all
with
her
inferiority
and
her
age
her
reply
was
that
if
he
did
not
keep
his
promise
she
would
carry
his
letters
into
every
court
in
the
kingdom
letters
in
which
his
love
was
pledged
to
her
ten
thousand
times
and
after
exposing
him
to
the
world
as
the
perjurer
and
traitor
he
was
she
would
kill
herself
frank
had
one
more
interview
with
helen
whose
mother
was
dead
then
and
who
was
living
companion
with
old
lady
pontypool
one
more
interview
where
it
was
resolved
that
he
was
to
do
his
duty
that
is
to
redeem
his
vow
that
is
to
pay
a
debt
cozened
from
him
by
a
sharper
that
is
to
make
two
honest
people
miserable
so
the
two
judged
their
duty
to
be
and
they
parted
the
living
fell
in
only
too
soon
but
yet
frank
bell
was
quite
a
grey
and
man
when
he
was
inducted
into
it
helen
wrote
him
a
letter
on
his
marriage
beginning
my
dear
cousin
and
ending
always
truly
she
sent
him
back
the
other
letters
and
the
lock
of
his
hair
all
but
a
small
piece
she
had
it
in
her
desk
when
she
was
talking
to
the
major
bell
lived
for
three
or
four
years
in
his
living
at
the
end
of
which
time
the
chaplainship
of
coventry
island
falling
vacant
frank
applied
for
it
privately
and
having
procured
it
announced
the
appointment
to
his
wife
she
objected
as
she
did
to
everything
he
told
her
bitterly
that
he
did
not
want
her
to
come
so
she
went
bell
went
out
in
governor
crawley
time
and
was
very
intimate
with
that
gentleman
in
his
later
years
and
it
was
in
coventry
island
years
after
his
own
marriage
and
five
years
after
he
had
heard
of
the
birth
of
helen
boy
that
his
own
daughter
was
born
she
was
not
the
daughter
of
the
first
bell
who
died
of
island
fever
very
soon
after
helen
pendennis
and
her
husband
to
whom
helen
had
told
everything
wrote
to
inform
bell
of
the
birth
of
their
child

was
old

said
bell
the
first
i
was
old
and
her
inferior
was
i
but
i
married
you
bell
and
kept
you
from
marrying
her
and
hereupon
she
died
bell
married
a
colonial
lady
whom
he
loved
fondly
but
he
was
not
doomed
to
prosper
in
love
and
this
lady
dying
in
childbirth
bell
gave
up
too
sending
his
little
girl
home
to
helen
pendennis
and
her
husband
with
a
parting
prayer
that
they
would
befriend
her
the
little
thing

to
fairoaks
from
bristol
which

not
very
far
off
dressed
in
black
and
in
company
of
a
soldier
wife
her
nurse
at
parting
from
whom
she
wept
bitterly
but
she
soon
dried
up
her
grief
under
helen
motherly
care
round
her
neck
she
had
a
locket
with
hair
which
helen
had
given

how
many
years
ago
to
poor
francis

and

child

all
that
was
left
of
him

though
he
accepted
the
trust
was
always
rather
jealous
of
the
orphan
and
gloomily
ordered
that
she
should
be
called
by
her
own
mother
name
and
not
by
that
first
one
which
her
father
had
given
her
she
was
afraid
of
pendennis
to
the
last
moment
of
his
life
and
it
was
only
when
her
husband
was
gone
that
helen
dared
openly
to
indulge
in
the
tenderness
which
she
felt
for
the
little
girl
thus
it
was
that
laura
bell
became
pendennis
daughter
neither
her
husband
nor
that
gentleman
brother
the
major
viewed
her
with
very
favourable
eyes
she
reminded
the
first
of
circumstances
in
his
wife
life
which
he
was
forced
to
accept
but
would
have
forgotten
much
more
willingly
and
as
for
the
second
how
could
he
regard
her
she
was
neither
related
to
his
own
family
of
pendennis
nor
to
any
nobleman
in
this
empire
and
she
had
but
a
couple
of
thousand
pounds
for
her
fortune
and
now
let
mr
pen
come
in
who
has
been
waiting
all
this
while
having
strung
up
his
nerves
and
prepared
himself
without
at
the
door
for
the
meeting
he
came
to
it
determined
to
face
the
awful
uncle
he
had
settled
in
his
mind
that
the
encounter
was
to
be
a
fierce
one
and
was
resolved
on
bearing
it
through
with
all
the
courage
and
dignity
of
the
famous
family
which
he
represented
and
he
flung
open
the
door
and
entered
with
the
most
severe
and
warlike
expression
armed
as
it
were
with
lance
couched
and
plumes
displayed
and
glancing
at
his
adversary
as
if
to
say
come
on
i
the
old
man
of
the
world
as
he
surveyed
the
boy
demeanour
could
hardly
help
a
grin
at
his
admirable
pompous
simplicity
major
pendennis
too
had
examined
his
ground
and
finding
that
the
widow
was
already
half
won
over
to
the
enemy
and
having
a
shrewd
notion
that
threats
and
tragic
exhortations
would
have
no
effect
upon
the
boy
who
was
inclined
to
be
perfectly
stubborn
and
awfully
serious
the
major
laid
aside
the
authoritative
manner
at
once
and
with
the
most
natural
smile
in
the
world
held
out
his
hands
to
pen
shook
the
lad
passive
fingers
gaily
and
said
well
pen
my
boy
tell
us
all
about
helen
was
delighted
with
the
generosity
of
the
major
on
the
contrary
it
quite
took
aback
and
disappointed
poor
pen
whose
nerves
were
strung
up
for
a
tragedy
and
who
felt
that
his
grand
entree
was
altogether
baulked
and
ludicrous
he
blushed
and
winced
with
mortified
vanity
and
bewilderment
he
felt
immensely
inclined
to
begin
to
cry
i
i
i
did
know
that
you
were
come
till
just
now
he
said
is
is
town
very
full
i
suppose
if
pen
could
hardly
gulp
his
tears
down
it
was
all
the
major
could
do
to
keep
from
laughter
he
turned
round
and
shot
a
comical
glance
at
pendennis
who
too
felt
that
the
scene
was
at
once
ridiculous
and
sentimental
and
so
having
nothing
to
say
she
went
up
and
kissed
mr
pen
as
he
thought
of
her
tenderness
and
soft
obedience
to
his
wishes
it
is
very
possible
too
the
boy
was
melted
what
a
couple
of
fools
they
are
thought
the
old
guardian
if
i
had
come
down
she
would
have
driven
over
in
state
to
pay
a
visit
and
give
her
blessing
to
the
young
lady
come
come
said
he
still
grinning
at
the
couple
let
us
have
as
little
sentiment
as
possible
and
pen
my
good
fellow
tell
us
the
whole
pen
got
back
at
once
to
his
tragic
and
heroical
air
the
story
is
sir
said
he
as
i
have
written
it
to
you
before
i
have
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
most
beautiful
and
most
virtuous
lady
of
a
high
family
although
in
reduced
circumstances
i
have
found
the
woman
in
whom
i
know
that
the
happiness
of
my
life
is
centred
i
feel
that
i
never
never
can
think
about
any
woman
but
her
i
am
aware
of
the
difference
of
our
ages
and
other
difficulties
in
my
way
but
my
affection
was
so
great
that
i
felt
i
could
surmount
all
these
that
we
both
could
and
she
has
consented
to
unite
her
lot
with
mine
and
to
accept
my
heart
and
my
how
much
is
that
my
boy
said
the
major
has
anybody
left
you
some
money
i
do
know
that
you
are
worth
a
shilling
in
the
you
know
what
i
have
is
his
cried
out
pendennis
good
heavens
madam
hold
your
tongue
was
what
the
guardian
was
disposed
to
say
but
he
kept
his
temper
not
without
a
struggle
no
doubt
no
doubt
he
said
you
would
sacrifice
anything
for
him
everybody
knows
that
but
it
is
after
all
then
your
fortune
which
pen
is
offering
to
the
young
lady
and
of
which
he
wishes
to
take
possession
at
i
know
my
mother
will
give
me
anything
pen
said
looking
rather
disturbed
yes
my
good
fellow
but
there
is
reason
in
all
things
if
your
mother
keeps
the
house
it
is
but
fair
that
she
should
select
her
company
when
you
give
her
house
over
her
head
and
transfer
her
banker
account
to
yourself
for
the
benefit
of
miss
miss
costigan
do
you
think
you
should
at
least
have
consulted
my
sister
as
one
of
the
principal
parties
in
the
transaction
i
am
speaking
to
you
you
see
without
the
least
anger
or
assumption
of
authority
such
as
the
law
and
your
father
will
give
me
over
you
for
three
years
to
come
but
as
one
man
of
the
world
to
another
and
i
ask
you
if
you
think
that
because
you
can
do
what
you
like
with
your
mother
therefore
you
have
a
right
to
do
so
as
you
are
her
dependent
would
it
not
have
been
more
generous
to
wait
before
you
took
this
step
and
at
least
to
have
paid
her
the
courtesy
to
ask
her
leave
pen
held
down
his
head
and
began
dimly
to
perceive
that
the
action
on
which
he
had
prided
himself
as
a
most
romantic
generous
instance
of
disinterested
affection
was
perhaps
a
very
selfish
and
headstrong
piece
of
folly
i
did
it
in
a
moment
of
passion
said
pen
floundering
i
was
not
aware
what
i
was
going
to
say
or
to
do
and
in
this
he
spoke
with
perfect
sincerity
but
now
it
is
said
and
i
stand
to
it
no
i
neither
can
nor
will
recall
it
i
die
rather
than
do
so
and
i
i
do
want
to
burthen
my
mother
he
continued
i
work
for
myself
i
go
on
the
stage
and
act
with
her
she
she
says
i
should
do
well
but
will
she
take
you
on
those
terms
the
major
interposed
mind
i
do
not
say
that
miss
costigan
is
not
the
most
disinterested
of
women
but
do
you
suppose
now
fairly
that
your
position
as
a
young
gentleman
of
ancient
birth
and
decent
expectations
forms
a
part
of
the
cause
why
she
finds
your
addresses
welcome
i
die
i
say
rather
than
forfeit
my
pledge
to
her
said
pen
doubling
his
fists
and
turning
red
who
asks
you
my
dear
friend
answered
the
imperturbable
guardian
no
gentleman
breaks
his
word
of
course
when
it
has
been
given
freely
but
after
all
you
can
wait
you
owe
something
to
your
mother
something
to
your
family
something
to
me
as
your
father
oh
of
course
pen
said
feeling
rather
relieved
well
as
you
have
pledged
your
word
to
her
give
us
another
will
you
arthur
what
is
it
arthur
asked
that
you
will
make
no
private
marriage
that
you
wo
be
taking
a
trip
to
scotland
you
that
would
be
a
falsehood
pen
never
told
his
mother
a
falsehood
helen
said
pen
hung
down
his
head
again
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
of
shame
had
not
this
whole
intrigue
been
a
falsehood
to
that
tender
and
confiding
creature
who
was
ready
to
give
up
all
for
his
sake
he
gave
his
uncle
his
hand
no
sir
on
my
word
of
honour
as
a
gentleman
he
said
i
will
never
marry
without
my
mother
consent
and
giving
helen
a
bright
parting
look
of
confidence
and
affection
unchangeable
the
boy
went
out
of
the
into
his
own
study
he
an
angel
he
an
angel
the
mother
cried
out
in
one
of
her
usual
raptures
he
comes
of
a
good
stock
said
her
of
a
good
stock
on
both
the
major
was
greatly
pleased
with
the
result
of
his
diplomacy
so
much
so
that
he
once
more
saluted
the
tips
of
pendennis
glove
and
dropping
the
curt
manly
and
straightforward
tone
in
which
he
had
conducted
the
conversation
with
the
lad
assumed
a
certain
drawl
which
he
always
adopted
when
he
was
most
conceited
and
fine
my
dear
creature
said
he
in
that
his
politest
tone
i
think
it
certainly
as
well
that
i
came
down
and
i
flatter
myself
that
last
botte
was
a
successful
one
i
tell
you
how
i
came
to
think
of
it
three
years
ago
my
kind
friend
lady
ferrybridge
sent
for
me
in
the
greatest
state
of
alarm
about
her
son
gretna
whose
affair
you
remember
and
implored
me
to
use
my
influence
with
the
young
gentleman
who
was
engaged
in
an
affaire
de
coeur
with
a
scotch
clergyman
daughter
miss
mactoddy
i
implored
i
entreated
gentle
measures
but
lord
ferrybridge
was
furious
and
tried
the
high
hand
gretna
was
sulky
and
silent
and
his
parents
thought
they
had
conquered
but
what
was
the
fact
my
dear
creature
the
young
people
had
been
married
for
three
months
before
lord
ferrybridge
knew
anything
about
it
and
that
was
why
i
extracted
the
promise
from
master
arthur
would
never
have
done
so
pendennis
said
he
has
that
is
one
comfort
answered
the
like
a
wary
and
patient
man
of
the
world
major
pendennis
did
not
press
poor
pen
any
farther
for
the
moment
but
hoped
the
best
from
time
and
that
the
young
fellow
eyes
would
be
opened
before
long
to
see
the
absurdity
of
which
he
was
guilty
and
having
found
out
how
keen
the
boy
point
of
honour
was
he
worked
kindly
upon
that
kindly
feeling
with
great
skill
discoursing
him
over
their
wine
after
dinner
and
pointing
out
to
pen
the
necessity
of
a
perfect
uprightness
and
openness
in
all
his
dealings
and
entreating
that
his
communications
with
his
interesting
young
friend
as
the
major
politely
called
miss
fotheringay
should
be
carried
on
with
the
knowledge
if
not
approbation
of
pendennis
after
all
pen
the
major
said
with
a
convenient
frankness
that
did
not
displease
the
boy
whilst
it
advanced
the
interests
of
the
negotiator
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
you
are
throwing
yourself
away
your
mother
may
submit
to
your
marriage
as
she
would
to
anything
else
you
desired
if
you
did
but
cry
long
enough
for
it
but
be
sure
of
this
that
it
can
never
please
her
you
take
a
young
woman
off
the
boards
of
a
country
theatre
and
prefer
her
for
such
is
the
case
to
one
of
the
finest
ladies
in
england
and
your
mother
will
submit
to
your
choice
but
you
ca
suppose
that
she
will
be
happy
under
it
i
have
often
fancied
entre
nous
that
my
sister
had
it
in
her
eye
to
make
a
marriage
between
you
and
that
little
ward
of
hers
flora
laura
what
her
name
and
i
always
determined
to
do
my
small
endeavour
to
prevent
any
such
match
the
child
has
but
two
thousand
pounds
i
am
given
to
understand
it
is
only
with
the
utmost
economy
and
care
that
my
sister
can
provide
for
the
decent
maintenance
of
her
house
and
for
your
appearance
and
education
as
a
gentleman
and
i
do
care
to
own
to
you
that
i
had
other
and
much
higher
views
for
you
with
your
name
and
birth
sir
with
your
talents
which
i
suppose
are
respectable
with
the
friends
whom
i
have
the
honour
to
possess
i
could
have
placed
you
in
an
excellent
position
a
remarkable
position
for
a
young
man
of
such
exceeding
small
means
and
had
hoped
to
see
you
at
least
try
to
restore
the
honours
of
our
name
your
mother
softness
stopped
one
prospect
or
you
might
have
been
a
general
like
our
gallant
ancestor
who
fought
at
ramillies
and
malplaquet
i
had
another
plan
in
view
my
excellent
and
kind
friend
lord
bagwig
who
is
very
well
disposed
towards
me
would
i
have
little
doubt
have
attached
you
to
his
mission
at
pumpernickel
and
you
might
have
advanced
in
the
diplomatic
service
but
pardon
me
for
recurring
to
the
subject
how
is
a
man
to
serve
a
young
gentleman
of
eighteen
who
proposes
to
marry
a
lady
of
thirty
whom
he
has
selected
from
a
booth
in
a
fair
well
not
a
fair
a
barn
that
profession
at
once
is
closed
to
you
the
public
service
is
closed
to
you
society
is
closed
to
you
you
see
my
good
friend
to
what
you
bring
yourself
you
may
get
on
at
the
bar
to
be
sure
where
i
am
given
to
understand
that
gentlemen
of
merit
occasionally
marry
out
of
their
kitchens
but
in
no
other
profession
or
you
may
come
and
live
down
here
down
here
mon
dieu
for
ever
said
the
major
with
a
dreary
shrug
as
he
thought
with
inexpressible
fondness
of
pall
mall
where
your
mother
will
receive
the
arthur
that
is
to
be
with
perfect
kindness
where
the
good
people
of
the
county
wo
visit
you
and
where
by
gad
sir
i
shall
be
shy
of
visiting
you
myself
for
i
a
man
and
i
own
to
you
that
i
like
to
live
with
gentlemen
for
my
companions
where
you
will
have
to
live
with
drinking
gentlemen
farmers
and
drag
through
your
life
the
young
husband
of
an
old
woman
who
if
she
does
quarrel
with
your
mother
will
at
least
cost
that
lady
her
position
in
society
and
drag
her
down
into
that
dubious
caste
into
which
you
must
inevitably
fall
it
is
no
affair
of
mine
my
good
sir
i
am
not
angry
your
downfall
will
not
hurt
me
farther
than
that
it
will
extinguish
the
hopes
i
had
of
seeing
my
family
once
more
taking
its
place
in
the
world
it
is
only
your
mother
and
yourself
that
will
be
ruined
and
i
pity
you
both
from
my
soul
pass
the
claret
it
is
some
i
sent
to
your
poor
father
i
remember
i
bought
it
at
poor
lord
levant
sale
but
of
course
added
the
major
smacking
the
wine
having
engaged
yourself
you
will
do
what
becomes
you
as
a
man
of
honour
however
fatal
your
promise
may
be
however
promise
us
on
our
side
my
boy
what
i
set
out
by
entreating
you
to
grant
that
there
shall
be
nothing
clandestine
that
you
will
pursue
your
studies
that
you
will
only
visit
your
interesting
friend
at
proper
intervals
do
you
write
to
her
much
pen
blushed
and
said
why
yes
he
had
i
suppose
verses
eh
as
well
as
prose
i
was
a
dab
at
verses
myself
i
recollect
when
i
first
joined
i
used
to
write
verses
for
the
fellows
in
the
regiment
and
did
some
pretty
things
in
that
way
i
was
talking
to
my
old
friend
general
hobbler
about
some
lines
i
dashed
off
for
him
in
the
year
when
we
were
at
the
cape
and
gad
he
remembered
every
line
of
them
still
for
he
used
so
often
the
old
rogue
and
had
actually
tried
on
hobbler
sir
who
brought
him
sixty
thousand
pounds
i
suppose
you
tried
verses
eh
pen
pen
blushed
again
and
said
why
yes
he
had
written
and
does
the
fair
one
respond
in
poetry
or
prose
asked
the
major
eyeing
his
nephew
with
the
queerest
expression
as
much
as
to
say
o
moses
and
green
spectacles
what
a
fool
the
boy
pen
blushed
again
she
had
written
but
not
in
verse
the
young
lover
owned
and
he
gave
his
the
benefit
of
a
squeeze
with
his
left
arm
which
the
major
remarked
according
to
his
wont
you
have
got
the
letters
there
i
see
said
the
old
campaigner
nodding
at
pen
and
pointing
to
his
own
chest
which
was
manfully
wadded
with
cotton
by
stultz
you
know
you
have
i
would
give
twopence
to
see
why
said
pen
twiddling
the
stalks
of
the
strawberries
i
i
but
this
sentence
never
finished
for
pen
face
was
so
comical
and
embarrassed
as
the
major
watched
it
that
the
elder
could
contain
his
gravity
no
longer
and
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
in
which
chorus
pen
himself
was
obliged
to
join
after
a
minute
when
he
broke
out
fairly
into
a
guffaw
it
sent
them
with
great
into
pendennis
she
was
pleased
to
hear
them
laughing
in
the
hall
as
they
crossed
it
you
sly
rascal
said
the
major
putting
his
arm
gaily
on
shoulder
and
giving
a
playful
push
at
the
boy
he
felt
the
papers
crackling
there
sure
enough
the
young
fellow
was
delighted
conceited
triumphant
and
in
one
word
a
spoony
the
pair
came
to
the
in
the
highest
spirits
the
politeness
was
beyond
expression
he
had
never
tasted
such
good
tea
and
such
bread
was
only
to
be
had
in
the
country
he
asked
pendennis
for
one
of
her
charming
songs
he
then
made
pen
sing
and
was
delighted
and
astonished
at
the
beauty
of
the
boy
voice
he
made
his
nephew
fetch
his
maps
and
drawings
and
praised
them
as
really
remarkable
works
of
talent
in
a
young
fellow
he
complimented
him
on
his
french
pronunciation
he
flattered
the
simple
boy
as
adroitly
as
ever
lover
flattered
a
mistress
and
when
bedtime
came
mother
and
son
went
to
their
several
rooms
perfectly
enchanted
with
the
kind
major
when
they
had
reached
those
apartments
i
suppose
helen
took
to
her
knees
as
usual
and
pen
read
over
his
letters
before
going
to
bed
just
as
if
he
did
know
every
word
of
them
by
heart
already
in
truth
there
were
but
three
of
those
documents
and
to
learn
their
contents
required
no
great
effort
of
memory
in
no
miss
fotheringay
presents
grateful
compliments
to
pendennis
and
in
her
papa
name
and
her
own
begs
to
thank
him
for
his
most
beautiful
presents
they
will
always
be
kept
carefully
and
miss
and
captain
will
never
forget
the
delightful
evening
which
they
passed
on
tuesday
last
no
said
dear
sir
we
shall
have
a
small
quiet
party
of
social
friends
at
our
humble
board
next
tuesday
evening
at
an
early
tea
when
i
shall
wear
the
beautiful
scarf
which
with
its
accompanying
delightful
verses
i
shall
ever
ever
cherish
and
papa
bids
me
say
how
happy
he
will
be
if
you
will
join
feast
of
reason
and
the
flow
of
soul
in
our
festive
little
party
as
i
am
sure
will
be
your
truly
grateful
emily
fotheringay
no
was
somewhat
more
confidential
and
showed
that
matters
had
proceeded
rather
far
you
were
odious
yesterday
night
the
letter
said
why
did
you
not
come
to
the
papa
could
not
escort
me
on
account
of
his
eye
he
had
an
accident
and
fell
down
over
a
loose
carpet
on
the
stair
on
sunday
night
i
saw
you
looking
at
miss
diggle
all
night
and
you
were
so
enchanted
with
lydia
languish
you
scarcely
once
looked
at
julia
i
could
have
crushed
bingley
i
was
so
angry
i
play
ella
rosenberg
on
friday
will
you
come
then
miss
diggle
performs
ever
your
these
three
letters
mr
pen
used
to
read
at
intervals
during
the
day
and
night
and
embrace
with
that
delight
and
fervour
which
such
beautiful
compositions
surely
warranted
a
thousand
times
at
least
he
had
kissed
fondly
the
musky
satin
paper
made
sacred
to
him
by
the
hand
of
emily
fotheringay
this
was
all
he
had
in
return
for
his
passion
and
flames
his
vows
and
protests
his
rhymes
and
similes
his
wakeful
nights
and
endless
thoughts
his
fondness
fears
and
folly
the
young
wiseacre
had
pledged
away
his
all
for
this
signed
his
name
to
endless
promissory
notes
conferring
his
heart
upon
the
bearer
bound
himself
for
life
and
got
back
twopence
as
an
equivalent
for
miss
costigan
was
a
young
lady
of
such
perfect
and
that
she
never
would
have
thought
of
giving
more
and
reserved
the
treasures
of
her
affection
until
she
could
transfer
them
lawfully
at
church
howbeit
mr
pen
was
content
with
what
tokens
of
regard
he
had
got
and
mumbled
over
his
three
letters
in
a
rapture
of
high
spirits
and
went
to
sleep
delighted
with
his
kind
old
uncle
from
london
who
must
evidently
yield
to
his
wishes
in
time
and
in
a
word
in
a
preposterous
state
of
contentment
with
himself
and
all
the
world
chapter
ix
in
which
the
major
opens
the
campaign
let
those
who
have
a
real
and
heartfelt
relish
for
london
society
and
the
privilege
of
an
entree
into
its
most
select
circles
admit
that
major
pendennis
was
a
man
of
no
ordinary
generosity
and
affection
in
the
sacrifice
which
he
now
made
he
gave
up
london
in
may
his
newspapers
and
his
mornings
his
afternoons
from
club
to
club
his
little
confidential
visits
to
my
ladies
his
rides
in
rotten
row
his
dinners
and
his
stall
at
the
opera
his
rapid
escapades
to
fulham
or
richmond
on
saturdays
and
sundays
his
bow
from
my
lord
duke
or
my
lord
marquis
at
the
great
london
entertainments
and
his
name
in
the
morning
post
of
the
succeeding
day
his
quieter
little
festivals
more
select
secret
and
delightful
all
these
he
resigned
to
lock
himself
into
a
lone
little
country
house
with
a
simple
widow
and
a
greenhorn
of
a
son
a
mawkish
curate
and
a
little
girl
of
ten
years
of
age
he
made
the
sacrifice
and
it
was
the
greater
that
few
knew
the
extent
of
it
his
letters
came
down
franked
from
town
and
he
showed
the
invitations
to
helen
with
a
sigh
it
was
beautiful
and
tragical
to
see
him
refuse
one
party
after
another
at
least
to
those
who
could
understand
as
helen
did
the
melancholy
grandeur
of
his
helen
did
not
or
only
smiled
at
the
awful
pathos
with
which
the
major
spoke
of
the
court
guide
in
general
but
young
pen
looked
with
great
respect
at
the
great
names
upon
the
superscriptions
of
his
letters
and
listened
to
the
major
stories
about
the
fashionable
world
with
constant
interest
and
sympathy
the
elder
pendennis
rich
memory
was
stored
with
thousands
of
these
delightful
tales
and
he
poured
them
into
pen
willing
ear
with
unfailing
eloquence
he
knew
the
name
and
pedigree
of
everybody
in
the
peerage
and
everybody
relations
my
dear
boy
he
would
say
with
a
mournful
earnestness
and
veracity
you
can
not
begin
your
genealogical
studies
too
early
i
wish
to
heavens
you
would
read
in
debrett
every
day
not
so
much
the
historical
part
for
the
pedigrees
between
ourselves
are
many
of
them
very
fabulous
and
there
are
few
families
that
can
show
such
a
clear
descent
as
our
own
as
the
account
of
family
alliances
and
who
is
related
to
whom
i
have
known
a
man
career
in
life
blasted
by
ignorance
on
this
important
this
subject
why
only
last
month
at
dinner
at
my
lord
hobanob
a
young
man
who
has
lately
been
received
among
us
young
suckling
author
of
a
work
i
believe
began
to
speak
lightly
of
admiral
bowser
conduct
for
ratting
to
ministers
in
what
i
must
own
is
the
most
audacious
manner
but
who
do
you
think
sate
next
and
opposite
to
this
suckling
why
why
next
to
him
was
lady
grampound
bowser
daughter
and
opposite
to
him
was
lord
grampound
bowser
the
infatuated
young
man
went
on
cutting
his
jokes
at
the
admiral
expense
fancying
that
all
the
world
was
laughing
with
him
and
i
leave
you
to
imagine
lady
hobanob
feelings
hobanob
those
of
every
man
as
the
wretched
intru
was
so
exposing
himself
he
will
never
dine
again
in
south
street
i
promise
you
with
such
discourses
the
major
entertained
his
nephew
as
he
paced
the
terrace
in
front
of
the
house
for
his
two
hours
constitutional
walk
or
as
they
sate
together
after
dinner
over
their
wine
he
grieved
that
sir
francis
clavering
had
not
come
down
to
the
park
to
live
in
it
since
his
marriage
and
to
make
a
society
for
the
neighbourhood
he
mourned
that
lord
eyrie
was
not
in
the
country
that
he
might
take
pen
and
present
him
to
his
lordship
he
has
daughters
the
major
said
who
knows
you
might
have
married
lady
emily
or
lady
barbara
trehawk
but
all
those
dreams
are
over
my
poor
fellow
you
must
lie
on
the
bed
which
you
have
made
for
these
things
to
hear
did
young
pendennis
seriously
incline
they
are
not
so
interesting
in
print
as
when
delivered
orally
but
the
anecdotes
of
the
great
george
of
the
royal
dukes
of
the
statesmen
beauties
and
fashionable
ladies
of
the
day
filled
young
pen
soul
with
longing
and
wonder
and
he
found
the
conversations
with
his
guardian
which
sadly
bored
and
perplexed
poor
pendennis
for
his
own
part
never
tedious
it
ca
be
said
that
mr
pen
new
guide
philosopher
and
friend
discoursed
him
on
the
most
elevated
subjects
or
treated
the
subjects
which
he
chose
in
the
most
elevated
manner
but
his
morality
such
as
it
was
was
consistent
it
might
not
perhaps
tend
to
a
man
progress
in
another
world
but
it
was
pretty
well
calculated
to
advance
his
interests
in
this
and
then
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
major
never
for
one
instant
doubted
that
his
views
were
the
only
views
practicable
and
that
his
conduct
was
perfectly
virtuous
and
respectable
he
was
a
man
of
honour
in
a
word
and
had
his
eyes
what
he
called
open
he
took
pity
on
this
young
greenhorn
of
a
nephew
and
wanted
to
open
his
eyes
too
no
man
for
instance
went
more
regularly
to
church
when
in
the
country
than
the
old
bachelor
it
do
matter
so
much
in
town
pen
he
said
for
there
the
women
go
and
the
men
are
not
missed
but
when
a
gentleman
is
sur
ses
terres
he
must
give
an
example
to
the
country
people
and
if
i
could
turn
a
tune
i
even
think
i
should
sing
the
duke
of
saint
david
whom
i
have
the
honour
of
knowing
always
sings
in
the
country
and
let
me
tell
you
it
has
a
doosed
fine
effect
from
the
family
pew
and
you
are
somebody
down
here
as
long
as
the
claverings
are
away
you
are
the
first
man
in
the
parish
and
as
good
as
any
you
might
represent
the
town
if
you
played
your
cards
well
your
poor
dear
father
would
have
done
so
had
he
lived
so
might
not
if
you
marry
a
lady
however
amiable
whom
the
country
people
wo
well
well
it
a
painful
subject
let
us
change
it
my
but
if
major
pendennis
changed
the
subject
once
he
recurred
to
it
a
score
of
times
in
the
day
and
the
moral
of
his
discourse
always
was
that
pen
was
throwing
himself
away
now
it
does
not
require
much
coaxing
or
wheedling
to
make
a
simple
boy
believe
that
he
is
a
very
fine
fellow
pen
took
his
uncle
counsels
to
heart
he
was
glad
enough
we
have
said
to
listen
to
his
elder
talk
the
conversation
of
captain
costigan
became
by
no
means
pleasant
to
him
and
the
idea
of
that
tipsy
old
haunted
him
with
terror
he
could
bring
that
man
unshaven
and
reeking
of
punch
to
associate
with
his
mother
even
about
emily
he
faltered
when
the
pitiless
guardian
began
to
question
him
was
she
accomplished
he
was
obliged
to
own
no
was
she
clever
well
she
had
a
very
good
average
intellect
but
he
could
not
absolutely
say
she
was
clever
come
let
us
see
some
of
her
so
pen
confessed
that
he
had
but
those
three
of
which
we
have
made
mention
and
that
they
were
but
trivial
invitations
or
answers
she
is
cautious
enough
the
major
said
drily
she
is
older
than
you
my
poor
boy
and
then
he
apologised
with
the
utmost
frankness
and
humility
and
flung
himself
upon
pen
good
feelings
begging
the
lad
to
excuse
a
fond
old
uncle
who
had
only
his
family
honour
in
view
for
arthur
was
ready
to
flame
up
in
indignation
whenever
miss
honesty
was
doubted
and
swore
that
he
would
never
have
her
name
mentioned
lightly
and
never
never
would
part
from
her
he
repeated
this
to
his
uncle
and
his
friends
at
home
and
also
it
must
be
confessed
to
miss
fotheringay
and
the
amiable
family
at
chatteris
with
whom
he
still
continued
to
spend
some
portion
of
his
time
miss
emily
was
alarmed
when
she
heard
of
the
arrival
of
pen
guardian
and
rightly
conceived
that
the
major
came
down
with
hostile
intentions
to
herself
i
suppose
ye
intend
to
leave
me
now
your
grand
relation
has
come
down
from
town
he
carry
ye
off
and
you
forget
your
poor
emily
arthur
forget
her
in
her
presence
in
that
of
miss
rouncy
the
columbine
and
milly
confidential
friend
of
the
company
in
the
presence
of
the
captain
himself
pen
swore
he
never
could
think
of
any
other
woman
but
his
beloved
miss
fotheringay
and
the
captain
looking
up
at
his
foils
which
were
hung
as
a
trophy
on
the
wall
of
the
room
where
pen
and
he
used
to
fence
grimly
said
he
would
not
advoise
any
man
to
meddle
rashly
with
the
affections
of
his
darling
child
and
would
never
believe
his
gallant
young
arthur
whom
he
treated
as
his
son
whom
he
called
his
son
would
ever
be
guilty
of
conduct
so
revolting
to
every
idaya
of
honour
and
humanity
he
went
up
and
embraced
pen
after
speaking
he
cried
and
wiped
his
eye
with
one
large
dirty
hand
as
he
clasped
pen
with
the
other
arthur
shuddered
in
that
grasp
and
thought
of
his
uncle
at
home
his
looked
unusually
dirty
and
shabby
the
odour
of
was
even
more
decided
than
in
common
how
was
he
to
bring
that
man
and
his
mother
together
he
trembled
when
he
thought
that
he
had
absolutely
written
to
costigan
enclosing
to
him
a
sovereign
the
loan
of
which
the
worthy
gentleman
had
need
and
saying
that
one
day
he
hoped
to
sign
himself
his
affectionate
son
arthur
pendennis
he
was
glad
to
get
away
from
chatteris
that
day
from
miss
rouncy
the
confidante
from
the
old
toping
from
the
divine
emily
herself
o
emily
emily
he
cried
inwardly
as
he
rattled
homewards
on
rebecca
you
little
know
what
sacrifices
i
am
making
for
you
for
you
who
are
always
so
cold
so
cautious
so
mistrustful
and
he
thought
of
a
character
in
pope
to
whom
he
had
often
involuntarily
compared
her
pen
never
rode
over
to
chatteris
upon
a
certain
errand
but
the
major
found
out
on
what
errand
the
boy
had
been
faithful
to
his
plan
major
pendennis
gave
his
nephew
no
let
or
hindrance
but
somehow
the
constant
feeling
that
the
senior
eye
was
upon
him
an
uneasy
shame
attendant
upon
that
inevitable
confession
which
the
evening
conversation
would
be
sure
to
elicit
in
the
most
natural
simple
manner
made
pen
go
less
frequently
to
sigh
away
his
soul
at
the
feet
of
his
charmer
than
he
had
been
wont
to
do
previous
to
his
uncle
arrival
there
was
no
use
trying
to
deceive
him
there
was
no
pretext
of
dining
with
smirke
or
reading
greek
plays
with
foker
pen
felt
when
he
returned
from
one
of
his
flying
visits
that
everybody
knew
whence
he
came
and
appeared
quite
guilty
before
his
mother
and
guardian
over
their
books
or
their
game
at
picquet
once
having
walked
out
half
a
mile
to
the
fairoaks
inn
beyond
the
lodge
gates
to
be
in
readiness
for
the
competitor
coach
which
changed
horses
there
to
take
a
run
for
chatteris
a
man
on
the
roof
touched
his
hat
to
the
young
gentleman
it
was
his
uncle
man
morgan
who
was
going
on
a
message
for
his
master
and
had
been
took
up
at
the
lodge
as
he
said
and
morgan
came
back
by
the
rival
too
so
that
pen
had
the
pleasure
of
that
domestic
company
both
ways
nothing
was
said
at
home
the
lad
seemed
to
have
every
decent
liberty
and
yet
he
felt
himself
dimly
watched
and
guarded
and
that
there
were
eyes
upon
him
even
in
the
presence
of
his
dulcinea
in
fact
pen
suspicions
were
not
unfounded
and
his
guardian
had
sent
forth
to
gather
all
possible
information
regarding
the
lad
and
his
interesting
young
friend
the
discreet
and
ingenious
morgan
a
london
confidential
valet
whose
fidelity
could
be
trusted
had
been
to
chatteris
more
than
once
and
made
every
inquiry
regarding
the
past
history
and
present
habits
of
the
captain
and
his
daughter
he
delicately
the
waiters
the
ostlers
and
all
the
inmates
of
the
bar
at
the
george
and
got
from
them
what
little
they
knew
respecting
the
worthy
captain
he
was
not
held
in
very
great
regard
there
as
it
appeared
the
waiters
never
saw
the
colour
of
his
money
and
were
warned
not
to
furnish
the
poor
gentleman
with
any
liquor
for
which
some
other
party
was
not
responsible
he
swaggered
sadly
about
the
there
consumed
a
toothpick
and
looked
over
the
paper
and
if
any
friend
asked
him
to
dinner
he
stayed
morgan
heard
at
the
george
of
pen
acquaintance
with
foker
and
he
went
over
to
baymouth
to
enter
into
relations
with
that
gentleman
man
but
the
young
student
was
gone
to
a
coast
regatta
and
his
servant
of
course
travelled
in
charge
of
the
from
the
servants
of
the
officers
at
the
barracks
morgan
found
that
the
captain
had
so
frequently
and
outrageously
inebriated
himself
there
that
colonel
swallowtail
had
forbidden
him
the
messroom
the
indefatigable
morgan
then
put
himself
in
communication
with
some
of
the
inferior
actors
at
the
theatre
and
pumped
them
over
their
cigars
and
punch
and
all
agreed
that
costigan
was
poor
shabby
and
given
to
debt
and
to
drink
but
there
was
not
a
breath
upon
the
reputation
of
miss
fotheringay
her
father
courage
was
reported
to
have
displayed
itself
on
more
than
one
occasion
towards
persons
disposed
to
treat
his
daughter
with
freedom
she
never
came
to
the
theatre
but
with
her
father
in
his
most
inebriated
moments
that
gentleman
kept
a
watch
over
her
finally
morgan
from
his
own
experience
added
that
he
had
been
to
see
her
act
and
was
uncommon
delighted
with
the
performance
besides
thinking
her
a
most
splendid
woman
creed
the
confirmed
these
statements
to
doctor
portman
who
examined
her
personally
and
threatened
her
with
the
terrors
of
the
church
one
day
after
afternoon
service
creed
had
nothing
unfavourable
to
her
lodger
to
divulge
she
saw
nobody
only
one
or
two
ladies
of
the
theatre
the
captain
did
intoxicate
himself
sometimes
and
did
not
always
pay
his
rent
regularly
but
he
did
when
he
had
money
or
rather
miss
fotheringay
did
since
the
young
gentleman
from
clavering
had
been
and
took
lessons
in
fencing
one
or
two
more
had
come
from
the
barracks
sir
derby
oaks
and
his
young
friend
foker
which
was
often
together
and
which
was
always
driving
over
from
baymouth
in
the
tandem
but
on
the
occasions
of
the
lessons
miss
was
very
seldom
present
and
generally
came
downstairs
to
creed
own
room
the
doctor
and
the
major
consulting
together
as
they
often
did
groaned
in
spirit
over
that
information
major
pendennis
openly
expressed
his
disappointment
and
i
believe
the
divine
himself
was
ill
pleased
at
not
being
able
to
jack
a
hole
in
poor
miss
fotheringay
reputation
even
about
pen
himself
creed
reports
were
desperately
favourable
whenever
he
come
creed
said
she
always
have
me
or
one
of
the
children
with
her
and
creed
marm
says
she
if
you
please
marm
you
on
no
account
leave
the
room
when
that
young
gentleman
here
and
many
the
time
i
seen
him
a
lookin
as
if
he
wished
i
was
away
poor
young
man
and
he
took
to
coming
in
when
i
was
at
home
of
course
but
she
always
had
one
of
the
boys
up
if
her
pa
was
at
home
or
old
bowser
with
her
a
teaching
of
her
her
lesson
or
one
of
the
young
ladies
of
the
it
was
all
true
whatever
encouragements
might
have
been
given
him
before
he
avowed
his
passion
the
prudence
of
miss
emily
was
prodigious
after
pen
had
declared
himself
and
the
poor
fellow
chafed
against
her
hopeless
reserve
which
maintained
his
ardour
as
it
excited
his
anger
the
major
surveyed
the
state
of
things
with
a
sigh
if
it
were
but
a
temporary
liaison
the
excellent
man
said
one
could
bear
it
a
young
fellow
must
sow
his
wild
oats
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
a
virtuous
attachment
is
the
deuce
it
comes
of
the
d
d
romantic
notions
boys
get
from
being
brought
up
by
allow
me
to
say
major
that
you
speak
a
little
too
like
a
man
of
the
world
replied
the
doctor
nothing
can
be
more
desirable
for
pen
than
a
virtuous
attachment
for
a
young
lady
of
his
own
rank
and
with
a
corresponding
fortune
this
present
infatuation
of
course
i
must
deplore
as
sincerely
as
you
do
if
i
were
his
guardian
i
should
command
him
to
give
it
the
very
means
i
tell
you
to
make
him
marry
we
have
got
time
from
him
that
is
all
and
we
must
do
our
best
with
that
i
say
major
said
the
doctor
at
the
end
of
the
conversation
in
which
the
above
subject
was
discussed
i
am
not
of
course
a
man
but
suppose
i
say
we
go
and
see
the
major
laughed
he
had
been
a
fortnight
at
fairoaks
and
strange
to
say
had
not
thought
of
that
well
he
said
why
not
after
all
it
is
not
my
niece
but
miss
fotheringay
the
actress
and
we
have
as
good
a
right
as
any
other
of
the
public
to
see
her
if
we
pay
our
so
upon
a
day
when
it
was
arranged
that
pen
was
to
dine
at
home
and
pass
the
evening
with
his
mother
the
two
elderly
gentlemen
drove
over
to
chatteris
in
the
doctor
chaise
and
there
like
a
couple
of
jolly
bachelors
dined
at
the
george
inn
before
proceeding
to
the
play
only
two
other
guests
were
in
the
room
an
officer
of
the
regiment
quartered
at
chatteris
and
a
young
gentleman
whom
the
doctor
thought
he
had
somewhere
seen
they
left
them
at
their
meal
however
and
hastened
to
the
theatre
it
was
hamlet
over
again
shakspeare
was
article
xl
of
stout
old
doctor
portman
creed
to
which
he
always
made
a
point
of
testifying
publicly
at
least
once
in
a
year
we
have
described
the
play
before
and
how
those
who
saw
miss
fotheringay
perform
in
ophelia
saw
precisely
the
same
thing
on
one
night
as
on
another
both
the
elderly
gentlemen
looked
at
her
with
extraordinary
interest
thinking
how
very
much
young
pen
was
charmed
with
her
gad
said
the
major
between
his
teeth
as
he
surveyed
her
when
she
was
called
forward
as
usual
and
swept
her
curtsies
to
the
scanty
audience
the
young
rascal
has
not
made
a
bad
the
doctor
applauded
her
loudly
and
loyally
upon
my
word
said
he
she
is
a
very
clever
actress
and
i
must
say
major
she
is
endowed
with
very
considerable
personal
so
that
young
officer
thinks
in
the
major
pendennis
answered
and
he
pointed
out
to
doctor
portman
attention
the
young
dragoon
of
the
george
who
sate
in
the
box
in
question
and
applauded
with
immense
enthusiasm
she
looked
extremely
sweet
upon
him
too
thought
the
major
but
that
their
way
and
he
shut
up
his
natty
and
pocketed
it
as
if
he
wished
to
see
no
more
that
night
nor
did
the
doctor
of
course
propose
to
stay
for
the
so
they
rose
and
left
the
theatre
the
doctor
returning
to
portman
who
was
on
a
visit
at
the
deanery
and
the
major
walking
home
full
of
thought
towards
the
george
where
he
had
bespoken
a
bed
chapter
x
facing
the
enemy
sauntering
slowly
homewards
major
pendennis
reached
the
george
presently
and
found
morgan
his
faithful
valet
awaiting
him
at
the
door
of
the
george
inn
who
stopped
his
master
as
he
was
about
to
take
a
candle
to
go
to
bed
and
said
with
his
usual
air
of
knowing
deference
i
think
sir
if
you
would
go
into
the
there
a
young
gentleman
there
as
you
would
like
to
what
is
arthur
here
the
major
said
in
great
anger
no
sir
but
his
great
friend
foker
sir
lady
hagnes
son
is
here
sir
he
been
asleep
in
the
since
he
took
his
dinner
and
has
just
rung
for
his
coffee
sir
and
i
think
you
might
like
to
git
into
conversation
with
him
the
valet
said
opening
the
door
the
major
entered
and
there
indeed
was
foker
the
only
occupant
of
the
place
he
was
rubbing
his
eyes
and
sate
before
a
table
decorated
with
empty
decanters
and
relics
of
dessert
he
had
intended
to
go
to
the
play
too
but
sleep
had
overtaken
him
after
a
copious
meal
and
he
had
flung
up
his
legs
on
the
bench
and
indulged
in
a
nap
instead
of
the
dramatic
amusement
the
major
was
meditating
how
to
address
the
young
man
but
the
latter
prevented
him
that
trouble
like
to
look
at
the
evening
paper
sir
said
foker
who
was
always
communicative
and
affable
and
he
took
up
the
globe
from
his
table
and
offered
it
to
the
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
said
the
major
with
a
grateful
bow
and
smile
if
i
do
mistake
the
family
likeness
i
have
the
pleasure
of
speaking
to
henry
foker
lady
agnes
foker
son
i
have
the
happiness
to
name
her
ladyship
among
my
acquaintances
and
you
bear
sir
a
rosherville
hullo
i
beg
your
pardon
foker
said
i
took
you
he
was
going
to
say
i
took
you
for
a
commercial
but
he
stopped
that
phrase
to
whom
have
i
the
pleasure
of
speaking
he
added
to
a
relative
of
a
friend
and
schoolfellow
of
yours
arthur
pendennis
my
nephew
who
has
often
spoken
to
me
about
you
in
terms
of
great
regard
i
am
major
pendennis
of
whom
you
may
have
heard
him
speak
may
i
take
my
at
your
table
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
sitting
at
your
sir
you
do
me
proud
said
foker
with
much
courtesy
and
so
you
are
arthur
pendennis
uncle
are
you
and
guardian
added
the
major
he
as
good
a
fellow
as
ever
stepped
sir
said
foker
i
am
glad
you
think
and
clever
too
i
was
always
a
stupid
chap
i
was
but
you
see
sir
i
know
when
they
are
clever
and
like
of
that
you
show
your
taste
and
your
modesty
too
said
the
major
i
have
heard
arthur
repeatedly
speak
of
you
and
he
said
your
talents
were
very
i
not
good
at
the
books
foker
said
wagging
his
head
never
could
manage
that
pendennis
could
he
used
to
do
half
the
verses
and
yet
the
young
gentleman
broke
out
you
are
his
guardian
and
i
hope
you
will
pardon
me
for
saying
that
i
think
he
what
we
call
flat
the
candid
young
gentleman
said
the
major
found
himself
on
the
instant
in
the
midst
of
a
most
interesting
and
confidential
conversation
and
how
is
arthur
a
flat
he
asked
with
a
smile
you
know
foker
answered
winking
at
him
he
would
have
winked
at
the
duke
of
wellington
with
just
as
little
scruple
for
he
was
in
that
state
of
absence
candour
and
fearlessness
which
a
man
sometimes
possesses
after
drinking
a
couple
of
bottles
of
wine
you
know
arthur
a
flat
about
women
i
he
is
not
the
first
of
us
my
dear
harry
answered
the
major
i
have
heard
something
of
this
but
pray
tell
me
why
sir
you
see
it
partly
my
fault
he
went
to
the
play
one
night
for
you
see
i
down
here
readin
for
my
little
go
during
the
long
only
i
come
over
from
baymouth
pretty
often
in
my
drag
well
sir
we
went
to
the
play
and
pen
was
struck
all
of
a
heap
with
miss
fotheringay
costigan
her
real
name
is
an
uncommon
fine
gal
she
is
too
and
the
next
morning
i
introduced
him
to
the
general
as
we
call
her
father
a
regular
old
scamp
and
such
a
boy
for
the
and
he
gone
on
being
intimate
there
and
fallen
in
love
with
her
and
i
blessed
if
he
has
proposed
to
her
foker
said
slapping
his
hand
on
the
table
until
all
the
dessert
began
to
jingle
what
you
know
it
too
asked
the
major
know
it
do
i
and
many
more
too
we
were
talking
about
it
at
mess
yesterday
and
chaffing
derby
oaks
until
he
was
as
mad
as
a
hatter
know
sir
derby
oaks
we
dined
together
and
he
went
to
the
play
we
were
standing
at
the
door
smoking
i
remember
when
you
passed
in
to
i
remember
sir
thomas
oaks
his
father
before
he
was
a
baronet
or
a
knight
he
lived
in
and
was
physician
to
queen
the
young
one
is
making
the
money
spin
i
can
tell
you
foker
said
and
is
sir
derby
oaks
the
major
said
with
great
delight
and
anxiety
another
soupirant
another
what
inquired
foker
another
admirer
of
miss
fotheringay
lord
bless
you
we
call
him
mondays
wednesdays
and
fridays
and
pen
tuesdays
thursdays
and
saturdays
but
mind
you
nothing
wrong
no
no
miss
is
a
deal
too
for
that
major
pendennis
she
plays
one
off
against
the
other
what
you
call
two
strings
to
her
i
think
you
seem
tolerably
too
foker
pendennis
said
laughing
pretty
well
thank
you
sir
how
are
you
foker
replied
imperturbably
i
not
clever
but
i
am
rather
downy
and
partial
friends
say
i
know
what
tolerably
well
can
i
tell
you
the
time
of
day
in
any
way
upon
my
word
the
major
answered
quite
delighted
i
think
you
may
be
of
very
great
service
to
me
you
are
a
young
man
of
the
world
and
with
such
one
likes
to
deal
and
as
such
i
need
not
inform
you
that
our
family
is
by
no
means
delighted
at
this
absurd
intrigue
in
which
arthur
is
i
should
rather
think
not
said
foker
connexion
not
eligible
too
much
beer
drunk
on
the
premises
no
irish
need
apply
that
i
take
to
be
your
the
major
said
it
was
exactly
though
in
truth
he
did
not
quite
understand
what
foker
meaning
was
and
he
proceeded
to
examine
his
new
acquaintance
regarding
the
amiable
family
into
which
his
nephew
proposed
to
enter
and
soon
got
from
the
candid
witness
a
number
of
particulars
regarding
the
house
of
costigan
we
must
do
foker
the
justice
to
say
that
he
spoke
most
favourably
of
and
miss
costigan
moral
character
you
see
said
he
i
think
the
general
is
fond
of
the
jovial
bowl
and
if
i
wanted
to
be
very
certain
of
my
money
it
is
in
his
pocket
i
invest
it
but
he
has
always
kept
a
watchful
eye
on
his
daughter
and
neither
he
nor
she
will
stand
anything
but
what
honourable
pen
attentions
to
her
are
talked
about
in
the
whole
company
and
i
hear
all
about
them
from
a
young
lady
who
used
to
be
very
intimate
with
her
and
with
whose
family
i
sometimes
take
tea
in
a
friendly
way
miss
rouncy
says
sir
derby
oaks
has
been
hanging
about
miss
fotheringay
ever
since
his
regiment
has
been
down
here
but
pen
has
come
in
and
cut
him
out
lately
which
has
made
the
baronet
so
mad
that
he
has
been
very
near
on
the
point
of
proposing
too
wish
he
would
and
you
see
which
of
the
two
miss
fotheringay
would
jump
i
thought
as
much
the
major
said
you
give
me
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
foker
i
wish
i
could
have
seen
you
did
like
to
put
in
my
oar
replied
the
other
do
speak
till
asked
when
if
there
no
objections
i
speak
pretty
freely
heard
your
man
had
been
hankering
about
my
servant
did
know
myself
what
was
going
on
until
miss
fotheringay
and
miss
rouncy
had
the
row
about
the
ostrich
feathers
when
miss
told
me
miss
rouncy
i
gather
was
the
confidante
of
the
confidant
i
believe
you
why
she
twice
as
clever
a
girl
as
fotheringay
and
literary
and
that
while
miss
foth
ca
do
much
more
than
she
can
write
said
the
major
remembering
pen
foker
broke
out
into
a
sardonic
he
he
rouncy
writes
her
letters
he
said
every
one
of
and
since
they
quarrelled
she
do
know
how
the
deuce
to
get
on
miss
rouncy
is
an
uncommon
pretty
hand
whereas
the
old
one
makes
dreadful
work
of
the
writing
and
spelling
when
bows
ai
by
rouncy
been
settin
her
copies
lately
she
writes
a
beautiful
hand
rouncy
i
suppose
you
know
it
pretty
well
said
the
major
archly
upon
which
foker
winked
at
him
again
i
would
give
a
great
deal
to
have
a
specimen
of
her
continued
major
pendennis
i
dare
say
you
could
give
me
no
no
that
would
be
too
bad
foker
replied
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
said
as
much
as
i
have
miss
writin
ai
so
very
bad
i
dare
say
only
she
got
miss
to
write
the
first
letter
and
has
gone
on
ever
since
but
you
mark
my
word
that
till
they
are
friends
again
the
letters
will
i
hope
they
will
never
be
reconciled
the
major
said
with
great
sincerity
and
i
ca
tell
you
how
delighted
i
am
to
have
had
the
good
fortune
of
making
your
acquaintance
you
must
feel
my
dear
sir
as
a
man
of
the
world
how
fatal
to
my
nephew
prospects
in
life
is
this
step
which
he
contemplates
and
how
eager
we
all
must
be
to
free
him
from
this
absurd
he
has
come
out
uncommon
strong
said
foker
i
have
seen
his
verses
rouncy
copied
and
i
said
to
myself
when
i
saw
me
writin
verses
to
a
woman
that
all
he
has
made
a
fool
of
himself
as
many
a
good
fellow
has
before
him
how
can
we
make
him
see
his
folly
and
cure
it
i
am
sure
you
will
give
us
what
aid
you
can
in
extricating
a
generous
young
man
from
such
a
pair
of
schemers
as
this
father
and
daughter
seem
to
be
love
on
the
side
is
out
of
the
love
indeed
foker
said
if
pen
had
two
thousand
a
year
when
he
came
of
age
if
pen
had
what
cried
out
the
major
in
astonishment
two
thousand
a
year
has
he
got
two
thousand
a
year
the
general
says
he
my
dear
friend
shrieked
out
the
major
with
an
eagerness
which
this
gentleman
rarely
showed
thank
you
thank
you
i
begin
to
see
two
thousand
a
year
why
his
mother
has
but
five
hundred
a
year
in
the
she
is
likely
to
live
to
eighty
and
arthur
has
not
a
shilling
but
what
she
can
allow
what
he
ai
rich
then
foker
asked
upon
my
honour
he
has
no
more
than
what
i
and
you
ai
going
to
leave
him
anything
the
major
had
sunk
every
shilling
he
could
scrape
together
on
an
annuity
and
of
course
was
going
to
leave
pen
nothing
but
he
did
not
tell
foker
this
how
much
do
you
think
a
major
on
can
save
he
asked
if
these
people
have
been
looking
at
him
as
a
fortune
they
are
utterly
mistaken
and
and
you
have
made
me
the
happiest
man
in
the
sir
to
you
said
foker
politely
and
when
they
parted
for
the
night
they
shook
hands
with
the
greatest
cordiality
the
younger
gentleman
promising
the
elder
not
to
leave
chatteris
without
a
further
conversation
in
the
morning
and
as
the
major
went
up
to
his
room
and
foker
smoked
his
cigar
against
the
door
pillars
of
the
george
pen
very
likely
ten
miles
off
was
lying
in
bed
kissing
the
letter
from
his
emily
the
next
morning
before
foker
drove
off
in
his
drag
the
insinuating
major
had
actually
got
a
letter
of
miss
rouncy
in
his
own
let
it
be
a
lesson
to
women
how
they
write
and
in
very
high
spirits
major
pendennis
went
to
call
upon
doctor
portman
at
the
deanery
and
told
him
what
happy
discoveries
he
had
made
on
the
previous
night
as
they
sate
in
confidential
conversation
in
the
dean
oak
they
could
look
across
the
lawn
and
see
captain
costigan
window
at
which
poor
pen
had
been
only
too
visible
some
three
weeks
since
the
doctor
was
most
indignant
against
creed
the
landlady
for
her
duplicity
in
concealing
sir
derby
oaks
constant
visits
to
her
lodgers
and
threatened
to
excommunicate
her
out
of
the
cathedral
but
the
wary
major
thought
that
all
things
were
for
the
best
and
having
taken
counsel
with
himself
over
night
felt
himself
quite
strong
enough
to
go
and
face
captain
costigan
i
going
to
fight
the
dragon
he
said
with
a
laugh
to
doctor
portman
and
i
shrive
you
sir
and
bid
good
fortune
go
with
you
answered
the
doctor
perhaps
he
and
portman
and
miss
myra
as
they
sate
with
their
friend
the
dean
lady
in
her
looked
up
more
than
once
at
the
enemy
window
to
see
if
they
could
perceive
any
signs
of
the
combat
the
major
walked
round
according
to
the
directions
given
him
and
soon
found
creed
little
door
he
passed
it
and
as
he
ascended
to
captain
costigan
apartment
he
could
hear
a
stamping
of
feet
and
a
great
shouting
of
ha
ha
within
it
sir
derby
oaks
taking
his
fencing
lesson
said
the
child
who
piloted
major
pendennis
he
takes
it
mondays
wednesdays
and
the
major
knocked
and
at
length
a
tall
gentleman
came
forth
with
a
foil
and
mask
in
one
hand
and
a
fencing
glove
on
the
other
pendennis
made
him
a
deferential
bow
i
believe
i
have
the
honour
of
speaking
to
captain
costigan
my
name
is
major
the
captain
brought
his
weapon
up
to
the
salute
and
said
major
the
honer
is
moine
i
deloighted
to
see
chapter
xi
negotiation
the
major
and
captain
costigan
were
old
soldiers
and
accustomed
to
face
the
enemy
so
we
may
presume
that
they
retained
their
presence
of
mind
perfectly
but
the
rest
of
the
party
assembled
in
cos
were
perhaps
a
little
flurried
at
pendennis
apparition
miss
fotheringay
slow
heart
began
to
beat
no
doubt
for
her
cheek
flushed
up
with
a
great
healthy
blush
as
lieutenant
sir
derby
oaks
looked
at
her
with
a
scowl
the
little
crooked
old
man
in
the
who
had
been
witnessing
the
between
the
two
gentlemen
whose
stamping
and
jumping
had
been
such
as
to
cause
him
to
give
up
all
attempts
to
continue
writing
the
theatre
music
in
the
copying
of
which
he
had
been
engaged
looked
up
eagerly
towards
the
as
the
major
of
the
boots
entered
the
apartment
distributing
the
most
graceful
bows
to
everybody
present
me
daughter
me
friend
bows
me
gallant
young
pupil
and
friend
i
may
call
sir
derby
oaks
said
costigan
splendidly
waving
his
hand
and
pointing
each
of
these
individuals
to
the
major
attention
in
one
moment
meejor
i
your
humble
servant
and
to
dash
into
the
little
adjoining
chamber
where
he
slept
to
give
a
twist
to
his
lank
hair
with
his
a
wonderful
and
ancient
piece
to
tear
off
his
old
stock
and
put
on
a
new
one
which
emily
had
constructed
for
him
and
to
assume
a
handsome
clean
collar
and
the
new
coat
which
had
been
ordered
upon
the
occasion
of
miss
fotheringay
benefit
was
with
the
still
active
costigan
the
work
of
a
minute
after
him
sir
derby
entered
and
presently
emerged
from
the
same
apartment
where
he
also
cased
himself
in
his
little
which
fitted
tightly
upon
the
young
officer
big
person
and
which
he
and
miss
fotheringay
and
poor
pen
too
perhaps
admired
prodigiously
meanwhile
conversation
was
engaged
between
the
actress
and
the
and
the
usual
remarks
about
the
weather
had
been
interchanged
before
costigan
in
his
new
as
he
called
it
i
need
apologoise
to
ye
meejor
he
said
in
his
richest
and
most
courteous
manner
for
receiving
ye
in
me
an
old
soldier
ca
be
better
employed
than
in
teaching
a
young
one
the
use
of
his
sword
answered
the
major
gallantly
i
remember
in
old
times
hearing
that
you
could
use
yours
pretty
well
captain
what
ye
heard
of
jack
costigan
major
said
the
other
greatly
the
major
had
indeed
he
had
pumped
his
nephew
concerning
his
new
friend
the
irish
officer
and
whether
he
had
no
other
knowledge
of
the
captain
than
what
he
had
thus
gained
or
whether
he
actually
remembered
him
we
can
not
say
but
major
pendennis
was
a
person
of
honour
and
undoubted
veracity
and
said
that
he
perfectly
well
recollected
meeting
costigan
and
hearing
him
sing
at
sir
richard
strachan
table
at
walcheren
at
this
information
and
the
bland
and
cordial
manner
in
which
it
was
conveyed
bows
looked
up
entirely
puzzled
but
we
will
talk
of
these
matters
another
time
the
major
continued
perhaps
not
wishing
to
commit
himself
it
is
to
miss
fotheringay
that
i
came
to
pay
my
respects
and
he
performed
another
bow
for
her
so
courtly
and
gracious
that
if
she
had
been
a
duchess
he
could
not
have
made
it
more
handsome
i
had
heard
of
your
performances
from
my
nephew
madam
the
major
said
who
raves
about
you
as
i
believe
you
know
pretty
well
but
arthur
is
but
a
boy
and
a
wild
enthusiastic
young
fellow
whose
opinions
one
must
not
take
au
pied
de
la
lettre
and
i
confess
i
was
anxious
to
judge
for
myself
permit
me
to
say
your
performance
delighted
and
astonished
me
i
have
seen
our
best
actresses
and
on
my
word
i
think
you
surpass
them
all
you
are
as
majestic
as
faith
i
always
said
so
costigan
said
winking
at
his
daughter
major
take
a
milly
rose
at
this
hint
took
an
unripped
satin
garment
off
the
only
vacant
seat
and
brought
the
latter
to
major
pendennis
with
one
of
her
finest
curtseys
you
are
as
pathetic
as
miss
he
continued
bowing
and
seating
himself
your
snatches
of
song
reminded
me
of
jordan
in
her
best
time
when
we
were
young
men
captain
costigan
and
your
manner
reminded
me
of
mars
did
you
ever
see
the
mars
miss
fotheringay
there
was
two
mahers
in
crow
street
remarked
miss
emily
fanny
was
well
enough
but
biddy
was
no
great
sure
the
major
means
the
god
of
war
milly
my
dear
interposed
the
parent
it
is
not
that
mars
i
meant
though
venus
i
suppose
may
be
pardoned
for
thinking
about
him
the
major
replied
with
a
smile
directed
in
full
to
sir
derby
oaks
who
now
in
his
but
the
lady
did
not
understand
the
words
of
which
he
made
use
nor
did
the
compliment
at
all
pacify
sir
derby
who
probably
did
not
understand
it
either
and
at
any
rate
received
it
with
great
sulkiness
and
stiffness
scowling
uneasily
at
miss
fotheringay
with
an
expression
which
seemed
to
ask
what
the
deuce
does
this
man
here
major
pendennis
was
not
in
the
least
annoyed
by
the
on
the
contrary
it
delighted
him
so
thought
he
a
rival
is
in
the
field
and
he
offered
up
vows
that
sir
derby
might
be
not
only
a
rival
but
a
winner
too
in
this
in
which
he
and
pen
were
engaged
i
fear
i
interrupted
your
fencing
lesson
but
my
stay
in
chatteris
is
very
short
and
i
was
anxious
to
make
myself
known
to
my
old
captain
costigan
and
to
see
a
lady
nearer
who
had
charmed
me
so
much
from
the
stage
i
was
not
the
only
man
epris
last
night
miss
fotheringay
if
i
must
call
you
so
though
your
own
family
name
is
a
very
ancient
and
noble
one
there
was
a
reverend
friend
of
mine
who
went
home
in
raptures
with
ophelia
and
i
saw
sir
derby
oaks
fling
a
bouquet
which
no
actress
ever
merited
better
i
should
have
brought
one
myself
had
i
known
what
i
was
going
to
see
are
not
those
the
very
flowers
in
a
glass
of
water
on
the
mantelpiece
yonder
i
am
very
fond
of
flowers
said
miss
fotheringay
with
a
languishing
ogle
at
sir
derby
oaks
but
the
baronet
still
scowled
sulkily
sweets
to
the
sweet
is
that
the
expression
of
the
play
pendennis
asked
bent
upon
being
my
life
i
do
know
very
likely
it
is
i
ai
much
of
a
literary
man
answered
sir
derby
is
it
possible
the
major
continued
with
an
air
of
surprise
you
do
inherit
your
father
love
of
letters
then
sir
derby
he
was
a
remarkably
fine
scholar
and
i
had
the
honour
of
knowing
him
very
indeed
said
the
other
and
gave
a
sulky
wag
of
his
head
he
saved
my
life
continued
pendennis
did
he
now
cried
miss
fotheringay
rolling
her
eyes
first
upon
the
major
with
surprise
then
towards
sir
derby
with
gratitude
but
the
latter
was
proof
against
those
glances
and
far
from
appearing
to
be
pleased
that
the
apothecary
his
father
should
have
saved
major
pendennis
life
the
young
man
actually
looked
as
if
he
wished
the
event
had
turned
the
other
way
my
father
i
believe
was
a
very
good
doctor
the
young
gentleman
said
by
way
of
reply
i
not
in
that
line
myself
i
wish
you
good
morning
sir
i
got
an
appointment
cos
miss
fotheringay
good
and
in
spite
of
the
young
lady
imploring
looks
and
appealing
smiles
the
dragoon
bowed
stiffly
out
of
the
room
and
the
clatter
of
his
sabre
was
heard
as
he
strode
down
the
creaking
stair
and
the
angry
tones
of
his
voice
as
he
cursed
little
tom
creed
who
was
disporting
in
the
passage
and
whose
sir
derby
kicked
away
with
an
oath
into
the
street
the
major
did
not
smile
in
the
least
though
he
had
every
reason
to
be
amused
monstrous
handsome
young
man
that
as
fine
a
looking
soldier
as
ever
i
saw
he
said
to
costigan
a
credit
to
the
army
and
to
human
nature
in
general
answered
costigan
a
young
man
of
refoined
manners
polite
affabilitee
and
princely
fortune
his
table
is
sumptuous
he
adawr
in
the
regiment
and
he
rides
sixteen
a
perfect
champion
said
the
major
laughing
i
have
no
doubt
all
the
ladies
admire
he
very
well
in
spite
of
his
weight
now
he
young
said
milly
but
he
no
he
best
on
horseback
bows
said
on
which
milly
replied
that
the
baronet
had
ridden
third
in
the
on
his
horse
tareaways
and
the
major
began
to
comprehend
that
the
young
lady
herself
was
not
of
a
particular
genius
and
to
wonder
how
she
should
be
so
stupid
and
act
so
well
costigan
with
irish
hospitality
of
course
pressed
refreshment
upon
his
guest
and
the
major
who
was
no
more
hungry
than
you
are
after
a
lord
mayor
dinner
declared
that
he
should
like
a
biscuit
and
a
glass
of
wine
above
all
things
as
he
felt
quite
faint
from
long
fasting
but
he
knew
that
to
receive
small
kindnesses
flatters
the
donors
very
much
and
that
people
must
needs
grow
well
disposed
towards
you
as
they
give
you
their
hospitality
some
of
the
old
madara
milly
love
costigan
said
winking
to
his
child
and
that
lady
turning
to
her
father
a
glance
of
intelligence
went
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
stair
where
she
softly
summoned
her
little
emissary
master
tommy
creed
and
giving
him
a
piece
of
money
ordered
him
to
go
buy
a
pint
of
madara
wine
at
the
grapes
and
sixpennyworth
of
sorted
biscuits
at
the
baker
and
to
return
in
a
hurry
when
he
might
have
two
biscuits
for
himself
whilst
tommy
creed
was
gone
on
this
errand
miss
costigan
sate
below
with
creed
telling
her
landlady
how
arthur
pendennis
uncle
the
major
was
a
nice
old
gentleman
that
butter
would
melt
in
his
mouth
and
how
sir
derby
had
gone
out
of
the
room
in
a
rage
of
jealousy
and
thinking
what
must
be
done
to
pacify
both
of
them
she
keeps
the
keys
of
the
cellar
major
said
costigan
as
the
girl
left
the
room
upon
my
word
you
have
a
very
beautiful
butler
answered
pendennis
gallantly
and
i
do
wonder
at
the
young
fellows
raving
about
her
when
we
were
of
their
age
captain
costigan
i
think
plainer
women
would
have
done
our
faith
and
ye
may
say
that
sir
and
lucky
is
the
man
who
gets
her
ask
me
friend
bob
bows
here
whether
miss
fotheringay
moind
is
not
even
shuparior
to
her
person
and
whether
she
does
not
possess
a
cultiveated
intellect
a
refoined
understanding
and
an
emiable
disposition
o
of
course
said
bows
rather
drily
here
comes
hebe
blushing
from
the
cellar
do
you
think
it
is
time
to
go
to
rehearsal
miss
hebe
you
will
be
fined
if
you
are
later
and
he
gave
the
young
lady
a
look
which
intimated
that
they
had
much
better
leave
the
room
and
the
two
elders
together
at
this
order
miss
hebe
took
up
her
bonnet
and
shawl
looking
uncommonly
pretty
and
smiling
and
bows
gathered
up
his
roll
of
papers
and
hobbled
across
the
room
for
his
hat
and
cane
must
you
go
said
the
major
ca
you
give
us
a
few
minutes
more
miss
fotheringay
before
you
leave
us
permit
an
old
fellow
to
shake
you
by
the
hand
and
believe
that
i
am
proud
to
have
had
the
honour
of
making
your
acquaintance
and
am
most
sincerely
anxious
to
be
your
miss
fotheringay
made
a
low
curtsey
at
the
conclusion
of
this
gallant
speech
and
the
major
followed
her
retreating
steps
to
the
door
where
he
squeezed
her
hand
with
the
kindest
and
most
paternal
pressure
bows
was
puzzled
with
this
exhibition
of
cordiality
the
lad
relatives
ca
be
really
wanting
to
marry
him
to
her
he
thought
and
so
they
departed
now
for
it
thought
major
pendennis
and
as
for
costigan
he
profited
instantaneously
by
his
daughter
absence
to
drink
up
the
rest
of
the
wine
and
tossed
off
one
bumper
after
another
of
the
madeira
from
the
grapes
with
an
eager
shaking
hand
the
major
came
up
to
the
table
and
took
up
his
glass
and
drained
it
with
a
jovial
smack
if
it
had
been
lord
steyne
particular
and
not
cape
he
could
not
have
appeared
to
relish
it
more
capital
madeira
captain
costigan
he
said
where
do
you
get
it
i
drink
the
health
of
that
charming
creature
in
a
bumper
faith
captain
i
do
wonder
that
the
men
are
wild
about
her
i
never
saw
such
eyes
in
my
life
or
such
a
grand
manner
i
am
sure
she
is
as
intellectual
as
she
is
beautiful
and
i
have
no
doubt
she
as
good
as
she
is
a
good
girl
sir
a
good
girl
sir
said
the
delighted
father
and
i
pledge
a
toast
to
her
with
all
my
heart
shall
i
send
to
the
to
the
cellar
for
another
pint
it
handy
by
no
well
indeed
sir
ye
may
say
she
is
a
good
girl
and
the
pride
and
glory
of
her
father
honest
old
jack
costigan
the
man
who
gets
her
will
have
a
to
a
wife
sir
and
i
drink
his
health
sir
and
ye
know
who
i
mean
i
am
not
surprised
at
young
or
old
falling
in
love
with
her
said
the
major
and
frankly
must
tell
you
that
though
i
was
very
angry
with
my
poor
nephew
arthur
when
i
heard
of
the
boy
passion
now
i
have
seen
the
lady
i
can
pardon
him
any
extent
of
it
by
george
i
should
like
to
enter
for
the
race
myself
if
i
were
an
old
fellow
and
a
poor
and
no
better
man
major
i
sure
cried
jack
enraptured
your
friendship
sir
delights
me
your
admiration
for
my
girl
brings
tears
to
me
eyes
tears
sir
manlee
tears
and
when
she
leaves
me
humble
home
for
your
own
more
splendid
mansion
i
hope
she
keep
a
place
for
her
poor
old
father
poor
old
jack
the
captain
suited
the
action
to
the
word
and
his
bloodshot
eyes
were
suffused
with
water
as
he
addressed
the
major
your
sentiments
do
you
honour
the
other
said
but
captain
costigan
i
ca
help
smiling
at
one
thing
you
have
just
and
what
that
sir
asked
jack
who
was
at
a
too
heroic
and
sentimental
pitch
to
descend
from
it
you
were
speaking
about
our
splendid
mansion
my
sister
house
i
mean
i
mane
the
park
and
mansion
of
arthur
pendennis
esquire
of
fairoaks
park
whom
i
hope
to
see
a
mimber
of
parliament
for
his
native
town
of
clavering
when
he
is
of
ege
to
take
that
responsible
stetion
cried
the
captain
with
much
dignity
the
major
smiled
as
he
recognised
a
shaft
of
his
own
bow
it
was
he
who
had
set
pen
upon
the
idea
of
sitting
in
parliament
for
the
neighbouring
borough
and
the
poor
lad
had
evidently
been
bragging
on
the
subject
to
costigan
and
the
lady
of
his
affections
fairoaks
park
my
dear
sir
he
said
do
you
know
our
history
we
are
of
excessively
ancient
family
certainly
but
i
began
life
with
scarce
enough
money
to
purchase
my
commission
and
my
eldest
brother
was
a
country
apothecary
who
made
every
shilling
he
died
possessed
of
out
of
his
pestle
and
i
have
consented
to
waive
that
objection
sir
said
costigan
majestically
in
consideration
of
the
known
respectability
of
your
curse
your
impudence
thought
the
major
but
he
only
smiled
and
bowed
the
costigans
too
have
met
with
misfortunes
and
our
house
of
castle
costigan
is
by
no
manes
what
it
was
i
have
known
very
honest
men
apothecaries
sir
and
there
some
in
dublin
that
has
had
the
honour
of
dining
at
the
lord
leftenant
you
are
very
kind
to
give
us
the
benefit
of
your
charity
the
major
continued
but
permit
me
to
say
that
is
not
the
question
you
spoke
just
now
of
my
little
nephew
as
heir
of
fairoaks
park
and
i
do
know
what
funded
property
i
no
doubt
meejor
and
something
handsome
eventually
from
my
good
sir
i
tell
you
the
boy
is
the
son
of
a
country
apothecary
cried
out
major
pendennis
and
that
when
he
comes
of
age
he
wo
have
a
pooh
major
you
laughing
at
me
said
costigan
me
young
friend
i
make
no
doubt
is
heir
to
two
thousand
pounds
a
two
thousand
fiddlesticks
i
beg
your
pardon
my
dear
sir
but
has
the
boy
been
humbugging
you
it
is
not
his
habit
upon
my
word
and
honour
as
a
gentleman
and
an
executor
to
my
brother
will
too
he
left
little
more
than
five
hundred
a
year
behind
and
with
aconomy
a
handsome
sum
of
money
too
sir
the
captain
answered
faith
i
known
a
man
drink
his
and
drive
his
on
five
hundred
a
year
and
strict
aconomy
in
ireland
sir
we
manage
on
it
sir
trust
jack
costigan
for
my
dear
captain
costigan
i
give
you
my
word
that
my
brother
did
not
leave
a
shilling
to
his
son
are
ye
joking
with
me
meejor

cried
jack
costigan
are
ye
thrifling
with
the
feelings
of
a
father
and
a
gentleman
i
am
telling
you
the
honest
truth
said
major
pendennis
every
shilling
my
brother
had
he
left
to
his
widow
with
a
partial
reversion
it
is
true
to
the
boy
but
she
is
a
young
woman
and
may
marry
if
he
offends
her
or
she
may
outlive
him
for
she
comes
of
an
uncommonly
family
and
i
ask
you
as
a
gentleman
and
a
man
of
the
world
what
allowance
can
my
sister
pendennis
make
to
her
son
out
of
five
hundred
a
year
which
is
all
her
fortune
that
shall
enable
him
to
maintain
himself
and
your
daughter
in
the
rank
befitting
such
an
accomplished
young
lady
am
i
to
understand
sir
that

young
gentleman

nephew
and
whom
i
have
fosthered
and
cherished
as
the
son
of
me
bosom
is
an
imposther
who
has
been
thrifling
with
the
affections
of
me
beloved
child
exclaimed
the
general
with
an
outbreak
of
have
you
yourself
been
working
upon
the
feelings
of
the
young
man
susceptible
nature
to
injuice
him
to
break
off
an
engagement
and
with
it
me
adored
emily
heart
have
a
care
sir
how

thrifle
with
the
honour
of
john

thought

blood
sir
were
he
old
or
mr
costigan
cried
out
the
major
mr
costigan

protect
his
own
and
his
daughter
honour
and
will
sir
said
the
other
look
at
that
chest
of
dthrawers
it
contains
heaps
of
letthers
that
that
viper
has
addressed
to
that
innocent
child
there
promises
there
sir
enough
to
fill
a
bandbox
with
and
when
i
have
dragged
the
scoundthrel
before
the
courts
of
law
and
shown
up
his
perjury
and
his
dishonour
i
have
another
remedy
in
yondther
mahogany
case
sir
which
shall
set
me
right
sir
with
any
individual
ye
mark
me
words
major
pendennis
with
any
individual
who
has
counselled
your
nephew
to
insult
a
soldier
and
a
gentleman
what
me
daughter
to
be
jilted
and
me
grey
hairs
dishonoured
by
an
apothecary
son
by
the
laws
of
heaven
sir
i
should
like
to
see
the
man
that
shall
do
i
am
to
understand
then
that
you
threaten
in
the
first
place
to
publish
the
letters
of
a
boy
of
eighteen
to
a
woman
of
and
afterwards
to
do
me
the
honour
of
calling
me
out
the
major
said
still
with
perfect
coolness
you
have
described
my
intentions
with
perfect
accuracy
meejor
pendennis
answered
the
captain
as
he
pulled
his
ragged
whiskers
over
his
chin
well
well
these
shall
be
the
subjects
of
future
arrangements
but
before
we
come
to
powder
and
ball
my
good
sir
do
have
the
kindness
to
think
with
yourself
in
what
earthly
way
i
have
injured
you
i
have
told
you
that
my
nephew
is
dependent
upon
his
mother
who
has
scarcely
more
than
five
hundred
a
i
have
my
own
opinion
of
the
correctness
of
that
assertion
said
the
captain
will
you
go
to
my
sister
lawyers
tatham
here
and
satisfy
yourself
i
decline
to
meet
those
gentlemen
said
the
captain
with
rather
a
disturbed
air
if
it
be
as
you
say
i
have
been
athrociously
deceived
by
some
one
and
on
that
person
i
be
is
it
my
nephew
cried
the
major
starting
up
and
putting
on
his
hat
did
he
ever
tell
you
that
his
property
was
two
thousand
a
year
if
he
did
i
mistaken
in
the
boy
to
tell
lies
has
not
been
a
habit
in
our
family
costigan
and
i
do
think
my
brother
son
has
learned
it
as
yet
try
and
consider
whether
you
have
not
deceived
yourself
or
adopted
extravagant
reports
from
hearsay
as
for
me
sir
you
are
at
liberty
to
understand
that
i
am
not
afraid
of
all
the
costigans
in
ireland
and
know
quite
well
how
to
defend
myself
against
any
threats
from
any
quarter
i
come
here
as
the
boy
guardian
to
protest
against
a
marriage
most
absurd
and
unequal
that
can
not
but
bring
poverty
and
misery
with
it
and
in
preventing
it
i
conceive
i
am
quite
as
much
your
daughter
friend
who
i
have
no
doubt
is
an
honourable
young
lady
as
the
friend
of
my
own
family
and
prevent
the
marriage
i
will
sir
by
every
means
in
my
power
there
i
have
said
my
say
but
i
have
not
said
mine
major
pendennis
and
ye
shall
hear
more
from
me
costigan
said
with
a
look
of
tremendous
severity
sir
what
do
you
mean
the
major
asked
turning
round
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
and
looking
the
intrepid
costigan
in
the
face
ye
said
in
the
coorse
of
conversation
that
ye
were
at
the
george
hotel
i
think
costigan
said
in
a
stately
manner
a
friend
shall
wait
upon
ye
there
before
ye
leave
town
let
him
make
haste
costigan
cried
out
the
major
almost
beside
himself
with
rage
i
wish
you
a
good
morning
and
captain
costigan
bowed
a
magnificent
bow
of
defiance
to
major
pendennis
over
the
as
the
latter
retreated
down
the
stairs
chapter
xii
in
which
a
shooting
match
is
proposed
early
mention
has
been
made
in
this
history
of
garbetts
principal
tragedian
a
promising
and
athletic
young
actor
of
jovial
habits
and
irregular
inclinations
between
whom
and
costigan
there
was
a
considerable
intimacy
they
were
the
chief
ornaments
of
the
convivial
club
held
at
the
magpie
hotel
they
helped
each
other
in
various
bill
transactions
in
which
they
had
been
engaged
with
the
mutual
loan
of
each
other
valuable
signatures
they
were
friends
in
fine
although
garbetts
seldom
called
at
costigan
house
being
disliked
by
miss
fotheringay
of
whom
in
her
turn
garbetts
was
considerably
jealous
the
truth
is
that
garbetts
had
paid
his
court
to
miss
fotheringay
and
been
refused
by
her
before
he
offered
his
hand
to
their
history
however
forms
no
part
of
our
present
scheme
suffice
it
garbetts
was
called
in
by
captain
costigan
immediately
after
his
daughter
and
bows
had
quitted
the
house
as
a
friend
proper
to
be
consulted
at
the
actual
juncture
he
was
a
large
man
with
a
loud
voice
and
fierce
aspect
who
had
the
finest
legs
of
the
whole
company
and
could
break
a
poker
in
mere
sport
across
his
stalwart
arm
run
tommy
said
costigan
to
the
little
messenger
and
fetch
garbetts
from
his
lodgings
over
the
tripe
shop
ye
know
and
tell
to
send
two
glasses
of
hot
from
the
so
tommy
went
his
way
and
presently
garbetts
and
the
whisky
came
captain
costigan
did
not
disclose
to
him
the
whole
of
the
previous
events
of
which
the
reader
is
in
possession
but
with
the
aid
of
the
he
composed
a
letter
of
a
threatening
nature
to
major
pendennis
address
in
which
he
called
upon
that
gentleman
to
offer
no
hindrance
to
the
marriage
projected
between
arthur
pendennis
and
his
daughter
miss
fotheringay
and
to
fix
an
early
day
for
its
celebration
or
in
any
other
case
to
give
him
the
satisfaction
which
was
usual
between
gentlemen
of
honour
and
should
major
pendennis
be
disinclined
to
this
alternative
the
captain
hinted
that
he
would
force
him
to
accept
by
the
use
of
a
horsewhip
which
he
should
employ
upon
the
major
person
the
precise
terms
of
this
letter
we
can
not
give
for
reasons
which
shall
be
specified
presently
but
it
was
no
doubt
couched
in
the
captain
finest
style
and
sealed
elaborately
with
the
great
silver
seal
of
the
costigans
the
only
bit
of
the
family
plate
which
the
captain
possessed
garbetts
was
despatched
then
with
this
message
and
letter
and
bidding
heaven
bless
the
general
squeezed
his
ambassador
hand
and
saw
him
depart
then
he
took
down
his
venerable
and
murderous
with
flint
locks
that
had
done
the
business
of
many
a
pretty
fellow
in
dublin
and
having
examined
these
and
seen
that
they
were
in
a
satisfactory
condition
he
brought
from
the
drawer
all
pen
letters
and
poems
which
he
kept
there
and
which
he
always
read
before
he
permitted
his
emily
to
enjoy
their
perusal
in
a
score
of
minutes
garbetts
came
back
with
an
anxious
and
crestfallen
countenance
ye
seen
the
captain
said
why
yes
said
garbetts
and
when
is
it
for
asked
costigan
trying
the
lock
of
one
of
the
ancient
pistols
and
bringing
it
to
a
level
with
his
oi
as
he
called
that
bloodshot
orb
when
is
what
for
asked
garbetts
the
meeting
my
dear
fellow
you
do
mean
to
say
you
mean
mortal
combat
captain
garbetts
said
aghast
what
the
devil
else
do
i
mean
garbetts
i
want
to
shoot
that
man
that
has
trajuiced
me
honor
or
meself
dthrop
a
victim
on
the
d
if
i
carry
challenges
garbetts
replied
i
a
family
man
captain
and
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
pistols
take
back
your
letter
and
to
the
surprise
and
indignation
of
captain
costigan
his
emissary
flung
the
letter
down
with
its
great
sprawling
superscription
and
blotched
seal
ye
do
mean
to
say
ye
saw
and
did
give
the
letter
cried
out
the
captain
in
a
fury
i
saw
him
but
i
could
not
have
speech
with
him
captain
said
garbetts
and
why
the
devil
not
asked
the
other
there
was
one
there
i
cared
not
to
meet
nor
would
you
the
tragedian
answered
in
a
sepulchral
voice
the
minion
tatham
was
there
the
cowardly
scoundthrel
roared
costigan
he
frightened
and
already
going
to
swear
the
peace
against
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
fighting
mark
that
the
tragedian
doggedly
said
and
i
wish
i
not
seen
tatham
neither
nor
that
bit
of
hold
your
tongue
bob
acres
it
my
belief
ye
no
better
than
a
coward
said
captain
costigan
quoting
sir
lucius
which
character
he
had
performed
with
credit
both
off
and
on
the
stage
and
after
some
more
parley
between
the
couple
they
separated
in
not
very
good
humour
their
colloquy
has
been
here
condensed
as
the
reader
knows
the
main
point
upon
which
it
turned
but
the
latter
will
now
see
how
it
is
impossible
to
give
a
correct
account
of
the
letter
which
the
captain
wrote
to
major
pendennis
as
it
was
never
opened
at
all
by
that
gentleman
when
miss
costigan
came
home
from
rehearsal
which
she
did
in
the
company
of
the
faithful
bows
she
found
her
father
pacing
up
and
down
their
apartment
in
a
great
state
of
agitation
and
in
the
midst
of
a
powerful
odour
of
which
as
it
appeared
had
not
succeeded
in
pacifying
his
disordered
mind
the
pendennis
papers
were
on
the
table
surrounding
the
empty
goblets
and
now
useless
teaspoon
which
had
served
to
hold
and
mix
the
captain
liquor
and
his
friend
as
emily
entered
he
seized
her
in
his
arms
and
cried
out
prepare
yourself
me
child
me
blessed
child
in
a
voice
of
agony
and
with
eyes
brimful
of
tears
ye
tipsy
again
papa
miss
fotheringay
said
pushing
back
her
sire
ye
promised
me
ye
would
take
spirits
before
it
to
forget
me
sorrows
me
poor
girl
that
i
taken
just
a
drop
cried
the
bereaved
father
it
to
drown
me
care
that
i
drain
the
your
care
takes
a
deal
of
drowning
captain
dear
said
bows
mimicking
his
friend
accent
what
has
happened
has
that
gentleman
in
the
wig
been
vexing
you
the
oily
miscreant
i
have
his
blood
roared
miss
milly
it
must
be
premised
had
fled
to
her
room
out
of
his
embrace
and
was
taking
off
her
bonnet
and
shawl
there
i
thought
he
meant
mischief
he
was
so
uncommon
civil
the
other
said
what
has
he
come
to
say
o
bows
he
has
overwhellum
me
the
captain
said
there
a
hellish
conspiracy
on
foot
against
me
poor
girl
and
it
me
opinion
that
both
them
pendennises
nephew
and
uncle
is
two
infernal
thrators
and
scoundthrels
who
should
be
conshumed
from
off
the
face
of
the
what
is
it
what
has
happened
said
bows
growing
rather
excited
costigan
then
told
him
the
major
statement
that
the
young
pendennis
had
not
two
thousand
nor
two
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
expressed
his
fury
that
he
should
have
permitted
such
an
impostor
to
coax
and
wheedle
his
innocent
girl
and
that
he
should
have
nourished
such
a
viper
in
his
own
personal
bosom
i
have
shaken
the
reptile
from
me
however
said
costigan
and
as
for
his
uncle
i
have
such
a
revenge
on
that
old
man
as
shall
make
rue
the
day
he
ever
insulted
a
what
do
you
mean
general
said
bows
i
mean
to
have
his
life
bows
his
villanous
skulking
life
my
boy
and
he
rapped
upon
the
battered
old
in
an
ominous
and
savage
manner
bows
had
often
heard
him
appeal
to
that
box
of
death
with
which
he
proposed
to
sacrifice
his
enemies
but
the
captain
did
not
tell
him
that
he
had
actually
written
and
sent
a
challenge
to
major
pendennis
and
bows
therefore
rather
disregarded
the
pistols
in
the
present
instance
at
this
juncture
miss
fotheringay
returned
to
the
common
from
her
private
apartment
looking
perfectly
healthy
happy
and
unconcerned
a
striking
and
wholesome
contrast
to
her
father
who
was
in
a
delirious
tremor
of
grief
anger
and
other
agitation
she
brought
in
a
pair
of
satin
shoes
with
her
which
she
proposed
to
rub
as
clean
as
might
be
with
intending
to
go
mad
with
them
upon
next
tuesday
evening
in
ophelia
in
which
character
she
was
to
reappear
on
that
night
she
looked
at
the
papers
on
the
table
stopped
as
if
she
was
going
to
ask
a
question
but
thought
better
of
it
and
going
to
the
cupboard
selected
an
eligible
piece
of
bread
wherewith
she
might
operate
on
the
satin
slippers
and
afterwards
coming
back
to
the
table
seated
herself
there
commodiously
with
the
shoes
and
then
asked
her
father
in
her
honest
irish
brogue
what
have
ye
got
them
letthers
and
pothry
and
stuff
of
master
arthur
out
for
pa
sure
ye
do
want
to
be
reading
over
that
o
emilee
cried
the
captain
that
boy
whom
i
loved
as
the
boy
of
mee
bosom
is
only
a
scoundthrel
and
a
deceiver
mee
poor
girl
and
he
looked
in
the
most
tragical
way
at
bows
opposite
who
in
his
turn
gazed
somewhat
anxiously
at
miss
costigan
he
pooh
sure
the
poor
lad
as
simple
as
a
schoolboy
she
said
all
them
children
write
verses
and
he
been
acting
the
part
of
a
viper
to
this
fireside
and
a
traitor
in
this
familee
cried
the
captain
i
tell
ye
he
no
better
than
an
what
has
the
poor
fellow
done
papa
asked
emily
done
he
has
deceived
us
in
the
most
athrocious
manner
miss
papa
said
he
has
thrifled
with
your
affections
and
outraged
my
own
fine
feelings
he
has
represented
himself
as
a
man
of
property
and
it
turruns
out
that
he
is
no
betther
than
a
beggar
have
i
often
told
ye
he
had
two
thousand
a
year
he
a
pauper
i
tell
ye
miss
costigan
a
depindent
upon
the
bountee
of
his
mother
a
good
woman
who
may
marry
again
who
likely
to
live
for
ever
and
who
has
but
five
hundred
a
year
how
dar
he
ask
ye
to
marry
into
a
family
which
has
not
the
means
of
providing
for
ye
ye
been
grossly
deceived
and
put
upon
milly
and
it
my
belief
his
old
ruffian
of
an
uncle
in
a
wig
is
in
the
plot
against
that
soft
old
gentleman
what
has
he
been
doing
papa
continued
emily
still
imperturbable
costigan
informed
milly
that
when
she
was
gone
major
pendennis
told
him
in
his
pall
mall
polite
manner
that
young
arthur
had
no
fortune
at
all
that
the
major
had
asked
him
costigan
to
go
to
the
lawyers
wherein
he
knew
the
scoundthrels
have
a
bill
of
mine
and
i
ca
meet
them
the
captain
parenthetically
remarked
and
see
the
lad
father
will
and
finally
that
an
infernal
swindle
had
been
practised
upon
him
by
the
pair
and
that
he
was
resolved
either
on
a
marriage
or
on
the
blood
of
both
of
them
milly
looked
very
grave
and
thoughtful
rubbing
the
white
satin
shoes
sure
if
he
no
money
there
no
use
marrying
him
papa
she
said
sententiously
why
did
the
villain
say
he
was
a
man
of
prawpertee
asked
costigan
the
poor
fellow
always
said
he
was
poor
answered
the
girl
was
you
would
have
it
he
was
rich
papa
and
made
me
agree
to
take
he
should
have
been
explicit
and
told
us
his
income
milly
answered
the
father
a
young
fellow
who
rides
a
blood
mare
and
makes
presents
of
shawls
and
bracelets
is
an
impostor
if
he
has
no
money
and
as
for
his
uncle
bedad
i
pull
off
his
wig
whenever
i
see
bows
here
shall
take
a
message
to
him
and
tell
him
so
either
it
a
marriage
or
he
meets
me
in
the
field
like
a
man
or
i
tweak
on
the
nose
in
front
of
his
hotel
or
in
the
gravel
walks
of
fairoaks
park
before
all
the
county
bedad
you
may
send
somebody
else
with
the
message
said
bows
laughing
i
a
fiddler
not
a
fighting
man
pooh
you
no
spirit
sir
roared
the
general
i
be
my
own
second
if
no
one
will
stand
by
and
see
me
injured
and
i
take
my
case
of
pistols
and
shoot
in
the
of
the
and
so
poor
arthur
has
no
money
sighed
out
miss
costigan
rather
plaintively
poor
lad
he
was
a
good
lad
too
wild
and
talking
nonsense
with
his
verses
and
pothry
and
that
but
a
brave
generous
boy
and
indeed
i
liked
him
and
he
liked
me
too
she
added
rather
softly
and
rubbing
away
at
the
shoe
why
do
you
marry
him
if
you
like
him
so
bows
said
rather
savagely
he
is
not
more
than
ten
years
younger
than
you
are
his
mother
may
relent
and
you
might
go
and
live
and
have
enough
at
fairoaks
park
why
not
go
and
be
a
lady
i
could
go
on
with
the
fiddle
and
the
general
live
on
his
why
do
you
marry
him
you
know
he
likes
there
others
that
likes
me
as
well
bows
that
has
no
money
and
that
old
enough
miss
milly
said
sententiously
yes
d
it
said
bows
with
a
bitter
curse
that
are
old
enough
and
poor
enough
and
fools
enough
for
there
old
fools
and
young
fools
too
you
often
said
so
you
silly
man
the
imperious
beauty
said
with
a
conscious
glance
at
the
old
gentleman
if
pendennis
has
not
enough
money
to
live
upon
it
folly
to
talk
about
marrying
him
and
that
the
long
and
short
of
and
the
boy
said
bows
by
jove
you
throw
a
man
away
like
an
old
glove
miss
i
do
know
what
you
mean
bows
said
miss
fotheringay
placidly
rubbing
the
second
shoe
if
he
had
had
half
of
the
two
thousand
a
year
that
papa
gave
him
or
the
half
of
that
i
would
marry
him
but
what
is
the
good
of
taking
on
with
a
beggar
we
poor
enough
already
no
use
in
my
going
to
live
with
an
old
lady
that
testy
and
cross
maybe
and
would
grudge
me
every
morsel
of
sure
it
near
dinner
time
and
suky
not
laid
the
cloth
yet
and
then
added
miss
costigan
quite
simply
suppose
there
was
a
family
why
papa
we
should
be
as
well
off
as
we
are
then
you
would
not
milly
dear
answered
the
father
and
there
an
end
to
all
the
fine
talk
about
arthur
pendennis
of
fairoaks
park
the
member
of
parliament
lady
said
milly
with
a
laugh
pretty
carriages
and
horses
we
should
have
to
ride
that
you
were
always
talking
about
papa
but
it
always
the
same
if
a
man
looked
at
me
you
fancied
he
was
going
to
marry
me
and
if
he
had
a
good
coat
you
fancied
he
was
as
rich
as
as
croesus
said
bows
well
call
what
ye
like
but
it
a
fact
now
that
papa
has
married
me
these
eight
years
a
score
of
times
was
i
to
be
my
lady
poldoody
of
oystherstown
castle
then
there
was
the
navy
captain
at
portsmouth
and
the
old
surgeon
at
norwich
and
the
methodist
preacher
here
last
year
and
who
knows
how
many
more
well
i
bet
a
penny
with
all
your
scheming
i
shall
die
milly
costigan
at
last
so
poor
little
arthur
has
no
money
stop
and
take
dinner
bows
we
a
beautiful
i
wonder
whether
she
is
on
with
sir
derby
oaks
thought
bows
whose
eyes
and
thoughts
were
always
watching
her
the
dodges
of
women
beat
all
comprehension
and
i
am
sure
she
would
let
the
lad
off
so
easily
if
she
had
not
some
other
scheme
on
it
will
have
been
perceived
that
miss
fotheringay
though
silent
in
general
and
by
no
means
brilliant
as
a
conversationist
where
poetry
literature
or
the
fine
arts
were
concerned
could
talk
freely
and
with
good
sense
too
in
her
own
family
circle
she
can
not
justly
be
called
a
romantic
person
nor
were
her
literary
acquirement
great
she
never
opened
a
shakspeare
from
the
day
she
left
the
stage
nor
indeed
understood
it
during
all
the
time
she
adorned
the
boards
but
about
a
pudding
a
piece
of
or
her
own
domestic
affairs
she
was
as
good
a
judge
as
could
be
found
and
not
being
misled
by
a
strong
imagination
or
a
passionate
temper
was
better
enabled
to
keep
her
judgment
cool
when
over
their
dinner
costigan
tried
to
convince
himself
and
the
company
that
the
major
statement
regarding
pen
finances
was
unworthy
of
credit
and
a
mere
ruse
upon
the
old
hypocrite
part
so
as
to
induce
them
on
their
side
to
break
off
the
match
miss
milly
would
not
for
a
moment
admit
the
possibility
of
deceit
on
the
side
of
the
adversary
and
pointed
out
clearly
that
it
was
her
father
who
had
deceived
himself
and
not
poor
little
pen
who
had
tried
to
take
them
in
as
for
that
poor
lad
she
said
she
pitied
him
with
all
her
heart
and
she
ate
an
exceedingly
good
dinner
to
the
admiration
of
bows
who
had
a
remarkable
regard
and
contempt
for
this
woman
during
and
after
which
repast
the
party
devised
upon
the
best
means
of
bringing
this
to
a
close
as
for
costigan
his
idea
of
tweaking
the
major
nose
vanished
with
his
supply
of
and
he
was
submissive
to
his
daughter
and
ready
for
any
plan
on
which
she
might
decide
in
order
to
meet
the
crisis
which
she
saw
was
at
hand
the
captain
who
as
long
as
he
had
a
notion
that
he
was
wronged
was
eager
to
face
and
demolish
both
pen
and
his
uncle
perhaps
shrank
from
the
idea
of
meeting
the
former
and
asked
what
the
juice
they
were
to
say
to
the
lad
if
he
remained
steady
to
his
engagement
and
they
broke
from
theirs
what
do
you
know
how
to
throw
a
man
over
said
bows
ask
a
woman
to
tell
you
and
miss
fotheringay
showed
how
this
feat
was
to
be
done
simply
enough
nothing
was
more
easy
papa
writes
to
arthur
to
know
what
settlements
he
proposes
to
make
in
event
of
a
marriage
and
asks
what
his
means
are
arthur
writes
back
and
says
what
he
got
and
you
find
it
as
the
major
says
i
go
bail
then
papa
writes
and
says
it
not
enough
and
the
match
had
best
be
at
an
and
of
course
you
enclose
a
parting
line
in
which
you
say
you
will
always
regard
him
as
a
brother
said
bows
eyeing
her
in
his
scornful
way
of
course
and
so
i
shall
answered
miss
fotheringay
he
a
most
worthy
young
man
i
sure
i
thank
ye
hand
me
the
salt
them
filberts
is
and
there
will
be
no
noses
pulled
cos
my
boy
i

bows

and
full
of

of
nonsense
and
latin
and
things
i
understand
the
half
of
indeed
i
not
read
all
but
we
send
back
to
him
when
the
proper
time
and
going
to
a
drawer
miss
fotheringay
took
out
from
it
a
number
of
the
county
chronicle
and
chatteris
champion
in
which
pen
had
written
a
copy
of
flaming
verses
celebrating
her
appearance
in
the
character
of
imogen
and
putting
by
the
leaf
upon
which
the
poem
appeared
for
like
ladies
of
her
profession
she
kept
the
favourable
printed
notices
of
her
performances
she
wrapped
up
pen
letters
poems
passions
and
fancies
and
tied
them
with
a
piece
of
string
neatly
as
she
would
a
parcel
of
sugar
nor
was
she
in
the
least
moved
while
performing
this
act
what
hours
the
boy
had
passed
over
those
papers
what
love
and
longing
what
generous
faith
and
manly
devotion
what
watchful
nights
and
lonely
fevers
might
they
tell
of
she
tied
them
up
like
so
much
grocery
and
sate
down
and
made
tea
afterwards
with
a
perfectly
placid
and
contented
heart
while
pen
was
yearning
after
her
ten
miles
off
and
hugging
her
image
to
his
soul
chapter
xiii
a
crisis
meanwhile
they
were
wondering
at
fairoaks
that
the
major
had
not
returned
portman
and
his
lady
on
their
way
home
to
clavering
stopped
at
helen
with
a
brief
note
for
her
from
major
pendennis
in
which
he
said
he
should
remain
at
chatteris
another
day
being
anxious
to
have
some
talk
with
tatham
the
lawyers
whom
he
would
meet
that
afternoon
but
no
mention
was
made
of
the
transaction
in
which
the
writer
had
been
engaged
during
the
morning
indeed
the
note
was
written
at
the
pause
after
the
first
part
of
the
engagement
and
when
the
major
had
decidedly
had
the
worst
of
the
battle
pen
did
not
care
somehow
to
go
into
the
town
whilst
his
uncle
was
there
he
did
not
like
to
have
to
fancy
that
his
guardian
might
be
spying
at
him
from
that
abominable
dean
whilst
he
was
making
love
in
miss
costigan
and
the
pleasures
of
a
walk
a
delight
which
he
was
very
rarely
permitted
to
enjoy
would
have
been
spoiled
if
he
had
met
the
man
of
the
polished
boots
on
that
occasion
his
modest
love
could
not
show
in
public
by
any
outward
signs
except
the
eyes
with
which
the
poor
fellow
ogled
and
gazed
violently
to
be
sure
but
it
was
dumb
in
the
presence
of
third
parties
and
so
much
the
better
for
of
all
the
talk
which
takes
place
in
this
world
that
of
is
surely
to
the
uninitiated
the
most
silly
it
is
the
vocabulary
without
the
key
it
is
the
lamp
without
the
flame
let
the
respected
reader
look
or
think
over
some
old
that
he
or
she
has
had
and
forgotten
and
try
them
over
again
how
blank
and
meaningless
they
seem
what
glamour
of
infatuation
was
it
which
made
that
nonsense
beautiful
one
wonders
that
such
puling
and
trash
could
ever
have
made
one
happy
and
yet
there
were
dates
when
you
kissed
those
silly
letters
with
rapture
lived
upon
six
absurd
lines
for
a
week
and
until
the
reactionary
period
came
when
you
were
restless
and
miserable
until
you
got
a
fresh
supply
of
folly
that
is
why
we
decline
to
publish
any
of
the
letters
and
verses
which
mr
pen
wrote
at
this
period
of
his
life
out
of
mere
regard
for
the
young
fellow
character
they
are
too
spooney
and
wild
young
ladies
ought
not
to
be
called
upon
to
read
them
in
cold
blood
bide
your
time
young
women
perhaps
you
will
get
and
write
them
on
your
own
account
soon
meanwhile
we
will
respect
mr
pen
first
outpourings
and
keep
them
tied
up
in
the
newspapers
with
miss
fotheringay
string
and
sealed
with
captain
costigan
great
silver
seal
the
major
came
away
from
his
interview
with
captain
costigan
in
a
state
of
such
concentrated
fury
as
rendered
him
terrible
to
approach
the
impudent
scamp
he
thought
dare
to
threaten
me
dare
to
talk
of
permitting
his
damned
costigans
to
marry
with
the
pendennises
send
me
a
challenge
if
the
fellow
can
get
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
gentleman
to
carry
it
i
have
the
greatest
mind
in
life
not
to
baulk
psha
what
would
people
say
if
i
were
to
go
out
with
a
tipsy
mountebank
about
a
row
with
an
actress
in
a
barn
so
when
the
major
saw
portman
who
asked
anxiously
regarding
the
issue
of
his
battle
with
the
dragon
pendennis
did
not
care
to
inform
the
divine
of
the
general
insolent
behaviour
but
stated
that
the
affair
was
a
very
ugly
and
disagreeable
one
and
that
it
was
by
no
means
over
yet
he
enjoined
doctor
and
portman
to
say
nothing
about
the
business
at
fairoaks
whither
he
contented
himself
with
despatching
the
note
we
have
before
mentioned
and
then
he
returned
to
his
hotel
where
he
vented
his
wrath
upon
morgan
his
valet
dammin
and
cussin
upstairs
and
downstairs
as
that
gentleman
observed
to
foker
man
in
whose
company
he
partook
of
dinner
in
the
servants
room
of
the
george
the
servant
carried
the
news
to
his
master
and
foker
having
finished
his
breakfast
about
this
time
it
being
two
in
the
afternoon
remembered
that
he
was
anxious
to
know
the
result
of
the
interview
between
his
two
friends
and
having
inquired
the
number
of
the
major
went
over
in
his
brocade
and
knocked
for
admission
major
pendennis
had
some
business
as
he
had
stated
respecting
a
lease
of
the
widow
about
which
he
was
desirous
of
consulting
old
tatham
the
lawyer
who
had
been
his
brother
man
of
business
and
who
had
a
at
clavering
where
he
and
his
son
attended
market
and
other
days
three
or
four
in
the
week
this
gentleman
and
his
client
were
now
in
consultation
when
foker
showed
his
grand
and
embroidered
at
major
pendennis
door
seeing
the
major
engaged
with
papers
and
and
an
old
man
with
a
white
head
the
modest
youth
was
for
drawing
back
and
said
o
busy
call
again
another
but
pendennis
wanted
to
see
him
and
begged
him
with
a
smile
to
enter
whereupon
foker
took
off
the
embroidered
tarboosh
or
fez
it
had
been
worked
by
the
fondest
of
mothers
and
advanced
bowing
to
the
gentlemen
and
smiling
on
them
graciously
tatham
had
never
seen
so
splendid
an
apparition
before
as
this
brocaded
youth
who
seated
himself
in
an
spreading
out
his
crimson
skirts
and
looking
with
exceeding
kindness
and
frankness
on
the
other
two
tenants
of
the
room
you
seem
to
like
my
sir
he
said
to
tatham
a
pretty
thing
is
it
neat
but
not
in
the
least
gaudy
and
how
do
you
do
major
pendennis
sir
and
how
does
the
world
treat
you
there
was
that
in
foker
manner
and
appearance
which
would
have
put
an
inquisitor
into
good
humour
and
it
smoothed
the
wrinkles
under
pendennis
head
of
hair
i
have
had
an
interview
with
that
irishman
you
may
speak
before
my
friend
tatham
here
who
knows
all
the
affairs
of
the
family
and
it
has
not
i
own
been
very
satisfactory
he
wo
believe
that
my
nephew
is
poor
he
says
we
are
both
liars
he
did
me
the
honour
to
hint
that
i
was
a
coward
as
i
took
leave
and
i
thought
when
you
knocked
at
the
door
that
you
might
be
the
gentleman
whom
i
expect
with
a
challenge
from
costigan
that
is
how
the
world
treats
me
you
do
mean
that
irishman
the
actress
father
cried
tatham
who
was
a
dissenter
himself
and
did
not
patronise
the
drama
that
irishman
the
actress
father
the
very
man
have
not
you
heard
what
a
fool
my
nephew
has
made
of
himself
about
the
girl
tatham
who
never
entered
the
walls
of
a
theatre
had
heard
nothing
and
major
pendennis
had
to
recount
the
story
of
his
nephew
loves
to
the
lawyer
foker
coming
in
with
appropriate
comments
in
his
usual
familiar
language
tatham
was
lost
in
wonder
at
the
narrative
why
had
not
pendennis
married
a
serious
man
he
thought
tatham
was
a
widower
and
kept
this
unfortunate
boy
from
perdition
as
for
costigan
daughter
he
would
say
nothing
her
profession
was
sufficient
to
characterise
her
foker
here
interposed
to
say
he
had
known
some
uncommon
good
people
in
the
booths
as
he
called
the
temple
of
the
muses
well
it
might
be
so
tatham
hoped
so
but
the
father
tatham
knew
personally
a
man
of
the
worst
character
a
and
an
idler
in
taverns
and
and
a
notorious
insolvent
i
can
understand
the
reason
major
he
said
why
the
fellow
would
not
come
to
my
office
to
ascertain
the
truth
of
the
statements
which
you
made
we
have
a
writ
out
against
him
and
another
disreputable
fellow
one
of
the
for
a
bill
given
to
skinner
of
this
city
a
most
respectable
grocer
and
wine
and
spirit
merchant
and
a
member
of
the
society
of
friends
this
costigan
came
crying
to
skinner
crying
in
the
shop
sir
and
we
have
not
proceeded
against
him
or
the
other
as
neither
were
worth
powder
and
it
was
whilst
tatham
was
engaged
in
telling
this
story
that
a
third
knock
came
to
the
door
and
there
entered
an
athletic
gentleman
in
a
shabby
braided
frock
bearing
in
his
hand
a
letter
with
a
large
blotched
red
seal
can
i
have
the
honour
of
speaking
with
major
pendennis
in
private
he
began
i
have
a
few
words
for
your
ear
sir
i
am
the
bearer
of
a
mission
from
my
friend
captain
costigan
but
here
the
man
with
the
bass
voice
paused
faltered
and
turned
pale
he
caught
sight
of
the
red
and
face
of
tatham
hullo
garbetts
speak
up
cried
foker
delighted
why
bless
my
soul
it
is
the
other
party
to
the
bill
said
tatham
i
say
sir
stop
i
but
garbetts
with
a
face
as
blank
as
macbeth
when
banquo
ghost
appears
upon
him
gasped
some
inarticulate
words
and
fled
out
of
the
room
the
major
gravity
was
also
entirely
upset
and
he
burst
out
laughing
so
did
foker
who
said
by
jove
it
was
a
good
so
did
the
attorney
although
by
profession
a
serious
man
i
do
think
there
be
any
fight
major
young
foker
said
and
began
mimicking
the
tragedian
if
there
is
the
old
gentleman
your
name
tatham
very
happy
to
make
your
acquaintance
tatham
may
send
the
bailiffs
to
separate
the
men
and
tatham
promised
to
do
so
the
major
was
by
no
means
sorry
at
the
ludicrous
issue
of
the
quarrel
it
seems
to
me
sir
he
said
to
foker
that
you
always
arrive
to
put
me
into
nor
was
this
the
only
occasion
on
which
foker
this
day
was
destined
to
be
of
service
to
the
pendennis
family
we
have
said
that
he
had
the
entree
of
captain
costigan
lodgings
and
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
he
thought
he
would
pay
the
general
a
visit
and
hear
from
his
own
lips
what
had
occurred
in
the
conversation
in
the
morning
with
pendennis
captain
costigan
was
not
at
home
he
had
received
permission
nay
encouragement
from
his
daughter
to
go
to
the
convivial
club
at
the
magpie
hotel
where
no
doubt
he
was
bragging
at
that
moment
of
his
desire
to
murder
a
certain
ruffian
for
he
was
not
only
brave
but
he
knew
it
too
and
liked
to
take
out
his
courage
and
as
it
were
give
it
an
airing
in
company
costigan
then
was
absent
but
miss
fotheringay
was
at
home
washing
the
whilst
bows
sate
opposite
to
her
just
done
breakfast
i
see
how
do
said
foker
popping
in
his
little
funny
head
get
out
you
funny
little
man
cried
miss
fotheringay
you
mean
come
in
answered
the
here
we
are
and
entering
the
room
he
folded
his
arms
and
began
twirling
his
head
round
and
round
with
immense
rapidity
like
harlequin
in
the
pantomime
when
he
first
issues
from
his
cocoon
or
envelope
miss
fotheringay
laughed
with
all
her
heart
a
wink
of
foker
would
set
her
off
laughing
when
the
bitterest
joke
bows
ever
made
could
not
get
a
smile
from
her
or
the
finest
of
poor
pen
speeches
would
only
puzzle
her
at
the
end
of
the
harlequinade
he
sank
down
on
one
knee
and
kissed
her
hand
you
the
drollest
little
man
she
said
and
gave
him
a
great
slap
pen
used
to
tremble
as
he
kissed
her
hand
pen
would
have
died
of
a
slap
these
preliminaries
over
the
three
began
to
talk
foker
amused
his
companions
by
recounting
to
them
the
scene
which
he
had
just
witnessed
of
the
discomfiture
of
garbetts
by
which
they
learned
for
the
first
time
how
far
the
general
had
carried
his
wrath
against
major
pendennis
foker
spoke
strongly
in
favour
of
the
major
character
for
veracity
and
honour
and
described
him
as
a
swell
moving
in
the
of
society
who
would
never
submit
to
any
deceit
much
more
to
deceive
such
a
charming
young
woman
as
miss
foth
he
touched
delicately
upon
the
delicate
marriage
question
though
he
could
help
showing
that
he
held
pen
rather
cheap
in
fact
he
had
a
perhaps
just
contempt
for
mr
pen
sentimentality
his
own
weakness
as
he
thought
not
lying
that
way
i
knew
it
would
do
miss
foth
said
he
nodding
his
little
head
could
do
did
like
to
put
my
hand
into
the
bag
but
knew
it
could
do
he
too
young
for
you
too
green
a
deal
too
green
and
he
turns
out
to
be
poor
as
job
ca
have
him
at
no
price
can
she
bo
indeed
he
a
nice
poor
boy
said
the
fotheringay
rather
sadly
poor
little
beggar
said
bows
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
stealing
up
a
queer
look
at
miss
fotheringay
perhaps
he
thought
and
wondered
at
the
way
in
which
women
play
with
men
and
coax
them
and
win
them
and
drop
them
but
bows
had
not
the
least
objection
to
acknowledge
that
he
thought
miss
fotheringay
was
perfectly
right
in
giving
up
arthur
pendennis
and
that
in
his
idea
the
match
was
always
an
absurd
one
and
miss
costigan
owned
that
she
thought
so
herself
only
she
could
send
away
two
thousand
a
year
it
all
comes
of
believing
papa
silly
stories
she
said
faith
i
choose
for
meself
another
time
and
very
likely
the
large
image
of
lieutenant
sir
derby
oaks
entered
into
her
mind
at
that
instant
after
praising
major
pendennis
whom
miss
costigan
declared
to
be
a
proper
gentleman
entirely
smelling
of
lavender
and
as
neat
as
a
pin
and
who
was
pronounced
by
bows
to
be
the
right
sort
of
fellow
though
rather
too
much
of
an
old
buck
foker
suddenly
bethought
him
to
ask
the
pair
to
come
and
meet
the
major
that
very
evening
at
dinner
at
his
apartment
at
the
george
he
agreed
to
dine
with
me
and
i
think
after
the
after
the
little
shindy
this
morning
in
which
i
must
say
the
general
was
wrong
it
would
look
kind
you
i
know
the
major
fell
in
love
with
you
miss
foth
he
said
so
she
may
be
pendennis
still
bows
said
with
a
sneer
no
thank
you
i
sure
that
was
at
three
said
miss
costigan
who
had
an
honest
appetite
and
i
ca
go
without
we
have
and
champagne
said
the
little
monster
who
could
not
construe
a
line
of
latin
or
do
a
sum
beyond
the
rule
of
three
now
for
and
champagne
in
an
honourable
manner
miss
costigan
would
have
gone
anywhere
and
major
pendennis
actually
found
himself
at
seven
seated
at
a
in
company
with
bows
a
professional
fiddler
and
miss
costigan
whose
father
had
wanted
to
blow
his
brains
out
a
few
hours
before
to
make
the
happy
meeting
complete
foker
who
knew
haunts
despatched
stoopid
to
the
club
at
the
magpie
where
the
general
was
in
the
act
of
singing
a
pathetic
song
and
brought
him
off
to
supper
to
find
his
daughter
and
bows
seated
at
the
board
was
a
surprise
indeed
major
pendennis
laughed
and
cordially
held
out
his
hand
which
the
general
officer
grasped
avec
effusion
as
the
french
say
in
fact
he
was
considerably
inebriated
and
had
already
been
crying
over
his
own
song
before
he
joined
the
little
party
at
the
george
he
burst
into
tears
more
than
once
during
the
entertainment
and
called
the
major
his
dearest
friend
stoopid
and
foker
walked
home
with
him
the
major
gallantly
giving
his
arm
to
miss
costigan
he
was
received
with
great
friendliness
when
he
called
the
next
day
when
many
civilities
passed
between
the
gentlemen
on
taking
leave
he
expressed
his
anxious
desire
to
serve
miss
costigan
on
any
occasion
in
which
he
could
be
useful
to
her
and
he
shook
hands
with
foker
most
cordially
and
gratefully
and
said
that
gentleman
had
done
him
the
very
greatest
service
all
right
said
foker
and
they
parted
with
mutual
esteem
on
his
return
to
fairoaks
the
next
day
major
pendennis
did
not
say
what
had
happened
to
him
on
the
previous
night
or
allude
to
the
company
in
which
he
had
passed
it
but
he
engaged
smirke
to
stop
to
dinner
and
any
person
accustomed
to
watch
his
manner
might
have
remarked
that
there
was
something
constrained
in
his
hilarity
and
talkativeness
and
that
he
was
unusually
gracious
and
watchful
in
his
communications
with
his
nephew
he
gave
pen
an
emphatic
when
the
lad
went
to
bed
and
as
they
were
about
to
part
for
the
night
he
seemed
as
if
he
was
going
to
say
something
to
pendennis
but
he
bethought
him
that
if
he
spoke
he
might
spoil
her
night
rest
and
allowed
her
to
sleep
in
peace
the
next
morning
he
was
down
in
the
earlier
than
was
his
custom
and
saluted
everybody
there
with
great
cordiality
the
post
used
to
arrive
commonly
about
the
end
of
this
meal
when
john
the
old
servant
entered
and
discharged
the
bag
of
its
letters
and
papers
the
major
looked
hard
at
pen
as
the
lad
got
his
arthur
blushed
and
put
his
letter
down
he
knew
the
hand
it
was
that
of
old
costigan
and
he
did
not
care
to
read
it
in
public
major
pendennis
knew
the
letter
too
he
had
put
it
into
the
post
himself
in
chatteris
the
day
before
he
told
little
laura
to
go
away
which
the
child
did
having
a
thorough
dislike
to
him
and
as
the
door
closed
on
her
he
took
hand
and
giving
her
a
look
full
of
meaning
pointed
to
the
letter
under
the
newspaper
which
pen
was
pretending
to
read
will
you
come
into
the
he
said
i
want
to
speak
to
and
she
followed
him
wondering
into
the
hall
what
is
it
she
said
nervously
the
affair
is
at
an
end
major
pendennis
said
he
has
a
letter
there
giving
him
his
dismissal
i
dictated
it
myself
yesterday
there
are
a
few
lines
from
the
lady
too
bidding
him
farewell
it
is
all
helen
ran
back
to
the
her
brother
following
pen
had
jumped
at
his
letter
the
instant
they
were
gone
he
was
reading
it
with
a
stupefied
face
it
stated
what
the
major
had
said
that
costigan
was
most
gratified
for
the
kindness
with
which
arthur
had
treated
his
daughter
but
that
he
was
only
now
made
aware
of
peecupiary
circumstances
they
were
such
that
marriage
was
at
present
out
of
the
question
and
considering
the
great
disparity
in
the
age
of
the
two
a
future
union
was
impossible
under
these
circumstances
and
with
the
deepest
regret
and
esteem
for
him
costigan
bade
arthur
farewell
and
suggested
that
he
should
cease
visiting
for
some
time
at
least
at
his
house
a
few
lines
from
miss
costigan
were
enclosed
she
acquiesced
in
the
decision
of
her
papa
she
pointed
out
that
she
was
many
years
older
than
arthur
and
that
an
engagement
was
not
to
be
thought
of
she
would
always
be
grateful
for
his
kindness
to
her
and
hoped
to
keep
his
friendship
but
at
present
and
until
the
pain
of
the
separation
should
be
over
she
entreated
they
should
not
meet
pen
read
costigan
letter
and
its
enclosure
mechanically
hardly
knowing
what
was
before
his
eyes
he
looked
up
wildly
and
saw
his
mother
and
uncle
regarding
him
with
sad
faces
helen
indeed
was
full
of
tender
maternal
anxiety
what
what
is
this
pen
said
it
some
joke
this
is
not
her
writing
this
is
some
servant
writing
who
playing
these
tricks
upon
me
it
comes
under
her
father
envelope
the
major
said
those
letters
you
had
before
were
not
in
her
hand
that
is
how
do
you
know
said
pen
very
fiercely
i
saw
her
write
it
the
uncle
answered
as
the
boy
started
up
and
his
mother
coming
forward
took
his
hand
he
put
her
away
how
came
you
to
see
her
how
came
you
between
me
and
her
what
have
i
ever
done
to
you
that
you
should
oh
it
not
true
it
not
true
pen
broke
out
with
a
wild
execration
she
ca
have
done
it
of
her
own
accord
she
ca
mean
it
she
pledged
to
me
who
has
told
her
lies
to
break
her
from
me
lies
are
not
told
in
the
family
arthur
major
pendennis
replied
i
told
her
the
truth
which
was
that
you
had
no
money
to
maintain
her
for
her
foolish
father
had
represented
you
to
be
rich
and
when
she
knew
how
poor
you
were
she
withdrew
at
once
and
without
any
persuasion
of
mine
she
was
quite
right
she
is
ten
years
older
than
you
are
she
is
perfectly
unfitted
to
be
your
wife
and
knows
it
look
at
that
handwriting
and
ask
yourself
is
such
a
woman
fitted
to
be
the
companion
of
your
mother
i
will
know
from
herself
if
it
is
true
arthur
said
crumpling
up
the
paper
wo
you
take
my
word
of
honour
her
letters
were
written
by
a
confidant
of
hers
who
writes
better
than
she
can
look
here
one
from
the
lady
to
your
friend
foker
you
have
seen
her
with
miss
costigan
as
whose
amanuensis
she
acted
the
major
said
with
ever
so
little
of
a
sneer
and
laid
down
a
certain
billet
which
foker
had
given
to
him
it
not
that
said
pen
burning
with
shame
and
rage
i
suppose
what
you
say
is
true
sir
but
i
hear
it
from
arthur
appealed
his
mother
i
will
see
her
said
arthur
i
ask
her
to
marry
me
once
more
i
will
no
one
shall
prevent
what
a
woman
who
spells
affection
with
one
f
nonsense
sir
be
a
man
and
remember
that
your
mother
is
a
lady
she
was
never
made
to
associate
with
that
tipsy
old
swindler
or
his
daughter
be
a
man
and
forget
her
as
she
does
be
a
man
and
comfort
your
mother
my
arthur
helen
said
going
and
embracing
him
and
seeing
that
the
pair
were
greatly
moved
major
pendennis
went
out
of
the
room
and
shut
the
door
upon
them
wisely
judging
that
they
were
best
alone
he
had
won
a
complete
victory
he
actually
had
brought
away
letters
in
his
portmanteau
from
chatteris
having
complimented
costigan
when
he
returned
them
by
giving
him
the
little
promissory
note
which
had
disquieted
himself
and
garbetts
and
for
which
the
major
settled
with
tatham
pen
rushed
wildly
off
to
chatteris
that
day
but
in
vain
attempted
to
see
miss
fotheringay
for
whom
he
left
a
letter
enclosed
to
her
father
the
enclosure
was
returned
by
costigan
who
begged
that
all
correspondence
might
end
and
after
one
or
two
further
attempts
of
the
lad
the
indignant
general
desired
that
their
acquaintance
might
cease
he
cut
pen
in
the
street
as
arthur
and
foker
were
pacing
the
castle
walk
one
day
they
came
upon
emily
on
her
father
arm
she
passed
without
any
nod
of
recognition
foker
felt
poor
pen
trembling
on
his
arm
his
uncle
wanted
him
to
travel
to
quit
the
country
for
a
while
and
his
mother
urged
him
too
for
he
was
growing
very
ill
and
suffered
severely
but
he
refused
and
said
he
would
not
go
he
would
not
obey
in
this
instance
and
his
mother
was
too
fond
and
his
uncle
too
wise
to
force
him
whenever
miss
fotheringay
acted
he
rode
over
to
the
chatteris
theatre
and
saw
her
one
night
there
were
so
few
people
in
the
house
that
the
manager
returned
the
money
pen
came
home
and
went
to
bed
at
eight
and
had
a
fever
if
this
continues
his
mother
will
be
going
over
and
fetching
the
girl
the
major
thought
in
despair
as
for
pen
he
thought
he
should
die
we
are
not
going
to
describe
his
feelings
or
give
a
dreary
journal
of
his
despair
and
passion
have
not
other
gentlemen
been
baulked
in
love
besides
mr
pen
yes
indeed
but
few
die
of
the
malady
chapter
xiv
in
which
miss
fotheringay
makes
a
new
engagement
within
a
short
period
of
the
events
above
narrated
mr
manager
bingley
was
performing
his
famous
character
of
in
to
a
house
so
exceedingly
thin
that
it
would
appear
as
if
the
part
of
rolla
was
by
no
means
such
a
favourite
with
the
people
of
chatteris
as
it
was
with
the
accomplished
actor
himself
scarce
anybody
was
in
the
theatre
poor
pen
had
the
boxes
almost
all
to
himself
and
sate
there
lonely
with
bloodshot
eyes
leaning
over
the
ledge
and
gazing
haggardly
towards
the
scene
when
cora
came
in
when
she
was
not
on
the
stage
he
saw
nothing
spaniards
and
peruvians
processions
and
battles
priests
and
virgins
of
the
sun
went
in
and
out
and
had
their
talk
but
arthur
took
no
note
of
any
of
them
and
only
saw
cora
whom
his
soul
longed
after
he
said
afterwards
that
he
wondered
he
had
not
taken
a
pistol
to
shoot
her
so
mad
was
he
with
love
and
rage
and
despair
and
had
it
not
been
for
his
mother
at
home
to
whom
he
did
not
speak
about
his
luckless
condition
but
whose
silent
sympathy
and
watchfulness
greatly
comforted
the
simple
half
fellow
who
knows
but
he
might
have
done
something
desperate
and
have
ended
his
days
prematurely
in
front
of
chatteris
gaol
there
he
sate
then
miserable
and
gazing
at
her
and
she
took
no
more
notice
of
him
than
he
did
of
the
rest
of
the
house
the
fotheringay
was
uncommonly
handsome
in
a
white
raiment
and
leopard
skin
with
a
sun
upon
her
breast
and
fine
tawdry
bracelets
on
her
beautiful
glancing
arms
she
spouted
to
admiration
the
few
words
of
her
part
and
looked
it
still
better
the
eyes
which
had
overthrown
soul
rolled
and
gleamed
as
lustrous
as
ever
but
it
was
not
to
him
that
they
were
directed
that
night
he
did
not
know
to
whom
or
remark
a
couple
of
gentlemen
in
the
box
next
to
him
upon
whom
miss
fotheringay
glances
were
perpetually
shining
nor
had
pen
noticed
the
extraordinary
change
which
had
taken
place
on
the
stage
a
short
time
after
the
entry
of
these
two
gentlemen
into
the
theatre
there
were
so
few
people
in
the
house
that
the
first
act
of
the
play
languished
entirely
and
there
had
been
some
question
of
returning
the
money
as
upon
that
other
unfortunate
night
when
poor
pen
had
been
driven
away
the
actors
were
perfectly
careless
about
their
parts
and
yawned
through
the
dialogue
and
talked
loud
to
each
other
in
the
intervals
even
bingley
was
listless
and
in
elvira
spoke
under
her
breath
how
came
it
that
all
of
a
sudden
bingley
began
to
raise
her
voice
and
bellow
like
a
bull
of
bashan
whence
was
it
that
bingley
flinging
off
his
apathy
darted
about
the
stage
and
yelled
like
dean
why
did
garbetts
and
rowkins
and
miss
rouncy
try
each
of
them
the
force
of
their
charms
or
graces
and
act
and
swagger
and
scowl
and
spout
their
very
loudest
at
the
two
gentlemen
in
box
no
one
was
a
quiet
little
man
in
black
with
a
grey
head
and
a
jolly
shrewd
face
the
other
was
in
all
respects
a
splendid
and
remarkable
individual
he
was
a
tall
and
portly
gentleman
with
a
hooked
nose
and
a
profusion
of
curling
brown
hair
and
whiskers
his
coat
was
covered
with
the
richest
and
velvet
he
had
many
splendid
rings
jewelled
pins
and
when
he
took
out
his
yellow
with
his
hand
that
was
cased
in
white
kids
a
delightful
odour
of
musk
and
bergamot
was
shaken
through
the
house
he
was
evidently
a
personage
of
rank
and
it
was
at
him
that
the
little
chatteris
company
was
acting
he
was
in
a
word
no
other
than
dolphin
the
great
manager
from
london
accompanied
by
his
faithful
friend
and
secretary
william
minns
without
whom
he
never
travelled
he
had
not
been
ten
minutes
in
the
theatre
before
his
august
presence
there
was
perceived
by
bingley
and
the
rest
and
they
all
began
to
act
their
best
and
try
to
engage
his
attention
even
miss
fotheringay
dull
heart
which
was
disturbed
at
nothing
felt
perhaps
a
flutter
when
she
came
in
presence
of
the
famous
london
impresario
she
had
not
much
to
do
in
her
part
but
to
look
handsome
and
stand
in
picturesque
attitudes
encircling
her
child
and
she
did
this
work
to
admiration
in
vain
the
various
actors
tried
to
win
the
favour
of
the
great
stage
sultan
pizarro
never
got
a
hand
from
him
bingley
yelled
and
bingley
bellowed
and
the
manager
only
took
snuff
out
of
his
great
gold
box
it
was
only
in
the
last
scene
when
rolla
comes
in
staggering
with
the
infant
bingley
is
not
so
strong
as
he
was
and
his
fourth
son
master
talma
bingley
is
a
monstrous
large
child
for
his
age
when
rolla
comes
staggering
with
the
child
to
cora
who
rushes
forward
with
a
shriek
and
says
o
god
there
blood
upon
him
that
the
london
manager
clapped
his
hands
and
broke
out
with
an
enthusiastic
bravo
then
having
concluded
his
applause
dolphin
gave
his
secretary
a
slap
on
the
shoulder
and
said
by
jove
billy
she
do
who
taught
her
that
dodge
said
old
billy
who
was
a
sardonic
old
gentleman
i
remember
her
at
the
olympic
and
hang
me
if
she
could
say
bo
to
a
it
was
little
bows
in
the
orchestra
who
had
taught
her
the
in
question
all
the
company
heard
the
applause
and
as
the
curtain
went
down
came
round
her
and
congratulated
and
hated
miss
fotheringay
now
dolphin
appearance
in
the
remote
little
chatteris
theatre
may
be
accounted
for
in
this
manner
in
spite
of
all
his
exertions
and
the
perpetual
blazes
of
triumph
coruscations
of
talent
victories
of
good
old
english
comedy
which
his
advertised
his
theatre
which
if
you
please
and
to
injure
no
present
susceptibilities
and
vested
interests
we
shall
call
the
museum
theatre
by
no
means

himself
on
the
verge

acted

twenty
nights
and
failed
to
remunerate
anybody

himself

in
their
favourite
round
of

the

chamberlain

put
a
stop
to

of
performance

lyrical
drama
though
brought
out
with
unexampled
splendour
and
success
with
monsieur

as
first
tenor
and
an
enormous
orchestra
had
almost
crushed
poor
dolphin
in
its
triumphant
progress
so
that
great
as
his
genius
and
resources
were
they
seemed
to
be
at
an
end
he
was
dragging
on
his
season
wretchedly
with
half
salaries
small
operas
feeble
old
comedies
and
his
ballet
company
and
everybody
was
looking
out
for
the
day
when
he
should
appear
in
the
gazette
one
of
the
illustrious
patrons
of
the
museum
theatre
and
occupant
of
the
great
was
a
gentleman
whose
name
has
been
mentioned
in
a
previous
history
that
refined
patron
of
the
arts
and
enlightened
lover
of
music
and
the
drama
the
most
noble
the
marquis
of
steyne
his
lordship
avocations
as
a
statesman
prevented
him
from
attending
the
playhouse
very
often
or
coming
very
early
but
he
occasionally
appeared
at
the
theatre
in
time
for
the
ballet
and
was
always
received
with
the
greatest
respect
by
the
manager
from
whom
he
sometimes
condescended
to
receive
a
visit
in
his
box
it
communicated
with
the
stage
and
when
anything
occurred
there
which
particularly
pleased
him
when
a
new
face
made
its
appearance
among
the
coryphees
or
a
fair
dancer
executed
a
pas
with
especial
grace
or
agility
wenham
wagg
or
some
other
of
the
noble
marquis
would
be
commissioned
to
go
behind
the
scenes
and
express
the
great
man
approbation
or
make
the
inquiries
which
were
prompted
by
his
lordship
curiosity
or
his
interest
in
the
dramatic
art
he
could
not
be
seen
by
the
audience
for
lord
steyne
sate
modestly
behind
a
curtain
and
looked
only
towards
the
stage
but
you
could
know
he
was
in
the
house
by
the
glances
which
all
the
and
all
the
principal
dancers
cast
towards
his
box
i
have
seen
many
scores
of
pairs
of
eyes
as
in
the
palm
dance
in
the
ballet
of
cook
at
otaheite
where
no
less
than
a
lovely
female
savages
in
palm
leaves
and
feather
aprons
were
made
to
dance
round
floridor
as
captain
cook
ogling
that
box
as
they
performed
before
it
and
have
often
wondered
to
remark
the
presence
of
mind
of
mademoiselle
sauterelle
or
mademoiselle
de
bondi
known
as
la
petite
caoutchoue
who
when
actually
up
in
the
air
quivering
like
so
many
shuttlecocks
always
kept
their
lovely
eyes
winking
at
that
box
in
which
the
great
steyne
sate
now
and
then
you
would
hear
a
harsh
voice
from
behind
the
curtain
cry
brava
brava
or
a
pair
of
white
gloves
wave
from
it
and
begin
to
applaud
bondi
or
sauterelle
when
they
came
down
to
earth
curtsied
and
smiled
especially
to
those
hands
before
they
walked
up
the
stage
again
panting
and
happy
one
night
this
great
prince
surrounded
by
a
few
choice
friends
was
in
his
box
at
the
museum
and
they
were
making
such
a
noise
and
laughter
that
the
pit
was
scandalised
and
many
indignant
voices
were
bawling
out
silence
so
loudly
that
wagg
wondered
the
police
did
not
interfere
to
take
the
rascals
out
wenham
was
amusing
the
party
in
the
box
with
extracts
from
a
private
letter
which
he
had
received
from
major
pendennis
whose
absence
in
the
country
at
the
full
london
season
had
been
remarked
and
of
course
deplored
by
his
friends
the
secret
is
out
said
wenham
there
a
woman
in
the
why
d
it
wenham

your
age
said
the
gentleman
behind
the
curtain

said
wenham
with
a
gallant
air
for
my
part
i
hope
to
be
a
victim
till
i
die
and
to
break
my
heart
every
year
of
my
the

of
which
sentence

my
lord

need
not
talk
i
three
years
younger
than
you
and
twice
as
well
wenham

said
the
great
man
with
one
of
his
usual
oaths
by

i
like
to
see
a
fellow
preserving
all
the
illusions
of
youth
up
to
our
time
of
life
and
keeping
his
heart
warm
as
yours
is
hang
it
sir
it
a
comfort
to
meet
with
such
a
generous
candid
who
that
gal
in
the
second
row
with
blue
ribbons
third
from
the
stage
fine
gal
yes
you

i
are
sentimentalists
wagg
i
do
think
so
much
cares

the
stomach
rather
more
than
the
heart
with
you
eh
wagg
my
boy
i
like
everything
that
good
said
wagg
generously
beauty
and
burgundy
venus
and
venison
i
do
say
that
venus
turtles
are
to
be
despised
because
they
do
cook
them
at
the
london
tavern
but
but
tell
us
about
old
pendennis
wenham
he
abruptly
concluded
for
his
joke
flagged
just
then
as
he
saw
that
his
patron
was
not
listening
in
fact
steyne
glasses
were
up
and
he
was
examining
some
object
on
the
stage
yes
i
heard
that
joke
about
venus
turtle
and
the
london
tavern
before
you
begin
to
fail
my
poor
wagg
if
you
do
mind
i
shall
be
obliged
to
have
a
new
jester
lord
steyne
said
laying
down
his
glass
go
on
wenham
about
old
dear
wenham
he
begins
wenham
read
as
you
have
had
my
character
in
your
hands
for
the
last
three
weeks
and
no
doubt
have
torn
me
to
shreds
according
to
your
custom
i
think
you
can
afford
to
be
by
way
of
variety
and
to
do
me
a
service
it
is
a
delicate
matter
entre
nous
une
affaire
de
coeur
there
is
a
young
friend
of
mine
who
is
gone
wild
about
a
certain
miss
fotheringay
an
actress
at
the
theatre
here
and
i
must
own
to
you
as
handsome
a
woman
and
as
it
appears
to
me
as
good
an
actress
as
ever
put
on
rouge
she
does
ophelia
lady
teazle
haller
that
sort
of
thing
upon
my
word
she
is
as
splendid
as
georges
in
her
best
days
and
as
far
as
i
know
utterly
superior
to
anything
we
have
on
our
scene
i
want
a
london
engagement
for
her
ca
you
get
your
friend
dolphin
to
come
and
see
her
to
engage
her
to
take
her
out
of
this
place
a
word
from
a
noble
friend
of
ours
you
understand
would
be
invaluable
and
if
you
could
get
the
gaunt
house
interest
for
me
i
will
promise
anything
i
can
in
return
for
your
service
which
i
shall
consider
one
of
the
greatest
that
can
be
done
to
me
do
do
this
now
as
a
good
fellow
which
i
always
said
you
were
and
in
return
command
yours
truly
it
a
clear
case
said
wenham
having
read
this
letter
old
pendennis
is
in
and
wants
to
get
the
woman
up
to
london
evidently
continued
wagg
i
should
like
to
see
pendennis
on
his
knees
with
the
rheumatism
said
wenham
or
accommodating
the
beloved
object
with
a
lock
of
his
hair
said
wagg
said
the
great
man
he
has
relations
in
the
country
he
he
said
something
about
a
nephew
whose
interest
could
return
a
member
it
is
the
nephew
affair
depend
on
it
the
young
one
is
in
a
scrape
i
was
myself
when
i
was
in
the
fifth
form
at
eton
a
daughter
and
swore
i
marry
her
i
was
mad
about
her
poor
polly
here
he
made
a
pause
and
perhaps
the
past
rose
up
to
lord
steyne
and
george
gaunt
was
a
boy
again
not
altogether
but
i
say
she
must
be
a
fine
woman
from
pendennis
account
have
in
dolphin
and
let
us
hear
if
he
knows
anything
of
at
this
wenham
sprang
out
of
the
box
passed
the
servitor
who
waited
at
the
door
communicating
with
the
stage
and
who
saluted
wenham
with
profound
respect
and
the
latter
emissary
pushing
on
and
familiar
with
the
place
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
out
the
manager
who
was
employed
as
he
not
unfrequently
was
in
swearing
and
cursing
the
ladies
of
the
for
not
doing
their
duty
the
oaths
died
away
on
dolphin
lips
as
soon
as
he
saw
wenham
and
he
drew
off
the
hand
which
was
clenched
in
the
face
of
one
of
the
offending
coryphees
to
grasp
that
of
the
how
do
wenham
how
his
lordship
looks
uncommonly
well
said
the
manager
smiling
as
if
he
had
never
been
out
of
temper
in
his
life
and
he
was
only
too
delighted
to
follow
lord
steyne
ambassador
and
pay
his
personal
respects
to
that
great
man
the
visit
to
chatteris
was
the
result
of
their
conversation
and
dolphin
wrote
to
his
lordship
from
that
place
and
did
himself
the
honour
to
inform
the
marquess
of
steyne
that
he
had
seen
the
lady
about
whom
his
lordship
had
spoken
that
he
was
as
much
struck
by
her
talents
as
he
was
by
her
personal
appearance
and
that
he
had
made
an
engagement
with
miss
fotheringay
who
would
soon
have
the
honour
of
appearing
before
a
london
audience
and
his
noble
and
enlightened
patron
the
marquess
of
steyne
pen
read
the
announcement
of
miss
fotheringay
engagement
in
the
chatteris
paper
where
he
had
so
often
praised
her
charms
the
editor
made
very
handsome
mention
of
her
talent
and
beauty
and
prophesied
her
success
in
the
metropolis
bingley
the
manager
began
to
advertise
the
last
night
of
miss
fotheringay
poor
pen
and
sir
derby
oaks
were
very
constant
at
the
play
sir
derby
in
the
throwing
bouquets
and
getting
pen
in
the
almost
deserted
boxes
haggard
wretched
and
lonely
nobody
cared
whether
miss
fotheringay
was
going
or
staying
except
those
two
and
perhaps
one
more
which
was
bows
of
the
orchestra
he
came
out
of
his
place
one
night
and
went
into
the
house
to
the
box
where
pen
was
and
he
held
out
his
hand
to
him
and
asked
him
to
come
and
walk
they
walked
down
the
street
together
and
went
and
sate
upon
chatteris
bridge
in
the
moonlight
and
talked
about
her
we
may
sit
on
the
same
bridge
said
he
we
have
been
in
the
same
boat
for
a
long
time
you
are
not
the
only
man
who
has
made
a
fool
of
himself
about
that
woman
and
i
have
less
excuse
than
you
because
i
am
older
and
know
her
better
she
has
no
more
heart
than
the
stone
you
are
leaning
on
and
it
or
you
or
i
might
fall
into
the
water
and
never
come
up
again
and
she
would
care
yes
she
would
care
for
me
because
she
wants
me
to
teach
her
and
she
wo
be
able
to
get
on
without
me
and
will
be
forced
to
send
for
me
from
london
but
she
would
if
she
did
want
me
she
has
no
heart
and
no
head
and
no
sense
and
no
feelings
and
no
griefs
or
cares
whatever
i
was
going
to
say
no
pleasures
but
the
fact
is
she
does
like
her
dinner
and
she
is
pleased
when
people
admire
and
you
do
said
pen
interested
out
of
himself
and
wondering
at
the
crabbed
homely
little
old
man
it
a
habit
like
taking
snuff
or
drinking
drams
said
the
other
i
been
taking
her
these
five
years
and
ca
do
without
her
it
was
i
made
her
if
she
does
send
for
me
i
shall
follow
her
but
i
know
she
send
for
me
she
wants
me
some
day
she
marry
and
fling
me
over
as
i
do
the
end
of
this
the
little
flaming
spark
dropped
into
the
water
below
and
disappeared
and
pen
as
he
rode
home
that
night
actually
thought
about
somebody
but
himself
chapter

the
happy
village
until
the
enemy
had
retired
altogether
from
before
the
place
major
pendennis
was
resolved
to
keep
his
garrison
in
fairoaks
he
did
not
appear
to
watch
pen
behaviour
or
to
put
any
restraint
on
his
actions
but
he
managed
nevertheless
to
keep
the
lad
constantly
under
his
eye
or
those
of
his
agents
and
young
arthur
comings
and
goings
were
quite
well
known
to
his
vigilant
guardian
i
suppose
there
is
scarcely
any
man
who
reads
this
or
any
other
novel
but
has
been
baulked
in
love
some
time
or
the
other
by
fate
and
circumstance
by
falsehood
of
women
or
his
own
fault
let
that
worthy
friend
recall
his
own
sensations
under
the
circumstances
and
apply
them
as
illustrative
of
mr
pen
anguish
ah
what
weary
nights
and
sickening
fevers
ah
what
mad
desires
dashing
up
against
some
rock
of
obstruction
or
indifference
and
flung
back
again
from
the
unimpressionable
granite
if
a
list
could
be
made
this
very
night
in
london
of
the
groans
thoughts
imprecations
of
tossing
lovers
what
a
catalogue
it
would
be
i
wonder
what
a
percentage
of
the
male
population
of
the
metropolis
will
be
lying
awake
at
two
or
three
morning
counting
the
hours
as
they
go
by
knelling
drearily
and
rolling
from
left
to
right
restless
yearning
and
what
a
pang
it
is
i
never
knew
a
man
die
of
love
certainly
but
i
have
known
a
man
go
down
to
five
under
a
disappointed
passion
so
that
pretty
nearly
quarter
of
him
may
be
said
to
have
perished
and
that
is
no
small
portion
he
has
come
back
to
his
old
size
subsequently
perhaps
is
bigger
than
ever
very
likely
some
new
affection
has
closed
round
his
heart
and
ribs
and
made
them
comfortable
and
young
pen
is
a
man
who
will
console
himself
like
the
rest
of
us
we
say
this
lest
the
ladies
should
be
disposed
to
deplore
him
prematurely
or
be
seriously
uneasy
with
regard
to
his
complaint
his
mother
was
but
what
will
not
a
maternal
fondness
fear
or
invent
depend
on
it
my
dear
creature
major
pendennis
would
say
gallantly
to
her
the
boy
will
recover
as
soon
as
we
get
her
out
of
the
country
we
will
take
him
somewhere
and
show
him
a
little
life
meantime
make
yourself
easy
about
him
half
a
fellow
pangs
at
losing
a
woman
result
from
vanity
more
than
affection
to
be
left
by
a
woman
is
the
deuce
and
all
to
be
sure
but
look
how
easily
we
leave
pendennis
did
not
know
this
sort
of
knowledge
had
by
no
means
come
within
the
simple
lady
scope
indeed
she
did
not
like
the
subject
or
to
talk
of
it
her
heart
had
had
its
own
little
private
misadventure
and
she
had
borne
up
against
it
and
cured
it
and
perhaps
she
had
not
much
patience
with
other
folk
passions
except
of
course
arthur
whose
sufferings
she
made
her
own
feeling
indeed
very
likely
in
many
of
the
boy
illnesses
and
pains
a
great
deal
more
than
pen
himself
endured
and
she
watched
him
through
this
present
grief
with
a
jealous
silent
sympathy
although
as
we
have
said
he
did
not
talk
to
her
of
his
unfortunate
condition
the
major
must
be
allowed
to
have
had
not
a
little
merit
and
forbearance
and
to
have
exhibited
a
highly
creditable
degree
of
family
affection
the
life
at
fairoaks
was
uncommonly
dull
to
a
man
who
had
the
entree
of
half
the
houses
in
london
and
was
in
the
habit
of
making
his
bow
in
three
or
four
of
a
night
a
dinner
with
doctor
portman
or
a
neighbouring
squire
now
and
then
a
dreary
rubber
at
backgammon
with
the
widow
who
did
her
utmost
to
amuse
him
these
were
the
chief
of
his
pleasures
he
used
to
long
for
the
arrival
of
the
bag
with
the
letters
and
he
read
every
word
of
the
evening
paper
he
doctored
himself
too
assiduously
a
course
of
quiet
living
would
suit
him
well
he
thought
after
the
london
banquets
he
dressed
himself
laboriously
every
morning
and
afternoon
he
took
regular
exercise
up
and
down
the
terrace
walk
thus
with
his
cane
his
toilet
his
his
and
his
newspaper
this
worthy
and
worldly
philosopher
fenced
himself
against
ennui
and
if
he
did
not
improve
each
shining
hour
like
the
bees

made
one
hour
after
another
pass
as
he
could
and
rendered
his
captivity
just
tolerable
after
this
period
it
was
remarked
that
he
was
fond
of
bringing
round
the
conversation
to
the
american
war
the
massacre
of
wyoming
and
the
brilliant
actions
of
saint
lucie
the
fact
being
that
he
had
a
couple
of
volumes
of
the
register
in
his
bedroom
which
he
sedulously
studied
it
is
thus
a
man
will
accommodate
himself
to
circumstances
and
show
himself
calmly
superior
to
fortune
pen
sometimes
took
the
box
at
backgammon
of
a
night
or
would
listen
to
his
mother
simple
music
of
summer
evenings
but
he
was
very
restless
and
wretched
in
spite
of
all
and
has
been
known
to
be
up
before
the
early
daylight
even
and
down
at
a
in
clavering
park
a
dreary
pool
with
innumerable
whispering
rushes
and
green
alders
where
a
milkmaid
drowned
herself
in
the
baronet
grandfather
time
and
her
ghost
was
said
to
walk
still
but
pen
did
not
drown
himself
as
perhaps
his
mother
fancied
might
be
his
intention
he
liked
to
go
and
fish
there
and
think
and
think
at
leisure
as
the
float
quivered
in
the
little
eddies
of
the
pond
and
the
fish
flapped
about
him
if
he
got
a
bite
he
was
excited
enough
and
in
this
way
occasionally
brought
home
carps
tenches
and
eels
which
the
major
cooked
in
the
continental
fashion
by
this
pond
and
under
a
tree
which
was
his
favourite
resort
pen
composed
a
number
of
poems
suitable
to
his
circumstances
over
which
verses
he
blushed
in
after
days
wondering
how
he
could
ever
have
invented
such
rubbish
and
as
for
the
tree
why
it
is
in
a
hollow
of
this
very
tree
where
he
used
to
put
his
of
and
other
fishing
commodities
that
he
afterwards
but
we
are
advancing
matters
suffice
it
to
say
he
wrote
poems
and
relieved
himself
very
much
when
a
man
grief
or
passion
is
at
this
point
it
may
be
loud
but
it
is
not
very
severe
when
a
gentleman
is
cudgelling
his
brain
to
find
any
rhyme
for
sorrow
besides
borrow
and
his
woes
are
nearer
at
an
end
than
he
thinks
for
so
were
pen
he
had
his
hot
and
cold
fits
his
days
of
sullenness
and
peevishness
and
of
blank
resignation
and
despondency
and
occasional
mad
paroxysms
of
rage
and
longing
in
which
fits
rebecca
would
be
saddled
and
galloped
fiercely
about
the
country
or
into
chatteris
her
rider
gesticulating
wildly
on
her
back
and
astonishing
carters
and
turnpikemen
as
he
passed
crying
out
the
name
of
the
false
one
foker
became
a
very
frequent
and
welcome
visitor
at
fairoaks
during
this
period
where
his
good
spirits
and
oddities
always
amused
the
major
and
pendennis
while
they
astonished
the
widow
and
little
laura
not
a
little
his
tandem
made
a
great
sensation
in
clavering
where
he
upset
a
market
stall
and
cut
pybus
poodle
over
the
shaven
quarters
and
drank
a
glass
of
raspberry
bitters
at
the
clavering
arms
all
the
society
in
the
little
place
heard
who
he
was
and
looked
out
his
name
in
their
peerages
he
was
so
young
and
their
books
so
old
that
his
name
did
not
appear
in
many
of
their
volumes
and
his
mamma
now
quite
an
antiquated
lady
figured
amongst
the
progeny
of
the
earl
of
rosherville
as
lady
agnes
milton
still
but
his
name
wealth
and
honourable
lineage
were
speedily
known
about
clavering
where
you
may
be
sure
that
poor
pen
little
transaction
with
the
chatteris
actress
was
also
pretty
freely
discussed
looking
at
the
little
old
town
of
clavering
mary
from
the
london
road
as
it
runs
by
the
lodge
at
fairoaks
and
seeing
the
rapid
and
shining
brawl
winding
down
from
the
town
and
skirting
the
woods
of
clavering
park
and
the
ancient
church
tower
and
peaked
roofs
of
the
houses
rising
up
amongst
trees
and
old
walls
behind
which
swells
a
fair
background
of
sunshiny
hills
that
stretch
from
clavering
westwards
towards
the
sea
the
place
looks
so
cheery
and
comfortable
that
many
a
traveller
heart
must
have
yearned
towards
it
from
the
and
he
must
have
thought
that
it
was
in
such
a
calm
friendly
nook
he
would
like
to
shelter
at
the
end
of
life
struggle
tom
smith
who
used
to
drive
the
alacrity
coach
would
often
point
to
a
tree
near
the
river
from
which
a
fine
view
of
the
church
and
town
was
commanded
and
inform
his
companion
on
the
box
that
artises
come
and
take
hoff
the
church
from
that
there
tree
it
was
a
habby
once
sir
and
indeed
a
pretty
view
it
is
which
i
recommend
to
stanfield
or
roberts
for
their
next
tour
like
constantinople
seen
from
the
bosphorus
like
rougemont
viewed
in
her
box
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
house
like
many
an
object
which
we
pursue
in
life
and
admire
before
we
have
attained
it
clavering
is
rather
prettier
at
a
distance
than
it
is
on
a
closer
acquaintance
the
town
so
cheerful
of
aspect
a
few
furlongs
off
looks
very
blank
and
dreary
except
on
market
days
there
is
nobody
in
the
streets
the
clack
of
a
pair
of
pattens
echoes
through
half
the
place
and
you
may
hear
the
creaking
of
the
rusty
old
ensign
at
the
clavering
arms
without
being
disturbed
by
any
other
noise
there
has
not
been
a
ball
in
the
assembly
rooms
since
the
clavering
volunteers
gave
one
to
their
colonel
the
old
sir
francis
clavering
and
the
stables
which
once
held
a
great
part
of
that
brilliant
but
defunct
regiment
are
now
cheerless
and
empty
except
on
thursdays
when
the
farmers
put
up
there
and
their
tilted
carts
and
gigs
make
a
feeble
show
of
liveliness
in
the
place
or
on
petty
sessions
when
the
magistrates
attend
in

used
to
be

up

its
great
grey
towers

illuminates

delicate
carving

shadows
of

huge
buttresses
and
gilding
the
glittering
windows
and
flaming
vanes
the
image
of
the

wrenched
out
of

ago

of

who
were
out

seem
to
have
a
severe

and
so
forth
how
well
in
after

pen
remembered
those
effigies
and
how
often
in
youth
he
scanned
them
as
the

was
grumbling
the
sermon
from
the
pulpit
and
smirke
mild
head
and
forehead
curl
peered
over

in

the
fairoaks
folks
were
constant
at

had
a

so
had

and
those

three

and
a
very
young
man
in
a

the

were
numerous
and
faithful

and
his

regularly
came
to

so
did
one

apothecaries
pybus
went
turn
and
turn
about
to
the
low
town
church
and
to
the
abbey
the
charity
school
and
their
families
of
course
came
boys
made
a
good
cheerful
noise
scuffling
with
their
feet
as
they
marched
into
church
and
up
the
stair
and
blowing
their
noses
a
good
deal
during
the
service
to
be
brief
the
congregation
looked
as
decent
as
might
be
in
these
bad
times
the
abbey
church
was
furnished
with
a
magnificent
screen
and
many
hatchments
and
heraldic
tombstones
the
doctor
spent
a
great
part
of
his
income
in
beautifying
his
darling
place
he
had
endowed
it
with
a
superb
painted
window
bought
in
the
netherlands
and
an
organ
grand
enough
for
a
cathedral
but
in
spite
of
organ
and
window
in
consequence
of
the
latter
very
likely
which
had
come
out
of
a
papistical
place
of
worship
and
was
blazoned
all
over
with
idolatry
clavering
new
church
prospered
scandalously
in
the
teeth
of
orthodoxy
and
many
of
the
congregation
deserted
to
simcoe
and
the
honourable
woman
his
wife
their
efforts
had
thinned
the
very
ebenezer
hard
by
them
which
building
before
simcoe
advent
used
to
be
so
full
that
you
could
see
the
backs
of
the
congregation
squeezing
out
of
the
arched
windows
thereof
simcoe
tracts
fluttered
into
the
doors
of
all
the
doctor
cottages
and
were
taken
as
greedily
as
honest
portman
soup
with
the
quality
of
which
the
graceless
people
found
fault
with
the
folks
at
the
ribbon
factory
situated
by
the
weir
on
the
brawl
side
and
round
which
the
low
town
had
grown
orthodoxy
could
make
no
way
at
all
quiet
miss
myra
was
put
out
of
court
by
impetuous
simcoe
and
her
female
ah
it
was
a
hard
burthen
for
the
doctor
lady
to
bear
to
behold
her
husband
congregation
dwindling
away
to
give
the
precedence
on
the
few
occasions
when
they
met
to
a
notorious
wife
who
was
the
daughter
of
an
irish
peer
to
know
that
there
was
a
party
in
clavering
their
own
town
of
clavering
on
which
her
doctor
spent
a
great
deal
more
than
his
professional
income
who
held
him
up
to
odium
because
he
played
a
rubber
at
whist
and
pronounced
him
to
be
a
heathen
because
he
went
to
the
play
in
her
grief
she
besought
him
to
give
up
the
play
and
the
rubber
indeed
they
could
scarcely
get
a
table
now
so
dreadful
was
the
outcry
against
the
sport
but
the
doctor
declared
that
he
would
do
what
he
thought
right
and
what
the
great
and
good
george
the
third
did
whose
chaplain
he
had
been
and
as
for
giving
up
whist
because
those
silly
folks
cried
out
against
it
he
would
play
dummy
to
the
end
of
his
days
with
his
wife
and
myra
rather
than
yield
to
their
despicable
persecutions
of
the
two
families
owners
of
the
factory
which
had
spoiled
the
brawl
as
a
and
brought
all
the
mischief
into
the
town
the
senior
partner
rolt
went
to
ebenezer
the
junior
barker
to
the
new
church
in
a
word
people
quarrelled
in
this
little
place
a
great
deal
more
than
neighbours
do
in
london
and
in
the
book
club
which
the
prudent
and
conciliating
pendennis
had
set
up
and
which
ought
to
have
been
a
neutral
territory
they
bickered
so
much
that
nobody
scarcely
was
ever
seen
in
the
except
smirke
who
though
he
kept
up
a
faint
amity
with
the
simcoe
faction
had
still
a
taste
for
magazines
and
light
worldly
literature
and
old
glanders
whose
white
head
and
grizzly
moustache
might
be
seen
at
the
window
and
of
course
little
pybus
who
looked
at
everybody
letters
as
the
post
brought
them
for
the
clavering
as
every
one
knows
used
to
be
held
at
baker
library
london
street
formerly
hog
lane
and
read
every
advertisement
in
the
paper
it
may
be
imagined
how
great
a
sensation
was
created
in
this
amiable
little
community
when
the
news
reached
it
of
mr
pen
at
chatteris
it
was
carried
from
house
to
house
and
formed
the
subject
of
talk
at
and
tables
it
was
canvassed
by
the
misses
finucane
and
their
teachers
and
very
likely
debated
by
the
young
ladies
in
the
dormitories
for
what
we
know
wapshot
big
boys
had
their
version
of
the
story
and
eyed
pen
curiously
as
he
sate
in
his
pew
at
church
or
raised
the
finger
of
scorn
at
him
as
he
passed
through
chatteris
they
always
hated
him
and
called
him
lord
pendennis
because
he
did
not
wear
corduroys
as
they
did
and
rode
a
horse
and
gave
himself
the
airs
of
a
buck
and
if
the
truth
must
be
told
it
was
portman
herself
who
was
the
chief
narrator
of
the
story
of
pen
loves
whatever
tales
this
candid
woman
heard
she
was
sure
to
impart
them
to
her
neighbours
and
after
she
had
been
put
into
possession
of
pen
secret
by
the
little
scandal
at
chatteris
poor
doctor
portman
knew
that
it
would
next
day
be
about
the
parish
of
which
he
was
the
rector
and
so
indeed
it
was
the
whole
society
there
had
the
legend
at
the
at
the
milliner
at
the
and
the
general
warehouse
at
the
corner
of
the
market
at
pybus
at
the
glanders
at
the
honourable
simcoe
soiree
at
the
factory
nay
through
the
mill
itself
the
tale
was
current
in
a
few
hours
and
young
arthur
pendennis
madness
was
in
every
mouth
all
portman
acquaintances
barked
out
upon
him
when
he
walked
the
street
the
next
day
the
poor
divine
knew
that
his
betsy
was
the
author
of
the
rumour
and
groaned
in
spirit
well
well
it
must
have
come
in
a
day
or
two
and
it
was
as
well
that
the
town
should
have
the
real
story
what
the
clavering
folks
thought
of
pendennis
for
spoiling
her
son
and
of
that
precocious
young
rascal
of
an
arthur
for
daring
to
propose
to
a
need
not
be
told
here
if
pride
exists
amongst
any
folks
in
our
country
and
assuredly
we
have
enough
of
it
there
is
no
pride
more
than
that
of
twopenny
old
gentlewomen
in
small
towns
gracious
goodness
the
cry
was
how
infatuated
the
mother
is
about
that
pert
and
headstrong
boy
who
gives
himself
the
airs
of
a
lord
on
his
and
for
whom
our
society
is
not
good
enough
and
who
would
marry
an
odious
painted
actress
off
a
booth
where
very
likely
he
wants
to
rant
himself
if
dear
good
pendennis
had
been
alive
this
scandal
would
never
have
no
more
it
would
very
likely
nor
should
we
have
been
occupied
in
narrating
pen
history
it
was
true
that
he
gave
himself
airs
to
the
clavering
folks
naturally
haughty
and
frank
their
cackle
and
small
talk
and
small
dignities
bored
him
and
he
showed
a
contempt
which
he
could
not
conceal
the
doctor
and
the
curate
were
the
only
people
pen
cared
for
in
the
place
even
portman
shared
in
the
general
distrust
of
him
and
of
his
mother
the
widow
who
kept
herself
aloof
from
the
village
society
and
was
sneered
at
accordingly
because
she
tried
forsooth
to
keep
her
head
up
with
the
great
county
families
she
indeed
barker
at
the
factory
has
four
times
the
butcher
meat
that
goes
up
to
fairoaks
with
all
their
fine
airs
etc
etc
etc
let
the
reader
fill
up
these
details
according
to
his
liking
and
experience
of
village
scandal
they
will
suffice
to
show
how
it
was
that
a
good
woman
occupied
solely
in
doing
her
duty
to
her

and
her
children
and
an
honest
brave
lad
impetuous
and
full
of
good
and
wishing
well
to
every
mortal
alive
found
enemies
and
detractors
amongst
people
to
whom
they
were
superior
and
to
whom
they
had
never
done
anything
like
harm
the
clavering
curs
were
yelping
all
round
the
house
of
fairoaks
and
delighted
to
pull
pen
down
doctor
portman
and
smirke
were
both
cautious
of
informing
the
widow
of
the
constant
outbreak
of
calumny
which
was
pursuing
poor
pen
though
glanders
who
was
a
friend
of
the
house
kept
him
au
courant
it
may
be
imagined
what
his
indignation
was
was
there
any
man
in
the
village
whom
he
could
call
to
account
presently
some
wags
began
to
chalk
up
for
ever
and
other
sarcastic
allusions
to
late
transactions
at
fairoaks
gate
another
brought
a
large
playbill
from
chatteris
and
wafered
it
there
one
night
on
one
occasion
pen
riding
through
the
lower
town
fancied
he
heard
the
factory
boys
jeer
him
and
finally
going
through
the
doctor
gate
into
the
churchyard
where
some
of
wapshot
boys
were
lounging
the
biggest
of
them
a
young
gentleman
about
twenty
years
of
age
son
of
a
neighbouring
small
squire
who
lived
in
the
doubtful
capacity
of
with
wapshot
flung
himself
into
a
theatrical
attitude
near
a
grave
and
began
repeating
hamlet
verses
over
ophelia
with
a
hideous
leer
at
pen
the
young
fellow
was
so
enraged
that
he
rushed
at
hobnell
major
with
a
shriek
very
much
resembling
an
oath
cut
him
furiously
across
the
face
with
the
which
he
carried
flung
it
away
calling
upon
the
cowardly
villain
to
defend
himself
and
in
another
minute
knocked
the
bewildered
young
ruffian
into
the
grave
which
was
just
waiting
for
a
different
lodger
then
with
his
fists
clenched
and
his
face
quivering
with
passion
and
indignation
he
roared
out
to
hobnell
gaping
companions
to
know
if
any
of
the
blackguards
would
come
on
but
they
held
back
with
a
growl
and
retreated
as
doctor
portman
came
up
to
his
wicket
and
hobnell
with
his
nose
and
lip
bleeding
piteously
emerged
from
the
grave
pen
looking
death
and
defiance
at
the
lads
who
retreated
toward
their
side
of
the
churchyard
walked
back
again
through
the
wicket
and
was
interrogated
by
that
gentleman
the
young
fellow
was
so
agitated
he
could
scarcely
speak
his
voice
broke
into
a
sob
as
he
answered
the
coward
insulted
me
sir
he
said
and
the
doctor
passed
over
the
oath
and
respected
the
emotion
of
the
honest
suffering
young
heart
pendennis
the
elder
who
like
a
real
man
of
the
world
had
a
proper
and
constant
dread
of
the
opinion
of
his
neighbour
was
prodigiously
annoyed
by
the
absurd
little
tempest
which
was
blowing
in
chatteris
and
tossing
about
master
pen
reputation
doctor
portman
and
captain
glanders
had
to
support
the
charges
of
the
whole
chatteris
society
against
the
young
reprobate
who
was
looked
upon
as
a
monster
of
crime
pen
did
not
say
anything
about
the
churchyard
scuffle
at
home
but
went
over
to
baymouth
and
took
counsel
with
his
friend
harry
foker
who
drove
over
his
drag
presently
to
the
clavering
arms
whence
he
sent
stoopid
with
a
note
to
thomas
hobnell
at
the
rev
wapshot
and
a
civil
message
to
ask
when
he
should
wait
upon
that
gentleman
stoopid
brought
back
word
that
the
note
had
been
opened
by
hobnell
and
read
to
half
a
dozen
of
the
big
boys
on
whom
it
seemed
to
make
a
great
impression
and
that
after
consulting
together
and
laughing
hobnell
said
he
would
send
an
answer
arter
arternoon
school
which
the
bell
was
and
wapshot
he
came
out
in
his
master
stoopid
was
learned
in
academical
costume
having
attended
foker
at
boniface
foker
went
out
to
see
the
curiosities
of
clavering
meanwhile
but
not
having
a
taste
for
architecture
doctor
portman
fine
church
did
not
engage
his
attention
much
and
he
pronounced
the
tower
to
be
as
mouldy
as
an
old
stilton
cheese
he
walked
down
the
street
and
looked
at
the
few
shops
there
he
saw
captain
glanders
at
the
window
of
the
and
having
taken
a
good
stare
at
that
gentleman
he
wagged
his
head
at
him
in
token
of
satisfaction
he
inquired
the
price
of
meat
at
the
butcher
with
an
air
of
the
greatest
interest
and
asked
when
was
next
killing
day
he
flattened
his
little
nose
against
madame
fribsby
window
to
see
if
haply
there
was
a
pretty
workwoman
in
her
premises
but
there
was
no
face
more
comely
than
the
doll
or
wearing
the
french
cap
in
the
window
only
that
of
madame
fribsby
herself
dimly
visible
in
the
parlour
reading
a
novel
that
object
was
not
of
sufficient
interest
to
keep
foker
very
long
in
contemplation
and
so
having
exhausted
the
town
and
the
inn
stables
in
which
there
were
no
cattle
save
the
single
old
pair
of
posters
that
earned
a
scanty
livelihood
by
transporting
the
gentry
round
about
to
the
county
dinners
foker
was
giving
himself
up
to
ennui
entirely
when
a
messenger
from
hobnell
was
at
length
announced
it
was
no
other
than
wapshot
himself
who
came
with
an
air
of
great
indignation
and
holding
pen
missive
in
his
hand
asked
foker
how
dared
he
bring
such
an
unchristian
message
as
a
challenge
to
a
boy
of
his
school
in
fact
pen
had
written
a
note
to
his
adversary
of
the
day
before
telling
him
that
if
after
the
chastisement
which
his
insolence
richly
deserved
he
felt
inclined
to
ask
the
reparation
which
was
usually
given
amongst
gentlemen
arthur
pendennis
friend
henry
foker
was
empowered
to
make
any
arrangements
for
the
satisfaction
of
hobnell
and
so
he
sent
you
with
the
answer
did
he
sir
foker
said
surveying
the
schoolmaster
in
his
black
coat
and
clerical
costume
if
he
had
accepted
this
wicked
challenge
i
should
have
flogged
him
wapshot
said
and
gave
foker
a
glance
which
seemed
to
say
and
i
should
like
very
much
to
flog
you
uncommon
kind
of
you
sir
i
sure
said
pen
emissary
i
told
my
principal
that
i
did
think
the
other
man
would
fight
he
continued
with
a
great
air
of
dignity
he
prefers
being
flogged
to
fighting
sir
i
dare
say
may
i
offer
you
any
refreshment
i
have
the
advantage
of
your
my
name
is
wapshot
sir
and
i
am
master
of
the
grammar
school
of
this
town
sir
cried
the
other
and
i
want
no
refreshment
sir
i
thank
you
and
have
no
desire
to
make
your
acquaintance
i
did
seek
yours
sir
i
sure
replied
foker
in
affairs
of
this
sort
you
see
i
think
it
is
a
pity
that
the
clergy
should
be
called
in
but
there
no
accounting
for
tastes
i
think
it
a
pity
that
boys
should
talk
about
committing
murder
sir
as
lightly
as
you
do
roared
the
schoolmaster
and
if
i
had
you
in
my
school
i
dare
say
you
would
teach
me
better
sir
foker
said
with
a
bow
thank
you
sir
i
finished
my
education
sir
and
ai
back
to
school
sir
when
i
do
i
remember
your
kind
offer
sir
john
show
this
gentleman
downstairs
and
of
course
as
hobnell
likes
being
thrashed
we
can
have
no
objection
sir
and
we
shall
be
very
happy
to
accommodate
him
whenever
he
comes
our
and
with
this
the
young
fellow
bowed
the
elder
gentleman
out
of
the
room
and
sate
down
and
wrote
a
note
off
to
pen
in
which
he
informed
the
latter
that
hobnell
was
not
disposed
to
fight
and
proposed
to
put
up
with
the
caning
which
pen
had
administered
to
him
chapter
xvi
more
storms
in
the
puddle
pen
conduct
in
this
business
of
course
was
soon
made
public
and
angered
his
friend
doctor
portman
not
a
little
while
it
only
amused
major
pendennis
as
for
the
good
pendennis
she
was
almost
distracted
when
she
heard
of
the
squabble
and
of
pen
unchristian
behaviour
all
sorts
of
wretchedness
discomfort
crime
annoyance
seemed
to
come
out
of
this
transaction
in
which
the
luckless
boy
had
engaged
and
she
longed
more
than
ever
to
see
him
out
of
chatteris
for
a
while
anywhere
removed
from
the
woman
who
had
brought
him
into
so
much
trouble
pen
when
remonstrated
with
by
this
fond
parent
and
angrily
rebuked
by
the
doctor
for
his
violence
and
ferocious
intentions
took
the
matter
au
grand
serieux
with
the
happy
conceit
and
gravity
of
youth
said
that
he
himself
was
very
sorry
for
the
affair
that
the
insult
had
come
upon
him
without
the
slightest
provocation
on
his
part
that
he
would
permit
no
man
to
insult
him
upon
this
head
without
vindicating
his
own
honour
and
appealing
with
great
dignity
to
his
uncle
asked
whether
he
could
have
acted
otherwise
as
a
gentleman
than
as
he
did
in
resenting
the
outrage
offered
to
him
and
in
offering
satisfaction
to
the
person
chastised
vous
allez
trop
vite
my
good
sir
said
the
uncle
rather
puzzled
for
he
had
been
indoctrinating
his
nephew
with
some
of
his
own
notions
upon
the
point
of
honour
notions
savouring
of
the
camp
and
pistol
a
great
deal
more
than
our
soberer
opinions
of
the
present
day
between
men
of
the
world
i
do
say
but
between
two
schoolboys
this
sort
of
thing
is
ridiculous
my
dear
boy
perfectly
it
is
extremely
wicked
and
unlike
my
son
said
pendennis
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
bewildered
with
the
obstinacy
of
the
boy
pen
kissed
her
and
said
with
great
pomposity
women
dear
mother
do
understand
these
matters
i
put
myself
into
foker
hands
i
had
no
other
course
to
major
pendennis
grinned
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
young
ones
were
certainly
making
great
progress
he
thought
pendennis
declared
that
that
foker
was
a
wicked
horrid
little
wretch
and
was
sure
that
he
would
lead
her
dear
boy
into
mischief
if
pen
went
to
the
same
college
with
him
i
have
a
great
mind
not
to
let
him
go
at
all
she
said
and
only
that
she
remembered
that
the
lad
father
had
always
destined
him
for
the
college
in
which
he
had
had
his
own
brief
education
very
likely
the
fond
mother
would
have
put
a
veto
upon
his
going
to
the
university
that
he
was
to
go
and
at
the
next
october
term
had
been
arranged
between
all
the
authorities
who
presided
over
the
lad
welfare
foker
had
promised
to
introduce
him
to
the
right
set
and
major
pendennis
laid
great
store
upon
pen
introduction
into
college
life
and
society
by
this
admirable
young
gentleman
mr
foker
knows
the
very
best
young
men
now
at
the
university
the
major
said
and
pen
will
form
acquaintances
there
who
will
be
of
the
greatest
advantage
through
life
to
him
the
young
marquis
of
plinlimmon
is
there
eldest
son
of
the
duke
of
saint
david
lord
magnus
charters
is
there
lord
runnymede
son
and
a
first
cousin
of
foker
lady
runnymede
my
dear
was
lady
agatha
milton
you
of
course
remember
lady
agnes
will
certainly
invite
him
to
logwood
and
far
from
being
alarmed
at
his
intimacy
with
her
son
who
is
a
singular
and
humorous
but
most
prudent
and
amiable
young
man
to
whom
i
am
sure
we
are
under
every
obligation
for
his
admirable
conduct
in
the
affair
of
the
fotheringay
marriage
i
look
upon
it
as
one
of
the
very
luckiest
things
which
could
have
happened
to
pen
that
he
should
have
formed
an
intimacy
with
this
most
amusing
young
helen
sighed
she
supposed
the
major
knew
best
foker
had
been
very
kind
in
the
wretched
business
with
miss
costigan
certainly
and
she
was
grateful
to
him
but
she
could
not
feel
otherwise
than
a
dim
presentiment
of
evil
and
all
these
quarrels
and
riots
and
worldliness
scared
her
about
the
fate
of
her
boy
doctor
portman
was
decidedly
of
opinion
that
pen
should
go
to
college
he
hoped
the
lad
would
read
and
have
a
moderate
indulgence
of
the
best
society
too
he
was
of
opinion
that
pen
would
distinguish
himself
smirke
spoke
very
highly
of
his
proficiency
the
doctor
himself
had
heard
him
construe
and
thought
he
acquitted
himself
remarkably
well
that
he
should
go
out
of
chatteris
was
a
great
point
at
any
rate
and
pen
who
was
distracted
from
his
private
grief
by
the
various
rows
and
troubles
which
had
risen
round
about
him
gloomily
said
he
would
obey
there
were
assizes
races
and
the
entertainments
and
the
flux
of
company
consequent
upon
them
at
chatteris
during
a
part
of
the
months
of
august
and
september
and
miss
fotheringay
still
continued
to
act
and
take
farewell
of
the
audiences
at
the
chatteris
theatre
during
that
time
nobody
seemed
to
be
particularly
affected
by
her
presence
or
her
announced
departure
except
those
persons
whom
we
have
named
nor
could
the
polite
county
folks
who
had
houses
in
london
and
very
likely
admired
the
fotheringay
prodigiously
in
the
capital
when
they
had
been
taught
to
do
so
by
the
fashion
which
set
in
in
her
favour
find
anything
remarkable
in
the
actress
performing
on
the
little
chatteris
boards
many
genius
and
many
a
quack
for
that
matter
has
met
with
a
similar
fate
before
and
since
miss
costigan
time
this
honest
woman
meanwhile
bore
up
against
the
public
neglect
and
any
other
crosses
or
vexations
which
she
might
have
in
life
with
her
usual
equanimity
and
ate
drank
acted
slept
with
that
regularity
and
comfort
which
belongs
to
people
of
her
temperament
what
a
deal
of
grief
care
and
other
harmful
excitement
does
a
healthy
dulness
and
cheerful
insensibility
avoid
nor
do
i
mean
to
say
that
virtue
is
not
virtue
because
it
is
never
tempted
to
go
astray
only
that
dulness
is
a
much
finer
gift
than
we
give
it
credit
for
being
and
that
some
people
are
very
lucky
whom
nature
has
endowed
with
a
good
store
of
that
great
anodyne
pen
used
to
go
drearily
in
and
out
from
the
play
at
chatteris
during
this
season
and
pretty
much
according
to
his
fancy
his
proceedings
tortured
his
mother
not
a
little
and
her
anxiety
would
have
led
her
often
to
interfere
had
not
the
major
constantly
checked
and
at
the
same
time
encouraged
her
for
the
wily
man
of
the
world
fancied
he
saw
that
a
favourable
turn
had
occurred
in
pen
malady
it
was
the
violent
efflux
of
versification
among
other
symptoms
which
gave
pen
guardian
and
physician
satisfaction
he
might
be
heard
spouting
verses
in
the
shrubbery
walks
or
muttering
them
between
his
teeth
as
he
sat
with
the
home
party
of
evenings
one
day
prowling
about
the
house
in
absence
the
major
found
a
great
book
full
of
verses
in
the
lad
study
they
were
in
english
and
in
latin
quotations
from
the
classic
authors
were
given
in
the
scholastic
manner
in
the
he
ca
be
very
bad
wisely
thought
the
philosopher
and
he
made
pen
mother
remark
not
perhaps
without
a
secret
feeling
of
disappointment
for
she
loved
romance
like
other
soft
women
that
the
young
gentleman
during
the
last
fortnight
came
home
quite
hungry
to
dinner
at
night
and
also
showed
a
very
decent
appetite
at
the
in
the
morning
gad
i
wish

the
major
thinking
ruefully
of
his
dinner
pills
the
boy

to
sleep
well
depend
upon
it
was
cruel
but
it
was
true
having
no
other
soul
to
confide
in
for
he
could
not
speak
to
his
mother
of
his
loves
and
disappointments
his
uncle
treated
them
in
a
scornful
and
worldly
tone
which
though
carefully
guarded
and
polite
yet
jarred
greatly
on
the
feelings
of
mr
pen
and
foker
was
much
too
coarse
to
appreciate
those
refined
sentimental
secrets
the
lad
friendship
for
the
curate
redoubled
or
rather
he
was
never
tired
of
having
smirke
for
a
listener
on
that
one
subject

lovee
without
a
confidant

as

to
cut
out
his
mistress
name
upon
he
made
him
echo
with
the
name
of
the
beautiful
amaryllis
when
men
have
left
off
playing
the
tune
they
do
not
care
much
for
the
pipe
but
pen
thought
he
had
a
great
friendship
for
smirke
because
he
could
sigh
out
his
loves
and
griefs
into
his
tutor
ears
and
smirke
had
his
own
reasons
for
always
being
ready
at
the
lad
call
pen
affection
gushed
out
in
a
multitude
of
sonnets
to
the
friend
of
his
heart
as
he
styled
the
curate
which
the
other
received
with
great
sympathy
he
plied
smirke
with
latin
sapphics
and
alcaics
the
multiplied
under
his
fluent
pen
and
smirke
declared
and
believed
that
they
were
beautiful
on
the
other
hand
pen
expressed
a
boundless
gratitude
to
think
that
heaven
should
have
sent
him
such
a
friend
at
such
a
moment
he
presented
his
tutor
with
his
books
and
his
gold
and
wanted
him
to
take
his
gun
he
went
into
chatteris
and
got
a
gold
on
credit
for
he
had
no
money
and
indeed
was
still
in
debt
to
smirke
for
some
of
the
fotheringay
presents
which
he
presented
to
smirke
with
an
inscription
indicative
of
his
unalterable
and
eternal
regard
for
the
curate
who
of
course
was
pleased
with
every
mark
of
the
attachment
the
poor
curate
was
naturally
very
much
dismayed
at
the
contemplated
departure
of
his
pupil
when
arthur
should
go
smirke
occupation
and
delight
would
go
too
what
pretext
could
he
find
for
a
daily
visit
to
fairoaks
and
that
kind
word
or
glance
from
the
lady
there
which
was
as
necessary
to
the
curate
as
the
frugal
dinner
which
madame
fribsby
served
him
arthur
gone
he
would
only
be
allowed
to
make
visits
like
any
other
acquaintance
little
laura
could
not
accommodate
him
by
learning
the
catechism
more
than
once
a
week
he
had
curled
himself
like
ivy
round
fairoaks
he
pined
at
the
thought
that
he
must
lose
his
hold
of
the
place
should
he
speak
his
mind
and
go
down
on
his
knees
to
the
widow
he
thought
over
any
indications
in
her
behaviour
which
flattered
his
hopes
she
had
praised
his
sermons
three
weeks
before
she
had
thanked
him
exceedingly
for
his
present
of
a
melon
for
a
small
which
pendennis
gave
she
said
she
should
always
be
grateful
to
him
for
his
kindness
to
arthur
and
when
he
declared
that
there
were
no
bounds
to
his
love
and
affection
for
that
dear
boy
she
had
certainly
replied
in
a
romantic
manner
indicating
her
own
strong
gratitude
and
regard
to
all
her
son
friends
should
he
speak
out
or
should
he
delay
if
he
spoke
and
she
refused
him
it
was
awful
to
think
that
the
gate
of
fairoaks
might
be
shut
upon
him
for
ever
and
within
that
door
lay
all
the
world
for
smirke
thus
oh
friendly
readers
we
see
how
every
man
in
the
world
has
his
own
private
griefs
and
business
by
which
he
is
more
cast
down
or
occupied
than
by
the
affairs
or
sorrows
of
any
other
person
while
pendennis
is
disquieting
herself
about
losing
her
son
and
that
anxious
hold
she
has
had
of
him
as
long
as
he
has
remained
in
the
mother
nest
whence
he
is
about
to
take
flight
into
the
great
world
beyond
while
the
major
great
soul
chafes
and
frets
inwardly
vexed
as
he
thinks
what
great
parties
are
going
on
in
london
and
that
he
might
be
sunning
himself
in
the
glances
of
dukes
and
duchesses
but
for
those
cursed
affairs
which
keep
him
in
a
wretched
little
country
hole
while
pen
is
tossing
between
his
passion
and
a
more
agreeable
sensation
unacknowledged
yet
but
swaying
him
considerably
namely
his
longing
to
see
the
world
smirke
has
a
private
care
watching
at
his
bedside
and
sitting
behind
him
on
his
pony
and
is
no
more
satisfied
than
the
rest
of
us
how
lonely
we
are
in
the
world
how
selfish
and
secret
everybody
you
and
your
wife
have
pressed
the
same
pillow
for
forty
years
and
fancy
yourselves
united
psha
does
she
cry
out
when
you
have
the
gout
or
do
you
lie
awake
when
she
has
the
toothache
your
artless
daughter
seemingly
all
innocence
and
devoted
to
her
mamma
and
her
is
thinking
of
neither
but
of
the
young
lieutenant
with
whom
she
danced
at
the
last
ball
the
honest
frank
boy
just
returned
from
school
is
secretly
speculating
upon
the
money
you
will
give
him
and
the
debts
he
owes
the
the
old
grandmother
crooning
in
the
corner
and
bound
to
another
world
within
a
few
months
has
some
business
or
cares
which
are
quite
private
and
her
own
very
likely
she
is
thinking
of
fifty
years
back
and
that
night
when
she
made
such
an
impression
and
danced
a
cotillon
with
the
captain
before
your
father
proposed
for
her
or
what
a
silly
little
overrated
creature
your
wife
is
and
how
absurdly
you
are
infatuated
about
her
and
as
for
your
wife
o
philosophic
reader
answer
and
say
do
you
tell
her
all
ah
sir
a
distinct
universe
walks
about
under
your
hat
and
under
mine
all
things
in
nature
are
different
to
each
the
woman
we
look
at
has
not
the
same
features
the
dish
we
eat
from
has
not
the
same
taste
to
the
one
and
the
other
you
and
i
are
but
a
pair
of
infinite
isolations
with
some
a
little
more
or
less
near
to
us
let
us
return
however
to
the
solitary
smirke
smirke
had
one
confidante
for
his
passion
that
most
injudicious
woman
madame
fribsby
how
she
became
madame
fribsby
nobody
knows
she
had
left
clavering
to
go
to
a
milliner
in
london
as
miss
fribsby
she
pretended
that
she
had
got
the
rank
in
paris
during
her
residence
in
that
city
but
how
could
the
french
king
were
he
ever
so
much
disposed
give
her
any
such
title
we
shall
not
inquire
into
this
mystery
however
suffice
to
say
she
went
away
from
home
a
bouncing
young
lass
she
returned
a
rather
elderly
character
with
a
madonna
front
and
a
melancholy
countenance
bought
the
late
harbottle
business
for
a
song
took
her
elderly
mother
to
live
with
her
was
very
good
to
the
poor
was
constant
at
church
and
had
the
best
of
characters
but
there
was
no
one
in
all
clavering
not
portman
herself
who
read
so
many
novels
as
madame
fribsby
she
had
plenty
of
time
for
this
amusement
for
in
truth
very
few
people
besides
the
folks
at
the
rectory
and
fairoaks
employed
her
and
by
a
perpetual
perusal
of
such
works
which
were
by
no
means
so
moral
or
edifying
in
the
days
of
which
we
write
as
they
are
at
present
she
had
got
to
be
so
absurdly
sentimental
that
in
her
eyes
life
was
nothing
but
an
immense
and
she
never
could
see
two
people
together
but
she
fancied
they
were
dying
for
one
another
on
the
day
after
pendennis
visit
to
the
curate
which
we
have
recorded
many
pages
back
madame
fribsby
settled
in
her
mind
that
smirke
must
be
in
love
with
the
widow
and
did
everything
in
her
power
to
encourage
this
passion
on
both
sides
pendennis
she
very
seldom
saw
indeed
except
in
public
and
in
her
pew
at
church
that
lady
had
very
little
need
of
millinery
or
made
most
of
her
own
dresses
and
caps
but
on
the
rare
occasions
when
madame
fribsby
received
visits
from
pendennis
or
paid
her
respects
at
fairoaks
she
never
failed
to
entertain
the
widow
with
praises
of
the
curate
pointing
out
what
an
angelical
man
he
was
how
gentle
how
studious
how
lonely
and
she
would
wonder
that
no
lady
would
take
pity
upon
him
helen
laughed
at
these
sentimental
remarks
and
wondered
that
madame
herself
did
not
compassionate
her
lodger
and
console
him
madame
fribsby
shook
her
madonna
front
mong
cure
a
boco
souffare
she
said
laying
her
hand
on
the
part
she
designated
as
her
cure
it
est
more
en
espang
madame
she
said
with
a
sigh
she
was
proud
of
her
intimacy
with
the
french
language
and
spoke
it
with
more
volubility
than
correctness
pendennis
did
not
care
to
penetrate
the
secrets
of
this
wounded
heart
except
to
her
few
intimates
she
was
a
reserved
and
it
may
be
a
very
proud
woman
she
looked
upon
her
son
tutor
merely
as
an
attendant
on
that
young
prince
to
be
treated
with
respect
as
a
clergyman
certainly
but
with
proper
dignity
as
a
dependant
on
the
house
of
pendennis
nor
were
madame
constant
allusions
to
the
curate
particularly
agreeable
to
her
it
required
a
very
ingenious
sentimental
turn
indeed
to
find
out
that
the
widow
had
a
secret
regard
for
smirke
to
which
pernicious
error
however
madame
fribsby
persisted
in
holding
her
lodger
was
very
much
more
willing
to
talk
on
this
subject
with
his
landlady
every
time
after
that
she
praised
the
curate
to
pendennis
she
came
away
from
the
latter
with
the
notion
that
the
widow
herself
had
been
praising
him
etre
soul
au
monde
est
bien
ouneeyoung
she
would
say
glancing
up
at
a
print
of
a
french
carbineer
in
a
green
coat
and
brass
cuirass
which
decorated
her
apartment
depend
upon
it
when
master
pendennis
goes
to
college
his
ma
will
find
herself
very
lonely
she
is
quite
young
you
would
suppose
her
to
be
monsieur
le
cury
song
cure
est
touchy
suis
sure
je
conny
cela
biang
ally
monsieur
he
softly
blushed
he
sighed
he
hoped
he
feared
he
doubted
he
sometimes
yielded
to
the
delightful
idea
his
pleasure
was
to
sit
in
madame
fribsby
apartment
and
talk
upon
the
subject
where
as
the
greater
part
of
the
conversation
was
carried
on
in
french
by
the
milliner
and
her
old
mother
was
deaf
that
retired
old
individual
who
had
once
been
a
housekeeper
wife
and
widow
of
a
butler
in
the
clavering
family
could
understand
scarce
one
syllable
of
their
talk
thus
it
was
that
when
major
pendennis
announced
to
his
nephew
tutor
that
the
young
fellow
would
go
to
college
in
october
and
that
smirke
valuable
services
would
no
longer
be
needful
to
his
pupil
for
which
services
the
major
who
spoke
as
grandly
as
a
lord
professed
himself
exceedingly
grateful
and
besought
smirke
to
command
his
interests
in
any
way
thus
it
was
that
the
curate
felt
that
the
critical
moment
was
come
for
him
and
was
racked
and
tortured
by
those
severe
pangs
which
the
occasion
warranted
madame
fribsby
had
of
course
taken
the
strongest
interest
in
the
progress
of
mr
pen
love
affair
with
miss
fotheringay
she
had
been
over
to
chatteris
and
having
seen
that
actress
perform
had
pronounced
that
she
was
old
and
overrated
and
had
talked
over
master
pen
passion
in
her
shop
many
and
many
a
time
to
the
old
maids
and
old
women
in
male
clothes
who
are
to
be
found
in
little
country
towns
and
who
formed
the
genteel
population
of
clavering
captain
glanders
had
pronounced
that
pen
was
going
to
be
a
devil
of
a
fellow
and
had
begun
early
glanders
had
told
him
to
check
his
horrid
observations
and
to
respect
his
own
wife
if
he
pleased
she
said
it
would
be
a
lesson
to
helen
for
her
pride
and
absurd
infatuation
about
that
boy
pybus
said
many
people
were
proud
of
very
small
things
and
for
her
part
she
did
know
why
an
apothecary
wife
should
give
herself
such
airs
wapshot
called
her
daughters
away
from
that
side
of
the
street
one
day
when
pen
on
rebecca
was
stopping
at
the
saddler
to
get
a
new
lash
to
his
whip
one
and
all
of
these
people
had
made
visits
of
curiosity
to
fairoaks
and
had
tried
to
condole
with
the
widow
or
bring
the
subject
of
the
fotheringay
affair
on
the
tapis
and
had
been
severally
checked
by
the
haughty
reserve
of
pendennis
supported
by
the
frigid
politeness
of
the
major
her
brother
these
rebuffs
however
did
not
put
an
end
to
the
gossip
and
slander
went
on
increasing
about
the
unlucky
fairoaks

in
a
manner
which
made
it
clear
to
every
capacity
that

was
the
individual

on
the
road
alluded
to
what
stories

in

pronounced
to

as
well
as

his
name
became

name
of
terror

a
byword
in

this
was
not
all
he
was
not
the
only
one
of
the

about
whom
the

began
to
chatter

said
as
the
good
wife
entered
madame
fribsby
shop
to
inspect
her
monthly
book
of
fashions
just
arrived
from
london
and
the
fact
is
that
madame
fribsby
had
been
able
to
hold
out
no
longer
and
one
day
after
she
and
her
lodger
had
been
talking
of
pen
approaching
departure
and
the
curate
had
gone
off
to
give
one
of
his
last
lessons
to
that
gentleman
madame
fribsby
had
communicated
to
pybus
who
happened
to
step
in
with
speers
her
strong
suspicion
her
certainty
almost
that
there
was
an
attachment
between
a
certain
clerical
gentleman
and
a
certain
lady
whose
naughty
son
was
growing
quite
unmanageable
and
that
a
certain
marriage
would
take
place
pretty
soon
portman
saw
it
all
of
course
when
the
matter
was
mentioned
what
a
sly
fox
that
curate
was
he
was
and
she
never
liked
him
and
to
think
of
pendennis
taking
a
fancy
to
him
after
she
had
been
married
to
such
a
man
as
pendennis
she
could
hardly
stay
five
minutes
at
madame
fribsby
so
eager
was
she
to
run
to
the
rectory
and
give
doctor
portman
the
news
when
doctor
portman
heard
this
piece
of
intelligence
he
was
in
such
a
rage
with
his
curate
that
his
first
movement
was
to
break
with
smirke
and
to
beg
him
to
transfer
his
services
to
some
other
parish
that
milksop
of
a
creature
pretend
to
be
worthy
of
such
a
woman
as
pendennis
broke
out
the
doctor
where
will
impudence
stop
next
she
is
much
too
old
for
smirke
portman
remarked
why
poor
dear
pendennis
might
be
his
mother
you
always
choose
the
most
charitable
reason
betsy
cried
the
rector
a
matron
with
a
son
grown
up
she
would
never
think
of
marrying
you
only
think
men
should
marry
again
doctor
portman
answered
his
lady
bridling
up
you
stupid
old
woman
said
the
doctor
when
i
am
gone
you
shall
marry
whomsoever
you
like
i
will
leave
orders
in
my
will
my
dear
to
that
effect
and
i
bequeath
a
ring
to
my
successor
and
my
ghost
shall
come
and
dance
at
your
it
is
cruel
for
a
clergyman
to
talk
so
the
lady
answered
with
a
ready
whimper
but
these
little
breezes
used
to
pass
very
rapidly
over
the
surface
of
the
doctor
domestic
bliss
and
were
followed
by
a
great
calm
and
sunshine
the
doctor
adopted
a
plan
for
soothing
ruffled
countenance
which
has
a
great
effect
when
it
is
tried
between
a
worthy
couple
who
are
sincerely
fond
of
one
another
and
which
i
think
becomes
anderson
at
just
as
much
as
it
used
to
do
when
he
was
a
young
jo
of
had
you
better
speak
to
smirke
john
mrs
portman
asked
when
pen
goes
to
college
cadit
quaestio
replied
the
rector
smirke
visits
at
fairoaks
will
cease
of
themselves
and
there
will
be
no
need
to
bother
the
widow
she
has
trouble
enough
on
her
hands
with
the
affairs
of
that
silly
young
scapegrace
without
being
pestered
by
the
of
this
place
it
is
all
an
invention
of
that
fool
against
whom
i
always
warned
you
you
know
i
did
my
dear
john
interposed
portman
that
you
did
you
very
often
do
my
love
the
doctor
answered
with
a
laugh
it
is
not
for
want
of
warning
on
your
part
i
am
sure
that
i
have
formed
my
opinion
of
most
women
with
whom
we
are
acquainted
madame
fribsby
is
a
fool
and
fond
of
gossip
and
so
are
some
other
folks
but
she
is
good
to
the
poor
she
takes
care
of
her
mother
and
she
comes
to
church
twice
every
sunday
and
as
for
smirke
my
dear
here
the
doctor
face
assumed
for
one
moment
a
comical
expression
which
portman
did
not
perceive
for
she
was
looking
out
of
the
window
and
wondering
what
pybus
could
want
cheapening
fowls
again
in
the
market
when
she
had
bad
poultry
from
livermore
two
days
before
and
as
for
smirke
my
dear
betsy
will
you
promise
me
that
you
will
never
breathe
to
any
mortal
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
as
a
profound
secret
what
is
it
my
dear
john
of
course
i
wo
answered
the
lady
well
then
i
can
not
say
it
is
a
fact
mind
but
if
you
find
that
smirke
is
at
this
moment
ay
and
has
been
for
years
engaged
to
a
young
lady
a
miss
a
miss
thompson
if
you
will
have
the
name
who
lives
on
clapham
common
yes
on
clapham
common
not
far
from
house
what
becomes
of
your
story
then
about
smirke
and
pendennis
why
did
you
not
tell
me
this
before
asked
the
doctor
how
long
have
you
known
it
how
we
all
of
us
have
been
deceived
in
that
man
why
should
i
meddle
in
other
folks
business
my
dear
the
doctor
answered
i
know
how
to
keep
a
secret
and
perhaps
this
is
only
an
invention
like
that
other
absurd
story
at
least
madame
portman
i
should
never
have
told
you
this
but
for
the
other
which
i
beg
you
to
contradict
whenever
you
hear
and
so
saying
the
doctor
went
away
to
his
study
and
portman
seeing
that
the
day
was
a
remarkably
fine
one
thought
she
would
take
advantage
of
the
weather
and
pay
a
few
visits
the
doctor
looking
out
of
his
study
window
saw
the
wife
of
his
bosom
presently
issue
forth
attired
in
her
best
she
crossed
the
saluting
the
right
and
left
and
giving
a
glance
at
the
grocery
and
general
emporium
at
the
corner
then
entering
london
street
formerly
hog
lane
she
stopped
for
a
minute
at
madame
fribsby
window
and
looking
at
the
fashions
which
hung
up
there
seemed
hesitating
whether
she
should
enter
but
she
passed
on
and
never
stopped
again
until
she
came
to
pybus
little
green
gate
and
garden
through
which
she
went
to
that
lady
cottage
there
of
course
her
husband
lost
sight
of
portman
oh
what
a
long
bow
i
have
pulled
he
said
inwardly
goodness
forgive
me
and
shot
my
own
flesh
and
blood
there
must
be
no
more
tattling
and
scandal
about
that
house
i
must
stop
it
and
speak
to
smirke
i
ask
him
to
dinner
this
very
having
a
sermon
to
compose
the
doctor
sat
down
to
that
work
and
was
so
engaged
in
the
composition
that
he
had
not
concluded
it
until
near
five
in
the
afternoon
when
he
stepped
over
to
smirke
lodgings
to
put
his
hospitable
intentions
regarding
that
gentleman
into
effect
he
reached
madame
fribsby
door
just
as
the
curate
issued
from
it
smirke
was
magnificently
dressed
and
as
he
turned
out
his
toes
he
showed
a
pair
of
elegant
silk
stockings
and
glossy
pumps
his
white
cravat
was
arranged
in
a
splendid
stiff
tie
and
his
gold
shirt
studs
shone
on
his
spotless
linen
his
hair
was
curled
round
his
fair
temples
had
he
borrowed
madame
fribsby
irons
to
give
that
curly
grace
his
white
cambric
was
scented
with
the
most
delicious
o
gracilis
puer
cried
the
whither
are
you
bound
i
wanted
you
to
come
home
to
i
am
engaged
to
dine
at
at
fairoaks
said
smirke
blushing
faintly
and
whisking
the
scented
and
his
pony
being
in
waiting
he
mounted
and
rode
away
simpering
down
the
street
no
accident
befell
him
that
day
and
he
arrived
with
his
tie
in
the
very
best
order
at
pendennis
house
chapter
xvii
which
concludes
the
first
part
of
this
history
the
curate
had
gone
on
his
daily
errand
to
fairoaks
and
was
upstairs
in
pen
study
pretending
to
read
with
his
pupil
in
the
early
part
of
that
very
afternoon
when
portman
after
transacting
business
with
pybus
had
found
the
weather
so
exceedingly
fine
that
she
pursued
her
walk
as
far
as
fairoaks
in
order
to
pay
a
visit
to
her
dear
friend
there
in
the
course
of
their
conversation
the
rector
lady
told
pendennis
and
the
major
a
very
great
secret
about
the
curate
smirke
which
was
no
less
than
that
he
had
an
attachment
a
very
old
attachment
which
he
had
long
kept
quite
private
and
on
whom
is
it
that
smirke
has
bestowed
his
heart
asked
pendennis
with
a
superb
air
but
rather
an
inward
alarm
why
my
dear
the
other
lady
answered
when
he
first
came
and
used
to
dine
at
the
rectory
people
said
we
wanted
him
for
myra
and
we
were
forced
to
give
up
asking
him
then
they
used
to
say
he
was
smitten
in
another
quarter
but
i
always
contradicted
it
for
my
part
and
said
that
you
that
i
cried
pendennis
people
are
very
impertinent
i
am
sure
smirke
came
here
as
arthur
tutor
and
i
am
surprised
that
anybody
should
dare
to
speak
so
my
soul
it
is
a
little
too
much
the
major
said
laying
down
the
newspaper
and
the
double
i
no
patience
with
that
pybus
helen
continued
indignantly
i
told
her
there
was
no
truth
in
it
portman
said
i
always
said
so
my
dear
and
now
it
comes
out
that
my
demure
gentleman
has
been
engaged
to
a
young
lady
miss
thompson
of
clapham
common
ever
so
long
and
i
am
delighted
for
my
part
and
on
myra
account
too
for
an
unmarried
curate
is
always
objectionable
about
one
house
and
of
course
it
is
strictly
private
but
i
thought
i
would
tell
you
as
it
might
remove
unpleasantnesses
but
mind
not
one
word
if
you
please
about
the
pendennis
said
with
perfect
sincerity
that
she
was
exceedingly
glad
to
hear
the
news
and
hoped
smirke
who
was
a
very
kind
and
amiable
man
would
have
a
deserving
wife
and
when
her
visitor
went
away
helen
and
her
brother
talked
of
the
matter
with
great
satisfaction
the
kind
lady
rebuking
herself
for
her
haughty
behaviour
to
smirke
whom
she
had
avoided
of
late
instead
of
being
grateful
to
him
for
his
constant
attention
to
arthur
gratitude
to
this
kind
of
people
the
major
said
is
very
well
but
familiarity
is
out
of
the
question
this
gentleman
gives
his
lessons
and
receives
his
money
like
any
other
master
you
are
too
humble
my
good
soul
there
must
be
distinctions
in
ranks
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
told
you
before
you
were
too
kind
to
but
helen
did
not
think
so
and
now
that
arthur
was
going
away
and
she
bethought
her
how
very
polite
smirke
had
been
how
he
had
gone
on
messages
for
her
how
he
had
brought
books
and
copied
music
how
he
had
taught
laura
so
many
things
and
given
her
so
many
kind
presents
her
heart
smote
her
on
account
of
her
ingratitude
towards
the
curate
so
much
so
that
when
he
came
down
from
study
with
pen
and
was
hankering
about
the
hall
previous
to
his
departure
she
went
out
and
shook
hands
with
him
with
rather
a
blushing
face
and
begged
him
to
come
into
her
where
she
said
they
now
never
saw
him
and
as
there
was
to
be
rather
a
good
dinner
that
day
she
invited
smirke
to
partake
of
it
and
we
may
be
sure
that
he
was
too
happy
to
accept
such
a
delightful
summons
eased
by
the
above
report
of
all
her
former
doubts
and
misgivings
regarding
the
curate
helen
was
exceedingly
kind
and
gracious
to
smirke
during
dinner
redoubling
her
attentions
perhaps
because
major
pendennis
was
very
high
and
reserved
with
his
nephew
tutor
when
pendennis
asked
smirke
to
drink
wine
he
addressed
him
as
if
he
was
a
sovereign
speaking
to
a
petty
retainer
in
a
manner
so
condescending
that
even
pen
laughed
at
it
although
quite
ready
for
his
part
to
be
as
conceited
as
most
young
men
are
but
smirke
did
not
care
for
the
impertinences
of
the
major
so
long
as
he
had
his
hostess
kind
behaviour
and
he
passed
a
delightful
time
by
her
side
at
table
exerting
all
his
powers
of
conversation
to
please
her
talking
in
a
manner
both
clerical
and
worldly
about
the
fancy
bazaar
and
the
great
missionary
meeting
about
the
last
new
novel
and
the
bishop
excellent
sermon
about
the
fashionable
parties
in
london
an
account
of
which
he
read
in
the
newspapers
in
fine
he
neglected
no
art
by
which
a
college
divine
who
has
both
sprightly
and
serious
talents
a
taste
for
the
genteel
an
irreproachable
conduct
and
a
susceptible
heart
will
try
and
make
himself
agreeable
to
the
person
on
whom
he
has
fixed
his
affections
major
pendennis
came
yawning
out
of
the
very
soon
after
his
sister
and
little
laura
had
left
the
apartment
what
an
unsufferable
bore
that
man
is
and
how
he
did
talk
the
major
said
he
has
been
very
good
to
arthur
who
is
very
fond
of
him
pendennis
said
i
wonder
who
the
miss
thompson
is
whom
he
is
going
to
marry
i
always
thought
the
fellow
was
looking
in
another
direction
said
the
major
and
in
what
asked
pendennis
quite
innocently
towards
myra
portman
towards
helen
pendennis
if
you
must
know
answered
her
towards
me
impossible
helen
said
who
knew
perfectly
well
that
such
had
been
the
case
his
marriage
will
be
a
very
happy
thing
i
hope
arthur
will
not
take
too
much
now
arthur
flushed
with
a
good
deal
of
pride
at
the
privilege
of
having
the
keys
of
the
cellar
and
remembering
that
a
very
few
more
dinners
would
probably
take
place
which
he
and
his
dear
friend
smirke
could
share
had
brought
up
a
liberal
supply
of
claret
for
the
drinking
and
when
the
elders
with
little
laura
left
him
he
and
the
curate
began
to
pass
the
wine
very
freely
one
bottle
speedily
yielded
up
the
ghost
another
shed
more
than
half
its
blood
before
the
two
topers
had
been
much
more
than
half
an
hour
together
pen
with
a
hollow
laugh
and
voice
had
drunk
off
one
bumper
to
the
falsehood
of
women
and
had
said
sardonically
that
wine
at
any
rate
was
a
mistress
who
never
deceived
and
was
sure
to
give
a
man
a
welcome
smirke
gently
said
that
he
knew
for
his
part
some
women
who
were
all
truth
and
tenderness
and
casting
up
his
eyes
towards
the
ceiling
and
heaving
a
sigh
as
if
evoking
some
being
dear
and
unmentionable
he
took
up
his
glass
and
drained
it
and
the
rosy
liquor
began
to
suffuse
his
face
pen
trolled
over
some
verses
he
had
been
making
that
morning
in
which
he
informed
himself
that
the
woman
who
had
slighted
his
passion
could
not
be
worthy
to
win
it
that
he
was
awaking
from
love
mad
fever
and
of
course
under
these
circumstances
proceeded
to
leave
her
and
to
quit
a
heartless
deceiver
that
a
name
which
had
one
day
been
famous
in
the
land
might
again
be
heard
in
it
and
that
though
he
never
should
be
the
happy
and
careless
boy
he
was
but
a
few
months
since
or
his
heart
be
what
it
had
been
ere
passion
had
filled
it
and
grief
had
killed
it
that
though
to
him
personally
death
was
as
welcome
as
life
and
that
he
would
not
hesitate
to
part
with
the
latter
but
for
the
love
of
one
kind
being
whose
happiness
depended
on
his
own
yet
he
hoped
to
show
he
was
a
man
worthy
of
his
race
and
that
one
day
the
false
one
should
be
brought
to
know
how
great
was
the
treasure
and
noble
the
heart
which
she
had
flung
away
pen
we
say
who
was
a
very
excitable
person
rolled
out
these
verses
in
his
rich
sweet
voice
which
trembled
with
emotion
whilst
our
young
poet
spoke
he
had
a
trick
of
blushing
when
in
this
excited
state
and
his
large
and
honest
grey
eyes
also
exhibited
proofs
of
a
sensibility
so
genuine
hearty
and
manly
that
miss
costigan
if
she
had
a
heart
must
needs
have
softened
towards
him
and
very
likely
she
was
as
he
said
altogether
unworthy
of
the
affection
which
he
lavished
upon
her
the
sentimental
smirke
was
caught
by
the
emotion
which
agitated
his
young
friend
he
grasped
pen
hand
over
the
dessert
dishes
and
he
said
the
verses
were
beautiful
that
pen
was
a
poet
a
great
poet
and
likely
by
heaven
permission
to
run
a
great
career
in
the
world
go
on
and
prosper
dear
arthur
he
cried
the
wounds
under
which
at
present
you
suffer
are
only
temporary
and
the
very
grief
you
endure
will
cleanse
and
strengthen
your
heart
i
have
always
prophesied
the
greatest
and
brightest
things
of
you
as
soon
as
you
have
corrected
some
failings
and
weaknesses
of
character
which
at
present
belong
to
you
but
you
will
get
over
these
my
boy
you
will
get
over
these
and
when
you
are
famous
and
celebrated
as
i
know
you
will
be
will
you
remember
your
old

arthur
said
smirke
looking
through
his
spectacles
and
his
heart
began
to
beat
so
that
he
thought
pen
must
almost
hear
it
throbbing
my
best
friend
my
friend
for
ever
pen
said
god
bless
you
old
boy
and
he
drank
up
the
last
glass
of
the
second
bottle
of
the
famous
wine
which
his
father
had
laid
in
which
his
uncle
had
bought
which
lord
levant
had
imported
and
which
now
like
a
slave
indifferent
was
ministering
pleasure
to
its
present
owner
and
giving
its
young
master
delectation

mr

began
to
sing
the
drinking
song
out
of
der
freischuetz
the
windows
were
open
and
his
mother
was
softly
pacing
on
the
lawn
outside
while
little
laura
was
looking
at
the
sunset
the
sweet
fresh
notes
of
the
boy
voice
came
to
the
widow
it
cheered
her
kind
heart
to
hear
him
sing

smirke
and
his
beautiful
cambric
shirt

and
glistening
studs

with
the
emotion
which
agitated
his
gentle
and
suffering
bosom

smirke

hip
hip
hurray
smirke
convulsively
gulped
down
his
glass
of
wine
and
pen
waved
his
over
his
head
cheering
so
as
to
make
his
mother
and
laura
wonder
on
the
lawn
and
his
uncle
who
was
dozing
over
the
paper
in
the
start
and
say
to
himself
that
boy

smirke
put
down

out
the
blushing
curate

wish

joy
she
got
a
large
waist
but
i
wish
you
joy

oh
arthur
groaned
the
curate
again
and
nodded
his
head
speechless
beg
your
pardon
sorry
i
offended
you
but
she
has
got
a
large
waist
you
know
devilish
large
waist
pen
continued
the
third
bottle
evidently
beginning
to
act
upon
the
young
gentleman
it
not
miss
portman
the
other
said
in
a
voice
of
agony
is
it
anybody
at
chatteris
or
at
clapham
somebody
here
no
it
old
pybus
it
ca
be
miss
rolt
at
the
factory
she
only
it
somebody
rather
older
than
i
am
pen
the
curate
cried
looking
up
at
his
friend
and
then
guiltily
casting
his
eyes
down
into
his
plate
pen
burst
out
laughing
it
madame
fribsby
by
jove
it
madame
fribsby
madame
frib
by
the
immortal
gods
the
curate
could
contain
no
more
o
pen
he
cried
how
can
you
suppose
that
any
of
those
of
those
more
than
ordinary
beings
you
have
named
could
have
an
influence
upon
this
heart
when
i
have
been
daily
in
the
habit
of
contemplating
perfection
i
may
be
insane
i
may
be
madly
ambitious
i
may
be
presumptuous
but
for
two
years
my
heart
has
been
filled
by
one
image
and
has
known
no
other
idol
have
i
loved
you
as
a
son
arthur
say
has
charles
smirke
loved
you
as
a
son
yes
old
boy
you
been
very
good
to
me
pen
said
whose
liking
however
for
his
tutor
was
not
by
any
means
of
the
filial
kind
my
means
rushed
on
smirke
are
at
present
limited
i
own
and
my
mother
is
not
so
liberal
as
might
be
desired
but
what
she
has
will
be
mine
at
her
death
were
she
to
hear
of
my
marrying
a
lady
of
rank
and
good
fortune
my
mother
would
be
liberal
i
am
sure
she
would
be
liberal
whatever
i
have
or
subsequently
inherit
and
it
five
hundred
a
year
at
the
very
least
would
be
settled
upon
her
and
and
and
you
at
my
death
that
what
the
deuce
do
you
mean
and
what
have
i
to
do
with
your
money
cried
out
pen
in
a
puzzle
arthur
arthur
exclaimed
the
other
wildly
you
say
i
am
your
dearest
friend
let
me
be
more
oh
ca
you
see
that
the
angelic
being
i
love
the
purest
the
best
of
women
is
no
other
than
your
dear
dear
angel
of
a
my
mother
cried
out
arthur
jumping
up
and
sober
in
a
minute
pooh
damn
it
smirke
you
must
be
mad
she
seven
or
eight
years
older
than
you
did
you
find
that
any
objection
cried
smirke
piteously
and
alluding
of
course
to
the
elderly
subject
of
pen
own
passion
the
lad
felt
the
hint
and
blushed
quite
red
the
cases
are
not
similar
smirke
he
said
and
the
allusion
might
have
been
spared
a
man
may
forget
his
own
rank
and
elevate
any
woman
to
it
but
allow
me
to
say
our
positions
are
very
how
do
you
mean
dear
arthur
the
curate
interposed
sadly
cowering
as
he
felt
that
his
sentence
was
about
to
be
read
mean
said
arthur
i
mean
what
i
say
my
tutor
i
say
my
tutor
has
no
right
to
ask
a
lady
of
my
mother
rank
of
life
to
marry
him
a
breach
of
confidence
i
say
it
a
liberty
you
take
smirke
it
a
liberty
mean
indeed
o
arthur
the
curate
began
to
cry
with
clasped
hands
and
a
scared
face
but
arthur
gave
another
stamp
with
his
foot
and
began
to
pull
at
the
bell
do
let
have
any
more
of
this
we
have
some
coffee
if
you
please
he
said
with
a
majestic
air
and
the
old
butler
entering
at
the
summons
arthur
bade
him
to
serve
that
refreshment
john
said
he
had
just
carried
coffee
into
the
where
his
uncle
was
asking
for
master
arthur
and
the
old
man
gave
a
glance
of
wonder
at
the
three
empty
smirke
said
he
thought
he
he
rather
not
go
into
the
on
which
arthur
haughtily
said
as
you
please
and
called
for
smirke
horse
to
be
brought
round
the
poor
fellow
said
he
knew
the
way
to
the
stable
and
would
get
his
pony
himself
and
he
went
into
the
hall
and
sadly
put
on
his
coat
and
hat
pen
followed
him
out
uncovered
helen
was
still
walking
up
and
down
the
soft
lawn
as
the
sun
was
setting
and
the
curate
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
by
way
of
farewell
and
passed
on
to
the
door
leading
to
the
stable
court
by
which
the
pair
disappeared
smirke
knew
the
way
to
the
stable
as
he
said
well
enough
he
fumbled
at
the
girths
of
the
saddle
which
pen
fastened
for
him
and
put
on
the
bridle
and
led
the
pony
into
the
yard
the
boy
was
touched
by
the
grief
which
appeared
in
the
face
as
he
mounted
pen
held
out
his
hand
and
smirke
wrung
it
silently
i
say
smirke
he
said
in
an
agitated
voice
forgive
me
if
i
have
said
anything
harsh
for
you
have
always
been
very
very
kind
to
me
but
it
ca
be
old
fellow
it
ca
be
be
a
man
god
bless
smirke
nodded
his
head
silently
and
rode
out
of
the
and
pen
looked
after
him
for
a
couple
of
minutes
until
he
disappeared
down
the
road
and
the
clatter
of
the
pony
hoofs
died
away
helen
was
still
lingering
on
the
lawn
waiting
until
the
boy
came
back
she
put
his
hair
off
his
forehead
and
kissed
it
fondly
she
was
afraid
he
had
been
drinking
too
much
wine
why
had
smirke
gone
away
without
any
tea
he
looked
at
her
with
a
kind
humour
beaming
in
his
eyes
smirke
is
unwell
he
said
with
a
laugh
for
a
long
while
helen
had
not
seen
the
boy
looking
so
cheerful
he
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
walked
her
up
and
down
the
walk
in
front
of
the
house
laura
began
to
drub
on
the
window
and
nod
and
laugh
from
it
come
along
you
two
people
cried
on
major
pendennis
your
coffee
is
getting
quite
when
laura
was
gone
to
bed
pen
who
was
big
with
his
secret
burst
out
with
it
and
described
the
dismal
but
ludicrous
scene
which
had
occurred
helen
heard
of
it
with
many
blushes
which
became
her
pale
face
very
well
and
a
perplexity
which
arthur
roguishly
enjoyed
confound
the
fellow
impudence
major
pendennis
said
as
he
took
his
candle
where
will
the
assurance
of
these
people
stop
pen
and
his
mother
had
a
long
talk
that
night
full
of
love
confidence
and
laughter
and
the
boy
somehow
slept
more
soundly
and
woke
up
more
easily
than
he
had
done
for
many
months
before
before
the
great
dolphin
quitted
chatteris
he
not
only
made
an
advantageous
engagement
with
miss
fotheringay
but
he
liberally
left
with
her
a
sum
of
money
to
pay
off
any
debts
which
the
little
family
might
have
contracted
during
their
stay
in
the
place
and
which
mainly
through
the
lady
own
economy
and
management
were
not
considerable
the
small
account
with
the
spirit
merchant
which
major
pendennis
had
settled
was
the
chief
of
captain
costigan
debts
and
though
the
captain
at
one
time
talked
about
repaying
every
farthing
of
the
money
it
never
appears
that
he
executed
his
menace
nor
did
the
laws
of
honour
in
the
least
call
upon
him
to
accomplish
that
threat
when
miss
costigan
had
seen
all
the
outstanding
bills
paid
to
the
uttermost
shilling
she
handed
over
the
balance
to
her
father
who
broke
out
into
hospitalities
to
all
his
friends
gave
the
little
creeds
more
apples
and
gingerbread
than
he
had
ever
bestowed
upon
them
so
that
the
widow
creed
ever
after
held
the
memory
of
her
lodger
in
veneration
and
the
young
ones
wept
bitterly
when
he
went
away
and
in
a
word
managed
the
money
so
cleverly
that
it
was
entirely
expended
before
many
days
and
that
he
was
compelled
to
draw
upon
dolphin
for
a
sum
to
pay
for
travelling
expenses
when
the
time
of
their
departure
arrived
there
was
held
at
an
inn
in
that
county
town
a
weekly
meeting
of
a
festive
almost
a
riotous
character
of
a
society
of
gentlemen
who
called
themselves
the
buccaneers
some
of
the
choice
spirits
of
chatteris
belonged
to
this
cheerful
club
graves
the
apothecary
than
whom
a
better
fellow
never
put
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
smoked
it
smart
the
talented
and
humorous
of
high
street
croker
an
excellent
auctioneer
and
the
uncompromising
hicks
the
able
editor
for
years
of
the
county
chronicle
and
chatteris
champion
were
amongst
the
crew
of
the
buccaneers
whom
also
bingley
the
manager
liked
to
join
of
a
saturday
evening
whenever
he
received
permission
from
his
lady
costigan
had
been
also
an
occasional
buccaneer
but
a
want
of
punctuality
of
payments
had
of
late
somewhat
excluded
him
from
the
society
where
he
was
subject
to
disagreeable
remarks
from
the
landlord
who
said
that
a
buccaneer
who
did
pay
his
shot
was
utterly
unworthy
to
be
a
marine
bandit
but
when
it
became
known
to
the
as
the
clubbists
called
themselves
familiarly
that
miss
fotheringay
had
made
a
splendid
engagement
a
great
revolution
of
feeling
took
place
in
the
club
regarding
captain
costigan
solly
mine
host
of
the
grapes
and
i
need
not
say
as
worthy
a
fellow
as
ever
stood
behind
a
bar
told
the
gents
in
the
buccaneers
room
one
night
how
noble
the
captain
had
behaved
having
been
round
and
paid
off
all
his
ticks
in
chatteris
including
his
score
of
three
pound
fourteen
here
and
pronounced
that
cos
was
a
good
feller
a
gentleman
at
bottom
and
he
solly
had
always
said
so
and
finally
worked
upon
the
feelings
of
the
buccaneers
to
give
the
captain
a
dinner
the
banquet
took
place
on
the
last
night
of
costigan
stay
at
chatteris
and
was
served
in
solly
accustomed
manner
as
good
a
plain
dinner
of
old
english
fare
as
ever
smoked
on
a
table
was
prepared
by
solly
and
about
eighteen
gentlemen
sate
down
to
the
festive
board
jubber
the
eminent
draper
of
high
street
was
in
the
chair
having
the
distinguished
guest
of
the
club
on
his
right
the
able
and
consistent
hicks
officiated
as
croupier
on
the
occasion
most
of
the
gentlemen
of
the
club
were
present
and
foker
and
spavin
friends
of
captain
costigan
were
also
participators
in
the
entertainment
the
cloth
having
been
drawn
the
chairman
said
costigan
there
is
wine
if
you
like
but
the
captain
preferring
punch
that
liquor
was
voted
by
acclamation
and
nobis
having
been
sung
in
admirable
style
by
bingley
hicks
and
bullby
of
the
cathedral
choir
than
whom
a
more
jovial
spirit
tossed
off
a
bumper
or
emptied
a
bowl
the
chairman
gave
the
health
of
the
which
was
drunk
with
the
loyalty
of
chatteris
men
and
then
without
further
circumlocution
proposed
their
friend
costigan
after
the
enthusiastic
cheering
which
rang
through
old
chatteris
had
subsided
captain
costigan
rose
in
reply
and
made
a
speech
of
twenty
minutes
in
which
he
was
repeatedly
overcome
by
his
emotions
the
gallant
captain
said
he
must
be
pardoned
for
incoherence
if
his
heart
was
too
full
to
speak
he
was
quitting
a
city
celebrated
for
its
antiquitee
its
hospitalitee
the
beautee
of
its
women
the
manly
fidelitee
generositee
and
jovialitee
of
its
men
cheers
he
was
going
from
that
ancient
and
venerable
city
of
which
while
mimoree
held
her
sayt
he
should
never
think
without
the
fondest
emotion
to
a
methrawpolis
where
the
talents
of
his
daughther
were
about
to
have
full
play
and
where
he
would
watch
over
her
like
a
guardian
angel
he
should
never
forget
that
it
was
at
chatteris
she
had
acquired
the
skill
which
she
was
about
to
exercise
in
another
sphere
and
in
her
name
and
his

and
blessed

of
feeling
and
eloquence
jubber
proposed
the
drama
and
the
chatteris
theatre
and
bingley
was
about
to
rise
but
was
prevented
by
captain
costigan
who
as
long
connected
with
the
chatteris
theatre
and
on
behalf
of
his
daughter
thanked
the
company
he
informed
them
that
he
had
been

at
gibraltar
and
at

been

the

out

who
sate
on

smelling

the

boy
which
tom
said
he
should
like
very
much
to
see
they
were
gone
and
pen
had
never
seen
them
he
only
knew
of
their
departure
by
its
announcement
in
the
county
paper
the
next
day
and
straight
galloped
over
to
chatteris
to
hear
the
truth
of
this
news
they
were
gone
indeed
a
card
of
to
let
was
placed
in
the
dear
little
familiar
window
he
rushed
up
into
the
room
and
viewed
it
over
he
sate
ever
so
long
in
the
old
looking
into
the
garden
whence
he
and
emily
had
so
often
looked
out
together
he
walked
with
a
sort
of
terror
into
her
little
empty
bedroom
it
was
swept
out
and
prepared
for
the
glass
which
had
reflected
her
fair
face
was
shining
ready
for
her
successor
the
curtains
lay
square
folded
on
the
little
bed
he
flung
himself
down
and
buried
his
head
on
the
vacant
pillow
laura
had
netted
a
purse
into
which
his
mother
had
put
some
sovereigns
and
pen
had
found
it
on
his
that
very
morning
he
gave
one
to
the
little
servant
who
had
been
used
to
wait
upon
the
costigans
and
another
to
the
children
because
they
said
they
were
very
fond
of
her
it
was
but
a
few
months
back
yet
what
years
ago
it
seemed
since
he
had
first
entered
that
room
he
felt
that
it
was
all
done
the
very
missing
her
at
the
coach
had
something
fatal
in
it
blank
weary
utterly
wretched
and
lonely
the
poor
lad
felt
his
mother
saw
she
was
gone
by
his
look
when
he
came
home
he
was
eager
to
fly
too
now
as
were
other
folks
round
about
chatteris
poor
smirke
wanted
to
go
away
from
the
sight
of
the
syren
widow
foker
began
to
think
he
had
had
enough
of
baymouth
and
that
a
few
at
saint
boniface
would
not
be
unpleasant
and
major
pendennis
longed
to
be
off
and
have
a
little
at
stillbrook
and
get
rid
of
all
annoyances
and
tracasseries
of
the
village
the
widow
and
laura
nervously
set
about
the
preparation
for
pen
kit
and
filled
trunks
with
his
books
and
linen
helen
wrote
cards
with
the
name
of
arthur
pendennis
which
were
duly
nailed
on
the
boxes
and
at
which
both
she
and
laura
looked
with
tearful
wistful
eyes
it
was
not
until
long
long
after
he
was
gone
that
pen
remembered
how
constant
and
tender
the
affection
of
these
women
had
been
and
how
selfish
his
own
conduct
was
a
night
soon
comes
when
the
mail
with
echoing
horn
and
blazing
lamps
stops
at
the
of
fairoaks
and
pen
trunks
and
his
are
placed
on
the
roof
of
the
carriage
into
which
the
pair
presently
afterwards
enter
helen
and
laura
are
standing
by
the
evergreens
of
the
shrubbery
their
figures
lighted
up
by
the
coach
lamps
the
guard
cries
all
right
in
another
instant
the
carriage
whirls
onward
the
lights
disappear
and
helen
heart
and
prayers
go
with
them
her
sainted
benedictions
follow
the
departing
boy
he
has
left
the
in
which
he
has
been
chafing
and
whither
after
his
very
first
flight
he
returned
bleeding
and
wounded
he
is
eager
to
go
forth
again
and
try
his
restless
wings
how
lonely
the
house
looks
without
him
the
corded
trunks
and
are
there
in
his
empty
study
laura
asks
leave
to
come
and
sleep
in
helen
room
and
when
she
has
cried
herself
to
sleep
there
the
mother
goes
softly
into
pen
vacant
chamber
and
kneels
down
by
the
bed
on
which
the
moon
is
shining
and
there
prays
for
her
boy
as
mothers
only
know
how
to
plead
he
knows
that
her
pure
blessings
are
following
him
as
he
is
carried

away

every
man
however
brief
or
inglorious
may
have
been
his
academical
career
must
remember
with
kindness
and
tenderness
the
old
university
comrades
and
days
the
young

life
is
just
beginning
the
are
cut

he
has
all
the

of

he
has
no
idea
of
cares
yet
or
of
bad
health
or
of

poverty
or
disappointment
the

has
not
been
acted
so
often
as
to
make
him
tired
though
the
after
drink
as
we
mechanically
go
on
repeating
it
is
stale
and
bitter
how
pure
and
brilliant
was
that
first
sparkling
draught
of
pleasure

the

rushes
at

with
what
a
wild
eagerness
he
drains
it

are
cut
off
from
the
delights
of

table
and
are
restricted
to
a
poached
egg
and
a
glass
of
water
like
to
see
people
with
good
appetites
and
as
the
next
best
thing
to
being
amused
at
a
pantomime
is
to
see
one
children
enjoy
it
i
hope
there
may
be
no
degree
of
age
or
experience
to
which
mortal
may
attain
when
he
shall
become
such
a
glum
philosopher
as
not
to
be
pleased
by
the
sight
of
happy
youth
coming
back
a
few
weeks
since
from
a
brief
visit
to
the
old
university
of
oxbridge
where
my
friend
arthur
pendennis
passed
some
period
of
his
life
i
made
the
journey
in
the
railroad
by
the
side
of
a
young
fellow
at
present
a
student
of
saint
boniface
he
had
got
an
exeat
somehow
and
was
bent
on
a
day
lark
in
london
he
never
stopped
rattling
and
talking
from
the
commencement
of
the
journey
until
its
close
which
was
a
great
deal
too
soon
for
me
for
i
never
was
tired
of
listening
to
the
honest
young
fellow
jokes
and
cheery
laughter
and
when
we
arrived
at
the
terminus
nothing
would
satisfy
him
but
a
hansom
cab
so
that
he
might
get
into
town
the
quicker
and
plunge
into
the
pleasures
awaiting
him
there
away
the
young
lad
went
whirling
with
joy
lighting
up
his
honest
face
and
as
for
the
reader
humble
servant
having
but
a
small
i
got
up
on
the
outside
of
the
omnibus
and
sate
there
very
contentedly
between
a
smoking
bad
cigars
and
a
gentleman
servant
taking
care
of
a
until
we
got
our
fated
complement
of
passengers
and
boxes
when
the
coachman
drove
leisurely
away
we
were
in
a
hurry
to
get
to
town
neither
one
of
us
was
particularly
eager
about
rushing
into
that
near
smoking
babylon
or
thought
of
dining
at
the
club
that
night
or
dancing
at
the
casino
yet
a
few
years
more
and
my
young
friend
of
the
railroad
will
be
not
a
whit
more
eager
there
were
no
railroads
made
when
arthur
pendennis
went
to
the
famous
university
of
oxbridge
but
he
drove
thither
in
a
coach
filled
inside
and
out
with
dons
gownsmen
young
freshmen
about
to
enter
and
their
guardians
who
were
conducting
them
to
the
university
a
fat
old
gentleman
in
grey
stockings
from
the
city
who
sate
by
major
pendennis
inside
the
coach
having
his
son
opposite
was
frightened
beyond
measure
when
he
heard
that
the
coach
had
been
driven
for
a
couple
of
stages
by
young
foker
of
saint
boniface
college
who
was
the
friend
of
all
men
including
coachmen
and
could
drive
as
well
as
tom
hicks
himself
pen
sate
on
the
roof
examining
coach
passengers
and
country
with
great
delight
and
curiosity
his
heart
jumped
with
pleasure
as
the
famous
university
came
in
view
and
the
magnificent
prospect
of
venerable
towers
and
pinnacles
tall
elms
and
shining
river
spread
before
him
pen
had
passed
a
few
days
with
his
uncle
at
the
major
lodgings
in
bury
street
before
they
set
out
for
oxbridge
major
pendennis
thought
that
the
lad
wardrobe
wanted
renewal
and
arthur
was
by
no
means
averse
to
any
plan
which
was
to
bring
him
new
coats
and
waistcoats
there
was
no
end
to
the
sacrifices
which
the
uncle
made
in
the
youth
behalf
london
was
awfully
lonely
the
pall
mall
pavement
was
deserted
the
very
red
jackets
had
gone
out
of
town
there
was
scarce
a
face
to
be
seen
in
the
of
the
clubs
the
major
conducted
his
nephew
into
one
or
two
of
those
desert
mansions
and
wrote
down
the
lad
name
on
the
of
one
of
them
and
pleasure
at
this
compliment
on
his
guardian
part
was
excessive
he
read
in
the
parchment
volume
his
name
and
titles
as
pendennis
esquire
of
fairoaks
lodge
shire
and
saint
boniface
college
oxbridge
proposed
by
major
pendennis
and
seconded
by
viscount
colchicum
with
a
thrill
of
intense
gratification
you
will
come
in
for
ballot
in
about
three
years
by
which
time
you
will
have
taken
your
degree
the
guardian
said
pen
longed
for
the
three
years
to
be
over
and
surveyed
the
and
vast
libraries
and
as
already
his
own
property
the
major
laughed
slyly
to
see
the
pompous
airs
of
the
simple
young
fellow
as
he
strutted
out
of
the
building
he
and
foker
drove
down
in
the
latter
cab
one
day
to
the
grey
friars
and
renewed
acquaintance
with
some
of
their
old
comrades
there
the
boys
came
crowding
up
to
the
cab
as
it
stood
by
the
grey
friars
gates
where
they
were
entering
and
admired
the
chestnut
horse
and
the
tights
and
livery
and
gravity
of
stoopid
the
tiger
the
bell
for
rang
as
they
were
swaggering
about
the
talking
to
their
old
cronies
the
awful
doctor
passed
into
school
with
his
grammar
in
his
hand
foker
slunk
away
uneasily
at
his
presence
but
pen
went
up
blushing
and
shook
the
dignitary
by
the
hand
he
laughed
as
he
thought
that
latin
grammar
had
boxed
his
ears
many
a
time
he
was
generous
and
in
a
word
perfectly
conceited
and
satisfied
with
himself
then
they
drove
to
the
parental
foker
entire
is
composed
in
an
enormous
pile
of
buildings
not
far
from
the
grey
friars
and
the
name
of
that
firm
is
gilded
upon
innumerable
signs
tenanted
by
its
vassals
in
the
neighbourhood
and
the
venerable
junior
partner
and
manager
did
honour
to
the
young
lord
of
the
vats
and
his
friend
and
served
them
with
silver
flagons
of
so
strong
that
you
would
have
thought
not
only
the
young
men
but
the
very
horse
harry
foker
drove
was
affected
by
the
potency
of
the
drink
for
he
rushed
home
to
the
of
the
town
at
a
rapid
pace
which
endangered
the
and
the
women
on
the
crossings
and
brought
the
into
collision
with
the
posts
at
the
street
corners
and
caused
stoopid
to
swing
fearfully
on
his
board
behind
the
major
was
quite
pleased
when
pen
was
with
his
young
acquaintance
listened
to
foker
artless
stories
with
the
greatest
interest
gave
the
two
boys
a
fine
dinner
at
a
covent
garden
whence
they
proceeded
to
the
play
but
was
above
all
happy
when
and
lady
agnes
foker
who
happened
to
be
in
london
requested
the
pleasure
of
major
pendennis
and
arthur
pendennis
company
at
dinner
in
grosvenor
street
having
obtained
the
entree
into
lady
agnes
foker
house
he
said
to
pen
with
an
affectionate
solemnity
which
befitted
the
importance
of
the
occasion
it
behoves
you
my
dear
boy
to
keep
it
you
must
mind
and
never
neglect
to
call
in
grosvenor
street
when
you
come
to
london
i
recommend
you
to
read
up
carefully
in
debrett
the
alliances
and
genealogy
of
the
earls
of
rosherville
and
if
you
can
to
make
some
trifling
allusions
to
the
family
something
historical
neat
and
complimentary
and
that
sort
of
thing
which
you
who
have
a
poetic
fancy
can
do
pretty
well
foker
himself
is
a
worthy
man
though
not
of
high
extraction
or
indeed
much
education
he
always
makes
a
point
of
having
some
of
the
family
porter
served
round
after
dinner
which
you
will
on
no
account
refuse
and
which
i
shall
drink
myself
though
all
beer
disagrees
with
me
and
the
heroic
martyr
did
actually
sacrifice
himself
as
he
said
he
would
on
the
day
when
the
dinner
took
place
and
old
foker
at
the
head
of
his
table
made
his
usual
joke
about
foker
entire
we
should
all
of
us
i
am
sure
have
liked
to
see
the
major
grin
when
the
worthy
old
gentleman
made
his
joke
lady
agnes
who
wrapped
up
in
harry
was
the
fondest
of
mothers
and
one
of
the
most
though
not
the
wisest
of
women
received
her
son
friend
with
great
cordiality
and
astonished
pen
by
accounts
of
the
severe
course
of
studies
which
her
darling
boy
was
pursuing
and
which
she
feared
might
injure
his
dear
health
foker
the
elder
burst
into
a
at
some
of
these
speeches
and
the
heir
of
the
house
winked
his
eye
very
knowingly
at
his
friend
and
lady
agnes
then
going
through
her
son
history
from
the
earliest
time
and
recounting
his
miraculous
sufferings
in
the
measles
and
his
escape
from
drowning
the
shocking
tyrannies
practised
upon
him
at
that
horrid
school
whither
foker
would
send
him
because
he
had
been
brought
up
there
himself
and
she
never
would
forgive
that
disagreeable
doctor
no
never
lady
agnes
we
say
having
prattled
away
for
an
hour
incessantly
about
her
son
voted
the
two
messieurs
pendennis
most
agreeable
men
and
when
pheasants
came
with
the
second
course
which
the
major
praised
as
the
very
finest
birds
he
ever
saw
her
ladyship
said
they
came
from
logwood
as
the
major
knew
perfectly
well
and
hoped
that
they
would
both
pay
her
a
visit
there
at
christmas
or
when
dear
harry
was
at
home
for
the
vacations
god
bless
you
my
dear
boy
pendennis
said
to
arthur
as
they
were
lighting
their
candles
in
bury
street
afterwards
to
go
to
bed
you
made
that
little
allusion
to
agincourt
where
one
of
the
roshervilles
distinguished
himself
very
neatly
and
well
although
lady
agnes
did
not
quite
understand
it
but
it
was
exceedingly
well
for
a
beginner
though
you
ought
to
blush
so
by
the
way
and
i
beseech
you
my
dear
arthur
to
remember
through
life
that
with
an
entree
with
a
good
entree
mind
it
is
just
as
easy
for
you
to
have
good
society
as
bad
and
that
it
costs
a
man
when
properly
introduced
no
more
trouble
or
soins
to
keep
a
good
footing
in
the
best
houses
in
london
than
to
dine
with
a
lawyer
in
bedford
square
mind
this
when
you
are
at
oxbridge
pursuing
your
studies
and
for
heaven
sake
be
very
particular
in
the
acquaintances
which
you
make
the
premier
pas
in
life
is
the
most
important
of
all
did
you
write
to
your
mother
no
well
do
before
you
go
and
call
and
ask
foker
for
a
frank
they
like
it
good
night
god
bless
pen
wrote
a
droll
account
of
his
doings
in
london
and
the
play
and
the
visit
to
the
old
friars
and
the
brewery
and
the
party
at
foker
to
his
dearest
mother
who
was
saying
her
prayers
at
home
in
the
lonely
house
at
fairoaks
her
heart
full
of
love
and
tenderness
unutterable
for
the
boy
and
she
and
laura
read
that
letter
and
those
which
followed
many
many
times
and
brooded
over
them
as
women
do
it
was
the
first
step
in
life
that
pen
was
making
ah
what
a
dangerous
journey
it
is
and
how
the
bravest

previous
communications
had
taken
place
between

on
pen
part
and
buck
tutor
of
boniface
on
whose
side
pen
was
entered
and
as
soon
as
major
pendennis
had
arranged
his
personal
appearance
so
that
it
should
make
a
satisfactory
impression
upon

tutor
the
pair
walked
down
main
street
and
passed
the
great
gate
and
of
saint
college
and
so
came
as
they
were
directed
to
saint

again
pen
heart
began
to
beat
as
they
entered
at
the
wicket
of
the
venerable
gate

is
surmounted
with
an
ancient
dome
almost
covered
with

adorned
with

of

the

takes
its

the
porter
pointed
out
a
queer
old
tower
at
the
corner
of
the
quadrangle
by
which
buck
rooms
were
approached
and
the
two
gentlemen
walked
across
the
square
the
main
features
of
which
were
at
once
and
for
ever
stamped
in
pen
mind
the

all
these
mr

drank
in
with
an
eagerness
which
belongs
to

surveyed
with
that
calmness
which
belongs
to
a
gentleman
who
does
not

found
his

leaning
on
his

and
they
speedily
reached
buck
rooms
and
were
conducted
into
the
apartment
of
that
courteous
gentleman
he
had
received
previous
information
from
portman
regarding
pen
with
respect
to
whose
family
fortune
and
personal
merits
the
honest
doctor
had
spoken
with
no
small
enthusiasm
indeed
portman
had
described
arthur
to
the
tutor
as
a
young
gentleman
of
some
fortune
and
landed
estate
of
one
of
the
most
ancient
families
in
the
kingdom
and
possessing
such
a
character
and
genius
as
were
sure
under
the
proper
guidance
to
make
him
a
credit
to
the
college
and
the
under
such
recommendations
the
tutor
was
of
course
most
cordial
to
the
young
freshman
and
his
guardian
invited
the
latter
to
dine
in
hall
where
he
would
have
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
his
nephew
wear
his
gown
and
eat
his
dinner
for
the
first
time
and
requested
the
pair
to
take
wine
at
his
rooms
after
hall
and
in
consequence
of
the
highly
favourable
report
he
had
received
of
arthur
pendennis
said
he
should
be
happy
to
give
him
the
best
set
of
rooms
to
be
had
in
college
a
set
indeed
which
were
just
luckily
vacant
so
they
parted
until
which
was
very
near
at
hand
and
major
pendennis
pronounced
buck
to
be
uncommonly
civil
indeed
indeed
when
a
college
magnate
takes
the
trouble
to
be
polite
there
is
no
man
more
splendidly
courteous
immersed
in
their
books
and
excluded
from
the
world
by
the
gravity
of
their
occupations
these
reverend
men
assume
a
solemn
magnificence
of
compliment
in
which
they
rustle
and
swell
as
in
their
grand
robes
of
state
those
silks
and
brocades
are
not
put
on
for
all
comers
or
every
day
when
the
two
gentlemen
had
taken
leave
of
the
tutor
in
his
study
and
had
returned
to
buck
or
a
very
handsome
apartment
and
hung
with
excellent
prints
and
richly
framed
pictures
they
found
the
tutor
servant
already
in
waiting
there
accompanied
by
a
man
with
a
bag
full
of
caps
and
a
number
of
gowns
from
which
pen
might
select
a
cap
and
gown
for
himself
and
the
servant
no
doubt
would
get
a
commission
proportionable
to
the
service
done
by
him
mr
pen
was
all
in
a
tremor
of
pleasure
as
the
bustling
tailor
tried
on
a
gown
and
pronounced
that
it
was
an
excellent
fit
and
then
he
put
the
pretty
college
cap
on
in
rather
a
dandified
manner
and
somewhat
on
one
side
as
he
had
seen
fiddicombe
the
youngest
master
at
grey
friars
wear
it
and
he
inspected
the
entire
costume
with
a
great
deal
of
satisfaction
in
one
of
the
great
gilt
mirrors
which
ornamented
buck
for
some
of
these
college
divines
are
no
more
above
than
a
lady
is
and
look
to
the
set
of
their
gowns
and
caps
quite
as
anxiously
as
folks
do
of
the
lovelier
sex
the
major
smiled
as
he
saw
the
boy
dandifying
himself
in
the
glass
the
old
gentleman
was
not
displeased
with
the
appearance
of
the
comely
lad
then
davis
the
skip
or
attendant
led
the
way
keys
in
hand
across
the
quadrangle
the
major
and
pen
following
him
the
latter
blushing
and
pleased
with
his
new
academical
habiliments
across
the
quadrangle
to
the
rooms
which
were
destined
for
the
freshman
and
which
were
vacated
by
the
retreat
of
the
spicer
the
rooms
were
very
comfortable
with
large
cross
beams
high
wainscots
and
small
windows
in
deep
embrasures
spicer
furniture
was
there
and
to
be
sold
at
a
valuation
and
major
pendennis
agreed
on
his
nephew
behalf
to
take
the
available
part
of
it
laughingly
however
declining
as
indeed
pen
did
for
his
own
part
six
sporting
prints
and
four
groups
of
with
gauze
draperies
which
formed
the
late
pictorial
collection
then
they
went
to
hall
where
pen
sate
down
and
ate
his
commons
with
his
brother
freshmen
and
the
major
took
his
place
at
the
along
with
the
college
dignitaries
and
other
fathers
or
guardians
of
youth
who
had
come
up
with
their
sons
to
oxbridge
and
after
hall
they
went
to
buck
to
take
wine
and
after
wine
to
chapel
where
the
major
sate
with
great
gravity
in
the
upper
place
having
a
fine
view
of
the
master
in
his
carved
throne
or
stall
under
the
where
that
gentleman
the
learned
doctor
donne
sate
magnificent
with
his
great
before
him
an
image
of
statuesque
piety
and
rigid
devotion
all
the
young
freshmen
behaved
with
gravity
and
decorum
but
pen
was
shocked
to
see
that
atrocious
little
foker
who
came
in
very
late
and
half
a
dozen
of
his
comrades
in
the
seats
giggling
and
talking
as
if
they
had
been
in
so
many
stalls
at
the
opera
but
these
circumstances
it
must
be
remembered
took
place
some
years
back
when
william
the
fourth
was
king
young
men
are
much
better
behaved
now
and
besides
saint
boniface
was
rather
a
fast
college
pen
could
hardly
sleep
at
night
in
his
bedroom
at
the
trencher
so
anxious
was
he
to
begin
his
college
life
and
to
get
into
his
own
apartments
what
did
he
think
about
as
he
lay
tossing
and
awake
was
it
about
his
mother
at
home
the
pious
soul
whose
life
was
bound
up
in
his
yes
let
us
hope
he
thought
of
her
a
little
was
it
about
miss
fotheringay
and
his
eternal
passion
which
had
kept
him
awake
so
many
nights
and
created
such
wretchedness
and
such
longing
he
had
a
trick
of
blushing
and
if
you
had
been
in
the
room
and
the
candle
had
not
been
out
you
might
have
seen
the
youth
countenance
redden
more
than
once
as
he
broke
out
into
passionate
incoherent
exclamations
regarding
that
luckless
event
of
his
life
his
uncle
lessons
had
not
been
thrown
away
upon
him
the
mist
of
passion
had
passed
from
his
eyes
now
and
he
saw
her
as
she
was
to
think
that
he
pendennis
had
been
enslaved
by
such
a
woman
and
then
jilted
by
her
that
he
should
have
stooped
so
low
to
be
trampled
on
the
mire
that
there
was
a
time
in
his
life
and
that
but
a
few
months
back
when
he
was
willing
to
take
costigan
for
his
poor
old
smirke
pen
presently
laughed
out
well
i
write
and
try
and
console
the
poor
old
boy
he
wo
die
of
his
passion
ha
ha
the
major
had
he
been
awake
might
have
heard
a
score
of
such
ejaculations
uttered
by
pen
as
he
lay
awake
and
restless
through
the
first
night
of
his
residence
at
oxbridge
it
would
perhaps
have
been
better
for
a
youth
the
battle
of
whose
life
was
going
to
begin
on
the
morrow
to
have
passed
the
eve
in
a
different
sort
of
vigil
but
the
world
had
got
hold
of
pen
in
the
shape
of
his
selfish
old
mentor
and
those
who
have
any
interest
in
his
character
must
have
perceived
ere
now
that
this
lad
was
very
weak
as
well
as
very
impetuous
very
vain
as
well
as
very
frank
and
if
of
a
generous
disposition
not
a
little
selfish
in
the
midst
of
his
profuseness
and
also
rather
fickle
as
all
eager
pursuers
of
are
the
six
months
passion
had
aged
him
very
considerably
there
was
an
immense
gulf
between
pen
the
victim
of
love
and
pen
the
innocent
boy
of
eighteen
sighing
after
it
and
so
arthur
pendennis
had
all
the
experience
and
superiority
besides
that
command
which
afterwards
conceit
and
imperiousness
of
disposition
gave
him
over
the
young
men
with
whom
he
now
began
to
live
he
and
his
uncle
passed
the
morning
with
great
satisfaction
in
making
purchases
for
the
better
comfort
of
the
apartments
which
the
lad
was
about
to
occupy
spicer
china
and
glass
was
in
a
dreadfully
dismantled
condition
his
lamps
smashed
and
his
bookcases
by
no
means
so
spacious
as
those
shelves
which
would
be
requisite
to
receive
the
contents
of
the
boxes
which
were
lying
in
the
hall
at
fairoaks
and
which
were
addressed
to
arthur
in
the
hand
of
poor
helen
the
boxes
arrived
in
a
few
days
that
his
mother
had
packed
with
so
much
care
pen
was
touched
as
he
read
the
superscriptions
in
the
dear
hand
and
he
arranged
in
their
proper
places
all
the
books
his
old
friends
and
all
the
linen
and
which
helen
had
selected
from
the
family
stock
and
all
the
which
little
laura
had
bound
in
straw
and
the
hundred
simple
gifts
of
home
pen
had
another
alma
mater
now
but
it
is
not
all
children
who
take
to
her
kindly
chapter
xix
pendennis
of
boniface
our
friend
pen
was
not
sorry
when
his
mentor
took
leave
of
the
young
gentleman
on
the
second
day
after
the
arrival
of
the
pair
in
oxbridge
and
we
may
be
sure
that
the
major
on
his
part
was
very
glad
to
have
discharged
his
duty
and
to
have
the
duty
over
more
than
three
months
of
precious
time
had
that
martyr
of
a
major
given
up
to
his
nephew
was
ever
selfish
man
called
upon
to
make
a
greater
sacrifice
do
you
know
many
men
or
majors
who
would
do
as
much
a
man
will
lay
down
his
head
or
peril
his
life
for
his
honour
but
let
us
be
shy
how
we
ask
him
to
give
up
his
ease
or
his
heart
desire
very
few
of
us
can
bear
that
trial
say
worthy
reader
if
thou
hast
peradventure
a
beard
wouldst
thou
do
as
much
i
will
not
say
that
a
woman
will
not
they
are
used
to
it
we
take
care
to
accustom
them
to
sacrifices
but
my
good
sir
the
amount
of
which
you
have
probably
exerted
through
life
when
put
down
to
your
account
elsewhere
will
not
probably
swell
the
balance
on
the
credit
side
much
well
well
there
is
no
use
in
speaking
of
such
ugly
matters
and
you
are
too
polite
to
use
a
vulgar
to
quoque
but
i
wish
to
state
once
for
all
that
i
greatly
admire
the
major
for
his
conduct
during
the
past
quarter
and
think
that
he
has
quite
a
right
to
be
pleased
at
getting
a
holiday
foker
and
pen
saw
him
off
in
the
coach
and
the
former
young
gentleman
gave
particular
orders
to
the
coachman
to
take
care
of
that
gentleman
inside
it
pleased
the
elder
pendennis
to
have
his
nephew
in
the
company
of
a
young
fellow
who
would
introduce
him
to
the
best
set
of
the
university
the
major
rushed
off
to
london
and
thence
to
cheltenham
from
which
he
descended
upon
some
neighbouring
great
houses
whereof
the
families
were
not
gone
abroad
and
where
good
shooting
and
company
was
to
be
had
a
quarter
of
the
space
which
custom
has
awarded
to
works
styled
the
serial
nature
has
been
assigned
to
the
account
of
one
passage
in
career
and
it
is
manifest
that
the
whole
of
his
adventures
can
not
be
treated
at
a
similar
length
unless
some
descendant
of
the
chronicler
of
pen
history
should
take
up
the
pen
at
his
decease
and
continue
the
narrative
for
the
successors
of
the
present
generation
of
readers
we
are
not
about
to
go
through
the
young
fellow
academical
career
with
by
any
means
a
similar
minuteness
alas
the
life
of
such
boys
does
not
bear
telling
altogether
i
wish
it
did
i
ask
you
does
yours
as
long
as
what
we
call
our
honour
is
clear
i
suppose
your
mind
is
pretty
easy
women
are
pure
but
not
men
women
are
unselfish
but
not
men
and
i
would
not
wish
to
say
of
poor
arthur
pendennis
that
he
was
worse
than
his
neighbours
only
that
his
neighbours
are
bad
for
the
most
part
let
us
have
the
candour
to
own
as
much
at
least
can
you
point
out
ten
spotless
men
of
your
acquaintance
mine
is
pretty
large
but
i
find
ten
saints
in
the
list
during
the
first
term
of
mr
pen
academical
life
he
attended
classical
and
mathematical
lectures
with
tolerable
assiduity
but
discovering
before
very
long
time
that
he
had
little
taste
or
genius
for
the
pursuing
of
the
exact
sciences
and
being
perhaps
rather
annoyed
that
one
or
two
very
vulgar
young
men
who
did
not
even
use
straps
to
their
trousers
so
as
to
cover
the
abominably
thick
and
coarse
shoes
and
stockings
which
they
wore
beat
him
completely
in
the
he
gave
up
his
attendance
at
that
course
and
announced
to
his
fond
parent
that
he
proposed
to
devote
himself
exclusively
to
the
cultivation
of
greek
and
roman
literature
pendennis
was
for
her
part
quite
satisfied
that
her
darling
boy
should
pursue
that
branch
of
learning
for
which
he
had
the
greatest
inclination
and
only
besought
him
not
to
ruin
his
health
by
too
much
study
for
she
had
heard
the
most
melancholy
stories
of
young
students
who
by
had
brought
on
and
perished
untimely
in
the
midst
of
their
university
career
and
pen
health
which
was
always
delicate
was
to
be
regarded
as
she
justly
said
beyond
all
considerations
or
vain
honours
pen
although
not
aware
of
any
lurking
disease
which
was
likely
to
end
his
life
yet
kindly
promised
his
mamma
not
to
sit
up
reading
too
late
of
nights
and
stuck
to
his
word
in
this
respect
with
a
great
deal
more
tenacity
of
resolution
than
he
exhibited
upon
some
other
occasions
when
perhaps
he
was
a
little
remiss
presently
he
began
too
to
find
that
he
learned
little
good
in
the
classical
lecture
his
there
were
too
dull
as
in
mathematics
they
were
too
learned
for
him
buck
the
tutor
was
no
better
a
scholar
than
many
a
boy
at
grey
friars
might
have
some
stupid
humdrum
notions
about
the
metre
and
grammatical
construction
of
a
passage
of
aeschylus
or
aristophanes
but
had
no
more
notion
of
the
poetry
than
mrs
binge
his
and
pen
grew
weary
of
hearing
the
dull
students
and
tutor
blunder
through
a
few
lines
of
a
play
which
he
could
read
in
a
tenth
part
of
the
time
which
they
gave
to
it
after
all
private
reading
as
he
began
to
perceive
was
the
only
study
which
was
really
profitable
to
a
man
and
he
announced
to
his
mamma
that
he
should
read
by
himself
a
great
deal
more
and
in
public
a
great
deal
less
that
excellent
woman
knew
no
more
about
homer
than
she
did
about
algebra
but
she
was
quite
contented
with
pen
arrangements
regarding
his
course
of
studies
and
felt
perfectly
confident
that
her
dear
boy
would
get
the
place
which
he
merited
pen
did
not
come
home
until
after
christmas
a
little
to
the
fond
mother
disappointment
and
laura
who
was
longing
for
him
to
make
a
fine
snow
fortification
such
as
he
had
made
three
winters
before
but
he
was
invited
to
logwood
lady
agnes
foker
where
there
were
private
theatricals
and
a
gay
christmas
party
of
very
fine
folks
some
of
them
whom
major
pendennis
would
on
no
account
have
his
nephew
neglect
however
he
stayed
at
home
for
the
last
three
weeks
of
the
vacation
and
laura
had
the
opportunity
of
remarking
what
a
quantity
of
fine
new
clothes
he
brought
with
him
and
his
mother
admired
his
improved
appearance
and
manly
and
decided
tone
he
did
not
come
home
at
easter
but
when
he
arrived
for
the
long
vacation
he
brought
more
smart
clothes
appearing
in
the
morning
in
wonderful
shooting
jackets
with
remarkable
buttons
and
in
the
evening
in
gorgeous
velvet
waistcoats
with
cravats
and
curious
linen
and
as
she
pried
about
his
room
she
saw
oh
such
a
beautiful
with
silver
mountings
and
a
quantity
of
lovely
rings
and
jewellery
and
he
had
a
new
french
watch
and
gold
chain
in
place
of
the
big
old
chronometer
with
its
bunch
of
jingling
seals
which
had
hung
from
the
fob
of
john
pendennis
and
by
the
of
which
the
defunct
doctor
had
felt
many
a
patient
pulse
in
his
time
it
was
but
a
few
months
back
pen
had
longed
for
this
watch
which
he
thought
the
most
splendid
and
august
timepiece
in
the
world
and
just
before
he
went
to
college
helen
had
taken
it
out
of
her
where
it
had
remained
unwound
since
the
death
of
her
husband
and
given
it
to
pen
with
a
solemn
and
appropriate
little
speech
respecting
his
father
virtues
and
the
proper
use
of
time
this
portly
and
valuable
chronometer
pen
now
pronounced
to
be
out
of
date
and
indeed
made
some
comparisons
between
it
and
a
which
laura
thought
disrespectful
and
he
left
the
watch
in
a
drawer
in
the
company
of
soiled
primrose
gloves
cravats
which
had
gone
out
of
favour
and
of
that
other
school
watch
which
has
once
before
been
mentioned
in
this
history
our
old
friend
rebecca
pen
pronounced
to
be
no
long
up
to
his
weight
and
swapped
her
away
for
another
and
more
powerful
horse
for
which
he
had
to
pay
rather
a
heavy
figure
pendennis
gave
the
boy
the
money
for
the
new
horse
and
laura
cried
when
rebecca
was
fetched
away
also
pen
brought
a
large
box
of
cigars
branded
colorados
afrancesados
telescopios
fudson
oxford
street
or
by
some
such
strange
titles
and
began
to
consume
these
not
only
about
the
stables
and
where
they
were
very
good
for
helen
plants
but
in
his
own
study
of
which
practice
his
mother
did
not
at
first
approve
but
he
was
at
work
upon
a
he
said
and
could
not
compose
without
his
cigar
and
quoted
the
late
lamented
it
lord
byron
lines
in
favour
of
the
custom
of
smoking
as
he
was
smoking
to
such
good
purpose
his
mother
could
not
of
course
refuse
permission
in
fact
the
good
soul
coming
into
the
room
one
day
in
the
midst
of
pen
labours
he
was
consulting
a
novel
which
had
recently
appeared
for
the
cultivation
of
the
light
literature
of
his
own
country
as
well
as
of
foreign
nations
became
every
student
helen
we
say
coming
into
the
room
and
finding
pen
on
the
sofa
at
this
work
rather
than
disturb
him
went
for
a
and
his
to
his
bedroom
which
was
adjacent
and
actually
put
the
cigar
into
his
mouth
and
lighted
the
match
at
which
he
kindled
it
pen
laughed
and
kissed
his
mother
hand
as
it
hung
fondly
over
the
back
of
the
sofa
dear
old
mother
he
said
if
i
were
to
tell
you
to
burn
the
house
down
i
think
you
would
do
and
it
is
very
likely
that
mr
pen
was
right
and
that
the
foolish
woman
would
have
done
almost
as
much
for
him
as
he
said
besides
the
works
of
english
light
literature
which
this
diligent
student
devoured
he
brought
down
boxes
of
the
light
literature
of
the
neighbouring
country
of
france
into
the
leaves
of
which
when
helen
dipped
she
read
such
things
as
caused
her
to
open
her
eyes
with
wonder
but
pen
showed
her
that
it
was
not
he
who
made
the
books
though
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
he
should
keep
up
his
french
by
an
acquaintance
with
the
most
celebrated
writers
of
the
day
and
that
it
was
as
clearly
his
duty
to
read
the
eminent
paul
de
kock
as
to
study
swift
or
moliere
and
pendennis
yielded
with
a
sigh
of
perplexity
but
miss
laura
was
warned
off
the
books
both
by
his
anxious
mother
and
that
rigid
moralist
arthur
pendennis
himself
who
however
he
might
be
called
upon
to
study
every
branch
of
literature
in
order
to
form
his
mind
and
to
perfect
his
style
would
by
no
means
prescribe
such
a
course
of
reading
to
a
young
lady
whose
business
in
life
was
very
different
in
the
course
of
this
long
vacation
mr
pen
drank
up
the
bin
of
claret
which
his
father
had
laid
in
and
of
which
we
have
heard
the
son
remark
that
there
was
not
a
headache
in
a
hogshead
and
this
wine
being
exhausted
he
wrote
for
a
further
supply
to
his
wine
merchants
binney
and
latham
of
mark
lane
london
from
whom
indeed
old
doctor
portman
had
recommended
pen
to
get
a
supply
of
port
and
sherry
on
going
to
college
you
will
have
no
doubt
to
entertain
your
young
friends
at
boniface
with
the
honest
rector
had
remarked
to
the
lad
they
used
to
be
customary
at
college
in
my
time
and
i
would
advise
you
to
employ
an
honest
and
respectable
house
in
london
for
your
small
stock
of
wine
rather
than
to
have
recourse
to
the
oxbridge
tradesmen
whose
liquor
if
i
remember
rightly
was
both
deleterious
in
quality
and
exorbitant
in
and
the
obedient
young
gentleman
took
the
doctor
advice
and
patronised
binney
and
latham
at
the
rector
suggestion
so
when
he
wrote
orders
for
a
stock
of
wine
to
be
sent
down
to
the
cellars
at
fairoaks
he
hinted
that
and
might
send
in
his
university
account
for
wine
at
the
same
time
with
the
fairoaks
bill
the
poor
widow
was
frightened
at
the
amount
but
pen
laughed
at
her
views
said
that
the
bill
was
moderate
that
everybody
drank
claret
and
champagne
now
and
finally
the
widow
paid
feeling
dimly
that
the
expenses
of
her
household
were
increasing
considerably
and
that
her
narrow
income
would
scarce
suffice
to
meet
them
but
they
were
only
occasional
pen
merely
came
home
for
a
few
weeks
at
the
vacation
laura
and
she
might
pinch
when
he
was
gone
in
the
brief
time
he
was
with
them
ought
they
not
to
make
him
happy
arthur
own
allowances
were
liberal
all
this
time
indeed
much
more
so
than
those
of
the
sons
of
far
more
wealthy
men
years
before
the
thrifty
and
affectionate
john
pendennis
whose
darling
project
it
had
ever
been
to
give
his
son
a
university
education
and
those
advantages
of
which
his
own
father
extravagance
had
deprived
him
had
begun
laying
by
a
store
of
money
which
he
called
arthur
education
fund
year
after
year
in
his
book
his
executors
found
entries
of
sums
vested
as
and
during
the
period
subsequent
to
her
husband
decease
and
before
pen
entry
at
college
the
widow
had
added
sundry
sums
to
this
fund
so
that
when
arthur
went
up
to
oxbridge
it
reached
no
inconsiderable
amount
let
him
be
liberally
allowanced
was
major
pendennis
maxim
let
him
make
his
first
entree
into
the
world
as
a
gentleman
and
take
his
place
with
men
of
good
rank
and
station
after
giving
it
to
him
it
will
be
his
own
duty
to
hold
it
there
is
no
such
bad
policy
as
stinting
a
boy
or
putting
him
on
a
lower
allowance
than
his
fellows
arthur
will
have
to
face
the
world
and
fight
for
himself
presently
meanwhile
we
shall
have
procured
for
him
good
friends
gentlemanly
habits
and
have
him
well
backed
and
well
trained
against
the
time
when
the
real
struggle
comes
and
these
liberal
opinions
the
major
probably
advanced
both
because
they
were
just
and
because
he
was
not
dealing
with
his
own
money
thus
young
pen
the
only
son
of
an
estated
country
gentleman
with
a
good
allowance
and
a
gentlemanlike
bearing
and
person
looked
to
be
a
lad
of
much
more
consequence
than
he
was
really
and
was
held
by
the
oxbridge
authorities
tradesmen
and
undergraduates
as
quite
a
young
buck
and
member
of
the
aristocracy
his
manner
was
frank
brave
and
perhaps
a
little
impertinent
as
becomes
a
youth
he
was
perfectly
generous
and
with
his
money
which
seemed
pretty
plentiful
he
loved
joviality
and
had
a
good
voice
for
a
song
had
not
risen
in
pen
time
to
the
fureur
which
as
we
are
given
to
understand
it
has
since
attained
in
the
university
and
riding
and
were
the
fashions
of
the
ingenuous
youth
pen
rode
well
to
hounds
appeared
in
pink
as
became
a
young
buck
and
not
particularly
extravagant
in
equestrian
or
any
other
amusement
yet
managed
to
run
up
a
fine
bill
at
nile
the
keeper
and
in
a
number
of
other
quarters
in
fact
this
lucky
young
gentleman
had
almost
every
taste
to
a
considerable
degree
he
was
very
fond
of
books
of
all
sorts
doctor
portman
had
taught
him
to
like
rare
editions
and
his
own
taste
led
him
to
like
beautiful
bindings
it
was
marvellous
what
tall
copies
and
gilding
and
marbling
and
the
booksellers
and
binders
put
upon
pen
bookshelves
he
had
a
very
fair
taste
in
matters
of
art
and
a
keen
relish
for
prints
of
a
high
school
none
of
your
french
opera
dancers
or
tawdry
racing
prints
such
as
had
delighted
the
simple
eyes
of
spicer
his
predecessor
but
your
stranges
and
rembrandt
etchings
and
wilkies
before
the
letter
with
which
his
apartments
were
furnished
presently
in
the
most
perfect
good
taste
as
was
allowed
in
the
university
where
this
young
fellow
got
no
small
reputation
we
have
mentioned
that
he
exhibited
a
certain
partiality
for
rings
jewellery
and
fine
raiment
of
all
sorts
and
it
must
be
owned
that
mr
pen
during
his
time
at
the
university
was
rather
a
dressy
man
and
loved
to
array
himself
in
splendour
he
and
his
polite
friends
would
dress
themselves
out
with
as
much
care
in
order
to
go
and
dine
at
each
other
rooms
as
other
folks
would
who
were
going
to
enslave
a
mistress
they
said
he
used
to
wear
rings
over
his
kid
gloves
which
he
always
denies
but
what
follies
will
not
youth
perpetrate
with
its
own
admirable
gravity
and
simplicity
that
he
took
perfumed
baths
is
a
truth
and
he
used
to
say
that
he
took
them
after
meeting
certain
men
of
a
very
low
set
in
hall
in
pen
second
year
when
miss
fotheringay
made
her
chief
hit
in
london
and
scores
of
prints
were
published
of
her
pen
had
one
of
these
hung
in
his
bedroom
and
confided
to
the
men
of
his
set
how
awfully
how
wildly
how
madly
how
passionately
he
had
loved
that
woman
he
showed
them
in
confidence
the
verses
that
he
had
written
to
her
and
his
brow
would
darken
his
eyes
roll
his
chest
heave
with
emotion
as
he
recalled
that
fatal
period
of
his
life
and
described
the
woes
and
agonies
which
he
had
suffered
the
verses
were
copied
out
handed
about
sneered
at
admired
passed
from
coterie
to
coterie
there
are
few
things
which
elevate
a
lad
in
the
estimation
of
his
brother
boys
more
than
to
have
a
character
for
a
great
and
romantic
passion
perhaps
there
is
something
noble
in
it
at
all
times
among
very
young
men
it
is
considered
heroic
pen
was
pronounced
a
tremendous
fellow
they
said
he
had
almost
committed
suicide
that
he
had
fought
a
duel
with
a
baronet
about
her
freshmen
pointed
him
out
to
each
other
as
at
the
promenade
time
at
two
he
swaggered
out
of
college
surrounded
by
his
cronies
he
was
famous
to
behold
he
was
elaborately
attired
he
would
ogle
the
ladies
who
came
to
lionise
the
university
and
passed
before
him
on
the
arms
of
happy
gownsmen
and
give
his
opinion
upon
their
personal
charms
or
their
toilettes
with
the
gravity
of
a
critic
whose
experience
entitled
him
to
speak
with
authority
men
used
to
say
that
they
had
been
walking
with
pendennis
and
were
as
pleased
to
be
seen
in
his
company
as
some
of
us
would
be
if
we
walked
with
a
duke
down
pall
mall
he
and
the
proctor
capped
each
other
as
they
met
as
if
they
were
rival
powers
and
the
men
hardly
knew
which
was
the
greater
in
fact
in
the
course
of
his
second
year
arthur
pendennis
had
become
one
of
the
men
of
fashion
in
the
university
it
is
curious
to
watch
that
facile
admiration
and
simple
fidelity
of
youth
they
hang
round
a
leader
and
wonder
at
him
and
love
him
and
imitate
him
no
generous
boy
ever
lived
i
suppose
that
has
not
had
some
wonderment
of
admiration
for
another
boy
and
monsieur
pen
at
oxbridge
had
his
school
his
faithful
band
of
friends
and
his
rivals
when
the
young
men
heard
at
the
haberdashers
shops
that
pendennis
of
boniface
had
just
ordered
a
crimson
you
would
see
a
couple
of
dozen
crimson
satin
cravats
in
main
street
in
the
course
of
the
week
and
simon
the
jeweller
was
known
to
sell
no
less
than
two
gross
of
pendennis
pins
from
a
pattern
which
the
young
gentleman
had
selected
in
his
shop
now
if
any
person
with
an
arithmetical
turn
of
mind
will
take
the
trouble
to
calculate
what
a
sum
of
money
it
would
cost
a
young
man
to
indulge
freely
in
all
the
above
propensities
which
we
have
said
mr
pen
possessed
it
will
be
seen
that
a
young
fellow
with
such
liberal
tastes
and
amusements
must
needs
in
the
course
of
two
or
three
years
spend
or
owe
a
very
handsome
sum
of
money
we
have
said
our
friend
pen
had
not
a
calculating
turn
no
one
propensity
of
his
was
outrageously
extravagant
and
it
is
certain
that
paddington
tailor
account
cook

for

with
finn
the
print
seller
for

landseer
proofs
and
wormall
dealings
with
parkton
the
great
bookseller
for
aldine
editions
folios
and
richly
illuminated
missals
of
the
xvi
century
and
snaffle
or
foker
score
with
nile
the
horsedealer
were
each
and
all
of
them
incomparably
greater
than
any
little
bills
which
mr
pen
might
run
up
with
the
tradesmen
but
pendennis
of
boniface
had
the
advantage
over
all
these
young
gentlemen
his
friends
and
associates
of
a
universality
of
taste
and
whereas
young
lord
paddington
did
not
care
twopence
for
the
most
beautiful
print
or
to
look
into
any
gilt
frame
that
had
not
a
mirror
within
it
and
guttlebury
did
not
mind
in
the
least
how
he
was
dressed
and
had
an
aversion
for
horse
exercise
nay
a
terror
of
it
and
snaffle
never
read
any
printed
works
but
the
calendar
or
life
or
cared
for
any
manuscript
except
his
greasy
little
scrawl
of
a
our
young
friend
occupied
himself
in
every
one
of
the
branches
of
science
or
pleasure
and
distinguished
himself
tolerably
in
each
hence
young
pen
got
a
prodigious
reputation
in
the
university
and
was
hailed
as
a
sort
of
crichton
and
as
for
the
english
verse
prize
in
competition
for
which
we
have
seen
him
busily
engaged
at
fairoaks
jones
of
jesus
carried
it
that
year
certainly
but
the
undergraduates
thought
pen
a
much
finer
poem
and
he
had
his
verses
printed
at
his
own
expense
and
distributed
in
gilt
morocco
covers
amongst
his
acquaintance
i
found
a
copy
of
it
lately
in
a
dusty
corner
of
mr
bookcases
and
have
it
before
me
this
minute
bound
up

the

how
strange
the

look
in
those

what
a
thrill
the
sight
of
the

gives
one
after
the
lapse
of
a
few

how
fate
since
that
time
has
removed
some
estranged
others
dealt
awfully
with
all
many
a
hand
is
cold
that
wrote
those
kindly
memorials
and
that
we
pressed
in
the
confident
and
generous
grasp
of
youthful
friendship
what
passions
our
friendships
were
in
those
old
days
how
artless
and
void
of

how
the

you
were
never

parted
to

for

through
the
great
mob
on

way
through

are
we
the

men
now
that
wrote
those

that
read
those

that
delivered

so
simple

ludicrously
solemn
parodied
so
artlessly

an

heard
the

raising

round
about

it

which
covers

if
a

sooner

later
the

forgets
you
amidst

then
and
a
host
more
pen
passed
more
than
two
brilliant
and
happy
years
of
his
life
he
had
his
fill
of
pleasure
and
popularity
no
or
was
complete
without
him
and
pen
jovial
wit
and
pen
songs
and
dashing
courage
and
frank
and
manly
bearing
charmed
all
the
undergraduates
and
even
disarmed
the
tutors
who
cried
out
at
his
idleness
and
murmured
about
his
extravagant
way
of
life
though
he
became
the
favourite
and
leader
of
young
men
who
were
much
his
superiors
in
wealth
and
station
he
was
much
too
generous
to
endeavour
to
propitiate
them
by
any
meanness
or
cringing
on
his
own
part
and
would
not
neglect
the
humblest
man
of
his
acquaintance
in
order
to
curry
favour
with
the
richest
young
grandee
in
the
university
his
name
is
still
remembered
at
the
union
debating
club
as
one
of
the
brilliant
orators
of
his
day
by
the
way
from
having
been
an
ardent
tory
in
his
freshman
year
his
principles
took
a
sudden
turn
afterwards
and
he
became
a
liberal
of
the
most
violent
order
he
avowed
himself
a
dantonist
and
asserted
that
louis
the
sixteenth
was
served
right
and
as
for
charles
the
first
he
vowed
that
he
would
chop
off
that
monarch
head
with
his
own
right
hand
were
he
then
in
the
room
at
the
union
debating
club
and
had
cromwell
no
other
executioner
for
the
traitor
he
and
lord
magnus
charters
the
marquis
of
runnymede
son
were
the
most
truculent
republicans
of
their
day
there
are
reputations
of
this
sort
made
quite
independent
of
the
collegiate
hierarchy
in
the
republic
of
gownsmen
a
man
may
be
famous
in
the
and
entirely
unknown
to
the
undergraduates
who
elect
kings
and
chieftains
of
their
own
whom
they
admire
and
obey
as
have
private
black
sovereigns
in
their
own
body
to
whom
they
pay
an
occult
obedience
besides
that
which
they
publicly
profess
for
their
owners
and
drivers
among
the
young
ones
pen
became
famous
and
popular
not
that
he
did
much
but
there
was
a
general
determination
that
he
could
do
a
great
deal
if
he
chose
ah
if
pendennis
of
boniface
would
but
try
the
men
said
he
might
do
he
was
backed
for
the
greek
ode
won
by
smith
of
trinity
everybody
was
sure
he
would
have
the
latin
hexameter
prize
which
brown
of
john
however
carried
off
and
in
this
way
one
university
honour
after
another
was
lost
by
him
until
after
two
or
three
failures
mr
pen
ceased
to
compete
but
he
got
a
declamation
prize
in
his
own
college
and
brought
home
to
his
mother
and
laura
at
fairoaks
a
set
of
begilt
with
the
college
arms
and
so
big
and
magnificent
that
these
ladies
thought
there
had
been
no
such
prize
ever
given
in
a
college
before
as
this
of
pen
and
that
he
had
won
the
very
largest
honour
which
oxbridge
was
capable
of
awarding
as
vacation
after
vacation
and
term
after
term
passed
away
without
the
desired
news
that
pen
had
sate
for
any
scholarship
or
won
any
honour
doctor
portman
grew
mightily
gloomy
in
his
behaviour
towards
arthur
and
adopted
a
sulky
grandeur
of
deportment
towards
him
which
the
lad
returned
by
a
similar
haughtiness
one
vacation
he
did
not
call
upon
the
doctor
at
all
much
to
his
mother
annoyance
who
thought
that
it
was
a
privilege
to
enter
the
at
clavering
and
listened
to
portman
antique
jokes
and
stories
though
ever
so
often
repeated
with
unfailing
veneration
i
can
not
stand
the
doctor
patronising
air
pen
said
he
too
kind
to
me
a
great
deal
fatherly
i
have
seen
in
the
world
better
men
than
him
and
am
not
going
to
bore
myself
by
listening
to
his
dull
old
stories
and
drinking
his
stupid
old
port
the
tacit
feud
between
pen
and
the
doctor
made
the
widow
nervous
so
that
she
too
avoided
portman
and
was
afraid
to
go
to
the
rectory
when
arthur
was
at
home
one
sunday
in
the
last
long
vacation
the
wretched
boy
pushed
his
rebellious
spirit
so
far
as
not
to
go
to
church
and
he
was
seen
at
the
gate
of
the
clavering
arms
smoking
a
cigar
in
the
face
of
the
congregation
as
it
issued
from
mary
there
was
an
awful
sensation
in
the
village
society
portman
prophesied
pen
ruin
after
that
and
groaned
in
spirit
over
the
rebellious
young
prodigal
so
did
helen
tremble
in
her
heart
and
little
laura
laura
had
grown
to
be
a
fine
young
stripling
by
this
time
graceful
and
fair
clinging
round
helen
and
worshipping
her
with
a
passionate
affection
both
of
these
women
felt
that
their
boy
was
changed
he
was
no
longer
the
artless
pen
of
old
days
so
brave
so
artless
so
impetuous
and
tender
his
face
looked
careworn
and
haggard
his
voice
had
a
deeper
sound
and
tones
more
sarcastic
care
seemed
to
be
pursuing
him
but
he
only
laughed
when
his
mother
questioned
him
and
parried
her
anxious
queries
with
some
scornful
jest
nor
did
he
spend
much
of
his
vacations
at
home
he
went
on
visits
to
one
great
friend
or
another
and
scared
the
quiet
pair
at
fairoaks
by
stories
of
great
houses
whither
he
had
been
invited
and
by
talking
of
lords
without
their
titles
honest
harry
foker
who
had
been
the
means
of
introducing
arthur
pendennis
to
that
set
of
young
men
at
the
university
from
whose
society
and
connexions
arthur
uncle
expected
that
the
lad
would
get
so
much
benefit
who
had
called
for
arthur
first
song
at
his
first
and
who
had
presented
him
at
the
barmecide
club
where
none
but
the
very
best
men
of
oxbridge
were
admitted
it
consisted
in
pen
time
of
six
noblemen
eight
and
twelve
of
the
most
select
commoners
of
the
university
soon
found
himself
left
far
behind
by
the
young
freshman
in
the
fashionable
world
of
oxbridge
and
being
a
generous
and
worthy
fellow
without
a
spark
of
envy
in
his
composition
was
exceedingly
pleased
at
the
success
of
his
young
protege
and
admired
pen
quite
as
much
as
any
of
the
other
youth
did
it
was
he
who
followed
pen
now
and
quoted
his
sayings
learned
his
songs
and
retailed
them
at
minor
and
was
never
weary
of
hearing
them
from
the
gifted
young
poet
own
mouth
for
a
good
deal
of
the
time
which
mr
pen
might
have
employed
much
more
advantageously
in
the
pursuit
of
the
regular
scholastic
studies
was
given
up
to
the
composition
of
secular
ballads
which
he
sang
about
at
parties
according
to
university
wont
it
had
been
as
well
for
arthur
if
the
honest
foker
had
remained
for
some
time
at
college
for
with
all
his
vivacity
he
was
a
prudent
young
man
and
often
curbed
pen
propensity
to
extravagance
but
collegiate
career
did
not
last
very
long
after
arthur
entrance
at
boniface
repeated
differences
with
the
university
authorities
caused
foker
to
quit
oxbridge
in
an
untimely
manner
he
would
persist
in
attending
races
on
the
neighbouring
hungerford
heath
in
spite
of
the
injunctions
of
his
academic
superiors
he
never
could
be
got
to
frequent
the
chapel
of
the
college
with
that
regularity
of
piety
which
alma
mater
demands
from
her
children
tandems
which
are
abominations
in
the
eyes
of
the
heads
and
tutors
were
foker
greatest
delight
and
so
reckless
was
his
driving
and
frequent
the
accidents
and
upsets
out
of
his
drag
that
pen
called
taking
a
drive
with
him
taking
the
diversions
of
purley
finally
having
a
at
his
rooms
to
entertain
some
friends
from
london
nothing
would
satisfy
foker
but
painting
buck
door
vermilion
in
which
freak
he
was
caught
by
the
proctors
and
although
young
black
strap
the
celebrated
negro
fighter
who
was
one
of
foker
distinguished
guests
and
was
holding
the
can
of
paint
while
the
young
artist
operated
on
the
door
knocked
down
two
of
the
attendants
and
performed
prodigies
of
valour
yet
these
feats
rather
injured
than
served
foker
whom
the
proctor
knew
very
well
and
who
was
taken
with
the
brush
in
his
hand
and
who
was
summarily
convened
and
sent
down
from
the
university
the
tutor
wrote
a
very
kind
and
feeling
letter
to
lady
agnes
on
the
subject
stating
that
everybody
was
fond
of
the
youth
that
he
never
meant
harm
to
any
mortal
creature
that
he
for
his
own
part
would
have
been
delighted
to
pardon
the
harmless
little
boyish
frolic
had
not
its
unhappy
publicity
rendered
it
impossible
to
look
the
freak
over
and
breathing
the
most
fervent
wishes
for
the
young
fellow
welfare
wishes
no
doubt
sincere
for
foker
as
we
know
came
of
a
noble
family
on
his
mother
side
and
on
the
other
was
heir
to
a
great
number
of
thousand
pounds
a
year
it
do
matter
said
foker
talking
over
the
matter
with
pen
a
little
sooner
or
a
little
later
what
is
the
odds
i
should
have
been
plucked
for
my
again
i
know
i
should
that
latin
i
can
not
screw
into
my
head
and
my
mamma
anguish
would
have
broke
out
next
term
the
governor
will
blow
like
an
old
grampus
i
know
he
will
well
we
must
stop
till
he
gets
his
wind
again
i
shall
probably

nor

box
nor

i
let
you
off

but
pen
laughingly
said
that
though
it
was
convenient
to
him
to
pay
the
two
ponies
at
that
moment
he
by
no
means
wished
to
be
let
off
any
just
debts
he
owed
and
he
and
foker
parted
not
without
many
dark
forebodings
on
the
latter
part
with
regard
to
his
friend
who
harry
thought
was
travelling
speedily
on
the
road
to
ruin
one
must
do
at
rome
as
rome
does
pen
said
in
a
dandified
manner
jingling
some
sovereigns
in
his
a
little
quiet
play
at
ecarte
ca
hurt
a
man
who
plays
pretty
well
i
came
away
fourteen
sovereigns
richer
from
ringwood
supper
and
gad
i
wanted
the
and
he
walked
off
after
having
taken
leave
of
poor
foker
who
went
away
without
any
beat
of
drum
or
offer
to
drive
the
coach
out
of
oxbridge
to
superintend
a
little
dinner
which
he
was
going
to
give
at
his
own
rooms
in
boniface
about
which
dinners
the
cook
of
the
college
who
had
a
great
respect
for
pendennis
always
took
especial
pains
for
his
young
favourite
chapter
xx
rake
progress
some
short
time
before
foker
departure
from
oxbridge
there
had
come
up
to
boniface
a
gentleman
who
had
once
as
it
turned
out
belonged
to
the
other
university
of
camford
which
he
had
quitted
on
account
of
some
differences
with
the
tutors
and
authorities
there
this
gentleman
whose
name
was
horace
bloundell
was
of
the
ancient
suffolk
family
of
of
hall
as
the
young
wags
used
to
call
it
and
no
doubt
it
was
on
account
of
his
descent
and
because
donne
the
master
of
boniface
was
a
suffolk
man
and
related
perhaps
to
the
family
that
horace
bloundell
was
taken
in
at
boniface
after
george
and
one
or
two
other
colleges
had
refused
to
receive
him
there
was
a
living
in
the
family
which
it
was
important
for
bloundell
to
hold
and
being
in
a
dragoon
regiment
at
the
time
when
his
third
brother
for
whom
the
living
was
originally
intended
sickened
and
died
bloundell
determined
upon
quitting
crimson
pantaloons
and
sable
shakos
for
the
black
coat
and
white
neckcloth
of
the
english
divine
the
misfortunes
which
occurred
at
camford
occasioned
some
slight
disturbance
to
bloundell
plans
but
although
defeated
upon
one
occasion
the
resolute
was
not
dismayed
and
set
to
work
to
win
a
victory
elsewhere
in
pen
second
year
major
pendennis
paid
a
brief
visit
to
his
nephew
and
was
introduced
to
several
of
pen
university
friends
the
gentle
and
polite
lord
plinlimmon
the
gallant
and
magnus
charters
the
sly
and
witty
harland
the
intrepid
ringwood
who
was
called
rupert
in
the
union
debating
club
from
his
opinions
and
the
bravery
of
his
blunders
broadbent
styled
barebones
broadbent
from
the
republican
nature
of
his
opinions
he
was
of
a
dissenting
family
from
bristol
and
a
perfect
boanerges
of
debate
finally
who
had
at
once
taken
his
place
among
the
select
of
the
university
major
pendennis
though
he
did
not
understand
harland
greek
quotations
or
quite
appreciate
broadbent
thick
shoes
and
dingy
hands
was
nevertheless
delighted
with
the
company
assembled
round
his
nephew
and
highly
approved
of
all
the
young
men
with
the
exception
of
that
one
who
gave
himself
the
greatest
airs
in
the
society
and
affected
most
to
have
the
manners
of
a
man
of
the
world
as
he
and
pen
sate
at
breakfast
on
the
morning
after
the
party
in
the
rooms
of
the
latter
the
major
gave
his
opinions
regarding
the
young
men
with
whom
he
was
in
the
greatest
he
had
regaled
them
with
some
of
his
stories
which
though
not
quite
so
fresh
in
london
where
people
have
a
diseased
appetite
for
novelty
in
the
way
of
anecdotes
were
entirely
new
at
oxbridge
and
the
lads
heard
them
with
that
honest
sympathy
that
eager
pleasure
that
boisterous
laughter
or
that
profound
respect
so
rare
in
the
metropolis
and
which
must
be
so
delightful
to
the
professed
raconteur
only
once
or
twice
during
the
telling
of
the
anecdote
bloundell
face
wore
a
look
of
scorn
or
betrayed
by
its
expression
that
he
was
acquainted
with
the
tales
narrated
once
he
had
the
audacity
to
question
the
accuracy
of
one
of
the
particulars
of
a
tale
as
given
by
major
pendennis
and
gave
his
own
version
of
the
anecdote
about
which
he
knew
he
was
right
for
he
heard
it
openly
talked
of
at
the
club
by
and
who
were
present
at
the
business
the
youngsters
present
looked
up
with
wonder
at
their
associate
who
dared
to
interrupt
the
major
few
of
them
could
appreciate
that
melancholy
grace
and
politeness
with
which
major
pendennis
at
once
acceded
to
bloundell
version
of
the
story
and
thanked
him
for
correcting
his
own
error
they
stared
on
the
next
occasion
of
meeting
when
bloundell
spoke
in
contemptuous
terms
of
old
pen
said
everybody
knew
old
pen
regular
old
trencherman
at
gaunt
house
notorious
old
bore
regular
old
fogy
major
pendennis
on
his
side
liked
bloundell
not
a
whit
these
sympathies
are
pretty
sure
to
be
mutual
amongst
men
and
women
and
if
for
my
part
some
kind
friend
tells
me
that
such
and
such
a
man
has
been
abusing
me
i
am
almost
sure
on
my
own
side
that
i
have
a
misliking
to
such
and
such
a
man
we
like
or
dislike
each
other
as
folks
like
or
dislike
the
odour
of
certain
flowers
or
the
taste
of
certain
dishes
or
wines
or
certain
books
we
ca
tell
why
but
as
a
general
rule
all
the
reasons
in
the
world
will
not
make
us
love
fell
and
as
sure
as
we
dislike
him
we
may
be
sure
that
he
dislikes
us
so
the
major
said
pen
my
boy
your
dinner
went
off
a
merveille
you
did
the
honours
very
nicely
you
carved
well
i
am
glad
you
learned
to
carve
it
is
done
on
the
sideboard
now
in
most
good
houses
but
is
still
an
important
point
and
may
aid
you
in
young
lord
plinlimmon
is
a
very
amiable
young
man
quite
the
image
of
his
dear
mother
whom
i
knew
as
lady
aquila
brownbill
and
lord
republicanism
will
wear
off
it
sits
prettily
enough
on
a
young
patrician
in
early
life
though
nothing
is
so
loathsome
among
persons
of
our
rank
broadbent
seems
to
have
much
eloquence
and
considerable
reading
your
friend
foker
is
always
delightful
but
your
acquaintance
bloundell
struck
me
as
in
all
respects
a
most
ineligible
young
bless
my
soul
sir
cried
pen
laughing
why
sir
he
the
most
popular
man
of
the
university
we
elected
him
of
the
barmecides
the
first
week
he
came
up
had
a
special
meeting
on
purpose
he
of
an
excellent
family
suffolk
bloundells
descended
from
richard
blondel
bear
a
harp
in
chief
and
motto
o
mong
a
man
may
have
a
very
good
and
be
a
tiger
my
boy
the
major
said
chipping
his
egg
that
man
is
a
tiger
mark
my
word
a
low
man
i
will
lay
a
wager
that
he
left
his
regiment
which
was
a
good
one
for
a
more
respectable
man
than
my
friend
lord
martingale
never
sate
in
a
saddle
in
bad
odour
there
is
the
unmistakable
look
of
slang
and
bad
habits
about
this
bloundell
he
frequents
low
and
sir
he
haunts
clubs
i
know
he
does
i
know
by
his
style
i
never
was
mistaken
in
my
man
yet
did
you
remark
the
quantity
of
rings
and
jewellery
he
wore
that
person
has
scamp
written
on
his
countenance
if
any
man
ever
had
mark
my
words
and
avoid
him
let
us
turn
the
conversation
the
dinner
was
a
leetle
too
fine
but
i
do
object
to
your
making
a
few
extra
frais
when
you
receive
friends
of
course
you
do
do
it
often
and
only
those
whom
it
is
your
interest
to
feter
the
cutlets
were
excellent
and
the
souffle
uncommonly
light
and
good
the
third
bottle
of
champagne
was
not
necessary
but
you
have
a
good
income
and
as
long
as
you
keep
within
it
i
shall
not
quarrel
with
you
my
dear
poor
pen
the
worthy
uncle
little
knew
how
often
those
dinners
took
place
while
the
reckless
young
amphitryon
delighted
to
show
his
hospitality
and
skill
in
gourmandise
there
is
no
art
than
that
so
long
to
learn
so
difficult
to
acquire
so
impossible
and
beyond
the
means
of
many
unhappy
people
about
which
boys
are
more
anxious
to
have
an
air
of
knowingness
a
taste
and
knowledge
of
wines
and
cookery
appears
to
them
to
be
the
sign
of
an
accomplished
roue
and
manly
gentleman
i
like
to
see
them
wink
at
a
glass
of
claret
as
if
they
had
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
it
and
discuss
a
salmi
poor
boys
it
is
only
when
they
grow
old
that
they
know
they
know
nothing
of
the
science
when
perhaps
their
conscience
whispers
them
that
the
science
is
in
itself
little
worth
and
that
a
leg
of
mutton
and
content
is
as
good
as
the
dinners
of
pontiffs
but
little
pen
in
his
character
of
admirable
crichton
thought
it
necessary
to
be
a
great
judge
and
practitioner
of
dinners
we
have
just
said
how
the
college
cook
respected
him
and
shall
soon
have
to
deplore
that
that
worthy
man
so
blindly
trusted
our
pen
in
the
third
year
of
the
lad
residence
at
oxbridge
his
staircase
was
by
no
means
encumbered
with
and
desserts
and
waiters
carrying
in
dishes
and
skips
opening
iced
champagne
crowds
of
different
sorts
of
attendants
with
faces
sulky
or
piteous
hung
about
the
outer
oak
and
assailed
the
unfortunate
lad
as
he
issued
out
of
his
den
nor
did
his
guardian
advice
take
any
effect
or
induce
mr
pen
to
avoid
the
society
of
the
disreputable
bloundell
what
young
men
like
in
their
companions
is
what
had
got
pen
a
great
part
of
his
own
repute
and
popularity
a
real
or
supposed
knowledge
of
life
a
man
who
has
seen
the
world
or
can
speak
of
it
with
a
knowing
air
a
roue
or
lovelace
who
has
his
adventures
to
relate
is
sure
of
an
admiring
audience
among
boys
it
is
hard
to
confess
but
so
it
is
we
respect
that
sort
of
prowess
from
our
we
have
been
taught
to
admire
it
are
there
five
in
the
hundred
out
of
the
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
english
brought
up
at
our
great
schools
and
colleges
that
must
not
own
at
one
time
of
their
lives
to
having
read
and
liked
don
juan
awful
propagation
of
evil
the
idea
of
it
should
make
the
man
tremble
who
holds
the
pen
lest
untruth
or
impurity
or
unjust
anger
or
unjust
praise
escape
it
one
such
diseased
creature
as
this
is
enough
to
infect
a
whole
colony
and
the
tutors
of
boniface
began
to
find
the
moral
tone
of
their
college
lowered
and
their
young
men
growing
unruly
and
almost
soon
after
bloundell
arrival
at
oxbridge
the
young
magnates
of
the
neighbouring
great
college
of
george
who
regarded
pen
and
in
whose
society
he
lived
were
not
taken
in
by
bloundell
flashy
graces
and
rakish
airs
of
fashion
broadbent
called
him
captain
macheath
and
said
he
would
live
to
be
hanged
foker
during
his
brief
stay
at
the
university
with
macheath
with
characteristic
caution
declined
to
say
anything
in
the
captain
disfavour
but
hinted
to
pen
that
he
had
better
have
him
for
a
partner
at
whist
than
play
against
him
and
better
back
him
at
ecarte
than
bet
on
the
other
side
you
see
he
plays
better
than
you
do
pen
was
the
astute
young
gentleman
remark
he
plays
uncommon
well
the
captain
does
and
pen
i
would
take
the
odds
too
freely
from
him
if
i
was
you
i
do
think
he
too
flush
of
money
the
captain
but
beyond
these
dark
suggestions
and
generalities
the
cautious
foker
could
not
be
got
to
speak
not
that
his
advice
would
have
had
more
weight
with
a
headstrong
young
man
than
advice
commonly
has
with
a
lad
who
is
determined
on
pursuing
his
own
way
pen
appetite
for
pleasure
was
insatiable
and
he
rushed
at
it
wherever
it
presented
itself
with
an
eagerness
which
bespoke
his
fiery
constitution
and
youthful
health
he
called
taking
pleasure
seeing
life
and
quoted
maxims
from
terence
from
horace
from
shakspeare
to
show
that
one
should
do
all
that
might
become
a
man
he
bade
fair
to
be
utterly
used
up
and
a
roue
in
a
few
years
if
he
were
to
continue
at
the
pace
at
which
he
was
going
one
night
after
a
in
college
at
which
pen
and
macheath
had
been
present
and
at
which
a
little
quiet
had
been
played
an
amusement
much
pleasanter
to
men
in
their
second
and
third
year
than
the
boisterous
custom
of
singing
songs
which
bring
the
proctors
about
the
rooms
and
which
have
grown
quite
stale
by
this
time
every
man
having
expended
his
budget
as
the
men
had
taken
their
caps
and
were
going
away
after
no
great
losses
or
winnings
on
any
side
bloundell
playfully
took
up
a
green
from
the
which
had
been
destined
to
contain
iced
cup
but
into
which
he
inserted
something
still
more
pernicious
namely
a
pair
of
dice
which
the
gentleman
took
out
of
his
and
put
into
the
glass
then
giving
the
glass
a
graceful
wave
which
showed
that
his
hand
was
quite
experienced
in
the
throwing
of
dice
he
called
sevens
the
main
and
whisking
the
ivory
cubes
gently
on
the
table
swept
them
up
lightly
again
from
the
cloth
and
repeated
this
process
two
or
three
times
the
other
men
looked
on
pen
of
course
among
the
number
who
had
never
used
the
dice
as
yet
except
to
play
a
humdrum
game
of
backgammon
at
home
bloundell
who
had
a
good
voice
began
to
troll
out
the
chorus
from
robert
the
devil
an
opera
then
in
great
vogue
in
which
chorus
many
of
the
men
joined
especially
pen
who
was
in
very
high
spirits
having
won
a
good
number
of
shillings
and
at
the
and
presently
instead
of
going
home
most
of
the
party
were
seated
round
the
table
playing
at
dice
the
green
glass
going
round
from
hand
to
hand
until
pen
finally
shivered
it
after
throwing
six
mains
from
that
night
pen
plunged
into
the
delights
of
the
game
of
hazard
as
eagerly
as
it
was
his
custom
to
pursue
any
new
pleasure
dice
can
be
played
of
mornings
as
well
as
after
dinner
or
supper
bloundell
would
come
into
pen
rooms
after
breakfast
and
it
was
astonishing
how
quick
the
time
passed
as
the
bones
were
rattling
they
had
little
quiet
parties
with
closed
doors
and
bloundell
devised
a
box
lined
with
felt
so
that
the
dice
should
make
no
noise
and
their
rattle
not
bring
the
tutors
up
to
the
rooms
bloundell
ringwood
and
pen
were
once
very
nearly
caught
by
buck
who
passing
in
the
quadrangle
thought
he
heard
the
words
two
to
one
on
the
caster
through
pen
open
window
but
when
the
tutor
got
into
arthur
rooms
he
found
the
lads
with
three
homers
before
them
and
pen
said
he
was
trying
to
coach
the
two
other
men
and
asked
buck
with
great
gravity
what
was
the
present
condition
of
the
river
scamander
and
whether
it
was
navigable
or
no
arthur
pendennis
did
not
win
much
money
in
these
transactions
with
bloundell
or
indeed
gain
good
of
any
kind
except
a
knowledge
of
the
odds
at
hazard
which
he
might
have
learned
out
of
books
captain
macheath
had
other
accomplishments
which
he
exercised
for
benefit
the
captain
stories
had
a
great
and
unfortunate
charm
for
arthur
who
was
never
tired
of
hearing
bloundell
histories
of
garrison
conquests
and
of
his
feats
in
he
had
been
at
paris
and
had
plenty
of
legends
about
the
palais
royal
and
the
salon
and
frascati
he
had
gone
to
the
salon
one
night
after
a
dinner
at
the
cafe
de
paris
when
we
were
all
devilishly
cut
by
jove
and
on
waking
in
the
morning
in
my
own
rooms
i
found
myself
with
twelve
thousand
francs
under
my
pillow
and
a
hundred
and
napoleons
in
one
of
my
boots
was
that
a
coup
hay
the
captain
said
pen
eyes
glistened
with
excitement
as
he
heard
this
story
he
respected
the
man
who
could
win
such
a
sum
of
money
he
sighed
and
said
it
would
set
him
all
right
macheath
laughed
and
told
him
to
drink
another
drop
of
maraschino
i
could
tell
you
stories
much
more
wonderful
than
that
he
added
and
so
indeed
the
captain
could
have
done
without
any
further
trouble
than
that
of
invention
with
which
portion
of
the
poetic
faculty
nature
had
copiously
endowed
him
he
laughed
to
scorn
pen
love
for
miss
fotheringay
when
he
came
to
hear
of
that
amour
from
arthur
as
he
pretty
soon
did
for
we
have
said
pen
was
not
averse
to
telling
the
story
now
to
his
confidential
friends
and
he
and
they
were
rather
proud
of
the
transaction
but
macheath
took
away
all
pen
conceit
on
this
head
not
by
demonstrating
the
folly
of
the
lad
passion
for
an
uneducated
woman
much
his
senior
in
years
but
by
exposing
his
absurd
desire
of
gratifying
his
passion
in
a
legitimate
way
marry
her
said
he
you
might
as
well
marry
and
he
named
one
of
the
most
notorious
actresses
on
the
stage
she
had
a
shred
of
a
he
knew
twenty
men
who
were
openly
admirers
of
her
and
named
them
and
the
sums
each
had
spent
upon
her
i
know
no
kind
of
calumny
more
frightful
or
frequent
than
this
which
takes
away
the
character
of
women
no
men
more
reckless
and
mischievous
than
those
who
lightly
use
it
and
no
kind
of
cowards
more
despicable
than
the
people
who
invent
these
slanders
is
it
or
not
a
misfortune
that
a
man
himself
of
a
candid
disposition
and
disposed
like
our
friend
pen
to
blurt
out
the
truth
on
all
occasions
begins
life
by
believing
all
that
is
said
to
him
would
it
be
better
for
a
lad
to
be
less
trustful
and
so
less
honest
it
requires
no
small
experience
of
the
world
to
know
that
a
man
who
has
no
especial
reason
thereto
is
telling
you
lies
i
am
not
sure
whether
it
is
not
best
to
go
on
being
duped
for
a
certain
time
at
all
events
our
honest
pen
had
a
natural
credulity
which
enabled
him
to
accept
all
statements
which
were
made
to
him
and
he
took
every
one
of
captain
figments
as
if
they
had
been
the
most
unquestioned
facts
of
history
so
bloundell
account
about
miss
fotheringay
pained
and
mortified
pen
exceedingly
if
he
had
been
ashamed
of
his
passion
before
what
were
his
feelings
regarding
it
now
when
the
object
of
so
much
pure
flame
and
adoration
turned
out
to
be
only
a
worthless
impostor
an
impostor
detected
by
all
but
him
it
never
occurred
to
pen
to
doubt
the
fact
or
to
question
whether
the
stories
of
a
man
who
like
his
new
friend
never
spoke
well
of
any
woman
were
likely
to
be
true
one
easter
vacation
when
pen
had
announced
to
his
mother
and
uncle
his
intention
not
to
go
down
but
stay
at
oxbridge
and
read
mr
pen
was
nevertheless
induced
to
take
a
brief
visit
to
london
in
company
with
his
friend
bloundell
they
put
up
at
a
hotel
in
covent
garden
where
bloundell
had
a
tick
as
he
called
it
and
took
the
pleasures
of
the
town
very
freely
after
the
wont
of
young
university
men
bloundell
still
belonged
to
a
military
club
whither
he
took
pen
to
dine
once
or
twice
the
young
men
would
drive
thither
in
a
cab
trembling
lest
they
should
meet
major
pendennis
on
his
beat
in
pall
mall
and
here
pen
was
introduced
to
a
number
of
gallant
young
fellows
with
spurs
and
mustachios
with
whom
he
drank
of
mornings
and
beat
the
town
of
a
night
here
he
saw
a
deal
of
life
indeed
nor
in
his
career
about
the
theatres
and
which
these
roaring
young
blades
frequented
was
he
very
likely
to
meet
his
guardian
one
night
nevertheless
they
were
very
near
to
each
other
a
plank
only
separating
pen
who
was
in
the
boxes
of
the
museum
theatre
from
the
major
who
was
in
lord
steyne
box
along
with
that
venerated
nobleman
the
fotheringay
was
in
the
pride
of
her
glory
she
had
made
a
hit
that
is
she
had
drawn
very
good
houses
for
nearly
a
year
had
starred
the
provinces
with
great
eclat
had
come
back
to
shine
in
london
with
somewhat
diminished
lustre
and
now
was
acting
with
ever
increasing
attraction
triumph
of
the
good
old
british
drama
as
the
avowed
to
houses
in
which
there
was
plenty
of
room
for
anybody
who
wanted
to
see
her
it
was
not
the
first
time
pen
had
seen
her
since
that
memorable
day
when
the
two
had
parted
in
chatteris
in
the
previous
year
when
the
town
was
making
much
of
her
and
the
press
lauded
her
beauty
pen
had
found
a
pretext
for
coming
to
london
in
and
had
rushed
off
to
the
theatre
to
see
his
old
flame
he
recollected
it
rather
than
renewed
it
he
remembered
how
ardently
he
used
to
be
on
the
at
chatteris
when
the
speech
before
ophelia
or
haller
entrance
on
the
stage
was
made
by
the
proper
actor
now
as
the
actor
spoke
he
had
a
sort
of
feeble
thrill
as
the
house
began
to
thunder
with
applause
and
ophelia
entered
with
her
old
bow
and
sweeping
curtsey
pen
felt
a
slight
shock
and
blushed
very
much
as
he
looked
at
her
and
could
not
help
thinking
that
all
the
house
was
regarding
him
he
hardly
heard
her
for
the
first
part
of
the
play
and
he
thought
with
such
rage
of
the
humiliation
to
which
she
had
subjected
him
that
he
began
to
fancy
he
was
jealous
and
in
love
with
her
still
but
that
illusion
did
not
last
very
long
he
ran
round
to
the
of
the
theatre
to
see
her
if
possible
but
he
did
not
succeed
she
passed
indeed
under
his
nose
with
a
female
companion
but
he
did
not
know
her
nor
did
she
recognise
him
the
next
night
he
came
in
late
and
stayed
very
quietly
for
the
afterpiece
and
on
the
third
and
last
night
of
his
stay
in
london
why
taglioni
was
going
to
dance
at
the
opera
taglioni
and
there
was
to
be
don
giovanni
which
he
admired
of
all
things
in
the
world
so
mr
pen
went
to
don
giovanni
and
taglioni
this
time
the
illusion
about
her
was
quite
gone
she
was
not
less
handsome
but
she
was
not
the
same
somehow
the
light
was
gone
out
of
her
eyes
which
used
to
flash
there
or
pen
no
longer
were
dazzled
by
it
the
rich
voice
spoke
as
of
old
yet
it
did
not
make
pen
bosom
thrill
as
formerly
he
thought
he
could
recognise
the
brogue
underneath
the
accents
seemed
to
him
coarse
and
false
it
annoyed
him
to
hear
the
same
emphasis
on
the
same
words
only
uttered
a
little
louder
worse
than
this
it
annoyed
him
to
think
that
he
should
ever
have
mistaken
that
loud
imitation
for
genius
or
melted
at
those
mechanical
sobs
and
sighs
he
felt
that
it
was
in
another
life
almost
that
it
was
another
man
who
had
so
madly
loved
her
he
was
ashamed
and
bitterly
humiliated
and
very
lonely
ah
poor
pen
the
delusion
is
better
than
the
truth
sometimes
and
fine
dreams
than
dismal
waking
they
went
and
had
an
uproarious
supper
that
night
and
mr
pen
had
a
fine
headache
the
next
morning
with
which
he
went
back
to
oxbridge
having
spent
all
his
ready
money
as
all
this
narrative
is
taken
from
pen
own
confessions
so
that
the
reader
may
be
assured
of
the
truth
of
every
word
of
it
and
as
pen
himself
never
had
any
accurate
notion
of
the
manner
in
which
he
spent
his
money
and
plunged
himself
in
much
deeper
pecuniary
difficulties
during
his
luckless
residence
at
oxbridge
university
it
is
of
course
impossible
for
me
to
give
any
accurate
account
of
his
involvements
beyond
that
general
notion
of
his
way
of
life
which
has
been
sketched
a
few
pages
back
he
does
not
speak
too
hardly
of
the
roguery
of
the
university
tradesmen
or
of
those
in
london
whom
he
honoured
with
his
patronage
at
the
outset
of
his
career
even
finch
the
to
whom
bloundell
introduced
him
and
with
whom
he
had
various
transactions
in
which
the
young
rascal
signature
appeared
upon
stamped
paper
treated
him
according
to
pen
own
account
with
forbearance
and
never
mulcted
him
of
more
than
a
hundred
per
cent
the
old
his
fervent
admirer
made
him
a
private
bill
offered
to
send
him
in
dinners
up
to
the
very
last
and
never
would
have
pressed
his
account
to
his
dying
day
there
was
that
kindness
and
frankness
about
arthur
pendennis
which
won
most
people
who
came
in
contact
with
him
and
which
if
it
rendered
him
an
easy
prey
to
rogues
got
him
perhaps
more
goodwill
than
he
merited
from
many
honest
men
it
was
impossible
to
resist
his
or
in
his
worst
moments
not
to
hope
for
his
rescue
from
utter
ruin
at
the
time
of
his
full
career
of
university
pleasure
he
would
leave
the
gayest
party
to
go
and
sit
with
a
sick
friend
he
never
knew
the
difference
between
small
and
great
in
the
treatment
of
his
acquaintances
however
much
the
unlucky
lad
tastes
which
were
of
the
sumptuous
order
led
him
to
prefer
good
society
he
was
only
too
ready
to
share
his
guinea
with
a
poor
friend
and
when
he
got
money
had
an
irresistible
propensity
for
paying
which
he
never
could
conquer
through
life
in
his
third
year
at
college
the
duns
began
to
gather
awfully
round
about
him
and
there
was
a
levee
at
his
oak
which
scandalised
the
tutors
and
would
have
scared
many
a
stouter
heart
with
some
of
these
he
used
to
battle
some
he
would
bully
under
directions
who
was
a
master
in
this
art
though
he
took
a
degree
in
no
other
and
some
deprecate
and
it
is
reported
of
him
that
little
mary
frodsham
the
daughter
of
a
certain
poor
gilder
and
whom
mr
pen
had
thought
fit
to
employ
and
who
had
made
a
number
of
beautiful
frames
for
his
fine
prints
coming
to
pendennis
with
a
piteous
tale
that
her
father
was
ill
with
ague
and
that
there
was
an
execution
in
their
house
pen
in
an
anguish
of
remorse
rushed
away
pawned
his
grand
watch
and
every
single
article
of
jewellery
except
two
old
gold
which
had
belonged
to
his
father
and
rushed
with
the
proceeds
to
frodsham
shop
where
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
the
deepest
repentance
and
humility
he
asked
the
poor
tradesman
pardon
this
young
gentlemen
is
not
told
as
an
instance
of
pen
virtue
but
rather
of
his
weakness
it
would
have
been
much
more
virtuous
to
have
had
no
prints
at
all
he
still
stood
for
the
baubles
which
he
sold
in
order
to
pay
frodsham
bill
and
his
mother
had
cruelly
to
pinch
herself
in
order
to
discharge
the
jeweller
account
so
that
she
was
in
the
end
the
sufferer
by
the
lad
impertinent
fancies
and
follies
we
are
not
presenting
pen
to
you
as
a
hero
or
a
model
only
as
a
lad
who
in
the
midst
of
a
thousand
vanities
and
weaknesses
has
as
yet
some
generous
impulses
and
is
not
altogether
dishonest
we
have
said
it
was
to
the
scandal
of
buck
the
tutor
that
extravagances
became
known
from
the
manner
in
which
he
entered
college
the
associates
he
kept
and
the
introductions
of
doctor
portman
and
the
major
buck
for
a
long
time
thought
that
his
pupil
was
a
man
of
large
property
and
wondered
rather
that
he
only
wore
a
plain
gown
once
on
going
up
to
london
to
the
levee
with
an
address
from
his
majesty
loyal
university
of
oxbridge
buck
had
seen
major
pendennis
at
james
in
conversation
with
two
knights
of
the
garter
in
the
carriage
of
one
of
whom
the
dazzled
tutor
saw
the
major
whisked
away
after
the
levee
he
asked
pen
to
wine
the
instant
he
came
back
let
him
off
from
chapels
and
lectures
more
than
ever
and
felt
perfectly
sure
that
he
was
a
young
gentleman
of
large
estate
thus
he
was
thunderstruck
when
he
heard
the
truth
and
received
a
dismal
confession
from
pen
his
university
debts
were
large
and
the
tutor
had
nothing
to
do
and
of
course
pen
did
not
acquaint
him
with
his
london
debts
what
man
ever
does
tell
all
when
pressed
by
his
friends
about
his
liabilities
the
tutor
learned
enough
to
know
that
pen
was
poor
that
he
had
spent
a
handsome
almost
a
magnificent
allowance
and
had
raised
around
him
such
a
fine
crop
of
debts
as
it
would
be
very
hard
work
for
any
man
to
mow
down
for
there
is
no
plant
that
grows
so
rapidly
when
once
it
has
taken
root
perhaps
it
was
because
she
was
so
tender
and
good
that
pen
was
terrified
lest
his
mother
should
know
of
his
sins
i
ca
bear
to
break
it
to
her
he
said
to
the
tutor
in
an
agony
of
grief
o
sir
i
been
a
villain
to
her
and
he
repented
and
he
wished
he
had
the
time
to
come
over
again
and
he
asked
himself
why
why
did
his
uncle
insist
upon
the
necessity
of
living
with
great
people
and
in
how
much
did
all
his
grand
acquaintance
profit
him
they
were
not
shy
but
pen
thought
they
were
and
slunk
from
them
during
his
last
terms
at
college
he
was
as
gloomy
as
a
at
parties
which
he
avoided
of
his
own
part
or
to
which
his
young
friends
soon
ceased
to
invite
him
everybody
knew
that
pendennis
was
hard
that
man
bloundell
who
could
pay
nobody
and
who
was
obliged
to
go
down
after
three
terms
was
his
ruin
the
men
said
his
melancholy
figure
might
be
seen
shirking
about
the
lonely
quadrangles
in
his
battered
old
cap
and
torn
gown
and
he
who
had
been
the
pride
of
the
university
but
a
year
before
the
man
whom
all
the
young
ones
loved
to
look
at
was
now
the
object
of
conversation
at
freshmen
and
they
spoke
of
him
with
wonder
and
awe
at
last
came
the
degree
examinations
many
a
young
man
of
his
year
whose
shoes
pen
had
derided
and
whose
face
or
coat
he
had
caricatured
many
a
man
whom
he
had
treated
with
scorn
in
the
or
crushed
with
his
eloquence
in
the
many
of
his
own
set
who
had
not
half
his
brains
but
a
little
regularity
and
constancy
of
occupation
took
high
places
in
the
honours
or
passed
with
decent
credit
and
where
in
the
list
was
pen
the
superb
pen
the
wit
and
dandy
pen
the
poet
and
orator
ah
where
was
pen
the
widow
darling
and
sole
pride
let
us
hide
our
heads
and
shut
up
the
page
the
lists
came
out
and
a
dreadful
rumour
rushed
through
the
university
that
pendennis
of
boniface
was
plucked
chapter
xxi
flight
after
defeat
everybody
who
has
the
least
knowledge
of
heraldry
and
the
peerage
must
be
aware
that
the
noble
family
of
which
as
we
know
helen
pendennis
was
a
member
bears
for
a
crest
a
nest
full
of
little
pelicans
pecking
at
the
ensanguined
bosom
of
a
big
maternal
bird
which
plentifully
supplies
the
little
wretches
with
the
nutriment
on
which
according
to
the
heraldic
legend
they
are
supposed
to
be
brought
up
very
likely
female
pelicans
like
so
to
bleed
under
the
selfish
little
beaks
of
their
young
ones
it
is
certain
that
women
do
there
must
be
some
sort
of
pleasure
which
we
men
do
understand
which
accompanies
the
pain
of
being
scarified
and
indeed
i
believe
some
women
would
rather
actually
so
suffer
than
not
they
like
sacrificing
themselves
in
behalf
of
the
object
which
their
instinct
teaches
them
to
love
be
it
for
a
reckless
husband
a
dissipated
son
a
darling
scapegrace
of
a
brother
how
ready
their
hearts
are
to
pour
out
their
best
treasures
for
the
benefit
of
the
cherished
person
and
what
a
deal
of
this
sort
of
enjoyment
are
we
on
one
side
ready
to
give
the
soft
creatures
there
is
scarce
a
man
that
reads
this
but
has
administered
pleasure
in
this
fashion
to
his
womankind
and
has
treated
them
to
the
luxury
of
forgiving
him
they
do
mind
how
they
live
themselves
but
when
the
prodigal
comes
home
they
make
a
rejoicing
and
kill
the
fatted
calf
for
him
and
at
the
very
first
hint
that
the
sinner
is
returning
the
kind
angels
prepare
their
festival
and
mercy
and
forgiveness
go
smiling
out
to
welcome
him
i
hope
it
may
be
so
always
for
all
if
we
have
only
justice
to
look
to
heaven
help
us
during
the
latter
part
of
pen
residence
at
the
university
of
oxbridge
his
uncle
partiality
had
greatly
increased
for
the
lad
the
major
was
proud
of
arthur
who
had
high
spirits
frank
manners
a
good
person
and
high
bearing
it
pleased
the
old
london
bachelor
to
see
pen
walking
with
the
young
patricians
of
his
university
and
he
who
was
never
known
to
entertain
his
friends
and
whose
stinginess
had
passed
into
a
sort
of
byword
among
some
wags
at
the
club
who
envied
his
many
engagements
and
did
not
choose
to
consider
his
poverty
was
charmed
to
give
his
nephew
and
the
young
lords
snug
little
dinners
at
his
lodgings
and
to
regale
them
with
good
claret
and
his
very
best
bons
mots
and
stories
some
of
which
would
be
injured
by
the
repetition
for
the
major
manner
of
telling
them
was
incomparably
neat
and
careful
and
others
whereof
the
repetition
would
do
good
to
nobody
he
paid
his
court
to
their
parents
through
the
young
men
and
to
himself
as
it
were
by
their
company
he
made
more
than
one
visit
to
oxbridge
where
the
young
fellows
were
amused
by
entertaining
the
old
gentleman
and
gave
parties
and
breakfasts
and
fetes
partly
to
joke
him
and
partly
to
do
him
honour
he
plied
them
with
his
stories
he
made
himself
juvenile
and
hilarious
in
the
company
of
the
young
lords
he
went
to
hear
pen
at
a
grand
debate
at
the
union
crowed
and
cheered
and
rapped
his
stick
in
chorus
with
the
cheers
of
the
men
and
was
astounded
at
the
eloquence
and
fire
he
thought
he
had
got
a
young
pitt
for
a
nephew
he
had
an
almost
paternal
fondness
for
pen
he
wrote
to
the
lad
letters
with
playful
advice
and
the
news
of
the
town
he
bragged
about
arthur
at
his
clubs
and
introduced
him
with
pleasure
into
his
conversation
saying
that
egad
the
young
fellows
were
putting
the
old
ones
to
the
wall
that
the
lads
who
were
coming
up
young
lord
plinlimmon
a
friend
of
my
boy
young
lord
magnus
charters
a
chum
of
my
scapegrace
would
make
a
greater
figure
in
the
world
than
even
their
fathers
had
done
before
them
he
asked
permission
to
bring
arthur
to
a
grand
fete
at
gaunt
house
saw
him
with
ineffable
satisfaction
dancing
with
the
sisters
of
the
young
noblemen
before
mentioned
and
gave
himself
as
much
trouble
to
procure
cards
of
invitation
for
the
lad
to
some
good
houses
as
if
he
had
been
a
mamma
with
a
daughter
to
marry
and
not
an
old
officer
in
a
wig
and
he
boasted
everywhere
of
the
boy
great
talents
and
remarkable
oratorical
powers
and
of
the
brilliant
degree
he
was
going
to
take
lord
runnymede
would
take
him
on
his
embassy
or
the
duke
would
bring
him
in
for
one
of
his
boroughs
he
wrote
over
and
over
again
to
helen
who
for
her
part
was
too
ready
to
believe
anything
that
anybody
chose
to
say
in
favour
of
her
son
and
all
this
pride
and
affection
of
uncle
and
mother
had
been
trampled
down
by
pen
wicked
extravagance
and
idleness
i
do
envy
feelings
as
the
phrase
is
as
he
thought
of
what
he
had
done
he
had
slept
and
the
tortoise
had
won
the
race
he
had
marred
at
its
outset
what
might
have
been
a
brilliant
career
he
had
dipped
ungenerously
into
a
generous
mother
purse
basely
and
recklessly
spilt
her
little
cruse
o
it
was
a
coward
hand
that
could
strike
and
rob
a
creature
so
tender
and
if
pen
felt
the
wrong
which
he
had
done
to
others
are
we
to
suppose
that
a
young
gentleman
of
his
vanity
did
not
feel
still
more
keenly
the
shame
he
had
brought
upon
himself
let
us
be
assured
that
there
is
no
more
cruel
remorse
than
that
and
no
groans
more
piteous
than
those
of
wounded
like
joel
miller
friend
the
senior
wrangler
who
bowed
to
the
audience
from
his
box
at
the
play
because
he
and
the
king
happened
to
enter
the
theatre
at
the
same
time
only
with
a
fatuity
by
no
means
so
agreeable
to
himself
poor
arthur
pendennis
felt
perfectly
convinced
that
all
england
would
remark
the
absence
of
his
name
from
the
and
talk
about
his
misfortune
his
wounded
tutor
his
many
duns
the
skip
and
who
waited
upon
him
the
undergraduates
of
his
own
time
and
the
years
below
him
whom
he
had
patronised
or
scorned
how
could
he
bear
to
look
any
of
them
in
the
face
now
he
rushed
to
his
rooms
into
which
he
shut
himself
and
there
he
penned
a
letter
to
his
tutor
full
of
thanks
regards
remorse
and
despair
requesting
that
his
name
might
be
taken
off
the
college
books
and
intimating
a
wish
and
expectation
that
death
would
speedily
end
the
woes
of
the
disgraced
arthur
pendennis
then
he
slunk
out
scarcely
knowing
whither
he
went
but
mechanically
taking
the
unfrequented
little
lanes
by
the
backs
of
the
colleges
until
he
cleared
the
university
precincts
and
got
down
to
the
banks
of
the
camisis
river
now
deserted
but
so
often
alive
with
the
and
the
crowds
of
cheering
gownsmen
he
wandered
on
and
on
until
he
found
himself
at
some
miles
distance
from
oxbridge
or
rather
was
found
by
some
acquaintances
leaving
that
city
as
pen
went
up
a
hill
a
drizzling
january
rain
beating
in
his
face
and
his
ragged
gown
flying
behind
him
for
he
had
not
divested
himself
of
his
academical
garments
since
the
morning
a
postchaise
came
rattling
up
the
road
on
the
box
of
which
a
servant
was
seated
whilst
within
or
rather
half
out
of
the
carriage
window
sate
a
young
gentleman
smoking
a
cigar
and
loudly
encouraging
the
postboy
it
was
our
young
acquaintance
of
baymouth
spavin
who
had
got
his
degree
and
was
driving
homewards
in
triumph
in
his
yellow
postchaise
he
caught
a
sight
of
the
figure
madly
gesticulating
as
he
worked
up
the
hill
and
of
poor
pale
and
ghastly
face
as
the
chaise
whirled
by
him
wo
roared
spavin
to
the
postboy
and
the
horses
stopped
in
their
mad
career
and
the
carriage
pulled
up
some
fifty
yards
before
pen
he
presently
heard
his
own
name
shouted
and
beheld
the
upper
half
of
the
body
of
spavin
thrust
out
of
the
of
the
vehicle
and
beckoning
pen
vehemently
towards
it
pen
stopped
hesitated
nodded
his
head
fiercely
and
pointed
onwards
as
if
desirous
that
the
postillion
should
proceed
he
did
not
speak
but
his
countenance
must
have
looked
very
desperate
for
young
spavin
having
stared
at
him
with
an
expression
of
blank
alarm
jumped
out
of
the
carriage
presently
ran
towards
pen
holding
out
his
hand
and
grasping
pen
said
i
say
hullo
old
boy
where
are
you
going
and
what
the
row
now
i
going
where
i
deserve
to
go

pen
with
an
imprecation

spavin
smiling

and
after
the
first
time
i
did
care
glad
it
over
though
you
have
better
luck
next
pen
looked
at
his
early
acquaintance
who
had
been
plucked
who
had
been
rusticated
who
had
only
after
repeated
failures
learned
to
read
and
write
correctly
and
who
in
spite
of
all
these
drawbacks
had
attained
the
honour
of
a
degree
this
man
has
passed
he
thought
and
i
have
failed
it
was
almost
too
much
for
him
to
bear
spavin
said
he
i
very
glad

are
through

let
me
keep

i
in
a
hurry

and
a
coat
i
got
lots
come
along
jump
in
old
boy
go
it
leathers
and
in
this
way
pen
found
himself
in
spavin
postchaise
and
rode
with
that
gentleman
as
far
as
the
ram
inn
at
mudford
fifteen
miles
from
oxbridge
where
the
fenbury
mail
changed
horses
and
where
pen
got
a
place
on
to
london
the
next
day
there
was
an
immense
excitement
in
boniface
college
oxbridge
where
for
some
time
a
rumour
prevailed
to
the
terror
of
pen
tutor
and
tradesmen
that
pendennis
maddened
at
losing
his
degree
had
made
away
with
himself
a
battered
cap
in
which
his
name
was
almost
discernible
together
with
a
seal
bearing
his
crest
of
an
eagle
looking
at
a
now
extinct
sun
had
been
found
three
miles
on
the
fenbury
road
near
a
and
for
hours
it
was
supposed
that
poor
pen
had
flung
himself
into
the
stream
until
letters
arrived
from
him
bearing
the
london
the
mail
reached
london
at
the
dreary
hour
of
five
and
he
hastened
to
the
inn
at
covent
garden
at
which
he
was
accustomed
to
put
up
where
the
porter
admitted
him
and
showed
him
to
a
bed
pen
looked
hard
at
the
man
and
wondered
whether
boots
knew
he
was
plucked
when
in
bed
he
could
not
sleep
there
he
tossed
about
until
the
appearance
of
the
dismal
london
daylight
when
he
sprang
up
desperately
and
walked
off
to
his
uncle
lodgings
in
bury
street
where
the
maid
who
was
scouring
the
steps
looked
up
suspiciously
at
him
as
he
came
with
an
unshaven
face
and
yesterday
linen
he
thought
she
knew
of
his
mishap
too
good
harthur
what
as
sir
morgan
the
valet
asked
who
had
just
arranged
the
clothes
and
shiny
boots
at
the
door
of
his
master
bedroom
and
was
carrying
in
his
wig
to
the
major
i
want
to
see
my
uncle
he
cried
in
a
ghastly
voice
and
flung
himself
down
on
a
chair
morgan
backed
before
the
pale
and
young
man
with
terrified
and
wondering
glances
and
disappeared
in
his
apartment
the
major
put
his
head
out
of
the
bedroom
door
as
soon
as
he
had
his
wig
on
what
examination
over
senior
wrangler
double
first
class
hay
said
the
old
gentleman
i
come
directly
and
the
head
disappeared
they
do
know
what
has
happened
groaned
pen
what
will
they
say
when
they
know
all
pen
had
been
standing
with
his
back
to
the
window
and
to
such
a
dubious
light
as
bury
street
enjoys
of
a
foggy
january
morning
so
that
his
uncle
could
not
see
the
expression
of
the
young
man
countenance
or
the
looks
of
gloom
and
despair
which
even
morgan
had
remarked
but
when
the
major
came
out
of
his
neat
and
radiant
and
preceded
by
faint
odours
from
delcroix
shop
from
which
emporium
major
pendennis
wig
and
his
got
their
perfume
he
held
out
one
of
his
hands
to
pen
and
was
about
addressing
him
in
his
cheery
voice
when
he
caught
sight
of
the
boy
face
at
length
and
dropping
his
hand
said
good
god
pen
what
the
matter
you
see
it
in
the
papers
at
breakfast
sir
pen
said
see
what
my
name
is
there
hang
it
why
should
it
be
asked
the
major
more
perplexed
i
have
lost
everything
sir
pen
groaned
out
my
honour
gone
ruined
irretrievably
i
ca
go
back
to
lost
your
honour
screamed
out
the
major
heaven
alive
you
mean
to
say
you
have
shown
the
white
feather
pen
laughed
bitterly
at
the
word
feather
and
repeated
it
no
it
that
sir
i
not
afraid
of
being
shot
i
wish
to
god
anybody
would
i
have
not
got
my
degree
i
i
plucked
the
major
had
heard
of
plucking
but
in
a
very
vague
and
cursory
way
and
concluded
that
it
was
some
ceremony
performed
corporally
upon
rebellious
university
youth
i
wonder
you
can
look
me
in
the
face
after
such
a
disgrace
sir
he
said
i
wonder
you
submitted
to
it
as
a
i
could
help
it
sir
i
did
my
classical
papers
well
enough
it
was
those
infernal
mathematics
which
i
have
always
was
it
was
it
done
in
public
sir
the
major
said
what
the
the
plucking
asked
the
guardian
looking
pen
anxiously
in
the
face
pen
perceived
the
error
under
which
his
guardian
was
labouring
and
in
the
midst
of
his
misery
the
blunder
caused
the
poor
wretch
a
faint
smile
and
served
to
bring
down
the
conversation
from
the
in
which
pen
had
been
disposed
to
carry
it
on
he
explained
to
his
uncle
that
he
had
gone
in
to
pass
his
examination
and
failed
on
which
the
major
said
that
though
he
had
expected
far
better
things
of
his
nephew
there
was
no
great
misfortune
in
this
and
no
dishonour
as
far
as
he
saw
and
that
pen
must
try
again
me
again
at
oxbridge
pen
thought
after
such
a
humiliation
as
that
he
felt
that
except
he
went
down
to
burn
the
place
he
could
not
enter
it
but
it
was
when
he
came
to
tell
his
uncle
of
his
debts
that
the
other
felt
surprise
and
anger
most
keenly
and
broke
out
in
speeches
most
severe
upon
pen
which
the
lad
bore
as
best
might
without
flinching
he
had
determined
to
make
a
clean
breast
and
had
formed
a
full
true
and
complete
list
of
all
his
bills
and
liabilities
at
the
university
and
in
london
they
consisted
of
various
items
such
as
london
tailor
oxbridge
do
oxbridge
do
bill
for
horses
haberdasher
for
shirts
and
gloves
printseller
jeweller
books
college
cook
binding
grump
for
desserts
hairdresser
and
perfumery
bootmaker
hotel
bill
in
london
wine
merchant
in
london
sundries
all
which
items
the
reader
may
fill
in
at
his
pleasure
such
accounts
have
been
inspected
by
the
parents
of
many
university
youth
and
it
appeared
that
mr
pen
bills
in
all
amounted
to
about
seven
hundred
pounds
and
furthermore
it
was
calculated
that
he
had
had
more
than
twice
that
sum
of
ready
money
during
his
stay
at
oxbridge
this
sum
he
had
spent
and
for
it
had
to
show
what
you
need
not
press
a
man
who
is
down
sir
pen
said
to
his
uncle
gloomily
i
know
very
well
sir
how
wicked
and
idle
i
have
been
my
mother
wo
like
to
see
me
dishonoured
sir
he
continued
with
his
voice
failing
and
i
know
she
will
pay
these
accounts
but
i
shall
ask
her
for
no
more
as
you
like
sir
the
major
said
you
are
of
age
and
my
hands
are
washed
of
your
affairs
but
you
ca
live
without
money
and
have
no
means
of
making
it
that
i
see
though
you
have
a
fine
talent
in
spending
it
and
it
is
my
belief
that
you
will
proceed
as
you
have
begun
and
ruin
your
mother
before
you
are
five
years
good
morning
it
is
time
for
me
to
go
to
breakfast
my
engagements
wo
permit
me
to
see
you
much
during
the
time
that
you
stay
in
london
i
presume
that
you
will
acquaint
your
mother
with
the
news
which
you
have
just
conveyed
to
and
pulling
on
his
hat
and
trembling
in
his
limbs
somewhat
major
pendennis
walked
out
of
his
lodgings
before
his
nephew
and
went
ruefully
off
to
take
his
accustomed
corner
at
the
club
he
saw
the
oxbridge
in
the
morning
papers
and
read
over
the
names
not
understanding
the
business
with
mournful
accuracy
he
consulted
various
old
fogies
of
his
acquaintance
in
the
course
of
the
day
at
his
clubs
wenham
a
dean
various
civilians
and
as
it
is
called
took
their
opinion
showing
to
some
of
them
the
amount
of
his
nephew
debts
which
he
had
dotted
down
on
the
back
of
a
card
and
asking
what
was
to
be
done
and
whether
such
debts
were
not
monstrous
preposterous
what
was
to
be
done
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
pay
wenham
and
the
others
told
the
major
of
young
men
who
owed
twice
as
much
five
times
as
much
as
arthur
and
with
no
means
at
all
to
pay
the
consultations
and
calculations
and
opinions
comforted
the
major
somewhat
after
all
he
was
not
to
pay
but
he
thought
bitterly
of
the
many
plans
he
had
formed
to
make
a
man
of
his
nephew
of
the
sacrifices
which
he
had
made
and
of
the
manner
in
which
he
was
disappointed
and
he
wrote
off
a
letter
to
doctor
portman
informing
him
of
the
direful
events
which
had
taken
place
and
begging
the
doctor
to
break
them
to
helen
for
the
orthodox
old
gentleman
preserved
the
regular
routine
in
all
things
and
was
of
opinion
that
it
was
more
correct
to
break
a
piece
of
bad
news
to
a
person
by
means
of
a
possibly
maladroit
and
unfeeling
messenger
than
to
convey
it
simply
to
its
destination
by
a
note
so
the
major
wrote
to
doctor
portman
and
then
went
out
to
dinner
one
of
the
saddest
men
in
any
london
that
day
pen
too
wrote
his
letter
and
skulked
about
london
streets
for
the
rest
of
the
day
fancying
that
everybody
was
looking
at
him
and
whispering
to
his
neighbour
that
is
pendennis
of
boniface
who
was
plucked
his
letter
to
his
mother
was
full
of
tenderness
and
remorse
he
wept
the
bitterest
tears
over
it
and
the
repentance
and
passion
soothed
him
to
some
degree
he
saw
a
party
of
roaring
young
blades
from
oxbridge
in
the
of
his
hotel
and
slunk
away
from
them
and
paced
the
streets
he
remembers
he
says
the
prints
which
he
saw
hanging
up
at
window
in
the
rain
and
a
book
which
he
read
at
a
stall
near
the
temple
at
night
he
went
to
the
pit
of
the
play
and
saw
miss
fotheringay
but
he
does
in
the
least
recollect
in
what
piece
on
the
second
day
there
came
a
kind
letter
from
his
tutor
containing
many
grave
and
appropriate
remarks
upon
the
event
which
had
befallen
him
but
strongly
urging
pen
not
to
take
his
name
off
the
university
books
and
to
retrieve
a
disaster
which
everybody
knew
was
owing
to
his
own
carelessness
alone
and
which
he
might
repair
by
a
application
he
said
he
had
ordered
pen
skip
to
pack
up
some
trunks
of
the
young
gentleman
wardrobe
which
duly
arrived
with
fresh
copies
of
all
pen
bills
laid
on
the
top
on
the
third
day
there
arrived
a
letter
from
home
which
pen
read
in
his
bedroom
and
the
result
of
which
was
that
he
fell
down
on
his
knees
with
his
head
in
the
bedclothes
and
then
prayed
out
his
heart
and
humbled
himself
and
having
gone
downstairs
and
eaten
an
immense
breakfast
he
sallied
forth
and
took
his
place
at
the
bull
and
mouth
piccadilly
by
the
chatteris
coach
for
that
evening
chapter
xxii
prodigal
return
such
a
letter
as
the
major
wrote
of
course
sent
doctor
portman
to
fairoaks
and
he
went
off
with
that
alacrity
which
a
good
man
shows
when
he
has
disagreeable
news
to
communicate
he
wishes
the
deed
were
done
and
done
quickly
he
is
sorry
but
que
the
tooth
must
be
taken
out
and
he
has
you
in
the
chair
and
it
is
surprising
with
what
courage
and
vigour
of
wrist
he
applies
the
forceps
perhaps
he
would
not
be
quite
so
active
or
eager
if
it
were
his
tooth
but
in
fine
it
is
your
duty
to
have
it
out
so
the
doctor
having
read
the
epistle
out
to
myra
and
portman
with
many
damnatory
comments
upon
the
young
scapegrace
who
was
going
deeper
and
deeper
into
perdition
left
those
ladies
to
spread
the
news
through
the
clavering
society
which
they
did
with
their
accustomed
accuracy
and
despatch
and
strode
over
to
fairoaks
to
break
the
intelligence
to
the
widow
she
had
the
news
already
she
had
read
pen
letter
and
it
had
relieved
her
somehow
a
gloomy
presentiment
of
evil
had
been
hanging
over
her
for
many
many
months
past
she
knew
the
worst
now
and
her
darling
boy
was
come
back
to
her
repentant
and
did
she
want
more
all
that
the
rector
could
say
and
his
remarks
were
both
dictated
by
and
made
respectable
by
antiquity
could
not
bring
helen
to
feel
any
indignation
or
particular
unhappiness
except
that
the
boy
should
be
unhappy
what
was
this
degree
that
they
made
such
an
outcry
about
and
what
good
would
it
do
pen
why
did
doctor
portman
and
his
uncle
insist
upon
sending
the
boy
to
a
place
where
there
was
so
much
temptation
to
be
risked
and
so
little
good
to
be
won
why
did
they
leave
him
at
home
with
his
mother
as
for
his
debts
of
course
they
must
be
paid
his
debts
was
his
father
money
all
his
and
had
he
a
right
to
spend
it
in
this
way
the
widow
met
the
virtuous
doctor
and
all
the
arrows
of
his
indignation
somehow
took
no
effect
upon
her
gentle
bosom
for
some
time
past
an
agreeable
practice
known
since
times
ever
so
ancient
by
which
brothers
and
sisters
are
wont
to
exhibit
their
affection
towards
one
another
and
in
which
pen
and
his
little
sister
laura
had
been
accustomed
to
indulge
pretty
frequently
in
their
childish
days
had
been
given
up
by
the
mutual
consent
of
those
two
individuals
coming
back
from
college
after
an
absence
from
home
of
some
months
in
place
of
the
simple
girl
whom
he
had
left
behind
him
arthur
found
a
tall
slim
handsome
young
lady
to
whom
he
could
not
somehow
proffer
the
kiss
which
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
administering
previously
and
who
received
him
with
a
gracious
curtsey
and
a
proffered
hand
and
with
a
great
blush
which
rose
up
to
the
cheek
just
upon
the
very
spot
which
young
pen
had
been
used
to
salute
i
am
not
good
at
descriptions
of
female
beauty
and
indeed
do
not
care
for
it
in
the
least
thinking
that
goodness
and
virtue
are
of
course
far
more
advantageous
to
a
young
lady
than
any
mere
fleeting
charms
of
person
and
face
and
so
shall
not
attempt
any
particular
delineation
of
miss
laura
bell
at
the
age
of
sixteen
years
at
that
age
she
had
attained
her
present
altitude
of
five
feet
four
inches
so
that
she
was
called
tall
and
gawky
by
some
and
a
maypole
by
others
of
her
own
sex
who
prefer
littler
women
but
if
she
was
a
maypole
she
had
beautiful
roses
about
her
head
and
it
is
a
fact
that
many
swains
were
disposed
to
dance
round
her
she
was
ordinarily
pale
with
a
faint
rose
tinge
in
her
cheeks
but
they
flushed
up
in
a
minute
when
occasion
called
and
continued
so
blushing
ever
so
long
the
roses
remaining
after
the
emotion
had
passed
away
which
had
summoned
those
pretty
flowers
into
existence
her
eyes
have
been
described
as
very
large
from
her
earliest
childhood
and
retained
that
characteristic
in
later
life
critics
always
females
said
that
she
was
in
the
habit
of
making
play
with
those
eyes
and
ogling
the
gentlemen
and
ladies
in
her
company
but
the
fact
is
that
nature
had
made
them
so
to
shine
and
to
look
and
they
could
no
more
help
so
looking
and
shining
than
one
star
can
help
being
brighter
than
another
it
was
doubtless
to
mitigate
their
brightness
that
miss
laura
eyes
were
provided
with
two
pairs
of
veils
in
the
shape
of
the
longest
and
finest
black
eyelashes
so
that
when
she
closed
her
eyes
the
same
people
who
found
fault
with
those
orbs
said
that
she
wanted
to
show
her
eyelashes
off
and
indeed
i
daresay
that
to
see
her
asleep
would
have
been
a
pretty
sight
as
for
her
complexion
that
was
nearly
as
brilliant
as
lady
mantrap
and
without
the
powder
which
her
ladyship
uses
her
nose
must
be
left
to
the
reader
imaginaton
if
her
mouth
was
rather
large
as
miss
piminy
avers
who
but
for
her
known
appetite
one
would
think
could
not
swallow
anything
larger
than
a
button
everybody
allowed
that
her
smile
was
charming
and
showed
off
a
set
of
pearly
teeth
whilst
her
voice
was
so
low
and
sweet
that
to
hear
it
was
like
listening
to
sweet
music
because
she
is
in
the
habit
of
wearing
very
long
dresses
people
of
course
say
that
her
feet
are
not
small
but
it
may
be
that
they
are
of
the
size
becoming
her
figure
and
it
does
not
follow
because
pincher
is
always
putting
her
foot
out
that
all
other
ladies
should
be
perpetually
bringing
theirs
on
the
tapis
in
fine
miss
laura
bell
at
the
age
of
sixteen
was
a
sweet
young
lady
many
thousands
of
such
are
to
be
found
let
us
hope
in
this
country
where
there
is
no
lack
of
goodness
and
modesty
and
purity
and
beauty
now
miss
laura
since
she
had
learned
to
think
for
herself
and
in
the
past
two
years
her
mind
and
her
person
had
both
developed
themselves
considerably
had
only
been
half
pleased
with
pen
general
conduct
and
bearing
his
letters
to
his
mother
at
home
had
become
of
late
very
rare
and
short
it
was
in
vain
that
the
fond
widow
urged
how
constant
arthur
occupations
and
studies
were
and
how
many
his
engagements
it
is
better
that
he
should
lose
a
prize
laura
said
than
forget
his
mother
and
indeed
mamma
i
do
see
that
he
gets
many
prizes
why
does
he
come
home
and
stay
with
you
instead
of
passing
his
vacations
at
his
great
friends
fine
houses
there
is
nobody
there
will
love
him
half
so
much
as
as
you
as
i
do
only
laura
sighed
out
pendennis
laura
declared
stoutly
that
she
did
not
love
pen
a
bit
when
he
did
not
do
his
duty
to
his
mother
nor
would
she
be
convinced
by
any
of
helen
fond
arguments
that
the
boy
must
make
his
way
in
the
world
that
his
uncle
was
most
desirous
that
pen
should
cultivate
the
acquaintance
of
persons
who
were
likely
to
befriend
him
in
life
that
men
had
a
thousand
ties
and
calls
which
women
could
not
understand
and
so
forth
perhaps
helen
no
more
believed
in
these
excuses
than
her
adopted
daughter
did
but
she
tried
to
believe
that
she
believed
them
and
comforted
herself
with
the
maternal
infatuation
and
that
is
a
point
whereon
i
suppose
many
a
gentleman
has
reflected
that
do
what
we
will
we
are
pretty
sure
of
the
woman
love
that
once
has
been
ours
and
that
that
untiring
tenderness
and
forgiveness
never
fail
us
also
there
had
been
that
freedom
not
to
say
audacity
in
latter
talk
and
ways
which
had
shocked
and
displeased
laura
not
that
he
ever
offended
her
by
rudeness
or
addressed
to
her
a
word
which
she
ought
not
to
hear
for
mr
pen
was
a
gentleman
and
by
nature
and
education
polite
to
every
woman
high
and
low
but
he
spoke
lightly
and
laxly
of
women
in
general
was
less
courteous
in
his
actions
than
in
his
words
neglectful
in
sundry
ways
and
in
many
of
the
little
offices
of
life
it
offended
miss
laura
that
he
should
smoke
his
horrid
pipes
in
the
house
that
he
should
refuse
to
go
to
church
with
his
mother
or
on
walks
or
visits
with
her
and
be
found
yawning
over
his
novel
in
his
when
the
gentle
widow
returned
from
those
duties
the
hero
of
laura
early
infancy
about
whom
she
had
passed
so
many
many
nights
talking
with
helen
who
recited
endless
stories
of
the
virtues
and
love
and
bravery
when
he
was
away
at
school
was
a
very
different
person
from
the
young
man
whom
now
she
knew
bold
and
brilliant
sarcastic
and
defiant
seeming
to
scorn
the
simple
occupations
or
pleasures
or
even
devotions
of
the
women
with
whom
he
lived
and
whom
he
quitted
on
such
light
pretexts
the
fotheringay
affair
too
when
laura
came
to
hear
of
it
which
she
did
first
by
some
sarcastic
allusions
of
major
pendennis
when
on
a
visit
to
fairoaks
and
then
from
their
neighbours
at
clavering
who
had
plenty
of
information
to
give
her
on
this
head
vastly
shocked
and
outraged
miss
laura
a
pendennis
fling
himself
away
on
such
a
woman
as
that
helen
boy
galloping
away
from
home
day
after
day
to
fall
on
his
knees
to
an
actress
and
drink
with
her
horrid
father
a
good
son
want
to
bring
such
a
man
and
such
a
woman
into
his
house
and
set
her
over
his
mother
i
would
have
run
away
mamma
i
would
if
i
had
had
to
walk
barefoot
through
the
snow
laura
said
and
you
would
have
left
me
too
then
helen
answered
on
which
of
course
laura
withdrew
her
previous
observation
and
the
two
women
rushed
into
each
other
embraces
with
that
warmth
which
belonged
to
both
their
natures
and
which
characterises
not
a
few
of
their
sex
whence
came
all
the
indignation
of
miss
laura
about
arthur
passion
perhaps
she
did
not
know
that
if
men
throw
themselves
away
upon
women
women
throw
themselves
away
upon
men
too
and
that
there
is
no
more
accounting
for
love
than
for
any
other
physical
liking
or
antipathy
perhaps
she
had
been
misinformed
by
the
clavering
people
and
old
portman
who
was
vastly
bitter
against
pen
especially
since
his
impertinent
behaviour
to
the
doctor
and
since
the
wretch
had
smoked
cigars
in
perhaps
finally
she
was
jealous
but
this
is
a
vice
in
which
it
is
said
the
ladies
very
seldom
indulge
albeit
she
was
angry
with
pen
against
his
mother
she
had
no
such
feeling
but
devoted
herself
to
helen
with
the
utmost
force
of
her
girlish
affection
such
affection
as
women
whose
hearts
are
disengaged
are
apt
to
bestow
upon
the
near
female
friend
it
was
devotion
it
was
passion
it
was
all
sorts
of
fondness
and
folly
it
was
a
profusion
of
caresses
tender
epithets
and
endearments
such
as
it
does
not
become
sober
historians
with
beards
to
narrate
do
not
let
us
men
despise
these
instincts
because
we
can
not
feel
them
these
women
were
made
for
our
comfort
and
delectation
gentlemen
with
all
the
rest
of
the
minor
animals
but
as
soon
as
miss
laura
heard
that
pen
was
unfortunate
and
unhappy
all
her
wrath
against
him
straightway
vanished
and
gave
place
to
the
most
tender
and
unreasonable
compassion
he
was
the
pen
of
old
days
once
more
restored
to
her
the
frank
and
affectionate
the
generous
and
she
at
once
took
side
with
helen
against
doctor
portman
when
he
outcried
at
the
enormity
of
pen
transgressions
debts
what
were
his
debts
they
were
a
trifle
he
had
been
thrown
into
expensive
society
by
his
uncle
order
and
of
course
was
obliged
to
live
in
the
same
manner
as
the
young
gentlemen
whose
company
he
frequented
disgraced
by
not
getting
his
degree
the
poor
boy
was
ill
when
he
went
in
for
the
examinations
he
could
think
of
his
mathematics
and
stuff
on
account
of
those
very
debts
which
oppressed
him
very
likely
some
of
the
odious
tutors
and
masters
were
jealous
of
him
and
had
favourites
of
their
own
whom
they
wanted
to
put
over
his
head
other
people
disliked
him
and
were
cruel
to
him
and
were
unfair
to
him
she
was
very
sure
and
so
with
flushing
cheeks
and
eyes
bright
with
anger
this
young
creature
reasoned
and
she
went
up
and
seized
helen
hand
and
kissed
her
in
the
doctor
presence
and
her
looks
braved
the
doctor
and
seemed
to
ask
how
he
dared
to
say
a
word
against
her
darling
pen
when
that
divine
took
his
leave
not
a
little
discomfited
and
amazed
at
the
pertinacious
obstinacy
of
the
women
laura
repeated
her
embraces
and
arguments
with
tenfold
fervour
to
helen
who
felt
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
cogency
in
most
of
the
latter
there
must
be
some
jealousy
against
pen
she
felt
quite
sure
that
he
had
offended
some
of
the
examiners
who
had
taken
a
mean
revenge
of
him
nothing
more
likely
altogether
the
announcement
of
the
misfortune
vexed
these
two
ladies
very
little
indeed
pen
who
was
plunged
in
his
shame
and
grief
in
london
and
torn
with
great
remorse
for
thinking
of
his
mother
sorrow
would
have
wondered
had
he
seen
how
easily
she
bore
the
calamity
indeed
calamity
is
welcome
to
women
if
they
think
it
will
bring
truant
affection
home
again
and
if
you
have
reduced
your
mistress
to
a
crust
depend
upon
it
that
she
wo
repine
and
only
take
a
very
little
bit
of
it
for
herself
provided
you
will
eat
the
remainder
in
her
company
and
directly
the
doctor
was
gone
laura
ordered
fires
to
be
lighted
in
arthur
rooms
and
his
bedding
to
be
aired
and
had
these
preparations
completed
by
the
time
helen
had
finished
a
most
tender
and
affectionate
letter
to
pen
when
the
girl
smiling
fondly
took
her
mamma
by
the
hand
and
led
her
into
those
apartments
where
the
fires
were
blazing
so
cheerfully
and
there
the
two
kind
creatures
sate
down
on
the
bed
and
talked
about
pen
ever
so
long
laura
added
a
postscript
to
helen
letter
in
which
she
called
him
her
dearest
pen
and
bade
him
come
home
instantly
with
two
of
the
handsomest
dashes
under
the
word
and
be
happy
with
his
mother
and
his
affectionate
sister
laura
in
the
middle
of
the
night
as
these
two
ladies
after
reading
their
bibles
a
great
deal
during
the
evening
and
after
taking
just
a
look
into
pen
room
as
they
passed
to
their
own
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
say
laura
whose
head
not
unfrequently
chose
to
occupy
that
pillow
which
the
nightcap
of
the
late
pendennis
had
been
accustomed
to
press
cried
out
suddenly
mamma
are
you
awake
helen
stirred
and
said
yes
i
the
truth
is
though
she
had
been
lying
quite
still
and
silent
she
had
not
been
asleep
one
instant
but
had
been
looking
at
the
in
the
chimney
and
had
been
thinking
of
pen
for
hours
and
hours
then
miss
laura
who
had
been
acting
with
similar
hypocrisy
and
lying
occupied
with
her
own
thoughts
as
motionless
as
helen
brooch
with
pen
and
laura
hair
in
it
on
the
frilled
white
pincushion
on
the
began
to
tell
pendennis
of
a
notable
plan
which
she
had
been
forming
in
her
busy
little
brains
and
by
which
all
embarrassments
would
be
made
to
vanish
in
a
moment
and
without
the
least
trouble
to
anybody
you
know
mamma
this
young
lady
said
that
i
have
been
living
with
you
for
ten
years
during
which
time
you
have
never
taken
any
of
my
money
and
have
been
treating
me
just
as
if
i
was
a
charity
girl
now
this
obligation
has
offended
me
very
much
because
i
am
proud
and
do
not
like
to
be
beholden
to
people
and
as
if
i
had
gone
to
school
only
i
would
it
must
have
cost
me
at
least
fifty
pounds
a
year
it
is
clear
that
i
owe
you
fifty
times
ten
pounds
which
i
know
you
have
put
in
the
bank
at
chatteris
for
me
and
which
does
belong
to
me
a
bit
now
we
will
go
to
chatteris
and
see
that
nice
old
rowdy
with
the
bald
head
and
ask
him
for
it
not
for
his
head
but
for
the
five
hundred
pounds
and
i
dare
say
he
will
send
you
two
more
which
we
will
save
and
pay
back
and
we
will
send
the
money
to
pen
who
can
pay
all
his
debts
without
hurting
anybody
and
then
we
will
live
happy
ever
what
helen
replied
to
this
speech
need
not
be
repeated
as
the
answer
was
made
up
of
a
great
number
of
incoherent
ejaculations
embraces
and
other
irrelative
matter
but
the
two
women
slept
well
after
that
talk
and
when
the
went
out
with
a
splutter
and
the
sun
rose
gloriously
over
the
purple
hills
and
the
birds
began
to
sing
and
pipe
cheerfully
amidst
the
leafless
trees
and
glistening
evergreens
on
fairoaks
lawn
helen
woke
too
and
as
she
looked
at
the
sweet
face
of
the
girl
sleeping
beside
her
her
lips
parted
with
a
smile
blushes
on
her
cheeks
her
spotless
bosom
heaving
and
falling
with
gentle
undulations
as
if
happy
dreams
were
sweeping
over
it
mother
felt
happy
and
grateful
beyond
all
power
of
words
save
such
as
pious
women
offer
up
to
the
beneficent
dispenser
of
love
and
mercy
in
whose
honour
a
chorus
of
such
praises
is
constantly
rising
up
all
round
the
world
although
it
was
january
and
rather
cold
weather
so
sincere
was
mr
pen
remorse
and
so
determined
his
plans
of
economy
that
he
would
not
take
an
inside
place
in
the
coach
but
sate
up
behind
with
his
friend
the
guard
who
remembered
his
former
liberality
and
lent
him
plenty
of
perhaps
it
was
the
cold
that
made
his
knees
tremble
as
he
got
down
at
the
or
it
may
be
that
he
was
agitated
at
the
notion
of
seeing
the
kind
creature
for
whose
love
he
had
made
so
selfish
a
return
old
john
was
in
waiting
to
receive
his
master
baggage
but
he
appeared
in
a
fustian
jacket
and
no
longer
wore
his
livery
of
drab
and
blue
garner
and
stable
man
and
lives
in
the
ladge
now
this
worthy
man
remarked
with
a
grin
of
welcome
to
pen
and
something
of
a
blush
but
instantly
as
pen
turned
the
corner
of
the
shrubbery
and
was
out
of
of
the
coach
helen
made
her
appearance
her
face
beaming
with
love
and
forgiveness
for
forgiving
is
what
some
women
love
best
of
all
we
may
be
sure
that
the
widow
having
a
certain
other
object
in
view
had
lost
no
time
in
writing
off
to
pen
an
account
of
the
noble
the
magnanimous
the
magnificent
offer
of
laura
filling
up
her
letter
with
a
profusion
of
benedictions
upon
both
her
children
it
was
probably
the
knowledge
of
this
which
caused
pen
to
blush
very
much
when
he
saw
laura
who
was
in
waiting
in
the
hall
and
who
this
time
and
for
this
time
only
broke
through
the
little
arrangement
of
which
we
have
spoken
as
having
subsisted
between
her
and
arthur
for
the
last
few
years
but
the
truth
is
there
has
been
a
great
deal
too
much
said
about
kissing
in
the
present
chapter
so
the
prodigal
came
home
and
the
fatted
calf
was
killed
for
him
and
he
was
made
as
happy
as
two
simple
women
could
make
him
no
allusions
were
made
to
the
oxbridge
mishap
or
questions
asked
as
to
his
farther
proceedings
for
some
time
but
pen
debated
these
anxiously
in
his
own
mind
and
up
in
his
own
room
where
he
passed
much
time
in
cogitation
a
few
days
after
he
came
home
he
rode
to
chatteris
on
his
horse
and
came
back
on
the
top
of
the
coach
he
then
informed
his
mother
that
he
had
left
the
horse
to
be
sold
and
when
that
operation
was
effected
he
handed
her
over
the
cheque
which
she
and
possibly
pen
himself
thought
was
an
act
of
uncommon
virtue
and
but
which
laura
pronounced
to
be
only
strict
justice
he
rarely
mentioned
the
loan
which
she
had
made
and
which
indeed
had
been
accepted
by
the
widow
with
certain
modifications
but
once
or
twice
and
with
great
hesitation
and
stammering
he
alluded
to
it
and
thanked
her
but
it
evidently
pained
his
vanity
to
be
beholden
to
the
orphan
for
succour
he
was
wild
to
find
some
means
of
repaying
her
he
left
off
drinking
wine
and
betook
himself
but
with
great
moderation
to
the
refreshment
of
he
gave
up
but
it
must
be
confessed
that
of
late
years
he
had
liked
pipes
and
tobacco
as
well
or
even
better
so
that
this
sacrifice
was
not
a
very
severe
one
he
fell
asleep
a
great
deal
after
dinner
when
he
joined
the
ladies
in
the
and
was
certainly
very
moody
and
melancholy
he
watched
the
coaches
with
great
interest
walked
in
to
read
the
papers
at
clavering
assiduously
dined
with
anybody
who
would
ask
him
and
the
widow
was
glad
that
he
should
have
any
entertainment
in
their
solitary
place
and
played
a
good
deal
at
cribbage
with
captain
glanders
he
avoided
portman
who
in
his
turn
whenever
pen
passed
gave
him
very
severe
looks
from
under
his
he
went
to
church
with
his
mother
however
very
regularly
and
read
prayers
for
her

on

induce
him
to
go

after

one
day
laura
said
to
him
with
many
blushes
that
she
thought
as
some
sort
of
reparation
of
punishment
on
himself

in
the
county
was
that
clavering
who
had
been
ruined
for
many
a
year
had
married
a
widow
from
india
with
some
money
some
of
the
county
folks
caught
a
sight
of
the
pair
the
kickleburys
travelling
in
italy
had
seen
them
clavering
occupied
the
poggi
palace
at
florence
gave
parties
and
lived
comfortably
but
could
never
come
to
england
another
year
young
peregrine
of
cackleby
making
a
long
vacation
tour
had
fallen
in
with
the
claverings
occupying
schloss
schinkenstein
on
the
mummel
see
at
rome
at
lucca
at
nice
at
the
baths
and
gambling
places
of
the
rhine
and
belgium
this
worthy
couple
might
occasionally
be
heard
of
by
the
curious
and
rumours
of
them
came
as
it
were
by
gusts
to
ancestral
place
their
last
place
of
abode
was
paris
where
they
appear
to
have
lived
in
great
fashion
and
splendour
after
the
news
of
the
death
of
samuel
snell
of
calcutta
reached
his
orphan
daughter
in
europe
of
sir
francis
clavering
antecedents
little
can
be
said
that
would
be
advantageous
to
that
respected
baronet
the
son
of
an
outlaw
living
in
a
dismal
old
chateau
near
bruges
this
gentleman
had
made
a
feeble
attempt
to
start
in
life
with
a
commission
in
a
dragoon
regiment
and
had
broken
down
almost
at
the
outset
transactions
at
the

speedily
effected
his
ruin
after
a
couple
of
years
in
the
army
he
had
been
forced
to
sell
out
had
passed
some
time
in
her
prison
of
the
fleet
and
had
then
shipped
over
to
ostend
to
join
the
gouty
exile
his
father
and
in
belgium
france
and
germany
for
some
years
this
decayed
and
abortive
prodigal
might
be
seen
lurking
about
and
punting
at
dancing
at
balls
and
riding
on
other
horses
it
was
at
a
at
lausanne
that
francis
clavering
made
what
he
called
the
lucky
coup
of
marrying
the
widow
amory
very
lately
returned
from
calcutta
his
father
died
soon
after
by
consequence
of
whose
demise
his
wife
became
lady
clavering
the
title
so
delighted
snell
of
calcutta
that
he
doubled
his
daughter
allowance
and
dying
himself
soon
after
left
a
fortune
to
her
and
her
children
the
amount
of
which
was
if
not
magnified
by
rumour
something
very
splendid
indeed
before
this
time
there
had
been
not
rumours
unfavourable
to
lady
clavering
reputation
but
unpleasant
impressions
regarding
her
ladyship
the
best
english
people
abroad
were
shy
of
making
her
acquaintance
her
manners
were
not
the
most
refined
her
origin
was
lamentably
low
and
doubtful
the
retired
east
indians
who
are
to
be
found
in
considerable
force
in
most
of
the
continental
towns
frequented
by
english
spoke
with
much
scorn
of
the
disreputable
old
lawyer
and
her
father
and
of
amory
her
first
husband
who
had
been
mate
of
the
indiaman
in
which
miss
snell
came
out
to
join
her
father
at
calcutta
neither
father
nor
daughter
were
in
society
at
calcutta
or
had
ever
been
heard
of
at
government
house
old
sir
jasper
rogers
who
had
been
chief
justice
of
calcutta
had
once
said
to
his
wife
that
he
could
tell
a
queer
story
about
lady
clavering
first
husband
but
greatly
to
lady
rogers
disappointment
and
that
of
the
young
ladies
his
daughters
the
old
judge
could
never
be
got
to
reveal
that
mystery
they
were
all
however
glad
enough
to
go
to
lady
clavering
parties
when
her
ladyship
took
the
hotel
bouilli
in
the
rue
grenelle
at
paris
and
blazed
out
in
the
polite
world
there
in
the
winter
of
the
faubourg

took
her
up
viscount

our
excellent
ambassador

her
marked
attention
the

of

her
salons
the
most
rigid
and
noted
of
the
english
ladies
resident
in
the
french
capital
acknowledged
and
countenanced
her
the
virtuous
lady
elderbury
the
severe
lady
rockminster
the
venerable
countess
of
southdown
people
in
a
word
renowned
for
austerity
and
of
quite
a
dazzling
moral
purity
so
great
and
beneficent
an
influence
had
the
possession
of
ten
some
said
twenty
thousand
a
year
exercised
upon
lady
clavering
character
and
reputation
and
her
munificence
and
were
unbounded
anybody
in
society
who
had
a
scheme
of
charity
was
sure
to
find
her
purse
open
the
french
ladies
of
piety
got
money
from
her
to
support
their
schools
and
convents
she
subscribed
indifferently
for
the
armenian
patriarch

barbarossa
who
came
to
europe
to
collect
funds
for

largest
and
most
savage
of
the

and
it
is
on
record
of
her
that
on
the
same
day
on
which
madame
de
cricri
got
five
napoleons
from
her
in
support
of
the
poor
persecuted
jesuits
who
were
at
that
time
in
very
bad
odour
in
france
lady
budelight
put
her
down
in
her
for
the
rev
ramshorn
who
had
had
a
vision
which
ordered
him
to
convert
the
pope
of
rome
and
more
than
this
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
worldly
her
ladyship
gave
the
best
dinners
and
the
grandest
balls
and
suppers
which
were
known
at
paris
during
that
season
and
it
was
during
this
time
that
the
lady
must
have
arranged
matters
with
her
husband
creditors
in
england
for
sir
francis
reappeared
in

native
country
without
fear
of
arrest

announced
in
the
morning
post
and
the
county
paper
as
having
taken
up
his
residence
at
mivart
hotel
and
one
day
the
anxious
old
housekeeper
at
clavering
house
beheld
a
carriage
and
four
horses
drive
up
the
long
avenue
and
stop
before
the

of
the
vast
melancholy
portico
three
gentlemen
were
in

on
the
back
seat

our
old
acquaintance

whilst
in
the
places
of
honour
sate
a
handsome
and
portly
gentleman
enveloped
in
mustachios
whiskers
fur
collars
and
braiding
and
by
him
a
pale
languid
man
who
descended
feebly
from
the
carriage
when
the
little
lawyer
and
the
gentleman
in
fur
nimbly
jumped
out
of
it
they
walked
up
the
great
steps
to
the
and
a
foreign
attendant
with
earrings
and
a
cap
pulled
strenuously
at
the
great
at
the
cracked
and
sculptured
gate
the
bell
was
heard
clanging
loudly
through
the
vast
gloomy
mansion
steps
resounded
presently
upon
the
marble
pavement
of
the
hall
within
and
the
doors
opened
and
finally
blenkinsop
the
housekeeper
polly
her
and

the
keeper
appeared
bowing
humbly

the
keeper
pulled
the
wisp
of
hair
which
adorned
his
sunburnt
forehead
kicked
out
his
left
heel
as
if
there
were
a
dog
biting
at
his
calves
and
brought
down
his
head
to
a
bow
old
mrs

dropped
a
curtsey
little
polly

a
curtsey

of

the
speech

the
greetings

all
addressed
to
the
grand
gentleman
in
fur
and
braiding
who
wore
his
hat
so
magnificently
on
one
side
and
twirled
his
mustachios
so
royally
but
he
burst
out
laughing
and
said

he
took
the
old
trembling

and
nodded

her
astonished
face
in
a
not
unkind
manner
blenkinsop
declared
upon
her
conscience
that
she
would
have
known
sir

of

for
such
was
the
style
and
title
of
sir
francis
friend
passed
out
of
the
hall
into
the
leaving
the
discomfited
blenkinsop
to
disappear
by
a
which
led
to
her
apartments
now
the
only
habitable
rooms
in
the
mansion
it
was
a
place
so
big
that
no
tenant
could
afford
to
live
in
it
and
sir
francis
and
his
friend
walked
through
room
after
room
admiring
their
vastness
and
dreary
and
deserted
grandeur
on
the
right
of
the
were
the
saloons
and
and
on
the
other
side
the
oak
room
the
parlour
the
grand
the
library
where
pen
had
found
books
in
old
days
round
three
sides
of
the
hall
ran
a
gallery
by
which
and
corresponding
passages
the
chief
bedrooms
were
approached
and
of
which
many
were
of
stately
proportions
and
exhibited
marks
of
splendour
on
the
second
story
was
a
labyrinth
of
little
discomfortable
garrets
destined
for
the
attendants
of
the
great
folks
who
inhabited
the
mansion
in
the
days
when
it
was
first
built
and
i
do
not
know
any
more
cheering
mark
of
the
increased
philanthropy
of
our
own
times
than
to
contrast
our
domestic
architecture
with
that
of
our
ancestors
and
to
see
how
much
better
servants
and
poor
are
cared
for
now
than
in
times
when
my
lord
and
my
lady
slept
under
gold
canopies
and
their
servants
lay
above
them
in
quarters
not
so
airy
or
so
clean
as
stables
are
now
up
and
down
the
house
the
two
gentlemen
wandered
the
owner
of
the
mansion
being
very
silent
and
resigned
about
the
pleasure
of
possessing
it
whereas
the
captain
his
friend
examined
the
premises
with
so
much
interest
and
eagerness
that
you
would
have
thought
he
was
the
master
and
the
other
the
indifferent
spectator
of
the
place
i
see
capabilities

it

cried
the
captain
gad
sir

it
to
me
and
i
make
it
the
pride
of
the
country
at
a
small
expense
what
a
theatre
we
can
have
in
the
library
here
the
curtains
between
the
columns
which
divide
the
room
what
a
famous
room
for
a
galop
it

the
whole

my
old

caning
me
in

little

said
sententiously
he
always
hated

you
have

the
baronet
with
a
yawn
and
out
of

reach
of
miss
amory
confounded
piano
i
ca
bear
it
scweeching
from
morning
till
the
captain
burst
out
laughing
he
settled
the
whole
further
arrangements
of
the
house
in
the
course
of
their
walk
through
it
and
the
promenade
ended
they
went
into
the
steward
room
now
inhabited
by
blenkinsop
and
where
tatham
was
sitting
poring
over
a
plan
of
the
estate
and
the
old
housekeeper
had
prepared
a
collation
in
honour
of
her
lord
and
master
then
they
inspected
the
kitchen
and
stables
about
both
of
which
sir
francis
was
rather
interested
and
captain
strong
was
for
examining
the
gardens
but
the
baronet
said
d
the
gardens
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
finally
he
drove
away
from
the
house
as
unconcernedly
as
he
had
entered
it
and
that
night
the
people
of
clavering
learned
that
sir
francis
clavering
had
paid
a
visit
to
the
park
and
was
coming
to
live
in
the
county
when
this
fact
came
to
be
known
at
chatteris
all
the
folks
in
the
place
were
set
in
commotion
high
church
and
low
church
captains
and
old
maids
and
dowagers
sporting
squireens
of
the
viciniage
farmers
tradesmen
and
factory
people
all
the
population
in
and
round
about
the
little
place
the
news
was
brought
to
fairoaks
and
received
by
the
ladies
there
and
by
mr
pen
with
some
excitement
mrs
pybus
says
there
is
a
very
pretty
girl
in
the
family
arthur
laura
said
who
was
as
kind
and
thoughtful
upon
this
point
as
women
generally
are
a
miss
amory
lady
clavering
daughter
by
her
first
marriage
of
course
you
will
fall
in
love
with
her
as
soon
as
she

nonsense
pen
laughed
and
said
well
there
is
the
young
sir
francis
for
he
is
but
four
years
old
miss
laura
replied
but
i
shall
console
myself
with
that
handsome
officer
sir
francis
friend
he
was
at
church
last
sunday
in
the
clavering
pew
and
his
mustachios
were
indeed
the
number
of
sir
francis
family
whereof
the
members
have
all
been
mentioned
in
the
above
paragraphs
was
pretty
soon
known
in
his
town
and
everything
else
as
nearly
as
human
industry
and
ingenuity
could
calculate
regarding
his
household
the
park
avenue
and
grounds
were
dotted
now
with
town
folks
of
the
summer
evenings
who
made
their
way
up
to
the
great
house
peered
about
the
premises
and
criticised
the
improvements
which
were
taking
place
there
loads
upon
loads
of
furniture
arrived
in
numberless
vans
from
chatteris
and
london
and
numerous
as
the
vans
are
there
was
not
one
but
captain
glanders
knew
what
it
contained
and
escorted
the
baggage
up
to
the
park
house
he
and
captain
edward
strong
had
formed
an
intimate
acquaintance
by
this
time
the
younger
captain
occupied
those
very
lodgings
at
clavering
which
the
peaceful
smirke
had
previously
tenanted
and
was
deep
in
the
good
graces
of
madame
fribsby
his
landlady
and
of
the
whole
town
indeed
the
captain
was
splendid
in
person
and
raiment
athletic
a
slight
tendency
to
fulness
did
not
take
away
from
the
comeliness
of
his
jolly
figure
a
braver
soldier
never
presented
a
broader
chest
to
the
enemy
as
he
strode
down
clavering
high
street
his
hat
on
one
side
his
cane
clanking
on
the
pavement
or
waving
round
him
in
the
execution
of
military
cuts
and
soldatesque
manoeuvres
his
jolly
laughter
ringing
through
the
otherwise
silent
street
he
was
as
welcome
as
sunshine
to
the
place
and
a
comfort
to
every
inhabitant
in
it
on
the
first
he
knew
every
pretty
girl
in
the
market
he
joked
with
all
the
women
had
a
word
with
the
farmers
about
their
stock
and
dined
at
the
agricultural
ordinary
at
the
clavering
arms
where
he
set
them
all
dying
with
laughing
by
his
fun
and
jokes
tu
be
sure
he
be
a
vine
veller
tu
be
sure
that
he
be
was
the
universal
opinion
of
the
gentlemen
in
he
shook
hands
with
a
score
of
them
as
they
rode
out
of
the
on
their
old
nags
waving
his
hat
to
them
splendidly
as
he
smoked
his
cigar
in
the
in
the
course
of
the
evening
he
was
free
of
the
landlady
bar
knew
what
rent
the
landlord
paid
how
many
acres
he
farmed
how
much
malt
he
put
in
his
strong
beer
and
whether
he
ever
ran
in
a
little
brandy
unexcised
by
kings
from
baymouth
or
the
fishing
villages
along
the
coast
he
had
tried
to
live
at
the
great
house
first
but
it
was
so
dull
he
could
stand
it
i
am
a

where

had
served
captain

a
laugh
that

almost
ask

and
when

evening

i
the

it
me
he
pronounced

name
with
wonderful
accuracy
and
gusto
upon
the
field
of
ostrolenka
i
was
a
lieutenant
of
the
fourth
regiment
sir
and
we
marched
through
diebitsch
lines
bang
thro
into
prussia
sir
without
firing
a
shot
ah
captain
that
was
a
mismanaged
business
i
received
this
wound
by
the
side
of
the
king
before
oporto
where
he
would
have
pounded
the
pedroites
had
bourmont
followed
my
advice
and
i
served
in
spain
with
the
king

until

death

i
saw

game

over
and
hung
up
my
toasting
iron
captain
alava
offered
me
a
regiment
the
muleteros
but
i
could
damme
i
could
and
now
sir
you
know
ned
strong
the
chevalier
strong
they
call
me
abroad
as
well
as
he
knows
in
this
way
almost
everybody
in
clavering
came
to
know
ned
strong
he
told
madame
fribsby
he
told
the
landlord
of
the
george
he
told
baker
at
the
he
told
glanders
and
the
young
ones
at
dinner
and
finally
he
told
arthur
pendennis
who
yawning
into
clavering
one
day
found
the
chevalier
strong
in
company
with
captain
glanders
and
who
was
delighted
with
his
new
acquaintance
before
many
days
were
over
captain
strong
was
as
much
at
home
in
helen
as
he
was
in
madame
fribsby
first
floor
and
made
the
lonely
house
very
gay
with
his
and
ceaseless
flow
of
talk
the
two
women
had
never
before
seen
such
a
man
he
had
a
thousand
stories
about
battles
and
dangers
to
interest
them
about
greek
captives
polish
beauties
and
spanish
nuns
he
could
sing
scores
of
songs
in
half
a
dozen
languages
and
would
sit
down
to
the
piano
and
troll
them
off
in
a
rich
manly
voice
both
the
ladies
pronounced
him
to
be
delightful
and
so
he
was
though
indeed
they
had
not
had
much
choice
of
man
society
as
yet
having
seen
in
the
course
of
their
lives
but
few
persons
except
old
portman
and
the
major
and
mr
pen
who
was
a
genius
to
be
sure
but
then
your
geniuses
are
somewhat
flat
and
moody
at
home
and
captain
strong
acquainted
his
new
friends
at
fairoaks
not
only
with
his
own
biography
but
with
the
whole
history
of
the
family
now
coming
to
clavering
it
was
he
who
had
made
the
marriage
between
his
friend
frank
and
the
widow
amory
she
wanted
rank
and
he
wanted
money
what
match
could
be
more
suitable
he
organised
it
he
made
those
two
people
happy
there
was
no
particular
romantic
attachment
between
them
the
widow
was
not
of
an
age
or
a
person
for
romance
and
sir
francis
if
he
had
his
game
at
billiards
and
his
dinner
cared
for
little
besides
but
they
were
as
happy
as
people
could
be
clavering
would
return
to
his
native
place
and
country
his
wife
fortune
would
pay
his
encumbrances
off
and
his
son
and
heir
would
be
one
of
the
first
men
in
the
county
and
miss
amory
laura
asked
laura
was
uncommonly
curious
about
miss
amory
strong
laughed
oh
miss
amory
is
a
muse
miss
amory
is
a
mystery
miss
amory
is
a
femme
what
is
that
asked
simple
pendennis
but
the
chevalier
gave
her
no
answer
perhaps
could
not
give
her
one
miss
amory
paints
miss
amory
writes
poems
miss
amory
composes
music
miss
amory
rides
like
diana
vernon
miss
amory
is
a
paragon
in
a
i
hate
clever
women
said
pen
thank
you
said
laura
for
her
part
she
was
sure
she
should
be
charmed
with
miss
amory
and
quite
longed
to
have
such
a
friend
and
with
this
she
looked
pen
full
in
the
face
as
if
every
word
the
little
hypocrite
said
was
gospel
truth
thus
an
intimacy
was
arranged
and
prepared
beforehand
between
the
fairoaks
family
and
their
wealthy
neighbours
at
the
park
and
pen
and
laura
were
to
the
full
as
eager
for
their
arrival
as
even
the
most
curious
of
the
clavering
folks
a
londoner
who
sees
fresh
faces
and
yawns
at
them
every
day
may
smile
at
the
eagerness
with
which
country
people
expect
a
visitor
a
cockney
comes
amongst
them
and
is
remembered
by
his
rural
entertainers
for
years
after
he
has
left
them
and
forgotten
them
very
likely
floated
far
away
from
them
on
the
vast
london
sea
but
the
islanders
remember
long
after
the
mariner
has
sailed
away
and
can
tell
you
what
he
said
and
what
he
wore
and
how
he
looked
and
how
he
laughed
in
fine
a
new
arrival
is
an
event
in
the
country
not
to
be
understood
by
us
who
do
and
had
rather
not
know
who
lives
next
door
when
the
painters
and
upholsterers
had
done
their
work
in
the
house
and
so
beautified
it
under
captain
strong
superintendence
that
he
might
well
be
proud
of
his
taste
that
gentleman
announced
that
he
should
go
to
london
where
the
whole
family
had
arrived
by
this
time
and
should
speedily
return
to
establish
them
in
their
renovated
mansion
detachments
of
domestics
preceded
them
carriages
came
down
by
sea
and
were
brought
over
from
baymouth
by
horses
which
had
previously
arrived
under
the
care
of
grooms
and
coachmen
one
day
the
coach
brought
down
on
its
roof
two
large
and
melancholy
men
who
were
dropped
at
the
park
lodge
with
their
trunks
and
who
were
messieurs
frederic
and
james
metropolitan
footmen
who
had
no
objection
to
the
country
and
brought
with
them
state
and
other
suits
of
the
clavering
uniform
on
another
day
the
mail
deposited
at
the
gate
a
foreign
gentleman
adorned
with
many
ringlets
and
chains
he
made
a
great
riot
at
the
to
the
keeper
wife
who
being
a
woman
did
not
understand
his
english
or
his
gascon
french
because
there
was
no
carriage
in
waiting
to
drive
him
to
the
house
a
mile
off
and
because
he
could
not
walk
entire
leagues
in
his
fatigued
state
and
varnished
boots
this
was
monsieur
alcide
mirobolant
formerly
chef
of
his
highness
the
duc
de
borodino
of
his
eminence
cardinal
beccafico
and
at
present
chef
of
the
bouche
of
sir
clavering
baronet
monsieur
mirobolant
library
pictures
and
piano
had
arrived
previously
in
charge
of
the
intelligent
young
englishman
his
he
was
moreover
aided
by
a
professed
female
cook
likewise
from
london
who
had
inferior
females
under
her
orders
he
did
not
dine
in
the
steward
room
but
took
his
nutriment
in
solitude
in
his
own
apartments
where
a
female
servant
was
affected
to
his
private
use
it
was
a
grand
sight
to
behold
him
in
his
composing
a
menu
he
always
sate
down
and
played
the
piano
for
some
time
before
that
if
interrupted
he
remonstrated
pathetically
with
his
little
maid
every
great
artist
he
said
had
need
of
solitude
to
perfectionate
his
works
but
we
are
advancing
matters
in
the
fulness
of
our
love
and
respect
for
monsieur
mirobolant
and
bringing
him
prematurely
on
the
stage
the
chevalier
strong
had
a
hand
in
the
engagement
of
all
the
london
domestics
and
indeed
seemed
to
be
the
master
of
the
house
there
were
those
among
them
who
said
he
was
the
only
he
dined
with
the
family
howbeit
he
knew
how
to
make
himself
respected
and
two
of
by
no
means
the
least
comfortable
rooms
of
the
house
were
assigned
to
his
particular
use
he
was
walking
upon
the
terrace
finally
upon
the
eventful
day
when
amidst
an
immense
jangling
of
bells
from
clavering
church
where
the
flag
was
flying
an
open
carriage
and
one
of
those
travelling
chariots
or
family
arks
which
only
english
philoprogenitiveness
could
invent
drove
rapidly
with
foaming
horses
through
the
park
gates
and
up
to
the
steps
of
the
hall
the
two
battans
of
the
sculptured
door
flew
open
the
superior
officers
in
black
the
large
and
melancholy
gentlemen
now
in
livery
with
their
hair
in
powder
the
country
menials
engaged
to
aid
them
were
in
waiting
in
the
hall
and
bowed
like
elms
when
autumn
winds
wail
in
the
park
through
this
avenue
passed
sir
francis
clavering
with
a
most
unmoved
face
lady
clavering
with
a
pair
of
bright
black
eyes
and
a
countenance
which
waggled
and
nodded
very
graciously
master
francis
clavering
who
was
holding
his
mamma
skirt
and
who
stopped
the
procession
to
look
at
the
largest
footman
whose
appearance
seemed
to
strike
the
young
gentleman
and
miss
blandy
governess
to
master
francis
and
miss
amory
her
ladyship
daughter
giving
her
arm
to
captain
strong
it
was
summer
but
fires
of
welcome
were
crackling
in
the
great
hall
chimney
and
in
the
rooms
which
the
family
were
to
occupy
monsieur
mirobolant
had
looked
at
the
procession
from
one
of
the
in
the
avenue
elle
est
la
he
said
laying
his
jewelled
hand
on
his
velvet
glass
buttons
je
vue
je
te
benis
o
ma
sylphide
o
mon
ange
and
he
dived
into
the
thicket
and
made
his
way
back
to
his
furnaces
and
saucepans
the
next
sunday
the
same
party
which
had
just
made
its
appearance
at
clavering
park
came
and
publicly
took
possession
of
the
ancient
pew
in
the
church
where
so
many
of
the
baronet
ancestors
had
prayed
and
were
now
kneeling
in
effigy
there
was
such
a
run
to
see
the
new
folks
that
the
low
church
was
deserted
to
the
disgust
of
its
pastor
and
as
the
state
barouche
with
the
greys
and
coachman
in
silver
wig
and
solemn
footmen
drew
up
at
the
old
there
was
such
a
crowd
assembled
there
as
had
not
been
seen
for
many
a
long
day
captain
strong
knew
everybody
and
saluted
for
all
the
company
the
country
people
vowed
my
lady
was
not
handsome
to
be
sure
but
pronounced
her
to
be
uncommon
fine
dressed
as
indeed
she
was
with
the
finest
of
shawls
the
finest
of
pelisses
the
brilliantest
of
bonnets
and
wreaths
and
a
power
of
rings
cameos
brooches
chains
bangles
and
other
nameless
gimcracks
and
ribbons
of
every
breadth
and
colour
of
the
rainbow
flaming
on
her
person
miss
amory
appeared
meek
in
like
a
vestal
virgin
while
master
francis
was
in
the
costume
then
prevalent
of
rob
roy
macgregor
a
celebrated
highland
outlaw
the
baronet
was
not
more
animated
than
ordinarily
there
was
a
happy
vacuity
about
him
which
enabled
him
to
face
a
dinner
a
death
a
church
a
marriage
with
the
same
indifferent
ease
a
pew
for
the
clavering
servants
was
filled
by
these
domestics
and
the
enraptured
congregation
saw
the
gentlemen
from
london
with
vlower
on
their
heeds
and
the
miraculous
coachman
with
his
silver
wig
take
their
places
in
that
pew
so
soon
as
his
horses
were
put
up
at
the
clavering
arms
in
the
course
of
the
service
master
francis
began
to
make
such
a
yelling
in
the
pew
that
frederic
the
tallest
of
the
footmen
was
beckoned
by
his
master
and
rose
and
went
and
carried
out
master
francis
who
roared
and
beat
him
on
the
head
so
that
the
powder
flew
round
about
like
clouds
of
incense
nor
was
he
pacified
until
placed
on
the
box
of
the
carriage
where
he
played
at
horses
with
john
whip
you
see
the
little
beggar
never
been
to
church
before
miss
bell
the
baronet
drawled
out
to
a
young
lady
who
was
visiting
him
no
wonder
he
should
make
a
row
i
do
go
in
town
neither
but
i
think
it
right
in
the
country
to
give
a
good
example
and
that
sort
of
miss
bell
laughed
and
said
the
little
boy
had
not
given
a
particularly
good
gad
i
do
know
and
that
sort
of
thing
said
the
baronet
it
ai
so
bad
neither
whenever
he
wants
a
thing
frank
always
cwies
and
whenever
he
cwies
he
gets
here
the
child
in
question
began
to
howl
for
a
dish
of
sweetmeats
on
the
and
making
a
lunge
across
the
upset
a
glass
of
wine
over
the
best
waistcoat
of
one
of
the
guests
present
arthur
pendennis
who
was
greatly
annoyed
at
being
made
to
look
foolish
and
at
having
his
spotless
cambric
shirt
front
blotched
with
wine
we
do
spoil
him
so
said
lady
clavering
to
pendennis
finally
gazing
at
the
cherub
whose
hands
and
face
were
now
frothed
over
with
the
species
of
lather
which
is
inserted
in
the
confection
called
meringues
a
la
creme
it
is
very
wrong
said
pendennis
as
if
she
had
never
done
such
a
thing
herself
as
spoil
a
child
mamma
says
she
spoils
my
brother
do
you
think
anything
could
miss
bell
look
at
him
is
he
like
a
little
angel
gad

the
baronet

and
she
looked
at
her
face
and
made
a
moue
in
the
glass
and
never
stopped
for
laura
answer
to
the
questions
which
she
had
put
blanche
was
fair
and
like
a
sylph
she
had
fair
hair
with
green
reflections
in
it
but
she
had
dark
eyebrows
she
had
long
black
eyelashes
which
veiled
beautiful
brown
eyes
she
had
such
a
slim
waist
that
it
was
a
wonder
to
behold
and
such
a
slim
little
feet
that
you
would
have
thought
the
grass
would
hardly
bend
under
them
her
lips
were
of
the
colour
of
faint
rosebuds
and
her
voice
warbled
limpidly
over
a
set
of
the
sweetest
little
pearly
teeth
ever
seen
she
showed
them
very
often
for
they
were
very
pretty
she
was
very
and
a
smile
not
only
showed
her
teeth
wonderfully
but
likewise
exhibited
two
lovely
little
pink
dimples
that
nestled
in
either
cheek
she
showed
laura
her
drawings
which
the
other
thought
charming
she
played
her
some
of
her
waltzes
with
a
rapid
and
brilliant
finger
and
laura
was
still
more
charmed
and
she
then
read
her
some
poems
in
french
and
english
likewise
of
her
own
composition
and
which
she
kept
locked
in
her
own
book
her
own
dear
little
book
it
was
bound
in
blue
velvet
with
a
gilt
lock
and
on
it
was
printed
in
gold
the
title
of
larmes
mes
larmes
is
it
a
pretty
name
the
young
lady
continued
who
was
pleased
with
everything
that
she
did
and
did
everything
very
well
laura
owned
that
it
was
she
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
before
anything
so
lovely
so
accomplished
so
fragile
and
pretty
warbling
so
prettily
and
tripping
about
such
a
pretty
room
with
such
a
number
of
pretty
books
pictures
flowers
round
about
her
the
honest
and
generous
country
girl
forgot
even
jealousy
in
her
admiration
indeed
blanche
she
said
everything
in
the
room
is
pretty
and
you
are
the
prettiest
of
the
other
smiled
looked
in
the
glass
went
up
and
took
both
of
laura
hands
and
kissed
them
and
sat
down
to
the
piano
and
shook
out
a
little
song
as
if
she
had
been
a
nightingale
this
was
the
first
visit
paid
by
fairoaks
to
clavering
park
in
return
for
clavering
park
visit
to
fairoaks
in
reply
to
fairoaks
cards
left
a
few
days
after
the
arrival
of
sir
francis
family
the
intimacy
between
the
young
ladies
sprang
up
like
jack
to
the
skies
in
a
single
night
the
large
footmen
were
perpetually
walking
with
little
pink
notes
to
fairoaks
where
there
was
a
pretty
in
the
kitchen
who
might
possibly
tempt
those
gentlemen
to
so
humble
a
place
miss
amory
sent
music
or
miss
amory
sent
a
new
novel
or
a
picture
from
the
des
modes
to
laura
or
my
compliments
arrived
with
flowers
and
fruit
or
miss
amory
begged
and
prayed
miss
bell
to
come
to
dinner
and
dear
pendennis
if
she
was
strong
enough
and
arthur
if
a
humdrum
party
were
not
too
stupid
for
him
and
would
send
a
for
pendennis
and
would
take
no
denial
neither
arthur
nor
laura
wished
to
refuse
and
helen
who
was
indeed
somewhat
ailing
was
glad
that
the
two
should
have
their
pleasure
and
would
look
at
them
fondly
as
they
set
forth
and
ask
in
her
heart
that
she
might
not
be
called
away
until
those
two
beings
whom
she
loved
best
in
the
world
should
be
joined
together
as
they
went
out
and
crossed
over
the
bridge
she
remembered
summer
evenings
years
ago
when
she
too
had
bloomed
in
her
brief
prime
of
love
and
happiness
it
was
all
over
now
the
moon
was
looking
from
the
purpling
sky
and
the
stars
glittering
there
just
as
they
used
in
the
early
evenings
he
was
lying
dead
far
away
with
the
billows
rolling
between
them
good
god
how
well
she
remembered
the
last
look
of
his
face
as
they
parted
it
looked
out
at
her
through
the
vista
of
long
years
as
sad
and
as
clear
as
then
so
mr
pen
and
miss
laura
found
the
society
at
clavering
park
an
uncommonly
agreeable
resort
of
summer
evenings
blanche
vowed
that
she
raffoled
of
laura
and
very
likely
mr
pen
was
pleased
with
blanche
his
spirits
came
back
he
laughed
and
rattled
till
laura
wondered
to
hear
him
it
was
not
the
same
pen
yawning
in
a
shooting
jacket
in
the
fairoaks
parlour
who
appeared
alert
and
brisk
and
smiling
and
well
dressed
in
lady
clavering
sometimes
they
had
music
laura
had
a
sweet
contralto
voice
and
sang
with
blanche
who
had
had
the
best
continental
instruction
and
was
charmed
to
be
her
mistress
sometimes
mr
pen
joined
in
these
concerts
or
oftener
looked
sweet
upon
miss
blanche
as
she
sang
sometimes
they
had
glees
when
captain
strong
chest
was
of
vast
service
and
he
boomed
out
in
a
prodigious
bass
of
which
he
was
not
a
little
proud
good
fellow
strong
ai
he
miss
bell
sir
francis
would
say
to
her
plays
at
ecarte
with
lady
clavering
plays
anything
pianoforty
cwibbage
if
you
like
how
long
do
you
think
he
been
staying
with
me
he
came
for
a
week
with
a
and
gad
he
been
staying
here
thwee
years
good
fellow
ai
he
know
how
he
gets
a
shillin
though
begad
i
do
miss
and
yet
the
chevalier
if
he
lost
his
money
to
lady
clavering
always
paid
it
and
if
he
lived
with
his
friend
for
three
years
paid
for
that
too
in
in
kindness
and
joviality
in
a
thousand
little
services
by
which
he
made
himself
agreeable
what
gentleman
could
want
a
better
friend
than
a
man
who
was
always
in
spirits
never
in
the
way
or
out
of
it
and
was
ready
to
execute
any
commission
for
his
patron
whether
it
was
to
sing
a
song
or
meet
a
lawyer
to
fight
a
duel
or
to
carve
a
capon
although
laura
and
pen
commonly
went
to
clavering
park
together
yet
sometimes
mr
pen
took
walks
there
unattended
by
her
and
about
which
he
did
not
tell
her
he
took
to
fishing
the
brawl
which
runs
through
the
park
and
passes
not
very
far
from
the
and
by
the
oddest
coincidence
miss
amory
would
walk
out
having
been
to
look
at
her
flowers
and
would
be
quite
surprised
to
see
pendennis
fishing
i
wonder
what
trout
pen
caught
while
the
young
lady
was
looking
on
or
whether
miss
blanche
was
the
pretty
little
fish
which
played
round
his
fly
and
which
mr
pen
was
endeavouring
to
hook
it
must
be
owned
he
became
very
fond
of
that
healthful
and
invigorating
pursuit
of
angling
and
was
whipping
the
brawl
continually
with
his
fly
as
for
miss
blanche
she
had
a
kind
heart
and
having
as
she
owned
herself
suffered
a
good
deal
in
the
course
of
her
brief
life
and
experience
why
she
could
compassionate
other
susceptible
beings
like
pen
who
had
suffered
too
her
love
for
laura
and
that
dear
pendennis
redoubled
if
they
were
not
at
the
park
she
was
not
easy
unless
she
herself
was
at
fairoaks
she
played
with
laura
she
read
french
and
german
with
laura
and
mr
pen
read
french
and
german
along
with
them
he
turned
sentimental
ballads
of
schiller
and
goethe
into
english
verse
for
the
ladies
and
blanche
unlocked
larmes
for
him
and
imparted
to
him
some
of
the
plaintive
outpourings
of
her
own
tender
muse
it
appeared
from
these
poems
that
this
young
creature
had
indeed
suffered
prodigiously
she
was
familiar
with
the
idea
of
suicide
death
she
repeatedly
longed
for
a
faded
rose
inspired
her
with
such
grief
that
you
would
have
thought
she
must
die
in
pain
of
it
it
was
a
wonder
how
a
young
creature
who
had
had
a
snug
home
or
been
at
a
comfortable
and
had
no
outward
grief
or
hardship
to
complain
of
should
have
suffered
so
much
should
have
found
the
means
of
getting
at
such
an
ocean
of
despair
and
passion
as
a
runaway
boy
who
will
get
to
sea
and
having
embarked
on
it
should
survive
it
what
a
talent
she
must
have
had
for
weeping
to
be
able
to
pour
out
so
many
of
mes
larmes
they
were
not
particularly
briny
miss
blanche
tears
that
is
the
truth
but
pen
who
read
her
verses
thought
them
very
well
for
a
lady
and
wrote
some
verses
himself
for
her
his
were
very
violent
and
passionate
very
hot
sweet
and
strong
and
he
not
only
wrote
verses
but
o
the
villain
o
the
deceiver
he
altered
and
adapted
former
poems
in
his
possession
and
which
had
been
composed
for
a
certain
emily
fotheringay
for
the
use
and
to
the
christian
name
of
miss
blanche
amory
chapter
xxiv
a
little
innocent
every
house
has
its
skeleton
in
it
somewhere
and
it
may
be
a
comfort
to
some
unhappy
folks
to
think
that
the
luckier
and
most
wealthy
of
their
neighbours
have
their
miseries
and
causes
of
disquiet
our
little
innocent
muse
of
blanche
who
sang
so
nicely
and
talked
so
sweetly
you
would
have
thought
she
must
have
made
sunshine
where
ever
she
went
was
the
skeleton
or
the
misery
or
the
bore
or
the
nemesis
of
clavering
house
and
of
most
of
the
inhabitants
thereof
as
one
little
stone
in
your
own
shoe
or
your
horse
suffices
to
put
either
to
torture
and
to
make
your
journey
miserable
so
in
life
a
little
obstacle
is
sufficient
to
obstruct
your
entire
progress
and
subject
you
to
endless
annoyance
and
disquiet
who
would
have
guessed
that
such
a
smiling
little
fairy
as
blanche
amory
could
be
the
cause
of
discord
in
any
family
i
say
strong
one
day
the
baronet
said
as
the
pair
were
conversing
after
dinner
over
the
and
that
great
unbosomer
of
secrets
a
cigar
i
say
strong
i
wish
to
the
doose
your
wife
was
so
do
i
that
a
cannon
by
jove
but
she
wo
she
live
for
ever
you
see
if
she
do
why
do
you
wish
her
off
the
hooks
frank
my
boy
asked
captain
strong
because
then
you
might
marry
missy
she
ai
she
have
ten
thousand
and
that
a
good
bit
of
money
for
such
a
poor
old
devil
as
you
drawled
out
the
other
gentleman
and
gad
strong
i
hate
her
worse
and
worse
every
day
i
ca
stand
her
strong
by
gad
i
i
would
take
her
at
twice
the
figure
captain
strong
said
laughing
i
never
saw
such
a
little
devil
in
my
i
should
like
to
poison
her
said
the
sententious
baronet
by
jove
i
why
what
has
she
been
at
now
asked
his
friend
nothing
particular
answered
sir
francis
only
her
old
tricks
that
girl
has
such
a
knack
of
making
everybody
miserable
that
hang
me
quite
surprising
last
night
she
sent
the
governess
crying
away
from
the
afterwards
as
i
was
passing
frank
room
i
heard
the
poor
little
beggar
howling
in
the
dark
and
found
his
sister
had
been
frightening
his
soul
out
of
his
body
by
telling
him
stories
about
the
ghost
that
in
the
house
at
lunch
she
gave
my
lady
a
turn
and
though
my
wife
a
fool
she
a
good
soul
i
hanged
if
she
what
did
missy
do
to
her
strong
asked
why
hang
me
if
she
did
begin
talking
about
the
late
amory
my
predecessor
the
baronet
said
with
a
grin
she
got
some
picture
out
of
the
keepsake
and
said
she
was
sure
it
was
like
her
dear
father
she
wanted
to
know
where
her
father
grave
was
hang
her
father
whenever
miss
amory
talks
about
him
lady
clavering
always
bursts
out
crying
and
the
little
devil
will
talk
about
him
in
order
to
spite
her
mother
today
when
she
began
i
got
in
a
confounded
rage
said
i
was
her
father
and
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
then
sir
she
took
a
shy
at
and
what
did
she
say
about
you
frank
strong
still
laughing
inquired
of
his
friend
and
patron
gad
she
said
i
was
her
father
that
i
was
fit
to
comprehend
her
that
her
father
must
have
been
a
man
of
genius
and
fine
feelings
and
that
sort
of
thing
whereas
i
had
married
her
mother
for
well
did
you
asked
strong
it
do
make
it
any
the
pleasanter
to
hear
because
it
true
you
know
sir
francis
clavering
answered
i
ai
a
literary
man
and
that
but
i
ai
such
a
fool
as
she
makes
me
out
i
do
know
how
it
is
but
she
always
manages
to
put
me
in
the
hole
do
you
understand
she
turns
all
the
house
round
her
in
her
quiet
way
and
with
her
confounded
sentimental
airs
i
wish
she
was
dead
it
was
my
wife
whom
you
wanted
dead
just
now
strong
said
always
in
perfect
upon
which
the
baron
with
his
accustomed
candour
said
well
when
people
bore
my
life
out
i
do
wish
they
were
dead
and
i
wish
missy
were
down
a
well
with
all
my
thus
it
will
be
seen
from
the
above
report
of
this
candid
conversation
that
our
accomplished
little
friend
had
some
peculiarities
or
defects
of
character
which
rendered
her
not
very
popular
she
was
a
young
lady
of
some
genius
exquisite
sympathies
and
considerable
literary
attainments
living
like
many
another
genius
with
relatives
who
could
not
comprehend
her
neither
her
mother
nor
her
stepfather
were
persons
of
a
literary
turn
bell
life
and
the
racing
calendar
were
the
extent
of
the
baronet
reading
and
lady
clavering
still
wrote
like
a
schoolgirl
of
thirteen
and
with
an
extraordinary
disregard
to
grammar
and
spelling
and
as
miss
amory
felt
very
keenly
that
she
was
not
appreciated
and
that
she
lived
with
persons
who
were
not
her
equals
in
intellect
or
conversational
power
she
lost
no
opportunity
to
acquaint
her
family
circle
with
their
inferiority
to
herself
and
not
only
was
a
martyr
but
took
care
to
let
everybody
know
that
she
was
so
if
she
suffered
as
she
said
and
thought
she
did
severely
are
we
to
wonder
that
a
young
creature
of
such
delicate
sensibilities
should
shriek
and
cry
out
a
good
deal
without
sympathy
life
is
nothing
and
would
it
not
have
been
a
want
of
candour
on
her
part
to
affect
a
cheerfulness
which
she
did
not
feel
or
pretend
a
respect
for
those
towards
whom
it
was
quite
impossible
she
should
entertain
any
reverence
if
a
poetess
may
not
bemoan
her
lot
of
what
earthly
use
is
her
lyre
blanche
struck
hers
only
to
the
saddest
of
tunes
and
sang
elegies
over
her
dead
hopes
dirges
over
her
early
buds
of
affection
as
became
such
a
melancholy
fate
and
muse
her
actual
distresses
as
we
have
said
had
not
been
up
to
the
present
time
very
considerable
but
her
griefs
lay
like
those
of
most
of
us
in
her
own
soul
that
being
sad
and
habitually
dissatisfied
what
wonder
that
she
should
weep
so
mes
larmes
dribbled
out
of
her
eyes
any
day
at
command
she
could
furnish
an
unlimited
supply
of
tears
and
her
faculty
of
shedding
them
increased
by
practice
for
sentiment
is
like
another
complaint
mentioned
by
horace
as
increasing
by
i
am
sorry
to
say
ladies
that
the
complaint
in
question
is
called
the
dropsy
and
the
more
you
cry
the
more
you
will
be
able
and
desirous
to
do
so
missy
had
begun
to
gush
at
a
very
early
age
lamartine
was
her
favourite
bard
from
the
period
when
she
first
could
feel
and
she
had
subsequently
improved
her
mind
by
a
sedulous
study
of
novels
of
the
great
modern
authors
of
the
french
language
there
was
not
a
romance
of
balzac
and
george
sand
which
the
indefatigable
little
creature
had
not
devoured
by
the
time
she
was
sixteen
and
however
little
she
sympathised
with
her
relatives
at
home
she
had
friends
as
she
said
in
the
meaning
the
tender
indiana
the
passionate
and
poetic
lelia
the
amiable
trenmor
that
convict
that
angel
of
the
galleys
the
fiery
stenio
and
the
other
numberless
heroes
of
the
french
romances
she
had
been
in
love
with
prince
rodolph
and
prince
djalma
while
she
was
yet
at
school
and
had
settled
the
divorce
question
and
the
rights
of
woman
with
indiana
before
she
had
left
off
pinafores
the
impetuous
little
lady
played
at
love
with
these
imaginary
worthies
as
a
little
while
before
she
had
played
at
maternity
with
her
doll
pretty
little
poetical
spirits
it
is
curious
to
watch
them
with
those
playthings
the
one
is
the
favourite
and
the
one
is
pushed
behind
the
drawers
may
take
its
turn
of
neglect
and
it
may
be
an
odious
little
wretch
with
a
burnt
nose
or
torn
bead
of
hair
and
no
eyes
at
all
that
takes
the
first
place
in
miss
affection
and
is
dandled
and
caressed
in
her
arms
as
novelists
are
supposed
to
know
everything
even
the
secrets
of
female
hearts
which
the
owners
themselves
do
not
perhaps
know
we
may
state
that
at
eleven
years
of
age
mademoiselle
betsi
as
miss
amory
was
then
called
had
felt
tender
emotions
towards
a
young
savoyard
at
paris
whom
she
persisted
in
believing
to
be
a
prince
carried
off
from
his
parents
that
at
twelve
an
old
and
hideous
but
ah
what
age
or
personal
defects
are
proof
against
woman
love
had
agitated
her
young
heart
and
that
at
thirteen
being
at
madame
de
caramel
in
the
champs
elysees
which
as
everybody
knows
is
next
door
to
monsieur
rogron
chevalier
of
the
legion
of
honour
pension
for
young
gentlemen
a
correspondence
by
letter
took
place
between
the
seduisante
miss
betsi
and
two
young
gentlemen
of
the
college
of
charlemagne
who
were
pensioners
of
the
chevalier
rogron
in
the
above
paragraph
our
young
friend
has
been
called
by
a
christian
name
different
to
that
under
which
we
were
lately
presented
to
her
the
fact
is
that
miss
amory
called
missy
at
home
had
really
at
the
first
been
christened
betsy
but
assumed
the
name
of
blanche
of
her
own
will
and
fantasy
and
crowned
herself
with
it
and
the
weapon
which
the
baronet
her
stepfather
held
in
terror
over
her
was
the
threat
to
call
her
publicly
by
her
name
of
betsy
by
which
menace
he
sometimes
managed
to
keep
the
young
rebel
in
order
we
have
spoken
just
now
of
children
dolls
and
of
the
manner
in
which
those
little
people
take
up
and
neglect
their
darling
toys
and
very
likely
this
history
will
show
that
miss
blanche
assumed
and
put
away
her
live
dolls
with
a
similar
girlish
inconstancy
she
had
had
hosts
of
dear
dear
darling
friends
ere
now
and
had
quite
a
little
museum
of
locks
of
hair
in
her
which
she
had
gathered
in
the
course
of
her
sentimental
progress
some
dear
friends
had
married
some
had
gone
to
other
schools
one
beloved
sister
she
had
lost
from
the
pension
and
found
again
o
horror
her
darling
her
leocadie
keeping
the
books
in
her
father
shop
a
grocer
in
the
rue
du
bac
in
fact
she
had
met
with
a
number
of
disappointments
estrangements
disillusionments
as
she
called
them
in
her
pretty
french
jargon
and
had
seen
and
suffered
a
great
deal
for
so
young
a
woman
but
it
is
the
lot
of
sensibility
to
suffer
and
of
confiding
tenderness
to
be
deceived
and
she
felt
that
she
was
only
undergoing
the
penalties
of
genius
in
these
pangs
and
disappointments
of
her
young
career
meanwhile
she
managed
to
make
the
honest
lady
her
mother
as
uncomfortable
as
circumstances
would
permit
and
caused
her
worthy
stepfather
to
wish
she
was
dead
with
the
exception
of
captain
strong
whose
invincible
was
proof
against
her
sarcasms
the
little
lady
ruled
the
whole
house
with
he
tongue
if
lady
clavering
talked
about
sparrowgrass
instead
of
asparagus
or
called
an
object
a
hobject
as
this
unfortunate
lady
would
sometimes
do
missy
calmly
corrected
her
and
frightened
the
good
soul
her
mother
into
errors
only
the
more
frequent
as
she
grew
more
nervous
under
her
daughter
eye
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
considering
the
vast
interest
which
the
arrival
of
the
family
at
clavering
park
inspired
in
the
inhabitants
of
the
little
town
that
madame
fribsby
alone
of
all
the
folks
in
clavering
should
have
remained
unmoved
and
incurious
at
the
first
appearance
of
the
park
family
in
church
madame
noted
every
article
of
toilette
which
the
ladies
wore
from
their
bonnets
to
their
brodequins
and
took
a
survey
of
the
attire
of
the
ladies
maids
in
the
pew
allotted
to
them
we
fear
that
doctor
portman
sermon
though
it
was
one
of
his
oldest
and
most
valued
compositions
had
little
effect
upon
madame
fribsby
on
that
day
in
a
very
few
days
afterwards
she
had
managed
for
herself
an
interview
with
lady
clavering
confidential
attendant
in
the
housekeeper
room
at
the
park
and
her
cards
in
french
and
english
stating
that
she
received
the
newest
fashions
from
paris
from
her
correspondent
madame
victorine
and
that
she
was
in
the
custom
of
making
court
and
ball
dresses
for
the
nobility
and
gentry
of
the
shire
were
in
the
possession
of
lady
clavering
and
miss
amory
and
favourably
received
as
she
was
happy
to
hear
by
those
ladies
bonner
lady
clavering
lady
became
soon
a
great
frequenter
of
madame
fribsby
and
partook
of
many
entertainments
at
the
milliner
expense
a
meal
of
green
tea
scandal
hot
cakes
and
a
little
novel
reading
were
always
at
the
service
of
bonner
whenever
she
was
free
to
pass
an
evening
in
the
town
and
she
found
much
more
time
for
these
pleasures
than
her
junior
officer
miss
maid
who
seldom
could
be
spared
for
a
holiday
and
was
worked
as
hard
as
any
by
that
inexorable
little
muse
her
mistress
the
muse
loved
to
be
dressed
becomingly
and
having
a
lively
fancy
and
a
poetic
desire
for
change
was
for
altering
her
attire
every
day
her
maid
having
a
taste
in
dressmaking
to
which
art
she
had
been
an
apprentice
at
paris
before
she
entered
into
miss
blanche
service
there
was
kept
from
morning
till
night
altering
and
remodelling
miss
amory
habiliments
and
rose
very
early
and
went
to
bed
very
late
in
obedience
to
the
untiring
caprices
of
her
little
taskmistress
the
girl
was
of
respectable
english
parents
there
are
many
of
our
people
colonists
of
paris
who
have
seen
better
days
who
are
not
quite
ruined
who
do
not
quite
live
upon
charity
and
yet
can
not
get
on
without
it
and
as
her
father
was
a
cripple
incapable
of
work
and
her
return
home
would
only
increase
the
burthen
and
add
to
the
misery
of
the
family
poor
pincott
was
fain
to
stay
where
she
could
maintain
herself
and
spare
a
little
relief
to
her
parents
our
muse
with
the
candour
which
distinguished
her
never
failed
to
remind
her
attendant
of
the
real
state
of
matters
i
should
send
you
away
pincott
for
you
are
a
great
deal
too
weak
and
your
eyes
are
failing
you
and
you
are
always
crying
and
snivelling
and
wanting
the
doctor
but
i
wish
that
your
parents
at
home
should
be
supported
and
i
go
on
enduring
you
for
their
sake
mind
the
dear
blanche
would
say
to
her
timid
little
attendant
or
pincott
your
wretched
appearance
and
slavish
manner
and
red
eyes
positively
give
me
the
migraine
and
i
think
i
shall
make
you
wear
rouge
so
that
you
may
look
a
little
cheerful
or
pincott
i
ca
bear
even
for
the
sake
of
your
starving
parents
that
you
should
tear
my
hair
out
of
my
head
in
that
manner
and
i
will
thank
you
to
write
to
them
and
say
that
i
dispense
with
your
after
which
sort
of
speeches
and
after
keeping
her
for
an
hour
trembling
over
her
hair
which
the
young
lady
loved
to
have
combed
as
she
perused
one
of
her
favourite
french
novels
she
would
go
to
bed
at
one
and
say
pincott
you
may
kiss
me
good
night
i
should
like
you
to
have
the
pink
dress
ready
for
the
and
so
with
blessing
upon
her
attendant
she
would
turn
round
and
go
to
sleep
the
muse
might
lie
in
bed
as
long
as
she
chose
of
a
morning
and
availed
herself
of
that
privilege
but
pincott
had
to
rise
very
early
indeed
to
get
her
mistress
task
done
and
had
to
appear
next
day
with
the
same
red
eyes
and
the
same
wan
face
which
displeased
miss
amory
by
their
want
of
gaiety
and
caused
the
mistress
to
be
so
angry
because
the
servant
persisted
in
being
and
looking
unwell
and
unhappy
not
that
blanche
ever
thought
she
was
a
hard
mistress
indeed
she
made
quite
a
friend
of
pincott
at
times
and
wrote
some
very
pretty
verses
about
the
lonely
little
whose
heart
was
far
away
our
beloved
blanche
was
a
superior
being
and
expected
to
be
waited
upon
as
such
and
i
do
not
know
whether
there
are
any
other
ladies
in
this
world
who
treat
their
servants
or
dependants
so
but
it
may
be
that
there
are
such
and
that
the
tyranny
which
they
exercise
over
their
subordinates
and
the
pangs
which
they
can
manage
to
inflict
with
a
soft
voice
and
a
simper
are
as
cruel
as
those
which
a
administers
with
an
oath
and
a
whip
but
blanche
was
a
muse
a
delicate
little
creature
quite
tremulous
with
excitability
whose
eyes
filled
with
tears
at
the
smallest
emotion
and
who
knows
but
that
it
was
the
very
fineness
of
her
feelings
which
caused
them
to
be
froissed
so
easily
you
crush
a
butterfly
by
merely
touching
it
vulgar
people
have
no
idea
of
the
sensibility
of
a
muse
so
little
pincott
being
occupied
all
day
and
night
in
stitching
hemming
ripping
combing
ironing
crimping
for
her
mistress
reading
to
her
when
in
bed
for
the
girl
was
mistress
of
the
two
languages
and
had
a
sweet
voice
and
manner
could
take
no
share
in
madame
soirees
nor
indeed
was
she
much
missed
or
considered
of
sufficient
consequence
to
appear
at
their
entertainments
but
there
was
another
person
connected
with
the
clavering
establishment
who
became
a
constant
guest
of
our
friend
the
milliner
this
was
the
chief
of
the
kitchen
monsieur
mirobolant
with
whom
madame
fribsby
soon
formed
an
intimacy
not
having
been
accustomed
to
the
appearance
or
society
of
persons
of
the
french
nation
the
rustic
inhabitants
of
clavering
were
not
so
favourably
impressed
by
monsieur
alcide
manners
and
appearance
as
that
gentleman
might
have
desired
that
they
should
be
he
walked
among
them
quite
unsuspiciously
upon
the
afternoon
of
a
summer
day
when
his
services
were
not
required
at
the
house
in
his
usual
favourite
costume
namely
his
light
green
frock
or
paletot
his
crimson
velvet
waistcoat
with
blue
glass
buttons
his
pantalon
ecossais
of
a
very
large
and
decided
check
pattern
his
orange
satin
neckcloth
and
his
with
tips
of
shiny
leather
these
with
a
cap
and
a
richly
gilt
cane
or
other
varieties
of
ornament
of
a
similar
tendency
formed
his
usual
holiday
costume
in
which
he
flattered
himself
there
was
nothing
remarkable
unless
indeed
the
beauty
of
his
person
should
attract
observation
and
in
which
he
considered
that
he
exhibited
the
appearance
of
a
gentleman
of
good
parisian
ton
he
walked
then
down
the
street
grinning
and
ogling
every
woman
he
met
with
glances
which
he
meant
should
kill
them
outright
and
peered
over
the
railings
and
in
at
the
windows
where
females
were
in
the
tranquil
summer
evening
but
betsy
pybus
maid
shrank
back
with
a
lor
bless
us
as
alcide
ogled
her
over
the
the
miss
bakers
and
their
mamma
stared
with
wonder
and
presently
a
crowd
began
to
follow
the
interesting
foreigner
of
ragged
urchins
and
children
who
left
their
in
the
street
to
pursue
him
for
some
time
he
thought
that
admiration
was
the
cause
which
led
these
persons
in
his
wake
and
walked
on
pleased
himself
that
he
could
so
easily
confer
on
others
so
much
harmless
pleasure
but
the
little
children
and
manufacturers
were
presently
succeeded
by
followers
of
a
larger
growth
and
a
number
of
lads
and
girls
from
the
factory
being
let
loose
at
this
hour
joined
the
mob
and
began
laughing
jeering
hooting
and
calling
opprobrious
names
at
the
frenchman
some
cried
out
frenchy
frenchy
some
exclaimed
frogs
one
asked
for
a
lock
of
his
hair
which
was
long
and
in
ringlets
and
at
length
the
poor
artist
began
to
perceive
that
he
was
an
object
of
derision
rather
than
of
respect
to
the
rude
grinning
mob
it
was
at
this
juncture
that
madame
fribsby
spied
the
unlucky
gentleman
with
the
train
at
his
heels
and
heard
the
scornful
shouts
with
which
they
assailed
him
she
ran
out
of
her
room
and
across
the
street
to
the
persecuted
foreigner
she
held
out
her
hand
and
addressing
him
in
his
own
language
invited
him
into
her
abode
and
when
she
had
housed
him
fairly
within
her
door
she
stood
bravely
at
the
threshold
before
the
gibing
factory
girls
and
boys
and
said
they
were
a
pack
of
cowards
to
insult
a
poor
man
who
could
not
speak
their
language
and
was
alone
and
without
protection
the
little
crowd
with
some
ironical
cheers
and
hootings
nevertheless
felt
the
force
of
madame
fribsby
vigorous
allocution
and
retreated
before
her
for
the
old
lady
was
rather
respected
in
the
place
and
her
oddity
and
her
kindness
had
made
her
many
friends
there
poor
mirobolant
was
grateful
indeed
to
hear
the
language
of
his
country
ever
so
ill
spoken
frenchmen
pardon
our
faults
in
their
language
much
more
readily
than
we
excuse
their
bad
english
and
will
face
our
blunders
throughout
a
long
conversation
without
the
least
propensity
to
grin
the
rescued
artist
vowed
that
madame
fribsby
was
his
guardian
angel
and
that
he
had
not
as
yet
met
with
such
suavity
and
politeness
among
les
anglaises
he
was
as
courteous
and
complimentary
to
her
as
if
it
was
the
fairest
and
noblest
of
ladies
whom
he
was
addressing
for
alcide
mirobolant
paid
homage
after
his
fashion
to
all
womankind
and
never
dreamed
of
a
distinction
of
ranks
in
the
realms
of
beauty
as
his
phrase
was
a
cream
flavoured
with
pineapple
a
mayonnaise
of
lobster
which
he
flattered
himself
was
not
unworthy
of
his
hand
or
of
her
to
whom
he
had
the
honour
to
offer
it
as
an
homage
and
a
box
of
preserved
fruits
of
provence
were
brought
by
one
of
the
chef
in
a
basket
the
next
day
to
the
milliner
and
were
accompanied
with
a
gallant
note
to
the
amiable
madame
fribsbi
her
kindness
alcide
said
had
made
a
green
place
in
the
desert
of
his
existence
her
suavity
would
ever
contrast
in
memory
with
the
grossierete
of
the
rustic
population
who
were
not
worthy
to
possess
such
a
an
intimacy
of
the
most
confidential
nature
thus
sprang
up
between
the
milliner
and
the
chief
of
the
kitchen
but
i
do
not
know
whether
it
was
with
pleasure
or
mortification
that
madame
received
the
declarations
of
friendship
which
the
young
alcides
proffered
to
her
for
he
persisted
in
calling
her
la
respectable
fribsbi
la
vertueuse
fribsbi
and
in
stating
that
he
should
consider
her
as
his
mother
while
he
hoped
she
would
regard
him
as
her
son
ah
it
was
not
very
long
ago
fribsby
thought
that
words
had
been
addressed
to
her
in
that
dear
french
language
indicating
a
different
sort
of
attachment
and
she
sighed
as
she
looked
up
at
the
picture
of
her
carabineer
for
it
is
surprising
how
young
some
hearts
remain
when
their
heads
have
need
of
a
front
or
a
little
and
at
this
moment
madame
fribsby
as
she
told
young
alcide
felt
as
romantic
as
a
girl
of
eighteen
when
the
conversation
took
this
turn
and
at
their
first
intimacy
madame
fribsby
was
rather
inclined
so
to
lead
it
alcide
always
politely
diverged
to
another
subject
it
was
as
his
mother
that
he
persisted
in
considering
the
good
milliner
he
would
recognise
her
in
no
other
capacity
and
with
that
relationship
the
gentle
lady
was
forced
to
content
herself
when
she
found
how
deeply
the
artist
heart
was
engaged
elsewhere
he
was
not
long
before
he
described
to
her
the
subject
and
origin
of
his
passion
i
declared
myself
to
her
said
alcide
laying
his
hand
on
his
heart
in
a
manner
which
was
as
novel
as
i
am
charmed
to
think
it
was
agreeable
where
can
not
love
penetrate
respectable
madame
fribsbi
cupid
is
the
father
of
invention
i
inquired
of
the
domestics
what
were
the
plats
of
which
mademoiselle
partook
with
most
pleasure
and
built
up
my
little
battery
accordingly
on
a
day
when
her
parents
had
gone
to
dine
in
the
world
and
i
am
grieved
to
say
that
a
grossier
dinner
at
a
restaurateur
in
the
boulevard
or
in
the
palais
royal
seemed
to
form
the
delights
of
these
unrefined
persons
the
charming
miss
entertained
some
comrades
of
the
pension
and
i
advised
myself
to
send
up
a
little
repast
suitable
to
so
delicate
young
palates
her
lovely
name
is
blanche
the
name
of
the
maiden
is
white
the
wreath
of
roses
which
she
wears
is
white
i
determined
that
my
dinner
should
be
as
spotless
as
the
snow
at
her
accustomed
hour
and
instead
of
the
rude
gigot
a
which
was
ordinarily
served
at
her
too
simple
table
i
sent
her
up
a
little
potage
a
la
reine
a
la
reine
blanche
i
called
it
as
white
as
her
own
tint
and
confectioned
with
the
most
fragrant
cream
and
almonds
i
then
offered
up
at
her
shrine
a
filet
de
merlan
à
and
a
delicate
plat
which
i
designated
as
eperlan
a
la
and
of
which
my
charming
miss
partook
with
pleasure
i
followed
this
by
two
little
entrees
of
sweetbread
and
chicken
and
the
only
brown
thing
which
i
permitted
myself
in
the
entertainment
was
a
little
roast
of
lamb
which
i
lay
in
a
meadow
of
spinaches
surrounded
with
croustillons
representing
sheep
and
ornamented
with
daisies
and
other
savage
flowers
after
this
came
my
second
service
a
pudding
a
la
reine
elizabeth
who
madame
fribsbi
knows
was
a
maiden
princess
a
dish
of
plover
eggs
which
i
called
nid
de
tourtereaux
a
la
roucoule
placing
in
the
midst
of
them
two
of
those
tender
volatiles
billing
each
other
and
confectioned
with
butter
a
basket
containing
little
gateaux
of
apricots
which
i
know
all
young
ladies
adore
and
a
jelly
of
marasquin
bland
insinuating
intoxicating
as
the
glance
of
beauty
this
i
designated
ambroisie
de
calypso
a
la
souveraine
de
mon
coeur
and
when
the
ice
was
brought
in
an
ice
of
plombiere
and
cherries
how
do
you
think
i
had
shaped
them
madame
fribsbi
in
the
form
of
two
hearts
united
with
an
arrow
on
which
i
had
laid
before
it
entered
a
bridal
veil
in
surmounted
by
a
wreath
of
virginal
i
stood
at
the
door
to
watch
the
effect
of
this
entry
it
was
but
one
cry
of
admiration
the
three
young
ladies
filled
their
glasses
with
the
sparkling
ay
and
carried
me
in
a
toast
i
heard
it
i
heard
miss
speak
of
me
i
heard
her
say
monsieur
mirobolant
that
we
thank
him
we
admire
him
we
love
him
my
feet
almost
failed
me
as
she
spoke
since
that
can
i
have
any
reason
to
doubt
that
the
young
artist
has
made
some
progress
in
the
heart
of
the
english
miss
i
am
modest
but
my
glass
informs
me
that
i
am
not
other
victories
have
convinced
me
of
the
dangerous
man
cried
the
milliner
the
blond
misses
of
albion
see
nothing
in
the
dull
inhabitants
of
their
brumous
isle
which
can
compare
with
the
ardour
and
vivacity
of
the
children
of
the
south
we
bring
our
sunshine
with
us
we
are
frenchmen
and
accustomed
to
conquer
were
it
not
for
this
affair
of
the
heart
and
my
determination
to
marry
an
anglaise
do
you
think
i
would
stop
in
this
island
which
is
not
altogether
ungrateful
since
i
have
found
here
a
tender
mother
in
the
respectable
madame
fribsbi
in
this
island
in
this
family
my
genius
would
use
itself
in
the
company
of
these
rustics
the
poesy
of
my
art
can
not
be
understood
by
these
carnivorous
insularies
no
the
men
are
odious
but
the
women
the
women
i
own
dear
fribsbi
are
seducing
i
have
vowed
to
marry
one
and
as
i
can
not
go
into
your
markets
and
purchase
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
i
am
resolved
to
adopt
another
custom
and
fly
with
one
to
gretna
grin
the
blonde
miss
will
go
she
is
fascinated
her
eyes
have
told
me
so
the
white
dove
wants
but
the
signal
to
have
you
any
correspondence
with
her
asked
fribsby
in
amazement
and
not
knowing
whether
the
young
lady
or
the
lover
might
be
labouring
under
a
romantic
delusion
i
correspond
with
her
by
means
of
my
art
she
partakes
of
dishes
which
i
make
expressly
for
her
i
insinuate
to
her
thus
a
thousand
hints
which
as
she
is
perfectly
spiritual
she
receives
but
i
want
other
intelligences
near
there
is
pincott
her
maid
said
madame
fribsby
who
by
aptitude
or
education
seemed
to
have
some
knowledge
of
affairs
of
the
heart
but
the
great
artist
brow
darkened
at
this
suggestion
madame
he
said
there
are
points
upon
which
a
gallant
man
ought
to
silence
himself
though
if
he
break
the
secret
he
may
do
so
with
the
least
impropriety
to
his
best
friend
his
adopted
mother
know
then
that
there
is
a
cause
why
miss
pincott
should
be
hostile
to
me
a
cause
not
uncommon
with
your
sex
perfidious
monster
said
the
confidante
ah
no
said
the
artist
with
a
deep
bass
voice
and
a
tragic
accent
worthy
of
the
port
st
martin
and
his
favourite
melodrames
not
perfidious
but
fatal
yes
i
am
a
fatal
man
madame
fribsbi
to
inspire
hopeless
passion
is
my
destiny
i
can
not
help
it
that
women
love
me
is
it
my
fault
that
that
young
woman
deperishes
and
languishes
to
the
view
of
the
eye
consumed
by
a
flame
which
i
can
not
return
listen
there
are
others
in
this
family
who
are
similarly
unhappy
the
governess
of
the
young
milor
has
encountered
me
in
my
walks
and
looked
at
me
in
a
way
which
can
bear
but
one
interpretation
and
milady
herself
who
is
of
mature
age
but
who
has
oriental
blood
has
once
or
twice
addressed
compliments
to
the
lonely
artist
which
can
admit
of
no
mistake
i
avoid
the
household
i
seek
solitude
i
undergo
my
destiny
i
can
marry
but
one
and
am
resolved
it
shall
be
to
a
lady
of
your
nation
and
if
her
fortune
is
sufficient
i
think
miss
would
be
the
person
who
would
be
most
suitable
i
wish
to
ascertain
what
her
means
are
before
i
lead
her
to
gretna
whether
alcides
was
as
irresistible
a
conqueror
as
his
namesake
or
whether
he
was
simply
crazy
is
a
point
which
must
be
left
to
the
reader
judgment
but
the
latter
if
he
had
had
the
benefit
of
much
french
acquaintance
has
perhaps
met
with
men
amongst
them
who
fancied
themselves
almost
as
invincible
and
who
if
you
credit
them
have
made
equal
havoc
in
the
hearts
of
les
anglaises
chapter
xxv
contains
both
love
and
jealousy
our
readers
have
already
heard
sir
francis
clavering
candid
opinion
of
the
lady
who
had
given
him
her
fortune
and
restored
him
to
his
native
country
and
home
and
it
must
be
owned
that
the
baronet
was
not
far
wrong
in
his
estimate
of
his
wife
and
that
lady
clavering
was
not
the
wisest
or
the
best
educated
of
women
she
had
had
a
couple
of
education
in
europe
in
a
suburb
of
london
which
she
persisted
in
calling
ackney
to
her
dying
day
whence
she
had
been
summoned
to
join
her
father
at
calcutta
at
the
age
of
fifteen
and
it
was
on
her
voyage
thither
on
board
the
ramchunder
east
indiaman
captain
bragg
in
which
ship
she
had
two
years
previously
made
her
journey
to
europe
that
she
formed
the
acquaintance
of
her
first
husband
amory
who
was
third
mate
of
the
vessel
in
question
we
are
not
going
to
enter
into
the
early
part
of
lady
history
but
captain
bragg
under
whose
charge
miss
snell
went
out
to
her
father
who
was
one
of
the
captain
consignees
and
part
owner
of
the
ramchunder
and
many
other
vessels
found
reason
to
put
the
rebellious
rascal
of
a
mate
in
irons
until
they
reached
the
cape
where
the
captain
left
his
officer
behind
and
finally
delivered
his
ward
to
her
father
at
calcutta
after
a
stormy
and
perilous
voyage
in
which
the
ramchunder
and
the
cargo
and
passengers
incurred
no
small
danger
and
damage
some
months
afterwards
amory
made
his
appearance
at
calcutta
having
worked
his
way
out
before
the
mast
from
the
cape
married
the
rich
attorney
daughter
in
spite
of
that
old
speculator
set
up
as
and
failed
set
up
as
agent
and
failed
again
set
up
as
editor
of
the
sunderbund
pilot
and
failed
again
quarrelling
ceaselessly
with
his
and
his
wife
during
the
progress
of
all
these
mercantile
transactions
and
disasters
and
ending
his
career
finally
with
a
crash
which
compelled
him
to
leave
calcutta
and
go
to
new
south
wales
it
was
in
the
course
of
these
luckless
proceedings
that
amory
probably
made
the
acquaintance
of
sir
jasper
rogers
the
respected
judge
of
the
supreme
court
of
calcutta
who
has
been
mentioned
before
and
as
the
truth
must
out
it
was
by
making
an
improper
use
of
his
name
who
could
write
perfectly
well
and
had
no
need
of
an
amanuensis
that
fortune
finally
forsook
amory
and
caused
him
to
abandon
all
further
struggles
with
her
not
being
in
the
habit
of
reading
the
calcutta
very
assiduously
the
european
public
did
not
know
of
these
facts
as
well
as
people
did
in
bengal
and
amory
and
her
father
finding
her
residence
in
india
not
a
comfortable
one
it
was
agreed
that
the
lady
should
return
to
europe
whither
she
came
with
her
little
daughter
betsy
or
blanche
then
four
years
old
they
were
accompanied
by
nurse
who
has
been
presented
to
the
reader
in
the
last
chapter
as
the
confidential
maid
of
lady
clavering
bonner
and
captain
bragg
took
a
house
for
them
in
the
near
neighbourhood
of
his
residence
in
pocklington
street
it
was
a
very
hard
bitter
summer
and
the
rain
it
rained
every
day
for
some
time
after
amory
arrival
bragg
was
very
pompous
and
disagreeable
perhaps
ashamed
perhaps
anxious
to
get
rid
of
the
indian
lady
she
believed
that
all
the
world
in
london
was
talking
about
her
husband
disaster
and
that
the
king
and
queen
and
the
court
of
directors
were
aware
of
her
unlucky
history
she
had
a
good
allowance
from
her
father
she
had
no
call
to
live
in
england
and
she
determined
to
go
abroad
away
she
went
then
glad
to
escape
the
gloomy
surveillance
of
the
odious
bully
captain
bragg
people
had
no
objection
to
receive
her
at
the
continental
towns
where
she
stopped
and
at
the
various
where
she
royally
paid
her
way
she
called
hackney
ackney
to
be
sure
though
otherwise
she
spoke
english
with
a
little
foreign
twang
very
curious
and
not
unpleasant
she
dressed
amazingly
she
was
conspicuous
for
her
love
of
eating
and
drinking
and
prepared
curries
and
pillaws
at
every
which
she
frequented
but
her
singularities
of
language
and
behaviour
only
gave
a
zest
to
her
society
and
amory
was
deservedly
popular
she
was
the
most
jovial
and
generous
of
women
she
was
up
to
any
party
of
pleasure
by
whomsoever
proposed
she
brought
three
times
more
champagne
and
fowl
and
ham
to
the
picnics
than
anyone
else
she
took
endless
boxes
for
the
play
and
tickets
for
the
masked
balls
and
gave
them
away
to
everybody
she
paid
the
people
months
beforehand
she
helped
poor
shabby
mustachiod
bucks
and
dowagers
whose
remittances
had
not
arrived
with
constant
supplies
from
her
purse
and
in
this
way
she
tramped
through
europe
and
appeared
at
brussels
at
paris
at
milan
at
naples
at
rome
as
her
fancy
led
her
news
of
amory
death
reached
her
at
the
latter
place
where
captain
clavering
was
then
staying
unable
to
pay
his
hotel
bill
as
indeed
was
his
friend
the
chevalier
strong
and
the
widow
married
the
descendant
of
the
ancient
house
of
clavering
professing
indeed
no
particular
grief
for
the
scapegrace
of
a
husband
whom
she
had
lost
we
have
brought
her
thus
up
to
the
present
time
when
she
was
mistress
of
clavering
park
in
the
midst
of
which
pinckney
the
celebrated
painter
pourtrayed
her
with
her
little
boy
by
her
side
missy
followed
her
mamma
in
most
of
her
peregrinations
and
so
learned
a
deal
of
life
she
had
a
governess
for
some
time
and
after
her
second
marriage
the
benefit
of
madame
de
caramel
select
pension
in
the
champs
elysees
when
the
claverings
came
to
england
she
of
course
came
with
them
it
was
only
within
a
few
years
after
the
death
of
her
grandfather
and
the
birth
of
her
little
brother
that
she
began
to
understand
that
her
position
in
life
was
altered
and
that
miss
amory
nobody
daughter
was
a
very
small
personage
in
a
house
compared
with
master
francis
clavering
heir
to
an
ancient
baronetcy
and
a
noble
estate
but
for
little
frank
she
would
have
been
an
heiress
in
spite
of
her
father
and
though
she
knew
and
cared
not
much
about
money
of
which
she
never
had
any
stint
and
though
she
was
a
romantic
little
muse
as
we
have
seen
yet
she
could
not
reasonably
be
grateful
to
the
persons
who
had
so
contributed
to
change
her
condition
nor
indeed
did
she
understand
what
the
latter
really
was
until
she
had
made
some
further
progress
and
acquired
more
accurate
knowledge
in
the
world
but
this
was
clear
that
her
stepfather
was
dull
and
weak
that
mamma
dropped
her
h
and
was
not
refined
in
manners
or
appearance
and
that
little
frank
was
a
spoiled
quarrelsome
urchin
always
having
his
way
always
treading
upon
her
feet
always
upsetting
his
dinner
on
her
dresses
and
keeping
her
out
of
her
inheritance
none
of
these
as
she
felt
could
comprehend
her
and
her
solitary
heart
naturally
pined
for
other
attachments
and
she
sought
around
her
where
to
bestow
the
precious
boon
of
her
unoccupied
affection
this
dear
girl
then
from
want
of
sympathy
or
other
cause
made
herself
so
disagreeable
at
home
and
frightened
her
mother
and
bored
her
stepfather
so
much
that
they
were
quite
as
anxious
as
she
could
be
that
she
should
settle
for
herself
in
life
and
hence
sir
francis
desire
expressed
to
his
friend
in
the
last
chapter
that
strong
should
die
and
that
he
would
take
blanche
to
himself
as
a
second
strong
but
as
this
could
not
be
any
other
person
was
welcome
to
win
her
and
a
smart
young
fellow
and
well
educated
like
our
friend
arthur
pendennis
was
quite
free
to
propose
for
her
if
he
had
a
mind
and
would
have
been
received
with
open
arms
by
lady
clavering
as
a
had
he
had
the
courage
to
come
forward
as
a
competitor
for
miss
amory
hand
mr
pen
however
besides
other
drawbacks
chose
to
entertain
an
extreme
diffidence
about
himself
he
was
ashamed
of
his
late
failures
of
his
idle
and
nameless
condition
of
the
poverty
which
he
had
brought
on
his
mother
by
his
folly
and
there
was
as
much
of
vanity
as
remorse
in
his
present
state
of
doubt
and
distrust
how
could
he
ever
hope
for
such
a
prize
as
this
brilliant
blanche
amory
who
lived
in
a
fine
park
and
mansion
and
was
waited
on
by
a
score
of
grand
domestics
whilst
a
brought
in
their
meagre
meal
at
fairoaks
and
his
mother
was
obliged
to
pinch
and
manage
to
make
both
ends
meet
obstacles
seemed
for
him
insurmountable
which
would
have
vanished
had
he
marched
manfully
upon
them
and
he
preferred
despairing
or
dallying
with
his
wishes
or
perhaps
he
had
not
positively
shaped
them
as
yet
to
attempting
to
win
gallantly
the
object
of
his
desire
many
a
young
man
fails
by
that
species
of
vanity
called
shyness
who
might
for
the
asking
have
his
will
but
we
do
not
pretend
to
say
that
pen
had
as
yet
ascertained
his
or
that
he
was
doing
much
more
than
thinking
about
falling
in
love
miss
amory
was
charming
and
lively
she
fascinated
and
cajoled
him
by
a
thousand
arts
or
natural
graces
or
flatteries
but
there
were
lurking
reasons
and
doubts
besides
shyness
and
vanity
withholding
him
in
spite
of
her
cleverness
and
her
protestations
and
her
fascinations
pen
mother
had
divined
the
girl
and
did
not
trust
her
pendennis
saw
blanche
and
frivolous
detected
many
wants
in
her
which
offended
the
pure
and
lady
a
want
of
reverence
for
her
parents
and
for
things
more
sacred
helen
thought
worldliness
and
selfishness
couched
under
pretty
words
and
tender
expressions
laura
and
pen
battled
these
points
strongly
at
first
with
the
widow
laura
being
as
yet
enthusiastic
about
her
new
friend
and
pen
not
enough
in
love
to
attempt
any
concealment
of
his
feelings
he
would
laugh
at
these
objections
of
helen
and
say
psha
mother
you
are
jealous
about
laura
all
women
are
but
when
in
the
course
of
a
month
or
two
and
by
watching
the
pair
with
that
anxiety
with
which
brooding
women
watch
over
their
affections
and
in
acknowledging
which
i
have
no
doubt
there
is
a
sexual
jealousy
on
the
mother
part
and
a
secret
pang
when
helen
saw
that
the
intimacy
appeared
to
make
progress
that
the
two
young
people
were
perpetually
finding
pretexts
to
meet
and
that
miss
blanche
was
at
fairoaks
or
mr
pen
at
the
park
every
day
the
poor
widow
heart
began
to
fail
her
her
darling
project
seemed
to
vanish
before
her
and
giving
way
to
her
weakness
she
fairly
told
pen
one
day
what
her
views
and
longings
were
that
she
felt
herself
breaking
and
not
long
for
this
world
and
that
she
hoped
and
prayed
before
she
went
that
she
might
see
her
two
children
one
the
late
events
pen
life
and
career
and
former
passion
for
the
actress
had
broken
the
spirit
of
this
tender
lady
she
felt
that
he
had
escaped
her
and
was
in
the
maternal
nest
no
more
and
she
clung
with
a
sickening
fondness
to
laura
laura
who
had
been
left
to
her
by
francis
in
heaven
pen
kissed
and
soothed
her
in
his
grand
patronising
way
he
had
seen
something
of
this
he
had
long
thought
his
mother
wanted
to
make
this
marriage
did
laura
know
anything
of
it
not
she
pendennis
said
not
for
worlds
would
she
have
breathed
a
word
of
it
to
laura
well
well
there
was
time
enough
his
mother
would
die
pen
said
laughingly
he
would
hear
of
any
such
thing
and
as
for
the
muse
she
is
too
grand
a
lady
to
think
about
poor
little
me
and
as
for
laura
who
knows
that
she
would
have
me
she
would
do
anything
you
told
her
to
be
sure
but
am
i
worthy
of
her
o
pen
you
might
be
was
the
widow
reply
not
that
mr
pen
ever
doubted
that
he
was
and
a
feeling
of
indefinable
pleasure
and
came
over
him
as
he
thought
over
this
proposal
and
imaged
laura
to
himself
as
his
memory
remembered
her
for
years
past
always
fair
and
open
kindly
and
pious
cheerful
tender
and
true
he
looked
at
her
with
brightening
eyes
as
she
came
in
from
the
garden
at
the
end
of
this
talk
her
cheeks
rather
flushed
her
looks
frank
and
smiling
a
basket
of
roses
in
her
hand
she
took
the
finest
of
them
and
brought
it
to
pendennis
who
was
refreshed
by
the
odour
and
colour
of
these
flowers
and
hung
over
her
fondly
and
gave
it
to
her
and
i
might
have
this
prize
for
the
asking
pen
thought
with
a
thrill
of
triumph
as
he
looked
at
the
kindly
girl
why
she
is
as
beautiful
and
as
generous
as
her
the
image
of
the
two
women
remained
for
ever
after
in
his
mind
and
he
never
recalled
it
but
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
before
very
many
weeks
intimacy
with
her
new
acquaintance
however
miss
laura
was
obliged
to
give
in
to
helen
opinion
and
own
that
the
muse
was
selfish
unkind
and
inconstant
of
course
blanche
confided
to
her
bosom
friend
all
the
little
griefs
and
domestic
annoyances
how
the
family
could
not
comprehend
her
and
she
moved
among
them
an
isolated
being
how
her
poor
mamma
education
had
been
neglected
and
she
was
forced
to
blush
for
her
blunders
how
sir
francis
was
a
weak
person
deplorably
unintellectual
and
only
happy
when
smoking
his
odious
cigars
how
since
the
birth
of
her
little
brother
she
had
seen
her
mother
precious
affection
which
she
valued
more
than
anything
in
life
estranged
from
her
once
darling
daughter
how
she
was
alone
alone
alone
in
the
world
but
these
griefs
real
and
though
they
might
be
to
a
young
lady
of
exquisite
sensibility
did
not
convince
laura
of
the
propriety
of
blanche
conduct
in
many
small
incidents
of
life
little
frank
for
instance
might
have
deprived
blanche
of
her
mamma
affection
but
this
was
no
reason
why
blanche
should
box
the
child
ears
because
he
upset
a
glass
of
water
over
her
drawing
and
why
she
should
call
him
many
opprobrious
names
in
the
english
and
french
language
and
the
preference
accorded
to
little
frank
was
certainly
no
reason
why
blanche
should
give
herself
imperial
airs
of
command
towards
the
governess
and
send
that
young
lady
upon
messages
through
the
house
to
bring
her
book
or
to
fetch
her
when
a
domestic
performed
an
errand
for
honest
laura
she
was
always
thankful
and
pleased
whereas
she
could
not
but
perceive
that
the
little
muse
had
not
the
slightest
scruple
in
giving
her
commands
to
all
the
world
round
about
her
and
in
disturbing
anybody
ease
or
comfort
in
order
to
administer
to
her
own
it
was
laura
first
experience
in
friendship
and
it
pained
the
kind
creature
heart
to
be
obliged
to
give
up
as
delusions
one
by
one
those
charms
and
brilliant
qualities
in
which
her
fancy
had
dressed
her
new
friend
and
to
find
that
the
fascinating
little
fairy
was
but
a
mortal
and
not
a
very
amiable
mortal
after
all
what
generous
person
is
there
that
has
not
been
so
deceived
in
his
time
what
person
perhaps
that
has
not
so
disappointed
others
in
his
turn
after
the
scene
with
little
frank
in
which
that
refractory
son
and
heir
of
the
house
of
clavering
had
received
the
compliments
in
french
and
english
and
the
accompanying
box
on
the
ear
from
his
sister
miss
laura
who
had
plenty
of
humour
could
not
help
calling
to
mind
some
very
touching
and
tender
verses
which
the
muse
had
read
to
her
out
of
mes
larmes
and
which
began
my
pretty
baby
brother
may
angels
guard
thy
rest
in
which
the
muse
after
complimenting
the
baby
upon
the
station
in
life
which
it
was
about
to
occupy
and
contrasting
it
with
her
own
lonely
condition
vowed
nevertheless
that
the
angel
boy
would
never
enjoy
such
affection
as
hers
was
or
find
in
the
false
world
before
him
anything
so
constant
and
tender
as
a
sister
heart
it
may
be
the
forlorn
one
said
it
may
be
you
will
slight
it
my
pretty
baby
sweet
you
will
spurn
me
from
your
bosom
i
cling
around
your
feet
o
let
me
let
me
love
you
the
world
will
prove
to
you
as
false
as
is
to
others
but
i
am
ever
and
behold
the
muse
was
boxing
the
darling
brother
ears
instead
of
kneeling
at
his
feet
and
giving
miss
laura
her
first
lesson
in
the
cynical
philosophy
not
quite
her
first
however
something
like
this
selfishness
and
waywardness
something
like
this
contrast
between
practice
and
poetry
between
grand
versified
aspirations
and
everyday
life
she
had
witnessed
at
home
in
the
person
of
our
young
friend
mr
pen
but
then
pen
was
different
pen
was
a
man
it
seemed
natural
somehow
that
he
should
be
and
should
have
his
own
way
and
under
his
waywardness
and
selfishness
indeed
there
was
a
kind
and
generous
heart
o
it
was
hard
that
such
a
diamond
should
be
changed
away
against
such
a
false
stone
as
this
in
a
word
laura
began
to
be
tired
of
her
admired
blanche
she
had
assayed
her
and
found
her
not
true
and
her
former
admiration
and
delight
which
she
had
expressed
with
her
accustomed
generous
artlessness
gave
way
to
a
feeling
which
we
shall
not
call
contempt
but
which
was
very
near
it
and
which
caused
laura
to
adopt
towards
miss
amory
a
grave
and
tranquil
tone
of
superiority
which
was
at
first
by
no
means
to
the
muse
liking
nobody
likes
to
be
found
out
or
having
held
a
high
place
to
submit
to
step
down
the
consciousness
that
this
event
was
impending
did
not
serve
to
increase
miss
blanche
and
as
it
made
her
peevish
and
dissatisfied
with
herself
it
probably
rendered
her
even
less
agreeable
to
the
persons
round
about
her
so
there
arose
one
fatal
day
a
between
dearest
blanche
and
dearest
laura
in
which
the
friendship
between
them
was
all
but
slain
outright
dearest
blanche
had
been
unusually
capricious
and
wicked
on
this
day
she
had
been
insolent
to
her
mother
savage
with
little
frank
odiously
impertinent
in
her
behaviour
to
the
boy
governess
and
intolerably
cruel
to
pincott
her
attendant
not
venturing
to
attack
her
friend
for
the
little
tyrant
was
of
a
timid
feline
nature
and
only
used
her
claws
upon
those
who
were
weaker
than
herself
she
maltreated
all
these
and
especially
poor
pincott
who
was
menial
confidante
companion
slave
always
according
to
the
caprice
of
her
young
mistress
this
girl
who
had
been
sitting
in
the
room
with
the
young
ladies
being
driven
thence
in
tears
occasioned
by
the
cruelty
of
her
mistress
and
raked
with
a
parting
sarcasm
as
she
went
sobbing
from
the
door
laura
fairly
broke
out
into
a
loud
and
indignant
invective
wondered
how
one
so
young
could
forget
the
deference
owing
to
her
elders
as
well
as
to
her
inferiors
in
station
and
professing
so
much
sensibility
of
her
own
could
torture
the
feelings
of
others
so
wantonly
laura
told
her
friend
that
her
conduct
was
absolutely
wicked
and
that
she
ought
to
ask
pardon
of
heaven
on
her
knees
for
it
and
having
delivered
herself
of
a
hot
and
voluble
speech
whereof
the
delivery
astonished
the
speaker
as
much
almost
as
her
auditor
she
ran
to
her
bonnet
and
shawl
and
went
home
across
the
park
in
a
great
flurry
and
perturbation
and
to
the
surprise
of
pendennis
who
had
not
expected
her
until
night
alone
with
helen
laura
gave
an
account
of
the
scene
and
gave
up
her
friend
henceforth
o
mamma
she
said
you
were
right
blanche
who
seems
so
soft
and
so
kind
is
as
you
have
said
selfish
and
cruel
she
who
is
always
speaking
of
her
affections
can
have
no
heart
no
honest
girl
would
afflict
a
mother
so
or
torture
a
dependant
and
and
i
give
her
up
from
this
day
and
i
will
have
no
other
friend
but
on
this
the
two
ladies
went
through
the
osculatory
ceremony
which
they
were
in
the
habit
of
performing
and
pendennis
got
a
great
secret
comfort
from
the
little
quarrel
for
laura
confession
seemed
to
say
that
girl
can
never
be
a
wife
for
pen
for
she
is
and
heartless
and
quite
unworthy
of
our
noble
hero
he
will
be
sure
to
find
out
her
unworthiness
for
his
own
part
and
then
he
will
be
saved
from
this
flighty
creature
and
awake
out
of
his
but
miss
laura
did
not
tell
pendennis
perhaps
did
not
acknowledge
to
herself
what
had
been
the
real
cause
of
the
day
quarrel
being
in
a
very
wicked
mood
and
bent
upon
mischief
everywhere
the
little
wicked
muse
of
a
blanche
had
very
soon
begun
her
tricks
her
darling
laura
had
come
to
pass
a
long
day
and
as
they
were
sitting
in
her
own
room
together
had
chosen
to
bring
the
conversation
round
to
the
subject
of
mr
pen
i
am
afraid
he
is
sadly
fickle
miss
blanche
observed
mrs
pybus
and
many
more
clavering
people
have
told
us
all
about
the
i
was
quite
a
child
when
it
happened
and
i
do
know
anything
about
it
laura
answered
blushing
very
much
he
used
her
very
ill
blanche
said
wagging
her
little
head
he
was
false
to
i
am
sure
he
was
not
laura
cried
out
he
acted
most
generously
by
her
he
wanted
to
give
up
everything
to
marry
her
it
was
she
that
was
false
to
him
he
nearly
broke
his
heart
about
it
he
i
thought
you
did
know
anything
about
the
story
dearest
interposed
miss
blanche
mamma
has
said
so
said
laura
well
he
is
very
clever
continued
the
other
little
dear
what
a
sweet
poet
he
is
have
you
ever
read
his
poems
only
the
and
the
diver
which
he
translated
for
us
and
his
prize
poem
which
did
get
the
prize
and
indeed
i
thought
it
very
pompous
and
prosy
laura
said
laughing
has
he
never
written
you
any
poems
then
love
asked
miss
amory
no
my
dear
said
miss
bell
blanche
ran
up
to
her
friend
kissed
her
fondly
called
her
my
dearest
laura
at
least
three
times
looked
her
archly
in
the
face
nodded
her
head
and
said
promise
to
tell
and
i
will
show
you
and
tripping
across
the
room
daintily
to
a
little
inlaid
desk
she
opened
it
with
a
silver
key
and
took
out
two
or
three
papers
crumpled
and
rather
stained
with
green
which
she
submitted
to
her
friend
laura
took
them
and
read
them
they
were
sure
enough
something
about
undine
about
a
naiad
about
a
river
she
looked
at
them
for
a
long
time
but
in
truth
the
lines
were
not
very
distinct
before
her
eyes
and
you
have
answered
them
blanche
she
asked
putting
them
back
o
no
not
for
worlds
dearest
the
other
said
and
when
her
dearest
laura
had
quite
done
with
the
verses
she
tripped
back
and
popped
them
again
into
the
pretty
desk
then
she
went
to
her
piano
and
sang
two
or
three
songs
of
rossini
whose
flourishes
of
music
her
flexible
little
voice
could
execute
to
perfection
and
laura
sate
by
vaguely
listening
as
she
performed
these
pieces
what
was
miss
bell
thinking
about
the
while
she
hardly
knew
but
sate
there
silent
as
the
songs
rolled
by
after
this
concert
the
young
ladies
were
summoned
to
the
room
where
luncheon
was
served
and
whither
they
of
course
went
with
their
arms
round
each
other
waists
and
it
could
not
have
been
jealousy
or
anger
on
laura
part
which
had
made
her
silent
for
after
they
had
tripped
along
the
corridor
and
descended
the
steps
and
were
about
to
open
the
door
which
leads
into
the
hall
laura
paused
and
looking
her
friend
kindly
and
frankly
in
the
face
kissed
her
with
a
sisterly
warmth
something
occurred
after
this
master
frank
manner
of
eating
probably
or
mamma
blunders
or
sir
francis
smelling
of
cigars
which
vexed
miss
blanche
and
she
gave
way
to
that
series
of
naughtinesses
whereof
we
have
spoken
and
which
ended
in
the
above
little
quarrel
chapter
xxvi
a
house
full
of
visitors
the
difference
between
the
girls
did
not
last
long
laura
was
always
too
eager
to
forgive
and
be
forgiven
and
as
for
miss
blanche
her
hostilities
never
very
long
or
durable
had
not
been
provoked
by
the
above
scene
nobody
cares
about
being
accused
of
wickedness
no
vanity
is
hurt
by
that
sort
of
charge
blanche
was
rather
pleased
than
provoked
by
her
friend
indignation
which
never
would
have
been
raised
but
for
a
cause
which
both
knew
though
neither
spoke
of
and
so
laura
with
a
sigh
was
obliged
to
confess
that
the
romantic
part
of
her
first
friendship
was
at
an
end
and
that
the
object
of
it
was
only
worthy
of
a
very
ordinary
sort
of
regard
as
for
blanche
she
instantly
composed
a
copy
of
touching
verses
setting
forth
her
desertion
and
disenchantment
it
was
only
the
old
story
she
wrote
of
love
meeting
with
coldness
and
fidelity
returned
by
neglect
and
some
new
neighbours
arriving
from
london
about
this
time
in
whose
family
there
were
daughters
miss
amory
had
the
advantage
of
selecting
an
eternal
friend
from
one
of
these
young
ladies
and
imparting
her
sorrows
and
disappointments
to
this
new
sister
the
tall
footmen
came
but
seldom
now
with
notes
to
the
sweet
laura
the
was
but
rarely
despatched
to
fairoaks
to
be
at
the
orders
of
the
ladies
there
blanche
adopted
a
sweet
look
of
suffering
martyrdom
when
laura
came
to
see
her
the
other
laughed
at
her
sentimental
mood
and
treated
it
with
a
that
was
by
no
means
respectful
but
if
miss
blanche
found
new
female
friends
to
console
her
the
faithful
historian
is
also
bound
to
say
that
she
discovered
some
acquaintances
of
the
other
sex
who
seemed
to
give
her
consolation
too
if
ever
this
artless
young
creature
met
a
young
man
and
had
ten
minutes
conversation
with
him
in
a
garden
walk
in
a
window
or
in
the
intervals
of
a
waltz
she
confided
in
him
so
to
speak
made
play
with
her
beautiful
eyes
spoke
in
a
tone
of
tender
interest
and
simple
and
touching
appeal
and
left
him
to
perform
the
same
pretty
little
drama
in
behalf
of
his
successor
when
the
claverings
first
came
down
to
the
park
there
were
very
few
audiences
before
whom
miss
blanche
could
perform
hence
pen
had
all
the
benefits
of
her
glances
and
confidences
and
the
window
or
the
garden
walk
all
to
himself
in
the
town
of
clavering
it
has
been
said
there
were
actually
no
young
men
in
the
near
surrounding
country
only
a
curate
or
two
or
a
rustic
young
squire
with
large
feet
and
clothes
to
the
dragoons
quartered
at
chatteris
the
baronet
made
no
overtures
it
was
unluckily
his
own
regiment
he
had
left
it
on
bad
terms
with
some
officers
of
the
corps
an
ugly
business
about
a
horse
bargain
a
disputed
play
account
a
white
feather
who
need
ask
it
is
not
our
business
to
inquire
too
closely
into
the
bygones
of
our
characters
except
in
so
far
as
their
previous
history
appertains
to
the
development
of
this
present
story
but
the
autumn
and
the
end
of
the
parliamentary
session
and
the
london
season
brought
one
or
two
county
families
down
to
their
houses
and
filled
tolerably
the
neighbouring
little
of
baymouth
and
opened
our
friend
bingley
theatre
royal
at
chatteris
and
collected
the
usual
company
at
the
assizes
and
there
up
to
this
time
the
old
county
families
had
been
rather
shy
of
our
friends
of
clavering
park
the
fogeys
of
drummington
the
squares
of
tozely
park
the
welbores
of
the
barrow
etc
all
sorts
of
stories
were
current
among
these
folks
regarding
the
family
at
clavering
indeed
nobody
ought
to
say
that
people
in
the
country
have
no
imagination
who
heard
them
talk
about
new
neighbours
about
sir
francis
and
his
lady
and
her
birth
and
parentage
about
miss
amory
about
captain
strong
there
had
been
endless
histories
which
need
not
be
recapitulated
and
the
family
of
the
park
had
been
three
months
in
the
county
before
the
great
people
around
began
to
call
but
at
the
end
of
the
season
the
earl
of
trehawk
lord
lieutenant
of
the
county
coming
to
eyrie
castle
and
the
countess
dowager
of
rockminster
whose
son
was
also
a
magnate
of
the
land
to
occupy
a
mansion
on
the
marine
parade
at
baymouth
these
great
folks
came
publicly
immediately
and
in
state
to
call
upon
the
family
of
clavering
park
and
the
carriages
of
the
county
families
speedily
followed
in
the
track
which
had
been
left
in
the
avenue
by
their
lordly
wheels
it
was
then
that
mirobolant
began
to
have
an
opportunity
of
exercising
that
skill
which
he
possessed
and
of
forgetting
in
the
occupations
of
his
art
the
pangs
of
love
it
was
then
that
the
large
footmen
were
too
much
employed
at
clavering
park
to
be
able
to
bring
messages
or
dally
over
the
cup
of
small
beer
with
the
poor
little
maids
at
fairoaks
it
was
then
that
blanche
found
other
dear
friends
than
laura
and
other
places
to
walk
in
besides
the
where
pen
was
fishing
he
came
day
after
day
and
whipped
the
stream
but
the
fish
fish
would
do
their
duty
nor
the
peri
appear
and
here
though
in
strict
confidence
and
with
a
request
that
the
matter
go
no
further
we
may
as
well
allude
to
a
delicate
business
of
which
previous
hint
has
been
given
mention
has
been
made
in
a
former
page
of
a
certain
hollow
tree
at
which
pen
used
to
take
his
station
when
engaged
in
his
passion
for
miss
fotheringay
and
the
cavity
of
which
he
afterwards
used
for
other
purposes
than
to
insert
his
baits
and
in
the
truth
is
he
converted
this
tree
into
a
under
a
piece
of
moss
and
a
stone
he
used
to
put
little
poems
or
letters
equally
poetical
which
were
addressed
to
a
certain
undine
or
naiad
who
frequented
the
stream
and
which
once
or
twice
were
replaced
by
a
receipt
in
the
shape
of
a
flower
or
by
a
modest
little
word
or
two
of
acknowledgment
written
in
a
delicate
hand
in
french
or
english
and
on
pink
scented
paper
certainly
miss
amory
used
to
walk
by
this
stream
as
we
have
seen
and
it
is
a
fact
that
she
used
pink
scented
paper
for
her
correspondence
but
after
the
great
folks
had
invaded
clavering
park
and
the
family
coach
passed
out
of
the
evening
after
evening
on
their
way
to
the
other
great
country
houses
nobody
came
to
fetch
pen
letters
at
the
the
white
paper
was
not
exchanged
for
the
pink
but
lay
undisturbed
under
its
stone
and
its
moss
whilst
the
tree
was
reflected
into
the
stream
and
the
brawl
went
rolling
by
there
was
not
much
in
the
letters
certainly
in
the
pink
notes
scarcely
anything
merely
a
little
word
or
two
half
jocular
half
sympathetic
such
as
might
be
written
by
any
young
lady
but
oh
you
silly
pendennis
if
you
wanted
this
one
why
did
you
not
speak
perhaps
neither
party
was
in
earnest
you
were
only
playing
at
being
in
love
and
the
sportive
little
undine
was
humouring
you
at
the
same
play
but
if
a
man
is
baulked
at
this
game
he
not
unfrequently
loses
his
temper
and
when
nobody
came
any
more
for
pen
poems
he
began
to
look
upon
those
compositions
in
a
very
serious
light
he
felt
almost
tragical
and
romantic
again
as
in
his
first
affair
of
the
heart
at
any
rate
he
was
bent
upon
having
an
explanation
one
day
he
went
to
the
hall
and
there
was
a
roomful
of
visitors
on
another
miss
amory
was
not
to
be
seen
she
was
going
to
a
ball
that
night
and
was
lying
down
to
take
a
little
sleep
pen
cursed
balls
and
the
narrowness
of
his
means
and
the
humility
of
his
position
in
the
country
that
caused
him
to
be
passed
over
by
the
givers
of
these
entertainments
on
a
third
occasion
miss
amory
was
in
the
garden
and
he
ran
thither
she
was
walking
there
in
state
with
no
less
personages
than
the
bishop
and
bishopess
of
chatteris
and
the
episcopal
family
who
scowled
at
him
and
drew
up
in
great
dignity
when
he
was
presented
to
them
and
they
heard
his
name
the
right
reverend
prelate
had
heard
it
before
and
also
of
the
little
transaction
in
the
dean
garden
the
bishop
says
you
a
sad
young
man
lady
clavering
whispered
to
him
what
have
you
been
a
doing
of
nothink
i
hope
to
vex
such
a
dear
mar
as
yours
how
is
your
dear
mar
why
do
she
come
and
me
we
a
seen
her
this
ever
such
a
time
we
a
goin
about
a
gaddin
so
that
we
do
see
no
neighbours
now
give
my
love
to
her
and
laurar
and
come
all
to
dinner
pendennis
was
too
unwell
to
come
out
but
laura
and
pen
came
and
there
was
a
great
party
and
pen
only
got
an
opportunity
of
a
hurried
word
with
miss
amory
you
never
come
to
the
river
now
he
said
i
ca
said
blanche
the
house
is
full
of
undine
has
left
the
stream
mr
pen
went
on
choosing
to
be
poetical
she
never
ought
to
have
gone
there
miss
amory
answered
she
wo
go
again
it
was
very
foolish
very
wrong
it
was
only
play
besides
you
have
other
consolations
at
home
she
added
looking
him
full
in
the
face
an
instant
and
dropping
her
eyes
if
he
wanted
her
why
did
he
not
speak
then
she
might
have
said
yes
even
then
but
as
she
spoke
of
other
consolations
at
home
he
thought
of
laura
so
affectionate
and
so
pure
and
of
his
mother
at
home
who
had
bent
her
fond
heart
upon
uniting
him
with
her
adopted
daughter
blanche
he
began
in
a
vexed
tone
miss
amory
laura
is
looking
at
us
pendennis
the
young
lady
said
i
must
go
back
to
the
company
and
she
ran
off
leaving
pendennis
to
bite
his
nails
in
perplexity
and
to
look
out
into
the
moonlight
in
the
garden
laura
indeed
was
looking
at
pen
she
was
talking
with
or
appearing
to
listen
to
the
talk
of
pynsent
lord
rockminster
son
and
grandson
of
the
dowager
lady
who
was
seated
in
state
in
the
place
of
honour
gravely
receiving
lady
clavering
bad
grammar
and
patronising
the
vacuous
sir
francis
whose
interest
in
the
county
she
was
desirous
to
secure
pynsent
and
pen
had
been
at
oxbridge
together
where
the
latter
during
his
heyday
of
good
fortune
and
fashion
had
been
the
superior
of
the
young
patrician
and
perhaps
rather
supercilious
towards
him
they
had
met
for
the
first
time
since
they
parted
at
the
university
at
the
table
and
given
each
other
that
exceedingly
impertinent
and
amusing
of
recognition
which
is
practised
in
england
only
and
only
to
perfection
by
university
men
and
which
seems
to
say
confound
you
what
do
you
do
here
i
knew
that
man
at
oxbridge
pynsent
said
to
miss
bell
a
pendennis
i
yes
said
miss
bell
he
seems
rather
sweet
upon
miss
amory
the
gentleman
went
on
laura
looked
at
them
and
perhaps
thought
so
too
but
said
nothing
a
man
of
large
property
in
the
county
ai
he
he
used
to
talk
about
representing
it
he
used
to
speak
at
the
union
whereabouts
do
his
estates
lie
laura
smiled
his
estates
lie
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
near
the
he
is
my
cousin
and
i
live
where
asked
pynsent
with
a
laugh
why
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
at
fairoaks
answered
miss
bell
many
pheasants
there
cover
looks
rather
good
said
the
simple
gentleman
laura
smiled
again
we
have
nine
hens
and
a
cock
a
pig
and
an
old
pendennis
do
preserve
then
continued
pynsent
you
should
come
and
see
him
the
girl
said
laughing
and
greatly
amused
at
the
notion
that
her
pen
was
a
great
county
gentleman
and
perhaps
had
given
himself
out
to
be
such
indeed
i
quite
long
to
renew
our
acquaintance
pynsent
said
gallantly
and
with
a
look
which
fairly
said
it
is
you
that
i
would
like
to
come
and
see
to
which
look
and
speech
miss
laura
vouchsafed
a
smile
and
made
a
little
bow
here
blanche
came
stepping
up
with
her
most
fascinating
smile
and
ogle
and
begged
dear
laura
to
come
and
take
the
second
in
a
song
laura
was
ready
to
do
anything
and
went
to
the
piano
by
which
pynsent
listened
as
long
as
the
duet
lasted
and
until
miss
amory
began
for
herself
when
he
strode
away
what
a
nice
frank
amiable
girl
that
is
wagg
said
pynsent
to
a
gentleman
who
had
come
over
with
him
from
baymouth
the
tall
one
i
mean
with
the
ringlets
and
red
lips
monstrous
red
they
what
do
you
think
of
the
girl
of
the
house
asked
wagg
i
think
she
a
lean
scraggy
humbug
said
pynsent
with
great
candour
she
drags
her
shoulders
out
of
her
dress
she
never
lets
her
eyes
alone
and
she
goes
simpering
and
ogling
about
like
a
french
pynsent
be
civil
cried
the
other
somebody
can
oh
it
pendennis
of
boniface
pynsent
said
fine
evening
pendennis
we
were
just
talking
of
your
charming
any
relation
to
my
old
friend
major
pendennis
asked
wagg
his
nephew
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
at
gaunt
house
mr
pen
said
with
his
very
best
air
the
acquaintance
between
the
gentlemen
was
made
in
an
instant
in
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
the
two
gentlemen
who
were
staying
at
clavering
park
were
found
by
mr
pen
on
his
return
from
a
fishing
excursion
in
which
he
had
no
sport
seated
in
his
mother
in
comfortable
conversation
with
the
widow
and
her
ward
pynsent
tall
and
gaunt
with
large
red
whiskers
and
an
imposing
tuft
to
his
chin
was
striding
over
a
chair
in
the
intimate
neighbourhood
of
miss
laura
she
was
amused
by
his
talk
which
was
simple
straightforward
rather
humorous
and
keen
and
interspersed
with
homely
expressions
of
a
style
which
is
sometimes
called
slang
it
was
the
first
specimen
of
a
young
london
dandy
that
laura
had
seen
or
heard
for
she
had
been
but
a
chit
at
the
time
of
foker
introduction
at
fairoaks
nor
indeed
was
that
ingenuous
gentleman
much
more
than
a
boy
and
his
refinement
was
only
that
of
a
school
and
college
wagg
as
he
entered
the
fairoaks
premises
with
his
companion
eyed
and
noted
everything
old
gardener
he
said
seeing
john
at
the
lodge
old
red
livery
waistcoat
clothes
hanging
out
to
dry
on
the
blue
aprons
white
ducks
gad
they
must
be
young
pendennis
white
ducks
nobody
else
wears
in
the
family
rather
a
shy
place
for
a
sucking
county
member
ay
pynsent
snug
little
crib
said
pynsent
pretty
cosy
little
mr
pendennis
at
home
old
gentleman
wagg
said
to
the
old
domestic
john
answered
no
master
pendennis
was
agone
are
the
ladies
at
home
asked
the
younger
visitor
john
answered
yes
they
be
and
as
the
pair
walked
over
the
trim
gravel
and
by
the
neat
shrubberies
up
the
steps
to
the
which
old
john
opened
wagg
noted
everything
that
he
saw
the
barometer
and
the
the
umbrellas
and
the
ladies
clogs
pen
hats
and
tartan
wrapper
and
old
john
opening
the
door
to
introduce
the
such
minutiae
attracted
wagg
instinctively
he
seized
them
in
spite
of
himself
old
fellow
does
all
the
work
he
whispered
to
pynsent
caleb
balderstone
should
wonder
if
he
the
the
next
minute
the
pair
were
in
the
presence
of
the
fairoaks
ladies
in
whom
pynsent
could
not
help
recognising
two
perfectly
ladies
and
to
whom
wagg
made
his
obeisance
with
florid
bows
and
extra
courtesy
accompanied
with
an
occasional
knowing
leer
at
his
companion
pynsent
did
not
choose
to
acknowledge
these
signals
except
by
extreme
haughtiness
towards
wagg
and
particular
deference
to
the
ladies
if
there
was
one
thing
laughable
in
wagg
eyes
it
was
poverty
he
had
the
soul
of
a
butler
who
had
been
brought
from
his
pantry
to
make
fun
in
the
his
jokes
were
plenty
and
his
thoroughly
genuine
but
he
did
not
seem
to
understand
that
a
gentleman
could
wear
an
old
coat
or
that
a
lady
could
be
respectable
unless
she
had
her
carriage
or
employed
a
french
milliner
charming
place
said
he
bowing
to
the
widow
noble
prospect
delightful
to
us
cocknies
who
seldom
see
anything
but
pall
the
widow
said
simply
she
had
never
been
in
london
but
once
in
her
life
before
her
son
was
born
fine
village
fine
village
said
wagg
and
increasing
every
day
it
be
quite
a
large
town
soon
it
not
a
bad
place
to
live
in
for
those
who
ca
get
the
country
and
will
repay
a
visit
when
you
honour
my
brother
major
pendennis
has
often
mentioned
your
name
to
us
the
widow
said
and
we
have
been
very
much
amused
by
some
of
your
droll
books
sir
helen
continued
who
never
could
be
brought
to
like
wagg
books
and
detested
their
tone
most
thoroughly
he
is
my
very
good
friend
wagg
said
with
a
low
bow
and
one
of
the
best
known
men
about
town
and
where
known
appreciated
i
assure
you
appreciated
he
is
with
our
friend
steyne
at
steyne
has
a
touch
of
the
gout
and
so
between
ourselves
has
your
brother
i
am
going
to
stillbrook
for
the
and
afterwards
to
bareacres
where
pendennis
and
i
shall
probably
meet
and
he
poured
out
a
flood
of
fashionable
talk
introducing
the
names
of
a
score
of
peers
and
rattling
on
with
breathless
spirits
whilst
the
simple
widow
listened
in
silent
wonder
what
a
man
she
thought
are
all
the
men
of
fashion
in
london
like
this
i
am
sure
pen
will
never
like
him
pynsent
was
in
the
meanwhile
engaged
with
miss
laura
he
named
some
of
the
houses
in
the
neighbourhood
whither
he
was
going
and
hoped
very
much
that
he
should
see
miss
bell
at
some
of
them
he
hoped
that
her
aunt
would
give
her
a
season
in
london
he
said
that
in
the
next
parliament
it
was
probable
that
he
should
canvass
the
county
and
he
hoped
to
get
pendennis
interest
here
he
spoke
of
pen
triumph
as
an
orator
at
oxbridge
and
asked
was
he
coming
into
parliament
too
he
talked
on
very
pleasantly
and
greatly
to
laura
satisfaction
until
pen
himself
appeared
and
as
has
been
said
found
these
gentlemen
pen
behaved
very
courteously
to
the
pair
now
that
they
have
found
their
way
into
his
quarters
and
though
he
recollected
with
some
twinges
a
conversation
at
oxbridge
when
pynsent
was
present
and
in
which
after
a
great
debate
at
the
union
and
in
the
midst
of
considerable
excitement
produced
by
a
supper
and
he
had
announced
his
intention
of
coming
in
for
his
native
county
and
had
absolutely
returned
thanks
in
a
fine
speech
as
the
future
member
yet
pynsent
manner
was
so
frank
and
cordial
that
pen
hoped
pynsent
might
have
forgotten
his
little
fanfaronnade
and
any
other
braggadocio
speeches
or
actions
which
he
might
have
made
he
suited
himself
to
the
tone
of
the
visitors
then
and
talked
about
plinlimmon
and
magnus
charters
and
the
old
set
at
oxbridge
with
careless
familiarity
and
ease
as
if
he
lived
with
marquises
every
day
and
a
duke
was
no
more
to
him
than
a
village
curate
but
at
this
juncture
and
it
being
then
six
in
the
evening
betsy
the
maid
who
did
not
know
of
the
advent
of
strangers
walked
into
the
room
without
any
preliminary
but
that
of
flinging
the
door
wide
open
before
her
and
bearing
in
her
arms
a
tray
containing
three
a
and
a
plate
of
thick
all
splendour
and
magnificence
vanished
away
at
this
and
he
faltered
and
became
quite
abashed
what
will
they
think
of
us
he
thought
and
indeed
wagg
thrust
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
thought
the
tea
infinitely
contemptible
and
leered
and
winked
at
pynsent
to
that
effect
but
to
pynsent
the
transaction
appeared
perfectly
simple
there
was
no
reason
present
to
his
mind
why
people
should
not
drink
tea
at
six
if
they
were
minded
as
well
as
at
any
other
hour
and
he
asked
of
wagg
when
they
went
away
what
the
devil
he
was
grinning
and
winking
at
and
what
amused
him
did
you
see
how
the
cub
was
ashamed
of
the
thick
i
dare
say
they
going
to
have
treacle
if
they
are
good
i
take
an
opportunity
of
telling
old
pendennis
when
we
get
back
to
town
wagg
chuckled
out
do
see
the
fun
said
pynsent
never
thought
you
did
growled
wagg
between
his
teeth
they
walked
home
rather
sulkily
wagg
told
the
story
at
dinner
very
smartly
with
wonderful
accuracy
of
observation
he
described
old
john
the
clothes
that
were
drying
the
clogs
in
the
hall
the
and
its
furniture
and
pictures
old
man
with
a
beak
and
bald
head
feu
pendennis
i
bet
two
to
one
of
a
youth
in
a
cap
and
gown
the
present
marquis
of
fairoaks
of
course
the
widow
when
young
in
a
miniature
mee
she
had
the
gown
on
when
we
came
or
a
dress
made
the
year
after
and
the
tips
cut
off
the
fingers
of
her
gloves
which
she
stitches
her
son
collars
with
and
then
the
sarving
maid
came
in
with
their
teas
so
we
left
the
earl
and
the
countess
to
their
blanche
near
whom
he
sate
as
he
told
this
story
and
who
adored
les
hommes
desprit
burst
out
laughing
and
called
him
such
an
odd
droll
creature
but
pynsent
who
began
to
be
utterly
disgusted
with
him
broke
out
in
a
loud
voice
and
said
i
do
know
wagg
what
sort
of
ladies
you
are
accustomed
to
meet
in
your
own
family
but
by
gad
as
far
as
a
first
acquaintance
can
show
i
never
met
two
women
in
my
life
and
i
hope
you
call
upon
he
added
addressing
lady
rockminster
who
was
seated
at
sir
francis
clavering
right
hand
sir
francis
turned
to
the
guest
on
his
left
and
whispered
what
i
call
a
sticker
for
and
lady
clavering
giving
the
young
gentleman
a
delighted
tap
with
her
fan
winked
her
black
eyes
at
him
and
said
mr
pynsent
you
a
good
after
the
affair
with
blanche
a
difference
ever
so
slight
a
tone
of
melancholy
perhaps
a
little
bitter
might
be
perceived
in
converse
with
her
cousin
she
seemed
to
weigh
him
and
find
him
wanting
too
the
widow
saw
the
girl
clear
and
honest
eyes
watching
the
young
man
at
times
and
a
look
of
almost
scorn
pass
over
her
face
as
he
lounged
in
the
room
with
the
women
or
lazily
sauntered
smoking
upon
the
lawn
or
lolled
under
a
tree
there
over
a
book
which
he
was
too
listless
to
read
what
has
happened
between
you
helen
asked
of
the
girl
something
has
happened
has
that
wicked
little
blanche
been
making
mischief
tell
me
nothing
has
happened
at
all
laura
said
then
why
do
you
look
at
pen
so
asked
his
mother
quickly
look
at
him
dear
mother
said
the
girl
we
two
women
are
no
society
for
him
we
do
interest
him
we
are
not
clever
enough
for
such
a
genius
as
pen
he
wastes
his
life
and
energies
away
among
us
tied
to
our
he
interests
himself
in
nothing
he
scarcely
cares
to
go
beyond
the
even
captain
glanders
and
captain
strong
pall
upon
him
she
added
with
a
bitter
laugh
and
they
are
men
you
know
and
our
superiors
he
will
never
be
happy
while
he
is
here
why
is
he
not
facing
the
world
and
without
a
profession
we
have
got
enough
with
great
economy
said
the
widow
her
heart
beginning
to
beat
violently
pen
has
spent
nothing
for
months
i
sure
he
is
very
good
i
am
sure
he
might
be
very
happy
with
do
agitate
yourself
so
dear
mother
the
girl
answered
i
like
to
see
you
so
you
should
not
be
sad
because
pen
is
unhappy
here
all
men
are
so
they
must
work
they
must
make
themselves
names
and
a
place
in
the
world
look
the
two
captains
have
fought
and
seen
battles
that
pynsent
who
came
here
and
who
will
be
very
rich
is
in
a
public
office
he
works
very
hard
he
aspires
to
a
name
and
a
reputation
he
says
pen
was
one
of
the
best
speakers
at
oxbridge
and
had
as
great
a
character
for
talent
as
any
of
the
young
gentlemen
there
pen
himself
laughs
at
wagg
celebrity
and
indeed
he
is
a
horrid
person
and
says
he
is
a
dunce
and
that
anybody
could
write
his
i
am
sure
they
are
odious
and
vulgar
interposed
the
widow
yet
he
has
a
you
see
the
county
chronicle
says
celebrated
wagg
has
been
sojourning
at
baymouth
let
our
fashionables
and
eccentrics
look
out
for
something
from
his
caustic
pen
if
pen
can
write
better
than
this
gentleman
and
speak
better
than
pynsent
why
does
he
mamma
he
ca
make
speeches
to
us
or
distinguish
himself
here
he
ought
to
go
away
indeed
he
dear
laura
said
helen
taking
the
girl
hand
is
it
kind
of
you
to
hurry
him
so
i
have
been
waiting
i
have
been
saving
up
money
these
many
months
to
to
pay
back
your
advance
to
hush
mother
laura
cried
embracing
her
friend
hastily
it
was
your
money
not
mine
never
speak
about
that
again
how
much
money
have
you
saved
helen
said
there
were
more
than
two
hundred
pounds
at
the
bank
and
that
she
would
be
enabled
to
pay
off
all
laura
money
by
the
end
of
the
next
year
give
it
him
let
him
have
the
two
hundred
pounds
let
him
go
to
london
and
be
a
lawyer
be
something
be
worthy
of
his
mother
and
of
mine
dearest
mamma
said
the
good
girl
upon
which
and
with
her
usual
tenderness
and
emotion
the
fond
widow
declared
that
laura
was
a
blessing
to
her
and
the
best
of
girls
and
i
hope
no
one
in
this
instance
will
be
disposed
to
contradict
her
the
widow
and
her
daughter
had
more
than
one
conversation
on
this
subject
and
the
elder
gave
way
to
the
superior
reason
of
the
honest
and
girl
and
indeed
whenever
there
was
a
sacrifice
to
be
made
on
her
part
this
kind
lady
was
only
too
eager
to
make
it
but
she
took
her
own
way
and
did
not
loose
sight
of
the
end
she
had
in
view
in
imparting
these
new
plans
to
pen
one
day
she
told
him
of
these
projects
and
it
who
it
was
that
had
formed
them
how
it
was
laura
who
insisted
upon
his
going
to
london
and
studying
how
it
was
laura
who
would
not
hear
of
the
the
money
arrangements
when
he
came
back
from
oxbridge
being
settled
just
then
how
it
was
laura
whom
he
had
to
thank
if
indeed
he
thought
that
he
had
to
go
at
that
news
pen
countenance
blazed
up
with
pleasure
and
he
hugged
his
mother
to
his
heart
with
an
ardour
that
i
fear
disappointed
the
fond
lady
but
she
rallied
when
he
said
by
heaven
she
is
a
noble
girl
and
may
god
almighty
bless
her
mother
i
have
been
wearing
myself
away
for
months
here
longing
to
work
and
not
knowing
how
i
been
fretting
over
the
thoughts
of
my
shame
and
my
debts
and
my
past
cursed
extravagance
and
follies
i
suffered
infernally
my
heart
has
been
half
broken
never
mind
about
that
if
i
can
get
a
chance
to
redeem
the
past
and
to
do
my
duty
to
myself
and
the
best
mother
in
the
world
indeed
indeed
i
will
i
be
worthy
of
you
yet
heaven
bless
you
god
bless
laura
why
is
she
here
that
i
may
go
and
thank
her
pen
went
on
with
more
incoherent
phrases
paced
up
and
down
the
room
drank
glasses
of
water
jumped
about
his
mother
with
a
thousand
embraces
began
to
laugh
began
to
sing
was
happier
than
she
had
seen
him
since
he
was
a
boy
since
he
had
tasted
of
the
fruit
of
that
awful
tree
of
life
which
from
the
beginning
has
tempted
all
mankind
laura
was
not
at
home
laura
was
on
a
visit
to
the
stately
lady
rockminster
daughter
to
my
lord
bareacres
sister
to
the
late
lady
pontypool
and
by
consequence
a
distant
kinswoman
of
helen
as
her
ladyship
who
was
deeply
versed
in
genealogy
was
graciously
to
point
out
to
the
modest
country
lady
mr
pen
was
greatly
delighted
at
the
relationship
being
acknowledged
though
perhaps
not
over
well
pleased
that
lady
rockminster
took
miss
bell
home
with
her
for
a
couple
of
days
to
baymouth
and
did
not
make
the
slightest
invitation
to
arthur
pendennis
there
was
to
be
a
ball
at
baymouth
and
it
was
to
be
miss
laura
first
appearance
the
dowager
came
to
fetch
her
in
her
carriage
and
she
went
off
with
a
white
dress
in
her
box
happy
and
blushing
like
the
rose
to
which
pen
compared
her
this
was
the
night
of
the
ball
a
public
entertainment
at
the
baymouth
hotel
by
jove
said
pen
i
ride
over
no
i
wo
ride
but
go
his
mother
was
charmed
that
he
should
do
so
and
as
he
was
debating
about
the
conveyance
in
which
he
should
start
for
baymouth
captain
strong
called
opportunely
said
he
was
going
himself
and
that
he
would
put
his
horse
the
butcher
boy
into
the
gig
and
drive
pen
over
when
the
grand
company
began
to
fill
the
house
at
clavering
park
the
chevalier
strong
who
as
his
patron
said
was
never
in
the
way
or
out
of
it
seldom
intruded
himself
upon
its
society
but
went
elsewhere
to
seek
his
relaxation
i
seen
plenty
of
grand
dinners
in
my
time
he
said
and
dined
by
jove
in
a
company
where
there
was
a
king
and
royal
duke
at
top
and
bottom
and
every
man
along
the
table
had
six
stars
on
his
coat
but
dammy
glanders
this
finery
do
suit
me
and
the
english
ladies

is
removed
and
when
i
thirsty
have
my
beer
in
its
native
so
on
a
at
clavering
park
the
chevalier
would
content
himself
with
superintending
the
arrangements
of
the
table
and
drilling
the
and
servants
and
having
looked
over
the
with
monsieur
mirobolant
would
not
care
to
take
the
least
part
in
the
banquet
send
me
up
a
cutlet
and
a
bottle
of
claret
to
my
room
this
philosopher
would
say
and
from
the
windows
of
that
apartment
which
commanded
the
terrace
and
avenue
he
would
survey
the
company
as
they
arrived
in
their
carriages
or
take
a
peep
at
the
ladies
in
the
hall
through
an
which
commanded
it
from
his
corridor
and
the
guests
being
seated
strong
would
cross
the
park
to
captain
cottage
at
clavering
or
to
pay
the
landlady
a
visit
at
the
clavering
arms
or
to
drop
in
upon
madame
fribsby
over
her
novel
and
tea
wherever
the
chevalier
went
he
was
welcome
and
whenever
he
came
away
a
smell
of
hot
lingered
behind
him
the
butcher
boy
not
the
worst
horse
in
sir
francis
stable
was
appropriated
to
captain
strong
express
use
and
the
old
campaigner
saddled
him
or
brought
him
home
at
all
hours
of
the
day
or
night
and
drove
or
rode
him
up
and
down
the
country
where
there
was
a
with
a
good
tap
of
beer
where
there
was
a
tenant
with
a
pretty
daughter
who
played
on
the
piano
to
chatteris
to
the
play
or
the
barracks
to
baymouth
if
any
fun
was
on
foot
there
to
the
rural
fairs
or
races
the
chevalier
and
his
brown
horse
made
their
way
continually
and
this
worthy
gentleman
lived
at
free
quarters
in
a
friendly
country
the
butcher
boy
soon
took
pen
and
the
chevalier
to
baymouth
the
latter
was
as
familiar
with
the
hotel
and
landlord
there
as
with
every
other
inn
round
about
and
having
been
accommodated
with
a
bedroom
to
dress
they
entered
the
ballroom
the
chevalier
was
splendid
he
wore
three
little
gold
crosses
in
a
brochette
on
the
portly
breast
of
his
blue
coat
and
looked
like
a
foreign
the
ball
was
public
and
all
sorts
of
persons
were
admitted
and
encouraged
to
come
young
pynsent
having
views
upon
the
county
and
lady
rockminster
being
patroness
of
the
ball
there
was
a
quadrille
for
the
aristocracy
at
one
end
and
select
benches
for
the
people
of
fashion
towards
this
end
the
chevalier
did
not
care
to
penetrate
far
as
he
said
he
did
not
care
for
the
nobs
but
in
the
other
part
of
the
room
he
knew
everybody
the
innkeepers
tradesmen
solicitors
daughters
their
sires
and
brothers
and
plunged
about
shaking
hands
who
is
that
man
with
the
blue
ribbon
and
the
star
asked
pen
a
gentleman
in
black
with
ringlets
and
a
tuft
stood
gazing
fiercely
about
him
with
one
hand
in
the
of
his
waistcoat
and
the
other
holding
his
claque
by
jupiter
it
mirobolant
cried

dyed
evidently
with
the
purple
of

with
twinkling
eyes
and
white
eyelashes
and
a
thousand
wrinkles
in
his

which
was
of
a
strange
red
colour
with
two
and
large
gloves
and
hands
and
a
profusion
of
diamonds
and
jewels
in

into

arthur
pendennis
chose
to
assume
a
very
gloomy
and
frowning
countenance
and
to
watch
miss
bell
dance
her
first
quadrille
with
pynsent
for
a
partner
that
gentleman
was
as
solemn
and
severe
as
englishmen
are
upon
such
occasions
and
walked
through
the
dance
as
he
would
have
walked
up
to
his
pew
in
church
without
a
smile
upon
his
face
or
allowing
any
outward
circumstance
to
interfere
with
his
attention
to
the
grave
duty
in
which
he
was
engaged
but
miss
laura
face
was
beaming
with
pleasure
and
the
lights
and
the
crowd
and
music
excited
her
as
she
spread
out
her
white
robes
and
performed
her
part
of
the
dance
smiling
and
happy
her
brown
ringlets
flowing
back
over
her
fair
shoulders
from
her
honest
rosy
face
more
than
one
gentleman
in
the
room
admired
and
looked
after
her
and
lady
fogey
who
had
a
house
in
london
and
gave
herself
no
small
airs
of
fashion
when
in
the
country
asked
of
lady
rockminster
who
the
young
person
was
mentioned
a
reigning
beauty
in
london
whom
in
her
ladyship
opinion
laura
was
rather
like
and
pronounced
that
she
would
lady
rockminster
would
have
been
very
much
surprised
if
any
protegee
of
hers
would
not
do
and
wondered
at
lady
fogey
impudence
in
judging
upon
the
point
at
all
she
surveyed
laura
with
majestic
glances
through
her
eyeglass
she
was
pleased
with
the
girl
artless
looks
and
gay
innocent
manner
her
manner
is
very
good
her
ladyship
thought
her
arms
are
rather
red
but
that
is
a
defect
of
her
youth
her
tone
is
far
better
than
that
of
the
little
pert
miss
amory
who
is
dancing
opposite
to
her
miss
blanche
was
indeed
the
of
miss
laura
and
smiled
most
killingly
upon
her
dearest
friend
and
nodded
to
her
and
talked
to
her
when
they
met
during
the
quadrille
evolutions
and
patronised
her
a
great
deal
her
shoulders
were
the
whitest
in
the
whole
room
and
they
were
never
easy
in
her
frock
for
one
single
instant
nor
were
her
eyes
which
rolled
about
incessantly
nor
was
her
little
figure
it
seemed
to
say
to
all
the
people
come
and
look
at
me
not
at
that
pink
healthy
bouncing
country
lass
miss
bell
who
scarcely
knew
how
to
dance
till
i
taught
her
this
is
the
true
parisian
manner
this
is
the
prettiest
little
foot
in
the
room
and
the
prettiest
little
chaussure
too
look
at
it
pynsent
look
at
it
pendennis
you
who
are
scowling
behind
the
curtain
i
know
you
are
longing
to
dance
with
laura
went
on
dancing
and
keeping
an
attentive
eye
upon
mr
pen
in
the
embrasure
of
the
window
he
did
not
quit
that
retirement
during
the
first
quadrille
nor
until
the
second
when
the
lady
clavering
beckoned
to
him
to
come
up
to
her
to
the
dais
or
place
of
honour
where
the
dowagers
were
and
whither
pen
went
blushing
and
exceedingly
awkward
as
most
conceited
young
fellows
are
he
performed
a
haughty
salutation
to
lady
rockminster
who
hardly
acknowledged
his
bow
and
then
went
and
paid
his
respects
to
the
widow
of
the
late
amory
who
was
splendid
in
diamonds
velvet
lace
feathers
and
all
sorts
of
millinery
and
goldsmith
ware
young
fogey
then
in
the
fifth
form
at
eton
and
ardently
expecting
his
beard
and
his
commission
in
a
dragoon
regiment
was
the
second
partner
who
was
honoured
with
miss
bell
hand
he
was
rapt
in
admiration
of
that
young
lady
he
thought
he
had
never
seen
so
charming
a
creature
i
like
you
much
better
than
the
french
girl
for
this
young
gentleman
had
been
dancing
with
miss
amory
before
he
candidly
said
to
her
laura
laughed
and
looked
more
than
ever
and
in
the
midst
of
her
laughter
caught
a
sight
of
pen
and
continued
to
laugh
as
he
on
his
side
continued
to
look
absurdly
pompous
and
sulky
the
next
dance
was
a
waltz
and
young
fogey
thought
with
a
sigh
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
waltz
and
vowed
he
would
have
a
master
the
next
holidays
pynsent
again
claimed
miss
bell
hand
for
this
dance
and
pen
beheld
her
in
a
fury
twirling
round
the
room
her
waist
encircled
by
the
arm
of
that
gentleman
he
never
used
to
be
angry
before
when
on
summer
evenings
the
chairs
and
tables
being
removed
and
the
governess
called
downstairs
to
play
the
piano
he
and
the
chevalier
strong
who
was
a
splendid
performer
and
could
dance
a
british
hornpipe
a
german
waltz
or
a
spanish
fandango
if
need
were
and
the
two
young
ladies
blanche
and
laura
improvised
little
balls
at
clavering
park
laura
enjoyed
this
dancing
so
much
and
was
so
animated
that
she
even
animated
pynsent
blanche
who
could
dance
beautifully
had
an
unlucky
partner
captain
broadfoot
of
the
dragoons
then
stationed
at
chatteris
for
captain
broadfoot
though
devoting
himself
with
great
energy
to
the
object
in
view
could
not
get
round
in
time
and
not
having
the
least
ear
for
music
was
unaware
that
his
movements
were
too
slow
so
in
the
waltz
as
in
the
quadrille
miss
blanche
saw
that
her
dear
friend
laura
had
the
honours
of
the
dance
and
was
by
no
means
pleased
with
the
latter
success
after
a
couple
of
turns
with
the
heavy
dragoon
she
pleaded
fatigue
and
requested
to
be
led
back
to
her
place
near
her
mamma
to
whom
pen
was
talking
and
she
asked
him
why
he
had
not
asked
her
to
waltz
and
had
left
her
for
the
mercies
of
that
great
odious
man
in
spurs
and
a
red
coat
i
thought
spurs
and
scarlet
were
the
most
fascinating
objects
in
the
world
to
young
ladies
pen
answered
i
never
should
have
dared
to
put
my
black
coat
in
competition
with
that
splendid
red
you
are
very
unkind
and
cruel
and
sulky
and
naughty
said
miss
amory
with
another
shrug
of
the
shoulders
you
had
better
go
away
your
cousin
is
looking
at
us
over
pynsent
will
you
waltz
with
me
said
pen
not
this
waltz
i
ca
having
just
sent
away
that
good
captain
broadfoot
look
at
pynsent
did
you
ever
see
such
a
creature
but
i
will
dance
the
next
waltz
with
you
and
the
quadrille
too
i
am
promised
but
i
will
tell
poole
that
i
had
forgotten
my
engagement
to
women
forget
very
readily
pendennis
said
but
they
always
come
back
and
are
very
repentant
and
sorry
for
what
they
done
blanche
said
see
here
comes
the
poker
and
dear
laura
leaning
on
him
how
pretty
she
looks
laura
came
up
and
put
out
her
hand
to
pen
to
whom
pynsent
made
a
sort
of
bow
appearing
to
be
not
much
more
graceful
than
that
domestic
instrument
to
which
miss
amory
compared
him
but
laura
face
was
full
of
kindness
i
am
so
glad
to
have
come
dear
pen
she
said
i
can
speak
to
you
now
how
is
mamma
the
three
dances
are
over
and
i
am
engaged
to
you
for
the
next
i
have
just
engaged
myself
to
miss
amory
said
pen
and
miss
amory
nodded
her
head
and
made
her
usual
little
curtsey
i
do
intend
to
give
him
up
dearest
laura
she
said
well
then
he
waltz
with
me
dear
blanche
said
the
other
you
pen
i
promised
to
waltz
with
miss
provoking
said
laura
and
making
a
curtsey
in
her
turn
she
went
and
placed
herself
under
the
ample
wing
of
lady
rockminster
pen
was
delighted
with
his
mischief
the
two
prettiest
girls
in
the
room
were
quarrelling
about
him
he
flattered
himself
he
had
punished
miss
laura
he
leaned
in
a
dandified
air
with
his
elbow
over
the
wall
and
talked
to
blanche
he
quizzed
unmercifully
all
the
men
in
the
room
the
heavy
dragoons
in
their
tight
jackets
the
country
dandies
in
their
queer
attire
the
strange
toilettes
of
the
ladies
one
seemed
to
have
a
bird
nest
in
her
head
another
had
six
pounds
of
grapes
in
her
hair
besides
her
false
pearls
it
a
coiffure
of
almonds
and
raisins
said
pen
and
might
be
served
up
for
in
a
word
he
was
exceedingly
satirical
and
amusing
during
the
quadrille
he
carried
on
this
kind
of
conversation
with
unflinching
bitterness
and
vivacity
and
kept
blanche
continually
laughing
both
at
his
wickedness
and
jokes
which
were
good
and
also
because
laura
was
again
their
and
could
see
and
hear
how
merry
and
confidential
they
were
arthur
is
charming
she
whispered
to
laura
across
cornet
perch
as
pen
was
performing
cavalier
seul
before
them
drawling
through
that
figure
with
a
thumb
in
the
pocket
of
each
waistcoat
who
said
laura
arthur
answered
blanche
in
french
oh
it
such
a
pretty
name
and
now
the
young
ladies
went
over
to
pen
side
and
cornet
perch
performed
a
pas
seul
in
his
turn
he
had
no
waistcoat
pocket
to
put
his
hands
into
and
they
looked
large
and
swollen
as
they
hung
before
him
depending
from
the
tight
arms
in
the
jacket
during
the
interval
between
the
quadrille
and
the
succeeding
waltz
pen
did
not
take
any
notice
of
laura
except
to
ask
her
whether
her
partner
cornet
perch
was
an
amusing
youth
and
whether
she
liked
him
so
well
as
her
other
partner
pynsent
having
planted
which
two
daggers
in
laura
gentle
bosom
pendennis
proceeded
to
rattle
on
with
blanche
amory
and
to
make
jokes
good
or
bad
but
which
were
always
loud
laura
was
at
a
loss
to
account
for
her
cousin
sulky
behaviour
and
ignorant
in
what
she
had
offended
him
however
she
was
not
angry
in
her
turn
at
pen
splenetic
mood
for
she
was
the
most
and
forgiving
of
women
and
besides
an
exhibition
of
jealousy
on
a
man
part
is
not
always
disagreeable
to
a
lady
as
pen
would
not
dance
with
her
she
was
glad
to
take
up
with
the
active
chevalier
strong
who
was
a
still
better
performer
than
pen
and
being
very
fond
of
dancing
as
every
brisk
and
innocent
young
girl
should
be
when
the
waltz
music
began
she
set
off
and
chose
to
enjoy
herself
with
all
her
heart
captain
broadfoot
on
this
occasion
occupied
the
floor
in
conjunction
with
a
lady
of
proportions
scarcely
inferior
to
his
own
miss
roundle
a
large
young
woman
in
a
coloured
crape
dress
the
daughter
of
the
lady
with
the
grapes
in
her
head
whose
bunches
pen
had
admired
and
now
taking
his
time
and
with
his
fair
partner
blanche
hanging
lovingly
on
the
arm
which
encircled
her
arthur
pendennis
set
out
upon
his
waltzing
career
and
felt
as
he
whirled
round
to
the
music
that
he
and
blanche
were
performing
very
brilliantly
indeed
very
likely
he
looked
to
see
if
miss
bell
thought
so
too
but
she
did
not
or
would
not
see
him
and
was
always
engaged
with
her
partner
captain
strong
but
pen
triumph
was
not
destined
to
last
long
and
it
was
doomed
that
poor
blanche
was
to
have
yet
another
discomfiture
on
that
unfortunate
night
while
she
and
pen
were
whirling
round
as
light
and
brisk
as
a
couple
of
honest
captain
broadfoot
and
the
lady
round
whose
large
waist
he
was
clinging
were
twisting
round
very
leisurely
according
to
their
natures
and
indeed
were
in
everybody
way
but
they
were
more
in
pendennis
way
than
in
anybody
else
for
he
and
blanche
whilst
executing
their
rapid
gyrations
came
bolt
up
against
the
heavy
dragoon
and
his
lady
and
with
such
force
that
the
centre
of
gravity
was
lost
by
all
four
of
the
circumvolving
bodies
captain
broadfoot
and
miss
roundle
were
fairly
upset
as
was
pen
himself
who
was
less
lucky
than
his
partner
miss
amory
who
was
only
thrown
upon
a
bench
against
a
wall
but
pendennis
came
fairly
down
upon
the
floor
sprawling
in
the
general
ruin
with
broadfoot
and
miss
roundle
the
captain
though
heavy
was
and
was
the
first
to
burst
out
into
a
loud
laugh
at
his
own
misfortune
which
nobody
therefore
heeded
but
miss
amory
was
savage
at
her
mishap
miss
roundle
placed
on
her
seant
and
looking
pitifully
round
presented
an
object
which
very
few
people
could
see
without
laughing
and
pen
was
furious
when
he
heard
the
people
giggling
about
him
he
was
one
of
those
sarcastic
young
fellows
that
did
not
bear
a
laugh
at
his
own
expense
and
of
all
things
in
the
world
feared
ridicule
most
as
he
got
up
laura
and
strong
were
laughing
at
him
everybody
was
laughing
pynsent
and
his
partner
were
laughing
and
pen
boiled
with
wrath
against
the
pair
and
could
have
stabbed
them
both
on
the
spot
he
turned
away
in
a
fury
from
them
and
began
blundering
out
apologies
to
miss
amory
it
was
the
other
couple
fault
the
woman
in
pink
had
done
it
pen
hoped
miss
amory
was
not
hurt
would
she
not
have
the
courage
to
take
another
turn
miss
amory
in
a
pet
said
she
was
very
much
hurt
indeed
and
she
would
not
take
another
turn
and
she
accepted
with
great
thanks
a
glass
of
water
which
a
cavalier
who
wore
a
blue
ribbon
and
a
star
rushed
to
fetch
for
her
when
he
had
seen
the
deplorable
accident
she
drank
the
water
smiled
upon
the
bringer
gracefully
and
turning
her
white
shoulder
at
mr
pen
in
the
most
marked
and
haughty
manner
besought
the
gentleman
with
the
star
to
conduct
her
to
her
mamma
and
she
held
out
her
hand
in
order
to
take
his
arm
the
man
with
the
star
trembled
with
delight
at
this
mark
of
her
favour
he
bowed
over
her
hand
pressed
it
to
his
coat
fervidly
and
looked
round
him
with
triumph
it
was
no
other
than
the
happy
mirobolant
whom
blanche
had
selected
as
an
escort
but
the
truth
is
that
the
young
lady
had
never
fairly
looked
in
the
artist
face
since
he
had
been
employed
in
her
mother
family
and
had
no
idea
but
it
was
a
foreign
nobleman
on
whose
arm
she
was
leaning
as
she
went
off
pen
forgot
his
humiliation
in
his
surprise
and
cried
out
by
jove
it
the
cook
the
instant
he
had
uttered
the
words
he
was
sorry
for
having
spoken
them
for
it
was
blanche
who
had
herself
invited
mirobolant
to
escort
her
nor
could
the
artist
do
otherwise
than
comply
with
a
command
blanche
in
her
flutter
did
not
hear
what
arthur
said
but
mirobolant
heard
him
and
cast
a
furious
glance
at
him
over
his
shoulder
which
rather
amused
mr
pen
he
was
in
a
mischievous
and
sulky
humour
wanting
perhaps
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
somebody
but
the
idea
of
having
insulted
a
cook
or
that
such
an
individual
should
have
any
feeling
of
honour
at
all
did
not
much
enter
into
the
mind
of
this
lofty
young
aristocrat
the
apothecary
son
it
had
never
entered
that
poor
artist
head
that
he
as
a
man
was
not
equal
to
any
other
mortal
or
that
there
was
anything
in
his
position
so
degrading
as
to
prevent
him
from
giving
his
arm
to
a
lady
who
asked
for
it
he
had
seen
in
the
fetes
in
his
own
country
fine
ladies
not
certainly
demoiselles
but
the
demoiselle
anglaise
he
knew
was
a
great
deal
more
free
than
the
spinster
in
france
join
in
the
dance
with
blaise
or
pierre
and
he
would
have
taken
blanche
up
to
lady
clavering
and
possibly
have
asked
her
to
dance
too
but
he
heard
pen
exclamation
which
struck
him
as
if
it
had
shot
him
and
cruelly
humiliated
and
angered
him
she
did
not
know
what
caused
him
to
start
and
to
grind
a
gascon
oath
between
his
teeth
but
strong
who
was
acquainted
with
the
poor
fellow
state
of
mind
having
had
the
interesting
information
from
our
friend
madame
fribsby
was
luckily
in
the
way
when
wanted
and
saying
something
rapidly
in
spanish
which
the
other
understood
the
chevalier
begged
miss
amory
to
come
and
take
an
ice
before
she
went
back
to
lady
clavering
upon
which
the
unhappy
mirobolant
relinquished
the
arm
which
he
had
held
for
a
minute
and
with
a
most
profound
and
piteous
bow
fell
back
do
you
know
who
it
is
strong
asked
of
miss
amory
as
he
led
her
away
it
is
the
chef
how
should
i
know
asked
blanche
he
has
a
croix
he
is
very
distingue
he
has
beautiful
the
poor
fellow
is
mad
for
your
beaux
yeux
i
believe
strong
said
he
is
a
very
good
cook
but
he
is
not
quite
right
in
the
what
did
you
say
to
him
in
the
unknown
tongue
asked
miss
blanche
he
is
a
gascon
and
comes
from
the
borders
of
spain
strong
answered
i
told
him
he
would
lose
his
place
if
he
walked
with
poor
monsieur
mirobolant
said
blanche
did
you
see
the
look
he
gave
pendennis
strong
asked
enjoying
the
idea
of
the
mischief
i
think
he
would
like
to
run
little
pen
through
with
one
of
his
he
is
an
odious
conceited
clumsy
creature
that
pen
said
blanche
broadfoot
looked
as
if
he
would
like
to
kill
him
too
so
did
pynsent
strong
said
what
ice
will
you
have
water
ice
or
cream
ice
water
ice
who
is
that
odd
man
staring
at
me
he
is
decore
that
is
my
friend
colonel
altamont
a
very
queer
character
in
the
service
of
the
nawaub
of
lucknow
hallo
what
that
noise
i
be
back
in
an
instant
said
the
chevalier
and
sprang
out
of
the
room
to
the
ballroom
where
a
scuffle
and
a
noise
of
high
voices
was
heard
the
in
which
miss
amory
now
found
herself
was
a
room
set
apart
for
the
purposes
of
supper
which
rincer
the
landlord
had
provided
for
those
who
chose
to
partake
at
the
rate
of
five
shillings
per
head
also
refreshments
of
a
superior
class
were
here
ready
for
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
county
families
who
came
to
the
ball
but
the
commoner
sort
of
persons
were
kept
out
of
the
room
by
a
waiter
who
stood
at
the
portal
and
who
said
that
was
a
select
room
for
lady
clavering
and
lady
rockminster
parties
and
not
to
be
opened
to
the
public
till
which
was
not
to
be
until
past
midnight
pynsent
who
danced
with
his
constituents
daughters
took
them
and
their
mammas
in
for
their
refreshment
there
strong
who
was
manager
and
master
of
the
revels
wherever
he
went
had
of
course
the
entree
and
the
only
person
who
was
now
occupying
the
room
was
the
gentleman
with
the
black
wig
and
the
orders
in
his
button
hole
the
officer
in
the
service
of
his
highness
the
nawaub
of
lucknow
this
gentleman
had
established
himself
very
early
in
the
evening
in
this
apartment
where
saying
he
was
confoundedly
thirsty
he
called
for
a
bottle
of
champagne
at
this
order
the
waiter
instantly
supposed
that
he
had
to
do
with
a
grandee
and
the
colonel
sate
down
and
began
to
eat
his
supper
and
absorb
his
drink
and
enter
affably
into
conversation
with
anybody
who
entered
the
room
sir
francis
clavering
and
wagg
found
him
there
when
they
left
the
ballroom
which
they
did
pretty
early
sir
francis
to
go
and
smoke
a
cigar
and
look
at
the
people
gathered
outside
the
ballroom
on
the
shore
which
he
declared
was
much
better
fun
than
to
remain
within
wagg
to
hang
on
to
a
baronet
arm
as
he
was
always
pleased
to
do
on
the
arm
of
the
greatest
man
in
the
company
colonel
altamont
had
stared
at
these
gentlemen
in
so
odd
a
manner
as
they
passed
through
the
room
that
clavering
made
inquiries
of
the
landlord
who
he
was
and
hinted
a
strong
opinion
that
the
officer
of
the
nawaub
service
was
drunk
pynsent
too
had
had
the
honour
of
a
conversation
with
the
servant
of
the
indian
potentate
it
was
pynsent
cue
to
speak
to
everybody
which
he
did
to
do
him
justice
in
the
most
ungracious
manner
and
he
took
the
gentleman
in
the
black
wig
for
some
constituent
some
merchant
captain
or
other
outlandish
man
of
the
place
pynsent
then
coming
into
the
with
a
lady
the
wife
of
a
constituent
on
his
arm
the
colonel
asked
him
if
he
would
try
a
glass
of
sham
pynsent
took
it
with
great
gravity
bowed
tasted
the
wine
and
pronounced
it
excellent
and
with
the
utmost
politeness
retreated
before
colonel
altamont
this
gravity
and
decorum
routed
and
surprised
the
colonel
more
than
any
other
kind
of
behaviour
probably
would
he
stared
after
pynsent
stupidly
and
pronounced
to
the
landlord
over
the
counter
that
he
was
a
rum
one
rincer
blushed
and
hardly
knew
what
to
say
pynsent
was
a
county
earl
grandson
going
to
set
up
as
a
parliament
man
colonel
altamont
on
the
other
hand
wore
orders
and
diamonds
jingled
sovereigns
constantly
in
his
pocket
and
paid
his
way
like
a
man
so
not
knowing
what
to
say
rincer
said
yes
colonel
yes
did
you
say
tea
cup
a
tea
for
jones
and
so
got
off
that
discussion
regarding
pynsent
qualities
into
which
the
officer
appeared
inclined
to
enter
in
fact
if
the
truth
must
be
told
altamont
having
remained
at
the
buffet
almost
all
night
and
employed
himself
very
actively
whilst
there
had
considerably
flushed
his
brain
by
drinking
and
he
was
still
going
on
drinking
when
strong
and
miss
amory
entered
the
room
when
the
chevalier
ran
out
of
the
apartment
attracted
by
the
noise
in
the
the
colonel
rose
from
his
chair
with
his
little
red
eyes
glowing
like
coals
and
with
rather
an
unsteady
gait
advanced
towards
blanche
who
was
sipping
her
ice
she
was
absorbed
in
absorbing
it
for
it
was
very
fresh
and
good
or
she
was
not
curious
to
know
what
was
going
on
in
the
adjoining
room
although
the
waiters
were
who
ran
after
chevalier
strong
so
that
when
she
looked
up
from
her
glass
she
beheld
this
strange
man
staring
at
her
out
of
his
little
red
eyes
who
was
he
it
was
quite
and
so
you
betsy
amory
said
he
after
gazing
at
her
betsy
amory
by
jove
who
who
speaks
to
me
said
betsy
alias
blanche
but
the
noise
in
the
ballroom
is
really
becoming
so
loud
that
we
must
rush
back
thither
and
see
what
is
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
chapter
xxviii
which
is
both
quarrelsome
and
sentimental
civil
war
was
raging
high
words
passing
people
pushing
and
squeezing
together
in
an
unseemly
manner
round
a
window
in
the
corner
of
the
ballroom
close
by
the
door
through
which
the
chevalier
strong
shouldered
his
way
through
the
opened
window
the
crowd
in
the
street
below
was
sending
up
sarcastic
remarks
such
as
pitch
into
him
where
the
police
and
the
like
and
a
ring
of
individuals
amongst
whom
madame
fribsby
was
conspicuous
was
gathered
round
monsieur
alcide
mirobolant
on
the
one
side
whilst
several
gentlemen
and
ladies
surrounded
our
friend
arthur
pendennis
on
the
other
strong
penetrated
into
this
assembly
elbowing
by
madame
fribsby
who
was
charmed
at
the
chevalier
appearance
and
cried
save
him
save
him
in
frantic
and
pathetic
accents
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
it
appeared
was
the
angry
little
chef
of
sir
francis
clavering
culinary
establishment
shortly
after
strong
had
quitted
the
room
and
whilst
mr
pen
greatly
irate
at
his
downfall
in
the
waltz
which
had
made
him
look
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
the
nation
and
by
miss
amory
behaviour
to
him
which
had
still
further
insulted
his
dignity
was
endeavouring
to
get
some
coolness
of
body
and
temper
by
looking
out
of
window
towards
the
sea
which
was
sparkling
in
the
distance
and
murmuring
in
a
wonderful
calm
whilst
he
was
really
trying
to
compose
himself
and
owning
to
himself
perhaps
that
he
had
acted
in
a
very
absurd
and
peevish
manner
during
the
night
he
felt
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
on
looking
round
beheld
to
his
utter
surprise
and
horror
that
the
hand
in
question
belonged
to
monsieur
mirobolant
whose
eyes
were
glaring
out
of
his
pale
face
and
ringlets
at
mr
pen
to
be
tapped
on
the
shoulder
by
a
french
cook
was
a
piece
of
familiarity
which
made
the
blood
of
the
pendennises
to
boil
up
in
the
veins
of
their
descendant
and
he
was
astounded
almost
more
than
enraged
at
such
an
indignity
you
speak
french
mirobolant
said
in
his
own
language
to
pen
what
is
that
to
you
pray
said
pen
in
english
at
any
rate
you
understand
it
continued
the
other
with
a
bow
yes
sir
said
pen
with
a
stamp
of
his
foot
i
understand
it
pretty
vous
me
comprendrez
alors
monsieur
pendennis
replied
the
other
rolling
out
his
r
with
gascon
force
quand
je
vous
dis
que
vous
etes
un
lache
monsieur
pendennis
un
lache
what
said
pen
starting
round
on
him
you
understand
the
meaning
of
the
word
and
its
consequences
among
men
of
honour
the
artist
said
putting
his
hand
on
his
hip
and
staring
at
pen
the
consequences
are
that
i
will
fling
you
out
of
window
you
impudent
scoundrel
bawled
out
mr
pen
and
darting
upon
the
frenchman
he
would
very
likely
have
put
his
threat
into
execution
for
the
window
was
at
hand
and
the
artist
by
no
means
a
match
for
the
young
gentleman
had
not
captain
broadfoot
and
another
heavy
officer
flung
themselves
between
the
combatants
had
not
the
ladies
begun
to
scream
had
not
the
fiddles
stopped
had
not
the
crowd
of
people
come
running
in
that
direction
had
not
laura
with
a
face
of
great
alarm
looked
over
their
heads
and
asked
for
heaven
sake
what
was
wrong
had
not
the
opportune
strong
made
his
appearance
from
the
and
found
alcides
grinding
his
teeth
and
jabbering
oaths
in
his
galleon
french
and
pen
looking
uncommonly
wicked
although
trying
to
appear
as
calm
as
possible
when
the
ladies
and
the
crowd
came
up
what
has
happened
strong
asked
of
the
chef
in
spanish
i
am
chevalier
de
juillet
said
the
other
slapping
his
breast
and
he
has
insulted
what
has
he
said
to
you
asked
strong
il
appele
cuisinier
hissed
out
the
little
frenchman
strong
could
hardly
help
laughing
come
away
with
me
poor
chevalier
he
said
we
must
not
quarrel
before
ladies
come
away
i
will
carry
your
message
to
mr
the
poor
fellow
is
not
right
in
his
head
he
whispered
to
one
or
two
people
about
him
and
others
and
anxious
laura
face
visible
amongst
these
gathered
round
pen
and
asked
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
pen
did
not
know
the
man
was
going
to
give
his
arm
to
a
young
lady
on
which
i
said
that
he
was
a
cook
and
the
man
called
me
a
coward
and
challenged
me
to
fight
i
own
i
was
so
surprised
and
indignant
that
if
you
gentlemen
had
not
stopped
me
i
should
have
thrown
him
out
of
window
pen
said
d
him
serve
him
right
too
the
impudent
foreign
scoundrel
the
gentlemen
said
i
i
very
sorry
if
i
hurt
his
feelings
though
pen
added
and
laura
was
glad
to
hear
him
say
that
although
some
of
the
young
bucks
said
no
hang
the
fellow
hang
those
impudent
foreigners
little
thrashing
would
do
them
you
will
go
and
shake
hands
with
him
before
you
go
to
sleep
wo
you
pen
said
laura
coming
up
to
him
foreigners
may
be
more
susceptible
than
we
are
and
have
different
manners
if
you
hurt
a
poor
feelings
i
am
sure
you
would
be
the
first
to
ask
his
pardon
you
dear
pen
she
looked
all
forgiveness
and
gentleness
like
an
angel
as
she
spoke
and
pen
took
both
her
hands
and
looked
into
her
kind
face
and
said
indeed
he
would
how
fond
that
girl
is
of
me
he
thought
as
she
stood
gazing
at
him
shall
i
speak
to
her
now
no
not
now
i
must
have
this
absurd
business
with
the
frenchman
laura
asked
would
he
stop
and
dance
with
her
she
was
as
anxious
to
keep
him
in
the
room
as
he
to
quit
it
wo
you
stop
and
waltz
with
me
pen
i
not
afraid
to
waltz
with
this
was
an
affectionate
but
an
unlucky
speech
pen
saw
himself
prostrate
on
the
ground
having
tumbled
over
miss
roundle
and
the
dragoon
and
flung
blanche
up
against
the
wall
saw
himself
on
the
ground
and
all
the
people
laughing
at
him
laura
and
pynsent
amongst
them
i
shall
never
dance
again
he
replied
with
a
dark
and
determined
face
never
i
surprised
you
should
ask
is
it
because
you
ca
get
blanche
for
a
partner
asked
laura
with
a
wicked
unlucky
captiousness
because
i
do
wish
to
make
a
fool
of
myself
for
other
people
to
laugh
at
me
pen
answered
for
you
to
laugh
at
me
laura
i
saw
you
and
pynsent
by
jove
no
man
shall
laugh
at
pen
pen
do
be
so
wicked
cried
out
the
poor
girl
hurt
at
the
morbid
perverseness
and
savage
vanity
of
pen
he
was
glaring
round
in
the
direction
of
pynsent
as
if
he
would
have
liked
to
engage
that
gentleman
as
he
had
done
the
cook
who
thinks
the
worse
of
you
for
stumbling
in
a
waltz
if
laura
does
we
do
why
are
you
so
sensitive
and
ready
to
think
evil
here
again
by
ill
luck
pynsent
came
up
to
laura
and
said
i
have
it
in
command
from
lady
rockminster
to
ask
whether
i
may
take
you
in
to
supper
i
i
was
going
in
with
my
cousin
laura
said
o
pray
no
said
pen
you
are
in
such
good
hands
that
i
ca
do
better
than
leave
you
and
i
going
pendennis
pynsent
said
drily
to
which
speech
which
in
fact
meant
go
to
the
deuce
for
an
insolent
jealous
impertinent
jackanapes
whose
ears
i
should
like
to
box
pendennis
did
not
vouchsafe
any
reply
except
a
bow
and
in
spite
of
imploring
looks
he
left
the
room
how
beautifully
calm
and
bright
the
night
outside
is
said
pynsent
and
what
a
murmur
the
sea
is
making
it
would
be
pleasanter
to
be
walking
on
the
beach
than
in
this
hot
very
said
laura
what
a
strange
congregation
of
people
continued
pynsent
i
have
had
to
go
up
and
perform
the
agreeable
to
most
of
them
the
daughters
the
apothecary
wife
i
scarcely
know
whom
there
was
a
man
in
the
who
insisted
upon
treating
me
to
champagne
a
man
extraordinarily
dressed
and
seeming
half
tipsy
as
a
public
man
one
is
bound
to
conciliate
all
these
people
but
it
is
a
hard
task
especially
when
one
would
so
very
much
like
to
be
elsewhere
and
he
blushed
rather
as
he
spoke
i
beg
your
pardon
said
laura
i
i
was
not
listening
indeed
i
was
frightened
about
that
quarrel
between
my
cousin
and
that
that
french
your
cousin
has
been
rather
unlucky
pynsent
said
there
are
three
or
four
persons
whom
he
has
not
succeeded
in
pleasing
captain
broadwood
what
is
his
name
the
officer
and
the
young
lady
in
red
with
whom
he
danced
and
miss
blanche
and
the
poor
chef
and
i
do
think
he
seemed
to
be
particularly
pleased
with
did
he
leave
me
in
charge
to
you
laura
said
looking
up
into
pynsent
face
and
dropping
her
eyes
instantly
like
a
guilty
little
coquette
indeed
i
can
forgive
him
a
good
deal
for
that
pynsent
eagerly
cried
out
and
she
took
his
arm
and
he
led
off
his
little
prize
in
the
direction
of
the
she
had
no
great
desire
for
that
repast
though
it
was
served
in
rincer
style
as
the
county
paper
said
giving
an
account
of
the
entertainment
afterwards
indeed
she
was
very
distraite
and
exceedingly
pained
and
unhappy
about
pen
captious
and
quarrelsome
jealous
and
selfish
fickle
and
violent
and
unjust
when
his
anger
led
him
astray
how
could
her
mother
as
indeed
helen
had
by
a
thousand
words
and
hints
ask
her
to
give
her
heart
to
such
a
man
and
suppose
she
were
to
do
so
would
it
make
him
happy
but
she
got
some
relief
at
length
when
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
a
long
it
had
seemed
to
her
a
waiter
brought
her
a
little
note
in
pencil
from
pen
who
said
i
met
cooky
below
ready
to
fight
me
and
i
asked
his
pardon
i
glad
i
did
it
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
but
will
keep
what
i
had
to
say
till
you
come
home
god
bless
you
dance
away
all
night
with
pynsent
and
be
very
laura
was
very
thankful
for
this
letter
and
to
think
that
there
was
goodness
and
forgiveness
still
in
her
mother
boy
pen
went
downstairs
his
heart
reproaching
him
for
his
absurd
behaviour
to
laura
whose
gentle
and
imploring
looks
followed
and
rebuked
him
and
he
was
scarcely
out
of
the
ballroom
door
but
he
longed
to
turn
back
and
ask
her
pardon
but
he
remembered
that
he
had
left
her
with
that
confounded
pynsent
he
could
not
apologise
before
him
he
would
compromise
and
forget
his
wrath
and
make
his
peace
with
the
frenchman
the
chevalier
was
pacing
down
below
in
the
hall
of
the
inn
when
pen
descended
from
the
ballroom
and
he
came
up
to
pen
with
all
sorts
of
fun
and
mischief
lighting
up
his
jolly
face
i
have
got
him
in
the
he
said
with
a
brace
of
pistols
and
a
candle
or
would
you
like
swords
on
the
beach
mirobolant
is
a
dead
hand
with
the
foils
and
killed
four
with
his
own
point
in
the
barricades
of
confound
it
said
pen
in
a
fury
i
ca
fight
a
cook
he
is
a
chevalier
of
july
replied
the
other
they
present
arms
to
him
in
his
own
and
do
you
ask
me
captain
strong
to
go
out
with
a
servant
pen
asked
fiercely
i
call
a
policeman
him
but
but
you
invite
me
to
hair
triggers
cried
strong
with
a
laugh
thank
you
for
nothing
i
was
but
joking
i
came
to
settle
quarrels
not
to
fight
them
i
have
been
soothing
down
mirobolant
i
have
told
him
that
you
did
not
apply
the
word
to
him
in
an
offensive
sense
that
it
was
contrary
to
all
the
customs
of
the
country
that
a
hired
officer
of
a
household
as
i
called
it
should
give
his
arm
to
the
daughter
of
the
and
then
he
told
pen
the
grand
secret
which
he
had
had
from
madame
fribsby
of
the
violent
passion
under
which
the
poor
artist
was
labouring
when
arthur
heard
this
tale
he
broke
out
into
a
hearty
laugh
in
which
strong
joined
and
his
rage
against
the
poor
cook
vanished
at
once
he
had
been
absurdly
jealous
himself
all
the
evening
and
had
longed
for
a
pretext
to
insult
pynsent
he
remembered
how
jealous
he
had
been
of
oaks
in
his
first
affair
he
was
ready
to
pardon
anything
to
a
man
under
a
passion
like
that
and
he
went
into
the
where
mirobolant
was
waiting
with
an
outstretched
hand
and
made
him
a
speech
in
french
in
which
he
declared
that
he
was
sincerement
fache
use
une
expression
qui
avoit
pu
blesser
monsieur
mirobolant
et
donnoit
sa
parole
comme
un
gentilhomme
ne
jamais
jamais
intende
said
pen
who
made
a
shot
at
a
french
word
for
intended
and
was
secretly
much
pleased
with
his
own
fluency
and
correctness
in
speaking
that
language
bravo
bravo
cried
strong
as
much
amused
with
pen
speech
as
pleased
by
his
kind
manner
and
the
chevalier
mirobolant
of
course
withdraws
and
sincerely
regrets
the
expression
of
which
he
made
use
monsieur
pendennis
has
disproved
my
words
himself
said
alcide
with
great
politeness
he
has
shown
that
he
is
a
galant
and
so
they
shook
hands
and
parted
arthur
in
the
first
place
despatching
his
note
to
laura
before
he
and
strong
committed
themselves
to
the
butcher
boy
as
they
drove
along
strong
complimented
pen
upon
his
behaviour
as
well
as
upon
his
skill
in
french
you
a
good
fellow
pendennis
and
you
speak
french
like
chateaubriand
by
i
been
accustomed
to
it
from
my
youth
upwards
said
pen
and
strong
had
the
grace
not
to
laugh
for
five
minutes
when
he
exploded
into
fits
of
hilarity
which
pendennis
has
never
perhaps
understood
up
to
this
day
it
was
daybreak
when
they
got
to
the
brawl
where
they
separated
by
that
time
the
ball
at
baymouth
was
over
too
madame
fribsby
and
mirobolant
were
on
their
way
home
in
the
clavering
fly
laura
was
in
bed
with
an
easy
heart
and
asleep
at
lady
rockminster
and
the
claverings
at
rest
at
the
inn
at
baymouth
where
they
had
quarters
for
the
night
a
short
time
after
the
disturbance
between
pen
and
the
chef
blanche
had
come
out
of
the
looking
as
pale
as
a
she
told
her
maid
having
no
other
confidante
at
hand
that
she
had
met
with
the
most
romantic
adventure
the
most
singular
man
one
who
had
known
the
author
of
her
being
her
persecuted
her
unhappy
her
heroic
her
murdered
father
and
she
began
a
sonnet
to
his
manes
before
she
went
to
sleep
so
pen
returned
to
fairoaks
in
company
with
his
friend
the
chevalier
without
having
uttered
a
word
of
the
message
which
he
had
been
so
anxious
to
deliver
to
laura
at
baymouth
he
could
wait
however
until
her
return
home
which
was
to
take
place
on
the
succeeding
day
he
was
not
seriously
jealous
of
the
progress
made
by
pynsent
in
her
favour
and
he
felt
pretty
certain
that
in
this
as
in
any
other
family
arrangement
he
had
but
to
ask
and
have
and
laura
like
his
mother
could
refuse
him
nothing
when
helen
anxious
looks
inquired
of
him
what
had
happened
at
baymouth
and
whether
her
darling
project
was
fulfilled
pen
in
a
gay
tone
told
of
the
calamity
which
had
befallen
laughingly
said
that
no
man
could
think
about
declarations
under
such
a
mishap
and
made
light
of
the
matter
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
for
sentiment
dear
mother
when
laura
comes
back
he
said
and
he
looked
in
the
glass
with
a
killing
air
and
his
mother
put
his
hair
off
his
forehead
and
kissed
him
and
of
course
thought
for
her
part
that
no
woman
could
resist
him
and
was
exceedingly
happy
that
day
when
he
was
not
with
her
mr
pen
occupied
himself
in
packing
books
and
portmanteaus
burning
and
arranging
papers
cleaning
his
gun
and
putting
it
into
its
case
in
fact
in
making
dispositions
for
departure
for
though
he
was
ready
to
marry
this
gentleman
was
eager
to
go
to
london
too
rightly
considering
that
at
it
was
quite
time
for
him
to
begin
upon
the
serious
business
of
life
and
to
set
about
making
a
fortune
as
quickly
as
possible
the
means
to
this
end
he
had
already
shaped
out
for
himself
i
shall
take
chambers
he
said
and
enter
myself
at
an
inn
of
court
with
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
i
shall
be
able
to
carry
through
the
first
year
very
well
after
that
i
have
little
doubt
my
pen
will
support
me
as
it
is
doing
with
several
oxbridge
men
now
in
town
i
have
a
tragedy
a
comedy
and
a
novel
all
nearly
finished
and
for
which
i
ca
fail
to
get
a
price
and
so
i
shall
be
able
to
live
pretty
well
without
drawing
upon
my
poor
mother
until
i
have
made
my
way
at
the
bar
then
some
day
i
will
come
back
and
make
her
dear
soul
happy
by
marrying
laura
she
is
as
good
and
as
a
girl
as
ever
lived
besides
being
really
very
and
the
engagement
will
serve
to
steady
me
it
ponto
thus
smoking
his
pipe
and
talking
to
his
dog
as
he
sauntered
through
the
gardens
and
orchards
of
the
little
domain
of
fairoaks
this
young
built
castles
in
the
air
for
himself
yes
she
steady
me
wo
she
and
you
miss
me
when
i
gone
wo
you
old
boy
he
asked
of
ponto
who
quivered
his
tail
and
thrust
his
brown
nose
into
his
master
fist
ponto
licked
his
hand
and
shoe
as
they
all
did
in
that
house
and
mr
pen
received
their
homage
as
other
folks
do
the
flattery
which
they
get
laura
came
home
rather
late
in
the
evening
of
the
second
day
and
pynsent
as
ill
luck
would
have
it
drove
her
from
clavering
the
poor
girl
could
not
refuse
his
offer
but
his
appearance
brought
a
dark
cloud
upon
the
brow
of
arthur
pendennis
laura
saw
this
and
was
pained
by
it
the
eager
widow
however
was
aware
of
nothing
and
being
anxious
doubtless
that
the
delicate
question
should
be
asked
at
once
was
for
going
to
bed
very
soon
after
laura
arrival
and
rose
for
that
purpose
to
leave
the
sofa
where
she
now
generally
lay
and
where
laura
would
come
and
sit
and
work
or
read
by
her
but
when
helen
rose
laura
said
with
a
blush
and
rather
an
alarmed
voice
that
she
was
also
very
tired
and
wanted
to
go
to
bed
so
that
the
widow
was
disappointed
in
her
scheme
for
that
night
at
least
and
mr
pen
was
left
another
day
in
suspense
regarding
his
fate
his
dignity
was
offended
at
being
thus
obliged
to
remain
in
the
when
he
wanted
an
audience
such
a
sultan
as
he
could
not
afford
to
be
kept
waiting
however
he
went
to
bed
and
slept
upon
his
disappointment
pretty
comfortably
and
did
not
wake
until
the
early
morning
when
he
looked
up
and
saw
his
mother
standing
in
his
room
dear
pen
rouse
up
said
this
lady
do
not
be
lazy
it
is
the
most
beautiful
morning
in
the
world
i
have
not
been
able
to
sleep
since
daybreak
and
laura
has
been
out
for
an
hour
she
is
in
the
garden
everybody
ought
to
be
in
the
garden
and
out
on
such
a
morning
as
pen
laughed
he
saw
what
thoughts
were
uppermost
in
the
simple
heart
his
laughter
cheered
the
widow
oh
you
profound
dissembler
he
said
kissing
his
mother
oh
you
artful
creature
can
nobody
escape
from
your
wicked
tricks
and
will
you
make
your
only
son
your
victim
helen
too
laughed
she
blushed
she
fluttered
and
was
agitated
she
was
as
happy
as
she
could
be
a
good
tender
matchmaking
woman
the
dearest
project
of
whose
heart
was
about
to
be
accomplished
so
after
exchanging
some
knowing
looks
and
hasty
words
helen
left
arthur
and
this
young
hero
rising
from
his
bed
proceeded
to
decorate
his
beautiful
person
and
shave
his
ambrosial
chin
and
in
half
an
hour
he
issued
out
from
his
apartment
into
the
garden
in
quest
of
laura
his
reflections
as
he
made
his
toilette
were
rather
dismal
i
am
going
to
tie
myself
for
life
he
thought
to
please
my
mother
laura
is
the
best
of
women
and
and
she
has
given
me
her
money
i
wish
to
heaven
i
had
not
received
it
i
wish
i
had
not
this
duty
to
perform
just
yet
but
as
both
the
women
have
set
their
hearts
on
the
match
why
i
suppose
i
must
satisfy
them
and
now
for
it
a
man
may
do
worse
than
make
happy
two
of
the
best
creatures
in
the
so
pen
now
he
was
actually
come
to
the
point
felt
very
grave
and
by
no
means
elated
and
indeed
thought
it
was
a
great
sacrifice
he
was
going
to
perform
it
was
miss
laura
custom
upon
her
garden
excursions
to
wear
a
sort
of
uniform
which
though
homely
was
thought
by
many
people
to
be
not
unbecoming
she
had
a
large
straw
hat
with
a
streamer
of
broad
ribbon
which
was
useless
probably
but
the
hat
sufficiently
protected
the
owner
pretty
face
from
the
sun
over
her
accustomed
gown
she
wore
a
blouse
or
pinafore
which
being
fastened
round
her
little
waist
by
a
smart
belt
looked
extremely
well
and
her
hands
were
guaranteed
from
the
thorns
of
her
favourite
by
a
pair
of
gauntlets
which
gave
this
young
lady
a
military
and
resolute
air
somehow
she
had
the
very
same
smile
with
which
she
had
laughed
at
him
on
the
night
previous
and
the
recollection
of
his
disaster
again
offended
pen
but
laura
though
she
saw
him
coming
down
the
walk
looking
so
gloomy
and
full
of
care
accorded
to
him
a
smile
of
the
most
perfect
and
provoking
and
went
to
meet
him
holding
one
of
the
gauntlets
to
him
so
that
he
might
shake
it
if
he
liked
and
mr
pen
condescended
to
do
so
his
face
however
did
not
lose
its
tragic
expression
in
consequence
of
this
favour
and
he
continued
to
regard
her
with
a
dismal
and
solemn
air
excuse
my
glove
said
laura
with
a
laugh
pressing
pen
hand
kindly
with
it
we
are
not
angry
again
are
we
pen
why
do
you
laugh
at
me
said
pen
you
did
the
other
night
and
made
a
fool
of
me
to
the
people
at
my
dear
arthur
i
meant
you
no
wrong
the
girl
answered
you
and
miss
roundle
looked
so
droll
as
you
as
you
met
with
your
little
accident
that
i
could
not
make
a
tragedy
of
it
dear
pen
it
was
a
serious
fall
and
besides
it
was
miss
roundle
who
was
the
most
confound
miss
roundle
bellowed
out
pen
i
sure
she
looked
so
said
laura
archly
you
were
up
in
an
instant
but
that
poor
lady
sitting
on
the
ground
in
her
red
crape
dress
and
looking
about
her
with
that
piteous
face
can
i
ever
forget
her
and
laura
began
to
make
a
face
in
imitation
of
miss
under
the
disaster
but
she
checked
herself
repentantly
saying
well
we
must
not
laugh
at
her
but
i
am
sure
we
ought
to
laugh
at
you
pen
if
you
were
angry
about
such
a
you
should
not
laugh
at
me
laura
said
pen
with
some
bitterness
not
you
of
all
and
why
not
are
you
such
a
great
man
asked
laura
ah
no
laura
i
such
a
poor
one
pen
answered
have
you
baited
me
enough
already
my
dear
pen
and
how
cried
laura
indeed
indeed
i
did
think
to
vex
you
by
such
a
trifle
i
thought
such
a
clever
man
as
you
could
bear
a
harmless
little
joke
from
his
sister
she
said
holding
her
hand
out
again
dear
arthur
if
i
have
hurt
you
i
beg
your
it
is
your
kindness
that
humiliates
me
more
even
than
your
laughter
laura
pen
said
you
are
always
my
what
superior
to
the
great
arthur
pendennis
how
can
it
be
possible
said
miss
laura
who
may
have
had
a
little
wickedness
as
well
as
a
great
deal
of
kindness
in
her
composition
you
ca
mean
that
any
woman
is
your
equal
those
who
confer
benefits
should
not
sneer
said
pen
i
do
like
my
benefactor
to
laugh
at
me
laura
it
makes
the
obligation
very
hard
to
bear
you
scorn
me
because
i
have
taken
your
money
and
i
am
worthy
to
be
scorned
but
the
blow
is
hard
coming
from
money
obligation
for
shame
pen
this
is
ungenerous
laura
said
flushing
red
may
not
our
mother
claim
everything
that
belongs
to
us
do
i
owe
her
all
my
happiness
in
this
world
arthur
what
matters
about
a
few
paltry
guineas
if
we
can
set
her
tender
heart
at
rest
and
ease
her
mind
regarding
you
i
would
dig
in
the
fields
i
would
go
out
and
be
a
servant
i
would
die
for
her
you
know
i
would
said
miss
laura
kindling
up
and
you
call
this
paltry
money
an
obligation
oh
pen
it
cruel
it
unworthy
of
you
to
take
it
so
if
my
brother
may
not
share
with
me
my
superfluity
who
may
mine
i
tell
you
it
was
not
mine
it
was
all
mamma
to
do
with
as
she
chose
and
so
is
everything
i
have
said
laura
my
life
is
and
the
enthusiastic
girl
looked
towards
the
windows
of
the
widow
room
and
blessed
in
her
heart
the
kind
creature
within
helen
was
looking
unseen
out
of
that
window
towards
which
laura
eyes
and
heart
were
turned
as
she
spoke
and
was
watching
her
two
children
with
the
deepest
interest
and
emotion
longing
and
hoping
that
the
prayer
of
her
life
might
be
fulfilled
and
if
laura
had
spoken
as
helen
hoped
who
knows
what
temptations
arthur
pendennis
might
have
been
spared
or
what
different
trials
he
would
have
had
to
undergo
he
might
have
remained
at
fairoaks
all
his
days
and
died
a
country
gentleman
but
would
he
have
escaped
then
temptation
is
an
obsequious
servant
that
has
no
objection
to
the
country
and
we
know
that
it
takes
up
its
lodging
in
hermitages
as
well
as
in
cities
and
that
in
the
most
remote
and
inaccessible
desert
it
keeps
company
with
the
fugitive
solitary
is
your
life
my
mother
said
pen
beginning
to
tremble
and
speak
in
a
very
agitated
manner
you
know
laura
what
the
great
object
of
hers
is
and
he
took
her
hand
once
more
what
arthur
she
said
dropping
it
and
looking
at
him
at
the
window
again
and
then
dropping
her
eyes
to
the
ground
so
that
they
avoided
pen
gaze
she
too
trembled
for
she
felt
that
the
crisis
for
which
she
had
been
secretly
preparing
was
come
our
mother
has
one
wish
above
all
others
in
the
world
laura
pen
said
and
i
think
you
know
it
i
own
to
you
that
she
has
spoken
to
me
of
it
and
if
you
will
fulfil
it
dear
sister
i
am
ready
i
am
but
very
young
as
yet
but
i
have
had
so
many
pains
and
disappointments
that
i
am
old
and
weary
i
think
i
have
hardly
got
a
heart
to
offer
before
i
have
almost
begun
the
race
in
life
i
am
a
tired
man
my
career
has
been
a
failure
i
have
been
protected
by
those
whom
i
by
right
should
have
protected
i
own
that
your
nobleness
and
generosity
dear
laura
shame
me
whilst
they
render
me
grateful
when
i
heard
from
our
mother
what
you
had
done
for
me
that
it
was
you
who
armed
me
and
bade
me
go
out
for
one
struggle
more
i
longed
to
go
and
throw
myself
at
your
feet
and
say
will
you
come
and
share
the
contest
with
me
your
sympathy
will
cheer
me
while
it
lasts
i
shall
have
one
of
the
tenderest
and
most
generous
creatures
under
heaven
to
aid
and
bear
me
company
will
you
take
me
dear
laura
and
make
our
mother
happy
do
you
think
mamma
would
be
happy
if
you
were
otherwise
arthur
laura
said
in
a
low
sad
voice
and
why
should
i
not
be
asked
pen
eagerly
with
so
dear
a
creature
as
you
by
my
side
i
have
not
my
first
love
to
give
you
i
am
a
broken
man
but
indeed
i
would
love
you
fondly
and
truly
i
have
lost
many
an
illusion
and
ambition
but
i
am
not
without
hope
still
talents
i
know
i
have
wretchedly
as
i
have
misapplied
them
they
may
serve
me
yet
they
would
had
i
a
motive
for
action
let
me
go
away
and
think
that
i
am
pledged
to
return
to
you
let
me
go
and
work
and
hope
that
you
will
share
my
success
if
i
gain
it
you
have
given
me
so
much
laura
dear
will
you
take
from
me
nothing
what
have
you
got
to
give
arthur
laura
said
with
a
grave
sadness
of
tone
which
made
pen
start
and
see
that
his
words
had
committed
him
indeed
his
declaration
had
not
been
such
as
he
would
have
made
it
two
days
earlier
when
full
of
hope
and
gratitude
he
had
run
over
to
laura
his
liberatress
to
thank
her
for
his
recovered
freedom
had
he
been
permitted
to
speak
then
he
had
spoken
and
she
perhaps
had
listened
differently
it
would
have
been
a
grateful
heart
asking
for
hers
not
a
weary
one
offered
to
her
to
take
or
to
leave
laura
was
offended
with
the
terms
in
which
pen
offered
himself
to
her
he
had
in
fact
said
that
he
had
no
love
and
yet
would
take
no
denial
i
give
myself
to
you
to
please
my
mother
he
had
said
take
me
as
she
wishes
that
i
should
make
this
the
girl
spirit
would
brook
a
husband
under
no
such
conditions
she
was
not
minded
to
run
forward
because
pen
chose
to
hold
out
the
handkerchief
and
her
tone
in
reply
to
arthur
showed
her
determination
to
be
independent
no
arthur
she
said
our
marriage
would
not
make
mamma
happy
as
she
fancies
for
it
would
not
content
you
very
long
i
too
have
known
what
her
wishes
were
for
she
is
too
open
to
conceal
anything
she
has
at
heart
and
once
perhaps
i
thought
but
that
is
over
now
that
i
could
have
made
you
that
it
might
have
been
as
she
you
have
seen
somebody
else
said
pen
angry
at
her
tone
and
recalling
the
incidents
of
the
past
days
that
allusion
might
have
been
spared
laura
replied
flinging
up
her
head
a
heart
which
has
worn
out
love
at
as
yours
has
you
say
should
have
survived
jealousy
too
i
do
not
condescend
to
say
whether
i
have
seen
or
encouraged
any
other
person
i
shall
neither
admit
the
charge
nor
deny
it
and
beg
you
also
to
allude
to
it
no
i
ask
your
pardon
laura
if
i
have
offended
you
but
if
i
am
jealous
does
it
not
prove
that
i
have
a
heart
not
for
me
arthur
perhaps
you
think
you
love
me
now
but
it
is
only
for
an
instant
and
because
you
are
foiled
were
there
no
obstacle
you
would
feel
no
ardour
to
overcome
it
no
arthur
you
do
love
me
you
would
weary
of
me
in
three
months
as
as
you
do
of
most
things
and
mamma
seeing
you
tired
of
me
would
be
more
unhappy
than
at
my
refusal
to
be
yours
let
us
be
brother
and
sister
arthur
as
heretofore
but
no
more
you
will
get
over
this
little
i
will
try
said
arthur
in
a
great
indignation
have
you
not
tried
before
laura
said
with
some
anger
for
she
had
been
angry
with
arthur
for
a
very
long
time
and
was
now
determined
i
suppose
to
speak
her
mind
and
the
next
time
arthur
when
you
offer
yourself
to
a
woman
do
not
say
as
you
have
done
to
me
have
no
heart
i
do
not
love
you
but
i
am
ready
to
marry
you
because
my
mother
wishes
for
the
match
we
require
more
than
this
in
return
for
our
love
that
is
i
think
so
i
have
had
no
experience
hitherto
and
have
not
had
the
the
practice
which
you
supposed
me
to
have
when
you
spoke
but
now
of
my
having
seen
somebody
else
did
you
tell
your
first
love
that
you
had
no
heart
arthur
or
your
second
that
you
did
not
love
her
but
that
she
might
have
you
if
she
liked
what
what
do
you
mean
asked
arthur
blushing
and
still
in
great
wrath
i
mean
blanche
amory
arthur
pendennis
laura
said
proudly
it
is
but
two
months
since
you
were
sighing
at
her
feet
making
poems
to
her
placing
them
in
hollow
trees
by
the
i
knew
all
i
watched
you
that
is
she
showed
them
to
me
neither
one
nor
the
other
were
in
earnest
perhaps
but
it
is
too
soon
now
arthur
to
begin
a
new
attachment
go
through
the
time
of
your
your
widowhood
at
least
and
do
not
think
of
marrying
until
you
are
out
of
mourning
here
the
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
she
passed
her
hand
across
them
i
am
angry
and
hurt
and
i
have
no
right
to
be
so
and
i
ask
your
pardon
in
my
turn
now
dear
arthur
you
had
a
right
to
love
blanche
she
was
a
thousand
times
prettier
and
more
accomplished
than
than
any
girl
near
us
here
and
you
not
could
know
that
she
had
no
heart
and
so
you
were
right
to
leave
her
too
i
ought
not
to
rebuke
you
about
blanche
amory
and
because
she
deceived
you
pardon
me
pen
and
she
held
the
kind
hand
out
to
pen
once
more
we
were
both
jealous
said
pen
dear
laura
let
us
both
forgive
and
he
seized
her
hand
and
would
have
drawn
her
towards
him
he
thought
that
she
was
relenting
and
already
assumed
the
airs
of
a
victor
but
she
shrank
back
and
her
tears
passed
away
and
she
fixed
on
him
a
look
so
melancholy
and
severe
that
the
young
man
in
his
turn
shrank
before
it
do
not
mistake
me
arthur
she
said
it
can
not
be
you
do
not
know
what
you
ask
and
do
not
be
too
angry
with
me
for
saying
that
i
think
you
do
not
deserve
it
what
do
you
offer
in
exchange
to
a
woman
for
her
love
honour
and
obedience
if
ever
i
say
these
words
dear
pen
i
hope
to
say
them
in
earnest
and
by
the
blessing
of
god
to
keep
my
vow
but
you
what
tie
binds
you
you
do
not
care
about
many
things
which
we
poor
women
hold
sacred
i
do
not
like
to
think
or
ask
how
far
your
incredulity
leads
you
you
offer
to
marry
to
please
our
mother
and
own
that
you
have
no
heart
to
give
away
oh
arthur
what
is
it
you
offer
me
what
a
rash
compact
would
you
enter
into
so
lightly
a
month
ago
and
you
would
have
given
yourself
to
another
i
pray
you
do
not
trifle
with
your
own
or
others
hearts
so
recklessly
go
and
work
go
and
mend
dear
arthur
for
i
see
your
faults
and
dare
speak
of
them
now
go
and
get
fame
as
you
say
that
you
can
and
i
will
pray
for
my
brother
and
watch
our
dearest
mother
at
is
that
your
final
decision
laura
arthur
cried
yes
said
laura
bowing
her
head
and
once
more
giving
him
her
hand
she
went
away
he
saw
her
pass
under
the
creepers
of
the
little
porch
and
disappear
into
the
house
the
curtains
of
his
mother
window
fell
at
the
same
minute
but
he
did
not
mark
that
or
suspect
that
helen
had
been
witnessing
the
scene
was
he
pleased
or
was
he
angry
at
its
termination
he
had
asked
her
and
a
secret
triumph
filled
his
heart
to
think
that
he
was
still
free
she
had
refused
him
but
did
she
not
love
him
that
avowal
of
jealousy
made
him
still
think
that
her
heart
was
his
own
whatever
her
lips
might
utter
and
now
we
ought
perhaps
to
describe
another
scene
which
took
place
at
fairoaks
between
the
widow
and
laura
when
the
latter
had
to
tell
helen
that
she
had
refused
arthur
pendennis
perhaps
it
was
the
hardest
task
of
all
which
laura
had
to
go
through
in
this
matter
and
the
one
which
gave
her
the
most
pain
but
as
we
do
not
like
to
see
a
good
woman
unjust
we
shall
not
say
a
word
more
of
the
quarrel
which
now
befell
between
helen
and
her
adopted
daughter
or
of
the
bitter
tears
which
the
poor
girl
was
made
to
shed
it
was
the
only
difference
which
she
and
the
widow
had
ever
had
as
yet
and
the
more
cruel
from
this
cause
pen
left
home
whilst
it
was
as
yet
pending
and
helen
who
could
pardon
almost
everything
could
not
pardon
an
act
of
justice
in
laura
chapter

babylon
our
reader
must
now
please
to
quit
the
woods
and
of
the
west
and
the
gossip
of
clavering
and
the
humdrum
life
of
poor
little
fairoaks
and
transport
himself
with
arthur
pendennis
on
the
coach
to
london
whither
he
goes
once
for
all
to
face
the
world
and
to
make
his
fortune
as
the
coach
whirls
through
the
night
away
from
the
friendly
gates
of
home
many
a
plan
does
the
young
man
cast
in
his
mind
of
future
life
and
conduct
prudence
and
peradventure
success
and
fame
he
knows
he
is
a
better
man
than
many
who
have
hitherto
been
ahead
of
him
in
the
race
his
first
failure
has
caused
him
remorse
and
brought
with
it
reflection
it
has
not
taken
away
his
courage
or
let
us
add
his
good
opinion
of
himself
a
hundred
eager
fancies
and
busy
hopes
keep
him
awake
how
much
older
his
mishaps
and
a
year
thought
and
have
made
him
than
when
twelve
months
since
he
passed
on
this
road
on
his
way
to
and
from
oxbridge
his
thoughts
turn
in
the
night
with
inexpressible
fondness
and
tenderness
towards
the
fond
mother
who
blessed
him
when
parting
and
who
in
spite
of
all
his
past
faults
and
follies
trusts
him
and
loves
him
still
blessings
be
on
her
he
prays
as
he
looks
up
to
the
stars
overhead
o
heaven
give
him
strength
to
work
to
endure
to
be
honest
to
avoid
temptation
to
be
worthy
of
the
loving
soul
who
loves
him
so
entirely
very
likely
she
is
awake
too
at
that
moment
and
sending
up
to
the
same
father
purer
prayers
than
his
for
the
welfare
of
her
boy
that
woman
love
is
a
talisman
by
which
he
holds
and
hopes
to
get
his
safety
and
laura
he
would
have
fain
carried
her
affection
with
him
too
but
she
has
denied
it
as
he
is
not
worthy
of
it
he
owns
as
much
with
shame
and
remorse
confesses
how
much
better
and
loftier
her
nature
is
than
his
own
confesses
it
and
yet
is
glad
to
be
free
i
am
not
good
enough
for
such
a
creature
he
owns
to
himself
he
draws
back
before
her
spotless
beauty
and
innocence
as
from
something
that
scares
him
he
feels
he
is
not
fit
for
such
a
mate
as
that
as
many
a
wild
prodigal
who
has
been
pious
and
guiltless
in
early
days
keeps
away
from
a
church
which
he
used
to
frequent
once
shunning
it
but
not
hostile
to
it
only
feeling
that
he
has
no
right
in
that
pure
place
with
these
thoughts
to
occupy
him
pen
did
not
fall
asleep
until
the
nipping
dawn
of
an
october
morning
and
woke
considerably
refreshed
when
the
coach
stopped
at
the
old
breakfasting
place
at
b
where
he
had
had
a
score
of
merry
meals
on
his
way
to
and
from
school
and
college
many
times
since
he
was
a
boy
as
they
left
that
place
the
sun
broke
out
brightly
the
pace
was
rapid
the
horn
blew
the
milestones
flew
by
pen
smoked
and
joked
with
guard
and
and
people
along
the
familiar
road
it
grew
more
busy
and
animated
at
every
instant
the
last
team
of
greys
came
out
at
h
and
the
coach
drove
into
london
what
young
fellow
has
not
felt
a
thrill
as
he
entered
the
vast
place
hundreds
of
other
carriages
crowded
with
their
thousands
of
men
were
hastening
to
the
great
city
here
is
my
place
thought
pen
here
is
my
battle
beginning
in
which
i
must
fight
and
conquer
or
fall
i
have
been
a
boy
and
a
dawdler
as
yet
oh
i
long
i
long
to
show
that
i
can
be
a
and
from
his
place
on
the
the
eager
young
fellow
looked
down
upon
the
city
with
the
sort
of
longing
desire
which
young
soldiers
feel
on
the
eve
of
a
campaign
as
they
came
along
the
road
pen
had
formed
acquaintance
with
a
cheery
in
a
shabby
cloak
who
talked
a
great
deal
about
men
of
letters
with
whom
he
was
very
familiar
and
who
was
in
fact
the
reporter
of
a
london
newspaper
as
whose
representative
he
had
been
to
attend
a
great
in
the
west
this
gentleman
knew
intimately
as
it
appeared
all
the
leading
men
of
letters
of
his
day
and
talked
about
tom
campbell
and
tom
hood
and
sydney
smith
and
this
and
the
other
as
if
he
had
been
their
most
intimate
friend
as
they
passed
by
brompton
this
gentleman
pointed
out
to
pen
hurtle
the
reviewer
walking
with
his
umbrella
pen
craned
over
the
coach
to
have
a
long
look
at
the
great
hurtle
he
was
a
boniface
man
said
pen
and
doolan
of
the
star
newspaper
for
such
was
the
gentleman
name
and
address
upon
the
card
which
he
handed
to
pen
said
faith
he
was
and
he
knew
him
very
pen
thought
it
was
quite
an
honour
to
have
seen
the
great
hurtle
whose
works
he
admired
he
believed
fondly
as
yet
in
authors
reviewers
and
editors
of
newspapers
even
wagg
whose
books
did
not
appear
to
him
to
be
masterpieces
of
human
intellect
he
yet
secretly
revered
as
a
successful
writer
he
mentioned
that
he
had
met
wagg
in
the
country
and
doolan
told
him
how
that
famous
novelist
received
three
hundred
pounds
a
volume
for
every
one
of
his
novels
pen
began
to
calculate
instantly
whether
he
might
not
make
five
thousand
a
year
the
very
first
acquaintance
of
his
own
whom
arthur
met
as
the
coach
pulled
up
at
the
gloster
was
his
old
friend
harry
foker
who
came
prancing
down
arlington
street
behind
an
enormous
he
had
white
kid
gloves
and
white
reins
and
nature
had
by
this
time
decorated
him
with
a
considerable
tuft
on
the
chin
a
very
small
vice
stoopid
retired
swung
on
behind
foker
vehicle
and
in
the
tightest
leather
breeches
foker
looked
at
the
dusty
coach
and
the
smoking
horses
of
the
by
which
he
had
made
journeys
in
former
times
what
foker
cried
out
pendennis
hullo
pen
my
boy
said
the
other
and
he
waved
his
whip
by
way
of
amity
and
salute
to
arthur
who
was
very
glad
to
see
his
queer
friend
kind
old
face
doolan
had
a
great
respect
for
pen
who
had
an
acquaintance
in
such
a
grand
cab
and
pen
was
greatly
excited
and
pleased
to
be
at
liberty
and
in
london
he
asked
doolan
to
come
and
dine
with
him
at
the
covent
garden
where
he
put
up
he
called
a
cab
and
rattled
away
thither
in
the
highest
spirits
he
was
glad
to
see
the
bustling
waiter
and
polite
bowing
landlord
again
and
asked
for
the
landlady
and
missed
the
old
boots
and
would
have
liked
to
shake
hands
with
everybody
he
had
a
hundred
pounds
in
his
pocket
he
dressed
himself
in
his
very
best
dined
in
the
with
a
modest
pint
of
sherry
for
he
was
determined
to
be
very
economical
and
went
to
the
theatre
adjoining
the
lights
and
the
music
the
crowd
and
the
gaiety
charmed
and
exhilarated
pen
as
those
sights
will
do
young
fellows
from
college
and
the
country
to
whom
they
are
tolerably
new
he
laughed
at
the
jokes
he
applauded
the
songs
to
the
delight
of
some
of
the
dreary
old
habitues
of
the
boxes
who
had
ceased
long
ago
to
find
the
least
excitement
in
their
place
of
nightly
resort
and
were
pleased
to
see
any
one
so
fresh
and
so
much
amused
at
the
end
of
the
first
piece
he
went
and
strutted
about
the
lobbies
of
the
theatre
as
if
he
was
in
a
resort
of
the
highest
fashion
what
tired
frequenter
of
the
london
pave
is
there
that
can
not
remember
having
had
similar
early
delusions
and
would
not
call
them
back
again
here
was
young
foker
again
like
an
ardent
votary
of
pleasure
as
he
was
he
was
walking
with
grandy
tiptoff
of
the
household
brigade
lord
tiptoff
brother
and
lord
colchicum
captain
uncle
a
venerable
peer
who
had
been
a
man
of
pleasure
since
the
first
french
revolution
foker
rushed
upon
pen
with
eagerness
and
insisted
that
the
latter
should
come
into
his
private
box
where
a
lady
with
the
longest
ringlets
and
the
fairest
shoulders
was
seated
this
was
miss
blenkinsop
the
eminent
actress
of
high
comedy
and
in
the
back
of
the
box
snoozing
in
a
wig
sate
old
blenkinsop
her
papa
he
was
described
in
the
theatrical
prints
as
the
veteran
blenkinsop
the
useful
blenkinsop
that
old
favourite
of
the
public
blenkinsop
those
parts
in
the
drama
which
are
called
the
heavy
fathers
were
usually
assigned
to
this
veteran
who
indeed
acted
the
heavy
father
in
public
as
in
private
life
at
this
time
it
being
about
eleven
pendennis
was
gone
to
bed
at
fairoaks
and
wondering
whether
her
dearest
arthur
was
at
rest
after
his
journey
at
this
time
laura
too
was
awake
and
at
this
time
yesterday
night
as
the
coach
rolled
over
silent
commons
where
cottage
windows
twinkled
and
by
darkling
woods
under
calm
starlit
skies
pen
was
vowing
to
reform
and
to
resist
temptation
and
his
heart
was
at
home
meanwhile
the
farce
was
going
on
very
successfully
and
leary
in
a
hussar
jacket
and
braided
pantaloons
was
enchanting
the
audience
with
her
archness
her
lovely
figure
and
her
delightful
ballads
pen
being
new
to
the
town
would
have
liked
to
listen
to
leary
but
the
other
people
in
the
box
did
not
care
about
her
song
or
her
pantaloons
and
kept
up
an
incessant
chattering
tiptoff
knew
where
her
maillots
came
from
colchicum
saw
her
when
she
came
out
in
miss
blenkinsop
said
she
sang
out
of
all
tune
to
the
pain
and
astonishment
of
pen
who
thought
that
she
was
as
beautiful
as
an
angel
and
that
she
sang
like
a
nightingale
and
when
hoppus
came
on
as
sir
harcourt
featherby
the
young
man
of
the
piece
the
gentlemen
in
the
box
declared
that
hoppus
was
getting
too
stale
and
tiptoff
was
for
flinging
miss
blenkinsop
bouquet
to
him
not
for
the
world
cried
the
daughter
of
the
veteran
blenkinsop
lord
colchicum
gave
it
to
pen
remembered
that
nobleman
name
and
with
a
bow
and
a
blush
said
he
believed
he
had
to
thank
lord
colchicum
for
having
proposed
him
at
the
megatherium
club
at
the
request
of
his
uncle
major
pendennis
what

said
the
peer
i

to
hear
his
venerable
uncle
called
by
such
a
familiar
name
we
balloted
you
in
last
week
did
we
yes
last
wednesday
night
your
uncle
was
here
was
delightful
news
for
pen
he
professed
himself
very
much
obliged
indeed
to
lord
colchicum
and
made
him
a
handsome
speech
of
thanks
to
which
the
other
listened
with
his
double
up
to
his
eyes
pen
was
full
of
excitement
at
the
idea
of
being
a
member
of
this
polite
club
do
be
always
looking
at
that
box
you
naughty
creature
cried
miss
blenkinsop
she
a
fine
woman
that
mirabel
said
tiptoff
though
mirabel
was
a
d
d
fool
to
marry
a
stupid
old
spooney
said
the
peer
mirabel
cried
out
pendennis
ha

laughed
out
harry
foker
we
heard
of
her
before

pen
it
was
pen
first
love
it
was
miss

the
year
before
she
had
been
led
to
the
altar
by
sir
charles
mirabel
and
formerly
envoy
to
the
court
of
pumpernickel
who
had
taken
so
active
a
part
in
the
negotiations
before
the
congress
of
swammerdam
and
signed
on
behalf
of
the
peace
of

emily

always
as
stupid
as
an
owl
said
miss
blenkinsop
eh

pas
si
bete
the
old
peer
said
oh
for
shame
cried
the
actress
who
did
not
in
the
least
know
what
he
meant
and
pen
looked
out
and
beheld
his
first
love
once
again
and
wondered
how
he
ever
could
have
loved
her
thus
on
the
very
first
night
of
his
arrival
in
london
arthur
pendennis
found
himself
introduced
to
a
club
to
an
actress
of
genteel
comedy
and
a
heavy
father
of
the
stage
and
to
a
dashing
society
of
jovial
blades
old
and
young
for
my
lord
colchicum
though
stricken
in
years
bald
of
head
and
enfeebled
in
person
was
still
indefatigable
in
the
pursuit
of
enjoyment
and
it
was
the
venerable
viscount
boast
that
he
could
drink
as
much
claret
as
the
youngest
member
of
the
society
which
he
frequented
he
lived
with
the
youth
about
town
he
gave
them
countless
dinners
at
richmond
and
greenwich
an
enlightened
patron
of
the
drama
in
all
languages
and
of
the
terpsichorean
art
he
received
dramatic
professors
of
all
nations
at
his
banquets

from
the
covent

and

italians
from
the

from
their
own
pretty
little
theatre
or
the
boards
of
the
opera
where
they
danced
and
at
his
villa
on
the
thames
this
pillar
of
the
state
gave
sumptuous
entertainments
to
scores
of
young
men
of
fashion
who
very
affably
consorted
with
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
greenroom
with
the
former
chiefly
for
viscount
colchicum
preferred
their
society
as
more
polished
and
gay
than
that
of
their
male
brethren
pen
went
the
next
day
and
paid
his
at
the
club
which
operation
carried
off
exactly
of
his
hundred
pounds
and
took
possession
of
the
edifice
and
ate
his
luncheon
there
with
immense
satisfaction
he
plunged
into
an
in
the
library
and
tried
to
read
all
the
magazines
he
wondered
whether
the
members
were
looking
at
him
and
that
they
could
dare
to
keep
on
their
hats
in
such
fine
rooms
he
sate
down
and
wrote
a
letter
to
fairoaks
on
the
club
paper
and
said
what
a
comfort
this
place
would
be
to
him
after
his
day
work
was
over
he
went
over
to
his
uncle
lodgings
in
bury
street
with
some
considerable
tremor
and
in
compliance
with
his
mother
earnest
desire
that
he
should
instantly
call
on
major
pendennis
and
was
not
a
little
relieved
to
find
that
the
major
had
not
yet
returned
to
town
his
apartments
were
blank
brown
hollands
covered
his
and
bills
and
letters
lay
on
the
mantelpiece
grimly
awaiting
the
return
of
their
owner
the
major
was
on
the
continent
the
landlady
of
the
house
said
at
badnbadn
with
the
marcus
of
steyne
pen
left
his
card
upon
the
shelf
with
the
rest
fairoaks

written
on
it
still
when
the
major
returned
to
london
which
he
did
in
time
for
the
fogs
of
november
after
enjoying
which
he
proposed
to
spend
christmas
with
some
friends
in
the
country
he
found
another
card
of
arthur
on
which
lamb
court
temple
was
engraved
and
a
note
from
that
young
gentleman
and
from
his
mother
stating
that
he
was

to

entered
a
member
of
the
upper

that
some
ladies
of
fashion
used
to
talk
of
dining
with
ayliffe
the
barrister
who
was
in
society
and
who
lived
there
in
the
bench
of
which
prison
there
was
probably
a
branch
in
the
temple
and
ayliffe
was
very
likely
an
officer
deuceace
lord
crabs
son
had
also
lived
there
he
recollected
he
despatched
morgan
to
find
out
where
lamb
court
was
and
to
report
upon
the
lodging
selected
by
arthur
that
alert
messenger
had
little
difficulty
in
discovering
mr
abode
discreet
morgan
had
in
his
time
traced
people
far
more
difficult
to
find
than
arthur
what
sort
of
a
place
is
it
morgan
asked
the
major
out
of
the
in
bury
street
the
next
morning
as
the
valet
was
arranging
his
toilette
in
the
deep
yellow
london
fog
i
should
say
rayther
a
shy
place
said
morgan
the
lawyers
lives
there
and
has
their
names
on
the
doors
harthur
lives
three
pair
high
sir
warrington
lives
there
too
suffolk
warringtons
i
should
wonder
a
good
family
thought
the
major
the
cadets
of
many
of
our
good
families
follow
the
robe
as
a
profession
comfortable
rooms
eh
honly
saw
the
outside
of
the
door
sir
with
warrington
name
and
arthur
painted
up
and
a
piece
of
paper
with
at
but
i
could
see
no
servant
economical
at
any
rate
said
the
major
very
sir
three
pair
sir
nasty
black
staircase
as
ever
i
see
wonder
how
a
gentleman
can
live
in
such
a
pray
who
taught
you
where
gentlemen
should
or
should
not
live
morgan
arthur
sir
is
going
to
study
for
the
bar
sir
the
major
said
with
much
dignity
and
closed
the
conversation
and
began
to
array
himself
in
the
yellow
fog
boys
will
be
boys
the
mollified
uncle
thought
to
himself
he
has
written
to
me
a
devilish
good
letter
colchicum
says
he
has
had
him
to
dine
and
thinks
him
a
gentlemanlike
lad
his
mother
is
one
of
the
best
creatures
in
the
world
if
he
has
sown
his
wild
oats
and
will
stick
to
his
business
he
may
do
well
yet
think
of
charley
mirabel
the
old
fool
marrying
that
flame
of
his
that
fotheringay
he
does
like
to
come
here
until
i
give
him
leave
and
puts
it
in
a
very
manly
nice
way
i
was
deuced
angry
with
him
after
his
oxbridge
escapades
and
showed
it
too
when
he
was
here
before
gad
i
go
and
see
him
hang
me
if
i
and
having
ascertained
from
morgan
that
he
could
reach
the
temple
without
much
difficulty
and
that
a
city
omnibus
would
put
him
down
at
the
gate
the
major
one
day
after
breakfast
at
his
club
not
the
polyanthus
whereof
mr
pen
was
just
elected
a
member
but
another
club
for
the
major
was
too
wise
to
have
a
nephew
as
a
constant
inmate
of
any
house
where
he
was
in
the
habit
of
passing
his
time
the
major
one
day
entered
one
of
those
public
vehicles
and
bade
the
conductor
to
put
him
down
at
the
gate
of
the
upper
temple
when
major
pendennis
reached
that
dingy
portal
it
was
about
twelve
in
the
day
and
he
was
directed
by
a
civil
personage
with
a
badge
and
a
white
apron
through
some
dark
alleys
and
under
various
melancholy
archways
into
courts
each
more
dismal
than
the
other
until
finally
he
reached
lamb
court
if
it
was
dark
in
pall
mail
what
was
it
in
lamb
court
candles
were
burning
in
many
of
the
rooms
there
in
the
of
hodgeman
the
special
pleader
where
six
pupils
were
scribbling
declarations
under
the
tallow
in
sir
hokey
walker
room
where
the
clerk
a
person
far
more
gentlemanlike
and
cheerful
in
appearance
than
the
celebrated
counsel
his
master
was
conversing
in
a
patronising
manner
with
the
managing
clerk
of
an
attorney
at
the
door
and
in
curling
the
wigmaker
melancholy
shop
where
from
behind
the
feeble
glimmer
of
a
couple
of
lights
large
serpents
and
judges
wigs
were
looming
drearily
with
the
blank
blocks
looking
at
the
in
the
court
two
little
clerks
were
playing
at
under
that
lamp
a
laundress
in
pattens
passed
in
at
one
door
a
newspaper
boy
issued
from
another
a
porter
whose
white
apron
was
faintly
visible
paced
up
and
down
it
would
be
impossible
to
conceive
a
place
more
dismal
and
the
major
shuddered
to
think
that
any
one
should
select
such
a
residence
good
ged
he
said
the
poor
boy
must
live
on
the
feeble
and
filthy
with
which
the
staircases
of
the
upper
temple
are
lighted
of
nights
were
of
course
not
illuminating
the
stairs
by
day
and
major
pendennis
having
read
with
difficulty
his
name
under
warrington
on
the
wall
of
no
found
still
greater
difficulty
in
climbing
the
abominable
black
stairs
up
the
banisters
of
which
which
contributed
their
damp
exudations
to
his
gloves
he
groped
painfully
until
he
came
to
the
third
story
a
candle
was
in
the
passage
of
one
of
the
two
sets
of
rooms
the
doors
were
open
and
the
names
of
warrington
and
pendennis
were
very
clearly
visible
to
the
major
as
he
went
in
an
irish
charwoman
with
a
pail
and
broom
opened
the
door
for
the
major
is
that
the
beer
cried
out
a
great
voice
give
us
hold
of
the
gentleman
who
was
speaking
was
seated
on
a
table
unshorn
and
smoking
a
short
pipe
in
a
farther
chair
sate
pen
with
a
cigar
and
his
legs
near
the
fire
a
little
boy
who
acted
as
the
clerk
of
these
gentlemen
was
grinning
in
the
major
face
at
the
idea
of
his
being
mistaken
for
beer
here
upon
the
third
floor
the
rooms
were
somewhat
lighter
and
the
major
could
see
place
pen
my
boy
it
i
it
your
uncle
he
said
choking
with
the
smoke
but
as
most
young
men
of
fashion
used
the
weed
he
pardoned
the
practice
easily
enough
warrington
got
up
from
the
table
and
pen
in
a
very
perturbed
manner
from
his
chair
beg
your
pardon
for
mistaking
you
said
warrington
in
a
frank
loud
voice
will
you
take
a
cigar
sir
clear
those
things
off
the
chair
pidgeon
and
pull
it
round
to
the
pen
flung
his
cigar
into
the
grate
and
was
pleased
with
the
cordiality
with
which
his
uncle
shook
him
by
the
hand
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
for
the
stairs
and
the
smoke
the
major
began
to
ask
pen
very
kindly
about
himself
and
about
his
mother
for
blood
is
blood
and
he
was
pleased
once
more
to
see
the
boy
pen
gave
his
news
and
then
introduced
warrington
an
old
boniface
man
whose
chambers
he
shared
the
major
was
quite
satisfied
when
he
heard
that
warrington
was
a
younger
son
of
sir
miles
warrington
of
suffolk
he
had
served
with
an
uncle
of
his
in
india
and
in
new
south
wales
years
ago
took
a
there
sir
made
a
fortune
better
thing
than
law
or
soldiering
warrington
said
think
i
shall
go
there
and
here
the
expected
beer
coming
in
in
a
tankard
with
a
glass
bottom
warrington
with
a
laugh
said
he
supposed
the
major
would
not
have
any
and
took
a
long
deep
draught
himself
after
which
he
wiped
his
wrist
across
his
beard
with
great
satisfaction
the
young
man
was
perfectly
easy
and
unembarrassed
he
was
dressed
in
a
ragged
old
shooting
jacket
and
had
a
bristly
blue
beard
he
was
drinking
beer
like
a
coalheaver
and
yet
you
could
but
perceive
that
he
was
a
gentleman
when
he
had
sate
for
a
minute
or
two
after
his
draught
he
went
out
of
the
room
leaving
it
to
pen
and
his
uncle
that
they
might
talk
over
family
affairs
were
they
so
inclined
rough
and
ready
your
chum
seems
the
major
said
somewhat
different
from
your
dandy
friends
at
times
are
altered
arthur
replied
with
a
blush
warrington
is
only
just
called
and
has
no
business
but
he
knows
law
pretty
well
and
until
i
can
afford
to
read
with
a
pleader
i
use
his
books
and
get
his
is
that
one
of
the
books
the
major
asked
with
a
smile
a
french
novel
was
lying
at
the
foot
of
pen
chair
this
is
not
a
working
day
sir
the
lad
said
we
were
out
very
late
at
a
party
last
night
at
lady
whiston
pen
added
knowing
his
uncle
weakness
everybody
in
town
was
there
except
you
sir
counts
ambassadors
turks
stars
and
garters
i
do
know
who
it
all
in
the
paper
and
my
name
too
said
pen
with
great
glee
i
met
an
old
flame
of
mine
there
sir
he
added
with
a
laugh
you
know
whom
i
mean
sir
lady
mirabel
to
whom
i
was
introduced
over
again
she
shook
hands
and
was
gracious
enough
i
may
thank
you
for
being
out
of
that
scrape
sir
she
presented
me
to
the
husband
too
an
old
beau
in
a
star
and
a
blonde
wig
he
does
not
seem
very
wise
she
has
asked
me
to
call
on
her
sir
and
i
may
go
now
without
any
fear
of
losing
my
what
we
have
had
some
new
loves
have
we
the
major
asked
in
high
some
two
or
three
mr
pen
said
laughing
but
i
do
put
on
my
grand
serieux
any
more
sir
that
goes
off
after
the
first
very
right
my
dear
boy
flames
and
darts
and
passion
and
that
sort
of
thing
do
very
well
for
a
lad
and
you
were
but
a
lad
when
that
affair
with
the
fotheringill
fotheringay
what
her
name
came
off
but
a
man
of
the
world
gives
up
those
follies
you
still
may
do
very
well
you
have
been
bit
but
you
may
recover
you
are
heir
to
a
little
independence
which
everybody
fancies
is
a
doosid
deal
more
you
have
a
good
name
good
wits
good
manners
and
a
good
person
and
begad
i
do
see
why
you
should
marry
a
woman
with
money
get
into
parliament
distinguish
yourself
and
and
in
fact
that
sort
of
thing
remember
it
as
easy
to
marry
a
rich
woman
as
a
poor
woman
and
a
devilish
deal
pleasanter
to
sit
down
to
a
good
dinner
than
to
a
scrag
of
mutton
in
lodgings
make
up
your
mind
to
that
a
woman
with
a
good
jointure
is
a
doosid
deal
easier
a
profession
than
the
law
let
me
tell
you
that
look
out
i
shall
be
on
the
watch
for
you
and
i
shall
die
content
my
boy
if
i
can
see
you
with
a
good
ladylike
wife
and
a
good
carriage
and
a
good
pair
of
horses
living
in
society
and
seeing
your
friends
like
a
gentleman
would
you
like
to
vegetate
like
your
dear
good
mother
at
fairoaks
dammy
sir
life
without
money
and
the
best
society
is
worth
it
was
thus
this
affectionate
uncle
spoke
and
expounded
to
pen
his
simple
philosophy
what
would
my
mother
and
laura
say
to
this
i
wonder
thought
the
lad
indeed
old
pendennis
morals
were
not
their
morals
nor
was
his
wisdom
theirs
this
affecting
conversation
between
uncle
and
nephew
had
scarcely
concluded
when
warrington
came
out
of
his
bedroom
no
longer
in
rags
but
dressed
like
a
gentleman
straight
and
tall
and
perfectly
frank
and
he
did
the
honours
of
his
ragged
with
as
much
ease
as
if
it
had
been
the
finest
apartment
in
london
and
queer
rooms
they
were
in
which
the
major
found
his
nephew
the
carpet
was
full
of
holes
the
table
stained
with
many
circles
of
warrington
previous
there
was
a
small
library
of
books
of
poetry
and
of
mathematics
of
which
he
was
very
fond
he
had
been
one
of
the
hardest
livers
and
hardest
readers
of
his
time
at
oxbridge
where
the
name
of
stunning
warrington
was
yet
famous
for
beating
bargemen
pulling
matches
winning
prizes
and
drinking
a
print
of
the
old
college
hung
up
over
the
mantelpiece
and
some
battered
volumes
of
plato
bearing
its
arms
were
on
the
there
were
two
a
standing
piled
with
bills
a
couple
of
very
meagre
briefs
on
a
indeed
there
was
scarcely
any
article
of
furniture
that
had
not
been
in
the
wars
and
was
not
wounded
look
here
sir
here
is
pen
room
he
is
a
dandy
and
has
got
curtains
to
his
bed
and
wears
shiny
boots
and
a
silver
indeed
pen
room
was
rather
coquettishly
arranged
and
a
couple
of
neat
prints
of
besides
a
drawing
of
fairoaks
hung
on
the
walls
in
warrington
room
there
was
scarcely
any
article
of
furniture
save
a
great
and
a
heap
of
books
by
the
bedside
where
he
lay
upon
straw
like
margery
daw
and
smoked
his
pipe
and
read
half
through
the
night
his
favourite
poetry
or
mathematics
when
he
had
completed
his
simple
toilette
warrington
came
out
of
this
room
and
proceeded
to
the
cupboard
to
search
for
his
breakfast
might
i
offer
you
a
sir
we
cook
ourselves
hot
and
hot
and
i
am
teaching
pen
the
first
principles
of
law
cooking
and
morality
at
the
same
time
he
a
lazy
beggar
sir
and
too
much
of
a
and
so
saying
warrington
wiped
a
gridiron
with
a
piece
of
paper
put
it
on
the
fire
and
on
it
two
and
took
from
the
cupboard
a
couple
of
plates
and
some
knives
and
silver
forks
and
castors
say
but
a
word
major
pendennis
he
said
there
another
chop
in
the
cupboard
or
pidgeon
shall
go
out
and
get
you
anything
you
major
pendennis
sate
in
wonder
and
amusement
but
he
said
he
had
just
breakfasted
and
would
have
any
lunch
so
warrington
cooked
the
chops
and
popped
them
hissing
hot
upon
the
plates
pen
fell
to
at
his
chop
with
a
good
appetite
after
looking
up
at
his
uncle
and
seeing
that
gentleman
was
still
in
you
see
sir
warrington
said
mrs
flanagan
is
here
to
do
and
we
ca
employ
the
boy
for
the
little
beggar
is
all
day
occupied
cleaning
pen
boots
and
now
for
another
swig
at
the
beer
pen
drinks
tea
it
only
fit
for
old
and
so
you
were
at
lady
whiston
last
night
the
major
said
not
in
truth
knowing
what
observation
to
make
to
this
rough
diamond
i
at
lady
whiston
not
such
a
flat
sir
i
do
care
for
female
society
in
fact
it
bores
me
i
spent
my
evening
philosophically
at
the
back
the
back
kitchen
indeed
said
the
major
i
see
you
do
know
what
it
means
warrington
said
ask
pen
he
was
there
after
lady
whiston
tell
major
pendennis
about
the
back
kitchen
pen
do
be
ashamed
of
so
pen
said
it
was
a
little
eccentric
society
of
men
of
letters
and
men
about
town
to
which
he
had
been
presented
and
the
major
began
to
think
that
the
young
fellow
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
the
world
since
his
arrival
in
london
chapter
xxx
the
knights
of
the
temple
colleges
schools
and
inns
of
courts
still
have
some
respect
for
antiquity
and
maintain
a
great
number
of
the
customs
and
institutions
of
our
ancestors
with
which
those
persons
who
do
not
particularly
regard
their
forefathers
or
perhaps
are
not
very
well
acquainted
with
them
have
long
since
done
away
a
workhouse
or
prison
is
much
better
provided
with
the
appliances
of
health
comfort
and
cleanliness
than
a
respectable
foundation
school
a
venerable
college
or
a
learned
inn
in
the
latter
place
of
residence
men
are
contented
to
sleep
in
dingy
closets
and
to
pay
for
the
and
the
cupboard
which
is
their
dormitory
the
price
of
a
good
villa
and
garden
in
the
suburbs
or
of
a
roomy
house
in
the
neglected
squares
of
the
town
the
poorest
mechanic
in
spitalfields
has
a
cistern
and
an
unbounded
suppy
of
water
at
his
command
but
the
gentlemen
of
the
inns
of
court
and
the
gentlemen
of
the
universities
have
their
supply
of
this
cosmetic
fetched
in
jugs
by
laundresses
and
bedmakers
and
live
in
abodes
which
were
erected
long
before
the
custom
of
cleanliness
and
decency
obtained
among
us
there
are
individuals
still
alive
who
sneer
at
the
people
and
speak
of
them
with
epithets
of
scorn
gentlemen
there
can
be
but
little
doubt
that
your
ancestors
were
the
great
unwashed
and
in
the
temple
especially
it
is
pretty
certain
that
only
under
the
greatest
difficulties
and
restrictions
the
virtue
which
has
been
pronounced
to
be
next
to
godliness
could
have
been
practised
at
all
old
grump
of
the
norfolk
circuit
who
had
lived
for
more
than
thirty
years
in
the
chambers
under
those
occupied
by
warrington
and
pendennis
and
who
used
to
be
awakened
by
the
roaring
of
the
which
those
gentlemen
had
erected
in
their
apartments
a
part
of
the
contents
of
which
occasionally
trickled
through
the
roof
into
room
declared
that
the
practice
was
an
absurd
newfangled
dandified
folly
and
daily
cursed
the
laundress
who
slopped
the
staircase
by
which
he
had
to
pass
grump
now
much
more
than
half
a
century
old
had
indeed
never
used
the
luxury
in
question
he
had
done
without
water
very
well
and
so
had
our
fathers
before
him
of
all
those
knights
and
baronets
lords
and
gentlemen
bearing
arms
whose
escutcheons
are
painted
upon
the
walls
of
the
famous
hall
of
the
upper
temple
was
there
no
philanthropist
enough
to
devise
a
set
of
hummums
for
the
benefit
of
the
lawyers
his
fellows
and
successors
the
temple
historian
makes
no
mention
of
such
a
scheme
there
is
pump
court
and
fountain
court
with
their
hydraulic
apparatus
but
one
never
heard
of
a
bencher
disporting
in
the
fountain
and
ca
but
think
how
many
a
counsel
learned
in
the
law
of
old
days
might
have
benefited
by
the
pump
nevertheless
those
venerable
inns
which
have
the
lamb
and
flag
and
the
winged
horse
for
their
ensigns
have
attractions
for
persons
who
inhabit
them
and
a
share
of
rough
comforts
and
freedom
which
men
always
remember
with
pleasure
i
do
know
whether
the
student
of
law
permits
himself
the
refreshment
of
enthusiasm
or
indulges
in
poetical
reminiscences
as
he
passes
by
historical
chambers
and
says
yonder
eldon
lived
upon
this
site
coke
mused
upon
littleton
here
chitty
toiled
here
barnewall
and
alderson
joined
in
their
famous
labours
here
byles
composed
his
great
work
upon
bills
and
smith
compiled
his
immortal
leading
cases
here
gustavus
still
toils
with
solomon
to
aid
him
but
the
man
of
letters
ca
but
love
the
place
which
has
been
inhabited
by
so
many
of
his
brethren
or
peopled
by
their
creations
as
real
to
us
at
this
day
as
the
authors
whose
children
they
were
and
sir
roger
de
coverley
walking
in
the
temple
garden
and
discoursing
with
spectator
about
the
beauties
in
hoops
and
patches
who
are
sauntering
over
the
grass
is
just
as
lively
a
figure
to
me
as
old
samuel
johnson
rolling
through
the
fog
with
the
scotch
gentleman
at
his
heels
on
their
way
to
goldsmith
chambers
in
brick
court
or
harry
fielding
with
inked
ruffles
and
a
wet
towel
round
his
head
dashing
off
articles
at
midnight
for
the
covent
garden
journal
while
the
printer
boy
is
asleep
in
the
passage
if
we
could
but
get
the
history
of
a
single
day
as
it
passed
in
any
one
of
those
houses
in
the
dingy
court
where
our
friends
pen
and
warrington
dwelt
some
temple
asmodeus
might
furnish
us
with
a
queer
volume
there
may
be
a
great
parliamentary
counsel
on
the
ground
floor
who
drives
off
to
belgravia
at
when
his
clerk
too
becomes
a
gentleman
and
goes
away
to
entertain
his
friends
and
to
take
his
pleasure
but
a
short
time
since
he
was
hungry
and
briefless
in
some
garret
of
the
inn
lived
by
stealthy
literature
hoped
and
waited
and
sickened
and
no
clients
came
exhausted
his
own
means
and
his
kindness
had
to
remonstrate
humbly
with
duns
and
to
implore
the
patience
of
poor
creditors
ruin
seemed
to
be
staring
him
in
the
face
when
behold
a
turn
of
the
wheel
of
fortune
and
the
lucky
wretch
in
possession
of
one
of
those
prodigious
prizes
which
are
sometimes
drawn
in
the
great
lottery
of
the
bar
many
a
better
lawyer
than
himself
does
not
make
a
fifth
part
of
the
income
of
his
clerk
who
a
few
months
since
could
scarcely
get
credit
for
blacking
for
his
master
unpaid
boots
on
the
first
floor
perhaps
you
will
have
a
venerable
man
whose
name
is
famous
who
has
lived
for
half
a
century
in
the
inn
whose
brains
are
full
of
books
and
whose
shelves
are
stored
with
classical
and
legal
lore
he
has
lived
alone
all
these
fifty
years
alone
and
for
himself
amassing
learning
and
compiling
a
fortune
he
comes
home
now
at
night
alone
from
the
club
where
he
has
been
dining
freely
to
the
lonely
chambers
where
he
lives
a
godless
old
recluse
when
he
dies
his
inn
will
erect
a
tablet
to
his
honour
and
his
heirs
burn
a
part
of
his
library
would
you
like
to
have
such
a
prospect
for
your
old
age
to
store
up
learning
and
money
and
end
so
but
we
must
not
linger
too
long
by
doomsday
door
worthy
grump
lives
over
him
who
is
also
an
ancient
inhabitant
of
the
inn
and
who
when
doomsday
comes
home
to
read
catullus
is
sitting
down
with
three
steady
seniors
of
his
standing
to
a
steady
rubber
at
whist
after
a
dinner
at
which
they
have
consumed
their
three
steady
bottles
of
port
you
may
see
the
old
boys
asleep
at
the
temple
church
of
a
sunday
attorneys
seldom
trouble
them
and
they
have
small
fortunes
of
their
own
on
the
other
side
of
the
third
landing
where
pen
and
warrington
live
till
long
after
midnight
sits
paley
who
took
the
highest
honours
and
who
is
a
fellow
of
his
college
who
will
sit
and
read
and
note
cases
until
two
in
the
morning
who
will
rise
at
seven
and
be
at
the
pleader
chambers
as
soon
as
they
are
open
where
he
will
work
until
an
hour
before
who
will
come
home
from
hall
and
read
and
note
cases
again
until
dawn
next
day
when
perhaps
arthur
pendennis
and
his
friend
warrington
are
returning
from
some
of
their
wild
expeditions
how
differently
employed
paley
has
been
he
has
not
been
throwing
himself
away
he
has
only
been
bringing
a
great
intellect
laboriously
down
to
the
comprehension
of
a
mean
subject
and
in
his
fierce
grasp
of
that
resolutely
excluding
from
his
mind
all
higher
thoughts
all
better
things
all
the
wisdom
of
philosophers
and
historians
all
the
thoughts
of
poets
all
wit
fancy
reflection
art
love
truth
altogether
so
that
he
may
master
that
enormous
legend
of
the
law
which
he
proposes
to
gain
his
livelihood
by
expounding
warrington
and
paley
had
been
competitors
for
university
honours
in
former
days
and
had
run
each
other
hard
and
everybody
said
now
that
the
former
was
wasting
his
time
and
energies
whilst
all
people
praised
paley
for
his
industry
there
may
be
doubts
however
as
to
which
was
using
his
time
best
the
one
could
afford
time
to
think
and
the
other
never
could
the
one
could
have
sympathies
and
do
kindnesses
and
the
other
must
needs
be
always
selfish
he
could
not
cultivate
a
friendship
or
do
a
charity
or
admire
a
work
of
genius
or
kindle
at
the
sight
of
beauty
or
the
sound
of
a
sweet
song
he
had
no
time
and
no
eyes
for
anything
but
his
all
was
dark
outside
his
love
and
nature
and
art
which
is
the
expression
of
our
praise
and
sense
of
the
beautiful
world
of
god
were
shut
out
from
him
and
as
he
turned
off
his
lonely
lamp
at
night
he
never
thought
but
that
he
had
spent
the
day
profitably
and
went
to
sleep
alike
thankless
and
remorseless
but
he
shuddered
when
he
met
his
old
companion
warrington
on
the
stairs
and
shunned
him
as
one
that
was
doomed
to
perdition
it
may
have
been
the
sight
of
that
cadaverous
ambition
and
meanness
which
showed
itself
in
paley
yellow
face
and
twinkled
in
his
narrow
eyes
or
it
may
have
been
a
natural
appetite
for
pleasure
and
joviality
of
which
it
must
be
confessed
mr
pen
was
exceedingly
fond
which
deterred
that
luckless
youth
from
pursuing
his
designs
upon
the
bench
or
the
woolsack
with
the
ardour
or
rather
steadiness
which
is
requisite
in
gentlemen
who
would
climb
to
those
seats
of
honour
he
enjoyed
the
temple
life
with
a
great
deal
of
relish
his
worthy
relatives
thought
he
was
reading
as
became
a
regular
student
and
his
uncle
wrote
home
congratulatory
letters
to
the
kind
widow
at
fairoaks
announcing
that
the
lad
had
sown
his
wild
oats
and
was
becoming
quite
steady
the
truth
is
that
it
was
a
new
sort
of
excitement
to
pen
the
life
in
which
he
was
now
engaged
and
having
given
up
some
of
the
dandified
pretensions
and
airs
which
he
had
contracted
among
his
aristocratic
college
acquaintances
of
whom
he
now
saw
but
little
the
rough
pleasures
and
amusements
of
a
london
bachelor
were
very
novel
and
agreeable
to
him
and
he
enjoyed
them
all
time
was
he
would
have
envied
the
dandies
their
fine
horses
in
rotten
row
but
he
was
contented
now
to
walk
in
the
park
and
look
at
them
he
was
too
young
to
succeed
in
london
society
without
a
better
name
and
a
larger
fortune
than
he
had
and
too
lazy
to
get
on
without
these
adjuncts
old
pendennis
fondly
thought
he
was
busied
with
law
because
he
neglected
the
social
advantages
presented
to
him
and
having
been
at
half
a
dozen
balls
and
evening
parties
retreated
before
their
dulness
and
sameness
and
whenever
anybody
made
inquiries
of
the
worthy
major
about
his
nephew
the
old
gentleman
said
the
young
rascal
was
reformed
and
could
not
be
got
away
from
his
books
but
the
major
would
have
been
almost
as
much
horrified
as
paley
was
had
he
known
what
was
mr
pen
real
course
of
life
and
how
much
pleasure
entered
into
his
law
studies
a
long
morning
reading
a
walk
in
the
park
a
pull
on
the
river
a
stretch
up
the
hill
to
hampstead
and
a
modest
tavern
dinner
a
bachelor
night
passed
here
or
there
in
joviality
not
vice
for
arthur
pendennis
admired
women
so
heartily
that
he
never
could
bear
the
society
of
any
of
them
that
were
not
in
his
fancy
at
least
good
and
pure
a
quiet
evening
at
home
alone
with
a
friend
and
a
pipe
or
two
and
a
humble
potation
of
british
spirits
whereof
flanagan
the
laundress
invariably
tested
the
quality
these
were
our
young
pursuits
and
it
must
be
owned
that
his
life
was
not
unpleasant
in
mr
pen
showed
a
most
praiseworthy
regularity
in
performing
one
part
of
the
course
of
duty
and
eating
his
dinners
in
hall
indeed
that
hall
of
the
upper
temple
is
a
sight
not
uninteresting
and
with
the
exception
of
some
trifling
improvements
and
anachronisms
which
have
been
introduced
into
the
practice
there
a
man
may
sit
down
and
fancy
that
he
joins
in
a
meal
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
bar

their
messes
the
students
their
tables
apart
the

at
the
high
table
on
the
raised
platform
surrounded
by

of

of
the
law
and
portraits
of
royal
personages
who
have
honoured
its
festivities
with
their
presence
and
patronage
pen
looked
about
on
his
first
introduction
not
a
little
amused
with
the
scene
which
he
witnessed
among
his
comrades
of
the
student
class
there
were
gentlemen
of
all
ages
from
sixty
to
seventeen
stout
attorneys
who
were
proceeding
to
take
the
superior
dignity
dandies
and
men
about
town
who
wished
for
some
reason
to
be
barristers
of
seven
years
standing
swarthy
natives
of
the
colonies
who
came
to
be
called
here
before
they
practised
in
their
own
islands
and
many
gentlemen
of
the
irish
nation
who
make
a
sojourn
in
middle
temple
lane
before
they
return
to
the
green
country
of
their
birth
there
were
little
squads
of
reading
students
who
talked
law
all
there
were
rowing
men
whose
discourse
was
of
sculling
matches
the
red
house
vauxhall
and
the
opera
there
were
others
great
in
politics
and
orators
of
the
students
debating
clubs
with
all
of
which
sets
except
the
first
whose
talk
was
an
almost
unknown
and
a
quite
uninteresting
language
to
him
mr
pen
made
a
gradual
acquaintance
and
had
many
points
of
sympathy
the
ancient
and
liberal
inn
of
the
upper
temple
provides
in
its
hall
and
for
a
most
moderate
price
an
excellent
wholesome
dinner
of
soup
meat
tarts
and
port
wine
or
sherry
for
the
barristers
and
students
who
attend
that
place
of
refection
the
parties
are
arranged
in
messes
of
four
each
of
which
quartets
has
its
piece
of
beef
or
leg
of
mutton
its
sufficient
and
its
bottle
of
wine
but
the
honest
habitues
of
the
hall
amongst
the
lower
rank
of
students
who
have
a
taste
for
good
living
have
many
harmless
arts
by
which
they
improve
their
banquet
and
innocent
if
we
may
be
permitted
to
use
an
excellent
phrase
that
has
become
vernacular
since
the
appearance
of
the
last
dictionaries
by
which
they
strive
to
attain
for
themselves
more
delicate
food
than
the
common
roast
meat
of
the
tables

one
of
these

gourmands

tugging
at

the
are
very
full
and
there
only
three
benchers
to
eat
ten
dishes
if
we
wait
perhaps
we
shall
get
something
from
their
and
pen
looked
with
some
amusement
as
did
lowton
with
eyes
of
fond
desire
towards
the
benchers
high
table
where
three
old
gentlemen
were
standing
up
before
a
dozen
silver
while
the
clerk
was
quavering
out
a
grace
lowton
was
great
in
the
conduct
of
the
dinner
his
aim
was
to
manage
so
as
to
be
the
first
a
captain
of
the
mess
and
to
secure
for
himself
the
thirteenth
glass
of
the
bottle
of
port
wine
thus
he
would
have
the
command
of
the
joint
on
which
he
operated
his
favourite
cuts
and
made
rapid
dexterous
appropriations
of
gravy
which
amused
pen
infinitely
poor
jack
lowton
thy
pleasures
in
life
were
very
harmless
an
eager
epicure
thy
desires
did
not
go
beyond
eighteen
pence
pen
was
somewhat
older
than
many
of
his
and
there
was
that
about
his
style
and
appearance
which
as
we
have
said
was
rather
haughty
and
impertinent
that
stamped
him
as
a
man
of
ton
very
unlike
those
pale
students
who
were
talking
law
to
one
another
and
those
ferocious
dandies
in
rowing
shirts
and
astonishing
pins
and
waistcoats
who
represented
the
idle
part
of
the
little
community
the
humble
and
lowton
had
felt
attracted
by
pen
superior
looks
and
presence
and
had
made
acquaintance
with
him
at
the
mess
by
opening
the
conversation
this
is
day
i
believe
sir
said
lowton
to
pen
upon
my
word
sir
i
not
aware
said
pen
hardly
able
to
contain
his
laughter
but
added
i
a
stranger
this
is
my
first
term
on
which
lowton
began
to
point
out
to
him
the
notabilities
in
the
hall
that
boosey
the
bencher
the
bald
one
sitting
under
the
picture
and

i
wonder
whether

often
ave

you
know

the
senior
of

they
say
he
dined
here
forty
years
they
often
send
down
their
fish
from
the
benchers
to
the
senior

do
you
see
those

three
chaps

a
sly
fellow
pen
said
delighted
with
his
acquaintance
on
which
the
other
modestly
replied
that
he
had
lived
in
london
the
better
part
of
his
life
and
of
course
had
his
eyes
about
him
and
went
on
with
his
catalogue
to
pen
there
a
lot
of
irish
here
he
said
that
corkoran
one
and
i
ca
say

that
handsome
chap
with

blue

lowton
said
trying
to
imitate
the
hibernian
accent
he
always
bragging
about
his
uncle
and
came
into
hall
in
trousers
the
day
he
had
been
presented
that
other
near
him
with
the
long
black
hair
is
a
tremendous
rebel
by
jove
sir
to
hear
him
at
the
forum
it
makes
your
blood
freeze
and
the
next
is
an
irishman
too
jack
finucane
reporter
of
a
newspaper
they
all
stick
together
those
irish
it
your
turn
to
fill
your
glass
what
you
wo
have
any
port
do
like
port
with
your
dinner
here
your
and
this
worthy
man
found
himself
not
the
less
attached
to
pendennis
because
the
latter
disliked
port
wine
at
dinner
it
was
while
pen
was
taking
his
share
of
one
of
these
dinners
with
his
acquaintance
lowton
as
the
captain
of
his
mess
that
there
came
to
join
them
a
gentleman
in
a
barrister
gown
who
could
not
find
a
seat
as
it
appeared
amongst
the
persons
of
his
own
degree
and
who
strode
over
the
table
and
took
his
place
on
the
bench
where
pen
sate
he
was
dressed
in
old
clothes
and
a
faded
gown
which
hung
behind
him
and
he
wore
a
shirt
which
though
clean
was
extremely
ragged
and
very
different
to
the
magnificent
pink
raiment
of
molloy
maloney
who
occupied
a
commanding
position
in
the
next
mess
in
order
to
notify
their
appearance
at
dinner
it
is
the
custom
of
the
gentlemen
who
eat
in
the
upper
temple
hall
to
write
down
their
names
upon
slips
of
paper
which
are
provided
for
that
purpose
with
a
pencil
for
each
mess
lowton
wrote
his
name
first
then
came
arthur
pendennis
and
the
next
was
that
of
the
gentleman
in
the
old
clothes
he
smiled
when
he
saw
pen
name
and
looked
at
him
we
ought
to
know
each
other
he
said
we
both
boniface
men
my
name
are
you
st
warrington
pen
said
delighted
to
see
this
hero
warrington
laughed
stunning
warrington
yes
he
said
i
recollect
you
in
your
freshman
term
but
you
appear
to
have
quite
cut
me
the
college
talks
about
you
still
said
pen
who
had
a
generous
admiration
for
talent
and
pluck
the
bargeman
you
thrashed
bill
simes
do
you
remember
wants
you
up
again
at
oxbridge
the
miss
notleys
the
haberdashers
hush
said
warrington
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
pendennis
heard
a
good
deal
about
the
young
men
were
friends
immediately
and
at
once
deep
in
and
pen
who
had
been
acting
rather
the
fine
gentleman
on
a
previous
day
when
he
pretended
to
lowton
that
he
could
not
drink
port
wine
at
dinner
seeing
warrington
take
his
share
with
a
great
deal
of
gusto
did
not
scruple
about
helping
himself
any
more
rather
to
the
disappointment
of
honest
lowton
when
the
dinner
was
over
warrington
asked
arthur
where
he
was
going
i
thought
of
going
home
to
dress
and
hear
grisi
in
norma
pen
said
are
you
going
to
meet
anybody
there
he
asked
pen
said
no
only
to
hear
the
music
of
which
he
was
fond
you
had
much
better
come
home
and
smoke
a
pipe
with
me
said
warrington
a
very
short
one
come
i
live
close
by
in
lamb
court
and
we
talk
over
boniface
and
old
they
went
away
lowton
sighed
after
them
he
knew
warrington
was
a
baronet
son
and
he
looked
up
with
simple
reverence
to
all
the
aristocracy
pen
and
warrington
became
sworn
friends
from
that
night
warrington
cheerfulness
and
jovial
temper
his
good
sense
his
rough
welcome
and
his
pipe
of
tobacco
charmed
pen
who
found
it
more
pleasant
to
dive
into
shilling
taverns
with
him
than
to
dine
in
solitary
state
amongst
the
silent
and
polite
frequenters
of
the
polyanthus
ere
long
pen
gave
up
the
lodgings
in
james
to
which
he
had
migrated
on
quitting
his
hotel
and
found
it
was
much
more
economical
to
take
up
his
abode
with
warrington
in
lamb
court
and
furnish
and
occupy
his
friend
vacant
room
there
for
it
must
be
said
of
pen
that
no
man
was
more
easily
led
than
he
to
do
a
thing
when
it
was
a
novelty
or
when
he
had
a
mind
to
it
and
pidgeon
the
youth
and
flanagan
the
laundress
divided
their
allegiance
now
between
warrington
and
pen
chapter
xxxi
old
and
new
acquaintances
elated
with
the
idea
of
seeing
life
pen
went
into
a
hundred
queer
london
haunts
he
liked
to
think
he
was
consorting
with
all
sorts
of
men
so
he
beheld
coalheavers
in
their
boxers
in
their
honest
citizens
disporting
in
the
suburbs
or
on
the
river
and
he
would
have
liked
to
hob
and
nob
with
celebrated
pickpockets
or
drink
a
pot
of
ale
with
a
company
of
burglars
and
cracksmen
had
chance
afforded
him
an
opportunity
of
making
the
acquaintance
of
this
class
of
society
it
was
good
to
see
the
gravity
with
which
warrington
listened
to
the
tutbury
pet
or
the
brighton
stunner
at
the
champion
arms
and
behold
the
interest
which
he
took
in
the
coalheaving
company
assembled
at
the
his
acquaintance
with
the
of
the
metropolis
and
its
neighbourhood
and
with
the
frequenters
of
their
various
parlours
was
prodigious
he
was
the
personal
friend
of
the
landlord
and
landlady
and
welcome
to
the
bar
as
to
the
clubroom
he
liked
their
society
he
said
better
than
that
of
his
own
class
whose
manners
annoyed
him
and
whose
conversation
bored
him
in
society
he
used
to
say
everybody
is
the
same
wears
the
same
dress
eats
and
drinks
and
says
the
same
things
one
young
dandy
at
the
club
talks
and
looks
just
like
another
one
miss
at
a
ball
exactly
resembles
another
whereas
there
character
here
i
like
to
talk
with
the
strongest
man
in
england
or
the
man
who
can
drink
the
most
beer
in
england
or
with
that
tremendous
republican
of
a
hatter
who
thinks
thistlewood
was
the
greatest
character
in
history
i
like
better
than
claret
i
like
a
sanded
floor
in
carnaby
market
better
than
a
chalked
one
in
mayfair
i
prefer
snobs
i
own
indeed
this
gentleman
was
a
social
republican
and
it
never
entered
his
head
while
conversing
with
jack
and
tom
that
he
was
in
any
respect
their
better
although
perhaps
the
deference
which
they
paid
him
might
secretly
please
him
pen
followed
him
then
to
these
various
resorts
of
men
with
great
glee
and
assiduity
but
he
was
considerably
younger
and
therefore
much
more
pompous
and
stately
than
warrington
in
fact
a
young
prince
in
disguise
visiting
the
poor
of
his
father
kingdom
they
respected
him
as
a
high
chap
a
fine
fellow
a
regular
young
swell
he
had
somehow
about
him
an
air
of
imperious
and
a
royal
frankness
and
majesty
although
he
was
only
to
and
but
one
in
descent
from
a
gallypot
if
these
positions
are
made
for
us
we
acquiesce
in
them
very
easily
and
are
always
pretty
ready
to
assume
a
superiority
over
those
who
are
as
good
as
ourselves
pen
condescension
at
this
time
of
his
life
was
a
fine
thing
to
witness
amongst
men
of
ability
this
assumption
and
impertinence
passes
off
with
extreme
youth
but
it
is
curious
to
watch
the
conceit
of
a
generous
and
clever
lad
there
is
something
almost
touching
in
that
early
exhibition
of
simplicity
and
folly
so
after
reading
pretty
hard
of
a
morning
and
i
fear
not
law
merely
but
politics
and
general
history
and
literature
which
were
as
necessary
for
the
advancement
and
instruction
of
a
young
man
as
mere
dry
law
after
applying
with
tolerable
assiduity
to
letters
to
reviews
to
elemental
books
of
law
and
above
all
to
the
newspaper
until
the
hour
of
dinner
was
drawing
nigh
these
young
gentlemen
would
sally
out
upon
the
town
with
great
spirits
and
appetite
and
bent
upon
enjoying
a
merry
night
as
they
had
passed
a
pleasant
forenoon
it
was
a
jovial
time
that
of
when
every
muscle
of
mind
and
body
was
in
healthy
action
when
the
world
was
new
as
yet
and
one
moved
over
it
spurred
onwards
by
good
spirits
and
the
delightful
capability
to
enjoy
if
ever
we
feel
young
afterwards
it
is
with
the
comrades
of
that
time
the
tunes
we
hum
in
our
old
age
are
those
we
learned
then
sometimes
perhaps
the
festivity
of
that
period
revives
in
our
memory
but
how
dingy
the
has
grown
how
tattered
the
garlands
look
how
scant
and
old
the
company
and
what
a
number
of
the
lights
have
gone
out
since
that
day
grey
hairs
have
come
on
like
daylight
streaming
in
daylight
and
a
headache
with
it
pleasure
has
gone
to
bed
with
the
rouge
on
her
cheeks
well
friend
let
us
walk
through
the
day
sober
and
sad
but
friendly
i
wonder
what
laura
and
helen
would
have
said
could
they
have
seen
as
they
might
not
unfrequently
have
done
had
they
been
up
and
in
london
in
the
very
early
morning
when
the
bridges
began
to
blush
in
the
sunrise
and
the
tranquil
streets
of
the
city
to
shine
in
the
dawn
mr
pen
and
warrington
rattling
over
the
echoing
flags
towards
the
temple
after
one
of
their
wild
nights
of
carouse
nights
wild
but
not
so
wicked
as
such
nights
sometimes
are
for
warrington
was
a
and
pen
as
we
have
said
too
lofty
to
stoop
to
a
vulgar
intrigue
our
young
prince
of
fairoaks
never
could
speak
to
one
of
the
sex
but
with
respectful
courtesy
and
shrank
from
a
coarse
word
or
gesture
with
instinctive
delicacy
for
though
we
have
seen
him
fall
in
love
with
a
fool
as
his
betters
and
inferiors
have
done
and
as
it
is
probable
that
he
did
more
than
once
in
his
life
yet
for
the
time
of
the
delusion
it
was
always
as
a
goddess
that
he
considered
her
and
chose
to
wait
upon
her
men
serve
women
kneeling
when
they
get
on
their
feet
they
go
away
that
was
what
an
acquaintance
of
pen
said
to
him
in
his
hard
homely
way
an
old
friend
with
whom
he
had
fallen
in
again
in
london
no
other
than
honest
bows
of
the
chatteris
theatre
who
was
now
employed
as
pianoforte
player
to
accompany
the
eminent
lyrical
talent
which
nightly
delighted
the
public
at
the
fielding
head
in
covent
garden
and
where
was
held
the
little
club
called
the
back
kitchen
numbers
of
pen
friends
frequented
this
very
merry
meeting
the
fielding
head
had
been
a
house
of
entertainment
almost
since
the
time
when
the
famous
author
of
jones
presided
as
magistrate
in
the
neighbouring
bow
street
his
place
was
pointed
out
and
the
chair
said
to
have
been
his
still
occupied
by
the
president
of
the
entertainment
the
worthy
cutts
the
landlord
of
the
fielding
head
generally
occupied
this
post
when
not
disabled
by
gout
or
other
illness
his
jolly
appearance
and
fine
voice
may
be
remembered
by
some
of
my
male
readers
he
used
to
sing
profusely
in
the
course
of
the
harmonic
meeting
and
his
songs
were
of
what
may
be
called
the
british
school
of
song
such
as
good
old
english
gentleman
tom
this
brown
jug
and
so
forth
songs
in
which
pathos
and
hospitality
are
blended
and
the
praises
of
good
liquor
and
the
social
affections
are
chanted
in
a
baritone
voice
the
charms
of
our
women
the
heroic
deeds
of
our
naval
and
military
commanders
are
often
sung
in
the
ballads
of
this
school
and
many
a
time
in
my
youth
have
i
admired
how
cutts
the
singer
after
he
had
worked
us
all
up
to
patriotic
enthusiasm
by
describing
the
way
in
which
the
brave
abercrombie
received
his
or
made
us
join
him
in
tears
which
he
shed
liberally
himself
as
in
faltering
accents
he
told
how
autumn
falling
leaf
proclaimed
the
old
man
he
must
die
how
cutts
the
singer
became
at
once
cutts
the
landlord
and
before
the
applause
which
we
were
making
with
our
fists
on
his
table
in
compliment
to
his
melody
had
died
away
was
calling
now
gentlemen
give
your
orders
the
waiter
in
the
room
john
a
champagne
cup
for
green
i
think
sir
you
said
sausages
and
mashed
potatoes
john
attend
on
the
and
i
thank
ye
give
me
a
glass
of
punch
too
john
and
take
care
the
wather
boils
a
voice
would
cry
not
unfrequently
a
voice
to
pen
which
made
the
lad
blush
and
start
when
he
heard
it
first
that
of
the
venerable
captain
costigan
who
was
now
established
in
london
and
one
of
the
great
pillars
of
the
harmonic
meetings
at
the
head
the
captain
manners
and
conversation
brought
very
many
young
men
to
the
place
he
was
a
character
and
his
fame
had
begun
to
spread
soon
after
his
arrival
in
the
metropolis
and
especially
after
his
marriage
he
was
great
in
his
conversation
to
the
friend
for
the
time
being
who
was
the
neighbour
drinking
by
his
side
about
me
he
told
of
her
marriage
and
of
the
events
previous
and
subsequent
to
that
ceremony
of
the
carriages
she
kept
of
adoration
for
her
and
for
him
of
the
hundred
pounds
which
he
was
at
perfect
liberty
to
draw
from
his
whenever
necessity
urged
him
and
having
stated
that
it
was
his
firm
intention
to
dthraw
next
sathurday
i
give
ye
me
secred
word
and
honour
next
sathurday
the
fourteenth
when
ye
see
the
money
will
be
handed
over
to
me
at
coutts
the
very
instant
i
present
the
cheque
the
captain
would
not
unfrequently
propose
to
borrow
a
of
his
friend
until
the
arrival
of
that
day
of
greek
calends
when
on
the
honour
of
an
officer
and
gentleman
he
would
repee
the
thrifling
obligetion
sir
charles
mirabel
had
not
that
enthusiastic
attachment
to
his
of
which
the
latter
sometimes
boasted
although
in
other
stages
of
emotion
cos
would
inveigh
with
tears
in
his
eyes
against
the
ingratitude
of
the
child
of
his
bosom
and
the
stinginess
of
the
wealthy
old
man
who
had
married
her
but
the
pair
had
acted
not
unkindly
towards
costigan
had
settled
a
small
pension
on
him
which
was
paid
regularly
and
forestalled
with
even
more
regularity
by
poor
cos
and
the
period
of
the
payments
was
always
well
known
by
his
friend
at
the
fielding
head
whither
the
honest
captain
took
care
to
repair
in
hand
calling
loudly
for
change
in
the
midst
of
the
full
harmonic
meeting
i
think
ye
find
that
note
wo
be
refused
at
the
bank
of
england
cutts
my
boy
captain
costigan
would
say
bows
have
a
glass
ye
need
stint
yourself
anyhow
and
a
glass
of
punch
will
make
ye
play
con
for
he
was
lavishly
free
with
his
money
when
it
came
to
him
and
was
scarcely
known
to
button
his
breeches
pocket
except
when
the
coin
was
gone
or
sometimes
indeed
when
a
creditor
came
by
it
was
in
one
of
these
moments
of
exultation
that
pen
found
his
old
friend
swaggering
at
the
singers
table
at
the
back
kitchen
of
the
fielding
head
and
ordering
glasses
of
for
any
of
his
acquaintances
who
made
their
appearance
in
the
apartment
warrington
who
was
on
confidential
terms
with
the
bass
singer
made
his
way
up
to
this
quarter
of
the
room
and
pen
walked
at
his
friend
heels
pen
started
and
blushed
to
see
costigan
he
had
just
come
from
lady
whiston
party
where
he
had
met
and
spoken
with
the
captain
daughter
again
for
the
first
time
after
very
old
old
days
he
came
up
with
outstretched
hand
very
kindly
and
warmly
to
greet
the
old
man
still
retaining
a
strong
remembrance
of
the
time
when
costigan
daughter
had
been
everything
in
the
world
to
him
for
though
this
young
gentleman
may
have
been
somewhat
capricious
in
his
attachments
and
occasionally
have
transferred
his
affections
from
one
woman
to
another
yet
he
always
respected
the
place
where
love
had
dwelt
and
like
the
sultan
of
turkey
desired
that
honours
should
be
paid
to
the
lady
towards
whom
he
had
once
thrown
the
royal
the
tipsy
captain
returning
the
clasp
of
pen
hand
with
all
the
strength
of
a
palm
which
had
become
very
shaky
by
the
constant
lifting
up
of
weights
of
looked
hard
in
pen
face
and
said
grecious
heavens
is
it
possible
me
dear
boy
me
dear
fellow
me
dear
friend
and
then
with
a
look
of
muddled
curiosity
fairly
broke
down
with
i
know
your
face
me
dear
dear
friend
but
bedad
i
forgot
your
five
years
of
constant
punch
had
passed
since
pen
and
costigan
met
arthur
was
a
good
deal
changed
and
the
captain
may
surly
be
excused
for
forgetting
him
when
a
man
at
the
actual
moment
sees
things
double
we
may
expect
that
his
view
of
the
past
will
be
rather
muzzy
pen
saw
his
condition
and
laughed
although
perhaps
he
was
somewhat
mortified
do
you
remember
me
captain
he
said
i
am
pendennis
arthur
pendennis
of
the
sound
of
the
young
man
friendly
voice
recalled
and
steadied
tipsy
remembrance
and
he
saluted
arthur
as
soon
as
he
knew
him
with
a
loud
volley
of
friendly
greetings
pen
was
his
dearest
boy
his
gallant
young
friend
his
noble
collagian
whom
he
had
held
in
his
inmost
heart
ever
since
they

very
well
said
the
captain
jingling
his
money
and
whistling
the
air
of
a
song
little
doodeen
for
the
singing
of
which
he
was
celebrated
at
the
fielding
head
me

of
and
so
the
captain
went
maundering
on
it
with
the
general
said
hodgen
the
bass
singer
with
whom
warrington
was
in
deep
conversation
and
he
a
precious
deal
more
than
half
seas
over
he
has
already
tried
that
doodeen
of
his
and
broke
it
too
just
before
i
sang
death
have
you
heard
my
new
song
body
snatcher
mr
warrington
angcored
at
saint
bartholomew
the
other
night
composed
expressly
for
me
you
or

copy
of
the
song

kyndness

snatcher

a
portrait
of
me
sir
as
i
sing
it
as
the
snatcher
considered
rather
thank
you
said
warrington
heard
it
nine
times
know
it
by
heart
here
the
gentleman
who
presided
at
the
pianoforte
began
to
play
upon
his
instrument
and
pen
looking
in
the
direction
of
the
music
beheld
that
very
bows
for
whom
he
had
been
asking
but
now
and
whose
existence
costigan
had
momentarily
forgotten
the
little
old
man
sate
before
the
battered
piano
which
had
injured
its
constitution
wofully
by
sitting
up
so
many
nights
and
spoke
with
a
voice
as
it
were
at
once
hoarse
and
faint
and
accompanied
the
singers
or
played
with
taste
and
grace
in
the
intervals
of
the
songs
bows
had
seen
and
recollected
pen
at
once
when
the
latter
came
into
the
room
and
had
remarked
the
eager
warmth
of
the
young
man
recognition
of
costigan
he
now
began
to
play
an
air
which
pen
instantly
remembered
as
one
which
used
to
be
sung
by
the
chorus
of
villagers
in
stranger
just
before
haller
came
in
it
shook
pen
as
he
heard
it
he
remembered
how
his
heart
used
to
beat
as
that
air
was
played
and
before
the
divine
emily
made
her
entry
nobody
save
arthur
took
any
notice
of
old
bows
playing
it
was
scarcely
heard
amidst
the
clatter
of
knives
and
forks
the
calls
for
poached
eggs
and
kidneys
and
the
tramp
of
guests
and
waiters
pen
went
up
and
kindly
shook
the
player
by
the
hand
at
the
end
of
his
performance
and
bows
greeted
arthur
with
great
respect
and
cordiality
what
you
have
forgot
the
old
tune
pendennis
he
said
i
thought
you
remember
it
i
take
it
it
was
the
first
tune
of
that
sort
you
ever
heard
played
was
it
sir
you
were
quite
a
young
chap
then
i
fear
the
captain
very
bad
he
breaks
out
on
a
and
i
shall
have
the
deuce
own
trouble
in
getting
home
we
live
together
we
still
hang
on
sir
in
partnership
though
miss
em
though
my
lady
mirabel
has
left
the
and
so
you
remember
old
times
do
you
was
she
a
beauty
sir
your
health
and
my
service
to
you
and
he
took
a
sip
at
the
pewter
measure
of
porter
which
stood
by
his
side
as
he
played
pen
had
many
opportunities
of
seeing
his
early
acquaintance
afterwards
and
of
renewing
his
relations
with
costigan
and
the
old
musician
as
they
sate
thus
in
friendly
colloquy
men
of
all
sorts
and
conditions
entered
and
quitted
the
house
of
entertainment
and
pen
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
as
many
different
persons
of
his
race
as
the
most
eager
observer
need
desire
to
inspect
healthy
country
tradesmen
and
farmers
in
london
for
their
business
came
and
recreated
themselves
with
the
jolly
singing
and
suppers
of
the
back
kitchen
squads
of
young
apprentices
and
assistants
the
shutters
being
closed
over
the
scene
of
their
labours
came
hither
for
fresh
air
doubtless
rakish
young
medical
students
gallant
dashing
what
is
called
loudly
dressed
and
must
it
be
owned
somewhat
dirty
were
here
smoking
and
drinking
and
vociferously
applauding
the
songs
young
university
bucks
were
to
be
found
here
too
with
that
indescribable
genteel
simper
which
is
only
learned
at
the
knees
of
alma
mater
and
handsome
young
guardsmen
and
florid
bucks
from
the
james
street
clubs
nay
senators
english
and
irish
and
even
members
of
the
house
of
peers
the
bass
singer
had
made
an
immense
hit
with
his
song
of
body
snatcher
and
the
town
rushed
to
listen
to
it
the
curtain
drew
aside
and
hodgen
appeared
in
the
character
of
the
snatcher
sitting
on
a
coffin
with
a
flask
of
gin
before
him
with
a
spade
and
a
candle
stuck
in
a
skull
the
song
was
sung
with
a
really
admirable
terrific
humour
the
singer
voice
went
down
so
low
that
its
grumbles
rumbled
into
the
hearer
soul
and
in
the
chorus
he
clamped
with
his
spade
and
gave
a
demoniac
ha
ha
which
caused
the
very
glasses
to
quiver
on
the
table
as
with
terror
none
of
the
other
singers
not
even
cutts
himself
as
that
man
owned
could
stand
up
before
the
snatcher
and
he
commonly
used
to
retire
to
cutts
private
apartments
or
into
the
bar
before
that
fatal
song
extinguished
him
poor
cos
ditty
little
doodeen
which
bows
accompanied
charmingly
on
the
piano
was
sung
but
to
a
few
admirers
who
might
choose
to
remain
after
the
tremendous
resurrectionist
chant
the
room
was
commonly
emptied
after
that
or
only
left
in
possession
of
a
very
few
and
persevering
votaries
of
pleasure
whilst
pen
and
his
friend
were
sitting
here
together
one
night
or
rather
morning
two
habitues
of
the
house
entered
almost
together
mr
hoolan
and
doolan
whispered
warrington
to
pen
saluting
these
gentlemen
and
in
the
latter
pen
recognised
his
friend
of
the
alacrity
coach
who
could
not
dine
with
pen
on
the
day
on
which
the
latter
had
invited
him
being
compelled
by
his
professional
duties
to
decline
on
fridays
he
had
stated
with
his
compliments
to
pendennis
doolan
paper
the
dawn
was
lying
on
the
table
much
bestained
by
porter
and
with
hoolan
paper
which
we
shall
call
the
day
the
dawn
was
liberal
the
day
was
many
of
our
journals
are
officered
by
irish
gentlemen
and
their
gallant
brigade
does
the
penning
among
us
as
their
ancestors
used
to
transact
the
fighting
in
europe
and
engage
under
many
a
flag
to
be
good
friends
when
the
battle
is
over
kidneys
john
and
a
glass
of
stout

hoolan

for
our
georgy

the
measles
said
the
friendly
morgan
and
they
straightway
fell
to
talk
about
matters
connected
with
their
trade
about
the
foreign
mails
about
who
was
correspondent
at
paris
and
who
wrote
from
madrid
about
the
expense
the
morning
journal
was
at
in
sending
couriers
about
the
circulation
of
the
evening
star
and
so
forth
warrington
laughing
took
the
dawn
which
was
lying
before
him
and
pointed
to
one
of
the
leading
articles
in
that
journal
which
commenced
thus
as
rogues
of
note
in
former
days
who
had
some
wicked
work
to
perform
an
enemy
to
be
put
out
of
the
way
a
quantity
of
false
coin
to
be
passed
a
lie
to
be
told
or
a
murder
to
be
done
employed
a
professional
perjurer
or
assassin
to
do
the
work
which
they
were
themselves
too
notorious
or
too
cowardly
to
execute
our
notorious
contemporary
the
day
engages
smashers
out
of
doors
to
utter
forgeries
against
individuals
and
calls
in
auxiliary
to
murder
the
reputation
of
those
who
offend
him
a
ruffian
whom
we
will
unmask
who
signs
the
forged
name
of
trefoil
is
at
present
one
of
the
chief
bravoes
and
bullies
in
our
contemporary
establishment
he
is
the
eunuch
who
brings
the
bowstring
and
strangles
at
the
order
of
the
day
we
can
convict
this
cowardly
slave
and
propose
to
do
so
the
charge
which
he
has
brought
against
lord
bangbanagher
because
he
is
a
liberal
irish
peer
and
against
the
board
of
poor
law
guardians
of
the
bangbanagher
union
is
etc
how
did
they
like
the
article
at
your
place
mick
asked
morgan
when
the
captain
puts
his
hand
to
it
he
a
tremendous
hand
at
a
smasher
he
wrote
the
article
in
two
hours
in
whew
you
know
where
while
the
boy
was
our
governor
thinks
the
public
do
mind
a
straw
about
these
newspaper
rows
and
has
told
the
docthor
to
stop
answering
said
the
other
them
two
talked
it
out
together
in
my
room
the
docthor
would
have
liked
a
turn
for
he
says
it
such
easy
writing
and
requires
no
reading
up
of
a
subject
but
the
governor
put
a
stopper
on
the
taste
for
eloquence
is
going
out
mick
said
morgan
then
it
is
morgan
said
mick
that
was
fine
writing
when
the
docthor
wrote
in
the
phaynix
and
he
and
condy
roony
blazed
away
at
each
other
day
after
and
with
powder
and
shot
too
as
well
as
paper
says
morgan
faith
the
docthor
was
out
twice
and
condy
roony
winged
his
they
are
talking
about
doctor
boyne
and
captain
shandon
warrington
said
who
are
the
two
irish
controversialists
of
the
dawn
and
the
day
boyne
being
the
protestant
champion
and
captain
shandon
the
liberal
orator
they
are
the
best
friends
in
the
world
i
believe
in
spite
of
their
newspaper
controversies
and
though
they
cry
out
against
the
english
for
abusing
their
country
by
jove
they
abuse
it
themselves
more
in
a
single
article
than
we
should
take
the
pains
to
do
in
a
dozen
volumes
how
are
you
doolan
your
servant
warrington
pendennis
i
am
delighted
to
have
the
honour
of
seeing
ye
again
the
night
journey
on
the
top
of
the
alacrity
was
one
of
the
most
agreeable
i
ever
enjoyed
in
my
life
and
it
was
your
liveliness
and
urbanity
that
made
the
trip
so
charming
i
have
often
thought
over
that
happy
night
sir
and
talked
over
it
to
doolan
i
have
seen
your
elegant
young
friend
foker
too
here
sir
not
unfrequently
he
is
an
occasional
frequenter
of
this
hostelry
and
a
right
good
one

saw
you

on
the
tom
and
jerry
weekly
paper
i
have
now
the
honour
to
be
of
the
dawn
one
of
the
papers
of
the
empire
and
he
bowed
very
slightly
to
warrington
his
speech
was
unctuous
and
measured
his
courtesy
oriental
his
tone
when
talking
with
the
two
englishmen
quite
different
to
that
with
which
he
spoke
to
his
comrade
why
the
devil
will
the
fellow
compliment
so
growled
warrington
with
a
sneer
which
he
hardly
took
the
pains
to
suppress

know
pen
uncle
the
major
archer
you
who
know
everybody
dined
with
him
the
day
before
yesterday
at
gaunt
house
archer
said
we
were
four
the
french
ambassador
steyne
and
we
two
why
my
uncle
is
in
scot
pen
was
going
to
break
out
but
warrington
pressed
his
foot
under
the
table
as
a
signal
for
him
to
be
quiet
it
was
about
the
same
business
that
i
have
been
to
the
palace
archer
went
on
simply
and
where
i
been
kept
four
hours
in
an
anteroom
with
nothing
but
yesterday
times
which
i
knew
by
heart
as
i
wrote
three
of
the
leading
articles
myself
and
though
the
lord
chamberlain
came
in
four
times
and
once
holding
the
royal
teacup
and
saucer
in
his
hand
he
did
not
so
much
as
say
to
me
will
you
have
a
cup
of
tea
indeed
what
is
in
the
wind
now
asked
warrington
and
turning
to
pen
added
you
know
i
suppose
that
when
there
is
anything
wrong
at
court
they
always
send
for
there
is
something
wrong
said
archer
and
as
the
story
will
be
all
over
the
town
in
a
day
or
two
i
do
mind
telling
it
at
the
last
chantilly
races
where
i
rode
brian
boru
for
my
old
friend
the
duke
de
saint
cloud
the
old
king
said
to
me
archer
i
uneasy
about
saint
cloud
i
have
arranged
his
marriage
with
the
princess
marie
cunegonde
the
peace
of
europe
depends
upon
it
for
russia
will
declare
war
if
the
marriage
does
not
take
place
and
the
young
fool
is
so
mad
about
madame
massena
marshal
massena
wife
that
he
actually
refuses
to
be
a
party
to
the
marriage
well
sir
i
spoke
to
saint
cloud
and
having
got
him
into
pretty
good
humour
by
winning
the
race
and
a
good
bit
of
money
into
the
bargain
he
said
to
me
tell
the
governor
i
think
of
it
how
do
you
say
governor
in
french
asked
pen
who
piqued
himself
on
knowing
that
language
oh
we
speak
in
english
i
taught
him
when
we
were
boys
and
i
saved
his
life
at
twickenham
when
he
fell
out
of
a
punt
archer
said
i
shall
never
forget
the
queen
looks
as
i
brought
him
out
of
the
water
she
gave
me
this
diamond
ring
and
always
calls
me
charles
to
this
madame
massena
must
be
rather
an
old
woman
archer
warrington
said
old
old
enough
to
be
his
grandmother
i
told
him
so
archer
answered
at
once
but
those
attachments
for
old
women
are
the
deuce
and
all
that
what
the
king
feels
that
what
shocks
the
poor
queen
so
much
they
went
away
from
paris
last
tuesday
night
and
are
living
at
this
present
moment
at
jaunay
has
there
been
a
private
marriage
archer
asked
warrington
whether
there
has
or
not
i
do
know
archer
replied
all
i
know
is
that
i
was
kept
waiting
for
four
hours
at
the
palace
that
i
never
saw
a
man
in
such
a
state
of
agitation
as
the
king
of
belgium
when
he
came
out
to
speak
to
me
and
that
i
devilish
hungry
and
here
comes
some
he
has
been
pretty
well
said
warrington
as
the
pair
went
home
together
but
i
have
known
him
in
much
greater
force
and
keeping
a
whole
room
in
a
state
of
wonder
put
aside
his
archery
practice
that
man
is
both
able
and
honest
a
good
man
of
business
an
excellent
friend
admirable
to
his
family
as
husband
father
and
what
is
it
makes
him
pull
the
long
bow
in
that
wonderful
manner
an
amiable
insanity
answered
warrington
he
never
did
anybody
harm
by
his
talk
or
said
evil
of
anybody
he
is
a
stout
politician
too
and
would
never
write
a
word
or
do
an
act
against
his
party
as
many
of
us
of
us
who
are
we
asked
pen
of
what
profession
is
archer
of
the
corporation
of
the
goosequill
of
the
press
my
boy
said
warrington
of
the
fourth
are
you
too
of
the
craft
then
pendennis
said
we
will
talk
about
that
another
time
answered
the
other
they
were
passing
through
the
strand
as
they
talked
and
by
a
newspaper
office
which
was
all
lighted
up
and
bright
reporters
were
coming
out
of
the
place
or
rushing
up
to
it
in
cabs
there
were
lamps
burning
in
the
editors
rooms
and
above
where
the
compositors
were
at
work
the
windows
of
the
building
were
in
a
blaze
of
gas
look
at
that
pen
warrington
said
there
she
is
the
great
engine
she
never
sleeps
she
has
her
ambassadors
in
every
quarter
of
the
world
her
couriers
upon
every
road
her
officers
march
along
with
armies
and
her
envoys
walk
into
statesmen
cabinets
they
are
ubiquitous
yonder
journal
has
an
agent
at
this
minute
giving
bribes
at
madrid
and
another
inspecting
the
price
of
potatoes
in
covent
garden
look
here
comes
the
foreign
express
galloping
in
they
will
be
able
to
give
news
to
downing
street
funds
will
rise
or
fall
fortunes
be
made
or
lost
lord
will
get
up
and
holding
the
paper
in
his
hand
and
seeing
the
noble
marquis
in
his
place
will
make
a
great
speech
and
and
doolan
will
be
called
away
from
his
supper
at
the
back
kitchen
for
he
is
foreign
and
sees
the
mail
on
the
newspaper
sheet
before
he
goes
to
his
and
so
talking
the
friends
turned
into
their
chambers
as
the
dawn
was
beginning
to
peep
chapter
xxxii
in
which
the
printer
devil
comes
to
the
door
pen
in
the
midst
of
his
revels
and
enjoyments
humble
as
they
were
and
moderate
in
cost
if
not
in
kind
saw
an
awful
sword
hanging
over
him
which
must
drop
down
before
long
and
put
an
end
to
his
frolics
and
feasting
his
money
was
very
nearly
spent
his
club
subscription
had
carried
away
a
third
part
of
it
he
had
paid
for
the
chief
articles
of
furniture
with
which
he
had
supplied
his
little
bedroom
in
fine
he
was
come
to
the
last
note
in
his
and
could
think
of
no
method
of
providing
a
successor
for
our
friend
had
been
bred
up
like
a
young
prince
as
yet
or
as
a
child
in
arms
whom
his
mother
feeds
when
it
cries
out
warrington
did
not
know
what
his
comrade
means
were
an
only
child
with
a
mother
at
her
country
house
and
an
old
dandy
of
an
uncle
who
dined
with
a
great
man
every
day
pen
might
have
a
large
bank
at
his
command
for
anything
that
the
other
knew
he
had
gold
chains
and
a
fit
for
a
lord
his
habits
were
those
of
an
aristocrat
not
that
he
was
expensive
upon
any
particular
point
for
he
dined
and
laughed
over
the
pint
of
porter
and
the
plate
of
beef
from
the
cook
shop
with
perfect
content
and
good
appetite
but
he
could
not
adopt
the
precautions
of
life
he
could
not
give
twopence
to
a
waiter
he
could
not
refrain
from
taking
a
cab
if
he
had
a
mind
to
do
so
or
if
it
rained
and
as
surely
as
he
took
the
cab
he
overpaid
the
driver
he
had
a
scorn
for
cleaned
gloves
and
minor
economies
had
he
been
bred
to
ten
thousand
a
year
he
could
scarcely
have
been
more
and
for
a
beggar
with
a
sad
story
or
a
couple
of
pretty
children
he
never
could
resist
putting
his
hand
into
his
pocket
it
was
a
sumptuous
nature
perhaps
that
could
not
be
brought
to
regard
money
a
natural
generosity
and
kindness
and
possibly
a
petty
vanity
that
was
pleased
with
praise
even
with
the
praise
of
waiters
and
cabmen
i
doubt
whether
the
wisest
of
us
know
what
our
own
motives
are
and
whether
some
of
the
actions
of
which
we
are
the
very
proudest
will
not
surprise
us
when
we
trace
them
as
we
shall
one
day
to
their
source
warrington
then
did
not
know
and
pen
had
not
thought
proper
to
confide
to
his
friend
his
pecuniary
history
that
pen
had
been
wild
and
wickedly
extravagant
at
college
the
other
was
aware
everybody
at
college
was
extravagant
and
wild
but
how
great
the
son
expenses
had
been
and
how
small
the
mother
means
were
points
which
had
not
been
as
yet
submitted
to
warrington
examination
at
last
the
story
came
out
while
pen
was
grimly
surveying
the
change
for
the
last
note
as
it
lay
upon
the
tray
from
the
by
warrington
pot
of
ale
it
is
the
last
rose
of
summer
said
pen
its
blooming
companions
have
gone
long
ago
and
behold
the
last
one
of
the
garland
has
shed
its
leaves
and
he
told
warrington
the
whole
story
which
we
know
of
his
mother
means
of
his
own
follies
of
laura
generosity
during
which
time
warrington
smoked
his
pipe
and
listened
intent
impecuniosity
will
do
you
good
pen

said
knocking
out
the
ashes
at
the
end
of
the
narration

wholesome

honest

its

is
an
alterative

a
tonic
it
keeps
your
moral
man
in
a
perpetual
state
of
excitement

a
man

is
riding
at

has
his

forced
to
look
his
obstacle

in

our

said
every
man
has
his
secrets
look
you
before
you
told
me
the
story
of
your
i
had
no
idea
but
that
you
were
a
gentleman
of
fortune
for
with
your
confounded
airs
and
appearance
anybody
would
suppose
you
to
be
so
from
what
you
tell
me
about
your
mother
income
it
is
clear
that
you
must
not
lay
any
more
hands
on
it
you
ca
go
on
spunging
upon
the
women
you
must
pay
off
that
trump
of
a
girl
laura
is
her
name
here
is
your
health
laura
and
carry
a
hod
rather
than
ask
for
a
shilling
from
but
how
earn
one
asked
pen
how
do
i
live
think
you
said
the
other
on
my
younger
allowance
pendennis
i
have
secrets
of
my
own
my
boy
and
here
warrington
countenance
fell
i
made
away
with
that
allowance
five
years
ago
if
i
had
made
away
with
myself
a
little
time
before
it
would
have
been
better
i
have
played
off
my
own
bat
ever
since
i
do
want
much
money
when
my
purse
is
out
i
go
to
work
and
fill
it
and
then
lie
idle
like
a
serpent
or
an
indian
until
i
have
digested
the
mass
look
i
begin
to
feel
empty
warrington
said
and
showed
pen
a
long
lean
purse
with
but
a
few
sovereigns
at
one
end
of
it
but
how
do
you
fill
it
said
pen
i
write
said
warrington
i
do
tell
the
world
that
i
do
so
he
added
with
a
blush
i
do
not
choose
that
questions
should
be
asked
or
perhaps
i
am
an
ass
and
do
wish
it
to
be
said
that
george
warrington
writes
for
bread
but
i
write
in
the
law
reviews
look
here
these
articles
are
and
he
turned
over
some
sheets
i
write
in
a
newspaper
now
and
then
of
which
a
friend
of
mine
is
and
warrington
going
with
pendennis
to
the
club
one
day
called
for
a
file
of
the
dawn
and
pointed
with
his
finger
silently
to
one
or
two
articles
which
pen
read
with
delight
he
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
the
style
afterwards
the
strong
thoughts
and
curt
periods
the
sense
the
satire
and
the
scholarship
i
am
not
up
to
this
said
pen
with
a
genuine
admiration
of
his
friend
powers
i
know
very
little
about
politics
or
history
warrington
and
have
but
a
smattering
of
letters
i
ca
fly
upon
such
a
wing
as
but
you
can
on
your
own
my
boy
which
is
lighter
and
soars
higher
perhaps
the
other
said
those
little
scraps
and
verses
which
i
have
seen
of
yours
show
me
what
is
rare
in
these
days
a
natural
gift
sir
you
need
blush
you
conceited
young
jackanapes
you
have
thought
so
yourself
any
time
these
ten
years
you
have
got
the
sacred
flame
a
little
of
the
real
poetical
fire
sir
i
think
and
all
our
are
nothing
compared
to
that
though
ever
so
well
trimmed
you
are
a
poet
pen
my
boy
and
so
speaking
warrington
stretched
out
his
broad
hand
and
clapped
pen
on
the
shoulder
arthur
was
so
delighted
that
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
how
kind
you
are
to
me
warrington
he
said
i
like
you
old
boy
said
the
other
i
was
lonely
in
chambers
and
wanted
somebody
and
the
sight
of
your
honest
face
somehow
pleased
me
i
liked
the
way
you
laughed
at
lowton
that
poor
good
little
snob
and
in
fine
the
reason
why
i
can
not
tell
but
so
it
is
young
i
alone
in
the
world
sir
and
i
wanted
some
one
to
keep
me
company
and
a
glance
of
extreme
kindness
and
melancholy
passed
out
of
warrington
dark
eyes
pen
was
too
much
pleased
with
his
own
thoughts
to
perceive
the
sadness
of
the
friend
who
was
complimenting
him
thank
you
warrington
he
said
thank
you
for
your
friendship
to
me
and
and
what
you
say
about
me
i
have
often
thought
i
was
a
poet
i
will
be
one
i
think
i
am
one
as
you
say
so
though
the
world
may
is
it
is
it
the
ariadne
in
naxos
which
you
liked
i
was
only
eighteen
when
i
wrote
it
or
the
prize
poem
warrington
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
why
young
goose
he
yelled
out
of
all
the
miserable
weak
rubbish
i
ever
tried
ariadne
in
naxos
is
the
most
mawkish
and
disgusting
the
prize
poem
is
so
pompous
and
feeble
that
i
positively
surprised
sir
it
did
get
the
medal
you
do
suppose
that
you
are
a
serious
poet
do
you
and
are
going
to
cut
out
milton
and
aeschylus
are
you
setting
up
to
be
a
pindar
you
absurd
little
and
fancy
you
have
the
strength
and
pinion
which
the
theban
eagle
bear
sailing
with
supreme
dominion
through
the
azure
fields
of
air
no
my
boy
i
think
you
can
write
a
magazine
article
and
turn
a
pretty
copy
of
verses
that
what
i
think
of
by
jove
said
pen
bouncing
up
and
stamping
his
foot
i
show
you
that
i
am
a
better
man
than
you
think
warrington
only
laughed
the
more
and
blew
puffs
rapidly
out
of
his
pipe
by
way
of
reply
to
pen
an
opportunity
for
showing
his
skill
presented
itself
before
very
long
that
eminent
publisher
bacon
formerly
bacon
and
bungay
of
paternoster
row
besides
being
the
proprietor
of
the
legal
review
in
which
warrington
wrote
and
of
other
periodicals
of
note
and
gravity
used
to
present
to
the
world
every
year
a
beautiful
gilt
volume
called
the
spring
annual
edited
by
the
lady
violet
lebas
and
numbering
amongst
its
contributors
not
only
the
most
eminent
but
the
most
fashionable
poets
of
our
time
young
lord
dodo
poems
first
appeared
in
this
miscellany
the
honourable
percy
popjoy
whose
chivalrous
ballads
have
obtained
him
such
a
reputation
bedwin
sands
eastern
ghazuls
and
many
more
of
the
works
of
our
young
nobles
were
fast
given
to
the
world
in
the
spring
annual
which
has
since
shared
the
fate
of
other
vernal
blossoms
and
perished
out
of
the
world
the
book
was
daintily
illustrated
with
pictures
of
reigning
beauties
or
other
prints
of
a
tender
and
voluptuous
character
and
as
these
plates
were
prepared
long
beforehand
requiring
much
time
in
engraving
it
was
the
eminent
poets
who
had
to
write
to
the
plates
and
not
the
painters
who
illustrated
the
poems
one
day
just
when
this
volume
was
on
the
eve
of
publication
it
chanced
that
warrington
called
in
paternoster
row
to
talk
with
hack
bacon
reader
and
general
manager
of
publications
for
bacon
not
having
the
least
taste
in
poetry
or
in
literature
of
any
kind
wisely
employed
the
services
of
a
professional
gentleman
warrington
then
going
into
hack
room
on
business
of
his
own
found
that
gentleman
with
a
bundle
of
proof
plates
and
sheets
of
the
spring
annual
before
him
and
glanced
at
some
of
them
percy
popjoy
had
written
some
verses
to
illustrate
one
of
the
pictures
which
was
called
the
church
porch
a
spanish
damsel
was
hastening
to
church
with
a
large
a
youth
in
a
cloak
was
hidden
in
a
niche
watching
this
young
woman
the
picture
was
pretty
but
the
great
genius
of
percy
popjoy
had
deserted
him
for
he
had
made
the
most
execrable
verses
which
ever
were
perpetrated
by
a
young
nobleman
warrington
burst
out
laughing
as
he
read
the
poem
and
hack
laughed
too
but
with
rather
a
rueful
it
wo
do
he
said
the
public
wo
stand
it
bungay
people
are
going
to
bring
out
a
very
good
book
and
have
set
up
miss
bunyan
against
lady
violet
we
have
most
titles
to
be
sure
but
the
verses
are
too
bad
lady
violet
herself
owns
it
busy
with
her
own
poem
what
to
be
done
we
ca
lose
the
plate
the
governor
gave
sixty
pounds
for
i
know
a
fellow
who
would
do
some
verses
i
think
said
warrington
let
me
take
the
plate
home
in
my
pocket
and
send
to
my
chambers
in
the
morning
for
the
verses
you
pay
well
of
of
course
said
hack
and
warrington
having
despatched
his
own
business
went
home
to
mr
pen
plate
in
hand
now
boy
here
a
chance
for
you
turn
me
off
a
copy
of
verses
to
what
this
a
church
porch
a
lady
entering
it
and
a
youth
out
of
a
window
ogling
what
the
deuce
am
i
to
do
with
it
try
said
warrington
earn
your
livelihood
for
once
you
who
long
so
to
do
well
i
will
try
said
pen
and
i
go
out
to
dinner
said
warrington
and
left
mr
pen
in
a
brown
study
when
warrington
came
home
that
night
at
a
very
late
hour
the
verses
were
done
there
they
are
said
pen
i
screwed
out
at
last
i
think
they
i
think
they
will
said
warrington
after
reading
them
they
ran
as
follows
the
church
porch
although
i
enter
not
yet
round
about
the
spot
sometimes
i
hover
and
at
the
sacred
gate
with
longing
eyes
i
wait
expectant
of
her
the
minster
bell
tolls
out
above
the
city
rout
and
noise
and
humming
they
stopp
the
chiming
bell
i
hear
the
organ
swell
she
coming
she
coming
my
lady
comes
at
last
timid
and
stepping
fast
and
hastening
hither
with
modest
eyes
downcast
she
comes
she
here
she
past
may
heaven
go
with
her
kneel
undisturb
fair
saint
pour
out
your
praise
or
plaint
meekly
and
duly
i
will
not
enter
there
to
sully
your
pure
prayer
with
thoughts
unruly
but
suffer
me
to
pace
round
the
forbidden
place
lingering
a
minute
like
outcast
spirits
who
wait
and
see
through
heaven
gate
angels
within
it
have
you
got
any
more
young
fellow
asked
warrington
we
must
make
them
give
you
a
couple
of
guineas
a
page
and
if
the
verses
are
liked
why
you
get
an
entree
into
bacon
magazines
and
may
turn
a
decent
pen
examined
his
portfolio
and
found
another
ballad
which
he
thought
might
figure
with
advantage
in
the
spring
annual
and
consigning
these
two
precious
documents
to
warrington
the
pair
walked
from
the
temple
to
the
famous
haunt
of
the
muses
and
their
masters
paternoster
row
bacon
shop
was
an
ancient
building
with
a
few
of
the
books
published
by
the
firm
displayed
in
the
windows
under
a
bust
of
my
lord
of
verulam
and
the
name
of
bacon
in
brass
on
the
private
door
exactly
opposite
to
bacon
house
was
that
of
bungay
which
was
newly
painted
and
elaborately
decorated
in
the
style
of
the
seventeenth
century
so
that
you
might
have
fancied
stately
evelyn
passing
over
the
threshold
or
curious
pepys
examining
the
books
in
the
window
warrington
went
into
the
shop
of
bacon
but
pen
stayed
without
it
was
agreed
that
his
ambassador
should
act
for
him
entirely
and
the
young
fellow
paced
up
and
down
the
street
in
a
very
nervous
condition
until
he
should
learn
the
result
of
the
negotiation
many
a
poor
devil
before
him
has
trodden
those
flags
with
similar
cares
and
anxieties
at
his
heels
his
bread
and
his
fame
dependent
upon
the
sentence
of
his
magnanimous
patrons
of
the
row
pen
looked
at
all
the
wonders
of
all
the
shops
and
the
strange
variety
of
literature
which
they
exhibit
in
this
were
displayed
volumes
and
books
in
the
clear
pale
types
of
aldus
and
elzevir
in
the
next
you
might
see
the
penny
horrific
register
the
halfpenny
annals
of
crime
and
history
of
the
most
celebrated
murderers
of
all
countries
the
raff

the
larky
swell
and
other
publications
of
the
penny
press
whilst
at
the
next
window
portraits
of

with

the
venerated
signatures
of
the
reverend
grimes
wapshot
the
reverend
elias
howle

the

preached
by

the
british

he
could

be
a
little
casement
hung
with
emblems
with
medals
and
rosaries
with
little
paltry
prints
of
saints
gilt
and
painted
and
books
of
controversial
theology
by
which
the
faithful
of

opinion
might
learn
a
short
way
to
deal
with
protestants
at
a
penny
apiece
or
ninepence
the
dozen
for

whilst
in
the
very
next
window
you
might
see
out
of
rome
a
sermon
preached
at
the
opening
of
the
shepherd
bush
college
by
john
thomas
lord
bishop
of
ealing
scarce
an
opinion
but
has
its
expositor
and
its
place
of
exhibition
in
this
peaceful
old
paternoster
row
under
the
toll
of
the
bells
of
saint
paul
pen
looked
in
at
all
the
windows
and
shops
as
a
gentleman
who
is
going
to
have
an
interview
with
the
dentist
examines
the
books
on
the
table
he
remembered
them
afterwards
it
seemed
to
him
that
warrington
would
never
come
out
and
indeed
the
latter
was
engaged
for
some
time
in
pleading
his
friend
cause
pen
natural
conceit
would
have
swollen
immensely
if
he
could
but
have
heard
the
report
which
warrington
gave
of
him
it
happened
that
bacon
himself
had
occasion
to
descend
to
hack
room
whilst
warrington
was
talking
there
and
warrington
knowing
weaknesses
acted
upon
them
with
great
adroitness
in
his
behalf
in
the
first
place
he
put
on
his
hat
to
speak
to
bacon
and
addressed
him
from
the
table
on
which
he
seated
himself
bacon
liked
to
be
treated
with
rudeness
by
a
gentleman
and
used
to
pass
it
on
to
his
inferiors
as
boys
pass
the
mark
what
not
know
pendennis
bacon
warrington
said
you
ca
live
much
in
the
world
or
you
would
know
him
a
man
of
property
in
the
west
of
one
of
the
most
ancient
families
in
england
related
to
half
the
nobility
in
the
empire
cousin
to
lord
pontypool
he
was
one
of
the
most
distinguished
men
at
oxbridge
he
dines
at
gaunt
house
every
law
bless
me
you
do
say
so
sir
well
really
law
bless
me
now
said
bacon
i
have
just
been
showing
hack
some
of
his
verses
which
he
sat
up
last
night
at
my
request
to
write
and
hack
talks
about
giving
him
a
copy
of
the
book
the
law
bless
me
now
does
he
the
indeed
spring
annual
is
its
name
as
payment
for
those
verses
you
do
suppose
that
such
a
man
as
arthur
pendennis
gives
up
a
dinner
at
gaunt
house
for
nothing
you
know
as
well
as
anybody
that
the
men
of
fashion
want
to
be
that
they
do
warrington
sir
said
the
publisher
i
tell
you
he
a
star
he
make
a
name
sir
he
a
new
man
they
said
that
of
so
many
of
those
young
swells
warrington
the
publisher
interposed
with
a
sigh
there
was
lord
viscount
dodo
now
i
gave
his
lordship
a
good
bit
of
money
for
his
poems
and
only
sold
eighty
copies
popjoy
hadgincourt
sir
fell
well
then
i
take
my
man
over
to
bungay
warrington
said
and
rose
from
the
table
this
threat
was
too
much
for
bacon
who
was
instantly
ready
to
accede
to
any
reasonable
proposal
of
warrington
and
finally
asked
his
manager
what
those
proposals
were
when
he
heard
that
the
negotiation
only
related
as
yet
to
a
couple
of
ballads
which
warrington
offered
for
the
spring
annual
bacon
said
law
bless
you
give
him
a
check
directly
and
with
this
paper
warrington
went
out
to
his
friend
and
placed
it
grinning
in
hands
pen
was
as
elated
as
if
somebody
had
left
him
a
fortune
he
offered
warrington
a
dinner
at
richmond
instantly
what
should
he
go
and
buy
for
laura
and
his
mother
he
must
buy
something
for
they
like
the
book
better
than
anything
else
said
warrington
with
the
young
one
name
to
the
verses
printed
among
the
thank
god
thank
god
cried
arthur
i
need
be
a
charge
upon
the
old
mother
i
can
pay
off
laura
now
i
can
get
my
own
living
i
can
make
my
own
i
can
marry
the
grand
vizier
daughter
i
can
purchase
a
house
in
belgrave
square
i
can
build
a
fine
castle
in
the
air
said
warrington
pleased
with
the
other
exultation
well
you
may
get
bread
and
cheese
pen
and
i
own
it
tastes
well
the
bread
which
you
earn
they
had
a
magnum
of
claret
at
dinner
at
the
club
that
day
at
charges
it
was
long
since
he
had
indulged
in
such
a
luxury
but
warrington
would
not
baulk
him
and
they
drank
together
to
the
health
of
the
spring
annual
it
never
rains
but
it
pours
according
to
the
proverb
so
very
speedily
another
chance
occurred
by
which
mr
pen
was
to
be
helped
in
his
scheme
of
making
a
livelihood
warrington
one
day
threw
him
a
letter
across
the
table
which
was
brought
by
a
printer
boy
from
captain
shandon
sir
the
little
emissary
said
and
then
went
and
fell
asleep
on
his
accustomed
bench
in
the
passage
he
paid
many
a
subsequent
visit
there
and
brought
many
a
message
to
pen
tuesday
morning
my
dear
sir
bungay
will
be
here
about
the
pall
mall
gazette
you
would
be
the
very
man
to
help
us
with
a
genuine
article
you
understand
dashing
trenchant
and
d
aristocratic
lady
hipshaw
will
write
but
she
not
much
you
know
and
we
two
lords
but
the
less
they
do
the
better
we
must
have
you
we
give
you
your
own
terms
and
we
make
a
hit
with
the
gazette
shall
come
and
see
you
or
can
you
look
in
upon
me
here
ever
yours
c
some
more
opposition
warrington
said
when
pen
had
read
the
note
bungay
and
bacon
are
at
daggers
drawn
each
married
the
sister
of
the
other
and
they
were
for
some
time
the
closest
friends
and
partners
hack
says
it
was
bungay
who
caused
all
the
mischief
between
the
two
whereas
shandon
who
reads
for
bungay
a
good
deal
says
bacon
did
the
business
but
i
do
know
which
is
right
peachum
or
lockit
but
since
they
have
separated
it
is
a
furious
war
between
the
two
publishers
and
no
sooner
does
one
bring
out
a
book
of
travels
or
poems
a
magazine
or
periodical
quarterly
or
monthly
or
weekly
or
annual
but
the
rival
is
in
the
field
with
something
similar
i
have
heard
poor
shandon
tell
with
great
glee
how
he
made
bungay
give
a
grand
dinner
at
blackwall
to
all
his
writers
by
saying
that
bacon
had
invited
his
corps
to
an
entertainment
at
greenwich
when
bungay
engaged
your
celebrated
friend
wagg
to
edit
the
bacon
straightway
rushed
off
and
secured
grindle
to
give
his
name
to
the
magazine
when
bacon
brought
out
his
comic
irish
novel
of
brallaghan
off
went
bungay
to
dublin
and
produced
his
rollicking
hibernian
story
of
mactwolter
when
doctor
hicks
brought
out
his
in
mesopotamia
under
bacon
auspices
bungay
produced
professor
sandiman
in
zahara
and
bungay
is
publishing
his
mall
gazette
as
a
counterpoise
to
bacon
review
let
us
go
and
hear
about
the
there
may
be
a
place
for
you
in
it
pen
my
boy
we
will
go
and
see
shandon
we
are
sure
to
find
him
at
where
does
he
live
asked
pen
in
the
fleet
prison
warrington
said
and
very
much
at
home
he
is
there
too
he
is
the
king
of
the
pen
had
never
seen
this
scene
of
london
life
and
walked
with
no
small
interest
in
at
the
grim
gate
of
that
dismal
edifice
they
went
through
the
anteroom
where
the
officers
and
janitors
of
the
place
were
seated
and
passing
in
at
the
wicket
entered
the
prison
the
noise
and
the
crowd
the
life
and
the
shouting
the
shabby
bustle
of
the
place
struck
and
excited
pen
people
moved
about
ceaselessly
and
restless
like
caged
animals
in
a
menagerie
men
were
playing
at
fives
others
pacing
and
tramping
this
one
in
colloquy
with
his
lawyer
in
dingy
black
that
one
walking
sadly
with
his
wife
by
his
side
and
a
child
on
his
arm
some
were
arrayed
in
tattered
and
had
a
look
of
rakish
fashion
everybody
seemed
to
be
busy
humming
and
on
the
move
pen
felt
as
if
he
choked
in
the
place
and
as
if
the
door
being
locked
upon
him
they
never
would
let
him
out
they
went
through
a
court
up
a
stone
staircase
and
through
passages
full
of
people
and
noise
and
cross
lights
and
black
doors
clapping
and
banging
pen
feeling
as
one
does
in
a
feverish
morning
dream
at
last
the
same
little
runner
who
had
brought
shandon
note
and
had
followed
them
down
fleet
street
munching
apples
and
who
showed
the
way
to
the
two
gentlemen
through
the
prison
said
this
is
the
door
and
shandon
voice
from
within
bade
them
enter
the
room
though
bare
was
not
uncheerful
the
sun
was
shining
in
at
the
window
near
which
sate
a
lady
at
work
who
had
been
gay
and
beautiful
once
but
in
whose
faded
face
kindness
and
tenderness
still
beamed
through
all
his
errors
and
reckless
mishaps
and
misfortunes
this
faithful
creature
adored
her
husband
and
thought
him
the
best
and
cleverest
as
indeed
he
was
one
of
the
kindest
of
men
nothing
ever
seemed
to
disturb
the
sweetness
of
his
temper
not
debts
not
duns
not
misery
not
the
bottle
not
his
wife
unhappy
position
or
his
children
ruined
chances
he
was
perfectly
fond
of
wife
and
children
after
his
fashion
he
always
had
the
kindest
words
and
smiles
for
them
and
ruined
them
with
the
utmost
sweetness
of
temper
he
never
could
refuse
himself
or
any
man
any
enjoyment
which
his
money
could
purchase
he
would
share
his
last
guinea
with
jack
and
tom
and
we
may
be
sure
he
had
a
score
of
such
retainers
he
would
sign
his
name
at
the
back
of
any
man
bill
and
never
pay
any
debt
of
his
own
he
would
write
on
any
side
and
attack
himself
or
another
man
with
equal
indifference
he
was
one
of
the
wittiest
the
most
amiable
and
the
most
incorrigible
of
irishmen
nobody
could
help
liking
charley
shandon
who
saw
him
once
and
those
whom
he
ruined
could
scarcely
be
angry
with
him
when
pen
and
warrington
arrived
the
captain
he
had
been
in
an
irish
militia
regiment
once
and
the
title
remained
with
him
was
sitting
on
his
bed
in
a
torn
with
a
desk
on
his
knees
at
which
he
was
scribbling
as
fast
as
his
rapid
pen
could
write
slip
after
slip
of
paper
fell
off
the
desk
wet
on
to
the
ground
a
picture
of
his
children
was
hung
up
over
his
bed
and
the
youngest
of
them
was
pattering
about
the
room
opposite
the
captain
sate
bungay
a
portly
man
of
stolid
countenance
with
whom
the
little
child
had
been
trying
a
conversation
papa
a
very
clever
man
said
she
mamma
says
oh
very
said
bungay
and
you
a
very
rich
man
bundy
cried
the
child
who
could
hardly
speak
plain
mary
said
mamma
from
her
work
oh
never
mind
bungay
roared
out
with
a
great
laugh
no
harm
in
saying
i
rich
he
he
i
am
pretty
well
off
my
little
if
you
rich
why
do
you
take
papa
out
of
asked
the
child
mamma
at
this
began
to
wipe
her
eyes
with
the
work
on
which
she
was
employed
the
poor
lady
had
hung
curtains
up
in
the
room
had
brought
the
children
picture
and
placed
it
there
and
had
made
one
or
two
attempts
to
ornament
it
mamma
began
to
cry
bungay
turned
red
and
looked
fiercely
out
of
his
bloodshot
little
eyes
shandon
pen
went
on
and
pen
and
warrington
arrived
with
their
knock
captain
shandon
looked
up
from
his
work
how
do
you
do
warrington
he
said
i
speak
to
you
in
a
minute
please
sit
down
gentlemen
if
you
can
find
places
and
away
went
the
pen
again
warrington
pulled
forward
an
old
portmanteau
the
only
available
seat
and
sate
down
on
it
with
a
bow
to
shandon
and
a
nod
to
bungay
the
child
came
and
looked
at
pen
solemnly
and
in
a
couple
of
minutes
the
swift
scribbling
ceased
and
shandon
turning
the
desk
over
on
the
bed
stooped
and
picked
up
the
papers
i
think
this
will
do
said
he
it
the
prospectus
for
the
pall
mall
and
here
the
money
for
it
bungay
said
laying
down
a
note
i
as
good
as
my
word
i
am
when
i
say
i
pay
i
faith
that
more
than
some
of
us
can
say
said
shandon
and
he
eagerly
clapped
the
note
into
his
pocket
chapter
xxxiii
which
is
passed
in
the
neighbourhood
of
ludgate
hill
our
imprisoned
captain
announced
in
smart
and
emphatic
language
in
his
prospectus
that
the
time
had
come
at
last
when
it
was
necessary
for
the
gentlemen
of
england
to
band
together
in
defence
of
their
common
rights
and
their
glorious
order
menaced
on
all
sides
by
foreign
revolutions
by
intestine
radicalism
by
the
artful
calumnies
of
and
and
the
stupid
hostility
of
the
masses
whom
they
gulled
and
led
the
ancient
monarchy
was
insulted
the
captain
said
by
a
ferocious
republican
rabble
the
church
was
deserted
by
envious
dissent
and
undermined
by
stealthy
infidelity
the
good
institutions
which
had
made
our
country
glorious
and
the
name
of
english
gentleman
the
proudest
in
the
world
were
left
without
defence
and
exposed
to
assault
and
contumely
from
men
to
whom
no
sanctuary
was
sacred
for
they
believed
in
nothing
holy
no
history
venerable
for
they
were
too
ignorant
to
have
heard
of
the
past
and
no
law
was
binding
which
they
were
strong
enough
to
break
when
their
leaders
gave
the
signal
for
plunder
it
was
because
the
kings
of
france
mistrusted
their
gentlemen
shandon
remarked
that
the
monarchy
of
saint
louis
went
down
it
was
because
the
people
of
england
still
believed
in
their
gentlemen
that
this
country
encountered
and
overcame
the
greatest
enemy
a
nation
ever
met
it
was
because
we
were
headed
by
gentlemen
that
the
eagles
retreated
before
us
from
the
donro
to
the
garonne
it
was
a
gentleman
who
broke
the
line
at
trafalgar
and
swept
the
plain
of
bungay
nodded
his
head
in
a
knowing
manner
and
winked
his
eyes
when
the
captain
came
to
the
waterloo
passage
and
warrington
burst
out
laughing
you
see
how
our
venerable
friend
bungay
is
affected
shandon
said
slily
looking
up
from
his
papers
that
your
true
sort
of
test
i
have
used
the
duke
of
wellington
and
the
battle
of
waterloo
a
hundred
times
and
i
never
knew
the
duke
to
the
captain
then
went
on
to
confess
with
much
candour
that
up
to
the
present
time
the
gentlemen
of
england
confident
of
their
right
and
careless
of
those
who
questioned
it
had
left
the
political
interest
of
their
order
as
they
did
the
management
of
their
estates
or
the
settlement
of
their
legal
affairs
to
persons
affected
to
each
peculiar
service
and
had
permitted
their
interests
to
be
represented
in
the
press
by
professional
proctors
and
advocates
that
time
shandon
professed
to
consider
was
now
gone
by
the
gentlemen
of
england
must
be
their
own
champions
the
declared
enemies
of
their
order
were
brave
strong
numerous
and
uncompromising
they
must
meet
their
foes
in
the
field
they
must
not
be
belied
and
misrepresented
by
hireling
advocates
they
must
not
have
grub
street
publishing
gazettes
from
whitehall
that
a
dig
at
bacon
people
bungay
said
shandon
turning
round
to
the
publisher
bungay
clapped
his
stick
on
the
floor
hang
him
pitch
into
him
capting
he
said
with
exultation
and
turning
to
warrington
wagged
his
dull
head
more
vehemently
than
ever
and
said
for
a
slashing
article
sir
there
nobody
like
the
capting
like
the
went
on
to
say
that
some
gentlemen
whose
names
were
for
obvious
reasons
not
brought
before
the
public
at
which
warrington
began
to
laugh
again
had
determined
to
bring
forward
a
journal
of
which
the
principles
were
these
men
are
proud
of
their
order
and
anxious
to
uphold
it
cried
out
captain
shandon
flourishing
his
paper
with
a
grin
they
are
loyal
to
their
sovereign
by
faithful
conviction
and
ancestral
allegiance
they
love
their
church
where
they
would
have
their
children
worship
and
for
which
their
forefathers
bled
they
love
their
country
and
would
keep
it
what
the
gentlemen
of
england
yes
the
gentlemen
of
england
we
have
that
in
large
caps
bungay
my
boy
have
made
it
the
greatest
and
freest
in
the
world
and
as
the
names
of
some
of
them
are
appended
to
the
deed
which
secured
our
liberties
at
runnymede
what
that
asked
bungay
an
ancestor
of
mine
sealed
it
with
his
pen
said
with
great
gravity
it
the
habeas
corpus
bungay
warrington
said
on
which
the
publisher
answered
all
right
i
dare
say
and
yawned
though
he
said
go
on
at
runnymede
they
are
ready
to
defend
that
freedom
with
sword
and
pen
and
now
as
then
to
rally
round
the
old
laws
and
liberties
of
bravo
cried
warrington
the
little
child
stood
wondering
the
lady
was
working
silently
and
looking
with
fond
admiration
come
here
little
mary
said
warrington
and
patted
the
child
fair
curls
with
his
large
hand
but
she
shrank
back
from
his
rough
caress
and
preferred
to
go
and
take
refuge
at
pen
knee
and
play
with
his
fine
and
pen
was
very
much
pleased
that
she
came
to
him
for
he
was
very
and
simple
though
he
concealed
his
gentleness
under
a
shy
and
pompous
demeanour
so
she
clambered
up
on
his
lap
whilst
her
father
continued
to
read
his
programme
you
were
laughing
the
captain
said
to
warrington
about
obvious
reasons
which
i
mentioned
now
i
show
ye
what
they
are
ye
unbelieving
heathen
have
said
he
went
on
we
can
not
give
the
names
of
the
parties
engaged
in
this
undertaking
and
that
there
were
obvious
reasons
for
that
concealment
we
number
influential
friends
in
both
houses
of
the
senate
and
have
secured
allies
in
every
diplomatic
circle
in
europe
our
sources
of
intelligence
are
such
as
can
not
by
any
possibility
be
made
public
and
indeed
such
as
no
other
london
or
european
journal
could
by
any
chance
acquire
but
this
we
are
free
to
say
that
the
very
earliest
information
connected
with
the
movement
of
english
and
continental
politics
will
be
found
only
in
the
columns
of
the
pall
mall
gazette
the
statesman
and
the
capitalist
the
country
gentleman
and
the
divine
will
be
amongst
our
readers
because
our
writers
are
amongst
them
we
address
ourselves
to
the
higher
circles
of
society
we
care
not
to
disown
it
the
pall
mall
gazette
is
written
by
gentlemen
for
gentlemen
its
conductors
speak
to
the
classes
in
which
they
live
and
were
born
the
has
his
journal
the
radical
has
his
journal
why
should
the
gentlemen
of
england
be
unrepresented
in
the
press
shandon
then
went
on
with
much
modesty
to
descant
upon
the
literary
and
fashionable
departments
of
the
pall
mall
gazette
which
were
to
be
conducted
by
gentlemen
of
acknowledged
reputation
men
famous
at
the
universities
at
which
mr
pendennis
could
scarcely
help
laughing
and
blushing
known
at
the
clubs
and
of
the
society
which
they
described
he
pointed
out
delicately
to
advertisers
that
there
would
be
no
such
medium
as
the
pall
mall
gazette
for
giving
publicity
to
their
sales
and
he
eloquently
called
upon
the
nobility
of
england
the
baronetage
of
england
the
revered
clergy
of
england
the
bar
of
england
the
matrons
the
daughters
the
homes
and
hearths
of
england
to
rally
round
the
good
old
cause
and
bungay
at
the
conclusion
of
the
reading
woke
up
from
a
second
snooze
in
which
he
had
indulged
himself
and
again
said
it
was
all
right
the
reading
of
the
prospectus
concluded
the
gentlemen
present
entered
into
some
details
regarding
the
political
and
literary
management
of
the
paper
and
bungay
sate
by
listening
and
nodding
his
head
as
if
he
understood
what
was
the
subject
of
their
conversation
and
approved
of
their
opinions
bungay
opinions
in
truth
were
pretty
simple
he
thought
the
captain
could
write
the
best
smashing
article
in
england
he
wanted
the
opposition
house
of
bacon
smashed
and
it
was
his
opinion
that
the
captain
could
do
that
business
if
the
captain
had
written
a
letter
of
junius
on
a
sheet
of
paper
or
copied
a
part
of
the
church
catechism
bungay
would
have
been
perfectly
contented
and
have
considered
that
the
article
was
a
smashing
article
and
he
pocketed
the
papers
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
and
he
not
only
paid
for
the
as
we
have
seen
but
he
called
little
mary
to
him
and
gave
her
a
penny
as
he
went
away
the
reading
of
the
manuscript
over
the
party
engaged
in
general
conversation
shandon
leading
with
a
jaunty
fashionable
air
in
compliment
to
the
two
guests
who
sate
with
him
and
and
who
by
their
appearance
and
manner
he
presumed
to
be
persons
of
the
beau
monde
he
knew
very
little
indeed
of
the
great
world
but
he
had
seen
it
and
made
the
most
of
what
he
had
seen
he
spoke
of
the
characters
of
the
day
and
great
personages
of
the
fashion
with
easy
familiarity
and
jocular
allusions
as
if
it
had
been
his
habit
to
live
amongst
them
he
told
anecdotes
of
their
private
life
and
of
conversations
he
had
had
and
entertainments
at
which
he
had
been
present
and
at
which
such
and
such
a
thing
occurred
pen
was
amused
to
hear
the
shabby
prisoner
in
a
tattered
talking
glibly
about
the
great
of
the
land
shandon
was
always
delighted
when
her
husband
told
these
tales
and
believed
in
them
fondly
every
one
she
did
not
want
to
mingle
in
the
fashionable
world
herself
she
was
not
clever
enough
but
the
great
society
was
the
very
place
for
her
charles
he
shone
in
it
he
was
respected
in
it
indeed
shandon
had
once
been
asked
to
dinner
by
the
earl
of
x
his
wife
treasured
the
in
her
workbox
at
that
very
day
bungay
presently
had
enough
of
this
talk
and
got
up
to
take
leave
whereupon
warrington
and
pen
rose
to
depart
with
the
publisher
though
the
latter
would
have
liked
to
stay
to
make
a
further
acquaintance
with
this
family
who
interested
him
and
touched
him
he
said
something
about
hoping
for
permission
to
repeat
his
visit
upon
which
shandon
with
a
rueful
grin
said
he
was
always
to
be
found
at
home
and
should
be
delighted
to
see
pennington
i
see
you
to
my
gentlemen
said
captain
shandon
seizing
his
hat
in
spite
of
a
deprecatory
look
and
a
faint
cry
of
charles
from
shandon
and
the
captain
in
shabby
slippers
shuffled
out
before
his
guests
leading
the
way
through
the
dismal
passages
of
the
prison
his
hand
was
already
fiddling
with
his
waistcoat
pocket
where
bungay
note
was
as
he
took
leave
of
the
three
gentlemen
at
the
wicket
one
of
them
arthur
pendennis
being
greatly
relieved
when
he
was
out
of
the
horrid
place
and
again
freely
treading
the
flags
of
farringdon
street
shandon
sadly
went
on
with
her
work
at
the
window
looking
into
the
court
she
saw
shandon
with
a
couple
of
men
at
his
heels
run
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
the
prison
tavern
she
had
hoped
to
have
had
him
to
dinner
herself
that
day
there
was
a
piece
of
meat
and
some
salad
in
a
basin
on
the
ledge
outside
of
the
window
of
their
room
which
she
had
expected
that
she
and
little
mary
were
to
share
with
the
child
father
but
there
was
no
chance
of
that
now
he
would
be
in
that
tavern
until
the
hours
for
closing
it
then
he
would
go
and
play
at
cards
or
drink
in
some
other
man
room
and
come
back
silent
with
glazed
eyes
reeling
a
little
on
his
walk
that
his
wife
might
nurse
him
oh
what

shandon
went
to
the
cupboard
and
in

of
a
dinner
made
herself
some
tea
and
in
those
varieties
of
pain
of
which
we
spoke
anon
what
a
part
of
confidante
has
that
poor

ever
since
the
kindly

was
introduced
among
us
what
myriads
of
women
have
cried
over
it
to
be
sure
what
it
has
smoked
by
what
fevered
lips
have
received
refreshment
from
out
of
it
nature

very
gently
by

when
she
made
that

with
a
little

what
a

of

conjure
up

melissa

shandon

sit
down
and

their

together
while
the

goes
out
and
takes
his

she

for
nothing

but
that
when
her
husband
is
away
a
gentleman
with
whom
we
are
already
slightly
acquainted
jack
finucane
a
townsman
of
captain
shandon
found
the
captain
wife
and
little
mary
for
whom
jack
always
brought
a
sweetmeat
in
his
pocket
over
this
meal
jack
thought
shandon
the
greatest
of
created
geniuses
had
had
one
or
two
helps
from
the
prodigal
who
had
always
a
kind
word
and
sometimes
a
guinea
for
any
friend
in
need
and
never
missed
a
day
in
seeing
his
patron
he
was
ready
to
run
shandon
errands
and
transact
his
with
publishers
and
newspaper
editors
duns
creditors
holders
of
shandon
acceptances
gentlemen
disposed
to
speculate
in
those
securities
and
to
transact
the
thousand
little
affairs
of
an
embarrassed
irish
gentleman
i
never
knew
an
embarrassed
irish
gentleman
yet
but
he
had
an
of
his
own
nation
likewise
in
circumstances
of
pecuniary
discomfort
that
has
subordinates
of
his
own
who
again
may
have
other
insolvent
dependents
all
through
his
life
our
captain
marched
at
the
head
of
a
ragged
staff
who
shared
in
the
rough
fortunes
of
their
chieftain
he
wo
have
that
note
very
long
i
bet
a
guinea
bungay
said
of
the
captain
as
he
and
his
two
companions
walked
away
from
the
prison
and
the
publisher
judged
rightly
for
when
shandon
came
to
empty
her
husband
pockets
she
found
but
a
couple
of
shillings
and
a
few
halfpence
out
of
the
morning
remittance
shandon
had
given
a
pound
to
one
follower
had
sent
a
leg
of
mutton
and
potatoes
and
beer
to
an
acquaintance
in
the
poor
side
of
the
prison
had
paid
an
outstanding
bill
at
the
tavern
where
he
had
changed
his
note
had
had
a
dinner
with
two
friends
there
to
whom
he
lost
sundry
at
cards
afterwards
so
that
the
night
left
him
as
poor
as
the
morning
had
found
him
the
publisher
and
the
two
gentlemen
had
had
some
talk
together
after
quitting
shandon
and
warrington
reiterated
to
bungay
what
he
had
said
to
his
rival
bacon
that
pen
was
a
high
fellow
of
great
genius
and
what
was
more
well
with
the
great
world
and
related
to
no
end
of
the
peerage
bungay
replied
that
he
should
be
happy
to
have
dealings
with
pendennis
and
hoped
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
both
gents
to
cut
mutton
with
him
before
long
and
so
with
mutual
politeness
and
protestations
they
parted
it
is
hard
to
see
such
a
man
as
shandon
pen
said
musing
and
talking
that
night
over
the
sight
which
he
had
witnessed
of
accomplishments
so
multifarious
and
of
such
an
undoubted
talent
and
humour
an
inmate
of
a
gaol
for
half
his
time
and
a
bookseller
when
out
of
i
am
a
bookseller
you
are
going
to
try
your
paces
as
a
hack
warrington
said
with
a
laugh
we
are
all
hacks
upon
some
road
or
other
i
would
rather
be
myself
than
paley
our
neighbour
in
chambers
who
has
as
much
enjoyment
of
his
life
as
a
mole
a
deuced
deal
of
undeserved
compassion
has
been
thrown
away
upon
what
you
call
your
bookseller
much
solitary
pipes
and
ale
make
a
cynic
of
you
said
pen
you
are
a
diogenes
by
a
warrington
no
man
shall
tell
me
that
a
man
of
genius
as
shandon
is
ought
to
be
driven
by
such
a
vulgar
as
yonder
bungay
whom
we
have
just
left
who
fattens
on
the
profits
of
the
other
brains
and
enriches
himself
out
of
his
journeyman
labour
it
makes
me
indignant
to
see
a
gentleman
the
serf
of
such
a
creature
as
that
of
a
man
who
ca
speak
the
language
that
he
lives
by
who
is
not
fit
to
black
shandon
so
you
have
begun
already
to
gird
at
the
publishers
and
to
take
your
side
amongst
our
order
bravo
pen
my
be
boy
warrington
answered
laughing
still
what
have
you
got
to
say
against
bungay
relations
with
shandon
was
it
the
publisher
think
you
who
sent
the
author
to
prison
is
it
bungay
who
is
tippling
away
the
note
which
we
saw
just
now
or
shandon
misfortune
drives
a
man
into
bad
company
pen
said
it
is
easy
to
cry
against
a
poor
fellow
who
has
no
society
but
such
as
he
finds
in
a
prison
and
no
resource
except
forgetfulness
and
the
bottle
we
must
deal
kindly
with
the
eccentricities
of
genius
and
remember
that
the
very
ardour
and
enthusiasm
of
temperament
which
makes
the
author
delightful
often
leads
the
man
a
fiddlestick
about
men
of
genius
warrington
cried
out
who
was
a
very
severe
moralist
upon
some
points
though
possibly
a
very
bad
practitioner
i
deny
that
there
are
so
many
geniuses
as
people
who
whimper
about
the
fate
of
men
of
letters
assert
there
are
there
are
thousands
of
clever
fellows
in
the
world
who
could
if
they
would
turn
verses
write
articles
read
books
and
deliver
a
judgment
upon
them
the
talk
of
professional
critics
and
writers
is
not
a
whit
more
brilliant
or
profound
or
amusing
than
that
of
any
other
society
of
educated
people
if
a
lawyer
or
a
soldier
or
a
parson
outruns
his
income
and
does
not
pay
his
bills
he
must
go
to
gaol
and
an
author
must
go
too
if
an
author
fuddles
himself
i
do
know
why
he
should
be
let
off
a
headache
the
next
morning
if
he
orders
a
coat
from
the
tailor
why
he
should
pay
for
i
would
give
him
more
money
to
buy
coats
said
pen
smiling
i
suppose
i
should
like
to
belong
to
a
profession
i
protest
against
that
wretch
of
a
whom
i
see
between
genius
and
his
great
landlord
the
public
and
who
stops
more
than
half
of
the
earnings
and
i
am
a
prose
labourer
warrington
said
you
my
boy
are
a
poet
in
a
small
way
and
so
i
suppose
consider
you
are
authorised
to
be
flighty
what
is
it
you
want
do
you
want
a
body
of
capitalists
that
shall
be
forced
to
purchase
the
works
of
all
authors
who
may
present
themselves
manuscript
in
hand
everybody
who
writes
his
epic
every
driveller
who
can
or
ca
spell
and
produces
his
novel
or
his
tragedy
are
they
all
to
come
and
find
a
bag
of
sovereigns
in
exchange
for
their
worthless
reams
of
paper
who
is
to
settle
what
is
good
or
bad
saleable
or
otherwise
will
you
give
the
buyer
leave
in
fine
to
purchase
or
not
why
sir
when
johnson
sate
behind
the
screen
at
saint
john
gate
and
took
his
dinner
apart
because
he
was
too
shabby
and
poor
to
join
the
literary
bigwigs
who
were
regaling
themselves
round
cave
best
the
tradesman
was
doing
him
no
wrong
you
could
force
the
publisher
to
recognise
the
man
of
genius
in
the
young
man
who
presented
himself
before
him
ragged
gaunt
and
hungry
rags
are
not
a
proof
of
genius
whereas
capital
is
absolute
as
times
go
and
is
perforce
the
it
has
a
right
to
deal
with
the
literary
inventor
as
with
any
other
if
i
produce
a
novelty
in
the
book
trade
i
must
do
the
best
i
can
with
it
but
i
can
no
more
force
murray
to
purchase
my
book
of
travels
or
sermons
than
i
can
compel
tattersall
to
give
me
a
hundred
guineas
for
my
horse
i
may
have
my
own
ideas
of
the
value
of
my
pegasus
and
think
him
the
most
wonderful
of
animals
but
the
dealer
has
a
right
to
his
opinion
too
and
may
want
a
horse
or
a
cob
for
a
heavy
timid
rider
or
a
sound
hack
for
the
road
and
my
beast
wo
suit
you
deal
in
metaphors
warrington
pen
said
but
you
rightly
say
that
you
are
very
prosaic
poor
shandon
there
is
something
about
the
kindness
of
that
man
and
the
gentleness
of
that
sweet
creature
of
a
wife
which
touches
me
profoundly
i
like
him
i
am
afraid
better
than
a
better
and
so
do
i
warrington
said
let
us
give
him
the
benefit
of
our
sympathy
and
the
pity
that
is
due
to
his
weakness
though
i
fear
that
sort
of
kindness
would
be
resented
as
contempt
by
a
more
man
you
see
he
takes
his
consolation
along
with
his
misfortune
and
one
generates
the
other
or
balances
it
as
the
way
of
the
world
he
is
a
prisoner
but
he
is
not
his
genius
sings
within
his
prison
bars
pen
said
yes
warrington
said
bitterly
shandon
accommodates
himself
to
a
cage
pretty
well
he
ought
to
be
wretched
but
he
has
jack
and
tom
to
drink
with
and
that
consoles
him
he
might
have
a
high
place
but
as
he
ca
why
he
can
drink
with
tom
and
jack
he
might
be
providing
for
his
wife
and
children
but
thomas
and
john
have
got
a
bottle
of
brandy
which
they
want
him
to
taste
he
might
pay
poor
snip
the
tailor
the
twenty
pounds
which
the
poor
devil
wants
for
his
landlord
but
john
and
thomas
lay
their
hands
upon
his
purse
and
so
he
drinks
whilst
his
tradesman
goes
to
gaol
and
his
family
to
ruin
let
us
pity
the
misfortunes
of
genius
and
conspire
against
the
publishing
tyrants
who
oppress
men
of
what
are
you
going
to
have
another
glass
of
pen
said
with
a
humorous
look
it
was
at
the
black
kitchen
that
the
above
philosophical
conversation
took
place
between
the
two
young
men
warrington
began
to
laugh
as
usual
video
meliora
proboque
i
mean
bring
it
me
hot
with
sugar
john
he
said
to
waiter
i
would
have
some
more
too
only
i
do
want
it
said
pen
it
does
not
seem
to
me
warrington
that
we
are
much
better
than
our
and
warrington
last
glass
having
been
despatched
the
pair
returned
to
their
chambers
they
found
a
couple
of
notes
in
the
on
their
return
which
had
been
sent
by
their
acquaintance
of
the
morning
bungay
that
hospitable
gentleman
presented
his
compliments
to
each
of
the
gentlemen
and
requested
their
pleasure
of
company
at
dinner
on
an
early
day
to
meet
a
few
literary
friends
we
shall
have
a
grand
spread
warrington
we
shall
meet
all
all
except
poor
shandon
said
pen
nodding
a
to
his
friend
and
he
went
into
his
own
little
room
the
events
and
acquaintances
of
the
day
had
excited
him
a
good
deal
and
he
lay
for
some
time
awake
thinking
over
them
as
warrington
vigorous
and
regular
snore
from
the
neighbouring
apartment
pronounced
that
that
gentleman
was
engaged
in
deep
slumber
is
it
true
thought
pendennis
lying
on
his
bed
and
gazing
at
a
bright
moon
without
that
lighted
up
a
corner
of
his
and
the
frame
of
a
little
sketch
of
fairoaks
drawn
by
laura
and
hung
over
his
drawers
is
it
true
that
i
am
going
to
earn
my
bread
at
last
and
with
my
pen
that
i
shall
impoverish
the
dear
mother
no
longer
and
that
i
may
gain
a
name
and
reputation
in
the
world
perhaps
these
are
welcome
if
they
come
thought
the
young
visionary
laughing
and
blushing
to
himself
though
alone
and
in
the
night
as
he
thought
how
dearly
he
would
relish
honour
and
fame
if
they
could
be
his
if
fortune
favours
me
i
laud
her
if
she
frowns
i
resign
her
i
pray
heaven
i
may
be
honest
if
i
fail
or
if
i
succeed
i
pray
heaven
i
may
tell
the
truth
as
far
as
i
know
it
that
i
may
swerve
from
it
through
flattery
or
interest
or
personal
enmity
or
party
prejudice
dearest
old
mother
what
a
pride
will
you
have
if
i
can
do
anything
worthy
of
our
name
i
and
you
laura
you
wo
scorn
me
as
the
worthless
idler
and
spendthrift
when
you
see
that
i
when
i
have
achieved
a
psha
what
an
alnaschar
i
am
because
i
have
made
five
pounds
by
my
poems
and
am
engaged
to
write
half
a
dozen
articles
for
a
newspaper
he
went
on
with
these
musings
more
happy
and
hopeful
and
in
a
humbler
frame
of
mind
than
he
had
felt
to
be
for
many
a
day
he
thought
over
the
errors
and
idleness
the
passions
extravagances
disappointments
of
his
wayward
youth
he
got
up
from
the
bed
threw
open
the
window
and
looked
out
into
the
night
and
then
by
some
impulse
which
we
hope
was
a
good
one
he
went
up
and
kissed
the
picture
of
fairoaks
and
flinging
himself
down
on
his
knees
by
the
bed
remained
for
some
time
in
that
posture
of
hope
and
submission
when
he
rose
it
was
with
streaming
eyes
he
had
found
himself
repeating
mechanically
some
little
words
which
he
had
been
accustomed
to
repeat
as
a
child
at
his
mother
side
after
the
saying
of
which
she
would
softly
take
him
to
his
bed
and
close
the
curtains
round
him
hushing
him
with
a
benediction
the
next
day
pidgeon
their
attendant
brought
in
a
large
parcel
directed
to

with
compliments
and
a

warrington
to

the

warrington

flung

never

delighted
in
his

his

trembled
as
he
cut
the

he
flung

himself

tea
so
eager
was

to
begin

to

chapter
xxxiv
in
which
the
history
still
hovers
about
fleet
street
captain
shandon
urged
on
by
his
wife
who
seldom
meddled
in
business
matters
had
stipulated
that
john
finucane
esquire
of
the
upper
temple
should
be
appointed
of
forthcoming
pall
mall
gazette
and
this
post
was
accordingly
conferred
upon
finucane
by
the
spirited
proprietor
of
the
journal
indeed
he
deserved
any
kindness
at
the
hands
of
shandon
so
fondly
attached
was
he
as
we
have
said
to
the
captain
and
his
family
and
so
eager
to
do
him
a
service
it
was
in
finucane
chambers
that
shandon
in
former
days
used
to
hide
when
danger
was
near
and
bailiffs
abroad
until
at
length
his
was
known
and
the
sheriff
officers
came
as
regularly
to
wait
for
the
captain
on
finucane
staircase
as
at
his
own
door
it
was
to
chambers
that
poor
shandon
came
often
and
often
to
explain
her
troubles
and
griefs
and
devise
means
of
rescue
for
her
adored
captain
many
a
meal
did
finucane
furnish
for
her
and
the
child
there
it
was
an
honour
to
his
little
rooms
to
be
visited
by
such
a
lady
and
as
she
went
down
the
staircase
with
her
veil
over
her
face
fin
would
lean
over
the
balustrade
looking
after
her
to
see
that
no
temple
lovelace
assailed
her
upon
the
road
perhaps
hoping
that
some
rogue
might
be
induced
to
waylay
her
so
that
he
fin
might
have
the
pleasure
of
rushing
to
her
rescue
and
breaking
the
rascal
bones
it
was
a
sincere
pleasure
to
shandon
when
the
arrangements
were
made
by
which
her
kind
honest
champion
was
appointed
her
husband
in
the
newspaper
he
would
have
sate
with
shandon
as
late
as
the
prison
hours
permitted
and
had
indeed
many
a
time
witnessed
the
putting
to
bed
of
little
mary
who
occupied
a
crib
in
the
room
and
to
whose
evening
prayers
that
god
might
bless
papa
finucane
although
of
the
romish
faith
himself
had
said
amen
with
a
great
deal
of
sympathy
but
he
had
an
appointment
with
bungay
regarding
the
affairs
of
the
paper
which
they
were
to
discuss
over
a
quiet
dinner
so
he
went
away
at
six
from
shandon
but
made
his
accustomed
appearance
at
the
fleet
prison
next
morning
having
arrayed
himself
in
his
best
clothes
and
ornaments
which
though
cheap
as
to
cost
were
very
brilliant
as
to
colour
and
appearance
and
having
in
his
pocket
four
pounds
two
shillings
being
the
amount
of
his
week
salary
at
the
daily
journal
minus
two
shillings
expended
by
him
in
the
purchase
of
a
pair
of
gloves
on
his
way
to
the
prison
he
had
cut
his
mutton
with
bungay
as
the
latter
gentleman
phrased
it
and
trotter
bungay
reader
and
literary
man
of
business
at
dick
on
the
previous
day
and
entered
at
large
into
his
views
respecting
the
conduct
of
the
pall
mall
gazette
in
a
masterly
manner
he
had
pointed
out
what
should
be
the
arrangements
of
the
paper
what
should
be
the
type
for
the
various
articles
who
should
report
the
markets
who
the
turf
and
ring
who
the
church
intelligence
and
who
the
fashionable
he
was
acquainted
with
gentlemen
engaged
in
cultivating
these
various
departments
of
knowledge
and
in
communicating
them
afterwards
to
the
public
in
fine
jack
finucane
was
as
shandon
had
said
of
him
and
as
he
proudly
owned
himself
to
be
one
of
the
best
of
a
paper
in
london
he
knew
the
weekly
earnings
of
every
man
connected
with
the
press
and
was
up
to
a
thousand
dodges
or
ingenious
economic
contrivances
by
which
money
could
be
saved
to
spirited
capitalists
who
were
going
to
set
up
a
paper
he
at
once
dazzled
and
mystified
bungay
who
was
slow
of
comprehension
by
the
rapidity
of
the
calculations
which
he
exhibited
on
paper
as
they
sate
in
the
box
and
bungay
afterwards
owned
to
his
subordinate
trotter
that
that
irishman
seemed
a
clever
fellow
and
now
having
succeeded
in
making
this
impression
upon
bungay
the
faithful
fellow
worked
round
to
the
point
which
he
had
very
near
at
heart
the
liberation
from
prison
of
his
admired
friend
and
chief
captain
shandon
he
knew
to
a
shilling
the
amount
of
the
detainers
which
were
against
the
captain
at
the
porter
lodge
of
the
fleet
and
indeed
professed
to
know
all
his
debts
though
this
was
impossible
for
no
man
in
england
certainly
not
the
captain
himself
was
acquainted
with
them
he
pointed
out
what
shandon
engagements
already
were
and
how
much
better
he
would
work
if
removed
from
confinement
though
this
bungay
denied
for
when
the
captain
locked
up
he
said
we
are
sure
to
find
him
at
home
whereas
when
he
free
you
can
never
catch
hold
of
him
finally
he
so
worked
on
bungay
feelings
by
describing
shandon
pining
away
in
the
prison
and
the
child
sickening
there
that
the
publisher
was
induced
to
promise
that
if
shandon
would
come
to
him
in
the
morning
he
would
see
what
could
be
done
and
the
colloquy
ending
at
this
time
with
the
second
round
of
although
finucane
who
had
four
guineas
in
his
pocket
would
have
discharged
the
tavern
reckoning
with
delight
bungay
said
no
sir
this
is
my
affair
sir
if
you
please
james
take
the
bill
and
eighteenpence
for
yourself
and
he
handed
over
the
necessary
funds
to
the
waiter
thus
it
was
that
finucane
who
went
to
bed
at
the
temple
after
the
dinner
at
dick
found
himself
actually
with
his
salary
intact
upon
saturday
morning
he
gave
shandon
a
wink
so
knowing
and
joyful
that
that
kind
creature
knew
some
good
news
was
in
store
for
her
and
hastened
to
get
her
bonnet
and
shawl
when
fin
asked
if
he
might
have
the
honour
of
taking
her
a
walk
and
giving
her
a
little
fresh
air
and
little
mary
jumped
for
joy
at
the
idea
of
this
holiday
for
finucane
never
neglected
to
give
her
a
toy
or
to
take
her
to
a
show
and
brought
newspaper
orders
in
his
pocket
for
all
sorts
of
london
diversions
to
amuse
the
child
indeed
he
loved
them
with
all
his
heart
and
would
cheerfully
have
dashed
out
his
rambling
brains
to
do
them
or
his
adored
captain
a
service
may
i
go
charley
or
shall
i
stay
with
you
for
you
poorly
dear
this
morning
he
got
a
headache
finucane
he
suffers
from
headaches
and
i
persuaded
him
to
stay
in
bed
shandon
said
go
along
with
you
and
polly
jack
take
care
of
hand
me
over
the
burton
anatomy
and
leave
me
to
my
abominable
devices
shandon
said
with
perfect
he
was
writing
and
not
uncommonly
took
his
greek
and
latin
quotations
of
which
he
knew
the
use
as
a
public
writer
from
that
wonderful
repertory
of
learning
so
fin
gave
his
arm
to
shandon
and
mary
went
skipping
down
the
passages
of
the
prison
and
through
the
gate
into
the
free
air
from
fleet
street
to
paternoster
row
is
not
very
far
as
the
three
reached
bungay
shop
bungay
was
also
entering
at
the
private
door
holding
in
her
hand
a
paper
parcel
and
a
manuscript
volume
bound
in
red
and
indeed
containing
an
account
of
her
transactions
with
the
butcher
in
the
neighbouring
market
bungay
was
in
a
gorgeous
dress
which
flamed
with
red
and
purple
she
wore
a
yellow
shawl
and
had
red
flowers
inside
her
bonnet
and
a
brilliant
light
blue
parasol
shandon
was
in
an
old
black
watered
silk
her
bonnet
had
never
seen
very
brilliant
days
of
prosperity
any
more
than
its
owner
but
she
could
not
help
looking
like
a
lady
whatever
her
attire
was
the
two
women
curtsied
to
each
other
each
according
to
her
fashion
i
hope
you
pretty
well
mum
said
bungay
it
a
very
fine
day
said
shandon
wo
you
step
in
mum
said
bungay
looking
so
hard
at
the
child
as
almost
to
frighten
her
i
i
came
about
business
with
bungay
i
i
hope
he
pretty
well
said
timid
shandon
if
you
go
to
see
him
in
the
could
you
could
you
leave
your
little
gurl
with
me
said
bungay
in
a
deep
voice
and
with
a
tragic
look
as
she
held
out
one
finger
towards
the
child
i
want
to
stay
with
mamma
cried
little
mary
burying
her
face
in
her
mother
dress
go
with
this
lady
mary
my
dear
said
the
mother
i
show
you
some
pretty
pictures
said
bungay
with
the
voice
of
an
ogress
and
some
nice
things
besides
look
here
and
opening
her
parcel
bungay
displayed
some
choice
sweet
buscuits
such
as
her
bungay
loved
after
his
wine
little
mary
followed
after
this
attraction
the
whole
party
entering
at
the
private
entrance
from
which
a
side
door
led
into
bungay
commercial
apartments
here
however
as
the
child
was
about
to
part
from
her
mother
her
courage
again
failed
her
and
again
she
ran
to
the
maternal
petticoat
upon
which
the
kind
and
gentle
shandon
seeing
the
look
of
disappointment
in
bungay
face
said
if
you
will
let
me
i
will
come
up
too
and
sit
for
a
few
minutes
and
so
the
three
females
ascended
the
stairs
together
a
second
biscuit
charmed
little
mary
into
perfect
confidence
and
in
a
minute
or
two
she
prattled
away
without
the
least
restraint
faithful
finucane
meanwhile
found
bungay
in
a
severer
mood
than
he
had
been
on
the
night
previous
when
of
a
bottle
of
port
and
two
large
glasses
of
had
warmed
his
soul
into
enthusiasm
and
made
him
generous
in
his
promises
towards
captain
shandon
his
impetuous
wife
had
rebuked
him
on
his
return
home
she
had
ordered
that
he
should
give
no
relief
to
the
captain
he
was
a
fellow
whom
no
money
would
help
she
disapproved
of
the
plan
of
the
pall
mall
gazette
and
expected
that
bungay
would
only
lose
his
money
in
it
as
they
were
losing
over
the
way
she
always
called
her
brother
establishment
over
the
way
by
the
whitehall
journal
let
shandon
stop
in
prison
and
do
his
work
it
was
the
best
place
for
him
in
vain
finucane
pleaded
and
promised
and
implored
for
his
friend
bungay
had
had
an
hour
lecture
in
the
morning
and
was
inexorable
but
what
honest
jack
failed
to
do
in
the
the
pretty
faces
and
manners
of
the
mother
and
child
were
effecting
in
the
where
they
were
melting
the
fierce
but
really
soft
bungay
there
was
an
artless
sweetness
in
shandon
voice
and
a
winning
frankness
of
manner
which
made
most
people
fond
of
her
and
pity
her
and
taking
courage
by
the
rugged
kindness
with
which
her
hostess
received
her
the
captain
lady
told
her
story
and
described
her
husband
goodness
and
virtues
and
her
child
failing
health
she
was
obliged
to
part
with
two
of
them
she
said
and
send
them
to
school
for
she
could
not
have
them
in
that
horrid
place
that
bungay
though
as
grim
as
lady
macbeth
melted
under
the
influence
of
the
simple
tale
and
said
she
would
go
down
and
speak
to
bungay
now
in
this
household
to
speak
was
to
command
with
bungay
and
with
bungay
to
hear
was
to
obey
it
was
just
when
poor
finucane
was
in
despair
about
his
negotiation
that
the
majestic
bungay
descended
upon
her
spouse
politely
requested
finucane
to
step
up
to
his
friends
in
her
while
she
held
a
few
minutes
conversation
with
and
when
the
pair
were
alone
the
publisher
better
half
informed
him
of
her
intentions
towards
the
captain
lady
what
in
the
wind
now
my
dear
maecenas
asked
surprised
at
his
wife
altered
tone
you
would
hear
of
my
doing
anything
for
the
captain
this
morning
i
wonder
what
has
been
a
changing
of
you
the
capting
is
an
irishman
bungay
replied
and
those
irish
i
have
always
said
i
could
abide
but
his
wife
is
a
lady
as
any
one
can
see
and
a
good
woman
and
a
clergyman
daughter
and
a
west
of
england
woman
which
i
am
myself
by
my
mother
side
and
o
marmaduke
did
you
remark
the
little
gurl
yes
i
saw
the
little
and
did
you
see
how
like
she
was
to
our
angel
bessy
mr
and
bungay
thoughts
flew
back
to
a
period
eighteen
years
back
when
bacon
and
bungay
had
just
set
up
in
business
as
small
booksellers
in
a
country
town
and
when
she
had
had
a
child
named
bessy
something
like
the
little
mary
who
had
moved
her
compassion
well
well
my
dear
bungay
said
seeing
the
little
eyes
of
his
wife
begin
to
twinkle
and
grow
red
the
captain
ai
in
for
much
there
only
a
hundred
and
thirty
pound
against
him
half
the
money
will
take
him
out
of
the
fleet
finucane
says
and
we
pay
him
half
salaries
till
he
has
made
the
account
square
when
the
little
said
do
you
take
par
out
of
prizn
i
did
feel
it
flora
upon
my
honour
i
did
and
the
upshot
of
this
conversation
was
that
and
bungay
both
ascended
to
the
and
bungay
made
a
heavy
and
clumsy
speech
in
which
he
announced
to
shandon
that
hearing
pounds
would
set
her
husband
free
he
was
ready
to
advance
that
sum
of
money
deducting
it
from
the
captain
salary
and
that
he
would
give
it
to
her
on
condition
that
she
would
personally
settle
with
the
creditors
regarding
her
husband
liberation
i
think
this
was
the
happiest
day
that
shandon
and
finucane
had
had
for
a
long
time
bedad
bungay
you
a
trump
roared
out
fin
in
an
overpowering
brogue
and
emotion
give
us
your
fist
old
boy
and
wo
we
send
the
pall
mall
gazette
up
to
ten
thousand
a
week
all
and
he
jumped
about
the
room
and
tossed
up
little
mary
with
a
hundred
frantic
antics
if
i
could
drive
you
anywhere
in
my
carriage
shandon
sure
it
quite
at
your
service
bungay
said
looking
out
at
a
vehicle
which
had
just
driven
up
and
in
which
this
lady
took
the
air
considerably
and
the
two
ladies
with
little
mary
between
them
whose
tiny
hand
maecenas
wife
kept
fixed
in
her
great
grasp
with
the
delighted
finucane
on
the
back
seat
drove
away
from
paternoster
row
as
the
owner
of
the
vehicle
threw
triumphant
glances
at
the
opposite
windows
at
bacon
it
wo
do
the
captain
any
good
thought
bungay
going
back
to
his
desk
and
accounts
but
becomes
reglar
upset
when
she
thinks
about
her
misfortune
the
child
would
have
been
of
age
yesterday
if
she
lived
flora
told
me
so
and
he
wondered
how
women
did
remember
things
we
are
happy
to
say
that
shandon
sped
with
very
good
success
upon
her
errand
she
who
had
had
to
mollify
creditors
when
she
had
no
money
at
all
and
only
tears
and
entreaties
wherewith
to
soothe
them
found
no
difficulty
in
making
them
relent
by
means
of
a
bribe
of
ten
shillings
in
the
pound
and
the
next
sunday
was
the
last
for
some
time
at
least
which
the
captain
spent
in
prison
chapter
xxxv
dinner
in
the
row
upon
the
appointed
day
our
two
friends
made
their
appearance
at
bungay
door
in
paternoster
row
not
the
public
entrance
through
which
booksellers
boys
issued
with
their
sacks
full
of
bungay
volumes
and
around
which
timid
aspirants
lingered
with
their
virgin
manuscripts
ready
for
sale
to
sultan
bungay
but
at
the
private
door
of
the
house
whence
the
splendid
bungay
would
come
forth
to
step
into
her
chaise
and
take
her
drive
settling
herself
on
the
cushions
and
casting
looks
of
defiance
at
bacon
opposite
windows
at
bacon
who
was
as
yet
a
chaiseless
woman
on
such
occasions
when
very
much
wroth
at
her
splendour
bacon
would
fling
up
the
sash
of
her
window
and
look
out
with
her
four
children
at
the
chaise
as
much
as
to
say
look
at
these
four
darlings
flora
bungay
this
is
why
i
ca
drive
in
my
carriage
you
would
give
a
to
have
the
same
and
it
was
with
these
arrows
out
of
her
quiver
that
emma
bacon
shot
flora
bungay
as
she
sate
in
her
chariot
envious
and
childless
as
pen
and
warrington
came
to
bungay
door
a
carriage
and
a
cab
drove
up
to
bacon
old
slocum
descended
heavily
from
the
first
the
doctor
equipage
was
as
ponderous
as
his
style
but
both
had
a
fine
sonorous
effect
upon
the
publishers
in
the
row
a
couple
of
dazzling
white
waistcoats
stepped
out
of
the
cab
warrington
laughed
you
see
bacon
has
his
too
that
is
slocum
author
of
of
the
poisoners
you
would
hardly
have
recognised
our
friend
hoolan
in
that
gallant
white
waistcoat
doolan
is
one
of
bungay
men
and
faith
here
he
indeed
hoolan
and
doolan
had
come
from
the
strand
in
the
same
cab
tossing
up
by
the
way
which
should
pay
the
shilling
and
stepped
from
the
other
side
of
the
way
arrayed
in
black
with
a
large
pair
of
white
gloves
which
were
spread
out
on
his
hands
and
which
the
owner
could
not
help
regarding
with
pleasure
the
house
porter
in
an
evening
coat
and
gentlemen
with
gloves
as
large
as
doolan
but
of
the
famous
berlin
web
were
on
the
passage
of
bungay
house
to
receive
the
guests
hats
and
coats
and
bawl
their
names
up
the
stair
some
of
the
latter
had
arrived
when
the
three
new
visitors
made
their
appearance
but
there
was
only
bungay
in
red
satin
and
a
turban
to
represent
her
own
charming
sex
she
made
curtsies
to
each
as
he
entered
the
but
her
mind
was
evidently
by
extraneous
thoughts
the
fact
is
was
disturbing
her
and
as
soon
as
she
had
received
each
individual
of
her
own
company
flora
bungay
flew
back
to
the
embrasure
of
the
window
whence
she
could
rake
the
carriages
of
emma
friends
as
they
came
rattling
up
the
row
the
sight
of
large
carriage
with
the
gaunt
crushed
flora
none
but
hack
cabs
had
driven
up
to
her
own
door
on
that
day
they
were
all
literary
gentlemen
though
unknown
as
yet
to
pen
there
was
bole
the
real
editor
of
the
magazine
of
which
wagg
was
the
nominal
chief
trotter
who
from
having
broken
out
on
the
world
as
a
poet
of
a
tragic
and
suicidial
cast
had
now
subsided
into
one
of
bungay
back
shops
as
reader
for
that
gentleman
and
captain
sumph
an
reader
about
town
and
related
in
some
indistinct
manner
to
literature
and
the
peerage
he
was
said
to
have
written
a
book
once
to
have
been
a
friend
of
lord
byron
to
be
related
to
lord
sumphington
in
fact
anecdotes
of
byron
formed
his
staple
and
he
seldom
spoke
but
with
the
name
of
that
poet
or
some
of
his
contemporaries
in
his
mouth
as
thus
i
remember
poor
shelley
at
school
being
sent
up
for
good
for
a
copy
of
verses
every
line
of
which
i
wrote
by
jove
or
i
recollect
when
i
was
at
missolonghi
with
byron
offering
to
bet
gamba
and
so
forth
this
gentleman
pen
remarked
was
listened
to
with
great
attention
by
bungay
his
anecdotes
of
the
aristocracy
of
which
he
was
a
member
delighted
the
publisher
lady
and
he
was
almost
a
greater
man
than
the
great
wagg
himself
in
her
eyes
had
he
but
come
in
his
own
carriage
bungay
would
have
made
her
bungay
purchase
any
given
volume
from
his
pen
bungay
went
about
to
his
guests
as
they
arrived
and
did
the
honours
of
his
house
with
much
cordiality
how
are
you
sir
fine
day
sir
glad
to
see
you
year
sir

love
let
me
ave
the
honour
of

faith
a
man
must
be
hard
to
please
bungay
who
ca
eat
a
good
dinner
in
this
house
doolan
said
and
he
winked
and
stroked
his
lean
chops
with
his
large
gloves
and
made
appeals
of
friendship
to
bungay
which
that
honest
woman
refused
with
scorn
from
the
timid
man
she
could
abide
that
doolan
she
said
in
confidence
to
her
friends
indeed
all
his
flatteries
failed
to
win
her
as
they
talked
bungay
surveying
mankind
from
her
window
a
magnificent
vision
of
an
enormous
grey
appeared
and
neared
rapidly
a
pair
of
white
reins
held
by
small
white
gloves
were
visible
behind
it
a
face
pale
but
richly
decorated
with
a
the
head
of
an
exiguous
groom
bobbing
over
the
these
bright
things
were
revealed
to
the
delighted
bungay
the
honourable
percy
quite
punctual
i
declare
she
said
and
sailed
to
the
door
to
be
in
waiting
at
the
nobleman
arrival
it
percy
popjoy
said
pen
looking
out
of
window
and
seeing
an
individual
in
extremely
lacquered
boots
descend
from
the
swinging
cab
and
in
fact
it
was
that
young
nobleman
lord
falconet
eldest
son
as
we
all
very
well
know
who
was
come
to
dine
with
the
publisher
his
publisher
of
the
row
he
was
my
fag
at
eton
warrington
said
i
ought
to
have
licked
him
a
little
he
and
pen
had
had
some
bouts
at
the
oxbridge
union
debates
in
which
pen
had
had
very
much
the
better
of
percy
who
presently
appeared
with
his
hat
under
his
arm
and
a
look
of
indescribable
and
fatuity
in
his
round
dimpled
face
upon
which
nature
had
burst
out
with
a
but
exhausted
with
the
effort
had
left
the
rest
of
the
countenance
bare
of
hair
the
temporary
groom
of
the
chambers
bawled
out
the
honourable
percy
popjoy
much
to
that
gentleman
discomposure
at
hearing
his
titles
announced
what
did
the
man
want
to
take
away
my
hat
for
bungay
he
asked
of
the
publisher
ca
do
without
my
hat
want
it
to
make
my
bow
to
bungay
how
well
you
look
bungay
have
seen
your
carriage
in
the
park
why
have
you
been
there
i
missed
you
indeed
i
i
afraid
you
a
sad
quiz
said
bungay
quiz
never
made
a
joke
in
my
hullo
who
here
how
d
do
pendennis
how
d
do
warrington
these
are
old
friends
of
mine
bungay
i
say
how
the
doose
did
you
come
here
he
asked
of
the
two
young
men
turnip
his
lacquered
heels
upon
bungay
who
respected
her
husband
two
young
guests
now
that
she
found
they
were
intimate
with
a
lord
son
what
do
they
know
him
she
asked
rapidly
of
b
high
fellers
i
tell
you
the
young
one
related
to
all
the
nobility
said
the
publisher
and
both
ran
forward
smiling
and
bowing
to
greet
almost
as
great
personages
as
the
young
lord
no
less
characters
indeed
than
the
great
wenham
and
the
great
wagg
who
were
now
announced
wenham
entered
wearing
the
usual
demure
look
and
stealthy
smile
with
which
he
commonly
surveyed
the
tips
of
his
neat
little
shining
boots
and
which
he
but
seldom
brought
to
bear
upon
the
person
who
addressed
him
wagg
white
waistcoat
spread
out
on
the
contrary
with
profuse
brilliancy
his
burly
red
face
shone
resplendent
over
it
lighted
up
with
the
thoughts
of
good
jokes
and
a
good
dinner
he
liked
to
make
his
entree
into
a
with
a
laugh
and
when
he
went
away
at
night
to
leave
a
joke
exploding
behind
him
no
personal
calamities
or
distresses
of
which
that
humourist
had
his
share
in
common
with
the
unjocular
part
of
mankind
could
altogether
keep
his
humour
down
whatever
his
griefs
might
be
the
thought
of
a
dinner
rallied
his
great
soul
and
when
he
saw
a
lord
he
saluted
him
with
a
pun
wenham
went
up
then
with
a
smug
smile
and
whisper
to
bungay
and
looked
at
her
from
under
his
eyes
and
showed
her
the
tips
of
his
shoes
wagg
said
she
looked
charming
and
pushed
on
straight
at
the
young
nobleman
whom
he
called
pop
and
to
whom
he
instantly
related
a
funny
story
seasoned
with
what
the
french
call
gros
sel
he
was
delighted
to
see
pen
too
and
shook
hands
with
him
and
slapped
him
on
the
back
cordially
for
he
was
full
of
spirits
and
and
he
talked
in
a
loud
voice
about
their
last
place
and
occasion
of
meeting
at
baymouth
and
asked
how
their
friends
of
clavering
park
were
and
whether
sir
francis
was
not
coming
to
london
for
the
season
and
whether
pen
had
been
to
see
lady
rockminster
who
had
arrived
fine
old
lady
lady
rockminster
these
remarks
wagg
made
not
for
pen
ear
so
much
as
for
the
edification
of
the
company
whom
he
was
glad
to
inform
that
he
paid
visits
to
gentlemen
country
seats
and
was
on
intimate
terms
with
the
nobility
wenham
also
shook
hands
with
our
young
friend
all
of
which
scenes
bungay
remarked
with
respectful
pleasure
and
communicated
her
ideas
to
bungay
afterwards
regarding
the
importance
of
pendennis
ideas
by
which
pen
profited
much
more
than
he
was
aware
pen
who
had
read
and
rather
admired
some
of
her
works
and
expected
to
find
in
miss
bunion
a
person
somewhat
resembling
her
own
description
of
herself
in
the
in
which
she
stated
that
her
youth
resembled
a
violet
shrinking
meanly
when
blows
the
march
wind
keenly
a
timid
fawn
on
lawn
where
rustle
greenly
and
that
her
maturer
beauty
was
something
very
different
certainly
to
the
artless
loveliness
of
her
prime
but
still
exceedingly
captivating
and
striking
beheld
rather
to
his
surprise
and
amusement
a
large
and
bony
woman
in
a
crumpled
satin
dress
who
came
creaking
into
the
room
with
a
step
as
heavy
as
a
grenadier
wagg
instantly
noted
the
straw
which
she
brought
in
at
the
rumpled
skirt
of
her
dress
and
would
have
stooped
to
pick
it
up
but
miss
bunion
disarmed
all
criticism
by
observing
this
ornament
herself
and
putting
her
own
large
foot
upon
it
so
as
to
separate
it
from
her
robe
she
stooped
and
picked
up
the
straw
saying
to
bungay
that
she
was
very
sorry
to
be
a
little
late
but
that
the
omnibus
was
very
slow
and
what
a
comfort
it
was
to
get
a
ride
all
the
way
from
brompton
for
sixpence
nobody
laughed
at
the
poetess
speech
it
was
uttered
so
simply
indeed
the
worthy
woman
had
not
the
least
notion
of
being
ashamed
of
an
action
incidental
upon
her
poverty
is
that
pen
said
to
wenham
by
whom
he
was
standing
why
her
picture
in
the
volume
represents
her
as
a
very
young
you
know
like
all
others
will
run
to
seed
wenham
said
miss
bunion
portrait
was
probably
painted
some
years
well
i
like
her
for
not
being
ashamed
of
her
so
do
i
said
wenham
who
would
have
starved
rather
than
have
come
to
dinner
in
an
omnibus
but
i
do
think
that
she
need
flourish
the
straw
about
do
you
pendennis
my
dear
miss
bunion
how
do
you
do
i
was
in
a
great
lady
this
morning
and
everybody
was
charmed
with
your
new
volume
those
lines
on
the
christening
of
lady
fanny
fantail
brought
tears
into
the
duchess
eyes
i
said
that
i
thought
i
should
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
and
she
begged
me
to
thank
you
and
say
how
greatly
she
was
this
history
told
in
a
bland
smiling
manner
of
a
duchess
whom
wenham
had
met
that
very
morning
too
quite
put
poor
wagg
dowager
and
baronet
out
of
court
and
placed
wenham
beyond
wagg
as
a
man
of
fashion
wenham
kept
this
inestimable
advantage
and
having
the
conversation
to
himself
ran
on
with
a
number
of
anecdotes
regarding
the
aristocracy
he
tried
to
bring
popjoy
into
the
conversation
by
making
appeals
to
him
and
saying
i
was
telling
your
father
this
morning
or
i
think
you
were
present
at
house
the
other
night
when
the
duke
said
but
popjoy
would
not
gratify
him
by
joining
in
the
talk
preferring
to
fall
back
into
the
window
recess
with
bungay
and
watch
the
cabs
that
drove
up
to
the
opposite
door
at
least
if
he
would
not
talk
the
hostess
hoped
that
those
odious
bacons
would
see
how
she
had
secured
the
noble
percy
popjoy
for
her
party
and
now
the
bell
of
saint
paul
tolled
half
an
hour
later
than
that
for
which
bungay
had
invited
his
party
and
it
was
complete
with
the
exception
of
two
guests
who
at
last
made
their
appearance
and
in
whom
pen
was
pleased
to
recognise
captain
and
shandon
when
these
two
had
made
their
greetings
to
the
master
and
mistress
of
the
house
and
exchanged
nods
of
more
or
less
recognition
with
most
of
the
people
present
pen
and
warrington
went
up
and
shook
hands
very
warmly
with
shandon
who
perhaps
was
affected
to
meet
them
and
think
where
it
was
she
had
seen
them
but
a
few
days
before
shandon
was
brushed
up
and
looked
pretty
smart
in
a
red
velvet
waistcoat
and
a
frill
into
which
his
wife
had
stuck
her
best
brooch
in
spite
of
bungay
kindness
perhaps
in
consequence
of
it
shandon
felt
great
terror
and
timidity
in
approaching
her
indeed
she
was
more
awful
than
ever
in
her
red
satin
and
bird
of
paradise
and
it
was
not
until
she
had
asked
in
her
great
voice
about
the
dear
little
gurl
that
the
latter
was
somewhat
encouraged
and
ventured
to
speak
woman
popjoy
whispered
to
warrington
do
introduce
me
to
captain
shandon
warrington
i
told
he
a
tremendous
clever
fellow
and
dammy
i
adore
intellect
by
jove
i
do
this
was
the
truth
heaven
had
not
endowed
young
popjoy
with
much
intellect
of
his
own
but
had
given
him
a
generous
faculty
for
admiring
if
not
for
appreciating
the
intellect
of
others
and
introduce
me
to
miss
bunion
i
told
she
very
clever
too
she
rum
to
look
at
certainly
but
that
do
matter
dammy
i
consider
myself
a
literary
man
and
i
wish
to
know
all
the
clever
so
popjoy
and
shandon
had
the
pleasure
of
becoming
acquainted
with
one
another
and
now
the
doors
of
the
adjoining
being
flung
open
the
party
entered
and
took
their
seats
at
table
pen
found
himself
next
to
bunion
on
one
side
and
to
wagg
the
truth
is
wagg
fled
alarmed
from
the
vacant
place
by
the
poetess
and
pen
was
compelled
to
take
it
the
gifted
being
did
not
talk
much
during
dinner
but
pen
remarked
that
she
ate
with
a
vast
appetite
and
never
refused
any
of
the
supplies
of
wine
which
were
offered
to
her
by
the
butler
indeed
miss
bunion
having
considered
pendennis
for
a
minute
who
gave
himself
rather
grand
airs
and
who
was
attired
in
an
extremely
fashionable
style
with
his
very
best
chains
shirt
studs
and
cambric
fronts
he
was
set
down
and
not
without
reason
as
a
prig
by
the
poetess
who
thought
it
was
much
better
to
attend
to
her
dinner
than
to
take
any
notice
of
him
she
told
him
as
much
in
after
days
with
her
usual
candour
i
took
you
for
one
of
the
little
mayfair
dandies
she
said
to
pen
you
looked
as
solemn
as
a
little
undertaker
and
as
i
disliked
beyond
measure
the
odious
creature
who
was
on
the
other
side
of
me
i
thought
it
was
best
to
eat
my
dinner
and
hold
my
and
you
did
both
very
well
my
dear
miss
bunion
pen
said
with
a
laugh
well
so
i
do
but
i
intend
to
talk
to
you
the
next
time
a
great
deal
for
you
are
neither
so
solemn
nor
so
stupid
nor
so
pert
as
you
ah
miss
bunion
how
i
pine
for
that
time
to
come
pen
said
with
an
air
of
comical
gallantry
but
we
must
return
to
the
day
and
the
dinner
at
paternoster
row
the
repast
was
of
the
richest
description
what
i
call
of
the
florid
gothic
style
wagg
whispered
to
penn
who
sate
beside
the
humourist
in
his
voice
the
men
in
creaking
shoes
and
berlin
gloves
were
numerous
and
solemn
carrying
on
rapid
conversations
behind
the
guests
as
they
moved
to
and
fro
with
the
dishes
doolan
called
out
waither
to
one
of
them
and
blushed
when
he
thought
of
his
blunder
bungay
footboy
was
lost
amidst
those
large
and
attendants
look
at
that
very
man
wagg
said
he
an
undertaker
in
amen
corner
and
attends
funerals
and
dinners
cold
meat
and
hot
you
perceive
he
the
sham
butler
here
and
i
observe
my
dear
pendennis
as
you
will
through
life
that
wherever
there
is
a
sham
butler
at
a
london
dinner
there

where
he

in
the
habit
of
dining
i
remember
at
poor
rawdon
crawley
sir
pitt
crawley
brother
he
was
governor
of
coventry
island
steyne
chef
always
came
in
the
morning
and
the
butler
arrived
with
the
champagne
from

in
the
how
good

is
said
popjoy

must
have
a
cordon
bleu
in
your

he
spoke
of
a
very
likely
i
mean

french

the
polite
guest
o

your
artist

a
frenchman
mrs
called

wagg
well
i
sure
i

answered
the
publisher
lady
because
if
he
does
he
a
quizzin
yer
cried
wagg
but
nobody
saw
the
pun
which
disconcerted
somewhat
the
bashful
punster
the
dinner
is
from
griggs
in
paul
churchyard
so
is
bacon
he
whispered
pen
bungay
writes
to
give
a
head
more
than
bacon
so
does
bacon
they
would
poison
each
other
ices
if
they
could
get
near
them
and
as
for
the
they
are
poison
this
hum
ha
this
brimborion
a
la
sevigne
is
delicious
he
said
helping
himself
to
a
dish
which
the
undertaker
handed
to
him
well
i
glad
you
like
it
bungay
answered
blushing
and
not
knowing
whether
the
name
of
the
dish
was
actually
that
which
wagg
gave
to
it
but
dimly
conscious
that
that
individual
was
quizzing
her
accordingly
she
hated
wagg
with
female
ardour
and
would
have
deposed
him
from
his
command
over
bungay
periodical
but
that
his
name
was
great
in
the
trade
and
his
reputation
in
the
land
considerable
by
the
displacement
of
persons
warrington
had
found
himself
on
the
right
hand
of
shandon
who
sate
in
plain
black
silk
and
faded
ornaments
by
the
side
of
the
florid
publisher
the
sad
smile
of
the
lady
moved
his
rough
heart
to
pity
nobody
seemed
to
interest
himself
about
her
she
sate
looking
at
her
husband
who
himself
seemed
rather
abashed
in
the
presence
of
some
of
the
company
wenham
and
wagg
both
knew
him
and
his
circumstances
he
had
worked
with
the
latter
and
was
immeasurably
his
superior
in
wit
genius
and
acquirement
but
star
was
brilliant
in
the
world
and
poor
shandon
was
unknown
there
he
could
not
speak
before
the
noisy
talk
of
the
coarser
and
more
successful
man
but
drank
his
wine
in
silence
and
as
much
of
it
as
the
people
would
give
him
he
was
under
surveillance
bungay
had
warned
the
undertaker
not
to
fill
the
captain
glass
too
often
or
too
full
it
was
a
melancholy
precaution
that
and
the
more
melancholy
that
it
was
necessary
shandon
too
cast
alarmed
glances
across
the
table
to
see
that
her
husband
did
not
exceed
abashed
by
the
failure
of
his
first
pun
for
he
was
impudent
and
easily
disconcerted
wagg
kept
his
conversation
pretty
much
to
pen
during
the
rest
of
dinner
and
of
course
chiefly
spoke
about
their
neighbours
this
is
one
of
bungay
grand
he
said
we
are
all
bungavians
did
you
read
popjoy
novel
it
was
an
old
magazine
story
written
by
poor
buzzard
years
ago
and
forgotten
here
until
trotter
that
is
trotter
with
the
large
shirt
collar
fished
it
out
and
bethought
him
that
it
was
applicable
to
the
late
elopement
so
bob
wrote
a
few
chapters
a
propos
popjoy
permitted
the
use
of
his
name
and
i
dare
say
supplied
a
page
here
and
there
and
or
the
fugitive
duchess
made
its
appearance
the
great
fun
is
to
examine
popjoy
about
his
own
work
of
which
he
does
know
a
i
say
popjoy
what
a
capital
passage
that
is
in
volume
three
where
the
cardinal
in
disguise
after
being
converted
by
the
bishop
of
london
proposes
marriage
to
the
duchess
glad
you
like
it
popjoy
answered
it
a
favourite
bit
of
my
there
no
such
thing
in
the
whole
book
whispered
wagg
to
pen
invented
it
myself
gad
it
would
be
a
bad
plot
for
a
i
remember
poor
byron
hobhouse
trelawney
and
myself
dining
with
cardinal
mezzocaldo
at
rome
captain
sumph
began
and
we
had
some
orvieto
wine
for
dinner
which
byron
liked
very
much
and
i
remember
how
the
cardinal
regretted
that
he
was
a
single
man
we
went
to
civita
vecchia
two
days
afterwards
where
byron
yacht
was
and
by
jove
the
cardinal
died
within
three
weeks
and
byron
was
very
sorry
for
he
rather
liked
a
devilish
interesting
story
sumph
indeed
wagg
said
you
should
publish
some
of
those
stories
captain
sumph
you
really
should
such
a
volume
would
make
our
friend
bungay
fortune
shandon
said
why
do
you
ask
sumph
to
publish
in
your
new
paper
the
d
hay
shandon
bawled
out
wagg
why
do
you
ask
him
to
publish
in
your
old
magazine
the
thingumbob
shandon
replied
is
there
going
to
be
a
new
paper
asked
wenham
who
knew
perfectly
well
but
was
ashamed
of
his
connection
with
the
press
bungay
going
to
bring
out
a
paper
cried
popjoy
who
on
the
contrary
was
proud
of
his
literary
reputation
and
acquaintances
you
must
employ
me
bungay
use
your
influence
with
him
and
make
him
employ
me
prose
or
verse
what
shall
it
be
novels
poems
travels
or
leading
articles
begad
anything
or
everything
only
let
bungay
pay
me
and
ready
i
am
now
my
dear
bungay
begad
it
to
be
called
the
small
beer
chronicle
growled
wagg
and
little
popjoy
is
to
be
engaged
for
the
infantine
it
is
to
be
called
the
pall
mall
gazette
sir
and
we
shall
be
very
happy
to
have
you
with
us
shandon
said
pall
mall
gazette
why
pall
mall
gazette
asked
wagg
because
the
editor
was
born
at
dublin
the
at
cork
because
the
proprietor
lives
in
paternoster
row
and
the
paper
is
published
in
catherine
street
strand
wo
that
reason
suffice
you
wagg
shandon
said
he
was
getting
rather
angry
everything
must
have
a
name
my
dog
ponto
has
got
a
namee
you
got
a
name
and
a
name
which
you
deserve
more
or
less
indeed
why
d
grudge
the
name
to
our
paper
by
any
other
name
it
would
smell
as
sweet
said
wagg
i
have
ye
remember
its
name
not
d
wagg
said
shandon
you
know
its
name
well
enough
and
and
you
know
and
i
know
your
address
too
said
wagg
but
this
was
spoken
in
an
undertone
and
the
irishman
was
appeased
almost
in
an
instant
after
his
ebullition
of
spleen
and
asked
wagg
to
drink
wine
with
him
in
a
friendly
voice
when
the
ladies
retired
from
the
table
the
talk
grew
louder
still
and
presently
wenham
in
a
courtly
speech
proposed
that
everybody
should
drink
to
the
health
of
the
new
journal
eulogising
highly
the
talents
wit
and
learning
of
its
editor
captain
shandon
it
was
his
maxim
never
to
lose
the
support
of
a
newspaper
man
and
in
the
course
of
that
evening
he
went
round
and
saluted
every
literary
gentleman
present
with
a
privy
compliment
specially
addressed
to
him
informing
this
one
how
great
an
impression
had
been
made
in
downing
street
by
his
last
article
and
telling
that
one
how
profoundly
his
good
friend
the
duke
of
had
been
struck
by
the
ability
of
the
late
numbers
the
evening
came
to
a
close
and
in
spite
of
all
the
precautions
to
the
contrary
poor
shandon
reeled
in
his
walk
and
went
home
to
his
new
lodgings
with
his
faithful
wife
by
his
side
and
the
cabman
on
his
box
jeering
at
him
wenham
had
a
chariot
of
his
own
which
he
put
at
popjoy
seat
and
the
timid
miss
bunion
seeing
wagg
who
was
her
neighbour
about
to
depart
insisted
upon
a
seat
in
his
carriage
much
to
that
gentleman
discomfiture
pen
and
warrington
walked
home
together
in
the
moonlight
and
now
warrington
said
that
you
have
seen
the
men
of
letters
tell
me
was
i
far
wrong
in
saying
that
there
are
thousands
of
people
in
this
town
who
do
write
books
who
are
to
the
full
as
clever
and
intellectual
as
people
who
do
pen
was
forced
to
confess
that
the
literary
personages
with
whom
he
had
become
acquainted
had
not
said
much
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
that
was
worthy
to
be
remembered
or
quoted
in
fact
not
one
word
about
literature
had
been
said
during
the
whole
course
of
the
night
and
it
may
be
whispered
to
those
uninitiated
people
who
are
anxious
to
know
the
habits
and
make
the
acquaintance
of
men
of
letters
that
there
are
no
race
of
people
who
talk
about
books
or
perhaps
who
read
books
so
little
as
literary
men
chapter
xxxvi
the
pall
mall
gazette
considerable
success
at
first
attended
the
new
journal
it
was
generally
stated
that
an
influential
political
party
supported
the
paper
and
great
names
were
cited
amongst
the
contributors
to
its
columns
was
there
any
foundation
for
these
rumours
we
are
not
at
liberty
to
say
whether
they
were
but
this
much
we
may
divulge
that
an
article
upon
foreign
policy
which
was
generally
attributed
to
a
noble
lord
whose
connexion
with
the
foreign
office
is
very
well
known
was
in
reality
composed
by
captain
shandon
in
the
parlour
of
the
bear
and
staff
near
whitehall
stairs
whither
the
printer
boy
had
tracked
him
and
where
a
literary
ally
of
his
bludyer
had
a
temporary
residence
and
that
a
series
of
papers
on
finance
questions
which
were
universally
supposed
to
be
written
by
a
great
statesman
of
the
house
of
commons
were
in
reality
composed
by
george
warrington
of
the
upper
temple
that
there
may
have
been
some
dealings
between
the
pall
mall
gazette
and
this
influential
party
is
very
possible
percy
popjoy
whose
father
lord
falconet
was
a
member
of
the
party
might
be
seen
not
unfrequently
ascending
the
stairs
to
warrington
chambers
and
some
information
appeared
in
the
paper
which
it
gave
a
character
and
could
only
be
got
from
very
peculiar
sources
several
poems
feeble
in
thought
but
loud
and
vigorous
in
expression
appeared
in
the
pall
mall
gazette
with
the
signature
of
p
and
it
must
be
owned
that
his
novel
was
praised
in
the
new
journal
in
a
very
outrageous
manner
in
the
political
department
of
the
paper
mr
pen
did
not
take
any
share
but
he
was
a
most
active
literary
contributor
the
pall
mall
gazette
had
its
offices
as
we
have
heard
in
catherine
street
in
the
strand
and
hither
pen
often
came
with
his
manuscripts
in
his
pocket
and
with
a
great
deal
of
bustle
and
pleasure
such
as
a
man
feels
at
the
outset
of
his
literary
career
when
to
see
himself
in
print
is
still
a
novel
sensation
and
he
yet
pleases
himself
to
think
that
his
writings
are
creating
some
noise
in
the
world
here
it
was
that
jack
finucane
the
compiled
with
paste
and
scissors
the
journal
of
which
he
was
supervisor
with
an
eagle
eye
he
scanned
all
the
paragraphs
of
all
the
newspapers
which
had
anything
to
do
with
the
world
of
fashion
over
which
he
presided
he
did
let
a
death
or
a
of
the
aristocracy
pass
without
having
the
event
recorded
in
the
columns
of
his
journal
and
from
the
most
recondite
provincial
prints
and
distant
scotch
and
irish
newspapers
he
fished
out
astonishing
paragraphs
and
intelligence
regarding
the
upper
classes
of
society
it
was
a
grand
nay
a
touching
sight
for
a
philosopher
to
see
jack
finucane
esquire
with
a
plate
of
meat
from
the
cookshop
and
glass
of
porter
from
the
for
his
meal
recounting
the
feasts
of
the
great
as
if
he
had
been
present
at
them
and
in
tattered
trousers
and
dingy
cheerfully
describing
and
arranging
the
most
brilliant
fetes
of
the
world
of
fashion
the
incongruity
of
finucane
avocation
and
his
manners
and
appearance
amused
his
new
friend
pen
since
he
left
his
own
native
village
where
his
rank
probably
was
not
very
lofty
jack
had
seldom
seen
any
society
but
such
as
used
the
parlour
of
the
taverns
which
he
frequented
whereas
from
his
writing
you
would
have
supposed
that
he
dined
with
ambassadors
and
that
his
common
lounge
was
the
of
white
errors
of
description
it
is
true
occasionally
slipped
from
his
pen
but
the
ballinafad
sentinel
of
which
he
was
own
correspondent
suffered
by
these
not
the
pall
mall
gazette
in
which
jack
was
not
permitted
to
write
much
his
london
chiefs
thinking
that
the
scissors
and
the
paste
were
better
wielded
by
him
than
the
pen
pen
took
a
great
deal
of
pains
with
the
writing
of
his
reviews
and
having
a
pretty
fair
share
of
desultory
reading
acquired
in
the
early
years
of
his
life
an
eager
fancy
and
a
keen
sense
of
fun
his
articles
pleased
his
chief
and
the
public
and
he
was
proud
to
think
that
he
deserved
the
money
which
he
earned
we
may
be
sure
that
the
pall
mall
gazette
was
taken
in
regularly
at
fairoaks
and
read
with
delight
by
the
two
ladies
there
it
was
received
at
clavering
park
too
where
we
know
there
was
a
young
lady
of
great
literary
tastes
and
old
doctor
portman
himself
to
whom
the
widow
sent
her
paper
after
she
had
got
her
articles
by
heart
signified
his
approval
of
pen
productions
saying
that
the
lad
had
spirit
taste
and
fancy
and
wrote
if
not
like
a
scholar
at
any
rate
like
a
gentleman
and
what
was
the
astonishment
and
delight
of
our
friend
major
pendennis
on
walking
into
one
of
his
clubs
the
regent
where
wenham
lord
falconet
and
some
other
gentlemen
of
good
reputation
and
fashion
were
assembled
to
hear
them
one
day
talking
over
a
number
of
the
pall
mall
gazette
and
of
an
article
which
appeared
in
its
columns
making
some
bitter
fun
of
the
book
recently
published
by
the
wife
of
a
celebrated
member
of
the
opposition
party
the
book
in
question
was
a
book
of
travels
in
spain
and
italy
by
the
countess
of
muffborough
in
which
it
was
difficult
to
say
which
was
the
most
wonderful
the
french
or
the
english
in
which
languages
her
ladyship
wrote
indifferently
and
upon
the
blunders
of
which
the
critic
pounced
with
delightful
mischief
the
critic
was
no
other
than
pen
he
jumped
and
danced
round
about
his
subject
with
the
greatest
jocularity
and
high
spirits
he
showed
up
the
noble
lady
faults
with
admirable
mock
gravity
and
decorum
there
was
not
a
word
in
the
article
which
was
not
polite
and
gentlemanlike
and
the
unfortunate
subject
of
the
criticism
was
scarified
and
laughed
at
during
the
operation
wenham
bilious
countenance
was
puckered
up
with
malign
pleasure
as
he
read
the
critique
lady
muffborough
had
not
asked
him
to
her
parties
during
the
last
year
lord
falconet
giggled
and
laughed
with
all
his
heart
lord
muffborough
and
he
had
been
rivals
ever
since
they
began
life
and
these
complimented
major
pendennis
who
until
now
had
scarcely
paid
any
attention
to
some
hints
which
his
fairoaks
correspondence
threw
out
of
dear
arthur
constant
and
severe
literary
occupations
which
i
fear
may
undermine
the
poor
boy
health
and
had
thought
any
notice
of
mr
pen
and
his
newspaper
connexions
quite
below
his
dignity
as
a
major
and
a
gentleman
but
when
the
oracular
wenham
praised
the
boy
production
when
lord
falconet
who
had
had
the
news
from
percy
popjoy
approved
of
the
genius
of
young
pen
when
the
great
lord
steyne
himself
to
whom
the
major
referred
the
article
laughed
and
sniggered
over
it
swore
it
was
capital
and
that
the
muffborough
would
writhe
under
it
like
a
whale
under
a
harpoon
the
major
as
in
duty
bound
began
to
admire
his
nephew
very
much
said
by
gad
the
young
rascal
had
some
stuff
in
him
and
would
do
something
he
had
always
said
he
would
do
something
and
with
a
hand
quite
tremulous
with
pleasure
the
old
gentleman
sate
down
to
write
to
the
widow
at
fairoaks
all
that
the
great
folks
had
said
in
praise
of
pen
and
he
wrote
to
the
young
rascal
too
asking
when
he
would
come
and
eat
a
chop
with
his
old
uncle
and
saying
that
he
was
commissioned
to
take
him
to
dinner
at
gaunt
house
for
lord
steyne
liked
anybody
who
could
entertain
him
whether
by
his
folly
wit
or
by
his
dulness
by
his
oddity
affectation
good
spirits
or
any
other
quality
pen
flung
his
letter
across
the
table
to
warrington
perhaps
he
was
disappointed
that
the
other
did
not
seem
to
be
much
affected
by
it
the
courage
of
young
critics
is
prodigious
they
clamber
up
to
the
and
with
scarce
a
hesitation
give
their
opinion
upon
works
the
most
intricate
or
profound
had
macaulay
history
or
herschel
astronomy
been
put
before
pen
at
this
period
he
would
have
looked
through
the
volumes
meditated
his
opinion
over
a
cigar
and
signified
his
august
approval
of
either
author
as
if
the
critic
had
been
their
born
superior
and
indulgent
master
and
patron
by
the
help
of
the
biographie
universelle
or
the
british
museum
he
would
be
able
to
take
a
rapid
resume
of
a
historical
period
and
allude
to
names
dates
and
facts
in
such
a
masterly
easy
way
as
to
astonish
his
mamma
at
home
who
wondered
where
her
boy
could
have
acquired
such
a
prodigious
store
of
reading
and
himself
too
when
he
came
to
read
over
his
articles
two
or
three
months
after
they
had
been
composed
and
when
he
had
forgotten
the
subject
and
the
books
which
he
had
consulted
at
that
period
of
his
life
mr
pen
owns
that
he
would
not
have
hesitated
at
hours
notice
to
pass
his
opinion
upon
the
greatest
scholars
or
to
give
a
judgment
upon
the
encyclopaedia
luckily
he
had
warrington
to
laugh
at
him
and
to
keep
down
his
impertinence
by
a
constant
and
wholesome
ridicule
or
he
might
have
become
conceited
beyond
all
sufferance
for
shandon
liked
the
dash
and
flippancy
of
his
young
and
was
indeed
better
pleased
with
pen
light
and
brilliant
flashes
than
with
the
heavier
metal
which
his
elder
coadjutor
brought
to
bear
but
though
he
might
justly
be
blamed
on
the
score
of
impertinence
and
a
certain
prematurity
of
judgment
mr
pen
was
a
perfectly
honest
critic
a
great
deal
too
candid
for
bungay
purposes
indeed
who
grumbled
sadly
at
his
impartiality
pen
and
his
chief
the
captain
had
a
dispute
upon
this
subject
one
day
in
the
name
of
pendennis
shandon
asked
what
have
you
been
doing
praising
one
of
books
bungay
has
been
with
me
in
a
fury
this
morning
at
seeing
a
laudatory
article
upon
one
of
the
works
of
the
odious
firm
over
the
pen
eyes
opened
with
wide
astonishment
do
you
mean
to
say
he
asked
that
we
are
to
praise
no
books
that
bacon
publishes
or
that
if
the
books
are
good
we
are
to
say
they
are
bad
my
good
young
friend
for
what
do
you
suppose
a
benevolent
publisher
undertakes
a
critical
journal
to
benefit
his
rival
shandon
inquired
to
benefit
himself
certainly
but
to
tell
the
truth
too
pen
said
ruat
coelum
to
tell
the
and
my
prospectus
said
shandon
with
a
laugh
and
a
sneer
do
you
consider
that
was
a
work
of
mathematical
accuracy
of
statement
pardon
me
that
is
not
the
question
pen
said
and
i
do
think
you
very
much
care
to
argue
it
i
had
some
qualms
of
conscience
about
that
same
prospectus
and
debated
the
matter
with
my
friend
warrington
we
agreed
however
pen
said
laughing
that
because
the
prospectus
was
rather
declamatory
and
poetical
and
the
giant
was
painted
upon
the
rather
larger
than
the
original
who
was
inside
the
caravan
we
need
not
be
too
scrupulous
about
this
trifling
inaccuracy
but
might
do
our
part
of
the
show
without
loss
of
character
or
remorse
of
conscience
we
are
the
fiddlers
and
play
our
tunes
only
you
are
the
and
leader
of
the
van
said
shandon
well
i
am
glad
that
your
conscience
gave
you
leave
to
play
for
yes
but
said
pen
with
a
fine
sense
of
the
dignity
of
his
position
we
are
all
party
men
in
england
and
i
will
stick
to
my
party
like
a
briton
i
will
be
as
as
you
like
to
our
own
side
he
is
a
fool
who
quarrels
with
his
own
nest
and
i
will
hit
the
enemy
as
hard
as
you
like
but
with
fair
play
captain
if
you
please
one
ca
tell
all
the
truth
i
suppose
but
one
can
tell
nothing
but
the
truth
and
i
would
rather
starve
by
jove
and
never
earn
another
penny
by
my
pen
this
redoubted
instrument
had
now
been
in
use
for
some
six
weeks
and
pen
spoke
of
it
with
vast
enthusiasm
and
respect
than
strike
an
opponent
an
unfair
blow
or
if
called
upon
to
place
him
rank
him
below
his
honest
well
pendennis
when
we
want
bacon
smashed
we
must
get
some
other
hammer
to
do
it
shandon
said
with
fatal
and
very
likely
thought
within
himself
a
few
years
hence
perhaps
the
young
gentleman
wo
be
so
the
veteran
condottiere
himself
was
no
longer
so
scrupulous
he
had
fought
and
killed
on
so
many
a
side
for
many
a
year
past
that
remorse
had
long
left
him
gad
said
he
you
a
tender
conscience
pendennis
it
the
luxury
of
all
novices
and
i
may
have
had
one
once
myself
but
that
sort
of
bloom
wears
off
with
the
rubbing
of
the
world
and
i
not
going
to
the
trouble
myself
of
putting
on
an
artificial
complexion
like
our
pious
friend
wenham
or
our
model
of
virtue
i
do
know
whether
some
people
hypocrisy
is
not
better
captain
than
other
it
more
profitable
at
any
rate
said
the
captain
biting
his
nails
that
wenham
is
as
dull
a
quack
as
ever
quacked
and
you
see
the
carriage
in
which
he
drove
to
dinner
faith
it
be
a
long
time
before
shandon
will
take
a
drive
in
her
own
chariot
god
help
her
poor
thing
and
pen
went
away
from
his
chief
after
their
little
dispute
and
colloquy
pointing
his
own
moral
to
the
captain
tale
and
thinking
to
himself
behold
this
man
stored
with
genius
wit
learning
and
a
hundred
good
natural
gifts
see
how
he
has
wrecked
them
by
paltering
with
his
honesty
and
forgetting
to
respect
himself
wilt
thou
remember
thyself
o
pen
thou
art
conceited
enough
wilt
thou
sell
thy
honour
for
a
bottle
no
by
heaven
grace
we
will
be
honest
whatever
befalls
and
our
mouths
shall
only
speak
the
truth
when
they
a
punishment
or
at
least
a
trial
was
in
store
for
mr
pen
in
the
very
next
number
of
the
pall
mall
gazette
warrington
read
out
with
roars
of
laughter
an
article
which
by
no
means
amused
arthur
pendennis
who
was
himself
at
work
with
a
criticism
for
the
next
week
number
of
the
same
journal
and
in
which
the
spring
annual
was
ferociously
maltreated
by
some
unknown
writer
the
person
of
all
most
cruelly
mauled
was
pen
himself
his
verses
had
not
appeared
with
his
own
name
in
the
spring
annual
but
under
an
assumed
signature
as
he
had
refused
to
review
the
book
shandon
had
handed
it
over
to
bludyer
with
directions
to
that
author
to
dispose
of
it
and
he
had
done
so
effectually
bludyer
who
was
a
man
of
very
considerable
talent
and
of
a
race
which
i
believe
is
quite
extinct
in
the
press
of
our
time
had
a
certain
notoriety
in
his
profession
and
reputation
for
savage
humour
he
smashed
and
trampled
down
the
poor
spring
flowers
with
no
more
mercy
than
a
bull
would
have
on
a
parterre
and
having
cut
up
the
volume
to
his
heart
content
went
and
sold
it
at
a
bookstall
and
purchased
a
pint
of
brandy
with
the
proceeds
of
the
volume
chapter
xxxvii
where
pen
appears
in
town
and
country
let
us
be
allowed
to
pass
over
a
few
months
of
the
history
of
arthur
pendennis
lifetime
during
the
which
many
events
may
have
occurred
which
were
more
interesting
and
exciting
to
himself
than
they
would
be
likely
to
prove
to
the
reader
of
his
present
memoirs
we
left
him
in
his
last
chapter
regularly
entered
upon
his
business
as
a
professional
writer
or
literary
hack
as
warrington
chooses
to
style
himself
and
his
friend
and
we
know
how
the
life
of
any
hack
legal
or
literary
in
a
curacy
or
in
a
marching
regiment
or
at
a
merchant
desk
is
dull
of
routine
and
tedious
of
description
one
day
labour
resembles
another
much
too
closely
a
literary
man
has
often
to
work
for
his
bread
against
time
or
against
his
will
or
in
spite
of
his
health
or
of
his
indolence
or
of
his
repugnance
to
the
subject
on
which
he
is
called
to
exert
himself
just
like
any
other
daily
toiler
when
you
want
to
make
money
by
pegasus
as
he
must
perhaps
who
has
no
other
saleable
property
farewell
poetry
and
aerial
flights
pegasus
only
rises
now
like
green
balloon
at
periods
advertised
beforehand
and
when
the
spectator
money
has
been
paid
pegasus
trots
in
harness
over
the
stony
pavement
and
pulls
a
cart
or
a
cab
behind
him
often
pegasus
does
his
work
with
panting
sides
and
trembling
knees
and
not
seldom
gets
a
cut
of
the
whip
from
his
driver
do
not
let
us
however
be
too
prodigal
of
our
pity
upon
pegasus
there
is
no
reason
why
this
animal
should
be
exempt
from
labour
or
illness
or
decay
any
more
than
any
of
the
other
creatures
of
god
world
if
he
gets
the
whip
pegasus
often
deserves
it
and
i
for
one
am
quite
ready
to
protest
my
friend
george
warrington
against
the
doctrine
which
poetical
sympathisers
are
inclined
to
put
forward
that
of
letters
and
what
is
called
genius
are
to
be
exempt
from
prose
duties
of
this
daily
life
and
not
to
be
made
to
work
and
pay
like
their
neighbours
well
then
the
pall
mall
gazette
being
duly
established
and
arthur
pendennis
merits
recognised
as
a
flippant
witty
and
amusing
critic
he
worked
away
hard
every
week
preparing
reviews
of
such
works
as
came
into
his
department
and
writing
his
reviews
with
flippancy
certainly
but
with
honesty
and
to
the
best
of
his
power
it
might
be
that
a
historian
of
threescore
who
had
spent
a
quarter
of
a
century
in
composing
a
work
of
which
our
young
gentleman
disposed
in
the
course
of
a
couple
of
days
reading
at
the
british
museum
was
not
altogether
fairly
treated
by
such
a
facile
critic
or
that
a
poet
who
had
been
elaborating
sublime
sonnets
and
odes
until
he
thought
them
fit
for
the
public
and
for
fame
was
annoyed
by
two
or
three
dozen
pert
lines
in
mr
pen
review
in
which
the
poet
claims
were
settled
by
the
critic
as
if
the
latter
were
my
lord
on
the
bench
and
the
author
a
miserable
little
suitor
trembling
before
him
the
actors
at
the
theatres
complained
of
him
wofully
too
and
very
likely
he
was
too
hard
upon
them
but
there
was
not
much
harm
done
after
all
it
is
different
now
as
we
know
but
there
were
so
few
great
historians
or
great
poets
or
great
actors
in
pen
time
that
scarce
any
at
all
came
up
for
judgment
before
his
critical
desk
those
who
got
a
little
whipping
got
what
in
the
main
was
good
for
them
not
that
the
judge
was
any
better
or
wiser
than
the
persons
whom
he
sentenced
or
indeed
ever
fancied
himself
so
pen
had
a
strong
sense
of
humour
and
justice
and
had
not
therefore
an
overweening
respect
for
his
own
works
besides
he
had
his
friend
warrington
at
his
elbow
a
terrible
critic
if
the
young
man
was
disposed
to
be
conceited
and
more
savage
over
pen
than
ever
he
was
to
those
whom
he
tried
at
his
literary
assize
by
these
critical
labours
and
by
occasional
contributions
to
leading
articles
of
the
journal
when
without
wounding
his
paper
this
eminent
publicist
could
conscientiously
speak
his
mind
arthur
pendennis
gained
the
sum
of
four
pounds
four
shillings
weekly
and
with
no
small
pains
and
labour
likewise
be
furnished
magazines
and
reviews
with
articles
of
his
composition
and
is
believed
to
have
been
though
on
this
score
he
never
chooses
to
speak
london
correspondent
of
the
chatteris
champion
which
at
that
time
contained
some
very
brilliant
and
eloquent
letters
from
the
metropolis
by
these
labours
the
fortunate
youth
was
enabled
to
earn
a
sum
very
nearly
equal
to
four
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
on
the
second
christmas
after
his
arrival
in
london
he
actually
brought
a
hundred
pounds
to
his
mother
as
a
dividend
upon
the
debt
which
he
owed
to
laura
that
pendennis
read
every
word
of
her
son
works
and
considered
him
to
be
the
profoundest
thinker
and
most
elegant
writer
of
the
day
that
she
thought
his
retribution
of
the
hundred
pounds
an
act
of
angelic
virtue
that
she
feared
he
was
ruining
his
health
by
his
labours
and
was
delighted
when
he
told
her
of
the
society
which
he
met
and
of
the
great
men
of
letters
and
fashion
whom
he
saw
will
be
imagined
by
all
readers
who
have
seen
amongst
mothers
and
that
charming
simplicity
of
love
with
which
women
in
the
country
watch
the
career
of
their
darlings
in
london
if
john
has
held
such
and
such
a
brief
if
tom
has
been
invited
to
such
and
such
a
ball
or
george
has
met
this
or
that
great
and
famous
man
at
dinner
what
a
delight
there
is
in
the
hearts
of
mothers
and
sisters
at
home
in
somersetshire
how
young
hopeful
letters
are
read
and
remembered
what
a
theme
for
village
talk
they
give
and
friendly
congratulation
in
the
second
winter
pen
came
for
a
very
brief
space
and
cheered
the
heart
and
lightened
up
the
lonely
house
at
fairoaks
helen
had
her
son
all
to
herself
laura
was
away
on
a
visit
to
old
lady
rockminster
the
folks
of
clavering
park
were
absent
the
very
few
old
friends
of
the
house
doctor
portman
at
their
head
called
upon
mr
pen
and
treated
him
with
marked
respect
between
mother
and
son
it
was
all
fondness
confidence
and
affection
it
was
the
happiest
fortnight
of
the
whole
life
perhaps
in
the
lives
of
both
of
them
the
holiday
was
gone
only
too
quickly
and
pen
was
back
in
the
busy
world
and
the
gentle
widow
alone
again
she
sent
arthur
money
to
laura
i
do
know
why
this
young
lady
took
the
opportunity
of
leaving
home
when
pen
was
coming
thither
or
whether
he
was
the
more
piqued
or
relieved
by
her
absence
he
was
by
this
time
by
his
own
merits
and
his
uncle
introductions
pretty
well
introduced
into
london
and
known
both
in
literary
and
polite
circles
amongst
the
former
his
fashionable
reputation
stood
him
in
no
little
stead
he
was
considered
to
be
a
gentleman
of
good
present
means
and
better
expectations
who
wrote
for
his
pleasure
than
which
there
can
not
be
a
greater
recommendation
to
a
young
literary
aspirant
bacon
bungay
and
were
proud
to
accept
his
articles

looked
upon
him
with
a
favourable
eye
and
they
reported
how
they
met
him
at
the
houses
of
persons
of
fashion
amongst
whom
he
was
pretty
welcome
as
they
did
not
trouble
themselves
about
his
means
present
or
future
as
his
appearance
and
address
were
good
and
as
he
had
got
a
character
for
being
a
clever
fellow
finally
he
was
asked
to
one
house
because
he
was
seen
at
another
house
and
thus
no
small
varieties
of
london
life
were
presented
to
the
young
man
he
was
made
familiar
with
all
sorts
of
people
from
paternoster
row
to
pimlico
and
was
as
much
at
home
at
mayfair
as
at
those
tavern
boards
where
some
of
his
companions
of
the
pen
were
accustomed
to
assemble
full
of
high
spirits
and
curiosity
easily
adapting
himself
to
all
whom
he
met
the
young
fellow
pleased
himself
in
this
strange
variety
and
jumble
of
men
and
made
himself
welcome
or
at
ease
at
least
wherever
he
went
he
would
breakfast
for
instance
at
plover
of
a
morning
in
company
with
a
peer
a
bishop
a
parliamentary
orator
two
blue
ladies
of
fashion
a
popular
preacher
the
author
of
the
last
new
novel
and
the
very
latest
lion
imported
from
egypt
or
from
america
and
would
quit
this
distinguished
society
for
the
back
room
at
the
newspaper
office
where
pens
and
ink
and
the
wet
were
awaiting
him
here
would
be
finucane
the
with
the
last
news
from
the
row
and
shandon
would
come
in
presently
and
giving
a
nod
to
pen
would
begin
scribbling
his
leading
article
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
flanked
by
the
pint
of
sherry
which
when
the
attendant
boy
beheld
him
was
always
silently
brought
for
the
captain
or
bludyer
roaring
voice
would
be
heard
in
the
front
room
where
that
truculent
critic
would
impound
the
books
on
the
counter
in
spite
of
the
timid
remonstrances
of
midge
the
publisher
and
after
looking
through
the
volumes
would
sell
them
at
his
accustomed
bookstall
and
having
drunken
and
dined
upon
the
produce
of
the
sale
in
a
tavern
box
would
call
for
ink
and
paper
and
proceed
to
smash
the
author
of
his
dinner
and
the
novel
towards
evening
mr
pen
would
stroll
in
the
direction
of
his
club
and
take
up
warrington
there
for
a
constitutional
walk
this
exercise
freed
the
lungs
and
gave
an
appetite
for
dinner
after
which
pen
had
the
privilege
to
make
his
bow
at
some
very
pleasant
houses
which
were
opened
to
him
or
the
town
before
him
for
amusement
there
was
the
opera
or
the
eagle
tavern
or
a
ball
to
go
to
in
mayfair
or
a
quiet
night
with
a
cigar
and
a
book
and
a
long
talk
with
warrington
or
a
wonderful
new
song
at
the
back
kitchen
at
this
time
of
his
life
mr
pen
beheld
all
sorts
of
places
and
men
and
very
likely
did
not
know
how
much
he
enjoyed
himself
until
long
after
when
balls
gave
him
no
pleasure
neither
did
farces
make
him
laugh
nor
did
the
tavern
joke
produce
the
least
excitement
in
him
nor
did
the
loveliest
dancer
that
ever
showed
her
ankles
cause
him
to
stir
from
his
chair
after
dinner
at
his
present
mature
age
all
these
pleasures
are
over
and
the
times
have
passed
away
too
it
is
but
a
very
very
few
years
since
but
the
time
is
gone
and
most
of
the
men
bludyer
will
no
more
bully
authors
or
cheat
landlords
of
their
score
shandon
the
learned
and
thriftless
the
witty
and
unwise
sleeps
his
last
sleep
they
buried
honest
doolan
the
other
day
never
will
he
cringe
or
flatter
never
pull
or
empty
any
more
the
london
season
was
now
blooming
in
its
full
vigour
and
the
fashionable
newspapers
abounded
with
information
regarding
the
grand
banquets
routs
and
balls
which
were
enlivening
the
polite
world
our
gracious
sovereign
was
holding
levees
and
at
james
the
of
the
clubs
were
crowded
with
the
heads
of
respectable
gentlemen
along
the
serpentine
trailed
thousands
of
carriages
squadrons
of
dandy
horsemen
trampled
over
rotten
row
everybody
was
in
town
in
a
word
and
of
course
major
arthur
pendennis
who
was
somebody
was
not
absent
with
his
head
tied
up
in
a
smart
bandana
handkerchief
and
his
meagre
carcass
enveloped
in
a
brilliant
turkish
the
worthy
gentleman
sate
on
a
certain
morning
by
his
fireside
letting
his
feet
gently
simmer
in
a
bath
whilst
he
took
his
early
cup
of
tea
and
perused
his
morning
post
he
could
not
have
faced
the
day
without
his
two
hours
toilet
without
his
early
cup
of
tea
without
his
morning
post
i
suppose
nobody
in
the
world
except
morgan
not
even
master
himself
knew
how
feeble
and
ancient
the
major
was
growing
and
what
numberless
little
comforts
he
required
if
men
sneer
as
our
habit
is
at
the
artifices
of
an
old
beauty
at
her
paint
perfumes
ringlets
at
those
innumerable
and
to
us
unknown
stratagems
with
which
she
is
said
to
remedy
the
ravages
of
time
and
reconstruct
the
charms
whereof
years
have
bereft
her
the
ladies
it
is
to
be
presumed
are
not
on
their
side
altogether
ignorant
that
men
are
vain
as
well
as
they
and
that
the
toilets
of
old
bucks
are
to
the
full
as
elaborate
as
their
own
how
is
it
that
old
blushington
keeps
that
constant
little
on
his
cheeks
and
where
does
old
blondel
get
the
preparation
which
makes
his
silver
hair
pass
for
golden
have
you
ever
seen
lord
hotspur
get
off
his
horse
when
he
thinks
nobody
is
looking
taken
out
of
his
stirrups
his
shiny
boots
can
hardly
totter
up
the
steps
of
hotspur
house
he
is
a
dashing
young
nobleman
still
as
you
see
the
back
of
him
in
rotten
row
when
you
behold
him
on
foot
what
an
old
old
fellow
did
you
ever
form
to
yourself
any
idea
of
dick
lacy
dick
has
been
dick
these
sixty
years
in
a
natural
state
and
without
his
stays
all
these
men
are
objects
whom
the
observer
of
human
life
and
manners
may
contemplate
with
as
much
profit
as
the
most
elderly
belgravian
venus
or
inveterate
mayfair
jezebel
an
old
reprobate
who
has
never
said
his
prayers
except
perhaps
in
public
these
fifty
years
an
old
buck
who
still
clings
to
as
many
of
the
habits
of
youth
as
his
feeble
grasp
of
health
can
hold
by
who
has
given
up
the
bottle
but
sits
with
young
fellows
over
it
and
tells
naughty
stories
upon
who
has
given
up
beauty
but
still
talks
about
it
as
wickedly
as
the
youngest
roue
in
company
such
an
old
fellow
i
say
if
any
parson
in
pimlico
or
james
were
to
order
the
beadles
to
bring
him
into
the
middle
aisle
and
there
set
him
in
an
armchair
and
make
a
text
of
him
and
preach
about
him
to
the
congregation
could
be
turned
to
a
wholesome
use
for
once
in
his
life
and
might
be
surprised
to
find
that
some
good
thoughts
came
out
of
him
but
we
are
wandering
from
our
text
the
honest
major
who
sits
all
this
while
with
his
feet
cooling
in
the
bath
morgan
takes
them
out
of
that
place
of
purification
and
dries
them
daintily
and
proceeds
to
set
the
old
gentleman
on
his
legs
with
waistband
and
wig
starched
cravat
and
spotless
boots
and
gloves
it
was
during
these
hours
of
the
toilet
that
morgan
and
his
employer
had
their
confidential
conversations
for
they
did
not
meet
much
at
other
times
of
the
day
the
major
abhorring
the
society
of
his
own
chairs
and
tables
in
his
lodgings
and
morgan
his
master
toilet
over
and
letters
delivered
had
his
time
very
much
on
his
own
hands
this
spare
time
the
active
and
gentleman
bestowed
among
the
valets
and
butlers
of
the
nobility
his
acquaintance
and
morgan
pendennis
as
he
was
styled
for
by
such
compound
names
gentlemen
are
called
in
their
private
circles
was
a
frequent
and
welcome
guest
at
some
of
the
very
highest
tables
in
this
town
he
was
a
member
of
two
influential
clubs
in
mayfair
and
pimlico
and
he
was
thus
enabled
to
know
the
whole
gossip
of
the
town
and
entertain
his
master
very
agreeably
during
the
two
hours
toilet
conversation
he
knew
a
hundred
tales
and
legends
regarding
persons
of
the
very
highest
ton
whose
valets
canvass
their
august
secrets
just
my
dear
madam
as
our
own
and
dependants
in
the
kitchen
discuss
our
characters
our
stinginess
and
generosity
our
pecuniary
means
or
embarrassments
and
our
little
domestic
or
connubial
tiffs
and
quarrels
if
i
leave
this
manuscript
open
on
my
table
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
betty
will
read
it
and
they
will
talk
it
over
in
the
lower
regions
and
she
will
bring
in
my
breakfast
with
a
face
of
such
entire
imperturbable
innocence
that
no
mortal
could
suppose
her
guilty
of
playing
the
spy
if
you
and
the
captain
have
high
words
upon
any
subject
which
is
just
possible
the
circumstances
of
the
quarrel
and
the
characters
of
both
of
you
will
be
discussed
with
impartial
eloquence
over
the
kitchen
and
if
smith
maid
should
by
chance
be
taking
a
dish
of
tea
with
yours
her
presence
will
not
undoubtedly
act
as
a
restraint
upon
the
discussion
in
question
her
opinion
will
be
given
with
candour
and
the
next
day
her
mistress
will
probably
know
that
captain
and
jones
have
been
a
quarrelling
as
usual
nothing
is
secret
take
it
as
a
rule
that
john
knows
everything
and
as
in
our
humble
world
so
in
the
greatest
a
duke
is
no
more
a
hero
to
his
than
you
or
i
and
his
grace
man
at
his
club
in
company
doubtless
with
other
men
of
equal
social
rank
talks
over
his
master
character
and
affairs
with
the
ingenuous
truthfulness
which
befits
gentlemen
who
are
met
together
in
confidence
who
is
a
niggard
and
screws
up
his
who
is
in
the
hands
of
the
and
is
putting
his
noble
name
on
the
back
of
bills
of
exchange
who
is
intimate
with
whose
wife
who
wants
whom
to
marry
her
daughter
and
which
he
wo
no
not
at
any
price
all
these
facts
confidential
gentlemen
discuss
confidentially
and
are
known
and
examined
by
every
person
who
has
any
claim
to
rank
in
genteel
society
in
a
word
if
old
pendennis
himself
was
said
to
know
everything
and
was
at
once
admirably
scandalous
and
delightfully
discreet
it
is
but
justice
to
morgan
to
say
that
a
great
deal
of
his
master
information
was
supplied
to
that
worthy
man
by
his
valet
who
went
out
and
foraged
knowledge
for
him
indeed
what
more
effectual
plan
is
there
to
get
a
knowledge
of
london
society
than
to
begin
at
the
foundation
that
is
at
the
kitchen
floor
so
morgan
and
his
employer
conversed
as
the
latter
toilet
proceeded
there
had
been
a
on
the
previous
day
and
the
major
read
among
the
presentations
that
of
lady
clavering
by
lady
rockminster
and
of
miss
amory
by
her
mother
lady
clavering
and
in
a
further
part
of
the
paper
their
dresses
were
described
with
a
precision
and
in
a
jargon
which
will
puzzle
and
amuse
the
antiquary
of
future
generations
the
sight
of
these
names
carried
pendennis
back
to
the
country
how
long
have
the
claverings
been
in
london
he
asked
pray
morgan

you
seen
any
of
their
people

the
valet
with
a
pathetic
voice

the
major

and
not

compassion

his
name

and
the
major

time
with
hearty
sympathy

a
tremenjuous
row
about
that

a
row

cried
the
major
amazed
at
a
peculiar
expression
in
countenance

his
imperturbable
demeanour
know

about
it
sir
servants
do
know
them
kind
of
things
the
least
most
probbly
there

so
many

about

marobblan

and
all
the
feller
ad
a

and

and
he
took
a
lodging
at

he
hankered
about

primises
and
it
was
said
that
madam
fribsy
the
milliner
brought
letters
to
miss
hamory
though
i
do
believe
a
word
about
it
nor
that
he
tried
to
pison
hisself
with
charcoal
which
it
was
all
a
humbug
betwigst
him
and
madam
fribsy
and
he
was
nearly
shot
by
the
keeper
in
the
in
the
course
of
that
very
day
it
chanced
that
the
major
had
stationed
himself
in
the
great
window
of
bays
club
in
saint
james
street
at
the
hour
in
the
afternoon
when
you
see
a
of
respectable
old
bucks
similarly
recreating
themselves
bays
is
rather
an
place
of
resort
now
and
many
of
its
members
more
than
but
in
the
time
of
the
prince
regent
these
old
fellows
occupied
the
same
window
and
were
some
of
the
very
greatest
dandies
in
this
empire
major
pendennis
was
looking
from
the
great
window
and
spied
his
nephew
arthur
walking
down
the
street
in
company
with
his
friend
popjoy
look
said
popjoy
to
pen
as
they
passed
did
you
ever
pass
at
four
without
seeing
that
collection
of
old
fogies
a
regular
museum
they
ought
to
be
cast
in
wax
and
set
up
at
madame

and
the
young
sinner
took
leave
of
pen
and
the
club
of
the
elder
criminals
and
sauntered
into
blacquiere
an
adjacent
establishment
frequented
by
reprobates
of
his
own
age
colchicum
blondel
and
the
senior
bucks
had
just
been
conversing
about
the
clavering
family
whose
appearance
in
london
had
formed
the
subject
of
major
pendennis
morning
conversation
with
his
valet
house
was
next
to
that
of
sir
francis
clavering
in
grosvenor
place
giving
very
good
dinners
himself
he
had
remarked
some
activity
in
his
neighbour
kitchen
sir
francis
indeed
had
a
new
chef
who
had
come
in
more
than
once
and
dressed
blondel
dinner
for
him
that
gentleman
having
only
a
remarkably
expert
female
artist
permanently
engaged
in
his
establishment
and
employing
such
chiefs
of
note
as
happened
to
be
free
on
the
occasion
of
his
grand
banquets
they
go
to
a
devilish
expense
and
see
devilish
bad
company
as
yet
i
hear
blondel
said
they
scour
the
streets
by
gad
to
get
people
to
dine
with
champignon
says
it
breaks
his
heart
to
serve
up
a
dinner
to
their
society
what
a
shame
it
is
that
those
low
people
should
have
money
at
all
cried
blondel
whose
grandfather
had
been
a
reputable
maker
and
whose
father
had
lent
money
to
the
princes
i
wish
i
had
fallen
in
with
the
widow

sighed
lord
colchicum
and
not
been
laid
up
with
that
confounded
gout
at
leghorn

my
nephew
walking
with
with
mine
the
infernal
young
scamp
said
lord
colchicum
glowering
at
popjoy
out
of
his
heavy
eyebrows
and
he
turned
away
from
the
window
as
major
pendennis
tapped
upon
it
the
major
was
in
high
the
sun
was
bright
the
air
brisk
and
invigorating
he
had
determined
upon
a
visit
to
lady
clavering
on
that
day
and
bethought
him
that
arthur
would
be
a
good
companion
for
the
walk
across
the
green
park
to
her
ladyship
door
master
pen
was
not
displeased
to
accompany
his
illustrious
relative
who
pointed
out
a
dozen
great
men
in
that
brief
transit
through
james
street
and
got
bows
from
a
duke
at
a
crossing
a
bishop
on
a
cob
and
a
cabinet
minister
with
an
umbrella
the
duke
gave
the
elder
pendennis
a
finger
of
a
glove
to
shake
which
the
major
embraced
with
great
veneration
and
all
pen
blood
tingled
as
he
found
himself
in
actual
communication
as
it
were
with
this
famous
man
for
pen
had
possession
of
the
major
left
arm
whilst
the
gentleman
other
wing
was
engaged
with
his
grace
right
and
he
wished
all
grey
friars
school
all
oxbridge
university
all
paternoster
row
and
the
temple
and
laura
and
his
mother
at
fairoaks
could
be
standing
on
each
side
of
the
street
to
see
the
meeting
between
him
and
his
uncle
and
the
most
famous
duke
in
christendom
how
do
pendennis
fine
day
were
his
grace
remarkable
words
and
with
a
nod
of
his
august
head
he
passed
on
in
a
blue
and
spotless
white
duck
trousers
in
a
white
stock
with
a
shining
buckle
behind
old
pendennis
whose
likeness
to
his
grace
has
been
remarked
began
to
imitate
him
unconsciously
after
they
had
parted
speaking
with
curt
sentences
after
the
manner
of
the
great
man
we
have
all
of
us
no
doubt
met
with
more
than
one
military
officer
who
has
so
imitated
the
manner
of
a
certain
great
captain
of
the
age
and
has
perhaps
changed
his
own
natural
character
and
disposition
because
fate
had
endowed
him
with
an
aquiline
nose
in
like
manner
have
we
not
seen
many
another
man
pride
himself
on
having
a
tall
forehead
and
a
supposed
likeness
to
canning
many
another
go
through
life
swelling
with
on
account
of
an
imagined
resemblance
we
say
imagined
because
that
anybody
should
be
really
like
that
most
beautiful
and
perfect
of
men
is
impossible
to
the
great
and
revered
george
iv
many
third
parties
who
wore
low
necks
to
their
dresses
because
they
fancied
that
lord
byron
and
themselves
were
similar
in
appearance
and
has
not
the
grave
closed
but
lately
upon
poor
tom
bickerstaff
who
having
no
more
imagination
than
joseph
hume
looked
in
the
glass
and
fancied
himself
like
shakspeare
shaved
his
forehead
so
as
farther
to
resemble
the
immortal
bard
wrote
tragedies
incessantly
and
died
perfectly
crazy
actually
perished
of
his
forehead
these
or
similar
freaks
of
vanity
most
people
who
have
frequented
the
world
must
have
seen
in
their
experience
pen
laughed
in
his
roguish
sleeve
at
the
manner
in
which
his
uncle
began
to
imitate
the
great
man
from
whom
they
had
just
parted
but
mr
pen
was
as
vain
in
his
own
way
perhaps
as
the
elder
gentleman
and
strutted
with
a
very
consequential
air
of
his
own
by
the
major
side
yes
my
dear
boy
said
the
old
bachelor
as
they
sauntered
through
the
green
park
where
many
poor
children
were
disporting
happily
and
were
playing
at
and
black
sheep
were
grazing
in
the
sunshine
and
an
actor
was
learning
his
part
on
a
bench
and
and
their
charges
sauntered
here
and
there
and
several
couples
were
walking
in
a
leisurely
manner
yes
depend
on
it
my
boy
for
a
poor
man
there
is
nothing
like
having
good
acquaintances
who
were
those
men
with
whom
you
saw
me
in
the
at
bays
two
were
peers
of
the
realm
hobananob
will
be
a
peer
as
soon
as
his
dies
and
he
has
had
his
third
seizure
and
of
the
other
four
not
one
has
less
than
his
seven
thousand
a
year
did
you
see
that
dark
blue
brougham
with
that
tremendous
stepping
horse
waiting
at
the
door
of
the
club
you
know
it
again
it
is
sir
hugh
trumpington
he
was
never
known
to
walk
in
his
life
never
appears
in
the
streets
on
foot
never
and
if
he
is
going
two
doors
off
to
see
his
mother
the
old
dowager
to
whom
i
shall
certainly
introduce
you
for
she
receives
some
of
the
best
company
in
london
gad
sir
he
mounts
his
horse
at
no
and
dismounts
again
at
no
a
he
is
now
upstairs
at
bays
playing
picquet
with
count
punter
he
is
the
player
in
england
as
well
he
may
be
for
he
plays
every
day
of
his
life
except
sundays
for
sir
hugh
is
an
uncommonly
religious
man
from
three
till
seven
when
he
dresses
for
dinner
a
very
pious
manner
of
spending
his
time
pen
said
laughing
and
thinking
that
his
uncle
was
falling
into
the
twaddling
state
gad
sir
that
is
not
the
question
a
man
of
his
estate
may
employ
his
time
as
he
chooses
when
you
are
a
baronet
a
county
member
with
ten
thousand
acres
of
the
best
land
in
cheshire
and
such
a
place
as
trumpington
though
he
never
goes
there
you
may
do
as
you
and
so
that
was
his
brougham
sir
was
it
the
nephew
said
with
almost
a
sneer
his
brougham
o
ay
yes
and
that
brings
me
back
to
my
point
revenons
a
nos
moutons
yes
begad
revenons
a
nous
moutons
well
that
brougham
is
mine
if
i
choose
between
four
and
seven
just
as
much
mine
as
if
i
jobbed
it
from
tilbury
begad
for
thirty
pound
a
month
sir
hugh
is
the
best
natured
fellow
in
the
world
and
if
it
had
been
so
fine
an
afternoon
as
it
is
you
and
i
would
have
been
in
that
brougham
at
this
very
minute
on
our
way
to
grosvenor
place
that
is
the
benefit
of
knowing
rich
men
i
dine
for
nothing
sir
i
go
into
the
country
and
i
mounted
for
nothing
other
fellows
keep
hounds
and
gamekeepers
for
me
sic
vos
non
vobis
as
we
used
to
say
at
grey
friars
hey
i
of
the
opinion
of
my
old
friend
leech
of
the
and
a
devilish
good
shrewd
fellow
he
was
as
most
scotchmen
are
gad
sir
leech
used
to
say
was
so
poor
that
he
could
afford
to
know
a
poor
man
you
do
act
up
to
your
principles
uncle
pen
said
up
to
my
principles
how
sir
the
major
asked
rather
testily
you
would
have
cut
me
in
saint
james
street
sir
pen
said
were
your
practice
not
more
benevolent
than
your
theory
you
who
live
with
dukes
and
magnates
of
the
land
and
would
take
no
notice
of
a
poor
devil
like
by
which
speech
we
may
see
that
mr
pen
was
getting
on
in
the
world
and
could
flatter
as
well
as
laugh
in
his
sleeve
major
pendennis
was
appeased
instantly
and
very
much
pleased
he
tapped
affectionately
his
nephew
arm
on
which
he
was
leaning
and
said
you
sir
you
are
my
flesh
and
blood
hang
it
sir
i
been
very
proud
of
you
and
very
fond
of
you
but
for
your
confounded
follies
and
extravagances
and
wild
oats
sir
which
i
hope
you
sown
i
hope
you
sown
begad
my
object
arthur
is
to
make
a
man
of
you
to
see
you
well
placed
in
the
world
as
becomes
one
of
your
name
and
my
own
sir
you
have
got
yourself
a
little
reputation
by
your
literary
talents
which
i
am
very
far
from
undervaluing
though
in
my
time
begad
poetry
and
genius
and
that
sort
of
thing
were
devilish
disreputable
there
was
poor
byron
for
instance
who
ruined
himself
and
contracted
the
worst
habits
by
living
with
poets
and
and
people
of
that
kind
but
the
times
are
changed
now
there
a
run
upon
literature
clever
fellows
get
into
the
best
houses
in
town
begad
tempora
mutantur
sir
and
by
jove
i
suppose
whatever
is
is
right
as
shakspeare
pen
did
not
think
fit
to
tell
his
uncle
who
was
the
author
who
had
made
use
of
that
remarkable
phrase
and
here
descending
from
the
green
park
the
pair
made
their
way
into
grosvenor
place
and
to
the
door
of
the
mansion
occupied
there
by
sir
francis
and
lady
clavering
the
shutters
of
this
handsome
mansion
were
freshly
gilded
the
knockers
shone
gorgeous
upon
the
newly
painted
door
the
balcony
before
the
bloomed
with
a
portable
garden
of
the
most
beautiful
plants
and
with
flowers
white
and
pink
and
scarlet
the
windows
of
the
upper
room
the
sacred
chamber
and
of
my
lady
doubtless
and
even
a
pretty
little
casement
of
the
third
story
which
mr
pen
presumed
to
belong
to
the
virgin
bedroom
of
miss
blanche
amory
were
similarly
adorned
with
floral
ornaments
and
the
whole
exterior
face
of
the
house
presented
the
most
brilliant
aspect
which
fresh
new
paint
shining
newly
cleaned
bricks
and
spotless
mortar
could
offer
to
the
beholder
how
strong
must
have
rejoiced
in
organising
all
this
splendour
thought
pen
he
recognised
the
chevalier
genius
in
the
magnificence
before
him
lady
clavering
is
going
out
for
her
drive
the
major
said
we
shall
only
have
to
leave
our
pasteboards
he
used
the
word
having
heard
it
from
some
of
the
ingenuous
youth
of
the
nobility
about
town
and
as
a
modern
phrase
suited
to
pen
tender
years
indeed
as
the
two
gentlemen
reached
the
door
a
landau
drove
up
a
magnificent
yellow
carriage
lined
with
brocade
or
satin
of
a
faint
cream
colour
drawn
by
wonderful
grey
horses
with
flaming
ribbons
and
harness
blazing
all
over
with
crests
no
less
than
three
of
these
heraldic
emblems
surmounted
the
on
the
panels
and
these
shields
contained
a
prodigious
number
of
quarterings
betokening
the
antiquity
and
splendour
of
the
house
of
clavering
and
snell
a
coachman
in
a
tight
silver
wig
surmounted
the
magnificent
whereon
the
same
arms
were
worked
in
bullion
and
controlled
the
prancing
greys
a
young
man
still
but
of
a
solemn
countenance
with
a
laced
waistcoat
and
buckles
in
his
shoes
little
buckles
unlike
those
which
john
and
jeames
the
footmen
wear
and
which
we
know
are
large
and
spread
elegantly
over
the
foot
one
of
the
leaves
of
the
hall
door
was
opened
and
john
one
of
the
largest
of
his
race
was
leaning
against
the
with
his
ambrosial
hair
powdered
his
legs
crossed
beautiful
in
his
hand
his
cane
dolichoskion
jeames
was
invisible
but
near
at
hand
waiting
in
the
hall
with
the
gentleman
who
does
not
wear
livery
and
ready
to
fling
down
the
roll
of
over
which
her
ladyship
was
to
step
to
her
carriage
these
things
and
men
the
which
to
tell
of
demands
time
are
seen
in
the
glance
of
a
practised
eye
and
in
fact
the
major
and
pen
had
scarcely
crossed
the
street
when
the
second
battant
of
the
door
flew
open
the
carpet
tumbled
down
the
to
those
of
the
carriage
john
was
opening
it
on
one
side
of
the
emblazoned
door
and
jeames
on
the
other
the
two
ladies
attired
in
the
highest
style
of
fashion
and
accompanied
by
a
third
who
carried
a
blenheim
spaniel
yelping
in
a
light
blue
ribbon
came
forth
to
ascend
the
carriage
miss
amory
was
the
first
to
enter
which
she
did
with
aerial
lightness
and
took
the
place
which
she
liked
best
lady
clavering
next
followed
but
her
ladyship
was
more
mature
of
age
and
heavy
of
foot
and
one
of
those
feet
attired
in
a
green
satin
boot
with
some
part
of
a
stocking
which
was
very
fine
whatever
the
ankle
might
be
which
it
encircled
might
be
seen
swaying
on
the
as
her
ladyship
leaned
for
support
on
the
arm
of
the
unbending
jeames
by
the
enraptured
observer
of
female
beauty
who
happened
to
be
passing
at
the
time
of
this
imposing
ceremonial
the
pendennises
senior
and
junior
beheld
those
charms
as
they
came
up
to
the
door
the
major
looking
grave
and
courtly
and
pen
somewhat
abashed
at
the
carriage
and
its
owners
for
he
thought
of
sundry
little
passages
at
clavering
which
made
his
heart
beat
rather
quick
at
that
moment
lady
clavering
looking
round
the
pair
she
was
on
the
first
and
would
have
been
in
the
vehicle
in
another
second
but
she
gave
a
start
backwards
which
caused
some
of
the
powder
to
fly
from
the
hair
of
ambrosial
jeames
and
crying
out
lor
if
it
is
arthur
pendennis
and
the
old
major
jumped
back
to
terra
firma
directly
and
holding
out
two
fat
hands
encased
in
tight
gloves
the
woman
warmly
greeted
the
major
and
his
nephew
come
in
both
of
why
have
you
been
before
get
out
blanche
and
come
and
see
your
old
o
i
so
glad
to
see
you
been
waitin
and
waitin
for
you
ever
so
long
come
in
luncheon
gone
down
cried
out
this
hospitable
lady
squeezing
pen
hand
in
both
hers
she
had
dropped
the
major
after
a
brief
wrench
of
recognition
and
blanche
casting
up
her
eyes
towards
the
chimneys
descended
from
the
carriage
presently
with
a
timid
blushing
appealing
look
and
gave
a
little
hand
to
major
pendennis
the
companion
with
the
spaniel
looked
about
irresolute
and
doubting
whether
she
should
not
take
fido
his
airing
but
she
too
turned
right
about
face
and
entered
the
house

xxxviii
in
which
the

reappears
better
folks
than
morgan
the
valet
were
not
so
well
instructed
as
that
gentleman
regarding
the
amount
of
lady
clavering
riches
and
the
legend
in
london
upon
her
ladyship
arrival
in
the
polite
metropolis
was
that
her
fortune
was
enormous
indigo
factories
opium
clippers
banks
overflowing
with
rupees
diamonds
and
jewels
of
native
princes
and
vast
sums
of
interest
paid
by
them
for
loans
contracted
by
themselves
or
their
predecessors
to
lady
clavering
father
were
mentioned
as
sources
of
her
wealth
her
account
at
her
london
was
positively
known
and
the
sum
embraced
so
many
cyphers
as
to
create
as
many
o
of
admiration
in
the
wondering
hearer
it
was
a
known
fact
that
an
envoy
from
an
indian
prince
a
colonel
altamont
the
nawaub
of
lucknow
prime
favourite
an
extraordinary
man
who
had
it
was
said
embraced
mahometanism
and
undergone
a
thousand
wild
and
perilous
adventures
was
at
present
in
this
country
trying
to
negotiate
with
the
begum
clavering
the
sale
of
the
nawaub
celebrated
diamond
light
of
the
dewan
under
the
title
of
the
begum
lady
clavering
fame
began
to
spread
in
london
before
she
herself
descended
upon
the
capital
and
as
it
has
been
the
boast
of
delolme
and
blackstone
and
all
panegyrists
of
the
british
constitution
that
we
admit
into
our
aristocracy
merit
of
every
kind
and
that
the
man
if
he
but
deserve
it
may
wear
the
robes
of
a
peer
and
sit
alongside
of
a
cavendish
or
a
stanley
so
it
ought
to
be
the
boast
of
our
good
society
that
haughty
though
it
be
naturally
jealous
of
its
privileges
and
careful
who
shall
be
admitted
into
its
circle
yet
if
an
individual
be
but
rich
enough
all
barriers
are
instantly
removed
and
he
or
she
is
welcomed
as
from
his
wealth
he
merits
to
be
this
fact
shows
our
british
independence
and
honest
feeling
our
higher
orders
are
not
such
mere
haughty
aristocrats
as
the
ignorant
represent
them
on
the
contrary
if
a
man
have
money
they
will
hold
out
their
hands
to
him
eat
his
dinners
dance
at
his
balls
marry
his
daughters
or
give
their
own
lovely
girls
to
his
sons
as
affably
as
your
commonest
roturier
would
do
as
he
had
superintended
the
arrangements
of
the
country
mansion
our
friend
the
chevalier
strong
gave
the
benefit
of
his
taste
and
advice
to
the
fashionable
london
upholsterers
who
prepared
the
town
house
for
the
reception
of
the
clavering
family
in
the
decoration
of
this
elegant
abode
honest
strong
soul
rejoiced
as
much
as
if
he
had
been
himself
its
proprietor
he
hung
and
the
pictures
he
studied
the
positions
of
sofas
he
had
interviews
with
wine
merchants
and
purveyors
who
were
to
supply
the
new
establishment
and
at
the
same
time
the
baronet
factotum
and
confidential
friend
took
the
opportunity
of
furnishing
his
own
chambers
and
stocking
his
snug
little
cellar
his
friends
complimented
him
upon
the
neatness
of
the
former
and
the
select
guests
who
came
in
to
share
strong
cutlet
now
found
a
bottle
of
excellent
claret
to
accompany
the
meal
the
chevalier
was
now
as
he
said
in
clover
he
had
a
very
comfortable
set
of
rooms
in
inn
he
was
waited
on
by
a
former
spanish
legionary
and
comrade
of
his
whom
he
had
left
at
a
breach
of
a
spanish
fort
and
found
at
a
crossing
in
road
and
whom
he
had
elevated
to
the
rank
of
to
himself
and
to
the
chum
who
at
present
shared
his
lodgings
this
was
no
other
than
the
favourite
of
the
nawaub
of
lucknow
the
valiant
colonel
altamont
no
man
was
less
curious
or
at
any
rate
more
discreet
than
ned
strong
and
he
did
not
care
to
inquire
into
the
mysterious
connexion
which
very
soon
after
their
first
meeting
at
baymouth
was
established
between
sir
francis
clavering
and
the
envoy
of
the
nawaub
the
latter
knew
some
secret
regarding
the
former
which
put
clavering
into
his
power
somehow
and
strong
who
knew
that
his
patron
early
life
had
been
rather
irregular
and
that
his
career
with
his
regiment
in
india
had
not
been
brilliant
supposed
that
the
colonel
who
swore
he
knew
clavering
well
at
calcutta
had
some
hold
upon
sir
francis
to
which
the
latter
was
forced
to
yield
in
truth
strong
had
long
understood
sir
francis
clavering
character
as
that
of
a
man
utterly
weak
in
purpose
in
principle
and
intellect
a
moral
and
physical
trifler
and
poltroon
with
poor
clavering
his
excellency
had
had
one
or
two
interviews
after
their
baymouth
meeting
the
nature
of
which
conversations
the
baronet
did
not
confide
to
strong
although
he
sent
letters
to
altamont
by
that
gentleman
who
was
his
ambassador
in
all
sorts
of
affairs
on
one
of
these
occasions
the
nawaub
envoy
must
have
been
in
an
exceeding
ill
humour
for
he
crushed
clavering
letter
in
his
hand
and
said
with
his
own
particular
manner
and
emphasis
a
hundred
be
hanged
i
have
no
more
letters
nor
no
more
tell
clavering
i
have
a
thousand
or
by
jove
split
and
burst
him
all
to
atoms
let
him
give
me
a
thousand
and
go
abroad
and
i
give
you
my
honour
as
a
gentleman
i
not
ask
him
for
no
more
for
a
year
give
him
that
message
from
me
strong
my
boy
and
tell
him
if
the
money
ai
here
next
friday
at
twelve
as
sure
as
my
name
what
it
is
i
have
a
paragraph
in
the
newspaper
on
saturday
and
next
week
i
blow
up
the
whole
strong
carried
back
these
words
to
his
principal
on
whom
their
effect
was
such
that
actually
on
the
day
and
hour
appointed
the
chevalier
made
his
appearance
once
more
at
altamont
hotel
at
baymouth
with
the
sum
of
money
required
altamont
was
a
gentleman
he
said
and
behaved
as
such
he
paid
his
bill
at
the
inn
and
the
baymouth
paper
announced
his
departure
on
a
foreign
tour
strong
saw
him
embark
at
dover
it
must
be
forgery
at
the
very
least
he
thought
that
has
put
clavering
into
this
fellow
power
and
the
colonel
has
got
the
before
the
year
was
out
however
this
happy
country
saw
the
colonel
once
more
upon
its
shores
a
confounded
run
on
the
red
had
finished
him
he
said
at
baden
baden
no
gentleman
could
stand
against
a
colour
coming
up
fourteen
times
he
had
been
obliged
to
draw
upon
sir
francis
clavering
for
means
of
returning
home
and
clavering
though
pressed
for
money
for
he
had
election
expenses
had
set
up
his
establishment
in
the
country
and
was
engaged
in
furnishing
his
london
house
yet
found
means
to
accept
colonel
altamont
bill
though
evidently
very
much
against
his
will
for
in
strong
hearing
sir
francis
wished
to
heaven
with
many
curses
that
the
colonel
could
have
been
locked
up
in
a
goal
in
germany
for
life
so
that
he
might
never
be
troubled
again
these
sums
for
the
colonel
sir
francis
was
obliged
to
raise
without
the
knowledge
of
his
wife
for
though
perfectly
liberal
nay
sumptuous
in
her
expenditure
the
good
lady
had
inherited
a
tolerable
aptitude
for
business
along
with
the
large
fortune
of
her
father
snell
and
gave
to
her
husband
only
such
a
handsome
allowance
as
she
thought
befitted
a
gentleman
of
his
rank
now
and
again
she
would
give
him
a
present
or
pay
an
outstanding
gambling
debt
but
she
always
exacted
a
pretty
accurate
account
of
the
moneys
so
required
and
respecting
the
subsidies
to
the
colonel
clavering
fairly
told
strong
that
he
could
speak
to
his
wife
part
of
strong
business
in
life
was
to
procure
this
money
and
other
sums
for
his
patron
and
in
the
chevalier
apartments
in
shepherd
inn
many
negotiations
took
place
between
gentlemen
of
the
moneyed
world
and
sir
francis
clavering
and
many
valuable
and
pieces
of
stamped
paper
were
passed
between
them
when
a
man
has
been
in
the
habit
of
getting
in
debt
from
his
early
youth
and
of
exchanging
his
promises
to
pay
at
twelve
months
against
present
sums
of
money
it
would
seem
as
if
no
piece
of
good
fortune
ever
permanently
benefited
him
a
little
while
after
the
advent
of
prosperity
the
is
pretty
certain
to
be
in
the
house
again
and
the
bills
with
the
old
signature
in
the
market
clavering
found
it
more
convenient
to
see
these
gentry
at
strong
lodgings
than
at
his
own
and
such
was
the
chevalier
friendship
for
the
baronet
that
although
he
did
not
possess
a
shilling
of
his
own
his
name
might
be
seen
as
the
drawer
of
almost
all
the
bills
of
exchange
which
sir
francis
clavering
accepted
having
drawn
clavering
bills
he
got
them
discounted
in
the
when
they
became
due
he
parleyed
with
the
and
gave
them
instalments
of
their
debt
or
got
time
in
exchange
for
fresh
acceptances
regularly
or
irregularly
gentlemen
must
live
somehow
and
as
we
read
how
the
other
day
at
comorn
the
troops
forming
that
garrison
were
gay
and
lively
acted
plays
danced
at
balls
and
consumed
their
rations
though
menaced
with
an
assault
from
the
enemy
without
the
walls
and
with
a
gallows
if
the
austrians
were
successful
so
there
are
hundreds
of
gallant
spirits
in
this
town
walking
about
in
good
spirits
dining
every
day
in
tolerable
gaiety
and
plenty
and
going
to
sleep
comfortably
with
a
bailiff
always
more
or
less
near
and
a
rope
of
debt
round
their
necks
the
which
trifling
inconveniences
ned
strong
the
old
soldier
bore
very
easily
but
we
shall
have
another
opportunity
of
making
acquaintance
with
these
and
some
other
interesting
inhabitants
of
shepherd
inn
and
in
the
meanwhile
are
keeping
lady
clavering
and
her
friends
too
long
waiting
on
the
of
grosvenor
place
first
they
went
into
the
gorgeous
fitted
up
lady
clavering
could
for
goodness
gracious
tell
why
in
the
style
unless
said
her
ladyship
laughing
because
me
and
clavering
are
people
and
here
they
were
offered
the
copious
remains
of
the
luncheon
of
which
lady
clavering
and
blanche
had
just
partaken
when
nobody
was
near
our
little
sylphide
who
scarcely
ate
at
dinner
more
than
the
six
grains
of
rice
of
amina
the
friend
of
the
ghouls
in
the
arabian
nights
was
most
active
with
her
knife
and
fork
and
consumed
a
very
substantial
portion
of
mutton
cutlets
in
which
piece
of
hypocrisy
it
is
believed
she
resembled
other
young
ladies
of
fashion
pen
and
his
uncle
declined
the
refection
but
they
admired
the
with
fitting
compliments
and
pronounced
it
very
chaste
that
being
the
proper
phrase
there
were
indeed
dutch
chairs
of
the
seventeenth
century
there
was
a
sculptured
carved
buffet
of
the
sixteenth
there
was
a
sideboard
robbed
out
of
the
carved
work
of
a
church
in
the
low
countries
and
a
large
brass
cathedral
lamp
over
the
round
oak
table
there
were
old
family
portraits
from
wardour
street
and
tapestry
from
france
bits
of
armour
swords
and
made
of
statuettes
of
saints
and
dresden
china
nothing
in
a
word
could
be
chaster
behind
the
was
the
library
fitted
with
busts
and
books
all
of
a
size
and
wonderful
and
solemn
bronzes
in
the
severe
classic
style
here
it
was
that
guarded
by
double
doors
sir
francis
smoked
cigars
and
read
bell
life
in
london
and
went
to
sleep
after
dinner
when
he
was
not
smoking
over
the
at
his
clubs
or
punting
at
the
in
saint
james
but
what
could
equal
the
chaste
splendour
of
the
the
carpets
were
so
magnificently
fluffy
that
your
foot
made
no
more
noise
on
them
than
your
shadow
on
their
white
ground
bloomed
roses
and
tulips
as
big
as
about
the
room
were
high
chairs
and
low
chairs
chairs
chairs
so
attenuated
that
it
was
a
wonder
any
but
a
sylph
could
sit
upon
them
covered
with
marvellous
gimcracks
china
ornaments
of
all
ages
and
countries
bronzes
gilt
daggers
books
of
beauty
yataghans
turkish
papooshes
and
boxes
of
parisian
bonbons
wherever
you
sate
down
there
were
dresden
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
convenient
at
your
elbow
there
were
moreover
light
blue
poodles
and
ducks
and
cocks
and
hens
in
porcelain
there
were
nymphs
by
boucher
and
shepherdesses
by
greuze
very
chaste
indeed
there
were
muslin
curtains
and
brocade
curtains
gilt
cages
with
parroquets
and
two
squealing
cockatoos
each
and
the
other
a
clock
singing
tunes
on
a
and
another
booming
the
hours
like
great
tom
on
the
mantelpiece
there
was
in
a
word
everything
that
comfort
could
desire
and
the
most
elegant
taste
devise
a
london
fitted
up
without
regard
to
expense
is
surely
one
of
the
noblest
and
most
curious
sights
of
the
present
day
the
romans
of
the
lower
empire
the
dear
marchionesses
and
countesses
of
louis
could
scarcely
have
had
a
finer
taste
than
our
modern
folks
exhibit
and
everybody
who
saw
lady
clavering
reception
rooms
was
forced
to
confess
that
they
were
most
elegant
and
that
the
prettiest
rooms
in
london
lady
harley
quin
lady
hanway
wardour
or
own
the
great
railroad
croesus
wife
were
not
fitted
up
with
a
more
consummate
poor
lady
clavering
meanwhile
knew
little
regarding
these
things
and
had
a
sad
want
of
respect
for
the
splendours
around
her
i
only
know
they
cost
a
precious
deal
of
money
major
she
said
to
her
guest
and
that
i
do
advise
you
to
try
one
of
them
gossamer
gilt
chairs
i
came
down
on
one
the
night
we
gave
our
second
why
did
you
come
and
see
us
before
we
have
asked
you
to
you
would
have
liked
to
see
mamma
break
a
chair
would
you
pendennis
dear
blanche
said
with
a
sneer
she
was
angry
because
pen
was
talking
and
laughing
with
mamma
because
mamma
had
made
a
number
of
blunders
in
describing
the
house
for
a
hundred
other
good
reasons
i
should
like
to
have
been
by
to
give
lady
clavering
my
arm
if
she
had
need
of
it
pen
answered
with
a
bow
and
a
blush
quel
preux
chevalier
cried
the
sylphide
tossing
up
her
little
head
i
have
a
with
those
who
fall
remember

i
suffered
myself
very
much
from
doing
so
and
you
went
home
to
laura
to
console
you
said
miss
amory
pen
winced
he
did
not
like
the
remembrance
of
the
consolation
which
laura
had
given
to
him
nor
was
he
very
well
pleased
to
find
that
his
rebuff
in
that
quarter
was
known
to
the
world
so
as
he
had
nothing
to
say
in
reply
he
began
to
be
immensely
interested
in
the
furniture
round
about
him
and
to
praise
lady
clavering
taste
with
all
his
might
no
do
praise
me
said
honest
lady
clavering
it
all
the
upholsterer
doings
and
captain
strong
they
did
it
all
while
we
was
at
the
park
and
and
lady
rockminster
has
been
here
and
says
the
salongs
are
very
well
said
lady
clavering
with
an
air
and
tone
of
great
deference
my
cousin
laura
has
been
staying
with
her
pen
said
it
not
the
dowager
it
is
the
lady
indeed
cried
major
pendennis
when
he
heard
this
great
name
of
fashion
if
you
have
her
ladyship
approval
lady
clavering
you
can
not
be
far
wrong
no
no
you
can
not
be
far
wrong
lady
rockminster
i
should
say
arthur
is
the
very
centre
of
the
circle
of
fashion
and
taste
the
rooms
are
beautiful
indeed
and
the
major
voice
hushed
as
he
spoke
of
this
great
lady
and
he
looked
round
and
surveyed
the
apartments
awfully
and
respectfully
as
if
he
had
been
at
church
yes
lady
rockminster
has
took
us
up
said
lady
clavering
taken
us
up
mamma
cried
blanche
in
a
shrill
voice
well
taken
us
up
then
said
my
lady
it
very
kind
of
her
and
i
dare
say
we
shall
like
it
when
we
git

to
it
only
at
first

do
fancy

took
well
taken
up
at
all
she
is
going
to
give
our
balls
for
us
and
wants
to
invite
all
our
dinners
but
i
wo
stand
that
i
will
have
my
old
friends
and
i
wo
let
her
send
all
the
cards

and

mum
at
the
head
of
my
own
table
you
must
come
to
me
arthur
and
major
come
let
me
see
on
the
it
ai
one
of
our
grand
dinners
blanche
she
said
looking
round
at
her
daughter
who
bit
her
lips
and
frowned
very
savagely
for
a
sylphide
the
major
with
a
smile
and
a
bow
said
he
would
much
rather
come
to
a
quiet
meeting
than
to
a
grand
dinner
he
had
had
enough
of
those
large
entertainments
and
preferred
the
simplicity
of
the
home
circle
i
always
think
a
dinner
the
best
the
second
day
said
lady
clavering
thinking
to
mend
her
first
speech
on
the
we
be
quite
a
snug
little
party
at
which
second
blunder
miss
blanche
clasped
her
hands
in
despair
and
said
o
mamma
vous
etes
major
pendennis
vowed
that
he
liked
snug
dinners
of
all
things
in
the
world
and
confounded
her
ladyship
impudence
for
daring
to
ask
such
a
man
as
him
to
a
second
day
dinner
but
he
was
a
man
of
an
economical
turn
of
mind
and
bethinking
himself
that
he
could
throw
over
these
people
if
anything
better
should
offer
he
accepted
with
the
blandest
air
as
for
pen
he
was
not
a
of
thirty
standing
as
yet
and
the
idea
of
a
fine
feast
in
a
fine
house
was
still
perfectly
welcome
to
him
what
was
that
pretty
little
quarrel
which
engaged
itself
between
your
worship
and
miss
amory
the
major
asked
of
pen
as
they
walked
away
together
i
thought
you
used
to
au
mieux
in
that
used
to
be
answered
pen
with
a
dandified
air
is
a
vague
phrase
regarding
a
woman
was
and
is
are
two
very
different
terms
sir
as
regards
women
hearts
especially
egad
they
change
as
we
do
cried
the
elder
when
we
took
the
cape
of
good
hope
i
recollect
there
was
a
lady
who
talked
poisoning
herself
for
your
humble
servant
and
begad
in
three
months
she
ran
away
from
her
husband
with
somebody
else
do
get
yourself
entangled
with
that
miss
amory
she
is
forward
affected
and
and
her
character
is
somewhat
never
mind
what
but
do
think
of
her
ten
thousand
pound
wo
do
for
you
what
my
good
fellow
is
ten
thousand
pound
i
would
scarcely
pay
that
girl
milliner
bill
with
the
interest
of
the
you
seem
to
be
a
connoisseur
in
millinery
uncle
pen
said
i
was
sir
i
was
replied
the
senior
and
the
old
you
know
never
hears
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
but
he
begins
to
he
he
you
understand
and
he
gave
a
killing
and
somewhat
superannuated
leer
and
bow
to
a
carriage
that
passed
them
and
entered
the
park
lady

he
said
fine
girls
the
daughters
though
gad
i
remember
their
mother
a
thousand
times
handsomer
no
arthur
my
dear
fellow
with
your
person
and
expectations
you
ought
to
make
a
good
coup
in
marriage
some
day
or
other
and
though
i
would
have
this
repeated
at
fairoaks
you
rogue
ha
ha
a
reputation
for
a
little
wickedness
and
for
being
an
homme
dangereux
do
hurt
a
young
fellow
with
the
women
they
like
it
sir
they
hate
a
milksop
young
men
must
be
young
men
you
know
but
for
marriage
continued
the
veteran
moralist
that
is
a
very
different
matter
marry
a
woman
with
money
i
told
you
before
it
is
as
easy
to
get
a
rich
wife
as
a
poor
one
and
a
doosed
deal
more
comfortable
to
sit
down
to
a
dinner
with
your
little
entrees
nicely
served
than
to
have
nothing
but
a
damned
cold
leg
of
mutton
between
you
and
your
wife
we
shall
have
a
good
dinner
on
the
when
we
dine
with
sir
francis
clavering
stick
to
that
my
boy
in
your
relations
with
the
family
cultivate
but
keep
for
dining
no
more
of
your
youthful
follies
and
nonsense
about
love
in
a
it
must
be
a
cottage
with
a
double
a
cottage
of
gentility
sir
said
pen
quoting
the
hackneyed
ballad
of
the
devil
walk
but
his
uncle
did
not
know
that
poem
though
perhaps
he
might
be
leading
pen
upon
the
very
promenade
in
question
and
went
on
with
his
philosophical
remarks
very
much
pleased
with
the
aptness
of
the
pupil
to
whom
he
addressed
them
indeed
arthur
pendennis
was
a
clever
fellow
who
took
his
colour
very
readily
from
his
neighbour
and
found
the
adaptation
only
too
easy
warrington
the
grumbler
growled
out
that
pen
was
becoming
such
a
puppy
that
soon
there
would
be
no
bearing
him
but
the
truth
is
the
young
man
success
and
dashing
manners
pleased
his
elder
companion
he
liked
to
see
pen
gay
and
spirited
and
brimful
of
health
and
life
and
hope
as
a
man
who
has
long
since
left
off
being
amused
with
clown
and
harlequin
still
gets
a
pleasure
in
watching
a
child
at
a
pantomime

former
sulkiness
disappeared
with
his
better
fortune

he
bloomed

appears
and
disappears
on
the
day
appointed
major
pendennis
who
had
formed
no
better
engagement
and
arthur
who
desired
none
arrived
together
to
dine
with
sir
francis
clavering
the
only
tenants
of
the
when
pen
and
his
uncle
reached
it
were
sir
francis
and
his
wife
and
our
friend
captain
strong
whom
arthur
was
very
glad
to
see
though
the
major
looked
very
sulkily
at
strong
being
by
no
means
well
pleased
to
sit
down
to
dinner
with
clavering
d
as
he
irreverently
called
strong
but
welbore
welbore
clavering
country
neighbour
and
brother
member
of
parliament
speedily
arriving
pendennis
the
elder
was
somewhat
appeased
for
welbore
though
perfectly
dull
and
taking
no
more
part
in
the
conversation
at
dinner
than
the
footman
behind
his
chair
was
a
respectable
country
gentleman
of
ancient
family
and
seven
thousand
a
year
and
the
major
felt
always
at
ease
in
such
society
to
these
were
added
other
persons
of
note
the
dowager
lady
rockminster
who
had
her
reasons
for
being
well
with
the
clavering
family
and
the
lady
agnes
foker
with
her
son
harry
our
old
acquaintance
pynsent
could
not
come
his
parliamentary
duties
keeping
him
at
the
house
duties
which
sate
upon
the
two
other
senators
very
lightly
miss
blanche
amory
was
the
last
of
the
company
who
made
her
appearance
she
was
dressed
in
a
killing
white
silk
dress
which
displayed
her
pearly
shoulders
to
the
utmost
advantage
foker
whisped
to
pen
who
regarded
her
with
eyes
of
evident
admiration
that
he
considered
her
a
she
chose
to
be
very
gracious
to
arthur
upon
this
day
and
held
out
her
hand
most
cordially
and
talked
about
dear
fairoaks
and
asked
for
dear
laura
and
his
mother
and
said
she
was
longing
to
go
back
to
the
country
and
in
fact
was
entirely
simple
affectionate
and
artless
harry
foker
thought
he
had
never
seen
anybody
so
amiable
and
delightful
not
accustomed
much
to
the
society
of
ladies
and
ordinarily
being
dumb
to
their
presence
he
found
that
he
could
speak
before
miss
amory
and
became
uncommonly
lively
and
talkative
even
before
the
dinner
was
announced
and
the
party
descended
to
the
lower
rooms
he
would
have
longed
to
give
his
arm
to
the
fair
blanche
and
conduct
her
down
the
broad
carpeted
stair
but
she
fell
to
the
lot
of
pen
upon
this
occasion
foker
being
appointed
to
escort
welbore
welbore
in
consequence
of
his
superior
rank
as
an
earl
grandson
but
though
he
was
separated
from
the
object
of
his
desire
during
the
passage
downstairs
the
delighted
foker
found
himself
by
miss
side
at
the
and
flattered
himself
that
he
had
manoeuvred
very
well
in
securing
that
happy
place
it
may
be
that
the
move
was
not
his
but
that
it
was
made
by
another
person
blanche
had
thus
the
two
young
men
one
on
each
side
of
her
and
each
tried
to
render
himself
gallant
and
agreeable
foker
mamma
from
her
place
surveying
her
darling
boy
was
surprised
at
his
vivacity
harry
talked
constantly
to
his
fair
neighbour
about
the
topics
of
the
day
seen
taglioni
in
the
sylphide
miss
amory
bring
me
that
souprame
of
volile
again
if
you
please
this
was
addressed
to
the
attendant
near
him
very
good
ca
think
where
the
souprames
come
from
what
becomes
of
the
legs
of
the
fowls
i
wonder
she
clipping
in
the
sylphide
ai
she
and
he
began
very
kindly
to
hum
the
pretty
air
which
pervades
that
prettiest
of
all
ballets
now
faded
into
the
past
with
that
most
beautiful
and
gracious
of
all
dancers
will
the
young
folks
ever
see
anything
so
charming
anything
so
classic
anything
like
taglioni
miss
amory
is
a
sylph
herself
said
mr
pen
what
a
delightful
tenor
voice
you
have
foker
said
the
young
lady
i
am
sure
you
have
been
well
taught
i
sing
a
little
myself
i
should
like
to
sing
with
pen
remembered
that
words
very
similar
had
been
addressed
to
himself
by
the
young
lady
and
that
she
had
liked
to
sing
with
him
in
former
days
and
sneering
within
himself
he
wondered
with
how
many
other
gentlemen
she
had
sung
duets
since
his
time
but
he
did
not
think
fit
to
put
this
awkward
question
aloud
and
only
said
with
the
very
tenderest
air
which
he
could
assume
i
should
like
to
hear
you
sing
again
miss
blanche
i
never
heard
a
voice
i
liked
so
well
as
yours
i
i
thought
you
liked
laura
said
miss
blanche
laura
is
a
contralto
and
that
voice
is
very
often
out
you
know
pen
said
bitterly
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
of
music
in
london
he
continued
i
tired
of
those
professional
people
they
sing
too
loud
or
i
have
grown
too
old
or
too
blase
one
grows
old
very
soon
in
london
miss
amory
and
like
all
old
fellows
i
only
care
for
the
songs
i
heard
in
my
i
like
english
music
best
i
do
care
for
foreign
songs
much
get
me
some
saddle
of
mutton
said
foker
i
adore
english
ballads
of
all
things
said
miss
amory
sing
me
one
of
the
old
songs
after
dinner
will
you
said
pen
with
an
imploring
voice
shall
i
sing
you
an
english
song
after
dinner
asked
the
sylphide
turning
to
foker
i
will
if
you
will
promise
to
come
up
soon
and
she
gave
him
a
perfect
broadside
of
her
eyes
i
come
up
after
dinner
fast
enough
he
said
simply
i
do
care
about
much
wine
afterwards
i
take
my
whack
at
dinner
i
mean
my
share
you
know
and
when
i
have
had
as
much
as
i
want
i
toddle
up
to
tea
a
domestic
character
miss
amory
my
habits
are
simple
and
when
pleased
i
generally
in
a
ai
i
pen
that
jelly
if
you
please
not
that
one
the
other
with
the
cherries
inside
how
the
doose
do
they
get
those
cherries
inside
the
jellies
in
this
way
the
artless
youth
prattled
on
and
miss
amory
listened
to
him
with
inexhaustible
when
the
ladies
took
their
departure
for
the
upper
regions
blanche
made
the
two
young
men
promise
faithfully
to
quit
the
table
soon
and
departed
with
kind
glances
to
each
she
dropped
her
gloves
on
foker
side
of
the
table
and
her
handkerchief
on
pen
each
had
had
some
little
attention
paid
to
him
her
politeness
to
foker
was
perhaps
a
little
more
encouraging
than
her
kindness
to
arthur
but
the
benevolent
little
creature
did
her
best
to
make
both
the
gentlemen
happy
foker
caught
her
last
glance
as
she
rushed
out
of
the
door
that
bright
look
passed
over
strong
broad
white
waistcoat
and
shot
straight
at
harry
foker
the
door
closed
on
the
charmer
he
sate
down
with
a
sigh
and
swallowed
a
bumper
of
claret
as
the
dinner
at
which
pen
and
his
uncle
took
their
places
was
not
one
of
our
grand
parties
it
had
been
served
at
a
considerably
earlier
hour
than
those
ceremonial
banquets
of
the
london
season
which
custom
has
ordained
shall
scarcely
take
place
before
nine
and
the
company
being
small
and
miss
blanche
anxious
to
betake
herself
to
her
piano
in
the
giving
constant
hints
to
her
mother
to
retreat
lady
clavering
made
that
signal
very
speedily
so
that
it
was
quite
daylight
yet
when
the
ladies
reached
the
upper
apartments
from
the
balconies
of
which
they
could
command
a
view
of
the
two
parks
of
the
poor
couples
and
children
still
sauntering
in
the
one
and
of
the
equipages
of
ladies
and
the
horses
of
dandies
passing
through
the
arch
of
the
other
the
sun
in
a
word
had
not
set
behind
the
elms
of
kensington
gardens
and
was
still
gilding
the
statue
erected
by
the
ladies
of
england
in
honour
of
his
grace
the
duke
of
wellington
when
lady
clavering
and
her
female
friends
left
the
gentlemen
drinking
wine
the
windows
of
the
were
opened
to
let
in
the
fresh
air
and
afforded
to
the
in
the
street
a
pleasant
or
perhaps
tantalising
view
of
six
gentlemen
in
white
waistcoats
with
a
quantity
of
decanters
and
a
variety
of
fruits
before
them
little
boys
as
they
passed
and
jumped
up
at
the
and
took
a
peep
said
to
one
another
hi
hi
jim
should
you
like
to
be
there
and
have
a
cut
of
that
there
pineapple
the
horses
and
carriages
of
the
nobility
and
gentry
passed
by
conveying
them
to
belgravian
toilets
the
policeman
with
clamping
feet
patrolled
up
and
down
before
the
mansion
the
shades
of
evening
began
to
fall
the
gasman
came
and
lighted
the
lamps
before
sir
francis
door
the
butler
entered
the
and
illuminated
the
antique
gothic
chandelier
over
the
antique
carved
oak
so
that
from
outside
the
house
you
looked
inwards
upon
a
of
feasting
and
and
from
within
you
beheld
a
vision
of
a
calm
summer
evening
and
the
wall
of
saint
james
park
and
the
sky
above
in
which
a
star
or
two
was
just
beginning
to
twinkle
jeames
with
folded
legs
leaning
against
the
of
his
master
abode
looked
forth
musingly
upon
the
latter
tranquil
sight
whilst
a
spectator
clinging
to
the
railings
examined
the
former
scene
policeman
x
passing
gave
his
attention
to
neither
but
fixed
it
upon
the
individual
holding
by
the
railings
and
gazing
into
sir
francis
clavering
where
strong
was
laughing
and
talking
away
making
the
conversation
for
the
party
the
man
at
the
railing
was
very
gorgeously
attired
with
chains
jewellery
and
waistcoats
which
the
illumination
from
the
house
lighted
up
to
great
advantage
his
boots
were
shiny
he
had
brass
buttons
to
his
coat
and
large
white
wristbands
over
his
knuckles
and
indeed
looked
so
grand
that
x
imagined
he
beheld
a
member
of
parliament
or
a
person
of
consideration
before
him
whatever
his
rank
however
the
or
person
of
consideration
was
considerably
excited
by
wine
for
he
lurched
and
reeled
somewhat
in
his
gait
and
his
hat
was
cocked
over
his
wild
and
bloodshot
eyes
in
a
manner
which
no
sober
hat
ever
could
assume
his
copious
black
hair
was
evidently
surreptitious
and
his
whiskers
of
the
tyrian
purple
as
strong
laughter
following
after
one
of
his
own
gros
mots
came
ringing
out
of
window
this
gentleman
without
laughed
and
sniggered
in
the
queerest
way
likewise
and
he
slapped
his
thigh
and
winked
at
jeames
pensive
in
the
portico
as
much
as
to
say
plush
my
boy
is
that
a
good
story
jeames
attention
had
been
gradually
drawn
from
the
moon
in
the
heavens
to
this
sublunary
scene
and
he
was
puzzled
and
alarmed
by
the
appearance
of
the
man
in

boots
a
holtercation
he
remarked
afterwards
in
the
a
holtercation
with
a
feller
in
the
streets
is
never
no
good
and
indeed
he
was
not
hired
for
any
such
so
having
surveyed
the
man
for
some
time
who
went
on
laughing
reeling
nodding
his
head
with
tipsy
knowingness
jeames
looked
out
of
the
portico
and
softly
called
pleaceman
and
beckoned
to
that
officer
x
marched
up
resolute
with
one
berlin
glove
stuck
in
his
and
jeames
simply
pointed
with
his
index
finger
to
the
individual
who
was
laughing
against
the
railings
not
one
single
word
more
than
pleaceman
did
he
say
but
stood
there
in
the
calm
summer
evening
pointing
calmly
a
grand
sight
x
advanced
to
the
individual
and
said
now
sir
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
move
hon
the
individual
who
was
in
perfect
did
not
appear
to
hear
one
word
which
policeman
x
uttered
but
nodded
and
waggled
his
grinning
head
at
strong
until
his
hat
almost
fell
from
his
head
over
the
area
railings
now
sir
move
on
do
you
hear
cries
x
in
a
much
more
peremptory
tone
and
he
touched
the
stranger
gently
with
one
of
the
fingers
enclosed
in
the
gauntlets
of
the
berlin
woof
he
of
the
many
rings
instantly
started
or
rather
staggered
back
into
what
is
called
an
attitude
of
and
in
that
position
began
the
operation
which
is
entitled
at
policeman
x
and
showed
himself
brave
and
warlike
if
unsteady
hullo
keep
your
hands
off

gentleman
he
said
with
an
oath
which
need
not
be
repeated

and

the

with
a
satiric
laugh
and
sneer

with
a
look
of
annoyance
got
up
from
the
table
and
ran
out
to
the
intruder
a
gentleman
in
a
white
waistcoat
running
out
from
a
bareheaded
a
policeman
and
an
individual
decently
attired
engaged
in
almost
fisticuffs
on
the
pavement
were
enough
to
make
a
crowd
even
in
that
quiet
neighbourhood
at
eight
in
the
evening
and
a
small
mob
began
to
assemble
before
sir
francis
clavering

for
god
sake
come
in
strong
said
seizing
his
acquaintance

added
in
an
under
voice
to
that
domestic
and
carrying
the
excited
gentleman
out
of
the
street
the
outer
door
was
closed
upon
him
and
the
small
crowd
began
to
move
away
strong
had
intended
to
convey
the
stranger
into
sir
private
where
the
hats
of
the
male
guests
were
awaiting
them
and
having
there
soothed
his
friend
by
bland
conversation
to
have
carried
him
off
as
soon
as
the
cab
arrived
but
the
was
in
a
great
state
of
wrath
at
the
indignity
which
had
been
put
upon
him
and
when
strong
would
have
led
him
into
the
second
door
said
in
a
tipsy
voice
that
ai
the
door
that
the
door
where
the
drink
going
on
and
i
go
and
have
some
by
jove

and
have
at
this
audacity
the
butler
stood
aghast
in
the
hall
and
placed
himself
before
the
door
but
it
opened
behind
him
and
the
master
of
the
house
made
his
appearance
with
anxious
looks
i
will
have
some
by
i
will
the
intruder
was
roaring
out
as
sir
francis
came

the
very

and
no
the
host
reflected
a
moment
over
his
company
there
is
only
welbore
pendennis
and
those
two
lads
he
thought
and
with
a
forced
laugh
and
a
piteous
look
he
said
well
altamont
come
in
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
i
colonel
altamont
for
the
intelligent
reader
has
doubtless
long
ere
this
discovered
in
the
stranger
his
excellency
the
ambassador
of
the
nawaub
of
lucknow
reeled
into
the
with
a
triumphant
look
towards
jeames
the
footman
which
seemed
to
say
there
sir
what
do
you
think
of
that
now
am
i
a
gentleman
or
no
and
sank
down
into
the
first
vacant
chair
sir
francis
clavering
timidly
stammered
out
the
name
to
his
guest
welbore
welbore
and
his
excellency
began
drinking
wine
forthwith
and
gazing
round
upon
the
company
now
with
the
most
wonderful
frowns
and
anon
with
the
blandest
smiles
and
hiccupped
remarks
encomiastic
of
the
drink
which
he
was
imbibing
very
singular
man
has
resided
long
in
a
native
court
in
india
strong
said
with
great
gravity
the
chevalier
presence
of
mind
never
deserting
him
in
those
indian
courts
they
get
very
singular
very
said
major
pendennis
drily
and
wondering
what
in
name
was
the
company
into
which
he
had
got
foker
was
pleased
with
the
it
the
man
who
would
sing
the
malay
song
at
the
back
kitchen
he
whispered
to
pen
try
this
pine
sir
he
then
said
to
colonel
altamont
it
uncommonly
pines
i
seen
feed
pigs
on
pines
said
the
colonel
all
the
nawaub
of
lucknow
pigs
are
fed
on
pines
strong
whispered
to
major
pendennis
oh
of
course
the
major
answered
sir
francis
clavering
was
in
the
meanwhile
endeavouring
to
make
an
excuse
to
his
for
the
condition
and
muttered
something
regarding
altamont
that
he
was
an
extraordinary
character
very
eccentric
very
had
indian
habits
did
understand
the
rules
of
english
society
to
which
old
welbore
a
shrewd
old
gentleman
who
drank
his
wine
with
great
regularity
said
that
seemed
pretty
then
the
colonel
seeing
pen
honest
face
regarded
it
for
a
while
with
as
much
steadiness
as
became
his
condition
and
said
i
know
you
too
young
fellow
i
remember
you
baymouth
ball
by
jingo
wanted
to
fight
the
frenchman
i
remember
you
and
he
laughed
and
he
squared
with
his
fists
and
seemed
hugely
amused
in
the
drunken
depths
of
his
mind
as
these
recollections
passed
or
rather
reeled
across
it
mr
pendennis
you
remember
colonel
altamont
at
baymouth
strong
said
upon
which
pen
bowing
rather
stiffly
said
he
had
the
pleasure
of
remembering
that
circumstance
what
his
name
cried
the
colonel
strong
named
pendennis
again
pendennis
pendennis
be
hanged
altamont
roared
out
to
the
surprise
of
every
one
and
thumping
with
his
fist
on
the
table
my
name
is
also
pendennis
sir
said
the
major
whose
dignity
was
exceedingly
mortified
by
the
evening
events
that
he
major
pendennis
should
have
been
asked
to
such
a
party
and
that
a
drunken
man
should
have
been
introduced
to
it
my
name
is
pendennis
and
i
will
be
obliged
to
you
not
to
curse
it
too
the
tipsy
man
turned
round
to
look
at
him
and
as
he
looked
it
appeared
as
if
colonel
altamont
suddenly
grew
sober
he
put
his
hand
across
his
forehead
and
in
doing
so
displaced
somewhat
the
black
wig
which
he
wore
and
his
eyes
stared
fiercely
at
the
major
who
in
his
turn
like
a
resolute
old
warrior
as
he
was
looked
at
his
opponent
very
keenly
and
steadily
at
the
end
of
the
mutual
inspection
altamont
began
to
button
up
his
coat
and
rising
up
from
his
chair
suddenly
and
to
the
company
astonishment
reeled
towards
the
door
and
issued
from
it
followed
by
strong
all
that
the
latter
heard
him
utter
was
captain
beak
captain
beak
by
jingo
there
had
not
passed
above
a
quarter
of
an
hour
from
his
strange
appearance
to
his
equally
sudden
departure
the
two
young
men
and
the
baronet
other
guest
wondered
at
the
scene
and
could
find
no
explanation
for
it
clavering
seemed
exceedingly
pale
and
agitated
and
turned
with
looks
of
almost
terror
towards
major
pendennis
the
latter
had
been
eyeing
his
host
keenly
for
a
moment
or
two
do
you
know
him
asked
sir
francis
of
the
major
i
am
sure
i
have
seen
the
fellow
the
major
replied
looking
as
if
he
too
was
puzzled
yes
i
have
it
he
was
a
deserter
from
the
horse
artillery
who
got
into
the
nawaub
service
i
remember
his
face
quite
oh
said
clavering
with
a
sigh
which
indicated
immense
relief
of
mind
and
the
major
looked
at
him
with
a
twinkle
of
his
sharp
old
eyes
the
cab
which
strong
had
desired
to
be
called
drove
away
with
the
chevalier
and
colonel
altamont
coffee
was
brought
to
the
remaining
gentlemen
and
they
went
upstairs
to
the
ladies
in
the
foker
declaring
confidentially
to
pen
that
this
was
the
rummest
go
he
ever
saw
which
decision
pen
said
laughing
showed
great
discrimination
on
foker
then
according
to
her
promise
miss
amory
made
music
for
the
young
men
foker
was
enraptured
with
her
performance
and
kindly
joined
in
the
airs
which
she
sang
when
he
happened
to
be
acquainted
with
them
pen
affected
to
talk
aside
with
others
of
the
party
but
blanche
brought
him
quickly
to
the
piano
by
singing
some
of
his
own
words
those
which
we
have
given
in
a
previous
number
indeed
and
which
the
sylphide
had
herself
she
said
set
to
music
i
do
know
whether
the
air
was
hers
or
how
much
of
it
was
arranged
for
her
by
signor
twankidillo
from
whom
she
took
lessons
but
good
or
bad
original
or
otherwise
it
delighted
mr
pen
who
remained
by
her
side
and
turned
the
leaves
now
for
her
most
assiduously
gad
how
i
wish
i
could
write
verses
like
you
pen
foker
sighed
afterwards
to
his
companion
if
i
could
do
i
that
all
but
i
never
was
a
dab
at
writing
you
see
and
i
sorry
i
was
so
idle
when
i
was
at
no
mention
was
made
before
the
ladies
of
the
curious
little
scene
which
had
been
transacted
although
pen
was
just
on
the
point
of
describing
it
to
miss
amory
when
that
young
lady
inquired
for
captain
strong
who
she
wished
should
join
her
in
a
duet
but
chancing
to
look
up
towards
sir
francis
clavering
arthur
saw
a
peculiar
expression
of
alarm
in
the
baronet
ordinarily
vacuous
face
and
discreetly
held
his
tongue
it
was
rather
a
dull
evening
welbore
went
to
sleep
as
he
always
did
at
music
and
after
dinner
nor
did
major
pendennis
entertain
the
ladies
with
copious
anecdotes
and
endless
little
scandalous
stories
as
his
wont
was
but
sate
silent
for
the
most
part
and
appeared
to
be
listening
to
the
music
and
watching
the
fair
young
performer
the
hour
of
departure
having
arrived
the
major
rose
regretting
that
so
delightful
an
evening
should
have
passed
away
so
quickly
and
addressed
a
particularly
fine
compliment
to
miss
amory
upon
her
splendid
talents
as
a
singer
your
daughter
lady
clavering
he
said
to
that
lady
is
a
perfect
nightingale
a
perfect
nightingale
begad
i
have
scarcely
ever
heard
anything
equal
to
her
and
her
pronunciation
of
every
language
begad
of
every
language
seems
to
me
to
be
perfect
and
the
best
houses
in
london
must
open
before
a
young
lady
who
has
such
talents
and
allow
an
old
fellow
to
say
miss
amory
such
a
blanche
was
as
much
astonished
by
these
compliments
as
pen
was
to
whom
his
uncle
a
little
time
since
had
been
speaking
in
very
disparaging
terms
of
the
sylph
the
major
and
the
two
young
men
walked
home
together
after
foker
had
placed
his
mother
in
her
carriage
and
procured
a
light
for
an
enormous
cigar
the
young
gentleman
company
or
his
tobacco
did
not
appear
to
be
agreeable
to
major
pendennis
who
eyed
him
askance
several
times
and
with
a
look
which
plainly
indicated
that
he
wished
foker
would
take
his
leave
but
foker
hung
on
resolutely
to
the
uncle
and
nephew
even
until
they
came
to
the
former
door
in
bury
street
where
the
major
wished
the
lads
good
night
and
i
say
pen
he
said
in
a
confidential
whisper
calling
his
nephew
back
mind
you
make
a
point
of
calling
in
grosvenor
place
they
been
uncommonly
civil
civil
and
pen
promised
and
wondered
and
the
major
door
having
been
closed
upon
him
by
morgan
foker
took
pen
arm
and
walked
with
him
for
some
time
silently
puffing
his
cigar
at
last
when
they
had
reached
charing
cross
on
arthur
way
home
to
the
temple
harry
foker
relieved
himself
and
broke
out
with
that
eulogium
upon
poetry
and
those
regrets
regarding
a
misspent
youth
which
have
just
been
mentioned
and
all
the
way
along
the
strand
and
up
to
the
door
of
pen
very
staircase
in
lamb
court
temple
young
harry
foker
did
not
cease
to
speak
about
singing
and
blanche
amory
chapter
xl
relates
to
harry
foker
affairs
since
that
fatal
but
delightful
night
in
grosvenor
place
harry
foker
heart
had
been
in
such
a
state
of
agitation
as
you
would
hardly
have
thought
so
great
a
philosopher
could
endure
when
we
remember
what
good
advice
he
had
given
to
pen
in
former
days
how
an
early
wisdom
and
knowledge
of
the
world
had
manifested
itself
in
this
gifted
youth
how
a
constant
course
of
such
as
becomes
a
gentleman
of
his
means
and
expectations
ought
by
right
to
have
increased
his
cynicism
and
made
him
with
every
succeeding
day
of
his
life
care
less
and
less
for
every
individual
in
the
world
with
the
single
exception
of
harry
foker
one
may
wonder
that
he
should
fall
into
the
mishap
to
which
most
of
us
are
subject
once
or
twice
in
our
lives
and
disquiet
his
great
mind
about
a
woman
but
foker
though
early
wise
was
still
a
man
he
could
no
more
escape
the
common
lot
than
achilles
or
ajax
or
lord
nelson
or
adam
our
first
father
and
now
his
time
being
come
young
harry
became
a
victim
to
love
the
when
he
went
to
the
back
kitchen
that
night
after
quitting
arthur
pendennis
at
his
in
lamb
court
the
and
devilled
turkey
had
no
charms
for
him
the
jokes
of
his
companions
fell
flatly
on
his
ear
and
when
hodgen
the
singer
of
body
snatcher
had
a
new
chant
even
more
dreadful
and
humorous
than
that
famous
composition
foker
although
he
appeared
his
friend
and
said
bravo
hodgen
as
common
politeness
and
his
position
as
one
of
the
chiefs
of
the
back
kitchen
bound
him
to
do
yet
never
distinctly
heard
one
word
of
the
song
which
under
its
title
of
cat
in
the
cupboard
hodgen
has
since
rendered
so
famous
late
and
very
tired
he
slipped
into
his
private
apartments
at
home
and
sought
the
downy
pillow
but
his
slumbers
were
disturbed
by
the
fever
of
his
soul
and
the
very
instant
that
he
woke
from
his
agitated
sleep
the
image
of
miss
amory
presented
itself
to
him
and
said
here
i
am
i
am
your
princess
and
beauty
you
have
discovered
me
and
shall
care
for
nothing
else
heavens
how
stale
and
distasteful
his
former
pursuits
and
friendships
appeared
to
him
he
had
not
been
up
to
the
present
time
much
accustomed
to
the
society
of
females
of
his
own
rank
in
life
when
he
spoke
of
such
he
called
them
modest
that
virtue
which
let
us
hope
they
possessed
had
not
hitherto
compensated
to
foker
for
the
absence
of
more
lively
qualities
which
most
of
his
own
relatives
did
not
enjoy
and
which
he
found
in
mesdemoiselles
the
ladies
of
the
theatre
his
mother
though
good
and
tender
did
not
amuse
her
boy
his
cousins
the
daughters
of
his
maternal
uncle
the
respectable
earl
of
rosherville
wearied
him
beyond
measure
one
was
blue
and
a
geologist
one
was
a
horsewoman
and
smoked
cigars
one
was
exceedingly
low
church
and
had
the
most
heterodox
views
on
religious
matters
at
least
so
the
other
said
who
was
herself
of
the
very
highest
church
faction
and
made
the
cupboard
in
her
room
into
an
oratory
and
fasted
on
every
friday
in
the
year
their
paternal
house
of
drummington
foker
could
very
seldom
be
got
to
visit
he
swore
he
had
rather
go
on
the
treadmill
than
stay
there
he
was
not
much
beloved
by
the
inhabitants
lord
erith
lord
rosherville
heir
considered
his
cousin
a
low
person
of
deplorably
vulgar
habits
and
manners
while
foker
and
with
equal
reason
voted
erith
a
prig
and
a
dullard
the
nightcap
of
the
house
of
commons
the
speaker
opprobrium
the
dreariest
of
philanthropic
spouters
nor
could
george
robert
earl
of
gravesend
and
rosherville
ever
forget
that
on
one
evening
when
he
condescended
to
play
at
billiards
with
his
nephew
that
young
gentleman
poked
his
lordship
in
the
side
with
his
cue
and
said
well
old
cock
i
seen
many
a
bad
stroke
in
my
life
but
i
never
saw
such
a
bad
one
as
that
he
played
the
game
out
with
angelic
sweetness
of
temper
for
harry
was
his
guest
as
well
as
his
nephew
but
he
was
nearly
having
a
fit
in
the
night
and
he
kept
to
his
own
rooms
until
young
harry
quitted
drummington
on
his
return
to
oxbridge
where
the
interesting
youth
was
finishing
his
education
at
the
time
when
the
occurrence
took
place
it
was
an
awful
blow
to
the
venerable
earl
the
circumstance
was
never
alluded
to
in
the
family
he
shunned
foker
whenever
he
came
to
see
them
in
london
or
in
the
country
and
could
hardly
be
brought
to
gasp
out
a
how
d
do
to
the
young
blasphemer
but
he
would
not
break
his
sister
agnes
heart
by
banishing
harry
from
the
family
altogether
nor
indeed
could
he
afford
to
break
with
foker
senior
between
whom
and
his
lordship
there
had
been
many
private
transactions
producing
an
exchange
of
from
foker
and
autographs
from
the
earl
himself
with
the
letters
i
o
u
written
over
his
illustrious
signature
besides
the
four
daughters
of
lord
gravesend
whose
various
qualities
have
been
enumerated
in
the
former
paragraph
his
lordship
was
blessed
with
a
fifth
girl
the
lady
ana
milton
who
from
her
earliest
years
and
nursery
had
been
destined
to
a
peculiar
position
in
life
it
was
ordained
between
her
parents
and
her
aunt
that
when
mr
harry
foker
attained
a
proper
age
lady
ann
should
become
his
wife
the
idea
had
been
familiar
to
her
mind
when
she
yet
wore
pinafores
and
when
harry
the
dirtiest
of
little
boys
used
to
come
back
with
black
eyes
from
school
to
drummington
or
to
his
father
house
of
logwood
where
lady
ann
lived
much
with
her
aunt
both
of
the
young
people
coincided
with
the
arrangement
proposed
by
the
elders
without
any
protests
or
difficulty
it
no
more
entered
lady
ann
mind
to
question
the
order
of
her
father
than
it
would
have
entered
esther
to
dispute
the
commands
of
ahasuerus
the
of
the
house
of
foker
was
also
obedient
for
when
the
old
gentleman
said
harry
your
uncle
and
i
have
agreed
that
when
you
of
a
proper
age
you
marry
lady
ann
she
wo
have
any
money
but
she
good
blood
and
a
good
one
to
look
at
and
i
shall
make
you
comfortable
if
you
refuse
you
have
your
mother
jointure
and
two
hundred
a
year
during
my
life
harry
who
knew
that
his
sire
though
a
man
of
few
words
was
yet
implicitly
to
be
trusted
acquiesced
at
once
in
the
parental
decree
and
said
well
sir
if
agreeable
i
say
ditto
she
not
a
and
she
has
the
best
blood
in
england
sir
your
mother
blood
your
own
blood
sir
said
the
brewer
there
nothing
like
it
well
sir
as
you
like
it
harry
replied
when
you
want
me
please
ring
the
bell
only
there
no
hurry
and
i
hope
you
give
us
a
long
day
i
should
like
to
have
my
fling
out
before
i
fling
away
harry
answered
the
benevolent
father
nobody
prevents
you
do
they
and
so
very
little
more
was
said
upon
this
subject
and
harry
pursued
those
amusements
in
life
which
suited
him
best
and
hung
up
a
little
picture
of
his
cousin
in
his
amidst
the
french
prints
the
favourite
actresses
and
dancers
the
racing
and
coaching
works
of
art
which
suited
his
taste
and
formed
his
gallery
it
was
an
insignificant
little
picture
representing
a
simple
round
face
with
ringlets
and
it
made
as
it
must
be
confessed
a
very
poor
figure
by
the
side
of
mademoiselle
petitot
dancing
over
a
rainbow
or
mademoiselle
redowa
grinning
in
red
boots
and
a
lancer
cap
being
engaged
and
disposed
of
lady
ann
milton
did
not
go
out
so
much
in
the
world
as
her
sisters
and
often
stayed
at
home
in
london
at
the
parental
house
in
gaunt
square
when
her
mamma
with
the
other
ladies
went
abroad
they
talked
and
they
danced
with
one
man
after
another
and
the
men
came
and
went
and
the
stories
about
them
were
various
but
there
was
only
this
one
story
about
ann
she
was
engaged
to
harry
foker
she
never
was
to
think
about
anybody
else
it
was
not
a
very
amusing
story
well
the
instant
foker
awoke
on
the
day
after
lady
clavering
dinner
there
was
blanche
image
glaring
upon
him
with
its
clear
grey
eyes
and
winning
smile
there
was
her
tune
ringing
in
his
ears
yet
round
about
the
spot
ofttimes
i
hover
ofttimes
i
hover
which
poor
foker
began
piteously
to
hum
as
he
sat
up
in
his
bed
under
the
crimson
silken
coverlet
opposite
him
was
a
french
print
of
a
turkish
lady
and
her
greek
lover
surprised
by
a
venerable
ottoman
the
lady
husband
on
the
other
wall
was
a
french
print
of
a
gentleman
and
lady
riding
and
kissing
each
other
at
full
gallop
all
round
the
chaste
bedroom
were
more
french
prints
either
portraits
of
gauzy
nymphs
of
the
opera
or
lovely
illustrations
of
the
novels
or
mayhap
an
english
or
two
in
which
miss
calverley
of
would
be
represented
in
tight
pantaloons
in
her
favourite
page
part
or
miss
rougemont
as
venus
their
value
enhanced
by
the
signatures
of
these
ladies
maria
calverley
or
frederica
rougemont
inscribed
underneath
the
prints
in
an
exquisite
facsimile
such
were
the
pictures
in
which
honest
harry
delighted
he
was
no
worse
than
many
of
his
neighbours
he
was
an
idle
jovial
kindly
fast
man
about
town
and
if
his
rooms
were
rather
profusely
decorated
with
works
of
french
art
so
that
simple
lady
agnes
his
mamma
on
entering
the
apartments
where
her
darling
sate
enveloped
in
fragrant
clouds
of
latakia
was
often
bewildered
by
the
novelties
which
she
beheld
there
why
it
must
be
remembered
that
he
was
richer
than
most
young
men
and
could
better
afford
to
gratify
his
taste
a
letter
from
miss
calverley
written
in
a
very
degage
style
of
spelling
and
handwriting
scrawling
freely
over
the
filagree
paper
and
commencing
by
calling
harry
her
dear
lay
on
his
bed
table
by
his
side
amidst
keys
sovereigns
and
a
bit
of
verbena
which
miss
amory
had
given
him
and
reminding
him
of
the
arrival
of
the
day
when
he
was
stand
that
dinner
at
the
elefant
and
castle
at
richmond
which
he
had
promised
a
card
for
a
private
box
at
miss
rougemont
approaching
benefit
a
bundle
of
tickets
for
budgeon
night
the
north
lancashire
pippin
at
martin
faunce
the
hat
in
martin
lane
where
conkey
sam
dick
the
nailor
and
deadman
the
worcestershire
nobber
would
put
on
the
gloves
and
the
lovers
of
the
good
old
british
sport
were
invited
to
attend
these
and
sundry
other
memoirs
of
foker
pursuits
and
pleasure
lay
on
the
table
by
his
side
when
he
woke
ah
how
faint
all
these
pleasures
seemed
now
what
did
he
care
for
conkey
sam
or
the
worcestershire
nobber
what
for
the
french
prints
ogling
him
from
all
sides
of
the
room
those
regular
stunning
and
calverley
spelling
bad
and
calling
him
confound
her
impudence
the
idea
of
being
engaged
to
a
dinner
at
the
elephant
and
castle
at
richmond
with
that
old
woman
who
was
years
old
if
she
was
a
day
filled
his
mind
with
dreary
disgust
now
instead
of
that
pleasure
which
he
had
only
yesterday
expected
to
find
from
the
entertainment
when
his
fond
mamma
beheld
her
boy
that
morning
she
remarked
on
the
pallor
of
his
cheek
and
the
general
gloom
of
his
aspect
why
do
you
go
on
playing
billiards
at
that
wicked
spratt
lady
agnes
asked
my
dearest
child
those
billiards
will
kill
you
i
sure
they
it
is
the
billiards
harry
said
gloomily
then
it
the
dreadful
back
kitchen
said
the
lady
agnes
i
often
thought
know
harry
of
writing
to
the
landlady
and
begging
that
she
would
have
the
kindness
to
put
only
very
little
wine
in
the
negus
which
you
take
and
see
that
you
have
your
shawl
on
before
you
get
into
your
do
mrs
cutts
is
a
most
kind
motley
woman
harry
said
but
it
is
the
back
kitchen
neither
he
added
with
a
ghastly
sigh
as
lady
agnes
never
denied
her
son
anything
and
fell
into
all
his
ways
with
the
fondest
acquiescence
she
was
rewarded
by
a
perfect
confidence
on
young
harry
part
who
never
thought
to
disguise
from
her
a
knowledge
of
the
haunts
which
he
frequented
and
on
the
contrary
brought
her
home
choice
anecdotes
from
the
clubs
and
which
the
simple
lady
relished
if
she
did
not
understand
my
son
goes
to
spratt
she
would
say
to
her
confidential
friends
all
the
young
men
go
to
spratt
after
their
balls
it
is
de
rigueur
my
dear
and
they
play
billiards
as
they
used
to
play
macao
and
hazard
in
time
yes
my
dear
father
often
told
me
that
they
sate
up
always
until
nine
the
next
morning
with
fox
at
brookes
whom
i
remember
at
drnmmington
when
i
was
a
little
girl
in
a
buff
waistcoat
and
black
satin
my
brother
erith
never
played
as
a
young
man
nor
sate
up
late
he
had
no
health
for
it
but
my
boy
must
do
as
everybody
does
you
know
yes
and
then
he
often
goes
to
a
place
called
the
back
kitchen
frequented
by
all
the
wits
and
authors
you
know
whom
one
does
not
see
in
society
but
whom
it
is
a
great
privilege
and
pleasure
for
harry
to
meet
and
there
he
hears
the
questions
of
the
day
discussed
and
my
dear
father
often
said
that
it
was
our
duty
to
encourage
literature
and
he
had
hoped
to
see
the
late
johnson
at
drummington
only
johnson
died
yes
and
sheridan
came
over
and
drank
a
great
deal
of
wine
everybody
drank
a
great
deal
of
wine
in
those
days
and
papa
bill
was
ten
times
as
much
as
is
who
gets
it
as
he
wants
it
from
fortnum
and
mason
and
does
keep
any
stock
at
that
was
an
uncommon
good
dinner
we
had
yesterday
the
artful
harry
broke
out
their
clear
soup
better
than
ours
moufflet
will
put
too
much
taragon
into
everything
the
supreme
de
volaille
was
very
good
uncommon
and
the
sweets
were
better
than
moufflet
sweets
did
you
taste
the
plombiere
and
the
maraschino
jelly
stunningly
good
that
maraschino
jelly
lady
agnes
expressed
her
agreement
in
these
as
in
almost
all
other
sentiments
of
her
son
who
continued
the
artful
conversation
saying
very
handsome
house
that
of
the
claverings
furniture
i
should
say
got
up
regardless
of
expense
magnificent
display
of
plate
the
lady
assented
to
all
these
propositions
very
nice
people
the
h
said
lady
agnes
i
know
what
you
mean
lady
ai
distangy
exactly
but
she
is
very
oh
very
mamma
said
who
was
herself
one
of
the
most
of
women
and
sir
francis
he
do
talk
much
before
ladies
but
after
dinner
he
comes
out
uncommon
strong
a
highly
agreeable
man
when
will
you
ask
them
to
dinner
look
out
for
an
early
day
and
looking
into
lady
agnes
he
chose
a
day
only
a
fortnight
hence
an
age
that
fortnight
seemed
to
the
young
gentleman
when
the
claverings
were
to
be
invited
to
the
obedient
lady
agnes
wrote
the
required
invitation
she
was
accustomed
to
do
so
without
consulting
her
husband
who
had
his
own
society
and
habits
and
who
left
his
wife
to
see
her
own
friends
alone
harry
looked
at
the
card
but
there
was
an
omission
in
the
invitation
which
did
not
please
him
you
have
not
asked
miss
whatdyecallem
miss
emery
lady
oh
that
little
creature
lady
agnes
cried
no
i
think
not
we
must
ask
miss
amory
foker
said
i
i
want
to
ask
pendennis
and
and
he
very
sweet
upon
her
do
you
think
she
sings
very
well
i
thought
her
rather
forward
and
did
listen
to
her
singing
she
only
sang
at
you
and
pendennis
it
seemed
to
me
but
i
will
ask
her
if
you
wish
harry
and
so
miss
amory
name
was
written
on
the
card
with
her
mother
this
piece
of
diplomacy
being
triumphantly
executed
harry
embraced
his
fond
parent
with
the
utmost
affection
and
retired
to
his
own
apartments
where
he
stretched
himself
on
his
ottoman
and
lay
brooding
silently
sighing
for
the
day
which
was
to
bring
the
fair
miss
amory
under
his
paternal
roof
and
devising
a
hundred
wild
schemes
for
meeting
her
on
his
return
from
making
the
grand
tour
foker
junior
had
brought
with
him
a
polyglot
valet
who
took
the
place
of
stoopid
and
condescended
to
wait
at
dinner
attired
in
shirt
fronts
of
worked
muslin
with
many
gold
studs
and
chains
upon
his
master
and
the
elders
of
the
family
this
man
who
was
of
no
particular
country
and
spoke
all
languages
indifferently
ill
made
himself
useful
to
harry
in
a
variety
of
ways
read
all
the
artless
youth
correspondence
knew
his
favourite
haunts
and
the
addresses
of
his
acquaintance
and
officiated
at
the
private
dinners
which
the
young
gentleman
gave
as
harry
lay
upon
his
sofa
after
his
interview
with
his
mamma
robed
in
a
wonderful
and
puffing
his
pipe
in
gloomy
silence
anatole
too
must
have
remarked
that
something
affected
his
master
spirits
though
he
did
not
betray
any
sympathy
with
harry
agitation
of
mind
when
harry
began
to
dress
himself
in
his
morning
costume
he
was
very
hard
indeed
to
please
and
particularly
severe
and
snappish
about
his
toilet
he
tried
and
cursed
pantaloons
of
many
different
stripes
checks
and
colours
all
the
boots
were
villainously
varnished
the
shirts
too
loud
in
pattern
he
scented
his
linen
and
person
with
peculiar
richness
this
day
and
what
must
have
been
the
astonishment
when
after
some
blushing
and
hesitation
on
harry
part
the
young
gentleman
asked
i
say
anatole
when
i
engaged
you
you
hem
did
you
say
that
you
could
dress
hem
dress
hair
the
valet
said
yes
he
cherchy
alors
une
paire
de
tongs
et
curly
moi
un
peu
foker
said
in
an
easy
manner
and
the
valet
wondering
whether
his
master
was
in
love
or
was
going
masquerading
went
in
search
of
the
articles
first
from
the
old
butler
who
waited
upon
foker
senior
on
whose
bald
pate
the
tongs
would
have
scarcely
found
a
hundred
hairs
to
seize
and
finally
of
the
lady
who
had
the
charge
of
the
meek
auburn
fronts
of
the
lady
agnes
and
the
tongs
being
got
monsieur
anatole
twisted
his
young
master
locks
until
he
had
made
harry
head
as
curly
as
a
negro
after
which
the
youth
dressed
himself
with
the
utmost
care
and
splendour
and
proceeded
to
sally
out
at
what
dime
sall
i
order
de
drag
sir
to
be
to
miss
calverley
door
sir
the
attendant
whispered
as
his
master
was
going
forth
confound
her
put
the
dinner
off
i
ca
go
said
foker
no
hang
it
i
must
go
poyntz
and
rougemont
and
ever
so
many
more
are
coming
the
drag
at
pelham
corner
at
six
the
drag
was
not
one
of
foker
own
equipages
but
was
hired
from
a
for
festive
purposes
foker
however
put
his
own
carriage
into
requisition
that
morning
and
for
what
purpose
does
the
kind
reader
suppose
why
to
drive
down
to
lamb
court
temple
taking
grosvenor
place
by
the
way
which
lies
in
the
exact
direction
of
the
temple
from
grosvenor
street
as
everybody
knows
where
he
just
had
the
pleasure
of
peeping
upwards
at
miss
amory
pink
having
achieved
which
satisfactory
feat
he
drove
off
to
pen
chambers
why
did
he
want
to
see
his
dear
friend
pen
so
much
why
did
he
yearn
and
long
after
him
and
did
it
seem
necessary
to
foker
very
existence
that
he
should
see
pen
that
morning
having
parted
with
him
in
perfect
health
on
the
night
previous
pen
had
lived
two
years
in
london
and
foker
had
not
paid
half
a
dozen
visits
to
his
chambers
what
sent
him
thither
now
in
such
a
hurry
what
if
any
young
ladies
read
this
page
i
have
only
to
inform
them
that
when
the
same
mishap
befalls
them
which
now
had
for
more
than
twelve
hours
befallen
harry
foker
people
will
grow
interesting
to
them
for
whom
they
did
not
care
sixpence
on
the
day
before
as
on
the
other
hand
persons
of
whom
they
fancied
themselves
fond
will
be
found
to
have
become
insipid
and
disagreeable
then
you
dearest
eliza
or
maria
of
the
other
day
to
whom
you
wrote
letters
and
sent
locks
of
hair
yards
long
will
on
a
sudden
be
as
indifferent
to
you
as
your
stupidest
relation
whilst
on
the
contrary
about
his
relations
you
will
begin
to
feel
such
a
warm
interest
such
a
loving
desire
to
ingratiate
yourself
with
his
mamma
such
a
liking
for
that
dear
kind
old
man
his
father
if
he
is
in
the
habit
of
visiting
at
any
house
what
advances
you
will
make
in
order
to
visit
there
too
if
he
has
a
married
sister
you
will
like
to
spend
long
mornings
with
her
you
will
fatigue
your
servant
by
sending
notes
to
her
for
which
there
will
be
the
most
pressing
occasion
twice
or
thrice
in
a
day
you
will
cry
if
your
mamma
objects
to
your
going
too
often
to
see
his
family
the
only
one
of
them
you
will
dislike
is
perhaps
his
younger
brother
who
is
at
home
for
the
holidays
and
who
will
persist
in
staying
in
the
room
when
you
come
to
see
your
dear
friend
his
darling
second
sister
something
like
this
will
happen
to
you
young
ladies
or
at
any
rate
let
us
hope
it
may
yes
you
must
go
through
the
hot
fits
and
the
cold
fits
of
that
pretty
fever
your
mothers
if
they
would
acknowledge
it
have
passed
through
it
before
you
were
born
your
dear
papa
being
the
object
of
the
passion
of
course
who
could
it
be
but
he
and
as
you
suffer
it
so
will
your
brothers
in
their
way
and
after
their
kind
more
selfish
than
you
more
eager
and
headstrong
than
you
they
will
rush
on
their
destiny
when
the
doomed
charmer
makes
her
appearance
or
if
they
do
and
you
do
heaven
help
you
as
the
gambler
said
of
his
dice
to
love
and
win
is
the
best
thing
to
love
and
lose
is
the
next
best
you
do
die
of
the
complaint
or
very
few
do
the
generous
wounded
heart
suffers
and
survives
it
and
he
is
not
a
man
or
she
a
woman
who
is
not
conquered
by
it
or
who
does
not
conquer
it
in
his
now
then
if
you
ask
why
henry
foker
esquire
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
see
arthur
pendennis
and
felt
such
a
sudden
value
and
esteem
for
him
there
is
no
difficulty
in
saying
it
was
because
pen
had
become
really
valuable
in
eyes
because
if
pen
was
not
the
rose
he
yet
had
been
near
that
fragrant
flower
of
love
was
not
he
in
the
habit
of
going
to
her
house
in
london
did
he
not
live
near
her
in
the
country
know
all
about
the
enchantress
what
i
wonder
would
lady
ann
milton
foker
cousin
and
pretendue
have
said
if
her
ladyship
had
known
all
that
was
going
on
in
the
bosom
of
that
funny
little
gentleman
alas
when
foker
reached
lamb
court
leaving
his
carriage
for
the
admiration
of
the
little
clerks
who
were
lounging
in
the
archway
that
leads
thence
into
flag
court
which
leads
into
upper
temple
lane
warrington
was
in
the
chambers
but
pen
was
absent
pen
was
gone
to
the
to
see
his
proofs
would
foker
have
a
pipe
and
should
the
laundress
go
to
the
cock
and
get
him
some
beer
warrington
asked
remarking
with
a
pleased
surprise
the
splendid
toilet
of
this
scented
and
young
aristocrat
but
foker
had
not
the
slightest
wish
for
beer
or
tobacco
he
had
very
important
business
he
rushed
away
to
the
pall
mall
gazette
office
still
bent
upon
finding
pen
pen
had
quitted
that
pace
foker
wanted
him
that
they
might
go
together
to
call
upon
lady
clavering
foker
went
away
disconsolate
and
whiled
away
an
hour
or
two
vaguely
at
clubs
and
when
it
was
time
to
pay
a
visit
he
thought
it
would
be
but
decent
and
polite
to
drive
to
grosvenor
place
and
leave
a
card
upon
lady
clavering
he
had
not
the
courage
to
ask
to
see
her
when
the
door
was
opened
he
only
delivered
two
cards
with
henry
foker
engraved
upon
them
to
jeames
in
a
speechless
agony
jeames
received
the
tickets
bowing
his
powdered
head
the
varnished
doors
closed
upon
him
the
beloved
object
was
as
far
as
ever
from
him
though
so
near
he
thought
he
heard
the
tones
of
a
piano
and
of
a
syren
singing
coming
from
the
and
sweeping
over
the
of
geraniums
he
would
have
liked
to
stop
and
listen
but
it
might
not
be
drive
to
tattersall
he
said
to
the
groom
in
a
voice
smothered
with
emotion
and
bring
my
pony
round
he
added
as
the
man
drove
rapidly
away
as
good
luck
would
have
it
that
splendid
barouche
of
lady
clavering
which
has
been
inadequately
described
in
a
former
chapter
drove
up
to
her
ladyship
door
just
as
foker
mounted
the
pony
which
was
in
waiting
for
him
he
bestrode
the
fiery
animal
and
dodged
about
the
arch
of
the
green
park
keeping
the
carriage
well
in
view
until
he
saw
lady
clavering
enter
and
with
her
whose
could
be
that
angel
form
but
the
enchantress
clad
in
a
sort
of
gossamer
with
a
pink
bonnet
and
a
parasol
but
miss
amory
the
carriage
took
its
fair
owners
to
madame
rigodon
cap
and
lace
shop
to
mrs
wolsey
berlin
worsted
shop
who
knows
to
what
other
resorts
of
female
commerce
then
it
went
and
took
ices
at
hunter
for
lady
clavering
was
somewhat
florid
in
her
tastes
and
amusements
and
not
only
liked
to
go
abroad
in
the
most
showy
carriage
in
london
but
that
the
public
should
see
her
in
it
too
and
so
in
a
white
bonnet
with
a
yellow
feather
she
ate
a
large
pink
ice
in
the
sunshine
before
hunter
door
till
foker
on
his
pony
and
the
red
jacket
who
accompanied
him
were
almost
tired
of
dodging
then
at
last
she
made
her
way
into
the
park
and
the
rapid
foker
made
his
dash
forward
what
to
do
just
to
get
a
nod
of
recognition
from
miss
amory
and
her
mother
to
cross
them
a
times
in
the
drive
to
watch
and
ogle
them
from
the
other
side
of
the
ditch
where
the
horsemen
assemble
when
the
band
plays
in
kensington
gardens
what
is
the
use
of
looking
at
a
woman
in
a
pink
bonnet
across
a
ditch
what
is
the
earthly
good
to
be
got
out
of
a
nod
of
the
head
strange
that
men
will
be
contented
with
such
pleasures
or
if
not
contented
at
least
that
they
will
be
so
eager
in
seeking
them
not
one
word
did
harry
he
so
fluent
of
conversation
ordinarily
change
with
his
charmer
on
that
day
mutely
he
beheld
her
return
to
her
carriage
and
drive
away
among
rather
ironical
salutes
from
the
young
men
in
the
park
one
said
that
the
indian
widow
was
making
the
paternal
rupees
spin
rapidly
another
said
that
she
ought
to
have
burned
herself
alive
and
left
the
money
to
her
daughter
this
one
asked
who
clavering
was
and
old
tom
eales
who
knew
everybody
and
never
missed
a
day
in
the
park
on
his
grey
cob
kindly
said
that
clavering
had
come
into
an
estate
over
head
and
heels
in
mortgage
that
there
were
ugly
stories
about
him
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
that
it
was
reported
of
him
that
he
had
a
share
in
a
and
had
certainly
shown
the
white
feather
in
his
regiment
he
plays
still
he
is
in
a
hell
every
night
almost
eales
added
i
should
think
so
since
his
marriage
said
a
wag
he
gives
devilish
good
dinners
said
foker
striking
up
for
the
honour
of
his
host
of
yesterday
i
daresay
and
i
daresay
he
does
ask
eales
the
wag
said
i
say
eales
do
you
dine
at
clavering
at
the
begum
i
dine
there
said
eales
who
would
have
dined
with
beelzebub
if
sure
of
a
good
cook
and
when
he
came
away
would
have
painted
his
host
blacker
than
fate
had
made
him
you
might
you
know
although
you
do
abuse
him
so
continued
the
wag
they
say
it
very
pleasant
clavering
goes
to
sleep
after
dinner
the
begum
gets
tipsy
with
and
the
young
lady
sings
songs
to
the
young
gentlemen
she
sings
well
do
she
fo
slap
up
said
fo
i
tell
you
what
poyntz
she
sings
like
a
whatdyecallum
you
know
what
i
mean
like
a
mermaid
you
know
but
that
not
their
i
never
heard
a
mermaid
sing
poyntz
the
wag
replied
whoever
heard
a
mermaid
eales
you
are
an
old
fellow
did
you
do
make
a
lark
of
me
hang
it
poyntz
said
foker
turning
red
and
with
tears
almost
in
his
eyes
you
know
what
i
mean
it
those
in
homer
you
know
i
never
said
i
was
a
good
and
nobody
ever
said
it
of
you
my
boy
poyntz
remarked
and
foker
striking
spurs
into
his
pony
cantered
away
down
rotten
row
his
mind
agitated
with
various
emotions
ambitions
mortifications
he
was
sorry
that
he
had
not
been
good
at
his
books
in
early
life
that
he
might
have
cut
out
all
those
chaps
who
were
about
her
and
who
talked
the
languages
and
wrote
poetry
and
painted
pictures
in
her
album
and
and
that
what
am
i
thought
little
foker
compared
to
her
she
all
soul
she
is
and
can
write
poetry
or
compose
music
as
easy
as
i
could
drink
a
glass
of
beer
beer
damme
that
all
i
fit
for
is
beer
i
am
a
poor
ignorant
little
beggar
good
for
nothing
but
foker
entire
i
misspent
my
youth
and
used
to
get
the
chaps
to
do
my
exercises
and
what
the
consequences
now
oh
harry
foker
what
a
confounded
little
fool
you
have
been
as
he
made
this
dreary
soliloquy
he
had
cantered
out
of
rotten
row
into
the
park
and
there
was
on
the
point
of
riding
down
a
large
old
roomy
family
carriage
of
which
he
took
no
heed
when
a
cheery
voice
cried
out
harry
harry
and
looking
up
he
beheld
his
aunt
the
lady
rosherville
and
two
of
her
daughters
of
whom
the
one
who
spoke
was
harry
betrothed
the
lady
ann
he
started
back
with
a
pale
scared
look
as
a
truth
about
which
he
had
not
thought
during
the
whole
day
came
across
him
there
was
his
fate
there
in
the
back
seat
of
that
carriage
what
is
the
matter
harry
why
are
you
so
pale
you
have
been
raking
and
smoking
too
much
you
wicked
boy
said
lady
ann
foker
said
how
do
aunt
how
do
ann
in
a
perturbed
manner
muttered
something
about
a
pressing
engagement
indeed
he
saw
by
the
park
clock
that
he
must
have
been
keeping
his
party
in
the
drag
waiting
for
nearly
an
hour
and
waved
a
the
little
man
and
the
little
pony
were
out
of
sight
in
an
instant
the
great
carriage
rolled
away
nobody
inside
was
very
much
interested
about
his
coming
or
going
the
countess
being
occupied
with
her
spaniel
the
lady
lucy
thoughts
and
eyes
being
turned
upon
a
volume
of
sermons
and
those
of
the
lady
ann
upon
a
new
novel
which
the
sisters
had
just
procured
from
the
library
chapter
xli
carries
the
reader
both
to
richmond
and
greenwich
poor
foker
found
the
dinner
at
richmond
to
be
the
most
dreary
entertainment
upon
which
ever
mortal
man
wasted
his
guineas
i
wonder
how
the
deuce
i
could
ever
have
liked
these
people
he
thought
in
his
own
mind
why
i
can
see
the
under
rougemont
eyes
and
the
paint
on
her
cheeks
is
laid
on
as
thick
as
clown
in
a
pantomime
the
way
in
which
that
calverley
talks
slang
is
quite
disgusting
i
hate
chaff
in
a
woman
and
old
colchicum
that
old

down
here
in
his
brougham
with
his

will
not
do
for
your
thoughts
fokey
cried
out
miss
rougemont
taking
her
cigar
from
her
truly
vermilion
lips
as
she
beheld
the
young
fellow
lost
in
thought
seated
at
the
head
of
his
table
amidst
melting
ices
and
cut
pineapples
and
bottles
full
and
empty
and
scattered
on
fruit
and
the
ruins
of
a
dessert
which
had
no
pleasure
for
him

foker
ever
think

here

a
considerable
sum
of
money

at

emanations
of
your
valuable
and
acute
intellect
old

what
the

is
that
poyntz
a

of

a

sneerin
what
a
droll
of
a
little
man
is
that
little
fokare
my
lor
mademoiselle
coralie
said
in
her
own
language
and
with
the
rich
twang
of
that
sunny
gascony
in
which
her
swarthy
cheeks
and
bright
black
eyes
had
got
their
fire
what
a
droll
of
a
man
he
does
not
look
to
have
twenty
i
wish
i
were
of
his
age
said
the
venerable
colchicum
with
a
sigh
as
he
inclined
his
purple
face
towards
a
large
goblet
of
claret
jeunesse
peuh

with
a
grin

madame

coralie
cried
with
a
shrug
of
her
robust
shoulders
upon
which
my
lord
said
that
she
did
not
flatter
at
any
rate
and
pocketed
his
not
desirous
that
madame
brack
dubious
fingers
should
plunge
too
frequently
into
his
mackabaw
there
is
no
need
to
give
a
prolonged
detail
of
the
animated
conversation
which
ensued
during
the
rest
of
the
banquet
a
conversation
which
would
not
much
edify
the
reader
and
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
that
all
ladies
of
the
corps
de
dance
are
not
like
miss
calverley
any
more
than
that
all
peers
resemble
that
illustrious
member
of
their
order
the
late
lamented
viscount
colchicum
but
there
have
been
such
in
our
memories
who
have
loved
the
society
of
riotous
youth
better
than
the
company
of
men
of
their
own
age
and
rank
and
have
given
the
young
ones
the
precious
benefit
of
their
experience
and
example
and
there
have
been
very
respectable
men
too
who
have
not
objected
so
much
to
the
kind
of
entertainment
as
to
the
publicity
of
it
i
am
sure
for
instance
that
our
friend
major
pendennis
would
have
made
no
sort
of
objection
to
join
a
party
of
pleasure
provided
that
it
were
en
petit
comite
and
that
such
men
as
my
lord
steyne
and
my
lord
colchicum
were
of
the
society
give
the
young
men
their
pleasures
this
worthy
guardian
said
to
pen
more
than
once
i
not
one
of
your
moralists
but
an
old
man
of
the
world
begad
and
i
know
that
as
long
as
it
lasts
young
men
will
be
young
and
there
were
some
young
men
to
whom
this
estimable
philosopher
accorded
about
seventy
years
as
the
proper
period
for
sowing
their
wild
oats
but
they
were
men
of
fashion
foker
drove
his
lovely
guests
home
to
brompton
in
the
drag
that
night
but
he
was
quite
thoughtful
and
gloomy
during
the
whole
of
the
little
journey
from
richmond
neither
listening
to
the
jokes
of
the
friends
behind
him
and
on
the
box
by
his
side
nor
enlivening
them
as
was
his
wont
by
his
own
facetious
sallies
and
when
the
ladies
whom
he
had
conveyed
alighted
at
the
door
of
their
house
and
asked
their
accomplished
coachman
whether
he
would
not
step
in
and
take
something
to
drink
he
declined
with
so
melancholy
an
air
that
they
supposed
that
the
governor
and
he
had
had
a
difference
or
that
some
calamity
had
befallen
him
and
he
did
not
tell
these
people
what
the
cause
of
his
grief
was
but
left
mesdames
rougemont
and
calverley
unheeding
the
cries
of
the
latter
who
hung
over
her
balcony
like
jezebel
and
called
out
to
him
to
ask
him
to
give
another
party
soon
he
sent
the
drag
home
under
the
guidance
of
one
of
the
grooms
and
went
on
foot
himself
his
hands
in
his
pockets
plunged
in
thought
the
stars
and
moon
shining
tranquilly
overhead
looked
down
upon
foker
that
night
as
he
in
his
turn
sentimentally
regarded
them
and
he
went
and
gazed
upwards
at
the
house
in
grosvenor
place
and
at
the
windows
which
he
supposed
to
be
those
of
the
beloved
object
and
he
moaned
and
he
sighed
in
a
way
piteous
and
surprising
to
witness
which
policeman
x
did
who
informed
sir
francis
clavering
people
as
they
took
the
refreshment
of
beer
on
the
at
the
neighbouring
after
bringing
home
their
lady
from
the
french
play
that
there
had
been
another
chap
hanging
about
the
premises
that
evening
a
little
chap
dressed
like
a
swell
and
now
with
that
perspicuity
and
ingenuity
and
enterprise
which
only
belongs
to
a
certain
passion
foker
began
to
dodge
miss
amory
through
london
and
to
appear
wherever
he
could
meet
her
if
lady
clavering
went
to
the
french
play
where
her
ladyship
had
a
box
foker
whose
knowledge
of
the
language
as
we
have
heard
was
not
conspicuous
appeared
in
a
stall
he
found
out
where
her
engagements
were
it
is
possible
that
anatole
his
man
was
acquainted
with
sir
francis
clavering
gentleman
and
so
got
a
sight
of
her
and
at
many
of
these
evening
parties
foker
made
his
appearance
to
the
surprise
of
the
world
and
of
his
mother
especially
whom
he
ordered
to
apply
for
cards
to
these
parties
for
which
until
now
he
had
shown
a
supreme
contempt
he
told
the
pleased
and
unsuspicious
lady
that
he
went
to
parties
because
it
was
right
for
him
to
see
the
world
he
told
her
that
he
went
to
the
french
play
because
he
wanted
to
perfect
himself
in
the
language
and
there
was
no
such
good
lesson
as
a
comedy
or
vaudeville
and
when
one
night
the
astonished
lady
agnes
saw
him
stand
up
and
dance
and
complimented
him
upon
his
elegance
and
activity
the
mendacious
little
rogue
asserted
that
he
had
learned
to
dance
in
paris
whereas
anatole
knew
that
his
young
master
used
to
go
off
privily
to
an
academy
in
brewer
street
and
study
there
for
some
hours
in
the
morning
the
casino
of
our
modern
days
was
not
invented
or
was
in
its
infancy
as
yet
and
gentlemen
of
time
had
not
the
facilities
of
acquiring
the
science
of
dancing
which
are
enjoyed
by
our
present
youth
old
pendennis
seldom
missed
going
to
church
he
considered
it
to
be
his
duty
as
a
gentleman
to
patronise
the
institution
of
public
worship
and
that
it
was
quite
a
correct
thing
to
be
seen
at
church
of
a
sunday
one
day
it
chanced
that
he
and
arthur
went
thither
together
the
latter
who
was
now
in
high
favour
had
been
to
breakfast
with
his
uncle
from
whose
lodging
they
walked
across
the
park
to
a
church
not
far
from
belgrave
square
there
was
a
charity
sermon
at
saint
james
as
the
major
knew
by
the
bills
posted
on
the
pillars
of
his
parish
church
which
probably
caused
him
for
he
was
a
thrifty
man
to
forsake
it
for
that
day
besides
he
had
other
views
for
himself
and
pen
we
will
go
to
church
sir
across
the
park
and
then
begad
we
will
go
to
the
house
and
ask
them
for
lunch
in
a
friendly
way
lady
clavering
likes
to
be
asked
for
lunch
and
is
uncommonly
kind
and
monstrous
i
met
them
at
dinner
last
week
at
lady
agnes
foker
sir
pen
said
and
the
begum
was
very
kind
indeed
so
she
was
in
the
country
so
she
is
everywhere
but
i
share
your
opinion
about
miss
amory
one
of
your
opinions
that
is
uncle
for
you
were
changing
the
last
time
we
spoke
about
and
what
do
you
think
of
her
now
the
elder
said
i
think
her
the
most
confounded
little
flirt
in
london
pen
answered
laughing
she
made
a
tremendous
assault
upon
harry
foker
who
sat
next
to
her
and
to
whom
she
gave
all
the
talk
though
i
took
her
bah
henry
foker
is
engaged
to
his
cousin
all
the
world
knows
it
not
a
bad
coup
of
lady
rosherville
that
i
should
say
that
the
young
man
at
his
father
death
and
old
foker
life
devilish
bad
you
know
he
had
a
fit
at
arthur
last
year
i
should
say
that
young
foker
have
less
than
fourteen
thousand
a
year
from
the
brewery
besides
logwood
and
norfolk
property
i
no
pride
about
me
pen
i
like
a
man
of
birth
certainly
but
dammy
i
like
a
brewery
which
brings
in
a
man
fourteen
thousand
a
year
hey
pen
ha
ha
that
the
sort
of
man
for
me
and
i
recommend
you
now
that
you
are
lanced
in
the
world
to
stick
to
fellows
of
that
sort
to
fellows
who
have
a
stake
in
the
country
foker
sticks
to
me
sir
arthur
answered
he
has
been
at
our
chambers
several
times
lately
he
has
asked
me
to
dinner
we
are
almost
as
great
friends
as
we
used
to
be
in
our
youth
and
his
talk
is
about
blanche
amory
from
morning
till
night
i
sure
he
sweet
upon
i
sure
he
is
engaged
to
his
cousin
and
that
they
will
keep
the
young
man
to
his
bargain
said
the
major
the
marriages
in
these
families
are
affairs
of
state
lady
agnes
was
made
to
marry
old
foker
by
the
late
lord
although
she
was
notoriously
partial
to
her
cousin
who
was
killed
at
albuera
afterwards
and
who
saved
her
life
out
of
the
lake
at
drummington
i
remember
lady
agnes
sir
an
exceedingly
fine
woman
but
what
did
she
do
of
course
she
married
her
father
man
why
foker
sate
for
drummington
till
the
reform
bill
and
paid
well
for
his
seat
too
and
you
may
depend
upon
this
sir
that
foker
senior
who
is
a
parvenu
and
loves
a
great
man
as
all
parvenus
do
has
ambitious
views
for
his
son
as
well
as
himself
and
that
your
friend
harry
must
do
as
his
father
bids
him
lord
bless
you
i
known
a
hundred
cases
of
love
in
young
men
and
women
hey
master
arthur
do
you
take
me
they
kick
sir
they
resist
they
make
a
deuce
of
a
riot
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
they
end
by
listening
to
reason
blanche
is
a
dangerous
girl
sir
pen
said
i
was
smitten
with
her
myself
once
and
very
far
gone
too
he
added
but
that
is
years
were
you
how
far
did
it
go
did
she
return
it
asked
the
major
looking
hard
at
pen
pen
with
a
laugh
said
that
at
one
time
he
did
think
he
was
pretty
well
in
miss
amory
good
graces
but
my
mother
did
not
like
her
and
the
affair
went
pen
did
not
think
it
fit
to
tell
his
uncle
all
the
particulars
of
that
courtship
which
had
passed
between
himself
and
the
young
lady
a
man
might
go
farther
and
fare
worse
arthur
the
major
said
still
looking
queerly
at
his
nephew
her
birth
sir
her
father
was
the
mate
of
a
ship
they
say
and
she
has
not
money
enough
objected
pen
in
a
dandified
manner
what
ten
thousand
pound
and
a
girl
bred
up
like
her
you
use
my
own
words
and
it
is
all
very
well
but
i
tell
you
in
confidence
pen
in
strict
honour
mind
that
it
my
belief
she
has
a
devilish
deal
more
than
ten
thousand
pound
and
from
what
i
saw
of
her
the
other
day
and
and
have
heard
of
her
i
should
say
she
was
a
devilish
accomplished
clever
girl
and
would
make
a
good
wife
with
a
sensible
how
do
you
know
about
her
money
pen
asked
smiling
you
seem
to
have
information
about
everybody
and
to
know
about
all
the
i
do
know
a
few
things
sir
and
i
do
tell
all
i
know
mark
that
the
uncle
replied
and
as
for
that
charming
miss
amory
for
charming
begad
she
is
if
i
saw
her
arthur
pendennis
i
should
neither
be
sorry
nor
surprised
begad
and
if
you
object
to
ten
thousand
pound
what
would
you
say
sir
to
thirty
or
forty
or
fifty
and
the
major
looked
still
more
knowingly
and
still
harder
at
pen
well
sir
he
said
to
his
godfather
and
namesake
make
her
arthur
pendennis
you
can
do
it
as
well
as
psha
you
are
laughing
at
me
sir
the
other
replied
rather
peevishly
and
you
ought
not
to
laugh
so
near
a
church
gate
here
we
are
at
benedict
they
say
oriel
is
a
beautiful
indeed
the
bells
were
tolling
the
people
were
trooping
into
the
handsome
church
the
carriages
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
lordly
quarter
poured
forth
their
pretty
loads
of
devotees
in
whose
company
pen
and
his
uncle
ending
their
edifying
conversation
entered
the
fane
i
do
not
know
whether
other
people
carry
their
worldly
affairs
to
the
church
door
arthur
who
from
habitual
reverence
and
feeling
was
always
more
than
respectful
in
a
place
of
worship
thought
of
the
incongruity
of
their
talk
perhaps
whilst
the
old
gentleman
at
his
side
was
utterly
unconscious
of
any
such
contrast
his
hat
was
brushed
his
wig
was
trim
his
neckcloth
was
perfectly
tied
he
looked
at
every
soul
in
the
congregation
it
is
true
the
bald
heads
and
the
bonnets
the
flowers
and
the
feathers
but
so
demurely
that
he
hardly
lifted
up
his
eyes
from
his
book
from
his
book
which
he
could
not
read
without
glasses
as
for
pen
gravity
it
was
sorely
put
to
the
test
when
upon
looking
by
chance
towards
the
seats
where
the
servants
were
collected
he
spied
out
by
the
side
of
a
demure
gentleman
in
plush
henry
foker
esquire
who
had
discovered
this
place
of
devotion
following
the
direction
of
harry
eye
which
strayed
a
good
deal
from
his
book
pen
found
that
it
alighted
upon
a
yellow
bonnet
and
a
pink
one
and
that
these
bonnets
were
on
the
heads
of
lady
clavering
and
blanche
amory
if
pen
uncle
is
not
the
only
man
who
has
talked
about
his
worldly
affairs
up
to
the
church
door
is
poor
harry
foker
the
only
one
who
has
brought
his
worldly
love
into
the
aisle
when
the
congregation
issued
forth
at
the
conclusion
of
the
service
foker
was
out
amongst
the
first
but
pen
came
up
with
him
presently
as
he
was
hankering
about
the
entrance
which
he
was
unwilling
to
leave
until
my
lady
barouche
with
the
bewigged
coachman
had
borne
away
its
mistress
and
her
daughter
from
their
devotions
when
the
two
ladies
came
out
they
found
together
the
pendennises
uncle
and
nephew
and
harry
foker
esquire
sucking
the
crook
of
his
stick
standing
there
in
the
sunshine
to
see
and
to
ask
to
eat
were
simultaneous
with
the
begum
and
she
invited
the
three
gentlemen
to
luncheon
straightway
blanche
was
too
particularly
gracious
o
do
come
she
said
to
arthur
if
you
are
not
too
great
a
man
i
want
so
to
talk
to
you
about
but
we
must
say
what
here
you
know
what
would
oriel
say
and
the
young
devotee
jumped
into
the
carriage
after
her
i
read
every
word
of
it
it
adorable
she
added
still
addressing
herself
to
pen
i
know
who
is
said
arthur
making
rather
a
pert
bow
what
the
row
about
asked
foker
rather
puzzled
i
suppose
miss
clavering
means
lorraine
said
the
major
looking
knowing
and
nodding
at
pen
i
suppose
so
sir
there
was
a
famous
review
in
the
pall
mall
this
morning
it
was
warrington
doing
though
and
i
must
not
be
too
a
review
in
pall
mall
walter
lorraine
what
the
doose
do
you
mean
foker
asked
walter
lorraine
died
of
the
measles
poor
little
beggar
when
we
were
at
grey
friars
i
remember
his
mother
coming
you
are
not
a
literary
man
foker
pen
said
laughing
and
hooking
his
arm
into
his
friend
you
must
know
i
have
been
writing
a
novel
and
some
of
the
papers
have
spoken
very
well
of
it
perhaps
you
do
read
the
sunday
papers
i
read
bell
life
regular
old
boy
mr
foker
answered
at
which
pen
laughed
again
and
the
three
gentlemen
proceeded
in
great
to
lady
clavering
house
the
subject
of
the
novel
was
resumed
after
luncheon
by
miss
amory
who
indeed
loved
poets
and
men
of
letters
if
she
loved
anything
and
was
sincerely
an
artist
in
feeling
some
of
the
passages
in
the
book
made
me
cry
positively
they
did
she
said
pen
said
with
some
fatuity
i
am
happy
to
think
i
have
a
part
of
vos
larmes
miss
blanche
and
the
major
who
had
not
read
more
than
six
pages
of
pen
book
put
on
his
sanctified
look
saying
yes
there
are
some
passages
quite
affecting
affecting
and
oh
if
it
makes
you
cry
lady
amory
declared
she
would
not
read
it
that
she
do
mamma
blanche
said
with
a
french
shrug
of
her
shoulders
and
then
she
fell
into
a
rhapsody
about
the
book
about
the
snatches
of
poetry
interspersed
in
it
about
the
two
heroines
leonora
and
neaera
about
the
two
heroes
walter
lorraine
and
his
rival
the
young
duke
and
what
good
company
you
introduce
us
to
said
the
young
lady
archly
quel
ton
how
much
of
your
life
have
you
passed
at
court
and
are
you
a
prime
minister
son
arthur
pen
began
to
laugh
it
is
as
cheap
for
a
novelist
to
create
a
duke
as
to
make
a
baronet
he
said
shall
i
tell
you
a
secret
miss
amory
i
promoted
all
my
characters
at
the
request
of
the
publisher
the
young
duke
was
only
a
young
baron
when
the
novel
was
first
written
his
false
friend
the
viscount
was
a
simple
commoner
and
so
on
with
all
the
characters
of
the
what
a
wicked
satirical
pert
young
man
you
have
become
comme
vous
voila
forme
said
the
young
lady
how
different
from
arthur
pendennis
of
the
country
ah
i
think
i
like
arthur
pendennis
of
the
country
best
though
and
she
gave
him
the
full
benefit
of
her
eyes
both
of
the
fond
appealing
glance
into
his
own
and
of
the
modest
look
downwards
towards
the
carpet
which
showed
off
her
dark
eyelids
and
long
fringed
lashes
pen
of
course
protested
that
he
had
not
changed
in
the
least
to
which
the
young
lady
replied
by
a
tender
sigh
and
thinking
that
she
had
done
quite
enough
to
make
arthur
happy
or
miserable
as
the
case
might
be
she
proceeded
to
cajole
his
companion
harry
foker
who
during
the
literary
conversation
had
sate
silently
imbibing
the
head
of
his
cane
and
wishing
that
he
was
a
clever
chap
like
that
pen
if
the
major
thought
that
by
telling
miss
amory
of
engagement
to
his
cousin
lady
ann
milton
which
information
the
old
gentleman
neatly
conveyed
to
the
girl
as
he
sate
by
her
side
at
luncheon
if
we
say
the
major
thought
that
the
knowledge
of
this
fact
would
prevent
blanche
from
paying
any
further
attention
to
the
young
heir
of
foker
entire
he
was
entirely
mistaken
she
became
only
the
more
gracious
to
foker
she
praised
him
and
everything
belonging
to
him
she
praised
his
mamma
she
praised
the
pony
which
he
rode
in
the
park
she
praised
the
lovely
breloques
or
gimcracks
which
the
young
gentleman
wore
at
his
and
that
dear
little
darling
of
a
cane
and
those
dear
little
delicious
monkeys
heads
with
ruby
eyes
which
ornamented
harry
shirt
and
formed
the
buttons
of
his
waistcoat
and
then
having
praised
and
coaxed
the
weak
youth
until
he
blushed
and
tingled
with
pleasure
and
until
pen
thought
she
really
had
gone
quite
far
enough
she
took
another
theme
i
am
afraid
foker
is
a
very
sad
young
man
she
said
turning
round
to
pen
he
does
not
look
so
pen
answered
with
a
sneer
i
mean
we
have
heard
sad
stories
about
him
have
we
mamma
what
was
poyntz
saying
here
the
other
day
about
that
party
at
richmond
o
you
naughty
creature
but
here
seeing
that
harry
countenance
assumed
a
great
expression
of
alarm
while
pen
wore
a
look
of
amusement
she
turned
to
the
latter
and
said
i
believe

are
just
as
bad

believe

would
have
liked

foker
though
he
did
not
invite
miss
amory
had
some
delicious
opportunities
of
conversation
with
her
during
the
repast
and
afterwards
on
the
balcony
of
their
room
at
the
hotel
and
again
during
the
drive
home
in
her
ladyship
barouche
pen
came
down
with
his
uncle
in
sir
hugh
trumpington
brougham
which
the
major
borrowed
for
the
occasion
i
am
an
old
soldier
begad
he
said
and
i
learned
in
early
life
to
make
myself
and
being
an
old
soldier
he
allowed
the
two
young
men
to
pay
for
the
dinner
between
them
and
all
the
way
home
in
the
brougham
he
rallied
pen
about
miss
amory
evident
partiality
for
him
praised
her
good
looks
spirits
and
wit
and
again
told
pen
in
the
strictest
confidence
that
she
would
be
a
devilish
deal
richer
than
people
thought
chapter
xlii
contains
a
novel
incident
some
account
has
been
given
in
a
former
part
of
this
story
how
mr
pen
during
his
residence
at
home
after
his
defeat
at
oxbridge
had
occupied
himself
with
various
literary
compositions
and
amongst
other
works
had
written
the
greater
part
of
a
novel
this
book
written
under
the
influence
of
his
youthful
embarrassments
amatory
and
pecuniary
was
of
a
very
fierce
gloomy
and
passionate
sort
the
byronic
despair
the
wertherian
despondency
the
mocking
bitterness
of
mephistopheles
of
faust
were
all
reproduced
and
developed
in
the
character
of
the
hero
for
our
youth
had
just
been
learning
the
german
language
and
imitated
as
almost
all
clever
lads
do
his
favourite
poets
and
writers
passages
in
the
volumes
once
so
loved
and
now
read
so
seldom
still
bear
the
mark
of
the
pencil
with
which
he
noted
them
in
those
days
tears
fell
upon
the
leaf
of
the
book
perhaps
or
blistered
the
pages
of
his
manuscript
as
the
passionate
young
man
dashed
his
thoughts
down
if
he
took
up
the
books
afterwards
he
had
no
ability
or
wish
to
sprinkle
the
leaves
with
that
early
dew
of
former
times
his
pencil
was
no
longer
eager
to
score
its
marks
of
approval
but
as
he
looked
over
the
pages
of
his
manuscript
he
remembered
what
had
been
overflowing
feelings
which
had
caused
him
to
blot
it
and
the
pain
which
had
inspired
the
line
if
the
secret
history
of
books
could
be
written
and
the
author
private
thoughts
and
meanings
noted
down
alongside
of
his
story
how
many
insipid
volumes
would
become
interesting
and
dull
tales
excite
the
reader
many
a
bitter
smile
passed
over
pen
face
as
he
read
his
novel
and
recalled
the
time
and
feelings
which
gave
it
birth
how
pompous
some
of
the
grand
passages
appeared
and
how
weak
were
others
in
which
he
thought
he
had
expressed
his
full
heart
this
page
was
imitated
from
a
then
favourite
author
as
he
could
now
clearly
see
and
confess
though
he
had
believed
himself
to
be
writing
originally
then
as
he
mused
over
certain
lines
he
recollected
the
place
and
hour
where
he
wrote
them
the
ghost
of
the
dead
feeling
came
back
as
he
mused
and
he
blushed
to
review
the
faint
image
and
what
meant
those
blots
on
the
page
as
you
come
in
the
desert
to
a
ground
where
camels
hoofs
are
marked
in
the
clay
and
traces
of
withered
herbage
are
yet
visible
you
know
that
water
was
there
once
so
the
place
in
pen
mind
was
no
longer
green
and
the
fons
lacrymarum
was
dried
up
he
used
this
simile
one
morning
to
warrington
as
the
latter
sate
over
his
pipe
and
book
and
pen
with
much
gesticulation
according
to
his
wont
when
excited
and
with
a
bitter
laugh
thumped
his
manuscript
down
on
the
table
making
the
rattle
and
the
blue
milk
dance
in
the
jug
on
the
previous
night
he
had
taken
the
manuscript
out
of
a
chest
containing
old
shooting
jackets
old
oxbridge
his
old
surplice
and
battered
cap
and
gown
and
other
memorials
of
youth
school
and
home
he
read
in
the
volume
in
bed
until
he
fell
asleep
for
the
commencement
of
the
tale
was
somewhat
dull
and
he
had
come
home
tired
from
a
london
evening
party
by
jove
said
pen
thumping
down
his
papers
when
i
think
that
these
were
written
but
very
few
years
ago
i
am
ashamed
of
my
memory
i
wrote
this
when
i
believed
myself
be
eternally
in
love
with
that
little
coquette
miss
amory
i
used
to
carry
down
verses
to
her
and
put
them
into
the
hollow
of
a
tree
and
dedicate
them
that
was
a
sweet
little
play
upon
words
warrington
remarked
with
a
puff
amory
amori
it
showed
proof
of
scholarship
let
us
hear
a
bit
of
the
and
he
stretched
over
from
his
and
caught
hold
of
pen
manuscript
with
the
which
he
was
just
using
in
order
to
put
a
coal
into
his
pipe
thus
in
possession
of
the
volume
he
began
to
read
out
from
the
from
the
of
walter
lorraine
as
thou
art
beautiful
heartless
as
thou
art
fair
mockery
of
passion
walter
cried
addressing
leonora
evil
spirit
hath
sent
thee
to
torture
me
so
o
cut
that
part
cried
out
pen
making
a
dash
at
the
book
which
however
his
comrade
would
not
release
well
do
read
it
out
at
any
rate
that
about
my
other
flame
my
first
lady
mirabel
that
is
now
i
saw
her
last
night
at
lady
whiston
she
asked
me
to
a
party
at
her
house
and
said
that
as
old
friends
we
ought
to
meet
oftener
she
has
been
seeing
me
any
time
these
two
years
in
town
and
never
thought
of
inviting
me
before
but
seeing
wenham
talking
to
me
and
monsieur
dubois
the
french
literary
man
who
had
a
dozen
orders
on
and
might
have
passed
for
a
marshal
of
france
she
condescended
to
invite
me
the
claverings
are
to
be
there
on
the
same
evening
wo
it
be
exciting
to
meet
one
two
flames
at
the
same
table
two
flames
two
heaps
of
cinders
warrington
said
are
both
the
beauties
in
this
book
both
or
something
like
them
pen
said
leonora
who
marries
the
duke
is
the
fotheringay
i
drew
the
duke
from
magnus
charters
with
whom
i
was
at
oxford
it
a
little
like
him
and
miss
amory
is
neaera
by
gad
that
first
woman
i
thought
of
her
as
i
walked
home
from
lady
whiston
in
the
moonlight
and
the
whole
early
scenes
came
back
to
me
as
if
they
had
been
yesterday
and
when
i
got
home
i
pulled
out
the
story
which
i
wrote
about
her
and
the
other
three
years
ago
do
you
know
outrageous
as
it
is
it
has
some
good
stuff
in
it
and
if
bungay
wo
publish
it
i
think
bacon
that
the
way
of
poets
said
warrington
they
fall
in
love
jilt
or
are
jilted
they
suffer
and
they
cry
out
that
they
suffer
more
than
any
other
mortals
and
when
they
have
experienced
feelings
enough
they
note
them
down
in
a
book
and
take
the
book
to
market
all
poets
are
humbugs
all
literary
men
are
humbugs
directly
a
man
begins
to
sell
his
feelings
for
money
he
a
humbug
if
a
poet
gets
a
pain
in
his
side
from
too
good
a
dinner
he
bellows
ai
ai
louder
than
i
suppose
a
poet
has
a
greater
sensibility
than
another
man
said
pen
with
some
spirit
that
is
what
makes
him
a
poet
i
suppose
that
he
sees
and
feels
more
keenly
it
is
that
which
makes
him
speak
of
what
he
feels
and
sees
you
speak
eagerly
enough
in
your
leading
articles
when
you
espy
a
false
argument
in
an
opponent
or
detect
a
quack
in
the
house
paley
who
does
not
care
for
anything
else
in
the
world
will
talk
for
an
hour
about
a
question
of
law
give
another
the
privilege
which
you
take
yourself
and
the
free
use
of
his
faculty
and
let
him
be
what
nature
has
made
him
why
should
not
a
man
sell
his
sentimental
thoughts
as
well
as
you
your
political
ideas
or
paley
his
legal
knowledge
each
alike
is
a
matter
of
experience
and
practice
it
is
not
money
which
causes
you
to
perceive
a
fallacy
or
paley
to
argue
a
point
but
a
natural
or
acquired
aptitude
for
that
kind
of
truth
and
a
poet
sets
down
his
thoughts
and
experiences
upon
paper
as
a
painter
does
a
landscape
or
a
face
upon
canvas
to
the
best
of
his
ability
and
according
to
his
particular
gift
if
ever
i
think
i
have
the
stuff
in
me
to
write
an
epic
by
jove
i
will
try
if
i
only
feel
that
i
am
good
enough
to
crack
a
joke
or
tell
a
story
i
will
do
not
a
bad
speech
young
one
warrington
said
but
that
does
not
prevent
all
poets
from
being
what
homer
aeschylus
shakspeare
and
all
their
names
are
not
to
be
breathed
in
the
same
sense
with
you
pigmies
warrington
said
there
are
men
and
men
well
shakspeare
was
a
man
who
wrote
for
money
just
as
you
and
i
do
pen
answered
at
which
warrington
confounded
his
impudence
and
resumed
his
pipe
and
his
manuscript
there
was
not
the
slightest
doubt
then
that
this
document
contained
a
great
deal
of
pen
personal
experiences
and
that
from
the
of
walter
lorraine
would
never
have
been
written
but
for
arthur
pendennis
own
private
griefs
passions
and
follies
as
we
have
become
acquainted
with
these
in
the
first
volume
of
his
biography
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
make
large
extracts
from
the
novel
of
lorraine
in
which
the
young
gentleman
had
depicted
such
of
them
as
he
thought
were
likely
to
interest
the
reader
or
were
suitable
for
the
purpose
of
his
story
now
though
he
had
kept
it
in
his
box
for
nearly
half
of
the
period
during
which
according
to
the
horatian
maxim
a
work
of
art
ought
to
lie
ripening
a
maxim
the
truth
of
which
may
by
the
way
be
questioned
altogether
mr
pen
had
not
buried
his
novel
for
this
time
in
order
that
the
work
might
improve
but
because
he
did
not
know
where
else
to
bestow
it
or
had
no
particular
desire
to
see
it
a
man
who
thinks
of
putting
away
a
composition
for
ten
years
before
he
shall
give
it
to
the
world
or
exercise
his
own
maturer
judgment
upon
it
had
best
be
very
sure
of
the
original
strength
and
durability
of
the
work
otherwise
on
withdrawing
it
from
its
crypt
he
may
find
that
like
small
wine
it
has
lost
what
flavour
it
once
had
and
is
only
tasteless
when
opened
there
are
works
of
all
tastes
and
smacks
the
small
and
the
strong
those
that
improve
by
age
and
those
that
wo
bear
keeping
at
all
but
are
pleasant
at
the
first
draught
when
they
refresh
and
sparkle
now
pen
had
never
any
notion
even
in
the
time
of
his
youthful
inexperience
and
fervour
of
imagination
that
the
story
he
was
writing
was
a
masterpiece
of
composition
or
that
he
was
the
equal
of
the
great
authors
whom
he
admired
and
when
he
now
reviewed
his
little
performance
he
was
keenly
enough
alive
to
its
faults
and
pretty
modest
regarding
its
merits
it
was
not
very
good
he
thought
but
it
was
as
good
as
most
books
of
the
kind
that
had
the
run
of
circulating
libraries
and
the
career
of
the
season
he
had
critically
examined
more
than
one
fashionable
novel
by
the
authors
of
the
day
then
popular
and
he
thought
that
his
intellect
was
as
good
as
theirs
and
that
he
could
write
the
english
language
as
well
as
those
ladies
or
gentlemen
and
as
he
now
ran
over
his
early
performance
he
was
pleased
to
find
here
and
there
passages
exhibiting
both
fancy
and
vigour
and
traits
if
not
of
genius
of
genuine
passion
and
feeling
this
too
was
warrington
verdict
when
that
severe
critic
after
half
an
hour
perusal
of
the
manuscript
and
the
consumption
of
a
couple
of
pipes
of
tobacco
laid
pen
book
down
yawning
portentously
i
ca
read
any
more
of
that
balderdash
now
he
said
but
it
seems
to
me
there
is
some
good
stuff
in
it
pen
my
boy
there
a
certain
greenness
and
freshness
in
it
which
i
like
somehow
the
bloom
disappears
off
the
face
of
poetry
after
you
begin
to
shave
you
ca
get
up
that
naturalness
and
artless
rosy
tint
in
after
days
your
cheeks
are
pale
and
have
got
faded
by
exposure
to
evening
parties
and
you
are
obliged
to
take
and
macassar
and
the
to
your
whiskers
they
curl
ambrosially
and
you
are
very
grand
and
genteel
and
so
forth
but
ah
pen
the
was
the
what
the
deuce
have
my
whiskers
to
do
with
the
subject
in
hand
pen
said
who
perhaps
may
have
been
nettled
by
warrington
allusion
to
those
ornaments
which
to
say
the
truth
the
young
man
coaxed
and
curled
and
oiled
and
perfumed
and
petted
in
rather
an
absurd
manner
do
you
think
we
can
do
anything
with
lorraine
shall
we
take
him
to
the
publishers
or
make
an
of
him
i
do
see
what
is
the
good
of
incremation
warrington
said
though
i
have
a
great
mind
to
put
him
into
the
fire
to
punish
your
atrocious
humbug
and
hypocrisy
shall
i
burn
him
indeed
you
have
much
too
great
a
value
for
him
to
hurt
a
hair
of
his
have
i
here
goes
said
pen
and
lorraine
went
off
the
table
and
was
flung
on
to
the
coals
but
the
fire
having
done
its
duty
of
boiling
the
young
man
had
given
up
work
for
the
day
and
had
gone
out
as
pen
knew
very
well
warrington
with
a
scornful
smile
once
more
took
up
the
manuscript
with
the
tongs
from
out
of
the
harmless
cinders
oh
pen
what
a
humbug
you
are
warrington
said
and
what
is
worst
of
all
sir
a
clumsy
humbug
i
saw
you
look
to
see
that
the
fire
was
out
before
you
sent
lorraine
behind
the
bars
no
we
wo
burn
him
we
will
carry
him
to
the
egyptians
and
sell
him
we
will
exchange
him
away
for
money
yea
for
silver
and
gold
and
for
beef
and
for
liquors
and
for
tobacco
and
for
raiment
this
youth
will
fetch
some
price
in
the
market
for
he
is
a
comely
lad
though
not
over
strong
but
we
will
fatten
him
up
and
give
him
the
bath
and
curl
his
hair
and
we
will
sell
him
for
a
hundred
piasters
to
bacon
or
to
bungay
the
rubbish
is
saleable
enough
sir
and
my
advice
to
you
is
this
the
next
time
you
go
home
for
a
holiday
take
lorraine
in
your
give
him
a
more
modern
air
prune
away
though
sparingly
some
of
the
green
passages
and
add
a
little
comedy
and
cheerfulness
and
satire
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
then
we
take
him
to
market
and
sell
him
the
book
is
not
a
wonder
of
wonders
but
it
will
do
very
do
you
think
so
warrington
said
pen
delighted
for
this
was
great
praise
from
his
cynical
friend
you
silly
young
fool
i
think
it
uncommonly
clever
warrington
said
in
a
kind
voice
so
do
you
and
with
the
manuscript
which
he
held
in
his
hand
he
playfully
struck
pen
on
the
cheek
that
part
of
countenance
turned
as
red
as
it
had
ever
done
in
the
earliest
days
of
his
blushes
he
grasped
the
other
hand
and
said
thank
you
warrington
with
all
his
might
and
then
he
retired
to
his
own
room
with
his
book
and
passed
the
greater
part
of
the
day
upon
his
bed
it
and
he
did
as
warrington
had
advised
and
altered
not
a
little
and
added
a
great
deal
until
at
length
he
had
fashioned
lorraine
pretty
much
into
the
shape
in
which
as
the
respected
knows
it
subsequently
appeared
whilst
he
was
at
work
upon
this
performance
the
warrington
artfully
inspired
the
two
gentlemen
who
read
for
bacon
and
bungay
with
the
greatest
curiosity
regarding
lorraine
and
pointed
out
the
peculiar
merits
of
its
distinguished
author
it
was
at
the
period
when
the
novel
called
fashionable
was
in
vogue
among
us
and
warrington
did
not
fail
to
point
out
as
before
how
pen
was
a
man
of
the
very
first
fashion
himself
and
received
at
the
houses
of
some
of
the
greatest
personages
in
the
land
the
simple
and
percy
popjoy
was
brought
to
bear
upon
bungay
whom
he
informed
that
his
friend
pendennis
was
occupied
upon
a
work
of
the
most
exciting
nature
a
work
that
the
whole
town
would
run
after
full
of
wit
genius
satire
pathos
and
every
conceivable
good
quality
we
have
said
before
that
bungay
knew
no
more
about
novels
than
he
did
about
hebrew
or
algebra
and
neither
read
nor
understood
any
of
the
books
which
he
published
and
paid
for
but
he
took
his
opinions
from
his
professional
advisers
and
from
and
evidently
with
a
view
to
a
commercial
transaction
asked
pendennis
and
warrington
to
dinner
again
bacon
when
he
found
that
bungay
was
about
to
treat
of
course
began
to
be
anxious
and
curious
and
desired
to
outbid
his
rival
was
anything
settled
between
pendennis
and
the
odious
house
over
the
way
about
the
new
book
hack
the
confidential
reader
was
told
to
make
inquiries
and
see
if
any
thing
was
to
be
done
and
the
result
of
the
inquiries
of
that
diplomatist
was
that
one
morning
bacon
himself
toiled
up
the
staircase
of
lamb
court
and
to
the
door
on
which
the
names
of
warrington
and
pendennis
were
painted
for
a
gentleman
of
fashion
as
poor
pen
was
represented
to
be
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
apartments
he
and
his
friend
occupied
were
not
very
suitable
the
ragged
carpet
had
grown
only
more
ragged
during
the
two
years
of
joint
occupancy
a
constant
odour
of
tobacco
perfumed
the
bacon
tumbled
over
the
laundress
buckets
in
the
passage
through
which
he
had
to
pass
warrington
was
as
tattered
at
the
elbows
as
usual
and
the
chair
which
bacon
was
requested
to
take
on
entering
broke
down
with
the
publisher
warrington
burst
out
laughing
said
that
bacon
had
got
the
game
chair
and
bawled
out
to
pen
to
fetch
a
sound
one
from
his
bedroom
and
seeing
the
publisher
looking
round
the
dingy
room
with
an
air
of
profound
pity
and
wonder
asked
him
whether
he
did
think
the
apartments
were
elegant
and
if
he
would
like
for
bacon
any
of
the
articles
of
furniture
warrington
character
as
a
humourist
was
known
to
bacon
i
never
can
make
that
chap
out
the
publisher
was
heard
to
say
or
tell
whether
he
is
in
earnest
or
only
it
is
very
possible
that
bacon
would
have
set
the
two
gentlemen
down
as
impostors
altogether
but
that
there
chanced
to
be
on
the
certain
cards
of
invitation
which
the
post
of
the
morning
had
brought
in
for
pen
and
which
happened
to
come
from
some
very
exalted
personage
of
the
into
which
our
young
man
had
his
introduction
looking
down
upon
these
bacon
saw
that
the
marchioness
of
steyne
would
be
at
home
to
arthur
pendennis
upon
a
given
day
and
that
another
lady
of
distinction
proposed
to
have
dancing
at
her
house
upon
a
certain
future
evening
warrington
saw
the
admiring
publisher
eyeing
these
documents
ah
said
he
with
an
air
of
simplicity
pendennis
is
one
of
the
most
affable
young
men
i
ever
knew
bacon
here
is
a
young
fellow
that
dines
with
all
the
men
in
london
and
yet
he
take
his
with
you
and
me
quite
contentedly
there
nothing
like
the
affability
of
the
old
english
oh
no
nothing
said
bacon
and
you
wonder
why
he
should
go
on
living
up
three
pair
of
stairs
with
me
do
you
now
well
it
is
a
queer
taste
but
we
are
fond
of
each
other
and
as
i
ca
afford
to
live
in
a
great
house
he
comes
and
stays
in
these
rickety
old
chambers
with
me
he
a
man
that
can
afford
to
live
i
fancy
it
do
cost
him
much
here
thought
bacon
and
the
object
of
these
praises
presently
entered
the
room
from
his
adjacent
sleeping
apartment
then
bacon
began
to
speak
upon
the
subject
of
his
visit
said
he
heard
that
pendennis
had
a
manuscript
novel
professed
himself
anxious
to
have
a
sight
of
that
work
and
had
no
doubt
that
they
could
come
to
terms
respecting
it
what
would
be
his
price
for
it
would
he
give
bacon
the
refusal
of
it
he
would
find
our
house
a
liberal
house
and
so
forth
the
delighted
pen
assumed
an
air
of
indifference
and
said
that
he
was
already
in
treaty
with
bungay
and
could
give
no
definite
answer
this
piqued
the
other
into
such
liberal
though
vague
offers
that
pen
began
to
fancy
eldorado
was
opening
to
him
and
that
his
fortune
was
made
from
that
day
i
shall
not
mention
what
was
the
sum
of
money
which
arthur
pendennis
finally
received
for
the
first
edition
of
his
novel
of
lorraine
lest
other
young
literary
aspirants
should
expect
to
be
as
lucky
as
he
was
and
unprofessional
persons
forsake
their
own
callings
whatever
they
may
be
for
the
sake
of
supplying
the
world
with
novels
whereof
there
is
already
a
sufficiency
let
no
young
people
be
misled
and
rush
fatally
into
for
one
book
which
succeeds
let
them
remember
the
many
that
fail
i
do
not
say
deservedly
or
otherwise
and
wholesomely
abstain
or
if
they
venture
at
least
let
them
do
so
at
their
own
peril
as
for
those
who
have
already
written
novels
this
warning
is
not
addressed
of
course
to
them
let
them
take
their
wares
to
market
let
them
apply
to
bacon
and
bungay
and
all
the
publishers
in
the
row
or
the
metropolis
and
may
they
be
happy
in
their
ventures
this
world
is
so
wide
and
the
tastes
of
mankind
happily
so
various
that
there
is
always
a
chance
for
every
man
and
he
may
win
the
prize
by
his
genius
or
by
his
good
fortune
but
what
is
the
chance
of
success
or
failure
of
obtaining
popularity
or
of
holding
it
when
achieved
one
man
goes
over
the
ice
which
bears
him
and
a
score
who
follow
flounder
in
in
fine
pendennis
was
an
exceptional
case
and
applies
to
himself
only
and
i
assert
solemnly
and
will
to
the
last
maintain
that
it
is
one
thing
to
write
a
novel
and
another
to
get
money
for
it
by
merit
then
or
good
fortune
or
the
skilful
playing
off
of
bungay
against
bacon
which
warrington
performed
and
which
an
amateur
novelist
is
quite
welcome
to
try
upon
any
two
publishers
in
the
trade
novel
was
actually
sold
for
a
certain
sum
of
money
to
one
of
the
two
eminent
patrons
of
letters
whom
we
have
introduced
to
our
readers
the
sum
was
so
considerable
that
pen
thought
of
opening
an
account
at
a
banker
or
of
keeping
a
cab
and
horse
or
of
descending
into
the
first
floor
of
lamb
court
into
newly
furnished
apartments
or
of
migrating
to
the
fashionable
end
of
the
town
major
pendennis
advised
the
latter
move
strongly
he
opened
his
eyes
with
wonder
when
he
heard
of
the
good
luck
that
had
befallen
pen
and
which
the
latter
as
soon
as
it
occurred
hastened
eagerly
to
communicate
to
his
uncle
the
major
was
almost
angry
that
pen
should
have
earned
so
much
money
who
the
doose
reads
this
kind
of
thing
he
thought
to
himself
when
he
heard
of
the
bargain
which
pen
had
made
i
never
read
your
novels
and
rubbish
except
paul
de
kock
who
certainly
makes
me
laugh
i
do
think
i
looked
into
a
book
of
the
sort
these
thirty
years
gad
pen
a
lucky
fellow
i
should
think
he
might
write
one
of
these
in
a
month
now
say
a
month
that
twelve
in
a
year
dammy
he
may
go
on
spinning
this
nonsense
for
the
next
four
to
five
years
and
make
a
fortune
in
the
meantime
i
should
wish
him
to
live
properly
take
respectable
apartments
and
keep
a
and
on
this
simple
calculation
it
was
that
the
major
counselled
pen
arthur
laughing
told
warrington
what
his
uncle
advice
had
been
but
he
luckily
had
a
much
more
reasonable
counsellor
than
the
old
gentleman
in
the
person
of
his
friend
and
in
his
own
conscience
which
said
to
him
be
grateful
for
this
piece
of
good
fortune
do
plunge
into
any
extravagancies
pay
back
laura
and
he
wrote
a
letter
to
her
in
which
he
told
her
his
thanks
and
his
regard
and
enclosed
to
her
such
an
instalment
of
his
debt
as
nearly
wiped
it
off
the
widow
and
laura
herself
might
well
be
affected
by
the
letter
it
was
written
with
genuine
tenderness
and
modesty
and
old
portman
when
he
read
a
passage
in
the
letter
in
which
pen
with
an
honest
heart
full
of
gratitude
humbly
thanked
heaven
for
his
present
prosperity
and
for
sending
him
such
dear
and
kind
friends
to
support
him
in
his
ill
fortune
when
doctor
portman
read
this
portion
of
the
letter
his
voice
faltered
and
his
eyes
twinkled
behind
his
spectacles
and
when
he
had
quite
finished
reading
the
same
and
had
taken
his
glasses
off
his
nose
and
had
folded
up
the
paper
and
given
it
back
to
the
widow
i
am
constrained
to
say
that
after
holding
pendennis
hand
for
a
minute
the
doctor
drew
that
lady
towards
him
and
fairly
kissed
her
at
which
salute
of
course
helen
burst
out
crying
on
the
shoulder
for
her
heart
was
too
full
to
give
any
other
reply
and
the
doctor
blushing
at
great
deal
after
his
feat
led
the
lady
with
a
bow
to
the
sofa
on
which
he
seated
himself
by
her
and
he
mumbled
out
in
a
low
voice
some
words
of
a
great
poet
whom
he
loved
very
much
and
who
describes
how
in
the
days
of
his
prosperity
he
had
made
the
heart
to
sing
for
the
letter
does
the
boy
very
great
honour
very
great
honour
my
dear
he
said
patting
it
as
it
lay
on
helen
knee
and
i
think
we
have
all
reason
to
be
thankful
for
it
very
thankful
i
need
not
tell
you
in
what
quarter
my
dear
for
you
are
a
sainted
woman
yes
laura
my
love
your
mother
is
a
sainted
woman
and
pendennis
i
shall
order
a
copy
of
the
book
for
myself
and
another
at
the
book
we
may
be
sure
that
the
widow
and
laura
walked
out
to
meet
the
mail
which
brought
them
their
copy
of
pen
precious
novel
as
soon
as
that
work
was
printed
and
ready
for
delivery
to
the
public
and
that
they
read
it
to
each
other
and
that
they
also
read
it
privately
and
separately
for
when
the
widow
came
out
of
her
room
in
her
at
one
in
the
morning
with
volume
two
which
she
had
finished
she
found
laura
devouring
volume
three
in
bed
laura
did
not
say
much
about
the
book
but
helen
pronounced
that
it
was
a
happy
mixture
of
shakspeare
and
byron
and
walter
scott
and
was
quite
certain
that
her
son
was
the
greatest
genius
as
he
was
the
best
son
in
the
world
did
laura
not
think
about
the
book
and
the
author
although
she
said
so
little
at
least
she
thought
about
arthur
pendennis
kind
as
his
tone
was
it
vexed
her
she
did
not
like
his
eagerness
to
repay
that
money
she
would
rather
that
her
brother
had
taken
her
gift
as
she
intended
it
and
was
pained
that
there
should
be
money
calculations
between
them

letters
from

with
the
wish
to
amuse
his
mother
were
full
of
descriptions
of
the
famous
people
and
the
entertainments
and
magnificence
of
the
great
city
everybody
was
flattering
him
and
spoiling
him
she
was
sure
was
he
not
looking
to
some
great
marriage
with
that
cunning
uncle
for
a
mentor
between
whom
and
laura
there
was
always
an
antipathy
that
inveterate
worldling
whose
whole
thoughts
were
bent
upon
pleasure
and
rank
and
fortune
he
never
alluded
to
to
old
times
when
he
spoke
of
her
he
had
forgotten
them
and
her
perhaps
had
he
not
forgotten
other
things
and
people
these
thoughts
may
have
passed
in
miss
laura
mind
though
she
did
not
she
could
not
confide
them
to
helen
she
had
one
more
secret
too
from
that
lady
which
she
could
not
divulge
perhaps
because
she
knew
how
the
widow
would
have
rejoiced
to
know
it
this
regarded
an
event
which
had
occurred
during
that
visit
to
lady
rockminster
which
laura
had
paid
in
the
last
christmas
holidays
when
pen
was
at
home
with
his
mother
and
when
pynsent
supposed
to
be
so
cold
and
so
ambitious
had
formally
offered
his
hand
to
miss
bell
no
one
except
herself
and
her
admirer
knew
of
this
proposal
or
that
pynsent
had
been
rejected
by
her
and
probably
the
reasons
she
gave
to
the
mortified
young
man
himself
were
not
those
which
actuated
her
refusal
or
those
which
she
chose
to
acknowledge
to
herself
i
never
she
told
pynsent
can
accept
such
an
offer
as
that
which
you
make
me
which
you
own
is
unknown
to
your
family
as
i
am
sure
it
would
be
unwelcome
to
them
the
difference
of
rank
between
us
is
too
great
you
are
very
kind
to
me
here
too
good
and
kind
dear
pynsent
but
i
am
little
better
than
a
a
dependant
who
ever
so
thought
of
you
you
are
the
equal
of
all
the
world
pynsent
broke
out
i
am
a
dependant
at
home
too
laura
said
sweetly
and
indeed
i
would
not
be
otherwise
left
early
a
poor
orphan
i
have
found
the
kindest
and
tenderest
of
mothers
and
i
have
vowed
never
to
leave
her
never
pray
do
not
speak
of
this
again
here
under
your
relative
roof
or
elsewhere
it
is
if
lady
rockminster
asks
you
herself
will
you
listen
to
her
pynsent
cried
eagerly
no
laura
said
i
beg
you
never
to
speak
of
this
any
more
i
must
go
away
if
you
do
and
with
this
she
left
him
pynsent
never
asked
for
lady
rockminster
intercession
he
knew
how
vain
it
was
to
look
for
that
and
he
never
spoke
again
on
that
subject
to
laura
or
to
any
person
when
at
length
the
famous
novel
appeared
it
not
only
met
with
applause
from
more
impartial
critics
than
pendennis
but
luckily
for
pen
it
suited
the
taste
of
the
public
and
obtained
a
quick
and
considerable
popularity
before
two
months
were
over
pen
had
the
satisfaction
and
surprise
of
seeing
the
second
edition
of
lorraine
advertised
in
the
newspapers
and
enjoyed
the
pleasure
of
reading
and
sending
home
the
critiques
of
various
literary
journals
and
reviewers
upon
his
book
their
censure
did
not
much
affect
him
for
the
young
man
was
disposed
to
accept
with
considerable
humility
the
dispraises
of
others
nor
did
their
praise
elate
him
over
much
for
like
most
honest
persons
he
had
his
own
opinion
about
his
own
performance
and
when
a
critic
praised
him
in
the
wrong
place
he
was
rather
hurt
than
pleased
by
the
compliment
but
if
a
review
of
his
work
was
very
laudatory
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
him
to
send
it
home
to
his
mother
at
fairoaks
and
to
think
of
the
joy
which
it
would
give
there
there
are
some
natures
and
perhaps
as
we
have
said
pendennis
was
one
which
are
improved
and
softened
by
prosperity
and
kindness
as
there
are
men
of
other
dispositions
who
become
arrogant
and
graceless
under
good
fortune
happy
he
who
can
endure
one
or
the
other
with
modesty
and
lucky
he
who
has
been
educated
to
bear
his
fate
whatsoever
it
may
be
by
an
early
example
of
uprightness

hear

piano
of
fine
days
when
the

are
open

or

fanny
bolton
is
one
the
porteress
daughter
who
has
heard
tell
of
her

theatrical
glories
which
she
longs
to
emulate
she
has
a
good
voice
and
a
pretty
face
and
figure
for
the
stage
and
she
prepares
the
rooms
and
makes
the
beds
and
breakfasts
for
costigan
and
bows
in
return
for
which
the
latter
instructs
her
in
music
and
singing
but
for
his
unfortunate
propensity
to
liquor
and
in
that
excess
she
supposes
that
all
men
of
fashion
indulge
she
thinks
the
captain
the
finest
gentleman
in
the
world
and
believes
in
all
the
versions
of
all
his
stories
and
she
is
very
fond
of
bows
too
and
very
grateful
to
him
and
this
shy
queer
old
gentleman
has
a
fatherly
fondness
for
her
too
for
in
truth
his
heart
is
full
of
kindness
and
he
is
never
easy
unless
he
loves
somebody
costigan
has
had
the
carriages
of
visitors
of
distinction
before
his
humble
door
in
shepherd
inn
and
to
hear
him
talk
of
a
morning
for
his
evening
song
is
of
a
much
more
melancholy
nature
you
would
fancy
that
sir
charles
and
lady
mirabel
were
in
the
constant
habit
of
calling
at
his
chambers
and
bringing
with
them
the
select
nobility
to
visit
the
old
man
the
honest
old
captain
poor
old
jack
costigan
as
cos
calls
himself
the
truth
is
that
lady
mirabel
has
left
her
husband
card
which
has
been
stuck
in
the
little
over
the
mantelpiece
of
the
at
no
for
these
many
months
past
and
has
come
in
person
to
see
her
father
but
not
of
late
days
a
kind
person
disposed
to
discharge
her
duties
gravely
upon
her
marriage
with
sir
charles
she
settled
a
little
pension
upon
her
father
who
occasionally
was
admitted
to
the
table
of
his
daughter
and
at
first
poor
behaviour
in
the
hoight
of
poloit
societee
as
he
denominated
lady
mirabel
table
was
harmless
if
it
was
absurd
as
he
clothed
his
person
in
his
best
attire
so
he
selected
the
longest
and
richest
words
in
his
vocabulary
to
deck
his
conversation
and
adopted
a
solemnity
of
demeanour
which
struck
with
astonishment
all
those
persons
in
whose
company
he
happened
to
was
your
leedyship
in
the
pork
to
dee
he
would
demand
of
his
daughter
i
looked
for
your
equipage
in
veen
the
poor
old
man
was
not
gratified
by
the
soight
of
his
daughther
choriot
sir
chorlus
i
saw
your
neem
at
the
levee
the
levee
at
the
castle
at
dublin
that
poor
old
jack
costigan
has
attended
in
his
time
did
the
juke
look
pretty
well
bedad
i
call
at
apsley
house
and
lave
me
cyard
upon
i
thank
ye
james
a
little
dthrop
more
indeed
he
was
magnificent
in
his
courtesy
to
all
and
addressed
his
observations
not
only
to
the
master
and
the
guests
but
to
the
domestics
who
waited
at
the
table
and
who
had
some
difficulty
in
maintaining
their
professional
gravity
while
they
waited
on
captain
costigan
on
the
first
two
or
three
visits
to
his
costigan
maintained
a
strict
sobriety
content
to
make
up
for
his
lost
time
when
he
got
to
the
back
kitchen
where
he
bragged
about
his
dart
and
burgundee
until
his
own
utterance
began
to
fail
him
over
his
sixth
tumbler
of
but
with
familiarity
his
caution
vanished
and
poor
cos
lamentably
disgraced
himself
at
sir
charles
mirabel
table
by
premature
inebriation
a
carriage
was
called
for
him
the
hospitable
door
was
shut
upon
him
often
and
sadly
did
he
speak
to
his
friends
at
the
kitchen
of
his
resemblance
to
king
lear
in
the
plee
of
his
having
a
thankless
choild
bedad
of
his
being
a
pore
lonely
old
man
dthriven
to
dthrinking
by
ingratitude
and
seeking
to
dthrown
his
sorrows
in
punch
it
is
painful
to
be
obliged
to
record
the
weaknesses
of
fathers
but
it
must
be
furthermore
told
of
costigan
that
when
his
credit
was
exhausted
and
his
money
gone
he
would
not
unfrequently
beg
money
from
his
daughter
and
made
statements
to
her
not
altogether
consistent
with
strict
truth
on
one
day
a
bailiff
was
about
to
lead
him
to
prison
he
wrote
unless
the
to
you
insignificant
sum
of
three
pound
five
can
be
forthcoming
to
liberate
a
poor
man
grey
hairs
from
and
the
lady
mirabel
despatched
the
money
necessary
for
her
father
liberation
with
a
caution
to
him
to
be
more
economical
for
the
future
on
a
second
occasion
the
captain
met
with
a
frightful
accident
and
broke
a
window
in
the
strand
for
which
the
proprietor
of
the
shop
held
him
liable
the
money
was
forthcoming
on
this
time
too
to
repair
her
papa
disaster
and
was
carried
down
by
lady
servant
to
the
slipshod
messenger
and
of
the
captain
who
brought
the
letter
announcing
his
mishap
if
the
servant
had
followed
the
captain
who
carried
the
remittance
he
would
have
seen
that
gentleman
a
person
of
costigan
country
too
for
have
we
not
said
that
however
poor
an
irish
gentleman
is
he
always
has
a
poorer
irish
gentleman
to
run
on
his
errands
and
transact
his
pecuniary
affairs
call
a
cab
from
the
nearest
stand
and
rattle
down
to
the
roscius
head
harlequin
yard
drury
lane
where
the
captain
was
indeed
in
pawn
and
for
several
glasses
containing
or
other
spirituous
refreshment
of
which
he
and
his
staff
had
partaken
on
a
third
melancholy
occasion
he
wrote
that
he
was
attacked
by
illness
and
wanted
money
to
pay
the
physician
whom
he
was
compelled
to
call
in
and
this
time
lady
mirabel
alarmed
about
her
father
safety
and
perhaps
reproaching
herself
that
she
had
of
late
lost
sight
of
her
father
called
for
her
carriage
and
drove
to
shepherd
inn
at
the
gate
of
which
she
alighted
whence
she
found
the
way
to
her
father
chambers
no
third
floor
name
of
podmore
over
the
door
the
porteress
said
with
many
curtsies
pointing
towards
the
door
of
the
house
into
which
the
affectionate
daughter
entered
and
mounted
the
dingy
stair
alas
the
door
surmounted
by
the
name
of
podmore
was
opened
to
her
by
poor
cos
in
his
and
prepared
with
the
gridiron
to
receive
the
which
bolton
had
gone
to
purchase
also
it
was
not
pleasant
for
sir
charles
mirabel
to
have
letters
constantly
addressed
to
him
at
brookes
with
the
information
that
captain
costigan
was
in
the
hall
waiting
for
an
answer
or
when
he
went
to
play
his
rubber
at
the
travellers
to
be
obliged
to
shoot
out
of
his
brougham
and
run
up
the
steps
rapidly
lest
his
should
seize
upon
him
and
to
think
that
while
he
read
his
paper
or
played
his
whist
the
captain
was
walking
on
the
opposite
side
of
pall
mall
with
that
dreadful
cocked
hat
and
the
eye
beneath
it
fixed
steadily
upon
the
windows
of
the
club
sir
charles
was
a
weak
man
he
was
old
and
had
many
infirmities
he
cried
about
his
to
his
wife
whom
he
adored
with
senile
infatuation
he
said
he
must
go
abroad
he
must
go
and
live
in
the
country
he
should
die
or
have
another
fit
if
he
saw
that
man
again
he
knew
he
should
and
it
was
only
by
paying
a
second
visit
to
captain
costigan
and
representing
to
him
that
if
he
plagued
sir
charles
by
letters
or
addressed
him
in
the
street
or
made
any
further
applications
for
loans
his
allowance
would
be
withdrawn
altogether
that
lady
mirabel
was
enabled
to
keep
her
papa
in
order
and
to
restore
tranquillity
to
her
husband
and
on
occasion
of
this
visit
she
sternly
rebuked
bows
for
not
keeping
a
better
watch
over
the
captain
desired
that
he
should
not
be
allowed
to
drink
in
that
shameful
way
and
that
the
people
at
the
horrid
taverns
which
he
frequented
should
be
told
upon
no
account
to
give
him
credit
papa
conduct
is
bringing
me
to
the
grave
she
said
though
she
looked
perfectly
healthy
and
you
as
an
old
man
bows
and
one
that
pretended
to
have
a
regard
for
us
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
abetting
him
in
those
were
the
thanks
which
honest
bows
got
for
his
friendship
and
his
devotion
and
i
do
not
suppose
that
the
old
philosopher
was
much
worse
off
than
many
other
men
or
had
greater
reason
to
grumble
on
the
second
floor
of
the
next
house
to
bows
in
shepherd

two
other
acquaintances
of
ours

agent
to
the
nawaub
of
lucknow
and
captain
chevalier
edward
strong
no
name
at
all
is
over
their
door
the
captain
does
not
choose
to
let
all
the
world
know
where
he
lives
and
his
cards
bear
the
address
of
a
jermyn
street
hotel
and
as
for

ambassador
plenipotentiary
of
the
indian
potentate
he
is
not
an
envoy
accredited
to

courts
of

is
here
on
a
confidential

quite
independent

object
being
financial
and
to
effectuate
a
sale
of
some
of
the
principal
diamonds
and
rubies
of
the
lucknow
crown
his
wish
is
not
to
report
himself
at
the
india
house
or
in
cannon
row
but
rather
to
negotiate
with
private
capitalists
with
whom
he
has
had
important
transactions
both
in
this
country
and
on
the
we
have
said
that
these
anonymous
chambers
of
strong
had
been
very
comfortably
furnished
since
the
arrival
of
sir
francis
clavering
in
london
and
the
chevalier
might
boast
with
reason
to
the
friends
who
visited
him
that
few
retired
captains
were
more
snugly
quartered
than
he
in
his
crib
in
shepherd
inn
there
were
three
rooms
below
the
office
where
strong
transacted
his
business
whatever
that
might
be
and
where
still
remained
the
desk
and
railings
of
the
departed
officials
who
had
preceded
him
and
the
chevalier
own
bedroom
and
and
a
private
stair
led
out
of
the
office
to
two
upper
apartments
the
one
occupied
by
colonel
altamont
and
the
other
serving
as
the
kitchen
of
the
establishment
and
the
bedroom
of
grady
the
attendant
these
rooms
were
on
a
level
with
the
apartments
of
our
friends
bows
and
costigan
next
door
at
no
and
by
reaching
over
the
communicating
leads
grady
could
command
the
which
bloomed
in
window
from
grady
kitchen
casement
often
came
odours
still
more
fragrant
the
three
old
soldiers
who
formed
the
garrison
of
no
were
all
skilled
in
the
culinary
art
grady
was
great
at
an
irish
stew
the
colonel
was
famous
for
pillaus
and
curries
and
as
for
strong
he
could
cook
anything
he
made
french
dishes
and
spanish
dishes
stews
fricassees
and
omelettes
to
perfection
nor
was
there
any
man
in
england
more
hospitable
than
he
when
his
purse
was
full
or
his
credit
was
good
at
those
happy
periods
he
could
give
a
friend
as
he
said
a
good
dinner
a
good
glass
of
wine
and
a
good
song
afterwards
and
poor
cos
often
heard
with
envy
the
roar
of
strong
choruses
and
the
musical
clinking
of
the
glasses
as
he
sate
in
his
own
room
so
far
removed
and
yet
so
near
to
those
festivities
it
was
not
expedient
to
invite
costigan
always
his
practice
of
inebriation
was
lamentable
and
he
bored
strong
guests
with
his
stories
when
sober
and
with
his
maudlin
tears
when
drunk
a
strange
and
motley
set
they
were
these
friends
of
the
chevalier
and
though
major
pendennis
would
not
much
have
relished
their
company
arthur
and
warrington
liked
it
not
a
little
and
pen
thought
it
as
amusing
as
the
society
of
the
finest
gentlemen
in
the
finest
houses
which
he
had
the
honour
to
frequent
there
was
a
history
about
every
man
of
the
set
they
seemed
all
to
have
had
their
tides
of
luck
and
bad
fortune
most
of
them
had
wonderful
schemes
and
speculations
in
their
pockets
and
plenty
for
making
rapid
and
extraordinary
fortunes
jack
holt
had
been
in
don
carlos
army
when
ned
strong
had
fought
on
the
other
side
and
was
now
organising
a
little
scheme
for
smuggling
tobacco
into
london
which
must
bring
thirty
thousand
a
year
to
any
man
who
would
advance
fifteen
hundred
just
to
bribe
the
last
officer
of

held
out
and
had

of

off

men
and

and
i
return
in
ten
months
to
take
my

by

and
to
buy
back
my
family

the
manager
of
the
tredyddlum
and
polwheedle
copper
mines
which
were
as
yet
under
water
besides
singing
as
good
a
second
as
any
professional
man
and
besides
the
tredyddlum
office
had
a
smyrna
sponge
company
and
a
little
quicksilver
operation
in
view
which
would
set
him
straight
with
the
world
yet
filby
had
been
everything
a
corporal
of
dragoons
a
and
for
converting
the
irish
an
actor
at
a
greenwich
in
front
of
which
his
father
attorney
found
him
when
the
old
gentleman
died
and
left
him
that
famous
property
from
which
he
got
no
rents
now
and
of
which
nobody
exactly
knew
the
situation
added
to
these
was
sir
francis
clavering
who
liked
their
society
though
he
did
not
much
add
to
its
amusements
by
his
convivial
powers
but
he
was
made
much
of
by
the
company
now
on
account
of
his
wealth
and
position
in
the
world
he
told
his
little
story
and
sang
his
little
song
or
two
with
great
affability
and
he
had
had
his
own
history
too
before
his
accession
to
good
fortune
and
had
seen
the
inside
of
more
prisons
than
one
and
written
his
name
on
many
a
stamped
paper
when
altamont
first
returned
from
paris
and
after
he
had
communicated
with
sir
francis
clavering
from
the
hotel
at
which
he
had
taken
up
his
quarters
and
which
he
had
reached
in
a
very
denuded
state
considering
the
wealth
of
diamonds
and
rubies
with
which
this
honest
man
was
entrusted
strong
was
sent
to
his
patron
by
the
baronet
paid
his
little
bill
at
the
inn
and
invited
him
to
come
and
sleep
for
a
night
or
two
at
the
chambers
where
he
subsequently
took
up
his
residence
to
negotiate
with
this
man
was
very
well
but
to
have
such
a
person
settled
in
his
rooms
and
to
be
constantly
burthened
with
such
society
did
not
suit
the
chevalier
taste
much
and
he
grumbled
not
a
little
to
his
principal
i
wish
you
would
put
this
bear
into
somebody
else
cage
he
said
to
clavering
the
fellow
no
gentleman
i
do
like
walking
with
him
he
dresses
himself
like
a
nigger
on
a
holiday
i
took
him
to
the
play
the
other
night
and
by
jove
sir
he
abused
the
actor
who
was
doing
the
part
of
villain
in
the
play
and
swore
at
him
so
that
the
people
in
the
boxes
wanted
to
turn
him
out
the
was
the
where
wallack
comes
in
wounded
you
know
and
dies
when
he
died
altamont
began
to
cry
like
a
child
and
said
it
was
a
d
d
shame
and
cried
and
swore
so
that
there
was
another
row
and
everybody
laughing
then
i
had
to
take
him
away
because
he
wanted
to
take
his
coat
off
to
one
fellow
who
laughed
at
him
and
bellowed
to
him
to
stand
up
like
a
who
is
he
where
the
deuce
does
he
come
from
you
had
best
tell
me
the
whole
story
frank
you
must
one
day
you
and
he
have
robbed
a
church
together
that
my
belief
you
had
better
get
it
off
your
mind
at
once
clavering
and
tell
me
what
this
altamont
is
and
what
hold
he
has
over
hang
him
i
wish
he
was
dead
was
the
baronet
only
reply
and
his
countenance
became
so
gloomy
that
strong
did
not
think
fit
to
question
his
patron
any
further
at
that
time
but
resolved
if
need
were
to
try
and
discover
for
himself
what
was
the
secret
tie
between
altamont
and
clavering
chapter
xliv
in
which
the
colonel
narrates
some
of
his
adventures
early
in
the
forenoon
of
the
day
after
the
dinner
in
grosvenor
place
at
which
colonel
altamont
had
chosen
to
appear
the
colonel
emerged
from
his
chamber
in
the
upper
story
at
shepherd
inn
and
entered
into
strong
where
the
chevalier
sate
in
his
with
the
newspaper
and
his
cigar
he
was
a
man
who
made
his
tent
comfortable
wherever
he
pitched
it
and
long
before
altamont
arrival
had
done
justice
to
a
copious
breakfast
of
fried
eggs
and
broiled
rashers
which
grady
had
prepared
secundum
artem
and
talkative
he
preferred
any
company
rather
than
none
and
though
he
had
not
the
least
liking
for
his
and
would
not
have
grieved
to
hear
that
the
accident
had
befallen
him
which
sir
francis
clavering
desired
so
fervently
yet
kept
on
fair
terms
with
him
he
had
seen
altamont
to
bed
with
great
friendliness
on
the
night
previous
and
taken
away
his
candle
for
fear
of
accidents
and
finding
a
empty
upon
which
he
had
counted
for
his
nocturnal
refreshment
had
drunk
a
glass
of
water
with
perfect
contentment
over
his
pipe
before
he
turned
into
his
own
crib
and
to
sleep
that
enjoyment
never
failed
him
he
had
always
an
easy
temper
a
faultless
digestion
and
a
rosy
cheek
and
whether
he
was
going
into
action
the
next
morning
or
to
prison
and
both
had
been
his
lot
in
the
camp
or
the
fleet
the
worthy
captain
snored
healthfully
through
the
night
and
woke
with
a
good
heart
and
appetite
for
the
struggles
or
difficulties
or
pleasures
of
the
day
the
first
act
of
colonel
altamont
was
to
bellow
to
grady
for
a
pint
of
pale
ale
the
which
he
first
poured
into
a
pewter
flagon
whence
he
transferred
it
to
his
own
lips
he
put
down
the
tankard
empty
drew
a
great
breath
wiped
his
mouth
in
his
the
difference
of
the
colour
of
his
beard
from
his
dyed
whiskers
had
long
struck
captain
strong
who
had
seen
too
that
his
hair
was
fair
under
his
black
wig
but
made
no
remarks
upon
these
circumstances
the
colonel
drew
a
great
breath
and
professed
himself
immensely
refreshed
by
his
draught
nothing
like
that
beer
he
remarked
when
the
coppers
are
hot
many
a
day
i
drunk
a
dozen
of
bass
at
calcutta
and
and
and
at
lucknow
i
suppose
strong
said
with
a
laugh
i
got
the
beer
for
you
on
purpose
knew
you
want
it
after
last
and
the
colonel
began
to
talk
about
his
adventures
of
the
preceding
evening
i
can
not
help
myself
the
colonel
said
beating
his
head
with
his
big
hand
i
a
madman
when
i
get
the
liquor
on
board
me
and
ai
fit
to
be
trusted
with
a
when
i
once
begin
i
ca
stop
till
i
emptied
it
and
when
i
swallowed
it
lord
knows
what
i
say
or
what
i
do
say
i
dined
at
home
here
quite
quiet
grady
gave
me
just
my
two
tumblers
and
i
intended
to
pass
the
evening
at
the
black
and
red
as
sober
as
a
parson
why
did
you
leave
that
confounded
of
hollands
out
of
the
cupboard
strong
grady
must
go
out
too
and
leave
me
the
kettle
for
tea
it
was
of
no
use
i
could
keep
away
from
it
washed
it
all
down
sir
by
jove
and
it
my
belief
i
had
some
more
too
afterwards
at
that
infernal
little
thieves
what
were
you
there
too
strong
asked
and
before
you
came
to
grosvenor
place
that
was
beginning
early
hours
to
be
drunk
and
cleared
out
before
nine
eh
but
so
it
was
yes
like
a
great
big
fool
i
must
go
there
and
found
the
fellows
dining
blackland
and
young
moss
and
two
or
three
more
of
the
thieves
if
we
gone
to
rouge
et
noir
i
must
have
won
but
we
try
the
black
and
red
no
hang
they
know
i
have
beat
at
that
i
must
have
beat
i
ca
help
beating
i
tell
you
but
they
was
too
cunnin
for
me
that
rascal
blackland
got
the
bones
out
and
we
played
hazard
on
the
and
i
dropped
all
the
money
i
had
from
you
in
the
morning
be
hanged
to
my
luck
it
was
that
that
set
me
wild
and
i
suppose
i
must
have
been
very
hot
about
the
head
for
i
went
off
thinking
to
get
some
more
money
from
clavering
i
recollect
and
then
and
then
i
do
much
remember
what
happened
till
i
woke
this
morning
and
heard
old
bows
at
no
playing
on
his
strong
mused
for
a
while
as
he
lighted
his
cigar
with
a
coal
i
should
like
to
know
how
you
always
draw
money
from
clavering
colonel
he
said
the
colonel
burst
out
with
a
laugh
ha
ha
he
owes
it
me
he
said
i
do
know
that
that
a
reason
with
frank
for
paying
strong
answered
he
owes
plenty
besides
well
he
gives
it
me
because
he
is
so
fond
of
me
the
other
said
with
the
same
grinning
sneer
he
loves
me
like
a
brother
you
know
he
does
no
he
do
well
perhaps
he
do
and
if
you
ask
me
no
questions
perhaps
i
tell
you
no
lies
captain
strong
put
that
in
your
pipe
and
smoke
it
my
but
i
give
up
that
confounded
the
colonel
continued
after
a
pause
i
must
give
it
up
or
it
be
the
ruin
of
it
makes
you
say
queer
things
said
the
captain
looking
altamont
hard
in
the
face
remember
what
you
said
last
night
at
clavering
say
what
did
i
say
asked
the
other
hastily
did
i
split
anything
dammy
strong
did
i
split
anything
ask
me
no
questions
and
i
will
tell
you
no
lies
the
chevalier
replied
on
his
part
strong
thought
of
the
words
altamont
had
used
and
his
abrupt
departure
from
the
baronet
and
house
as
soon
as
he
recognised
major
pendennis
or
captain
beak
as
he
called
the
major
but
strong
resolved
to
seek
an
explanation
of
these
words
otherwise
than
from
colonel
altamont
and
did
not
choose
to
recall
them
to
the
other
memory
no
he
said
then
you
did
split
as
you
call
it
colonel
it
was
only
a
trap
of
mine
to
see
if
i
could
make
you
speak
but
you
did
say
a
word
that
anybody
could
comprehend
you
were
too
far
gone
for
so
much
the
better
altamont
thought
and
heaved
a
great
sigh
as
if
relieved
strong
remarked
the
emotion
but
took
no
notice
and
the
other
being
in
a
communicative
mood
went
on
speaking
yes
i
own
to
my
faults
continued
the
colonel
there
is
some
things
i
ca
do
what
i
will
resist
a
bottle
of
brandy
a
box
of
dice
and
a
beautiful
woman
no
man
of
pluck
and
spirit
no
man
as
was
worth
his
salt
ever
could
as
i
know
of
there
hardly
a
country
in
the
world
in
which
them
three
ai
got
me
into
indeed
said
strong
yes
from
the
age
of
fifteen
when
i
ran
away
from
home
and
went
on
board
an
indiaman
till
now
when
i
fifty
year
old
pretty
nigh
them
women
have
always
been
my
ruin
why
it
was
one
of
and
with
such
black
eyes
and
jewels
on
her
neck
and
battens
and
ermine
like
a
duchess
i
tell
you
it
was
one
of
at
paris
that
swept
off
the
best
part
of
the
thousand
pound
as
i
went
off
with
did
i
ever
tell
you
of
it
well
i
do
mind
at
first
i
was
very
cautious
and
having
such
a
lot
of
money
kept
it
close
and
lived
like
a
gentleman
colonel
altamont
meurice
hotel
and
that
sort
of
thing
never
played
except
at
the
public
tables
and
won
more
than
i
lost
well
sir
there
was
a
chap
that
i
saw
at
the
hotel
and
the
palace
royal
too
a
regular
swell
fellow
with
white
kid
gloves
and
a
tuft
to
his
chin
his
name
was
as
i
made
acquaintance
with
somehow
and
he
asked
me
to
dinner
and
took
me
to
madame
the
countess
de
foljambe
soirees
such
a
woman
strong
such
an
eye
such
a
hand
at
the
pianner
lor
bless
you
she
sit
down
and
sing
to
you
and
gaze
at
you
until
she
warbled
your
soul
out
of
your
body
she
asked
me
to
go
to
her
evening
parties
every
toosday
and
did
i
take
and
give
her
dinners
at
the
restauranteur
that
all
but
i
had
a
run
of
luck
at
the
tables
and
it
was
not
in
the
dinners
and
that
poor
clavering
money
went
no
be
hanged
to
it
it
was
swept
off
in
another
way
one
night
at
the
countess
there
was
several
of
us
at
supper
the
honourable
deuceace
the
marky
de
la
tour
de
force
all
nobs
sir
and
the
height
of
fashion
when
we
had
supper
and
champagne
you
may
be
sure
in
plenty
and
then
some
of
that
confounded
brandy
i
would
have
it
i
would
it
go
on
at
it
the
countess
mixed
the
tumblers
of
punch
for
me
and
we
had
cards
as
well
as
grog
after
supper
and
i
played
and
drank
until
i
do
know
what
i
did
i
was
like
i
was
last
night
i
was
taken
away
and
put
to
bed
somehow
and
never
woke
until
the
next
day
to
a
roaring
headache
and
to
see
my
servant
who
said
the
honourable
deuceace
wanted
to
see
me
and
was
waiting
in
the
are
you
colonel
says
he
a
coming
into
my
bedroom
long
did
you
stay
last
night
after
i
went
away
the
play
was
getting
too
high
for
me
and
i
lost
enough
to
you
for
one
night
me
says
i
that
my
dear
feller
for
though
he
was
an
earl
son
we
was
as
familiar
as
you
and
me
how
that
my
dear
feller
says
i
and
he
tells
me
that
he
had
borrowed
thirty
louis
of
me
at
that
he
gave
me
an
for
it
the
night
before
which
i
put
into
my
before
he
left
the
room
i
takes
out
my
it
was
the
countess
as
worked
it
for
me
and
there
was
the
sure
enough
and
he
paid
me
thirty
louis
in
gold
down
upon
the
table
at
my
bedside
so
i
said
he
was
a
gentleman
and
asked
him
if
he
would
like
to
take
anything
when
my
servant
should
get
it
for
him
but
the
honourable
deuceace
do
drink
of
a
morning
and
he
went
away
to
some
business
which
he
said
he
had
presently
there
another
ring
at
my
outer
door
and
this
time
and
the
marky
that
comes
in
jour
marky
says
i
morning
no
headache
says
he
so
i
said
i
had
one
and
how
i
must
have
been
uncommon
queer
the
night
afore
but
they
both
declared
i
did
show
no
signs
of
having
had
too
much
but
took
my
liquor
as
grave
as
a
judge
says
the
marky
has
been
with
you
we
met
him
in
the
palais
royal
as
we
were
coming
from
breakfast
has
he
settled
with
you
get
it
while
you
can
he
a
slippery
card
and
as
he
won
three
ponies
of
bloundell
i
recommend
you
to
get
your
money
while
he
has
some
has
paid
me
says
i
i
knew
no
more
than
the
dead
that
he
owed
me
anything
and
do
remember
a
bit
about
lending
him
thirty
louis
the
marky
and
bloundell
looks
and
smiles
at
each
other
at
this
and
bloundell
says
you
are
a
queer
feller
no
man
could
have
supposed
from
your
manners
that
you
had
tasted
anything
stronger
than
tea
all
night
and
yet
you
forget
things
in
the
morning
come
come
tell
that
to
the
marines
my
friend
we
wo
have
it
at
any
price
efet
says
the
marky
twiddling
his
little
black
mustachios
in
the
and
making
a
lunge
or
two
as
he
used
to
do
at
the
he
was
a
wonder
at
the
and
i
seen
him
knock
down
the
image
fourteen
times
running
at
lepage
us
speak
of
affairs
colonel
you
understand
that
affairs
of
honour
are
best
settled
at
once
perhaps
it
wo
be
inconvenient
to
you
to
arrange
our
little
matters
of
last
night
little
matters
says
i
you
owe
me
any
money
marky
says
he
not
let
us
have
any
more
jesting
i
have
your
note
of
hand
for
three
hundred
and
forty
louis
la
voia
says
he
taking
out
a
paper
from
his
mine
for
two
hundred
and
ten
says
and
he
pulls
out
his
bit
of
paper
i
was
in
such
a
rage
of
wonder
at
this
that
i
sprang
out
of
bed
and
wrapped
my
round
me
you
come
here
to
make
a
fool
of
me
says
i
do
owe
you
two
hundred
or
two
thousand
or
two
louis
and
i
wo
pay
you
a
farthing
do
you
suppose
you
can
catch
me
with
your
notes
of
hand
i
laugh
at
and
at
you
and
i
believe
you
to
be
a
couple
couple
of
what
says
bloundell
of
course
are
aware
that
we
are
a
couple
of
men
of
honour
colonel
altamont
and
not
come
here
to
trifle
or
to
listen
to
abuse
from
you
you
will
either
pay
us
or
we
will
expose
you
as
a
cheat
and
chastise
you
as
a
cheat
too
says
bloundell
parbleu
says
the
marky
but
i
did
mind
him
for
i
could
have
thrown
the
little
fellow
out
of
the
window
but
it
was
different
with
bloundell
he
was
a
large
man
that
weighs
three
stone
more
than
me
and
stands
six
inches
higher
and
i
think
he
could
have
done
for
me
will
pay
or
monsieur
will
give
me
the
reason
why
i
believe
you
little
better
than
a
polisson
colonel
altamont
that
was
the
phrase
he
used
altamont
said
with
a
grin
and
i
got
plenty
more
of
this
language
from
the
two
fellows
and
was
in
the
thick
of
the
row
with
them
when
another
of
our
party
came
in
this
was
a
friend
of
mine
a
gent
i
had
met
at
boulogne
and
had
taken
to
the
countess
myself
and
as
he
had
played
at
all
on
the
previous
night
and
had
actually
warned
me
against
bloundell
and
the
others
i
told
the
story
to
him
and
so
did
the
other
two
am
very
sorry
says
he
would
go
on
playing
the
countess
entreated
you
to
discontinue
these
gentlemen
offered
repeatedly
to
stop
it
was
you
that
insisted
on
the
large
stakes
not
they
in
fact
he
charged
dead
against
me
and
when
the
two
others
went
away
he
told
me
how
the
marky
would
shoot
me
as
sure
as
my
name
was
was
what
it
is
left
the
countess
crying
too
said
he
hates
these
two
men
she
has
warned
you
repeatedly
against
them
which
she
actually
had
done
and
often
told
me
never
to
play
with
them
now
colonel
i
have
left
her
in
hysterics
almost
lest
there
should
be
any
quarrel
between
you
and
that
confounded
marky
should
put
a
bullet
through
your
head
it
my
belief
says
my
friend
that
woman
is
distractedly
in
love
with
you
you
think
so
says
i
upon
which
my
friend
told
me
how
she
had
actually
gone
down
on
her
knees
to
him
and
colonel
altamont
as
soon
as
i
was
dressed
i
went
and
called
upon
that
lovely
woman
she
gave
a
shriek
and
pretty
near
fainted
when
she
saw
me
she
called
me
ferdinand
i
blest
if
she
i
thought
your
name
was
jack
said
strong
with
a
laugh
at
which
the
colonel
blushed
very
much
behind
his
dyed
whiskers
a
man
may
have
more
names
than
one
may
he
strong
altamont
asked
when
i
with
a
lady
i
like
to
take
a
good
one
she
called
me
by
my
christian
name
she
cried
fit
to
break
your
heart
i
ca
stand
seeing
a
woman
cry
never
could
not
whilst
i
fond
of
her
she
said
she
could
bear
not
to
think
of
my
losing
so
much
money
in
her
house
would
i
take
her
diamonds
and
necklaces
and
pay
part
i
swore
i
would
touch
a
farthing
worth
of
her
jewellery
which
perhaps
i
did
not
think
was
worth
a
great
deal
but
what
can
a
woman
do
more
than
give
you
her
all
that
the
sort
i
like
and
i
know
plenty
of
and
i
told
her
to
be
easy
about
the
money
for
i
would
not
pay
one
single
farthing
they
shoot
you
says
she
kill
my
ferdinand
they
kill
my
jack
would
have
sounded
well
in
french
strong
said
laughing
never
mind
about
names
said
the
other
sulkily
a
man
of
honour
may
take
any
name
he
chooses
i
well
go
on
with
your
story
said
strong
she
said
they
would
kill
says
i
wo
for
i
will
not
let
that
scamp
of
a
marquis
send
me
out
of
the
world
and
if
he
lays
a
hand
on
me
i
brain
him
marquis
as
he
is
at
this
the
countess
shrank
back
from
me
as
if
i
had
said
something
very
shocking
i
understand
colonel
altamont
aright
says
she
that
a
british
officer
refuses
to
meet
any
person
who
provokes
him
to
the
field
of
honour
of
honour
be
hanged
countess
says
i
would
not
have
me
be
a
target
for
that
little
scoundrel
pistol
practice
altamont
says
the
countess
thought
you
were
a
man
of
honour
i
thought
i
but
no
matter
sir
and
she
was
sweeping
out
of
the
room
her
voice
regular
choking
in
her
says
i
rushing
after
her
and
seizing
her
hand
me
monsieur
le
colonel
says
she
shaking
me
off
father
was
a
general
of
the
grand
army
a
soldier
should
know
how
to
pay
all
his
debts
of
honour
what
could
i
do
everybody
was
against
me
caroline
said
i
had
lost
the
money
though
i
did
remember
a
syllable
about
the
business
i
had
taken
deuceace
money
too
but
then
it
was
because
he
offered
it
to
me
you
know
and
that
a
different
thing
every
one
of
these
chaps
was
a
man
of
fashion
and
honour
and
the
marky
and
the
countess
of
the
first
families
in
france
and
by
jove
sir
rather
than
offend
her
i
paid
the
money
up
five
hundred
and
sixty
gold
napoleons
by
jove
besides
three
hundred
which
i
lost
when
i
had
my
revenge
and
i
ca
tell
you
at
this
minute
whether
i
was
done
or
not
concluded
the
colonel
musing
sometimes
i
think
i
was
but
then
caroline
was
so
fond
of
me
that
woman
would
never
have
seen
me
done
never
i
sure
she
would
at
least
if
she
would
i
deceived
in
any
further
revelations
of
his
past
life
which
altamont
might
have
been
disposed
to
confide
to
his
honest
comrade
the
chevalier
were
interrupted
by
a
knocking
at
the
outer
door
of
their
chambers
which
when
opened
by
grady
the
servant
admitted
no
less
a
person
than
sir
francis
clavering
into
the
presence
of
the
two
worthies
the
governor
by
jove
cried
strong
regarding
the
arrival
of
his
patron
with
surprise
what
brought
you
here
growled
altamont
looking
sternly
from
under
his
heavy
eyebrows
at
the
baronet
no
good
i
and
indeed
good
very
seldom
brought
sir
francis
clavering
into
that
or
any
other
place
whenever
he
came
into
shepherd
inn
it
was
money
that
brought
the
unlucky
baronet
into
those
precincts
and
there
was
commonly
a
gentleman
of
the
world
in
waiting
for
him
at
strong
chambers
or
at
campion
below
and
a
question
of
bills
to
negotiate
or
to
renew
claverng
was
a
man
who
had
never
looked
his
debts
fairly
in
the
face
familiar
as
he
had
been
with
them
all
his
life
as
long
as
he
could
renew
a
bill
his
mind
was
easy
regarding
it
and
he
would
sign
almost
anything
for
provided
could
be
left
unmolested
he
was
a
man
whom
scarcely
any
amount
of
fortune
could
have
benefited
permanently
and
who
was
made
to
be
ruined
to
cheat
small
tradesmen
to
be
the
victim
of
astuter
sharpers
to
be
niggardly
and
reckless
and
as
destitute
of
honesty
as
the
people
who
cheated
him
and
a
dupe
chiefly
because
he
was
too
mean
to
be
a
successful
knave
he
had
told
more
lies
in
his
time
and
undergone
more
baseness
of
stratagem
in
order
to
stave
off
a
small
debt
or
to
swindle
a
poor
creditor
than
would
have
sufficed
to
make
a
fortune
for
a
braver
rogue
he
was
abject
and
a
shuffler
in
the
very
height
of
his
prosperity
had
he
been
a
crown
prince
he
could
not
have
been
more
weak
useless
dissolute
or
ungrateful
he
could
not
move
through
life
except
leaning
on
the
arm
of
somebody
and
yet
he
never
had
an
agent
but
he
mistrusted
him
and
marred
any
plans
which
might
be
arranged
for
his
benefit
and
secretly
acting
against
the
people
whom
he
employed
strong
knew
clavering
and
judged
him
quite
correctly
it
was
not
as
friends
that
this
pair
met
but
the
chevalier
worked
for
his
principal
as
he
would
when
in
the
army
have
pursued
a
harassing
march
or
undergone
his
part
in
the
danger
and
privations
of
a
siege
because
it
was
his
duty
and
because
he
had
agreed
to
it
what
is
it
he
wants
thought
the
officers
of
the
shepherd
inn
garrison
when
the
baronet
came
among
them
his
pale
face
expressed
extreme
anger
and
irritation
so
sir
he
said
addressing
altamont
you
been
at
your
old
which
of
asked
altamont
with
a
sneer
you
have
been
at
the
rouge
et
noir
you
were
there
last
night
cried
the
baronet
how
do
you
know
were
you
there
the
other
said
i
was
at
the
club
but
it
was
on
the
colours
i
played
ask
the
captain
i
been
telling
him
of
it
it
was
with
the
bones
it
was
at
hazard
sir
francis
upon
my
word
and
honour
it
was
and
he
looked
at
the
baronet
with
a
knowing
humorous
mock
humility
which
only
seemed
to
make
the
other
more
angry
what
the
deuce
do
i
care
sir
how
a
man
like
you
loses
his
money
and
whether
it
is
at
hazard
or
roulette
screamed
the
baronet
with
a
multiplicity
of
oaths
and
at
the
top
of
his
voice
what
i
will
not
have
sir
is
that
you
should
use
my
name
or
couple
it
with
damn
him
strong
why
do
you
keep
him
in
better
order
i
tell
you
he
has
gone
and
used
my
name
again
sir
drawn
a
bill
upon
me
and
lost
the
money
on
the
table
i
ca
stand
it
i
wo
stand
it
flesh
and
blood
wo
bear
it
do
you
know
how
much
i
have
paid
for
you
sir
this
was
only
a
very
little
sir
francis
only
fifteen
pound
captain
strong
they
would
stand
another
and
it
ought
to
anger
you
governor
why
it
so
trifling
i
did
not
even
mention
it
to
strong
did
i
now
captain
i
protest
it
had
quite
slipped
my
memory
and
all
on
account
of
that
confounded
liquor
i
liquor
or
no
liquor
sir
it
is
no
business
of
mine
i
do
care
what
you
drink
or
where
you
drink
it
only
it
sha
be
in
my
house
and
i
will
not
have
you
breaking
into
my
house
of
a
night
and
a
fellow
like
you
intruding
himself
on
my
company
how
dared
you
show
yourself
in
grosvenor
place
last
night
sir
and
and
what
do
you
suppose
my
friends
must
think
of
me
when
they
see
a
man
of
your
sort
walking
into
my
uninvited
and
drunk
and
calling
for
liquor
as
if
you
were
the
master
of
the
house
they
think
you
know
some
very
queer
sort
of
people
i
dare
say
altamont
said
with
impenetrable
look
here
baronet
i
apologise
on
my
honour
i
do
and
ai
an
apology
enough
between
two
gentlemen
it
was
a
strong
measure
i
own
walking
into
your
cuddy
and
calling
for
drink
as
if
i
was
the
captain
but
i
had
had
too
much
before
you
see
that
why
i
wanted
some
more
nothing
can
be
more
simple
and
it
was
because
they
would
give
me
no
more
money
upon
your
name
at
the
black
and
red
that
i
thought
i
would
come
down
and
speak
to
you
about
it
to
refuse
me
was
nothing
but
to
refuse
a
bill
drawn
on
you
that
have
been
such
a
friend
to
the
shop
and
are
a
baronet
and
a
member
of
parliament
and
a
gentleman
and
no
mistake
damme
its
by
heavens
if
ever
you
do
it
again
if
ever
you
dare
show
to
yourself
in
my
house
or
give
my
name
at
a
or
at
any
other
house
by
jove
at
any
other
house
or
give
any
reference
at
all
to
me
or
speak
to
me
in
the
street
by
god
or
anywhere
else
until
i
speak
to
you
i
disclaim
you
altogether
i
wo
give
you
another
governor

be
provoking
altamont
said
surlily
do
talk
to
me
about
daring
to
do
this
thing
or
or
when
my
dander
is
up
the
very
thing
to
urge
me
on
i
ought
to
have
come
last
night
i
know
i
ought
but
i
told
you
i
was
drunk
and
that
ought
to
be
sufficient
between
gentleman
and
you

gentleman

the
baronet

fellow
like
you
to
call
himself
a
gentleman

baronet

the
other
and

of

into
the
office
for
a
almost
all
clavering
assaults
ended
in
this
ignominious
way
and
in
a
shameful
retreat
altamont
sneered
after
the
baronet
as
he
left
the
room
and
entered
into
the
office
to
talk
privately
with
his
factotum
what
is
the
matter
now
the
latter
asked
of
him
it
the
old
story
i
d
it
yes
the
baronet
said
i
dropped
two
hundred
in
ready
money
at
the
little
coventry
last
night
and
gave
a
cheque
for
three
hundred
more
on
her
ladyship
bankers

for
and
i
must
meet
it
for
there
be
the
deuce
to
pay
else
the
last
time
she
paid
my
i
swore
i
would
not
touch
a
again
and
she
keep
her
word
strong
and
dissolve
partnership
if
i
go
on
i
wish
i
had
three
hundred
a
year
and
was
away
at
a
german
you
can
do
devilish
well
with
three
hundred
a
year
but
my
habits
are
so
d
i
wish
i
was
in
the
serpentine
i
wish
i
was
dead
by
gad
i
wish
i
was
i
wish
i
had
never
touched
those
confounded
bones
i
had
such
a
run
of
luck
last
night
with
five
for
the
main
and
seven
to
five
all
night
until
those
ruffians
wanted
to
pay
me
with
bill
upon
me
the
luck
turned
from
that
minute
never
held
the
box
again
for
three
mains
and
came
away
cleared
out
leaving
that
infernal
cheque
behind
me
how

it
blackland
wo
hold
it
over
hulker
and
bullock
will
write
about
it
directly
to
her
ladyship
by
jove
ned
the
most
miserable
brute
in
all
it
was
necessary
for
ned
to
devise
some
plan
to
console
the
baronet
under
this
pressure
of
grief
and
no
doubt
he
found
the
means
of
procuring
a
loan
for
his
patron
for
he
was
closeted
at
offices
that
day
for
some
time
altamont
had
once
more
a
guinea
or
two
in
his
pocket
with
a
promise
of
a
further
settlement
and
the
baronet
had
no
need
to
wish
himself
dead
for
the
next
two
or
three
months
at
least
and
strong
putting
together
what
he
had
learned
from
the
colonel
and
sir
francis
began
to
form
in
his
own
mind
a
pretty
accurate
opinion
as
to
the
nature
of
the
tie
which
bound
the
two
men
together
chapter
xlv
a
chapter
of
conversations
every
day
after
the
entertainment
at
grosvenor
place
and
greenwich
of
which
we
have
seen
major
pendennis
partake
the
worthy
friendship
and
cordiality
for
the
clavering
family
seemed
to
increase
his
calls
were
frequent
his
attentions
to
the
lady
of
the
house
unremitting
an
old
man
about
town
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
received
in
many
houses
at
which
a
lady
of
lady
clavering
distinction
ought
to
be
seen
would
her
ladyship
not
like
to
be
present
at
the
grand
entertainment
at
gaunt
house
there
was
to
be
a
very
pretty
breakfast
ball
at
viscount
marrowfat
at
fulham
everybody
was
to
be
there
including
august
personages
of
the
highest
rank
and
there
was
to
be
a
watteau
quadrille
in
which
miss
amory
would
surely
look
charming
to
these
and
other
amusements
the
obsequious
old
gentleman
kindly
offered
to
conduct
lady
clavering
and
was
also
ready
to
make
himself
useful
to
the
baronet
in
any
way
agreeable
to
the
latter
in
spite
of
his
present
station
and
fortune
the
world
persisted
in
looking
rather
coldly
upon
clavering
and
strange
suspicious
rumours
followed
him
about
he
was
blackballed
at
two
clubs
in
succession
in
the
house
of
commons
he
only
conversed
with
a
few
of
the
most
disreputable
members
of
that
famous
body
having
a
happy
knack
of
choosing
bad
society
and
adapting
himself
naturally
to
it
as
other
people
do
to
the
company
of
their
betters
the
name
all
the
senators
with
whom
clavering
consorted
would
be
invidious
we
may
mention
only
a
few
there
was
captain
raff
the
honourable
member
for
epsom
who
retired
after
the
last
goodwood
races
having
accepted
as
hotspur
the
whip
of
the
party
said
a
mission
to
the
levant
there
was
hustingson
the
patriotic
member
for
islington
whose
voice
is
never
heard
now
denunciating
corruption
since
his
appointment
to
the
governorship
of
coventry
island
there
was
bob
freeny
of
the
booterstown
freenys
who
is
a
dead
shot
and
of
whom
we
therefore
wish
to
speak
with
every
respect
and
of
all
these
gentlemen
with
whom
in
the
course
of
his
professional
duty
hotspur
had
to
confer
there
was
none
for
whom
he
had
a
more
thorough
contempt
and
dislike
than
for
sir
francis
clavering
the
representative
of
an
ancient
race
who
had
sat
for
their
own
borough
of
clavering
time
out
of
mind
in
the
house
if
that
man
is
wanted
for
a
division
hotspur
said
ten
to
one
he
is
to
be
found
in
a
hell
he
was
educated
in
the
fleet
and
he
has
not
heard
the
end
of
newgate
yet
take
my
word
for
it
he
muddle
away
the
begum
fortune
at
be
caught
picking
pockets
and
finish
on
board
the
and
if
the
hotspur
with
such
an
opinion
of
clavering
could
yet
from
professional
reasons
be
civil
to
him
why
should
not
major
pendennis
also
have
reasons
of
his
own
for
being
attentive
to
this
unlucky
gentleman
he
has
a
very
good
cellar
and
a
very
good
cook
the
major
said
as
long
as
he
is
silent
he
is
not
offensive
and
he
very
seldom
speaks
if
he
chooses
to
frequent
and
lose
his
money
to
blacklegs
what
matters
to
me
do
look
too
curiously
into
any
man
affairs
pen
my
boy
every
fellow
has
some
cupboard
in
his
house
begad
which
he
would
not
like
you
and
me
to
peep
into
why
should
we
try
when
the
rest
of
the
house
is
open
to
us
and
a
devilish
good
house
too
as
you
and
i
know
and
if
the
man
of
the
family
is
not
all
one
could
wish
the
women
are
excellent
the
begum
is
not
but
as
kind
a
woman
as
ever
lived
and
devilish
clever
too
and
as
for
the
little
blanche
you
know
my
opinion
about
her
you
rogue
you
know
my
belief
is
that
she
is
sweet
on
you
and
would
have
you
for
the
asking
but
you
are
growing
such
a
great
man
that
i
suppose
you
wo
be
content
under
a
daughter
hey
sir
i
recommend
you
to
ask
one
of
them
and
perhaps
pen
was
somewhat
intoxicated
by
his
success
in
the
world
and
it
may
also
have
entered
into
the
young
man
mind
his
uncle
perpetual
hints
serving
not
a
little
to
encourage
the
notion
that
miss
amory
was
tolerably
well
disposed
to
renew
the
little
flirtation
which
had
been
carried
on
in
the
early
days
of
both
of
them
by
the
banks
of
the
rural
brawl
but
he
was
little
disposed
to
marriage
he
said
at
that
moment
and
adopting
some
of
his
uncle
worldly
tone
spoke
rather
contemptuously
of
the
institution
and
in
favour
of
a
bachelor
life
you
are
very
happy
sir
said
he
and
you
get
on
very
well
alone
and
so
do
i
with
a
wife
at
my
side
i
should
lose
my
place
in
society
and
i
do
for
my
part
much
fancy
retiring
into
the
country
with
a
pendennis
or
taking
my
wife
into
lodgings
to
be
waited
upon
by
the
the
period
of
my
little
illusions
is
over
you
cured
me
of
my
first
love
who
certainly
was
a
fool
and
would
have
had
a
fool
for
her
husband
and
a
very
sulky
discontented
husband
too
if
she
had
taken
me
we
young
fellows
live
fast
sir
and
i
feel
as
old
at
as
many
of
the
old
fo
the
old
bachelors
whom
i
see
in
the
at
bays
do
look
offended
i
only
mean
that
i
am
blase
about
love
matters
and
that
i
could
no
more
fan
myself
into
a
flame
for
miss
amory
now
than
i
could
adore
lady
mirabel
over
again
i
wish
i
could
i
rather
like
old
mirabel
for
his
infatuation
about
her
and
think
his
passion
is
the
most
respectable
part
of
his
sir
charles
mirabel
was
always
a
theatrical
man
sir
the
major
said
annoyed
that
his
nephew
should
speak
flippantly
of
any
person
of
sir
charles
rank
and
station
he
has
been
occupied
with
theatricals
since
his
early
days
he
acted
at
carlton
house
when
he
was
page
to
the
prince
he
has
been
mixed
up
with
that
sort
of
thing
he
could
afford
to
marry
whom
he
chooses
and
lady
mirabel
is
a
most
respectable
woman
received
everywhere
everywhere
mind
the
duchess
of
connaught
receives
her
lady
rockminster
receives
her
it
does
become
young
fellows
to
speak
lightly
of
people
in
that
station
there
not
a
more
respectable
woman
in
england
than
lady
mirabel
and
the
old
fogies
as
you
call
them
at
bays
are
some
of
the
first
gentlemen
in
england
of
whom
you
youngsters
had
best
learn
a
little
manners
and
a
little
breeding
and
a
little
and
the
major
began
to
think
that
pen
was
growing
exceedingly
pert
and
conceited
and
that
the
world
made
a
great
deal
too
much
of
him
the
major
anger
amused
pen
he
studied
his
uncle
peculiarities
with
a
constant
relish
and
was
always
in
a
good
humour
with
his
worldly
old
mentor
i
am
a
youngster
of
fifteen
years
standing
sir
he
said
adroitly
and
if
you
think
that
we
are
disrespectful
you
should
see
those
of
the
present
generation
a
protege
of
yours
came
to
breakfast
with
me
the
other
day
you
told
me
to
ask
him
and
i
did
it
to
please
you
we
had
a
day
sights
together
and
dined
at
the
club
and
went
to
the
play
he
said
the
wine
at
the
polyanthus
was
not
so
good
as
wine
at
richmond
smoked
warrington
cavendish
after
breakfast
and
when
i
gave
him
a
sovereign
as
a
farewell
token
said
he
had
plenty
of
them
but
would
take
it
to
show
he
was
did
he
did
you
ask
young
clavering
cried
the
major
appeased
at
once
fine
boy
rather
wild
but
a
fine
boy
parents
like
that
sort
of
attention
and
you
ca
do
better
than
pay
it
to
our
worthy
friends
of
grosvenor
place
and
so
you
took
him
to
the
play
and
tipped
him
that
was
right
sir
that
was
right
with
which
mentor
quitted
telemachus
thinking
that
the
young
men
were
not
so
very
bad
and
that
he
should
make
something
of
that
fellow
yet
as
master
clavering
grew
into
years
and
stature
he
became
too
strong
for
the
authority
of
his
fond
parents
and
governess
and
rather
governed
them
than
permitted
himself
to
be
led
by
their
orders
with
his
papa
he
was
silent
and
sulky
seldom
making
his
appearance
however
in
the
neighbourhood
of
that
gentleman
with
his
mamma
he
roared
and
fought
when
any
contest
between
them
arose
as
to
the
gratification
of
his
appetite
or
other
wish
of
his
heart
and
in
his
disputes
with
his
governess
over
his
book
he
kicked
that
quiet
creature
shins
so
fiercely
that
she
was
entirely
overmastered
and
subdued
by
him
and
he
would
have
so
treated
his
sister
blanche
too
and
did
on
one
or
two
occasions
attempt
to
prevail
over
her
but
she
showed
an
immense
resolution
and
spirit
on
her
part
and
boxed
his
ears
so
soundly
that
he
forbore
from
molesting
miss
amory
as
he
did
the
governess
and
his
mamma
and
his
mamma
maid
at
length
when
the
family
came
to
london
sir
francis
gave
forth
his
opinion
that
the
little
beggar
had
best
be
sent
to
accordingly
the
young
son
and
heir
of
the
house
of
clavering
was
despatched
to
the
rev
otto
rose
establishment
at
twickenham
where
young
noblemen
and
gentlemen
were
received
preparatory
to
their
introduction
to
the
great
english
public
schools
it
is
not
our
intention
to
follow
master
clavering
in
his
scholastic
career
the
paths
to
the
temple
of
learning
were
made
more
easy
to
him
than
they
were
to
some
of
us
of
earlier
generations
he
advanced
towards
that
fane
in
a
so
to
speak
and
might
halt
and
take
refreshment
almost
whenever
he
pleased
he
wore
varnished
boots
from
the
earliest
period
of
youth
and
had
cambric
handkerchiefs
and
kid
gloves
of
the
smallest
size
ever
manufactured
by
privat
they
dressed
regularly
at
rose
to
come
down
to
dinner
the
young
gentlemen
had
shawl
fires
in
their
bedrooms
horse
and
carriage
exercise
occasionally
and
oil
for
their
hair
corporal
punishment
was
altogether
dispensed
with
by
the
principal
who
thought
that
moral
discipline
was
entirely
sufficient
to
lead
youth
and
the
boys
were
so
rapidly
advanced
in
many
branches
of
learning
that
they
acquired
the
art
of
drinking
spirits
and
smoking
cigars
even
before
they
were
old
enough
to
enter
a
public
school
young
frank
clavering
stole
his
father
havannahs
and
conveyed
them
to
school
or
smoked
them
in
the
stables
at
a
surprisingly
early
period
of
life
and
at
ten
years
old
drank
his
champagne
almost
as
stoutly
as
any
whiskered
cornet
of
dragoons
could
do
when
this
interesting
youth
came
home
for
his
vacations
major
pendennis
was
as
laboriously
civil
and
gracious
to
him
as
he
was
to
the
rest
of
the
family
although
the
boy
had
rather
a
contempt
for
old
wigsby
as
the
major
was
denominated
mimicked
him
behind
his
back
as
the
polite
major
bowed
and
smirked
with
lady
clavering
or
miss
amory
and
drew
rude
caricatures
such
as
are
designed
by
ingenious
youths
in
which
the
major
wig
his
nose
his
tie
were
represented
with
artless
exaggeration
untiring
in
his
efforts
to
be
agreeable
the
major
wished
that
pen
too
should
take
particular
notice
of
this
child
incited
arthur
to
invite
him
to
his
chambers
to
give
him
a
dinner
at
the
club
to
take
him
to
madame
tussaud
the
tower
the
play
and
so
forth
and
to
tip
him
as
the
phrase
is
at
the
end
of
the
day
pleastres
arthur
who
was
and
fond
of
children
went
through
all
these
ceremonies
one
day
had
the
boy
to
breakfast
at
the
temple
where
he
made
the
most
contemptuous
remarks
regarding
the
furniture
the
crockery
and
the
tattered
state
of
warrington
and
smoked
a
short
pipe
and
recounted
the
history
of
a
fight
between
tuffy
and
long
biggings
at
rose
greatly
to
the
edification
of
the
two
gentlemen
his
hosts
as
the
major
rightly
predicted
lady
clavering
was
very
grateful
for
arthur
attention
to
the
boy
more
grateful
than
the
lad
himself
who
took
attentions
as
a
matter
of
course
and
very
likely
had
more
sovereigns
in
his
pocket
than
poor
pen
who
generously
gave
him
one
of
his
own
slender
stock
of
those
coins
the
major
with
the
sharp
eyes
with
which
nature
endowed
him
and
with
the
glasses
of
age
and
experience
watched
this
boy
and
surveyed
his
position
in
the
family
without
seeming
to
be
rudely
curious
about
their
affairs
but
as
a
country
neighbour
one
who
had
many
family
obligations
to
the
claverings
an
old
man
of
the
world
he
took
occasion
to
find
out
what
lady
clavering
means
were
how
her
capital
was
disposed
and
what
the
boy
was
to
inherit
and
setting
himself
to
work
for
what
purposes
will
appear
no
doubt
ulteriorly
he
soon
had
got
a
pretty
accurate
knowledge
of
lady
clavering
affairs
and
fortune
and
of
the
prospects
of
her
daughter
and
son
the
daughter
was
to
have
but
a
slender
provision
the
bulk
of
the
property
was
as
before
has
been
said
to
go
to
the
son
his
father
did
not
care
for
him
or
anybody
else
his
mother
was
dotingly
fond
of
him
as
the
child
of
her
latter
days
his
sister
disliked
him
such
may
be
stated
in
round
numbers
to
be
the
result
of
the
information
which
major
pendennis
got
ah
my
dear
madam
he
would
say
patting
the
head
of
the
boy
this
boy
may
wear
a
baron
coronet
on
his
head
on
some
future
coronation
if
matters
are
but
managed
rightly
and
if
sir
francis
clavering
would
but
play
his
cards
at
this
the
widow
amory
heaved
a
deep
sigh
he
plays
only
much
of
his
cards
major
i
afraid
she
said
the
major
owned
that
he
knew
as
much
did
not
disguise
that
he
had
heard
of
sir
francis
unfortunate
propensity
to
play
pitied
lady
clavering
sincerely
but
spoke
with
such
genuine
sentiment
and
sense
that
her
ladyship
glad
to
find
a
person
of
experience
to
whom
she
could
confide
her
grief
and
her
condition
talked
about
them
pretty
unreservedly
to
major
pendennis
and
was
eager
to
have
his
advice
and
consolation
major
pendennis
became
the
begum
confidante
and
and
as
a
mother
a
wife
and
a
capitalist
she
consulted
him
he
gave
her
to
understand
showing
at
the
same
time
a
great
deal
of
respectful
sympathy
that
he
was
acquainted
with
some
of
the
circumstances
of
her
first
unfortunate
marriage
and
with
even
the
person
of
her
late
husband
whom
he
remembered
in
calcutta
when
she
was
living
in
seclusion
with
her
father
the
poor
lady
with
tears
of
shame
more
than
of
grief
in
her
eyes
told
her
version
of
her
story
going
back
a
child
to
india
after
two
years
at
a
european
school
she
had
met
amory
and
foolishly
married
him
oh
you
do
know
how
miserable
that
man
made
me
she
said
or
what
a
life
i
passed
betwixt
him
and
my
father
before
i
saw
him
i
had
never
seen
a
man
except
my
clerks
and
native
servants
you
know
we
did
go
into
society
in
india
on
account
of
i
know
said
major
pendennis
with
a
bow
i
was
a
wild
romantic
child
my
head
was
full
of
novels
which
i
read
at
school
i
listened
to
his
wild
stories
and
adventures
for
he
was
a
daring
fellow
and
i
thought
he
talked
beautifully
of
those
calm
nights
on
the
passage
out
when
he
used
to
well
i
married
him
and
i
was
wretched
from
that
day
wretched
with
my
father
whose
character
you
know
major
pendennis
and
i
wo
speak
of
but
he
was
a
good
man
sir
neither
to
my
poor
mother
nor
to
me
except
that
he
left
me
his
money
nor
to
no
one
else
that
i
ever
heard
of
and
he
did
do
many
kind
actions
in
his
lifetime
i
afraid
and
as
for
amory
he
was
almost
worse
he
was
a
spendthrift
when
my
father
was
close
he
drank
dreadfully
and
was
furious
when
in
that
way
he
was
in
any
way
a
good
or
a
faithful
husband
to
me
major
pendennis
and
if
he
died
in
the
gaol
before
this
trial
instead
of
afterwards
he
would
have
saved
me
a
deal
of
shame
and
of
unhappiness
since
lady
clavering
added
for
perhaps
i
should
not
have
married
at
all
if
i
had
not
been
so
anxious
to
change
his
horrid
name
and
i
have
not
been
happy
in
my
second
husband
as
i
suppose
you
know
sir
ah
major
pendennis
got
money
to
be
sure
and
i
a
lady
and
people
fancy
i
very
happy
but
i
ai
we
all
have
our
cares
and
griefs
and
troubles
and
the
day
that
i
sit
down
to
one
of
my
grand
dinners
with
an
aching
heart
and
many
a
night
do
i
lay
awake
on
my
fine
bed
a
great
deal
more
unhappy
than
the
maid
that
makes
for
it
i
not
a
happy
woman
major
for
all
the
world
says
and
envies
the
begum
her
diamonds
and
carriages
and
the
great
company
that
comes
to
my
house
i
not
happy
in
my
husband
i
not
in
my
daughter
she
ai
a
good
girl
like
that
dear
laura
bell
at
fairoaks
she
cost
me
many
a
tear
though
you
do
see
and
she
sneers
at
her
mother
because
i
have
had
learning
and
that
how
should
i
i
was
brought
up
amongst
natives
till
i
was
twelve
and
went
back
to
india
when
i
was
fourteen
ah
major
i
should
have
been
a
good
woman
if
i
had
had
a
good
husband
and
now
i
must
go
upstairs
and
wipe
my
eyes
for
they
red
with
cryin
and
lady
rockminster
a
comin
and
goin
to
ave
a
drive
in
the
park
and
when
lady
rockminster
made
her
appearance
there
was
not
a
trace
of
tears
or
vexation
on
lady
clavering
face
but
she
was
full
of
spirits
and
bounced
out
with
her
blunders
and
talk
and
murdered
the
king
english
with
the
utmost
liveliness
and
begad
she
is
not
such
a
bad
woman
the
major
thought
within
himself
she
is
not
refined
certainly
and
calls
but
she
has
some
heart
and
i
like
that
sort
of
thing
and
a
devilish
deal
of
money
too
three
stars
in
india
stock
to
her
name
begad
which
that
young
cub
is
to
have
is
he
and
he
thought
how
he
should
like
to
see
a
little
of
the
money
transferred
to
miss
blanche
and
better
still
one
of
those
stars
shining
in
the
name
of
arthur
pendennis
still
bent
upon
pursuing
his
schemes
whatsoever
they
might
be
the
old
negotiator
took
the
privilege
of
his
intimacy
and
age
to
talk
in
a
kindly
and
fatherly
manner
to
miss
blanche
when
he
found
occasion
to
see
her
alone
he
came
in
so
frequently
at
and
became
so
familiar
with
the
ladies
that
they
did
not
even
hesitate
to
quarrel
before
him
and
lady
clavering
whose
tongue
was
loud
and
temper
brusque
had
many
a
battle
with
the
sylphide
in
the
family
presence
blanche
wit
seldom
failed
to
have
the
mastery
in
these
encounters
and
the
keen
barbs
of
her
arrows
drove
her
adversary
discomfited
away
i
am
an
old
fellow
the
major
said
i
have
nothing
to
do
in
life
i
have
my
eyes
open
i
keep
good
counsel
i
am
the
friend
of
both
of
you
and
if
you
choose
to
quarrel
before
me
why
i
tell
any
one
but
you
are
two
good
people
and
i
intend
to
make
it
up
between
you
i
have
between
lots
of
people
husbands
and
wives
fathers
and
sons
daughters
and
mammas
before
this
i
like
it
i
nothing
else
to
one
day
then
the
old
diplomatist
entered
lady
just
as
the
latter
quitted
it
evidently
in
a
high
state
of
indignation
and
ran
past
him
up
the
stairs
to
her
own
apartments
she
could
speak
to
him
now
she
said
she
was
a
great
deal
too
angry
with
that
that
that
little
wicked
anger
choked
the
rest
of
the
words
or
prevented
their
utterance
until
lady
clavering
had
passed
out
of
hearing
my
dear
good
miss
amory
the
major
said
entering
the
i
see
what
is
happening
you
and
mamma
have
been
disagreeing
mothers
and
daughters
disagree
in
the
best
families
it
was
but
last
week
that
i
healed
up
a
quarrel
between
lady
clapperton
and
her
daughter
lady
claudia
lady
lear
and
her
eldest
daughter
have
not
spoken
for
fourteen
years
kinder
and
more
worthy
people
than
these
i
never
knew
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
for
everybody
but
each
other
admirable
but
they
ca
live
together
they
ought
to
live
together
and
i
wish
my
dear
creature
with
all
my
soul
that
i
could
see
you
with
an
establishment
of
your
own
for
there
is
no
woman
in
london
who
could
conduct
one
better
with
your
own
establishment
making
your
own
home
i
am
not
very
happy
in
this
one
said
the
sylphide
and
the
stupidity
of
mamma
is
enough
to
provoke
a
precisely
so
you
are
not
suited
to
one
another
your
mother
committed
one
fault
in
early
life
or
was
it
nature
my
dear
in
your
case
she
ought
not
to
have
educated
you
you
ought
not
to
have
been
bred
up
to
become
the
refined
and
intellectual
being
you
are
surrounded
as
i
own
you
are
by
those
who
have
not
your
genius
or
your
refinement
your
place
would
be
to
lead
in
the
most
brilliant
circles
not
to
follow
and
take
a
second
place
in
any
society
i
have
watched
you
miss
amory
you
are
ambitious
and
your
proper
sphere
is
command
you
ought
to
shine
and
you
never
can
in
this
house
i
know
it
i
hope
i
shall
see
you
in
another
and
a
happier
one
some
day
and
the
mistress
of
the
sylphide
shrugged
her
lily
shoulders
with
a
look
of
scorn
where
is
the
prince
and
where
is
the
palace
major
pendennis
she
said
i
am
ready
but
there
is
no
romance
in
the
world
now
no
real
no
indeed
said
the
major
with
the
most
sentimental
and
simple
air
which
he
could
muster
not
that
i
know
anything
about
it
said
blanche
casting
her
eyes
down
except
what
i
have
read
in
of
course
not
major
pendennis
cried
how
should
you
my
dear
young
lady
and
novels
ai
true
as
you
remark
admirably
and
there
is
no
romance
left
in
the
world
begad
i
wish
i
was
a
young
fellow
like
my
and
what
continued
miss
amory
musing
what
are
the
men
whom
we
see
about
at
the
balls
every
night
dancing
guardsmen
penniless
treasury
clerks
boobies
if
i
had
my
brother
fortune
i
might
have
such
an
establishment
as
you
promise
me
but
with
my
name
and
with
my
little
means
what
am
i
to
look
to
a
country
parson
or
a
barrister
in
a
street
near
russell
square
or
a
captain
in
a
dragoon
regiment
who
will
take
lodgings
for
me
and
come
home
from
the
mess
tipsy
and
smelling
of
smoke
like
sir
francis
clavering
that
is
how
we
girls
are
destined
to
end
life
o
major
pendennis
i
am
sick
of
london
and
of
balls
and
of
young
dandies
with
their
and
of
the
insolent
great
ladies
who
know
us
one
day
and
cut
us
the
next
and
of
the
world
altogether
i
should
like
to
leave
it
and
to
go
into
a
convent
that
i
should
i
shall
never
find
anybody
to
understand
me
and
i
live
here
as
much
alone
in
my
family
and
in
the
world
as
if
i
were
in
a
cell
locked
up
for
ever
i
wish
there
were
sisters
of
charity
here
and
that
i
could
be
one
and
catch
the
plague
and
die
of
it
i
wish
to
quit
the
world
i
am
not
very
old
but
i
am
tired
i
have
suffered
so
much
i
been
so
disillusionated
i
weary
i
weary
o
that
the
angel
of
death
would
come
and
beckon
me
away
this
speech
may
be
interpreted
as
follows
a
few
nights
since
a
great
lady
lady
flamingo
had
cut
miss
amory
and
lady
clavering
she
was
quite
mad
because
she
could
not
get
an
invitation
to
lady
drum
ball
it
was
the
end
of
the
season
and
nobody
had
proposed
to
her
she
had
made
no
sensation
at
all
she
who
was
so
much
cleverer
than
any
girl
of
the
year
and
of
the
young
ladies
forming
her
special
circle
dora
who
had
but
five
thousand
pounds
flora
who
had
nothing
and
leonora
who
had
red
hair
were
going
to
be
married
and
nobody
had
come
for
blanche
amory
you
judge
wisely
about
the
world
and
about
your
position
my
dear
miss
blanche
the
major
said
the
prince
do
marry
nowadays
as
you
say
unless
the
princess
has
a
doosid
deal
of
money
in
the
funds
or
is
a
lady
of
his
own
the
young
folks
of
the
great
families
marry
into
the
great
families
if
they
have
fortune
they
have
each
shoulders
to
push
on
in
the
world
which
is
pretty
nearly
as
a
girl
with
your
fortune
can
scarcely
hope
for
a
great
match
but
a
girl
with
your
genius
and
your
admirable
tact
and
fine
manners
with
a
clever
husband
by
her
side
may
make
any
place
for
herself
in
the
we
are
grown
doosid
republican
talent
ranks
with
birth
and
wealth
now
begad
and
a
clever
man
with
a
clever
wife
may
take
any
place
they
miss
amory
did
not
of
course
in
the
least
understand
what
major
pendennis
perhaps
she
thought
over
circumstances
in
her
mind
and
asked
herself
could
he
be
a
negotiator
for
a
former
suitor
of
hers
and
could
he
mean
pen
no
it
was
impossible
he
had
been
civil
but
nothing
so
she
said
laughing
who
is
the
clever
man
and
when
will
you
bring
him
to
me
major
pendennis
i
am
dying
to
see
at
this
moment
a
servant
threw
open
the
door
and
announced
henry
foker
at
which
name
and
at
the
appearance
of
our
friend
both
the
lady
and
the
gentleman
burst
out
laughing
that
is
not
the
man
major
pendennis
said
he
is
engaged
to
his
cousin
lord
gravesend
my
dear
miss
was
pen
growing
worldly
and
should
a
man
not
get
the
experience
of
the
world
and
lay
it
to
his
account
he
felt
for
his
part
as
he
said
that
he
was
growing
very
old
very
how
this
town
forms
and
changes
us
he
said
once
to
warrington
each
had
come
in
from
his
night
amusement
and
pen
was
smoking
his
pipe
and
recounting
as
his
habit
was
to
his
friend
the
observations
and
adventures
of
the
evening
just
past
how
i
am
changed
he
said
from
the
simpleton
boy
at
fairoaks
who
was
fit
to
break
his
heart
about
his
first
love
lady
mirabel
had
a
reception
and
was
as
grave
and
collected
as
if
she
had
been
born
a
duchess
and
had
never
seen
a
in
her
life
she
gave
me
the
honour
of
a
conversation
and
patronised
me
about
lorraine
quite
what
condescension
broke
in
warrington
was
it
pen
said
simply
at
which
the
other
burst
out
laughing
according
to
his
wont
is
it
possible
he
said
that
anybody
should
think
of
patronising
the
eminent
author
of
lorraine
you
laugh
at
both
of
us
pen
said
blushing
a
little
i
was
coming
to
that
myself
she
told
me
that
she
had
not
read
the
book
as
indeed
i
believe
she
never
read
a
book
in
her
life
but
that
lady
rockminster
had
and
that
the
duchess
of
connaught
pronounced
it
to
be
very
clever
in
that
case
i
said
i
should
die
happy
for
that
to
please
those
two
ladies
was
in
fact
the
great
aim
of
my
existence
and
having
their
approbation
of
course
i
need
look
for
no
other
lady
mirabel
looked
at
me
solemnly
out
of
her
fine
eyes
and
said
indeed
as
if
she
understood
me
and
then
she
asked
me
whether
i
went
to
the
thursdays
and
when
i
said
no
hoped
she
should
see
me
there
and
that
i
must
try
and
get
there
everybody
went
there
everybody
who
was
in
society
and
then
we
talked
of
the
new
ambassador
from
timbuctoo
and
how
he
was
better
than
the
old
one
and
how
lady
mary
billington
was
going
to
marry
a
clergyman
quite
below
her
in
rank
and
how
lord
and
lady
ringdove
had
fallen
out
three
months
after
their
marriage
about
tom
pouter
of
the
blues
lady
ringdove
cousin
and
so
forth
from
the
gravity
of
that
woman
you
would
have
fancied
she
had
been
born
in
a
palace
and
lived
all
the
seasons
of
her
life
in
belgrave
and
you
i
suppose
you
took
your
part
in
the
conversation
pretty
well
as
the
descendant
of
the
earl
your
father
and
the
heir
of
fairoaks
castle
warrington
said
yes
i
remember
reading
of
the
festivities
which
occurred
when
you
came
of
age
the
countess
gave
a
brilliant
tea
soiree
to
the
neighbouring
nobility
and
the
tenantry
were
regaled
in
the
kitchen
with
a
leg
of
mutton
and
a
quart
of
ale
the
remains
of
the
banquet
were
distributed
amongst
the
poor
of
the
village
and
the
entrance
to
the
park
was
illuminated
until
old
john
put
the
candle
out
on
retiring
to
rest
at
his
usual
my
mother
is
not
a
countess
said
pen
though
she
has
very
good
blood
in
her
veins
too
but
commoner
as
she
is
i
have
never
met
a
peeress
who
was
more
than
her
peer
george
and
if
you
will
come
to
fairoaks
castle
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
of
her
and
of
my
cousin
too
they
are
not
so
witty
as
the
london
women
but
they
certainly
are
as
well
bred
the
thoughts
of
women
in
the
country
are
turned
to
other
objects
than
those
which
occupy
your
london
ladies
in
the
country
a
woman
has
her
household
and
her
poor
her
long
calm
days
and
long
calm
devilish
long
warrington
said
and
a
great
deal
too
calm
i
tried
the
monotony
of
that
existence
must
be
to
a
certain
degree
melancholy
like
the
tune
of
a
long
ballad
and
its
harmony
grave
and
gentle
sad
and
tender
it
would
be
unendurable
else
the
loneliness
of
women
in
the
country
makes
them
of
necessity
soft
and
sentimental
leading
a
life
of
calm
duty
constant
routine
mystic
reverie
a
sort
of
nuns
at
large
too
much
gaiety
or
laughter
would
jar
upon
their
almost
sacred
quiet
and
would
be
as
out
of
place
there
as
in
a
where
you
go
to
sleep
over
the
sermon
warrington
said
you
are
a
professed
misogynist
and
hate
the
sex
because
i
suspect
you
know
very
little
about
them
mr
pen
continued
with
an
air
of
considerable
if
you
dislike
the
women
in
the
country
for
being
too
slow
surely
the
london
woman
ought
to
be
fast
enough
for
you
the
pace
of
london
life
is
enormous
how
do
people
last
at
it
i
wonder
male
and
female
take
a
woman
of
the
world
follow
her
course
through
the
season
one
asks
how
she
can
survive
it
or
if
she
tumbles
into
a
sleep
at
the
end
of
august
and
lies
torpid
until
the
spring
she
goes
into
the
world
every
night
and
sits
watching
her
marriageable
daughters
dancing
till
long
after
dawn
she
has
a
nursery
of
little
ones
very
likely
at
home
to
whom
she
administers
example
and
affection
having
an
eye
likewise
to
catechism
music
and
french
and
roast
leg
of
mutton
at
one
she
has
to
call
upon
ladies
of
her
own
station
either
domestically
or
in
her
public
character
in
which
she
sits
upon
charity
committees
or
ball
committees
or
emigration
committees
or
queen
college
committees
and
discharges
i
do
know
what
more
duties
of
british
stateswomanship
she
very
likely
keeps
a
list
has
conversations
with
the
clergyman
about
soup
or
flannel
or
proper
religious
teaching
for
the
parish
and
if
she
lives
in
certain
districts
probably
attends
early
church
she
has
the
newspapers
to
read
and
at
least
must
know
what
her
husband
party
is
about
so
as
to
be
able
to
talk
to
her
neighbour
at
dinner
and
it
is
a
fact
that
she
reads
every
new
book
that
comes
out
for
she
can
talk
and
very
smartly
and
well
about
them
all
and
you
see
them
all
upon
her
table
she
has
the
cares
of
her
household
besides
to
make
both
ends
meet
to
make
the
girls
bills
appear
not
too
dreadful
to
the
father
and
paymaster
of
the
family
to
snip
off
in
secret
a
little
extra
article
of
expenditure
here
and
there
and
convey
it
in
the
shape
of
a
to
the
boys
at
college
or
at
sea
to
check
the
encroachments
of
tradesmen
and
housekeepers
financial
fallacies
to
keep
upper
and
lower
servants
from
jangling
with
one
another
and
the
household
in
order
add
to
this
that
she
has
a
secret
taste
for
some
art
or
science
models
in
clay
makes
experiments
in
chemistry
or
plays
in
private
on
the
violoncello
and
i
say
without
exaggeration
many
london
ladies
are
doing
this
and
you
have
a
character
before
you
such
as
our
ancestors
never
heard
of
and
such
as
belongs
entirely
to
our
era
and
period
of
civilisation
ye
gods
how
rapidly
we
live
and
grow
in
nine
months
paxton
grows
you
a
pineapple
as
large
as
a
portmanteau
whereas
a
little
one
no
bigger
than
a
dutch
cheese
took
three
years
to
attain
his
majority
in
old
times
and
as
the
race
of
pineapples
so
is
the
race
of
man
hoiaper
what
the
greek
for
a
pineapple
warrington
stop
for
mercy
sake
stop
with
the
english
and
before
you
come
to
the
greek
warrington
cried
out
laughing
i
never
heard
you
make
such
a
long
speech
or
was
aware
that
you
had
penetrated
so
deeply
into
the
female
mysteries
who
taught
you
all
this
and
into
whose
boudoirs
and
nurseries
have
you
been
peeping
whilst
i
was
smoking
my
pipe
and
reading
my
book
lying
on
my
straw
bed
you
are
on
the
bank
old
boy
content
to
watch
the
waves
tossing
in
the
winds
and
the
struggles
of
others
at
sea
pen
said
i
am
in
the
stream
now
and
by
jove
i
like
it
how
rapidly
we
go
down
it
hey
strong
and
feeble
old
and
young
the
metal
pitchers
and
the
earthen
pitchers
the
pretty
little
china
boat
swims
gaily
till
the
big
bruised
brazen
one
bumps
him
and
sends
him
down
eh
vogue
la
galere
you
see
a
man
sink
in
the
race
and
say
to
him
look
he
has
only
dived
under
the
other
fellow
legs
and
comes
up
shaking
his
pole
and
striking
out
ever
so
far
ahead
eh
vogue
la
galere
i
say
it
good
sport
warrington
not
winning
merely
but
well
go
in
and
win
young
i
sit
and
mark
the
game
warrington
said
surveying
the
ardent
young
fellow
with
an
almost
fatherly
pleasure
a
generous
fellow
plays
for
the
play
a
sordid
one
for
the
stake
an
old
fogy
sits
by
and
smokes
the
pipe
of
tranquillity
while
jack
and
tom
are
pummelling
each
other
in
the
why
do
you
come
in
george

have
a

with
the

you
are

enough
pen
said
dear
old
boy
you
are
worth
ten
of
you
are
not
quite
as
tall
as
goliath
certainly
the
other
answered
with
a
laugh
that
was
rough
and
yet
tender
as
for
me
i
am
disabled
i
had
a
fatal
hit
in
early
life
i
will
tell
you
about
it
some
day
you
may
too
meet
with
your
master
do
be
too
eager
or
too
confident
or
too
worldly
my
was
pendennis
becoming
worldly
or
only
seeing
the
worldly
or
both
and
is
a
man
very
wrong
for
being
after
all
only
a
man
which
is
the
most
reasonable
and
does
his
duty
best
he
who
stands
aloof
from
the
struggle
of
life
calmly
contemplating
or
he
who
descends
to
the
ground
and
takes
his
part
in
the
contest
that
philosopher
pen
said
had
held
a
great
place
amongst
the
leaders
of
the
world
and
enjoyed
to
the
full
what
it
had
to
give
of
rank
and
riches
renown
and
pleasure
who
came
out
of
it
and
said
that
all
was
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
many
a
teacher
of
those
whom
we
reverence
and
who
steps
out
of
his
carriage
up
to
his
carved
cathedral
place
shakes
his
lawn
ruffles
over
the
velvet
cushions
and
cries
out
that
the
whole
struggle
is
an
accursed
one
and
the
works
of
the
world
are
evil
many
a
mystic
flies
from
it
altogether
and
shuts
himself
out
from
it
within
convent
walls
real
or
spiritual
whence
he
can
only
look
up
to
the
sky
and
contemplate
the

out
of
which
there
is
no

and
no

but
the

the

of
the

power

the
immeasurable
blue
yonder
in

the

chapter
xlvi
miss
amory
partners
the
noble
henry
foker
of
whom
we
have
lost
sight
for
a
few
pages
has
been
in
the
meanwhile
occupied
as
we
might
suppose
a
man
of
his
constancy
would
be
in
the
pursuit
and
indulgence
of
his
passion
of
love
i
wish
that
a
few
of
my
youthful
readers
who
are
inclined
to
that
amusement
would
take
the
trouble
to
calculate
the
time
which
is
spent
in
the
pursuit
when
they
would
find
it
to
be
one
of
the
most
costly
occupations
in
which
a
man
can
possibly
indulge
what
do
you
sacrifice
to
it
indeed
young
gentlemen
and
young
ladies
of
minds
many
hours
of
your
precious
sleep
in
the
first
place
in
which
you
lie
tossing
and
thinking
about
the
adored
object
whence
you
come
down
late
to
breakfast
when
noon
is
advancing
and
all
the
family
is
long
since
away
to
its
daily
occupations
then
when
you
at
length
get
to
these
occupations
you
pay
no
attention
to
them
and
engage
in
them
with
no
ardour
all
your
thoughts
and
powers
of
mind
being
fixed
elsewhere
then
the
day
work
being
slurred
over
you
neglect
your
friends
and
relatives
your
natural
companions
and
usual
associates
in
life
that
you
may
go
and
have
a
glance
at
the
dear
personage
or
a
look
up
at
her
windows
or
a
peep
at
her
carriage
in
the
park
then
at
night
the
artless
blandishments
of
home
bore
you
mamma
conversation
palls
upon
you
the
dishes
which
that
good
soul
prepares
for
the
dinner
of
her
favourite
are
sent
away
untasted
the
whole
meal
of
life
indeed
except
one
particular
plat
has
no
relish
life
business
family
ties
home
all
things
useful
and
dear
once
become
intolerable
and
you
are
never
easy
except
when
you
are
in
pursuit
of
your
flame
such
i
believe
to
be
not
unfrequently
the
state
of
mind
amongst
young
gentlemen
and
such
indeed
was
condition
who
having
been
bred
up
to
indulge
in
every
propensity
towards
which
he
was
inclined
abandoned
himself
to
this
one
with
his
usual
selfish
enthusiasm
nor
because
he
had
given
his
friend
arthur
pendennis
a
great
deal
of
good
advice
on
a
former
occasion
need
men
of
the
world
wonder
that
foker
became
passion
slave
in
his
turn
who
among
us
has
not
given
a
plenty
of
the
very
best
advice
to
his
friends
who
has
not
preached
and
who
has
practised
to
be
sure
you
madam
are
perhaps
a
perfect
being
and
never
had
a
wrong
thought
in
the
whole
course
of
your
frigid
and
irreproachable
existence
or
sir
you
are
a
great
deal
too
to
allow
any
foolish
passion
to
interfere
with
your
equanimity
in
chambers
or
your
attendance
on
you
are
so
strong
that
you
do
want
any
sympathy
we
do
give
you
any
then
we
keep
ours
for
the
humble
and
weak
that
struggle
and
stumble
and
get
up
again
and
so
march
with
the
rest
of
mortals
what
need
have
you
of
a
hand
who
never
fall
your
serene
virtue
is
never
shaded
by
passion
or
ruffled
by
temptation
or
darkened
by
remorse
compassion
would
be
impertinence
for
such
an
angel
but
then
with
such
a
one
companionship
becomes
intolerable
you
are
from
the
elevation
of
your
very
virtue
and
high
attributes
of
necessity
lonely
we
ca
reach
up
and
talk
familiarly
with
such
potentatess
then
our
way
lies
with
humble
folks
and
not
with
serene
highnesses
like
you
and
we
give
notice
that
there
are
no
perfect
characters
in
this
history
except
perhaps
one
little
one
and
that
one
is
not
perfect
either
for
she
never
knows
to
this
day
that
she
is
perfect
and
with
a
deplorable
misapprehension
and
perverseness
of
humility
believes
herself
to
be
as
great
a
sinner
as
need
be
this
young
person
does
not
happen
to
be
in
london
at
the
present
period
of
our
story
and
it
is
by
no
means
for
the
like
of
her
that
henry
foker
mind
is
agitated
but
what
matters
a
few
failings
need
we
be
angels
male
or
female
in
order
to
be
worshipped
as
such
let
us
admire
the
diversity
of
the
tastes
of
mankind
and
the
oldest
the
ugliest
the
stupidest
and
most
pompous
the
silliest
and
most
vapid
the
greatest
criminal
tyrant
booby
bluebeard
catherine
hayes
george
barnwell
amongst
us
we
need
never
despair
i
have
read
of
the
passion
of
a
transported
pickpocket
for
a
female
convict
each
of
them
advanced
in
age
being
repulsive
in
person
ignorant
quarrelsome
and
given
to
drink
that
was
as
magnificent
as
the
loves
of
cleopatra
and
antony
or
lancelot
and
guinever
the
passion
which
count
borulawski
the
polish
dwarf
inspired
in
the
bosom
of
the
most
beautiful
baroness
at
the
court
of
dresden
is
a
matter
with
which
we
are
all
of
us
acquainted
the
flame
which
burned
in
the
heart
of
young
cornet
tozer
but
the
other
day
and
caused
him
to
run
off
and
espouse
battersby
who
was
old
enough
to
be
his
mamma
all
these
instances
are
told
in
the
page
of
history
or
the
newspaper
column
are
we
to
be
ashamed
or
pleased
to
think
that
our
hearts
are
formed
so
that
the
biggest
and
ajax
among
us
may
some
day
find
himself
prostrate
before
the
pattens
of
his
as
that
there
is
no
poverty
or
shame
or
crime
which
will
not
be
supported
hugged
even
with
delight
and
cherished
more
closely
than
virtue
would
be
by
the
perverse
fidelity
and
admirable
constant
folly
of
a
woman
so
then
henry
foker
esquire
longed
after
his
love
and
cursed
the
fate
which
separated
him
from
her
when
lord
gravesend
family
retired
to
the
country
his
lordship
leaving
his
proxy
with
the
venerable
lord
bagwig
harry
still
remained
lingering
on
in
london
certainly
not
much
to
the
sorrow
of
lady
ann
to
whom
he
was
affianced
and
who
did
not
in
the
least
miss
him
wherever
miss
clavering
went
this
infatuated
young
fellow
continued
to
follow
her
and
being
aware
that
his
engagement
to
his
cousin
was
known
in
the
world
he
was
forced
to
make
a
mystery
of
his
passion
and
confine
it
to
his
own
breast
so
that
it
was
so
pent
in
there
and
pressed
down
that
it
is
a
wonder
he
did
not
explode
some
day
with
the
stormy
secret
and
perish
collapsed
after
the
outburst
there
had
been
a
grand
entertainment
at
gaunt
house
on
one
beautiful
evening
in
june
and
the
next
day
journals
contained
almost
two
columns
of
the
names
of
the
most
closely
printed
nobility
and
gentry
who
had
been
honoured
with
invitations
to
the
ball
among
the
guests
were
sir
francis
and
lady
clavering
and
miss
amory
for
whom
the
indefatigable
major
pendennis
had
procured
an
invitation
and
our
two
young
friends
arthur
and
harry
each
exerted
himself
and
danced
a
great
deal
with
miss
blanche
as
for
the
worthy
major
he
assumed
the
charge
of
lady
clavering
and
took
care
to
introduce
her
to
that
department
of
the
mansion
where
her
ladyship
specially
distinguished
herself
namely
the
where
amongst
pictures
of
titian
and
giorgione
and
regal
portraits
of
vandyke
and
reynolds
and
enormous
salvers
of
gold
and
silver
and
pyramids
of
large
flowers
and
constellations
of
wax
candles
in
a
manner
perfectly
regardless
of
expense
in
a
word
a
supper
was
going
on
all
night
of
how
many
creams
jellies
salads
peaches
white
soups
grapes
pates
galantines
cups
of
tea
champagne
and
so
forth
lady
clavering
partook
it
does
not
become
us
to
say
how
much
the
major
suffered
as
he
followed
the
honest
woman
about
calling
to
the
solemn
male
attendants
and
lovely
and
administering
to
lady
clavering
various
wants
with
admirable
patience
nobody
knows
he
never
confessed
he
never
allowed
his
agony
to
appear
on
his
countenance
in
the
least
but
with
a
constant
kindness
brought
plate
after
plate
to
the
begum
wagg
counted
up
all
the
dishes
of
which
lady
clavering
partook
as
long
as
he
could
count
but
as
he
partook
very
freely
himself
of
champagne
during
the
evening
his
powers
of
calculation
were
not
to
be
trusted
at
the
close
of
the
entertainment
and
he
recommended
honeyman
lady
steyne
medical
man
to
look
carefully
after
the
begum
and
to
call
and
get
news
of
her
ladyship
the
next
day
sir
francis
clavering
made
his
appearance
and
skulked
for
a
while
about
the
magnificent
rooms
but
the
company
and
the
splendour
which
he
met
there
were
not
to
the
baronet
taste
and
after
tossing
off
a
tumbler
of
wine
or
two
at
the
buffet
he
quitted
gaunt
house
for
the
neighbourhood
of
jermyn
street
where
his
friends
loder
punter
little
moss
abramns
and
captain
skewball
were
assembled
at
the
familiar
green
table
in
the
rattle
of
the
box
and
of
their
agreeable
conversation
sir
francis
spirits
rose
to
their
accustomed
point
of
feeble
hilarity
pynsent
who
had
asked
miss
amory
to
dance
came
up
on
one
occasion
to
claim
her
hand
but
scowls
of
recognition
having
already
passed
between
him
and
arthur
pendennis
in
the
arthur
suddenly
rose
up
and
claimed
miss
amory
as
his
partner
for
the
present
dance
on
which
pynsent
biting
his
lips
and
scowling
yet
more
savagely
withdrew
with
a
profound
bow
saying
that
he
gave
up
his
claim
there
are
some
men
who
are
always
falling
in
one
way
in
life
pynsent
and
pen
had
this
view
of
each
other
and
each
regarded
other
accordingly
what
a
confounded
conceited
provincial
fool
that
is
thought
the
one
because
he
has
written
a
twopenny
novel
his
absurd
head
is
turned
and
a
kicking
would
take
his
conceit
out
of
what
an
impertinent
idiot
that
man
is
remarked
the
other
to
his
partner
his
soul
is
in
downing
street
his
neckcloth
is
foolscap
his
hair
is
sand
his
legs
are
rulers
his
vitals
are
tape
and
he
was
a
prig
in
his
cradle
and
never
laughed
since
he
was
born
except
three
times
at
the
same
joke
of
his
chief
i
have
the
same
liking
for
that
man
miss
amory
i
have
for
that
cold
boiled
upon
which
blanche
of
course
remarked
that
pendennis
was
wicked
mechant
perfectly
abominable
and
wondered
what
he
would
say
when
her
back
was
turned
say
say
that
you
have
the
most
beautiful
figure
and
the
slimmest
waist
in
the
world
blanche
miss
amory
i
mean
i
beg
your
pardon
another
turn
this
music
would
make
an
alderman
and
you
have
left
off
tumbling
when
you
waltz
now
blanche
asked
archly
looking
up
at
her
partner
face
one
falls
and
one
gets
up
again
in
life
blanche
you
know
i
used
to
call
you
so
in
old
times
and
it
is
the
prettiest
name
in
the
world
besides
i
have
practised
since
and
with
a
great
number
of
partners
i
afraid
blanche
said
with
a
little
sham
sigh
and
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
and
so
in
truth
mr
pen
had
practised
a
good
deal
in
this
life
and
had
undoubtedly
arrived
at
being
able
to
dance
better
if
pendennis
was
impertinent
in
his
talk
foker
on
the
other
hand
so
bland
and
communicative
on
most
occasions
was
entirely
mum
and
melancholy
when
he
danced
with
miss
amory
to
clasp
her
slender
waist
was
a
rapture
to
whirl
round
the
room
with
her
was
a
delirium
but
to
speak
to
her
what
could
he
say
that
was
worthy
of
her
what
pearl
of
conversation
could
he
bring
that
was
fit
for
the
acceptance
of
such
a
queen
of
love
and
wit
as
blanche
it
was
she
who
made
the
talk
when
she
was
in
the
company
of
this
partner
it
was
she
who
asked
him
how
that
dear
little
pony
was
and
looked
at
him
and
thanked
him
with
such
a
tender
kindness
and
regret
and
refused
the
dear
little
pony
with
such
a
delicate
sigh
when
he
offered
it
i
have
nobody
to
ride
with
in
london
she
said
mamma
is
timid
and
her
figure
is
not
pretty
on
horseback
sir
francis
never
goes
out
with
me
he
loves
me
like
like
a
stepdaughter
oh
how
delightful
it
must
be
to
have
a
father
a
father
foker
oh
uncommon
said
harry
who
enjoyed
that
blessing
very
calmly
upon
which
and
forgetting
the
sentimental
air
which
she
had
just
before
assumed
blanche
grey
eyes
gazed
at
foker
with
such
an
arch
twinkle
that
both
of
them
burst
out
laughing
and
harry
enraptured
and
at
his
ease
began
to
entertain
her
with
a
variety
of
innocent
prattle
good
kind
simple
foker
talk
flavoured
with
many
expressions
by
no
means
to
be
discovered
in
dictionaries
and
relating
to
the
personal
history
of
himself
or
horses
or
other
things
dear
and
important
to
him
or
to
persons
in
the
ballroom
then
passing
before
them
and
about
whose
appearance
or
character
harry
spoke
with
artless
freedom
and
a
considerable
dash
of
humour
and
it
was
blanche
who
when
the
conversation
flagged
and
the
modesty
came
rushing
back
and
overpowering
him
knew
how
to
reanimate
her
companion
asked
him
questions
about
logwood
and
whether
it
was
a
pretty
place
whether
he
was
a
hunting
man
and
whether
he
liked
women
to
hunt
in
which
case
she
was
prepared
to
say
that
she
adored
hunting
but
foker
expressing
his
opinion
against
sporting
females
and
pointing
out
lady
bullfinch
who
happened
to
pass
by
as
a
whom
he
had
seen
at
cover
with
a
cigar
in
her
face
blanche
too
expressed
her
detestation
of
the
sports
of
the
field
and
said
it
would
make
her
shudder
to
think
of
a
dear
sweet
little
fox
being
killed
on
which
foker
laughed
and
waltzed
with
renewed
vigour
and
grace
and
at
the
end
of
the
waltz
the
last
waltz
they
had
on
that
night
blanche
asked
him
about
drummington
and
whether
it
was
a
fine
house
his
cousins
she
had
heard
were
very
accomplished
lord
erith
she
had
met
and
which
of
his
cousins
was
his
favourite
was
it
not
lady
ann
yes
she
was
sure
it
was
she
sure
by
his
looks
and
his
blushes
she
was
tired
of
dancing
it
was
getting
very
late
she
must
go
to
mamma
and
without
another
word
she
sprang
away
from
harry
arm
and
seized
upon
pen
who
was
swaggering
about
the
and
again
said
mamma
mamma
take
me
to
mamma
dear
pendennis
transfixing
harry
with
a
parthian
shot
as
she
fled
from
him
my
lord
steyne
with
garter
and
ribbon
with
a
bald
head
and
shining
eyes
and
a
collar
of
red
whiskers
round
his
face
always
looked
grand
upon
an
occasion
of
state
and
made
a
great
effect
upon
lady
clavering
when
he
introduced
himself
to
her
at
the
request
of
the
obsequious
major
pendennis
with
his
own
white
and
royal
hand
he
handed
to
her
ladyship
a
glass
of
wine
said
he
had
heard
of
her
charming
daughter
and
begged
to
be
presented
to
her
and
at
this
very
juncture
arthur
pendennis
came
up
with
the
young
lady
on
his
arm
the
peer
made
a
profound
bow
and
blanche
the
deepest
curtesy
that
ever
was
seen
his
lordship
gave
arthur
pendennis
his
hand
to
shake
said
he
had
read
his
book
which
was
very
wicked
and
clever
asked
miss
blanche
if
she
had
read
it
at
which
pen
blushed
and
winced
why
blanche
was
one
of
the
heroines
of
the
novel
blanche
in
black
ringlets
and
a
little
altered
was
the
neaera
of
lorraine
blanche
had
read
it
the
language
of
the
eyes
expressed
her
admiration
and
rapture
at
the
performance
this
little
play
being
achieved
the
marquis
of
steyne
made
other
two
profound
bows
to
lady
clavering
and
her
daughter
and
passed
on
to
some
other
of
his
guests
at
the
splendid
entertainment
mamma
and
daughter
were
loud
in
their
expressions
of
admiration
of
the
noble
marquis
so
soon
as
his
broad
back
was
turned
upon
them
he
said
they
make
a
very
nice
couple
whispered
major
pendennis
to
lady
clavering
did
he
now
really
mamma
thought
they
would
mamma
was
so
flustered
with
the
honour
which
had
just
been
shown
to
her
and
with
other
intoxicating
events
of
the
evening
that
her
knew
no
bounds
she
laughed
she
winked
and
nodded
knowingly
at
pen
she
tapped
him
on
the
arm
with
her
fan
she
tapped
blanche
she
tapped
the
major
her
contentment
was
boundless
and
her
method
of
showing
her
joy
equally
expansive
as
the
party
went
down
the
great
staircase
of
gaunt
house
the
morning
had
risen
stark
and
clear
over
the
black
trees
of
the
square
the
skies
were
tinged
with
pink
and
the
cheeks
of
some
of
the
people
at
the
ball
ah
how
ghastly
they
looked
that
admirable
and
devoted
major
above
all
who
had
been
for
hours
by
lady
clavering
side
ministering
to
her
and
feeding
her
body
with
everything
that
was
nice
and
her
ear
with
everything
that
was
sweet
and
flattering
oh
what
an
object
he
was
the
rings
round
his
eyes
were
of
the
colour
of
bistre
those
orbs
themselves
were
like
the
plovers
eggs
whereof
lady
clavering
and
blanche
had
each
tasted
the
wrinkles
in
his
old
face
were
furrowed
in
deep
gashes
and
a
silver
stubble
like
an
elderly
morning
dew
was
glittering
on
his
chin
and
alongside
the
dyed
whiskers
now
limp
and
out
of
curl
there
he
stood
with
admirable
patience
enduring
uncomplainingly
a
silent
agony
knowing
that
people
could
see
the
state
of
his
face
for
could
he
not
himself
perceive
the
condition
of
others
males
and
females
of
his
own
age
longing
to
go
to
rest
for
hours
past
aware
that
suppers
disagreed
with
him
and
yet
having
eaten
a
little
so
as
to
keep
his
friend
lady
clavering
in
with
twinges
of
rheumatism
in
the
back
and
knees
with
weary
feet
burning
in
his
varnished
boots
so
tired
oh
so
tired
and
longing
for
bed
if
a
man
struggling
with
hardship
and
bravely
overcoming
it
is
an
object
of
admiration
for
the
gods
that
power
in
whose
chapels
the
old
major
was
a
faithful
worshipper
must
have
looked
upwards
approvingly
upon
the
constancy
of
pendennis
martyrdom
there
are
sufferers
in
that
cause
as
in
the
other
the
negroes
in
the
service
of
mumbo
jumbo
tattoo
and
drill
themselves
with
burning
skewers
with
great
fortitude
and
we
read
that
the
priests
in
the
service
of
baal
gashed
themselves
and
bled
freely
you
who
can
smash
the
idols
do
so
with
a
good
courage
but
do
not
be
too
fierce
with
the
idolaters
they
worship
the
best
thing
they
know
the
pendennises
the
elder
and
the
younger
waited
with
lady
clavering
and
her
daughter
until
her
ladyship
carriage
was
announced
when
the
elder
martyrdom
may
be
said
to
have
come
to
an
end
for
the
begum
insisted
upon
leaving
him
at
his
door
in
bury
street
so
he
took
the
back
seat
of
the
carriage
after
a
feeble
bow
or
two
and
speech
of
thanks
polite
to
the
last
and
resolute
in
doing
his
duty
the
begum
waved
her
dumpy
little
hand
by
way
of
farewell
to
arthur
and
foker
and
blanche
smiled
languidly
out
upon
the
young
men
thinking
whether
she
looked
very
wan
and
green
under
her
hood
and
whether
it
was
the
mirrors
at
gaunt
house
or
the
fatigue
and
fever
of
her
own
eyes
which
made
her
fancy
herself
so
pale
arthur
perhaps
saw
quite
well
how
yellow
blanche
looked
but
did
not
attribute
that
peculiarity
of
her
complexion
to
the
effect
of
the
or
to
any
error
in
his
sight
or
her
own
our
young
man
of
the
world
could
use
his
eyes
very
keenly
and
could
see
face
pretty
much
as
nature
had
made
it
but
for
poor
foker
it
had
a
radiance
which
dazzled
and
blinded
him
he
could
see
no
more
faults
in
it
than
in
the
sun
which
was
now
flaring
over
the
amongst
other
wicked
london
habits
which
pen
had
acquired
the
moralist
will
remark
that
he
had
got
to
keep
very
bad
hours
and
often
was
going
to
bed
at
the
time
when
sober
were
thinking
of
leaving
it
men
get
used
to
one
hour
as
to
another
editors
of
newspapers
covent
garden
night
cabmen
and
and
gentlemen
and
ladies
of
fashion
who
frequent
balls
are
often
quite
lively
at
three
or
four
of
a
morning
when
ordinary
mortals
are
snoring
we
have
shown
in
the
last
chapter
how
pen
was
in
a
brisk
condition
of
mind
at
this
period
inclined
to
smoke
his
cigar
at
ease
and
to
speak
freely
foker
and
pen
walked
away
from
gaunt
house
then
indulging
in
both
the
above
amusements
or
rather
pen
talked
and
foker
looked
as
if
he
wanted
to
say
something
pen
was
sarcastic
and
dandified
when
he
had
been
in
the
company
of
great
folks
he
could
not
help
imitating
some
of
their
airs
and
tones
and
having
a
most
lively
imagination
mistook
himself
for
a
person
of
importance
very
easily
he
rattled
away
and
attacked
this
person
and
that
sneered
at
lady
john
turnbull
bad
french
which
her
ladyship
will
introduce
into
all
conversations
in
spite
of
the
sneers
of
everybody
at
mrs
slack
roper
extraordinary
costume
and
sham
jewels
at
the
old
dandies
and
the
young
ones
at
whom
did
he
sneer
and
laugh
you
fire
at
everybody
pen
you
grown
awful
that
you
are
foker
said
now
you
pulled
about
blondel
yellow
wig
and
black
one
why
do
you
have
a
shy
at
a
brown
one
hay
you
know
whose
i
mean
it
got
into
lady
clavering
under
my
uncle
hat
my
uncle
is
a
martyr
foker
my
boy
my
uncle
has
been
doing
excruciating
duties
all
night
he
likes
to
go
to
bed
rather
early
he
has
a
dreadful
headache
if
he
sits
up
and
touches
supper
he
always
has
the
gout
if
he
walks
or
stands
much
at
a
ball
he
has
been
sitting
up
and
standing
up
and
supping
he
has
gone
home
to
the
gout
and
the
headache
and
for
my
sake
shall
i
make
fun
of
the
old
boy
no
not
for
venice
how
do
you
mean
that
he
has
been
doing
it
for
your
sake
foker
asked
looking
rather
alarmed
boy
canst
thou
keep
a
secret
if
i
impart
it
to
thee
pen
cried
out
in
high
spirits

thou
of

thou
swear
wilt
thou
be
mum
or
wilt
thou
preach
wilt
thou
be
silent
and
hear
or
wilt
thou
speak
and
die
and
as
he
spoke
flinging
himself
into
an
absurd
theatrical
attitude
the
men
in
the
cabstand
in
piccadilly
wondered
and
grinned
at
the
antics
of
the
two
young
swells
what
the
doose
are
you
driving
at
foker
asked
looking
very
much
agitated
pen
however
did
not
remark
this
agitation
much
but

in
the
same
bantering
and
excited
vein

that
arthur

feels
that
he
is
growing
lonely
and
old
care
is
furrowing
his
temples
and
baldness
is
busy
with
his
crown

we
stop
and
have
a
drop
of
coffee
at

very
hot
and
nice
look

blowing
at
his

resume
my
tale

getting
on
in

i
have
got
devilish
little
money
i
want

i
am
thinking
of
getting
some
and
settling
in

i
thinking
of
settling

thinking
of
becoming
a
moral
man
a
steady
port
and
sherry
character
with
a
good
reputation
in
my
quartier
and
a
moderate
establishment
of
two
maids
and
a
man
with
an
occasional
brougham
to
drive
out

and
a
house
near
the
parks
for

accommodation
of

thou
worthy

i
adjure
thee
by
all
thy
vats
but
you

said
the

still
looking
alarmed
i
ai
no
but
she

i
tell
thee
there
is
gold
in
store
for
me
not
what
you
call
money
nursed
in
the
lap
of
luxury
and
cradled
on
grains
and
drinking
in
wealth
from
a
thousand
what
do
you
know
about
money
what
is
poverty
to
you
is
splendour
to
the
hardy
son
of
the
humble
apothecary
you
ca
live
without
an
establishment
and
your
houses
in
town
and
country
a
snug
little
house
somewhere
off
belgravia
a
brougham
for
my
wife
a
decent
cook
and
a
fair
bottle
of
wine
for
my
friends
at
home
sometimes
these
simple
necessaries
suffice
for
me
my
and
here
pendennis
began
to
look
more
serious
without
bantering
further
pen
continued
i
rather
serious
thoughts
of
settling
and
marrying
no
man
can
get
on
in
the
world
without
some
money
at
his
back
you
must
have
a
certain
stake
to
begin
with
before
you
can
go
in
and
play
the
great
game
who
knows
that
i
not
going
to
try
old
fellow
worse
men
than
i
have
won
at
it
and
as
i
have
not
got
enough
capital
from
my
fathers
i
must
get
some
by
my
wife
that
they
were
walking
down
grosvenor
street
as
they
talked
or
rather
as
pen
talked
in
the
selfish
fulness
of
his
heart
and
mr
pen
must
have
been
too
much
occupied
with
his
own
affairs
to
remark
the
concern
and
agitation
of
his
neighbour
for
he
continued
we
are
no
longer
children
you
know
you
and
i
harry
bah
the
time
of
our
romance
has
passed
away
we
do
marry
for
passion
but
for
prudence
and
for
establishment
what
do
you
take
your
cousin
for
because
she
is
a
nice
girl
and
an
earl
daughter
and
the
old
folks
wish
it
and
that
sort
of
and
you
pendennis
asked
foker
you
ai
very
fond
of
the
girl
you
going
to
marry
pen
shrugged
his
shoulders
comme
ca
said
he
i
like
her
well
enough
she
pretty
enough
she
clever
enough
i
think
she
do
very
well
and
she
has
got
money
enough
that
the
great
point
psha
you
know
who
she
is
do
you
i
thought
you
were
sweet
on
her
yourself
one
night
when
we
dined
with
her
mamma
it
little
i
i
thought
so
foker
said
and
has
she
accepted
you
not
quite
arthur
replied
with
a
confident
smile
which
seemed
to
say
i
have
but
to
ask
and
she
comes
to
me
that
instant
oh
not
quite
said
foker
and
he
broke
out
with
such
a
dreadful
laugh
that
pen
for
the
first
time
turned
his
thoughts
from
himself
towards
his
companion
and
was
struck
by
the
other
ghastly
pale
face
my
dear
fellow
fo
what
the
matter
you
ill
pen
said
in
a
tone
of
real
concern
you
think
it
was
the
champagne
at
gaunt
house
do
you
it
that
come
in
let
me
talk
to
you
for
a
minute
i
tell
you
what
it
is
d
it
let
me
tell
somebody
foker
said
they
were
at
foker
door
by
this
time
and
opening
it
harry
walked
with
his
friend
into
his
apartments
which
were
situated
in
the
back
part
of
the
house
and
behind
the
family
where
the
elder
foker
received
his
guests
surrounded
by
pictures
of
himself
his
wife
his
infant
son
on
a
donkey
and
the
late
earl
of
gravesend
in
his
robes
as
a
peer
foker
and
pen
passed
by
this
chamber
now
closed
with
shutters
and
entered
into
the
young
man
own
quarters
dusky
streams
of
sunbeams
were
playing
into
that
room
and
lighting
up
poor
harry
gallery
of
and
opera
nymphs
with
flickering
illuminations
look
here
i
ca
help
telling
you
pen
he
said
ever
since
the
night
we
dined
there
i
so
fond
of
that
girl
that
i
think
i
shall
die
if
i
do
get
her
i
feel
as
if
i
should
go
mad
sometimes
i
stand
it
pen
i
could
bear
to
hear
you
talking
about
her
just
now
about
marrying
her
only
because
she
money
ah
pen
that
ai
the
question
in
marrying
i
bet
anything
it
ai
talking
about
money
and
such
a
girl
as
that
it
it
d
you
know
what
i
mean
i
ai
good
at
talking
sacrilege
then
if
she
have
me
take
and
sweep
a
crossing
that
i
would
poor
fo
i
do
think
that
would
tempt
her
pen
said
eyeing
his
friend
with
a
great
deal
of
real
and
pity
she
is
not
a
girl
for
love
and
a
she
ought
to
be
a
duchess
i
know
that
very
well
and
i
know
she
would
take
me
unless
i
could
make
her
a
great
place
in
the
world
for
i
ai
good
for
anything
myself
much
i
ai
clever
and
that
sort
of
thing
foker
said
sadly
if
i
had
all
the
diamonds
that
all
the
duchesses
and
marchionesses
had
on
would
i
put
in
her
lap
but
what
the
use
of
talking
i
booked
for
another
race
that
kills
me
pen
i
ca
get
out
of
it
though
i
die
i
ca
get
out
of
it
and
though
my
cousin
a
nice
girl
and
i
like
her
very
well
and
that
yet
i
had
seen
this
one
when
our
governors
settled
that
matter
between
us
and
when
you
talked
just
now
about
her
doing
very
well
and
about
her
having
money
enough
for
both
of
you
i
thought
to
myself
it
is
money
or
mere
liking
a
girl
that
ought
to
be
enough
to
make
a
fellow
marry
he
may
marry
and
find
he
likes
somebody
else
better
all
the
money
in
the
world
wo
make
you
happy
then
look
at
me
plenty
of
money
or
shall
have
out
of
the
as
you
call
my
governor
thought
he
made
it
all
right
for
me
in
settling
my
marriage
with
my
cousin
i
tell
you
it
wo
do
and
when
lady
ann
has
got
her
husband
it
wo
be
happy
for
either
of
us
and
she
have
the
most
miserable
beggar
in
poor
old
fellow
pen
said
with
rather
a
cheap
magnanimity
i
wish
i
could
help
you
i
had
no
idea
of
this
and
that
you
were
so
wild
about
the
girl
do
you
think
she
would
have
you
without
your
money
no
do
you
think
your
father
would
agree
to
break
off
your
engagement
with
your
cousin
you
know
him
very
well
and
that
he
would
cast
you
off
rather
than
do
the
unhappy
foker
only
groaned
a
reply
flinging
himself
prostrate
on
a
sofa
face
forwards
his
head
in
his
hands
as
for
my
affair
pen
went
on
my
dear
fellow
if
i
had
thought
matters
were
so
critical
with
you
at
least
i
would
not
have
pained
you
by
choosing
you
as
my
confidant
and
my
business
is
not
serious
at
least
not
as
yet
i
have
not
spoken
a
word
about
it
to
miss
amory
very
likely
she
would
not
have
me
if
i
asked
her
only
i
have
had
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
it
with
my
uncle
who
says
that
the
match
might
be
an
eligible
one
for
me
i
ambitious
and
i
poor
and
it
appears
lady
clavering
will
give
her
a
good
deal
of
money
and
sir
francis
might
be
got
to
never
mind
the
rest
nothing
is
settled
harry
they
are
going
out
of
town
directly
i
promise
you
i
wo
ask
her
before
she
goes
there
no
hurry
there
time
for
everybody
but
suppose
you
got
her
foker
remember
what
you
said
about
marriages
just
now
and
the
misery
of
a
man
who
does
care
for
his
wife
and
what
sort
of
a
wife
would
you
have
who
did
care
for
her
husband
but
she
would
care
for
me
said
foker
from
his
sofa
that
is
i
think
she
would
last
night
only
as
we
were
dancing
she
said
what
did
she
say
pen
cried
starting
up
in
great
wrath
but
he
saw
his
own
meaning
more
clearly
than
foker
and
broke
off
with
a
laugh
well
never
mind
what
she
said
harry
miss
amory
is
a
clever
girl
and
says
numbers
of
civil
things
to
you
to
me
perhaps
and
who
the
deuce
knows
to
whom
besides
nothing
settled
old
boy
at
least
my
heart
wo
break
if
i
do
get
her
win
her
if
you
can
and
i
wish
you
joy
of
her
do
think
about
what
i
said
to
you
i
was
excited
and
confoundedly
thirsty
in
those
hot
rooms
and
did
i
suppose
put
enough
into
the
champagne
good
night
keep
your
counsel
too
is
the
word
between
us
and
there
be
a
fair
fight
and
let
the
best
man
win
as
peter
crawley
so
saying
arthur
pendennis
giving
a
very
queer
and
rather
dangerous
look
at
his
companion
shook
him
by
the
hand
with
something
of
that
sort
of
cordiality
which
befitted
his
just
repeated
simile
of
the
and
which
bendigo
displays
when
he
shakes
hands
with
gaunt
before
they
fight
each
other
for
the
champion
belt
and
two
hundred
pounds
a
side
foker
returned
his
friend
salute
with
an
imploring
look
and
a
piteous
squeeze
of
the
hand
sank
back
on
his
cushions
again
and
pen
putting
on
his
hat
strode
forth
into
the
air
and
almost
over
the
body
of
the
matutinal
housemaid
who
was
rubbing
the
steps
at
the
door
and
so
he
wants
her
too
does
be
thought
pen
as
he
marched
along
and
noted
within
himself
with
a
fatal
keenness
of
perception
and
almost
an
infernal
mischief
that
the
very
pains
and
tortures
which
that
honest
heart
of
foker
was
suffering
gave
a
zest
and
an
impetus
to
his
own
pursuit
of
blanche
if
pursuit
might
be
called
which
had
been
no
pursuit
as
yet
but
mere
sport
and
idle
dallying
she
said
something
to
him
did
she
perhaps
she
gave
him
the
fellow
flower
to
this
and
he
took
out
of
his
coat
and
twiddled
in
his
thumb
and
finger
a
poor
little
shrivelled
crumpled
bud
that
had
faded
and
blackened
with
the
heat
and
flare
of
the
night
i
wonder
to
how
many
more
she
has
given
her
artless
tokens
of
affection
the
little
flirt
and
he
flung
his
into
the
gutter
where
the
water
may
have
refreshed
it
and
where
any
amateur
of
rosebuds
may
have
picked
it
up
and
then
bethinking
him
that
the
day
was
quite
bright
and
that
the
by
might
be
staring
at
his
beard
and
white
neckcloth
our
modest
young
gentleman
took
a
cab
and
drove
to
the
temple
ah
is
this
the
boy
that
prayed
at
his
mother
knee
but
a
few
years
since
and
for
whom
very
likely
at
this
hour
of
morning
she
is
praying
is
this
jaded
and
selfish
worldling
the
lad
who
a
short
while
back
was
ready
to
fling
away
his
worldly
all
his
hope
his
ambition
his
chance
of
life
for
his
love
this
is
the
man
you
are
proud
of
old
pendennis
you
boast
of
having
formed
him
and
of
having
reasoned
him
out
of
his
absurd
romance
and
folly
and
groaning
in
your
bed
over
your
pains
and
rheumatisms
satisfy
yourself
still
by
thinking
that
at
last
that
lad
will
do
something
to
better
himself
in
life
and
that
the
pendennises
will
take
a
good
place
in
the
world
and
is
he
the
only
one
who
in
his
progress
through
this
dark
life
goes
wilfully
or
fatally
astray
whilst
the
natural
truth
and
love
which
should
illumine
him
grow
dim
in
the
poisoned
air
and
suffice
to
light
him
no
more
when
pen
was
gone
away
poor
harry
foker
got
up
from
the
sofa
and
taking
out
from
his
waistcoat
the
splendidly
buttoned
but
the
gorgeously
embroidered
the
work
of
his
mamma
a
little
white
rosebud
he
drew
from
his
also
the
maternal
present
a
pair
of
scissors
with
which
he
nipped
carefully
the
stalk
of
the
flower
and
placing
it
in
a
glass
of
water
opposite
his
bed
he
sought
refuge
there
from
care
and
bitter
remembrances
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
miss
blanche
amory
had
more
than
one
rose
in
her
bouquet
and
why
should
not
the
kind
young
creature
give
out
of
her
superfluity

chapter
xlvii
monseigneur
the
exertions
of
that
last
night
at
gaunt
house
had
proved
almost
too
much
for
major
pendennis
and
as
soon
as
he
could
move
his
weary
old
body
with
safety
he
transported
himself
groaning
to
buxton
and
sought
relief
in
the
healing
waters
of
that
place
parliament
broke
up
sir
francis
clavering
and
family
left

and
the
affairs
which
we
have
just
mentioned
to
the
reader
were
not
advanced
in
the
brief
interval
of
a
few
days
or
weeks
which
have
occurred
between
this
and
the
last
chapter
the
town
was
however
emptied
since
then
the
season
was
now
come
to
a
conclusion
pen
neighbours
the
lawyers
were
gone
upon
circuit
and
his
more
fashionable
friends
had
taken
their
passports
for
the
continent
or
had
fled
for
health
or
excitement
to
the
scotch
moors
scarce
a
man
was
to
be
seen
in
the
of
the
clubs
or
on
the
solitary
pall
mall
pavement
the
red
jackets
had
disappeared
from
before
the
the
tradesmen
of
were
abroad
taking
their
pleasure
the
tailors
had
grown
mustachios
and
were
gone
up
the
rhine
the
bootmakers
were
at
ems
or
baden
blushing

they

customers
at
those

their
creditors

a
congregation
in
which
there
was
not

distinction

shut
up
their
instruments
of

and

was
retained
in
town
by
his
arduous
duties
as
a
treasury
clerk
when
he
took
his
afternoon
ride
in
rotten
row
compared
its
loneliness
to
the
vastness
of
the
arabian
desert
and
himself
to
a
bedouin
wending
his
way
through
that
dusty
solitude

away

quantity
of

tobacco

betook
himself
as
his
custom
was
in
the
vacation
to
his
brother
house
in
norfolk
pen
was
left
alone
in
chambers
for
a
while
for
this
man
of
fashion
could
not
quit
the
metropolis
when
he
chose
always
and
was
at
present
detained
by
the
affairs
of
his
newspaper
the
pall
mall
gazette
of
which
he
acted
as
the
editor
and
charge
during
the
temporary
absence
of
the
chief
captain
shandon
who
was
with
his
family
at
the
salutary
of
although
as
we
have
seen
mr
pen
had
pronounced
himself
for
years
past
to
be
a
man
perfectly
blase
and
wearied
of
life
yet
the
truth
is
that
he
was
an
exceedingly
healthy
young
fellow
still
with
a
fine
appetite
which
he
satisfied
with
the
greatest
relish
and
satisfaction
at
least
once
a
day
and
a
constant
desire
for
society
which
showed
him
to
be
anything
but
misanthropical
if
he
could
not
get
a
good
dinner
he
sate
down
to
a
bad
one
with
perfect
contentment
if
he
could
not
procure
the
company
of
witty
or
great
or
beautiful
persons
he
put
up
with
any
society
that
came
to
hand
and
was
perfectly
satisfied
in
a
or
on
board
a
greenwich
steamboat
or
in
a
jaunt
to
hampstead
with
finucane
his
colleague
at
the
pall
mall
gazette
or
in
a
visit
to
the
summer
theatres
across
the
river
or
to
the
royal
gardens
of
vauxhall
where
he
was
on
terms
of
friendship
with
the
great
simpson
and
where
he
shook
the
principal
comic
singer
of
the
lovely
equestrian
of
the
arena
by
the
hand
and
while
he
could
watch
the
grimaces
or
the
graces
of
these
with
a
satiric
humour
that
was
not
deprived
of
sympathy
he
could
look
on
with
an
eye
of
kindness
at
the
too
at
the
roystering
youth
bent
upon
enjoyment
and
here
taking
it
at
the
honest
parents
with
their
delighted
children
laughing
and
clapping
their
hands
at
the
show
at
the
poor
outcasts
whose
laughter
was
less
innocent
though
perhaps
louder
and
who
brought
their
shame
and
their
youth
here
to
dance
and
be
merry
till
the
dawn
at
least
and
to
get
bread
and
drown
care
of
this
sympathy
with
all
conditions
of
men
arthur
often
boasted
said
he
was
pleased
to
possess
it
and
that
he
hoped
thus
to
the
last
he
should
retain
it
as
another
man
has
an
ardour
for
art
or
music
or
natural
science
mr
pen
said
that
anthropology
was
his
favourite
pursuit
and
had
his
eyes
always
eagerly
open
to
its
infinite
varieties
and
beauties
contemplating
with
an
unfailing
delight
all
specimens
of
it
in
all
places
to
which
he
resorted
whether
it
was
the
coquetting
of
a
wrinkled
dowager
in
a
ballroom
or
a
young
beauty
blushing
in
her
prime
there
whether
it
was
a
hulking
guardsman
coaxing
a
in
the
park
or
innocent
little
tommy
that
was
feeding
the
ducks
whilst
the
nurse
listened
and
indeed
a
man
whose
heart
is
pretty
clean
can
indulge
in
this
pursuit
with
an
enjoyment
that
never
ceases
and
is
only
perhaps
the
more
keen
because
it
is
secret
and
has
a
touch
of
sadness
in
it
because
he
is
of
his
mood
and
humour
lonely
and
apart
although
not
alone
yes
pen
used
to
brag
and
talk
in
his
impetuous
way
to
warrington
i
was
in
love
so
fiercely
in
my
youth
that
i
have
burned
out
that
flame
for
ever
i
think
and
if
ever
i
marry
it
will
be
a
marriage
of
reason
that
i
will
make
with
a
person
who
has
a
little
money
and
so
forth
that
will
cushion
our
carriage
in
its
course
through
life
as
for
romance
it
is
all
done
i
have
spent
that
out
and
am
old
before
my
time
i
proud
of
stuff
growled
the
other
you
fancied
you
were
getting
bald
the
other
day
and
bragged
about
it
as
you
do
about
everything
but
you
began
to
use
the
pot
directly
the
hairdresser
told
you
and
are
scented
like
a
barber
ever
you
are
diogenes
the
other
answered
and
you
want
every
man
to
live
in
a
tub
like
yourself
violets
smell
better
than
stale
tobacco
you
grizzly
old
but
mr
pen
was
blushing
whilst
he
made
this
reply
to
his
unromantical
friend
and
indeed
cared
a
great
deal
more
about
himself
still
than
such
a
philosopher
perhaps
should
have
done
indeed
considering
that
he
was
careless
about
the
world
mr
pen
ornamented
his
person
with
no
small
pains
in
order
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
it
and
for
a
weary
pilgrim
as
he
was
wore
very
tight
boots
and
bright
varnish
it
was
in
this
dull
season
of
the
year
then
of
a
shining
friday
night
in
autumn
that
pendennis
having
completed
at
his
newspaper
office
a
brilliant
leading
article
such
as
captain
shandon
himself
might
have
written
had
the
captain
been
in
and
inclined
to
work
which
he
never
would
do
except
under
compulsion
that
arthur
pendennis
having
written
his
article
and
reviewed
it
approvingly
as
it
lay
before
him
in
its
wet
at
the
office
of
the
paper
bethought
him
that
he
would
cross
the
water
and
regale
himself
with
the
fireworks
and
other
amusements
of
vauxhall
so
he
affably
put
in
his
pocket
the
order
which
admitted
editor
of
pall
mall
gazette
and
friend
to
that
place
of
recreation
and
paid
with
the
coin
of
the
realm
a
sufficient
sum
to
enable
him
to
cross
waterloo
bridge
the
walk
thence
to
the
gardens
was
pleasant
the
stars
were
shining
in
the
skies
above
looking
down
upon
the
royal
property
whence
the
rockets
and
roman
candles
had
not
yet
ascended
to
outshine
the
stars
before
you
enter
the
enchanted
ground
where
twenty
thousand
additional
lamps
are
burned
every
night
as
usual
most
of
us
have
passed
through
the
black
and
dreary
passage
and
wickets
which
hide
the
splendours
of
vauxhall
from
uninitiated
men
in
the
walls
of
this
passage
are
two
holes
strongly
illuminated
in
the
midst
of
which
you
see
two
gentlemen
at
desks
where
they
will
take
either
your
money
as
a
private
individual
or
your
order
of
admission
if
you
are
provided
with
that
passport
to
the
gardens
pen
went
to
exhibit
his
ticket
at
the
orifice
where
however
a
gentleman
and
two
ladies
were
already
in
parley
before
him
the
gentleman
whose
hat
was
very
much
on
one
side
and
who
wore
a
short
and
shabby
cloak
in
an
excessively
smart
manner
was
crying
out
in
a
voice
which
pen
at
once
recognised
bedad
sir
if
ye
doubt
me
honour
will
ye
obleege
me

in

and

the
said
on
which
the
captain
swore
an
oath
and
the
elder
lady
said
lor
ow
provokin
as
for
the
young
one
she
looked
up
at
the
captain
and
said
never
mind
captain
costigan
i
sure
i
do
want
to
go
at
all
come
away
and
with
this
although
she
did
not
want
to
go
at
all
her
feelings
overcame
her
and
she
began
to
cry
me
poor
child
the
captain
said
can
ye
see
that
sir
and
will
ye
not
let
this
innocent
creature
in
it
ai
my
business
cried
the
doorkeeper
peevishly
out
of
the
illuminated
box
and
at
this
minute
arthur
came
up
and
recognising
costigan
said
do
you
know
me
captain
pendennis
and
he
took
off
his
hat
and
made
a
bow
to
the
two
ladies
me
dear
boy
me
dear
friend
cried
the
captain
extending
towards
pendennis
the
grasp
of
friendship
and
he
rapidly
explained
to
the
other
what
he
called
a
most
unluckee
he
had
an
order
for
vauxhall
admitting
two
from
hodgen
then
within
the
gardens
and
singing
as
he
did
at
the
back
kitchen
and
the
nobility
concerts
the
snatcher
the
of
general
wolfe
the
of
blood
and
other
favourite
melodies
and
having
this
order
for
the
admission
of
two
persons
he
thought
that
it
would
admit
three
and
had
come
accordingly
to
the
gardens
with
his
friends
but
on
his
way
captain
costigan
had
lost
the
paper
of
admission
it
was
not
forthcoming
at
all
and
the
leedies
must
go
back
again
to
the
great
disappointment
of
one
of
them
as
pendennis
saw
arthur
had
a
great
deal
of
for
everybody
and
sympathised
with
the
misfortunes
of
all
sorts
of
people
how
could
he
refuse
his
sympathy
in
such
a
case
as
this
he
had
seen
the
innocent
face
as
it
looked
up
to
the
captain
the
appealing
look
of
the
girl
the
piteous
quiver
of
the
mouth
and
the
final
outburst
of
tears
if
it
had
been
his
last
guinea
in
the
world
he
must
have
paid
it
to
have
given
the
poor
little
thing
pleasure
she
turned
the
sad
imploring
eyes
away
directly
they
lighted
upon
a
stranger
and
began
to
wipe
them
with
her
handkerchief
arthur
looked
very
handsome
and
kind
as
he
stood
before
the
women
with
his
hat
off
blushing
bowing
generous
a
gentleman
who
are
they
he
asked
of
himself
he
thought
he
had
seen
the
elder
lady
before
if
i
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
captain
costigan
the
young
man
said
i
hope
you
will
command
me
is
there
any
difficulty
about
taking
these
ladies
into
the
garden
will
you
kindly
make
use
of
my
purse
and
and
i
have
a
ticket
myself
which
will
admit
two
i
hope
you
will
permit
me
the
first
impulse
of
the
prince
of
fairoaks
was
to
pay
for
the
whole
party
and
to
make
away
with
his
newspaper
order
as
poor
costigan
had
done
with
his
own
ticket
but
his
instinct
and
the
appearance
of
the
two
women
told
him
that
they
would
be
better
pleased
if
he
did
not
give
himself
the
airs
of
a
grand
seigneur
and
he
handed
his
purse
to
costigan
and
laughingly
pulled
out
his
ticket
with
one
hand
as
he
offered
the
other
to
the
elder
of
the
ladies
ladies
was
not
the
word
they
had
bonnets
and
shawls
and
collars
and
ribbons
and
the
youngest
showed
a
pretty
little
foot
and
boot
under
her
modest
grey
gown
but
his
highness
of
fairoaks
was
courteous
to
every
person
who
wore
a
petticoat
whatever
its
texture
was
and
the
humbler
the
wearer
only
the
more
stately
and
polite
in
his
demeanour
fanny
take
the
gentleman
arm
the
elder
said
since
you
will
be
so
very
kind
i
seen
you
often
come
in
at
our
gate
sir
and
go
in
to
captain
strong
at
no
fanny
made
a
little
curtsey
and
put
her
hand
under
arthur
arm
it
had
on
a
shabby
little
glove
but
it
was
pretty
and
small
she
was
not
a
child
but
she
was
scarcely
a
woman
as
yet
her
tears
had
dried
up
and
her
cheek
mantled
with
youthful
blushes
and
her
eyes
glistened
with
pleasure
and
gratitude
as
she
looked
up
into
arthur
kind
face
arthur
in
a
protecting
way
put
his
other
hand
upon
the
little
one
resting
on
his
arm
fanny
a
very
pretty
little
name
he
said
and
so
you
know
me
do
you
we
keep
the
lodge
sir
at
shepherd
inn
fanny
said
with
a
curtsey
and
i
never
been
at
vauxhall
sir
and
papa
did
like
me
to
go
and
and
o
o
law
how
beautiful
she
shrank
back
as
she
spoke
starting
with
wonder
and
delight
as
she
saw
the
royal
gardens
blaze
before
her
with
a
hundred
million
of
lamps
with
a
splendour
such
as
the
finest
fairy
tale
the
finest
pantomime
she
had
ever
witnessed
at
the
theatre
had
never
realised
pen
was
pleased
with
her
pleasure
and
pressed
to
his
side
the
little
hand
which
clung
so
kindly
to
him
what
would
i
not
give
for
a
little
of
this
pleasure

daughtther
will
thank
ye
simpson
your
humble
servant
if
pen
was
magnificent
in
his
courtesy
to
the
ladies
what
was
his
splendour
in
comparison
to
captain
costigan
bowing
here
and
there
and
crying
bravo
to
the
singers
a
man
descended
like
costigan
from
a
long
line
of
hibernian
kings
chieftains
and
other
magnates
and
sheriffs
of
the
county
had
of
course
too
much
dignity
and
to
walk
as
the
captain
phrased
it
with
a
lady
who
occasionally
swept
his
room
out
and
cooked
his
in
the
course
of
their
journey
from
shepherd
inn
to
vauxhall
gardens
captain
costigan
had
walked
by
the
side
of
the
two
ladies
in
a
patronising
and
affable
manner
pointing
out
to
them
the
edifices
worthy
of
note
and
discoorsing
according
to
his
wont
about
other
cities
and
countries
which
he
had
visited
and
the
people
of
rank
and
fashion
with
whom
he
had
the
honour
of
an
acquaintance
nor
could
it
be
expected
nor
indeed
did
bolton
expect
that
arrived
in
the
royal
property
and
strongly
illuminated
by
the
flare
of
the
twenty
thousand
additional
lamps
the
captain
could
relax
from
his
dignity
and
give
an
arm
to
a
lady
who
was
in
fact
little
better
than
a
housekeeper
or
charwoman
but
pen
on
his
part
had
no
such
scruples
miss
fanny
bolton
did
not
make
his
bed
nor
sweep
his
chambers
and
he
did
not
choose
to
let
go
his
pretty
little
partner
as
for
fanny
her
colour
heightened
and
her
bright
eyes
shone
the
brighter
with
pleasure
as
she
leaned
for
protection
on
the
arm
of
such
a
fine
gentleman
as
mr
pen
and
she
looked
at
numbers
of
other
ladies
in
the
place
and
at
scores
of
other
gentlemen
under
whose
protection
they
were
walking
here
and
there
and
she
thought
that
her
gentleman
was
handsomer
and
than
any
other
gent
in
the
place
of
course
there
were
votaries
of
pleasure
of
all
ranks
there
rakish
young
surgeons
fast
young
clerks
and
commercialists
occasional
dandies
of
the
guard
regiments
and
the
rest
old
lord
colchicum
was
there
in
attendance
upon
mademoiselle
caracoline
who
had
been
riding
in
the
ring
and
who
talked
her
native
french
very
loud
and
used
idiomatic
expressions
of
exceeding
strength
as
she
walked
about
leaning
on
the
arm
of
his
lordship
colchicum
was
in
attendance
upon
mademoiselle
carandine
little
tom
tufthunt
was
in
attendance
upon
lord
colchicum
and
rather
pleased
too
with
his
position
when
don
juan
scalles
the
wall
there
never
a
want
of
a
leporello
to
hold
the
ladder
tom
tufthunt
was
quite
happy
to
act
as
friend
to
the
elderly
viscount
and
to
carve
the
fowl
and
to
make
the
salad
at
supper
when
pen
and
his
young
lady
met
the
party
that
noble
poor
only
gave
arthur
a
passing
leer
of
recognition
as
his
lordship
eyes
passed
from
pen
face
under
the
bonnet
of
companion
but
tom
tufthunt
wagged
his
head
very
at
arthur
and
said
how
are
you
old
boy
and
looked
extremely
knowing
at
the
godfather
of
this
history
that
is
the
great
rider
at
astley
i
have
seen
her
there
miss
bolton
said
looking
after
mademoiselle
caracoline
and
who
is
that
old
man
is
it
not
the
gentleman
in
the
ring
that
is
lord
viscount
colchicum
miss
fanny
said
pen
with
an
air
of
protection
he
meant
no
harm
he
was
pleased
to
patronise
the
young
girl
and
he
was
not
displeased
that
she
should
be
so
pretty
and
that
she
should
be
hanging
upon
his
arm
and
that
yonder
elderly
don
juan
should
have
seen
her
there
fanny
was
very
pretty
her
eyes
were
dark
and
brilliant
her
teeth
were
like
little
pearls
her
mouth
was
almost
as
red
as
mademoiselle
caracoline
when
the
latter
had
put
on
her
vermilion
and
what
a
difference
there
was
between
the
one
voice
and
the
other
between
the
girl
laugh
and
the
woman
it
was
only
very
lately
indeed
that
fanny
when
looking
in
the
little
glass
over
the
mantelpiece
as
she
was
dusting
it
had
begun
to
suspect
that
she
was
a
beauty
but
a
year
ago
she
was
a
clumsy
gawky
girl
at
whom
her
father
sneered
and
of
whom
the
girls
at
the
miss
minifer
newcastle
street
strand
miss
the
younger
sister
took
the
leading
business
at
the
norwich
circuit
in
and
she
herself
had
played
for
two
seasons
with
some
credit
until
she
fell
down
a
and
broke
her
leg
the
girls
at
fanny
school
we
say
took
no
account
of
her
and
thought
her
a
dowdy
little
creature
as
long
as
she
remained
under
miss
minifer
instruction
and
it
was
unremarked
and
almost
unseen
in
the
porter
dark
lodge
of
inn
that
this
little
flower
bloomed
into
beauty
so
this
young
person
hung
upon
mr
pen
arm
and
they
paced
the
gardens
together
empty
as
london
was
there
were
still
some
two
millions
of
people
left
lingering
about
it
and
amongst
them
one
or
two
of
the
acquaintances
of
arthur
pendennis
amongst
them
silent
and
alone
pale
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
a
rueful
nod
of
the
head
to
arthur
as
they
met
passed
henry
foker
esq
young
henry
was
trying
to
ease
his
mind
by
moving
from
place
to
place
and
from
excitement
to
excitement
but
he
thought
about
blanche
as
he
sauntered
in
the
dark
walks
he
thought
about
blanche
as
he
looked
at
the
devices
of
the
lamps
he
consulted
the
about
her
and
was
disappointed
when
that
gipsy
told
him
that
he
was
in
love
with
a
dark
lady
who
would
make
him
happy
and
at
the
concert
though
momus
sang
his
most
stunning
comic
songs
and
asked
his
most
astonishing
riddles
never
did
a
kind
smile
come
to
visit
foker
lips
in
fact
he
never
heard
momus
at
all
pen
and
miss
bolton
were
hard
by
listening
to
the
same
concert
and
the
latter
remarked
and
pen
laughed
at
foker
woebegone
face
fanny
asked
what
it
was
that
made
that
little
man
so
dismal
i
think
he
is
crossed
in
love
pen
said
is
that
enough
to
make
any
man
dismal
fanny
and
he
looked
down
at
her
splendidly
protecting
her
like
egmont
at
clara
in
goethe
play
or
leicester
at
amy
in
scott
novel
crossed
in
love
is
he
poor
gentleman
said
fanny
with
a
sigh
and
her
eyes
turned
round
towards
him
with
no
little
kindness
and
pity
but
harry
did
not
see
the
beautiful
dark
eyes
how
dy
do
pendennis
a
voice
broke
in
here
it
was
that
of
a
young
man
in
a
large
white
coat
with
a
red
neckcloth
over
which
a
dingy
was
turned
so
as
to
exhibit
a
dubious
neck
with
a
large
pin
of
bullion
or
other
metal
and
an
imaginative
waistcoat
with
exceedingly
fanciful
glass
buttons
and
trousers
that
cried
with
a
loud
voice
come
look
at
me
and
see
how
cheap
and
tawdry
i
am
my
master
what
a
dirty
buck
and
a
little
stick
in
one
pocket
of
his
coat
and
a
lady
in
pink
satin
on
the
other
arm
how
dy
do
forget
me
i
dare
say
huxter
how
do
you
do
huxter
the
prince
of
fairoaks
said
in
his
most
princely
manner
i
hope
you
are
very
pretty
bobbish
and
huxter
wagged
his
head
i
say
pendennis
you
been
coming
it
uncommon
strong
since
we
had
the
row
at
wapshot
do
you
remember
great
author
hay
go
about
with
the
swells
saw
your
name
in
the
morning
post
i
suppose
you
too
much
of
a
swell
to
come
and
have
a
bit
of
supper
with
an
old
friend
charterhouse
lane
night
some
devilish
good
fellows
from
bartholomew
and
some
stunning
here
my
and
with
this
huxter
released
his
hand
from
the
pocket
where
his
cane
was
and
pulling
off
the
top
of
his
with
his
teeth
produced
thence
a
visiting
ticket
which
he
handed
to
pen
you
are
exceedingly
kind
i
am
sure
said
pen
but
i
regret
that
i
have
an
engagement
which
will
take
me
out
of
town
and
the
marquis
of
fairoaks
wondering
that
such
a
creature
as
this
could
have
the
audacity
to
give
him
a
card
put
huxter
card
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
with
a
lofty
courtesy
possibly
samuel
huxter
was
not
aware
that
there
was
any
great
social
difference
between
arthur
pendennis
and
himself
huxter
father
was
a
surgeon
and
apothecary
at
clavering
just
as
pendennis
papa
had
been
a
surgeon
and
apothecary
at
bath
but
the
impudence
of
some
men
is
beyond
all
calculation
well
old
fellow
never
mind
said
huxter
who
always
frank
and
familiar
was
from
vinous
excitement
even
more
affable
than
usual
if
ever
you
are
passing
look
up
our
place
i
mostly
at
home
saturdays
and
there
generally
a
cheese
cupboard
ta
there
the
bell
for
the
fireworks
ringing
come
along
and
he
set
off
running
with
the
rest
of
the
crowd
in
the
direction
of
the
fireworks
so
did
pen
presently
when
this
agreeable
youth
was
out
of
sight
begin
to
run
with
his
little
companion
bolton
following
after
them
with
captain
costigan
at
her
side
but
the
captain
was
too
majestic
and
dignified
in
his
movements
to
run
for
friend
or
enemy
and
he
pursued
his
course
with
the
usual
jaunty
swagger
which
distinguished
his
steps
so
that
he
and
his
companion
were
speedily
distanced
by
pen
and
miss
fanny
perhaps
arthur
forgot
or
perhaps
he
did
not
choose
to
remember
that
the
elder
couple
had
no
money
in
their
pockets
as
had
been
proved
by
their
adventure
at
the
entrance
of
the
gardens
howbeit
pen
paid
a
couple
of
shillings
for
himself
and
his
partner
and
with
her
hanging
close
on
his
arm
scaled
the
staircase
which
leads
to
the
firework
gallery
the
captain
and
mamma
might
have
followed
them
if
they
liked
but
arthur
and
fanny
were
too
busy
to
look
back
people
were
pushing
and
squeezing
there
beside
and
behind
them
one
eager
individual
rushed
by
fanny
and
elbowed
her
so
that
she
fell
back
with
a
little
cry
upon
which
of
course
arthur
caught
her
adroitly
in
his
arms
and
just
for
protection
kept
her
so
defended
until
they
mounted
the
stair
and
took
their
places
poor
foker
sate
alone
on
one
of
the
highest
benches
his
face
illuminated
by
the
fireworks
or
in
their
absence
by
the
moon
arthur
saw
him
and
laughed
but
did
not
occupy
himself
about
his
friend
much
he
was
engaged
with
fanny
how
she
wondered
how
happy
she
was
how
she
cried
o
o
o
as
the
rockets
soared
into
the
air
and
showered
down
in
azure
and
emerald
and
vermilion
as
these
wonders
blazed
and
disappeared
before
her
the
little
girl
thrilled
and
trembled
with
delight
at
arthur
side
her
hand
was
under
his
arm
still
he
felt
it
pressing
him
as
she
looked
up
delighted
how
beautiful
they
are
sir
she
cried
do
call
me
sir
fanny
arthur
said
a
quick
blush
rushed
up
into
the
girl
face
what
shall
i
call
you
she
said
in
a
low
voice
sweet
and
tremulous
what
would
you
wish
me
to
say
sir
again
fanny
well
i
forgot
it
is
best
so
my
dear
pendennis
said
very
kindly
and
gently
i
may
call
you
fanny
oh
yes
she
said
and
the
little
hand
pressed
his
arm
once
more
very
eagerly
and
the
girl
clung
to
him
so
that
he
could
feel
her
heart
beating
on
his
shoulder
i
may
call
you
fanny
because
you
are
a
young
girl
and
a
good
girl
fanny
and
i
am
an
old
gentleman
but
you
must
call
me
anything
but
sir
or
pendennis
if
you
like
for
we
live
in
very
different
stations
fanny
and
do
think
i
speak
unkindly
and
and
why
do
you
take
your
hand
away
fanny
are
you
afraid
of
me
do
you
think
i
would
hurt
you
not
for
all
the
world
my
dear
little
girl
and
and
look
how
beautiful
the
moon
and
stars
are
and
how
calmly
they
shine
when
the
rockets
have
gone
out
and
the
noisy
wheels
have
done
hissing
and
blazing
when
i
came
here
i
did
not
think
i
should
have
had
such
a
pretty
little
companion
to
sit
by
my
side
and
see
these
fine
fireworks
you
must
know
i
live
by
myself
and
work
very
hard
i
write
in
books
and
newspapers
fanny
and
i
quite
tired
out
and
was
expected
to
sit
alone
all
night
and
do
cry
my
dear
dear
little
here
pen
broke
out
rapidly
putting
an
end
to
the
calm
oration
which
he
had
begun
to
deliver
for
the
sight
of
a
woman
tears
always
put
his
nerves
in
a
quiver
and
he
began
forthwith
to
coax
her
and
soothe
her
and
to
utter
a
hundred
and
twenty
little
ejaculations
of
pity
and
sympathy
which
need
not
be
repeated
here
because
they
would
be
absurd
in
print
so
would
a
mother
talk
to
a
child
be
absurd
in
print
so
would
a
lover
to
his
bride
that
sweet
artless
poetry
bears
no
translation
and
is
too
subtle
for
grammarians
clumsy
definitions
you
have
but
the
same
four
letters
to
describe
the
salute
which
you
perform
on
your
grandmother
forehead
and
that
which
you
bestow
on
the
sacred
cheek
of
your
mistress
but
the
same
four
letters
and
not
one
of
them
a
labial
do
we
mean
to
hint
that
arthur
pendennis
made
any
use
of
the
monosyllable
in
question
not
so
in
the
first
place
it
was
dark
the
fireworks
were
over
and
nobody
could
see
him
secondly
he
was
not
a
man
to
have
this
kind
of
secret
and
tell
it
thirdly
and
lastly
let
the
honest
fellow
who
has
kissed
a
pretty
girl
say
what
would
have
been
his
own
conduct
in
such
a
delicate
juncture
well
the
truth
is
that
however
you
may
suspect
him
and
whatever
you
would
have
done
under
the
circumstances
or
mr
pen
would
have
liked
to
do
he
behaved
honestly
and
like
a
man
i
will
not
play
with
this
little
girl
heart
he
said
within
himself
and
forget
my
own
or
her
honour
she
seems
to
have
a
great
deal
of
dangerous
and
rather
contagious
sensibility
and
i
am
very
glad
the
fireworks
are
over
and
that
i
can
take
her
back
to
her
mother
come
along
fanny
mind
the
steps
and
lean
on
me
do
stumble
you
heedless
little
thing
this
is
the
way
and
there
is
your
mamma
at
the
and
there
indeed
bolton
was
unquiet
in
spirit
and
grasping
her
umbrella
she
seized
fanny
with
maternal
fierceness
and
eagerness
and
uttered
some
rapid
abuse
to
the
girl
in
an
undertone
the
expression
in
captain
costigan
eye
standing
behind
the
matron
and
winking
at
pendennis
from
under
his
hat
was
i
am
bound
to
say
indefinably
humorous
it
was
so
much
so
that
pen
could
not
refrain
from
bursting
into
a
laugh
you
should
have
taken
my
arm
bolton
he
said
offering
it
i
am
very
glad
to
bring
miss
fanny
back
quite
safe
to
you
we
thought
you
would
have
followed
us
up
into
the
gallery

angry
with

unless

will

with
her
society
and
we
will
all
sup
quietly
and
go
back
in
a
cab
the
cab
the
lobster
salad
the
frank
and
look
of
pendennis
as
he
smilingly
invited
the
worthy
matron
subdued
her
suspicions
and
her
anger
since
he
would
be
so
obliging
she
thought
she
could
take
a
little
bit
of
lobster
and
so
they
all
marched
away
to
a
box
and
costigan
called
for
a
waither
with
such
a
loud
and
belligerent
voice
as
caused
one
of
those
officials
instantly
to
run
to
him
the
carte
was
examined
on
the
wall
and
fanny
was
asked
to
choose
her
favourite
dish
upon
which
the
young
creature
said
she
was
fond
of
lobster
too
but
also
owned
to
a
partiality
for
raspberry
tart
this
delicacy
was
provided
by
pen
and
a
bottle
of
the
most
frisky
champagne
was
moreover
ordered
for
the
delight
of
the
ladies
little
fanny
drank
this
what
other
sweet
intoxication
had
she
not
drunk
in
the
course
of
the
night
when
the
supper
which
was
very
brisk
and
gay
was
over
and
captain
costigan
and
bolton
had
partaken
of
some
of
the
that
is
so
fragrant
at
vauxhall
the
bill
was
called
and
discharged
by
pen
with
great
generosity
loike
a
foin
young
english
gentleman
of
th
olden
toime
be
jove
costigan
enthusiastically
remarked
and
as
when
they
went
out
of
the
box
he
stepped
forward
and
gave
bolton
his
arm
fanny
fell
to
pen
lot
and
the
young
people
walked
away
in
high
together
in
the
wake
of
their
seniors
the
champagne
and
the
though
taken
in
moderation
by
all
persons
except
perhaps
poor
cos
who
lurched
ever
so
little
in
his
gait
had
set
them
in
high
spirits
and
so
that
fanny
began
to
skip
and
move
her
brisk
little
feet
in
time
to
the
band
which
was
playing
waltzes
and
galops
for
the
dancers
as
they
came
up
to
the
dancing
the
music
and
fanny
feet
seemed
to
go
quicker
together
she
seemed
to
spring
as
if
naturally
from
the
ground
and
as
if
she
required
repression
to
keep
her
there
should
you
like
a
turn
said
the
prince
of
fairoaks
what
fun
it
would
be
bolton
do
let
me
take
her
once
upon
which
costigan
said
off
wid
you
and
bolton
not
refusing
indeed
she
was
an
old
and
would
have
liked
at
the
trumpet
sound
to
have
entered
the
arena
herself
fanny
shawl
was
off
her
back
in
a
minute
and
she
and
arthur
were
whirling
round
in
a
waltz
in
the
midst
of
a
great
deal
of
queer
but
exceedingly
joyful
company
pen
had
no
mishap
this
time
with
little
fanny
as
he
had
with
miss
blanche
in
old
days
at
least
there
was
no
mishap
of
his
making
the
pair
danced
away
with
great
agility
and
contentment
first
a
waltz
then
a
galop
then
a
waltz
again
until
in
the
second
waltz
they
were
bumped
by
another
couple
who
had
joined
the
terpsichorean
choir
this
was
huxter
and
his
pink
satin
young
friend
of
whom
we
have
already
had
a
glimpse
huxter
very
probably
had
been
also
partaking
of
supper
for
he
was
even
more
excited
now
than
at
the
time
when
he
had
previously
claimed
pen
acquaintance
and
having
run
against
arthur
and
his
partner
and
nearly
knocked
them
down
this
amiable
gentleman
of
course
began
to
abuse
the
people
whom
he
had
injured
and
broke
out
into
a
volley
of
slang
against
the
unoffending
couple
now
then
stoopid
do
keep
the
ground
if
you
ca
dance
old
slow
coach
the
young
surgeon
roared
out
using
at
the
same
time
other
expressions
far
more
emphatic
and
was
joined
in
his
abuse
by
the
shrill
language
and
laughter
of
his
partner
to
the
interruption
of
the
ball
the
terror
of
poor
little
fanny
and
the
immense
indignation
of
pen
arthur
was
furious
and
not
so
angry
at
the
quarrel
as
at
the
shame
attending
it
a
battle
with
a
fellow
like
that
a
row
in
a
public
garden
and
with
a
porter
daughter
on
his
arm
what
a
position
for
arthur
pendennis
he
drew
poor
little
fanny
hastily
away
from
the
dancers
to
her
mother
and
wished
that
lady
and
costigan
and
poor
fanny
underground
rather
than
there
in
his
companionship
and
under
his
protection
when
huxter
commenced
his
attack
that
young
gentleman
had
not
seen
who
was
his
opponent
and
directly
he
was
aware
that
it
was
arthur
whom
he
had
insulted
he
began
to
make
apologies
hold
your
stoopid
tongue
mary
he
said
to
his
partner
it
an
old
friend
and
crony
at
home
i
beg
pardon
pendennis
was
aware
it
was
you
old
huxter
had
been
one
of
the
boys
of
the
clavering
school
who
had
been
present
at
a
combat
which
has
been
mentioned
in
the
early
part
of
this
story
when
young
pen
knocked
down
the
biggest
champion
of
the
academy
and
huxter
knew
that
it
was
dangerous
to
quarrel
with
arthur
his
apologies
were
as
odious
to
the
other
as
his
abuse
had
been
pen
stopped
his
tipsy
remonstrance
by
telling
him
to
hold
his
tongue
and
desiring
him
not
to
use
his
pendennis
name
in
that
place
or
any
other
and
he
walked
out
of
the
gardens
with
a
titter
behind
him
from
the
crowd
every
one
of
whom
he
would
have
liked
to
massacre
for
having
been
witness
to
the
degrading
broil
he
walked
out
of
the
gardens
quite
forgetting
poor
little
fanny
who
came
trembling
behind
him
with
her
mother
and
the
stately
costigan
he
was
brought
back
to
himself
by
a
word
from
the
captain
who
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
just
as
they
were
passing
the
inner
gate
there
no
except
ye
pay
again
the
captain
said
had
i
better
go
back
and
take
the
fellow
your
message
pen
burst
out
laughing
take
him
a
message
do
you
think
i
would
fight
with
such
a
fellow
as
that
he
asked
no
no
do
do
cried
out
little
fanny
how
can
you
be
so
wicked
captain
costigan
the
captain
muttered
something
about
honour
and
winked
knowingly
at
pen
but
arthur
said
gallantly
no
fanny
do
be
frightened
it
was
my
fault
to
have
danced
in
such
a
place
i
beg
your
padon
to
have
asked
you
to
dance
and
he
gave
her
his
arm
once
more
and
called
a
cab
and
put
his
three
friends
into
it
he
was
about
to
pay
the
driver
and
to
take
another
carriage
for
himself
when
little
fanny
still
alarmed
put
her
little
hand
out
and
caught
him
by
the
coat
and
implored
him
and
besought
him
to
come
in
will
nothing
satisfy
you
said
pen
in
great
that
i
am
not
going
back
to
fight
him
well
i
will
come
home
with
you
drive
to
shepherd
inn
the
cab
drove
to
its
destination
arthur
was
immensely
pleased
by
the
girl
solicitude
about
him
her
tender
terrors
quite
made
him
forget
his
previous
annoyance
pen
put
the
ladies
into
their
lodge
having
shaken
hands
kindly
with
both
of
them
and
the
captain
again
whispered
to
him
that
he
would
see
um
in
the
morning
if
he
was
inclined
and
take
his
message
to
that
but
the
captain
was
in
his
usual
condition
when
he
made
the
proposal
and
pen
was
perfectly
sure
that
neither
he
nor
huxter
when
they
awoke
would
remember
anything
about
the
dispute
chapter
xlviii
a
visit
of

costigan
never
roused
pen
from
his
slumbers
there
was
no
hostile
message
from
huxter
to
disturb
him
and
when
pen
woke
it
was
with
a
brisker
and
more
lively
feeling
than
ordinarily
attends
that
moment
in
the
day
of
the
tired
and
blase
london
man
a
city
man
wakes
up
to
care
and
consols
and
the

take

as

rouses
himself
with
the

morning
to

of

upon

the
inevitable

rather
his
disposition
was
of
that
sort
that
his
daily
occupations
did
not
much
interest
him
for
the

as
prosaic
as
any

hack

without
his
whip
or
his

so
indeed
arthur
performed
his
work
at
the
pall
mall
gazette
and
since
his
success
as
a
novelist
with
an
increased
salary
but
without
the
least
enthusiasm
doing
his
best
or
pretty
nearly
and
sometimes
writing
ill
and
sometimes
well
he
was
a
literary
hack
naturally
fast
in
pace
and
brilliant
in
action
neither
did
society
or
that
portion
which
he
saw
excite
or
amuse
him
over
much
in
spite
of
his
brag
and
boast
to
the
contrary
he
was
too
young
as
yet
for
women
society
which
probably
can
only
be
had
in
perfection
when
a
man
has
ceased
to
think
about
his
own
person
and
has
given
up
all
designs
of
being
a
conqueror
of
ladies
he
was
too
young
to
be
admitted
as
an
equal
amongst
men
who
had
made
their
mark
in
the
world
and
of
whose
conversation
he
could
scarcely
as
yet
expect
to
be
more
than
a
listener
and
he
was
too
old
for
the
men
of
pleasure
of
his
own
age
too
much
a
man

this
lot
of
solitude
to
many
a
man
and
many
like
it
from
taste
as
many
without
difficulty
bear
it
pendennis
in
reality
suffered
it
very
equanimously
but
in
words
and
according
to
his
wont
grumbled
over
it
not
a
little
what
a
nice
little
artless
creature
that
was
mr
pen
thought
at
the
very
instant
of
waking
after
the
vauxhall
affair
what
a
pretty
natural
manner
she
has
how
much
pleasanter
than
the
minauderies
of
the
young
ladies
in
the
ballrooms
and
here
he
recalled
to
himself
some
instances
of
what
he
could
not
help
seeing
was
the
artful
simplicity
of
miss
blanche
and
some
of
the
stupid
graces
of
other
young
ladies
in
the
polite
world
who
could
have
thought
that
such
a
pretty
rose
could
grow
in
a
porter
lodge
or
bloom
in
that
dismal
old
of
a
shepherd
inn
so
she
learns
to
sing
from
old
bows
if
her
singing
voice
is
as
sweet
as
her
speaking
voice
it
must
be
pretty
i
like
those
low
voilees
voices
would
you
like
me
to
call
you
indeed
poor
little
fanny
it
went
to
my
heart
to
adopt
the
grand
air
with
her
and
tell
her
to
call
me
but
we
have
no
nonsense
of
that
sort
no
faust
and
margaret
business
for
me
that
old
bows
so
he
teaches
her
to
sing
does
he
he
a
dear
old
fellow
old
bows
a
gentleman
in
those
old
clothes
a
philosopher
and
with
a
kind
heart
too
how
good
he
was
to
me
in
the
fotheringay
business
he
too
has
had
his
griefs
and
his
sorrows
i
must
cultivate
old
bows
a
man
ought
to
see
people
of
all
sorts
i
am
getting
tired
of
genteel
society
besides
there
nobody
in
town
yes
i
go
and
see
bows
and
costigan
too
what
a
rich
character
begad
i
study
him
and
put
him
into
a
in
this
way
our
young
anthropologist
talked
with
himself
and
as
saturday
was
the
holiday
of
the
week
the
pall
mall
gazette
making
its
appearance
upon
that
day
and
the
contributors
to
that
journal
having
no
further
calls
upon
their
brains
or
pendennis
determined
he
would
take
advantage
of
his
leisure
and
pay
a
visit
to
shepherd
inn
of
course
to
see
old
bows
the
truth
is
that
if
arthur
had
been
the
most
determined
roue
and
artful
lovelace
who
ever
set
about
deceiving
a
young
girl
he
could
hardly
have
adopted
better
means
for
fascinating
and
overcoming
poor
little
fanny
bolton
than
those
which
he
had
employed
on
the
previous
night
his
dandified
protecting
air
his
conceit
generosity
and
the
very
sense
of
good
and
honesty
which
had
enabled
him
to
check
the
tremulous
advances
of
the
young
creature
and
not
to
take
advantage
of
that
little
fluttering
sensibility
his
faults
and
his
virtues
at
once
contributed
to
make
her
admire
him
and
if
we
could
peep
into
fanny
bed
which
she
shared
in
a
cupboard
along
with
those
two
little
sisters
to
whom
we
have
seen
costigan
administering
gingerbread
and
apples
we
should
find
the
poor
little
maid
tossing
upon
her
mattress
to
the
great
disturbance
of
its
other
two
occupants
and
thinking
over
all
the
delights
and
events
of
that
delightful
eventful
night
and
all
the
words
looks
and
actions
of
arthur
its
splendid
hero
many
novels
had
fanny
read
in
secret
and
at
home
in
three
volumes
and
in
numbers
periodical
literature
had
not
reached
the
height
which
it
has
attained
subsequently
and
the
girls
of
generation
were
not
enabled
to
purchase
sixteen
pages
of
excitement
for
a
penny
rich
with
histories
of
crime
murder
oppressed
virtue
and
the
heartless
seductions
of
the
aristocracy
but
she
had
had
the
benefit
of
the
circulating
library
which
in
conjunction
with
her
school
and
a
small
and
millinery
business
miss
minifer
kept
and
arthur
appeared
to
her
at
once
as
the
type
and
realisation
of
all
the
heroes
of
all
those
darling
greasy
volumes
which
the
young
girl
had
devoured
mr
pen
we
have
seen
was
rather
a
dandy
about
shirts
and
haberdashery
in
general
fanny
had
looked
with
delight
at
the
fineness
of
his
linen
at
the
brilliancy
of
his
at
his
elegant
cambric
and
white
gloves
and
at
the
jetty
brightness
of
his
charming
boots
the
prince
had
appeared
and
subjugated
the
poor
little
handmaid
his
image
traversed
constantly
her
restless
slumbers
the
tone
of
his
voice
the
blue
light
of
his
eyes
the
generous
look
half
love
half
pity
the
manly
protecting
smile
the
frank
winning
laughter
all
these
were
repeated
in
the
girl
fond
memory
she
felt
still
his
arm
encircling
her
and
saw
him
smiling
so
grand
as
he
filled
up
that
delicious
glass
of
champagne
and
then
she
thought
of
the
girls
her
friends
who
used
to
sneer
at
her
of
emma
baker
who
was
so
proud
forsooth
because
she
was
engaged
to
a
cheesemonger
in
a
white
apron
near
clare
market
and
of
betsy
rodgers
who
make
such
a
about
her
young
man
an
attorney
clerk
indeed
that
went
about
with
a
bag
so
that
at
about
two
in
the
afternoon
the
bolton
family
having
concluded
their
dinner
and
who
besides
his
place
of
porter
of
the
inn
was
in
the
employ
of
tressler
the
eminent
undertakers
of
the
strand
being
absent
in
the
country
with
the
countess
of
estrich
hearse
when
a
gentleman
in
a
white
hat
and
white
trousers
made
his
appearance
under
the
inn
archway
and
stopped
at
the
wicket
fanny
was
not
in
the
least
surprised
only
delightful
only
happy
and
blushing
beyond
all
measure
she
knew
it
could
be
no
other
than
he
she
knew
he
come
there
he
was
there
was
his
royal
highness
beaming
upon
her
from
the
gate
she
called
to
her
mother
who
was
busy
in
the
upper
apartment
mamma
mamma
and
ran
to
the
wicket
at
once
and
opened
it
pushing
aside
the
other
children
how
she
blushed
as
she
gave
her
hand
to
him
how
affably
he
took
off
his
white
hat
as
he
came
in
the
children
staring
up
at
him
he
asked
bolton
if
she
had
slept
well
after
the
fatigues
of
the
night
and
hoped
she
had
no
headache
and
he
said
that
as
he
was
going
that
way
he
could
not
pass
the
door
without
asking
news
of
his
little
partner
bolton
was
perhaps
rather
shy
and
suspicious
about
these
advances
but
mr
pen
was
inexhaustible
he
could
not
see
that
he
was
unwelcome
he
looked
about
the
premises
for
a
seat
and
none
being
disengaged
for
a
was
on
one
a
workbox
on
the
other
and
so
forth
he
took
one
of
the
children
chairs
and
perched
himself
upon
that
uncomfortable
eminence
at
this
the
children
began
laughing
the
child
fanny
louder
than
all
at
least
she
was
more
amused
than
any
of
them
and
amazed
at
his
royal
highness
condescension
he
to
sit
down
in
that
chair
that
little
child
chair
many
and
many
a
time
after
she
regarded
it
have
we
almost
all
such
furniture
in
our
rooms
that
our
fancy
peoples
with
dear
figures
that
our
memory
fills
with
sweet
smiling
faces
which
may
never
look
on
us
more
so
pen
sate
down
and
talked
away
with
great
volubility
to
bolton
he
asked
about
the
undertaking
business
and
how
many
mutes
went
down
with
lady
estrich
remains
and
about
the
inn
and
who
lived
there
he
seemed
very
much
interested
about
campion
cab
and
horse
and
had
met
that
gentleman
in
society
he
thought
he
should
like
shares
in
the
polwheedle
and
tredyddlum
did
bolton
do
for
those
chambers
were
there
any
chambers
to
let
in
the
inn
it
was
better
than
the
temple
he
should
like
to
come
to
live
in
shepherd
inn
as
for
captain
strong
and
colonel
altamont
was
his
name
he
was
deeply
interested
in
them
too
the
captain
was
an
old
friend
at
home
he
had
dined
with
him
at
chambers
here
before
the
colonel
came
to
live
with
him
what
sort
of
man
was
the
colonel
was
he
a
stout
man
with
a
large
quantity
of
jewellery
and
a
wig
and
large
black
whiskers
very
black
here
pen
was
immensely
waggish
and
caused
hysteric
giggles
of
delight
from
the
ladies
very
black
indeed
in
fact
blue
black
that
is
to
say
a
rich
greenish
purple
that
was
the
man
he
had
met
him
too
at
sir
fr
in
society
oh
we
know
said
the
ladies
sir
f
is
sir
clavering
often
here
two
or
three
times
a
week
with
the
captain
my
little
boy
has
been
out
for
for
him
o
lor
i
beg
pardon
i
have
mentioned
no
secrets
bolton
blurted
out
being
talked
perfectly
into
by
this
time
but
we
know
you
to
be
a
gentleman
pendennis
for
i
sure
you
have
shown
that
you
can
beayve
as
such
has
pendennis
fanny
fanny
loved
her
mother
for
that
speech
she
cast
up
her
dark
eyes
to
the
low
ceiling
and
said
oh
that
he
has
i
sure
ma
with
a
voice
full
of
feeling
pen
was
rather
curious
about
the
and
concerning
the
transactions
in
strong
chambers
and
he
asked
when
altamont
came
and
joined
the
chevalier
whether
he
too
was
out
for
who
he
was
whether
he
saw
many
people
and
so
forth
these
questions
put
with
considerable
adroitness
by
pen
who
was
interested
about
sir
francis
clavering
doings
from
private
motives
of
his
own
were
artlessly
answered
by
bolton
and
to
the
utmost
of
her
knowledge
and
ability
which
in
truth
were
not
very
great
these
questions
answered
and
pen
being
at
a
loss
for
more
luckily
recollected
his
privilege
as
a
member
of
the
press
and
asked
the
ladies
whether
they
would
like
any
orders
for
the
play
the
play
was
their
delight
as
it
is
almost
always
the
delight
of
every
theatrical
person
when
bolton
was
away
professionally
it
appeared
that
of
late
the
porter
of
shepherd
inn
had
taken
a
serious
turn
drank
a
good
deal
and
otherwise
made
himself
unpleasant
to
the
ladies
of
his
family
they
would
like
of
all
things
to
slip
out
and
go
to
the
theatre
little
barney
their
son
keeping
the
lodge
and
pendennis
most
generous
and
most
genteel
compliment
of
orders
was
received
with
boundless
gratitude
by
both
mother
and
daughter
fanny
clapped
her
hands
with
pleasure
her
faced
beamed
with
it
she
looked
and
nodded
and
laughed
at
her
mamma
who
nodded
and
laughed
in
her
turn
bolton
was
not
superannuated
for
pleasure
yet
or
by
any
means
too
old
for
admiration
she
thought
and
very
likely
pendennis
in
his
conversation
with
her
had
insinuated
some
compliments
or
shaped
his
talk
so
as
to
please
her
at
first
against
pen
and
suspicious
of
him
she
was
his
partisan
now
and
almost
as
enthusiastic
about
him
as
her
daughter
when
two
women
get
together
to
like
a
man
they
help
each
other
on
each
pushes
the
other
forward
and
the
second
out
of
sheer
sympathy
becomes
as
eager
as
the
principal
at
least
so
it
is
said
by
philosophers
who
have
examined
this
science
so
the
offer
of
the
and
other
pleasantries
put
all
parties
into
perfect
except
for
one
brief
moment
when
one
of
the
younger
children
hearing
the
name
of
pronounced
came
forward
and
stated
that
she
should
like
very
much
to
go
too
on
which
fanny
said
do
bother
rather
sharply
and
mamma
said
do
now
and
play
in
the
court
so
that
the
two
little
ones
namely
and
ameliar
ann
went
away
in
their
little
innocent
pinafores
and
disported
in
the
courtyard
on
the
smooth
gravel
round
about
the
statue
of
shepherd
the
great
and
here
as
they
were
playing
they
very
possibly
communicated
with
an
old
friend
of
theirs
and
dweller
in
the
inn
for
while
pen
was
making
himself
agreeable
to
the
ladies
at
the
lodge
who
were
laughing
delighted
at
his
sallies
an
old
gentleman
passed
under
the
archway
from
the
and
came
and
looked
in
at
the
door
of
the
lodge
he
made
a
very
blank
and
rueful
face
when
he
saw
arthur
seated
upon
a
table
like
macheath
in
the
play
in
easy
discourse
with
bolton
and
her
daughter
what
bows
how
do
bows
cried
out
pen
in
a
cheery
loud
voice
i
was
coming
to
see
you
and
was
asking
your
address
of
these
you
were
coming
to
see
me
were
you
sir
bows
said
and
came
in
with
a
sad
face
and
shook
hands
with
arthur
plague
on
that
old
man
somebody
thought
in
the
room
and
so
perhaps
some
one
else
besides
her
chapter
xlix
in
shepherd
inn
our
friend
pen
said
how
d
do
bows
in
a
loud
cheery
voice
on
perceiving
that
gentleman
and
saluted
him
in
a
dashing
manner
yet
you
could
have
seen
a
blush
upon
arthur
face
answered
by
fanny
whose
cheek
straightway
threw
out
a
similar
fluttering
red
signal
and
after
bows
and
arthur
had
shaken
hands
and
the
former
had
ironically
accepted
the
other
assertion
that
he
was
about
to
pay
chambers
a
visit
there
was
a
gloomy
and
rather
guilty
silence
in
the
company
which
pen
presently
tried
to
dispel
by
making
a
great
rattling
noise
the
silence
of
course
departed
at
arthur
noise
but
the
gloom
remained
and
deepened
as
the
darkness
does
in
a
vault
if
you
light
up
a
single
taper
in
it
pendennis
tried
to
describe
in
a
jocular
manner
the
transactions
of
the
previous
night
and
attempted
to
give
an
imitation
of
costigan
vainly
expostulating
with
the
at
vauxhall
it
was
not
a
good
imitation
what
stranger
can
imitate
that
perfection
nobody
laughed
bolton
did
not
in
the
least
understand
what
part
pendennis
was
performing
and
whether
it
was
the
or
the
captain
he
was
taking
off
fanny
wore
an
alarmed
face
and
tried
a
timid
giggle
old
bows
looked
as
glum
as
when
he
fiddled
in
the
orchestra
or
played
a
difficult
piece
upon
the
old
piano
at
the
back
kitchen
pen
felt
that
his
story
was
a
failure
his
voice
sank
and
dwindled
away
dismally
at
the
end
of
it
flickered
and
went
out
and
it
was
all
dark
again
you
could
hear
the
who
lolls
about
shepherd
inn
as
he
passed
on
the
flags
under
the
archway
the
clink
of
his
was
noted
by
everybody
you
were
coming
to
see
me
sir
bows
said
wo
you
have
the
kindness
to
walk
up
to
my
chambers
with
me
you
do
them
a
great
honour
i
am
sure
they
are
rather
high
up
but
oh
i
live
in
a
garret
myself
and
shepherd
inn
is
twice
as
cheerful
as
lamb
court
pendennis
broke
in
i
knew
that
you
had
apartments
bows
said
and
was
going
to
say
you
will
please
not
take
my
remark
as
discourteous
that
the
air
up
three
pair
of
stairs
is
wholesomer
for
gentlemen
than
the
air
of
a
porter
sir
said
pen
whose
candle
flamed
up
again
in
his
wrath
and
who
was
disposed
to
be
as
quarrelsome
as
men
are
when
they
are
in
the
wrong
will
you
permit
me
to
choose
my
society
without
you
were
so
polite
as
to
say
that
you
were
about
to
honour
my
umble
domicile
with
a
visit
bows
said
with
his
sad
voice
shall
i
show
you
the
way
pendennis
and
i
are
old
friends
bolton
very
old
acquaintances
and
at
the
earliest
dawn
of
his
life
we
crossed
each
the
old
man
pointed
towards
the
door
with
a
trembling
finger
and
a
hat
in
the
other
hand
and
in
an
attitude
slightly
theatrical
so
were
his
words
when
he
spoke
somewhat
artificial
and
chosen
from
the
vocabulary
which
he
had
heard
all
his
life
from
the
painted
lips
of
the
orators
before
the
but
he
was
not
acting
or
masquerading
as
pen
knew
very
well
though
he
was
disposed
to
the
old
melodramatic
airs
come
along
sir
he
said
as
you
are
so
very
pressing
bolton
i
wish
you
a
good
day
miss
fanny
i
shall
always
think
of
our
night
at
vauxhall
with
pleasure
and
be
sure
i
will
remember
the
theatre
and
he
took
her
hand
pressed
it
was
pressed
by
it
and
was
gone
what
a
nice
young
man
to
be
sure
cried
bolton
think
so
ma
said
fanny
i
was
who
he
was
like
when
i
was
at
the
wells
with
serle
bolton
continued
looking
through
the
after
pen
as
he
went
up
the
court
with
bows
there
was
a
young
gentleman
from
the
city
that
used
to
come
in
a
tilbry
in
a
white
at
the
very
image
of
him
only
his
whiskers
was
black
and
is
law
ma
they
are
a
most
beautiful
hawburn
fanny
said
he
used
to
come
for
emly
budd
who
danced
columbine
in
ornpipe
or
the
battle
of
navarino
when
miss
de
la
bosky
was
took
ill
a
pretty
dancer
and
a
fine
stage
figure
of
a
woman
and
he
was
a
great
in
the
city
with
a
country
ouse
at
omerton
and
he
used
to
drive
her
in
the
tilbry
down
goswell
street
road
and
one
day
they
drove
and
was
married
at
bartholomew
church
smithfield
where
they
had
their
bands
read
quite
private
and
she
now
keeps
her
carriage
and
i
sor
her
name
in
the
paper
as
patroness
of
the
ball
for
the
washywomen
asylum
and
look
at
lady
mirabel
capting
costigan
daughter
she
was
profeshnl
as
all
very
well
thus
and
more
to
this
purpose
bolton
spoke
now
peeping
through
the
now
cleaning
the
mugs
and
plates
and
consigning
them
to
their
place
in
the
corner
cupboard
and
finishing
her
speech
as
she
and
fanny
shook
out
and
folded
up
the
between
them
and
restored
it
to
its
drawer
in
the
table
although
costigan
had
once
before
been
made
pretty
accurately
to
understand
what
pen
pecuniary
means
and
expectations
were
i
suppose
cos
had
forgotten
the
information
acquired
at
chatteris
years
ago
or
had
been
induced
by
his
natural
enthusiasm
to
exaggerate
his
income
he
had
described
fairoaks
park
in
the
most
glowing
terms
to
bolton
on
the
preceding
evening
as
he
was
walking
about
with
her
during
pen
little
escapade
with
fanny
had
dilated
upon
the
enormous
wealth
of
pen
famous
uncle
the
major
and
shown
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
arthur
funded
and
landed
property
very
likely
bolton
in
her
wisdom
had
speculated
upon
these
matters
during
the
night
and
had
had
visions
of
fanny
driving
in
her
carriage
like
bolton
old
comrade
the
dancer
of
sadler
wells
in
the
last
operation
of
folding
these
two
foolish
women
of
necessity
came
close
together
and
as
fanny
took
the
cloth
and
gave
it
the
last
fold
her
mother
put
her
finger
under
the
young
girl
chin
and
kissed
her
again
the
red
signal
flew
out
and
fluttered
on
cheek
what
did
it
mean
it
was
not
alarm
this
time
it
was
pleasure
which
caused
the
poor
little
fanny
to
blush
so
poor
little
fanny
what
is
love
sin
that
it
is
so
pleasant
at
the
beginning
and
so
bitter
at
the
end
after
the
embrace
bolton
thought
proper
to
say
that
she
was
out
upon
business
and
that
fanny
must
keep
the
lodge
which
fanny
after
a
very
faint
objection
indeed
consented
to
do
so
bolton
took
her
bonnet
and
and
departed
and
the
instant
she
was
gone
fanny
went
and
sae
by
the
window
which
commanded
bows
door
and
never
once
took
her
eyes
away
from
that
quarter
of
shepherd
inn
and
were
buzzing
in
one
corner
of
the
place
and
making
believe
to
read
out
of
a
which
one
of
them
held
it
was
a
grave
and
dreadful
tract
of
collection
fanny
did
not
hear
her
sisters
prattling
over
it
she
noticed
nothing
but
bows
door
at
last
she
gave
a
little
shake
and
her
eyes
lighted
up
he
had
come
out
he
would
pass
the
door
again
but
her
poor
little
countenance
fell
in
an
instant
more
pendennis
indeed
came
out
but
bows
followed
after
him
they
passed
under
the
archway
together
he
only
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
as
he
looked
in
he
did
not
stop
to
speak
in
three
or
four
minutes
fanny
did
not
know
how
long
but
she
looked
furiously
at
him
when
he
came
into
the
lodge
bows
returned
alone
and
entered
into
the
porter
room
where
your
ma
dear
he
said
to
fanny
i
do
know
fanny
said
with
an
angry
toss
i
do
follow
steps
wherever
she
goes
i
suppose
am
i
my
mother
keeper
bows
said
with
his
usual
melancholy
bitterness
come
here
and
i
brought
a
cake
for
the
one
who
can
read
her
letters
best
and
a
cake
for
the
other
who
can
read
them
the
next
when
the
young
ladies
had
undergone
the
examination
through
which
bows
put
them
they
were
rewarded
with
their
gingerbread
medals
and
went
off
to
discuss
them
in
the
court
meanwhile
fanny
took
out
some
work
and
pretended
to
busy
herself
with
it
her
mind
being
in
great
excitement
and
anger
as
she
plied
her
needle
bows
sate
so
that
he
could
command
the
entrance
from
the
lodge
to
the
street
but
the
person
whom
perhaps
he
expected
to
see
never
made
his
appearance
again
and
bolton
came
in
from
market
and
found
bows
in
place
of
the
person
whom
she
had
expected
to
see
the
reader
perhaps
can
guess
what
was
his
name
the
interview
between
bows
and
his
guest
when
those
two
mounted
to
the
apartment
occupied
by
the
former
in
common
with
the
descendant
of
the
milesian
kings
was
not
particularly
satisfactory
to
either
party
pen
was
sulky
if
bows
had
anything
on
his
mind
he
did
not
care
to
deliver
himself
of
his
thoughts
in
the
presence
of
captain
costigan
who
remained
in
the
apartment
during
the
whole
of
pen
visit
having
quitted
his
bedchamber
indeed
but
a
very
few
minutes
before
the
arrival
of
that
gentleman
we
have
witnessed
the
deshabille
of
major
pendennis
will
any
man
wish
to
be
to
our
other
hero
costigan
it
would
seem
that
the
captain
before
issuing
from
his
bedroom
scented
himself
with
a
rich
odour
of
that
delicious
perfume
breathed
from
out
him
as
he
held
out
the
grasp
of
cordiality
to
his
visitor
the
hand
which
performed
that
grasp
shook
wofully
it
was
a
wonder
how
it
could
hold
the
razor
with
which
the
poor
gentleman
daily
operated
on
his
chin
bows
room
was
as
neat
on
the
other
hand
as
his
comrade
was
disorderly
his
humble
wardrobe
hung
behind
a
curtain
his
books
and
manuscript
music
were
trimly
arranged
upon
shelves
a
lithographed
portrait
of
miss
fotheringay
as
haller
with
the
sprawling
signature
at
the
corner
hung
faithfully
over
the
old
gentleman
bed
lady
mirabel
wrote
much
better
than
miss
fotheringay
had
been
able
to
do
her
ladyship
had
laboured
assiduously
to
acquire
the
art
of
penmanship
since
her
marriage
and
in
a
common
note
of
invitation
or
acceptance
acquitted
herself
very
genteelly
bows
loved
the
old
handwriting
best
though
the
fair
artist
earlier
manner
he
had
but
one
specimen
of
the
new
style
a
note
in
reply
to
a
song
composed
and
dedicated
to
lady
mirabel
by
her
most
humble
servant
robert
bows
and
which
document
was
treasured
in
his
desk
amongst
his
other
state
papers
he
was
teaching
fanny
bolton
now
to
sing
and
to
write
as
he
had
taught
emily
in
former
days
it
was
the
nature
of
the
man
to
attach
himself
to
something
when
emily
was
torn
from
him
he
took
a
substitute
as
a
man
looks
out
for
a
crutch
when
he
loses
a
leg
or
lashes
himself
to
a
raft
when
he
has
suffered
shipwreck
latude
had
given
his
heart
to
a
woman
no
doubt
before
he
grew
to
be
so
fond
of
a
mouse
in
the
bastille
there
are
people
who
in
their
youth
have
felt
and
inspired
an
heroic
passion
and
end
by
being
happy
in
the
caresses
or
agitated
by
the
illness
of
a
poodle
but
it
was
hard
upon
bows
and
grating
to
his
feelings
as
a
man
and
a
sentimentalist
that
he
should
find
pen
again
upon
his
track
and
in
pursuit
of
this
little
fanny
meanwhile
costigan
had
not
the
least
idea
but
that
his
company
was
perfectly
welcome
to
pendennis
and
bows
and
that
the
visit
of
the
former
was
intended
for
himself
he
expressed
himself
greatly
pleased
with
that
mark
of
poloightness
and
promised
in
his
own
mind
that
he
would
repay
that
obligation
at
least
which
was
not
the
only
debt
which
the
captain
owed
in
life
by
several
visits
to
his
young
friend
he
entertained
him
affably
with
news
of
the
day
or
rather
of
ten
days
previous
for
pen
in
his
quality
of
journalist
remembered
to
have
seen
some
of
the
captain
opinions
in
the
sporting
and
theatrical
newspaper
which
was
costigan
oracle
he
stated
that
sir
charles
and
lady
mirabel
were
gone
to
and
were
most
pressing
in
their
invitations
that
he
should
join
them
there
pen
replied
with
great
gravity
that
he
had
heard
that
baden
was
very
pleasant
and
the
grand
duke
exceedingly
hospitable
to
english
costigan
answered
that
the
laws
of
hospitalitee
bekeam
a
grand
juke
that
he
sariously
would
think
about
visiting
him
and
made
some
remarks
upon
the
splendid
festivities
at
dublin
castle
when
his
excellency
the
earl
of
portansherry
held
the
viceraygal
coort
there
and
of
which
he
costigan
had
been
a
humble
but
pleased
spectator
and
pen
as
he
heard
these
legends
recollected
the
time
when
he
had
given
a
sort
of
credence
to
them
and
had
a
certain
respect
for
the
captain
emily
and
first
love
and
the
little
room
at
chatteris
and
the
kind
talk
with
bows
on
the
bridge
came
back
to
him
he
felt
quite
kindly
disposed
towards
his
two
old
friends
and
cordially
shook
the
hands
of
both
of
them
when
he
rose
to
go
away
he
had
quite
forgotten
about
little
fanny
bolton
whilst
the
captain
was
talking
and
pen
himself
was
absorbed
in
other
selfish
meditations
he
only
remembered
her
again
as
bows
came
hobbling
down
the
stairs
after
him
bent
evidently
upon
following
him
out
of
shepherd
inn
bows
precaution
was
not
a
lucky
one
the
wrath
of
arthur
pendennis
rose
at
the
poor
old
fellow
feeble
persecution
confound
him
what
does
he
mean
by
dogging
me
thought
pen
and
he
burst
out
laughing
when
he
was
in
the
strand
and
by
himself
as
he
thought
of
the
elder
stratagem
it
was
not
an
honest
laugh
arthur
pendennis
perhaps
the
thought
struck
arthur
himself
and
he
blushed
at
his
own
sense
of
humour
he
went
off
to
endeavour
to
banish
the
thoughts
which
occupied
him
whatever
those
thoughts
might
be
and
tried
various
places
of
amusement
with
but
indifferent
success
he
struggled
up
the
highest
stairs
of
the
panorama
but
when
he
had
arrived
panting
at
the
height
of
the
eminence
care
had
come
up
with
him
and
was
bearing
him
company
he
went
to
the
club
and
wrote
a
long
letter
home
exceedingly
witty
and
sarcastic
and
in
which
if
he
did
not
say
a
single
word
about
vauxhall
and
fanny
bolton
it
was
because
he
thought
that
subject
however
interesting
to
himself
would
not
be
very
interesting
to
his
mother
and
laura
nor
could
the
novels
or
the
library
table
fix
his
attention
nor
the
grave
and
respectable
jawkins
the
only
man
in
town
who
wished
to
engage
him
in
conversation
nor
any
of
the
amusements
which
he
tried
after
flying
from
jawkins
he
passed
a
comic
theatre
on
his
way
home
and
saw
farce
of
laughter
old
english
fun
and
frolic
placarded
in
vermilion
letters
on
the
gate
he
went
into
the
pit
and
saw
the
lovely
leary
as
usual
in
a
man
attire
and
that
eminent
buffo
actor
tom
horseman
dressed
as
a
woman
travesty
seemed
to
him
a
horrid
and
hideous
degradation
glances
and
ankles
had
not
the
least
effect
he
laughed
again
and
bitterly
to
himself
as
he
thought
of
the
effect
which
she
had
produced
upon
him
on
the
first
night
of
his
arrival
in
london
a
short
time
what
a
long
long
time
ago
chapter
or
near
the
temple
garden
fashion
has
long
deserted
the
green
and
pretty
temple
garden
which
in
shakespeare
makes
york
and
lancaster
to
pluck
the
innocent
white
and
red
roses
which
became
the
badges
of
their
bloody
wars
and
the
learned
and
pleasant
writer
of
the
handbook
of
london
tells
us
that
the
commonest
and
hardiest
kind
of
rose
has
long
ceased
to
put
forth
a
bud
in
that
smoky
air
not
many
of
the
present
occupiers
of
the
buildings
round
about
the
quarter
know
or
care
very
likely
whether
or
not
roses
grow
there
or
pass
the
old
gate
except
on
their
way
to

the
attorneys
clerks
do
carry
flowers
in
their
bags
or
posies
under
their
arms
as
they
run
to
the
counsel
chambers
the
few
lawyers
who
take
constitutional
walks
think
very
little
about
york
and
lancaster
especially
since
the
railroad
business
is
over

the
poetical
figures
live
in
our
memory
just
as
much
as
the
real
personages
and
as
arthur
pendennis
was
of
a
romantic
and
literary
turn
by
no
means
addicted
to
the
legal
pursuits
common
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
place
we
may
presume
that
he
was
cherishing
some
such
poetical
reflections
as
these
when
upon
the
evening
after
the
events
recorded
in
the
last
chapter
the
young
gentleman
chose
the
temple
gardens
as
a
place
for
exercise
and
meditation
on
the
sunday
evening
the
temple
is
commonly
calm
the
chambers
are
for
the
most
part
vacant
the
great
lawyers
are
giving
grand
at
their
houses
in
the
belgravian
or
tyburnian
districts
the
agreeable
young
barristers
are
absent
attending
those
parties
and
paying
their
respects
to
kewsy
excellent
claret
or
justice
accomplished
daughters
the
uninvited
are
partaking
of
the
economic
joint
and
the
modest
of
wine
at
the
club
entertaining
themselves
and
the
rest
of
the
company
in
the
with
circuit
jokes
and
points
of
wit
and
law
nobody
is
in
chambers
at
all
except
poor
cockle
who
is
ill
and
whose
laundress
is
making
him
gruel
or
toodle
who
is
an
amateur
of
the
flute
and
whom
you
may
hear
piping
solitary
from
his
chambers
in
the
second
floor
or
young
tiger
the
student
from
whose
open
windows
comes
a
great
gush
of
cigar
smoke
and
at
whose
door
are
a
quantity
of
dishes
and
covers
bearing
the
insignia
of
dicks
or
the
cock
but
stop
whither
does
fancy
lead
us
it
is
vacation
time
and
with
the
exception
of
pendennis
nobody
is
in
chambers
at
all
perhaps
it
was
solitude
then
which
drove
pen
into
the
garden
for
although
he
had
never
before
passed
the
gate
and
had
looked
rather
carelessly
at
the
pretty
and
the
groups
of
pleased
citizens
sauntering
over
the
trim
lawn
and
the
broad
by
the
river
on
this
evening
it
happened
as
we
have
said
that
the
young
gentleman
who
had
dined
alone
at
a
tavern
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
temple
took
a
fancy
as
he
was
returning
home
to
his
chambers
to
take
a
little
walk
in
the
gardens
and
enjoy
the
fresh
evening
air
and
the
sight
of
the
shining
thames
after
walking
for
a
brief
space
and
looking
at
the
many
peaceful
and
happy
groups
round
about
him
he
grew
tired
of
the
exercise
and
betook
himself
to
one
of
the
which
flank
either
end
of
the
main
walk
and
there
modestly
seated
himself
what
were
his
cogitations
the
evening
was
delightfully
bright
and
calm
the
sky
was
cloudless
the
chimneys
on
the
opposite
bank
were
not
smoking
the
wharfs
warehouses
looked
rosy
in
the
sunshine
and
as
clear
as
if
they
too
had
washed
for
the
holiday
the
steamers
rushed
rapidly
up
and
down
the
stream
laden
with
holiday
passengers
the
bells
of
the
multitudinous
city
churches
were
ringing
to
evening
prayers
such
peaceful
sabbath
evenings
as
this
pen
may
have
remembered
in
his
early
days
as
he
paced
with
his
arm
round
his
mother
waist
on
the
terrace
before
the
lawn
at
home
the
sun
was
lighting
up
the
little
brawl
too
as
well
as
the
broad
thames
and
sinking
downwards
majestically
behind
the
clavering
elms
and
the
tower
of
the
familiar
village
church
was
it
thoughts
of
these
or
the
sunset
merely
that
caused
the
blush
in
the
young
man
face
he
beat
time
on
the
bench
to
the
chorus
of
the
bells
without
flicked
the
dust
off
his
shining
boots
with
his
and
starting
up
stamped
with
his
foot
and
said
no
by
jove
i
go
and
with
this
resolution
which
indicated
that
some
struggle
as
to
the
propriety
of
remaining
where
he
was
or
of
quitting
the
garden
had
been
going
on
in
his
mind
he
stepped
out
of
the
he
nearly
knocked
down
two
little
children
who
did
not
indeed
reach
much
higher
than
his
knee
and
were
trotting
along
the
with
their
long
blue
shadows
slanting
towards
the
east
one
cried
out
oh
the
other
began
to
laugh
and
with
a
knowing
little
infantile
chuckle
said
missa
pendennis
and
arthur
looking
down
saw
his
two
little
friends
of
the
day
before
mesdemoiselles
and
he
blushed
more
than
ever
at
seeing
them
and
seizing
the
one
whom
he
had
nearly
upset
jumped
her
up
into
the
air
and
kissed
her
at
which
sudden
assault
began
to
cry
in
great
alarm
this
cry
brought
up
instantly
two
ladies
in
clean
collars
and
new
ribbons
and
grand
shawls
namely
bolton
in
a
rich
scarlet
caledonian
cashmere
and
a
black
silk
dress
and
miss
bolton
with
a
yellow
scarf
and
a
sweet
sprigged
muslin
and
a
parasol
quite
the
lady
fanny
did
not
say
one
single
word
though
her
eyes
flashed
a
welcome
and
shone
as
bright
as
bright
as
the
most
blazing
windows
in
paper
buildings
but
bolton
after
admonishing
said
lor
sir
how
very
odd
that
we
should
meet
you
year
i
ope
you
ave
your
ealth
well
ai
it
odd
fanny
that
we
should
meet
pendennis
what
do
you
mean
by
sniggering
mesdames
when
young
croesus
has
been
staying
at
a
have
you
never
by
any
singular
coincidence
been
walking
with
your
fanny
in
the
shrubberies
have
you
and
your
fanny
never
happened
to
be
listening
to
the
band
of
the
heavies
at
brighton
when
young
de
boots
and
captain
padmore
came
clinking
down
the
pier
have
you
and
your
darling
frances
never
chanced
to
be
visiting
old
widow
wheezy
at
the
cottage
on
the
common
when
the
young
curate
has
stepped
in
with
a
tract
adapted
to
the
rheumatism
do
you
suppose
that
if
singular
coincidences
occur
at
the
hall
they
do
also
happen
at
the
lodge
it
was
a
coincidence
no
doubt
that
was
all
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
on
the
day
previous
pendennis
had
merely
said
in
the
simplest
way
imaginable
and
in
reply
to
a
question
of
miss
bolton
that
although
some
of
the
courts
were
gloomy
parts
of
the
temple
were
very
cheerful
and
agreeable
especially
the
chambers
looking
on
the
river
and
around
the
gardens
and
that
the
gardens
were
a
very
pleasant
walk
on
sunday
evenings
and
frequented
by
a
great
number
of
people
and
here
by
the
merest
chance
all
our
acquaintances
met
together
just
like
so
many
people
in
genteel
life
what
could
be
more
artless
or
natural
pen
looked
very
grave
pompous
and
dandified
he
was
unusually
smart
and
brilliant
in
his
costume
his
white
duck
trousers
and
white
hat
his
neckcloth
of
many
colours
his
light
waistcoat
gold
chains
and
gave
him
the
air
of
a
prince
of
the
blood
at
least
how
his
splendour
became
his
figure
was
anybody
ever
like
him
some
one
thought
he
blushed
how
his
blushes
became
him
the
same
individual
said
to
herself
the
children
on
seeing
him
the
day
before
had
been
so
struck
with
him
that
after
he
had
gone
away
they
had
been
playing
at
him
and
sticking
her
little
chubby
fingers
into
the
of
her
pinafore
as
pen
was
wont
to
do
with
his
waistcoat
had
said
now
i
be
missa
fanny
had
laughed
till
she
cried
and
smothered
her
sister
with
kisses
for
that
feat
how
happy
too
she
was
to
see
arthur
embracing
the
child
if
arthur
was
red
fanny
on
the
contrary
was
very
worn
and
pale
arthur
remarked
it
and
asked
kindly
why
she
looked
so
fatigued
i
was
awake
all
night
said
fanny
and
began
to
blush
a
little
i
put
out
her
candle
and
hordered
her
to
go
to
sleep
and
leave
off
readin
interposed
the
fond
mother
you
were
reading
and
what
was
it
that
interested
you
so
asked
pen
amused
oh
it
so
beautiful
said
fanny
what
lorraine
fanny
sighed
out
how
i
do
hate
that
neaera
neaera
i
do
know
the
pronunciation
and
i
love
leonora
and
walter
oh
how
dear
he
is
how
had
fanny
discovered
the
novel
of
lorraine
and
that
pen
was
the
author
this
little
person
remembered
every
single
word
which
pendennis
had
spoken
on
the
night
previous
and
how
he
wrote
in
books
and
newspapers
what
books
she
was
so
eager
to
know
that
she
had
almost
a
mind
to
be
civil
to
old
bows
who
was
suffering
under
her
displeasure
since
yesterday
but
she
determined
first
to
make
application
to
costigan
she
began
by
coaxing
the
captain
and
smiling
upon
him
in
her
most
winning
way
as
she
helped
to
arrange
his
dinner
and
set
his
humble
apartment
in
order
she
was
sure
his
linen
wanted
mending
and
indeed
the
captain
contained
some
curious
specimens
of
manufactured
flax
and
cotton
she
would
mend
his
shirts
all
his
shirts
what
horrid
holes
what
funny
holes
she
put
her
little
face
through
one
of
them
and
laughed
at
the
old
warrior
in
the
most
winning
manner
she
would
have
made
a
funny
little
picture
looking
through
the
holes
then
she
daintily
removed
costigan
dinner
things
tripping
about
the
room
as
she
had
seen
the
dancers
do
at
the
play
and
she
danced
to
the
captain
cupboard
and
produced
his
and
mixed
him
a
tumbler
and
must
taste
a
drop
of
it
a
little
drop
and
the
captain
must
sing
her
one
of
his
songs
his
dear
songs
and
teach
it
to
her
and
when
he
had
sung
an
irish
melody
in
his
rich
quavering
voice
fancying
it
was
he
who
was
fascinating
the
little
siren
she
put
her
little
question
about
arthur
pendennis
and
his
novel
and
having
got
an
answer
cared
for
nothing
more
but
left
the
captain
at
the
piano
about
to
sing
her
another
song
and
the
on
the
passage
and
the
shirts
on
the
chair
and
ran
downstairs
quickening
her
pace
as
she
sped
captain
costigan
as
he
said
was
not
a
litherary
cyarkter
nor
had
he
as
yet
found
time
to
peruse
his
young
friend
ellygant
perfaurumance
though
he
intended
to
teak
an
early
opporchunitee
of
purchasing
a
cawpee
of
his
work
but
he
knew
the
name
of
pen
novel
from
the
fact
that
finucane
bludyer
and
other
frequenters
of
the
back
kitchen
spoke
of
pendennis
and
not
all
of
them
with
great
friendship
for
bludyer
called
him
a
confounded
coxcomb
and
hoolan
wondered
that
doolan
did
not
kick
him
etc
by
the
sobriquet
of
walter
lorraine
and
was
hence
enabled
to
give
fanny
the
information
which
she
required
and
she
went
and
ast
for
it
at
the
libery
bolton
said
several
liberies
and
some
ad
it
and
it
was
bout
and
some
ad
it
and
one
of
the
liberies
as
ad
it
would
let
er
ave
it
without
a
sovering
and
she
ad
one
and
she
came
back
to
me
did
you
fanny
and
i
gave
her
a
and
oh
i
was
in
such
a
fright
lest
any
one
should
have
come
to
the
libery
and
took
it
while
i
was
away
fanny
said
her
cheeks
and
eyes
glowing
and
oh
i
do
like
it
so
arthur
was
touched
by
this
artless
sympathy
immensely
flattered
and
moved
by
it
do
you
like
it
he
said
if
you
will
come
up
to
my
chambers
i
will
no
i
will
bring
you
one
no
i
will
send
you
one
good
night
thank
you
fanny
god
bless
you
i
must
stay
with
you
and
pressing
her
hand
once
and
nodding
to
her
mother
and
the
other
children
he
strode
out
of
the
gardens
he
quickened
his
pace
as
he
went
from
them
and
ran
out
of
the
gate
talking
to
himself
dear
dear
little
thing
he
said
darling
little
fanny
you
are
worth
them
all
i
wish
to
heaven
shandon
was
back
i
go
home
to
my
mother
i
must
see
her
i
wo
i
wo
so
help
me
as
he
was
talking
thus
and
running
the
turning
to
look
at
him
he
ran
against
a
little
old
man
and
perceived
it
was
bows
your
very
umble
servant
sir
said
bows
making
a
sarcastic
bow
and
lifting
his
old
hat
from
his
forehead
i
wish
you
a
good
day
arthur
answered
sulkily
do
let
me
detain
you
or
give
you
the
trouble
to
follow
me
again
i
am
in
a
hurry
sir
good
bows
thought
pen
had
some
reason
for
hurrying
to
his
rooms
where
are
they
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
you
know
whom
i
mean
they
not
in
your
rooms
sir
are
they
they
told
bolton
they
were
going
to
church
at
the
temple
they
were
there
they
are
in
your
chambers
they
must
stay
in
your
chambers
damn
it
sir
cried
out
pendennis
fiercely
come
and
see
if
they
are
in
my
chambers
here
the
court
and
the
door
come
in
and
and
bows
taking
off
his
hat
and
bowing
first
followed
the
young
man
they
were
not
in
pen
chambers
as
we
know
but
when
the
gardens
were
closed
the
two
women
who
had
had
but
a
melancholy
amusement
walked
away
sadly
with
the
children
and
they
entered
into
lamb
court
and
stood
under
the
which
cheerfully
ornaments
the
centre
of
that
quadrangle
and
looked
up
to
the
third
floor
of
the
house
where
pendennis
chambers
were
and
where
they
saw
a
light
presently
kindled
then
this
couple
of
fools
went
away
the
children
dragging
wearily
after
them
and
returned
to
bolton
who
was
immersed
in
at
his
lodge
in
shepherd
inn
bows
looked
round
the
blank
room
which
the
young
man
occupied
and
which
had
received
but
very
few
ornaments
or
additions
since
the
last
time
we
saw
them
warrington
old
bookcase
and
battered
library
with
its
litter
of
papers
presented
an
aspect
cheerless
enough
will
you
like
to
look
in
the
bedrooms
bows
and
see
if
my
victims
are
there
he
said
bitterly
or
whether
i
have
made
away
with
the
little
girls
and
hid
them
in
the
your
word
is
sufficient
pendennis
the
other
said
in
his
sad
tone
you
say
they
are
not
here
and
i
know
they
are
not
and
i
hope
they
never
have
been
here
and
never
will
upon
my
word
sir
you
are
very
good
to
choose
my
acquaintances
for
me
arthur
said
in
a
haughty
tone
and
to
suppose
that
anybody
would
be
the
worse
for
my
society
i
remember
you
and
owe
you
kindness
from
old
times
bows
or
i
should
speak
more
angrily
than
i
do
about
a
very
intolerable
sort
of
persecution
to
which
you
seem
inclined
to
subject
me
you
followed
me
out
of
your
inn
yesterday
as
if
you
wanted
to
watch
that
i
should
steal
here
pen
stammered
and
turned
red
directly
he
had
said
the
words
he
felt
he
had
given
the
other
an
opening
which
bows
instantly
took
i
do
think
you
came
to
steal
something
as
you
say
the
words
sir
bows
said
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
came
to
pay
a
visit
to
poor
old
bows
the
fiddler
or
to
bolton
at
the
porter
lodge
o
fie
such
a
fine
gentleman
as
arthur
pendennis
esquire
does
condescend
to
walk
up
to
my
garret
or
to
sit
in
a
laundress
kitchen
but
for
reasons
of
his
own
and
my
belief
is
that
you
came
to
steal
a
pretty
girl
heart
away
and
to
ruin
it
and
to
spurn
it
afterwards
arthur
pendennis
that
what
the
world
makes
of
you
young
dandies
you
gentlemen
of
fashion
you
high
and
mighty
aristocrats
that
trample
upon
the
people
it
sport
to
you
but
what
is
it
to
the
poor
think
you
the
toys
of
your
pleasures
whom
you
play
with
and
whom
you
fling
into
the
streets
when
you
are
tired
i
know
your
order
sir
i
know
your
selfishness
and
your
arrogance
and
your
pride
what
does
it
matter
to
my
lord
that
the
poor
man
daughter
is
made
miserable
and
her
family
brought
to
shame
you
must
have
your
pleasures
and
the
people
of
course
must
pay
for
them
what
are
we
made
for
but
for
that
it
the
way
with
you
all
the
way
with
you
all
bows
was
speaking
beside
the
question
and
pen
had
his
advantage
here
which
he
was
not
sorry
to
take
not
sorry
to
put
off
the
debate
from
the
point
upon
which
his
adversary
had
first
engaged
it
arthur
broke
out
with
a
sort
of
laugh
for
which
he
asked
bows
pardon
yes
i
am
an
aristocrat
he
said
in
a
palace
up
three
pair
of
stairs
with
a
carpet
nearly
as
handsome
as
yours
bows
my
life
is
passed
in
grinding
the
people
is
it
in
ruining
virgins
and
robbing
the
poor
my
good
sir
this
is
very
well
in
a
comedy
where
job
thornberry
slaps
his
breast
and
asks
my
lord
how
dare
he
trample
on
an
honest
man
and
poke
out
an
englishman
fireside
but
in
real
life
bows
to
a
man
who
has
to
work
for
his
bread
as
much
as
you
do
how
can
you
talk
about
aristocrats
tyrannising
over
the
people
have
i
ever
done
you
a
wrong
or
assumed
airs
of
superiority
over
you
did
you
not
have
an
early
regard
for
me
in
days
when
we
were
both
of
us
romantic
young
fellows
bows
come
do
be
angry
with
me
now
and
let
us
be
as
good
friends
as
we
were
those
days
were
very
different
bows
answered
and
arthur
pendennis
was
an
honest
impetuous
young
fellow
then
rather
selfish
and
conceited
perhaps
but
honest
he
liked
you
then
because
you
were
ready
to
ruin
yourself
for
a
and
now
sir
arthur
asked
and
now
times
are
changed
and
you
want
a
woman
to
ruin
herself
for
you
bows
answered
i
know
this
child
sir
i
always
said
this
lot
was
hanging
over
her
she
has
heated
her
little
brain
with
novels
until
her
whole
thoughts
are
about
love
and
lovers
and
she
scarcely
sees
that
she
treads
on
a
kitchen
floor
i
have
taught
the
little
thing
she
is
full
of
many
talents
and
winning
ways
i
grant
you
i
am
fond
of
the
girl
sir
i
a
lonely
old
man
i
lead
a
life
that
i
do
like
among
boon
companions
who
make
me
melancholy
i
have
but
this
child
that
i
care
for
have
pity
upon
me
and
do
take
her
away
from
me
pendennis
do
take
her
the
old
man
voice
broke
as
he
spoke
its
accents
touched
pen
much
more
than
the
menacing
or
sarcastic
tone
which
bows
had
commenced
by
adopting
indeed
said
he
kindly
you
do
me
a
wrong
if
you
fancy
i
intend
one
to
poor
little
fanny
i
never
saw
her
till
friday
night
it
was
the
merest
chance
that
our
friend
costigan
threw
her
into
my
way
i
have
no
intentions
regarding
her
that
is
that
is
you
know
very
well
that
she
is
a
foolish
girl
and
her
mother
a
foolish
woman
that
is
you
meet
her
in
the
temple
gardens
and
of
course
without
previous
concert
that
is
that
when
i
found
her
yesterday
reading
the
book
you
wrote
she
scorned
me
bows
said
what
am
i
good
for
but
to
be
laughed
at
a
deformed
old
fellow
like
me
an
old
fiddler
that
wears
a
threadbare
coat
and
gets
his
bread
by
playing
tunes
at
an
you
are
a
fine
gentleman
you
are
you
wear
scent
in
your
handkerchief
and
a
ring
on
your
finger
you
go
to
dine
with
great
people
who
ever
gives
a
crust
to
old
bows
and
yet
i
might
have
been
as
good
a
man
as
the
best
of
you
i
might
have
been
a
man
of
genius
if
i
had
had
the
chance
ay
and
have
lived
with
the
of
the
land
but
everything
had
failed
with
me
ambition
once
and
wrote
plays
poems
music
nobody
would
give
me
a
hearing
i
never
loved
a
woman
but
she
laughed
at
me
and
here
i
am
in
my
old
age
alone
alone
do
take
this
girl
from
me
pendennis
i
say
again
leave
her
with
me
a
little
longer
she
was
like
a
child
to
me
till
yesterday
why
did
you
step
in
and
made
her
to
mock
my
deformity
and
old
age
i
am
guiltless
of
that
at
least
arthur
said
with
something
of
a
sigh
upon
my
word
of
honour
i
wish
i
had
never
seen
the
girl
my
calling
is
not
seduction
bows
i
did
not
imagine
that
i
had
made
an
impression
on
poor
fanny
until
until
and
then
sir
i
was
sorry
and
was
flying
from
my
temptation
as
you
came
upon
me
and
he
added
with
a
glow
upon
his
cheek
which
in
the
gathering
darkness
his
companion
could
not
see
and
with
an
audible
tremor
in
his
voice
i
do
not
mind
telling
you
sir
that
on
this
sabbath
evening
as
the
church
bells
were
ringing
i
thought
of
my
own
home
and
of
women
angelically
pure
and
good
who
dwell
there
and
i
was
running
hither
as
i
met
you
that
i
might
avoid
the
danger
which
beset
me
and
ask
strength
of
god
almighty
to
do
my
after
these
words
from
arthur
a
silence
ensued
and
when
the
conversation
was
resumed
by
his
guest
the
latter
spoke
in
a
tone
which
was
much
more
gentle
and
friendly
and
on
taking
farewell
of
pen
bows
asked
leave
to
shake
hands
with
him
and
with
a
very
warm
and
affectionate
greeting
on
both
sides
apologised
to
arthur
for
having
mistaken
him
and
paid
him
some
compliments
which
caused
the
young
man
to
squeeze
his
old
friend
hand
heartily
again
and
as
they
parted
at
pen
door
arthur
said
he
had
given
a
promise
and
he
hoped
and
trusted
that
bows
might
rely
on
it
amen
to
that
prayer
said
bows
and
went
slowly
down
the
stair
chapter
li
the
happy
village
again
early
in
this
history
we
have
had
occasion
to
speak
of
the
little
town
of
clavering
near
which
pen
paternal
home
of
fairoaks
stood
and
of
some
of
the
people
who
inhabite
the
place
and
as
the
society
there
was
by
no
means
amusing
or
pleasant
our
reports
concerning
it
were
not
carried
to
any
very
great
length
samuel
huxter
the
gentleman
whose
acquaintance
we
lately
made
at
vauxhall
was
one
of
the
choice
spirits
of
the
little
town
when
he
visited
it
during
his
vacation
and
enlivened
the
tables
of
his
friends
there
by
the
wit
of
and
the
gossip
of
the
fashionable
london
circles
which
he
frequented
hobnell
the
young
gentleman
whom
pen
had
thrashed
in
consequence
of
the
quarrel
in
the
fotheringay
affair
was
whilst
a
pupil
at
the
grammar
school
at
clavering
made
very
welcome
at
the
of
huxter
samuel
mother
and
was
free
of
the
surgery
where
he
knew
the
way
to
the
and
could
scent
his
with
and
it
was
at
this
period
of
his
life
that
he
formed
an
attachment
for
miss
sophy
huxter
whom
on
his
father
demise
he
married
and
took
home
to
his
house
of
the
warren
at
a
few
miles
from
clavering
the
family
had
possessed
and
cultivated
an
estate
there
for
many
years
as
yeomen
and
farmers
hobnell
father
pulled
down
the
old
farmhouse
built
a
flaring
new
whitewashed
mansion
with
capacious
stables
and
a
piano
in
the
kept
a
pack
of
harriers
and
assumed
the
title
of
squire
hobnell
when
he
died
and
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
the
family
might
be
fairly
considered
to
be
established
as
county
gentry
and
sam
huxter
at
london
did
no
great
wrong
in
boasting
about
his
place
his
hounds
horses
and
hospitality
to
his
admiring
comrades
at
bartholomew
every
year
at
a
time
commonly
when
hobnell
could
not
leave
the
increasing
duties
of
her
nursery
hobnell
came
up
to
london
for
a
lark
had
rooms
at
the
tavistock
and
he
and
sam
indulged
in
the
pleasures
of
the
town
together
ascot
the
theatres
vauxhall
and
the
convivial
taverns
in
the
joyous
neighbourhood
of
covent
garden
were
visited
by
the
vivacious
squire
in
company
with
his
learned
brother
when
he
was
in
london
as
he
said
he
liked
to
do
as
london
does
and
to
go
it
a
bit
and
when
he
returned
to
the
west
he
took
a
new
bonnet
and
shawl
to
hobnell
and
relinquished
for
country
sports
and
occupations
during
the
next
eleven
months
the
elegant
amusements
of
london
life
sam
huxter
kept
up
a
correspondence
with
his
relative
and
supplied
him
with
choice
news
of
the
metropolis
in
return
for
the
baskets
of
hares
partridges
and
clouted
cream
which
the
squire
and
his
wife
forwarded
to
sam
a
youth
more
brilliant
and
distinguished
they
did
not
know
he
was
the
life
and
soul
of
their
house
when
he
made
his
appearance
in
his
native
place
his
songs
jokes
and
fun
kept
the
warren
in
a
roar
he
had
saved
their
eldest
darling
life
by
taking
a
out
of
her
throat
in
fine
he
was
the
delight
of
their
circle
as
would
have
it
pen
again
fell
in
with
huxter
only
three
days
after
the
rencontre
at
vauxhall
faithful
to
his
vow
he
had
not
been
to
see
little
fanny
he
was
trying
to
drive
her
from
his
mind
by
occupation
or
other
mental
excitement
he
laboured
though
not
to
much
profit
incessantly
in
his
rooms
and
in
his
capacity
of
critic
for
the
pall
mall
gazette
made
woeful
and
savage
onslaught
on
a
poem
and
a
romance
which
came
before
him
for
judgment
these
authors
slain
he
went
to
dine
alone
at
the
lonely
club
of
the
polyanthus
where
the
vast
solitudes
frightened
him
and
made
him
only
the
more
moody
he
had
been
to
more
theatres
for
relaxation
the
whole
house
was
roaring
with
laughter
and
applause
and
he
saw
only
an
ignoble
farce
that
made
him
sad
it
would
have
damped
the
spirits
of
the
buffoon
on
the
stage
to
have
seen
pen
dismal
face
he
hardly
knew
what
was
happening
the
scene
and
the
drama
passed
before
him
like
a
dream
or
a
fever
then
he
thought
he
would
go
to
the
back
kitchen
his
old
haunt
with
warrington
he
was
not
a
bit
sleepy
yet
the
day
before
he
had
walked
twenty
miles
in
search
after
rest
over
hampstead
common
and
hendon
lanes
and
had
got
no
sleep
at
night
he
would
go
to
the
back
kitchen
it
was
a
sort
of
comfort
to
him
to
think
he
should
see
bows
bows
was
there
very
calm
presiding
at
the
old
piano
some
tremendous
comic
songs
were
sung
which
made
the
room
crack
with
laughter
how
strange
they
seemed
to
pen
he
could
only
see
bows
in
an
extinct
volcano
such
as
he
boasted
that
his
breast
was
it
was
wonderful
how
he
should
feel
such
a
flame
two
days
indulgence
had
kindled
it
two
days
abstinence
had
set
it
burning
in
fury
so
musing
upon
this
and
drinking
down
one
glass
after
another
as
ill
luck
would
have
it
arthur
eyes
lighted
upon
huxter
who
had
been
to
the
theatre
like
himself
and
with
two
or
three
comrades
now
entered
the
room
huxter
whispered
to
his
companions
greatly
to
pen
annoyance
arthur
felt
that
the
other
was
talking
about
him
huxter
then
worked
through
the
room
followed
by
his
friends
and
came
and
took
a
place
opposite
pen
nodding
familiarly
to
him
and
holding
him
out
a
dirty
hand
to
shake
pen
shook
hands
with
his
he
thought
he
had
been
needlessly
savage
to
him
on
the
last
night
when
they
had
met
as
for
huxter
perfectly
at
with
himself
and
the
world
it
never
entered
his
mind
that
he
could
be
disagreeable
to
anybody
and
the
little
dispute
or
chaff
as
he
styled
it
of
vauxhall
was
a
trifle
which
he
did
not
in
the
least
regard
the
disciple
of
galen
having
called
for
four
stouts
with
which
he
and
his
party
refreshed
themselves
began
to
think
what
would
be
the
most
amusing
topic
of
conversation
with
pen
and
hit
upon
that
precise
one
which
was
most
painful
to
our
young
gentleman
jolly
night
at
vauxhall
was
it
he
said
and
winked
in
a
very
knowing
way
i
glad
you
liked
it
poor
pen
said
groaning
in
spirit
i
was
cut
uncommon
been
dining
with
some
chaps
at
greenwich
that
was
a
pretty
bit
of
muslin
hanging
on
your
arm
who
was
she
asked
the
fascinating
student
the
question
was
too
much
for
arthur
have
i
asked
you
any
questions
about
yourself
huxter
he
said
i
did
mean
any
offence
beg
pardon
hang
it
you
cut
up
quite
savage
said
pen
astonished
interlocutor
do
you
remember
what
took
place
between
us
the
other
night
pen
asked
with
gathering
wrath
you
forget
very
probably
you
were
tipsy
as
you
observed
just
now
and
very
hang
it
sir
i
asked
your
pardon
huxter
said
looking
red
you
did
certainly
and
it
was
granted
with
all
my
heart
i
am
sure
but
if
you
recollect
i
begged
that
you
would
have
the
goodness
to
omit
me
from
the
list
of
your
acquaintance
for
the
future
and
when
we
met
in
public
that
you
would
not
take
the
trouble
to
recognise
me
will
you
please
to
remember
this
hereafter
and
as
the
song
is
beginning
permit
me
to
leave
you
to
the
unrestrained
enjoyment
of
the
he
took
his
hat
and
making
a
bow
to
the
amazed
huxter
left
the
table
as
huxter
comrades
after
a
pause
of
wonder
set
up
such
a
roar
of
laughter
at
huxter
as
called
for
the
intervention
of
the
president
of
the
room
who
bawled
out
silence
gentlemen
do
have
silence
for
the
body
snatcher
which
popular
song
began
as
pen
left
the
back
kitchen
he
flattered
himself
that
he
had
commanded
his
temper
perfectly
he
rather
wished
that
huxter
had
been
pugnacious
he
would
have
liked
to
fight
him
or
somebody
he
went
home
the
day
work
the
dinner
the
play
the
the
quarrel
nothing
soothed
him
he
slept
no
better
than
on
the
previous
night
a
few
days
afterwards
sam
huxter
wrote
home
a
letter
to
hobnell
in
the
country
of
which
arthur
pendennis
formed
the
principal
subject
sam
described
arthur
pursuits
in
london
and
his
confounded
insolence
of
behaviour
to
his
old
friends
from
home
he
said
he
was
an
abandoned
criminal
a
regular
don
juan
a
fellow
who
when
he
did
come
into
the
country
ought
to
be
kept
out
of
honest
people
houses
he
had
seen
him
at
vauxhall
dancing
with
an
innocent
girl
in
the
lower
ranks
of
life
of
whom
he
was
making
a
victim
he
had
found
out
from
an
irish
gentleman
formerly
in
the
army
who
frequented
a
club
of
which
he
huxter
was
member
who
the
girl
was
on
whom
this
conceited
humbug
was
practising
his
infernal
arts
and
he
thought
he
should
warn
her
father
etc
the
letter
then
touched
on
general
news
conveyed
the
writer
thanks
for
the
last
parcel
and
the
rabbits
and
hinted
his
extreme
readiness
for
further
favours
about
once
a
year
as
we
have
stated
there
was
occasion
for
a
christening
at
the
warren
and
it
happened
that
this
ceremony
took
place
a
day
after
hobnell
had
received
the
letter
of
his
in
town
the
infant
a
darling
little
girl
was
christened
myra
lucretia
after
its
two
godmothers
miss
portman
and
pybus
of
clavering
and
as
of
course
hobnell
had
communicated
sam
letter
to
his
wife
hobnell
imparted
its
horrid
contents
to
her
two
gossips
a
pretty
story
it
was
and
prettily
it
was
told
throughout
clavering
in
the
course
of
that
day
myra
did
not
she
was
too
much
shocked
to
do
so
speak
on
the
matter
to
her
mamma
but
pybus
had
no
such
feelings
of
reserve
she
talked
over
the
matter
not
only
with
portman
but
with
and
the
honourable
simcoe
with
glanders
her
daughters
being
to
that
end
ordered
out
of
the
room
with
madame
fribsby
and
in
a
word
with
the
whole
of
the
clavering
society
madame
fribsby
looking
furtively
up
at
her
picture
of
the
dragoon
and
inwards
into
her
own
wounded
memory
said
that
men
would
be
men
and
as
long
as
they
were
men
would
be
deceivers
and
she
pensively
quoted
some
lines
from
marmion
requesting
to
know
where
deceiving
lovers
should
rest
pybus
had
no
words
of
hatred
horror
contempt
strong
enough
for
a
villain
who
could
be
capable
of
conduct
so
base
this
was
what
came
of
early
indulgence
and
insolence
and
extravagance
and
aristocratic
airs
it
is
certain
that
pen
had
refused
to
drink
tea
with
pybus
and
attending
the
corrupt
and
horrid
parties
in
the
dreadful
modern
babylon
portman
was
afraid
that
she
must
acknowledge
that
the
mother
fatal
partiality
had
spoiled
this
boy
that
his
literary
successes
had
turned
his
head
and
his
horrid
passions
had
made
him
forget
the
principles
which
doctor
portman
had
instilled
into
him
in
early
life
glanders
the
atrocious
captain
of
dragoons
when
informed
of
the
occurrence
by
glanders
whistled
and
made
jocular
allusions
to
it
at
on
which
glanders
called
him
a
brute
and
ordered
the
girls
again
out
of
the
room
as
the
horrid
captain
burst
out
laughing
simcoe
was
calm
under
the
intelligence
but
rather
pleased
than
otherwise
it
only
served
to
confirm
the
opinion
which
he
had
always
had
of
that
wretched
young
man
not
that
he
knew
anything
about
him
not
that
he
had
read
one
line
of
his
dangerous
and
poisonous
works
heaven
forbid
that
he
should
but
what
could
be
expected
from
such
a
youth
and
such
frightful
such
lamentable
such
deplorable
want
of
seriousness
pen
formed
the
subject
for
a
second
sermon
at
the
clavering
where
the
dangers
of
london
and
the
crime
of
reading
or
writing
novels
were
pointed
out
on
a
sunday
evening
to
a
large
and
warm
congregation
they
did
not
wait
to
hear
whether
he
was
guilty
or
not
they
took
his
wickedness
for
granted
and
with
these
admirable
moralists
it
was
who
should
fling
the
stone
at
poor
pen
the
next
day
pendennis
alone
and
almost
fainting
with
emotion
and
fatigue
walked
or
rather
ran
to
portman
house
to
consult
the
good
doctor
she
had
had
an
anonymous
letter
some
christian
had
thought
it
his
or
her
duty
to
stab
the
good
soul
who
had
never
done
mortal
a
wrong
an
anonymous
letter
with
references
to
scripture
pointing
out
the
doom
of
such
sinners
and
a
detailed
account
of
pen
crime
she
was
in
a
state
of
terror
and
excitement
pitiable
to
witness
two
or
three
hours
of
this
pain
had
aged
her
already
in
her
first
moment
of
agitation
she
had
dropped
the
letter
and
laura
had
read
it
laura
blushed
when
she
read
it
her
whole
frame
trembled
but
it
was
with
anger
the
cowards
she
it
is
no
mother
it
it
is
true
and
you
done
it
laura
cried
out
helen
fiercely
why
did
you
refuse
him
when
he
asked
you
why
did
you
break
my
heart
and
refuse
him
it
is
you
who
led
him
into
crime
it
is
you
who
flung
him
into
the
arms
of
this
this
do
speak
to
do
answer
me
i
will
never
forgive
you
never
martha
bring
me
my
bonnet
and
shawl
i
go
out
i
wo
have
you
come
with
me
go
away
leave
me
cruel
girl
why
have
you
brought
this
shame
on
me
and
bidding
her
daughter
and
her
servants
keep
away
from
her
she
ran
down
the
road
to
clavering
doctor
portman
glancing
over
the
letter
thought
he
knew
the
handwriting
and
of
course
was
already
acquainted
with
the
charge
made
against
poor
pen
against
his
own
conscience
perhaps
for
the
worthy
doctor
like
most
of
us
had
a
considerable
natural
aptitude
for
receiving
any
report
unfavourable
to
his
neighbours
he
strove
to
console
helen
he
pointed
out
that
the
slander
came
from
an
anonymous
quarter
and
therefore
must
be
the
work
of
a
rascal
that
the
charge
might
not
be
true
was
not
true
most
likely
at
least
that
pen
must
be
heard
before
he
was
condemned
that
the
son
of
such
a
mother
was
not
likely
to
commit
such
a
crime
etc
etc
helen
at
once
saw
through
his
feint
of
objection
and
denial
you
think
he
has
done
it
she
said
you
know
you
think
he
has
done
it
oh
why
did
i
ever
leave
him
doctor
portman
or
suffer
him
away
from
me
but
he
ca
be
dishonest
pray
god
not
dishonest
you
do
think
that
do
you
remember
his
conduct
about
that
other
person
how
madly
he
was
attached
to
her
he
was
an
honest
boy
then
he
is
now
and
i
thank
god
yes
i
fall
down
on
my
knees
and
thank
god
he
paid
laura
you
said
he
was
good
you
did
yourself
and
now
if
this
woman
loves
him
and
you
know
they
must
if
he
has
taken
her
from
her
home
or
she
tempted
him
which
is
most
likely
why
still
she
must
be
his
wife
and
my
daughter
and
he
must
leave
the
dreadful
world
and
come
back
to
me
to
his
mother
doctor
portman
let
us
go
away
and
bring
him
back
yes
bring
him
back
and
there
shall
be
joy
for
the
the
sinner
that
repenteth
let
us
go
now
directly
dear
friend
this
very
helen
could
say
no
more
she
fell
back
and
fainted
she
was
carried
to
a
bed
in
the
house
of
the
pitying
doctor
and
the
surgeon
was
called
to
attend
her
she
lay
all
night
in
an
alarming
state
laura
came
to
her
or
to
the
rectory
rather
for
she
would
not
see
laura
and
doctor
portman
still
beseeching
her
to
be
tranquil
and
growing
bolder
and
more
confident
of
arthur
innocence
as
he
witnessed
the
terrible
grief
of
the
poor
mother
wrote
a
letter
to
pen
warning
him
of
the
rumours
that
were
against
him
and
earnestly
praying
that
he
would
break
off
and
repent
of
a
connexion
so
fatal
to
his
best
interests
and
his
welfare
and
laura
was
her
heart
not
wrung
by
the
thought
of
arthur
crime
and
helen
estrangement
was
it
not
a
bitter
blow
for
the
innocent
girl
to
think
that
at
one
stroke
she
should
lose
all
the
love
which
she
cared
for
in
the
world
chapter
lii
which
had
very
nearly
been
the
last
of
the
story
doctor
portman
letter
was
sent
off
to
its
destination
in
london
and
the
worthy
clergyman
endeavoured
to
soothe
down
pendennis
into
some
state
of
composure
until
an
answer
should
arrive
which
the
doctor
tried
to
think
or
at
any
rate
persisted
in
saying
would
be
satisfactory
as
regarded
the
morality
of
mr
pen
at
least
helen
wisdom
of
moving
upon
london
and
appearing
in
person
to
warn
her
son
of
his
wickedness
was
impracticable
for
a
day
or
two
the
apothecary
forbade
her
moving
even
so
far
as
fairoaks
for
the
first
day
and
it
was
not
until
the
subsequent
morning
that
she
found
herself
again
back
on
her
sofa
at
home
with
the
faithful
though
silent
laura
nursing
at
her
side
unluckily
for
himself
and
all
parties
pen
never
read
that
homily
which
doctor
portman
addressed
to
him
until
many
weeks
after
the
epistle
had
been
composed
and
day
after
day
the
widow
waited
for
her
son
reply
to
the
charges
against
him
her
own
illness
increasing
with
every
delay
it
was
a
hard
task
for
laura
to
bear
the
anxiety
to
witness
her
dearest
friend
suffering
worst
of
all
to
support
estrangement
and
the
pain
caused
to
her
by
that
averted
affection
but
it
was
the
custom
of
this
young
lady
to
the
utmost
of
her
power
and
by
means
of
that
gracious
assistance
which
heaven
awarded
to
her
pure
and
constant
prayers
to
do
her
duty
and
as
that
duty
was
performed
quite
noiselessly
while
the
supplications
which
endowed
her
with
the
requisite
strength
for
fulfilling
it
also
took
place
in
her
own
chamber
away
from
all
mortal
sight
we
too
must
be
perforce
silent
about
these
virtues
of
hers
which
no
more
bear
public
talking
about
than
a
flower
will
bear
to
bloom
in
a
ballroom
this
only
we
will
say
that
a
good
woman
is
the
loveliest
flower
that
blooms
under
heaven
and
that
we
look
with
love
and
wonder
upon
its
silent
grace
its
pure
fragrance
its
delicate
bloom
of
beauty
sweet
and
beautiful
the
fairest
and
the
most
spotless
is
it
not
pity
to
see
them
bowed
down
or
devoured
by
grief
or
death
inexorable
wasting
in
disease
pining
with
long
pain
or
cut
off
by
sudden
fate
in
their
prime
we
may
deserve
grief
but
why
should
these
be
unhappy
except
that
we
know
that
heaven
chastens
those
whom
it
loves
best
being
pleased
by
repeated
trials
to
make
these
pure
spirits
more
pure
so
pen
never
got
the
letter
although
it
was
duly
posted
and
faithfully
discharged
by
the
postman
into
his
in
lamb
court
and
thence
carried
by
the
laundress
to
his
with
the
rest
of
his
lordship
correspondence
into
which
room
have
we
not
seen
a
picture
of
him
entering
from
his
little
bedroom
adjoining
as
flanagan
his
laundress
was
in
the
act
of
drinking
his
gin
those
kind
readers
who
have
watched
arthur
career
hitherto
and
have
made
as
they
naturally
would
do
observations
upon
the
moral
character
and
peculiarities
of
their
acquaintance
have
probably
discovered
by
this
time
what
was
the
prevailing
fault
in
mr
disposition
and
who
was
that
greatest
enemy
artfully
indicated
in
the
with
whom
he
had
to
contend
not
a
few
of
us
my
beloved
public
have
the
very
same
rascal
to
contend
with
a
scoundrel
who
takes
every
opportunity
of
bringing
us
into
mischief
of
plunging
us
into
quarrels
of
leading
us
into
idleness
and
unprofitable
company
and
what
not
in
a
word
pen
greatest
enemy
was
himself
and
as
he
had
been
pampering
and
coaxing
and
indulging
that
individual
all
his
life
the
rogue
grew
insolent
as
all
spoiled
servants
will
be
and
at
the
slightest
attempt
to
coerce
him
or
make
him
do
that
which
was
unpleasant
to
him
became
frantically
rude
and
unruly
a
person
who
is
used
to
making
sacrifices
laura
for
instance
who
had
got
such
a
habit
of
giving
up
her
own
pleasure
for
others
can
do
the
business
quite
easily
but
pen
unaccustomed
as
he
was
to
any
sort
of
suffered
woundily
when
called
on
to
pay
his
share
and
savagely
grumbled
at
being
obliged
to
forgo
anything
he
liked
he
had
resolved
in
his
mighty
mind
then
that
he
would
not
see
fanny
and
he
would
he
tried
to
drive
the
thoughts
of
that
fascinating
little
person
out
of
his
head
by
constant
occupation
by
exercise
by
dissipation
and
society
he
worked
then
too
much
he
walked
and
rode
too
much
he
ate
drank
and
smoked
too
much
nor
could
all
the
cigars
and
the
punch
of
which
he
partook
drive
little
fanny
image
out
of
his
inflamed
brain
and
at
the
end
of
a
week
of
this
discipline
and
our
young
gentleman
was
in
bed
with
a
fever
let
the
reader
who
has
never
had
a
fever
in
chambers
pity
the
wretch
who
is
bound
to
undergo
that
calamity
a
committee
of
marriageable
ladies
or
of
any
christian
persons
interested
in
the
propagation
of
the
domestic
virtues
should
employ
a
cruikshank
or
a
leech
or
some
other
kindly
expositor
of
the
follies
of
the
day
to
make
a
series
of
designs
representing
the
horrors
of
a
bachelor
life
in
chambers
and
leading
the
beholder
to
think
of
better
things
and
a
more
wholesome
condition
what
can
be
more
uncomfortable
than
the
bachelor
lonely
breakfast
with
the
black
kettle
in
the
dreary
fire
in
midsummer
or
worse
still
with
the
fire
gone
out
at
christmas
half
an
hour
after
the
laundress
has
quitted
the
into
this
solitude
the
owner
enters
shivering
and
has
to
commence
his
day
by
hunting
for
coals
and
wood
and
before
he
begins
the
work
of
a
student
has
to
discharge
the
duties
of
a
housemaid
vice
flanagan
who
is
absent
without
leave
or
again
what
can
form
a
finer
subject
for
the
classical
designer
than
the
bachelor
shirt
that
garment
which
he
wants
to
assume
just
at
and
which
he
finds
without
any
buttons
to
fasten
it
then
there
is
the
bachelor
return
to
chambers
after
a
merry
christmas
holiday
spent
in
a
cosy
full
of
pretty
faces
and
kind
welcomes
and
regrets
he
leaves
his
portmanteau
at
the
barber
in
the
court
he
lights
his
dismal
old
candle
at
the
sputtering
little
lamp
on
the
stair
he
enters
the
blank
familiar
room
where
the
only
tokens
to
greet
him
that
show
any
interest
in
his
personal
welfare
are
the
christmas
bills
which
are
lying
in
wait
for
him
amiably
spread
out
on
his
add
to
these
scenes
an
appalling
picture
of
bachelor
illness
and
the
rents
in
the
temple
will
begin
to
fall
from
the
day
of
the
publication
of
the
dismal
diorama
to
be
well
in
chambers
is
melancholy
and
lonely
and
selfish
enough
but
to
be
ill
in
chambers
to
pass
long
nights
of
pain
and
watchfulness
to
long
for
the
morning
and
the
laundress
to
serve
yourself
your
own
medicine
by
your
own
watch
to
have
no
other
companion
for
long
hours
but
your
own
sickening
fancies
and
fevered
thoughts
no
kind
hand
to
give
you
drink
if
you
are
thirsty
or
to
smooth
the
hot
pillow
that
crumples
under
you
this
indeed
is
a
fate
so
dismal
and
tragic
that
we
shall
not
enlarge
upon
its
horrors
and
shall
only
heartily
pity
those
bachelors
in
the
temple
who
brave
it
every
day
this
lot
befell
arthur
pendennis
after
the
various
excesses
which
we
have
mentioned
and
to
which
he
had
subjected
his
unfortunate
brains
one
night
he
went
to
bed
ill
and
the
next
day
awoke
worse
his
only
visitor
that
day
besides
the
laundress
was
the
printer
devil
from
the
pall
mall
gazette
office
whom
the
writer
endeavoured
as
best
he
could
to
satisfy
his
exertions
to
complete
his
work
rendered
his
fever
the
greater
he
could
only
furnish
a
part
of
the
quantity
of
copy
usually
supplied
by
him
and
shandon
being
absent
and
warrington
not
in
london
to
give
a
help
the
political
and
editorial
columns
of
the
gazette
looked
very
blank
indeed
nor
did
the
know
how
to
fill
them
finucane
rushed
up
to
pen
chambers
and
found
that
gentleman
so
exceedingly
unwell
that
the
irishman
set
to
work
to
supply
his
place
if
possible
and
produced
a
series
of
political
and
critical
compositions
such
as
no
doubt
greatly
edified
the
readers
of
the
periodical
in
which
he
and
pen
were
concerned
allusions
to
the
greatness
of
ireland
and
the
genius
and
virtue
of
the
inhabitants
of
that
injured
country
flowed
magnificently
from
finucane
pen
and
shandon
the
chief
of
the
paper
who
was
enjoying
himself
placidly
at
looking
over
the
columns
of
the
journal
which
was
forwarded
to
him
instantly
recognised
the
hand
of
the
great
and
said
laughing
as
he
flung
over
the
paper
to
his
wife
look
here
mary
my
dear
here
is
jack
at
work
indeed
jack
was
a
warm
friend
and
a
gallant
partisan
and
when
he
had
the
pen
in
hand
seldom
let
slip
an
opportunity
of
letting
the
world
know
that
rafferty
was
the
greatest
painter
in
europe
and
wondering
at
the
petty
jealousy
of
the
academy
which
refused
to
make
him
an
of
stating
that
it
was
generally
reported
at
the
west
end
that
rooney
was
appointed
governor
of
barataria
or
of
introducing
into
the
subject
in
hand
whatever
it
might
be
a
compliment
to
the
round
towers
or
the
causeway
and
besides
doing
pen
work
for
him
to
the
best
of
his
ability
his
comrade
offered
to
forgo
his
and
sunday
holiday
and
pass
those
days
of
holiday
and
rest
as
to
arthur
who
however
insisted
that
the
other
should
not
forgo
his
pleasure
and
thankfully
assured
him
that
he
could
bear
best
his
malady
alone
taking
his
supper
at
the
back
kitchen
on
the
friday
night
after
having
achieved
the
work
of
the
paper
finucane
informed
captain
costigan
of
the
illness
of
their
young
friend
in
the
temple
and
remembering
the
fact
two
days
afterwards
the
captain
went
to
lamb
court
and
paid
a
visit
to
the
invalid
on
sunday
afternoon
he
found
flanagan
the
laundress
in
tears
in
the
and
got
a
bad
report
of
the
poor
dear
young
gentleman
within
condition
had
so
much
alarmed
her
that
she
was
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
the
stimulus
of
brandy
to
enable
her
to
support
the
grief
which
his
illness
occasioned
as
she
hung
about
his
bed
and
endeavoured
to
minister
to
him
her
attentions
became
intolerable
to
the
invalid
and
he
begged
her
peevishly
not
to
come
near
him
hence
the
tears
and
redoubled
grief
and
renewed
application
to
the
bottle
which
she
was
accustomed
to
use
as
an
anodyne
the
captain
rated
the
woman
soundly
for
her
intemperance
and
pointed
out
to
her
the
fatal
consequences
which
must
ensue
if
she
persisted
in
her
imprudent
courses
pen
who
was
by
this
time
in
a
very
fevered
state
yet
was
greatly
pleased
to
receive
costigan
visit
he
heard
the
voice
in
his
as
he
lay
in
the
bedroom
within
and
called
the
captain
eagerly
to
him
and
thanked
him
for
coming
and
begged
him
to
take
a
chair
and
talk
to
him
the
captain
felt
the
young
man
pulse
with
great
gravity
his
own
tremulous
and
clammy
hand
growing
steady
for
the
instant
while
his
finger
pressed
arthur
throbbing
vein
the
pulse
was
beating
very
fiercely
pen
face
was
haggard
and
hot
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
gloomy
his
bird
as
the
captain
pronounced
the
word
afterwards
giving
a
description
of
his
condition
had
not
been
shaved
for
nearly
a
week
pen
made
his
visitor
sit
down
and
tossing
and
turning
in
his
comfortless
bed
began
to
try
and
talk
to
the
captain
in
a
lively
manner
about
the
back
kitchen
about
vauxhall
and
when
they
should
go
again
and
about
fanny
how
was
little
fanny
indeed
how
was
she
we
know
how
she
went
home
very
sadly
on
the
previous
sunday
evening
after
she
had
seen
arthur
light
his
lamp
in
his
chambers
whilst
he
was
having
his
interview
with
bows
bows
came
back
to
his
own
rooms
presently
passing
by
the
lodge
door
and
looking
into
bolton
according
to
his
wont
as
he
passed
but
with
a
very
melancholy
face
she
had
another
weary
night
that
night
her
restlessness
wakened
her
little
bedfellows
more
than
once
she
read
more
of
lorraine
father
was
at
home
and
would
suffer
no
light
she
kept
the
book
under
her
pillow
and
felt
for
it
in
the
night
she
had
only
just
got
to
sleep
when
the
children
began
to
stir
with
the
morning
almost
as
early
as
the
birds
though
she
was
very
angry
with
bows
she
went
to
his
room
at
her
accustomed
hour
in
the
day
and
there
the
musician
began
to
talk
to
her
i
saw
pendennis
last
night
fanny
he
said
did
you
i
thought
you
did
fanny
answered
looking
fiercely
at
the
melancholy
old
gentleman
i
been
fond
of
you
ever
since
we
came
to
live
in
this
place
he
continued
you
were
a
child
when
i
came
and
you
used
to
like
me
fanny
until
three
or
four
days
ago
until
you
saw
this
and
now
i
suppose
you
are
going
to
say
ill
of
him
said
fanny
do
bows
that
will
make
me
like
you
indeed
i
shall
do
no
such
thing
bows
answered
i
think
he
is
a
very
good
and
honest
young
indeed
you
know
that
if
you
said
a
word
against
him
i
would
never
speak
a
word
to
you
again
never
cried
miss
fanny
and
clenched
her
little
hand
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
bows
noted
watched
and
followed
the
ardent
little
creature
with
admiration
and
gloomy
sympathy
her
cheeks
flushed
her
frame
trembled
her
eyes
beamed
love
anger
defiance
you
would
like
to
speak
ill
of
him
she
said
but
you
dare
you
know
you
dare
i
knew
him
many
years
since
bows
continued
when
he
was
almost
as
young
as
you
are
and
he
had
a
romantic
attachment
for
our
friend
the
captain
daughter
lady
mirabel
that
is
fanny
laughed
i
suppose
there
was
other
people
too
that
had
romantic
attachments
for
miss
costigan
she
said
i
do
want
to
hear
about
he
wanted
to
marry
her
but
their
ages
were
quite
disproportionate
and
their
rank
in
life
she
would
not
have
him
because
he
had
no
money
she
acted
very
wisely
in
refusing
him
for
the
two
would
have
been
very
unhappy
and
she
was
a
fit
person
to
go
and
live
with
his
family
or
to
make
his
home
comfortable
pendennis
has
his
way
to
make
in
the
world
and
must
marry
a
lady
of
his
own
rank
a
woman
who
loves
a
man
will
not
ruin
his
prospects
cause
him
to
quarrel
with
his
family
and
lead
him
into
poverty
and
misery
for
her
gratification
an
honest
girl
wo
do
that
for
her
own
sake
or
for
the
fanny
emotion
which
but
now
had
been
that
of
defiance
and
anger
here
turned
to
dismay
and
supplication
what
do
i
know
about
marrying
bows
she
said
when
was
there
any
talk
of
it
what
has
there
been
between
this
young
gentleman
and
me
that
to
make
people
speak
so
cruel
it
was
not
my
doing
nor
arthur
pendennis
that
i
met
him
at
vauxhall
it
was
the
captain
took
me
and
ma
there
we
never
thought
of
nothing
wrong
i
sure
he
came
and
rescued
us
and
he
was
so
very
kind
then
he
came
to
call
and
ask
after
us
and
very
very
good
it
was
of
a
such
grand
gentleman
to
be
so
polite
to
humble
folks
like
us
and
yesterday
ma
and
me
just
went
to
walk
in
the
temple
gardens
and
and
here
she
broke
out
with
that
usual
unanswerable
female
argument
of
tears
and
cried
oh
i
wish
i
was
dead
i
wish
i
was
laid
in
my
grave
and
had
never
never
seen
him
he
said
as
much
himself
fanny
bows
said
and
fanny
asked
through
her
sobs
why
why
should
he
wish
he
had
never
seen
her
had
she
ever
done
him
any
harm
oh
she
would
perish
rather
than
do
him
any
harm
whereupon
the
musician
informed
her
of
the
conversation
of
the
day
previous
showed
her
that
pen
could
not
and
must
not
think
of
her
as
a
wife
fitting
for
him
and
that
she
as
she
valued
her
honest
reputation
must
strive
too
to
forget
him
and
fanny
leaving
the
musician
convinced
but
still
of
the
same
mind
and
promising
that
she
would
avoid
the
danger
which
menaced
her
went
back
to
the
porter
lodge
and
told
her
mother
all
she
talked
of
her
love
for
arthur
and
bewailed
in
her
artless
manner
the
inequality
of
their
condition
that
set
barriers
between
them
there
the
of
lyons
fanny
said
oh
ma
how
i
did
love
macready
when
i
saw
him
do
it
and
pauline
for
being
faithful
to
poor
claude
and
always
thinking
of
him
and
he
coming
back
to
her
an
officer
through
all
his
dangers
and
if
everybody
admires
pauline
and
i
sure
everybody
does
for
being
so
true
to
a
poor
man
why
should
a
gentleman
be
ashamed
of
loving
a
poor
girl
not
that
arthur
loves
me
oh
no
no
i
ai
worthy
of
him
only
a
princess
is
worthy
of
such
a
gentleman
as
him
such
a
poet
writing
so
beautifully
and
looking
so
grand
i
am
sure
he
a
nobleman
and
of
ancient
family
and
kep
out
of
his
estate
perhaps
his
uncle
has
it
ah
if
i
might
oh
how
i
serve
him
and
work
for
him
and
slave
for
him
that
i
would
i
would
ask
for
more
than
that
ma
just
to
be
allowed
to
see
him
of
a
morning
and
sometimes
he
say
fanny
or
bless
you
fanny
as
he
said
on
sunday
and
i
work
and
work
and
i
sit
up
all
night
and
read
and
learn
and
make
myself
worthy
of
him
the
captain
says
his
mother
lives
in
the
country
and
is
a
grand
lady
there
oh
how
i
wish
i
might
go
and
be
her
servant
ma
i
can
do
plenty
of
things
and
work
very
neat
and
and
sometimes
come
home
and
i
should
see
him
the
girl
head
fell
on
her
mother
shoulder
as
she
spoke
and
she
gave
way
to
a
plentiful
outpouring
of
girlish
tears
to
which
the
matron
of
course
joined
her
own
you
must
think
no
more
of
him
fanny
she
said
if
he
do
come
to
you
he
a
horrid
wicked
do
call
him
so
mother
fanny
replied
he
the
best
of
men
the
best
and
the
kindest
bows
says
he
thinks
he
is
unhappy
at
leaving
poor
little
fanny
it
was
his
fault
was
it
that
we
met
and
it
his
that
i
must
see
him
again
he
says
i
must
and
i
must
mother
he
forget
me
but
i
shall
never
forget
him
no
i
pray
for
him
and
love
him
always
until
i
die
and
i
shall
die
i
know
i
shall
and
then
my
spirit
will
always
go
and
be
with
you
forget
your
poor
mother
fanny
and
you
break
my
heart
by
goin
on
so
bolton
said
perhaps
you
will
see
him
i
sure
you
see
him
i
sure
he
come
if
ever
i
saw
a
man
in
love
that
man
is
him
when
emily
budd
young
man
first
came
about
her
he
was
sent
away
by
old
budd
a
most
respectable
man
and
violoncello
in
the
orchestra
at
the
wells
and
his
own
family
would
hear
of
it
neither
but
he
came
back
we
all
knew
he
would
emily
always
said
so
and
he
married
her
and
this
one
will
come
back
too
and
you
mark
a
words
and
see
if
he
do
at
this
point
of
the
conversation
bolton
entered
the
lodge
for
his
evening
meal
at
the
father
appearance
the
talk
between
mother
and
daughter
ceased
instantly
bolton
caressed
and
cajoled
the
surly
undertaker
and
said
lor
who
have
thought
to
see
you
away
from
the
club
of
a
saturday
night
fanny
dear
get
your
pa
some
supper
what
will
you
have
the
poor
gurl
got
a
gathering
in
her
eye
or
somethink
in
it
i
was
lookin
at
it
just
now
as
you
came
and
she
squeezed
her
daughter
hand
as
a
signal
of
prudence
and
secrecy
and
fanny
tears
were
dried
up
likewise
and
by
that
wondrous
hypocrisy
and
power
of
disguise
which
women
practise
and
with
which
weapons
of
defence
nature
endows
them
the
traces
of
her
emotion
disappeared
and
she
went
and
took
her
work
and
sate
in
the
corner
so
demure
and
quiet
that
the
careless
male
parent
never
suspected
that
anything
ailed
her
thus
as
if
fate
seemed
determined
to
inflame
and
increase
the
poor
child
malady
and
passion
all
circumstances
and
all
parties
round
about
her
urged
it
on
her
mother
encouraged
and
applauded
it
and
the
very
words
which
bows
used
in
endeavouring
to
repress
her
flame
only
augmented
this
unlucky
fever
pen
was
not
wicked
and
a
seducer
pen
was
in
wishing
to
avoid
her
pen
loved
her
the
good
and
the
great
the
magnificent
youth
with
the
chains
of
gold
and
the
scented
auburn
hair
and
so
he
did
or
so
he
would
have
loved
her
five
years
back
perhaps
before
the
world
had
hardened
the
ardent
and
reckless
boy
before
he
was
ashamed
of
a
foolish
and
imprudent
passion
and
strangled
it
as
poor
women
do
their
illicit
children
not
on
account
of
the
crime
but
of
the
shame
and
from
dread
that
the
finger
of
the
world
should
point
to
them
what
respectable
person
in
the
world
will
not
say
he
was
quite
right
to
avoid
a
marriage
with
an
person
of
low
degree
whose
relations
a
gentleman
could
not
well
acknowledge
and
whose
manners
would
not
become
her
new
station
and
what
philosopher
would
not
tell
him
that
the
best
thing
to
do
with
these
little
passions
if
they
spring
up
is
to
get
rid
of
them
and
let
them
pass
over
and
cure
them
that
no
man
dies
about
a
woman
or
vice
versa
and
that
one
or
the
other
having
found
the
impossibility
of
gratifying
his
or
her
desire
in
the
particular
instance
must
make
the
best
of
matters
forget
each
other
look
out
elsewhere
and
choose
again
and
yet
perhaps
there
may
be
something
said
on
the
other
side
perhaps
bows
was
right
in
admiring
that
passion
of
pen
blind
and
unreasoning
as
it
was
that
made
him
ready
to
stake
his
all
for
his
love
perhaps
if
is
a
laudable
virtue
mere
worldly
is
not
very
much
to
be
praised
in
fine
let
this
be
a
reserved
point
to
be
settled
by
the
individual
moralist
who
chooses
to
debate
it
so
much
is
certain
that
with
the
experience
of
the
world
which
mr
pen
now
had
he
would
have
laughed
at
and
scouted
the
idea
of
marrying
a
penniless
girl
out
of
a
kitchen
and
this
point
being
fixed
in
his
mind
he
was
but
doing
his
duty
as
an
honest
man
in
crushing
any
unlucky
fondness
which
he
might
feel
towards
poor
little
fanny
so
she
waited
and
waited
in
hopes
that
arthur
would
come
she
waited
for
a
whole
week
and
it
was
at
the
end
of
that
time
that
the
poor
little
creature
heard
from
costigan
of
the
illness
under
which
arthur
was
suffering
it
chanced
on
that
very
evening
after
costigan
had
visited
pen
that
arthur
uncle
the
excellent
major
arrived
in
town
from
buxton
where
his
health
had
been
mended
and
sent
his
valet
morgan
to
make
inquiries
for
arthur
and
to
request
that
gentleman
to
breakfast
with
the
major
the
next
morning
the
major
was
merely
passing
through
london
on
his
way
to
the
marquis
of
steyne
house
of
stillbrook
where
he
was
engaged
to
shoot
partridges
morgan
came
back
to
his
master
with
a
very
long
face
he
had
seen
arthur
arthur
was
very
bad
indeed
arthur
was
in
bed
with
a
fever
a
doctor
ought
to
be
sent
to
him
and
morgan
thought
his
case
most
alarming
gracious
goodness
this
was
sad
news
indeed
he
had
hoped
that
arthur
could
come
down
to
stillbrook
he
had
arranged
that
he
should
go
and
procured
an
invitation
for
his
nephew
from
lord
steyne
he
must
go
himself
he
could
throw
lord
steyne
over
the
fever
might
be
catching
it
might
be
measles
he
had
never
himself
had
the
measles
they
were
dangerous
when
contracted
at
his
age
was
anybody
with
arthur
morgan
said
there
was
somebody
of
arthur
the
major
then
asked
had
his
nephew
taken
any
advice
morgan
said
he
had
asked
that
question
and
had
been
told
that
pendennis
had
had
no
doctor
morgan
master
was
sincerely
vexed
at
hearing
of
arthur
calamity
he
would
have
gone
to
him
but
what
good
could
it
do
arthur
that
he
the
major
should
catch
a
fever
his
own
ailments
rendered
it
absolutely
impossible
that
he
should
attend
to
anybody
but
himself
but
the
young
man
must
have
advice
the
best
advice
and
morgan
was
straightway
despatched
with
a
note
from
major
pendennis
to
his
friend
doctor
goodenough
who
by
good
luck
happened
to
be
in
london
and
at
home
and
who
quitted
his
dinner
instantly
and
whose
carriage
was
in
half
an
hour
in
upper
temple
lane
near
pen
chambers
the
major
had
asked
the
physician
to
bring
him
news
of
his
nephew
at
the
club
where
he
himself
was
dining
and
in
the
course
of
the
night
the
doctor
made
his
appearance
the
affair
was
very
serious
the
patient
was
in
a
high
fever
he
had
had
pen
bled
instantly
and
would
see
him
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
the
major
went
disconsolate
to
bed
with
this
unfortunate
news
when
goodenough
came
to
see
him
according
to
his
promise
the
next
day
the
doctor
had
to
listen
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
an
account
of
the
major
own
maladies
before
the
latter
had
leisure
to
hear
about
arthur
he
had
had
a
very
bad
night
his
his
nurse
said
at
one
hour
he
had
been
delirious
it
might
end
badly
his
mother
had
better
be
sent
for
immediately
the
major
wrote
the
letter
to
pendennis
with
the
greatest
alacrity
and
at
the
same
time
with
the
most
polite
precautions
as
for
going
himself
to
the
lad
in
his
state
it
was
impossible
could
i
be
of
any
use
to
him
my
dear
doctor
he
asked
the
doctor
with
a
peculiar
laugh
said
no
he
did
think
the
major
could
be
of
any
use
that
his
own
precious
health
required
the
most
delicate
treatment
and
that
he
had
best
go
into
the
country
and
stay
that
he
himself
would
take
care
to
see
the
patient
twice
a
day
and
do
all
in
his
power
for
him
the
major
declared
upon
his
honour
that
if
he
could
be
of
any
use
he
would
rush
to
pen
chambers
as
it
was
morgan
should
go
and
see
that
everything
was
right
the
doctor
must
write
to
him
by
every
post
to
stillbrook
it
was
but
forty
miles
distant
from
london
and
if
anything
happened
he
would
come
up
at
any
sacrifice
major
pendennis
transacted
his
benevolence
by
deputy
and
by
post
what
else
could
he
do
as
he
said
gad
you
know
in
these
cases
it
best
not
disturbing
a
fellow
if
a
poor
fellow
goes
to
the
bad
why
gad
you
know
he
disposed
of
but
in
order
to
get
well
and
in
this
my
dear
doctor
i
sure
that
you
will
agree
with
me
the
best
way
is
to
keep
him
quiet
perfectly
thus
it
was
the
old
gentleman
tried
to
satisfy
his
conscience
and
he
went
his
way
that
day
to
stillbrook
by
railway
for
railways
have
sprung
up
in
the
course
of
this
narrative
though
they
have
not
quite
penetrated
into
pen
country
yet
and
made
his
appearance
in
his
usual
trim
order
and
curly
wig
at
the
of
the
marquis
of
steyne
but
we
must
do
the
major
the
justice
to
say
that
he
was
very
unhappy
and
gloomy
in
demeanour
wagg
and
wenham
rallied
him
about
his
low
spirits
asked
whether
he
was
crossed
in
love
and
otherwise
diverted
themselves
at
his
expense
he
lost
his
money
at
whist
after
dinner
and
actually
trumped
his
partner
highest
spade
and
the
thoughts
of
the
suffering
boy
of
whom
he
was
proud
and
whom
he
loved
after
his
manner
kept
the
old
fellow
awake
half
through
the
night
and
made
him
feverish
and
uneasy
on
the
morrow
he
received
a
note
in
a
handwriting
which
he
did
not
know
it
was
that
of
bows
indeed
saying
that
arthur
pendennis
had
had
a
tolerable
night
and
that
as
goodenough
had
stated
that
the
major
desired
to
be
informed
of
his
nephew
health
he
had
sent
him
the
news
per
rail
the
next
day
he
was
going
out
shooting
about
noon
with
some
of
the
gentlemen
staying
at
lord
steyne
house
and
the
company
waiting
for
the
carriages
were
assembled
on
the
terrace
in
front
of
the
house
when
a
fly
drove
up
from
the
neighbouring
station
and
a
rather
shabby
old
gentleman
jumped
out
and
asked
for
major
pendennis
it
was
bows
he
took
the
major
aside
and
spoke
to
him
most
of
the
gentlemen
round
about
saw
that
something
serious
had
happened
from
the
alarmed
look
of
the
major
face
wagg
said
it
a
bailiff
come
down
to
nab
the
major
but
nobody
laughed
at
the
pleasantry
hullo
what
the
matter
pendennis
cried
lord
steyne
with
his
strident
voice
anything
wrong
it
it
my
boy
that
dead
said
the
major
and
burst
into
a
sob
the
old
man
was
quite
overcome
not
dead
my
lord
but
very
ill
when
i
left
london
bows
said
in
a
low
voice
a
britzka
came
up
at
this
moment
as
the
three
men
were
speaking
the
peer
looked
at
his
watch
you
twenty
minutes
to
catch
the
jump
in
pendennis
and
drive
like
h
sir
do
you
hear
the
carriage
drove
off
swiftly
with
pendennis
and
his
companions
and
let
us
trust
that
the
oath
will
be
pardoned
to
the
marquis
of
steyne
the
major
drove
rapidly
from
the
station
to
the
temple
and
found
a
travelling
carriage
already
before
him
and
blocking
up
the
narrow
temple
lane
two
ladies
got
out
of
it
and
were
asking
their
way
of
the
porters
the
major
looked
by
chance
at
the
panel
of
the
carriage
and
saw
the
crest
of
the
eagle
looking
at
the
sun
and
the
motto
nec
tenui
penna
painted
beneath
it
was
his
brother
old
carriage
built
many
many
years
ago
it
was
helen
and
laura
that
were
asking
their
way
to
pen
room
he
ran
up
to
them
hastily
clasped
his
sister
arm
and
kissed
her
hand
and
the
three
entered
into
lamb
court
and
mounted
the
long
gloomy
stair
they
knocked
very
gently
at
the
door
on
which
arthur
name
was
written
and
it
was
opened
by
fanny
bolton
chapter
liii
a
critical
chapter
as
fanny
saw
the
two
ladies
and
the
anxious
countenance
of
the
eider
who
regarded
her
with
a
look
of
inscrutable
alarm
and
terror
the
poor
girl
at
once
knew
that
pen
mother
was
before
her
there
was
a
resemblance
between
the
widow
haggard
eyes
and
arthur
as
he
tossed
in
his
bed
in
fever
fanny
looked
wistfully
at
pendennis
and
at
laura
afterwards
there
was
no
more
expression
in
the
latter
face
than
if
it
had
been
a
mass
of
stone
and
gloom
dwelt
on
the
figures
of
both
the
neither
showed
any
the
faintest
gleam
of
mercy
or
sympathy
for
fanny
she
looked
desperately
from
them
to
the
major
behind
them
old
pendennis
dropped
his
eyelids
looking
up
ever
so
stealthily
from
under
them
at
arthur
poor
little
nurse
i
i
wrote
to
you
yesterday
if
you
please
fanny
said
trembling
in
every
limb
as
she
spoke
and
as
pale
as
laura
whose
sad
menacing
face
looked
over
pendennis
shoulder
did
you
madam
pendennis
said
i
suppose
i
may
now
relieve
you
from
nursing
my
son
i
am
his
mother
you
yes
i
this
is
the
way
to
his
oh
wait
a
minute
cried
out
fanny
i
must
prepare
you
for
his
the
widow
whose
face
had
been
hopelessly
cruel
and
ruthless
here
started
back
with
a
gasp
and
a
little
cry
which
she
speedily
stifled
he
been
so
since
yesterday
fanny
said
trembling
very
much
and
with
chattering
teeth
a
horrid
shriek
of
laughter
came
out
of
pen
room
whereof
the
door
was
open
and
after
several
shouts
the
poor
wretch
began
to
sing
a
college
and
then
to
hurray
and
to
shout
as
if
he
was
in
the
midst
of
a
and
to
thump
with
his
fist
against
the
wainscot
he
was
quite
delirious
he
does
not
know
me
fanny
said
indeed
perhaps
he
will
know
his
mother
let
me
pass
if
you
please
and
go
in
to
and
the
widow
hastily
pushed
by
little
fanny
and
through
the
dark
passage
which
led
into
pen
laura
sailed
by
fanny
too
without
a
word
and
major
pendennis
followed
them
fanny
sat
down
on
a
bench
in
the
passage
and
cried
and
prayed
as
well
as
she
could
she
would
have
died
for
him
and
they
hated
her
they
had
not
a
word
of
thanks
or
kindness
for
her
the
fine
ladies
she
sate
there
in
the
passage
she
did
not
know
how
long
they
never
came
out
to
speak
to
her
she
sate
there
until
doctor
goodenough
came
to
pay
his
second
visit
that
day
he
found
the
poor
little
thing
at
the
door
what
nurse
how
your
patient
asked
the
doctor
has
he
had
any
rest
go
and
ask
them
they
inside
fanny
answered
who
his
mother
fanny
nodded
her
head
and
did
speak
you
must
go
to
bed
yourself
my
poor
little
maid
said
the
doctor
you
will
be
ill
too
if
you
oh
may
i
come
and
see
him
may
i
come
and
see
him
i
i
love
him
so
the
little
girl
said
and
as
she
spoke
she
fell
down
on
her
knees
and
clasped
hold
of
the
doctor
hand
in
such
an
agony
that
to
see
her
melted
the
kind
physician
heart
and
caused
a
mist
to
come
over
his
spectacles
pooh
pooh
nonsense
nurse
has
he
taken
his
draught
has
he
had
any
rest
of
course
you
must
come
and
see
him
so
must
they
let
me
sit
here
wo
they
sir
i
never
make
no
noise
i
only
ask
to
stop
here
fanny
said
on
which
the
doctor
called
her
a
stupid
little
thing
put
her
down
upon
the
bench
where
pen
devil
used
to
sit
so
many
hours
tapped
her
pale
cheek
with
his
finger
and
bustled
into
the
farther
room
pendennis
was
ensconced
pale
and
solemn
in
a
great
chair
by
bedside
her
watch
was
on
the
by
pen
medicines
her
bonnet
and
cloaks
were
laid
in
the
window
she
had
her
bible
in
her
lap
without
which
she
never
travelled
her
first
movement
after
seeing
her
son
had
been
to
take
fanny
shawl
and
bonnet
which
were
on
his
drawers
and
bring
them
out
and
drop
them
down
upon
his
she
had
closed
the
door
upon
major
pendennis
and
laura
too
and
taken
possession
of
her
son
she
had
had
a
great
doubt
and
terror
lest
arthur
should
not
know
her
but
that
pang
was
spared
to
her
in
part
at
least
pen
knew
his
mother
quite
well
and
familiarly
smiled
and
nodded
at
her
when
she
came
in
he
instantly
fancied
that
they
were
at
home
at
fairoaks
and
began
to
talk
and
chatter
and
laugh
in
a
rambling
wild
way
laura
could
hear
him
outside
his
laughter
shot
shafts
of
poison
into
her
heart
it
was
true
then
he
had
been
guilty
and
with
that
creature
an
intrigue
with
a
and
she
had
loved
him
and
he
was
dying
most
likely
raving
and
unrepentant
the
major
now
and
then
hummed
out
a
word
of
remark
or
consolation
which
laura
scarce
heard
a
dismal
sitting
it
was
for
all
parties
and
when
goodenough
appeared
he
came
like
an
angel
into
the
room
it
is
not
only
for
the
sick
man
it
is
for
the
sick
man
friends
that
the
doctor
comes
his
presence
is
often
as
good
for
them
as
for
the
patient
and
they
long
for
him
yet
more
eagerly
how
we
have
all
watched
after
him
what
an
emotion
the
thrill
of
his
in
the
street
and
at
length
at
the
door
has
made
us
feel
how
we
hang
upon
his
words
and
what
a
comfort
we
get
from
a
smile
or
two
if
he
can
vouchsafe
that
sunshine
to
lighten
our
darkness
who
has
seen
the
mother
prying
into
his
face
to
know
if
there
is
hope
for
the
sick
infant
that
can
not
speak
and
that
lies
yonder
its
little
frame
battling
with
fever
ah
how
she
looks
into
his
eyes
what
thanks
if
there
is
light
there
what
grief
and
pain
if
he
casts
them
down
and
dares
not
say
hope
or
it
is
the
who
is
stricken
the
terrified
wife
looks
on
while
the
physician
feels
his
patient
wrist
smothering
her
agonies
as
the
children
have
been
called
upon
to
stay
their
plays
and
their
talk
over
the
patient
in
the
fever
the
wife
expectant
the
children
unconscious
the
doctor
stands
as
if
he
were
fate
the
dispenser
of
life
and
death
he
must
let
the
patient
off
this
time
the
woman
prays
so
for
his
respite
one
can
fancy
how
awful
the
responsibility
must
be
to
a
conscientious
man
how
cruel
the
feeling
that
he
has
given
the
wrong
remedy
or
that
it
might
have
been
possible
to
do
better
how
harassing
the
sympathy
with
survivors
if
the
case
is
unfortunate
how
immense
the
delight
of
victory
having
passed
through
a
hasty
ceremony
of
introduction
to
the
of
whose
arrival
he
had
been
made
aware
by
the
heartbroken
little
nurse
in
waiting
without
the
doctor
proceeded
to
examine
the
patient
about
whose
condition
of
high
fever
there
could
be
no
mistake
and
on
whom
he
thought
it
necessary
to
exercise
the
strongest
antiphlogistic
remedies
in
his
power
he
consoled
the
unfortunate
mother
as
best
he
might
and
giving
her
the
most
comfortable
assurances
on
which
he
could
venture
that
there
was
no
reason
to
despair
yet
that
everything
might
still
be
hoped
from
his
youth
the
strength
of
his
constitution
and
so
forth
and
having
done
his
utmost
to
allay
the
horrors
of
the
alarmed
matron
he
took
the
elder
pendennis
aside
into
the
vacant
room
warrington
bedroom
for
the
purpose
of
holding
a
little
consultation
the
case
was
very
critical
the
fever
if
not
stopped
might
and
would
carry
off
the
young
fellow
he
must
be
bled
forthwith
the
mother
must
be
informed
of
this
necessity
why
was
that
other
young
lady
brought
with
her
she
was
out
of
place
in
a
and
there
was
another
woman
still
be
hanged
to
it
the
major
said
the
the
little
person
who
opened
the
his
had
brought
the
poor
little
devil
bonnet
and
shawl
out
flung
them
upon
the
did
goodenough
know
anything
about
the
the
little
person
i
just
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
as
we
passed
in
the
major
said
and
begad
she
was
uncommonly
the
doctor
looked
queer
the
doctor
smiled
in
the
very
gravest
moments
with
life
and
death
pending
such
strange
contrasts
and
occasions
of
humour
will
arise
and
such
smiles
will
pass
to
satirise
the
gloom
as
it
were
and
to
make
it
more
gloomy
i
have
it
at
last
he
said
the
study
and
he
wrote
a
couple
of
notes
hastily
at
the
table
there
and
sealed
one
of
them
then
taking
up
poor
fanny
shawl
and
bonnet
and
the
notes
he
went
out
in
the
passage
to
that
poor
little
messenger
and
said
quick
nurse
you
must
carry
this
to
the
surgeon
and
bid
him
come
instantly
and
then
go
to
my
house
and
ask
for
my
servant
harbottle
and
tell
him
to
get
this
prescription
prepared
and
wait
until
i
until
it
is
ready
it
may
take
a
little
in
so
poor
fanny
trudged
away
with
her
two
notes
and
found
the
apothecary
who
lived
in
the
strand
hard
by
and
who
came
straightway
his
lancet
in
his
pocket
to
operate
on
his
patient
and
then
fanny
made
for
the
doctor
house
in
hanover
square
the
doctor
was
at
home
again
before
the
prescription
was
made
up
which
took
harbottle
his
servant
such
a
long
time
in
compounding
and
during
the
remainder
of
arthur
illness
poor
fanny
never
made
her
appearance
in
the
quality
of
nurse
at
his
chambers
any
more
but
for
that
day
and
the
next
a
little
figure
might
be
seen
lurking
about
pen
staircase
a
sad
sad
little
face
looked
at
and
interrogated
the
apothecary
and
the
apothecary
boy
and
the
laundress
and
the
kind
physician
himself
as
they
passed
out
of
the
chambers
of
the
sick
man
and
on
the
third
day
the
kind
doctor
chariot
stopped
at
inn
and
the
good
and
honest
and
benevolent
man
went
into
the
lodge
and
tended
a
little
patient
whom
he
had
there
for
the
best
remedy
he
found
was
on
the
day
when
he
was
enabled
to
tell
fanny
bolton
that
the
crisis
was
over
and
that
there
was
at
length
every
hope
for
arthur
pendennis
costigan
esquire
late
of
her
majesty
service
saw
the
carriage
and
criticised
its
horses
and
appointments
green
liveries
bedad
the
general
said
and
as
foin
a
pair
of
bee
horses
as
ever
a
gentleman
need
sit
behoind
let
alone
a
docthor
there
no
ind
to
the
proide
and
of
them
docthors
nowadays
not
but
that
is
a
good
one
and
a
scoientific
cyarkter
and
a
roight
good
fellow
bedad
and
he
brought
the
poor
little
girl
well
troo
her
faver
bows
me
boy
and
so
pleased
was
costigan
with
the
doctor
behaviour
and
skill
that
whenever
he
met
carriage
in
future
he
made
a
point
of
saluting
it
and
the
physician
inside
in
as
courteous
and
magnificent
a
manner
as
if
goodenough
had
been
the
lord
liftenant
himself
and
captain
costigan
had
been
in
his
glory
in
phaynix
park
the
widow
gratitude
to
the
physician
knew
no
bounds
or
scarcely
any
bounds
at
least
the
kind
gentleman
laughed
at
the
idea
of
taking
a
fee
from
a
literary
man
or
the
widow
of
a
brother
practitioner
and
she
determined
when
she
got
to
fairoaks
that
she
would
send
goodenough
the
vase
the
jewel
of
the
house
and
the
glory
of
the
late
john
pendennis
preserved
in
green
baize
and
presented
to
him
at
bath
by
the
lady
elizabeth
firebrace
on
the
recovery
of
her
son
the
late
sir
anthony
firebrace
from
the
scarlet
fever
hippocrates
hygeia
king
bladud
and
a
wreath
of
serpents
surmount
the
cup
to
this
day
which
was
executed
in
their
finest
manner
by
abednego
of
milsom
street
and
the
inscription
was
by
birch
tutor
to
the
young
baronet
this
priceless
gem
of
art
the
widow
determined
to
devote
to
goodenough
the
preserver
of
her
son
and
there
was
scarcely
any
other
favour
which
her
gratitude
would
not
have
conferred
upon
him
except
one
which
he
desired
most
and
which
was
that
she
should
think
a
little
charitably
and
kindly
of
poor
fanny
of
whose
artless
sad
story
he
had
got
something
during
his
interviews
with
her
and
of
whom
he
was
induced
to
think
very
kindly
not
being
disposed
indeed
to
give
much
credit
to
pen
for
his
conduct
in
the
affair
or
not
knowing
what
that
conduct
had
been
he
knew
enough
however
to
be
aware
that
the
poor
infatuated
little
girl
was
without
stain
as
yet
that
while
she
had
been
in
room
it
was
to
see
the
last
of
him
as
she
thought
and
that
arthur
was
scarcely
aware
of
her
presence
and
that
she
suffered
under
the
deepest
and
most
pitiful
grief
at
the
idea
of
losing
him
dead
or
living
but
on
the
one
or
two
occasions
when
goodenough
alluded
to
fanny
the
widow
countenance
always
soft
and
gentle
assumed
an
expression
so
cruel
and
inexorable
that
the
doctor
saw
it
was
in
vain
to
ask
her
for
justice
or
pity
and
he
broke
off
all
entreaties
and
ceased
making
any
further
allusions
regarding
his
little
client
there
is
a
complaint
which
neither
poppy
nor
mandragora
nor
all
the
drowsy
syrups
of
the
east
could
allay
in
the
men
in
his
time
as
we
are
informed
by
a
popular
poet
of
the
days
of
elizabeth
and
which
when
exhibited
in
women
no
medical
discoveries
or
practice
subsequent
neither
homoeopathy
nor
hydropathy
nor
mesmerism
nor
simpson
nor
locock
can
cure
and
that
is
we
wo
call
it
jealousy
but
rather
gently
denominate
rivalry
and
emulation
in
ladies
some
of
those
mischievous
and
prosaic
people
who
carp
and
calculate
at
every
detail
of
the
romancer
and
want
to
know
for
instance
how
when
the
characters
in
the
are
at
a
dead
lock
with
their
daggers
at
each
other
throats
they
are
to
be
got
out
of
that
murderous
complication
of
circumstances
may
be
induced
to
ask
how
it
was
possible
in
a
set
of
chambers
in
the
temple
consisting
of
three
rooms
two
cupboards
a
passage
and
a
arthur
a
sick
gentleman
helen
his
mother
laura
her
adopted
daughter
martha
their
country
attendant
wheezer
a
nurse
from
bartholomew
hospital
flanagan
an
irish
laundress
major
pendennis
a
retired
military
officer
morgan
his
valet
pidgeon
arthur
pendennis
boy
and
others
could
be
accommodated
the
answer
is
given
at
once
that
almost
everybody
in
the
temple
was
out
of
town
and
that
there
was
scarcely
a
single
occupant
of
pen
house
in
lamb
court
except
those
who
were
occupied
round
the
of
the
sick
gentleman
about
whose
fever
we
have
not
given
a
lengthy
account
neither
enlarge
we
very
much
upon
the
more
cheerful
theme
of
his
recovery
everybody
we
have
said
was
out
of
town
and
of
course
such
a
fashionable
man
as
young
sibwright
who
occupied
chambers
on
the
second
floor
in
pen
staircase
could
not
be
supposed
to
remain
in
london
flanagan
pendennis
laundress
was
acquainted
with
rouncy
who
did
for
sibwright
and
that
gentleman
bedroom
was
got
ready
for
miss
bell
or
pendennis
when
the
latter
should
be
inclined
to
leave
her
son
to
try
and
seek
for
a
little
rest
for
herself
if
that
young
buck
and
flower
of
baker
street
percy
sibwright
could
have
known
who
was
the
occupant
of
his
bedroom
how
proud
he
would
have
been
of
that
apartment
what
poems
he
would
have
written
about
laura
several
of
his
things
have
appeared
in
the
annuals
and
in
manuscript
in
the
nobility
albums
he
was
a
camford
man
and
very
nearly
got
the
english
prize
poem
it
was
said
sibwright
however
was
absent
and
his
bed
given
up
to
miss
bell
it
was
the
prettiest
little
brass
bed
in
the
world
with
chintz
curtains
lined
with
pink
he
had
a
in
his
bedroom
window
and
the
mere
sight
of
his
little
exhibition
of
shiny
boots
arranged
in
trim
rows
over
his
wardrobe
was
a
gratification
to
the
beholder
he
had
a
museum
of
scent
pomatum
and
pots
quite
curious
to
examine
too
and
a
choice
selection
of
portraits
of
females
almost
always
in
sadness
and
generally
in
disguise
or
deshabille
glittered
round
the
neat
walls
of
his
elegant
little
bower
of
repose
medora
with
dishevelled
hair
was
consoling
herself
over
her

sadly
ogling
out
of
the

of
her
convent

in
which
poor

she
was
moulting
away
dorothea
of

was
washing
her
eternal
feet
in

it
was
such
an
elegant
gallery
as
became
a
gallant
lover
of
the
sex
and
in
sibwright
while
there
was
quite
an
infantine
law
library
clad
in
skins
of
fresh
calf
there
was
a
tolerably
large
collection
of
classical
books
which
he
could
not
read

of
english
and
french
works
of
poetry
and
fiction
which
he
read
a
great
deal
too
much
his

of

still
decorated

scarce
anything

of

was
a
sporting
man
married
to
a
rich
widow
bangham
had
no
practice
did
not
come
to
chambers
thrice
in
a
term
went
a
circuit
for
those
mysterious
reasons
which
make
men
go
circuit
and
his
room
served
as
a
great
convenience
to
sibwright
when
that
young
gentleman
gave
his
little
dinners
it
must
be
confessed
that
these
two
gentlemen
have
nothing
to
do
with
our
history
will
never
appear
in
it
again
probably
but
we
can
not
help
glancing
through
their
doors
as
they
happen
to
be
open
to
us
and
as
we
pass
to
pen
rooms
as
in
the
pursuit
of
our
own
business
in
life
through
the
strand
at
the
club
nay
at
church
itself
we
can
not
help
peeping
at
the
shops
on
the
way
or
at
our
neighbour
dinner
or
at
the
faces
under
the
bonnets
in
the
next
pew
very
many
years
after
the
circumstances
about
which
we
are
at
present
occupied
laura
with
a
blush
and
a
laugh
showing
much
humour
owned
to
having
read
a
french
novel
once
much
in
vogue
and
when
her
husband
asked
her
wondering
where
on
earth
she
could
have
got
such
a
volume
she
owned
that
it
was
in
the
temple
when
she
lived
in
percy
sibwright
chambers
and
also
i
never
confessed
she
said
on
that
same
occasion
what
i
must
now
own
to
that
i
opened
the
japanned
box
and
took
out
that
wig
inside
it
and
put
it
on
and
looked
at
myself
in
the
glass
in
suppose
percy
sibwright
had
come
in
at
such
a
moment
as
that
what
would
he
have
said
the
enraptured
rogue
what
would
have
been
all
the
pictures
of
disguised
beauties
in
his
room
compared
to
that
living
one
ah
we
are
speaking
of
old
times
when
sibwright
was
a
bachelor
and
before
he
got
a
county
court
when
people
were
young
when
most
people
were
young
other
people
are
young
now
but
we
no
more
when
miss
laura
played
this
prank
with
the
wig
you
ca
suppose
that
pen
could
have
been
very
ill
upstairs
otherwise
though
she
had
grown
to
care
for
him
ever
so
little
common
sense
of
feeling
and
decorum
would
have
prevented
her
from
performing
any
tricks
or
trying
any
disguises
but
all
sorts
of
events
had
occurred
in
the
course
of
the
last
few
days
which
had
contributed
to
increase
or
account
for
her
gaiety
and
a
little
colony
of
the
reader
old
friends
and
acquaintances
was
by
this
time
established
in
lamb
court
temple
and
round
pen
there
first
martha
pendennis
servant
had
arrived
from
fairoaks
being
summoned
thence
by
the
major
who
justly
thought
her
presence
would
be
comfortable
and
useful
to
her
mistress
and
her
young
master
for
neither
of
whom
the
constant
neighbourhood
of
flanagan
who
during
pen
illness
required
more
spirituous
consolation
than
ever
to
support
her
could
be
pleasant
martha
then
made
her
appearance
in
due
season
to
wait
upon
pendennis
nor
did
that
lady
go
once
to
bed
until
the
faithful
servant
had
reached
her
when
with
a
heart
full
of
maternal
thankfulness
she
went
and
lay
down
upon
warrington
straw
mattress
and
among
his
mathematical
books
as
has
been
already
described
it
is
true
that
ere
that
day
a
great
and
delightful
alteration
in
condition
had
taken
place
the
fever
subjugated
by
blisters
potions
and
lancet
had
left
the
young
man
or
only
returned
at
intervals
of
feeble
intermittence
his
wandering
senses
had
settled
in
his
weakened
brain
he
had
had
time
to
kiss
and
bless
his
mother
for
coming
to
him
and
calling
for
laura
and
his
uncle
who
were
both
affected
according
to
their
different
natures
by
his
wan
appearance
his
lean
shrunken
hands
his
hollow
eyes
and
voice
his
thin
bearded
face
to
press
their
hands
and
thank
them
affectionately
and
after
this
greeting
and
after
they
had
been
turned
out
of
the
room
by
his
affectionate
nurse
he
had
sunk
into
a
fine
sleep
which
had
lasted
for
about
sixteen
hours
at
the
end
of
which
period
he
awoke
calling
out
that
he
was
very
hungry
if
it
is
hard
to
be
ill
and
to
loathe
food
oh
how
pleasant
to
be
getting
well
and
to
be
feeling
hungry
how
hungry
alas
the
joys
of
convalescence
become
feebler
with
increasing
years
as
other
joys
do
and
then
and
then
comes
that
illness
when
one
does
not
convalesce
at
all
on
the
day
of
this
happy
event
too
came
another
arrival
in
lamb
court
this
was
introduced
into
the
by
large
puffs
of
tobacco
smoke
the
puffs
of
were
followed
by
an
individual
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
a
under
his
arm
this
was
warrington
who
had
run
back
from
norfolk
when
bows
thoughtfully
wrote
to
inform
him
of
his
friend
calamity
but
he
had
been
from
home
when
letter
had
reached
his
brother
house
the
eastern
counties
did
not
then
boast
of
a
railway
for
we
beg
the
reader
to
understand
that
we
only
commit
anachronisms
when
we
choose
and
when
by
a
daring
violation
of
those
natural
laws
some
great
ethical
truth
is
to
be
advanced
in
fine
warrington
only
appeared
with
the
rest
of
the
good
luck
upon
the
lucky
day
after
pen
convalescence
may
have
been
said
to
have
begun
his
surprise
was
after
all
not
very
great
when
he
found
the
chambers
of
his
sick
friend
occupied
and
his
old
acquaintance
the
major
seated
demurely
in
an
warrington
had
let
himself
into
the
rooms
with
his
own
passkey
listening
or
pretending
to
listen
to
a
young
lady
who
was
reading
to
him
a
play
of
shakspeare
in
a
low
sweet
voice
the
lady
stopped
and
started
and
laid
down
her
book
at
the
apparition
of
the
tall
traveller
with
the
cigar
and
the
he
blushed
he
flung
the
cigar
into
the
passage
he
took
off
his
hat
and
dropped
that
too
and
going
up
to
the
major
seized
that
old
gentleman
hand
and
asked
questions
about
arthur
the
major
answered
in
a
tremulous
though
cheery
voice
it
was
curious
how
emotion
seemed
to
olden
him
and
returning
warrington
pressure
with
a
shaking
hand
told
him
the
news
of
arthur
happy
crisis
of
his
mother
arrival
with
her
young
charge
with
miss
you
need
not
tell
me
her
name
warrington
said
with
great
animation
for
he
was
affected
and
elated
with
the
thought
of
his
friend
recovery
you
need
not
tell
me
your
name
i
knew
at
once
it
was
and
he
held
out
his
hand
and
took
hers
immense
kindness
and
tenderness
gleamed
from
under
his
rough
eyebrows
and
shook
his
voice
as
he
gazed
at
her
and
spoke
to
her
and
this
is
laura
his
looks
seemed
to
say
and
this
is
warrington
the
generous
girl
heart
beat
back
arthur
hero
the
brave
and
the
kind
he
has
come
hundreds
of
miles
to
succour
him
when
he
heard
of
his
friend
misfortune
thank
you
warrington
was
all
that
laura
said
however
and
as
she
returned
the
pressure
of
his
kind
hand
she
blushed
so
that
she
was
glad
the
lamp
was
behind
her
to
conceal
her
flushing
face
as
these
two
were
standing
in
this
attitude
the
door
of
bedchamber
was
opened
stealthily
as
his
mother
was
wont
to
open
it
and
warrington
saw
another
lady
who
first
looked
at
him
and
then
turning
round
towards
the
bed
said
hsh
and
put
up
her
hand
it
was
to
pen
helen
was
turning
and
giving
caution
he
called
out
with
a
feeble
tremulous
but
cheery
voice
come
in
stunner
come
in
warrington
i
knew
it
was
you
by
the
by
the
smoke
old
boy
he
said
as
holding
his
worn
hand
out
and
with
tears
at
once
of
weakness
and
pleasure
in
his
eyes
he
greeted
his
friend
i
i
beg
pardon
for
smoking
warrington
said
who
now
almost
for
the
first
time
blushed
for
his
wicked
propensity
helen
only
said
god
bless
you
she
was
so
happy
she
would
have
liked
to
kiss
george
then
and
after
the
friends
had
had
a
brief
very
brief
interview
the
delighted
and
inexorable
mother
giving
her
hand
to
warrington
sent
him
out
of
the
room
too
back
to
laura
and
the
major
who
had
not
resumed
their
play
of
cymbeline
where
they
had
left
it
off
at
the
arrival
of
the
rightful
owner
of
pen
chambers
chapter
liv
convalescence
our
duty
now
is
to
record
a
fact
concerning
pendennis
which
however
shameful
and
disgraceful
when
told
regarding
the
chief
personage
and
godfather
of
a
novel
must
nevertheless
be
made
known
to
the
public
who
reads
his
veritable
memoirs
having
gone
to
bed
ill
with
fever
and
suffering
to
a
certain
degree
under
the
passion
of
love
after
he
had
gone
through
his
physical
malady
and
had
been
bled
and
had
been
blistered
and
had
had
his
head
shaved
and
had
been
treated
and
medicamented
as
the
doctor
ordained
it
is
a
fact
that
when
he
rallied
up
from
his
bodily
ailment
his
mental
malady
had
likewise
quitted
him
and
he
was
no
more
in
love
with
fanny
bolton
than
you
or
i
who
are
much
too
wise
or
too
moral
to
allow
our
hearts
to
go
gadding
after
porters
daughters
he
laughed
at
himself
as
he
lay
on
his
pillow
thinking
of
this
second
cure
which
had
been
effected
upon
him
he
did
not
care
the
least
about
fanny
now
he
wondered
how
he
ever
should
have
cared
and
according
to
his
custom
made
an
autopsy
of
that
dead
passion
and
anatomised
his
own
defunct
sensation
for
his
poor
little
nurse
what
could
have
made
him
so
hot
and
eager
about
her
but
a
few
weeks
back
not
her
wit
not
her
breeding
not
her
beauty
there
were
hundreds
of
women
than
she
it
was
out
of
himself
that
the
passion
had
gone
it
did
not
reside
in
her
she
was
the
same
but
the
eyes
which
saw
were
changed
and
alas
that
it
should
be
so
were
not
particularly
eager
to
see
her
any
more
he
felt
very
well
disposed
towards
the
little
thing
and
so
forth
but
as
for
violent
personal
regard
such
as
he
had
but
a
few
weeks
ago
it
had
fled
under
the
influence
of
the
pill
and
lancet
which
had
destroyed
the
fever
in
his
frame
and
an
immense
source
of
comfort
and
gratitude
it
was
to
pendennis
though
there
was
something
selfish
in
that
feeling
as
in
most
others
of
our
young
man
that
he
had
been
enabled
to
resist
temptation
at
the
time
when
the
danger
was
greatest
and
had
no
particular
cause
of
as
he
remembered
his
conduct
towards
the
young
girl
as
from
a
precipice
down
which
he
might
have
fallen
so
from
the
fever
from
which
he
had
recovered
he
reviewed
the
fanny
bolton
snare
now
that
he
had
escaped
out
of
it
but
not
sure
that
he
was
not
ashamed
of
the
very
satisfaction
which
he
experienced
it
is
pleasant
perhaps
but
it
is
humiliating
to
own
that
you
love
no
more
meanwhile
the
kind
smiles
and
tender
watchfulness
of
the
mother
at
his
bedside
filled
the
young
man
with
peace
and
security
to
see
that
health
was
returning
was
all
the
unwearied
nurse
demanded
to
execute
any
caprice
or
order
of
her
patient
her
chiefest
joy
and
reward
he
felt
himself
environed
by
her
love
and
thought
himself
almost
as
grateful
for
it
as
he
had
been
when
weak
and
helpless
in
childhood
some
misty
notions
regarding
the
first
part
of
his
illness
and
that
fanny
had
nursed
him
pen
may
have
had
but
they
were
so
dim
that
he
could
not
realise
them
with
accuracy
or
distinguish
them
from
what
he
knew
to
be
delusions
which
had
occurred
and
were
remembered
during
the
delirium
of
his
fever
so
as
he
had
not
thought
proper
on
former
occasions
to
make
any
allusions
about
fanny
bolton
to
his
mother
of
course
he
could
not
now
confide
to
her
his
sentiments
regarding
fanny
or
make
this
worthy
lady
a
confidante
it
was
on
both
sides
an
unlucky
precaution
and
want
of
confidence
and
a
word
or
two
in
time
might
have
spared
the
good
lady
and
those
connected
with
her
a
deal
of
pain
and
anguish
seeing
miss
bolton
installed
as
nurse
and
tender
to
pen
i
am
sorry
to
say
pendennis
had
put
the
worst
construction
on
the
fact
of
the
intimacy
of
these
two
unlucky
young
persons
and
had
settled
in
her
own
mind
that
the
accusations
against
arthur
were
true
why
not
have
stopped
to
inquire
there
are
stories
to
a
man
disadvantage
that
the
women
who
are
fondest
of
him
are
always
the
most
eager
to
believe
is
a
man
wife
often
the
first
to
be
jealous
of
him
poor
pen
got
a
good
stock
of
this
suspicious
kind
of
love
from
the
nurse
who
was
now
watching
over
him
and
the
kind
and
pure
creature
thought
that
her
boy
had
gone
through
a
malady
much
more
awful
and
debasing
than
the
mere
physical
fever
and
was
stained
by
crime
as
well
as
weakened
by
illness
the
consciousness
of
this
she
had
to
bear
perforce
silently
and
to
try
to
put
a
mask
of
cheerfulness
and
confidence
over
her
doubt
and
despair
and
inward
horror
when
captain
shandon
at
boulogne
read
the
next
number
of
the
pall
mall
gazette
it
was
to
remark
to
shandon
that
jack
finucane
hand
was
no
longer
visible
in
the
leading
articles
and
that
warrington
must
be
at
work
there
again
i
know
the
crack
of
his
whip
in
a
hundred
and
the
cut
which
the
fellow
thong
leaves
there
jack
bludyer
goes
to
work
like
a
butcher
and
mangles
a
subject
warrington
finished
a
man
and
lays
his
cuts
neat
and
regular
straight
down
the
back
and
drawing
blood
every
line
at
which
dreadful
metaphor
shandon
said
law
charles
how
can
you
talk
so
i
always
thought
warrington
very
high
but
a
kind
gentleman
and
i
sure
he
was
most
kind
to
the
upon
which
shandon
said
yes
he
kind
to
the
children
but
he
savage
to
the
men
and
to
be
sure
my
dear
you
understand
a
word
about
what
i
saying
and
it
best
you
should
for
it
little
good
comes
out
of
writing
for
newspapers
and
better
here
living
easy
at
boulogne
where
the
wine
plenty
and
the
brandy
costs
but
two
francs
a
bottle
mix
us
another
tumbler
mary
my
dear
we
go
back
into
harness
soon
ingens
iterabimus
bad
luck
to
in
a
word
warrington
went
to
work
with
all
his
might
in
place
of
his
prostrate
friend
and
did
pen
portion
of
the
pall
mall
gazette
with
a
vengeance
as
the
saying
is
he
wrote
occasional
articles
and
literary
criticisms
he
attended
theatres
and
musical
performances
and
discoursed
about
them
with
his
usual
savage
energy
his
hand
was
too
strong
for
such
small
subjects
and
it
pleased
him
to
tell
mother
and
uncle
and
laura
that
there
was
no
hand
in
all
the
band
of
penmen
more
graceful
and
light
more
pleasant
and
more
elegant
than
arthur
the
people
in
this
country
do
understand
what
style
is
or
they
would
see
the
merits
of
our
young
one
he
said
to
pendennis
i
call
him
ours
for
i
bred
him
and
i
am
as
proud
of
him
as
you
are
and
bating
a
little
wilfulness
and
a
little
selfishness
and
a
little
dandification
i
do
know
a
more
honest
or
loyal
or
gentle
creature
his
pen
is
wicked
sometimes
but
he
is
as
kind
as
a
young
lady
as
miss
laura
here
and
i
believe
he
would
not
do
any
living
mortal
at
this
helen
though
she
heaved
a
deep
deep
sigh
and
laura
though
she
too
was
sadly
wounded
nevertheless
were
most
thankful
for
warrington
good
opinion
of
arthur
and
loved
him
for
being
so
attached
to
their
pen
and
major
pendennis
was
loud
in
his
praises
of
warrington
more
loud
and
enthusiastic
than
it
was
the
major
wont
to
be
he
is
a
gentleman
my
dear
creature
he
said
to
helen
every
inch
a
gentleman
my
good
madam
the
suffolk
warringtons
charles
the
first
baronets
what
could
he
be
but
a
gentleman
come
out
of
that
family
father
sir
miles
warrington
ran
away
with
beg
your
pardon
miss
bell
sir
miles
was
a
very
well
known
man
in
london
and
a
friend
of
the
prince
of
wales
this
gentleman
is
a
man
of
the
greatest
talents
the
very
highest
accomplishments
sure
to
get
on
if
he
had
a
motive
to
put
his
energies
to
laura
blushed
for
herself
whilst
the
major
was
talking
and
praising
arthur
hero
as
she
looked
at
warrington
manly
face
and
dark
melancholy
eyes
this
young
person
had
been
speculating
about
him
and
had
settled
in
her
mind
that
he
must
have
been
the
victim
of
an
unhappy
attachment
and
as
she
caught
herself
so
speculating
why
miss
bell
blushed
warrington
got
chambers
hard
by
grenier
chambers
in
flag
court
and
having
executed
pen
task
with
great
energy
in
the
morning
his
delight
and
pleasure
of
an
afternoon
was
to
come
and
sit
with
the
sick
company
in
the
sunny
autumn
evenings
and
he
had
the
honour
more
than
once
of
giving
miss
bell
his
arm
for
a
walk
in
the
temple
gardens
to
take
which
pastime
when
the
frank
laura
asked
of
helen
permission
the
major
eagerly
said
yes
yes
begad
of
course
you
go
out
with
him
it
like
the
country
you
know
everybody
goes
out
with
everybody
in
the
gardens
and
there
are
beadles
you
know
and
that
sort
of
thing
everybody
walks
in
the
temple
if
the
great
arbiter
of
morals
did
not
object
why
should
simple
helen
she
was
glad
that
her
girl
should
have
such
fresh
air
as
the
river
could
give
and
to
see
her
return
with
heightened
colour
and
spirits
from
these
harmless
excursions
laura
and
helen
had
come
you
must
know
to
a
little
explanation
when
the
news
arrived
of
pen
alarming
illness
laura
insisted
upon
accompanying
the
terrified
mother
to
london
would
not
hear
of
the
refusal
which
the
still
angry
helen
gave
her
and
when
refused
a
second
time
yet
more
sternly
and
when
it
seemed
that
the
poor
lost
lad
life
was
despaired
of
and
when
it
was
known
that
his
conduct
was
such
as
to
render
all
thoughts
of
union
hopeless
laura
had
with
many
tears
told
her
mother
a
secret
with
which
every
observant
person
who
reads
this
story
was
acquainted
already
now
she
never
could
marry
him
was
she
to
be
denied
the
consolation
of
owning
how
fondly
how
truly
how
entirely
she
had
loved
him
the
mingling
tears
of
the
woman
appeased
the
agony
of
their
grief
somewhat
and
the
sorrows
and
terrors
of
their
journey
were
at
least
in
so
far
mitigated
that
they
shared
them
together
what
could
fanny
expect
when
suddenly
brought
up
for
sentence
before
a
couple
of
such
judges
nothing
but
swift
condemnation
awful
punishment
merciless
dismissal
women
are
cruel
critics
in
cases
such
as
that
in
which
poor
fanny
was
implicated
and
we
like
them
to
be
so
for
besides
the
guard
which
a
man
places
round
his
own
harem
and
the
defences
which
a
woman
has
in
her
heart
her
faith
and
honour
has
she
all
her
own
friends
of
her
own
sex
to
keep
watch
that
she
does
not
go
astray
and
to
tear
her
to
pieces
if
she
is
found
erring
when
our
mahmouds
or
selims
of
baker
street
or
belgrave
square
visit
their
fatimas
with
condign
punishment
their
mothers
sew
up
fatima
sack
for
her
and
her
sisters
and
see
her
well
under
water
and
this
present
writer
does
not
say
nay
he
protests
most
solemnly
he
is
a
turk
too
he
wears
a
turban
and
a
beard
like
another
and
is
all
for
the
sack
practice
bismillah
but
o
you
spotless
who
have
the
right
of
capital
punishment
vested
in
you
at
least
be
very
cautious
that
you
make
away
with
the
proper
if
so
she
may
be
called
person
be
very
sure
of
the
fact
before
you
order
the
barge
out
and
do
pop
your
subject
into
the
bosphorus
until
you
are
quite
certain
that
she
deserves
it
this
is
all
i
would
urge
in
poor
fatima
behalf
absolutely
all
not
a
word
more
by
the
beard
of
the
prophet
if
she
guilty
down
with
her
heave
over
the
sack
away
with
it
into
the
golden
horn
bubble
and
squeak
and
justice
being
done
give
way
men
and
let
us
pull
back
to
supper
so
the
major
did
not
in
any
way
object
to
warrington
continued
promenades
with
miss
laura
but
like
a
benevolent
old
gentleman
encouraged
in
every
way
the
intimacy
of
that
couple
were
there
any
exhibitions
in
town
he
was
for
warrington
conducting
her
to
them
if
warrington
had
proposed
to
take
her
to
vauxhall
itself
this
most
complaisant
of
men
would
have
seen
no
harm
nor
would
helen
if
pendennis
the
elder
had
so
ruled
it
nor
would
there
have
been
any
harm
between
two
persons
whose
honour
was
entirely
spotless
between
warrington
who
saw
in
intimacy
a
pure
and
and
artless
woman
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
laura
who
too
for
the
first
time
was
thrown
into
the
constant
society
of
a
gentleman
of
great
natural
parts
and
powers
of
pleasing
who
possessed
varied
acquirements
enthusiasm
simplicity
humour
and
that
freshness
of
mind
which
his
simple
life
and
habits
gave
him
and
which
contrasted
so
much
with
pen
dandy
indifference
of
manner
and
faded
sneer
in
warrington
very
uncouthness
there
was
a
refinement
which
the
other
finery
lacked
in
his
energy
his
respect
his
desire
to
please
his
hearty
laughter
or
simple
confiding
pathos
what
a
difference
to
sultan
pen
yawning
sovereignty
and
languid
acceptance
of
homage
what
had
made
pen
at
home
such
a
dandy
and
such
a
despot
the
women
had
spoiled
him
as
we
like
them
and
as
they
like
to
do
they
had
cloyed
him
with
obedience
and
surfeited
him
with
sweet
respect
and
submission
until
he
grew
weary
of
the
slaves
who
waited
upon
him
and
their
caresses
and
cajoleries
excited
him
no
more
abroad
he
was
brisk
and
lively
and
eager
and
impassioned
enough
most
men
are
so
constituted
and
so
does
this
like
the
former
sentence
run
a
chance
of
being
misinterpreted
and
does
any
one
dare
to
suppose
that
the
writer
would
incite
the
women
to
revolt
nevert
by
the
whiskers
of
the
prophet
again
he
says
he
wears
a
beard
and
he
likes
his
women
to
be
slaves
what
man
does
what
man
would
be
henpecked
i
say
we
will
cut
off
all
the
heads
in
christendom
or
turkeydom
rather
than
that
well
then
arthur
being
so
languid
and
indifferent
and
careless
about
the
favours
bestowed
upon
him
how
came
it
that
laura
should
have
such
a
love
and
rapturous
regard
for
him
that
a
mere
inadequate
expression
of
it
should
have
kept
the
girl
talking
all
the
way
from
fairoaks
to
london
as
she
and
helen
travelled
in
the
as
soon
as
helen
had
finished
one
story
about
the
dear
fellow
and
narrated
with
a
hundred
sobs
and
ejaculations
and
looks
up
to
heaven
some
thrilling
incidents
which
occurred
about
the
period
when
the
hero
was
breeched
laura
began
another
equally
interesting
and
equally
ornamented
with
tears
and
told
how
heroically
he
had
a
tooth
out
or
would
have
it
out
or
how
daringly
he
robbed
a
bird
nest
or
how
magnanimously
he
spared
it
or
how
he
gave
a
shilling
to
the
old
woman
on
the
common
or
went
without
his
for
the
who
came
into
the
yard
and
so
on
one
to
another
the
sobbing
women
sang
laments
upon
their
hero
who
my
worthy
reader
has
long
since
perceived
is
no
more
a
hero
than
one
of
us
being
as
he
was
why
should
a
sensible
girl
be
so
fond
of
him
this
point
has
been
argued
before
in
a
previous
unfortunate
sentence
which
lately
drew
down
all
the
wrath
of
ireland
upon
the
head
and
which
said
that
the
greatest
have
had
somebody
to
be
fond
of
them
and
if
those
monsters
why
not
ordinary
mortals
and
with
whom
shall
a
young
lady
fall
in
love
but
with
the
person
she
sees
she
is
not
supposed
to
lose
her
heart
in
a
dream
like
a
princess
in
the
arabian
nights
or
to
plight
her
young
affections
to
the
portrait
of
a
gentleman
in
the
exhibition
or
a
sketch
in
the
illustrated
london
news
you
have
an
instinct
within
you
which
inclines
you
to
attach
yourself
to
some
one
you
meet
somebody
you
hear
somebody
constantly
praised
you
walk
or
ride
or
waltz
or
talk
or
sit
in
the
same
pew
at
church
with
somebody
you
meet
again
and
again
and
marriages
are
made
in
heave
your
dear
mamma
says
pinning
your
wreath
on
with
her
blessed
eyes
dimmed
with
tears
and
there
is
a
wedding
breakfast
and
you
take
off
your
white
satin
and
retire
to
your
and
you
and
he
are
a
happy
or
the
affair
is
broken
off
and
then
poor
wounded
heart
why
then
you
meet
somebody
else
and
twine
your
young
affections
round
number
two
it
is
your
nature
so
to
do
do
you
suppose
it
is
all
for
the
man
sake
that
you
love
and
not
a
bit
for
your
own
do
you
suppose
you
would
drink
if
you
were
not
thirsty
or
eat
if
you
were
not
hungry
so
then
laura
liked
pen
because
she
saw
scarcely
anybody
else
at
fairoaks
except
doctor
portman
and
captain
glanders
and
because
his
mother
constantly
praised
her
arthur
and
because
he
was
gentlemanlike
tolerably
and
witty
and
because
above
all
it
was
of
her
nature
to
like
somebody
and
having
once
received
this
image
into
her
heart
she
there
tenderly
nursed
it
and
clasped
it
she
there
in
his
long
absences
and
her
constant
solitudes
silently
brooded
over
it
and
fondled
it
and
when
after
this
she
came
to
london
and
had
an
opportunity
of
becoming
rather
intimate
with
george
warrington
what
on
earth
was
to
prevent
her
from
thinking
him
a
most
odd
original
agreeable
and
pleasing
person
a
long
time
afterwards
when
these
days
were
over
and
fate
in
its
own
way
had
disposed
of
the
various
persons
now
assembled
in
the
dingy
building
in
lamb
court
perhaps
some
of
them
looked
back
and
thought
how
happy
the
time
was
and
how
pleasant
had
been
their
evening
talks
and
little
walks
and
simple
recreations
round
the
sofa
of
pen
the
convalescent
the
major
had
a
favourable
opinion
of
september
in
london
from
that
time
forward
and
declared
at
his
clubs
and
in
society
that
the
dead
season
in
town
was
often
pleasant
doosid
pleasant
begad
he
used
to
go
home
to
his
lodgings
in
bury
street
of
a
night
wondering
that
it
was
already
so
late
and
that
the
evening
had
passed
away
so
quickly
he
made
his
appearance
at
the
temple
pretty
constantly
in
the
afternoon
and
tugged
up
the
long
black
staircase
with
quite
a
benevolent
activity
and
perseverance
and
he
made
interest
with
the
chef
at
bays
that
renowned
cook
the
superintendence
of
whose
work
upon
gastronomy
compelled
the
gifted
author
to
stay
in
the
metropolis
to
prepare
little
jellies
delicate
clear
soups
aspics
and
other
trifles
good
for
invalids
which
morgan
the
valet
constantly
brought
down
to
the
little
lamb
court
colony
and
the
permission
to
drink
a
glass
or
two
of
pure
sherry
being
accorded
to
pen
by
doctor
goodenough
the
major
told
with
almost
tears
in
his
eyes
how
his
noble
friend
the
marquis
of
steyne
passing
through
london
on
his
way
to
the
continent
had
ordered
any
quantity
of
his
precious
his
priceless
amontillado
that
had
been
a
present
from
king
ferdinand
to
the
noble
marquis
to
be
placed
at
the
disposal
of
arthur
pendennis
the
widow
and
laura
tasted
it
with
respect
though
they
did
in
the
least
like
the
bitter
flavour
but
the
invalid
was
greatly
invigorated
by
it
and
warrington
pronounced
it
superlatively
good
and
proposed
the
major
health
in
a
mock
speech
after
dinner
on
the
first
day
when
the
wine
was
served
and
that
of
lord
steyne
and
the
aristocracy
in
general
major
pendennis
returned
thanks
with
the
utmost
gravity
and
in
a
speech
in
which
he
used
the
words
present
occasion
at
least
the
proper
number
of
times
pen
cheered
with
his
feeble
voice
from
his
armchair
warrington
taught
miss
laura
to
cry
hear
hear
and
tapped
the
table
with
his
knuckles
pidgeon
the
attendant
grinned
and
honest
doctor
goodenough
found
the
party
so
merrily
engaged
when
he
came
in
to
pay
his
faithful
gratuitous
visit
warrington
knew
sibwright
who
lived
below
and
that
gallant
gentleman
in
reply
to
a
letter
informing
him
of
the
use
to
which
his
apartment
had
been
put
wrote
back
the
most
polite
and
flowery
letter
of
acquiescence
he
placed
his
chambers
at
the
service
of
their
fair
occupants
his
bed
at
their
disposal
his
carpets
at
their
feet
everybody
was
kindly
disposed
towards
the
sick
man
and
his
family
his
heart
and
his
mother
too
as
we
may
fancy
melted
within
him
at
the
thought
of
so
much
and
let
pen
biographer
be
pardoned
for
alluding
to
a
time
not
far
distant
when
a
somewhat
similar
mishap
brought
him
a
providential
friend
a
kind
physician
and
a
thousand
proofs
of
a
most
touching
and
surprising
kindness
and
sympathy
there
was
a
piano
in
sibwright
chamber
indeed
this
gentleman
a
lover
of
all
the
arts
performed
himself
and
excellently
ill
too
upon
the
instrument
and
had
had
a
song
dedicated
to
him
the
words
by
himself
the
air
by
his
devoted
friend
leopoldo
twankidillo
and
at
this
as
warrington
called
it
laura
at
first
with
a
great
deal
of
tremor
and
blushing
which
became
her
very
much
played
and
sang
sometimes
of
an
evening
simple
airs
and
old
songs
of
home
her
voice
was
a
rich
contralto
and
warrington
who
scarcely
knew
one
tune
from
another
and
who
had
but
one
tune
or
bray
in
his
repertoire
a
most
discordant
imitation
of
save
the
king
sat
rapt
in
delight
listening
to
these
songs
he
could
follow
their
rhythm
if
not
their
harmony
and
he
could
watch
with
a
constant
and
daily
growing
enthusiasm
the
pure
and
tender
and
generous
creature
who
made
the
music
i
wonder
how
that
poor
pale
little
girl
in
the
black
bonnet
who
used
to
stand
at
the
in
lamb
court
sometimes
of
an
evening
looking
up
to
the
open
windows
from
which
the
music
came
liked
to
hear
it
when
pen
bedtime
came
the
songs
were
hushed
lights
appeared
in
the
upper
room
his
room
whither
the
widow
used
to
conduct
him
and
then
the
major
and
warrington
and
sometimes
miss
laura
would
have
a
game
at
ecarte
or
backgammon
or
she
would
sit
by
working
a
pair
of
slippers
in
worsted
a
pair
of
gentleman
slippers
they
might
have
been
for
arthur
or
for
george
or
for
major
pendennis
one
of
those
three
would
have
given
anything
for
the
slippers
whilst
such
business
as
this
was
going
on
within
a
rather
shabby
old
gentleman
would
come
and
lead
away
the
pale
girl
in
the
black
bonnet
who
had
no
right
to
be
abroad
in
the
night
air
and
the
temple
porters
the
few
laundresses
and
other
amateurs
who
had
been
listening
to
the
concert
would
also
disappear
just
before
ten
there
was
another
musical
performance
namely
that
of
the
chimes
of
clement
clock
in
the
strand
which
played
the
clear
cheerful
notes
of
a
psalm
before
it
proceeded
to
ring
its
ten
fatal
strokes
as
they
were
ringing
laura
began
to
fold
up
the
slippers
martha
from
fairoaks
appeared
with
a
and
a
constant
smile
on
her
face
the
major
said
god
bless
my
soul
is
it
so
late
warrington
and
he
left
their
unfinished
game

as

descended
they
could
hear
her
bolting
and
locking
the
sporting
door
after
them
upon
her
young
mistress
and
herself
if
there
had
been
any
danger
grinning
martha
said
she
would
have
got
down
that
thar

which
hung
up
in

meaning
the
damascus
scimitar
with
the
names
of
the
prophet
engraved
on

and
the

percy
sibwright
esquire
brought
back
from

been
presented
to

good
night
laura
and

martha
sleep
well
and
wake
happy
pure
and
gentle
lady
sometimes
after
these
evenings
warrington
would
walk
a
little
way
with
major
pendennis
just
a
little
way
just
as
far
as
the
temple
gate
as
the
strand
as
charing
cross
as
the
club
he
was
not
going
into
the
club
well
as
far
as
bury
street
where
he
would
laughingly
shake
hands
on
the
major
own
they
had
been
talking
about
laura
all
the
way
it
was
wonderful
how
enthusiastic
the
major
who
as
we
know
used
to
dislike
her
had
grown
to
be
regarding
the
young
lady
fine
girl
begad
girl
my
has
the
manners
of
a
duchess
and
would
bring
up
any
girl
well
miss
bell
a
little
countryfied
but
the
smell
of
the
hawthorn
is
pleasant
demmy
how
she
blushes
your
london
girls
would
give
many
a
guinea
for
a
bouquet
like
that
natural
flowers
begad
and
she
a
little
money
too
nothing
to
speak
of
but
a
pooty
little
bit
of
in
all
which
opinions
no
doubt
warrington
agreed
and
though
he
laughed
as
he
shook
hands
with
the
major
his
face
fell
as
he
left
his
veteran
companion
and
he
strode
back
to
chambers
and
smoked
pipe
after
pipe
long
into
the
night
and
wrote
article
upon
article
more
and
more
savage
in
lieu
of
friend
pen
disabled
well
it
was
a
happy
time
for
almost
all
parties
concerned
pen
mended
daily
sleeping
and
eating
were
his
constant
occupations
his
appetite
was
something
frightful
he
was
ashamed
of
exhibiting
it
before
laura
and
almost
before
his
mother
who
laughed
and
applauded
him
as
the
roast
chicken
of
his
dinner
went
away
he
eyed
the
departing
friend
with
sad
longing
and
began
to
long
for
jelly
or
tea
or
what
not
he
was
like
an
ogre
in
devouring
the
doctor
cried
stop
but
pen
would
not
nature
called
out
to
him
more
loudly
than
the
doctor
and
that
kind
and
friendly
physician
handed
him
over
with
a
very
good
grace
to
the
other
healer
and
here
let
us
speak
very
tenderly
and
in
the
strictest
confidence
of
an
event
which
befell
him
and
to
which
he
never
liked
an
allusion
during
his
delirium
the
ruthless
goodenough
ordered
ice
to
be
put
to
his
head
and
all
his
lovely
hair
to
be
cut
it
was
done
in
the
time
of
of
the
other
nurse
who
left
every
single
hair
of
course
in
a
paper
for
the
widow
to
count
and
treasure
up
she
never
believed
but
that
the
girl
had
taken
away
some
of
it
but
then
women
are
so
suspicious
upon
these
matters
when
this
direful
loss
was
made
visible
to
major
pendennis
as
of
course
it
was
the
first
time
the
elder
saw
the
poor
young
man
shorn
pate
and
when
pen
was
quite
out
of
danger
and
gaining
daily
vigour
the
major
with
something
like
blushes
and
a
queer
wink
of
his
eyes
said
he
knew
of
a
a
person
a
coiffeur
in
fact
a
good
man
whom
he
would
send
down
to
the
temple
and
who
would
a
apply
a
a
temporary
remedy
to
that
misfortune
laura
looked
at
warrington
with
the
archest
sparkle
in
her
eyes
warrington
fairly
burst
out
into
a
boohoo
of
laughter
even
the
widow
was
obliged
to
laugh
and
the
major
erubescent
confounded
the
impudence
of
the
young
folks
and
said
when
he
had
his
hair
cut
he
would
keep
a
lock
of
it
for
miss
laura
warrington
voted
that
pen
should
wear
a
barrister
wig
there
was
sibwright
down
below
which
would
become
him
hugely
pen
said
stuff
and
seemed
as
confused
as
his
uncle
and
the
end
was
that
a
gentleman
from
burlington
arcade
waited
next
day
upon
pendennis
and
had
a
private
interview
with
him
in
his
bedroom
and
a
week
afterwards
the
same
individual
appeared
with
a
box
under
his
arm
and
an
ineffable
grin
of
politeness
on
his
face
and
announced
that
he
had
brought
pendennis
of
it
must
have
been
a
grand
but
melancholy
sight
to
see
pen
in
the
recesses
of
his
apartment
sadly
contemplating
his
ravaged
beauty
and
the
artificial
means
of
hiding
its
ruin
he
appeared
at
length
in
the
of
but
warrington
laughed
so
that
pen
grew
sulky
and
went
back
for
his
velvet
cap
a
neat
turban
which
the
fondest
of
mammas
had
worked
for
him
then
warrington
and
miss
bell
got
some
flowers
off
the
ladies
bonnets
and
made
a
wreath
with
which
they
decorated
the
wig
and
brought
it
out
in
procession
and
did
homage
before
it
in
fact
they
indulged
in
a
hundred
sports
jularities
waggeries
and
petits
jeux
innocens
so
that
the
second
and
third
floors
of
number
lamb
court
temple
rang
with
more
cheerfulness
and
laughter
than
had
been
known
in
those
precincts
for
many
a
long
day
at
last
after
about
ten
days
of
this
life
one
evening
when
the
little
spy
of
the
court
came
out
to
take
her
usual
post
of
observation
at
the
lamp
there
was
no
music
from
the
window
there
were
no
lights
in
the
chambers
the
windows
of
each
were
open
and
the
occupants
were
gone
flanagan
the
laundress
told
fanny
what
had
happened
the
ladies
and
all
the
party
had
gone
to
richmond
for
change
of
air
the
antique
travelling
chariot
was
brought
out
again
and
cushioned
with
many
pillows
for
pen
and
his
mother
and
miss
laura
went
in
the
most
affable
manner
in
the
omnibus
under
the
guardianship
of
george
warrington
he
came
back
and
took
possession
of
his
old
bed
that
night
in
the
vacant
and
cheerless
chambers
and
to
his
old
books
and
his
old
pipes
but
not
perhaps
to
his
old
sleep
the
widow
had
left
a
jar
full
of
flowers
upon
his
table
prettily
arranged
and
when
he
entered
they
filled
the
solitary
room
with
odour
they
were
memorials
of
the
kind
gentle
souls
who
had
gone
away
and
who
had
decorated
for
a
little
while
that
lonely
cheerless
place
he
had
had
the
happiest
days
of
his
whole
life
george
felt
he
knew
it
now
they
were
just
gone
he
went
and
took
up
the
flowers
and
put
his
face
to
them
and
smelt
them
perhaps
kissed
them
as
he
put
them
down
he
rubbed
his
rough
hand
across
his
eyes
with
a
bitter
word
and
laugh
he
would
have
given
his
whole
life
and
soul
to
win
that
prize
which
arthur
rejected
did
she
want
fame
he
would
have
won
it
for
her
devotion
a
great
heart
full
of
tenderness
and
manly
love
and
gentleness
was
there
for
her
if
she
might
take
it
but
it
might
not
be
fate
had
ruled
otherwise
even
if
i
could
she
would
not
have
me
george
thought
what
has
an
ugly
rough
old
fellow
like
me
to
make
any
woman
like
him
i
getting
old
and
i
made
no
mark
in
life
i
neither
good
looks
nor
youth
nor
money
nor
reputation
a
man
must
be
able
to
do
something
besides
stare
at
her
and
offer
on
his
knees
his
smooth
devotion
to
make
a
woman
like
him
what
can
i
do
lots
of
young
fellows
have
passed
me
in
the
race
what
they
call
the
prizes
of
life
did
seem
to
me
worth
the
trouble
of
the
struggle
but
for
her
if
she
had
been
mine
and
liked
a
diamond
ah
should
she
have
worn
it
psha
what
a
fool
i
am
to
brag
of
what
i
would
have
done
we
are
the
slaves
of
destiny
our
lots
are
shaped
for
us
and
mine
is
ordained
long
ago
come
let
us
have
a
pipe
and
put
the
smell
of
these
flowers
out
of
court
poor
little
silent
flowers
you
be
dead
what
business
had
you
to
show
your
red
cheeks
in
this
dingy
place
by
his
bedside
george
found
a
new
bible
which
the
widow
had
placed
there
with
a
note
inside
saying
that
she
had
not
seen
the
book
amongst
his
collection
in
a
room
where
she
had
spent
a
number
of
hours
and
where
god
had
vouchsafed
to
her
prayers
the
life
of
her
son
and
that
she
gave
to
arthur
friend
the
best
thing
she
could
and
besought
him
to
read
in
the
volume
sometimes
and
to
keep
it
as
a
token
of
a
grateful
mother
regard
and
affection
poor
george
mournfully
kissed
the
book
as
he
had
done
the
flowers
and
the
morning
found
him
still
reading
in
its
awful
pages
in
which
so
many
stricken
hearts
in
which
so
many
tender
and
faithful
souls
have
found
comfort
under
calamity
and
refuge
and
hope
in
affliction
chapter
lv
fanny
occupation
gone
good
helen
ever
since
her
son
illness
had
taken
as
we
have
seen
entire
possession
of
the
young
man
of
his
drawers
and
closets
and
all
which
they
contained
whether
shirts
that
wanted
buttons
or
stockings
that
required
mending
or
must
it
be
owned
letters
that
lay
amongst
those
articles
of
raiment
and
which
of
course
it
was
necessary
that
somebody
should
answer
during
arthur
weakened
and
incapable
condition
perhaps
pendennis
was
laudably
desirous
to
have
some
explanations
about
the
dreadful
fanny
bolton
mystery
regarding
which
she
had
never
breathed
a
word
to
her
son
though
it
was
present
in
her
mind
always
and
occasioned
her
inexpressible
anxiety
and
disquiet
she
had
caused
the
brass
knocker
to
be
screwed
off
the
inner
door
of
the
chambers
where
upon
the
postman
startling
double
rap
would
as
she
justly
argued
disturb
the
rest
of
her
patient
and
she
did
not
allow
him
to
see
any
letter
which
arrived
whether
from
bootmakers
who
importuned
him
or
hatters
who
had
a
heavy
account
to
make
up
against
next
saturday
and
would
be
very
much
obliged
if
arthur
pendennis
would
have
the
kindness
to
settle
etc
of
these
documents
pen
who
was
always
freehanded
and
careless
of
course
had
his
share
and
though
no
great
one
one
quite
enough
to
alarm
his
scrupulous
and
conscientious
mother
she
had
some
savings
pen
magnificent
and
her
own
economy
amounting
from
her
great
simplicity
and
avoidance
of
show
to
parsimony
almost
had
enabled
her
to
put
by
a
little
sum
of
money
a
part
of
which
she
delightedly
consecrated
to
the
paying
off
the
young
gentleman
obligations
at
this
price
many
a
worthy
youth
and
respected
reader
would
hand
over
his
correspondence
to
his
parents
and
perhaps
there
is
no
greater
test
of
a
man
regularity
and
easiness
of
conscience
than
his
readiness
to
face
the
postman
blessed
is
he
who
is
made
happy
by
the
sound
of
the
the
good
are
eager
for
it
but
the
naughty
tremble
at
the
sound
thereof
so
it
was
very
kind
of
pendennis
doubly
to
spare
pen
the
trouble
of
hearing
or
answering
letters
during
his
illness
there
could
have
been
nothing
in
the
young
man
chest
of
drawers
and
wardrobes
which
could
be
considered
as
inculpating
him
in
any
way
nor
any
satisfactory
documents
regarding
the
fanny
bolton
affair
found
there
for
the
widow
had
to
ask
her
if
he
knew
anything
about
the
odious
transaction
and
the
dreadful
intrigue
about
which
her
son
was
engaged
when
they
were
at
richmond
one
day
and
pen
with
warrington
had
taken
a
seat
on
a
bench
on
the
terrace
the
widow
kept
major
pendennis
in
consultation
and
laid
her
terrors
and
perplexities
before
him
such
of
them
at
least
for
as
is
the
wont
of
men
and
women
she
did
not
make
quite
a
clean
confession
and
i
suppose
no
spendthrift
asked
for
a
schedule
of
his
debts
no
lady
of
fashion
asked
by
her
husband
for
her
dressmaker
bills
ever
sent
in
the
whole
of
them
yet
such
we
say
of
her
perplexities
at
least
as
she
chose
to
confide
to
her
director
for
the
time
being
when
then
she
asked
the
major
what
course
she
ought
to
pursue
about
this
dreadful
this
horrid
affair
and
whether
he
knew
anything
regarding
it
the
old
gentleman
puckered
up
his
face
so
that
you
could
not
tell
whether
he
was
smiling
or
not
gave
the
widow
one
queer
look
with
his
little
eyes
cast
them
down
to
the
carpet
again
and
said
my
dear
good
creature
i
do
know
anything
about
it
and
i
do
wish
to
know
anything
about
it
and
as
you
ask
me
my
opinion
i
think
you
had
best
know
nothing
about
it
too
young
men
will
be
young
men
begad
and
my
good
if
you
think
our
boy
is
a
jo
pray
spare
me
this
helen
broke
in
looking
very
stately
my
dear
creature
i
did
not
commence
the
conversation
permit
me
to
say
the
major
said
bowing
very
blandly
i
ca
bear
to
hear
such
a
sin
such
a
dreadful
sin
spoken
of
in
such
a
way
the
widow
said
with
tears
of
annoyance
starting
from
her
eyes
i
ca
bear
to
think
that
my
boy
should
commit
such
a
crime
i
wish
he
had
died
almost
before
he
had
done
it
i
do
know
how
i
survive
it
myself
for
it
is
breaking
my
heart
major
pendennis
to
think
that
his
father
son
my
child
whom
i
remember
so
good
oh
so
good
and
full
of
honour
should
be
fallen
so
dreadfully
low
as
to
as
to
as
to
flirt
with
a
little
grisette
my
dear
creature
said
the
major
egad
if
all
the
mothers
in
england
were
to
break
their
hearts
because
nay
nay
upon
my
word
and
honour
now
do
agitate
yourself
do
cry
i
ca
bear
to
see
a
woman
tears
i
never
could
never
but
how
do
we
know
that
anything
serious
has
happened
has
arthur
said
anything
his
silence
confirms
it
sobbed
pendennis
behind
her
not
at
all
there
are
subjects
my
dear
about
which
a
young
fellow
can
not
surely
talk
to
his
mamma
insinuated
the
she
has
written
to
him
cried
the
lady
behind
the
cambric
what
before
he
was
ill
nothing
more
no
since
the
mourner
with
the
batiste
mask
gasped
out
not
before
that
is
i
do
think
so
that
is
i
only
since
and
you
have
yes
i
understand
i
suppose
when
he
was
too
ill
to
read
his
own
correspondence
you
took
charge
of
it
did
you
i
am
the
most
unhappy
mother
in
the
world
cried
out
the
unfortunate
helen
the
most
unhappy
mother
in
the
world
because
your
son
is
a
man
and
not
a
hermit
have
a
care
my
dear
sister
if
you
have
suppressed
any
letters
to
him
you
may
have
done
yourself
a
great
injury
and
if
i
know
anything
of
arthur
spirit
may
cause
a
difference
between
him
and
you
which
you
rue
all
your
life
a
difference
that
a
deal
more
important
my
good
madam
than
the
little
little
trumpery
cause
which
originated
there
was
only
one
letter
broke
out
helen
only
a
very
little
one
only
a
few
words
here
it
is
oh
how
can
you
how
can
you
speak
so
when
the
good
soul
said
only
a
very
little
one
the
major
could
not
speak
at
all
so
inclined
was
he
to
laugh
in
spite
of
the
agonies
of
the
poor
soul
before
him
and
for
whom
he
had
a
hearty
pity
and
liking
too
but
each
was
looking
at
the
matter
with
his
or
her
peculiar
eyes
and
views
of
morals
and
the
major
morals
as
the
reader
knows
were
not
those
of
an
ascetic
i
recommend
you
he
gravely
continued
if
you
can
to
seal
it
up
those
letters
ai
unfrequently
sealed
with
wafers
and
to
put
it
amongst
pen
other
letters
and
let
him
have
them
when
he
calls
for
them
or
if
we
ca
seal
it
we
mistook
it
for
a
i
ca
tell
my
son
a
lie
said
the
widow
it
had
been
put
silently
into
the
two
days
previous
to
their
departure
from
the
temple
and
had
been
brought
to
pendennis
by
martha
she
had
never
seen
fanny
handwriting
of
course
but
when
the
letter
was
put
into
her
hands
she
knew
the
author
at
once
she
had
been
on
the
watch
for
that
letter
every
day
since
pen
had
been
she
had
opened
some
of
his
other
letters
because
she
wanted
to
get
at
that
one
she
had
the
horrid
paper
poisoning
her
bag
at
that
moment
she
took
it
out
and
offered
it
to
her
arther
pendennis
he
read
in
a
timid
little
sprawling
handwriting
and
with
a
sneer
on
his
face
no
my
dear
i
read
any
more
but
you
who
have
read
it
may
tell
me
what
the
letter
contains
only
prayers
for
his
health
in
bad
spelling
you
say
and
a
desire
to
see
him
well
there
no
harm
in
that
and
as
you
ask
me
here
the
major
began
to
look
a
little
queer
for
his
own
part
and
put
on
his
demure
look
as
you
ask
me
my
dear
for
information
why
i
mind
telling
you
that
ah
that
morgan
my
man
has
made
some
inquiries
regarding
this
affair
and
that
my
friend
doctor
goodenough
also
looked
into
it
and
it
appears
that
this
person
was
greatly
smitten
with
arthur
that
he
paid
for
her
and
took
her
to
vauxhall
gardens
as
morgan
heard
from
an
old
acquaintance
of
pen
and
ours
an
irish
gentleman
who
was
very
nearly
once
having
the
honour
of
being
the
from
an
irishman
in
fact
that
the
girl
father
a
violent
man
of
intoxicated
habits
has
beaten
her
mother
who
persists
in
declaring
her
entire
innocence
to
her
husband
on
the
one
hand
while
on
the
other
she
told
goodenough
that
arthur
has
acted
like
a
brute
to
her
child
and
so
you
see
the
story
remains
in
a
mystery
will
you
have
it
cleared
up
i
have
but
to
ask
pen
and
he
will
tell
me
at
once
he
is
as
honourable
a
man
as
ever
honourable
said
the
widow
with
bitter
scorn
oh
brother
what
is
this
you
call
honour
if
my
boy
has
been
guilty
he
must
marry
her
i
would
go
down
on
my
knees
and
pray
him
to
do
good
god
are
you
mad
screamed
out
the
major
and
remembering
former
passages
in
arthur
history
and
helen
the
truth
came
across
his
mind
that
were
helen
to
make
this
prayer
to
her
son
he
would
marry
the
girl
he
was
wild
enough
and
obstinate
enough
to
commit
any
folly
when
a
woman
he
loved
was
in
the
case
my
dear
sister
have
you
lost
your
senses
he
continued
after
an
agitated
pause
during
which
the
above
dreary
reflection
crossed
him
and
in
a
softened
tone
what
right
have
we
to
suppose
that
anything
has
passed
between
this
girl
and
him
see
the
letter
her
heart
is
breaking
pray
pray
write
to
me
home
unhappy
unkind
father
your
nurse
poor
little
fanny
spelt
as
you
say
in
a
manner
to
outrage
all
sense
of
decorum
but
good
heavens
my
dear
what
is
there
in
this
only
that
the
little
devil
is
making
love
to
him
still
why
she
did
come
into
his
chambers
until
he
was
so
delirious
that
he
did
know
her
flanagan
the
laundress
told
morgan
my
man
so
she
came
in
company
of
an
old
fellow
an
old
bows
who
came
most
kindly
down
to
stillbrook
and
brought
me
away
by
the
way
i
left
him
in
the
cab
and
never
paid
the
fare
and
kind
it
was
of
him
no
there
nothing
in
the
do
you
think
so
thank
heaven
thank
god
helen
cried
i
take
the
letter
to
arthur
and
ask
him
now
look
at
him
there
he
on
the
terrace
with
warrington
they
are
talking
to
some
children
my
boy
was
always
fond
of
children
he
innocent
thank
god
thank
god
let
me
go
to
old
pendennis
had
his
own
opinion
when
he
briskly
took
the
not
guilty
side
of
the
case
but
a
moment
before
very
likely
the
old
gentleman
had
a
different
view
from
that
which
he
chose
to
advocate
and
judged
of
arthur
by
what
he
himself
would
have
done
if
she
goes
to
arthur
and
he
speaks
the
truth
as
the
rascal
will
it
spoils
all
he
thought
and
he
tried
one
more
effort
my
dear
good
soul
he
said
taking
helen
hand
and
kissing
it
as
your
son
has
not
acquainted
you
with
this
affair
think
if
you
have
any
right
to
examine
it
as
you
believe
him
to
be
a
man
of
honour
what
right
have
you
to
doubt
his
honour
in
this
instance
who
is
his
accuser
an
anonymous
scoundrel
who
has
brought
no
specific
charge
against
him
if
there
were
any
such
would
the
girl
parents
have
come
forward
he
is
not
called
upon
to
rebut
nor
you
to
entertain
an
anonymous
accusation
and
as
for
believing
him
guilty
because
a
girl
of
that
rank
happened
to
be
in
his
rooms
acting
as
nurse
to
him
begad
you
might
as
well
insist
upon
his
marrying
that
dem
old
irish
laundress
the
widow
burst
out
laughing
through
her
tears
the
victory
was
gained
by
the
old
general
marry
flanagan
by
ged
he
continued
tapping
her
slender
hand
no
the
boy
has
told
you
nothing
about
it
and
you
know
nothing
about
it
the
boy
is
innocent
of
course
and
what
my
good
soul
is
the
course
for
us
to
pursue
suppose
he
is
attached
to
this
girl
do
look
sad
again
it
merely
a
supposition
and
begad
a
young
fellow
may
have
an
attachment
may
he
directly
he
gets
well
he
will
be
at
her
he
must
come
home
we
must
go
off
directly
to
fairoaks
the
widow
cried
out
my
good
creature
he
bore
himself
to
death
at
fairoaks
he
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
think
about
his
passion
there
there
no
place
in
the
world
for
making
a
little
passion
into
a
big
one
and
where
a
fellow
feeds
on
his
own
thoughts
like
a
dem
lonely
where
there
nothing
to
do
we
must
occupy
him
amuse
him
we
must
take
him
abroad
he
never
been
abroad
except
to
paris
for
a
lark
we
must
travel
a
little
he
must
have
a
nurse
with
him
to
take
great
care
of
him
for
goodenough
says
he
had
a
narrow
squeak
of
it
look
frightened
and
so
you
must
come
and
watch
and
i
suppose
take
miss
bell
and
i
should
like
to
ask
warrington
to
come
arthur
fond
of
warrington
he
ca
do
without
warrington
warrington
family
is
one
of
the
oldest
in
england
and
he
is
one
of
the
best
young
fellows
i
ever
met
in
my
life
i
like
him
does
warrington
know
anything
about
this
this
affair
asked
helen
he
had
been
away
i
know
for
two
months
before
it
happened
pen
wrote
me
not
a
word
i
i
asked
him
about
it
i
pumped
him
he
never
heard
of
the
transaction
never
i
pledge
you
my
word
cried
out
the
major
in
some
alarm
and
my
dear
i
think
you
had
much
best
not
talk
to
him
about
it
much
best
not
of
course
not
the
subject
is
most
delicate
and
the
simple
widow
took
her
brother
hand
and
pressed
it
thank
you
brother
she
said
you
have
been
very
very
kind
to
me
you
have
given
me
a
great
deal
of
comfort
i
go
to
my
room
and
think
of
what
you
have
said
this
illness
and
these
these
emotions
have
agitated
me
a
great
deal
and
i
not
very
strong
you
know
but
i
go
and
thank
god
that
my
boy
is
innocent
he
is
innocent
is
he
sir
yes
my
dearest
creature
yes
said
the
old
fellow
kissing
her
affectionately
and
quite
overcome
by
her
tenderness
he
looked
after
her
as
she
retreated
with
a
fondness
which
was
rendered
more
piquant
as
it
were
by
the
mixture
of
a
certain
scorn
which
accompanied
it
innocent
he
said
i
swear
till
i
was
black
in
the
face
he
was
innocent
rather
than
give
that
good
soul
having
achieved
this
victory
the
fatigued
and
happy
warrior
laid
himself
down
on
the
sofa
and
put
his
yellow
silk
over
his
face
and
indulged
in
a
snug
little
nap
of
which
the
dreams
no
doubt
were
very
pleasant
as
he
snored
with
refreshing
regularity
the
young
men
sate
meanwhile
dawdling
away
the
sunshiny
hours
on
the
terrace
very
happy
and
pen
at
least
very
talkative
he
was
narrating
to
warrington
a
plan
for
a
new
novel
and
a
new
tragedy
warrington
laughed
at
the
idea
of
his
writing
a
tragedy
by
jove
he
would
show
that
he
could
and
he
began
to
spout
some
of
the
lines
of
his
play
the
little
solo
on
the
wind
instrument
which
the
major
was
performing
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
miss
bell
she
had
been
on
a
visit
to
her
old
friend
lady
rockminster
who
had
taken
a
summer
villa
in
the
neighbourhood
and
who
hearing
of
arthur
illness
and
his
arrival
at
richmond
had
visited
the
latter
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
former
whom
she
did
like
had
been
prodigal
of
grapes
partridges
and
other
attentions
for
laura
the
old
lady
had
a
great
fondness
and
longed
that
she
should
come
and
stay
with
her
but
laura
could
not
leave
her
mother
at
this
juncture
worn
out
by
constant
watching
over
arthur
health
helen
own
had
suffered
very
considerably
and
doctor
goodenough
had
had
reason
to
prescribe
for
her
as
well
as
for
his
younger
patient
old
pendennis
started
up
on
the
entrance
of
the
young
lady
his
slumbers
were
easily
broken
he
made
her
a
gallant
speech
he
had
been
full
of
gallantry
towards
her
of
late
where
had
she
been
gathering
those
roses
which
she
wore
on
her
cheeks
how
happy
he
was
to
be
disturbed
out
of
his
dreams
by
such
a
charming
reality
laura
had
plenty
of
humour
and
honesty
and
these
two
caused
her
to
have
on
her
side
something
very
like
a
contempt
for
the
old
gentleman
it
delighted
her
to
draw
out
his
worldlinesses
and
to
make
the
old
habitue
of
clubs
and
tell
his
twaddling
tales
about
great
folks
and
expound
his
views
of
morals
not
in
this
instance
however
was
she
disposed
to
be
satirical
she
had
been
to
drive
with
lady
rockminster
in
the
park
she
said
and
she
had
brought
home
game
for
pen
and
flowers
for
mamma
she
looked
very
grave
about
mamma
she
had
just
been
with
pendennis
helen
was
very
much
worn
and
she
feared
she
was
very
very
ill
her
large
eyes
filled
with
tender
marks
of
the
sympathy
which
she
felt
in
her
beloved
condition
she
was
alarmed
about
her
could
not
that
good
that
dear
goodenough
cure
her
arthur
illness
and
other
mental
anxiety
the
major
slowly
said
had
no
doubt
shaken
a
burning
blush
upon
the
girl
face
showed
that
she
understood
the
old
man
allusion
but
she
looked
him
full
in
the
face
and
made
no
reply
he
might
have
spared
me
that
she
thought
what
is
he
aiming
at
in
recalling
that
shame
to
me
that
he
had
an
aim
in
view
is
very
possible
the
old
diplomatist
seldom
spoke
without
some
such
end
doctor
goodenough
had
talked
to
him
he
said
about
their
dear
friend
health
and
she
wanted
rest
and
change
of
scene
yes
change
of
scene
painful
circumstances
which
had
occurred
must
be
forgotten
and
never
alluded
to
he
begged
pardon
for
even
hinting
at
them
to
miss
bell
he
never
should
do
so
again
nor
he
was
sure
would
she
everything
must
be
done
to
soothe
and
comfort
their
friend
and
his
proposal
was
that
they
should
go
abroad
for
the
autumn
to
a
in
the
rhine
neighbourhood
where
helen
might
rally
her
exhausted
spirits
and
arthur
try
and
become
a
new
man
of
course
laura
would
not
forsake
her
mother
of
course
not
it
was
about
helen
and
helen
only
that
is
about
arthur
too
for
her
sake
that
laura
was
anxious
she
would
go
abroad
or
anywhere
with
helen
and
helen
having
thought
the
matter
over
for
an
hour
in
her
room
had
by
that
time
grown
to
be
as
anxious
for
the
tour
as
any
schoolboy
who
has
been
reading
a
book
of
voyages
is
eager
to
go
to
sea
whither
should
they
go
the
farther
the
better
to
some
place
so
remote
that
even
recollection
could
not
follow
them
thither
so
delightful
that
pen
should
never
want
to
leave
it
anywhere
so
that
he
could
be
happy
she
opened
her
desk
with
trembling
fingers
and
took
out
her
banker
book
and
counted
up
her
little
savings
if
more
was
wanted
she
had
the
diamond
cross
she
would
borrow
from
laura
again
let
us
go
let
us
go
she
thought
directly
he
can
bear
the
journey
let
us
go
away
come
kind
doctor
goodenough
come
quick
and
give
us
leave
to
quit
the
good
doctor
drove
over
to
dine
with
them
that
very
day
if
you
agitate
yourself
so
he
said
to
her
and
if
your
heart
beats
so
and
if
you
persist
in
being
so
anxious
about
a
young
gentleman
who
is
getting
well
as
fast
as
he
can
we
shall
have
you
laid
up
and
miss
laura
to
watch
you
and
then
it
will
be
her
turn
to
be
ill
and
i
should
like
to
know
how
the
deuce
a
doctor
is
to
live
who
is
obliged
to
come
and
attend
you
all
for
nothing
goodenough
is
already
jealous
of
you
and
says
with
perfect
justice
that
i
fall
in
love
with
my
patients
and
you
must
please
to
get
out
of
the
country
as
soon
as
ever
you
can
that
i
may
have
a
little
peace
in
my
when
the
plan
of
going
abroad
was
proposed
it
was
received
by
that
gentleman
with
the
greatest
alacrity
and
enthusiasm
he
longed
to
be
off
at
once
he
let
his
mustachios
grow
from
that
very
moment
in
order
i
suppose
that
he
might
get
his
mouth
into
training
for
a
perfect
french
and
german
pronunciation
and
he
was
seriously
disquieted
in
his
mind
because
the
mustachios
when
they
came
were
of
a
decidedly
red
colour
he
had
looked
forward
to
an
autumn
at
fairoaks
and
perhaps
the
idea
of
passing
two
or
three
months
there
did
not
amuse
the
young
man
there
is
not
a
soul
to
speak
to
in
the
place
he
said
to
warrington
i
stand
old
portman
sermons
and
pompous
conversation
i
know
all
old
glanders
stories
about
the
peninsular
war
the
claverings
are
the
only
christian
people
in
the
neighbourhood
and
they
are
not
to
be
at
home
before
christmas
my
uncle
says
besides
warrington
i
want
to
get
out
of
the
country
whilst
you
were
away
confound
it
i
had
a
temptation
from
which
i
am
very
thankful
to
have
escaped
and
which
i
count
that
even
my
illness
came
very
luckily
to
put
an
end
and
here
he
narrated
to
his
friend
the
circumstances
of
the
vauxhall
affair
with
which
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
warrington
looked
very
grave
when
he
heard
this
story
putting
the
moral
delinquency
out
of
the
question
he
was
extremely
glad
for
sake
that
the
latter
had
escaped
from
a
danger
which
might
have
made
his
whole
life
wretched
which
certainly
said
warrington
would
have
occasioned
the
wretchedness
and
ruin
of
the
other
party
and
your
mother
and
and
your
friends
what
a
pain
it
would
have
been
to
them
urged
pen
companion
little
knowing
what
grief
and
annoyance
these
good
people
had
already
suffered
not
a
word
to
my
mother
pen
cried
out
in
a
state
of
great
alarm
she
would
never
get
over
it
an
esclandre
of
that
sort
would
kill
her
i
do
believe
and
he
added
with
a
knowing
air
and
as
if
like
a
young
rascal
of
a
lovelace
he
had
been
engaged
in
what
are
called
affaires
de
coeur
all
his
life
the
best
way
when
a
danger
of
that
sort
menaces
is
not
to
face
it
but
to
turn
one
back
on
it
and
and
were
you
very
much
smitten
warrington
asked
hm
said
lovelace
she
dropped
her
h
but
she
was
a
dear
little
o
clarissas
of
this
life
o
you
poor
little
ignorant
vain
foolish
maidens
if
you
did
but
know
the
way
in
which
the
lovelaces
speak
of
you
if
you
could
but
hear
jack
talking
to
tom
across
the
of
a
club
or
see
ned
taking
your
poor
little
letters
out
of
his
and
handing
them
over
to
charley
and
billy
and
harry
across
the
messroom
table
you
would
not
be
so
eager
to
write
or
so
ready
to
listen
there
a
sort
of
crime
which
is
not
complete
unless
the
lucky
rogue
boasts
of
it
afterwards
and
the
man
who
betrays
your
honour
in
the
first
place
is
pretty
sure
remember
that
to
betray
your
secret
too
it
hard
to
fight
and
it
easy
to
fall
said
warring
gloomily
and
as
you
say
pendennis
when
a
danger
like
this
is
imminent
the
best
way
is
to
turn
your
back
on
it
and
after
this
little
discourse
upon
a
subject
about
which
pen
would
have
talked
a
great
deal
more
eloquently
a
month
back
the
conversation
reverted
to
the
plans
for
going
abroad
and
arthur
eagerly
pressed
his
friend
to
be
of
the
party
warrington
was
a
part
of
the
family
a
part
of
the
cure
arthur
said
he
should
not
have
half
the
pleasure
without
warrington
but
george
said
no
he
could
go
he
must
stop
at
home
and
take
place
the
other
remarked
that
that
was
needless
for
shandon
was
now
come
back
to
london
and
arthur
was
entitled
to
a
holiday
do
press
me
warrington
said
i
ca
go
i
particular
engagements
i
best
at
home
i
not
got
the
money
to
travel
the
long
and
short
of
it
for
travelling
costs
money
you
this
little
obstacle
seemed
fatal
to
pen
he
mentioned
it
to
his
mother
pendennis
was
very
sorry
warrington
had
been
exceedingly
kind
but
she
supposed
he
knew
best
about
his
affairs
and
then
no
doubt
she
reproached
herself
for
selfishness
in
wishing
to
carry
the
boy
off
and
have
him
to
herself
altogether
what
is
this
i
hear
from
pen
my
dear
warrington
the
major
asked
one
day
when
the
pair
were
alone
and
after
warrington
objection
had
been
stated
to
him
not
go
with
us
we
ca
hear
of
such
a
thing
pen
wo
get
well
without
you
i
promise
you
i
not
going
to
be
his
nurse
he
must
have
somebody
with
him
that
stronger
and
gayer
and
better
able
to
amuse
him
than
a
rheumatic
old
fogy
like
me
i
shall
go
to
carlsbad
very
likely
when
i
seen
you
people
settle
down
travelling
costs
nothing
nowadays
or
so
little
and
and
pray
warrington
remember
that
i
was
your
father
very
old
friend
and
if
you
and
your
brother
are
not
on
such
terms
as
to
to
enable
you
to
to
anticipate
your
younger
brother
allowance
i
beg
you
to
make
me
your
banker
for
has
pen
been
getting
into
your
debt
these
three
weeks
past
during
which
you
have
been
doing
what
he
informs
me
is
his
work
with
such
exemplary
talent
and
genius
begad
still
in
spite
of
this
kind
offer
and
generosity
on
the
part
of
the
major
george
warrington
refused
and
said
he
would
stay
at
home
but
it
was
with
a
faltering
voice
and
an
irresolute
accent
which
showed
how
much
he
would
like
to
go
though
his
tongue
persisted
in
saying
nay
but
the
major
persevering
benevolence
was
not
to
be
baulked
in
this
way
at
the
that
evening
helen
happening
to
be
absent
from
the
room
for
the
moment
looking
for
pen
who
had
gone
to
roost
old
pendennis
returned
to
the
charge
and
rated
warrington
for
refusing
to
join
in
their
excursion
is
it
ungallant
miss
bell
he
said
turning
to
that
young
lady
is
it
unfriendly
here
we
have
been
the
happiest
party
in
the
world
and
this
odious
selfish
creature
breaks
it
up
miss
bell
long
eyelashes
looked
down
towards
her
teacup
and
warrington
blushed
hugely
but
did
not
speak
neither
did
miss
bell
speak
but
when
he
blushed
she
blushed
too
you
ask
him
to
come
my
dear
said
the
benevolent
old
gentleman
and
then
perhaps
he
will
listen
to
you
why
should
warrington
listen
to
me
asked
the
young
lady
putting
the
query
to
her
teaspoon
seemingly
and
not
to
the
major
ask
him
you
have
not
asked
him
said
pen
artless
uncle
i
should
be
very
glad
indeed
if
warrington
would
come
remarked
laura
to
the
teaspoon
would
you
said
george
she
looked
up
and
said
their
eyes
met
i
will
go
anywhere
you
ask
me
or
do
anything
said
george
lowly
and
forcing
out
the
words
as
if
they
gave
him
pain
old
pendennis
was
delighted
the
affectionate
old
creature
clapped
his
hands
and
cried
bravo
bravo
it
a
bargain
a
bargain
begad
shake
hands
on
it
young
people
and
laura
with
a
look
full
of
tender
brightness
put
out
her
hand
to
warrington
he
took
hers
his
face
indicated
a
strange
agitation
he
seemed
to
be
about
to
speak
when
from
pen
neighbouring
room
helen
entered
looking
at
them
as
the
candle
which
she
held
lighted
her
pale
frightened
face
laura
blushed
more
red
than
ever
and
withdrew
her
hand
what
is
it
helen
asked
it
a
bargain
we
have
been
making
my
dear
creature
said
the
major
in
his
most
caressing
voice
we
have
just
bound
over
warrington
in
a
promise
to
come
abroad
with
indeed
helen
said
chapter
lvi
in
which
fanny
engages
a
new
medical
man
could
helen
have
suspected
that
with
pen
returning
strength
his
unhappy
partiality
for
little
fanny
would
also
reawaken
though
she
never
spoke
a
word
regarding
that
young
person
after
her
conversation
with
the
major
and
though
to
all
appearances
she
utterly
ignored
fanny
existence
yet
pendennis
kept
a
particularly
close
watch
upon
all
master
arthur
actions
on
the
plea
of
would
scarcely
let
him
out
of
her
sight
and
was
especially
anxious
that
he
should
be
spared
the
trouble
of
all
correspondence
for
the
present
at
least
very
likely
arthur
looked
at
his
own
letters
with
some
tremor
very
likely
as
he
received
them
at
the
family
table
feeling
his
mother
watch
upon
him
though
the
good
soul
eye
seemed
fixed
upon
her
teacup
or
her
book
he
expected
daily
to
see
a
little
handwriting
which
he
would
have
known
though
he
had
never
seen
it
yet
and
his
heart
beat
as
he
received
the
letters
to
his
address
was
he
more
pleased
or
annoyed
that
day
after
day
his
expectations
were
not
realised
and
was
his
mind
relieved
that
there
came
no
letter
from
fanny
though
no
doubt
in
these
matters
when
lovelace
is
tired
of
clarissa
or
the
contrary
it
is
best
for
both
parties
to
break
at
once
and
each
after
the
failure
of
the
attempt
at
union
to
go
his
own
way
and
pursue
his
course
through
life
solitary
yet
our
or
our
pity
or
our
sense
of
decency
does
not
like
that
sudden
bankruptcy
before
we
announce
to
the
world
that
our
firm
of
lovelace
and
meet
its
engagements
we
try
to
make
compromises
we
have
mournful
meetings
of
partners
we
delay
the
putting
up
of
the
shutters
and
the
dreary
announcement
of
the
failure
it
must
come
but
we
pawn
our
jewels
to
keep
things
going
a
little
longer
on
the
whole
i
dare
say
pen
was
rather
annoyed
that
he
had
no
remonstrances
from
fanny
what
could
she
part
from
him
and
never
so
much
as
once
look
round
could
she
sink
and
never
once
hold
a
little
hand
out
or
cry
help
arthur
well
well
they
do
all
go
down
who
venture
on
that
voyage
some
few
drown
when
the
vessel
founders
but
most
are
only
ducked
and
scramble
to
shore
and
the
reader
experience
of
pendennis
esquire
of
the
upper
temple
will
enable
him
to
state
whether
that
gentleman
belonged
to
the
class
of
persons
who
were
likely
to
sink
or
to
swim
though
pen
was
as
yet
too
weak
to
walk
half
a
mile
and
might
not
on
account
of
his
precious
health
be
trusted
to
take
a
drive
in
a
carriage
by
himself
and
without
a
nurse
in
attendance
yet
helen
could
not
keep
watch
over
warrington
too
and
had
no
authority
to
prevent
that
gentleman
from
going
to
london
if
business
called
him
thither
indeed
if
he
had
gone
and
stayed
perhaps
the
widow
from
reasons
of
her
own
would
have
been
glad
but
she
checked
these
selfish
wishes
as
soon
as
she
ascertained
or
owned
them
and
remembering
warrington
great
regard
and
services
and
constant
friendship
for
her
boy
received
him
as
a
member
of
her
family
almost
with
her
usual
melancholy
kindness
and
submissive
acquiescence
yet
somehow
one
morning
when
his
affairs
called
him
to
town
she
divined
what
warrington
errand
was
and
that
he
was
gone
to
london
to
get
news
about
fanny
for
pen
indeed
arthur
had
had
some
talk
with
his
friend
and
told
him
more
at
large
what
his
adventures
had
been
with
fanny
adventures
which
the
reader
knows
already
and
what
were
his
feelings
respecting
her
he
was
very
thankful
that
he
had
escaped
the
great
danger
to
which
warrington
said
amen
heartily
that
he
had
no
great
fault
wherewith
to
reproach
himself
in
regard
of
his
behaviour
to
her
but
that
if
they
parted
as
they
must
he
would
be
glad
to
say
a
god
bless
her
and
to
hope
that
she
would
remember
him
kindly
in
his
discourse
with
warrington
he
spoke
upon
these
matters
with
so
much
gravity
and
so
much
emotion
that
george
who
had
pronounced
himself
most
strongly
for
the
separation
too
began
to
fear
that
his
friend
was
not
so
well
cured
as
he
boasted
of
being
and
that
if
the
two
were
to
come
together
again
all
the
danger
and
the
temptation
might
have
to
be
fought
once
more
and
with
what
result
it
is
hard
to
struggle
arthur
and
it
is
easy
to
fall
warrington
said
and
the
best
courage
for
us
poor
wretches
is
to
fly
from
danger
i
would
not
have
been
what
i
am
now
had
i
practised
what
i
preach
and
what
did
you
practise
george
pen
asked
eagerly
i
knew
there
was
something
tell
us
about
it
there
was
something
that
ca
be
mended
and
that
shattered
my
whole
fortunes
early
warrington
answered
i
said
i
would
tell
you
about
it
some
day
pen
and
will
but
not
now
take
the
moral
without
the
fable
now
pen
my
boy
and
if
you
want
to
see
a
man
whose
whole
life
has
been
wrecked
by
an
unlucky
rock
against
which
he
struck
as
a
boy
here
he
is
arthur
and
so
i
warn
we
have
shown
how
huxter
in
writing
home
to
his
clavering
friends
mentioned
that
there
was
a
fashionable
club
in
london
of
which
he
was
an
attendant
and
that
he
was
there
in
the
habit
of
meeting
an
irish
officer
of
distinction
who
amongst
other
news
had
given
that
intelligence
regarding
pendennis
which
the
young
surgeon
had
transmitted
to
clavering
this
club
was
no
other
than
the
back
kitchen
where
the
disciple
of
saint
bartholomew
was
accustomed
to
meet
the
general
the
peculiarities
of
whose
brogue
appearance
disposition
and
general
conversation
greatly
diverted
many
young
gentlemen
who
used
the
back
kitchen
as
a
place
of
nightly
entertainment
and
refreshment
huxter
who
had
a
fine
natural
genius
for
mimicking
everything
whether
it
was
a
favourite
tragic
or
comic
actor
or
a
cock
on
a
dunghill
a
corkscrew
going
into
a
bottle
and
a
cork
issuing
thence
or
an
irish
officer
of
genteel
connexions
who
offered
himself
as
an
object
of
imitation
with
only
too
much
readiness
talked
his
talk
and
twanged
his
poor
old
long
bow
whenever
drink
a
hearer
and
an
opportunity
occurred
studied
our
friend
the
general
with
peculiar
gusto
and
drew
the
honest
fellow
out
many
a
night
a
bait
consisting
of
sixpennyworth
of
the
worthy
old
man
was
sure
to
swallow
and
under
the
influence
of
this
liquor
who
was
more
happy
than
he
to
tell
his
stories
of
his
daughter
triumphs
and
his
own
in
love
war
drink
and
polite
society
thus
huxter
was
enabled
to
present
to
his
friends
many
pictures
of
costigan
of
costigan
fighting
a
jewel
in
the
phaynix
of
costigan
and
his
interview
with
the
juke
of
york
of
costigan
at
his
teeble
surrounded
by
the
nobilitee
of
his
countree
of
costigan
when
crying
drunk
at
which
time
he
was
in
the
habit
of
confidentially
lamenting
his
daughter
ingratichewd
and
stating
that
his
grey
hairs
were
hastening
to
a
praymachure
greeve
and
thus
our
friend
was
the
means
of
bringing
a
number
of
young
fellows
to
the
back
kitchen
who
consumed
the
landlord
liquors
whilst
they
relished
the
peculiarities
so
that
mine
host
pardoned
many
of
the
latter
foibles
in
consideration
of
the
good
which
they
brought
to
his
house
not
the
highest
position
in
life
was
this
certainly
or
one
which
if
we
had
a
reverence
for
an
old
man
we
would
be
anxious
that
he
should
occupy
but
of
this
aged
buffoon
it
may
be
mentioned
that
he
had
no
particular
idea
that
his
condition
of
life
was
not
a
high
one
and
that
in
his
whiskied
blood
there
was
not
a
black
drop
nor
in
his
muddled
brains
a
bitter
feeling
against
any
mortal
being
even
his
child
his
cruel
emily
he
would
have
taken
to
his
heart
and
forgiven
with
tears
and
what
more
can
one
say
of
the
christian
charity
of
a
man
than
that
he
is
actually
ready
to
forgive
those
who
have
done
him
every
kindness
and
with
whom
he
is
wrong
in
a
dispute
there
was
some
idea
amongst
the
young
men
who
frequented
the
back
kitchen
and
made
themselves
merry
with
the
society
of
captain
costigan
that
the
captain
made
a
mystery
regarding
his
lodgings
for
fear
of
duns
or
from
a
desire
of
privacy
and
lived
in
some
wonderful
place
nor
would
the
landlord
of
the
premises
when
questioned
upon
this
subject
answer
any
inquiries
his
maxim
being
that
he
only
knew
gentlemen
who
frequented
that
room
in
that
room
that
when
they
quitted
that
room
having
paid
their
scores
as
gentlemen
and
behaved
as
gentlemen
his
communication
with
them
ceased
and
that
as
a
gentleman
himself
he
thought
it
was
only
impertinent
curiosity
to
ask
where
any
other
gentleman
lived
costigan
in
his
most
intoxicated
and
confidential
moments
also
evaded
any
replies
to
questions
or
hints
addressed
to
him
on
this
subject
there
was
no
particular
secret
about
it
as
we
have
seen
who
have
had
more
than
once
the
honour
of
entering
his
apartments
but
in
the
vicissitudes
of
a
long
life
he
had
been
pretty
often
in
the
habit
of
residing
in
houses
where
privacy
was
necessary
to
his
comfort
and
where
the
appearance
of
some
visitors
would
have
brought
him
anything
but
pleasure
hence
all
sorts
of
legends
were
formed
by
wags
or
credulous
persons
respecting
his
place
of
abode
it
was
stated
that
he
slept
habitually
in
a
in
the
city
in
a
cab
at
a
mews
where
a
gave
him
a
shelter
in
the
duke
of
york
column
etc
the
wildest
of
these
theories
being
put
abroad
by
the
facetious
and
imaginative
huxter
for
huxey
when
not
silenced
by
the
company
of
swells
and
when
in
the
society
of
his
own
friends
was
a
very
different
fellow
to
the
youth
whom
we
have
seen
cowed
by
impertinent
airs
and
adored
by
his
family
at
home
was
the
life
and
soul
of
the
circle
whom
he
met
either
round
the
festive
board
or
the
dissecting
table
on
one
brilliant
september
morning
as
huxter
was
regaling
himself
with
a
cup
of
coffee
at
a
stall
in
covent
garden
having
spent
a
delicious
night
dancing
at
vauxhall
he
spied
the
general
reeling
down
henrietta
street
with
a
crowd
of
hooting
blackguard
boys
at
his
heels
who
had
left
their
beds
under
the
arches
of
the
river
betimes
and
were
prowling
about
already
for
breakfast
and
the
strange
livelihood
of
the
day
the
poor
old
general
was
not
in
that
condition
when
the
sneers
and
jokes
of
these
young
beggars
had
much
effect
upon
him
the
cabmen
and
watermen
at
the
cabstand
knew
him
and
passed
their
comments
upon
him
the
policemen
gazed
after
him
and
warned
the
boys
off
him
with
looks
of
scorn
and
pity
what
did
the
scorn
and
pity
of
men
the
jokes
of
ribald
children
matter
to
the
general
he
reeled
along
the
street
with
glazed
eyes
having
just
sense
enough
to
know
whither
he
was
bound
and
to
pursue
his
accustomed
beat
homewards
he
went
to
bed
not
knowing
how
he
had
reached
it
as
often
as
any
man
in
london
he
woke
and
found
himself
there
and
asked
no
questions
and
he
was
tacking
about
on
this
daily
though
perilous
voyage
when
from
his
station
at
the
huxter
spied
him
to
note
his
friend
to
pay
his
twopence
indeed
he
had
but
eightpence
left
or
he
would
have
had
a
cab
from
vauxhall
to
take
him
home
was
with
the
eager
huxter
the
work
of
an
instant
costigan
dived
down
the
alleys
by
drury
lane
theatre
where
and
theatrical
wardrobes
abound
the
proprietors
of
which
were
now
asleep
behind
their
shutters
as
the
pink
morning
lighted
up
their
chimneys
and
through
these
courts
huxter
followed
the
general
until
he
reached
oldcastle
street
in
which
is
the
gate
of
shepherd
inn
here
just
as
he
was
within
sight
of
home
a
luckless
slice
of
came
between
the
general
heel
and
the
pavement
and
caused
the
poor
old
fellow
to
fall
backwards
huxter
ran
up
to
him
instantly
and
after
a
pause
during
which
the
veteran
giddy
with
his
fall
and
his
previous
whisky
gathered
as
he
best
might
his
dizzy
brains
together
the
young
surgeon
lifted
up
the
limping
general
and
very
kindly
and
offered
to
conduct
him
to
his
home
for
some
time
and
in
reply
to
the
queries
which
the
student
of
medicine
put
to
him
the
muzzy
general
refused
to
say
where
his
lodgings
were
and
declared
that
they
were
hard
by
and
that
he
could
reach
them
without
difficulty
and
he
disengaged
himself
from
arm
and
made
a
rush
as
if
to
get
to
his
own
home
unattended
but
he
reeled
and
lurched
so
that
the
young
surgeon
insisted
upon
accompanying
him
and
with
many
soothing
expressions
and
cheering
and
consolatory
phrases
succeeded
in
getting
the
general
dirty
old
hand
under
what
he
called
his
own
fin
and
led
the
old
fellow
moaning
piteously
across
the
street
he
stopped
when
he
came
to
the
ancient
gate
ornamented
with
the
armorial
bearings
of
the
venerable
shepherd
here
is
said
he
drawing
up
at
the
portal
and
he
made
a
successful
pull
at
the
gate
bell
which
presently
brought
out
old
bolton
the
porter
scowling
fiercely
and
grumbling
as
he
was
used
to
do
every
morning
when
it
became
his
turn
to
let
in
that
early
bird
costigan
tried
to
hold
bolton
for
a
moment
in
genteel
conversation
but
the
other
surlily
would
not
do
bother
me
said
he
go
to
your
hown
bed
capting
and
do
keep
honest
men
out
of
so
the
captain
tacked
across
the
square
and
reached
his
own
staircase
up
which
he
stumbled
with
the
worthy
huxter
at
his
heels
costigan
had
a
key
of
his
own
which
huxter
inserted
into
the
keyhole
for
him
so
that
there
was
no
need
to
call
up
little
bows
from
the
sleep
into
which
the
old
musician
had
not
long
since
fallen
and
huxter
having
aided
to
disrobe
his
tipsy
patient
and
ascertained
that
no
bones
were
broken
helped
him
to
bed
and
applied
compresses
an
water
to
one
of
his
knees
and
shins
which
with
the
pair
of
trousers
which
encased
them
costigan
had
severely
torn
in
his
fall
at
the
general
age
and
with
his
habit
of
body
such
wounds
as
he
had
inflicted
on
himself
are
slow
to
heal
a
good
deal
of
inflammation
ensued
and
the
old
fellow
lay
ill
for
some
days
suffering
both
pain
and
fever
huxter
undertook
the
case
of
his
interesting
patient
with
great
confidence
and
alacrity
and
conducted
it
with
becoming
skill
he
visited
his
friend
day
after
day
and
consoled
him
with
lively
rattle
and
conversation
for
the
absence
of
the
society
which
costigan
needed
and
of
which
he
was
an
ornament
and
he
gave
special
instructions
to
the
invalid
nurse
about
the
quantity
of
whisky
which
the
patient
was
to
take
instructions
which
as
the
poor
old
fellow
could
not
for
many
days
get
out
of
his
bed
or
sofa
himself
he
could
not
by
any
means
infringe
bows
bolton
and
our
little
friend
fanny
when
able
to
do
so
officiated
at
the
general
bedside
and
the
old
warrior
was
made
as
comfortable
as
possible
under
his
calamity
thus
huxter
whose
affable
manners
and
social
turn
made
him
quickly
intimate
with
persons
in
whose
society
he
fell
and
whose
did
not
lead
them
to
repulse
the
familiarities
of
this
young
gentleman
became
pretty
soon
intimate
in
shepherd
inn
both
with
our
acquaintances
in
the
garrets
and
those
in
the
porter
lodge
he
thought
he
had
seen
fanny
somewhere
he
felt
certain
that
he
had
but
it
is
no
wonder
that
he
should
not
accurately
remember
her
for
the
poor
little
thing
never
chose
to
tell
him
where
she
had
met
him
he
himself
had
seen
her
at
a
period
when
his
own
views
both
of
persons
and
of
right
and
wrong
were
clouded
by
the
excitement
of
drinking
and
dancing
and
also
little
fanny
was
very
much
changed
and
worn
by
the
fever
and
agitation
and
passion
and
despair
which
the
past
three
weeks
had
poured
upon
the
head
of
that
little
victim
borne
down
was
the
head
now
and
very
pale
and
wan
the
face
and
many
and
many
a
time
the
sad
eyes
had
looked
into
the
postman
as
he
came
to
the
inn
and
the
sickened
heart
had
sunk
as
he
passed
away
when
costigan
accident
occurred
fanny
was
rather
glad
to
have
an
opportunity
of
being
useful
and
doing
something
kind
something
that
would
make
her
forget
her
own
little
sorrows
perhaps
she
felt
she
bore
them
better
whilst
she
did
her
duty
though
i
dare
say
many
a
tear
dropped
into
the
old
irishman
gruel
ah
me
stir
the
gruel
well
and
have
courage
little
fanny
if
everybody
who
has
suffered
from
your
complaint
were
to
die
of
it
straightway
what
a
fine
year
the
undertakers
would
have
whether
from
compassion
for
his
only
patient
or
delight
in
his
society
huxter
found
now
occasion
to
visit
costigan
two
or
three
times
in
the
day
at
least
and
if
any
of
the
members
of
the
porter
lodge
family
were
not
in
attendance
on
the
general
the
young
doctor
was
sure
to
have
some
particular
directions
to
address
to
those
at
their
own
place
of
habitation
he
was
a
kind
fellow
he
made
or
purchased
toys
for
the
children
he
brought
them
apples
and
he
brought
a
mask
and
frightened
them
with
it
and
caused
a
smile
upon
the
face
of
pale
fanny
he
called
bolton
and
was
very
intimate
familiar
and
facetious
with
that
lady
quite
different
from
that
aughty
artless
beast
as
bolton
now
denominated
a
certain
young
gentleman
of
our
acquaintance
and
whom
she
now
vowed
she
never
could
abear
it
was
from
this
lady
who
was
very
free
in
her
conversation
that
huxter
presently
learnt
what
was
the
illness
which
was
evidently
preying
upon
little
fan
and
what
had
been
pen
behaviour
regarding
her
bolton
account
of
the
transaction
was
not
it
may
be
imagined
entirely
an
impartial
narrative
one
would
have
thought
from
her
story
that
the
young
gentleman
had
employed
a
course
of
the
most
persevering
and
flagitious
artifices
to
win
the
girl
heart
had
broken
the
most
solemn
promises
made
to
her
and
was
a
wretch
to
be
hated
and
chastised
by
every
champion
of
woman
huxter
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
respecting
arthur
and
suffering
under
the
latter
contumely
was
ready
of
course
to
take
all
for
granted
that
was
said
in
the
disfavour
of
this
unfortunate
convalescent
but
why
did
he
not
write
home
to
clavering
as
he
had
done
previously
giving
an
account
of
misconduct
and
of
the
particulars
regarding
it
which
had
now
come
to
his
knowledge
he
soon
in
a
letter
to
his
announced
that
that
nice
young
man
pendennis
had
escaped
narrowly
from
a
fever
and
that
no
doubt
all
clavering
where
he
was
so
popular
would
be
pleased
at
his
recovery
and
he
mentioned
that
he
had
an
interesting
case
of
compound
fracture
an
officer
of
distinction
which
kept
him
in
town
but
as
for
fanny
bolton
he
made
no
more
mention
of
her
in
his
letters
no
more
than
pen
himself
had
made
mention
of
her
o
you
mothers
at
home
how
much
do
you
think
you
know
about
your
lads
how
much
do
you
think
you
know
but
with
bows
there
was
no
reason
why
huxter
should
not
speak
his
mind
and
so
a
very
short
time
after
his
conversation
with
bolton
sam
talked
to
the
musician
about
his
early
acquaintance
with
pendennis
described
him
as
a
confounded
conceited
blackguard
and
expressed
a
determination
to
punch
his
impudent
head
as
soon
as
ever
he
should
be
well
enough
to
stand
up
like
a
man
then
it
was
that
bows
on
his
part
spoke
and
told
his
version
of
the
story
whereof
arthur
and
little
fan
were
the
hero
and
heroine
how
they
had
met
by
no
contrivance
of
the
former
but
by
a
blunder
of
the
old
irishman
now
in
bed
with
a
broken
shin
how
pen
had
acted
with
manliness
and
in
the
business
how
mrs
bolton
was
an
idiot
and
he
related
the
conversation
which
he
bows
had
had
with
pen
and
the
sentiments
uttered
by
the
young
man
perhaps
bow
story
caused
some
twinges
of
conscience
in
the
breast
of
pen
accuser
and
that
gentleman
frankly
owned
that
he
had
been
wrong
with
regard
to
arthur
and
withdrew
his
project
for
punching
pendennis
head
but
the
cessation
of
his
hostility
for
pen
did
not
diminish
attentions
to
fanny
which
unlucky
mr
bows
marked
with
his
usual
jealousy
and
bitterness
of
spirit
i
have
but
to
like
anybody
the
old
fellow
thought
and
somebody
is
sure
to
come
and
be
preferred
to
me
it
has
been
the
same
with
me
since
i
was
a
lad
until
now
that
i
am
sixty
years
old
what
can
such
a
man
as
i
am
expect
better
than
to
be
laughed
at
it
is
for
the
young
to
succeed
and
to
be
happy
and
not
for
old
fools
like
me
i
played
a
second
fiddle
through
life
he
said
with
a
bitter
laugh
how
can
i
suppose
the
luck
is
to
change
after
it
has
gone
against
me
so
long
this
was
the
selfish
way
in
which
bows
looked
at
the
state
of
affairs
though
few
persons
would
have
thought
there
was
any
cause
for
his
jealousy
who
looked
at
the
pale
and
countenance
of
the
hapless
little
girl
its
object
fanny
received
huxter
efforts
at
consolation
and
kind
attentions
kindly
she
laughed
now
and
again
at
his
jokes
and
games
with
her
little
sisters
but
relapsed
quickly
into
a
dejection
which
ought
to
have
satisfied
bows
that
the
had
no
place
in
her
heart
as
yet
had
jealous
bows
been
enabled
to
see
with
clear
eyes
but
bows
did
not
fanny
attributed
pen
silence
somehow
to
interference
fanny
hated
him
fanny
treated
bows
with
constant
cruelty
and
injustice
she
turned
from
him
when
he
spoke
she
loathed
his
attempts
at
consolation
a
hard
life
had
bows
and
a
cruel
return
for
his
regard
when
warrington
came
to
shepherd
inn
as
pen
ambassador
it
was
for
bows
apartments
he
inquired
no
doubt
upon
a
previous
agreement
with
the
principal
for
whom
he
acted
in
this
delicate
negotiation
and
he
did
not
so
much
as
catch
a
glimpse
of
miss
fanny
when
he
stopped
at
the
and
made
his
inquiry
warrington
was
of
course
directed
to
the
musician
chambers
and
found
him
tending
the
patient
there
from
whose
chamber
he
came
out
to
wait
upon
his
guest
we
have
said
that
they
had
been
previously
known
to
one
another
and
the
pair
shook
hands
with
sufficient
cordiality
after
a
little
preliminary
talk
warrington
said
that
he
had
come
from
his
friend
arthur
pendennis
and
from
his
family
to
thank
bows
for
his
attention
at
the
commencement
of
illness
and
for
his
kindness
in
hastening
into
the
country
to
fetch
the
major
bows
replied
that
it
was
but
his
duty
he
had
never
thought
to
have
seen
the
young
gentleman
alive
again
when
he
went
in
search
of
relatives
and
he
was
very
glad
of
pendennis
recovery
and
that
he
had
his
friends
with
him
lucky
are
they
who
have
friends
warrington
said
the
musician
i
might
be
up
in
this
garret
and
nobody
would
care
for
me
or
mind
whether
i
was
alive
or
what
not
the
general
bows
warrington
asked
the
general
likes
his
more
than
anything
in
life
the
other
answered
we
live
together
from
habit
and
convenience
and
he
cares
for
me
no
more
than
you
do
what
is
it
you
want
to
ask
me
warrington
you
ai
come
to
visit
me
i
know
very
well
nobody
comes
to
visit
me
it
is
about
fanny
the
porter
daughter
you
are
come
i
see
that
very
well
is
pendennis
now
he
has
got
well
anxious
to
see
her
again
does
his
lordship
the
sultan
propose
to
throw
his
to
her
she
has
been
very
ill
sir
ever
since
the
day
when
pendennis
turned
her
out
of
doors
kind
of
a
lady
was
it
the
poor
girl
and
myself
found
the
young
gentleman
raving
in
a
fever
knowing
nobody
with
nobody
to
tend
him
but
his
drunken
laundress
she
watched
day
and
night
by
him
i
set
off
to
fetch
his
uncle
mamma
comes
and
turns
fanny
to
the
uncle
comes
and
leaves
me
to
pay
the
cab
carry
my
compliments
to
the
ladies
and
gentleman
and
say
we
are
both
very
thankful
very
why
a
countess
could
have
behaved
better
and
for
an
apothecary
lady
as
i
given
to
understand
pendennis
was
i
sure
her
behaviour
is
most
uncommon
aristocratic
and
genteel
she
ought
to
have
a
pestle
and
mortar
to
her
it
was
from
huxter
that
bows
had
learned
pen
parentage
no
doubt
and
if
he
took
pen
part
against
the
young
surgeon
and
fanny
against
pendennis
it
was
because
the
old
gentleman
was
in
so
savage
a
mood
that
his
humour
was
to
contradict
everybody
warrington
was
curious
and
not
ill
pleased
at
the
musician
taunts
and
irascibility
i
never
heard
of
these
transactions
he
said
or
got
but
a
very
imperfect
account
of
them
from
major
pendennis
what
was
a
lady
to
do
i
think
i
have
never
spoken
with
her
on
the
subject
she
had
some
notion
that
the
young
woman
and
my
friend
pen
were
on
on
terms
of
of
an
intimacy
which
pendennis
could
not
of
course
recognise
oh
of
course
not
sir
speak
out
sir
say
what
you
mean
at
once
that
the
young
gentleman
of
the
temple
had
made
a
victim
of
the
girl
of
shepherd
inn
eh
and
so
she
was
turned
to
be
out
of
doors
or
brayed
alive
in
the
pestle
and
mortar
by
jove
no
warrington
there
was
no
such
thing
there
was
no
victimising
or
if
there
was
arthur
was
the
victim
not
the
girl
he
is
an
honest
fellow
he
is
though
he
is
conceited
and
a
puppy
sometimes
he
can
feel
like
a
man
and
run
away
from
temptation
like
a
man
i
own
it
though
i
suffer
by
it
i
own
it
he
has
a
heart
he
has
but
the
girl
has
sir
that
girl
will
do
anything
to
win
a
man
and
fling
him
away
without
a
pang
sir
if
she
flung
away
herself
sir
she
feel
it
and
cry
she
had
a
fever
when
pendennis
turned
her
out
of
doors
and
she
made
love
to
the
doctor
doctor
goodenough
who
came
to
cure
her
now
she
has
taken
on
with
another
chap
another
sawbones
ha
ha
d
it
sir
she
likes
the
pestle
and
mortar
and
hangs
round
the
she
so
fond
of
and
she
has
got
a
fellow
from
saint
bartholomew
who
grins
through
a
for
her
sisters
and
charms
away
her
melancholy
go
and
see
sir
very
likely
he
in
the
lodge
now
if
you
want
news
about
miss
fanny
you
must
ask
at
the
doctor
shop
sir
not
of
an
old
fiddler
like
me
sir
there
my
patient
and
a
voice
was
heard
from
the
captain
bedroom
a
voice
which
said
i
loike
a
dthrop
of
dthrink
bows
i
and
not
sorry
perhaps
to
hear
that
such
was
the
state
of
things
and
that
pen
forsaken
was
consoling
herself
warrington
took
his
leave
of
the
irascible
musician
as
luck
would
have
it
he
passed
the
lodge
door
just
as
huxter
was
in
the
act
of
frightening
the
children
with
the
mask
whereof
we
have
spoken
and
fanny
was
smiling
languidly
at
his
farces
warrington
laughed
bitterly
are
all
women
like
that
he
thought
i
think
there
one
that
not
he
added
with
a
sigh
at
piccadilly
waiting
for
the
richmond
omnibus
george
fell
in
with
major
pendennis
bound
in
the
same
direction
and
he
told
the
old
gentleman
of
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
respecting
fanny
major
pendennis
was
highly
delighted
and
as
might
be
expected
of
such
a
philosopher
made
precisely
the
same
observation
as
that
which
had
escaped
from
warrington
all
women
are
the
same
he
said
la
petite
se
console
daymy
when
i
used
to
read
at
school
calypso
ne
pouvait
se
consoler
you
know
the
rest
warrington
i
used
to
say
it
was
absard
absard
by
gad
and
so
it
is
and
so
she
got
a
new
soupirant
has
she
the
little
porteress
dayvlish
nice
little
girl
how
mad
pen
will
be
eh
warrington
but
we
must
break
it
to
him
gently
or
he
be
in
such
a
rage
that
he
will
be
going
after
her
again
we
must
menager
the
young
i
think
pendennis
ought
to
know
that
pen
acted
very
well
in
the
business
she
evidently
thinks
him
guilty
and
according
to
bows
arthur
behaved
like
a
good
fellow
warrington
said
my
dear
warrington
said
the
major
with
a
look
of
some
alarm
in
pendennis
agitated
state
of
health
and
that
sort
of
thing
the
best
way
i
think
is
not
to
say
a
single
word
about
the
subject
or
stay
leave
it
to
me
and
i
talk
to
her
break
it
to
her
gently
you
know
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
give
you
my
word
i
will
and
so
calypso
consoled
is
she
and
he
sniggered
over
this
gratifying
truth
happy
in
the
corner
of
the
omnibus
during
the
rest
of
the
journey
pen
was
very
anxious
to
hear
from
his
envoy
what
had
been
the
result
of
the
latter
mission
and
as
soon
as
the
two
young
men
could
be
alone
the
ambassador
spoke
in
reply
to
arthur
eager
queries
you
remember
your
poem
pen
of
ariadne
in
naxos
warrington
said
devilish
bad
poetry
it
was
to
be
apres
asked
pen
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
when
theseus
left
ariadne
do
you
remember
what
happened
to
her
young
fellow
it
a
lie
it
a
lie
you
do
mean
that
cried
out
pen
starting
up
his
face
turning
red
sit
down
stoopid
warrington
said
and
with
two
fingers
pushed
pen
back
into
his
seat
again
it
better
for
you
as
it
is
young
one
he
said
sadly
in
reply
to
the
savage
flush
in
arthur
face
chapter
lvii
foreign
ground
worthy
major
pendennis
fulfilled
his
promise
to
warrington
so
far
as
to
satisfy
his
own
conscience
and
in
so
far
to
ease
poor
helen
with
regard
to
her
son
as
to
make
her
understand
that
all
connexion
between
arthur
and
the
odious
little
gatekeeper
was
at
an
end
and
that
she
need
have
no
further
anxiety
with
respect
to
an
imprudent
attachment
or
a
degrading
marriage
on
pen
part
and
that
young
fellow
mind
was
also
relieved
after
he
had
recovered
the
shock
to
his
vanity
by
thinking
that
miss
fanny
was
not
going
to
die
of
love
for
him
and
that
no
unpleasant
consequences
were
to
be
apprehended
from
the
luckless
and
brief
connexion
so
the
whole
party
were
free
to
carry
into
effect
their
projected
continental
trip
and

procured

and
passed

whence
the

took

leisurely
visiting

and

on
their

it
is
not
our
purpose
to
describe
this
tour
or
laura
delight
at
the
tranquil
and
ancient
cities
which
she
saw
for
the
first
time
or
helen
wonder
and
interest
at
the
beguine
convents
which
they
visited
or
the
almost
terror
with
which
she
saw
the
nuns
with
outstretched
arms
kneeling
before
the
illuminated
altars
and
beheld
the
strange
pomps
and
ceremonials
of
the
catholic
worship
barefooted
friars
in
the
streets
crowned
images
of
saints
and
virgins
in
the
churches
before
which
people
were
bowing
down
and
worshipping
in
direct
defiance
as
she
held
of
the
written
law
priests
in
gorgeous
robes
or
lurking
in
dark
confessionals
theatres
opened
and
people
dancing
on
sundays
all
these
new
sights
and
manners
shocked
and
bewildered
the
simple
country
lady
and
when
the
young
men
after
their
evening
drive
or
walk
returned
to
the
widow
and
her
adopted
daughter
they
found
their
books
of
devotion
on
the
table
and
at
their
entrance
laura
would
commonly
cease
reading
some
of
the
psalms
or
the
sacred
pages
which
of
all
others
helen
loved
the
late
events
connected
with
her
son
had
cruelly
shaken
her
laura
watched
with
intense
though
hidden
anxiety
every
movement
of
her
dearest
friend
and
poor
pen
was
most
constant
and
affectionate
in
waiting
upon
his
mother
whose
wounded
bosom
yearned
with
love
towards
him
though
there
was
a
secret
between
them
and
an
anguish
or
rage
almost
on
the
mother
part
to
think
that
she
was
dispossessed
somehow
of
her
son
heart
or
that
there
were
recesses
in
it
which
she
must
not
or
dared
not
enter
she
sickened
as
she
thought
of
the
sacred
days
of
boyhood
when
it
had
not
been
so
when
her
arthur
heart
had
no
secrets
and
she
was
his
all
in
all
when
he
poured
his
hopes
and
pleasures
his
childish
griefs
vanities
triumphs
into
her
willing
and
tender
embrace
when
her
home
was
his
nest
still
and
before
fate
selfishness
nature
had
driven
him
forth
on
wayward
wings
to
range
his
own
flight
to
sing
his
own
song
and
to
seek
his
own
home
and
his
own
mate
watching
this
devouring
care
and
racking
disappointment
in
her
friend
laura
once
said
to
helen
if
pen
had
loved
me
as
you
wished
i
should
have
gained
him
but
i
should
have
lost
you
mamma
i
know
i
should
and
i
like
you
to
love
me
best
men
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
love
as
we
do
i
think
and
helen
sighing
agreed
to
this
portion
of
the
young
lady
speech
though
she
protested
against
the
former
part
for
my
part
i
suppose
miss
laura
was
right
in
both
statements
and
with
regard
to
the
latter
assertion
especially
that
it
is
an
old
and
received
truism
love
is
an
hour
with
us
it
is
all
night
and
all
day
with
a
woman
damon
has
taxes
sermon
parade
tailors
bills
parliamentary
duties
and
the
deuce
knows
what
to
think
of
delia
has
to
think
about
damon
damon
is
the
oak
or
the
post
and
stands
up
and
delia
is
the
ivy
or
the
honeysuckle
whose
arms
twine
about
him
is
it
not
so
delia
is
it
not
your
nature
to
creep
about
his
feet
and
kiss
them
to
twine
round
his
trunk
and
hang
there
and
damon
to
stand
like
a
british
man
with
his
hands
in
his
breeches
pocket
while
the
pretty
fond
parasite
clings
round
him
old
pendennis
had
only
accompanied
our
friends
to
the
water
edge
and
left
them
on
board
the
boat
giving
the
chief
charge
of
the
little
expedition
to
warrington
he
himself
was
bound
on
a
brief
visit
to
the
house
of
a
great
man
a
friend
of
his
after
which
sojourn
he
proposed
to
join
his
at
the
german
whither
the
party
was
bound
the
major
himself
thought
that
his
long
attentions
to
his
sick
family
had
earned
for
him
a
little
relaxation
and
though
the
best
of
the
partridges
were
thinned
off
the
pheasants
were
still
to
be
shot
at
stillbrook
where
the
noble
owner
still
was
old
pendennis
betook
himself
to
that
hospitable
mansion
and
disported
there
with
great
comfort
to
himself
a
royal
duke
some
foreigners
of
note
some
illustrious
statesmen
and
some
pleasant
people
visited
it
it
did
the
old
fellow
heart
good
to
see
his
name
in
the
morning
post
amongst
the
list
of
the
distinguished
company
which
the
marquis
of
steyne
was
entertaining
at
his
at
stillbrook
he
was
a
very
useful
and
pleasant
personage
in
a
he
entertained
the
young
men
with
queer
little
anecdotes
and
grivoises
stories
on
their
or
in
their
where
they
laughed
at
him
and
with
him
he
was
obsequious
with
the
ladies
of
a
morning
in
the
rooms
dedicated
to
them
he
walked
the
new
arrivals
about
the
park
and
gardens
and
showed
them
the
carte
du
pays
and
where
there
was
the
best
view
of
the
mansion
and
where
the
most
favourable
point
to
look
at
the
lake
he
showed
where
the
timber
was
to
be
felled
and
where
the
old
road
went
before
the
new
bridge
was
built
and
the
hill
cut
down
and
where
the
place
in
the
wood
was
where
old
lord
lynx
discovered
sir
phelim
on
his
knees
before
her
ladyship
etc
etc
he
called
the
and
gardeners
by
their
names
he
knew
the
number
of
domestics
that
sat
down
in
the
housekeeper
room
and
how
many
dined
in
the
he
had
a
word
for
everybody
and
about
everybody
and
a
little
against
everybody
he
was
invaluable
in
a
in
a
word
and
richly
merited
and
enjoyed
his
vacation
after
his
labours
and
perhaps
whilst
he
was
thus
deservedly
enjoying
himself
with
his
country
friends
the
major
was
not
ill
pleased
at
transferring
to
warrington
the
command
of
the
family
expedition
to
the
continent
and
thus
perforce
keeping
him
in
the
service
of
the
ladies
a
servitude
which
george
was
only
too
willing
to
undergo
for
his
friend
sake
and
for
that
of
a
society
which
he
found
daily
more
delightful
warrington
was
a
good
german
scholar
and
was
willing
to
give
miss
laura
lessons
in
the
language
who
was
very
glad
to
improve
herself
though
pen
for
his
part
was
too
weak
or
lazy
now
to
resume
his
german
studies
warrington
acted
as
courier
and
interpreter
warrington
saw
the
baggage
in
and
out
of
ships
inns
and
carriages
managed
the
money
matters
and
put
the
little
troop
into
marching
order
warrington
found
out
where
the
english
church
was
and
if
pendennis
and
miss
laura
were
inclined
to
go
thither
walked
with
great
decorum
along
with
them
warrington
walked
by
pendennis
donkey
when
that
lady
went
out
on
her
evening
excursions
or
took
carriages
for
her
or
got
for
her
or
devised
comfortable
seats
under
the
for
her
when
the
guests
paraded
after
dinner
and
the
kursaal
band
at
the
bath
where
our
tired
friends
stopped
performed
their
pleasant
music
under
the
trees
many
a
fine
whiskered
prussian
or
french
dandy
come
to
the
bath
for
the
cast
glances
of
longing
towards
the
pretty
english
girl
who
accompanied
the
pale
widow
and
would
have
longed
to
take
a
turn
with
her
at
the
galop
or
the
waltz
but
laura
did
not
appear
in
the
ballroom
except
once
or
twice
when
pen
vouchsafed
to
walk
with
her
and
as
for
warrington
that
rough
diamond
had
not
had
the
polish
of
a
and
he
did
not
know
how
to
waltz
though
he
would
have
liked
to
learn
if
he
could
have
had
such
a
partner
as
such
a
partner
psha
what
had
a
stiff
bachelor
to
do
with
partners
and
waltzing
what
was
he
about
dancing
attendance
here
drinking
in
sweet
pleasure
at
a
risk
he
knows
not
of
what
and
regret
and
lonely
longing
but
yet
he
stayed
on
you
would
have
said
he
was
the
widow
son
to
watch
his
constant
care
and
watchfulness
of
her
or
that
he
was
an
adventurer
and
wanted
to
marry
her
fortune
or
at
any
rate
that
he
wanted
some
very
great
treasure
or
benefit
from
her
and
very
likely
he
did
for
ours
as
the
reader
has
possibly
already
discovered
is
a
selfish
story
and
almost
every
person
according
to
his
nature
more
or
less
generous
than
george
and
according
to
the
way
of
the
world
as
it
seems
to
us
is
occupied
about
number
one
so
warrington
selfishly
devoted
himself
to
helen
who
selfishly
devoted
herself
to
pen
who
selfishly
devoted
himself
to
himself
at
this
present
period
having
no
other
personage
or
object
to
occupy
him
except
indeed
his
mother
health
which
gave
him
a
serious
and
real
disquiet
but
though
they
sate
together
they
did
not
talk
much
and
the
cloud
was
always
between
them
every
day
laura
looked
for
warrington
and
received
him
with
more
frank
and
eager
welcome
he
found
himself
talking
to
her
as
he
know
himself
that
he
could
talk
he
found
himself
performing
acts
of
gallantry
which
astounded
him
after
the
performance
he
found
himself
looking
blankly
in
the
glass
at
the
crow
feet
round
his
eyes
and
at
some
streaks
of
white
in
his
hair
and
some
intrusive
silver
bristles
in
his
grim
blue
beard
he
found
himself
looking
at
the
young
bucks
at
the
bath
at
the
bland
germans
at
the
capering
frenchmen
with
their
lacquered
mustachios
and
trim
varnished
boots
at
the
english
dandies
pen
amongst
them
with
their
calm
domineering
air
and
insolent
languor
and
envied
each
one
of
these
some
excellence
or
quality
of
youth
or
good
looks
which
he
possessed
and
of
which
warrington
felt
the
need
and
every
night
as
the
night
came
he
quitted
the
little
circle
with
greater
reluctance
and
retiring
to
his
own
lodging
in
their
neighbourhood
felt
himself
the
more
lonely
and
unhappy
the
widow
could
not
help
seeing
his
attachment
she
understood
now
why
major
pendennis
always
a
tacit
enemy
of
her
darling
project
had
been
so
eager
that
warrington
should
be
of
their
party
laura
frankly
owned
her
great
her
enthusiastic
regard
for
him
and
arthur
would
make
no
movement
arthur
did
not
choose
to
see
what
was
going
on
or
did
not
care
to
prevent
or
actually
encouraged
it
she
remembered
his
often
having
said
that
he
could
not
understand
how
a
man
proposed
to
a
woman
twice
she
was
in
torture
at
secret
feud
with
her
son
of
all
objects
in
the
world
the
dearest
to
her
in
doubt
which
she
dared
not
express
to
herself
about
laura
averse
to
warrington
the
good
and
generous
no
wonder
that
the
healing
waters
of
rosenbad
did
not
do
her
good
or
that
doctor
von
glauber
the
bath
physician
when
he
came
to
visit
her
found
that
the
poor
lady
made
no
progress
to
recovery
meanwhile
pen
got
well
rapidly
slept
with
immense
perseverance
twelve
hours
out
of
the
ate
huge
meals
and
at
the
end
of
a
couple
of
months
had
almost
got
back
the
bodily
strength
and
weight
which
he
had
possessed
before
his
illness
after
they
had
passed
some
fifteen
days
at
their
place
of
rest
and
refreshment
a
letter
came
from
major
pendennis
announcing
his
speedy
arrival
at
rosenbad
and
soon
after
the
letter
the
major
himself
made
his
appearance
accompanied
by
morgan
his
faithful
valet
without
whom
the
old
gentleman
could
not
move
when
the
major
travelled
he
wore
a
jaunty
and
juvenile
travelling
costume
to
see
his
back
still
you
would
have
taken
him
for
one
of
the
young
fellows
whose
slim
waist
and
youthful
appearance
warrington
was
beginning
to
envy
it
was
not
until
the
worthy
man
began
to
move
that
the
observer
remarked
that
time
had
weakened
his
ancient
knees
and
had
unkindly
interfered
to
impede
the
action
of
the
natty
little
varnished
boots
in
which
the
gay
old
traveller
still
pinched
his
toes
there
were
magnates
both
of
our
own
country
and
of
foreign
nations
present
that
autumn
at
rosenbad
the
elder
pendennis
read
over
the
strangers
list
with
great
gratification
on
the
night
of
his
arrival
was
pleased
to
find
several
of
his
acquaintances
among
the
great
folks
and
would
have
the
honour
of
presenting
his
nephew
to
a
german
grand
duchess
a
russian
princess
and
an
english
marquis
before
many
days
were
over
nor
was
pen
by
any
means
averse
to
making
the
acquaintance
of
these
great
personages
having
a
liking
for
polite
life
and
all
the
splendours
and
amenities
belonging
to
it
that
very
evening
the
resolute
old
gentleman
leaning
on
his
nephew
arm
made
his
appearance
in
the
halls
of
the
kursaal
and
lost
or
won
a
napoleon
or
two
at
the
table
of
he
did
not
play
to
lose
he
said
or
to
win
but
he
did
as
other
folks
did
and
betted
his
napoleon
and
took
his
luck
as
it
came
he
pointed
out
the
russians
and
spaniards
gambling
for
heaps
of
gold
and
denounced
their
eagerness
as
something
sordid
and
barbarous
an
english
gentleman
should
play
where
the
fashion
is
play
but
should
not
elate
or
depress
himself
at
the
sport
and
he
told
how
he
had
seen
his
friend
the
marquis
of
steyne
when
lord
gaunt
lose
eighteen
thousand
at
a
sitting
and
break
the
bank
three
nights
running
at
paris
without
ever
showing
the
least
emotion
at
his
defeat
or
victory
and
that
what
i
call
being
an
english
gentleman
pen
my
dear
boy
the
old
gentleman
said
warming
as
he
prattled
about
his
recollections
what
i
call
the
great
manner
only
remains
with
us
and
with
a
few
families
in
and
as
russian
princesses
passed
him
whose
reputation
had
long
ceased
to
be
doubtful
and
damaged
english
ladies
who
are
constantly
seen
in
company
of
their
faithful
attendant
for
the
time
being
in
these
gay
haunts
of
dissipation
the
old
major
with
eager
garrulity
and
mischievous
relish
told
his
nephew
wonderful
particulars
regarding
the
lives
of
these
heroines
and
diverted
the
young
man
with
a
thousand
scandals
egad
he
felt
himself
quite
young
again
he
remarked
to
pen
as
rouged
and
grinning
her
enormous
chasseur
behind
her
bearing
her
shawl
the
princess
obstropski
smiled
and
recognised
and
accosted
him
he
remembered
her
in
when
she
was
an
actress
of
the
paris
boulevard
and
the
emperor
alexander
obstropski
a
man
of
great
talents
who
knew
a
good
deal
about
the
emperor
paul
death
and
was
a
devil
to
play
married
her
he
most
courteously
and
respectfully
asked
leave
to
call
upon
the
princess
and
to
present
to
her
his
nephew
arthur
pendennis
and
he
pointed
out
to
the
latter
a
of
other
personages
whose
names
were
as
famous
and
whose
histories
were
as
satisfying
what
would
poor
helen
have
thought
could
she
have
heard
those
tales
or
known
to
what
kind
of
people
her
was
presenting
her
son
only
once
leaning
on
arthur
arm
she
had
passed
through
the
room
where
the
green
tables
were
prepared
for
play
and
the
croaking
croupiers
were
calling
out
their
fatal
words
of
rouge
gagne
and
couleur
perd
she
had
shrunk
terrified
out
of
the
pandemonium
imploring
pen
extorting
from
him
a
promise
on
his
word
of
honour
that
he
would
never
play
at
those
tables
and
the
scene
which
so
frightened
the
simple
widow
only
amused
the
worldly
old
veteran
and
made
him
young
again
he
could
breathe
the
air
cheerfully
which
stifled
her
her
right
was
not
his
right
his
food
was
her
poison
human
creatures
are
constituted
thus
differently
and
with
this
variety
the
marvellous
world
is
peopled
to
the
credit
of
mr
pen
let
it
be
said
that
he
kept
honestly
the
promise
made
to
his
mother
and
stoutly
told
his
uncle
of
his
intention
to
abide
by
it
when
the
major
arrived
his
presence
somehow
cast
a
damp
upon
at
least
three
of
the
persons
of
our
little
party
upon
laura
who
had
anything
but
respect
for
him
upon
warrington
whose
manner
towards
him
showed
an
involuntary
haughtiness
and
contempt
and
upon
the
timid
and
alarmed
widow
who
dreaded
lest
he
should
interfere
with
her
darling
though
almost
desperate
projects
for
her
boy
and
indeed
the
major
unknown
to
himself
was
the
bearer
of
tidings
which
were
to
bring
about
a
catastrophe
in
the
affairs
of
all
our
friends
pen
with
his
two
ladies
had
apartments
in
the
town
of
rosenbad
honest
warrington
had
lodgings
hard
by
the
major
on
arrival
at
rosenbad
had
as
befitted
his
dignity
taken
his
quarters
at
one
of
the
great
hotels
at
the
roman
emperor
or
the
four
seasons
where
two
or
three
hundred
gamblers
or
invalids
sate
down
and
themselves
daily
at
the
enormous
to
this
hotel
pen
went
on
the
morning
after
the
major
arrival
dutifully
to
pay
his
respects
to
his
uncle
and
found
the
latter
duly
prepared
and
arranged
by
morgan
with
the
major
hats
brushed
and
his
coats
laid
out
his
and
his
guidebooks
passports
maps
and
other
elaborate
necessaries
of
the
english
traveller
all
as
trim
and
ready
as
they
could
be
in
their
master
own
room
in
jermyn
street
everything
was
ready
from
the
fresh
filled
from
the
pharmacien
down
to
the
old
without
which
he
never
travelled
for
he
made
a
point
of
appearing
at
the
english
church
at
every
place
which
he
honoured
with
a
stay
everybody
did
it
he
said
every
english
gentleman
did
it
and
this
pious
man
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
not
calling
upon
the
english
ambassador
in
a
continental
town
as
of
not
showing
himself
at
the
national
place
of
worship
the
old
gentleman
had
been
to
take
one
of
the
baths
for
which
rosenbad
is
famous
and
which
everybody
takes
and
his
toilet
was
not
yet
completed
when
pen
arrived
the
elder
called
out
to
arthur
in
a
cheery
voice
from
the
inner
apartment
in
which
he
and
morgan
were
engaged
and
the
valet
presently
came
in
bearing
a
little
packet
to
pen
address
arthur
letters
and
papers
morgan
said
which
he
had
brought
from
arthur
chambers
in
london
and
which
consisted
chiefly
of
numbers
of
the
pall
mall
gazette
which
our
friend
finucane
thought
his
collaborateur
would
like
to
see
the
papers
were
tied
together
the
letters
in
an
envelope
addressed
to
pen
in
the
gentleman
handwriting
amongst
the
letters
there
was
a
little
note
addressed
as
a
former
letter
we
have
heard
of
had
been
to
arther
pendennis
esquire
which
arthur
opened
with
a
start
and
a
blush
and
read
with
a
very
keen
pang
of
interest
and
sorrow
and
regard
she
had
come
to
arthur
house
fanny
bolton
said
and
found
that
he
was
gone
gone
away
to
germany
without
ever
leaving
a
word
for
her
or
answer
to
her
last
letter
in
which
she
prayed
but
for
one
word
of
kindness
or
the
books
which
he
had
promised
her
in
happier
times
before
he
was
ill
and
which
she
should
like
to
keep
in
remembrance
of
him
she
said
she
would
not
reproach
those
who
had
found
her
at
his
bedside
when
he
was
in
the
fever
and
knew
nobody
and
who
had
turned
the
poor
girl
away
without
a
word
she
thought
she
should
have
died
she
said
of
that
but
doctor
goodenough
had
kindly
tended
her
and
kept
her
life
when
perhaps
the
keeping
of
it
was
of
no
good
and
she
forgave
everybody
and
as
for
arthur
she
would
pray
for
him
for
ever
and
when
he
was
so
ill
and
they
cut
off
his
hair
she
had
made
so
free
as
to
keep
one
little
lock
for
herself
and
that
she
owned
and
might
she
still
keep
it
or
would
his
mamma
order
that
that
should
be
gave
up
too
she
was
willing
to
obey
him
in
all
things
and
could
but
remember
that
once
he
was
so
kind
oh
so
good
and
kind
to
his
poor
fanny
when
major
pendennis
fresh
and
smirking
from
his
toilet
came
out
of
his
bedroom
to
his
he
found
arthur
with
this
note
before
him
and
an
expression
of
savage
anger
on
his
face
which
surprised
the
elder
gentleman
what
news
from
london
my
boy
he
rather
faintly
asked
are
the
duns
at
you
that
you
look
so
glum
do
you
know
anything
about
this
letter
sir
arthur
asked
what
letter
my
good
sir
said
the
other
dryly
at
once
perceiving
what
had
happened
you
know
what
i
mean
about
about
miss
about
fanny
bolton
the
poor
dear
little
girl
arthur
broke
out
when
she
was
in
my
room
was
she
there
when
i
was
delirious
i
fancied
she
was
was
she
who
sent
her
out
of
my
chambers
who
intercepted
her
letters
to
me
who
dared
to
do
it
did
you
do
it
uncle
it
not
my
practice
to
tamper
with
gentlemen
letters
or
to
answer
damned
impertinent
questions
major
pendennis
cried
out
in
a
great
tremor
of
emotion
and
indignation
there
was
a
girl
in
your
rooms
when
i
came
up
at
great
personal
inconvenience
daymy
and
to
meet
with
a
return
of
this
kind
for
my
affection
to
you
is
not
pleasant
by
gad
sir
not
at
all
that
not
the
question
sir
arthur
said
hotly
and
i
beg
your
pardon
uncle
you
were
you
always
have
been
most
kind
to
me
but
i
say
again
did
you
say
anything
harsh
to
this
poor
girl
did
you
send
her
away
from
me
i
never
spoke
a
word
to
the
girl
the
uncle
said
and
i
never
sent
her
away
from
you
and
know
no
more
about
her
and
wish
to
know
no
more
about
her
than
about
the
man
in
the
then
it
my
mother
that
did
it
arthur
broke
out
did
my
mother
send
that
poor
child
away
i
repeat
i
know
nothing
about
it
sir
the
elder
said
testily
change
the
subject
if
you
i
never
forgive
the
person
who
did
it
said
arthur
bouncing
up
and
seizing
his
hat
the
major
cried
out
stop
arthur
for
god
sake
stop
but
before
he
had
uttered
his
sentence
arthur
had
rushed
out
of
the
room
and
at
the
next
minute
the
major
saw
him
striding
rapidly
down
the
street
that
led
towards
his
home
get
breakfast
said
the
old
fellow
to
morgan
and
he
wagged
his
head
and
sighed
as
he
looked
out
of
the
window
poor
helen
poor
soul
there
be
a
row
i
knew
there
would
and
begad
all
the
fat
in
the
when
pen
reached
home
he
only
found
warrington
in
the
waiting
their
arrival
in
order
to
conduct
them
to
the
room
where
the
little
english
colony
at
rosenbad
held
their
sunday
church
helen
and
laura
had
not
appeared
as
yet
the
former
was
ailing
and
her
daughter
was
with
her
pen
wrath
was
so
great
that
he
could
not
defer
expressing
it
he
flung
fanny
letter
across
the
table
to
his
friend
look
there
warrington
he
said
she
tended
me
in
my
illness
she
rescued
me
out
of
the
jaws
of
death
and
this
is
the
way
they
have
treated
the
dear
little
creature
they
have
kept
her
letters
from
me
they
have
treated
me
like
a
child
and
her
like
a
dog
poor
thing
my
mother
has
done
if
she
has
you
must
remember
it
is
your
mother
warrington
interposed
it
only
makes
the
crime
the
greater
because
it
is
she
who
has
done
it
pen
answered
she
ought
to
have
been
the
poor
girl
defender
not
her
enemy
she
ought
to
go
down
on
her
knees
and
ask
pardon
of
her
i
ought
i
will
i
am
shocked
at
the
cruelty
which
has
been
shown
her
what
she
gave
me
her
all
and
this
is
her
return
she
sacrifices
everything
for
me
and
they
spurn
hush
said
warrington
they
can
hear
you
from
the
next
hear
let
them
hear
pen
cried
out
only
so
much
the
louder
those
may
overhear
my
talk
who
intercept
my
letters
i
say
this
poor
girl
has
been
shamefully
used
and
i
will
do
my
best
to
right
her
i
the
door
of
the
neighbouring
room
opened
and
laura
came
forth
with
a
pale
and
stern
face
she
looked
at
pen
with
glances
from
which
beamed
pride
defiance
aversion
arthur
your
mother
is
very
ill
she
said
it
is
a
pity
that
you
should
speak
so
loud
as
to
disturb
it
is
a
pity
that
i
should
have
been
obliged
to
speak
at
all
pen
answered
and
i
have
more
to
say
before
i
have
i
should
think
what
you
have
to
say
will
hardly
be
fit
for
me
to
hear
laura
said
haughtily
you
are
welcome
to
hear
it
or
not
as
you
like
said
mr
pen
i
shall
go
in
now
and
speak
to
my
laura
came
rapidly
forward
so
that
she
should
not
be
overheard
by
her
friend
within
not
now
sir
she
said
to
pen
you
may
kill
her
if
you
do
your
conduct
has
gone
far
enough
to
make
her
what
conduct
cried
out
pen
in
a
fury
who
dares
impugn
it
who
dares
meddle
with
me
is
it
you
who
are
the
instigator
of
this
persecution
i
said
before
it
was
a
subject
of
which
it
did
not
become
me
to
hear
or
to
speak
laura
said
but
as
for
mamma
if
she
had
acted
otherwise
than
she
did
with
regard
to
to
the
person
about
whom
you
seem
to
take
such
an
interest
it
would
have
been
i
that
must
have
quitted
your
house
and
not
that
that
by
heavens
this
is
too
much
pen
cried
out
with
a
violent
execration
perhaps
that
is
what
you
wished
laura
said
tossing
her
head
up
no
more
of
this
if
you
please
i
am
not
accustomed
to
hear
such
subjects
spoken
of
in
such
language
and
with
a
stately
curtsey
the
young
lady
passed
to
her
room
looking
her
adversary
full
in
the
face
as
she
retreated
and
closed
the
door
upon
him
pen
was
bewildered
with
wonder
perplexity
fury
at
this
monstrous
and
unreasonable
persecution
he
burst
out
into
a
loud
and
bitter
laugh
as
laura
quitted
him
and
with
sneers
and
revilings
as
a
man
who
jeers
under
an
operation
ridiculed
at
once
his
own
pain
and
his
anger
the
laugh
which
was
one
of
bitter
humour
and
no
unmanly
or
unkindly
expression
of
suffering
under
most
cruel
and
unmerited
torture
was
heard
in
the
next
apartment
as
some
of
his
unlucky
previous
expressions
had
been
and
like
them
entirely
misinterpreted
by
the
hearers
it
struck
like
a
dagger
into
the
wounded
and
tender
heart
of
helen
it
pierced
laura
and
inflamed
the
girl
with
scorn
and
anger
and
it
was
to
this
hardened
libertine
she
thought
to
this
boaster
of
low
intrigues
that
i
had
given
my
heart
he
breaks
the
most
sacred
laws
thought
helen
he
prefers
the
creature
of
his
passion
to
his
own
mother
and
when
he
is
upbraided
he
laughs
and
glories
in
his
crime
gave
me
her
all
i
heard
him
say
it
argued
the
poor
widow
and
he
boasts
of
it
and
laughs
and
breaks
his
mother
the
emotion
the
shame
the
grief
the
mortification
almost
killed
her
she
felt
she
should
die
of
his
unkindness
warrington
thought
of
laura
speech
perhaps
that
is
what
you
she
loves
pen
still
he
said
it
was
jealousy
made
her
come
away
pen
come
away
and
let
us
go
to
church
and
get
calm
you
must
explain
this
matter
to
your
mother
she
does
not
appear
to
know
the
truth
nor
do
you
quite
my
good
fellow
come
away
and
let
us
talk
about
and
again
he
muttered
to
himself
that
is
what
you
wished
yes
she
loves
him
why
should
she
love
him
whom
else
would
i
have
her
love
what
can
she
be
to
me
but
the
dearest
and
the
fairest
and
the
best
of
women
so
leaving
the
women
similarly
engaged
within
the
two
gentlemen
walked
away
each
occupied
with
his
own
thought
and
silent
for
a
considerable
space
i
must
set
this
matter
right
thought
honest
george
as
she
loves
him
still
i
must
set
his
mind
right
about
the
other
and
with
this
charitable
thought
the
good
fellow
began
to
tell
more
at
large
what
bows
had
said
to
him
regarding
miss
bolton
behaviour
and
fickleness
and
he
described
how
the
girl
was
no
better
than
a
little
flirt
and
perhaps
he
exaggerated
the
and
contentedness
which
he
had
himself
as
he
thought
witnessed
in
her
behaviour
in
the
scene
with
huxter
now
all
bows
statements
had
been
coloured
by
an
insane
jealousy
and
rage
on
that
old
man
part
and
instead
of
allaying
pen
renascent
desire
to
see
his
little
conquest
again
warrington
accounts
inflamed
and
angered
pendennis
and
made
him
more
anxious
than
before
to
set
himself
right
as
he
persisted
in
phrasing
it
with
fanny
they
arrived
at
the
church
door
presently
but
scarce
one
word
of
the
service
and
not
a
syllable
of
shamble
sermon
did
either
of
them
comprehend
probably
so
much
was
each
engaged
with
his
own
private
speculations
the
major
came
up
to
them
after
the
service
with
his
hat
and
wig
and
his
jauntiest
most
cheerful
air
he
complimented
them
upon
being
seen
at
church
again
he
said
that
every
faut
person
made
a
point
of
attending
the
english
service
abroad
and
he
walked
back
with
the
young
men
prattling
to
them
in
garrulous
and
making
bows
to
his
acquaintances
as
they
passed
and
thinking
innocently
that
pen
and
george
were
both
highly
delighted
by
his
anecdotes
which
they
suffered
to
run
on
in
a
scornful
and
silent
acquiescence
at
the
time
of
shamble
sermon
an
erratic
anglican
divine
hired
for
the
season
at
places
of
english
resort
and
addicted
to
debts
drinking
and
even
to
roulette
it
was
said
pen
chafing
under
the
persecution
which
his
womankind
inflicted
upon
him
had
been
meditating
a
great
act
of
revolt
and
of
justice
as
he
had
worked
himself
up
to
believe
and
warrington
on
his
part
had
been
thinking
that
a
crisis
in
his
affairs
had
likewise
come
and
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
break
away
from
a
connexion
which
every
day
made
more
and
more
wretched
and
dear
to
him
yes
the
time
was
come
he
took
those
fatal
words
perhaps
that
is
what
you
wished
as
a
text
for
a
gloomy
homily
which
he
preached
to
himself
in
the
dark
pew
of
his
own
heart
whilst
shamble
was
feebly
giving
utterance
to
his
sermon
chapter
lviii
fairoaks
to
let
our
poor
widow
with
the
assistance
of
her
faithful
martha
of
fairoaks
who
laughed
and
wondered
at
the
german
ways
and
superintend
the
affairs
of
the
simple
household
had
made
a
little
feast
in
honour
of
major
pendennis
arrival
of
which
however
only
the
major
and
his
two
younger
friends
partook
for
helen
sent
to
say
that
she
was
too
unwell
to
dine
at
their
table
and
laura
bore
her
company
the
major
talked
for
the
party
and
did
not
perceive
or
choose
to
perceive
what
a
gloom
and
silence
pervaded
the
other
two
sharers
of
the
modest
dinner
it
was
evening
before
helen
and
laura
came
into
the
to
join
the
company
there
she
came
in
leaning
on
laura
with
her
back
to
the
waning
light
so
that
arthur
could
not
see
how
pallid
and
her
face
was
and
as
she
went
up
to
pen
whom
she
had
not
seen
during
the
day
and
placed
her
fond
arms
on
his
shoulders
and
kissed
him
tenderly
laura
left
her
and
moved
away
to
another
part
of
the
room
pen
remarked
that
his
mother
voice
and
her
whole
frame
trembled
her
hand
was
clammy
cold
as
she
put
it
up
to
his
forehead
piteously
embracing
him
the
spectacle
of
her
misery
only
added
somehow
to
the
wrath
and
testiness
of
the
young
man
he
scarcely
returned
the
kiss
which
the
suffering
lady
gave
him
and
the
countenance
with
which
he
met
the
appeal
of
her
look
was
hard
and
cruel
she
persecutes
me
he
thought
within
himself
and
she
comes
to
me
with
the
air
of
a
martyr
you
look
very
ill
my
child
she
said
i
do
like
to
see
you
look
in
that
and
she
tottered
to
a
sofa
still
holding
one
of
his
passive
hands
in
her
thin
cold
clinging
fingers
i
have
had
much
to
annoy
me
mother
pen
said
with
a
throbbing
breast
and
as
he
spoke
helen
heart
began
to
beat
so
that
she
sate
almost
dead
and
speechless
with
terror
warrington
laura
and
major
pendennis
all
remained
breathless
aware
that
the
storm
was
about
to
break
i
have
had
letters
from
london
arthur
continued
and
one
that
has
given
me
more
pain
than
i
ever
had
in
my
life
it
tells
me
that
former
letters
of
mine
have
been
intercepted
and
purloined
away
from
me
that
that
a
young
creature
who
has
shown
the
greatest
love
and
care
for
me
has
been
most
cruelly
used
by
by
you
for
god
sake
stop
cried
out
warrington
she
ill
do
you
see
she
is
ill
let
him
go
on
said
the
widow
faintly
let
him
go
on
and
kill
her
said
laura
rushing
up
to
her
side
speak
on
sir
and
see
her
it
is
you
who
are
cruel
cried
pen
more
exasperated
and
more
savage
because
his
own
heart
naturally
soft
and
weak
revolted
indignantly
at
the
injustice
of
the
very
suffering
which
was
laid
at
his
door
it
is
you
that
are
cruel
who
attribute
all
this
pain
to
me
it
is
you
who
are
cruel
with
your
wicked
reproaches
your
wicked
doubts
of
me
your
wicked
persecutions
of
those
who
love
me
yes
those
who
love
me
and
who
brave
everything
for
me
and
whom
you
despise
and
trample
upon
because
they
are
of
lower
degree
than
you
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
what
i
am
resolved
to
do
now
that
i
know
what
your
conduct
has
been
i
will
go
back
to
this
poor
girl
whom
you
turned
out
of
my
doors
and
ask
her
to
come
back
and
share
my
home
with
me
i
defy
the
pride
which
persecutes
her
and
the
pitiless
suspicion
which
insults
her
and
do
you
mean
pen
that
you
here
the
widow
with
eager
eyes
and
outstretched
hands
was
breaking
out
but
laura
stopped
her
silence
hush
dear
mother
she
cried
and
the
widow
hushed
savagely
as
pen
spoke
she
was
only
too
eager
to
hear
what
more
he
had
to
say
go
on
arthur
go
on
arthur
was
all
she
said
almost
swooning
away
as
she
spoke
by
gad
i
say
he
sha
go
on
or
i
wo
hear
him
by
gad
the
major
said
trembling
too
in
his
wrath
if
you
choose
sir
after
all
done
for
you
after
all
i
done
for
you
myself
to
insult
your
mother
and
disgrace
your
name
by
allying
yourself
with
a
go
and
do
it
by
gad
but
let
us
have
no
more
to
do
with
him
i
wash
my
hands
of
you
sir
i
wash
my
hands
of
you
an
old
fellow
i
ai
long
for
this
world
i
come
of
as
ancient
and
honourable
a
family
as
any
in
england
by
gad
and
i
did
hope
before
i
went
off
the
hooks
by
gad
that
the
fellow
that
i
liked
and
brought
up
and
nursed
through
life
by
jove
would
do
something
to
show
me
that
our
name
yes
the
name
of
pendennis
by
gad
was
left
undishonoured
behind
us
but
if
he
wo
dammy
i
say
amen
by
g
both
my
father
and
my
brother
jack
were
the
proudest
men
in
england
and
i
never
would
have
thought
that
there
would
come
this
disgrace
to
my
name
never
and
and
i
ashamed
that
it
arthur
the
old
fellow
voice
here
broke
off
into
a
sob
it
was
the
second
time
that
arthur
had
brought
tears
from
those
wrinkled
lids
the
sound
of
his
breaking
voice
stayed
pen
anger
instantly
and
he
stopped
pacing
the
room
as
he
had
been
doing
until
that
moment
laura
was
by
helen
sofa
and
warrington
had
remained
hitherto
an
almost
silent
but
not
uninterested
spectator
of
the
family
storm
as
the
parties
were
talking
it
had
grown
almost
dark
and
after
the
lull
which
succeeded
the
passionate
outbreak
of
the
major
george
deep
voice
as
it
here
broke
trembling
into
the
twilight
room
was
heard
with
no
small
emotion
by
all
will
you
let
me
tell
you
something
about
myself
my
kind
friends
he
said
you
have
been
so
good
to
me
you
have
been
so
kind
to
me
laura
i
hope
i
may
call
you
so
sometimes
my
dear
pen
and
i
have
been
such
friends
that
i
have
long
wanted
to
tell
you
my
story
such
as
it
is
and
would
have
told
it
to
you
earlier
but
that
it
is
a
sad
one
and
contains
another
secret
however
it
may
do
good
for
arthur
to
know
it
it
is
right
that
every
one
here
should
it
will
divert
you
from
thinking
about
a
subject
which
out
of
a
fatal
misconception
has
caused
a
great
deal
of
pain
to
all
of
you
may
i
please
tell
you
pendennis
pray
speak
was
all
helen
said
and
indeed
she
was
not
much
heeding
her
mind
was
full
of
another
idea
with
which
pen
words
had
supplied
her
and
she
was
in
a
terror
of
hope
that
what
he
had
hinted
might
be
as
she
wished
george
filled
himself
a
bumper
of
wine
and
emptied
it
and
began
to
speak
you
all
of
you
know
how
you
see
me
he
said
a
man
without
a
desire
to
make
an
advance
in
the
world
careless
about
reputation
and
living
in
a
garret
and
from
hand
to
mouth
though
i
have
friends
and
a
name
and
i
daresay
capabilities
of
my
own
that
would
serve
me
if
i
had
a
mind
but
mind
i
have
none
i
shall
die
in
that
garret
most
likely
and
alone
i
nailed
myself
to
that
doom
in
early
life
shall
i
tell
you
what
it
was
that
interested
me
about
arthur
years
ago
and
made
me
inclined
towards
him
when
first
i
saw
him
the
men
from
our
college
at
oxbridge
brought
up
accounts
of
that
early
affair
with
the
chatteris
actress
about
whom
pen
has
talked
to
me
since
and
who
but
for
the
major
generalship
might
have
been
your
i
ca
see
pen
in
the
dark
but
he
blushes
i
sure
and
i
dare
say
miss
bell
does
and
my
friend
major
pendennis
i
dare
say
laughs
as
he
ought
to
do
for
he
won
what
would
have
been
arthur
lot
now
had
he
been
tied
at
nineteen
to
an
illiterate
woman
older
than
himself
with
no
qualities
in
common
between
them
to
make
one
a
companion
for
the
other
no
equality
no
confidence
and
no
love
speedily
what
could
he
have
been
but
most
miserable
and
when
he
spoke
just
now
and
threatened
a
similar
union
be
sure
it
was
but
a
threat
occasioned
by
anger
which
you
must
give
me
leave
to
say
was
very
natural
on
his
part
for
after
a
generous
and
manly
conduct
let
me
say
who
know
the
circumstances
well
most
generous
and
manly
and
which
is
rare
with
him
he
has
met
from
some
friends
of
his
with
a
most
unkind
suspicion
and
has
had
to
complain
of
the
unfair
treatment
of
another
innocent
person
towards
whom
he
and
you
all
are
under
much
the
widow
was
going
to
get
up
here
and
warrington
seeing
her
attempt
to
rise
said
do
i
tire
you
oh
no
go
on
go
on
said
helen
delighted
and
he
continued
i
liked
him
you
see
because
of
that
early
history
of
his
which
had
come
to
my
ears
in
college
gossip
and
because
i
like
a
man
if
you
will
pardon
me
for
saying
so
miss
laura
who
shows
that
he
can
have
a
great
unreasonable
attachment
for
a
woman
that
was
why
we
became
friends
and
are
all
friends
here
for
always
are
we
he
added
in
a
lower
voice
leaning
over
to
her
and
pen
has
been
a
great
comfort
and
companion
to
a
lonely
and
unfortunate
man
i
am
not
complaining
of
my
lot
you
see
for
no
man
is
what
he
would
have
it
and
up
in
my
garret
where
you
left
the
flowers
and
with
my
old
books
and
my
pipe
for
a
wife
i
am
pretty
contented
and
only
occasionally
envy
other
men
whose
careers
in
life
are
more
brilliant
or
who
can
solace
their
ill
fortune
by
what
fate
and
my
own
fault
has
deprived
me
of
the
affection
of
a
woman
or
a
here
there
came
a
sigh
from
somewhere
near
warrington
in
the
dark
and
a
hand
was
held
out
in
his
direction
which
however
was
instantly
withdrawn
for
the
prudery
of
our
females
is
such
that
before
all
expression
of
feeling
or
natural
kindness
and
regard
a
woman
is
to
think
of
herself
and
the
proprieties
and
to
be
ready
to
blush
at
the
very
slightest
notice
and
checking
as
of
course
it
ought
this
spontaneous
motion
modesty
drew
up
again
kindly
friendship
shrank
back
ashamed
of
itself
and
warrington
resumed
his
history
my
fate
is
such
as
i
made
it
and
not
lucky
for
me
or
for
others
involved
in
it
i
too
had
an
adventure
before
i
went
to
college
and
there
was
no
one
to
save
me
as
major
pendennis
saved
pen
pardon
me
miss
laura
if
i
tell
this
story
before
you
it
is
as
well
that
you
all
of
you
should
hear
my
confession
before
i
went
to
college
as
a
boy
of
eighteen
i
was
at
a
private
tutor
and
there
like
arthur
i
became
attached
or
fancied
i
was
attached
to
a
woman
of
a
much
lower
degree
and
a
greater
age
than
my
own
you
shrink
from
me
no
i
do
laura
said
and
here
the
hand
went
out
resolutely
and
laid
itself
in
warrington
she
had
divined
his
story
from
some
previous
hints
let
fall
by
him
and
his
first
words
at
its
commencement
she
was
a
yeoman
daughter
in
the
neighbourhood
warrington
said
with
rather
a
faltering
voice
and
i
fancied
what
all
young
men
fancy
her
parents
knew
who
my
father
was
and
encouraged
me
with
all
sorts
of
coarse
artifices
and
scoundrel
flatteries
which
i
see
now
about
their
house
to
do
her
justice
i
own
she
never
cared
for
me
but
was
forced
into
what
happened
by
the
threats
and
compulsion
of
her
family
would
to
god
that
i
had
not
been
deceived
but
in
these
matters
we
are
deceived
because
we
wish
to
be
so
and
i
thought
i
loved
that
poor
woman
what
could
come
of
such
a
marriage
i
found
before
long
that
i
was
married
to
a
boor
she
could
not
comprehend
one
subject
that
interested
me
her
dulness
palled
upon
me
till
i
grew
to
loathe
it
and
after
some
time
of
a
wretched
furtive
union
i
must
tell
you
all
i
found
letters
somewhere
and
such
letters
they
were
which
showed
me
that
her
heart
such
as
it
was
had
never
been
mine
but
had
always
belonged
to
a
person
of
her
own
degree
at
my
father
death
i
paid
what
debts
i
had
contracted
at
college
and
settled
every
shilling
which
remained
to
me
in
an
annuity
upon
upon
those
who
bore
my
name
on
condition
that
they
should
hide
themselves
away
and
not
assume
it
they
have
kept
that
condition
as
they
would
break
it
for
more
money
if
i
had
earned
fame
or
reputation
that
woman
would
have
come
to
claim
it
if
i
had
made
a
name
for
myself
those
who
no
right
to
it
would
have
borne
it
and
i
entered
life
at
twenty
god
help
me
hopeless
and
ruined
beyond
remission
i
was
the
boyish
victim
of
vulgar
cheats
and
perhaps
it
is
only
of
late
i
have
found
out
how
hard
ah
how
hard
it
is
to
forgive
them
i
told
you
the
moral
before
pen
and
now
i
have
told
you
the
fable
beware
how
you
marry
out
of
your
degree
i
was
made
for
a
better
lot
than
this
i
think
but
god
has
awarded
me
this
one
and
so
you
see
it
is
for
me
to
look
on
and
see
others
successful
and
others
happy
with
a
heart
that
shall
be
as
little
bitter
as
by
gad
sir
cried
the
major
in
high
i
intended
you
to
marry
miss
laura
and
by
gad
master
shallow
i
owe
you
a
thousand
pound
warrington
said
how
d
mean
a
thousand
it
was
only
a
pony
sir
replied
the
major
simply
at
which
the
other
laughed
as
for
helen
she
was
so
delighted
that
she
started
up
and
said
god
bless
you
god
for
ever
bless
you
warrington
and
kissed
both
his
hands
and
ran
up
to
pen
and
fell
into
his
arms
yes
dearest
mother
he
said
as
he
held
her
to
him
and
with
a
noble
tenderness
and
emotion
embraced
and
forgave
her
i
am
innocent
and
my
dear
dear
mother
has
done
me
a
oh
yes
my
child
i
have
wronged
you
thank
god
i
have
wronged
you
helen
whispered
come
away
arthur
not
here
i
want
to
ask
my
child
to
forgive
me
and
and
my
god
to
forgive
me
and
to
bless
you
and
love
you
my
he
led
her
tottering
into
her
room
and
closed
the
door
as
the
three
touched
spectators
of
the
reconciliation
looked
on
in
pleased
silence
ever
after
ever
after
the
tender
accents
of
that
voice
faltering
sweetly
at
his
ear
the
look
of
the
sacred
eyes
beaming
with
an
affection
unutterable
the
quiver
of
the
fond
lips
smiling
mournfully
were
remembered
by
the
young
man
and
at
his
best
moments
and
at
his
hours
of
trial
and
grief
and
at
his
times
of
success
or
the
mother
face
looked
down
upon
him
and
blessed
him
with
its
gaze
of
pity
and
purity
as
he
saw
it
in
that
night
when
she
yet
lingered
with
him
and
when
she
seemed
ere
she
quite
left
him
an
angel
transfigured
and
glorified
with
love
for
which
love
as
for
the
greatest
of
the
bounties
and
wonders
of
god
provision
for
us
let
us
kneel
and
thank
our
father
the
moon
had
risen
by
this
time
arthur
recollected
well
afterwards
how
it
lighted
up
his
mother
sweet
pale
face
their
talk
or
his
rather
for
she
scarcely
could
speak
was
more
tender
and
confidential
than
it
had
been
for
years
before
he
was
the
frank
and
generous
boy
of
her
early
days
and
love
he
told
her
the
story
the
mistake
regarding
which
had
caused
her
so
much
pain
his
struggles
to
fly
from
temptation
and
his
thankfulness
that
he
had
been
able
to
overcome
it
he
never
would
do
the
girl
wrong
never
or
wound
his
own
honour
or
his
pure
heart
the
threat
that
he
would
return
was
uttered
in
a
moment
of
exasperation
of
which
he
repented
he
never
would
see
her
again
but
his
mother
said
yes
he
should
and
it
was
she
who
had
been
proud
and
culpable
and
she
would
like
to
give
fanny
bolton
something
and
she
begged
her
dear
boy
pardon
for
opening
the
letter
and
she
would
write
to
the
young
girl
if
if
she
had
time
poor
thing
was
it
not
natural
that
she
should
love
her
arthur
and
again
she
kissed
him
and
she
blessed
him
as
they
were
talking
the
clock
struck
nine
and
helen
reminded
him
how
when
he
was
a
little
boy
she
used
to
go
up
to
his
bedroom
at
that
hour
and
hear
him
say
our
father
and
once
more
oh
once
more
the
young
man
fell
down
at
his
mother
sacred
knees
and
sobbed
out
the
prayer
which
the
divine
tenderness
uttered
for
us
and
which
has
been
echoed
by
twenty
ages
since
by
millions
of
sinful
and
humbled
men
and
as
he
spoke
the
last
words
of
the
supplication
the
mother
head
fell
down
on
her
boy
and
her
arms
closed
round
him
and
together
they
repeated
the
words
for
ever
and
ever
and
a
little
time
after
it
might
have
been
a
quarter
of
an
hour
laura
heard
arthur
voice
call
from
within
laura
laura
she
rushed
into
the
room
instantly
and
found
the
young
man
still
on
his
knees
and
holding
his
mother
hand
helen
head
had
sunk
back
and
was
quite
pale
in
the
room
pen
looked
round
scared
with
a
ghastly
terror
help
laura
help
he
said
she
fainted
she
laura
screamed
and
fell
by
the
side
of
helen
the
shriek
brought
warrington
and
major
pendennis
and
the
servants
to
the
room
the
sainted
woman
was
dead
the
last
emotion
of
her
soul
here
was
joy
to
be
henceforth
unchequered
and
eternal
the
tender
heart
beat
no
more
it
was
to
have
no
more
pangs
no
more
doubts
no
more
griefs
and
trials
its
last
throb
was
love
and
helen
last
breath
was
a
benediction
the
melancholy
party
bent
their
way
speedily
homewards
and
helen
was
laid
by
her
husband
side
at
clavering
in
the
old
church
where
she
had
prayed
so
often
for
a
while
laura
went
to
stay
with
portman
who
read
the
service
over
his
dear
departed
sister
amidst
his
own
sobs
and
those
of
the
little
congregation
which
assembled
round
helen
tomb
there
were
not
many
who
cared
for
her
or
who
spoke
of
her
when
gone
scarcely
more
than
of
a
nun
in
a
cloister
did
people
know
of
that
pious
and
gentle
lady
a
few
words
among
the
cottagers
whom
her
bounty
was
accustomed
to
relieve
a
little
talk
from
house
to
house
at
clavering
where
this
lady
told
how
their
neighbour
died
of
a
complaint
in
the
heart
whilst
that
speculated
upon
the
amount
of
a
property
which
the
widow
had
left
and
a
third
wondered
whether
arthur
would
let
fairoaks
or
live
in
it
and
expected
that
he
would
not
be
long
getting
through
his
property
this
was
all
and
except
with
one
or
two
who
cherished
her
the
kind
soul
was
forgotten
by
the
next
would
you
desire
that
grief
for
you
should
last
for
a
few
more
weeks
and
does
seem
less
solitary
provided
that
our
names
when
we
go
down
into
silence
are
echoing
on
this
side
of
the
grave
yet
for
a
little
while
and
human
voices
are
still
talking
about
us
she
was
gone
the
pure
soul
whom
only
two
or
three
loved
and
knew
the
great
blank
she
left
was
in
laura
heart
to
whom
her
love
had
been
everything
and
who
had
now
but
to
worship
her
memory
i
am
glad
that
she
gave
me
her
blessing
before
she
went
away
warrington
said
to
pen
and
as
for
arthur
with
a
humble
acknowledgment
and
wonder
at
so
much
affection
he
hardly
dared
to
ask
of
heaven
to
make
him
worthy
of
it
though
he
felt
that
a
saint
there
was
interceding
for
him
all
the
lady
affairs
were
found
in
perfect
order
and
her
little
property
ready
for
transmission
to
her
son
in
trust
for
whom
she
held
it
papers
in
her
desk
showed
that
she
had
long
been
aware
of
the
complaint
one
of
the
heart
under
which
she
laboured
and
knew
that
it
would
suddenly
remove
her
and
a
prayer
was
found
in
her
handwriting
asking
that
her
end
might
be
as
it
was
in
the
arms
of
her
son
laura
and
arthur
talked
over
her
sayings
all
of
which
the
former
most
fondly
remembered
to
the
young
man
shame
somewhat
who
thought
how
much
greater
her
love
had
been
for
helen
than
his
own
he
referred
himself
entirely
to
laura
to
know
what
helen
would
have
wished
should
be
done
what
poor
persons
she
would
have
liked
to
relieve
what
legacies
or
remembrances
she
would
have
wished
to
transmit
they
packed
up
the
vase
which
helen
in
her
gratitude
had
destined
to
goodenough
and
duly
sent
it
to
the
kind
doctor
a
silver
which
she
used
was
sent
off
to
portman
a
diamond
ring
with
her
hair
was
given
with
affectionate
greeting
to
warrington
it
must
have
been
a
hard
day
for
poor
laura
when
she
went
over
to
fairoaks
first
and
to
the
little
room
which
she
had
occupied
and
which
was
hers
no
more
and
to
the
widow
own
blank
chamber
in
which
those
two
had
passed
so
many
beloved
hours
there
of
course
were
the
clothes
in
the
wardrobe
the
cushion
on
which
she
prayed
the
chair
at
the
toilette
the
glass
that
was
no
more
to
reflect
her
dear
sad
face
after
she
had
been
here
a
while
pen
knocked
and
led
her
downstairs
to
the
parlour
again
and
made
her
drink
a
little
wine
and
said
god
bless
you
as
she
touched
the
glass
nothing
shall
ever
be
changed
in
your
room
he
said
it
is
always
your
room
it
is
always
my
sister
room
shall
it
not
be
so
laura
and
laura
said
yes
among
the
widow
papers
was
found
a
packet
marked
by
the
widow
letters
from
laura
father
and
which
arthur
gave
to
her
they
were
the
letters
which
had
passed
between
the
cousins
in
the
early
days
before
the
marriage
of
either
of
them
the
ink
was
faded
in
which
they
were
written
the
tears
dried
out
that
both
perhaps
had
shed
over
them
the
grief
healed
now
whose
bitterness
they
chronicled
the
friends
doubtless
united
whose
parting
on
earth
had
caused
to
both
pangs
so
cruel
and
laura
learned
fully
now
for
the
first
time
what
the
tie
was
which
had
bound
her
so
tenderly
to
helen
how
faithfully
her
more
than
mother
had
cherished
her
father
memory
how
truly
she
had
loved
him
how
meekly
resigned
him
one
legacy
of
his
mother
pen
remembered
of
which
laura
could
have
no
cognisance
it
was
that
wish
of
helen
to
make
some
present
to
fanny
bolton
and
pen
wrote
to
her
putting
his
letter
under
an
envelope
to
bows
and
requesting
that
gentleman
to
read
it
before
he
delivered
it
to
fanny
dear
fanny
pen
said
i
have
to
acknowledge
two
letters
from
you
one
of
which
was
delayed
in
my
illness
pen
found
the
first
letter
in
his
mother
desk
after
her
decease
and
the
reading
it
gave
him
a
strange
pang
and
to
thank
you
my
kind
nurse
and
friend
who
watched
me
so
tenderly
during
my
fever
and
i
have
to
tell
you
that
the
last
words
of
my
dear
mother
who
is
no
more
were
words
of
goodwill
and
gratitude
to
you
for
nursing
me
and
she
said
she
would
have
written
to
you
had
she
had
time
that
she
would
like
to
ask
your
pardon
if
she
had
harshly
treated
you
and
that
she
would
beg
you
to
show
your
forgiveness
by
accepting
some
token
of
friendship
and
regard
from
pen
concluded
by
saying
that
his
friend
george
warrington
of
lamb
court
temple
was
trustee
of
a
little
sum
of
money
of
which
the
interest
would
be
paid
to
her
until
she
became
of
age
or
changed
her
name
which
would
always
be
affectionately
remembered
by
her
grateful
friend
pendennis
the
sum
was
in
truth
but
small
although
enough
to
make
a
little
heiress
of
fanny
bolton
whose
parents
were
appeased
and
whose
father
said
had
acted
quite
as
the
gentleman
though
bows
growled
out
that
that
to
plaster
a
wounded
heart
with
a
banknote
was
an
easy
kind
of
sympathy
and
poor
fanny
felt
only
too
clearly
that
letter
was
one
of
farewell
sending
notes
to
porters
daughters
is
all
well
old
major
pendennis
said
to
his
nephew
whom
as
the
proprietor
of
fairoaks
and
the
head
of
the
family
he
now
treated
with
marked
deference
and
civility
and
as
there
was
a
little
ready
money
at
the
bank
and
your
poor
mother
wished
it
there
perhaps
no
harm
done
but
my
good
lad
i
have
you
to
remember
that
you
not
above
five
hundred
a
year
though
thanks
to
me
the
world
gives
you
credit
for
being
a
doosid
deal
better
off
and
on
my
knees
i
beg
you
my
boy
do
break
into
your
capital
stick
to
it
sir
do
speculate
with
it
sir
keep
your
land
and
do
borrow
on
it
tatham
tells
me
that
the
chatteris
branch
of
the
railway
may
will
almost
certainly
pass
through
chatteris
and
of
it
can
be
brought
on
this
side
of
the
brawl
sir
and
through
your
fields
they
be
worth
a
deal
of
money
and
your
five
hundred
a
year
will
jump
up
to
eight
or
nine
whatever
it
is
keep
it
i
implore
you
keep
it
and
i
say
pen
i
think
you
should
give
up
living
in
those
dirty
chambers
in
the
temple
and
let
a
decent
lodging
and
i
should
have
a
man
sir
to
wait
upon
me
and
a
horse
or
two
in
town
in
the
season
all
this
will
pretty
well
swallow
up
your
income
and
i
know
you
must
live
close
but
remember
you
have
a
certain
place
in
society
and
you
ca
afford
to
cut
a
poor
figure
in
the
world
what
are
you
going
to
do
in
the
winter
you
do
intend
to
stay
down
here
or
i
suppose
to
go
on
writing
for
that
d
that
newspaper
warrington
and
i
are
going
abroad
again
sir
for
a
little
and
then
we
shall
see
what
is
to
be
done
arthur
replied
and
you
let
fairoaks
of
course
good
school
in
the
neighbourhood
cheap
country
nice
place
for
east
india
colonels
or
families
wanting
to
retire
i
speak
about
it
at
the
club
there
are
lots
of
fellows
at
the
club
want
a
place
of
that
i
hope

wished
that

not

to
interfere
with
the
arrangements
of

and
that
she
would
mope
herself
to
death
alone
in
that
place
indeed
it
would
have
been
a
very
dismal
abode
for
poor
laura
who
was
not
too
happy
either
in
portman
household
and
in
the
town
where
too
many
things
reminded
her
of
the
dear
parent
whom
she
had
lost
but
old
lady
rockminster
who
adored
her
young
friend
laura
as
soon
as
she
read
in
the
paper
of
her
loss
and
of
her
presence
in
the
country
rushed
over
from
baymouth
where
the
old
lady
was
staying
and
insisted
that
laura

remain

lix
old
friends
it
chanced
at
that
great
english
festival
at
which
all
london
takes
a
holiday
upon
epsom
downs
that
a
great
number
of
the
personages
to
whom
we
have
been
introduced
in
the
course
of
this
history
were
assembled
to
see
the
derby
in
a
comfortable
open
carriage
which
had
been
brought
to
the
ground
by
a
pair
of
horses
might
be
seen
bungay
of
paternoster
row
attired
like
solomon
in
all
his
glory
and
having
by
her
side
modest
shandon
for
whom
since
the
commencement
of
their
acquaintance
the
worthy
publisher
lady
had
maintained
a
steady
friendship
bungay
having
recreated
himself
with
a
copious
luncheon
was
madly
shying
at
the
sticks
hard
by
till
the
perspiration
ran
off
his
bald
pate
shandon
was
shambling
about
among
the
drinking
tenants
and
gipsies
finucane
constant
in
attendance
on
the
two
ladies
to
whom
gentlemen
of
their
acquaintance
and
connected
with
the
publishing
house
came
up
to
pay
a
visit
among
others
archer
came
up
to
make
her
his
bow
and
told
bungay
who
was
on
the
course
yonder
was
the
prime
minister
his
lordship
had
just
told
him
to
back
borax
for
the
race
but
archer
thought
munmeer
the
better
horse
he
pointed
out
countless
dukes
and
grandees
to
the
delighted
bungay
look
yonder
in
the
grand
stand
he
said
there
sits
the
chinese
ambassador
with
the
mandarins
of
his
suite
brought
me
over
letters
of
introduction
from
the
of
india
my
most
intimate
friend
and
i
was
for
some
time
very
kind
to
him
and
he
had
his
chopsticks
laid
for
him
at
my
table
whenever
he
chose
to
come
and
dine
but
he
brought
his
own
cook
with
him
and
would
you
believe
it
mrs
bungay
one
day
when
i
was
out
and
the
ambassador
was
with
archer
in
our
garden
eating
gooseberries
of
which
the
chinese
are
passionately
fond
the
beast
of
a
cook
seeing
my
wife
dear
little
blenheim
spaniel
that
we
had
from
the
duke
of
marlborough
himself
whose
ancestor
life
saved
at
the
battle
of
malplaquet
seized
upon
the
poor
little
devil
cut
his
throat
and
skinned
him
and
served
him
up
stuffed
with
in
the
second
law
said
bungay
you
may
fancy
my
wife
agony
when
she
knew
what
had
happened
the
cook
came
screaming
upstairs
and
told
us
that
she
had
found
poor
fido
skin
in
the
area
just
after
we
had
all
of
us
tasted
of
the
dish
she
never
would
speak
to
the
ambassador
again
never
and
upon
my
word
he
has
never
been
to
dine
with
us
since
the
lord
mayor
who
did
me
the
honour
to
dine
liked
the
dish
very
much
and
eaten
with
green
peas
it
tastes
rather
like
you
do
say
so
now
cried
the
astonished
publisher
lady
fact
upon
my
word
look
at
that
lady
in
blue
seated
by
the
ambassador
that
is
lady
flamingo
and
they
say
she
is
going
to
be
married
to
him
and
return
to
pekin
with
his
excellency
she
is
getting
her
feet
squeezed
down
on
purpose
but
she
only
cripple
herself
and
will
never
be
able
to
do
it
never
my
wife
has
the
smallest
foot
in
england
and
wears
shoes
for
a
child
but
what
is
that
to
a
chinese
lady
foot
bungay
who
is
that
carriage
as
pendennis
is
with
archer
bungay
presently
asked
he
and
warrington

in
his
manners

mr
cried
the
lady
of
paternoster
row
i
happen
to
know
because
i
was
called
in
about
poor
will
archer
replied
pendennis
uncle
the
major
seldom
does
anything
without
me
and
as
he
is
likely
to
be
extravagant
we
tied
up
the
property
so
that
he
ca
make
ducks
and
drakes
with
how
do
you
do
my
lord
do
you
know
that
gentleman
ladies
you
have
read
his
speeches
in
the
house
it

lord
fiddlestick

from
the
box
sure
it
tom
staples
of
the
morning
advertiser
is
it
archer
said
simply
well
i
very
and
upon
my
word
i
thought
it
was
rochester
that
gentleman
with
the
double
another
nod
is
lord
john
and
the
tall
man
with
him
you
know
him
is
sir
you
know
because
you
see
in
the
house
growled
finucane
i
know
them
because
they
are
kind
enough
to
allow
me
to
call
them
my
most
intimate
friends
archer
continued
look
at
the
duke
of
hampshire
what
a
pattern
of
a
fine
old
english
gentleman
he
never
misses
derby
he
said
to
me
only
yesterday
have
been
at
derbies
appeared
on
the
field
for
the
first
time
on
a
piebald
pony
when
i
was
seven
years
old
with
my
father
the
prince
of
wales
and
colonel
hanger
and
only
missing
two
races
one
when
i
had
the
measles
at
eton
and
one
in
the
waterloo
year
when
i
was
with
my
friend
wellington
in
and
who
is
that
yellow
carriage
with
the
pink
and
yellow
parasols
that
pendennis
is
talking
to
and
ever
so
many
gentlemen
asked
bungay
that
is
lady
clavering
of
clavering
park
next
estate
to
my
friend
pendennis
that
is
the
young
son
and
heir
upon
the
box
he
awfully
tipsy
the
little
scamp
and
the
young
lady
is
miss
amory
lady
clavering
daughter
by
a
first
marriage
and
uncommonly
sweet
upon
my
friend
pendennis
but
i
reason
to
think
he
has
his
heart
fixed
elsewhere
you
have
heard
of
young
foker
the
great
brewer
foker
you
know
he
was
going
to
hang
himself
in
consequence
of
a
fatal
passion
for
miss
amory
who
refused
him
but
was
cut
down
just
in
time
by
his
valet
and
is
now
abroad
under
a
how
happy
that
young
fellow
is
sighed
bungay
who
have
thought
when
he
came
so
quiet
and
demure
to
dine
with
us
three
or
four
years
ago
he
would
turn
out
such
a
grand
character
why
i
saw
his
name
at
court
the
other
day
and
presented
by
the
marquis
of
steyne
and
all
and
in
every
party
of
the
nobility
his
name
down
as
sure
as
a
i
introduced
him
a
good
deal
when
he
first
came
up
to
town
archer
said
and
his
uncle
major
pendennis
did
the
rest
hallo
cobden
here
of
all
men
in
the
world
i
must
go
and
speak
to
him
bungay
good
morning
an
hour
previous
to
this
time
and
at
a
different
part
of
the
course
there
might
have
been
seen
an
old
on
the
battered
roof
of
which
a
crowd
of
shabby
raffs
were
stamping
and
hallooing
as
the
great
event
of
the
day
the
derby
race
rushed
over
the
greensward
and
by
the
shouting
millions
of
people
assembled
to
view
that
magnificent
scene
this
was
wheeler
the
harlequin
head
drag
which
had
brought
down
a
company
of
choice
spirits
from
bow
street
with
a
luncheon
in
the
boot
as
the
whirling
race
flashed
by
each
of
the
choice
spirits
bellowed
out
the
name
of
the
horse
or
the
colours
which
he
thought
or
he
hoped
might
be
foremost
the
cornet
it
muffineer
it
blue
sleeves
yallow
cap
yallow
cap
yallow
cap
and
so
forth
yelled
the
gentlemen
sportsmen
during
that
delicious
and
thrilling
minute
before
the
contest
was
decided
and
as
the
fluttering
signal
blew
out
showing
the
number
of
the
famous
horse
podasokus
as
winner
of
the
race
one
of
the
gentlemen
on
the
harlequin
head
drag
sprang
up
off
the
roof
as
if
he
was
a
pigeon
and
about
to
fly
away
to
london
or
york
with
the
news
but
his
elation
did
not
lift
him
many
inches
from
his
to
which
he
came
down
again
on
the
instant
causing
the
boards
of
the
crazy
old
to
crack
with
the
weight
of
his
joy
hurray
hurray
he
bawled
out
podasokus
is
the
horse
supper
for
ten
wheeler
my
boy
ask
you
all
round
of
course
and
damn
the
and
the
gentlemen
on
the
carriage
the
shabby
swaggerers
the
dubious
bucks
said
thank
you
congratulate
you
colonel
sup
with
you
with
pleasure
and
whispered
to
one
another
the
colonel
stands
to
win
fifteen
hundred
and
he
got
the
odds
from
a
good
man
and
each
of
the
shabby
bucks
and
dusky
dandies
began
to
eye
his
neighbour
with
suspicion
lest
that
neighbour
taking
his
advantage
should
get
the
colonel
into
a
lonely
place
and
borrow
money
of
him
and
the
winner
on
podasokus
could
not
be
alone
during
the
whole
of
that
afternoon
so
closely
did
his
friends
watch
him
and
each
other
at
another
part
of
the
course
you
might
have
seen
a
vehicle
certainly
more
modest
if
not
more
shabby
than
that
battered
coach
which
had
brought
down
the
choice
spirits
from
the
harlequin
head
this
was
cab
no
which
had
conveyed
a
gentleman
and
two
ladies
from
the
cabstand
in
the
strand
whereof
one
of
the
ladies
as
she
sate
on
the
box
of
the
cab
enjoying
with
her
mamma
and
their
companion
a
repast
of
lobster
salad
and
bitter
ale
looked
so
fresh
and
pretty
that
many
of
the
splendid
young
dandies
who
were
strolling
about
the
course
and
enjoying
themselves
at
the
noble
diversion
of
sticks
and
talking
to
the
beautifully
dressed
ladies
in
the
beautiful
carriages
on
the
hill
forsook
these
fascinations
to
have
a
glance
at
the
smiling
and
lass
on
the
cab
the
blushes
of
youth
and
mantled
on
the
girl
cheeks
and
played
over
that
fair
countenance
like
the
pretty
shining
cloudlets
on
the
serene
sky
overhead
the
elder
lady
cheek
was
red
too
but
that
was
a
permanent
mottled
rose
deepening
only
as
it
received
free
draughts
of
pale
ale
and
until
her
face
emulated
the
rich
shell
of
the
lobster
which
she
devoured
the
gentleman
who
escorted
these
two
ladies
was
most
active
in
attendance
upon
them
here
on
the
course
as
he
had
been
during
the
previous
journey
during
the
whole
of
that
animated
and
delightful
drive
from
london
his
jokes
had
never
ceased
he
spoke
up
undauntedly
to
the
most
awful
drags
full
of
the
biggest
and
most
solemn
guardsmen
as
to
the
humblest
in
which
bob
the
dustman
was
driving
molly
to
the
race
he
had
fired
astonishing
volleys
of
what
is
called
chaff
into
endless
windows
as
he
passed
into
lines
of
grinning
schools
into
little
regiments
of
shouting
urchins
hurraying
behind
the
railings
of
their
classical
and
commercial
academies
into
casements
whence
smiling
and
nurses
tossing
babies
or
demure
old
maiden
ladies
with
dissenting
countenances
were
looking
and
the
pretty
girl
in
the
straw
bonnet
with
pink
ribbon
and
her
mamma
the
devourer
of
lobsters
had
both
agreed
that
when
he
was
in
spirits
there
was
nothing
like
that
sam
he
had
crammed
the
cab
with
trophies
won
from
the
bankrupt
proprietors
of
the
sticks
hard
by
and
with
countless
pincushions
wooden
apples
and
little
soldiers
he
had
brought
up
a
gipsy
with
a
tawny
child
in
her
arms
to
tell
the
fortunes
of
the
ladies
and
the
only
cloud
which
momentarily
obscured
the
sunshine
of
that
happy
party
was
when
the
teller
of
fate
informed
the
young
lady
that
had
had
reason
to
beware
of
a
fair
man
who
was
false
to
her
that
she
had
had
a
bad
illness
and
that
she
would
find
that
a
man
would
prove
true
the
girl
looked
very
much
abashed
at
this
news
her
mother
and
the
young
man
interchanged
signs
of
wonder
and
intelligence
perhaps
the
conjurer
had
used
the
same
words
to
a
hundred
different
carriages
on
that
day
making
his
way
solitary
amongst
the
crowd
and
the
carriages
and
noting
according
to
his
wont
the
various
circumstances
and
characters
which
the
animated
scene
presented
a
young
friend
of
ours
came
suddenly
upon
cab
and
the
little
group
of
persons
assembled
on
the
outside
of
the
vehicle
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
young
lady
on
the
box
she
started
and
turned
pale
her
mother
became
redder
than
ever
the
heretofore
gay
and
triumphant
sam
immediately
assumed
a
fierce
and
suspicious
look
and
his
eyes
turned
savagely
from
fanny
bolton
whom
the
reader
no
doubt
has
recognised
in
the
young
lady
of
the
cab
to
arthur
pendennis
advancing
to
meet
her
arthur
too
looked
dark
and
suspicious
on
perceiving
samuel
huxter
in
company
with
his
old
acquaintances
his
suspicion
was
that
of
alarmed
morality
and
i
dare
say
highly
creditable
to
arthur
like
the
suspicion
of
lynx
when
she
sees
brown
and
jones
talking
together
or
when
she
remarks
lamb
twice
or
thrice
in
a
handsome
there
may
be
no
harm
in
the
conversation
of
and
and
lamb
though
she
notoriously
ca
afford
one
may
be
honestly
come
by
but
yet
a
moralist
like
lynx
has
a
right
to
the
little
precautionary
fright
and
arthur
was
no
doubt
justified
in
adopting
that
severe
demeanour
of
his
fanny
heart
began
to
patter
violently
huxter
fists
plunged
into
the
pockets
of
his
paletot
clenched
themselves
involuntarily
and
armed
themselves
as
it
were
in
ambush
bolton
began
to
talk
with
all
her
might
and
with
a
wonderful
volubility
and
lor
she
was
so
to
see
pendennis
and
how
well
he
was
and
we
been
talking
about
only
jest
before
had
we
fanny
and
if
this
was
the
famous
epsom
races
that
they
talked
so
much
about
she
care
for
her
part
if
she
never
saw
them
again
and
how
was
major
pendennis
and
that
kind
warrington
who
brought
great
kindness
to
fanny
and
she
never
would
forget
it
never
and
warrington
was
so
tall
he
almost
broke
his
up
against
their
lodge
door
you
recollect
warrington
of
his
head
do
you
fanny
whilst
bolton
was
so
discoursing
i
wonder
how
many
thousands
of
thoughts
passed
through
fanny
mind
and
what
dear
times
sad
struggles
lonely
griefs
and
subsequent
shamefaced
consolations
were
recalled
to
her
what
pangs
had
the
poor
little
thing
as
she
thought
how
much
she
had
loved
him
and
that
she
loved
him
no
more
there
he
stood
about
whom
she
was
going
to
die
ten
months
since
dandified
supercilious
with
a
black
crape
to
his
white
hat
and
jet
buttons
in
his
and
a
pink
in
his
coat
that
some
one
else
had
probably
given
him
with
the
tightest
gloves
sewn
with
black
and
the
smallest
of
canes
and
huxter
wore
no
gloves
and
great
blucher
boots
and
smelt
very
much
of
tobacco
certainly
and
looked
oh
it
must
be
owned
he
looked
as
if
a
bucket
of
water
would
do
him
a
great
deal
of
good
all
these
thoughts
and
a
myriad
of
others
rushed
through
fanny
mind
as
her
mamma
was
delivering
herself
of
her
speech
and
as
the
girl
from
under
her
eyes
surveyed
pendennis
surveyed
him
entirely
from
head
to
foot
the
circle
on
his
white
forehead
that
his
hat
left
when
he
lifted
it
his
beautiful
beautiful
hair
had
grown
again
the
trinkets
at
his
the
ring
on
his
hand
under
his
glove
the
neat
shining
boot
so
so
unlike
sam
and
after
her
hand
had
given
a
little
twittering
pressure
to
the
kid
grasp
which
was
held
out
to
it
and
after
her
mother
had
delivered
herself
of
her
speech
all
fanny
could
find
to
say
was
this
is
samuel
huxter
whom
you
knew
formerly
i
believe
sir
samuel
you
know
you
knew
pendennis
formerly
and
and
will
you
take
a
little
refreshment
these
little
words
tremulous
and
uncoloured
as
they
were
yet
were
understood
by
pendennis
in
such
a
manner
as
to
take
a
great
load
of
suspicion
from
off
his
mind
of
remorse
perhaps
from
his
heart
the
frown
on
the
countenance
of
the
prince
of
fairoaks
disappeared
and
a
smile
and
a
knowing
twinkle
of
the
eyes
illuminated
his
highness
countenance
i
am
very
thirsty
he
said
and
i
will
be
glad
to
drink
your
health
fanny
and
i
hope
huxter
will
pardon
me
for
having
been
very
rude
to
him
the
last
time
we
met
and
when
i
was
so
ill
and
out
of
spirits
that
indeed
i
scarcely
knew
what
i
and
herewith
the
dexter
was
handed
out
in
token
of
amity
to
huxter
the
dirty
fist
in
the
young
surgeon
pocket
was
obliged
to
undoable
itself
and
come
out
of
its
ambush
disarmed
the
poor
fellow
himself
felt
as
he
laid
it
in
pen
hand
how
hot
his
own
was
and
how
black
it
left
black
marks
on
pen
gloves
he
saw
them
he
would
have
liked
to
have
clenched
it
again
and
dashed
it
into
the
face
and
have
seen
there
upon
that
round
with
fanny
with
all
england
looking
on
which
was
the
best
man
he
sam
huxter
of
bartholomew
or
that
grinning
dandy
pen
with
ineffable
took
a
glass
he
did
mind
what
it
was
he
was
content
to
drink
after
the
ladies
and
he
filled
it
with
frothing
lukewarm
beer
which
he
pronounced
to
be
delicious
and
which
he
drank
cordially
to
the
health
of
the
party
as
he
was
drinking
and
talking
on
in
an
engaging
manner
a
young
lady
in
a
shot
dress
with
a
white
parasol
lined
with
pink
and
the
prettiest
boots
that
ever
stepped
passed
by
pen
leaning
on
the
arm
of
a
stalwart
gentleman
with
a
military
moustache
the
young
lady
clenched
her
little
fist
and
gave
a
mischievous
as
she
passed
pen
he
of
the
mustachios
burst
out
into
a
jolly
laugh
he
had
taken
off
his
hat
to
the
ladies
of
cab
no
you
should
have
seen
fanny
bolton
eyes
watching
after
the
young
lady
immediately
huxter
perceived
the
direction
which
they
took
they
ceased
looking
after
the
nymph
and
they
turned
and
looked
into
sam
huxter
orbs
with
the
most
artless
expression
what
a
beautiful
creature
fanny
said
what
a
lovely
dress
did
you
remark
sam
such
little
little
hands
it
was
capting
strong
said
bolton
and
who
was
the
young
woman
i
wonder
a
neighbour
of
mine
in
the
country
miss
arthur
said
lady
clavering
daughter
you
seen
sir
francis
often
in
shepherd
inn
as
he
spoke
fanny
built
up
a
perfect
romance
in
three
volumes
love
faithlessness
splendid
marriage
at
george
hanover
square
maid
and
sam
huxter
was
not
the
hero
of
that
story
poor
sam
who
by
this
time
had
got
out
an
exceedingly
rank
cuba
cigar
and
was
smoking
it
under
fanny
little
nose
after
that
confounded
prig
pendennis
joined
and
left
the
party
the
sun
was
less
bright
to
sam
huxter
the
sky
less
blue
the
sticks
had
no
attraction
for
him
the
bitter
beer
hot
and
undrinkable
the
world
was
changed
he
had
a
quantity
of
peas
and
a
tin
in
the
pocket
of
the
cab
for
amusement
on
the
homeward
route
he
did
take
them
out
and
forgot
their
existence
until
some
other
wag
on
their
return
from
the
races
fired
a
volley
into
sam
sad
face
upon
which
salute
after
a
few
oaths
indicative
of
surprise
he
burst
into
a
savage
and
sardonic
laugh
but
fanny
was
charming
all
the
way
home
she
coaxed
and
snuggled
and
smiled
she
laughed
pretty
laughs
she
admired
everything
she
took
out
the
darling
little
and
was
so
obliged
to
sam
and
when
they
got
home
and
huxter
still
with
darkness
on
his
countenance
was
taking
a
frigid
leave
of
her
she
burst
into
tears
and
said
he
was
a
naughty
unkind
thing
upon
which
with
a
burst
of
emotion
almost
as
emphatic
as
hers
the
young
surgeon
held
the
girl
in
his
arms
swore
that
she
was
an
angel
and
that
he
was
a
jealous
brute
owned
that
he
was
unworthy
of
her
and
that
he
had
no
right
to
hate
pendennis
and
asked
her
implored
her
to
say
once
more
that
she
that
she
what
the
end
of
the
question
and
fanny
answer
were
pronounced
by
lips
that
were
so
near
each
other
that
no
bystander
could
hear
the
words
bolton
only
said
come
come
no
nonsense
if
you
please
and
i
think
you
acted
like
a
wicked
wretch
and
been
most
uncommon
cruel
to
fanny
that
i
when
arthur
left
no
he
went
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
carriage
to
which
and
to
the
side
of
her
mamma
the
author
of
mes
larmes
had
by
this
time
returned
indefatigable
old
major
pendennis
was
in
waiting
upon
lady
clavering
and
had
occupied
the
back
seat
in
her
carriage
the
box
being
in
possession
of
young
hopeful
under
the
care
of
captain
strong
a
number
of
dandies
and
men
of
a
certain
fashion
of
military
bucks
of
young
rakes
of
the
public
offices
of
those
who
may
be
styled
men
men
rather
than
ladies
had
come
about
the
carriage
during
its
station
on
the
hill
and
had
exchanged
a
word
or
two
with
lady
clavering
and
a
little
talk
a
little
chaff
some
of
the
most
elegant
of
the
men
styled
their
conversation
with
miss
amory
they
had
offered
her
sportive
bets
and
exchanged
with
her
all
sorts
of
and
knowing
innuendoes
they
pointed
out
to
her
who
was
on
the
course
and
the
who
was
not
always
the
person
a
young
lady
should
know
when
pen
came
up
to
lady
clavering
carriage
he
had
to
push
his
way
through
a
crowd
of
these
young
bucks
who
were
paying
their
court
to
miss
amory
in
order
to
arrive
as
near
that
young
lady
who
beckoned
him
by
many
pretty
signals
to
her
side
je
lay

she
said
elle
a
de
bien
beaux

vous
etes
un
monster
why
monster
said

with
a
laugh

my
young
friend
yonder
is
as
well
protected
as
any
young
lady
in
christendom
she
has
her
mamma
on
one
side
her
pretend
on
the
other
could
any
harm
happen
to
a
girl
between
those
two
one
does
not
know
what
may
or
may
not
arrive
said
miss
blanche
in
french
when
a
girl
has
the
mind
and
when
she
is
pursued
by
a
wicked
monster
like
you
figure
to
yourself
major
that
i
come
to
find
monsieur
your
nephew
near
to
a
cab
by
two
ladies
and
a
man
oh
such
a
man
and
who
ate
lobsters
and
who
laughed
who
laughed
it
did
not
strike
me
that
the
man
laughed
pen
said
and
as
for
lobsters
i
thought
he
would
have
liked
to
eat
me
after
the
lobsters
he
shook
hands
with
me
and
gripped
me
so
that
he
bruised
my
glove
he
is
a
young
surgeon
he
comes
from
clavering
you
remember
the
gilt
pestle
and
mortar
in
high
street

miss
amory

perpetual
recurrence
to
the
word
monster
jarred
upon
pen
she
speaks
about
these
matters
a
great
deal
too
lightly
he
thought
if
i
had
been
a
monster
as
she
calls
it
she
would
have
received
me
just
the
same
this
is
not
the
way
in
which
an
english
lady
should
speak
or
think
laura

not
speak
in
that
way
thank
god
and
as
he

a
pretty
good
one
on
the
derby
what
a
flat
clavering
is
and
the
begum
i
like
that
old
begum
worth
ten
of
her
daughter
how
pleased
the
old
girl

at
winning
the
lottery
clavering
safe
to
pay
up
ai
he
asked
captain
crackenbury
i
hope
so
said
his
friend
and
they
disappeared
to
enjoy
themselves
among
the
sticks
before
the
end
of
the
day
amusements
many
more
gentlemen
of
lady
clavering
acquaintance
came
up
to
her
carriage
and
chatted
with
the
party
which
it
contained
the
worthy
lady
was
in
high
spirits
and
laughing
and
talking
according
to
her
wont
and
offering
refreshments
to
all
her
friends
until
her
ample
baskets
and
bottles
were
emptied
and
her
servants
and
postillions
were
in
such
a
royal
state
of
excitement
as
servants
and
postillions
commonly
are
upon
the
derby
day
the
major
remarked
that
some
of
the
visitors
to
the
carriage
appeared
to
look
with
rather
queer
and
meaning
glances
towards
its
owner
how
easily
she
takes
it
one
man
whispered
to
another
the
begum
made
of
money
the
friend
replied
how
easily
she
takes
what
thought
old
pendennis
has
anybody
lost
any
money
lady
clavering
said
she
was
happy
in
the
morning
because
sir
francis
had
promised
her
not
to
bet
welbore
the
country
neighbour
of
the
claverings
was
passing
the
carriage
when
he
was
called
back
by
the
begum
who
rallied
him
for
wishing
to
cut
her
why
did
he
come
before
why
did
he
come
to
lunch
her
ladyship
was
in
great
delight
she
told
him
she
told
everybody
that
she
had
won
five
pounds
in
a
lottery
as
she
conveyed
this
piece
of
intelligence
to
him
welbore
looked
so
particularly
knowing
and
withal
melancholy
that
a
dismal
apprehension
seized
upon
major
pendennis
he
would
go
and
look
after
the
horses
and
those
rascals
of
postillions
who
were
so
long
in
coming
when
he
came
back
to
the
carriage
his
usually
benign
and
smirking
countenance
was
obscured
by
some
sorrow
what
is
the
matter
with
you
now
the
begum
asked
the
major
pretended
a
headache
from
the
fatigue
and
sunshine
of
the
day
the
carriage
wheeled
off
the
course
and
took
its
way
londonwards
not
the
least
brilliant
equipage
in
that
vast
and
picturesque
procession
the
tipsy
drivers
dashed
gallantly
over
the
turf
amidst
the
admiration
of
the
ironical
cheers
of
the
little
and
spring
vans
and
the
loud
objurgations
of
men
with
whom
the
reckless
came
in
contact
the
jolly
begum
looked
the
picture
of
as
she
reclined
on
her
splendid
cushions
the
lovely
sylphide
smiled
with
languid
elegance
many
an
honest
with
his
family
wadded
into
a
many
a
cheap
dandy
working
his
way
home
on
his
weary
hack
admired
that
brilliant
and
thought
no
doubt
how
happy
those
swells
must
be
strong
sat
on
the
box
still
with
a
lordly
voice
calling
to
the
and
the
crowd
master
frank
had
been
put
inside
of
the
carriage
and
was
asleep
there
by
the
side
of
the
major
dozing
away
the
effects
of
the
constant
luncheon
and
champagne
of
which
he
had
freely
partaken
the
major
was
revolving
in
his
mind
meanwhile
the
news
the
receipt
of
which
had
made
him
so
grave
if
sir
francis
clavering
goes
on
in
this
way
pendennis
the
elder
thought
this
little
tipsy
rascal
will
be
as
bankrupt
as
his
father
and
grandfather
before
him
the
begum
fortune
ca
stand
such
drains
upon
it
no
fortune
can
stand
them
she
has
paid
his
debts
half
a
dozen
times
already
a
few
years
more
of
the
turf
and
a
few
coups
like
this
will
ruin
do
you
think
we
could
get
up
races
at
clavering
mamma
miss
amory
asked
yes

must
have
them
there
again
there
were
races
there
in
the
old
times
the
good
old
times
it
a
national
amusement
you
know
and
we
could
have
a
clavering
ball
and
we
might
have
dances
for
the
tenantry
and
rustic
sports
in
the
park
oh
it
would
be
capital
fun
said
mamma
would
it
major
the
turf
is
a
very
expensive
amusement
my
dear
lady
major
pendennis
answered
with
such
a
rueful
face
that
the
begum
rallied
him
and
asked
laughingly
whether
he
had
lost
money
on
the
race
after
a
slumber
of
about
an
hour
and
a
half
the
heir
of
the
house
began
to
exhibit
symptoms
of
wakefulness
stretching
his
youthful
arms
over
the
major
face
and
kicking
his
sister
knees
as
she
sate
opposite
to
him
when
the
amiable
youth
was
quite
restored
to
consciousness
he
began
a
sprightly
conversation
i
say
ma
he
said

time

expressed
her
desire

me
alone
strong
will
you
captain
strong
captain
strong
is
this
true
cried
out
the
unfortunate
begum
has
sir
francis
been
betting
again
he
promised
me
he
would
he
gave
me
his
word
of
honour
he
strong
from
his
place
on
the
box
had
overheard
the
end
of
young
clavering
communication
and
was
trying
in
vain
to
stop
his
unlucky
tongue
i
afraid
it
true
he
said
turning
round
i
deplore
the
loss
as
much
as
you
can
he
promised
me
as
he
promised
you
but
the
play
is
too
strong
for
him
he
ca
refrain
from
lady
clavering
at
this
sad
news
burst
into
a
fit
of
tears
she
deplored
her
wretched
fate
as
the
most
miserable
of
women
she
declared
she
would
separate
and
pay
no
more
debts
for
the
ungrateful
man
she
narrated
with
tearful
volubility
a
score
of
stories
only
too
authentic
which
showed
how
her
husband
had
deceived
and
how
constantly
she
had
befriended
him
and
in
this
melancholy
condition
whilst
young
hopeful
was
thinking
about
the
two
guineas
which
he
himself
had
won
and
the
major
revolving
in
his
darkened
mind
whether
certain
plans
which
he
had
been
forming
had
better
not
be
abandoned
the
splendid
carriage
drove
up
at
length
to
the
begum
house
in
grosvenor
place
the
idlers
and
boys
lingering
about
the
place
to
witness
according
to
public
wont
the
close
of
the
derby
day
cheering
the
carriage
as
it
drew
up
and
envying
the
happy
folks
who
descended
from
it
and
it
for
the
son
of
this
man
that
i
am
made
a
beggar
blanche
said
quivering
with
anger
as
she
walked
upstairs
leaning
on
the
major
arm
for
this
cheat
for
this
blackleg
for
this
liar
for
this
robber
of
calm
yourself
my
dear
miss
blanche
the
old
gentleman
said
i
pray
calm
yourself
you
have
been
hardly
treated
most
unjustly
but
remember
that
you
have
always
a
friend
in
me
and
trust
to
an
old
fellow
who
will
try
and
serve
and
the
young
lady
and
the
heir
of
the
hopeful
house
of
clavering
having
retired
to
their
beds
the
remaining
three
of
the
epsom
party

for
some
time

chapter
lx
explanations
almost
a
year
as
the
reader
will
perceive
has
passed
since
an
event
described
a
few
pages
back
arthur
black
coat
is
about
to
be
exchanged
for
a
blue
one
his
person
has
undergone
other
more
pleasing
and
remarkable
changes
his
wig
has
been
laid
aside
and
his
hair
though
somewhat
thinner
has
returned
to
public
view
and
he
has
had
the
honour
of
appearing
at
court
in
the
uniform
of
a
cornet
of
the
clavering
troop
of
the
shire
yeomanry
cavalry
being
presented
to
the
sovereign
by
the
marquis
of
steyne
this
was
a
measure
strongly
and
pathetically
urged
by
arthur
uncle
the
major
would
not
hear
of
a
year
passing
before
this
ceremony
of
gentlemanhood
was
gone
through
the
old
gentleman
thought
that
his
nephew
should
belong
to
some
rather
more
select
club
than
the
megatherium
and
has
announced
everywhere
in
the
world
his
disappointment
that
the
young
man
property
has
turned
out
not
by
any
means
as
well
as
he
could
have
hoped
and
is
under
fifteen
hundred
a
year
that
is
the
amount
at
which
pendennis
property
is
set
down
in
the
world
where
his
publishers
begin
to
respect
him
much
more
than
formerly
and
where
even
mammas
are
by
no
means
uncivil
to
him
for
if
the
pretty
daughters
are
naturally
to
marry
people
of
very
different
expectations
at
any
rate
he
will
be
eligible
for
the
plain
ones
and
if
the
brilliant
and
fascinating
myra
is
to
hook
an
earl
poor
little
beatrice
who
has
one
shoulder
higher
than
the
other
must
hang
on
to
some
boor
through
life
and
why
should
not
pendennis
be
her
support
in
the
very
first
winter
after
the
accession
to
his
mother
fortune
hawxby
in
a
caused
her
beatrice
to
learn
billiards
from
pendennis
and
would
be
driven
by
nobody
but
him
in
the
pony
carriage
because
he
was
literary
and
her
beatrice
was
literary
too
and
declared
that
the
young
man
under
the
instigation
of
his
horrid
old
uncle
had
behaved
most
infamously
in
trifling
with
beatrice
feelings
the
truth
is
the
old
gentleman
who
knew
hawxby
character
and
how
desperately
that
lady
would
practise
upon
unwary
young
men
had
come
to
the
in
question
and
carried
arthur
out
of
the
danger
of
her
immediate
claws
though
not
out
of
the
reach
of
her
tongue
the
elder
pendennis
would
have
had
his
nephew
pass
a
part
of
the
christmas
at
clavering
whither
the
family
had
returned
but
arthur
had
not
the
heart
for
that
clavering
was
too
near
poor
old
fairoaks
and
that
was
too
full
of
sad
recollections
for
the
young
man
we
have
lost
sight
of
the
claverings
too
until
their
reappearance
upon
the
epsom
and
must
give
a
brief
account
of
them
in
the
interval
during
the
past
year
the
world
has
not
treated
any
member
of
the
clavering
family
very
kindly
lady
clavering
one
of
the
women
that
ever
enjoyed
a
good
dinner
or
made
a
slip
in
grammar
has
had
her
appetite
and
sadly
tried
by
constant
family
grievances
and
disputes
such
as
make
the
efforts
of
the
best
french
cook
unpalatable
and
the
most
hard
to
lie
on
i
rather
have
a
turnip
strong
for
dessert
than
that
pineapple
and
all
them
muscatel
grapes
from
clavering
says
poor
lady
clavering
looking
at
her
and
confiding
her
grief
to
her
faithful
friend
if
i
could
but
have
a
little
quiet
to
eat
it
with
oh
how
much
happier
i
was
when
i
was
a
widow
and
before
all
this
money
fell
in
to
me
the
clavering
family
had
indeed
made
a
false
start
in
life
and
had
got
neither
conduct
nor
position
nor
thanks
for
the
hospitalities
which
they
administered
nor
a
return
of
kindness
from
the
people
whom
they
entertained
the
success
of
their
first
london
season
was
doubtful
and
their
failure
afterwards
notorious
human
patience
was
not
great
enough
to
put
up
with
sir
francis
clavering
people
said
he
was
too
hopelessly
low
dull
and
disreputable
you
could
not
say
what
but
there
was
a
taint
about
the
house
and
its
entourages
who
was
the
begum
with
her
money
and
without
her
h
and
where
did
she
come
from
what
an
extraordinary
little
piece
of
conceit
the
daughter
was
with
her
gallicised
graces
and
daring
affectations
not
fit
for
english
girls
to
associate
with
what
strange
people
were
those
they
assembled
round
about
them
sir
francis
clavering
was
a
gambler
living
notoriously
in
the
society
of
blacklegs
and
profligates
hely
clinker
who
was
in
his
regiment
said
that
he
not
only
cheated
at
cards
but
showed
the
white
feather
what
could
lady
rockminster
have
meant
by
taking
her
up
after
the
first
season
indeed
lady
rockminster
who
had
taken
up
lady
clavering
put
her
down
the
great
ladies
would
not
take
their
daughters
to
her
parties
the
young
men
who
attended
them
behaved
with
the
most
odious
freedom
and
scornful
familiarity
and
poor
lady
clavering
herself
avowed
that
she
was
obliged
to
take
what
she
called
canal
into
her
parlour
because
the
would
she
had
not
the
slightest
towards
the
canal
the
poor
dear
lady
or
any
pride
about
herself
or
idea
that
she
was
better
than
her
neighbour
but
she
had
taken
implicitly
the
orders
which
on
her
entry
into
the
world
her
social
godmother
had
given
her
she
had
been
willing
to
know
whom
they
knew
and
ask
whom
they
asked
the
canal
in
fact
was
much
pleasanter
than
what
is
called
society
but
as
we
said
before
that
to
leave
a
mistress
is
easy
while
on
the
contrary
to
be
left
by
her
is
cruel
so
you
may
give
up
society
without
any
great
pang
or
anything
but
a
sensation
of
relief
at
the
parting
but
severe
are
the
mortifications
and
pains
you
have
if
society
gives
up
you
one
young
man
of
fashion
we
have
mentioned
who
at
least
it
might
have
been
expected
would
have
been
found
faithful
amongst
the
faithless
and
harry
foker
was
indeed
that
young
man
but
he
had
not
managed
matters
with
prudence
and
the
unhappy
passion
at
first
confided
to
pen
became
notorious
and
ridiculous
to
the
town
was
carried
to
the
ears
of
his
weak
and
fond
mother
and
finally
brought
under
the
cognisance
of
the
and
inflexible
foker
senior
when
foker
learned
this
disagreeable
news
there
took
place
between
him
and
his
son
a
violent
and
painful
scene
which
ended
in
the
poor
little
gentleman
banishment
from
england
for
a
year
with
a
positive
order
to
return
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
and
complete
his
marriage
with
his
cousin
or
to
retire
into
private
life
and
three
hundred
a
year
altogether
and
never
see
parent
or
brewery
more
henry
foker
went
away
then
carrying
with
him
that
grief
and
care
which
passes
free
at
the
strictest
and
which
proverbially
accompanies
the
exile
and
with
this
crape
over
his
eyes
even
the
parisian
boulevard
looked
melancholy
to
him
and
the
sky
of
italy
black
to
sir
francis
clavering
that
year
was
a
most
unfortunate
one
the
events
described
in
the
last
chapter
came
to
complete
the
ruin
of
the
year
it
was
that
year
of
grace
in
which
as
our
sporting
readers
may
remember
lord
harrowhill
horse
he
was
a
classical
young
nobleman
and
named
his
stud
out
of
the
iliad
when
podasokus
won
the
derby
to
the
dismay
of
the
knowing
ones
who
pronounced
the
winning
horse
name
in
various
extraordinary
ways
and
who
backed
borax
who
was
nowhere
in
the
race
sir
francis
clavering
who
was
intimate
with
some
of
the
most
rascally
characters
of
the
turf
and
of
course
had
valuable
information
had
laid
heavy
odds
against
the
winning
horse
and
backed
the
favourite
freely
and
the
result
of
his
dealings
was
as
his
son
correctly
stated
to
poor
lady
clavering
a
loss
of
seven
thousand
pounds
indeed
it
was
a
cruel
blow
upon
the
lady
who
had
discharged
her
husband
debts
many
times
over
who
had
received
as
many
times
his
oaths
and
promises
of
amendment
who
had
paid
his
and
who
had
furnished
his
town
and
country
houses
and
who
was
called
upon
now
instantly
to
meet
this
enormous
sum
the
penalty
of
her
cowardly
husband
extravagance
it
has
been
described
in
former
pages
how
the
elder
pendennis
had
become
the
adviser
of
the
clavering
family
and
in
his
quality
of
intimate
friend
of
the
house
had
gone
over
every
room
of
it
and
even
seen
that
ugly
closet
which
we
all
of
us
have
and
in
which
according
to
the
proverb
the
family
skeleton
is
locked
up
about
the
baronet
pecuniary
matters
if
the
major
did
not
know
it
was
because
clavering
himself
did
not
know
them
and
hid
them
from
himself
and
others
in
such
a
hopeless
entanglement
of
lies
that
it
was
impossible
for
adviser
or
attorney
or
principal
to
get
an
accurate
knowledge
of
his
affairs
but
concerning
lady
clavering
the
major
was
much
better
informed
and
when
the
unlucky
mishap
of
the
derby
arose
he
took
upon
himself
to
become
completely
and
thoroughly
acquainted
with
all
her
means
whatsoever
they
were
and
was
now
accurately
informed
of
the
vast
and
repeated
sacrifices
which
the
widow
amory
had
made
in
behalf
of
her
present
husband
he
did
not
conceal
and
he
had
won
no
small
favour
from
miss
blanche
by
avowing
it
his
opinion
that
lady
clavering
daughter
had
been
hardly
treated
at
the
expense
of
her
son
by
her
second
marriage
and
in
his
conversations
with
lady
clavering
had
fairly
hinted
that
he
thought
miss
blanche
ought
to
have
a
better
provision
we
have
said
that
he
had
already
given
the
widow
to
understand
that
he
knew
all
the
particulars
of
her
early
and
unfortunate
history
having
been
in
india
at
the
time
when
when
the
painful
circumstances
occurred
which
had
ended
in
her
parting
from
her
first
husband
he
could
tell
her
where
to
find
the
calcutta
newspaper
which
contained
the
account
of
amory
trial
and
he
showed
and
the
begum
was
not
a
little
grateful
to
him
for
his
forbearance
how
being
aware
all
along
of
this
mishap
which
had
befallen
her
he
had
kept
all
knowledge
of
it
to
himself
and
been
constantly
the
friend
of
her
family
interested
motives
my
dear
lady
clavering
he
said
of
course
i
may
have
had
we
all
have
interested
motives
and
mine
i
do
conceal
from
you
was
to
make
a
marriage
between
my
nephew
and
your
to
which
lady
clavering
perhaps
with
some
surprise
that
the
major
should
choose
her
family
for
a
union
with
his
own
said
she
was
quite
willing
to
consent
but
frankly
he
said
my
dear
lady
my
boy
has
but
five
hundred
a
year
and
a
wife
with
ten
thousand
pounds
to
her
fortune
would
scarcely
better
him
we
could
do
better
for
him
than
that
permit
me
to
say
and
he
is
a
shrewd
cautious
young
fellow
who
has
sown
his
wild
oats
now
who
has
very
good
parts
and
plenty
of
ambition
and
whose
object
in
marrying
is
to
better
himself
if
you
and
sir
francis
chose
and
sir
francis
take
my
word
for
it
will
refuse
you
nothing
you
could
put
arthur
in
a
way
to
advance
very
considerably
in
the
world
and
show
the
stuff
which
he
has
in
him
of
what
use
is
that
seat
in
parliament
to
clavering
who
scarcely
ever
shows
his
face
in
the
house
or
speaks
a
word
there
told
by
gentlemen
who
heard
my
boy
at
oxbridge
that
he
was
famous
as
an
orator
begad
and
once
put
his
foot
into
the
stirrup
and
mount
him
i
no
doubt
he
wo
be
the
last
of
the
field
i
tested
the
chap
and
know
him
pretty
well
i
think
he
is
much
too
lazy
and
careless
and
flighty
a
fellow
to
make
a
journey
and
arrive
as
your
lawyers
do
at
the
end
of
their
lives
but
give
him
a
start
and
good
friends
and
an
opportunity
and
take
my
word
for
it
he
make
himself
a
name
that
his
sons
shall
be
proud
of
i
do
see
any
way
for
a
fellow
like
him
to
parvenir
but
by
making
a
prudent
marriage
not
with
a
beggarly
heiress
to
sit
down
for
life
upon
a
miserable
fifteen
hundred
a
year
but
with
somebody
whom
he
can
help
and
who
can
help
him
forward
in
the
world
and
whom
he
can
give
a
good
name
and
a
station
in
the
country
begad
in
return
for
the
advantages
which
she
brings
him
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
have
a
distinguished
than
to
keep
your
husband
on
in
parliament
who
of
no
good
to
himself
or
to
anybody
else
there
and
that
i
say
why
i
been
interested
about
you
and
offer
you
what
i
think
a
good
bargain
for
you
know
i
look
upon
arthur
as
one
of
the
family
almost
now
said
the
begum
he
comes
and
goes
when
he
likes
and
the
more
i
think
of
his
dear
mother
the
more
i
see
there
few
people
so
good
none
so
good
to
me
and
i
sure
i
cried
when
i
heard
of
her
death
and
would
have
gone
into
mourning
for
her
myself
only
black
do
become
me
and
i
know
who
his
mother
wanted
him
to
marry
laura
i
mean
whom
old
lady
rockminster
has
taken
such
a
fancy
to
and
no
wonder
she
a
better
girl
than
my
girl
i
know
both
and
my
betsy
blanche
i
mean
ai
been
a
comfort
to
me
major
it
laura
pen
ought
to
marry
marry
on
five
hundred
a
year
my
dear
good
soul
you
are
mad
major
pendennis
said
think
over
what
i
have
said
to
you
do
nothing
in
your
affairs
with
that
unhappy
husband
of
yours
without
consulting
me
and
remember
that
old
pendennis
is
always
your
for
some
time
previous
pen
uncle
had
held
similar
language
to
miss
amory
he
had
pointed
out
to
her
the
convenience
of
the
match
which
he
had
at
heart
and
was
bound
to
say
that
mutual
convenience
was
of
all
things
the
very
best
in
the
world
to
marry
upon
the
only
thing
look
at
your
my
dear
young
creature
the
people
are
the
most
notorious
of
all
for
quarrelling
afterwards
and
a
girl
who
runs
away
with
jack
to
gretna
green
constantly
runs
away
with
tom
to
switzerland
afterwards
the
great
point
in
marriage
is
for
people
to
agree
to
be
useful
to
one
another
the
lady
brings
the
means
and
the
gentleman
avails
himself
of
them
my
boy
wife
brings
the
horse
and
begad
pen
goes
in
and
wins
the
plate
that
what
i
call
a
sensible
union
a
couple
like
that
have
something
to
talk
to
each
other
about
when
they
come
together
if
you
had
cupid
himself
to
talk
to
if
blanche
and
pen
were
cupid
and
psyche
begad
they
begin
to
yawn
after
a
few
evenings
if
they
had
nothing
but
sentiment
to
speak
as
for
miss
amory
she
was
contented
enough
with
pen
as
long
as
there
was
nobody
better
and
how
many
other
young
ladies
are
like
her
and
how
many
carry
on
well
to
the
last
and
how
sentimental
firms
do
not
finish
in
bankruptcy
and
how
many
heroic
passions
dwindle
down
into
despicable
indifference
or
end
in
shameful
defeat
these
views
of
life
and
philosophy
the
major
was
constantly
according
to
his
custom
inculcating
to
pen
whose
mind
was
such
that
he
could
see
the
right
on
both
sides
of
many
questions
and
comprehending
the
sentimental
life
which
was
quite
out
of
the
reach
of
the
honest
intelligence
could
understand
the
practical
life
too
and
accommodate
himself
or
think
he
could
accommodate
himself
to
it
so
it
came
to
pass
that
during
the
spring
succeeding
his
mother
death
he
became
a
good
deal
under
the
influence
of
his
uncle
advice
and
domesticated
in
lady
clavering
house
and
in
a
measure
was
accepted
by
miss
amory
without
being
a
suitor
and
was
received
without
being
engaged
the
young
people
were
extremely
familiar
without
being
particularly
sentimental
and
met
and
parted
with
each
other
in
perfect
and
i
thought
pendennis
am
the
fellow
who
eight
years
ago
had
a
grand
passion
and
last
year
was
raging
in
a
fever
about
briseis
yes
it
was
the
same
pendennis
and
time
had
brought
to
him
as
to
the
rest
of
us
its
ordinary
consequences
consolations
developments
we
alter
very
little
when
we
talk
of
this
man
or
that
woman
being
no
longer
the
same
person
whom
we
remember
in
youth
and
remark
of
course
to
deplore
changes
in
our
friends
we
do
perhaps
calculate
that
circumstance
only
brings
out
the
latent
defect
or
quality
and
does
not
create
it
the
selfish
languor
and
indifference
of
possession
is
the
consequence
of
the
selfish
ardour
of
yesterday
pursuit
the
scorn
and
weariness
which
cries
vanitas
vanitatum
is
but
the
lassitude
of
the
sick
appetite
palled
with
pleasure
the
insolence
of
the
successful
parvenu
is
only
the
necessary
continuance
of
the
career
of
the
needy
struggler
our
mental
changes
are
like
our
grey
hairs
or
our
wrinkles
but
the
fulfilment
of
the
plan
of
mortal
growth
and
decay
that
which
is
now
was
glossy
black
once
that
which
is
sluggish
obesity
was
boisterous
rosy
health
a
few
years
back
that
calm
weariness
benevolent

and
disappointed
was

fierce
and
violent
but
a
few
years
since
and

only
settled
into
submissive
repose

and

can
bear
his

generously

there
is
a

under

on

nobody

hopeless
to
a

out
at

the

about

the

lxi

our
begum
was
at
first
so
much
enraged
at
this
last
instance
of
her
husband
duplicity
and
folly
that
she
refused
to
give
sir
francis
clavering
any
aid
in
order
to
meet
his
debts
of
honour
and
declared
that
she
would
separate
from
him
and
leave
him
to
the
consequences
of
his
incorrigible
weakness
and
waste
after
that
fatal
day
transactions
at
the
derby
the
unlucky
gambler
was
in
such
a
condition
of
mind
that
he
was
disposed
to
avoid
everybody
alike
his
with
whom
he
had
made
the
debts
which
he
trembled
lest
he
should
not
have
the
means
of
paying
and
his
wife
his
banker
on
whom
he
reasonably
doubted
whether
he
should
be
allowed
any
longer
to
draw
when
lady
clavering
asked
the
next
morning
whether
sir
francis
was
in
the
house
she
received
answer
that
he
had
not
returned
that
night
but
had
sent
a
messenger
to
his
valet
ordering
him
to
forward
clothes
and
letters
by
the
bearer
strong
knew
that
he
should
have
a
visit
or
a
message
from
him
in
the
course
of
that
or
the
subsequent
day
and
accordingly
got
a
note
beseeching
him
to
call
upon
his
distracted
friend
at
short
hotel
blackfriars
and
ask
for
francis
there
for
the
baronet
was
a
gentleman
of
that
peculiarity
of
mind
that
he
would
rather
tell
a
lie
than
not
and
always
began
a
contest
with
fortune
by
running
away
and
hiding
himself
the
boots
of
short
establishment
who
carried
clavering
message
to
grosvenor
place
and
brought
back
his
was
instantly
aware
who
was
the
owner
of
the
bag
and
he
imparted
his
information
to
the
footman
who
was
laying
the
who
carried
down
the
news
to
the
who
took
it
to
bonner
my
lady
housekeeper
and
confidential
maid
who
carried
it
to
my
lady
and
thus
every
single
person
in
the
grosvenor
place
establishment
knew
that
sir
francis
was
in
hiding
under
the
name
of
francis
at
an
inn
in
the
blackfriars
road
and
sir
francis
coachman
told
the
news
to
other
gentlemen
coachmen
who
carried
it
to
their
masters
and
to
the
neighbouring
tattersall
where
very
gloomy
anticipations
were
formed
that
sir
francis
clavering
was
about
to
make
a
tour
in
the
levant
in
the
course
of
that
day
the
number
of
letters
addressed
to
sir
francis
clavering
which
found
their
way
to
his
was
quite
remarkable
the
french
cook
sent
in
his
account
to
my
lady
the
tradesmen
who
supplied
her
ladyship
table
and
finer
and
gimcrack
the
mercers
and
ornamental
dealers
and
madame
crinoline
the
eminent
milliner
also
forwarded
their
little
bills
to
her
ladyship
in
company
with
miss
amory
private
and
by
no
means
inconsiderable
account
at
each
establishment
in
the
afternoon
of
the
day
after
the
derby
when
strong
after
a
colloquy
with
his
principal
at
short
hotel
whom
he
found
crying
and
drinking
curacoa
called
to
transact
business
according
to
his
custom
at
grosvenor
place
he
found
all
these
suspicious
documents
ranged
in
the
baronet
study
and
began
to
open
them
and
examine
them
with
a
rueful
countenance
bonner
my
lady
maid
and
housekeeper
came
down
upon
him
whilst
engaged
in
this
occupation
bonner
a
part
of
the
family
and
as
necessary
to
her
mistress
as
the
chevalier
was
to
sir
francis
was
of
course
on
lady
clavering
side
in
the
dispute
between
her
and
her
husband
and
as
by
duty
bound
even
more
angry
than
her
ladyship
herself
she
wo
pay
if
she
takes
my
advice
bonner
said
please
to
go
back
to
sir
francis
captain
and
he
lurking
about
in
a
low
and
do
dare
to
face
his
wife
like
a
man
and
say
that
we
wo
pay
his
debts
no
longer
we
made
a
man
of
him
we
took
him
out
of
gaol
and
other
folks
too
perhaps
we
paid
his
debts
over
and
over
again
we
set
him
up
in
parliament
and
gave
him
a
house
in
town
and
country
and
where
he
do
dare
show
his
face
the
shabby
sneak
given
him
the
horse
he
rides
and
the
dinner
he
eats
and
the
very
clothes
he
has
on
his
back
and
we
will
give
him
no
more
our
fortune
such
as
is
left
of
it
is
left
to
ourselves
and
we
wo
waste
any
more
of
it
on
this
ungrateful
man
we
give
him
enough
to
live
upon
and
leave
him
that
what
we
do
and
that
what
you
may
tell
him
from
susan
susan
bonner
mistress
hearing
of
strong
arrival
sent
for
him
at
this
juncture
and
the
chevalier
went
up
to
her
ladyship
not
without
hopes
that
he
should
find
her
more
tractable
than
her
factotum
bonner
many
a
time
before
had
he
pleaded
his
client
cause
with
lady
clavering
and
caused
her
to
relent
he
tried
again
once
more
he
painted
in
dismal
colours
the
situation
in
which
he
had
found
sir
francis
and
would
not
answer
for
any
consequences
which
might
ensue
if
he
could
not
find
means
of
meeting
his
engagements
kill
hisself
laughed
bonner
kill
hisself
will
he
the
best
thing
he
could
strong
vowed
that
he
had
found
him
with
the
razors
on
the
table
but
at
this
in
her
turn
lady
clavering
laughed
bitterly
he
do
himself
no
harm
as
long
as
there
a
shilling
left
of
which
he
can
rob
a
poor
woman
his
life
quite
safe
captain
you
may
depend
upon
that
ah
it
was
a
bad
day
that
ever
i
set
eyes
on
he
worse
than
the
first
man
cried
out
my
lady
he
was
a
man
he
was
a
wild
devil
but
he
had
the
courage
of
a
man
whereas
this
fellow
what
the
use
of
my
lady
paying
his
bills
and
selling
her
diamonds
and
forgiving
him
he
be
as
bad
again
next
year
the
very
next
chance
he
has
he
be
of
her
and
robbing
of
her
and
her
money
will
go
to
keep
a
pack
of
rogues
and
swindlers
i
do
mean
you
captain
you
been
a
good
friend
to
us
enough
bating
we
wish
we
never
set
eyes
on
the
chevalier
saw
from
the
words
which
bonner
had
let
slip
regarding
the
diamonds
that
the
kind
begum
was
disposed
to
relent
once
more
at
least
and
that
there
were
hopes
still
for
his
principal
upon
my
word
he
said
with
a
real
feeling
of
sympathy
for
lady
clavering
troubles
and
admiration
for
her
untiring
and
with
a
show
of
enthusiasm
which
advanced
not
a
little
his
graceless
patron
cause
anything
you
say
against
clavering
or
bonner
here
cries
out
against
me
is
no
better
than
we
deserve
both
of
us
and
it
was
an
unlucky
day
for
you
when
you
saw
either
he
has
behaved
cruelly
to
you
and
if
you
were
not
the
most
generous
and
forgiving
woman
in
the
world
i
know
there
would
be
no
chance
for
him
but
you
ca
let
the
father
of
your
son
be
a
disgraced
man
and
send
little
frank
into
the
world
with
such
a
stain
upon
him
tie
him
down
bind
him
by
any
promises
you
like
i
vouch
for
him
that
he
will
subscribe
and
break
said
bonner
and
keep
this
time
cried
out
strong
he
must
keep
them
if
you
could
have
seen
how
he
wept
strong
he
said
to
me
not
for
myself
i
feel
now
it
for
my
boy
it
for
the
best
woman
in
england
whom
i
have
treated
basely
i
know
i
have
he
did
intend
to
bet
upon
this
race
indeed
he
did
he
was
cheated
into
it
all
the
ring
was
taken
in
he
thought
he
might
make
the
bet
quite
safely
without
the
least
risk
and
it
will
be
a
lesson
to
him
for
all
his
life
long
to
see
a
man
cry
oh
it
he
do
think
much
of
making
my
dear
missus
cry
said
bonner
poor
dear
soul
look
if
he
does
if
you
the
soul
of
a
man
clavering
strong
said
to
his
principal
when
he
recounted
this
scene
to
him
you
keep
your
promise
this
time
and
so
help
me
heaven
if
you
break
word
with
her
i
turn
against
you
and
tell
what
all
cried
francis
to
whom
his
ambassador
brought
the
news
back
at
short
hotel
where
strong
found
the
baronet
crying
and
drinking
curacoa
psha
do
you
suppose
i
am
a
fool
burst
out
strong
do
you
suppose
i
could
have
lived
so
long
in
the
world
frank
clavering
without
having
my
eyes
about
me
you
know
i
have
but
to
speak
and
you
are
a
beggar
and
i
am
not
the
only
man
who
knows
your
who
else
does
gasped
clavering
old
pendennis
does
or
i
am
very
much
mistaken
he
recognised
the
man
the
first
night
he
saw
him
when
he
came
drunk
into
your
he
knows
it
does
he
shrieked
out
clavering
damn
him
kill
you
like
to
kill
us
all
would
you
old
boy
said
strong
with
a
sneer
puffing
his
cigar
the
baronet
dashed
his
weak
hand
against
his
forehead
perhaps
the
other
had
interpreted
his
wish
rightly
oh
strong
he
cried
if
i
dared
i
put
an
end
to
myself
for
i
the
d
miserable
dog
in
all
england
it
that
that
makes
me
so
wild
and
reckless
it
that
which
makes
me
take
to
drink
and
he
drank
with
a
trembling
hand
a
bumper
of
his
fortifier
the
curacoa
and
to
live
about
with
these
thieves
i
know
they
thieves
every
one
of
d
d
thieves
and
and
how
can
i
help
it
and
i
did
know
it
you
know
and
by
gad
innocent
and
until
i
saw
the
d
d
scoundrel
first
i
knew
no
more
about
it
than
the
dead
and
i
fly
and
i
go
abroad
out
of
the
reach
of
the
confounded
hells
and
i
bury
myself
in
a
forest
by
gad
and
hang
myself
up
to
a
tree
and
oh
i
the
most
miserable
beggar
in
all
england
and
so
with
more
tears
shrieks
and
curses
the
impotent
wretch
vented
his
grief
and
deplored
his
unhappy
fate
and
in
the
midst
of
groans
and
despair
and
blasphemy
vowed
his
miserable
repentance
the
honoured
proverb
which
declares
that
to
be
an
ill
wind
which
blows
good
to
nobody
was
verified
in
the
case
of
sir
francis
clavering
and
another
of
the
occupants
of
strong
chambers
in
shepherd
inn
the
man
was
good
by
a
lucky
hap

whom
colonel
altamont
made
his
bet

of

to

transactions
paid
over

many
creditors
colonel
altamont
had
the
satisfaction
of
receiving
the
odds
of
thirty
to
one
in
fifties
which
he
had
taken
against
the
winning
horse
of
the
day
numbers
of
the
colonel

were
present
on
the
occasion
to
congratulate
him
on
his
luck

own
set
and
the
gents
who
met
in
the
private
parlour
of
the
convivial
wheeler
my
host
of
the
harlequin
head
came
to
witness
their
comrade
good
fortune
and
would
have
liked
with
a
generous
sympathy
for
success
to
share
in
it
now
was
the
time
tom
driver
had
suggested
to
the
colonel
to
have
up
the
specie
ship
that
was
sunk
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
with
the
three
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
dollars
on
board
besides
bars
and
the
tredyddlums
were
very
low
to
be
bought
for
an
old
song
never
was
such
an
opportunity
for
buying
shares
keightley
insinuated
and
jack
holt
pressed
forward
his
scheme
the
audacity
of
which
pleased
the
colonel
more
than
any
other
of
the
speculations
proposed
to
him
then
of
the
harlequin
head
boys
there
was
jack
rackstraw
who
knew
of
a
pair
of
horses
which
the
colonel
must
buy
tom
fleet
whose
satirical
paper
the
swell
wanted
but
two
hundred
pounds
of
capital
to
be
worth
a
thousand
a
year
to
any
man
with
such
a
power
and
influence
colonel
you
rogue
and
the
entree
of
the
in
london
tom
urged
whilst
little
moss
abiams
entreated
the
colonel
not
to
listen
to
these
absurd
fellows
with
their
humbugging
speculations
but
to
invest
his
money
in
some
good
bills
which
moss
could
get
for
him
and
which
would
return
him
fifty
per
cent
as
safe
as
the
bank
of
england
each
and
all
of
these
worthies
came
round
the
colonel
with
their
various
blandishments
but
he
had
courage
enough
to
resist
them
and
to
button
up
his
notes
in
the
pocket
of
his
coat
and
go
home
to
strong
and
sport
the
outer
door
of
the
chambers
honest
strong
had
given
his
good
advice
about
all
his
acquaintances
and
though
when
pressed
he
did
not
mind
frankly
taking
twenty
pounds
himself
out
of
the
colonel
winnings
strong
was
a
great
deal
too
upright
to
let
others
cheat
him
he
was
not
a
bad
fellow
when
in
good
fortune
this
altamont
he
ordered
a
smart
livery
for
grady
and
made
poor
old
costigan
shed
tears
of
quickly
dried
gratitude
by
giving
him
a
note
after
a
snug
dinner
at
the
back
kitchen
and
he
bought
a
green
shawl
for
bolton
and
a
yellow
one
for
fanny
the
most
brilliant
sacrifices
of
a
regent
street
haberdasher
window
and
a
short
time
after
this
upon
her
birthday
which
happened
in
the
month
of
june
miss
amory
received
from
a
friend
a
parcel
containing
an
enormous
brass
inlaid
in
which
there
was
a
set
of
amethysts
the
most
hideous
eyes
ever
looked
upon
a
musical
and
two
keepsakes
of
the
year
before
last
and
accompanied
with
a
couple
of
gown
pieces
of
the
most
astounding
colours
the
receipt
of
which
goods
made
the
sylphide
laugh
and
wonder
immoderately
now
it
is
a
fact
that
colonel
altamont
had
made
a
purchase
of
cigars
and
french
silks
from
some
duffers
in
fleet
street
about
this
period
and
he
was
found
by
strong
in
the
open
auction
room
in
cheapside
having
invested
some
money
in
two
desks
several
pairs
of
candlesticks
a
dinner
epergne
and
a
the
dinner
epergne
remained
at
chambers
and
figured
at
the
banquets
there
which
the
colonel
gave
pretty
freely
it
seemed
beautiful
in
his
eyes
until
jack
holt
said
it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
taken
in
a
and
jack
holt
certainly
knew
the
dinners
were
pretty
frequent
at
chambers
and
sir
francis
clavering
condescended
to
partake
of
them
constantly
his
own
house
was
shut
up
the
successor
of
mirobolant
who
had
sent
in
his
bills
so
prematurely
was
dismissed
by
the
indignant
lady
clavering
the
luxuriance
of
the
establishment
was
greatly
pruned
and
reduced
one
of
the
large
footmen
was
cashiered
upon
which
the
other
gave
warning
not
liking
to
serve
without
his
mate
or
in
a
family
where
one
footman
was
kep
general
and
severe
economical
reforms
were
practised
by
the
begum
in
her
whole
household
in
consequence
of
the
extravagance
of
which
her
graceless
husband
had
been
guilty
the
major
as
her
ladyship
friend
strong
on
the
part
of
poor
clavering
her
ladyship
lawyer
and
the
honest
begum
herself
executed
these
reforms
with
promptitude
and
severity
after
paying
the
baronet
debts
the
settlement
of
which
occasioned
considerable
public
scandal
and
caused
the
baronet
to
sink
even
lower
in
the
world
estimation
than
he
had
been
before
lady
clavering
quitted
london
for
tunbridge
wells
in
high
dudgeon
refusing
to
see
her
reprobate
husband
whom
nobody
pitied
clavering
remained
in
london
patiently
by
no
means
anxious
to
meet
his
wife
just
indignation
and
sneaked
in
and
out
of
the
house
of
commons
whence
he
and
captain
raff
and
marker
would
go
to
have
a
game
at
billiards
and
a
cigar
or
showed
in
the
sporting
or
might
be
seen
lurking
about
lincoln
inn
and
his
lawyers
where
the
principals
kept
him
for
hours
waiting
and
the
clerks
winked
at
each
other
as
he
sate
in
their
office
no
wonder
that
he
relished
the
dinners
at
inn
and
was
perfectly
resigned
there
resigned
he
was
so
happy
nowhere
else
he
was
wretched
amongst
his
equals
who
scorned
him
but
here
he
was
the
chief
guest
at
the
table
where
they
continually
addressed
him
with
yes
sir
francis
and
no
sir
francis
where
he
told
his
wretched
jokes
and
where
he
quavered
his
dreary
little
french
song
after
strong
had
sung
his
jovial
chorus
and
honest
costigan
had
piped
his
irish
ditties
such
a
jolly
menage
as
strong
with
and
the
chevalier
brew
of
punch
after
dinner
would
have
been
welcome
to
many
a
better
man
than
clavering
the
solitude
of
whose
great
house
at
home
frightened
him
where
he
was
attended
only
by
the
old
woman
who
kept
the
house
and
his
valet
who
sneered
at
him
yes
dammit
said
he
to
his
friends
in
shepherd
inn
that
fellow
of
mine
i
must
turn
him
away
only
i
owe
him
two
years
wages
curse
him
and
ca
ask
my
lady
he
brings
me
my
tea
cold
of
a
morning
with
a
dem
leaden
teaspoon
and
he
says
my
lady

all
the
plate
to
the
banker
because

ai
now
ai
it
hard
that
she
wo
trust
me
with
a
single
teaspoon
ai
it
ungentlemanlike
altamont
you
know
my
lady
of
low
birth
that
is
i
beg
your
pardon
hem
that
is
it
most
cruel
of
her
not
to
show
more
confidence
in
me
and
the
very
servants
begin
to
laugh
the
damn
scoundrels
i
break
every
bone
in
their
great
hulking
bodies
curse
i
they
do
answer
my
bell
and
and
my
man
was
at
vauxhall
last
night
with
one
of
my
and
my
velvet
waistcoat
on
i
know
it
was
mine
the
confounded
impudent
blackguard
and
he
went
on
dancing
before
my
eyes
confound
him
i
sure
he
live
to
be
hanged
he
deserves
to
be
hanged
all
those
infernal
rascals
of
he
was
very
kind
to
altamont
now
he
listened
to
the
colonel
loud
stories
when
altamont
described
how
when
he
was
working
his
way
home
once
from
new
zealand
where
he
had
been
on
a
whaling
expedition
he
and
his
comrades
had
been
obliged
to
slink
on
board
at
night
to
escape
from
their
wives
by
jove
and
how
the
poor
devils
put
out
in
their
canoes
when
they
saw
the
ship
under
sail
and
paddled
madly
after
her
how
he
had
been
lost
in
the
bush
once
for
three
months
in
new
south
wales
when
he
was
there
once
on
a
trading
speculation
how
he
had
seen
boney
at
saint
helena
and
been
presented
to
him
with
the
rest
of
the
officers
of
the
indiaman
of
which
he
was
a
mate
to
all
these
tales
and
over
his
cups
altamont
told
many
of
them
and
it
must
be
owned
lied
and
bragged
a
great
deal
sir
francis
now
listened
with
great
attention
making
a
point
of
drinking
wine
with
altamont
at
dinner
and
of
treating
him
with
every
distinction
leave
him
alone
i
know
what
he
to
altamont
said
laughing
to
strong
who
remonstrated
with
him
and
leave
me
alone
i
know
what
i
very
well
i
was

on

me

royal
master

a
difference

and
i
do

of
anybody
and
i
have
the
life
of
the

you

a
man

out
into
a
wild
laugh
at

up
and
put

the

heartless
and
unkind

premises
and
you

you

every
day
till
the
game
comes
in
besides
the
neighbours
will
ask
you
about
to
dinner
you
know
sometimes
for
you
are
a
baronet
though
you
have
outrun
the
constable
and
you
got
this
comfort
that
i
off
your
shoulders
for
a
good
bit
to
come
this
two
years
if
i
play
and
i
do
intend
to
touch
the
confounded
black
and
red
and
by
that
time
my
lady
as
you
call
her
jimmy
i
used
to
say

have
come
round
again
and
you
be
ready
for

you
know
and
come
down
handsomely
to
yours
at
this
juncture
of
their
conversation
strong
returned
nor
did
the
baronet
care
much
about
prolonging
the
talk
having
got
the
money
and
he
made
his
way
from
shepherd
inn
and
went
home
and
bullied
his
servant
in
a
manner
so
unusually
brisk
and
insolent
that
the
man
concluded
his
master
must
have
pawned
some
more
of
the
house
furniture
or
at
any
rate
have
come
into
possession
of
some
ready
money
and
yet
i
looked
over
the
house
morgan
and
i
do
thin
he
has
took
any
more
of
the
things
sir
francis
valet
said
to
major
pendennis
man
as
they
met
at
their
club
soon
after
my
lady
locked
up
all
the
bejews
afore
she
went
away
and
he
could
take
away
the
picters
and
in
a
cab
and
he
would
spout
the
fenders

not
since
the
smash
when
your
governor
and
the
lawyers
and
my
lady
and
him
had
that
tremendous
scene
he
went
down
on
his
knees
my
lady
told
bonner
as
told
me
and
swear
as
he
never
more
would
touch
a
card
or
a
dice
or
put
his
name
to
a
bit
of
paper
and
my
lady
was
to
give
him
the
notes
down
to
pay
his
liabilities
after
the
race
only
your
governor
said
which
he
wrote
it
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
passed
it
across
the
table
to
the
lawyer
and
my
lady
that
some
one
else
had
better
book
up
for
him
for

kep
some
of

a
sly
old
cove
your
the
expression
of
old
cove
thus
flippantly
applied
by
the
younger
gentleman
to
himself
and
his
master
displeased
morgan
exceedingly
on
the
first
occasion
when
lightfoot
used
the
obnoxious
expression
his
comrade
anger
was
only
indicated
by
a
silent
frown
but
on
the
second
offence
morgan
who
was
smoking
his
cigar
elegantly
and
holding
it
on
the
tip
of
his
penknife
withdrew
the
cigar
from
his
lips
and
took
his
young
friend
to
task

little
and

thing
when

clavering
and

we
are
there
i
hope

a
stoopid
place

said
morgan
i

well
in
mrs

time
we

go
down
and
the
hair
refreshed
me
after
the
london
the
railroad
will
improve
arthur
property
remarked
lightfoot
what
about
the
figure
of
it
should
you
say
sir
under
fifteen
hundred
sir
answered
morgan
at
which
the
other
who
knew
the
extent
of
poor
arthur
acres
thrust
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
but
remained
wisely
silent
is
his
man
any
good
morgan
lightfoot
resumed
pidgeon
ai
used
to
society
as
yet
but
he
young
and
has
good
talents
and
has
read
a
good
deal
and
i
dessay
he
will
do
very
well
replied
morgan
he
would
quite
do
for
this
kind
of
thing
lightfoot
for
he
ai
seen
the
world
when
the
pint
of
sherry
for
which
lightfoot
called
upon
morgan
announcement
that
he
declined
to
drink
spirits
had
been
discussed
by
the
two
gentlemen
who
held
the
wine
up
to
the
light
and
smacked
their
lips
and
winked
their
eyes
at
it
and
rallied
the
landlord
as
to
the
vintage
in
the
most
approved
manner
of
connoisseurs
morgan
ruffled
equanimity
was
quite
restored
and
he
was
prepared
to
treat
his
young
friend
with
perfect
what
think
about
miss
amory
lightfoot
tell
us
in
confidence
now
do
you
think
we
should
do
well
you
understand
if
we
make
miss
into
comprendy
vous
she
and
her
ma
always
quarrellin
said
lightfoot
bonner
is
more
than
a
match
for
the
old
lady
and
treats
sir
francis
like
that
like
this
year
spill
which
i
fling
into
the
grate
but
she
dare
say
a
word
to
miss
amory
no
more
dare
none
of
us
when
a
visitor
comes
in
she
smiles
and
languishes
you
think
that
butter
would
melt
in
her
mouth
and
the
minute
he
is
gone
very
likely
she
flares
up
like
a
little
demon
and
says
things
fit
to
send
you
wild
if
arthur
comes
it
let
sing
that
there
delightful
song
or
and
write
me
them
pooty
verses
in
this
halbum
and
very
likely
she
been
her
mother
or
sticking
pins
into
her
maid
a
minute
before
she
do
stick
pins
into
her
and
pinch
her
mary
hann
showed
me
one
of
her
arms
quite
black
and
blue
and
i
recklect
bonner
as
jealous
of
me
as
a
old
cat
boxed
her
ears
for
showing
me
and
then
you
should
see
miss
at
luncheon
when
there
nobody
but
the
family
she
makes
she
never
heats
and
my
you
should
only
jest
see
her
she
has
mary
hann
to
bring
her
up
and
creams
into
her
bedroom
and
the
cook
the
only
man
in
the
house
she
civil
to
bonner
says
how
the
second
season
in
london
soppington
was
to
propose
for
her
and
actially
came
one
day
and
sor
her
fling
a
book
into
the
fire
and
scold
her
mother
so
that
he
went
down
softly
by
the
back
door
which
he
came
in
by
and
next
thing
we
heard
of
him
was
he
was
married
to
miss
rider
oh
she
a
devil
that
little
blanche
and
that
my
candig
apinium
apinion
not
apinium
lightfoot
my
good
fellow
morgan
said
with
parental
kindness
and
then
asked
of
his
own
bosom
with
a
sigh
why
the
deuce
does
my
governor
want
master
arthur
to
marry
such
a
girl
as
this
and
the
of
the
two
gentlemen
was
broken
up
by
the
entry
of
other
gentlemen
members
of
the
club
when
fashionable
politics
cribbage
and
other
amusements
ensued
and
the
conversation
became
general
the
gentleman
club
was
held
in
the
parlour
of
the
wheel
of
fortune
in
a
snug
little
leading
out
of
one
of
the
great
streets
of
mayfair
and
frequented
by
some
of
the
most
select
gentlemen
about
town
their
masters
affairs
debts
intrigues
adventures
their
ladies
good
and
bad
qualities
and
quarrels
with
their
husbands
all
the
family
secrets
were
here
discussed
with
perfect
freedom
and
confidence
and
here
when
about
to
enter
into
a
new
situation
a
gentleman
was
enabled
to
get
every
requisite
information
regarding
the
family
of
which
he
proposed
to
become
a
member
liveries
it
may
be
imagined
were
excluded
from
this
select
precinct
and
the
powdered
heads
of
the
largest
metropolitan
footmen
might
bow
down
in
vain
entreating
admission
into
the
gentleman
club
these
outcast
giants
in
plush
took
their
beer
in
an
outer
apartment
of
the
wheel
of
fortune
and
could
no
more
get
an
entry
into
the
clubroom
than
a
pall
mall
tradesman
or
a
lincoln
inn
attorney
could
get
admission
into
bays
or
spratt
and
it
is
because
the
conversation
which
we
have
permitted
to
overhear
here
in
some
measure
explains
the
characters
and
bearings
of
our
story
that
we
have
ventured
to
introduce
the
reader
into
a
society
so
exclusive
chapter
lxii
the
way
of
the
world
a
short
time
after
the
piece
of
good
fortune
which
befell
colonel
altamont
at
epsom
that
gentleman
put
into
execution
his
projected
foreign
tour
and
the
chronicler
of
the
polite
world
who
goes
down
to
london
bridge
for
the
purpose
of
taking
leave
of
the
people
of
fashion
who
quit
this
country
announced
that
among
the
company
on
board
the
soho
to
antwerp
last
saturday
were
sir
robert
lady
and
the
misses
hodge
serjeant
kewsy
and
and
miss
kewsy
colonel
altamont
major
coddy
the
colonel
travelled
in
state
and
as
became
a
gentleman
he
appeared
in
a
rich
travelling
costume
he
drank
freely
during
the
passage
and
was
not
sick
as
some
of
the
other
passengers
were
and
he
was
attended
by
his
the
faithful
irish
legionary
who
had
been
for
some
time
in
waiting
upon
himself
and
captain
strong
in
their
chambers
of
shepherd
inn
the
chevalier
partook
of
a
copious
dinner
at
blackwall
with
his
departing
friend
the
colonel
and
one
or
two
others
who
drank
many
healths
to
altamont
at
that
liberal
gentleman
expense
strong
old
boy
the
chevalier
worthy
chum
said
if
you
want
a
little
money
now
your
time
i
your
man
you
a
good
feller
and
have
been
a
good
feller
to
me
and
a
note
more
or
less
will
make
no
odds
to
me
but
strong
said
no
he
did
want
any
money
he
was
flush
quite
flush
that
is
not
flush
enough
to
pay
you
back
your
last
loan
altamont
but
quite
able
to
carry
on
for
some
time
to
come
and
so
with
a
not
uncordial
greeting
between
them
the
two
parted
had
the
possession
of
money
really
made
altamont
more
honest
and
amiable
than
he
had
hitherto
been
or
only
caused
him
to
seem
more
amiable
in
eyes
perhaps
he
really
was
better
and
money
improved
him
perhaps
it
was
the
beauty
of
wealth
strong
saw
and
respected
but
he
argued
within
himself
this
poor
devil
this
unlucky
outcast
of
a
returned
convict
is
ten
times
as
good
a
fellow
as
my
friend
sir
francis
clavering
bart
he
has
pluck
and
honesty
in
his
way
he
will
stick
to
a
friend
and
face
an
enemy
the
other
never
had
courage
to
do
either
and
what
is
it
that
has
put
the
poor
devil
under
a
cloud
he
was
only
a
little
wild
and
signed
his
name
many
a
man
has
done
worse
and
come
to
no
wrong
and
holds
his
head
up
clavering
does
no
he
do
hold
his
head
up
he
never
did
in
his
best
and
strong
perhaps
repented
him
of
the
falsehood
which
he
had
told
to
the
colonel
that
he
was
not
in
want
of
money
but
it
was
a
falsehood
on
the
side
of
honesty
and
the
chevalier
could
not
bring
down
his
stomach
to
borrow
a
second
time
from
his
outlawed
friend
besides
he
could
get
on
clavering
had
promised
him
some
not
that
clavering
promises
were
much
to
be
believed
but
the
chevalier
was
of
a
hopeful
turn
and
trusted
in
many
chances
of
catching
his
patron
and
waylaying
some
of
those
stray
remittances
and
supplies
in
the
procuring
of
which
for
his
principal
lay
strong
chief
business
he
had
grumbled
about
altamont
companionship
in
the
shepherd
inn
chambers
but
he
found
those
lodgings
more
glum
now
without
his
partner
than
with
him
the
solitary
life
was
not
agreeable
to
his
social
soul
and
he
had
got
into
extravagant
and
luxurious
habits
too
having
a
servant
at
his
command
to
run
his
errands
to
arrange
his
toilets
and
to
cook
his
meal
it
was
rather
a
grand
and
touching
sight
now
to
see
the
portly
and
handsome
gentleman
painting
his
own
boots
and
broiling
his
own
mutton
chop
it
has
been
before
stated
that
the
chevalier
had
a
wife
a
spanish
lady
of
vittoria
who
had
gone
back
to
her
friends
after
a
few
months
union
with
the
captain
whose
head
she
broke
with
a
dish
he
began
to
think
whether
he
should
not
go
back
and
see
his
juanita
the
chevalier
was
growing
melancholy
after
the
departure
of
his
friend
the
colonel
or
to
use
his
own
picturesque
expression
was
down
on
his
these
moments
of
depression
and
intervals
of
ill
fortune
occur
constantly
in
the
lives
of
heroes
marius
at
minturme
charles
edward
in
the
highlands
napoleon
before
elba
what
great
man
has
not
been
called
upon
to
face
evil
fortune
from
clavering
no
supplies
were
to
be
had
for
some
time
the
pounds
or
the
pony
which
the
exemplary
baronet
had
received
from
altamont
had
fled
out
of
clavering
keeping
as
swiftly
as
many
previous
ponies
he
had
been
down
the
river
with
a
choice
party
of
sporting
gents
who
dodged
the
police
and
landed
in
essex
where
they
put
up
billy
bluck
to
fight
dick
the
cabman
whom
the
baronet
backed
and
who
had
it
all
his
own
way
for
thirteen
rounds
when
by
an
unlucky
blow
in
the
windpipe
billy
killed
him
it
always
my
luck
strong
sir
francis
said
the
betting
was
three
to
one
on
the
cabman
and
i
thought
myself
as
sure
of
thirty
pound
as
if
i
had
it
in
my
pocket
and
dammy
i
owe
my
man
lightfoot
fourteen
pound
now
which
he
lent
and
paid
for
me
and
he
duns
me
the
confounded
impudent
blackguard
and
i
wish
to
heaven
i
knew
any
way
of
getting
a
bill
done
or
of
screwing
a
little
out
of
my
lady
i
give
you
half
ned
upon
my
soul
and
honour
i
give
you
half
if
you
can
get
anybody
to
do
us
a
little
but
ned
said
sternly
that
he
had
given
his
word
of
honour
as
a
gentleman
that
he
would
be
no
party
to
any
future
bill
transactions
in
which
her
husband
might
engage
who
had
given
his
word
of
honour
too
and
the
chevalier
said
that
he
at
least
would
keep
his
word
and
would
black
his
own
boots
all
his
life
rather
than
break
his
promise
and
what
is
more
he
vowed
he
would
advise
lady
clavering
that
sir
francis
was
about
to
break
his
faith
towards
her
upon
the
very
first
hint
which
he
could
get
that
such
was
clavering
intention
upon
this
information
sir
francis
clavering
according
to
his
custom
cried
and
cursed
very
volubly
he
spoke
of
death
as
his
only
resource
he
besought
and
implored
his
dear
strong
his
best
friend
his
dear
old
ned
not
to
throw
him
over
and
when
he
quitted
his
dearest
ned
as
he
went
down
the
stairs
of
shepherd
inn
swore
and
blasphemed
at
ned
as
the
most
infernal
villain
and
traitor
and
blackguard
and
coward
under
the
sun
and
wished
ned
was
in
his
grave
and
in
a
worse
place
only
he
would
like
the
confounded
ruffian
to
live
until
frank
clavering
had
had
his
revenge
out
of
him
in
strong
chambers
the
baronet
met
a
gentleman
whose
visits
were
now
as
it
has
been
shown
very
frequent
in
shepherd
inn
samuel
huxter
of
clavering
that
young
fellow
who
had
poached
the
walnuts
in
clavering
park
in
his
youth
and
had
seen
the
baronet
drive
through
the
street
at
home
with
four
horses
and
prance
up
to
church
with
powdered
footmen
had
an
immense
respect
for
his
member
and
a
prodigious
delight
in
making
his
acquaintance
he
introduced
himself
with
much
blushing
and
trepidation
as
a
clavering
man
son
of
huxter
of
the
father
attended
sir
francis
keeper
coxwood
when
his
gun
burst
and
took
off
three
fingers
proud
to
make
sir
acquaintance
all
of
which
introduction
sir
francis
received
affably
and
honest
huxter
talked
about
sir
francis
to
the
chaps
at
bartholomew
and
told
fanny
in
the
lodge
that
after
all
there
was
nothing
like
a
thoroughbred
un
a
regular
good
old
english
gentleman
one
of
the
olden
time
to
which
fanny
replied
that
she
thought
sir
francis
was
an
ojous
creature
she
did
know
why
but
she
abear
him
she
was
sure
he
was
wicked
and
low
and
mean
she
knew
he
was
and
when
sam
to
this
replied
that
sir
francis
was
very
affable
and
had
borrowed
half
a
sov
of
him
quite
kindly
fanny
burst
into
a
laugh
pulled
sam
long
hair
which
was
not
yet
of
irreproachable
cleanliness
patted
his
chin
and
called
him
a
stoopid
stoopid
old
foolish
stoopid
and
said
that
sir
francis
was
always
borrering
money
of
everybody
and
that
mar
had
actially
refused
him
twice
and
had
had
to
wait
three
months
to
get
seven
shillings
which
he
had
borrowed
of
do
say
but
her
borrer
but
borrow
actially
but
actually
fanny
huxter
replied
not
to
a
fault
in
her
argument
but
to
grammatical
errors
in
her
statement
well
then
her
and
borrow
and
hactually
there
then
you
stoopid
said
the
other
and
the
scholar
made
such
a
pretty
face
that
the
grammar
master
was
quickly
appeased
and
would
have
willingly
given
her
a
hundred
more
lessons
on
the
spot
at
the
price
which
he
took
for
that
one
of
course
bolton
was
by
and
i
suppose
that
fanny
and
sam
were
on
exceedingly
familiar
and
confidential
terms
by
this
time
and
that
time
had
brought
to
the
former
certain
consolations
and
soothed
certain
regrets
which
are
deucedly
bitter
when
they
occur
but
which
are
no
more
than
or
any
other
pang
eternal
as
you
sit
surrounded
by
respect
and
affection
happy
honoured
and
flattered
in
your
old
age
your
foibles
gently
indulged
your
least
words
kindly
cherished
your
garrulous
old
stories
received
for
the
hundredth
time
with
dutiful
forbearance
and
hypocritical
smiles
the
women
of
your
house
constant
in
their
flatteries
the
young
men
hushed
and
attentive
when
you
begin
to
speak
the
servants
awestricken
the
tenants
cap
in
hand
and
ready
to
act
in
the
place
of
your
worship
horses
when
your
honour
takes
a
drive
it
has
often
struck
you
o
thoughtful
dives
that
this
respect
and
these
glories
are
for
the
main
part
transferred
with
your
fee
simple
to
your
successor
that
the
servants
will
bow
and
the
tenants
shout
for
your
son
as
for
you
that
the
butler
will
fetch
him
the
wine
improved
by
a
little
keeping
that
now
in
your
cellar
and
that
when
your
night
is
come
and
the
light
of
your
life
is
gone
down
as
sure
as
the
morning
rises
after
you
and
without
you
the
sun
of
prosperity
and
flattery
shines
on
your
heir
men
come
and
bask
in
the
halo
of
consols
and
acres
that
beams
round
about
him
the
reverence
is
transferred
with
the
estate
of
which
with
all
its
advantages
pleasures
respect
and
he
in
turn
becomes
the
how
long
do
you
wish
or
expect
that
your
people
will
regret
you
how
much
time
does
a
man
devote
to
grief
before
he
begins
to
enjoy
a
great
man
must
keep
his
heir
at
his
feast
like
a
living
memento
mori
if
he
holds
very
much
by
life
the
presence
of
the
other
must
be
a
constant
sting
and
warning
make
ready
to
go
says
the
successor
to
your
honour
i
am
waiting
and
i
could
hold
it
as
well
as
what
has
this
reference
to
the
possible
reader
to
do
with
any
of
the
characters
of
this
history
do
we
wish
to
apologise
for
pen
because
he
has
got
a
white
hat
and
because
his
mourning
for
his
mother
is
fainter
all
the
lapse
of
years
all
the
career
of
fortune
all
the
events
of
life
however
strongly
they
may
move
or
eagerly
excite
him
never
can
remove
that
sainted
image
from
his
heart
or
banish
that
blessed
love
from
its
sanctuary
if
he
yields
to
wrong
the
dear
eyes
will
look
sadly
upon
him
when
he
dares
to
meet
them
if
he
does
well
endures
pain
or
conquers
temptation
the
ever
present
love
will
greet
him
he
knows
with
approval
and
pity
if
he
falls
plead
for
him
if
he
suffers
cheer
him
be
with
him
and
accompany
him
always
until
death
is
past
and
sorrow
and
sin
are
no
more
is
this
mere
dreaming
or
on
the
part
of
an
idle
useless
moralising
may
not
the
man
of
the
world
take
his
moment
too
to
be
grave
and
thoughtful
ask
of
your
own
hearts
and
memories
brother
and
sister
if
we
do
not
live
in
the
dead
and
to
speak
reverently
prove
god
by
love
of
these
matters
pen
and
warrington
often
spoke
in
many
a
solemn
and
friendly
converse
in
after
days
and
pendennis
mother
was
worshipped
in
his
memory
and
canonised
there
as
such
a
saint
ought
to
be
lucky
he
in
life
who
knows
a
few
such
women
a
kind
provision
of
heaven
it
was
that
sent
us
such
and
gave
us
to
admire
that
touching
and
wonderful
spectacle
of
innocence
and
love
and
beauty
but
as
it
is
certain
that
if
in
the
course
of
these
sentimental
conversations
any
outer
stranger
major
pendennis
for
instance
had
walked
into
pen
chambers
arthur
and
warrington
would
have
stopped
their
talk
and
chosen
another
subject
and
discoursed
about
the
opera
or
the
last
debate
in
parliament
or
miss
jones
marriage
with
captain
smith
or
what
not
so
let
us
imagine
that
the
public
steps
in
at
this
juncture
and
stops
the
confidential
talk
between
author
and
reader
and
begs
us
to
resume
our
remarks
about
this
world
with
which
both
are
certainly
better
acquainted
than
with
that
other
one
into
which
we
have
just
been
peeping
on
coming
into
his
property
arthur
pendennis
at
first
comported
himself
with
a
modesty
and
equanimity
which
obtained
his
friend
praises
though
arthur
uncle
was
a
little
inclined
to
quarrel
with
his
nephew
meanness
of
spirit
for
not
assuming
greater
state
and
pretensions
now
that
he
had
entered
on
the
enjoyment
of
his
kingdom
he
would
have
had
arthur
installed
in
handsome
quarters
and
riding
on
showy
park
hacks
or
in
cabriolets
every
day
i
am
too
absent
arthur
said
with
a
laugh
to
drive
a
cab
in
london
the
omnibus
would
cut
me
in
two
or
i
should
send
my
horse
head
into
the
ladies
and
you
would
have
me
driven
about
by
my
servant
like
an
apothecary
uncle
no
major
pendennis
would
on
no
account
have
his
nephew
appear
like
an
apothecary
the
august
representative
of
the
house
of
pendennis
must
not
so
demean
himself
and
when
arthur
pursuing
his
banter
said
and
yet
i
dare
say
sir
my
father
was
proud
enough
when
he
first
set
up
his
gig
the
old
major
hemmed
and
ha
and
his
wrinkled
face
reddened
with
a
blush
as
he
answered
you
know
what
buonaparte
said
sir
faut
laver
son
linge
sale
en
famille
there
is
no
need
sir
for
you
to
brag
that
your
father
was
a
a
medical
man
he
came
of
a
most
ancient
but
fallen
house
and
was
obliged
to
reconstruct
the
family
fortunes
as
many
a
man
of
good
family
has
done
before
him
you
are
like
the
fellow
in
sterne
sir
the
marquis
who
came
to
demand
his
sword
again
your
father
got
back
yours
for
you
you
are
a
man
of
landed
estate
by
gad
sir
and
a
gentleman
never
forget
you
are
a
then
arthur
slily
turned
on
his
uncle
the
argument
which
he
had
heard
the
old
gentleman
often
use
regarding
himself
in
the
society
which
i
have
the
honour
of
frequenting
through
your
introduction
who
cares
to
ask
about
my
paltry
means
or
my
humble
gentility
uncle
he
asked
it
would
be
absurd
of
me
to
attempt
to
compete
with
the
great
folks
and
all
that
they
can
ask
from
us
is
that
we
should
have
a
decent
address
and
good
but
for
all
that
sir
i
should
belong
to
a
better
club
or
two
the
uncle
answered
i
should
give
an
occasional
dinner
and
select
my
society
well
and
i
should
come
out
of
that
horrible
garret
in
the
temple
and
so
arthur
compromised
by
descending
to
the
second
floor
in
lamb
court
warrington
still
occupying
his
old
quarters
and
the
two
friends
being
determined
not
to
part
one
from
the
other
cultivate
kindly
reader
those
friendships
of
your
youth
it
is
only
in
that
generous
time
that
they
are
formed
how
different
the
intimacies
of
after
days
are
and
how
much
weaker
the
grasp
of
your
own
hand
after
it
has
been
shaken
about
in
twenty
years
commerce
with
the
world
and
has
squeezed
and
dropped
a
thousand
equally
careless
palms
as
you
can
seldom
fashion
your
tongue
to
speak
a
new
language
after
twenty
the
heart
refuses
to
receive
friendship
pretty
soon
it
gets
too
hard
to
yield
to
the
impression
so
pen
had
many
acquaintances
and
being
of
a
jovial
and
easy
turn
got
more
daily
but
no
friend
like
warrington
and
the
two
men
continued
to
live
almost
as
much
in
common
as
the
knights
of
the
temple
riding
upon
one
horse
for
pen
was
at
warrington
service
and
having
their
chambers
and
their
servitor
in
common
warrington
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
pen
friends
of
grosvenor
place
during
their
last
unlucky
season
in
london
and
had
expressed
himself
no
better
satisfied
with
sir
francis
and
lady
clavering
and
her
ladyship
daughter
than
was
the
public
in
general
the
world
is
right
george
said
about
those
people
the
young
men
laugh
and
talk
freely
before
those
ladies
and
about
them
the
girl
sees
people
whom
she
has
no
right
to
know
and
talks
to
men
with
whom
no
girl
should
have
an
intimacy
did
you
see
those
two
reprobates
leaning
over
lady
clavering
carriage
in
the
park
the
other
day
and
leering
under
miss
blanche
bonnet
no
good
mother
would
let
her
daughter
know
those
men
or
admit
them
within
her
the
begum
is
the
most
innocent
and
soul
alive
interposed
pen
she
never
heard
any
harm
of
captain
blackball
or
read
that
trial
in
which
charley
lovelace
figures
do
you
suppose
that
honest
ladies
read
and
remember
the
chronique
scandaleuse
as
well
as
you
you
old
grumbler
would
you
like
laura
bell
to
know
those
fellows
warrington
asked
his
face
turning
rather
red
would
you
let
any
woman
you
loved
be
contaminated
by
their
company
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
poor
begum
is
ignorant
of
their
histories
it
seems
to
me
she
is
ignorant
of
a
great
number
of
better
things
it
seems
to
me
that
your
honest
begum
is
not
a
lady
pen
it
is
not
her
fault
doubtless
that
she
has
not
had
the
education
or
learned
the
refinements
of
a
she
is
as
moral
as
lady
portsea
who
has
all
the
world
at
her
balls
and
as
refined
as
bull
who
breaks
the
king
english
and
has
half
a
dozen
dukes
at
her
table
pen
answered
rather
sulkily
why
should
you
and
i
be
more
squeamish
than
the
rest
of
the
world
why
are
we
to
visit
the
sins
of
her
father
on
this
harmless
kind
creature
she
never
did
anything
but
kindness
to
you
or
any
mortal
soul
as
far
as
she
knows
she
does
her
best
she
does
not
set
up
to
be
more
than
she
is
she
gives
you
the
best
dinners
she
can
buy
and
the
best
company
she
can
get
she
pays
the
debts
of
that
scamp
of
a
husband
of
hers
she
spoils
her
boy
like
the
most
virtuous
mother
in
england
her
opinion
about
literary
matters
to
be
sure
is
not
much
and
i
daresay
she
never
read
a
line
of
wordsworth
or
heard
of
tennyson
in
her
no
more
has
flanagan
the
laundress
growled
out
pen
mentor
no
more
has
betty
the
housemaid
and
i
have
no
word
of
blame
against
them
but
a
man
does
make
friends
of
these
a
gentleman
choose
these
for
his
companions
or
bitterly
rues
it
afterwards
if
he
do
are
you
who
are
setting
up
to
be
a
man
of
the
world
and
a
philosopher
to
tell
me
that
the
aim
of
life
is
to
guttle
three
courses
and
dine
off
silver
do
you
dare
to
own
to
yourself
that
your
ambition
in
life
is
good
claret
and
that
you
dine
with
any
provided
you
get
a
stalled
ox
to
feed
on
you
call
me
a
cynic
why
what
a
monstrous
cynicism
it
is
which
you
and
the
rest
of
you
men
of
the
world
admit
i
rather
live
upon
raw
turnips
and
sleep
in
a
hollow
tree
or
turn
backwoodsman
or
savage
than
degrade
myself
to
this
civilisation
and
own
that
a
french
cook
was
the
thing
in
life
best
worth
living
because
you
like
a
raw
beefsteak
and
a
pipe
afterwards
broke
out
pen
you
give
yourself
airs
of
superiority
over
people
whose
tastes
are
more
dainty
and
are
not
ashamed
of
the
world
they
live
in
who
goes
about
professing
particular
admiration
or
esteem
or
friendship
or
gratitude
even
for
the
people
one
meets
every
day
if
asks
me
to
his
house
and
gives
me
his
best
i
take
his
good
things
for
what
they
are
worth
and
no
more
i
do
not
profess
to
pay
him
back
in
friendship
but
in
the
conventional
money
of
society
when
we
part
we
part
without
any
grief
when
we
meet
we
are
tolerably
glad
to
see
one
another
if
i
were
only
to
live
with
my
friends
your
black
muzzle
old
george
is
the
only
face
i
should
you
are
your
uncle
pupil
said
warrington
rather
sadly
and
you
speak
like
a
and
why
not
asked
pendennis
why
not
acknowledge
the
world
i
stand
upon
and
submit
to
the
conditions
of
the
society
which
we
live
in
and
live
by
i
am
older
than
you
george
in
spite
of
your
grizzled
whiskers
and
have
seen
much
more
of
the
world
than
you
have
in
your
garret
here
shut
up
with
your
books
and
your
reveries
and
your
ideas
of
i
say
i
take
the
world
as
it
is
and
being
of
it
will
not
be
ashamed
of
it
if
the
time
is
out
of
joint
have
i
any
calling
or
strength
to
set
it
right
indeed
i
do
think
you
have
much
of

interlocutor
if
i
doubt
whether
i
am
better
than
my
neighbour
arthur
continued
if
i
concede
that
i
am
no
better
i
also
doubt
whether
he
is
better
than
i
see
men
who
begin
with
ideas
of
universal
reform
and
who
before
their
beards
are
grown
propound
their
loud
plans
for
the
regeneration
of
mankind
give
up
their
schemes
after
a
few
years
of
bootless
talking
and
vainglorious
attempts
to
lead
their
fellows
and
after
they
have
found
that
men
will
no
longer
bear
them
as
indeed
they
never
were
in
the
least
worthy
to
be
heard
sink
quietly
into
the
acknowledging
their
aims
impracticable
or
thankful
that
they
were
never
put
into
practice
the
fiercest
reformers
grow
calm
and
are
faire
to
put
up
with
things
as
they
are
the
loudest
radical
orators
become
dumb
quiescent
placemen
the
most
fervent
liberals
when
out
of
power
become
humdrum
conservatives
or
downright
tyrants
or
despots
in
office
look
at
the
thiers
look
at
guizot
in
opposition
and
in
place
look
at
the
whigs
appealing
to
the
country
and
the
whigs
in
power
would
you
say
that
the
conduct
of
these
men
is
an
act
of
treason
as
the
radicals
bawl
who
would
give
way
in
their
turn
were
their
turn
ever
to
come
no
only
that
they
submit
to
circumstances
which
are
stronger
than
they
march
as
the
world
marches
towards
reform
but
at
the
world
pace
and
the
movements
of
the
vast
body
of
mankind
must
needs
be
slow
forgo
this
scheme
as
impracticable
on
account
of
opposition
that
as
immature
because
against
the
sense
of
the
majority
are
forced
to
calculate
drawbacks
and
difficulties
as
well
as
to
think
of
reforms
and
advances
and
compelled
finally
to
submit
and
to
wait
and
to
the
right
honourable
arthur
pendennis
could
not
speak
better
or
be
more
satisfied
with
himself
if
he
was
first
lord
of
the
treasury
and
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
warrington
said
why
continued
pen
it
seems
to
me
that
my
scepticism
is
more
respectful
and
more
modest
than
the
revolutionary
ardour
of
other
folks
many
a
patriot
of
eighteen
many
a
orator
would
turn
the
bishops
out
of
the
house
of
lords
and
throw
the
lords
out
after
the
bishops
and
throw
the
throne
into
the
thames
after
the
peers
and
the
bench
is
that
man
more
modest
than
i
who
takes
these
institutions
as
i
find
them
and
waits
for
time
and
truth
to
develop
or
fortify
or
if
you
like
destroy
them
a
college
tutor
or
a
nobleman
toady
who
appears
one
fine
day
as
my
right
reverend
lord
in
a
silk
apron
and
a
and
assumes
benedictory
airs
over
me
is
still
the
same
man
we
remember
at
oxbridge
when
he
was
truckling
to
the
tufts
and
bullying
the
poor
undergraduates
in
the
an
hereditary
legislator
who
passes
his
time
with
jockeys
and
and
and
who
is
called
to
rule
over
me
and
his
other
betters
because
his
grandfather
made
a
lucky
speculation
in
the
funds
or
found
a
coal
or
tin
mine
on
his
property
or
because
his
stupid
ancestor
happened
to
be
in
command
of
ten
thousand
men
as
brave
as
himself
who
overcame
twelve
thousand
frenchmen
or
fifty
thousand
indians
such
a
man
i
say
inspires
me
with
no
more
respect
than
the
bitterest
democrat
can
feel
towards
him
but
such
as
he
is
he
is
a
part
of
the
old
society
to
which
we
belong
and
i
submit
to
his
lordship
with
acquiescence
and
he
takes
his
place
above
the
best
of
us
at
all
and
there
bides
his
time
i
do
want
to
chop
his
head
off
with
a
guillotine
or
to
fling
mud
at
him
in
the
streets
when
they
call
such
a
man
a
disgrace
to
his
order
and
such
another
who
is
good
and
gentle
refined
and
generous
who
employs
his
great
means
in
promoting
every
kindness
and
charity
and
art
and
grace
of
life
in
the
kindest
and
most
gracious
manner
an
ornament
to
his
rank
the
question
as
to
the
use
and
propriety
of
the
order
is
not
in
the
least
affected
one
way
or
other
there
it
is
extant
among
us
a
part
of
our
habits
the
creed
of
many
of
us
the
growth
of
centuries
the
symbol
of
a
most
complicated
tradition
there
stand
my
lord
the
bishop
and
my
lord
the
hereditary
legislator
what
the
french
call
transactions
both
of
them
representing
in
their
present
shape
barons
and
chiefs
from
whom
their
lordships
the
hereditaries
for
the
most
part
do
descend
and
priests
professing
to
hold
an
absolute
truth
and
a
divinely
inherited
power
the
which
truth
absolute
our
ancestors
burned
at
the
stake
and
denied
there
the
which
divine
transmissible
power
still
exists
in
print
to
be
believed
or
not
pretty
much
at
choice
and
of
these
i
say
i
acquiesce
that
they
exist
and
no
more
if
you
say
that
these
schemes
devised
before
printing
was
known
or
steam
was
born
when
thought
was
an
infant
scared
and
whipped
and
truth
under
its
guardians
was
gagged
and
swathed
and
blindfolded
and
not
allowed
to
lift
its
voice
or
to
look
out
or
to
walk
under
the
sun
before
men
were
permitted
to
meet
or
to
trade
or
to
speak
with
each
other
if
any
one
says
as
some
faithful
souls
do
that
these
schemes
are
for
ever
and
having
been
changed
and
modified
constantly
are
to
be
subject
to
no
further
development
or
decay
i
laugh
and
let
the
man
speak
but
i
would
have
toleration
for
these
as
i
would
ask
it
for
my
own
opinions
and
if
they
are
to
die
i
would
rather
they
had
a
decent
and
natural
than
an
abrupt
and
violent
you
would
have
sacrificed
to
jove
warrington
said
had
you
lived
in
the
time
of
the
christian
perhaps
i
would
said
pen
with
some
sadness
perhaps
i
am
a
coward
perhaps
my
faith
is
unsteady
but
this
is
my
own
reserve
what
i
argue
here
is
that
i
will
not
persecute
make
a
faith
or
a
dogma
absolute
and
persecution
becomes
a
logical
consequence
and
dominic
burns
a
jew
or
calvin
an
arian
or
nero
a
christian
or
elizabeth
or
mary
a
papist
or
protestant
or
their
father
both
or
either
according
to
his
humour
and
acting
without
any
pangs
of
remorse
but
on
the
contrary
notions
of
duty
fulfilled
make
dogma
absolute
and
to
inflict
or
to
suffer
death
becomes
easy
and
necessary
and
mahomet
soldiers
shouting
paradise
and
dying
on
the
christian
spears
are
not
more
or
less
praiseworthy
than
the
same
men
slaughtering
a
townful
of
jews
or
cutting
off
the
heads
of
all
prisoners
who
would
not
acknowledge
that
there
was
but
one
prophet
of
a
little
while
since
young
one
warrington
said
who
had
been
listening
to
his
friend
confessions
neither
without
sympathy
nor
scorn
for
his
mood
led
him
to
indulge
in
both
you
asked
me
why
i
remained
out
of
the
strife
of
the
world
and
looked
on
at
the
great
labour
of
my
neighbour
without
taking
any
part
in
the
struggle
why
what
a
mere
dilettante
you
own
yourself
to
be
in
this
confession
of
general
scepticism
and
what
a
listless
spectator
yourself
you
are
years
old
and
as
blase
as
a
rake
of
sixty
you
neither
hope
much
nor
care
much
nor
believe
much
you
doubt
about
other
men
as
much
as
about
yourself
were
it
made
of
such
pococuranti
as
you
the
world
would
be
intolerable
and
i
had
rather
live
in
a
wilderness
of
monkeys
and
listen
to
their
chatter
than
in
a
company
of
men
who
denied
were
the
world
composed
of
saint
bernards
or
saint
dominies
it
would
be
equally
odious
said
pen
and
at
the
end
of
a
few
scores
of
years
would
cease
to
exist
altogether
would
you
have
every
man
with
his
head
shaved
and
every
woman
in
a
cloister
carrying
out
to
the
full
the
ascetic
principle
would
you
have
conventicle
hymns
twanging
from
every
lane
in
every
city
in
the
world
would
you
have
all
the
birds
of
the
forest
sing
one
note
and
fly
with
one
feather
you
call
me
a
sceptic
because
i
acknowledge
what
is
and
in
acknowledging
that
be
it
linnet
or
lark
or
priest
or
parson
be
it
i
mean
any
single
one
of
the
infinite
varieties
of
the
creatures
of
god
whose
very
name
i
would
be
understood
to
pronounce
with
reverence
and
never
to
approach
but
with
distant
awe
i
say
that
the
study
and
acknowledgment
of
that
variety
amongst
men
especially
increases
our
respect
and
wonder
for
the
creator
commander
and
ordainer
of
all
these
minds
so
different
and
yet
so
united
meeting
in
a
common
adoration
and
offering
up
each
according
to
his
degree
and
means
of
approaching
the
divine
centre
his
acknowledgment
of
praise
and
worship
each
singing
to
recur
to
the
bird
simile
his
natural
and
so
arthur
the
hymn
of
a
saint
or
the
ode
of
a
poet
or
the
chant
of
a
newgate
thief
are
all
pretty
much
the
same
in
your
philosophy
said
george
even
that
sneer
could
be
answered
were
it
to
the
point
pendennis
replied
but
it
is
not
and
it
could
be
replied
to
you
that
even
to
the
wretched
outcry
of
the
thief
on
the
tree
the
wisest
and
the
best
of
all
teachers
we
know
of
the
untiring
comforter
and
consoler
promised
a
pitiful
hearing
and
a
certain
hope
hymns
of
saints
odes
of
poets
who
are
we
to
measure
the
chances
and
opportunities
the
means
of
doing
or
even
judging
right
and
wrong
awarded
to
men
and
to
establish
the
rule
for
meting
out
their
punishments
and
rewards
we
are
as
insolent
and
unthinking
in
judging
of
men
morals
as
of
their
intellects
we
admire
this
man
as
being
a
great
philosopher
and
set
down
the
other
as
a
dullard
not
knowing
either
or
the
amount
of
truth
in
either
or
being
certain
of
the
truth
anywhere
we
sing
te
deum
for
this
hero
who
has
won
a
battle
and
de
profundis
for
that
other
one
who
has
broken
out
of
prison
and
has
been
caught
afterwards
by
the
policeman
our
measure
of
rewards
and
punishments
is
most
partial
and
incomplete
absurdly
inadequate
utterly
worldly
and
we
wish
to
continue
it
into
the
next
world
into
that
next
and
awful
world
we
strive
to
pursue
men
and
send
after
them
our
impotent
party
verdicts
of
condemnation
or
acquittal
we
set
up
our
paltry
little
rods
to
measure
heaven
immeasurable
as
if
in
comparison
to
that
newton
mind
or
pascal
or
shakspeare
was
any
loftier
than
mine
as
if
the
ray
which
travels
from
the
sun
would
reach
me
sooner
than
the
man
who
blacks
my
boots
measured
by
that
altitude
the
tallest
and
the
smallest
among
us
are
so
alike
diminutive
and
pitifully
base
that
i
say
we
should
take
no
count
of
the
calculation
and
it
is
a
meanness
to
reckon
the
your
figure
fails
there
arthur
said
the
other
better
pleased
if
even
by
common
arithmetic
we
can
multiply
as
we
can
reduce
almost
infinitely
the
great
reckoner
must
take
count
of
all
and
the
small
is
not
small
or
the
great
great
to
his
i
do
call
those
calculations
in
question
arthur
said
i
only
say
that
yours
are
incomplete
and
premature
false
in
consequence
and
by
every
operation
multiplying
into
wider
error
i
do
not
condemn
the
men
who
murdered
socrates
and
damned
galileo
i
say
that
they
damned
galileo
and
murdered
and
yet
but
a
moment
since
you
admitted
the
propriety
of
acquiescence
in
the
present
and
i
suppose
all
other
tyrannies
no
but
that
if
an
opponent
menaces
me
of
whom
and
without
cost
of
blood
and
violence
i
can
get
rid
i
would
rather
wait
him
out
and
starve
him
out
than
fight
him
out
fabius
fought
hannibal
sceptically
who
was
his
roman
coadjutor
whom
we
read
of
in
plutarch
when
we
were
boys
who
scoffed
at
the
other
procrastination
and
doubted
his
courage
and
engaged
the
enemy
and
was
beaten
for
his
pains
in
these
speculations
and
confessions
of
arthur
the
reader
may
perhaps
see
allusions
to
questions
which
no
doubt
have
occupied
and
discomposed
himself
and
which
he
has
answered
by
very
different
solutions
to
those
come
to
by
our
friend
we
are
not
pledging
ourselves
for
the
correctness
of
his
opinions
which
readers
will
please
to
consider
are
delivered
dramatically
the
writer
being
no
more
answerable
for
them
than
for
the
sentiments
uttered
by
any
other
character
of
the
story
our
endeavour
is
merely
to
follow
out
in
its
progress
the
development
of
the
mind
of
a
worldly
and
selfish
but
not
ungenerous
or
unkind
or
man
and
it
will
be
seen
that
the
lamentable
stage
to
which
his
logic
at
present
has
brought
him
is
one
of
general
scepticism
and
sneering
acquiescence
in
the
world
as
it
is
or
if
you
like
so
to
call
it
a
belief
qualified
with
scorn
in
all
things
extant
the
tastes
and
habits
of
such
a
man
prevent
him
from
being
a
boisterous
demagogue
and
his
love
of
truth
and
dislike
of
cant
keep
him
from
advancing
crude
propositions
such
as
many
loud
reformers
are
constantly
ready
with
much
more
of
uttering
downright
falsehoods
in
arguing
questions
or
abusing
opponents
which
he
would
die
or
starve
rather
than
use
it
was
not
in
our
friend
nature
to
be
able
to
utter
certain
lies
nor
was
he
strong
enough
to
protest
against
others
except
with
a
polite
sneer
his
maxim
being
that
he
owed
obedience
to
all
acts
of
parliament
as
long
as
they
were
not
repealed
and
to
what
does
this
easy
and
sceptical
life
lead
a
man
friend
arthur
was
a
sadducee
and
the
baptist
might
be
in
the
wilderness
shouting
to
the
poor
who
were
listening
with
all
their
might
and
faith
to
the
preacher
awful
accents
and
denunciations
of
wrath
or
woe
or
salvation
and
our
friend
the
sadducee
would
turn
his
sleek
mule
with
a
shrug
and
a
smile
from
the
crowd
and
go
home
to
the
shade
of
his
terrace
and
muse
over
preacher
and
audience
and
turn
to
his
roll
of
plato
or
his
pleasant
greek
songbook
babbling
of
honey
and
hybla
and
nymphs
and
fountains
and
love
to
what
we
say
does
this
scepticism
lead
it
leads
a
man
to
a
shameful
loneliness
and
selfishness
so
to
speak
the
more
shameful
because
it
is
so
and
conscienceless
and
serene
conscience
what
is
conscience
why
accept
remorse
what
is
public
or
private
faith
mythuses
alike
enveloped
in
enormous
tradition
if
seeing
and
acknowledging
the
lies
of
the
world
arthur
as
see
them
you
can
with
only
too
fatal
a
clearness
you
submit
to
them
without
any
protest
further
than
a
laugh
if
plunged
yourself
in
easy
sensuality
you
allow
the
whole
wretched
world
to
pass
groaning
by
you
unmoved
if
the
fight
for
the
truth
is
taking
place
and
all
men
of
honour
are
on
the
ground
armed
on
the
one
side
or
the
other
and
you
alone
are
to
lie
on
your
balcony
and
smoke
your
pipe
out
of
the
noise
and
the
danger
you
had
better
have
died
or
never
have
been
at
all
than
such
a
sensual
coward
the
truth
friend
arthur
said
imperturbably
where
is
the
truth
show
it
me
that
is
the
question
between
us
i
see
it
on
both
sides
i
see
it
on
the
conservative
side
of
the
house
and
amongst
the
radicals
and
even
on
the
ministerial
benches
i
see
it
in
this
man
who
worships
by
act
of
parliament
and
is
rewarded
with
a
silk
apron
and
five
thousand
a
year
in
that
man
who
driven
fatally
by
the
remorseless
logic
of
his
creed
gives
up
everything
friends
fame
dearest
ties
closest
vanities
the
respect
of
an
army
of
churchmen
the
recognised
position
of
a
leader
and
passes
over
to
the
enemy
in
whose
ranks
he
will
serve
henceforth
as
a
nameless
private
soldier
i
see
the
truth
in
that
man
as
i
do
in
his
brother
whose
logic
drives
him
to
quite
a
different
conclusion
and
who
after
having
passed
a
life
in
vain
endeavours
to
reconcile
an
irreconcilable
book
flings
it
at
last
down
in
despair
and
declares
with
tearful
eyes
and
hands
up
to
heaven
his
revolt
and
recantation
if
the
truth
is
with
all
these
why
should
i
take
side
with
any
one
of
them
some
are
called
upon
to
preach
let
them
preach
of
these
preachers
there
are
somewhat
too
many
methinks
who
fancy
they
have
the
gift
but
we
can
not
all
be
parsons
in
church
that
is
clear
some
must
sit
silent
and
listen
or
go
to
sleep
mayhap
have
we
not
all
our
duties
the
head
blows
the
bellows
the
master
canes
the
other
boys
in
the
the
clerk
sings
out
amen
from
the
desk
and
the
beadle
with
the
staff
opens
the
door
for
his
reverence
who
rustles
in
silk
up
to
the

i
cane
the

nay

say
amen
always
or
act
as
the
church
champion

warrior
in
the
shape
of
the
beadle
with
the
staff
but
i
will
take
off
my
hat
in
the
place
and
say
my
prayers
there
too
and
shake
hands
with
the
clergyman
as
he
steps
on
the
grass
outside
do
i
know
that
his
being
there
is
a
compromise
and
that
he
stands
before
me
an
act
of
parliament
that
the
church
he
occupies
was
built
for
other
worship
that
the
methodist
chapel
is
next
door
and
that
bunyan
the
tinker
is
bawling
out
the
tidings
of
damnation
on
the
common
hard
by
yes
i
am
a
sadducee
and
i
take
things
as
i
find
them
and
the
world
and
the
acts
of
parliament
of
the
world
as
they
are
and
as
i
intend
to
take
a
wife
if
i
find
one
not
to
be
madly
in
love
and
prostrate
at
her
feet
like
a
fool
not
to
worship
her
as
an
angel
or
to
expect
to
find
her
as
such
but
to
be
to
her
and
courteous
expecting
and
pleasant
society
from
her
in
turn
and
so
george
if
ever
you
hear
of
my
marrying
depend
on
it
it
wo
be
a
romantic
attachment
on
my
side

if
you
hear
of
any
good
place

i
have
no
particular
scruples
that
i

which
would
prevent

sulky
old

i
going
down
to
to
the
country
chapter
lxiii
which
accounts
perhaps
for
chapter
lxi
the
information
regarding
the
affairs
of
the
clavering
family
which
major
pendennis
had
acquired
through
strong
and
by
his
own
personal
interference
as
the
friend
of
the
house
was
such
as
almost
made
the
old
gentleman
pause
in
any
plans
which
he
might
have
once
entertained
for
his
nephew
benefit
to
bestow
upon
arthur
a
wife
with
two
such
as
the
two
worthies
whom
the
guileless
and
unfortunate
lady
clavering
had
drawn
in
her
marriage
ventures
was
to
benefit
no
man
and
though
the
one
in
a
manner
neutralised
the
other
and
the
appearance
of
amory
or
altamont
in
public
would
be
the
signal
for
his
instantaneous
withdrawal
and
condign
punishment
for
the
fugitive
convict
had
cut
down
the
officer
in
charge
of
him
and
a
rope
would
be
inevitably
his
end
if
he
came
again
under
british
authorities
yet
no
guardian
would
like
to
secure
for
his
ward
a
wife
whose
parent
was
to
be
got
rid
of
in
such
a
way
and
the
old
gentleman
notion
always
had
been
that
altamont
with
the
gallows
before
his
eyes
would
assuredly
avoid
recognition
while
at
the
same
time
by
holding
the
threat
of
his
discovery
over
clavering
the
latter
who
would
lose
everything
by
amory
appearance
would
be
a
slave
in
the
hands
of
the
person
who
knew
so
fatal
a
secret
but
if
the
begum
paid
clavering
debts
many
times
more
her
wealth
would
be
expended
altogether
upon
this
irreclaimable
reprobate
and
her
heirs
whoever
they
might
be
would
succeed
but
to
an
emptied
treasury
and
miss
amory
instead
of
bringing
her
husband
a
good
income
and
a
seat
in
parliament
would
bring
to
that
individual
her
person
only
and
her
pedigree
with
that
lamentable
note
of
sus
per
coll
at
the
name
of
the
last
male
of
her
line
there
was
however
to
the
old
schemer
revolving
these
things
in
his
mind
another
course
yet
open
the
which
will
appear
to
the
reader
who
may
take
the
trouble
to
peruse
a
conversation
which
presently
ensued
between
major
pendennis
and
the
honourable
baronet
the
member
for
clavering
when
a
man
under
pecuniary
difficulties
disappears
from
among
his
usual
friends
and
equals
dives
out
of
sight
as
it
were
from
the
flock
of
birds
in
which
he
is
accustomed
to
sail
it
is
wonderful
at
what
strange
and
distant
nooks
he
comes
up
again
for
breath
i
have
known
a
pall
mall
lounger
and
rotten
row
buck
of
no
inconsiderable
fashion
vanish
from
amongst
his
comrades
of
the
clubs
and
the
park
and
be
discovered
very
happy
and
affable
at
an
eighteenpenny
ordinary
in
billingsgate
another
gentleman
of
great
learning
and
wit
when
outrunning
the
constable
were
i
to
say
he
was
a
literary
man
some
critics
would
vow
that
i
intended
to
insult
the
literary
profession
once
sent
me
his
address
at
a
little
called
the
fox
under
the
hill
down
a
most
darksome
and
cavernous
archway
in
the
strand
such
a
man
under
such
misfortunes
may
have
a
house
but
he
is
never
in
his
house
and
has
an
address
where
letters
may
be
left
but
only
simpletons
go
with
the
hopes
of
seeing
only
a
few
of
the
faithful
know
where
he
is
to
be
found
and
have
the
clue
to
his
so
after
the
disputes
with
his
wife
and
the
misfortunes
consequent
thereon
to
find
sir
francis
clavering
at
home
was
impossible
ever
since
i
hast
him
for
my
book
which
is
fourteen
pound
he
do
come
home
till
three
and
purtends
to
be
asleep
when
i
bring
his
water
of
a
mornin
and
dodges
hout
when
i
downstairs
lightfoot
remarked
to
his
friend
morgan
and
announced
that
he
should
go
down
to
my
lady
and
be
butler
there
and
marry
his
old
woman
in
like
manner
after
his
altercations
with
strong
the
baronet
did
not
come
near
him
and
fled
to
other
haunts
out
of
the
reach
of
the
reproaches
out
of
the
reach
of
conscience
if
possible
which
many
of
us
try
to
dodge
and
leave
behind
us
by
changes
of
scene
and
other
fugitive
stratagems
so
though
the
elder
pendennis
having
his
own
ulterior
object
was
bent
upon
seeing
pen
country
neighbour
and
representative
in
parliament
it
took
the
major
no
inconsiderable
trouble
and
time
before
he
could
get
him
into
such
a
confidential
state
and
conversation
as
were
necessary
for
the
ends
which
the
major
had
in
view
for
since
the
major
had
been
called
in
as
family
friend
and
had
cognisance
of
clavering
affairs
conjugal
and
pecuniary
the
baronet
avoided
him
as
he
always
avoided
all
his
lawyers
and
agents
when
there
was
an
account
to
be
rendered
or
an
affair
of
business
to
be
discussed
between
them
and
never
kept
any
appointment
but
when
its
object
was
the
raising
of
money
thus
previous
to
catching
this
most
shy
and
timorous
bird
the
major
made
more
than
one
futile
attempt
to
hold
him
on
one
day
it
was
a
most
invitation
to
dinner
at
greenwich
to
meet
a
few
friends
the
baronet
accepted
suspected
something
and
did
not
come
leaving
the
major
who
indeed
proposed
to
represent
in
himself
the
body
of
friends
to
eat
his
whitebait
alone
on
another
occasion
the
major
wrote
and
asked
for
ten
minutes
talk
and
the
baronet
instantly
acknowledged
the
note
and
made
the
appointment
at
four
the
next
day
at
bays
precisely
he
carefully
underlined
the
precisely
but
though
four
came
as
in
the
course
of
time
and
destiny
it
could
not
do
otherwise
no
clavering
made
his
appearance
indeed
if
he
had
borrowed
twenty
pounds
of
pendennis
he
could
not
have
been
more
timid
or
desirous
of
avoiding
the
major
and
the
latter
found
that
it
was
one
thing
to
seek
a
man
and
another
to
find
him
before
the
close
of
that
day
in
which
strong
patron
had
given
the
chevalier
the
benefit
of
so
many
blessings
before
his
face
and
curses
behind
his
back
sir
francis
clavering
who
had
pledged
his
word
and
his
oath
to
his
wife
advisers
to
draw
or
accept
no
more
bills
of
exchange
and
to
be
content
with
the
allowance
which
his
victimised
wife
still
awarded
him
had
managed
to
sign
his
respectable
name
to
a
piece
of
stamped
paper
which
the
baronet
friend
moss
abrams
had
carried
off
promising
to
have
the
bill
done
by
a
party
with
whose
intimacy
abrams
was
favoured
and
it
chanced
that
strong
heard
of
this
transaction
at
the
place
where
the
writings
had
been
drawn
in
the
namely
of
santiago
where
the
chevalier
was
constantly
in
the
habit
of
spending
an
hour
in
the
evening
he
is
at
his
old
work
again
santiago
told
his
customer
he
and
moss
abrams
were
in
my
parlour
moss
sent
out
my
boy
for
a
stamp
it
must
have
been
a
bill
for
fifty
pound
i
heard
the
baronet
tell
moss
to
date
it
two
months
back
he
will
pretend
that
it
is
an
old
bill
and
that
he
forgot
it
when
he
came
to
a
settlement
with
his
wife
the
other
day
i
dare
say
they
will
give
him
some
more
money
now
he
is
a
man
who
has
the
habit
of
putting
his
unlucky
name
to
promises
to
pay
at
six
months
has
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
too
that
his
affairs
are
known
and
canvassed
and
his
signature
handed
round
among
the
very
worst
knaves
and
rogues
of
london
santiago
shop
was
close
by
james
street
and
bury
street
where
we
have
had
the
honour
of
visiting
our
friend
major
pendennis
in
his
lodgings
the
major
was
walking
daintily
towards
his
apartment
as
strong
burning
with
wrath
and
redolent
of
havanna
strode
along
the
same
pavement
opposite
to
him
confound
these
young
men
how
they
poison
everything
with
their
smoke
thought
the
major
here
comes
a
fellow
with
mustachios
and
a
cigar
every
fellow
who
smokes
and
wears
mustachios
is
a
low
fellow
oh
mr
i
hope
you
are
well
strong
and
the
old
gentleman
making
a
dignified
bow
to
the
chevalier
was
about
to
pass
into
his
house
directing
towards
the
lock
of
the
door
with
trembling
hand
the
polished
we
have
said
that
at
the
long
and
weary
disputes
and
conferences
regarding
the
payment
of
sir
francis
clavering
last
debts
strong
and
pendennis
had
both
been
present
as
friends
and
advisers
of
the
unlucky
family
strong
stopped
and
held
out
his
hand
to
his
brother
negotiator
and
old
pendennis
put
out
towards
him
a
couple
of
ungracious
fingers
what
is
your
good
news
said
major
pendennis
patronising
the
other
still
further
and
condescending
to
address
to
him
an
observation
for
old
pendennis
had
kept
such
good
company
all
his
life
that
he
vaguely
imagined
he
honoured
common
men
by
speaking
to
them
still
in
town
strong
i
hope
i
see
you
my
news
is
bad
news
sir
strong
answered
it
concerns
our
friends
at
tunbridge
wells
and
i
should
like
to
talk
to
you
about
it
clavering
is
at
his
old
tricks
again
major
indeed
pray
do
me
the
favour
to
come
into
my
lodging
cried
the
major
with
awakened
interest
and
the
pair
entered
and
took
possession
of
his
here
seated
strong
unburthened
himself
of
his
indignation
to
the
major
and
spoke
at
large
of
clavering
recklessness
and
treachery
no
promises
will
bind
him
sir
he
said
you
remember
when
we
met
sir
with
my
lady
lawyer
how
he
would
be
satisfied
with
giving
his
honour
but
wanted
to
take
his
oath
on
his
knees
to
his
wife
and
rang
the
bell
for
a
bible
and
swore
perdition
on
his
soul
if
he
ever
would
give
another
bill
he
has
been
signing
one
this
very
day
sir
and
will
sign
as
many
more
as
you
please
for
ready
money
and
will
deceive
anybody
his
wife
or
his
child
or
his
old
friend
who
has
backed
him
a
hundred
times
why
there
a
bill
of
his
and
mine
will
be
due
next
i
thought
we
had
paid
not
that
one
strong
said
blushing
he
asked
me
not
to
mention
it
and
and
i
had
half
the
money
for
that
major
and
they
will
be
down
on
me
but
i
do
care
for
it
i
used
to
it
it
lady
clavering
that
riles
me
it
a
shame
that
that
woman
who
has
paid
him
out
of
gaol
a
score
of
times
should
be
ruined
by
his
heartlessness
a
parcel
of
boxers
any
rascals
get
his
money
and
he
scruple
to
throw
an
honest
fellow
over
would
you
believe
it
sir
he
took
money
of
altamont
you
know
whom
i
indeed
of
that
singular
man
who
i
think
came
tipsy
once
to
sir
francis
house
major
pendennis
said
with
impenetrable
countenance
who
is
altamont
strong
i
am
sure
i
do
know
if
you
do
know
the
chevalier
answered
with
a
look
of
surprise
and
suspicion
to
tell
you
frankly
said
the
major
i
have
my
suspicions
i
suppose
mind
i
only
suppose
that
in
our
friend
clavering
a
life
who
between
you
and
me
captain
strong
we
must
own
about
as
loose
a
fish
as
any
in
my
acquaintance
there
are
no
doubt
some
queer
secrets
and
stories
which
he
would
not
like
to
have
known
none
of
us
would
and
very
likely
this
fellow
who
calls
himself
altamont
knows
some
story
against
clavering
and
has
some
hold
on
him
and
gets
money
out
of
him
on
the
strength
of
his
information
i
know
some
of
the
best
men
of
the
best
families
in
england
who
are
paying
through
the
nose
in
that
way
but
their
private
affairs
are
no
business
of
mine
strong
and
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
because
i
go
and
dine
with
a
man
i
pry
into
his
secrets
or
am
answerable
for
all
his
past
life
and
so
with
our
friend
clavering
i
am
most
interested
for
his
wife
sake
and
her
daughter
who
is
a
most
charming
creature
and
when
her
ladyship
asked
me
i
looked
into
her
affairs
and
tried
to
set
them
straight
and
shall
do
so
again
you
understand
to
the
best
of
my
humble
power
and
ability
if
i
can
make
myself
useful
and
if
i
am
called
upon
you
understand
if
i
am
called
upon
and
by
the
way
this
altamont
strong
how
is
this
altamont
i
believe
you
are
acquainted
with
him
is
he
in
town
i
do
know
that
i
am
called
upon
to
know
where
he
is
major
pendennis
said
strong
rising
and
taking
up
his
hat
in
dudgeon
for
the
major
patronising
manner
and
impertinence
of
caution
offended
the
honest
gentleman
not
a
little
pendennis
manner
altered
at
once
from
a
tone
of
hauteur
to
one
of
knowing
ah
captain
strong
you
are
cautious
too
i
see
and
quite
right
my
good
sir
quite
right
we
do
know
what
ears
walls
may
have
sir
or
to
whom
we
may
be
talking
and
as
a
man
of
the
world
and
an
old
soldier
an
old
and
distinguished
soldier
i
have
been
told
captain
strong
you
know
very
well
that
there
is
no
use
in
throwing
away
your
fire
you
may
have
your
ideas
and
i
may
put
two
and
two
together
and
have
mine
but
there
are
things
which
do
concern
him
that
many
a
man
had
better
not
know
eh
captain
and
which
i
for
one
wo
know
until
i
have
reason
for
knowing
them
and
that
i
believe
is
your
maxim
too
with
regard
to
our
friend
the
baronet
i
think
with
you
it
would
be
most
advisable
that
he
should
be
checked
in
his
imprudent
courses
and
most
strongly
reprehend
any
man
departure
from
his
word
or
any
conduct
of
his
which
can
give
any
pain
to
his
family
or
cause
them
annoyance
in
any
way
that
is
my
full
and
frank
opinion
and
i
am
sure
it
is
certainly
said
strong
drily
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
delighted
that
an
old
brother
soldier
should
agree
with
me
so
fully
and
i
am
exceedingly
glad
of
the
lucky
meeting
which
has
procured
me
the
good
fortune
of
your
visit
good
evening
thank
you
morgan
show
the
door
to
captain
and
strong
preceded
by
morgan
took
his
leave
of
major
pendennis
the
chevalier
not
a
little
puzzled
at
the
old
fellow
prudence
and
the
valet
to
say
the
truth
to
the
full
as
much
perplexed
at
his
reticence
for
morgan
in
his
capacity
of
accomplished
valet
moved
here
and
there
in
a
house
as
silent
as
a
shadow
and
as
it
so
happened
during
the
latter
part
of
his
master
conversation
with
his
visitor
had
been
standing
very
close
to
the
door
and
had
overheard
not
a
little
of
the
talk
between
the
two
gentlemen
and
a
great
deal
more
than
he
could
understand
who
is
that
altamont
know
anything
about
him
and
strong
morgan
asked
of
lightfoot
on
the
next
convenient
occasion
when
they
met
at
the
club
strong
his
man
of
business
draws
the
governor
bills
and
indosses
and
does
his
odd
jobs
and
that
and
i
suppose
altamont
in
it
too
lightfoot
replied
that
you
know
always
takes
two
or
three
on
to
set
the
paper
going
altamont
put
the
pot
on
at
the
derby
and
won
a
good
bit
of
money
i
wish
the
governor
could
get
some
somewhere
and
i
could
get
my
book
paid
do
you
think
my
lady
would
pay
his
debts
again
morgan
asked
find
out
that
for
me
lightfoot
and
i
make
it
worth
your
while
my
major
pendennis
had
often
said
with
a
laugh
that
his
valet
morgan
was
a
much
richer
man
than
himself
and
indeed
by
long
course
of
careful
speculation
this
wary
and
silent
attendant
had
been
amassing
a
considerable
sum
of
money
during
the
year
which
he
had
passed
in
the
major
service
where
he
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
many
other
valets
of
distinction
from
whom
he
had
learned
the
affairs
of
their
principals
when
arthur
came
into
his
property
but
not
until
then
morgan
had
surprised
the
young
gentleman
by
saying
that
he
had
a
little
sum
of
money
some
fifty
or
a
hundred
pound
which
he
wanted
to
lay
out
to
advantage
perhaps
the
gentlemen
in
the
temple
knowing
about
affairs
and
business
and
that
could
help
a
poor
fellow
to
a
good
investment
morgan
would
be
very
much
obliged
to
arthur
most
grateful
and
obliged
indeed
if
arthur
could
tell
him
of
one
when
arthur
laughingly
replied
that
he
knew
nothing
about
money
matters
and
knew
no
earthly
way
of
helping
morgan
the
latter
with
the
utmost
simplicity
was
very
grateful
very
grateful
indeed
to
arthur
and
if
arthur
should
want
a
little
money
before
his
rents
was
paid
perhaps
he
would
kindly
remember
that
his
uncle
old
and
faithful
servant
had
some
as
he
would
like
to
put
out
and
be
most
proud
if
he
could
be
useful
anyways
to
any
of
the
family
the
prince
of
fairoaks
who
was
tolerably
prudent
and
had
no
need
of
ready
money
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
borrowing
from
his
servant
as
of
stealing
the
valet
and
was
on
the
point
of
making
some
haughty
reply
to
morgan
offer
but
was
checked
by
the
humour
of
the
transaction
morgan
a
capitalist
morgan
offering
to
lend
to
him
the
joke
was
excellent
on
the
other
hand
the
man
might
be
quite
innocent
and
the
proposal
of
money
a
simple
offer
of
so
arthur
withheld
the
sarcasm
that
was
rising
to
his
lips
and
contented
himself
by
declining
morgan
kind
proposal
he
mentioned
the
matter
to
his
uncle
however
and
congratulated
the
latter
on
having
such
a
treasure
in
his
service
it
was
then
that
the
major
said
that
he
believed
morgan
had
been
getting
devilish
rich
for
a
devilish
long
time
in
fact
he
had
bought
the
house
in
bury
street
in
which
his
master
was
a
lodger
and
had
actually
made
a
considerable
sum
of
money
from
his
acquaintance
with
the
clavering
family
and
his
knowledge
obtained
through
his
master
that
the
begum
would
pay
all
her
husband
debts
by
buying
up
as
many
of
the
acceptances
as
he
could
raise
money
to
purchase
of
these
transactions
the
major
however
knew
no
more
than
most
gentlemen
do
of
their
servants
who
live
with
us
all
our
days
and
are
strangers
to
us
so
strong
custom
is
and
so
pitiless
the
distinction
between
class
and
class
so
he
offered
to
lend
you
money
did
he
the
elder
pendennis
remarked
to
his
nephew
he
a
sly
fellow
and
a
rich
fellow
and
there
many
a
nobleman
would
like
to
have
such
a
valet
in
his
service
and
borrow
from
him
too
and
he
ai
a
bit
changed
monsieur
morgan
he
does
his
work
just
as
well
as
ever
he
always
ready
to
my
bell
steals
about
the
room
like
a
cat
he
so
attached
to
me
morgan
on
the
day
of
strong
visit
the
major
bethought
him
of
pen
story
and
that
morgan
might
help
him
and
rallied
the
valet
regarding
his
wealth
with
that
free
and
insolent
way
which
so
a
gentleman
might
be
disposed
to
adopt
towards
so
unfortunate
a
creature
i
hear
that
you
have
got
some
money
to
invest
morgan
said
the
major
it
arthur
has
been
telling
hang
him
thought
the
valet
i
glad
my
place
is
such
a
good
thank
you
sir
i
no
reason
to
complain
of
my
place
nor
of
my
master
replied
morgan
demurely
you
a
good
fellow
and
i
believe
you
are
attached
to
me
and
glad
you
get
on
well
and
i
hope
you
be
prudent
and
not
be
taking
a
or
that
kind
of
a
thought
morgan
me
in
a
the
old
fool
dammy
if
i
was
ten
years
younger
i
set
in
parlyment
before
i
died
that
i
no
thank
you
kindly
sir
i
do
think
of
the
public
line
sir
and
i
got
my
little
savings
pretty
well
put
out
you
do
a
little
in
the
discounting
way
eh
morgan
yes
sir
a
very
little
i
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
might
i
be
so
free
as
to
ask
a
question
speak
on
my
good
fellow
the
elder
said
graciously
about
sir
francis
clavering
paper
sir
do
you
think
he
any
longer
any
good
sir
will
my
lady
pay
on
any
more
sir
what
you
done
something
in
that
business
already
yes
sir
a
little
replied
morgan
dropping
down
his
eyes
and
i
do
mind
owning
sir
and
i
hope
i
may
take
the
liberty
of
saying
sir
that
a
little
more
would
make
me
very
comfortable
if
it
turned
out
as
well
as
the
why
how
much
have
you
netted
by
him
in
gad
name
asked
the
major
i
done
a
good
bit
sir
at
it
that
i
own
sir
having
some
information
and
made
acquaintance
with
the
through
your
kindness
i
put
on
the
pot
you
did
what
i
laid
my
money
on
sir
i
got
all
i
could
and
borrowed
and
bought
sir
francis
bills
many
of
had
his
name
and
the
gentleman
as
is
just
gone
out
edward
strong
esquire
sir
and
of
course
i
know
of
the
and
shindy
as
is
took
place
in
grosvenor
place
sir
and
as
i
may
as
well
make
my
money
as
another
i
be
very
much
obleeged
to
you
if
you
tell
me
whether
my
lady
will
come
down
any
although
major
pendennis
was
as
much
surprised
at
this
intelligence
regarding
his
servant
as
if
he
had
heard
that
morgan
was
a
disguised
marquis
about
to
throw
off
his
mask
and
assume
his
seat
in
the
house
of
peers
and
although
he
was
of
course
indignant
at
the
audacity
of
the
fellow
who
had
dared
to
grow
rich
under
his
nose
and
without
his
cognisance
yet
he
had
a
natural
admiration
for
every
man
who
represented
money
and
success
and
found
himself
respecting
morgan
and
being
rather
afraid
of
that
worthy
as
the
truth
began
to
dawn
upon
him
well
morgan
said
he
i
must
ask
how
rich
you
are
and
the
richer
the
better
for
your
sake
i
sure
and
if
i
could
give
you
any
information
that
could
serve
you
i
would
speedily
help
you
but
frankly
if
lady
clavering
asks
me
whether
she
shall
pay
any
more
of
sir
francis
debts
i
shall
advise
and
i
hope
she
wo
though
i
fear
she
will
and
that
is
all
i
know
and
so
you
are
aware
that
sir
francis
is
beginning
again
in
his
eh
reckless
and
imprudent
course
at
his
old
games
sir
ca
prevent
that
gentleman
he
will
do
mr
strong
was
saying
that
a
moss
abrams
was
the
holder
of
one
of
sir
francis
clavering
notes
do
you
know
anything
of
this
abrams
or
the
amount
of
the
bill
do
know
the
bill
know
abrams
quite
well
i
wish
you
would
find
out
about
it
for
me
and
i
wish
you
would
find
out
where
i
can
see
sir
francis
clavering
and
morgan
said
thank
you
sir
yes
sir
i
will
sir
and
retired
from
the
room
as
he
had
entered
it
with
his
usual
stealthy
respect
and
quiet
humility
leaving
the
major
to
muse
and
wonder
over
what
he
had
just
heard
the
next
morning
the
valet
informed
major
pendennis
that
he
had
seen
abrams
what
was
the
amount
of
the
bill
that
gentleman
was
desirous
to
negotiate
and
that
the
baronet
would
be
sure
to
be
in
the
of
the
wheel
of
fortune
tavern
that
day
at
one
to
this
appointment
sir
francis
clavering
was
punctual
and
as
at
one
he
sate
in
the
parlour
of
the
tavern
in
question
surrounded
by
spittoons
windsor
chairs
cheerful
prints
of
boxers
trotting
horses
and
pedestrians
and
the
lingering
of
last
night
tobacco
fumes
as
the
descendant
of
an
ancient
line
sate
in
this
delectable
place
accommodated
with
an
old
copy
of
bell
life
in
london
much
blotted
with
beer
the
polite
major
pendennis
walked
into
the
apartment
so
it
you
old
boy
asked
the
baronet
thinking
that
moss
abrams
had
arrived
with
the
money
how
do
you
do
sir
francis
clavering
i
wanted
to
see
you
and
followed
you
here
said
the
major
at
sight
of
whom
the
other
countenance
fell
now
that
he
had
his
opponent
before
him
the
major
was
determined
to
make
a
brisk
and
sudden
attack
upon
him
and
went
into
action
at
once
i
know
he
continued
who
is
the
exceedingly
disreputable
person
for
whom
you
took
me
clavering
and
the
errand
which
brought
you
it
ai
your
business
is
it
asked
the
baronet
with
a
sulky
and
deprecatory
look
why
are
you
following
me
about
and
taking
the
command
and
meddling
in
my
affairs
major
pendennis
i
never
done
you
any
harm
have
i
i
never
had
your
money
and
i
do
choose
to
be
dodged
about
in
this
way
and
domineered
over
i
do
choose
it
and
i
wo
have
it
if
lady
clavering
has
any
proposal
to
make
to
me
let
it
be
done
in
the
regular
way
and
through
the
lawyers
i
rather
not
have
i
am
not
come
from
lady
clavering
the
major
said
but
of
my
own
accord
to
try
and
remonstrate
with
you
clavering
and
see
if
you
can
be
kept
from
ruin
it
is
but
a
month
ago
that
you
swore
on
your
honour
and
wanted
to
get
a
bible
to
strengthen
the
oath
that
you
would
accept
no
more
bills
but
content
yourself
with
the
allowance
which
lady
clavering
gives
you
all
your
debts
were
paid
with
that
proviso
and
you
have
broken
it
this
abrams
has
a
bill
of
yours
for
sixty
it
an
old
bill
i
take
my
solemn
oath
it
an
old
bill
shrieked
out
the
baronet
you
drew
it
yesterday
and
you
dated
it
three
months
back
purposely
by
gad
clavering
you
sicken
me
with
lies
i
ca
help
telling
you
so
i
no
patience
with
you
by
gad
you
cheat
everybody
yourself
included
i
seen
a
deal
of
the
world
but
i
never
met
your
equal
at
humbugging
it
my
belief
you
had
rather
lie
than
have
you
come
here
you
old
old
beast
to
tempt
me
to
to
pitch
into
you
and
and
knock
your
old
head
off
said
the
baronet
with
a
poisonous
look
of
hatred
at
the
major
what
sir
shouted
out
the
old
major
rising
to
his
feet
and
clasping
his
cane
and
looking
so
fiercely
that
the
baronet
tone
instantly
changed
towards
him
no
no
said
clavering
piteously
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
mean
to
be
angry
or
say
anything
unkind
only
you
so
damned
harsh
to
me
major
pendennis
what
is
it
you
want
of
me
why
have
you
been
hunting
me
so
do
you
want
money
out
of
me
too
by
jove
you
know
i
not
got
a
shilling
and
so
clavering
according
to
his
custom
passed
from
a
curse
into
a
whimper
major
pendennis
saw
from
the
other
tone
that
clavering
knew
his
secret
was
in
the
major
hands
i
no
errand
from
anybody
or
no
design
upon
you
pendennis
said
but
an
endeavour
if
it
not
too
late
to
save
you
and
your
family
from
utter
ruin
through
the
infernal
recklessness
of
your
courses
i
knew
your
secret
i
did
know
it
when
i
married
her
upon
my
oath
i
did
know
it
till
the
d
d
scoundrel
came
back
and
told
me
himself
and
it
the
misery
about
that
which
makes
me
so
reckless
pendennis
indeed
it
is
the
baronet
cried
clasping
his
hands
i
knew
your
secret
from
the
very
first
day
when
i
saw
amory
come
drunk
into
your
in
grosvenor
place
i
never
forget
faces
i
remember
that
fellow
in
sydney
a
convict
and
he
remembers
me
i
know
his
trial
the
date
of
his
marriage
and
of
his
reported
death
in
the
bush
i
could
swear
to
him
and
i
know
that
you
are
no
more
married
to
lady
clavering
than
i
am
i
kept
your
secret
well
enough
for
not
told
a
single
soul
that
i
know
it
not
your
wife
not
yourself
till
poor
lady
it
would
cut
her
up
dreadfully
whimpered
sir
francis
and
it
was
my
fault
major
you
know
it
rather
than
allow
you
to
go
on
ruining
her
as
you
do
i
will
tell
her
clavering
and
tell
all
the
world
too
that
is
what
i
swear
i
will
do
unless
i
can
come
to
some
terms
with
you
and
put
some
curb
on
your
infernal
folly
by
play
debt
and
extravagance
of
all
kind
got
through
half
your
wife
fortune
and
that
of
her
legitimate
heirs
mind
her
legitimate
heirs
here
it
must
stop
you
ca
live
together
you
not
fit
to
live
in
a
great
house
like
clavering
and
before
three
years
more
were
over
would
not
leave
a
shilling
to
carry
on
settled
what
must
be
done
you
shall
have
six
hundred
a
year
you
shall
go
abroad
and
live
on
that
you
must
give
up
parliament
and
get
on
as
well
as
you
can
if
you
refuse
i
give
you
my
word
i
make
the
real
state
of
things
known
i
swear
to
amory
who
when
identified
will
go
back
to
the
country
from
whence
he
came
and
will
rid
the
widow
of
you
and
himself
together
and
so
that
boy
of
yours
loses
at
once
all
title
to
old
spell
property
and
it
goes
to
your
wife
daughter
ai
i
making
myself
pretty
clearly
understood
you
would
be
so
cruel
to
that
poor
boy
would
you
pendennis
asked
the
father
pleading
piteously
hang
it
think
about
him
he
a
nice
boy
though
he
wild
i
own
he
it
you
who
are
cruel
to
him
said
the
old
moralist
why
sir
you
ruin
him
yourself
inevitably
in
three
yes
but
perhaps
i
wo
have
such
bad
luck
you
know
the
luck
must
turn
and
i
reform
by
gad
i
reform
and
if
you
were
to
split
on
me
it
would
cut
up
my
wife
so
you
know
it
would
most
to
be
parted
from
you
said
the
old
major
with
a
sneer
you
know
she
wo
live
with
you
but
why
ca
lady
live
abroad
or
at
bath
or
at
tunbridge
or
at
the
doose
and
i
go
on
here
clavering
continued
i
like
being
here
better
than
abroad
and
i
like
being
in
parliament
it
convenient
being
in
parliament
there
very
few
seats
like
mine
left
and
if
i
gave
it
to
i
should
not
wonder
the
ministry
would
give
me
an
island
to
govern
or
some
good
thing
for
you
know
a
gentleman
of
good
family
and
have
a
handle
to
my
name
and
and
that
sort
of
thing
major
pendennis
eh
do
you
see
you
think
they
give
me
something
good
if
i
was
to
play
my
cards
well
and
then
you
know
i
save
money
and
be
kept
out
of
the
way
of
the
confounded
hells
and
rouge
et
noir
and
and
so
i
rather
not
give
up
parliament
for
at
one
instant
to
hate
and
defy
a
man
at
the
next
to
weep
before
him
and
at
the
next
to
be
perfectly
confidential
and
friendly
with
him
was
not
an
unusual
process
with
our
baronet
as
for
your
seat
in
parliament
the
major
said
with
something
of
a
blush
on
his
cheek
and
a
certain
tremor
which
the
other
did
not
see
you
must
part
with
that
sir
francis
clavering
to
to
what
are
you
going
into
the
house
major
pendennis
no
not
i
but
my
nephew
arthur
is
a
very
clever
fellow
and
would
make
a
figure
there
and
when
clavering
had
two
members
his
father
might
very
likely
have
been
one
and
and
should
like
arthur
to
be
there
the
major
said
dammy
does
he
know
it
too
cried
out
clavering
nobody
knows
anything
out
of
this
room
pendennis
answered
and
if
you
do
this
favour
for
me
i
hold
my
tongue
if
not
i
a
man
of
my
word
and
will
do
what
i
have
i
say
major
said
sir
francis
with
a
peculiarly
humble
smile
you
you
could
get
me
my
first
quarter
in
advance
could
you
like
the
best
of
fellows
you
can
do
anything
with
lady
clavering
and
upon
my
oath
i
take
up
that
bill
of
abrams
the
little
dam
scoundrel
i
know
he
do
me
in
the
business
he
always
does
and
if
you
could
do
this
for
me
we
see
and
i
think
your
best
plan
would
be
to
go
down
in
september
to
clavering
to
shoot
and
take
my
nephew
with
you
and
introduce
him
yes
that
will
be
the
best
time
and
we
will
try
and
manage
about
the
arthur
may
lend
him
that
thought
old
pendennis
confound
him
a
seat
in
parliament
is
worth
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
and
clavering
you
understand
of
course
my
nephew
knows
nothing
about
this
business
you
have
a
mind
to
retire
he
is
a
clavering
man
and
a
good
representative
for
the
borough
you
introduce
him
and
your
people
vote
for
him
you
when
can
you
get
me
the
hundred
and
fifty
major
when
shall
i
come
and
see
you
will
you
be
at
home
this
evening
or
morning
will
you
have
anything
here
they
got
some
good
bitters
in
the
bar
i
often
have
a
glass
of
bitters
it
sets
one
up
the
old
major
would
take
no
refreshment
but
rose
and
took
his
leave
of
the
baronet
who
walked
with
him
to
the
door
of
the
wheel
of
fortune
and
then
strolled
into
the
bar
where
he
took
a
glass
of
gin
and
bitters
with
the
landlady
there
and
a
gentleman
connected
with
the
ring
who
boarded
at
the
wheel
of
coming
in
he
and
sir
francis
clavering
and
the
landlord
talked
about
the
fights
and
the
news
of
the
sporting
world
in
general
and
at
length
moss
abrams
arrived
with
the
proceeds
of
the
baronet
bill
from
which
his
own
handsome
commission
was
deducted
and
out
of
the
remainder
sir
francis
stood
a
dinner
at
greenwich
to
his
distinguished
friend
and
passed
the
evening
gaily
at
vauxhall
meanwhile
major
pendennis
calling
a
cab
in
piccadilly
drove
to
lamb
court
temple
where
he
speedily
was
closeted
with
his
nephew
in
deep
conversation
after
their
talk
they
parted
on
very
good
terms
and
it
was
in
consequence
of
that
unreported
conversation
whereof
the
reader
nevertheless
can
pretty
well
guess
the
bearing
that
arthur
expressed
himself
as
we
have
heard
in
the
colloquy
with
warrington
which
is
reported
in
the
last
chapter
when
a
man
is
tempted
to
do
a
tempting
thing
he
can
find
a
hundred
ingenious
reasons
for
gratifying
his
liking
and
arthur
thought
very
much
that
he
would
like
to
be
in
parliament
and
that
he
would
like
to
distinguish
himself
there
and
that
he
need
not
care
much
what
side
he
took
as
there
was
falsehood
and
truth
on
every
side
and
on
this
and
on
other
matters
he
thought
he
would
compromise
with
his
conscience
and
that
sadduceeism
was
a
very
convenient
and
profession
of
faith
chapter
lxiv
phyllis
and
corydon
on
a
picturesque
common
in
the
neighbourhood
of
tunbridge
wells
lady
clavering
had
found
a
pretty
villa
whither
she
retired
after
her
conjugal
disputes
at
the
end
of
that
unlucky
london
season
miss
amory
of
course
accompanied
her
mother
and
master
clavering
came
home
for
the
holidays
with
whom
blanche
chief
occupation
was
to
fight
and
quarrel
but
this
was
only
a
home
pastime
and
the
young
schoolboy
was
not
fond
of
home
sports
he
found
cricket
and
horses
and
plenty
of
friends
at
tunbridge
the
begum
house
was
filled
with
a
constant
society
of
young
gentlemen
of
thirteen
who
ate
and
drank
much
too
copiously
of
tarts
and
champagne
who
rode
races
on
the
lawn
and
frightened
the
fond
mother
who
smoked
and
made
themselves
sick
and
the
unbearable
to
miss
blanche
she
did
not
like
the
society
of
young
gentlemen
of
thirteen
as
for
that
fair
young
creature
any
change
as
long
as
it
was
change
was
pleasant
to
her
and
for
a
week
or
two
she
would
have
liked
poverty
and
a
cottage
and
and
for
a
night
perhaps
a
dungeon
and
and
so
the
move
to
tunbridge
was
by
no
means
unwelcome
to
her
she
wandered
in
the
woods
and
sketched
trees
and
farmhouses
she
read
french
novels
habitually
she
drove
into
tunbridge
wells
pretty
often
and
to
any
play
or
ball
or
conjurer
or
musician
who
might
happen
to
appear
in
the
place
she
slept
a
great
deal
she
quarrelled
with
mamma
and
frank
during
the
morning
she
found
the
little
village
school
and
attended
it
and
first
fondled
the
girls
and
thwarted
the
mistress
then
scolded
the
girls
and
laughed
at
the
teacher
she
was
constant
at
church
of
course
it
was
a
pretty
little
church
of
immense
antiquity
a
little
bijou
built
the
day
before
yesterday
and
decorated
with
all
sorts
of
painted
windows
carved
saints
heads
gilt
scripture
texts
and
open
pews
blanche
began
forthwith
to
work
a
most
correct
for
the
church
she
passed
for
a
saint
with
the
clergyman
for
a
while
whom
she
quite
took
in
and
whom
she
coaxed
and
wheedled
and
fondled
so
artfully
that
poor
smirke
who
at
first
was
charmed
with
her
then
bore
with
her
then
would
hardly
speak
to
her
was
almost
mad
with
jealousy
smirke
was
the
wife
of
our
old
friend
smirke
pen
tutor
and
poor
helen
suitor
he
had
consoled
himself
for
her
refusal
with
a
young
lady
from
clapham
whom
his
mamma
provided
when
the
latter
died
our
friend
views
became
every
day
more
and
more
pronounced
he
cut
off
his
coat
collar
and
let
his
hair
grow
over
his
back
he
rigorously
gave
up
the
curl
which
he
used
to
sport
on
his
forehead
and
the
tie
of
his
neckcloth
of
which
he
was
rather
proud
he
went
without
any
tie
at
all
he
went
without
dinner
on
fridays
he
read
the
roman
hours
and
intimated
that
he
was
ready
to
receive
confessions
in
the
vestry
the
most
harmless
creature
in
the
world
he
was
denounced
as
a
black
and
most
dangerous
jesuit
and
papist
by
muffin
of
the
dissenting
chapel
and
simeon
knight
at
the
old
church
smirke
had
built
his
with
the
money
left
him
by
his
mother
at
clapham
lord
lord
what
would
she
have
said
to
hear
a
table
called
an
altar
to
see
candlesticks
on
it
to
get
letters
signed
on
the
feast
of
saint
or
the
vigil
of
saint
all
these
things
did
the
boy
of
clapham
practise
his
faithful
wife
following
him
but
when
blanche
had
a
conference
of
near
two
hours
in
the
vestry
with
smirke
belinda
paced
up
and
down
on
the
grass
where
there
were
only
two
little
as
yet
she
wished
that
she
had
a
third
there
only
only
he
would
offer
very
likely
to
that
creature
who
had
infatuated
him
in
a
fortnight
no
she
would
retire
she
would
go
into
a
convent
and
profess
and
leave
him
such
bad
thoughts
had
smirke
wife
and
his
neighbours
regarding
him
these
thinking
him
in
direct
correspondence
with
the
bishop
of
rome
that
bewailing
errors
to
her
even
more
odious
and
fatal
and
yet
our
friend
meant
no
earthly
harm
the
never
brought
him
any
letters
from
the
pope
he
thought
blanche
to
be
sure
at
first
the
most
pious
gifted
fascinating
person
he
had
ever
met
and
her
manner
of
singing
the
chants
delighted
him
but
after
a
while
he
began
to
grow
rather
tired
of
miss
amory
her
ways
and
graces
grew
stale
somehow
then
he
was
doubtful
about
miss
amory
then
she
made
a
disturbance
in
his
school
lost
her
temper
and
rapped
the
fingers
blanche
inspired
this
admiration
and
satiety
somehow
in
many
men
she
tried
to
please
them
and
flung
out
all
her
graces
at
once
came
down
to
them
with
all
her
jewels
on
all
her
smiles
and
cajoleries
and
coaxings
and
ogles
then
she
grew
tired
of
them
and
of
trying
to
please
them
and
never
having
cared
about
them
dropped
them
and
the
men
grew
tired
of
her
and
dropped
her
too
it
was
a
happy
night
for
belinda
when
blanche
went
away
and
her
husband
with
rather
a
blush
and
a
sigh
said
he
had
been
deceived
in
her
he
had
thought
her
endowed
with
many
precious
gifts
he
feared
they
were
mere
tinsel
he
thought
she
had
been
a
person
he
feared
she
had
merely
made
religion
an
amusement
she
certainly
had
quite
lost
her
temper
to
the
schoolmistress
and
beat
polly
rucker
knuckles
belinda
flew
to
his
arms
there
was
no
question
about
the
grave
or
the
veil
any
more
he
tenderly
embraced
her
on
the
forehead
there
is
none
like
thee
my
belinda
he
said
throwing
his
fine
eyes
up
to
the
ceiling
precious
among
women
as
for
blanche
from
the
instant
she
lost
sight
of
him
and
belinda
she
never
thought
or
cared
about
either
any
more
but
when
arthur
went
down
to
pass
a
few
days
at
tunbridge
wells
with
the
begum
this
stage
of
indifference
had
not
arrived
on
miss
blanche
part
or
on
that
of
the
simple
clergyman
smirke
believed
her
to
be
an
angel
and
wonder
of
a
woman
such
a
perfection
he
had
never
seen
and
sate
listening
to
her
music
in
the
summer
evenings
rapt
in
wonder
and
fascinating
as
he
had
heard
the
music
of
the
opera
to
be
he
had
never
but
once
attended
an
exhibition
of
that
nature
which
he
mentioned
with
a
blush
and
a
sigh
it
was
on
that
day
when
he
had
accompanied
helen
and
her
son
to
the
play
at
chatteris
he
could
not
conceive
anything
more
delicious
more
celestial
he
had
almost
said
than
miss
amory
music
she
was
a
most
gifted
being
she
had
a
precious
soul
she
had
the
most
remarkable
talents
to
all
outward
seeming
the
most
heavenly
disposition
etc
etc
it
was
in
this
way
that
being
then
at
the
height
of
his
own
fever
and
bewitchment
for
blanche
smirke
discoursed
to
arthur
about
her
the
meeting
between
the
two
old
acquaintances
had
been
very
cordial
arthur
loved
anybody
who
loved
his
mother
smirke
could
speak
on
that
theme
with
genuine
feeling
and
emotion
they
had
a
hundred
things
to
tell
each
other
of
what
had
occurred
in
their
lives
arthur
would
perceive
smirke
said
that
his
his
views
on
church
matters
had
developed
themselves
since
their
smirke
a
most
exemplary
person
seconded
them
with
all
her
endeavours
he
had
built
this
little
church
on
his
mother
demise
who
had
left
him
provided
with
a
sufficiency
of
worldly
means
though
in
the
cloister
himself
he
had
heard
of
arthur
reputation
he
spoke
in
the
kindest
and
most
saddened
tone
he
held
his
eyelids
down
and
bowed
his
fair
head
on
one
side
arthur
was
immensely
amused
with
him
with
his
airs
with
his
follies
and
simplicity
with
his
blank
stock
and
long
hair
with
his
real
goodness
kindness
friendliness
of
feeling
and
his
praises
of
blanche
pleased
and
surprised
our
friend
not
a
little
and
made
him
regard
her
with
eyes
of
particular
favour
the
truth
is
blanche
was
very
glad
to
see
arthur
as
one
is
glad
to
see
an
agreeable
man
in
the
country
who
brings
down
the
last
news
and
stories
from
the
great
city
who
can
talk
better
than
most
at
least
can
talk
that
darling
london
jargon
so
dear
and
indispensable
to
london
people
so
little
understood
by
persons
out
of
the
world
the
first
day
pen
came
down
he
kept
blanche
laughing
for
hours
after
dinner
she
sang
her
songs
with
redoubled
spirit
she
did
not
scold
her
mother
she
fondled
and
kissed
her
to
the
honest
surprise
when
it
came
to
be
bedtime
she
said
deja
with
the
prettiest
air
of
regret
possible
and
was
really
quite
sorry
to
go
to
bed
and
squeezed
arthur
hand
quite
fondly
he
on
his
side
gave
her
pretty
palm
a
very
cordial
pressure
our
young
gentleman
was
of
that
turn
that
eyes
very
moderately
bright
dazzled
him
she
is
very
much
improved
thought
pen
looking
out
into
the
night
very
much
i
suppose
the
begum
wo
mind
my
smoking
with
the
window
open
she
a
jolly
good
old
woman
and
blanche
is
immensely
improved
i
liked
her
manner
with
her
mother
tonight
i
liked
her
laughing
way
with
that
stupid
young
cub
of
a
boy
whom
they
ought
to
allow
to
get
tipsy
she
sang
those
little
verses
very
prettily
they
were
devilish
pretty
verses
too
though
i
say
it
who
should
say
and
he
hummed
a
tune
which
blanche
had
put
to
some
verses
of
his
own
ah
what
a
fine
night
how
jolly
a
cigar
is
at
night
how
pretty
that
little
saxon
church
looks
in
the
moonlight
i
wonder
what
old
warrington
doing
yes
she
a
dayvlish
nice
little
thing
as
my
uncle
oh
heavenly
here
broke
out
a
voice
from
a
casement
near
a
girl
voice
it
was
the
voice
of
the
author
of
larmes
pen
burst
into
a
laugh
do
tell
about
my
smoking
he
said
leaning
out
of
his
own
window
oh
go
on
i
adore
it
cried
the
lady
of
larmes
heavenly
night
heavenly
heavenly
moon
but
i
must
shut
my
window
and
not
talk
to
you
on
account
of
les
moeurs
how
droll
they
are
les
moeurs
and
pen
began
to
sing
the
goodnight
to
don
basilio
the
next
day
they
were
walking
in
the
fields
together
laughing
and
chattering
the
gayest
pair
of
friends
they
talked
about
the
days
of
their
youth
and
blanche
was
prettily
sentimental
they
talked
about
laura
dearest
laura
blanche
had
loved
her
as
a
sister
was
she
happy
with
that
odd
lady
rockminster
would
she
come
and
stay
with
them
at
tunbridge
oh
what
walks
they
would
take
together
what
songs
they
would
sing
the
old
old
songs
laura
voice
was
splendid
did
arthur
she
must
call
him
arthur
remember
the
songs
they
sang
in
the
happy
old
days
now
he
was
grown
such
a
great
man
and
had
such
a
succes
etc
etc
and
the
day
after
which
was
enlivened
with
a
happy
ramble
through
the
woods
to
penshurst
and
a
sight
of
that
pleasant
park
and
hall
came
that
conversation
with
the
curate
which
we
have
narrated
and
which
made
our
young
friend
think
more
and
more
is
she
all
this
perfection
he
asked
himself
has
she
become
serious
and
religious
does
she
tend
schools
and
visit
the
poor
is
she
kind
to
her
mother
and
brother
yes
i
am
sure
of
that
i
have
seen
and
walking
with
his
old
tutor
over
his
little
parish
and
going
to
visit
his
school
it
was
with
inexpressible
delight
that
pen
found
blanche
seated
instructing
the
children
and
fancied
to
himself
how
patient
she
must
be
how
how
ingenuous
how
really
simple
in
her
tastes
and
unspoiled
by
the
world
and
do
you
really
like
the
country
he
asked
her
as
they
walked
together
i
should
like
never
to
see
that
odious
city
again
o
arthur
that
is
well
arthur
then
one
good
thoughts
grow
up
in
these
sweet
woods
and
calm
solitudes
like
those
flowers
which
wo
bloom
in
london
you
know
the
gardener
comes
and
changes
our
balconies
once
a
week
i
do
think
i
shall
bear
to
look
london
in
the
face
again
its
odious
smoky
brazen
face
but
heigho
why
that
sigh
blanche
never
mind
yes
i
do
mind
why
tell
me
tell
me
i
wish
you
had
come
down
and
a
second
edition
of
came
out
you
do
want
me
blanche
i
do
want
you
to
go
away
i
do
think
this
house
will
be
very
happy
without
you
and
that
why
i
wish
that
you
never
had
soupirs
were
here
laid
aside
and
larmes
had
begun
ah
what
answer
is
given
to
those
in
the
eyes
of
a
young
woman
what
is
the
method
employed
for
drying
them
what
took
place
o
ringdoves
and
roses
o
dews
and
wildflowers
o
waving
greenwoods
and
balmy
airs
of
summer
here
were
two
battered
london
rakes
taking
themselves
in
for
a
moment
and
fancying
that
they
were
in
love
with
each
other
like
phillis
and
corydon
when
one
thinks
of
country
houses
and
country
walks
one
wonders
that
any
man
is
left
unmarried
chapter
lxv
temptation
easy
and
as
pendennis
commonly
was
with
warrington
how
came
it
that
arthur
did
not
inform
the
friend
and
depository
of
all
his
secrets
of
the
little
circumstances
which
had
taken
place
at
the
villa
near
tunbridge
wells
he
talked
about
the
discovery
of
his
old
tutor
smirke
freely
enough
and
of
his
wife
and
of
his
church
and
of
his
departure
from
clapha
to
rome
but
when
asked
about
blanche
his
answers
were
evasive
or
general
he
said
she
was
a
clever
little
thing
that
rightly
guided
she
make
no
such
bad
wife
after
all
but
that
he
had
for
the
moment
no
intention
of
marriage
that
his
days
of
romance
were
over
that
he
was
contented
with
his
present
lot
and
so
forth
in
the
meantime
there
came
occasionally
to
lamb
court
temple
pretty
little
satin
envelopes
superscribed
in
the
neatest
handwriting
and
sealed
with
one
of
those
admirable
ciphers
which
if
warrington
had
been
curious
enough
to
watch
his
friend
letters
or
indeed
if
the
cipher
had
been
decipherable
would
have
shown
george
that
arthur
was
in
correspondence
with
a
young
lady
whose
initials
were
b
a
to
these
pretty
little
compositions
mr
pen
replied
in
his
best
and
gallantest
manner
with
jokes
with
news
of
the
town
with
points
of
wit
nay
with
pretty
little
verses
very
likely
in
reply
to
the
versicles
of
the
muse
of
larmes
blanche
we
know
rhymes
with
branch
and
stanch
and
launch
and
no
doubt
a
gentleman
of
ingenuity
would
not
forgo
these
advantages
of
position
and
would
ring
the
pretty
little
changes
upon
these
pleasing
notes
indeed
we
believe
that
those
of
mr
pen
which
had
such
a
pleasing
success
in
the
that
charming
annual
edited
by
lady
violet
lebas
and
illustrated
by
portraits
of
the
female
nobility
by
the
famous
artist
pinkney
were
composed
at
this
period
of
our
hero
life
and
were
first
addressed
to
blanche
per
post
before
they
figured
in
print
cornets
as
it
were
to
pinkney
pictorial
garland
verses
are
all
very
well
the
elder
pendennis
said
who
found
pen
scratching
down
one
of
these
artless
effusions
at
the
club
as
he
was
waiting
for
his
dinner
and
if
mamma
allows
it
and
between
such
old
country
friends
of
course
there
may
be
a
correspondence
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
mind
pen
and
do
commit
yourself
my
boy
for
who
knows
what
the
doose
may
happen
the
best
way
is
to
make
your
letters
safe
i
never
wrote
a
letter
in
all
my
life
that
would
commit
me
and
demmy
sir
i
have
had
some
experience
of
and
the
worthy
gentleman
growing
more
garrulous
and
confidential
with
his
nephew
as
he
grew
older
told
many
affecting
instances
of
the
evil
results
consequent
upon
this
want
of
caution
to
many
persons
in
society
how
from
using
too
ardent
expressions
in
some
poetical
notes
to
the
widow
naylor
young
spoony
had
subjected
himself
to
a
visit
of
remonstrance
from
the
widow
brother
colonel
flint
and
thus
had
been
forced
into
a
marriage
with
a
woman
old
enough
to
be
his
mother
how
when
louisa
salter
had
at
length
succeeded
in
securing
young
sir
john
bird
hopwood
of
the
blues
produced
some
letters
which
miss
had
written
to
him
and
caused
a
withdrawal
on
bird
part
who
afterwards
was
united
to
miss
stickney
of
lyme
regis
etc
the
major
if
he
had
not
reading
had
plenty
of
observation
and
could
back
his
wise
saws
with
a
multitude
of
modern
instances
which
he
had
acquired
in
a
long
and
careful
perusal
of
the
great
book
of
the
world
pen
laughed
at
the
examples
and
blushing
a
little
at
his
remonstrances
said
that
he
would
bear
them
in
mind
and
be
cautious
he
blushed
perhaps
because
he
had
borne
them
in
mind
because
he
was
cautious
because
in
his
letters
to
miss
blanche
he
had
from
instinct
or
honesty
perhaps
refrained
from
any
avowals
which
might
compromise
him
do
you
remember
the
lesson
i
had
sir
in
lady
mirabel
miss
fotheringay
affair
i
am
not
to
be
caught
again
uncle
arthur
said
with
mock
frankness
and
humility
old
pendennis
congratulated
himself
and
his
nephew
heartily
on
the
latter
prudence
and
progress
and
was
pleased
at
the
position
which
arthur
was
taking
as
a
man
of
the
world
no
doubt
if
warrington
had
been
consulted
his
opinion
would
have
been
different
and
he
would
have
told
pen
that
the
boy
foolish
letters
were
better
than
the
man
adroit
compliments
and
slippery
gallantries
that
to
win
the
woman
he
loves
only
a
knave
or
a
coward
advances
under
cover
with
subterfuges
and
a
retreat
secured
behind
him
but
pen
spoke
not
on
this
matter
to
warrington
knowing
pretty
well
that
he
was
guilty
and
what
his
friend
verdict
would
be
colonel
altamont
had
not
been
for
many
weeks
absent
on
his
foreign
tour
sir
francis
clavering
having
retired
meanwhile
into
the
country
pursuant
to
his
agreement
with
major
pendennis
when
the
ills
of
fate
began
to
fall
rather
suddenly
and
heavily
upon
the
sole
remaining
partner
of
the
little
firm
of
shepherd
inn
when
strong
at
parting
with
altamont
refused
the
loan
proffered
by
the
latter
in
the
fulness
of
his
purse
and
the
generosity
of
his
heart
he
made
such
a
sacrifice
to
conscience
and
delicacy
as
caused
him
many
an
after
twinge
and
pang
and
he
felt
it
was
not
very
many
hours
in
his
life
he
had
experienced
the
feeling
that
in
this
juncture
of
his
affairs
he
had
been
too
delicate
and
too
scrupulous
why
should
a
fellow
in
want
refuse
a
kind
offer
kindly
made
why
should
a
thirsty
man
decline
a
pitcher
of
water
from
a
friendly
hand
because
it
was
a
little
soiled
strong
conscience
smote
him
for
refusing
what
the
other
had
fairly
come
by
and
generously
proffered
and
he
thought
ruefully
now
it
was
too
late
that
altamont
cash
would
have
been
as
well
in
his
pocket
as
in
that
of
the
gambling
house
proprietor
at
baden
or
ems
with
whom
his
excellency
would
infallibly
leave
his
derby
winnings
it
was
whispered
among
the
tradesmen
and
others
who
had
commercial
dealings
with
captain
strong
that
he
and
the
baronet
had
parted
company
and
that
the
captain
paper
was
henceforth
of
no
value
the
tradesmen
who
had
put
a
wonderful
confidence
in
him
hitherto
for
who
could
resist
jolly
face
and
frank
and
honest
demeanour
now
began
to
pour
in
their
bills
with
a
cowardly
mistrust
and
unanimity
the
knocks
at
the
shepherd
inn
chambers
door
were
constant
and
tailors
bootmakers
pastrycooks
who
had
furnished
dinners
in
their
own
persons
or
by
the
boys
their
representatives
held
levees
on
strong
stairs
to
these
were
added
one
or
two
persons
of
a
less
clamorous
but
far
more
sly
and
dangerous
sort
the
young
clerks
of
lawyers
namely
who
lurked
about
the
inn
or
concerted
with
campion
young
man
in
the
chambers
hard
by
having
in
their
dismal
pocketbooks
copies
of
writs
to
be
served
on
edward
strong
requiring
him
to
appear
on
an
early
day
next
term
before
our
sovereign
lady
the
queen
and
answer
to
etc
etc
from
this
invasion
of
creditors
poor
strong
who
had
not
a
guinea
in
his
pocket
had
of
course
no
refuge
but
that
of
the
castle
into
which
he
retired
shutting
the
outer
and
inner
door
upon
the
enemy
and
not
quitting
his
stronghold
until
after
nightfall
against
this
outer
barrier
the
foe
used
to
come
and
knock
and
curse
in
vain
whilst
the
chevalier
peeped
at
them
from
behind
the
little
curtain
which
he
had
put
over
the
orifice
of
his
and
had
the
dismal
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
faces
of
furious
clerk
and
fiery
dun
as
they
dashed
up
against
the
door
and
retreated
from
it
but
as
they
could
not
be
always
at
his
gate
or
sleep
on
his
staircase
the
enemies
of
the
chevalier
sometimes
left
him
free
strong
when
so
pressed
by
his
commercial
antagonists
was
not
quite
alone
in
his
defence
against
them
but
had
secured
for
himself
an
ally
or
two
his
friends
were
instructed
to
communicate
with
him
by
a
system
of
private
signals
and
they
thus
kept
the
garrison
from
starving
by
bringing
in
necessary
supplies
and
kept
up
strong
heart
and
prevented
him
from
surrendering
by
visiting
him
and
cheering
him
in
his
retreat
two
of
ned
most
faithful
allies
were
huxter
and
miss
fanny
bolton
when
hostile
visitors
were
prowling
about
the
inn
fanny
little
sisters
were
taught
a
particular
cry
or
jodel
which
they
innocently
whooped
in
the
court
when
fanny
and
huxter
came
up
to
visit
strong
they
archly
sang
this
same
note
at
his
door
when
that
barrier
was
straightway
opened
the
honest
garrison
came
out
smiling
the
provisions
and
the
pot
of
porter
were
brought
in
and
in
the
society
of
his
faithful
friends
the
beleaguered
one
passed
a
comfortable
night
there
are
some
men
who
could
not
live
under
this
excitement
but
strong
was
a
brave
man
as
we
have
said
who
had
seen
service
and
never
lost
heart
in
peril
but
besides
allies
our
general
had
secured
for
himself
under
difficulties
that
still
more
necessary
aid
a
retreat
it
has
been
mentioned
in
a
former
part
of
this
history
how
costigan
and
bows
lived
in
the
house
next
door
to
captain
strong
and
that
the
window
of
one
of
their
rooms
was
not
very
far
off
the
which
was
situated
in
the
upper
story
of
strong
chambers
a
leaden
and
gutter
served
for
the
two
and
strong
looking
out
from
his
kitchen
one
day
saw
that
he
could
spring
with
great
ease
up
to
the
sill
of
his
neighbour
window
and
clamber
up
the
pipe
which
communicated
from
one
to
the
other
he
had
laughingly
shown
this
refuge
to
his
chum
altamont
and
they
had
agreed
that
it
would
be
as
well
not
to
mention
the
circumstance
to
captain
costigan
whose
duns
were
numerous
and
who
would
be
constantly
flying
down
the
pipe
into
their
apartments
if
this
way
of
escape
were
shown
to
him
but
now
that
the
evil
days
were
come
strong
made
use
of
the
passage
and
one
afternoon
burst
in
upon
bows
and
costigan
with
his
jolly
face
and
explained
that
the
enemy
was
in
waiting
on
his
staircase
and
that
he
had
taken
this
means
of
giving
them
the
slip
so
while
were
in
waiting
in
the
passage
of
no
strong
walked
down
the
steps
of
no
dined
at
the
albion
went
to
the
play
and
returned
home
at
midnight
to
the
astonishment
of
bolton
and
fanny
who
had
not
seen
him
quit
his
chambers
and
could
not
conceive
how
he
could
have
passed
the
line
of
sentries
strong
bore
this
siege
for
some
weeks
with
admirable
spirit
and
resolution
and
as
only
such
an
old
and
brave
soldier
would
for
the
pains
and
privations
which
he
had
to
endure
were
enough
to
depress
any
man
of
ordinary
courage
and
what
vexed
and
riled
him
to
use
his
own
expression
was
the
infernal
indifference
and
cowardly
ingratitude
of
clavering
to
whom
he
wrote
letter
after
letter
which
the
baronet
never
acknowledged
by
a
single
word
or
by
the
smallest
remittance
though
a
note
as
strong
said
at
that
time
would
have
been
a
fortune
to
him
but
better
days
were
in
store
for
the
chevalier
and
in
the
midst
of
his
despondency
and
perplexities
there
came
to
him
a
most
welcome
aid
yes
if
it
had
been
for
this
good
fellow

said

a

it

the

always
risking

taking
my

quite
broken

ai
exactly
the
place
ned
said
altamont
i
came
from
said
he
and
i
had
a
deuced
lucky
month
there
well
sir
he
took
up
marks
bill
and
he
paid
the
other
fellows
that
were
upon
me
like
a
man
sir
that
he
did
said
strong
enthusiastically
and
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
stand
a
bottle
of
claret
for
this
company
and
as
many
more
as
the
company
chooses
said
altamont
with
a
blush
hallo
waiter
bring
us
a
magnum
of
the
right
sort
do
you
hear
and
we
drink
our
healths
all
round
sir
and
may
every
good
fellow
like
strong
find
another
good
fellow
to
stand
by
him
at
a
pinch
my
sentiment
pendennis
though
i
do
like
your
no
and
why
asked
arthur
strong
pressed
the
colonel
foot
under
the
table
here
and
altamont
rather
excited
filled
up
another
bumper
nodded
to
pen
drank
off
his
wine
and
said
he
was
a
gentleman
and
that
was
sufficient
and
they
were
all
the
meeting
between
these
all
gentlemen
took
place
at
richmond
whither
pendennis
had
gone
to
dinner
and
where
he
found
the
chevalier
and
his
friend
at
table
in
the
both
of
the
latter
were
exceedingly
hilarious
talkative
and
excited
by
wine
and
strong
who
was
an
admirable
told
the
story
of
his
own
siege
and
adventures
and
escapes
with
great
liveliness
and
humour
and
described
the
talk
of
the
sheriff
officers
at
his
door
the
pretty
little
signals
of
fanny
the
grotesque
exclamations
of
costigan
when
the
chevalier
burst
in
at
his
window
and
his
final
rescue
by
altamont
in
a
most
graphic
manner
and
so
as
greatly
to
interest
his
hearers
as
for
me
it
nothing
altamont
said
when
a
ship
paid
off
a
chap
spends
his
money
you
know
and
it
the
fellers
at
the
black
and
red
at
that
did
it
i
won
a
good
bit
of
money
there
and
intend
to
win
a
good
bit
more
do
i
strong
i
going
to
take
him
with
me
i
got
a
system
i
make
his
fortune
i
tell
you
i
make
your
fortune
if
you
like
dammy
everybody
fortune
but
what
i
do
and
no
mistake
boys
i
promise
you
i
put
in
for
that
little
fanny
dammy
sir
what
do
you
think
she
did
she
had
two
pound
and
i
blest
if
she
did
go
and
lend
it
to
ned
strong
did
she
ned
let
drink
her
with
all
my
heart
said
arthur
and
pledged
this
toast
with
the
greatest
cordiality
altamont
then
began
with
the
greatest
volubility
at
great
length
to
describe
his
system
he
said
that
it
was
infallible
if
played
with
coolness
that
he
had
it
from
a
chap
at
baden
who
had
lost
by
it
it
was
true
but
because
he
had
not
enough
capital
if
he
could
have
stood
one
more
turn
of
the
wheel
he
would
have
had
all
his
money
back
that
he
and
several
more
chaps
were
going
to
make
a
bank
and
try
it
and
that
he
would
put
every
shilling
he
was
worth
into
it
and
had
come
back
to
the
country
for
the
express
purpose
of
fetching
away
his
money
and
captain
strong
that
strong
should
play
for
him
that
he
could
trust
strong
and
his
temper
much
better
than
he
could
his
own
and
much
better
than
or
the
italian
that
stood
as
he
emptied
his
bottle
the
colonel
described
at
full
length
all
his
plans
and
prospects
to
pen
who
was
interested
in
listening
to
his
story
and
the
confessions
of
his
daring
and
lawless
i
met
that
queer
fellow
altamont
the
other
day
pen
said
to
his
uncle
a
day
or
two
afterwards
altamont
what
altamont
there
lord
westport
son
said
the
major
no
no
the
fellow
who
came
tipsy
into
clavering
one
day
when
we
were
there
said
the
nephew
laughing
he
said
he
did
not
like
the
name
of
pendennis
though
he
did
me
the
honour
to
think
that
i
was
a
good
i
do
know
any
man
of
the
name
of
altamont
i
give
you
my
honour
said
the
impenetrable
major
and
as
for
your
acquaintance
i
think
the
less
you
have
to
do
with
him
the
better
arthur
laughed
again
he
is
going
to
quit
the
country
and
make
his
fortune
by
a
gambling
system
he
and
my
amiable
college
acquaintance
bloundell
are
partners
and
the
colonel
takes
out
strong
with
him
as
what
is
it
that
binds
the
chevalier
and
clavering
i
wonder
i
should
think
mind
you
pen
i
should
think
but
of
course
i
have
only
the
idea
that
there
has
been
something
in
clavering
previous
life
which
gives
these
fellows
and
some
others
a
certain
power
over
him
and
if
there
should
be
no
such
a
secret
which
affair
of
ours
my
boy
dammy
i
say
it
ought
to
be
a
lesson
to
a
man
to
keep
himself
straight
in
life
and
not
to
give
any
man
a
chance
over
why
i
think
you
have
some
means
of
persuasion
over
clavering
uncle
or
why
should
he
give
me
that
seat
in
parlament
clavering
thinks
he
ai
fit
for
parliament
the
major
answered
no
more
he
is
what
to
prevent
him
from
putting
you
or
anybody
else
into
his
place
if
he
likes
do
you
think
that
government
or
the
opposition
would
make
any
bones
about
accepting
the
seat
if
he
offered
it
to
them
why
should
you
be
more
squeamish
than
the
first
men
and
the
most
honourable
men
and
men
of
the
highest
birth
and
position
in
the
country
begad
the
major
had
an
answer
of
this
kind
to
most
of
objections
and
pen
accepted
his
uncle
replies
not
so
much
because
he
believed
them
but
because
he
wished
to
believe
them
we
do
a
thing
which
of
us
has
not
not
because
everybody
does
it
but
because
we
like
it
and
our
acquiescence
alas
proves
not
that
everybody
is
right
but
that
we
and
the
rest
of
the
world
are
poor
creatures
alike
at
his
next
visit
to
tunbridge
mr
pen
did
not
forget
to
amuse
miss
blanche
with
the
history
which
he
had
learned
at
richmond
of
the
chevalier
imprisonment
and
of
altamont
gallant
rescue
and
after
he
had
told
his
tale
in
his
usual
satirical
way
he
mentioned
with
praise
and
emotion
little
fanny
generous
behaviour
to
the
chevalier
and
altamont
enthusiasm
in
her
behalf
miss
blanche
was
somewhat
jealous
and
a
good
deal
piqued
and
curious
about
fanny
among
the
many
confidential
little
communications
which
arthur
made
to
miss
amory
in
the
course
of
their
delightful
rural
drives
and
their
sweet
evening
walks
it
may
be
supposed
that
our
hero
would
not
forget
a
story
so
interesting
to
himself
and
so
likely
to
be
interesting
to
her
as
that
of
the
passion
and
cure
of
the
poor
little
ariadne
of
shepherd
inn
his
own
part
in
that
drama
he
described
to
do
him
justice
with
becoming
modesty
the
moral
which
he
wished
to
draw
from
the
tale
being
one
in
accordance
with
his
usual
satirical
mood
that
women
get
over
their
first
loves
quite
as
easily
as
men
do
for
the
fair
blanche
in
their
intimes
conversations
did
not
cease
to
twit
mr
pen
about
his
notorious
failure
in
his
own
virgin
attachment
to
the
fotheringay
and
number
one
being
withdrawn
transfer
themselves
to
number
two
without
much
difficulty
and
poor
little
fanny
was
offered
up
in
sacrifice
as
an
instance
to
prove
this
theory
what
griefs
she
had
endured
and
surmounted
what
bitter
pangs
of
hopeless
attachment
she
had
gone
through
what
time
it
had
taken
to
heal
those
wounds
of
the
tender
little
bleeding
heart
mr
pen
did
not
know
or
perhaps
did
not
choose
to
know
for
he
was
at
once
modest
and
doubtful
about
his
capabilities
as
a
conqueror
of
hearts
and
averse
to
believe
that
he
had
executed
any
dangerous
ravages
on
that
particular
one
though
his
own
instance
and
argument
told
against
himself
in
this
case
for
if
as
he
said
miss
fanny
was
by
this
time
in
love
with
her
surgical
adorer
who
had
neither
good
looks
nor
good
manners
nor
wit
nor
anything
but
ardour
and
fidelity
to
recommend
him
must
she
not
in
her
first
sickness
of
the
have
had
a
serious
attack
and
suffered
keenly
for
a
man
who
had
certainly
a
number
of
the
showy
qualities
which
huxter
wanted
you
wicked
odious
creature
miss
blanche
said
i
believe
that
you
are
enraged
with
fanny
for
being
so
impudent
as
to
forget
you
and
that
you
are
actually
jealous
of
perhaps
miss
amory
was
right
as
the
blush
which
came
in
spite
of
himself
and
tingled
upon
cheek
one
of
those
blows
with
which
a
man
vanity
is
constantly
slapping
his
face
proved
to
pen
that
he
was
angry
to
think
he
had
been
superseded
by
such
a
rival
by
such
a
fellow
as
that
without
any
conceivable
good
quality
o
pendennis
although
this
remark
does
not
apply
to
such
a
smart
fellow
as
you
if
nature
had
not
made
that
provision
for
each
sex
in
the
credulity
of
the
other
which
sees
good
qualities
where
none
exist
good
looks
in
donkeys
ears
wit
in
their
numskulls
and
music
in
their
bray
there
would
not
have
been
near
so
much
marrying
and
giving
in
marriage
as
now
obtains
and
as
is
necessary
for
the
due
propagation
and
continuance
of
the
noble
race
to
which
we
belong
jealous
or
not
pen
said
and
blanche
i
do
say
no
i
should
have
liked
fanny
to
have
come
to
a
better
end
than
that
i
do
like
histories
that
end
in
that
cynical
way
and
when
we
arrive
at
the
conclusion
of
the
story
of
a
pretty
girl
passion
to
find
such
a
figure
as
huxter
at
the
last
page
of
the
tale
is
a
life
a
compromise
my
lady
fair
and
the
end
of
the
battle
of
love
an
ignoble
surrender
is
the
search
for
the
cupid
which
my
poor
little
psyche
pursued
in
the
darkness
the
god
of
her
soul
longing
the
god
of
the
blooming
cheek
and
rainbow
pinions
to
result
in
huxter
smelling
of
tobacco
and
gallypots
i
wish
though
i
do
see
it
in
life
that
people
could
be
like
jenny
and
jessamy
or
my
lord
and
lady
clementina
in
the
and
fashionable
novels
and
at
once
under
the
ceremony
and
as
it
were
at
the
parson
benediction
become
perfectly
handsome
and
good
and
happy
ever
and
do
you
intend
to
be
good
and
happy
pray
monsieur
le
misanthrope
and
are
you
very
discontented
with
your
lot
and
will
your
marriage
be
a
compromise
asked
the
author
of
larmes
with
a
charming
moue
and
is
your
psyche
an
odious
vulgar
wretch
you
wicked
satirical
creature
i
ca
abide
you
you
take
the
hearts
of
young
things
play
with
them
and
fling
them
away
with
scorn
you
ask
for
love
and
trample
on
it
you
you
make
me
cry
that
you
do
arthur
and
and
do
and
i
wo
be
consoled
in
that
way
and
i
think
fanny
was
quite
right
in
leaving
such
a
heartless
again
i
do
say
no
said
pen
looking
very
gloomily
at
blanche
and
not
offering
by
any
means
to
repeat
the
attempt
at
consolation
which
had
elicited
that
sweet
monosyllable
do
from
the
young
lady
i
do
think
i
have
much
of
what
people
call
heart
but
i
do
profess
it
i
made
my
venture
when
i
was
eighteen
and
lighted
my
lamp
and
went
in
search
of
cupid
and
what
was
my
discovery
of
love
a
vulgar
i
failed
as
everybody
does
almost
everybody
only
it
is
luckier
to
fail
before
marriage
than
merci
du
choix
monsieur
said
the
sylphide
making
a
curtsey
look
my
little
blanche
said
pen
taking
her
hand
and
with
his
voice
of
sad
at
least
i
stoop
to
no
quite
the
contrary
said
miss
blanche
and
tell
you
no
foolish
lies
as
vulgar
men
do
why
should
you
and
i
with
our
experience
ape
romance
and
dissemble
passion
i
do
not
believe
miss
blanche
amory
to
be
peerless
among
the
beautiful
nor
the
greatest
poetess
nor
the
most
surpassing
musician
any
more
than
i
believe
you
to
be
the
tallest
woman
in
the
whole
world
like
the
giantess
whose
picture
we
saw
as
we
rode
through
the
fair
yesterday
but
if
i
do
set
you
up
as
a
heroine
neither
do
i
offer
you
your
very
humble
servant
as
a
hero
but
i
think
you
are
well
there
i
think
you
are
very
sufficiently
merci
miss
blanche
said
with
another
curtsey
i
think
you
sing
charmingly
i
sure
you
clever
i
hope
and
believe
that
you
are
and
that
you
will
be
and
so
provided
i
bring
you
a
certain
sum
of
money
and
a
seat
in
parliament
you
condescend
to
fling
to
me
your
royal
said
blanche
que
we
used
to
call
your
highness
the
prince
of
fairoaks
what
an
honour
to
think
that
i
am
to
be
elevated
to
the
throne
and
to
bring
the
seat
in
parliament
as
backsheesh
to
the
sultan
i
am
glad
i
am
clever
and
that
i
can
play
and
sing
to
your
liking
my
songs
will
amuse
my
lord
and
if
thieves
are
about
the
house
said
pen
grimly
pursuing
the
simile
forty
besetting
thieves
in
the
shape
of
lurking
cares
and
enemies
in
ambush
and
passions
in
arms
my
morgiana
will
dance
round
me
with
a
tambourine
and
kill
all
my
rogues
and
thieves
with
a
smile

she
but
pen
looked
as
if
he

not

that
she
would
ah
blanche
he
continued
after
a
pause
do
be
angry
do
be
hurt
at
my
do
you
see
that
i
always
take
you
at
your
word
you
say
you
will
be
a
slave
and
dance
i
say
dance
you

take
you
with
what
you
bring
i
say
take
you
with
what
you
bring
to
the
necessary
deceits
and
hypocrisies
of
our
life
why
add
any
that
are
useless
and
unnecessary
if
i
offer
myself
to
you
because
i
think
we
have
a
fair
chance
of
being
happy
together
and
because
by
your
help
i
may
get
for
both
of
us
a
good
place
and
a
not
undistinguished
name
why
ask
me
to
feign
raptures
and
counterfeit
romance
in
which
neither
of
us
believe
do
you
want
me
to
come
wooing
in
a
prince
prettyman
dress
from
the
masquerade
warehouse
and
to
pay
you
compliments
like
sir
charles
grandison
do
you
want
me
to
make
you
verses
as
in
the
days
when
we
were
when
we
were
children
i
will
if
you
like
and
sell
them
to
bacon
and
bungay
afterwards
shall

feed
my
pretty
princess
with
bonbons
mais

said
the
little
sylphide
with
a
queer
piteous
look
i
can
buy
a
hatful
at
fortnum
and
mason
for
a
guinea
and
it
shall
have
its
bonbons

a
bitter
smile
nay
my
dear
nay
my
dearest
little
blanche
do
cry
dry
the
pretty
eyes
i
ca
bear
that
and
he
proceeded
to
offer
that
consolation
which
the
circumstance
required
and
which
the
tears
the
genuine
tears
of
vexation
which
now
sprang
from
the
angry
eyes
of
the
author
of
larmes
demanded
the
scornful
and
sarcastic
tone
of
pendennis
quite
frightened
and
overcame
the
girl
i
i
do
want
your
consolation
i
i
never
was
so
spoken
to
before
by
any
of
my
my

out
with
much
simplicity

with
a
savage
burst
of
laughter
and

one
of
the
most
genuine
blushes
which
her
cheek
had
ever
exhibited
and
she
cried
out
o
arthur
vous
etes
un
homme
terrible
she
felt
bewildered
frightened
oppressed
the
worldly
little
flirt
who
had
been
playing
at
love
for
the
last
dozen
years
of
her
life

yet
not

said
after
a
pause
in
this
strange
why
does
sir
francis
clavering
give
up
his
seat
in
parliament
au
fait
why
does
he
give
it
to
me
asked
arthur
now
blushing
in
his
turn
you
always
mock
me
sir
she
said
if
it
is
good
to
be
in
parliament
why
does
sir
francis
go
out
my
uncle
has
talked
him
over
he
always
said
that
you
were
not
sufficiently
provided
for
in
the
the
family
disputes
when
your
mamma
paid
his
debts
so
liberally
it
was
stipulated
i
suppose
that
you
that
is
that
i
that
is
upon
my
word
i
do
know
why
he
goes
out
of
parliament
pen
said
with
rather
a
forced
laugh
you
see
blanche
that
you
and
i
are
two
good
little
children
and
that
this
marriage
has
been
arranged
for
us
by
our
mammas
and
uncles
and
that
we
must
be
obedient
like
a
good
little
boy
and
so
when
pen
went
to
london
he
sent
blanche
a
box
of
bonbons
each
of
which
was
wrapped
up
in
french
verses
of
the
most
tender
kind
and
besides
despatched
to
her
some
poems
of
his
own
manufacture
quite
as
artless
and
authentic
and
it
was
no
wonder
that
he
did
not
tell
warrington
what
his
conversations
with
miss
amory
had
been
of
so
delicate
a
sentiment
were
they
and
of
a
nature
so
necessarily
private
and
if
like
many
a
worse
and
better
man
arthur
pendennis
the
son
was
meditating
an
apostasy
and
going
to
sell
himself
to
we
all
know
whom
at
least
the
renegade
did
not
pretend
to
be
a
believer
in
the
creed
to
which
he
was
ready
to
swear
and
if
every
woman
and
man
in
this
kingdom
who
has
sold
her
or
himself
for
money
or
position
as
pendennis
was
about
to
do
would
but
purchase
a
copy
of
his
memoirs
what
tons
of
volumes
bradbury
and
evans
would
sell
chapter
lxvi
in
which
pen
begins
his
canvass
melancholy
as
the
great
house
at
clavering
park
had
been
in
the
days
before
his
marriage
when
its
bankrupt
proprietor
was
a
refugee
in
foreign
lands
it
was
not
much
more
cheerful
now
when
sir
francis
clavering
came
to
inhabit
it
the
greater
part
of
the
mansion
was
shut
up
and
the
baronet
only
occupied
a
few
of
the
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
where
his
housekeeper
and
her
assistant
from
the
waited
upon
the
luckless
gentleman
in
his
forced
retreat
and
cooked
a
part
of
the
game
which
he
spent
the
dreary
mornings
in
shooting
lightfoot
his
man
had
passed
over
to
my
lady
service
and
as
pen
was
informed
in
a
letter
from
smirke
who
performed
the
ceremony
had
executed
his
prudent
intention
of
marrying
bonner
my
woman
who
in
her
mature
years
was
stricken
with
the
charms
of
the
youth
and
endowed
him
with
her
savings
and
her
mature
person
to
be
landlord
and
landlady
of
the
clavering
arms
was
the
ambition
of
both
of
them
and
it
was
agreed
that
they
were
to
remain
in
lady
clavering
service
until
arrived
when
they
were
to
take
possession
of
their
hotel
pen
graciously
promised
that
he
would
give
his
election
dinner
there
when
the
baronet
should
vacate
his
seat
in
the
young
man
favour
and
as
it
had
been
agreed
by
his
uncle
to
whom
clavering
seemed
to
be
able
to
refuse
nothing
arthur
came
down
in
september
on
a
visit
to
clavering
park
the
owner
of
which
was
very
glad
to
have
a
companion
who
would
relieve
his
loneliness
and
perhaps
would
lend
him
a
little
ready
money
pen
furnished
his
host
with
these
desirable
supplies
a
couple
of
days
after
he
had
made
his
appearance
at
clavering
and
no
sooner
were
these
small
funds
in
sir
francis
pocket
than
the
latter
found
he
had
business
at
chatteris
and
at
the
neighbouring
of
which
shire
boasts
many
and
went
off
to
see
to
his
affairs
which
were
transacted
as
might
be
supposed
at
the
county
and
arthur
could
live
alone
well
enough
having
many
mental
resources
and
amusements
which
did
not
require
other
persons
company
he
could
walk
with
the
gamekeeper
of
a
morning
and
for
the
evenings
there
was
a
plenty
of
books
and
occupation
for
a
literary
genius
like
arthur
who
required
but
a
cigar
and
a
sheet
of
paper
or
two
to
make
the
night
pass
away
pleasantly
in
truth
in
two
or
three
days
he
had
found
the
society
of
sir
francis
clavering
perfectly
intolerable
and
it
was
with
a
mischievous
eagerness
and
satisfaction
that
he
offered
clavering
the
little
pecuniary
aid
which
the
latter
according
to
his
custom
solicited
and
supplied
him
with
the
means
of
taking
flight
from
his
own
house
besides
our
ingenious
friend
had
to
ingratiate
himself
with
the
townspeople
of
clavering
and
with
the
voters
of
the
borough
which
he
hoped
to
represent
and
he
set
himself
to
this
task
with
only
the
more
eagerness
remembering
how
unpopular
he
had
before
been
in
clavering
and
determined
to
vanquish
the
odium
which
he
had
inspired
amongst
the
simple
people
there
his
sense
of
humour
made
him
delight
in
this
task
naturally
rather
reserved
and
silent
in
public
he
became
on
a
sudden
as
frank
easy
and
jovial
as
captain
strong
he
laughed
with
everybody
who
would
exchange
a
laugh
with
him
shook
hands
right
and
left
with
what
may
be
certainly
called
a
dexterous
cordiality
made
his
appearance
at
the
and
the
farmers
ordinary
and
in
fine
acted
like
a
consummate
hypocrite
and
as
gentlemen
of
the
highest
birth
and
most
spotless
integrity
act
when
they
wish
to
make
themselves
agreeable
to
their
constituents
and
have
some
end
to
gain
of
the
how
is
it
that
we
allow
ourselves
not
to
be
deceived
but
to
be
ingratiated
so
readily
by
a
glib
tongue
a
ready
laugh
and
a
frank
manner
we
know
for
the
most
part
that
it
is
false
coin
and
we
take
it
we
know
that
it
is
flattery
which
it
costs
nothing
to
distribute
to
everybody
and
we
had
rather
have
it
than
be
without
it
friend
pen
went
about
at
clavering
laboriously
simple
and
adroitly
pleased
and
quite
a
different
being
from
the
scornful
and
rather
sulky
young
dandy
whom
the
inhabitants
remembered
ten
years
ago
the
rectory
was
shut
up
doctor
portman
was
gone
with
his
gout
and
his
family
to
harrogate
an
event
which
pen
deplored
very
much
in
a
letter
to
the
doctor
in
which
in
a
few
kind
and
simple
words
he
expressed
his
regret
at
not
seeing
his
old
friend
whose
advice
he
wanted
and
whose
aid
he
might
require
some
day
but
pen
consoled
himself
for
the
doctor
absence
by
making
acquaintance
with
simcoe
the
opposition
preacher
and
with
the
two
partners
of
the
at
chatteris
and
with
the
independent
preacher
there
all
of
whom
he
met
at
clavering
athenaeum
which
the
liberal
party
had
set
up
in
accordance
with
the
advanced
spirit
of
the
age
and
perhaps
in
opposition
to
the
aristocratic
old
into
which
the
edinburgh
review
had
once
scarcely
got
an
admission
and
where
no
tradesmen
were
allowed
an
entrance
he
propitiated
the
younger
partner
of
the
by
asking
him
to
dine
in
a
friendly
way
at
the
park
he
complimented
the
honourable
simcoe
with
hares
and
partridges
from
the
same
quarter
and
a
request
to
read
her
husband
last
sermon
and
being
a
little
unwell
one
day
the
rascal
took
advantage
of
the
circumstance
to
show
his
tongue
to
huxter
who
sent
him
medicines
and
called
the
next
morning
how
delighted
old
pendennis
would
have
been
with
his
pupil
pen
himself
was
amused
with
the
sport
in
which
he
was
engaged
and
his
success
inspired
him
with
a
wicked
and
yet
as
he
walked
out
of
clavering
of
a
night
after
presiding
at
a
meeting
of
the
athenaeum
or
working
through
an
evening
with
simcoe
who
with
her
husband
was
awed
by
the
young
reputation
and
had
heard
of
his
social
successes
as
he
passed
over
the
old
familiar
bridge
of
the
rushing
brawl
and
heard
that
sound
of
waters
beneath
and
saw
his
own
cottage
of
fairoaks
among
the
trees
their
darkling
outlines
clear
against
the
starlit
sky
different
thoughts
no
doubt
came
to
the
young
man
mind
and
awakened
pangs
of
grief
and
shame
there
there
still
used
to
be
a
light
in
the
windows
of
the
room
which
he
remembered
so
well
and
in
which
the
saint
who
loved
him
had
passed
so
many
hours
of
care
and
yearning
and
prayer
he
turned
away
his
gaze
from
the
faint
light
which
seemed
to
pursue
him
with
its
wan
reproachful
gaze
as
though
it
was
his
mother
spirit
watching
and
warning
how
clear
the
night
was
how
keen
the
stars
shone
how
ceaseless
the
rush
of
the
flowing
waters
the
old
home
trees
whispered
and
waved
gently
their
dark
heads
and
branches
over
the
cottage
roof
yonder
in
the
faint
starlight
glimmer
was
the
terrace
where
as
a
boy
he
walked
of
summer
evenings
ardent
and
trustful
unspotted
untried
ignorant
of
doubts
or
passions
sheltered
as
yet
from
the
contamination
in
the
pure
and
anxious
bosom
of
love
the
clock
of
the
near
town
tolling
midnight
with
a
clang
disturbs
our
reverie
and
sends
him
onwards
towards
his
night
through
the
lodge
into
clavering
avenue
and
under
the
dark
arcades
of
the
rustling
limes
when
he
sees
the
cottage
the
next
time
it
is
smiling
in
sunset
those
bedroom
windows
are
open
where
the
light
was
burning

night

himself
for
not

upon

frankly
owning
that
he

not

to
do
it
i

about

jumps
into
an
it
was

father
and
arthur
remembers
the
days
when
he
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
mounting
the
king
throne
as
of
seating
himself
in
that
he
asks
if
miss
stokes
she
is
the
very
image
of
her
mamma
if
she
can
play
he
should
like
to
hear
a
tune
on
that
piano
she
plays
he
hears
the
notes
of
the
old
piano
once
more
enfeebled
by
age
but
he
does
not
listen
to
the
player
he
is
listening
to
laura
singing
as
in
the
days
of
their
youth
and
sees
his
mother
bending
and
beating
time
over
the
shoulder
of
the
girl

dinner
at
fairoaks
given
in
pen
honour
by
his
tenant
and
at
which
old
stokes
captain
glanders
squire
hobnel
and
the
clergyman
and
his
lady
from
tinckleton
were
present
was
very
stupid
and
melancholy
for
pen
until
the
waiter
from
clavering
who
aided
the
and
stokes
butler
whom
pen
remembered
as
a
street
boy
and
who
was
now
indeed
barber
in
that
place
dropped
a
plate
over
pen
shoulder
on
which
hobnell
who
also
employed
him
remarked
i
suppose
hodson
your
hands
are
slippery
with
always
dropping
the
crockery
about
that
hodson
is
haw
haw
on
which
hodson
blushed
and
looked
so
disconcerted
that
pen
burst
out
laughing
and
and
hilarity
were
the
order
of
the
evening
for
the
second
course
there
was
a
hare
and
partridges
top
and
bottom
and
when
after
the
withdrawal
of
the
servants
pen
said
to
the
vicar
of
tinckleton
i
think
stooks
you
should
have
asked
hodson
to
cut
the
hare
the
joke
was
taken
instantly
by
the
clergyman
who
was
followed
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
by
captains
stokes
and
glanders
and
by
hobnell
who
arrived
rather
late
but
with
an
immense
guffaw
while
mr
pen
was
engaged
in
the
country
in
the
above
schemes
it
happened
that
the
lady
of
his
choice
if
not
of
his
affections
came
up
to
london
from
the
tunbridge
villa
bound
upon
shopping
expeditions
or
important
business
and
in
company
of
old
bonner
her
maid
who
had
lived
and
quarrelled
with
blanche
many
times
since
she
was
an
infant
and
who
now
being
about
to
quit
lady
clavering
service
for
the
hymeneal
state
was
anxious
like
a
good
soul
to
bestow
some
token
of
respectful
kindness
upon
her
old
and
young
mistress
before
she
quitted
them
altogether
to
take
her
post
as
the
wife
of
lightfoot
and
landlady
of
the
clavering
arms
the
honest
woman
took
the
benefit
of
miss
amory
taste
to
make
the
purchase
which
she
intended
to
offer
her
ladyship
and
requested
the
fair
blanche
to
choose
something
for
herself
that
should
be
to
her
liking
and
remind
her
of
her
old
nurse
who
had
attended
her
through
many
a
wakeful
night
and
eventful
teething
and
childish
fever
and
who
loved
her
like
a
child
of
her
own
these
purchases
were
made
and
as
the
nurse
insisted
on
buying
an
immense
bible
for
blanche
the
young
lady
suggested
that
bonner
should
purchase
a
large
johnson
dictionary
for
her
mamma
each
of
the
two
women
might
certainly
profit
by
the
present
made
to
her
then
bonner
invested
money
in
some
bargains
in
which
might
be
useful
at
the
clavering
arms
and
bought
a
red
and
yellow
which
blanche
could
see
at
once
was
intended
for
lightfoot
younger
than
herself
by
at
least
years
bonner
regarded
that
youth
with
a
fondness
at
once
parental
and
conjugal
and
loved
to
lavish
ornaments
on
his
person
which
already
glittered
with
pins
rings
and
chains
and
seals
purchased
at
the
good
creature
expense
it
was
in
the
strand
that
bonner
made
her
purchases
aided
by
miss
blanche
who
liked
the
fun
very
well
and
when
the
old
lady
had
bought
everything
that
she
desired
and
was
leaving
the
shop
blanche
with
a
smiling
face
and
a
sweet
bow
to
one
of
the
shopmen
said
pray
sir
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
show
us
the
way
to
shepherd
inn
shepherd
inn
was
but
a
few
score
of
yards
off
old
castle
street
was
close
by
the
elegant
young
shopman
pointed
out
the
turning
which
the
young
lady
was
to
take
and
she
and
her
companion
walked
off
together
shepherd
inn
what
can
you
want
in
shepherd
inn
miss
blanche
bonner
inquired
mr

you
want
to
go

see
the
captain
i
should
like
to
see
the
captain
very
well
i

want
to
see
a
dear
little
good
girl
who
was
very
kind
to
to
arthur
when
he
was
so
ill
last
year
and
saved
his
life
almost
and
i
want
to
thank
her
and
ask
her
if
she
would
like
anything
i
looked
out
several
of
my
dresses
on
purpose
this
morning
bonner
and
she
looked
at
bonner
as
if
she
had
a
right
to
admiration
and
had
performed
an
act
of
remarkable
virtue
blanche
indeed
was
very
fond
of
she
would
have
fed
the
poor
upon
them
when
she
had
had
enough
and
given
a
country
girl
a
when
she
had
worn
it
and
was
tired
of
it
pretty
girl
pretty
young
woman
mumbled
bonner
i
know
i
want
no
pretty
young
women
to
come
about
lightfoot
and
in
imagination
she
peopled
the
clavering
arms
with
a
harem
of
the
most
hideous
chambermaids
and
barmaids
blanche
with
pink
and
blue
and
feathers
and
flowers
and
trinkets
that
wondrous
invention
a
chatelaine
was
not
extant
yet
or
she
would
have
had
one
we
may
be
sure
and
a
dress
and
a

a
charming
parasol

a
vision
of
elegance
and
beauty
such
as
bewildered
the
eyes
of
bolton
who
was
scrubbing
the
of
shepherd
inn
and
caused
and
to
look
with
delight
blanche
looked
on
them
with
a
smile
of
ineffable
sweetness
and
protection
like
rowena
going
to
see
rebecca
like
marie
antoinette
visiting
the
poor
in
the
famine
like
the
marchioness
of
carabas
alighting
from

at
a
door
and
taking
from

packet
of
epsom

a
queen
stepping
down
from
her
throne
to
visit
a
subject
and
enjoyed
all
the
bland
consciousness
of
doing
a
good
action
my
good
woman
i
want
to
see
fanny
fanny

is
she
here
bolton

a
sudden
suspicion
from
the
splendour
of
appearance
that
it
must
be
a
or
something
worse
what
do
you
want
with
fanny
pray
she
asked
i

lady

daughter
you
have
heard
of
sir
francis
clavering
and
i
wish
very
much
indeed
to
see
fanny
pray
step
in
where
fanny
said
fanny
had
gone
into
no
staircase
on
which
bolton
said
she
was
probably
in
strong
rooms
and
bade
the
child
go
and
see
if
she
was
there
in
captain
strong
rooms
oh
let
us
go
to
captain
strong
rooms
cried
out
miss

i
know
him
very
well
you
dearest
little
girl
show
us
the
way
to
captain
strong
cried
out
miss
blanche
for
the
floor
reeked
with
the
recent
scrubbing
and
the
goddess
did
not
like
the
smell
of
and
as
they
passed
up
the
stairs
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
costigan
who
happened
to
be
swaggering
about
the
court
and
gave
a
very
knowing
look
with
his
oi
under
blanche
bonnet
remarked
to
himself
a
devilish
foine
gyurll
bedad
goan
up
to
sthrong
and
altamont
always
having
foine
gyurlls
up
their
hallo
hwhat
that
he
presently
said
looking
up
at
the
windows
from
which
some
piercing
shrieks
issued
at
the
sound
of
the
voice
of
a
distressed
female
the
intrepid
cos
rushed
up
the
stairs
as
fast
as
his
old
legs
would
carry
him
being
nearly
overthrown
by
strong
servant
who
was
descending
the
stair
cos
found
the
outer
door
of
strong
chambers
opened
and
began
to
thunder
at
the
knocker
after
many
and
fierce
knocks
the
inner
door
was
partially
unclosed
and
strong
head
appeared
it
oi
me
boy
hwhat
that
noise
sthrong
asked
costigan
go
to
the
d
was
the
only
answer
and
the
door
was
shut
on
venerable
red
nose
and
he
went
downstairs
muttering
threats
at
the
indignity
offered
to
him
and
vowing
that
he
would
have
satisfaction
in
the
meanwhile
the
reader
more
lucky
than
captain
costigan
will
have
the
privilege
of
being
made
acquainted
with
the
secret
which
was
withheld
from
that
officer
it
has
been
said
of
how
generous
a
disposition
altamont
was
and
when
he
was
well
supplied
with
funds
how
liberally
he
spent
them
of
a
hospitable
turn
he
had
no
greater
pleasure
than
drinking
in
company
with
other
people
so
that
there
was
no
man
more
welcome
at
greenwich
and
richmond
than
the
emissary
of
the
nawaub
of
lucknow
now
it
chanced
that
on
the
day
when
blanche
and
bonner
ascended
the
staircase
to
strong
room
in
shepherd
inn
the
colonel
had
invited
miss
delaval
of
the
theatre
royal
and
her
mother
hodge
to
a
little
party
down
the
river
and
it
had
been
agreed
that
they
were
to
meet
at
chambers
and
thence
walk
down
to
a
port
in
the
neighbouring
strand
to
take
water
so
that
when
bonner
and
mes
larmes
came
to
the
door
where
grady
altamont
servant
was
standing
the
domestic
said
walk
in
ladies
with
the
utmost
affability
and
led
them
into
the
room
which
was
arranged
as
if
they
had
been
expected
there
indeed
two
bouquets
of
flowers
bought
at
covent
garden
that
morning
and
instances
of
the
tender
gallantry
of
altamont
were
awaiting
his
guests
upon
the
table
blanche
smelt
at
the
bouquet
and
put
her
pretty
little
dainty
nose
into
it
and
tripped
about
the
room
and
looked
behind
the
curtains
and
at
the
books
and
prints
and
at
the
plan
of
clavering
estate
hanging
up
on
the
wall
and
had
asked
the
servant
for
captain
strong
and
had
almost
forgotten
his
existence
and
the
errand
about
which
she
had
come
namely
to
visit
fanny
bolton
so
pleased
was
she
with
the
new
adventure
and
the
odd
strange
delightful
droll
little
idea
of
being
in
a
bachelor
chambers
in
a
queer
old
place
in
the
city
grady
meanwhile
with
a
pair
of
ample
varnished
boots
had
disappeared
into
his
master
room
blanche
had
hardly
the
leisure
to
remark
how
big
the
boots
were
and
how
unlike
strong
the
women
come
said
grady
helping
his
master
to
the
boots
did
you
ask
if
they
would
take
a
glass
of
anything
asked
altamont
grady
came
out
he
says
will
you
take
anything
to
drink
the
domestic
asked
of
them
at
which
blanche
amused
with
the
artless
question
broke
out
into
a
pretty
little
laugh
and
asked
of
bonner
shall
we
take
anything
to
drink
well
you
may
take
it
or
lave
it
said
grady
who
thought
his
offer
slighted
and
did
not
like
the
contemptuous
manners
of
the
and
so
left
them
will
we
take
anything
to
drink
blanche
asked
again
and
again
began
to
laugh
grady
bawled
out
a
voice
from
the
chamber
within
a
voice
that
made
bonner
start
grady
did
not
answer
his
song
was
heard
from
afar
off
from
the
kitchen
his
upper
room
where
grady
was
singing
at
his
work
grady
my
coat
again
roared
the
voice
from
within
why
that
is
not
strong
voice
said
the
sylphide
still
half
laughing
grady
my
coat
bonner
who
is
grady
my
coat
we
ought
to
go
bonner
still
looked
quite
puzzled
at
the
sound
of
the
voice
which
she
had
heard
the
bedroom
door
here
opened
and
the
individual
who
had
called
out
grady
my
coat
appeared
without
the
garment
in
question
he
nodded
to
the
women
and
walked
across
the
room
i
beg
your
pardon
ladies
grady
bring
my
coat
down
sir
well
my
dears
it
a
fine
day
and
we
have
a
jolly
lark
at
he
said
no
more
for
here
bonner
who
had
been
looking
at
him
with
scared
eyes
suddenly
shrieked
out
amory
amory
and
fell
back
screaming
and
fainting
in
her
chair
the
man
so
apostrophised
looked
at
the
woman
an
instant
and
rushing
up
to
blanche
seized
her
and
kissed
her
yes
betsy
he
said
by
g
it
is
me
mary
bonner
knew
me
what
a
fine
gal

grown
but

my
betsy
d

i
love

i
your
old
betsy
or
blanche
looked
quite
bewildered
and
began
to
scream
too
once
twice
thrice
and
it
was
her
piercing
shrieks
which
captain
costigan
heard
as
he
walked
the
court
below
at
the
sound
of
these
shrieks
the
perplexed
parent
clasped
his
hands
his
wristbands
were
open
and
on
one
brawny
arm
you
could
see
letters
tattooed
in
blue
and
rushing
to
his
apartment
came
back
with
an
bottle
from
his
grand
silver
with
the
fragrant
contents
of
which
he
began
liberally
to
sprinkle
bonner
and
blanche
the
screams
of
these
women
brought
the
other
occupants
of
the
chambers
into
the
room
grady
from
his
kitchen
and
strong
from
his
apartment
in
the
upper
story
the
latter
at
once
saw
from
the
aspect
of
the
two
women
what
had
occurred
grady
go
and
wait
in
the
court
he
said
and
if
anybody
comes
you
understand
is
it
the
and
her
mother
said
grady
yes
confound
you
say
that
there
nobody
in
chambers
and
the
off
for
shall
i
say
that
sir
and
after
i
bought
them
bokays
asked
grady
of
his
master
yes
said
amory
with
a
stamp
of
his
foot
and
strong
going
to
the
door
too
reached
it
just
in
time
to
prevent
the
entrance
of
captain
costigan
who
had
mounted
the
stair
the
ladies
from
the
theatre
did
not
have
their
treat
to
greenwich
nor
did
blanche
pay
her
visit
to
fanny
bolton
on
that
day
and
cos
who
took
occasion
majestically
to
inquire
of
grady
what
the
mischief
was
and
who
was
crying
had
for
answer
that
was
a
woman
another
of
them
and
that
they
were
in
grady
opinion
the
cause
of
all
the
mischief
in
the
world
chapter
lxvii
in
which
pen
begins
to
doubt
about
his
election
whilst
pen
in
his
own
county
was
thus
carrying
on
his
selfish
plans
and
parliamentary
schemes
news
came
to
him
that
lady
rockminster
had
arrived
at
baymouth
and
had
brought
with
her
our
friend
laura
at
the
announcement
that
laura
his
sister
was
near
him
pen
felt
rather
guilty
his
wish
was
to
stand
higher
in
her
esteem
perhaps
than
in
that
of
any
other
person
in
the
world
she
was
his
mother
legacy
to
him
he
was
to
be
her
patron
and
protector
in
some
sort
how
would
she
brave
the
news
which
he
had
to
tell
her
and
how
should
he
explain
the
plans
which
he
was
meditating
he
felt
as
if
neither
he
nor
blanche
could
bear
dazzling
glance
of
calm
scrutiny
and
as
if
he
would
not
dare
to
disclose
his
worldly
hopes
and
ambitions
to
that
spotless
judge
at
her
arrival
at
baymouth
he
wrote
a
letter
thither
which
contained
a
great
number
of
fine
phrases
and
protests
of
affection
and
a
great
deal
of
easy
satire
and
raillery
in
the
midst
of
all
which
mr
pen
could
not
help
feeling
that
he
was
in
panic
and
that
he
was
acting
like
a
rogue
and
hypocrite
how
was
it
that
a
simple
country
girl
should
be
the
object
of
fear
and
trembling
to
such
an
accomplished
gentleman
as
mr
pen
his
worldly
tactics
and
diplomacy
his
satire
and
knowledge
of
the
world
could
not
bear
the
test
of
her
purity
he
felt
somehow
and
he
had
to
own
to
himself
that
his
affairs
were
in
such
a
position
that
he
could
not
tell
the
truth
to
that
honest
soul
as
he
rode
from
clavering
to
baymouth
he
felt
as
guilty
as
a
schoolboy
who
does
know
his
lesson
and
is
about
to
face
the
awful
master
for
is
not
truth
the
master
always
and
does
she
not
have
the
power
and
hold
the
book
under
the
charge
of
her
kind
though
somewhat
wayward
and
absolute
patroness
lady
rockminster
laura
had
seen
somewhat
of
the
world
in
the
last
year
had
gathered
some
accomplishments
and
profited
by
the
lessons
of
society
many
a
girl
who
had
been
accustomed
to
that
too
great
tenderness
in
which
laura
early
life
had
been
passed
would
have
been
unfitted
for
the
changed
existence
which
she
now
had
to
lead
helen
worshipped
her
two
children
and
thought
as
women
will
that
all
the
world
was
made
for
them
or
to
be
considered
after
them
she
tended
laura
with
a
watchfulness
of
affection
which
never
left
her
if
she
had
a
headache
the
widow
was
as
alarmed
as
if
there
had
never
been
an
aching
head
before
in
the
world
she
slept
and
woke
read
and
moved
under
her
mother
fond
superintendence
which
was
now
withdrawn
from
her
along
with
the
tender
creature
whose
anxious
heart
would
beat
no
more
and
painful
moments
of
grief
and
depression
no
doubt
laura
had
when
she
stood
in
the
great
careless
world
alone
nobody
heeded
her
griefs
or
her
solitude
she
was
not
quite
the
equal
in
social
rank
of
the
lady
whose
companion
she
was
or
of
the
friends
and
relatives
of
the
imperious
but
kind
old
dowager
some
very
likely
bore
her
no
goodwill
some
perhaps
slighted
her
it
might
have
been
that
servants
were
occasionally
rude
their
mistress
certainly
was
often
laura
not
seldom
found
herself
in
family
meetings
the
confidence
and
familiarity
of
which
she
felt
were
interrupted
by
her
intrusion
and
her
sensitiveness
of
course
was
wounded
at
the
idea
that
she
should
give
or
feel
this
annoyance
how
many
governesses
are
there
in
the
world
thought
cheerful
laura
how
many
ladies
whose
necessities
make
them
slaves
and
companions
by
profession
what
bad
tempers
and
coarse
unkindness
have
not
these
to
encounter
how
infinitely
better
my
lot
is
with
these
really
kind
and
affectionate
people
than
that
of
thousands
of
unprotected
girls
it
was
with
this
cordial
spirit
that
our
young
lady
adapted
herself
to
her
new
position
and
went
in
advance
of
her
fortune
with
a
trustful
smile
did
you
ever
know
a
person
who
met
fortune
in
that
way
whom
the
goddess
did
not
regard
kindly
are
not
even
bad
people
won
by
a
constant
cheerfulness
and
a
pure
and
affectionate
heart
when
the
babes
in
the
wood
in
the
ballad
looked
up
fondly
and
trustfully
at
those
notorious
rogues
whom
their
uncle
had
set
to
make
away
with
the
little
folks
we
all
know
how
one
of
the
rascals
relented
and
made
away
with
the
other
not
having
the
heart
to
be
unkind
to
so
much
innocence
and
beauty
oh
happy
they
who
have
that
virgin
loving
trust
and
sweet
smiling
confidence
in
the
world
and
fear
no
evil
because
they
think
none
miss
laura
bell
was
one
of
these
fortunate
persons
and
besides
the
gentle
widow
little
cross
which
as
we
have
seen
pen
gave
her
had
such
a
sparkling
and
brilliant
kohinoor
in
her
bosom
as
is
even
more
precious
than
that
famous
jewel
for
it
not
only
fetches
a
price
and
is
retained
by
its
owner
in
another
world
where
diamonds
are
stated
to
be
of
no
value
but
here
too
is
of
inestimable
worth
to
its
possessor
is
a
talisman
against
evil
and
lightens
up
the
darkness
of
life
like
cogia
hassan
famous
stone
so
that
before
miss
bell
had
been
a
year
in
lady
rockminster
house
there
was
not
a
single
person
in
it
whose
love
she
had
not
won
by
the
use
of
this
talisman
from
the
old
lady
to
the
lowest
dependent
of
her
bounty
laura
had
secured
the
goodwill
and
kindness
of
everybody
with
a
mistress
of
such
a
temper
my
lady
woman
who
had
endured
her
mistress
for
forty
years
and
had
been
clawed
and
scolded
and
jibed
every
day
and
night
in
that
space
of
time
could
not
be
expected
to
have
a
good
temper
of
her
own
and
was
at
first
angry
against
miss
laura
as
she
had
been
against
her
ladyship
fifteen
preceding
companions
but
when
laura
was
ill
at
paris
this
old
woman
nursed
her
in
spite
of
her
mistress
who
was
afraid
of
catching
the
fever
and
absolutely
fought
for
her
medicine
with
martha

fairoaks

to

she
was

to
kill
her

happy
to

when

those
two
footmen

considerable

some
time

so
enthusiastic
as
to

a

agreeable
person

that

kindness
laura
had
acquired
not
by
any
arts
not
by
any
flattery
but
by
the
simple
force
of
and
by
the
blessed
gift
of
pleasing
and
being
pleased
on
the
one
or
two
occasions
when
he
had
seen
lady
rockminster
the
old
lady
who
did
not
admire
him
had
been
very
pitiless
and
abrupt
with
our
young
friend
and
perhaps
pen
expected
when
he
came
to
baymouth
to
find
laura
installed
in
her
house
in
the
quality
of
humble
companion
and
treated
no
better
than
himself
when
she
heard
of
his
arrival
she
came
running
downstairs
and
i
am
not
sure
that
she
did
not
embrace
him
in
the
presence
of
calverley
and
coldstream
not
that
those
gentlemen
ever
told
if
the
fractus
orbis
had
come
to
a
smash
if
laura
instead
of
kissing
pen
had
taken
her
scissors
and
snipped
off
his
head
calverley
and
coldstream
would
have
looked
on
impavidly
without
allowing
a
grain
of
powder
to
be
disturbed
by
the
calamity
laura
had
so
much
improved
in
health
and
looks
that
pen
could
not
but
admire
her
the
frank
and
kind
eyes
which
met
his
beamed
with
the
cheek
which
he
kissed
blushed
with
beauty
as
he
looked
at
her
artless
and
graceful
pure
and
candid
he
thought
he
had
never
seen
her
so
beautiful
why
should
he
remark
her
beauty
now
so
much
and
remark
too
to
himself
that
he
had
not
remarked
it
sooner
he
took
her
fair
trustful
hand
and
kissed
it
fondly
he
looked
in
her
bright
clear
eyes
and
read
in
them
that
kindling
welcome
which
he
was
always
sure
to
find
there
he
was
affected
and
touched
by
the
tender
tone
and
the
pure
sparkling
glance
their
innocence
smote
him
somehow
and
moved
him
how
good
you
are
to
me
laura
sister
said
pen
i
do
deserve
that
you
should
that
you
should
be
so
kind
to
mamma
left
you
to
me
she
said
stooping
down
and
brushing
his
forehead
with
her
lips
hastily
you
know
you
were
to
come
to
me
when
you
were
in
trouble
or
to
tell
me
when
you
were
very
happy
that
was
our
compact
arthur
last
year
before
we
parted
are
you
very
happy
now
or
are
you
in
trouble
which
is
it
and
she
looked
at
him
with
an
arch
glance
of
kindness
do
you
like
going
into
parliament
do
you
intend
to
distinguish
yourself
there
how
i
shall
tremble
for
your
first
speech
do
you
know
about
the
parliament
plan
then
pen
asked
know
all
the
world
knows
i
have
heard
it
talked
about
many
times
lady
rockminster
doctor
talked
about
it
i
daresay
it
will
be
in
the
chatteris
paper
it
is
all
over
the
county
that
sir
francis
clavering
of
clavering
is
going
to
retire
in
behalf
of
arthur
pendennis
of
fairoaks
and
that
the
young
and
beautiful
miss
blanche
amory
is
what
that
too
asked
pendennis
that
too
dear
arthur
tout
se
sait
as
somebody
would
say
whom
i
intend
to
be
very
fond
of
and
who
i
am
sure
is
very
clever
and
pretty
i
have
had
a
letter
from
blanche
the
kindest
of
letters
she
speaks
so
warmly
of
you
arthur
i
hope
i
know
she
feels
what
she
when
is
it
to
be
arthur
why
did
you
not
tell
me
i
may
come
and
live
with
you
then
may
i
my
home
is
yours
dear
laura
and
everything
i
have
pen
said
if
i
did
not
tell
you
it
was
because
because
i
do
not
know
nothing
is
decided
as
yet
no
words
have
passed
between
us
but
you
think
blanche
could
be
happy
with
me
do
you
not
a
romantic
fondness
you
know
i
have
no
heart
i
think
i
told
her
so
only
a
attachment
and
want
my
wife
on
one
side
of
the
fire
and
my
sister
on
the
other
parliament
in
the
session
and
fairoaks
in
the
holidays
and
my
laura
never
to
leave
me
until
somebody
who
has
a
right
comes
to
take
her
somebody
who
has
a
right
somebody
with
a
right
why
did
pen
as
he
looked
at
the
girl
and
slowly
uttered
the
words
begin
to
feel
angry
and
jealous
of
the
invisible
somebody
with
the
right
to
take
her
away
anxious
but
a
minute
ago
how
she
would
take
the
news
regarding
his
probable
arrangements
with
blanche
pen
was
hurt
somehow
that
she
received
the
intelligence
so
easily
and
took
his
happiness
for
granted
until
somebody
comes
laura
said
with
a
laugh
i
will
stay
at
home
and
be
aunt
laura
and
take
care
of
the
children
when
blanche
is
in
the
world
i
have
arranged
it
all
i
am
an
excellent
housekeeper
do
you
know
i
have
been
to
market
at
paris
with
beck
and
have
taken
some
lessons
from
grandjean
and
i
have
had
some
lessons
in
paris
in
singing
too
with
the
money
which
you
sent
me
you
kind
boy
and
i
can
sing
much
better
now
and
i
have
learned
to
dance
though
not
so
well
as
blanche
and
when
you
become
a
minister
of
state
blanche
shall
present
me
and
with
this
and
with
a
provoking
she
performed
for
him
the
last
parisian
curtsey
lady
rockminster
came
in
whilst
this
curtsey
was
being
performed
and
gave
to
arthur
one
finger
to
shake
which
he
took
and
over
which
he
bowed
as
well
as
he
could
which
in
truth
was
very
clumsily
so
you
are
going
to
be
married
sir
said
the
old
lady
scold
him
lady
rockminster
for
not
telling
us
laura
said
going
away
which
in
truth
the
old
lady
began
instantly
to
do
so
you
are
going
to
marry
and
to
go
into
parliament
in
place
of
that
sir
francis
clavering
i
wanted
him
to
give
my
grandson
his
seat
why
did
he
not
give
my
grandson
his
seat
i
hope
you
are
to
have
a
great
deal
of
money
with
miss
amory
i
would
take
her
without
a
great
sir
francis
clavering
is
tired
of
parliament
pen
said
wincing
and
and
i
rather
wish
to
attempt
that
career
the
rest
of
the
story
is
at
least
i
wonder
when
you
had
laura
at
home
you
could
take
up
with
such
an
affected
little
creature
as
that
the
old
lady
continued
i
am
very
sorry
miss
amory
does
not
please
your
ladyship
said
pen
smiling
you
mean
that
it
is
no
affair
of
mine
and
that
i
am
not
going
to
marry
her
well
i
not
and
i
very
glad
i
am
not
a
little
odious
thing
when
i
think
that
a
man
could
prefer
her
to
my
laura
i
no
patience
with
him
and
so
i
tell
you
arthur
i
am
very
glad
you
see
laura
with
such
favourable
eyes
pen
said
you
are
very
glad
and
you
are
very
sorry
what
does
it
matter
sir
whether
you
are
very
glad
or
very
sorry
a
young
man
who
prefers
miss
amory
to
miss
bell
has
no
business
to
be
sorry
or
glad
a
young
man
who
takes
up
with
such
a
crooked
lump
of
affectation
as
that
little
amory
for
she
is
crooked
i
tell
you
she
is
after
seeing
my
laura
has
no
right
to
hold
up
his
head
again
where
is
your
friend
bluebeard
the
tall
young
man
i
mean
warrington
is
his
name
why
does
he
not
come
down
and
marry
laura
what
do
the
young
men
mean
by
not
marrying
such
a
girl
as
that
they
all
marry
for
money
now
you
are
all
selfish
and
cowards
we
ran
away
with
each
other
and
made
foolish
matches
in
my
time
i
have
no
patience
with
the
young
men
when
i
was
at
paris
in
the
winter
i
asked
all
the
three
attaches
at
the
embassy
why
they
did
not
fall
in
love
with
miss
bell
they
laughed
they
said
they
wanted
money
you
are
all
selfish
you
are
all
i
hope
before
you
offered
miss
bell
to
the
attaches
said
pen
with
some
heat
you
did
her
the
favour
to
consult
her
miss
bell
has
only
a
little
money
miss
bell
must
marry
soon
somebody
must
make
a
match
for
her
sir
and
a
girl
ca
offer
herself
said
the
old
dowager
with
great
state
laura
my
dear
i
been
telling
your
cousin
that
all
the
young
men
are
selfish
and
that
there
is
not
a
pennyworth
of
romance
left
among
them
he
is
as
bad
as
the
have
you
been
asking
arthur
why
he
wo
marry
me
said
laura
with
a
kindling
smile
coming
back
and
taking
her
cousin
hand
she
had
been
away
perhaps
to
hide
some
traces
of
emotion
which
she
did
not
wish
others
to
see
he
is
going
to
marry
somebody
else
and
i
intend
to
be
very
fond
of
her
and
to
go
and
live
with
them
provided
he
then
does
not
ask
every
bachelor
who
comes
to
his
house
why
he
does
not
marry
me
the
terrors
of
pen
conscience
being
thus
appeased
and
his
examination
before
laura
over
without
any
reproaches
on
the
part
of
the
latter
pen
began
to
find
that
his
duty
and
inclination
led
him
constantly
to
baymouth
where
lady
rockminster
informed
him
that
a
place
was
always
reserved
for
him
at
her
table
and
i
recommend
you
to
come
often
the
old
lady
said
for
grandjean
is
an
excellent
cook
and
to
be
with
laura
and
me
will
do
your
manners
good
it
is
easy
to
see
that
you
are
always
thinking
about
yourself
do
blush
and
stammer
almost
all
young
men
are
always
thinking
about
themselves
my
sons
and
grandsons
always
were
until
i
cured
them
come
here
and
let
us
teach
you
to
behave
properly
you
will
not
have
to
carve
that
is
done
at
the
hecker
will
give
you
as
much
wine
as
is
good
for
you
and
on
days
when
you
are
very
good
and
amusing
you
shall
have
some
champagne
hecker
mind
what
i
say
pendennis
is
miss
laura
brother
and
you
will
make
him
comfortable
and
see
that
he
does
not
have
too
much
wine
or
disturb
me
whilst
i
am
taking
my
nap
after
dinner
you
are
selfish
i
intend
to
cure
you
of
being
selfish
you
will
dine
here
when
you
have
no
other
engagements
and
if
it
rains
you
had
better
put
up
at
the
as
long
as
the
good
lady
could
order
everybody
round
about
her
she
was
not
hard
to
please
and
all
the
slaves
and
subjects
of
her
little
dowager
court
trembled
before
her
but
loved
her
she
did
not
receive
a
very
numerous
or
brilliant
society
the
doctor
of
course
was
admitted
as
a
constant
and
faithful
visitor
the
vicar
and
his
curate
and
on
public
days
the
vicar
wife
and
daughters
and
some
of
the
season
visitors
at
baymouth
were
received
at
the
old
entertainments
but
generally
the
company
was
a
small
one
and
arthur
drank
his
wine
by
himself
when
lady
rockminster
retired
to
take
her
doze
and
to
be
played
and
sung
to
sleep
by
laura
after
dinner
if
my
music
can
give
her
a
nap
said
the
girl
ought
i
not
to
be
very
glad
that
it
can
do
so
much
good
lady
rockminster
sleeps
very
little
of
nights
and
i
used
to
read
to
her
until
i
fell
ill
at
paris
since
when
she
will
not
hear
of
my
sitting
why
did
you
not
write
to
me
when
you
were
ill
asked
pen
with
a
blush
what
good
could
you
do
me
i
had
martha
to
nurse
me
and
the
doctor
every
day
you
are
too
busy
to
write
to
women
or
to
think
about
them
you
have
your
books
and
your
newspapers
and
your
politics
and
your
railroads
to
occupy
you
i
wrote
when
i
was
and
pen
looked
at
her
and
blushed
again
as
he
remembered
that
during
all
the
time
of
her
illness
he
had
never
written
to
her
and
had
scarcely
thought
about
her
in
consequence
of
his
relationship
pen
was
free
to
walk
and
ride
with
his
cousin
constantly
and
in
the
course
of
those
walks
and
rides
could
appreciate
the
sweet
frankness
of
her
disposition
and
the
truth
simplicity
and
kindliness
of
her
fair
and
spotless
heart
in
their
mother
lifetime
she
had
never
spoken
so
openly
or
so
cordially
as
now
the
desire
of
poor
helen
to
make
an
union
between
her
two
children
had
caused
a
reserve
on
laura
part
towards
pen
for
which
under
the
altered
circumstances
of
arthur
life
there
was
now
no
necessity
he
was
engaged
to
another
woman
and
laura
became
his
sister
at
once
hiding
or
banishing
from
herself
any
doubts
which
she
might
have
as
to
his
choice
striving
to
look
cheerfully
forward
and
hope
for
his
prosperity
promising
herself
to
do
all
that
affection
might
do
to
make
her
mother
darling
happy
their
talk
was
often
about
the
departed
mother
and
it
was
from
a
thousand
stories
which
laura
told
him
that
arthur
was
made
aware
how
constant
and
absorbing
that
silent
maternal
devotion
had
been
which
had
accompanied
him
present
and
absent
through
life
and
had
only
ended
with
the
fond
widow
last
breath
one
day
the
people
in
clavering
saw
a
lad
in
charge
of
a
couple
of
horses
at
the
and
it
was
told
over
the
place
that
pen
and
laura
had
visited
helen
grave
together
since
arthur
had
come
down
into
the
country
he
had
been
there
once
or
twice
but
the
sight
of
the
sacred
stone
had
brought
no
consolation
to
him
a
guilty
man
doing
a
guilty
deed
a
mere
speculator
content
to
lay
down
his
faith
and
honour
for
a
fortune
and
a
worldly
career
and
owning
that
his
life
was
but
a
contemptible
surrender
what
right
had
he
in
the
holy
place
what
booted
it
to
him
in
the
world
he
lived
in
that
others
were
no
better
than
himself
arthur
and
laura
rode
by
the
gates
of
fairoaks
and
he
shook
hands
with
his
tenant
children
playing
on
the
lawn
and
the
terrace
laura
looked
steadily
at
the
cottage
wall
at
the
creeper
on
the
porch
and
the
magnolia
growing
up
to
her
window
mr
pendennis
rode
by
one
of
the
boys
told
his
mother
with
a
lady
and
he
stopped
and
talked
to
us
and
he
asked
for
a
bit
of
honeysuckle
off
the
porch
and
gave
it
the
lady
i
could
see
if
she
was
pretty
she
had
her
veil
down
she
was
riding
one
of
cramp
horses
out
of
as
they
rode
over
the
downs
between
home
and
baymouth
pen
did
not
speak
much
though
they
rode
very
close
together
he
was
thinking
what
a
mockery
life
was
and
how
men
refuse
happiness
when
they
may
have
it
or
having
it
kick
it
down
or
barter
it
with
their
eyes
open
for
a
little
worthless
money
or
beggarly
honour
and
then
the
thought
came
what
does
it
matter
for
the
little
space
the
lives
of
the
best
and
purest
of
us
are
consumed
in
a
vain
desire
and
end
in
a
disappointment
as
the
dear
soul
who
sleeps
in
her
grave
yonder
she
had
her
selfish
ambition
as
much
as
caesar
had
and
died
baulked
of
her
longing
the
stone
covers
over
our
hopes
and
our
memories
our
place
knows
us
not
other
people
children
are
playing
on
the
grass
he
broke
out
in
a
hard
voice
where
you
and
i
used
to
play
laura
and
you
see
how
the
magnolia
we
planted
has
grown
up
since
our
time
i
have
been
round
to
one
or
two
of
the
cottages
where
my
mother
used
to
visit
it
is
scarcely
more
than
a
year
that
she
is
gone
and
the
people
whom
she
used
to
benefit
care
no
more
for
her
death
than
for
queen
anne
we
are
all
selfish
the
world
is
selfish
there
are
but
a
few
exceptions
like
you
my
dear
to
shine
like
good
deeds
in
a
naughty
world
and
make
the
blackness
more
i
wish
you
would
not
speak
in
that
way
arthur
said
laura
looking
down
and
bending
her
head
to
the
honeysuckle
on
her
breast
when
you
told
the
little
boy
to
give
me
this
you
were
not
a
pretty
sacrifice
i
made
to
get
it
for
you
said
the
sneerer
but
your
heart
was
kind
and
full
of
love
when
you
did
so
one
can
not
ask
for
more
than
love
and
kindness
and
if
you
think
humbly
of
yourself
arthur
the
love
and
kindness
are
diminished
are
they
i
often
thought
our
dearest
mother
spoiled
you
at
home
by
worshipping
you
and
that
if
you
are
i
hate
the
word
what
you
say
her
too
great
fondness
helped
to
make
you
so
and
as
for
the
world
when
men
go
out
into
it
i
suppose
they
can
not
be
otherwise
than
selfish
you
have
to
fight
for
yourself
and
to
get
on
for
yourself
and
to
make
a
name
for
yourself
mamma
and
your
uncle
both
encouraged
you
in
this
ambition
if
it
is
a
vain
thing
why
pursue
it
i
suppose
such
a
clever
man
as
you
intend
to
do
a
great
deal
of
good
to
the
country
by
going
into
parliament
or
you
would
not
wish
to
be
there
what
are
you
going
to
do
when
you
are
in
the
house
of
commons
women
do
understand
about
politics
my
dear
pen
said
sneering
at
himself
as
he
spoke
but
why
do
you
make
us
understand
i
could
never
tell
about
pynsent
why
he
should
like
to
be
there
so
much
he
is
not
a
clever
man
he
certainly
is
not
a
genius
pynsent
said
pen
lady
diana
says
that
he
attends
committees
all
day
that
then
again
he
is
at
the
house
all
night
that
he
always
votes
as
he
is
told
that
he
never
speaks
that
he
will
never
get
on
beyond
a
subordinate
place
and
as
his
grandmother
tells
him
he
is
choked
with
are
you
going
to
follow
the
same
career
arthur
what
is
there
in
it
so
brilliant
that
you
should
be
so
eager
for
it
i
would
rather
that
you
should
stop
at
home
and
write
books
good
books
kind
books
with
gentle
kind
thoughts
such
as
you
have
dear
arthur
and
such
as
might
do
people
good
to
read
and
if
you
do
not
win
fame
what
then
you
own
it
is
vanity
and
you
can
live
very
happily
without
it
i
must
not
pretend
to
advise
but
i
take
you
at
your
own
word
about
the
world
and
as
you
own
it
is
wicked
and
that
it
tires
you
ask
you
why
you
do
leave
it
and
what
would
you
have
me
do
asked
arthur
i
would
have
you
bring
your
wife
to
fairoaks
to
live
there
and
study
and
do
good
round
about
you
i
would
like
to
see
your
own
children
playing
on
the
lawn
arthur
and
that
we
might
pray
in
our
church
again
once
more
dear
brother
if
the
world
is
a
temptation
are
we
not
told
to
pray
that
we
may
not
be
led
into
it
do
you
think
blanche
would
make
a
good
wife
for
a
petty
country
gentleman
do
you
think
i
should
become
the
character
very
well
laura
pen
asked
remember
temptation
walks
about
the
hedgerows
as
well
as
the
city
streets
and
idleness
is
the
greatest
tempter
of
what
does
does
warrington
say
said
laura
as
a
blush
mounted
up
to
her
cheek
and
of
which
pen
saw
the
fervour
though
laura
veil
fell
over
her
face
to
hide
it
pen
rode
on
by
laura
side
silently
for
a
while
george
name
so
mentioned
brought
back
the
past
to
him
and
the
thoughts
which
he
had
once
had
regarding
george
and
laura
why
should
the
recurrence
of
the
thought
agitate
him
now
that
he
knew
the
union
was
impossible
why
should
he
be
curious
to
know
if
during
the
months
of
their
intimacy
laura
had
felt
a
regard
for
warrington
from
that
day
until
the
present
time
george
had
never
alluded
to
his
story
and
arthur
remembered
now
that
since
then
george
had
scarcely
ever
mentioned
laura
name
at
last
he
cane
close
to
her
tell
me
something
laura
he
said
she
put
back
her
veil
and
looked
at
him
what
is
it
arthur
she
asked
though
from
the
tremor
of
her
voice
she
guessed
very
well
tell
me
but
for
george
misfortune
i
never
knew
him
speak
of
it
before
or
since
that
day
would
you
would
you
have
given
him
what
you
refused
me
yes
pen
she
said
bursting
into
tears
he
deserved
you
better
than
i
did
poor
arthur
groaned
forth
with
an
indescribable
pang
at
his
heart
i
am
but
a
selfish
wretch
and
george
is
better
nobler
truer
than
i
am
god
bless
him
yes
pen
said
laura
reaching
out
her
hand
to
her
cousin
and
he
put
his
arm
round
her
and
for
a
moment
she
sobbed
on
his
shoulder
the
gentle
girl
had
had
her
secret
and
told
it
in
the
widow
last
journey
from
fairoaks
when
hastening
with
her
mother
to
laura
had
made
a
different
confession
and
it
was
only
when
warrington
told
his
own
story
and
described
the
hopeless
condition
of
his
life
that
she
discovered
how
much
her
feelings
had
changed
and
with
what
tender
sympathy
with
what
great
respect
delight
and
admiration
she
had
grown
to
regard
her
cousin
friend
until
she
knew
that
some
plans
she
might
have
dreamed
of
were
impossible
and
that
warrington
reading
in
her
heart
perhaps
had
told
his
melancholy
story
to
warn
her
she
had
not
asked
herself
whether
it
was
possible
that
her
affections
could
change
and
had
been
shocked
and
seared
by
the
discovery
of
the
truth
how
should
she
have
told
it
to
helen
and
confessed
her
shame
poor
laura
felt
guilty
before
her
friend
with
the
secret
which
she
dared
not
confide
to
her
felt
as
if
she
had
been
ungrateful
for
helen
love
and
regard
felt
as
if
she
had
been
wickedly
faithless
to
pen
in
withdrawing
that
love
from
him
which
he
did
not
even
care
to
accept
humbled
even
and
repentant
before
warrington
lest
she
should
have
encouraged
him
by
undue
sympathy
or
shown
the
preference
which
she
began
to
feel
the
catastrophe
which
broke
up
laura
home
and
the
grief
and
anguish
which
she
felt
for
her
mother
death
gave
her
little
leisure
for
thoughts
more
selfish
and
by
the
time
she
rallied
from
that
grief
the
minor
one
was
also
almost
cured
it
was
but
for
a
moment
that
she
had
indulged
a
hope
about
warrington
her
admiration
and
respect
for
him
remained
as
strong
as
ever
but
the
tender
feeling
with
which
she
knew
she
had
regarded
him
was
schooled
into
such
calmness
that
it
may
be
said
to
have
been
dead
and
passed
away
the
pang
which
it
left
behind
was
one
of
humility
and
remorse
oh
how
wicked
and
proud
i
was
about
arthur
she
thought
how
and
unforgiving
i
never
forgave
from
my
heart
this
poor
girl
who
was
fond
of
him
or
him
for
encouraging
her
love
and
i
have
been
more
guilty
than
she
poor
little
artless
creature
i
professing
to
love
one
man
could
listen
to
another
only
too
eagerly
and
would
not
pardon
the
change
of
feelings
in
arthur
whilst
i
myself
was
changing
and
unfaithful
and
so
humiliating
herself
and
acknowledging
her
weakness
the
poor
girl
sought
for
strength
and
refuge
in
the
manner
in
which
she
had
been
accustomed
to
look
for
them
she
had
done
no
wrong
but
there
are
some
folks
who
suffer
for
a
fault
ever
so
trifling
as
much
as
others
whose
stout
consciences
can
walk
under
crimes
of
almost
any
weight
and
poor
laura
chose
to
fancy
that
she
had
acted
in
this
delicate
juncture
of
her
life
as
a
very
great
criminal
she
determined
that
she
had
done
pen
a
great
injury
by
withdrawing
that
love
which
privately
in
her
mother
hearing
she
had
bestowed
upon
him
that
she
had
been
ungrateful
to
her
dead
benefactress
by
ever
allowing
herself
to
think
of
another
or
of
violating
her
promise
and
that
considering
her
own
enormous
crimes
she
ought
to
be
very
gentle
in
judging
those
of
others
whose
temptations
were
much
greater
very
likely
and
whose
motives
she
could
not
understand
a
year
back
laura
would
have
been
indignant
at
the
idea
that
arthur
should
marry
blanche
and
her
high
spirit
would
have
risen
as
she
thought
that
from
worldly
motives
he
should
stoop
to
one
so
unworthy
now
when
the
news
was
brought
to
her
of
such
a
chance
the
intelligence
was
given
to
her
by
old
lady
rockminster
whose
speeches
were
as
direct
and
rapid
as
a
slap
on
the
face
the
humbled
girl
winced
a
little
at
the
blow
but
bore
it
meekly
and
with
a
desperate
acquiescence
he
has
a
right
to
marry
he
knows
a
great
deal
more
of
the
world
than
i
do
she
argued
with
herself
blanche
may
not
be
so
as
she
seemed
and
who
am
i
to
be
her
judge
i
daresay
it
is
very
good
that
arthur
should
go
into
parliament
and
distinguish
himself
and
my
duty
is
to
do
everything
that
lies
in
my
power
to
aid
him
and
blanche
and
to
make
his
home
happy
i
daresay
i
shall
live
with
them
if
i
am
godmother
to
one
of
their
children
i
will
leave
her
my
three
thousand
pounds
and
forthwith
she
began
to
think
what
she
could
give
blanche
out
of
her
small
treasures
and
how
best
to
conciliate
her
affection
she
wrote
her
forthwith
a
kind
letter
in
which
of
course
no
mention
was
made
of
the
plans
in
contemplation
but
in
which
laura
recalled
old
times
and
spoke
her
goodwill
and
in
reply
to
this
she
received
an
eager
answer
from
blanche
in
which
not
a
word
about
marriage
was
said
to
be
sure
but
pendennis
was
mentioned
two
or
three
times
in
the
letter
and
they
were
to
be
henceforth
dearest
laura
and
dearest
blanche
and
loving
sisters
and
so
forth
when
pen
and
laura
reached
home
after
laura
confession
pen
noble
acknowledgment
of
his
own
inferiority
and
generous
expression
of
love
for
warrington
causing
the
girl
heart
to
throb
and
rendering
doubly
keen
those
tears
which
she
sobbed
on
his
shoulder
a
little
slim
letter
was
awaiting
miss
bell
in
the
hall
which
she
trembled
rather
guiltily
as
she
unsealed
and
which
pen
blushed
as
he
recognised
for
he
saw
instantly
that
it
was
from
blanche
laura
opened
it
hastily
and
cast
her
eyes
quickly
over
it
as
pen
kept
his
fixed
on
her
blushing
she
dates
from
london
laura
said
she
has
been
with
old
bonner
lady
clavering
maid
bonner
is
going
to
marry
lightfoot
the
butler
where
do
you
think
blanche
has
been
she
cried
out
eagerly
to
paris
to
scotland
to
the
casino
to
shepherd
inn
to
see
fanny
but
fanny
was
there
and
blanche
is
going
to
leave
a
present
for
her
is
it
kind
of
her
and
thoughtful
and
she
handed
the
letter
to
pen
who
read
saw
madame
mere
who
was
scrubbing
the
room
and
looked
at
me
with
very
scrubby
looks
but
la
belle
fanny
was
not
au
logis
and
as
i
heard
that
she
was
in
captain
strong
apartments
bonner
and
i
mounted
au
troisieme
to
see
this
famous
beauty
another
disappointment
only
the
chevalier
strong
and
a
friend
of
his
in
the
room
so
we
came
away
after
all
without
seeing
the
enchanting
fanny
mille
et
mille
baisers
when
will
that
horrid
canvassing
be
over
sleeves
are
worn
etc
etc
etc
after
dinner
the
doctor
was
reading
the
times
a
young
gentleman
i
attended
when
he
was
here
some
eight
or
nine
years
ago
has
come
into
a
fine
fortune
the
doctor
said
i
see
here
announced
the
death
of
john
henry
foker
of
logwood
hall
at
pau
in
the
pyrenees
on
the
chapter
lxviii
in
which
the
major
is
bidden
to
stand
and
deliver
any
gentleman
who
has
frequented
the
wheel
of
fortune
where
it
may
be
remembered
that
james
morgan
club
was
held
and
where
sir
francis
clavering
had
an
interview
with
major
pendennis
is
aware
that
there
are
three
rooms
for
guests
upon
the
ground
floor
besides
the
bar
where
the
landlady
sits
one
is
a
parlour
frequented
by
the
public
at
large
to
another
room
gentlemen
in
livery
resort
and
the
third
apartment
on
the
door
of
which
private
is
painted
is
that
hired
by
the
club
of
the
confidentials
of
which
messrs
morgan
and
lightfoot
were
members
the
noiseless
morgan
had
listened
to
the
conversation
between
strong
and
major
pendennis
at
the
latter
own
lodgings
and
had
carried
away
from
it
matter
for
much
private
speculation
and
a
desire
of
knowledge
had
led
him
to
follow
his
master
when
the
major
came
to
the
wheel
of
fortune
and
to
take
his
place
quietly
in
the
confidential
room
whilst
pendennis
and
clavering
had
their
discourse
in
the
parlour
there
was
a
particular
corner
in
the
confidential
room
from
which
you
could
hear
almost
all
that
passed
in
the
next
apartment
and
as
the
conversation
between
the
two
gentlemen
there
was
rather
angry
and
carried
on
in
a
high
key
morgan
had
the
benefit
of
overhearing
almost
the
whole
of
it
and
what
he
heard
strengthened
the
conclusions
which
his
mind
had
previously
formed
he
knew
altamont
at
once
did
he
when
he
saw
him
in
sydney
clavering
ai
no
more
married
to
my
lady
than
i
am
altamont
the
man
altamont
a
convict
young
harthur
comes
into
parlyment
and
the
promises
not
to
split
by
jove
what
a
sly
old
rogue
it
is
that
old
no
wonder
he
anxious
to
make
the
match
between
blanche
and
harthur
why
she
have
a
hundred
thousand
if
she
a
penny
and
bring
her
man
a
seat
in
parlyment
into
the
nobody
saw
but
a
physiognomist
would
have
liked
to
behold
the
expression
of
countenance
when
this
astounding
intelligence
was
made
clear
to
him
but
for
my
hage
and
the
confounded
preudices
of
society
he
said
surveying
himself
in
the
glass
dammy
james
morgan
you
might
marry
her
but
if
he
could
not
marry
miss
blanche
and
her
fortune
morgan
thought
he
could
mend
his
own
by
the
possession
of
this
information
and
that
it
might
be
productive
of
benefit
to
him
from
very
many
sources
of
all
the
persons
whom
the
secret
affected
the
greater
number
would
not
like
to
have
it
known
for
instance
sir
francis
clavering
whose
fortune
it
involved
would
wish
to
keep
it
quiet
colonel
altamont
whose
neck
it
implicated
would
naturally
be
desirous
to
hush
it
and
that
young
hupstart
beast
harthur
who
was
for
getting
into
parlyment
on
the
strenth
of
it
and
was
as
proud
as
if
he
was
a
duke
with
half
a
millium
a
year
such
we
grieve
to
say
was
morgan
opinion
of
his
employer
nephew
would
pay
anythink
sooner
than
let
the
world
know
that
he
was
married
to
a
convick
daughter
and
had
got
his
seat
in
parlyment
by
trafficking
with
this
secret
as
for
lady
morgan
thought
if
she
tired
of
clavering
and
wants
to
get
rid
of
him
she
pay
if
she
frightened
about
her
son
and
fond
of
the
little
beggar
she
pay
all
the
same
and
miss
blanche
will
certainly
come
down
handsome
to
the
man
who
will
put
her
into
her
rights
which
she
was
unjustly
defrauded
of
them
and
no
mistake
dammy
concluded
the
valet
reflecting
upon
this
wonderful
hand
which
luck
had
given
him
to
play
with
such
cards
as
these
james
morgan
you
are
a
made
man
it
may
be
a
enewity
to
me
every
one
of
must
susscribe
and
with
what
i
made
already
i
may
cut
business
give
my
old
warning
turn
gentleman
and
have
a
servant
of
my
own
entertaining
himself
with
calculations
such
as
these
that
were
not
a
little
likely
to
perturb
a
man
spirit
morgan
showed
a
very
great
degree
of
by
appearing
and
being
calm
and
by
not
allowing
his
future
prospects
in
any
way
to
interfere
with
his
present
duties
one
of
the
persons
whom
the
story
chiefly
concerned
colonel
altamont
was
absent
from
london
when
morgan
was
thus
made
acquainted
with
his
history
the
valet
knew
of
sir
francis
clavering
shepherd
inn
haunt
and
walked
thither
an
hour
or
two
after
the
baronet
and
pendennis
had
had
their
conversation
together
but
that
bird
was
flown
colonel
altamont
had
received
his
derby
winnings
and
was
gone
to
the
continent
the
fact
of
his
absence
was
exceedingly
vexatious
to
morgan
drop
all
that
money
at
the
on
the
rhind
thought
morgan
and
i
might
have
had
a
good
bit
of
it
it
confounded
annoying
to
think
he
gone
and
could
have
waited
a
few
days
hope
triumphant
or
deferred
ambition
or
disappointment
victory
or
patient
ambush
morgan
bore
all
alike
with
similar
equable
countenance
until
the
proper
day
came
the
major
boots
were
varnished
and
his
hair
was
curled
his
early
cup
of
tea
was
brought
to
his
bedside
his
oaths
rebukes
and
senile
satire
borne
with
silent
obsequious
fidelity
who
would
think
to
see
him
waiting
upon
his
master
packing
and
shouldering
his
trunks
and
occasionally
assisting
at
table
at
the
where
he
might
be
staying
that
morgan
was
richer
than
his
employer
and
knew
his
secrets
and
other
people
in
the
profession
morgan
was
greatly
respected
and
admired
and
his
reputation
for
wealth
and
wisdom
got
him
much
renown
at
most
the
younger
gentlemen
voted
him
stoopid
a
feller
of
no
idears
and
a
fogey
in
a
word
but
not
one
of
them
would
not
say
amen
to
the
heartfelt
prayer
which
some
of
the
most
among
the
gentlemen
uttered
when
i
die
may
i
cut
up
as
well
as
morgan
pendennis
as
became
a
man
of
fashion
major
pendennis
spent
the
autumn
passing
from
house
to
house
of
such
country
friends
as
were
at
home
to
receive
him
and
if
the
duke
happened
to
be
abroad
the
marquis
in
scotland
condescending
to
sojourn
with
sir
john
or
the
plain
squire
to
say
the
truth
the
old
gentleman
reputation
was
somewhat
on
the
wane
many
of
the
men
of
his
time
had
died
out
and
the
occupants
of
their
halls
and
the
present
wearers
of
their
titles
knew
not
major
pendennis
and
little
cared
for
his
traditions
of
the
wild
prince
and
poins
and
of
the
heroes
of
fashion
passed
away
it
must
have
struck
the
good
man
with
melancholy
as
he
walked
by
many
a
london
door
to
think
how
seldom
it
was
now
opened
for
him
and
how
often
he
used
to
knock
at
it
to
what
banquets
and
welcome
he
used
to
pass
through
it
a
score
of
years
back
he
began
to
own
that
he
was
no
longer
of
the
present
age
and
dimly
to
apprehend
that
the
young
men
laughed
at
him
such
melancholy
musings
must
come
across
many
a
pall
mall
philosopher
the
men
thinks
he
are
not
such
as
they
used
to
be
in
his
time
the
old
grand
manner
and
courtly
grace
of
life
are
gone
what
is
castlewood
house
and
the
present
castlewood
compared
to
the
magnificence
of
the
old
mansion
and
owner
the
late
lord
came
to
london
with
four
postchaises
and
sixteen
horses
all
the
north
road
hurried
out
to
look
at
his
cavalcade
the
people
in
london
streets
even
stopped
as
his
procession
passed
them
the
present
lord
travels
with
five
bagmen
in
a
railway
carriage
and
sneaks
away
from
the
station
smoking
a
cigar
in
a
brougham
the
late
lord
in
autumn
filled
castlewood
with
company
who
drank
claret
till
midnight
the
present
man
buries
himself
in
a
hut
on
a
scotch
mountain
and
passes
november
in
two
or
three
closets
in
an
entresol
at
paris
where
his
amusements
are
a
dinner
at
a
cafe
and
a
box
at
a
little
theatre
what
a
contrast
there
is
between
his
lady
lorraine
the
regent
lady
lorraine
and
her
little
ladyship
of
the
present
era
he
figures
to
himself
the
first
beautiful
gorgeous
magnificent
in
diamonds
and
velvets
daring
in
rouge
the
wits
of
the
world
the
old
wits
the
old
polished
gentlemen
not
the
canaille
of
with
their
language
of
the
cabstand
and
their
coats
smelling
of
smoke
bowing
at
her
feet
and
then
thinks
of
lady
lorraine
a
little
woman
in
a
black
silk
gown
like
a
governess
who
talks
astronomy
and
labouring
classes
and
emigration
and
the
deuce
knows
what
and
lurks
to
church
at
eight
in
the
morning
that
used
to
be
the
noblest
house
in
the
county
is
turned
into
a
monastery
a
regular
la
trappe
they
do
drink
two
glasses
of
wine
after
dinner
and
every
other
man
at
table
is
a
country
curate
with
a
white
neckcloth
whose
talk
is
about
polly
higson
progress
at
school
or
widow
watkins
lumbago
and
the
other
young
men
those
lounging
guardsmen
and
great
lazy
dandies
sprawling
over
sofas
and
and
stealing
off
to
smoke
pipes
in
each
other
bedrooms
caring
for
nothing
reverencing
nothing
not
even
an
old
gentleman
who
has
known
their
fathers
and
their
betters
not
even
a
pretty
woman
what
a
difference
there
is
between
these
men
who
poison
the
very
turnips
and
with
their
tobacco
and
the
gentlemen
of
our
time
thinks
the
major
the
breed
is
gone
there
no
use
for
they
replaced
by
a
parcel
of
damned
and
utilitarians
and
young
sprigs
of
parsons
with
their
hair
combed
down
their
barks
i
getting
old
they
getting
past
me
they
laugh
at
us
old
boys
thought
old
pendennis
and
he
was
not
far
wrong
the
times
and
manners
which
he
admired
were
pretty
nearly
gone
the
gay
young
men
larked
him
irreverently
whilst
the
serious
youth
had
a
grave
pity
and
wonder
at
him
which
would
have
been
even
more
painful
to
bear
had
the
old
gentleman
been
aware
of
its
extent
but
he
was
rather
simple
his
examination
of
moral
questions
had
never
been
very
deep
it
had
never
struck
him
perhaps
until
very
lately
that
he
was
otherwise
than
a
most
respectable
and
rather
fortunate
man
is
there
no
old
age
but
his
without
reverence
did
youthful
folly
never
jeer
at
other
bald
pates
for
the
past
two
or
three
years
he
had
begun
to
perceive
that
his
day
was
over
and
that
the
men
of
the
new
time
had
begun
to
reign
after
a
rather
unsuccessful
autumn
season
then
during
which
he
was
faithfully
followed
by
morgan
his
nephew
arthur
being
engaged
as
we
have
seen
at
clavering
it
happened
that
major
pendennis
came
back
for
a
while
to
london
at
the
dismal
end
of
october
when
the
fogs
and
the
lawyers
come
to
town
who
has
not
looked
with
interest
at
those
loaded
cabs
piled
boxes
and
crowded
children
rattling
through
the
streets
on
the
dun
october
evenings
stopping
at
the
dark
houses
where
they
discharge
nurse
and
infant
girls
matron
and
father
whose
holidays
are
over
yesterday
it
was
france
and
sunshine
or
broadstairs
and
liberty
comes
work
and
a
yellow
fog
and
ye
gods
what
a
heap
of
bills
there
lies
in
master
study
and
the
clerk
has
brought
the
lawyer
papers
from
chambers
and
in
half
an
hour
the
literary
man
knows
that
the
printer
boy
will
be
in
the
passage
and
smith
with
that
little
account
that
particular
little
account
has
called
presentient
of
your
arrival
and
has
left
word
that
he
will
call
morning
at
ten
who
amongst
us
has
not
said
to
his
holiday
returned
to
dun
london
and
his
fate
surveyed
his
labours
and
liabilities
laid
out
before
him
and
been
aware
of
that
inevitable
little
account
to
settle
smith
and
his
little
account
in
the
morning
symbolise
duty
difficulty
struggle
which
you
will
meet
let
us
hope
friend
with
a
manly
and
honest
and
you
think
of
him
as
the
children
are
slumbering
once
more
in
their
own
beds
and
the
watchful
housewife
tenderly
pretends
to
sleep
old
pendennis
had
no
special
labours
or
bills
to
encounter
on
the
morrow
as
he
had
no
affection
at
home
to
soothe
him
he
had
always
money
in
his
desk
sufficient
for
his
wants
and
being
by
nature
and
habit
tolerably
indifferent
to
the
wants
of
other
people
these
latter
were
not
likely
to
disturb
him
but
a
gentleman
may
be
out
of
temper
though
he
does
not
owe
a
shilling
and
though
he
may
be
ever
so
selfish
he
must
occasionally
feel
dispirited
and
lonely
he
had
had
two
or
three
twinges
of
gout
in
the
where
he
had
been
staying
the
birds
were
wild
and
shy
and
the
walking
over
the
ploughed
fields
had
fatigued
him
deucedly
the
young
men
had
laughed
at
him
and
he
had
been
peevish
at
table
once
or
twice
he
had
not
been
able
to
get
his
whist
of
an
evening
and
in
fine
was
glad
to
come
away
in
all
his
dealings
with
morgan
his
valet
he
had
been
exceedingly
sulky
and
discontented
he
had
sworn
at
him
and
abused
him
for
many
days
past
he
had
scalded
his
mouth
with
bad
soup
at
swindon
he
had
left
his
umbrella
in
the
railroad
carriage
at
which
piece
of
forgetfulness
he
was
in
such
a
rage
that
he
cursed
morgan
more
freely
than
ever
both
the
chimneys
smoked
furiously
in
his
lodgings
and
when
he
caused
the
windows
to
be
flung
open
he
swore
so
acrimoniously
that
morgan
was
inclined
to
fling
him
out
of
window
too
through
that
opened
casement
the
valet
swore
after
his
master
as
pendennis
went
down
the
street
on
his
way
to
the
club
bays
was
not
at
all
pleasant
the
house
had
been
new
painted
and
smelt
of
varnish
and
turpentine
and
a
large
streak
of
white
paint
inflicted
itself
on
the
back
of
the
old
boy
surtout
the
dinner
was
not
good
and
the
three
most
odious
men
in
all
london
old
hawkshaw
whose
cough
and
accompaniments
are
fit
to
make
any
man
uncomfortable
old
colonel
gripley
who
seizes
on
all
the
newspapers
and
that
irreclaimable
old
bore
jawkins
who
would
come
and
dine
at
the
next
table
to
pendennis
and
describe
to
him
every
which
he
had
paid
in
his
foreign
tour
each
and
all
of
these
disagreeable
personages
and
incidents
had
contributed
to
make
major
pendennis
miserable
and
the
club
waiter
trod
on
his
toe
as
he
brought
him
his
coffee
never
alone
appear
the
immortals
the
furies
always
hunt
in
company
they
pursued
pendennis
from
home
to
the
club
and
from
the
club
home
whilst
the
major
was
absent
from
his
lodgings
morgan
had
been
seated
in
the
landlady
parlour
drinking
freely
of
hot
and
pouring
out
on
brixham
some
of
the
abuse
which
he
had
received
from
his
master
upstairs
brixham
was
morgan
slave
he
was
his
landlady
landlord
he
had
bought
the
lease
of
the
house
which
she
rented
he
had
got
her
name
and
her
son
to
acceptances
and
a
bill
of
sale
which
made
him
master
of
the
luckless
widow
furniture
the
young
brixham
was
a
clerk
in
an
insurance
office
and
morgan
could
put
him
into
what
he
called
quod
any
day
brixham
was
a
clergyman
widow
and
morgan
after
performing
his
duties
on
the
first
floor
had
a
pleasure
in
making
the
old
lady
fetch
him
his
bootjack
and
his
slippers
she
was
his
slave
the
little
black
profiles
of
her
son
and
daughter
the
very
picture
of
tiddlecot
church
where
she
was
married
and
her
poor
dear
brixham
lived
and
died
was
now
morgan
property
as
it
hung
there
over
the
mantelpiece
of
his
morgan
sate
in
the
widow
in
the
old
making
brixham
bring
supper
for
him
and
fill
his
glass
again
and
again
the
liquor
was
bought
with
the
poor
woman
own
coin
and
hence
morgan
indulged
in
it
only
the
more
freely
and
he
had
eaten
his
supper
and
was
drinking
a
third
tumbler
when
old
pendennis
returned
from
the
club
and
went
upstairs
to
his
rooms
morgan
swore
very
savagely
at
him
and
his
bell
when
he
heard
the
latter
and
finished
his
tumbler
of
brandy
before
he
went
up
to
answer
the
summons
he
received
the
abuse
consequent
on
this
delay
in
silence
nor
did
the
major
condescend
to
read
in
the
flushed
face
and
glaring
eyes
of
the
man
the
anger
under
which
he
was
labouring
the
old
was
at
the
fire
his
gown
and
slippers
awaiting
him
there
morgan
knelt
down
to
take
his
boots
off
with
due
subordination
and
as
the
major
abused
him
from
above
kept
up
a
growl
of
maledictions
below
at
his
feet
thus
when
pendennis
was
crying
confound
you
sir
mind
that
strap
curse
you
do
wrench
my
foot
off
morgan
sotto
voce
below
was
expressing
a
wish
to
strangle
him
drown
him
and
punch
his
head
off
the
boots
removed
it
became
necessary
to
divest
pendennis
of
his
coat
and
for
this
purpose
the
valet
had
necessarily
to
approach
very
near
to
his
employer
so
near
that
pendennis
could
not
but
perceive
what
morgan
late
occupation
had
been
to
which
he
adverted
in
that
simple
and
forcible
phraseology
which
men
are
sometimes
in
the
habit
of
using
to
their
domestics
informing
morgan
that
he
was
a
drunken
beast
and
that
he
smelt
of
brandy
at
this
the
man
broke
out
losing
patience
and
flinging
up
all
subordination

i
sitting
in
my
own
chair
in
my
own
room
the
truth
to
you
i
be
your
beast
and
your
brute
and
your
dog
no
more
major
pendennis
alf
the
fury
of
the
old
gentleman
met
by
the
servant
abrupt
revolt
had
been
shocked
and
cooled
by
the
concussion
as
much
as
if
a
sudden
or
a
pail
of
cold
water
had
been
flung
upon
him
that
effect
produced
and
his
anger
calmed
morgan
speech
had
interested
him
and
he
rather
respected
his
adversary
and
his
courage
in
facing
him
as
of
old
days
in
the
he
would
have
admired
the
opponent
who
hit
him
you
are
no
longer
my
servant
the
major
said
and
the
house
may
be
yours
but
the
lodgings
are
mine
and
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
leave
them
morning
when
we
have
settled
our
accounts
i
shall
remove
into
other
quarters
in
the
meantime
i
desire
to
go
to
bed
and
have
not
the
slightest
wish
for
your
further
we
have
a
settlement
do
you
be
afraid
morgan
said
getting
up
from
his
chair
i
ai
done
with
you
yet
nor
with
your
family
nor
with
the
clavering
family
major
pendennis
and
that
you
shall
have
the
goodness
to
leave
the
room
sir
i
tired
said
the
major
hah
you
be
more
tired
of
me
afore
you
done
answered
the
man
with
a
sneer
and
walked
out
of
the
room
leaving
the
major
to
compose
himself
as
best
he
might
after
the
agitation
of
this
extraordinary
scene
he
sate
and
mused
by
his
fireside
over
the
past
events
and
the
confounded
impudence
and
ingratitude
of
servants
and
thought
how
he
should
get
a
new
man
how
devilish
unpleasant
it
was
for
a
man
of
his
age
and
with
his
habits
to
part
with
a
fellow
to
whom
he
had
been
accustomed
how
morgan
had
a
receipt
for
which
was
incomparably
better
and
more
comfortable
to
the
feet
than
any
he
had
ever
tried
how
very
well
he
made
and
tended
him
when
he
was
unwell
gad
it
a
hard
thing
to
lose
a
fellow
of
that
sort
but
he
must
go
thought
the
major
he
has
grown
rich
and
impudent
since
he
has
grown
rich
he
was
horribly
tipsy
and
abusive
we
must
part
and
i
must
go
out
of
the
lodgings
dammy
i
like
the
lodgings
i
used
to
it
very
unpleasant
at
my
time
of
life
to
change
my
and
so
on
mused
the
old
gentleman
the
had
done
him
good
the
testiness
was
gone
the
loss
of
the
umbrella
the
smell
of
paint
at
the
club
were
forgotten
under
the
superior
excitement
confound
the
insolent
villain
thought
the
old
gentleman
he
understood
my
wants
to
a
nicety
he
was
the
best
servant
in
he
thought
about
his
servant
as
a
man
thinks
of
a
horse
that
has
carried
him
long
and
well
and
that
has
come
down
with
him
and
is
safe
no
longer
how
the
deuce
to
replace
him
where
can
he
get
such
another
animal
in
these
melancholy
cogitations
the
major
who
had
donned
his
own
and
replaced
his
head
of
hair
a
little
grey
had
been
introduced
into
the
coiffure
of
late
by
truefitt
which
had
given
the
major
head
the
most
artless
and
respectable
appearance
in
these
cogitations
we
say
the
major
who
had
taken
off
his
wig
and
put
on
his
sate
absorbed
by
the
fireside
when
a
feeble
knock
came
at
his
door
which
was
presently
opened
by
the
landlady
of
the
lodgings
god
bless
my
soul
brixham
cried
out
the
major
startled
that
a
lady
should
behold
him
in
the
simple
appareil
of
his
it
it
very
late
i
wish
i
might
speak
to
you

said
the
landlady
very
piteously
about
morgan
i
suppose
he
has
cooled
himself
at
the
pump

him
back
brixham
impossible
i
determined
to
part
with
him
before
when

dealings

the
discount
business

of
them

my
servant

capitalist

brixham

mr

when

when
i
besought
him
to
have
pity
on
me
and
told
him
he
had
been
the
ruin
of
my
family
said
something
which
i
did
not
well
understand
that
he
would
ruin
every
family
in
the
house
that
he
knew
something
would
bring
you
down
too
and
that
you
should
pay
him
for
your
your
insolence
to
him
i
i
must
own
to
you
that
i
went
down
on
my
knees
to
him
sir
and
he
said
with
a
dreadful
oath
against
you
that
he
would
have
you
on
your
me
by
gad
that
is
too
pleasant
where

the
widow

away
with
this
prayer
to
pass
her
night
as
she
might
and
look
for
the
dreadful
morrow
the
last
words
about
himself
excited
major
pendennis
so
much
that
his
compassion
for
brixham
misfortunes
was
quite
forgotten
in
the
consideration
of
his
own
case
me
on
my
knees
thought
he
as
he
got
into
bed
confound
his
impudence
who
ever
saw
me
on
my
knees
what
the
devil
does
the
fellow
know
gad
i
not
had
an
affair
these
twenty
years
i
defy
and
the
old
compaigner
turned
round
and
slept
pretty
sound
being
rather
excited
and
amused
by
the
events
of
the
day
the
last
day
in
bury
street
he
was
determined
it
should
be
for
it
impossible
to
stay
on
with
a
valet
over
me
and
a
bankrupt
landlady
what
good
can
i
do
this
poor
devil
of
a
woman

give
her
twenty
pound
there

pound
which
he
has
just

and
more
and
that
cormorant
morgan
will
swallow
all
no
dammy
i
ca
afford
to
know
poor
people
and
i
say
to
brixham
and
chapter
lxix
in
which
the
major
neither
yields
his
money
nor
his
life
early
next

opened
by
morgan
who
appeared
as

with
a
face
perfectly
grave
and
respectful

the
old

excessive

almost
as
angry
as
the
major
bitterest
words
and
whilst
the
old
gentleman
is
making
his
mysterious
toilet
we
will
also
modestly

and
his

themselves
in

guarded
and
solemn
he
had
spoken
no
word
as
yet
to
brixham
respecting
his
threats
of
the
past
night
but
he
looked
as
if
he
would
execute
them
and
the
poor

tremblingly
awaited
her
fate
old
pendennis
armed
with
his
cane

and
accounts

simple
and
very
easily

cried
the
old
gentleman
in
the
desk
to
which
the
valet
pointed
was
a
little
pistol
which
had
belonged
to
pendennis
old
patron
the
indian
and
which
had
accompanied
him
in
many
a
campaign

more
word

old
man

you
you
lying
coward
kneel
down
and
say
your
prayers
sir
for
by
the
lord
you
shall
the
major
face
glared
with
rage
at
his
adversary
who
looked
terrified
before
him
for
a
moment
and
at
the
next
with
a
shriek
of
murder
sprang
towards
the
open
window
under
which
a
policeman
happened
to
be
on
his
beat
murder
police
bellowed
morgan
to
his
surprise
major
pendennis
wheeled
away
the
table
and
walked
to
the
other
window
which
was
also
open
he
beckoned
the
policeman
come
up
here
policeman
he
said
and
then
went
and
placed
himself
against
the
door
you
miserable
sneak
he
said
to
morgan
the
pistol
has
been
loaded
these
fifteen
years
as
you
would
have
known
very
well
if
you
had
not
been
such
a
coward
that
policeman
is
coming
and
i
will
have
him
up
and
have
your
trunks
searched
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
you
are
a
thief
sir
i
know
you
are
i
swear
to
the
you
gave
to
me
you
gave
to
me
cried
morgan
the
major
laughed
we
see
he
said
and
the
guilty
valet
remembered
some
fine
shirts
a
certain
cane
an
which
he
had
forgotten
to
bring
down
and
of
which
he
had
assumed
the
use
along
with
certain
articles
of
his
master
clothes
which
the
old
dandy
neither
wore
nor
asked
for
policeman
x
entered
followed
by
the
seared
brixham
and
her
who
had
been
at
the
door
and
found
some
difficulty
in
closing
it
against
the
street
amateurs
who
wished
to
see
the
row
the
major
began
instantly
to
speak
i
have
had
occasion
to
discharge
this
drunken
scoundrel
he
said
both
last
night
and
this
morning
he
insulted
and
assaulted
me
i
am
an
old
man
and
took
up
a
pistol
you
see
it
is
not
loaded
and
this
coward
cried
out
before
he
was
hurt
i
am
glad
you
are
come
i
was
charging
him
with
taking
my
property
and
desired
to
examine
his
trunks
and
his
the
velvet
cloak
you
ai
worn
these
three
years
nor
the
weskits
and
i
thought
i
might
take
the
shirts
and
i
i
take
my
hoath
i
intended
to
put
back
the
roared
morgan
writhing
with
rage
and
terror
the
man
acknowledges
that
he
is
a
thief
the
major
said
calmly
he
has
been
in
my
service
for
years
and
i
have
treated
him
with
every
kindness
and
confidence
we
will
go
upstairs
and
examine
his
in
those
trunks
morgan
had
things
which
he
would
fain
keep
from
public
eyes
morgan
the
gave
goods
as
well
as
money
to
his
customers
he
provided
young
spendthrifts
with
snuff
boxes
and
pins
and
jewels
and
pictures
and
cigars
and
of
a
very
doubtful
quality
those
cigars
and
jewels
and
pictures
were
their
display
at
a
the
discovery
of
his
occult
profession
and
the
exposure
of
the
major
property
which
he
had
appropriated
indeed
rather
than
stolen
would
not
have
added
to
the
reputation
of
morgan
he
looked
a
piteous
image
of
terror
and
discomfiture
he
smash
me
will
he
thought
the
major
i
crush
him
now
and
finish
with
but
he
paused
he
looked
at
poor
brixham
scared
face
and
he
thought
for
a
moment
to
himself
that
the
man
brought
to
bay
and
in
prison
might
make
disclosures
which
had
best
be
kept
secret
and
that
it
was
best
not
to
deal
too
fiercely
with
a
desperate
man
stop
he
said
policeman
i
speak
with
this
man
by
do
you
give
morgan
in
charge
said
the
policeman
i
have
brought
no
charge

the
major
said
with
a
significant
look
at
his
man

the
major
during

years
wrote
morgan

time
by
my
own
care
and
prudence
the
dictator

managed
to

sufficient
money
to

great
a
respect

my
good
man
the
major
answered

on
and
begin
a
new
sentence
having
in
return
for
my
master
kindness
stolen
his
property
from

the
old
fellow
chuckling
at
his

wit
there

unless

i
am
compelled
to
do
so
brixham
and
our
friend
the
policeman
will
witness
it
i

say
without

it
and
i
will
give

of

carried
major
pendennis
boxes
to
the
cabs
in
waiting
and
brixham
when
her
persecutor
was
not
by
came
and
asked
a
blessing
upon
the
major
her
preserver
and
the
best
and
quietest
and
kindest
of
lodgers
and
having
given
her
a
finger
to
shake
which
the
humble
lady
received
with
a
curtsey
and
over
which
she
was
ready
to
make
a
speech
full
of
tears
the
major
cut
short
that
valedictory
oration
and
walked
out
of
the
house
to
the
hotel
in
jermyn
street
which
was
not
many
steps
from
morgan
door
that
individual
looking
forth
from
the
discharged
anything
but
blessings
at
his
parting
guest
but
the
stout
old
boy
could
afford
not
to
be
frightened
at
morgan
and
flung
him
a
look
of
great
contempt
and
humour
as
he
strutted
away
with
his
cane
major
pendennis
had
not
quitted
his
house
of
bury
street
many
hours
and
morgan
was
enjoying
his
otium
in
a
dignified
manner
surveying
the
evening
fog
and
smoking
a
cigar
on
the
when
arthur
pendennis
the
hero
of
this
history
made
his
appearance
at
the
door
my
uncle
out
i
suppose
morgan
he
said
to
the
functionary
knowing
full
well
that
to
smoke
was
treason
in
the
presence
of
the
major
major
pendennis
is
hout
sir
said
morgan
with
gravity
bowing
but
not
touching
the
elegant
cap
which
he
wore
major
pendennis
have
left
this
ouse
sir
and
i
have
no
longer
the
honour
of
being
in
his
service
indeed
and
where
is
he
i
believe
he
ave
taken
tempory
lodgings
at
cox
otel
in
jummin
street
said
morgan
and
added
after
a
pause
are
you
in
town
for
some
time
pray
sir
are
you
in
chambers
i
should
like
to
have
the
honour
of
waiting
on
you
there
and
would
be
thankful
if
you
would
favour
me
with
a
quarter
of
an
do
you
want
my
uncle
to
take
you
back
asked
arthur
insolent
and
i
want
no
such
thing
i
see
him
the
man
glared
at
him
for
a
minute
but
he
stopped
no
sir
thank
you
he
said
in
a
softer
voice
it
only
with
you
that
i
wish
to
speak
on
some
business
which
concerns
you
and
perhaps
you
would
favour
me
by
walking
into
my
if
it
is
but
for
a
minute
or
two
i
will
listen
to
you
morgan
said
arthur
and
thought
to
himself
i
suppose
the
fellow
wants
me
to
patronise
him
and
he
entered
the
house
a
card
was
already
in
the
front
windows
proclaiming
that
apartments
were
to
be
let
and
having
introduced
pendennis
into
the
and
offered
him
a
chair
morgan
took
one
himself
and
proceeded
to
convey
some
information
to
him
of
which
the
reader
has
already
had
cognisance
chapter
lxx
in
which
pendennis
counts
his
eggs
our
friend
had
arrived
in
london
on
that
day
only
though
but
for
a
brief
visit
and
having
left
some
at
an
hotel
to
which
he
had
convoyed
them
from
the
west
he
hastened
to
the
chambers
in
lamb
court
which
were
basking
in
as
much
sun
as
chose
to
visit
that
dreary
but
not
altogether
comfortless
building
freedom
stands
in
lieu
of
sunshine
in
chambers
and
templars
grumble
but
take
their
ease
in
their
inn
pen
domestic
announced
to
him
that
warrington
was
in
chambers
too
and
of
course
arthur
ran
up
to
his
friend
room
straightway
and
found
it
as
of
old
perfumed
with
the
pipe
and
george
once
more
at
work
with
his
newspapers
and
reviews
the
pair
greeted
each
other
with
the
rough
cordiality
which
young
englishmen
use
one
to
another
and
which
carries
a
great
deal
of
warmth
and
kindness
under
its
rude
exterior
warrington
smiled
and
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
said
well
young
one
pen
advanced
and
held
out
his
hand
and
said
how
are
you
old
boy
and
so
this
greeting
passed
between
two
friends
who
had
not
seen
each
other
for
months
alphonse
and
frederic
would
have
rushed
into
each
other
arms
and
shrieked
ce
bon
coeur
ce
cher
alphonse
over
each
other
shoulders
max
and
wilhelm
would
have
bestowed
half
a
dozen
kisses
scented
with
havannah
upon
each
mustachios
well
young
one
how
are
you
old
boy
is
what
two
britons
say
after
saving
each
other
lives
possibly
the
day
before
they
will
leave
off
shaking
hands
and
only
wag
their
heads
at
one
another
as
they
come
to
breakfast
each
has
for
the
other
the
very
warmest
confidence
and
regard
each
would
share
his
purse
with
the
other
and
hearing
him
attacked
would
break
out
in
the
loudest
and
most
enthusiastic
praise
of
his
friend
but
they
part
with
a
mere
they
meet
with
a
mere
and
they
do
write
to
each
other
in
the
interval
curious
modesty
strange
stoical
decorum
of
english
friendship
yes
we
are
not
demonstrative
like
those
confounded
foreigners
says
hardman
who
not
only
shows
no
friendship
but
never
felt
any
all
his
life
long
been
in
switzerland
says
pen
yes
says
warrington
could
find
a
bit
of
tobacco
fit
to
smoke
till
we
came
to
strasburg
where
i
got
some
the
man
mind
is
full
very
likely
of
the
great
sights
which
he
has
seen
of
the
great
emotions
with
which
the
vast
works
of
nature
have
inspired
it
but
his
enthusiasm
is
too
coy
to
show
itself
even
to
his
closest
friend
and
he
veils
it
with
a
cloud
of
tobacco
he
will
speak
more
fully
of
confidential
evenings
however
and
write
ardently
and
frankly
about
that
which
he
is
shy
of
saying
the
thoughts
and
experience
of
his
travel
will
come
forth
in
his
writings
as
the
learning
which
he
never
displays
in
talk
enriches
his
style
with
pregnant
allusion
and
brilliant
illustration
colours
his
generous
eloquence
and
points
his
wit
the
elder
gives
a
rapid
account
of
the
places
which
he
has
visited
in
his
tour
he
has
seen
switzerland
north
italy
and
the
tyrol
he
has
come
home
by
vienna
and
dresden
and
the
rhine
he
speaks
about
these
places
in
a
shy
sulky
voice
as
if
he
had
rather
not
mention
them
at
all
and
as
if
the
sight
of
them
had
rendered
him
very
unhappy
the
outline
of
the
elder
man
tour
thus
gloomily
sketched
out
the
young
one
begins
to
speak
he
has
been
in
the
country
very
much
bored
canvassing
uncommonly
slow
he
is
here
for
a
day
or
two
and
going
on
to
to
the
neighbourhood
of
tunbridge
wells
to
some
friends
that
will
be
uncommonly
slow
too
how
hard
it
is
to
make
an
englishman
acknowledge
that
he
is
happy
and
the
seat
in
parliament
pen
have
you
made
it
all
right
asks
warrington
all
right
as
soon
as
parliament
meets
and
a
new
writ
can
be
issued
clavering
retires
and
i
step
into
his
shoes
says
pen
and
under
which
king
does
bezonian
speak
or
die
asked
warrington
do
we
come
out
as
liberal
conservative
or
as
government
man
or
on
our
own
hook
hem
there
are
no
politics
now
every
man
politics
at
least
are
pretty
much
the
same
i
have
not
got
acres
enough
to
make
me
a
protectionist
nor
could
i
be
one
i
think
if
i
had
all
the
land
in
the
county
i
shall
go
pretty
much
with
government
and
in
advance
of
them
upon
some
social
questions
which
i
have
been
getting
up
during
the
vacation
do
grin
you
old
cynic
i
have
been
getting
up
the
blue
books
and
intend
to
come
out
rather
strong
on
the
sanitary
and
colonisation
we
reserve
to
ourselves
the
liberty
of
voting
against
government
though
we
are
generally
friendly
we
are
however
friends
of
the
people
avant
tout
we
give
lectures
at
the
clavering
institute
and
shake
hands
with
the
intelligent
mechanics
we
think
the
franchise
ought
to
be
very
considerably
enlarged
at
the
same
time
we
are
free
to
accept
office
some
day
when
the
house
has
listened
to
a
few
crack
speeches
from
us
and
the
administration
perceives
our
i
am
not
moses
said
pen
with
as
usual
somewhat
of
melancholy
in
his
voice
i
have
no
laws
from
heaven
to
bring
down
to
the
people
from
the
mountain
i
do
belong
to
the
mountain
at
all
or
set
up
to
be
a
leader
and
reformer
of
mankind
my
faith
is
not
strong
enough
for
that
nor
my
vanity
nor
my
hypocrisy
great
enough
i
will
tell
no
lies
george
that
i
promise
you
and
do
no
more
than
coincide
in
those
which
are
necessary
and
pass
current
and
ca
be
got
in
without
recalling
the
whole
circulation
give
a
man
at
least
the
advantage
of
his
sceptical
turn
if
i
find
a
good
thing
to
say
in
the
house
i
will
say
it
a
good
measure
i
will
support
it
a
fair
place
i
will
take
it
and
be
glad
of
my
luck
but
i
would
no
more
flatter
a
great
man
than
a
mob
and
now
you
know
as
much
about
my
politics
as
i
do
what
call
have
i
to
be
a
whig
whiggism
is
not
a
divine
institution
why
not
vote
with
the
liberal
conservatives
they
have
done
for
the
nation
what
the
whigs
would
never
have
done
without
them
who
converted
both
the
radicals
and
the
country
outside
i
think
the
morning
post
is
often
right
and
punch
is
often
wrong
i
do
profess
a
call
but
take
advantage
of
a
chance
parlons
the
next
thing
at
your
heart
after
ambition
is
love
i
suppose
warrington
said
how
have
our
young
loves
prospered
are
we
going
to
change
our
condition
and
give
up
our
chambers
are
you
going
to
divorce
me
arthur
and
take
unto
yourself
a
wife
i
suppose
so
she
is
very
and
lively
she
sings
and
she
do
mind
smoking
she
have
a
fair
fortune
i
do
know
how
much
but
my
uncle
augurs
everything
from
the
begum
generosity
and
says
that
she
will
come
down
very
handsomely
and
i
think
blanche
is
fond
of
me
said
arthur
with
a
sigh
that
means
that
we
accept
her
caresses
and
her
have
we
said
before
that
life
was
a
transaction
pendennis
said
i
do
pretend
to
break
my
heart
about
her
i
have
told
her
pretty
fairly
what
my
feelings
are
and
and
have
engaged
myself
to
her
and
since
i
saw
her
last
and
for
the
last
two
months
especially
whilst
i
have
been
in
the
country
i
think
she
has
been
growing
fonder
and
fonder
of
me
and
her
letters
to
me
and
especially
to
laura
seem
to
show
it
mine
have
been
simple
enough
no
raptures
nor
vows
you
understand
but
looking
upon
the
thing
as
an
affaire
faite
and
not
desirous
to
hasten
or
defer
the
and
laura
how
is
she
warrington
asked
frankly
laura
george
said
pen
looking
his
friend
hard
in
the
face
by
heaven
laura
is
the
best
and
noblest
and
dearest
girl
the
sun
ever
shone
his
own
voice
fell
as
he
spoke
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
hardly
utter
the
words
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
his
comrade
who
took
it
and
nodded
his
head
have
you
only
found
out
that
now
young
un
warrington
said
after
a
pause
who
has
not
learned
things
too
late
george
cried
arthur
in
his
impetuous
way
gathering
words
and
emotion
as
he
went
on
whose
life
is
not
a
disappointment
who
carries
his
heart
entire
to
the
grave
without
a
mutilation
i
never
knew
anybody
who
was
happy
quite
or
who
has
not
had
to
ransom
himself
out
of
the
hands
of
fate
with
the
payment
of
some
dearest
treasure
or
other
lucky
if
we
are
left
alone
afterwards
when
we
have
paid
our
fine
and
if
the
tyrant
visits
us
no
more
suppose
i
have
found
out
that
i
have
lost
the
greatest
prize
in
the
world
now
that
it
ca
be
mine
that
for
years
i
had
an
angel
under
my
tent
and
let
her
go
am
i
the
only
one
ah
dear
old
boy
am
i
the
only
one
and
do
you
think
my
lot
is
easier
to
bear
because
i
own
that
i
deserve
it
she
gone
from
us
god
blessing
be
with
her
she
might
have
stayed
and
i
lost
her
it
like
undine
is
it
george
she
was
in
this
room
once
said
george
he
saw
her
there
he
heard
the
sweet
low
voice
he
saw
the
sweet
smile
and
eyes
shining
so
kindly
the
face
remembered
so
fondly
thought
of
in
what
blest
and
loved
always
gone
now
a
glass
that
had
held
a
nosegay
a
bible
with
helen
handwriting
were
all
that
were
left
him
of
that
brief
flower
of
his
life
say
it
is
a
dream
say
it
passes
better
the
recollection
of
a
dream
than
an
aimless
waking
from
a
blank
stupor
the
two
friends
sate
in
silence
a
while
each
occupied
with
his
own
thoughts
and
aware
of
the
other
pen
broke
it
presently
by
saying
that
he
must
go
and
seek
for
his
uncle
and
report
progress
to
the
old
gentleman
the
major
had
written
in
a
very
bad
humour
the
major
was
getting
old
i
should
like
to
see
you
in
parliament
and
snugly
settled
with
a
comfortable
house
and
an
heir
to
the
name
before
i
make
my
bow
show
me
these
the
major
wrote
and
then
let
old
arthur
pendennis
make
room
for
the
younger
fellows
he
has
walked
the
pall
mall
pave
long
there
is
a
kindness
about
the
old
heathen
said
warrington
he
cares
for
somebody
besides
himself
at
least
for
some
other
part
of
himself
besides
that
which
is
buttoned
into
his
own
coat
for
you
and
your
race
he
would
like
to
see
the
progeny
of
the
pendennises
multiplying
and
increasing
and
hopes
that
they
may
inherit
the
land
the
old
patriarch
blesses
you
from
the
club
window
of
bays
and
is
carried
off
and
buried
under
the
flags
of
james
church
in
sight
of
piccadilly
and
the
cabstand
and
the
carriages
going
to
the
levee
it
is
an
edifying
the
new
blood
i
bring
into
the
family
mused
pen
is
rather
tainted
if
i
had
chosen
i
think
my
amory
would
not
have
been
the
progenitor
i
should
have
desired
for
my
race
nor
my
snell
nor
our
oriental
ancestors
by
the
way
who
was
amory
amory
was
lieutenant
of
an
indiaman
blanche
wrote
some
verses
about
him
about
the
storm
the
mountain
wave
the
seaman
grave
the
gallant
father
and
that
sort
of
thing
amory
was
drowned
commanding
a
country
ship
between
calcutta
and
sydney
amory
and
the
begum
were
happy
together
she
has
been
unlucky
in
her
selection
of
husbands
the
good
old
lady
for
between
ourselves
a
more
despicable
creature
than
sir
francis
clavering
of
clavering
park
baronet
never
never
legislated
for
his
country
broke
in
warrington
at
which
pen
blushed
rather
by
the
way
at
baden
said
warrington
i
found
our
friend
the
chevalier
strong
in
great
state
and
wearing
his
orders
he
told
me
that
he
had
quarrelled
with
clavering
of
whom
he
seemed
to
have
almost
as
bad
an
opinion
as
you
have
and
in
fact
i
think
though
i
will
not
be
certain
confided
to
me
his
opinion
that
clavering
was
an
utter
scoundrel
that
fellow
bloundell
who
taught
you
at
oxbridge
was
with
strong
and
time
i
think
has
brought
out
his
valuable
qualities
and
rendered
him
a
more
accomplished
rascal
than
he
was
during
your
undergraduateship
but
the
king
of
the
place
was
the
famous
colonel
altamont
who
was
carrying
all
before
him
giving
flies
to
the
whole
society
and
breaking
the
bank
it
was
my
uncle
knows
something
about
that
fellow
clavering
knows
something
about
him
there
something
louche
regarding
him
but
come
i
must
go
to
bury
street
like
a
dutiful
and
taking
his
hat
pen
prepared
to
go
i
will
walk
too
said
warrington
and
they
descended
the
stairs
stopping
however
at
pen
chambers
which
as
the
reader
has
been
informed
were
now
on
the
lower
story
here
pen
began
sprinkling
himself
with
and
carefully
scenting
his
hair
and
whiskers
with
that
odoriferous
water
what
is
the
matter
you
not
been
smoking
is
it
my
pipe
that
has
poisoned
you
growled
warrington
i
am
going
to
call
upon
some
women
said
pen
i
i
going
to
dine
with
they
are
passing
through
town
and
are
at
an
hotel
in
jermyn
warrington
looked
with
interest
at
the
young
fellow
dandifying
himself
up
to
a
pitch
of
completeness
and
appearing
at
length
in
a
gorgeous
and
neckcloth
fresh
gloves
and
glistening
boots
george
had
a
pair
of
thick
and
his
old
shirt
was
torn
about
the
breast
and
ragged
at
the
collar
where
his
blue
beard
had
worn
it
well
young
un
said
he
simply
i
like
you
to
be
a
buck
somehow
when
i
walk
about
with
you
it
is
as
if
i
had
a
rose
in
my
and
you
are
still
affable
i
do
think
there
is
any
young
fellow
in
the
temple
turns
out
like
you
and
i
do
believe
you
were
ever
ashamed
of
walking
with
me
do
laugh
at
me
said
pen
i
say
pen
continued
the
other
sadly
if
you
write
if
you
write
to
laura
i
wish
you
would
say
bless
her
from
pen
blushed
and
then
looked
at
warrington
and
then
and
then
burst
into
an
uncontrollable
fit
of
laughing
i
going
to
dine
with
her
he
said
i
brought
her
and
lady
rockminster
up
from
the
country
made
two
days
of
it
slept
last
night
at
bath
i
say
george
come
and
dine
too
i
may
ask
any
one
i
please
and
the
old
lady
is
constantly
talking
about
george
refused
george
had
an
article
to
write
george
hesitated
and
oh
strange
to
say
at
last
he
agreed
to
go
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
go
and
call
upon
the
ladies
and
they
marched
away
in
high
spirits
to
the
hotel
in
jermyn
street
once
more
the
dear
face
shone
upon
him
once
more
the
sweet
voice
spoke
to
him
and
the
tender
hand
pressed
a
welcome
there
still
wanted
half
an
hour
to
dinner
you
will
go
and
see
your
uncle
now
pendennis
old
lady
rockminster
said
you
will
not
bring
him
to
his
old
stories
are
intolerable
and
i
want
to
talk
to
warrington
i
daresay
he
will
amuse
us
i
think
we
have
heard
all
your
stories
we
have
been
together
for
two
whole
days
and
i
think
we
are
getting
tired
of
each
so
obeying
her
ladyship
orders
arthur
went
downstairs
and
walked
to
his
uncle
lodgings
chapter
lxxi
fiat
justitia
the
dinner
was
served
when
arthur
returned
and
lady
rockminster
began
to
scold
him
for
arriving
late
but
laura
looking
at
her
cousin
saw
that
his
face
was
so
pale
and
scared
that
she
interrupted
her
imperious
patroness
and
asked
with
tender
alarm
what
had
happened
was
arthur
ill
arthur
drank
a
large
bumper
of
sherry
i
have
heard
the
most
extraordinary
news
i
will
tell
you
afterwards
he
said
looking
at
the
servants
he
was
very
nervous
and
agitated
during
the
dinner
tramp
and
beat
so
with
your
feet
under
the
table
lady
rockminster
said
you
have
trodden
on
fido
and
upset
his
saucer
you
see
warrington
keeps
his
boots
at
the
dessert
it
seemed
as
if
the
unlucky
dinner
would
never
be
over
lady
rockminster
said
this
dinner
has
been
exceedingly
stupid
i
suppose
something
has
happened
and
that
you
want
to
speak
to
laura
i
will
go
and
have
my
nap
i
am
not
sure
that
i
shall
have
any
tea
no
good
night
warrington
you
must
come
again
and
when
there
is
no
business
to
talk
and
the
old
lady
tossing
up
her
head
walked
away
from
the
room
with
great
dignity
george
and
the
others
had
risen
with
her
and
warrington
was
about
to
go
away
and
was
saying
good
night
to
laura
who
of
course
was
looking
much
alarmed
about
her
cousin
when
arthur
said
pray
stay
george
you
should
hear
my
news
too
and
give
me
your
counsel
in
this
case
i
hardly
know
how
to
act
in
it
something
about
blanche
arthur
said
laura
her
heart
beating
and
her
cheek
blushing
as
she
thought
it
had
never
blushed
in
her
life
yes
and
the
most
extraordinary
story
said
pen
when
i
left
you
to
go
to
my
uncle
lodgings
i
found
his
servant
morgan
who
has
been
with
him
so
long
at
the
door
and
he
said
that
he
and
his
master
had
parted
that
morning
that
my
uncle
had
quitted
the
house
and
had
gone
to
an
hotel
this
hotel
i
asked
for
him
when
i
came
in
but
he
was
gone
out
to
dinner
morgan
then
said
that
he
had
something
of
a
most
important
nature
to
communicate
to
me
and
begged
me
to
step
into
the
house
his
house
it
is
now
it
appears
the
scoundrel
has
saved
a
great
deal
of
money
whilst
in
my
uncle
service
and
is
now
a
capitalist
and
a
millionaire
for
what
i
know
well
i
went
into
the
house
and
what
do
you
think
he
told
me
this
must
be
a
secret
between
us
all
at
least
if
we
can
keep
it
now
that
it
is
in
possession
of
that
villain
father
is
not
dead
he
has
come
to
life
again
the
marriage
between
clavering
and
the
begum
is
no
and
blanche
i
suppose
is
her
grandfather
heir
said
warrington
perhaps
but
the
child
of
what
a
father
amory
is
an
escaped
convict
clavering
knows
it
my
uncle
knows
it
and
it
was
with
this
piece
of
information
held
over
clavering
in
terrorem
that
the
wretched
old
man
got
him
to
give
up
his
borough
to
blanche
does
know
it
said
laura
nor
poor
lady
clavering
no
said
pen
blanche
does
not
even
know
the
history
of
her
father
she
knew
that
he
and
her
mother
had
separated
and
had
heard
as
a
child
from
bonner
her
nurse
that
amory
was
drowned
in
new
south
wales
he
was
there
as
a
convict
not
as
a
as
the
poor
girl
thought
lady
clavering
has
told
me
that
they
were
not
happy
and
that
her
husband
was
a
bad
character
she
would
tell
me
all
she
said
some
day
and
i
remember
her
saying
to
me
with
tears
in
her
eyes
that
it
was
hard
for
a
woman
to
be
forced
to
own
that
she
was
glad
to
hear
her
husband
was
dead
and
that
twice
in
her
life
she
should
have
chosen
so
badly
what
is
to
be
done
now
the
man
ca
show
and
claim
his
wife
death
is
probably
over
him
if
he
discovers
himself
return
to
transportation
certainly
but
the
rascal
has
held
the
threat
of
discovery
over
clavering
for
some
time
past
and
has
extorted
money
from
him
time
after
it
is
our
friend
colonel
altamont
of
course
said
warrington
i
see
all
if
the
rascal
comes
back
continued
arthur
morgan
who
knows
his
secret
will
use
it
over
him
and
having
it
in
his
possession
proposes
to
extort
money
from
us
all
the
d
d
rascal
supposed
i
was
cognisant
of
it
said
pen
white
with
anger
asked
me
if
i
would
give
him
an
annuity
to
keep
it
quiet
threatened
me
me
as
if
i
was
trafficking
with
this
wretched
old
begum
misfortune
and
would
extort
a
seat
in
parliament
out
of
that
miserable
clavering
good
heavens
was
my
uncle
mad
to
tamper
in
such
a
conspiracy
fancy
our
mother
son
laura
trading
on
such
a
treason
i
ca
fancy
it
dear
arthur
said
laura
seizing
arthur
hand
and
kissing
it
no
broke
out
warrington
deep
voice
with
a
tremor
he
surveyed
the
two
generous
and
loving
young
people
with
a
pang
of
indescribable
love
and
pain
no
our
boy
ca
meddle
with
such
a
wretched
intrigue
as
that
arthur
pendennis
ca
marry
a
convict
daughter
and
sit
in
parliament
as
member
for
the
hulks
you
must
wash
your
hands
of
the
whole
affair
pen
you
must
break
off
you
must
give
no
explanations
of
why
and
wherefore
but
state
that
family
reasons
render
a
match
impossible
it
is
better
that
those
poor
women
should
fancy
you
false
to
your
word
than
that
they
should
know
the
truth
besides
you
can
get
from
that
dog
clavering
i
can
fetch
that
for
you
easily
enough
an
acknowledgment
that
the
reasons
which
you
have
given
to
him
as
the
head
of
the
family
are
amply
sufficient
for
breaking
off
the
union
do
you
think
with
me
laura
he
scarcely
dared
to
look
her
in
the
face
as
he
spoke
any
lingering
hope
that
he
might
have
any
feeble
hold
that
he
might
feel
upon
the
last
spar
of
his
wrecked
fortune
he
knew
he
was
casting
away
and
he
let
the
wave
of
his
calamity
close
over
him
pen
had
started
up
whilst
he
was
speaking
looking
eagerly
at
him
he
turned
his
head
away
he
saw
laura
rise
up
also
and
go
to
pen
and
once
more
take
his
hand
and
kiss
it
she
thinks
so
too
god
bless
her
said
george
her
father
shame
is
not
blanche
fault
dear
arthur
is
it
laura
said
very
pale
and
speaking
very
quickly
suppose
you
had
been
married
would
you
desert
her
because
she
had
done
no
wrong
are
you
not
pledged
to
her
would
you
leave
her
because
she
is
in
misfortune
and
if
she
is
unhappy
would
you
console
her
our
mother
would
had
she
been
and
as
she
spoke
the
kind
girl
folded
her
arms
round
him
and
buried
her
face
upon
his
heart
our
mother
is
an
angel
with
god
pen
sobbed
out
and
you
are
the
dearest
and
best
of
women
the
dearest
the
dearest
and
the
best
teach
me
my
duty
pray
for
me
that
i
may
do
it
pure
heart
god
bless
you
god
bless
you
my
sister
amen
groaned
out
warrington
with
his
head
in
his
hands
she
is
right
he
murmured
to
himself
she
ca
do
any
wrong
i
think
that
indeed
she
looked
and
smiled
like
an
angel
many
a
day
after
he
saw
that
smile
saw
her
radiant
face
as
she
looked
up
at
pen
saw
her
putting
back
her
curls
blushing
and
smiling
and
still
looking
fondly
towards
him
she
leaned
for
a
moment
her
little
fair
hand
on
the
table
playing
on
it
and
now
and
now
she
said
looking
at
the
two
gentlemen
and
what
now
asked
george
and
now
we
will
have
some
tea
said
miss
laura
with
her
smile
but
before
this
unromantic
conclusion
to
a
rather
sentimental
scene
could
be
suffered
to
take
place
a
servant
brought
word
that
major
pendennis
had
returned
to
the
hotel
and
was
waiting
to
see
his
nephew
upon
this
announcement
laura
not
without
some
alarm
and
an
appealing
look
to
pen
which
said
behave
yourself
well
hold
to
the
right
and
do
your
duty
be
gentle
but
firm
with
your
uncle
laura
we
say
with
these
warnings
written
in
her
face
took
leave
of
the
two
gentlemen
and
retreated
to
her
dormitory
warrington
who
was
not
generally
fond
of
tea
yet
grudged
that
expected
cup
very
much
why
could
not
old
pendennis
have
come
in
an
hour
later
well
an
hour
sooner
or
later
what
matter
the
hour
strikes
at
last
the
inevitable
moment
comes
to
say
farewell
the
hand
is
shaken
the
door
closed
and
the
friend
gone
and
the
brief
joy
over
you
are
alone
in
which
of
those
many
windows
of
the
hotel
does
her
light
beam
perhaps
he
asks
himself
as
he
passes
down
the
street
he
strides
away
to
the
of
a
neighbouring
club
and
there
applies
himself
to
his
usual
solace
of
a
cigar
men
are
brawling
and
talking
loud
about
politics
the
atrocious
tyranny
of
the
committee
bearing
this
sacred
secret
about
him
he
enters
into
this
brawl
talk
away
each
louder
than
the
other
rattle
and
crack
jokes
laugh
and
tell
your
wild
stories
it
is
strange
to
take
one
place
and
part
in
the
midst
of
the
smoke
and
din
and
think
every
man
here
has
his
secret
ego
most
likely
which
is
sitting
lonely
and
apart
away
in
the
private
chamber
from
the
loud
game
in
which
the
rest
of
us
is
joining
arthur
as
he
traversed
the
passages
of
the
hotel
felt
his
anger
rousing
up
within
him
he
was
indignant
to
think
that
yonder
old
gentleman
whom
he
was
about
to
meet
should
have
made
him
such
a
tool
and
puppet
and
so
compromised
his
honour
and
good
name
the
old
fellow
hand
was
very
cold
and
shaky
when
arthur
took
it
he
was
coughing
he
was
grumbling
over
the
fire
frosch
could
not
bring
his
or
arrange
his
papers
as
that
d
d
confounded
impudent
scoundrel
of
a
morgan
the
old
gentleman
bemoaned
himself
and
cursed
morgan
ingratitude
with
peevish
pathos
the
confounded
impudent
scoundrel
he
was
drunk
last
night
and
challenged
me
to
fight
him
pen
and
begad
at
one
time
i
was
so
excited
that
i
thought
i
should
have
driven
a
knife
into
him
and
the
infernal
rascal
has
made
ten
thousand
pound
i
believe
and
deserves
to
be
hanged
and
will
be
but
curse
him
i
wish
he
could
have
lasted
out
my
time
he
knew
all
my
ways
and
dammy
when
i
rang
the
bell
the
confounded
thief
brought
the
thing
i
wanted
not
like
that
stupid
german
lout
and
what
sort
of
time
have
you
had
in
the
country
been
a
good
deal
with
lady
rockminster
you
ca
do
better
she
is
one
of
the
old
school
vieille
ecole
bonne
ecole
hey
dammy
they
do
make
gentlemen
and
ladies
now
and
in
fifty
years
you
hardly
know
one
man
from
another
but
they
last
my
time
i
ai
long
for
this
business
i
am
getting
very
old
pen
my
boy
and
gad
i
was
thinking
as
i
was
packing
up
my
little
library
there
a
bible
amongst
the
books
that
belonged
to
my
poor
mother
i
would
like
you
to
keep
that
pen
i
was
thinking
sir
that
you
would
most
likely
open
the
box
when
it
was
your
property
and
the
old
fellow
was
laid
under
the
sod
sir
and
the
major
coughed
and
wagged
his
old
head
over
the
fire
his
age
his
kindness
disarmed
pen
anger
somewhat
and
made
arthur
feel
no
little
compunction
for
the
deed
which
he
was
about
to
do
he
knew
that
the
announcement
which
he
was
about
to
make
would
destroy
the
darling
hope
of
the
old
gentleman
life
and
create
in
his
breast
a
woeful
anger
and
commotion
hey
hey
i
off
sir
nodded
the
elder
but
i
like
to
read
a
speech
of
yours
in
the
times
before
i
go
pendennis
said
unaccustomed
as
i
am
to
public
speaking
hey
sir
hey
arthur
begad
you
look
well
and
healthy
sir
i
always
said
my
brother
jack
would
bring
the
family
right
you
must
go
down
into
the
west
and
buy
the
old
estate
sir
nec
tenui
penna
hey
we
rise
again
sir
rise
again
on
the
wing
and
begad
i
should
be
surprised
that
you
will
be
a
baronet
before
you
his
words
smote
pen
and
it
is
i
he
thought
that
am
going
to
fling
down
the
poor
old
fellow
well
it
must
be
here
i
i
went
into
your
lodgings
at
bury
street
though
i
did
not
find
you
pen
slowly
began
and
i
talked
with
morgan
indeed
the
old
gentleman
cheek
began
to
flush
involuntarily
and
he
muttered
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
now
begad
he
told
me
a
story
sir
which
gave
me
the
deepest
surprise
and
pain
said
pen
the
major
tried
to
look
unconcerned
what
that
story
about
about
hey
about
miss
amory
father
about
lady
clavering
first
husband
and
who
he
is
and
hem
a
awkward
affair
said
the
old
man
rubbing
his
nose
i
i
been
aware
of
that
eh
confounded
circumstance
for
some
i
wish
i
had
known
it
sooner
or
not
at
all
said
arthur
gloomily
he
is
all
safe
thought
the
senior
greatly
relieved
gad
i
should
have
liked
to
keep
it
from
you
altogether
and
from
those
two
poor
women
who
are
as
innocent
as
unborn
babes
in
the
you
are
right
there
is
no
reason
why
the
two
women
should
hear
it
and
i
shall
never
tell
them
though
that
villain
morgan
perhaps
may
arthur
said
gloomily
he
seems
disposed
to
trade
upon
his
secret
and
has
already
proposed
terms
of
ransom
to
me
i
wish
i
had
known
of
the
matter
earlier
sir
it
is
not
a
very
pleasant
thought
to
me
that
i
am
engaged
to
a
convict
the
very
reason
why
i
kept
it
from
you
my
dear
boy
but
miss
amory
is
not
a
convict
daughter
do
you
see
miss
amory
is
the
daughter
of
lady
clavering
with
fifty
or
sixty
thousand
pounds
for
a
fortune
and
her
a
baronet
and
country
gentleman
of
high
reputation
approves
of
the
match
and
gives
up
his
seat
in
parliament
to
his
what
can
be
more
simple
is
it
true
sir
begad
yes
it
is
true
of
course
it
true
amory
dead
i
tell
you
he
is
dead
the
first
sign
of
life
he
shows
he
is
dead
he
appear
we
have
him
at
a
deadlock
like
the
fellow
in
the
play
the
hey
amusing
play
that
monstrous
witty
man
sheridan
and
so
was
his
son
by
gad
sir
when
i
was
at
the
cape
i
remember
the
old
gentleman
garrulity
and
wish
to
conduct
arthur
to
the
cape
perhaps
arose
from
a
desire
to
avoid
the
subject
which
was
nearest
his
nephew
heart
but
arthur
broke
out
interrupting
him
if
you
had
told
me
this
tale
sooner
i
believe
you
would
have
spared
me
and
yourself
a
great
deal
of
pain
and
disappointment
and
i
should
not
have
found
myself
tied
to
an
engagement
from
which
i
ca
in
honour
no
begad
we
fixed
you
and
a
man
who
fixed
to
a
seat
in
parliament
and
a
pretty
girl
with
a
couple
of
thousand
a
year
is
fixed
to
no
bad
thing
let
me
tell
you
said
the
old
man
great
heavens
sir
said
arthur
are
you
blind
ca
you
see
see
what
young
gentleman
asked
the
other
see
that
rather
than
trade
upon
this
secret
of
amory
arthur
cried
out
i
would
go
and
join
my
at
the
hulks
see
that
rather
than
take
a
seat
in
parliament
as
a
bribe
from
clavering
for
silence
i
would
take
the
spoons
off
the
table
see
that
you
have
given
me
a
felon
daughter
for
a
wife
doomed
me
to
poverty
and
shame
cursed
my
career
when
it
might
have
been
when
it
might
have
been
so
different
but
for
you
do
you
see
that
we
have
been
playing
a
guilty
game
and
have
been
overreached
that
in
offering
to
marry
this
poor
girl
for
the
sake
of
her
money
and
the
advancement
she
would
bring
i
was
degrading
myself
and
prostituting
my
honour
what
in
heaven
name
do
you
mean
sir
cried
the
old
man
i
mean
to
say
that
there
is
a
measure
of
baseness
which
i
ca
pass
arthur
said
i
have
no
other
words
for
it
and
am
sorry
if
they
hurt
you
i
have
felt
for
months
past
that
my
conduct
in
this
affair
has
been
wicked
sordid
and
worldly
i
am
rightly
punished
by
the
event
and
having
sold
myself
for
money
and
a
seat
in
parliament
by
losing
how
do
you
mean
that
you
lose
either
shrieked
the
old
gentleman
who
the
devil
to
take
your
fortune
or
your
seat
away
from
you
by
g
clavering
shall
give
to
you
you
shall
have
every
shilling
of
eighty
thousand
i
keep
my
promise
to
miss
amory
sir
said
arthur
and
begad
her
parents
shall
keep
theirs
to
not
so
please
god
arthur
answered
i
have
sinned
but
heaven
help
me
i
will
sin
no
more
i
will
let
clavering
off
from
that
bargain
which
was
made
without
my
knowledge
i
will
take
no
money
with
blanche
but
that
which
was
originally
settled
upon
her
and
i
will
try
to
make
her
happy
you
have
done
it
you
have
brought
this
on
me
sir
but
you
knew
no
better
and
i
forgive
arthur
in
god
name
in
your
father
who
by
heavens
was
the
proudest
man
alive
and
had
the
honour
of
the
family
always
at
heart
in
mine
for
the
sake
of
a
poor
old
fellow
who
has
always
been
fond
of
you
do
fling
this
chance
away
i
pray
you
i
beg
you
i
implore
you
my
dear
dear
boy
do
fling
this
chance
away
it
the
making
of
you
you
sure
to
get
on
you
be
a
baronet
three
thousand
a
year
dammy
on
my
knees
there
i
beg
of
you
do
do
and
the
old
man
actually
sank
down
on
his
knees
and
seizing
one
of
arthur
hands
looked
up
piteously
at
him
it
was
cruel
to
remark
the
shaking
hands
the
wrinkled
and
quivering
face
the
old
eyes
weeping
and
winking
the
broken
voice
ah
sir
said
arthur
with
a
groan
you
have
brought
pain
enough
on
me
spare
me
this
you
have
wished
me
to
marry
blanche
i
marry
her
for
god
sake
sir
rise
i
ca
bear
you
you
mean
to
say
that
you
will
take
her
as
a
beggar
and
be
one
yourself
said
the
old
gentleman
rising
up
and
coughing
violently
i
look
at
her
as
a
person
to
whom
a
great
calamity
has
befallen
and
to
whom
i
am
promised
she
can
not
help
the
misfortune
and
as
she
had
my
word
when
she
was
prosperous
i
shall
not
withdraw
it
now
she
is
poor
i
will
not
take
clavering
seat
unless
afterwards
it
should
be
given
of
his
free
will
i
will
not
have
a
shilling
more
than
her
original
have
the
kindness
to
ring
the
bell
said
the
old
gentleman
i
have
done
my

old
fellow

on
my
knees
by
jove
to
my
own
nephew
i
might
have
been
good
night
sir
you
need
trouble
yourself
to
call
arthur
took
his
hand
which
the
old
man
left
to
him
it
was
quite
passive
and
clammy
he
looked
very
much
oldened
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
contest
and
defeat
had
quite
broken
him
on
the
next
day
he
kept
his
bed
and
refused
to
see
his
nephew
chapter
lxxii
in
which
the
decks
begin
to
clear
when
arrayed
in
his
pen
walked
up
according
to
custom
to
warrington
chambers
next
morning
to
inform
his
friend
of
the
issue
of
the
last
night
interview
with
his
uncle
and
to
ask
as
usual
for
george
advice
and
opinion
flanagan
the
laundress
was
the
only
person
whom
arthur
found
in
the
dear
old
chambers
george
had
taken
a
and
was
gone
his
address
was
to
his
brother
house
in
suffolk
packages
addressed
to
the
newspaper
and
review
for
which
he
wrote
lay
on
the
table
awaiting
delivery
i
found
him
at
the
table
when
i
came
the
dear
gentleman
flanagan
said
writing
at
his
papers
and
one
of
the
candles
was
burned
out
and
hard
as
his
bed
is
he
was
in
it
all
night
indeed
having
sat
at
the
club
until
the
brawl
there
became
intolerable
to
him
george
had
walked
home
and
had
passed
the
night
finishing
some
work
on
which
he
was
employed
and
to
the
completion
of
which
he
bent
himself
with
all
his
might
the
labour
was
done
and
the
night
was
worn
away
somehow
and
the
tardy
november
dawn
came
and
looked
in
on
the
young
man
as
he
sate
over
his
desk
in
the
next
day
paper
or
quarter
review
many
of
us
very
likely
admired
the
work
of
his
genius
the
variety
of
his
illustration
the
fierce
vigour
of
his
satire
the
depth
of
his
reason
there
was
no
hint
in
his
writing
of
the
other
thoughts
which
occupied
him
and
always
accompanied
him
in
his
work
a
tone
more
melancholy
than
was
customary
a
satire
more
bitter
and
impatient
than
that
which
he
afterwards
showed
may
have
marked
the
writings
of
this
period
of
his
life
to
the
very
few
persons
who
knew
his
style
or
his
name
we
have
said
before
could
we
know
the
man
feelings
as
well
as
the
author
thoughts
how
interesting
most
books
would
be
more
interesting
than
merry
i
suppose
harlequin
face
behind
his
mask
is
always
grave
if
not
melancholy
certainly
each
man
who
lives
by
the
pen
and
happens
to
read
this
must
remember
if
he
will
his
own
experiences
and
recall
many
solemn
hours
of
solitude
and
labour
what
a
constant
care
sate
at
the
side
of
the
desk
and
accompanied
him
fever
or
sickness
were
lying
possibly
in
the
next
room
a
sick
child
might
be
there
with
a
wife
watching
over
it
terrified
and
in
prayer
or
grief
might
be
bearing
him
down
and
the
cruel
mist
before
the
eyes
rendering
the
paper
scarce
visible
as
he
wrote
on
it
and
the
inexorable
necessity
drove
on
the
pen
what
man
among
us
has
not
had
nights
and
hours
like
these
but
to
the
manly
heart
severe
as
these
pangs
are
they
are
endurable
long
as
the
night
seems
the
dawn
comes
at
last
and
the
wounds
heal
and
the
fever
abates
and
rest
comes
and
you
can
afford
to
look
back
on
the
past
misery
with
feelings
that
are
anything
but
bitter
two
or
three
books
for
reference
fragments
of
manuscript
drawers
open
pens
and
inkstand
lines
half
visible
on
the
a
bit
of
twisted
and
bitten
and
broken
into
sundry
pieces
such
relics
as
these
were
about
the
table
and
pen
flung
himself
down
in
george
empty
chair
noting
things
according
to
his
wont
or
in
spite
of
himself
there
was
a
gap
in
the
bookcase
next
to
the
old
college
plato
with
the
boniface
arms
where
helen
bible
used
to
be
he
has
taken
that
with
him
thought
pen
he
knew
why
his
friend
was
gone
dear
dear
old
george
pen
rubbed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
oh
how
much
wiser
how
much
better
how
much
nobler
he
is
than
i
he
thought
where
was
such
a
friend
or
such
a
brave
heart
where
shall
i
ever
hear
such
a
frank
voice
and
kind
laughter
where
shall
i
ever
see
such
a
true
gentleman
no
wonder
she
loved
him
god
bless
him
what
was
i
compared
to
him
what
could
she
do
else
but
love
him
to
the
end
of
our
days
we
will
be
her
brothers
as
fate
wills
that
we
can
be
no
more
we
be
her
knights
and
wait
on
her
and
when
we
old
we
say
how
we
loved
her
dear
dear
old
george
when
pen
descended
to
his
own
chambers
his
eye
fell
on
the
of
his
outer
door
which
he
had
previously
overlooked
and
there
was
a
little
note
to
in
george
handwriting
george
had
put
into
pen
box
probably
as
he
was
going
away
dear
pen
i
shall
be
home
when
you
breakfast
and
intend
to
stay
over
christmas
in
norfolk
or
elsewhere
i
have
my
own
opinion
of
the
issue
of
matters
about
which
we
talked
in
j
yesterday
and
think
my
presence
de
trop
vale
give
my
very
best
regards
and
adieux
to
your
and
so
george
was
gone
and
flanagan
the
laundress
ruled
over
his
empty
chambers
pen
of
course
had
to
go
and
see
his
uncle
on
the
day
after
their
colloquy
and
not
being
admitted
he
naturally
went
to
lady
rockminster
apartments
where
the
old
lady
instantly
asked
for
bluebeard
and
insisted
that
he
should
come
to
dinner
bluebeard
is
gone
pen
said
and
he
took
out
poor
george
scrap
of
paper
and
handed
it
to
laura
who
looked
at
it
did
not
look
at
pen
in
return
but
passed
the
paper
back
to
him
and
walked
away
pen
rushed
into
an
eloquent
eulogium
upon
his
dear
old
george
to
lady
rockminster
who
was
astonished
at
his
enthusiasm
she
had
never
heard
him
so
warm
in
praise
of
anybody
and
told
him
with
her
usual
frankness
that
she
did
think
it
had
been
in
his
nature
to
care
so
much
about
any
other
person
as
pendennis
was
passing
in
waterloo
place
in
one
of
his
many
walks
to
the
hotel
where
laura
lived
and
whither
duty
to
his
uncle
carried
arthur
every
day
arthur
saw
issuing
from
gimcrack
celebrated
shop
an
old
friend
who
was
followed
to
his
brougham
by
an
obsequious
shopman
bearing
parcels
the
gentleman
was
in
the
deepest
mourning
the
brougham
the
driver
and
the
horse
were
in
mourning
grief
in
easy
circumstances
and
supported
by
the
comfortablest
springs
and
cushions
was
typified
in
the
equipage
and
the
little
gentleman
its
proprietor
what
foker
hail
foker
cried
out
pen
the
reader
no
doubt
has
likewise
recognised
arthur
old
schoolfellow
and
he
held
out
his
hand
to
the
heir
of
the
late
lamented
john
henry
foker
the
master
of
logwood
and
other
houses
the
principal
partner
in
the
great
brewery
of
foker
and
the
greater
portion
of
foker
entire
a
little
hand
covered
with
a
glove
of
the
deepest
ebony
and
set
off
by
three
inches
of
a
snowy
wristband
was
put
forth
to
meet
salutation
the
other
little
hand
held
a
little
morocco
case
containing
no
doubt
something
precious
of
which
foker
had
just
become
proprietor
in
gimcrack
shop
pen
keen
eyes
and
satiric
turn
showed
him
at
once
upon
what
errand
foker
had
been
employed
and
he
thought
of
the
heir
in
horace
pouring
forth
the
gathered
wine
of
his
father
vats
and
that
human
nature
is
pretty
much
the
same
in
regent
street
as
in
the
via
sacra
le
roi
est
mort
vive
le
roi
said
arthur
ah
said
the
other
yes
thank
you
very
much
obliged
how
do
you
do
pen
very
busy
and
he
jumped
into
the
black
brougham
and
sate
like
a
little
black
care
behind
the
black
coachman
he
had
blushed
on
seeing
pen
and
shown
other
signs
of
guilt
and
perturbation
which
pen
attributed
to
the
novelty
of
his
situation
and
on
which
he
began
to
speculate
in
his
usual
sardonic
manner
yes
so
wags
the
world
thought
pen
the
stone
closes
over
harry
the
fourth
and
harry
the
fifth
reigns
in
his
stead
the
old
ministers
at
the
brewery
come
and
kneel
before
him
with
their
books
the
draymen
his
subjects
fling
up
their
red
caps
and
shout
for
him
what
a
grave
deference
and
sympathy
the
bankers
and
the
lawyers
show
there
was
too
great
a
stake
at
issue
between
those
two
that
they
should
ever
love
each
other
very
cordially
as
long
as
one
man
keeps
another
out
of
twenty
thousand
a
year
the
younger
must
be
always
hankering
after
the
crown
and
the
wish
must
be
the
father
to
the
thought
of
possession
thank
heaven
there
was
no
thought
of
money
between
me
and
our
dear
mother
there
never
could
have
been
you
would
have
spurned
it
cried
laura
why
make
yourself
more
selfish
than
you
are
pen
and
allow
your
mind
to
own
for
an
instant
that
it
would
have
entertained
such
such
dreadful
meanness
you
make
me
blush
for
you
arthur
you
make
me
her
eyes
finished
this
sentence
and
she
passed
her
handkerchief
across
them
there
are
some
truths
which
women
will
never
acknowledge
pen
said
and
from
which
your
modesty
always
turns
away
i
do
not
say
that
i
ever
knew
the
feeling
only
that
i
am
glad
i
had
not
the
temptation
is
there
any
harm
in
that
confession
of
weakness
we
are
all
taught
to
ask
to
be
delivered
from
evil
arthur
said
laura
in
a
low
voice
i
am
glad
if
you
were
spared
from
that
great
crime
and
only
sorry
to
think
that
you
could
by
any
possibility
have
been
led
into
it
but
you
never
could
and
you
do
think
you
could
your
acts
are
generous
and
kind
you
disdain
mean
actions
you
take
blanche
without
money
and
without
a
bribe
yes
thanks
be
to
heaven
dear
brother
you
could
not
have
sold
yourself
away
i
knew
you
could
not
when
it
came
to
the
day
and
you
did
not
praise
be
be
where
praise
is
due
why
does
this
horrid
scepticism
pursue
you
my
arthur
why
doubt
and
sneer
at
your
own
heart
at
every
one
oh
if
you
knew
the
pain
you
give
me
how
i
lie
awake
and
think
of
those
hard
sentences
dear
brother
and
wish
them
unspoken
unthought
do
i
cause
you
many
thoughts
and
many
tears
laura
asked
arthur
the
fulness
of
innocent
love
beamed
from
her
in
reply
a
smile
heavenly
pure
a
glance
of
unutterable
tenderness
sympathy
pity
shone
in
her
face
all
which
indications
of
love
and
purity
arthur
beheld
and
worshipped
in
her
as
you
would
watch
them
in
a
child
as
one
fancies
one
might
regard
them
in
an
angel
i
i
do
know
what
i
have
done
he
said
simply
to
have
merited
such
regard
from
two
such
women
it
is
like
undeserved
praise
laura
or
too
much
good
fortune
which
frightens
one
or
a
great
post
when
a
man
feels
that
he
is
not
fit
for
it
ah
sister
how
weak
and
wicked
we
are
how
spotless
and
full
of
love
and
truth
heaven
made
you
i
think
for
some
of
you
there
has
been
no
fall
he
said
looking
at
the
charming
girl
with
an
almost
paternal
glance
of
admiration
you
ca
help
having
sweet
thoughts
and
doing
good
actions
dear
creature
they
are
the
flowers
which
you
and
what
else
sir
asked
laura
i
see
a
sneer
coming
over
your
face
what
is
it
why
does
it
come
to
drive
all
the
good
thoughts
away
a
sneer
is
there
i
was
thinking
my
dear
that
nature
in
making
you
so
good
and
loving
did
very
well
but
but
what
what
is
that
wicked
but
and
why
are
you
always
calling
it
up
but
will
come
in
spite
of
us
but
is
reflection
but
is
the
familiar
with
whom
he
has
made
a
compact
and
if
he
forgets
it
and
indulges
in
happy
or
building
of
or
listens
to
sweet
music
let
us
say
or
to
the
bells
ringing
to
church
but
taps
at
the
door
and
says
master
i
am
here
you
are
my
master
but
i
am
yours
go
where
you
will
you
ca
travel
without
me
i
will
whisper
to
you
when
you
are
on
your
knees
at
church
i
will
be
at
your
marriage
pillow
i
will
sit
down
at
your
table
with
your
children
i
will
be
behind
your
deathbed
curtain
that
is
what
but
is
pen
said
pen
you
frighten
me
cried
laura
do
you
know
what
but
came
and
said
to
me
just
now
when
i
was
looking
at
you
but
said
if
that
girl
had
reason
as
well
as
love
she
would
love
you
no
more
if
she
knew
you
as
you
are
the
sullied
selfish
being
which
you
know
she
must
part
from
you
and
could
give
you
no
love
and
no
sympathy
did
i
say
he
added
fondly
that
some
of
you
seem
exempt
from
the
fall
love
you
know
but
the
knowledge
of
evil
is
kept
from
what
is
this
you
young
folks
are
talking
about
asked
lady
rockminster
who
at
this
moment
made
her
appearance
in
the
room
having
performed
in
the
mystic
retirement
of
her
own
apartments
and
under
the
hands
of
her
attendant
those
elaborate
without
which
the
worthy
old
lady
never
presented
herself
to
public
view
mr
pendennis
you
are
always
coming
it
is
very
pleasant
to
be
here
arthur
said
and
we
were
talking
when
you
came
in
about
my
friend
foker
whom
i
met
just
now
and
who
as
your
ladyship
knows
has
succeeded
to
his
father
he
has
a
very
fine
property
he
has
fifteen
thousand
a
year
he
is
my
cousin
he
is
a
very
worthy
young
man
he
must
come
and
see
me
said
lady
rockminster
with
a
look
at
laura
he
has
been
engaged
for
many
years
past
to
his
cousin
lady
lady
ann
is
a
foolish
little
chit
lady
rockminster
said
with
much
dignity
and
i
have
no
patience
with
her
she
has
outraged
every
feeling
of
society
she
has
broken
her
father
heart
and
thrown
away
fifteen
thousand
a
thrown
away
what
has
happened
asked
pen
it
will
be
the
talk
of
the
town
in
a
day
or
two
and
there
is
no
need
why
i
should
keep
the
secret
any
longer
said
lady
rockminster
who
had
written
and
received
a
dozen
letters
on
the
subject
i
had
a
letter
yesterday
from
my
daughter
who
was
staying
at
drummington
until
all
the
world
was
obliged
to
go
away
on
account
of
the
frightful
catastrophe
which
happened
there
when
foker
came
home
from
nice
and
after
the
funeral
lady
ann
went
down
on
her
knees
to
her
father
said
that
she
never
could
marry
her
cousin
that
she
had
contracted
another
attachment
and
that
she
must
die
rather
than
fulfil
her
contract
poor
lord
rosherville
who
is
dreadfully
embarrassed
showed
his
daughter
what
the
state
of
his
affairs
was
and
that
it
was
necessary
that
the
arrangements
should
take
place
and
in
fine
we
all
supposed
that
she
had
listened
to
reason
and
intended
to
comply
with
the
desires
of
her
family
but
what
has
happened
last
thursday
she
went
out
after
breakfast
with
her
maid
and
was
married
in
the
very
church
in
drummington
park
to
hobson
her
father
own
chaplain
and
her
brother
tutor
a
widower
with
two
children
poor
dear
rosherville
is
in
a
dreadful
way
he
wishes
henry
foker
should
marry
alice
or
barbara
but
alice
is
marked
with
the
and
barbara
is
ten
years
older
than
he
is
and
of
course
now
the
young
man
is
his
own
master
he
will
think
of
choosing
for
himself
the
blow
on
lady
agnes
is
very
cruel
she
is
inconsolable
she
has
the
house
in
grosvenor
street
for
her
life
and
her
settlement
which
was
very
handsome
have
you
not
met
her
yes
she
dined
one
day
at
lady
clavering
the
first
day
i
saw
you
and
a
very
disagreeable
young
man
i
thought
you
were
but
i
have
formed
you
we
have
formed
him
have
we
laura
where
is
bluebeard
let
him
come
that
horrid
grindley
the
dentist
will
keep
me
in
town
another
to
the
latter
part
of
her
ladyship
speech
arthur
gave
no
ear
he
was
thinking
for
whom
could
foker
be
purchasing
those
trinkets
which
he
was
carrying
away
from
the
jeweller
why
did
harry
seem
anxious
to
avoid
him
could
he
be
still
faithful
to
the
attachment
which
had
agitated
him
so
much
and
sent
him
abroad
eighteen
months
back
psha
the
bracelets
and
presents
were
for
some
of
harry
old
friends
of
the
opera
or
the
french
theatre
rumours
from
naples
and
paris
rumours
such
as
are
borne
to
club
had
announced
that
the
young
man
had
found
distractions
or
precluded
from
his
virtuous
attachment
the
poor
fellow
had
flung
himself
back
upon
his
old
companions
and
amusements
not
the
only
man
or
woman
whom
society
forces
into
evil
or
debars
from
good
not
the
only
victim
of
the
world
selfish
and
wicked
laws
as
a
good
thing
when
it
is
to
be
done
can
not
be
done
too
quickly
laura
was
anxious
that
pen
marriage
intentions
should
be
put
into
execution
as
speedily
as
possible
and
pressed
on
his
arrangements
with
rather
a
feverish
anxiety
why
could
she
not
wait
pen
could
afford
to
do
so
with
perfect
equanimity
but
laura
would
hear
of
no
delay
she
wrote
to
pen
she
implored
pen
she
used
every
means
to
urge
expedition
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
have
no
rest
until
arthur
happiness
was
complete
she
offered
herself
to
dearest
blanche
to
come
and
stay
at
tunbridge
with
her
when
lady
rockminster
should
go
on
her
intended
visit
to
the
reigning
house
of
rockminster
and
although
the
old
dowager
scolded
and
ordered
and
commanded
laura
was
deaf
and
disobedient
she
must
go
to
tunbridge
she
would
go
to
tunbridge
she
who
ordinarily
had
no
will
of
her
own
and
complied
smilingly
with
anybody
whim
and
caprices
showed
the
most
selfish
and
obstinate
determination
in
this
instance
the
dowager
lady
must
nurse
herself
in
her
rheumatism
she
must
read
herself
to
sleep
if
she
would
not
hear
her
maid
whose
voice
croaked
and
who
made
sad
work
of
the
sentimental
passages
in
the
novels
laura
must
go
and
be
with
her
new
sister
in
another
week
she
proposed
with
many
loves
and
regards
to
dear
lady
clavering
to
pass
some
time
with
dearest
blanche
dearest
blanche
wrote
instantly
in
reply
to
dearest
laura
no
to
say
with
what
extreme
delight
she
should
welcome
her
sister
how
charming
it
would
be
to
practise
their
old
duets
together
to
wander
the
grassy
sward
and
amidst
the
yellowing
woods
of
penshurst
and
southborough
blanche
counted
the
hours
till
she
should
embrace
her
dearest
friend
laura
no
expressed
her
delight
at
dearest
blanche
affectionate
reply
she
hoped
that
their
friendship
would
never
diminish
that
the
confidence
between
them
would
grow
in
after
years
that
they
should
have
no
secrets
from
each
other
that
the
aim
of
the
life
of
each
would
be
to
make
one
person
happy
blanche
no
followed
in
two
days
how
provoking
their
house
was
very
small
the
two
spare
bedrooms
were
occupied
by
that
horrid
planter
and
her
daughter
who
had
thought
proper
to
fall
ill
she
always
fell
ill
in
and
she
could
not
or
would
not
be
moved
for
some
laura
no
it
was
indeed
very
provoking
had
hoped
to
hear
one
of
dearest
b
dear
songs
on
friday
but
she
was
the
more
consoled
to
wait
because
lady
was
not
very
well
and
liked
to
be
nursed
by
her
poor
major
pendennis
was
very
unwell
too
in
the
same
hotel
too
unwell
even
to
see
arthur
who
was
constant
in
his
calls
on
his
uncle
heart
was
full
of
tenderness
and
affection
she
had
known
arthur
all
her
life
she
would
answer
yes
even
in
italics
she
would
answer
for
his
kindness
his
goodness
and
his
blanche
no
what
is
this
most
surprising
most
extraordinary
letter
from
what
does
dearest
laura
know
about
it
what
has
happened
what
what
mystery
is
enveloped
under
his
frightful
reserve
blanche
no
requires
an
explanation
and
it
can
not
be
better
given
than
in
the
surprising
and
mysterious
letter
of
arthur
pendennis
chapter
lxxiii
and
sam
huxter
dear
blanche
arthur
wrote
you
are
always
reading
and
dreaming
pretty
dramas
and
exciting
romances
in
real
life
are
you
now
prepared
to
enact
a
part
of
one
and
not
the
pleasantest
part
dear
blanche
that
in
which
the
heroine
takes
possession
of
her
father
palace
and
wealth
and
introducing
her
husband
to
the
loyal
retainers
and
faithful
vassals
greets
her
happy
bridegroom
with
of
this
is
mine
and
thine
but
the
other
character
that
of
the
luckless
lady
who
suddenly
discovers
that
she
is
not
the
prince
wife
but
claude
melnotte
the
beggar
that
of
alnaschar
wife
who
comes
in
just
as
her
husband
has
kicked
over
the
tray
of
porcelain
which
was
to
be
the
making
of
his
fortune
but
stay
alnaschar
who
kicked
down
the
china
was
not
a
married
man
he
had
cast
his
eye
on
the
vizier
daughter
and
his
hopes
of
her
went
to
the
ground
with
the
shattered
bowls
and
will
you
be
the
vizier
daughter
and
refuse
and
laugh
to
scorn
alnaschar
or
will
you
be
the
lady
of
lyons
and
love
the
penniless
claude
melnotte
i
will
act
that
part
if
you
like
i
will
love
you
my
best
in
return
i
will
do
my
all
to
make
your
humble
life
happy
for
humble
it
will
be
at
least
the
odds
are
against
any
other
conclusion
we
shall
live
and
die
in
a
poor
prosy
humdrum
way
there
will
be
no
stars
and
epaulettes
for
the
hero
of
our
story
i
shall
write
one
or
two
more
stories
which
will
presently
be
forgotten
i
shall
be
called
to
the
bar
and
try
to
get
on
in
my
profession
perhaps
some
day
if
i
am
very
lucky
and
work
very
hard
which
is
absurd
i
may
get
a
colonial
appointment
and
you
may
be
an
indian
judge
lady
meanwhile
i
shall
buy
back
the
pall
mall
gazette
the
publishers
are
tired
of
it
since
the
death
of
poor
shandon
and
will
sell
it
for
a
small
sum
warrington
will
be
my
right
hand
and
write
it
up
to
a
respectable
sale
i
will
introduce
you
to
finucane
the
and
i
know
who
in
the
end
will
be
finucane
a
very
nice
gentle
creature
who
has
lived
sweetly
through
a
sad
life
and
we
will
jog
on
i
say
and
look
out
for
better
times
and
earn
our
living
decently
you
shall
have
the
and
superintend
the
fashionable
intelligence
and
break
your
little
heart
in
the
poet
corner
shall
we
live
over
the
offices
there
are
four
very
good
rooms
a
kitchen
and
a
garret
for
laura
in
catherine
street
in
the
strand
or
would
you
like
a
house
in
the
waterloo
road
it
would
be
very
pleasant
only
there
is
that
halfpenny
toll
at
the
bridge
the
boys
may
go
to
king
college
they
does
all
this
read
to
you
like
a
joke
ah
dear
blanche
it
is
no
joke
and
i
am
sober
and
telling
the
truth
our
fine
are
gone
our
carriage
has
whirled
out
of
sight
like
cinderella
our
house
in
belgravia
has
been
whisked
away
into
the
air
by
a
malevolent
genius
and
i
am
no
more
a
member
of
parliament
than
i
am
a
bishop
on
his
bench
in
the
house
of
lords
or
a
duke
with
a
garter
at
his
knee
you
know
pretty
well
what
my
property
is
and
your
own
little
fortune
we
may
have
enough
with
those
two
to
live
in
decent
comfort
to
take
a
cab
sometimes
when
we
go
out
to
see
our
friends
and
not
to
deny
ourselves
an
omnibus
when
we
are
tired
but
that
is
all
is
that
enough
for
you
my
little
dainty
lady
i
doubt
sometimes
whether
you
can
bear
the
life
which
i
offer
you
at
least
it
is
fair
that
you
should
know
what
it
will
be
if
you
say
arthur
i
will
follow
your
fate
whatever
it
may
be
and
be
a
loyal
and
loving
wife
to
aid
and
cheer
you
come
to
me
dear
blanche
and
may
god
help
me
so
that
i
may
do
my
duty
to
you
if
not
and
you
look
to
a
higher
station
i
must
not
bar
blanche
fortune
i
will
stand
in
the
crowd
and
see
your
ladyship
go
to
court
when
you
are
presented
and
you
shall
give
me
a
smile
from
your
chariot
window
i
saw
lady
mirabel
going
to
the
last
season
the
happy
husband
at
her
side
glittered
with
stars
and
cordons
all
the
flowers
in
the
garden
bloomed
in
the
coachman
bosom
will
you
have
these
and
the
chariot
or
walk
on
foot
and
mend
your
stockings
i
can
not
tell
you
now
afterwards
i
might
should
the
day
come
when
we
may
have
no
secrets
from
one
another
what
has
happened
within
the
last
few
hours
which
has
changed
all
my
prospects
in
life
but
so
it
is
that
i
have
learned
something
which
forces
me
to
give
up
the
plans
which
i
had
formed
and
many
vain
and
ambitious
hopes
in
which
i
had
been
indulging
i
have
written
and
despatched
a
letter
to
sir
francis
clavering
saying
that
i
can
not
accept
his
seat
in
parliament
until
after
my
marriage
in
like
manner
i
can
not
and
will
not
accept
any
larger
fortune
with
you
than
that
which
has
always
belonged
to
you
since
your
grandfather
death
and
the
birth
of
your
your
good
mother
is
not
in
the
least
aware
i
hope
she
never
may
be
of
the
reasons
which
force
me
to
this
very
strange
decision
they
arise
from
a
painful
circumstance
which
is
attributable
to
none
of
our
faults
but
having
once
befallen
they
are
as
fatal
and
irreparable
as
that
shock
which
overset
honest
alnaschar
porcelain
and
shattered
all
his
hopes
beyond
the
power
of
mending
i
write
gaily
enough
for
there
is
no
use
in
bewailing
such
a
hopeless
mischance
we
have
not
drawn
the
great
prize
in
the
lottery
dear
blanche
but
i
shall
be
contented
enough
without
it
if
you
can
be
so
and
i
repeat
with
all
my
heart
that
i
will
do
my
best
to
make
you
happy
and
now
what
news
shall
i
give
you
my
uncle
is
very
unwell
and
takes
my
refusal
of
the
seat
in
parliament
in
sad
dudgeon
the
scheme
was
his
poor
old
gentleman
and
he
naturally
bemoans
its
failure
but
warrington
laura
and
i
had
a
council
of
war
they
know
this
awful
secret
and
back
me
in
my
decision
you
must
love
george
as
you
love
what
is
generous
and
upright
and
noble
and
as
for
laura
she
must
be
our
sister
blanche
our
saint
our
good
angel
with
two
such
friends
at
home
what
need
we
care
for
the
world
without
or
who
is
member
for
clavering
or
who
is
asked
or
not
asked
to
the
great
balls
of
the
season
to
this
frank
communication
came
back
the
letter
from
blanche
to
laura
and
one
to
pen
himself
which
perhaps
his
own
letter
justified
you
are
spoiled
by
the
world
blanche
wrote
you
do
not
love
your
poor
blanche
as
she
would
be
loved
or
you
would
not
offer
thus
lightly
to
take
her
or
to
leave
her
no
arthur
you
love
me
not
a
man
of
the
world
you
have
given
me
your
plighted
troth
and
are
ready
to
redeem
it
but
that
entire
affection
that
love
whole
and
abiding
where
where
is
that
vision
of
my
youth
i
am
but
a
pastime
of
your
life
and
i
would
be
its
all
but
a
fleeting
thought
and
i
would
be
your
whole
soul
i
would
have
our
two
hearts
one
but
ah
my
arthur
how
lonely
yours
is
how
little
you
give
me
of
it
you
speak
of
our
parting
with
a
smile
on
your
lip
of
our
meeting
and
you
care
not
to
hasten
it
is
life
but
a
disillusion
then
and
are
the
flowers
of
our
garden
faded
away
i
have
wept
i
have
prayed
i
have
passed
sleepless
hours
i
have
shed
bitter
bitter
tears
over
your
letter
to
you
i
bring
the
gushing
poesy
of
my
being
the
yearnings
of
the
soul
that
longs
to
be
loved
that
pines
for
love
love
love
beyond
all
that
flings
itself
at
your
feet
and
cries
love
me
arthur
your
heart
beats
no
quicker
at
the
kneeling
appeal
of
my
love
your
proud
eye
is
dimmed
by
no
tear
of
sympathy
you
accept
my
soul
treasure
as
though
dross
not
the
pearls
from
the
unfathomable
deeps
of
affection
not
the
diamonds
from
the
caverns
of
the
heart
you
treat
me
like
a
slave
and
bid
me
bow
to
my
master
is
this
the
guerdon
of
a
free
maiden
is
this
the
price
of
a
life
passion
ah
me
when
was
it
otherwise
when
did
love
meet
with
aught
but
disappointment
could
i
hope
fond
fool
to
be
the
exception
to
the
lot
of
my
race
and
lay
my
fevered
brow
on
a
heart
that
comprehended
my
own
foolish
girl
that
i
was
one
by
one
all
the
flowers
of
my
young
life
have
faded
away
and
this
the
last
the
sweetest
the
dearest
the
fondly
the
madly
loved
the
wildly
cherished
where
is
it
but
no
more
of
this
heed
not
my
bleeding
bless
you
bless
you
always
arthur
i
will
write
more
when
i
am
more
collected
my
racking
brain
renders
thought
almost
impossible
i
long
to
see
laura
she
will
come
to
us
directly
we
return
from
the
country
will
she
not
and
you
cold
one
the
words
of
this
letter
were
perfectly
clear
and
written
in
neatest
hand
upon
her
scented
paper
and
yet
the
meaning
of
the
composition
not
a
little
puzzled
pen
did
blanche
mean
to
accept
or
to
refuse
his
polite
offer
her
phrases
either
meant
that
pen
did
not
love
her
and
she
declined
him
or
that
she
took
him
and
sacrificed
herself
to
him
cold
as
he
was
he
laughed
sardonically
over
the
letter
and
over
the
transaction
which
occasioned
it
he
laughed
to
think
how
fortune
had
jilted
him
and
how
he
deserved
his
slippery
fortune
he
turned
over
and
over
the
musky
riddle
it
amused
his
humour
he
enjoyed
it
as
if
it
had
been
a
funny
story
he
was
thus
seated
twiddling
the
queer
manuscript
in
his
hand
joking
grimly
to
himself
when
his
servant
came
in
with
a
card
from
a
gentleman
who
wished
to
speak
to
him
very
particularly
and
if
pen
had
gone
out
into
the
passage
he
would
have
seen
sucking
his
stick
rolling
his
eyes
and
showing
great
marks
of
anxiety
his
old
acquaintance
samuel
huxter
mr
huxter
on
particular
business
pray
beg
huxter
to
come
in
said
pen
amused
rather
and
not
the
less
so
when
poor
sam
appeared
before
him
pray
take
a
chair
huxter
said
pen
in
his
most
superb
manner
in
what
way
can
i
be
of
service
to
you
i
had
rather
not
speak
before
the
flunk
before
the
man
pendennis
on
which
arthur
attendant
quitted
the
room
i
in
a
fix
said
huxter
gloomily
she
sent
me
to
you
continued
the
young
surgeon
what
fanny
is
she
well
i
was
coming
to
see
her
but
i
have
had
a
great
deal
of
business
since
my
return
to
i
heard
of
you
through
my
governor
and
jack
hobnell
broke
in
huxter
i
wish
you
joy
pendennis
both
of
the
borough
and
the
lady
sir
fanny
wishes
you
joy
too
he
added
with
something
of
a
blush
there
many
a
slip
between
the
cup
and
the
lip
who
knows
what
may
happen
huxter
or
who
will
sit
in
parliament
for
clavering
next
session
you
can
do
anything
with
my
governor
continued
huxter
you
got
him
clavering
park
the
old
boy
was
very
much
pleased
sir
at
your
calling
him
in
hobnell
wrote
me
so
do
you
think
you
could
speak
to
the
governor
for
me
pendennis
and
tell
him
what
i
gone
and
done
it
sir
said
huxter
with
a
particular
look
you
you
do
mean
to
say
you
have
you
have
done
any
wrong
to
that
dear
little
creature
sir
said
pen
starting
up
in
a
great
fury
i
hope
not
said
huxter
with
a
hangdog
look
but
i
married
her
and
i
know
there
will
be
an
awful
shindy
at
home
it
was
agreed
that
i
should
be
taken
into
partnership
when
i
had
passed
the
college
and
it
was
to
have
been
huxter
and
son
but
i
would
have
it
confound
it
all
over
now
and
the
old
boy
wrote
me
that
he
coming
up
to
town
for
drugs
he
will
be
here
and
then
it
must
all
come
and
when
did
this
event
happen
asked
pen
not
over
well
pleased
most
likely
that
a
person
who
had
once
attracted
some
portion
of
his
royal
good
graces
should
have
transferred
her
allegiance
and
consoled
herself
for
his
loss
last
thursday
was
five
weeks
it
was
two
days
after
miss
amory
came
to
shepherd
inn
huxter
answered
pen
remembered
that
blanche
had
written
and
mentioned
her
visit
i
was
called
in
huxter
said
i
was
in
the
inn
looking
after
old
cos
leg
and
about
something
else
too
very
likely
and
i
met
strong
who
told
me
there
was
a
woman
taken
ill
in
chambers
and
went
up
to
give
her
my
professional
services
it
was
the
old
lady
who
attends
miss
amory
her
housekeeper
or
some
such
thing
she
was
taken
with
strong
hysterics
i
found
her
kicking
and
screaming
like
a
good
one
in
strong
chamber
along
with
him
and
colonel
altamont
and
miss
amory
crying
and
as
pale
as
a
sheet
and
altamont
fuming
about
a
regular
they
were
two
hours
in
the
chambers
and
the
old
woman
went
whooping
off
in
a
cab
she
was
much
worse
than
the
young
one
i
called
in
grosvenor
place
next
day
to
see
if
i
could
be
of
any
service
but
they
were
gone
without
so
much
as
thanking
me
and
the
day
after
i
had
business
of
my
own
to
attend
to
a
bad
business
too
said
huxter
gloomily
but
it
done
and
ca
be
undone
and
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
she
has
known
the
story
for
a
month
thought
pen
with
a
sharp
pang
of
grief
and
a
gloomy
sympathy
this
accounts
for
her
letter
of
she
will
not
implicate
her
father
or
divulge
his
secret
she
wishes
to
let
me
off
from
the
marriage
and
finds
a
pretext
the
generous
girl
do
you
know
who
altamont
is
sir
asked
huxter
after
the
pause
during
which
pen
had
been
thinking
of
his
own
affairs
fanny
and
i
have
talked
him
over
and
we
ca
help
fancying
that
it
lightfoot
first
husband
come
to
life
again
and
she
who
has
just
married
a
second
perhaps
lightfoot
wo
be
very
sorry
for
it
sighed
huxter
looking
savagely
at
arthur
for
the
demon
of
jealousy
was
still
in
possession
of
his
soul
and
now
and
more
than
ever
since
his
marriage
the
poor
fellow
fancied
that
fanny
heart
belonged
to
his
rival
let
us
talk
about
your
affairs
said
pen
show
me
how
i
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
huxter
let
me
congratulate
you
on
your
marriage
i
am
thankful
that
fanny
who
is
so
good
so
fascinating
so
kind
a
creature
has
found
an
honest
man
and
a
gentleman
who
will
make
her
happy
show
me
what
i
can
do
to
help
she
thinks
you
can
sir
said
huxter
accepting
pen
proffered
hand
and
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
i
sure
and
that
you
might
talk
over
my
father
and
break
the
business
to
him
and
my
mother
who
always
has
her
back
up
about
being
a
clergyman
daughter
fanny
ai
of
a
good
family
i
know
and
not
up
to
us
in
breeding
and
that
but
she
a
huxter
the
wife
takes
the
husband
rank
of
course
said
pen
and
with
a
little
practice
in
society
continued
huxter
imbibing
his
stick
she
be
as
good
as
any
girl
in
clavering
you
should
hear
her
sing
and
play
on
the
piano
did
you
ever
old
bows
taught
her
and
she
do
on
the
stage
if
the
governor
was
to
throw
me
over
but
i
rather
not
have
her
there
she
ca
help
being
a
coquette
pendennis
she
ca
help
it
dammy
sir
i
be
bound
to
say
that
two
or
three
of
the
bartholomew
chaps
that
i
brought
into
my
place
are
sitting
with
her
now
even
jack
linton
that
i
took
down
as
my
best
man
is
as
bad
as
the
rest
and
she
will
go
on
singing
and
making
eyes
at
him
it
what
bows
says
if
there
were
twenty
men
in
a
room
and
one
not
taking
notice
of
her
she
would
be
satisfied
until
the
twentieth
was
at
her
you
should
have
her
mother
with
her
said
pen
laughing
she
must
keep
the
lodge
she
ca
see
so
much
of
her
family
as
she
used
i
ca
you
know
sir
go
on
with
that
lot
consider
my
rank
in
life
said
huxter
putting
a
very
dirty
hand
up
to
his
chin
au
fait
said
mr
pen
who
was
infinitely
amused
and
concerning
whom
mutato
nomine
and
of
course
concerning
nobody
else
in
the
world
the
fable
might
have
been
narrated
as
the
two
gentlemen
were
in
the
midst
of
this
colloquy
another
knock
came
to
pen
door
and
his
servant
presently
announced
bows
the
old
man
followed
slowly
his
pale
face
blushing
and
his
hand
trembling
somewhat
as
he
took
pen
he
coughed
and
wiped
his
face
in
his
checked
cotton
and
sate
down
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
the
sunshining
on
his
bald
head
pen
looked
at
the
homely
figure
with
no
small
sympathy
and
kindness
this
man
too
has
had
his
griefs
and
his
wounds
arthur
thought
this
man
too
has
brought
his
genius
and
his
heart
and
laid
them
at
a
woman
feet
where
she
spurned
them
the
chance
of
life
has
gone
against
him
and
the
prize
is
with
that
creature
yonder
fanny
bridegroom
thus
mutely
apostrophised
had
winked
meanwhile
with
one
eye
at
old
bows
and
was
driving
holes
in
the
floor
with
the
cane
which
he
loved
so
we
have
lost
bows
and
here
is
the
lucky
winner
pen
said
looking
hard
at
the
old
man
here
is
the
lucky
winner
sir
as
you
i
suppose
you
have
come
from
my
place
asked
huxter
who
having
winked
at
bows
with
one
eye
now
favoured
pen
with
a
wink
of
the
other
a
wink
which
seemed
to
say
infatuated
old
boy
you
understand
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
her
poor
old
yes
i
have
been
there
ever
since
you
went
away
it
was
sam
who
sent
me
after
you
who
said
that
she
thought
you
might
be
doing
something
stupid
something
like
yourself
there
as
big
fools
as
i
am
growled
the
young
surgeon
a
few
said
the
old
man
not
many
let
us
trust
yes
she
sent
me
after
you
for
fear
you
should
offend
pendennis
and
i
daresay
because
she
thought
you
would
give
her
message
to
him
and
beg
him
to
go
and
see
her
and
she
knew
i
would
take
her
errand
did
he
tell
you
that
sir
huxter
blushed
scarlet
and
covered
his
confusion
with
an
imprecation
pen
laughed
the
scene
suited
his
bitter
humour
more
and
more
i
have
no
doubt
huxter
was
going
to
tell
me
arthur
said
and
very
much
flattered
i
am
sure
i
shall
be
to
pay
my
respects
to
his
it
in
charterhouse
lane
over
the
baker
on
the
right
hand
side
as
you
go
from
john
street
continued
bows
without
any
pity
you
know
smithfield
pendennis
john
street
leads
into
smithfield
doctor
johnson
has
been
down
the
street
many
a
time
with
ragged
shoes
and
a
bundle
of
for
the
gent
magazine
you
literary
gents
are
better
off
now
eh
you
ride
in
your
cabs
and
wear
yellow
kid
gloves
i
have
known
so
many
brave
and
good
men
fail
and
so
many
quacks
and
impostors
succeed
that
you
mistake
me
if
you
think
i
am
puffed
up
by
my
own
personal
good
luck
old
friend
arthur
said
sadly
do
you
think
the
prizes
of
life
are
carried
by
the
most
deserving
and
set
up
that
mean
test
of
prosperity
for
merit
you
must
feel
that
you
are
as
good
as
i
have
never
questioned
it
it
is
you
that
are
peevish
against
the
freaks
of
fortune
and
grudge
the
good
luck
that
befalls
others
not
the
first
time
you
have
unjustly
accused
me
perhaps
you
are
not
far
wrong
sir
said
the
old
fellow
wiping
his
bald
forehead
i
am
thinking
about
myself
and
grumbling
most
men
do
when
they
get
on
that
subject
here
the
fellow
that
got
the
prize
in
the
lottery
here
the
fortunate
i
do
know
what
you
are
driving
at
huxter
said
who
had
been
much
puzzled
as
the
above
remarks
passed
between
his
two
companions
perhaps
not
said
bows
drily
mrs
sent
me
here
to
look
after
you
and
to
see
that
you
brought
that
little
message
to
pendennis
which
you
did
you
see
and
so
she
was
right
women
always
are
they
have
always
a
reason
for
everything
why
sir
he
said
turning
round
to
pen
with
a
sneer
she
had
a
reason
even
for
giving
me
that
message
i
was
sitting
with
her
after
you
left
us
very
quiet
and
comfortable
i
was
talking
away
and
she
was
mending
your
shirts
when
your
two
young
friends
jack
linton
and
bob
blades
looked
in
from
bartholomew
and
then
it
was
she
found
out
that
she
had
this
message
to
send
you
hurry
yourself
she
do
want
you
back
again
they
stay
these
two
hours
i
huxter
arose
with
great
perturbation
at
this
news
and
plunged
his
stick
into
the
pocket
of
his
paletot
and
seized
his
hat
you
come
and
see
us
sir
wo
you
he
said
to
pen
you
talk
over
the
governor
wo
you
sir
if
i
can
get
out
of
this
place
and
down
to
clavering
you
will
promise
to
attend
me
gratis
if
ever
i
fall
ill
at
fairoaks
will
you
huxter
pen
said
i
will
do
anything
i
can
for
you
i
will
come
and
see
huxter
immediately
and
we
will
conspire
together
about
what
is
to
be
i
thought
that
would
send
him
out
sir
bows
said
dropping
into
his
chair
again
as
soon
as
the
young
surgeon
had
quitted
the
room
and
all
true
sir
every
word
of
it
she
wants
you
back
again
and
sends
her
husband
after
you
she
cajoles
everybody
the
little
devil
she
tries
it
on
you
on
me
on
poor
costigan
on
the
young
chaps
from
bartholomew
she
got
a
little
court
of
already
and
if
there
nobody
there
she
practises
on
the
old
german
baker
in
the
shop
or
coaxes
the
black
sweeper
at
the
is
she
fond
of
that
fellow
asked
pen
there
is
no
accounting
for
likes
and
dislikes
bows
answered
yes
she
is
fond
of
him
and
having
taken
the
thing
into
her
head
she
would
not
rest
until
she
married
him
they
had
their
banns
published
at
clement
and
nobody
heard
it
or
knew
any
just
cause
or
impediment
and
one
day
she
slips
out
of
the
porter
lodge
and
has
the
business
done
and
goes
off
to
gravesend
with
lothario
and
leaves
a
note
for
me
to
go
and
explain
all
things
to
her
ma
bless
you
the
old
woman
knew
it
as
well
as
i
did
though
she
pretended
ignorance
and
so
she
goes
and
i
alone
again
i
miss
her
sir
tripping
along
that
court
and
coming
for
her
singing
lesson
and
i
no
heart
to
look
into
the
lodge
now
which
looks
very
empty
without
her
the
little
flirting
thing
and
i
go
and
sit
and
dangle
about
her
lodgings
like
an
old
fool
she
makes
very
trim
and
nice
though
gets
up
all
huxter
shirts
and
clothes
cooks
his
little
dinner
and
sings
at
her
business
like
a
little
lark
what
the
use
of
being
angry
i
lent
three
pound
to
go
on
with
for
they
have
got
a
shilling
till
the
reconciliation
and
pa
comes
when
bows
had
taken
his
leave
pen
carried
his
letter
from
blanche
and
the
news
which
he
had
just
received
to
his
usual
adviser
laura
it
was
wonderful
upon
how
many
points
arthur
who
generally
followed
his
own
opinion
now
wanted
another
person
counsel
he
could
hardly
so
much
as
choose
a
waistcoat
without
referring
to
miss
bell
if
he
wanted
to
buy
a
horse
he
must
have
miss
bell
opinion
all
which
marks
of
deference
tended
greatly
to
the
amusement
of
the
shrewd
old
lady
with
whom
miss
bell
lived
and
whose
plans
regarding
her
protegee
we
have
indicated
arthur
produced
blanche
letter
then
to
laura
and
asked
her
to
interpret
it
laura
was
very
much
agitated
and
puzzled
by
the
contents
of
the
note
it
seems
to
me
she
said
as
if
blanche
is
acting
very
and
wishes
so
to
place
matters
that
she
may
take
me
or
leave
me
is
it
not
so
it
is
i
am
afraid
a
kind
of
duplicity
which
does
not
augur
well
for
your
future
happiness
and
is
a
bad
reply
to
your
own
candour
and
honesty
arthur
do
you
know
i
think
i
think
i
scarcely
like
to
say
what
i
think
said
laura
with
a
deep
blush
but
of
course
the
blushing
young
lady
yielded
to
her
cousin
persuasion
and
expressed
what
her
thoughts
were
it
looks
to
me
arthur
as
if
there
might
be
there
might
be
somebody
else
said
laura
with
a
repetition
of
the
blush
and
if
there
is
broke
in
arthur
and
if
i
am
free
once
again
will
the
best
and
dearest
of
all
women
you
are
not
free
dear
brother
laura
said
calmly
you
belong
to
another
of
whom
i
own
it
grieves
me
to
think
ill
but
i
ca
do
otherwise
it
is
very
odd
that
in
this
letter
she
does
not
urge
you
to
tell
her
the
reason
why
you
have
broken
arrangements
which
would
have
been
so
advantageous
to
you
and
avoids
speaking
on
the
subject
she
somehow
seems
to
write
as
if
she
knows
her
father
pen
said
yes
she
must
know
it
and
told
the
story
which
he
had
just
heard
from
huxter
of
the
interview
at
shepherd
inn
it
was
not
so
that
she
described
the
meeting
said
laura
and
going
to
her
desk
produced
from
it
that
letter
of
blanche
which
mentioned
her
visit
to
shepherd
inn
disappointment
only
the
chevalier
strong
and
a
friend
of
his
in
the
room
this
was
all
that
blanche
had
said
but
she
was
bound
to
keep
her
father
secret
pen
laura
added
and
yet
and
yet
it
is
very
the
puzzle
was
this
that
for
three
weeks
after
this
eventful
discovery
blanche
had
been
only
too
eager
about
her
dearest
arthur
was
urging
as
strongly
as
so
much
modesty
could
urge
the
completion
of
the
happy
arrangements
which
were
to
make
her
arthur
for
ever
and
now
it
seemed
as
if
something
had
interfered
to
mar
these
happy
arrangements
as
if
arthur
poor
was
not
quite
so
agreeable
to
blanche
as
arthur
rich
and
a
member
of
parliament
as
if
there
was
some
mystery
at
last
she
said
tunbridge
wells
is
not
very
far
off
is
it
arthur
had
you
better
go
and
see
her
they
had
been
in
town
a
week
and
neither
had
thought
of
that
simple
plan
before
chapter
lxxiv
shows
how
arthur
had
better
have
taken
a
the
train
carried
arthur
only
too
quickly
to
tunbridge
though
he
had
time
to
review
all
the
circumstances
of
his
life
as
he
made
the
brief
journey
and
to
acknowledge
to
what
sad
conclusions
his
selfishness
and
waywardness
had
led
him
here
is
the
end
of
hopes
and
aspirations
thought
he
of
romance
and
ambitions
where
i
yield
or
where
i
am
obstinate
i
am
alike
unfortunate
my
mother
implores
me
and
i
refuse
an
angel
say
i
had
taken
her
forced
on
me
as
she
was
laura
would
never
have
been
an
angel
to
me
i
could
not
have
given
her
my
heart
at
another
instigation
i
never
could
have
known
her
as
she
is
had
i
been
obliged
to
ask
another
to
interpret
her
qualities
and
point
out
her
virtues
i
yield
to
my
uncle
solicitations
and
accept
on
his
guarantee
blanche
and
a
seat
in
parliament
and
wealth
and
ambition
and
a
career
and
see
fortune
comes
and
leaves
me
the
wife
without
the
dowry
which
i
had
taken
in
compensation
of
a
heart
why
was
i
not
more
honest
or
am
i
not
less
so
it
would
have
cost
my
poor
old
uncle
no
pangs
to
accept
blanche
fortune
whencesoever
it
came
he
ca
even
understand
he
is
bitterly
indignant
almost
at
the
scruples
which
actuate
me
in
refusing
it
i
dissatisfy
everybody
a
maimed
weak
imperfect
wretch
it
seems
as
if
i
am
unequal
to
any
fortune
i
neither
make
myself
nor
any
one
connected
with
me
happy
what
prospect
is
there
for
this
poor
little
frivolous
girl
who
is
to
take
my
obscure
name
and
share
my
fortune
i
have
not
even
ambition
to
excite
me
or
enough
to
console
myself
much
more
her
for
my
failure
if
i
were
to
write
a
book
that
should
go
through
twenty
editions
why
i
should
be
the
very
first
to
sneer
at
my
reputation
say
i
could
succeed
at
the
bar
and
achieve
a
fortune
by
bullying
witnesses
and
twisting
evidence
is
that
a
fame
which
would
satisfy
my
longings
or
a
calling
in
which
my
life
would
be
well
spent
how
i
wish
i
could
be
that
priest
opposite
who
never
has
lifted
his
eyes
from
his
breviary
except
when
we
were
in
reigate
tunnel
when
he
could
not
see
or
that
old
gentleman
next
him
who
scowls
at
him
with
eyes
of
hatred
over
his
newspaper
the
priest
shuts
his
eyes
to
the
world
but
has
his
thoughts
on
the
book
which
is
his
directory
to
the
world
to
come
his
neighbour
hates
him
as
a
monster
tyrant
persecutor
and
fancies
burning
martyrs
and
that
pale
countenance
looking
on
and
lighted
up
by
the
flame
these
have
no
doubts
these
march
on
trustfully
bearing
their
load
of
would
you
like
to
look
at
the
paper
sir
here
interposed
the
stout
gentleman
it
had
a
flaming
article
against
the
order
of
the
gentleman
who
was
travelling
with
them
in
the
carriage
and
pen
thanked
him
and
took
it
and
pursued
his
reverie
without
reading
two
sentences
of
the
journal
and
yet
would
you
take
either
of
those
men
creeds
with
its
consequences
he
thought
ah
me
you
must
bear
your
own
burthen
fashion
your
own
faith
think
your
own
thoughts
and
pray
your
own
prayer
to
what
mortal
ear
could
i
tell
all
if
i
had
a
mind
or
who
could
understand
all
who
can
tell
another
shortcomings
lost
opportunities
weigh
the
passions
which
overpower
the
defects
which
incapacitate
reason
what
extent
of
truth
and
right
his
mind
is
organised
to
perceive
and
to
do
what
invisible
and
forgotten
accident
terror
of
youth
chance
or
mischance
of
fortune
may
have
altered
the
whole
current
of
life
a
grain
of
sand
may
alter
it
as
the
flinging
of
a
pebble
may
end
it
who
can
weigh
circumstances
passions
temptations
that
go
to
our
good
and
evil
account
save
one
before
whose
awful
wisdom
we
kneel
and
at
whose
mercy
we
ask
absolution
here
it
ends
thought
pen
this
day
or
will
wind
up
the
account
of
my
youth
a
weary
retrospect
alas
a
sad
history
with
many
a
page
i
would
fain
not
look
back
on
but
who
has
not
been
tired
or
fallen
and
who
has
escaped
without
scars
from
that
struggle
and
his
head
fell
on
his
breast
and
the
young
man
heart
prostrated
itself
humbly
and
sadly
before
that
throne
where
sits
wisdom
and
love
and
pity
for
all
and
made
its
confession
what
matters
about
fame
or
poverty
he
thought
if
i
marry
this
woman
i
have
chosen
may
i
have
strength
and
will
to
be
true
to
her
and
to
make
her
happy
if
i
have
children
pray
god
teach
me
to
speak
and
to
do
the
truth
among
them
and
to
leave
them
an
honest
name
there
are
no
splendours
for
my
marriage
does
my
life
deserve
any
i
begin
a
new
phase
of
it
a
better
than
the
last
may
it
be
i
pray
heaven
the
train
stopped
at
tunbridge
as
pen
was
making
these
reflections
and
he
handed
over
the
newspaper
to
his
neighbour
of
whom
he
took
leave
while
the
foreign
clergyman
in
the
opposite
corner
still
sate
with
his
eyes
on
his
book
pen
jumped
out
of
the
carriage
then
his
in
hand
and
briskly
determined
to
face
his
fortune
a
fly
carried
him
rapidly
to
lady
clavering
house
from
the
station
and
as
he
was
transported
thither
arthur
composed
a
little
speech
which
he
intended
to
address
to
blanche
and
which
was
really
as
virtuous
honest
and
an
oration
as
any
man
of
his
turn
of
mind
and
under
his
circumstances
could
have
uttered
the
purport
of
it
was
blanche
i
can
not
understand
from
your
last
letter
what
your
meaning
is
or
whether
my
fair
and
frank
proposal
to
you
is
acceptable
or
no
i
think
you
know
the
reason
which
induces
me
to
forgo
the
worldly
advantages
which
a
union
with
you
offered
and
which
i
could
not
accept
without
as
i
fancy
being
dishonoured
if
you
doubt
of
my
affection
here
i
am
ready
to
prove
it
let
smirke
be
called
in
and
let
us
be
married
out
of
hand
and
with
all
my
heart
i
purpose
to
keep
my
vow
and
to
cherish
you
through
life
and
to
be
a
true
and
a
loving
husband
to
from
the
fly
arthur
sprang
out
then
to
the
where
he
was
met
by
a
domestic
whom
he
did
not
know
the
man
seemed
to
be
surprised
at
the
approach
of
the
gentleman
with
the
which
he
made
no
attempt
to
take
from
arthur
hands
her
ladyship
not
at
home
sir
the
man
remarked
i
am
pendennis
arthur
said
where
is
lightfoot
lightfoot
is
gone
answered
the
man
my
lady
is
out
and
my
orders
was
i
hear
miss
amory
voice
in
the
said
arthur
take
the
bag
to
a
if
you
please
and
passing
by
the
porter
he
walked
straight
towards
that
apartment
from
which
as
the
door
opened
a
warble
of
melodious
notes
issued
our
little
siren
was
at
her
piano
singing
with
all
her
might
and
fascinations
master
clavering
was
asleep
on
the
sofa
indifferent
to
the
music
but
near
blanche
sat
a
gentleman
who
was
perfectly
enraptured
with
her
strain
which
was
of
a
passionate
and
melancholy
nature
as
the
door
opened
the
gentleman
started
up
with
hullo
the
music
stopped
with
a
little
shriek
from
the
singer
frank
clavering
woke
up
from
the
sofa
and
arthur
came
forward
and
said
what
foker
how
do
you
do
foker
he
looked
at
the
piano
and
there
by
miss
amory
side
was
just
such
another
box
as
he
had
seen
in
hand
three
days
before
when
the
heir
of
logwood
was
coming
out
of
a
jeweller
shop
in
waterloo
place
it
was
opened
and
curled
round
the
white
satin
cushion
within
was
oh
such
a
magnificent
serpentine
bracelet
with
such
a
blazing
ruby
head
and
diamond
tail
how
pendennis
said
foker
blanche
made
many
motions
of
the
shoulders
and
gave
signs
of
unrest
and
agitation
and
she
put
her
handkerchief
over
the
bracelet
and
then
she
advanced
with
a
hand
which
trembled
very
much
to
greet
pen
how
is
dearest
laura
she
said
the
face
of
foker
looking
up
from
his
profound
mourning
that
face
so
piteous
and
puzzled
was
one
which
the
reader
imagination
must
depict
for
himself
also
that
of
master
frank
clavering
who
looking
at
the
three
interesting
individuals
with
an
expression
of
the
utmost
knowingness
had
only
time
to
ejaculate
the
words
here
a
jolly
go
and
to
disappear
sniggering
pen
too
had
restrained
himself
up
to
that
minute
but
looking
still
at
foker
whose
ears
and
cheeks
tingled
with
blushes
arthur
burst
out
into
a
fit
of
laughter
so
wild
and
loud
that
it
frightened
blanche
much
more
than
any
the
most
serious
exhibition
and
this
was
the
secret
was
it
do
blush
and
turn
away
foker
my
boy
why
man
you
are
a
pattern
of
fidelity
could
i
stand
between
blanche
and
such
constancy
could
i
stand
between
miss
amory
and
fifteen
thousand
a
year
it
is
not
that
pendennis
blanche
said
with
great
dignity
it
is
not
money
it
is
not
rank
it
is
not
gold
that
moves
me
but
it
is
constancy
it
is
fidelity
it
is
a
whole
trustful
loving
heart
offered
to
me
that
i
treasure
yes
that
i
treasure
and
she
made
for
her
handkerchief
but
reflecting
what
was
underneath
it
she
paused
i
do
not
disown
i
do
not
disguise
my
life
is
above
disguise
to
him
on
whom
it
is
bestowed
my
heart
must
be
for
ever
bare
that
i
once
thought
i
loved
you
yes
thought
i
was
beloved
by
you
i
own
how
i
clung
to
that
faith
how
i
strove
i
prayed
i
longed
to
believe
it
but
your
conduct
always
your
own
words
so
cold
so
heartless
so
unkind
have
undeceived
me
you
trifled
with
the
heart
of
the
poor
maiden
you
flung
me
back
with
scorn
the
troth
which
i
had
plighted
i
have
explained
all
all
to
that
you
have
said
foker
with
devotion
and
conviction
in
his
looks
what
all
said
pen
with
a
meaning
look
at
blanche
it
is
i
am
in
fault
is
it
well
well
blanche
be
it
so
i
wo
appeal
against
your
sentence
and
bear
it
in
silence
i
came
down
here
looking
to
very
different
things
heaven
knows
and
with
a
heart
most
truly
and
kindly
disposed
towards
you
i
hope
you
may
be
happy
with
another
as
on
my
word
it
was
my
wish
to
make
you
so
and
i
hope
my
honest
old
friend
here
will
have
a
wife
worthy
of
his
loyalty
his
constancy
and
affection
indeed
they
deserve
the
regard
of
any
woman
even
miss
blanche
amory
shake
hands
harry
do
look
askance
at
me
has
anybody
told
you
that
i
was
a
false
and
heartless
character
i
think
you
a
foker
was
beginning
in
his
wrath
when
blanche
interposed
henry
not
a
word
i
pray
you
let
there
be
forgiveness
you
an
angel
by
jove
you
an
angel
said
foker
at
which
blanche
looked
seraphically
up
to
the
chandelier
in
spite
of
what
has
passed
for
the
sake
of
what
has
passed
i
must
always
regard
arthur
as
a
brother
the
seraph
continued
we
have
known
each
other
years
we
have
trodden
the
same
fields
and
plucked
the
same
flowers
together
arthur
henry
i
beseech
you
to
take
hands
and
to
be
friends
forgive
you
i
forgive
you
arthur
with
my
heart
i
do
should
i
not
do
so
for
making
me
so
happy
there
is
only
one
person
of
us
three
whom
i
pity
blanche
arthur
said
gravely
and
i
say
to
you
again
that
i
hope
you
will
make
this
good
fellow
this
honest
and
loyal
creature
happy
o
heavens
said
harry
he
could
not
speak
his
happiness
gushed
out
at
his
eyes
she
do
know
she
ca
know
how
fond
i
am
of
her
and
and
who
am
i
a
poor
little
beggar
and
she
takes
me
up
and
says
she
try
and
i
i
love
me
i
ai
worthy
of
so
much
happiness
give
us
your
hand
old
boy
since
she
forgives
you
after
your
heartless
conduct
and
says
she
loves
you
i
make
you
welcome
i
tell
you
love
everybody
who
loves
her
by
if
she
tells
me
to
kiss
the
ground

kiss
it
tell
me
to
kiss
the
ground
i
say
tell
me
i
love
you
so
you
see
i
love
you
blanche
looked
up
seraphically
again
her
gentle
bosom
heaved
she
held
out
one
hand
as
if
to
bless
harry
and
then
royally
permitted
him
to
kiss
it
she
took
up
the
and
hid
her
own
eyes
as
the
other
fair
hand
was
abandoned
to
poor
harry
tearful
embrace
i
swear
that
is
a
villain
who
deceives
such
a
loving
creature
as
that
said
pen
blanche
laid
down
the
handkerchief
and
put
hand
no
softly
on
head
which
was
bent
down
kissing
and
weeping
over
hand
no
foolish
boy
she
said
it
shall
be
loved
as
it
deserves
who
could
help
loving
such
a
silly
creature
and
at
this
moment
frank
clavering
broke
in
upon
the
sentimental
trio
i
say
pendennis
he
said
well
frank
the
man
wants
to
be
paid
and
go
back
he
had
some

go
back
with
him
cried
pen
blanche
god
bless
you
foker
old
friend

know
neither
of
you
want
me
he
longed
to
be
off
that
instant
stay
i
must
say
one
word
to
you
one
word
in
private
if
you
please
blanche
said
you
can
trust
us
together
ca

henry
the
tone
in
which
the
word
henry
was
spoken
and
the
appeal
ravished
foker
with
delight

said
he
oh
who
would
trust

along
franky
my
let
have
a
cigar

frank
as
they
went
into
the
hall
she

foker
gently
law

you
she
do

pendennis
used
to
smoke
regular
said
the
candid
youth
it
was
but
a
short
word
i
had
to
say
said
blanche
to
pen
with
great
calm
when
they
were
alone
you
never
loved
me
i
told
you
how
much

arthur
i
never
deceived
i
suppose
you
will
go
back
and

laura
continued
blanche
was
that
what
you
had
to
say
said
pen
you
are
going
to
her
this
very
night
i
am
sure
of
it
there
is
no
denying
it
you
never
cared
for
et
vous
et
moi
different
i
have
been
spoilt
early
i
can
not
live
out
of
the
world
out
of
excitement
i
could
have
done
so
but
it
is
too
late
if
i
can
not
have
emotions
i
must
have
the
world

would
offer
me
neither
one
nor
the
other
you
are
blase
in
everything
even
in
ambition
you
had
a
career
before
you
and
you
would
not
take
it
you
give
it
up
for
what
for
a
betise
for
an
absurd
scruple
why
would
you
not
have
that
seat

such
a
puritain

the
world
before

in

your
talent
and
give
a
place
in
the
world
to
yourself
to
your
wife

a
chapter
of
upon
the
platform
at
tunbridge
pen
fumed
and
fretted
until
the
arrival
of
the
evening
train
to
london
a
full
six
hours
it
seemed
to
him
but
even
this
immense
interval
was
passed
the
train
arrived
the
train
sped
on
the
london
lights
came
in
view
a
gentleman
who
forgot
his
in
the
train
rushed
at
a
cab
and
said
to
the
man
drive
as
hard
as
you
can
go
to
jermyn
the
cabman
although
a
said
thank
you
for
the
gratuity
which
was
put
into
his
hand
and
pen
ran
up
the
stairs
of
the
hotel
to
lady
apartments
laura
was
alone
in
the
reading
with
a
pale
face
by
the
lamp
the
pale
face
looked
up
when
pen
opened
the
door
may
we
follow
him
the
great
moments
of
life
are
but
moments
like
the
others
your
doom
is
spoken
in
a
word
or
two
a
single
look
from
the
eyes
a
mere
pressure
of
the
hand
may
decide
it
or
of
the
lips
though
they
can
not
speak
when
lady
rockminster
who
has
had
her
nap
gets
up
and
goes
into
her
we
may
enter
with
her
ladyship
upon
my
word
young
people
are
the
first
words
she
says
and
her
attendant
makes
wondering
eyes
over
her
shoulder
and
well
may
she
say
so
and
well
may
the
attendant
cast
wondering
eyes
for
the
young
people
are
in
an
attitude
and
pen
in
such
a
position
as
every
young
lady
who
reads
this
has
heard
tell
of
or
has
seen
or
hopes
or
at
any
rate
deserves
to
see
in
a
word
directly
he
entered
the
room
pen
went
up
to
laura
of
the
pale
face
who
had
not
time
even
to
say
what
back
so
soon
and
seizing
her
outstretched
and
trembling
hand
just
as
she
was
rising
from
her
chair
fell
down
on
his
knees
before
her
and
said
quickly
i
have
seen
her
she
has
engaged
herself
to
harry
foker
and
and
now
laura
the
hand
gives
a
pressure
the
eyes
beam
a
reply
the
quivering
lips
answer
though
speechless
pen
head
sinks
down
in
the
girl
lap
as
he
sobs
out
come
and
bless
us
dear
mother
and
arms
as
tender
as
helen
once
more
enfold
him
in
this
juncture
it
is
that
lady
rockminster
comes
in
and
says
upon
my
word
young
people
beck
leave
the
room
what
do
you
want
poking
your
nose
in
here
pen
starts
up
with
looks
of
triumph
still
holding
laura
hand
she
is
consoling
me
for
my
misfortune
he
says
what
do
you
mean
by
kissing
her
hand
i
do
know
what
you
will
be
next
pen
kissed
her
ladyship
i
have
been
to
tunbridge
he
says
and
seen
miss
amory
and
find
on
my
arrival
that
that
a
villain
has
transplanted
me
in
her
affections
he
says
with
a
tragedy
air
is
that
all
is
that
what
you
were
whimpering
on
your
knees
about
says
the
old
lady
growing
angry
you
might
have
kept
the
news
till
yes
another
has
superseded
me
goes
on
pen
but
why
call
him
villain
he
is
brave
he
is
constant
he
is
young
he
is
wealthy
he
is
what
stuff
are
you
talking
sir
cried
the
old
lady
what
has
happened
miss
amory
has
jilted
me
and
accepted
henry
foker
esq
i
found
her
warbling
ditties
to
him
as
he
lay
at
her
feet
presents
had
been
accepted
vows
exchanged
these
ten
days
harry
was
old
rheumatism
which
kept
dearest
laura
out
of
the
house
he
is
the
most
constant
and
generous
of
men
he
has
promised
the
living
of
logwood
to
lady
ann
husband
and
given
her
a
splendid
present
on
her
marriage
and
he
rushed
to
fling
himself
at
blanche
feet
the
instant
he
found
he
was
and
so
as
you
ca
get
blanche
you
put
up
with
laura
is
that
it
sir
asked
the
old
lady
he
acted
nobly
laura
said
i
acted
as
she
bade
me
said
pen
never
mind
how
lady
rockminster
but
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
and
power
and
if
you
mean
that
i
am
not
worthy
of
laura
i
know
it
and
pray
heaven
to
better
me
and
if
the
love
and
company
of
the
best
and
purest
creature
in
the
world
can
do
so
at
least
i
shall
have
these
to
help
hm
hm
replied
the
old
lady
to
this
looking
with
rather
an
appeased
air
at
the
young
people
it
is
all
very
well
but
i
should
have
preferred
and
now
pen
to
divert
the
conversation
from
a
theme
which
was
growing
painful
to
some
parties
present
bethought
him
of
his
interview
with
huxter
in
the
morning
and
of
fanny
bolton
affairs
which
he
had
forgotten
under
the
immediate
pressure
and
excitement
of
his
own
and
he
told
the
ladies
how
huxter
had
elevated
fanny
to
the
rank
of
wife
and
what
terrors
he
was
in
respecting
the
arrival
of
his
father
he
described
the
scene
with
considerable
humour
taking
care
to
dwell
especially
upon
that
part
of
it
which
concerned
fanny
coquetry
and
irrepressible
desire
of
captivating
mankind
his
meaning
being
you
see
laura
i
was
not
so
guilty
in
that
little
affair
it
was
the
girl
who
made
love
to
me
and
i
who
resisted
as
i
am
no
longer
present
the
little
siren
practises
her
arts
and
fascinations
upon
others
let
that
transaction
be
forgotten
in
your
mind
if
you
please
or
visit
me
with
a
very
gentle
punishment
for
my
laura
understood
his
meaning
under
the
eagerness
of
his
explanations
if
you
did
any
wrong
you
repented
dear
pen
she
said
and
you
know
she
added
with
meaning
eyes
and
blushes
that
i
have
no
right
to
reproach
hm
grumbled
the
old
lady
i
should
have
preferred
the
past
is
broken
away
the
morrow
is
before
us
i
will
do
my
best
to
make
your
morrow
happy
dear
laura
pen
said
his
heart
was
humbled
by
the
prospect
of
his
happiness
it
stood
awestricken
in
the
contemplation
of
her
sweet
goodness
and
purity
he
liked
his
wife
better
that
she
had
owned
to
that
passing
feeling
for
warrington
and
laid
bare
her
generous
heart
to
him
and
she
very
likely
she
was
thinking
how
strange
it
is
that
i
ever
should
have
cared
for
another
i
am
vexed
almost
to
think
i
care
for
him
so
little
am
so
little
sorry
that
he
is
gone
away
oh
in
these
past
two
months
how
i
have
learned
to
love
arthur
i
care
about
nothing
but
arthur
my
waking
and
sleeping
thoughts
are
about
him
he
is
never
absent
from
me
and
to
think
that
he
is
to
be
mine
mine
and
that
i
am
to
marry
him
and
not
to
be
his
servant
as
i
expected
to
be
only
this
morning
for
i
would
have
gone
down
on
my
knees
to
blanche
to
beg
her
to
let
me
live
with
him
and
now
oh
it
is
too
much
oh
mother
mother
that
you
were
here
indeed
she
felt
as
if
helen
were
there
by
her
actually
though
invisibly
a
halo
of
happiness
beamed
from
her
she
moved
with
a
different
step
and
bloomed
with
a
new
beauty
arthur
saw
the
change
and
the
old
lady
rockminster
remarked
it
with
her
shrewd
eyes
what
a
sly
demure
little
wretch
you
have
been
she
whispered
to
laura
while
pen
in
great
spirits
was
laughing
and
telling
his
story
about
huxter
and
how
you
have
kept
your
secret
how
are
we
to
help
the
young
couple
said
laura
of
course
miss
laura
felt
an
interest
in
all
young
couples
as
generous
lovers
always
love
other
lovers
we
must
go
and
see
them
said
pen
of
course
we
must
go
and
see
them
said
laura
i
intend
to
be
very
fond
of
fanny
let
us
go
this
instant
lady
rockminster
may
i
have
the
carriage
go
now
why
you
stupid
creature
it
is
eleven
at
night
and
huxter
have
got
their
nightcaps
on
i
dare
say
and
it
is
time
for
you
to
go
now
good
night
arthur
and
laura
begged
for
ten
minutes
more
we
will
go
morning
then
i
will
come
and
fetch
you
with
an
earl
coronet
said
pen
who
no
doubt
was
pleased
himself
will
have
a
great
effect
in
lamb
court
and
smithfield
stay
lady
rockminster
will
you
join
us
in
a
little
conspiracy
how
do
you
mean
conspiracy
young
man
will
you
please
to
be
a
little
ill
and
when
old
huxter
arrives
will
you
let
me
call
him
in
if
he
is
put
into
a
good
humour
at
the
notion
of
attending
a
baronet
in
the
country
what
influence
a
countess
have
on
him
when
he
is
softened
when
he
is
quite
ripe
we
will
break
the
secret
upon
him
bring
in
the
young
people
extort
the
paternal
benediction
and
finish
the
a
parcel
of
stuff
said
the
old
lady
take
your
hat
sir
come
away
miss
there
my
head
is
turned
another
way
good
night
young
and
who
knows
but
the
old
lady
thought
of
her
own
early
days
as
she
went
away
on
laura
arm
nodding
her
head
and
humming
to
herself
with
the
early
morning
came
laura
and
martha
according
to
appointment
and
the
desired
sensation
was
let
us
hope
effected
in
lamb
court
whence
the
three
proceeded
to
wait
upon
and
samuel
huxter
at
their
residence
in
charterhouse
lane
the
two
ladies
looked
at
each
other
with
great
interest
and
not
a
little
emotion
on
fanny
part
she
had
not
seen
her
guardian
as
she
was
pleased
to
call
pen
in
consequence
of
his
bequest
since
the
event
had
occurred
which
had
united
her
to
huxter
samuel
told
me
how
kind
you
had
been
she
said
you
were
always
very
kind
pendennis
and
and
i
hope
your
friend
is
better
who
was
took
ill
in
shepherd
inn
my
name
is
laura
said
the
other
with
a
blush
i
am
that
is
i
was
that
is
i
am
arthur
sister
and
we
shall
always
love
you
for
being
so
good
to
him
when
he
was
and
when
we
live
in
the
country
i
hope
we
shall
see
each
other
and
i
shall
be
always
happy
to
hear
of
your
happiness
we
are
going
to
do
what
you
and
huxter
have
done
where
is
huxter
what
nice
snug
lodgings
you
got
what
a
pretty
cat
while
fanny
is
answering
these
questions
in
reply
to
pen
laura
says
to
herself
well
now
really
is
this
the
creature
about
whom
we
were
all
so
frightened
what
could
he
see
in
her
she
a
homely
little
thing
but
such
manners
well
she
was
very
kind
to
him
bless
her
for
samuel
had
gone
out
to
meet
his
huxter
said
that
the
old
gentleman
was
to
arrive
that
day
at
the
somerset
in
the
strand
and
fanny
confessed
that
she
was
in
a
sad
tremor
about
the
meeting
if
his
parent
casts
him
off
what
are
we
to
do
she
said
i
shall
never
pardon
myself
for
bringing
ruing
on
my
you
must
intercede
for
us
arthur
if
mortal
man
can
you
can
bend
and
influence
huxter
fanny
still
regarded
pen
in
the
light
of
a
superior
being
that
was
evident
no
doubt
arthur
thought
of
the
past
as
he
marked
the
solemn
little
and
looks
the
little
ways
the
little
trepidations
vanities
of
the
little
bride
as
soon
as
the
interview
was
over
entered
linton
and
blades
who
came
of
course
to
visit
huxter
and
brought
with
them
a
fine
fragrance
of
tobacco
they
had
watched
the
carriage
at
the
baker
door
and
remarked
the
coronet
with
awe
they
asked
of
fanny
who
was
that
uncommonly
heavy
swell
who
had
just
driven
off
and
pronounced
the
countess
was
of
the
right
sort
and
when
they
heard
that
it
was
pendennis
and
his
sister
they
remarked
that
pen
father
was
only
a
sawbones
and
that
he
gave
himself
confounded
airs
they
had
been
in
huxter
company
on
the
night
of
his
little
altercation
with
pen
in
the
back
kitchen
returning
homewards
through
fleet
street
and
as
laura
was
just
stating
to
pen
infinite
amusement
that
fanny
was
very
well
but
that
really
there
was
no
beauty
in
her
there
might
be
but
she
could
not
see
it
as
they
were
locked
near
temple
bar
they
saw
young
huxter
returning
to
his
bride
the
governor
had
arrived
was
at
the
somerset
was
in
tolerable
something
about
the
railway
but
he
had
been
afraid
to
speak
about
about
that
business
would
pendennis
try
it
on
pen
said
he
would
go
and
call
at
that
moment
upon
huxter
and
see
what
might
be
done
huxter
junior
would
lurk
outside
whilst
that
awful
interview
took
place
the
coronet
on
the
carriage
inspired
his
soul
also
with
wonder
and
old
huxter
himself
beheld
it
with
delight
as
he
looked
from
the
window
on
that
strand
which
it
was
always
a
treat
to
him
to
survey
and
i
can
afford
to
give
myself
a
lark
sir
said
huxter
shaking
hands
with
pen
of
course
you
know
the
news
we
have
got
our
bill
sir
we
shall
have
our
branch
line
our
shares
are
up
sir
and
we
buy
your
three
fields
along
the
brawl
and
put
a
pretty
penny
into
your
pocket
indeed
that
was
good
pen
remembered
that
there
was
a
letter
from
tatham
at
chambers
these
three
days
but
he
had
not
opened
the
communication
being
interested
with
other
affairs
i
hope
you
do
intend
to
grow
rich
and
give
up
practice
said
pen
we
ca
lose
you
at
clavering
huxter
though
i
hear
very
good
accounts
of
your
son
my
friend
goodenough
speaks
most
highly
of
his
talents
it
is
hard
that
a
man
of
your
eminence
though
should
be
kept
in
a
country
the
metropolis
would
have
been
my
sphere
of
action
sir
said
huxter
surveying
the
strand
but
a
man
takes
his
business
where
he
finds
it
and
i
succeeded
to
that
of
my
it
was
my
father
too
said
pen
i
sometimes
wish
i
had
followed
you
sir
have
taken
a
more
lofty
career
said
the
old
gentleman
you
aspire
to
the
senate
and
to
literary
honours
you
wield
the
pen
sir
and
move
in
the
circles
of
fashion
we
keep
an
eye
upon
you
at
clavering
we
read
your
name
in
the
lists
of
the
select
parties
of
the
nobility
why
it
was
only
the
other
day
that
my
wife
was
remarking
how
odd
it
was
that
at
a
party
at
the
earl
of
kidderminster
your
name
was
not
mentioned
to
what
member
of
the
aristocracy
may
i
ask
does
that
equipage
belong
from
which
i
saw
you
descend
the
countess
dowager
of
rockminster
how
is
her
ladyship
her
ladyship
is
not
very
well
and
when
i
heard
that
you
were
coming
to
town
i
strongly
urged
her
to
see
you
huxter
pen
said
old
huxter
felt
if
he
had
a
hundred
votes
for
clavering
he
would
give
them
all
to
pen
there
is
an
old
friend
of
yours
in
the
carriage
a
clavering
lady
too
will
you
come
out
and
speak
to
her
asked
pen
the
old
surgeon
was
delighted
to
speak
to
a
coroneted
carriage
in
the
midst
of
the
full
strand
he
ran
out
bowing
and
smiling
huxter
junior
dodging
about
the
district
beheld
the
meeting
between
his
father
and
laura
saw
the
latter
put
out
her
hand
and
presently
after
a
little
colloquy
with
pen
beheld
his
father
actually
jump
into
the
carriage
and
drive
away
with
miss
bell
there
was
no
room
for
arthur
who
came
back
laughing
to
the
young
surgeon
and
told
him
whither
his
parent
was
bound
during
the
whole
of
the
journey
that
artful
laura
coaxed
and
wheedled
and
cajoled
him
so
adroitly
that
the
old
gentleman
would
have
granted
her
anything
and
lady
rockminster
achieved
the
victory
over
him
by
complimenting
him
on
his
skill
and
professing
her
anxiety
to
consult
him
what
were
her
ladyship
symptoms
should
he
meet
her
ladyship
usual
medical
attendant
jones
was
called
out
of
town
he
should
be
delighted
to
devote
his
very
best
energies
and
experience
to
her
ladyship
service
he
was
so
charmed
with
his
patient
that
he
wrote
home
about
her
to
his
wife
and
family
he
talked
of
nothing
but
lady
rockminster
to
samuel
when
that
youth
came
to
partake
of
beefsteak
and
and
accompany
his
parent
to
the
play
there
was
a
simple
grandeur
a
polite
urbanity
a
grace
about
her
ladyship
which
he
had
never
witnessed
in
any
woman
her
symptoms
did
not
seem
alarming
he
had
prescribed
spir
ammon
aromat
with
a
little
spir
menth
pip
and
which
would
be
all
that
was
necessary
miss
bell
seemed
to
be
on
the
most
confidential
and
affectionate
footing
with
her
ladyship
she
was
about
to
form
a
matrimonial
connexion
all
young
people
ought
to
marry
such
were
her
words
and
the
countess
condescended
to
ask
respecting
my
own
family
and
i
mentioned
you
by
name
to
her
ladyship
sam
my
boy
i
shall
look
in
when
if
the
remedies
which
i
have
prescribed
for
her
ladyship
have
had
the
effect
which
i
anticipate
i
shall
probably
follow
them
up
by
a
little
spir
lavend
comp
and
so
set
my
noble
patient
up
what
is
the
theatre
which
is
most
frequented
by
the
by
the
higher
classes
in
town
hey
sam
and
to
what
amusement
will
you
take
an
old
country
doctor
hey
sir
on
the
next
day
when
huxter
called
in
jermyn
street
at
twelve
lady
rockminster
had
not
yet
left
her
room
but
miss
bell
and
pendennis
were
in
waiting
to
receive
him
lady
rockminster
had
had
a
most
comfortable
night
and
was
getting
on
as
well
as
possible
how
had
huxter
amused
himself
at
the
theatre
with
his
son
what
a
capital
piece
it
was
and
how
charmingly
looked
and
sang
it
and
what
a
good
fellow
young
huxter
was
liked
by
everybody
an
honour
to
his
profession
he
has
not
his
father
manners
i
grant
you
or
that
tone
which
is
passing
away
from
us
but
a
more
excellent
sterling
fellow
never
lived
he
ought
to
practise
in
the
country
whatever
you
do
sir
said
arthur
he
ought
to
marry
other
people
are
going
to
do
so
and
the
very
words
that
her
ladyship
used
yesterday
pendennis
he
ought
to
marry
sam
should
marry
the
town
is
full
of
temptations
sir
continued
pen
the
old
gentleman
thought
of
that
houri
there
is
no
better
safeguard
for
a
young
man
than
an
early
marriage
with
an
honest
affectionate
no
better
sir
no
and
love
is
better
than
money
is
it
indeed
it
is
said
miss
bell
i
agree
with
so
fair
an
authority
said
the
old
gentleman
with
a
bow
and
and
suppose
sir
pen
said
that
i
had
a
piece
of
news
to
communicate
to
god
bless
my
soul
pendennis
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
old
gentleman
suppose
i
had
to
tell
you
that
a
young
man
carried
away
by
an
irresistible
passion
for
an
admirable
and
most
virtuous
young
creature
whom
everybody
falls
in
love
with
had
consulted
the
dictates
of
reason
and
his
heart
and
had
married
suppose
i
were
to
tell
you
that
that
man
is
my
friend
that
our
excellent
our
truly
noble
friend
the
countess
dowager
of
rockminster
is
truly
interested
about
him
and
you
may
fancy
what
a
young
man
can
do
in
life
when
that
family
is
interested
for
him
suppose
i
were
to
tell
you
that
you
know
him
that
he
is
here
that
he
is
sam
married
god
bless
my
soul
sir
you
do
mean
that
and
to
such
a
nice
creature
dear
her
ladyship
is
charmed
with
her
said
pen
telling
almost
the
first
fib
which
he
has
told
in
the
course
of
this
story
married
the
rascal
is
he
thought
the
old
gentleman
they
will
do
it
sir
said
pen
and
went
and
opened
the
door
and
samuel
huxter
issued
thence
and
both
came
and
knelt
down
before
the
old
gentleman
the
kneeling
little
fanny
found
favour
in
his
sight
there
must
have
been
some
thing
attractive
about
her
in
spite
of
laura
opinion
will
never
do
so
any
more
sir
said
sam
get
up
sir
said
huxter
and
they
got
up
and
fanny
came
a
little
nearer
and
a
little
nearer
still
and
looked
so
pretty
and
pitiful
that
somehow
huxter
found
himself
kissing
the
little
thing
and
feeling
as
if
he
liked
it
what
your
name
my
dear
he
said
after
a
minute
of
this
sport

he

about

accomplished
and
lovely

family
at
clavering
park
lady
clavering
and
miss
amory
have
arrived
at
the
park
for
the
christmas
holidays
and
we
understand
that
a
large
number
of
the
aristocracy
are
expected
and
that
festivities
of
a
peculiarly
interesting
nature
will
take
place
there
at
the
commencement
of

new
the
ingenious
reader
will
be
enabled
by
the
help
of
the
above
announcement
to
understand
what
has
taken
place
during
the
little
break
which
has
occurred
in
our
narrative
although
lady
rockminster
grumbled
a
little
at
laura
preference
for
pendennis
over
bluebeard
those
who
are
aware
of
the
latter
secret
will
understand
that
the
young
girl
could
make
no
other
choice
and
the
kind
old
lady
who
had
constituted
herself
miss
bell
guardian
was
not
ill
pleased
that
she
was
to
fulfil
the
great
purpose
in
life
of
young
ladies
and
marry
she
informed
her
maid
of
the
interesting
event
that
very
night
and
of
course
beck
who
was
perfectly
aware
of
every
single
circumstance
and
kept
by
martha
of
fairoaks
in
the
fullest
knowledge
of
what
was
passing
was
immensely
surprised
and
delighted
mr
pendennis
income
is
so
much
the
railroad
will
give
him
so
much
more
he
states
miss
bell
has
so
much
and
may
probably
have
a
little
more
one
day
for
persons
in
their
degree
they
will
be
able
to
manage
very
well
and
i
shall
speak
to
my
nephew
pynsent
who
i
suspect
was
once
rather
attached
to
her
but
of
course
that
was
out
of
the
question
of
course
my
lady
i
should
think
so
indeed
not
that
you
know
anything
whatever
about
it
or
have
any
business
to
think
at
all
on
the
subject
i
shall
speak
to
george
pynsent
who
is
now
chief
secretary
of
the
tape
and
sealing
wax
office
and
have
pendennis
made
something
and
beck
in
the
morning
you
will
carry
down
my
compliments
to
major
pendennis
and
say
that
i
shall
pay
him
a
visit
at
one
yes
muttered
the
old
lady
the
major
must
be
reconciled
and
he
must
leave
his
fortune
to
accordingly
at
one
the
dowager
lady
rockminster
appeared
at
major
pendennis
who
was
delighted
as
may
be
imagined
to
receive
so
noble
a
visitor
the
major
had
been
prepared
if
not
for
the
news
which
her
ladyship
was
about
to
give
him
at
least
with
the
intelligence
that
pen
marriage
with
miss
amory
was
broken
off
the
young
gentleman
bethinking
him
of
his
uncle
for
the
first
time
that
day
it
must
be
owned
and
meeting
his
new
servant
in
the
hall
of
the
hotel
asked
after
the
major
health
from
frosch
and
then
went
into
the
of
the
hotel
where
he
wrote
a
lines
to
acquaint
his
guardian
with
what
had
occurred
dear
uncle
he
said
if
there
has
been
any
question
between
us
it
is
over
now
i
went
to
tunbridge
wells
yesterday
and
found
that
somebody
else
had
carried
off
the
prize
about
which
we
were
hesitating
miss
without
any
compunction
for
me
has
bestowed
herself
upon
harry
foker
with
his
fifteen
thousand
a
year
i
came
in
suddenly
upon
their
loves
and
found
and
left
him
in
possession
and
you
be
glad
to
hear
tatham
writes
me
that
he
has
sold
three
of
my
fields
at
fairoaks
to
the
railroad
company
at
a
great
figure
i
will
tell
you
this
and
more
when
we
meet
and
am
always
your
affectionate
i
think
i
am
aware
of
what
you
were
about
to
tell
me
the
major
said
with
a
most
courtly
smile
and
bow
to
pen
ambassadress
it
was
a
very
great
kindness
of
your
ladyship
to
think
of
bringing
me
the
news
how
well
you
look
how
very
good
you
are
how
very
kind
you
have
always
been
to
that
young
man
it
was
for
the
sake
of
his
uncle
said
lady
rockminster
most
politely
he
has
informed
me
of
the
state
of
affairs
and
written
me
a
nice
note
yes
a
nice
note
continued
the
old
gentleman
and
i
find
he
has
had
an
increase
to
his
fortune
yes
and
all
things
considered
i
do
much
regret
that
this
affair
with
miss
amory
is
manquee
though
i
wished
for
it
once
in
fact
all
things
considered
i
am
very
glad
of
we
must
console
him
major
pendennis
continued
the
lady
we
must
get
him
a
the
truth
then
came
across
the
major
mind
and
he
saw
for
what
purpose
lady
rockminster
had
chosen
to
assume
the
office
of
ambassadress
it
is
not
necessary
to
enter
into
the
conversation
which
ensued
or
to
tell
at
any
length
how
her
ladyship
concluded
a
negotiation
which
in
truth
was
tolerably
easy
there
could
be
no
reason
why
pen
should
not
marry
according
to
his
own
and
his
mother
wish
and
as
for
lady
rockminster
she
supported
the
marriage
by
intimations
which
had
very
great
weight
with
the
major
but
of
which
we
shall
say
nothing
as
her
ladyship
now
of
course
much
advanced
in
years
is
still
alive
and
the
family
might
be
angry
and
in
fine
the
old
gentleman
was
quite
overcome
by
the
determined
graciousness
of
the
lady
and
her
fondness
for
laura
nothing
indeed
could
be
more
bland
and
kind
than
lady
rockminster
whole
demeanour
except
for
one
moment
when
the
major
talked
about
his
boy
throwing
himself
away
at
which
her
ladyship
broke
out
into
a
little
speech
in
which
she
made
the
major
understand
what
poor
pen
and
his
friends
acknowledge
very
humbly
that
laura
was
a
thousand
times
too
good
for
him
laura
was
fit
to
be
the
wife
of
a
king
laura
was
a
paragon
of
virtue
and
excellence
and
it
must
be
said
that
when
major
pendennis
found
that
a
lady
of
the
rank
of
the
countess
of
rockminster
seriously
admired
miss
bell
he
instantly
began
to
admire
her
himself
so
that
when
herr
frosch
was
requested
to
walk
upstairs
to
lady
rockminster
apartments
and
inform
miss
bell
and
arthur
pendennis
that
the
major
would
receive
them
and
laura
appeared
blushing
and
happy
as
she
hung
on
pen
arm
the
major
gave
a
shaky
hand
to
one
and
the
other
with
unaffected
emotion
and
cordiality
and
then
went
through
another
salutation
to
laura
which
caused
her
to
blush
still
more
happy
blushes
bright
eyes
beaming
with
the
light
of
love
the
turns
from
this
group
to
his
young
audience
and
hopes
that
one
day
their
eyes
may
all
shine
so
pen
having
retreated
in
the
most
friendly
manner
and
the
lovely
blanche
having
bestowed
her
young
affections
upon
a
blushing
bridegroom
with
fifteen
thousand
a
year
there
was
such
an
outbreak
of
happiness
in
lady
clavering
heart
and
family
as
the
good
begum
had
not
known
for
many
a
year
and
she
and
blanche
were
on
the
most
delightful
terms
of
cordiality
and
affection
the
ardent
foker
pressed
onwards
the
happy
day
and
was
as
anxious
as
might
be
expected
to
abridge
the
period
of
mourning
which
had
put
him
in
possession
of
so
many
charms
and
amiable
qualities
of
which
he
had
been
only
as
it
were
the
not
the
actual
owner
until
then
the
gentle
blanche
everything
that
her
affianced
lord
could
desire
was
not
averse
to
gratify
the
wishes
of
her
fond
henry
lady
clavering
came
up
from
tunbridge
milliners
and
jewellers
were
set
to
work
and
engaged
to
prepare
the
delightful
paraphernalia
of
hymen
lady
clavering
was
in
such
a
good
humour
that
sir
francis
even
benefited
by
it
and
such
a
reconciliation
was
effected
between
this
pair
that
sir
francis
came
to
london
sate
at
the
head
of
his
own
table
once
more
and
appeared
tolerably
flush
of
money
at
his
and
again
one
day
when
major
pendennis
and
arthur
went
to
dine
in
grosvenor
place
they
found
an
old
acquaintance
established
in
the
quality
of
and
the
gentleman
in
black
who
with
perfect
politeness
and
gravity
offered
them
their
choice
of
sweet
or
dry
champagne
was
no
other
than
james
morgan
the
chevalier
strong
was
one
of
the
party
he
was
in
high
spirits
and
condition
and
entertained
the
company
with
accounts
of
his
amusements
abroad
it
was
my
lady
who
invited
me
said
strong
to
arthur
under
his
voice
that
fellow
morgan
looked
as
black
as
thunder
when
i
came
in
he
is
about
no
good
here
i
will
go
away
first
and
wait
for
you
and
major
pendennis
at
hyde
park
morgan
helped
major
pendennis
to
his
when
he
was
quitting
the
house
and
muttered
something
about
having
accepted
a
temporary
engagement
with
the
clavering
family
i
have
got
a
paper
of
yours
morgan
said
the
old
gentleman
which
you
can
show
if
you
please
to
sir
francis

and
perfectly

morgan
with
downcast
eyes
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
major
pendennis
and
if
i
can
pay
you
for
all
your
kindness
i
arthur
overheard
the
sentence
and
saw
the
look
of
hatred
which
accompanied
it
suddenly
cried
out
that
he
had
forgotten
his
handkerchief
and
ran
upstairs
to
the
again
foker
was
still
there
still
lingering
about
his
siren
pen
gave
the
siren
a
look
full
of
meaning
and
we
suppose
that
the
siren
understood
meaning
looks
for
when
after
finding
the
veracious
handkerchief
of
which
he
came
in
quest
he
once
more
went
out
the
siren
with
a
laughing
voice
said
oh
arthur
pendennis
i
want
you
to
tell
dear
laura
something
and
she
came
out
to
the
door
what
is
it
she
asked

the
door

you
told
harry

promised

after
our
marriage

how
wretched

said
the
girl
who
had
been
all
smiles
and
grace
and
gaiety
during
the
evening
arthur
said
i
beg
and
implore
you
to
tell

and
if

rockminster

spare
her
i
should
so
like
to
drive
with
her
in
the
park
and
she
went
in
singing
and
kissing
her
little
hand
as
morgan
the
came
up
the
carpeted
stair
pen
heard
blanche
piano
breaking
out
into
brilliant
music
as
he
went
down
to
join
his
uncle
and
they
walked
away
together
arthur
briefly
told
him
what
he
had
done
what
was
to
be
done
he
asked
what
is
to
be
done
begad
said
the
old
gentleman
what
is
to
be
done
but
to
leave
it
alone
begad
let
us
be
thankful
said
the
old
fellow
with
a
shudder
that
we
are
out
of
the
business
and
leave
it
to
those
it
i
hope
to
heaven
she
tell
him
said
pen
begad
she
take
her
own
course
said
the
old
man
miss
amory
is
a
girl
sir
and
must
play
her
own
cards
and
doosid
glad
you
are
out
of
it
doosid
glad
begad
who
this
smoking
oh
it
strong
again
he
wants
to
put
in
his
oar
i
suppose
i
tell
you
do
meddle
in
the
business
strong
began
once
or
twice
as
if
to
converse
upon
the
subject
but
the
major
would
not
hear
a
word
he
remarked
on
the
moonlight
on
apsley
house
the
weather
the
cabstands
anything
but
that
subject
he
bowed
stiffly
to
strong
and
clung
to
his
nephew
arm
as
he
turned
down
james
street
and
again
cautioned
pen
to
leave
the
affair
alone
it
had
like
to
have
cost
you
so
much
sir
that
you
may
take
my
advice
he
said
when
arthur
came
out
of
the
hotel
strong
cloak
and
cigar
were
visible
a
few
doors
off
the
jolly
chevalier
laughed
as
they
met
i
an
old
soldier
too
he
said
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
pendennis
i
have
heard
of
all
that
has
happened
and
all
the
chops
and
changes
that
have
taken
place
during
my
absence
i
congratulate
you
on
your
marriage
and
i
congratulate
you
on
your
escape
too
you
understand
me
it
was
not
my
business
to
speak
but
i
know
this
that
a
certain
party
is
as
arrant
a
little
well
well
never
mind
what
you
acted
like
a
man
and
a
trump
and
are
well
out
of
i
have
no
reason
to
complain
said
pen
i
went
back
to
beg
and
entreat
poor
blanche
to
tell
foker
all
i
hope
for
her
sake
she
will
but
i
fear
not
there
is
but
one
policy
strong
there
is
but
and
lucky
he
that
can
stick
to
it
said
the
chevalier
that
rascal
morgan
means
mischief
he
has
been
lurking
about
our
chambers
for
the
last
two
months
he
has
found
out
that
poor
mad
devil
amory
secret
he
has
been
trying
to
discover
where
he
was
he
has
been
pumping
bolton
and
making
old
costigan
drunk
several
times
he
bribed
the
inn
porter
to
tell
him
when
we
came
back
and
he
has
got
into
service
on
the
strength
of
his
information
he
will
get
very
good
pay
for
it
mark
my
words
the
where
is
amory
asked
pen
at
boulogne
i
believe
i
left
him
there
and
warned
him
not
to
come
back
i
have
broken
with
him
after
a
desperate
quarrel
such
as
one
might
have
expected
with
such
a
madman
and
i
glad
to
think
that
he
is
in
my
debt
now
and
that
i
have
been
the
means
of
keeping
him
out
of
more
harms
than
he
has
lost
all
his
winnings
i
suppose
said
pen
no
he
is
rather
better
than
when
he
went
away
or
was
a
fortnight
ago
he
had
extraordinary
luck
at
baden
broke
the
bank
several
nights
and
was
the
fable
of
the
place
he
lied
himself
there
with
a
fellow
by
the
name
of
bloundell
who
gathered
about
him
a
society
of
all
sorts
of
sharpers
male
and
female
russians
germans
french
english
amory
got
so
insolent
that
i
was
obliged
to
thrash
him
one
day
within
an
inch
of
his
life
i
could
help
myself
the
fellow
has
plenty
of
pluck
and
i
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
hit
and
did
he
call
you
out
said
pen
you
think
if
i
had
shot
him
i
should
have
done
nobody
any
harm
no
sir
i
waited
for
his
challenge
but
it
never
came
and
the
next
time
i
met
him
he
begged
my
pardon
and
said
i
beg
your
pardon
you
whopped
me
and
you
served
me
right
i
shook
hands
but
i
could
live
with
him
after
that
i
paid
him
what
i
owed
him
the
night
before
said
strong
with
a
blush
i
pawned
everything
to
pay
him
and
then
i
went
with
my
last
ten
florins
and
had
a
shy
at
the
roulette
if
i
had
lost
i
should
have
let
him
shoot
me
in
the
morning
i
was
weary
of
my
life
by
jove
sir
is
it
a
shame
that
a
man
like
me
who
may
have
had
a
few
bills
out
but
who
never
deserted
a
friend
or
did
an
unfair
action
should
be
able
to
turn
his
hand
to
anything
to
get
bread
i
made
a
good
night
sir
at
roulette
and
i
done
with
that
i
going
into
the
wine
business
my
wife
relations
live
at
cadiz
i
intend
to
bring
over
spanish
wine
and
hams
there
a
fortune
to
be
made
by
it
sir
a
fortune
here
my
card
if
you
want
any
sherry
or
hams
recollect
ned
strong
is
your
and
the
chevalier
pulled
out
a
handsome
card
stating
that
strong
and
company
shepherd
inn
were
sole
agents
of
the
celebrated
diamond
manzanilla
of
the
duke
of
garbanzos
grandee
of
spain
of
the
first
class
and
of
the
famous
toboso
hams
fed
on
acorns
only
in
the
country
of
don
quixote
come
and
taste
sir
come
and
try
at
my
chambers
you
see
i
an
eye
to
business
and
by
jove
this
time
i
pen
laughed
as
he
took
the
card
i
do
know
whether
i
shall
be
allowed
to
go
to
bachelors
parties
he
said
you
know
i
going
to
but
you
must
have
sherry
sir
you
must
have
i
will
have
it
from
you
depend
on
it
said
the
other
and
i
think
you
are
very
well
out
of
your
other
partnership
that
worthy
altamont
and
his
daughter
correspond
i
hear
pen
added
after
a
pause
yes
she
wrote
him
the
longest
rigmarole
letters
that
i
used
to
read
the
sly
little
devil
and
he
answered
under
cover
to
bonner
he
was
for
carrying
her
off
the
first
day
or
two
and
nothing
would
content
him
but
having
back
his
child
but
she
did
want
to
come
as
you
may
fancy
and
he
was
not
very
eager
about
here
the
chevalier
burst
out
in
a
laugh
why
sir
do
you
know
what
was
the
cause
of
our
quarrel
and
boxing
match
there
was
a
certain
widow
at
baden
a
madame
la
baronne
de
la
who
was
not
much
better
than
himself
and
whom
the
scoundrel
wanted
to
marry
and
would
but
that
i
told
her
he
was
married
already
i
do
think
that
she
was
much
better
than
he
was
i
saw
her
on
the
pier
at
boulogne
the
day
i
came
to
and
now
we
have
brought
up
our
narrative
to
the
point
whither
the
announcement
in
the
chatteris
champion
had
already
conducted
us
it
wanted
but
very
very
few
days
before
that
blissful
one
when
foker
should
call
blanche
his
own
the
clavering
folks
had
all
pressed
to
see
the
most
splendid
new
carriage
in
the
whole
world
which
was
standing
in
the
at
the
clavering
arms
and
shown
in
grateful
return
for
drink
commonly
by
foker
madame
fribsby
was
occupied
in
making
some
lovely
dresses
for
the
tenants
daughters
who
were
to
figure
as
a
sort
of
bridesmaids
chorus
at
the
breakfast
and
marriage
ceremony
and
immense
festivities
were
to
take
place
at
the
park
upon
this
delightful
occasion
yes
huxter
yes
a
happy
tenantry
its
country
pride
will
assemble
in
the
baronial
hall
where
the
beards
will
wag
all
the
ox
shall
be
slain
and
the
cup
they
drain
and
the
bells
shall
peal
quite
genteel
and
my
with
the
tear
of
sensibility
bedewing
his
eye
shall
bless
us
at
his
baronial
porch
that
shall
be
the
order
of
proceedings
i
think
huxter
and
i
hope
we
shall
see
you
and
your
lovely
bride
by
her
husband
side
and
what
will
you
please
to
drink
sir
lightfoot
madam
you
will
give
to
my
excellent
friend
and
huxter
samuel
huxter
every
refreshment
that
your
hostel
affords
and
place
the
festive
amount
to
my
account
and
lightfoot
sir
what
will
you
take
though
you
had
enough
already
i
think
yes
so
spoke
harry
foker
in
the
bar
of
the
clavering
arms
he
had
apartments
at
that
hotel
and
had
gathered
a
circle
of
friends
round
him
there
he
treated
all
to
drink
who
came
he
was
with
every
man
he
was
so
happy
he
danced
round
madame
fribsby
lightfoot
great
ally
as
she
sate
pensive
in
the
bar
he
consoled
lightfoot
who
had
already
begun
to
have
causes
of
matrimonial
disquiet
for
the
truth
must
be
told
that
young
lightfoot
having
now
the
full
command
of
the
cellar
had
none
over
his
own
unbridled
desires
and
was
tippling
and
tipsy
from
morning
till
night
and
a
piteous
sight
it
was
for
his
fond
wife
to
behold
the
big
youth
reeling
about
the
yard
and
or
drinking
with
the
farmers
and
tradesmen
his
own
neat
wines
and
carefully
selected
stock
of
spirits
when
he
could
find
time
morgan
the
butler
came
from
the
park
and
took
a
glass
at
the
expense
of
the
landlord
of
the
clavering
arms
he
watched
poor
lightfoot
tipsy
vagaries
with
savage
sneers
lightfoot
felt
always
doubly
uncomfortable
when
her
unhappy
spouse
was
under
his
comrade
eye
but
a
few
months
married
and
to
think
he
had
got
to
this
madame
fribsby
could
feel
for
her
madame
fribsby
could
tell
her
stories
of
men
every
bit
as
bad
she
had
had
her
own
woes
too
and
her
sad
experience
of
men
so
it
is
that
nobody
seems
happy
altogether
and
that
there
bitters
as
foker
remarked
in
the
cup
of
every
man
life
and
yet
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
in
his
the
honest
young
fellow
it
was
brimming
over
with
happiness
and
morgan
was
constant
in
his
attentions
to
foker
and
yet
i
like
him
somehow
said
the
candid
young
man
to
lightfoot
he
always
seems
as
if
he
was
measuring
me
for
my
coffin
somehow
afraid
of
him
ahem
never
mind
but
a
trump
indeed
my
lady
was
and
lightfoot
owned
with
a
sigh
that
perhaps
it
had
been
better
for
her
had
she
never
left
her
mistress
no
i
do
not
like
thee
fell
the
reason
why
i
can
not
tell
continued
foker
and
he
wants
to
be
taken
as
my
head
man
blanche
wants
me
to
take
him
why
does
miss
amory
like
him
so
did
miss
blanche
like
him
so
the
notion
seemed
to
disturb
lightfoot
very
much
and
there
came
to
this
worthy
landlady
another
cause
for
disturbance
a
letter
bearing
the
boulogne
postmark
was
brought
to
her
one
morning
and
she
and
her
husband
were
quarrelling
over
it
as
foker
passed
down
the
stairs
by
the
bar
on
his
way
to
the
park
his
custom
was
to
breakfast
there
and
bask
a
while
in
the
presence
of
armida
then
as
the
company
of
clavering
tired
him
exceedingly
and
he
did
not
care
for
sporting
he
would
return
for
an
hour
or
two
to
billiards
and
the
society
of
the
clavering
arms
then
it
would
be
time
to
ride
with
miss
amory
and
after
dining
with
her
he
left
her
and
returned
modestly
to
his
inn
lightfoot
and
his
wife
were
quarrelling
over
the
letter
what
was
that
letter
from
abroad
why
was
she
always
having
letters
from
abroad
who
wrote
he
would
know
he
did
believe
it
was
her
brother
it
was
no
business
of
his
it
was
a
business
of
his
and
with
a
curse
he
seized
hold
of
his
wife
and
dashed
at
her
pocket
for
the
letter
the
poor
woman

a
face
beaming
with

foker
shaking

and
looked
at
the
superscription
as
she
looked
at

in
every
limb
and
with
a
scared

she
dropped

a
sob

do
think

a
pretty

a
beauty
but
he

the
rowdy
which

the
thing

and
the
distracted

out
into
hysterical
screams
and
convulsively
grasped
her
son
they

made
an
outcast
of

said
foker
going
up
and
kissing
her
hand
generous
generous
harry
cried
out
blanche
in
an
ecstasy
but
he
withdrew
his
hand
which
was
upon
her
side
and
turned
from
her
with
a
quivering
lip
that
different
he
says
it
was
for
her
sake
for
her
sake
again
miss

but
we
honest
yes
we
are
all
this
while
a
strange
feeling
of
exultation
had
taken
possession
of
blanche
mind
that
month
with
poor
harry
had
been
a
weary
month
to
her
all
his
fortune
and
splendour
scarcely
sufficed
to
make
the
idea
of
himself
supportable
she
was
wearied
of
his
simple
ways
and
sick
of
coaxing
and
cajoling
him
stay
mamma
stay
madam
she
cried
out
with
a
gesture
which
was
always
appropriate
though
rather
theatrical
i
have
no
heart
have
i
i
keep
the
secret
of
my
mother
shame
i
give
up
my
rights
to
my

my
fortune

my
father
and
for

i
have
no
heart

laws

country

them
to
me
i
appeal
to
my
country
laws
yes
my
country
laws
the
persecuted
one
returns
this
day
i
desire
to
go
to
my
and
the
little
lady
swept
round
her
hand
and
thought
that
she
was
a
heroine
you
will
will
you
cried
out
clavering
with
one
of
his
usual
oaths
i
a
magistrate
and
dammy
i
commit
him
here
a
chaise
coming
perhaps
it
him
let
him
a
chaise
was
indeed
coming
up
the
avenue
and
the
two
women
shrieked
each
their
loudest
expecting
at
that
moment
to
see
altamont
arrive
the
door
opened
and
morgan
announced
major
pendennis
and
pendennis
who
entered
and
found
all
parties
engaged
in
this
fierce
quarrel
a
large
screen
fenced
the
from
the
hall
and
it
is
probable
that
according
to
his
custom
morgan
had
taken
advantage
of
the
screen
to
make
himself
acquainted
with
all
that
occurred
it
had
been
arranged
on
the
previous
day
that
the
young
people
should
ride
and
at
the
appointed
hour
in
the
afternoon
foker
horses
arrived
from
the
clavering
arms
but
miss
blanche
did
not
accompany
him
on
this
occasion
pen
came
out
and
shook
hands
with
him
on
the
and
harry
foker
rode
away
followed
by
his
groom
in
mourning
the
whole
transactions
which
have
occupied
the
most
active
part
of
our
history
were
debated
by
the
parties
concerned
during
those
two
or
three
hours
many
counsels
had
been
given
stories
told
and
compromises
suggested
and
at
the
end
harry
foker
rode
away
with
a
sad
god
bless
you
from
pen
there
was
a
dreary
dinner
at
clavering
park
at
which
the
lately
installed
butler
did
not
attend
and
the
ladies
were
both
absent
after
dinner
pen
said
i
will
walk
down
to
clavering
and
see
if
he
is
and
he
walked
through
the
dark
avenue
across
the
bridge
and
road
by
his
own
cottage
the
once
quiet
and
familiar
fields
of
which
were
flaming
with
the
kilns
and
forges
of
the
artificers
employed
on
the
new
railroad
works
and
so
he
entered
the
town
and
made
for
the
clavering
arms
it
was
past
midnight
when
he
returned
to
clavering
park
he
was
exceedingly
pale
and
agitated
is
lady
clavering
up
yet
he
asked
yes
she
was
in
her
own
he
went
up
to
her
and
there
found
the
poor
lady
in
a
piteous
state
of
tears
and
agitation
it
is
i
arthur
he
said
looking
in
and
entering
he
took
her
hand
very
affectionately
and
kissed
it
you
were
always
the
kindest
of
friends
to
me
dear
lady
clavering
he
said
i
love
you
very
much
i
have
got
some
news
for
do
call
me
by
that
name
she
said
pressing
his
hand
you
were
always
a
good
boy
arthur
and
it
kind
of
you
to
come
now
very
kind
you
sometimes
look
very
like
your
ma
my
dear
good
lady
clavering
arthur
repeated
with
particular
emphasis
something
very
strange
has
has
anything
happened
to
him
gasped
lady
clavering
oh
it
horrid
to
think
i
should
be
glad
of
it
horrid
he
is
well
he
has
been
and
is
gone
my
dear
lady
do
alarm
yourself
he
is
gone
and
you
are
lady
clavering
is
it
true
what
he
sometimes
said
to
me
she
screamed
out
that
he
he
was
married
before
he
married
you
said
pen
he
has
confessed
it
he
will
never
come
there
came
another
shriek
from
lady
clavering
as
she
flung
her
arms
round
pen
and
kissed
him
and
burst
into
tears
on
his
shoulder
what
pen
had
to
tell
through
a
multiplicity
of
sobs
and
interruptions
must
be
compressed
briefly
for
behold
our
prescribed
limit
is
reached
and
our
tale
is
coming
to
its
end
with
the
branch
coach
from
the
railroad
which
had
succeeded
the
old
alacrity
and
perseverance
amory
arrived
and
was
set
down
at
the
clavering
arms
he
ordered
his
dinner
at
the
place
under
his
assumed
name
of
altamont
and
being
of
a
jovial
turn
he
welcomed
the
landlord
who
was
nothing
loth
to
a
share
of
his
wine
having
extracted
from
lightfoot
all
the
news
regarding
the
family
at
the
park
and
found
from
examining
his
host
that
lightfoot
as
she
said
had
kept
his
counsel
he
called
for
more
wine
of
lightfoot
and
at
the
end
of
this
symposium
both
being
greatly
excited
went
into
lightfoot
bar
she
was
there
taking
tea
with
her
friend
madame
fribsby
and
lightfoot
was
by
this
time
in
such
a
happy
state
as
not
to
be
surprised
at
anything
which
might
occur
so
that
when
altamont
shook
hands
with
lightfoot
as
an
old
acquaintance
the
recognition
did
not
appear
to
him
to
be
in
the
least
strange
but
only
a
reasonable
cause
for
further
drinking
the
gentlemen
partook
then
of
which
they
offered
to
the
ladies
not
heeding
the
terrified
looks
of
one
or
the
other
whilst
they
were
so
engaged
at
about
six
in
the
evening
morgan
sir
francis
clavering
new
man
came
in
and
was
requested
to
drink
he
selected
his
favourite
beverage
and
the
parties
engaged
in
general
conversation
after
a
while
lightfoot
began
to
doze
morgan
had
repeatedly
given
hints
to
fribsby
to
quit
the
premises
but
that
lady
strangely
fascinated
and
terrified
it
would
seem
or
persuaded
by
lightfoot
not
to
go
kept
her
place
her
persistence
occasioned
much
annoyance
to
morgan
who
vented
his
displeasure
in
such
language
as
gave
pain
to
lightfoot
and
caused
altamont
to
say
that
he
was
a
rum
customer
and
not
polite
to
the
sex
the
altercation
between
the
two
gentlemen
became
very
painful
to
the
women
especially
to
lightfoot
who
did
everything
to
soothe
morgan
and
under
pretence
of
giving
a
to
the
stranger
she
handed
him
a
paper
on
which
she
had
privily
written
the
words
he
knows
you
there
may
have
been
something
suspicious
in
her
manner
of
handing
or
in
her
guest
of
reading
the
paper
for
when
he
got
up
a
short
time
afterwards
and
said
he
would
go
to
bed
morgan
rose
too
with
a
laugh
and
said
it
was
too
early
to
go
to
bed
the
stranger
then
said
he
would
go
to
his
bedroom
morgan
said
he
would
show
him
the
way
at
this
the
guest
said
come
up
i
got
a
brace
of
pistols
up
there
to
blow
out
the
brains
of
any
traitor
or
skulking
spy
and
glared
so
fiercely
upon
morgan
that
the
latter
seizing
hold
of
lightfoot
by
the
collar
and
waking
him
said
john
amory
i
arrest
you

the
name

by
me
lightfoot
this
capture
is
worth
a
thousand
he
put
forward
his
hand
as
if
to
seize
his
prisoner
but
the
other
doubling
his
fist
gave
morgan
with
his
left
hand
so
fierce
a
blow
on
the
chest
that
it
knocked
him
back
behind
lightfoot
that
gentleman
who
was
athletic
and
courageous
said
he
would
knock
his
guest
head
off
and
prepared
to
do
so
as
the
stranger
tearing
off
his
coat
and
cursing
both
of
his
opponents
roared
to
them
to
come
on
but
with
a
piercing
scream
lightfoot
flung
herself
before
her
husband
whilst
with
another
and
louder
shriek
madame
fribsby
ran
to
the
stranger
and
calling
out
armstrong
johnny
armstrong
seized
hold
of
his
naked
arm
on
which
a
blue
tattooing
of
a
heart
and
were
visible
the
ejaculation
of
madame
fribsby
seemed
to
astound
and
sober
the
stranger
he
looked
down
upon
her
and
cried
out
it
polly
by
fribsby
continued
to
exclaim
this
is
not
amory

is
johnny
armstrong
my
wicked
wicked
husband

to
me
in
church

on

indiaman
and
he
left
me
two
months
after
the
wicked
wretch

is
john
armstrong

arm
which
he
made
for
the
stranger
said

and
let

on
and
try
what
they
can
do
against
a
british

it

still
called

but
lightfoot
said

lightfoot
and
so
they
kept
morgan
until
the
coach
came
and
amory
or
armstrong
went
away
back
to
london
morgan
had
followed
him
but
of
this
event
arthur
pendennis
did
not
inform
lady
clavering
and
left
her
invoking
blessings
upon
him
at
her
son
door
going
to
kiss
him
as
he
was
asleep
it
had
been
a
busy
day
we
have
to
chronicle
the
events
of
but
one
day
more
and
that
was
a
day
when
arthur
attired
in
a
new
hat
a
new
blue
and
blue
handkerchief
in
a
new
fancy
waistcoat
new
boots
and
new
presented
by
the
right
honourable
the
countess
dowager
of
rockminster
made
his
appearance
at
a
solitary
in
clavering
park
where
he
could
scarce
eat
a
single
morsel
of
food
two
letters
were
laid
by
his
worship
plate
and
he
chose
to
open
the
first
which
was
in
a
round
hand
in
preference
to
the
second
more
familiar
superscription
note
ran
as
follows
garbanzos
wine
company
shepherd
monday
my
dear
pendennis
in
congratulating
you
heartily
upon
the
event
which
is
to
make
you
happy
for
life
i
send
my
very
kindest
remembrances
to
pendennis
whom
i
hope
to
know
even
longer
than
i
have
already
known
her
and
when
i
call
her
attention
to
the
fact
that
one
of
the
most
necessary
articles
to
her
husband
comfort
is
pure
sherry
i
know
i
shall
have
her
for
a
customer
for
your
worship
sake
but
i
have
to
speak
to
you
of
other
than
my
own
concerns
yesterday
afternoon
a
certain
j
arrived
at
my
chambers
from
clavering
which
he
had
left
under
circumstances
of
which
you
are
doubtless
now
aware
in
spite
of
our
difference
i
could
not
but
give
him
food
and
shelter
and
he
partook
freely
both
of
the
garbanzos
amontillado
and
the
toboso
ham
and
he
told
me
what
had
happened
to
him
and
many
other
surprising
adventures
the
rascal
married
at
sixteen
and
has
repeatedly
since
performed
that
ceremony
in
sydney
in
new
zealand
in
south
america
in
newcastle
he
says
first
before
he
knew
our
poor
friend
the
milliner
he
is
a
perfect
don
juan
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
commendatore
had
at
last
overtaken
him
for
as
we
were
at
our
meal
there
came
three
heavy
knocks
at
my
outer
door
which
made
our
friend
start
i
have
sustained
a
siege
or
two
here
and
went
to
my
usual
place
to
reconnoitre
thank
my
stars
i
have
not
a
bill
out
in
the
world
and
besides
those
gentry
do
not
come
in
that
way
i
found
that
it
was
your
uncle
late
valet
morgan
and
a
policeman
i
think
a
sham
policeman
and
they
said
they
had
a
warrant
to
take
the
person
of
john
armstrong
alias
amory
alias
altamont
a
runaway
convict
and
threatened
to
break
in
the
oak
now
sir
in
my
own
days
of
captivity
i
had
discovered
a
little
passage
along
the
gutter
into
bows
and
costigan
window
and
i
sent
jack
alias
along
this
covered
way
not
without
terror
of
his
life
for
it
had
grown
very
cranky
and
then
after
a
parley
let
in
mons
morgan
and
friend
the
rascal
had
been
instructed
about
that
covered
way
for
he
made
for
the
room
instantly
telling
the
policeman
to
go
downstairs
and
keep
the
gate
and
he
charged
up
my
little
staircase
as
if
he
had
known
the
premises
as
he
was
going
out
of
the
window
we
heard
a
voice
that
you
know
from
bows
garret
saying
are
ye
and
hwhat
the
divvle
are
ye
at
you
betther
leave
the
gutther
bedad
there
a
man
killed
himself
already
and
as
morgan
crossing
over
and
looking
into
the
darkness
was
trying
to
see
whether
this
awful
news
was
true
he
took
a
broomstick
and
with
a
vigorous
dash
broke
down
the
pipe
of
communication
and
told
me
this
morning
with
great
glee
that
he
was
reminded
of
that
sthratagem
by
remembering
his
dorling
emilie
when
she
acted
the
pawrt
of
cora
in
the
plee
and
by
the
bridge
in
pezawro
bedad
i
wish
that
scoundrel
morgan
had
been
on
the
bridge
when
the
general
tried
his
if
i
hear
more
of
jack
alias
i
will
tell
you
he
has
got
plenty
of
money
still
and
i
wanted
him
to
send
some
to
our
poor
friend
the
milliner
but
the
scoundrel
laughed
and
said
he
had
no
more
than
he
wanted
but
offered
to
give
anybody
a
lock
of
his
hair
farewell
be
happy
and
believe
me
always
truly
yours
and
now
for
the
other
letter

pen
dear
old
fellow
and
he
kissed
the
seal
before
he
broke
it

god

back
to
your
affectionate

his
wife

this
letter
together
after
doctor
breakfast
was
over
and
the
guests
were
gone
and
when
the
carriage
was
waiting
amidst
the
crowd
at
the
doctor
outer
gate
but
the
wicket
led
into
the
churchyard
of
mary
where
the
bells
were
pealing
with
all
their
might
and
it
was
here
over
helen
green
grass
that
arthur
showed
his
wife
george
letter
for
which
of
those
two
for
grief
was
it
or
for
happiness
that
laura
tears
abundantly
fell
on
the
paper
and
once
more
in
the
presence
of
the
sacred
dust
she
kissed
and
blessed
her
arthur
there
was
only
one
marriage
on
that
day
at
clavering
church
for
in
spite
of
blanche
sacrifices
for
her
dearest
mother
honest
harry
foker
could
not
pardon
the
woman
who
had
deceived
her
husband
and
justly
argued
that
she
would
deceive
him
again
he
went
to
the
pyramids
and
syria
and
there
left
his
malady
behind
him
and
returned
with
a
fine
beard
and
a
supply
of
tarbooshes
and
nargillies
with
which
he
regales
all
his
friends
he
lives
splendidly
and
through
pen
mediation
gets
his
wine
from
the
celebrated
vintages
of
the
duke
of
garbanzos
as
for
poor
cos
his
fate
has
been
mentioned
in
an
early
part
of
this
story
no
very
glorious
end
could
be
expected
to
such
a
career
morgan
is
one
of
the
most
respectable
men
in
the
parish
of
james
and
in
the
present
political
movement
has
pronounced
himself
like
a
man
and
a
briton
and
bows
on
the
demise
of
piper
who
played
the
organ
at
clavering
little
sam
hunter
who
has
the
entire
command
of
doctor
portman
brought
bows
down
from
london
to
contest
the
and
her
candidate
carried
the
chair
when
sir
francis
clavering
quitted
this
worthless
life
the
same
little
indefatigable
canvasser
took
the
borough
by
storm
and
it
is
now
represented
by
arthur
pendennis
esq
blanche
amory
it
is
well
known
married
at
paris
and
the
saloons
of
madame
la
comtesse
de
montmorenci
de
valentinois
were
amongst
the
most
suivis
of
that
capital
the
duel
between
the
count
and
the
young
and
fiery
representative
of
the
mountain
alcide
de
mirobo
arose
solely
from
the
latter
questioning
at
the
club
the
titles
borne
by
the
former
nobleman
madame
de
montmorenci
de
valentinois
travelled
after
the
adventure
and
bungay
bought
her
poems
and
published
them
with
the
countess
coronet
emblazoned
on
the
countess
work
major
pendennis
became
very
serious
in
his
last
days
and
was
never
so
happy
as
when
laura
was
reading
to
him
with
her
sweet
voice
or
listening
to
his
stories
for
this
sweet
lady
is
the
friend
of
the
young
and
the
old
and
her
life
is
always
passed
in
making
other
lives
happy
and
what
sort
of
a
husband
would
this
pendennis
be
many
a
reader
will
ask
doubting
the
happiness
of
such
a
marriage
and
the
fortune
of
laura
the
querists
if
they
meet
her
are
referred
to
that
lady
herself
who
seeing
his
faults
and
wayward
moods
seeing
and
owning
that
there
are
men
better
than
he
loves
him
always
with
the
most
constant
affection
his
children
or
their
mother
have
never
heard
a
harsh
word
from
him
and
when
his
fits
of
moodiness
and
solitude
are
over
welcome
him
back
with
a
regard
and
confidence
his
friend
is
his
friend
still
entirely
that
malady
is
never
fatal
to
a
sound
organ
and
george
goes
through
his
part
of
godpapa
perfectly
and
lives
alone
if
mr
pen
works
have
procured
him
more
reputation
than
has
been
acquired
by
his
abler
friend
whom
no
one
knows
george
lives
contented
without
the
fame
if
the
best
men
do
not
draw
the
great
prizes
in
life
we
know
it
has
been
so
settled
by
the
ordainer
of
the
lottery
we
own
and
see
daily
how
the
false
and
worthless
live
and
prosper
while
the
good
are
called
away
and
the
dear
and
young
perish
untimely
we
perceive
in
every
man
life
the
maimed
happiness
the
frequent
falling
the
bootless
endeavour
the
struggle
of
right
and
wrong
in
which
the
strong
often
succumb
and
the
swift
fail
we
see
flowers
of
good
blooming
in
foul
places
as
in
the
most
lofty
and
splendid
fortunes
flaws
of
vice
and
meanness
and
stains
of
evil
and
knowing
how
mean
the
best
of
us
is
let
us
give
a
hand
of
charity
to
arthur
pendennis
with
all
his
faults
and
shortcomings
who
does
not
claim
to
be
a
hero
but
only
a
man
and
a
brother
the
end
